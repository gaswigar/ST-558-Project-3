third

i
on
being
an
american
apparently
there
are
those
who
begin
to
find
it
disagreeable
nay
impossible
their
anguish
fills
the
liberal
weeklies
and
every
ship
that
puts
out
from
new
york
carries
a
groaning
cargo
of
them
bound
for
paris
london
munich
rome
and
way
points
anywhere
to
escape
the
great
curses
and
atrocities
that
make
life
intolerable
for
them
at
home
let
me
say
at
once
that
i
find
little
to
cavil
at
in
their
basic
complaints
in
more
than
one
direction
indeed
i
probably
go
a
great
deal
further
than
even
the
young
intellectuals
it
is
for
example
one
of
my
firmest
and
most
sacred
beliefs
reached
after
an
inquiry
extending
over
a
score
of
years
and
supported
by
incessant
prayer
and
meditation
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
both
its
legislative
arm
and
its
executive
arm
is
ignorant
incompetent
corrupt
and
disgusting
and
from
this
judgment
i
except
no
more
than
twenty
living
lawmakers
and
no
more
than
twenty
executioners
of
their
laws
it
is
a
belief
no
less
piously
cherished
that
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
republic
is
stupid
dishonest
and
against
all
reason
and
equity
and
from
this
judgment
i
except
no
more
than
thirty
judges
including
two
upon
the
bench
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
it
is
another
that
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
its
habitual
manner
of
dealing
with
other
nations
whether
friend
or
foe
is
hypocritical
disingenuous
knavish
and
dishonorable
and
from
this
judgment
i
consent
to
no
exceptions
whatever
either
recent
or
long
past
and
it
is
my
fourth
and
to
avoid
too
depressing
a
bill
final
conviction
that
the
american
people
taking
one
with
another
constitute
the
most
timorous
sniveling
poltroonish
ignominious
mob
of
serfs
and
ever
gathered
under
one
flag
in
christendom
since
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
and
that
they
grow
more
timorous
more
sniveling
more
poltroonish
more
ignominious
every
day
so
far
i
go
with
the
fugitive
young
intellectuals
and
into
the
bad
lands
beyond
such
in
brief
are
the
cardinal
articles
of
my
political
faith
held
passionately
since
my
admission
to
citizenship
and
now
growing
stronger
and
stronger
as
i
gradually
disintegrate
into
my
component
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
phosphorus
calcium
sodium
nitrogen
and
iron
this
is
what
i
believe
and
preach
nomine
domini
amen
yet
i
remain
on
the
dock
wrapped
in
the
flag
when
the
young
intellectuals
set
sail
yet
here
i
stand
unshaken
and
undespairing
a
loyal
and
devoted
americano
even
a
chauvinist
paying
taxes
without
complaint
obeying
all
laws
that
are
physiologically
obeyable
accepting
all
the
searching
duties
and
responsibilities
of
citizenship
unprotestingly
investing
the
sparse
usufructs
of
my
miserable
toil
in
the
obligations
of
the
nation
avoiding
all
commerce
with
men
sworn
to
overthrow
the
government
contributing
my
mite
toward
the
glory
of
the
national
arts
and
sciences
enriching
and
embellishing
the
native
language
spurning
all
lures
and
even
all
invitations
to
get
out
and
stay
out
here
am
i
a
bachelor
of
easy
means
years
old
unhampered
by
debts
or
issue
able
to
go
wherever
i
please
and
to
stay
as
long
as
i
please
here
am
i
contentedly
and
even
smugly
basking
beneath
the
stars
and
stripes
a
better
citizen
i
daresay
and
certainly
a
less
murmurous
and
exigent
one
than
thousands
who
put
the
hon
warren
gamaliel
harding
beside
friedrich
barbarossa
and
charlemagne
android
the
supreme
court
to
be
directly
inspired
by
the
holy
spirit
and
belong
ardently
to
every
rotary
club
ku
klux
klan
and
league
and
choke
with
emotion
when
the
band
plays
the
banner
and
believe
with
the
faith
of
little
children
that
one
of
our
boys
taken
at
random
could
dispose
in
a
fair
fight
of
ten
englishmen
twenty
germans
thirty
frogs
forty
wops
fifty
japs
or
a
hundred
bolsheviki
well
then
why
am
i
still
here
why
am
i
so
complacent
perhaps
even
to
the
point
of
offensiveness
so
free
from
bile
so
little
fretting
and
indignant
so
curiously
happy
why
did
i
answer
only
with
a
few
academic
hear
hears
when
henry
james
ezra
pound
harold
stearns
and
the
of
greenwich
village
issued
their
successive
calls
to
the
to
flee
the
shambles
escape
to
fairer
lands
throw
off
the
curse
forever
the
answer
of
course
is
to
be
sought
in
the
nature
of
happiness
which
tempts
to
metaphysics
but
let
me
keep
upon
the
ground
to
me
at
least
and
i
can
only
follow
my
own
nose
happiness
presents
itself
in
an
aspect
that
is
tripartite
to
be
happy
reducing
the
thing
to
its
elementals
i
must
be
unhounded
by
sordid
cares
at
ease
in
zion
full
of
a
comfortable
feeling
of
superiority
to
the
masses
of
my
delicately
and
unceasingly
amused
according
to
my
taste
it
is
my
contention
that
if
this
definition
be
accepted
there
is
no
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
wherein
a
man
roughly
constituted
as
i
am
a
man
of
my
general
weaknesses
vanities
appetites
prejudices
and
aversions
can
be
so
happy
or
even
so
happy
as
he
can
be
in
these
free
and
independent
states
going
further
i
lay
down
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
sheer
physical
impossibility
for
such
a
man
to
live
in
these
states
and
be
happy
that
it
is
as
impossible
to
him
as
it
would
be
to
a
schoolboy
to
weep
over
the
burning
down
of
his
if
he
says
that
he
is
happy
here
then
he
either
lies
or
is
insane
here
the
business
of
getting
a
living
particularly
since
the
war
brought
the
loot
of
all
europe
to
the
national
is
enormously
easier
than
it
is
in
any
other
christian
land
so
easy
in
fact
that
an
educated
and
forhanded
man
who
fails
at
it
must
actually
make
deliberate
efforts
to
that
end
here
the
general
average
of
intelligence
of
knowledge
of
competence
of
integrity
of
of
honor
is
so
low
that
any
man
who
knows
his
trade
does
not
fear
ghosts
has
read
fifty
good
books
and
practices
the
common
decencies
stands
out
as
brilliantly
as
a
wart
on
a
bald
head
and
is
thrown
into
a
meager
and
exclusive
aristocracy
and
here
more
than
anywhere
else
that
i
know
of
or
have
heard
of
the
daily
panorama
of
human
existence
of
private
and
communal
folly
the
unending
procession
of
governmental
extortions
and
chicaneries
of
commercial
brigandages
and
of
theological
buffooneries
of
æsthetic
ribaldries
of
legal
swindles
and
harlotries
of
miscellaneous
rogueries
villainies
imbecilities
grotesqueries
and
extravagances
is
so
inordinately
gross
and
preposterous
so
perfectly
brought
up
to
the
highest
conceivable
amperage
so
steadily
enriched
with
an
almost
fabulous
daring
and
originality
that
only
the
man
who
was
born
with
a
petrified
diaphragm
can
fail
to
laugh
himself
to
sleep
every
night
and
to
awake
every
morning
with
all
the
eager
unflagging
expectation
of
a
superintendent
touring
the
paris
a
certain
sough
rhetoric
may
be
here
perhaps
i
yield
to
words
as
a
chautauqua
lecturer
yields
to
them
belaboring
and
fermenting
the
hinds
with
his
message
from
the
new
jerusalem
but
fundamentally
i
am
quite
as
sincere
as
he
is
for
example
in
the
matter
of
attaining
to
ease
in
zion
of
getting
a
fair
share
of
the
national
swag
now
piled
so
mountainously
high
it
seems
to
me
sunk
in
my
egyptian
night
that
the
man
who
fails
to
do
this
in
the
united
states
is
a
man
who
is
somehow
stupid
not
on
the
surface
but
certainly
deep
down
either
he
is
one
who
cripples
himself
unduly
say
by
setting
up
a
family
before
he
can
care
for
it
or
by
making
a
bad
bargain
for
the
sale
of
his
wares
or
by
concerning
himself
too
much
about
the
affairs
of
other
men
or
he
is
one
who
endeavors
fatuously
to
sell
something
that
no
normal
american
wants
whenever
i
hear
a
professor
of
philosophy
complain
that
his
wife
has
eloped
with
some
actor
or
bootlegger
who
can
at
least
feed
and
clothe
her
my
natural
sympathy
for
the
man
is
greatly
corrupted
by
contempt
for
his
lack
of
sense
would
it
be
regarded
as
sane
and
laudable
for
a
man
to
travel
the
soudan
trying
to
sell
or
greenland
offering
to
teach
bookkeeping
or
counterpoint
coming
closer
would
the
judicious
pity
or
laugh
at
a
man
who
opened
a
shop
for
the
sale
of
incunabula
in
little
rock
or
who
demanded
a
living
in
mckeesport
on
the
ground
that
he
could
read
sumerian
in
precisely
the
same
way
it
seems
to
me
to
be
nonsensical
for
a
man
to
offer
generally
some
commodity
that
only
a
few
rare
and
dubious
americans
want
and
then
weep
and
beat
his
breast
because
he
is
not
patronized
one
seeking
to
make
a
living
in
a
country
must
pay
due
regard
to
the
needs
and
tastes
of
that
country
here
in
the
united
states
we
have
no
jobs
for
grand
dukes
and
none
for
geheimräte
and
none
for
palace
eunuchs
and
none
for
masters
of
the
and
none
any
more
for
brewery
and
very
few
for
metaphysicians
astrophysicists
assyriologists
stylites
and
epic
poets
there
was
a
time
when
the
served
a
public
need
and
got
an
adequate
reward
but
it
is
no
more
there
may
come
a
time
when
the
composer
of
string
quartettes
is
paid
as
much
as
a
railway
conductor
but
it
is
not
yet
then
why
practice
such
trades
that
is
as
trades
the
man
of
independent
means
may
venture
into
them
prudently
when
he
does
so
he
is
seldom
molested
it
may
even
be
argued
that
he
performs
a
public
service
by
adopting
them
but
the
man
who
has
a
living
to
make
is
simply
silly
if
he
goes
into
them
he
is
like
a
soldier
going
over
the
top
with
a
coffin
strapped
to
his
back
let
him
abandon
such
puerile
vanities
and
take
to
the
uplift
instead
as
indeed
thousands
of
other
victims
of
the
industrial
system
have
already
let
him
bear
in
mind
that
whatever
its
neglect
of
the
humanities
and
their
monks
the
republic
has
never
got
half
enough
bond
salesmen
quack
doctors
ward
leaders
phrenologists
methodist
evangelists
circus
clowns
magicians
soldiers
farmers
popular
song
writers
moonshine
distillers
forgers
of
gin
labels
mine
guard
detectives
spies
snoopers
and
the
rules
are
set
by
omnipotence
the
discreet
man
observes
them
observing
them
he
is
safe
beneath
the
starry
in
fair
weather
or
foul
the
is
a
bird
that
knows
no
closed
season
and
if
he
wo
come
down
to
texas
oil
stock
or
cancer
cures
or
building
lots
in
swampshurst
he
will
always
come
down
to
inspiration
and
optimism
whether
political
theological
pedagogical
literary
or
economic
the
doctrine
that
it
is
for
an
educated
man
to
take
a
hand
in
the
snaring
of
this
goose
is
one
in
which
i
see
nothing
convincing
it
is
a
doctrine
chiefly
voiced
i
believe
by
those
who
have
tried
the
business
and
failed
they
take
refuge
behind
the
childish
notion
that
there
is
something
honorable
about
poverty
the
greenwich
village
complex
this
is
nonsense
poverty
may
be
an
unescapable
misfortune
but
that
no
more
makes
it
honorable
than
a
cocked
eye
is
made
honorable
by
the
same
cause
do
i
advocate
then
the
ceaseless
senseless
hogging
of
money
i
do
not
all
i
advocate
and
praise
as
virtuous
is
the
hogging
of
enough
to
provide
security
and
ease
despite
all
the
romantic
superstitions
to
the
contrary
the
artist
can
not
do
his
best
work
when
he
is
oppressed
by
unsatisfied
wants
nor
can
the
philosopher
nor
can
the
man
of
science
the
best
and
clearest
thinking
of
the
world
is
done
and
the
finest
art
is
produced
not
by
men
who
are
hungry
ragged
and
harassed
but
by
men
who
are
warm
and
easy
in
mind
it
is
the
artist
first
duty
to
his
art
to
achieve
that
tranquility
for
himself
shakespeare
tried
to
achieve
it
so
did
beethoven
wagner
brahms
ibsen
and
balzac
goethe
schopenhauer
schumann
and
mendelssohn
were
born
to
it
joseph
conrad
richard
strauss
and
anatole
france
have
got
it
for
themselves
in
our
own
day
in
the
older
countries
where
competence
is
far
more
general
and
competition
is
thus
more
sharp
the
thing
is
often
cruelly
difficult
and
sometimes
almost
impossible
but
in
the
united
states
it
is
absurdly
easy
given
ordinary
luck
any
man
with
a
superior
air
the
intelligence
of
a
stockbroker
and
the
resolution
of
a
girl
in
brief
any
man
who
believes
in
himself
enough
and
with
sufficient
cause
to
be
called
a
journeyman
can
cadge
enough
money
in
this
glorious
commonwealth
of
morons
to
make
life
soft
for
him
and
if
a
lining
for
the
purse
is
thus
facilely
obtainable
given
a
reasonable
prudence
and
resourcefulness
then
balm
for
the
ego
is
just
as
unlaboriously
got
given
ordinary
dignity
and
decency
simply
to
exist
indeed
on
the
plane
of
a
civilized
man
is
to
attain
in
the
republic
to
a
distinction
that
should
be
enough
for
all
save
the
most
vain
it
is
even
likely
to
be
too
much
as
the
frequent
challenges
of
the
ku
klux
klan
the
american
legion
the
league
and
other
such
vigilance
committees
of
the
majority
testify
here
is
a
country
in
which
all
political
thought
and
activity
are
concentrated
upon
the
scramble
for
jobs
in
which
the
normal
politician
whether
he
be
a
president
or
a
village
road
supervisor
is
willing
to
renounce
any
principle
however
precious
to
him
and
to
adopt
any
lunacy
however
offensive
to
him
in
order
to
keep
his
place
at
the
trough
go
into
politics
then
without
seeking
or
wanting
office
and
at
once
you
are
as
conspicuous
as
a
blackamoor
in
fact
a
great
deal
more
conspicuous
for
blackamoors
have
been
seen
but
who
has
ever
seen
or
heard
of
an
american
politician
democrat
or
republican
socialist
or
liberal
whig
or
tory
who
did
not
itch
for
a
job
again
here
is
a
country
in
which
it
is
an
axiom
that
a
business
man
shall
be
a
member
of
a
chamber
of
commerce
an
admirer
of
charles
schwab
a
reader
of
the
evening
post
a
golfer
in
brief
a
vegetable
spend
your
hours
of
escape
from
reading
remy
de
gourmont
or
practicing
the
violoncello
and
the
local
sunday
newspaper
will
infallibly
find
you
out
and
hymn
the
marvel
nay
your
banker
will
summon
you
to
discuss
your
notes
and
your
rivals
will
spread
the
report
probably
truthful
that
you
were
during
the
war
yet
again
here
is
a
land
in
which
women
rule
and
men
are
slaves
train
your
women
to
get
your
slippers
for
you
and
your
ill
fame
will
match
galileo
or
darwin
once
more
here
is
the
paradise
of
of
democrats
of
mixers
of
maintain
ordinary
reserve
and
you

the

so

can
not

the
mysticism
of
the
mediæval
peasantry
gets
into
the
communal
view
of
them
and
they
begin
to
sprout
haloes
and
wings
as
i
say
no
intrinsic
merit
at

none
commensurate
with
the
mob
estimate
is
needed
to
come
to
such
august
dignities
everything

amateurish
and
childish

every

only
the

a
man
who
would
attract
little
attention
in
any
other
country
the
leading
american
critic
of
literature
after
twenty
years
of
diligent
exposition
of
his
ideas
has
yet
to
make
it
clear
what
he
is
in
favor
of
and
why
the
queen
of
the
monde
in
almost
every
american
city
is
a
woman
who
regards
lord
reading
as
an
aristocrat
and
her
superior
and
whose
grandfather
slept
in
his
underclothes
the
leading
american
musical
director
if
he

would

to

the

dead
with
no

erecting

epistemological
defense
for
the
national
æsthetic
maxim
i
do
know
nothing
about
music
but
i
know
what
i
like
the
most
eminent
statesman
the
united
states
has
produced
since
lincoln
was
fooled
by
arthur
james
balfour
and
miscalculated
his
public
support
by
more
than
votes
and
the
current
chief
magistrate
of
the
nation
its
defiant
substitute
for
czar
and
kaiser
is
a
printer
who
when
he
wishes
to
enjoy
himself
in
the
executive
mansion
invites
in
a
homeopathic
doctor
a
seventh
day
adventist
evangelist
and
a
couple
of
actresses
all
of
which
may
be
boiled
down
to
this
that
the
united
states
is
essentially
a
commonwealth
of
men
that
distinction
is
easy
here
because
the
general
level
of
culture
of
information
of
taste
and
judgment
of
ordinary
competence
is
so
low
no
sane
man
employing
an
american
plumber
to
repair
a
leaky
drain
would
expect
him
to
do
it
at
the
first
trial
and
in
precisely
the
same
way
no
sane
man
observing
an
american
secretary
of
state
in
negotiation
with
englishmen
and
japs
would
expect
him
to
come
off
better
than
second
best
men
of
course
exist
in
all
countries
but
it
is
only
here
that
they
are
in
full
control
of
the
state
and
with
it
of
all
the
national
standards
the
land
was
peopled
not
by
the
hardy
adventurers
of
legend
but
simply
by
incompetents
who
could
not
get
on
at
home
and
the
lavishness
of
nature
that
they
found
here
the
vast
ease
with
which
they
could
get
livings
confirmed
and
augmented
their
native
incompetence
no
american
colonist
even
in
the
worst
days
of
the
indian
wars
ever
had
to
face
such
hardships
as
ground
down
the
peasants
of
central
europe
during
the
hundred
years
war
nor
even
such
hardships
as
oppressed
the
english
lower
classes
during
the
century
before
the
reform
bill
of
in
most
of
the
colonies
indeed
he
seldom
saw
any
indians
at
all
the
one
thing
that
made
life
difficult
for
him
was
his
congenital
dunderheadedness
the
winning
of
the
west
so
rhetorically
celebrated
in
american
romance
cost
the
lives
of
fewer
men
than
the
single
battle
of
tannenberg
and
the
victory
was
much
easier
and
surer
the
immigrants
who
have
come
in
since
those
early
days
have
been
if
anything
of
even
lower
grade
than
their
forerunners
the
old
notion
that
the
united
states
is
peopled
by
the
offspring
of
brave
idealistic
and
liberty
loving
minorities
who
revolted
against
injustice
bigotry
and
mediævalism
at
home
this
notion
is
fast
succumbing
to
the
alarmed
study
that
has
been
given
of
late
to
the
immigration
of
recent
years
the
truth
is
that
the
majority
of
immigrants
since
the
revolution
like
the
majority
of
immigrants
before
the
revolution
have
been
not
the
superior
men
of
their
native
lands
but
the
botched
and
unfit
irishmen
starving
to
death
in
ireland
germans
unable
to
weather
the
und
of
the
reorganization
italians
on
exhausted
soil
scandinavians
run
to
all
bone
and
no
brain
jews
too
incompetent
to
swindle
even
the
barbarous
peasants
of
russia
poland
and
roumania
here
and
there
among
the
immigrants
of
course
there
may
be
a
bravo
or
even
a
superman
the
ancestors
of
volstead
ponzi
jack
dempsey
schwab
daugherty
debs
pershing
but
the
average
newcomer
is
and
always
has
been
simply
a
poor
fish
nor
is
there
much
soundness
in
the
common
assumption
so
beloved
of
professional
idealists
and
that
the
people
of
america
constitute
the
youngest
of
the
great
peoples
the
phrase
turns
up
endlessly
the
average
newspaper
editorial
writer
would
be
hamstrung
if
the
postoffice
suddenly
interdicted
it
as
it
interdicted
the
right
to
rebel
during
the
war
what
gives
it
a
certain
specious
plausibility
is
the
fact
that
the
american
republic
compared
to
a
few
other
existing
governments
is
relatively
young
but
the
american
republic
is
not
necessarily
identical
with
the
american
people
they
might
overturn
it
and
set
up
a
monarchy
and
still
remain
the
same
people
the
truth
is
that
as
a
distinct
nation
they
go
back
fully
three
hundred
years
and
that
even
their
government
is
older
than
that
of
most
other
nations
france
italy
germany
russia
moreover
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
there
is
anything
properly
describable
as
youthfulness
in
the
american
outlook
it
is
not
that
of
young
men
but
that
of
old
men
all
the
characteristics
of
senescence
are
in
it
a
great
distrust
of
ideas
an
habitual
timorousness
a
harsh
fidelity
to
a
few
fixed
beliefs
a
touch
of
mysticism
the
average
american
is
a
prude
and
a
methodist
under
his
skin
and
the
fact
is
never
more
evident
than
when
he
is
trying
to
disprove
it
his
vices
are
not
those
of
a
healthy
boy
but
those
of
an
ancient
paralytic
escaped
from
the
if
you
would
penetrate
to
the
causes
thereof
simply
go
down
to
ellis
island
and
look
at
the
next
shipload
of
immigrants
you
will
not
find
the
spring
of
youth
in
their
step
you
will
find
the
shuffling
of
exhausted
men
from
such
exhausted
men
the
american
stock
has
sprung
it
was
easier
for
them
to
survive
here
than
it
was
where
they
came
from
but
that
ease
though
it
made
them
feel
stronger
did
not
actually
strengthen
them
it
left
them
what
they
were
when
they
came
weary
peasants
eager
only
for
the
comfortable
security
of
a
pig
in
a
sty
out
of
that
eagerness
has
issued
many
of
the
noblest
manifestations
of
american
the
national
hatred
of
war
the
pervasive
suspicion
of
the
aims
and
intents
of
all
other
nations
the
short
way
with
heretics
and
disturbers
of
the
peace
the
unshakable
belief
in
devils
the
implacable
hostility
to
every
novel
idea
and
point
of
view
all
these
ways
of
thinking
are
the
marks
of
the
peasant
more
of
the
peasant
long
ground
into
the
mud
of
his
wallow
and
determined
at
last
to
stay
there
the
peasant
who
has
definitely
renounced
any
lewd
desire
he
may
have
ever
had
to
gape
at
the
stars
the
habits
of
mind
of
this
dull
sempiternal
the
oldest
man
in
christendom
are
with
a
few
modifications
the
habits
of
mind
of
the
american
people
the
peasant
has
a
great
practical
cunning
but
he
is
unable
to
see
any
further
than
the
next
farm
he
likes
money
and
knows
how
to
amass
property
but
his
cultural
development
is
but
little
above
that
of
the
domestic
animals
he
is
intensely
and
cocksurely
moral
but
his
morality
and
his
are
crudely
identical
he
is
emotional
and
easy
to
scare
but
his
imagination
can
not
grasp
an
abstraction
he
is
a
violent
nationalist
and
patriot
but
he
admires
rogues
in
office
and
always
beats
the
if
he
can
he
has
immovable
opinions
about
all
the
great
affairs
of
state
but
of
them
are
sheer
imbecilities
he
is
violently
jealous
of
what
he
conceives
to
be
his
rights
but
brutally
disregardful
of
the
other
fellow
he
is
religious
but
his
religion
is
wholly
devoid
of
beauty
and
dignity
this
man
whether
city
or
country
bred
is
the
normal
americano
the
per
cent
methodist
odd
fellow
ku
kluxer
and
know
nothing
he
exists
in
all
countries
but
here
alone
he
rules
here
alone
his
anthropoid
fears
and
rages
are
accepted
gravely
as
logical
ideas
and
dissent
from
them
is
punished
as
a
sort
of
public
offense
around
every
one
of
his
principal
delusions
of
the
sacredness
of
democracy
of
the
feasibility
of
sumptuary
law
of
the
incurable
sinfulness
of
all
other
peoples
of
the
menace
of
ideas
of
the
corruption
lying
in
all
the
arts
there
is
thrown
a
barrier
of
taboos
and
woe
to
the
anarchist
who
seeks
to
break
it
down
the
multiplication
of
such
taboos
is
obviously
not
characteristic
of
a
culture
that
is
moving
from
a
lower
plane
to
a
higher
that
is
of
a
culture
still
in
the
full
glow
of
its
youth
it
is
a
sign
rather
of
a
culture
that
is
slipping
downhill
one
that
is
reverting
to
the
most
primitive
standards
and
ways
of
thought
the
taboo
indeed
is
the
of
the
savage
and
wherever
it
exists
it
is
a
relentless
and
effective
enemy
of
civilized
enlightenment
the
savage
is
the
most
meticulously
moral
of
men
there
is
scarcely
an
act
of
his
daily
life
that
is
not
conditioned
by
unyielding
prohibitions
and
obligations
most
of
them
logically
unintelligible
the
a
savage
set
amid
civilization
cherishes
a
code
of
the
same
draconian
kind
he
believes
firmly
that
right
and
wrong
are
immovable
things
that
they
have
an
actual
and
unchangeable
existence
and
that
any
challenge
of
them
by
word
or
act
is
a
crime
against
society
and
with
the
concept
of
wrongness
of
course
he
always
confuses
the
concept
of
mere
differentness
to
him
the
two
are
indistinguishable
anything
strange
is
to
be
combatted
it
is
of
the
devil
the
can
not
grasp
ideas
in
their
native
nakedness
they
must
be
dramatized
and
personalized
for
him
and
provided
with
either
white
wings
or
forked
tails
all
discussion
of
them
to
interest
him
must
take
the
form
of
a
pursuit
and
scotching
of
demons
he
can
not
think
of
a
heresy
without
thinking
of
a
heretic
to
be
caught
condemned
and
burned
the
fathers
of
the
republic
i
am
convinced
had
a
great
deal
more
prevision
than
even
their
most
romantic
worshipers
give
them
credit
for
they
not
only
sought
to
create
a
governmental
machine
that
would
be
safe
from
attack
without
they
also
sought
to
create
one
that
would
be
safe
from
attack
within
they
invented
very
ingenious
devices
for
holding
the
mob
in
check
for
protecting
the
national
polity
against
its
transient
and
illogical
rages
for
securing
the
determination
of
all
the
larger
matters
of
state
to
a
concealed
but
none
the
less
real
aristocracy
nothing
could
have
been
further
from
the
intent
of
washington
hamilton
and
even
jefferson
than
that
the
official
doctrines
of
the
nation
in
the
year
should
be
identical
with
the
nonsense
heard
in
the
chautauqua
from
the
evangelical
pulpit
and
on
the
stump
but
jackson
and
his
merry
men
broke
through
the
barbed
wires
thus
so
carefully
strung
and
ever
since
has
been
the
true
voice
of
the
nation
there
is
no
longer
any
question
of
statesmanship
in
any
real
sense
in
our
politics
the
only
way
to
success
in
american
public
life
lies
in
flattering
and
kowtowing
to
the
mob
a
candidate
for
office
even
the
highest
must
either
adopt
its
current
manias
bloc
or
convince
it
hypocritically
that
he
has
done
so
while
cherishing
reservations
the
result
is
that
only
two
sorts
of
men
stand
any
chance
whatever
of
getting
into
actual
control
of
affairs
first
glorified
who
genuinely
believe
what
the
mob
believes
and
secondly
shrewd
fellows
who
are
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
of
conviction
and
in
order
to
hold
their
jobs
one
finds
perfect
examples
of
the
first
class
in
jackson
and
bryan
one
finds
hundreds
of
specimens
of
the
second
among
the
politicians
who
got
themselves
so
affectingly
converted
to
prohibition
and
who
voted
and
blubbered
for
it
with
flasks
in
their
pockets
even
on
the
highest
planes
our
politics
seems
to
be
incurable
mountebankish
the
same
senators
who
raised
such
raucous
alarms
against
the
league
of
nations
voted
for
the
disarmament
treaty
a
far
more
obvious
surrender
to
english
hegemony
and
the
same
senators
who
pleaded
for
the
league
on
the
ground
that
its
failure
would
break
the
heart
of
the
world
were
eloquently
against
the
treaty
the
few
men
who
maintained
a
consistent
course
in
both
cases
voting
either
for
or
against
both
league
and
treaty
were
denounced
by
the
newspapers
as
deliberate
marplots
and
found
their
constituents
rising
against
them
to
such
an
extent
had
the
public
become
accustomed
to
buncombe
that
simple
honesty
was
incomprehensible
to
it
and
hence
abhorrent
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
a
previous
work
this
dominance
of
mob
ways
of
thinking
this
pollution
of
the
whole
intellectual
life
of
the
country
by
the
prejudices
and
emotions
of
the
rabble
goes
unchallenged
because
the
old
landed
aristocracy
of
the
colonial
era
has
been
engulfed
and
almost
obliterated
by
the
rise
of
the
industrial
system
and
no
new
aristocracy
has
arisen
to
take
its
place
and
discharge
its
highly
necessary
functions
an
upper
class
of
course
exists
and
of
late
it
has
tended
to
increase
in
power
but
it
is
culturally
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
mob
it
lacks
absolutely
anything
even
remotely
resembling
an
aristocratic
point
of
view
one
searches
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
the
true
spirit
in
the
vanderbilts
astors
morgans
garys
and
other
such
earls
and
dukes
of
the
plutocracy
their
culture
like
their
aspiration
remains
that
of
the
pawnshop
one
searches
in
vain
too
for
the
aloof
air
of
the
don
in
the
official
of
the
american
universities
they
are
timorous
and
orthodox
and
constitute
a
reptile
congregatio
de
propaganda
fide
to
match
bismarck
everywhere
else
on
earth
despite
the
rise
of
democracy
an
organized
minority
of
aristocrats
survives
from
a
more
spacious
day
and
if
its
personnel
has
degenerated
and
its
legal
powers
have
decayed
it
has
at
least
maintained
some
vestige
of
its
old
independence
of
spirit
and
jealously
guarded
its
old
right
to
be
heard
without
risk
of
penalty
even
in
england
where
the
peerage
has
been
debauched
to
the
level
of
a
political
baptismal
fount
for
jewish
and
wesleyan
there
is
sanctuary
for
the
old
order
in
the
two
ancient
universities
and
a
lingering
respect
for
it
in
the
peasantry
but
in
the
united
states
it
was
paralyzed
by
jackson
and
got
its
death
blow
from
grant
and
since
then
no
successor
to
it
has
been
evolved
thus
there
is
no
organized
force
to
oppose
the
irrational
vagaries
of
the
mob
the
legislative
and
executive
arms
of
the
government
yield
to
them
without
resistance
the
judicial
arm
has
begun
to
yield
almost
as
supinely
particularly
when
they
take
the
form
of
outside
the
official
circle
there
is
no
opposition
that
is
even
dependably
articulate
the
worst
excesses
go
almost
without
challenge
discussion
when
it
is
heard
at
all
is
feeble
and
superficial
and
girt
about
by
the
taboos
that
i
have
mentioned
the
clatter
about
the
ku
klux
klan
two
or
three
years
ago
was
typical
the
astounding
program
of
this
organization
was
discussed
in
the
newspapers
for
months
on
end
and
a
committee
of
congress
sat
in
solemn
state
to
investigate
it
and
yet
not
a
single
newspaper
or
congressman
so
far
as
i
am
aware
so
much
as
mentioned
the
most
patent
and
important
fact
about
it
to
wit
that
the
ku
klux
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
simply
the
secular
arm
of
the
methodist
church
and
that
its
methods
were
no
more
than
physical
projections
of
the
familiar
extravagances
of
the
league
the
intimate
relations
between
church
and
klan
amounting
almost
to
identity
must
have
been
plain
to
every
intelligent
american
and
yet
the
taboo
upon
the
realistic
consideration
of
ecclesiastical
matters
was
sufficient
to
make
every
public
soothsayer
disregard
it
completely
i
often
wonder
indeed
if
there
would
be
any
intellectual
life
at
all
in
the
united
states
if
it
were
not
for
the
steady
importation
in
bulk
of
ideas
from
abroad
and
particularly
in
late
years
from
england
what
would
become
of
the
average
american
scholar
if
he
could
not
borrow
wholesale
from
english
scholars
how
could
an
inquisitive
youth
get
beneath
the
surface
of
our
politics
if
it
were
not
for
such
anatomists
as
bryce
who
would
show
our
statesmen
the
dotted
lines
for
their
signatures
if
there
were
no
balfours
and
how
could
our
young
professors
formulate
æsthetic
judgments
especially
in
the
field
of
letters
if
it
were
not
for
such
gifted
english
mentors
as
robertson
nicoll
squire
and
by
what
process
finally
would
the
true
style
of
a
visiting
card
be
determined
and
the
manner
of
eating
artichokes
if
there
were
no
reports
from
mayfair
on
certain
levels
this
naïve
subservience
must
needs
irritate
every
american
and
even
dismay
him
when
he
recalls
the
amazing
feats
of
the
english
war
propagandists
between
and
and
their
even
more
amazing
confessions
of
method
since
he
is
apt
to
ask
himself
quite
gravely
if
he
belongs
to
a
free
nation
or
to
a
crown
colony
the
thing
was
done
openly
shamelessly
contemptuously
cynically
and
yet
it
was
a
gigantic
success
the
office
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
from
the
end
of
grotesque
incumbency
to
the
end
of
the
wilson
administration
was
little
more
than
an
antechamber
of
the
british
foreign
office
wilson
himself
in
the
conduct
of
his
policy
differed
only
legally
from
such
colonial
premiers
as
hughes
and
smuts
even
after
the
united
states
got
into
the
war
it
was
more
swagger
for
a
young
american
blood
to
wear
the
british
uniform
than
the
american
uniform
no
american
ever
seriously
questions
an
englishman
or
englishwoman
of
official
or
even
merely
fashionable
position
at
home
lord
birkenhead
was
accepted
as
a
gentleman
everywhere
in
the
united
states
asquith
almost
unbelievable
imbecilities
were
heard
with
hushed
fascination
even
lady
astor
an
american
married
to
an
expatriate
turned
english
viscount
was
greeted
with
solemn
effusiveness
during
the
latter
part
of
when
new
york
swarmed
with
british
military
missions
i
observed
in
a
polite
protest
against
a
very
significant
habit
of
certain
of
their
gallant
members
that
of
going
to
dances
wearing
spurs
and
so
macerating
the
frocks
and
heels
of
the
fawning
fair
the
protest
it
appears
was
not
voiced
by
the
hosts
and
hostesses
of
these
singular
officers
they
would
have
welcomed
their
guests
in
trench
boots
it
was
left
to
a
dubious
weekly
and
it
was
made
very
gingerly
the
spectacle
as
i
say
has
a
way
of
irking
the
american
touched
by
nationalistic
weakness
ever
since
the
day
of
lowell
even
since
the
day
of
cooper
and
irving
there
have
been
denunciations
of
it
but
however
unpleasant
it
may
be
there
is
no
denying
that
a
chain
of
logical
causes
lies
behind
it
and
that
they
are
not
to
be
disposed
of
by
objecting
to
them
the
average
american
of
the
majority
in
truth
is
simply
a
englishman
and
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
is
spontaneously
servile
despite
all
his
democratic
denial
of
superiorities
to
what
he
conceives
to
be
englishmen
he
corresponds
roughly
to
an
english
nonconformist
of
the
variety
and
he
shows
all
the
familiar
characters
of
the
breed
he
is
truculent
and
cocksure
and
yet
he
knows
how
to
take
off
his
hat
when
a
bishop
of
the
establishment
passes
he
is
hot
against
the
dukes
and
yet
the
notice
of
a
concrete
duke
is
a
singing
in
his
heart
it
seems
to
me
that
this
inferior
is
losing
his
old
dominance
in
the
united
states
that
is
biologically
but
he
will
keep
his
cultural
primacy
for
a
long
long
while
in
spite
of
the
overwhelming
inrush
of
men
of
other
races
if
only
because
those
newcomers
are
even
more
clearly
inferior
than
he
is
of
the
italians
for
example
who
have
come
to
these
shores
in
late
years
have
brought
no
more
of
the
essential
culture
of
italy
with
them
than
so
many
horned
cattle
would
have
brought
if
they
become
civilized
at
all
settling
here
it
is
the
civilization
of
the
majority
that
they
acquire
which
is
to
say
the
civilization
of
the
english
second
table
so
with
the
germans
the
scandinavians
and
even
the
jews
and
irish
the
germans
taking
one
with
another
are
on
the
cultural
level
of
i
have
come
into
contact
with
a
great
many
of
them
since
some
of
them
of
considerable
wealth
and
even
of
fashionable
pretensions
in
the
whole
lot
i
can
think
of
but
a
score
or
two
who
could
name
offhand
the
principal
works
of
thomas
mann
otto
julius
bierbaum
ludwig
thoma
or
hugo
von
hofmannsthal
they
know
much
more
about
mutt
and
jeff
than
they
know
about
goethe
the
scandinavians
are
even
worse
the
majority
of
them
are
mere
clods
and
they
are
sucked
into
the
knights
of
pythias
the
chautauqua
and
the
methodist
church
almost
as
soon
as
they
land
it
is
by
no
means
a
mere
accident
that
the
national
prohibition
enforcement
act
bears
the
name
of
a
man
theoretically
of
the
blood
of
gustavus
vasa
svend
of
the
forked
beard
and
eric
the
red
the
irish
in
the
united
states
are
scarcely
touched
by
the
revival
of
irish
culture
despite
their
melodramatic
concern
with
irish
politics
during
the
war
they
supplied
diligent
and
dependable
agents
to
the
white
terror
and
at
all
times
they
are
very
susceptible
to
political
and
social
bribery
as
for
the
jews
they
change
their
names
to
burton
thompson
and
cecil
in
order
to
qualify
as
true
americans
and
when
they
are
accepted
and
rewarded
in
the
national
coin
they
renounce
moses
altogether
and
get
themselves
baptized
in
bartholomew
church
whenever
ideas
enter
the
united
states
from
without
they
come
by
way
of
england
what
the
london
says
about
ukranian
politics
the
revolt
in
india
a
change
of
ministry
in
italy
the
character
of
the
king
of
norway
the
oil
situation
in
mesopotamia
will
be
said
week
after
next
by
the
of
new
york
and
a
month
or
two
later
by
all
the
other
american
newspapers
the
extent
of
this
control
of
american
opinion
by
english
news
mongers
is
but
little
appreciated
in
the
united
states
even
by
professional
journalists
fully
of
all
the
foreign
news
that
comes
to
the
american
newspapers
comes
through
london
and
most
of
the
rest
is
supplied
either
by
englishmen
or
by
jews
often
who
maintain
close
relations
with
the
english
during
the
years
so
many
english
agents
got
into
germany
in
the
guise
of
american
correspondents
sometimes
with
the
full
knowledge
of
their
anglomaniac
american
employers
that
the
germans
just
before
the
united
states
entered
the
war
were
considering
barring
american
correspondents
from
their
country
altogether
i
was
in
copenhagen
and
basel
in
and
found
both
towns
each
an
important
source
of
war
news
full
of
jews
representing
american
journals
as
a
to
more
delicate
and
confidential
work
for
the
english
department
of
press
propaganda
even
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
the
american
correspondents
in
europe
are
strongly
under
english
influences
and
in
the
far
east
the
proportion
is
probably
still
larger
but
these
men
seldom
handle
really
important
news
all
that
is
handled
from
london
and
by
trustworthy
britons
such
of
it
as
is
not
cabled
directly
to
the
american
newspapers
and
press
associations
is
later
clipped
from
english
newspapers
and
printed
as
bogus
letters
or
cablegrams
the
american
papers
accept
such
very
dubious
stuff
not
chiefly
because
they
are
hopelessly
stupid
or
anglomaniac
but
because
they
find
it
impossible
to
engage
competent
american
correspondents
if
the
native
journalists
who
discuss
our
domestic
politics
avoid
the
fundamentals
timorously
then
those
who
venture
to
discuss
foreign
politics
are
scarcely
aware
of
the
fundamentals
at
all
we
have
simply
developed
no
class
of
experts
in
such
matters
no
man
comparable
say
to
dillon
wickham
steed
count
zu
reventlow
or
wilfrid
scawen
blunt
exists
in
the
united
states
when
in
the
summer
of
the
editors
of
the
baltimore
undertook
plans
to
cover
the
approaching
disarmament
conference
at
washington
in
a
comprehensive
and
intelligent
manner
they
were
forced
into
employing
englishmen
to
do
the
work
such
men
as
brailsford
and
bywater
writing
from
london
three
thousand
miles
away
were
actually
better
able
to
interpret
the
work
of
the
conference
than
american
correspondents
on
the
spot
few
of
whom
were
capable
of
anything
beyond
the
most
trivial
gossip
during
the
whole
period
of
the
conference
not
a
professional
washington
correspondent
the
flower
of
american
political
journalism
wrote
a
single
article
upon
the
proceedings
that
got
further
than
their
surface
aspects
before
the
end
of
the
sessions
this
enforced
dependence
upon
english
opinion
had
an
unexpected
and
significant
result
facing
the
english
and
the
japs
in
an
unyielding
alliance
the
french
turned
to
the
american
delegation
for
assistance
the
issue
specifically
before
the
conference
was
one
on
which
american
was
obviously
identical
with
french
nevertheless
the
english
had
such
firm
grip
upon
the
machinery
of
news
distribution
that
they
were
able
in
less
than
a
week
to
turn
american
public
opinion
against
the
french
and
even
to
set
up
an
active
francophobia
no
american
not
even
any
of
the
american
delegates
was
able
to
cope
with
their
propaganda
they
not
only
dominated
the
conference
and
pushed
through
a
set
of
treaties
that
were
extravagantly
favorable
to
england
they
even
established
the
doctrine
that
all
opposition
to
those
treaties
was
immoral
when
continental
ideas
whether
in
politics
in
metaphysics
or
in
the
fine
arts
penetrate
to
the
united
states
they
nearly
always
travel
by
way
of
england
emerson
did
not
read
goethe
he
read
carlyle
the
american
people
from
the
end
of
to
the
end
of
did
not
read
statements
of
the
german
case
they
read
english
interpretations
of
those
statements
in
london
is
the
clearing
house
and
transformer
station
there
the
latest
notions
from
the
mainland
are
sifted
out
carefully
diluted
with
english
water
and
put
into
neat
packages
for
the
yankee
trade
the
english
not
only
get
a
chance
to
ameliorate
or
embellish
they
also
determine
very
largely
what
ideas
americans
are
to
hear
of
at
all
whatever
fails
to
interest
them
or
is
in
any
way
obnoxious
to
them
is
not
likely
to
cross
the
ocean
this
explains
why
it
is
that
most
literate
americans
are
so
densely
ignorant
of
many
continentals
who
have
been
celebrated
at
home
for
years
for
example
huysmans
hartleben
vaibinger
merezhkovsky
keyserling
snoilsky
mauthner
altenberg
heidenstam
alfred
kerr
it
also
explains
why
they
so
grossly
overestimate
various
laughed
at
at
home
for
example
brieux
these
fellows
simply
happen
to
interest
the
english
and
are
thus
palmed
off
upon
the
gaping
colonists
of
yankeedom
in
the
case
of
brieux
the
was
achieved
by
one
man
george
bernard
shaw
a
scotch
disguised
as
an
irish
patriot
and
english
soothsayer
shaw
at
bottom
has
the
ideas
of
a
presbyterian
elder
and
so
the
moral
frenzy
of
brieux
enchanted
him
whereupon
he
retired
to
his
chamber
wrote
a
flaming
brieuxiad
for
the
american
trade
and
founded
the
late
vogue
of
the
french
sylvanus
stall
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
this
wholesale
import
and
export
business
in
continental
fancies
is
of
no
little
benefit
of
course
to
the
generality
of
americans
if
it
did
not
exist
they
would
probably
never
hear
of
many
of
the
salient
continentals
at
all
for
the
obvious
incompetence
of
most
of
the
native
and
resident
introducers
of
intellectual
ambassadors
makes
them
suspicious
even
of
those
who
like
boyd
and
nathan
are
thoroughly
competent
to
this
day
there
is
no
american
translation
of
the
plays
of
ibsen
we
use
the
william
archer
translations
most
of
them
atrociously
bad
but
still
better
than
nothing
so
with
the
works
of
nietzsche
anatole
france
georg
brandes
turgeniev
dostoyevsky
tolstoi
and
other
moderns
after
their
kind
i
can
think
of
but
one
important
exception
the
work
of
gerhart
hauptmann
done
into
english
by
and
under
the
supervision
of
ludwig
lewisohn
but
even
here
lewisohn
used
a
number
of
english
translations
of
single
plays
the
english
were
still
ahead
of
him
though
they
stopped
half
way
he
is
in
any
case
a
very
extraordinary
american
and
the
department
of
justice
kept
an
eye
on
him
during
the
war
the
average
american
professor
is
far
too
dull
a
fellow
to
undertake
so
difficult
an
enterprise
even
when
he
sports
a
german
one
usually
finds
on
examination
that
all
he
knows
about
modern
german
literature
is
that
a
of
hofbräu
in
munich
used
to
cost
downstairs
and
upstairs
the
german
universities
were
formerly
very
tolerant
of
foreigners
many
an
american
in
preparation
for
professing
at
harvard
spent
a
couple
of
years
roaming
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
without
picking
up
enough
german
to
read
the
such
frauds
swarm
in
all
our
lesser
universities
and
many
of
them
during
the
war
became
eminent
authorities
upon
the
crimes
of
nietzsche
and
the
errors
of
treitschke
in
rainy
weather
when
my
old
wounds
ache
and
the
four
humors
do
battle
in
my
spleen
i
often
find
myself
speculating
sourly
as
to
the
future
of
the
republic
native
opinion
of
course
is
to
the
effect
that
it
will
be
secure
and
glorious
the
superstition
that
progress
must
always
be
upward
and
onward
will
not
down
in
virulence
and
popularity
it
matches
the
superstition
that
money
can
accomplish
anything
but
this
view
is
not
shared
by
most
reflective
foreigners
as
any
one
may
find
out
by
looking
into
such
a
book
as

the
american

as
nations
go
has
led
a
safe
and
easy
life
with
no
serious
enemies
to
menace
it
either
within
or
without
and
no
grim
struggle
with
want
getting
a
living
here
has
always
been
easier
than
anywhere
else
in
christendom
getting
a
secure
foothold
has
been
possible
to
whole
classes
of
men
who
would
have
remained
submerged
in
europe
as
the
character
of
our
plutocracy
and
no
less
of
our
so
brilliantly
shows
the
american
people
have
never
had
to
face
such
titanic
assaults
as
those
suffered
by
the
people
of
holland
poland
and
half
a
dozen
other
little
countries
they
have
not
lived
with
a
ring
of
powerful
and
unconscionable
enemies
about
them
as
the
germans
have
lived
since
the
middle
ages
they
have
not
been
torn
by
class
wars
as
the
french
the
spaniards
and
the
russians
have
been
torn
they
have
not
thrown
their
strength
into
and
exhausting
colonial
enterprises
like
the
english
all
their
foreign
wars
have
been
fought
with
foes
either
too
weak
to
resist
them
or
too
heavily
engaged
elsewhere
to
make
more
than
a
attempt
the
combats
with
mexico
and
spain
were
not
wars
they
were
simply
lynchings
even
the
civil
war
compared
to
the
larger
european
conflicts
since
the
invention
of
gunpowder
was
trivial
in
its
character
and
transient
in
its
effects
the
population
of
the
united
states
when
it
began
was
about
say
per
cent
under
the
population
of
france
in
but
after
four
years
of
struggle
the
number
of
men
killed
in
action
or
dead
of
wounds
in
the
two
armies
came
but
probably
little
more
than
a
sixth
of
the
total
losses
of
france
between
and
nor
was
there
any
very
extensive
destruction
of
property
in
all
save
a
small
area
in
the
north
there
was
none
at
all
and
even
in
the
south
only
a
few
towns
of
any
importance
were
destroyed
the
average
northerner
passed
through
the
four
years
scarcely
aware
save
by
report
that
a
war
was
going
on
in
the
south
the
breath
of
mars
blew
more
hotly
but
even
there
large
numbers
of
men
escaped
service
and
the
general
hardship
everywhere
fell
a
great
deal
short
of
the
hardships
suffered
by
the
belgians
the
french
of
the
north
the
germans
of
east
prussia
and
the
serbians
and
rumanians
in
the
world
war
the
agonies
of
the
south
have
been
much
exaggerated
in
popular
romance
they
were
probably
more
severe
during
reconstruction
when
they
were
chiefly
psychical
than
they
were
during
the
actual
war
certainly
general
robert
lee
was
in
a
favorable
position
to
estimate
the
military
achievement
of
the
confederacy
well
lee
was
of
the
opinion
that
his
army
was
very
badly
supported
by
the
civil
population
and
that
its
final
disaster
was
largely
due
to
that
ineffective
support
coming
down
to
the
time
of
the
world
war
one
finds
precious
few
signs
that
the
american
people
facing
an
antagonist
of
equal
strength
and
with
both
hands
free
could
be
relied
upon
to
give
a
creditable
account
of
themselves
the
american
share
in
that
great
struggle
in
fact
was
marked
by
poltroonery
almost
as
conspicuously
as
it
was
marked
by
knavery
let
us
consider
briefly
what
the
nation
did
for
a
few
months
it
viewed
the
struggle
idly
and
unintelligently
as
a
yokel
might
stare
at
a
at
a
county
fair
then
seeing
a
chance
to
profit
it
undertook
with
sudden
alacrity
the
ghoulish
office
of
one
of
the
contestants
being
debarred
by
the
chances
of
war
from
buying
it
devoted
its
whole
energies
for
two
years
to
purveying
to
the
other
meanwhile
it
made
every
effort
to
aid
its
customer
by
lending
him
the
cloak
of
its
neutrality
that
is
by
demanding
all
the
privileges
of
a
neutral
and
yet
carrying
on
a
stupendous
wholesale
effort
to
promote
the
war
on
the
official
side
this
neutrality
was
fraudulent
from
the
start
as
the
revelations
of
tumulty
have
since
demonstrated
popularly
it
became
more
and
more
fraudulent
as
the
debts
of
the
customer
contestant
piled
up
and
it
became
more
and
more
apparent
a
fact
diligently
made
known
by
his
partisans
that
they
would
be
worthless
if
he
failed
to
win
then
in
the
end
covert
aid
was
transformed
into
overt
aid
and
under
what
gallant
conditions
in
brief
there
stood
a
nation
of
people
which
without
effective
allies
had
just
closed
two
and
a
half
years
of
homeric
conflict
by
completely
defeating
an
enemy
state
of
and
two
lesser
ones
of
more
than
together
and
now
stood
at
bay
before
a
combination
of
at
least
upon
this
and
foe
the
republic
of
freemen
now
flung
itself
so
lifting
the
odds
to
to
and
after
a
year
and
a
half
more
of
struggle
it
emerged
triumphant
a
knightly
victor
surely
there
is
no
need
to
rehearse
the
astounding
and
unprecedented
swinishness
that
accompanied
this
glorious
business
the
colossal
waste
of
public
money
the
savage
persecution
of
all
opponents
and
critics
of
the
war
the
open
bribery
of
labor
the
reviling
of
the
enemy
the
manufacture
of
false
news
the
knavish
robbery
of
enemy
civilians
the
incessant
spy
hunts
the
floating
of
public
loans
by
a
process
of
blackmail
the
degradation
of
the
red
cross
to
partisan
uses
the
complete
abandonment
of
all
decency
decorum
and
the
facts
must
be
remembered
with
shame
by
every
civilized
american
lest
they
be
forgotten
by
the
generations
of
the
future
i
am
even
now
engaged
with
collaborators
upon
an
exhaustive
record
of
them
in
twenty
volumes
folio
more
important
to
the
present
purpose
are
two
things
that
are
apt
to
be
overlooked
the
first
of
which
is
the
capital
fact
that
the
war
was
sold
to
the
american
people
as
the
phrase
has
it
not
by
appealing
to
their
courage
but
by
appealing
to
their
cowardice
in
brief
by
adopting
the
assumption
that
they
were
not
warlike
at
all
and
certainly
not
gallant
and
chivalrous
but
merely
craven
and
fearful
the
first
selling
point
of
the
proponents
of
american
participation
was
the
contention
that
the
germans
with
gigantic
wars
still
raging
on
both
fronts
were
preparing
to
invade
the
united
states
burn
down
all
the
towns
murder
all
the
men
and
carry
off
all
the
women
that
their
victory
would
bring
staggering
and
irresistible
reprisals
for
the
american
violation
of
the
duties
of
a
neutral
the
second
selling
point
was
that
the
entrance
of
the
united
states
would
end
the
war
almost
instantly
that
the
germans
would
be
so
overwhelmingly
in
men
and
guns
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
make
any
effective
defense
above
all
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
inflict
any
serious
damage
upon
their
new
foes
neither
argument
it
must
be
plain
showed
the
slightest
belief
in
the
warlike
skill
and
courage
of
the
american
people
both
were
grounded
upon
the
frank
theory
that
the
only
way
to
make
the
mob
fight
was
to
scare
it
half
to
death
and
then
show
it
a
way
to
fight
without
risk
to
stab
a
helpless
antagonist
in
the
back
and
both
were
mellowed
and
reënforced
by
the
hint
that
such
a
noble
assault
beside
being
safe
would
also
be
extremely
profitable
that
it
would
convert
very
dubious
debts
into
very
good
debts
and
dispose
forever
of
a
diligent
and
dangerous
competitor
for
trade
especially
in
latin
america
all
the
idealist
nonsense
emitted
by
wilson
and
company
was
simply
icing
on
the
cake
most
of
it
was
abandoned
as
soon
as
the
bullets
began
to
fly
and
the
rest
consisted
simply
of
meaningless
words
the
idiotic
babbling
of
a
presbyterian
evangelist
turned
prophet
and
seer
the
other
thing
that
needs
to
be
remembered
is
the
permanent
effect
of
so
dishonest
and
cowardly
a
business
upon
the
national
character
already
far
too
much
inclined
toward
easy
ventures
and
long
odds
somewhere
in
his
diaries
wilfrid
scawen
blunt
speaks
of
the
marked
debasement
that
showed
itself
in
the
english
spirit
after
the
brutal
robbery
and
assassination
of
the
south
african
republics
the
heroes
that
the
mob
followed
after
mafeking
day
were
far
inferior
to
the
heroes
that
it
had
followed
in
the
days
before
the
war
the
english
gentleman
began
to
disappear
from
public
life
and
in
his
place
appeared
a
bounder
obviously
almost
identical
with
the
american
professional
politician
the
chamberlain
smith
churchill
bottomley
northcliffe
type
worse
old
ideals
went
with
old
heroes
personal
freedom
and
strict
legality
says
blunt
vanished
from
the
english
tables
of
the
law
and
there
was
a
shift
of
the
social
and
political
center
of
gravity
to
a
lower
plane
precisely
the
same
effect
is
now
visible
in
the
united
states
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conscripts
went
into
the
army
unwillingly
and
once
there
they
were
debauched
by
the
twin
forces
of
the
official
propaganda
that
i
have
mentioned
and
a
harsh
unintelligent
discipline
the
first
made
them
almost
incapable
of
soldierly
thought
and
conduct
the
second
converted
them
into
cringing
the
consequences
display
themselves
in
the
amazing
activities
of
the
american
legion
and
in
the
rise
of
such
correlative
organizations
as
the
ku
klux
klan
it
is
impossible
to
fit
any
reasonable
concept
of
the
soldierly
into
the
familiar
proceedings
of
the
legion
its
members
conduct
themselves
like
a
gang
of
methodist
on
the
loose
or
a
southern
lynching
party
they
are
forever
discovering
preposterous
burglars
under
the
national
bed
and
they
advance
to
the
attack
not
gallantly
and
at
fair
odds
but
cravenly
and
in
overwhelming
force
some
of
their
enterprises
to
be
set
forth
at
length
in
the
record
i
have
mentioned
have
been
of
almost
unbelievable
baseness
the
mobbing
of
harmless
socialists
the
prohibition
of
concerts
by
musicians
of
enemy
nationality
the
mutilation
of
cows
designed
for
shipment
abroad
to
feed
starving
children
the
roughing
of
women
service
as
the
persecution
of
helpless
foreigners
regardless
of
nationality
during
the
last
few
months
of
the
war
when
stories
of
the
tyrannical
of
conscripts
began
to
filter
back
to
the
united
states
it
was
predicted
that
they
would
demand
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
when
they
got
home
and
that
if
it
was
not
promptly
forthcoming
they
would
take
it
into
their
own
hands
it
was
predicted
too
that
they
would
array
themselves
against
the
excesses
of
palmer
burleson
and
company
and
insist
upon
a
restoration
of
that
democratic
freedom
for
which
they
had
theoretically
fought
but
they
actually
did
none
of
these
things
so
far
as
i
know
not
a
single
martinet
of
a
lieutenant
or
captain
has
been
manhandled
by
his
late
victims
the
most
they
have
done
has
been
to
appeal
to
congress
for
revenge
and
damages
nor
have
they
thrown
their
influence
against
the
mediæval
despotism
which
grew
up
at
home
during
the
war
on
the
contrary
they
have
supported
it
actively
and
if
it
has
lessened
since
the
change
has
been
wrought
without
their
aid
and
in
spite
of
their
opposition
in
sum
they
show
all
the
stigmata
of
inferior
men
whose
natural
inferiority
has
been
made
worse
by
oppression
their
chief
organization
is
dominated
by
shrewd
who
operate
it
to
their
own
ends
politicians
in
search
of
jobs
chamber
of
commerce
and
other
such
vermin
it
seems
to
be
wholly
devoid
of
patriotism
courage
or
sense
nothing
quite
resembling
it
existed
in
the
country
before
the
war
not
even
in
the
south
there
is
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
on
earth
it
is
a
typical
product
of
two
years
of
heroic
effort
to
arouse
and
capitalize
the
worst
instincts
of
the
mob
and
it
symbolizes
very
dramatically
the
ill
effects
of
that
effort
upon
the
general
american
character
would
men
so
degraded
in
gallantry
and
honor
so
completely
purged
of
all
the
military
virtues
so
submerged
in
baseness
of
spirit
would
such
pitiful
caricatures
of
soldiers
offer
the
necessary
resistance
to
a
public
enemy
who
was
equal
or
perhaps
superior
in
men
and
resources
and
who
came
on
with
confidence
daring
and
resolution
say
england
supported
by
germany
as
and
with
her
inevitable
swarms
of
continental
allies
or
japan
with
the
asiatic
hordes
behind
her
against
the
best
opinion
of
the
chatauquas
of
congress
and
of
the
patriotic
press
i
presume
to
doubt
it
it
seems
to
me
quite
certain
indeed
that
an
american
army
fairly
representing
the
american
people
if
it
ever
meets
another
army
of
anything
remotely
resembling
like
strength
will
be
defeated
and
that
defeat
will
be
indistinguishable
from
rout
i
believe
that
at
any
odds
less
than
two
to
one
even
the
exhausted
german
army
of
would
have
defeated
it
and
in
this
view
i
think
i
am
joined
by
many
men
whose
military
judgment
is
far
better
than
mine
particularly
by
many
french
officers
the
changes
in
the
american
character
since
the
civil
war
due
partly
to
the
wearing
out
of
the
old
stock
inferior
to
begin
with
and
partly
to
the
infusion
of
the
worst
elements
of
other
stocks
have
surely
not
made
for
the
fostering
of
the
military
virtues
the
old
cool
head
is
gone
and
the
old
dogged
way
with
difficulties
the
typical
american
of
has
lost
all
the
love
of
liberty
that
his
forefathers
had
and
all
their
distrust
of
emotion
and
pride
in
he
is
led
no
longer
by
davy
crocketts
he
is
led
by
cheer
leaders
press
agents
uplifters
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
and
inflammatory
fellow
shoved
into
a
war
demanding
every
resource
of
courage
ingenuity
and
pertinacity
would
give
a
good
account
of
himself
he
is
fit
for
and
but
he
is
not
fit
for
tight
corners
and
desperate
odds
nevertheless
his
docility
and
pusillanimity
may
be
overestimated
and
sometimes
i
think
that
they
overestimated
by
his
present
masters
they
assume
that
there
is
absolutely
no
limit
to
his
capacity
for
being
put
on
and
knocked
about
that
he
will
submit
to
any
invasion
of
his
freedom
and
dignity
however
outrageous
so
long
as
it
is
depicted
in
melodious
terms
he
permitted
the
late
war
to
be
sold
to
him
by
the
methods
of
the
auctioneer
he
submitted
to
conscription
without
any
of
the
resistance
shown
by
his
brother
democrats
of
canada
and
australia
he
got
no
further
than
academic
protests
against
the
brutal
usage
he
had
to
face
in
the
army
he
came
home
and
found
prohibition
foisted
on
him
and
contented
himself
with
a
few
feeble
objurgations
he
is
a
pliant
slave
of
capitalism
and
ever
ready
to
help
it
put
down
who
venture
to
revolt
but
this
very
weakness
this
very
credulity
and
poverty
of
spirit
on
some
easily
conceivable
may
convert
him
into
a
rebel
of
a
peculiarly
insane
kind
and
so
beset
the
republic
from
within
with
difficulties
quite
as
formidable
as
those
which
threaten
to
afflict
it
from
without
what
james
wood
calls
the
corsair
of
democracy
that
is
the
professional
the
merchant
of
delusions
the
of
popular
fears
and
rages
is
still
content
to
work
for
capitalism
and
capitalism
knows
how
to
reward
him
to
his
taste
he
is
the
eloquent
statesman
the
patriotic
editor
the
fount
of
inspiration
the
prancing
of
optimism
he
becomes
public
leader
governor
senator
president
he
is
billy

curtis
frank
crane
charles

wilson
cal
coolidge
general
wood
harding
his
perhaps
is
the
best
of
trades
under
democracy
but
it
has
its
temptations
let
us
try
to
picture
a
master
corsair
thoroughly
adept
at
pulling
the
mob
nose
who
suddenly
bethought
himself
of
that
pepin
the
short
who
found
himself
mayor
of
the
palace
and
made
himself
king
of
the
franks
there
were
lightnings
along
that
horizon
in
the
days
of
roosevelt
there
were
thunder
growls
when
bryan
emerged
from
the
nebraska
steppes
on
some
great
day
of
fate
as
yet
unrevealed
by
the
gods
such
a
professor
of
the
central
democratic
science
may
throw
off
his
employers
and
set
up
a
business
for
himself
when
that
day
comes
there
will
be
plenty
of
excuse
for
black
type
on
the
front
pages
of
the
newspapers
i
incline
to
think
that
military
disaster
will
give
him
his
inspiration
and
his
opportunity
that
he
will
take
the
form
so
dear
to
democracies
of
a
man
on
horseback
the
chances
are
bad
simply
because
the
mob
is
relatively
comfortable
because
capitalism
has
been
able
to
give
it
relative
ease
and
plenty
of
food
in
return
for
its
docility
genuine
poverty
is
very
rare
in
the
united
states
and
actual
hardship
is
almost
unknown
there
are
times
when
the
proletariat
is
short
of
phonograph
records
silk
shirts
and
movie
tickets
but
there
are
very
few
times
when
it
is
short
of
nourishment
even
during
the
most
severe
business
depression
with
hundreds
of
thousands
out
of
work
most
of
these
apparent
sufferers
if
they
are
willing
are
able
to
get
livings
outside
their
trades
the
cities
may
be
choked
with
idle
men
but
the
country
is
nearly
always
short
of
labor
and
if
all
other
resources
fail
there
are
always
public
agencies
to
feed
the
hungry
capitalism
is
careful
to
keep
them
from
despair
no
american
knows
what
it
means
to
live
as
millions
of
europeans
lived
during
the
war
and
have
lived
in
some
places
since
with
the
loaves
of
the
baker
reduced
to
half
size
and
no
meat
at
all
in
the
meatshop
but
the
time
may
come
and
it
may
not
be
far
off
a
national
military
disaster
would
disorganize
all
industry
in
the
united
states
already
sufficiently
wasteful
and
chaotic
and
introduce
the
american
people
for
the
first
time
in
their
history
to
genuine
want
and
capital
would
be
unable
to
relieve
them
the
day
of
such
disaster
will
bring
the
savior
foreordained
the
slaves
will
follow
him
their
eyes
fixed
ecstatically
upon
the
newest
new
jerusalem
men
bred
to
respond
automatically
to
shibboleths
will
respond
to
this
worst
and
most
insane
one
bolshevism
said
general
foch
is
a
disease
of
defeated
nations
but
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
predict
no
revolution
in
the
grand
manner
no
melodramatic
collapse
of
capitalism
no
repetition
of
what
has
gone
on
in
russia
the
american
proletarian
is
not
brave
and
romantic
enough
for
that
to
do
him
simple
justice
he
is
not
silly
enough
capitalism
in
the
long
run
will
win
in
the
united
states
if
only
for
the
reason
that
every
american
hopes
to
be
a
capitalist
before
he
dies
its
roots
go
down
to
the
deepest
darkest
levels
of
the
national
soil
in
all
its
characters
and
particularly
in
its
antipathy
to
the
dreams
of
man
it
is
thoroughly
american
it
seems
to
be
immovably
secure
given
continued
peace
and
plenty
and
not
all
the
demagogues
in
the
land
consecrating
themselves
desperately
to
the
one
holy
purpose
could
shake
it
only
a
cataclysm
will
ever
do
that
but
is
a
cataclysm
conceivable
is
the
united
states
the
richest
nation
ever
heard
of
in
history
and
is
it
a
fact
that
modern
wars
are
won
by
money
it
is
not
a
fact
wars
are
won
as
in
napoleon
day
by
the
largest
battalions
and
the
largest
battalions
in
the
next
great
struggle
may
not
be
on
the
side
of
the
republic
the
usurious
profits
it
wrung
from
the
last
war
are
as
tempting
as
negotiable
securities
hung
on
the
as
scotch
stored
in
open
cellars
its
knavish
ways
with
friends
and
foes
alike
have
left
it
only
foes
it
is
plunging
into
a
competition
for
a
living
in
the
world
that
will
be
to
the
death
and
the
late
disarmament
conference
left
it
almost
hamstrung
before
the
conference
it
had
the
pacific
in
its
grip
and
with
the
pacific
in
its
grip
it
might
have
parleyed
for
a
fair
half
of
the
atlantic
but
when
the
japs
and
the
english
had
finished
their
operations
upon
the
feather
duster
popinjay
lodge
root
vacuum
underwood
young
teddy
roosevelt
and
the
rest
of
their
dupes
there
was
apparent
a
baleful
change
the
republic
is
extremely
insecure
on
both
fronts
and
it
will
be
more
insecure
and
it
has
no
friends
however
as
i
say
i
do
not
fear
for
capitalism
it
will
weather
the
storm
and
no
doubt
it
will
be
the
stronger
for
it
afterward
the
inferior
man
hates
it
but
there
is
too
much
envy
mixed
with
his
hatred
in
the
land
of
the
theoretically
free
for
him
to
want
to
destroy
it
utterly
or
even
to
wound
it
incurably
he
struggles
against
it
now
but
always
wistfully
always
with
a
sneaking
respect
on
the
day
of
armageddon
he
may
attempt
a
more
violent
onslaught
but
in
long
run
he
will
be
beaten
in
the
long
run
the
corsairs
will
sell
him
out
and
hand
him
over
to
his
enemy
perhaps
who
knows
the
combat
may
raise
that
enemy
to
genuine
strength
and
dignity
out
of
it
may
come
the
superman
all
the
while
i
have
been
forgetting
the
third
of
my
reasons
for
remaining
so
faithful
a
citizen
of
the
federation
despite
all
the
lascivious
inducements
from
expatriates
to
follow
them
beyond
the
seas
and
all
the
surly
suggestions
from
patriots
that
i
succumb
it
is
the
reason
which
grows
out
of
my
mediæval
but
unashamed
taste
for
the
bizarre
and
indelicate
my
congenital
weakness
for
comedy
of
the
grosser
varieties
the
united
states
to
my
eye
is
incomparably
the
greatest
show
on
earth
it
is
a
show
which
avoids
diligently
all
the
kinds
of
clowning
which
tire
me
most
quickly
for
example
royal
ceremonials
the
tedious
of
politique
the
taking
of
politics
seriously
and
lays
chief
stress
upon
the
kinds
which
delight
me
unceasingly
for
example
the
ribald
combats
of
demagogues
the
exquisitely
ingenious
operations
of
master
rogues
the
pursuit
of
witches
and
heretics
the
desperate
struggles
of
inferior
men
to
claw
their
way
into
heaven
we
have
clowns
in
constant
practice
among
us
who
are
as
far
above
the
clowns
of
any
other
great
state
as
a
jack
dempsey
is
above
a
paralytic
and
not
a
few
dozen
or
score
of
them
but
whole
droves
and
herds
human
enterprises
which
in
all
other
christian
countries
are
resigned
despairingly
to
an
incurable
dullness
things
that
seem
devoid
of
exhilarating
amusement
by
their
very
nature
are
here
lifted
to
such
vast
heights
of
buffoonery
that
contemplating
them
strains
the
almost
to
breaking
i
cite
an
example
the
worship
of
god
everywhere
else
on
earth
it
is
carried
on
in
a
solemn
and
dispiriting
manner
in
england
of
course
the
bishops
are
obscene
but
the
average
man
seldom
gets
a
fair
chance
to
laugh
at
them
and
enjoy
them
now
come
home
here
we
not
only
have
bishops
who
are
enormously
more
obscene
than
even
the
most
gifted
of
the
english
bishops
we
have
also
a
huge
force
of
lesser
specialists
in
ecclesiastical
mountebankery
loyolas
savonarolas
and
xaviers
of
a
hundred
fantastic
rites
each
performing
untiringly
and
each
full
of
a
grotesque
and
illimitable
whimsicality
every
american
town
however
small
has
one
of
its
own
a
holy
clerk
with
so
fine
a
talent
for
introducing
the
arts
of
jazz
into
the
salvation
of
the
damned
that
his
performance
takes
on
all
the
gaudiness
of
a
circus
and
the
bald
announcement
that
he
will
raid
hell
on
such
and
such
a
night
is
enough
to
empty
all
the
town
and
bordellos
and
pack
his
sanctuary
to
the
doors
and
to
aid
him
and
inspire
him
there
are
traveling
experts
to
whom
he
stands
in
the
relation
of
a
wart
to
the
matterhorn
stupendous
masters
of
theological
imbecility
contrivers
of
doctrines
utterly
preposterous
heirs
to
the
joseph
smith
mother
eddy
and
john
alexander
dowie
tradition
bryan
sunday
and
their
like
these
are
the
eminences
of
the
american
sacred
college
i
delight
in
them
their
proceedings
make
me
a
happier
american
turn
now
to
politics
consider
for
example
a
campaign
for
the
presidency
would
it
be
possible
to
imagine
anything
more
uproariously
idiotic
a
deafening
battle
to
the
death
between
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
harlequin
and
sganarelle
gobbo
and
cook
the
unspeakable
with
fearful
snorts
gradually
swallowing
the
inconceivable
i
defy
any
one
to
match
it
elsewhere
on
this
earth
in
other
lands
at
worst
there
are
at
least
intelligible
issues
coherent
ideas
salient
personalities
somebody
says
something
and
somebody
replies
but
what
did
harding
say
in
and
what
did
cox
reply
who
was
harding
anyhow
and
who
was
cox
here
having
perfected
democracy
we
lift
the
whole
combat
to
symbolism
to
transcendentalism
to
metaphysics
here
we
load
a
pair
of
palpably
tin
cannon
with
blank
cartridges
charged
with
talcum
powder
and
so
let
fly
here
one
may
howl
over
the
show
without
any
uneasy
reminder
that
it
is
serious
and
that
some
one
may
be
hurt
i
hold
that
this
elevation
of
politics
to
the
plane
of
undiluted
comedy
is
peculiarly
american
that
nowhere
else
on
this
disreputable
ball
has
the
art
of
the
been
developed
to
such
fineness
two
experiences
are
in
point
during
the
combat
of
bladders
an
article
of
mine
dealing
with
some
of
its
more
melodramatic
phases
was
translated
into
german
and
reprinted
by
a
berlin
paper
at
the
head
of
it
the
editor
was
careful
to
insert
a
preface
explaining
to
his
readers
but
recently
delivered
to
democracy
that
such
contests
were
not
taken
seriously
by
intelligent
americans
and
warning
them
solemnly
against
getting
into
sweats
over
politics
at
about
the
same
time
i
had
dinner
with
an
englishman
from
cocktails
to
bromo
seltzer
he
bewailed
the
political
lassitude
of
the
english
populace
its
growing
indifference
to
the
whole
partisan
harlequinade
here
were
two
typical
foreign
attitudes
the
germans
were
in
danger
of
making
politics
too
harsh
and
implacable
and
the
english
were
in
danger
of
forgetting
politics
altogether
both
attitudes
it
must
be
plain
make
for
bad
shows
observing
a
german
campaign
one
is
uncomfortably
harassed
and
stirred
up
observing
an
english
campaign
at
least
in
times
of
peace
one
falls
asleep
in
the
united
states
the
thing
is
done
better
here
politics
is
purged
of
all
menace
all
sinister
quality
all
genuine
significance
and
stuffed
with
such
gorgeous
humors
such
inordinate
farce
that
one
comes
to
the
end
of
a
campaign
with
one
ribs
loose
and
ready
for
king
lear
or
a
hanging
or
a
course
of
medical
journals
but
feeling
better
for
the
laugh
si
sapis
said
martial
mirth
is
necessary
to
wisdom
to
comfort
above
all
to
happiness
well
here
is
the
land
of
mirth
as
germany
is
the
land
of
metaphysics
and
france
is
the
land
of
fornication
here
the
buffoonery
never
stops
what
could
be
more
delightful
than
the
endless
struggle
of
the
puritan
to
make
the
joy
of
the
minority
unlawful
and
impossible
the
effort
is
itself
a
greater
joy
to
one
standing
on
the
that
any
or
all
of
the
carnal
joys
that
it
combats
always
when
i
contemplate
an
uplifter
at
his
hopeless
business
i
recall
a
scene
in
an
burlesque
show
witnessed
for
hire
in
my
days
as
a
dramatic
critic
a
chorus
girl
executed
a
fall
upon
the
stage
and
rudolph
krausemeyer
the
swiss
comedian
rushed
to
her
aid
as
he
stooped
painfully
to
succor
her
irving
rabinovitz
the
zionist
comedian
fetched
him
a
fearful
clout
across
the
cofferdam
with
a
so
the
uplifter
the
the
americanizer
striving
to
make
the
republic
fit
for
secretaries
he
is
the
eternal
american
ever
moved
by
the
best
of
intentions
ever
running
krausemeyer
to
the
rescue
of
virtue
and
ever
getting
his
pantaloons
fanned
by
the
devil
i
am
naturally
sinful
and
such
spectacles
caress
me
if
the
were
a
the
show
would
be
cruel
and
i
probably
complain
to
the
as
it
is
i
know
that
the
uplifter
is
not
really
hurt
but
simply
shocked
the
blow
in
fact
does
him
good
for
it
helps
to
get
him
into
heaven
as
exegetes
prove
from
matthew
v
vous
outragera
vous
persécutera
and
so
on
as
for
me
it
makes
me
a
more
contented
man
and
hence
a
better
citizen
one
man
prefers
the
republic
because
it
pays
better
wages
than
bulgaria
another
because
it
has
laws
to
keep
him
sober
and
his
daughter
chaste
another
because
the
woolworth
building
is
higher
than
the
cathedral
at
chartres
another
because
living
here
he
can
read
the
new
york
another
because
there
is
a
warrant
out
for
him
somewhere
else
me
i
like
it
because
it
amuses
me
to
my
taste
i
never
get
tired
of
the
show
it
is
worth
every
cent
it
costs
that
cost
it
seems
to
me
is
very
moderate
taxes
in
the
united
states
are
not
actually
high
i
figure
for
example
that
my
private
share
of
the
expense
of
maintaining
the
hon
harding
in
the
white
house
this
year
will
work
out
to
less
than
cents
try
to
think
of
better
sport
for
the
money
in
new
york
it
has
been
estimated
that
it
costs
to
get
comfortably
tight
and
on
an
average
to
pinch
a
girl
arm
the
united
states
senate
will
cost
me
perhaps
for
the
year
but
against
that
expense
set
the
subscription
price
of
the
record
about
which
as
a
journalist
i
receive
for
nothing
for
less
than
nothing
i
am
thus
entertained
as
solomon
never
was
by
his
hooch
dancers
george
brinton
mcclellan
harvey
costs
me
but
cents
a
year
i
get
nicholas
murray
butler
free
finally
there
is
young
teddy
roosevelt
the
naval
expert
teddy
costs
me
as
i
work
it
out
about
cents
a
year
or
less
than
a
cent
a
month
more
he
entertains
me
doubly
for
the
money
first
as
naval
expert
and
secondly
as
a
walking
upon
democracy
a
devastating
proof
that
there
is
nothing
after
all
in
that
superstition
we
americans
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
of
human
equality
and
the
rooseveltii
reduce
it
to
an
absurdity
as
brilliantly
as
the
sons
of
veit
bach
where
is
your
equal
opportunity
now
here
in
this
eden
of
clowns
with
the
highest
rewards
of
clowning
theoretically
open
to
every
poor
boy
here
in
the
very
citadel
of
democracy
we
found
and
cherish
a
clown
ii
huneker
a
memory
there
was
a
stimulating
aliveness
about
him
always
an
air
of
living
eagerly
and
a
bit
recklessly
a
sort
of
defiant
resiliency
in
his
very
frame
and
form
something
provocative
showed
itself
an
insolent
singularity
obvious
to
even
the
most
careless
glance
that
caligulan
profile
of
his
was
more
than
simply
unusual
in
a
free
republic
consecrated
to
good
works
to
a
respectable
american
encountering
it
in
the
lobby
of
the
metropolitan
or
in
the
of
a
it
must
have
suggested
inevitably
the
dark
enterprises
and
illicit
metaphysics
of
a
heliogabalus
more
there
was
always
something
rakish
and
defiant
about
his
hat
it
was
too
white
or
it
curled
in
the
wrong
way
or
a
feather
peeped
from
the
band
and
a
hint
of
antinomianism
in
his
cravat
yet
more
he
ran
to
exotic
tastes
in
eating
and
drinking
preferring
occult
goulashes
and
to
honest
american
steaks
and
great
floods
of
pilsner
to
the
harsh
beverages
of
men
finally
there
was
his
talk
that
cataract
of
sublime
trivialities
gossip
lifted
to
the
plane
of
the
gods
the
unmentionable
bedizened
with
an
astounding
importance
and
even
profundity
in
his
early
days
when
he
performed
the
tonal
and
carnal
prodigies
that
he
liked
to
talk
of
afterward
i
was
at
nurse
and
too
young
to
have
any
traffic
with
him
when
i
encountered
him
at
last
he
was
in
the
high
flush
of
the
middle
years
and
had
already
become
a
tradition
in
the
little
world
that
critics
inhabit
we
sat
down
to
luncheon
at
one
i
think
it
must
have
been
at
lüchow
his
favorite
refuge
and
rostrum
to
the
end
at
six
when
i
had
to
go
the
waiter
was
hauling
in
his
tenth
or
was
it
twentieth
of
pilsner
and
he
was
bringing
to
a
close
the
most
amazing
monologue
that
these
ears
up
to
that
time
had
ever
funnelled
into
this
consciousness
what
a
stew
indeed
berlioz
and
the
question
of
the
of
the
viola
the
psychopathological
causes
of
the
suicide
of
tschaikowsky
why
nietzsche
had
to
leave
sils
maria
between
days
in
the
echoes
of
flaubert
in
joseph
conrad
then
but
newly
dawned
the
precise
topography
of
the
warts
of

i
left
in
a
sort
of
fever
and
it
was
a
couple
of
days
later
before
i
began
to
sort
out
my
impressions
and
formulate
a
coherent
image
was
the
man
allusive
in
his
books
so
allusive
that
popular
report
credited
him
with
the
actual
manufacture
of
authorities
then
he
was
ten
times
as
allusive
in
his
discourse
a
veritable
geyser
of
unfamiliar
names
shocking
epigrams
in
strange
tongues
unearthly
philosophies
out

transylvania

and
did
he
in

facilely
from

to

and
from
the

to
his

to

of

then
at
the
he
began
long
beyond
the
point
where
the
last
honest
wife
gives
up
the
ghost
and
so
full
tilt
ran
into
such
complexities
of

that
a
plain
sinner
could
scarcely
follow
him
i
try
to
give
you
ineptly
and
grotesquely
some
notion
of
the
talk
of
the
man
but
i
must
fail
inevitably
it
was
in
brief
chaos
and
chaos
can
not
be
described
but
it
was
chaos
made
to
gleam
and
corruscate
with
every
device
of
the
seven
arts
chaos
drenched
in
all
the
colors
imaginable
chaos
scored
for
an
orchestra
which
made
the
great
band
of
berlioz
seem
like
a
fife
and
drum
corps
one
night
a
few
months
before
the
war
i
sat
in
the
paris
opera
house
listening
to
the
first
performance
of
richard
strauss
josef
legend
with
strauss
himself
conducting
on
the
stage
there
was
a
riot
of
hues
that
swung
the
eyes
and
in
a
crazy
mazurka
in
the
orchestra
there
were
such
volleys
and
explosions
of
tone
that
the
ears
i
fall
into
a
hunekeran
trope
began
to
go
pale
and
clammy
with
surgical
shock
suddenly
above
all
the
uproar
a
piccolo
launched
into
a
new
and
saucy
tune
in
an
unrelated
key
instantly
and
quite
naturally
i
thought
of
the
incomparable
james
when
he
gave
a
show
at
lüchow
he
never
forgot
that
anarchistic
passage
for
the
piccolo
i
observe
a
tendency
since
his
death
to
estimate
him
in
terms
of
the
content
of
his
books
even
frank
harris
who
certainly
should
know
better
goes
there
for
the
facts
about
him
nothing
could
do
him
worse
injustice
in
those
books
of
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
perfectly
sound
stuff
the
wonder
is
in
truth
that
so
much
of
it
holds
up
so
well
for
example
the
essays
on
strauss
on
brahms
and
on
nietzsche
and
the
whole
volume
on
chopin
but
the
real
huneker
never
got
himself
formally
between
covers
if
one
forgets
old
fogy
and
parts
of
painted
veils
the
volumes
of
his
regular
canon
are
made
up
in
the
main
of
articles
written
for
the
more
intellectual
magazines
and
newspapers
of
their
era
and
they
are
full
of
a
conscious
striving
to
qualify
for
respectable
company
huneker
always
curiously
modest
never
got
over
the
notion
that
it
was
a
singular
honor
for
a
man
such
as
he
a
mere
diurnal
scribbler
innocent
of
academic
robes
to
be
published
by
so
austere
a
publisher
as
scribner
more
than
once
anchored
at
the
we
discussed
the
matter
at
length
i
always
arguing
that
all
the
honor
was
enjoyed
by
scribner
but
huneker
i
believe
in
all
sincerity
would
not
have
it
so
any
more
than
he
would
have
it
that
he
was
a
better
music
critic
than
his
two
colleagues
the
pedantic
krehbiel
and
the
nonsensical
finck
this
illogical
modesty
of
course
had
its
limits
it
made
him
cautious
about
expressing
himself
but
it
seldom
led
him
into
downright
assumptions
of
false
personality
nowhere
in
all
his
books
will
you
find
him
doing
the
things
that
every
critic
is
supposed
to
do
the
middleton
murry
paul
elmer
more
sort
of
puerility
solemn
essays
on
coleridge
and
addison
abysmal
discussions
of
the
relative
merits
of
schumann
and
mendelssohn
horrible
treatises
upon
the
relations
of
goethe
to
the
romantic
movement
dull
scratchings
in
a
hundred
such
exhausted
and
sterile
fields
such
enterprises
were
not
for
huneker
he
kept
himself
out
of
that
black
coat
but
i
am
convinced
that
he
always
had
his
own
raiment
pressed
carefully
before
he
left
lüchow
for
the
temple
of
athene
and
maybe
changed
cravats
and
put
on
a
boiled
shirt
and
took
the
feather
out
of
his
hat
the
huneker
the
huneker
who
was
the
true
essence
and
prime
motor
of
the
more
courtly
huneker
remained
behind
this
real
huneker
survives
in
conversations
that
still
haunt
the
rafters
of
the
of
two
continents
and
in
a
vast
mass
of
newspaper
impromptus
thrown
off
too
hastily
to
be
reduced
to
complete
decorum
and
in
two
books
that
stand
outside
the
official
canon
and
yet
contain
the
man
himself
as
not
even
iconoclasts
or
the
chopin
book
contains
him
to
wit
the
old
fogy
aforesaid
and
the
painted
veils
of
his
last
year
both
were
published
so
to
speak
out
of
the
back
door
the
former
by
a
music
publisher
in
philadelphia
and
the
latter
in
a
small
and
expensive
edition
for
the
admittedly
damned
there
is
a
chapter
in
painted
veils
that
is
huneker
to
every
last
hitch
of
the
shoulders
and
twinkle
of
the
eye
the
chapter
in
which
the
hero
soliloquizes
on
art
life
immortality
and
women
especially
women
and
there
are
half
a
dozen
chapters
in
old
fogy
superficially
buffoonery
but
how
penetrating
how
gorgeously
flavored
how
learned
that
come
completely
up
to
the
same
high
specification
if
i
had
to
choose
one
huneker
book
and
give
up
all
the
others
i
choose
old
fogy
instantly
in
it
huneker
is
utterly
himself
in
it
the
last
trace
of
the
pedagogue
vanishes
art
is
no
longer
even
by
implication
a
device
for
improving
the
mind
it
is
wholly
a
magnificent
adventure
that
notion
of
it
is
what
huneker
brought
into
american
criticism
and
it
is
for
that
bringing
that
he
will
be
remembered
no
other
critic
of
his
generation
had
a
tenth
of
his
influence
almost
he
overthrew
the
æsthetic
theory
that
had
flourished
in
the
united
states
since
the
death
of
poe
and
set
up
an
utterly
contrary
æsthetic
theory
in
its
place
if
the
younger
men
of
have
emancipated
themselves
from
the
puritan
æsthetic
if
the
schoolmaster
is
now
palpably
on
the
defensive
and
no
longer
the
unchallenged
assassin
of
the
fine
arts
that
he
once
was
if
he
has
already
begun
to
compromise
somewhat
absurdly
with
new
and
sounder
ideas
and
even
to
lift
his
voice
in
artificial
hosannahs
then
huneker
certainly
deserves
all
the
credit
for
the
change
what
he
brought
back
from
paris
was
precisely
the
thing
that
was
most
suspected
in
the
america
of
those
days
the
capacity
for
gusto
huneker
had
that
capacity
in
a
degree
unmatched
by
any
other
critic
when
his
soul
went
adventuring
among
masterpieces
it
did
not
go
in
sunday
it
went
with
vine
leaves
in
its
hair
the
rest
of
the
appraisers
and
even
howells
with
all
his
humor
could
never
quite
rid
themselves
of
the
professorial
manner
when
they
praised
it
was
always
with
some
hint
of
ethical
or
at
all
events
of
cultural
purpose
when
they
condemned
that
purpose
was
even
plainer
the
arts
to
them
constituted
a
sort
of
school
for
the
psyche
their
aim
was
to
discipline
and
mellow
the
spirit
but
to
huneker
their
one
aim
was
always
to
make
the
spirit
glad
to
set
it
in
nietzsche
phrase
to
dancing
with
arms
and
legs
he
had
absolutely
no
feeling
for
valuations
if
a
work
of
art
that
stood
before
him
was
honest
if
it
was
original
if
it
was
beautiful
and
thoroughly
alive
then
he
was
for
it
to
his
last
corpuscle
what
if
it
violated
all
the
accepted
canons
then
let
the
accepted
canons
go
hang
what
if
it
lacked
all
purpose
to
improve
and
lift
up
then
so
much
the
better
what
if
it
shocked
all
men
and
made
them
blush
and
tremble
then
damn
all
men
of
right
feeling
forevermore
with
this
ethical
atheism
so
strange
in
the
united
states
and
so
abhorrent
to
most
americans
there
went
something
that
was
probably
also
part
of
the
loot
of
paris
an
insatiable
curiosity
about
the
artist
as
man
this
curiosity
was
responsible
for
two
of
salient
characters
his
habit
of
mixing
even
the
most
serious
criticism
with
cynical
and
often
scandalous
gossip
and
his
pervasive
foreignness
i
believe
that
it
is
almost
literally
true
to
say
that
he
could
never
quite
make
up
his
mind
about
a
new
symphony
until
he
had
seen
the
composer
mistress
or
at
all
events
a
good
photograph
of
her
he
thought
of
wagner
not
alone
in
terms
of
melody
and
harmony
but
also
in
terms
of
the
tribschen
idyl
and
the
bayreuth
go
through
his
books
and
you
will
see
how
often
he
was
fascinated
by
mere
eccentricity
of
personality
i
doubt
that
even
huysmans
had
he
been
a
respectable
french
huguenot
would
have
interested
him
certainly
his
enthusiasm
for
verlaine
villiers
de
adam
and
other
such
fantastic
fish
was
centered
upon
the
men
quite
as
much
as
upon
the
artists
his
foreignness
so
often
urged
against
him
by
defenders
of
the
national
tradition
was
grounded
largely
on
the
fact
that
such
eccentric
personalities
were
rare
in
the
republic
rare
and
well
watched
by
the
when
one
bobbed
up
he
was
alert
at
once
even
though
the
newcomer
was
only
a
roosevelt
the
rest
of
the
american
people
he
dismissed
as
a
horde
of
slaves
cads
methodists
he
could
not
imagine
one
of
them
becoming
a
artist
save
by
a
miracle
even
the
american
executant
was
under
his
suspicion
for
he
knew
very
well
that
playing
the
fiddle
was
a
great
deal
more
than
scraping
four
strings
of
copper
and
catgut
with
a
switch
from
a
horse
tail
what
he
asked
himself
was
how
a
man
could
play
bach
decently
and
then
after
playing
go
from
the
hall
to
a
or
a
political
meeting
or
a
lecture
at
the
harvard
club
overseas
there
was
a
better
air
for
artists
and
overseas
huneker
looked
for
them
these
fundamental
theories
of
his
of
course
had
their
defects
they
were
a
bit
too
simple
and
often
very
much
too
hospitable
huneker
clinging
to
them
certainly
did
his
share
of
whooping
for
the
sort
of
revolutionist
who
is
here
and
gone
he
was
fugleman
in
his
time
for
more
than
one
cause
that
was
lost
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
stated
more
his
prejudices
made
him
somewhat
anæsthetic
at
times
to
the
new
men
who
were
not
brilliant
in
color
but
respectably
drab
and
who
tried
to
do
their
work
within
the
law
particularly
in
his
later
years
when
the
old
gusto
began
to
die
out
and
all
that
remained
of
it
was
habit
he
was
apt
to
go
chasing
after
strange
birds
and
so
miss
seeing
the
elephants
go
by
i
could
put
together
a
very
pretty
list
of
frauds
that
he
praised
i
could
concoct
another
list
of
genuine
that
he
overlooked
but
all
that
is
merely
saying
that
there
were
human
limits
to
him
the
professors
on
their
side
have
sinned
far
worse
and
in
both
directions
looking
back
over
the
whole
of
his
work
one
must
needs
be
amazed
by
the
general
soundness
of
his
judgments
he
discerned
in
the
main
what
was
good
and
he
described
it
in
terms
that
were
seldom
bettered
afterward
his
successive
heroes
always
under
fire
when
he
first
championed
them
almost
invariably
moved
to
secure
ground
and
became
solid
men
challenged
by
no
one
save
fools
ibsen
nietzsche
brahms
strauss
cézanne
stirner
synge
the
russian
composers
the
russian
novelists
he
did
for
this
western
world
what
georg
brandes
was
doing
for
continental
europe
sorting
out
the
new
comers
with
sharp
eyes
and
giving
mighty
lifts
to
those
who
deserved
it
brandes
did
it
in
terms
of
the
old
academic
bombast
he
was
never
more
the
professor
than
when
he
was
arguing
for
some
hobgoblin
of
the
professors
but
huneker
did
it
with
verve
and
grace
he
made
it
not
schoolmastering
but
a
glorious
deliverance
from
schoolmastering
as
i
say
his
influence
was
enormous
the
fine
arts
at
his
touch
shed
all
their
lugubriousness
and
became
provocative
and
joyous
the
spirit
of
senility
got
out
of
them
and
the
spirit
of
youth
got
into
them
his
criticism
for
all
its
french
basis
was
thoroughly
american
vastly
more
american
in
fact
than
the
new
england
ponderosity
that
it
displaced
though
he
was
an
easterner
and
a
cockney
of
the
cockneys
he
picked
up
some
of
the
western
spaciousness
that
showed
itself
in
mark
twain
and
all
the
young
men
followed
him
a
good
many
of
them
i
daresay
followed
him
so
ardently
that
they
got
a
good
distance
ahead
of
him
and
often
perhaps
embarrassed
him
by
taking
his
name
in
vain
for
all
his
enterprise
and
iconoclasm
indeed
there
was
not
much
of
the
berserker
in
him
and
his
floutings
of
the
national
æsthetic
tradition
seldom
took
the
form
of
forthright
challenges
here
the
strange
modesty
that
i
have
mentioned
always
stayed
him
as
a
like
weakness
stayed
mark
twain
he
could
never
quite
rid
himself
of
the
feeling
that
he
was
no
more
than
an
amateur
among
the
gaudy
doctors
who
roared
in
the
reviews
and
that
it
would
be
unseemly
for
him
to
forget
their
authority
i
have
a
notion
that
this
feeling
was
born
in
the
days
when
he
stood
almost
alone
with
the
whole
faculty
grouped
in
a
pained
circle
around
him
he
was
then
too
miserable
a
worm
to
be
noticed
at
all
later
on
gaining
importance
he
was
lectured
somewhat
severely
for
his
violation
of
decorum
in
england
even
max
beerbohm
made
an
idiotic
assault
upon
him
it
was
the
germans
and
the
french
in
fact
who
first
praised
him
intelligently
and
these
friends
were
too
far
away
to
help
a
timorous
man
in
a
row
at
home
this
sensation
of
isolation
and
littleness
i
suppose
explains
his
fidelity
to
the
newspapers
and
the
otherwise
inexplicable
joy
that
he
always
took
in
his
forgotten
work
for
the
courier
in
his
day
a
very
dubious
journal
in
such
waters
he
felt
at
ease
there
he
could
disport
without
thought
of
the
dignity
of
publishers
and
the
eagle
eyes
of
campus
reviewers
some
of
the
connections
that
he
formed
were
full
of
an
ironical
inappropriateness
his
discomforts
in
his
days
showed
themselves
in
the
feebleness
of
his
work
when
he
served
the
he
was
as
well
placed
as
a
cabell
at
a
colored
ball
perhaps
the
in
the
years
before
it
was
munseyized
offered
him
the
best
berth
that
he
ever
had
save
it
were
his
old
one
on
new
but
whatever
the
flag
he
served
it
loyally
and
got
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
the
business
he
liked
the
pressure
of
newspaper
work
he
liked
the
associations
that
it
involved
the
gabble
in
the
of
the
opera
house
the
exchanges
of
news
and
gossip
above
all
he
liked
the
relative
ease
of
the
intellectual
harness
in
a
newspaper
article
he
could
say
whatever
happened
to
pop
into
his
mind
and
if
it
looked
thin
the
next
day
then
there
was
after
all
no
harm
done
but
when
he
sat
down
to
write
a
book
or
rather
to
compile
it
for
all
of
his
volumes
were
reworked
magazine
and
sometimes
newspaper
articles
he
became
and
so
knew
uneasiness
the
tightness
of
his
style
its
one
salient
defect
was
probably
the
result
of
this
weakness
the
corrected
clippings
that
constituted
most
of
his
manuscripts
are
so
beladen
with
revisions
and
rerevisions
that
they
are
almost
indecipherable
thus
the
growth
of
huneker
celebrity
in
his
later
years
filled
him
with
wonder
and
never
quite
convinced
him
he
was
certainly
wholly
free
from
any
desire
to
gather
disciples
about
him
and
found
a
school
there
was
of
course
some
pride
of
authorship
in
him
and
he
liked
to
know
that
his
books
were
read
and
admired
in
particular
he
was
pleased
by
their
translation
into
german
and
czech
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
shrank
from
the
bellicosity
that
so
often
got
into
praise
of
them
that
he
disliked
being
set
up
as
the
opponent
and
superior
of
the
professors
whom
he
always
vaguely
respected
and
the
rival
newspaper
critics
whose
friendship
he
esteemed
far
above
their
professional
admiration
or
even
respect
i
could
never
draw
him
into
a
discussion
of
these
rivals
save
perhaps
a
discussion
of
their
historic
feats
at
he
wrote
vastly
better
than
any
of
them
and
knew
far
more
about
the
arts
than
most
of
them
and
he
was
undoubtedly
aware
of
it
in
his
heart
but
it
embarrassed
him
to
hear
this
superiority
put
into
plain
terms
his
intense
gregariousness
probably
accounted
for
part
of
this
reluctance
to
pit
himself
against
them
he
could
not
imagine
a
world
without
a
great
deal
of
easy
comradeship
in
it
and
much
casual
slapping
of
backs
but
under
it
all
was
the
chronic
underestimation
of
himself
that
i
have
discussed
his
fear
that
he
had
spread
himself
over
too
many
arts
and
that
his
equipment
was
thus
defective
in
every
one
of
them
steeplejack
is
full
of
this
apologetic
timidity
in
its
very
title
as
he
explains
it
there
is
a
confession
of
inferiority
that
is
almost
maudlin
life
has
been
the
barmecide
feast
to
me
and
so
on
in
the
book
itself
he
constantly
takes
refuge
in
triviality
from
the
harsh
challenges
of
critical
parties
and
as
constantly
avoids
facts
that
would
shock
the
philistines
one
might
reasonably
assume
reading
it
from
end
to
end
that
his
early
days
in
paris
were
spent
in
the
fashion
of
a
secretary
a
few
drinking
bouts
of
course
and
a
love
affair
in
the
manner
of
dubuque
iowa
but
where
are
the
wenches
more
than
once
indeed
the
book
sinks
to
downright
equivocation
for
example
in
the
roosevelt
episodes
certainly
no
one
who
knew
huneker
in
life
will
ever
argue
seriously
that
he
was
deceived
by
the
roosevelt
buncombe
or
that
his
view
of
life
was
at
all
comparable
to
that
of
the
great
demagogue
he
stood
in
fact
at
the
opposite
pole
he
saw
the
world
not
as
a
moral
show
but
as
a
sort
of
glorified
follies
he
was
absolutely
devoid
of
that
obsession
with
the
problem
of
conduct
which
was
roosevelt
main
virtue
in
the
eyes
of
a
stupid
and
superstitious
people
more
he
was
wholly
against
roosevelt
on
many
concrete
issues
the
race
suicide
banality
the
panama
swindle
the
war
he
was
far
too
much
the
realist
to
believe
in
the
american
case
either
before
or
after
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
urged
by
roosevelt
and
others
violated
his
notions
of
truth
honor
and
decency
i
assume
nothing
here
i
simply
record
what
he
told
me
himself
nevertheless
the
sheer
notoriety
of
the
rough
rider
his
picturesque
personality
and
talent
as
a
mountebank
had
its
effect
on
huneker
and
so
he
was
a
bit
flattered
when
he
was
summoned
to
oyster
bay
and
there
accepted
gravely
the
nonsense
that
was
poured
into
his
ear
and
even
repeated
some
of
it
without
a
cackle
in
his
book
to
say
that
he
actually
believed
in
it
would
be
to
libel
him
it
was
precisely
such
hollow
tosh
that
he
stood
against
in
his
rôle
of
critic
of
art
and
life
it
was
by
exposing
its
hollowness
that
he
lifted
himself
above
the
general
the
same
weakness
induced
him
to
accept
membership
in
the
national
institute
of
arts
and
letters
the
offer
of
it
to
a
man
of
his
age
and
attainments
after
he
had
been
passed
over
year
after
year
in
favor
of
all
sorts
of
cheapjack
novelists
and
compilers
of
college
textbooks
was
intrinsically
insulting
it
was
almost
as
if
the
musical
union
had
offered
to
admit
a
brahms
but
with
the
insult
went
a
certain
gage
of
respectability
a
certain
formal
forgiveness
for
old
frivolities
a
certain
abatement
of
old
doubts
and
and
so
huneker
accepted
later
on
reviewing
the
episode
in
his
own
mind
he
found
it
the
spring
of
doubts
that
were
even
more
uncomfortable
his
last
letter
to
me
was
devoted
to
the
matter
he
was
by
then
eager
to
maintain
that
he
had
got
in
by
a
process
only
partly
under
his
control
and
that
being
in
he
could
discover
no
decorous
way
of
getting
out
but
perhaps
i
devote
too
much
space
to
the
elements
in
the
man
that
worked
against
his
own
free
development
they
were
after
all
grounded
upon
qualities
that
are
certainly
not
to
be
deprecated
modesty
to
his
a
fine
sense
of
a
distaste
for
acrimonious
and
useless
strife
these
qualities
gave
him
great
charm
he
was
not
only
humorous
he
was
also
even
when
the
crushing
discomforts
of
his
last
illness
were
upon
him
his
amiability
never
faltered
and
in
addition
to
humor
there
was
wit
a
far
rarer
thing
his
most
casual
talk
was
full
of
this
wit
and
it
bathed
everything
that
he
discussed
in
a
new
and
brilliant
light
i
have
never
encountered
a
man
who
was
further
removed
from
dullness
it
seemed
a
literal
impossibility
for
him
to
open
his
mouth
without
discharging
some
word
or
phrase
that
arrested
the
attention
and
stuck
in
the
memory
and
under
it
all
giving
an
extraordinary
quality
to
the
verbal
fireworks
there
was
a
solid
and
apparently
illimitable
learning
the
man
knew
as
much
as
forty
average
men
and
his
knowledge
was
and
instantly
available
he
had
read
everything
and
had
seen
everything
and
heard
everything
and
nothing
that
he
had
ever
read
or
seen
or
heard
quite
passed
out
of
his
mind
here
in
three
words
was
the
main
virtue
of
his
criticism
its
gigantic
richness
it
had
the
dazzling
charm
of
an
ornate
and
intricate
design
a
blazing
fabric
of
fine
silks
it
was
no
mere
pontifical
statement
of
one
man
reactions
to
a
set
of
ideas
it
was
a
sort
of
essence
of
the
reactions
of
many
men
of
all
the
men
in
fact
worth
hearing
huneker
discarded
their
scaffolding
their
ifs
and
whereases
and
presented
only
what
was
important
and
arresting
in
their
conclusions
it
was
never
a
mere
the
selection
was
made
delicately
discreetly
with
almost
unerring
taste
and
judgment
and
in
the
summing
up
there
was
always
the
clearest
possible
statement
of
the
whole
matter
what
finally
emerged
was
a
body
of
doctrine
that
came
i
believe
very
close
to
the
truth
into
an
assembly
of
national
critics
who
had
long
wallowed
in
dogmatic
puerilities
huneker
entered
with
a
taste
infinitely
surer
and
more
civilized
a
learning
infinitely
greater
and
an
address
infinitely
more
engaging
no
man
was
less
the
reformer
by
inclination
and
yet
he
became
a
reformer
beyond
compare
he
emancipated
criticism
in
america
from
its
old
slavery
to
stupidity
and
with
it
he
emancipated
all
the
arts
themselves
iii
footnote
on
criticism
nearly
all
the
discussions
of
criticism
that
i
am
acquainted
with
start
off
with
a
false
assumption
to
wit
that
the
primary
motive
of
the
critic
the
impulse
which
makes
a
critic
of
him
instead
of
say
a
politician
or
a
stockbroker
is
pedagogical
that
he
writes
because
he
is
possessed
by
a
passion
to
advance
the
enlightenment
to
put
down
error
and
wrong
to
disseminate
some
specific
doctrine
psychological
epistemological
historical
or
æsthetic
this
is
true
it
seems
to
me
only
of
bad
critics
and
its
degree
of
truth
increases
in
direct
ratio
to
their
badness
the
motive
of
the
critic
who
is
really
worth
reading
the
only
critic
of
whom
indeed
it
may
be
said
truthfully
that
it
is
at
all
possible
to
read
him
save
as
an
act
of
mental
discipline
is
something
quite
different
that
motive
is
not
the
motive
of
the
pedagogue
but
the
motive
of
the
artist
it
is
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
simple
desire
to
function
freely
and
beautifully
to
give
outward
and
objective
form
to
ideas
that
bubble
inwardly
and
have
a
fascinating
lure
in
them
to
get
rid
of
them
dramatically
and
make
an
articulate
noise
in
the
world
it
was
for
this
reason
that
plato
wrote
the
republic
and
for
this
reason
that
beethoven
wrote
the
ninth
symphony
and
it
is
for
this
reason
to
drop
a
million
miles
that
i
am
writing
the
present
essay
everything
else
is
afterthought
messianic
delusion
in
brief
affectation
and
folly
is
the
contrary
conception
of
criticism
widely
cherished
is
it
almost
universally
held
that
the
thing
is
a
brother
to
jurisprudence
advertising
laparotomy
chautauqua
lecturing
and
the
art
of
the
schoolmarm
then
certainly
the
fact
that
it
is
so
held
should
be
sufficient
to
set
up
an
overwhelming
probability
of
its
lack
of
truth
and
sense
if
i
speak
with
some
heat
it
is
as
one
who
has
suffered
when
years
ago
i
devoted
myself
diligently
to
critical
pieces
upon
the
writings
of
theodore
dreiser
i
found
that
practically
every
one
who
took
any
notice
of
my
proceedings
at
all
fell
into
either
one
of
two
assumptions
about
my
underlying
purpose
a
that
i
had
a
fanatical
devotion
for
dreiser
ideas
and
desired
to
propagate
them
or
b
that
i
was
an
ardent
patriot
and
yearned
to
lift
up
american
literature
both
assumptions
were
false
i
had
then
and
i
have
now
very
little
interest
in
many
of
dreiser
main
ideas
when
we
meet
in
fact
we
usually
quarrel
about
them
and
i
am
wholly
devoid
of
public
spirit
and
have
the
least
lust
to
improve
american
literature
if
it
ever
came
to
what
i
regard
as
perfection
my
job
would
be
gone
what
then
was
my
motive
in
writing
about
dreiser
so
copiously
my
motive
well
known
to
dreiser
himself
and
to
every
one
else
who
knew
me
as
intimately
as
he
did
was
simply
and
solely
to
sort
out
and
give
coherence
to
the
ideas
of
mencken
and
to
put
them
into
suave
and
ingratiating
terms
and
to
discharge
them
with
a
flourish
and
maybe
with
a
phrase
of
pretty
song
into
the
dense
fog
that
blanketed
the
republic
the
critic
choice
of
criticism
rather
than
of
what
is
called
creative
writing
is
chiefly
a
matter
of
temperament
perhaps
more
accurately
of
hormones
with
accidents
of
education
and
environment
to
help
the
feelings
that
happen
to
be
dominant
in
him
at
the
moment
the
scribbling
frenzy
seizes
him
are
feelings
inspired
not
directly
by
life
itself
but
by
books
pictures
music
sculpture
architecture
religion
philosophy
in
brief
by
some
other
man
feelings
about
life
they
are
thus
in
a
sense
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
creative
artists
so
easily
fall
into
the
theory
that
they
are
also
perhaps
they
usually
are
if
indeed
the
critic
continues
on
this
plane
if
he
lacks
the
intellectual
agility
and
enterprise
needed
to
make
the
leap
from
the
work
of
art
to
the
vast
and
mysterious
complex
of
phenomena
behind
it
then
they
are
and
he
remains
no
more
than
a
fugelman
or
policeman
to
his
betters
but
if
a
genuine
artist
is
conceded
within
him
if
his
feelings
are
in
any
sense
profound
and
original
and
his
capacity
for
is
above
the
average
of
educated
men
then
he
moves
inevitably
from
the
work
of
art
to
life
itself
and
begins
to
take
on
a
dignity
that
he
formerly
lacked
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
a
man
of
any
actual
force
and
originality
universally
recognized
as
having
those
qualities
who
spent
his
whole
life
appraising
and
describing
the
work
of
other
men
did
goethe
or
carlyle
or
matthew
arnold
or
or
macaulay
or
even
to
come
down
a
few
pegs
lewes
or
lowell
or
hazlitt
certainly
not
the
thing
that
becomes
most
obvious
about
the
writings
of
all
such
men
once
they
are
examined
carefully
is
that
the
critic
is
always
being
swallowed
up
by
the
creative
artist
that
what
starts
out
as
the
review
of
a
book
or
a
play
or
other
work
of
art
usually
develops
very
quickly
into
an
independent
essay
upon
the
theme
of
that
work
of
art
or
upon
some
theme
that
it
suggests
in
a
word
that
it
becomes
a
fresh
work
of
art
and
only
indirectly
related
to
the
one
that
suggested
it
this
fact
indeed
is
so
plain
that
it
scarcely
needs
statement
what
the
pedagogues
always
object
to
in
for
example
the
reviewers
is
that
they
forgot
the
books
they
were
supposed
to
review
and
wrote
long
papers
often
in
fact
small
books
expounding
ideas
suggested
or
not
suggested
by
the
books
under
review
every
critic
who
is
worth
reading
falls
inevitably
into
the
same
habit
he
can
not
stick
to
his
task
what
is
before
him
is
always
infinitely
less
interesting
to
him
than
what
is
within
him
if
he
is
genuinely
if
what
is
within
him
stands
the
test
of
type
and
wins
an
audience
and
produces
the
reactions
that
every
artist
craves
then
he
usually
ends
by
abandoning
the
criticism
of
specific
works
of
art
altogether
and
setting
up
shop
as
a
general
merchant
in
general
ideas
as
an
artist
working
in
the
materials
of
life
itself
mere
reviewing
however
conscientiously
and
competently
it
is
done
is
plainly
a
much
inferior
business
like
writing
poetry
it
is
chiefly
a
function
of
intellectual
immaturity
the
young
literatus
just
out
of
the
university
having
as
yet
no
capacity
for
grappling
with
the
fundamental
mysteries
of
existence
is
put
to
writing
reviews
of
books
or
plays
or
music
or
painting
very
often
he
does
it
extremely
well
it
is
in
fact
not
hard
to
do
well
for
even
decayed
pedagogues
often
do
it
as
such
graves
of
the
intellect
as
the
new
york
bear
witness
but
if
he
continues
to
do
it
whether
well
or
ill
it
is
a
sign
to
all
the
world
that
his
growth
ceased
when
they
made
him
gradually
he
becomes
whether
in
or
out
of
the
academic
grove
a
professor
which
is
to
say
a
man
devoted
to
diluting
and
retailing
the
ideas
of
his
superiors
not
an
artist
not
even
a
bad
artist
but
almost
the
antithesis
of
an
artist
he
is
learned
he
is
sober
he
is
painstaking
and
accurate
but
he
is
as
hollow
as
a
jug
nothing
is
in
him
save
the
ghostly
echoes
of
other
men
thoughts
and
feelings
if
he
were
a
genuine
artist
he
would
have
thoughts
and
feelings
of
his
own
and
the
impulse
to
give
them
objective
form
would
be
irresistible
an
artist
can
no
more
withstand
that
impulse
than
a
politician
can
withstand
the
temptations
of
a
job
there
are
no
mute
inglorious
miltons
save
in
the
hallucinations
of
poets
the
one
sound
test
of
a
milton
is
that
he
functions
as
a
milton
his
difference
from
other
men
lies
precisely
in
the
superior
vigor
of
his
impulse
to
not
in
the
superior
beauty
and
loftiness
of
his
ideas
other
men
in
point
of
fact
often
have
the
same
ideas
or
perhaps
even
loftier
ones
but
they
are
able
to
suppress
them
usually
on
grounds
of
decorum
and
so
they
escape
being
artists
and
are
respected
by
persons
and
die
with
money
in
the
bank
and
are
forgotten
in
two
weeks
obviously
the
critic
whose
performance
we
are
commonly
called
upon
to
investigate
is
a
man
standing
somewhere
along
the
path
leading
from
the
beginning
that
i
have
described
to
the
goal
he
has
got
beyond
being
a
mere
cataloguer
and
valuer
of
other
men
ideas
but
he
has
not
yet
become
an
autonomous
artist
he
is
not
yet
ready
to
challenge
attention
with
his
own
ideas
alone
but
it
is
plain
that
his
motion
in
so
far
as
he
is
moving
at
all
must
be
in
the
direction
of
that
autonomy
that
is
unless
one
imagines
him
sliding
backward
into
senile
infantilism
a
spectacle
not
unknown
to
literary
pathology
but
too
pathetic
to
be
discussed
here
bear
this
motion
in
mind
and
the
true
nature
of
his
aims
and
purposes
becomes
clear
more
the
incurable
falsity
of
the
aims
and
purposes
usually
credited
to
him
becomes
equally
clear
he
is
not
actually
trying
to
perform
an
impossible
act
of
arctic
justice
upon
the
artist
whose
work
gives
him
a
text
he
is
not
trying
with
mathematical
passion
to
find
out
exactly
what
was
in
that
mind
at
the
moment
of
creation
and
to
display
it
precisely
and
in
an
ecstasy
of
appreciation
he
is
not
trying
to
bring
the
work
discussed
into
accord
with
some
transient
theory
of
æsthetics
or
ethics
or
truth
or
to
determine
its
degree
of
departure
from
that
theory
he
is
not
trying
to
lift
up
the
fine
arts
or
to
defend
democracy
against
sense
or
to
promote
happiness
at
the
domestic
hearth
or
to
convert
sophomores
into
or
to
serve
god
he
is
not
trying
to
fit
a
group
of
novel
phenomena
into
the
orderly
process
of
history
he
is
not
even
trying
to
discharge
the
catalytic
office
that
i
myself
in
a
romantic
moment
once
sought
to
force
upon
him
he
is
first
and
last
simply
trying
to
express
himself
he
is
trying
to
arrest
and
challenge
a
sufficient
body
of
readers
to
make
them
pay
attention
to
him
to
impress
them
with
the
charm
and
novelty
of
his
ideas
to
provoke
them
into
an
agreeable
or
shocked
awareness
of
him
and
he
is
trying
to
achieve
thereby
for
his
own
inner
ego
the
grateful
feeling
of
a
function
performed
a
tension
relieved
a
attained
which
wagner
achieved
when
he
wrote
die
walküre
and
a
hen
achieves

joseph

bach

to

music
poets
are
moved
to
write
poetry
critics
are
moved
to
write
criticism
the
form
is
nothing
the
only
important
thing
is
the
motive
power
and
it
is
the
same
in
all
cases
it
is
the
pressing
yearning
of
every
man
who
has
ideas
in
him
to
empty
them
upon
the
world
to
hammer
them
into
plausible
and
ingratiating
shapes
to
compel
the
attention
and
respect
of
his
equals
to
lord
it
over
his
inferiors
so
seen
the
critic
becomes
a
far
more
transparent
and
agreeable
fellow
than
ever
he
was
in
the
discourses
of
the
psychologists
who
sought
to
make
him
a
mere
appraiser
in
an
intellectual
customs
house
a
gauger
in
a
distillery
of
the
spirit
a
just
and
infallible
judge
upon
the
cosmic
bench
such
offices
in
point
of
fact
never
fit
him
he
always
bulges
over
their
confines
so
labelled
and
estimated
it
inevitably
turns
out
that
the
specific
critic
under
examination
is
a
very
bad
one
or
no
critic
at
all
but
when
he
is
thought
of
not
as
pedagogue
but
as
artist
then
he
begins
to
take
on
reality
and
what
is
more
dignity
carlyle
was
surely
no
just
and
infallible
judge
on
the
contrary
he
was
full
of
prejudices
biles
naïvetés
humors
yet
he
is
read
consulted
attended
to
macaulay
was
unfair
inaccurate
fanciful
lyrical
yet
his
essays
live
arnold
had
his
faults
too
and
so
did
and
so
did
goethe
and
so
did
many
another
of
that
line
and
yet
they
are
remembered
and
all
the
learned
and
conscientious
critics
of
their
time
laboriously
concerned
with
the
precise
intent
of
the
artists
under
review
and
passionately
determined
to
set
it
forth
with
care
and
to
relate
it
exactly
to
this
or
that
great
stream
of
ideas
all
these
pedants
are
forgotten
what
saved
carlyle
macaulay
and
company
is
as
plain
as
day
they
were
artists
they
could
make
the
thing
charming
and
that
is
always
a
million
times
more
important
than
making
it
true
truth
indeed
is
something
that
is
believed
in
completely
only
by
persons
who
have
never
tried
personally
to
pursue
it
to
its
fastnesses
and
grab
it
by
the
tail
it
is
the
adoration
of
men
men
who
always
receive
it
at
pedagogues
believe
in
immutable
truths
and
spend
their
lives
trying
to
determine
them
and
propagate
them
the
intellectual
progress
of
man
consists
largely
of
a
concerted
effort
to
block
and
destroy
their
enterprise
nine
times
out
of
ten
in
the
arts
as
in
life
there
is
actually
no
truth
to
be
discovered
there
is
only
error
to
be
exposed
in
whole
departments
of
human
inquiry
it
seems
to
me
quite
unlikely
that
the
truth
ever
be
discovered
nevertheless
the
thinking
of
the
world
always
makes
the
assumption
that
the
exposure
of
an
error
is
identical
with
the
discovery
of
the
truth
that
error
and
truth
are
simple
opposites
they
are
nothing
of
the
sort
what
the
world
turns
to
when
it
has
been
cured
of
one
error
is
usually
simply
another
error
and
maybe
one
worse
than
the
first
one
this
is
the
whole
history
of
the
intellect
in
brief
the
average
man
of
does
not
believe
in
precisely
the
same
imbecilities
that
the
greek
of
the
fourth
century
before
christ
believed
in
but
the
things
that
he
believe
in
are
often
quite
as
idiotic
perhaps
this
statement
is
a
bit
too
sweeping
there
is
year
by
year
a
gradual
accumulation
of
what
may
be
called
provisionally
truths
there
is
a
slow
accretion
of
ideas
that
somehow
manage
to
meet
all
practicable
human
tests
and
so
survive
but
even
so
it
is
risky
to
call
them
absolute
truths
all
that
one
may
safely
say
of
them
is
that
no
one
as
yet
has
demonstrated
that
they
are
errors
soon
or
late
if
experience
teaches
us
anything
they
are
likely
to
succumb
too
the
profoundest
truths
of
the
middle
ages
are
now
laughed
at
by
schoolboys
the
profoundest
truths
of
democracy
will
be
laughed
at
a
few
centuries
hence
even
by
in
the
department
of
æsthetics
wherein
critics
mainly
disport
themselves
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
of
a
truth
that
shows
any
sign
of
being
permanently
true
the
most
profound
of
principles
begins
to
fade
and
quiver
almost
as
soon
as
it
is
stated
but
the
work
of
art
as
opposed
to
the
theory
behind
it
has
a
longer
life
particularly
if
that
theory
be
obscure
and
questionable
and
so
can
not
be
determined
accurately

these
things
so
baffling
to
pedagogy
so
contumacious
to
the
categories
so
mysterious
in
purpose
and
utility
these
things
live
and
why
because
there
is
in
them
the
flavor
of
salient
novel
and
attractive
personality
because
the
quality
that
shines
from
them
is
not
that
of
correct
demeanor
but
that
of
creative
passion
because
they
pulse
and
breathe
and
speak
because
they
are
genuine
works
of
art
so
with
criticism
let
us
forget
all
the
heavy
effort
to
make
a
science
of
it
it
is
a
fine
art
or
nothing
if
the
critic
retiring
to
his
cell
to
concoct
his
treatise
upon
a
book
or
play
or
produces
a
piece
of
writing
that
shows
sound
structure
and
brilliant
color
and
the
flash
of
new
and
persuasive
ideas
and
civilized
manners
and
the
charm
of
an
uncommon
personality
in
free
function
then
he
has
given
something
to
the
world
that
is
worth
having
and
sufficiently
justified
his
existence
is

true
who

let
the
critic
who
is
an

leave
such
necropsies
to
professors
of
æsthetics
who
can
no
more
determine
the
truth
than
he
can
and
will
infallibly
make
it
unpleasant
and
a
bore
it
is
of
course
not
easy
to
practice
this
abstention
two
forces
one
within
and
one
without
tend
to
bring
even
a
hazlitt
or
a
huneker
under
the
campus
pump
one
is
the
almost
universal
human
susceptibility
to
messianic
delusions
the
irresistible
tendency
of
practically
every
man
once
he
finds
a
crowd
in
front
of
him
to
strut
and
roll
his
eyes
the
other
is
the
public
demand
born
of
such
long
familiarity
with
pedagogical
criticism
that
no
other
kind
is
readily
conceivable
that
the
critic
teach
something
as
well
as
say
something
in
the
popular
phrase
that
he
be
constructive
both
operate
powerfully
against
his
free
functioning
and
especially
the
former
he
finds
it
hard
to
resist
the
flattery
of
his
customers
however
little
he
may
actually
esteem
it
if
he
knows
anything
at
all
he
knows
that
his
following
like
that
of
every
other
artist
in
ideas
is
chiefly
made
up
of
the
congenitally
subaltern
type
of
man
and
woman
natural
converts
lodge
joiners
stragglers
after
circus
parades
it
is
precious
seldom
that
he
ever
gets
a
positive
idea
out
of
them
what
he
usually
gets
is
mere
unintelligent
ratification
but
this
troop
despite
its
obvious
failings
corrupts
him
in
various
ways
for
one
thing
it
enormously
reënforces
his
belief
in
his
own
ideas
and
so
tends
to
make
him
stiff
and
dogmatic
in
brief
precisely
everything
that
he
ought
not
to
be
and
for
another
thing
it
tends
to
make
him
by
a
curious
contradiction
a
bit
pliant
and
politic
he
begins
to
estimate
new
ideas
not
in
proportion
as
they
are
amusing
or
beautiful
but
in
proportion
as
they
are
likely
to
please
so
beset
front
and
rear
he
sometimes
sinks
supinely
to
the
level
of
a
professor
and
his
subsequent
proceedings
are
interesting
no
more
the
true
aim
of
a
critic
is
certainly
not
to
make
converts
he
must
know
that
very
few
of
the
persons
who
are
susceptible
to
conversion
are
worth
converting
their
minds
are
intrinsically
flabby
and
parasitical
and
it
is
certainly
not
sound
sport
to
agitate
minds
of
that
sort
moreover
the
critic
must
always
harbor
a
grave
doubt
about
most
of
the
ideas
that
they
lap
up
so
greedily
it
must
occur
to
him
not
infrequently
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
that
much
that
he
writes
is
sheer
buncombe
as
i
have
said
i
ca
imagine
any
idea
that
is
in
the
domain
of
æsthetics
that
is
palpably
and
incontrovertibly
sound
all
that
i
am
familiar
with
and
in
particular
all
that
i
announce
most
vociferously
seem
to
me
to
contain
a
core
of
quite
obvious
nonsense
i
thus
try
to
avoid
cherishing
them
too
lovingly
and
it
always
gives
me
a
shiver
to
see
any
one
else
gobble
them
at
one
gulp
criticism
at
bottom
is
indistinguishable
from
skepticism
both
launch
themselves
the
one
by
æsthetic
presentations
and
the
other
by
logical
presentations
at
the
common
human
tendency
to
accept
whatever
is
approved
to
take
in
ideas
to
be
responsive
to
mere
rhetoric
and
gesticulation
a
critic
who
believes
in
anything
absolutely
is
bound
to
that
something
quite
as
helplessly
as
a
christian
is
bound
to
the
freudian
garbage
in
the
book
of
revelation
to
that
extent
at
all
events
he
is
unfree
and
unintelligent
and
hence
a
bad
critic
the
demand
for
constructive
criticism
is
based
upon
the
same
false
assumption
that
immutable
truths
exist
in
the
arts
and
that
the
artist
will
be
improved
by
being
made
aware
of
them
this
notion
whatever
the
form
it
takes
is
always
absurd
as
much
so
indeed
as
its
brother
delusion
that
the
critic
to
be
competent
must
be
a
practitioner
of
the
specific
art
he
ventures
to
deal
with
that
a
doctor
to
cure
a
must
have
a
as
practically
encountered
it
is
disingenuous
as
well
as
absurd
for
it
comes
chiefly
from
bad
artists
who
tire
of
serving
as
performing
monkeys
and
crave
the
greater
ease
and
safety
of
sophomores
in
class
they
demand
to
be
taught
in
order
to
avoid
being
knocked
about
in
their
demand
is
the
theory
that
instruction
if
they
could
get
it
would
profit
them
that
they
are
capable
of
doing
better
work
than
they
do
as
a
practical
matter
i
doubt
that
this
is
ever
true
bad
poets
never
actually
grow
any
better
they
invariably
grow
worse
and
worse
in
all
history
there
has
never
been
to
my
knowledge
a
single
practitioner
of
any
art
who
as
a
result
of
constructive
criticism
improved
his
work
the
curse
of
all
the
arts
indeed
is
the
fact
that
they
are
constantly
invaded
by
persons
who
are
not
artists
at
all
persons
whose
yearning
to
express
their
ideas
and
feelings
is
unaccompanied
by
the
slightest
capacity
for
charming
expression
in
brief
persons
with
absolutely
nothing
to
say
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
art
of
letters
which
interposes
very
few
technical
obstacles
to
the
vanity
and
garrulity
of
such
invaders
any
effort
to
teach
them
to
write
better
is
an
effort
wasted
as
every
editor
discovers
for
himself
they
are
as
incapable
of
it
as
they
are
of
jumping
over
the
moon
the
only
sort
of
criticism
that
can
deal
with
them
to
any
profit
is
the
sort
that
employs
them
frankly
as
laboratory
animals
it
can
not
cure
them
but
it
can
at
least
make
an
amusing
and
perhaps
edifying
show
of
them
it
is
idle
to
argue
that
the
good
in
them
is
thus
destroyed
with
the
bad
the
simple
answer
is
that
there
no
good
in
them
suppose
poe
had
wasted
his
time
trying
to
dredge
good
work
out
of
rufus
dawes
author
of
geraldine
he
would
have
failed
miserably
and
spoiled
a
capital
essay
still
diverting
after
of
a
century
suppose
beethoven
dealing
with
gottfried
weber
had
tried
laboriously
to
make
an
intelligent
music
critic
of
him
how
much
more
apt
useful
and
durable
the
simple
note
ass
here
was
absolutely
sound
criticism
here
was
a
judgment
wholly
beyond
challenge
moreover
here
was
a
small
but
perfect
work
of
art
upon
the
low
practical
value
of
constructive
criticism
i
can
offer
testimony
out
of
my
own
experience
my
books
are
commonly
reviewed
at
great
length
and
many
critics
devote
themselves
to
pointing
out
what
they
conceive
to
be
my
errors
both
of
fact
and
of
taste
well
i
can
not
recall
a
case
in
which
any
suggestion
offered
by
a
constructive
critic
has
helped
me
in
the
slightest
or
even
actively
interested
me
every
such
of
letters
has
sought
fatuously
to
make
me
write
in
a
way
differing
from
that
in
which
the
lord
god
almighty
in
his
infinite
wisdom
impels
me
to
write
that
is
to
make
me
write
stuff
which
coming
from
me
would
be
as
false
as
an
appearance
of
decency
in
a
congressman
all
the
benefits
i
have
ever
got
from
the
critics
of
my
work
have
come
from
the
destructive
variety
a
hearty
slating
always
does
me
good
particularly
if
it
be
well
written
it
begins
by
enlisting
my
professional
respect
it
ends
by
making
me
examine
my
ideas
coldly
in
the
privacy
of
my
chamber
not
of
course
that
i
usually
revise
them
but
i
at
least
examine
them
if
i
decide
to
hold
fast
to
them
they
are
all
the
dearer
to
me
thereafter
and
i
expound
them
with
a
new
passion
and
plausibility
if
on
the
contrary
i
discern
holes
in
them
i
shelve
them
in
a
manner
and
set
about
hatching
new
ones
to
take
their
place
but
constructive
criticism
irritates
me
i
do
not
object
to
being
denounced
but
i
ca
abide
being
especially
by
men
i
regard
as
imbeciles
i
find
as
a
practicing
critic
that
very
few
men
who
write
books
are
even
as
tolerant
as
i
am
that
most
of
them
soon
or
late
show
signs
of
extreme
discomfort
under
criticism
however
polite
its
terms
perhaps
this
is
why
enduring
friendships
between
authors
and
critics
are
so
rare
all
artists
of
course
dislike
one
another
more
or
less
but
that
dislike
seldom
rises
to
implacable
enmity
save
between
opera
singer
and
opera
singer
and
creative
author
and
critic
even
when
the
latter
two
keep
up
an
outward
show
of
there
is
always
bitter
antagonism
under
the
surface
part
of
it
i
daresay
arises
out
of
the
impossible
demands
of
the
critic
particularly
if
he
be
tinged
with
the
constructive
madness
having
favored
an
author
with
his
good
opinion
he
expects
the
poor
fellow
to
live
up
to
that
good
opinion
without
the
slightest
compromise
or
faltering
and
this
is
commonly
beyond
human
power
he
feels
that
any
compromises
that
his
hero
is
stabbing
him
in
the
back
and
making
him
ridiculous
and
this
feeling
rasps
his
vanity
the
most
bitter
of
all
literary
quarrels
are
those
between
critics
and
creative
artists
and
most
of
them
arise
in
just
this
way
as
for
the
creative
artist
he
on
his
part
naturally
resents
the
critic
air
of
pedagogical
superiority
and
he
resents
it
especially
when
he
has
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
has
fallen
short
of
his
best
work
and
that
the
discontent
of
the
critic
is
thus
justified
injustice
is
relatively
easy
to
bear
what
stings
is
justice
under
it
all
of
course
lurks
the
fact
that
i
began
with
the
fact
that
the
critic
is
himself
an
artist
and
that
his
creative
impulse
soon
or
late
is
bound
to
make
him
neglect
the
punctilio
when
he
sits
down
to
compose
his
criticism
his
artist
ceases
to
be
a
friend
and
becomes
mere
raw
material
for
his
work
of
art
it
is
my
experience
that
artists
invariably
resent
this
cavalier
use
of
them
they
are
pleased
so
long
as
the
critic
confines
himself
to
the
modest
business
of
interpreting
them
preferably
in
terms
of
their
own
estimate
of
themselves
but
the
moment
he
proceeds
to
adorn
their
theme
with
variations
of
his
own
the
moment
he
brings
new
ideas
to
the
enterprise
and
begins
contrasting
them
with
their
ideas
that
moment
they
grow
restive
it
is
precisely
at
this
point
of
course
that
criticism
becomes
genuine
criticism
before
that
it
was
mere
reviewing
when
a
critic
passes
it
he
loses
his
friends
by
becoming
an
artist
he
becomes
the
foe
of
all
other
artists
but
the
transformation
i
believe
has
good
effects
upon
him
it
makes
him
a
better
critic
too
much
is
as
fatal
to
criticism
as
it
would
be
to
surgery
or
politics
when
it
rages
unimpeded
it
leads
inevitably
either
to
a
dull
professorial
sticking
on
of
meaningless
labels
or
to
and
often
it
leads
to
both
one
of
the
most
hopeful
symptoms
of
the
new
in
the
republic
is
the
revival
of
acrimony
in
criticism
the
renaissance
of
the
doctrine
that
æsthetic
matters
are
important
and
that
it
is
worth
the
while
of
a
healthy
male
to
take
them
seriously
as
he
takes
business
sport
and
amour
in
the
days
when
american
literature
was
showing
its
first
vigorous
growth
the
native
criticism
was
extraordinarily
violent
and
even
vicious
in
the
days
when
american
literature
swooned
upon
the
tomb
of
the
puritan
it
became
flaccid
and
childish
the
typical
critic
of
the
first
era
was
poe
as
the
typical
critic
of
the
second
was
howells
poe
carried
on
his
critical
jehads
with
such
ferocity
that
he
often
got
into
and
sometimes
ran
no
little
risk
of
having
his
head
cracked
he
regarded
literary
questions
as
exigent
and
momentous
the
lofty
aloofness
of
the
don
was
simply
not
in
him
when
he
encountered
a
book
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
bad
he
attacked
it
almost
as
sharply
as
a
chamber
of
commerce
would
attack
a
fanatic
preaching
free
speech
or
the
corporation
of
trinity
church
would
attack
christ
his
opponents
replied
in
the
same
berserker
manner
much
of
poe
surviving
as
a
drunkard
and
is
due
to
their
inordinate
denunciations
of
him
they
were
not
content
to
refute
him
they
constantly
tried
to
dispose
of
him
altogether
the
very
ferocity
of
that
ancient
row
shows
that
the
native
literature
in
those
days
was
in
a
healthy
state
books
of
genuine
value
were
produced
literature
always
thrives
best
in
fact
in
an
atmosphere
of
hearty
strife
poe
surrounded
by
admiring
professors
never
challenged
never
aroused
to
the
emotions
of
revolt
would
probably
have
written
poetry
indistinguishable
from
the
hollow
stuff
of
say
george
woodberry
it
took
the
persistent
and
often
grossly
unfair
and
dishonorable
opposition
of
griswold
to
stimulate
him
to
his
highest
endeavors
he
needed
friends
true
enough
but
he
also
needed
enemies
for
the
first
time
in
years
there
is
strife
in
american
criticism
and
the
paul
elmer
mores
and
hamilton
wright
mabies
are
no
longer
able
to
purr
in
peace
the
instant
they
fall
into
stiff
professorial
attitudes
they
are
challenged
and
often
with
anything
but
urbanity
the
manner
thus
passes
out
and
free
discussion
comes
in
heretics
lay
on
boldly
and
the
professors
are
forced
to
make
some
defense
often
going
further
they
attempt
ears
are
bitten
off
noses
are
bloodied
there
are
wallops
both
above
and
below
the
belt
i
am
i
need
not
say
no
believer
in
any
magical
merit
in
debate
no
matter
how
free
it
may
be
it
certainly
does
not
necessarily
establish
the
truth
both
sides
in
fact
may
be
wrong
and
they
often
are
but
it
at
least
accomplishes
two
important
effects
on
the
one
hand
it
exposes
all
the
cruder
fallacies
to
hostile
examination
and
so
disposes
of
many
of
them
and
on
the
other
hand
it
melodramatizes
the
business
of
the
critic
and
so
convinces
thousands
of
bystanders
otherwise
quite
inert
that
criticism
is
an
amusing
and
instructive
art
and
that
the
problems
it
deals
with
are
important
what
men
will
fight
for
seems
to
be
worth
looking
into
iv
das
kapital
after
a
hearty
dinner
of
créole
planked
chesapeake
shad
guinea
hen
and
some
respectable
salad
with
two
or
three
cocktails
made
of
gin
vermouth
and
a
dash
of
absinthe
as
and
a
bottle
of
ruhländer
to
wash
it
down
the
following
thought
often
bubbles
up
from
my
subconscious
that
many
of
the
acknowledged
evils
of
capitalism
now
so
horribly
visible
in
the
world
are
not
due
primarily
to
capitalism
itself
but
rather
to
democracy
that
universal
murrain
of
christendom
what
i
mean
in
brief
is
that
capitalism
under
democracy
is
constantly
under
hostile
pressure
and
often
has
its
back
to
the
wall
and
that
its
barbaric
manners
and
morals
at
least
in
large
part
are
due
to
that
fact
that
they
are
in
essence
precisely
the
same
manners
and
morals
that
are
displayed
by
any
other
creature
or
institution
so
beset
necessity
is
not
only
the
mother
of
invention
it
is
also
the
mother
of
every
imaginable
excess
and
infamy
a
woman
defending
her
child
is
notoriously
willing
to
go
to
lengths
that
even
a
turk
or
an
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
would
regard
as
inordinate
and
so
is
a
presbyterian
defending
his
hell
or
a
soldier
defending
his
fatherland
or
a
banker
defending
his
gold
it
is
only
when
there
is
no
danger
that
the
average
human
being
is
honorable
just
as
it
is
only
when
there
danger
that
he
is
virtuous
he
would
commit
adultery
every
day
if
it
were
safe
and
he
would
commit
murder
every
day
if
it
were
necessary
the
essential
thing
about
democracy
as
every
one
must
know
is
that
it
is
a
device
for
strengthening
and
heartening
the
in
their
eternal
war
upon
the
haves
that
war
as
every
one
knows
again
has
its
psychological
springs
in
envy
pure
and
simple
envy
of
the
more
fortunate
man
greater
wealth
the
superior
pulchritude
of
his
wife
or
wives
his
larger
mobility
and
freedom
his
more
protean
capacity
for
and
command
of
happiness
in
brief
his
better
chance
to
lead
a
bearable
life
in
this
worst
of
possible
worlds
it
follows
that
under
democracy
which
gives
a
false
power
and
importance
to
the
by
counting
every
one
of
them
as
the
legal
equal
of
george
washington
or
beethoven
the
process
of
government
consists
largely
and
sometimes
almost
exclusively
of
efforts
to
spoil
that
advantage
artificially
free
silver
direct
elections
prohibition
government
ownership
and
all
the
other
varieties
of
american
political
quackery
are
but
symptoms
of
the
same
general
rage
it
is
the
rage
of
the
against
the
have
of
the
farmer
who
must
drink
hard
cider
and
against
the
city
man
who
may
drink
burgundy
and
scotch
of
the
poor
fellow
who
must
stay
at
home
looking
at
a
wife
who
regards
the
as
lewd
and
lascivious
against
the
lucky
fellow
who
may
go
to
atlantic
city
or
palm
beach
and
ride
up
and
down
in
a
with
a
girl
who
knows
how
to
make
up
and
has
put
away
the
fear
of
god
the
ignobler
sort
of
men
of
course
are
too
stupid
to
understand
various
rare
and
exhilarating
sorts
of
superiority
and
so
they
do
not
envy
the
happiness
that
goes
with
them
if
they
could
enter
into
the
mind
of
a
wagner
or
a
brahms
and
begin
to
comprehend
the
stupendous
joy
that
such
a
man
gets
out
of
the
practice
of
his
art
they
would
pass
laws
against
it
and
make
a
criminal
of
him
as
they
have
already
made
criminals
in
the
united
states
of
the
man
with
a
civilized
taste
for
wines
the
man
so
attractive
to
women
that
he
can
get
all
the
wives
he
wants
without
having
to
marry
them
and
the
man
who
can
make
pictures
like
félicien
rops
or
books
like
flaubert
zola
dreiser
cabell
or
rabelais
wagner
and
brahms
escape
and
their
arts
with
them
because
the
great
masses
of
men
can
not
understand
the
sort
of
thing
they
try
to
do
and
hence
do
not
envy
the
man
who
does
it
well
and
gets
joy
out
of
it
it
is
much
different
with
say
rops
every
american
congressman
as
a
small
boy
covered
the
fence
of
the
yard
with
pictures
in
the
manner
of
rops
what
he
now
remembers
of
the
business
is
that
the
pictures
were
denounced
by
the
superintendent
and
that
he
was
cowhided
for
making
them
what
he
hears
about
rops
when
he
hears
at
all
is
that
the
fellow
is
vastly
esteemed
and
hence
probably
full
of
a
smug
æsthetic
satisfaction
in
consequence
it
is
unlawful
in
the
united
states
to
transmit
the
principal
pictures
of
rops
by
mail
or
indeed
to
have
and
possess
them
the
man
who
owns
them
must
conceal
them
from
the
of
the
department
of
justice
just
as
carefully
as
he
conceals
the
wines
and
whiskeys
in
his
cellar
or
the
poor
working
girl
he
transports
from
the
heat
and
noise
of
new
york
to
the
salubrious
calm
of
the
jersey
coast
or
his
library
set
of
the
contes
drôlatiques
or
his
precious
first
edition
of
jurgen
but
as
i
say
the
democratic
pressure
in
such
directions
is
relatively
feeble
for
there
are
whole
categories
of
more
or
less
æsthetic
superiority
and
happiness
that
the
democrat
can
not
understand
at
all
and
is
in
consequence
virtually
unaware
of
it
is
far
different
with
the
varieties
of
superiority
and
happiness
that
are
the
functions
of
mere
money
here
the
democrat
is
extraordinarily
alert
and
appreciative
he
can
not
only
imagine
hundreds
of
ways
of
getting
happiness
out
of
money
he
devotes
almost
the
whole
of
his
intellectual
activity
such
as
it
is
to
imagining
them
and
he
seldom
if
ever
imagines
anything
else
even
his
sexual
fancies
translate
themselves
instantly
into
concepts
of
dollars
and
cents
the
thing
that
confines
him
so
miserably
to
one
wife
and
to
one
alas
so
unappetizing
and
depressing
is
simply
his
lack
of
money
if
he
only
had
the
wealth
of
diamond
jim
brady
he
too
would
be
the
glittering
don
giovanni
that
jim
was
all
the
known
species
of
democratic
political
theory
are
grounded
firmly
upon
this
doctrine
that
money
and
money
only
makes
the
mare
go
that
all
the
conceivable
varieties
of
happiness
are
possible
to
the
man
who
has
it
even
the
socialists
who
profess
to
scorn
money
really
worship
it
socialism
indeed
is
simply
the
degenerate
capitalism
of
bankrupt
capitalists
its
one
genuine
object
is
to
get
more
money
for
its
professors
all
its
other
grandiloquent
objects
are
afterthoughts
and
most
of
them
are
bogus
the
democrats
of
other
schools
pursue
the
same
single
aim
and
adorn
it
with
false
pretenses
even
more
transparent
in
the
united
states
the
average
democrat
i
suppose
would
say
that
the
establishment
and
safeguarding
of
liberty
was
the
chief
purpose
of
democracy
the
theory
is
mere
wind
the
average
american
democrat
really
cares
nothing
whatever
for
liberty
and
is
always
willing
to
sell
it
for
money
what
he
actually
wants
and
strives
to
get
by
his
politics
is
more
money
his
fundamental
political
ideas
nearly
all
contemplate
restraints
and
raids
upon
capital
even
when
they
appear
superficially
to
be
quite
free
from
economic
flavor
and
most
of
the
political
banshees
and
bugaboos
that
alternately
freeze
and
boil
his
blood
have
dollar
marks
written
all
over
them
there
is
no
need
to
marshal
a
long
catalogue
of
examples
from
english
and
american
political
history
i
simply
defy
any
critic
of
my
doctrine
to
find
a
single
issue
of
genuine
appeal
to
the
populace
at
any
time
during
the
past
century
that
did
not
involve
a
more
or
less
obvious
scheme
for
looting
a
minority
the
wall
street
the
railroads
the
dukes
or
some
other
group
representing
capital
even
the
most
affecting
idealism
of
the
plain
people
has
a
thrifty
basis
in
the
united
states
during
the
early
part
of
the
late
war
they
were
very
cynical
about
the
allied
cause
it
was
not
until
the
war
orders
of
the
allies
raised
their
wages
that
they
began
to
believe
in
the
noble
righteousness
of
and
company
and
after
wilson
had
jockeyed
the
united
states
itself
into
the
war
and
the
cost
of
living
began
to
increase
faster
than
wages
he
faced
a
hostile
country
until
he
restored
altruism
by
his
wholesale
bribery
of
labor
it
is
my
contention
that
the
constant
exposure
of
capitalism
to
such
primitive
lusts
and
forays
is
what
makes
it
so
lamentably
extortionate
and
unconscionable
in
democratic
countries
and
particularly
in
the
united
states
the
capitalist
warned
by
experience
collars
all
he
can
while
the
getting
is
good
regardless
of
the
commonest
honesty
and
decorum
because
he
is
haunted
by
an
uneasy
feeling
that
his
season
will
not
be
long
his
dominating
passion
is
to
pile
up
the
largest
amount
of
capital
possible
by
fair
means
or
foul
so
that
he
will
have
ample
reserves
when
the
next
raid
comes
and
he
has
to
use
part
of
it
to
bribe
one
part
of
the
proletariat
against
the
other
in
the
long
run
of
course
he
always
wins
for
this
bribery
is
invariably
feasible
in
the
united
states
indeed
every
fresh
struggle
leaves
capital
more
secure
than
it
was
before
but
though
the
capitalist
thus
has
no
reason
to
fear
actual
defeat
and
disaster
he
is
well
aware
that
victory
is
always
expensive
and
his
natural
prudence
causes
him
to
discount
the
cost
in
advance
even
when
he
has
planned
to
shift
it
to
other
shoulders
i
point
in
example
to
the
manner
in
which
capital
dealt
with
the
discharged
american
soldiers
after
the
war
its
first
effort
was
to
cajole
them
into
its
service
as
they
had
been
cajoled
by
the
politicians
after
the
civil
war
to
this
end
it
borrowed
the
machine
erected
by
wilson
and
his
agents
for
debauching
the
booboisie
during
the
actual
war
and
by
the
skillful
use
of
that
machine
it
quickly
organized
the
late
conscripts
into
the
american
legion
alarmed
them
with
lies
about
a
bolshevist
scheme
to
make
slaves
of
them
to
cut
off
forever
their
hope
of
getting
money
and
put
them
to
clubbing
and
butchering
their
fellow
proletarians
the
business
done
the
conscripts
found
themselves
out
of
jobs
their
gallant
war
upon
bolshevism
had
brought
down
wages
and
paralysed
organized
labor
they
now
demanded
pay
for
their
work
and
capital
had
to
meet
the
demand
it
did
so
by
promising
them
a
bonus
loot
out
of
the
public
treasury
and
by
straightway
inventing
a
scheme
whereby
the
ultimate
cost
would
fall
chiefly
upon
poor
folk
throughout
the
war
indeed
capital
exhibited
an
inordinately
extortionate
spirit
and
thereby
revealed
its
underlying
dread
first
it
robbed
the
allies
in
the
manner
of
bootleggers
looting
a
country
distillery
then
it
swindled
the
plain
people
at
home
by
first
bribing
them
with
huge
wages
and
then
taking
away
all
their
profits
and
therewith
all
their
savings
and
then
it
seized
and
made
away
with
the
impounded
property
of
enemy
nationals
property
theoretically
held
in
trust
for
them
and
the
booty
if
it
was
booty
at
all
of
the
whole
american
people
this
triple
burglary
was
excessive
to
be
sure
but
who
will
say
that
it
was
not
prudent
the
capitalists
of
the
republic
are
efficient
and
have
foresight
they
saw
some
lean
and
hazardous
years
ahead
with
all
sorts
of
raids
threatening
they
took
measures
to
fortify
their
position
their
prevision
is
their
salvation
they
are
losing
some
of
their
accumulation
of
course
but
they
still
have
enough
left
to
finance
an
effective
defense
of
the
remainder
there
was
never
any
time
in
the
history
of
any
country
indeed
when
capital
was
so
securely
intrenched
as
it
is
in
the
united
states
it
has
divided
the
proletariat
into
two
bitterly
hostile
halves
it
has
battered
and
crippled
unionism
almost
beyond
recognition
it
has
a
firm
grip
upon
all
three
arms
of
the
government
and
it
controls
practically
every
agency
for
the
influencing
of
public
opinion
from
the
press
to
the
church
had
it
been
less
prudent
when
times
were
good
and
put
its
trust
in
god
alone
the
would
have
rushed
it
at
the
end
of
the
war
as
i
say
i
often
entertain
the
thought
that
it
would
be
better
in
the
long
run
to
make
terms
with
a
power
so
hard
to
resist
and
thereby
purge
it
of
its
present
compulsory
criminality
i
doubt
that
capitalists
as
a
class
are
naturally
vicious
certainly
they
are
no
more
vicious
than
say
lawyers
and
politicians
upon
whom
the
plain
people
commonly
rely
in
their
innocence
to
save
them
i
have
known
a
good
many
men
of
great
wealth
in
my
time
and
most
of
them
have
been
men
showing
all
the
customary
decencies
they
deplore
the
harsh
necessities
of
their
profession
quite
as
honestly
as
a
judge
deplores
the
harsh
necessities
of
his
you
will
never
convince
me
that
the
average
american
banker
during
the
war
got
anything
properly
describable
as
professional
satisfaction
out
of
selling
liberty
bonds
at
to
poor
stenographers
and
then
buying
them
back
at
he
knew
that
he
need
his
usurious
profit
against
the
blue
day
when
the
boys
came
home
and
so
he
took
it
but
it
would
have
given
him
ten
times
as
much
pleasure
if
it
had
come
from
the
reluctant
gizzard
of
some
other
banker
in
brief
there
is
a
pride
of
workmanship
in
capitalists
just
as
there
is
in
all
other
men
above
the
general
they
get
the
same
spiritual
lift
out
of
their
sordid
swindles
that
swinburne
got
out
of
composing
his
boozy
dithyrambs
and
i
often
incline
to
think
that
it
is
quite
as
worthy
of
respect
in
a
democratic
society
with
the
arts
adjourned
and
the
sciences
mere
concubines
of
money
it
is
chiefly
the
capitalists
in
fact
who
keep
pride
of
workmanship
alive
in
their
principal
enemies
the
it
is
almost
extinct
unionism
seldom
if
ever
uses
such
power
as
it
has
to
insure
better
work
almost
always
it
devotes
a
large
part
of
that
power
to
safeguarding
bad
work
a
union
man
who
moved
by
professional
pride
put
any
extra
effort
into
his
job
would
probably
be
punished
by
his
union
as
a
sort
of
scab
but
a
capitalist
is
still
able
to
cherish
some
of
the
old
spirit
of
the
guildsman
if
he
invents
a
new
device
for
corralling
the
money
of
those
who
have
earned
it
or
operates
an
old
device
in
some
new
and
brilliant
way
he
is
honored
and
envied
by
his
colleagues
the
late
pierpont
morgan
was
thus
honored
and
envied
not
because
he
made
more
actual
money
than
any
other
capitalist
of
his
time
in
point
of
fact
he
made
a
good
deal
less
than
some
and
his
own
son
a
much
inferior
man
has
made
more
since
his
death
than
he
did
during
his
whole
life
but
because
his
operations
showed
originality
daring
coolness
and
imagination
in
brief
because
he
was
a
great
virtuoso
in
the
art
he
practiced
what
i
contend
is
that
the
democratic
system
of
government
would
be
saner
and
more
effective
in
its
dealings
with
capital
if
it
ceased
to
regard
all
capitalists
as
criminals
facto
and
thereby
ceased
to
make
their
armed
pursuit
the
chief
end
of
practical
politics
if
it
gave
over
this
vain
effort
to
put
them
down
by
force
and
tried
to
bring
them
to
decency
by
giving
greater
play
and
confidence
to
the
pride
of
workmanship
that
i
have
described
they
would
be
less
ferocious
and
immoderate
i
think
if
they
were
treated
with
less
hostility
and
put
more
upon
their
conscience
and
honor
no
doubt
the
average
democrat
brought
up
upon
the
prevailing
superstitions
and
prejudices
of
his
faith
will
deny
at
once
that
they
are
actually
capable
of
conscience
or
honor
or
that
they
have
any
recognizable
pride
of
workmanship
well
let
him
deny
it
he
will
make
precisely
the
same
denial
with
respect
to
kings
nevertheless
it
must
be
plain
to
every
one
who
has
read
history
attentively
that
the
majority
of
the
kings
of
the
past
even
when
no
criticism
could
reach
them
showed
a
very
great
pride
of
workmanship
that
they
tried
to
be
good
kings
even
when
it
was
easier
to
be
bad
ones
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
majority
of
capitalists
the
kings
of
they
are
criminals
by
our
democratic
law
but
their
criminality
is
chiefly
artificial
and
theoretical
like
that
of
a
bootlegger
if
it
were
abolished
by
repealing
the
laws
which
create
it
if
it
became
legally
just
as
virtuous
to
organize
and
operate
a
great
industrial
corporation
or
to
combine
and
rehabilitate
railroads
or
to
finance
any
other
such
transactions
as
it
is
to
organize
a
a
or
a
lodge
of
odd
fellows
then
i
believe
that
capitalists
would
forthwith
abandon
a
great
deal
of
the
scoundrelism
which
now
marks
their
proceedings
that
they
could
be
trusted
to
police
their
order
at
least
as
vigilantly
as
physicians
or
lawyers
police
theirs
and
that
the
activities
of
those
members
of
it
who
showed
no
pride
of
workmanship
at
all
would
be
effectively
curbed
the
legal
war
upon
them
under
democracy
is
grounded
upon
the
false
assumption
that
it
would
be
possible
given
laws
enough
to
get
rid
of
them
altogether
the
who
set
the
tone
of
our
legislation
and
provided
examples
for
the
legislation
of
every
other
democratic
country
were
chiefly
what
would
be
called
bolsheviki
they
dreamed
of
a
republic
wholly
purged
of
capitalism
and
taxes
they
were
of
the
most
romantic
and
ambitious
variety
and
saw
utopia
before
them
every
man
of
their
time
who
thought
capitalistically
that
is
who
believed
that
things
consumed
had
to
be
paid
for
was
a
target
for
their
revilings
for
example
alexander
hamilton
but
they
were
wrong
and
their
modern
heirs
and
assigns
are
wrong
just
as
surely
that
wrongness
of
theirs
in
truth
has
grown
enormously
since
it
was
launched
for
the
early
americans
were
a
pastoral
people
and
could
get
along
with
very
little
capital
whereas
the
americans
of
lead
a
very
complex
life
and
need
the
aid
of
capitalism
at
almost
every
breath
they
draw
most
of
their
primary
necessities
the
railroad
the
steamship
lines
the
trolley
car
the
telephone
refrigerated
meats
clothes
phonograph
records
shows
and
so
on
are
wholly
unthinkable
save
as
the
products
of
capital
in
large
aggregations
no
man
of
can
imagine
doing
without
them
or
getting
them
without
the
aid
of
such
aggregations
the
most
even
the
wildest
socialist
can
think
of
is
to
take
the
capital
away
from
the
capitalists
who
now
have
it
and
hand
it
over
to
the
state
in
other
words
to
politicians
a
century
ago
there
were
still
plenty
of
men
who
like
thoreau
proposed
to
abolish
it
altogether
but
now
even
the
radicals
of
the
extreme
left
assume
as
a
matter
of
course
that
capital
is
indispensible
and
that
abolishing
it
or
dispersing
it
would
cause
a
collapse
of
civilization
what
ails
democracy
in
the
economic
department
is
that
it
proceeds
upon
the
assumption
that
the
contrary
is
true
that
it
seeks
to
bring
capitalism
to
a
state
of
innocuous
virtue
by
grossly
exaggerating
its
viciousness
that
it
penalizes
ignorantly
what
is
at
bottom
a
perfectly
natural
and
legitimate
aspiration
and
one
necessary
to
society
such
penalizings
i
need
not
argue
never
destroy
the
impulse
itself
surely
the
american
experience
with
prohibition
should
make
even
a
democrat
aware
of
that
what
they
do
is
simply
to
make
it
evasive
intemperate
and
relentless
if
it
were
legally
as
hazardous
in
the
united
states
to
play
a
string
quartette
as
it
is
to
build
up
a
great
bank
or
industrial
enterprise
if
the
performers
struggling
with
their
parts
had
to
watch
the
windows
in
constant
fear
that
a
bryan
a
roosevelt
a
or
some
other
such
predatory
mountebank
would
break
in
armed
with
a
club
and
followed
by
a
rabble
then
string
quartette
players
would
become
as
devious
and
in
their
ways
as
the
average
american
capitalist
is
and
when
by
a
process
of
setting
one
part
of
the
mob
against
the
rest
they
managed
to
get
a
chance
to
play
quartettes
in
temporary
peace
despite
the
general
mob
hatred
of
them
they
would
forget
the
lovely
music
of
haydn
and
mozart
altogether
and
devote
their
whole
time
to
a
playing
of
the
worst
musical
felonies
of
schönberg
ravel
and
strawinsky
ad
imaginem
dei
creavit
illum
life
of
the
old
anthropomorphic
notion
that
the
life
of
the
whole
universe
centers
in
the
life
of
man
that
human
existence
is
the
supreme
expression
of
the
cosmic
process
this
notion
seems
to
be
on
its
way
toward
the
sheol
of
exploded
delusions
the
fact
is
that
the
life
of
man
as
it
is
more
and
more
studied
in
the
light
of
general
biology
appears
to
be
more
and
more
empty
of
significance
once
apparently
the
chief
concern
and
masterpiece
of
the
gods
the
human
race
now
begins
to
bear
the
aspect
of
an
accidental
of
their
vast
inscrutable
and
probably
nonsensical
operations
a
blacksmith
making
a
produces
something
almost
as
brilliant
and
mysterious
the
shower
of
sparks
but
his
eye
and
thought
as
we
know
are
not
on
the
sparks
but
on
the
the
sparks
indeed
constitute
a
sort
of
disease
of
the
their
existence
depends
upon
a
wasting
of
its
tissue
in
the
same
way
perhaps
man
is
a
local
disease
of
the
cosmos
a
kind
of
pestiferous
eczema
or
urethritis
there
are
of
course
different
grades
of
eczema
and
so
are
there
different
grades
of
men
no
doubt
a
cosmos
afflicted
with
nothing
worse
than
an
infection
of
beethovens
would
not
think
it
worth
while
to
send
for
the
doctor
but
a
cosmos
infested
by
prohibitionists
socialists
scotsmen
and
stockbrokers
must
suffer
damnably
no
wonder
the
sun
is
so
hot
and
the
moon
is
so
diabetically
green
anthropomorphic
as
i
say
the
anthropomorphic
theory
of
the
world
is
made
absurd
by
modern
biology
but
that
is
not
saying
of
course
that
it
will
ever
be
abandoned
by
the
generality
of
men
to
the
contrary
they
will
cherish
it
in
proportion
as
it
becomes
more
and
more
dubious
indeed
it
is
cherished
as
it
was
never
cherished
in
the
ages
of
faith
when
the
doctrine
that
man
was
was
at
least
ameliorated
by
the
doctrine
that
woman
was
vile
what
else
is
behind
charity
philanthropy
pacifism
socialism
the
uplift
all
the
rest
of
the
current
sentimentalities
one
and
all
these
sentimentalities
are
based
upon
the
notion
that
man
is
a
glorious
and
ineffable
animal
and
that
his
continued
existence
in
the
world
ought
to
be
facilitated
and
insured
but
this
notion
is
obviously
full
of
fatuity
as
animals
go
even
in
so
limited
a
space
as
our
world
man
is
botched
and
ridiculous
few
other
brutes
are
so
stupid
or
so
cowardly
the
commonest
yellow
dog
has
far
sharper
senses
and
is
infinitely
more
courageous
not
to
say
more
honest
and
dependable
the
ants
and
the
bees
are
in
many
ways
far
more
intelligent
and
ingenious
they
manage
their
government
with
vastly
less
quarreling
wastefulness
and
imbecility
the
lion
is
more
beautiful
more
dignified
more
majestic
the
antelope
is
swifter
and
more
graceful
the
ordinary
is
cleaner
the
horse
foamed
by
labor
has
a
better
smell
the
gorilla
is
kinder
to
his
children
and
more
faithful
to
his
wife
the
ox
and
the
ass
are
more
industrious
and
serene
but
most
of
all
man
is
deficient
in
courage
perhaps
the
noblest
quality
of
them
all
he
is
not
only
mortally
afraid
of
all
other
animals
of
his
own
weight
or
half
his
weight
save
a
few
that
he
has
debased
by
artificial
inbreeding
he
is
even
mortally
afraid
of
his
own
kind
and
not
only
of
their
fists
and
hooves
but
even
of
their
sniggers
no
other
animal
is
so
defectively
adapted
to
its
environment
the
human
infant
as
it
comes
into
the
world
is
so
puny
that
if
it
were
neglected
for

infallibly
perish

congenital
infirmity

or

concealed

fish
without
fins
lacking
his
heavy
and
cumbersome
trappings
he
is
defenseless
even
against
flies
as
god
made
him
he
has
even
a
tail
to
switch
them
off
i
now
come
to
man
one
point
of
unquestionable
natural
superiority
he
has
a
soul
this
is
what
sets
him
off
from
all
other
animals
and
makes
him
in
a
way
their
master
the
exact
nature
of
that
soul
has
been
in
dispute
for
thousands
of
years
but
regarding
its
function
it
is
possible
to
speak
with
some
authority
that
function
is
to
bring
man
into
direct
contact
with
god
to
make
him
aware
of
god
above
all
to
make
him
resemble
god
well
consider
the
colossal
failure
of
the
device
if
we
assume
that
man
actually
does
resemble
god
then
we
are
forced
into
the
impossible
theory
that
god
is
a
coward
an
idiot
and
a
bounder
and
if
we
assume
that
man
after
all
these
years
does
resemble
god
then
it
appears
at
once
that
the
human
soul
is
as
inefficient
a
machine
as
the
human
liver
or
tonsil
and
that
man
would
probably
be
better
off
as
the
chimpanzee
undoubtedly
better
off
without
it
such
indeed
is
the
case
the
only
practical
effect
of
having
a
soul
is
that
it
fills
man
with
anthropomorphic
and
anthropocentric
vanities
in
brief
with
cocky
and
preposterous
superstitions
he
struts
and
plumes
himself
because
he
has
this
soul
and
overlooks
the
fact
that
it
does
work
thus
he
is
the
supreme
clown
of
creation
the
ad
of
animated
nature
he
is
like
a
cow
who
believed
that
she
could
jump
over
the
moon
and
ordered
her
whole
life
upon
that
theory
he
is
like
a
bullfrog
boasting
eternally
of
fighting
lions
of
flying
over
the
matterhorn
and
of
swimming
the
hellespont
and
yet
this
is
the
poor
brute
we
are
asked
to
venerate
as
a
gem
in
the
forehead
of
the
cosmos
this
is
the
worm
we
are
asked
to
defend
as
god
favorite
on
earth
with
all
its
millions
of
braver
nobler
decenter
quadrupeds
its
superb
lions
its
lithe
and
gallant
leopards
its
imperial
elephants
its
honest
dogs
its
courageous
rats
this
is
the
insect
we
are
besought
at
infinite
trouble
labor
and
expense
to
reproduce
on
man
capacity
for
abstract
thought
which
most
other
mammals
seem
to
lack
has
undoubtedly
given
him
his
present
mastery
of
the
land
surface
of
the
earth
a
mastery
disputed
only
by
several
hundred
species
of
microscopic
organisms
it
is
responsible
for
his
feeling
of
superiority
and
under
that
feeling
there
is
undoubtedly
a
certain
measure
of
reality
at
least
within
narrow
limits
but
what
is
too
often
overlooked
is
that
the
capacity
to
perform
an
act
is
by
no
means
synonymous
with
its
salubrious
exercise
the
simple
fact
is
that
most
of
man
thinking
is
stupid
pointless
and
injurious
to
him
of
all
animals
indeed
he
seems
the
least
capable
of
arriving
at
accurate
judgments
in
the
matters
that
most
desperately
affect
his
welfare
try
to
imagine
a
rat
in
the
realm
of
rat
ideas
arriving
at
a
notion
as
violently
in
contempt
of
plausibility
as
the
notion
say
of
swedenborgianism
or
that
of
homeopathy
or
that
of
infant
damnation
or
that
of
mental
telepathy
try
to
think
of
a
congregation
of
educated
rats
gravely
listening
to
such
disgusting
intellectual
rubbish
as
was
in
the
public
bulls
of
woodrow
wilson
man
natural
instinct
in
fact
is
never
toward
what
is
sound
and
true
it
is
toward
what
is
specious
and
false
let
any
great
nation
of
modern
times
be
confronted
by
two
conflicting
propositions
the
one
grounded
upon
the
utmost
probability
and
reasonableness
and
the
other
upon
the
most
glaring
error
and
it
will
almost
invariably
embrace
the
latter
it
is
so
in
politics
which
consists
wholly
of
a
succession
of
unintelligent
crazes
many
of
them
so
idiotic
that
they
exist
only
as
and
shibboleths
and
are
not
reducible
to
logical
statement
at
all
it
is
so
in
religion
which
like
poetry
is
simply
a
concerted
effort
to
deny
the
most
obvious
realities
it
is
so
in
nearly
every
field
of
thought
the
ideas
that
conquer
the
race
most
rapidly
and
arouse
the
wildest
enthusiasm
and
are
held
most
tenaciously
are
precisely
the
ideas
that
are
most
insane
this
has
been
true
since
the
first
advanced
gorilla
put
on
underwear
cultivated
a
frown
and
began
his
first
lecture
tour
in
the
first
chautauqua
and
it
will
be
so
until
the
high
gods
tired
of
the
farce
at
last
obliterate
the
race
with
one
great
final
blast
of
fire
mustard
gas
and
streptococci
no
doubt
the
imagination
of
man
is
to
blame
for
this
singular
weakness
that
imagination
i
daresay
is
what
gave
him
his
first
lift
above
his
fellow
primates
it
enabled
him
to
visualize
a
condition
of
existence
better
than
that
he
was
experiencing
and
bit
by
bit
he
was
able
to
give
the
picture
a
certain
crude
reality
even
he
keeps
on
going
ahead
in
the
same
manner
that
is
he
thinks
of
something
that
he
would
like
to
be
or
to
get
something
appreciably
better
than
what
he
is
or
has
and
then
by
the
laborious
costly
method
of
trial
and
error
he
gradually
moves
toward
it
in
the
process
he
is
often
severely
punished
for
his
discontent
with
god
ordinances
he
mashes
his
thumb
he
skins
his
shin
he
stumbles
and
falls
the
prize
he
reaches
out
for
blows
up
in
his
hands
but
bit
by
bit
he
moves
on
or
at
all
events
his
heirs
and
assigns
move
on
bit
by
bit
he
smooths
the
path
beneath
his
remaining
leg
and
achieves
pretty
toys
for
his
remaining
hand
to
play
with
and
accumulates
delights
for
his
remaining
ear
and
eye
alas
he
is
not
content
with
this
slow
and
sanguinary
progress
always
he
looks
further
and
further
ahead
always
he
imagines
things
just
over
the
this
body
of
imaginings
constitutes
his
stock
of
sweet
beliefs
his
corpus
of
high
faiths
and
confidences
in
brief
his
burden
of
errors
and
that
burden
of
errors
is
what
distinguishes
man
even
above
his
capacity
for
tears
his
talents
as
a
liar
his
excessive
hypocrisy
and
poltroonery
from
all
the
other
orders
of
mammalia
man
is
the
yokel
excellence
the
booby
unmatchable
the
king
dupe
of
the
cosmos
he
is
chronically
and
unescapably
deceived
not
only
by
the
other
animals
and
by
the
delusive
face
of
nature
herself
but
also
and
more
particularly
by
himself
by
his
incomparable
talent
for
searching
out
and
embracing
what
is
false
and
for
overlooking
and
denying
what
is
true
the
capacity
for
discerning
the
essential
truth
in
fact
is
as
rare
among
men
as
it
is
common
among
crows
bullfrogs
and
mackerel
the
man
who
shows
it
is
a
man
of
quite
extraordinary
quality
perhaps
even
a
man
downright
diseased
exhibit
a
new
truth
of
any
natural
plausibility
before
the
great
masses
of
men
and
not
one
in
ten
thousand
will
suspect
its
existence
and
not
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
will
embrace
it
without
a
ferocious
resistance
all
the
durable
truths
that
have
come
into
the
world
within
historic
times
have
been
opposed
as
bitterly
as
if
they
were
so
many
waves
of
smallpox
and
every
individual
who
has
welcomed
and
advocated
them
absolutely
without
exception
has
been
denounced
and
punished
as
an
enemy
of
the
race
perhaps
absolutely
without
exception
goes
too
far
i
substitute
with
five
or
six
exceptions
but
who
were
the
five
or
six
exceptions
i
leave
you
to
think
of
them
myself
i
ca
but
i
think
at
once
of
charles
darwin
and
his
associates
and
of
how
they
were
reviled
in
their
time
this
reviling
of
course
is
less
vociferous
than
it
used
to
be
chiefly
because
later
victims
are
in
the
arena
but
the
underlying
hostility
remains
within
the
past
two
years
the
principal
great
thinker
of
britain
george
bernard
shaw
has
denounced
the
hypothesis
of
natural
selection
to
great
applause
and
a
candidate
for
the
american
presidency
william
jennings
bryan
has
publicly
advocated
prohibiting
the
teaching
of
it
by
law
the
great
majority
of
christian
ecclesiastics
in
both
countries
and
with
them
the
great
majority
of
their
catachumens
are
still
committed
to
the
doctrine
that
darwin
was
a
scoundrel
and
herbert
spencer
another
and
huxley
a
third
and
that
nietzsche
is
to
the
three
of
them
what
beelzebub
himself
is
to
a
trio
of
bad
boys
this
is
the
reaction
of
the
main
body
of
respectable
folk
in
two
puissant
and
idealistic
christian
nations
to
the
men
who
will
live
in
history
as
the
intellectual
leaders
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
the
immemorial
attitude
of
men
in
the
mass
and
of
their
chosen
prophets
to
whatever
is
honest
and
important
and
most
probably
true
but
if
truth
thus
has
hard
sledding
error
is
given
a
loving
welcome
the
man
who
invents
a
new
imbecility
is
hailed
gladly
and
bidden
to
make
himself
at
home
he
is
to
the
great
masses
of
men
the
of
mankind
go
back
through
the
history
of
the
past
thousand
years
and
you
will
find
that
ninetenths
of
the
popular
idols
of
the
world
not
the
heroes
of
small
sects
but
the
heroes
of
mankind
in
the
mass
have
been
merchants
of
palpable
nonsense
it
has
been
so
in
politics
it
has
been
so
in
religion
and
it
has
been
so
in
every
other
department
of
human
thought
every
such
hawker
of
the
has
been
opposed
in
his
time
by
critics
who
denounced
and
refuted
him
his
contention
has
been
disposed
of
immediately
it
was
uttered
but
on
the
side
of
every
one
there
has
been
the
titanic
force
of
human
credulity
and
it
has
sufficed
in
every
case
to
destroy
his
foes
and
establish
his
immortality
and
his
of
all
the
unsound
ideas
thus
preached
by
great
heroes
and
accepted
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
their
eager
dupes
probably
the
most
patently
unsound
is
the
one
that
is
most
widely
held
to
wit
the
idea
that
man
has
an
immortal
soul
that
there
is
a
part
of
him
too
ethereal
and
too
exquisite
to
die
absolutely
the
only
evidence
supporting
this
astounding
notion
lies
in
the
hope
that
it
is
true
which
is
precisely
the
evidence
underlying
the
late
theory
that
the
great
war
would
put
an
end
to
war
and
bring
in
an
era
of
democracy
freedom
and
peace
but
even
archbishops
of
course
are
too
intelligent
to
be
satisfied
permanently
by
evidence
so
unescapably
dubious
in
consequence
there
have
been
efforts
in
all
ages
to
give
it
logical
and
evidential
support
well
all
i
ask
is
that
you
give
some
of
that
corroboration
your
careful
scrutiny
examine
for
example
the
proofs
amassed
by
five
typical
witnesses
in
five
widely
separated
ages
john
augustine
martin
luther
emanuel
swedenborg
and
sir
oliver
lodge
approach
these
proofs
prayerfully
and
study
them
well
weigh
them
in
the
light
of
the
probabilities
the
ordinary
intellectual
decencies
and
then
ask
yourself
if
you
could
imagine
a
accepting
them
gravely
to
sum
up
the
cosmos
is
a
gigantic
making
revolutions
a
minute
man
is
a
sick
fly
taking
a
dizzy
ride
on
it
religion
is
the
theory
that
the
wheel
was
designed
and
set
spinning
to
give
him

vi
men
i
open
the
memoirs
of
general
grant
volume
ii
at
the
place
where
he
is
describing
the
surrender
of
general
lee
and
find
the
following
i
was
without
a
sword
as
i
usually
was
when
on
horseback
on
sic
the
field
and
wore
a
soldier
blouse
for
a
coat
with
the
shoulder
straps
of
my
rank
to
indicate
to
the
army
who
i
was
anno
i
look
out
of
my
window
and
observe
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
passing
down
the
street
anno
like
general
grant
he
is
without
a
sword
like
general
grant
he
wears
a
sort
of
soldier
blouse
for
a
coat
like
general
grant
he
employs
shoulder
straps
to
indicate
to
the
army
who
he
is
but
there
is
something
more
on
the
left
breast
of
this
officer
apparently
a
major
there
blazes
so
brilliant
a
mass
of
color
that
as
the
sun
strikes
it
and
the
flash
bangs
my
eyes
i
wink
catch
my
breath
and
sneeze
there
are
two
long

starting
at
the

and
disappearing
into
the
shadows

indeed
how
he
would
shame
a

ticketwagon
if
he
wore
all
the
medals
and
badges
the
stars
and
crosses
the
pendants
and
lavallières
that
go
with
those
ribbons

at

simple
golden

on

the
kaiser
cannon
missed
him
just
what
all
these
ribbons
signify
i
am
sure
i
do
know
probably
they
belong
to
campaign
medals
and
tell
the
tale
of
butcheries
in
foreign
and
domestic
parts
mountains
of
dead
filipinos
mexicans
haitians
dominicans
west
virginia
miners
perhaps
even
prussians
but
in
addition
to
campaign
medals
and
the
distinguished
service
medal
there
are
now
certainly
enough
foreign
orders
in
the
united

to
give
a
distinct
brilliance
to
the

from

by
the
ragged
continentals
and
embodied
in
article
i
section
of
the

lasted
until
and
then
suddenly
blew
up
to
mention
it

a
sort
of
indecorum

no
doubt
will
be
a
species
of
treason
down
with
frederick
up
with
john
philip

imagine
what
general
pershing
would
look
like
at
a
state
banquet
of
his
favorite
american
order
the
benevolent
and
protective
one
of

in
all
the
byzantine
splendor
of
his
casket
of

the
lordly

disconcerting

on
the

that

for
one
with
a
fancy
for
gauds
of
that
sort
the
most
blinding
of
all
known
orders
is
the
medijie
of
turkey
which
not
only
entitles
the
holder
to
four
wives
but
also
absolutely
requires
him
to
wear
a
red
fez
and
a
frozen
star
covering
his
whole
façade
i
was
offered
this
order
by
turkish
spies
during
the
war
and
it
wabbled
me
a
good
deal
the
alexander
of
bulgaria

almost
as
seductive
the
badge
consists
of
an
pointed
white
cross
with
crossed
swords
between
the
arms
and
a
red
bulgarian
lion
over
the
swords
the
motto
is

then
there
are
the
prussian
orders
the
red

black
eagles
the
pour

the
prussian
crown
the
hohenzollern
and
the
rest
and
the
golden
fleece
of
austria
the
noblest
of
them
all
think
of
the
golden
fleece
on
a
man
born
in
linn
county
missouri
i
begin
to
doubt
that
the
general
would
have
got
it
even
supposing
him
to
have
taken
the
other
side
the
japs
i
note
gave
him
only
the
grand
cordon
of
the
paulownia
and
the
belgians
and
montenegrins
were
similarly
cautious
there
are
higher
classes
the
highest

the
paulownia
is
only
for
princes
which
is
to
say
only
for

are

grand

of

and
like
most
other
respectable

members

of

but
they
seem
to
have
been
forgotten
by
the
greeks
the
montenegrins
the
italians
and
the
belgians
the
and
extremely
anglomaniacal
sims
refused
the
distinguished

medal
of

is
careful
to
mention
in
who
who
in

that
his
grand
cross
of
michael
and
george
was
conferred
upon
him
not
by
some
servile
but
by

george
of

benson
omits
mention
of
his
majesty
as
do
pershing
and

it
would
be
hard
to
think
of
any
other
american
officer
real
or
bogus
who
would
refuse
the
or
failing
it
the
grand
decoration
of
chivalry
of
the
independent
order
of
odd
fellows
i
once
saw
the
latter
hung
with
ceremonies
of
the
utmost
magnificence
upon
a
tinner
who
had
served
the
fraternity
long
and
faithfully
as
he
marched
down
the
hall
toward
the
throne
of
the
supreme
exalted
pishposh
a
score
of
little
girls
the
issue
of
other
tinners
strewed
his
pathway
with
roses
and
around
the
stem
of
each
rose
was
a
piece
of
glittering
tinfoil
the
band
meanwhile
played
the
rosary
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
spectacle
as
fried
oysters
were
served
wien

wien
it
was
i
suspect
by
way
of
the
odd
fellows
and
other
such
gaudy
heirs
to
the
deutsche
ritter
and
rosicrucians
that
the
lust
to
gleam
and
jingle
got
into
the
arteries
of
the
american
people
for
years
the
austere
tradition
of
washington
day
served
to
keep
the
military
bosom
bare
of
spangles
but
all
the
while
a
weakness
for
them
was
growing
in
the
civil
population
rank
by
rank
they
became
knights
of
pythias
odd
fellows
red
men
nobles
of
the
mystic
shrine
knights
templar
patriarchs
militant
elks
moose
woodmen
of

foresters
ku
kluxers
and
in
every
new
order
there
were
degrees
and
for
every
degree
there
was
a
badge
and
for
every
badge
there
was
a
yard
of
ribbon
the
nobles
of
the
mystic
shrine
chiefly
paunchy
wholesalers
of
the

species
are
not
content
with

baldrics
stars

and

they
also
wear
red
fezes
the

run
to

the

like

the
patriotic

and
methodist
deacons
of
the
ku

carry

set
with

an
american
who
is
forced
by
his
profession
to
belong
to
many
such
orders
say
a
life
insurance
solicitor
a
bootlegger
or
a
dealer
in
oklahoma
oil
stock
accumulates
a
trunk
full
of
decorations
many
of
them
weighing
a
pound
there
is
an
undertaker
in
hagerstown
who
has
been
initiated
eighteen
times
when
he
robes
himself
to
plant
a
fellow
joiner
he
weighs
three
hundred
pounds
and
sparkles
and
flashes
like
the
mouth
of
hell
itself
he
is
entitled
to
bear
seven
swords
all
jeweled
and
to
hang
his
watch
chain
with
the
golden
busts
of
nine
wild
animals
all
with
precious
stones
for
eyes
put
beside
this
lowly
washer
of
the
dead
pershing
newly
polished
would
seem
almost
like
a
trappist
but
even
so
the
civil
arm
is
robbed
of
its
just
dues
in
the
department
of
gauds
and
radioactivity
no
doubt
by
the
direct
operation
of
military
vanity
and
jealousy
despite
a
million
proofs
and
perhaps
a
billion
eloquent
arguments
to
the
contrary
it
is
still
the
theory
at
the
official
ribbon
counter
that
the
only
man
who
serves
in
a
war
is
the
man
who
serves
in
uniform
this
is
soft
for
the
bevo
officer
who
at
least
has
his
service
stripes
and
the
spurs
that
gnawed
into
his
desk
but
it
is
hard
upon
his
brother
irving
the
man
who
worked
twenty
hours
a
day
for
fourteen
months
buying
canned
asparagus
and
raincoats
for
the
army
of
god
irving
not
only
labored
with
inconceivable
diligence
he
also
faced
hazards
of
no
mean
order
for
on
the
one
hand
was
his
natural
prejudice
in
favor
of
a
very
liberal
rewarding
of
commercial
enterprise
and
on
the
other
hand
were
his
patriotism
and
his
fear
of
atlanta
penitentiary
i
daresay
that
many
and
many
a
time
after
working
his
twenty
hours
he
found
it
difficult
to
sleep
the
remaining
four
hours
i
know
in
fact
survivors
of
that
obscure
service
who
are
far
worse
wrecks
than
pershing
is
their
reward
is
what
winks
sniffs
innuendos
if
they
would
indulge
themselves
in
the
now
almost
universal
american
yearning
to
go
adorned
they
must
join
the
knights
of
pythias
even
the
american
legion
fails
them
for
though
it
certainly
does
not
bar
it
insists
that
they
shall
have
done
their
in
uniform
what
i
propose
is
a
variety
of
the
distinguished
service
medal
for
civilians
perhaps
better
still
a
distinct
order
for
civilians
closed
to
the
military
and
with
badges
of
different
colors
and
areas
to
mark
off
varying
services
to
democracy
let
it
run
like
the
japanese
paulownia
from
high
to
low
the
lowest
class
for
the
patriot
who
sacrificed
only
time
money
and
a
few
nights
sleep
the
highest
for
the
great
martyr
who
hung
his
country
altar
with
his
dignity
his
decency
and
his
sacred
honor
for
irving
and
his
nervous
insomnia
a
simple
rosette
with
an
iron
badge
bearing
the
national
motto
safety
first
for
the
university
president
who
prohibited
the

for
this
giant

loyal
endeavor
let
no
per

american
speak
of
anything
less
than
the
grand
cross
of
the

with
a
gold
badge
in
polychrome
enamel

a

not
of

that
i
am
insensitive
to

of
the

of

but
in
such
matters
one
must
go
by
rarity
rather
than
by
intrinsic
value
if
the
grand
cordon
or
even
the
eagle
of
the
third
class
were
given
to
every
patriot
who
bored
a
hole
through
the

of
his
flat
to
get
evidence
against
his
neighbors
the
krausmeyers
and
to
every
one
who
visited

nightly
denounced
the

in
searing
terms
and
demanded
assent
from
emil

of

when

was
open
in

then
there
would

no

left
for

on

as
on
the
military
side
the
great
rewards
of
war
go
not
to
mere
dogged
industry
and
fidelity
but
to
originality
to
the
unprecedented
the
arresting
the
bizarre
the
new
york
liar
who
invented
the
story
about
the
german
plant
for
converting
the
corpses
of
the
slain
into
soap
did
more
for
democracy
and
the
wilsonian
idealism
and
hence
deserves
a
more
brilliant
recognition
than
a
thousand
uninspired
hawkers
of
atrocity
stories
supplied
by
viscount
bryce
and
his
associates
for
that
great
servant
of
righteousness
the
grand
cordon
with
two
silver
badges
and
the
chair
of
history
at
columbia
would
be
scarcely
enough
for
the
ordinary
hawkers
any
precious
metal
would
be
too
much
whether
or
not
the

decorated
its
chocolate
pedlars

i
do
not
know
since
the
chief
lamassary
in
my
town
of
baltimore
became
the
scene
of
a
scandal
i
have
ceased
to
frequent
evangelical
society
if
not
then
there
should
be
some
governmental
recognition
of
those
highly
characteristic
heroes
of
the
war
for
democracy
the
veterans
of
the
line
true
enough
dislike
them
excessively
and
have
a
habit
of
denouncing
them
obscenely
when
the
flows
they
charged
too
much
for
cigarettes
they
tried
to
discourage
the
amiability
of
the
ladies
of
france
they
had
a
habit
of
being
absent
when
the
shells
burst
in
air
well
some
say
this
and
some
say
that
a
few
at
least
of
the
pale
and
oleaginous
brethren
must
have
gone
into
the
master
work
because
they
thirsted
to
save
souls
and
not
simply
because
they
desired
to
escape
the
trenches
and
a
few
i
am
told
were
anything
but
unpleasantly
righteous
as
a
round
of
wassermanns
would
show
if
as
may
be
plausibly
argued
these
soldiers
of
the
double
cross
deserve
to
live
at

they
surely
deserve
to
be

says
otto

in

growth

of

a

acquirement

the

whole

of

authors
is
needed

bring
about

it

be
called
when

an
inch
or
so
lower
down
the
page
he
points
out
that
what
he
says
of
prose
is
by
no
means
true
of
verse
that
poetry
of
very
respectable
quality
is
often
written
by
peoples
and
individuals
whose
prose
is
quite
as
crude
and
graceless
as
that
say
of
the
hon
warren
gamaliel
harding
that
even
the
of
time
a
race
as
barbarous
as
the
modern
or
mississippians
were
yet
capable
on
occasion
of
writing
dithyrambs
of
an
indubitable
sweet
gaudiness
the
point
needs
no
laboring
a
glance
at
the
history
of
any
literature
will
prove
its
soundness
moreover
it
is
supported
by
what
we
see
around
us
every
day
that
is
if
we
look
in
literary
directions
some
of
the
best
verse
in
the
modern
movement
at
home
and
abroad
has
been
written
by
intellectual
adolescents
who
could
no
more
write
a
paragraph
in
prose
then
they
could
leap

matterhorn

all
sorts
of
hollow

male
and
female
of
the
best
poetry
of
the
world
has
been
written
by
poets
less
than
thirty
years
old
a
great
deal
more
than
half
of
it
has
been
written
by
poets
under
one
always
associates
poetry
with
youth
for
it
deals
chiefly
with
the
ideas
that
are
peculiar
to
youth
and
its
terminology
is
quite
as
youthful
as
its
content
when
one
hears
of
a
poet
past
he
seems
somehow
unnatural
and
even
a
trifle
obscene
it
is
as
if
one
encountered
a
graying
man
who
still
played
the
chopin
waltzes
and
believed
in
elective
affinities
but
prose
obviously
is
a
sterner
and
more
elderly
matter
all
the
great
masters
of
prose
and
especially
of
english
prose
for
its
very
resilience
and
brilliance
make
it
extraordinarily
hard
to
write
have
had
to
labor
for
years
before
attaining
to
their
mastery
of
it
the
early
prose
of
abraham
lincoln
was
remarkable
only
for
its
badness
it
was
rhetorical
and
bombastic
and
full
of
supernumerary
words
in
brief
it
was
a
kind
of
poetry
it
took
years
and
years
of
hard
striving
for
abe
to
develop
the
simple
and
exquisite
prose
of
his
last
so
with
thomas
henry
huxley
perhaps
the
greatest
virtuoso
of
plain
english
who
has
ever
lived
his
first
writings
were
competent
but
undistinguished
he
was
almost
a
grandfather
before
he
perfected
his
superb
style
and
so
with
anatole
france
and
addison
and
macaulay
and
george
moore
and
james
branch
cabell
and
and
lord
dunsany
and
nietzsche
and
to
go
back
to
antiquity
marcus
tullius
cicero
i
have
been
told
that
the
average
age
of
the
men
who
made
the
authorized
version
of
the
bible
was
beyond
sixty
years
had
they
been
under
thirty
they
would
have
made
it
lyrical
as
it
was
they
made
it
colossal
the
reason
for
all
this
is
not
far
to
seek
prose
however
powerful
its
appeal
to
the
emotions
is
always
based
primarily
upon
logic
and
is
thus
scientific
poetry
whatever
its
intellectual
content
is
always
based
upon
mere
sensation
and
emotion
and
is
thus
loose
and
disorderly
a
man
must
have
acquired
discipline
over
his
feelings
before
he
can
write
sound
prose
he
must
have
learned
how
to
subordinate
his
transient
ideas
to
more
general
and
permanent
ideas
above
all
he
must
have
acquired
a
good
head
for
words
which
is
to
say
a
capacity
for
resisting
their
mere
lascivious
lure
but
to
write
acceptable
poetry
or
even
good
poetry
he
needs
none
of
these
things
if
his
hand
runs
away
with
his
head
it
is
actually
a
merit
if
he
writes
what
every
one
knows
to
be
untrue
in
terms
that
no
sane
adult
would
ever
venture
to
use
in
real
life
it
is
proof
of
his
divine
afflation
if
he
slops
over
and
heaves
around
in
a
manner
never
hitherto
observed
on
land
or
sea
the
fact
proves
his
originality
the
forms
of
verse
and
the
rules
of
rhyme
and
rhythm
do
not
offer
him
difficulties
they
offer
him
refuges
their
purpose
is
not
to
keep
him
in
order
but
simply
to
give
him
countenance
by
providing
him
with
a
formal
orderliness
when
he
is
most
out
of
order
using
them
is
like
swimming
with
bladders
the
first
literary
composition
of
a
child
is
always
some
sort
of
jingle
it
starts
out
with
an
inane
idea
half
an
idea
sticking
to
prose
it
could
go
no
further
but
to
its
primary
imbecility
it
now
adds
a
meaningless
phrase
which
while
logically
unrelated
provides
an
agreeable
concord
in
mere
sound
and
the
result
is
the
primordial
tadpole
of
a
sonnet
all
the
sonnets
of
the
world
save
a
few
of
miraculous
and
perhaps
accidental
quality
partake
of
this
fundamental
nonsensicality
in
all
of
them
there
are
ideas
that
would
sound
idiotic
in
prose
and
phrases
that
would
sound
clumsy
and
uncouth
in
prose
but
the
rhyme
scheme
conceals
this
nonsensicality
as
a
substitute
for
the
missing
logical
plausibility
it
provides
a
sensuous
harmony
reading
the
thing
one
gets
a
vague
effect
of
agreeable
sound
and
so
the
logical
feebleness
is
overlooked
it
is
in
a
sense
like
observing
a
pretty
girl
competently
dressed
and
made
up
across
the
footlights
but
translating
the
poem
into
prose
is
like
meeting
and
marrying
her
ii
much
of
the
current
discussion
of
poetry
and
what
save
prohibition
is
more
discussed
in
america
is
corrupted
by
a
fundamental
error
that
error
consists
in
regarding
the
thing
itself
as
a
simple
entity
to
be
described
conveniently
in
a
picturesque
phrase
poetry
says
one
critic
is
the
statement
of
overwhelming
emotional
values
poetry
says
another
is
an
attempt
to
purge
language
of
everything
except
its
music
and
its
pictures
poetry
says
a
third
is
the
entering
of
delicately
imaginative
plateaus
poetry
says
a
fourth
is
truth
carried
alive
into
the
heart
by
a
passion
poetry
says
a
fifth
is
compacted
of
what
seems
not
of
what
is
poetry
says
a
sixth
is
the
expression
of
thought
in
musical
language
poetry
says
a
seventh
is
the
language
of
a
state
of
crisis
and
so
on
and
so
on
est
poetica
they
all
answer
and
yet
they
all
fail
to
answer
poetry
in
fact
is
two
quite
distinct
things
it
may
be
either
or
both
one
is
a
series
of
words
that
are
intrinsically
musical
in
and
rhythm
as
the
single
word
is
musical
the
other
is
a
series
of
ideas
false
in
themselves
that
offer
a
means
of
emotional
and
imaginative
escape
from
the
harsh
realities
of
everyday
in
brief
i
succumb
like
all
the
rest
to
poetry
is
a
comforting
piece
of
fiction
set
to
more
or
less
lascivious
music
a
slap
on
the
back
in
waltz
time
a
grand
release
of
longings
and
repressions
to
the
tune
of
flutes
harps
sackbuts
psalteries
and
the
usual
strings
as
i
say
poetry
may
be
either
the
one
thing
or
the
other
caressing
music
or
caressing
assurance
it
need
not
necessarily
be
both
consider
a
familiar
example
from
othello
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall
ever
medicine
thee
to
that
sweet
sleep
which
thou
yesterday
here
the
sense
at
best
is
surely
very
vague
probably
not
one
auditor
in
a
hundred
hearing
an
actor
recite
those
glorious
lines
attaches
any
intelligible
meaning
to
the
archaic
word
the
cornerstone
of
the
whole
sentence
nevertheless
the
effect
is
stupendous
the
passage
assaults
and
benumbs
the
faculties
like
schubert
ständchen
or
the
slow
movement
of
schumann
rhenish
symphony
hearing
it
is
a
sensuous
debauch
the
man
anæsthetic
to
it
could
stand
unmoved
before
rheims
cathedral
or
the
hofbräuhaus
at
munich
one
easily
recalls
many
other
such
bursts
of
pure
music
almost
meaningless
but
infinitely
delightful
in
poe
in
swinburne
in
marlowe
even
in
joaquin
miller
of
the
charm
of
reading
chaucer
setting
aside
the
rabelaisian
comedy
comes
out
of
the
mere
burble
of
the
words
the
meaning
to
a
modern
is
often
extremely
obscure
and
sometimes
downright
undecipherable
the
whole
fame
of
poe
as
a
poet
is
based
upon
five
short
poems
of
them
three
are
almost
pure
music
their
intellectual
content
is
of
the
vaguest
no
one
would
venture
to
reduce
them
to
plain
english
even
poe
himself
always
thought
of
them
not
as
statements
of
poetic
ideas
but
as
simple
utterances
of
poetic
musical
sounds
it
was
sidney
lanier
himself
a
competent
poet
who
first
showed
the
dependence
of
poetry
upon
music
he
had
little
to
say
unfortunately
about
the
of
words
what
concerned
him
almost
exclusively
was
rhythm
in
the
science
of
english
verse
he
showed
that
the
charm
of
this
rhythm
could
be
explained
in
the
technical
terms
of
music
that
all
the
old
gabble
about
dactyls
and
spondees
was
no
more
than
a
dog
latin
invented
by
men
who
were
fundamentally
ignorant
of
the
thing
they
discussed
lanier
book
was
the
first
intelligent
work
ever
published
upon
the
nature
and
structure
of
the
sensuous
content
of
english
poetry
he
struck
out
into
such
new
and
far
paths
that
the
professors
of
prosody
still
lag
behind
him
after
forty
years
quite
unable
to
understand
a
poet
who
was
also
a
shrewd
critic
and
a
musician
but
if
so
deeply
concerned
with
rhythm
he
marred
his
treatise
by
forgetting
he
marred
it
still
more
by
forgetting
content
poetry
that
is
all
music
is
obviously
relatively
rare
for
only
a
poet
who
is
also
a
natural
musician
can
write
it
and
natural
musicians
are
much
rarer
in
the
world
than
poets
ordinary
poetry
average
poetry
thus
depends
in
part
upon
its
ideational
material
and
perhaps
even
chiefly
it
is
the
expressed
in
a
poem
and
not
the
mellifluousness
of
the
words
used
to
express
it
that
arrests
and
enchants
the
average
connoisseur
often
indeed
he
disdains
this
mellifluousness
and
argues
that
the
idea
ought
to
be
set
forth
without
the
customary
pretty
jingling
or
at
most
with
only
the
scant
jingling
that
lies
in
rhythm
in
brief
he
wants
his
ideas
in
the
altogether
and
so
advocates
it
was
another
american
this
time
prescott
of
cornell
university
who
first
gave
scientific
attention
to
the
intellectual
content
of
poetry
his
book
is
called
poetry
and
dreams
its
virtue
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
rejects
all
the
customary
mystical
and
romantic
definitions
of
poetry
and
seeks
to
account
for
the
thing
in
straightforward
psychological
terms
poetry
says
prescott
is
simply
the
verbal
materialization
of
a
the
statement
of
a
freudian
wish
an
attempt
to
satisfy
a
subconscious
longing
by
saying
that
it
is
satisfied
in
brief
poetry
represents
imagination
bold
effort
to
escape
from
the
cold
and
clammy
facts
that
hedge
us
in
to
soothe
the
wrinkled
and
fevered
brow
with
beautiful
balderdash
on
the
precise
nature
of
this
beautiful
balderdash
you
can
get
all
in
the
information
you
need
by
opening
at
random
the
nearest
book
of
verse
the
ideas
you
will
find
in
it
may
be
divided
into
two
main
divisions
the
first
consists
of
denials
of
objective
facts
the
second
of
denials
of
subjective
facts
specimen
of
the
first
sort
god
in
his
heaven
all
well
with
the
world
specimen
of
the
second
i
am
the
master
of
my
fate
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
it
is
my
contention
that
all
poetry
forgetting
for
the
moment
its
possible
merit
as
mere
sound
may
be
resolved
into
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
these
frightful
imbecilities
that
its
essential
character
lies
in
its
bold
flouting
of
what
every
reflective
adult
knows
to
be
the
truth
the
poet
imagining
him
to
be
sincere
is
simply
one
who
disposes
of
all
the
horrors
of
life
on
this
earth
and
of
all
the
difficulties
presented
by
his
own
inner
weaknesses
no
less
by
the
childish
device
of
denying
them
is
it
a
fact
that
love
is
an
emotion
that
is
almost
as
perishable
as
eggs
that
it
is
biologically
impossible
for
a
given
male
to
yearn
for
a
given
female
more
than
a
few
brief
years
then
the
poet
disposes
of
it
by
assuring
his
girl
that
he
will
nevertheless
love
her
forever
more
by
pledging
his
word
of
honor
that
he
believes
that
will
love
forever
is
it
equally
notorious
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
justice
in
the
world
that
the
good
are
tortured
insanely
and
the
evil
go
free
and
prosper
then
the
poet
composes
a
piece
crediting
god
with
a
mysterious
and
unintelligible
theory
of
jurisprudence
whereby
the
torture
of
the
good
is
a
sort
of
favor
conferred
upon
them
for
their
goodness
is
it
of
almost
equally
widespread
report
that
no
healthy
man
likes
to
contemplate
his
own
inevitable
death
that
even
in
time
of
war
with
a
vast
pumping
up
of
emotion
to
conceal
the
fact
every
soldier
hopes
and
believes
that
he
personally
will
escape
then
the
poet
first
carefully
introducing
himself
into
a
achieves
strophes
declaring
that
he
is
free
from
all
such
weakness
that
he
will
deliberately
seek
a
rendezvous
with
death
and
laugh
when
the
bullet
finds
him
the
precise
nature
of
the
imbecility
thus
solemnly
set
forth
depends
very
largely
of
course
upon
the
private
prejudices
and
yearnings
of
the
poet
and
the
reception
that
is
given
it
depends
by
the
same
token
upon
the
private
prejudices
and
yearnings
of
the
reader
that
is
why
it
is
often
so
difficult
to
get
any
agreement
upon
the
merits
of
a
definite
poem
to
get
any
agreement
upon
its
capacity
to
soothe
there
is
the
man
who
craves
only
the
animal
delights
of
a
sort
of
paradise
to
him
the
frost
is
on
the
pumpkin
is
a
noble
poem
there
is
the
man
who
yearns
to
get
out
of
the
visible
universe
altogether
and
tread
the
fields
of
asphodel
for
him
there
is
delight
only
in
the
mystical
stuff
of
crashaw
thompson
yeats
and
company
there
is
the
man
who
revolts
against
the
sordid
christian
notion
of
immortality
an
eternity
to
be
spent
flapping
wings
with
pious
and
oleaginous
anglican
bishops
he
finds
escape
in
the
gorgeous
blasphemies
of
swinburne
there
is
to
make
an
end
of
examples
the
man
who
with
an
inferiority
complex
eating
out
his
heart
is
moved
by
a
great
desire
to
stalk
the
world
in
heroic
guise
he
may
go
to
the
sonorous
swanking
of
kipling
or
he
may
go
to
something
more
subtle
to
some
poem
in
which
the
boasting
is
more
artfully
concealed
say
christina
rosetti
when
i
am
dead
many
men
many
complexes
many
secret
yearnings
they
collect
of
course
in
groups
if
the
group
happens
to
be
large
enough
the
poet
it
is
devoted
to
becomes
famous
kipling
great
fame
is
thus
easily
explained
he
appeals
to
the
commonest
of
all
types
of
men
next
to
the
sentimental
type
which
is
to
say
he
appeals
to
the
bully
and
braggart
type
the
type
the
patriot
type
less
harshly
described
to
the
boy
type
all
of
us
have
been
kiplingomaniacs
at
some
time
or
other
i
was
myself
a
very
ardent
one
at
and
wrote
many
grandiloquent
sets
of
verse
in
the
manner
of
tommy
atkins
and
but
if
the
gifts
of
observation
and
reflection
have
been
given
to
us
we
get
over
it
there
comes
a
time
when
we
no
longer
yearn
to
be
heroes
but
seek
only
peace
maybe
even
hope
for
quick
extinction
then
we
turn
to
swinburne
and
the
garden
of
proserpine
more
false
assurances
more
mellifluous
another
tinkling
but
how
sweet
on
blue
days
iii
one
of
the
things
to
remember
here
too
often
it
is
forgotten
and
prescott
deserves
favorable
mention
for
stressing
it
is
that
a
man
conscious
desires
are
not
always
identical
with
his
subconscious
longings
in
fact
the
two
are
often
directly
antithetical
no
doubt
the
real
man
lies
in
the
depths
of
the
subconscious
like
a
carp
lurking
in
mud
his
conscious
personality
is
largely
a
product
of
his
environment
the
reaction
of
his
subconscious
to
the
prevailing
notions
of
what
is
meet
and
seemly
here
of
course
i
wander
into
platitude
for
the
news
that
all
men
are
frauds
was
already
stale
in
the
days
of
hammurabi
the
ingenious
freud
simply
translated
the
fact
into
pathological
terms
added
a
scene
and
so
laid
the
foundations
for
his
psychoanalysis
incidentally
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
freud
made
a
curious
mistake
when
he
brought
sex
into
the
foreground
of
his
new
magic
he
was
of
course
quite
right
when
he
set
up
the
doctrine
that
in
civilized
societies
sex
impulses
were
more
apt
to
be
suppressed
than
any
other
natural
impulses
and
that
the
subconscious
thus
tended
to
be
crowded
with
their
ghosts
but
in
considering
sex
impulses
he
forgot
sex
imaginings
digging
out
by
painful
in
a
darkened
room
some
startling
tale
of
carnality
in
his
patient
past
he
committed
the
incredible
folly
of
assuming
it
to
be
literally
true
more
often
than
not
i
believe
it
was
a
mere
piece
of
boasting
a
materialization
of
desire
in
brief
a
poem
it
is
astonishing
that
this
possibility
never
occurred
to
the
venerable
professor
it
is
more
astonishing
that
it
has
never
occurred
to
any
of
his
disciples
he
should
have
psychoanalyzed
a
few
poets
instead
of
wasting
all
his
time
upon
psychopathic
women
with
sclerotic
husbands
he
would
have
dredged
amazing
things
out
of
their
subconsciouses
heroic
as
well
as
amorous
imagine
the
billions
of
boers
germans
irishmen
and
hindus
that
kipling
would
have
confessed
to
killing
but
here
i
get
into
morbid
anatomy
and
had
better
haul
up
what
i
started
out
to
say
was
that
a
man
preferences
in
poetry
constitute
an
excellent
means
of
estimating
his
inner
cravings
and
credulities
the
music
disarms
his
critical
sense
and
he
confesses
to
cherishing
ideas
that
he
would
repudiate
with
indignation
if
they
were
put
into
plain
words
i
say
he
cherishes
those
ideas
maybe
he
simply
tolerates
them
unwillingly
maybe
they
are
no
more
than
inescapable
heritages
from
his
barbarous
ancestors
like
his
vermiform
appendix
think
of
the
poems
you
like
and
you
will
come
upon
many
such
intellectual
fossils
ideas
that
you
by
no
means
subscribe
to
openly
but
that
nevertheless
give
you
a
strange
joy
i
put
myself
on
the
block
as
exhibit
a
there
is
my
delight
in
lizette
woodworth
reese
sonnet
tears
nothing
could
do
more
violence
to
my
conscious
beliefs
put
into
prose
the
doctrine
in
the
poem
would
exasperate
and
even
enrage
me
there
is
no
man
in
christendom
who
is
less
a
christian
than
i
am
but
here
the
dead
hand
grabs
me
by
the
ear
my
ancestors
were
converted
to
christianity
in
the
year
and
remained
of
that
faith
until
near
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
observe
now
the
load
i
carry
more
than
two
hundred
years
of
christianity
and
perhaps
a
thousand
years
maybe
even
two
or
three
thousand
years
of
worship
of
heathen
gods
before
that
at
least
twelve
hundred
years
of
uninterrupted
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
it
any
wonder
that
betrayed
by
the
incomparable
music
of
miss
reese
monosyllables
my
conscious
faith
is
lulled
to
sleep
thus
giving
my
subconscious
a
chance
to
wallow
in
its
immemorial
superstition
even
so
my
vulnerability
to
such
superstitions
is
very
low
and
it
tends
to
grow
less
as
i
increase
in
years
and
sorrows
as
i
have
said
i
once
throbbed
to
the
of
kipling
later
on
i
was
responsive
to
the
mellow
romanticism
of
tennyson
now
it
takes
one
of
the
genuinely
fundamental
delusions
of
the
human
race
to
move
me
but
progress
is
not
continuous
it
has
interludes
there
are
days
when
every
one
of
us
experiences
a
sort
of
ontogenetic
and
returns
to
an
earlier
stage
of
development
it
is
on
such
days
that
grown
men
break
down
and
cry
like
children
it
is
then
that
they
play
games
or
cheer
the
flag
or
fall
in
love
and
it
is
then
that
they
are
in
the
mood
for
poetry
and
get
comfort
out
of
its
asseverations
of
the
obviously
not
true
a
truly
civilized
man
when
he
is
wholly
himself
derives
no
pleasure
from
hearing
a
poet
state
as
browning
stated
that
this
world
is
perfect
such
tosh
not
only
does
not
please
him
it
definitely
offends
him
as
he
is
offended
by
an
idiotic
article
in
a
newspaper
it
roils
him
to
encounter
so
much
stupidity
in
christendom
but
he
may
like
it
when
he
is
drunk
or
suffering
from
some
low
toxemia
or
staggering
beneath
some
great
disaster
then
as
i
say
the
ontogenetic
process
reverses
itself
and
he
slides
back
into
infancy
then
he
goes
to
poets
just
as
he
goes
to
women
glad
books
and
dogmatic
theology
the
very
highest
orders
of
men
perhaps
never
suffer
from
such
malaises
of
the
spirit
or
if
they
suffer
from
them
never
succumb
to
them
these
are
men
who
are
so
thoroughly
civilized
that
even
the
most
severe
attack
upon
the
emotions
is
not
sufficient
to
dethrone
their
reason
charles
darwin
was
such
a
man
there
was
never
a
moment
in
his
life
when
he
sought
religious
consolation
and
there
was
never
a
moment
when
he
turned
to
poetry
in
fact
he
regarded
all
poetry
as
silly
other
men
more
sensitive
to
the
possible
music
in
it
regard
it
with
less
positive
aversion
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
truly
man
who
got
any
permanent
satisfaction
out
of
its
content
the
browning
societies
of
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
i
choose
the
browning
societies
because
browning
poetry
was
often
more
or
less
logical
in
content
and
thus
above
the
ordinary
intellectually
were
not
composed
of
such
men
as
huxley
spencer
lecky
buckle
and
travelyn
but
of
moony
old
maids
candidates
for
theosophy
literary
vicars
collectors
of
rogers
groups
and
other
such
philistines
the
chief
propagandist
for
browning
in
the
united
states
was
not
henry
adams
or
william
summer
or
daniel
gilman
but
an
obscure
professor
of
english
who
was
also
an
ardent
and
what
is
thus
true
ontogenetically
is
also
true
phylogenetically
that
is
to
say
poetry
is
chiefly
produced
and
esteemed
by
peoples
that
have
not
yet
come
to
maturity
the
romans
had
a
dozen
poets
of
the
first
talent
before
they
had
a
single
prose
writer
of
any
skill
whatsoever
so
did
the
english
so
did
the
germans
in
our
own
day
we
see
the
negroes
of
the
south
producing
religious
and
secular
verse
of
such
quality
that
it
is
taken
over
by
the
whites
and
yet
the
number
of
negroes
who
show
a
decent
prose
style
is
still
very
small
and
there
is
no
sign
of
it
increasing
similarly
the
white
authors
of
america
during
the
past
ten
or
fifteen
years
have
produced
a
great
mass
of
very
creditable
poetry
and
yet
the
quality
of
our
prose
remains
very
low
and
the
americans
with
prose
styles
of
any
distinction
could
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
two
hands
iv
so
far
i
have
spoken
chiefly
of
the
content
of
poetry
in
its
character
as
a
sort
of
music
it
is
plainly
a
good
deal
more
respectable
and
makes
an
appeal
to
a
far
higher
variety
of
reader
or
at
all
events
to
a
reader
in
a
state
of
greater
mental
clarity
a
capacity
for
music
by
which
i
mean
melody
harmony
and
comes
late
in
the
history
of
every
race
the
savage
can
apprehend
rhythm
but
he
is
quite
incapable
of
carrying
a
tune
in
any
intelligible
scale
the
negro
roustabouts
of
our
own
south
who
are
commonly
regarded
as
very
musical
are
actually
only
rhythmical
they
never
invent
melodies
but
only
rhythms
and
the
whites
to
whom
their
barbarous
chiefly
appeal
are
in
their
own
stage
of
culture
when
one
observes
a
room
full
of
men
and
women
swaying
and
wriggling
to
the
tune
of
some
villainous
mazurka
from
the
mississippi
levees
one
may
assume
very
soundly
that
they
are
all
the
sort
of
folk
who
play
golf
and
bridge
and
prefer
the
sheik
to
heart
of
darkness
and
believe
in
the
league
of
nations
a
great
deal
of
superficial
culture
is
compatible
with
that
pathetic
barbarism
and
even
a
high
degree
of
æsthetic
sophistication
in
other
directions
the
greeks
who
built
the
parthenon
knew
no
more
about
music
than
a
hog
knows
of
predestination
they
were
almost
as
ignorant
in
that
department
as
the
modern
iowans
or
new
yorkers
it
was
not
indeed
until
the
renaissance
that
music
as
we
know
it
appeared
in
the
world
and
it
was
not
until
less
than
two
centuries
ago
that
it
reached
a
high
development
in
shakespeare
day
music
was
just
getting
upon
its
legs
in
england
in
goethe
day
it
was
just
coming
to
full
flower
in
germany
in
france
and
america
it
is
still
in
the
savage
state
it
is
thus
the
youngest
of
the
arts
and
the
most
difficult
and
hence
the
noblest
any
sane
young
man
of
can
write
an
acceptable
sonnet
or
design
a
habitable
house
or
draw
a
horse
that
will
not
be
mistaken
for
an
automobile
but
before
he
may
write
even
a
bad
string
quartet
he
must
go
through
a
long
and
arduous
training
just
as
he
must
strive
for
years
before
he
may
write
prose
that
is
instantly
recognizable
as
prose
and
not
as
a
string
of
mere
words
the
virtue
of
such
great
poets
as
shakespeare
does
not
lie
in
the
content
of
their
poetry
but
in
its
music
the
content
of
the
shakespearean
plays
in
fact
is
often
puerile
and
sometimes
quite
incomprehensible
no
scornful
essays
by
george
bernard
shaw
and
frank
harris
were
needed
to
demonstrate
the
fact
it
lies
plainly
in
the
text
one
snickers
sourly
over
the
spectacle
of
generations
of
pedants
debating
the
question
of
hamlet
mental
processes
the
simple
fact
is
that
shakespeare
gave
him
no
more
mental
processes
than
a
fifth
avenue
rector
has
but
merely
employed
him
as
a
convenient
spout
for
some
of
the
finest
music
ever
got
into
words
assume
that
he
has
all
the
hellish
sagacity
of
a
nietzsche
and
that
music
remains
unchanged
assume
that
he
is
as
idiotic
as
a
grand
worthy
flubdub
of
the
freemasons
and
it
still
remains
unchanged
as
it
is
intoned
on
the
stage
by
actors
the
poetry
of
shakespeare
commonly
loses
content
altogether
one
can
not
make
out
what
the
is
saying
one
can
only
observe
that
it
is
beautiful
there
are
whole
speeches
in
the
shakespearean
plays
whose
meaning
is
unknown
ever
to
scholars
and
yet
they
remain
favorites
and
well
deserve
to
who
knows
again
what
the
sonnets
are
about
is
the
bard
talking
about
the
wife
at
oxford
or
about
a
love
affair
of
a
pathological
character
some
say
one
thing
and
some
say
the
other
but
all
who
have
ears
must
agree
that
the
sonnets
are
extremely
beautiful
stuff
that
the
english
language
reaches
in
them
the
topmost
heights
of
conceivable
beauty
shakespeare
thus
ought
to
be
ranked
among
the
musicians
along
with
beethoven
as
a
philosopher
he
was
a
but
so
was
old
ludwig
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
done
with
prose
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
about
it
one
day
i
believe
that
he
would
have
written
prose
as
good
as
dryden
and
the
next
day
i
begin
to
fear
that
he
would
have
produced
something
as
bad
as
swinburne
he
had
the
ear
but
he
lacked
the
logical
sense
poetry
has
done
enough
when
it
charms
but
prose
must
also
convince
i
do
not
forget
of
course
that
there
is
a
borderland
in
which
it
is
hard
to
say
of
this
or
that
composition
whether
it
is
prose
or
poetry
lincoln
gettysburg
speech
is
commonly
reckoned
as
prose
and
yet
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
quite
as
much
poetry
as
the
queen
mab
speech
or
marlowe
mighty
elegy
on
helen
of
troy
more
it
is
so
read
and
admired
by
the
great
masses
of
the
american
people
it
is
an
almost
perfect
specimen
of
a
comforting
but
unsound
asseveration
put
into
rippling
and
hypnotizing
words
done
into
plain
english
the
statements
of
fact
in
it
would
make
even
a
writer
of
school
laugh
so
with
parts
of
the
declaration
of
independence
no
one
believes
seriously
that
they
are
true
but
nearly
everyone
agrees
that
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
they
true
and
meanwhile
eighteenth
century
rhetoric
by
johnson
out
of
john
lyly
euphues
completes
the
enchantment
in
the
main
the
test
is
to
be
found
in
the
audience
rather
than
in
the
poet
if
it
is
naturally
intelligent
and
in
a
sober
and
critical
mood
demanding
sense
and
proofs
then
nearly
all
poetry
becomes
prose
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
congenitally
maudlin
or
has
a
few
drinks
aboard
or
is
in
love
or
is
otherwise
in
a
soft
and
believing
mood
then
even
the
worst
of
prose
if
it
has
a
touch
of
soothing
in
it
becomes
moving
poetry
for
example
the
diplomatic
and
political
of
the
late
wilson
a
man
constitutionally
unable
to
reason
clearly
or
honestly
but
nevertheless
one
full
of
the
burbling
that
caresses
the
ears
of
simple
men
most
of
his
speeches
during
the
days
of
his
divine
appointment
translated
into
intelligible
english
would
have
sounded
as
idiotic
as
a
prose
version
of
the
blessed
damozel
read
by
his
opponents
they
sounded
so
without
the
translation
but
at
the
extremes
of
course
there
are
indubitable
poetry
and
incurable
prose
and
the
difference
is
not
hard
to
distinguish
prose
is
simply
a
form
of
writing
in
which
the
author
intends
that
his
statements
shall
be
accepted
as
conceivably
true
even
when
they
are
about
imaginary
persons
and
events
its
appeal
is
to
the
fully
conscious
and
alertly
reasoning
man
poetry
is
a
form
of
writing
in
which
the
author
attempts
to
disarm
reason
and
evoke
emotion
partly
by
presenting
images
that
awaken
a
powerful
response
in
the
subconscious
and
partly
by
the
mere
sough
and
blubber
of
words
poetry
is
not
distinguished
from
prose
as
lowes
says
in
his
convention
and
revolt
in
poetry
by
an
exclusive
phraseology
but
by
a
peculiar
attitude
of
mind
an
attitude
of
of
of
saying
what
is
true
it
is
essentially
an
effort
to
elude
the
bitter
facts
of
life
whereas
prose
is
essentially
a
means
of
unearthing
and
exhibiting
them
the
gap
is
bridged
by
sentimental
prose
which
is
half
prose
and
half
poetry
lincoln
gettysburg
speech
the
average
sermon
the
prose
of
an
erotic
novelette
immediately
the
thing
acquires
a
literal
meaning
it
ceases
to
be
poetry
immediately
it
becomes
capable
of
convincing
an
adult
and
perfectly
sober
man
during
the
hours
between
breakfast
and
luncheon
it
is
indisputably
prose
this
quality
of
untruthfulness
pervades
all
poetry
good
and
bad
you
will
find
it
in
the
very
best
poetry
that
the
world
has
so
far
produced
to
wit
in
the
sonorous
poems
of
the
jewish
scriptures
the
ancient
jews
were
stupendous
poets
moreover
they
were
shrewd
psychologists
and
so
knew
the
capacity
of
poetry
given
the
believing
mind
to
convince
and
enchant
in
other
words
its
capacity
to
drug
the
auditor
in
such
a
manner
that
he
accepts
it
literally
as
he
might
accept
the
baldest
prose
this
danger
in
poetry
given
auditors
impressionable
enough
is
too
little
estimated
and
understood
it
is
largely
responsible
for
the
persistence
of
sentimentality
in
a
world
apparently
designed
for
the
one
purpose
of
manufacturing
cynics
it
is
probably
chiefly
responsible
for
the
survival
of
christianity
despite
the
hard
competition
that
it
has
met
with
from
other
religions
the
theology
of
christianity
its
prose
is
certainly
no
more
convincing
than
that
of
half
a
dozen
other
religions
that
might
be
named
it
is
in
fact
a
great
deal
less
convincing
than
the
theology
of
say
buddhism
but
the
poetry
of
christianity
is
infinitely
more
lush
and
beautiful
than
that
of
any
other
religion
ever
heard
of
there
is
more
lovely
poetry
in
one
of
the
psalms
than
in
all
of
the
scriptures
of
the
world
taken
together
more
this
poetry
is
in
both
testaments
the
new
as
well
as
the
old
who
could
imagine
a
more
charming
poem
than
that
of
the
child
in
the
manger
it
has
enchanted
the
world
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
it
is
simple
exquisite
and
overwhelming
its
power
to
arouse
emotion
is
so
great
that
even
in
our
age
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
fully
a
half
of
the
kindliness
romanticism
and
humane
sentimentality
that
survive
in
christendom
it
is
worth
a
million
syllogisms
once
after
plowing
through
sixty
or
seventy
volumes
of
bad
verse
i
described
myself
as
a
the
epithet
was
and
is
absurd
the
truth
is
that
i
enjoy
poetry
as
much
as
the
next
man
when
the
mood
is
on
me
but
what
mood
the
mood
in
a
few
words
of
intellectual
and
spiritual
fatigue
the
mood
of
revolt
against
the
insoluble
riddle
of
existence
the
mood
of
disgust
and
despair
poetry
then
is
a
capital
medicine
first
its
sweet
music
lulls
and
then
its
artful
presentation
of
the
beautifully
improbable
soothes
and
gives
surcease
it
is
an
escape
from
life
like
religion
like
enthusiasm
like
glimpsing
a
pretty
girl
and
to
the
mere
sensuous
joy
in
it
to
the
mere
low
delight
in
getting
away
from
the
world
for
a
bit
there
is
added
if
the
poetry
be
good
something
vastly
better
something
reaching
out
into
the
realm
of
the
intelligent
to
wit
appreciation
of
good
workmanship
a
sound
sonnet
is
almost
as
pleasing
an
object
as
a
fugue
a
pretty
lyric
deftly
done
has
all
the
technical
charm
of
a
fine
carving
i
think
it
is
craftsmanship
that
i
admire
most
in
the
world
brahms
enchants
me
because
he
knew
his
trade
perfectly
i
like
richard
strauss
because
he
is
full
of
technical
ingenuities
because
he
is
a
well
who
ever
heard
of
a
finer
craftsman
than
william
shakespeare
his
music
was
magnificent
he
played
superbly
upon
all
the
common
emotions
and
he
did
it
magnificently
he
did
it
with
an
air
no
i
am
no
but
even
shakespeare
i
most
enjoy
not
on
brisk
mornings
when
i
feel
fit
for
any
deviltry
but
on
dreary
evenings
when
my
old
wounds
are
troubling
me
and
some
fickle
one
has
just
sent
back
the
autographed
set
of
my
first
editions
and
bills
are
piled
up
on
my
desk
and
i
am
too
sad
to
work
then
i
mix
a
stiff
dram
and
read
poetry
viii
five

at
random
the
backwardness
of
the
art
of
biography
in
these
states
is
made
shiningly
visible
by
the
fact
that
we
have
yet
to
see
a
life
of
either
lincoln
or
whitman
of
lincolniana
of
course
there
is
no
end
nor
is
there
any
end
to
the
hospitality
of
those
who
collect
it
some
time
ago
a
publisher
told
me
that
there
are
four
kinds
of
books
that
never
under
any
circumstances
lose
money
in
the
united

first
detective
stories
secondly

forcibly
debauched

other
such
claptrap
and
fourthly
books
on
lincoln
but
despite
all
the
vast
mass
of
lincolniana
and
the
constant
discussion
of
old
abe
in
other
ways
even
so
elemental
a
problem
as
that
of
his
religious
faith
surely
an
important
matter
in
any
competent
biography
is
yet
but
half
solved
here
for
example
is
the
rev
william
barton
grappling
with
it
for
more
than
four
hundred
large
pages
in
the
soul
of
abraham
lincoln
it
is
a
lengthy
inquiry
the
rev
pastor
in
truth
shows
a
good
deal
of
the
habitual
garrulity
of
his
order
but
it
is
never
tedious
on
the
contrary
it
is
curious
and
amusing
and
i
have
read
it
with
steady
interest
including
even
the
appendices
unluckily
the
author
like
his
predecessors
fails
to
finish
the
business
before
him
was
lincoln
a
christian
did
he
believe
in
the
divinity
of
christ
i
am
left
in
doubt
he
was
very
polite
about
it
and
very
cautious
as
befitted
a
politician
in
need
of
christian
votes
but
how
much
genuine
conviction
was
in
that
politeness
and
if
his
occasional
references
to
christ
were
thus
open
to
question
what
of
his
rather
vague
avowals
of
belief
in
a
personal
god
and
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
herndon
and
some
of
his
other
close
friends
always
maintained
that
he
was
an
atheist
but
barton
argues
that
this
atheism
was
simply
disbelief
in
the
idiotic
methodist
and
baptist
dogmas
of
his
time
that
nine
christian
churches
out
of
ten
if
he
were
alive
would
admit
him
to
their
high
privileges
and
prerogatives
without
anything
worse
than
a
few
warning
coughs
as
for
me
i
still
wonder
the
growth
of
the
lincoln
legend
is
truly
amazing
he
becomes
the
american
solar
myth
the
chief
butt
of
american
credulity
and
sentimentality
washington
of
late
years
has
been
perceptibly
humanized
every
schoolboy
now
knows
that
he
used
to
swear
a
good
deal
and
was
a
sharp
trader
and
had
a
quick
eye
for
a
pretty
ankle
but
meanwhile
the
varnishers
and
veneerers
have
been
busily
converting
abe
into
a
plaster
saint
thus
making
him
fit
for
adoration
in
the
chautauquas
and
c
all
the
popular
pictures
of
him
show
him
in
his
robes
of
state
and
wearing
an
expression
fit
for
a
man
about
to
be
hanged
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
not
a
single
portrait
of
him
showing
him
smiling
and
yet
he
must
have
cackled
a
good
deal
first
and
last
who
ever
heard
of
a
storyteller
who
did
worse
there
is
an
obvious
effort
to
pump
all
his
human
weaknesses
out
of
him
and
so
leave
him
a
mere
moral
apparition
a
sort
of
amalgam
of
john
wesley
and
the
holy
ghost
what
could
be
more
absurd
lincoln
in
point
of
fact
was
a
practical
politician
of
long
experience
and
high
talents
and
by
no
means
cursed
with
inconvenient
ideals
on
the
contrary
his
career
in
the
illinois
legislature
was
that
of
a
good
organization
man
and
he
was
more
than
once
denounced
by
reformers
even
his
handling
of
the
slavery
question
was
that
of
a
politician
not
that
of
a
fanatic
nothing
alarmed
him
more
than
the
suspicion
that
he
was
an
abolitionist
barton
tells
of
an
occasion
when
he
actually
fled
town
to
avoid
meeting
the
issue
squarely
a
genuine
abolitionist
would
have
published
the
emancipation
proclamation
the
day
after
the
first
battle
of
bull
run
but
lincoln
waited
until
the
time
was
more
favorable
until
lee
had
been
hurled
out
of
pennsylvania
and
more
important
still
until
the
political
currents
were
safely
running
his
way
always
he
was
a
wary
fellow
both
in
his
dealings
with
measures
and
in
his
dealings
with
men
he
knew
how
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
nevertheless
it
was
his
eloquence
that
probably
brought
him
to
his
great
estate
like
william
jennings
bryan
he
was
a
dark
horse
made
suddenly
formidable
by
fortunate
rhetoric
the
douglas
debate
launched
him
and
the
cooper
union
speech
got
him
the
presidency
this
talent
for
emotional
utterance
this
gift
for
making
phrases
that
enchanted
the
plain
people
was
an
accomplishment
of
late
growth
his
early
speeches
were
mere
empty
fireworks
the
childish
rhodomontades
of
the
era
but
in
middle
life
he
purged
his
style
of
ornament
and
it
became
almost
baldly
simple
and
it
is
for
that
simplicity
that
he
is
remembered
the
gettysburg
speech
is
at
once
the
shortest
and
the
most
famous
oration
in
american
history
put
beside
it
all
the
whoopings
of
the
websters
sumners
and
everetts
seem
gaudy
and
silly
it
is
eloquence
brought
to
a
pellucid
and
almost
perfection
the
highest
emotion
reduced
to
one
graceful
and
irresistible
gesture
nothing
else
precisely
like
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
whole
range
of
oratory
lincoln
himself
never
even
remotely
approached
it
it
is
genuinely
stupendous
but
let
us
not
forget
that
it
is
oratory
not
logic
beauty
not
sense
think
of
the
argument
in
it
put
it
into
the
cold
words
of
everyday
the
doctrine
is
simply
this
that
the
union
soldiers
who
died
at
gettysburg
sacrificed
their
lives
to
the
cause
of
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
should
not
perish
from
the
earth
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
untrue
the
union
soldiers
in
that
battle
actually
fought
against
it
was
the
confederates
who
fought
for
the
right
of
their
people
to
govern
themselves
what
was
the
practical
effect
of
the
battle
of
gettysburg
what
else
than
the
destruction
of
the
old
sovereignty
of
the
states
of
the
people
of
the
states
the
confederates
went
into
battle
an
absolutely
free
people
they
came
out
with
their
freedom
subject
to
the
supervision
and
vote
of
the
rest
of
the
country
and
for
nearly
twenty
years
that
vote
was
so
effective
that
they
enjoyed
scarcely
any
freedom
at
all
am
i
the
first
american
to
note
the
fundamental
nonsensicality
of
the
gettysburg
address
if
so
i
plead
my
æsthetic
joy
in
it
in
amelioration
of
the
sacrilege
elmer
nothing
new
is
to
be
found
in
the
latest
volume
of
paul
elmer
shelburne
essays
the
learned
author
undismayed
by
the
winds
of
anarchic
doctrine
that
blow
down
his
princeton
stovepipe
continues
to
hold
fast
to
the
notions
of
his
earliest
devotion
he
is
still
the
gallant
champion
sent
against
the
romantic
movement
by
the
forces
of
discipline
and
decorum
he
is
still
the
eloquent
fugleman
of
the
puritan
ethic
and
æsthetic
in
so
massive
a
certainty
so
resolute
an
immovability
there
is
something
almost
magnificent
these
are
somewhat
sad
days
for
the
exponents
of
that
ancient
correctness
the
goths
and
the
huns
are
at
the
gate
and
as
they
batter
wildly
they
throw
dead
cats
perfumed
lingerie
tracts
against
predestination
and
the
bound
files
of
the
the
and
the
over
the
fence
but
the
din
does
not
flabbergast
more
high
above
the
battlements
there
is
a
tower
of
ivory
within
and
solid
without
and
in
its
austere
upper
chamber
he
sits
undaunted
solemnly
composing
an
elegy
upon
jonathan
edwards
the
greatest
theologian
and
philosopher
yet
produced
in
this
country
magnificent
indeed
and
somehow
charming
on
days
when
i
have
no
nobler
business
i
sometimes
join
the
barbarians
and
help
them
to
launch
their
abominable
bombs
against
the
embattled
it
is
in
the
main
fighting
that
is
too
easy
too
to
be
amusing
think
of
the
decayed
professors
assembled
by
franklin
for
the
review
who
could
get
any
genuine
thrill
out
of
dropping
they
come
out
on
crutches
and
are
as
much
afraid
of
what
is
behind
them
as
they
are
of
what
is
in
front
of
them
facing
all
the
horrible
artillery
of
nineveh
and
tyre
they
arm
themselves
with
nothing
worse
than
the
pedagogical
birch
the
janissaries
of
adolph
ochs
the
supreme
archon
are
even
easier
one
has
but
to
blow
a
and
down
they
go
even
stuart
sherman
is
no
antagonist
to
delight
a
heretic
sherman
is
at
least
honestly
american
of
course
but
the
trouble
with
him
is
that
he
is
american
the
iowa
hayseed
remains
in
his
hair
he
ca
get
rid
of
the
smell
of
the
chautauqua
one
inevitably
sees
in
him
a
sort
of
ad
of
his
fundamental
theory
to
wit
the
theory
that
the
test
of
an
artist
is
whether
he
hated
the
kaiser
in
and
plays
his
honorable
part
in
christian
endeavor
and
prefers
to
scharlachberger
and
has
taken
to
heart
the
great
lessons
of
sex
hygiene
sherman
is
game
but
he
does
offer
sport
in
the
grand
manner
moreover
he
has
been
showing
sad
signs
of
late
of
a
despairing
heart
he
tries
to
be
ingratiating
and
begins
to
hug
in
the
clinches
the
really
tempting
quarry
is
more
to
rout
him
out
of
his
armored
tower
to
get
him
out
upon
the
glacis
for
a
duel
before
both
armies
to
bring
him
finally
to
the
wager
of
battle
this
would
be
an
enterprise
to
bemuse
the
most
audacious
and
give
pause
to
the
most
talented
more
has
a
solid
stock
of
learning
in
his
lockers
he
is
armed
and
outfitted
as
none
of
the
pollyannas
who
trail
after
him
is
armed
and
outfitted
he
is
perhaps
the
nearest
approach
to
a
genuine
scholar
that
we
have
in
america
god
save
us
all
but
there
is
simply
no
truculence
in
him
no
flair
for
debate
no
lust
to
do
execution
upon
his
foes
his
method
is
wholly
year
after
year
he
simply
iterates
and
reiterates
his
misty
protests
seldom
changing
so
much
as
a
word
between
his
first
volume
and
his
last
there
is
not
the
difference
between
gog
and
magog
steadily
ploddingly
vaguely
he
continues
to
preach
the
gloomy
gospel
of
tightness
and
restraint
he
was
against
the
electric
thrill
of
freer
feeling
when
he
began
and
he
will
be
against
it
on
that
last
gray
day
i
hope
it
long
my
own
hanging
when
the
ultimate
embalmer
sneaks
upon
him
with
velvet
tread
and
they
haul
down
the
flag
to
at
princeton
and
the
readers
of
the
new
york
note
that
an
obscure
somebody
named
paul
more
is
dead
a
vast
and
hefty
tome
celebrates
this
dead
poet
solemnly
issued
by
his
mourning
friends
in
louisville
the
editor
is
otto
rothert
who
confesses
that
he
knew
cawein
but
a
year
or
two
and
never
read
his
poetry
until
after
his
death
the
contributors
include
such
local
as
reuben
post
halleck
leigh
gordon
giltner
anna
blanche
mcgill
and
elvira
miller
slaughter
most
of
the
ladies
gush
over
the
departed
in
the
manner
of
teachers
paying
tribute
to
plato
montaigne
or
dante
alighieri
his
young
son
seventeen
years
old
contributes
by
far
the
most
vivid
and
intelligent
account
of
him
it
is
indeed
very
well
written
as
in
a
different
way
is
the
contribution
of
charles
hamilton
musgrove
an
old
newspaper
friend
the
ladies
as
i
hint
simply
swoon
and
grow
lyrical
but
it
is
a
fascinating
volume
all
the
same
and
well
worth
the
room
it
takes
on
the
shelf
rothert
starts
off
with
what
he
calls
a
picturography
of
cawein
the
poet
father
and
mother
in
the
raiment
of
the
of
his
mother
uncle
the
house
which
now
stands
on
the
site
of
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
the
rock
spring
from
which
he
used
to
drink
as
a
boy
a
group
showing
him
with
his
three
brothers
another
showing
him
with
one
brother
and
their
cousin
fred
cawein
himself
with
sideboards
the
houses
he
lived
in
the
place
where
he
worked
the
walks
he
liked
around
louisville
his
wife
and
baby
the
hideous
bust
of
him
in
the
louisville
public
library
the
church
from
which
he
was
buried
his
modest
grave
in
cave
hill
cemetery
in
brief
all
the
photographs
that
collect
about
a
man
as
he
staggers
through
life
and
entertain
his
ribald
grandchildren
after
he
is
gone
then
comes
a
treatise
on
the
ancestry
and
youth
of
the
poet
then
a
collection
of
newspaper
clippings
about
him
then
a
gruesomely
particular
account
of
his
death
then
a
fragment
of
autobiography
then
a
selection
from
his
singularly
dull
letters
then
some
prose
pieces
from
his
pen
then
the
aforesaid
tributes
of
his
neighbors
and
finally
a
bibliography
of
his
works
and
an
index
to
them
as
i
say
a
volume
of
fearful
bulk
and
beam
but
nevertheless
full
of
curious
and
interesting
things
cawein
of
course
was
not
a
poet
of
the
first
rank
nor
is
it
certain
that
he
has
any
secure
place
in
the
second
rank
but
in
the
midst
of
a
great
deal
of
obvious
and
feeble
stuff
he
undoubtedly
wrote
some
nature
lyrics
of
excellent
quality
the
woods
and
the
fields
were
his
delight
he
loved
to
roam
through
them
observing
the
flowers
the
birds
the
tall
trees
the
shining
sky
overhead
the
green
of
spring
the
reds
and
browns
of
autumn
the
still
whites
of
winter
there
were
times
when
he
got
his
ecstasy
into
words
when
he
wrote
poems
that
were
sound
and
beautiful
these
poems
will
not
be
forgotten
there
will
be
no
history
of
american
literature
written
for
a
hundred
years
that
does
not
mention
madison
cawein
but
what
will
the
literary
historians
make
of
the
man
himself
how
will
they
explain
his
possession
however
fitfully
of
the
divine
gift
his
genuine
kinship
with
wordsworth
and
shelly
certainly
no
more
unlikely
candidate
for
the
bays
ever
shinned
up
parnassus
his
father
was
a
quack
doctor
his
mother
was
a
professional
spiritualist
he
himself
for
years
and
years
made
a
living
as
cashier
in
a
could
anything
be
more
grotesque
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
more
improbable
setting
for
a
poet
yet
the
facts
are
the
facts
and
rothert
makes
no
attempt
whatever
to
conceal
them
add
a
final
touch
of
the
bizarre
cawein
fell
over
one
morning
while
shaving
in
his
bathroom
and
cracked
his
head
on
the
bathtub
and
after
his
death
there
was
a
row
over
his
life
insurance
rothert
presents
all
of
the
documents
the
autopsy
is
described
the
death
certificate
is
quoted
a
strange
strange
tale
indeed
though
so
far
as
i
know
this
harris
is
a
perfectly
reputable
man
fearing
god
and
obeying
the
laws
it
is
not
to
be
gainsaid
that
a
certain
flavor
of
the
sinister
hangs
about
his
aspect
the
first
time
i
ever
enjoyed
the
honor
of
witnessing
him
there
bobbed
up
in
my
mind
instantly
put
away
as
unworthy
and
unseemly
a
memory
of
the
handsome
dogs
who
used
to
chain
shrieking
virgins
to
railway
tracks
in
the
innocent
dramas
of
my
youth
the
while
a
couple
of
stage
hands
imitated
the
rumble
of
the
empire
state
express
in
the
wings
there
was
the
same
elegance
of
the
same
black
mustachios
the
same
erect
figure
and
lordly
air
the
same
agate
glitter
in
the
eyes
the
same
aloof
and
superior
smile
a
sightly
fellow
by
all
the
gods
and
one
who
obviously
knew
how
to
sneer
that
afternoon
in
fact
we
had
a
sneering
match
and
before
it
was
over
most
of
the
great
names
in
the
letters
and
politics
of
the
time
had
been
reduced
to
faint
hisses
and
well
a
sneerer
has
his
good
days
and
his
bad
days
there
are
times
when
his
gift
gives
him
such
comfort
that
it
can
be
matched
only
by
god
grace
and
there
are
times
when
it
launches
upon
him
such
showers
of
darts
that
he
is
bound
to
feel
a
few
stings
harris
got
the
darts
first
for
the
year
that
he
came
back
to
his
native
land
after
a
generation
of
exile
was
the
year
in
which
anglomania
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
national
religion
and
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
english
among
whom
he
had
lived
since
the
early
was
chiefly
of
a
very
waspish
and
disconcerting
character
worse
he
not
only
said
it
twirling
his
mustache
defiantly
he
also
wrote
it
down
and
published
it
in
a
book
this
book
was
full
of
shocks
for
the
rapt
worshippers
of
the
motherland
and
particularly
for
the
literary
who
followed
the
pious
leadership
of
woodrow
and
ochs
putnam
and
roosevelt
wister
and
cyrus
curtis
young
reid
and
jay
so
they
called
a
special
meeting
of
the
american
academy
of
arts
and
letters
sang
god
save
the
king
kissed
the
union
jack
and
put
harris
into
coventry
and
there
he
remained
for
five
or
six
long
years
the
literary
reviews
never
mentioned
him
his
books
were
expunged
from
the
minutes
when
he
was
heard
of
at
all
it
was
only
in
whispers
and
the
general
burden
of
those
whispers
was
that
he
was
in
the
pay
of
the
kaiser
and
plotting
to
garrot
the
rev
william
manning
so
down
to
then
the
english
with
characteristic
lack
of
delicacy
played
a
ghastly
trick
upon
all
those
dutiful
and
colonists
that
is
to
say
they
suddenly
forgave
harris
his
criminal
refusal
to
take
their
war
buncombe
seriously
exhumed
him
from
his
long
solitude
among
the
and
began
praising
him
in
rich
hearty
terms
as
a
literary
gentleman
of
the
first
water
and
even
as
the
chief
adornment
of
american
letters
the
english
notices
of
his
contemporary
portraits
second
series
were
really
quite
amazing
the
london
gave
him
two
solid
columns
and
where
the
led
all
the
other
great
organs
of
english
literary
opinion
followed
the
book
itself
was
described
as
something
extraordinary
a
piece
of
criticism
full
of
shrewdness
and
originality
and
the
author
was
treated
with
the
utmost
politeness
one
imagines
the
painful
sensation
in
the
new
york
office
the
dismayed
groups
around
campus
pumps
the
special
meetings
of
the
princeton
and
urbana
american
legions
the
secret
conference
between
the
national
institute
of
arts
and
letters
and
the
ku
klux
klan
but
though
there
was
tall
talk
by
hot
heads
nothing
could
be
done
say
wo
and
the
dutiful
turns
to
the
right
say
gee
and
he
turns
to
the
left
it
is
too
much
of
course
to
ask
him
to
cheer
as
well
as
turn
but
he
nevertheless
turns
since
i
have
heard
no
more
whispers
against
harris
from
professors
and
vigilantes
but
on
two
or
three
occasions
the
subject
coming
up
i
have
heard
him
sneer
his
master
sneer
and
each
time
my
blood
has
run
cold
well
what
is
in
him
my
belief
frequently
expressed
is
that
there
is
a
great
deal
his
oscar
wilde
is
by
long
odds
the
best
literary
biography
ever
written
by
an
american
an
astonishingly
frank
searching
and
vivid
reconstruction
of
character
a
piece
of
criticism
that
makes
all
ordinary
criticism
seem
professorial
and
lifeless
the
comstocks
i
need
not
say
tried
to
suppress
it
a
brilliant
light
is
thrown
upon
harris
by
the
fact
that
they
failed
ignominiously
all
the
odds
were
in
favor
of
the
comstocks
they
had
patriotism
on
their
side
and
the
help
of
all
the
swine
who
flourished
in
those
days
nevertheless
harris
gave
them
a
severe
beating
and
scared
them
half
to
death
in
brief
a
man
of
the
most
extreme
bellicosity
enterprise
and
courage
a
fellow
whose
ideas
are
expressed
absolutely
regardless
of
tender
feelings
whether
genuine
or
bogus
in
the
man
shakespeare
and
the
women
of
shakespeare
he
tackled
the
whole
body
of
academic
english
critics
and
routed
them
the
two
books
marred
perhaps
by
a
too
bombastic
spirit
yet
contain
some
of
the
soundest
shrewdest
and
most
convincing
criticism
of
shakespeare
that
has
ever
been
written
all
the
old
is
thrown
overboard
there
is
an
entirely
new
examination
of
the
materials
and
to
the
business
is
brought
a
knowledge
of
the
plays
so
ready
and
so
vast
that
that
of
even
the
most
learned
don
begins
to
seem
a
mere
smattering
the
same
great
grasp
of
facts
and
evidences
is
visible
in
the
sketches
which
make
up
the
three
volumes
of
contemporary
portraits
what
one
always
gets
out
of
them
is
a
feeling
that
the
man
knows
the
men
he
is
writing
about
that
he
not
only
knows
what
he
sets
down
but
a
great
deal
more
there
is
here
nothing
of
the
cold
correctness
of
the
usual
literary
estimate
warts
are
not
forgotten
whether
of
the
nose
or
of
the
immortal
soul
the
subject
beginning
as
a
political
shibboleth
or
a
row
of
books
gradually
takes
on
all
the
colors
of
life
and
then
begins
to
move
naturally
and
freely
i
know
of
no
more
brilliant
evocations
of
personality
in
any
literature
and
most
of
them
are
personalities
of
sharp
flavor
for
harris
in
his
day
seems
to
have
known
almost
everybody
worth
knowing
and
whoever
he
knew
went
into
his
laboratory
for
vivisection
the
man
is
thus
a
first
rate
critic
of
his
time
and
what
he
has
written
about
his
contemporaries
is
certain
to
condition
the
view
of
them
held
in
the
future
what
gives
him
his
value
in
this
difficult
field
is
first
of
all
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
his
cynical
detachment
his
capacity
for
viewing
men
and
ideas
objectively
in
his
life
of
course
there
have
been
friendships
and
some
of
them
have
been
strong
and
but
when
he
writes
it
is
with
a
sort
of
surgical
remoteness
as
if
the
business
in
hand
were
vastly
more
important
than
the
man
he
was
lately
protesting
violently
that
he
was
and
is
quite
devoid
of
malice
granted
but
so
is
a
surgeon
to
write
of
george
moore
as
he
has
written
may
be
writing
devoid
of
malice
but
nevertheless
the
effect
is
precisely
that
which
would
follow
if
some
malicious
enemy
were
to
drag
poor
george
out
of
his
celibate
couch
in
the
dead
of
night
and
chase
him
naked
down
shaftsbury
avenue
the
thing
is
appallingly
revelatory
and
i
believe
that
it
is
true
the
moore
that
he
depicts
may
not
be
absolutely
the
real
moore
but
he
is
unquestionably
far
nearer
to
the
real
moore
than
the
moore
of
the
moore
books
the
method
of
course
has
its
defects
harris
is
far
more
interested
fundamentally
in
men
than
in
their
ideas
the
catholic
sweep
of
his
contemporary
portraits
proves
it
in
consequence
his
judgments
of
books
are
often
colored
by
his
opinions
of
their
authors
he
dislikes
mark
twain
as
his
own
antithesis
a
trimmer
and
poltroon
a
connecticut
yankee
is
drivel
which
leads
us
as
euclid
hath
it
to
absurdity
he
once
had
a
row
with
dreiser
the
titan
is
nonsense
which
is
itself
nonsense
but
i
know
of
no
critic
who
is
wholly
free
from
that
quite
human
weakness
in
the
academic
bunkophagi
it
is
everything
they
are
willing
to
swallow
anything
so
long
as
the
author
is
sound
upon
the
league
of
nations
it
seems
to
me
that
such
aberrations
are
rarer
in
harris
than
in
most
he
may
have
violent
prejudices
but
it
is
seldom
that
they
play
upon
a
man
who
is
honest
i
judge
from
his
frequent
discussions
of
himself
he
is
happily
free
from
the
vanity
of
modesty
that
the
pets
of
his
secret
heart
are
his
ventures
into
fiction
and
especially
the
bomb
and
montes
the
matador
the
latter
has
been
greatly
praised
by
arnold
bennett
who
has
also
praised
leonard
merrick
i
have
read
it
four
or
five
times
and
always
with
enjoyment
it
is
a
powerful
and
adept
tale
well
constructed
and
beautifully
written
it
recalls
some
of
the
best
of
the
shorter
stories
of
thomas
hardy
alongside
it
one
might
range
half
a
dozen
other
harris
stories
all
of
them
carefully
put
together
every
one
the
work
of
a
very
skillful
journeyman
but
despite
harris
the
authentic
harris
is
not
the
he
has
talents
of
course
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
put
montes
the
matador
beside
heart
of
darkness
in
love
in
youth
he
descends
to
unmistakable
fluff
and
feebleness
the
real
harris
is
the
author
of
the
wilde
volumes
of
the
two
books
about
shakespeare
of
the
three
volumes
of
contemporary
portraits
here
there
is
stuff
that
lifts
itself
clearly
and
brilliantly
above
the
general
criticism
that
has
a
terrific
vividness
and
plausibility
and
all
the
gusto
that
the
professors
can
never
pump
up
harris
makes
his
opinions
not
only
interesting
but
important
what
he
has
to
say
always
seems
novel
ingenious
and
true
here
is
the
chief
of
an
american
who
when
all
values
are
reckoned
up
will
be
found
to
have
been
a
sound
artist
and
an
extremely
intelligent
courageous
and
original
man
and
infinitely
the
superior
of
the
poor
dolts
who
once
tried
so
childishly
to
dispose
of
him
if
the
test
of
the
personal
culture
of
a
man
be
the
degree
of
his
freedom
from
the
banal
ideas
and
childish
emotions
which
move
the
great
masses
of
men
then
havelock
ellis
is
undoubtedly
the
most
civilized
englishman
of
his
generation
he
is
a
man
of
the
soundest
and
widest
learning
but
it
is
not
his
positive
learning
that
gives
him
distinction
it
is
his
profound
and
implacable
skepticism
his
penetrating
eye
for
the
transient
the
disingenuous
and
the
shoddy
so
unconditioned
a
skepticism
it
must
be
plain
is
not
an
english
habit
the
average
englishman
of
science
though
he
may
challenge
the
continentals
within
his
speciality
is
only
too
apt
to
sink
to
the
level
of
a
politician
a
green
grocer
or
a
suburban
clergyman
outside
it
the
examples
of
wallace
crookes
and
lodge
are
anything
but
isolated
scratch
an
english
naturalist
and
you
are
likely
to
discover
a
spiritualist
take
an
english
metaphysician
to
where
the
band
is
playing
and
if
he
begins
to
snuffle
patriotically
you
need
not
be
surprised
the
late
war
uncovered
this
weakness
in
a
wholesale
manner
the
english
as
a
class
not
only
stood
by
their
country
they
also
stood
by
the
hon
david
lloyd
george
the
mail
and
the
mob
in
trafalgar
square
unluckily
the
asinine
manifestations
ensuing
for
instance
the
proofs
of
the
eminent
oxford
philologist
that
the
germans
had
never
contributed
anything
to
philology
are
not
to
be
described
with
good
grace
by
an
american
for
they
were
far
surpassed
on
this
side
of
the
water
england
at
least
had
ellis
with
bertrand
russell
wilfrid
scawen
blunt
and
a
few
others
in
the
background
we
had
on
that
plane
no
one
ellis
it
seems
to
me
stood
above
all
the
rest
and
precisely
because
his
dissent
from
the
prevailing
imbecilities
was
quite
devoid
of
emotion
and
had
nothing
in
it
of
brummagen
moral
purpose
too
many
of
the
heretics
of
the
time
were
simply
orthodox
off
on
an
unaccustomed
tangent
in
their
disorderly
indignation
they
matched
the
regular
professors
it
was
only
in
the
objects
of
their
ranting
that
they
differed
but
ellis
kept
his
head
throughout
an
englishman
of
the
oldest
native
stock
an
unapologetic
lover
of
english
scenes
and
english
ways
an
unshaken
believer
in
the
essential
soundness
and
high
historical
destiny
of
his
people
he
simply
stood
aside
from
the
current
and
waited
in
patience
for
sense
and
decency
to
be
restored
his
impressions
and
comments
the
record
of
his
reflections
is
not
without
its
note
of
melancholy
it
was
hard
to
look
on
without
depression
but
for
the
man
of
genuine
culture
there
were
at
least
some
resources
remaining
within
himself
and
what
gives
this
volume
its
chief
value
is
its
picture
of
how
such
a
man
made
use
of
them
ellis
facing
the
mob
unleashed
turned
to
concerns
and
ideas
beyond
its
comprehension
to
the
humanism
that
stands
above
all
such
sordid
conflicts
there
is
something
almost
of
renaissance
dignity
in
his
chronicle
of
his
speculations
the
man
that
emerges
is
not
a
mere
scholar
immured
in
a
cell
but
a
man
of
the
world
superior
to
his
race
and
his
time
a
philosopher
viewing
the
childish
passion
of
lesser
men
disdainfully
and
yet
not
too
remote
to
understand
it
and
even
to
see
in
it
a
certain
cosmic
use
a
fine
air
blows
through
the
book
it
takes
the
reader
into
the
company
of
one
whose
mind
is
a
rich
library
and
whose
manner
is
that
of
a
gentleman
he
is
the
complete
in
him
the
huxleian
tradition
comes
to
full
flower
his
discourse
ranges
from
beethoven
to
comstockery
and
from
spanish
architecture
to
the
charm
of
the
english
village
the
extent
of
the
man
knowledge
is
really
quite
appalling
his
primary
work
in
the
world
has
been
that
of
a
psychologist
and
in
particular
he
has
brought
a
great
erudition
and
an
extraordinarily
sound
judgment
to
the
vexatious
problems
of
the
psychology
of
sex
but
that
professional
concern
extending
over
so
many
years
has
not
prevented
him
from
entering
a
dozen
other
domains
of
speculation
nor
has
it
dulled
his
sensitiveness
to
beauty
nor
his
capacity
to
evoke
it
his
writing
was
never
better
than
in
this
volume
his
style
especially
towards
the
end
takes
on
a
sort
of
glowing
clarity
it
is
english
that
is
as
transparent
as
a
crystal
and
yet
it
is
english
that
is
full
of
fine
colors
and
cadences
there
could
be
no
better
investiture
for
the
questionings
and
conclusions
of
so
original
so
curious
so
learned
and
above
all
so
sound
and
hearty
a
man
ix
the
nature
of
liberty
every
time
an
officer
of
the
constabulary
in
the
execution
of
his
just
and
awful
powers
under
american
law
produces
a
compound
fracture
of
the
occiput
of
some
citizen
in
his
custody
with
hemorrhage
shock
coma
and
death
there
comes
a
feeble
falsetto
protest
from
specialists
in
human
liberty
is
it
a
fact
without
significance
that
this
protest
is
never
supported
by
the
great
body
of
american
freemen
setting
aside
the
actual
heirs
and
creditors
of
the
victim
i
think
not
here
as
usual
public
opinion
is
very
realistic
it
does
not
rise
against
the
policeman
for
the
plain
and
simple
reason
that
it
does
not
question
his
right
to
do
what
he
has
done
policemen
are
not
given
for
ornament
they
are
given
them
for
the
purpose
of
cracking
the
skulls
of
the
recalcitrant
plain
people
democrats
and
republicans
alike
when
they
execute
that
high
duty
they
are
palpably
within
their
rights
the
specialists
aforesaid
are
the
same
fanatics
who
shake
the
air
with
sobs
every
time
the
of
the
united
states
bars
a
periodical
from
the
mails
because
its
ideas
do
not
please
him
and
every
time
some
poor
russian
is
deported
for
reading
karl
marx
and
every
time
a
prohibition
enforcement
officer
murders
a
bootlegger
who
resists
his
levies
and
every
time
agents
of
the
department
of
justice
throw
an
italian
out
of
the
window
and
every
time
the
ku
klux
klan
or
the
american
legion
tars
and
feathers
a
socialist
evangelist
in
brief
they
are
radicals
and
to
scratch
one
with
a
pitchfork
is
to
expose
a
bolshevik
they
are
men
standing
in
contempt
of
american
institutions
and
in
enmity
to
american
idealism
and
their
evil
principles
are
no
less
offensive
to
and
americans
when
they
are
united
states
senators
or
editors
of
wealthy
newspapers
than
when
they
are
degraded
throwing
dead
cats
and
infernal
machines
into
meetings
of
the
rotary
club
what
ails
them
primarily
is
the
ignorant
and
uncritical
monomania
that
afflicts
every
sort
of
fanatic
at
all
times
and
everywhere
having
mastered
with
their
limited
faculties
the
theoretical
principles
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
rights
they
work
themselves
into
a
passionate
conviction
that
those
principles
are
identical
with
the
rules
of
law
and
justice
and
ought
to
be
enforced
literally
and
without
the
slightest
regard
for
circumstance
and
expediency
it
is
precisely
as
if
a
high
church
rector
accidentally
looking
into
the
book
of
chronicles
and
especially
chapter
ii
should
suddenly
issue
a
mandate
from
his
pulpit
ordering
his
parishioners
on
penalty
of
excommunication
and
the
fires
of
hell
to
follow
exactly
the
example
set
forth
to
wit
and
jesse
begat
his
first
born
eliab
and
abinadab
the
second
and
shimma
the
third
netheneel
the
fourth
raddai
the
fifth
ozen
the
sixth
david
the
seventh
and
so
on
it
might
be
very
sound
theoretical
theology
but
it
would
surely
be
out
of
harmony
with
modern
ideas
and
the
rev
gentleman
would
be
extremely
lucky
if
the
bishop
did
not
give
him
days
in
the
diocesan
hoosegow
so
with
the
bill
of
rights
as
adopted
by
the
fathers
of
the
republic
it
was
gross
crude
inelastic
a
bit
fanciful
and
transcendental
it
specified
the
rights
of
a
citizen
but
it
said
nothing
whatever
about
his
duties
since
then
by
the
orderly
processes
of
legislative
science
and
by
the
even
more
subtle
and
beautiful
devices
of
juridic
art
it
has
been
kneaded
and
mellowed
into
a
far
greater
pliability
and
reasonableness
on
the
one
hand
the
citizen
still
retains
the
great
privilege
of
membership
in
the
most
superb
free
nation
ever
witnessed
on
this
earth
on
the
other
hand
as
a
result
of
countless
shrewd
enactments
and
sagacious
decisions
his
natural
lusts
and
appetites
are
held
in
laudable
check
and
he
is
thus
kept
in
order
and
decorum
no
artificial
impediment
stands
in
the
way
of
his
highest
aspiration
he
may
become
anything
including
even
a
policeman
but
once
a
policeman
he
is
protected
by
the
legislative
and
judicial
arms
in
the
peculiar
rights
and
prerogatives
that
go
with
his
high
office
including
especially
the
right
to
jug
the
laity
at
his
will
to
sweat
and
mug
them
to
subject
them
to
the
third
degree
and
to
subdue
their
resistance
by
beating
out
their
brains
those
who
are
unaware
of
this
are
simply
ignorant
of
the
basic
principles
of
american
jurisprudence
as
they
have
been
exposed
times
without
number
by
the
courts
of
first
instance
and
ratified
in
lofty
terms
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
one
aim
of
the
controlling
decisions
magnificently
attained
is
to
safeguard
public
order
and
the
public
security
and
to
substitute
a
judicial
process
for
the
inchoate
and
dangerous
interaction
of
discordant
egos
let
us
imagine
an
example
you
are
say
a
peaceable
citizen
on
your
way
home
from
your
place
of
employment
a
police
sergeant
detecting
you
in
the
crowd
approaches
you
lays
his
hand
on
your
collar
and
informs
you
that
you
are
under
arrest
for
killing
a
trolley
conductor
in
altoona
in
amazed
by
the
accusation
you
decide
hastily
that
the
officer
has
lost
his
wits
and
take
to
your
heels
he
pursues
you
you
continue
to
run
he
draws
his
revolver
and
fires
at
you
he
misses
you
he
fires
again
and
fetches
you
in
the
leg
you
fall
and
he
is
upon
you
you
prepare
to
resist
his
apparently
maniacal
assault
he
beats
you
into
insensibility
with
his
espantoon
and
drags
you
to
the
patrol
box
arrived
at
the
watch
house
you
are
locked
in
a
room
with
five
detectives
and
for
six
hours
they
question
you
with
subtle
art
you
grow
angry
perhaps
robbed
of
your
customary
politeness
by
the
throbbing
in
your
head
and
leg
and
answer
tartly
they
knock
you
down
having
failed
to
wring
a
confession
from
you
they
lock
you
in
a
cell
and
leave
you
there
all
night
the
next
day
you
are
taken
to
police
headquarters
your
photograph
is
made
for
the
rogues
gallery
and
a
print
is
duly
deposited
in
the
section
labeled
murderers
you
are
then
carted
to
jail
and
locked
up
again
there
you
remain
until
the
trolley
conductor
wife
comes
down
from
altoona
to
identify
you
she
astonishes
the
police
by
saying
that
you
are
not
the
man
the
actual
murderer
it
appears
was
an
italian
after
holding
you
a
day
or
two
longer
to
search
your
house
for
stills
audit
your
income
tax
returns
and
investigate
the
chastity
of
your
wife
they
let
you
go
you
are
naturally
somewhat
irritated
by
your
experience
and
perhaps
your
wife
urges
you
to
seek
redress
well
what
are
your
remedies
if
you
are
a
firebrand
you
reach
out
absurdly
for
those
of
a
preposterous
nature
the
instant
jailing
of
the
sergeant
the
dismissal
of
the
police
commissioner
the
release
of
mooney
a
fair
trial
for
sacco
and
vanzetti
free
trade
with
russia
one
big
union
but
if
you
are
a
per
cent
american
and
respect
the
laws
and
institutions
of
your
country
you
send
for
your
solicitor
and
at
once
he
shows
you
just
how
far
your
rights
go
and
where
they
end
you
can
not
cause
the
arrest
of
the
sergeant
for
you
resisted
him
when
he
attempted
to
arrest
you
and
when
you
resisted
him
he
acquired
an
instant
right
to
take
you
by
force
you
can
not
proceed
against
him
for
accusing
you
falsely
for
he
has
a
right
to
make
summary
arrests
for
felony
and
the
courts
have
many
times
decided
that
a
public
officer
so
long
as
he
can
not
be
charged
with
corruption
or
malice
is
not
liable
for
errors
of
judgment
made
in
the
execution
of
his
sworn
duty
you
can
not
get
the
detectives
on
the
mat
for
when
they
questioned
you
you
were
a
prisoner
accused
of
murder
and
it
was
their
duty
and
their
right
to
do
so
you
can
not
sue
the
turnkey
at
the
watch
house
or
the
warden
at
the
jail
for
locking
you
up
for
they
received
your
body
as
the
law
says
in
a
lawful
and
regular
manner
and
would
have
been
liable
to
penalty
if
they
had
turned
you
loose
but
have
you
no
redress
whatever
no
rights
at
all
certainly
you
have
a
right
and
the
courts
have
jealously
guarded
it
you
have
a
clear
right
guaranteed
to
you
under
the
constitution
to
go
into
a
court
of
equity
and
apply
for
a
mandamus
requiring
the
to
cease
forthwith
to
expose
your
portrait
in
the
rogues
gallery
among
the
murderers
this
is
your
inalienable
right
and
no
man
or
men
on
earth
can
take
it
away
from
you
you
can
not
prevent
them
cherishing
your
portrait
in
their
secret
files
but
you
can
get
an
order
commanding
them
to
refrain
forever
from
exposing
it
to
the
gaze
of
idle
visitors
and
if
you
can
introduce
yourself
unseen
into
their
studio
and
prove
that
they
disregard
that
order
you
can
have
them
haled
into
court
for
contempt
and
fined
by
the
learned
judge
thus
the
law
statute
common
and
case
protects
the
free
american
against
injustice
it
is
ignorance
of
that
subtle
and
perfect
process
and
not
any
special
love
of
liberty
that
causes
radicals
of
kidney
to
rage
every
time
an
officer
of
the
in
the
simple
execution
of
his
duty
knocks
a
citizen
in
the
head
the
plainly
has
an
inherent
and
inalienable
right
to
knock
him
in
the
head
it
is
an
essential
part
of
his
general
prerogative
as
a
sworn
officer
of
the
public
peace
and
a
representative
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
he
may
true
enough
exercise
that
prerogative
in
a
manner
liable
to
challenge
on
the
ground
that
it
is
imprudent
and
lacking
in
sound
judgment
on
such
questions
reasonable
men
may
differ
but
it
must
be
obvious
that
the
sane
and
decorous
way
to
settle
differences
of
opinion
of
that
sort
is
not
by
public
outcry
and
florid
appeals
to
sentimentality
not
by
playing
to
class
consciousness
and
prejudice
but
by
an
orderly
resort
to
the
checks
and
remedies
superimposed
upon
the
bill
of
rights
by
the
calm
deliberation
and
austere
logic
of
the
courts
of
equity
the
law
protects
the
citizen
but
to
get
its
protection
he
must
show
due
respect
for
its
wise
and
delicate
processes
x
the
novel
an
unmistakable
flavor
of
effeminacy
hangs
about
the
novel
however
heroic
its
content
even
in
the
gaudy
tales
of
a
rex
beach
with
their
bold
projections
of
the
freudian
dreams
of
drivers
ku
kluxers
rotary
club
presidents
and
other
such
carnivora
there
is
a
subtle
something
that
suggests
painting
and
well
why
not
when
the
novel
in
the
form
that
we
know
arose
in
spain
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
aimed
very
frankly
at
the
emerging
women
of
the
castilian
seraglios
women
who
were
gradually
emancipating
themselves
from
the
darkness
of
the
later
middle
ages
but
had
not
yet
come
to
anything
even
remotely
approaching
the
worldly
experience
and
intellectual
curiosity
of
men
they
could
now
read
and
they
liked
to
practice
the
art
but
the
grand
literature
of
the
time
was
too
profound
for
them
and
too
somber
so
literary
confectioners
undertook
stuff
that
would
be
more
to
their
taste
and
the
modern
novel
was
born
a
single
plot
served
most
of
these
confectioners
it
became
and
remains
one
of
the
conventions
of
the
form
man
and
maid
meet
love
and
proceed
to
kiss
but
the
rest
must
wait
the
buss
remains
chaste
through
long
and
harrowing
chapters
not
until
the
very
last
scene
do
fate
and
holy
church
license
anything
more
this
plot
as
i
say
still
serves
and
arnold
bennett
is
authority
for
the
doctrine
that
it
is
the
safest
known
its
appeal
is
patently
to
the
feminine
fancy
not
to
the
masculine
women
like
to
be
wooed
endlessly
before
they
loose
their
girdles
and
are
wooed
no
more
but
a
man
when
he
finds
a
damsel
to
his
taste
is
eager
to
get
through
the
preliminary
as
soon
as
possible
that
women
are
still
the
chief
readers
of
novels
is
known
to
every
book
clerk
joseph
hergesheimer
a
little
while
back
was
bemoaning
the
fact
as
a
curse
to
his
craft
what
is
less
often
noted
is
that
women
themselves
as
they
have
gradually
become
fully
literate
have
forced
their
way
to
the
front
as
makers
of
the
stuff
they
feed
on
and
that
they
show
signs
of
ousting
the
men
soon
or
late
from
the
business
save
in
the
department
of
lyrical
verse
which
demands
no
organization
of
ideas
but
only
fluency
of
feeling
they
have
nowhere
else
done
serious
work
in
literature
there
is
no
epic
poem
of
any
solid
value
by
a
woman
dead
or
alive
and
no
drama
whether
comedy
or
tragedy
and
no
work
of
metaphysical
speculation
and
no
history
and
no
basic
document
in
any
other
realm
of
thought
in
criticism
whether
of
works
of
art
or
of
the
ideas
underlying
them
few
women
have
ever
got
beyond
the
of
madame
de
staël
in
the
essay
the
most
competent
woman
barely
surpasses
the
average
fleet
street
hack
or
harvard
professor
but
in
the
novel
the
ladies
have
stood
on
a
level
with
even
the
most
accomplished
men
since
the
day
of
jane
austen
and
not
only
in
but
also
everywhere
else
save
perhaps
in
russia
it
would
be
difficult
to
think
of
a
contemporary
german
novelist
of
sounder
dignity
than
clara
viebig
helene
böhlau
or
ricarda
huch
or
a
scandinavian
novelist
clearly
above
selma
lagerlöf
or
an
italian
above
mathilda
serao
or
for
that
matter
more
than
two
or
three
living
englishmen
above
may
sinclair
or
more
than
two
americans
equal
to
willa
cather
not
only
are
women
writing
novels
quite
as
good
as
those
written
by
men
setting
aside
of
course
a
few
miraculous
pieces
by
such
fellows
as
joseph
conrad
most
of
them
not
really
novels
at
all
but
metaphysical
sonatas
disguised
as
romances
they
are
actually
surpassing
men
in
their
experimental
development
of
the
novel
form
i
do
not
believe
that
either
evelyn
scott
the
narrow
house
or
may
sinclair
life
and
death
of
harriet
frean
has
the
depth
and
beam
of
say
dreiser
jennie
gerhardt
or
arnold
bennett
old
wives
tale
but
it
is
certainly
to
be
argued
plausibly
that
both
books
show
a
far
greater
venturesomeness
and
a
far
finer
virtuosity
in
the
novel
form
that
both
seek
to
free
that
form
from
artificialities
which
dreiser
and
bennett
seem
to
be
almost
unaware
of
when
men
exhibit
any
discontent
with
those
artificialities
it
usually
takes
the
shape
of
a
vain
and
uncouth
revolt
against
the
whole
inner
spirit
of
the
novel
that
is
against
the
characteristics
which
make
it
what
it
is
their
lusher
imagination
tempts
them
to
try
to
convert
it
into
something
that
it
is
for
example
an
epic
a
political
document
or
a
philosophical
work
this
fact
explains
in
one
direction
such
dialectical
parables
as
dreiser
the
wells
joan
and
peter
and
upton
sinclair
king
coal
and
in
a
quite
different
direction
such
rhapsodies
as
cabell
jurgen
meredith
the
shaving
of
shagpat
and
jacob
wassermann
the
illusion
these
things
are
novels
only
in
the
very
limited
sense
that
beethoven
vittoria
and
goldmarck
ländliche
hochzeit
are
symphonies
their
chief
purpose
is
not
that
of
prose
fiction
it
is
either
that
of
argumentation
or
that
of
poetry
the
women
novelists
with
very
few
exceptions
are
far
more
careful
to
remain
within
the
legitimate
bounds
of
the
form
they
do
not
often
abandon
representation
to
exhort
or
exult
miss
cather
my
antonia
shows
a
great
deal
of
originality
in
its
method
the
story
it
tells
is
certainly
not
a
conventional
one
nor
is
it
told
in
a
conventional
way
but
it
remains
a
novel
none
the
less
and
as
clearly
so
in
fact
as
the
ordeal
of
richard
feverel
or
robinson
crusoe
much
exertion
of
the
laryngeal
and
respiratory
muscles
is
wasted
upon
a
discussion
of
the
differences
between
realistic
novels
and
romantic
novels
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
authentic
novel
is
realistic
in
its
method
however
fantastic
it
may
be
in
its
fable
the
primary
aim
of
the
novel
at
all
times
and
everywhere
is
the
representation
of
human
beings
at
their
follies
and
villainies
and
no
other
art
form
clings
to
that
aim
so
faithfully
it
sets
forth
not
what
might
be
true
or
what
ought
to
be
true
but
what
actually
true
this
is
obviously
not
the
case
with
poetry
poetry
is
the
product
of
an
effort
to
invent
a
world
appreciably
better
than
the
one
we
live
in
its
essence
is
not
the
representation
of
the
facts
but
the
deliberate
concealment
and
denial
of
the
facts
as
for
the
drama
it
vacillates
and
if
it
touches
the
novel
on
one
side
it
also
touches
the
epic
on
the
other
but
the
novel
is
concerned
solely
with
human
nature
as
it
is
practically
revealed
and
with
human
experience
as
men
actually
know
it
if
it
departs
from
that
representational
fidelity
ever
so
slightly
it
becomes
to
that
extent
a
bad
novel
if
it
departs
violently
it
ceases
to
be
a
novel
at
all
cabell
who
shows
all
the
critical
deficiencies
of
a
sound
artist
is
one
who
has
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
questioning
the
uses
of
realism
yet
it
is
a
plain
fact
that
his
own
stature
as
an
artist
depends
almost
wholly
upon
his
capacity
for
accurate
observation
and
realistic
representation
the
stories
in
the
line
of
love
though
they
may
appear
superficially
to
be
excessively
romantic
really
owe
all
of
their
charm
to
their
pungent
realism
the
pleasure
they
give
is
the
pleasure
of
recognition
one
somehow
delights
in
seeing
a
mediæval
baron
acting
precisely
like
a
new
york
stockbroker
as
for
jurgen
it
is
as
realistic
in
manner
as
zola
la
terre
despite
its
grotesque
fable
and
its
burden
of
political
theological
and
epistemological
ideas
no
one
not
an
idiot
would
mistake
the
dialogue
between
jurgen
and
queen
guinevere
father
for
romantic
in
the
sense
that
mandalay
is
romantic
it
is
actually
as
mordantly
realistic
as
the
dialogue
between
nora
and
helmer
in
the
last
act
of
a
doll
house
it
is
my
contention
that
women
succeed
in
the
novel
and
that
they
will
succeed
even
more
strikingly
as
they
gradually
throw
off
the
inhibitions
that
have
hitherto
cobwebbed
their
minds
simply
because
they
are
better
fitted
for
this
realistic
representation
than
men
because
they
see
the
facts
of
life
more
sharply
and
are
less
distracted
by
mooney
dreams
women
seldom
have
the
pathological
faculty
vaguely
called
imagination
one
does
often
hear
of
them
groaning
over
colossal
bones
in
their
sleep
as
dogs
do
or
constructing
heavenly
hierarchies
or
political
utopias
as
men
do
their
concern
is
always
with
things
of
more
objective
substance
roofs
meals
rent
clothes
the
birth
and
upbringing
of
children
they
are
i
believe
generally
happier
than
men
if
only
because
the
demands
they
make
of
life
are
more
moderate
and
less
romantic
the
chief
pain
that
a
man
normally
suffers
in
his
progress
through
this
vale
is
that
of
disillusionment
the
chief
pain
that
a
woman
suffers
is
that
of
parturition
there
is
enormous
significance
in
the
difference
the
first
is
artificial
and
the
second
is
natural
and
unescapable
the
psychological
history
of
the
differentiation
i
need
not
go
into
here
its
springs
lie
obviously
in
the
greater
physical
strength
of
man
and
his
freedom
from
and
in
the
larger
mobility
and
capacity
for
adventure
that
go
therewith
a
man
dreams
of
utopias
simply
because
he
feels
himself
free
to
construct
them
a
woman
must
keep
house
in
late
years
to
be
sure
she
has
toyed
with
the
idea
of
escaping
that
necessity
but
i
shall
not
bore
you
with
arguments
showing
that
she
never
will
so
long
as
children
are
brought
into
the
world
and
made
ready
for
the
trenches
the
and
the
gallows
by
the
laborious
method
ordained
of
god
she
will
never
be
quite
as
free
to
roam
and
dream
as
man
is
it
is
only
a
small
minority
of
her
sex
who
cherish
a
contrary
expectation
and
this
minority
though
anatomically
female
is
spiritually
male
show
me
a
woman
who
has
visions
comparable
say
to
those
of
swedenborg
woodrow
wilson
strindberg
or
ghandi
and
i
show
you
a
woman
who
is
a
very
powerful
anaphrodisiac
thus
women
by
their
enforced
preoccupation
with
the
harsh
facts
of
life
are
extremely
well
fitted
to
write
novels
which
must
deal
with
the
facts
or
nothing
what
they
need
for
the
practical
business
in
addition
falls
under
two
heads
first
they
need
enough
sense
of
social
security
to
make
them
free
to
set
down
what
they
see
secondly
they
need
the
modest
technical
skill
the
formal
mastery
of
words
and
ideas
necessary
to
do
it
the
latter
i
believe
they
have
had
ever
since
they
learned
to
read
and
write
say
three
hundred
years
ago
it
comes
to
them
more
readily
than
to
men
and
is
exercised
with
greater
ease
the
former
they
are
fast
acquiring
in
the
days
of
aphra
behn
and
ann
radcliffe
it
was
almost
as
scandalous
for
a
woman
to
put
her
observations
and
notions
into
print
as
it
was
for
her
to
show
her
legs
even
in
the
days
of
jane
austen
and
charlotte
brontë
the
thing
was
regarded
as
decidedly
unladylike
but
now
within
certain
limits
she
is
free
to
print
whatever
she
pleases
and
before
long
even
those
surviving
limits
will
be
obliterated
if
i
live
to
the
year
i
expect
to
see
a
novel
by
a
women
that
will
describe
a
typical
marriage
under
christianity
from
the
woman
standpoint
as
realistically
as
it
is
treated
from
the
man
standpoint
in
upton
sinclair
pilgrimage
that
novel
i
venture
to
predict
will
be
a
cuckoo
at
one
stroke
it
will
demolish
superstitions
that
have
prevailed
in
the
western
world
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
it
will
seem
harsh
but
it
will
be
true
and
being
true
it
will
be
a
good
novel
there
can
be
no
good
one
that
is
not
true
what
ailed
the
women
novelists
until
very
recently
was
a
lingering
ladyism
a
childish
prudery
inherited
from
their
mothers
i
believe
that
it
is
being
rapidly
thrown
off
indeed
one
often
sees
a
concrete
woman
novelist
shedding
it
i
give
you
two
obvious
examples
zona
gale
and
willa
cather
miss
gale
started
out
by
trying
to
put
into
novels
the
conventional
prettiness
that
is
esteemed
along
the
main
streets
of
her
native
wisconsin
she
had
skill
and
did
it
well
and
so
she
won
a
good
deal
of
popular
success
but
her
work
was
intrinsically
as
worthless
as
a
treatise
on
international
politics
by
the
hon
warren
gamaliel
harding
or
a
tract
on
the
duties
of
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
by
a
state
president
of
the
american
legion
then
of
a
sudden
for
some
reason
quite
unknown
to
the
deponent
she
threw
off
all
that
flabby
artificiality
and
began
describing
the
people
about
her
as
they
really
were
the
result
was
a
second
success
even
more
pronounced
than
her
first
and
on
a
palpably
higher
level
the
career
of
miss
cather
has
covered
less
ground
for
she
began
far
above
main
street
what
she
tried
to
do
at
the
start
was
to
imitate
the
superficial
sophistication
of
edith
wharton
and
henry
james
a
deceptive
thing
apparently
realistic
in
essence
but
actually
as
conventional
as
table
manners
or
the
professional
buffooneries
of
a
fashionable
rector
miss
cather
had
extraordinary
skill
as
a
writer
and
so
her
imitation
was
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
original
but
in
the
course
of
time
she
began
to
be
aware
of
its
hollowness
then
she
turned
to
representation
to
pictures
of
the
people
she
actually
knew
there
ensued
a
series
of
novels
that
rose
step
by
step
to
the
very
distinguished
quality
of
my
antonia
that
fine
piece
is
a
great
deal
more
than
simply
a
good
novel
it
is
a
document
in
the
history
of
american
literature
it
proves
once
and
for
all
time
that
accurate
representation
is
not
as
the
campus
critics
of
dreiser
seem
to
think
inimical
to
beauty
it
proves
on
the
contrary
that
the
most
careful
and
penetrating
representation
is
itself
the
source
of
a
rare
and
wonderful
beauty
no
romantic
novel
ever
written
in
america
by
man
or
woman
is
so
beautiful
as
my
antonia
as
i
have
said
the
novel
in
the
united
states
as
elsewhere
still
radiates
an
aroma
of
effeminacy
in
the
conventional
sense
specifically
it
deals
too
monotonously
with
the
varieties
of
human
transactions
which
chiefly
interest
the
unintelligent
women
who
are
its
chief
patrons
and
the
scarcely
less
intelligent
women
who
until
recently
were
among
its
chief
commercial
manufacturers
to
wit
the
transactions
that
revolve
around
the
ensnarement
of
men
by
women
the
puerile
tricks
and
conflicts
of
what
is
absurdly
called
romantic
love
but
i
believe
that
the
women
novelists
as
they
emerge
into
the
fullness
of
skill
will
throw
overboard
all
that
old
baggage
and
leave
its
toting
to
such
male
artisans
as
chambers
beach
coningsby
dawson
and
emerson
hough
as
they
have
already
left
the
whole
and
buncombe
true
enough
the
snaring
of
men
will
remain
the
principal
business
of
women
in
this
world
for
many
generations
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
intelligent
women
even
view
it
romantically
that
is
as
it
is
viewed
by
bad
novelists
they
see
it
realistically
and
they
see
it
not
as
an
end
in
itself
but
as
a
means
to
other
ends
it
is
speaking
generally
after
she
has
got
her
man
that
a
woman
begins
to
live
the
novel
of
the
future
i
believe
will
show
her
thus
living
it
will
depict
the
intricate
complex
of
forces
that
conditions
her
life
and
generates
her
ideas
and
it
will
show
against
a
background
of
actuality
her
conduct
in
the
eternal
struggle
between
her
aspiration
and
her
destiny
women
as
i
have
argued
are
not
normally
harassed
by
the
grandiose
and
otiose
visions
that
inflame
the
gizzards
of
men
but
they
too
discover
inevitably
that
life
is
a
conflict
and
that
it
is
the
harsh
fate
of
to
get
the
worst
of
it
i
should
like
to
read
a
main
street
by
an
articulate
carol
kennicott
or
a
titan
by
one
of
cowperwood
mistresses
or
a
cytherea
by
a
fanny
randon
or
a
savina
grove
it
would
be
sweet
stuff
indeed
and
it
will
come
xi
the
when
the
history
of
the
late
years
in
america
is
written
i
suspect
that
their
grandest
gaudiest
gifts
to
will
be
found
in
the
incomparable
twins
the
and
the
no
other
nation
can
match
them
at
any
weight
the
is
privy
to
all
god
wishes
and
even
whims
the
is
the
heir
to
all
his
promises
to
the
righteous
the
former
is
never
wrong
the
latter
is
never
despairing
sometimes
the
two
are
amalgamated
into
one
man
and
we
have
a
bryan
a
wilson
a
frank
crane
but
more
often
there
is
a
division
the
thinks
wrong
and
the
looks
backward
i
give
you
upton
sinclair
and
nicholas
murray
butler
as
examples
butler
is
an
absolute
masterpiece
of
correct
thought
in
his
whole
life
so
far
as
human
records
show
he
has
not
cherished
a
single
fancy
that
might
not
have
been
voiced
by
a
fifth
avenue
rector
or
spread
upon
the
editorial
page
of
the
new
york
but
he
has
no
vision
alas
alas
all
the
revolutionary
inventions
for
lifting
up
humanity
leave
him
cold
he
is
against
them
all
from
the
initiative
and
referendum
to
birth
control
and
from
fletcherism
to
osteopathy
now
turn
to
sinclair
he
believes
in
every
one
of
them
however
daring
and
fantoddish
he
grasps
and
gobbles
all
the
new
ones
the
instant
they
are
announced
but
the
man
simply
can
not
think
right
he
is
wrong
on
politics
on
economics
and
on
theology
he
glories
in
and
is
intensely
vain
of
his
wrongness
let
but
a
new
article
of
correct
american
thought
get
itself
stated
by
the
constituted
ecclesiastical
and
secular
authorities
by
bishop
manning
or
judge
gary
or
butler
or
adolph
ochs
or
fabian
franklin
or
otto
kahn
or
stephen
wise
or
roger
babson
or
any
other
such
inspired
omphalist
and
he
is
against
it
almost
before
it
is
stated
on
the
whole
as
a
neutral
in
such
matters
i
prefer
the
to
the
if
only
because
he
shows
more
courage
and
originality
it
takes
nothing
save
lack
of
humor
to
believe
what
butler
or
ochs
or
bishop
manning
believes
but
it
takes
long
practice
and
a
considerable
natural
gift
to
get
down
the
beliefs
of
sinclair
i
remember
with
great
joy
the
magazine
that
he
used
to
issue
during
the
war
in
the
very
first
issue
he
advocated
socialism
the
single
tax
birth
control
communism
the
league
of
nations
the
conscription
of
wealth
government
ownership
of
coal
mines
sex
hygiene
and
free
trade
in
the
next
issue
he
added
the
recall
of
judges
fletcherism
the
gary
system
the
montessori
method
cookery
war
gardens
and
the
budget
system
in
the
third
he
came
out
for
sex
hygiene
one
big
union
the
initiative
and
referendum
the
city
manager
plan
chiropractic
and
esperanto
in
the
fourth
he
went
to
the
direct
primary
fasting
the
third
international
a
federal
divorce
law
free
motherhood
hot
lunches
for
school
children
prohibition
the
vice
crusade
the
government
control
of
newspapers
deep
breathing
international
courts
the
fourteen
points
freedom
for
the
armenians
the
limitation
of
campaign
expenditures
the
merit
system
the
abolition
of
the
new
york
stock

psychoanalysis
the
little
theater
movement
the
recognition
of
mexico
libre
old
age
pensions
unemployment

cooperative

the

of

the
americanization
of
the

mental

the
abolition
of

federal

in

a
prohibitive
tax
on
poms
the
campaign
relief
for
the
jews
osteopathy
mental
mastery
and
the
twilight
sleep
and
so
on
and
so
on
once
i
had
got
into
the
swing
of
the
sinclair
monthly
i
found
that
i
could
dispense
with
at
least
twenty
other
journals
of
the
uplift
when
he
abandoned
it
i
had
to
subscribe
for
them
anew
and
the
gravel
has
stuck
in
my
craw
ever
since
in
the
first
volume
of
his
personal
philosophy
the
book
of
life
mind
and
body
he
is
stopped
from
displaying
whole
categories
of
his
ideas
for
his
subject
is
not
man
the
political
and
economic
machine
but
man
and
mammal
nevertheless
his
characteristic
hospitality
to
new
revelations
is
abundantly
visible
what
does
the
mind
suggest
the
mind
suggests
its
dark
and
fascinating
functions
and
powers
some
of
them
very
recent
there
is
for
example
psychoanalysis
there
is
mental
telepathy
there
is
there
is
double
personality
out
of
each
springs
a
scheme
for
the
uplift
of
the
race
in
each
there
is
something
for
a
to
get
his
teeth
into
and
if
mind
then
why
not
also
spirit
here
even
a
may
hesitate
here
in
fact
sinclair
himself
hesitates
the
whole
field
of
spiritism
is
barred
to
him
by
his
theological
heterodoxy
if
he
admits
that
man
has
an
immortal
soul
he
may
also
have
to
admit
that
the
soul
can
suffer
in
hell
thus
even
may
turn
upon
and
devour
itself
but
if
the
meadow
wherein
spooks
and
poltergeists
disport
is
closed
it
is
at
least
possible
to
peep
over
the
fence
sinclair
sees
materializations
in
dark
rooms
under
red
satanic
lights
he
is
perhaps
not
yet
convinced
but
he
is
looking
pretty
hard
let
a
ghostly
hand
reach
out
and
grab
him
and
he
will
be
over
the
fence
the
body
is
easier
the
new
inventions
for
dealing
with
it
are
innumerable
and
irresistible
no
can
fail
to
succumb
to
at
least
some
of
them
sinclair
teeters
dizzily
on
the
one
hand
he
stoutly
defends
surgery
that
is
provided
the
patient
is
allowed
to
make
his
own
diagnosis
on
the
other
hand
he
is
hot
for
fasting
teetotalism
and
the
avoidance
of
drugs
coffee
and
tobacco
and
he
begins
to
flirt
with
osteopathy
and
chiropractic
more
he
has
discovered
a
new
revelation
in
san
francisco
a
system
of
diagnosis
and
therapeutics
still
hooted
at
by
the
medical
trust
whereby
the
exact
location
of
a
cancer
may
be
determined
by
examining
a
few
drops
of
the
patient
blood
and
syphilis
may
be
cured
by
vibrations
and
whereby
most
curious
of
all
it
can
be
established
that
odd
numbers
written
on
a
sheet
of
paper
are
full
of
negative
electricity
and
even
numbers
are
full
of
positive
electricity
the
book
is
written
with
great
confidence
and
address
and
has
a
good
deal
of
shrewdness
mixed
with
its
credulities
few
licensed
medical
practitioners
could
give
you
better
advice
but
it
is
less
interesting
than
its
author
or
indeed
than
in
general
of
all
the
known
orders
of
men
they
fascinate
me
the
most
i
spend
whole
days
reading
their
pronunciamentos
and
am
an
expert
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
their
singularly
bizarre
ideas
as
i
have
said
i
have
never
encountered
one
who
believed
in
but
one
sure
cure
for
all
the
sorrows
of
the
world
and
let
it
go
at
that
nay
even
the
most
timorous
of
them
gives
his
full
faith
and
credit
to
at
least
two
turn
for
example
to
the
official
list
of
eminent
single

by
the

i
defy
you
to
find
one
solitary
man
on
it

stops
with

no

as
well
as
i
do

among
such
sad
mad
glad
folks
and
know
some
of
them
very
well
it
is
my
belief
that
the
majority
or
them
are
absolutely
honest
that
they
believe
as
fully
in
their
baroque
gospels
as
i
believe
in
the
dishonesty
of
politicians
that
their
myriad
and
amazing
faiths
sit
upon
them
as
heavily
as
the
fear
of
hell
sits
upon
a
methodist
deacon
who
has
degraded
the
to
carnal
uses
all
that
may
be
justly
said
against
them
is
that
they
are
chronically
full
of
hope
and
hence
chronically
uneasy
and
indignant
that
they
belong
to
the
less
sinful
and
comfortable
of
the
two
grand
divisions
of
the
human
race
call
them
the
as
the
late
william
james
used
to
do
and
you
have
pretty
well
described
them
they
are
on
the
one
hand
pathologically
sensitive
to
the
sorrows
of
the
world
and
on
the
other
hand
pathologically
susceptible
to
the
eloquence
of
quacks
what
seems
to
lie
in
all
of
them
is
the
doctrine
that
evils
so
vast
as
those
they
see
about
them
and
be
laid
that
it
would
be
an
insult
to
a
just
god
to
think
of
them
as
permanent
and
irremediable
this
notion
i
believe
is
at
the
bottom
of
much
of
the
current
pathetic
faith
in
prohibition
the
thing
itself
is
obviously
a
colossal
failure
that
is
when
viewed
calmly
and
realistically
it
has
not
only
not
cured
the
rum
evil
in
the
united
states
it
has
plainly
made
that
evil
five
times
as
bad
as
it
ever
was
before
but
to
confess
that
bald
fact
would
be
to
break
the
heart
it
simply
refuses
to
harbor
the
concept
of
the
incurable
and
so
being
debarred
by
the
legal
machinery
that
supports
prohibition
from
going
back
to
any
more
feasible
scheme
of
relief
it
cherishes
the
sorry
faith
that
somehow
in
some
vague
and
incomprehensible
way
prohibition
will
yet
work
when
the
truth
becomes
so
horribly
evident
that
even
are
daunted
then
some
new
quack
will
arise
to
fool
them
again
with
some
new
and
worse
scheme
of
it
is
their
destiny
to
wobble
thus
endlessly
between
quack
and
quack
one
pulls
them
by
the
right
arm
and
one
by
the
left
arm
a
third
is
at
their
pockets
and
a
fourth
beckons
them
over
the
hill
the
rest
of
us
are
less
and
in
consequence
much
happier
we
observe
quite
clearly
that
the
world
as
it
stands
is
anything
but
perfect
that
injustice
exists
and
turmoil
and
tragedy
and
bitter
suffering
of
ten
thousand
kinds
that
human
life
at
its
best
is
anything
but
a
grand
sweet
song
but
instead
of
ranting
absurdly
against
the
fact
or
weeping
over
it
maudlinly
or
trying
to
remedy
it
with
inadequate
means
we
simply
put
the
thought
of
it
out
of
our
minds
just
as
a
wise
man
puts
away
the
thought
that
alcohol
is
probably
bad
for
his
liver
or
that
his
wife
is
a
shade
too
fat
instead
of
mulling
over
it
and
suffering
from
it
we
seek
contentment
by
pursuing
the
delights
that
are
so
strangely
mixed
with
the
horrors
by
seeking
out
the
soft
spots
and
endeavoring
to
avoid
the
hard
spots
such
is
the
intelligent
habit
of
practical
and
sinful
men
and
under
it
lies
a
sound
philosophy
after
all
the
world
is
not
our
handiwork
and
we
are
not
responsible
for
what
goes
on
in
it
save
within
very
narrow
limits
going
outside
them
with
our
protests
and
advice
tends
to
become
contumacy
to
the
celestial
hierarchy
do
the
poor
suffer
in
the
midst
of
plenty
then
let
us
thank
god
politely
that
we
are
not
that
poor
are
rogues
in
offices
well
go
call
a
policeman
thus
setting
rogue
upon
rogue
are
taxes
onerous
wasteful
unjust
then
let
us
dodge
as
large
a
part
of
them
as
we
can
are
whole
regiments
and
army
corps
of
our
fellow
creatures
doomed
to
hell
then
let
them
complain
to
the
archangels
and
if
the
archangels
are
too
busy
to
hear
them
to
the
nearest
archbishop
unluckily
for
the
man
of
tender
mind
he
is
quite
incapable
of
any
such
easy
dismissal
of
the
great
plagues
and
conundrums
of
existence
it
is
of
the
essence
of
his
character
that
he
is
too
sensitive
and
sentimental
to
put
them
ruthlessly
out
of
his
mind
he
can
not
view
even
the
crunching
of
a
cockroach
without
feeling
the
snapping
of
his
own
ribs
and
it
is
of
the
essence
of
his
character
that
he
is
unable
to
escape
the
delusion
of
duty
that
he
ca
rid
himself
of
the
notion
that
whenever
he
observes
anything
in
the
world
that
might
conceivably
be
improved
he
is
commanded
by
god
to
make
every
effort
to
improve
it
in
brief
he
is
a
man
and
the
ideal
citizen
of
democratic
states
but
nature
it
must
be
obvious
is
opposed
to
democracy
and
whoso
goes
counter
to
nature
must
expect
to
pay
the
penalty
the
man
pays
it
by
hanging
forever
upon
the
cruel
hooks
of
hope
and
by
fermenting
inwardly
in
incessant
indignation
all
this
perhaps
explains
the
notorious
of
uplifters
the
wowser
touch
that
is
in
even
the
best
of
them
they
dwell
so
much
upon
the
imperfections
of
the
universe
and
the
weaknesses
of
man
that
they
end
by
believing
that
the
universe
is
altogether
out
of
joint
and
that
every
man
is
a
scoundrel
and
every
woman
a
vampire
years
ago
i
had
a
combat
with
certain
eminent
reformers
of
the
sex
hygiene
and
vice
crusading
species
and
got
out
of
it
a
memorable
illumination
of
their
private
minds
the
reform
these
strange
creatures
were
then
advocating
was
directed
against
sins
of
the
seventh
category
and
they
proposed
to
put
them
down
by
forcing
through
legislation
of
a
very
harsh
and
fantastic
kind
statutes
forbidding
any
woman
however
forbidding
to
entertain
a
man
in
her
apartment
without
the
presence
of
a
third
party
statutes
providing
for
the
garish
lighting
of
all
dark
places
in
the
public
parks
and
so
on
in
the
course
of
my
debates
with
them
i
gradually
jockeyed
them
into
abandoning
all
of
the
arguments
they
started
with
and
so
brought
them
down
to
their
fundamental
doctrine
to
wit
that
no
woman
without
the
aid
of
the
police
could
be
trusted
to
protect
her
virtue
i
pass
as
a
cynic
in
christian
circles
but
this
notion
certainly
gave
me
pause
and
it
was
voiced
by
men
who
were
the
fathers
of
grown
and
unmarried
daughters
it
is
no
wonder
that
men
who
cherish
such
ideas
are
so
ready
to
accept
any
remedy
for
the
underlying
evils
no
matter
how
grotesque
a
man
suffering
from
as
every
one
knows
will
take
any
medicine
that
is
offered
to
him
even
though
he
knows
the
compounder
to
be
a
quack
the
infinitesimal
chance
that
the
quack
may
have
the
impossible
cure
gives
him
a
certain
hope
and
so
makes
the
disease
itself
more
bearable
in
precisely
the
same
way
a
man
suffering
from
the
conviction
that
the
whole
universe
is
for
destruction
that
the
government
he
lives
under
is
intolerably
evil
that
the
rich
are
growing
richer
and
the
poor
poorer
that
no
man
word
can
be
trusted
and
no
woman
chastity
that
another
and
worse
war
is
hatching
that
the
very
regulation
of
the
weather
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
rogues
such
a
man
will
grab
at
anything
even
birth
control
osteopathy
or
the
fourteen
points
rather
than
let
the
foul
villainy
go
on
the
apparent
necessity
of
finding
a
remedy
without
delay
transforms
itself
by
an
easy
psychological
process
into
a
belief
that
the
remedy
has
been
found
it
is
almost
impossible
for
most
men
and
particularly
for
men
to
take
in
the
concept
of
the
insoluble
every
problem
that
remains
unsolved
including
even
the
problem
of
evil
is
in
that
state
simply
because
men
of
strict
virtue
and
passionate
altruism
have
not
combined
to
solve
it
because
the
business
has
been
neglected
by
human
laziness
and
rascality
all
that
is
needed
to
dispatch
it
is
the
united
effort
of
enough
pure
hearts
the
accursed
nature
of
things
will
yield
inevitably
to
a
sufficiently
desperate
battle
mind
usually
written
mind
will
triumph
over
matter
usually
written
matter
or
maybe
money
power
or
land
monopoly
or
beef
trust
or
conspiracy
of
silence
or
commercialized
vice
or
wall
street
or
the
dukes
or
the
kaiser
and
the
kingdom
of
god
will
be
at
hand
so
with
the
will
to
believe
in
full
function
the
rest
is
easy
the
eager
is
exactly
like
the
man
with
or
arthritis
or
nervous
dyspepsia
or
diabetes
it
takes
time
to
try
each
successive
remedy
to
search
it
out
to
take
it
to
observe
its
effects
to
hope
to
doubt
to
shelve
it
before
the
process
is
completed
another
is
offered
new
ones
are
always
waiting
before
their
predecessors
have
been
discarded
here
perhaps
we
get
a
glimpse
of
the
causes
behind
the
protean
appetite
of
the
true
his
virtuosity
in
credulity
he
is
in
all
stages
simultaneously
just
getting
over
the
initiative
and
referendum
beginning
to
have
doubts
about
the
short
ballot
making
ready
for
a
horse
doctor
dose
of
the
single
tax
and
contemplating
an
experimental
draught
of
socialism
what
is
to
be
done
for
him
how
is
he
to
be
cured
of
his
great
thirst
for
that
do
not
cure
and
converted
into
a
contented
and
careless
peacefully
snoozing
beneath
his
fig
tree
while
the
oppressed
bawl
for
succor
in
forty
abandoned
lands
and
injustice
stalks
the
world
and
taxes
mount
higher
and
higher
and
poor
are
sold
into
white
slavery
and
prohibition
fails
to
prohibit
and
cocaine
is
hawked
openly
and
jazz
drags
millions
down
the
primrose
way
and
the
trusts
own
the
legislatures
of
all
christendom
and
judges
go
to
dinner
with
millionaires
and
europe
prepares
for
another
war
and
children
of
four
and
five
years
work
as
stevedores
and
locomotive
firemen
and
guinea
pigs
and
dogs
are
vivisected
and
polish
immigrant
women
have
more
children
every
year
and
divorces
multiply
and
materialism
rages
and
the
devil
runs
the
cosmos
what
is
to
be
done
to
save
the
from
his
torturing
indignations
and
set
him
in
paths
of
happy
dalliance
answer
nothing
he
was
born
that
way
as
men
are
born
with
hare
lips
or
bad
livers
and
he
will
remain
that
way
until
the
angels
summon
him
to
eternal
rest
destiny
has
laid
upon
him
the
burden
of
seeing
unescapably
what
had
better
not
be
looked
at
of
believing
what
so
there
is
no
way
to
help
him
he
must
suffer
vicariously
for
the
carnal
ease
of
the
rest
of
us
he
must
die
daily
that
we
may
live
in
peace
corrupt
and
contented
as
i
have
said
i
believe
fully
that
this
child
of
sorrow
is
honest
that
his
twinges
and
malaises
are
just
as
real
to
him
as
those
that
rack
the
man
with
arthritis
and
that
his
trusting
faith
in
quacks
is
just
as
natural
but
this
of
course
is
not
saying
that
the
quacks
themselves
are
honest
on
the
contrary
their
utter
dishonesty
must
be
quite
as
obvious
as
the
simplicity
of
their
dupes
trade
is
good
for
them
in
the
united
states
where
hope
is
a
sort
of
national
vice
and
so
they
flourish
here
more
luxuriously
than
anywhere
else
on
earth
some
one
told
me
lately
that
there
are
now
no
less
than
national
organizations
in
the
united
states
for
the
uplift
of
the
plain
people
and
the
snaring
and
shaking
down
of
societies
for
the
americanization
of
immigrants
for
protecting
poor
against
jews
and
italians
for
putting
bibles
into
the
bedrooms
of
hotels
for
teaching
polish
women
how
to
wash
their
babies
for
instructing
in
for
crusading
against
the
cigarette
for
preventing
accidents
in
for
making
conductors
more
polite
for
testing
the
mentality
of
for
teaching
for
restoring
the
united
states
to
great
britain
for
building
in
the
devastated
regions
of
france
for
training
deaconesses
for
fighting
the
for
preventing
cruelty
to
mules
and
for
forcing
householders
to
clean
their
backyards
for
planting
trees
for
saving
the
indian
for
sending
colored
boys
to
harvard
for
opposing
sunday
movies
for
censoring
magazines
for
god
knows
what
else
in
every
large
american
city
such
organizations
swarm
and
every
one
of
them
has
an
executive
secretary
who
tries
incessantly
to
cadge
space
in
the
newspapers
their
agents
penetrate
to
the
remotest
hamlets
in
the
land
and
their
circulars
pamphlets
and
other
fulminations
swamp
the
mails
in
washington
and
at
every
state
capital
they
have
their
lobbyists
and
every
american
legislator
is
driven
half
frantic
by
their
innumerable
and
preposterous
demands
each
of
them
wants
a
law
passed
to
make
its
crusade
official
and
compulsory
each
is
forever
hunting
for
with
money
one
of
the
latest
of
these
uplifting
vereins
to
score
a
is
the
one
that
sponsored
the
maternity
bill
that
measure
is
now
a
law
and
the
american
taxpayer
at
a
cost
of
a
year
is
supporting
yet
one
more
posse
of
perambulating
gabblers
and
snouters
the
influences
behind
the
bill
were
exposed
in
the
senate
by
senator
reed
of
missouri
but
to
no
effect
a
majority
of
the
other
senators
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
propagandists
in
charge
of
it
had
already
promised
to
vote
for
it
its
one
intelligible
aim
as
senator
reed
showed
is
to
give
government
jobs
at
good
salaries
to
a
gang
of
nosey
old
maids
these
virgins
now
traverse
the
country
teaching
married
women
how
to
have
babies
in
a
and
graceful
manner
and
how
to
keep
them
alive
after
having
them
only
one
member
of
the
corps
has
ever
been
married
herself
nevertheless
the
old
gals
are
authorized
to
go
out
among
the
italian
and
yiddish
women
each
with
ten
or
twelve
head
of
kids
to
her
credit
and
tell
them
all
about
it
according
to
senator
reed
the
ultimate
aim
of
the
who
sponsored
the
scheme
is
to
provide
for
the
official
registration
of
expectant
mothers
that
they
may
be
warned
what
to
eat
what
movies
to
see
and
what
midwives
to
send
for
when
the
time
comes
imagine
a
young
bride
going
down
to
the
county
clerk
office
to
report
herself
and
imagine
an
elderly
and
anthropophagous
spinster
coming
around
next
day
to
advise
her
or
a
boozy
political
doctor
all
these
crazes
of
course
are
primarily
artificial
they
are
set
going
not
by
the
plain
people
spontaneously
nor
even
by
the
who
eventually
support
them
but
by
professionals
the
league
is
their
archetype
it
is
owned
and
operated
by
gentlemen
who
make
excellent
livings
stirring
up
the
if
their
salaries
were
cut
off
all
their
moral
passion
would
ooze
out
and
prohibition
would
be
dead
in
two
weeks
so
with
the
rest
of
the
uplifting
camorras
their
present
enormous
prosperity
i
believe
is
due
in
large
part
to
a
fact
that
is
never
thought
of
to
wit
the
fact
that
the
women
colleges
of
the
country
for
a
dozen
years
past
have
been
turning
out
far
more
graduates
than
could
be
utilized
as
teachers
these
supernumerary
lady
almost
unanimously
turn
to
the
uplift
and
the
uplift
saves
them
in
the
early
days
of
higher
education
for
women
in
the
united
states
practically
all
the
graduates
thrown
upon
the
world
got
jobs
as
teachers
but
now
a
good
many
are
left
over
moreover
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
uplift
is
easier
than
teaching
and
that
it
pays
a
great
deal
better
it
is
a
rare
woman
professor
who
gets
more
than
a
year
but
there
are
plenty
of
uplifting
jobs
at
and
a
year
and
in
the
future
there
will
be
some
prizes
at
twice
as
much
no
wonder
the
learned
girls
fall
upon
them
so
eagerly
the
annual
production
of
male
is
also
far
beyond
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
nation
but
here
the
congestion
is
relieved
by
the
greater
and
more
varied
demand
for
masculine
labor
if
a
young
man
emerging
from
columbia
or
ohio
wesleyan
as
finds
it
impossible
to
get
a
job
teaching
he

becomes
a

a

preposterous

compound

principles

formulæ
are
worked
out
for
every
emergency
there
is
no
so
idiotic
that
some
superintendent
of
schools
will
not
swallow
it
a
couple
of
days
spent
examining
the
literature
of
the
new
thought
in
pedagogy
are
enough
to
make
the
judicious
weep
its
aim
seems
to
be
to
reduce
the
whole
teaching
process
to
a
sort
of
automatic
reaction
to
discover
some
master
formula
that
will
not
only
take
the
place
of
competence
and
resourcefulness
in
the
teacher
but
that
will
also
create
an
artificial
receptivity
in
the
child
the
merciless
application
of
this
formula
which
changes
every
four
days
now
seems
to
be
the
chief
end
and
aim
of
pedagogy
teaching
becomes
a
thing
in
itself
separable
from
and
superior
to
the
thing
taught
its
mastery
is
a
special
business
a
transcendental
art
and
mystery
to
be
acquired
in
the
laboratory
a
teacher
well
grounded
in
this
mystery
and
hence
privy
to
every
detail
of
the
new
technic
which
changes
of
course
with
the
formula
can
teach
anything
to
any
child
just
as
a
sound
dentist
can
pull
any
tooth
out
of
any
jaw
all
this
i
need
not
point
out
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
old
theory
of
teaching
by
that
theory
mere
technic
was
simplified
and
subordinated
all
that
it
demanded
of
the
teacher
told
off
to
teach
say
geography
was
that
he
master
the
facts
in
the
geography
book
and
provide
himself
with
a
stout
rattan
thus
equipped
he
was
ready
for
a
test
of
his
natural
pedagogical
genius
first
he
exposed
the
facts
in
the
book
then
he
gilded
them
with
whatever
appearance
of
interest
and
importance
he
could
conjure
up
and
then
he
tested
the
extent
of
their
transference
to
the
minds
of
his
pupils
those
pupils
who
had
ingested
them
got
apples
those
who
had
failed
got
fanned
with
the
rattan
followed
the
second
round
and
the
same
test
again
with
a
second
noting
of
results
and
then
the
third
and
fourth
and
the
fifth
and
so
on
until
the
last
and
least
pupil
had
been
stuffed
to
his
subnormal
and
perhaps
moronic
brim
i
was
myself
grounded
in
the
underlying
delusions
of
what
is
called
knowledge
by
this
austere
process
and
despite
the
eloquence
of
those
who
support
newer
ideas
i
lean
heavily
in
favor
of
it
and
regret
to
hear
that
it
is
no
more
it
was
crude
it
was
rough
and
it
was
often
not
a
little
cruel
but
it
at
least
had
two
capital
advantages
over
all
the
systems
that
have
succeeded
it
in
the
first
place
its
machinery
was
simple
even
the
stupidest
child
could
understand
it
it
hooked
up
cause
and
effect
with
the
utmost
clarity
and
in
the
second
place
it
tested
the
teacher
as
and
how
he
ought
to
be
tested
that
is
for
his
actual
capacity
to
teach
not
for
his
mere
technical
virtuosity
there
was
in
fact
no
technic
for
him
to
master
and
hence
none
for
him
to
hide
behind
he
could
not
conceal
a
hopeless
inability
to
impart
knowledge
beneath
a
correct
professional
method
that
ability
to
impart
knowledge
it
seems
to
me
has
very
little
to
do
with
technical
method
it
may
operate
at
full
function
without
any
technical
method
at
all
and
contrariwise
the
most
elaborate
of
technical
methods
whether
out
of
switzerland
italy
or
gary
can
not
make
it
operate
when
it
is
not
actually
present
and
what
does
it
consist
of
it
consists
first
of
a
natural
talent
for
dealing
with
children
for
getting
into
their
minds
for
putting
things
in
a
way
that
they
can
comprehend
and
it
consists
secondly
of
a
deep
belief
in
the
interest
and
importance
of
the
thing
taught
a
concern
about
it
amounting
to
a
sort
of
passion
a
man
who
knows
a
subject
thoroughly
a
man
so
soaked
in
it
that
he
eats
it
sleeps
it
and
dreams
it
this
man
can
always
teach
it
with
success
no
matter
how
little
he
knows
of
technical
pedagogy
that
is
because
there
is
enthusiasm
in
him
and
because
enthusiasm
is
almost
as
contagious
as
fear
or
the
barber
itch
an
enthusiast
is
willing
to
go
to
any
trouble
to
impart
the
glad
news
bubbling
within
him
he
thinks
that
it
is
important
and
valuable
for
to
know
given
the
slightest
glow
of
interest
in
a
pupil
to
start
with
he
will
fan
that
glow
to
a
flame
no
hollow
formalism
cripples
him
and
slows
him
down
he
drags
his
best
pupils
along
as
fast
as
they
can
go
and
he
is
so
full
of
the
thing
that
he
never
tires
of
expounding
its
elements
to
the
dullest
this
passion
so
unordered
and
yet
so
potent
explains
the
capacity
for
teaching
that
one
frequently
observes
in
scientific
men
of
high
attainments
in
their
specialties
for
example
huxley
ostwald
karl
ludwig
virchow
billroth
jowett
william
sumner
halsted
and
osier
men
who
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
science
of
pedagogy
and
would
have
derided
its
alleged
principles
if
they
had
heard
them
stated
it
explains
too
the
failure
of
the
general
run
of
and
college
teachers
men
who
are
undoubtedly
competent
by
the
professional
standards
of
pedagogy
but
who
nevertheless
contrive
only
to
make
intolerable
bores
of
the
things
they
presume
to
teach
no
intelligent
student
ever
learns
much
from
the
average
drover
of
undergraduates
what
he
actually
carries
away
has
come
out
of
his
textbooks
or
is
the
fruit
of
his
own
reading
and
inquiry
but
when
he
passes
to
the
graduate
school
and
comes
among
men
who
really
understand
the
subjects
they
teach
and
what
is
more
who
really
love
them
his
store
of
knowledge
increases
rapidly
and
in
a
very
short
while
if
he
has
any
intelligence
at
all
he
learns
to
think
in
terms
of
the
thing
he
is
studying
so
far
so
good
but
an
objection
still
remains
the
which
may
be
couched
in
the
following
terms
that
in
the
average
college
or
high
school
and
especially
in
the
elementary
school
most
of
the
subjects
taught
are
so
bald
and
uninspiring
that
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
them
arousing
the
passion
i
have
been
describing
in
brief
that
only
an
ass
could
be
enthusiastic
about
them
in
witness
think
of
the
four
elementals
reading
penmanship
arithmetic
and
spelling
this
objection
at
first
blush
seems
salient
and
dismaying
but
only
a
brief
inspection
is
needed
to
show
that
it
is
really
of
very
small
validity
it
is
made
up
of
a
false
assumption
and
a
false
inference
the
false
inference
is
that
there
is
any
sound
reason
for
prohibiting
teaching
by
asses
if
only
the
asses
know
how
to
do
it
and
do
it
well
the
false
assumption
is
that
there
are
no
asses
in
our
schools
and
colleges
the
facts
stand
in
almost
complete
antithesis
to
these
notions
the
truth
is
that
the
average
schoolmaster
on
all
the
lower
levels
is
and
always
must
be
essentially
an
ass
for
how
can
one
imagine
an
intelligent
man
engaging
in
so
puerile
an
avocation
and
the
truth
is
that
it
is
precisely
his
inherent
asininity
and
not
his
technical
equipment
as
a
pedagogue
that
is
responsible
for
whatever
modest
success
he
now
shows
i
here
attempt
no
heavy
jocosity
but
mean
exactly
what
i
say
consider
for
example
penmanship
a
decent
handwriting
it
must
be
obvious
is
useful
to
all
men
and
particularly
to
the
lower
orders
of
men
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
capable
of
acquirement
in
school
that
actually
helps
them
to
make
a
living
well
how
is
it
taught
it
is
taught
in
the
main
by
schoolmarms
so
enmeshed
in
a
complex
and
unintelligible
technic
that
even
supposing
them
able
to
write
clearly
themselves
they
find
it
quite
impossible
to
teach
their
pupils
every
few
years
sees
a
radical
overhauling
of
the
whole
business
first
the
vertical
hand
is
to
make
it
easy
then
certain
curves
are
the
favorite
magic
then
there
is
a
return
to
slants
and
shadings
no
department
of
pedagogy
sees
a
more
hideous
cavorting
of
quacks
in
none
is
the
natural
talent
and
enthusiasm
of
the
teacher
more
depressingly
crippled
and
the
result
the
result
is
that
our
american
school
children
write
abominably
that
a
clerk
or
stenographer
with
a
simple
legible
hand
becomes
almost
as
scarce
as
one
with
greek
go
back
now
to
the
old
days
penmanship
was
then
taught
not
mechanically
and
ineffectively
by
unsound
and
shifting
formulæ
but
by
passionate
penmen
with
curly
hair
and
eyes
in
brief
by
the
unforgettable
professors
of
our
youth
with
their
flourishes
their
heavy
and
their
lovely
you
remember
them
of
course
asses
all
preposterous
popinjays
and
numskulls
pathetic
idiots
but
they
loved
penmanship
they
believed
in
the
glory
and
beauty
of
penmanship
they
were
fanatics
devotees
almost
martyrs
of
penmanship
and
so
they
got
some
touch
of
that
passion
into
their
pupils
not
enough
perhaps
to
make
more
flourishers
and
but
enough
to
make
sound
penmen
look
at
your
old
writing
book
observe
the
excellent
legibility
the
clear
strokes
of
your
time
is
money
then
look
at
your
child
such
idiots
despite
the
rise
of
scientific
pedagogy
have
not
died
out
in
the
world
i
believe
that
our
schools
are
full
of
them
both
in
pantaloons
and
in
skirts
there
are
fanatics
who
love
and
venerate
spelling
as
a
loves
and
venerates
catnip
there
are
grammatomaniacs
schoolmarms
who
would
rather
parse
than
eat
specialists
in
an
objective
case
that
does
exist
in
english
strange
beings
otherwise
sane
and
even
intelligent
and
comely
who
suffer
under
a
split
infinitive
as
you
or
i
would
suffer
under
there
are
geography
cranks
able
to
bound
mesopotamia
and
beluchistan
there
are
zealots
for
long
division
experts
in
the
multiplication
table
lunatic
worshipers
of
the
binomial
theorem
but
the
system
has
them
in
its
grip
it
combats
their
natural
enthusiasm
diligently
and
mercilessly
it
tries
to
convert
them
into
mere
technicians
clumsy
machines
it
orders
them
to
teach
not
by
the
process
of
emotional
osmosis
which
worked
in
the
days
gone
by
but
by
formulæ
that
are
as
baffling
to
the
pupil
as
they
are
paralyzing
to
the
teacher
imagine
what
would
happen
to
one
of
them
who
stepped
to
the
blackboard
seized
a
piece
of
chalk
and
engrossed
a
bird
that
held
the
class
a
bird
with
a
thousand
flowing
feathers
wings
bursting
with
parabolas
and
epicycloids
and
long
ribbons
streaming
from
its
bill
imagine
the
fate
of
one
who
began
honesty
is
the
best
policy
with
an
h
as
florid
and
to
a
child
as
beautiful
as
the
initial
of
a
mediæval
manuscript
such
a
teacher
would
be
cashiered
and
handed
over
to
the
secular
arm
the
very
enchantment
of
the
assembled
infantry
would
be
held
as
damning
proof
against
him
and
yet
it
is
just
such
teachers
that
we
should
try
to
discover
and
develop
pedagogy
needs
their
enthusiasm
their
naïve
belief
in
their
own
grotesque
talents
their
capacity
for
communicating
their
childish
passion
to
the
childish
but
this
would
mean
exposing
the
children
of
the
republic
to
contact
with
monomaniacs
defectives
well
what
of
it
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
already
exposed
to
contact
with
in
their
own
homes
they
are
taught
the
word
of
god
by
on
sundays
they
will
grow
up
into
knights
of
pythias
odd
fellows
red
men
and
other
such
in
the
days
to
come
moreover
as
i
have
hinted
they
are
already
face
to
face
with
in
the
actual
schools
at
least
in
three
cases
out
of
four
the
problem
before
us
is
not
to
dispose
of
this
fact
but
to
utilize
it
we
can
not
hope
to
fill
the
schools
with
persons
of
high
intelligence
for
persons
of
high
intelligence
simply
refuse
to
spend
their
lives
teaching
such
banal
things
as
spelling
and
arithmetic
among
the
teachers
male
we
may
safely
assume
that
per
cent
are
of
low
mentality
else
they
would
depart
for
more
appetizing
pastures
and
even
among
the
teachers
female
the
best
are
inevitably
weeded
out
by
marriage
and
only
the
worst
with
a
few
romantic
exceptions
survive
the
task
before
us
as
i
say
is
not
to
make
a
vain
denial
of
this
cerebral
inferiority
of
the
pedagogue
nor
to
try
to
combat
and
disguise
it
by
concocting
a
mass
of
technical
but
to
search
out
and
put
to
use
the
value
lying
concealed
in
it
for
even
stupidity
it
must
be
plain
has
its
uses
in
the
world
and
some
of
them
are
uses
that
intelligence
can
not
meet
one
would
not
tell
off
a
galileo
or
a
pasteur
to
drive
an
or
an
ignatius
loyola
to
be
a
stockbroker
or
a
brahms
to
lead
the
orchestra
in
a
broadway
cabaret
by
the
same
token
one
would
not
ask
a
herbert
spencer
or
a
duns
scotus
to
instruct
sucklings
such
men
would
not
only
be
wasted
at
the
job
they
would
also
be
incompetent
the
business
of
dealing
with
children
in
fact
demands
a
certain
childishness
of
mind
the
best
teacher
until
one
comes
to
adult
pupils
is
not
the
one
who
knows
most
but
the
one
who
is
most
capable
of
reducing
knowledge
to
that
simple
compound
of
the
obvious
and
the
wonderful
which
slips
easiest
into
the
infantile
comprehension
a
man
of
high
intelligence
perhaps
may
accomplish
the
thing
by
a
conscious
intellectual
feat
but
it
is
vastly
easier
to
the
man
or
woman
whose
habits
of
mind
are
naturally
on
the
plane
of
a
child
the
best
teacher
of
children
in
brief
is
one
who
is
essentially
i
go
so
far
with
this
notion
that
i
view
the
movement
to
introduce
female
bachelors
of
arts
into
the
primary
schools
with
the
utmost
alarm
a
knowledge
of
bergsonism
the
greek
aorist
sex
hygiene
and
the
dramas
of
percy
mackaye
is
not
only
no
help
to
the
teaching
of
spelling
it
is
a
positive
handicap
to
the
teaching
of
spelling
for
it
corrupts
and
blows
up
that
naïve
belief
in
the
glory
and
portentousness
of
spelling
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
successful
teaching
of
it
if
i
had
my
way
indeed
i
should
expose
all
candidates
for
berths
in
the
infant
grades
to
the
test
and
reject
all
those
who
revealed
the
mentality
of
more
than
fifteen
years
plenty
would
still
pass
moreover
they
would
be
secure
against
contamination
by
the
new
technic
of
pedagogy
its
vast
wave
of
would
curl
and
break
against
the
hard
barrier
of
their
innocent
and
passionate
intellects
as
it
probably
does
in
fact
even
now
they
would
know
nothing
of
cognition
perception
attention
the
and
all
the
other
fowl
of
the
pedagogic
aviary
but
they
would
see
in
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
the
gaudy
charms
of
profound
and
esoteric
knowledge
and
they
would
teach
these
ancient
branches
now
so
abominably
in
decay
with
passionate
gusto
and
irresistible
effectiveness
and
a
gigantic
success
ii
two
great
follies
corrupt
the
present
pedagogy
once
it
gets
beyond
the
elementals
one
is
the
folly
of
overestimating
the
receptivity
of
the
pupil
the
other
is
the
folly
of
overestimating
the
possible
efficiency
of
the
teacher
both
rest
upon
that
tendency
to
put
too
high
a
value
upon
mere
schooling
which
characterizes
democratic
and
upstart
societies
a
tendency
born
of
the
theory
that
a
young
man
who
has
been
educated
who
has
gone
through
college
is
in
some
subtle
way
more
capable
of
making
money
than
one
who
has
the
nature
of
the
schooling
on
tap
in
colleges
is
but
defectively
grasped
by
the
adherents
of
the
theory
they
view
it
i
believe
as
a
sort
of
extension
of
the
schooling
offered
in
elementary
schools
that
is
as
an
indefinite
multiplication
of
training
in
such
obviously
valuable
and
necessary
arts
as
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
it
is
of
course
nothing
of
the
sort
if
the
pupil
as
he
climbs
the
educational
ladder
is
fortunate
enough
to
come
into
contact
with
a
few
huxleys
or
ludwigs
he
may
acquire
a
great
deal
of
extremely
sound
knowledge
and
even
learn
how
to
think
for
himself
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
he
is
debarred
by
two
things
the
limitations
of
his
congenital
capacity
and
the
limitations
of
the
teachers
he
actually
encounters
the
latter
is
usually
even
more
brilliantly
patent
than
the
former
very
few
professional
teachers
it
seems
to
me
really
know
anything
worth
knowing
even
about
the
subjects
they
essay
to
teach
if
you
doubt
it
simply
examine
their
contributions
to
existing
knowledge
several
years
ago
while
engaged
upon
my
book
the
american
language
i
had
a
good
chance
to
test
the
matter
in
one
typical
department
that
of
philology
i
found
a
truly
appalling
condition
of
affairs
i
found
that
in
the
whole
united
states
there
were
not
two
dozen
teachers
of
english
philology
in
which
class
i
also
include
the
innumerable
teachers
of
plain
grammar
who
had
ever
written
ten
lines
upon
the
subject
worth
reading
it
was
not
that
they
were
indolent
or
illiterate
in
truth
they
turned
out
to
be
enormously
diligent
but
as
i
plowed
through
pyramid
after
pyramid
of
their
doctrines
and
speculations
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
i
discovered
little
save
a
vast
laboring
of
the
obvious
with
now
and
then
a
bold
flight
into
the
nonsensical
a
few
genuinely
original
philologians
revealed
themselves
pedagogues
capable
of
observing
accurately
and
reasoning
clearly
the
rest
simply
wasted
time
and
paper
whole
sections
of
the
field
were
unexplored
and
some
of
them
appeared
to
be
even
unsuspected
the
entire
of
many
an
industrious
professor
boiled
down
scarcely
made
a
footnote
in
my
book
itself
a
very
modest
work
this
tendency
to
treat
the
superior
pedagogue
too
seriously
to
view
him
as
facto
a
learned
man
and
one
thus
capable
of
conveying
learning
to
others
is
supported
by
the
circumstance
that
he
so
views
himself
and
is
in
fact
very
pretentious
and
even
bombastic
nearly
all
discussions
of
the
educational
problem
at
least
in
the
united
states
are
carried
on
by
schoolmasters
or
for
example
college
presidents
deans
and
other
such
magnificoes
and
so
they
assume
it
to
be
axiomatic
that
such
fellows
are
genuine
bearers
of
the
enlightenment
and
hence
capable
of
transmitting
it
to
others
this
is
true
sometimes
as
i
have
said
but
certainly
not
usually
the
average
or
college
pedagogue
is
not
one
who
has
been
selected
because
of
his
uncommon
knowledge
he
is
simply
one
who
has
been
stuffed
with
formal
ideas
and
taught
to
do
a
few
conventional
intellectual
tricks
contact
with
him
far
from
being
inspiring
to
any
youth
of
alert
mentality
is
really
quite
depressing
his
point
of
view
is
commonplace
and
timorous
his
best
thought
is
no
better
than
that
of
any
other
professional
man
say
a
dentist
or
an
advertisement
writer
thus
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
him
as
if
he
were
a
socrates
an
aristotle
or
even
a
leschetizky
he
is
actually
much
more
nearly
related
to
a
barber
or
a
lieutenant
of
marines
a
worthy
man
industrious
and
respectable
but
do
expect
too
much
of
him
to
ask
him
to
struggle
out
of
his
puddle
of
safe
platitudes
and
plunge
into
the
whirlpool
of
surmise
and
speculation
that
carries
on
the
fragile
shallop
of
human
progress
to
do
this
is
as
absurd
as
to
ask
a
neighborhood
doctor
to
undertake
major
surgery
in
the
united
states
his
low
intellectual
status
is
kept
low
not
only
by
the
meager
rewards
of
his
trade
in
a
country
where
money
is
greatly
sought
and
esteemed
but
also
by
the
democratic
theory
of
education
that
is
by
the
theory
that
mere
education
can
convert
a
peasant
into
an
intellectual
aristocrat
with
all
of
the
peculiar
superiorities
of
an
aristocrat
in
brief
that
it
is
possible
to
make
purses
out
of
sow
ears
the
intellectual
collapse
of
the
american
during
the
late
war
a
collapse
so
nearly
unanimous
that
those
who
did
not
share
it
attained
to
a
sort
of
immortality
overnight
was
perhaps
largely
due
to
this
error
who
were
these
bawling
professors
so
pathetically
poltroonish
and
idiotic
in
an
enormous
number
of
cases
they
were
simply
peasants
in
oafs
from
the
farms
and
villages
of
iowa
kansas
vermont
alabama
the
dakotas
and
other
such
backward
states
horribly
stuffed
with
standardized
learning
in
some
university
and
then
set
to
teaching
to
look
for
a
civilized
attitude
of
mind
in
such
strassburg
geese
is
to
look
for
honor
in
a
valet
to
confuse
them
with
scholars
is
to
confuse
the
knights
of
pythias
with
the
knights
hospitaller
in
brief
the
trouble
with
them
was
that
they
had
no
sound
tradition
behind
them
that
they
had
not
learned
to
think
clearly
and
decently
that
they
were
not
gentlemen
the
youth
with
a
better
background
behind
him
passing
through
an
american
university
seldom
acquires
any
yearning
to
linger
as
a
teacher
the
air
is
too
thick
for
him
the
rewards
are
too
trivial
the
intrigues
are
too
and
degrading
thus
the
chairs
even
in
the
larger
universities
tend
to
be
filled
more
and
more
by
yokels
who
have
got
themselves
what
is
called
an
education
only
by
dint
of
herculean
effort
exhausted
by
the
cruel
process
they
are
old
men
at
or
and
so
hugging
their
they
sink
into
convenient
instructorships
and
end
at
as
the
social
status
of
the
american
pedagogue
helps
along
the
process
unlike
in
europe
where
he
has
a
secure
and
honorable
position
he
ranks
in
the
united
states
somewhere
between
a
methodist
preacher
and
a
prosperous
owner
certainly
clearly
below
the
latter
thus
the
youth
of
civilized
upbringings
feels
that
it
would
be
stooping
a
bit
to
take
up
the
rattan
but
the
obviously
makes
a
step
upward
and
is
hence
eager
for
the
black
gown
thereby
a
vicious
circle
is
formed
the
by
entering
the
ancient
guild
drags
it
down
still
further
and
so
makes
it
increasingly
difficult
to
snare
apprentices
from
superior
castes
a
glance
at
who
who
in
america
offers
a
good
deal
of
support
for
all
this
theorizing
there
was
a
time
when
the
typical
american
professor
came
from
a
small
area
in
new
england
for
generations
the
seat
of
a
high
literacy
and
even
of
a
certain
austere
civilization
but
he
comes
from
the
region
of
silos
revivals
and
saleratus
behind
him
there
is
absolutely
no
tradition
of
aristocratic
aloofness
and
urbanity
or
even
of
mere
civilized
decency
he
is
a
bind
by
birth
and
he
carries
the
smell
of
the
dunghill
into
the
academic
grove
and
not
only
the
smell
but
also
some
of
the
dung
itself
what
one
looks
for
in
such
men
is
dullness
superficiality
a
great
credulity
an
incapacity
for
learning
anything
save
a
few
rudiments
a
passionate
yielding
to
all
popular
crazes
a
malignant
distrust
of
genuine
superiority
a
huge
megalomania
these
are
precisely
the
things
that
one
finds
in
the
typical
american
pedagogue
of
the
new
dispensation
he
is
not
only
a
numskull
he
is
also
a
boor
in
the
university
president
he
reaches
his
heights
here
we
have
a
learned
man
who
spends
his
time
making
speeches
before
chautauquas
chambers
of
commerce
and
rotary
clubs
and
flattering
trustees
who
run
both
universities
and
and
cadging
money
from
such
men
as
rockefeller
and
carnegie
iii
the
same
educational
fallacy
which
fills
the
groves
of
learning
with
such
dunces
causes
a
huge
waste
of
energy
and
money
on
lower
levels
those
to
wit
of
the
secondary
schools
the
theory
behind
the
lavish
multiplication
of
such
schools
is
that
they
outfit
the
children
of
the
mob
with
the
materials
of
reasoning
and
inculcate
in
them
a
habit
of
indulging
in
it
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
any
evidence
in
support
of
that
theory
the
common
people
of
america
at
least
the
white
portion
of
them
are
rather
above
the
world
average
in
literacy
but
there
is
no
sign
that
they
have
acquired
thereby
any
capacity
for
weighing
facts
or
comparing
ideas
the
school
statistics
show
that
the
average
member
of
the
american
legion
can
read
and
write
after
a
fashion
and
is
able
to
multiply
eight
by
seven
after
four
trials
but
they
tell
us
nothing
about
his
actual
intelligence
the
returns
of
the
army
itself
indeed
indicate
that
he
is
stupid
almost
beyond
belief
that
there
is
at
least
an
even
chance
that
he
is
a
moron
is
such
a
fellow
appreciably
superior
to
the
villein
of
the
middle
ages
sometimes
i
am
tempted
to
doubt
it
i
suspect
for
example
that
the
belief
in
witchcraft
is
still
almost
as
widespread
among
the
plain
people
of
the
united
states
at
least
outside
the
large
cities
as
it
was
in
europe
in
the
year
in
my
own
state
of
all
of
the
negroes
and
mulattoes
believe
absolutely
in
witches
and
so
do
most
of
the
whites
the
belief
in
ghosts
penetrates
to
quite
high
levels
i
know
very
few
americans
indeed
who
reject
it
without
reservation
one
constantly
comes
upon
grave
defenses
of
spiritism
in
some
form
or
other
by
men
theoretically
of
learning
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
it
would
be
difficult
to
muster
fifty
men
willing
to
denounce
the
thing
publicly
it
would
not
only
be
politically
dangerous
for
them
to
do
so
it
would
also
go
against
their
consciences
what
is
always
forgotten
is
that
the
capacity
for
knowledge
of
the
great
masses
of
human
blanks
is
very
low
that
no
matter
how
adroitly
pedagogy
tackles
them
with
its
technical
sorceries
it
remains
a
practical
impossibility
to
teach
them
anything
beyond
reading
and
writing
and
the
most
elementary
arithmetic
worse
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
appreciable
improvement
in
their
congenitally
ignoble
tastes
and
so
they
devote
even
the
paltry
learning
that
they
acquire
to
degrading
uses
if
the
average
american
read
only
the
newspapers
as
is
frequently
alleged
it
would
be
bad
enough
but
the
truth
is
that
he
reads
only
the
most
imbecile
of
the
newspapers
of
the
matter
in
a
daily
paper
of
the
better
sort
is
almost
as
unintelligible
to
him
as
the
theory
of
least
squares
the
words
lie
outside
his
vocabulary
the
ideas
are
beyond
the
farthest
leap
of
his
intellect
it
is
indeed
a
sober
fact
that
even
an
editorial
in
the
new
york
is
probably
incomprehensible
to
all
americans
save
a
small
minority
and
not
remember
on
the
ground
that
it
is
too
nonsensical
but
on
the
ground
that
it
is
too
subtle
the
same
sort
of
mind
that
regards
rubinstein
melody
in
f
as
too
classical
to
be
agreeable
is
also
stumped
by
the
most
transparent
english
like
most
other
professional
writers
i
get
a
good
many
letters
from
my
customers
complaints
naturally
are
more
numerous
than
compliments
it
is
only
indignation
that
can
induce
the
average
man
to
brave
the
ardors
of
pen
and
ink
well
the
complaint
that
i
hear
most
often
is
that
my
english
is
unintelligible
that
it
is
too
full
of
hard
words
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
astounding
my
english
is
actually
almost
as
bald
and
simple
as
the
english
of
a
college
yell
my
sentences
are
short
and
plainly
constructed
i
resolutely
cultivate
the
most
direct
manner
of
statement
my
vocabulary
is
deliberately
composed
of
the
words
of
everyday
nevertheless
a
great
many
of
my
readers
in
my
own
country
find
reading
me
an
uncomfortably
severe
burden
upon
their
linguistic
and
intellectual
resources
these
readers
are
certainly
not
below
the
american
average
in
intelligence
on
the
contrary
they
must
be
a
good
deal
above
the
average
for
they
have
at
least
got
to
the
point
where
they
are
willing
to
put
out
of
the
safe
harbor
of
the
obvious
and
respectable
and
to
brave
the
seas
where
more
or
less
novel
ideas
rage
and
roar
think
of
what
the
ordinary
newspaper
reader
would
make
of
my
compositions
there
is
in
fact
no
need
to
think
i
have
tried
them
on
him
his
customary
response
when
by
mountebankish
devices
i
forced
him
to
read
or
at
all
events
to
try
to
read
was
to
demand
resolutely
that
the
guilty
newspaper
cease
printing
me
and
to
threaten
to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
the
slightest
i
tell
the
literal
truth
it
is
such
idiots
that
the
little
red
operates
upon
in
the
hope
of
unearthing
an
occasional
man
is
that
hope
ever
fulfilled
despite
much
testimony
to
the
effect
that
it
is
i
am
convinced
that
it
really
is
men
are
never
begotten
by
knights
of
pythias
the
notion
that
they
sometimes
are
is
due
to
an
optical
delusion
when
they
appear
in
obscure
and
ignoble
circles
it
is
no
more
than
a
proof
that
only
an
extremely
wise
sire
knows
his
own
son
adultery
in
brief
is
one
of
nature
devices
for
keeping
the
lowest
orders
of
men
from
sinking
to
the
level
of
downright
simians
sometimes
for
a
few
brief
years
in
youth
their
wives
and
daughters
are
comely
and
now
and
then
the
baron
drinks
more
than
he
ought
to
but
it
is
foolish
to
argue
that
the
gigantic
machine
of
popular
education
is
needed
to
rescue
such
hybrids
from
their
environment
the
truth
is
that
all
the
education
rammed
into
the
average
pupil
in
the
average
american
public
school
could
be
acquired
by
the
v
larva
of
any
reasonably
intelligent
man
in
no
more
than
six
weeks
of
ordinary
application
and
that
where
schools
are
unknown
it
actually
so
acquired
a
bright
child
in
fact
can
learn
to
read
and
write
without
any
save
the
most
casual
aid
a
great
deal
faster
than
it
can
learn
to
read
and
write
in
a
where
the
difficulties
of
the
stupid
retard
it
enormously
and
it
is
further
burdened
by
the
crazy
formulæ
invented
by
pedagogues
and
once
it
can
read
and
write
it
is
just
as
well
equipped
to
acquire
further
knowledge
as
of
the
teachers
it
will
subsequently
encounter
in
school
or
college
iv
i
know
a
good
many
men
of
great
learning
that
is
men
born
with
an
extraordinary
eagerness
and
capacity
to
acquire
knowledge
one
and
all
they
tell
me
that
they
ca
recall
learning
anything
of
any
value
in
school
all
that
schoolmasters
managed
to
accomplish
with
them
was
to
test
and
determine
the
amount
of
knowledge
that
they
had
already
acquired
independently
and
not
infrequently
the
determination
was
made
clumsily
and
inaccurately
in
my
own
nonage
i
had
a
great
desire
to
acquire
knowledge
in
certain
limited
directions
to
wit
those
of
the
physical
sciences
before
i
was
ever
permitted
by
the
regulations
of
the
secondary
seminary
i
was
penned
in
to
open
a
chemistry
book
i
had
learned
a
great
deal
of
chemistry
by
the
simple
process
of
reading
the
texts
and
then
going
through
the
processes
described
when
at
last
i
was
introduced
to
chemistry
officially
i
found
the
teaching
of
it
appalling
the
one
aim
of
that
teaching
in
fact
seemed
to
be
to
first
purge
me
of
what
i
already
knew
and
then
refill
me
with
the
same
stuff
in
a
formal
doltish
unintelligible
form
my
experience
with
physics
was
even
worse
i
knew
nothing
about
it
when
i
undertook
its
study
in
class
for
that
was
before
the
days
when
physics
swallowed
chemistry
well
it
was
taught
so
abominably
that
it
immediately
became
incomprehensible
to
me
and
hence
extremely
distasteful
and
to
this
day
i
know
nothing
about
it
worse
it
remains
unpleasant
to
me
and
so
i
am
shut
off
from
the
interesting
and
useful
knowledge
that
i
might
otherwise
acquire
by
reading
one
extraordinary
teacher
i
remember
who
taught
me
something
a
teacher
of
mathematics
i
had
a
dislike
for
that
science
and
knew
little
about
it
finally
my
neglect
of
it
brought
me
to
bay
in
transferring
from
one
school
to
another
i
found
that
i
was
hopelessly
short
in
algebra
what
was
needed
of
course
was
not
an
actual
knowledge
of
algebra
but
simply
the
superficial
smattering
needed
to
pass
an
examination
the
teacher
that
i
mention
observing
my
distress
generously
offered
to
fill
me
with
that
smattering
after
school
hours
he
got
the
whole
year
course
into
me
in
exactly
six
lessons
of
half
an
hour
each
and
how
more
accurately
why
simply
because
he
was
an
algebra
fanatic
because
he
believed
that
algebra
was
not
only
a
science
of
the
utmost
importance
but
also
one
of
the
greatest
fascination
he
was
the
penmanship
professor
of
years
ago
lifted
to
a
higher
level
a
likable
and
plausible
man
he
convinced
me
in
twenty
minutes
that
ignorance
of
algebra
was
as
calamitous
socially
and
intellectually
as
ignorance
of
table
manners
that
acquiring
its
elements
was
as
necessary
as
washing
behind
the
ears
so
i
fell
upon
the
book
and
gulped
it
voraciously
greatly
to
the
astonishment
of
my
father
whose
earlier
mathematical
teaching
had
failed
to
set
me
off
because
it
was
too
pressing
because
it
bombarded
me
not
when
i
was
penned
in
a
school
and
so
inclined
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
when
i
had
got
through
a
day
schooling
and
felt
inclined
to
play
to
this
day
i
comprehend
the
binomial
theorem
a
very
rare
accomplishment
in
an
author
for
many
years
indeed
i
was
probably
the
only
american
newspaper
editor
who
knew
what
it
was
two
other
teachers
of
that
school
i
remember
pleasantly
as
fellows
whose
pedagogy
profitted
me
both
it
happens
were
drunken
and
disreputable
men
one
taught
me
to
chew
tobacco
an
art
that
has
done
more
to
give
me
an
evil
name
perhaps
than
even
my
socinianism
the
other
introduced
me
to
shakespeare
congreve
wycherly
marlowe
and
sheridan
and
so
filled
me
with
that
taste
for
coarseness
which
now
offends
so
many
of
my
customers
lay
and
clerical
neither
ever
came
to
a
dignified
position
in
academic
circles
one
abandoned
pedagogy
for
the
law
became
involved
in
causes
of
a
dubious
nature
and
finally
disappeared
into
the
shades
which
engulf
attorneys
the
other
went
upon
a
fearful
drunk
one
christmastide
got
himself
shanghaied
on
the
and
is
supposed
to
have
fallen
overboard
from
a
british
tramp
bound
east
for
cardiff
at
all
events
he
has
never
been
heard
from
since
two
evil
fellows
and
yet
i
hold
their
memories
in
affection
and
believe
that
they
were
the
best
teachers
i
ever
had
for
in
both
there
was
something
a
good
deal
more
valuable
than
mere
pedagogical
skill
and
diligence
and
even
more
valuable
than
correct
demeanor
and
that
was
a
passionate
love
of
sound
literature
this
love
given
reasonably
receptive
soil
they
knew
how
to
communicate
as
a
man
can
nearly
always
communicate
whatever
moves
him
profoundly
neither
ever
made
the
slightest
effort
to
teach
literature
as
the
business
is
carried
on
by
the
usual
idiot
schoolmaster
both
had
a
vast
contempt
for
the
that
were
official
in
their
school
and
used
to
entertain
the
boys
by
pointing
out
the
nonsense
in
them
both
were
full
of
derisory
objections
to
the
principal
heroes
of
such
books
in
those
days
scott
irving
pope
jane
austen
dickens
trollope
tennyson
but
both
discoursing
in
their
disorderly
way
upon
heroes
of
their
own
were
magnificently
eloquent
and
persuasive
the
boy
who
could
listen
to
one
of
them
intoning
whitman
and
stand
unmoved
was
a
dull
fellow
indeed
the
boy
who
could
resist
the
other
enthusiasm
for
the
old
essayists
was
intellectually
deaf
dumb
and
blind
i
often
wonder
if
their
expoundings
of
their
passions
and
prejudices
would
have
been
half
so
charming
if
they
had
been
wholly
respectable
men
like
their
colleagues
of
the
school
faculty
it
is
not
likely
a
healthy
boy
is
in
constant
revolt
against
the
sort
of
men
who
surround
him
at
school
their
puerile
pedantries
their
christian
endeavor
respectability
their
sedentery
pallor
their
curious
preference
for
the
dull
and
uninteresting
their
general
air
of
so
many
secretaries
these
things
infallibly
repel
the
youth
who
is
above
milksoppery
in
every
boys
school
the
favorite
teacher
is
one
who
occasionally
swears
like
a
cavalryman
or
is
reputed
to
keep
a
jug
in
his
room
or
is
known
to
receive
a
scented
note
every
morning
boys
are
good
judges
of
men
as
girls
are
good
judges
of
women
it
is
not
by
accident
that
most
of
them
at
some
time
or
other
long
to
be
cowboys
or
drivers
and
that
none
of
them
not
obviously
diseased
in
mind
ever
longs
to
be
a
superintendent
put
that
judgment
to
a
simple
test
what
would
become
of
a
nation
in
which
all
of
the
men
were
at
heart
superintendents
or
secretaries
or
pedagogues
imagine
it
in
conflict
with
a
nation
of
cowboys
and
drivers
which
would
be
the
stronger
and
which
would
be
the
more
intelligent
resourceful
enterprising
and
courageous
xiv
types
of
men
there
is
a
variety
of
man
whose
eye
inevitably
exaggerates
whose
ear
inevitably
hears
more
than
the
band
plays
whose
invagination
inevitably
doubles
and
triples
the
news
brought
in
by
his
five
senses
he
is
the
enthusiast
the
believer
the
romantic
he
is
the
sort
of
fellow
who
if
he
were
a
bacteriologist
would
report
the
streptoccocus
pyogenes
to
be
as
large
as
a
bernard
dog
as
intelligent
as
socrates
as
beautiful
as
beauvais
cathedral
and
as
respectable
as
a
yale
professor
no
man
ever
quite
believes
in
any
other
man
one
may
believe
in
an
idea
absolutely
but
not
in
a
man
in
the
highest
confidence
there
is
always
a
flavor
of
doubt
a
feeling
half
instinctive
and
half
logical
that
after
all
the
scoundrel
have
something
up
his
sleeve
this
doubt
it
must
be
obvious
is
always
more
than
justified
for
no
man
is
worthy
of
unlimited
reliance
his
treason
at
best
only
waits
for
sufficient
temptation
the
trouble
with
the
world
is
not
that
men
are
too
suspicious
in
this
direction
but
that
they
tend
to
be
too
confiding
that
they
still
trust
themselves
too
far
to
other
men
even
after
bitter
experience
women
i
believe
are
measurably
less
sentimental
in
this
as
in
other
things
no
married
woman
ever
trusts
her
husband
absolutely
nor
does
she
ever
act
as
if
she
trust
him
her
utmost
confidence
is
as
wary
as
an
american
confidence
that
the
policeman
on
the
beat
will
stay
bought
faith
may
be
defined
briefly
as
an
illogical
belief
in
the
occurrence
of
the
improbable
or
psychoanalytically
as
a
wish
neurose
there
is
thus
a
flavor
of
the
pathological
in
it
it
goes
beyond
the
normal
intellectual
process
and
passes
into
the
murky
domain
of
transcendental
metaphysics
a
man
full
of
faith
is
simply
one
who
has
lost
or
never
had
the
capacity
for
clear
and
realistic
thought
he
is
not
a
mere
ass
he
is
actually
ill
worse
he
is
incurable
for
disappointment
being
essentially
an
objective
phenomenon
can
not
permanently
affect
his
subjective
infirmity
his
faith
takes
on
the
virulence
of
a
chronic
infection
what
he
usually
says
in
substance
is
this
let
us
trust
in
god
has
always
fooled
us
in
the
past
all
democratic
theories
whether
socialistic
or
bourgeois
necessarily
take
in
some
concept
of
the
dignity
of
labor
if
the
were
deprived
of
this
delusion
that
his
sufferings
in
the
are
somehow
laudable
and
agreeable
to
god
there
would
be
little
left
in
his
ego
save
a
nevertheless
a
delusion
is
a
delusion
and
this
is
one
of
the
worst
it
arises
out
of
confusing
the
pride
of
workmanship
of
the
artist
with
the
dogged
painful
docility
of
the
machine
the
difference
is
important
and
enormous
if
he
got
no
reward
whatever
the
artist
would
go
on
working
just
the
same
his
actual
reward
in
fact
is
often
so
little
that
he
almost
starves
but
suppose
a
got
nothing
for
his
labor
would
he
go
on
working
just
the
same
can
one
imagine
him
submitting
voluntarily
to
hardship
and
sore
want
that
he
might
express
his
soul
in
more
pairs
of
pantaloons
hygiene
is
the
corruption
of
medicine
by
morality
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
hygienist
who
does
not
debase
his
theory
of
the
healthful
with
a
theory
of
the
virtuous
the
whole
hygienic
art
indeed
resolves
itself
into
an
ethical
exhortation
and
in
the
of
sex
into
a
puerile
and
belated
advocacy
of
asceticism
this
brings
it
at
the
end
into
diametrical
conflict
with
medicine
proper
the
aim
of
medicine
is
surely
not
to
make
men
virtuous
it
is
to
safeguard
and
rescue
them
from
the
consequences
of
their
vices
the
true
physician
does
not
preach
repentance
he
offers
absolution
the
value
the
world
sets
upon
motives
is
often
grossly
unjust
and
inaccurate
consider
for
example
two
of
them
mere
insatiable
curiosity
and
the
desire
to
do
good
the
latter
is
put
high
above
the
former
and
yet
it
is
the
former
that
moves
some
of
the
greatest
men
the
human
race
has
yet
produced
the
scientific
investigators
what
animates
a
great
pathologist
is
it
the
desire
to
cure
disease
to
save
life
surely
not
save
perhaps
as
an
afterthought
he
is
too
intelligent
deep
down
in
his
soul
to
see
anything
praiseworthy
in
such
a
desire
he
knows
by
observation
that
his
discoveries
will
do
quite
as
much
harm
as
good
that
a
thousand
scoundrels
will
profit
to
every
honest
man
that
the
folks
who
most
deserve
to
be
saved
will
probably
be
the
last
to
be
saved
no
man
of
could
devote
himself
to
pathology
on
such
terms
what
actually
moves
him
is
his
unquenchable
curiosity
his
boundless
almost
pathological
thirst
to
penetrate
the
unknown
to
uncover
the
secret
to
find
out
what
has
not
been
found
out
before
his
prototype
is
not
the
liberator
releasing
slaves
the
good
samaritan
lifting
up
the
fallen
but
the
dog
sniffing
tremendously
at
an
infinite
series
of
and
yet
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
of
men
and
yet
he
stands
in
the
very
front
rank
of
the
race
business
it
is
after
all
a
sound
instinct
which
puts
business
below
the
professions
and
burdens
the
business
man
with
a
social
inferiority
that
he
can
never
quite
shake
off
even
in
america
the
business
man
in
fact
acquiesces
in
this
assumption
of
his
inferiority
even
when
he
protests
against
it
he
is
the
only
man
who
is
forever
apologizing
for
his
occupation
he
is
the
only
one
who
always
seeks
to
make
it
appear
when
he
attains
the
object
of
his
labors
the
making
of
a
great
deal
of
money
that
it
was
not
the
object
of
his
labors
perhaps
the
most
valuable
asset
that
any
man
can
have
in
this
world
is
a
naturally
superior
air
a
talent
for
sniffishness
and
reserve
the
generality
of
men
are
always
greatly
impressed
by
it
and
accept
it
freely
as
a
proof
of
genuine
merit
one
need
but
disdain
them
to
gain
their
respect
their
congenital
stupidity
and
timorousness
make
them
turn
to
any
leader
who
offers
and
the
sign
of
leadership
that
they
recognize
most
readily
is
that
which
shows
itself
in
external
manner
this
is
the
true
explanation
of
the
survival
of
monarchism
which
invariably
lives
through
its
perennial
deaths
it
is
the
popular
theory
at
least
in
america
that
monarchism
is
a
curse
fastened
upon
the
common
people
from
above
that
the
monarch
saddles
it
upon
them
without
their
consent
and
against
their
will
the
theory
is
without
support
in
the
facts
kings
are
created
not
by
kings
but
by
the
people
they
visualize
one
of
the
ineradicable
needs
of
all
men
which
means
of
nine
men
out
of
ten
and
that
is
the
need
of
something
to
venerate
to
bow
down
to
to
follow
and
obey
the
king
business
begins
to
grow
precarious
not
when
kings
reach
out
for
greater
powers
but
when
they
begin
to
resign
and
renounce
their
powers
the
czars
of
russia
were
quite
secure
upon
the
throne
so
long
as
they
ran
russia
like
a
reformatory
but
the
moment
they
began
to
yield
to
liberal
ideas
by
emancipating
the
serfs
and
setting
up
constitutionalism
their
doom
was
sounded
the
people
saw
this
yielding
as
a
sign
of
weakness
they
began
to
suspect
that
the
czars
after
all
were
not
actually
superior
to
other
men
and
so
they
turned
to
other
and
antagonistic
leaders
all
as
cocksure
as
the
czars
had
once
been
and
in
the
course
of
time
they
were
stimulated
to
rebellion
these
leaders
or
at
all
events
the
two
or
three
most
resolute
and
daring
of
them
then
undertook
to
run
the
country
in
the
precise
way
that
it
had
been
run
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
monarchy
that
is
to
say
they
seized
and
exerted
irresistible
power
and
laid
claim
to
infallible
wisdom
history
will
date
their
downfall
from
the
day
they
began
to
ease
their
pretensions
once
they
confessed
even
by
implication
that
they
were
merely
human
the
common
people
began
to
turn
against
them
average
it
is
often
urged
against
the
scientific
socialists
with
their
materialistic
conception
of
history
that
they
overlook
certain
spiritual
qualities
that
are
independent
of
wage
scales
and
metabolism
these
qualities
it
is
argued
color
the
aspirations
and
activities
of
civilized
man
quite
as
much
as
they
are
colored
by
his
material
condition
and
so
make
it
impossible
to
consider
him
simply
as
an
economic
machine
as
examples
the
cite
patriotism
pity
the
æsthetic
sense
and
the
yearning
to
know
god
unluckily
the
examples
are
millions
of
men
are
quite
devoid
of
patriotism
pity
and
the
æsthetic
sense
and
have
no
very
active
desire
to
know
god
why
do
the
cite
a
spiritual
quality
that
is
genuinely
universal
there
is
one
readily
to
hand
i
allude
to
cowardice
it
is
in
one
form
or
other
visible
in
every
human
being
it
almost
serves
to
mark
off
the
human
race
from
all
the
other
higher
animals
cowardice
i
believe
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
caste
system
the
foundation
of
every
organized
society
including
the
most
democratic
in
order
to
escape
going
to
war
himself
the
peasant
was
willing
to
give
the
warrior
certain
privileges
and
out
of
those
privileges
has
grown
the
whole
structure
of
civilization
go
back
still
further
property
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
a
few
relatively
courageous
men
were
able
to
accumulate
more
possessions
than
whole
hordes
of
cowardly
men
and
what
is
more
to
retain
them
after
accumulating
them
the
man
who
boasts
that
he
habitually
tells
the
truth
is
simply
a
man
with
no
respect
for
it
it
is
not
a
thing
to
be
thrown
about
loosely
like
small
change
it
is
something
to
be
cherished
and
hoarded
and
disbursed
only
when
absolutely
necessary
the
smallest
atom
of
truth
represents
some
man
bitter
toil
and
agony
for
every
ponderable
chunk
of
it
there
is
a
brave
grave
upon
some
lonely
and
a
soul
roasting
in
hell
nietzsche
in
altering
schopenhauer
to
probably
fell
into
a
capital
error
the
truth
is
that
the
thing
the
average
man
seeks
in
life
is
not
primarily
power
but
peace
all
his
struggle
is
toward
a
state
of
tranquillity
and
equilibrium
what
he
always
dreams
of
is
a
state
in
which
he
will
have
to
do
battle
no
longer
this
dream
plainly
enters
into
his
conception
of
heaven
he
thinks
of
himself
mortem
browsing
about
the
celestial
meadows
like
a
cow
in
a
safe
pasture
a
few
extraordinary
men
enjoy
combat
at
all
times
and
all
men
are
inclined
toward
it
at
orgiastic
moments
but
the
race
as
a
race
craves
peace
and
man
belongs
among
the
more
timorous
docile
and
unimaginative
animals
along
with
the
deer
the
horse
and
the
sheep
this
craving
for
peace
is
vividly
displayed
in
the
conflict
of
the
sexes
every
normal
woman
wants
to
be
married
for
the
plain
reason
that
marriage
offers
her
security
and
every
normal
man
avoids
marriage
as
long
as
possible
for
the
equally
plain
reason
that
marriage
invades
and
threatens
security
the
normal
man
antipathy
to
his
relatives
particularly
of
the
second
degree
is
explained
by
psychologists
in
various
tortured
and
improbable
ways
the
true
explanation
i
venture
is
a
good
deal
simpler
it
lies
in
the
plain
fact
that
every
man
sees
in
his
relatives
and
especially
in
his
cousins
a
series
of
grotesque
caricatures
of
himself
they
exhibit
his
qualities
in
disconcerting
augmentation
or
diminution
they
fill
him
with
a
disquieting
feeling
that
this
perhaps
is
the
way
he
appears
to
the
world
and
so
they
wound
his
and
give
him
intense
discomfort
to
admire
his
relatives
a
man
must
be
lacking
in
the
finer
sort
of
one
of
the
most
mawkish
of
human
delusions
is
the
notion
that
friendship
should
be
eternal
or
at
all
events
and
that
any
act
which
puts
a
term
to
it
is
somehow
discreditable
the
fact
is
that
a
man
of
active
and
resilient
mind
outwears
his
friendships
just
as
certainly
as
he
outwears
his
love
affairs
his
politics
and
his
epistemology
they
become
threadbare
shabby
irritating
depressing
they
convert
themselves
from
living
realities
into
moribund
artificialities
and
stand
in
sinister
opposition
to
freedom
and
truth
it
is
as
corrupting
to
preserve
them
after
they
have
grown
and
hollow
as
it
is
to
keep
up
the
forms
of
passion
after
passion
itself
is
a
corpse
every
act
and
attitude
that
they
involve
thus
becomes
an
act
of
hypocrisy
an
attitude
of
dishonesty
a
prudent
man
remembering
that
life
is
short
gives
an
hour
or
two
now
and
then
to
a
critical
examination
of
his
friendships
he
weighs
them
edits
them
tests
the
metal
of
them
a
few
he
retains
perhaps
with
radical
changes
in
their
terms
but
the
majority
he
expunges
from
his
minutes
and
tries
to
forget
as
he
tries
to
forget
the
cold
and
clammy
loves
of
year
before
last
xv
the
dismal
science
every
man
as
the
psalmist
says
to
his
own
poison
or
poisons
as
the
case
may
be
one
of
mine
following
hard
after
theology
is
political
economy
what
political
economy
that
dismal
science
well
why
not
its
dismalness
is
largely
a
delusion
due
to
the
fact
that
its
chief
ornaments
at
least
in
our
own
day
are
university
professors
the
professor
must
be
an
obscurantist
or
he
is
nothing
he
has
a
special
and
unmatchable
talent
for
dullness
his
central
aim
is
not
to
expose
the
truth
clearly
but
to
exhibit
his
profundity
his
esotericity
in
brief
to
stagger
sophomores
and
other
professors
the
notion
that
german
is
a
gnarled
and
unintelligible
language
arises
out
of
the
circumstance
that
it
is
so
much
written
by
professors
it
took
a
rebel
member
of
the
clan
swinging
to
the
antipodes
in
his
unearthly
treason
to
prove
its
explicitness
its
resiliency
it
downright
beauty
but
nietzsches
are
few
and
so
german
remains
soggy
and
political
economy
continues
to
be
swathed
in
dullness
as
i
say
however
that
dullness
is
only
superficial
there
is
no
more
engrossing
book
in
the
english
language
than
adam
smith
the
wealth
of
nations
surely
the
eighteenth
century
produced
nothing
that
can
be
read
with
greater
ease
nor
is
there
any
inherent
reason
why
even
the
most
technical
divisions
of
its
subject
should
have
gathered
cobwebs
with
the
passing
of
the
years
taxation
for
example
is
eternally
lively
it
concerns
ninetenths
of
us
more
directly
than
either
smallpox
or
golf
and
has
just
as
much
drama
in
it
moreover
it
has
been
mellowed
and
made
gay
by
as
many
gaudy
preposterous
theories
as
for
foreign
exchange
it
is
almost
as
romantic
as
young
love
and
quite
as
resistent
to
formulæ
do
the
professors
make
an
autopsy
of
it
then
read
the
occasional
treatises
of
some
professor
of
it
who
is
not
a
professor
say
garet
garrett
or
john
moody
unluckily
garretts
and
moodys
are
almost
as
rare
as
nietzsches
and
so
the
amateur
of
such
things
must
be
content
to
wrestle
with
the
professors
seeking
the
violet
of
human
interest
beneath
the
avalanche
of
their
graceless
parts
of
speech
a
hard
business
i
daresay
to
one
not
practiced
and
to
its
hardness
there
is
added
the
disquiet
of
a
doubt
that
doubt
does
not
concern
itself
with
the
doctrine
preached
at
least
not
directly
there
may
be
in
it
nothing
intrinsically
dubious
on
the
contrary
it
may
appear
as
sound
as
the
binomial
theorem
as
well
supported
as
the
dogma
of
infant
damnation
but
all
the
time
a
troubling
question
keeps
afloat
in
the
air
and
that
is
briefly
this
what
would
happen
to
the
learned
professors
if
they
took
the
other
side
in
other
words
to
what
extent
is
political
economy
as
professors
expound
and
practice
it
a
free
science
in
the
sense
that
mathematics
and
physiology
are
free
sciences
at
what
place
if
any
is
speculation
pulled
up
by
a
rule
that
beyond
lies
treason
anarchy
and
disaster
these
questions
i
hope
i
need
not
add
are
not
inspired
by
any
heterodoxy
in
my
own
black
heart
i
am
in
many
fields
a
flouter
of
the
accepted
revelation
and
hence
immoral
but
the
field
of
economics
is
not
one
of
them
here
indeed
i
know
of
no
man
who
is
more
orthodox
than
i
am
i
believe
that
the
present
organization
of
society
as
bad
as
it
is
is
better
than
any
other
that
has
ever
been
proposed
i
reject
all
the
sure
cures
in
current
agitation
from
government
ownership
to
the
single
tax
i
am
in
favor
of
free
competition
in
all
human
enterprises
and
to
the
utmost
limit
i
admire
successful
scoundrels
and
shrink
from
socialists
as
i
shrink
from
methodists
but
all
the
same
the
aforesaid
doubt
pursues
me
when
i
plow
through
the
solemn
disproofs
and
expositions
of
the
learned
professors
of
economics
and
that
doubt
will
not
down
it
is
not
logical
or
evidential
but
purely
psychological
and
what
it
is
grounded
on
is
an
unshakable
belief
that
no
man
opinion
is
worth
a
hoot
however
well
supported
and
maintained
so
long
as
he
is
not
absolutely
free
if
the
spirit
moves
him
to
support
and
maintain
the
exactly
contrary
opinion
in
brief
human
reason
is
a
weak
and
paltry
thing
so
long
as
it
is
not
wholly
free
reason
the
fact
lies
in
its
very
nature
and
is
revealed
by
its
entire
history
a
man
may
be
perfectly
honest
in
a
contention
and
he
may
be
astute
and
persuasive
in
maintaining
it
but
the
moment
the
slightest
compulsion
to
maintain
it
is
laid
upon
him
the
moment
the
slightest
external
reward
goes
with
his
partisanship
or
the
slightest
penalty
with
its
abandonment
then
there
appears
a
defect
in
his
ratiocination
that
is
more
than
any
error
in
fact
and
more
destructive
than
any
conscious
and
deliberate
bias
he
may
seek
the
truth
and
the
truth
only
and
bring
up
his
highest
talents
and
diligence
to
the
business
but
always
there
is
a
specter
behind
his
chair
a
warning
in
his
ear
always
it
is
safer
and
more
hygienic
for
him
to
think
one
way
than
to
think
another
way
and
in
that
bald
fact
there
is
excuse
enough
to
hold
his
whole
chain
of
syllogisms
in
suspicion
he
may
be
earnest
he
may
be
honest
but
he
is
not
free
and
if
he
is
not
free
he
is
not
anything
well
are
the
reverend
professors
of
economics
free
with
the
highest
respect
i
presume
to
question
it
their
colleagues
of
archeology
may
be
reasonably
called
free
and
their
colleagues
of
bacteriology
and
those
of
latin
grammar
and
sidereal
astronomy
and
those
of
many
another
science
and
mystery
but
when
one
comes
to
the
faculty
of
political
economy
one
finds
that
freedom
as
plainly
conditioned
though
perhaps
not
as
openly
as
in
the
faculty
of
theology
and
for
a
plain
reason
political
economy
so
to
speak
hits
the
employers
of
the
professors
where
they
live
it
deals
not
with
ideas
that
affect
those
employers
only
occasionally
or
only
indirectly
or
only
as
ideas
but
with
ideas
that
have
an
imminent
and
continuous
influence
upon
their
personal
welfare
and
security
and
that
affect
profoundly
the
very
foundations
of
that
social
and
economic
structure
upon
which
their
whole
existence
is
based
it
is
in
brief
the
science
of
the
ways
and
means
whereby
they
have
come
to
such
estate
and
maintain
themselves
in
such
estate
that
they
are
able
to
hire
and
boss
professors
it
is
the
boat
in
which
they
sail
down
perilous
waters
and
they
must
needs
yell
or
be
more
or
less
than
human
when
it
is
rocked
now
and
then
that
yell
duly
resounds
in
the
groves
of
learning
one
remembers
for
example
the
trial
condemnation
and
execution
of
scott
nearing
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
a
seminary
that
is
highly
typical
both
in
its
staff
and
in
its
control
nearing
i
have
no
doubt
was
wrong
in
his
notions
honestly
perhaps
but
still
wrong
in
so
far
as
i
heard
them
stated
at
the
time
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
hollow
and
of
no
validity
he
has
since
discharged
them
from
the
chautauquan
stump
and
at
the
usual
hinds
they
have
been
chiefly
accepted
and
celebrated
by
men
i
regard
as
asses
but
nearing
was
not
thrown
out
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
angrily
and
ignominiously
because
he
was
honestly
wrong
or
because
his
errors
made
him
incompetent
to
prepare
sophomores
for
their
examinations
he
was
thrown
out
because
his
efforts
to
get
at
the
truth
disturbed
the
security
and
equanimity
of
the
rich
ignoranti
who
happened
to
control
the
university
and
because
the
academic
slaves
and
satellites
of
these
shopmen
were
restive
under
his
competition
for
the
attention
of
the
in
three
words
he
was
thrown
out
because
he
was
not
safe
and
sane
and
orthodox
had
his
aberration
gone
in
the
other
direction
had
he
defended
child
labor
as
ardently
as
he
denounced
it
and
denounced
the
minimum
wage
as
ardently
as
he
defended
it
then
he
would
have
been
quite
as
secure
in
his
post
for
all
his
cavorting
in
the
newspapers
as
chancellor
day
was
at
syracuse
now
consider
the
case
of
the
professors
of
economics
near
and
far
who
have
been
thrown
out
who
will
say
that
the
lesson
of
the
nearing
has
been
lost
upon
them
who
will
say
that
the
potency
of
the
wealthy
men
who
command
our
universities
or
most
of
them
has
not
stuck
in
their
minds
and
who
will
say
that
with
this
sticking
remembered
their
arguments
against
nearing
ideas
are
as
worthy
of
confidence
and
respect
as
they
would
be
if
they
were
quite
free
to
go
over
to
nearing
side
without
damage
who
indeed
will
give
them
full
credit
even
when
they
are
right
so
long
as
they
are
hamstrung
and
tied
up
in
gilded
pens
it
seems
to
me
that
these
considerations
are
enough
to
cast
a
glow
of
suspicion
over
the
whole
of
american
political
economy
at
least
in
so
far
as
it
comes
from
college
economists
and
in
the
main
it
has
that
source
for
barring
a
few
brilliant
journalists
all
our
economists
of
any
repute
are
professors
many
of
them
are
able
men
and
most
of
them
are
undoubtedly
honest
men
as
honesty
goes
in
the
world
but
over
practically
every
one
of
them
there
stands
a
board
of
trustees
with
its
legs
in
the
and
its
eyes
on
the
established
order
and
that
board
is
ever
alert
for
heresy
in
the
science
of
its
being
and
has
ready
means
of
punishing
it
and
a
hearty
enthusiasm
for
the
business
not
every
professor
perhaps
may
be
sent
straight
to
the
block
as
nearing
was
but
there
are
plenty
of
pillories
and
guardhouses
on
the
way
and
every
last
pedagogue
must
be
well
aware
of
it
political
economy
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
science
at
all
was
not
pumped
up
and
embellished
by
any
such
academic
clients
and
men
it
was
put
on
its
legs
by
inquirers
who
were
not
only
safe
from
all
dousing
in
the
campus
pump
but
who
were
also
free
from
the
mental
timorousness
and
conformity
which
go
inevitably
with
in
brief
by
men
of
the
world
accustomed
to
its
free
air
its
hospitality
to
originality
and
plain
speaking
adam
smith
true
enough
was
once
a
professor
but
he
threw
up
his
chair
to
go
to
paris
and
there
he
met
not
more
professors
but
all
the
current
enemies
of
professors
the
nearings
and
henry
georges
and
karl
marxes
of
the
time
and
the
book
that
he
wrote
was
not
orthodox
but
revolutionary
consider
the
others
of
that
bulk
and
beam
bentham
ricardo
mill
and
their
like
bentham
held
no
post
at
the
mercy
of
bankers
and
tripesellers
he
was
a
man
of
independent
means
a
lawyer
and
politician
and
a
heretic
in
general
practice
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
such
a
man
occupying
a
chair
at
harvard
or
princeton
he
had
a
hand
in
too
many
pies
he
was
too
rebellious
and
contumacious
he
had
too
little
respect
for
authority
either
academic
or
worldly
moreover
his
mind
was
too
wide
for
a
professor
he
could
never
remain
safely
in
a
groove
the
whole
field
of
social
organization
invited
his
inquiries
and
experiments
ricardo
another
man
of
easy
means
and
great
worldly
experience
by
academic
standards
not
even
educated
i
daresay
such
meager
diplomas
as
he
could
show
would
not
suffice
to
get
him
an
instructor
berth
in
a
seminary
in
iowa
as
for
mill
he
was
so
well
grounded
by
his
father
that
he
knew
more
at
eighteen
than
any
of
the
universities
could
teach
him
and
his
life
thereafter
was
the
exact
antithesis
of
that
of
a
cloistered
pedagogue
moreover
he
was
a
heretic
in
religion
and
probably
violated
the
mann
act
of
those
days
an
offense
almost
as
heinous
in
a
college
professor
of
economics
as
giving
three
cheers
for
prince
kropotkin
i
might
lengthen
the
list
but
humanely
refrain
the
point
is
that
these
early
english
economists
were
all
perfectly
free
men
with
complete
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
as
they
saw
it
regardless
of
its
orthodoxy
or
lack
of
orthodoxy
i
do
not
say
that
the
typical
american
economist
of
is
not
as
honest
nor
even
that
he
is
not
as
diligent
and
competent
but
i
do
say
that
he
is
not
as
free
that
penalties
would
come
upon
him
for
stating
ideas
that
smith
or
ricardo
or
bentham
or
mill
had
he
so
desired
would
have
been
free
to
state
without
damage
and
in
that
menace
there
is
an
ineradicable
criticism
of
the
ideas
that
he
does
state
and
it
lingers
even
when
they
are
plausible
and
are
accepted
in
france
and
germany
where
the
universities
and
colleges
are
controlled
by
the
state
the
practical
effect
of
such
pressure
has
been
frequently
demonstrated
in
the
former
country
the
violent
debate
over
social
and
economic
problems
during
the
quarter
century
before
the
war
produced
a
long
list
of
professors
cashiered
for
heterodoxy
headed
by
the
names
of
jean
jaurès
and
gustave
hervé
in
germany
it
needed
no
nietzsche
to
point
out
the
deadening
produced
by
this
state
control
germany
in
fact
got
out
of
it
an
entirely
new
species
of
economist
the
state
socialist
who
flirted
with
radicalism
with
one
eye
and
kept
the
other
upon
his
chair
his
salary
and
his
pension
the
nearing
case
and
the
rebellions
of
various
pedagogues
elsewhere
show
that
we
in
america
stand
within
the
shadow
of
a
somewhat
similar
danger
in
economics
as
in
the
other
sciences
we
are
probably
producing
men
who
are
as
good
as
those
on
view
in
any
other
country
they
are
not
to
be
surpassed
for
learning
and
originality
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
lack
honesty
and
courage
but
honesty
and
courage
as
men
go
in
the
world
are
after
all
merely
relative
values
there
comes
a
point
at
which
even
the
most
honest
man
considers
consequences
and
even
the
most
courageous
looks
before
he
leaps
the
difficulty
lies
in
establishing
the
position
of
that
point
so
long
as
it
is
in
doubt
there
will
remain
too
the
other
doubt
that
i
have
described
i
rise
in
meeting
i
repeat
not
as
a
radical
but
as
one
of
the
most
hunkerous
of
the
orthodox
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
dubious
in
fact
and
wobbly
in
logic
than
some
of
the
doctrines
that
amateur
economists
chiefly
socialists
have
set
afloat
in
this
country
during
the
past
dozen
years
i
have
even
gone
to
the
trouble
of
writing
a
book
against
them
my
convictions
and
instincts
are
all
on
the
other
side
but
i
should
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
in
those
convictions
and
instincts
if
i
were
convinced
that
the
learned
professors
were
really
in
full
and
absolute
possession
of
academic
freedom
if
i
could
imagine
them
taking
the
other
tack
now
and
then
without
damnation
to
their
jobs
their
lecture
dates
their
book
sales
and
their
hides
xvi
matters
of
state
contrat
all
government
in
its
essence
is
a
conspiracy
against
the
superior
man
its
one
permanent
object
is
to
police
him
and
cripple
him
if
it
be
aristocratic
in
organization
then
it
seeks
to
protect
the
man
who
is
superior
only
in
law
against
the
man
who
is
superior
in
fact
if
it
be
democratic
then
it
seeks
to
protect
the
man
who
is
inferior
in
every
way
against
both
thus
one
of
its
primary
functions
is
to
regiment
men
by
force
to
make
them
as
much
alike
as
possible
and
as
dependent
upon
one
another
as
possible
to
search
out
and
combat
originality
among
them
all
it
can
see
in
an
original
idea
is
potential
change
and
hence
an
invasion
of
its
prerogatives
the
most
dangerous
man
to
any
government
is
the
man
who
is
able
to
think
things
out
for
himself
without
regard
to
the
prevailing
superstitions
and
taboos
almost
inevitably
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
he
lives
under
is
dishonest
insane
and
intolerable
and
so
if
he
is
romantic
he
tries
to
change
it
and
even
if
he
is
not
romantic
personally
he
is
very
apt
to
spread
discontent
among
those
who
are
ludwig
van
beethoven
was
certainly
no
politician
nor
was
he
a
patriot
nor
had
he
any
democratic
illusions
in
him
he
held
the
viennese
in
even
more
contempt
than
he
held
the
hapsburgs
nevertheless
i
am
convinced
that
the
sharp
criticism
of
the
hapsburg
government
that
he
used
to
loose
in
the
cafés
of
vienna
had
its
effects
that
some
of
his
ideas
of
after
a
century
of
germination
got
themselves
translated
into
acts
in
beethoven
like
all
other
men
greatly
disliked
the
government
he
lived
under
i
add
the
names
of
goethe
heine
wagner
and
nietzsche
to
keep
among
germans
that
of
bismarck
might
follow
he
admired
the
hohenzollern
idea
as
carlyle
did
not
the
german
people
or
the
german
administration
in
his
errinerungen
whenever
he
discusses
the
government
that
he
was
a
part
of
he
has
difficulty
keeping
his
contempt
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
seems
to
me
the
man
who
proposes
a
change
in
the
government
he
lives
under
no
matter
how
defective
it
may
be
is
romantic
to
the
verge
of
sentimentality
there
is
seldom
if
ever
any
evidence
that
the
kind
of
government
he
is
unlawfully
inclined
to
would
be
any
better
than
the
government
he
proposes
to
supplant
political
revolutions
in
truth
do
not
often
accomplish
anything
of
genuine
value
their
one
undoubted
effect
is
simply
to
throw
out
one
gang
of
thieves
and
put
in
another
after
a
revolution
of
course
the
successful
revolutionists
always
try
to
convince
doubters
that
they
have
achieved
great
things
and
usually
they
hang
any
man
who
denies
it
but
that
surely
does
prove
their
case
in
russia
for
many
years
the
plain
people
were
taught
that
getting
rid
of
the
czar
would
make
them
all
rich
and
happy
but
now
that
they
have
got
rid
of
him
they
are
poorer
and
unhappier
than
ever
before
the
germans
with
the
kaiser
in
exile
have
discovered
that
a
shoemaker
turned
statesman
is
ten
times
as
bad
as
a
hohenzollern
the
alsatians
having
become
frenchmen
again
after
years
anxious
wait
have
responded
to
the
boon
by
becoming
extravagant
germanomaniacs
the
tyrolese
though
they
hated
the
austrians
now
hate
the
italians
enormously
more
the
irish
having
rid
themselves
of
the
english
after
years
of
struggle
instantly
discovered
that
government
by
englishmen
compared
to
government
by
irishmen
was
almost
paradisiacal
even
the
american
colonies
gained
little
by
their
revolt
in
for
years
after
the
revolution
they
were
in
far
worse
condition
as
free
states
than
they
would
have
been
as
colonies
their
government
was
more
expensive
more
inefficient
more
dishonest
and
more
tyrannical
it
was
only
the
gradual
material
progress
of
the
country
that
saved
them
from
starvation
and
collapse
and
that
material
progress
was
due
not
to
the
virtues
of
their
new
government
but
to
the
lavishness
of
nature
under
the
british
hoof
they
would
have
got
on
just
as
well
and
probably
a
great
deal
better
the
ideal
government
of
all
reflective
men
from
aristotle
to
herbert
spencer
is
one
which
lets
the
individual
alone
one
which
barely
escapes
being
no
government
at
all
this
ideal
i
believe
will
be
realized
in
the
world
twenty
or
thirty
centuries
after
i
have
passed
from
these
scenes
and
taken
up
my
home
in
hell
it
is
a
commonplace
of
historical
science
that
the
forgotten
worthies
who
framed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
had
no
belief
in
democracy
dr
beard
in
a
slim
sad
book
has
laboriously
proved
that
most
obvious
of
obviousities
two
prime
objects
are
visible
in
the
constitution
beautifully
enshrouded
in
disarming
words
to
protect
property
and
to
safeguard
minorities
in
brief
to
hold
the
superior
few
harmless
against
the
inferior
many
the
first
object
is
still
carried
out
despite
the
effort
of
democratic
law
to
make
capital
an
outlaw
the
second
alas
has
been
defeated
completely
what
is
worse
it
has
been
defeated
in
the
very
holy
of
holies
of
those
who
sought
to
attain
it
which
is
to
say
in
the
funereal
chamber
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
bit
by
bit
this
great
bench
of
master
minds
has
gradually
established
the
doctrine
that
a
minority
in
the
republic
has
no
rights
whatever
if
they
still
exist
theoretically
as
fossils
surviving
from
better
days
there
is
certainly
no
machinery
left
for
protecting
and
enforcing
them
the
current
majority
if
it
so
desired
could
add
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
prohibiting
the
ancient
confederate
vice
of
chewing
the
compressed
leaves
of
the
tobacco
plant
nicotiana
tabacum
the
supreme
court
which
has
long
since
forgotten
the
bill
of
rights
would
promptly
issue
a
writ
of
obstat
with
a
series
of
moral
reflections
as
more
the
supreme
court
would
as
promptly
uphold
a
law
prohibiting
the
chewing
of
gum
achras
sapota
on
the
ground
that
any
unnecessary
chewing
however
harmless
in
itself
might
tempt
great
hordes
of
morons
to
chew
tobacco
this
is
not
a
mere
torturing
of
sardonic
theory
the
thing
has
been
actually
done
in
the
case
of
prohibition
the
eighteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages
the
supreme
court
has
decided
plainly
that
in
order
to
enforce
it
congress
also
has
the
right
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
beverages
that
are
admittedly
intoxicating
it
could
indeed
specifically
prohibit
or
any
drink
containing
malt
or
hops
however
low
in
alcohol
the
more
extreme
prohibitionists
actually
demand
that
it
do
so
forthwith
worse
a
minority
not
only
has
no
more
inalienable
rights
in
the
united
states
it
is
not
even
lawfully
entitled
to
be
heard
this
was
well
established
by
the
case
of
the
socialists
elected
to
the
new
york
assembly
what
the
voters
who
elected
these
socialists
asked
for
was
simply
the
privilege
of
choosing
spokesmen
to
voice
their
doctrines
in
a
perfectly
lawful
and
peaceable
manner
nothing
more
this
privilege
was
denied
them
in
precisely
the
same
way
the
present
national
house
of
representatives
which
happens
to
be
republican
in
complexion
might
expel
all
of
its
democratic
members
the
voters
who
elected
them
would
have
no
redress
if
the
same
men
were
elected
again
or
other
men
of
the
same
views
they
might
be
expelled
again
more
it
would
apparently
be
perfectly
constitutional
for
the
majority
in
congress
to
pass
a
statute
denying
the
use
of
the
mails
to
the
minority
that
is
for
the
republicans
to
bar
all
democratic
papers
from
the
mails
i
do
not
toy
with
mere
theories
the
thing
has
actually
been
done
in
the
case
of
the
socialists
under
the
present
law
indeed
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
the
without
any
further
authority
from
congress
might
deny
the
mails
to
all
democrats
or
to
all
catholics
or
to
all
or
to
all
violoncellists
yet
more
a
citizen
who
happens
to
belong
to
a
minority
is
not
even
safe
in
his
person
he
may
be
put
into
prison
and
for
very
long
periods
for
the
simple
offense
of
differing
from
the
majority
this
happened
it
will
be
recalled
in
the
case
of
debs
debs
by
no
means
advised
citizens
subject
to
military
duty
in
time
of
war
to
evade
that
duty
as
the
newspapers
of
the
time
alleged
on
the
contrary
he
advised
them
to
meet
and
discharge
that
duty
all
he
did
was
to
say
that
even
in
time
of
war
he
was
against
war
that
he
regarded
it
as
a
barbarous
method
of
settling
disputes
between
nations
for
thus
differing
from
the
majority
on
a
question
of
mere
theory
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
in
prison
the
case
of
the
three
young
russians
arrested
in
new
york
was
even
more
curious
these
poor
idiots
were
jailed
for
the
almost
incredible
crime
of
circulating
purely
academic
protests
against
making
war
upon
a
country
with
which
the
united
states
was
legally
at
peace
to
wit
russia
for
this
preposterous
offense
two
of
them
were
sent
to
prison
for
fifteen
years
and
one
a
girl
for
ten
years
and
the
supreme
court
upheld
their
convictions
here
was
a
plain
case
of
proscription
and
punishment
for
a
mere
opinion
there
was
absolutely
no
contention
that
the
protest
of
the
three
prisoners
could
have
any
practical
result
that
it
might
for
example
destroy
the
of
american
soldiers
miles
away
and
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
united
states
the
three
victims
were
ordered
to
be
punished
in
that
appalling
manner
simply
because
they
ventured
to
criticise
an
executive
usurpation
which
happened
at
the
moment
to
have
the
support
of
public
opinion
and
particularly
of
the
then
president
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
holders
of
russian
government
securities
it
must
be
obvious
viewing
such
leading
cases
critically
and
hundreds
like
them
might
be
cited
that
the
old
rights
of
the
free
american
so
carefully
laid
down
by
the
bill
of
rights
are
now
worth
nothing
bit
by
bit
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
have
invaded
and
nullified
them
and
they
are
so
flimsy
that
no
lawyer
not
insane
would
attempt
to
defend
his
client
by
bringing
them
up
imagine
trying
to
defend
a
man
denied
the
use
of
the
mails
by
the
without
hearing
or
even
formal
notice
on
the
ground
that
the
constitution
guarantees
the
right
of
free
speech
the
very
catchpolls
in
the
courtroom
would
snicker
i
say
that
the
legislative
arm
is
primarily
responsible
for
this
gradual
enslavement
of
the
americano
the
truth
is
of
course
that
the
executive
and
judicial
arms
are
responsible
to
a
scarcely
less
degree
our
law
has
not
kept
pace
with
the
development
of
our
bureaucracy
there
is
no
machinery
provided
for
curbing
its
excesses
in
prussia
in
the
old
days
there
were
special
courts
for
the
purpose
and
a
citizen
oppressed
by
the
police
or
by
any
other
public
official
could
get
relief
and
redress
the
guilty
functionary
could
be
fined
mulcted
in
damages
demoted
cashiered
or
even
jailed
but
in
the
united
states
there
are
no
such
tribunals
a
citizen
attacked
by
the
simply
has
no
redress
whatever
the
courts
have
refused
over
and
over
again
to
interfere
save
in
cases
of
obvious
fraud
nor
is
there
it
would
seem
any
remedy
for
the
unconstitutional
acts
of
prohibition
agents
some
time
ago
when
senator
stanley
of
kentucky
tried
to
have
a
law
passed
forbidding
them
to
break
into
a
citizen
house
in
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights
the
prohibitionists
mustered
up
their
serfs
in
the
senate
against
him
and
he
was
voted
down
the
supreme
court
had
it
been
so
disposed
might
have
put
a
stop
to
all
this
sinister
buffoonery
long
ago
there
was
a
time
indeed
when
it
was
alert
to
do
so
that
was
during
the
civil
war
but
since
then
the
court
has
gradually
succumbed
to
the
prevailing
doctrine
that
the
minority
has
no
rights
that
the
majority
is
bound
to
respect
as
it
is
at
present
constituted
it
shows
little
disposition
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
harassed
freeman
when
property
is
menaced
it
displays
a
laudable
diligence
but
when
it
comes
to
the
mere
rights
of
the
citizen
it
seems
hopelessly
inclined
to
give
the
prosecution
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
two
justices
commonly
dissent
two
out
of
nine
they
hold
the
last
of
the
old
constitutional
line
when
they
depart
to
realms
of
bliss
the
bill
of
rights
will
be
buried
with
them
xvii
reflections
on
the
drama
the
drama
is
the
most
democratic
of
the
art
forms
and
perhaps
the
only
one
that
may
legitimately
bear
the
label
painting
sculpture
music
and
literature
so
far
as
they
show
any
genuine
æsthetic
or
intellectual
content
at
all
are
not
for
crowds
but
for
selected
individuals
mostly
with
bad
kidneys
and
worse
morals
and
three
of
the
four
are
almost
always
enjoyed
in
actual
solitude
even
architecture
and
religious
ritual
though
they
are
publicly
displayed
make
their
chief
appeal
to
man
as
individual
not
to
man
as
mass
animal
one
goes
into
a
church
as
part
of
a
crowd
true
enough
but
if
it
be
a
church
that
has
risen
above
mere
theological
disputation
to
the
beauty
of
ceremonial
one
is
even
in
theory
alone
with
the
lord
god
jehovah
and
if
passing
up
fifth
avenue
in
the
throng
one
pauses
before
thomas
to
drink
in
the
beauty
of
that
archaic
façade
one
drinking
is
almost
sure
to
be
done
cappella
of
the
other
not
one
in
a
thousand
so
much
as
glances
at
it
but
the
drama
as
representation
is
inconceivable
save
as
a
show
for
the
mob
and
so
it
has
to
take
on
protective
coloration
to
survive
it
must
make
its
appeal
not
to
individuals
as
such
nor
even
to
individuals
as
units
in
the
mob
but
to
the
mob
as
mob
a
quite
different
thing
as
gustav
le
bon
long
ago
demonstrated
in
his
psychologie
des
foules
thus
its
intellectual
content
like
its
æsthetic
form
must
be
within
the
mental
grasp
of
the
mob
and
what
is
more
important
within
the
scope
of
its
prejudices
corollary
anything
even
remotely
approaching
an
original
idea
or
an
unpopular
idea
is
foreign
to
it
and
if
it
would
make
any
impression
at
all
abhorrent
to
it
the
best
a
dramatist
can
hope
to
do
is
to
give
poignant
and
arresting
expression
to
an
idea
so
simple
that
the
average
man
will
grasp
it
at
once
and
so
banal
that
he
will
approve
it
in
the
next
instant
the
phrase
drama
of
ideas
thus
becomes
a
mere
phrase
what
is
actually
meant
by
it
is
drama
of
platitudes
so
much
for
the
theory
an
appeal
to
the
facts
quickly
substantiates
it
the
more
one
looks
into
the
drama
of
ideas
of
the
last
age
that
is
into
the
acting
drama
the
more
one
is
astounded
by
the
vacuity
of
its
content
the
younger
dumas
la
dame
aux
camélias
the
first
of
all
the
propaganda
plays
it
raised
a
stupendous
pother
in
the
echoes
of
which
yet
roll
is
based
upon
the
sophomoric
thesis
that
a
prostitute
is
a
human
being
like
you
and
me
and
suffers
the
slings
and
arrows
of
the
same
sorrows
and
may
be
potentially
quite
as
worthy
of
heaven
augier
le
mariage
another
pioneer
is
even
hollower
its
four
acts
are
devoted
to
rubbing
in
the
revolutionary
discovery
that
it
is
unwise
for
a
young
man
of
good
family
to
marry
an
elderly
cocotte
proceed
now
to
ibsen
here
one
finds
the
same
tasteless
platitudes
that
it
is
unpleasant
for
a
wife
to
be
treated
as
a
doll
that
professional
patriots
and
town
boomers
are
frauds
that
success
in
business
is
often
grounded
upon
a
mere
willingness
to
do
what
a
man
of
honor
is
incapable
of
that
a
woman
who
continues
to
live
with
a
debauched
husband
may
expect
to
have
unhealthy
children
that
a
joint
sorrow
tends
to
bring
husband
and
wife
together
that
a
neurotic
woman
is
apt
to
prefer
death
to
maternity
that
a
man
of
is
an
ass
to
fall
in
love
with
a
flapper
of
do
i
burlesque
if
you
think
so
turn
to
ibsen
nachgelassene
schriften
and
read
his
own
statements
of
the
ideas
in
his
social
dramas
read
his
own
succinct
summaries
of
their
theses
you
will
imagine
yourself
on
more
than
one
page
in
the
latest
volume
of
mush
by
orison
swett
marden
such
ideas
are
what
one
finds
in
newspaper
editorials
speeches
before
congress
sermons
by
evangelical
divines
in
brief
in
the
literature
expressly
addressed
to
those
persons
whose
distinguishing
mark
is
that
ideas
never
enter
their
heads
ibsen
himself
an
excellent
poet
and
a
reflective
man
was
under
no
delusions
about
his
dramas
of
ideas
it
astounded
him
greatly
when
the
sentimental
german
hailed
ein
puppenheim
as
a
revolutionary
document
he
protested
often
and
bitterly
against
being
mistaken
for
a
prophet
of
feminism
his
own
interest
in
this
play
and
in
those
that
followed
it
was
chiefly
technical
he
was
trying
to
displace
the
play
of
scribe
and
company
with
something
simpler
more
elastic
and
more
hospitable
to
character
he
wrote
ghosts
to
raise
a
laugh
against
the
fools
who
had
seen
something
novel
and
horrible
in
the
idea
of
a
doll
house
he
wanted
to
prove
to
them
that
that
idea
was
no
more
than
a
platitude
soon
afterward
he
became
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
whole
drama
of
ideas
in
the
wild
duck
he
cruelly
burlesqued
it
and
made
a
ibsenist
his
chief
butt
in
hedda
gabler
he
played
a
joke
on
the
ibsen
fanatics
by
fashioning
a
drama
out
of
the
oldest
shoddiest
materials
of
sardou
feuillet
and
even
meilhac
and
halévy
and
beginning
with
little
eyolf
he
threw
the
drama
of
ideas
overboard
forever
and
took
to
mysticism
what
could
be
more
comical
than
the
efforts
of
critical
talmudists
to
read
a
thesis
into
when
we
dead
awaken
i
have
put
in
many
a
gay
hour
perusing
their
commentaries
ibsen
had
he
lived
would
have
roared
over
them
as
he
roared
over
the
effort
to
inject
portentous
meanings
into
the
master
builder
at
bottom
no
more
than
a
sentimental
epitaph
to
a
love
affair
that
he
himself
had
suffered
at
gerhart
hauptmann
another
dramatist
of
the
first
rank
has
gone
much
the
same
road
as
a
very
young
man
he
succumbed
to
the
drama
of
ideas
gabble
and
his
first
plays
showed
an
effort
to
preach
this
or
that
in
awful
tones
but
he
soon
discovered
that
the
only
ideas
that
would
go
down
so
to
speak
on
the
stage
were
ideas
of
such
an
austere
platitudinousness
that
it
was
beneath
his
artistic
dignity
to
merchant
them
and
so
he
gave
over
propaganda
altogether
in
other
words
his
genius
burst
through
the
narrow
bounds
of
mob
ratiocination
and
he
began
appealing
to
the
universal
emotions
pity
religious
sentiment
patriotism
amorousness
even
in
his
first
play
vor
sonnenaufgang
his
instinct
got
the
better
of
his
mistaken
purpose
and
reading
it
one
finds
that
the
sheer
horror
of
it
is
of
vastly
more
effect
than
its
nebulous
and
unimportant
ideas
it
really
says
nothing
it
merely
makes
us
dislike
some
very
unpleasant
people
turn
now
to
shaw
at
once
one
finds
that
the
only
plays
from
his
pen
which
contain
actual
ideas
have
failed
dismally
on
the
stage
these
are
the
discussions
getting
married
the
successful
plays
contain
no
ideas
they
contain
only
platitudes
balderdash
buncombe
that
even
a
suffragette
might
think
of
of
such
sort
are
man
and
superman
arms
and
the
man
candida
androcles
and
the
lion
and
their
like
shaw
has
given
all
of
these
pieces
a
specious
air
of
profundity
by
publishing
them
hooked
to
long
and
garrulous
prefaces
and
by
filling
them
with
stage
directions
which
describe
and
discuss
the
characters
at
great
length
but
as
stage
plays
they
are
almost
as
empty
as
hedda
gabier
one
searches
them
vainly
for
even
the
slightest
novel
contribution
to
the
current
theories
of
life
joy
and
crime
shaw
prefaces
of
course
have
vastly
more
ideational
force
and
respectability
than
his
plays
if
he
fails
to
get
any
ideas
of
genuine
savor
into
them
it
is
not
because
the
preface
form
bars
them
out
but
because
he
has
any
to
get
in
by
attaching
them
to
his
plays
he
converts
the
latter
into
colorable
imitations
of
novels
and
so
opens
the
way
for
that
superior
reflectiveness
which
lifts
the
novel
above
the
play
and
makes
it
as
arnold
bennett
has
convincingly
shown
much
harder
to
write
a
stage
play
in
the
modern
realistic
manner
that
is
without
soliloquies
and
asides
can
seldom
rise
above
the
mere
representation
of
some
infinitesimal
episode
whereas
even
the
worst
novel
may
be
in
some
sense
an
interpretation
as
well
obviously
such
episodes
as
may
be
exposed
in
words
the
extreme
limit
of
the
average
play
are
seldom
significant
and
not
often
clearly
intelligible
the
author
has
a
hard
enough
job
making
his
characters
recognizable
as
human
beings
he
has
time
to
go
behind
their
acts
to
their
motives
or
to
deduce
any
conclusions
worth
hearing
from
their
doings
one
often
leaves
a
social
drama
indeed
wondering
what
the
deuce
it
is
all
about
the
discussion
of
its
meaning
offers
endless
opportunities
for
theorists
and
fanatics
the
ibsen
symbolists
come
to
mind
again
they
read
meanings
into
such
plays
as
rosmersholm
and
the
wild
duck
that
aroused
ibsen
a
peaceful
man
to
positive
fury
in
the
same
way
the
suffragettes
collared
a
house
even
peer
gynt
did
not
escape
there
is
actually
an
edition
of
it
edited
by
a
theosophist
in
the
preface
to
which
it
is
hymned
as
a
theosophical
document
luckily
for
ibsen
he
died
before
this
edition
was
printed
but
one
may
well
imagine
how
it
would
have
made
him
swear
the
notion
that
there
are
ideas
in
the
drama
of
ideas
in
truth
is
confined
to
a
special
class
of
illuminati
whose
chief
visible
character
is
their
capacity
for
ingesting
nonsense
maeterlinckians
uplifters
women
clubbers
believers
in
all
the
sure
cures
for
all
the
sorrows
of
the

carries
on
the
tradition

is
composed
of
the
eternally
young
unsuccessful

yet
live

young

psychopathic
old

an
incurable

innumerable

ingenuous

of

parlor
metaphysician
and
of
the
novelists
praised
by
the
newspapers

of
such
composers
as

massenet
these
are
the
fair
ones

who
were
ecstatically
shocked
by
the
platitudes
of
damaged
goods
and
who
regard
augustus

a

and
what
is
more
as
a
great

their

or
two

baptist
august
strindberg
a
lunatic
with
a
gift
for
turning
the
preposterous
into
the
shocking
a
glance
at
strindberg
innumerable
volumes
of
autobiography
reveals
the
true
of
his
ideas
he
believed
in
everything
that
was
idiotic
from
transcendentalism
to
witchcraft
he
believed
that
his
enemies
were
seeking
to
destroy
him
by
magic
he
spent
a
whole
winter
trying
to
find
the
philosopher
stone
even
among
the
clergy
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
more
astounding
ass
than
strindberg
but
he
had
for
all
his
folly
a
considerable
native
skill
at
devising
effective
a
talent
that
some
men
seem
to
be
born
with
and
under
cover
of
it
he
acquired
his
reputation
as
a
thinker
here
he
was
met
by
the
defective
powers
of
observation
and
reflection
of
his
followers
the
aforesaid
they
mistook
their
enjoyment
of
his
adept
technical
trickery
for
an
appreciation
of
ideas
turn
to
the
best
of
his
plays
the
father
here
the
idea
that
domestic
nagging
can
cause
insanity
is
an
almost
perfect
platitude
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
universally
admitted
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
true
but
as
a
stage
play
pure
and
simple
the
piece
is
superb
a
simple
and
yet
enormously
effective
mechanism
so
with
countess
julie
the
idea
here
is
so
vague
and
incomprehensible
that
no
two
commentators
agree
in
stating
it
and
yet
the
play
is
so
cleverly
written
and
appeals
with
such
a
sure
touch
to
the
universal
human
weakness
for
the
obscene
that
it
never
fails
to
enchant
an
audience
the
case
of
hedda
gabier
is
parallel
if
the
actresses
playing
hedda
in
this
country
made
up
for
the
part
in
the
scandalous
way
their
sisters
do
in
germany
that
is
by
wearing
bustles
in
front
it
would
be
as
great
a
success
here
as
it
is
over
there
its
general
failure
among
us
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
made
indelicate
enough
this
also
explains
the
comparative
failure
of
the
rest
of
the
ibsen
plays
the
crowd
has
been
subtly
made
to
believe
that
they
are
magnificently
indecent
and
is
always
dashed
and
displeased
when
it
finds
nothing
to
lift
the
diaphragm
i
well
remember
the
first
production
of
ghosts
in
america
a
business
in
which
i
had
a
hand
so
eager
was
the
audience
for
the
promised
indecencies
that
it
actually
read
them
into
the
play
and
there
were
protests
against
it
on
the
ground
that
alving
was
represented
as
trying
to
seduce
her
own
son
here
comstockery
often
helps
the
drama
of
ideas
if
no
other
idea
is
visible
it
can
always
conjure
up
out
of
its
native
swinishness
some
idea
that
is
offensively
sexual
and
hence
pleasing
to
the
mob
that
mob
rules
in
the
theater
and
so
the
theater
remains
infantile
and
trivial
a
scene
not
of
the
exposure
of
ideas
nor
even
of
the
exhibition
of
beauty
but
one
merely
of
the
parading
of
mental
and
physical
prettiness
and
vulgarity
it
is
at
its
worst
when
its
dramatists
seek
to
corrupt
this
function
by
adding
a
moral
or
intellectual
purpose
it
is
at
its
best
when
it
confines
itself
to
the
unrealities
that
are
its
essence
and
swings
amiably
from
the
romance
that
never
was
on
land
or
sea
to
the
buffoonery
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
we
actually
know
of
human
life
shakespeare
was
its
greatest
craftsman
he
wasted
no
tortured
ratiocination
upon
his
plays
instead
he
filled
them
with
the
gaudy
heroes
that
all
of
us
see
ourselves
becoming
on
some
bright
and
the
lowly
frauds
and
clowns
we
are
no
psychopathic
problems
engaged
him
he
took
love
and
ambition
and
revenge
and
braggadocio
as
he
found
them
he
held
no
clinics
in
dingy
norwegian
his
field
was
bohemia
glorious
rome
the
egypt
of
the
arcady
but
even
shakespeare
for
all
the
vast
potency
of
his
incomparable
his
stupefying
poetry
could
not
long
hold
the
talmudists
out
in
front
from
their
search
for
invisible
significances
think
of
all
the
tomes
that
have
been
written
upon
the
profound
and
revolutionary
ideas
in
the
moony

of

advice
to
young
men
him
that
the
most
valuable
of
all
human
possessions
next
to
a
superior
and
disdainful
air
is
the
reputation
of
being
well
to
do
nothing
else
so
neatly
eases
one
way
through
life
especially
in
democratic
countries
there
is
in
per
cent
of
all
democrats
an
irresistible
impulse
to
crook
the
knee
to
wealth
to
defer
humbly
to
the
power
that
goes
with
it
to
see
all
sorts
of
high
merits
in
the
man
who
has
it
or
is
said
to
have
it
true
enough
envy
goes
with
the
pliant
neck
but
it
is
envy
somehow
purged
of
all
menace
the
inferior
man
is
afraid
to
do
evil
to
the
man
with
money
in
eight
banks
he
is
even
afraid
to
evil
of
him
that
is
in
any
patent
and
offensive
way
against
capital
as
an
abstraction
he
rants
incessantly
and
all
of
the
laws
that
he
favors
treat
it
as
if
it
were
criminal
but
in
the
presence
of
the
concrete
capitalist
he
is
singularly
fawning
what
makes
him
so
is
easy
to
discern
he
yearns
with
a
great
yearning
for
a
chance
to
tap
the
capitalist
purse
and
he
knows
very
well
deep
down
in
his
heart
that
he
is
too
craven
and
stupid
to
do
it
by
force
of
arms
so
he
turns
to
politeness
and
tries
to
cajole
give
out
the
news
that
one
has
just
made
a
killing
in
the
stock
market
or
robbed
some
confiding
widow
of
her
dower
or
swindled
the
government
in
some
patriotic
enterprise
and
at
once
one
will
discover
that
shabbiness
is
a
charming
eccentricity
and
one
judgment
of
wines
worth
hearing
and
one
politics
worthy
of
attention
and
respect
the
man
who
is
thought
to
be
poor
never
gets
a
fair
chance
no
one
wants
to
listen
to
him
no
one
gives
a
damn
what
he
thinks
or
knows
or
feels
no
one
has
any
active
desire
for
his
good
opinion
i
discovered
this
principle
early
in
life
and
have
put
it
to
use
ever
since
i
have
got
a
great
deal
more
out
of
men
and
women
by
having
the
name
of
being
a
fellow
than
i
have
ever
got
by
being
decent
to
them
or
by
dazzling
them
with
my
sagacity
or
by
hard
industry
or
by
a
personal
beauty
that
is
singular
and
ineffable
venerable
the
older
i
grow
the
more
i
distrust
the
familiar
doctrine
that
age
brings
wisdom
it
is
my
honest
belief
that
i
am
no
wiser
than
i
was
five
or
ten
years
ago
in
fact
i
often
suspect
that
i
am
appreciable
wise
women
can
prevail
over
me
by
devices
that
would
have
made
me
hoof
them
out
of
my
studio
when
i
was
i
am
also
an
easier
mark
for
male
swindlers
than
i
used
to
be
at
fifty
i
probably
be
joining
clubs
and
buying
mexican
mine
stock
the
truth
is
that
every
man
goes
in
sagacity
to
a
certain
point
and
then
begins
sliding
down
again
nearly
all
the
old
fellows
that
i
know
are
more
or
less
balmy
theoretically
they
should
be
much
wiser
than
younger
men
if
only
because
of
their
greater
experience
but
actually
they
seem
to
take
on
folly
faster
than
they
take
on
wisdom
a
man
of
or
is
almost
for
a
woman
to
marry
him
is
a
herculean
feat
but
by
the
time
he
is
fifty
he
is
quite
as
easy
as
a
yale
sophomore
on
other
planes
the
same
decay
of
the
intelligence
is
visible
certainly
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
any
committee
of
relatively
young
men
of
thirty
or
showing
the
unbroken
childishness
ignorance
and
lack
of
humor
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
average
age
of
the
learned
justices
must
be
well
beyond
sixty
and
all
of
them
are
supposed
to
be
of
finished
and
mellowed
sagacity
yet
their
knowledge
of
the
most
ordinary
principles
of
justice
often
turns
out
to
be
extremely
meager
and
when
they
spread
themselves
grandly
upon
a
great
case
their
reasoning
powers
are
usually
found
to
be
precisely
equal
to
those
of
a
respectable
pullman
conductor
some
of
the
loosest
thinking
in
ethics
has
duty
for
its
theme
practically
all
writers
on
the
subject
agree
that
the
individual
owes
certain
unescapable
duties
to
the
race
for
example
the
duty
of
engaging
in
productive
labor
and
that
of
marrying
and
begetting
offspring
in
support
of
this
position
it
is
almost
always
argued
that
if
men
neglected
such
duties
the
race
would
perish
the
logic
is
hollow
enough
to
be
worthy
of
the
college
professors
who
are
guilty
of
it
it
simply
confuses
the
conventionality
the
pusillanimity
the
lack
of
imagination
of
the
majority
of
men
with
the
duty
of
men
there
is
not
the
slightest
ground
for
assuming
even
as
a
matter
of
mere
argumentation
that
men
will
ever
neglect
these
alleged
duties
there
will
always
remain
a
safe
majority
that
is
willing
to
do
whatever
is
ordained
that
accepts
docilely
the
government
it
is
born
under
obeys
its
laws
and
supports
its
theory
but
that
majority
does
not
comprise
the
men
who
render
the
highest
and
most
intelligent
services
to
the
race
it
comprises
those
who
render
nothing
save
their
obedience
for
the
man
who
differs
from
this
inert
and
mass
however
slightly
there
are
no
duties
what
he
is
spontaneously
inclined
to
do
is
of
vastly
more
value
to
all
of
us
than
what
the
majority
is
willing
to
do
there
is
indeed
no
such
thing
as
it
is
a
mere
chimera
of
ethical
theorists
human
progress
is
furthered
not
by
conformity
but
by
aberration
the
very
concept
of
duty
is
thus
a
function
of
inferiority
it
belongs
naturally
only
to
timorous
and
incompetent
men
even
on
such
levels
it
remains
largely
a
a
soothing
apparition
a
euphemism
for
necessity
when
a
man
succumbs
to
duty
he
merely
succumbs
to
the
habit
and
inclination
of
other
men
their
collective
interests
invariably
pull
against
his
individual
interests
some
of
us
can
resist
a
pretty
strong
pull
the
pull
perhaps
of
thousands
but
it
is
only
the
miraculous
man
who
can
withstand
the
pull
of
a
whole
nation
history
says
henry
ford
is
bunk
i
inscribe
myself
among
those
who
dissent
from
this
doctrine
nevertheless
i
am
often
hauled
up
in
reading
history
by
a
feeling
that
i
am
among
unrealities
in
particular
that
feeling
comes
over
me
when
i
read
about
the
religious
wars
of
the
past
wars
in
which
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
were
butchered
on
account
of
puerile
and
unintelligible
disputes
over
transubstantiation
the
atonement
and
other
such
metaphysical
banshees
it
does
not
surprise
me
that
the
majority
murdered
the
minority
the
majority
even
does
it
whenever
it
is
possible
what
i
ca
understand
is
that
the
minority
went
voluntarily
to
the
slaughter
even
in
the
worst
persecutions
known
to
history
say
for
example
those
of
the
jews
of
spain
it
was
always
possible
for
a
given
member
of
the
minority
to
save
his
hide
by
giving
public
assent
to
the
religious
notions
of
the
majority
a
jew
who
was
willing
to
be
baptized
in
the
reign
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
was
practically
unmolested
his
descendants
are
spaniards
well
then
why
did
so
many
jews
refuse
why
did
so
many
prefer
to
be
robbed
exiled
and
sometimes
murdered
the
answer
given
by
philosophical
historians
is
that
they
were
a
noble
people
and
preferred
death
to
heresy
but
this
merely
begs
the
question
is
it
actually
noble
to
cling
to
a
religious
idea
so
tenaciously
certainly
it
does
seem
so
to
me
after
all
no
human
being
really
anything
about
the
exalted
matters
with
which
all
religions
deal
the
most
he
can
do
is
to
match
his
private
guess
against
the
guesses
of
his
fellowmen
for
any
man
to
say
absolutely
in
such
a
field
that
this
or
that
is
wholly
and
irrefragably
true
and
this
or
that
is
utterly
false
is
simply
to
talk
nonsense
personally
i
have
never
encountered
a
religious
idea
and
i
do
not
except
even
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
god
that
was
instantly
and
unchallengeably
convincing
as
say
the
copernican
astronomy
is
instantly
and
unchallengeably
convincing
but
neither
have
i
ever
encountered
a
religious
idea
that
could
be
dismissed
offhand
as
palpably
and
indubitably
false
in
even
the
worst
nonsense
of
such
theological
mountebanks
as
the
rev
billy
sunday
brigham
young
and
eddy
there
is
always
enough
lingering
plausibility
or
at
all
events
possibility
to
give
the
judicious
pause
whatever
the
weight
of
the
probabilities
against
it
it
nevertheless
be
true
that
man
on
his
decease
turns
into
a
gaseous
vertebrate
and
that
this
vertebrate
if
its
human
larva
has
engaged
in
embezzlement
bootlegging
profanity
or
adultery
on
this
earth
will
be
boiled
for
a
million
years
in
a
cauldron
of
pitch
my
private
inclination
due
to
my
defective
upbringing
is
to
doubt
it
and
to
set
down
any
one
who
believes
it
as
an
ass
but
it
must
be
plain
that
i
have
no
means
of
disproving
it
in
view
of
this
uncertainty
it
seems
to
me
sheer
vanity
for
any
man
to
hold
his
religious
views
too
firmly
or
to
submit
to
any
inconvenience
on
account
of
them
it
is
far
better
if
they
happen
to
offend
to
conceal
them
discreetly
or
to
change
them
amiably
as
the
delusions
of
the
majority
change
my
own
views
in
this
department
being
wholly
skeptical
and
tolerant
are
obnoxious
to
the
subscribers
to
practically
all
other
views
even
atheists
sometimes
denounce
me
at
the
moment
by
an
accident
of
american
political
history
these
dissenters
from
my
theology
are
forbidden
to
punish
me
for
not
agreeing
with
them
but
at
any
succeeding
moment
some
group
or
other
among
them
may
seize
such
power
and
proceed
against
me
in
the
immemorial
manner
if
it
ever
happens
i
give
notice
here
and
now
that
i
shall
get
converted
to
their
nonsense
instantly
and
so
retire
to
safety
with
my
right
thumb
laid
against
my
nose
and
my
fingers
waving
like
wheat
in
the
wind
i
do
it
even
if
there
were
any
practical
advantage
in
it
offer
me
a
case
of
rauenthaler
and
i
engage
to
submit
to
baptism
by
any
rite
ever
heard
of
provided
it
does
not
expose
my
gothic
nakedness
make
it
ten
cases
and
i
agree
to
be
both
baptized
and
confirmed
in
such
matters
i
am
what
after
all
is
one
more
lie
disabled
the
science
of
psychological
pathology
is
still
in
its
infancy
in
all
its
literature
in
three
languages
i
ca
find
a
line
about
the
permanent
ill
effects
of
acute
emotional
diseases
say
for
example
love
affairs
the
common
assumption
of
the
world
is
that
when
a
love
affair
is
over
it
is
over
that
nothing
remains
behind
this
is
probably
grossly
untrue
it
is
my
belief
that
every
such
experience
leaves
scars
upon
my
psyche
and
that
they
are
quite
as
plain
and
quite
as
dangerous
as
the
scars
left
on
the
neck
by
a
carbuncle
a
man
who
has
passed
through
a
love
affair
even
though
he
may
eventually
forget
the
lady
very
name
is
never
quite
the
same
thereafter
his
scars
may
be
small
but
they
are
permanent
the
sentimentalist
exposed
incessantly
ends
as
a
psychic
cripple
he
is
as
badly
off
as
the
man
who
has
come
home
from
the
wars
with
the
precise
nature
of
the
scars
remains
to
be
determined
my
own
notion
is
that
they
take
the
form
of
large
yellow
patches
upon
the
whenever
a
man
thinks
of
one
of
his
dead
love
affairs
and
in
particular
whenever
he
allows
his
memory
to
dredge
up
an
image
of
the
woman
he
loved
he
shivers
like
one
taken
in
some
unmanly
and
discreditable
act
such
shivers
repeated
often
enough
must
inevitably
shake
his
inner
integrity
off
