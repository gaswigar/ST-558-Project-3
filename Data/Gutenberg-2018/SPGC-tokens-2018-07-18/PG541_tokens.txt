on
a
january
evening
of
the
early
seventies
christine
nilsson
was
singing
in
faust
at
the
academy
of
music
in
new
york
though
there
was
already
talk
of
the
erection
in
remote
metropolitan
distances
above
the
forties
of
a
new
opera
house
which
should
compete
in
costliness
and
splendour
with
those
of
the
great
european
capitals
the
world
of
fashion
was
still
content
to
reassemble
every
winter
in
the
shabby
red
and
gold
boxes
of
the
sociable
old
academy
conservatives
cherished
it
for
being
small
and
inconvenient
and
thus
keeping
out
the
new
people
whom
new
york
was
beginning
to
dread
and
yet
be
drawn
to
and
the
sentimental
clung
to
it
for
its
historic
associations
and
the
musical
for
its
excellent
acoustics
always
so
problematic
a
quality
in
halls
built
for
the
hearing
of
music
it
was
madame
nilsson
first
appearance
that
winter
and
what
the
daily
press
had
already
learned
to
describe
as
an
exceptionally
brilliant
audience
had
gathered
to
hear
her
transported
through
the
slippery
snowy
streets
in
private
broughams
in
the
spacious
family
landau
or
in
the
humbler
but
more
convenient
brown
coupe
to
come
to
the
opera
in
a
brown
coupe
was
almost
as
honourable
a
way
of
arriving
as
in
one
own
carriage
and
departure
by
the
same
means
had
the
immense
advantage
of
enabling
one
with
a
playful
allusion
to
democratic
principles
to
scramble
into
the
first
brown
conveyance
in
the
line
instead
of
waiting
till
the
congested
nose
of
one
own
coachman
gleamed
under
the
portico
of
the
academy
it
was
one
of
the
great
most
masterly
intuitions
to
have
discovered
that
americans
want
to
get
away
from
amusement
even
more
quickly
than
they
want
to
get
to
it
when
newland
archer
opened
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
club
box
the
curtain
had
just
gone
up
on
the
garden
scene
there
was
no
reason
why
the
young
man
should
not
have
come
earlier
for
he
had
dined
at
seven
alone
with
his
mother
and
sister
and
had
lingered
afterward
over
a
cigar
in
the
gothic
library
with
glazed
bookcases
and
chairs
which
was
the
only
room
in
the
house
where
archer
allowed
smoking
but
in
the
first
place
new
york
was
a
metropolis
and
perfectly
aware
that
in
metropolises
it
was
not
the
thing
to
arrive
early
at
the
opera
and
what
was
or
was
not
the
thing
played
a
part
as
important
in
newland
archer
new
york
as
the
inscrutable
totem
terrors
that
had
ruled
the
destinies
of
his
forefathers
thousands
of
years
ago
the
second
reason
for
his
delay
was
a
personal
one
he
had
dawdled
over
his
cigar
because
he
was
at
heart
a
dilettante
and
thinking
over
a
pleasure
to
come
often
gave
him
a
subtler
satisfaction
than
its
realisation
this
was
especially
the
case
when
the
pleasure
was
a
delicate
one
as
his
pleasures
mostly
were
and
on
this
occasion
the
moment
he
looked
forward
to
was
so
rare
and
exquisite
in
quality
that
well
if
he
had
timed
his
arrival
in
accord
with
the
prima
donna
he
could
not
have
entered
the
academy
at
a
more
significant
moment
than
just
as
she
was
singing
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
not
he
loves
me
and
sprinkling
the
falling
daisy
petals
with
notes
as
clear
as
dew
she
sang
of
course
and
not
he
loves
me
since
an
unalterable
and
unquestioned
law
of
the
musical
world
required
that
the
german
text
of
french
operas
sung
by
swedish
artists
should
be
translated
into
italian
for
the
clearer
understanding
of
audiences
this
seemed
as
natural
to
newland
archer
as
all
the
other
conventions
on
which
his
life
was
moulded
such
as
the
duty
of
using
two
brushes
with
his
monogram
in
blue
enamel
to
part
his
hair
and
of
never
appearing
in
society
without
a
flower
preferably
a
gardenia
in
his
buttonhole
non
the
prima
donna
sang
and
with
a
final
burst
of
love
triumphant
as
she
pressed
the
dishevelled
daisy
to
her
lips
and
lifted
her
large
eyes
to
the
sophisticated
countenance
of
the
little
brown
who
was
vainly
trying
in
a
tight
purple
velvet
doublet
and
plumed
cap
to
look
as
pure
and
true
as
his
artless
victim
newland
archer
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
club
box
turned
his
eyes
from
the
stage
and
scanned
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
directly
facing
him
was
the
box
of
old
manson
mingott
whose
monstrous
obesity
had
long
since
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
attend
the
opera
but
who
was
always
represented
on
fashionable
nights
by
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
family
on
this
occasion
the
front
of
the
box
was
filled
by
her
lovell
mingott
and
her
daughter
welland
and
slightly
withdrawn
behind
these
brocaded
matrons
sat
a
young
girl
in
white
with
eyes
ecstatically
fixed
on
the
stagelovers
as
madame
nilsson
thrilled
out
above
the
silent
house
the
boxes
always
stopped
talking
during
the
daisy
song
a
warm
pink
mounted
to
the
girl
cheek
mantled
her
brow
to
the
roots
of
her
fair
braids
and
suffused
the
young
slope
of
her
breast
to
the
line
where
it
met
a
modest
tulle
tucker
fastened
with
a
single
gardenia
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
immense
bouquet
of
on
her
knee
and
newland
archer
saw
her
touch
the
flowers
softly
he
drew
a
breath
of
satisfied
vanity
and
his
eyes
returned
to
the
stage
no
expense
had
been
spared
on
the
setting
which
was
acknowledged
to
be
very
beautiful
even
by
people
who
shared
his
acquaintance
with
the
opera
houses
of
paris
and
vienna
the
foreground
to
the
footlights
was
covered
with
emerald
green
cloth
in
the
middle
distance
symmetrical
mounds
of
woolly
green
moss
bounded
by
croquet
hoops
formed
the
base
of
shrubs
shaped
like
but
studded
with
large
pink
and
red
roses
gigantic
pansies
considerably
larger
than
the
roses
and
closely
resembling
the
floral
made
by
female
parishioners
for
fashionable
clergymen
sprang
from
the
moss
beneath
the
and
here
and
there
a
daisy
grafted
on
a
flowered
with
a
luxuriance
prophetic
of
luther
burbank
prodigies
in
the
centre
of
this
enchanted
garden
madame
nilsson
in
white
cashmere
slashed
with
pale
blue
satin
a
reticule
dangling
from
a
blue
girdle
and
large
yellow
braids
carefully
disposed
on
each
side
of
her
muslin
chemisette
listened
with
downcast
eyes
to
impassioned
wooing
and
affected
a
guileless
incomprehension
of
his
designs
whenever
by
word
or
glance
he
persuasively
indicated
the
ground
floor
window
of
the
neat
brick
villa
projecting
obliquely
from
the
right
wing
the
darling
thought
newland
archer
his
glance
flitting
back
to
the
young
girl
with
the
she
does
even
guess
what
it
all
about
and
he
contemplated
her
absorbed
young
face
with
a
thrill
of
possessorship
in
which
pride
in
his
own
masculine
initiation
was
mingled
with
a
tender
reverence
for
her
abysmal
purity
read
faust
together
by
the
italian
lakes
he
thought
somewhat
hazily
confusing
the
scene
of
his
projected
with
the
masterpieces
of
literature
which
it
would
be
his
manly
privilege
to
reveal
to
his
bride
it
was
only
that
afternoon
that
may
welland
had
let
him
guess
that
she
cared
new
york
consecrated
phrase
of
maiden
avowal
and
already
his
imagination
leaping
ahead
of
the
engagement
ring
the
betrothal
kiss
and
the
march
from
lohengrin
pictured
her
at
his
side
in
some
scene
of
old
european
witchery
he
did
not
in
the
least
wish
the
future
newland
archer
to
be
a
simpleton
he
meant
her
thanks
to
his
enlightening
companionship
to
develop
a
social
tact
and
readiness
of
wit
enabling
her
to
hold
her
own
with
the
most
popular
married
women
of
the
younger
set
in
which
it
was
the
recognised
custom
to
attract
masculine
homage
while
playfully
discouraging
it
if
he
had
probed
to
the
bottom
of
his
vanity
as
he
sometimes
nearly
did
he
would
have
found
there
the
wish
that
his
wife
should
be
as
and
as
eager
to
please
as
the
married
lady
whose
charms
had
held
his
fancy
through
two
mildly
agitated
years
without
of
course
any
hint
of
the
frailty
which
had
so
nearly
marred
that
unhappy
being
life
and
had
disarranged
his
own
plans
for
a
whole
winter
how
this
miracle
of
fire
and
ice
was
to
be
created
and
to
sustain
itself
in
a
harsh
world
he
had
never
taken
the
time
to
think
out
but
he
was
content
to
hold
his
view
without
analysing
it
since
he
knew
it
was
that
of
all
the
gentlemen
who
succeeded
each
other
in
the
club
box
exchanged
friendly
greetings
with
him
and
turned
their
critically
on
the
circle
of
ladies
who
were
the
product
of
the
system
in
matters
intellectual
and
artistic
newland
archer
felt
himself
distinctly
the
superior
of
these
chosen
specimens
of
old
new
york
gentility
he
had
probably
read
more
thought
more
and
even
seen
a
good
deal
more
of
the
world
than
any
other
man
of
the
number
singly
they
betrayed
their
inferiority
but
grouped
together
they
represented
new
york
and
the
habit
of
masculine
solidarity
made
him
accept
their
doctrine
on
all
the
issues
called
moral
he
instinctively
felt
that
in
this
respect
it
would
be
troublesome
and
also
rather
bad
form
to
strike
out
for
himself
well
upon
my
soul
exclaimed
lawrence
lefferts
turning
his
abruptly
away
from
the
stage
lawrence
lefferts
was
on
the
whole
the
foremost
authority
on
form
in
new
york
he
had
probably
devoted
more
time
than
any
one
else
to
the
study
of
this
intricate
and
fascinating
question
but
study
alone
could
not
account
for
his
complete
and
easy
competence
one
had
only
to
look
at
him
from
the
slant
of
his
bald
forehead
and
the
curve
of
his
beautiful
fair
moustache
to
the
long
feet
at
the
other
end
of
his
lean
and
elegant
person
to
feel
that
the
knowledge
of
form
must
be
congenital
in
any
one
who
knew
how
to
wear
such
good
clothes
so
carelessly
and
carry
such
height
with
so
much
lounging
grace
as
a
young
admirer
had
once
said
of
him
if
anybody
can
tell
a
fellow
just
when
to
wear
a
black
tie
with
evening
clothes
and
when
not
to
larry
lefferts
and
on
the
question
of
pumps
versus
oxfords
his
authority
had
never
been
disputed
my
god
he
said
and
silently
handed
his
glass
to
old
sillerton
jackson
newland
archer
following
lefferts
glance
saw
with
surprise
that
his
exclamation
had
been
occasioned
by
the
entry
of
a
new
figure
into
old
mingott
box
it
was
that
of
a
slim
young
woman
a
little
less
tall
than
may
welland
with
brown
hair
growing
in
close
curls
about
her
temples
and
held
in
place
by
a
narrow
band
of
diamonds
the
suggestion
of
this
headdress
which
gave
her
what
was
then
called
a
josephine
look
was
carried
out
in
the
cut
of
the
dark
blue
velvet
gown
rather
theatrically
caught
up
under
her
bosom
by
a
girdle
with
a
large
clasp
the
wearer
of
this
unusual
dress
who
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
the
attention
it
was
attracting
stood
a
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
box
discussing
with
welland
the
propriety
of
taking
the
latter
place
in
the
front
corner
then
she
yielded
with
a
slight
smile
and
seated
herself
in
line
with
welland
lovell
mingott
who
was
installed
in
the
opposite
corner
sillerton
jackson
had
returned
the
to
lawrence
lefferts
the
whole
of
the
club
turned
instinctively
waiting
to
hear
what
the
old
man
had
to
say
for
old
jackson
was
as
great
an
authority
on
family
as
lawrence
lefferts
was
on
form
he
knew
all
the
ramifications
of
new
york
cousinships
and
could
not
only
elucidate
such
complicated
questions
as
that
of
the
connection
between
the
mingotts
through
the
thorleys
with
the
dallases
of
south
carolina
and
that
of
the
relationship
of
the
elder
branch
of
philadelphia
thorleys
to
the
albany
chiverses
on
no
account
to
be
confused
with
the
manson
chiverses
of
university
place
but
could
also
enumerate
the
leading
characteristics
of
each
family
as
for
instance
the
fabulous
stinginess
of
the
younger
lines
of
leffertses
the
long
island
ones
or
the
fatal
tendency
of
the
rushworths
to
make
foolish
matches
or
the
insanity
recurring
in
every
second
generation
of
the
albany
chiverses
with
whom
their
new
york
cousins
had
always
refused
to
intermarry
with
the
disastrous
exception
of
poor
medora
manson
who
as
everybody
knew
but
then
her
mother
was
a
rushworth
in
addition
to
this
forest
of
family
trees
sillerton
jackson
carried
between
his
narrow
hollow
temples
and
under
his
soft
thatch
of
silver
hair
a
register
of
most
of
the
scandals
and
mysteries
that
had
smouldered
under
the
unruffled
surface
of
new
york
society
within
the
last
fifty
years
so
far
indeed
did
his
information
extend
and
so
acutely
retentive
was
his
memory
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
only
man
who
could
have
told
you
who
julius
beaufort
the
banker
really
was
and
what
had
become
of
handsome
bob
spicer
old
manson
mingott
father
who
had
disappeared
so
mysteriously
with
a
large
sum
of
trust
money
less
than
a
year
after
his
marriage
on
the
very
day
that
a
beautiful
spanish
dancer
who
had
been
delighting
thronged
audiences
in
the
old
on
the
battery
had
taken
ship
for
cuba
but
these
mysteries
and
many
others
were
closely
locked
in
jackson
breast
for
not
only
did
his
keen
sense
of
honour
forbid
his
repeating
anything
privately
imparted
but
he
was
fully
aware
that
his
reputation
for
discretion
increased
his
opportunities
of
finding
out
what
he
wanted
to
know
the
club
box
therefore
waited
in
visible
suspense
while
sillerton
jackson
handed
back
lawrence
lefferts
for
a
moment
he
silently
scrutinised
the
attentive
group
out
of
his
filmy
blue
eyes
overhung
by
old
veined
lids
then
he
gave
his
moustache
a
thoughtful
twist
and
said
simply
i
did
think
the
mingotts
would
have
tried
it
on
ii
newland
archer
during
this
brief
episode
had
been
thrown
into
a
strange
state
of
embarrassment
it
was
annoying
that
the
box
which
was
thus
attracting
the
undivided
attention
of
masculine
new
york
should
be
that
in
which
his
betrothed
was
seated
between
her
mother
and
aunt
and
for
a
moment
he
could
not
identify
the
lady
in
the
empire
dress
nor
imagine
why
her
presence
created
such
excitement
among
the
initiated
then
light
dawned
on
him
and
with
it
came
a
momentary
rush
of
indignation
no
indeed
no
one
would
have
thought
the
mingotts
would
have
tried
it
on
but
they
had
they
undoubtedly
had
for
the
comments
behind
him
left
no
doubt
in
archer
mind
that
the
young
woman
was
may
welland
cousin
the
cousin
always
referred
to
in
the
family
as
poor
ellen
olenska
archer
knew
that
she
had
suddenly
arrived
from
europe
a
day
or
two
previously
he
had
even
heard
from
miss
welland
not
disapprovingly
that
she
had
been
to
see
poor
ellen
who
was
staying
with
old
mingott
archer
entirely
approved
of
family
solidarity
and
one
of
the
qualities
he
most
admired
in
the
mingotts
was
their
resolute
championship
of
the
few
black
sheep
that
their
blameless
stock
had
produced
there
was
nothing
mean
or
ungenerous
in
the
young
heart
and
he
was
glad
that
his
future
wife
should
not
be
restrained
by
false
prudery
from
being
kind
in
private
to
her
unhappy
cousin
but
to
receive
countess
olenska
in
the
family
circle
was
a
different
thing
from
producing
her
in
public
at
the
opera
of
all
places
and
in
the
very
box
with
the
young
girl
whose
engagement
to
him
newland
archer
was
to
be
announced
within
a
few
weeks
no
he
felt
as
old
sillerton
jackson
felt
he
did
not
think
the
mingotts
would
have
tried
it
on
he
knew
of
course
that
whatever
man
dared
within
fifth
limits
that
old
manson
mingott
the
matriarch
of
the
line
would
dare
he
had
always
admired
the
high
and
mighty
old
lady
who
in
spite
of
having
been
only
catherine
spicer
of
staten
island
with
a
father
mysteriously
discredited
and
neither
money
nor
position
enough
to
make
people
forget
it
had
allied
herself
with
the
head
of
the
wealthy
mingott
line
married
two
of
her
daughters
to
foreigners
an
italian
marquis
and
an
english
banker
and
put
the
crowning
touch
to
her
audacities
by
building
a
large
house
of
pale
stone
when
brown
sandstone
seemed
as
much
the
only
wear
as
a
in
the
afternoon
in
an
inaccessible
wilderness
near
the
central
park
old
mingott
foreign
daughters
had
become
a
legend
they
never
came
back
to
see
their
mother
and
the
latter
being
like
many
persons
of
active
mind
and
dominating
will
sedentary
and
corpulent
in
her
habit
had
philosophically
remained
at
home
but
the
house
supposed
to
be
modelled
on
the
private
hotels
of
the
parisian
aristocracy
was
there
as
a
visible
proof
of
her
moral
courage
and
she
throned
in
it
among
furniture
and
souvenirs
of
the
tuileries
of
louis
napoleon
where
she
had
shone
in
her
middle
age
as
placidly
as
if
there
were
nothing
peculiar
in
living
above
street
or
in
having
french
windows
that
opened
like
doors
instead
of
sashes
that
pushed
up
every
one
including
sillerton
jackson
was
agreed
that
old
catherine
had
never
had
beauty
a
gift
which
in
the
eyes
of
new
york
justified
every
success
and
excused
a
certain
number
of
failings
unkind
people
said
that
like
her
imperial
namesake
she
had
won
her
way
to
success
by
strength
of
will
and
hardness
of
heart
and
a
kind
of
haughty
effrontery
that
was
somehow
justified
by
the
extreme
decency
and
dignity
of
her
private
life
manson
mingott
had
died
when
she
was
only
and
had
tied
up
the
money
with
an
additional
caution
born
of
the
general
distrust
of
the
spicers
but
his
bold
young
widow
went
her
way
fearlessly
mingled
freely
in
foreign
society
married
her
daughters
in
heaven
knew
what
corrupt
and
fashionable
circles
hobnobbed
with
dukes
and
ambassadors
associated
familiarly
with
papists
entertained
opera
singers
and
was
the
intimate
friend
of
mme
taglioni
and
all
the
while
as
sillerton
jackson
was
the
first
to
proclaim
there
had
never
been
a
breath
on
her
reputation
the
only
respect
he
always
added
in
which
she
differed
from
the
earlier
catherine
manson
mingott
had
long
since
succeeded
in
untying
her
fortune
and
had
lived
in
affluence
for
half
a
century
but
memories
of
her
early
straits
had
made
her
excessively
thrifty
and
though
when
she
bought
a
dress
or
a
piece
of
furniture
she
took
care
that
it
should
be
of
the
best
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
spend
much
on
the
transient
pleasures
of
the
table
therefore
for
totally
different
reasons
her
food
was
as
poor
as
archer
and
her
wines
did
nothing
to
redeem
it
her
relatives
considered
that
the
penury
of
her
table
discredited
the
mingott
name
which
had
always
been
associated
with
good
living
but
people
continued
to
come
to
her
in
spite
of
the
made
dishes
and
flat
champagne
and
in
reply
to
the
remonstrances
of
her
son
lovell
who
tried
to
retrieve
the
family
credit
by
having
the
best
chef
in
new
york
she
used
to
say
laughingly
what
the
use
of
two
good
cooks
in
one
family
now
that
i
married
the
girls
and
eat
sauces
newland
archer
as
he
mused
on
these
things
had
once
more
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
mingott
box
he
saw
that
welland
and
her
were
facing
their
semicircle
of
critics
with
the
mingottian
aplomb
which
old
catherine
had
inculcated
in
all
her
tribe
and
that
only
may
welland
betrayed
by
a
heightened
colour
perhaps
due
to
the
knowledge
that
he
was
watching
her
a
sense
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
as
for
the
cause
of
the
commotion
she
sat
gracefully
in
her
corner
of
the
box
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
stage
and
revealing
as
she
leaned
forward
a
little
more
shoulder
and
bosom
than
new
york
was
accustomed
to
seeing
at
least
in
ladies
who
had
reasons
for
wishing
to
pass
unnoticed
few
things
seemed
to
newland
archer
more
awful
than
an
offence
against
taste
that
divinity
of
whom
form
was
the
mere
visible
representative
and
vicegerent
madame
olenska
pale
and
serious
face
appealed
to
his
fancy
as
suited
to
the
occasion
and
to
her
unhappy
situation
but
the
way
her
dress
which
had
no
tucker
sloped
away
from
her
thin
shoulders
shocked
and
troubled
him
he
hated
to
think
of
may
welland
being
exposed
to
the
influence
of
a
young
woman
so
careless
of
the
dictates
of
taste
after
all
he
heard
one
of
the
younger
men
begin
behind
him
everybody
talked
through
the
scenes
after
all
just
what
happened
well
she
left
him
nobody
attempts
to
deny
that
he
an
awful
brute
is
he
continued
the
young
enquirer
a
candid
thorley
who
was
evidently
preparing
to
enter
the
lists
as
the
champion
the
very
worst
i
knew
him
at
nice
said
lawrence
lefferts
with
authority
a
white
sneering
fellow
rather
handsome
head
but
eyes
with
a
lot
of
lashes
well
i
tell
you
the
sort
when
he
was
with
women
he
was
collecting
china
paying
any
price
for
both
i
understand
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
the
young
champion
said
well
then
well
then
she
bolted
with
his
secretary
oh
i
see
the
champion
face
fell
it
did
last
long
though
i
heard
of
her
a
few
months
later
living
alone
in
venice
i
believe
lovell
mingott
went
out
to
get
her
he
said
she
was
desperately
unhappy
that
all
right
but
this
parading
her
at
the
opera
another
thing
perhaps
young
thorley
hazarded
she
too
unhappy
to
be
left
at
home
this
was
greeted
with
an
irreverent
laugh
and
the
youth
blushed
deeply
and
tried
to
look
as
if
he
had
meant
to
insinuate
what
knowing
people
called
a
double
entendre
well
it
queer
to
have
brought
miss
welland
anyhow
some
one
said
in
a
low
tone
with
a
at
archer
oh
that
part
of
the
campaign
granny
orders
no
doubt
lefferts
laughed
when
the
old
lady
does
a
thing
she
does
it
thoroughly
the
act
was
ending
and
there
was
a
general
stir
in
the
box
suddenly
newland
archer
felt
himself
impelled
to
decisive
action
the
desire
to
be
the
first
man
to
enter
mingott
box
to
proclaim
to
the
waiting
world
his
engagement
to
may
welland
and
to
see
her
through
whatever
difficulties
her
cousin
anomalous
situation
might
involve
her
in
this
impulse
had
abruptly
overruled
all
scruples
and
hesitations
and
sent
him
hurrying
through
the
red
corridors
to
the
farther
side
of
the
house
as
he
entered
the
box
his
eyes
met
miss
welland
and
he
saw
that
she
had
instantly
understood
his
motive
though
the
family
dignity
which
both
considered
so
high
a
virtue
would
not
permit
her
to
tell
him
so
the
persons
of
their
world
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
faint
implications
and
pale
delicacies
and
the
fact
that
he
and
she
understood
each
other
without
a
word
seemed
to
the
young
man
to
bring
them
nearer
than
any
explanation
would
have
done
her
eyes
said
you
see
why
mamma
brought
me
and
his
answered
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
had
you
stay
away
you
know
my
niece
countess
olenska
welland
enquired
as
she
shook
hands
with
her
future
archer
bowed
without
extending
his
hand
as
was
the
custom
on
being
introduced
to
a
lady
and
ellen
olenska
bent
her
head
slightly
keeping
her
own
hands
clasped
on
her
huge
fan
of
eagle
feathers
having
greeted
lovell
mingott
a
large
blonde
lady
in
creaking
satin
he
sat
down
beside
his
betrothed
and
said
in
a
low
tone
i
hope
you
told
madame
olenska
that
we
engaged
i
want
everybody
to
know
i
want
you
to
let
me
announce
it
this
evening
at
the
ball
miss
welland
face
grew
rosy
as
the
dawn
and
she
looked
at
him
with
radiant
eyes
if
you
can
persuade
mamma
she
said
but
why
should
we
change
what
is
already
settled
he
made
no
answer
but
that
which
his
eyes
returned
and
she
added
still
more
confidently
smiling
tell
my
cousin
yourself
i
give
you
leave
she
says
she
used
to
play
with
you
when
you
were
children
she
made
way
for
him
by
pushing
back
her
chair
and
promptly
and
a
little
ostentatiously
with
the
desire
that
the
whole
house
should
see
what
he
was
doing
archer
seated
himself
at
the
countess
olenska
side
we
did
use
to
play
together
did
we
she
asked
turning
her
grave
eyes
to
his
you
were
a
horrid
boy
and
kissed
me
once
behind
a
door
but
it
was
your
cousin
vandie
newland
who
never
looked
at
me
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
glance
swept
the
curve
of
boxes
ah
how
this
brings
it
all
back
to
me
i
see
everybody
here
in
knickerbockers
and
pantalettes
she
said
with
her
trailing
slightly
foreign
accent
her
eyes
returning
to
his
face
agreeable
as
their
expression
was
the
young
man
was
shocked
that
they
should
reflect
so
unseemly
a
picture
of
the
august
tribunal
before
which
at
that
very
moment
her
case
was
being
tried
nothing
could
be
in
worse
taste
than
misplaced
flippancy
and
he
answered
somewhat
stiffly
yes
you
have
been
away
a
very
long
time
oh
centuries
and
centuries
so
long
she
said
that
i
sure
dead
and
buried
and
this
dear
old
place
is
heaven
which
for
reasons
he
could
not
define
struck
newland
archer
as
an
even
more
disrespectful
way
of
describing
new
york
society
iii
it
invariably
happened
in
the
same
way
julius
beaufort
on
the
night
of
her
annual
ball
never
failed
to
appear
at
the
opera
indeed
she
always
gave
her
ball
on
an
opera
night
in
order
to
emphasise
her
complete
superiority
to
household
cares
and
her
possession
of
a
staff
of
servants
competent
to
organise
every
detail
of
the
entertainment
in
her
absence
the
beauforts
house
was
one
of
the
few
in
new
york
that
possessed
a
it
antedated
even
manson
mingott
and
the
headly
chiverses
and
at
a
time
when
it
was
beginning
to
be
thought
provincial
to
put
a
crash
over
the
floor
and
move
the
furniture
upstairs
the
possession
of
a
that
was
used
for
no
other
purpose
and
left
for
days
of
the
year
to
shuttered
darkness
with
its
gilt
chairs
stacked
in
a
corner
and
its
chandelier
in
a
bag
this
undoubted
superiority
was
felt
to
compensate
for
whatever
was
regrettable
in
the
beaufort
past
archer
who
was
fond
of
coining
her
social
philosophy
into
axioms
had
once
said
we
all
have
our
pet
common
people
and
though
the
phrase
was
a
daring
one
its
truth
was
secretly
admitted
in
many
an
exclusive
bosom
but
the
beauforts
were
not
exactly
common
some
people
said
they
were
even
worse
beaufort
belonged
indeed
to
one
of
america
most
honoured
families
she
had
been
the
lovely
regina
dallas
of
the
south
carolina
branch
a
penniless
beauty
introduced
to
new
york
society
by
her
cousin
the
imprudent
medora
manson
who
was
always
doing
the
wrong
thing
from
the
right
motive
when
one
was
related
to
the
mansons
and
the
rushworths
one
had
a
droit
de
cite
as
sillerton
jackson
who
had
frequented
the
tuileries
called
it
in
new
york
society
but
did
one
not
forfeit
it
in
marrying
julius
beaufort
the
question
was
who
was
beaufort
he
passed
for
an
englishman
was
agreeable
handsome
hospitable
and
witty
he
had
come
to
america
with
letters
of
recommendation
from
old
manson
mingott
english
the
banker
and
had
speedily
made
himself
an
important
position
in
the
world
of
affairs
but
his
habits
were
dissipated
his
tongue
was
bitter
his
antecedents
were
mysterious
and
when
medora
manson
announced
her
cousin
engagement
to
him
it
was
felt
to
be
one
more
act
of
folly
in
poor
medora
long
record
of
imprudences
but
folly
is
as
often
justified
of
her
children
as
wisdom
and
two
years
after
young
beaufort
marriage
it
was
admitted
that
she
had
the
most
distinguished
house
in
new
york
no
one
knew
exactly
how
the
miracle
was
accomplished
she
was
indolent
passive
the
caustic
even
called
her
dull
but
dressed
like
an
idol
hung
with
pearls
growing
younger
and
blonder
and
more
beautiful
each
year
she
throned
in
beaufort
heavy
palace
and
drew
all
the
world
there
without
lifting
her
jewelled
little
finger
the
knowing
people
said
it
was
beaufort
himself
who
trained
the
servants
taught
the
chef
new
dishes
told
the
gardeners
what
flowers
to
grow
for
the
and
the
selected
the
guests
brewed
the
punch
and
dictated
the
little
notes
his
wife
wrote
to
her
friends
if
he
did
these
domestic
activities
were
privately
performed
and
he
presented
to
the
world
the
appearance
of
a
careless
and
hospitable
millionaire
strolling
into
his
own
with
the
detachment
of
an
invited
guest
and
saying
my
wife
gloxinias
are
a
marvel
are
they
i
believe
she
gets
them
out
from
kew
beaufort
secret
people
were
agreed
was
the
way
he
carried
things
off
it
was
all
very
well
to
whisper
that
he
had
been
helped
to
leave
england
by
the
international
in
which
he
had
been
employed
he
carried
off
that
rumour
as
easily
as
the
rest
though
new
york
business
conscience
was
no
less
sensitive
than
its
moral
standard
he
carried
everything
before
him
and
all
new
york
into
his
and
for
over
twenty
years
now
people
had
said
they
were
going
to
the
beauforts
with
the
same
tone
of
security
as
if
they
had
said
they
were
going
to
manson
mingott
and
with
the
added
satisfaction
of
knowing
they
would
get
hot
ducks
and
vintage
wines
instead
of
tepid
veuve
clicquot
without
a
year
and
croquettes
from
philadelphia
beaufort
then
had
as
usual
appeared
in
her
box
just
before
the
jewel
song
and
when
again
as
usual
she
rose
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
drew
her
opera
cloak
about
her
lovely
shoulders
and
disappeared
new
york
knew
that
meant
that
half
an
hour
later
the
ball
would
begin
the
beaufort
house
was
one
that
new
yorkers
were
proud
to
show
to
foreigners
especially
on
the
night
of
the
annual
ball
the
beauforts
had
been
among
the
first
people
in
new
york
to
own
their
own
red
velvet
carpet
and
have
it
rolled
down
the
steps
by
their
own
footmen
under
their
own
awning
instead
of
hiring
it
with
the
supper
and
the
chairs
they
had
also
inaugurated
the
custom
of
letting
the
ladies
take
their
cloaks
off
in
the
hall
instead
of
shuffling
up
to
the
hostess
bedroom
and
recurling
their
hair
with
the
aid
of
the
beaufort
was
understood
to
have
said
that
he
supposed
all
his
wife
friends
had
maids
who
saw
to
it
that
they
were
properly
coiffees
when
they
left
home
then
the
house
had
been
boldly
planned
with
a
so
that
instead
of
squeezing
through
a
narrow
passage
to
get
to
it
as
at
the
chiverses
one
marched
solemnly
down
a
vista
of
enfiladed
the
the
crimson
and
the
bouton
seeing
from
afar
the
lustres
reflected
in
the
polished
parquetry
and
beyond
that
the
depths
of
a
conservatory
where
camellias
and
arched
their
costly
foliage
over
seats
of
black
and
gold
bamboo
newland
archer
as
became
a
young
man
of
his
position
strolled
in
somewhat
late
he
had
left
his
overcoat
with
the
footmen
the
stockings
were
one
of
beaufort
few
fatuities
had
dawdled
a
while
in
the
library
hung
with
spanish
leather
and
furnished
with
buhl
and
malachite
where
a
few
men
were
chatting
and
putting
on
their
and
had
finally
joined
the
line
of
guests
whom
beaufort
was
receiving
on
the
threshold
of
the
crimson
archer
was
distinctly
nervous
he
had
not
gone
back
to
his
club
after
the
opera
as
the
young
bloods
usually
did
but
the
night
being
fine
had
walked
for
some
distance
up
fifth
avenue
before
turning
back
in
the
direction
of
the
beauforts
house
he
was
definitely
afraid
that
the
mingotts
might
be
going
too
far
that
in
fact
they
might
have
granny
mingott
orders
to
bring
the
countess
olenska
to
the
ball
from
the
tone
of
the
club
box
he
had
perceived
how
grave
a
mistake
that
would
be
and
though
he
was
more
than
ever
determined
to
see
the
thing
through
he
felt
less
chivalrously
eager
to
champion
his
betrothed
cousin
than
before
their
brief
talk
at
the
opera
wandering
on
to
the
bouton
where
beaufort
had
had
the
audacity
to
hang
love
victorious
the
nude
of
bouguereau
archer
found
welland
and
her
daughter
standing
near
the
door
couples
were
already
gliding
over
the
floor
beyond
the
light
of
the
wax
candles
fell
on
revolving
tulle
skirts
on
girlish
heads
wreathed
with
modest
blossoms
on
the
dashing
aigrettes
and
ornaments
of
the
young
married
women
coiffures
and
on
the
glitter
of
highly
glazed
and
fresh
glace
gloves
miss
welland
evidently
about
to
join
the
dancers
hung
on
the
threshold
her
in
her
hand
she
carried
no
other
bouquet
her
face
a
little
pale
her
eyes
burning
with
a
candid
excitement
a
group
of
young
men
and
girls
were
gathered
about
her
and
there
was
much
laughing
and
pleasantry
on
which
welland
standing
slightly
apart
shed
the
beam
of
a
qualified
approval
it
was
evident
that
miss
welland
was
in
the
act
of
announcing
her
engagement
while
her
mother
affected
the
air
of
parental
reluctance
considered
suitable
to
the
occasion
archer
paused
a
moment
it
was
at
his
express
wish
that
the
announcement
had
been
made
and
yet
it
was
not
thus
that
he
would
have
wished
to
have
his
happiness
known
to
proclaim
it
in
the
heat
and
noise
of
a
crowded
was
to
rob
it
of
the
fine
bloom
of
privacy
which
should
belong
to
things
nearest
the
heart
his
joy
was
so
deep
that
this
blurring
of
the
surface
left
its
essence
untouched
but
he
would
have
liked
to
keep
the
surface
pure
too
it
was
something
of
a
satisfaction
to
find
that
may
welland
shared
this
feeling
her
eyes
fled
to
his
beseechingly
and
their
look
said
remember
we
doing
this
because
it
right
no
appeal
could
have
found
a
more
immediate
response
in
breast
but
he
wished
that
the
necessity
of
their
action
had
been
represented
by
some
ideal
reason
and
not
simply
by
poor
ellen
olenska
the
group
about
miss
welland
made
way
for
him
with
significant
smiles
and
after
taking
his
share
of
the
felicitations
he
drew
his
betrothed
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
now
we
sha
have
to
talk
he
said
smiling
into
her
candid
eyes
as
they
floated
away
on
the
soft
waves
of
the
blue
danube
she
made
no
answer
her
lips
trembled
into
a
smile
but
the
eyes
remained
distant
and
serious
as
if
bent
on
some
ineffable
vision
dear
archer
whispered
pressing
her
to
him
it
was
borne
in
on
him
that
the
first
hours
of
being
engaged
even
if
spent
in
a
had
in
them
something
grave
and
sacramental
what
a
new
life
it
was
going
to
be
with
this
whiteness
radiance
goodness
at
one
side
the
dance
over
the
two
as
became
an
affianced
couple
wandered
into
the
conservatory
and
sitting
behind
a
tall
screen
of
and
camellias
newland
pressed
her
gloved
hand
to
his
lips
you
see
i
did
as
you
asked
me
to
she
said
yes
i
could
wait
he
answered
smiling
after
a
moment
he
added
only
i
wish
it
had
had
to
be
at
a
ball
yes
i
know
she
met
his
glance
comprehendingly
but
after
all
even
here
we
alone
together
are
we
oh
dearest
always
archer
cried
evidently
she
was
always
going
to
understand
she
was
always
going
to
say
the
right
thing
the
discovery
made
the
cup
of
his
bliss
overflow
and
he
went
on
gaily
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
want
to
kiss
you
and
i
ca
as
he
spoke
he
took
a
swift
glance
about
the
conservatory
assured
himself
of
their
momentary
privacy
and
catching
her
to
him
laid
a
fugitive
pressure
on
her
lips
to
counteract
the
audacity
of
this
proceeding
he
led
her
to
a
bamboo
sofa
in
a
less
secluded
part
of
the
conservatory
and
sitting
down
beside
her
broke
a
from
her
bouquet
she
sat
silent
and
the
world
lay
like
a
sunlit
valley
at
their
feet
did
you
tell
my
cousin
ellen
she
asked
presently
as
if
she
spoke
through
a
dream
he
roused
himself
and
remembered
that
he
had
not
done
so
some
invincible
repugnance
to
speak
of
such
things
to
the
strange
foreign
woman
had
checked
the
words
on
his
lips
no
i
had
the
chance
after
all
he
said
fibbing
hastily
ah
she
looked
disappointed
but
gently
resolved
on
gaining
her
point
you
must
then
for
i
did
either
and
i
should
like
her
to
think
of
course
not
but
are
you
after
all
the
person
to
do
it
she
pondered
on
this
if
i
done
it
at
the
right
time
yes
but
now
that
there
been
a
delay
i
think
you
must
explain
that
i
asked
you
to
tell
her
at
the
opera
before
our
speaking
about
it
to
everybody
here
otherwise
she
might
think
i
had
forgotten
her
you
see
one
of
the
family
and
she
been
away
so
long
that
rather
sensitive
archer
looked
at
her
glowingly
dear
and
great
angel
of
course
tell
her
he
glanced
a
trifle
apprehensively
toward
the
crowded
but
i
have
seen
her
yet
has
she
come
no
at
the
last
minute
she
decided
not
to
at
the
last
minute
he
echoed
betraying
his
surprise
that
she
should
ever
have
considered
the
alternative
possible
yes
she
awfully
fond
of
dancing
the
young
girl
answered
simply
but
suddenly
she
made
up
her
mind
that
her
dress
was
smart
enough
for
a
ball
though
we
thought
it
so
lovely
and
so
my
aunt
had
to
take
her
home
oh
well
said
archer
with
happy
indifference
nothing
about
his
betrothed
pleased
him
more
than
her
resolute
determination
to
carry
to
its
utmost
limit
that
ritual
of
ignoring
the
unpleasant
in
which
they
had
both
been
brought
up
she
knows
as
well
as
i
do
he
reflected
the
real
reason
of
her
cousin
staying
away
but
i
shall
never
let
her
see
by
the
least
sign
that
i
am
conscious
of
there
being
a
shadow
of
a
shade
on
poor
ellen
olenska
reputation
iv
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
the
first
of
the
usual
betrothal
visits
were
exchanged
the
new
york
ritual
was
precise
and
inflexible
in
such
matters
and
in
conformity
with
it
newland
archer
first
went
with
his
mother
and
sister
to
call
on
welland
after
which
he
and
welland
and
may
drove
out
to
old
manson
mingott
to
receive
that
venerable
ancestress
blessing
a
visit
to
manson
mingott
was
always
an
amusing
episode
to
the
young
man
the
house
in
itself
was
already
an
historic
document
though
not
of
course
as
venerable
as
certain
other
old
family
houses
in
university
place
and
lower
fifth
avenue
those
were
of
the
purest
with
a
grim
harmony
of
carpets
rosewood
consoles
with
black
marble
mantels
and
immense
glazed
of
mahogany
whereas
old
mingott
who
had
built
her
house
later
had
bodily
cast
out
the
massive
furniture
of
her
prime
and
mingled
with
the
mingott
heirlooms
the
frivolous
upholstery
of
the
second
empire
it
was
her
habit
to
sit
in
a
window
of
her
on
the
ground
floor
as
if
watching
calmly
for
life
and
fashion
to
flow
northward
to
her
solitary
doors
she
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
have
them
come
for
her
patience
was
equalled
by
her
confidence
she
was
sure
that
presently
the
hoardings
the
quarries
the
saloons
the
wooden
in
ragged
gardens
and
the
rocks
from
which
goats
surveyed
the
scene
would
vanish
before
the
advance
of
residences
as
stately
as
her
own
perhaps
for
she
was
an
impartial
woman
even
statelier
and
that
the
over
which
the
old
clattering
omnibuses
bumped
would
be
replaced
by
smooth
asphalt
such
as
people
reported
having
seen
in
paris
meanwhile
as
every
one
she
cared
to
see
came
to
her
and
she
could
fill
her
rooms
as
easily
as
the
beauforts
and
without
adding
a
single
item
to
the
menu
of
her
suppers
she
did
not
suffer
from
her
geographic
isolation
the
immense
accretion
of
flesh
which
had
descended
on
her
in
middle
life
like
a
flood
of
lava
on
a
doomed
city
had
changed
her
from
a
plump
active
little
woman
with
a
foot
and
ankle
into
something
as
vast
and
august
as
a
natural
phenomenon
she
had
accepted
this
submergence
as
philosophically
as
all
her
other
trials
and
now
in
extreme
old
age
was
rewarded
by
presenting
to
her
mirror
an
almost
unwrinkled
expanse
of
firm
pink
and
white
flesh
in
the
centre
of
which
the
traces
of
a
small
face
survived
as
if
awaiting
excavation
a
flight
of
smooth
double
chins
led
down
to
the
dizzy
depths
of
a
bosom
veiled
in
snowy
muslins
that
were
held
in
place
by
a
miniature
portrait
of
the
late
mingott
and
around
and
below
wave
after
wave
of
black
silk
surged
away
over
the
edges
of
a
capacious
armchair
with
two
tiny
white
hands
poised
like
gulls
on
the
surface
of
the
billows
the
burden
of
manson
mingott
flesh
had
long
since
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
go
up
and
down
stairs
and
with
characteristic
independence
she
had
made
her
reception
rooms
upstairs
and
established
herself
in
flagrant
violation
of
all
the
new
york
proprieties
on
the
ground
floor
of
her
house
so
that
as
you
sat
in
her
window
with
her
you
caught
through
a
door
that
was
always
open
and
a
yellow
damask
portiere
the
unexpected
vista
of
a
bedroom
with
a
huge
low
bed
upholstered
like
a
sofa
and
a
with
frivolous
lace
flounces
and
a
mirror
her
visitors
were
startled
and
fascinated
by
the
foreignness
of
this
arrangement
which
recalled
scenes
in
french
fiction
and
architectural
incentives
to
immorality
such
as
the
simple
american
had
never
dreamed
of
that
was
how
women
with
lovers
lived
in
the
wicked
old
societies
in
apartments
with
all
the
rooms
on
one
floor
and
all
the
indecent
propinquities
that
their
novels
described
it
amused
newland
archer
who
had
secretly
situated
the
of
monsieur
de
camors
in
mingott
bedroom
to
picture
her
blameless
life
led
in
the
of
adultery
but
he
said
to
himself
with
considerable
admiration
that
if
a
lover
had
been
what
she
wanted
the
intrepid
woman
would
have
had
him
too
to
the
general
relief
the
countess
olenska
was
not
present
in
her
grandmother
during
the
visit
of
the
betrothed
couple
mingott
said
she
had
gone
out
which
on
a
day
of
such
glaring
sunlight
and
at
the
shopping
hour
seemed
in
itself
an
indelicate
thing
for
a
compromised
woman
to
do
but
at
any
rate
it
spared
them
the
embarrassment
of
her
presence
and
the
faint
shadow
that
her
unhappy
past
might
seem
to
shed
on
their
radiant
future
the
visit
went
off
successfully
as
was
to
have
been
expected
old
mingott
was
delighted
with
the
engagement
which
being
long
foreseen
by
watchful
relatives
had
been
carefully
passed
upon
in
family
council
and
the
engagement
ring
a
large
thick
sapphire
set
in
invisible
claws
met
with
her
unqualified
admiration
it
the
new
setting
of
course
it
shows
the
stone
beautifully
but
it
looks
a
little
bare
to
eyes
welland
had
explained
with
a
conciliatory
at
her
future
eyes
i
hope
you
do
mean
mine
my
dear
i
like
all
the
novelties
said
the
ancestress
lifting
the
stone
to
her
small
bright
orbs
which
no
glasses
had
ever
disfigured
very
handsome
she
added
returning
the
jewel
very
liberal
in
my
time
a
cameo
set
in
pearls
was
thought
sufficient
but
it
the
hand
that
sets
off
the
ring
is
it
my
dear
mr
archer
and
she
waved
one
of
her
tiny
hands
with
small
pointed
nails
and
rolls
of
aged
fat
encircling
the
wrist
like
ivory
bracelets
mine
was
modelled
in
rome
by
the
great
ferrigiani
you
should
have
may
done
no
doubt
he
have
it
done
my
child
her
hand
is
large
it
these
modern
sports
that
spread
the
joints
but
the
skin
is
and
when
the
wedding
to
be
she
broke
off
fixing
her
eyes
on
archer
face
oh
welland
murmured
while
the
young
man
smiling
at
his
betrothed
replied
as
soon
as
ever
it
can
if
only
you
back
me
up
mrs
mingott
we
must
give
them
time
to
get
to
know
each
other
a
little
better
mamma
welland
interposed
with
the
proper
affectation
of
reluctance
to
which
the
ancestress
rejoined
know
each
other
fiddlesticks
everybody
in
new
york
has
always
known
everybody
let
the
young
man
have
his
way
my
dear
do
wait
till
the
bubble
off
the
wine
marry
them
before
lent
i
may
catch
pneumonia
any
winter
now
and
i
want
to
give
the
these
successive
statements
were
received
with
the
proper
expressions
of
amusement
incredulity
and
gratitude
and
the
visit
was
breaking
up
in
a
vein
of
mild
pleasantry
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
countess
olenska
who
entered
in
bonnet
and
mantle
followed
by
the
unexpected
figure
of
julius
beaufort
there
was
a
cousinly
murmur
of
pleasure
between
the
ladies
and
mingott
held
out
ferrigiani
model
to
the
banker
ha
beaufort
this
is
a
rare
favour
she
had
an
odd
foreign
way
of
addressing
men
by
their
surnames
thanks
i
wish
it
might
happen
oftener
said
the
visitor
in
his
easy
arrogant
way
i
generally
so
tied
down
but
i
met
the
countess
ellen
in
madison
square
and
she
was
good
enough
to
let
me
walk
home
with
her
ah
i
hope
the
house
will
be
gayer
now
that
ellen
here
cried
mingott
with
a
glorious
effrontery
sit
down
sit
down
beaufort
push
up
the
yellow
armchair
now
i
got
you
i
want
a
good
gossip
i
hear
your
ball
was
magnificent
and
i
understand
you
invited
lemuel
struthers
well
i
a
curiosity
to
see
the
woman
myself
she
had
forgotten
her
relatives
who
were
drifting
out
into
the
hall
under
ellen
olenska
guidance
old
mingott
had
always
professed
a
great
admiration
for
julius
beaufort
and
there
was
a
kind
of
kinship
in
their
cool
domineering
way
and
their
through
the
conventions
now
she
was
eagerly
curious
to
know
what
had
decided
the
beauforts
to
invite
for
the
first
time
lemuel
struthers
the
widow
of
struthers
who
had
returned
the
previous
year
from
a
long
initiatory
sojourn
in
europe
to
lay
siege
to
the
tight
little
citadel
of
new
york
of
course
if
you
and
regina
invite
her
the
thing
is
settled
well
we
need
new
blood
and
new
money
and
i
hear
she
still
very
the
carnivorous
old
lady
declared
in
the
hall
while
welland
and
may
drew
on
their
furs
archer
saw
that
the
countess
olenska
was
looking
at
him
with
a
faintly
questioning
smile
of
course
you
know
already
about
may
and
me
he
said
answering
her
look
with
a
shy
laugh
she
scolded
me
for
not
giving
you
the
news
last
night
at
the
opera
i
had
her
orders
to
tell
you
that
we
were
engaged
but
i
could
in
that
crowd
the
smile
passed
from
countess
olenska
eyes
to
her
lips
she
looked
younger
more
like
the
bold
brown
ellen
mingott
of
his
boyhood
of
course
i
know
yes
and
i
so
glad
but
one
does
tell
such
things
first
in
a
crowd
the
ladies
were
on
the
threshold
and
she
held
out
her
hand
come
and
see
me
some
day
she
said
still
looking
at
archer
in
the
carriage
on
the
way
down
fifth
avenue
they
talked
pointedly
of
mingott
of
her
age
her
spirit
and
all
her
wonderful
attributes
no
one
alluded
to
ellen
olenska
but
archer
knew
that
welland
was
thinking
it
a
mistake
for
ellen
to
be
seen
the
very
day
after
her
arrival
parading
up
fifth
avenue
at
the
crowded
hour
with
julius
beaufort
and
the
young
man
himself
mentally
added
and
she
ought
to
know
that
a
man
who
just
engaged
does
spend
his
time
calling
on
married
women
but
i
daresay
in
the
set
she
lived
in
they
do
they
never
do
anything
else
and
in
spite
of
the
cosmopolitan
views
on
which
he
prided
himself
he
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
a
new
yorker
and
about
to
ally
himself
with
one
of
his
own
kind
the
next
evening
old
sillerton
jackson
came
to
dine
with
the
archers
archer
was
a
shy
woman
and
shrank
from
society
but
she
liked
to
be
as
to
its
doings
her
old
friend
sillerton
jackson
applied
to
the
investigation
of
his
friends
affairs
the
patience
of
a
collector
and
the
science
of
a
naturalist
and
his
sister
miss
sophy
jackson
who
lived
with
him
and
was
entertained
by
all
the
people
who
could
not
secure
her
brother
brought
home
bits
of
minor
gossip
that
filled
out
usefully
the
gaps
in
his
picture
therefore
whenever
anything
happened
that
archer
wanted
to
know
about
she
asked
jackson
to
dine
and
as
she
honoured
few
people
with
her
invitations
and
as
she
and
her
daughter
janey
were
an
excellent
audience
jackson
usually
came
himself
instead
of
sending
his
sister
if
he
could
have
dictated
all
the
conditions
he
would
have
chosen
the
evenings
when
newland
was
out
not
because
the
young
man
was
uncongenial
to
him
the
two
got
on
capitally
at
their
club
but
because
the
old
anecdotist
sometimes
felt
on
newland
part
a
tendency
to
weigh
his
evidence
that
the
ladies
of
the
family
never
showed
jackson
if
perfection
had
been
attainable
on
earth
would
also
have
asked
that
archer
food
should
be
a
little
better
but
then
new
york
as
far
back
as
the
mind
of
man
could
travel
had
been
divided
into
the
two
great
fundamental
groups
of
the
mingotts
and
mansons
and
all
their
clan
who
cared
about
eating
and
clothes
and
money
and
the
tribe
who
were
devoted
to
travel
horticulture
and
the
best
fiction
and
looked
down
on
the
grosser
forms
of
pleasure
you
could
have
everything
after
all
if
you
dined
with
the
lovell
mingotts
you
got
and
terrapin
and
vintage
wines
at
adeline
archer
you
could
talk
about
alpine
scenery
and
the
marble
faun
and
luckily
the
archer
madeira
had
gone
round
the
cape
therefore
when
a
friendly
summons
came
from
archer
jackson
who
was
a
true
eclectic
would
usually
say
to
his
sister
i
been
a
little
gouty
since
my
last
dinner
at
the
lovell
mingotts
it
will
do
me
good
to
diet
at
adeline
archer
who
had
long
been
a
widow
lived
with
her
son
and
daughter
in
west
street
an
upper
floor
was
dedicated
to
newland
and
the
two
women
squeezed
themselves
into
narrower
quarters
below
in
an
unclouded
harmony
of
tastes
and
interests
they
cultivated
ferns
in
wardian
cases
made
macrame
lace
and
wool
embroidery
on
linen
collected
american
revolutionary
glazed
ware
subscribed
to
good
words
and
read
ouida
novels
for
the
sake
of
the
italian
atmosphere
they
preferred
those
about
peasant
life
because
of
the
descriptions
of
scenery
and
the
pleasanter
sentiments
though
in
general
they
liked
novels
about
people
in
society
whose
motives
and
habits
were
more
comprehensible
spoke
severely
of
dickens
who
had
never
drawn
a
gentleman
and
considered
thackeray
less
at
home
in
the
great
world
than
bulwer
who
however
was
beginning
to
be
thought
and
miss
archer
were
both
great
lovers
of
scenery
it
was
what
they
principally
sought
and
admired
on
their
occasional
travels
abroad
considering
architecture
and
painting
as
subjects
for
men
and
chiefly
for
learned
persons
who
read
ruskin
archer
had
been
born
a
newland
and
mother
and
daughter
who
were
as
like
as
sisters
were
both
as
people
said
true
newlands
tall
pale
and
slightly
with
long
noses
sweet
smiles
and
a
kind
of
drooping
distinction
like
that
in
certain
faded
reynolds
portraits
their
physical
resemblance
would
have
been
complete
if
an
elderly
embonpoint
had
not
stretched
archer
black
brocade
while
miss
brown
and
purple
poplins
hung
as
the
years
went
on
more
and
more
slackly
on
her
virgin
frame
mentally
the
likeness
between
them
as
newland
was
aware
was
less
complete
than
their
identical
mannerisms
often
made
it
appear
the
long
habit
of
living
together
in
mutually
dependent
intimacy
had
given
them
the
same
vocabulary
and
the
same
habit
of
beginning
their
phrases
mother
thinks
or
janey
thinks
according
as
one
or
the
other
wished
to
advance
an
opinion
of
her
own
but
in
reality
while
serene
unimaginativeness
rested
easily
in
the
accepted
and
familiar
janey
was
subject
to
starts
and
aberrations
of
fancy
welling
up
from
springs
of
suppressed
romance
mother
and
daughter
adored
each
other
and
revered
their
son
and
brother
and
archer
loved
them
with
a
tenderness
made
compunctious
and
uncritical
by
the
sense
of
their
exaggerated
admiration
and
by
his
secret
satisfaction
in
it
after
all
he
thought
it
a
good
thing
for
a
man
to
have
his
authority
respected
in
his
own
house
even
if
his
sense
of
humour
sometimes
made
him
question
the
force
of
his
mandate
on
this
occasion
the
young
man
was
very
sure
that
jackson
would
rather
have
had
him
dine
out
but
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
not
doing
so
of
course
old
jackson
wanted
to
talk
about
ellen
olenska
and
of
course
archer
and
janey
wanted
to
hear
what
he
had
to
tell
all
three
would
be
slightly
embarrassed
by
newland
presence
now
that
his
prospective
relation
to
the
mingott
clan
had
been
made
known
and
the
young
man
waited
with
an
amused
curiosity
to
see
how
they
would
turn
the
difficulty
they
began
obliquely
by
talking
about
lemuel
struthers
it
a
pity
the
beauforts
asked
her
archer
said
gently
but
then
regina
always
does
what
he
tells
her
and
beaufort
certain
nuances
escape
beaufort
said
jackson
cautiously
inspecting
the
broiled
shad
and
wondering
for
the
thousandth
time
why
archer
cook
always
burnt
the
roe
to
a
cinder
newland
who
had
long
shared
his
wonder
could
always
detect
it
in
the
older
expression
of
melancholy
disapproval
oh
necessarily
beaufort
is
a
vulgar
man
said
archer
my
grandfather
newland
always
used
to
say
to
my
mother
you
do
do
let
that
fellow
beaufort
be
introduced
to
the
girls
but
at
least
he
had
the
advantage
of
associating
with
gentlemen
in
england
too
they
say
it
all
very
mysterious
she
glanced
at
janey
and
paused
she
and
janey
knew
every
fold
of
the
beaufort
mystery
but
in
public
archer
continued
to
assume
that
the
subject
was
not
one
for
the
unmarried
but
this
struthers
archer
continued
what
did
you
say
she
was
sillerton
out
of
a
mine
or
rather
out
of
the
saloon
at
the
head
of
the
pit
then
with
living
touring
new
england
after
the
police
broke
that
up
they
say
she
lived
jackson
in
his
turn
glanced
at
janey
whose
eyes
began
to
bulge
from
under
her
prominent
lids
there
were
still
hiatuses
for
her
in
struthers
past
then
jackson
continued
and
archer
saw
he
was
wondering
why
no
one
had
told
the
butler
never
to
slice
cucumbers
with
a
steel
knife
then
lemuel
struthers
came
along
they
say
his
advertiser
used
the
girl
head
for
the
posters
her
hair
intensely
black
you
know
the
egyptian
style
anyhow
he
eventually
married
her
there
were
volumes
of
innuendo
in
the
way
the
eventually
was
spaced
and
each
syllable
given
its
due
stress
oh
well
at
the
pass
we
come
to
nowadays
it
does
matter
said
archer
indifferently
the
ladies
were
not
really
interested
in
struthers
just
then
the
subject
of
ellen
olenska
was
too
fresh
and
too
absorbing
to
them
indeed
struthers
name
had
been
introduced
by
archer
only
that
she
might
presently
be
able
to
say
and
newland
new
cousin
countess
olenska
was
she
at
the
ball
too
there
was
a
faint
touch
of
sarcasm
in
the
reference
to
her
son
and
archer
knew
it
and
had
expected
it
even
archer
who
was
seldom
unduly
pleased
with
human
events
had
been
altogether
glad
of
her
engagement
especially
after
that
silly
business
with
rushworth
as
she
had
remarked
to
janey
alluding
to
what
had
once
seemed
to
newland
a
tragedy
of
which
his
soul
would
always
bear
the
scar
there
was
no
better
match
in
new
york
than
may
welland
look
at
the
question
from
whatever
point
you
chose
of
course
such
a
marriage
was
only
what
newland
was
entitled
to
but
young
men
are
so
foolish
and
incalculable
and
some
women
so
ensnaring
and
unscrupulous
that
it
was
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
to
see
one
only
son
safe
past
the
siren
isle
and
in
the
haven
of
a
blameless
domesticity
all
this
archer
felt
and
her
son
knew
she
felt
but
he
knew
also
that
she
had
been
perturbed
by
the
premature
announcement
of
his
engagement
or
rather
by
its
cause
and
it
was
for
that
reason
because
on
the
whole
he
was
a
tender
and
indulgent
master
that
he
had
stayed
at
home
that
evening
it
not
that
i
do
approve
of
the
esprit
de
corps
but
why
newland
engagement
should
be
mixed
up
with
that
olenska
woman
comings
and
goings
i
do
see
archer
grumbled
to
janey
the
only
witness
of
her
slight
lapses
from
perfect
sweetness
she
had
behaved
beautifully
and
in
beautiful
behaviour
she
was
unsurpassed
during
the
call
on
welland
but
newland
knew
and
his
betrothed
doubtless
guessed
that
all
through
the
visit
she
and
janey
were
nervously
on
the
watch
for
madame
olenska
possible
intrusion
and
when
they
left
the
house
together
she
had
permitted
herself
to
say
to
her
son
i
thankful
that
augusta
welland
received
us
alone
these
indications
of
inward
disturbance
moved
archer
the
more
that
he
too
felt
that
the
mingotts
had
gone
a
little
too
far
but
as
it
was
against
all
the
rules
of
their
code
that
the
mother
and
son
should
ever
allude
to
what
was
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
he
simply
replied
oh
well
there
always
a
phase
of
family
parties
to
be
gone
through
when
one
gets
engaged
and
the
sooner
it
over
the
better
at
which
his
mother
merely
pursed
her
lips
under
the
lace
veil
that
hung
down
from
her
grey
velvet
bonnet
trimmed
with
frosted
grapes
her
revenge
he
felt
her
lawful
revenge
would
be
to
draw
jackson
that
evening
on
the
countess
olenska
and
having
publicly
done
his
duty
as
a
future
member
of
the
mingott
clan
the
young
man
had
no
objection
to
hearing
the
lady
discussed
in
private
except
that
the
subject
was
already
beginning
to
bore
him
jackson
had
helped
himself
to
a
slice
of
the
tepid
filet
which
the
mournful
butler
had
handed
him
with
a
look
as
sceptical
as
his
own
and
had
rejected
the
mushroom
sauce
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
sniff
he
looked
baffled
and
hungry
and
archer
reflected
that
he
would
probably
finish
his
meal
on
ellen
olenska
jackson
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
glanced
up
at
the
candlelit
archers
newlands
and
van
der
luydens
hanging
in
dark
frames
on
the
dark
walls
ah
how
your
grandfather
archer
loved
a
good
dinner
my
dear
newland
he
said
his
eyes
on
the
portrait
of
a
plump
young
man
in
a
stock
and
a
blue
coat
with
a
view
of
a
behind
him
well
well
well
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
said
to
all
these
foreign
marriages
archer
ignored
the
allusion
to
the
ancestral
cuisine
and
jackson
continued
with
deliberation
no
she
was
not
at
the
ball
ah
archer
murmured
in
a
tone
that
implied
she
had
that
decency
perhaps
the
beauforts
do
know
her
janey
suggested
with
her
artless
malice
jackson
gave
a
faint
sip
as
if
he
had
been
tasting
invisible
madeira
beaufort
may
not
but
beaufort
certainly
does
for
she
was
seen
walking
up
fifth
avenue
this
afternoon
with
him
by
the
whole
of
new
york
mercy
moaned
archer
evidently
perceiving
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
ascribe
the
actions
of
foreigners
to
a
sense
of
delicacy
i
wonder
if
she
wears
a
round
hat
or
a
bonnet
in
the
afternoon
janey
speculated
at
the
opera
i
know
she
had
on
dark
blue
velvet
perfectly
plain
and
flat
like
a
janey
said
her
mother
and
miss
archer
blushed
and
tried
to
look
audacious
it
was
at
any
rate
in
better
taste
not
to
go
to
the
ball
archer
continued
a
spirit
of
perversity
moved
her
son
to
rejoin
i
do
think
it
was
a
question
of
taste
with
her
may
said
she
meant
to
go
and
then
decided
that
the
dress
in
question
was
smart
enough
archer
smiled
at
this
confirmation
of
her
inference
poor
ellen
she
simply
remarked
adding
compassionately
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
what
an
eccentric
medora
manson
gave
her
what
can
you
expect
of
a
girl
who
was
allowed
to
wear
black
satin
at
her
ball
ah
do
i
remember
her
in
it
said
jackson
adding
poor
girl
in
the
tone
of
one
who
while
enjoying
the
memory
had
fully
understood
at
the
time
what
the
sight
portended
it
odd
janey
remarked
that
she
should
have
kept
such
an
ugly
name
as
ellen
i
should
have
changed
it
to
elaine
she
glanced
about
the
table
to
see
the
effect
of
this
her
brother
laughed
why
elaine
i
do
know
it
sounds
more
more
polish
said
janey
blushing
it
sounds
more
conspicuous
and
that
can
hardly
be
what
she
wishes
said
archer
distantly
why
not
broke
in
her
son
growing
suddenly
argumentative
why
should
she
be
conspicuous
if
she
chooses
why
should
she
slink
about
as
if
it
were
she
who
had
disgraced
herself
she
certainly
because
she
had
the
bad
luck
to
make
a
wretched
marriage
but
i
do
see
that
that
a
reason
for
hiding
her
head
as
if
she
were
the
culprit
that
i
suppose
said
jackson
speculatively
is
the
line
the
mingotts
mean
to
take
the
young
man
reddened
i
did
have
to
wait
for
their
cue
if
that
what
you
mean
sir
madame
olenska
has
had
an
unhappy
life
that
does
make
her
an
outcast
there
are
rumours
began
jackson
glancing
at
janey
oh
i
know
the
secretary
the
young
man
took
him
up
nonsense
mother
janey
they
say
do
they
he
went
on
that
the
secretary
helped
her
to
get
away
from
her
brute
of
a
husband
who
kept
her
practically
a
prisoner
well
what
if
he
did
i
hope
there
a
man
among
us
who
would
have
done
the
same
in
such
a
case
jackson
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
say
to
the
sad
butler
perhaps
that
sauce
just
a
little
after
all
then
having
helped
himself
he
remarked
i
told
she
looking
for
a
house
she
means
to
live
here
i
hear
she
means
to
get
a
divorce
said
janey
boldly
i
hope
she
will
archer
exclaimed
the
word
had
fallen
like
a
bombshell
in
the
pure
and
tranquil
atmosphere
of
the
archer
archer
raised
her
delicate
in
the
particular
curve
that
signified
the
butler
and
the
young
man
himself
mindful
of
the
bad
taste
of
discussing
such
intimate
matters
in
public
hastily
branched
off
into
an
account
of
his
visit
to
old
mingott
after
dinner
according
to
immemorial
custom
archer
and
janey
trailed
their
long
silk
draperies
up
to
the
where
while
the
gentlemen
smoked
below
stairs
they
sat
beside
a
carcel
lamp
with
an
engraved
globe
facing
each
other
across
a
rosewood
with
a
green
silk
bag
under
it
and
stitched
at
the
two
ends
of
a
tapestry
band
of
destined
to
adorn
an
occasional
chair
in
the
of
young
newland
archer
while
this
rite
was
in
progress
in
the
archer
settled
jackson
in
an
armchair
near
the
fire
in
the
gothic
library
and
handed
him
a
cigar
jackson
sank
into
the
armchair
with
satisfaction
lit
his
cigar
with
perfect
confidence
it
was
newland
who
bought
them
and
stretching
his
thin
old
ankles
to
the
coals
said
you
say
the
secretary
merely
helped
her
to
get
away
my
dear
fellow
well
he
was
still
helping
her
a
year
later
then
for
somebody
met
living
at
lausanne
together
newland
reddened
living
together
well
why
not
who
had
the
right
to
make
her
life
over
if
she
had
i
sick
of
the
hypocrisy
that
would
bury
alive
a
woman
of
her
age
if
her
husband
prefers
to
live
with
harlots
he
stopped
and
turned
away
angrily
to
light
his
cigar
women
ought
to
be
free
as
free
as
we
are
he
declared
making
a
discovery
of
which
he
was
too
irritated
to
measure
the
terrific
consequences
sillerton
jackson
stretched
his
ankles
nearer
the
coals
and
emitted
a
sardonic
whistle
well
he
said
after
a
pause
apparently
count
olenski
takes
your
view
for
i
never
heard
of
his
having
lifted
a
finger
to
get
his
wife
back
vi
that
evening
after
jackson
had
taken
himself
away
and
the
ladies
had
retired
to
their
bedroom
newland
archer
mounted
thoughtfully
to
his
own
study
a
vigilant
hand
had
as
usual
kept
the
fire
alive
and
the
lamp
trimmed
and
the
room
with
its
rows
and
rows
of
books
its
bronze
and
steel
statuettes
of
the
fencers
on
the
mantelpiece
and
its
many
photographs
of
famous
pictures
looked
singularly
and
welcoming
as
he
dropped
into
his
armchair
near
the
fire
his
eyes
rested
on
a
large
photograph
of
may
welland
which
the
young
girl
had
given
him
in
the
first
days
of
their
romance
and
which
had
now
displaced
all
the
other
portraits
on
the
table
with
a
new
sense
of
awe
he
looked
at
the
frank
forehead
serious
eyes
and
gay
innocent
mouth
of
the
young
creature
whose
soul
custodian
he
was
to
be
that
terrifying
product
of
the
social
system
he
belonged
to
and
believed
in
the
young
girl
who
knew
nothing
and
expected
everything
looked
back
at
him
like
a
stranger
through
may
welland
familiar
features
and
once
more
it
was
borne
in
on
him
that
marriage
was
not
the
safe
anchorage
he
had
been
taught
to
think
but
a
voyage
on
uncharted
seas
the
case
of
the
countess
olenska
had
stirred
up
old
settled
convictions
and
set
them
drifting
dangerously
through
his
mind
his
own
exclamation
women
should
be
free
as
free
as
we
are
struck
to
the
root
of
a
problem
that
it
was
agreed
in
his
world
to
regard
as
nice
women
however
wronged
would
never
claim
the
kind
of
freedom
he
meant
and
men
like
himself
were
therefore
in
the
heat
of
argument
the
more
chivalrously
ready
to
concede
it
to
them
such
verbal
generosities
were
in
fact
only
a
humbugging
disguise
of
the
inexorable
conventions
that
tied
things
together
and
bound
people
down
to
the
old
pattern
but
here
he
was
pledged
to
defend
on
the
part
of
his
betrothed
cousin
conduct
that
on
his
own
wife
part
would
justify
him
in
calling
down
on
her
all
the
thunders
of
church
and
state
of
course
the
dilemma
was
purely
hypothetical
since
he
was
a
blackguard
polish
nobleman
it
was
absurd
to
speculate
what
his
wife
rights
would
be
if
he
were
but
newland
archer
was
too
imaginative
not
to
feel
that
in
his
case
and
may
the
tie
might
gall
for
reasons
far
less
gross
and
palpable
what
could
he
and
she
really
know
of
each
other
since
it
was
his
duty
as
a
decent
fellow
to
conceal
his
past
from
her
and
hers
as
a
marriageable
girl
to
have
no
past
to
conceal
what
if
for
some
one
of
the
subtler
reasons
that
would
tell
with
both
of
them
they
should
tire
of
each
other
misunderstand
or
irritate
each
other
he
reviewed
his
friends
marriages
the
supposedly
happy
ones
and
saw
none
that
answered
even
remotely
to
the
passionate
and
tender
comradeship
which
he
pictured
as
his
permanent
relation
with
may
welland
he
perceived
that
such
a
picture
presupposed
on
her
part
the
experience
the
versatility
the
freedom
of
judgment
which
she
had
been
carefully
trained
not
to
possess
and
with
a
shiver
of
foreboding
he
saw
his
marriage
becoming
what
most
of
the
other
marriages
about
him
were
a
dull
association
of
material
and
social
interests
held
together
by
ignorance
on
the
one
side
and
hypocrisy
on
the
other
lawrence
lefferts
occurred
to
him
as
the
husband
who
had
most
completely
realised
this
enviable
ideal
as
became
the
of
form
he
had
formed
a
wife
so
completely
to
his
own
convenience
that
in
the
most
conspicuous
moments
of
his
frequent
with
other
wives
she
went
about
in
smiling
unconsciousness
saying
that
lawrence
was
so
frightfully
strict
and
had
been
known
to
blush
indignantly
and
avert
her
gaze
when
some
one
alluded
in
her
presence
to
the
fact
that
julius
beaufort
as
became
a
foreigner
of
doubtful
origin
had
what
was
known
in
new
york
as
another
establishment
archer
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
not
quite
such
an
ass
as
larry
lefferts
nor
may
such
a
simpleton
as
poor
gertrude
but
the
difference
was
after
all
one
of
intelligence
and
not
of
standards
in
reality
they
all
lived
in
a
kind
of
hieroglyphic
world
where
the
real
thing
was
never
said
or
done
or
even
thought
but
only
represented
by
a
set
of
arbitrary
signs
as
when
welland
who
knew
exactly
why
archer
had
pressed
her
to
announce
her
engagement
at
the
beaufort
ball
and
had
indeed
expected
him
to
do
no
less
yet
felt
obliged
to
simulate
reluctance
and
the
air
of
having
had
her
hand
forced
quite
as
in
the
books
on
primitive
man
that
people
of
advanced
culture
were
beginning
to
read
the
savage
bride
is
dragged
with
shrieks
from
her
parents
tent
the
result
of
course
was
that
the
young
girl
who
was
the
centre
of
this
elaborate
system
of
mystification
remained
the
more
inscrutable
for
her
very
frankness
and
assurance
she
was
frank
poor
darling
because
she
had
nothing
to
conceal
assured
because
she
knew
of
nothing
to
be
on
her
guard
against
and
with
no
better
preparation
than
this
she
was
to
be
plunged
overnight
into
what
people
evasively
called
the
facts
of
life
the
young
man
was
sincerely
but
placidly
in
love
he
delighted
in
the
radiant
good
looks
of
his
betrothed
in
her
health
her
horsemanship
her
grace
and
quickness
at
games
and
the
shy
interest
in
books
and
ideas
that
she
was
beginning
to
develop
under
his
guidance
she
had
advanced
far
enough
to
join
him
in
ridiculing
the
idyls
of
the
king
but
not
to
feel
the
beauty
of
ulysses
and
the
lotus
eaters
she
was
straightforward
loyal
and
brave
she
had
a
sense
of
humour
chiefly
proved
by
her
laughing
at
his
jokes
and
he
suspected
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
a
glow
of
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
joy
to
waken
but
when
he
had
gone
the
brief
round
of
her
he
returned
discouraged
by
the
thought
that
all
this
frankness
and
innocence
were
only
an
artificial
product
untrained
human
nature
was
not
frank
and
innocent
it
was
full
of
the
twists
and
defences
of
an
instinctive
guile
and
he
felt
himself
oppressed
by
this
creation
of
factitious
purity
so
cunningly
manufactured
by
a
conspiracy
of
mothers
and
aunts
and
grandmothers
and
ancestresses
because
it
was
supposed
to
be
what
he
wanted
what
he
had
a
right
to
in
order
that
he
might
exercise
his
lordly
pleasure
in
smashing
it
like
an
image
made
of
snow
there
was
a
certain
triteness
in
these
reflections
they
were
those
habitual
to
young
men
on
the
approach
of
their
wedding
day
but
they
were
generally
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
compunction
and
of
which
newland
archer
felt
no
trace
he
could
not
deplore
as
thackeray
heroes
so
often
exasperated
him
by
doing
that
he
had
not
a
blank
page
to
offer
his
bride
in
exchange
for
the
unblemished
one
she
was
to
give
to
him
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
fact
that
if
he
had
been
brought
up
as
she
had
they
would
have
been
no
more
fit
to
find
their
way
about
than
the
babes
in
the
wood
nor
could
he
for
all
his
anxious
cogitations
see
any
honest
reason
any
that
is
unconnected
with
his
own
momentary
pleasure
and
the
passion
of
masculine
vanity
why
his
bride
should
not
have
been
allowed
the
same
freedom
of
experience
as
himself
such
questions
at
such
an
hour
were
bound
to
drift
through
his
mind
but
he
was
conscious
that
their
uncomfortable
persistence
and
precision
were
due
to
the
inopportune
arrival
of
the
countess
olenska
here
he
was
at
the
very
moment
of
his
betrothal
a
moment
for
pure
thoughts
and
cloudless
hopes
pitchforked
into
a
coil
of
scandal
which
raised
all
the
special
problems
he
would
have
preferred
to
let
lie
hang
ellen
olenska
he
grumbled
as
he
covered
his
fire
and
began
to
undress
he
could
not
really
see
why
her
fate
should
have
the
least
bearing
on
his
yet
he
dimly
felt
that
he
had
only
just
begun
to
measure
the
risks
of
the
championship
which
his
engagement
had
forced
upon
him
a
few
days
later
the
bolt
fell
the
lovell
mingotts
had
sent
out
cards
for
what
was
known
as
a
formal
dinner
that
is
three
extra
footmen
two
dishes
for
each
course
and
a
roman
punch
in
the
middle
and
had
headed
their
invitations
with
the
words
to
meet
the
countess
olenska
in
accordance
with
the
hospitable
american
fashion
which
treats
strangers
as
if
they
were
royalties
or
at
least
as
their
ambassadors
the
guests
had
been
selected
with
a
boldness
and
discrimination
in
which
the
initiated
recognised
the
firm
hand
of
catherine
the
great
associated
with
such
immemorial
standbys
as
the
selfridge
merrys
who
were
asked
everywhere
because
they
always
had
been
the
beauforts
on
whom
there
was
a
claim
of
relationship
and
sillerton
jackson
and
his
sister
sophy
who
went
wherever
her
brother
told
her
to
were
some
of
the
most
fashionable
and
yet
most
irreproachable
of
the
dominant
young
married
set
the
lawrence
leffertses
lefferts
rushworth
the
lovely
widow
the
harry
thorleys
the
reggie
chiverses
and
young
morris
dagonet
and
his
wife
who
was
a
van
der
luyden
the
company
indeed
was
perfectly
assorted
since
all
the
members
belonged
to
the
little
inner
group
of
people
who
during
the
long
new
york
season
disported
themselves
together
daily
and
nightly
with
apparently
undiminished
zest
hours
later
the
unbelievable
had
happened
every
one
had
refused
the
mingotts
invitation
except
the
beauforts
and
old
jackson
and
his
sister
the
intended
slight
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
even
the
reggie
chiverses
who
were
of
the
mingott
clan
were
among
those
inflicting
it
and
by
the
uniform
wording
of
the
notes
in
all
of
which
the
writers
regretted
that
they
were
unable
to
accept
without
the
mitigating
plea
of
a
previous
engagement
that
ordinary
courtesy
prescribed
new
york
society
was
in
those
days
far
too
small
and
too
scant
in
its
resources
for
every
one
in
it
including
butlers
and
cooks
not
to
know
exactly
on
which
evenings
people
were
free
and
it
was
thus
possible
for
the
recipients
of
lovell
mingott
invitations
to
make
cruelly
clear
their
determination
not
to
meet
the
countess
olenska
the
blow
was
unexpected
but
the
mingotts
as
their
way
was
met
it
gallantly
lovell
mingott
confided
the
case
to
welland
who
confided
it
to
newland
archer
who
aflame
at
the
outrage
appealed
passionately
and
authoritatively
to
his
mother
who
after
a
painful
period
of
inward
resistance
and
outward
temporising
succumbed
to
his
instances
as
she
always
did
and
immediately
embracing
his
cause
with
an
energy
redoubled
by
her
previous
hesitations
put
on
her
grey
velvet
bonnet
and
said
i
go
and
see
louisa
van
der
luyden
the
new
york
of
newland
archer
day
was
a
small
and
slippery
pyramid
in
which
as
yet
hardly
a
fissure
had
been
made
or
a
foothold
gained
at
its
base
was
a
firm
foundation
of
what
archer
called
plain
people
an
honourable
but
obscure
majority
of
respectable
families
who
as
in
the
case
of
the
spicers
or
the
leffertses
or
the
jacksons
had
been
raised
above
their
level
by
marriage
with
one
of
the
ruling
clans
people
archer
always
said
were
not
as
particular
as
they
used
to
be
and
with
old
catherine
spicer
ruling
one
end
of
fifth
avenue
and
julius
beaufort
the
other
you
could
expect
the
old
traditions
to
last
much
longer
firmly
narrowing
upward
from
this
wealthy
but
inconspicuous
substratum
was
the
compact
and
dominant
group
which
the
mingotts
newlands
chiverses
and
mansons
so
actively
represented
most
people
imagined
them
to
be
the
very
apex
of
the
pyramid
but
they
themselves
at
least
those
of
archer
generation
were
aware
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
professional
genealogist
only
a
still
smaller
number
of
families
could
lay
claim
to
that
eminence
do
tell
me
archer
would
say
to
her
children
all
this
modern
newspaper
rubbish
about
a
new
york
aristocracy
if
there
is
one
neither
the
mingotts
nor
the
mansons
belong
to
it
no
nor
the
newlands
or
the
chiverses
either
our
grandfathers
and
were
just
respectable
english
or
dutch
merchants
who
came
to
the
colonies
to
make
their
fortune
and
stayed
here
because
they
did
so
well
one
of
your
signed
the
declaration
and
another
was
a
general
on
washington
staff
and
received
general
burgoyne
sword
after
the
battle
of
saratoga
these
are
things
to
be
proud
of
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
rank
or
class
new
york
has
always
been
a
commercial
community
and
there
are
not
more
than
three
families
in
it
who
can
claim
an
aristocratic
origin
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
archer
and
her
son
and
daughter
like
every
one
else
in
new
york
knew
who
these
privileged
beings
were
the
dagonets
of
washington
square
who
came
of
an
old
english
county
family
allied
with
the
pitts
and
foxes
the
lannings
who
had
intermarried
with
the
descendants
of
count
de
grasse
and
the
van
der
luydens
direct
descendants
of
the
first
dutch
governor
of
manhattan
and
related
by
marriages
to
several
members
of
the
french
and
british
aristocracy
the
lannings
survived
only
in
the
person
of
two
very
old
but
lively
miss
lannings
who
lived
cheerfully
and
reminiscently
among
family
portraits
and
chippendale
the
dagonets
were
a
considerable
clan
allied
to
the
best
names
in
baltimore
and
philadelphia
but
the
van
der
luydens
who
stood
above
all
of
them
had
faded
into
a
kind
of
twilight
from
which
only
two
figures
impressively
emerged
those
of
and
henry
van
der
luyden
henry
van
der
luyden
had
been
louisa
dagonet
and
her
mother
had
been
the
granddaughter
of
colonel
du
lac
of
an
old
channel
island
family
who
had
fought
under
cornwallis
and
had
settled
in
maryland
after
the
war
with
his
bride
lady
angelica
trevenna
fifth
daughter
of
the
earl
of
austrey
the
tie
between
the
dagonets
the
du
lacs
of
maryland
and
their
aristocratic
cornish
kinsfolk
the
trevennas
had
always
remained
close
and
cordial
and
van
der
luyden
had
more
than
once
paid
long
visits
to
the
present
head
of
the
house
of
trevenna
the
duke
of
austrey
at
his
in
cornwall
and
at
austrey
in
gloucestershire
and
his
grace
had
frequently
announced
his
intention
of
some
day
returning
their
visit
without
the
duchess
who
feared
the
atlantic
and
van
der
luyden
divided
their
time
between
trevenna
their
place
in
maryland
and
skuytercliff
the
great
estate
on
the
hudson
which
had
been
one
of
the
colonial
grants
of
the
dutch
government
to
the
famous
first
governor
and
of
which
van

was
still
patroon

large
solemn
house
in
madison
avenue
was
seldom
opened
and
when
they
came
to
town
they
received
in
it
only
their
most
intimate
friends
i
wish
you
would
go
with
me
newland
his
mother
said
suddenly
pausing
at
the
door
of
the
brown
coupe
louisa
is
fond
of
you
and
of
course
it
on
account
of
dear
may
that
i

this
step
and
also
because
if
we
do
all
stand
together
there
be
no
such
thing
as
society
left
vii
henry
van
der
luyden
listened
in
silence
to
her
cousin
archer
narrative
it
was
all
very
well
to
tell
yourself
in
advance
that
van
der
luyden
was
always
silent
and
that
though
by
nature
and
training
she
was
very
kind
to
the
people
she
really
liked
even
personal
experience
of
these
facts
was
not
always
a
protection
from
the
chill
that
descended
on
one
in
the
madison
avenue
with
the
pale
brocaded
armchairs
so
obviously
uncovered
for
the
occasion
and
the
gauze
still
veiling
the
ormolu
mantel
ornaments
and
the
beautiful
old
carved
frame
of
lady
angelica
du
lac
van
der
luyden
portrait
by
huntington
in
black
velvet
and
venetian
point
faced
that
of
her
lovely
ancestress
it
was
generally
considered
as
fine
as
a
cabanel
and
though
twenty
years
had
elapsed
since
its
execution
was
still
a
perfect
likeness
indeed
the
van
der
luyden
who
sat
beneath
it
listening
to
archer
might
have
been
the
of
the
fair
and
still
youngish
woman
drooping
against
a
gilt
armchair
before
a
green
rep
curtain
van
der
luyden
still
wore
black
velvet
and
venetian
point
when
she
went
into
society
or
rather
since
she
never
dined
out
when
she
threw
open
her
own
doors
to
receive
it
her
fair
hair
which
had
faded
without
turning
grey
was
still
parted
in
flat
overlapping
points
on
her
forehead
and
the
straight
nose
that
divided
her
pale
blue
eyes
was
only
a
little
more
pinched
about
the
nostrils
than
when
the
portrait
had
been
painted
she
always
indeed
struck
newland
archer
as
having
been
rather
gruesomely
preserved
in
the
airless
atmosphere
of
a
perfectly
irreproachable
existence
as
bodies
caught
in
glaciers
keep
for
years
a
rosy
like
all
his
family
he
esteemed
and
admired
van
der
luyden
but
he
found
her
gentle
bending
sweetness
less
approachable
than
the
grimness
of
some
of
his
mother
old
aunts
fierce
spinsters
who
said
no
on
principle
before
they
knew
what
they
were
going
to
be
asked
van
der
luyden
attitude
said
neither
yes
nor
no
but
always
appeared
to
incline
to
clemency
till
her
thin
lips
wavering
into
the
shadow
of
a
smile
made
the
almost
invariable
reply
i
shall
first
have
to
talk
this
over
with
my
husband
she
and
van
der
luyden
were
so
exactly
alike
that
archer
often
wondered
how
after
forty
years
of
the
closest
conjugality
two
such
merged
identities
ever
separated
themselves
enough
for
anything
as
controversial
as
a
but
as
neither
had
ever
reached
a
decision
without
prefacing
it
by
this
mysterious
conclave
archer
and
her
son
having
set
forth
their
case
waited
resignedly
for
the
familiar
phrase
van
der
luyden
however
who
had
seldom
surprised
any
one
now
surprised
them
by
reaching
her
long
hand
toward
the
i
think
she
said
i
should
like
henry
to
hear
what
you
have
told
me
a
footman
appeared
to
whom
she
gravely
added
if
van
der
luyden
has
finished
reading
the
newspaper
please
ask
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
come
she
said
reading
the
newspaper
in
the
tone
in
which
a
minister
wife
might
have
said
presiding
at
a
cabinet
meeting
not
from
any
arrogance
of
mind
but
because
the
habit
of
a
and
the
attitude
of
her
friends
and
relations
had
led
her
to
consider
van
der
luyden
least
gesture
as
having
an
almost
sacerdotal
importance
her
promptness
of
action
showed
that
she
considered
the
case
as
pressing
as
archer
but
lest
she
should
be
thought
to
have
committed
herself
in
advance
she
added
with
the
sweetest
look
henry
always
enjoys
seeing
you
dear
adeline
and
he
will
wish
to
congratulate
newland
the
double
doors
had
solemnly
reopened
and
between
them
appeared
henry
van
der
luyden
tall
spare
and
with
faded
fair
hair
a
straight
nose
like
his
wife
and
the
same
look
of
frozen
gentleness
in
eyes
that
were
merely
pale
grey
instead
of
pale
blue
van
der
luyden
greeted
archer
with
cousinly
affability
proffered
to
newland
congratulations
couched
in
the
same
language
as
his
wife
and
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
brocade
armchairs
with
the
simplicity
of
a
reigning
sovereign
i
had
just
finished
reading
the
times
he
said
laying
his
long
together
in
town
my
mornings
are
so
much
occupied
that
i
find
it
more
convenient
to
read
the
newspapers
after
luncheon
ah
there
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that
plan
indeed
i
think
my
uncle
egmont
used
to
say
he
found
it
less
agitating
not
to
read
the
morning
papers
till
after
dinner
said
archer
responsively
yes
my
good
father
abhorred
hurry
but
now
we
live
in
a
constant
rush
said
van
der
luyden
in
measured
tones
looking
with
pleasant
deliberation
about
the
large
shrouded
room
which
to
archer
was
so
complete
an
image
of
its
owners
but
i
hope
you
had
finished
your
reading
henry
his
wife
interposed
quite
quite
he
reassured
her
then
i
should
like
adeline
to
tell
you
oh
it
really
newland
story
said
his
mother
smiling
and
proceeded
to
rehearse
once
more
the
monstrous
tale
of
the
affront
inflicted
on
lovell
mingott
of
course
she
ended
augusta
welland
and
mary
mingott
both
felt
that
especially
in
view
of
newland
engagement
you
and
henry
ought
to
know
ah
said
van
der
luyden
drawing
a
deep
breath
there
was
a
silence
during
which
the
tick
of
the
monumental
ormolu
clock
on
the
white
marble
mantelpiece
grew
as
loud
as
the
boom
of
a
archer
contemplated
with
awe
the
two
slender
faded
figures
seated
side
by
side
in
a
kind
of
viceregal
rigidity
mouthpieces
of
some
remote
ancestral
authority
which
fate
compelled
them
to
wield
when
they
would
so
much
rather
have
lived
in
simplicity
and
seclusion
digging
invisible
weeds
out
of
the
perfect
lawns
of
skuytercliff
and
playing
patience
together
in
the
evenings
van
der
luyden
was
the
first
to
speak
you
really
think
this
is
due
to
some
some
intentional
interference
of
lawrence
lefferts
he
enquired
turning
to
archer
i
certain
of
it
sir
larry
has
been
going
it
rather
harder
than
usual
lately
if
cousin
louisa
wo
mind
my
mentioning
it
having
rather
a
stiff
affair
with
the
postmaster
wife
in
their
village
or
some
one
of
that
sort
and
whenever
poor
gertrude
lefferts
begins
to
suspect
anything
and
he
afraid
of
trouble
he
gets
up
a
fuss
of
this
kind
to
show
how
awfully
moral
he
is
and
talks
at
the
top
of
his
voice
about
the
impertinence
of
inviting
his
wife
to
meet
people
he
does
wish
her
to
know
he
simply
using
madame
olenska
as
a
i
seen
him
try
the
same
thing
often
before
the
leffertses
said
van
der
luyden
the
leffertses
echoed
archer
what
would
uncle
egmont
have
said
of
lawrence
lefferts
pronouncing
on
anybody
social
position
it
shows
what
society
has
come
to
we
hope
it
has
not
quite
come
to
that
said
van
der
luyden
firmly
ah
if
only
you
and
louisa
went
out
more
sighed
archer
but
instantly
she
became
aware
of
her
mistake
the
van
der
luydens
were
morbidly
sensitive
to
any
criticism
of
their
secluded
existence
they
were
the
arbiters
of
fashion
the
court
of
last
appeal
and
they
knew
it
and
bowed
to
their
fate
but
being
shy
and
retiring
persons
with
no
natural
inclination
for
their
part
they
lived
as
much
as
possible
in
the
sylvan
solitude
of
skuytercliff
and
when
they
came
to
town
declined
all
invitations
on
the
plea
of
van
der
health
newland
archer
came
to
his
mother
rescue
everybody
in
new
york
knows
what
you
and
cousin
louisa
represent
that
why
mingott
felt
she
ought
not
to
allow
this
slight
on
countess
olenska
to
pass
without
consulting
you
van
der
luyden
glanced
at
her
husband
who
glanced
back
at
her
it
is
the
principle
that
i
dislike
said
van
der
luyden
as
long
as
a
member
of
a
family
is
backed
up
by
that
family
it
should
be
considered
final
it
seems
so
to
me
said
his
wife
as
if
she
were
producing
a
new
thought
i
had
no
idea
van
der
luyden
continued
that
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
he
paused
and
looked
at
his
wife
again
it
occurs
to
me
my
dear
that
the
countess
olenska
is
already
a
sort
of
relation
through
medora
manson
first
husband
at
any
rate
she
will
be
when
newland
marries
he
turned
toward
the
young
man
have
you
read
this
morning
times
newland
why
yes
sir
said
archer
who
usually
tossed
off
half
a
dozen
papers
with
his
morning
coffee
husband
and
wife
looked
at
each
other
again
their
pale
eyes
clung
together
in
prolonged
and
serious
consultation
then
a
faint
smile
fluttered
over
van
der
luyden
face
she
had
evidently
guessed
and
approved
van
der
luyden
turned
to
archer
if
louisa
health
allowed
her
to
dine
out
i
wish
you
would
say
to
lovell
mingott
she
and
i
would
have
been
happy
to
er
fill
the
places
of
the
lawrence
leffertses
at
her
dinner
he
paused
to
let
the
irony
of
this
sink
in
as
you
know
this
is
impossible
archer
sounded
a
sympathetic
assent
but
newland
tells
me
he
has
read
this
morning
times
therefore
he
has
probably
seen
that
louisa
relative
the
duke
of
austrey
arrives
next
week
on
the
russia
he
is
coming
to
enter
his
new
sloop
the
guinevere
in
next
summer
international
cup
race
and
also
to
have
a
little
canvasback
shooting
at
trevenna
van
der
luyden
paused
again
and
continued
with
increasing
benevolence
before
taking
him
down
to
maryland
we
are
inviting
a
few
friends
to
meet
him
here
only
a
little
dinner
with
a
reception
afterward
i
am
sure
louisa
will
be
as
glad
as
i
am
if
countess
olenska
will
let
us
include
her
among
our
guests
he
got
up
bent
his
long
body
with
a
stiff
friendliness
toward
his
cousin
and
added
i
think
i
have
louisa
authority
for
saying
that
she
will
herself
leave
the
invitation
to
dine
when
she
drives
out
presently
with
our
cards
of
course
with
our
cards
archer
who
knew
this
to
be
a
hint
that
the
chestnuts
which
were
never
kept
waiting
were
at
the
door
rose
with
a
hurried
murmur
of
thanks
van
der
luyden
beamed
on
her
with
the
smile
of
esther
interceding
with
ahasuerus
but
her
husband
raised
a
protesting
hand
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for
dear
adeline
nothing
whatever
this
kind
of
thing
must
not
happen
in
new
york
it
shall
not
as
long
as
i
can
help
it
he
pronounced
with
sovereign
gentleness
as
he
steered
his
cousins
to
the
door
two
hours
later
every
one
knew
that
the
great
barouche
in
which
van
der
luyden
took
the
air
at
all
seasons
had
been
seen
at
old
mingott
door
where
a
large
square
envelope
was
handed
in
and
that
evening
at
the
opera
sillerton
jackson
was
able
to
state
that
the
envelope
contained
a
card
inviting
the
countess
olenska
to
the
dinner
which
the
van
der
luydens
were
giving
the
following
week
for
their
cousin
the
duke
of
austrey
some
of
the
younger
men
in
the
club
box
exchanged
a
smile
at
this
announcement
and
glanced
sideways
at
lawrence
lefferts
who
sat
carelessly
in
the
front
of
the
box
pulling
his
long
fair
moustache
and
who
remarked
with
authority
as
the
soprano
paused
no
one
but
patti
ought
to
attempt
the
sonnambula
viii
it
was
generally
agreed
in
new
york
that
the
countess
olenska
had
lost
her
looks
she
had
appeared
there
first
in
newland
archer
boyhood
as
a
brilliantly
pretty
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
of
whom
people
said
that
she
ought
to
be
painted
her
parents
had
been
continental
wanderers
and
after
a
roaming
babyhood
she
had
lost
them
both
and
been
taken
in
charge
by
her
aunt
medora
manson
also
a
wanderer
who
was
herself
returning
to
new
york
to
settle
down
poor
medora
repeatedly
widowed
was
always
coming
home
to
settle
down
each
time
in
a
less
expensive
house
and
bringing
with
her
a
new
husband
or
an
adopted
child
but
after
a
few
months
she
invariably
parted
from
her
husband
or
quarrelled
with
her
ward
and
having
got
rid
of
her
house
at
a
loss
set
out
again
on
her
wanderings
as
her
mother
had
been
a
rushworth
and
her
last
unhappy
marriage
had
linked
her
to
one
of
the
crazy
chiverses
new
york
looked
indulgently
on
her
eccentricities
but
when
she
returned
with
her
little
orphaned
niece
whose
parents
had
been
popular
in
spite
of
their
regrettable
taste
for
travel
people
thought
it
a
pity
that
the
pretty
child
should
be
in
such
hands
every
one
was
disposed
to
be
kind
to
little
ellen
mingott
though
her
dusky
red
cheeks
and
tight
curls
gave
her
an
air
of
gaiety
that
seemed
unsuitable
in
a
child
who
should
still
have
been
in
black
for
her
parents
it
was
one
of
the
misguided
medora
many
peculiarities
to
flout
the
unalterable
rules
that
regulated
american
mourning
and
when
she
stepped
from
the
steamer
her
family
were
scandalised
to
see
that
the
crape
veil
she
wore
for
her
own
brother
was
seven
inches
shorter
than
those
of
her
while
little
ellen
was
in
crimson
merino
and
amber
beads
like
a
gipsy
foundling
but
new
york
had
so
long
resigned
itself
to
medora
that
only
a
few
old
ladies
shook
their
heads
over
ellen
gaudy
clothes
while
her
other
relations
fell
under
the
charm
of
her
high
colour
and
high
spirits
she
was
a
fearless
and
familiar
little
thing
who
asked
disconcerting
questions
made
precocious
comments
and
possessed
outlandish
arts
such
as
dancing
a
spanish
shawl
dance
and
singing
neapolitan
to
a
guitar
under
the
direction
of
her
aunt
whose
real
name
was
thorley
chivers
but
who
having
received
a
papal
title
had
resumed
her
first
husband
patronymic
and
called
herself
the
marchioness
manson
because
in
italy
she
could
turn
it
into
manzoni
the
little
girl
received
an
expensive
but
incoherent
education
which
included
drawing
from
the
model
a
thing
never
dreamed
of
before
and
playing
the
piano
in
quintets
with
professional
musicians
of
course
no
good
could
come
of
this
and
when
a
few
years
later
poor
chivers
finally
died
in
a
madhouse
his
widow
draped
in
strange
weeds
again
pulled
up
stakes
and
departed
with
ellen
who
had
grown
into
a
tall
bony
girl
with
conspicuous
eyes
for
some
time
no
more
was
heard
of
them
then
news
came
of
ellen
marriage
to
an
immensely
rich
polish
nobleman
of
legendary
fame
whom
she
had
met
at
a
ball
at
the
tuileries
and
who
was
said
to
have
princely
establishments
in
paris
nice
and
florence
a
yacht
at
cowes
and
many
square
miles
of
shooting
in
transylvania
she
disappeared
in
a
kind
of
sulphurous
apotheosis
and
when
a
few
years
later
medora
again
came
back
to
new
york
subdued
impoverished
mourning
a
third
husband
and
in
quest
of
a
still
smaller
house
people
wondered
that
her
rich
niece
had
not
been
able
to
do
something
for
her
then
came
the
news
that
ellen
own
marriage
had
ended
in
disaster
and
that
she
was
herself
returning
home
to
seek
rest
and
oblivion
among
her
kinsfolk
these
things
passed
through
newland
archer
mind
a
week
later
as
he
watched
the
countess
olenska
enter
the
van
der
luyden
on
the
evening
of
the
momentous
dinner
the
occasion
was
a
solemn
one
and
he
wondered
a
little
nervously
how
she
would
carry
it
off
she
came
rather
late
one
hand
still
ungloved
and
fastening
a
bracelet
about
her
wrist
yet
she
entered
without
any
appearance
of
haste
or
embarrassment
the
in
which
new
york
most
chosen
company
was
somewhat
awfully
assembled
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
paused
looking
about
her
with
a
grave
mouth
and
smiling
eyes
and
in
that
instant
newland
archer
rejected
the
general
verdict
on
her
looks
it
was
true
that
her
early
radiance
was
gone
the
red
cheeks
had
paled
she
was
thin
worn
a
little
than
her
age
which
must
have
been
nearly
thirty
but
there
was
about
her
the
mysterious
authority
of
beauty
a
sureness
in
the
carriage
of
the
head
the
movement
of
the
eyes
which
without
being
in
the
least
theatrical
struck
his
as
highly
trained
and
full
of
a
conscious
power
at
the
same
time
she
was
simpler
in
manner
than
most
of
the
ladies
present
and
many
people
as
he
heard
afterward
from
janey
were
disappointed
that
her
appearance
was
not
more
stylish
for
stylishness
was
what
new
york
most
valued
it
was
perhaps
archer
reflected
because
her
early
vivacity
had
disappeared
because
she
was
so
quiet
quiet
in
her
movements
her
voice
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
new
york
had
expected
something
a
good
deal
more
reasonant
in
a
young
woman
with
such
a
history
the
dinner
was
a
somewhat
formidable
business
dining
with
the
van
der
luydens
was
at
best
no
light
matter
and
dining
there
with
a
duke
who
was
their
cousin
was
almost
a
religious
solemnity
it
pleased
archer
to
think
that
only
an
old
new
yorker
could
perceive
the
shade
of
difference
to
new
york
between
being
merely
a
duke
and
being
the
van
der
luydens
duke
new
york
took
stray
noblemen
calmly
and
even
except
in
the
struthers
set
with
a
certain
distrustful
hauteur
but
when
they
presented
such
credentials
as
these
they
were
received
with
an
cordiality
that
they
would
have
been
greatly
mistaken
in
ascribing
solely
to
their
standing
in
debrett
it
was
for
just
such
distinctions
that
the
young
man
cherished
his
old
new
york
even
while
he
smiled
at
it
the
van
der
luydens
had
done
their
best
to
emphasise
the
importance
of
the
occasion
the
du
lac
sevres
and
the
trevenna
george
ii
plate
were
out
so
was
the
van
der
luyden
lowestoft
east
india
company
and
the
dagonet
crown
derby
van
der
luyden
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
cabanel
and
archer
in
her
grandmother
and
emeralds
reminded
her
son
of
an
isabey
miniature
all
the
ladies
had
on
their
handsomest
jewels
but
it
was
characteristic
of
the
house
and
the
occasion
that
these
were
mostly
in
rather
heavy
settings
and
old
miss
lanning
who
had
been
persuaded
to
come
actually
wore
her
mother
cameos
and
a
spanish
blonde
shawl
the
countess
olenska
was
the
only
young
woman
at
the
dinner
yet
as
archer
scanned
the
smooth
plump
elderly
faces
between
their
diamond
necklaces
and
towering
ostrich
feathers
they
struck
him
as
curiously
immature
compared
with
hers
it
frightened
him
to
think
what
must
have
gone
to
the
making
of
her
eyes
the
duke
of
austrey
who
sat
at
his
hostess
right
was
naturally
the
chief
figure
of
the
evening
but
if
the
countess
olenska
was
less
conspicuous
than
had
been
hoped
the
duke
was
almost
invisible
being
a
man
he
had
not
like
another
recent
ducal
visitor
come
to
the
dinner
in
a
but
his
evening
clothes
were
so
shabby
and
baggy
and
he
wore
them
with
such
an
air
of
their
being
homespun
that
with
his
stooping
way
of
sitting
and
the
vast
beard
spreading
over
his
he
hardly
gave
the
appearance
of
being
in
dinner
attire
he
was
short
sunburnt
with
a
thick
nose
small
eyes
and
a
sociable
smile
but
he
seldom
spoke
and
when
he
did
it
was
in
such
low
tones
that
despite
the
frequent
silences
of
expectation
about
the
table
his
remarks
were
lost
to
all
but
his
neighbours
when
the
men
joined
the
ladies
after
dinner
the
duke
went
straight
up
to
the
countess
olenska
and
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
plunged
into
animated
talk
neither
seemed
aware
that
the
duke
should
first
have
paid
his
respects
to
lovell
mingott
and
headly
chivers
and
the
countess
have
conversed
with
that
amiable
hypochondriac
urban
dagonet
of
washington
square
who
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
had
broken
through
his
fixed
rule
of
not
dining
out
between
january
and
april
the
two
chatted
together
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
then
the
countess
rose
and
walking
alone
across
the
wide
sat
down
at
newland
archer
side
it
was
not
the
custom
in
new
york
for
a
lady
to
get
up
and
walk
away
from
one
gentleman
in
order
to
seek
the
company
of
another
etiquette
required
that
she
should
wait
immovable
as
an
idol
while
the
men
who
wished
to
converse
with
her
succeeded
each
other
at
her
side
but
the
countess
was
apparently
unaware
of
having
broken
any
rule
she
sat
at
perfect
ease
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
beside
archer
and
looked
at
him
with
the
kindest
eyes
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
about
may
she
said
instead
of
answering
her
he
asked
you
knew
the
duke
before
oh
yes
we
used
to
see
him
every
winter
at
nice
he
very
fond
of
gambling
he
used
to
come
to
the
house
a
great
deal
she
said
it
in
the
simplest
manner
as
if
she
had
said
he
fond
of
and
after
a
moment
she
added
candidly
i
think
he
the
dullest
man
i
ever
met
this
pleased
her
companion
so
much
that
he
forgot
the
slight
shock
her
previous
remark
had
caused
him
it
was
undeniably
exciting
to
meet
a
lady
who
found
the
van
der
luydens
duke
dull
and
dared
to
utter
the
opinion
he
longed
to
question
her
to
hear
more
about
the
life
of
which
her
careless
words
had
given
him
so
illuminating
a
glimpse
but
he
feared
to
touch
on
distressing
memories
and
before
he
could
think
of
anything
to
say
she
had
strayed
back
to
her
original
subject
may
is
a
darling
i
seen
no
young
girl
in
new
york
so
handsome
and
so
intelligent
are
you
very
much
in
love
with
her
newland
archer
reddened
and
laughed
as
much
as
a
man
can
be
she
continued
to
consider
him
thoughtfully
as
if
not
to
miss
any
shade
of
meaning
in
what
he
said
do
you
think
then
there
is
a
limit
to
being
in
love
if
there
is
i
have
found
it
she
glowed
with
sympathy
ah
it
really
and
truly
a
romance
the
most
romantic
of
romances
how
delightful
and
you
found
it
all
out
for
yourselves
it
was
not
in
the
least
arranged
for
you
archer
looked
at
her
incredulously
have
you
forgotten
he
asked
with
a
smile
that
in
our
country
we
do
allow
our
marriages
to
be
arranged
for
us
a
dusky
blush
rose
to
her
cheek
and
he
instantly
regretted
his
words
yes
she
answered
i
forgotten
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
sometimes
make
these
mistakes
i
do
always
remember
that
everything
here
is
good
that
was
that
was
bad
where
i
come
from
she
looked
down
at
her
viennese
fan
of
eagle
feathers
and
he
saw
that
her
lips
trembled
i
so
sorry
he
said
impulsively
but
you
are
among
friends
here
you
know
yes
i
know
wherever
i
go
i
have
that
feeling
that
why
i
came
home
i
want
to
forget
everything
else
to
become
a
complete
american
again
like
the
mingotts
and
wellands
and
you
and
your
delightful
mother
and
all
the
other
good
people
here
tonight
ah
here
may
arriving
and
you
will
want
to
hurry
away
to
her
she
added
but
without
moving
and
her
eyes
turned
back
from
the
door
to
rest
on
the
young
man
face
the
were
beginning
to
fill
up
with
guests
and
following
madame
olenska
glance
archer
saw
may
welland
entering
with
her
mother
in
her
dress
of
white
and
silver
with
a
wreath
of
silver
blossoms
in
her
hair
the
tall
girl
looked
like
a
diana
just
alight
from
the
chase
oh
said
archer
i
have
so
many
rivals
you
see
she
already
surrounded
there
the
duke
being
introduced
then
stay
with
me
a
little
longer
madame
olenska
said
in
a
low
tone
just
touching
his
knee
with
her
plumed
fan
it
was
the
lightest
touch
but
it
thrilled
him
like
a
caress
yes
let
me
stay
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
but
just
then
van
der
luyden
came
up
followed
by
old
urban
dagonet
the
countess
greeted
them
with
her
grave
smile
and
archer
feeling
his
host
admonitory
glance
on
him
rose
and
surrendered
his
seat
madame
olenska
held
out
her
hand
as
if
to
bid
him
goodbye
tomorrow
then
after
five
i
shall
expect
you
she
said
and
then
turned
back
to
make
room
for
dagonet
tomorrow
archer
heard
himself
repeating
though
there
had
been
no
engagement
and
during
their
talk
she
had
given
him
no
hint
that
she
wished
to
see
him
again
as
he
moved
away
he
saw
lawrence
lefferts
tall
and
resplendent
leading
his
wife
up
to
be
introduced
and
heard
gertrude
lefferts
say
as
she
beamed
on
the
countess
with
her
large
unperceiving
smile
but
i
think
we
used
to
go
to
together
when
we
were
children
behind
her
waiting
their
turn
to
name
themselves
to
the
countess
archer
noticed
a
number
of
the
recalcitrant
couples
who
had
declined
to
meet
her
at
lovell
mingott
as
archer
remarked
when
the
van
der
luydens
chose
they
knew
how
to
give
a
lesson
the
wonder
was
that
they
chose
so
seldom
the
young
man
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
and
saw
van
der
luyden
looking
down
on
him
from
the
pure
eminence
of
black
velvet
and
the
family
diamonds
it
was
good
of
you
dear
newland
to
devote
yourself
so
unselfishly
to
madame
olenska
i
told
your
cousin
henry
he
must
really
come
to
the
rescue
he
was
aware
of
smiling
at
her
vaguely
and
she
added
as
if
condescending
to
his
natural
shyness
i
never
seen
may
looking
lovelier
the
duke
thinks
her
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
room
ix
the
countess
olenska
had
said
after
five
and
at
half
after
the
hour
newland
archer
rang
the
bell
of
the
peeling
stucco
house
with
a
giant
wisteria
throttling
its
feeble
balcony
which
she
had
hired
far
down
west
street
from
the
vagabond
medora
it
was
certainly
a
strange
quarter
to
have
settled
in
small
and
people
who
wrote
were
her
nearest
neighbours
and
further
down
the
dishevelled
street
archer
recognised
a
dilapidated
wooden
house
at
the
end
of
a
paved
path
in
which
a
writer
and
journalist
called
winsett
whom
he
used
to
come
across
now
and
then
had
mentioned
that
he
lived
winsett
did
not
invite
people
to
his
house
but
he
had
once
pointed
it
out
to
archer
in
the
course
of
a
nocturnal
stroll
and
the
latter
had
asked
himself
with
a
little
shiver
if
the
humanities
were
so
meanly
housed
in
other
capitals
madame
olenska
own
dwelling
was
redeemed
from
the
same
appearance
only
by
a
little
more
paint
about
the
and
as
archer
mustered
its
modest
front
he
said
to
himself
that
the
polish
count
must
have
robbed
her
of
her
fortune
as
well
as
of
her
illusions
the
young
man
had
spent
an
unsatisfactory
day
he
had
lunched
with
the
wellands
hoping
afterward
to
carry
off
may
for
a
walk
in
the
park
he
wanted
to
have
her
to
himself
to
tell
her
how
enchanting
she
had
looked
the
night
before
and
how
proud
he
was
of
her
and
to
press
her
to
hasten
their
marriage
but
welland
had
firmly
reminded
him
that
the
round
of
family
visits
was
not
half
over
and
when
he
hinted
at
advancing
the
date
of
the
wedding
had
raised
reproachful
and
sighed
out
twelve
dozen
of
everything
packed
in
the
family
landau
they
rolled
from
one
tribal
doorstep
to
another
and
archer
when
the
afternoon
round
was
over
parted
from
his
betrothed
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
been
shown
off
like
a
wild
animal
cunningly
trapped
he
supposed
that
his
readings
in
anthropology
caused
him
to
take
such
a
coarse
view
of
what
was
after
all
a
simple
and
natural
demonstration
of
family
feeling
but
when
he
remembered
that
the
wellands
did
not
expect
the
wedding
to
take
place
till
the
following
autumn
and
pictured
what
his
life
would
be
till
then
a
dampness
fell
upon
his
spirit
tomorrow
welland
called
after
him
we
do
the
chiverses
and
the
dallases
and
he
perceived
that
she
was
going
through
their
two
families
alphabetically
and
that
they
were
only
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
alphabet
he
had
meant
to
tell
may
of
the
countess
olenska
request
her
command
rather
that
he
should
call
on
her
that
afternoon
but
in
the
brief
moments
when
they
were
alone
he
had
had
more
pressing
things
to
say
besides
it
struck
him
as
a
little
absurd
to
allude
to
the
matter
he
knew
that
may
most
particularly
wanted
him
to
be
kind
to
her
cousin
was
it
not
that
wish
which
had
hastened
the
announcement
of
their
engagement
it
gave
him
an
odd
sensation
to
reflect
that
but
for
the
countess
arrival
he
might
have
been
if
not
still
a
free
man
at
least
a
man
less
irrevocably
pledged
but
may
had
willed
it
so
and
he
felt
himself
somehow
relieved
of
further
responsibility
and
therefore
at
liberty
if
he
chose
to
call
on
her
cousin
without
telling
her
as
he
stood
on
madame
olenska
threshold
curiosity
was
his
uppermost
feeling
he
was
puzzled
by
the
tone
in
which
she
had
summoned
him
he
concluded
that
she
was
less
simple
than
she
seemed
the
door
was
opened
by
a
swarthy
maid
with
a
prominent
bosom
under
a
gay
neckerchief
whom
he
vaguely
fancied
to
be
sicilian
she
welcomed
him
with
all
her
white
teeth
and
answering
his
enquiries
by
a
of
incomprehension
led
him
through
the
narrow
hall
into
a
low
firelit
the
room
was
empty
and
she
left
him
for
an
appreciable
time
to
wonder
whether
she
had
gone
to
find
her
mistress
or
whether
she
had
not
understood
what
he
was
there
for
and
thought
it
might
be
to
wind
the
clock
of
which
he
perceived
that
the
only
visible
specimen
had
stopped
he
knew
that
the
southern
races
communicated
with
each
other
in
the
language
of
pantomime
and
was
mortified
to
find
her
shrugs
and
smiles
so
unintelligible
at
length
she
returned
with
a
lamp
and
archer
having
meanwhile
put
together
a
phrase
out
of
dante
and
petrarch
evoked
the
answer
la
signora
e
fuori
ma
verra
subito
which
he
took
to
mean
she
out
but
soon
see
what
he
saw
meanwhile
with
the
help
of
the
lamp
was
the
faded
shadowy
charm
of
a
room
unlike
any
room
he
had
known
he
knew
that
the
countess
olenska
had
brought
some
of
her
possessions
with
her
bits
of
wreckage
she
called
them
and
these
he
supposed
were
represented
by
some
small
slender
tables
of
dark
wood
a
delicate
little
greek
bronze
on
the
and
a
stretch
of
red
damask
nailed
on
the
discoloured
wallpaper
behind
a
couple
of
pictures
in
old
frames
newland
archer
prided
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
italian
art
his
boyhood
had
been
saturated
with
ruskin
and
he
had
read
all
the
latest
books
john
addington
symonds
vernon
lee
euphorion
the
essays
of
hamerton
and
a
wonderful
new
volume
called
the
renaissance
by
walter
pater
he
talked
easily
of
botticelli
and
spoke
of
fra
angelico
with
a
faint
condescension
but
these
pictures
bewildered
him
for
they
were
like
nothing
that
he
was
accustomed
to
look
at
and
therefore
able
to
see
when
he
travelled
in
italy
and
perhaps
also
his
powers
of
observation
were
impaired
by
the
oddness
of
finding
himself
in
this
strange
empty
house
where
apparently
no
one
expected
him
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
told
may
welland
of
countess
olenska
request
and
a
little
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
his
betrothed
might
come
in
to
see
her
cousin
what
would
she
think
if
she
found
him
sitting
there
with
the
air
of
intimacy
implied
by
waiting
alone
in
the
dusk
at
a
lady
fireside
but
since
he
had
come
he
meant
to
wait
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
stretched
his
feet
to
the
logs
it
was
odd
to
have
summoned
him
in
that
way
and
then
forgotten
him
but
archer
felt
more
curious
than
mortified
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
so
different
from
any
he
had
ever
breathed
that
vanished
in
the
sense
of
adventure
he
had
been
before
in
hung
with
red
damask
with
pictures
of
the
italian
school
what
struck
him
was
the
way
in
which
medora
shabby
hired
house
with
its
blighted
background
of
pampas
grass
and
rogers
statuettes
had
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
and
the
skilful
use
of
a
few
properties
been
transformed
into
something
intimate
foreign
subtly
suggestive
of
old
romantic
scenes
and
sentiments
he
tried
to
analyse
the
trick
to
find
a
clue
to
it
in
the
way
the
chairs
and
tables
were
grouped
in
the
fact
that
only
two
jacqueminot
roses
of
which
nobody
ever
bought
less
than
a
dozen
had
been
placed
in
the
slender
vase
at
his
elbow
and
in
the
vague
pervading
perfume
that
was
not
what
one
put
on
handkerchiefs
but
rather
like
the
scent
of
some
bazaar
a
smell
made
up
of
turkish
coffee
and
ambergris
and
dried
roses
his
mind
wandered
away
to
the
question
of
what
may
would
look
like
he
knew
that
welland
who
was
behaving
very
handsomely
already
had
his
eye
on
a
newly
built
house
in
east
street
the
neighbourhood
was
thought
remote
and
the
house
was
built
in
a
ghastly
stone
that
the
younger
architects
were
beginning
to
employ
as
a
protest
against
the
brownstone
of
which
the
uniform
hue
coated
new
york
like
a
cold
chocolate
sauce
but
the
plumbing
was
perfect
archer
would
have
liked
to
travel
to
put
off
the
housing
question
but
though
the
wellands
approved
of
an
extended
european
honeymoon
perhaps
even
a
winter
in
egypt
they
were
firm
as
to
the
need
of
a
house
for
the
returning
couple
the
young
man
felt
that
his
fate
was
sealed
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
go
up
every
evening
between
the
railings
of
that
doorstep
and
pass
through
a
pompeian
vestibule
into
a
hall
with
a
wainscoting
of
varnished
yellow
wood
but
beyond
that
his
imagination
could
not
travel
he
knew
the
above
had
a
bay
window
but
he
could
not
fancy
how
may
would
deal
with
it
she
submitted
cheerfully
to
the
purple
satin
and
yellow
tuftings
of
the
welland
to
its
sham
buhl
tables
and
gilt
vitrines
full
of
modern
saxe
he
saw
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
would
want
anything
different
in
her
own
house
and
his
only
comfort
was
to
reflect
that
she
would
probably
let
him
arrange
his
library
as
he
pleased
which
would
be
of
course
with
sincere
eastlake
furniture
and
the
plain
new
bookcases
without
glass
doors
the
maid
came
in
drew
the
curtains
pushed
back
a
log
and
said
consolingly
verra
verra
when
she
had
gone
archer
stood
up
and
began
to
wander
about
should
he
wait
any
longer
his
position
was
becoming
rather
foolish
perhaps
he
had
misunderstood
madame
olenska
perhaps
she
had
not
invited
him
after
all
down
the
cobblestones
of
the
quiet
street
came
the
ring
of
a
hoofs
they
stopped
before
the
house
and
he
caught
the
opening
of
a
carriage
door
parting
the
curtains
he
looked
out
into
the
early
dusk
a
faced
him
and
in
its
light
he
saw
julius
compact
english
brougham
drawn
by
a
big
roan
and
the
banker
descending
from
it
and
helping
out
madame
olenska
beaufort
stood
hat
in
hand
saying
something
which
his
companion
seemed
to
negative
then
they
shook
hands
and
he
jumped
into
his
carriage
while
she
mounted
the
steps
when
she
entered
the
room
she
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
archer
there
surprise
seemed
the
emotion
that
she
was
least
addicted
to
how
do
you
like
my
funny
house
she
asked
to
me
it
like
heaven
as
she
spoke
she
untied
her
little
velvet
bonnet
and
tossing
it
away
with
her
long
cloak
stood
looking
at
him
with
meditative
eyes
you
arranged
it
delightfully
he
rejoined
alive
to
the
flatness
of
the
words
but
imprisoned
in
the
conventional
by
his
consuming
desire
to
be
simple
and
striking
oh
it
a
poor
little
place
my
relations
despise
it
but
at
any
rate
it
less
gloomy
than
the
van
der
luydens
the
words
gave
him
an
electric
shock
for
few
were
the
rebellious
spirits
who
would
have
dared
to
call
the
stately
home
of
the
van
der
luydens
gloomy
those
privileged
to
enter
it
shivered
there
and
spoke
of
it
as
handsome
but
suddenly
he
was
glad
that
she
had
given
voice
to
the
general
shiver
it
delicious
what
you
done
here
he
repeated
i
like
the
little
house
she
admitted
but
i
suppose
what
i
like
is
the
blessedness
of
its
being
here
in
my
own
country
and
my
own
town
and
then
of
being
alone
in
it
she
spoke
so
low
that
he
hardly
heard
the
last
phrase
but
in
his
awkwardness
he
took
it
up
you
like
so
much
to
be
alone
yes
as
long
as
my
friends
keep
me
from
feeling
lonely
she
sat
down
near
the
fire
said
nastasia
will
bring
the
tea
presently
and
signed
to
him
to
return
to
his
armchair
adding
i
see
you
already
chosen
your
corner
leaning
back
she
folded
her
arms
behind
her
head
and
looked
at
the
fire
under
drooping
lids
this
is
the
hour
i
like
best
do
you
a
proper
sense
of
his
dignity
caused
him
to
answer
i
was
afraid
forgotten
the
hour
beaufort
must
have
been
very
engrossing
she
looked
amused
why
have
you
waited
long
beaufort
took
me
to
see
a
number
of
houses
since
it
seems
i
not
to
be
allowed
to
stay
in
this
one
she
appeared
to
dismiss
both
beaufort
and
himself
from
her
mind
and
went
on
i
never
been
in
a
city
where
there
seems
to
be
such
a
feeling
against
living
in
des
quartiers
excentriques
what
does
it
matter
where
one
lives
i
told
this
street
is
respectable
it
not
fashionable
fashionable
do
you
all
think
so
much
of
that
why
not
make
own
fashions
but
i
suppose
i
lived
too
independently
at
any
rate
i
want
to
do
what
you
all
do
i
want
to
feel
cared
for
and
safe
he
was
touched
as
he
had
been
the
evening
before
when
she
spoke
of
her
need
of
guidance
that
what
your
friends
want
you
to
feel
new
york
an
awfully
safe
place
he
added
with
a
flash
of
sarcasm
yes
is
it
one
feels
that
she
cried
missing
the
mockery
being
here
is
like
like
being
taken
on
a
holiday
when
one
has
been
a
good
little
girl
and
done
all
one
lessons
the
analogy
was
well
meant
but
did
not
altogether
please
him
he
did
not
mind
being
flippant
about
new
york
but
disliked
to
hear
any
one
else
take
the
same
tone
he
wondered
if
she
did
not
begin
to
see
what
a
powerful
engine
it
was
and
how
nearly
it
had
crushed
her
the
lovell
mingotts
dinner
patched
up
in
extremis
out
of
all
sorts
of
social
odds
and
ends
ought
to
have
taught
her
the
narrowness
of
her
escape
but
either
she
had
been
all
along
unaware
of
having
skirted
disaster
or
else
she
had
lost
sight
of
it
in
the
triumph
of
the
van
der
luyden
evening
archer
inclined
to
the
former
theory
he
fancied
that
her
new
york
was
still
completely
undifferentiated
and
the
conjecture
nettled
him
last
night
he
said
new
york
laid
itself
out
for
you
the
van
der
luydens
do
nothing
by
halves
no
how
kind
they
are
it
was
such
a
nice
party
every
one
seems
to
have
such
an
esteem
for
them
the
terms
were
hardly
adequate
she
might
have
spoken
in
that
way
of
a
at
the
dear
old
miss
lannings
the
van
der
luydens
said
archer
feeling
himself
pompous
as
he
spoke
are
the
most
powerful
influence
in
new
york
society
unfortunately
owing
to
her
health
they
receive
very
seldom
she
unclasped
her
hands
from
behind
her
head
and
looked
at
him
meditatively
is
that
perhaps
the
reason
the
reason
for
their
great
influence
that
they
make
themselves
so
rare
he
coloured
a
little
stared
at
her
and
suddenly
felt
the
penetration
of
the
remark
at
a
stroke
she
had
pricked
the
van
der
luydens
and
they
collapsed
he
laughed
and
sacrificed
them
nastasia
brought
the
tea
with
handleless
japanese
cups
and
little
covered
dishes
placing
the
tray
on
a
low
table
but
you
explain
these
things
to
me
you
tell
me
all
i
ought
to
know
madame
olenska
continued
leaning
forward
to
hand
him
his
cup
it
you
who
are
telling
me
opening
my
eyes
to
things
i
looked
at
so
long
that
i
ceased
to
see
them
she
detached
a
small
gold
from
one
of
her
bracelets
held
it
out
to
him
and
took
a
cigarette
herself
on
the
chimney
were
long
spills
for
lighting
them
ah
then
we
can
both
help
each
other
but
i
want
help
so
much
more
you
must
tell
me
just
what
to
do
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
reply
do
be
seen
driving
about
the
streets
with
beaufort
but
he
was
being
too
deeply
drawn
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
which
was
her
atmosphere
and
to
give
advice
of
that
sort
would
have
been
like
telling
some
one
who
was
bargaining
for
in
samarkand
that
one
should
always
be
provided
with
arctics
for
a
new
york
winter
new
york
seemed
much
farther
off
than
samarkand
and
if
they
were
indeed
to
help
each
other
she
was
rendering
what
might
prove
the
first
of
their
mutual
services
by
making
him
look
at
his
native
city
objectively
viewed
thus
as
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
it
looked
disconcertingly
small
and
distant
but
then
from
samarkand
it
would
a
flame
darted
from
the
logs
and
she
bent
over
the
fire
stretching
her
thin
hands
so
close
to
it
that
a
faint
halo
shone
about
the
oval
nails
the
light
touched
to
russet
the
rings
of
dark
hair
escaping
from
her
braids
and
made
her
pale
face
paler
there
are
plenty
of
people
to
tell
you
what
to
do
archer
rejoined
obscurely
envious
of
them
oh
all
my
aunts
and
my
dear
old
granny
she
considered
the
idea
impartially
they
all
a
little
vexed
with
me
for
setting
up
for
myself
poor
granny
especially
she
wanted
to
keep
me
with
her
but
i
had
to
be
free
he
was
impressed
by
this
light
way
of
speaking
of
the
formidable
catherine
and
moved
by
the
thought
of
what
must
have
given
madame
olenska
this
thirst
for
even
the
loneliest
kind
of
freedom
but
the
idea
of
beaufort
gnawed
him
i
think
i
understand
how
you
feel
he
said
still
your
family
can
advise
you
explain
differences
show
you
the
way
she
lifted
her
thin
black
eyebrows
is
new
york
such
a
labyrinth
i
thought
it
so
straight
up
and
down
like
fifth
avenue
and
with
all
the
cross
streets
numbered
she
seemed
to
guess
his
faint
disapproval
of
this
and
added
with
the
rare
smile
that
enchanted
her
whole
face
if
you
knew
how
i
like
it
for
just
that
the
and
the
big
honest
labels
on
everything
he
saw
his
chance
everything
may
be
labelled
but
everybody
is
not
perhaps
i
may
simplify
too
much
but
you
warn
me
if
i
do
she
turned
from
the
fire
to
look
at
him
there
are
only
two
people
here
who
make
me
feel
as
if
they
understood
what
i
mean
and
could
explain
things
to
me
you
and
mr
beaufort
archer
winced
at
the
joining
of
the
names
and
then
with
a
quick
readjustment
understood
sympathised
and
pitied
so
close
to
the
powers
of
evil
she
must
have
lived
that
she
still
breathed
more
freely
in
their
air
but
since
she
felt
that
he
understood
her
also
his
business
would
be
to
make
her
see
beaufort
as
he
really
was
with
all
he
represented
and
abhor
it
he
answered
gently
i
understand
but
just
at
first
do
let
go
of
your
old
friends
hands
i
mean
the
older
women
your
granny
mingott
welland
van
der
luyden
they
like
and
admire
you
they
want
to
help
you
she
shook
her
head
and
sighed
oh
i
know
i
know
but
on
condition
that
they
do
hear
anything
unpleasant
aunt
welland
put
it
in
those
very
words
when
i
tried
does
no
one
want
to
know
the
truth
here
archer
the
real
loneliness
is
living
among
all
these
kind
people
who
only
ask
one
to
pretend
she
lifted
her
hands
to
her
face
and
he
saw
her
thin
shoulders
shaken
by
a
sob
madame
olenska
oh
do
ellen
he
cried
starting
up
and
bending
over
her
he
drew
down
one
of
her
hands
clasping
and
chafing
it
like
a
child
while
he
murmured
reassuring
words
but
in
a
moment
she
freed
herself
and
looked
up
at
him
with
wet
lashes
does
no
one
cry
here
either
i
suppose
there
no
need
to
in
heaven
she
said
straightening
her
loosened
braids
with
a
laugh
and
bending
over
the
it
was
burnt
into
his
consciousness
that
he
had
called
her
ellen
called
her
so
twice
and
that
she
had
not
noticed
it
far
down
the
inverted
telescope
he
saw
the
faint
white
figure
of
may
welland
in
new
york
suddenly
nastasia
put
her
head
in
to
say
something
in
her
rich
italian
madame
olenska
again
with
a
hand
at
her
hair
uttered
an
exclamation
of
assent
a
flashing
gia
gia
and
the
duke
of
austrey
entered
piloting
a
tremendous
blackwigged
and
lady
in
overflowing
furs
my
dear
countess
i
brought
an
old
friend
of
mine
to
see
you
struthers
she
was
asked
to
the
party
last
night
and
she
wants
to
know
you
the
duke
beamed
on
the
group
and
madame
olenska
advanced
with
a
murmur
of
welcome
toward
the
queer
couple
she
seemed
to
have
no
idea
how
oddly
matched
they
were
nor
what
a
liberty
the
duke
had
taken
in
bringing
his
companion
and
to
do
him
justice
as
archer
perceived
the
duke
seemed
as
unaware
of
it
himself
of
course
i
want
to
know
you
my
dear
cried
struthers
in
a
round
rolling
voice
that
matched
her
bold
feathers
and
her
brazen
wig
i
want
to
know
everybody
who
young
and
interesting
and
charming
and
the
duke
tells
me

sunday

day

new
york

know
what
to
do
with
itself
and

i
say
to
it
and
be
amused
and
the
duke
thought
you
be
tempted
by
sarasate
you
find
a
number
of
your
friends
madame
olenska
face
grew
brilliant
with
pleasure
how
kind
how
good
of
the
duke
to
think
of
me
she
pushed
a
chair
up
to
the
and
struthers
sank
into
it
delectably
of
course
i
shall
be
too
happy
to
come

all

dear
and
bring
your
young
gentleman

you
must
be
sure
to
bring
him
the
duke
said
rather
from
the
depths
of
his
beard
and
archer
withdrew
with
a
stiffly
circular
bow
that
made
him
feel
as
full
of
spine
as
a
among
careless
and
unnoticing
elders
he
was
not
sorry
for
the
denouement
of
his
visit
he
only
wished
it
had
come
sooner
and
spared
him
a
certain
waste
of
emotion
as
he
went
out
into
the
wintry
night
new
york
again
became
vast
and
imminent
and
may
welland
the
loveliest
woman
in
it
he
turned
into
his
florist
to
send
her
the
daily
box
of
which
to
his
confusion
he
found
he
had
forgotten
that
morning
as
he
wrote
a
word
on
his
card
and
waited
for
an
envelope
he
glanced
about
the
embowered
shop
and
his
eye
lit
on
a
cluster
of
yellow
roses
he
had
never
seen
any
as
before
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
send
them
to
may
instead
of
the
lilies
but
they
did
not
look
like
her
there
was
something
too
rich
too
strong
in
their
fiery
beauty
in
a
sudden
revulsion
of
mood
and
almost
without
knowing
what
he
did
he
signed
to
the
florist
to
lay
the
roses
in
another
long
box
and
slipped
his
card
into
a
second
envelope
on
which
he
wrote
the
name
of
the
countess
olenska
then
just
as
he
was
turning
away
he
drew
the
card
out
again
and
left
the
empty
envelope
on
the
box
they
go
at
once
he
enquired
pointing
to
the
roses
the
florist
assured
him
that
they
would
x
the
next
day
he
persuaded
may
to
escape
for
a
walk
in
the
park
after
luncheon
as
was
the
custom
in
episcopalian
new
york
she
usually
accompanied
her
parents
to
church
on
sunday
afternoons
but
welland
condoned
her
truancy
having
that
very
morning
won
her
over
to
the
necessity
of
a
long
engagement
with
time
to
prepare
a
trousseau
containing
the
proper
number
of
dozens
the
day
was
delectable
the
bare
vaulting
of
trees
along
the
mall
was
ceiled
with
lapis
lazuli
and
arched
above
snow
that
shone
like
splintered
crystals
it
was
the
weather
to
call
out
may
radiance
and
she
burned
like
a
young
maple
in
the
frost
archer
was
proud
of
the
glances
turned
on
her
and
the
simple
joy
of
possessorship
cleared
away
his
underlying
perplexities
it
so
delicious
waking
every
morning
to
smell
in
one
room
she
said
yesterday
they
came
late
i
had
time
in
the
morning
but
your
remembering
each
day
to
send
them
makes
me
love
them
so
much
more
than
if
you
given
a
standing
order
and
they
came
every
morning
on
the
minute
like
one
as
i
know
gertrude
did
for
instance
when
she
and
lawrence
were
engaged
ah
they
would
laughed
archer
amused
at
her
keenness
he
looked
sideways
at
her
cheek
and
felt
rich
and
secure
enough
to
add
when
i
sent
your
lilies
yesterday
afternoon
i
saw
some
rather
gorgeous
yellow
roses
and
packed
them
off
to
madame
olenska
was
that
right
how
dear
of
you
anything
of
that
kind
delights
her
it
odd
she
did
mention
it
she
lunched
with
us
today
and
spoke
of
beaufort
having
sent
her
wonderful
orchids
and
cousin
henry
van
der
luyden
a
whole
hamper
of
carnations
from
skuytercliff
she
seems
so
surprised
to
receive
flowers
do
people
send
them
in
europe
she
thinks
it
such
a
pretty
custom
oh
well
no
wonder
mine
were
overshadowed
by
beaufort
said
archer
irritably
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
put
a
card
with
the
roses
and
was
vexed
at
having
spoken
of
them
he
wanted
to
say
i
called
on
your
cousin
yesterday
but
hesitated
if
madame
olenska
had
not
spoken
of
his
visit
it
might
seem
awkward
that
he
should
yet
not
to
do
so
gave
the
affair
an
air
of
mystery
that
he
disliked
to
shake
off
the
question
he
began
to
talk
of
their
own
plans
their
future
and
welland
insistence
on
a
long
engagement
if
you
call
it
long
isabel
chivers
and
reggie
were
engaged
for
two
years
grace
and
thorley
for
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
why
are
we
very
well
off
as
we
are
it
was
the
traditional
maidenly
interrogation
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
for
finding
it
singularly
childish
no
doubt
she
simply
echoed
what
was
said
for
her
but
she
was
nearing
her
birthday
and
he
wondered
at
what
age
nice
women
began
to
speak
for
themselves
never
if
we
wo
let
them
i
suppose
he
mused
and
recalled
his
mad
outburst
to
sillerton
jackson
women
ought
to
be
as
free
as
we
are
it
would
presently
be
his
task
to
take
the
bandage
from
this
young
woman
eyes
and
bid
her
look
forth
on
the
world
but
how
many
generations
of
the
women
who
had
gone
to
her
making
had
descended
bandaged
to
the
family
vault
he
shivered
a
little
remembering
some
of
the
new
ideas
in
his
scientific
books
and
the
instance
of
the
kentucky
which
had
ceased
to
develop
eyes
because
they
had
no
use
for
them
what
if
when
he
had
bidden
may
welland
to
open
hers
they
could
only
look
out
blankly
at
blankness
we
might
be
much
better
off
we
might
be
altogether
together
we
might
travel
her
face
lit
up
that
would
be
lovely
she
owned
she
would
love
to
travel
but
her
mother
would
not
understand
their
wanting
to
do
things
so
differently
as
if
the
mere
did
account
for
it
the
wooer
insisted
newland
you
so
original
she
exulted
his
heart
sank
for
he
saw
that
he
was
saying
all
the
things
that
young
men
in
the
same
situation
were
expected
to
say
and
that
she
was
making
the
answers
that
instinct
and
tradition
taught
her
to
make
even
to
the
point
of
calling
him
original
original
we
all
as
like
each
other
as
those
dolls
cut
out
of
the
same
folded
paper
we
like
patterns
stencilled
on
a
wall
you
and
i
strike
out
for
ourselves
may
he
had
stopped
and
faced
her
in
the
excitement
of
their
discussion
and
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
bright
unclouded
admiration
mercy
shall
we
elope
she
laughed
if
you
would
you
do
love
me
newland
i
so
happy
but
then
why
not
be
happier
we
ca
behave
like
people
in
novels
though
can
we
why
not
why
not
why
not
she
looked
a
little
bored
by
his
insistence
she
knew
very
well
that
they
could
but
it
was
troublesome
to
have
to
produce
a
reason
i
not
clever
enough
to
argue
with
you
but
that
kind
of
thing
is
rather
vulgar
is
it
she
suggested
relieved
to
have
hit
on
a
word
that
would
assuredly
extinguish
the
whole
subject
are
you
so
much
afraid
then
of
being
vulgar
she
was
evidently
staggered
by
this
of
course
i
should
hate
it
so
would
you
she
rejoined
a
trifle
irritably
he
stood
silent
beating
his
stick
nervously
against
his
and
feeling
that
she
had
indeed
found
the
right
way
of
closing
the
discussion
she
went
on
oh
did
i
tell
you
that
i
showed
ellen
my
ring
she
thinks
it
the
most
beautiful
setting
she
ever
saw
there
nothing
like
it
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
she
said
i
do
love
you
newland
for
being
so
artistic
the
next
afternoon
as
archer
before
dinner
sat
smoking
sullenly
in
his
study
janey
wandered
in
on
him
he
had
failed
to
stop
at
his
club
on
the
way
up
from
the
office
where
he
exercised
the
profession
of
the
law
in
the
leisurely
manner
common
to
new
yorkers
of
his
class
he
was
out
of
spirits
and
slightly
out
of
temper
and
a
haunting
horror
of
doing
the
same
thing
every
day
at
the
same
hour
besieged
his
brain
sameness
sameness
he
muttered
the
word
running
through
his
head
like
a
persecuting
tune
as
he
saw
the
familiar
figures
lounging
behind
the
and
because
he
usually
dropped
in
at
the
club
at
that
hour
he
had
gone
home
instead
he
knew
not
only
what
they
were
likely
to
be
talking
about
but
the
part
each
one
would
take
in
the
discussion
the
duke
of
course
would
be
their
principal
theme
though
the
appearance
in
fifth
avenue
of
a
lady
in
a
small
brougham
with
a
pair
of
black
cobs
for
which
beaufort
was
generally
thought
responsible
would
also
doubtless
be
thoroughly
gone
into
such
women
as
they
were
called
were
few
in
new
york
those
driving
their
own
carriages
still
fewer
and
the
appearance
of
miss
fanny
ring
in
fifth
avenue
at
the
fashionable
hour
had
profoundly
agitated
society
only
the
day
before
her
carriage
had
passed
lovell
mingott
and
the
latter
had
instantly
rung
the
little
bell
at
her
elbow
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
her
home
what
if
it
had
happened
to
van
der
luyden
people
asked
each
other
with
a
shudder
archer
could
hear
lawrence
lefferts
at
that
very
hour
holding
forth
on
the
disintegration
of
society
he
raised
his
head
irritably
when
his
sister
janey
entered
and
then
quickly
bent
over
his
book
swinburne
chastelard
just
out
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
she
glanced
at
the
heaped
with
books
opened
a
volume
of
the
contes
drolatiques
made
a
wry
face
over
the
archaic
french
and
sighed
what
learned
things
you
read
well
he
asked
as
she
hovered
before
him
mother
very
angry
angry
with
whom
about
what
miss
sophy
jackson
has
just
been
here
she
brought
word
that
her
brother
would
come
in
after
dinner
she
could
say
very
much
because
he
forbade
her
to
he
wishes
to
give
all
the
details
himself
with
cousin
louisa
van
der
luyden
now
for
heaven
sake
my
dear
girl
try
a
fresh
start
it
would
take
an
omniscient
deity
to
know
what
you
talking
about
it
not
a
time
to
be
profane
newland
mother
feels
badly
enough
about
your
not
going
to
church
with
a
groan
he
plunged
back
into
his
book
newland
do
listen
your
friend
madame
olenska
was
at
lemuel
struthers
party
last
night
she
went
there
with
the
duke
and
mr
beaufort
at
the
last
clause
of
this
announcement
a
senseless
anger
swelled
the
young
man
breast
to
smother
it
he
laughed
well
what
of
it
i
knew
she
meant
to
janey
paled
and
her
eyes
began
to
project
you
knew
she
meant
to
and
you
did
try
to
stop
her
to
warn
her
stop
her
warn
her
he
laughed
again
i
not
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
countess
olenska
the
words
had
a
fantastic
sound
in
his
own
ears
you
marrying
into
her
family
oh
family
family
he
jeered
newland
do
you
care
about
family
not
a
brass
farthing
nor
about
what
cousin
louisa
van
der
luyden
will
think
not
the
half
of
one
if
she
thinks
such
old
maid
rubbish
mother
is
not
an
old
maid
said
his
virgin
sister
with
pinched
lips
he
felt
like
shouting
back
yes
she
is
and
so
are
the
van
der
luydens
and
so
we
all
are
when
it
comes
to
being
so
much
as
brushed
by
the
of
reality
but
he
saw
her
long
gentle
face
puckering
into
tears
and
felt
ashamed
of
the
useless
pain
he
was
inflicting
hang
countess
olenska
do
be
a
goose
janey
i
not
her
keeper
no
but
you
did
ask
the
wellands
to
announce
your
engagement
sooner
so
that
we
might
all
back
her
up
and
if
it
had
been
for
that
cousin
louisa
would
never
have
invited
her
to
the
dinner
for
the
duke
well
what
harm
was
there
in
inviting
her
she
was
the
woman
in
the
room
she
made
the
dinner
a
little
less
funereal
than
the
usual
van
der
luyden
banquet
you
know
cousin
henry
asked
her
to
please
you
he
persuaded
cousin
louisa
and
now
they
so
upset
that
they
going
back
to
skuytercliff
tomorrow
i
think
newland
you
better
come
down
you
do
seem
to
understand
how
mother
feels
in
the
newland
found
his
mother
she
raised
a
troubled
brow
from
her
needlework
to
ask
has
janey
told
you
yes
he
tried
to
keep
his
tone
as
measured
as
her
own
but
i
take
it
very
seriously
not
the
fact
of
having
offended
cousin
louisa
and
cousin
henry
the
fact
that
they
can
be
offended
by
such
a
trifle
as
countess
olenska
going
to
the
house
of
a
woman
they
consider
common
consider
well
who
is
but
who
has
good
music
and
amuses
people
on
sunday
evenings
when
the
whole
of
new
york
is
dying
of
inanition
good
music
all
i
know
is
there
was
a
woman
who
got
up
on
a
table
and
sang
the
things
they
sing
at
the
places
you
go
to
in
paris
there
was
smoking
and
champagne
well
that
kind
of
thing
happens
in
other
places
and
the
world
still
goes
on
i
do
suppose
dear
you
really
defending
the
french
sunday
i
heard
you
often
enough
mother
grumble
at
the
english
sunday
when
we
been
in
london
new
york
is
neither
paris
nor
london
oh
no
it
not
her
son
groaned
you
mean
i
suppose
that
society
here
is
not
as
brilliant
right
i
daresay
but
we
belong
here
and
people
should
respect
our
ways
when
they
come
among
us
ellen
olenska
especially
she
came
back
to
get
away
from
the
kind
of
life
people
lead
in
brilliant
societies
newland
made
no
answer
and
after
a
moment
his
mother
ventured
i
was
going
to
put
on
my
bonnet
and
ask
you
to
take
me
to
see
cousin
louisa
for
a
moment
before
dinner
he
frowned
and
she
continued
i
thought
you
might
explain
to
her
what
you
just
said
that
society
abroad
is
different
that
people
are
not
as
particular
and
that
madame
olenska
may
not
have
realised
how
we
feel
about
such
things
it
would
be
you
know
dear
she
added
with
an
innocent
adroitness
in
madame
olenska
interest
if
you
did
dearest
mother
i
really
do
see
how
we
concerned
in
the
matter
the
duke
took
madame
olenska
to
struthers
in
fact
he
brought
struthers
to
call
on
her
i
was
there
when
they
came
if
the
van
der
luydens
want
to
quarrel
with
anybody
the
real
culprit
is
under
their
own
roof
quarrel
newland
did
you
ever
know
of
cousin
henry
quarrelling
besides
the
duke
his
guest
and
a
stranger
too
strangers
discriminate
how
should
they
countess
olenska
is
a
new
yorker
and
should
have
respected
the
feelings
of
new
york
well
then
if
they
must
have
a
victim
you
have
my
leave
to
throw
madame
olenska
to
them
cried
her
son
exasperated
i
do
see
myself
or
you
either
offering
ourselves
up
to
expiate
her
crimes
oh
of
course
you
see
only
the
mingott
side
his
mother
answered
in
the
sensitive
tone
that
was
her
nearest
approach
to
anger
the
sad
butler
drew
back
the
portieres
and
announced
henry
van
der
luyden
archer
dropped
her
needle
and
pushed
her
chair
back
with
an
agitated
hand
another
lamp
she
cried
to
the
retreating
servant
while
janey
bent
over
to
straighten
her
mother
cap
van
der
luyden
figure
loomed
on
the
threshold
and
newland
archer
went
forward
to
greet
his
cousin
we
were
just
talking
about
you
sir
he
said
van
der
luyden
seemed
overwhelmed
by
the
announcement
he
drew
off
his
glove
to
shake
hands
with
the
ladies
and
smoothed
his
tall
hat
shyly
while
janey
pushed
an
forward
and
archer
continued
and
the
countess
olenska
archer
paled
ah
a
charming
woman
i
have
just
been
to
see
her
said
van
der
luyden
complacency
restored
to
his
brow
he
sank
into
the
chair
laid
his
hat
and
gloves
on
the
floor
beside
him
in
the
way
and
went
on
she
has
a
real
gift
for
arranging
flowers
i
had
sent
her
a
few
carnations
from
skuytercliff
and
i
was
astonished
instead
of
massing
them
in
big
bunches
as
our
does
she
had
scattered
them
about
loosely
here
and
there
i
ca
say
how
the
duke
had
told
me
he
said
and
see
how
cleverly
she
arranged
her
and
she
has
i
should
really
like
to
take
louisa
to
see
her
if
the
neighbourhood
were
not
so
unpleasant
a
dead
silence
greeted
this
unusual
flow
of
words
from
van
der
luyden
archer
drew
her
embroidery
out
of
the
basket
into
which
she
had
nervously
tumbled
it
and
newland
leaning
against
the
and
twisting
a
screen
in
his
hand
saw
janey
gaping
countenance
lit
up
by
the
coming
of
the
second
lamp
the
fact
is
van
der
luyden
continued
stroking
his
long
grey
leg
with
a
bloodless
hand
weighed
down
by
the
patroon
great
the
fact
is
i
dropped
in
to
thank
her
for
the
very
pretty
note
she
wrote
me
about
my
flowers
and
also
but
this
is
between
ourselves
of
course
to
give
her
a
friendly
warning
about
allowing
the
duke
to
carry
her
off
to
parties
with
him
i
do
know
if
you
heard
archer
produced
an
indulgent
smile
has
the
duke
been
carrying
her
off
to
parties
you
know
what
these
english
grandees
are
they
all
alike
louisa
and
i
are
very
fond
of
our
cousin
but
it
hopeless
to
expect
people
who
are
accustomed
to
the
european
courts
to
trouble
themselves
about
our
little
republican
distinctions
the
duke
goes
where
he
amused
van
der
luyden
paused
but
no
one
spoke
yes
it
seems
he
took
her
with
him
last
night
to
lemuel
struthers
sillerton
jackson
has
just
been
to
us
with
the
foolish
story
and
louisa
was
rather
troubled
so
i
thought
the
shortest
way
was
to
go
straight
to
countess
olenska
and
explain
by
the
merest
hint
you
know
how
we
feel
in
new
york
about
certain
things
i
felt
i
might
without
indelicacy
because
the
evening
she
dined
with
us
she
rather
suggested
rather
let
me
see
that
she
would
be
grateful
for
guidance
and
she
was
van
der
luyden
looked
about
the
room
with
what
would
have
been
on
features
less
purged
of
the
vulgar
passions
on
his
face
it
became
a
mild
benevolence
which
archer
countenance
dutifully
reflected
how
kind
you
both
are
dear
henry
always
newland
will
particularly
appreciate
what
you
have
done
because
of
dear
may
and
his
new
relations
she
shot
an
admonitory
glance
at
her
son
who
said
immensely
sir
but
i
was
sure
you
like
madame
olenska
van
der
luyden
looked
at
him
with
extreme
gentleness
i
never
ask
to
my
house
my
dear
newland
he
said
any
one
whom
i
do
not
like
and
so
i
have
just
told
sillerton
jackson
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
he
rose
and
added
but
louisa
will
be
waiting
we
are
dining
early
to
take
the
duke
to
the
opera
after
the
portieres
had
solemnly
closed
behind
their
visitor
a
silence
fell
upon
the
archer
family
gracious
how
romantic
at
last
broke
explosively
from
janey
no
one
knew
exactly
what
inspired
her
elliptic
comments
and
her
relations
had
long
since
given
up
trying
to
interpret
them
archer
shook
her
head
with
a
sigh
provided
it
all
turns
out
for
the
best
she
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
knows
how
surely
it
will
not
newland
you
must
stay
and
see
sillerton
jackson
when
he
comes
this
evening
i
really
sha
know
what
to
say
to
him
poor
mother
but
he
wo
come
her
son
laughed
stooping
to
kiss
away
her
frown
xi
some
two
weeks
later
newland
archer
sitting
in
abstracted
idleness
in
his
private
compartment
of
the
office
of
letterblair
lamson
and
low
attorneys
at
law
was
summoned
by
the
head
of
the
firm
old
letterblair
the
accredited
legal
adviser
of
three
generations
of
new
york
gentility
throned
behind
his
mahogany
desk
in
evident
perplexity
as
he
stroked
his
closeclipped
white
whiskers
and
ran
his
hand
through
the
rumpled
grey
locks
above
his
jutting
brows
his
disrespectful
junior
partner
thought
how
much
he
looked
like
the
family
physician
annoyed
with
a
patient
whose
symptoms
refuse
to
be
classified
my
dear
sir
he
always
addressed
archer
as
sir
i
have
sent
for
you
to
go
into
a
little
matter
a
matter
which
for
the
moment
i
prefer
not
to
mention
either
to
skipworth
or
mr
redwood
the
gentlemen
he
spoke
of
were
the
other
senior
partners
of
the
firm
for
as
was
always
the
case
with
legal
associations
of
old
standing
in
new
york
all
the
partners
named
on
the
office
were
long
since
dead
and
letterblair
for
example
was
professionally
speaking
his
own
grandson
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
furrowed
brow
for
family
reasons
he
continued
archer
looked
up
the
mingott
family
said
letterblair
with
an
explanatory
smile
and
bow
manson
mingott
sent
for
me
yesterday
her
the
countess
olenska
wishes
to
sue
her
husband
for
divorce
certain
papers
have
been
placed
in
my
hands
he
paused
and
drummed
on
his
desk
in
view
of
your
prospective
alliance
with
the
family
i
should
like
to
consult
you
to
consider
the
case
with
you
before
taking
any
farther
steps
archer
felt
the
blood
in
his
temples
he
had
seen
the
countess
olenska
only
once
since
his
visit
to
her
and
then
at
the
opera
in
the
mingott
box
during
this
interval
she
had
become
a
less
vivid
and
importunate
image
receding
from
his
foreground
as
may
welland
resumed
her
rightful
place
in
it
he
had
not
heard
her
divorce
spoken
of
since
first
random
allusion
to
it
and
had
dismissed
the
tale
as
unfounded
gossip
theoretically
the
idea
of
divorce
was
almost
as
distasteful
to
him
as
to
his
mother
and
he
was
annoyed
that
letterblair
no
doubt
prompted
by
old
catherine
mingott
should
be
so
evidently
planning
to
draw
him
into
the
affair
after
all
there
were
plenty
of
mingott
men
for
such
jobs
and
as
yet
he
was
not
even
a
mingott
by
marriage
he
waited
for
the
senior
partner
to
continue
letterblair
unlocked
a
drawer
and
drew
out
a
packet
if
you
will
run
your
eye
over
these
papers
archer
frowned
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
just
because
of
the
prospective
relationship
i
should
prefer
your
consulting
skipworth
or
mr
redwood
letterblair
looked
surprised
and
slightly
offended
it
was
unusual
for
a
junior
to
reject
such
an
opening
he
bowed
i
respect
your
scruple
sir
but
in
this
case
i
believe
true
delicacy
requires
you
to
do
as
i
ask
indeed
the
suggestion
is
not
mine
but
manson
mingott
and
her
son
i
have
seen
lovell
mingott
and
also
welland
they
all
named
you
archer
felt
his
temper
rising
he
had
been
somewhat
languidly
drifting
with
events
for
the
last
fortnight
and
letting
may
fair
looks
and
radiant
nature
obliterate
the
rather
importunate
pressure
of
the
mingott
claims
but
this
behest
of
old
mingott
roused
him
to
a
sense
of
what
the
clan
thought
they
had
the
right
to
exact
from
a
prospective
and
he
chafed
at
the
role
her
uncles
ought
to
deal
with
this
he
said
they
have
the
matter
has
been
gone
into
by
the
family
they
are
opposed
to
the
countess
idea
but
she
is
firm
and
insists
on
a
legal
opinion
the
young
man
was
silent
he
had
not
opened
the
packet
in
his
hand
does
she
want
to
marry
again
i
believe
it
is
suggested
but
she
denies
it
then
will
you
oblige
me
archer
by
first
looking
through
these
papers
afterward
when
we
have
talked
the
case
over
i
will
give
you
my
opinion
archer
withdrew
reluctantly
with
the
unwelcome
documents
since
their
last
meeting
he
had
collaborated
with
events
in
ridding
himself
of
the
burden
of
madame
olenska
his
hour
alone
with
her
by
the
firelight
had
drawn
them
into
a
momentary
intimacy
on
which
the
duke
of
austrey
intrusion
with
lemuel
struthers
and
the
countess
joyous
greeting
of
them
had
rather
providentially
broken
two
days
later
archer
had
assisted
at
the
comedy
of
her
reinstatement
in
the
van
der
luydens
favour
and
had
said
to
himself
with
a
touch
of
tartness
that
a
lady
who
knew
how
to
thank
elderly
gentlemen
to
such
good
purpose
for
a
bunch
of
flowers
did
not
need
either
the
private
consolations
or
the
public
championship
of
a
young
man
of
his
small
compass
to
look
at
the
matter
in
this
light
simplified
his
own
case
and
surprisingly
furbished
up
all
the
dim
domestic
virtues
he
could
not
picture
may
welland
in
whatever
conceivable
emergency
hawking
about
her
private
difficulties
and
lavishing
her
confidences
on
strange
men
and
she
had
never
seemed
to
him
finer
or
fairer
than
in
the
week
that
followed
he
had
even
yielded
to
her
wish
for
a
long
engagement
since
she
had
found
the
one
disarming
answer
to
his
plea
for
haste
you
know
when
it
comes
to
the
point
your
parents
have
always
let
you
have
your
way
ever
since
you
were
a
little
girl
he
argued
and
she
had
answered
with
her
clearest
look
yes
and
that
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
refuse
the
very
last
thing
they
ever
ask
of
me
as
a
little
girl
that
was
the
old
new
york
note
that
was
the
kind
of
answer
he
would
like
always
to
be
sure
of
his
wife
making
if
one
had
habitually
breathed
the
new
york
air
there
were
times
when
anything
less
crystalline
seemed
stifling
the
papers
he
had
retired
to
read
did
not
tell
him
much
in
fact
but
they
plunged
him
into
an
atmosphere
in
which
he
choked
and
spluttered
they
consisted
mainly
of
an
exchange
of
letters
between
count
solicitors
and
a
french
legal
firm
to
whom
the
countess
had
applied
for
the
settlement
of
her
financial
situation
there
was
also
a
short
letter
from
the
count
to
his
wife
after
reading
it
newland
archer
rose
jammed
the
papers
back
into
their
envelope
and
reentered
letterblair
office
here
are
the
letters
sir
if
you
wish
i
see
madame
olenska
he
said
in
a
constrained
voice
thank
you
thank
you
archer
come
and
dine
with
me
tonight
if
you
free
and
we
go
into
the
matter
afterward
in
case
you
wish
to
call
on
our
client
tomorrow
newland
archer
walked
straight
home
again
that
afternoon
it
was
a
winter
evening
of
transparent
clearness
with
an
innocent
young
moon
above
the
and
he
wanted
to
fill
his
soul
lungs
with
the
pure
radiance
and
not
exchange
a
word
with
any
one
till
he
and
letterblair
were
closeted
together
after
dinner
it
was
impossible
to
decide
otherwise
than
he
had
done
he
must
see
madame
olenska
himself
rather
than
let
her
secrets
be
bared
to
other
eyes
a
great
wave
of
compassion
had
swept
away
his
indifference
and
impatience
she
stood
before
him
as
an
exposed
and
pitiful
figure
to
be
saved
at
all
costs
from
farther
wounding
herself
in
her
mad
plunges
against
fate
he
remembered
what
she
had
told
him
of
welland
request
to
be
spared
whatever
was
unpleasant
in
her
history
and
winced
at
the
thought
that
it
was
perhaps
this
attitude
of
mind
which
kept
the
new
york
air
so
pure
are
we
only
pharisees
after
all
he
wondered
puzzled
by
the
effort
to
reconcile
his
instinctive
disgust
at
human
vileness
with
his
equally
instinctive
pity
for
human
frailty
for
the
first
time
he
perceived
how
elementary
his
own
principles
had
always
been
he
passed
for
a
young
man
who
had
not
been
afraid
of
risks
and
he
knew
that
his
secret
with
poor
silly
thorley
rushworth
had
not
been
too
secret
to
invest
him
with
a
becoming
air
of
adventure
but
rushworth
was
that
kind
of
woman
foolish
vain
clandestine
by
nature
and
far
more
attracted
by
the
secrecy
and
peril
of
the
affair
than
by
such
charms
and
qualities
as
he
possessed
when
the
fact
dawned
on
him
it
nearly
broke
his
heart
but
now
it
seemed
the
redeeming
feature
of
the
case
the
affair
in
short
had
been
of
the
kind
that
most
of
the
young
men
of
his
age
had
been
through
and
emerged
from
with
calm
consciences
and
an
undisturbed
belief
in
the
abysmal
distinction
between
the
women
one
loved
and
respected
and
those
one
enjoyed
and
pitied
in
this
view
they
were
sedulously
abetted
by
their
mothers
aunts
and
other
elderly
female
relatives
who
all
shared
archer
belief
that
when
such
things
happened
it
was
undoubtedly
foolish
of
the
man
but
somehow
always
criminal
of
the
woman
all
the
elderly
ladies
whom
archer
knew
regarded
any
woman
who
loved
imprudently
as
necessarily
unscrupulous
and
designing
and
mere
man
as
powerless
in
her
clutches
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
persuade
him
as
early
as
possible
to
marry
a
nice
girl
and
then
trust
to
her
to
look
after
him
in
the
complicated
old
european
communities
archer
began
to
guess
might
be
less
simple
and
less
easily
classified
rich
and
idle
and
ornamental
societies
must
produce
many
more
such
situations
and
there
might
even
be
one
in
which
a
woman
naturally
sensitive
and
aloof
would
yet
from
the
force
of
circumstances
from
sheer
defencelessness
and
loneliness
be
drawn
into
a
tie
inexcusable
by
conventional
standards
on
reaching
home
he
wrote
a
line
to
the
countess
olenska
asking
at
what
hour
of
the
next
day
she
could
receive
him
and
despatched
it
by
a
who
returned
presently
with
a
word
to
the
effect
that
she
was
going
to
skuytercliff
the
next
morning
to
stay
over
sunday
with
the
van
der
luydens
but
that
he
would
find
her
alone
that
evening
after
dinner
the
note
was
written
on
a
rather
untidy
without
date
or
address
but
her
hand
was
firm
and
free
he
was
amused
at
the
idea
of
her
in
the
stately
solitude
of
skuytercliff
but
immediately
afterward
felt
that
there
of
all
places
she
would
most
feel
the
chill
of
minds
rigorously
averted
from
the
unpleasant
he
was
at
letterblair
punctually
at
seven
glad
of
the
pretext
for
excusing
himself
soon
after
dinner
he
had
formed
his
own
opinion
from
the
papers
entrusted
to
him
and
did
not
especially
want
to
go
into
the
matter
with
his
senior
partner
letterblair
was
a
widower
and
they
dined
alone
copiously
and
slowly
in
a
dark
shabby
room
hung
with
yellowing
prints
of
the
death
of
chatham
and
the
coronation
of
napoleon
on
the
sideboard
between
fluted
sheraton
stood
a
decanter
of
haut
brion
and
another
of
the
old
lanning
port
the
gift
of
a
client
which
the
wastrel
tom
lanning
had
sold
off
a
year
or
two
before
his
mysterious
and
discreditable
death
in
san
francisco
an
incident
less
publicly
humiliating
to
the
family
than
the
sale
of
the
cellar
after
a
velvety
oyster
soup
came
shad
and
cucumbers
then
a
young
broiled
turkey
with
corn
fritters
followed
by
a
with
currant
jelly
and
a
celery
mayonnaise
letterblair
who
lunched
on
a
sandwich
and
tea
dined
deliberately
and
deeply
and
insisted
on
his
guest
doing
the
same
finally
when
the
closing
rites
had
been
accomplished
the
cloth
was
removed
cigars
were
lit
and
letterblair
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
pushing
the
port
westward
said
spreading
his
back
agreeably
to
the
coal
fire
behind
him
the
whole
family
are
against
a
divorce
and
i
think
rightly
archer
instantly
felt
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
argument
but
why
sir
if
there
ever
was
a
case
well
what
the
use
she
here
he
there
the
atlantic
between
them
she
never
get
back
a
dollar
more
of
her
money
than
what
voluntarily
returned
to
her
their
damned
heathen
marriage
settlements
take
precious
good
care
of
that
as
things
go
over
there
acted
generously
he
might
have
turned
her
out
without
a
penny
the
young
man
knew
this
and
was
silent
i
understand
though
letterblair
continued
that
she
attaches
no
importance
to
the
money
therefore
as
the
family
say
why
not
let
well
enough
alone
archer
had
gone
to
the
house
an
hour
earlier
in
full
agreement
with
letterblair
view
but
put
into
words
by
this
selfish
and
supremely
indifferent
old
man
it
suddenly
became
the
pharisaic
voice
of
a
society
wholly
absorbed
in
barricading
itself
against
the
unpleasant
i
think
that
for
her
to
decide
h
have
you
considered
the
consequences
if
she
decides
for
divorce
you
mean
the
threat
in
her
husband
letter
what
weight
would
that
carry
it
no
more
than
the
vague
charge
of
an
angry
blackguard
yes
but
it
might
make
some
unpleasant
talk
if
he
really
defends
the
suit
unpleasant
said
archer
explosively
letterblair
looked
at
him
from
under
enquiring
eyebrows
and
the
young
man
aware
of
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
explain
what
was
in
his
mind
bowed
acquiescently
while
his
senior
continued
divorce
is
always
unpleasant
you
agree
with
me
letterblair
resumed
after
a
waiting
silence
naturally
said
archer
well
then
i
may
count
on
you
the
mingotts
may
count
on
you
to
use
your
influence
against
the
idea
archer
hesitated
i
ca
pledge
myself
till
i
seen
the
countess
olenska
he
said
at
length
archer
i
do
understand
you
do
you
want
to
marry
into
a
family
with
a
scandalous
hanging
over
it
i
do
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
letterblair
put
down
his
glass
of
port
and
fixed
on
his
young
partner
a
cautious
and
apprehensive
gaze
archer
understood
that
he
ran
the
risk
of
having
his
mandate
withdrawn
and
for
some
obscure
reason
he
disliked
the
prospect
now
that
the
job
had
been
thrust
on
him
he
did
not
propose
to
relinquish
it
and
to
guard
against
the
possibility
he
saw
that
he
must
reassure
the
unimaginative
old
man
who
was
the
legal
conscience
of
the
mingotts
you
may
be
sure
sir
that
i
sha
commit
myself
till
i
reported
to
you
what
i
meant
was
that
i
rather
not
give
an
opinion
till
heard
what
madame
olenska
has
to
say
letterblair
nodded
approvingly
at
an
excess
of
caution
worthy
of
the
best
new
york
tradition
and
the
young
man
glancing
at
his
watch
pleaded
an
engagement
and
took
leave
xii
new
york
dined
at
seven
and
the
habit
of
calls
though
derided
in
archer
set
still
generally
prevailed
as
the
young
man
strolled
up
fifth
avenue
from
waverley
place
the
long
thoroughfare
was
deserted
but
for
a
group
of
carriages
standing
before
the
reggie
chiverses
where
there
was
a
dinner
for
the
duke
and
the
occasional
figure
of
an
elderly
gentleman
in
heavy
overcoat
and
muffler
ascending
a
brownstone
doorstep
and
disappearing
into
a
hall
thus
as
archer
crossed
washington
square
he
remarked
that
old
du
lac
was
calling
on
his
cousins
the
dagonets
and
turning
down
the
corner
of
west
tenth
street
he
saw
skipworth
of
his
own
firm
obviously
bound
on
a
visit
to
the
miss
lannings
a
little
farther
up
fifth
avenue
beaufort
appeared
on
his
doorstep
darkly
projected
against
a
blaze
of
light
descended
to
his
private
brougham
and
rolled
away
to
a
mysterious
and
probably
unmentionable
destination
it
was
not
an
opera
night
and
no
one
was
giving
a
party
so
that
outing
was
undoubtedly
of
a
clandestine
nature
archer
connected
it
in
his
mind
with
a
little
house
beyond
lexington
avenue
in
which
beribboned
window
curtains
and
had
recently
appeared
and
before
whose
newly
painted
door
the
brougham
of
miss
fanny
ring
was
frequently
seen
to
wait
beyond
the
small
and
slippery
pyramid
which
composed
world
lay
the
almost
unmapped
quarter
inhabited
by
artists
musicians
and
people
who
wrote
these
scattered
fragments
of
humanity
had
never
shown
any
desire
to
be
amalgamated
with
the
social
structure
in
spite
of
odd
ways
they
were
said
to
be
for
the
most
part
quite
respectable
but
they
preferred
to
keep
to
themselves
medora
manson
in
her
prosperous
days
had
inaugurated
a
literary
salon
but
it
had
soon
died
out
owing
to
the
reluctance
of
the
literary
to
frequent
it
others
had
made
the
same
attempt
and
there
was
a
household
of
blenkers
an
intense
and
voluble
mother
and
three
blowsy
daughters
who
imitated
her
where
one
met
edwin
booth
and
patti
and
william
winter
and
the
new
shakespearian
actor
george
rignold
and
some
of
the
magazine
editors
and
musical
and
literary
critics
archer
and
her
group
felt
a
certain
timidity
concerning
these
persons
they
were
odd
they
were
uncertain
they
had
things
one
did
know
about
in
the
background
of
their
lives
and
minds
literature
and
art
were
deeply
respected
in
the
archer
set
and
archer
was
always
at
pains
to
tell
her
children
how
much
more
agreeable
and
cultivated
society
had
been
when
it
included
such
figures
as
washington
irving
halleck
and
the
poet
of
the
culprit
fay
the
most
celebrated
authors
of
that
generation
had
been
gentlemen
perhaps
the
unknown
persons
who
succeeded
them
had
gentlemanly
sentiments
but
their
origin
their
appearance
their
hair
their
intimacy
with
the
stage
and
the
opera
made
any
old
new
york
criterion
inapplicable
to
them
when
i
was
a
girl
archer
used
to
say
we
knew
everybody
between
the
battery
and
canal
street
and
only
the
people
one
knew
had
carriages
it
was
perfectly
easy
to
place
any
one
then
now
one
tell
and
i
prefer
not
to
try
only
old
catherine
mingott
with
her
absence
of
moral
prejudices
and
almost
parvenu
indifference
to
the
subtler
distinctions
might
have
bridged
the
abyss
but
she
had
never
opened
a
book
or
looked
at
a
picture
and
cared
for
music
only
because
it
reminded
her
of
gala
nights
at
the
italiens
in
the
days
of
her
triumph
at
the
tuileries
possibly
beaufort
who
was
her
match
in
daring
would
have
succeeded
in
bringing
about
a
fusion
but
his
grand
house
and
footmen
were
an
obstacle
to
informal
sociability
moreover
he
was
as
illiterate
as
old
mingott
and
considered
fellows
who
wrote
as
the
mere
paid
purveyors
of
rich
men
pleasures
and
no
one
rich
enough
to
influence
his
opinion
had
ever
questioned
it
newland
archer
had
been
aware
of
these
things
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
had
accepted
them
as
part
of
the
structure
of
his
universe
he
knew
that
there
were
societies
where
painters
and
poets
and
novelists
and
men
of
science
and
even
great
actors
were
as
sought
after
as
dukes
he
had
often
pictured
to
himself
what
it
would
have
been
to
live
in
the
intimacy
of
dominated
by
the
talk
of
merimee
whose
lettres
a
une
inconnue
was
one
of
his
inseparables
of
thackeray
browning
or
william
morris
but
such
things
were
inconceivable
in
new
york
and
unsettling
to
think
of
archer
knew
most
of
the
fellows
who
wrote
the
musicians
and
the
painters
he
met
them
at
the
century
or
at
the
little
musical
and
theatrical
clubs
that
were
beginning
to
come
into
existence
he
enjoyed
them
there
and
was
bored
with
them
at
the
blenkers
where
they
were
mingled
with
fervid
and
dowdy
women
who
passed
them
about
like
captured
curiosities
and
even
after
his
most
exciting
talks
with
ned
winsett
he
always
came
away
with
the
feeling
that
if
his
world
was
small
so
was
theirs
and
that
the
only
way
to
enlarge
either
was
to
reach
a
stage
of
manners
where
they
would
naturally
merge
he
was
reminded
of
this
by
trying
to
picture
the
society
in
which
the
countess
olenska
had
lived
and
suffered
and
also
perhaps
tasted
mysterious
joys
he
remembered
with
what
amusement
she
had
told
him
that
her
grandmother
mingott
and
the
wellands
objected
to
her
living
in
a
bohemian
quarter
given
over
to
people
who
wrote
it
was
not
the
peril
but
the
poverty
that
her
family
disliked
but
that
shade
escaped
her
and
she
supposed
they
considered
literature
compromising
she
herself
had
no
fears
of
it
and
the
books
scattered
about
her
a
part
of
the
house
in
which
books
were
usually
supposed
to
be
out
of
place
though
chiefly
works
of
fiction
had
whetted
archer
interest
with
such
new
names
as
those
of
paul
bourget
huysmans
and
the
goncourt
brothers
ruminating
on
these
things
as
he
approached
her
door
he
was
once
more
conscious
of
the
curious
way
in
which
she
reversed
his
values
and
of
the
need
of
thinking
himself
into
conditions
incredibly
different
from
any
that
he
knew
if
he
were
to
be
of
use
in
her
present
difficulty
nastasia
opened
the
door
smiling
mysteriously
on
the
bench
in
the
hall
lay
a
overcoat
a
folded
opera
hat
of
dull
silk
with
a
gold
j
on
the
lining
and
a
white
silk
muffler
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
these
costly
articles
were
the
property
of
julius
beaufort
archer
was
angry
so
angry
that
he
came
near
scribbling
a
word
on
his
card
and
going
away
then
he
remembered
that
in
writing
to
madame
olenska
he
had
been
kept
by
excess
of
discretion
from
saying
that
he
wished
to
see
her
privately
he
had
therefore
no
one
but
himself
to
blame
if
she
had
opened
her
doors
to
other
visitors
and
he
entered
the
with
the
dogged
determination
to
make
beaufort
feel
himself
in
the
way
and
to
outstay
him
the
banker
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelshelf
which
was
draped
with
an
old
embroidery
held
in
place
by
brass
candelabra
containing
church
candles
of
yellowish
wax
he
had
thrust
his
chest
out
supporting
his
shoulders
against
the
mantel
and
resting
his
weight
on
one
large
foot
as
archer
entered
he
was
smiling
and
looking
down
on
his
hostess
who
sat
on
a
sofa
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
chimney
a
table
banked
with
flowers
formed
a
screen
behind
it
and
against
the
orchids
and
azaleas
which
the
young
man
recognised
as
tributes
from
the
beaufort
madame
olenska
sat
her
head
propped
on
a
hand
and
her
wide
sleeve
leaving
the
arm
bare
to
the
elbow
it
was
usual
for
ladies
who
received
in
the
evenings
to
wear
what
were
called
simple
dinner
dresses
a
armour
of
silk
slightly
open
in
the
neck
with
lace
ruffles
filling
in
the
crack
and
tight
sleeves
with
a
flounce
uncovering
just
enough
wrist
to
show
an
etruscan
gold
bracelet
or
a
velvet
band
but
madame
olenska
heedless
of
tradition
was
attired
in
a
long
robe
of
red
velvet
bordered
about
the
chin
and
down
the
front
with
glossy
black
fur
archer
remembered
on
his
last
visit
to
paris
seeing
a
portrait
by
the
new
painter
carolus
duran
whose
pictures
were
the
sensation
of
the
salon
in
which
the
lady
wore
one
of
these
bold
robes
with
her
chin
nestling
in
fur
there
was
something
perverse
and
provocative
in
the
notion
of
fur
worn
in
the
evening
in
a
heated
and
in
the
combination
of
a
muffled
throat
and
bare
arms
but
the
effect
was
undeniably
pleasing
lord
love
us
three
whole
days
at
skuytercliff
beaufort
was
saying
in
his
loud
sneering
voice
as
archer
entered
you
better
take
all
your
furs
and
a
why
is
the
house
so
cold
she
asked
holding
out
her
left
hand
to
archer
in
a
way
mysteriously
suggesting
that
she
expected
him
to
kiss
it
no
but
the
missus
is
said
beaufort
nodding
carelessly
to
the
young
man
but
i
thought
her
so
kind
she
came
herself
to
invite
me
granny
says
i
must
certainly
go
granny
would
of
course
and
i
say
it
a
shame
you
going
to
miss
the
little
oyster
supper
i
planned
for
you
at
delmonico
next
sunday
with
campanini
and
scalchi
and
a
lot
of
jolly
people
she
looked
doubtfully
from
the
banker
to
archer
ah
that
does
tempt
me
except
the
other
evening
at
i
not
met
a
single
artist
since
i
been
here
what
kind
of
artists
i
know
one
or
two
painters
very
good
fellows
that
i
could
bring
to
see
you
if
you
allow
me
said
archer
boldly
painters
are
there
painters
in
new
york
asked
beaufort
in
a
tone
implying
that
there
could
be
none
since
he
did
not
buy
their
pictures
and
madame
olenska
said
to
archer
with
her
grave
smile
that
would
be
charming
but
i
was
really
thinking
of
dramatic
artists
singers
actors
musicians
my
husband
house
was
always
full
of
them
she
said
the
words
my
husband
as
if
no
sinister
associations
were
connected
with
them
and
in
a
tone
that
seemed
almost
to
sigh
over
the
lost
delights
of
her
married
life
archer
looked
at
her
perplexedly
wondering
if
it
were
lightness
or
dissimulation
that
enabled
her
to
touch
so
easily
on
the
past
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
risking
her
reputation
in
order
to
break
with
it
i
do
think
she
went
on
addressing
both
men
that
the
imprevu
adds
to
one
enjoyment
it
perhaps
a
mistake
to
see
the
same
people
every
day
it
confoundedly
dull
anyhow
new
york
is
dying
of
dullness
beaufort
grumbled
and
when
i
try
to
liven
it
up
for
you
you
go
back
on
me
come
think
better
of
it
sunday
is
your
last
chance
for
campanini
leaves
next
week
for
baltimore
and
philadelphia
and
i
a
private
room
and
a
steinway
and
they
sing
all
night
for
me
how
delicious
may
i
think
it
over
and
write
to
you
tomorrow
morning
she
spoke
amiably
yet
with
the
least
hint
of
dismissal
in
her
voice
beaufort
evidently
felt
it
and
being
unused
to
dismissals
stood
staring
at
her
with
an
obstinate
line
between
his
eyes
why
not
now
it
too
serious
a
question
to
decide
at
this
late
hour
do
you
call
it
late
she
returned
his
glance
coolly
yes
because
i
have
still
to
talk
business
with
archer
for
a
little
while
ah
beaufort
snapped
there
was
no
appeal
from
her
tone
and
with
a
slight
shrug
he
recovered
his
composure
took
her
hand
which
he
kissed
with
a
practised
air
and
calling
out
from
the
threshold
i
say
newland
if
you
can
persuade
the
countess
to
stop
in
town
of
course
you
included
in
the
supper
left
the
room
with
his
heavy
important
step
for
a
moment
archer
fancied
that
letterblair
must
have
told
her
of
his
coming
but
the
irrelevance
of
her
next
remark
made
him
change
his
mind
you
know
painters
then
you
live
in
their
milieu
she
asked
her
eyes
full
of
interest
oh
not
exactly
i
do
know
that
the
arts
have
a
milieu
here
any
of
them
they
more
like
a
very
thinly
settled
outskirt
but
you
care
for
such
things
immensely
when
i
in
paris
or
london
i
never
miss
an
exhibition
i
try
to
keep
up
she
looked
down
at
the
tip
of
the
little
satin
boot
that
peeped
from
her
long
draperies
i
used
to
care
immensely
too
my
life
was
full
of
such
things
but
now
i
want
to
try
not
to
you
want
to
try
not
to
yes
i
want
to
cast
off
all
my
old
life
to
become
just
like
everybody
else
here
archer
reddened
you
never
be
like
everybody
else
he
said
she
raised
her
straight
eyebrows
a
little
ah
do
say
that
if
you
knew
how
i
hate
to
be
different
her
face
had
grown
as
sombre
as
a
tragic
mask
she
leaned
forward
clasping
her
knee
in
her
thin
hands
and
looking
away
from
him
into
remote
dark
distances
i
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
she
insisted
he
waited
a
moment
and
cleared
his
throat
i
know
letterblair
has
told
me
ah
that
the
reason
i
come
he
asked
me
to
you
see
i
in
the
firm
she
looked
slightly
surprised
and
then
her
eyes
brightened
you
mean
you
can
manage
it
for
me
i
can
talk
to
you
instead
of
letterblair
oh
that
will
be
so
much
easier
her
tone
touched
him
and
his
confidence
grew
with
his
he
perceived
that
she
had
spoken
of
business
to
beaufort
simply
to
get
rid
of
him
and
to
have
routed
beaufort
was
something
of
a
triumph
i
am
here
to
talk
about
it
he
repeated
she
sat
silent
her
head
still
propped
by
the
arm
that
rested
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
her
face
looked
pale
and
extinguished
as
if
dimmed
by
the
rich
red
of
her
dress
she
struck
archer
of
a
sudden
as
a
pathetic
and
even
pitiful
figure
now
we
coming
to
hard
facts
he
thought
conscious
in
himself
of
the
same
instinctive
recoil
that
he
had
so
often
criticised
in
his
mother
and
her
contemporaries
how
little
practice
he
had
had
in
dealing
with
unusual
situations
their
very
vocabulary
was
unfamiliar
to
him
and
seemed
to
belong
to
fiction
and
the
stage
in
face
of
what
was
coming
he
felt
as
awkward
and
embarrassed
as
a
boy
after
a
pause
madame
olenska
broke
out
with
unexpected
vehemence
i
want
to
be
free
i
want
to
wipe
out
all
the
past
i
understand
that
her
face
warmed
then
you
help
me
first
he
hesitated
perhaps
i
ought
to
know
a
little
more
she
seemed
surprised
you
know
about
my
husband
my
life
with
him
he
made
a
sign
of
assent
well
then
what
more
is
there
in
this
country
are
such
things
tolerated
i
a
protestant
our
church
does
not
forbid
divorce
in
such
cases
certainly
not
they
were
both
silent
again
and
archer
felt
the
spectre
of
count
olenski
letter
grimacing
hideously
between
them
the
letter
filled
only
half
a
page
and
was
just
what
he
had
described
it
to
be
in
speaking
of
it
to
letterblair
the
vague
charge
of
an
angry
blackguard
but
how
much
truth
was
behind
it
only
count
wife
could
tell
i
looked
through
the
papers
you
gave
to
letterblair
he
said
at
length
well
can
there
be
anything
more
abominable
no
she
changed
her
position
slightly
screening
her
eyes
with
her
lifted
hand
of
course
you
know
archer
continued
that
if
your
husband
chooses
to
fight
the
case
as
he
threatens
to
yes
he
can
say
things
things
that
might
be
unpl
might
be
disagreeable
to
you
say
them
publicly
so
that
they
would
get
about
and
harm
you
even
if
if
i
mean
no
matter
how
unfounded
they
were
she
paused
for
a
long
interval
so
long
that
not
wishing
to
keep
his
eyes
on
her
shaded
face
he
had
time
to
imprint
on
his
mind
the
exact
shape
of
her
other
hand
the
one
on
her
knee
and
every
detail
of
the
three
rings
on
her
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
among
which
he
noticed
a
wedding
ring
did
not
appear
what
harm
could
such
accusations
even
if
he
made
them
publicly
do
me
here
it
was
on
his
lips
to
exclaim
my
poor
child
far
more
harm
than
anywhere
else
instead
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
sounded
in
his
ears
like
letterblair
new
york
society
is
a
very
small
world
compared
with
the
one
you
lived
in
and
it
ruled
in
spite
of
appearances
by
a
few
people
with
well
rather
ideas
she
said
nothing
and
he
continued
our
ideas
about
marriage
and
divorce
are
particularly
our
legislation
favours
divorce
our
social
customs
do
never
well
not
if
the
woman
however
injured
however
irreproachable
has
appearances
in
the
least
degree
against
her
has
exposed
herself
by
any
unconventional
action
to
to
offensive
insinuations
she
drooped
her
head
a
little
lower
and
he
waited
again
intensely
hoping
for
a
flash
of
indignation
or
at
least
a
brief
cry
of
denial
none
came
a
little
travelling
clock
ticked
purringly
at
her
elbow
and
a
log
broke
in
two
and
sent
up
a
shower
of
sparks
the
whole
hushed
and
brooding
room
seemed
to
be
waiting
silently
with
archer
yes
she
murmured
at
length
that
what
my
family
tell
me
he
winced
a
little
it
not
unnatural
our
family
she
corrected
herself
and
archer
coloured
for
be
my
cousin
soon
she
continued
gently
i
hope
so
and
you
take
their
view
he
stood
up
at
this
wandered
across
the
room
stared
with
void
eyes
at
one
of
the
pictures
against
the
old
red
damask
and
came
back
irresolutely
to
her
side
how
could
he
say
yes
if
what
your
husband
hints
is
true
or
if
you
no
way
of
disproving
it
sincerely
she
interjected
as
he
was
about
to
speak
he
looked
down
into
the
fire
sincerely
then
what
should
you
gain
that
would
compensate
for
the
possibility
the
certainty
of
a
lot
of
beastly
talk
but
my
freedom
is
that
nothing
it
flashed
across
him
at
that
instant
that
the
charge
in
the
letter
was
true
and
that
she
hoped
to
marry
the
partner
of
her
guilt
how
was
he
to
tell
her
that
if
she
really
cherished
such
a
plan
the
laws
of
the
state
were
inexorably
opposed
to
it
the
mere
suspicion
that
the
thought
was
in
her
mind
made
him
feel
harshly
and
impatiently
toward
her
but
are
you
as
free
as
air
as
it
is
he
returned
who
can
touch
you
letterblair
tells
me
the
financial
question
has
been
settled
oh
yes
she
said
indifferently
well
then
is
it
worth
while
to
risk
what
may
be
infinitely
disagreeable
and
painful
think
of
the
newspapers
their
vileness
it
all
stupid
and
narrow
and
unjust
but
one
ca
make
over
society
no
she
acquiesced
and
her
tone
was
so
faint
and
desolate
that
he
felt
a
sudden
remorse
for
his
own
hard
thoughts
the
individual
in
such
cases
is
nearly
always
sacrificed
to
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
collective
interest
people
cling
to
any
convention
that
keeps
the
family
together
protects
the
children
if
there
are
any
he
rambled
on
pouring
out
all
the
stock
phrases
that
rose
to
his
lips
in
his
intense
desire
to
cover
over
the
ugly
reality
which
her
silence
seemed
to
have
laid
bare
since
she
would
not
or
could
not
say
the
one
word
that
would
have
cleared
the
air
his
wish
was
not
to
let
her
feel
that
he
was
trying
to
probe
into
her
secret
better
keep
on
the
surface
in
the
prudent
old
new
york
way
than
risk
uncovering
a
wound
he
could
not
heal
it
my
business
you
know
he
went
on
to
help
you
to
see
these
things
as
the
people
who
are
fondest
of
you
see
them
the
mingotts
the
wellands
the
van
der
luydens
all
your
friends
and
relations
if
i
did
show
you
honestly
how
they
judge
such
questions
it
would
be
fair
of
me
would
it
he
spoke
insistently
almost
pleading
with
her
in
his
eagerness
to
cover
up
that
yawning
silence
she
said
slowly
no
it
would
be
fair
the
fire
had
crumbled
down
to
greyness
and
one
of
the
lamps
made
a
gurgling
appeal
for
attention
madame
olenska
rose
wound
it
up
and
returned
to
the
fire
but
without
resuming
her
seat
her
remaining
on
her
feet
seemed
to
signify
that
there
was
nothing
more
for
either
of
them
to
say
and
archer
stood
up
also
very
well
i
will
do
what
you
wish
she
said
abruptly
the
blood
rushed
to
his
forehead
and
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
her
surrender
he
caught
her
two
hands
awkwardly
in
his
i
i
do
want
to
help
you
he
said
you
do
help
me
good
night
my
cousin
he
bent
and
laid
his
lips
on
her
hands
which
were
cold
and
lifeless
she
drew
them
away
and
he
turned
to
the
door
found
his
coat
and
hat
under
the
faint
of
the
hall
and
plunged
out
into
the
winter
night
bursting
with
the
belated
eloquence
of
the
inarticulate
xiii
it
was
a
crowded
night
at
wallack
theatre
the
play
was
the
shaughraun
with
dion
boucicault
in
the
title
role
and
harry
montague
and
ada
dyas
as
the
lovers
the
popularity
of
the
admirable
english
company
was
at
its
height
and
the
shaughraun
always
packed
the
house
in
the
galleries
the
enthusiasm
was
unreserved
in
the
stalls
and
boxes
people
smiled
a
little
at
the
hackneyed
sentiments
and
situations
and
enjoyed
the
play
as
much
as
the
galleries
did
there
was
one
episode
in
particular
that
held
the
house
from
floor
to
ceiling
it
was
that
in
which
harry
montague
after
a
sad
almost
monosyllabic
scene
of
parting
with
miss
dyas
bade
her
and
turned
to
go
the
actress
who
was
standing
near
the
mantelpiece
and
looking
down
into
the
fire
wore
a
gray
cashmere
dress
without
fashionable
loopings
or
trimmings
moulded
to
her
tall
figure
and
flowing
in
long
lines
about
her
feet
around
her
neck
was
a
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
with
the
ends
falling
down
her
back
when
her
wooer
turned
from
her
she
rested
her
arms
against
the
and
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
on
the
threshold
he
paused
to
look
at
her
then
he
stole
back
lifted
one
of
the
ends
of
velvet
ribbon
kissed
it
and
left
the
room
without
her
hearing
him
or
changing
her
attitude
and
on
this
silent
parting
the
curtain
fell
it
was
always
for
the
sake
of
that
particular
scene
that
newland
archer
went
to
see
the
shaughraun
he
thought
the
adieux
of
montague
and
ada
dyas
as
fine
as
anything
he
had
ever
seen
croisette
and
bressant
do
in
paris
or
madge
robertson
and
kendal
in
london
in
its
reticence
its
dumb
sorrow
it
moved
him
more
than
the
most
famous
histrionic
outpourings
on
the
evening
in
question
the
little
scene
acquired
an
added
poignancy
by
reminding
him
he
could
not
have
said
why
of
his
from
madame
olenska
after
their
confidential
talk
a
week
or
ten
days
earlier
it
would
have
been
as
difficult
to
discover
any
resemblance
between
the
two
situations
as
between
the
appearance
of
the
persons
concerned
newland
archer
could
not
pretend
to
anything
approaching
the
young
english
actor
romantic
good
looks
and
miss
dyas
was
a
tall
woman
of
monumental
build
whose
pale
and
pleasantly
ugly
face
was
utterly
unlike
ellen
olenska
vivid
countenance
nor
were
archer
and
madame
olenska
two
lovers
parting
in
silence
they
were
client
and
lawyer
separating
after
a
talk
which
had
given
the
lawyer
the
worst
possible
impression
of
the
client
case
wherein
then
lay
the
resemblance
that
made
the
young
man
heart
beat
with
a
kind
of
retrospective
excitement
it
seemed
to
be
in
madame
mysterious
faculty
of
suggesting
tragic
and
moving
possibilities
outside
the
daily
run
of
experience
she
had
hardly
ever
said
a
word
to
him
to
produce
this
impression
but
it
was
a
part
of
her
either
a
projection
of
her
mysterious
and
outlandish
background
or
of
something
inherently
dramatic
passionate
and
unusual
in
herself
archer
had
always
been
inclined
to
think
that
chance
and
circumstance
played
a
small
part
in
shaping
people
lots
compared
with
their
innate
tendency
to
have
things
happen
to
them
this
tendency
he
had
felt
from
the
first
in
madame
olenska
the
quiet
almost
passive
young
woman
struck
him
as
exactly
the
kind
of
person
to
whom
things
were
bound
to
happen
no
matter
how
much
she
shrank
from
them
and
went
out
of
her
way
to
avoid
them
the
exciting
fact
was
her
having
lived
in
an
atmosphere
so
thick
with
drama
that
her
own
tendency
to
provoke
it
had
apparently
passed
unperceived
it
was
precisely
the
odd
absence
of
surprise
in
her
that
gave
him
the
sense
of
her
having
been
plucked
out
of
a
very
maelstrom
the
things
she
took
for
granted
gave
the
measure
of
those
she
had
rebelled
against
archer
had
left
her
with
the
conviction
that
count
olenski
accusation
was
not
unfounded
the
mysterious
person
who
figured
in
his
past
as
the
secretary
had
probably
not
been
unrewarded
for
his
share
in
her
escape
the
conditions
from
which
she
had
fled
were
intolerable
past
speaking
of
past
believing
she
was
young
she
was
frightened
she
was
desperate
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
be
grateful
to
her
rescuer
the
pity
was
that
her
gratitude
put
her
in
the
law
eyes
and
the
world
on
a
par
with
her
abominable
husband
archer
had
made
her
understand
this
as
he
was
bound
to
do
he
had
also
made
her
understand
that
simplehearted
kindly
new
york
on
whose
larger
charity
she
had
apparently
counted
was
precisely
the
place
where
she
could
least
hope
for
indulgence
to
have
to
make
this
fact
plain
to
her
and
to
witness
her
resigned
acceptance
of
it
had
been
intolerably
painful
to
him
he
felt
himself
drawn
to
her
by
obscure
feelings
of
jealousy
and
pity
as
if
her
error
had
put
her
at
his
mercy
humbling
yet
endearing
her
he
was
glad
it
was
to
him
she
had
revealed
her
secret
rather
than
to
the
cold
scrutiny
of
letterblair
or
the
embarrassed
gaze
of
her
family
he
immediately
took
it
upon
himself
to
assure
them
both
that
she
had
given
up
her
idea
of
seeking
a
divorce
basing
her
decision
on
the
fact
that
she
had
understood
the
uselessness
of
the
proceeding
and
with
infinite
relief
they
had
all
turned
their
eyes
from
the
unpleasantness
she
had
spared
them
i
was
sure
newland
would
manage
it
welland
had
said
proudly
of
her
future
and
old
mingott
who
had
summoned
him
for
a
confidential
interview
had
congratulated
him
on
his
cleverness
and
added
impatiently
silly
goose
i
told
her
myself
what
nonsense
it
was
wanting
to
pass
herself
off
as
ellen
mingott
and
an
old
maid
when
she
has
the
luck
to
be
a
married
woman
and
a
countess
these
incidents
had
made
the
memory
of
his
last
talk
with
madame
olenska
so
vivid
to
the
young
man
that
as
the
curtain
fell
on
the
parting
of
the
two
actors
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
stood
up
to
leave
the
theatre
in
doing
so
he
turned
to
the
side
of
the
house
behind
him
and
saw
the
lady
of
whom
he
was
thinking
seated
in
a
box
with
the
beauforts
lawrence
lefferts
and
one
or
two
other
men
he
had
not
spoken
with
her
alone
since
their
evening
together
and
had
tried
to
avoid
being
with
her
in
company
but
now
their
eyes
met
and
as
beaufort
recognised
him
at
the
same
time
and
made
her
languid
little
gesture
of
invitation
it
was
impossible
not
to
go
into
the
box
beaufort
and
lefferts
made
way
for
him
and
after
a
few
words
with
beaufort
who
always
preferred
to
look
beautiful
and
not
have
to
talk
archer
seated
himself
behind
madame
olenska
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
box
but
sillerton
jackson
who
was
telling
beaufort
in
a
confidential
undertone
about
lemuel
struthers
last
sunday
reception
where
some
people
reported
that
there
had
been
dancing
under
cover
of
this
circumstantial
narrative
to
which
beaufort
listened
with
her
perfect
smile
and
her
head
at
just
the
right
angle
to
be
seen
in
profile
from
the
stalls
madame
olenska
turned
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
do
you
think
she
asked
glancing
toward
the
stage
he
will
send
her
a
bunch
of
yellow
roses
tomorrow
morning
archer
reddened
and
his
heart
gave
a
leap
of
surprise
he
had
called
only
twice
on
madame
olenska
and
each
time
he
had
sent
her
a
box
of
yellow
roses
and
each
time
without
a
card
she
had
never
before
made
any
allusion
to
the
flowers
and
he
supposed
she
had
never
thought
of
him
as
the
sender
now
her
sudden
recognition
of
the
gift
and
her
associating
it
with
the
tender
on
the
stage
filled
him
with
an
agitated
pleasure
i
was
thinking
of
that
too
i
was
going
to
leave
the
theatre
in
order
to
take
the
picture
away
with
me
he
said
to
his
surprise
her
colour
rose
reluctantly
and
duskily
she
looked
down
at
the
in
her
smoothly
gloved
hands
and
said
after
a
pause
what
do
you
do
while
may
is
away
i
stick
to
my
work
he
answered
faintly
annoyed
by
the
question
in
obedience
to
a
habit
the
wellands
had
left
the
previous
week
for
augustine
where
out
of
regard
for
the
supposed
susceptibility
of
welland
bronchial
tubes
they
always
spent
the
latter
part
of
the
winter
welland
was
a
mild
and
silent
man
with
no
opinions
but
with
many
habits
with
these
habits
none
might
interfere
and
one
of
them
demanded
that
his
wife
and
daughter
should
always
go
with
him
on
his
annual
journey
to
the
south
to
preserve
an
unbroken
domesticity
was
essential
to
his
peace
of
mind
he
would
not
have
known
where
his
were
or
how
to
provide
stamps
for
his
letters
if
welland
had
not
been
there
to
tell
him
as
all
the
members
of
the
family
adored
each
other
and
as
welland
was
the
central
object
of
their
idolatry
it
never
occurred
to
his
wife
and
may
to
let
him
go
to
augustine
alone
and
his
sons
who
were
both
in
the
law
and
could
not
leave
new
york
during
the
winter
always
joined
him
for
easter
and
travelled
back
with
him
it
was
impossible
for
archer
to
discuss
the
necessity
of
accompanying
her
father
the
reputation
of
the
mingotts
family
physician
was
largely
based
on
the
attack
of
pneumonia
which
welland
had
never
had
and
his
insistence
on
augustine
was
therefore
inflexible
originally
it
had
been
intended
that
engagement
should
not
be
announced
till
her
return
from
florida
and
the
fact
that
it
had
been
made
known
sooner
could
not
be
expected
to
alter
welland
plans
archer
would
have
liked
to
join
the
travellers
and
have
a
few
weeks
of
sunshine
and
boating
with
his
betrothed
but
he
too
was
bound
by
custom
and
conventions
little
arduous
as
his
professional
duties
were
he
would
have
been
convicted
of
frivolity
by
the
whole
mingott
clan
if
he
had
suggested
asking
for
a
holiday
in
and
he
accepted
may
departure
with
the
resignation
which
he
perceived
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
principal
constituents
of
married
life
he
was
conscious
that
madame
olenska
was
looking
at
him
under
lowered
lids
i
have
done
what
you
wished
what
you
advised
she
said
abruptly
ah
i
glad
he
returned
embarrassed
by
her
broaching
the
subject
at
such
a
moment
i
understand
that
you
were
right
she
went
on
a
little
breathlessly
but
sometimes
life
is
difficult
perplexing
i
know
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
do
feel
you
were
right
and
that
grateful
to
you
she
ended
lifting
her
quickly
to
her
eyes
as
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
beaufort
resonant
voice
broke
in
on
them
archer
stood
up
and
left
the
box
and
the
theatre
only
the
day
before
he
had
received
a
letter
from
may
welland
in
which
with
characteristic
candour
she
had
asked
him
to
be
kind
to
ellen
in
their
absence
she
likes
you
and
admires
you
so
much
and
you
know
though
she
does
show
it
she
still
very
lonely
and
unhappy
i
do
think
granny
understands
her
or
uncle
lovell
mingott
either
they
really
think
she
much
worldlier
and
fonder
of
society
than
she
is
and
i
can
quite
see
that
new
york
must
seem
dull
to
her
though
the
family
wo
admit
it
i
think
she
been
used
to
lots
of
things
we
have
got
wonderful
music
and
picture
shows
and
celebrities
artists
and
authors
and
all
the
clever
people
you
admire
granny
ca
understand
her
wanting
anything
but
lots
of
dinners
and
clothes
but
i
can
see
that
you
almost
the
only
person
in
new
york
who
can
talk
to
her
about
what
she
really
cares
for
his
wise
may
how
he
had
loved
her
for
that
letter
but
he
had
not
meant
to
act
on
it
he
was
too
busy
to
begin
with
and
he
did
not
care
as
an
engaged
man
to
play
too
conspicuously
the
part
of
madame
olenska
champion
he
had
an
idea
that
she
knew
how
to
take
care
of
herself
a
good
deal
better
than
the
ingenuous
may
imagined
she
had
beaufort
at
her
feet
van
der
luyden
hovering
above
her
like
a
protecting
deity
and
any
number
of
candidates
lawrence
lefferts
among
them
waiting
their
opportunity
in
the
middle
distance
yet
he
never
saw
her
or
exchanged
a
word
with
her
without
feeling
that
after
all
may
ingenuousness
almost
amounted
to
a
gift
of
divination
ellen
olenska
was
lonely
and
she
was
unhappy
xiv
as
he
came
out
into
the
lobby
archer
ran
across
his
friend
ned
winsett
the
only
one
among
what
janey
called
his
clever
people
with
whom
he
cared
to
probe
into
things
a
little
deeper
than
the
average
level
of
club
and
banter
he
had
caught
sight
across
the
house
of
winsett
shabby
back
and
had
once
noticed
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
beaufort
box
the
two
men
shook
hands
and
winsett
proposed
a
bock
at
a
little
german
restaurant
around
the
corner
archer
who
was
not
in
the
mood
for
the
kind
of
talk
they
were
likely
to
get
there
declined
on
the
plea
that
he
had
work
to
do
at
home
and
winsett
said
oh
well
so
have
i
for
that
matter
and
i
be
the
industrious
apprentice
too
they
strolled
along
together
and
presently
winsett
said
look
here
what
i
really
after
is
the
name
of
the
dark
lady
in
that
swell
box
of
yours
with
the
beauforts
was
she
the
one
your
friend
lefferts
seems
so
smitten
by
archer
he
could
not
have
said
why
was
slightly
annoyed
what
the
devil
did
ned
winsett
want
with
ellen
olenska
name
and
above
all
why
did
he
couple
it
with
lefferts
it
was
unlike
winsett
to
manifest
such
curiosity
but
after
all
archer
remembered
he
was
a
journalist
it
not
for
an
interview
i
hope
he
laughed
well
not
for
the
press
just
for
myself
winsett
rejoined
the
fact
is
she
a
neighbour
of
mine
queer
quarter
for
such
a
beauty
to
settle
in
and
she
been
awfully
kind
to
my
little
boy
who
fell
down
her
area
chasing
his
kitten
and
gave
himself
a
nasty
cut
she
rushed
in
bareheaded
carrying
him
in
her
arms
with
his
knee
all
beautifully
bandaged
and
was
so
sympathetic
and
beautiful
that
my
wife
was
too
dazzled
to
ask
her
name
a
pleasant
glow
dilated
archer
heart
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
tale
any
woman
would
have
done
as
much
for
a
neighbour
child
but
it
was
just
like
ellen
he
felt
to
have
rushed
in
bareheaded
carrying
the
boy
in
her
arms
and
to
have
dazzled
poor
winsett
into
forgetting
to
ask
who
she
was
that
is
the
countess
olenska
a
granddaughter
of
old
mrs
mingott
whew
a
countess
whistled
ned
winsett
well
i
did
know
countesses
were
so
neighbourly
mingotts
ai
they
would
be
if
you
let
them
ah
well
it
was
their
old
interminable
argument
as
to
the
obstinate
unwillingness
of
the
clever
people
to
frequent
the
fashionable
and
both
men
knew
that
there
was
no
use
in
prolonging
it
i
wonder
winsett
broke
off
how
a
countess
happens
to
live
in
our
slum
because
she
does
care
a
hang
about
where
she
lives
or
about
any
of
our
little
social
said
archer
with
a
secret
pride
in
his
own
picture
of
her
h
been
in
bigger
places
i
suppose
the
other
commented
well
here
my
corner
he
slouched
off
across
broadway
and
archer
stood
looking
after
him
and
musing
on
his
last
words
ned
winsett
had
those
flashes
of
penetration
they
were
the
most
interesting
thing
about
him
and
always
made
archer
wonder
why
they
had
allowed
him
to
accept
failure
so
stolidly
at
an
age
when
most
men
are
still
struggling
archer
had
known
that
winsett
had
a
wife
and
child
but
he
had
never
seen
them
the
two
men
always
met
at
the
century
or
at
some
haunt
of
journalists
and
theatrical
people
such
as
the
restaurant
where
winsett
had
proposed
to
go
for
a
bock
he
had
given
archer
to
understand
that
his
wife
was
an
invalid
which
might
be
true
of
the
poor
lady
or
might
merely
mean
that
she
was
lacking
in
social
gifts
or
in
evening
clothes
or
in
both
winsett
himself
had
a
savage
abhorrence
of
social
observances
archer
who
dressed
in
the
evening
because
he
thought
it
cleaner
and
more
comfortable
to
do
so
and
who
had
never
stopped
to
consider
that
cleanliness
and
comfort
are
two
of
the
costliest
items
in
a
modest
budget
regarded
winsett
attitude
as
part
of
the
boring
bohemian
pose
that
always
made
fashionable
people
who
changed
their
clothes
without
talking
about
it
and
were
not
forever
harping
on
the
number
of
servants
one
kept
seem
so
much
simpler
and
less
than
the
others
nevertheless
he
was
always
stimulated
by
winsett
and
whenever
he
caught
sight
of
the
journalist
lean
bearded
face
and
melancholy
eyes
he
would
rout
him
out
of
his
corner
and
carry
him
off
for
a
long
talk
winsett
was
not
a
journalist
by
choice
he
was
a
pure
man
of
letters
untimely
born
in
a
world
that
had
no
need
of
letters
but
after
publishing
one
volume
of
brief
and
exquisite
literary
appreciations
of
which
one
hundred
and
twenty
copies
were
sold
thirty
given
away
and
the
balance
eventually
destroyed
by
the
publishers
as
per
contract
to
make
room
for
more
marketable
material
he
had
abandoned
his
real
calling
and
taken
a
job
on
a
women
weekly
where
and
paper
patterns
alternated
with
new
england
and
advertisements
of
temperance
drinks
on
the
subject
of
as
the
paper
was
called
he
was
inexhaustibly
entertaining
but
beneath
his
fun
lurked
the
sterile
bitterness
of
the
still
young
man
who
has
tried
and
given
up
his
conversation
always
made
archer
take
the
measure
of
his
own
life
and
feel
how
little
it
contained
but
winsett
after
all
contained
still
less
and
though
their
common
fund
of
intellectual
interests
and
curiosities
made
their
talks
exhilarating
their
exchange
of
views
usually
remained
within
the
limits
of
a
pensive
dilettantism
the
fact
is
life
is
much
a
fit
for
either
of
us
winsett
had
once
said
i
down
and
out
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
i
got
only
one
ware
to
produce
and
there
no
market
for
it
here
and
wo
be
in
my
time
but
you
free
and
you
why
do
you
get
into
touch
there
only
one
way
to
do
it
to
go
into
politics
archer
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
there
one
saw
at
a
flash
the
unbridgeable
difference
between
men
like
winsett
and
the
others
archer
kind
every
one
in
polite
circles
knew
that
in
america
a
gentleman
could
go
into
politics
but
since
he
could
hardly
put
it
in
that
way
to
winsett
he
answered
evasively
look
at
the
career
of
the
honest
man
in
american
politics
they
do
want
us
who
why
do
you
all
get
together
and
be
yourselves
archer
laugh
lingered
on
his
lips
in
a
slightly
condescending
smile
it
was
useless
to
prolong
the
discussion
everybody
knew
the
melancholy
fate
of
the
few
gentlemen
who
had
risked
their
clean
linen
in
municipal
or
state
politics
in
new
york
the
day
was
past
when
that
sort
of
thing
was
possible
the
country
was
in
possession
of
the
bosses
and
the
emigrant
and
decent
people
had
to
fall
back
on
sport
or
culture
culture
yes
if
we
had
it
but
there
are
just
a
few
little
local
patches
dying
out
here
and
there
for
lack
of
well
hoeing
and
the
last
remnants
of
the
old
european
tradition
that
your
forebears
brought
with
them
but
you
in
a
pitiful
little
minority
you
got
no
centre
no
competition
no
audience
like
the
pictures
on
the
walls
of
a
deserted
house
portrait
of
a
gentleman
you
never
amount
to
anything
any
of
you
till
you
roll
up
your
sleeves
and
get
right
down
into
the
muck
that
or
emigrate
god
if
i
could
emigrate
archer
mentally
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
the
conversation
back
to
books
where
winsett
if
uncertain
was
always
interesting
emigrate
as
if
a
gentleman
could
abandon
his
own
country
one
could
no
more
do
that
than
one
could
roll
up
one
sleeves
and
go
down
into
the
muck
a
gentleman
simply
stayed
at
home
and
abstained
but
you
could
make
a
man
like
winsett
see
that
and
that
was
why
the
new
york
of
literary
clubs
and
exotic
restaurants
though
a
first
shake
made
it
seem
more
of
a
kaleidoscope
turned
out
in
the
end
to
be
a
smaller
box
with
a
more
monotonous
pattern
than
the
assembled
atoms
of
fifth
avenue
the
next
morning
archer
scoured
the
town
in
vain
for
more
yellow
roses
in
consequence
of
this
search
he
arrived
late
at
the
office
perceived
that
his
doing
so
made
no
difference
whatever
to
any
one
and
was
filled
with
sudden
exasperation
at
the
elaborate
futility
of
his
life
why
should
he
not
be
at
that
moment
on
the
sands
of
augustine
with
may
welland
no
one
was
deceived
by
his
pretense
of
professional
activity
in
legal
firms
like
that
of
which
letterblair
was
the
head
and
which
were
mainly
engaged
in
the
management
of
large
estates
and
conservative
investments
there
were
always
two
or
three
young
men
fairly
and
without
professional
ambition
who
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
each
day
sat
at
their
desks
accomplishing
trivial
tasks
or
simply
reading
the
newspapers
though
it
was
supposed
to
be
proper
for
them
to
have
an
occupation
the
crude
fact
of
was
still
regarded
as
derogatory
and
the
law
being
a
profession
was
accounted
a
more
gentlemanly
pursuit
than
business
but
none
of
these
young
men
had
much
hope
of
really
advancing
in
his
profession
or
any
earnest
desire
to
do
so
and
over
many
of
them
the
green
mould
of
the
perfunctory
was
already
perceptibly
spreading
it
made
archer
shiver
to
think
that
it
might
be
spreading
over
him
too
he
had
to
be
sure
other
tastes
and
interests
he
spent
his
vacations
in
european
travel
cultivated
the
clever
people
may
spoke
of
and
generally
tried
to
keep
up
as
he
had
somewhat
wistfully
put
it
to
madame
olenska
but
once
he
was
married
what
would
become
of
this
narrow
margin
of
life
in
which
his
real
experiences
were
lived
he
had
seen
enough
of
other
young
men
who
had
dreamed
his
dream
though
perhaps
less
ardently
and
who
had
gradually
sunk
into
the
placid
and
luxurious
routine
of
their
elders
from
the
office
he
sent
a
note
by
messenger
to
madame
olenska
asking
if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
and
begging
her
to
let
him
find
a
reply
at
his
club
but
at
the
club
he
found
nothing
nor
did
he
receive
any
letter
the
following
day
this
unexpected
silence
mortified
him
beyond
reason
and
though
the
next
morning
he
saw
a
glorious
cluster
of
yellow
roses
behind
a
florist
he
left
it
there
it
was
only
on
the
third
morning
that
he
received
a
line
by
post
from
the
countess
olenska
to
his
surprise
it
was
dated
from
skuytercliff
whither
the
van
der
luydens
had
promptly
retreated
after
putting
the
duke
on
board
his
steamer
i
ran
away
the
writer
began
abruptly
without
the
usual
preliminaries
the
day
after
i
saw
you
at
the
play
and
these
kind
friends
have
taken
me
in
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
think
things
over
you
were
right
in
telling
me
how
kind
they
were
i
feel
myself
so
safe
here
i
wish
that
you
were
with
us
she
ended
with
a
conventional
yours
sincerely
and
without
any
allusion
to
the
date
of
her
return
the
tone
of
the
note
surprised
the
young
man
what
was
madame
olenska
running
away
from
and
why
did
she
feel
the
need
to
be
safe
his
first
thought
was
of
some
dark
menace
from
abroad
then
he
reflected
that
he
did
not
know
her
epistolary
style
and
that
it
might
run
to
picturesque
exaggeration
women
always
exaggerated
and
moreover
she
was
not
wholly
at
her
ease
in
english
which
she
often
spoke
as
if
she
were
translating
from
the
french
je
me
suis
evadee
put
in
that
way
the
opening
sentence
immediately
suggested
that
she
might
merely
have
wanted
to
escape
from
a
boring
round
of
engagements
which
was
very
likely
true
for
he
judged
her
to
be
capricious
and
easily
wearied
of
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
it
amused
him
to
think
of
the
van
der
luydens
having
carried
her
off
to
skuytercliff
on
a
second
visit
and
this
time
for
an
indefinite
period
the
doors
of
skuytercliff
were
rarely
and
grudgingly
opened
to
visitors
and
a
chilly
was
the
most
ever
offered
to
the
few
thus
privileged
but
archer
had
seen
on
his
last
visit
to
paris
the
delicious
play
of
labiche
le
voyage
de
perrichon
and
he
remembered
perrichon
dogged
and
undiscouraged
attachment
to
the
young
man
whom
he
had
pulled
out
of
the
glacier
the
van
der
luydens
had
rescued
madame
olenska
from
a
doom
almost
as
icy
and
though
there
were
many
other
reasons
for
being
attracted
to
her
archer
knew
that
beneath
them
all
lay
the
gentle
and
obstinate
determination
to
go
on
rescuing
her
he
felt
a
distinct
disappointment
on
learning
that
she
was
away
and
almost
immediately
remembered
that
only
the
day
before
he
had
refused
an
invitation
to
spend
the
following
sunday
with
the
reggie
chiverses
at
their
house
on
the
hudson
a
few
miles
below
skuytercliff
he
had
had
his
fill
long
ago
of
the
noisy
friendly
parties
at
highbank
with
coasting
sleighing
long
tramps
in
the
snow
and
a
general
flavour
of
mild
flirting
and
milder
practical
jokes
he
had
just
received
a
box
of
new
books
from
his
london
and
had
preferred
the
prospect
of
a
quiet
sunday
at
home
with
his
spoils
but
he
now
went
into
the
club
wrote
a
hurried
telegram
and
told
the
servant
to
send
it
immediately
he
knew
that
reggie
did
object
to
her
visitors
suddenly
changing
their
minds
and
that
there
was
always
a
room
to
spare
in
her
elastic
house
xv
newland
archer
arrived
at
the
chiverses
on
friday
evening
and
on
saturday
went
conscientiously
through
all
the
rites
appertaining
to
a
at
highbank
in
the
morning
he
had
a
spin
in
the
with
his
hostess
and
a
few
of
the
hardier
guests
in
the
afternoon
he
went
over
the
farm
with
reggie
and
listened
in
the
elaborately
appointed
stables
to
long
and
impressive
disquisitions
on
the
horse
after
tea
he
talked
in
a
corner
of
the
firelit
hall
with
a
young
lady
who
had
professed
herself
when
his
engagement
was
announced
but
was
now
eager
to
tell
him
of
her
own
matrimonial
hopes
and
finally
about
midnight
he
assisted
in
putting
a
in
one
visitor
bed
dressed
up
a
burglar
in
the
of
a
nervous
aunt
and
saw
in
the
small
hours
by
joining
in
a
that
ranged
from
the
nurseries
to
the
basement
but
on
sunday
after
luncheon
he
borrowed
a
cutter
and
drove
over
to
skuytercliff
people
had
always
been
told
that
the
house
at
skuytercliff
was
an
italian
villa
those
who
had
never
been
to
italy
believed
it
so
did
some
who
had
the
house
had
been
built
by
van
der
luyden
in
his
youth
on
his
return
from
the
grand
tour
and
in
anticipation
of
his
approaching
marriage
with
miss
louisa
dagonet
it
was
a
large
square
wooden
structure
with
tongued
and
grooved
walls
painted
pale
green
and
white
a
corinthian
portico
and
fluted
pilasters
between
the
windows
from
the
high
ground
on
which
it
stood
a
series
of
terraces
bordered
by
balustrades
and
urns
descended
in
the
style
to
a
small
irregular
lake
with
an
asphalt
edge
overhung
by
rare
weeping
conifers
to
the
right
and
left
the
famous
weedless
lawns
studded
with
specimen
trees
each
of
a
different
variety
rolled
away
to
long
ranges
of
grass
crested
with
elaborate
ornaments
and
below
in
a
hollow
lay
the
stone
house
which
the
first
patroon
had
built
on
the
land
granted
him
in
against
the
uniform
sheet
of
snow
and
the
greyish
winter
sky
the
italian
villa
loomed
up
rather
grimly
even
in
summer
it
kept
its
distance
and
the
boldest
coleus
bed
had
never
ventured
nearer
than
thirty
feet
from
its
awful
front
now
as
archer
rang
the
bell
the
long
tinkle
seemed
to
echo
through
a
mausoleum
and
the
surprise
of
the
butler
who
at
length
responded
to
the
call
was
as
great
as
though
he
had
been
summoned
from
his
final
sleep
happily
archer
was
of
the
family
and
therefore
irregular
though
his
arrival
was
entitled
to
be
informed
that
the
countess
olenska
was
out
having
driven
to
afternoon
service
with
van
der
luyden
exactly
three
quarters
of
an
hour
earlier
van
der
luyden
the
butler
continued
is
in
sir
but
my
impression
is
that
he
is
either
finishing
his
nap
or
else
reading
yesterday
evening
post
i
heard
him
say
sir
on
his
return
from
church
this
morning
that
he
intended
to
look
through
the
evening
post
after
luncheon
if
you
like
sir
i
might
go
to
the
library
door
and
listen
but
archer
thanking
him
said
that
he
would
go
and
meet
the
ladies
and
the
butler
obviously
relieved
closed
the
door
on
him
majestically
a
groom
took
the
cutter
to
the
stables
and
archer
struck
through
the
park
to
the
the
village
of
skuytercliff
was
only
a
mile
and
a
half
away
but
he
knew
that
van
der
luyden
never
walked
and
that
he
must
keep
to
the
road
to
meet
the
carriage
presently
however
coming
down
a
that
crossed
the
highway
he
caught
sight
of
a
slight
figure
in
a
red
cloak
with
a
big
dog
running
ahead
he
hurried
forward
and
madame
olenska
stopped
short
with
a
smile
of
welcome
ah
you
come
she
said
and
drew
her
hand
from
her
muff
the
red
cloak
made
her
look
gay
and
vivid
like
the
ellen
mingott
of
old
days
and
he
laughed
as
he
took
her
hand
and
answered
i
came
to
see
what
you
were
running
away
from
her
face
clouded
over
but
she
answered
ah
well
you
will
see
presently
the
answer
puzzled
him
why
do
you
mean
that
you
been
overtaken
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
little
movement
like
nastasia
and
rejoined
in
a
lighter
tone
shall
we
walk
on
i
so
cold
after
the
sermon
and
what
does
it
matter
now
you
here
to
protect
me
the
blood
rose
to
his
temples
and
he
caught
a
fold
of
her
cloak
ellen
what
is
it
you
must
tell
me
oh
presently
let
run
a
race
first
my
feet
are
freezing
to
the
ground
she
cried
and
gathering
up
the
cloak
she
fled
away
across
the
snow
the
dog
leaping
about
her
with
challenging
barks
for
a
moment
archer
stood
watching
his
gaze
delighted
by
the
flash
of
the
red
meteor
against
the
snow
then
he
started
after
her
and
they
met
panting
and
laughing
at
a
wicket
that
led
into
the
park
she
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
i
knew
you
come
that
shows
you
wanted
me
to
he
returned
with
a
disproportionate
joy
in
their
nonsense
the
white
glitter
of
the
trees
filled
the
air
with
its
own
mysterious
brightness
and
as
they
walked
on
over
the
snow
the
ground
seemed
to
sing
under
their
feet
where
did
you
come
from
madame
olenska
asked
he
told
her
and
added
it
was
because
i
got
your
note
after
a
pause
she
said
with
a
just
perceptible
chill
in
her
voice
may
asked
you
to
take
care
of
me
i
did
need
any
asking
you
mean
i
so
evidently
helpless
and
defenceless
what
a
poor
thing
you
must
all
think
me
but
women
here
seem
not
seem
never
to
feel
the
need
any
more
than
the
blessed
in
heaven
he
lowered
his
voice
to
ask
what
sort
of
a
need
ah
do
ask
me
i
do
speak
your
language
she
retorted
petulantly
the
answer
smote
him
like
a
blow
and
he
stood
still
in
the
path
looking
down
at
her
what
did
i
come
for
if
i
do
speak
yours
oh
my
friend
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
and
he
pleaded
earnestly
ellen
why
wo
you
tell
me
what
happened
she
shrugged
again
does
anything
ever
happen
in
heaven
he
was
silent
and
they
walked
on
a
few
yards
without
exchanging
a
word
finally
she
said
i
will
tell
you
but
where
where
where
one
ca
be
alone
for
a
minute
in
that
great
seminary
of
a
house
with
all
the
doors
wide
open
and
always
a
servant
bringing
tea
or
a
log
for
the
fire
or
the
newspaper
is
there
nowhere
in
an
american
house
where
one
may
be
by
one
self
you
so
shy
and
yet
you
so
public
i
always
feel
as
if
i
were
in
the
convent
again
or
on
the
stage
before
a
dreadfully
polite
audience
that
never
applauds
ah
you
do
like
us
archer
exclaimed
they
were
walking
past
the
house
of
the
old
patroon
with
its
squat
walls
and
small
square
windows
compactly
grouped
about
a
central
chimney
the
shutters
stood
wide
and
through
one
of
the
windows
archer
caught
the
light
of
a
fire
why
the
house
is
open
he
said
she
stood
still
no
only
for
today
at
least
i
wanted
to
see
it
and
van
der
luyden
had
the
fire
lit
and
the
windows
opened
so
that
we
might
stop
there
on
the
way
back
from
church
this
morning
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
tried
the
door
it
still
unlocked
what
luck
come
in
and
we
can
have
a
quiet
talk
van
der
luyden
has
driven
over
to
see
her
old
aunts
at
rhinebeck
and
we
sha
be
missed
at
the
house
for
another
hour
he
followed
her
into
the
narrow
passage
his
spirits
which
had
dropped
at
her
last
words
rose
with
an
irrational
leap
the
homely
little
house
stood
there
its
panels
and
brasses
shining
in
the
firelight
as
if
magically
created
to
receive
them
a
big
bed
of
embers
still
gleamed
in
the
kitchen
chimney
under
an
iron
pot
hung
from
an
ancient
crane
faced
each
other
across
the
tiled
hearth
and
rows
of
delft
plates
stood
on
shelves
against
the
walls
archer
stooped
over
and
threw
a
log
upon
the
embers
madame
olenska
dropping
her
cloak
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
archer
leaned
against
the
chimney
and
looked
at
her
you
laughing
now
but
when
you
wrote
me
you
were
unhappy
he
said
yes
she
paused
but
i
ca
feel
unhappy
when
you
here
i
be
here
long
he
rejoined
his
lips
stiffening
with
the
effort
to
say
just
so
much
and
no
more
no
i
know
but
i
improvident
i
live
in
the
moment
when
i
happy
the
words
stole
through
him
like
a
temptation
and
to
close
his
senses
to
it
he
moved
away
from
the
hearth
and
stood
gazing
out
at
the
black
against
the
snow
but
it
was
as
if
she
too
had
shifted
her
place
and
he
still
saw
her
between
himself
and
the
trees
drooping
over
the
fire
with
her
indolent
smile
archer
heart
was
beating
insubordinately
what
if
it
were
from
him
that
she
had
been
running
away
and
if
she
had
waited
to
tell
him
so
till
they
were
here
alone
together
in
this
secret
room
ellen
if
i
really
a
help
to
you
if
you
really
wanted
me
to
come
tell
me
what
wrong
tell
me
what
it
is
you
running
away
from
he
insisted
he
spoke
without
shifting
his
position
without
even
turning
to
look
at
her
if
the
thing
was
to
happen
it
was
to
happen
in
this
way
with
the
whole
width
of
the
room
between
them
and
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
outer
snow
for
a
long
moment
she
was
silent
and
in
that
moment
archer
imagined
her
almost
heard
her
stealing
up
behind
him
to
throw
her
light
arms
about
his
neck
while
he
waited
soul
and
body
throbbing
with
the
miracle
to
come
his
eyes
mechanically
received
the
image
of
a
man
with
his
fur
collar
turned
up
who
was
advancing
along
the
path
to
the
house
the
man
was
julius
beaufort
ah
archer
cried
bursting
into
a
laugh
madame
olenska
had
sprung
up
and
moved
to
his
side
slipping
her
hand
into
his
but
after
a
glance
through
the
window
her
face
paled
and
she
shrank
back
so
that
was
it
archer
said
derisively
i
did
know
he
was
here
madame
olenska
murmured
her
hand
still
clung
to
archer
but
he
drew
away
from
her
and
walking
out
into
the
passage
threw
open
the
door
of
the
house
hallo
beaufort
this
way
madame
olenska
was
expecting
you
he
said
during
his
journey
back
to
new
york
the
next
morning
archer
relived
with
a
fatiguing
vividness
his
last
moments
at
skuytercliff
beaufort
though
clearly
annoyed
at
finding
him
with
madame
olenska
had
as
usual
carried
off
the
situation
his
way
of
ignoring
people
whose
presence
inconvenienced
him
actually
gave
them
if
they
were
sensitive
to
it
a
feeling
of
invisibility
of
nonexistence
archer
as
the
three
strolled
back
through
the
park
was
aware
of
this
odd
sense
of
disembodiment
and
humbling
as
it
was
to
his
vanity
it
gave
him
the
ghostly
advantage
of
observing
unobserved
beaufort
had
entered
the
little
house
with
his
usual
easy
assurance
but
he
could
not
smile
away
the
vertical
line
between
his
eyes
it
was
fairly
clear
that
madame
olenska
had
not
known
that
he
was
coming
though
her
words
to
archer
had
hinted
at
the
possibility
at
any
rate
she
had
evidently
not
told
him
where
she
was
going
when
she
left
new
york
and
her
unexplained
departure
had
exasperated
him
the
ostensible
reason
of
his
appearance
was
the
discovery
the
very
night
before
of
a
perfect
little
house
not
in
the
market
which
was
really
just
the
thing
for
her
but
would
be
snapped
up
instantly
if
she
did
take
it
and
he
was
loud
in
for
the
dance
she
had
led
him
in
running
away
just
as
he
had
found
it
if
only
this
new
dodge
for
talking
along
a
wire
had
been
a
little
bit
nearer
perfection
i
might
have
told
you
all
this
from
town
and
been
toasting
my
toes
before
the
club
fire
at
this
minute
instead
of
tramping
after
you
through
the
snow
he
grumbled
disguising
a
real
irritation
under
the
pretence
of
it
and
at
this
opening
madame
olenska
twisted
the
talk
away
to
the
fantastic
possibility
that
they
might
one
day
actually
converse
with
each
other
from
street
to
street
or
even
incredible
dream
from
one
town
to
another
this
struck
from
all
three
allusions
to
edgar
poe
and
jules
verne
and
such
platitudes
as
naturally
rise
to
the
lips
of
the
most
intelligent
when
they
are
talking
against
time
and
dealing
with
a
new
invention
in
which
it
would
seem
ingenuous
to
believe
too
soon
and
the
question
of
the
telephone
carried
them
safely
back
to
the
big
house
van
der
luyden
had
not
yet
returned
and
archer
took
his
leave
and
walked
off
to
fetch
the
cutter
while
beaufort
followed
the
countess
olenska
indoors
it
was
probable
that
little
as
the
van
der
luydens
encouraged
unannounced
visits
he
could
count
on
being
asked
to
dine
and
sent
back
to
the
station
to
catch
the
nine
train
but
more
than
that
he
would
certainly
not
get
for
it
would
be
inconceivable
to
his
hosts
that
a
gentleman
travelling
without
luggage
should
wish
to
spend
the
night
and
distasteful
to
them
to
propose
it
to
a
person
with
whom
they
were
on
terms
of
such
limited
cordiality
as
beaufort
beaufort
knew
all
this
and
must
have
foreseen
it
and
his
taking
the
long
journey
for
so
small
a
reward
gave
the
measure
of
his
impatience
he
was
undeniably
in
pursuit
of
the
countess
olenska
and
beaufort
had
only
one
object
in
view
in
his
pursuit
of
pretty
women
his
dull
and
childless
home
had
long
since
palled
on
him
and
in
addition
to
more
permanent
consolations
he
was
always
in
quest
of
amorous
adventures
in
his
own
set
this
was
the
man
from
whom
madame
olenska
was
avowedly
flying
the
question
was
whether
she
had
fled
because
his
importunities
displeased
her
or
because
she
did
not
wholly
trust
herself
to
resist
them
unless
indeed
all
her
talk
of
flight
had
been
a
blind
and
her
departure
no
more
than
a
manoeuvre
archer
did
not
really
believe
this
little
as
he
had
actually
seen
of
madame
olenska
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
could
read
her
face
and
if
not
her
face
her
voice
and
both
had
betrayed
annoyance
and
even
dismay
at
beaufort
sudden
appearance
but
after
all
if
this
were
the
case
was
it
not
worse
than
if
she
had
left
new
york
for
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
him
if
she
had
done
that
she
ceased
to
be
an
object
of
interest
she
threw
in
her
lot
with
the
vulgarest
of
dissemblers
a
woman
engaged
in
a
love
affair
with
beaufort
classed
herself
irretrievably
no
it
was
worse
a
thousand
times
if
judging
beaufort
and
probably
despising
him
she
was
yet
drawn
to
him
by
all
that
gave
him
an
advantage
over
the
other
men
about
her
his
habit
of
two
continents
and
two
societies
his
familiar
association
with
artists
and
actors
and
people
generally
in
the
world
eye
and
his
careless
contempt
for
local
prejudices
beaufort
was
vulgar
he
was
uneducated
he
was
but
the
circumstances
of
his
life
and
a
certain
native
shrewdness
made
him
better
worth
talking
to
than
many
men
morally
and
socially
his
betters
whose
horizon
was
bounded
by
the
battery
and
the
central
park
how
should
any
one
coming
from
a
wider
world
not
feel
the
difference
and
be
attracted
by
it
madame
olenska
in
a
burst
of
irritation
had
said
to
archer
that
he
and
she
did
not
talk
the
same
language
and
the
young
man
knew
that
in
some
respects
this
was
true
but
beaufort
understood
every
turn
of
her
dialect
and
spoke
it
fluently
his
view
of
life
his
tone
his
attitude
were
merely
a
coarser
reflection
of
those
revealed
in
count
olenski
letter
this
might
seem
to
be
to
his
disadvantage
with
count
olenski
wife
but
archer
was
too
intelligent
to
think
that
a
young
woman
like
ellen
olenska
would
necessarily
recoil
from
everything
that
reminded
her
of
her
past
she
might
believe
herself
wholly
in
revolt
against
it
but
what
had
charmed
her
in
it
would
still
charm
her
even
though
it
were
against
her
will
thus
with
a
painful
impartiality
did
the
young
man
make
out
the
case
for
beaufort
and
for
beaufort
victim
a
longing
to
enlighten
her
was
strong
in
him
and
there
were
moments
when
he
imagined
that
all
she
asked
was
to
be
enlightened
that
evening
he
unpacked
his
books
from
london
the
box
was
full
of
things
he
had
been
waiting
for
impatiently
a
new
volume
of
herbert
spencer
another
collection
of
the
prolific
alphonse
daudet
brilliant
tales
and
a
novel
called
middlemarch
as
to
which
there
had
lately
been
interesting
things
said
in
the
reviews
he
had
declined
three
dinner
invitations
in
favour
of
this
feast
but
though
he
turned
the
pages
with
the
sensuous
joy
of
the
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
reading
and
one
book
after
another
dropped
from
his
hand
suddenly
among
them
he
lit
on
a
small
volume
of
verse
which
he
had
ordered
because
the
name
had
attracted
him
the
house
of
life
he
took
it
up
and
found
himself
plunged
in
an
atmosphere
unlike
any
he
had
ever
breathed
in
books
so
warm
so
rich
and
yet
so
ineffably
tender
that
it
gave
a
new
and
haunting
beauty
to
the
most
elementary
of
human
passions
all
through
the
night
he
pursued
through
those
enchanted
pages
the
vision
of
a
woman
who
had
the
face
of
ellen
olenska
but
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
and
looked
out
at
the
brownstone
houses
across
the
street
and
thought
of
his
desk
in
letterblair
office
and
the
family
pew
in
grace
church
his
hour
in
the
park
of
skuytercliff
became
as
far
outside
the
pale
of
probability
as
the
visions
of
the
night
mercy
how
pale
you
look
newland
janey
commented
over
the
at
breakfast
and
his
mother
added
newland
dear
noticed
lately
that
you
been
coughing
i
do
hope
you
not
letting
yourself
be
overworked
for
it
was
the
conviction
of
both
ladies
that
under
the
iron
despotism
of
his
senior
partners
the
young
life
was
spent
in
the
most
exhausting
professional
labours
and
he
had
never
thought
it
necessary
to
undeceive
them
the
next
two
or
three
days
dragged
by
heavily
the
taste
of
the
usual
was
like
cinders
in
his
mouth
and
there
were
moments
when
he
felt
as
if
he
were
being
buried
alive
under
his
future
he
heard
nothing
of
the
countess
olenska
or
of
the
perfect
little
house
and
though
he
met
beaufort
at
the
club
they
merely
nodded
at
each
other
across
the
it
was
not
till
the
fourth
evening
that
he
found
a
note
awaiting
him
on
his
return
home
come
late
tomorrow
i
must
explain
to
you
ellen
these
were
the
only
words
it
contained
the
young
man
who
was
dining
out
thrust
the
note
into
his
pocket
smiling
a
little
at
the
frenchness
of
the
to
you
after
dinner
he
went
to
a
play
and
it
was
not
until
his
return
home
after
midnight
that
he
drew
madame
olenska
missive
out
again
and
it
slowly
a
number
of
times
there
were
several
ways
of
answering
it
and
he
gave
considerable
thought
to
each
one
during
the
watches
of
an
agitated
night
that
on
which
when
morning
came
he
finally
decided
was
to
pitch
some
clothes
into
a
portmanteau
and
jump
on
board
a
boat
that
was
leaving
that
very
afternoon
for
augustine
xvi
when
archer
walked
down
the
sandy
main
street
of
augustine
to
the
house
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
as
welland
and
saw
may
welland
standing
under
a
magnolia
with
the
sun
in
her
hair
he
wondered
why
he
had
waited
so
long
to
come
here
was
the
truth
here
was
reality
here
was
the
life
that
belonged
to
him
and
he
who
fancied
himself
so
scornful
of
arbitrary
restraints
had
been
afraid
to
break
away
from
his
desk
because
of
what
people
might
think
of
his
stealing
a
holiday
her
first
exclamation
was
newland
has
anything
happened
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
have
been
more
feminine
if
she
had
instantly
read
in
his
eyes
why
he
had
come
but
when
he
answered
yes
i
found
i
had
to
see
you
her
happy
blushes
took
the
chill
from
her
surprise
and
he
saw
how
easily
he
would
be
forgiven
and
how
soon
even
letterblair
mild
disapproval
would
be
smiled
away
by
a
tolerant
family
early
as
it
was
the
main
street
was
no
place
for
any
but
formal
greetings
and
archer
longed
to
be
alone
with
may
and
to
pour
out
all
his
tenderness
and
his
impatience
it
still
lacked
an
hour
to
the
late
welland
and
instead
of
asking
him
to
come
in
she
proposed
that
they
should
walk
out
to
an
old
beyond
the
town
she
had
just
been
for
a
row
on
the
river
and
the
sun
that
netted
the
little
waves
with
gold
seemed
to
have
caught
her
in
its
meshes
across
the
warm
brown
of
her
cheek
her
blown
hair
glittered
like
silver
wire
and
her
eyes
too
looked
lighter
almost
pale
in
their
youthful
limpidity
as
she
walked
beside
archer
with
her
long
swinging
gait
her
face
wore
the
vacant
serenity
of
a
young
marble
athlete
to
archer
strained
nerves
the
vision
was
as
soothing
as
the
sight
of
the
blue
sky
and
the
lazy
river
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
under
the
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
it
was
like
drinking
at
a
cold
spring
with
the
sun
on
it
but
his
pressure
may
have
been
more
vehement
than
he
had
intended
for
the
blood
rose
to
her
face
and
she
drew
back
as
if
he
had
startled
her
what
is
it
he
asked
smiling
and
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
answered
nothing
a
slight
embarrassment
fell
on
them
and
her
hand
slipped
out
of
his
it
was
the
only
time
that
he
had
kissed
her
on
the
lips
except
for
their
fugitive
embrace
in
the
beaufort
conservatory
and
he
saw
that
she
was
disturbed
and
shaken
out
of
her
cool
boyish
composure
tell
me
what
you
do
all
day
he
said
crossing
his
arms
under
his
head
and
pushing
his
hat
forward
to
screen
the
to
let
her
talk
about
familiar
and
simple
things
was
the
easiest
way
of
carrying
on
his
own
independent
train
of
thought
and
he
sat
listening
to
her
simple
chronicle
of
swimming
sailing
and
riding
varied
by
an
occasional
dance
at
the
primitive
inn
when
a
came
in
a
few
pleasant
people
from
philadelphia
and
baltimore
were
picknicking
at
the
inn
and
the
selfridge
merrys
had
come
down
for
three
weeks
because
kate
merry
had
had
bronchitis
they
were
planning
to
lay
out
a
lawn
tennis
court
on
the
sands
but
no
one
but
kate
and
may
had
racquets
and
most
of
the
people
had
not
even
heard
of
the
game
all
this
kept
her
very
busy
and
she
had
not
had
time
to
do
more
than
look
at
the
little
vellum
book
that
archer
had
sent
her
the
week
before
the
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
but
she
was
learning
by
heart
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
things
he
had
ever
read
to
her
and
it
amused
her
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
kate
merry
had
never
even
heard
of
a
poet
called
robert
browning
presently
she
started
up
exclaiming
that
they
would
be
late
for
breakfast
and
they
hurried
back
to
the
house
with
its
pointless
porch
and
unpruned
hedge
of
plumbago
and
pink
geraniums
where
the
wellands
were
installed
for
the
winter
welland
sensitive
domesticity
shrank
from
the
discomforts
of
the
slovenly
southern
hotel
and
at
immense
expense
and
in
face
of
almost
insuperable
difficulties
welland
was
obliged
year
after
year
to
improvise
an
establishment
partly
made
up
of
discontented
new
york
servants
and
partly
drawn
from
the
local
african
supply
the
doctors
want
my
husband
to
feel
that
he
is
in
his
own
home
otherwise
he
would
be
so
wretched
that
the
climate
would
not
do
him
any
good
she
explained
winter
after
winter
to
the
sympathising
philadelphians
and
baltimoreans
and
welland
beaming
across
a
breakfast
table
miraculously
supplied
with
the
most
varied
delicacies
was
presently
saying
to
archer
you
see
my
dear
fellow
we
camp
we
literally
camp
i
tell
my
wife
and
may
that
i
want
to
teach
them
how
to
rough
it
and
welland
had
been
as
much
surprised
as
their
daughter
by
the
young
man
sudden
arrival
but
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
explain
that
he
had
felt
himself
on
the
verge
of
a
nasty
cold
and
this
seemed
to
welland
an
reason
for
abandoning
any
duty
you
ca
be
too
careful
especially
toward
spring
he
said
heaping
his
plate
with
and
drowning
them
in
golden
syrup
if
i
only
been
as
prudent
at
your
age
may
would
have
been
dancing
at
the
assemblies
now
instead
of
spending
her
winters
in
a
wilderness
with
an
old
invalid
oh
but
i
love
it
here
papa
you
know
i
do
if
only
newland
could
stay
i
should
like
it
a
thousand
times
better
than
new
york
newland
must
stay
till
he
has
quite
thrown
off
his
cold
said
welland
indulgently
and
the
young
man
laughed
and
said
he
supposed
there
was
such
a
thing
as
one
profession
he
managed
however
after
an
exchange
of
telegrams
with
the
firm
to
make
his
cold
last
a
week
and
it
shed
an
ironic
light
on
the
situation
to
know
that
letterblair
indulgence
was
partly
due
to
the
satisfactory
way
in
which
his
brilliant
young
junior
partner
had
settled
the
troublesome
matter
of
the
olenski
divorce
letterblair
had
let
welland
know
that
archer
had
rendered
an
invaluable
service
to
the
whole
family
and
that
old
manson
mingott
had
been
particularly
pleased
and
one
day
when
may
had
gone
for
a
drive
with
her
father
in
the
only
vehicle
the
place
produced
welland
took
occasion
to
touch
on
a
topic
which
she
always
avoided
in
her
presence
i
afraid
ellen
ideas
are
not
at
all
like
ours
she
was
barely
eighteen
when
medora
manson
took
her
back
to
europe
you
remember
the
excitement
when
she
appeared
in
black
at
her
ball
another
of
medora
fads
really
this
time
it
was
almost
prophetic
that
must
have
been
at
least
twelve
years
ago
and
since
then
ellen
has
never
been
to
america
no
wonder
she
is
completely
europeanised
but
european
society
is
not
given
to
divorce
countess
olenska
thought
she
would
be
conforming
to
american
ideas
in
asking
for
her
freedom
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
young
man
had
pronounced
her
name
since
he
had
left
skuytercliff
and
he
felt
the
colour
rise
to
his
cheek
welland
smiled
compassionately
that
is
just
like
the
extraordinary
things
that
foreigners
invent
about
us
they
think
we
dine
at
two
and
countenance
divorce
that
is
why
it
seems
to
me
so
foolish
to
entertain
them
when
they
come
to
new
york
they
accept
our
hospitality
and
then
they
go
home
and
repeat
the
same
stupid
stories
archer
made
no
comment
on
this
and
welland
continued
but
we
do
most
thoroughly
appreciate
your
persuading
ellen
to
give
up
the
idea
her
grandmother
and
her
uncle
lovell
could
do
nothing
with
her
both
of
them
have
written
that
her
changing
her
mind
was
entirely
due
to
your
influence
in
fact
she
said
so
to
her
grandmother
she
has
an
unbounded
admiration
for
you
poor
ellen
she
was
always
a
wayward
child
i
wonder
what
her
fate
will
be
what
we
all
contrived
to
make
it
he
felt
like
answering
if
you
all
of
you
rather
she
should
be
beaufort
mistress
than
some
decent
fellow
wife
you
certainly
gone
the
right
way
about
it
he
wondered
what
welland
would
have
said
if
he
had
uttered
the
words
instead
of
merely
thinking
them
he
could
picture
the
sudden
decomposure
of
her
firm
placid
features
to
which
a
lifelong
mastery
over
trifles
had
given
an
air
of
factitious
authority
traces
still
lingered
on
them
of
a
fresh
beauty
like
her
daughter
and
he
asked
himself
if
may
face
was
doomed
to
thicken
into
the
same
image
of
invincible
innocence
ah
no
he
did
not
want
may
to
have
that
kind
of
innocence
the
innocence
that
seals
the
mind
against
imagination
and
the
heart
against
experience
i
verily
believe
welland
continued
that
if
the
horrible
business
had
come
out
in
the
newspapers
it
would
have
been
my
i
do
know
any
of
the
details
i
only
ask
not
to
as
i
told
poor
ellen
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
me
about
it
having
an
invalid
to
care
for
i
have
to
keep
my
mind
bright
and
happy
but
welland
was
terribly
upset
he
had
a
slight
temperature
every
morning
while
we
were
waiting
to
hear
what
had
been
decided
it
was
the
horror
of
his
girl
learning
that
such
things
were
possible
but
of
course
dear
newland
you
felt
that
too
we
all
knew
that
you
were
thinking
of
may
i
always
thinking
of
may
the
young
man
rejoined
rising
to
cut
short
the
conversation
he
had
meant
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
his
private
talk
with
welland
to
urge
her
to
advance
the
date
of
his
marriage
but
he
could
think
of
no
arguments
that
would
move
her
and
with
a
sense
of
relief
he
saw
welland
and
may
driving
up
to
the
door
his
only
hope
was
to
plead
again
with
may
and
on
the
day
before
his
departure
he
walked
with
her
to
the
ruinous
garden
of
the
spanish
mission
the
background
lent
itself
to
allusions
to
european
scenes
and
may
who
was
looking
her
loveliest
under
a
hat
that
cast
a
shadow
of
mystery
over
her
eyes
kindled
into
eagerness
as
he
spoke
of
granada
and
the
alhambra
we
might
be
seeing
it
all
this
spring
even
the
easter
ceremonies
at
seville
he
urged
exaggerating
his
demands
in
the
hope
of
a
larger
concession
easter
in
seville
and
it
will
be
lent
next
week
she
laughed
why
should
we
be
married
in
lent
he
rejoined
but
she
looked
so
shocked
that
he
saw
his
mistake
of
course
i
did
mean
that
dearest
but
soon
after
easter
so
that
we
could
sail
at
the
end
of
april
i
know
i
could
arrange
it
at
the
office
she
smiled
dreamily
upon
the
possibility
but
he
perceived
that
to
dream
of
it
sufficed
her
it
was
like
hearing
him
read
aloud
out
of
his
poetry
books
the
beautiful
things
that
could
not
possibly
happen
in
real
life
oh
do
go
on
newland
i
do
love
your
descriptions
but
why
should
they
be
only
descriptions
why
should
we
make
them
real
we
shall
dearest
of
course
next
year
her
voice
lingered
over
it
do
you
want
them
to
be
real
sooner
ca
i
persuade
you
to
break
away
now
she
bowed
her
head
vanishing
from
him
under
her
conniving
why
should
we
dream
away
another
year
look
at
me
dear
do
you
understand
how
i
want
you
for
my
wife
for
a
moment
she
remained
motionless
then
she
raised
on
him
eyes
of
such
despairing
dearness
that
he
her
waist
from
his
hold
but
suddenly
her
look
changed
and
deepened
inscrutably
i
not
sure
if
i
do
understand
she
said
is
it
is
it
because
you
not
certain
of
continuing
to
care
for
me
archer
sprang
up
from
his
seat
my
god
perhaps
i
do
know
he
broke
out
angrily
may
welland
rose
also
as
they
faced
each
other
she
seemed
to
grow
in
womanly
stature
and
dignity
both
were
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
dismayed
by
the
unforeseen
trend
of
their
words
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
if
that
is
it
is
there
some
one
else
some
one
else
between
you
and
me
he
echoed
her
words
slowly
as
though
they
were
only
and
he
wanted
time
to
repeat
the
question
to
himself
she
seemed
to
catch
the
uncertainty
of
his
voice
for
she
went
on
in
a
deepening
tone
let
us
talk
frankly
newland
sometimes
i
felt
a
difference
in
you
especially
since
our
engagement
has
been
announced
dear
what
madness
he
recovered
himself
to
exclaim
she
met
his
protest
with
a
faint
smile
if
it
is
it
wo
hurt
us
to
talk
about
it
she
paused
and
added
lifting
her
head
with
one
of
her
noble
movements
or
even
if
it
true
why
should
we
speak
of
it
you
might
so
easily
have
made
a
mistake
he
lowered
his
head
staring
at
the
black
on
the
sunny
path
at
their
feet
mistakes
are
always
easy
to
make
but
if
i
had
made
one
of
the
kind
you
suggest
is
it
likely
that
i
should
be
imploring
you
to
hasten
our
marriage
she
looked
downward
too
disturbing
the
pattern
with
the
point
of
her
sunshade
while
she
struggled
for
expression
yes
she
said
at
length
you
might
want
once
for
all
to
settle
the
question
one
way
her
quiet
lucidity
startled
him
but
did
not
mislead
him
into
thinking
her
insensible
under
her
he
saw
the
pallor
of
her
profile
and
a
slight
tremor
of
the
nostril
above
her
resolutely
steadied
lips
well
he
questioned
sitting
down
on
the
bench
and
looking
up
at
her
with
a
frown
that
he
tried
to
make
playful
she
dropped
back
into
her
seat
and
went
on
you
must
think
that
a
girl
knows
as
little
as
her
parents
imagine
one
hears
and
one
notices
one
has
one
feelings
and
ideas
and
of
course
long
before
you
told
me
that
you
cared
for
me
i
known
that
there
was
some
one
else
you
were
interested
in
every
one
was
talking
about
it
two
years
ago
at
newport
and
once
i
saw
you
sitting
together
on
the
verandah
at
a
dance
and
when
she
came
back
into
the
house
her
face
was
sad
and
i
felt
sorry
for
her
i
remembered
it
afterward
when
we
were
engaged
her
voice
had
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
and
she
sat
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
about
the
handle
of
her
sunshade
the
young
man
laid
his
upon
them
with
a
gentle
pressure
his
heart
dilated
with
an
inexpressible
relief
my
dear
child
was
that
it
if
you
only
knew
the
truth
she
raised
her
head
quickly
then
there
is
a
truth
i
do
know
he
kept
his
hand
over
hers
i
meant
the
truth
about
the
old
story
you
speak
of
but
that
what
i
want
to
know
newland
what
i
ought
to
know
i
could
have
my
happiness
made
out
of
a
wrong
an
unfairness
to
somebody
else
and
i
want
to
believe
that
it
would
be
the
same
with
you
what
sort
of
a
life
could
we
build
on
such
foundations
her
face
had
taken
on
a
look
of
such
tragic
courage
that
he
felt
like
bowing
himself
down
at
her
feet
i
wanted
to
say
this
for
a
long
time
she
went
on
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
when
two
people
really
love
each
other
i
understand
that
there
may
be
situations
which
make
it
right
that
they
should
should
go
against
public
opinion
and
if
you
feel
yourself
in
any
way
pledged
pledged
to
the
person
spoken
of
and
if
there
is
any
way
any
way
in
which
you
can
fulfill
your
pledge
even
by
her
getting
a
divorce
newland
do
give
her
up
because
of
me
his
surprise
at
discovering
that
her
fears
had
fastened
upon
an
episode
so
remote
and
so
completely
of
the
past
as
his
with
thorley
rushworth
gave
way
to
wonder
at
the
generosity
of
her
view
there
was
something
superhuman
in
an
attitude
so
recklessly
unorthodox
and
if
other
problems
had
not
pressed
on
him
he
would
have
been
lost
in
wonder
at
the
prodigy
of
the
wellands
daughter
urging
him
to
marry
his
former
mistress
but
he
was
still
dizzy
with
the
glimpse
of
the
precipice
they
had
skirted
and
full
of
a
new
awe
at
the
mystery
of
for
a
moment
he
could
not
speak
then
he
said
there
is
no
pledge
no
obligation
whatever
of
the
kind
you
think
such
cases
always
present
themselves
quite
as
simply
as
but
that
no
matter
i
love
your
generosity
because
i
feel
as
you
do
about
those
things
i
feel
that
each
case
must
be
judged
individually
on
its
own
merits
irrespective
of
stupid
conventionalities
i
mean
each
woman
right
to
her
liberty
he
pulled
himself
up
startled
by
the
turn
his
thoughts
had
taken
and
went
on
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
since
you
understand
so
many
things
dearest
ca
you
go
a
little
farther
and
understand
the
uselessness
of
our
submitting
to
another
form
of
the
same
foolish
conventionalities
if
there
no
one
and
nothing
between
us
is
that
an
argument
for
marrying
quickly
rather
than
for
more
delay
she
flushed
with
joy
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
as
he
bent
to
it
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
happy
tears
but
in
another
moment
she
seemed
to
have
descended
from
her
womanly
eminence
to
helpless
and
timorous
girlhood
and
he
understood
that
her
courage
and
initiative
were
all
for
others
and
that
she
had
none
for
herself
it
was
evident
that
the
effort
of
speaking
had
been
much
greater
than
her
studied
composure
betrayed
and
that
at
his
first
word
of
reassurance
she
had
dropped
back
into
the
usual
as
a
child
takes
refuge
in
its
mother
arms
archer
had
no
heart
to
go
on
pleading
with
her
he
was
too
much
disappointed
at
the
vanishing
of
the
new
being
who
had
cast
that
one
deep
look
at
him
from
her
transparent
eyes
may
seemed
to
be
aware
of
his
disappointment
but
without
knowing
how
to
alleviate
it
and
they
stood
up
and
walked
silently
home
xvii
your
cousin
the
countess
called
on
mother
while
you
were
away
janey
archer
announced
to
her
brother
on
the
evening
of
his
return
the
young
man
who
was
dining
alone
with
his
mother
and
sister
glanced
up
in
surprise
and
saw
archer
gaze
demurely
bent
on
her
plate
archer
did
not
regard
her
seclusion
from
the
world
as
a
reason
for
being
forgotten
by
it
and
newland
guessed
that
she
was
slightly
annoyed
that
he
should
be
surprised
by
madame
olenska
visit
she
had
on
a
black
velvet
polonaise
with
jet
buttons
and
a
tiny
green
monkey
muff
i
never
saw
her
so
stylishly
dressed
janey
continued
she
came
alone
early
on
sunday
afternoon
luckily
the
fire
was
lit
in
the
she
had
one
of
those
new
she
said
she
wanted
to
know
us
because
you
been
so
good
to
her
newland
laughed
madame
olenska
always
takes
that
tone
about
her
friends
she
very
happy
at
being
among
her
own
people
again
yes
so
she
told
us
said
archer
i
must
say
she
seems
thankful
to
be
here
i
hope
you
liked
her
mother
archer
drew
her
lips
together
she
certainly
lays
herself
out
to
please
even
when
she
is
calling
on
an
old
lady
mother
does
think
her
simple
janey
interjected
her
eyes
screwed
upon
her
brother
face
it
just
my
feeling
dear
may
is
my
ideal
said
archer
ah
said
her
son
they
not
alike
archer
had
left
augustine
charged
with
many
messages
for
old
mingott
and
a
day
or
two
after
his
return
to
town
he
called
on
her
the
old
lady
received
him
with
unusual
warmth
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
persuading
the
countess
olenska
to
give
up
the
idea
of
a
divorce
and
when
he
told
her
that
he
had
deserted
the
office
without
leave
and
rushed
down
to
augustine
simply
because
he
wanted
to
see
may
she
gave
an
adipose
chuckle
and
patted
his
knee
with
her
hand
ah
ah
so
you
kicked
over
the
traces
did
you
and
i
suppose
augusta
and
welland
pulled
long
faces
and
behaved
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
but
little
may
she
knew
better
i
be
bound
i
hoped
she
did
but
after
all
she
would
agree
to
what
i
gone
down
to
ask
for
would
she
indeed
and
what
was
that
i
wanted
to
get
her
to
promise
that
we
should
be
married
in
april
what
the
use
of
our
wasting
another
year
manson
mingott
screwed
up
her
little
mouth
into
a
grimace
of
mimic
prudery
and
twinkled
at
him
through
malicious
lids
mamma
i
suppose
the
usual
story
ah
these
mingotts
all
alike
born
in
a
rut
and
you
ca
root
out
of
it
when
i
built
this
house
have
thought
i
was
moving
to
california
nobody
ever
had
built
above
fortieth
street
no
says
i
nor
above
the
battery
either
before
christopher
columbus
discovered
america
no
no
not
one
of
them
wants
to
be
different
they
as
scared
of
it
as
the
ah
my
dear
archer
i
thank
my
stars
i
nothing
but
a
vulgar
spicer
but
there
not
one
of
my
own
children
that
takes
after
me
but
my
little
ellen
she
broke
off
still
twinkling
at
him
and
asked
with
the
casual
irrelevance
of
old
age
now
why
in
the
world
did
you
marry
my
little
ellen
archer
laughed
for
one
thing
she
was
there
to
be
married
no
to
be
sure
more
the
pity
and
now
it
too
late
her
life
is
finished
she
spoke
with
the
complacency
of
the
aged
throwing
earth
into
the
grave
of
young
hopes
the
young
man
heart
grew
chill
and
he
said
hurriedly
ca
i
persuade
you
to
use
your
influence
with
the
wellands
mingott
i
was
made
for
long
engagements
old
catherine
beamed
on
him
approvingly
no
i
can
see
that
got
a
quick
eye
when
you
were
a
little
boy
i
no
doubt
you
liked
to
be
helped
first
she
threw
back
her
head
with
a
laugh
that
made
her
chins
ripple
like
little
waves
ah
here
my
ellen
now
she
exclaimed
as
the
portieres
parted
behind
her
madame
olenska
came
forward
with
a
smile
her
face
looked
vivid
and
happy
and
she
held
out
her
hand
gaily
to
archer
while
she
stooped
to
her
grandmother
kiss
i
was
just
saying
to
him
my
dear
why
did
you
marry
my
little
ellen
madame
olenska
looked
at
archer
still
smiling
and
what
did
he
answer
oh
my
darling
i
leave
you
to
find
that
out
he
been
down
to
florida
to
see
his
sweetheart
yes
i
know
she
still
looked
at
him
i
went
to
see
your
mother
to
ask
where
you
gone
i
sent
a
note
that
you
never
answered
and
i
was
afraid
you
were
he
muttered
something
about
leaving
unexpectedly
in
a
great
hurry
and
having
intended
to
write
to
her
from
augustine
and
of
course
once
you
were
there
you
never
thought
of
me
again
she
continued
to
beam
on
him
with
a
gaiety
that
might
have
been
a
studied
assumption
of
indifference
if
she
still
needs
me
she
determined
not
to
let
me
see
it
he
thought
stung
by
her
manner
he
wanted
to
thank
her
for
having
been
to
see
his
mother
but
under
the
ancestress
malicious
eye
he
felt
himself
and
constrained
look
at
him
in
such
hot
haste
to
get
married
that
he
took
french
leave
and
rushed
down
to
implore
the
silly
girl
on
his
knees
something
like
a
lover
that
the
way
handsome
bob
spicer
carried
off
my
poor
mother
and
then
got
tired
of
her
before
i
was
weaned
though
they
only
had
to
wait
eight
months
for
me
but
there
you
not
a
spicer
young
man
luckily
for
you
and
for
may
it
only
my
poor
ellen
that
has
kept
any
of
their
wicked
blood
the
rest
of
them
are
all
model
mingotts
cried
the
old
lady
scornfully
archer
was
aware
that
madame
olenska
who
had
seated
herself
at
her
grandmother
side
was
still
thoughtfully
scrutinising
him
the
gaiety
had
faded
from
her
eyes
and
she
said
with
great
gentleness
surely
granny
we
can
persuade
them
between
us
to
do
as
he
wishes
archer
rose
to
go
and
as
his
hand
met
madame
olenska
he
felt
that
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
make
some
allusion
to
her
unanswered
letter
when
can
i
see
you
he
asked
as
she
walked
with
him
to
the
door
of
the
room
whenever
you
like
but
it
must
be
soon
if
you
want
to
see
the
little
house
again
i
am
moving
next
week
a
pang
shot
through
him
at
the
memory
of
his
lamplit
hours
in
the
few
as
they
had
been
they
were
thick
with
memories
tomorrow
evening
she
nodded
tomorrow
yes
but
early
i
going
out
the
next
day
was
a
sunday
and
if
she
were
going
out
on
a
sunday
evening
it
could
of
course
be
only
to
lemuel
struthers
he
felt
a
slight
movement
of
annoyance
not
so
much
at
her
going
there
for
he
rather
liked
her
going
where
she
pleased
in
spite
of
the
van
der
luydens
but
because
it
was
the
kind
of
house
at
which
she
was
sure
to
meet
beaufort
where
she
must
have
known
beforehand
that
she
would
meet
him
and
where
she
was
probably
going
for
that
purpose
very
well
tomorrow
evening
he
repeated
inwardly
resolved
that
he
would
not
go
early
and
that
by
reaching
her
door
late
he
would
either
prevent
her
from
going
to
struthers
or
else
arrive
after
she
had
started
which
all
things
considered
would
no
doubt
be
the
simplest
solution
it
was
only
eight
after
all
when
he
rang
the
bell
under
the
wisteria
not
as
late
as
he
had
intended
by
half
an
hour
but
a
singular
restlessness
had
driven
him
to
her
door
he
reflected
however
that
struthers
sunday
evenings
were
not
like
a
ball
and
that
her
guests
as
if
to
minimise
their
delinquency
usually
went
early
the
one
thing
he
had
not
counted
on
in
entering
madame
olenska
hall
was
to
find
hats
and
overcoats
there
why
had
she
bidden
him
to
come
early
if
she
was
having
people
to
dine
on
a
closer
inspection
of
the
garments
besides
which
nastasia
was
laying
his
own
his
resentment
gave
way
to
curiosity
the
overcoats
were
in
fact
the
very
strangest
he
had
ever
seen
under
a
polite
roof
and
it
took
but
a
glance
to
assure
himself
that
neither
of
them
belonged
to
julius
beaufort
one
was
a
shaggy
yellow
ulster
of
cut
the
other
a
very
old
and
rusty
cloak
with
a
cape
something
like
what
the
french
called
a
macfarlane
this
garment
which
appeared
to
be
made
for
a
person
of
prodigious
size
had
evidently
seen
long
and
hard
wear
and
its
folds
gave
out
a
moist
sawdusty
smell
suggestive
of
prolonged
sessions
against
walls
on
it
lay
a
ragged
grey
scarf
and
an
odd
felt
hat
of
semiclerical
shape
archer
raised
his
eyebrows
enquiringly
at
nastasia
who
raised
hers
in
return
with
a
fatalistic
gia
as
she
threw
open
the
door
the
young
man
saw
at
once
that
his
hostess
was
not
in
the
room
then
with
surprise
he
discovered
another
lady
standing
by
the
fire
this
lady
who
was
long
lean
and
loosely
put
together
was
clad
in
raiment
intricately
looped
and
fringed
with
plaids
and
stripes
and
bands
of
plain
colour
disposed
in
a
design
to
which
the
clue
seemed
missing
her
hair
which
had
tried
to
turn
white
and
only
succeeded
in
fading
was
surmounted
by
a
spanish
comb
and
black
lace
scarf
and
silk
mittens
visibly
darned
covered
her
rheumatic
hands
beside
her
in
a
cloud
of
stood
the
owners
of
the
two
overcoats
both
in
morning
clothes
that
they
had
evidently
not
taken
off
since
morning
in
one
of
the
two
archer
to
his
surprise
recognised
ned
winsett
the
other
and
older
who
was
unknown
to
him
and
whose
gigantic
frame
declared
him
to
be
the
wearer
of
the
macfarlane
had
a
feebly
leonine
head
with
crumpled
grey
hair
and
moved
his
arms
with
large
pawing
gestures
as
though
he
were
distributing
lay
blessings
to
a
kneeling
multitude
these
three
persons
stood
together
on
the
their
eyes
fixed
on
an
extraordinarily
large
bouquet
of
crimson
roses
with
a
knot
of
purple
pansies
at
their
base
that
lay
on
the
sofa
where
madame
olenska
usually
sat
what
they
must
have
cost
at
this
season
though
of
course
it
the
sentiment
one
cares
about
the
lady
was
saying
in
a
sighing
staccato
as
archer
came
in
the
three
turned
with
surprise
at
his
appearance
and
the
lady
advancing
held
out
her
hand
dear
archer
almost
my
cousin
newland
she
said
i
am
the
marchioness
manson
archer
bowed
and
she
continued
my
ellen
has
taken
me
in
for
a
few
days
i
came
from
cuba
where
i
have
been
spending
the
winter
with
spanish
friends
such
delightful
distinguished
people
the
highest
nobility
of
old
castile
how
i
wish
you
could
know
them
but
i
was
called
away
by
our
dear
great
friend
here
dr
carver
you
do
know
agathon
carver
founder
of
the
valley
of
love
community
dr
carver
inclined
his
leonine
head
and
the
marchioness
continued
ah
new
york
new
york
how
little
the
life
of
the
spirit
has
reached
it
but
i
see
you
do
know
mr
winsett
oh
yes
i
reached
him
some
time
ago
but
not
by
that
route
winsett
said
with
his
dry
smile
the
marchioness
shook
her
head
reprovingly
how
do
you
know
winsett
the
spirit
bloweth
where
it
listeth
list
oh
list
interjected
dr
carver
in
a
stentorian
murmur
but
do
sit
down
archer
we
four
have
been
having
a
delightful
little
dinner
together
and
my
child
has
gone
up
to
dress
she
expects
you
she
will
be
down
in
a
moment
we
were
just
admiring
these
marvellous
flowers
which
will
surprise
her
when
she
reappears
winsett
remained
on
his
feet
i
afraid
i
must
be
off
please
tell
madame
olenska
that
we
shall
all
feel
lost
when
she
abandons
our
street
this
house
has
been
an
oasis
ah
but
she
wo
abandon
you
poetry
and
art
are
the
breath
of
life
to
her
it
is
poetry
you
write
mr
winsett
well
no
but
i
sometimes
read
it
said
winsett
including
the
group
in
a
general
nod
and
slipping
out
of
the
room
a
caustic
spirit
un
peu
sauvage
but
so
witty
dr
carver
you
do
think
him
witty
i
never
think
of
wit
said
dr
carver
severely
ah
ah
you
never
think
of
wit
how
merciless
he
is
to
us
weak
mortals
archer
but
he
lives
only
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
and
tonight
he
is
mentally
preparing
the
lecture
he
is
to
deliver
presently
at
blenker
dr
carver
would
there
be
time
before
you
start
for
the
blenkers
to
explain
to
archer
your
illuminating
discovery
of
the
direct
contact
but
no
i
see
it
is
nearly
nine
and
we
have
no
right
to
detain
you
while
so
many
are
waiting
for
your
message
dr
carver
looked
slightly
disappointed
at
this
conclusion
but
having
compared
his
ponderous
gold
with
madame
olenska
little
he
reluctantly
gathered
up
his
mighty
limbs
for
departure
i
shall
see
you
later
dear
friend
he
suggested
to
the
marchioness
who
replied
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
ellen
carriage
comes
i
will
join
you
i
do
hope
the
lecture
wo
have
begun
dr
carver
looked
thoughtfully
at
archer
perhaps
if
this
young
gentleman
is
interested
in
my
experiences
blenker
might
allow
you
to
bring
him
with
you
oh
dear
friend
if
it
were
possible
i
am
sure
she
would
be
too
happy
but
i
fear
my
ellen
counts
on
archer
herself
that
said
dr
carver
is
unfortunate
but
here
is
my
card
he
handed
it
to
archer
who
read
on
it
in
gothic
characters
agathon
carver
the
valley
of
love
kittasquattamy
y
dr
carver
bowed
himself
out
and
manson
with
a
sigh
that
might
have
been
either
of
regret
or
relief
again
waved
archer
to
a
seat
ellen
will
be
down
in
a
moment
and
before
she
comes
i
am
so
glad
of
this
quiet
moment
with
you
archer
murmured
his
pleasure
at
their
meeting
and
the
marchioness
continued
in
her
low
sighing
accents
i
know
everything
dear
archer
my
child
has
told
me
all
you
have
done
for
her
your
wise
advice
your
courageous
firmness
thank
heaven
it
was
not
too
late
the
young
man
listened
with
considerable
embarrassment
was
there
any
one
he
wondered
to
whom
madame
olenska
had
not
proclaimed
his
intervention
in
her
private
affairs
madame
olenska
exaggerates
i
simply
gave
her
a
legal
opinion
as
she
asked
me
to
ah
but
in
doing
it
in
doing
it
you
were
the
unconscious
instrument
of
of
what
word
have
we
moderns
for
providence
mr
archer
cried
the
lady
tilting
her
head
on
one
side
and
drooping
her
lids
mysteriously
little
did
you
know
that
at
that
very
moment
i
was
being
appealed
to
being
approached
in
fact
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
though
fearful
of
being
overheard
and
then
drawing
her
chair
nearer
and
raising
a
tiny
ivory
fan
to
her
lips
breathed
behind
it
by
the
count
himself
my
poor
mad
foolish
olenski
who
asks
only
to
take
her
back
on
her
own
terms
good
god
archer
exclaimed
springing
up
you
are
horrified
yes
of
course
i
understand
i
do
defend
poor
stanislas
though
he
has
always
called
me
his
best
friend
he
does
not
defend
himself
he
casts
himself
at
her
feet
in
my
person
she
tapped
her
emaciated
bosom
i
have
his
letter
here
a
letter
has
madame
olenska
seen
it
archer
stammered
his
brain
whirling
with
the
shock
of
the
announcement
the
marchioness
manson
shook
her
head
softly
time
time
i
must
have
time
i
know
my
ellen
haughty
intractable
shall
i
say
just
a
shade
unforgiving
but
good
heavens
to
forgive
is
one
thing
to
go
back
into
that
hell
ah
yes
the
marchioness
acquiesced
so
she
describes
it
my
sensitive
child
but
on
the
material
side
archer
if
one
may
stoop
to
consider
such
things
do
you
know
what
she
is
giving
up
those
roses
there
on
the
sofa
acres
like
them
under
glass
and
in
the
open
in
his
matchless
terraced
gardens
at
nice
jewels
historic
pearls
the
sobieski
emeralds
sables
but
she
cares
nothing
for
all
these
art
and
beauty
those
she
does
care
for
she
lives
for
as
i
always
have
and
those
also
surrounded
her
pictures
priceless
furniture
music
brilliant
conversation
ah
that
my
dear
young
man
if
you
excuse
me
is
what
you
no
conception
of
here
and
she
had
it
all
and
the
homage
of
the
greatest
she
tells
me
she
is
not
thought
handsome
in
new
york
good
heavens
her
portrait
has
been
painted
nine
times
the
greatest
artists
in
europe
have
begged
for
the
privilege
are
these
things
nothing
and
the
remorse
of
an
adoring
husband
as
the
marchioness
manson
rose
to
her
climax
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
ecstatic
retrospection
which
would
have
moved
mirth
had
he
not
been
numb
with
amazement
he
would
have
laughed
if
any
one
had
foretold
to
him
that
his
first
sight
of
poor
medora
manson
would
have
been
in
the
guise
of
a
messenger
of
satan
but
he
was
in
no
mood
for
laughing
now
and
she
seemed
to
him
to
come
straight
out
of
the
hell
from
which
ellen
olenska
had
just
escaped
she
knows
nothing
yet
of
all
this
he
asked
abruptly
manson
laid
a
purple
finger
on
her
lips
nothing
directly
but
does
she
suspect
who
can
tell
the
truth
is
archer
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
you
from
the
moment
i
heard
of
the
firm
stand
you
had
taken
and
of
your
influence
over
her
i
hoped
it
might
be
possible
to
count
on
your
support
to
convince
you
that
she
ought
to
go
back
i
would
rather
see
her
dead
cried
the
young
man
violently
ah
the
marchioness
murmured
without
visible
resentment
for
a
while
she
sat
in
her
opening
and
shutting
the
absurd
ivory
fan
between
her
mittened
fingers
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
and
listened
here
she
comes
she
said
in
a
rapid
whisper
and
then
pointing
to
the
bouquet
on
the
sofa
am
i
to
understand
that
you
prefer
that
archer
after
all
marriage
is
marriage
and
my
niece
is
still
a
wife
xviii
what
are
you
two
plotting
together
aunt
medora
madame
olenska
cried
as
she
came
into
the
room
she
was
dressed
as
if
for
a
ball
everything
about
her
shimmered
and
glimmered
softly
as
if
her
dress
had
been
woven
out
of
and
she
carried
her
head
high
like
a
pretty
woman
challenging
a
roomful
of
rivals
we
were
saying
my
dear
that
here
was
something
beautiful
to
surprise
you
with
manson
rejoined
rising
to
her
feet
and
pointing
archly
to
the
flowers
madame
olenska
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
bouquet
her
colour
did
not
change
but
a
sort
of
white
radiance
of
anger
ran
over
her
like
summer
lightning
ah
she
exclaimed
in
a
shrill
voice
that
the
young
man
had
never
heard
who
is
ridiculous
enough
to
send
me
a
bouquet
why
a
bouquet
and
why
tonight
of
all
nights
i
am
not
going
to
a
ball
i
am
not
a
girl
engaged
to
be
married
but
some
people
are
always
ridiculous
she
turned
back
to
the
door
opened
it
and
called
out
nastasia
the
ubiquitous
handmaiden
promptly
appeared
and
archer
heard
madame
olenska
say
in
an
italian
that
she
seemed
to
pronounce
with
intentional
deliberateness
in
order
that
he
might
follow
it
here
throw
this
into
the
dustbin
and
then
as
nastasia
stared
protestingly
but
no
it
not
the
fault
of
the
poor
flowers
tell
the
boy
to
carry
them
to
the
house
three
doors
away
the
house
of
winsett
the
dark
gentleman
who
dined
here
his
wife
is
ill
they
may
give
her
pleasure
the
boy
is
out
you
say
then
my
dear
one
run
yourself
here
put
my
cloak
over
you
and
fly
i
want
the
thing
out
of
the
house
immediately
and
as
you
live
do
say
they
come
from
me
she
flung
her
velvet
opera
cloak
over
the
maid
shoulders
and
turned
back
into
the
shutting
the
door
sharply
her
bosom
was
rising
high
under
its
lace
and
for
a
moment
archer
thought
she
was
about
to
cry
but
she
burst
into
a
laugh
instead
and
looking
from
the
marchioness
to
archer
asked
abruptly
and
you
two
have
you
made
friends
it
for
archer
to
say
darling
he
has
waited
patiently
while
you
were
dressing
yes
i
gave
you
time
enough
my
hair
would
go
madame
olenska
said
raising
her
hand
to
the
curls
of
her
chignon
but
that
reminds
me
i
see
dr
carver
is
gone
and
you
be
late
at
the
blenkers
archer
will
you
put
my
aunt
in
the
carriage
she
followed
the
marchioness
into
the
hall
saw
her
fitted
into
a
miscellaneous
heap
of
overshoes
shawls
and
tippets
and
called
from
the
doorstep
mind
the
carriage
is
to
be
back
for
me
at
ten
then
she
returned
to
the
where
archer
on
it
found
her
standing
by
the
mantelpiece
examining
herself
in
the
mirror
it
was
not
usual
in
new
york
society
for
a
lady
to
address
her
as
my
dear
one
and
send
her
out
on
an
errand
wrapped
in
her
own
and
archer
through
all
his
deeper
feelings
tasted
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
being
in
a
world
where
action
followed
on
emotion
with
such
olympian
speed
madame
olenska
did
not
move
when
he
came
up
behind
her
and
for
a
second
their
eyes
met
in
the
mirror
then
she
turned
threw
herself
into
her
and
sighed
out
there
time
for
a
cigarette
he
handed
her
the
box
and
lit
a
spill
for
her
and
as
the
flame
flashed
up
into
her
face
she
glanced
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
and
said
what
do
you
think
of
me
in
a
temper
archer
paused
a
moment
then
he
answered
with
sudden
resolution
it
makes
me
understand
what
your
aunt
has
been
saying
about
you
i
knew
she
been
talking
about
me
well
she
said
you
were
used
to
all
kinds
of
things
splendours
and
amusements
and
excitements
that
we
could
never
hope
to
give
you
here
madame
olenska
smiled
faintly
into
the
circle
of
smoke
about
her
lips
medora
is
incorrigibly
romantic
it
has
made
up
to
her
for
so
many
things
archer
hesitated
again
and
again
took
his
risk
is
your
romanticism
always
consistent
with
accuracy
you
mean
does
she
speak
the
truth
her
niece
considered
well
i
tell
you
in
almost
everything
she
says
there
something
true
and
something
untrue
but
why
do
you
ask
what
has
she
been
telling
you
he
looked
away
into
the
fire
and
then
back
at
her
shining
presence
his
heart
tightened
with
the
thought
that
this
was
their
last
evening
by
that
fireside
and
that
in
a
moment
the
carriage
would
come
to
carry
her
away
she
says
she
pretends
that
count
olenski
has
asked
her
to
persuade
you
to
go
back
to
him
madame
olenska
made
no
answer
she
sat
motionless
holding
her
cigarette
in
her
hand
the
expression
of
her
face
had
not
changed
and
archer
remembered
that
he
had
before
noticed
her
apparent
incapacity
for
surprise
you
knew
then
he
broke
out
she
was
silent
for
so
long
that
the
ash
dropped
from
her
cigarette
she
brushed
it
to
the
floor
she
has
hinted
about
a
letter
poor
darling
medora
hints
is
it
at
your
husband
request
that
she
has
arrived
here
suddenly
madame
olenska
seemed
to
consider
this
question
also
there
again
one
ca
tell
she
told
me
she
had
had
a
summons
whatever
that
is
from
dr
carver
i
afraid
she
going
to
marry
dr
carver
poor
medora
there
always
some
one
she
wants
to
marry
but
perhaps
the
people
in
cuba
just
got
tired
of
her
i
think
she
was
with
them
as
a
sort
of
paid
companion
really
i
do
know
why
she
came
but
you
do
believe
she
has
a
letter
from
your
husband
again
madame
olenska
brooded
silently
then
she
said
after
all
it
was
to
be
expected
the
young
man
rose
and
went
to
lean
against
the
fireplace
a
sudden
restlessness
possessed
him
and
he
was
by
the
sense
that
their
minutes
were
numbered
and
that
at
any
moment
he
might
hear
the
wheels
of
the
returning
carriage
you
know
that
your
aunt
believes
you
will
go
back
madame
olenska
raised
her
head
quickly
a
deep
blush
rose
to
her
face
and
spread
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
she
blushed
seldom
and
painfully
as
if
it
hurt
her
like
a
burn
many
cruel
things
have
been
believed
of
me
she
said
oh
ellen
forgive
me
i
a
fool
and
a
brute
she
smiled
a
little
you
are
horribly
nervous
you
have
your
own
troubles
i
know
you
think
the
wellands
are
unreasonable
about
your
marriage
and
of
course
i
agree
with
you
in
europe
people
understand
our
long
american
engagements
i
suppose
they
are
not
as
calm
as
we
are
she
pronounced
the
we
with
a
faint
emphasis
that
gave
it
an
ironic
sound
archer
felt
the
irony
but
did
not
dare
to
take
it
up
after
all
she
had
perhaps
purposely
deflected
the
conversation
from
her
own
affairs
and
after
the
pain
his
last
words
had
evidently
caused
her
he
felt
that
all
he
could
do
was
to
follow
her
lead
but
the
sense
of
the
waning
hour
made
him
desperate
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
a
barrier
of
words
should
drop
between
them
again
yes
he
said
abruptly
i
went
south
to
ask
may
to
marry
me
after
easter
there
no
reason
why
we
should
be
married
then
and
may
adores
you
and
yet
you
could
convince
her
i
thought
her
too
intelligent
to
be
the
slave
of
such
absurd
superstitions
she
is
too
intelligent
she
not
their
slave
madame
olenska
looked
at
him
well
then
i
do
understand
archer
reddened
and
hurried
on
with
a
rush
we
had
a
frank
talk
almost
the
first
she
thinks
my
impatience
a
bad
sign
merciful
heavens
a
bad
sign
she
thinks
it
means
that
i
ca
trust
myself
to
go
on
caring
for
her
she
thinks
in
short
i
want
to
marry
her
at
once
to
get
away
from
some
one
that
i
care
for
more
madame
olenska
examined
this
curiously
but
if
she
thinks
that
why
is
she
in
a
hurry
too
because
she
not
like
that
she
so
much
nobler
she
insists
all
the
more
on
the
long
engagement
to
give
me
time
time
to
give
her
up
for
the
other
woman
if
i
want
to
madame
olenska
leaned
toward
the
fire
and
gazed
into
it
with
fixed
eyes
down
the
quiet
street
archer
heard
the
approaching
trot
of
her
horses
that
is
noble
she
said
with
a
slight
break
in
her
voice
yes
but
it
ridiculous
ridiculous
because
you
do
care
for
any
one
else
because
i
do
mean
to
marry
any
one
else
ah
there
was
another
long
interval
at
length
she
looked
up
at
him
and
asked
this
other
woman
does
she
love
you
oh
there
no
other
woman
i
mean
the
person
that
may
was
thinking
of
is
was
never
then
why
after
all
are
you
in
such
haste
there
your
carriage
said
archer
she
and
looked
about
her
with
absent
eyes
her
fan
and
gloves
lay
on
the
sofa
beside
her
and
she
picked
them
up
mechanically
yes
i
suppose
i
must
be
going
you
going
to
mrs
struthers
yes
she
smiled
and
added
i
must
go
where
i
am
invited
or
i
should
be
too
lonely
why
not
come
with
me
archer
felt
that
at
any
cost
he
must
keep
her
beside
him
must
make
her
give
him
the
rest
of
her
evening
ignoring
her
question
he
continued
to
lean
against
the
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hand
in
which
she
held
her
gloves
and
fan
as
if
watching
to
see
if
he
had
the
power
to
make
her
drop
them
may
guessed
the
truth
he
said
there
is
another
woman
but
not
the
one
she
thinks
ellen
olenska
made
no
answer
and
did
not
move
after
a
moment
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
softly
unclasped
it
so
that
the
gloves
and
fan
fell
on
the
sofa
between
them
she
started
up
and
freeing
herself
from
him
moved
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
ah
do
make
love
to
me
too
many
people
have
done
that
she
said
frowning
archer
changing
colour
stood
up
also
it
was
the
bitterest
rebuke
she
could
have
given
him
i
have
never
made
love
to
you
he
said
and
i
never
shall
but
you
are
the
woman
i
would
have
married
if
it
had
been
possible
for
either
of
us
possible
for
either
of
us
she
looked
at
him
with
unfeigned
astonishment
and
you
say
that
when
it
you
who
made
it
impossible
he
stared
at
her
groping
in
a
blackness
through
which
a
single
arrow
of
light
tore
its
blinding
way
i
made
it
impossible
you
you
you
she
cried
her
lip
trembling
like
a
child
on
the
verge
of
tears
is
it
you
who
made
me
give
up
divorcing
give
it
up
because
you
showed
me
how
selfish
and
wicked
it
was
how
one
must
sacrifice
one
self
to
preserve
the
dignity
of
marriage
and
to
spare
one
family
the
publicity
the
scandal
and
because
my
family
was
going
to
be
your
family
for
may
sake
and
for
yours
i
did
what
you
told
me
what
you
proved
to
me
that
i
ought
to
do
ah
she
broke
out
with
a
sudden
laugh
i
made
no
secret
of
having
done
it
for
you
she
sank
down
on
the
sofa
again
crouching
among
the
festive
ripples
of
her
dress
like
a
stricken
masquerader
and
the
young
man
stood
by
the
fireplace
and
continued
to
gaze
at
her
without
moving
good
god
he
groaned
when
i
thought
you
thought
ah
do
ask
me
what
i
thought
still
looking
at
her
he
saw
the
same
burning
flush
creep
up
her
neck
to
her
face
she
sat
upright
facing
him
with
a
rigid
dignity
i
do
ask
you
well
then
there
were
things
in
that
letter
you
asked
me
to
read
my
husband
letter
yes
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
that
letter
absolutely
nothing
all
i
feared
was
to
bring
notoriety
scandal
on
the
family
on
you
and
may
good
god
he
groaned
again
bowing
his
face
in
his
hands
the
silence
that
followed
lay
on
them
with
the
weight
of
things
final
and
irrevocable
it
seemed
to
archer
to
be
crushing
him
down
like
his
own
in
all
the
wide
future
he
saw
nothing
that
would
ever
lift
that
load
from
his
heart
he
did
not
move
from
his
place
or
raise
his
head
from
his
hands
his
hidden
eyeballs
went
on
staring
into
utter
darkness
at
least
i
loved
you
he
brought
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
from
the
where
he
supposed
that
she
still
crouched
he
heard
a
faint
stifled
crying
like
a
child
he
started
up
and
came
to
her
side
ellen
what
madness
why
are
you
crying
nothing
done
that
be
undone
i
still
free
and
you
going
to
be
he
had
her
in
his
arms
her
face
like
a
wet
flower
at
his
lips
and
all
their
vain
terrors
shrivelling
up
like
ghosts
at
sunrise
the
one
thing
that
astonished
him
now
was
that
he
should
have
stood
for
five
minutes
arguing
with
her
across
the
width
of
the
room
when
just
touching
her
made
everything
so
simple
she
gave
him
back
all
his
kiss
but
after
a
moment
he
felt
her
stiffening
in
his
arms
and
she
put
him
aside
and
stood
up
ah
my
poor
newland
i
suppose
this
had
to
be
but
it
does
in
the
least
alter
things
she
said
looking
down
at
him
in
her
turn
from
the
hearth
it
alters
the
whole
of
life
for
me
no
no
it
must
it
ca
you
engaged
to
may
welland
and
married
he
stood
up
too
flushed
and
resolute
nonsense
it
too
late
for
that
sort
of
thing
we
no
right
to
lie
to
other
people
or
to
ourselves
we
wo
talk
of
your
marriage
but
do
you
see
me
marrying
may
after
this
she
stood
silent
resting
her
thin
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
her
profile
reflected
in
the
glass
behind
her
one
of
the
locks
of
her
chignon
had
become
loosened
and
hung
on
her
neck
she
looked
haggard
and
almost
old
i
do
see
you
she
said
at
length
putting
that
question
to
may
do
you
he
gave
a
reckless
shrug
it
too
late
to
do
anything
else
you
say
that
because
it
the
easiest
thing
to
say
at
this
moment
not
because
it
true
in
reality
it
too
late
to
do
anything
but
what
we
both
decided
on
ah
i
do
understand
you
she
forced
a
pitiful
smile
that
pinched
her
face
instead
of
smoothing
it
you
do
understand
because
you
have
yet
guessed
how
changed
things
for
me
oh
from
the
first
long
before
i
knew
all
done
all
i
done
yes
i
was
perfectly
unconscious
at
first
that
people
here
were
shy
of
me
that
they
thought
i
was
a
dreadful
sort
of
person
it
seems
they
had
even
refused
to
meet
me
at
dinner
i
found
that
out
afterward
and
how
you
made
your
mother
go
with
you
to
the
van
der
luydens
and
how
you
insisted
on
announcing
your
engagement
at
the
beaufort
ball
so
that
i
might
have
two
families
to
stand
by
me
instead
of
one
at
that
he
broke
into
a
laugh
just
imagine
she
said
how
stupid
and
unobservant
i
was
i
knew
nothing
of
all
this
till
granny
blurted
it
out
one
day
new
york
simply
meant
peace
and
freedom
to
me
it
was
coming
home
and
i
was
so
happy
at
being
among
my
own
people
that
every
one
i
met
seemed
kind
and
good
and
glad
to
see
me
but
from
the
very
beginning
she
continued
i
felt
there
was
no
one
as
kind
as
you
no
one
who
gave
me
reasons
that
i
understood
for
doing
what
at
first
seemed
so
hard
and
unnecessary
the
very
good
people
did
convince
me
i
felt
they
never
been
tempted
but
you
knew
you
understood
you
had
felt
the
world
outside
tugging
at
one
with
all
its
golden
hands
and
yet
you
hated
the
things
it
asks
of
one
you
hated
happiness
bought
by
disloyalty
and
cruelty
and
indifference
that
was
what
i
never
known
before
and
it
better
than
anything
i
known
she
spoke
in
a
low
even
voice
without
tears
or
visible
agitation
and
each
word
as
it
dropped
from
her
fell
into
his
breast
like
burning
lead
he
sat
bowed
over
his
head
between
his
hands
staring
at
the
hearthrug
and
at
the
tip
of
the
satin
shoe
that
showed
under
her
dress
suddenly
he
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
shoe
she
bent
over
him
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
so
deep
that
he
remained
motionless
under
her
gaze
ah
do
let
us
undo
what
you
done
she
cried
i
ca
go
back
now
to
that
other
way
of
thinking
i
ca
love
you
unless
i
give
you
up
his
arms
were
yearning
up
to
her
but
she
drew
away
and
they
remained
facing
each
other
divided
by
the
distance
that
her
words
had
created
then
abruptly
his
anger
overflowed
and
beaufort
is
he
to
replace
me
as
the
words
sprang
out
he
was
prepared
for
an
answering
flare
of
anger
and
he
would
have
welcomed
it
as
fuel
for
his
own
but
madame
olenska
only
grew
a
shade
paler
and
stood
with
her
arms
hanging
down
before
her
and
her
head
slightly
bent
as
her
way
was
when
she
pondered
a
question
he
waiting
for
you
now
at
struthers
why
do
you
go
to
him
archer
sneered
she
turned
to
ring
the
bell
i
shall
not
go
out
this
evening
tell
the
carriage
to
go
and
fetch
the
signora
marchesa
she
said
when
the
maid
came
after
the
door
had
closed
again
archer
continued
to
look
at
her
with
bitter
eyes
why
this
sacrifice
since
you
tell
me
that
lonely
i
no
right
to
keep
you
from
your
friends
she
smiled
a
little
under
her
wet
lashes
i
sha
be
lonely
now
i
was
lonely
i
was
afraid
but
the
emptiness
and
the
darkness
are
gone
when
i
turn
back
into
myself
now
i
like
a
child
going
at
night
into
a
room
where
there
always
a
light
her
tone
and
her
look
still
enveloped
her
in
a
soft
inaccessibility
and
archer
groaned
out
again
i
do
understand
you
yet
you
understand
may
he
reddened
under
the
retort
but
kept
his
eyes
on
her
may
is
ready
to
give
me
up
what
three
days
after
you
entreated
her
on
your
knees
to
hasten
your
marriage
she
refused
that
gives
me
the
right
ah
you
taught
me
what
an
ugly
word
that
is
she
said
he
turned
away
with
a
sense
of
utter
weariness
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
struggling
for
hours
up
the
face
of
a
steep
precipice
and
now
just
as
he
had
fought
his
way
to
the
top
his
hold
had
given
way
and
he
was
pitching
down
headlong
into
darkness
if
he
could
have
got
her
in
his
arms
again
he
might
have
swept
away
her
arguments
but
she
still
held
him
at
a
distance
by
something
inscrutably
aloof
in
her
look
and
attitude
and
by
his
own
awed
sense
of
her
sincerity
at
length
he
began
to
plead
again
if
we
do
this
now
it
will
be
worse
afterward
worse
for
every
one
no
no
no
she
almost
screamed
as
if
he
frightened
her
at
that
moment
the
bell
sent
a
long
tinkle
through
the
house
they
had
heard
no
carriage
stopping
at
the
door
and
they
stood
motionless
looking
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
outside
nastasia
step
crossed
the
hall
the
outer
door
opened
and
a
moment
later
she
came
in
carrying
a
telegram
which
she
handed
to
the
countess
olenska
the
lady
was
very
happy
at
the
flowers
nastasia
said
smoothing
her
apron
she
thought
it
was
her
signor
marito
who
had
sent
them
and
she
cried
a
little
and
said
it
was
a
folly
her
mistress
smiled
and
took
the
yellow
envelope
she
tore
it
open
and
carried
it
to
the
lamp
then
when
the
door
had
closed
again
she
handed
the
telegram
to
archer
it
was
dated
from
augustine
and
addressed
to
the
countess
olenska
in
it
he
read
granny
telegram

newland

too
happy
for
words
and
love

dearly
your
grateful
may
half
an
hour
later
when
archer
unlocked
his
own
he
found
a
similar
envelope
on
the
on
top
of
his
pile
of
notes
and
letters
the
message
inside
the
envelope
was
also
from
may
welland
and
ran
as
follows
parents

easter

so
happy
love

archer
crumpled
up
the
yellow
sheet
as
if
the
gesture
could
annihilate
the
news
it
contained
then
he
pulled
out
a
small
and
turned
over
the
pages
with
trembling
fingers
but
he
did
not
find
what
he
wanted
and
cramming
the
telegram
into
his
pocket
he
mounted
the
stairs
a
light
was
shining
through
the
door
of
the
little
which
served
janey
as
a
and
boudoir
and
her
brother
rapped
impatiently
on
the
panel
the
door
opened
and
his
sister
stood
before
him
in
her
immemorial
purple
flannel
with
her
hair
on
pins
her
face
looked
pale
and
apprehensive
newland
i
hope
there
no
bad
news
in
that
telegram
i
waited
on
purpose
in
case
no
item
of
his
correspondence
was
safe
from
janey
he
took
no
notice
of
her
question
look
here
what
day
is
easter
this
year
she
looked
shocked
at
such
unchristian
ignorance
easter
newland
why
of
course
the
first
week
in
april
why
the
first
week
he
turned
again
to
the
pages
of
his
diary
calculating
rapidly
under
his
breath
the
first
week
did
you
say
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
long
laugh
for
mercy
sake
what
the
matter
nothing
the
matter
except
that
i
going
to
be
married
in
a
month
janey
fell
upon
his
neck
and
pressed
him
to
her
purple
flannel
breast
oh
newland
how
wonderful
i
so
glad
but
dearest
why
do
you
keep
on
laughing
do
hush
or
you
wake
mamma
book
ii
xix
the
day
was
fresh
with
a
lively
spring
wind
full
of
dust
all
the
old
ladies
in
both
families
had
got
out
their
faded
sables
and
yellowing
ermines
and
the
smell
of
camphor
from
the
front
pews
almost
smothered
the
faint
spring
scent
of
the
lilies
banking
the
altar
newland
archer
at
a
signal
from
the
sexton
had
come
out
of
the
vestry
and
placed
himself
with
his
best
man
on
the
chancel
step
of
grace
church
the
signal
meant
that
the
brougham
bearing
the
bride
and
her
father
was
in
sight
but
there
was
sure
to
be
a
considerable
interval
of
adjustment
and
consultation
in
the
lobby
where
the
bridesmaids
were
already
hovering
like
a
cluster
of
easter
blossoms
during
this
unavoidable
lapse
of
time
the
bridegroom
in
proof
of
his
eagerness
was
expected
to
expose
himself
alone
to
the
gaze
of
the
assembled
company
and
archer
had
gone
through
this
formality
as
resignedly
as
through
all
the
others
which
made
of
a
nineteenth
century
new
york
wedding
a
rite
that
seemed
to
belong
to
the
dawn
of
history
everything
was
equally
easy
or
equally
painful
as
one
chose
to
put
it
in
the
path
he
was
committed
to
tread
and
he
had
obeyed
the
flurried
injunctions
of
his
best
man
as
piously
as
other
bridegrooms
had
obeyed
his
own
in
the
days
when
he
had
guided
them
through
the
same
labyrinth
so
far
he
was
reasonably
sure
of
having
fulfilled
all
his
obligations
the
bridesmaids
eight
bouquets
of
white
lilac
and
had
been
sent
in
due
time
as
well
as
the
gold
and
sapphire
of
the
eight
ushers
and
the
best
man
archer
had
sat
up
half
the
night
trying
to
vary
the
wording
of
his
thanks
for
the
last
batch
of
presents
from
men
friends
and
the
fees
for
the
bishop
and
the
rector
were
safely
in
the
pocket
of
his
best
man
his
own
luggage
was
already
at
manson
mingott
where
the
was
to
take
place
and
so
were
the
travelling
clothes
into
which
he
was
to
change
and
a
private
compartment
had
been
engaged
in
the
train
that
was
to
carry
the
young
couple
to
their
unknown
destination
concealment
of
the
spot
in
which
the
bridal
night
was
to
be
spent
being
one
of
the
most
sacred
taboos
of
the
prehistoric
ritual
got
the
ring
all
right
whispered
young
van
der
luyden
newland
who
was
inexperienced
in
the
duties
of
a
best
man
and
awed
by
the
weight
of
his
responsibility
archer
made
the
gesture
which
he
had
seen
so
many
bridegrooms
make
with
his
ungloved
right
hand
he
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
dark
grey
waistcoat
and
assured
himself
that
the
little
gold
circlet
engraved
inside
newland
to
may
april
was
in
its
place
then
resuming
his
former
attitude
his
tall
hat
and
gloves
with
black
stitchings
grasped
in
his
left
hand
he
stood
looking
at
the
door
of
the
church
overhead
handel
march
swelled
pompously
through
the
imitation
stone
vaulting
carrying
on
its
waves
the
faded
drift
of
the
many
weddings
at
which
with
cheerful
indifference
he
had
stood
on
the
same
chancel
step
watching
other
brides
float
up
the
nave
toward
other
bridegrooms
how
like
a
first
night
at
the
opera
he
thought
recognising
all
the
same
faces
in
the
same
boxes
no
pews
and
wondering
if
when
the
last
trump
sounded
selfridge
merry
would
be
there
with
the
same
towering
ostrich
feathers
in
her
bonnet
and
beaufort
with
the
same
diamond
earrings
and
the
same
smile
and
whether
suitable
proscenium
seats
were
already
prepared
for
them
in
another
world
after
that
there
was
still
time
to
review
one
by
one
the
familiar
countenances
in
the
first
rows
the
women
sharp
with
curiosity
and
excitement
the
men
sulky
with
the
obligation
of
having
to
put
on
their
before
luncheon
and
fight
for
food
at
the
too
bad
the
breakfast
is
at
old
catherine
the
bridegroom
could
fancy
reggie
chivers
saying
but
i
told
that
lovell
mingott
insisted
on
its
being
cooked
by
his
own
chef
so
it
ought
to
be
good
if
one
can
only
get
at
it
and
he
could
imagine
sillerton
jackson
adding
with
authority
my
dear
fellow
have
you
heard
it
to
be
served
at
small
tables
in
the
new
english
fashion
archer
eyes
lingered
a
moment
on
the
pew
where
his
mother
who
had
entered
the
church
on
henry
van
der
luyden
arm
sat
weeping
softly
under
her
chantilly
veil
her
hands
in
her
ermine
muff
poor
janey
he
thought
looking
at
his
sister
even
by
screwing
her
head
around
she
can
see
only
the
people
in
the
few
front
pews
and
they
mostly
dowdy
newlands
and
dagonets
on
the
hither
side
of
the
white
ribbon
dividing
off
the
seats
reserved
for
the
families
he
saw
beaufort
tall
and
redfaced
scrutinising
the
women
with
his
arrogant
stare
beside
him
sat
his
wife
all
silvery
chinchilla
and
violets
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
ribbon
lawrence
lefferts
sleekly
brushed
head
seemed
to
mount
guard
over
the
invisible
deity
of
good
form
who
presided
at
the
ceremony
archer
wondered
how
many
flaws
lefferts
keen
eyes
would
discover
in
the
ritual
of
his
divinity
then
he
suddenly
recalled
that
he
too
had
once
thought
such
questions
important
the
things
that
had
filled
his
days
seemed
now
like
a
nursery
parody
of
life
or
like
the
wrangles
of
mediaeval
schoolmen
over
metaphysical
terms
that
nobody
had
ever
understood
a
stormy
discussion
as
to
whether
the
wedding
presents
should
be
shown
had
darkened
the
last
hours
before
the
wedding
and
it
seemed
inconceivable
to
archer
that
people
should
work
themselves
into
a
state
of
agitation
over
such
trifles
and
that
the
matter
should
have
been
decided
in
the
negative
by
saying
with
indignant
tears
i
should
as
soon
turn
the
reporters
loose
in
my
house
yet
there
was
a
time
when
archer
had
had
definite
and
rather
aggressive
opinions
on
all
such
problems
and
when
everything
concerning
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
little
tribe
had
seemed
to
him
fraught
with
significance
and
all
the
while
i
suppose
he
thought
real
people
were
living
somewhere
and
real
things
happening
to
them
there
they
come
breathed
the
best
man
excitedly
but
the
bridegroom
knew
better
the
cautious
opening
of
the
door
of
the
church
meant
only
that
brown
the
keeper
gowned
in
black
in
his
intermittent
character
of
sexton
was
taking
a
preliminary
survey
of
the
scene
before
marshalling
his
forces
the
door
was
softly
shut
again
then
after
another
interval
it
swung
majestically
open
and
a
murmur
ran
through
the
church
the
family
welland
came
first
on
the
arm
of
her
eldest
son
her
large
pink
face
was
appropriately
solemn
and
her
satin
with
pale
blue
and
blue
ostrich
plumes
in
a
small
satin
bonnet
met
with
general
approval
but
before
she
had
settled
herself
with
a
stately
rustle
in
the
pew
opposite
archer
the
spectators
were
craning
their
necks
to
see
who
was
coming
after
her
wild
rumours
had
been
abroad
the
day
before
to
the
effect
that
manson
mingott
in
spite
of
her
physical
disabilities
had
resolved
on
being
present
at
the
ceremony
and
the
idea
was
so
much
in
keeping
with
her
sporting
character
that
bets
ran
high
at
the
clubs
as
to
her
being
able
to
walk
up
the
nave
and
squeeze
into
a
seat
it
was
known
that
she
had
insisted
on
sending
her
own
carpenter
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
taking
down
the
end
panel
of
the
front
pew
and
to
measure
the
space
between
the
seat
and
the
front
but
the
result
had
been
discouraging
and
for
one
anxious
day
her
family
had
watched
her
dallying
with
the
plan
of
being
wheeled
up
the
nave
in
her
enormous
bath
chair
and
sitting
enthroned
in
it
at
the
foot
of
the
chancel
the
idea
of
this
monstrous
exposure
of
her
person
was
so
painful
to
her
relations
that
they
could
have
covered
with
gold
the
ingenious
person
who
suddenly
discovered
that
the
chair
was
too
wide
to
pass
between
the
iron
uprights
of
the
awning
which
extended
from
the
church
door
to
the
curbstone
the
idea
of
doing
away
with
this
awning
and
revealing
the
bride
to
the
mob
of
dressmakers
and
newspaper
reporters
who
stood
outside
fighting
to
get
near
the
joints
of
the
canvas
exceeded
even
old
catherine
courage
though
for
a
moment
she
had
weighed
the
possibility
why
they
might
take
a
photograph
of
my
child
and
put
it
in
the
papers
welland
exclaimed
when
her
mother
last
plan
was
hinted
to
her
and
from
this
unthinkable
indecency
the
clan
recoiled
with
a
collective
shudder
the
ancestress
had
had
to
give
in
but
her
concession
was
bought
only
by
the
promise
that
the
should
take
place
under
her
roof
though
as
the
washington
square
connection
said
with
the
wellands
house
in
easy
reach
it
was
hard
to
have
to
make
a
special
price
with
brown
to
drive
one
to
the
other
end
of
nowhere
though
all
these
transactions
had
been
widely
reported
by
the
jacksons
a
sporting
minority
still
clung
to
the
belief
that
old
catherine
would
appear
in
church
and
there
was
a
distinct
lowering
of
the
temperature
when
she
was
found
to
have
been
replaced
by
her
lovell
mingott
had
the
high
colour
and
glassy
stare
induced
in
ladies
of
her
age
and
habit
by
the
effort
of
getting
into
a
new
dress
but
once
the
disappointment
occasioned
by
her
had
subsided
it
was
agreed
that
her
black
chantilly
over
lilac
satin
with
a
bonnet
of
parma
violets
formed
the
happiest
contrast
to
welland
blue
and
far
different
was
the
impression
produced
by
the
gaunt
and
mincing
lady
who
followed
on
mingott
arm
in
a
wild
dishevelment
of
stripes
and
fringes
and
floating
scarves
and
as
this
last
apparition
glided
into
view
heart
contracted
and
stopped
beating
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
marchioness
manson
was
still
in
washington
where
she
had
gone
some
four
weeks
previously
with
her
niece
madame
olenska
it
was
generally
understood
that
their
abrupt
departure
was
due
to
madame
olenska
desire
to
remove
her
aunt
from
the
baleful
eloquence
of
agathon
carver
who
had
nearly
succeeded
in
enlisting
her
as
a
recruit
for
the
valley
of
love
and
in
the
circumstances
no
one
had
expected
either
of
the
ladies
to
return
for
the
wedding
for
a
moment
archer
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
fantastic
figure
straining
to
see
who
came
behind
her
but
the
little
procession
was
at
an
end
for
all
the
lesser
members
of
the
family
had
taken
their
seats
and
the
eight
tall
ushers
gathering
themselves
together
like
birds
or
insects
preparing
for
some
migratory
manoeuvre
were
already
slipping
through
the
side
doors
into
the
lobby
newland
i
say
she
here
the
best
man
whispered
archer
roused
himself
with
a
start
a
long
time
had
apparently
passed
since
his
heart
had
stopped
beating
for
the
white
and
rosy
procession
was
in
fact
half
way
up
the
nave
the
bishop
the
rector
and
two
assistants
were
hovering
about
the
altar
and
the
first
chords
of
the
spohr
symphony
were
strewing
their
notes
before
the
bride
archer
opened
his
eyes
but
could
they
really
have
been
shut
as
he
imagined
and
felt
his
heart
beginning
to
resume
its
usual
task
the
music
the
scent
of
the
lilies
on
the
altar
the
vision
of
the
cloud
of
tulle
and
floating
nearer
and
nearer
the
sight
of
archer
face
suddenly
convulsed
with
happy
sobs
the
low
benedictory
murmur
of
the
rector
voice
the
ordered
evolutions
of
the
eight
pink
bridesmaids
and
the
eight
black
ushers
all
these
sights
sounds
and
sensations
so
familiar
in
themselves
so
unutterably
strange
and
meaningless
in
his
new
relation
to
them
were
confusedly
mingled
in
his
brain
my
god
he
thought
have
i
got
the
ring
and
once
more
he
went
through
the
bridegroom
convulsive
gesture
then
in
a
moment
may
was
beside
him
such
radiance
streaming
from
her
that
it
sent
a
faint
warmth
through
his
numbness
and
he
straightened
himself
and
smiled
into
her
eyes
dearly
beloved
we
are
gathered
together
here
the
rector
began
the
ring
was
on
her
hand
the
bishop
benediction
had
been
given
the
bridesmaids
were
to
resume
their
place
in
the
procession
and
the
organ
was
showing
preliminary
symptoms
of
breaking
out
into
the
mendelssohn
march
without
which
no
couple
had
ever
emerged
upon
new
york
your
arm
i
say
give
her
your
arm
young
newland
nervously
hissed
and
once
more
archer
became
aware
of
having
been
adrift
far
off
in
the
unknown
what
was
it
that
had
sent
him
there
he
wondered
perhaps
the
glimpse
among
the
anonymous
spectators
in
the
transept
of
a
dark
coil
of
hair
under
a
hat
which
a
moment
later
revealed
itself
as
belonging
to
an
unknown
lady
with
a
long
nose
so
laughably
unlike
the
person
whose
image
she
had
evoked
that
he
asked
himself
if
he
were
becoming
subject
to
hallucinations
and
now
he
and
his
wife
were
pacing
slowly
down
the
nave
carried
forward
on
the
light
mendelssohn
ripples
the
spring
day
beckoning
to
them
through
widely
opened
doors
and
welland
chestnuts
with
big
white
favours
on
their
frontlets
curvetting
and
showing
off
at
the
far
end
of
the
canvas
tunnel
the
footman
who
had
a
still
bigger
white
favour
on
his
lapel
wrapped
may
white
cloak
about
her
and
archer
jumped
into
the
brougham
at
her
side
she
turned
to
him
with
a
triumphant
smile
and
their
hands
clasped
under
her
veil
darling
archer
said
and
suddenly
the
same
black
abyss
yawned
before
him
and
he
felt
himself
sinking
into
it
deeper
and
deeper
while
his
voice
rambled
on
smoothly
and
cheerfully
yes
of
course
i
thought
i
lost
the
ring
no
wedding
would
be
complete
if
the
poor
devil
of
a
bridegroom
did
go
through
that
but
you
did
keep
me
waiting
you
know
i
had
time
to
think
of
every
horror
that
might
possibly
happen
she
surprised
him
by
turning
in
full
fifth
avenue
and
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
but
none
ever
can
happen
now
can
it
newland
as
long
as
we
two
are
together
every
detail
of
the
day
had
been
so
carefully
thought
out
that
the
young
couple
after
the
had
ample
time
to
put
on
their
descend
the
wide
mingott
stairs
between
laughing
bridesmaids
and
weeping
parents
and
get
into
the
brougham
under
the
traditional
shower
of
rice
and
satin
slippers
and
there
was
still
half
an
hour
left
in
which
to
drive
to
the
station
buy
the
last
weeklies
at
the
bookstall
with
the
air
of
seasoned
travellers
and
settle
themselves
in
the
reserved
compartment
in
which
may
maid
had
already
placed
her
travelling
cloak
and
glaringly
new
from
london
the
old
du
lac
aunts
at
rhinebeck
had
put
their
house
at
the
disposal
of
the
bridal
couple
with
a
readiness
inspired
by
the
prospect
of
spending
a
week
in
new
york
with
archer
and
archer
glad
to
escape
the
usual
bridal
suite
in
a
philadelphia
or
baltimore
hotel
had
accepted
with
an
equal
alacrity
may
was
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
going
to
the
country
and
childishly
amused
at
the
vain
efforts
of
the
eight
bridesmaids
to
discover
where
their
mysterious
retreat
was
situated
it
was
thought
very
english
to
have
a
lent
to
one
and
the
fact
gave
a
last
touch
of
distinction
to
what
was
generally
conceded
to
be
the
most
brilliant
wedding
of
the
year
but
where
the
house
was
no
one
was
permitted
to
know
except
the
parents
of
bride
and
groom
who
when
taxed
with
the
knowledge
pursed
their
lips
and
said
mysteriously
ah
they
tell
us
which
was
manifestly
true
since
there
was
no
need
to
once
they
were
settled
in
their
compartment
and
the
train
shaking
off
the
endless
wooden
suburbs
had
pushed
out
into
the
pale
landscape
of
spring
talk
became
easier
than
archer
had
expected
may
was
still
in
look
and
tone
the
simple
girl
of
yesterday
eager
to
compare
notes
with
him
as
to
the
incidents
of
the
wedding
and
discussing
them
as
impartially
as
a
bridesmaid
talking
it
all
over
with
an
usher
at
first
archer
had
fancied
that
this
detachment
was
the
disguise
of
an
inward
tremor
but
her
clear
eyes
revealed
only
the
most
tranquil
unawareness
she
was
alone
for
the
first
time
with
her
husband
but
her
husband
was
only
the
charming
comrade
of
yesterday
there
was
no
one
whom
she
liked
as
much
no
one
whom
she
trusted
as
completely
and
the
culminating
lark
of
the
whole
delightful
adventure
of
engagement
and
marriage
was
to
be
off
with
him
alone
on
a
journey
like
a
grownup
person
like
a
married
woman
in
fact
it
was
wonderful
that
as
he
had
learned
in
the
mission
garden
at
augustine
such
depths
of
feeling
could
coexist
with
such
absence
of
imagination
but
he
remembered
how
even
then
she
had
surprised
him
by
dropping
back
to
inexpressive
girlishness
as
soon
as
her
conscience
had
been
eased
of
its
burden
and
he
saw
that
she
would
probably
go
through
life
dealing
to
the
best
of
her
ability
with
each
experience
as
it
came
but
never
anticipating
any
by
so
much
as
a
stolen
glance
perhaps
that
faculty
of
unawareness
was
what
gave
her
eyes
their
transparency
and
her
face
the
look
of
representing
a
type
rather
than
a
person
as
if
she
might
have
been
chosen
to
pose
for
a
civic
virtue
or
a
greek
goddess
the
blood
that
ran
so
close
to
her
fair
skin
might
have
been
a
preserving
fluid
rather
than
a
ravaging
element
yet
her
look
of
indestructible
youthfulness
made
her
seem
neither
hard
nor
dull
but
only
primitive
and
pure
in
the
thick
of
this
meditation
archer
suddenly
felt
himself
looking
at
her
with
the
startled
gaze
of
a
stranger
and
plunged
into
a
reminiscence
of
the
and
of
granny
mingott
immense
and
triumphant
pervasion
of
it
may
settled
down
to
frank
enjoyment
of
the
subject
i
was
surprised
though
were
you
that
aunt
medora
came
after
all
ellen
wrote
that
they
were
neither
of
them
well
enough
to
take
the
journey
i
do
wish
it
had
been
she
who
had
recovered
did
you
see
the
exquisite
old
lace
she
sent
me
he
had
known
that
the
moment
must
come
sooner
or
later
but
he
had
somewhat
imagined
that
by
force
of
willing
he
might
hold
it
at
bay
yes
i
no
yes
it
was
beautiful
he
said
looking
at
her
blindly
and
wondering
if
whenever
he
heard
those
two
syllables
all
his
carefully
world
would
tumble
about
him
like
a
house
of
cards
are
you
tired
it
will
be
good
to
have
some
tea
when
we
arrive
i
sure
the
aunts
have
got
everything
beautifully
ready
he
rattled
on
taking
her
hand
in
his
and
her
mind
rushed
away
instantly
to
the
magnificent
tea
and
coffee
service
of
baltimore
silver
which
the
beauforts
had
sent
and
which
went
so
perfectly
with
uncle
lovell
mingott
trays
and
in
the
spring
twilight
the
train
stopped
at
the
rhinebeck
station
and
they
walked
along
the
platform
to
the
waiting
carriage
ah
how
awfully
kind
of
the
van
der
luydens
they
sent
their
man
over
from
skuytercliff
to
meet
us
archer
exclaimed
as
a
sedate
person
out
of
livery
approached
them
and
relieved
the
maid
of
her
bags
i
extremely
sorry
sir
said
this
emissary
that
a
little
accident
has
occurred
at
the
miss
du
lacs
a
leak
in
the
it
happened
yesterday
and
van
der
luyden
who
heard
of
it
this
morning
sent
a
housemaid
up
by
the
early
train
to
get
the
house
ready
it
will
be
quite
comfortable
i
think
you
find
sir
and
the
miss
du
lacs
have
sent
their
cook
over
so
that
it
will
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
you
been
at
rhinebeck
archer
stared
at
the
speaker
so
blankly
that
he
repeated
in
still
more
apologetic
accents
it
be
exactly
the
same
sir
i
do
assure
you
and
may
eager
voice
broke
out
covering
the
embarrassed
silence
the
same
as
rhinebeck
the
patroon
house
but
it
will
be
a
hundred
thousand
times
better
wo
it
newland
it
too
dear
and
kind
of
van
der
luyden
to
have
thought
of
it
and
as
they
drove
off
with
the
maid
beside
the
coachman
and
their
shining
bridal
bags
on
the
seat
before
them
she
went
on
excitedly
only
fancy
i
never
been
inside
it
have
you
the
van
der
luydens
show
it
to
so
few
people
but
they
opened
it
for
ellen
it
seems
and
she
told
me
what
a
darling
little
place
it
was
she
says
it
the
only
house
she
seen
in
america
that
she
could
imagine
being
perfectly
happy
in
well
that
what
we
going
to
be
is
it
cried
her
husband
gaily
and
she
answered
with
her
boyish
smile
ah
it
just
our
luck
beginning
the
wonderful
luck
we
always
going
to
have
together
xx
of
course
we
must
dine
with
carfry
dearest
archer
said
and
his
wife
looked
at
him
with
an
anxious
frown
across
the
monumental
britannia
ware
of
their
lodging
house
in
all
the
rainy
desert
of
autumnal
london
there
were
only
two
people
whom
the
newland
archers
knew
and
these
two
they
had
sedulously
avoided
in
conformity
with
the
old
new
york
tradition
that
it
was
not
dignified
to
force
one
self
on
the
notice
of
one
acquaintances
in
foreign
countries
archer
and
janey
in
the
course
of
their
visits
to
europe
had
so
unflinchingly
lived
up
to
this
principle
and
met
the
friendly
advances
of
their
with
an
air
of
such
impenetrable
reserve
that
they
had
almost
achieved
the
record
of
never
having
exchanged
a
word
with
a
foreigner
other
than
those
employed
in
hotels
and
their
own
compatriots
save
those
previously
known
or
properly
accredited
they
treated
with
an
even
more
pronounced
disdain
so
that
unless
they
ran
across
a
chivers
a
dagonet
or
a
mingott
their
months
abroad
were
spent
in
an
unbroken
but
the
utmost
precautions
are
sometimes
unavailing
and
one
night
at
botzen
one
of
the
two
english
ladies
in
the
room
across
the
passage
whose
names
dress
and
social
situation
were
already
intimately
known
to
janey
had
knocked
on
the
door
and
asked
if
archer
had
a
bottle
of
liniment
the
other
lady
the
intruder
sister
carfry
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
attack
of
bronchitis
and
archer
who
never
travelled
without
a
complete
family
pharmacy
was
fortunately
able
to
produce
the
required
remedy
carfry
was
very
ill
and
as
she
and
her
sister
miss
harle
were
travelling
alone
they
were
profoundly
grateful
to
the
archer
ladies
who
supplied
them
with
ingenious
comforts
and
whose
efficient
maid
helped
to
nurse
the
invalid
back
to
health
when
the
archers
left
botzen
they
had
no
idea
of
ever
seeing
carfry
and
miss
harle
again
nothing
to
archer
mind
would
have
been
more
undignified
than
to
force
one
self
on
the
notice
of
a
foreigner
to
whom
one
had
happened
to
render
an
accidental
service
but
carfry
and
her
sister
to
whom
this
point
of
view
was
unknown
and
who
would
have
found
it
utterly
incomprehensible
felt
themselves
linked
by
an
eternal
gratitude
to
the
delightful
americans
who
had
been
so
kind
at
botzen
with
touching
fidelity
they
seized
every
chance
of
meeting
archer
and
janey
in
the
course
of
their
continental
travels
and
displayed
a
supernatural
acuteness
in
finding
out
when
they
were
to
pass
through
london
on
their
way
to
or
from
the
states
the
intimacy
became
indissoluble
and
archer
and
janey
whenever
they
alighted
at
brown
hotel
found
themselves
awaited
by
two
affectionate
friends
who
like
themselves
cultivated
ferns
in
wardian
cases
made
macrame
lace
read
the
memoirs
of
the
baroness
bunsen
and
had
views
about
the
occupants
of
the
leading
london
pulpits
as
archer
said
it
made
another
thing
of
london
to
know
carfry
and
miss
harle
and
by
the
time
that
newland
became
engaged
the
tie
between
the
families
was
so
firmly
established
that
it
was
thought
only
right
to
send
a
wedding
invitation
to
the
two
english
ladies
who
sent
in
return
a
pretty
bouquet
of
pressed
alpine
flowers
under
glass
and
on
the
dock
when
newland
and
his
wife
sailed
for
england
archer
last
word
had
been
you
must
take
may
to
see
mrs
carfry
newland
and
his
wife
had
had
no
idea
of
obeying
this
injunction
but
carfry
with
her
usual
acuteness
had
run
them
down
and
sent
them
an
invitation
to
dine
and
it
was
over
this
invitation
that
may
archer
was
wrinkling
her
brows
across
the
tea
and
muffins
it
all
very
well
for
you
newland
you
know
them
but
i
shall
feel
so
shy
among
a
lot
of
people
i
never
met
and
what
shall
i
wear
newland
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
at
her
she
looked
handsomer
and
more
than
ever
the
moist
english
air
seemed
to
have
deepened
the
bloom
of
her
cheeks
and
softened
the
slight
hardness
of
her
virginal
features
or
else
it
was
simply
the
inner
glow
of
happiness
shining
through
like
a
light
under
ice
wear
dearest
i
thought
a
trunkful
of
things
had
come
from
paris
last
week
yes
of
course
i
meant
to
say
that
i
sha
know
which
to
wear
she
pouted
a
little
i
never
dined
out
in
london
and
i
do
want
to
be
ridiculous
he
tried
to
enter
into
her
perplexity
but
do
englishwomen
dress
just
like
everybody
else
in
the
evening
newland
how
can
you
ask
such
funny
questions
when
they
go
to
the
theatre
in
old
and
bare
heads
well
perhaps
they
wear
new
at
home
but
at
any
rate
carfry
and
miss
harle
wo
they
wear
caps
like
my
mother
and
shawls
very
soft
shawls
yes
but
how
will
the
other
women
be
dressed
not
as
well
as
you
dear
he
rejoined
wondering
what
had
suddenly
developed
in
her
janey
morbid
interest
in
clothes
she
pushed
back
her
chair
with
a
sigh
that
dear
of
you
newland
but
it
does
help
me
much
he
had
an
inspiration
why
not
wear
your
that
be
wrong
can
it
oh
dearest
if
i
only
had
it
here
but
it
gone
to
paris
to
be
made
over
for
next
winter
and
worth
has
sent
it
back
oh
well
said
archer
getting
up
look
here
the
fog
lifting
if
we
made
a
dash
for
the
national
gallery
we
might
manage
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
pictures
the
newland
archers
were
on
their
way
home
after
a
three
which
may
in
writing
to
her
girl
friends
vaguely
summarised
as
blissful
they
had
not
gone
to
the
italian
lakes
on
reflection
archer
had
not
been
able
to
picture
his
wife
in
that
particular
setting
her
own
inclination
after
a
month
with
the
paris
dressmakers
was
for
mountaineering
in
july
and
swimming
in
august
this
plan
they
punctually
fulfilled
spending
july
at
interlaken
and
grindelwald
and
august
at
a
little
place
called
etretat
on
the
normandy
coast
which
some
one
had
recommended
as
quaint
and
quiet
once
or
twice
in
the
mountains
archer
had
pointed
southward
and
said
there
italy
and
may
her
feet
in
a
had
smiled
cheerfully
and
replied
it
would
be
lovely
to
go
there
next
winter
if
only
you
did
have
to
be
in
new
york
but
in
reality
travelling
interested
her
even
less
than
he
had
expected
she
regarded
it
once
her
clothes
were
ordered
as
merely
an
enlarged
opportunity
for
walking
riding
swimming
and
trying
her
hand
at
the
fascinating
new
game
of
lawn
tennis
and
when
they
finally
got
back
to
london
where
they
were
to
spend
a
fortnight
while
he
ordered
his
clothes
she
no
longer
concealed
the
eagerness
with
which
she
looked
forward
to
sailing
in
london
nothing
interested
her
but
the
theatres
and
the
shops
and
she
found
the
theatres
less
exciting
than
the
paris
cafes
chantants
where
under
the
blossoming
of
the
champs
elysees
she
had
had
the
novel
experience
of
looking
down
from
the
restaurant
terrace
on
an
audience
of
cocottes
and
having
her
husband
interpret
to
her
as
much
of
the
songs
as
he
thought
suitable
for
bridal
ears
archer
had
reverted
to
all
his
old
inherited
ideas
about
marriage
it
was
less
trouble
to
conform
with
the
tradition
and
treat
may
exactly
as
all
his
friends
treated
their
wives
than
to
try
to
put
into
practice
the
theories
with
which
his
untrammelled
bachelorhood
had
dallied
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
emancipate
a
wife
who
had
not
the
dimmest
notion
that
she
was
not
free
and
he
had
long
since
discovered
that
may
only
use
of
the
liberty
she
supposed
herself
to
possess
would
be
to
lay
it
on
the
altar
of
her
wifely
adoration
her
innate
dignity
would
always
keep
her
from
making
the
gift
abjectly
and
a
day
might
even
come
as
it
once
had
when
she
would
find
strength
to
take
it
altogether
back
if
she
thought
she
were
doing
it
for
his
own
good
but
with
a
conception
of
marriage
so
uncomplicated
and
incurious
as
hers
such
a
crisis
could
be
brought
about
only
by
something
visibly
outrageous
in
his
own
conduct
and
the
fineness
of
her
feeling
for
him
made
that
unthinkable
whatever
happened
he
knew
she
would
always
be
loyal
gallant
and
unresentful
and
that
pledged
him
to
the
practice
of
the
same
virtues
all
this
tended
to
draw
him
back
into
his
old
habits
of
mind
if
her
simplicity
had
been
the
simplicity
of
pettiness
he
would
have
chafed
and
rebelled
but
since
the
lines
of
her
character
though
so
few
were
on
the
same
fine
mould
as
her
face
she
became
the
tutelary
divinity
of
all
his
old
traditions
and
reverences
such
qualities
were
scarcely
of
the
kind
to
enliven
foreign
travel
though
they
made
her
so
easy
and
pleasant
a
companion
but
he
saw
at
once
how
they
would
fall
into
place
in
their
proper
setting
he
had
no
fear
of
being
oppressed
by
them
for
his
artistic
and
intellectual
life
would
go
on
as
it
always
had
outside
the
domestic
circle
and
within
it
there
would
be
nothing
small
and
stifling
coming
back
to
his
wife
would
never
be
like
entering
a
stuffy
room
after
a
tramp
in
the
open
and
when
they
had
children
the
vacant
corners
in
both
their
lives
would
be
filled
all
these
things
went
through
his
mind
during
their
long
slow
drive
from
mayfair
to
south
kensington
where
carfry
and
her
sister
lived
archer
too
would
have
preferred
to
escape
their
hospitality
in
conformity
with
the
family
tradition
he
had
always
travelled
as
a
and
affecting
a
haughty
unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
his
once
only
just
after
harvard
he
had
spent
a
few
gay
weeks
at
florence
with
a
band
of
queer
europeanised
americans
dancing
all
night
with
titled
ladies
in
palaces
and
gambling
half
the
day
with
the
rakes
and
dandies
of
the
fashionable
club
but
it
had
all
seemed
to
him
though
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
as
unreal
as
a
carnival
these
queer
cosmopolitan
women
deep
in
complicated
which
they
appeared
to
feel
the
need
of
retailing
to
every
one
they
met
and
the
magnificent
young
officers
and
elderly
dyed
wits
who
were
the
subjects
or
the
recipients
of
their
confidences
were
too
different
from
the
people
archer
had
grown
up
among
too
much
like
expensive
and
rather
malodorous
exotics
to
detain
his
imagination
long
to
introduce
his
wife
into
such
a
society
was
out
of
the
question
and
in
the
course
of
his
travels
no
other
had
shown
any
marked
eagerness
for
his
company
not
long
after
their
arrival
in
london
he
had
run
across
the
duke
of
austrey
and
the
duke
instantly
and
cordially
recognising
him
had
said
look
me
up
wo
you
but
no
american
would
have
considered
that
a
suggestion
to
be
acted
on
and
the
meeting
was
without
a
sequel
they
had
even
managed
to
avoid
may
english
aunt
the
banker
wife
who
was
still
in
yorkshire
in
fact
they
had
purposely
postponed
going
to
london
till
the
autumn
in
order
that
their
arrival
during
the
season
might
not
appear
pushing
and
snobbish
to
these
unknown
relatives
probably
there
be
nobody
at
carfry
london
a
desert
at
this
season
and
you
made
yourself
much
too
beautiful
archer
said
to
may
who
sat
at
his
side
in
the
hansom
so
spotlessly
splendid
in
her
cloak
edged
with
swansdown
that
it
seemed
wicked
to
expose
her
to
the
london
grime
i
do
want
them
to
think
that
we
dress
like
savages
she
replied
with
a
scorn
that
pocahontas
might
have
resented
and
he
was
struck
again
by
the
religious
reverence
of
even
the
most
unworldly
american
women
for
the
social
advantages
of
dress
it
their
armour
he
thought
their
defence
against
the
unknown
and
their
defiance
of
it
and
he
understood
for
the
first
time
the
earnestness
with
which
may
who
was
incapable
of
tying
a
ribbon
in
her
hair
to
charm
him
had
gone
through
the
solemn
rite
of
selecting
and
ordering
her
extensive
wardrobe
he
had
been
right
in
expecting
the
party
at
carfry
to
be
a
small
one
besides
their
hostess
and
her
sister
they
found
in
the
long
chilly
only
another
shawled
lady
a
genial
vicar
who
was
her
husband
a
silent
lad
whom
carfry
named
as
her
nephew
and
a
small
dark
gentleman
with
lively
eyes
whom
she
introduced
as
his
tutor
pronouncing
a
french
name
as
she
did
so
into
this
and
group
may
archer
floated
like
a
swan
with
the
sunset
on
her
she
seemed
larger
fairer
more
voluminously
rustling
than
her
husband
had
ever
seen
her
and
he
perceived
that
the
rosiness
and
rustlingness
were
the
tokens
of
an
extreme
and
infantile
shyness
what
on
earth
will
they
expect
me
to
talk
about
her
helpless
eyes
implored
him
at
the
very
moment
that
her
dazzling
apparition
was
calling
forth
the
same
anxiety
in
their
own
bosoms
but
beauty
even
when
distrustful
of
itself
awakens
confidence
in
the
manly
heart
and
the
vicar
and
the
tutor
were
soon
manifesting
to
may
their
desire
to
put
her
at
her
ease
in
spite
of
their
best
efforts
however
the
dinner
was
a
languishing
affair
archer
noticed
that
his
wife
way
of
showing
herself
at
her
ease
with
foreigners
was
to
become
more
uncompromisingly
local
in
her
references
so
that
though
her
loveliness
was
an
encouragement
to
admiration
her
conversation
was
a
chill
to
repartee
the
vicar
soon
abandoned
the
struggle
but
the
tutor
who
spoke
the
most
fluent
and
accomplished
english
gallantly
continued
to
pour
it
out
to
her
until
the
ladies
to
the
manifest
relief
of
all
concerned
went
up
to
the
the
vicar
after
a
glass
of
port
was
obliged
to
hurry
away
to
a
meeting
and
the
shy
nephew
who
appeared
to
be
an
invalid
was
packed
off
to
bed
but
archer
and
the
tutor
continued
to
sit
over
their
wine
and
suddenly
archer
found
himself
talking
as
he
had
not
done
since
his
last
symposium
with
ned
winsett
the
carfry
nephew
it
turned
out
had
been
threatened
with
consumption
and
had
had
to
leave
harrow
for
switzerland
where
he
had
spent
two
years
in
the
milder
air
of
lake
leman
being
a
bookish
youth
he
had
been
entrusted
to
riviere
who
had
brought
him
back
to
england
and
was
to
remain
with
him
till
he
went
up
to
oxford
the
following
spring
and
riviere
added
with
simplicity
that
he
should
then
have
to
look
out
for
another
job
it
seemed
impossible
archer
thought
that
he
should
be
long
without
one
so
varied
were
his
interests
and
so
many
his
gifts
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
with
a
thin
ugly
face
may
would
certainly
have
called
him
to
which
the
play
of
his
ideas
gave
an
intense
expressiveness
but
there
was
nothing
frivolous
or
cheap
in
his
animation
his
father
who
had
died
young
had
filled
a
small
diplomatic
post
and
it
had
been
intended
that
the
son
should
follow
the
same
career
but
an
insatiable
taste
for
letters
had
thrown
the
young
man
into
journalism
then
into
authorship
apparently
unsuccessful
and
at
length
after
other
experiments
and
vicissitudes
which
he
spared
his
listener
into
tutoring
english
youths
in
switzerland
before
that
however
he
had
lived
much
in
paris
frequented
the
goncourt
grenier
been
advised
by
maupassant
not
to
attempt
to
write
even
that
seemed
to
archer
a
dazzling
honour
and
had
often
talked
with
merimee
in
his
house
he
had
obviously
always
been
desperately
poor
and
anxious
having
a
mother
and
an
unmarried
sister
to
provide
for
and
it
was
apparent
that
his
literary
ambitions
had
failed
his
situation
in
fact
seemed
materially
speaking
no
more
brilliant
than
ned
winsett
but
he
had
lived
in
a
world
in
which
as
he
said
no
one
who
loved
ideas
need
hunger
mentally
as
it
was
precisely
of
that
love
that
poor
winsett
was
starving
to
death
archer
looked
with
a
sort
of
vicarious
envy
at
this
eager
impecunious
young
man
who
had
fared
so
richly
in
his
poverty
you
see
monsieur
it
worth
everything
is
it
to
keep
intellectual
liberty
not
to
enslave
one
powers
of
appreciation
one
critical
independence
it
was
because
of
that
that
i
abandoned
journalism
and
took
to
so
much
duller
work
tutoring
and
private
secretaryship
there
is
a
good
deal
of
drudgery
of
course
but
one
preserves
one
moral
freedom
what
we
call
in
french
one
quant
a
soi
and
when
one
hears
good
talk
one
can
join
in
it
without
compromising
any
opinions
but
one
own
or
one
can
listen
and
answer
it
inwardly
ah
good
conversation
there
nothing
like
it
is
there
the
air
of
ideas
is
the
only
air
worth
breathing
and
so
i
have
never
regretted
giving
up
either
diplomacy
or
journalism
two
different
forms
of
the
same
he
fixed
his
vivid
eyes
on
archer
as
he
lit
another
cigarette
monsieur
to
be
able
to
look
life
in
the
face
that
worth
living
in
a
garret
for
is
it
but
after
all
one
must
earn
enough
to
pay
for
the
garret
and
i
confess
that
to
grow
old
as
a
private
tutor
or
a
anything
is
almost
as
chilling
to
the
imagination
as
a
second
secretaryship
at
bucharest
sometimes
i
feel
i
must
make
a
plunge
an
immense
plunge
do
you
suppose
for
instance
there
would
be
any
opening
for
me
in
america
in
new
york
archer
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
new
york
for
a
young
man
who
had
frequented
the
goncourts
and
flaubert
and
who
thought
the
life
of
ideas
the
only
one
worth
living
he
continued
to
stare
at
riviere
perplexedly
wondering
how
to
tell
him
that
his
very
superiorities
and
advantages
would
be
the
surest
hindrance
to
success
new
york
new
york
but
must
it
be
especially
new
york
he
stammered
utterly
unable
to
imagine
what
lucrative
opening
his
native
city
could
offer
to
a
young
man
to
whom
good
conversation
appeared
to
be
the
only
necessity
a
sudden
flush
rose
under
riviere
sallow
skin
i
i
thought
it
your
metropolis
is
not
the
intellectual
life
more
active
there
he
rejoined
then
as
if
fearing
to
give
his
hearer
the
impression
of
having
asked
a
favour
he
went
on
hastily
one
throws
out
random
suggestions
more
to
one
self
than
to
others
in
reality
i
see
no
immediate
prospect
and
rising
from
his
seat
he
added
without
a
trace
of
constraint
but
carfry
will
think
that
i
ought
to
be
taking
you
upstairs
during
the
homeward
drive
archer
pondered
deeply
on
this
episode
his
hour
with
riviere
had
put
new
air
into
his
lungs
and
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
invite
him
to
dine
the
next
day
but
he
was
beginning
to
understand
why
married
men
did
not
always
immediately
yield
to
their
first
impulses
that
young
tutor
is
an
interesting
fellow
we
had
some
awfully
good
talk
after
dinner
about
books
and
things
he
threw
out
tentatively
in
the
hansom
may
roused
herself
from
one
of
the
dreamy
silences
into
which
he
had
read
so
many
meanings
before
six
months
of
marriage
had
given
him
the
key
to
them
the
little
frenchman
was
he
dreadfully
common
she
questioned
coldly
and
he
guessed
that
she
nursed
a
secret
disappointment
at
having
been
invited
out
in
london
to
meet
a
clergyman
and
a
french
tutor
the
disappointment
was
not
occasioned
by
the
sentiment
ordinarily
defined
as
snobbishness
but
by
old
new
york
sense
of
what
was
due
to
it
when
it
risked
its
dignity
in
foreign
lands
if
parents
had
entertained
the
carfrys
in
fifth
avenue
they
would
have
offered
them
something
more
substantial
than
a
parson
and
a
schoolmaster
but
archer
was
on
edge
and
took
her
up
common
common
where
he
queried
and
she
returned
with
unusual
readiness
why
i
should
say
anywhere
but
in
his
those
people
are
always
awkward
in
society
but
then
she
added
disarmingly
i
suppose
i
should
have
known
if
he
was
clever
archer
disliked
her
use
of
the
word
clever
almost
as
much
as
her
use
of
the
word
common
but
he
was
beginning
to
fear
his
tendency
to
dwell
on
the
things
he
disliked
in
her
after
all
her
point
of
view
had
always
been
the
same
it
was
that
of
all
the
people
he
had
grown
up
among
and
he
had
always
regarded
it
as
necessary
but
negligible
until
a
few
months
ago
he
had
never
known
a
nice
woman
who
looked
at
life
differently
and
if
a
man
married
it
must
necessarily
be
among
the
nice
ah
then
i
wo
ask
him
to
dine
he
concluded
with
a
laugh
and
may
echoed
bewildered
goodness
ask
the
carfrys
tutor
well
not
on
the
same
day
with
the
carfrys
if
you
prefer
i
should
but
i
did
rather
want
another
talk
with
him
he
looking
for
a
job
in
new
york
her
surprise
increased
with
her
indifference
he
almost
fancied
that
she
suspected
him
of
being
tainted
with
foreignness
a
job
in
new
york
what
sort
of
a
job
people
do
have
french
tutors
what
does
he
want
to
do
chiefly
to
enjoy
good
conversation
i
understand
her
husband
retorted
perversely
and
she
broke
into
an
appreciative
laugh
oh
newland
how
funny
is
that
french
on
the
whole
he
was
glad
to
have
the
matter
settled
for
him
by
her
refusing
to
take
seriously
his
wish
to
invite
riviere
another
talk
would
have
made
it
difficult
to
avoid
the
question
of
new
york
and
the
more
archer
considered
it
the
less
he
was
able
to
fit
riviere
into
any
conceivable
picture
of
new
york
as
he
knew
it
he
perceived
with
a
flash
of
chilling
insight
that
in
future
many
problems
would
be
thus
negatively
solved
for
him
but
as
he
paid
the
hansom
and
followed
his
wife
long
train
into
the
house
he
took
refuge
in
the
comforting
platitude
that
the
first
six
months
were
always
the
most
difficult
in
marriage
after
that
i
suppose
we
shall
have
pretty
nearly
finished
rubbing
off
each
other
angles
he
reflected
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
may
pressure
was
already
bearing
on
the
very
angles
whose
sharpness
he
most
wanted
to
keep
xxi
the
small
bright
lawn
stretched
away
smoothly
to
the
big
bright
sea
the
turf
was
hemmed
with
an
edge
of
scarlet
geranium
and
coleus
and
vases
painted
in
chocolate
colour
standing
at
intervals
along
the
winding
path
that
led
to
the
sea
looped
their
garlands
of
petunia
and
ivy
geranium
above
the
neatly
raked
gravel
half
way
between
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
the
square
wooden
house
which
was
also
but
with
the
tin
roof
of
the
verandah
striped
in
yellow
and
brown
to
represent
an
awning
two
large
targets
had
been
placed
against
a
background
of
shrubbery
on
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
facing
the
targets
was
pitched
a
real
tent
with
benches
and
about
it
a
number
of
ladies
in
summer
dresses
and
gentlemen
in
grey
and
tall
hats
stood
on
the
lawn
or
sat
upon
the
benches
and
every
now
and
then
a
slender
girl
in
starched
muslin
would
step
from
the
tent
bow
in
hand
and
speed
her
shaft
at
one
of
the
targets
while
the
spectators
interrupted
their
talk
to
watch
the
result
newland
archer
standing
on
the
verandah
of
the
house
looked
curiously
down
upon
this
scene
on
each
side
of
the
shiny
painted
steps
was
a
large
blue
china
on
a
bright
yellow
china
stand
a
spiky
green
plant
filled
each
pot
and
below
the
verandah
ran
a
wide
border
of
blue
hydrangeas
edged
with
more
red
geraniums
behind
him
the
french
windows
of
the
through
which
he
had
passed
gave
glimpses
between
swaying
lace
curtains
of
glassy
parquet
floors
islanded
with
chintz
poufs
dwarf
armchairs
and
velvet
tables
covered
with
trifles
in
silver
the
newport
archery
club
always
held
its
august
meeting
at
the
beauforts
the
sport
which
had
hitherto
known
no
rival
but
croquet
was
beginning
to
be
discarded
in
favour
of
but
the
latter
game
was
still
considered
too
rough
and
inelegant
for
social
occasions
and
as
an
opportunity
to
show
off
pretty
dresses
and
graceful
attitudes
the
bow
and
arrow
held
their
own
archer
looked
down
with
wonder
at
the
familiar
spectacle
it
surprised
him
that
life
should
be
going
on
in
the
old
way
when
his
own
reactions
to
it
had
so
completely
changed
it
was
newport
that
had
first
brought
home
to
him
the
extent
of
the
change
in
new
york
during
the
previous
winter
after
he
and
may
had
settled
down
in
the
new
house
with
the
and
the
pompeian
vestibule
he
had
dropped
back
with
relief
into
the
old
routine
of
the
office
and
the
renewal
of
this
daily
activity
had
served
as
a
link
with
his
former
self
then
there
had
been
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
choosing
a
showy
grey
stepper
for
may
brougham
the
wellands
had
given
the
carriage
and
the
abiding
occupation
and
interest
of
arranging
his
new
library
which
in
spite
of
family
doubts
and
disapprovals
had
been
carried
out
as
he
had
dreamed
with
a
dark
embossed
paper
eastlake
and
sincere
and
tables
at
the
century
he
had
found
winsett
again
and
at
the
knickerbocker
the
fashionable
young
men
of
his
own
set
and
what
with
the
hours
dedicated
to
the
law
and
those
given
to
dining
out
or
entertaining
friends
at
home
with
an
occasional
evening
at
the
opera
or
the
play
the
life
he
was
living
had
still
seemed
a
fairly
real
and
inevitable
sort
of
business
but
newport
represented
the
escape
from
duty
into
an
atmosphere
of
unmitigated
archer
had
tried
to
persuade
may
to
spend
the
summer
on
a
remote
island
off
the
coast
of
maine
called
appropriately
enough
mount
desert
where
a
few
hardy
bostonians
and
philadelphians
were
camping
in
native
cottages
and
whence
came
reports
of
enchanting
scenery
and
a
wild
almost
existence
amid
woods
and
waters
but
the
wellands
always
went
to
newport
where
they
owned
one
of
the
square
boxes
on
the
cliffs
and
their
could
adduce
no
good
reason
why
he
and
may
should
not
join
them
there
as
welland
rather
tartly
pointed
out
it
was
hardly
worth
while
for
may
to
have
worn
herself
out
trying
on
summer
clothes
in
paris
if
she
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
wear
them
and
this
argument
was
of
a
kind
to
which
archer
had
as
yet
found
no
answer
may
herself
could
not
understand
his
obscure
reluctance
to
fall
in
with
so
reasonable
and
pleasant
a
way
of
spending
the
summer
she
reminded
him
that
he
had
always
liked
newport
in
his
bachelor
days
and
as
this
was
indisputable
he
could
only
profess
that
he
was
sure
he
was
going
to
like
it
better
than
ever
now
that
they
were
to
be
there
together
but
as
he
stood
on
the
beaufort
verandah
and
looked
out
on
the
brightly
peopled
lawn
it
came
home
to
him
with
a
shiver
that
he
was
not
going
to
like
it
at
all
it
was
not
may
fault
poor
dear
if
now
and
then
during
their
travels
they
had
fallen
slightly
out
of
step
harmony
had
been
restored
by
their
return
to
the
conditions
she
was
used
to
he
had
always
foreseen
that
she
would
not
disappoint
him
and
he
had
been
right
he
had
married
as
most
young
men
did
because
he
had
met
a
perfectly
charming
girl
at
the
moment
when
a
series
of
rather
aimless
sentimental
adventures
were
ending
in
premature
disgust
and
she
had
represented
peace
stability
comradeship
and
the
steadying
sense
of
an
unescapable
duty
he
could
not
say
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
his
choice
for
she
had
fulfilled
all
that
he
had
expected
it
was
undoubtedly
gratifying
to
be
the
husband
of
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
popular
young
married
women
in
new
york
especially
when
she
was
also
one
of
the
and
most
reasonable
of
wives
and
archer
had
never
been
insensible
to
such
advantages
as
for
the
momentary
madness
which
had
fallen
upon
him
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
he
had
trained
himself
to
regard
it
as
the
last
of
his
discarded
experiments
the
idea
that
he
could
ever
in
his
senses
have
dreamed
of
marrying
the
countess
olenska
had
become
almost
unthinkable
and
she
remained
in
his
memory
simply
as
the
most
plaintive
and
poignant
of
a
line
of
ghosts
but
all
these
abstractions
and
eliminations
made
of
his
mind
a
rather
empty
and
echoing
place
and
he
supposed
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
busy
animated
people
on
the
beaufort
lawn
shocked
him
as
if
they
had
been
children
playing
in
a
he
heard
a
murmur
of
skirts
beside
him
and
the
marchioness
manson
fluttered
out
of
the
window
as
usual
she
was
extraordinarily
festooned
and
bedizened
with
a
limp
leghorn
hat
anchored
to
her
head
by
many
windings
of
faded
gauze
and
a
little
black
velvet
parasol
on
a
carved
ivory
handle
absurdly
balanced
over
her
much
larger
hatbrim
my
dear
newland
i
had
no
idea
that
you
and
may
had
arrived
you
yourself
came
only
yesterday
you
say
ah
business
business
professional
duties
i
understand
many
husbands
i
know
find
it
impossible
to
join
their
wives
here
except
for
the
she
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
and
languished
at
him
through
eyes
but
marriage
is
one
long
sacrifice
as
i
used
often
to
remind
my
ellen
archer
heart
stopped
with
the
queer
jerk
which
it
had
given
once
before
and
which
seemed
suddenly
to
slam
a
door
between
himself
and
the
outer
world
but
this
break
of
continuity
must
have
been
of
the
briefest
for
he
presently
heard
medora
answering
a
question
he
had
apparently
found
voice
to
put
no
i
am
not
staying
here
but
with
the
blenkers
in
their
delicious
solitude
at
portsmouth
beaufort
was
kind
enough
to
send
his
famous
trotters
for
me
this
morning
so
that
i
might
have
at
least
a
glimpse
of
one
of
regina
but
this
evening
i
go
back
to
rural
life
the
blenkers
dear
original
beings
have
hired
a
primitive
old
at
portsmouth
where
they
gather
about
them
representative
people
she
drooped
slightly
beneath
her
protecting
brim
and
added
with
a
faint
blush
this
week
agathon
carver
is
holding
a
series
of
inner
thought
meetings
there
a
contrast
indeed
to
this
gay
scene
of
worldly
pleasure
but
then
i
have
always
lived
on
contrasts
to
me
the
only
death
is
monotony
i
always
say
to
ellen
beware
of
monotony
it
the
mother
of
all
the
deadly
sins
but
my
poor
child
is
going
through
a
phase
of
exaltation
of
abhorrence
of
the
world
you
know
i
suppose
that
she
has
declined
all
invitations
to
stay
at
newport
even
with
her
grandmother
mingott
i
could
hardly
persuade
her
to
come
with
me
to
the
blenkers
if
you
will
believe
it
the
life
she
leads
is
morbid
unnatural
ah
if
she
had
only
listened
to
me
when
it
was
still
possible
when
the
door
was
still
open
but
shall
we
go
down
and
watch
this
absorbing
match
i
hear
your
may
is
one
of
the
competitors
strolling
toward
them
from
the
tent
beaufort
advanced
over
the
lawn
tall
heavy
too
tightly
buttoned
into
a
london
with
one
of
his
own
orchids
in
its
buttonhole
archer
who
had
not
seen
him
for
two
or
three
months
was
struck
by
the
change
in
his
appearance
in
the
hot
summer
light
his
floridness
seemed
heavy
and
bloated
and
but
for
his
erect
walk
he
would
have
looked
like
an
and
old
man
there
were
all
sorts
of
rumours
afloat
about
beaufort
in
the
spring
he
had
gone
off
on
a
long
cruise
to
the
west
indies
in
his
new
and
it
was
reported
that
at
various
points
where
he
had
touched
a
lady
resembling
miss
fanny
ring
had
been
seen
in
his
company
the
built
in
the
clyde
and
fitted
with
tiled
and
other
luxuries
was
said
to
have
cost
him
half
a
million
and
the
pearl
necklace
which
he
had
presented
to
his
wife
on
his
return
was
as
magnificent
as
such
expiatory
offerings
are
apt
to
be
beaufort
fortune
was
substantial
enough
to
stand
the
strain
and
yet
the
disquieting
rumours
persisted
not
only
in
fifth
avenue
but
in
wall
street
some
people
said
he
had
speculated
unfortunately
in
railways
others
that
he
was
being
bled
by
one
of
the
most
insatiable
members
of
her
profession
and
to
every
report
of
threatened
insolvency
beaufort
replied
by
a
fresh
extravagance
the
building
of
a
new
row
of
the
purchase
of
a
new
string
of
or
the
addition
of
a
new
meissonnier
or
cabanel
to
his
he
advanced
toward
the
marchioness
and
newland
with
his
usual
smile
hullo
medora
did
the
trotters
do
their
business
forty
minutes
eh
well
that
not
so
bad
considering
your
nerves
had
to
be
spared
he
shook
hands
with
archer
and
then
turning
back
with
them
placed
himself
on
manson
other
side
and
said
in
a
low
voice
a
few
words
which
their
companion
did
not
catch
the
marchioness
replied
by
one
of
her
queer
foreign
jerks
and
a
que
which
deepened
beaufort
frown
but
he
produced
a
good
semblance
of
a
congratulatory
smile
as
he
glanced
at
archer
to
say
you
know
may
going
to
carry
off
the
first
prize
ah
then
it
remains
in
the
family
medora
rippled
and
at
that
moment
they
reached
the
tent
and
beaufort
met
them
in
a
girlish
cloud
of
mauve
muslin
and
floating
veils
may
welland
was
just
coming
out
of
the
tent
in
her
white
dress
with
a
pale
green
ribbon
about
the
waist
and
a
wreath
of
ivy
on
her
hat
she
had
the
same
aloofness
as
when
she
had
entered
the
beaufort
on
the
night
of
her
engagement
in
the
interval
not
a
thought
seemed
to
have
passed
behind
her
eyes
or
a
feeling
through
her
heart
and
though
her
husband
knew
that
she
had
the
capacity
for
both
he
marvelled
afresh
at
the
way
in
which
experience
dropped
away
from
her
she
had
her
bow
and
arrow
in
her
hand
and
placing
herself
on
the
traced
on
the
turf
she
lifted
the
bow
to
her
shoulder
and
took
aim
the
attitude
was
so
full
of
a
classic
grace
that
a
murmur
of
appreciation
followed
her
appearance
and
archer
felt
the
glow
of
proprietorship
that
so
often
cheated
him
into
momentary
her
rivals
reggie
chivers
the
merry
girls
and
divers
rosy
thorleys
dagonets
and
mingotts
stood
behind
her
in
a
lovely
anxious
group
brown
heads
and
golden
bent
above
the
scores
and
pale
muslins
and
hats
mingled
in
a
tender
rainbow
all
were
young
and
pretty
and
bathed
in
summer
bloom
but
not
one
had
the
ease
of
his
wife
when
with
tense
muscles
and
happy
frown
she
bent
her
soul
upon
some
feat
of
strength
gad
archer
heard
lawrence
lefferts
say
not
one
of
the
lot
holds
the
bow
as
she
does
and
beaufort
retorted
yes
but
that
the
only
kind
of
target
she
ever
hit
archer
felt
irrationally
angry
his
host
contemptuous
tribute
to
may
niceness
was
just
what
a
husband
should
have
wished
to
hear
said
of
his
wife
the
fact
that
a
coarseminded
man
found
her
lacking
in
attraction
was
simply
another
proof
of
her
quality
yet
the
words
sent
a
faint
shiver
through
his
heart
what
if
niceness
carried
to
that
supreme
degree
were
only
a
negation
the
curtain
dropped
before
an
emptiness
as
he
looked
at
may
returning
flushed
and
calm
from
her
final
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
had
never
yet
lifted
that
curtain
she
took
the
congratulations
of
her
rivals
and
of
the
rest
of
the
company
with
the
simplicity
that
was
her
crowning
grace
no
one
could
ever
be
jealous
of
her
triumphs
because
she
managed
to
give
the
feeling
that
she
would
have
been
just
as
serene
if
she
had
missed
them
but
when
her
eyes
met
her
husband
her
face
glowed
with
the
pleasure
she
saw
in
his
welland
was
waiting
for
them
and
they
drove
off
among
the
dispersing
carriages
may
handling
the
reins
and
archer
sitting
at
her
side
the
afternoon
sunlight
still
lingered
upon
the
bright
lawns
and
shrubberies
and
up
and
down
bellevue
avenue
rolled
a
double
line
of
victorias
landaus
and
carrying
ladies
and
gentlemen
away
from
the
beaufort
or
homeward
from
their
daily
afternoon
turn
along
the
ocean
drive
shall
we
go
to
see
granny
may
suddenly
proposed
i
should
like
to
tell
her
myself
that
i
won
the
prize
there
lots
of
time
before
dinner
archer
acquiesced
and
she
turned
the
ponies
down
narragansett
avenue
crossed
spring
street
and
drove
out
toward
the
rocky
moorland
beyond
in
this
unfashionable
region
catherine
the
great
always
indifferent
to
precedent
and
thrifty
of
purse
had
built
herself
in
her
youth
a
and
on
a
bit
of
cheap
land
overlooking
the
bay
here
in
a
thicket
of
stunted
oaks
her
verandahs
spread
themselves
above
the
waters
a
winding
drive
led
up
between
iron
stags
and
blue
glass
balls
embedded
in
mounds
of
geraniums
to
a
front
door
of
walnut
under
a
striped
and
behind
it
ran
a
narrow
hall
with
a
black
and
yellow
parquet
floor
upon
which
opened
four
small
square
rooms
with
heavy
under
ceilings
on
which
an
italian
had
lavished
all
the
divinities
of
olympus
one
of
these
rooms
had
been
turned
into
a
bedroom
by
mingott
when
the
burden
of
flesh
descended
on
her
and
in
the
adjoining
one
she
spent
her
days
enthroned
in
a
large
armchair
between
the
open
door
and
window
and
perpetually
waving
a
fan
which
the
prodigious
projection
of
her
bosom
kept
so
far
from
the
rest
of
her
person
that
the
air
it
set
in
motion
stirred
only
the
fringe
of
the
on
the
since
she
had
been
the
means
of
hastening
his
marriage
old
catherine
had
shown
to
archer
the
cordiality
which
a
service
rendered
excites
toward
the
person
served
she
was
persuaded
that
irrepressible
passion
was
the
cause
of
his
impatience
and
being
an
ardent
admirer
of
impulsiveness
when
it
did
not
lead
to
the
spending
of
money
she
always
received
him
with
a
genial
twinkle
of
complicity
and
a
play
of
allusion
to
which
may
seemed
fortunately
impervious
she
examined
and
appraised
with
much
interest
the
arrow
which
had
been
pinned
on
may
bosom
at
the
conclusion
of
the
match
remarking
that
in
her
day
a
filigree
brooch
would
have
been
thought
enough
but
that
there
was
no
denying
that
beaufort
did
things
handsomely
quite
an
heirloom
in
fact
my
dear
the
old
lady
chuckled
you
must
leave
it
in
fee
to
your
eldest
girl
she
pinched
may
white
arm
and
watched
the
colour
flood
her
face
well
well
what
have
i
said
to
make
you
shake
out
the
red
flag
ai
there
going
to
be
any
daughters
only
boys
eh
good
gracious
look
at
her
blushing
again
all
over
her
blushes
what
ca
i
say
that
either
mercy
me
when
my
children
beg
me
to
have
all
those
gods
and
goddesses
painted
out
overhead
i
always
say
i
too
thankful
to
have
somebody
about
me
that
nothing
can
shock
archer
burst
into
a
laugh
and
may
echoed
it
crimson
to
the
eyes
well
now
tell
me
all
about
the
party
please
my
dears
for
i
shall
never
get
a
straight
word
about
it
out
of
that
silly
medora
the
ancestress
continued
and
as
may
exclaimed
cousin
medora
but
i
thought
she
was
going
back
to
portsmouth
she
answered
placidly
so
she
is
but
she
got
to
come
here
first
to
pick
up
ellen
ah
you
did
know
ellen
had
come
to
spend
the
day
with
me
such
her
not
coming
for
the
summer
but
i
gave
up
arguing
with
young
people
about
fifty
years
ago
ellen
ellen
she
cried
in
her
shrill
old
voice
trying
to
bend
forward
far
enough
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lawn
beyond
the
verandah
there
was
no
answer
and
mingott
rapped
impatiently
with
her
stick
on
the
shiny
floor
a
mulatto
in
a
bright
turban
replying
to
the
summons
informed
her
mistress
that
she
had
seen
miss
ellen
going
down
the
path
to
the
shore
and
mingott
turned
to
archer
run
down
and
fetch
her
like
a
good
grandson
this
pretty
lady
will
describe
the
party
to
me
she
said
and
archer
stood
up
as
if
in
a
dream
he
had
heard
the
countess
olenska
name
pronounced
often
enough
during
the
year
and
a
half
since
they
had
last
met
and
was
even
familiar
with
the
main
incidents
of
her
life
in
the
interval
he
knew
that
she
had
spent
the
previous
summer
at
newport
where
she
appeared
to
have
gone
a
great
deal
into
society
but
that
in
the
autumn
she
had
suddenly
the
perfect
house
which
beaufort
had
been
at
such
pains
to
find
for
her
and
decided
to
establish
herself
in
washington
there
during
the
winter
he
had
heard
of
her
as
one
always
heard
of
pretty
women
in
washington
as
shining
in
the
brilliant
diplomatic
society
that
was
supposed
to
make
up
for
the
social
of
the
administration
he
had
listened
to
these
accounts
and
to
various
contradictory
reports
on
her
appearance
her
conversation
her
point
of
view
and
her
choice
of
friends
with
the
detachment
with
which
one
listens
to
reminiscences
of
some
one
long
since
dead
not
till
medora
suddenly
spoke
her
name
at
the
archery
match
had
ellen
olenska
become
a
living
presence
to
him
again
the
marchioness
foolish
lisp
had
called
up
a
vision
of
the
little
and
the
sound
of
the
returning
down
the
deserted
street
he
thought
of
a
story
he
had
read
of
some
peasant
children
in
tuscany
lighting
a
bunch
of
straw
in
a
wayside
cavern
and
revealing
old
silent
images
in
their
painted
tomb
the
way
to
the
shore
descended
from
the
bank
on
which
the
house
was
perched
to
a
walk
above
the
water
planted
with
weeping
willows
through
their
veil
archer
caught
the
glint
of
the
lime
rock
with
its
turret
and
the
tiny
house
in
which
the
heroic
keeper
ida
lewis
was
living
her
last
venerable
years
beyond
it
lay
the
flat
reaches
and
ugly
government
chimneys
of
goat
island
the
bay
spreading
northward
in
a
shimmer
of
gold
to
prudence
island
with
its
low
growth
of
oaks
and
the
shores
of
conanicut
faint
in
the
sunset
haze
from
the
willow
walk
projected
a
slight
wooden
pier
ending
in
a
sort
of
and
in
the
pagoda
a
lady
stood
leaning
against
the
rail
her
back
to
the
shore
archer
stopped
at
the
sight
as
if
he
had
waked
from
sleep
that
vision
of
the
past
was
a
dream
and
the
reality
was
what
awaited
him
in
the
house
on
the
bank
overhead
was
welland
circling
around
and
around
the
oval
at
the
door
was
may
sitting
under
the
shameless
olympians
and
glowing
with
secret
hopes
was
the
welland
villa
at
the
far
end
of
bellevue
avenue
and
welland
already
dressed
for
dinner
and
pacing
the
floor
watch
in
hand
with
dyspeptic
impatience
for
it
was
one
of
the
houses
in
which
one
always
knew
exactly
what
is
happening
at
a
given
hour
what
am
i
a
archer
thought
the
figure
at
the
end
of
the
pier
had
not
moved
for
a
long
moment
the
young
man
stood
half
way
down
the
bank
gazing
at
the
bay
furrowed
with
the
coming
and
going
of
sailboats
and
the
trailing
black
hauled
by
noisy
tugs
the
lady
in
the
seemed
to
be
held
by
the
same
sight
beyond
the
grey
bastions
of
fort
adams
a
sunset
was
splintering
up
into
a
thousand
fires
and
the
radiance
caught
the
sail
of
a
catboat
as
it
beat
out
through
the
channel
between
the
lime
rock
and
the
shore
archer
as
he
watched
remembered
the
scene
in
the
shaughraun
and
montague
lifting
ada
dyas
ribbon
to
his
lips
without
her
knowing
that
he
was
in
the
room
she
does
know
she
has
guessed
should
i
know
if
she
came
up
behind
me
i
wonder
he
mused
and
suddenly
he
said
to
himself
if
she
does
turn
before
that
sail
crosses
the
lime
rock
light
i
go
back
the
boat
was
gliding
out
on
the
receding
tide
it
slid
before
the
lime
rock
blotted
out
ida
lewis
little
house
and
passed
across
the
turret
in
which
the
light
was
hung
archer
waited
till
a
wide
space
of
water
sparkled
between
the
last
reef
of
the
island
and
the
stern
of
the
boat
but
still
the
figure
in
the
did
not
move
he
turned
and
walked
up
the
hill
i
sorry
you
did
find
ellen
i
should
have
liked
to
see
her
again
may
said
as
they
drove
home
through
the
dusk
but
perhaps
she
would
have
cared
she
seems
so
changed
changed
echoed
her
husband
in
a
colourless
voice
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ponies
twitching
ears
so
indifferent
to
her
friends
i
mean
giving
up
new
york
and
her
house
and
spending
her
time
with
such
queer
people
fancy
how
hideously
uncomfortable
she
must
be
at
the
blenkers
she
says
she
does
it
to
keep
cousin
medora
out
of
mischief
to
prevent
her
marrying
dreadful
people
but
i
sometimes
think
we
always
bored
her
archer
made
no
answer
and
she
continued
with
a
tinge
of
hardness
that
he
had
never
before
noticed
in
her
frank
fresh
voice
after
all
i
wonder
if
she
would
be
happier
with
her
husband
he
burst
into
a
laugh
sancta
simplicitas
he
exclaimed
and
as
she
turned
a
puzzled
frown
on
him
he
added
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
you
say
a
cruel
thing
before
cruel
well
watching
the
contortions
of
the
damned
is
supposed
to
be
a
favourite
sport
of
the
angels
but
i
believe
even
they
do
think
people
happier
in
hell
it
a
pity
she
ever
married
abroad
then
said
may
in
the
placid
tone
with
which
her
mother
met
welland
vagaries
and
archer
felt
himself
gently
relegated
to
the
category
of
unreasonable
husbands
they
drove
down
bellevue
avenue
and
turned
in
between
the
chamfered
wooden
surmounted
by
lamps
which
marked
the
approach
to
the
welland
villa
lights
were
already
shining
through
its
windows
and
archer
as
the
carriage
stopped
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
exactly
as
he
had
pictured
him
pacing
the
watch
in
hand
and
wearing
the
pained
expression
that
he
had
long
since
found
to
be
much
more
efficacious
than
anger
the
young
man
as
he
followed
his
wife
into
the
hall
was
conscious
of
a
curious
reversal
of
mood
there
was
something
about
the
luxury
of
the
welland
house
and
the
density
of
the
welland
atmosphere
so
charged
with
minute
observances
and
exactions
that
always
stole
into
his
system
like
a
narcotic
the
heavy
carpets
the
watchful
servants
the
perpetually
reminding
tick
of
disciplined
clocks
the
perpetually
renewed
stack
of
cards
and
invitations
on
the
hall
table
the
whole
chain
of
tyrannical
trifles
binding
one
hour
to
the
next
and
each
member
of
the
household
to
all
the
others
made
any
less
systematised
and
affluent
existence
seem
unreal
and
precarious
but
now
it
was
the
welland
house
and
the
life
he
was
expected
to
lead
in
it
that
had
become
unreal
and
irrelevant
and
the
brief
scene
on
the
shore
when
he
had
stood
irresolute
halfway
down
the
bank
was
as
close
to
him
as
the
blood
in
his
veins
all
night
he
lay
awake
in
the
big
chintz
bedroom
at
may
side
watching
the
moonlight
slant
along
the
carpet
and
thinking
of
ellen
olenska
driving
home
across
the
gleaming
beaches
behind
trotters
xxii
a
party
for
the
blenkers
the
blenkers
welland
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looked
anxiously
and
incredulously
across
the
at
his
wife
who
adjusting
her
gold
read
aloud
in
the
tone
of
high
comedy
professor
and
emerson
sillerton
request
the
pleasure
of
and
welland
company
at
the
meeting
of
the
wednesday
afternoon
club
on
august
at
punctually
to
meet
and
the
misses
blenker
red
gables
catherine
street
good
gracious
welland
gasped
as
if
a
second
reading
had
been
necessary
to
bring
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
the
thing
home
to
him
poor
amy
sillerton
you
never
can
tell
what
her
husband
will
do
next
welland
sighed
i
suppose
he
just
discovered
the
blenkers
professor
emerson
sillerton
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
newport
society
and
a
thorn
that
could
not
be
plucked
out
for
it
grew
on
a
venerable
and
venerated
family
tree
he
was
as
people
said
a
man
who
had
had
every
advantage
his
father
was
sillerton
jackson
uncle
his
mother
a
pennilow
of
boston
on
each
side
there
was
wealth
and
position
and
mutual
suitability
nothing
as
welland
had
often
remarked
nothing
on
earth
obliged
emerson
sillerton
to
be
an
archaeologist
or
indeed
a
professor
of
any
sort
or
to
live
in
newport
in
winter
or
do
any
of
the
other
revolutionary
things
that
he
did
but
at
least
if
he
was
going
to
break
with
tradition
and
flout
society
in
the
face
he
need
not
have
married
poor
amy
dagonet
who
had
a
right
to
expect
something
different
and
money
enough
to
keep
her
own
carriage
no
one
in
the
mingott
set
could
understand
why
amy
sillerton
had
submitted
so
tamely
to
the
eccentricities
of
a
husband
who
filled
the
house
with
men
and
women
and
when
he
travelled
took
her
to
explore
tombs
in
yucatan
instead
of
going
to
paris
or
italy
but
there
they
were
set
in
their
ways
and
apparently
unaware
that
they
were
different
from
other
people
and
when
they
gave
one
of
their
dreary
annual
every
family
on
the
cliffs
because
of
the
connection
had
to
draw
lots
and
send
an
unwilling
representative
it
a
wonder
welland
remarked
that
they
did
choose
the
cup
race
day
do
you
remember
two
years
ago
their
giving
a
party
for
a
black
man
on
the
day
of
julia
mingott
the
dansant
luckily
this
time
there
nothing
else
going
on
that
i
know
of
for
of
course
some
of
us
will
have
to
go
welland
sighed
nervously
of
us
my
dear
more
than
one
three
is
such
a
very
awkward
hour
i
have
to
be
here
at
three
to
take
my
drops
it
really
no
use
trying
to
follow
bencomb
new
treatment
if
i
do
do
it
systematically
and
if
i
join
you
later
of
course
i
shall
miss
my
drive
at
the
thought
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
again
and
a
flush
of
anxiety
rose
to
his
cheek
there
no
reason
why
you
should
go
at
all
my
dear
his
wife
answered
with
a
cheerfulness
that
had
become
automatic
i
have
some
cards
to
leave
at
the
other
end
of
bellevue
avenue
and
i
drop
in
at
about
three
and
stay
long
enough
to
make
poor
amy
feel
that
she
has
been
slighted
she
glanced
hesitatingly
at
her
daughter
and
if
newland
afternoon
is
provided
for
perhaps
may
can
drive
you
out
with
the
ponies
and
try
their
new
russet
harness
it
was
a
principle
in
the
welland
family
that
people
days
and
hours
should
be
what
welland
called
provided
for
the
melancholy
possibility
of
having
to
kill
time
especially
for
those
who
did
not
care
for
whist
or
solitaire
was
a
vision
that
haunted
her
as
the
spectre
of
the
unemployed
haunts
the
philanthropist
another
of
her
principles
was
that
parents
should
never
at
least
visibly
interfere
with
the
plans
of
their
married
children
and
the
difficulty
of
adjusting
this
respect
for
may
independence
with
the
exigency
of
welland
claims
could
be
overcome
only
by
the
exercise
of
an
ingenuity
which
left
not
a
second
of
welland
own
time
unprovided
for
of
course
i
drive
with
papa
i
sure
newland
will
find
something
to
do
may
said
in
a
tone
that
gently
reminded
her
husband
of
his
lack
of
response
it
was
a
cause
of
constant
distress
to
welland
that
her
showed
so
little
foresight
in
planning
his
days
often
already
during
the
fortnight
that
he
had
passed
under
her
roof
when
she
enquired
how
he
meant
to
spend
his
afternoon
he
had
answered
paradoxically
oh
i
think
for
a
change
i
just
save
it
instead
of
spending
it
and
once
when
she
and
may
had
had
to
go
on
a
round
of
afternoon
calls
he
had
confessed
to
having
lain
all
the
afternoon
under
a
rock
on
the
beach
below
the
house
newland
never
seems
to
look
ahead
welland
once
ventured
to
complain
to
her
daughter
and
may
answered
serenely
no
but
you
see
it
does
matter
because
when
there
nothing
particular
to
do
he
reads
a
book
ah
yes
like
his
father
welland
agreed
as
if
allowing
for
an
inherited
oddity
and
after
that
the
question
of
newland
unemployment
was
tacitly
dropped
nevertheless
as
the
day
for
the
sillerton
reception
approached
may
began
to
show
a
natural
solicitude
for
his
welfare
and
to
suggest
a
tennis
match
at
the
chiverses
or
a
sail
on
julius
beaufort
cutter
as
a
means
of
atoning
for
her
temporary
desertion
i
shall
be
back
by
six
you
know
dear
papa
never
drives
later
than
that
and
she
was
not
reassured
till
archer
said
that
he
thought
of
hiring
a
and
driving
up
the
island
to
a
to
look
at
a
second
horse
for
her
brougham
they
had
been
looking
for
this
horse
for
some
time
and
the
suggestion
was
so
acceptable
that
may
glanced
at
her
mother
as
if
to
say
you
see
he
knows
how
to
plan
out
his
time
as
well
as
any
of
us
the
idea
of
the
and
the
brougham
horse
had
germinated
in
archer
mind
on
the
very
day
when
the
emerson
sillerton
invitation
had
first
been
mentioned
but
he
had
kept
it
to
himself
as
if
there
were
something
clandestine
in
the
plan
and
discovery
might
prevent
its
execution
he
had
however
taken
the
precaution
to
engage
in
advance
a
runabout
with
a
pair
of
old
trotters
that
could
still
do
their
eighteen
miles
on
level
roads
and
at
two
hastily
deserting
the
he
sprang
into
the
light
carriage
and
drove
off
the
day
was
perfect
a
breeze
from
the
north
drove
little
puffs
of
white
cloud
across
an
ultramarine
sky
with
a
bright
sea
running
under
it
bellevue
avenue
was
empty
at
that
hour
and
after
dropping
the
at
the
corner
of
mill
street
archer
turned
down
the
old
beach
road
and
drove
across
eastman
beach
he
had
the
feeling
of
unexplained
excitement
with
which
on
at
school
he
used
to
start
off
into
the
unknown
taking
his
pair
at
an
easy
gait
he
counted
on
reaching
the
which
was
not
far
beyond
paradise
rocks
before
three
so
that
after
looking
over
the
horse
and
trying
him
if
he
seemed
promising
he
would
still
have
four
golden
hours
to
dispose
of
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
sillerton
party
he
had
said
to
himself
that
the
marchioness
manson
would
certainly
come
to
newport
with
the
blenkers
and
that
madame
olenska
might
again
take
the
opportunity
of
spending
the
day
with
her
grandmother
at
any
rate
the
blenker
habitation
would
probably
be
deserted
and
he
would
be
able
without
indiscretion
to
satisfy
a
vague
curiosity
concerning
it
he
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
countess
olenska
again
but
ever
since
he
had
looked
at
her
from
the
path
above
the
bay
he
had
wanted
irrationally
and
indescribably
to
see
the
place
she
was
living
in
and
to
follow
the
movements
of
her
imagined
figure
as
he
had
watched
the
real
one
in
the
the
longing
was
with
him
day
and
night
an
incessant
undefinable
craving
like
the
sudden
whim
of
a
sick
man
for
food
or
drink
once
tasted
and
long
since
forgotten
he
could
not
see
beyond
the
craving
or
picture
what
it
might
lead
to
for
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
wish
to
speak
to
madame
olenska
or
to
hear
her
voice
he
simply
felt
that
if
he
could
carry
away
the
vision
of
the
spot
of
earth
she
walked
on
and
the
way
the
sky
and
sea
enclosed
it
the
rest
of
the
world
might
seem
less
empty
when
he
reached
the
a
glance
showed
him
that
the
horse
was
not
what
he
wanted
nevertheless
he
took
a
turn
behind
it
in
order
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
but
at
three
he
shook
out
the
reins
over
the
trotters
and
turned
into
the
leading
to
portsmouth
the
wind
had
dropped
and
a
faint
haze
on
the
horizon
showed
that
a
fog
was
waiting
to
steal
up
the
saconnet
on
the
turn
of
the
tide
but
all
about
him
fields
and
woods
were
steeped
in
golden
light
he
drove
past
in
orchards
past
and
groves
of
oak
past
villages
with
white
steeples
rising
sharply
into
the
fading
sky
and
at
last
after
stopping
to
ask
the
way
of
some
men
at
work
in
a
field
he
turned
down
a
lane
between
high
banks
of
goldenrod
and
brambles
at
the
end
of
the
lane
was
the
blue
glimmer
of
the
river
to
the
left
standing
in
front
of
a
clump
of
oaks
and
maples
he
saw
a
long
house
with
white
paint
peeling
from
its
clapboards
on
the
facing
the
gateway
stood
one
of
the
open
sheds
in
which
the
new
englander
shelters
his
farming
implements
and
visitors
hitch
their
teams
archer
jumping
down
led
his
pair
into
the
shed
and
after
tying
them
to
a
post
turned
toward
the
house
the
patch
of
lawn
before
it
had
relapsed
into
a
but
to
the
left
an
overgrown
full
of
dahlias
and
rusty
encircled
a
ghostly
of
that
had
once
been
white
surmounted
by
a
wooden
cupid
who
had
lost
his
bow
and
arrow
but
continued
to
take
ineffectual
aim
archer
leaned
for
a
while
against
the
gate
no
one
was
in
sight
and
not
a
sound
came
from
the
open
windows
of
the
house
a
grizzled
newfoundland
dozing
before
the
door
seemed
as
ineffectual
a
guardian
as
the
arrowless
cupid
it
was
strange
to
think
that
this
place
of
silence
and
decay
was
the
home
of
the
turbulent
blenkers
yet
archer
was
sure
that
he
was
not
mistaken
for
a
long
time
he
stood
there
content
to
take
in
the
scene
and
gradually
falling
under
its
drowsy
spell
but
at
length
he
roused
himself
to
the
sense
of
the
passing
time
should
he
look
his
fill
and
then
drive
away
he
stood
irresolute
wishing
suddenly
to
see
the
inside
of
the
house
so
that
he
might
picture
the
room
that
madame
olenska
sat
in
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
walking
up
to
the
door
and
ringing
the
bell
if
as
he
supposed
she
was
away
with
the
rest
of
the
party
he
could
easily
give
his
name
and
ask
permission
to
go
into
the
to
write
a
message
but
instead
he
crossed
the
lawn
and
turned
toward
the
as
he
entered
it
he
caught
sight
of
something
in
the
and
presently
made
it
out
to
be
a
pink
parasol
the
parasol
drew
him
like
a
magnet
he
was
sure
it
was
hers
he
went
into
the
and
sitting
down
on
the
rickety
seat
picked
up
the
silken
thing
and
looked
at
its
carved
handle
which
was
made
of
some
rare
wood
that
gave
out
an
aromatic
scent
archer
lifted
the
handle
to
his
lips
he
heard
a
rustle
of
skirts
against
the
box
and
sat
motionless
leaning
on
the
parasol
handle
with
clasped
hands
and
letting
the
rustle
come
nearer
without
lifting
his
eyes
he
had
always
known
that
this
must
happen
oh
mr
archer
exclaimed
a
loud
young
voice
and
looking
up
he
saw
before
him
the
youngest
and
largest
of
the
blenker
girls
blonde
and
blowsy
in
bedraggled
muslin
a
red
blotch
on
one
of
her
cheeks
seemed
to
show
that
it
had
recently
been
pressed
against
a
pillow
and
her
eyes
stared
at
him
hospitably
but
confusedly
gracious
where
did
you
drop
from
i
must
have
been
sound
asleep
in
the
hammock
everybody
else
has
gone
to
newport
did
you
ring
she
incoherently
enquired
archer
confusion
was
greater
than
hers
i
no
that
is
i
was
just
going
to
i
had
to
come
up
the
island
to
see
about
a
horse
and
i
drove
over
on
a
chance
of
finding
blenker
and
your
visitors
but
the
house
seemed
empty
so
i
sat
down
to
wait
miss
blenker
shaking
off
the
fumes
of
sleep
looked
at
him
with
increasing
interest
the
house
is
empty
mother
not
here
or
the
marchioness
or
anybody
but
me
her
glance
became
faintly
reproachful
did
you
know
that
professor
and
sillerton
are
giving
a
for
mother
and
all
of
us
this
afternoon
it
was
too
unlucky
that
i
could
go
but
i
had
a
sore
throat
and
mother
was
afraid
of
the
drive
home
this
evening
did
you
ever
know
anything
so
disappointing
of
course
she
added
gaily
i
should
have
minded
half
as
much
if
i
known
you
were
coming
symptoms
of
a
lumbering
coquetry
became
visible
in
her
and
archer
found
the
strength
to
break
in
but
madame
olenska
has
she
gone
to
newport
too
miss
blenker
looked
at
him
with
surprise
madame
olenska
did
you
know
she
been
called
away
called
away
oh
my
best
parasol
i
lent
it
to
that
goose
of
a
katie
because
it
matched
her
ribbons
and
the
careless
thing
must
have
dropped
it
here
we
blenkers
are
all
like
that
real
bohemians
recovering
the
sunshade
with
a
powerful
hand
she
unfurled
it
and
suspended
its
rosy
dome
above
her
head
yes
ellen
was
called
away
yesterday
she
lets
us
call
her
ellen
you
know
a
telegram
came
from
boston
she
said
she
might
be
gone
for
two
days
i
do
love
the
way
she
does
her
hair
you
miss
blenker
rambled
on
archer
continued
to
stare
through
her
as
though
she
had
been
transparent
all
he
saw
was
the
trumpery
parasol
that
arched
its
pinkness
above
her
giggling
head
after
a
moment
he
ventured
you
do
happen
to
know
why
madame
olenska
went
to
boston
i
hope
it
was
not
on
account
of
bad
news
miss
blenker
took
this
with
a
cheerful
incredulity
oh
i
believe
so
she
did
tell
us
what
was
in
the
telegram
i
think
she
did
want
the
marchioness
to
know
she
so
she
does
she
remind
you
of
when
she
reads
geraldine
courtship
did
you
never
hear
her
archer
was
dealing
hurriedly
with
crowding
thoughts
his
whole
future
seemed
suddenly
to
be
unrolled
before
him
and
passing
down
its
endless
emptiness
he
saw
the
dwindling
figure
of
a
man
to
whom
nothing
was
ever
to
happen
he
glanced
about
him
at
the
unpruned
garden
the
house
and
the
under
which
the
dusk
was
gathering
it
had
seemed
so
exactly
the
place
in
which
he
ought
to
have
found
madame
olenska
and
she
was
far
away
and
even
the
pink
sunshade
was
not
hers
he
frowned
and
hesitated
you
do
know
i
suppose
i
shall
be
in
boston
tomorrow
if
i
could
manage
to
see
her
he
felt
that
miss
blenker
was
losing
interest
in
him
though
her
smile
persisted
oh
of
course
how
lovely
of
you
she
staying
at
the
parker
house
it
must
be
horrible
there
in
this
weather
after
that
archer
was
but
intermittently
aware
of
the
remarks
they
exchanged
he
could
only
remember
stoutly
resisting
her
entreaty
that
he
should
await
the
returning
family
and
have
high
tea
with
them
before
he
drove
home
at
length
with
his
hostess
still
at
his
side
he
passed
out
of
range
of
the
wooden
cupid
unfastened
his
horses
and
drove
off
at
the
turn
of
the
lane
he
saw
miss
blenker
standing
at
the
gate
and
waving
the
pink
parasol
xxiii
the
next
morning
when
archer
got
out
of
the
fall
river
train
he
emerged
upon
a
steaming
midsummer
boston
the
streets
near
the
station
were
full
of
the
smell
of
beer
and
coffee
and
decaying
fruit
and
a
populace
moved
through
them
with
the
intimate
abandon
of
boarders
going
down
the
passage
to
the
bathroom
archer
found
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
somerset
club
for
breakfast
even
the
fashionable
quarters
had
the
air
of
untidy
domesticity
to
which
no
excess
of
heat
ever
degrades
the
european
cities
in
calico
lounged
on
the
of
the
wealthy
and
the
common
looked
like
a
on
the
morrow
of
a
masonic
picnic
if
archer
had
tried
to
imagine
ellen
olenska
in
improbable
scenes
he
could
not
have
called
up
any
into
which
it
was
more
difficult
to
fit
her
than
this
and
deserted
boston
he
breakfasted
with
appetite
and
method
beginning
with
a
slice
of
melon
and
studying
a
morning
paper
while
he
waited
for
his
toast
and
scrambled
eggs
a
new
sense
of
energy
and
activity
had
possessed
him
ever
since
he
had
announced
to
may
the
night
before
that
he
had
business
in
boston
and
should
take
the
fall
river
boat
that
night
and
go
on
to
new
york
the
following
evening
it
had
always
been
understood
that
he
would
return
to
town
early
in
the
week
and
when
he
got
back
from
his
expedition
to
portsmouth
a
letter
from
the
office
which
fate
had
conspicuously
placed
on
a
corner
of
the
hall
table
sufficed
to
justify
his
sudden
change
of
plan
he
was
even
ashamed
of
the
ease
with
which
the
whole
thing
had
been
done
it
reminded
him
for
an
uncomfortable
moment
of
lawrence
lefferts
masterly
contrivances
for
securing
his
freedom
but
this
did
not
long
trouble
him
for
he
was
not
in
an
analytic
mood
after
breakfast
he
smoked
a
cigarette
and
glanced
over
the
commercial
advertiser
while
he
was
thus
engaged
two
or
three
men
he
knew
came
in
and
the
usual
greetings
were
exchanged
it
was
the
same
world
after
all
though
he
had
such
a
queer
sense
of
having
slipped
through
the
meshes
of
time
and
space
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
finding
that
it
was
nine
got
up
and
went
into
the
there
he
wrote
a
few
lines
and
ordered
a
messenger
to
take
a
cab
to
the
parker
house
and
wait
for
the
answer
he
then
sat
down
behind
another
newspaper
and
tried
to
calculate
how
long
it
would
take
a
cab
to
get
to
the
parker
house
the
lady
was
out
sir
he
suddenly
heard
a
waiter
voice
at
his
elbow
and
he
stammered
out
as
if
it
were
a
word
in
a
strange
language
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
hall
it
must
be
a
mistake
she
could
not
be
out
at
that
hour
he
flushed
with
anger
at
his
own
stupidity
why
had
he
not
sent
the
note
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
found
his
hat
and
stick
and
went
forth
into
the
street
the
city
had
suddenly
become
as
strange
and
vast
and
empty
as
if
he
were
a
traveller
from
distant
lands
for
a
moment
he
stood
on
the
hesitating
then
he
decided
to
go
to
the
parker
house
what
if
the
messenger
had
been
misinformed
and
she
were
still
there
he
started
to
walk
across
the
common
and
on
the
first
bench
under
a
tree
he
saw
her
sitting
she
had
a
grey
silk
sunshade
over
her
head
how
could
he
ever
have
imagined
her
with
a
pink
one
as
he
approached
he
was
struck
by
her
listless
attitude
she
sat
there
as
if
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
he
saw
her
drooping
profile
and
the
knot
of
hair
fastened
low
in
the
neck
under
her
dark
hat
and
the
long
wrinkled
glove
on
the
hand
that
held
the
sunshade
he
came
a
step
or
two
nearer
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
oh
she
said
and
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
a
startled
look
on
her
face
but
in
another
moment
it
gave
way
to
a
slow
smile
of
wonder
and
contentment
oh
she
murmured
again
on
a
different
note
as
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
and
without
rising
she
made
a
place
for
him
on
the
bench
i
here
on
business
just
got
here
archer
explained
and
without
knowing
why
he
suddenly
began
to
feign
astonishment
at
seeing
her
but
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
wilderness
he
had
really
no
idea
what
he
was
saying
he
felt
as
if
he
were
shouting
at
her
across
endless
distances
and
she
might
vanish
again
before
he
could
overtake
her
i
oh
i
here
on
business
too
she
answered
turning
her
head
toward
him
so
that
they
were
face
to
face
the
words
hardly
reached
him
he
was
aware
only
of
her
voice
and
of
the
startling
fact
that
not
an
echo
of
it
had
remained
in
his
memory
he
had
not
even
remembered
that
it
was
with
a
faint
roughness
on
the
consonants
you
do
your
hair
differently
he
said
his
heart
beating
as
if
he
had
uttered
something
irrevocable
differently
no
it
only
that
i
do
it
as
best
i
can
when
without
nastasia
nastasia
but
is
she
with
you
no
i
alone
for
two
days
it
was
not
worth
while
to
bring
her
you
alone
at
the
parker
house
she
looked
at
him
with
a
flash
of
her
old
malice
does
it
strike
you
as
dangerous
no
not
dangerous
but
unconventional
i
see
i
suppose
it
is
she
considered
a
moment
i
had
thought
of
it
because
i
just
done
something
so
much
more
unconventional
the
faint
tinge
of
irony
lingered
in
her
eyes
i
just
refused
to
take
back
a
sum
of
money
that
belonged
to
me
archer
sprang
up
and
moved
a
step
or
two
away
she
had
furled
her
parasol
and
sat
absently
drawing
patterns
on
the
gravel
presently
he
came
back
and
stood
before
her
some
one
has
come
here
to
meet
you
yes
with
this
offer
she
nodded
and
you
refused
because
of
the
conditions
i
refused
she
said
after
a
moment
he
sat
down
by
her
again
what
were
the
conditions
oh
they
were
not
onerous
just
to
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
now
and
then
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
archer
heart
had
slammed
itself
shut
in
the
queer
way
it
had
and
he
sat
vainly
groping
for
a
word
he
wants
you
back
at
any
price
well
a
considerable
price
at
least
the
sum
is
considerable
for
me
he
paused
again
beating
about
the
question
he
felt
he
must
put
it
was
to
meet
him
here
that
you
came
she
stared
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
meet
him
my
husband
here
at
this
season
he
always
at
cowes
or
baden
he
sent
some
one
yes
with
a
letter
she
shook
her
head
no
just
a
message
he
never
writes
i
think
i
had
more
than
one
letter
from
him
the
allusion
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheek
and
it
reflected
itself
in
archer
vivid
blush
why
does
he
never
write
why
should
he
what
does
one
have
secretaries
for
the
young
man
blush
deepened
she
had
pronounced
the
word
as
if
it
had
no
more
significance
than
any
other
in
her
vocabulary
for
a
moment
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
ask
did
he
send
his
secretary
then
but
the
remembrance
of
count
olenski
only
letter
to
his
wife
was
too
present
to
him
he
paused
again
and
then
took
another
plunge
and
the
person
the
emissary
the
emissary
madame
olenska
rejoined
still
smiling
might
for
all
i
care
have
left
already
but
he
has
insisted
on
waiting
till
this
evening
in
case
on
the
chance
and
you
came
out
here
to
think
the
chance
over
i
came
out
to
get
a
breath
of
air
the
hotel
too
stifling
taking
the
afternoon
train
back
to
portsmouth
they
sat
silent
not
looking
at
each
other
but
straight
ahead
at
the
people
passing
along
the
path
finally
she
turned
her
eyes
again
to
his
face
and
said
you
not
changed
he
felt
like
answering
i
was
till
i
saw
you
again
but
instead
he
stood
up
abruptly
and
glanced
about
him
at
the
untidy
sweltering
park
this
is
horrible
why
should
we
go
out
a
little
on
the
bay
there
a
breeze
and
it
will
be
cooler
we
might
take
the
steamboat
down
to
point
arley
she
glanced
up
at
him
hesitatingly
and
he
went
on
on
a
monday
morning
there
wo
be
anybody
on
the
boat
my
train
does
leave
till
evening
i
going
back
to
new
york
why
we
he
insisted
looking
down
at
her
and
suddenly
he
broke
out
have
we
done
all
we
could
oh
she
murmured
again
she
stood
up
and
reopened
her
sunshade
glancing
about
her
as
if
to
take
counsel
of
the
scene
and
assure
herself
of
the
impossibility
of
remaining
in
it
then
her
eyes
returned
to
his
face
you
must
say
things
like
that
to
me
she
said
i
say
anything
you
like
or
nothing
i
wo
open
my
mouth
unless
you
tell
me
to
what
harm
can
it
do
to
anybody
all
i
want
is
to
listen
to
you
he
stammered
she
drew
out
a
little
watch
on
an
enamelled
chain
oh
do
calculate
he
broke
out
give
me
the
day
i
want
to
get
you
away
from
that
man
at
what
time
was
he
coming
her
colour
rose
again
at
eleven
then
you
must
come
at
once
you
need
be
afraid
if
i
do
come
nor
you
either
if
you
do
i
swear
i
only
want
to
hear
about
you
to
know
what
you
been
doing
it
a
hundred
years
since
we
met
it
may
be
another
hundred
before
we
meet
again
she
still
wavered
her
anxious
eyes
on
his
face
why
did
you
come
down
to
the
beach
to
fetch
me
the
day
i
was
at
granny
she
asked
because
you
did
look
round
because
you
did
know
i
was
there
i
swore
i
would
unless
you
looked
round
he
laughed
as
the
childishness
of
the
confession
struck
him
but
i
did
look
round
on
purpose
on
purpose
i
knew
you
were
there
when
you
drove
in
i
recognised
the
ponies
so
i
went
down
to
the
beach
to
get
away
from
me
as
far
as
you
could
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
to
get
away
from
you
as
far
as
i
could
he
laughed
out
again
this
time
in
boyish
satisfaction
well
you
see
it
no
use
i
may
as
well
tell
you
he
added
that
the
business
i
came
here
for
was
just
to
find
you
but
look
here
we
must
start
or
we
shall
miss
our
boat
our
boat
she
frowned
perplexedly
and
then
smiled
oh
but
i
must
go
back
to
the
hotel
first
i
must
leave
a
note
as
many
notes
as
you
please
you
can
write
here
he
drew
out
a
and
one
of
the
new
stylographic
pens
i
even
got
an
envelope
you
see
how
everything
predestined
there
steady
the
thing
on
your
knee
and
i
get
the
pen
going
in
a
second
they
have
to
be
humoured
wait
he
banged
the
hand
that
held
the
pen
against
the
back
of
the
bench
it
like
jerking
down
the
mercury
in
a
thermometer
just
a
trick
now
try
she
laughed
and
bending
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
he
had
laid
on
his
began
to
write
archer
walked
away
a
few
steps
staring
with
radiant
unseeing
eyes
at
the
passersby
who
in
their
turn
paused
to
stare
at
the
unwonted
sight
of
a
lady
writing
a
note
on
her
knee
on
a
bench
in
the
common
madame
olenska
slipped
the
sheet
into
the
envelope
wrote
a
name
on
it
and
put
it
into
her
pocket
then
she
too
stood
up
they
walked
back
toward
beacon
street
and
near
the
club
archer
caught
sight
of
the
herdic
which
had
carried
his
note
to
the
parker
house
and
whose
driver
was
reposing
from
this
effort
by
bathing
his
brow
at
the
corner
hydrant
i
told
you
everything
was
predestined
here
a
cab
for
us
you
see
they
laughed
astonished
at
the
miracle
of
picking
up
a
public
conveyance
at
that
hour
and
in
that
unlikely
spot
in
a
city
where
were
still
a
foreign
novelty
archer
looking
at
his
watch
saw
that
there
was
time
to
drive
to
the
parker
house
before
going
to
the
steamboat
landing
they
rattled
through
the
hot
streets
and
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
archer
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
shall
i
take
it
in
he
asked
but
madame
olenska
shaking
her
head
sprang
out
and
disappeared
through
the
glazed
doors
it
was
barely
ten
but
what
if
the
emissary
impatient
for
her
reply
and
not
knowing
how
else
to
employ
his
time
were
already
seated
among
the
travellers
with
cooling
drinks
at
their
elbows
of
whom
archer
had
caught
a
glimpse
as
she
went
in
he
waited
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
herdic
a
sicilian
youth
with
eyes
like
nastasia
offered
to
shine
his
boots
and
an
irish
matron
to
sell
him
peaches
and
every
few
moments
the
doors
opened
to
let
out
hot
men
with
straw
hats
tilted
far
back
who
glanced
at
him
as
they
went
by
he
marvelled
that
the
door
should
open
so
often
and
that
all
the
people
it
let
out
should
look
so
like
each
other
and
so
like
all
the
other
hot
men
who
at
that
hour
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
were
passing
continuously
in
and
out
of
the
swinging
doors
of
hotels
and
then
suddenly
came
a
face
that
he
could
not
relate
to
the
other
faces
he
caught
but
a
flash
of
it
for
his
pacings
had
carried
him
to
the
farthest
point
of
his
beat
and
it
was
in
turning
back
to
the
hotel
that
he
saw
in
a
group
of
typical
countenances
the
lank
and
weary
the
round
and
surprised
the
and
mild
this
other
face
that
was
so
many
more
things
at
once
and
things
so
different
it
was
that
of
a
young
man
pale
too
and
by
the
heat
or
worry
or
both
but
somehow
quicker
vivider
more
conscious
or
perhaps
seeming
so
because
he
was
so
different
archer
hung
a
moment
on
a
thin
thread
of
memory
but
it
snapped
and
floated
off
with
the
disappearing
face
apparently
that
of
some
foreign
business
man
looking
doubly
foreign
in
such
a
setting
he
vanished
in
the
stream
of
passersby
and
archer
resumed
his
patrol
he
did
not
care
to
be
seen
watch
in
hand
within
view
of
the
hotel
and
his
unaided
reckoning
of
the
lapse
of
time
led
him
to
conclude
that
if
madame
olenska
was
so
long
in
reappearing
it
could
only
be
because
she
had
met
the
emissary
and
been
waylaid
by
him
at
the
thought
apprehension
rose
to
anguish
if
she
does
come
soon
i
go
in
and
find
her
he
said
the
doors
swung
open
again
and
she
was
at
his
side
they
got
into
the
herdic
and
as
it
drove
off
he
took
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
she
had
been
absent
just
three
minutes
in
the
clatter
of
loose
windows
that
made
talk
impossible
they
bumped
over
the
disjointed
cobblestones
to
the
wharf
seated
side
by
side
on
a
bench
of
the
boat
they
found
that
they
had
hardly
anything
to
say
to
each
other
or
rather
that
what
they
had
to
say
communicated
itself
best
in
the
blessed
silence
of
their
release
and
their
isolation
as
the
began
to
turn
and
wharves
and
shipping
to
recede
through
the
veil
of
heat
it
seemed
to
archer
that
everything
in
the
old
familiar
world
of
habit
was
receding
also
he
longed
to
ask
madame
olenska
if
she
did
not
have
the
same
feeling
the
feeling
that
they
were
starting
on
some
long
voyage
from
which
they
might
never
return
but
he
was
afraid
to
say
it
or
anything
else
that
might
disturb
the
delicate
balance
of
her
trust
in
him
in
reality
he
had
no
wish
to
betray
that
trust
there
had
been
days
and
nights
when
the
memory
of
their
kiss
had
burned
and
burned
on
his
lips
the
day
before
even
on
the
drive
to
portsmouth
the
thought
of
her
had
run
through
him
like
fire
but
now
that
she
was
beside
him
and
they
were
drifting
forth
into
this
unknown
world
they
seemed
to
have
reached
the
kind
of
deeper
nearness
that
a
touch
may
sunder
as
the
boat
left
the
harbour
and
turned
seaward
a
breeze
stirred
about
them
and
the
bay
broke
up
into
long
oily
undulations
then
into
ripples
tipped
with
spray
the
fog
of
sultriness
still
hung
over
the
city
but
ahead
lay
a
fresh
world
of
ruffled
waters
and
distant
promontories
with
in
the
sun
madame
olenska
leaning
back
against
the
drank
in
the
coolness
between
parted
lips
she
had
wound
a
long
veil
about
her
hat
but
it
left
her
face
uncovered
and
archer
was
struck
by
the
tranquil
gaiety
of
her
expression
she
seemed
to
take
their
adventure
as
a
matter
of
course
and
to
be
neither
in
fear
of
unexpected
encounters
nor
what
was
worse
unduly
elated
by
their
possibility
in
the
bare
of
the
inn
which
he
had
hoped
they
would
have
to
themselves
they
found
a
strident
party
of
young
men
and
women
on
a
holiday
the
landlord
told
them
and
archer
heart
sank
at
the
idea
of
having
to
talk
through
their
noise
this
is
hopeless
i
ask
for
a
private
room
he
said
and
madame
olenska
without
offering
any
objection
waited
while
he
went
in
search
of
it
the
room
opened
on
a
long
wooden
verandah
with
the
sea
coming
in
at
the
windows
it
was
bare
and
cool
with
a
table
covered
with
a
coarse
checkered
cloth
and
adorned
by
a
bottle
of
pickles
and
a
blueberry
pie
under
a
cage
no
more
cabinet
particulier
ever
offered
its
shelter
to
a
clandestine
couple
archer
fancied
he
saw
the
sense
of
its
reassurance
in
the
faintly
amused
smile
with
which
madame
olenska
sat
down
opposite
to
him
a
woman
who
had
run
away
from
her
husband
and
reputedly
with
another
man
was
likely
to
have
mastered
the
art
of
taking
things
for
granted
but
something
in
the
quality
of
her
composure
took
the
edge
from
his
irony
by
being
so
quiet
so
unsurprised
and
so
simple
she
had
managed
to
brush
away
the
conventions
and
make
him
feel
that
to
seek
to
be
alone
was
the
natural
thing
for
two
old
friends
who
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
xxiv
they
lunched
slowly
and
meditatively
with
mute
intervals
between
rushes
of
talk
for
the
spell
once
broken
they
had
much
to
say
and
yet
moments
when
saying
became
the
mere
accompaniment
to
long
duologues
of
silence
archer
kept
the
talk
from
his
own
affairs
not
with
conscious
intention
but
because
he
did
not
want
to
miss
a
word
of
her
history
and
leaning
on
the
table
her
chin
resting
on
her
clasped
hands
she
talked
to
him
of
the
year
and
a
half
since
they
had
met
she
had
grown
tired
of
what
people
called
society
new
york
was
kind
it
was
almost
oppressively
hospitable
she
should
never
forget
the
way
in
which
it
had
welcomed
her
back
but
after
the
first
flush
of
novelty
she
had
found
herself
as
she
phrased
it
too
different
to
care
for
the
things
it
cared
about
and
so
she
had
decided
to
try
washington
where
one
was
supposed
to
meet
more
varieties
of
people
and
of
opinion
and
on
the
whole
she
should
probably
settle
down
in
washington
and
make
a
home
there
for
poor
medora
who
had
worn
out
the
patience
of
all
her
other
relations
just
at
the
time
when
she
most
needed
looking
after
and
protecting
from
matrimonial
perils
but
dr
carver
are
you
afraid
of
dr
carver
i
hear
he
been
staying
with
you
at
the
blenkers
she
smiled
oh
the
carver
danger
is
over
dr
carver
is
a
very
clever
man
he
wants
a
rich
wife
to
finance
his
plans
and
medora
is
simply
a
good
advertisement
as
a
convert
a
convert
to
what
to
all
sorts
of
new
and
crazy
social
schemes
but
do
you
know
they
interest
me
more
than
the
blind
conformity
to
tradition
somebody
else
tradition
that
i
see
among
our
own
friends
it
seems
stupid
to
have
discovered
america
only
to
make
it
into
a
copy
of
another
country
she
smiled
across
the
table
do
you
suppose
christopher
columbus
would
have
taken
all
that
trouble
just
to
go
to
the
opera
with
the
selfridge
merrys
archer
changed
colour
and
beaufort
do
you
say
these
things
to
beaufort
he
asked
abruptly
i
have
seen
him
for
a
long
time
but
i
used
to
and
he
understands
ah
it
what
i
always
told
you
you
do
like
us
and
you
like
beaufort
because
he
so
unlike
us
he
looked
about
the
bare
room
and
out
at
the
bare
beach
and
the
row
of
stark
white
village
houses
strung
along
the
shore
we
damnably
dull
we
no
character
no
colour
no
i
wonder
he
broke
out
why
you
do
go
back
her
eyes
darkened
and
he
expected
an
indignant
rejoinder
but
she
sat
silent
as
if
thinking
over
what
he
had
said
and
he
grew
frightened
lest
she
should
answer
that
she
wondered
too
at
length
she
said
i
believe
it
because
of
you
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
confession
more
dispassionately
or
in
a
tone
less
encouraging
to
the
vanity
of
the
person
addressed
archer
reddened
to
the
temples
but
dared
not
move
or
speak
it
was
as
if
her
words
had
been
some
rare
butterfly
that
the
least
motion
might
drive
off
on
startled
wings
but
that
might
gather
a
flock
about
it
if
it
were
left
undisturbed
at
least
she
continued
it
was
you
who
made
me
understand
that
under
the
dullness
there
are
things
so
fine
and
sensitive
and
delicate
that
even
those
i
most
cared
for
in
my
other
life
look
cheap
in
comparison
i
do
know
how
to
explain
myself
she
drew
together
her
troubled
brows
but
it
seems
as
if
i
never
before
understood
with
how
much
that
is
hard
and
shabby
and
base
the
most
exquisite
pleasures
may
be
paid
exquisite
pleasures
it
something
to
have
had
them
he
felt
like
retorting
but
the
appeal
in
her
eyes
kept
him
silent
i
want
she
went
on
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you
and
with
myself
for
a
long
time
i
hoped
this
chance
would
come
that
i
might
tell
you
how
you
helped
me
what
you
made
of
me
archer
sat
staring
beneath
frowning
brows
he
interrupted
her
with
a
laugh
and
what
do
you
make
out
that
you
made
of
me
she
paled
a
little
of
you
yes
for
i
of
your
making
much
more
than
you
ever
were
of
mine
the
man
who
married
one
woman
because
another
one
told
him
to
her
paleness
turned
to
a
fugitive
flush
i
thought
you
promised
you
were
not
to
say
such
things
today
ah
how
like
a
woman
none
of
you
will
ever
see
a
bad
business
through
she
lowered
her
voice
is
it
a
bad
business
for
may
he
stood
in
the
window
drumming
against
the
raised
sash
and
feeling
in
every
fibre
the
wistful
tenderness
with
which
she
had
spoken
her
cousin
name
for
that
the
thing
we
always
got
to
think
of
have
we
by
your
own
showing
she
insisted
my
own
showing
he
echoed
his
blank
eyes
still
on
the
sea
or
if
not
she
continued
pursuing
her
own
thought
with
a
painful
application
if
it
not
worth
while
to
have
given
up
to
have
missed
things
so
that
others
may
be
saved
from
disillusionment
and
misery
then
everything
i
came
home
for
everything
that
made
my
other
life
seem
by
contrast
so
bare
and
so
poor
because
no
one
there
took
account
of
them
all
these
things
are
a
sham
or
a
dream
he
turned
around
without
moving
from
his
place
and
in
that
case
there
no
reason
on
earth
why
you
should
go
back
he
concluded
for
her
her
eyes
were
clinging
to
him
desperately
oh
is
there
no
reason
not
if
you
staked
your
all
on
the
success
of
my
marriage
my
marriage
he
said
savagely
is
going
to
be
a
sight
to
keep
you
here
she
made
no
answer
and
he
went
on
what
the
use
you
gave
me
my
first
glimpse
of
a
real
life
and
at
the
same
moment
you
asked
me
to
go
on
with
a
sham
one
it
beyond
human
enduring
that
all
oh
do
say
that
when
i
enduring
it
she
burst
out
her
eyes
filling
her
arms
had
dropped
along
the
table
and
she
sat
with
her
face
abandoned
to
his
gaze
as
if
in
the
recklessness
of
a
desperate
peril
the
face
exposed
her
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
her
whole
person
with
the
soul
behind
it
archer
stood
dumb
overwhelmed
by
what
it
suddenly
told
him
you
too
oh
all
this
time
you
too
for
answer
she
let
the
tears
on
her
lids
overflow
and
run
slowly
downward
half
the
width
of
the
room
was
still
between
them
and
neither
made
any
show
of
moving
archer
was
conscious
of
a
curious
indifference
to
her
bodily
presence
he
would
hardly
have
been
aware
of
it
if
one
of
the
hands
she
had
flung
out
on
the
table
had
not
drawn
his
gaze
as
on
the
occasion
when
in
the
little
street
house
he
had
kept
his
eye
on
it
in
order
not
to
look
at
her
face
now
his
imagination
spun
about
the
hand
as
about
the
edge
of
a
vortex
but
still
he
made
no
effort
to
draw
nearer
he
had
known
the
love
that
is
fed
on
caresses
and
feeds
them
but
this
passion
that
was
closer
than
his
bones
was
not
to
be
superficially
satisfied
his
one
terror
was
to
do
anything
which
might
efface
the
sound
and
impression
of
her
words
his
one
thought
that
he
should
never
again
feel
quite
alone
but
after
a
moment
the
sense
of
waste
and
ruin
overcame
him
there
they
were
close
together
and
safe
and
shut
in
yet
so
chained
to
their
separate
destinies
that
they
might
as
well
have
been
half
the
world
apart
what
the
use
when
you
will
go
back
he
broke
out
a
great
hopeless
how
on
earth
can
i
keep
you
crying
out
to
her
beneath
his
words
she
sat
motionless
with
lowered
lids
oh
i
sha
go
yet
not
yet
some
time
then
some
time
that
you
already
foresee
at
that
she
raised
her
clearest
eyes
i
promise
you
not
as
long
as
you
hold
out
not
as
long
as
we
can
look
straight
at
each
other
like
this
he
dropped
into
his
chair
what
her
answer
really
said
was
if
you
lift
a
finger
you
drive
me
back
back
to
all
the
abominations
you
know
of
and
all
the
temptations
you
half
guess
he
understood
it
as
clearly
as
if
she
had
uttered
the
words
and
the
thought
kept
him
anchored
to
his
side
of
the
table
in
a
kind
of
moved
and
sacred
submission
what
a
life
for
you
he
groaned
oh
as
long
as
it
a
part
of
yours
and
mine
a
part
of
yours
she
nodded
and
that
to
be
all
for
either
of
us
well
it
is
all
is
it
at
that
he
sprang
up
forgetting
everything
but
the
sweetness
of
her
face
she
rose
too
not
as
if
to
meet
him
or
to
flee
from
him
but
quietly
as
though
the
worst
of
the
task
were
done
and
she
had
only
to
wait
so
quietly
that
as
he
came
close
her
outstretched
hands
acted
not
as
a
check
but
as
a
guide
to
him
they
fell
into
his
while
her
arms
extended
but
not
rigid
kept
him
far
enough
off
to
let
her
surrendered
face
say
the
rest
they
may
have
stood
in
that
way
for
a
long
time
or
only
for
a
few
moments
but
it
was
long
enough
for
her
silence
to
communicate
all
she
had
to
say
and
for
him
to
feel
that
only
one
thing
mattered
he
must
do
nothing
to
make
this
meeting
their
last
he
must
leave
their
future
in
her
care
asking
only
that
she
should
keep
fast
hold
of
it
do
do
be
unhappy
she
said
with
a
break
in
her
voice
as
she
drew
her
hands
away
and
he
answered
you
wo
go
back
you
wo
go
back
as
if
it
were
the
one
possibility
he
could
not
bear
i
wo
go
back
she
said
and
turning
away
she
opened
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
the
public
the
strident
were
gathering
up
their
possessions
preparatory
to
a
straggling
flight
to
the
wharf
across
the
beach
lay
the
white
at
the
pier
and
over
the
sunlit
waters
boston
loomed
in
a
line
of
haze
xxv
once
more
on
the
boat
and
in
the
presence
of
others
archer
felt
a
tranquillity
of
spirit
that
surprised
as
much
as
it
sustained
him
the
day
according
to
any
current
valuation
had
been
a
rather
ridiculous
failure
he
had
not
so
much
as
touched
madame
olenska
hand
with
his
lips
or
extracted
one
word
from
her
that
gave
promise
of
farther
opportunities
nevertheless
for
a
man
sick
with
unsatisfied
love
and
parting
for
an
indefinite
period
from
the
object
of
his
passion
he
felt
himself
almost
humiliatingly
calm
and
comforted
it
was
the
perfect
balance
she
had
held
between
their
loyalty
to
others
and
their
honesty
to
themselves
that
had
so
stirred
and
yet
tranquillized
him
a
balance
not
artfully
calculated
as
her
tears
and
her
falterings
showed
but
resulting
naturally
from
her
unabashed
sincerity
it
filled
him
with
a
tender
awe
now
the
danger
was
over
and
made
him
thank
the
fates
that
no
personal
vanity
no
sense
of
playing
a
part
before
sophisticated
witnesses
had
tempted
him
to
tempt
her
even
after
they
had
clasped
hands
for
at
the
fall
river
station
and
he
had
turned
away
alone
the
conviction
remained
with
him
of
having
saved
out
of
their
meeting
much
more
than
he
had
sacrificed
he
wandered
back
to
the
club
and
went
and
sat
alone
in
the
deserted
library
turning
and
turning
over
in
his
thoughts
every
separate
second
of
their
hours
together
it
was
clear
to
him
and
it
grew
more
clear
under
closer
scrutiny
that
if
she
should
finally
decide
on
returning
to
europe
returning
to
her
husband
it
would
not
be
because
her
old
life
tempted
her
even
on
the
new
terms
offered
no
she
would
go
only
if
she
felt
herself
becoming
a
temptation
to
archer
a
temptation
to
fall
away
from
the
standard
they
had
both
set
up
her
choice
would
be
to
stay
near
him
as
long
as
he
did
not
ask
her
to
come
nearer
and
it
depended
on
himself
to
keep
her
just
there
safe
but
secluded
in
the
train
these
thoughts
were
still
with
him
they
enclosed
him
in
a
kind
of
golden
haze
through
which
the
faces
about
him
looked
remote
and
indistinct
he
had
a
feeling
that
if
he
spoke
to
his
they
would
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
in
this
state
of
abstraction
he
found
himself
the
following
morning
waking
to
the
reality
of
a
stifling
september
day
in
new
york
the
faces
in
the
long
train
streamed
past
him
and
he
continued
to
stare
at
them
through
the
same
golden
blur
but
suddenly
as
he
left
the
station
one
of
the
faces
detached
itself
came
closer
and
forced
itself
upon
his
consciousness
it
was
as
he
instantly
recalled
the
face
of
the
young
man
he
had
seen
the
day
before
passing
out
of
the
parker
house
and
had
noted
as
not
conforming
to
type
as
not
having
an
american
hotel
face
the
same
thing
struck
him
now
and
again
he
became
aware
of
a
dim
stir
of
former
associations
the
young
man
stood
looking
about
him
with
the
dazed
air
of
the
foreigner
flung
upon
the
harsh
mercies
of
american
travel
then
he
advanced
toward
archer
lifted
his
hat
and
said
in
english
surely
monsieur
we
met
in
london
ah
to
be
sure
in
london
archer
grasped
his
hand
with
curiosity
and
sympathy
so
you
did
get
here
after
all
he
exclaimed
casting
a
wondering
eye
on
the
astute
and
haggard
little
countenance
of
young
carfry
french
tutor
oh
i
got
here
yes
riviere
smiled
with
drawn
lips
but
not
for
long
i
return
the
day
after
tomorrow
he
stood
grasping
his
light
valise
in
one
neatly
gloved
hand
and
gazing
anxiously
perplexedly
almost
appealingly
into
archer
face
i
wonder
monsieur
since
i
had
the
good
luck
to
run
across
you
if
i
might
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
it
come
to
luncheon
wo
you
down
town
i
mean
if
you
look
me
up
in
my
office
i
take
you
to
a
very
decent
restaurant
in
that
quarter
riviere
was
visibly
touched
and
surprised
you
too
kind
but
i
was
only
going
to
ask
if
you
would
tell
me
how
to
reach
some
sort
of
conveyance
there
are
no
porters
and
no
one
here
seems
to
listen
i
know
our
american
stations
must
surprise
you
when
you
ask
for
a
porter
they
give
you
but
if
you
come
along
extricate
you
and
you
must
really
lunch
with
me
you
know
the
young
man
after
a
just
perceptible
hesitation
replied
with
profuse
thanks
and
in
a
tone
that
did
not
carry
complete
conviction
that
he
was
already
engaged
but
when
they
had
reached
the
comparative
reassurance
of
the
street
he
asked
if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
archer
at
ease
in
the
midsummer
leisure
of
the
office
fixed
an
hour
and
scribbled
his
address
which
the
frenchman
pocketed
with
reiterated
thanks
and
a
wide
flourish
of
his
hat
a
received
him
and
archer
walked
away
punctually
at
the
hour
riviere
appeared
shaved
but
still
unmistakably
drawn
and
serious
archer
was
alone
in
his
office
and
the
young
man
before
accepting
the
seat
he
proffered
began
abruptly
i
believe
i
saw
you
sir
yesterday
in
boston
the
statement
was
insignificant
enough
and
archer
was
about
to
frame
an
assent
when
his
words
were
checked
by
something
mysterious
yet
illuminating
in
his
visitor
insistent
gaze
it
is
extraordinary
very
extraordinary
riviere
continued
that
we
should
have
met
in
the
circumstances
in
which
i
find
myself
what
circumstances
archer
asked
wondering
a
little
crudely
if
he
needed
money
riviere
continued
to
study
him
with
tentative
eyes
i
have
come
not
to
look
for
employment
as
i
spoke
of
doing
when
we
last
met
but
on
a
special
mission
ah
archer
exclaimed
in
a
flash
the
two
meetings
had
connected
themselves
in
his
mind
he
paused
to
take
in
the
situation
thus
suddenly
lighted
up
for
him
and
riviere
also
remained
silent
as
if
aware
that
what
he
had
said
was
enough
a
special
mission
archer
at
length
repeated
the
young
frenchman
opening
his
palms
raised
them
slightly
and
the
two
men
continued
to
look
at
each
other
across
the
till
archer
roused
himself
to
say
do
sit
down
whereupon
riviere
bowed
took
a
distant
chair
and
again
waited
it
was
about
this
mission
that
you
wanted
to
consult
me
archer
finally
asked
riviere
bent
his
head
not
in
my
own
behalf
on
that
score
i
i
have
fully
dealt
with
myself
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
speak
to
you
about
the
countess
olenska
archer
had
known
for
the
last
few
minutes
that
the
words
were
coming
but
when
they
came
they
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
his
temples
as
if
he
had
been
caught
by
a
branch
in
a
thicket
and
on
whose
behalf
he
said
do
you
wish
to
do
this
riviere
met
the
question
sturdily
well
i
might
say
hers
if
it
did
not
sound
like
a
liberty
shall
i
say
instead
on
behalf
of
abstract
justice
archer
considered
him
ironically
in
other
words
you
are
count
olenski
messenger
he
saw
his
blush
more
darkly
reflected
in
riviere
sallow
countenance
not
to
you
monsieur
if
i
come
to
you
it
is
on
quite
other
grounds
what
right
have
you
in
the
circumstances
to
be
on
any
other
ground
archer
retorted
if
you
an
emissary
you
an
emissary
the
young
man
considered
my
mission
is
over
as
far
as
the
countess
olenska
goes
it
has
failed
i
ca
help
that
archer
rejoined
on
the
same
note
of
irony
no
but
you
can
help
riviere
paused
turned
his
hat
about
in
his
still
carefully
gloved
hands
looked
into
its
lining
and
then
back
at
archer
face
you
can
help
monsieur
i
am
convinced
to
make
it
equally
a
failure
with
her
family
archer
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
well
and
by
god
i
will
he
exclaimed
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
down
wrathfully
at
the
little
frenchman
whose
face
though
he
too
had
risen
was
still
an
inch
or
two
below
the
line
of
archer
eyes
riviere
paled
to
his
normal
hue
paler
than
that
his
complexion
could
hardly
turn
why
the
devil
archer
explosively
continued
should
you
have
thought
since
i
suppose
you
appealing
to
me
on
the
ground
of
my
relationship
to
madame
olenska
that
i
should
take
a
view
contrary
to
the
rest
of
her
family
the
change
of
expression
in
riviere
face
was
for
a
time
his
only
answer
his
look
passed
from
timidity
to
absolute
distress
for
a
young
man
of
his
usually
resourceful
mien
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
appear
more
disarmed
and
defenceless
oh
monsieur
i
ca
imagine
archer
continued
why
you
should
have
come
to
me
when
there
are
others
so
much
nearer
to
the
countess
still
less
why
you
thought
i
should
be
more
accessible
to
the
arguments
i
suppose
you
were
sent
over
with
riviere
took
this
onslaught
with
a
disconcerting
humility
the
arguments
i
want
to
present
to
you
monsieur
are
my
own
and
not
those
i
was
sent
over
with
then
i
see
still
less
reason
for
listening
to
them
riviere
again
looked
into
his
hat
as
if
considering
whether
these
last
words
were
not
a
sufficiently
broad
hint
to
put
it
on
and
be
gone
then
he
spoke
with
sudden
decision
monsieur
will
you
tell
me
one
thing
is
it
my
right
to
be
here
that
you
question
or
do
you
perhaps
believe
the
whole
matter
to
be
already
closed
his
quiet
insistence
made
archer
feel
the
clumsiness
of
his
own
bluster
riviere
had
succeeded
in
imposing
himself
archer
reddening
slightly
dropped
into
his
chair
again
and
signed
to
the
young
man
to
be
seated
i
beg
your
pardon
but
why
is
the
matter
closed
riviere
gazed
back
at
him
with
anguish
you
do
then
agree
with
the
rest
of
the
family
that
in
face
of
the
new
proposals
i
have
brought
it
is
hardly
possible
for
madame
olenska
not
to
return
to
her
husband
good
god
archer
exclaimed
and
his
visitor
gave
out
a
low
murmur
of
confirmation
before
seeing
her
i
saw
at
count
olenski
request
lovell
mingott
with
whom
i
had
several
talks
before
going
to
boston
i
understand
that
he
represents
his
mother
view
and
that
manson
mingott
influence
is
great
throughout
her
family
archer
sat
silent
with
the
sense
of
clinging
to
the
edge
of
a
sliding
precipice
the
discovery
that
he
had
been
excluded
from
a
share
in
these
negotiations
and
even
from
the
knowledge
that
they
were
on
foot
caused
him
a
surprise
hardly
dulled
by
the
acuter
wonder
of
what
he
was
learning
he
saw
in
a
flash
that
if
the
family
had
ceased
to
consult
him
it
was
because
some
deep
tribal
instinct
warned
them
that
he
was
no
longer
on
their
side
and
he
recalled
with
a
start
of
comprehension
a
remark
of
may
during
their
drive
home
from
manson
mingott
on
the
day
of
the
archery
meeting
perhaps
after
all
ellen
would
be
happier
with
her
husband
even
in
the
tumult
of
new
discoveries
archer
remembered
his
indignant
exclamation
and
the
fact
that
since
then
his
wife
had
never
named
madame
olenska
to
him
her
careless
allusion
had
no
doubt
been
the
straw
held
up
to
see
which
way
the
wind
blew
the
result
had
been
reported
to
the
family
and
thereafter
archer
had
been
tacitly
omitted
from
their
counsels
he
admired
the
tribal
discipline
which
made
may
bow
to
this
decision
she
would
not
have
done
so
he
knew
had
her
conscience
protested
but
she
probably
shared
the
family
view
that
madame
olenska
would
be
better
off
as
an
unhappy
wife
than
as
a
separated
one
and
that
there
was
no
use
in
discussing
the
case
with
newland
who
had
an
awkward
way
of
suddenly
not
seeming
to
take
the
most
fundamental
things
for
granted
archer
looked
up
and
met
his
visitor
anxious
gaze
do
you
know
monsieur
is
it
possible
you
do
know
that
the
family
begin
to
doubt
if
they
have
the
right
to
advise
the
countess
to
refuse
her
last
proposals
the
proposals
you
brought
the
proposals
i
brought
it
was
on
archer
lips
to
exclaim
that
whatever
he
knew
or
did
not
know
was
no
concern
of
riviere
but
something
in
the
humble
and
yet
courageous
tenacity
of
riviere
gaze
made
him
reject
this
conclusion
and
he
met
the
young
man
question
with
another
what
is
your
object
in
speaking
to
me
of
this
he
had
not
to
wait
a
moment
for
the
answer
to
beg
you
monsieur
to
beg
you
with
all
the
force
i
capable
of
not
to
let
her
go
oh
do
let
her
riviere
exclaimed
archer
looked
at
him
with
increasing
astonishment
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
of
his
distress
or
the
strength
of
his
determination
he
had
evidently
resolved
to
let
everything
go
by
the
board
but
the
supreme
need
of
thus
putting
himself
on
record
archer
considered
may
i
ask
he
said
at
length
if
this
is
the
line
you
took
with
the
countess
olenska
riviere
reddened
but
his
eyes
did
not
falter
no
monsieur
i
accepted
my
mission
in
good
faith
i
really
believed
for
reasons
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
that
it
would
be
better
for
madame
olenska
to
recover
her
situation
her
fortune
the
social
consideration
that
her
husband
standing
gives
her
so
i
supposed
you
could
hardly
have
accepted
such
a
mission
otherwise
i
should
not
have
accepted
it
well
then
archer
paused
again
and
their
eyes
met
in
another
protracted
scrutiny
ah
monsieur
after
i
had
seen
her
after
i
had
listened
to
her
i
knew
she
was
better
off
here
you
knew
monsieur
i
discharged
my
mission
faithfully
i
put
the
arguments
i
stated
his
offers
without
adding
any
comment
of
my
own
the
countess
was
good
enough
to
listen
patiently
she
carried
her
goodness
so
far
as
to
see
me
twice
she
considered
impartially
all
i
had
come
to
say
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
two
talks
that
i
changed
my
mind
that
i
came
to
see
things
differently
may
i
ask
what
led
to
this
change
simply
seeing
the
change
in
her
riviere
replied
the
change
in
her
then
you
knew
her
before
the
young
man
colour
again
rose
i
used
to
see
her
in
her
house
i
have
known
count
olenski
for
many
years
you
can
imagine
that
he
would
not
have
sent
a
stranger
on
such
a
mission
archer
gaze
wandering
away
to
the
blank
walls
of
the
office
rested
on
a
hanging
calendar
surmounted
by
the
rugged
features
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
such
a
conversation
should
be
going
on
anywhere
within
the
millions
of
square
miles
subject
to
his
rule
seemed
as
strange
as
anything
that
the
imagination
could
invent
the
change
what
sort
of
a
change
ah
monsieur
if
i
could
tell
you
riviere
paused
tenez
the
discovery
i
suppose
of
what
i
never
thought
of
before
that
an
american
and
that
if
you
an
american
of
her
kind
of
your
kind
things
that
are
accepted
in
certain
other
societies
or
at
least
put
up
with
as
part
of
a
general
convenient
become
unthinkable
simply
unthinkable
if
madame
olenska
relations
understood
what
these
things
were
their
opposition
to
her
returning
would
no
doubt
be
as
unconditional
as
her
own
but
they
seem
to
regard
her
husband
wish
to
have
her
back
as
proof
of
an
irresistible
longing
for
domestic
life
riviere
paused
and
then
added
whereas
far
from
being
as
simple
as
that
archer
looked
back
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
then
down
at
his
desk
and
at
the
papers
scattered
on
it
for
a
second
or
two
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
during
this
interval
he
heard
riviere
chair
pushed
back
and
was
aware
that
the
young
man
had
risen
when
he
glanced
up
again
he
saw
that
his
visitor
was
as
moved
as
himself
thank
you
archer
said
simply
there
nothing
to
thank
me
for
monsieur
it
is
i
rather
riviere
broke
off
as
if
speech
for
him
too
were
difficult
i
should
like
though
he
continued
in
a
firmer
voice
to
add
one
thing
you
asked
me
if
i
was
in
count
olenski
employ
i
am
at
this
moment
i
returned
to
him
a
few
months
ago
for
reasons
of
private
necessity
such
as
may
happen
to
any
one
who
has
persons
ill
and
older
persons
dependent
on
him
but
from
the
moment
that
i
have
taken
the
step
of
coming
here
to
say
these
things
to
you
i
consider
myself
discharged
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
on
my
return
and
give
him
the
reasons
all
monsieur
riviere
bowed
and
drew
back
a
step
thank
you
archer
said
again
as
their
hands
met
xxvi
every
year
on
the
fifteenth
of
october
fifth
avenue
opened
its
shutters
unrolled
its
carpets
and
hung
up
its
triple
layer
of
by
the
first
of
november
this
household
ritual
was
over
and
society
had
begun
to
look
about
and
take
stock
of
itself
by
the
fifteenth
the
season
was
in
full
blast
opera
and
theatres
were
putting
forth
their
new
attractions
were
accumulating
and
dates
for
dances
being
fixed
and
punctually
at
about
this
time
archer
always
said
that
new
york
was
very
much
changed
observing
it
from
the
lofty
of
a
she
was
able
with
the
help
of
sillerton
jackson
and
miss
sophy
to
trace
each
new
crack
in
its
surface
and
all
the
strange
weeds
pushing
up
between
the
ordered
rows
of
social
vegetables
it
had
been
one
of
the
amusements
of
archer
youth
to
wait
for
this
annual
pronouncement
of
his
mother
and
to
hear
her
enumerate
the
minute
signs
of
disintegration
that
his
careless
gaze
had
overlooked
for
new
york
to
archer
mind
never
changed
without
changing
for
the
worse
and
in
this
view
miss
sophy
jackson
heartily
concurred
sillerton
jackson
as
became
a
man
of
the
world
suspended
his
judgment
and
listened
with
an
amused
impartiality
to
the
lamentations
of
the
ladies
but
even
he
never
denied
that
new
york
had
changed
and
newland
archer
in
the
winter
of
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
was
himself
obliged
to
admit
that
if
it
had
not
actually
changed
it
was
certainly
changing
these
points
had
been
raised
as
usual
at
archer
thanksgiving
dinner
at
the
date
when
she
was
officially
enjoined
to
give
thanks
for
the
blessings
of
the
year
it
was
her
habit
to
take
a
mournful
though
not
embittered
stock
of
her
world
and
wonder
what
there
was
to
be
thankful
for
at
any
rate
not
the
state
of
society
society
if
it
could
be
said
to
exist
was
rather
a
spectacle
on
which
to
call
down
biblical
imprecations
and
in
fact
every
one
knew
what
the
reverend
ashmore
meant
when
he
chose
a
text
from
jeremiah
chap
verse
for
his
thanksgiving
sermon
ashmore
the
new
rector
of
matthew
had
been
chosen
because
he
was
very
advanced
his
sermons
were
considered
bold
in
thought
and
novel
in
language
when
he
fulminated
against
fashionable
society
he
always
spoke
of
its
trend
and
to
archer
it
was
terrifying
and
yet
fascinating
to
feel
herself
part
of
a
community
that
was
trending
there
no
doubt
that
ashmore
is
right
there
is
a
marked
trend
she
said
as
if
it
were
something
visible
and
measurable
like
a
crack
in
a
house
it
was
odd
though
to
preach
about
it
on
thanksgiving
miss
jackson
opined
and
her
hostess
drily
rejoined
oh
he
means
us
to
give
thanks
for
what
left
archer
had
been
wont
to
smile
at
these
annual
vaticinations
of
his
mother
but
this
year
even
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
as
he
listened
to
an
enumeration
of
the
changes
that
the
trend
was
visible
the
extravagance
in
dress
miss
jackson
began
sillerton
took
me
to
the
first
night
of
the
opera
and
i
can
only
tell
you
that
jane
merry
dress
was
the
only
one
i
recognised
from
last
year
and
even
that
had
had
the
front
panel
changed
yet
i
know
she
got
it
out
from
worth
only
two
years
ago
because
my
seamstress
always
goes
in
to
make
over
her
paris
dresses
before
she
wears
them
ah
jane
merry
is
one
of
us
said
archer
sighing
as
if
it
were
not
such
an
enviable
thing
to
be
in
an
age
when
ladies
were
beginning
to
flaunt
abroad
their
paris
dresses
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
custom
house
instead
of
letting
them
mellow
under
lock
and
key
in
the
manner
of
archer
contemporaries
yes
she
one
of
the
few
in
my
youth
miss
jackson
rejoined
it
was
considered
vulgar
to
dress
in
the
newest
fashions
and
amy
sillerton
has
always
told
me
that
in
boston
the
rule
was
to
put
away
one
paris
dresses
for
two
years
old
baxter
pennilow
who
did
everything
handsomely
used
to
import
twelve
a
year
two
velvet
two
satin
two
silk
and
the
other
six
of
poplin
and
the
finest
cashmere
it
was
a
standing
order
and
as
she
was
ill
for
two
years
before
she
died
they
found
worth
dresses
that
had
never
been
taken
out
of
tissue
paper
and
when
the
girls
left
off
their
mourning
they
were
able
to
wear
the
first
lot
at
the
symphony
concerts
without
looking
in
advance
of
the
fashion
ah
well
boston
is
more
conservative
than
new
york
but
i
always
think
it
a
safe
rule
for
a
lady
to
lay
aside
her
french
dresses
for
one
season
archer
conceded
it
was
beaufort
who
started
the
new
fashion
by
making
his
wife
clap
her
new
clothes
on
her
back
as
soon
as
they
arrived
i
must
say
at
times
it
takes
all
regina
distinction
not
to
look
like
like
miss
jackson
glanced
around
the
table
caught
janey
bulging
gaze
and
took
refuge
in
an
unintelligible
murmur
like
her
rivals
said
sillerton
jackson
with
the
air
of
producing
an
epigram
oh
the
ladies
murmured
and
archer
added
partly
to
distract
her
daughter
attention
from
forbidden
topics
poor
regina
her
thanksgiving
has
been
a
very
cheerful
one
i
afraid
have
you
heard
the
rumours
about
beaufort
speculations
sillerton
jackson
nodded
carelessly
every
one
had
heard
the
rumours
in
question
and
he
scorned
to
confirm
a
tale
that
was
already
common
property
a
gloomy
silence
fell
upon
the
party
no
one
really
liked
beaufort
and
it
was
not
wholly
unpleasant
to
think
the
worst
of
his
private
life
but
the
idea
of
his
having
brought
financial
dishonour
on
his
wife
family
was
too
shocking
to
be
enjoyed
even
by
his
enemies
archer
new
york
tolerated
hypocrisy
in
private
relations
but
in
business
matters
it
exacted
a
limpid
and
impeccable
honesty
it
was
a
long
time
since
any
banker
had
failed
discreditably
but
every
one
remembered
the
social
extinction
visited
on
the
heads
of
the
firm
when
the
last
event
of
the
kind
had
happened
it
would
be
the
same
with
the
beauforts
in
spite
of
his
power
and
her
popularity
not
all
the
leagued
strength
of
the
dallas
connection
would
save
poor
regina
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
reports
of
her
husband
unlawful
speculations
the
talk
took
refuge
in
less
ominous
topics
but
everything
they
touched
on
seemed
to
confirm
archer
sense
of
an
accelerated
trend
of
course
newland
i
know
you
let
dear
may
go
to
sunday
evenings
she
began
and
may
interposed
gaily
oh
you
know
everybody
goes
to
struthers
now
and
she
was
invited
to
last
reception
it
was
thus
archer
reflected
that
new
york
managed
its
transitions
conspiring
to
ignore
them
till
they
were
well
over
and
then
in
all
good
faith
imagining
that
they
had
taken
place
in
a
preceding
age
there
was
always
a
traitor
in
the
citadel
and
after
he
or
generally
she
had
surrendered
the
keys
what
was
the
use
of
pretending
that
it
was
impregnable
once
people
had
tasted
of
struthers
easy
sunday
hospitality
they
were
not
likely
to
sit
at
home
remembering
that
her
champagne
was
transmuted
i
know
dear
i
know
archer
sighed
such
things
have
to
be
i
suppose
as
long
as
amusement
is
what
people
go
out
for
but
i
never
quite
forgiven
your
cousin
madame
olenska
for
being
the
first
person
to
countenance
mrs
struthers
a
sudden
blush
rose
to
young
archer
face
it
surprised
her
husband
as
much
as
the
other
guests
about
the
table
oh
ellen
she
murmured
much
in
the
same
accusing
and
yet
deprecating
tone
in
which
her
parents
might
have
said
oh
the
blenkers
it
was
the
note
which
the
family
had
taken
to
sounding
on
the
mention
of
the
countess
olenska
name
since
she
had
surprised
and
inconvenienced
them
by
remaining
obdurate
to
her
husband
advances
but
on
may
lips
it
gave
food
for
thought
and
archer
looked
at
her
with
the
sense
of
strangeness
that
sometimes
came
over
him
when
she
was
most
in
the
tone
of
her
environment
his
mother
with
less
than
her
usual
sensitiveness
to
atmosphere
still
insisted
i
always
thought
that
people
like
the
countess
olenska
who
have
lived
in
aristocratic
societies
ought
to
help
us
to
keep
up
our
social
distinctions
instead
of
ignoring
them
may
blush
remained
permanently
vivid
it
seemed
to
have
a
significance
beyond
that
implied
by
the
recognition
of
madame
social
bad
faith
i
no
doubt
we
all
seem
alike
to
foreigners
said
miss
jackson
tartly
i
do
think
ellen
cares
for
society
but
nobody
knows
exactly
what
she
does
care
for
may
continued
as
if
she
had
been
groping
for
something
noncommittal
ah
well
archer
sighed
again
everybody
knew
that
the
countess
olenska
was
no
longer
in
the
good
graces
of
her
family
even
her
devoted
champion
old
manson
mingott
had
been
unable
to
defend
her
refusal
to
return
to
her
husband
the
mingotts
had
not
proclaimed
their
disapproval
aloud
their
sense
of
solidarity
was
too
strong
they
had
simply
as
welland
said
let
poor
ellen
find
her
own
level
and
that
mortifyingly
and
incomprehensibly
was
in
the
dim
depths
where
the
blenkers
prevailed
and
people
who
wrote
celebrated
their
untidy
rites
it
was
incredible
but
it
was
a
fact
that
ellen
in
spite
of
all
her
opportunities
and
her
privileges
had
become
simply
bohemian
the
fact
enforced
the
contention
that
she
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
in
not
returning
to
count
olenski
after
all
a
young
woman
place
was
under
her
husband
roof
especially
when
she
had
left
it
in
circumstances
that
well
if
one
had
cared
to
look
into
them
madame
olenska
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
gentlemen
said
miss
sophy
with
her
air
of
wishing
to
put
forth
something
conciliatory
when
she
knew
that
she
was
planting
a
dart
ah
that
the
danger
that
a
young
woman
like
madame
olenska
is
always
exposed
to
archer
mournfully
agreed
and
the
ladies
on
this
conclusion
gathered
up
their
trains
to
seek
the
carcel
globes
of
the
while
archer
and
sillerton
jackson
withdrew
to
the
gothic
library
once
established
before
the
grate
and
consoling
himself
for
the
inadequacy
of
the
dinner
by
the
perfection
of
his
cigar
jackson
became
portentous
and
communicable
if
the
beaufort
smash
comes
he
announced
there
are
going
to
be
disclosures
archer
raised
his
head
quickly
he
could
never
hear
the
name
without
the
sharp
vision
of
beaufort
heavy
figure
opulently
furred
and
shod
advancing
through
the
snow
at
skuytercliff
there
bound
to
be
jackson
continued
the
nastiest
kind
of
a
cleaning
up
he
has
spent
all
his
money
on
regina
oh
well
that
discounted
is
it
my
belief
is
he
pull
out
yet
said
the
young
man
wanting
to
change
the
subject
perhaps
perhaps
i
know
he
was
to
see
some
of
the
influential
people
today
of
course
jackson
reluctantly
conceded
it
to
be
hoped
they
can
tide
him
over
this
time
anyhow
i
should
like
to
think
of
poor
regina
spending
the
rest
of
her
life
in
some
shabby
foreign
for
bankrupts
archer
said
nothing
it
seemed
to
him
so
natural
however
tragic
that
money
should
be
cruelly
expiated
that
his
mind
hardly
lingering
over
beaufort
doom
wandered
back
to
closer
questions
what
was
the
meaning
of
may
blush
when
the
countess
olenska
had
been
mentioned
four
months
had
passed
since
the
midsummer
day
that
he
and
madame
olenska
had
spent
together
and
since
then
he
had
not
seen
her
he
knew
that
she
had
returned
to
washington
to
the
little
house
which
she
and
medora
manson
had
taken
there
he
had
written
to
her
once
a
few
words
asking
when
they
were
to
meet
again
and
she
had
even
more
briefly
replied
not
yet
since
then
there
had
been
no
farther
communication
between
them
and
he
had
built
up
within
himself
a
kind
of
sanctuary
in
which
she
throned
among
his
secret
thoughts
and
longings
little
by
little
it
became
the
scene
of
his
real
life
of
his
only
rational
activities
thither
he
brought
the
books
he
read
the
ideas
and
feelings
which
nourished
him
his
judgments
and
his
visions
outside
it
in
the
scene
of
his
actual
life
he
moved
with
a
growing
sense
of
unreality
and
insufficiency
blundering
against
familiar
prejudices
and
traditional
points
of
view
as
an
man
goes
on
bumping
into
the
furniture
of
his
own
room
absent
that
was
what
he
was
so
absent
from
everything
most
densely
real
and
near
to
those
about
him
that
it
sometimes
startled
him
to
find
they
still
imagined
he
was
there
he
became
aware
that
jackson
was
clearing
his
throat
preparatory
to
farther
revelations
i
do
know
of
course
how
far
your
wife
family
are
aware
of
what
people
say
about
well
about
madame
olenska
refusal
to
accept
her
husband
latest
offer
archer
was
silent
and
jackson
obliquely
continued
it
a
pity
it
certainly
a
pity
that
she
refused
it
a
pity
in
god
name
why
jackson
looked
down
his
leg
to
the
unwrinkled
sock
that
joined
it
to
a
glossy
pump
well
to
put
it
on
the
lowest
ground
what
she
going
to
live
on
now
now
if
beaufort
archer
sprang
up
his
fist
banging
down
on
the
black
of
the
the
wells
of
the
brass
danced
in
their
sockets
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
sir
jackson
shifting
himself
slightly
in
his
chair
turned
a
tranquil
gaze
on
the
young
man
burning
face
well
i
have
it
on
pretty
good
authority
in
fact
on
old
herself
that
the
family
reduced
countess
olenska
allowance
considerably
when
she
definitely
refused
to
go
back
to
her
husband
and
as
by
this
refusal
she
also
forfeits
the
money
settled
on
her
when
she
married
which
olenski
was
ready
to
make
over
to
her
if
she
returned
why
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
my
dear
boy
by
asking
me
what
i
mean
jackson
retorted
archer
moved
toward
the
mantelpiece
and
bent
over
to
knock
his
ashes
into
the
grate
i
do
know
anything
of
madame
olenska
private
affairs
but
i
need
to
to
be
certain
that
what
you
insinuate
oh
i
do
it
lefferts
for
one
jackson
interposed
lefferts
who
made
love
to
her
and
got
snubbed
for
it
archer
broke
out
contemptuously
ah
did
he
snapped
the
other
as
if
this
were
exactly
the
fact
he
had
been
laying
a
trap
for
he
still
sat
sideways
from
the
fire
so
that
his
hard
old
gaze
held
archer
face
as
if
in
a
spring
of
steel
well
well
it
a
pity
she
did
go
back
before
beaufort
cropper
he
repeated
if
she
goes
now
and
if
he
fails
it
will
only
confirm
the
general
impression
which
is
by
any
means
peculiar
to
lefferts
by
the
way
oh
she
wo
go
back
now
less
than
ever
archer
had
no
sooner
said
it
than
he
had
once
more
the
feeling
that
it
was
exactly
what
jackson
had
been
waiting
for
the
old
gentleman
considered
him
attentively
that
your
opinion
eh
well
no
doubt
you
know
but
everybody
will
tell
you
that
the
few
pennies
medora
manson
has
left
are
all
in
beaufort
hands
and
how
the
two
women
are
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
unless
he
does
i
imagine
of
course
madame
olenska
may
still
soften
old
catherine
who
been
the
most
inexorably
opposed
to
her
staying
and
old
catherine
could
make
her
any
allowance
she
chooses
but
we
all
know
that
she
hates
parting
with
good
money
and
the
rest
of
the
family
have
no
particular
interest
in
keeping
madame
olenska
here
archer
was
burning
with
unavailing
wrath
he
was
exactly
in
the
state
when
a
man
is
sure
to
do
something
stupid
knowing
all
the
while
that
he
is
doing
it
he
saw
that
jackson
had
been
instantly
struck
by
the
fact
that
madame
olenska
differences
with
her
grandmother
and
her
other
relations
were
not
known
to
him
and
that
the
old
gentleman
had
drawn
his
own
conclusions
as
to
the
reasons
for
archer
exclusion
from
the
family
councils
this
fact
warned
archer
to
go
warily
but
the
insinuations
about
beaufort
made
him
reckless
he
was
mindful
however
if
not
of
his
own
danger
at
least
of
the
fact
that
jackson
was
under
his
mother
roof
and
consequently
his
guest
old
new
york
scrupulously
observed
the
etiquette
of
hospitality
and
no
discussion
with
a
guest
was
ever
allowed
to
degenerate
into
a
disagreement
shall
we
go
up
and
join
my
mother
he
suggested
curtly
as
jackson
last
cone
of
ashes
dropped
into
the
brass
ashtray
at
his
elbow
on
the
drive
homeward
may
remained
oddly
silent
through
the
darkness
he
still
felt
her
enveloped
in
her
menacing
blush
what
its
menace
meant
he
could
not
guess
but
he
was
sufficiently
warned
by
the
fact
that
madame
olenska
name
had
evoked
it
they
went
upstairs
and
he
turned
into
the
library
she
usually
followed
him
but
he
heard
her
passing
down
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
may
he
called
out
impatiently
and
she
came
back
with
a
slight
glance
of
surprise
at
his
tone
this
lamp
is
smoking
again
i
should
think
the
servants
might
see
that
it
kept
properly
trimmed
he
grumbled
nervously
i
so
sorry
it
sha
happen
again
she
answered
in
the
firm
bright
tone
she
had
learned
from
her
mother
and
it
exasperated
archer
to
feel
that
she
was
already
beginning
to
humour
him
like
a
younger
welland
she
bent
over
to
lower
the
wick
and
as
the
light
struck
up
on
her
white
shoulders
and
the
clear
curves
of
her
face
he
thought
how
young
she
is
for
what
endless
years
this
life
will
have
to
go
on
he
felt
with
a
kind
of
horror
his
own
strong
youth
and
the
bounding
blood
in
his
veins
look
here
he
said
suddenly
i
may
have
to
go
to
washington
for
a
few
days
soon
next
week
perhaps
her
hand
remained
on
the
key
of
the
lamp
as
she
turned
to
him
slowly
the
heat
from
its
flame
had
brought
back
a
glow
to
her
face
but
it
paled
as
she
looked
up
on
business
she
asked
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
there
could
be
no
other
conceivable
reason
and
that
she
had
put
the
question
automatically
as
if
merely
to
finish
his
own
sentence
on
business
naturally
there
a
patent
case
coming
up
before
the
supreme
court
he
gave
the
name
of
the
inventor
and
went
on
furnishing
details
with
all
lawrence
lefferts
practised
glibness
while
she
listened
attentively
saying
at
intervals
yes
i
see
the
change
will
do
you
good
she
said
simply
when
he
had
finished
and
you
must
be
sure
to
go
and
see
ellen
she
added
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
with
her
cloudless
smile
and
speaking
in
the
tone
she
might
have
employed
in
urging
him
not
to
neglect
some
irksome
family
duty
it
was
the
only
word
that
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
but
in
the
code
in
which
they
had
both
been
trained
it
meant
of
course
you
understand
that
i
know
all
that
people
have
been
saying
about
ellen
and
heartily
sympathise
with
my
family
in
their
effort
to
get
her
to
return
to
her
husband
i
also
know
that
for
some
reason
you
have
not
chosen
to
tell
me
you
have
advised
her
against
this
course
which
all
the
older
men
of
the
family
as
well
as
our
grandmother
agree
in
approving
and
that
it
is
owing
to
your
encouragement
that
ellen
defies
us
all
and
exposes
herself
to
the
kind
of
criticism
of
which
sillerton
jackson
probably
gave
you
this
evening
the
hint
that
has
made
you
so
irritable
hints
have
indeed
not
been
wanting
but
since
you
appear
unwilling
to
take
them
from
others
i
offer
you
this
one
myself
in
the
only
form
in
which
people
of
our
kind
can
communicate
unpleasant
things
to
each
other
by
letting
you
understand
that
i
know
you
mean
to
see
ellen
when
you
are
in
washington
and
are
perhaps
going
there
expressly
for
that
purpose
and
that
since
you
are
sure
to
see
her
i
wish
you
to
do
so
with
my
full
and
explicit
approval
and
to
take
the
opportunity
of
letting
her
know
what
the
course
of
conduct
you
have
encouraged
her
in
is
likely
to
lead
to
her
hand
was
still
on
the
key
of
the
lamp
when
the
last
word
of
this
mute
message
reached
him
she
turned
the
wick
down
lifted
off
the
globe
and
breathed
on
the
sulky
flame
they
smell
less
if
one
blows
them
out
she
explained
with
her
bright
housekeeping
air
on
the
threshold
she
turned
and
paused
for
his
kiss
xxvii
wall
street
the
next
day
had
more
reassuring
reports
of
situation
they
were
not
definite
but
they
were
hopeful
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
could
call
on
powerful
influences
in
case
of
emergency
and
that
he
had
done
so
with
success
and
that
evening
when
beaufort
appeared
at
the
opera
wearing
her
old
smile
and
a
new
emerald
necklace
society
drew
a
breath
of
relief
new
york
was
inexorable
in
its
condemnation
of
business
irregularities
so
far
there
had
been
no
exception
to
its
tacit
rule
that
those
who
broke
the
law
of
probity
must
pay
and
every
one
was
aware
that
even
beaufort
and
beaufort
wife
would
be
offered
up
unflinchingly
to
this
principle
but
to
be
obliged
to
offer
them
up
would
be
not
only
painful
but
inconvenient
the
disappearance
of
the
beauforts
would
leave
a
considerable
void
in
their
compact
little
circle
and
those
who
were
too
ignorant
or
too
careless
to
shudder
at
the
moral
catastrophe
bewailed
in
advance
the
loss
of
the
best
in
new
york
archer
had
definitely
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
washington
he
was
waiting
only
for
the
opening
of
the
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
may
so
that
its
date
might
coincide
with
that
of
his
visit
but
on
the
following
tuesday
he
learned
from
letterblair
that
the
case
might
be
postponed
for
several
weeks
nevertheless
he
went
home
that
afternoon
determined
in
any
event
to
leave
the
next
evening
the
chances
were
that
may
who
knew
nothing
of
his
professional
life
and
had
never
shown
any
interest
in
it
would
not
learn
of
the
postponement
should
it
take
place
nor
remember
the
names
of
the
litigants
if
they
were
mentioned
before
her
and
at
any
rate
he
could
no
longer
put
off
seeing
madame
olenska
there
were
too
many
things
that
he
must
say
to
her
on
the
wednesday
morning
when
he
reached
his
office
letterblair
met
him
with
a
troubled
face
beaufort
after
all
had
not
managed
to
tide
over
but
by
setting
afloat
the
rumour
that
he
had
done
so
he
had
reassured
his
depositors
and
heavy
payments
had
poured
into
the
bank
till
the
previous
evening
when
disturbing
reports
again
began
to
predominate
in
consequence
a
run
on
the
bank
had
begun
and
its
doors
were
likely
to
close
before
the
day
was
over
the
ugliest
things
were
being
said
of
beaufort
dastardly
manoeuvre
and
his
failure
promised
to
be
one
of
the
most
discreditable
in
the
history
of
wall
street
the
extent
of
the
calamity
left
letterblair
white
and
incapacitated
i
seen
bad
things
in
my
time
but
nothing
as
bad
as
this
everybody
we
know
will
be
hit
one
way
or
another
and
what
will
be
done
about
beaufort
what
can
be
done
about
her
i
pity
manson
mingott
as
much
as
anybody
coming
at
her
age
there
no
knowing
what
effect
this
affair
may
have
on
her
she
always
believed
in
beaufort
she
made
a
friend
of
him
and
there
the
whole
dallas
connection
poor
beaufort
is
related
to
every
one
of
you
her
only
chance
would
be
to
leave
her
husband
yet
how
can
any
one
tell
her
so
her
duty
is
at
his
side
and
luckily
she
seems
always
to
have
been
blind
to
his
private
weaknesses
there
was
a
knock
and
letterblair
turned
his
head
sharply
what
is
it
i
ca
be
disturbed
a
clerk
brought
in
a
letter
for
archer
and
withdrew
recognising
his
wife
hand
the
young
man
opened
the
envelope
and
read
wo
you
please
come
up
town
as
early
as
you
can
granny
had
a
slight
stroke
last
night
in
some
mysterious
way
she
found
out
before
any
one
else
this
awful
news
about
the
bank
uncle
lovell
is
away
shooting
and
the
idea
of
the
disgrace
has
made
poor
papa
so
nervous
that
he
has
a
temperature
and
ca
leave
his
room
mamma
needs
you
dreadfully
and
i
do
hope
you
can
get
away
at
once
and
go
straight
to
granny
archer
handed
the
note
to
his
senior
partner
and
a
few
minutes
later
was
crawling
northward
in
a
crowded
which
he
exchanged
at
fourteenth
street
for
one
of
the
high
staggering
omnibuses
of
the
fifth
avenue
line
it
was
after
twelve
when
this
laborious
vehicle
dropped
him
at
old
catherine
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
where
she
usually
throned
was
tenanted
by
the
inadequate
figure
of
her
daughter
welland
who
signed
a
haggard
welcome
as
she
caught
sight
of
archer
and
at
the
door
he
was
met
by
may
the
hall
wore
the
unnatural
appearance
peculiar
to
houses
suddenly
invaded
by
illness
wraps
and
furs
lay
in
heaps
on
the
chairs
a
doctor
bag
and
overcoat
were
on
the
table
and
beside
them
letters
and
cards
had
already
piled
up
unheeded
may
looked
pale
but
smiling
bencomb
who
had
just
come
for
the
second
time
took
a
more
hopeful
view
and
mingott
dauntless
determination
to
live
and
get
well
was
already
having
an
effect
on
her
family
may
led
archer
into
the
old
lady
where
the
sliding
doors
opening
into
the
bedroom
had
been
drawn
shut
and
the
heavy
yellow
damask
portieres
dropped
over
them
and
here
welland
communicated
to
him
in
horrified
undertones
the
details
of
the
catastrophe
it
appeared
that
the
evening
before
something
dreadful
and
mysterious
had
happened
at
about
eight
just
after
mingott
had
finished
the
game
of
solitaire
that
she
always
played
after
dinner
the
had
rung
and
a
lady
so
thickly
veiled
that
the
servants
did
not
immediately
recognise
her
had
asked
to
be
received
the
butler
hearing
a
familiar
voice
had
thrown
open
the
door
announcing
julius
beaufort
and
had
then
closed
it
again
on
the
two
ladies
they
must
have
been
together
he
thought
about
an
hour
when
mingott
bell
rang
beaufort
had
already
slipped
away
unseen
and
the
old
lady
white
and
vast
and
terrible
sat
alone
in
her
great
chair
and
signed
to
the
butler
to
help
her
into
her
room
she
seemed
at
that
time
though
obviously
distressed
in
complete
control
of
her
body
and
brain
the
mulatto
maid
put
her
to
bed
brought
her
a
cup
of
tea
as
usual
laid
everything
straight
in
the
room
and
went
away
but
at
three
in
the
morning
the
bell
rang
again
and
the
two
servants
hastening
in
at
this
unwonted
summons
for
old
catherine
usually
slept
like
a
baby
had
found
their
mistress
sitting
up
against
her
pillows
with
a
crooked
smile
on
her
face
and
one
little
hand
hanging
limp
from
its
huge
arm
the
stroke
had
clearly
been
a
slight
one
for
she
was
able
to
articulate
and
to
make
her
wishes
known
and
soon
after
the
first
visit
she
had
begun
to
regain
control
of
her
facial
muscles
but
the
alarm
had
been
great
and
proportionately
great
was
the
indignation
when
it
was
gathered
from
mingott
fragmentary
phrases
that
regina
beaufort
had
come
to
ask
her
incredible
effrontery
to
back
up
her
husband
see
them
through
not
to
desert
them
as
she
called
it
in
fact
to
induce
the
whole
family
to
cover
and
condone
their
monstrous
dishonour
i
said
to
her
always
been
honour
and
honesty
honesty
in
manson
mingott
house
and
will
be
till
i
carried
out
of
it
feet
first
the
old
woman
had
stammered
into
her
daughter
ear
in
the
thick
voice
of
the
partly
paralysed
and
when
she
said
my
name
auntie
my
name
regina
dallas
i
said
was
beaufort
when
he
covered
you
with
jewels
and
it
got
to
stay
beaufort
now
that
covered
you
with
shame
so
much
with
tears
and
gasps
of
horror
welland
imparted
blanched
and
demolished
by
the
unwonted
obligation
of
having
at
last
to
fix
her
eyes
on
the
unpleasant
and
the
discreditable
if
only
i
could
keep
it
from
your
he
always
says
for
sake
do
destroy
my
last
illusions
and
how
am
i
to
prevent
his
knowing
these
horrors
the
poor
lady
wailed
after
all
mamma
he
wo
have
seen
them
her
daughter
suggested
and
welland
sighed
ah
no
thank
heaven
he
safe
in
bed
and
bencomb
has
promised
to
keep
him
there
till
poor
mamma
is
better
and
regina
has
been
got
away
somewhere
archer
had
seated
himself
near
the
window
and
was
gazing
out
blankly
at
the
deserted
thoroughfare
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
summoned
rather
for
the
moral
support
of
the
stricken
ladies
than
because
of
any
specific
aid
that
he
could
render
lovell
mingott
had
been
telegraphed
for
and
messages
were
being
despatched
by
hand
to
the
members
of
the
family
living
in
new
york
and
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
discuss
in
hushed
tones
the
consequences
of
beaufort
dishonour
and
of
his
wife
unjustifiable
action
lovell
mingott
who
had
been
in
another
room
writing
notes
presently
reappeared
and
added
her
voice
to
the
discussion
in
their
day
the
elder
ladies
agreed
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
done
anything
disgraceful
in
business
had
only
one
idea
to
efface
herself
to
disappear
with
him
there
was
the
case
of
poor
grandmamma
spicer
your
may
of
course
welland
hastened
to
add
your
money
difficulties
were
private
losses
at
cards
or
signing
a
note
for
somebody
i
never
quite
knew
because
mamma
would
never
speak
of
it
but
she
was
brought
up
in
the
country
because
her
mother
had
to
leave
new
york
after
the
disgrace
whatever
it
was
they
lived
up
the
hudson
alone
winter
and
summer
till
mamma
was
sixteen
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
grandmamma
spicer
to
ask
the
family
to
her
as
i
understand
regina
calls
it
though
a
private
disgrace
is
nothing
compared
to
the
scandal
of
ruining
hundreds
of
innocent
people
yes
it
would
be
more
becoming
in
regina
to
hide
her
own
countenance
than
to
talk
about
other
people
lovell
mingott
agreed
i
understand
that
the
emerald
necklace
she
wore
at
the
opera
last
friday
had
been
sent
on
approval
from
ball
and
black
in
the
afternoon
i
wonder
if
they
ever
get
it
back
archer
listened
unmoved
to
the
relentless
chorus
the
idea
of
absolute
financial
probity
as
the
first
law
of
a
gentleman
code
was
too
deeply
ingrained
in
him
for
sentimental
considerations
to
weaken
it
an
adventurer
like
lemuel
struthers
might
build
up
the
millions
of
his
shoe
polish
on
any
number
of
shady
dealings
but
unblemished
honesty
was
the
noblesse
oblige
of
old
financial
new
york
nor
did
beaufort
fate
greatly
move
archer
he
felt
no
doubt
more
sorry
for
her
than
her
indignant
relatives
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
tie
between
husband
and
wife
even
if
breakable
in
prosperity
should
be
indissoluble
in
misfortune
as
letterblair
had
said
a
place
was
at
her
husband
side
when
he
was
in
trouble
but
place
was
not
at
his
side
and
beaufort
cool
assumption
that
it
was
seemed
almost
to
make
her
his
accomplice
the
mere
idea
of
a
woman
appealing
to
her
family
to
screen
her
husband
business
dishonour
was
inadmissible
since
it
was
the
one
thing
that
the
family
as
an
institution
could
not
do
the
mulatto
maid
called
lovell
mingott
into
the
hall
and
the
latter
came
back
in
a
moment
with
a
frowning
brow
she
wants
me
to
telegraph
for
ellen
olenska
i
had
written
to
ellen
of
course
and
to
medora
but
now
it
seems
that
not
enough
i
to
telegraph
to
her
immediately
and
to
tell
her
that
she
to
come
alone
the
announcement
was
received
in
silence
welland
sighed
resignedly
and
may
rose
from
her
seat
and
went
to
gather
up
some
newspapers
that
had
been
scattered
on
the
floor
i
suppose
it
must
be
done
lovell
mingott
continued
as
if
hoping
to
be
contradicted
and
may
turned
back
toward
the
middle
of
the
room
of
course
it
must
be
done
she
said
granny
knows
what
she
wants
and
we
must
carry
out
all
her
wishes
shall
i
write
the
telegram
for
you
auntie
if
it
goes
at
once
ellen
can
probably
catch
tomorrow
morning
train
she
pronounced
the
syllables
of
the
name
with
a
peculiar
clearness
as
if
she
had
tapped
on
two
silver
bells
well
it
ca
go
at
once
jasper
and
the
are
both
out
with
notes
and
telegrams
may
turned
to
her
husband
with
a
smile
but
here
newland
ready
to
do
anything
will
you
take
the
telegram
newland
there
be
just
time
before
luncheon
archer
rose
with
a
murmur
of
readiness
and
she
seated
herself
at
old
catherine
rosewood
bonheur
du
jour
and
wrote
out
the
message
in
her
large
immature
hand
when
it
was
written
she
blotted
it
neatly
and
handed
it
to
archer
what
a
pity
she
said
that
you
and
ellen
will
cross
each
other
on
the
way
newland
she
added
turning
to
her
mother
and
aunt
is
obliged
to
go
to
washington
about
a
patent
that
is
coming
up
before
the
supreme
court
i
suppose
uncle
lovell
will
be
back
by
tomorrow
night
and
with
granny
improving
so
much
it
does
seem
right
to
ask
newland
to
give
up
an
important
engagement
for
the
firm
does
it
she
paused
as
if
for
an
answer
and
welland
hastily
declared
oh
of
course
not
darling
your
granny
would
be
the
last
person
to
wish
it
as
archer
left
the
room
with
the
telegram
he
heard
his
add
presumably
to
lovell
mingott
but
why
on
earth
she
should
make
you
telegraph
for
ellen
olenska
and
clear
voice
rejoin
perhaps
it
to
urge
on
her
again
that
after
all
her
duty
is
with
her
husband
the
outer
door
closed
on
archer
and
he
walked
hastily
away
toward
the
telegraph
office
xxviii
howjer
spell
it
anyhow
asked
the
tart
young
lady
to
whom
archer
had
pushed
his
wife
telegram
across
the
brass
ledge
of
the
western
union
office
olenska
he
repeated
drawing
back
the
message
in
order
to
print
out
the
foreign
syllables
above
may
rambling
script
it
an
unlikely
name
for
a
new
york
telegraph
office
at
least
in
this
quarter
an
unexpected
voice
observed
and
turning
around
archer
saw
lawrence
lefferts
at
his
elbow
pulling
an
imperturbable
moustache
and
affecting
not
to
glance
at
the
message
hallo
newland
thought
i
catch
you
here
i
just
heard
of
old
mingott
stroke
and
as
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
house
i
saw
you
turning
down
this
street
and
nipped
after
you
i
suppose
you
come
from
there
archer
nodded
and
pushed
his
telegram
under
the
lattice
very
bad
eh
lefferts
continued
wiring
to
the
family
i
suppose
i
gather
it
is
bad
if
you
including
countess
olenska
archer
lips
stiffened
he
felt
a
savage
impulse
to
dash
his
fist
into
the
long
vain
handsome
face
at
his
side
why
he
questioned
lefferts
who
was
known
to
shrink
from
discussion
raised
his
with
an
ironic
grimace
that
warned
the
other
of
the
watching
damsel
behind
the
lattice
nothing
could
be
worse
form
the
look
reminded
archer
than
any
display
of
temper
in
a
public
place
archer
had
never
been
more
indifferent
to
the
requirements
of
form
but
his
impulse
to
do
lawrence
lefferts
a
physical
injury
was
only
momentary
the
idea
of
bandying
ellen
olenska
name
with
him
at
such
a
time
and
on
whatsoever
provocation
was
unthinkable
he
paid
for
his
telegram
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
together
into
the
street
there
archer
having
regained
his
went
on
mingott
is
much
better
the
doctor
feels
no
anxiety
whatever
and
lefferts
with
profuse
expressions
of
relief
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
that
there
were
beastly
bad
rumours
again
about
beaufort
that
afternoon
the
announcement
of
the
beaufort
failure
was
in
all
the
papers
it
overshadowed
the
report
of
manson
mingott
stroke
and
only
the
few
who
had
heard
of
the
mysterious
connection
between
the
two
events
thought
of
ascribing
old
catherine
illness
to
anything
but
the
accumulation
of
flesh
and
years
the
whole
of
new
york
was
darkened
by
the
tale
of
beaufort
dishonour
there
had
never
as
letterblair
said
been
a
worse
case
in
his
memory
nor
for
that
matter
in
the
memory
of
the
letterblair
who
had
given
his
name
to
the
firm
the
bank
had
continued
to
take
in
money
for
a
whole
day
after
its
failure
was
inevitable
and
as
many
of
its
clients
belonged
to
one
or
another
of
the
ruling
clans
duplicity
seemed
doubly
cynical
if
beaufort
had
not
taken
the
tone
that
such
misfortunes
the
word
was
her
own
were
the
test
of
friendship
compassion
for
her
might
have
tempered
the
general
indignation
against
her
husband
as
it
was
and
especially
after
the
object
of
her
nocturnal
visit
to
manson
mingott
had
become
known
her
cynicism
was
held
to
exceed
his
and
she
had
not
the
excuse
nor
her
detractors
the
satisfaction
of
pleading
that
she
was
a
foreigner
it
was
some
comfort
to
those
whose
securities
were
not
in
jeopardy
to
be
able
to
remind
themselves
that
beaufort
was
but
after
all
if
a
dallas
of
south
carolina
took
his
view
of
the
case
and
glibly
talked
of
his
soon
being
on
his
feet
again
the
argument
lost
its
edge
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
accept
this
awful
evidence
of
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
society
must
manage
to
get
on
without
the
beauforts
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
except
indeed
for
such
hapless
victims
of
the
disaster
as
medora
manson
the
poor
old
miss
lannings
and
certain
other
misguided
ladies
of
good
family
who
if
only
they
had
listened
to
henry
van
der
luyden
the
best
thing
the
beauforts
can
do
said
archer
summing
it
up
as
if
she
were
pronouncing
a
diagnosis
and
prescribing
a
course
of
treatment
is
to
go
and
live
at
regina
little
place
in
north
carolina
beaufort
has
always
kept
a
racing
stable
and
he
had
better
breed
trotting
horses
i
should
say
he
had
all
the
qualities
of
a
successful
horsedealer
every
one
agreed
with
her
but
no
one
condescended
to
enquire
what
the
beauforts
really
meant
to
do
the
next
day
manson
mingott
was
much
better
she
recovered
her
voice
sufficiently
to
give
orders
that
no
one
should
mention
the
beauforts
to
her
again
and
asked
when
bencomb
appeared
what
in
the
world
her
family
meant
by
making
such
a
fuss
about
her
health
if
people
of
my
age
will
eat
in
the
evening
what
are
they
to
expect
she
enquired
and
the
doctor
having
opportunely
modified
her
dietary
the
stroke
was
transformed
into
an
attack
of
indigestion
but
in
spite
of
her
firm
tone
old
catherine
did
not
wholly
recover
her
former
attitude
toward
life
the
growing
remoteness
of
old
age
though
it
had
not
diminished
her
curiosity
about
her
neighbours
had
blunted
her
never
very
lively
compassion
for
their
troubles
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
in
putting
the
beaufort
disaster
out
of
her
mind
but
for
the
first
time
she
became
absorbed
in
her
own
symptoms
and
began
to
take
a
sentimental
interest
in
certain
members
of
her
family
to
whom
she
had
hitherto
been
contemptuously
indifferent
welland
in
particular
had
the
privilege
of
attracting
her
notice
of
her
he
was
the
one
she
had
most
consistently
ignored
and
all
his
wife
efforts
to
represent
him
as
a
man
of
forceful
character
and
marked
intellectual
ability
if
he
had
only
chosen
had
been
met
with
a
derisive
chuckle
but
his
eminence
as
a
valetudinarian
now
made
him
an
object
of
engrossing
interest
and
mingott
issued
an
imperial
summons
to
him
to
come
and
compare
diets
as
soon
as
his
temperature
permitted
for
old
catherine
was
now
the
first
to
recognise
that
one
could
not
be
too
careful
about
temperatures
hours
after
madame
olenska
summons
a
telegram
announced
that
she
would
arrive
from
washington
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
at
the
wellands
where
the
newland
archers
chanced
to
be
lunching
the
question
as
to
who
should
meet
her
at
jersey
city
was
immediately
raised
and
the
material
difficulties
amid
which
the
welland
household
struggled
as
if
it
had
been
a
frontier
outpost
lent
animation
to
the
debate
it
was
agreed
that
welland
could
not
possibly
go
to
jersey
city
because
she
was
to
accompany
her
husband
to
old
catherine
that
afternoon
and
the
brougham
could
not
be
spared
since
if
welland
were
upset
by
seeing
his
for
the
first
time
after
her
attack
he
might
have
to
be
taken
home
at
a
moment
notice
the
welland
sons
would
of
course
be
down
town
lovell
mingott
would
be
just
hurrying
back
from
his
shooting
and
the
mingott
carriage
engaged
in
meeting
him
and
one
could
not
ask
may
at
the
close
of
a
winter
afternoon
to
go
alone
across
the
ferry
to
jersey
city
even
in
her
own
carriage
nevertheless
it
might
appear
inhospitable
and
contrary
to
old
catherine
express
wishes
if
madame
olenska
were
allowed
to
arrive
without
any
of
the
family
being
at
the
station
to
receive
her
it
was
just
like
ellen
welland
tired
voice
implied
to
place
the
family
in
such
a
dilemma
it
always
one
thing
after
another
the
poor
lady
grieved
in
one
of
her
rare
revolts
against
fate
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
think
mamma
must
be
less
well
than
bencomb
will
admit
is
this
morbid
desire
to
have
ellen
come
at
once
however
inconvenient
it
is
to
meet
her
the
words
had
been
thoughtless
as
the
utterances
of
impatience
often
are
and
welland
was
upon
them
with
a
pounce
augusta
he
said
turning
pale
and
laying
down
his
fork
have
you
any
other
reason
for
thinking
that
bencomb
is
less
to
be
relied
on
than
he
was
have
you
noticed
that
he
has
been
less
conscientious
than
usual
in
following
up
my
case
or
your
mother
it
was
welland
turn
to
grow
pale
as
the
endless
consequences
of
her
blunder
unrolled
themselves
before
her
but
she
managed
to
laugh
and
take
a
second
helping
of
scalloped
oysters
before
she
said
struggling
back
into
her
old
armour
of
cheerfulness
my
dear
how
could
you
imagine
such
a
thing
i
only
meant
that
after
the
decided
stand
mamma
took
about
its
being
ellen
duty
to
go
back
to
her
husband
it
seems
strange
that
she
should
be
seized
with
this
sudden
whim
to
see
her
when
there
are
half
a
dozen
other
grandchildren
that
she
might
have
asked
for
but
we
must
never
forget
that
mamma
in
spite
of
her
wonderful
vitality
is
a
very
old
woman
welland
brow
remained
clouded
and
it
was
evident
that
his
perturbed
imagination
had
fastened
at
once
on
this
last
remark
yes
your
mother
a
very
old
woman
and
for
all
we
know
bencomb
may
not
be
as
successful
with
very
old
people
as
you
say
my
dear
it
always
one
thing
after
another
and
in
another
ten
or
fifteen
years
i
suppose
i
shall
have
the
pleasing
duty
of
looking
about
for
a
new
doctor
always
better
to
make
such
a
change
before
it
absolutely
necessary
and
having
arrived
at
this
spartan
decision
welland
firmly
took
up
his
fork
but
all
the
while
welland
began
again
as
she
rose
from
the
and
led
the
way
into
the
wilderness
of
purple
satin
and
malachite
known
as
the
back
i
do
see
how
ellen
to
be
got
here
tomorrow
evening
and
i
do
like
to
have
things
settled
for
at
least
hours
ahead
archer
turned
from
the
fascinated
contemplation
of
a
small
painting
representing
two
cardinals
carousing
in
an
octagonal
ebony
frame
set
with
medallions
of
onyx
shall
i
fetch
her
he
proposed
i
can
easily
get
away
from
the
office
in
time
to
meet
the
brougham
at
the
ferry
if
may
will
send
it
there
his
heart
was
beating
excitedly
as
he
spoke
welland
heaved
a
sigh
of
gratitude
and
may
who
had
moved
away
to
the
window
turned
to
shed
on
him
a
beam
of
approval
so
you
see
mamma
everything
will
be
settled
hours
in
advance
she
said
stooping
over
to
kiss
her
mother
troubled
forehead
may
brougham
awaited
her
at
the
door
and
she
was
to
drive
archer
to
union
square
where
he
could
pick
up
a
broadway
car
to
carry
him
to
the
office
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
corner
she
said
i
did
want
to
worry
mamma
by
raising
fresh
obstacles
but
how
can
you
meet
ellen
tomorrow
and
bring
her
back
to
new
york
when
you
going
to
washington
oh
i
not
going
archer
answered
not
going
why
what
happened
her
voice
was
as
clear
as
a
bell
and
full
of
wifely
solicitude
the
case
is
off
postponed
postponed
how
odd
i
saw
a
note
this
morning
from
letterblair
to
mamma
saying
that
he
was
going
to
washington
tomorrow
for
the
big
patent
case
that
he
was
to
argue
before
the
supreme
court
you
said
it
was
a
patent
case
did
you
well
that
it
the
whole
office
ca
go
letterblair
decided
to
go
this
morning
then
it
not
postponed
she
continued
with
an
insistence
so
unlike
her
that
he
felt
the
blood
rising
to
his
face
as
if
he
were
blushing
for
her
unwonted
lapse
from
all
the
traditional
delicacies
no
but
my
going
is
he
answered
cursing
the
unnecessary
explanations
that
he
had
given
when
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
washington
and
wondering
where
he
had
read
that
clever
liars
give
details
but
that
the
cleverest
do
not
it
did
not
hurt
him
half
as
much
to
tell
may
an
untruth
as
to
see
her
trying
to
pretend
that
she
had
not
detected
him
i
not
going
till
later
on
luckily
for
the
convenience
of
your
family
he
continued
taking
base
refuge
in
sarcasm
as
he
spoke
he
felt
that
she
was
looking
at
him
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
hers
in
order
not
to
appear
to
be
avoiding
them
their
glances
met
for
a
second
and
perhaps
let
them
into
each
other
meanings
more
deeply
than
either
cared
to
go
yes
it
is
awfully
convenient
may
brightly
agreed
that
you
should
be
able
to
meet
ellen
after
all
you
saw
how
much
mamma
appreciated
your
offering
to
do
it
oh
i
delighted
to
do
it
the
carriage
stopped
and
as
he
jumped
out
she
leaned
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
dearest
she
said
her
eyes
so
blue
that
he
wondered
afterward
if
they
had
shone
on
him
through
tears
he
turned
away
and
hurried
across
union
square
repeating
to
himself
in
a
sort
of
inward
chant
it
all
of
two
hours
from
jersey
city
to
old
catherine
it
all
of
two
hours
and
it
may
be
more
xxix
his
wife
dark
blue
brougham
with
the
wedding
varnish
still
on
it
met
archer
at
the
ferry
and
conveyed
him
luxuriously
to
the
pennsylvania
terminus
in
jersey
city
it
was
a
sombre
snowy
afternoon
and
the
were
lit
in
the
big
reverberating
station
as
he
paced
the
platform
waiting
for
the
washington
express
he
remembered
that
there
were
people
who
thought
there
would
one
day
be
a
tunnel
under
the
hudson
through
which
the
trains
of
the
pennsylvania
railway
would
run
straight
into
new
york
they
were
of
the
brotherhood
of
visionaries
who
likewise
predicted
the
building
of
ships
that
would
cross
the
atlantic
in
five
days
the
invention
of
a
flying
machine
lighting
by
electricity
telephonic
communication
without
wires
and
other
arabian
night
marvels
i
do
care
which
of
their
visions
comes
true
archer
mused
as
long
as
the
tunnel
is
built
yet
in
his
senseless
happiness
he
pictured
madame
olenska
descent
from
the
train
his
discovery
of
her
a
long
way
off
among
the
throngs
of
meaningless
faces
her
clinging
to
his
arm
as
he
guided
her
to
the
carriage
their
slow
approach
to
the
wharf
among
slipping
horses
laden
carts
vociferating
teamsters
and
then
the
startling
quiet
of
the
where
they
would
sit
side
by
side
under
the
snow
in
the
motionless
carriage
while
the
earth
seemed
to
glide
away
under
them
rolling
to
the
other
side
of
the
sun
it
was
incredible
the
number
of
things
he
had
to
say
to
her
and
in
what
eloquent
order
they
were
forming
themselves
on
his
lips
the
clanging
and
groaning
of
the
train
came
nearer
and
it
staggered
slowly
into
the
station
like
a
monster
into
its
lair
archer
pushed
forward
elbowing
through
the
crowd
and
staring
blindly
into
window
after
window
of
the
carriages
and
then
suddenly
he
saw
madame
olenska
pale
and
surprised
face
close
at
hand
and
had
again
the
mortified
sensation
of
having
forgotten
what
she
looked
like
they
reached
each
other
their
hands
met
and
he
drew
her
arm
through
his
this
way
i
have
the
carriage
he
said
after
that
it
all
happened
as
he
had
dreamed
he
helped
her
into
the
brougham
with
her
bags
and
had
afterward
the
vague
recollection
of
having
properly
reassured
her
about
her
grandmother
and
given
her
a
summary
of
the
beaufort
situation
he
was
struck
by
the
softness
of
her
poor
regina
meanwhile
the
carriage
had
worked
its
way
out
of
the
coil
about
the
station
and
they
were
crawling
down
the
slippery
incline
to
the
wharf
menaced
by
swaying
bewildered
horses
dishevelled
and
an
empty
hearse
ah
that
hearse
she
shut
her
eyes
as
it
passed
and
clutched
at
archer
hand
if
only
it
does
mean
poor
granny
oh
no
no
she
much
better
she
all
right
really
there
passed
it
he
exclaimed
as
if
that
made
all
the
difference
her
hand
remained
in
his
and
as
the
carriage
lurched
across
the
onto
the
ferry
he
bent
over
unbuttoned
her
tight
brown
glove
and
kissed
her
palm
as
if
he
had
kissed
a
relic
she
disengaged
herself
with
a
faint
smile
and
he
said
you
did
expect
me
today
oh
no
i
meant
to
go
to
washington
to
see
you
i
made
all
my
arrangements
i
very
nearly
crossed
you
in
the
train
oh
she
exclaimed
as
if
terrified
by
the
narrowness
of
their
escape
do
you
know
i
hardly
remembered
you
hardly
remembered
me
i
mean
how
shall
i
explain
i
it
always
so
each
time
you
happen
to
me
all
over
again
oh
yes
i
know
i
know
does
it
do
i
too
to
you
he
insisted
she
nodded
looking
out
of
the
window
ellen
ellen
ellen
she
made
no
answer
and
he
sat
in
silence
watching
her
profile
grow
indistinct
against
the
dusk
beyond
the
window
what
had
she
been
doing
in
all
those
four
long
months
he
wondered
how
little
they
knew
of
each
other
after
all
the
precious
moments
were
slipping
away
but
he
had
forgotten
everything
that
he
had
meant
to
say
to
her
and
could
only
helplessly
brood
on
the
mystery
of
their
remoteness
and
their
proximity
which
seemed
to
be
symbolised
by
the
fact
of
their
sitting
so
close
to
each
other
and
yet
being
unable
to
see
each
other
faces
what
a
pretty
carriage
is
it
may
she
asked
suddenly
turning
her
face
from
the
window
yes
it
was
may
who
sent
you
to
fetch
me
then
how
kind
of
her
he
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
then
he
said
explosively
your
husband
secretary
came
to
see
me
the
day
after
we
met
in
boston
in
his
brief
letter
to
her
he
had
made
no
allusion
to
visit
and
his
intention
had
been
to
bury
the
incident
in
his
bosom
but
her
reminder
that
they
were
in
his
wife
carriage
provoked
him
to
an
impulse
of
retaliation
he
would
see
if
she
liked
his
reference
to
riviere
any
better
than
he
liked
hers
to
may
as
on
certain
other
occasions
when
he
had
expected
to
shake
her
out
of
her
usual
composure
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
surprise
and
at
once
he
concluded
he
writes
to
her
then
riviere
went
to
see
you
yes
did
you
know
no
she
answered
simply
and
you
not
surprised
she
hesitated
why
should
i
be
he
told
me
in
boston
that
he
knew
you
that
he
met
you
in
england
i
think
ellen
i
must
ask
you
one
thing
yes
i
wanted
to
ask
it
after
i
saw
him
but
i
could
put
it
in
a
letter
it
was
riviere
who
helped
you
to
get
away
when
you
left
your
husband
his
heart
was
beating
suffocatingly
would
she
meet
this
question
with
the
same
composure
yes
i
owe
him
a
great
debt
she
answered
without
the
least
tremor
in
her
quiet
voice
her
tone
was
so
natural
so
almost
indifferent
that
archer
turmoil
subsided
once
more
she
had
managed
by
her
sheer
simplicity
to
make
him
feel
stupidly
conventional
just
when
he
thought
he
was
flinging
convention
to
the
winds
i
think
you
the
most
honest
woman
i
ever
met
he
exclaimed
oh
no
but
probably
one
of
the
least
fussy
she
answered
a
smile
in
her
voice
call
it
what
you
like
you
look
at
things
as
they
are
ah
i
had
to
i
had
to
look
at
the
gorgon
well
it
has
blinded
you
you
seen
that
she
just
an
old
bogey
like
all
the
others
she
does
blind
one
but
she
dries
up
one
tears
the
answer
checked
the
pleading
on
archer
lips
it
seemed
to
come
from
depths
of
experience
beyond
his
reach
the
slow
advance
of
the
had
ceased
and
her
bows
bumped
against
the
piles
of
the
slip
with
a
violence
that
made
the
brougham
stagger
and
flung
archer
and
madame
olenska
against
each
other
the
young
man
trembling
felt
the
pressure
of
her
shoulder
and
passed
his
arm
about
her
if
you
not
blind
then
you
must
see
that
this
ca
last
what
ca
our
being
together
and
not
together
no
you
ought
not
to
have
come
today
she
said
in
an
altered
voice
and
suddenly
she
turned
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
at
the
same
moment
the
carriage
began
to
move
and
a
at
the
head
of
the
slip
flashed
its
light
into
the
window
she
drew
away
and
they
sat
silent
and
motionless
while
the
brougham
struggled
through
the
congestion
of
carriages
about
the
as
they
gained
the
street
archer
began
to
speak
hurriedly
do
be
afraid
of
me
you
need
squeeze
yourself
back
into
your
corner
like
that
a
stolen
kiss
is
what
i
want
look
i
not
even
trying
to
touch
the
sleeve
of
your
jacket
do
suppose
that
i
understand
your
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
let
this
feeling
between
us
dwindle
into
an
ordinary
i
could
have
spoken
like
this
yesterday
because
when
we
been
apart
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
every
thought
is
burnt
up
in
a
great
flame
but
then
you
come
and
you
so
much
more
than
i
remembered
and
what
i
want
of
you
is
so
much
more
than
an
hour
or
two
every
now
and
then
with
wastes
of
thirsty
waiting
between
that
i
can
sit
perfectly
still
beside
you
like
this
with
that
other
vision
in
my
mind
just
quietly
trusting
to
it
to
come
true
for
a
moment
she
made
no
reply
then
she
asked
hardly
above
a
whisper
what
do
you
mean
by
trusting
to
it
to
come
true
why
you
know
it
will
do
you
your
vision
of
you
and
me
together
she
burst
into
a
sudden
hard
laugh
you
choose
your
place
well
to
put
it
to
me
do
you
mean
because
we
in
my
wife
brougham
shall
we
get
out
and
walk
then
i
do
suppose
you
mind
a
little
snow
she
laughed
again
more
gently
no
i
sha
get
out
and
walk
because
my
business
is
to
get
to
granny
as
quickly
as
i
can
and
you
sit
beside
me
and
we
look
not
at
visions
but
at
realities
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
realities
the
only
reality
to
me
is
this
she
met
the
words
with
a
long
silence
during
which
the
carriage
rolled
down
an
obscure
and
then
turned
into
the
searching
illumination
of
fifth
avenue
is
it
your
idea
then
that
i
should
live
with
you
as
your
mistress
since
i
ca
be
your
wife
she
asked
the
crudeness
of
the
question
startled
him
the
word
was
one
that
women
of
his
class
fought
shy
of
even
when
their
talk
flitted
closest
about
the
topic
he
noticed
that
madame
olenska
pronounced
it
as
if
it
had
a
recognised
place
in
her
vocabulary
and
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
used
familiarly
in
her
presence
in
the
horrible
life
she
had
fled
from
her
question
pulled
him
up
with
a
jerk
and
he
floundered
i
want
i
want
somehow
to
get
away
with
you
into
a
world
where
words
like
that
categories
like
that
wo
exist
where
we
shall
be
simply
two
human
beings
who
love
each
other
who
are
the
whole
of
life
to
each
other
and
nothing
else
on
earth
will
matter
she
drew
a
deep
sigh
that
ended
in
another
laugh
oh
my
dear
where
is
that
country
have
you
ever
been
there
she
asked
and
as
he
remained
sullenly
dumb
she
went
on
i
know
so
many
who
tried
to
find
it
and
believe
me
they
all
got
out
by
mistake
at
wayside
stations
at
places
like
boulogne
or
pisa
or
monte
carlo
and
it
was
at
all
different
from
the
old
world
they
left
but
only
rather
smaller
and
dingier
and
more
promiscuous
he
had
never
heard
her
speak
in
such
a
tone
and
he
remembered
the
phrase
she
had
used
a
little
while
before
yes
the
gorgon
has
dried
your
tears
he
said
well
she
opened
my
eyes
too
it
a
delusion
to
say
that
she
blinds
people
what
she
does
is
just
the
contrary
she
fastens
their
eyelids
open
so
that
they
never
again
in
the
blessed
darkness
is
there
a
chinese
torture
like
that
there
ought
to
be
ah
believe
me
a
miserable
little
country
the
carriage
had
crossed
street
may
sturdy
was
carrying
them
northward
as
if
he
had
been
a
kentucky
trotter
archer
choked
with
the
sense
of
wasted
minutes
and
vain
words
then
what
exactly
is
your
plan
for
us
he
asked
for
us
but
there
no
us
in
that
sense
we
near
each
other
only
if
we
stay
far
from
each
other
then
we
can
be
ourselves
otherwise
we
only
newland
archer
the
husband
of
ellen
olenska
cousin
and
ellen
olenska
the
cousin
of
newland
archer
wife
trying
to
be
happy
behind
the
backs
of
the
people
who
trust
them
ah
i
beyond
that
he
groaned
no
you
not
you
never
been
beyond
and
i
have
she
said
in
a
strange
voice
and
i
know
what
it
looks
like
there
he
sat
silent
dazed
with
inarticulate
pain
then
he
groped
in
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
for
the
little
bell
that
signalled
orders
to
the
coachman
he
remembered
that
may
rang
twice
when
she
wished
to
stop
he
pressed
the
bell
and
the
carriage
drew
up
beside
the
curbstone
why
are
we
stopping
this
is
not
granny
madame
olenska
exclaimed
no
i
shall
get
out
here
he
stammered
opening
the
door
and
jumping
to
the
pavement
by
the
light
of
a
he
saw
her
startled
face
and
the
instinctive
motion
she
made
to
detain
him
he
closed
the
door
and
leaned
for
a
moment
in
the
window
you
right
i
ought
not
to
have
come
today
he
said
lowering
his
voice
so
that
the
coachman
should
not
hear
she
bent
forward
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
he
had
already
called
out
the
order
to
drive
on
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
while
he
stood
on
the
corner
the
snow
was
over
and
a
tingling
wind
had
sprung
up
that
lashed
his
face
as
he
stood
gazing
suddenly
he
felt
something
stiff
and
cold
on
his
lashes
and
perceived
that
he
had
been
crying
and
that
the
wind
had
frozen
his
tears
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
at
a
sharp
pace
down
fifth
avenue
to
his
own
house
xxx
that
evening
when
archer
came
down
before
dinner
he
found
the
empty
he
and
may
were
dining
alone
all
the
family
engagements
having
been
postponed
since
manson
mingott
illness
and
as
may
was
the
more
punctual
of
the
two
he
was
surprised
that
she
had
not
preceded
him
he
knew
that
she
was
at
home
for
while
he
dressed
he
had
heard
her
moving
about
in
her
room
and
he
wondered
what
had
delayed
her
he
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
dwelling
on
such
conjectures
as
a
means
of
tying
his
thoughts
fast
to
reality
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
had
found
the
clue
to
his
absorption
in
trifles
perhaps
even
welland
long
ago
had
had
escapes
and
visions
and
had
conjured
up
all
the
hosts
of
domesticity
to
defend
himself
against
them
when
may
appeared
he
thought
she
looked
tired
she
had
put
on
the
and
which
the
mingott
ceremonial
exacted
on
the
most
informal
occasions
and
had
built
her
fair
hair
into
its
usual
accumulated
coils
and
her
face
in
contrast
was
wan
and
almost
faded
but
she
shone
on
him
with
her
usual
tenderness
and
her
eyes
had
kept
the
blue
dazzle
of
the
day
before
what
became
of
you
dear
she
asked
i
was
waiting
at
granny
and
ellen
came
alone
and
said
she
had
dropped
you
on
the
way
because
you
had
to
rush
off
on
business
there
nothing
wrong
only
some
letters
i
forgotten
and
wanted
to
get
off
before
dinner
ah
she
said
and
a
moment
afterward
i
sorry
you
did
come
to
granny
unless
the
letters
were
urgent
they
were
he
rejoined
surprised
at
her
insistence
besides
i
do
see
why
i
should
have
gone
to
your
grandmother
i
did
know
you
were
there
she
turned
and
moved
to
the
above
the
as
she
stood
there
lifting
her
long
arm
to
fasten
a
puff
that
had
slipped
from
its
place
in
her
intricate
hair
archer
was
struck
by
something
languid
and
inelastic
in
her
attitude
and
wondered
if
the
deadly
monotony
of
their
lives
had
laid
its
weight
on
her
also
then
he
remembered
that
as
he
had
left
the
house
that
morning
she
had
called
over
the
stairs
that
she
would
meet
him
at
her
grandmother
so
that
they
might
drive
home
together
he
had
called
back
a
cheery
yes
and
then
absorbed
in
other
visions
had
forgotten
his
promise
now
he
was
smitten
with
compunction
yet
irritated
that
so
trifling
an
omission
should
be
stored
up
against
him
after
nearly
two
years
of
marriage
he
was
weary
of
living
in
a
perpetual
tepid
honeymoon
without
the
temperature
of
passion
yet
with
all
its
exactions
if
may
had
spoken
out
her
grievances
he
suspected
her
of
many
he
might
have
laughed
them
away
but
she
was
trained
to
conceal
imaginary
wounds
under
a
spartan
smile
to
disguise
his
own
annoyance
he
asked
how
her
grandmother
was
and
she
answered
that
mingott
was
still
improving
but
had
been
rather
disturbed
by
the
last
news
about
the
beauforts
what
news
it
seems
they
going
to
stay
in
new
york
i
believe
he
going
into
an
insurance
business
or
something
they
looking
about
for
a
small
house
the
preposterousness
of
the
case
was
beyond
discussion
and
they
went
in
to
dinner
during
dinner
their
talk
moved
in
its
usual
limited
circle
but
archer
noticed
that
his
wife
made
no
allusion
to
madame
olenska
nor
to
old
catherine
reception
of
her
he
was
thankful
for
the
fact
yet
felt
it
to
be
vaguely
ominous
they
went
up
to
the
library
for
coffee
and
archer
lit
a
cigar
and
took
down
a
volume
of
michelet
he
had
taken
to
history
in
the
evenings
since
may
had
shown
a
tendency
to
ask
him
to
read
aloud
whenever
she
saw
him
with
a
volume
of
poetry
not
that
he
disliked
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
but
because
he
could
always
foresee
her
comments
on
what
he
read
in
the
days
of
their
engagement
she
had
simply
as
he
now
perceived
echoed
what
he
told
her
but
since
he
had
ceased
to
provide
her
with
opinions
she
had
begun
to
hazard
her
own
with
results
destructive
to
his
enjoyment
of
the
works
commented
on
seeing
that
he
had
chosen
history
she
fetched
her
workbasket
drew
up
an
to
the
student
lamp
and
uncovered
a
cushion
she
was
embroidering
for
his
sofa
she
was
not
a
clever
her
large
capable
hands
were
made
for
riding
rowing
and
activities
but
since
other
wives
embroidered
cushions
for
their
husbands
she
did
not
wish
to
omit
this
last
link
in
her
devotion
she
was
so
placed
that
archer
by
merely
raising
his
eyes
could
see
her
bent
above
her
her
ruffled
slipping
back
from
her
firm
round
arms
the
betrothal
sapphire
shining
on
her
left
hand
above
her
broad
gold
and
the
right
hand
slowly
and
laboriously
stabbing
the
canvas
as
she
sat
thus
the
lamplight
full
on
her
clear
brow
he
said
to
himself
with
a
secret
dismay
that
he
would
always
know
the
thoughts
behind
it
that
never
in
all
the
years
to
come
would
she
surprise
him
by
an
unexpected
mood
by
a
new
idea
a
weakness
a
cruelty
or
an
emotion
she
had
spent
her
poetry
and
romance
on
their
short
courting
the
function
was
exhausted
because
the
need
was
past
now
she
was
simply
ripening
into
a
copy
of
her
mother
and
mysteriously
by
the
very
process
trying
to
turn
him
into
a
welland
he
laid
down
his
book
and
stood
up
impatiently
and
at
once
she
raised
her
head
what
the
matter
the
room
is
stifling
i
want
a
little
air
he
had
insisted
that
the
library
curtains
should
draw
backward
and
forward
on
a
rod
so
that
they
might
be
closed
in
the
evening
instead
of
remaining
nailed
to
a
gilt
cornice
and
immovably
looped
up
over
layers
of
lace
as
in
the
and
he
pulled
them
back
and
pushed
up
the
sash
leaning
out
into
the
icy
night
the
mere
fact
of
not
looking
at
may
seated
beside
his
table
under
his
lamp
the
fact
of
seeing
other
houses
roofs
chimneys
of
getting
the
sense
of
other
lives
outside
his
own
other
cities
beyond
new
york
and
a
whole
world
beyond
his
world
cleared
his
brain
and
made
it
easier
to
breathe
after
he
had
leaned
out
into
the
darkness
for
a
few
minutes
he
heard
her
say
newland
do
shut
the
window
you
catch
your
death
he
pulled
the
sash
down
and
turned
back
catch
my
death
he
echoed
and
he
felt
like
adding
but
i
caught
it
already
i
am
dead
been
dead
for
months
and
months
and
suddenly
the
play
of
the
word
flashed
up
a
wild
suggestion
what
if
it
were
she
who
was
dead
if
she
were
going
to
die
to
die
soon
and
leave
him
free
the
sensation
of
standing
there
in
that
warm
familiar
room
and
looking
at
her
and
wishing
her
dead
was
so
strange
so
fascinating
and
overmastering
that
its
enormity
did
not
immediately
strike
him
he
simply
felt
that
chance
had
given
him
a
new
possibility
to
which
his
sick
soul
might
cling
yes
may
might
die
people
did
young
people
healthy
people
like
herself
she
might
die
and
set
him
suddenly
free
she
glanced
up
and
he
saw
by
her
widening
eyes
that
there
must
be
something
strange
in
his
own
newland
are
you
ill
he
shook
his
head
and
turned
toward
his
she
bent
over
her
and
as
he
passed
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
hair
poor
may
he
said
poor
why
poor
she
echoed
with
a
strained
laugh
because
i
shall
never
be
able
to
open
a
window
without
worrying
you
he
rejoined
laughing
also
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
then
she
said
very
low
her
head
bowed
over
her
work
i
shall
never
worry
if
you
happy
ah
my
dear
and
i
shall
never
be
happy
unless
i
can
open
the
windows
in
this
weather
she
remonstrated
and
with
a
sigh
he
buried
his
head
in
his
book
six
or
seven
days
passed
archer
heard
nothing
from
madame
olenska
and
became
aware
that
her
name
would
not
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
by
any
member
of
the
family
he
did
not
try
to
see
her
to
do
so
while
she
was
at
old
catherine
guarded
bedside
would
have
been
almost
impossible
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
situation
he
let
himself
drift
conscious
somewhere
below
the
surface
of
his
thoughts
of
a
resolve
which
had
come
to
him
when
he
had
leaned
out
from
his
library
window
into
the
icy
night
the
strength
of
that
resolve
made
it
easy
to
wait
and
make
no
sign
then
one
day
may
told
him
that
manson
mingott
had
asked
to
see
him
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
the
request
for
the
old
lady
was
steadily
recovering
and
she
had
always
openly
declared
that
she
preferred
archer
to
any
of
her
other
may
gave
the
message
with
evident
pleasure
she
was
proud
of
old
appreciation
of
her
husband
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
then
archer
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
say
all
right
shall
we
go
together
this
afternoon
his
wife
face
brightened
but
she
instantly
answered
oh
you
much
better
go
alone
it
bores
granny
to
see
the
same
people
too
often
archer
heart
was
beating
violently
when
he
rang
old
bell
he
had
wanted
above
all
things
to
go
alone
for
he
felt
sure
the
visit
would
give
him
the
chance
of
saying
a
word
in
private
to
the
countess
olenska
he
had
determined
to
wait
till
the
chance
presented
itself
naturally
and
here
it
was
and
here
he
was
on
the
doorstep
behind
the
door
behind
the
curtains
of
the
yellow
damask
room
next
to
the
hall
she
was
surely
awaiting
him
in
another
moment
he
should
see
her
and
be
able
to
speak
to
her
before
she
led
him
to
the
he
wanted
only
to
put
one
question
after
that
his
course
would
be
clear
what
he
wished
to
ask
was
simply
the
date
of
her
return
to
washington
and
that
question
she
could
hardly
refuse
to
answer
but
in
the
yellow
it
was
the
mulatto
maid
who
waited
her
white
teeth
shining
like
a
keyboard
she
pushed
back
the
sliding
doors
and
ushered
him
into
old
catherine
presence
the
old
woman
sat
in
a
vast
near
her
bed
beside
her
was
a
mahogany
stand
bearing
a
cast
bronze
lamp
with
an
engraved
globe
over
which
a
green
paper
shade
had
been
balanced
there
was
not
a
book
or
a
newspaper
in
reach
nor
any
evidence
of
feminine
employment
conversation
had
always
been
mingott
sole
pursuit
and
she
would
have
scorned
to
feign
an
interest
in
fancywork
archer
saw
no
trace
of
the
slight
distortion
left
by
her
stroke
she
merely
looked
paler
with
darker
shadows
in
the
folds
and
recesses
of
her
obesity
and
in
the
fluted
tied
by
a
starched
bow
between
her
first
two
chins
and
the
muslin
kerchief
crossed
over
her
billowing
purple
she
seemed
like
some
shrewd
and
kindly
ancestress
of
her
own
who
might
have
yielded
too
freely
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
she
held
out
one
of
the
little
hands
that
nestled
in
a
hollow
of
her
huge
lap
like
pet
animals
and
called
to
the
maid
do
let
in
any
one
else
if
my
daughters
call
say
i
asleep
the
maid
disappeared
and
the
old
lady
turned
to
her
grandson
my
dear
am
i
perfectly
hideous
she
asked
gaily
launching
out
one
hand
in
search
of
the
folds
of
muslin
on
her
inaccessible
bosom
my
daughters
tell
me
it
does
matter
at
my
age
as
if
hideousness
matter
all
the
more
the
harder
it
gets
to
conceal
my
dear
you
handsomer
than
ever
archer
rejoined
in
the
same
tone
and
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
ah
but
not
as
handsome
as
ellen
she
jerked
out
twinkling
at
him
maliciously
and
before
he
could
answer
she
added
was
she
so
awfully
handsome
the
day
you
drove
her
up
from
the
ferry
he
laughed
and
she
continued
was
it
because
you
told
her
so
that
she
had
to
put
you
out
on
the
way
in
my
youth
young
men
did
desert
pretty
women
unless
they
were
made
to
she
gave
another
chuckle
and
interrupted
it
to
say
almost
querulously
it
a
pity
she
marry
you
i
always
told
her
so
it
would
have
spared
me
all
this
worry
but
who
ever
thought
of
sparing
their
grandmother
worry
archer
wondered
if
her
illness
had
blurred
her
faculties
but
suddenly
she
broke
out
well
it
settled
anyhow
she
going
to
stay
with
me
whatever
the
rest
of
the
family
say
she
had
been
here
five
minutes
before
i
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
to
keep
her
if
only
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
been
able
to
see
where
the
floor
was
archer
listened
in
silence
and
she
went
on
they
talked
me
over
as
no
doubt
you
know
persuaded
me
lovell
and
letterblair
and
augusta
welland
and
all
the
rest
of
them
that
i
must
hold
out
and
cut
off
her
allowance
till
she
was
made
to
see
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
back
to
olenski
they
thought
they
convinced
me
when
the
secretary
or
whatever
he
was
came
out
with
the
last
proposals
handsome
proposals
i
confess
they
were
after
all
marriage
is
marriage
and
money
money
both
useful
things
in
their
way
and
i
did
know
what
to
answer
she
broke
off
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
speaking
had
become
an
effort
but
the
minute
i
laid
eyes
on
her
i
said
sweet
bird
you
shut
you
up
in
that
cage
again
never
and
now
it
settled
that
she
to
stay
here
and
nurse
her
granny
as
long
as
there
a
granny
to
nurse
it
not
a
gay
prospect
but
she
mind
and
of
course
i
told
letterblair
that
she
to
be
given
her
proper
allowance
the
young
man
heard
her
with
veins
aglow
but
in
his
confusion
of
mind
he
hardly
knew
whether
her
news
brought
joy
or
pain
he
had
so
definitely
decided
on
the
course
he
meant
to
pursue
that
for
the
moment
he
could
not
readjust
his
thoughts
but
gradually
there
stole
over
him
the
delicious
sense
of
difficulties
deferred
and
opportunities
miraculously
provided
if
ellen
had
consented
to
come
and
live
with
her
grandmother
it
must
surely
be
because
she
had
recognised
the
impossibility
of
giving
him
up
this
was
her
answer
to
his
final
appeal
of
the
other
day
if
she
would
not
take
the
extreme
step
he
had
urged
she
had
at
last
yielded
to
he
sank
back
into
the
thought
with
the
involuntary
relief
of
a
man
who
has
been
ready
to
risk
everything
and
suddenly
tastes
the
dangerous
sweetness
of
security
she
could
have
gone
back
it
was
impossible
he
exclaimed
ah
my
dear
i
always
knew
you
were
on
her
side
and
that
why
i
sent
for
you
today
and
why
i
said
to
your
pretty
wife
when
she
proposed
to
come
with
you
my
dear
i
pining
to
see
newland
and
i
want
anybody
to
share
our
transports
for
you
see
my
dear
she
drew
her
head
back
as
far
as
its
tethering
chins
permitted
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
you
see
we
shall
have
a
fight
yet
the
family
do
want
her
here
and
they
say
it
because
i
been
ill
because
i
a
weak
old
woman
that
she
persuaded
me
i
not
well
enough
yet
to
fight
them
one
by
one
and
you
got
to
do
it
for
me
i
he
stammered
you
why
not
she
jerked
back
at
him
her
round
eyes
suddenly
as
sharp
as
her
hand
fluttered
from
its
and
lit
on
his
with
a
clutch
of
little
pale
nails
like
why
not
she
searchingly
repeated
archer
under
the
exposure
of
her
gaze
had
recovered
his
oh
i
do
count
i
too
insignificant
well
you
letterblair
partner
ai
you
you
got
to
get
at
them
through
letterblair
unless
you
got
a
reason
she
insisted
oh
my
dear
i
back
you
to
hold
your
own
against
them
all
without
my
help
but
you
shall
have
it
if
you
need
it
he
reassured
her
then
we
safe
she
sighed
and
smiling
on
him
with
all
her
ancient
cunning
she
added
as
she
settled
her
head
among
the
cushions
i
always
knew
you
back
us
up
because
they
never
quote
you
when
they
talk
about
its
being
her
duty
to
go
home
he
winced
a
little
at
her
terrifying
perspicacity
and
longed
to
ask
and
may
do
they
quote
her
but
he
judged
it
safer
to
turn
the
question
and
madame
olenska
when
am
i
to
see
her
he
said
the
old
lady
chuckled
crumpled
her
lids
and
went
through
the
pantomime
of
archness
not
today
one
at
a
time
please
madame
olenska
gone
out
he
flushed
with
disappointment
and
she
went
on
she
gone
out
my
child
gone
in
my
carriage
to
see
regina
beaufort
she
paused
for
this
announcement
to
produce
its
effect
that
what
she
reduced
me
to
already
the
day
after
she
got
here
she
put
on
her
best
bonnet
and
told
me
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
that
she
was
going
to
call
on
regina
beaufort
do
know
her
who
is
she
says
i
your
and
a
most
unhappy
woman
she
says
the
wife
of
a
scoundrel
i
answered
she
says
so
am
i
and
yet
all
my
family
want
me
to
go
back
to
him
well
that
floored
me
and
i
let
her
go
and
finally
one
day
she
said
it
was
raining
too
hard
to
go
out
on
foot
and
she
wanted
me
to
lend
her
my
carriage
for
i
asked
her
and
she
said
go
and
see
cousin
regina
cousin
now
my
dear
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
it
was
raining
a
drop
but
i
understood
her
and
i
let
her
have
the
carriage
after
all
regina
a
brave
woman
and
so
is
she
and
i
always
liked
courage
above
everything
archer
bent
down
and
pressed
his
lips
on
the
little
hand
that
still
lay
on
his
eh
eh
eh
whose
hand
did
you
think
you
were
kissing
young
man
your
wife
i
hope
the
old
lady
snapped
out
with
her
mocking
cackle
and
as
he
rose
to
go
she
called
out
after
him
give
her
her
granny
love
but
you
better
not
say
anything
about
our
talk
xxxi
archer
had
been
stunned
by
old
catherine
news
it
was
only
natural
that
madame
olenska
should
have
hastened
from
washington
in
response
to
her
grandmother
summons
but
that
she
should
have
decided
to
remain
under
her
roof
especially
now
that
mingott
had
almost
regained
her
health
was
less
easy
to
explain
archer
was
sure
that
madame
olenska
decision
had
not
been
influenced
by
the
change
in
her
financial
situation
he
knew
the
exact
figure
of
the
small
income
which
her
husband
had
allowed
her
at
their
separation
without
the
addition
of
her
grandmother
allowance
it
was
hardly
enough
to
live
on
in
any
sense
known
to
the
mingott
vocabulary
and
now
that
medora
manson
who
shared
her
life
had
been
ruined
such
a
pittance
would
barely
keep
the
two
women
clothed
and
fed
yet
archer
was
convinced
that
madame
olenska
had
not
accepted
her
offer
from
interested
motives
she
had
the
heedless
generosity
and
the
spasmodic
extravagance
of
persons
used
to
large
fortunes
and
indifferent
to
money
but
she
could
go
without
many
things
which
her
relations
considered
indispensable
and
lovell
mingott
and
welland
had
often
been
heard
to
deplore
that
any
one
who
had
enjoyed
the
cosmopolitan
luxuries
of
count
olenski
establishments
should
care
so
little
about
how
things
were
done
moreover
as
archer
knew
several
months
had
passed
since
her
allowance
had
been
cut
off
yet
in
the
interval
she
had
made
no
effort
to
regain
her
grandmother
favour
therefore
if
she
had
changed
her
course
it
must
be
for
a
different
reason
he
did
not
have
far
to
seek
for
that
reason
on
the
way
from
the
ferry
she
had
told
him
that
he
and
she
must
remain
apart
but
she
had
said
it
with
her
head
on
his
breast
he
knew
that
there
was
no
calculated
coquetry
in
her
words
she
was
fighting
her
fate
as
he
had
fought
his
and
clinging
desperately
to
her
resolve
that
they
should
not
break
faith
with
the
people
who
trusted
them
but
during
the
ten
days
which
had
elapsed
since
her
return
to
new
york
she
had
perhaps
guessed
from
his
silence
and
from
the
fact
of
his
making
no
attempt
to
see
her
that
he
was
meditating
a
decisive
step
a
step
from
which
there
was
no
turning
back
at
the
thought
a
sudden
fear
of
her
own
weakness
might
have
seized
her
and
she
might
have
felt
that
after
all
it
was
better
to
accept
the
compromise
usual
in
such
cases
and
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
an
hour
earlier
when
he
had
rung
mingott
bell
archer
had
fancied
that
his
path
was
clear
before
him
he
had
meant
to
have
a
word
alone
with
madame
olenska
and
failing
that
to
learn
from
her
grandmother
on
what
day
and
by
which
train
she
was
returning
to
washington
in
that
train
he
intended
to
join
her
and
travel
with
her
to
washington
or
as
much
farther
as
she
was
willing
to
go
his
own
fancy
inclined
to
japan
at
any
rate
she
would
understand
at
once
that
wherever
she
went
he
was
going
he
meant
to
leave
a
note
for
may
that
should
cut
off
any
other
alternative
he
had
fancied
himself
not
only
nerved
for
this
plunge
but
eager
to
take
it
yet
his
first
feeling
on
hearing
that
the
course
of
events
was
changed
had
been
one
of
relief
now
however
as
he
walked
home
from
mingott
he
was
conscious
of
a
growing
distaste
for
what
lay
before
him
there
was
nothing
unknown
or
unfamiliar
in
the
path
he
was
presumably
to
tread
but
when
he
had
trodden
it
before
it
was
as
a
free
man
who
was
accountable
to
no
one
for
his
actions
and
could
lend
himself
with
an
amused
detachment
to
the
game
of
precautions
and
prevarications
concealments
and
compliances
that
the
part
required
this
procedure
was
called
protecting
a
woman
honour
and
the
best
fiction
combined
with
the
talk
of
his
elders
had
long
since
initiated
him
into
every
detail
of
its
code
now
he
saw
the
matter
in
a
new
light
and
his
part
in
it
seemed
singularly
diminished
it
was
in
fact
that
which
with
a
secret
fatuity
he
had
watched
thorley
rushworth
play
toward
a
fond
and
unperceiving
husband
a
smiling
bantering
humouring
watchful
and
incessant
lie
a
lie
by
day
a
lie
by
night
a
lie
in
every
touch
and
every
look
a
lie
in
every
caress
and
every
quarrel
a
lie
in
every
word
and
in
every
silence
it
was
easier
and
less
dastardly
on
the
whole
for
a
wife
to
play
such
a
part
toward
her
husband
a
woman
standard
of
truthfulness
was
tacitly
held
to
be
lower
she
was
the
subject
creature
and
versed
in
the
arts
of
the
enslaved
then
she
could
always
plead
moods
and
nerves
and
the
right
not
to
be
held
too
strictly
to
account
and
even
in
the
most
societies
the
laugh
was
always
against
the
husband
but
in
archer
little
world
no
one
laughed
at
a
wife
deceived
and
a
certain
measure
of
contempt
was
attached
to
men
who
continued
their
philandering
after
marriage
in
the
rotation
of
crops
there
was
a
recognised
season
for
wild
oats
but
they
were
not
to
be
sown
more
than
once
archer
had
always
shared
this
view
in
his
heart
he
thought
lefferts
despicable
but
to
love
ellen
olenska
was
not
to
become
a
man
like
lefferts
for
the
first
time
archer
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
dread
argument
of
the
individual
case
ellen
olenska
was
like
no
other
woman
he
was
like
no
other
man
their
situation
therefore
resembled
no
one
else
and
they
were
answerable
to
no
tribunal
but
that
of
their
own
judgment
yes
but
in
ten
minutes
more
he
would
be
mounting
his
own
doorstep
and
there
were
may
and
habit
and
honour
and
all
the
old
decencies
that
he
and
his
people
had
always
believed
in
at
his
corner
he
hesitated
and
then
walked
on
down
fifth
avenue
ahead
of
him
in
the
winter
night
loomed
a
big
unlit
house
as
he
drew
near
he
thought
how
often
he
had
seen
it
blazing
with
lights
its
steps
awninged
and
carpeted
and
carriages
waiting
in
double
line
to
draw
up
at
the
curbstone
it
was
in
the
conservatory
that
stretched
its
bulk
down
the
side
street
that
he
had
taken
his
first
kiss
from
may
it
was
under
the
myriad
candles
of
the
that
he
had
seen
her
appear
tall
and
as
a
young
diana
now
the
house
was
as
dark
as
the
grave
except
for
a
faint
flare
of
gas
in
the
basement
and
a
light
in
one
upstairs
room
where
the
blind
had
not
been
lowered
as
archer
reached
the
corner
he
saw
that
the
carriage
standing
at
the
door
was
manson
mingott
what
an
opportunity
for
sillerton
jackson
if
he
should
chance
to
pass
archer
had
been
greatly
moved
by
old
catherine
account
of
madame
attitude
toward
beaufort
it
made
the
righteous
reprobation
of
new
york
seem
like
a
passing
by
on
the
other
side
but
he
knew
well
enough
what
construction
the
clubs
and
would
put
on
ellen
olenska
visits
to
her
cousin
he
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
lighted
window
no
doubt
the
two
women
were
sitting
together
in
that
room
beaufort
had
probably
sought
consolation
elsewhere
there
were
even
rumours
that
he
had
left
new
york
with
fanny
ring
but
beaufort
attitude
made
the
report
seem
improbable
archer
had
the
nocturnal
perspective
of
fifth
avenue
almost
to
himself
at
that
hour
most
people
were
indoors
dressing
for
dinner
and
he
was
secretly
glad
that
ellen
exit
was
likely
to
be
unobserved
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
the
door
opened
and
she
came
out
behind
her
was
a
faint
light
such
as
might
have
been
carried
down
the
stairs
to
show
her
the
way
she
turned
to
say
a
word
to
some
one
then
the
door
closed
and
she
came
down
the
steps
ellen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
she
reached
the
pavement
she
stopped
with
a
slight
start
and
just
then
he
saw
two
young
men
of
fashionable
cut
approaching
there
was
a
familiar
air
about
their
overcoats
and
the
way
their
smart
silk
mufflers
were
folded
over
their
white
ties
and
he
wondered
how
youths
of
their
quality
happened
to
be
dining
out
so
early
then
he
remembered
that
the
reggie
chiverses
whose
house
was
a
few
doors
above
were
taking
a
large
party
that
evening
to
see
adelaide
neilson
in
romeo
and
juliet
and
guessed
that
the
two
were
of
the
number
they
passed
under
a
lamp
and
he
recognised
lawrence
lefferts
and
a
young
chivers
a
mean
desire
not
to
have
madame
olenska
seen
at
the
beauforts
door
vanished
as
he
felt
the
penetrating
warmth
of
her
hand
i
shall
see
you
now
we
shall
be
together
he
broke
out
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
ah
she
answered
granny
has
told
you
while
he
watched
her
he
was
aware
that
lefferts
and
chivers
on
reaching
the
farther
side
of
the
street
corner
had
discreetly
struck
away
across
fifth
avenue
it
was
the
kind
of
masculine
solidarity
that
he
himself
often
practised
now
he
sickened
at
their
connivance
did
she
really
imagine
that
he
and
she
could
live
like
this
and
if
not
what
else
did
she
imagine
tomorrow
i
must
see
you
somewhere
where
we
can
be
alone
he
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
almost
angry
to
his
own
ears
she
wavered
and
moved
toward
the
carriage
but
i
shall
be
at
granny
for
the
present
that
is
she
added
as
if
conscious
that
her
change
of
plans
required
some
explanation
somewhere
where
we
can
be
alone
he
insisted
she
gave
a
faint
laugh
that
grated
on
him
in
new
york
but
there
are
no
churches
no
monuments
there
the
art
museum
in
the
park
he
explained
as
she
looked
puzzled
at
two
i
shall
be
at
the
door
she
turned
away
without
answering
and
got
quickly
into
the
carriage
as
it
drove
off
she
leaned
forward
and
he
thought
she
waved
her
hand
in
the
obscurity
he
stared
after
her
in
a
turmoil
of
contradictory
feelings
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
speaking
not
to
the
woman
he
loved
but
to
another
a
woman
he
was
indebted
to
for
pleasures
already
wearied
of
it
was
hateful
to
find
himself
the
prisoner
of
this
hackneyed
vocabulary
she
come
he
said
to
himself
almost
contemptuously
avoiding
the
popular
wolfe
collection
whose
anecdotic
canvases
filled
one
of
the
main
galleries
of
the
queer
wilderness
of
and
encaustic
tiles
known
as
the
metropolitan
museum
they
had
wandered
down
a
passage
to
the
room
where
the
cesnola
antiquities
mouldered
in
unvisited
loneliness
they
had
this
melancholy
retreat
to
themselves
and
seated
on
the
divan
enclosing
the
central
they
were
staring
silently
at
the
glass
cabinets
mounted
in
ebonised
wood
which
contained
the
recovered
fragments
of
ilium
it
odd
madame
olenska
said
i
never
came
here
before
ah
well
some
day
i
suppose
it
will
be
a
great
museum
yes
she
assented
absently
she
stood
up
and
wandered
across
the
room
archer
remaining
seated
watched
the
light
movements
of
her
figure
so
girlish
even
under
its
heavy
furs
the
cleverly
planted
heron
wing
in
her
fur
cap
and
the
way
a
dark
curl
lay
like
a
flattened
vine
spiral
on
each
cheek
above
the
ear
his
mind
as
always
when
they
first
met
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
delicious
details
that
made
her
herself
and
no
other
presently
he
rose
and
approached
the
case
before
which
she
stood
its
glass
shelves
were
crowded
with
small
broken
objects
hardly
recognisable
domestic
utensils
ornaments
and
personal
trifles
made
of
glass
of
clay
of
discoloured
bronze
and
other
substances
it
seems
cruel
she
said
that
after
a
while
nothing
matters
any
more
than
these
little
things
that
used
to
be
necessary
and
important
to
forgotten
people
and
now
have
to
be
guessed
at
under
a
magnifying
glass
and
labelled
unknown
yes
but
meanwhile
ah
meanwhile
as
she
stood
there
in
her
long
sealskin
coat
her
hands
thrust
in
a
small
round
muff
her
veil
drawn
down
like
a
transparent
mask
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
the
bunch
of
violets
he
had
brought
her
stirring
with
her
breath
it
seemed
incredible
that
this
pure
harmony
of
line
and
colour
should
ever
suffer
the
stupid
law
of
change
meanwhile
everything
matters
that
concerns
you
he
said
she
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
and
turned
back
to
the
divan
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
waited
but
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
echoing
far
off
down
the
empty
rooms
and
felt
the
pressure
of
the
minutes
what
is
it
you
wanted
to
tell
me
she
asked
as
if
she
had
received
the
same
warning
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
rejoined
why
that
i
believe
you
came
to
new
york
because
you
were
afraid
afraid
of
my
coming
to
washington
she
looked
down
at
her
muff
and
he
saw
her
hands
stir
in
it
uneasily
well
well
yes
she
said
you
were
afraid
you
knew
yes
i
knew
well
then
he
insisted
well
then
this
is
better
is
it
she
returned
with
a
long
questioning
sigh
better
we
shall
hurt
others
less
is
it
after
all
what
you
always
wanted
to
have
you
here
you
mean
in
reach
and
yet
out
of
reach
to
meet
you
in
this
way
on
the
sly
it
the
very
reverse
of
what
i
want
i
told
you
the
other
day
what
i
wanted
she
hesitated
and
you
still
think
this
worse
a
thousand
times
he
paused
it
would
be
easy
to
lie
to
you
but
the
truth
is
i
think
it
detestable
oh
so
do
i
she
cried
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
he
sprang
up
impatiently
well
then
it
my
turn
to
ask
what
is
it
in
god
name
that
you
think
better
she
hung
her
head
and
continued
to
clasp
and
unclasp
her
hands
in
her
muff
the
step
drew
nearer
and
a
guardian
in
a
braided
cap
walked
listlessly
through
the
room
like
a
ghost
stalking
through
a
necropolis
they
fixed
their
eyes
simultaneously
on
the
case
opposite
them
and
when
the
official
figure
had
vanished
down
a
vista
of
mummies
and
sarcophagi
archer
spoke
again
what
do
you
think
better
instead
of
answering
she
murmured
i
promised
granny
to
stay
with
her
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
here
i
should
be
safer
from
me
she
bent
her
head
slightly
without
looking
at
him
safer
from
loving
me
her
profile
did
not
stir
but
he
saw
a
tear
overflow
on
her
lashes
and
hang
in
a
mesh
of
her
veil
safer
from
doing
irreparable
harm
do
let
us
be
like
all
the
others
she
protested
what
others
i
do
profess
to
be
different
from
my
kind
consumed
by
the
same
wants
and
the
same
longings
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
kind
of
terror
and
he
saw
a
faint
colour
steal
into
her
cheeks
shall
i
once
come
to
you
and
then
go
home
she
suddenly
hazarded
in
a
low
clear
voice
the
blood
rushed
to
the
young
man
forehead
dearest
he
said
without
moving
it
seemed
as
if
he
held
his
heart
in
his
hands
like
a
full
cup
that
the
least
motion
might
overbrim
then
her
last
phrase
struck
his
ear
and
his
face
clouded
go
home
what
do
you
mean
by
going
home
home
to
my
husband
and
you
expect
me
to
say
yes
to
that
she
raised
her
troubled
eyes
to
his
what
else
is
there
i
stay
here
and
lie
to
the
people
who
been
good
to
me
but
that
the
very
reason
why
i
ask
you
to
come
away
and
destroy
their
lives
when
they
helped
me
to
remake
mine
archer
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
down
on
her
in
inarticulate
despair
it
would
have
been
easy
to
say
yes
come
come
once
he
knew
the
power
she
would
put
in
his
hands
if
she
consented
there
would
be
no
difficulty
then
in
persuading
her
not
to
go
back
to
her
husband
but
something
silenced
the
word
on
his
lips
a
sort
of
passionate
honesty
in
her
made
it
inconceivable
that
he
should
try
to
draw
her
into
that
familiar
trap
if
i
were
to
let
her
come
he
said
to
himself
i
should
have
to
let
her
go
again
and
that
was
not
to
be
imagined
but
he
saw
the
shadow
of
the
lashes
on
her
wet
cheek
and
wavered
after
all
he
began
again
we
have
lives
of
our
own
there
no
use
attempting
the
impossible
you
so
unprejudiced
about
some
things
so
used
as
you
say
to
looking
at
the
gorgon
that
i
know
why
you
afraid
to
face
our
case
and
see
it
as
it
really
is
unless
you
think
the
sacrifice
is
not
worth
making
she
stood
up
also
her
lips
tightening
under
a
rapid
frown
call
it
that
then
i
must
go
she
said
drawing
her
little
watch
from
her
bosom
she
turned
away
and
he
followed
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
well
then
come
to
me
once
he
said
his
head
turning
suddenly
at
the
thought
of
losing
her
and
for
a
second
or
two
they
looked
at
each
other
almost
like
enemies
when
he
insisted
tomorrow
she
hesitated
the
day
after
dearest
he
said
again
she
had
disengaged
her
wrist
but
for
a
moment
they
continued
to
hold
each
other
eyes
and
he
saw
that
her
face
which
had
grown
very
pale
was
flooded
with
a
deep
inner
radiance
his
heart
beat
with
awe
he
felt
that
he
had
never
before
beheld
love
visible
oh
i
shall
be
late
no
do
come
any
farther
than
this
she
cried
walking
hurriedly
away
down
the
long
room
as
if
the
reflected
radiance
in
his
eyes
had
frightened
her
when
she
reached
the
door
she
turned
for
a
moment
to
wave
a
quick
farewell
archer
walked
home
alone
darkness
was
falling
when
he
let
himself
into
his
house
and
he
looked
about
at
the
familiar
objects
in
the
hall
as
if
he
viewed
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
the
hearing
his
step
ran
up
the
stairs
to
light
the
gas
on
the
upper
landing
is
archer
in
no
sir
archer
went
out
in
the
carriage
after
luncheon
and
has
come
back
with
a
sense
of
relief
he
entered
the
library
and
flung
himself
down
in
his
armchair
the
followed
bringing
the
student
lamp
and
shaking
some
coals
onto
the
dying
fire
when
she
left
he
continued
to
sit
motionless
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
on
his
clasped
hands
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
grate
he
sat
there
without
conscious
thoughts
without
sense
of
the
lapse
of
time
in
a
deep
and
grave
amazement
that
seemed
to
suspend
life
rather
than
quicken
it
this
was
what
had
to
be
then
this
was
what
had
to
be
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
as
if
he
hung
in
the
clutch
of
doom
what
he
had
dreamed
of
had
been
so
different
that
there
was
a
mortal
chill
in
his
rapture
the
door
opened
and
may
came
in
i
dreadfully
late
you
were
worried
were
you
she
asked
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
with
one
of
her
rare
caresses
he
looked
up
astonished
is
it
late
after
seven
i
believe
you
been
asleep
she
laughed
and
drawing
out
her
hat
pins
tossed
her
velvet
hat
on
the
sofa
she
looked
paler
than
usual
but
sparkling
with
an
unwonted
animation
i
went
to
see
granny
and
just
as
i
was
going
away
ellen
came
in
from
a
walk
so
i
stayed
and
had
a
long
talk
with
her
it
was
ages
since
we
had
a
real
talk
she
had
dropped
into
her
usual
armchair
facing
his
and
was
running
her
fingers
through
her
rumpled
hair
he
fancied
she
expected
him
to
speak
a
really
good
talk
she
went
on
smiling
with
what
seemed
to
archer
an
unnatural
vividness
she
was
so
dear
just
like
the
old
ellen
i
afraid
i
have
been
fair
to
her
lately
i
sometimes
thought
archer
stood
up
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
out
of
the
radius
of
the
lamp
yes
you
thought
he
echoed
as
she
paused
well
perhaps
i
have
judged
her
fairly
she
so
different
at
least
on
the
surface
she
takes
up
such
odd
people
she
seems
to
like
to
make
herself
conspicuous
i
suppose
it
the
life
she
led
in
that
fast
european
society
no
doubt
we
seem
dreadfully
dull
to
her
but
i
do
want
to
judge
her
unfairly
she
paused
again
a
little
breathless
with
the
unwonted
length
of
her
speech
and
sat
with
her
lips
slightly
parted
and
a
deep
blush
on
her
cheeks
archer
as
he
looked
at
her
was
reminded
of
the
glow
which
had
suffused
her
face
in
the
mission
garden
at
augustine
he
became
aware
of
the
same
obscure
effort
in
her
the
same
reaching
out
toward
something
beyond
the
usual
range
of
her
vision
she
hates
ellen
he
thought
and
she
trying
to
overcome
the
feeling
and
to
get
me
to
help
her
to
overcome
it
the
thought
moved
him
and
for
a
moment
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
the
silence
between
them
and
throwing
himself
on
her
mercy
you
understand
do
you
she
went
on
why
the
family
have
sometimes
been
annoyed
we
all
did
what
we
could
for
her
at
first
but
she
never
seemed
to
understand
and
now
this
idea
of
going
to
see
beaufort
of
going
there
in
granny
carriage
i
afraid
she
quite
alienated
the
van
der
luydens
ah
said
archer
with
an
impatient
laugh
the
open
door
had
closed
between
them
again
it
time
to
dress
we
dining
out
are
we
he
asked
moving
from
the
fire
she
rose
also
but
lingered
near
the
hearth
as
he
walked
past
her
she
moved
forward
impulsively
as
though
to
detain
him
their
eyes
met
and
he
saw
that
hers
were
of
the
same
swimming
blue
as
when
he
had
left
her
to
drive
to
jersey
city
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
you
have
kissed
me
today
she
said
in
a
whisper
and
he
felt
her
tremble
in
his
arms
xxxii
at
the
court
of
the
tuileries
said
sillerton
jackson
with
his
reminiscent
smile
such
things
were
pretty
openly
tolerated
the
scene
was
the
van
der
luydens
black
walnut
in
madison
avenue
and
the
time
the
evening
after
newland
archer
visit
to
the
museum
of
art
and
van
der
luyden
had
come
to
town
for
a
few
days
from
skuytercliff
whither
they
had
precipitately
fled
at
the
announcement
of
beaufort
failure
it
had
been
represented
to
them
that
the
disarray
into
which
society
had
been
thrown
by
this
deplorable
affair
made
their
presence
in
town
more
necessary
than
ever
it
was
one
of
the
occasions
when
as
archer
put
it
they
owed
it
to
society
to
show
themselves
at
the
opera
and
even
to
open
their
own
doors
it
will
never
do
my
dear
louisa
to
let
people
like
lemuel
struthers
think
they
can
step
into
regina
shoes
it
is
just
at
such
times
that
new
people
push
in
and
get
a
footing
it
was
owing
to
the
epidemic
of
in
new
york
the
winter
struthers
first
appeared
that
the
married
men
slipped
away
to
her
house
while
their
wives
were
in
the
nursery
you
and
dear
henry
louisa
must
stand
in
the
breach
as
you
always
have
and
van
der
luyden
could
not
remain
deaf
to
such
a
call
and
reluctantly
but
heroically
they
had
come
to
town
unmuffled
the
house
and
sent
out
invitations
for
two
dinners
and
an
evening
reception
on
this
particular
evening
they
had
invited
sillerton
jackson
archer
and
newland
and
his
wife
to
go
with
them
to
the
opera
where
faust
was
being
sung
for
the
first
time
that
winter
nothing
was
done
without
ceremony
under
the
van
der
luyden
roof
and
though
there
were
but
four
guests
the
repast
had
begun
at
seven
punctually
so
that
the
proper
sequence
of
courses
might
be
served
without
haste
before
the
gentlemen
settled
down
to
their
cigars
archer
had
not
seen
his
wife
since
the
evening
before
he
had
left
early
for
the
office
where
he
had
plunged
into
an
accumulation
of
unimportant
business
in
the
afternoon
one
of
the
senior
partners
had
made
an
unexpected
call
on
his
time
and
he
had
reached
home
so
late
that
may
had
preceded
him
to
the
van
der
luydens
and
sent
back
the
carriage
now
across
the
skuytercliff
carnations
and
the
massive
plate
she
struck
him
as
pale
and
languid
but
her
eyes
shone
and
she
talked
with
exaggerated
animation
the
subject
which
had
called
forth
sillerton
jackson
favourite
allusion
had
been
brought
up
archer
fancied
not
without
intention
by
their
hostess
the
beaufort
failure
or
rather
the
beaufort
attitude
since
the
failure
was
still
a
fruitful
theme
for
the
moralist
and
after
it
had
been
thoroughly
examined
and
condemned
van
der
luyden
had
turned
her
scrupulous
eyes
on
may
archer
is
it
possible
dear
that
what
i
hear
is
true
i
was
told
your
grandmother
mingott
carriage
was
seen
standing
at
door
it
was
noticeable
that
she
no
longer
called
the
offending
lady
by
her
christian
name
may
colour
rose
and
archer
put
in
hastily
if
it
was
convinced
it
was
there
without
mingott
knowledge
ah
you
think
van
der
luyden
paused
sighed
and
glanced
at
her
husband
i
afraid
van
der
luyden
said
that
madame
olenska
kind
heart
may
have
led
her
into
the
imprudence
of
calling
on
mrs
beaufort
or
her
taste
for
peculiar
people
put
in
archer
in
a
dry
tone
while
her
eyes
dwelt
innocently
on
her
son
i
sorry
to
think
it
of
madame
olenska
said
van
der
luyden
and
archer
murmured
ah
my
dear
and
after
you
had
her
twice
at
skuytercliff
it
was
at
this
point
that
jackson
seized
the
chance
to
place
his
favourite
allusion
at
the
tuileries
he
repeated
seeing
the
eyes
of
the
company
expectantly
turned
on
him
the
standard
was
excessively
lax
in
some
respects
and
if
you
asked
where
morny
money
came
from
or
who
paid
the
debts
of
some
of
the
court
beauties
i
hope
dear
sillerton
said
archer
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
should
adopt
such
standards
i
never
suggest
returned
jackson
imperturbably
but
madame
olenska
foreign
may
make
her
less
particular
ah
the
two
elder
ladies
sighed
still
to
have
kept
her
grandmother
carriage
at
a
defaulter
door
van
der
luyden
protested
and
archer
guessed
that
he
was
remembering
and
resenting
the
hampers
of
carnations
he
had
sent
to
the
little
house
in
street
of
course
i
always
said
that
she
looks
at
things
quite
differently
archer
summed
up
a
flush
rose
to
may
forehead
she
looked
across
the
table
at
her
husband
and
said
precipitately
i
sure
ellen
meant
it
kindly
imprudent
people
are
often
kind
said
archer
as
if
the
fact
were
scarcely
an
extenuation
and
van
der
luyden
murmured
if
only
she
had
consulted
some
one
ah
that
she
never
did
archer
rejoined
at
this
point
van
der
luyden
glanced
at
his
wife
who
bent
her
head
slightly
in
the
direction
of
archer
and
the
glimmering
trains
of
the
three
ladies
swept
out
of
the
door
while
the
gentlemen
settled
down
to
their
cigars
van
der
luyden
supplied
short
ones
on
opera
nights
but
they
were
so
good
that
they
made
his
guests
deplore
his
inexorable
punctuality
archer
after
the
first
act
had
detached
himself
from
the
party
and
made
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
club
box
from
there
he
watched
over
various
chivers
mingott
and
rushworth
shoulders
the
same
scene
that
he
had
looked
at
two
years
previously
on
the
night
of
his
first
meeting
with
ellen
olenska
he
had
her
to
appear
again
in
old
mingott
box
but
it
remained
empty
and
he
sat
motionless
his
eyes
fastened
on
it
till
suddenly
madame
pure
soprano
broke
out
into
non
archer
turned
to
the
stage
where
in
the
familiar
setting
of
giant
roses
and
pansies
the
same
large
blonde
victim
was
succumbing
to
the
same
small
brown
seducer
from
the
stage
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
point
of
the
horseshoe
where
may
sat
between
two
older
ladies
just
as
on
that
former
evening
she
had
sat
between
lovell
mingott
and
her
foreign
cousin
as
on
that
evening
she
was
all
in
white
and
archer
who
had
not
noticed
what
she
wore
recognised
the
satin
and
old
lace
of
her
wedding
dress
it
was
the
custom
in
old
new
york
for
brides
to
appear
in
this
costly
garment
during
the
first
year
or
two
of
marriage
his
mother
he
knew
kept
hers
in
tissue
paper
in
the
hope
that
janey
might
some
day
wear
it
though
poor
janey
was
reaching
the
age
when
pearl
grey
poplin
and
no
bridesmaids
would
be
thought
more
appropriate
it
struck
archer
that
may
since
their
return
from
europe
had
seldom
worn
her
bridal
satin
and
the
surprise
of
seeing
her
in
it
made
him
compare
her
appearance
with
that
of
the
young
girl
he
had
watched
with
such
blissful
anticipations
two
years
earlier
though
may
outline
was
slightly
heavier
as
her
goddesslike
build
had
foretold
her
athletic
erectness
of
carriage
and
the
girlish
transparency
of
her
expression
remained
unchanged
but
for
the
slight
languor
that
archer
had
lately
noticed
in
her
she
would
have
been
the
exact
image
of
the
girl
playing
with
the
bouquet
of
on
her
betrothal
evening
the
fact
seemed
an
additional
appeal
to
his
pity
such
innocence
was
as
moving
as
the
trustful
clasp
of
a
child
then
he
remembered
the
passionate
generosity
latent
under
that
incurious
calm
he
recalled
her
glance
of
understanding
when
he
had
urged
that
their
engagement
should
be
announced
at
the
beaufort
ball
he
heard
the
voice
in
which
she
had
said
in
the
mission
garden
i
could
have
my
happiness
made
out
of
a
wrong
a
wrong
to
some
one
else
and
an
uncontrollable
longing
seized
him
to
tell
her
the
truth
to
throw
himself
on
her
generosity
and
ask
for
the
freedom
he
had
once
refused
newland
archer
was
a
quiet
and
young
man
conformity
to
the
discipline
of
a
small
society
had
become
almost
his
second
nature
it
was
deeply
distasteful
to
him
to
do
anything
melodramatic
and
conspicuous
anything
van
der
luyden
would
have
deprecated
and
the
club
box
condemned
as
bad
form
but
he
had
become
suddenly
unconscious
of
the
club
box
of
van
der
luyden
of
all
that
had
so
long
enclosed
him
in
the
warm
shelter
of
habit
he
walked
along
the
passage
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
opened
the
door
of
van
der
luyden
box
as
if
it
had
been
a
gate
into
the
unknown
thrilled
out
the
triumphant
marguerite
and
the
occupants
of
the
box
looked
up
in
surprise
at
archer
entrance
he
had
already
broken
one
of
the
rules
of
his
world
which
forbade
the
entering
of
a
box
during
a
solo
slipping
between
van
der
luyden
and
sillerton
jackson
he
leaned
over
his
wife
i
got
a
beastly
headache
do
tell
any
one
but
come
home
you
he
whispered
may
gave
him
a
glance
of
comprehension
and
he
saw
her
whisper
to
his
mother
who
nodded
sympathetically
then
she
murmured
an
excuse
to
van
der
luyden
and
rose
from
her
seat
just
as
marguerite
fell
into
faust
arms
archer
while
he
helped
her
on
with
her
opera
cloak
noticed
the
exchange
of
a
significant
smile
between
the
older
ladies
as
they
drove
away
may
laid
her
hand
shyly
on
his
i
so
sorry
you
do
feel
well
i
afraid
they
been
overworking
you
again
at
the
office
no
it
not
that
do
you
mind
if
i
open
the
window
he
returned
confusedly
letting
down
the
pane
on
his
side
he
sat
staring
out
into
the
street
feeling
his
wife
beside
him
as
a
silent
watchful
interrogation
and
keeping
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
passing
houses
at
their
door
she
caught
her
skirt
in
the
step
of
the
carriage
and
fell
against
him
did
you
hurt
yourself
he
asked
steadying
her
with
his
arm
no
but
my
poor
dress
see
how
i
torn
it
she
exclaimed
she
bent
to
gather
up
a
breadth
and
followed
him
up
the
steps
into
the
hall
the
servants
had
not
expected
them
so
early
and
there
was
only
a
glimmer
of
gas
on
the
upper
landing
archer
mounted
the
stairs
turned
up
the
light
and
put
a
match
to
the
brackets
on
each
side
of
the
library
mantelpiece
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
the
warm
friendly
aspect
of
the
room
smote
him
like
that
of
a
familiar
face
met
during
an
unavowable
errand
he
noticed
that
his
wife
was
very
pale
and
asked
if
he
should
get
her
some
brandy
oh
no
she
exclaimed
with
a
momentary
flush
as
she
took
off
her
cloak
but
had
you
better
go
to
bed
at
once
she
added
as
he
opened
a
silver
box
on
the
table
and
took
out
a
cigarette
archer
threw
down
the
cigarette
and
walked
to
his
usual
place
by
the
fire
no
my
head
is
not
as
bad
as
that
he
paused
and
something
i
want
to
say
something
important
that
i
must
tell
you
at
once
she
had
dropped
into
an
armchair
and
raised
her
head
as
he
spoke
yes
dear
she
rejoined
so
gently
that
he
wondered
at
the
lack
of
wonder
with
which
she
received
this
preamble
may
he
began
standing
a
few
feet
from
her
chair
and
looking
over
at
her
as
if
the
slight
distance
between
them
were
an
unbridgeable
abyss
the
sound
of
his
voice
echoed
uncannily
through
the
homelike
hush
and
he
repeated
there
is
something
i
got
to
tell
you
about
myself
she
sat
silent
without
a
movement
or
a
tremor
of
her
lashes
she
was
still
extremely
pale
but
her
face
had
a
curious
tranquillity
of
expression
that
seemed
drawn
from
some
secret
inner
source
archer
checked
the
conventional
phrases
of
that
were
crowding
to
his
lips
he
was
determined
to
put
the
case
baldly
without
vain
recrimination
or
excuse
madame
olenska
he
said
but
at
the
name
his
wife
raised
her
hand
as
if
to
silence
him
as
she
did
so
the
gaslight
struck
on
the
gold
of
her
oh
why
should
we
talk
about
ellen
tonight
she
asked
with
a
slight
pout
of
impatience
because
i
ought
to
have
spoken
before
her
face
remained
calm
is
it
really
worth
while
dear
i
know
been
unfair
to
her
at
times
perhaps
we
all
have
you
understood
her
no
doubt
better
than
we
did
you
always
been
kind
to
her
but
what
does
it
matter
now
it
all
over
archer
looked
at
her
blankly
could
it
be
possible
that
the
sense
of
unreality
in
which
he
felt
himself
imprisoned
had
communicated
itself
to
his
wife
all
over
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
an
indistinct
stammer
may
still
looked
at
him
with
transparent
eyes
why
since
she
going
back
to
europe
so
soon
since
granny
approves
and
understands
and
has
arranged
to
make
her
independent
of
her
husband
she
broke
off
and
archer
grasping
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
in
one
convulsed
hand
and
steadying
himself
against
it
made
a
vain
effort
to
extend
the
same
control
to
his
reeling
thoughts
i
supposed
he
heard
his
wife
even
voice
go
on
that
you
had
been
kept
at
the
office
this
evening
about
the
business
arrangements
it
was
settled
this
morning
i
believe
she
lowered
her
eyes
under
his
unseeing
stare
and
another
fugitive
flush
passed
over
her
face
he
understood
that
his
own
eyes
must
be
unbearable
and
turning
away
rested
his
elbows
on
the
and
covered
his
face
something
drummed
and
clanged
furiously
in
his
ears
he
could
not
tell
if
it
were
the
blood
in
his
veins
or
the
tick
of
the
clock
on
the
mantel
may
sat
without
moving
or
speaking
while
the
clock
slowly
measured
out
five
minutes
a
lump
of
coal
fell
forward
in
the
grate
and
hearing
her
rise
to
push
it
back
archer
at
length
turned
and
faced
her
it
impossible
he
exclaimed
impossible
how
do
you
know
what
you
just
told
me
i
saw
ellen
yesterday
i
told
you
i
seen
her
at
granny
it
was
then
that
she
told
you
no
i
had
a
note
from
her
this
do
you
want
to
see
it
he
could
not
find
his
voice
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
almost
immediately
i
thought
you
knew
she
said
simply
she
laid
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
and
archer
put
out
his
hand
and
took
it
up
the
letter
contained
only
a
few
lines
may
dear
i
have
at
last
made
granny
understand
that
my
visit
to
her
could
be
no
more
than
a
visit
and
she
has
been
as
kind
and
generous
as
ever
she
sees
now
that
if
i
return
to
europe
i
must
live
by
myself
or
rather
with
poor
aunt
medora
who
is
coming
with
me
i
am
hurrying
back
to
washington
to
pack
up
and
we
sail
next
week
you
must
be
very
good
to
granny
when
i
gone
as
good
as
you
always
been
to
me
ellen
if
any
of
my
friends
wish
to
urge
me
to
change
my
mind
please
tell
them
it
would
be
utterly
useless
archer
read
the
letter
over
two
or
three
times
then
he
flung
it
down
and
burst
out
laughing
the
sound
of
his
laugh
startled
him
it
recalled
janey
midnight
fright
when
she
had
caught
him
rocking
with
incomprehensible
mirth
over
may
telegram
announcing
that
the
date
of
their
marriage
had
been
advanced
why
did
she
write
this
he
asked
checking
his
laugh
with
a
supreme
effort
may
met
the
question
with
her
unshaken
candour
i
suppose
because
we
talked
things
over
yesterday
what
things
i
told
her
i
was
afraid
i
had
been
fair
to
her
had
always
understood
how
hard
it
must
have
been
for
her
here
alone
among
so
many
people
who
were
relations
and
yet
strangers
who
felt
the
right
to
criticise
and
yet
did
always
know
the
circumstances
she
paused
i
knew
you
been
the
one
friend
she
could
always
count
on
and
i
wanted
her
to
know
that
you
and
i
were
the
same
in
all
our
feelings
she
hesitated
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
speak
and
then
added
slowly
she
understood
my
wishing
to
tell
her
this
i
think
she
understands
everything
she
went
up
to
archer
and
taking
one
of
his
cold
hands
pressed
it
quickly
against
her
cheek
my
head
aches
too
dear
she
said
and
turned
to
the
door
her
torn
and
muddy
dragging
after
her
across
the
room
xxxiii
it
was
as
archer
smilingly
said
to
welland
a
great
event
for
a
young
couple
to
give
their
first
big
dinner
the
newland
archers
since
they
had
set
up
their
household
had
received
a
good
deal
of
company
in
an
informal
way
archer
was
fond
of
having
three
or
four
friends
to
dine
and
may
welcomed
them
with
the
beaming
readiness
of
which
her
mother
had
set
her
the
example
in
conjugal
affairs
her
husband
questioned
whether
if
left
to
herself
she
would
ever
have
asked
any
one
to
the
house
but
he
had
long
given
up
trying
to
disengage
her
real
self
from
the
shape
into
which
tradition
and
training
had
moulded
her
it
was
expected
that
young
couples
in
new
york
should
do
a
good
deal
of
informal
entertaining
and
a
welland
married
to
an
archer
was
doubly
pledged
to
the
tradition
but
a
big
dinner
with
a
hired
chef
and
two
borrowed
footmen
with
roman
punch
roses
from
henderson
and
menus
on
cards
was
a
different
affair
and
not
to
be
lightly
undertaken
as
archer
remarked
the
roman
punch
made
all
the
difference
not
in
itself
but
by
its
manifold
implications
since
it
signified
either
or
terrapin
two
soups
a
hot
and
a
cold
sweet
full
decolletage
with
short
sleeves
and
guests
of
a
proportionate
importance
it
was
always
an
interesting
occasion
when
a
young
pair
launched
their
first
invitations
in
the
third
person
and
their
summons
was
seldom
refused
even
by
the
seasoned
and
still
it
was
admittedly
a
triumph
that
the
van
der
luydens
at
may
request
should
have
stayed
over
in
order
to
be
present
at
her
farewell
dinner
for
the
countess
olenska
the
two
sat
in
may
on
the
afternoon
of
the
great
day
archer
writing
out
the
menus
on
tiffany
thickest
bristol
while
welland
superintended
the
placing
of
the
palms
and
standard
lamps
archer
arriving
late
from
his
office
found
them
still
there
archer
had
turned
her
attention
to
the
for
the
table
and
welland
was
considering
the
effect
of
bringing
forward
the
large
gilt
sofa
so
that
another
corner
might
be
created
between
the
piano
and
the
window
may
they
told
him
was
in
the
inspecting
the
mound
of
jacqueminot
roses
and
maidenhair
in
the
centre
of
the
long
table
and
the
placing
of
the
maillard
bonbons
in
openwork
silver
baskets
between
the
candelabra
on
the
piano
stood
a
large
basket
of
orchids
which
van
der
luyden
had
had
sent
from
skuytercliff
everything
was
in
short
as
it
should
be
on
the
approach
of
so
considerable
an
event
archer
ran
thoughtfully
over
the
list
checking
off
each
name
with
her
sharp
gold
pen
henry
van
der
luyden
louisa
the
lovell
mingotts
the
reggie
chiverses
lawrence
lefferts
and
gertrude
yes
i
suppose
may
was
right
to
have
them
the
selfridge
merrys
sillerton
jackson
van
newland
and
his
wife
how
time
passes
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
he
was
your
best
man
newland
and
countess
olenska
yes
i
think
that
all
welland
surveyed
her
affectionately
no
one
can
say
newland
that
you
and
may
are
not
giving
ellen
a
handsome
ah
well
said
archer
i
understand
may
wanting
her
cousin
to
tell
people
abroad
that
we
not
quite
barbarians
i
sure
ellen
will
appreciate
it
she
was
to
arrive
this
morning
i
believe
it
will
make
a
most
charming
last
impression
the
evening
before
sailing
is
usually
so
dreary
welland
cheerfully
continued
archer
turned
toward
the
door
and
his
called
to
him
do
go
in
and
have
a
peep
at
the
table
and
do
let
may
tire
herself
too
much
but
he
affected
not
to
hear
and
sprang
up
the
stairs
to
his
library
the
room
looked
at
him
like
an
alien
countenance
composed
into
a
polite
grimace
and
he
perceived
that
it
had
been
ruthlessly
tidied
and
prepared
by
a
judicious
distribution
of
and
boxes
for
the
gentlemen
to
smoke
in
ah
well
he
thought
it
not
for
long
and
he
went
on
to
his
ten
days
had
passed
since
madame
olenska
departure
from
new
york
during
those
ten
days
archer
had
had
no
sign
from
her
but
that
conveyed
by
the
return
of
a
key
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
and
sent
to
his
office
in
a
sealed
envelope
addressed
in
her
hand
this
retort
to
his
last
appeal
might
have
been
interpreted
as
a
classic
move
in
a
familiar
game
but
the
young
man
chose
to
give
it
a
different
meaning
she
was
still
fighting
against
her
fate
but
she
was
going
to
europe
and
she
was
not
returning
to
her
husband
nothing
therefore
was
to
prevent
his
following
her
and
once
he
had
taken
the
irrevocable
step
and
had
proved
to
her
that
it
was
irrevocable
he
believed
she
would
not
send
him
away
this
confidence
in
the
future
had
steadied
him
to
play
his
part
in
the
present
it
had
kept
him
from
writing
to
her
or
betraying
by
any
sign
or
act
his
misery
and
mortification
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
deadly
silent
game
between
them
the
trumps
were
still
in
his
hands
and
he
waited
there
had
been
nevertheless
moments
sufficiently
difficult
to
pass
as
when
letterblair
the
day
after
madame
olenska
departure
had
sent
for
him
to
go
over
the
details
of
the
trust
which
manson
mingott
wished
to
create
for
her
granddaughter
for
a
couple
of
hours
archer
had
examined
the
terms
of
the
deed
with
his
senior
all
the
while
obscurely
feeling
that
if
he
had
been
consulted
it
was
for
some
reason
other
than
the
obvious
one
of
his
cousinship
and
that
the
close
of
the
conference
would
reveal
it
well
the
lady
ca
deny
that
it
a
handsome
arrangement
letterblair
had
summed
up
after
mumbling
over
a
summary
of
the
settlement
in
fact
i
bound
to
say
she
been
treated
pretty
handsomely
all
round
all
round
archer
echoed
with
a
touch
of
derision
do
you
refer
to
her
husband
proposal
to
give
her
back
her
own
money
letterblair
bushy
eyebrows
went
up
a
fraction
of
an
inch
my
dear
sir
the
law
the
law
and
your
wife
cousin
was
married
under
the
french
law
it
to
be
presumed
she
knew
what
that
meant
even
if
she
did
what
happened
subsequently
but
archer
paused
letterblair
had
laid
his
against
his
big
corrugated
nose
and
was
looking
down
it
with
the
expression
assumed
by
virtuous
elderly
gentlemen
when
they
wish
their
youngers
to
understand
that
virtue
is
not
synonymous
with
ignorance
my
dear
sir
i
no
wish
to
extenuate
the
count
transgressions
but
but
on
the
other
side
i
would
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
well
that
there
had
been
tit
for
tat
with
the
young
champion
letterblair
unlocked
a
drawer
and
pushed
a
folded
paper
toward
archer
this
report
the
result
of
discreet
enquiries
and
then
as
archer
made
no
effort
to
glance
at
the
paper
or
to
repudiate
the
suggestion
the
lawyer
somewhat
flatly
continued
i
do
say
it
conclusive
you
observe
far
from
it
but
straws
show
and
on
the
whole
it
eminently
satisfactory
for
all
parties
that
this
dignified
solution
has
been
reached
oh
eminently
archer
assented
pushing
back
the
paper
a
day
or
two
later
on
responding
to
a
summons
from
manson
mingott
his
soul
had
been
more
deeply
tried
he
had
found
the
old
lady
depressed
and
querulous
you
know
she
deserted
me
she
began
at
once
and
without
waiting
for
his
reply
oh
do
ask
me
why
she
gave
so
many
reasons
that
i
forgotten
them
all
my
private
belief
is
that
she
could
face
the
boredom
at
any
rate
that
what
augusta
and
my
think
and
i
do
know
that
i
altogether
blame
her
olenski
a
finished
scoundrel
but
life
with
him
must
have
been
a
good
deal
gayer
than
it
is
in
fifth
avenue
not
that
the
family
would
admit
that
they
think
fifth
avenue
is
heaven
with
the
rue
de
la
paix
thrown
in
and
poor
ellen
of
course
has
no
idea
of
going
back
to
her
husband
she
held
out
as
firmly
as
ever
against
that
so
she
to
settle
down
in
paris
with
that
fool
medora
well
paris
is
paris
and
you
can
keep
a
carriage
there
on
next
to
nothing
but
she
was
as
gay
as
a
bird
and
i
shall
miss
her
two
tears
the
parched
tears
of
the
old
rolled
down
her
puffy
cheeks
and
vanished
in
the
abysses
of
her
bosom
all
i
ask
is
she
concluded
that
they
should
bother
me
any
more
i
must
really
be
allowed
to
digest
my
gruel
and
she
twinkled
a
little
wistfully
at
archer
it
was
that
evening
on
his
return
home
that
may
announced
her
intention
of
giving
a
farewell
dinner
to
her
cousin
madame
name
had
not
been
pronounced
between
them
since
the
night
of
her
flight
to
washington
and
archer
looked
at
his
wife
with
surprise
a
dinner
why
he
interrogated
her
colour
rose
but
you
like
ellen
i
thought
you
be
pleased
it
awfully
nice
your
putting
it
in
that
way
but
i
really
see
i
mean
to
do
it
newland
she
said
quietly
rising
and
going
to
her
desk
here
are
the
invitations
all
written
mother
helped
me
she
agrees
that
we
ought
to
she
paused
embarrassed
and
yet
smiling
and
archer
suddenly
saw
before
him
the
embodied
image
of
the
family
oh
all
right
he
said
staring
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
list
of
guests
that
she
had
put
in
his
hand
when
he
entered
the
before
dinner
may
was
stooping
over
the
fire
and
trying
to
coax
the
logs
to
burn
in
their
unaccustomed
setting
of
immaculate
tiles
the
tall
lamps
were
all
lit
and
van
der
luyden
orchids
had
been
conspicuously
disposed
in
various
receptacles
of
modern
porcelain
and
knobby
silver
newland
archer
was
generally
thought
a
great
success
a
gilt
bamboo
jardiniere
in
which
the
primulas
and
cinerarias
were
punctually
renewed
blocked
the
access
to
the
bay
window
where
the
would
have
preferred
a
bronze
reduction
of
the
venus
of
milo
the
sofas
and
of
pale
brocade
were
cleverly
grouped
about
little
plush
tables
densely
covered
with
silver
toys
porcelain
animals
and
efflorescent
photograph
frames
and
tall
lamps
shot
up
like
tropical
flowers
among
the
palms
i
do
think
ellen
has
ever
seen
this
room
lighted
up
said
may
rising
flushed
from
her
struggle
and
sending
about
her
a
glance
of
pardonable
pride
the
brass
tongs
which
she
had
propped
against
the
side
of
the
chimney
fell
with
a
crash
that
drowned
her
answer
and
before
he
could
restore
them
and
van
der
luyden
were
announced
the
other
guests
quickly
followed
for
it
was
known
that
the
van
der
luydens
liked
to
dine
punctually
the
room
was
nearly
full
and
archer
was
engaged
in
showing
to
selfridge
merry
a
small
verbeckhoven
study
of
sheep
which
welland
had
given
may
for
christmas
when
he
found
madame
olenska
at
his
side
she
was
excessively
pale
and
her
pallor
made
her
dark
hair
seem
denser
and
heavier
than
ever
perhaps
that
or
the
fact
that
she
had
wound
several
rows
of
amber
beads
about
her
neck
reminded
him
suddenly
of
the
little
ellen
mingott
he
had
danced
with
at
children
parties
when
medora
manson
had
first
brought
her
to
new
york
the
amber
beads
were
trying
to
her
complexion
or
her
dress
was
perhaps
unbecoming
her
face
looked
lustreless
and
almost
ugly
and
he
had
never
loved
it
as
he
did
at
that
minute
their
hands
met
and
he
thought
he
heard
her
say
yes
we
sailing
tomorrow
in
the
russia
then
there
was
an
unmeaning
noise
of
opening
doors
and
after
an
interval
may
voice
newland
dinner
been
announced
wo
you
please
take
ellen
in
madame
olenska
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
he
noticed
that
the
hand
was
ungloved
and
remembered
how
he
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
it
the
evening
that
he
had
sat
with
her
in
the
little
street
all
the
beauty
that
had
forsaken
her
face
seemed
to
have
taken
refuge
in
the
long
pale
fingers
and
faintly
dimpled
knuckles
on
his
sleeve
and
he
said
to
himself
if
it
were
only
to
see
her
hand
again
i
should
have
to
follow
her
it
was
only
at
an
entertainment
ostensibly
offered
to
a
foreign
visitor
that
van
der
luyden
could
suffer
the
diminution
of
being
placed
on
her
host
left
the
fact
of
madame
olenska
foreignness
could
hardly
have
been
more
adroitly
emphasised
than
by
this
farewell
tribute
and
van
der
luyden
accepted
her
displacement
with
an
affability
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
approval
there
were
certain
things
that
had
to
be
done
and
if
done
at
all
done
handsomely
and
thoroughly
and
one
of
these
in
the
old
new
york
code
was
the
tribal
rally
around
a
kinswoman
about
to
be
eliminated
from
the
tribe
there
was
nothing
on
earth
that
the
wellands
and
mingotts
would
not
have
done
to
proclaim
their
unalterable
affection
for
the
countess
olenska
now
that
her
passage
for
europe
was
engaged
and
archer
at
the
head
of
his
table
sat
marvelling
at
the
silent
untiring
activity
with
which
her
popularity
had
been
retrieved
grievances
against
her
silenced
her
past
countenanced
and
her
present
irradiated
by
the
family
approval
van
der
luyden
shone
on
her
with
the
dim
benevolence
which
was
her
nearest
approach
to
cordiality
and
van
der
luyden
from
his
seat
at
may
right
cast
down
the
table
glances
plainly
intended
to
justify
all
the
carnations
he
had
sent
from
skuytercliff
archer
who
seemed
to
be
assisting
at
the
scene
in
a
state
of
odd
imponderability
as
if
he
floated
somewhere
between
chandelier
and
ceiling
wondered
at
nothing
so
much
as
his
own
share
in
the
proceedings
as
his
glance
travelled
from
one
placid
face
to
another
he
saw
all
the
people
engaged
upon
as
a
band
of
dumb
conspirators
and
himself
and
the
pale
woman
on
his
right
as
the
centre
of
their
conspiracy
and
then
it
came
over
him
in
a
vast
flash
made
up
of
many
broken
gleams
that
to
all
of
them
he
and
madame
olenska
were
lovers
lovers
in
the
extreme
sense
peculiar
to
foreign
vocabularies
he
guessed
himself
to
have
been
for
months
the
centre
of
countless
silently
observing
eyes
and
patiently
listening
ears
he
understood
that
by
means
as
yet
unknown
to
him
the
separation
between
himself
and
the
partner
of
his
guilt
had
been
achieved
and
that
now
the
whole
tribe
had
rallied
about
his
wife
on
the
tacit
assumption
that
nobody
knew
anything
or
had
ever
imagined
anything
and
that
the
occasion
of
the
entertainment
was
simply
may
archer
natural
desire
to
take
an
affectionate
leave
of
her
friend
and
cousin
it
was
the
old
new
york
way
of
taking
life
without
effusion
of
blood
the
way
of
people
who
dreaded
scandal
more
than
disease
who
placed
decency
above
courage
and
who
considered
that
nothing
was
more
than
scenes
except
the
behaviour
of
those
who
gave
rise
to
them
as
these
thoughts
succeeded
each
other
in
his
mind
archer
felt
like
a
prisoner
in
the
centre
of
an
armed
camp
he
looked
about
the
table
and
guessed
at
the
inexorableness
of
his
captors
from
the
tone
in
which
over
the
asparagus
from
florida
they
were
dealing
with
beaufort
and
his
wife
it
to
show
me
he
thought
what
would
happen
to
me
and
a
deathly
sense
of
the
superiority
of
implication
and
analogy
over
direct
action
and
of
silence
over
rash
words
closed
in
on
him
like
the
doors
of
the
family
vault
he
laughed
and
met
van
der
luyden
startled
eyes
you
think
it
laughable
she
said
with
a
pinched
smile
of
course
poor
regina
idea
of
remaining
in
new
york
has
its
ridiculous
side
i
suppose
and
archer
muttered
of
course
at
this
point
he
became
conscious
that
madame
olenska
other
neighbour
had
been
engaged
for
some
time
with
the
lady
on
his
right
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
that
may
serenely
enthroned
between
van
der
luyden
and
selfridge
merry
had
cast
a
quick
glance
down
the
table
it
was
evident
that
the
host
and
the
lady
on
his
right
could
not
sit
through
the
whole
meal
in
silence
he
turned
to
madame
olenska
and
her
pale
smile
met
him
oh
do
let
see
it
through
it
seemed
to
say
did
you
find
the
journey
tiring
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
surprised
him
by
its
naturalness
and
she
answered
that
on
the
contrary
she
had
seldom
travelled
with
fewer
discomforts
except
you
know
the
dreadful
heat
in
the
train
she
added
and
he
remarked
that
she
would
not
suffer
from
that
particular
hardship
in
the
country
she
was
going
to
i
never
he
declared
with
intensity
was
more
nearly
frozen
than
once
in
april
in
the
train
between
calais
and
paris
she
said
she
did
not
wonder
but
remarked
that
after
all
one
could
always
carry
an
extra
rug
and
that
every
form
of
travel
had
its
hardships
to
which
he
abruptly
returned
that
he
thought
them
all
of
no
account
compared
with
the
blessedness
of
getting
away
she
changed
colour
and
he
added
his
voice
suddenly
rising
in
pitch
i
mean
to
do
a
lot
of
travelling
myself
before
long
a
tremor
crossed
her
face
and
leaning
over
to
reggie
chivers
he
cried
out
i
say
reggie
what
do
you
say
to
a
trip
round
the
world
now
next
month
i
mean
game
if
you
are
at
which
reggie
piped
up
that
she
could
not
think
of
letting
reggie
go
till
after
the
martha
washington
ball
she
was
getting
up
for
the
blind
asylum
in
easter
week
and
her
husband
placidly
observed
that
by
that
time
he
would
have
to
be
practising
for
the
international
polo
match
but
selfridge
merry
had
caught
the
phrase
round
the
world
and
having
once
circled
the
globe
in
his
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
send
down
the
table
several
striking
items
concerning
the
shallowness
of
the
mediterranean
ports
though
after
all
he
added
it
did
matter
for
when
you
seen
athens
and
smyrna
and
constantinople
what
else
was
there
and
merry
said
she
could
never
be
too
grateful
to
bencomb
for
having
made
them
promise
not
to
go
to
naples
on
account
of
the
fever
but
you
must
have
three
weeks
to
do
india
properly
her
husband
conceded
anxious
to
have
it
understood
that
he
was
no
frivolous
and
at
this
point
the
ladies
went
up
to
the
in
the
library
in
spite
of
weightier
presences
lawrence
lefferts
predominated
the
talk
as
usual
had
veered
around
to
the
beauforts
and
even
van
der
luyden
and
selfridge
merry
installed
in
the
honorary
tacitly
reserved
for
them
paused
to
listen
to
the
younger
man
philippic
never
had
lefferts
so
abounded
in
the
sentiments
that
adorn
christian
manhood
and
exalt
the
sanctity
of
the
home
indignation
lent
him
a
scathing
eloquence
and
it
was
clear
that
if
others
had
followed
his
example
and
acted
as
he
talked
society
would
never
have
been
weak
enough
to
receive
a
foreign
upstart
like
beaufort
no
sir
not
even
if
he
married
a
van
der
luyden
or
a
lanning
instead
of
a
dallas
and
what
chance
would
there
have
been
lefferts
wrathfully
questioned
of
his
marrying
into
such
a
family
as
the
dallases
if
he
had
not
already
wormed
his
way
into
certain
houses
as
people
like
lemuel
struthers
had
managed
to
worm
theirs
in
his
wake
if
society
chose
to
open
its
doors
to
vulgar
women
the
harm
was
not
great
though
the
gain
was
doubtful
but
once
it
got
in
the
way
of
tolerating
men
of
obscure
origin
and
tainted
wealth
the
end
was
total
disintegration
and
at
no
distant
date
if
things
go
on
at
this
pace
lefferts
thundered
looking
like
a
young
prophet
dressed
by
poole
and
who
had
not
yet
been
stoned
we
shall
see
our
children
fighting
for
invitations
to
swindlers
houses
and
marrying
beaufort
bastards
oh
i
say
draw
it
mild
reggie
chivers
and
young
newland
protested
while
selfridge
merry
looked
genuinely
alarmed
and
an
expression
of
pain
and
disgust
settled
on
van
der
luyden
sensitive
face
has
he
got
any
cried
sillerton
jackson
pricking
up
his
ears
and
while
lefferts
tried
to
turn
the
question
with
a
laugh
the
old
gentleman
twittered
into
archer
ear
queer
those
fellows
who
are
always
wanting
to
set
things
right
the
people
who
have
the
worst
cooks
are
always
telling
you
they
poisoned
when
they
dine
out
but
i
hear
there
are
pressing
reasons
for
our
friend
diatribe
typewriter
this
time
i
understand
the
talk
swept
past
archer
like
some
senseless
river
running
and
running
because
it
did
not
know
enough
to
stop
he
saw
on
the
faces
about
him
expressions
of
interest
amusement
and
even
mirth
he
listened
to
the
younger
men
laughter
and
to
the
praise
of
the
archer
madeira
which
van
der
luyden
and
merry
were
thoughtfully
celebrating
through
it
all
he
was
dimly
aware
of
a
general
attitude
of
friendliness
toward
himself
as
if
the
guard
of
the
prisoner
he
felt
himself
to
be
were
trying
to
soften
his
captivity
and
the
perception
increased
his
passionate
determination
to
be
free
in
the
where
they
presently
joined
the
ladies
he
met
may
triumphant
eyes
and
read
in
them
the
conviction
that
everything
had
gone
off
beautifully
she
rose
from
madame
olenska
side
and
immediately
van
der
luyden
beckoned
the
latter
to
a
seat
on
the
gilt
sofa
where
she
throned
selfridge
merry
bore
across
the
room
to
join
them
and
it
became
clear
to
archer
that
here
also
a
conspiracy
of
rehabilitation
and
obliteration
was
going
on
the
silent
organisation
which
held
his
little
world
together
was
determined
to
put
itself
on
record
as
never
for
a
moment
having
questioned
the
propriety
of
madame
olenska
conduct
or
the
completeness
of
archer
domestic
felicity
all
these
amiable
and
inexorable
persons
were
resolutely
engaged
in
pretending
to
each
other
that
they
had
never
heard
of
suspected
or
even
conceived
possible
the
least
hint
to
the
contrary
and
from
this
tissue
of
elaborate
mutual
dissimulation
archer
once
more
disengaged
the
fact
that
new
york
believed
him
to
be
madame
lover
he
caught
the
glitter
of
victory
in
his
wife
eyes
and
for
the
first
time
understood
that
she
shared
the
belief
the
discovery
roused
a
laughter
of
inner
devils
that
reverberated
through
all
his
efforts
to
discuss
the
martha
washington
ball
with
reggie
chivers
and
little
newland
and
so
the
evening
swept
on
running
and
running
like
a
senseless
river
that
did
not
know
how
to
stop
at
length
he
saw
that
madame
olenska
had
risen
and
was
saying
he
understood
that
in
a
moment
she
would
be
gone
and
tried
to
remember
what
he
had
said
to
her
at
dinner
but
he
could
not
recall
a
single
word
they
had
exchanged
she
went
up
to
may
the
rest
of
the
company
making
a
circle
about
her
as
she
advanced
the
two
young
women
clasped
hands
then
may
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
cousin
certainly
our
hostess
is
much
the
handsomer
of
the
two
archer
heard
reggie
chivers
say
in
an
undertone
to
young
newland
and
he
remembered
beaufort
coarse
sneer
at
may
ineffectual
beauty
a
moment
later
he
was
in
the
hall
putting
madame
olenska
cloak
about
her
shoulders
through
all
his
confusion
of
mind
he
had
held
fast
to
the
resolve
to
say
nothing
that
might
startle
or
disturb
her
convinced
that
no
power
could
now
turn
him
from
his
purpose
he
had
found
strength
to
let
events
shape
themselves
as
they
would
but
as
he
followed
madame
olenska
into
the
hall
he
thought
with
a
sudden
hunger
of
being
for
a
moment
alone
with
her
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
is
your
carriage
here
he
asked
and
at
that
moment
van
der
luyden
who
was
being
majestically
inserted
into
her
sables
said
gently
we
are
driving
dear
ellen
home
archer
heart
gave
a
jerk
and
madame
olenska
clasping
her
cloak
and
fan
with
one
hand
held
out
the
other
to
him
she
said
but
i
shall
see
you
soon
in
paris
he
answered
aloud
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
shouted
it
oh
she
murmured
if
you
and
may
could
come
van
der
luyden
advanced
to
give
her
his
arm
and
archer
turned
to
van
der
luyden
for
a
moment
in
the
billowy
darkness
inside
the
big
landau
he
caught
the
dim
oval
of
a
face
eyes
shining
steadily
and
she
was
gone
as
he
went
up
the
steps
he
crossed
lawrence
lefferts
coming
down
with
his
wife
lefferts
caught
his
host
by
the
sleeve
drawing
back
to
let
gertrude
pass
i
say
old
chap
do
you
mind
just
letting
it
be
understood
that
dining
with
you
at
the
club
tomorrow
night
thanks
so
much
you
old
brick
it
did
go
off
beautifully
did
it
may
questioned
from
the
threshold
of
the
library
archer
roused
himself
with
a
start
as
soon
as
the
last
carriage
had
driven
away
he
had
come
up
to
the
library
and
shut
himself
in
with
the
hope
that
his
wife
who
still
lingered
below
would
go
straight
to
her
room
but
there
she
stood
pale
and
drawn
yet
radiating
the
factitious
energy
of
one
who
has
passed
beyond
fatigue
may
i
come
and
talk
it
over
she
asked
of
course
if
you
like
but
you
must
be
awfully
sleepy
no
i
not
sleepy
i
should
like
to
sit
with
you
a
little
very
well
he
said
pushing
her
chair
near
the
fire
she
sat
down
and
he
resumed
his
seat
but
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
at
length
archer
began
abruptly
since
you
not
tired
and
want
to
talk
there
something
i
must
tell
you
i
tried
to
the
other
night
she
looked
at
him
quickly
yes
dear
something
about
yourself
about
myself
you
say
you
not
tired
well
i
am
horribly
tired
in
an
instant
she
was
all
tender
anxiety
oh
i
seen
it
coming
on
newland
you
been
so
wickedly
overworked
perhaps
it
that
anyhow
i
want
to
make
a
break
a
break
to
give
up
the
law
to
go
away
at
any
rate
at
once
on
a
long
trip
ever
so
far
off
away
from
everything
he
paused
conscious
that
he
had
failed
in
his
attempt
to
speak
with
the
indifference
of
a
man
who
longs
for
a
change
and
is
yet
too
weary
to
welcome
it
do
what
he
would
the
chord
of
eagerness
vibrated
away
from
everything
he
repeated
ever
so
far
where
for
instance
she
asked
oh
i
do
know
india
or
japan
she
stood
up
and
as
he
sat
with
bent
head
his
chin
propped
on
his
hands
he
felt
her
warmly
and
fragrantly
hovering
over
him
as
far
as
that
but
i
afraid
you
ca
dear
she
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
not
unless
you
take
me
with
you
and
then
as
he
was
silent
she
went
on
in
tones
so
clear
and
that
each
separate
syllable
tapped
like
a
little
hammer
on
his
brain
that
is
if
the
doctors
will
let
me
go
but
i
afraid
they
wo
for
you
see
newland
i
been
sure
since
this
morning
of
something
i
been
so
longing
and
hoping
for
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
sick
stare
and
she
sank
down
all
dew
and
roses
and
hid
her
face
against
his
knee
oh
my
dear
he
said
holding
her
to
him
while
his
cold
hand
stroked
her
hair
there
was
a
long
pause
which
the
inner
devils
filled
with
strident
laughter
then
may
freed
herself
from
his
arms
and
stood
up
you
did
guess
yes
i
no
that
is
of
course
i
hoped
they
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
again
fell
silent
then
turning
his
eyes
from
hers
he
asked
abruptly
have
you
told
any
one
else
only
mamma
and
your
mother
she
paused
and
then
added
hurriedly
the
blood
flushing
up
to
her
forehead
that
is
and
ellen
you
know
i
told
you
we
had
a
long
talk
one
afternoon
and
how
dear
she
was
to
me
ah
said
archer
his
heart
stopping
he
felt
that
his
wife
was
watching
him
intently
did
you
mind
my
telling
her
first
newland
mind
why
should
i
he
made
a
last
effort
to
collect
himself
but
that
was
a
fortnight
ago
was
it
i
thought
you
said
you
sure
till
today
her
colour
burned
deeper
but
she
held
his
gaze
no
i
was
sure
then
but
i
told
her
i
was
and
you
see
i
was
right
she
exclaimed
her
blue
eyes
wet
with
victory
xxxiv
newland
archer
sat
at
the
in
his
library
in
east
street
he
had
just
got
back
from
a
big
official
reception
for
the
inauguration
of
the
new
galleries
at
the
metropolitan
museum
and
the
spectacle
of
those
great
spaces
crowded
with
the
spoils
of
the
ages
where
the
throng
of
fashion
circulated
through
a
series
of
scientifically
catalogued
treasures
had
suddenly
pressed
on
a
rusted
spring
of
memory
why
this
used
to
be
one
of
the
old
cesnola
rooms
he
heard
some
one
say
and
instantly
everything
about
him
vanished
and
he
was
sitting
alone
on
a
hard
leather
divan
against
a
radiator
while
a
slight
figure
in
a
long
sealskin
cloak
moved
away
down
the
vista
of
the
old
museum
the
vision
had
roused
a
host
of
other
associations
and
he
sat
looking
with
new
eyes
at
the
library
which
for
over
thirty
years
had
been
the
scene
of
his
solitary
musings
and
of
all
the
family
confabulations
it
was
the
room
in
which
most
of
the
real
things
of
his
life
had
happened
there
his
wife
nearly
years
ago
had
broken
to
him
with
a
blushing
circumlocution
that
would
have
caused
the
young
women
of
the
new
generation
to
smile
the
news
that
she
was
to
have
a
child
and
there
their
eldest
boy
dallas
too
delicate
to
be
taken
to
church
in
midwinter
had
been
christened
by
their
old
friend
the
bishop
of
new
york
the
ample
magnificent
irreplaceable
bishop
so
long
the
pride
and
ornament
of
his
diocese
there
dallas
had
first
staggered
across
the
floor
shouting
dad
while
may
and
the
nurse
laughed
behind
the
door
there
their
second
child
mary
who
was
so
like
her
mother
had
announced
her
engagement
to
the
dullest
and
most
reliable
of
reggie
chivers
many
sons
and
there
archer
had
kissed
her
through
her
wedding
veil
before
they
went
down
to
the
motor
which
was
to
carry
them
to
grace
church
for
in
a
world
where
all
else
had
reeled
on
its
foundations
the
grace
church
wedding
remained
an
unchanged
institution
it
was
in
the
library
that
he
and
may
had
always
discussed
the
future
of
the
children
the
studies
of
dallas
and
his
young
brother
bill
mary
incurable
indifference
to
accomplishments
and
passion
for
sport
and
philanthropy
and
the
vague
leanings
toward
art
which
had
finally
landed
the
restless
and
curious
dallas
in
the
office
of
a
rising
new
york
architect
the
young
men
nowadays
were
emancipating
themselves
from
the
law
and
business
and
taking
up
all
sorts
of
new
things
if
they
were
not
absorbed
in
state
politics
or
municipal
reform
the
chances
were
that
they
were
going
in
for
central
american
archaeology
for
architecture
or
taking
a
keen
and
learned
interest
in
the
prerevolutionary
buildings
of
their
own
country
studying
and
adapting
georgian
types
and
protesting
at
the
meaningless
use
of
the
word
colonial
nobody
nowadays
had
colonial
houses
except
the
millionaire
grocers
of
the
suburbs
but
above
all
sometimes
archer
put
it
above
all
it
was
in
that
library
that
the
governor
of
new
york
coming
down
from
albany
one
evening
to
dine
and
spend
the
night
had
turned
to
his
host
and
said
banging
his
clenched
fist
on
the
table
and
gnashing
his
hang
the
professional
politician
you
the
kind
of
man
the
country
wants
archer
if
the
stable
ever
to
be
cleaned
out
men
like
you
have
got
to
lend
a
hand
in
the
cleaning
men
like
you
how
archer
had
glowed
at
the
phrase
how
eagerly
he
had
risen
up
at
the
call
it
was
an
echo
of
ned
winsett
old
appeal
to
roll
his
sleeves
up
and
get
down
into
the
muck
but
spoken
by
a
man
who
set
the
example
of
the
gesture
and
whose
summons
to
follow
him
was
irresistible
archer
as
he
looked
back
was
not
sure
that
men
like
himself
were
what
his
country
needed
at
least
in
the
active
service
to
which
theodore
roosevelt
had
pointed
in
fact
there
was
reason
to
think
it
did
not
for
after
a
year
in
the
state
assembly
he
had
not
been
and
had
dropped
back
thankfully
into
obscure
if
useful
municipal
work
and
from
that
again
to
the
writing
of
occasional
articles
in
one
of
the
reforming
weeklies
that
were
trying
to
shake
the
country
out
of
its
apathy
it
was
little
enough
to
look
back
on
but
when
he
remembered
to
what
the
young
men
of
his
generation
and
his
set
had
looked
forward
the
narrow
groove
of
sport
and
society
to
which
their
vision
had
been
limited
even
his
small
contribution
to
the
new
state
of
things
seemed
to
count
as
each
brick
counts
in
a
wall
he
had
done
little
in
public
life
he
would
always
be
by
nature
a
contemplative
and
a
dilettante
but
he
had
had
high
things
to
contemplate
great
things
to
delight
in
and
one
great
man
friendship
to
be
his
strength
and
pride
he
had
been
in
short
what
people
were
beginning
to
call
a
good
citizen
in
new
york
for
many
years
past
every
new
movement
philanthropic
municipal
or
artistic
had
taken
account
of
his
opinion
and
wanted
his
name
people
said
ask
archer
when
there
was
a
question
of
starting
the
first
school
for
crippled
children
reorganising
the
museum
of
art
founding
the
grolier
club
inaugurating
the
new
library
or
getting
up
a
new
society
of
chamber
music
his
days
were
full
and
they
were
filled
decently
he
supposed
it
was
all
a
man
ought
to
ask
something
he
knew
he
had
missed
the
flower
of
life
but
he
thought
of
it
now
as
a
thing
so
unattainable
and
improbable
that
to
have
repined
would
have
been
like
despairing
because
one
had
not
drawn
the
first
prize
in
a
lottery
there
were
a
hundred
million
tickets
in
his
lottery
and
there
was
only
one
prize
the
chances
had
been
too
decidedly
against
him
when
he
thought
of
ellen
olenska
it
was
abstractly
serenely
as
one
might
think
of
some
imaginary
beloved
in
a
book
or
a
picture
she
had
become
the
composite
vision
of
all
that
he
had
missed
that
vision
faint
and
tenuous
as
it
was
had
kept
him
from
thinking
of
other
women
he
had
been
what
was
called
a
faithful
husband
and
when
may
had
suddenly
died
carried
off
by
the
infectious
pneumonia
through
which
she
had
nursed
their
youngest
child
he
had
honestly
mourned
her
their
long
years
together
had
shown
him
that
it
did
not
so
much
matter
if
marriage
was
a
dull
duty
as
long
as
it
kept
the
dignity
of
a
duty
lapsing
from
that
it
became
a
mere
battle
of
ugly
appetites
looking
about
him
he
honoured
his
own
past
and
mourned
for
it
after
all
there
was
good
in
the
old
ways
his
eyes
making
the
round
of
the
room
done
over
by
dallas
with
english
mezzotints
chippendale
cabinets
bits
of
chosen
and
pleasantly
shaded
electric
lamps
came
back
to
the
old
eastlake
that
he
had
never
been
willing
to
banish
and
to
his
first
photograph
of
may
which
still
kept
its
place
beside
his
inkstand
there
she
was
tall
and
willowy
in
her
starched
muslin
and
flapping
leghorn
as
he
had
seen
her
under
the
in
the
mission
garden
and
as
he
had
seen
her
that
day
so
she
had
remained
never
quite
at
the
same
height
yet
never
far
below
it
generous
faithful
unwearied
but
so
lacking
in
imagination
so
incapable
of
growth
that
the
world
of
her
youth
had
fallen
into
pieces
and
rebuilt
itself
without
her
ever
being
conscious
of
the
change
this
hard
bright
blindness
had
kept
her
immediate
horizon
apparently
unaltered
her
incapacity
to
recognise
change
made
her
children
conceal
their
views
from
her
as
archer
concealed
his
there
had
been
from
the
first
a
joint
pretence
of
sameness
a
kind
of
innocent
family
hypocrisy
in
which
father
and
children
had
unconsciously
collaborated
and
she
had
died
thinking
the
world
a
good
place
full
of
loving
and
harmonious
households
like
her
own
and
resigned
to
leave
it
because
she
was
convinced
that
whatever
happened
newland
would
continue
to
inculcate
in
dallas
the
same
principles
and
prejudices
which
had
shaped
his
parents
lives
and
that
dallas
in
turn
when
newland
followed
her
would
transmit
the
sacred
trust
to
little
bill
and
of
mary
she
was
sure
as
of
her
own
self
so
having
snatched
little
bill
from
the
grave
and
given
her
life
in
the
effort
she
went
contentedly
to
her
place
in
the
archer
vault
in
mark
where
archer
already
lay
safe
from
the
terrifying
trend
which
her
had
never
even
become
aware
of
opposite
may
portrait
stood
one
of
her
daughter
mary
chivers
was
as
tall
and
fair
as
her
mother
but
and
slightly
slouching
as
the
altered
fashion
required
mary
mighty
feats
of
athleticism
could
not
have
been
performed
with
the
waist
that
may
archer
azure
sash
so
easily
spanned
and
the
difference
seemed
symbolic
the
mother
life
had
been
as
closely
girt
as
her
figure
mary
who
was
no
less
conventional
and
no
more
intelligent
yet
led
a
larger
life
and
held
more
tolerant
views
there
was
good
in
the
new
order
too
the
telephone
clicked
and
archer
turning
from
the
photographs
unhooked
the
transmitter
at
his
elbow
how
far
they
were
from
the
days
when
the
legs
of
the
messenger
boy
had
been
new
only
means
of
quick
communication
chicago
wants
you
ah
it
must
be
a
from
dallas
who
had
been
sent
to
chicago
by
his
firm
to
talk
over
the
plan
of
the
lakeside
palace
they
were
to
build
for
a
young
millionaire
with
ideas
the
firm
always
sent
dallas
on
such
errands

dallas
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
the
room
the
voice
was
as
near
by
and
natural
as
if
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
favourite
by
the
fire
the
fact
would
not
ordinarily
have
surprised
archer
for
telephoning
had
become
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
electric
lighting
and
atlantic
voyages
but
the
laugh
did
startle
him
it
still
seemed
wonderful
that
across
all
those
miles
and
miles
of
country
forest
river
mountain
prairie
roaring
cities
and
busy
indifferent
millions
dallas
laugh
should
be
able
to
say
of
course
whatever
happens
i
must
get
back
on
the
first
because
fanny
beaufort
and
i
are
to
be
married
on
the
fifth
the
voice
began
again
think
it
over
no
sir
not
a
minute
got
to
say
yes
now
why
not
i
like
to
know
if
you
can
allege
a
single
reason
no
i
knew
it
then
it
a
go
eh
because
i
count
on
you
to
ring
up
the
cunard
office
first
thing
tomorrow
and
you
better
book
a
return
on
a
boat
from
marseilles
i
say
dad
it
be
our
last
time
together
in
this
kind
of
way
oh
good
i
knew
you
would
chicago
rang
off
and
archer
rose
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
it
would
be
their
last
time
together
in
this
kind
of
way
the
boy
was
right
they
would
have
lots
of
other
times
after
dallas
marriage
his
father
was
sure
for
the
two
were
born
comrades
and
fanny
beaufort
whatever
one
might
think
of
her
did
not
seem
likely
to
interfere
with
their
intimacy
on
the
contrary
from
what
he
had
seen
of
her
he
thought
she
would
be
naturally
included
in
it
still
change
was
change
and
differences
were
differences
and
much
as
he
felt
himself
drawn
toward
his
future
it
was
tempting
to
seize
this
last
chance
of
being
alone
with
his
boy
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
seize
it
except
the
profound
one
that
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
travel
may
had
disliked
to
move
except
for
valid
reasons
such
as
taking
the
children
to
the
sea
or
in
the
mountains
she
could
imagine
no
other
motive
for
leaving
the
house
in
street
or
their
comfortable
quarters
at
the
wellands
in
newport
after
dallas
had
taken
his
degree
she
had
thought
it
her
duty
to
travel
for
six
months
and
the
whole
family
had
made
the
tour
through
england
switzerland
and
italy
their
time
being
limited
no
one
knew
why
they
had
omitted
france
archer
remembered
dallas
wrath
at
being
asked
to
contemplate
mont
blanc
instead
of
rheims
and
chartres
but
mary
and
bill
wanted
and
had
already
yawned
their
way
in
dallas
wake
through
the
english
cathedrals
and
may
always
fair
to
her
children
had
insisted
on
holding
the
balance
evenly
between
their
athletic
and
artistic
proclivities
she
had
indeed
proposed
that
her
husband
should
go
to
paris
for
a
fortnight
and
join
them
on
the
italian
lakes
after
they
had
done
switzerland
but
archer
had
declined
we
stick
together
he
said
and
may
face
had
brightened
at
his
setting
such
a
good
example
to
dallas
since
her
death
nearly
two
years
before
there
had
been
no
reason
for
his
continuing
in
the
same
routine
his
children
had
urged
him
to
travel
mary
chivers
had
felt
sure
it
would
do
him
good
to
go
abroad
and
see
the
galleries
the
very
mysteriousness
of
such
a
cure
made
her
the
more
confident
of
its
efficacy
but
archer
had
found
himself
held
fast
by
habit
by
memories
by
a
sudden
startled
shrinking
from
new
things
now
as
he
reviewed
his
past
he
saw
into
what
a
deep
rut
he
had
sunk
the
worst
of
doing
one
duty
was
that
it
apparently
unfitted
one
for
doing
anything
else
at
least
that
was
the
view
that
the
men
of
his
generation
had
taken
the
trenchant
divisions
between
right
and
wrong
honest
and
dishonest
respectable
and
the
reverse
had
left
so
little
scope
for
the
unforeseen
there
are
moments
when
a
man
imagination
so
easily
subdued
to
what
it
lives
in
suddenly
rises
above
its
daily
level
and
surveys
the
long
windings
of
destiny
archer
hung
there
and
wondered
what
was
left
of
the
little
world
he
had
grown
up
in
and
whose
standards
had
bent
and
bound
him
he
remembered
a
sneering
prophecy
of
poor
lawrence
lefferts
uttered
years
ago
in
that
very
room
if
things
go
on
at
this
rate
our
children
will
be
marrying
bastards
it
was
just
what
archer
eldest
son
the
pride
of
his
life
was
doing
and
nobody
wondered
or
reproved
even
the
boy
aunt
janey
who
still
looked
so
exactly
as
she
used
to
in
her
elderly
youth
had
taken
her
mother
emeralds
and
out
of
their
pink
and
carried
them
with
her
own
twitching
hands
to
the
future
bride
and
fanny
beaufort
instead
of
looking
disappointed
at
not
receiving
a
set
from
a
paris
jeweller
had
exclaimed
at
their
beauty
and
declared
that
when
she
wore
them
she
should
feel
like
an
isabey
miniature
fanny
beaufort
who
had
appeared
in
new
york
at
eighteen
after
the
death
of
her
parents
had
won
its
heart
much
as
madame
olenska
had
won
it
thirty
years
earlier
only
instead
of
being
distrustful
and
afraid
of
her
society
took
her
joyfully
for
granted
she
was
pretty
amusing
and
accomplished
what
more
did
any
one
want
nobody
was
enough
to
rake
up
against
her
the
facts
of
her
past
and
her
own
origin
only
the
older
people
remembered
so
obscure
an
incident
in
the
business
life
of
new
york
as
beaufort
failure
or
the
fact
that
after
his
wife
death
he
had
been
quietly
married
to
the
notorious
fanny
ring
and
had
left
the
country
with
his
new
wife
and
a
little
girl
who
inherited
her
beauty
he
was
subsequently
heard
of
in
constantinople
then
in
russia
and
a
dozen
years
later
american
travellers
were
handsomely
entertained
by
him
in
buenos
ayres
where
he
represented
a
large
insurance
agency
he
and
his
wife
died
there
in
the
odour
of
prosperity
and
one
day
their
orphaned
daughter
had
appeared
in
new
york
in
charge
of
may
archer
jack
welland
whose
husband
had
been
appointed
the
girl
guardian
the
fact
threw
her
into
almost
cousinly
relationship
with
newland
children
and
nobody
was
surprised
when
dallas
engagement
was
announced
nothing
could
more
dearly
give
the
measure
of
the
distance
that
the
world
had
travelled
people
nowadays
were
too
busy
busy
with
reforms
and
movements
with
fads
and
fetishes
and
frivolities
to
bother
much
about
their
neighbours
and
of
what
account
was
anybody
past
in
the
huge
kaleidoscope
where
all
the
social
atoms
spun
around
on
the
same
plane
newland
archer
looking
out
of
his
hotel
window
at
the
stately
gaiety
of
the
paris
streets
felt
his
heart
beating
with
the
confusion
and
eagerness
of
youth
it
was
long
since
it
had
thus
plunged
and
reared
under
his
widening
waistcoat
leaving
him
the
next
minute
with
an
empty
breast
and
hot
temples
he
wondered
if
it
was
thus
that
his
son
conducted
itself
in
the
presence
of
miss
fanny
beaufort
and
decided
that
it
was
not
it
functions
as
actively
no
doubt
but
the
rhythm
is
different
he
reflected
recalling
the
cool
composure
with
which
the
young
man
had
announced
his
engagement
and
taken
for
granted
that
his
family
would
approve
the
difference
is
that
these
young
people
take
it
for
granted
that
they
going
to
get
whatever
they
want
and
that
we
almost
always
took
it
for
granted
that
we
should
only
i
wonder
the
thing
one
so
certain
of
in
advance
can
it
ever
make
one
heart
beat
as
wildly
it
was
the
day
after
their
arrival
in
paris
and
the
spring
sunshine
held
archer
in
his
open
window
above
the
wide
silvery
prospect
of
the
place
vendome
one
of
the
things
he
had
stipulated
almost
the
only
one
when
he
had
agreed
to
come
abroad
with
dallas
was
that
in
paris
he
should
be
made
to
go
to
one
of
the
newfangled
palaces
oh
all
right
of
course
dallas
agreed
i
take
you
to
some
jolly
place
the
bristol
say
leaving
his
father
speechless
at
hearing
that
the
home
of
kings
and
emperors
was
now
spoken
of
as
an
inn
where
one
went
for
its
quaint
inconveniences
and
lingering
local
colour
archer
had
pictured
often
enough
in
the
first
impatient
years
the
scene
of
his
return
to
paris
then
the
personal
vision
had
faded
and
he
had
simply
tried
to
see
the
city
as
the
setting
of
madame
life
sitting
alone
at
night
in
his
library
after
the
household
had
gone
to
bed
he
had
evoked
the
radiant
outbreak
of
spring
down
the
avenues
of
the
flowers
and
statues
in
the
public
gardens
the
whiff
of
lilacs
from
the
the
majestic
roll
of
the
river
under
the
great
bridges
and
the
life
of
art
and
study
and
pleasure
that
filled
each
mighty
artery
to
bursting
now
the
spectacle
was
before
him
in
its
glory
and
as
he
looked
out
on
it
he
felt
shy
inadequate
a
mere
grey
speck
of
a
man
compared
with
the
ruthless
magnificent
fellow
he
had
dreamed
of
being
dallas
hand
came
down
cheerily
on
his
shoulder
hullo
father
this
is
something
like
is
it
they
stood
for
a
while
looking
out
in
silence
and
then
the
young
man
continued
by
the
way
i
got
a
message
for
you
the
countess
olenska
expects
us
both
at
five
he
said
it
lightly
carelessly
as
he
might
have
imparted
any
casual
item
of
information
such
as
the
hour
at
which
their
train
was
to
leave
for
florence
the
next
evening
archer
looked
at
him
and
thought
he
saw
in
his
gay
young
eyes
a
gleam
of
his
malice
oh
did
i
tell
you
dallas
pursued
fanny
made
me
swear
to
do
three
things
while
i
was
in
paris
get
her
the
score
of
the
last
debussy
songs
go
to
the
and
see
madame
olenska
you
know
she
was
awfully
good
to
fanny
when
beaufort
sent
her
over
from
buenos
ayres
to
the
assomption
fanny
had
any
friends
in
paris
and
madame
olenska
used
to
be
kind
to
her
and
trot
her
about
on
holidays
i
believe
she
was
a
great
friend
of
the
first
beaufort
and
she
our
cousin
of
course
so
i
rang
her
up
this
morning
before
i
went
out
and
told
her
you
and
i
were
here
for
two
days
and
wanted
to
see
her
archer
continued
to
stare
at
him
you
told
her
i
was
here
of
course
why
not
dallas
eye
brows
went
up
whimsically
then
getting
no
answer
he
slipped
his
arm
through
his
father
with
a
confidential
pressure
i
say
father
what
was
she
like
archer
felt
his
colour
rise
under
his
son
unabashed
gaze
come
own
up
you
and
she
were
great
pals
were
you
was
she
most
awfully
lovely
lovely
i
do
know
she
was
different
ah
there
you
have
it
that
what
it
always
comes
to
does
it
when
she
comes
she
different
and
one
does
know
why
exactly
what
i
feel
about
fanny
his
father
drew
back
a
step
releasing
his
arm
about
fanny
but
my
dear
fellow
i
should
hope
so
only
i
do
see
dash
it
dad
do
be
prehistoric
was
she
once
your
fanny
dallas
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
new
generation
he
was
the
of
newland
and
may
archer
yet
it
had
never
been
possible
to
inculcate
in
him
even
the
rudiments
of
reserve
what
the
use
of
making
mysteries
it
only
makes
people
want
to
nose
out
he
always
objected
when
enjoined
to
discretion
but
archer
meeting
his
eyes
saw
the
filial
light
under
their
banter
my
fanny
well
the
woman
you
have
chucked
everything
for
only
you
did
continued
his
surprising
son
i
did
echoed
archer
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
no
you
date
you
see
dear
old
boy
but
mother
said
your
mother
yes
the
day
before
she
died
it
was
when
she
sent
for
me
alone
you
remember
she
said
she
knew
we
were
safe
with
you
and
always
would
be
because
once
when
she
asked
you
to
you
given
up
the
thing
you
most
wanted
archer
received
this
strange
communication
in
silence
his
eyes
remained
unseeingly
fixed
on
the
thronged
sunlit
square
below
the
window
at
length
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
never
asked
me
no
i
forgot
you
never
did
ask
each
other
anything
did
you
and
you
never
told
each
other
anything
you
just
sat
and
watched
each
other
and
guessed
at
what
was
going
on
underneath
a
asylum
in
fact
well
i
back
your
generation
for
knowing
more
about
each
other
private
thoughts
than
we
ever
have
time
to
find
out
about
our
i
say
dad
dallas
broke
off
you
not
angry
with
me
if
you
are
let
make
it
up
and
go
and
lunch
at
henri
i
got
to
rush
out
to
versailles
afterward
archer
did
not
accompany
his
son
to
versailles
he
preferred
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
solitary
roamings
through
paris
he
had
to
deal
all
at
once
with
the
packed
regrets
and
stifled
memories
of
an
inarticulate
lifetime
after
a
little
while
he
did
not
regret
dallas
indiscretion
it
seemed
to
take
an
iron
band
from
his
heart
to
know
that
after
all
some
one
had
guessed
and
pitied
and
that
it
should
have
been
his
wife
moved
him
indescribably
dallas
for
all
his
affectionate
insight
would
not
have
understood
that
to
the
boy
no
doubt
the
episode
was
only
a
pathetic
instance
of
vain
frustration
of
wasted
forces
but
was
it
really
no
more
for
a
long
time
archer
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
champs
elysees
and
wondered
while
the
stream
of
life
rolled
by
a
few
streets
away
a
few
hours
away
ellen
olenska
waited
she
had
never
gone
back
to
her
husband
and
when
he
had
died
some
years
before
she
had
made
no
change
in
her
way
of
living
there
was
nothing
now
to
keep
her
and
archer
apart
and
that
afternoon
he
was
to
see
her
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
the
tuileries
gardens
to
the
louvre
she
had
once
told
him
that
she
often
went
there
and
he
had
a
fancy
to
spend
the
intervening
time
in
a
place
where
he
could
think
of
her
as
perhaps
having
lately
been
for
an
hour
or
more
he
wandered
from
gallery
to
gallery
through
the
dazzle
of
afternoon
light
and
one
by
one
the
pictures
burst
on
him
in
their
splendour
filling
his
soul
with
the
long
echoes
of
beauty
after
all
his
life
had
been
too
starved
suddenly
before
an
effulgent
titian
he
found
himself
saying
but
i
only
and
then
he
turned
away
for
such
summer
dreams
it
was
too
late
but
surely
not
for
a
quiet
harvest
of
friendship
of
comradeship
in
the
blessed
hush
of
her
nearness
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
where
he
and
dallas
were
to
meet
and
together
they
walked
again
across
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
over
the
bridge
that
leads
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
dallas
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
father
mind
was
talking
excitedly
and
abundantly
of
versailles
he
had
had
but
one
previous
glimpse
of
it
during
a
holiday
trip
in
which
he
had
tried
to
pack
all
the
sights
he
had
been
deprived
of
when
he
had
had
to
go
with
the
family
to
switzerland
and
tumultuous
enthusiasm
and
criticism
tripped
each
other
up
on
his
lips
as
archer
listened
his
sense
of
inadequacy
and
inexpressiveness
increased
the
boy
was
not
insensitive
he
knew
but
he
had
the
facility
and
that
came
of
looking
at
fate
not
as
a
master
but
as
an
equal
that
it
they
feel
equal
to
things
they
know
their
way
about
he
mused
thinking
of
his
son
as
the
spokesman
of
the
new
generation
which
had
swept
away
all
the
old
landmarks
and
with
them
the
and
the
suddenly
dallas
stopped
short
grasping
his
father
arm
oh
by
jove
he
exclaimed
they
had
come
out
into
the
great
space
before
the
invalides
the
dome
of
mansart
floated
ethereally
above
the
budding
trees
and
the
long
grey
front
of
the
building
drawing
up
into
itself
all
the
rays
of
afternoon
light
it
hung
there
like
the
visible
symbol
of
the
race
glory
archer
knew
that
madame
olenska
lived
in
a
square
near
one
of
the
avenues
radiating
from
the
invalides
and
he
had
pictured
the
quarter
as
quiet
and
almost
obscure
forgetting
the
central
splendour
that
lit
it
up
now
by
some
queer
process
of
association
that
golden
light
became
for
him
the
pervading
illumination
in
which
she
lived
for
nearly
thirty
years
her
life
of
which
he
knew
so
strangely
little
had
been
spent
in
this
rich
atmosphere
that
he
already
felt
to
be
too
dense
and
yet
too
stimulating
for
his
lungs
he
thought
of
the
theatres
she
must
have
been
to
the
pictures
she
must
have
looked
at
the
sober
and
splendid
old
houses
she
must
have
frequented
the
people
she
must
have
talked
with
the
incessant
stir
of
ideas
curiosities
images
and
associations
thrown
out
by
an
intensely
social
race
in
a
setting
of
immemorial
manners
and
suddenly
he
remembered
the
young
frenchman
who
had
once
said
to
him
ah
good
conversation
there
is
nothing
like
it
is
there
archer
had
not
seen
riviere
or
heard
of
him
for
nearly
thirty
years
and
that
fact
gave
the
measure
of
his
ignorance
of
madame
olenska
existence
more
than
half
a
lifetime
divided
them
and
she
had
spent
the
long
interval
among
people
he
did
not
know
in
a
society
he
but
faintly
guessed
at
in
conditions
he
would
never
wholly
understand
during
that
time
he
had
been
living
with
his
youthful
memory
of
her
but
she
had
doubtless
had
other
and
more
tangible
companionship
perhaps
she
too
had
kept
her
memory
of
him
as
something
apart
but
if
she
had
it
must
have
been
like
a
relic
in
a
small
dim
chapel
where
there
was
not
time
to
pray
every
day
they
had
crossed
the
place
des
invalides
and
were
walking
down
one
of
the
thoroughfares
flanking
the
building
it
was
a
quiet
quarter
after
all
in
spite
of
its
splendour
and
its
history
and
the
fact
gave
one
an
idea
of
the
riches
paris
had
to
draw
on
since
such
scenes
as
this
were
left
to
the
few
and
the
indifferent
the
day
was
fading
into
a
soft
haze
pricked
here
and
there
by
a
yellow
electric
light
and
passers
were
rare
in
the
little
square
into
which
they
had
turned
dallas
stopped
again
and
looked
up
it
must
be
here
he
said
slipping
his
arm
through
his
father
with
a
movement
from
which
archer
shyness
did
not
shrink
and
they
stood
together
looking
up
at
the
house
it
was
a
modern
building
without
distinctive
character
but
and
pleasantly
balconied
up
its
wide
front
on
one
of
the
upper
balconies
which
hung
well
above
the
rounded
tops
of
the
in
the
square
the
awnings
were
still
lowered
as
though
the
sun
had
just
left
it
i
wonder
which
floor
dallas
conjectured
and
moving
toward
the
he
put
his
head
into
the
porter
lodge
and
came
back
to
say
the
fifth
it
must
be
the
one
with
the
awnings
archer
remained
motionless
gazing
at
the
upper
windows
as
if
the
end
of
their
pilgrimage
had
been
attained
i
say
you
know
it
nearly
six
his
son
at
length
reminded
him
the
father
glanced
away
at
an
empty
bench
under
the
trees
i
believe
i
sit
there
a
moment
he
said
why
are
you
well
his
son
exclaimed
oh
perfectly
but
i
should
like
you
please
to
go
up
without
me
dallas
paused
before
him
visibly
bewildered
but
i
say
dad
do
you
mean
you
wo
come
up
at
all
i
do
know
said
archer
slowly
if
you
do
she
wo
understand
go
my
boy
perhaps
i
shall
follow
you
dallas
gave
him
a
long
look
through
the
twilight
but
what
on
earth
shall
i
say
my
dear
fellow
do
you
always
know
what
to
say
his
father
rejoined
with
a
smile
very
well
i
shall
say
you
and
prefer
walking
up
the
five
flights
because
you
do
like
lifts
his
father
smiled
again
say
i
that
enough
dallas
looked
at
him
again
and
then
with
an
incredulous
gesture
passed
out
of
sight
under
the
vaulted
doorway
archer
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
continued
to
gaze
at
the
awninged
balcony
he
calculated
the
time
it
would
take
his
son
to
be
carried
up
in
the
lift
to
the
fifth
floor
to
ring
the
bell
and
be
admitted
to
the
hall
and
then
ushered
into
the
he
pictured
dallas
entering
that
room
with
his
quick
assured
step
and
his
delightful
smile
and
wondered
if
the
people
were
right
who
said
that
his
boy
took
after
him
then
he
tried
to
see
the
persons
already
in
the
room
for
probably
at
that
sociable
hour
there
would
be
more
than
one
and
among
them
a
dark
lady
pale
and
dark
who
would
look
up
quickly
half
rise
and
hold
out
a
long
thin
hand
with
three
rings
on
it
he
thought
she
would
be
sitting
in
a
near
the
fire
with
azaleas
banked
behind
her
on
a
table
it
more
real
to
me
here
than
if
i
went
up
he
suddenly
heard
himself
say
and
the
fear
lest
that
last
shadow
of
reality
should
lose
its
edge
kept
him
rooted
to
his
seat
as
the
minutes
succeeded
each
other
he
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
bench
in
the
thickening
dusk
his
eyes
never
turning
from
the
balcony
at
length
a
light
shone
through
the
windows
and
a
moment
later
a
came
out
on
the
balcony
drew
up
the
awnings
and
closed
the
shutters
at
that
as
if
it
had
been
the
signal
he
waited
for
newland
archer
got
up
slowly
and
walked
back
alone
to
his
hotel
