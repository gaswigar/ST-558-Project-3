introduction
with
the
end
of
the
century
there
has
come
in
france
a
great
revival
of
the
struggle
between
religion
and
free
thought
which
has
so
long
been
waged
there
and
the
stupendous
effort
put
forth
by
the
roman
catholic
church
to
annihilate
the
third
republic
has
placed
the
country
in
a
condition
of
unrest
such
as
it
has
only
known
on
the
eve
of
its
chief
revolutions
behind
the
notorious
dreyfus
case
behind
the
shouts
of
live
the
army
and
to
the
jews
behind
all
the
nationalism
and
militarism
the
church
has
been
steadily
incessantly
working
ever
fanning
the
flames
of
discord
ever
promoting
and
fostering
coalitions
of
malcontents
by
whose
help
it
hopes
to
recover
its
paramountcy
time
alone
can
reveal
the
outcome
of
this
great
effort
this
hope
assault
upon
institutions
which
have
hitherto
kept
catholicism
in
check
and
tended
so
largely
to
the
diffusion
of
free
thought
but
personally
i
am
inclined
to
think
with
all
due
allowance
for
partial
successes
achieved
here
and
there
that
this
clerical
movement
however
skilfully
engineered
under
the
cloak
of
patriotism
and
however
lavishly
financed
by
the
bulk
of
the
money
derived
from
the
lourdes
over
which
the
assumptionist
fathers
preside
and
the
offerings
of
zealots
throughout
the
country
will
ultimately
result
in
failure
for
france
is
not
at
heart
a
religious
country
and
when
faith
has
departed
from
a
nation
can
it
be
restored
the
meaning
of
the
clerical
movement
to
which
i
have
referred
is
twofold
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
perfectly
natural
and
legitimate
desire
of
the
french
catholics
to
recover
lost
ascendancy
and
in
the
second
place
there
is
the
conviction
of
the
vatican
and
the
french
episcopate
generally
that
france
is
the
only
country
which
under
favourable
circumstances
might
be
in
a
position
to
restore
the
temporal
power
of
the
holy
see
in
that
respect
the
pope
can
hope
for
nothing
from
spain
or
austria
or
the
catholic
states
of
germany
in
france
rests
the
sole
hope
of
the
papacy
and
thus
on
political
as
well
as
religious
grounds
the
establishment
of
a
catholic
in
place
of
the
republic
is
the
one
great
dream
of
those
who
direct
the
fortunes
of
the
holy
roman
and
apostolic
church
all
who
know
anything
of
modern
history
are
aware
that
in
a
french
army
overthrew
the
roman
republic
and
reinstated
pius
ix
in
possession
of
the
patrimony
of
peter
and
that
in
after
years
until
france
indeed
was
vanquished
at
sedan
the
presence
of
french
forces
alone
enabled
the
pope
to
continue
in
the
exercise
of
his
territorial
sway
both
the
royalist
reactionaries
who
sat
in
the
national
assembly
of
the
second
republic
and
the
of
that
time
afterwards
napoleon
lent
support
to
pius
and
in
return
expected
to
receive
the
countenance
and
help
of
the
french
clergy
in
their
various
designs
upon
france
but
the
clergy
always
seeks
its
own
ends
and
more
than
once
its
policy
varied
now
being
in
favour
of
the
royalists
and
now
in
favour
of
louis
napoleon
according
as
it
seemed
likely
to
secure
greater
benefits
from
one
or
the
other
even
when
the
contest
for
supremacy
was
over
when
the
republic
had
been
murdered
at
the
coup
and
the
hopes
of
the
count
de
chambord
had
been
destroyed
by
the
triumph
of
napoleon
the
little
the
clergy
did
not
give
unqualified
support
to
the
new
government
true
on
the
of
january
monseigneur
sibour
archbishop
of
paris
officiated
at
a
solemn
deum
at
notre
dame
in
honour
of
the
triumph
of
a
bribed
and
drunken
soldiery
over
the
defenders
of
the
constitution
but
louis
napoleon
had
scarcely
become
emperor
before
a
large
section
of
the
clergy
began
to
protest
that
the
new
was
by
no
means
sufficiently
clerical
the
course
adopted
in
these
circumstances
was
very
characteristic
and
significant
an
education
law
had
been
passed
in
giving
many
privileges
and
advantages
to
the
clergy
such
indeed
as
they
had
not
possessed
since
the
downfall
of
charles
x
but
comparative
liberty
in
educational
matters
was
more
than
the
french
episcopate
eager
for
domination
as
the
price
of
its
adhesion
to
imperialism
could
willingly
allow
and
before
long
a
celebrated
and
remarkably
well
written
newspaper
initiated
a
campaign
against
the
empire
taking
as
its
standpoint
that
the
pope
was
the
virtual
sovereign
of
the
world
and
that
everything
must
be
subservient
to
the
interests
of
the
roman
church
half
the
french
episcopate
actively
supported
the
view
which
followed
that
the
education
of
the
young
ought
to
be
entirely
under
priestly
control
the
priests
being
the
vicars
of
the
pope
even
as
he
the
pope
was
the
vicar
of
the
deity
there
were
some
curious
and
even
amusing
incidents
in
the
course
of
that
now
forgotten
campaign
for
instance
it
was
actually
proposed
to
abolish
the
study
of
the
greek
and
latin
classics
in
france
a
suggestion
which
many
of
the
bishops
vigorously
upheld
though
others
of
a
scholarly
turn
pleaded
plaintively
in
favour
of
horace
and
a
few
others
whose
writings
if
edited
in
a
christian
spirit
might
yet
they
thought
be
allowed
among
young
men
of
proved
morality
with
the
educational
controversy
many
political
matters
soon
became
blended
the
italian
revolutionaries
were
at
that
time
doing
their
utmost
to
frighten
napoleon
iii
into
fulfilment
of
his
early
promises
respecting
the
liberation
of
italy
and
the
vatican
anxious
for
the
maintenance
of
the
old
order
of
things
since
any
change
must
help
on
its
own
fall
made
desperate
efforts
to
prevent
the
interference
of
france
in
italian
affairs
unless
indeed
it
were
for
the
consolidation
of
the
papal
power
even
as
in
recent
times
the
assumptionist
fathers
have
intrigued
for
the
overthrow
of
the
third
republic
so
did
the
société
de
vincent
de
paul
which
nominally
was
a
mere
charitable
organisation
seek
to
turn
the
empire
into
a
priestly
or
in
default
thereof
to
overthrow
it
the
position
of
napoleon
iii
was
the
more
difficult
since
his
own
wife
the
empress
eugénie
acted
as
the
vatican
spy
and
agent
matters
at
last
reached
such
a
pass
that
the
emperor
minister
billault
had
on
the
one
hand
to
prohibit
political
allusions
in
sermons
under
pain
of
fine
and
imprisonment
and
on
the
other
to
break
up
and
scatter
the
intriguing
religious
societies
nevertheless
the
empire
position
remained
a
difficult
one
to
the
very
last
and
napoleon
iii
was
often
sorely
puzzled
how
to
steer
a
safe
course
between
the
claims
of
the
pope
and
the
clergy
and
the
aspirations
of
italy
and
its
to
say
nothing
of
the
views
of
all
those
who
thinking
of
france
alone
by
no
means
approved
of
priestly
power
in
politics
it
is
on
the
state
of
affairs
to
which
i
have
alluded
the
hostility
of
a
part
of
the
french
clergy
to
the
empire
in
its
earlier
years
that
zola
has
based
his
novel
conquest
of
plassans
the
priests
subservient
to
the
vatican
lead
the
town
into
a
course
of
opposition
against
imperial
institutions
and
the
government
then
despatches
thither
an
impecunious
and
unscrupulous
priest
one
abbé
faujas
for
the
purpose
of
winning
it
back
again
such
tactics
were
not
infrequently
employed
at
that
time
whilst
a
part
of
the
clergy
simply
followed
its
own
inclinations
others
venally
took
pay
from
the
empire
to
do
its
dirty
work
as
often
as
not
they
subsequently
betrayed
their
paymaster
using
the
positions
into
which
they
were
thrust
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
personal
ambition
still
for
a
while
these
needy
at
the
ministry
of
public
worship
proved
useful
allies
and
the
empire
was
only
too
ready
to
employ
them
it
will
be
seen
then
that
the
theme
chosen
by
zola
rests
upon
historical
fact
and
it
may
be
taken
that
his
story
embodies
incidents
which
actually
occurred
under
such
conditions
as
those
that
i
have
described
the
of
plassans
may
well
be
read
in
conjunction
with
fortune
of
the
rougons
zola
earlier
work
as
the
scene
in
both
instances
is
the
same
and
certain
personages
such
as
félicité
rougon
and
antoine
macquart
figure
largely
in
both
books
in
the
earlier
volume
we
see
the
effect
of
the
coup
in
the
provinces
almost
every
incident
being
based
upon
historical
fact
for
instance
miette
the
heroine
of
fortune
of
the
rougons
had
a
counterpart
in
madame
ferrier
that
being
the
real
name
of
the
young
woman
who
carrying
the
insurgents
banner
was
hailed
by
them
as
the
of
liberty
on
their
dramatic
march
and
in
like
way
the
tragic
death
of
silvère
linked
to
another
hapless
prisoner
was
founded
by
zola
on
an
incident
that
followed
the
rising
as
recorded
by
an
eyewitness
amidst
all
the
bloodshed
the
rougons
in
zola
narrative
rise
to
fortune
and
power
and
plassans
really
bows
down
before
them
but
time
passes
the
revolt
of
the
clergy
supervenes
by
their
influence
the
town
chooses
a
royalist
marquis
as
deputy
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
conquer
it
once
again
abbé
faujas
by
whom
this
conquest
is
achieved
on
behalf
of
the
empire
is
i
think
a
strongly
conceived
character
perhaps
the
most
real
of
all
the
priests
that
are
scattered
through
zola
books
i
do
not
say
this
because
he
happens
to
be
anything
but
a
good
man
zola
has
sketched
more
than
one
good
priest
in
his
novels
as
for
instance
abbé
rose
in
but
in
this
one
faujas
there
is
more
genuine
flesh
and
blood
than
in
all
the
others
true
his
colleagues
bourrette
and
fenil
are
admirably
suggested
the
bishop
too
an
indolent
prelate
who
surrenders
the
government
of
his
diocese
to
his
and
spends
his
time
in
translating
horace
for
he
is
one
of
the
few
who
favour
the
classics
leaves
on
one
an
impression
of
reality
yet
no
other
priestly
creation
of
zola
pen
can
to
my
thinking
vie
with
the
stern
chaste
authoritative
ambitious
faujas
the
man
who
subdues
plassans
and
who
wrecks
the
home
of
the
mouret
family
with
whom
he
lives
leading
parts
in
the
story
are
assigned
to
mouret
and
his
wife
marthe
both
of
whom
are
extremely
interesting
figures
the
genesis
of
the
former
career
and
fate
is
contained
in
one
of
short
stories
fou
which
he
contributed
to
the
paris
before
he
took
to
book
writing
the
idea
so
skilfully
worked
out
is
that
of
a
man
who
although
perfectly
sane
is
generally
believed
to
be
mad
and
who
by
force
of
being
thus
regarded
does
ultimately
lose
his
wits
in
marthe
his
wife
the
of
a
mad
woman
we
find
the
hereditary
flaw
turning
to
hysteria
in
a
measure
of
a
religious
character
such
as
subsequently
becomes
manifest
in
her
son
serge
the
chief
character
of
mouret
transgression
which
work
proceeds
directly
from
conquest
of
plassans
in
the
latter
book
as
in
fortune
of
the
rougons
zola
skilfully
depicts
all
the
life
of
a
french
provincial
town
such
as
it
was
half
a
century
or
so
ago
and
in
this
respect
he
has
simply
drawn
upon
his
own
recollections
of
aix
where
he
spent
so
many
years
of
his
boyhood
much
that
he
records
might
be
applied
to
such
towns
even
nowadays
for
electric
lighting
and
tramcars
and
and
increased
railway
facilities
have
made
little
change
in
provincial
society
there
are
still
rival
and
and
petty
jealousies
and
vanities
all
at
work
and
if
new
parties
have
succeeded
old
ones
their
intrigues
have
remained
of
much
the
same
description
as
formerly
the
many
provincials
who
in
zola
narrative
gravitate
around
the
chief
characters
are
pleasantly
and
skilfully
diversified
and
seem
very
with
their
foibles
and
and
rivalries
and
ambitions
possibly
the
most
interesting
are
the
paloques
husband
and
wife
whom
envy
hatred
and
all
uncharitableness
incessantly
consume
again
madame
faujas
the
priest
mother
is
a
character
but
perhaps
the
failings
of
her
daughter
olympe
and
of
trouche
olympe
husband
verge
slightly
upon
caricature
as
for
old
rose
the
mourets
servant
though
her
ways
are
very
amusing
and
the
part
she
plays
in
the
persecution
of
her
master
renders
her
an
indispensable
personage
in
the
narrative
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
she
is
virtually
the
same
woman
who
has
done
duty
half
a
dozen
times
in
books
for
instance
as
martine
in
pascal
as
véronique
in
joy
of
life
and
so
forth
it
is
rather
curious
indeed
that
zola
so
skilful
in
portraying
diversity
of
character
and
disposition
among
his
other
personages
should
have
clung
so
pertinaciously
to
one
sole
type
of
an
old
it
is
not
my
purpose
here
to
analyse
in
detail
the
plot
of
conquest
of
plassans
but
having
dealt
at
some
length
with
the
historical
incidents
on
which
the
work
is
based
it
is
as
well
that
i
should
point
out
that
politics
are
not
obtruded
upon
the
reader
in
zola
pages
indeed
the
book
largely
deals
with
quite
another
matter
that
of
priest
in
the
house
showing
as
it
does
how
the
mourets
home
was
wrecked
by
the
combined
action
of
the
faujases
and
the
trouches
in
this
connection
the
dolorous
career
of
the
unhappy
marthe
is
very
vividly
pictured
a
fairly
contented
wife
and
mother
at
the
outset
of
the
story
she
is
won
over
to
religion
by
faujas
whose
purpose
is
to
utilise
her
as
an
instrument
for
the
furtherance
of
his
political
and
social
schemes
but
religion
for
her
becomes
a
mysticism
full
of
unrealisable
yearnings
for
she
expects
to
taste
the
joys
of
heaven
even
upon
earth
carried
away
by
her
religious
fervour
she
soon
neglects
her
home
and
her
husband
it
must
be
admitted
takes
anything
but
the
right
course
to
win
her
back
she
begins
to
loathe
him
and
to
indulge
in
an
insane
passion
for
the
priest
by
whom
she
is
spurned
then
hysteria
masters
her
and
consumption
sets
in
and
between
them
those
fell
diseases
bring
her
to
an
early
grave
there
are
some
finely
conceived
scenes
between
marthe
and
faujas
but
the
climax
only
comes
towards
the
end
of
the
volume
when
mouret
the
husband
who
has
been
driven
mad
and
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
returns
home
and
wreaks
the
most
terrible
vengeance
upon
those
who
have
wronged
him
the
pages
which
deal
with
the
madman
escape
and
his
horrible
revenge
are
certainly
among
the
most
powerful
that
zola
has
ever
written
and
have
been
commended
for
their
effectiveness
by
several
of
his
leading
critics

désirée
clapped
her
hands
she
was
fourteen
years
old
and
big
and
strong
for
her
age
but
she
laughed
like
a
little
girl
of
five
mother
she
cried
at
my
doll
she
showed
her
mother
a
strip
of
rag
out
of
which
she
had
been
trying
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
to
manufacture
a
doll
by
rolling
it
and
tying
it
at
one
end
with
a
piece
of
string
marthe
raised
her
eyes
from
the
stockings
that
she
was
darning
with
as
much
delicacy
of
work
as
though
she
were
embroidering
and
smiled
at
désirée
but
that
only
a
baby
she
said
must
make
a
doll
and
it
must
have
a
dress
you
know
like
a
lady
she
gave
the
child
some
clippings
of
print
stuff
which
she
found
in
her
and
then
again
devoted
all
her
attention
to
her
stockings
they
were
both
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
narrow
terrace
the
girl
on
a
stool
at
her
mother
feet
the
setting
sun
of
a
still
warm
september
evening
cast
its
calm
peaceful
rays
around
them
and
the
garden
below
which
was
already
growing
grey
and
shadowy
was
wrapped
in
perfect
silence
outside
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
in
that
quiet
corner
of
the
town
they
both
worked
on
for
ten
long
minutes
without
speaking
désirée
was
taking
immense
pains
to
make
a
dress
for
her
doll
every
few
moments
marthe
raised
her
head
and
glanced
at
the
child
with
an
expression
in
which
sadness
was
mingled
with
affection
seeing
that
the
girl
task
seemed
too
much
for
her
she
at
last
said
it
to
me
i
will
put
in
the
sleeves
for
you
as
she
took
up
the
doll
two
big
lads
of
seventeen
and
eighteen
came
down
the
steps
they
ran
to
marthe
and
kissed
her
scold
us
mother
cried
octave
gaily
took
serge
to
listen
to
the
band
there
was
such
a
crowd
on
the
cours
sauvaire
thought
you
had
been
kept
in
at
college
his
mother
said
i
should
have
felt
very
uneasy
désirée
now
altogether
indifferent
to
her
doll
had
thrown
her
arms
round
serge
neck
saying
to
him
of
my
birds
has
flown
away
the
blue
one
the
one
you
gave
me
she
was
on
the
point
of
crying
her
mother
who
had
imagined
this
trouble
to
be
forgotten
vainly
tried
to
divert
her
thoughts
by
showing
her
the
doll
the
girl
still
clung
to
her
brother
arm
and
dragged
him
away
with
her
while
repeating
and
let
us
look
for
it
serge
followed
her
with
kindly
complaisance
and
tried
to
console
her
she
led
him
to
a
little
conservatory
in
front
of
which
there
was
a
cage
placed
on
a
stand
and
here
she
told
him
how
the
bird
had
escaped
just
as
she
was
opening
the
door
to
prevent
it
from
fighting
with
a
companion
there
nothing
very
surprising
in
that
cried
octave
who
had
seated
himself
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
is
always
interfering
with
them
trying
to
find
out
how
they
are
made
and
what
it
is
they
have
in
their
throats
that
makes
them
sing
the
other
day
she
was
carrying
them
about
in
her
pockets
the
whole
afternoon
to
keep
them
warm
said
marthe
in
a
tone
of
reproach
tease
the
poor
child
but
désirée
had
not
heard
him
she
was
explaining
to
serge
with
much
detail
how
the
bird
had
flown
away
just
slipped
out
you
see
like
that
and
then
it
flew
over
yonder
and
lighted
on
monsieur
rastoil
big
next
it
flew
off
to
the
at
the
bottom
came
back
again
and
went
right
over
my
head
into
the
big
trees
belonging
to
the
and
i
never
seen
it
since
no
never
since
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
will
come
back
again
serge
ventured
to
say
do
you
think
so
i
think
i
will
put
the
others
into
a
box
and
leave
the
door
of
the
cage
open
all
night
octave
could
not
restrain
his
laughter
but
marthe
called
to
désirée
and
look
here
come
and
look
here
then
she
gave
her
the
doll
it
was
a
magnificent
one
now
it
had
a
stiff
dress
a
head
made
of
a
pad
of
calico
and
arms
of
list
sewn
on
at
the
shoulders
désirée
eyes
lighted
up
with
sudden
joy
she
sat
down
again
upon
the
stool
and
forgetting
all
about
the
bird
began
to
kiss
the
doll
and
dandle
it
in
her
arms
with
childish
delight
serge
had
gone
to
lean
upon
the
balustrade
near
his
brother
and
marthe
had
resumed
her
darning
so
the
band
has
been
playing
has
it
she
asked
plays
every
thursday
octave
replied
ought
to
have
come
to
hear
it
mother
all
the
town
was
there
the
rastoil
girls
madame
de
condamin
monsieur
paloque
the
mayor
wife
and
daughter
why
you
come
too
marthe
did
not
raise
her
eyes
but
softly
replied
as
she
finished
darning
a
hole
know
very
well
my
dears
that
i
do
care
about
going
out
i
am
quite
contented
here
and
then
it
is
necessary
that
someone
should
stay
with
désirée
octave
opened
his
lips
to
reply
but
he
glanced
at
his
sister
and
kept
silent
he
remained
where
he
was
whistling
softly
and
raising
his
eyes
now
towards
the
trees
of
the
noisy
with
the
twittering
of
the
sparrows
which
were
preparing
to
retire
for
the
night
and
now
towards
monsieur
rastoil
behind
which
the
sun
was
setting
serge
had
taken
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
was
reading
it
attentively
soft
silence
brooded
over
the
terrace
as
it
lay
there
in
the
yellow
light
that
was
gradually
growing
fainter
marthe
continued
darning
ever
and
anon
glancing
at
her
three
children
in
the
peaceful
quiet
of
the
evening
seems
to
be
late
she
said
after
a
time
is
nearly
six
and
your
father
has
come
home
yet
i
think
he
must
have
gone
to
les
tulettes
then
no
wonder
he
late
exclaimed
octave
peasants
at
les
tulettes
are
never
in
a
hurry
to
let
him
go
when
once
they
get
hold
of
him
has
he
gone
there
to
buy
some
wine
do
know
marthe
replied
is
fond
you
know
of
talking
to
me
about
his
business
then
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
in
the
the
window
of
which
opened
on
to
the
terrace
old
rose
had
just
begun
to
lay
the
table
with
much
angry
clattering
of
crockery
and
plate
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
banged
the
chairs
about
while
breaking
into
snatches
of
grumbling
and
growling
at
last
she
went
to
the
street
door
and
craning
out
her
head
reconnoitred
the
square
in
front
of
the
after
some
minutes
waiting
she
came
to
the
and
cried
mouret
is
coming
home
to
dinner
then
rose
wait
a
little
longer
marthe
replied
quietly
is
getting
burned
to
cinders
there
no
sense
in
it
all
when
master
goes
off
on
those
rounds
he
ought
to
give
us
notice
well
it
all
the
same
to
me
but
your
dinner
will
be
quite
uneatable
do
you
really
think
so
rose
asked
a
quiet
voice
just
behind
her
will
eat
it
notwithstanding
it
was
mouret
who
had
just
arrived
rose
turned
round
looked
her
master
in
the
face
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
some
angry
exclamation
but
at
the
sight
of
his
unruffled
countenance
in
which
twinkled
an
expression
of
merry
banter
she
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
and
so
she
retired
mouret
made
his
way
to
the
terrace
where
he
paced
about
without
sitting
down
he
just
tapped
désirée
lightly
on
the
cheek
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
the
girl
greeted
him
with
a
responsive
smile
marthe
raised
her
eyes
and
when
she
had
glanced
at
her
husband
she
began
to
fold
up
her
work
you
tired
asked
octave
looking
at
his
father
boots
which
were
white
with
dust
indeed
a
little
mouret
replied
without
however
saying
anything
more
about
the
long
journey
which
he
had
just
made
on
foot
then
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
he
caught
sight
of
a
spade
and
a
rake
which
the
children
had
forgotten
there
are
the
tools
not
put
away
he
cried
have
spoken
about
it
a
hundred
times
if
it
should
come
on
to
rain
they
would
be
completely
rusted
and
spoilt
he
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
stepped
down
into
the
garden
picked
up
the
spade
and
rake
himself
and
put
them
carefully
away
inside
the
little
conservatory
as
he
came
up
to
the
terrace
again
his
eyes
searched
every
corner
of
the
walks
to
see
if
things
were
tidy
there
you
learning
your
lessons
he
asked
as
he
passed
serge
who
was
still
poring
over
his
book
father
the
boy
replied
is
a
book
that
abbé
bourrette
has
lent
me
it
is
an
account
of
the
missions
in
china
mouret
stopped
short
in
front
of
his
wife
the
way
said
he
anyone
been
here
no
one
my
dear
replied
marthe
with
an
appearance
of
surprise
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
further
but
appeared
to
change
his
mind
and
continued
pacing
up
and
down
in
silence
then
going
to
the
steps
he
cried
out
rose
what
about
this
dinner
of
yours
which
is
getting
burnt
to
cinders
indeed
there
is
nothing
ready
for
you
now
shouted
the
cook
in
an
angry
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
passage
is
cold
you
will
have
to
wait
sir
mouret
smiled
in
silence
and
winked
with
his
left
eye
as
he
glanced
at
his
wife
and
children
he
seemed
to
be
very
much
amused
by
rose
anger
then
he
occupied
himself
in
examining
his
is
surprising
what
splendid
pears
monsieur
rastoil
has
got
this
year
he
remarked
marthe
who
had
appeared
a
little
uneasy
for
the
last
few
minutes
seemed
as
though
she
wanted
to
say
something
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
and
timidly
inquired
you
expecting
someone
my
dear
and
no
he
replied
beginning
to
pace
the
terrace
again
you
have
let
the
second
floor
indeed
i
have
let
it
then
as
the
silence
became
a
little
embarrassing
he
added
in
his
quiet
way
morning
before
starting
for
les
tulettes
i
went
up
to
see
abbé
bourrette
he
was
very
pressing
and
so
i
agreed
to
his
proposal
i
know
it
wo
please
you
but
if
you
will
only
think
the
matter
over
for
a
little
you
will
see
that
you
are
wrong
my
dear
the
second
floor
was
of
no
use
to
us
and
it
was
only
going
to
ruin
the
fruit
that
we
store
in
the
rooms
there
brings
on
dampness
which
makes
the
paper
fall
from
the
walls
by
the
way
now
that
i
think
of
it
forget
to
remove
the
fruit
the
first
thing
our
tenant
may
arrive
at
any
moment
were
so
free
and
comfortable
all
alone
in
our
own
house
marthe
ventured
to
say
in
a
low
tone
well
replied
mouret
sha
find
a
priest
in
our
way
he
will
keep
to
himself
and
we
shall
keep
to
ourselves
those
gentlemen
hide
themselves
when
they
want
to
swallow
even
a
glass
of
water
you
know
that
i
not
very
partial
to
them
myself
a
set
of
lazybones
for
the
most
part
and
yet
what
chiefly
decided
me
to
let
the
floor
was
that
i
had
found
a
priest
for
a
tenant
one
is
quite
sure
of
one
money
with
them
and
they
are
so
quiet
that
one
even
hear
them
go
in
and
out
marthe
still
appeared
distressed
she
looked
round
her
at
the
happy
home
basking
in
the
sun
farewell
at
the
garden
which
was
now
growing
greyer
with
shadows
and
at
her
three
children
and
she
thought
of
all
the
happiness
which
this
little
spot
held
for
her
do
you
know
anything
about
this
priest
asked
but
abbé
bourrette
has
taken
the
floor
in
his
own
name
and
that
is
quite
sufficient
abbé
bourrette
is
an
honourable
man
i
know
that
our
tenant
is
called
faujas
abbé
faujas
and
that
he
comes
from
the
diocese
of
besançon
he
did
get
on
very
well
with
his
vicar
there
and
so
he
has
been
appointed
curate
here
at
perhaps
he
knows
our
bishop
monseigneur
rousselot
but
all
this
is
no
business
of
ours
you
know
and
it
is
to
abbé
bourrette
that
i
am
trusting
in
the
whole
matter
marthe
however
did
not
seem
to
share
her
husband
confidence
but
continued
to
stand
out
against
him
a
thing
which
seldom
happened
are
right
she
said
after
a
moment
silence
bourrette
is
a
worthy
man
but
i
recollect
that
when
he
came
to
look
at
the
rooms
he
told
me
that
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
person
on
whose
behalf
he
was
commissioned
to
rent
them
it
was
one
of
those
commissions
which
are
undertaken
by
priests
in
one
town
for
those
in
another
i
really
think
that
you
ought
to
write
to
besançon
and
make
some
inquiries
as
to
what
sort
of
a
person
it
is
that
you
are
about
to
introduce
into
your
house
mouret
was
anxious
to
avoid
losing
his
temper
he
smiled
complacently
it
is
the
devil
anyhow
why
you
trembling
all
over
i
did
think
you
were
so
superstitious
you
surely
do
believe
that
priests
bring
ill
luck
as
folks
say
neither
of
course
do
they
bring
good
luck
they
are
just
like
other
men
but
when
we
get
this
abbé
here
you
see
if
i
afraid
of
his
cassock
i
not
superstitious
you
know
that
quite
well
replied
marthe
only
feel
unhappy
about
it
that
all
he
took
his
stand
in
front
of
her
and
interrupted
her
with
a
sharp
motion
of
his
hand
there
that
will
do
said
he
have
let
the
rooms
do
let
us
say
anything
more
about
the
matter
then
in
the
bantering
tones
of
a
who
thinks
he
has
done
a
good
stroke
of
business
he
added
any
rate
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
that
i
am
to
get
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
rent
and
we
shall
have
those
additional
hundred
and
fifty
francs
to
spend
on
the
house
every
year
marthe
bent
her
head
and
made
no
further
protestations
except
by
vaguely
swinging
her
hands
and
gently
closing
her
eyes
as
though
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
tears
which
were
already
swelling
beneath
her
eyelids
then
she
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
her
children
who
had
not
appeared
to
hear
anything
of
her
discussion
with
their
father
they
were
indeed
accustomed
to
scenes
of
this
sort
in
which
mouret
with
his
bantering
nature
delighted
to
indulge
can
come
in
now
if
you
would
like
something
to
eat
said
rose
in
her
crabby
voice
as
she
came
to
the
steps
that
right
come
along
children
to
your
soup
cried
mouret
gaily
without
appearing
to
retain
any
trace
of
temper
the
whole
family
rose
but
désirée
grief
seemed
to
revive
at
the
sight
of
everyone
stirring
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
stammered
papa
one
of
my
birds
has
flown
away
of
your
birds
my
dear
well
we
catch
it
again
then
he
began
to
caress
and
fondle
her
but
she
insisted
that
he
also
should
go
and
look
at
the
cage
when
he
brought
her
back
again
marthe
and
her
two
sons
were
already
in
the
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
streaming
in
through
the
window
lighted
up
the
porcelain
plates
the
children
plated
mugs
and
the
white
cloth
the
room
was
warm
and
peaceful
with
its
green
background
of
garden
but
just
as
marthe
upon
whom
the
tranquillity
of
the
scene
had
had
a
soothing
effect
was
smilingly
removing
the
cover
from
the
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
passage
then
rose
rushed
into
the
room
with
a
scared
look
and
stammered
faujas
has
come
ii
an
expression
of
annoyance
passed
over
mouret
face
he
had
not
expected
his
tenant
till
the
following
morning
at
the
earliest
he
was
just
rising
hastily
from
his
seat
when
abbé
faujas
himself
appeared
at
the
door
he
was
a
tall
big
man
with
a
square
face
broad
features
and
a
cadaverous
complexion
behind
him
in
the
shadow
stood
an
elderly
woman
who
bore
an
astonishing
resemblance
to
him
only
that
she
was
of
smaller
build
and
wore
a
less
refined
expression
when
they
saw
the
table
laid
for
a
meal
they
both
hesitated
and
stepped
back
discreetly
though
without
going
away
the
priest
tall
black
figure
contrasted
mournfully
with
the
cheerfulness
of
the
whitewashed
walls
must
ask
your
pardon
for
disturbing
you
he
said
to
mouret
have
just
left
abbé
bourrette
he
no
doubt
gave
you
notice
of
our
coming
at
all
mouret
exclaimed
abbé
never
behaves
like
other
people
he
always
seems
as
though
he
had
just
come
down
from
paradise
only
this
morning
sir
he
told
me
that
you
would
not
be
here
for
another
couple
of
days
well
we
must
put
you
in
possession
of
your
rooms
all
the
same
abbé
faujas
apologised
he
spoke
in
a
deep
voice
which
fell
very
softly
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
he
was
extremely
distressed
said
he
to
have
arrived
at
such
a
moment
and
when
he
had
expressed
his
regret
in
a
very
few
words
he
turned
round
to
pay
the
porter
who
had
brought
his
trunk
his
large
hands
drew
from
the
folds
of
his
cassock
a
purse
of
which
only
the
steel
rings
could
be
seen
keeping
his
head
bent
he
cautiously
fumbled
in
it
for
a
moment
then
without
anyone
having
seen
the
piece
of
money
which
he
had
received
the
porter
went
away
and
the
priest
resumed
in
his
refined
way
beg
you
sir
sit
down
again
your
servant
will
show
us
the
rooms
and
will
help
me
to
carry
this
as
he
spoke
he
stooped
to
grasp
one
of
the
handles
of
his
trunk
it
was
a
small
wooden
trunk
bound
at
the
edges
with
iron
bands
and
one
of
its
sides
seemed
to
have
been
repaired
with
a
of
deal
mouret
looked
surprised
and
his
eyes
wandered
off
in
search
of
other
luggage
but
he
could
see
nothing
excepting
a
big
basket
which
the
elderly
lady
carried
with
both
hands
holding
it
in
front
of
her
and
despite
her
fatigue
obstinately
determined
not
to
put
it
down
from
underneath
the
lid
which
was
a
little
raised
there
peeped
amongst
some
bundles
of
linen
the
end
of
a
comb
wrapped
in
paper
and
the
neck
of
a
clumsily
corked
bottle
do
trouble
yourself
with
that
said
mouret
just
touching
the
trunk
with
his
foot
ca
be
very
heavy
and
rose
will
be
able
to
carry
it
up
by
herself
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
secret
contempt
which
oozed
out
from
his
words
the
elderly
lady
gave
him
a
keen
glance
with
her
black
eyes
and
then
let
her
gaze
again
fall
upon
the
and
the
table
which
she
had
been
examining
ever
since
her
arrival
she
kept
her
lips
tightly
compressed
while
her
eyes
strayed
from
one
object
to
another
she
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
abbé
faujas
consented
to
leave
his
trunk
where
it
was
in
the
yellow
rays
of
the
sunlight
which
streamed
in
from
the
garden
his
threadbare
cassock
looked
quite
ruddy
it
was
darned
at
the
edges
and
though
it
was
scrupulously
clean
it
seemed
so
sadly
thin
and
wretched
that
marthe
who
had
hitherto
remained
seated
with
a
sort
of
uneasy
reserve
now
in
her
turn
rose
from
her
seat
the
abbé
who
had
merely
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
her
and
had
then
quickly
turned
his
eyes
elsewhere
saw
her
leave
her
chair
although
he
did
not
appear
to
be
watching
her
beg
you
he
repeated
not
disturb
yourselves
we
should
be
extremely
distressed
to
interfere
with
your
dinner
well
said
mouret
who
was
hungry
shall
show
you
up
tell
her
to
get
you
anything
you
want
and
make
yourselves
at
home
abbé
faujas
bowed
and
was
making
his
way
to
the
staircase
when
marthe
stepped
up
to
her
husband
and
whispered
my
dear
you
have
forgotten
what
he
asked
seeing
her
hesitate
is
the
fruit
you
know
bother
it
all
so
there
is
he
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
and
as
abbé
faujas
stepped
back
and
glanced
at
him
questioningly
he
added
am
extremely
vexed
sir
father
bourrette
is
a
very
worthy
man
but
it
is
a
little
unfortunate
that
you
commissioned
him
to
attend
to
your
business
he
has
got
the
least
bit
of
a
head
if
we
had
only
known
of
your
coming
we
should
have
had
everything
ready
but
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
clear
the
whole
place
out
for
you
we
have
been
using
the
rooms
you
see
we
have
stowed
all
our
crop
of
fruit
figs
apples
and
raisins
away
on
the
floors
upstairs
the
priest
listened
with
a
surprise
which
all
his
politeness
did
not
enable
him
to
hide
it
wo
take
us
long
mouret
continued
you
do
mind
waiting
for
ten
minutes
rose
will
get
the
rooms
cleared
for
you
an
anxious
expression
appeared
on
the
priest
cadaverous
face
rooms
are
furnished
are
they
not
he
asked
at
all
there
is
a
bit
of
furniture
in
them
we
have
never
occupied
them
thereupon
the
abbé
lost
his
and
his
grey
eyes
flashed
as
he
exclaimed
with
suppressed
indignation
i
gave
distinct
instructions
in
my
letter
that
furnished
rooms
were
to
be
taken
i
could
scarcely
bring
my
furniture
along
with
me
in
my
trunk
that
just
fits
in
with
what
i
have
been
saying
cried
mouret
in
a
louder
voice
way
that
bourrette
goes
on
is
quite
incredible
he
certainly
saw
the
apples
when
he
came
to
look
at
the
rooms
sir
for
he
took
up
one
of
them
and
remarked
that
he
had
rarely
seen
such
fine
fruit
he
said
that
everything
seemed
quite
suitable
that
the
rooms
were
all
that
was
necessary
and
he
took
them
abbé
faujas
was
no
longer
listening
to
mouret
his
cheeks
were
flushed
with
anger
he
turned
round
and
stammered
in
a
broken
voice
you
hear
mother
there
is
no
furniture
the
old
lady
with
her
thin
black
shawl
drawn
tightly
round
her
had
just
been
inspecting
the
stepping
furtively
hither
and
thither
but
without
once
putting
down
her
basket
she
had
gone
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
had
scrutinised
the
four
walls
there
and
then
standing
on
the
steps
that
overlooked
the
terrace
she
had
taken
in
all
the
garden
at
one
long
searching
glance
but
it
was
the
that
seemed
more
especially
to
interest
her
and
she
was
now
again
standing
in
front
of
the
table
laid
for
dinner
watching
the
steam
of
the
soup
rise
when
her
son
repeated
you
hear
mother
we
shall
have
to
go
to
the
hotel
she
raised
her
head
without
making
any
reply
but
the
expression
of
her
whole
face
seemed
to
indicate
a
settled
determination
to
remain
in
that
house
with
whose
every
corner
she
had
already
made
herself
acquainted
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
almost
imperceptibly
and
again
her
wandering
eyes
strayed
from
the
kitchen
to
the
garden
and
then
from
the
garden
to
the
mouret
however
was
growing
impatient
as
he
saw
that
neither
the
mother
nor
her
son
seemed
to
make
up
their
minds
to
leave
the
place
he
said
have
no
beds
unfortunately
true
there
is
in
the
loft
a
which
perhaps
at
a
pinch
madame
might
make
do
until
but
i
really
do
know
how
monsieur
is
to
manage
to
sleep
then
at
last
madame
faujas
opened
her
lips
she
spoke
in
a
curt
and
somewhat
hoarse
voice
son
will
take
the
a
mattress
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
will
be
quite
sufficient
for
me
the
abbé
signified
his
approval
of
this
arrangement
by
a
nod
mouret
was
going
to
protest
and
try
to
think
of
some
other
plan
but
seeing
the
satisfied
appearance
of
his
new
tenants
he
kept
silence
and
merely
exchanged
a
glance
of
astonishment
with
his
wife
it
will
be
light
he
said
with
his
touch
of
banter
you
will
be
able
to
furnish
as
you
like
rose
will
go
up
and
clear
away
the
fruit
and
make
the
beds
will
you
wait
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
terrace
come
children
take
a
couple
of
chairs
out
since
the
arrival
of
the
priest
and
his
mother
the
young
people
had
remained
quietly
seated
at
the
table
curiously
scrutinising
the
the
abbé
had
not
appeared
to
notice
them
but
madame
faujas
had
stopped
for
a
moment
before
each
of
them
and
stared
them
keenly
in
the
face
as
though
she
were
trying
to
pry
into
their
young
heads
as
they
heard
their
father
they
all
three
hastily
rose
and
took
some
chairs
out
the
old
lady
did
not
sit
down
and
when
mouret
losing
sight
of
her
turned
round
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
her
he
saw
her
standing
before
a
window
of
the
which
was
ajar
she
craned
out
her
neck
and
completed
her
inspection
with
all
the
calm
deliberation
of
a
person
who
is
examining
some
property
for
sale
just
as
rose
took
up
the
little
trunk
however
she
went
back
into
the
passage
and
said
quietly
will
go
up
and
help
you
then
she
went
upstairs
after
the
servant
the
priest
did
not
even
turn
his
head
he
was
smiling
at
the
three
young
people
who
still
stood
in
front
of
him
in
spite
of
the
hardness
of
his
brow
and
the
stern
lines
about
his
mouth
his
face
was
capable
of
expressing
great
gentleness
when
such
was
his
desire
this
the
whole
of
your
family
madame
he
asked
marthe
who
had
just
come
up
to
him
sir
she
replied
feeling
a
little
confused
beneath
the
clear
gaze
which
he
turned
upon
her
looking
again
at
her
children
he
continued
got
two
big
lads
there
who
will
soon
be
men
have
you
finished
your
studies
yet
my
boy
it
was
to
serge
that
he
addressed
this
question
mouret
interrupted
the
lad
as
he
was
going
to
reply
he
has
finished
said
the
father
he
is
the
younger
of
the
two
when
i
say
that
he
has
finished
i
mean
that
he
has
taken
his
bachelor
degree
for
he
is
staying
on
at
college
for
another
year
to
go
through
a
course
of
philosophy
he
is
the
clever
one
of
the
family
his
brother
the
elder
that
great
booby
there
is
up
to
much
he
has
been
plucked
twice
already
but
he
still
goes
on
idling
his
time
away
and
larking
about
octave
listened
to
his
father
reproaches
with
a
smile
while
serge
bent
his
head
beneath
his
praises
faujas
seemed
to
be
studying
them
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
going
up
to
désirée
and
putting
on
an
expression
of
gentle
tenderness
he
said
to
her
you
allow
me
mademoiselle
to
be
your
friend
she
made
no
reply
but
half
afraid
hastened
to
hide
her
face
against
her
mother
shoulder
the
latter
instead
of
making
her
turn
round
again
pressed
her
more
closely
to
her
clasping
an
arm
around
her
waist
her
she
said
with
a
touch
of
sadness
has
a
strong
head
she
has
remained
quite
childish
she
is
an
innocent
we
do
not
trouble
her
by
attempting
to
teach
her
she
is
fourteen
years
old
now
and
as
yet
she
has
only
learned
to
love
animals
désirée
confidence
returned
to
her
with
her
mother
caresses
and
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
smiled
then
she
boldly
said
to
the
priest
should
like
you
very
much
to
be
my
friend
but
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
never
hurt
the
flies
will
you
and
then
as
every
one
about
her
began
to
smile
she
added
gravely
crushes
them
the
poor
flies
it
is
very
wicked
of
him
abbé
faujas
sat
down
he
seemed
very
much
tired
he
yielded
for
a
moment
or
two
to
the
cool
quietness
of
the
terrace
glancing
slowly
over
the
garden
and
the
neighbouring
trees
the
perfect
calmness
and
solitude
of
this
quiet
corner
of
the
little
town
seemed
somewhat
to
surprise
him
is
very
pleasant
here
he
murmured
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
seemed
lost
in
reverie
he
started
slightly
as
mouret
said
to
him
with
a
laugh
you
will
allow
us
sir
we
will
now
go
back
to
our
dinner
and
then
catching
a
glance
from
his
wife
mouret
added
must
sit
down
with
us
and
have
a
plate
of
soup
it
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
having
to
go
to
the
hotel
to
dine
do
make
any
difficulty
i
beg
am
extremely
obliged
to
you
but
we
really
do
require
anything
the
abbé
replied
in
tones
of
extreme
politeness
which
allowed
of
no
repetition
of
the
invitation
the
mourets
then
returned
to
the
and
seated
themselves
round
the
table
marthe
served
the
soup
and
there
was
soon
a
cheerful
clatter
of
spoons
the
young
people
chattered
merrily
and
désirée
broke
into
a
peal
of
ringing
laughter
as
she
listened
to
a
story
which
her
father
who
was
now
in
high
glee
at
having
at
last
got
to
his
dinner
was
telling
in
the
meantime
abbé
faujas
whom
they
had
quite
forgotten
remained
motionless
upon
the
terrace
facing
the
setting
sun
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
he
seemed
to
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
behind
him
just
as
the
sun
was
disappearing
he
took
off
his
hat
as
if
overcome
by
the
heat
marthe
who
was
sitting
with
her
face
to
the
window
could
see
his
big
bare
head
with
its
short
hair
that
was
already
silvering
about
the
temples
a
last
red
ray
lighting
up
that
stern
head
on
which
the
tonsure
lay
like
a
cicatrised
wound
from
the
blow
of
a
club
then
the
ray
faded
away
and
the
priest
now
wrapped
in
shadow
seemed
nothing
more
than
a
black
silhouette
against
the
ashy
grey
of
the
gloaming
not
wishing
to
summon
rose
marthe
herself
went
to
get
a
lamp
and
brought
in
the
first
dish
as
she
was
returning
from
the
kitchen
she
met
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
a
woman
whom
she
did
not
at
first
recognise
it
was
madame
faujas
she
had
put
on
a
cotton
cap
and
looked
like
a
servant
in
her
common
print
gown
with
a
yellow
kerchief
crossed
over
her
breast
and
knotted
behind
her
waist
her
wrists
were
bare
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
with
the
work
she
had
been
doing
and
her
heavy
laced
boots
clattered
on
the
flooring
of
the
passage
you
got
all
put
right
now
have
you
madame
marthe
asked
with
a
smile
yes
it
was
a
mere
trifle
and
was
done
directly
madame
faujas
replied
she
went
down
the
steps
that
led
to
the
terrace
and
called
in
a
gentler
tone
my
child
will
you
come
upstairs
now
everything
is
quite
ready
she
was
obliged
to
go
and
lay
her
hand
upon
her
son
shoulder
to
awaken
him
from
his
reverie
the
air
was
growing
cool
and
the
abbé
shivered
as
he
got
up
and
followed
his
mother
in
silence
as
he
passed
before
the
door
of
the
which
was
all
bright
with
the
cheerful
glow
of
the
lamp
and
merry
with
the
chatter
of
the
young
folks
he
peeped
in
and
said
in
his
flexible
voice
me
thank
you
again
and
beg
you
to
excuse
us
for
having
so
disturbed
you
we
are
very
sorry
no
cried
mouret
is
we
who
are
sorry
and
distressed
at
not
being
able
to
offer
you
better
accommodation
for
the
night
the
priest
bowed
and
marthe
again
met
that
clear
gaze
of
his
that
eagle
glance
which
had
affected
her
before
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
which
were
generally
of
a
melancholy
grey
flames
seemed
to
gleam
at
times
like
lamps
carried
behind
the
windows
of
slumbering
houses
priest
not
at
all
shamefaced
mouret
remarked
jestingly
when
the
mother
and
son
had
retired
do
think
they
are
very
well
off
marthe
replied
at
any
rate
he
is
carrying
peru
about
with
him
in
that
box
of
his
mouret
exclaimed
it
light
enough
why
i
could
have
raised
it
with
the
tip
of
my
little
finger
but
he
was
interrupted
in
his
flow
of
chatter
by
rose
who
had
just
come
running
down
the
stairs
to
relate
the
extraordinary
things
she
had
witnessed
she
is
a
wonderful
creature
indeed
she
cried
posting
herself
in
front
of
the
table
at
which
the
family
were
eating
at
least
but
she
does
show
it
at
all
and
she
bustles
about
and
works
like
a
horse
she
help
you
to
remove
the
fruit
mouret
asked
with
some
curiosity
indeed
she
did
sir
she
carried
it
away
in
her
apron
in
loads
heavy
enough
to
burst
it
i
kept
saying
to
myself
the
apron
will
certainly
go
this
time
but
it
did
it
is
made
of
good
strong
material
the
same
kind
of
material
as
i
wear
myself
we
made
at
least
ten
journeys
backwards
and
forwards
and
i
felt
as
though
my
arms
would
fall
off
but
she
only
grumbled
and
complained
that
we
were
getting
on
very
slowly
i
really
believe
begging
your
pardon
for
mentioning
it
that
i
heard
her
swear
mouret
appeared
to
be
greatly
amused
the
beds
he
asked
beds
she
made
them
too
it
was
quite
a
sight
to
see
her
turn
the
mattress
over
it
seemed
to
weigh
nothing
i
can
tell
you
she
just
took
hold
of
it
at
one
end
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
as
though
it
had
been
a
feather
and
yet
she
was
very
careful
and
particular
with
it
all
she
tucked
in
the
as
carefully
as
though
she
were
preparing
a
baby
cradle
she
could
have
laid
the
sheets
with
greater
devotion
if
the
infant
jesus
himself
had
been
going
to
sleep
there
she
put
three
out
of
the
four
blankets
upon
the
and
it
was
just
the
same
with
the
pillows
she
kept
none
for
herself
but
gave
both
to
her
son
is
going
to
sleep
on
the
floor
then
a
corner
just
like
a
dog
she
threw
a
mattress
on
the
floor
of
the
other
room
and
said
that
she
sleep
there
more
soundly
than
if
she
were
in
paradise
i
could
persuade
her
to
do
anything
to
make
herself
more
comfortable
she
says
that
she
is
never
cold
and
that
her
head
is
much
too
hard
to
make
her
at
all
afraid
of
lying
on
the
floor
i
have
taken
them
some
sugar
and
some
water
as
madame
told
me
oh
they
really
are
the
strangest
people
then
rose
brought
in
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
that
evening
the
mourets
lingered
over
their
meal
they
discussed
the
new
tenants
at
great
length
in
their
life
which
went
on
with
all
the
even
regularity
of
the
arrival
of
these
two
strangers
was
a
very
exciting
event
they
talked
about
it
as
they
would
have
done
of
some
catastrophe
in
the
neighbourhood
going
into
all
that
minuteness
of
detail
which
helps
one
to
while
away
long
nights
in
the
country
mouret
was
especially
fond
of
the
chattering
gossip
of
a
little
provincial
town
during
dessert
as
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
the
cool
he
repeated
for
the
tenth
time
with
the
air
of
a
happy
man
certainly
is
a
very
handsome
present
that
besançon
has
made
to
plassans
did
you
notice
the
back
of
his
cassock
when
he
turned
round
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
he
is
much
run
after
by
the
pious
folks
here
he
is
too
seedy
and
threadbare
and
the
pious
folks
like
priests
has
a
very
gentle
voice
said
marthe
indulgently
when
he
is
angry
at
any
rate
mouret
replied
you
hear
him
when
he
burst
out
on
finding
that
the
rooms
were
not
furnished
he
a
stern
man
i
be
bound
not
one
of
the
sort
i
should
think
to
go
lounging
in
i
shall
be
very
curious
to
see
how
he
sets
about
his
furnishing
but
as
long
as
he
pays
me
i
do
much
mind
anything
else
if
he
does
i
shall
apply
to
abbé
bourrette
it
was
with
him
that
i
made
the
bargain
the
mourets
were
not
a
devout
family
the
children
themselves
made
fun
of
the
abbé
and
his
mother
octave
burlesqued
the
old
lady
way
of
craning
out
her
neck
to
see
to
the
end
of
the
rooms
a
performance
which
made
désirée
laugh
after
a
time
however
serge
who
was
of
a
more
serious
turn
of
mind
stood
up
for
poor
people
as
a
rule
precisely
at
ten
if
he
was
not
playing
at
piquet
mouret
took
up
his
candlestick
and
went
off
to
bed
but
that
evening
when
eleven
struck
he
was
not
yet
feeling
drowsy
désirée
had
fallen
asleep
with
her
head
lying
on
marthe
knees
the
two
lads
had
gone
up
to
their
room
and
mouret
left
alone
with
his
wife
still
went
on
chattering
old
do
you
suppose
he
is
he
suddenly
asked
replied
marthe
who
was
now
beginning
to
feel
very
sleepy
why
the
abbé
of
course
between
forty
and
eh
a
fine
strapping
fellow
it
a
pity
for
him
to
wear
a
cassock
he
would
have
made
a
splendid
carbineer
then
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
vented
aloud
the
reflections
which
were
exercising
his
mind
arrived
by
the
quarter
to
seven
train
they
can
only
have
just
had
time
to
call
on
abbé
bourrette
before
coming
here
i
wager
that
they
have
dined
that
is
quite
clear
we
should
certainly
have
seen
them
if
they
had
gone
out
to
the
hotel
ah
now
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
where
they
can
have
had
anything
to
eat
rose
had
been
lingering
about
the
for
the
last
few
moments
waiting
for
her
master
and
mistress
to
go
to
bed
in
order
that
she
might
be
at
liberty
to
fasten
the
doors
and
windows
know
where
they
had
something
to
eat
she
said
and
as
mouret
turned
briskly
towards
her
she
added
i
had
gone
upstairs
again
to
see
if
there
was
anything
they
wanted
as
i
heard
no
sound
i
venture
to
knock
at
the
door
but
i
looked
through
the
that
was
very
improper
of
you
very
improper
marthe
interrupted
severely
know
very
well
rose
that
i
do
approve
of
anything
of
that
kind
her
alone
and
let
her
go
on
cried
mouret
who
under
other
circumstances
would
have
been
very
angry
with
the
inquisitive
woman
peeped
through
the
did
you
sir
i
thought
it
was
the
best
plan
so
what
were
they
doing
sir
they
were
eating
i
saw
them
sitting
on
one
corner
of
the
and
eating
the
old
lady
had
spread
out
a
napkin
every
time
that
they
helped
themselves
to
some
wine
they
corked
the
bottle
again
and
laid
it
down
against
the
pillow
what
were
they
eating
could
quite
tell
sir
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
remains
of
some
pastry
wrapped
up
in
a
newspaper
they
had
some
apples
as
well
little
apples
that
looked
good
for
nothing
were
talking
i
suppose
did
you
hear
what
they
said
sir
they
were
not
talking
i
stayed
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
watching
them
but
they
never
said
anything
they
were
much
too
busy
eating
marthe
now
rose
woke
désirée
and
made
as
though
she
were
going
off
to
bed
her
husband
curiosity
vexed
her
he
too
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
go
off
upstairs
while
old
rose
who
was
a
pious
creature
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
poor
dear
man
must
have
been
frightfully
hungry
his
mother
handed
him
the
biggest
pieces
and
watched
him
swallow
them
with
delight
and
now
he
sleep
in
some
nice
white
sheets
unless
indeed
the
smell
of
the
fruit
keeps
him
awake
it
is
a
pleasant
smell
to
have
in
one
bedroom
that
sour
odour
of
apples
and
pears
and
there
is
a
bit
of
furniture
in
the
whole
room
nothing
but
the
bed
in
the
corner
if
i
were
he
i
should
feel
quite
frightened
and
i
should
keep
the
light
burning
all
night
mouret
had
taken
up
his
candlestick
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
rose
and
summed
up
the
events
of
the
evening
like
a
genuine
who
has
met
with
something
unusual
is
extraordinary
then
he
joined
his
wife
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
she
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
while
he
still
continued
listening
to
the
slightest
sounds
that
proceeded
from
the
upper
floor
the
abbé
room
was
immediately
over
his
own
he
heard
the
window
of
it
being
gently
opened
and
this
greatly
excited
his
curiosity
he
raised
his
head
from
his
pillow
and
strenuously
struggled
against
his
increasing
drowsiness
in
his
anxiety
to
find
out
how
long
the
abbé
would
remain
at
the
window
but
sleep
was
too
strong
for
him
and
he
was
snoring
noisily
before
he
had
been
able
to
detect
the
grating
sound
which
the
made
when
it
was
closed
up
above
abbé
faujas
was
gazing
out
of
his
window
into
the
black
night
he
lingered
there
for
a
long
time
glad
to
find
himself
at
last
alone
absorbed
in
those
thoughts
which
gave
his
brow
such
an
expression
of
sternness
underneath
him
he
was
conscious
of
the
tranquil
slumber
of
the
family
whose
home
he
had
been
sharing
for
the
last
few
hours
the
calm
easy
breathing
of
the
children
and
their
mother
marthe
and
the
heavy
regular
respiration
of
mouret
there
was
a
touch
of
scorn
in
the
way
in
which
the
priest
stretched
out
his
muscular
neck
as
he
raised
his
head
to
gaze
upon
the
town
that
lay
slumbering
in
the
distance
the
tall
trees
in
the
garden
of
the
formed
a
mass
of
gloomy
darkness
and
monsieur
thrust
up
scraggy
twisted
branches
while
further
away
there
was
but
a
sea
of
black
shadow
a
blank
nothingness
whence
not
a
sound
proceeded
the
town
lay
as
tranquilly
asleep
as
an
infant
in
its
cradle
abbé
faujas
stretched
out
his
arms
with
an
air
of
ironic
defiance
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
circle
them
round
plassans
and
squeeze
the
life
out
of
it
by
crushing
it
against
his
brawny
chest
and
he
murmured
to
himself
to
think
that
the
imbeciles
laughed
at
me
this
evening
as
they
saw
me
going
through
their
streets
iii
mouret
spent
the
whole
of
the
next
morning
in
playing
the
spy
on
his
new
tenant
this
espionage
would
now
enable
him
to
fill
up
the
idle
hours
which
he
had
hitherto
spent
in
pottering
about
the
house
in
putting
back
into
their
proper
places
any
articles
which
he
happened
to
find
lying
about
and
in
picking
quarrels
with
his
wife
and
children
henceforth
he
would
have
an
occupation
an
amusement
which
would
relieve
the
monotony
of
his
everyday
life
as
he
had
often
said
he
was
not
partial
to
priests
and
yet
abbé
faujas
the
first
one
who
had
entered
into
his
existence
excited
in
him
an
extraordinary
amount
of
interest
this
priest
brought
with
him
a
touch
of
mystery
and
secrecy
that
was
almost
disquieting
although
mouret
was
a
man
and
professed
himself
to
be
a
follower
of
voltaire
yet
in
the
abbé
presence
he
felt
the
astonishment
and
uneasiness
of
a
common
not
a
sound
came
from
the
second
floor
mouret
stood
on
the
staircase
and
listened
eagerly
he
even
ventured
to
go
to
the
loft
as
he
hushed
his
steps
while
passing
along
the
passage
a
pattering
of
slippers
behind
the
door
filled
him
with
emotion
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
making
any
new
discovery
so
he
went
down
into
the
garden
and
strolled
into
the
arbour
at
the
end
of
it
there
raising
his
eyes
and
trying
to
look
through
the
windows
in
order
to
find
out
what
might
be
going
on
in
the
rooms
but
he
could
not
see
even
the
abbé
shadow
madame
faujas
in
the
absence
of
curtains
had
as
a
makeshift
fastened
some
sheets
behind
the
windows
at
lunch
mouret
seemed
quite
vexed
they
dead
upstairs
he
said
as
he
cut
the
children
bread
you
heard
them
move
marthe
my
dear
but
i
have
been
listening
rose
thereupon
cried
out
from
the
kitchen
been
gone
ever
so
long
they
must
be
far
enough
away
now
if
they
kept
on
at
the
same
pace
mouret
summoned
the
cook
and
questioned
her
minutely
went
out
sir
first
the
mother
and
then
the
priest
they
walked
so
softly
that
i
should
never
have
known
anything
about
it
if
their
shadows
had
not
fallen
across
the
kitchen
floor
when
they
opened
the
street
door
i
looked
out
into
the
street
to
see
where
they
were
going
but
they
had
vanished
they
must
have
gone
off
in
a
fine
hurry
is
very
surprising
but
where
was
i
at
the
time
think
you
were
in
the
garden
sir
looking
at
the
grapes
in
the
arbour
this
put
mouret
into
a
very
bad
temper
he
began
to
inveigh
against
priests
they
were
a
set
of
a
parcel
of
underhand
schemers
with
whom
the
devil
himself
would
be
at
a
loss
they
affected
such
ridiculous
prudery
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
priest
wash
his
face
and
then
he
wound
up
by
expressing
his
sorrow
that
he
had
ever
let
his
rooms
to
this
abbé
about
whom
he
knew
nothing
at
all
is
all
your
fault
he
exclaimed
to
his
wife
as
he
got
up
from
table
marthe
was
about
to
protest
and
remind
him
of
their
discussion
on
the
previous
day
but
she
raised
her
eyes
and
simply
looked
at
him
saying
nothing
mouret
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
resolved
to
remain
at
home
he
pottered
up
and
down
between
the
and
the
garden
poking
about
everywhere
pretending
that
nothing
was
in
its
place
and
that
the
house
simply
invited
thieves
then
he
got
indignant
with
serge
and
octave
who
had
set
off
for
the
college
he
said
quite
half
an
hour
too
soon
father
going
out
désirée
whispered
in
her
mother
ear
will
worry
us
to
death
if
he
stays
at
home
marthe
hushed
her
at
last
mouret
began
to
speak
of
a
piece
of
business
which
he
declared
he
must
finish
off
during
the
day
and
then
he
complained
that
he
had
never
a
moment
to
himself
and
could
never
get
a
day
rest
at
home
when
he
felt
he
wanted
it
finally
he
went
away
quite
distressed
that
he
could
not
remain
and
see
what
happened
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
he
was
all
on
fire
with
curiosity
what
about
the
abbé
he
asked
without
even
giving
himself
time
to
take
off
his
hat
marthe
was
working
in
her
usual
place
on
the
terrace
abbé
she
repeated
with
an
appearance
of
surprise
yes
the
abbé
i
really
seen
nothing
of
him
but
i
believe
he
has
got
settled
down
now
rose
told
me
that
some
furniture
had
come
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
exclaimed
mouret
wanted
to
be
here
when
it
came
for
you
see
the
furniture
is
my
security
i
knew
very
well
that
you
would
never
think
of
stirring
from
your
chair
you
have
much
of
a
head
my
dear
rose
rose
the
cook
appeared
in
answer
to
his
summons
and
he
forthwith
asked
her
some
furniture
come
for
the
people
on
the
second
floor
sir
it
came
in
a
little
covered
cart
i
recognised
it
as
bergasse
the
dealer
it
was
a
big
load
madame
faujas
came
on
behind
it
i
dare
say
she
had
been
giving
the
man
who
pushed
it
along
a
helping
hand
up
the
rue
balande
any
rate
you
saw
the
furniture
i
suppose
did
you
notice
what
there
was
sir
i
had
posted
myself
by
the
door
and
it
all
went
past
me
which
did
seem
to
please
madame
faujas
very
much
wait
a
moment
and
i
tell
you
everything
there
was
first
of
all
they
brought
up
an
iron
bedstead
then
a
chest
of
drawers
then
two
tables
and
four
chairs
and
that
was
the
whole
lot
of
it
and
it
was
new
either
i
would
have
given
thirty
crowns
for
the
whole
collection
you
should
have
told
madame
we
can
not
let
the
rooms
under
such
conditions
i
shall
go
at
once
to
talk
to
abbé
bourrette
about
the
matter
he
was
fuming
with
irritation
and
was
just
setting
off
when
marthe
brought
him
to
a
sudden
halt
by
saying
i
had
forgotten
to
tell
you
they
have
paid
me
six
months
rent
in
advance
they
have
paid
you
he
stammered
out
almost
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
the
old
lady
came
down
and
gave
me
this
she
put
her
hand
into
her
and
gave
her
husband
francs
in
neatly
wrapt
up
in
a
piece
of
newspaper
mouret
counted
the
money
and
muttered
long
as
they
pay
they
are
free
to
stop
but
they
are
strange
folks
all
the
same
everyone
ca
be
rich
of
course
but
that
is
no
reason
why
one
should
behave
in
this
suspicious
manner
when
poor
is
something
else
i
have
to
tell
you
marthe
continued
as
she
saw
him
calm
down
old
lady
asked
me
if
we
were
disposed
to
part
with
the
to
her
i
told
her
that
we
made
no
use
of
it
and
that
she
was
welcome
to
keep
it
as
long
as
she
liked
did
quite
right
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
oblige
them
as
i
told
you
before
what
bothers
me
about
these
confounded
priests
is
that
one
never
can
tell
what
they
are
thinking
about
or
what
they
are
up
to
apart
from
that
you
will
often
find
very
honourable
men
amongst
them
the
money
seemed
to
have
consoled
him
he
joked
and
teased
serge
about
his
book
on
the
chinese
missions
which
the
boy
happened
to
be
reading
just
then
during
dinner
he
affected
to
feel
no
further
curiosity
about
the
tenants
of
the
second
floor
but
when
octave
mentioned
that
he
had
seen
abbé
faujas
leaving
the
bishop
residence
he
could
not
restrain
himself
directly
the
dessert
was
placed
on
the
table
he
resumed
his
chatter
of
the
previous
evening
though
after
a
time
he
began
to
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
his
commercial
pursuits
had
made
him
stolid
and
heavy
but
he
really
had
a
keen
mind
he
was
possessed
of
no
little
common
sense
and
accuracy
of
judgment
which
often
enabled
him
to
pick
out
the
truth
from
the
midst
of
all
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood
all
he
said
as
he
went
off
to
bed
has
no
business
to
go
prying
into
other
people
affairs
the
abbé
is
quite
at
liberty
to
do
as
he
pleases
it
is
getting
wearisome
to
be
always
talking
about
these
people
and
i
for
my
part
shall
say
nothing
more
about
them
a
week
passed
away
mouret
had
resumed
his
habitual
life
he
prowled
about
the
house
lectured
his
children
and
spent
his
afternoons
away
from
home
amusing
himself
by
transacting
various
bits
of
business
of
which
he
never
spoke
and
he
ate
and
slept
like
a
man
for
whom
life
is
an
easy
downhill
journey
without
any
jolts
or
surprises
of
any
kind
the
whole
place
sank
back
into
all
its
old
monotony
marthe
occupied
her
accustomed
seat
on
the
terrace
with
her
little
in
front
of
her
désirée
played
by
her
side
the
two
lads
came
home
at
the
usual
time
and
were
as
noisy
as
ever
and
rose
the
cook
grumbled
and
growled
at
everyone
while
the
garden
and
the
retained
all
their
wonted
sleepy
calm
see
now
mouret
often
repeated
to
his
wife
were
quite
mistaken
in
thinking
that
our
comfort
would
be
interfered
with
by
our
letting
the
we
are
as
quiet
and
happy
as
ever
we
were
and
the
house
seems
smaller
and
cosier
he
occasionally
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
windows
which
madame
faujas
had
hung
with
thick
cotton
curtains
on
the
day
after
her
arrival
these
curtains
were
never
drawn
aside
there
was
a
conventual
look
about
their
stern
cold
folds
and
they
seemed
to
tell
of
deep
unbroken
silence
cloistral
stillness
lurking
behind
them
at
distant
intervals
the
windows
were
set
ajar
and
allowed
the
high
shadowy
ceilings
to
be
seen
between
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
curtains
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
that
mouret
kept
on
the
watch
he
could
never
catch
sight
of
the
hand
which
opened
or
closed
them
and
he
never
even
heard
the
grating
of
the
window
fastening
never
did
a
sound
of
human
life
come
down
from
the
second
floor
the
first
week
was
at
an
end
and
mouret
had
not
yet
had
another
glimpse
of
abbé
faujas
that
man
who
was
living
in
his
house
without
he
ever
being
able
to
catch
sight
even
of
his
shadow
began
to
affect
him
with
a
kind
of
nervous
uneasiness
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
he
made
to
appear
indifferent
he
relapsed
into
his
old
questionings
and
started
an
inquiry
you
seen
anything
of
him
he
asked
his
wife
fancy
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
yesterday
as
he
was
coming
in
but
i
am
not
sure
his
mother
always
wears
a
black
dress
and
it
might
have
been
she
that
i
saw
and
as
he
continued
to
press
her
with
questions
marthe
told
him
all
she
knew
says
that
he
goes
out
every
day
and
stays
away
a
long
time
as
for
his
mother
she
is
as
regular
as
a
clock
she
comes
down
at
seven
in
the
morning
to
go
out
and
do
her
marketing
she
has
a
big
basket
which
is
always
closed
and
in
which
she
must
bring
everything
back
with
her
coal
bread
wine
and
provisions
for
no
tradesman
ever
calls
with
anything
for
them
they
are
very
courteous
and
polite
and
rose
says
that
they
always
bow
to
her
when
they
meet
her
but
as
a
rule
she
does
not
even
hear
them
come
down
the
stairs
must
go
in
for
a
funny
sort
of
cooking
up
there
said
mouret
to
whom
all
these
details
conveyed
none
of
the
information
he
wanted
on
another
evening
when
octave
mentioned
that
he
had
seen
abbé
faujas
entering
his
father
asked
him
about
the
appearance
what
effect
he
had
made
upon
the
and
what
he
could
be
going
to
do
in
the
church
you
are
really
much
too
curious
cried
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
did
look
very
fine
in
the
sunshine
with
his
rusty
cassock
i
can
vouch
for
that
much
i
noticed
too
that
as
he
walked
along
he
kept
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
which
made
his
cassock
look
a
little
blacker
he
did
seem
at
all
proud
of
himself
but
hurried
along
with
his
head
bent
down
two
girls
began
to
laugh
as
he
crossed
the
place
the
abbé
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
them
with
an
expression
of
great
softness
did
he
serge
thereupon
serge
related
how
on
several
occasions
as
he
was
returning
from
the
college
he
had
at
a
distance
followed
the
abbé
who
was
on
his
way
back
from
he
passed
through
the
streets
without
speaking
to
anyone
he
seemed
to
know
nobody
and
to
be
rather
hurt
by
the
suppressed
titters
and
jeers
which
he
heard
around
him
they
talk
of
him
then
in
the
town
asked
mouret
whose
interest
was
greatly
aroused
one
has
ever
spoken
to
me
about
him
octave
replied
said
serge
they
do
talk
of
him
abbé
bourrette
nephew
told
me
that
he
was
a
favourite
at
the
church
they
are
not
fond
of
these
priests
who
come
from
a
distance
and
besides
he
has
such
a
miserable
appearance
when
people
get
accustomed
to
him
they
will
leave
the
poor
man
alone
but
just
at
first
it
is
only
natural
that
he
should
attract
notice
marthe
thereupon
advised
the
two
young
fellows
not
to
gratify
any
outsider
curiosity
about
the
abbé
yes
they
may
answer
any
questions
mouret
exclaimed
nothing
that
we
know
of
him
could
be
likely
to
compromise
him
in
any
way
from
that
time
forward
with
the
best
faith
in
the
world
and
without
meaning
the
least
harm
mouret
turned
his
sons
into
a
couple
of
spies
he
told
octave
and
serge
that
they
must
repeat
to
him
all
that
was
said
about
the
priest
in
the
town
and
he
even
instructed
them
to
follow
him
whenever
they
came
across
him
but
the
information
that
was
to
be
derived
from
such
sources
was
quickly
exhausted
the
talk
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
a
strange
curate
in
the
diocese
died
away
the
town
seemed
to
have
extended
its
pardon
to
the
fellow
who
glided
about
in
the
shade
in
such
a
rusty
old
cassock
and
its
only
apparent
feeling
for
him
now
was
one
of
disdain
the
priest
on
the
other
hand
always
went
straight
to
the
cathedral
and
so
returned
from
it
invariably
passing
through
the
same
streets
octave
said
laughingly
that
he
was
sure
he
counted
the
then
mouret
bethought
himself
of
enlisting
the
help
of
désirée
in
the
task
of
collecting
information
in
the
evening
he
took
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
listened
to
her
chatter
about
what
she
had
done
and
what
she
had
seen
during
the
day
and
he
always
tried
to
lead
her
on
to
the
subject
of
the
tenants
of
the
second
floor
just
listen
to
what
i
tell
you
he
said
to
her
one
day
when
the
window
is
open
just
throw
your
ball
into
the
room
and
then
go
up
and
ask
for
it
the
next
day
the
girl
threw
her
ball
into
the
room
but
she
had
scarcely
reached
the
steps
of
the
house
before
the
ball
returned
by
an
invisible
hand
bounced
up
from
the
terrace
her
father
who
had
reckoned
on
the
child
taking
ways
leading
to
a
renewal
of
the
intercourse
which
had
been
interrupted
since
the
day
of
the
arrival
now
lost
all
hope
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
abbé
had
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
to
himself
this
rebuff
however
only
made
mouret
curiosity
all
the
keener
he
even
condescended
to
go
gossiping
in
corners
with
the
cook
to
the
great
displeasure
of
marthe
who
reproached
him
for
his
want
of
but
at
this
he
became
angry
with
her
and
defended
himself
by
lies
however
as
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
it
was
only
in
secret
that
he
henceforth
talked
to
rose
about
the
faujases
one
morning
she
beckoned
to
him
to
follow
her
into
the
kitchen
sir
she
said
as
she
shut
the
door
have
been
watching
for
you
to
come
down
from
your
room
for
more
than
an
hour
you
found
out
something
then
you
shall
hear
yesterday
evening
i
was
chatting
with
madame
faujas
for
more
than
an
hour
mouret
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
he
sat
down
on
an
old
tattered
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
dirty
cloths
and
vegetable
parings
left
from
the
previous
day
and
exclaimed
along
make
haste
continued
the
cook
was
at
the
saying
to
monsieur
rastoil
servant
when
madame
faujas
came
downstairs
to
empty
a
pail
of
dirty
water
in
the
gutter
instead
of
immediately
going
back
again
without
even
turning
her
head
as
she
generally
does
she
stopped
there
for
a
moment
to
look
at
me
then
it
struck
me
that
she
wanted
to
speak
to
me
and
i
said
to
her
that
it
had
been
a
beautiful
day
and
that
it
would
be
good
for
the
grapes
she
said
yes
yes
in
an
unconcerned
sort
of
way
just
like
a
woman
who
has
no
land
and
has
no
interest
in
such
matters
but
she
put
down
her
pail
and
made
no
attempt
to
go
away
she
even
came
and
leant
against
the
wall
beside
me
well
what
did
she
say
to
you
cried
mouret
tortured
by
his
impatience
of
course
you
understand
i
was
silly
enough
to
begin
to
question
her
she
would
have
gone
straight
off
if
i
had
without
seeming
to
intend
anything
i
suggested
things
to
her
which
i
thought
might
set
her
talking
the
curé
of
that
worthy
monsieur
compan
happened
to
pass
by
and
i
told
her
he
was
very
ill
and
was
long
for
this
world
and
that
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
filling
his
place
at
the
cathedral
she
was
all
ears
at
once
i
can
tell
you
she
even
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
with
monsieur
compan
then
going
on
from
one
thing
to
another
i
gradually
got
talking
about
our
bishop
monseigneur
rousselot
was
a
most
excellent
and
worthy
man
i
told
her
she
did
not
know
his
age
so
i
told
her
that
he
was
sixty
very
delicate
also
and
that
he
let
himself
be
led
by
the
nose
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
monsieur
fenil
who
is
all
powerful
with
the
bishop
the
old
lady
was
quite
interested
in
that
and
she
would
have
stayed
out
in
the
street
all
night
listening
an
expression
of
desperation
passed
over
mouret
face
what
you
telling
me
is
what
you
said
yourself
he
cried
was
it
that
she
said
that
what
i
want
to
hear
a
little
and
let
me
finish
rose
replied
very
calmly
was
gradually
gaining
my
purpose
to
win
her
confidence
i
ended
by
talking
to
her
about
ourselves
i
told
her
that
you
were
monsieur
françois
mouret
a
retired
merchant
from
marseilles
and
that
you
had
managed
in
fifteen
years
to
make
a
fortune
out
of
wines
and
oils
and
almonds
i
added
that
you
had
preferred
to
come
and
settle
down
and
live
on
your
means
in
plassans
a
quiet
town
where
your
wife
relations
lived
i
even
contrived
to
let
her
know
too
that
madame
was
your
cousin
that
you
were
forty
years
old
and
that
she
was
and
that
you
lived
very
happily
together
in
fact
i
told
her
all
about
you
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
interested
and
kept
saying
yes
yes
in
her
deliberate
way
and
when
i
stopped
for
a
moment
she
nodded
her
head
as
though
to
tell
me
she
was
listening
and
that
i
might
go
on
so
we
went
on
talking
in
this
way
with
our
backs
against
the
wall
like
a
couple
of
old
friends
till
it
was
quite
dark
mouret
bounced
from
his
chair
in
angry
indignation
he
cried
that
all
she
led
you
on
to
gossip
to
her
for
an
hour
and
she
herself
told
you
nothing
it
got
dark
she
said
to
me
the
air
is
becoming
quite
chilly
and
then
she
took
up
her
pail
and
went
back
upstairs
are
nothing
but
an
idiot
that
old
woman
up
there
is
more
than
a
match
for
half
a
score
such
as
you
ah
they
be
laughing
finely
now
that
they
have
wormed
out
of
you
all
that
they
wanted
to
know
about
us
do
you
hear
me
rose
i
tell
you
that
you
are
nothing
but
an
idiot
the
old
cook
waxed
very
indignant
and
began
to
bounce
excitedly
up
and
down
the
kitchen
knocking
the
pots
and
pans
about
noisily
and
crumpling
up
the
dusters
and
flinging
them
down
was
scarcely
worth
your
while
sir
she
hissed
come
into
my
kitchen
to
call
me
insulting
names
you
had
better
take
yourself
off
what
i
did
i
did
to
please
you
if
madame
finds
us
here
together
talking
about
those
people
she
will
be
angry
with
me
and
quite
rightly
because
it
is
wrong
for
us
to
be
doing
so
and
after
all
i
could
drag
words
from
the
old
lady
lips
if
she
willing
to
talk
i
did
as
any
one
else
would
have
done
under
the
same
circumstances
i
talked
and
told
her
about
your
affairs
and
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
that
she
did
tell
me
about
hers
go
and
ask
her
about
them
yourself
since
you
are
anxious
to
know
about
them
perhaps
you
wo
make
such
an
idiot
of
yourself
as
i
have
done
she
had
raised
her
voice
and
was
talking
so
loudly
that
mouret
thought
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
retire
and
he
did
so
closing
the
kitchen
door
after
him
in
order
to
prevent
his
wife
from
hearing
the
servant
but
rose
immediately
pulled
it
open
again
and
cried
after
him
down
the
passage
shall
bother
myself
about
it
no
longer
do
you
hear
you
may
get
somebody
else
to
do
your
underhand
business
for
you
mouret
was
quite
vanquished
he
showed
some
irritation
at
his
defeat
and
tried
to
console
himself
by
saying
that
those
tenants
of
his
were
mere
nobodies
gradually
he
succeeded
in
making
this
opinion
of
his
that
of
his
acquaintances
and
then
that
of
the
whole
town
abbé
faujas
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
priest
without
means
and
without
ambition
who
was
completely
outside
the
pale
of
the
intrigues
of
the
diocese
people
imagined
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
poverty
that
he
was
glad
to
perform
any
unpleasant
duties
in
connection
with
the
cathedral
and
tried
to
keep
himself
in
obscurity
as
much
as
possible
there
was
only
one
matter
of
curiosity
left
in
connection
with
him
and
that
was
the
reason
of
his
having
come
to
plassans
from
besançon
queer
stories
were
circulated
about
him
but
they
all
seemed
very
improbable
mouret
himself
who
had
played
the
spy
over
his
tenants
simply
for
amusement
and
in
order
to
pass
the
time
just
as
he
would
have
played
a
game
at
cards
or
bowls
was
even
beginning
to
forget
that
he
had
a
priest
living
in
his
house
when
an
incident
occurred
which
revived
all
his
curiosity
one
afternoon
as
he
was
returning
home
he
saw
abbé
faujas
going
up
the
rue
balande
in
front
of
him
mouret
slackened
his
pace
and
examined
the
priest
at
his
leisure
although
abbé
faujas
had
been
lodging
in
his
house
for
a
month
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
thus
seen
him
in
broad
daylight
the
abbé
still
wore
his
old
cassock
and
he
walked
slowly
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
head
bare
in
spite
of
the
chilly
air
the
street
which
was
a
very
steep
one
with
the
shutters
of
its
big
bare
houses
always
closed
was
quite
deserted
mouret
who
quickened
his
pace
was
at
last
obliged
to
walk
on
for
fear
lest
the
priest
should
hear
him
and
make
his
escape
but
as
they
neared
monsieur
rastoil
house
a
group
of
people
turning
out
of
the
place
of
the
entered
it
abbé
faujas
made
a
slight
détour
to
avoid
these
persons
he
watched
the
door
close
and
then
suddenly
stopping
he
turned
round
towards
his
landlord
who
was
now
close
up
to
him
am
very
glad
to
have
met
you
said
he
with
all
his
wonted
politeness
i
should
have
ventured
to
disturb
you
this
evening
the
last
time
it
rained
the
wet
came
through
the
ceiling
of
my
room
and
i
should
much
like
to
show
it
you
mouret
remained
standing
in
front
of
him
and
stammered
in
confusion
that
he
was
entirely
at
the
abbé
service
then
as
they
went
indoors
together
he
asked
him
at
what
time
he
should
go
to
look
at
the
ceiling
i
should
like
you
to
come
at
once
the
abbé
replied
it
would
be
troubling
you
too
much
mouret
went
up
the
stairs
after
him
so
excited
that
he
almost
choked
while
rose
followed
them
with
her
eyes
from
the
kitchen
doorway
quite
dazed
with
astonishment
iv
when
mouret
reached
the
second
floor
he
was
more
perturbed
than
a
youth
at
his
first
assignation
the
unexpected
satisfaction
of
his
long
thwarted
desires
and
the
hope
of
seeing
something
quite
extraordinary
almost
prevented
him
from
breathing
abbé
faujas
slipped
the
key
which
he
carried
and
which
he
quite
concealed
in
his
big
fingers
into
the
lock
without
making
the
faintest
noise
and
the
door
opened
as
silently
as
if
it
had
been
hung
upon
velvet
hinges
then
the
abbé
stepping
back
mutely
motioned
to
mouret
to
enter
the
cotton
curtains
at
the
two
windows
were
so
thick
that
the
room
lay
in
a
pale
chalky
dimness
like
the
of
a
convent
cell
it
was
a
very
large
room
with
a
lofty
ceiling
and
a
quiet
neat
of
a
faded
yellow
mouret
ventured
forward
advancing
with
short
steps
over
the
tiled
floor
which
was
as
smooth
and
shiny
as
a
mirror
and
so
cold
that
he
seemed
to
feel
a
chill
through
the
soles
of
his
boots
he
glanced
furtively
around
him
and
examined
the
curtainless
iron
bedstead
the
sheets
of
which
were
so
straightly
stretched
that
it
looked
like
a
block
of
white
stone
lying
in
the
corner
the
chest
of
drawers
stowed
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
little
table
in
the
middle
and
two
chairs
one
before
each
window
completed
the
furniture
there
was
not
a
single
paper
on
the
table
not
an
article
of
any
kind
on
the
chest
of
drawers
not
a
garment
hanging
against
the
walls
everything
was
perfectly
bare
except
that
over
the
chest
of
drawers
there
was
suspended
a
big
black
wooden
crucifix
looking
like
a
dark
splotch
amidst
the
bare
greyness
of
the
room
this
way
sir
will
you
said
the
abbé
is
in
this
corner
that
the
ceiling
is
stained
but
mouret
did
not
hurry
he
was
enjoying
himself
although
he
saw
none
of
the
extraordinary
things
that
he
had
vaguely
expected
to
see
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
peculiar
odour
about
the
room
it
smelt
of
a
priest
he
thought
of
a
man
with
different
ways
from
other
men
but
it
vexed
him
that
he
could
see
nothing
on
which
he
might
base
some
hypothesis
carelessly
left
on
any
of
the
pieces
of
furniture
or
in
any
corner
of
the
apartment
the
room
was
just
like
its
provoking
occupant
silent
cold
and
inscrutable
he
was
extremely
surprised
too
not
to
find
any
appearance
of
poverty
as
he
had
expected
on
the
contrary
the
room
produced
upon
him
much
the
same
impression
as
he
had
felt
when
he
had
once
entered
the
richly
furnished
of
the
prefect
of
marseilles
the
big
crucifix
seemed
to
fill
it
with
its
black
arms
mouret
felt
however
that
he
must
go
and
look
at
the
corner
which
abbé
faujas
was
inviting
him
to
inspect
see
the
stain
do
you
asked
the
priest
has
faded
a
little
since
yesterday
mouret
rose
upon
and
strained
his
eyes
but
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
when
the
abbé
had
drawn
back
the
curtains
he
was
able
to
distinguish
a
slight
nothing
very
serious
he
said
no
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
tell
you
of
it
the
wet
must
have
soaked
through
near
the
edge
of
the
roof
you
are
right
near
the
edge
of
the
roof
mouret
made
no
further
remark
he
was
again
examining
the
room
now
clear
and
distinct
in
the
full
daylight
it
looked
less
solemn
than
before
but
it
remained
as
taciturn
as
ever
there
was
not
even
a
speck
of
dust
lying
about
to
tell
aught
of
the
abbé
life
continued
the
priest
may
be
able
to
discover
the
place
from
the
window
just
wait
a
moment
he
proceeded
to
open
the
window
but
mouret
protested
against
him
troubling
himself
any
further
saying
that
the
workmen
would
easily
be
able
to
find
the
leak
is
no
trouble
at
all
i
assure
you
replied
the
abbé
with
polite
insistence
know
that
landlords
like
to
know
how
matters
are
going
on
inspect
everything
i
beg
of
you
the
house
is
yours
as
he
spoke
these
last
words
he
smiled
a
thing
he
did
but
rarely
and
then
as
mouret
and
himself
leaned
over
the
rail
that
crossed
the
window
and
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
guttering
he
launched
out
into
various
technical
details
trying
to
account
for
the
appearance
of
the
stain
think
there
has
been
a
slight
depression
of
the
tiles
perhaps
even
a
breakage
unless
indeed
that
crack
which
you
can
see
up
there
in
the
cornice
extends
into
the
yes
that
is
very
possible
mouret
replied
i
must
confess
monsieur
that
i
really
do
understand
anything
about
these
matters
however
the
masons
will
see
to
it
the
priest
said
nothing
further
on
the
subject
but
quietly
remained
where
he
was
gazing
out
upon
the
garden
beneath
him
mouret
who
was
leaning
by
his
side
thought
it
would
be
impolite
to
hurry
away
he
was
quite
won
over
when
his
tenant
after
an
interval
of
silence
said
to
him
in
his
soft
voice
have
a
very
pretty
garden
sir
it
nothing
out
of
the
common
replied
mouret
used
to
be
some
fine
trees
which
i
was
obliged
to
cut
down
for
nothing
would
grow
in
their
shade
and
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
utility
you
know
this
plot
is
quite
large
enough
for
us
and
keeps
us
in
vegetables
all
through
the
season
the
abbé
seemed
surprised
and
asked
mouret
for
details
the
garden
was
an
country
garden
surrounded
with
arbours
and
divided
into
four
regular
square
plots
by
tall
borders
of
box
in
the
middle
was
a
shallow
basin
but
there
was
no
fountain
only
one
of
the
squares
was
devoted
to
flowers
in
the
other
three
which
were
planted
at
their
edges
with
one
saw
some
magnificent
cabbages
lettuces
and
other
vegetables
the
paths
of
yellow
gravel
were
kept
extremely
neat
is
a
little
paradise
said
abbé
faujas
are
several
disadvantages
all
the
same
replied
mouret
who
felt
extremely
delighted
at
hearing
his
ground
so
highly
praised
will
have
noticed
for
instance
that
we
are
on
a
slope
and
that
the
gardens
hereabouts
are
on
different
levels
monsieur
rastoil
is
lower
than
mine
which
again
is
lower
than
that
of
the
the
consequence
is
that
the
rain
often
does
a
great
deal
of
damage
then
too
a
still
greater
disadvantage
is
that
the
people
in
the
overlook
me
and
the
more
so
now
that
they
have
made
that
terrace
which
commands
my
wall
it
is
true
that
i
overlook
monsieur
rastoil
garden
but
that
is
very
poor
compensation
i
can
assure
you
for
a
man
who
never
troubles
himself
about
his
doings
the
priest
seemed
to
be
listening
out
of
mere
complaisance
just
nodding
his
head
occasionally
but
making
no
remarks
he
followed
with
his
eyes
the
motions
of
his
landlord
hand
there
is
still
another
inconvenience
continued
mouret
pointing
to
a
path
that
skirted
the
bottom
of
the
garden
see
that
little
lane
between
the
two
walls
it
is
called
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
and
leads
to
a
to
the
grounds
of
the
well
all
the
neighbouring
properties
have
little
doors
giving
access
to
the
lane
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
mysterious
comings
and
goings
for
my
part
being
a
family
man
with
children
i
fastened
my
door
up
with
a
couple
of
stout
nails
he
looked
at
the
abbé
and
winked
hoping
that
the
priest
would
question
him
about
the
mysterious
comings
and
goings
to
which
he
had
just
alluded
but
abbé
faujas
seemed
quite
unconcerned
he
merely
glanced
at
the
alley
without
showing
any
curiosity
on
the
subject
then
he
again
gazed
placidly
upon
the
mourets
garden
marthe
was
in
her
customary
place
near
the
edge
of
the
terrace
hemming
napkins
she
had
raised
her
head
on
first
hearing
voices
and
then
had
resumed
her
work
again
full
of
surprise
at
seeing
her
husband
at
one
of
the
windows
in
the
company
of
the
priest
she
now
appeared
to
be
quite
unconscious
of
their
presence
mouret
however
had
raised
his
voice
from
a
sort
of
instinctive
braggartism
proud
of
being
able
to
show
his
wife
that
he
had
at
last
made
his
way
into
that
room
which
had
so
persistently
been
kept
private
the
abbé
on
his
side
every
now
and
then
let
his
calm
eyes
rest
upon
the
woman
though
all
that
he
could
see
of
her
was
the
back
of
her
bent
neck
and
her
black
coil
of
hair
they
were
both
silent
again
and
abbé
faujas
still
seemed
disinclined
to
leave
the
window
he
now
appeared
to
be
examining
their
flower
beds
monsieur
rastoil
garden
was
arranged
in
the
english
fashion
with
little
walks
and
grass
plots
broken
by
small
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
circular
cluster
of
trees
underneath
which
a
table
and
some
rustic
chairs
were
set
rastoil
is
very
wealthy
resumed
mouret
who
had
followed
the
direction
of
the
abbé
eyes
garden
costs
him
a
large
sum
of
money
the
waterfall
you
ca
see
it
from
here
it
is
behind
those
trees
ran
away
with
more
than
three
hundred
francs
there
is
a
vegetable
about
the
place
nothing
but
flowers
at
one
time
the
ladies
even
talked
of
cutting
down
the
but
that
would
have
really
been
wicked
for
the
are
magnificent
specimens
well
i
suppose
a
man
has
a
right
to
lay
out
his
ground
so
as
to
please
his
own
fancy
if
he
can
afford
to
do
so
then
as
the
abbé
still
continued
silent
he
continued
know
monsieur
rastoil
do
you
every
morning
from
eight
till
nine
he
walks
about
under
his
trees
he
is
a
heavy
man
rather
short
bald
and
clean
shaven
with
a
head
as
round
as
a
ball
he
completed
his
sixtieth
year
at
the
beginning
of
last
august
i
believe
he
has
been
president
of
our
civil
tribunal
for
nearly
twenty
years
folks
say
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
but
i
see
very
little
of
him
and
that
about
all
that
ever
passes
between
us
he
stopped
speaking
as
he
saw
several
people
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
neighbouring
house
and
making
their
way
towards
the
clump
of
trees
yes
he
resumed
lowering
his
voice
tuesday
there
is
a
dinner
party
at
the
rastoils
the
abbé
had
not
been
able
to
restrain
a
slight
start
and
had
then
bent
forward
to
see
better
two
priests
who
were
walking
beside
a
couple
of
tall
girls
seemed
particularly
to
interest
him
you
know
who
those
gentlemen
are
mouret
inquired
and
when
the
priest
only
replied
by
a
vague
gesture
he
added
were
crossing
the
rue
balande
just
as
we
met
each
other
the
taller
and
younger
one
the
one
who
is
walking
between
monsieur
rastoil
two
daughters
is
abbé
surin
our
bishop
secretary
he
is
said
to
be
a
very
amiable
young
man
the
old
one
who
is
walking
a
little
behind
is
one
of
our
abbé
fenil
he
is
at
the
head
of
the
seminary
he
is
a
terrible
man
flat
and
sharp
like
a
sabre
i
wish
he
would
turn
round
so
that
you
might
see
his
eyes
i
am
quite
surprised
that
you
do
know
those
gentlemen
go
out
very
little
said
the
abbé
there
is
no
house
in
the
town
that
i
visit
that
is
right
you
must
often
feel
very
dull
to
do
you
justice
monsieur
you
are
certainly
not
of
an
inquisitive
disposition
just
fancy
you
been
here
a
month
now
and
you
even
know
that
monsieur
rastoil
had
a
every
tuesday
why
it
right
before
your
eyes
there
from
this
window
mouret
laughed
slightly
he
was
forming
a
rather
contemptuous
opinion
of
the
abbé
then
in
confidential
tones
he
went
on
see
that
tall
old
man
who
is
with
madame
rastoil
the
thin
one
i
mean
with
broad
brims
to
his
hat
well
that
is
monsieur
de
bourdeu
the
former
prefect
of
the
drôme
a
prefect
who
was
turned
out
of
office
by
the
revolution
of
he
another
one
that
you
do
know
be
bound
but
monsieur
maffre
there
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
old
gentleman
who
is
coming
last
with
monsieur
rastoil
do
you
know
him
well
that
is
really
inexcusable
he
is
an
honorary
canon
of
between
ourselves
he
is
accused
of
having
killed
his
wife
by
his
harshness
and
miserliness
mouret
stopped
short
looked
the
abbé
in
the
face
and
said
abruptly
with
a
smile
beg
your
pardon
but
i
am
not
a
very
devout
person
you
know
the
abbé
again
waved
his
hand
with
that
vague
gesture
which
did
duty
as
an
answer
and
saved
him
the
necessity
of
making
a
more
explicit
reply
i
am
not
a
very
devout
person
mouret
repeated
smilingly
everyone
should
be
left
free
is
it
not
so
the
rastoils
now
are
a
religious
family
you
must
have
seen
the
mother
and
daughters
at
they
are
parishioners
of
yours
ah
those
poor
girls
the
elder
angéline
is
fully
years
old
and
the
other
aurélie
is
getting
on
for
and
they
no
beauties
either
quite
yellow
and
the
parents
wo
let
the
younger
one
marry
before
her
sister
but
i
dare
say
they
both
end
by
finding
husbands
somewhere
if
only
for
the
sake
of
their
dowries
their
mother
there
that
fat
little
woman
who
looks
as
innocent
and
mild
as
a
sheep
has
given
poor
rastoil
some
pretty
experiences
he
winked
his
left
eye
a
common
habit
of
his
whenever
he
indulged
in
any
pleasantry
approaching
broadness
the
abbé
lowered
his
eyes
as
if
waiting
for
mouret
to
go
on
but
as
the
latter
remained
silent
he
raised
them
again
and
watched
the
people
in
the
garden
as
they
seated
themselves
round
the
table
under
the
trees
at
last
mouret
resumed
his
explanatory
remarks
will
stay
out
there
enjoying
the
fresh
air
till
said
he
is
just
the
same
every
tuesday
that
abbé
surin
is
a
great
favourite
look
how
he
is
laughing
there
with
mademoiselle
aurélie
ah
abbé
fenil
has
observed
us
what
eyes
he
has
he
is
very
fond
of
me
you
know
as
i
had
a
dispute
with
a
relation
of
his
but
where
has
abbé
bourrette
got
to
we
have
seen
anything
of
him
have
we
it
is
very
extraordinary
he
never
misses
monsieur
rastoil
tuesdays
he
must
be
you
know
him
do
you
what
a
worthy
man
he
is
a
most
devoted
servant
of
god
abbé
faujas
was
no
longer
listening
his
eyes
were
constantly
meeting
those
of
abbé
fenil
whose
scrutiny
he
bore
with
perfect
calmness
never
once
diverting
his
glance
he
was
even
leaning
more
fully
against
the
iron
rail
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
grown
bigger
here
come
the
young
people
resumed
mouret
as
three
young
men
arrived
on
the
scene
oldest
one
is
rastoil
son
he
has
just
been
called
to
the
bar
the
two
others
are
the
sons
of
monsieur
maffre
they
are
still
at
college
i
wonder
why
those
young
scamps
of
mine
have
come
back
yet
at
that
very
moment
octave
and
serge
made
their
appearance
on
the
terrace
leaning
against
the
balustrade
they
began
to
tease
désirée
who
had
just
sat
down
by
her
mother
side
however
when
the
young
folks
caught
sight
of
their
father
at
the
window
they
lowered
their
voices
and
quietly
laughed
you
see
all
my
little
family
said
mouret
complacently
stay
at
home
we
do
and
we
have
no
visitors
our
garden
is
a
closed
paradise
which
the
devil
ca
enter
to
tempt
us
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
for
he
was
really
amusing
himself
at
the
expense
the
latter
had
slowly
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
upon
the
group
formed
by
his
landlord
family
under
the
window
he
gazed
down
there
for
a
moment
then
looked
round
upon
the
garden
with
its
beds
of
vegetables
edged
with
borders
of
box
then
again
turned
his
eyes
towards
monsieur
rastoil
pretentious
grounds
and
last
of
all
as
though
he
wanted
to
get
the
plan
of
the
whole
surroundings
into
his
head
directed
his
attention
to
the
garden
of
the
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
here
but
a
large
central
lawn
a
gently
undulating
carpet
of
grass
with
clusters
of
evergreen
shrubs
and
some
tall
chestnut
trees
which
gave
a
appearance
to
this
patch
of
ground
hemmed
in
by
the
neighbouring
houses
abbé
faujas
glanced
under
the
and
at
last
remarked
gardens
are
quite
lively
there
are
some
people
too
in
the
one
on
the
left
mouret
raised
his
eyes
yes
he
said
unconcernedly
like
that
every
afternoon
they
are
the
friends
of
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
our
in
the
they
meet
in
the
evenings
in
the
same
way
round
the
basin
on
the
left
which
you
ca
see
from
here
ah
so
monsieur
de
condamin
has
got
back
that
fine
old
man
there
who
is
so
well
preserved
and
has
such
a
bright
colour
he
is
our
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
a
jovial
old
fellow
who
is
constantly
to
be
seen
gloved
and
tightly
breeched
on
horseback
and
the
tales
he
can
tell
too
he
does
belong
to
this
neighbourhood
and
he
has
lately
married
a
very
young
woman
however
that
fortunately
no
business
of
mine
he
bent
his
head
again
as
he
heard
désirée
who
was
playing
with
serge
break
out
into
one
of
her
childish
laughs
but
the
abbé
whose
face
was
now
slightly
flushed
recalled
his
attention
by
asking
that
the
that
fat
gentleman
with
the
white
tie
this
question
seemed
to
amuse
mouret
exceedingly
no
he
replied
with
a
laugh
is
very
evident
that
you
know
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
he
is
forty
yet
he
a
tall
handsome
very
young
man
that
fat
gentleman
is
doctor
porquier
the
fashionable
medical
man
of
plassans
he
is
a
very
man
i
can
assure
you
and
he
has
only
one
trouble
his
son
guillaume
do
you
see
those
two
people
sitting
on
the
bench
with
their
backs
towards
us
they
are
monsieur
paloque
the
assistant
judge
and
his
wife
they
are
the
ugliest
couple
in
the
town
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
the
husband
or
the
wife
fortunately
they
have
no
children
mouret
began
to
laugh
more
loudly
he
was
growing
excited
and
kept
on
striking
the
can
never
look
at
the
assemblies
in
those
grounds
he
continued
motioning
with
his
head
first
towards
monsieur
rastoil
garden
and
then
towards
the
being
highly
amused
you
do
take
any
interest
in
politics
monsieur
or
i
could
tell
you
some
things
which
would
tickle
you
immensely
rightly
or
wrongly
i
myself
pass
for
a
republican
business
matters
take
me
a
good
deal
about
the
country
i
am
a
friend
of
the
peasantry
and
people
have
even
talked
about
proposing
me
for
the
in
short
i
am
a
man
well
on
my
right
here
at
monsieur
rastoil
we
have
the
cream
of
the
legitimists
and
on
the
left
at
the
we
have
the
of
the
empire
and
so
you
see
my
poor
garden
my
little
happy
nook
lies
between
two
hostile
camps
i
am
continually
afraid
lest
they
should
begin
throwing
stones
at
each
other
for
the
stones
you
see
might
very
well
fall
into
my
garden
mouret
appeared
to
be
quite
delighted
with
this
witticism
and
drew
closer
to
the
abbé
like
some
old
gossip
who
is
just
going
to
launch
out
into
a
long
story
is
a
very
curious
place
from
a
political
point
of
view
the
coup
succeeded
here
because
the
town
is
conservative
but
first
of
all
it
is
legitimist
and
orleanist
so
much
so
indeed
that
at
the
outset
of
the
empire
it
wanted
to
dictate
conditions
as
its
claims
were
disregarded
the
town
grew
annoyed
and
went
over
to
the
opposition
yes
monsieur
to
the
opposition
last
year
we
elected
for
our
deputy
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
an
old
nobleman
of
mediocre
abilities
but
one
whose
election
was
a
very
bitter
pill
for
the
ah
look
there
is
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
he
is
with
the
mayor
monsieur
delangre
the
abbé
glanced
keenly
in
the
direction
indicated
by
mouret
the
a
very
dark
man
was
smiling
beneath
his
waxed
moustaches
he
was
irreproachably
dressed
and
preserved
a
demeanour
which
suggested
both
that
of
a
fashionable
officer
and
that
of
a
diplomatist
the
mayor
was
by
his
side
talking
and
gesticulating
rapidly
he
was
a
short
man
with
square
shoulders
and
a
sunken
face
that
was
rather
in
appearance
he
seemed
to
be
garrulously
inclined
péqueur
des
saulaies
continued
mouret
felt
so
confident
of
the
return
of
the
official
candidate
that
the
result
of
the
election
nearly
made
him
ill
it
was
very
amusing
on
the
evening
of
the
election
the
garden
of
the
remained
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
a
cemetery
while
in
the
rastoils
grounds
there
were
lamps
and
candles
burning
under
the
trees
and
joyous
laughter
and
a
perfect
uproar
of
triumph
our
people
do
let
things
be
seen
from
the
street
but
they
throw
off
all
restraint
and
give
full
vent
to
their
feelings
in
their
gardens
oh
yes
i
see
singular
things
sometimes
though
i
do
say
anything
about
them
he
checked
himself
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
unwilling
to
say
more
but
his
gossiping
propensities
were
too
strong
for
him
wonder
what
course
they
will
now
take
at
the
he
continued
will
never
get
their
candidate
elected
again
they
do
understand
the
people
about
here
and
besides
they
are
very
weak
i
was
told
that
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
was
to
have
had
a
prefecture
if
the
election
had
gone
off
all
right
ah
he
will
remain
a
for
a
long
time
yet
i
imagine
what
stratagem
will
they
devise
i
wonder
to
overthrow
the
marquis
they
will
certainly
have
recourse
to
one
of
some
kind
or
other
they
will
do
their
best
somehow
to
effect
the
conquest
of
plassans
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
abbé
at
whom
he
had
ceased
to
look
for
the
last
few
moments
and
he
suddenly
checked
himself
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
priest
eager
face
his
glistening
eyes
and
his
ears
that
seemed
to
have
grown
bigger
all
mouret
prudence
then
reasserted
itself
and
he
felt
that
he
had
said
too
much
so
he
hastily
added
after
all
i
really
know
nothing
about
it
people
tell
so
many
ridiculous
stories
all
i
care
about
is
to
be
allowed
to
live
quietly
in
my
own
house
he
would
then
have
liked
to
leave
the
window
but
he
dared
not
go
away
so
suddenly
after
gossiping
in
such
an
unrestrained
and
familiar
fashion
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
if
one
of
them
had
been
having
his
laugh
at
the
other
it
certainly
was
not
he
the
abbé
for
his
part
was
again
glancing
alternately
at
the
two
gardens
in
a
calm
unconcerned
manner
and
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
induce
mouret
to
continue
talking
mouret
was
already
wishing
somewhat
impatiently
that
his
wife
or
one
of
his
children
would
call
to
him
to
come
down
when
he
was
greatly
relieved
by
seeing
rose
appear
on
the
steps
outside
the
house
she
raised
her
head
towards
him
sir
she
cried
you
coming
at
all
the
soup
has
been
on
the
table
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
right
rose
i
be
down
directly
he
replied
then
he
made
his
apologies
to
the
abbé
and
left
the
window
the
chilly
aspect
of
the
room
which
he
had
forgotten
while
his
back
had
been
turned
to
it
added
to
the
confusion
he
felt
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
huge
with
its
awful
black
crucifix
which
must
have
heard
everything
he
had
said
when
the
abbé
took
leave
of
him
with
a
silent
bow
this
sudden
finish
of
their
conversation
so
disturbed
him
that
he
again
stepped
back
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
said
is
in
that
corner
then
is
asked
the
abbé
in
surprise
damp
stain
that
you
spoke
to
me
about
the
priest
could
not
restrain
a
smile
but
he
again
pointed
out
the
stain
to
mouret
i
can
see
it
quite
plainly
now
said
the
latter
i
send
the
workmen
up
then
he
at
last
left
the
room
and
before
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
landing
the
door
was
noiselessly
closed
behind
him
the
silence
of
the
staircase
irritated
him
extremely
and
as
he
went
down
he
muttered
confounded
fellow
he
gets
everything
out
of
one
without
asking
a
single
question
v
the
next
morning
old
madame
rougon
marthe
mother
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
mourets
it
was
quite
an
event
for
there
was
a
coolness
between
mouret
and
his
wife
relations
which
had
increased
since
the
election
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
whose
success
the
rougons
attributed
to
mouret
influence
in
the
rural
districts
marthe
used
to
go
alone
when
she
went
to
see
her
parents
her
mother
black
félicité
as
she
was
called
had
retained
at
years
of
age
all
the
slimness
and
vivacity
of
a
girl
she
always
wore
silk
dresses
covered
with
flounces
and
was
particularly
partial
to
yellows
and
browns
when
she
arrived
only
marthe
and
mouret
were
in
the
cried
the
latter
in
great
surprise
as
he
saw
her
coming
your
mother
i
wonder
what
she
wants
she
was
here
less
than
a
month
ago
she
scheming
after
something
or
other
i
know
the
rougons
whose
assistant
mouret
had
been
prior
to
his
marriage
when
their
shabby
little
shop
in
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
had
ever
suggested
bankruptcy
were
the
objects
of
his
constant
suspicions
they
returned
the
feeling
with
bitter
and
animosity
their
rancour
being
especially
aroused
by
the
speedy
success
which
had
attended
him
in
business
when
their
said
simply
owe
my
fortune
to
my
own
exertions
they
bit
their
lips
and
understood
quite
well
that
he
was
accusing
them
of
having
gained
theirs
by
less
honourable
means
notwithstanding
the
fine
house
she
now
had
on
the
place
of
the
félicité
silently
envied
the
peaceful
little
home
of
the
mourets
with
all
the
bitter
jealousy
of
a
retired
shopkeeper
who
owed
her
fortune
to
something
else
than
the
profits
of
her
business
félicité
kissed
marthe
on
the
forehead
and
then
gave
her
hand
to
mouret
she
and
her
generally
affected
a
mocking
tone
in
their
conversations
together
she
said
to
him
with
a
smile
gendarmes
have
been
for
you
yet
then
you
revolutionist
not
yet
he
replied
with
a
responsive
smile
are
waiting
till
your
husband
gives
them
the
order
very
nice
and
polite
of
you
to
say
that
exclaimed
félicité
whose
eyes
were
beginning
to
glisten
marthe
turned
a
beseeching
glance
upon
mouret
he
had
gone
too
far
but
his
feelings
were
roused
and
he
added
gracious
what
are
we
thinking
of
to
receive
you
in
the
let
us
go
into
the
i
beg
you
this
was
one
of
his
usual
pleasantries
he
affected
all
fine
airs
whenever
he
received
a
visit
from
her
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
marthe
protested
that
they
were
very
comfortable
where
they
were
her
husband
insisted
that
she
and
her
mother
should
follow
him
into
the
when
they
got
there
he
bustled
about
opening
the
shutters
and
drawing
out
the
chairs
the
which
was
seldom
entered
and
the
shutters
of
which
were
generally
kept
closed
was
a
great
wilderness
of
a
room
with
furniture
swathed
in
white
which
were
turning
yellow
from
the
proximity
of
the
damp
garden
is
really
disgraceful
muttered
mouret
wiping
the
dust
from
a
small
console
wretched
rose
neglects
everything
abominably
then
turning
towards
his
he
said
with
irony
will
excuse
us
for
receiving
you
in
this
way
in
our
poor
dwelling
we
can
not
all
be
wealthy
félicité
was
choking
with
rage
she
scanned
mouret
for
a
moment
and
almost
indulged
in
a
burst
of
anger
but
she
made
an
effort
to
restrain
herself
and
slowly
dropped
her
eyes
when
she
again
raised
them
she
spoke
in
a
pleasant
tone
have
just
been
calling
upon
madame
de
condamin
she
said
i
thought
i
would
look
in
here
and
see
how
you
all
were
the
children
are
well
i
hope
and
you
too
my
dear
mouret
we
are
all
wonderfully
well
he
replied
quite
astonished
by
this
amiability
but
the
old
lady
gave
him
no
time
to
import
any
fresh
unpleasantness
into
the
conversation
for
she
began
to
question
marthe
affectionately
about
all
sorts
of
trifles
playing
the
part
of
a
fond
grandmother
and
scolding
mouret
for
not
sending
the
dear
children
to
see
her
oftener
for
she
was
always
so
delighted
to
have
them
with
her
said
she
here
we
are
in
october
again
she
remarked
carelessly
after
awhile
i
shall
be
having
my
day
again
thursdays
as
in
former
seasons
i
shall
count
upon
seeing
you
my
dear
marthe
of
course
and
you
too
mouret
you
will
look
in
occasionally
wo
you
and
not
go
on
sulking
with
us
for
ever
mouret
who
was
growing
a
little
suspicious
of
all
his
affectionate
chatter
was
at
a
loss
how
to
reply
he
had
not
expected
such
a
thrust
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
which
he
could
take
exception
so
he
merely
said
know
very
well
that
i
ca
go
to
your
house
you
receive
a
lot
of
people
who
would
be
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
of
making
themselves
disagreeable
to
me
and
besides
i
do
want
to
mix
myself
up
with
politics
are
quite
mistaken
mouret
quite
mistaken
félicité
replied
is
not
a
club
i
would
never
allow
it
to
become
one
all
the
town
knows
that
i
do
all
i
can
to
make
my
house
as
pleasant
as
possible
and
if
political
matters
ever
are
discussed
there
it
is
only
in
corners
i
assure
you
ah
believe
me
i
had
quite
enough
of
politics
long
ago
what
makes
you
say
such
a
thing
you
receive
all
the
set
mouret
said
shortly
set
she
repeated
set
certainly
i
receive
those
gentlemen
but
i
do
think
that
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
will
be
found
very
often
in
my
house
this
winter
my
husband
has
told
him
pretty
plainly
what
he
thought
of
his
conduct
in
connection
with
the
last
elections
he
allowed
himself
to
be
tricked
like
a
mere
nincompoop
but
his
friends
are
very
pleasant
men
monsieur
delangre
and
monsieur
de
condamin
are
extremely
amiable
and
that
worthy
paloque
is
kindness
itself
while
i
sure
you
can
have
nothing
to
say
against
doctor
porquier
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
continued
with
ironic
emphasis
also
receive
monsieur
rastoil
circle
worthy
monsieur
maffre
and
our
clever
friend
monsieur
de
bourdeu
the
former
prefect
so
you
see
we
are
not
at
all
bigoted
or
exclusive
the
representatives
of
all
opinions
find
a
welcome
among
us
of
course
when
i
am
inviting
a
party
of
people
i
do
ask
those
to
meet
each
other
who
would
be
likely
to
quarrel
but
wit
and
cleverness
are
welcome
in
whomsoever
they
are
found
and
we
pride
ourselves
upon
having
at
our
gatherings
all
the
most
distinguished
persons
in
plassans
my
is
neutral
ground
remember
that
mouret
yes
neutral
ground
that
is
the
right
expression
she
had
grown
quite
animated
whilst
talking
her
was
her
great
glory
and
it
was
her
desire
to
reign
there
not
as
a
chief
of
a
party
but
as
a
queen
of
society
it
is
true
that
her
friends
said
that
she
was
adopting
conciliatory
tactics
merely
in
conformity
with
the
advice
of
her
son
eugène
the
minister
who
had
charged
her
to
personify
at
plassans
the
gentleness
and
amiability
of
the
empire
may
say
what
you
like
mouret
growled
that
maffre
of
yours
is
a
bigot
and
your
bourdeu
is
a
fool
and
most
of
all
the
others
are
a
pack
of
rascals
that
my
opinion
of
them
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
invitation
but
it
would
disturb
my
habits
too
much
to
accept
it
i
like
to
go
to
bed
in
good
time
and
i
prefer
stopping
at
home
félicité
rose
from
her
seat
and
turning
her
back
upon
mouret
she
said
to
her
daughter
at
any
rate
i
may
expect
you
may
i
my
dear
course
you
may
replied
marthe
who
wished
to
soften
the
bluntness
of
her
husband
blunt
refusal
the
old
lady
was
just
going
to
leave
when
a
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
and
she
asked
if
she
might
kiss
désirée
whom
she
had
seen
playing
in
the
garden
she
would
not
let
them
call
the
girl
into
the
house
but
insisted
on
going
herself
to
the
terrace
which
was
still
damp
from
a
slight
shower
which
had
fallen
in
the
morning
when
she
found
désirée
she
was
profuse
in
her
caresses
of
the
girl
who
seemed
rather
frightened
of
her
then
she
raised
her
head
as
if
by
chance
and
looked
at
the
curtains
at
the
windows
you
have
let
the
rooms
then
oh
yes
i
remember
now
to
a
priest
is
it
i
heard
it
spoken
of
what
sort
of
a
person
is
he
this
priest
of
yours
mouret
looked
at
her
keenly
a
sudden
suspicion
flashed
through
his
mind
and
he
began
to
guess
that
it
was
entirely
on
account
of
abbé
faujas
that
his
had
favoured
them
with
this
visit
my
word
he
replied
without
taking
his
eyes
off
her
really
know
nothing
about
him
but
perhaps
you
are
able
to
give
me
some
information
concerning
him
yourself
she
cried
with
an
appearance
of
great
surprise
never
even
seen
him
stay
though
i
know
he
is
one
of
the
curates
at
father
bourrette
told
me
that
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
that
i
ought
to
ask
him
to
my
thursdays
the
director
of
the
seminary
and
the
bishop
secretary
are
already
amongst
my
circle
of
visitors
and
turning
to
marthe
she
added
you
see
your
lodger
you
might
sound
him
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
me
whether
an
invitation
from
me
would
be
acceptable
scarcely
ever
see
him
mouret
hastily
interposed
comes
in
and
goes
out
without
ever
opening
his
mouth
and
besides
it
is
really
no
business
of
ours
he
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
suspiciously
upon
her
he
felt
quite
sure
that
she
knew
much
more
about
abbé
faujas
than
she
was
willing
to
admit
however
she
did
not
once
flinch
beneath
his
searching
gaze
well
it
all
the
same
to
me
she
said
with
an
appearance
of
unconcern
shall
be
able
to
find
out
some
other
way
of
inviting
him
if
he
the
right
sort
of
person
i
no
doubt
my
children
as
she
was
mounting
the
steps
again
a
tall
old
man
appeared
on
the
hall
threshold
he
was
dressed
very
neatly
in
blue
cloth
and
had
a
fur
cap
pressed
over
his
eyes
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
whip
why
there
uncle
macquart
cried
mouret
casting
a
curious
glance
at
his
an
expression
of
extreme
annoyance
passed
over
félicité
face
macquart
rougon
illegitimate
brother
had
by
the
latter
aid
returned
to
france
after
he
had
compromised
himself
in
the
rising
of
since
arriving
from
piedmont
he
had
been
leading
the
life
of
a
sleek
and
citizen
he
had
purchased
though
where
the
money
had
come
from
no
one
knew
a
small
house
at
the
village
of
les
tulettes
about
three
leagues
from
plassans
and
by
degrees
he
had
fitted
up
an
establishment
there
and
had
now
even
become
possessed
of
a
horse
and
trap
and
was
constantly
to
be
met
on
the
high
roads
smoking
his
pipe
enjoying
the
sunshine
and
sniggering
like
a
tamed
wolf
rougon
enemies
whispered
that
the
two
brothers
had
perpetrated
some
black
business
together
and
that
pierre
rougon
was
keeping
antoine
macquart
day
uncle
said
mouret
affectedly
you
come
to
pay
us
a
little
visit
indeed
macquart
replied
in
a
voice
as
guileless
as
a
child
know
that
whenever
i
come
to
plassans
hallo
félicité
i
expect
to
find
you
here
i
came
over
to
see
rougon
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
was
at
home
was
he
she
exclaimed
with
uneasy
haste
he
was
at
home
uncle
macquart
replied
tranquilly
saw
him
and
we
had
a
talk
together
he
is
a
good
fellow
is
rougon
he
laughed
slightly
and
while
félicité
stamped
her
feet
with
restless
anxiety
he
went
on
talking
in
his
drawling
voice
which
made
it
seem
as
if
he
was
always
laughing
at
those
whom
he
addressed
my
boy
i
have
brought
you
a
couple
of
rabbits
he
said
are
in
a
basket
over
there
i
have
given
them
to
rose
i
brought
another
couple
with
me
for
rougon
you
will
find
them
at
home
félicité
and
you
must
tell
me
how
they
turn
out
they
are
beautifully
plump
i
fattened
them
up
for
you
ah
my
dears
it
pleases
me
very
much
to
be
able
to
make
you
these
little
presents
félicité
turned
quite
pale
and
pressed
her
lips
tightly
while
mouret
continued
to
look
at
her
with
a
quiet
smile
she
would
have
been
glad
to
get
away
if
she
had
not
been
afraid
of
macquart
gossiping
as
soon
as
her
back
should
be
turned
you
uncle
said
mouret
plums
that
you
brought
us
the
last
time
you
came
were
very
good
wo
you
have
something
to
drink
that
an
offer
i
really
ca
refuse
when
rose
had
brought
him
out
a
glass
of
wine
he
sat
down
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
and
slowly
sipped
the
beverage
smacking
his
tongue
and
holding
up
the
glass
to
the
light
comes
from
the
district
of
he
said
not
to
be
deceived
in
matters
of
this
kind
i
know
the
different
districts
thoroughly
he
wagged
his
head
and
again
sniggered
then
mouret
with
an
intonation
that
was
full
of
meaning
suddenly
asked
him
how
are
things
getting
on
at
les
tulettes
macquart
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
all
then
giving
a
final
cluck
of
his
tongue
and
putting
down
the
glass
on
the
by
his
side
he
said
quite
unconcernedly
very
well
i
heard
of
her
the
day
before
yesterday
she
is
still
just
the
same
félicité
had
turned
her
head
away
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
mouret
had
just
put
his
finger
upon
one
of
the
family
sore
places
by
alluding
to
old
adelaide
the
mother
of
rougon
and
macquart
who
for
several
years
now
had
been
shut
up
as
a
mad
woman
in
the
asylum
at
les
tulettes
macquart
little
property
was
near
the
and
it
seemed
as
though
rougon
had
posted
the
old
scamp
there
to
keep
watch
over
their
mother
is
getting
late
macquart
said
at
last
rising
from
his
seat
on
the
balustrade
i
want
to
get
back
again
before
night
i
shall
expect
to
see
you
over
at
my
house
one
of
these
days
mouret
my
boy
you
have
promised
me
several
times
to
come
you
know
yes
i
come
uncle
i
come
but
that
is
enough
i
want
you
all
to
come
all
of
you
do
you
hear
i
am
very
dull
out
there
all
by
myself
i
will
give
you
some
dinner
then
turning
to
félicité
he
added
rougon
that
i
shall
expect
him
and
you
too
you
need
stop
from
coming
just
because
the
old
mother
happens
to
be
near
there
she
is
going
on
very
well
i
tell
you
and
is
properly
looked
after
you
may
safely
trust
yourselves
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
some
wine
from
one
of
the
slopes
of
la
seille
a
light
wine
that
will
warm
you
up
famously
he
began
to
walk
towards
the
gate
as
he
spoke
félicité
followed
him
so
closely
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
were
pushing
him
out
of
the
garden
they
all
accompanied
him
to
the
street
while
he
was
untethering
his
horse
which
he
had
fastened
by
the
reins
to
one
of
the
house
shutters
abbé
faujas
who
was
just
returning
home
passed
the
group
with
a
slight
bow
he
glided
on
as
noiselessly
as
a
black
shadow
but
félicité
quickly
turned
and
watched
him
till
he
reached
the
staircase
unfortunately
she
had
not
had
time
to
catch
sight
of
his
face
macquart
on
perceiving
the
priest
had
shaken
his
head
in
utter
surprise
my
boy
said
he
you
really
got
priests
lodging
with
you
now
that
man
has
very
strange
eyes
take
care
take
care
cassocks
bring
ill
luck
with
them
then
he
took
his
seat
in
his
trap
and
clucked
his
horse
on
going
down
the
rue
balande
at
a
gentle
trot
his
round
back
and
fur
cap
disappeared
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
taravelle
as
mouret
turned
round
again
he
heard
his
speaking
to
marthe
would
rather
you
do
it
she
was
saying
invitation
would
seem
less
formal
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
find
some
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
she
checked
herself
when
she
saw
that
she
was
overheard
and
having
kissed
désirée
effusively
she
went
away
giving
a
last
look
round
to
make
quite
sure
that
macquart
was
not
likely
to
come
back
to
gossip
about
her
forbid
you
to
mix
yourself
up
in
your
mother
affairs
you
know
mouret
said
to
his
wife
as
they
returned
into
the
house
has
always
got
some
business
or
other
on
hand
that
no
body
can
understand
what
in
the
world
can
she
want
with
the
abbé
she
would
invite
him
for
his
own
sake
i
sure
she
must
have
some
secret
reason
for
doing
so
that
priest
has
come
from
besançon
to
plassans
for
nothing
there
is
some
mystery
or
other
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
marthe
had
again
set
to
work
at
the
everlasting
repairs
of
the
which
kept
her
busy
for
days
together
but
her
husband
went
on
chattering
macquart
and
your
mother
amuse
me
very
much
how
they
hate
each
other
did
you
notice
how
angry
she
was
when
she
saw
him
come
she
always
seems
to
be
in
a
state
of
fear
lest
he
should
make
some
unpleasant
revelation
i
dare
say
that
he
willingly
do
so
but
they
never
catch
me
in
his
house
i
sworn
to
keep
clear
of
all
that
business
my
father
was
quite
right
when
he
said
that
my
family
those
rougons
and
macquarts
were
not
worth
a
rope
to
hang
them
with
they
are
my
relations
as
well
as
yours
so
you
feel
hurt
at
what
i
am
saying
i
say
it
because
it
is
true
they
are
wealthy
people
now
but
their
money
has
made
them
any
better
rather
the
contrary
then
he
set
off
to
take
a
turn
along
the
cours
sauvaire
where
he
met
his
friends
and
talked
to
them
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
the
events
of
the
previous
day
an
extensive
transaction
in
almonds
which
he
undertook
on
the
morrow
kept
him
busy
for
more
than
a
week
and
made
him
almost
forget
all
about
abbé
faujas
he
was
beginning
besides
to
feel
a
little
weary
of
the
abbé
who
did
not
talk
enough
and
was
far
too
secretive
on
two
separate
occasions
he
purposely
avoided
him
imagining
that
the
priest
only
wanted
to
see
him
in
order
to
make
him
relate
the
stories
of
the
remainder
of
the
circle
and
monsieur
rastoil
friends
rose
had
informed
him
that
madame
faujas
had
tried
to
get
her
to
talk
and
this
had
made
him
vow
that
he
would
in
future
keep
his
mouth
shut
this
resolve
furnished
fresh
amusement
for
his
idle
hours
and
now
as
he
looked
up
at
the
closely
drawn
curtains
of
the
windows
he
would
mutter
right
my
good
fellow
hide
yourself
as
much
as
you
like
i
know
very
well
that
you
watching
me
from
behind
those
curtains
but
you
wo
be
much
the
wiser
for
your
trouble
and
you
find
yourself
much
mistaken
if
you
expect
to
get
any
more
information
out
of
me
about
our
neighbours
he
derived
great
pleasure
from
the
thought
that
the
abbé
faujas
was
secretly
watching
and
he
took
every
precaution
to
avoid
falling
into
any
trap
that
might
be
laid
for
him
one
evening
as
he
was
coming
home
he
saw
abbé
bourrette
and
abbé
faujas
standing
before
monsieur
rastoil
gate
so
he
concealed
himself
behind
the
corner
of
a
house
and
spied
on
them
the
two
priests
kept
him
waiting
there
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
talked
with
great
animation
parted
for
a
moment
and
then
joined
each
other
again
and
resumed
their
conversation
mouret
thought
he
could
detect
that
abbé
bourrette
was
trying
to
persuade
abbé
faujas
to
accompany
him
to
the
judge
and
that
faujas
was
making
excuses
for
not
going
and
at
last
refusing
to
do
so
with
some
show
of
impatience
it
was
a
tuesday
the
day
of
the
weekly
dinner
finally
bourrette
entered
monsieur
rastoil
house
and
faujas
went
off
in
his
quiet
fashion
to
his
own
rooms
mouret
stood
for
awhile
thinking
what
could
be
abbé
faujas
reason
for
refusing
to
go
to
monsieur
rastoil
all
the
clergy
of
dined
there
abbé
fenil
abbé
surin
and
all
the
others
there
was
not
a
single
priest
in
plassans
who
had
not
enjoyed
the
fresh
air
by
the
fountain
in
the
garden
there
the
new
curate
refusal
to
go
seemed
a
very
extraordinary
thing
when
mouret
got
home
again
he
hurried
to
the
bottom
of
his
own
garden
to
reconnoitre
the
windows
and
after
a
moment
or
two
he
saw
the
curtain
of
the
second
window
move
to
the
right
he
felt
quite
sure
that
abbé
faujas
was
behind
it
spying
upon
what
might
be
going
on
at
monsieur
rastoil
then
mouret
thought
that
he
could
discover
by
certain
movements
of
the
curtain
that
the
abbé
was
in
turn
inspecting
the
gardens
of
the
the
next
day
a
wednesday
rose
told
him
just
as
he
was
going
out
that
abbé
bourrette
had
been
with
the
people
for
at
least
an
hour
upon
this
he
came
back
into
the
house
and
began
to
rummage
about
in
the
when
marthe
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
for
he
replied
sharply
that
he
was
trying
to
find
a
paper
without
which
he
could
not
go
out
he
even
went
upstairs
as
if
to
see
whether
he
had
left
it
there
after
waiting
for
a
long
time
behind
his
bedroom
door
he
thought
he
could
hear
some
chairs
moving
on
the
second
floor
and
thereupon
he
slowly
went
downstairs
stopping
for
a
moment
or
two
in
the
hall
to
give
abbé
bourrette
time
to
catch
him
up
is
that
you
monsieur
this
is
a
fortunate
meeting
you
are
going
to
i
suppose
and
i
am
going
that
way
too
we
will
keep
each
other
company
if
you
have
no
objection
abbé
bourrette
replied
that
he
would
be
delighted
and
they
both
walked
slowly
up
the
rue
balande
towards
the
place
of
the
the
abbé
was
a
stout
man
with
an
honest
open
face
and
big
blue
eyes
his
wide
silk
girdle
which
was
drawn
tightly
round
him
threw
his
stomach
into
relief
his
arms
were
unduly
short
and
his
legs
heavy
and
clumsy
and
he
walked
with
his
head
thrown
slightly
back
you
just
been
to
see
our
good
monsieur
faujas
said
mouret
going
to
the
point
at
once
must
really
thank
you
for
having
procured
me
such
a
lodger
as
is
rarely
to
be
found
yes
said
the
priest
is
a
very
good
and
worthy
man
never
makes
the
slightest
noise
and
we
ca
really
tell
that
there
is
anyone
in
the
house
and
he
is
so
polite
and
courteous
too
i
heard
it
said
do
you
know
that
he
is
a
man
of
unusual
attainments
and
that
he
has
been
sent
here
as
a
sort
of
compliment
to
the
diocese
they
had
now
reached
the
middle
of
the
place
of
the
mouret
stopped
short
and
looked
at
abbé
bourrette
keenly
indeed
the
priest
merely
replied
with
an
air
of
astonishment
i
been
told
the
bishop
it
is
said
intends
to
do
something
for
him
later
on
in
the
meantime
the
new
curate
has
to
keep
himself
in
the
background
for
fear
of
exciting
jealousy
abbé
bourrette
went
on
walking
again
and
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
surprise
me
very
much
he
quietly
remarked
is
a
very
unassuming
man
in
fact
he
is
far
too
humble
for
instance
at
the
church
he
has
taken
upon
himself
the
petty
duties
which
are
generally
left
to
the
ordinary
staff
he
is
a
saint
but
he
is
not
very
sharp
i
scarcely
ever
see
him
at
the
bishop
and
from
the
first
he
has
always
been
very
cold
with
abbé
fenil
though
i
strongly
impressed
upon
him
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
be
on
good
terms
with
the
if
he
wished
to
be
well
received
at
the
bishop
but
he
did
seem
to
see
it
and
i
afraid
that
he
deficient
in
judgment
he
shows
the
same
failing
too
by
his
continual
visits
to
abbé
compan
who
has
been
confined
to
his
bed
for
the
last
fortnight
and
whom
i
afraid
we
are
going
to
lose
abbé
faujas
visits
are
most
and
will
do
him
a
deal
of
harm
compan
has
always
been
on
bad
terms
with
fenil
and
it
only
a
stranger
from
besançon
who
could
be
ignorant
of
a
fact
that
is
known
to
the
whole
diocese
bourrette
was
growing
animated
and
in
his
turn
he
stopped
short
as
they
reached
the
rue
canquoin
and
took
his
stand
in
front
of
mouret
no
my
dear
sir
he
said
have
been
misinformed
faujas
is
as
simple
as
a
babe
i
not
an
ambitious
man
myself
and
god
knows
how
fond
i
am
of
compan
who
has
a
heart
of
gold
but
all
the
same
i
keep
my
visits
to
him
private
he
said
to
me
himself
bourrette
my
old
friend
i
am
not
much
longer
for
this
world
if
you
want
to
succeed
me
do
be
seen
too
often
knocking
at
my
door
come
after
dark
and
knock
three
times
and
my
sister
will
let
you
in
so
now
you
understand
i
wait
till
night
before
i
go
to
see
him
one
has
plenty
of
troubles
as
it
is
without
incurring
unnecessary
ones
his
voice
quavered
and
he
clasped
his
hands
across
his
stomach
as
he
resumed
his
walk
moved
by
a
naïve
egotism
which
made
him
commiserate
himself
while
he
murmured
compan
poor
compan
mouret
was
feeling
quite
perplexed
all
his
theories
about
abbé
faujas
were
being
upset
had
such
very
precise
details
furnished
to
me
he
ventured
to
say
was
told
that
he
was
to
be
promoted
to
some
important
office
dear
no
cried
the
priest
can
assure
you
that
there
is
no
truth
in
anything
of
the
kind
faujas
has
no
expectations
of
any
sort
i
tell
you
something
that
proves
it
you
know
that
i
dine
at
the
presiding
judge
every
tuesday
well
last
week
he
particularly
asked
me
to
bring
faujas
with
me
he
wanted
to
see
him
and
find
out
what
sort
of
a
person
he
was
i
suppose
now
you
would
scarcely
guess
what
faujas
did
he
refused
the
invitation
my
dear
sir
bluntly
refused
it
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
that
i
told
him
he
would
make
his
life
at
plassans
quite
intolerable
and
would
certainly
embroil
himself
with
fenil
by
acting
so
rudely
to
monsieur
rastoil
he
persisted
in
having
his
own
way
and
would
be
persuaded
by
anything
that
i
said
i
believe
that
he
even
exclaimed
in
a
moment
of
anger
that
he
reduced
to
accepting
dinners
of
that
kind
abbé
bourrette
began
to
smile
they
had
now
reached
and
he
detained
mouret
for
a
moment
near
the
little
side
door
of
the
church
is
a
child
a
big
child
he
continued
ask
you
now
could
a
dinner
at
monsieur
rastoil
possibly
compromise
him
in
any
way
when
your
that
good
madame
rougon
entrusted
me
yesterday
with
an
invitation
for
faujas
i
did
not
conceal
from
her
my
fear
that
it
would
be
badly
received
mouret
pricked
up
his
ears
my
gave
you
an
invitation
for
him
did
she
she
came
to
the
sacristy
yesterday
as
i
make
a
point
of
doing
what
i
can
to
oblige
her
i
promised
her
that
i
would
go
and
see
the
obstinate
man
this
morning
i
felt
quite
certain
however
that
he
would
refuse
did
he
indeed
much
to
my
surprise
he
accepted
mouret
opened
his
lips
and
then
closed
them
again
without
speaking
the
priest
winked
with
an
appearance
of
extreme
satisfaction
had
to
manage
the
matter
very
skilfully
you
know
for
more
than
an
hour
i
went
on
explaining
your
position
to
him
he
kept
shaking
his
head
however
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
and
he
was
ever
dwelling
upon
his
desire
for
privacy
i
had
exhausted
my
stock
of
arguments
when
i
recalled
one
point
of
the
instructions
which
the
dear
lady
gave
me
she
had
told
me
to
tell
him
that
her
was
entirely
neutral
ground
and
that
this
was
a
fact
well
known
to
the
whole
town
when
i
pressed
this
upon
his
notice
he
seemed
to
waver
and
at
last
he
consented
to
accept
the
invitation
and
even
promised
to
go
i
shall
send
a
few
lines
to
that
excellent
madame
rougon
to
inform
her
of
my
success
he
lingered
for
a
moment
longer
rolling
his
big
blue
eyes
and
saying
more
to
himself
than
to
mouret
rastoil
will
be
very
much
vexed
but
it
no
fault
of
mine
then
he
added
dear
monsieur
mouret
remember
me
very
kindly
to
all
your
family
he
entered
the
church
letting
the
padded
doors
close
softly
behind
him
mouret
gazed
at
the
doors
and
lightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
fine
old
chatterbox
he
muttered
of
those
men
who
never
give
one
a
chance
of
getting
in
a
word
but
go
on
chattering
away
for
hours
without
ever
telling
one
anything
worth
listening
to
so
faujas
is
going
to
félicité
it
really
very
provoking
that
i
am
not
on
good
terms
with
that
fool
rougon
all
the
afternoon
he
was
occupied
with
business
matters
but
at
night
just
as
he
and
his
wife
were
going
to
bed
he
said
to
marthe
carelessly
you
going
to
your
mother
evening
not
marthe
replied
have
too
many
things
to
do
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
go
next
week
he
made
no
immediate
reply
but
just
before
he
blew
out
the
candle
he
resumed
is
wrong
not
to
go
out
oftener
than
you
do
go
to
your
evening
it
will
enliven
you
a
little
i
will
stay
at
home
and
look
after
the
children
marthe
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
he
generally
kept
her
at
home
with
him
requiring
all
kinds
of
little
services
from
her
and
grumbling
if
she
went
out
even
for
an
hour
well
she
replied
will
go
if
you
wish
me
to
then
he
blew
out
the
candle
laid
his
head
upon
the
pillow
and
muttered
right
and
you
can
tell
us
all
about
it
when
you
come
back
it
will
amuse
the
children
vi
about
nine
on
the
following
evening
abbé
bourrette
called
for
abbé
faujas
he
had
promised
to
go
with
him
to
the
rougons
and
introduce
him
there
he
found
him
ready
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
big
bare
room
and
putting
on
a
pair
of
black
gloves
that
were
sadly
whitened
at
the
bourrette
could
not
restrain
a
slight
grimace
as
he
looked
at
him
you
got
another
cassock
he
asked
quietly
replied
abbé
faujas
one
is
still
very
decent
i
think
certainly
certainly
stammered
the
old
priest
it
very
cold
outside
had
you
better
put
something
round
your
shoulders
well
well
come
along
then
the
nights
had
just
commenced
to
be
frosty
abbé
bourrette
who
was
warmly
wrapped
in
a
padded
silk
overcoat
got
quite
out
of
breath
as
he
panted
along
after
abbé
faujas
who
wore
nothing
over
his
shoulders
but
his
thin
threadbare
cassock
they
stopped
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
and
the
place
of
the
in
front
of
a
house
built
entirely
of
white
stone
one
of
the
handsome
mansions
of
the
new
part
of
the
town
a
servant
in
blue
livery
received
them
at
the
door
and
ushered
them
into
the
hall
he
smiled
at
abbé
bourrette
as
he
helped
him
to
take
off
his
overcoat
and
seemed
greatly
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
other
priest
that
tall
man
who
had
ventured
out
on
such
a
bitter
night
without
a
cloak
the
was
on
the
first
floor
and
abbé
faujas
entered
it
with
head
erect
and
grave
though
perfectly
easy
demeanour
while
abbé
bourrette
who
was
always
very
nervous
when
he
went
to
the
rougons
house
although
he
never
missed
a
single
one
of
their
receptions
made
his
escape
into
an
adjoining
apartment
thus
cowardly
leaving
his
companion
in
the
lurch
faujas
however
slowly
traversed
the
whole
in
order
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
whom
he
felt
sure
he
could
recognise
among
a
group
of
five
or
six
ladies
he
was
obliged
to
introduce
himself
and
he
did
so
in
two
or
three
words
félicité
had
immediately
risen
from
her
seat
and
she
closely
if
quickly
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
then
her
eyes
sought
his
own
as
she
smilingly
said
am
delighted
monsieur
i
am
delighted
indeed
the
priest
passage
through
the
had
created
considerable
sensation
one
young
lady
who
had
suddenly
raised
her
head
had
quite
trembled
with
alarm
at
the
sight
of
that
great
black
mass
in
front
of
her
the
impression
created
by
the
abbé
was
indeed
an
unfavourable
one
he
was
too
tall
too
his
face
was
too
hard
and
his
hands
were
too
big
his
cassock
moreover
looked
so
frightfully
shabby
beneath
the
bright
light
of
the
chandelier
that
the
ladies
felt
a
kind
of
shame
at
seeing
a
priest
so
shockingly
dressed
they
spread
out
their
fans
and
began
to
giggle
behind
them
while
pretending
to
be
quite
unconscious
of
the
abbé
presence
the
men
meantime
exchanged
very
significant
glances
félicité
saw
what
a
very
churlish
welcome
the
priest
was
receiving
she
seemed
annoyed
at
it
and
remained
standing
raising
her
voice
in
order
to
force
her
guests
to
hear
the
compliments
which
she
addressed
to
faujas
dear
bourrette
said
she
in
her
most
winning
tone
told
me
what
difficulty
he
had
in
persuading
you
to
come
i
am
really
quite
cross
with
you
sir
you
have
no
right
to
deprive
society
of
the
pleasure
of
your
company
the
priest
bowed
without
making
any
reply
and
the
old
lady
laughed
as
she
began
to
speak
again
laying
a
meaning
emphasis
on
certain
of
her
words
know
more
about
you
than
you
imagine
in
spite
of
all
the
care
you
have
taken
to
hide
your
light
under
a
bushel
i
have
been
told
about
you
you
are
a
very
holy
man
and
i
want
to
be
your
friend
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
this
for
i
hope
that
you
will
now
consider
yourself
as
one
of
our
circle
abbé
faujas
looked
at
her
fixedly
as
though
he
had
recognised
some
masonic
sign
in
the
movements
of
her
fan
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
replied
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
said
madame
rougon
with
another
laugh
will
find
that
we
do
our
best
here
to
make
everyone
happy
but
come
with
me
and
let
me
present
you
to
my
husband
she
crossed
the
room
disturbing
several
of
her
guests
in
her
progress
to
make
way
for
abbé
faujas
thus
giving
him
an
importance
which
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
prejudice
against
him
in
the
adjoining
room
some
were
set
out
she
went
straight
up
to
her
husband
who
was
gravely
playing
whist
he
seemed
rather
impatient
as
she
stooped
down
to
whisper
in
his
ear
but
the
few
words
she
said
to
him
made
him
spring
briskly
from
his
seat
good
very
good
he
murmured
then
having
first
apologised
to
those
with
whom
he
was
playing
he
went
and
shook
hands
with
abbé
faujas
at
that
time
rougon
was
a
stout
pale
man
of
seventy
and
had
acquired
all
a
millionaire
gravity
of
expression
he
was
generally
considered
by
the
plassans
people
to
have
a
fine
head
the
white
uncommunicative
head
of
a
man
of
political
importance
after
he
had
exchanged
a
few
courtesies
with
the
priest
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
félicité
had
just
gone
back
into
the
her
face
still
wreathed
with
smiles
when
abbé
faujas
at
last
found
himself
alone
he
did
not
manifest
the
slightest
sign
of
embarrassment
he
remained
for
a
moment
watching
the
or
appearing
to
do
so
for
he
was
in
reality
examining
the
curtains
and
carpet
and
furniture
it
was
a
small
wainscotted
room
and
of
dark
wood
ornamented
with
brass
beadings
occupied
three
of
its
sides
it
looked
like
a
private
sanctum
at
last
the
priest
who
was
apparently
desirous
of
making
a
complete
inspection
returned
to
the
and
crossed
it
it
was
hung
with
green
and
was
in
keeping
with
the
smaller
but
there
was
more
gilding
about
it
so
that
it
suggested
the
soberness
of
a
minister
private
room
combined
with
the
brightness
of
a
great
restaurant
on
the
other
side
of
it
was
a
sort
of
boudoir
where
félicité
received
her
friends
during
the
day
this
was
hung
in
straw
colour
and
was
so
full
of
and
ottomans
and
couches
covered
with
brocade
with
a
pattern
of
violet
that
there
was
scarcely
room
to
move
about
in
it
abbé
faujas
took
a
seat
near
the
fireplace
and
pretended
to
be
warming
his
feet
he
had
placed
himself
in
such
a
position
that
through
the
open
doorway
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
greater
part
of
the
large
he
reflected
upon
madame
rougon
gracious
reception
and
half
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
thinking
out
some
problem
which
it
was
rather
difficult
to
solve
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
while
he
was
still
absorbed
in
his
reverie
he
heard
someone
speaking
behind
him
his
concealed
him
from
sight
and
he
kept
his
eyes
still
more
tightly
closed
than
before
as
he
remained
there
listening
looking
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
warmth
of
the
fire
had
sent
him
to
sleep
went
to
their
house
just
once
at
that
time
an
unctuous
voice
was
saying
were
then
living
opposite
this
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
you
were
at
paris
then
but
all
plassans
at
that
period
knew
of
the
rougons
yellow
a
wretched
room
it
was
hung
with
paper
at
fifteen
sous
the
piece
and
containing
some
rickety
furniture
covered
with
cheap
velvet
but
look
at
black
félicité
now
dressed
in
satin
and
seated
on
yonder
couch
do
you
see
how
she
gives
her
hand
to
little
delangre
upon
my
word
she
is
giving
it
to
him
to
kiss
then
a
younger
voice
said
with
something
of
a
sneer
must
have
managed
to
lay
their
hands
on
a
pretty
big
share
of
plunder
to
be
able
to
have
such
a
beautiful
it
is
the
handsomest
you
know
in
the
whole
town
lady
the
other
voice
resumed
always
had
a
passion
for
receptions
when
she
was
hard
up
she
drank
water
herself
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
provide
lemonade
for
her
guests
oh
i
know
all
about
the
rougons
i
have
watched
their
whole
career
they
are
very
clever
people
and
the
coup
has
enabled
them
to
satisfy
the
dreams
of
luxury
and
pleasure
which
had
been
tormenting
them
for
forty
years
now
you
see
what
a
magnificent
style
they
keep
up
how
lavishly
they
live
this
house
which
they
now
occupy
formerly
belonged
to
a
monsieur
peirotte
one
of
the
receivers
of
taxes
who
was
killed
in
the
affair
at
in
the
insurrection
of
upon
my
word
they
had
the
most
extraordinary
luck
a
stray
bullet
removed
the
man
who
was
standing
in
their
way
and
they
stepped
into
his
place
and
house
if
it
had
been
a
choice
between
the
receivership
and
the
house
félicité
would
certainly
have
chosen
the
house
she
had
been
hankering
after
it
for
half
a
score
years
nearly
making
herself
quite
ill
by
her
covetous
glances
at
the
magnificent
curtains
that
hung
at
the
windows
it
was
her
tuileries
as
the
plassans
people
used
to
say
after
the
of
december
where
did
they
get
the
money
to
buy
this
house
no
one
knows
that
my
dear
fellow
their
son
eugène
who
has
had
such
amazing
political
success
in
paris
and
has
become
a
deputy
a
minister
and
a
confidential
adviser
at
the
tuileries
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
receivership
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
for
his
father
who
had
played
his
cards
very
cleverly
here
as
for
the
house
they
probably
paid
for
it
by
borrowing
the
money
from
some
banker
anyhow
they
are
wealthy
people
and
are
fast
making
up
for
lost
time
i
fancy
their
son
keeps
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
them
for
they
have
not
made
a
single
false
step
as
yet
the
person
who
was
speaking
paused
for
a
moment
then
resumed
with
a
low
laugh
i
really
ca
help
laughing
when
i
see
that
precious
grasshopper
of
a
félicité
putting
on
all
her
fine
duchess
airs
i
always
think
of
the
old
yellow
with
its
threadbare
carpet
and
shabby
furniture
and
little
chandelier
and
now
she
receives
the
rastoil
young
ladies
just
look
how
she
is
manœuvring
the
train
of
her
dress
some
day
my
dear
fellow
that
old
woman
will
burst
of
sheer
triumph
in
the
middle
of
her
green
abbé
faujas
had
gently
let
his
head
turn
so
that
he
might
peep
at
what
was
going
on
in
the
there
he
observed
madame
rougon
standing
in
all
her
majesty
in
the
centre
of
a
group
of
guests
she
seemed
to
have
increased
in
stature
and
every
back
around
bent
before
her
glance
which
was
like
that
of
some
victorious
queen
here
your
father
said
the
person
with
the
unctuous
voice
good
doctor
is
just
arriving
i
quite
surprised
that
he
has
never
told
you
of
all
these
matters
he
knows
far
more
about
them
than
i
do
my
father
is
always
afraid
lest
i
should
compromise
him
replied
the
other
gaily
know
how
he
rails
at
me
and
swears
that
i
shall
make
him
lose
all
his
patients
ah
excuse
me
please
i
see
the
young
maffres
over
there
i
must
go
and
shake
hands
with
them
there
was
a
sound
of
chairs
being
moved
and
abbé
faujas
saw
a
tall
young
man
whose
face
already
bore
signs
of
physical
weariness
cross
the
small
room
the
other
person
the
one
who
had
given
such
a
lively
account
of
the
rougons
also
rose
from
his
seat
a
lady
who
happened
to
pass
near
him
allowed
him
to
pay
her
some
pretty
compliments
and
she
smiled
at
him
and
called
him
monsieur
de
condamin
thereupon
the
priest
recognised
him
as
the
fine
man
of
sixty
whom
mouret
had
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
garden
of
the
monsieur
de
condamin
came
and
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
he
was
startled
to
see
abbé
faujas
who
had
been
quite
concealed
by
the
back
of
his
chair
but
he
appeared
in
no
way
disconcerted
he
smiled
and
with
amicable
exclaimed
think
monsieur
that
we
have
just
been
unintentionally
confessing
ourselves
it
a
great
sin
is
it
to
backbite
neighbour
fortunately
you
were
there
to
give
us
absolution
the
abbé
in
spite
of
the
control
which
he
usually
had
over
his
features
could
not
restrain
a
slight
blush
he
perfectly
understood
that
monsieur
de
condamin
was
reproaching
him
for
having
kept
so
quiet
in
order
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
monsieur
de
condamin
however
was
not
a
man
to
preserve
a
grudge
against
anyone
for
their
curiosity
but
quite
the
contrary
he
was
delighted
at
the
complicity
which
the
matter
seemed
to
have
established
between
himself
and
the
abbé
it
put
him
at
liberty
to
talk
freely
and
to
while
away
the
evening
in
relating
scandalous
stories
about
the
persons
present
there
was
nothing
that
he
enjoyed
so
much
and
this
abbé
who
had
only
recently
arrived
at
plassans
seemed
likely
to
prove
a
good
listener
the
more
especially
as
he
had
an
ugly
face
the
face
of
a
man
who
would
listen
to
anything
and
wore
such
a
shabby
cassock
that
it
would
be
preposterous
to
think
that
any
confidence
to
which
he
might
be
treated
would
lead
to
unpleasantness
by
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
monsieur
de
condamin
became
quite
at
his
ease
and
gave
abbé
faujas
a
detailed
account
of
plassans
with
all
the
suave
politeness
of
a
man
of
the
world
are
a
stranger
amongst
us
monsieur
said
he
i
shall
be
delighted
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
plassans
is
a
little
hole
of
a
place
but
one
gets
reconciled
to
it
in
time
i
myself
come
from
the
neighbourhood
of
dijon
and
when
i
was
appointed
conservator
of
woods
and
rivers
in
this
district
i
found
the
place
detestable
and
thought
i
should
be
bored
to
death
here
that
was
just
before
the
empire
after
the
provinces
were
by
no
means
cheerful
places
to
live
in
i
assure
you
in
this
department
the
folks
were
alarmed
if
they
heard
a
dog
bark
and
they
were
ready
to
sink
into
the
ground
at
the
sight
of
a
gendarme
but
they
calmed
down
by
degrees
and
resumed
their
old
monotonous
uneventful
existences
and
in
the
end
i
grew
quite
resigned
to
my
life
here
i
live
chiefly
in
the
open
air
i
take
long
rides
on
horseback
and
i
have
made
a
few
pleasant
friendships
he
lowered
his
voice
and
continued
confidentially
you
will
take
my
advice
monsieur
you
will
be
careful
what
you
do
you
ca
imagine
what
a
scrape
i
once
nearly
fell
into
plassans
you
know
is
divided
into
three
absolutely
distinct
divisions
the
old
district
where
your
duties
will
be
confined
to
administering
consolation
and
alms
the
district
of
where
our
aristocrats
live
a
district
that
is
full
of
boredom
and
and
where
you
ca
be
too
much
upon
your
guard
and
lastly
the
new
town
the
district
which
is
now
springing
up
round
the
and
which
is
the
only
one
where
it
is
possible
to
live
with
any
degree
of
comfort
at
first
i
was
foolish
enough
to
take
up
my
quarters
in
the
district
where
i
thought
that
my
position
required
me
to
reside
there
alack
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
a
lot
of
withered
old
dowagers
and
mummified
marquises
there
was
an
atom
of
sociability
not
a
scrap
of
gaiety
nothing
but
sulky
mutiny
against
the
prosperous
peace
that
the
country
was
enjoying
i
only
just
missed
compromising
myself
upon
my
word
i
did
péqueur
used
to
chaff
me
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
our
you
know
him
you
well
then
i
crossed
the
cours
sauvaire
and
took
rooms
on
the
place
at
plassans
you
must
know
the
people
have
no
existence
and
the
aristocracy
are
a
dreadful
lot
that
it
quite
impossible
to
get
on
with
the
only
tolerable
folks
are
a
few
parvenus
some
delightful
persons
who
are
ready
to
incur
any
expense
in
entertaining
their
official
acquaintances
our
little
circle
of
functionaries
is
a
very
delightful
one
we
live
amongst
ourselves
after
our
own
inclinations
without
caring
a
rap
about
the
townspeople
just
as
if
we
had
pitched
our
camp
in
some
conquered
country
he
laughed
complacently
stretched
himself
further
back
in
his
chair
and
turned
up
his
feet
to
the
fire
then
he
took
a
glass
of
punch
from
a
tray
which
one
of
the
servants
handed
to
him
and
sipped
it
slowly
while
still
watching
abbé
faujas
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
latter
felt
that
politeness
required
him
to
say
something
house
seems
a
very
pleasant
one
he
remarked
turning
slightly
towards
the
green
whence
the
sound
of
animated
conversation
was
proceeding
yes
resumed
monsieur
de
condamin
who
checked
his
remarks
every
now
and
then
to
take
a
little
sip
of
punch
rougons
almost
make
us
forget
paris
you
would
scarcely
fancy
here
that
you
were
in
plassans
it
is
the
only
pleasant
and
amusing
in
the
whole
place
because
it
is
the
only
one
where
all
shades
of
opinion
elbow
one
another
péqueur
too
has
very
pleasant
assemblies
it
must
cost
the
rougons
a
lot
of
money
and
they
have
the
public
purse
behind
them
like
péqueur
has
though
they
have
something
better
still
the
pockets
of
the
taxpayers
he
seemed
quite
pleased
with
this
witticism
of
his
he
set
his
empty
glass
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
then
drawing
his
chair
near
to
abbé
faujas
and
leaning
towards
him
he
began
to
speak
again
most
amusing
comedies
are
continually
being
played
here
but
you
ought
to
know
the
actors
to
appreciate
them
you
see
madame
rastoil
over
yonder
between
her
two
daughters
that
lady
of
about
with
a
head
like
a
sheep
well
have
you
noticed
how
her
eyelids
trembled
and
blinked
when
delangre
came
and
sat
down
in
front
of
her
delangre
is
the
man
there
on
the
left
with
a
likeness
to
punch
they
were
acquainted
intimately
some
ten
years
ago
and
he
is
said
to
be
the
father
of
one
of
the
girls
but
it
is
known
which
the
funniest
part
of
the
business
is
that
delangre
himself
did
get
on
very
well
with
his
wife
about
the
same
time
and
people
say
that
the
father
of
his
daughter
is
an
artist
very
well
known
in
plassans
abbé
faujas
had
considered
it
his
duty
to
assume
a
very
serious
expression
on
being
made
the
recipient
of
such
confidences
as
these
and
he
even
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
hear
nothing
while
monsieur
de
condamin
went
on
as
though
in
justification
of
himself
allow
myself
to
speak
in
this
way
of
delangre
as
i
know
him
so
well
he
is
a
wonderfully
clever
pushing
fellow
his
father
was
a
bricklayer
i
believe
fifteen
years
ago
he
used
to
take
up
the
petty
suits
that
other
lawyers
would
be
bothered
with
madame
rastoil
extricated
him
from
a
condition
of
absolute
penury
she
supplied
him
even
with
wood
in
the
to
enable
him
to
keep
himself
warm
it
was
through
her
influence
that
he
won
his
first
cases
worth
mentioning
that
at
that
time
delangre
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
manifest
no
particular
political
proclivities
and
so
in
when
people
were
looking
out
for
a
mayor
his
name
was
at
once
thought
of
he
was
the
only
man
who
could
have
been
chosen
without
alarming
one
or
other
of
the
three
divisions
of
the
town
from
that
time
everything
has
prospered
with
him
and
he
has
a
fine
future
before
him
the
only
unfortunate
part
of
the
matter
is
that
he
does
get
on
very
well
with
péqueur
they
are
always
wrangling
about
some
silly
trifles
or
other
he
broke
off
as
he
saw
the
tall
young
man
with
whom
he
had
been
chatting
previously
come
up
to
him
again
guillaume
porquier
he
said
introducing
him
to
the
abbé
son
of
doctor
porquier
then
as
guillaume
seated
himself
he
asked
him
with
a
touch
of
irony
what
did
you
see
to
admire
over
yonder
at
all
indeed
replied
the
young
man
with
a
smile
saw
the
paloques
madame
rougon
always
tries
to
hide
them
behind
a
curtain
to
prevent
anything
unpleasant
happening
paloque
never
takes
his
eyes
off
monsieur
rastoil
hoping
no
doubt
to
kill
him
with
suppressed
terror
you
know
of
course
that
the
hideous
fellow
hopes
to
die
presiding
judge
they
both
laughed
the
ugliness
of
the
paloques
was
a
perpetual
source
of
amusement
amongst
the
little
circle
of
officials
porquier
son
lowered
his
voice
as
he
continued
saw
monsieur
bourdeu
too
does
it
strike
you
that
he
ever
so
much
thinner
since
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
election
bourdeu
will
never
get
over
the
loss
of
his
prefecture
he
had
put
all
his
orleanist
rancour
at
the
service
of
the
legitimists
in
the
hope
that
that
course
would
lead
him
straight
to
the
chamber
where
he
would
be
able
to
win
back
that
prefecture
so
he
was
horribly
disgusted
and
hurt
to
find
that
instead
of
himself
they
chose
the
marquis
who
is
a
perfect
ass
and
has
the
faintest
notion
of
politics
whereas
he
bourdeu
is
a
very
shrewd
fellow
bourdeu
with
his
and
hat
is
a
most
overbearing
person
said
monsieur
de
condamin
shrugging
his
shoulders
such
people
as
he
were
allowed
to
have
their
own
way
they
would
turn
france
into
a
mere
sorbonne
of
lawyers
and
diplomatists
and
would
bore
us
all
to
death
oh
by
the
way
guillaume
i
have
been
hearing
about
you
you
seem
to
be
leading
a
merry
sort
of
life
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
a
smile
you
my
fine
fellow
and
observe
that
i
get
my
information
from
your
father
he
is
much
distressed
about
it
he
accuses
you
of
gambling
and
of
staying
out
all
night
at
the
club
and
other
places
is
it
true
that
you
have
discovered
a
low
café
behind
the
gaol
where
you
go
with
a
company
of
scamps
and
play
the
devil
own
game
i
have
even
been
told
here
monsieur
de
condamin
observing
two
ladies
enter
the
room
began
to
whisper
in
guillaume
ear
while
the
young
man
replied
with
affirmative
signs
and
shook
with
suppressed
laughter
then
he
bent
forward
in
turn
and
whispered
to
monsieur
de
condamin
and
the
pair
of
them
drawing
close
together
with
brightly
glistening
eyes
seemed
to
derive
a
prolonged
enjoyment
from
this
private
story
which
could
not
be
told
in
the
presence
of
ladies
abbé
faujas
had
remained
where
he
was
he
no
longer
listened
to
what
was
being
said
but
watched
the
many
movements
of
monsieur
delangre
who
bustled
about
the
green
trying
to
make
himself
extremely
agreeable
the
priest
was
so
absorbed
in
his
observations
that
he
did
not
see
abbé
bourrette
beckoning
to
him
so
that
the
other
had
to
come
and
touch
his
shoulder
and
ask
him
to
follow
he
then
led
him
into
the
with
all
the
precaution
of
a
man
who
has
some
very
delicate
communication
to
make
dear
friend
he
whispered
when
they
were
alone
in
a
quiet
corner
is
excusable
in
you
as
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
been
here
but
i
must
warn
you
that
you
have
compromised
yourself
very
considerably
by
talking
so
long
with
the
persons
you
have
just
left
then
as
abbé
faujas
looked
at
him
with
great
surprise
he
added
persons
are
not
looked
upon
favourably
i
myself
am
not
passing
any
judgment
upon
them
and
i
do
want
to
repeat
any
scandal
i
am
simply
warning
you
out
of
pure
friendship
that
all
he
was
going
away
but
abbé
faujas
detained
him
exclaiming
hastily
disquiet
me
my
dear
monsieur
bourrette
i
beg
of
you
to
explain
yourself
without
speaking
any
ill
of
anyone
you
can
surely
be
a
little
clearer
then
replied
the
old
priest
after
a
momentary
hesitation
porquier
son
causes
his
worthy
father
the
greatest
distress
and
sets
the
worst
example
to
all
the
studious
youth
of
plassans
he
left
nothing
but
debts
behind
him
in
paris
and
here
he
is
turning
the
whole
town
upside
down
as
for
monsieur
de
condamin
here
he
hesitated
again
feeling
embarrassed
by
the
enormity
of
what
he
had
to
relate
then
lowering
his
eyes
he
resumed
de
condamin
is
very
free
in
his
conversation
and
i
fear
that
he
is
deficient
in
a
sense
of
morality
he
spares
no
one
and
he
scandalises
every
honourable
person
then
i
really
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
but
he
has
contracted
it
is
said
a
scarcely
creditable
marriage
you
see
that
young
woman
there
who
is
not
thirty
years
old
and
who
has
such
a
crowd
around
her
well
he
brought
her
to
plassans
one
day
from
no
one
knows
where
from
the
time
of
her
arrival
she
has
been
here
it
is
she
who
has
got
her
husband
and
doctor
porquier
decorated
she
has
influential
friends
in
paris
but
i
beg
of
you
not
to
repeat
any
of
this
madame
de
condamin
is
very
amiable
and
charitable
i
go
to
her
house
sometimes
and
i
should
be
extremely
distressed
if
i
thought
that
she
considered
me
an
enemy
of
hers
if
she
has
committed
faults
it
is
our
duty
is
it
not
to
help
her
to
return
to
a
better
way
of
life
as
for
her
husband
he
is
between
ourselves
a
perfect
scamp
have
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
him
abbé
faujas
gazed
into
the
worthy
bourrette
eyes
he
had
just
noticed
that
madame
rougon
was
following
their
conversation
from
the
distance
with
a
thoughtful
air
it
madame
rougon
who
told
you
to
come
and
give
me
this
good
advice
he
suddenly
asked
the
old
priest
did
you
know
that
the
latter
exclaimed
in
great
astonishment
asked
me
not
to
mention
her
name
but
since
you
have
guessed
it
ah
she
is
a
good
lady
who
would
be
much
distressed
to
see
a
priest
compromising
himself
in
her
house
she
is
unfortunately
compelled
to
receive
all
sorts
of
persons
abbé
faujas
expressed
his
thanks
and
promised
to
be
more
prudent
in
the
future
the
had
not
taken
any
notice
of
the
two
priests
who
returned
into
the
big
where
faujas
was
again
conscious
of
hostile
surroundings
he
even
experienced
greater
coldness
and
more
silent
contempt
than
before
the
ladies
pulled
their
dresses
out
of
his
way
as
though
his
touch
would
have
soiled
them
and
the
men
turned
away
from
him
with
sneering
titters
he
himself
maintained
haughty
calmness
and
indifference
fancying
that
he
heard
the
word
besançon
meaningly
pronounced
in
a
corner
of
the
room
where
madame
de
condamin
was
holding
her
court
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
folks
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
but
at
his
approach
there
was
a
dead
silence
amongst
them
and
they
all
stared
him
in
the
face
with
eyes
that
gleamed
with
uncharitable
curiosity
he
felt
quite
sure
that
they
had
been
talking
about
him
and
repeating
some
disgraceful
story
while
he
was
still
standing
there
behind
the
rastoil
young
ladies
who
had
not
observed
him
he
heard
the
younger
one
ask
her
sister
was
it
that
this
priest
of
whom
everyone
is
talking
did
at
besançon
do
quite
know
the
elder
sister
replied
believe
he
nearly
murdered
his
vicar
in
a
quarrel
they
had
papa
also
said
that
he
had
been
mixed
up
in
some
great
business
speculation
which
turned
out
badly
in
the
small
room
over
there
is
he
somebody
saw
him
just
now
laughing
with
monsieur
de
condamin
then
people
do
quite
right
to
distrust
him
if
he
laughs
with
monsieur
de
condamin
this
gossip
of
the
two
girls
made
perspiration
start
from
abbé
brows
he
did
not
frown
but
his
lips
tightened
one
upon
the
other
and
his
cheeks
took
an
ashy
tint
he
seemed
to
hear
the
whole
room
talking
of
the
priest
whom
he
had
tried
to
murder
and
of
the
shady
transactions
in
which
he
had
been
concerned
opposite
him
were
monsieur
delangre
and
doctor
porquier
still
looking
very
severe
monsieur
de
bourdeu
mouth
pouted
scornfully
as
he
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
a
lady
monsieur
maffre
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
casting
furtive
glances
at
him
as
if
he
had
piously
resolved
to
examine
him
from
a
distance
before
condemning
him
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
two
hideous
paloques
craned
out
their
faces
in
which
shone
a
wicked
joy
at
all
the
cruel
stories
that
were
being
whispered
about
abbé
faujas
slowly
retired
as
he
saw
madame
rastoil
who
had
been
standing
a
few
paces
away
come
up
and
seat
herself
between
her
two
daughters
as
though
to
keep
them
under
the
protection
of
her
wing
and
shield
them
from
his
touch
he
rested
his
elbow
on
the
piano
which
he
saw
behind
him
and
there
he
stood
with
his
head
erect
and
his
face
as
hard
and
silent
as
a
face
of
stone
he
felt
that
they
were
all
in
a
plot
to
treat
him
as
an
outcast
as
he
stood
thus
gazing
at
the
company
from
under
his
partially
lowered
eyelids
he
suddenly
gave
a
slight
start
which
he
quickly
suppressed
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
abbé
fenil
leaning
back
in
an
and
smiling
quietly
behind
a
perfect
wall
of
petticoats
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
and
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
some
moments
with
the
fierce
expression
of
duellists
about
to
engage
in
mortal
combat
then
there
was
a
rustling
of
silk
and
abbé
fenil
was
hidden
from
sight
by
the
ladies
gowns
however
félicité
had
contrived
to
reach
the
neighbourhood
of
the
piano
and
when
she
had
succeeded
in
installing
at
it
the
elder
of
the
rastoil
girls
who
had
a
pleasant
voice
and
was
able
to
speak
to
abbé
faujas
without
being
heard
she
drew
him
towards
one
of
the
windows
and
asked
have
you
done
to
abbé
fenil
they
talked
together
in
very
low
tones
the
priest
at
first
feigned
surprise
but
when
madame
rougon
had
murmured
a
few
words
accompanied
by
sundry
shruggings
of
her
shoulders
he
seemed
to
become
more
open
with
her
they
both
smiled
and
made
a
pretence
of
merely
exchanging
ordinary
courtesies
but
the
glistening
of
their
eyes
spoke
of
something
much
more
serious
the
piano
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
the
elder
mademoiselle
rastoil
began
to
sing
colombe
du
soldat
which
was
a
favourite
song
at
that
time
has
been
most
unfortunate
félicité
continued
have
quite
set
people
against
you
and
i
should
advise
you
not
to
come
here
again
for
a
considerable
time
you
must
make
yourself
popular
and
a
favourite
you
understand
any
rash
act
would
be
fatal
abbé
faujas
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
say
that
it
was
abbé
fenil
who
circulated
these
abominable
stories
he
asked
he
is
much
too
wily
to
commit
himself
in
such
a
way
he
must
just
have
faintly
suggested
them
to
his
penitents
i
do
know
whether
he
has
found
you
out
but
he
is
certainly
afraid
of
you
i
am
sure
of
that
and
he
will
attack
you
in
every
possible
way
the
most
unfortunate
part
of
the
matter
is
that
he
confesses
the
most
important
people
in
the
town
it
was
he
who
secured
the
election
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
did
wrong
to
come
this
evening
the
priest
murmured
félicité
bit
her
lips
then
continued
with
animation
did
wrong
to
compromise
yourself
with
such
a
man
as
that
condamin
i
did
what
i
thought
was
best
when
the
person
whom
you
know
of
wrote
to
me
from
paris
i
thought
that
i
should
be
doing
you
a
service
by
inviting
you
here
i
imagined
that
you
would
be
able
to
make
it
an
opportunity
for
gaining
friends
but
instead
of
doing
what
you
could
to
make
yourself
popular
you
have
set
everyone
against
you
please
excuse
my
freedom
but
you
really
seem
to
be
doing
all
you
can
to
ensure
your
failure
you
have
committed
nothing
but
mistakes
in
going
to
lodge
with
my
in
persistently
keeping
yourself
aloof
from
others
and
in
walking
about
in
a
cassock
which
makes
the
jeer
at
you
abbé
faujas
could
not
repress
a
movement
of
impatience
however
he
merely
replied
will
profit
by
your
kind
advice
only
do
try
to
assist
me
that
would
mar
everything
what
you
say
is
prudent
replied
the
old
lady
return
here
in
triumph
one
last
word
my
dear
sir
the
person
in
paris
is
most
anxious
for
your
success
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
am
interesting
myself
in
you
well
then
do
make
people
frightened
of
you
shun
you
be
pleasant
and
make
yourself
agreeable
to
the
ladies
remember
that
particularly
you
must
make
yourself
agreeable
to
the
ladies
if
you
want
to
get
plassans
on
your
side
the
elder
mademoiselle
rastoil
had
just
finished
her
song
with
a
final
flourish
and
the
guests
were
softly
applauding
her
madame
rougon
left
the
abbé
to
go
and
congratulate
the
singer
then
she
took
up
a
position
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
shook
hands
with
the
visitors
who
were
beginning
to
retire
it
was
eleven
the
abbé
was
much
vexed
to
find
that
the
worthy
bourrette
had
taken
advantage
of
the
music
to
effect
his
escape
he
had
thought
of
leaving
with
him
a
course
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
make
a
respectable
exit
now
however
he
would
have
to
go
away
alone
which
would
be
extremely
prejudicial
to
him
it
would
be
reported
through
the
town
in
the
morning
that
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
so
he
retired
into
a
whence
he
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
effect
an
honourable
retreat
the
room
was
emptying
fast
however
and
there
were
only
a
few
ladies
left
at
last
he
noticed
one
who
was
very
simply
dressed
it
was
madame
mouret
whose
slightly
waved
hair
made
her
look
younger
than
usual
he
looked
with
surprise
at
her
tranquil
face
and
her
large
peaceful
black
eyes
he
had
not
noticed
her
during
the
evening
she
had
quietly
remained
in
the
same
corner
without
moving
vexed
at
wasting
her
time
in
this
way
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
doing
nothing
while
he
was
looking
at
her
she
rose
to
take
leave
of
her
mother
it
was
one
of
félicité
greatest
delights
to
see
the
high
society
of
plassans
leave
her
with
profuse
bows
and
thanks
for
her
punch
her
green
and
the
pleasant
evening
they
had
spent
there
and
she
thought
how
formerly
these
same
fine
folks
had
trampled
her
underfoot
whereas
now
the
richest
amongst
them
could
not
find
sweet
enough
smiles
for
madame
rougon
madame
murmured
maffre
the
justice
of
the
peace
quite
forgets
the
passage
of
time
here
are
the
only
pleasant
hostess
in
all
this
uncivilised
place
whispered
pretty
madame
de
condamin
shall
expect
you
to
dinner
said
monsieur
delangre
you
must
take
for
we
do
pretend
to
do
as
you
do
marthe
was
obliged
to
make
her
way
through
all
this
crowd
in
order
to
reach
her
mother
she
kissed
her
and
was
about
to
retire
when
félicité
detained
her
and
looked
around
as
if
to
trying
to
find
someone
then
on
catching
sight
of
abbé
faujas
she
inquired
with
a
smile
your
reverence
a
gallant
man
the
abbé
bowed
then
i
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
escort
my
daughter
home
you
both
live
in
the
same
house
and
so
it
will
not
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
on
the
road
there
is
a
little
bit
of
dark
lane
which
is
not
very
pleasant
for
a
lady
by
herself
marthe
assured
her
mother
in
her
quiet
way
that
she
was
not
a
little
girl
and
in
no
wise
felt
afraid
but
as
félicité
insisted
saying
that
she
should
feel
easier
if
her
daughter
had
someone
with
her
she
at
last
accepted
the
abbé
escort
as
the
latter
retired
with
her
félicité
who
accompanied
them
to
the
landing
whispered
in
the
priest
ear
with
a
smile
forget
what
i
told
you
you
must
make
yourself
agreeable
to
the
ladies
if
you
want
plassans
to
belong
to
you
vii
that
same
night
mouret
who
was
still
awake
when
his
wife
returned
home
plied
her
with
questions
in
his
desire
to
find
out
what
had
taken
place
at
madame
rougon
she
told
him
that
everything
had
gone
off
as
usual
and
that
she
had
noticed
nothing
out
of
the
common
she
just
added
that
abbé
faujas
had
walked
home
with
her
but
had
merely
spoken
of
commonplace
matters
mouret
was
very
much
vexed
at
what
he
called
his
wife
indolence
anyone
had
committed
suicide
at
your
mother
he
growled
as
he
angrily
buried
his
head
in
his
pillow
would
know
nothing
about
it
when
he
came
home
to
dinner
the
next
day
he
called
to
marthe
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
was
sure
of
it
i
knew
you
had
never
troubled
yourself
to
use
your
eyes
it
just
like
you
sitting
the
whole
evening
in
a
room
and
never
having
the
faintest
notion
of
what
was
being
said
or
done
around
you
why
the
whole
town
is
talking
about
it
the
whole
town
do
you
hear
i
could
go
anywhere
without
somebody
speaking
to
me
about
what
my
dear
asked
marthe
in
astonishment
the
fine
success
of
abbé
faujas
forsooth
he
was
turned
out
of
the
green
he
was
i
saw
nothing
of
the
kind
i
told
you
that
you
never
see
anything
do
you
know
what
the
abbé
did
at
besançon
he
either
murdered
a
priest
or
committed
forgery
they
are
not
quite
certain
which
it
was
however
they
seem
to
have
given
him
a
nice
reception
he
turned
quite
green
well
it
all
up
with
him
now
marthe
bent
her
head
and
allowed
her
husband
to
revel
in
the
discomfiture
mouret
was
delighted
still
stick
to
my
first
idea
he
said
mother
and
he
have
got
some
underhand
plot
together
i
hear
that
she
showed
him
the
greatest
civility
it
was
she
was
it
who
asked
him
to
accompany
you
home
why
did
you
tell
me
so
marthe
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
replying
are
the
most
provoking
woman
in
the
world
her
husband
cried
these
little
details
are
of
the
greatest
importance
madame
paloque
whom
i
have
just
met
told
me
that
she
and
several
other
ladies
had
lingered
behind
to
see
how
the
abbé
would
effect
his
departure
and
that
your
mother
availed
herself
of
you
to
cover
the
parson
retreat
just
try
to
remember
now
what
he
said
to
you
as
he
walked
home
with
you
he
sat
down
by
his
wife
side
with
his
keen
questioning
little
eyes
fixed
upon
her
said
she
quietly
only
talked
to
me
about
the
trifling
commonplace
matters
such
as
anyone
might
have
talked
of
he
spoke
about
the
cold
which
was
very
sharp
and
about
the
quietness
of
the
town
at
and
i
think
he
mentioned
the
pleasant
evening
he
had
passed
the
hypocrite
did
he
ask
you
any
questions
about
your
mother
or
her
guests
the
rue
de
la
banne
is
only
a
very
short
distance
you
know
and
it
did
take
us
three
minutes
he
walked
by
my
side
without
offering
me
his
arm
and
he
took
such
long
strides
that
i
was
almost
obliged
to
run
i
do
know
why
folks
should
all
be
so
bitter
against
him
he
does
seem
very
well
off
and
he
was
shivering
poor
man
in
that
threadbare
old
cassock
of
his
mouret
was
not
without
pity
and
sympathy
he
must
have
done
he
said
ca
feel
very
warm
now
that
the
frost
has
come
sure
we
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
his
conduct
marthe
continued
is
very
punctual
in
his
payments
and
he
makes
no
noise
and
gives
no
trouble
where
could
you
find
a
more
desirable
tenant
i
grant
you
what
i
was
saying
just
now
was
to
show
you
what
little
attention
you
pay
wherever
you
go
to
what
takes
place
around
you
i
know
the
set
your
mother
receives
too
well
to
attach
much
weight
to
anything
that
happens
in
the
green
it
a
perpetual
source
of
lies
and
the
most
ridiculous
stories
i
do
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
abbé
ever
murdered
anyone
any
more
than
that
he
was
ever
a
bankrupt
and
i
told
madame
paloque
that
people
ought
to
see
that
their
own
linen
was
clean
before
they
found
fault
with
that
of
others
i
hope
she
took
the
hint
to
herself
this
was
a
fib
on
mouret
part
for
he
had
said
nothing
of
the
kind
to
madame
paloque
but
marthe
pity
had
made
him
feel
rather
ashamed
of
the
delight
which
he
had
manifested
at
the
abbé
troubles
on
the
following
days
he
went
entirely
over
to
the
priest
side
and
whenever
he
happened
to
meet
any
people
whom
he
detested
monsieur
de
bourdeu
monsieur
delangre
and
doctor
porquier
he
launched
out
into
warm
praises
of
the
abbé
just
for
the
pleasure
of
astonishing
and
annoying
them
the
abbé
said
he
was
a
man
of
great
courage
and
perfect
guilelessness
but
extremely
poor
and
some
very
person
must
have
originated
the
calumnies
about
him
then
he
went
on
to
have
a
rap
at
the
rougons
guests
whom
he
called
hypocrites
canting
humbugs
and
idiots
who
were
afraid
of
a
man
of
real
virtue
in
a
short
time
he
had
quite
made
the
abbé
quarrel
his
own
and
availed
himself
of
it
to
attack
both
the
rastoil
gang
and
the
gang
of
the
as
well
it
pitiable
he
sometimes
said
to
his
wife
forgetting
that
she
had
heard
him
tell
a
very
different
story
it
pitiable
to
see
a
lot
of
people
who
stole
their
money
no
one
knows
where
leaguing
so
bitterly
against
a
poor
man
just
because
he
has
got
twenty
francs
to
spare
to
buy
a
of
firewood
such
conduct
quite
disgusts
me
i
quite
willing
to
be
surety
for
him
i
ought
to
know
what
he
does
and
what
sort
of
a
man
he
is
since
he
lives
in
my
house
and
so
not
slack
in
telling
them
the
truth
i
give
them
all
they
deserve
when
i
meet
them
and
i
wo
content
myself
with
that
either
i
want
the
abbé
to
be
my
friend
and
i
mean
to
walk
out
with
him
along
the
promenade
to
let
people
know
that
i
not
afraid
of
being
seen
with
him
rich
and
well
thought
of
as
i
am
i
hope
too
that
you
will
show
all
the
kindness
and
consideration
to
these
poor
people
that
you
can
marthe
smiled
quietly
she
was
delighted
at
the
friendly
disposition
her
husband
was
now
manifesting
towards
their
lodgers
rose
was
ordered
to
show
them
every
civility
she
was
even
told
that
she
might
volunteer
to
do
madame
faujas
shopping
for
her
on
wet
mornings
the
latter
however
always
declined
the
cook
services
though
she
no
longer
manifested
that
silent
stiffness
of
demeanour
which
she
had
shown
during
the
earlier
days
of
her
residence
in
the
house
one
morning
as
she
met
marthe
who
was
coming
down
from
an
attic
which
was
used
as
a
for
the
fruit
she
stopped
and
talked
to
her
for
a
moment
and
even
unbent
so
far
as
to
accept
a
couple
of
magnificent
pears
those
pears
were
the
beginning
of
a
closer
intimacy
between
them
abbé
faujas
too
did
not
now
glide
so
hurriedly
up
and
down
the
stairs
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
almost
every
day
when
mouret
heard
the
rustling
of
the
priest
cassock
as
he
came
down
he
hastened
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
told
the
abbé
that
it
would
give
him
great
pleasure
to
walk
part
of
the
way
with
him
he
had
also
thanked
him
for
the
little
service
he
had
done
his
wife
skilfully
questioning
him
at
the
time
to
find
out
if
he
intended
again
calling
on
the
rougons
the
abbé
had
smiled
and
freely
confessed
that
he
was
not
fitted
for
society
this
had
delighted
mouret
who
felt
quite
certain
that
he
had
had
some
influence
in
bringing
about
his
lodger
decision
he
even
began
to
dream
of
preventing
all
future
intercourse
with
the
green
and
of
keeping
him
altogether
to
himself
so
when
marthe
told
him
one
evening
that
madame
faujas
had
accepted
a
couple
of
pears
he
looked
upon
this
as
a
fortunate
circumstance
which
would
facilitate
the
execution
of
his
designs
they
really
got
a
fire
on
the
second
floor
this
bitterly
cold
weather
he
asked
in
rose
presence
indeed
sir
replied
the
cook
who
understood
that
the
question
was
meant
for
herself
could
very
well
have
one
for
never
seen
the
least
bit
of
wood
taken
upstairs
unless
indeed
burning
their
four
chairs
or
madame
faujas
manages
to
carry
up
the
wood
in
her
basket
is
not
right
of
you
to
talk
in
that
way
rose
said
marthe
poor
things
must
be
shivering
with
cold
in
those
big
rooms
should
think
so
indeed
exclaimed
mouret
were
several
degrees
of
frost
last
night
and
there
was
considerable
fear
felt
about
the
the
water
in
our
jug
upstairs
was
frozen
this
room
of
ours
here
is
a
small
one
however
and
very
warm
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
were
provided
with
pads
so
that
no
draught
could
find
its
way
through
any
crevice
and
a
big
earthenware
stove
made
the
place
as
warm
as
a
bakehouse
during
the
winter
evenings
the
young
people
read
or
played
round
the
table
while
mouret
made
his
wife
play
piquet
till
which
by
the
way
was
perfect
torture
to
her
for
a
long
time
she
had
refused
to
touch
the
cards
saying
that
she
did
not
know
a
single
game
but
at
last
he
had
taught
her
piquet
and
she
had
then
been
forced
to
resign
herself
to
her
fate
you
think
mouret
continued
we
really
ought
to
ask
the
faujases
to
come
and
spend
the
evenings
here
they
would
at
any
rate
be
warm
for
two
or
three
hours
and
they
would
be
company
for
us
too
and
make
us
feel
more
lively
ask
them
and
i
do
think
they
refuse
the
next
day
marthe
met
madame
faujas
in
the
hall
and
gave
the
invitation
which
the
old
lady
at
once
accepted
both
for
herself
and
her
son
surprised
she
did
make
some
little
demur
about
coming
said
mouret
fancied
that
they
would
have
required
more
pressing
but
the
abbé
is
beginning
to
understand
that
he
does
wrong
in
living
like
a
wild
beast
in
the
evening
mouret
took
care
that
the
table
was
cleared
in
good
time
and
he
set
out
a
bottle
of
sweet
wine
and
a
plateful
of
little
cakes
although
he
was
not
given
to
being
lavish
he
was
anxious
to
show
that
the
rougons
were
not
the
only
people
who
knew
how
things
ought
to
be
done
the
tenants
of
the
second
floor
came
downstairs
about
eight
abbé
faujas
was
wearing
a
new
cassock
at
the
sight
of
which
mouret
was
so
much
surprised
that
he
could
only
stammer
a
few
words
in
answer
to
the
priest
courtesies
monsieur
all
the
honour
is
for
us
come
children
put
some
chairs
here
they
all
took
their
seats
round
the
table
the
room
was
uncomfortably
warm
for
mouret
had
crammed
the
stove
as
full
as
possible
in
order
to
let
his
guests
see
that
he
made
no
account
of
a
log
more
or
less
abbé
faujas
made
himself
very
pleasant
fondling
désirée
and
questioning
the
two
lads
about
their
studies
marthe
who
was
knitting
some
stockings
raised
her
eyes
every
now
and
then
in
surprise
at
the
flexible
tones
of
that
strange
voice
which
she
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
sounding
in
the
monotonous
quietness
of
the
she
looked
at
the
powerful
face
and
features
and
then
bent
her
head
again
without
trying
to
hide
the
interest
she
took
in
this
man
who
was
so
strong
and
kindly
and
whom
she
knew
to
be
so
poor
as
for
mouret
he
uncouthly
stared
at
the
new
cassock
and
could
not
restrain
himself
from
saying
with
a
sly
smile
need
have
troubled
to
dress
to
come
here
monsieur
we
do
go
in
for
ceremony
as
you
know
very
well
marthe
blushed
while
the
priest
gaily
related
that
he
had
bought
the
cassock
that
very
day
he
had
kept
it
on
he
said
to
please
his
mother
who
thought
that
he
looked
finer
than
a
king
in
it
you
mother
he
asked
the
old
lady
madame
faujas
nodded
without
taking
her
eyes
off
her
son
she
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
gazing
at
him
in
the
bright
lamplight
with
an
air
of
ecstasy
they
began
to
talk
of
various
matters
and
abbé
faujas
seemed
to
throw
off
his
gloomy
coldness
he
still
remained
grave
but
it
was
with
a
pleasant
gravity
he
listened
attentively
to
mouret
replied
to
his
most
insignificant
remarks
and
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
his
gossip
his
landlord
explained
to
him
the
manner
in
which
the
family
lived
and
finished
his
account
by
saying
spend
our
evenings
in
the
way
you
see
always
as
quietly
as
this
we
never
invite
anyone
as
we
are
always
more
comfortable
by
ourselves
every
evening
i
have
a
game
at
piquet
with
my
wife
it
is
a
very
old
habit
of
ours
and
i
could
scarcely
go
to
sleep
without
it
do
let
us
interfere
with
it
cried
abbé
faujas
beg
that
you
wo
in
any
way
depart
from
your
usual
habits
on
our
account
dear
no
i
am
not
a
monomaniac
about
it
and
it
wo
kill
me
to
go
without
it
for
once
the
priest
insisted
for
a
time
but
when
he
saw
that
marthe
declined
to
play
with
even
greater
determination
than
her
husband
he
turned
towards
his
mother
who
had
been
sitting
silent
with
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
and
said
you
have
a
game
with
monsieur
mouret
she
looked
keenly
into
her
son
eyes
while
mouret
still
continued
to
refuse
and
declared
that
he
did
not
want
to
break
up
the
party
however
when
the
priest
told
him
that
his
mother
was
a
good
player
he
gave
way
she
indeed
he
said
if
madame
really
wishes
it
and
no
one
objects
along
mother
and
have
a
game
said
abbé
faujas
in
a
more
decided
tone
she
replied
shall
be
delighted
but
i
shall
have
to
change
my
place
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
that
said
mouret
who
was
quite
charmed
had
better
take
your
son
seat
and
perhaps
monsieur
will
be
good
enough
to
sit
next
to
my
wife
madame
can
sit
next
to
me
there
that
will
do
capitally
the
priest
who
had
at
first
been
opposite
to
marthe
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
thus
placed
next
to
her
they
sat
quite
apart
by
themselves
the
two
players
having
drawn
their
chairs
close
together
to
engage
in
their
struggle
octave
and
serge
had
just
gone
up
to
their
room
désirée
was
sleeping
with
her
head
on
the
table
after
her
usual
custom
when
ten
struck
mouret
who
had
lost
the
first
game
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
to
bed
but
asked
for
his
revenge
madame
faujas
consulted
her
son
with
a
glance
and
then
in
her
tranquil
fashion
began
to
shuffle
the
cards
the
abbé
had
merely
exchanged
a
few
words
with
marthe
on
this
the
first
evening
that
he
spent
in
the
he
only
spoke
of
commonplace
topics
the
household
the
price
of
victuals
at
plassans
and
the
anxieties
which
children
caused
marthe
replied
with
a
show
of
interest
looking
up
every
now
and
then
with
her
bright
glance
and
importing
into
the
conversation
some
of
her
own
sedate
good
sense
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
mouret
threw
down
the
cards
with
some
slight
irritation
have
lost
again
he
said
have
had
a
single
good
card
all
the
evening
perhaps
i
shall
have
better
luck
we
shall
see
you
again
i
hope
madame
and
when
abbé
faujas
began
to
protest
that
they
could
not
think
of
abusing
the
mourets
kindness
by
disturbing
them
in
this
way
every
evening
he
continued
you
are
not
disturbing
us
at
all
you
are
giving
us
pleasure
besides
i
have
been
defeated
and
i
sure
that
madame
ca
refuse
me
another
game
when
the
priest
and
his
mother
had
accepted
the
invitation
and
had
gone
upstairs
again
mouret
showed
some
and
began
to
excuse
himself
for
having
lost
he
seemed
quite
annoyed
about
it
old
woman
is
as
good
a
player
as
i
am
i
sure
he
said
to
his
wife
she
has
got
such
eyes
i
could
really
almost
fancy
she
was
cheating
upon
my
word
i
could
well
we
shall
see
what
happens
from
that
time
the
faujases
came
down
regularly
every
day
to
spend
the
evening
with
the
mourets
there
were
tremendous
battles
between
the
old
lady
and
her
landlord
she
seemed
to
play
with
him
to
let
him
win
just
frequently
enough
to
prevent
him
from
being
altogether
discouraged
and
this
made
him
fume
with
suppressed
anger
for
he
prided
himself
on
his
skill
at
piquet
he
used
to
indulge
in
dreams
of
beating
her
night
after
night
for
weeks
in
succession
without
ever
letting
her
win
a
single
game
while
she
ever
preserved
wonderful
coolness
her
square
face
remaining
quite
expressionless
as
with
her
big
hands
she
threw
down
the
cards
with
all
the
regularity
of
a
machine
from
eight
till
they
would
remain
seated
at
their
end
of
the
table
quite
absorbed
in
their
game
and
never
moving
at
the
other
end
near
the
stove
abbé
faujas
and
marthe
were
left
entirely
to
themselves
the
abbé
felt
a
masculine
and
priestly
disdain
for
woman
and
in
spite
of
himself
this
disdain
often
made
itself
manifest
in
some
slightly
harsh
expression
on
these
occasions
marthe
was
affected
by
a
strange
feeling
of
anxiety
she
raised
her
eyes
with
one
of
those
sudden
thrills
of
alarm
which
cause
people
to
cast
a
hurried
glance
behind
them
half
expecting
to
see
some
concealed
enemy
raising
his
hand
to
strike
at
other
times
on
catching
sight
of
the
abbé
cassock
she
would
check
herself
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
laugh
and
would
relapse
into
silence
quite
confused
astonished
at
finding
herself
talking
so
freely
to
a
man
who
was
so
different
from
other
men
it
was
a
long
time
before
there
was
any
real
intimacy
between
them
abbé
faujas
never
directly
questioned
marthe
about
her
husband
or
her
children
or
her
house
but
nevertheless
he
gradually
made
himself
acquainted
with
every
detail
of
their
history
and
manner
of
life
every
evening
while
mouret
and
madame
faujas
were
contending
furiously
one
against
the
other
he
contrived
to
learn
some
new
fact
upon
one
occasion
he
remarked
that
the
husband
and
wife
were
surprisingly
alike
marthe
answered
with
a
smile
we
were
twenty
years
old
we
used
to
be
taken
for
brother
and
sister
and
indeed
it
was
a
little
owing
to
that
circumstance
that
we
got
married
people
used
to
joke
us
about
it
and
were
continually
making
us
stand
side
by
side
and
saying
what
a
fine
couple
we
should
make
the
likeness
was
so
striking
that
worthy
monsieur
compan
though
he
knew
us
quite
well
hesitated
to
marry
us
you
are
cousins
are
you
not
the
priest
asked
she
replied
with
a
slight
blush
husband
is
a
macquart
and
i
am
a
rougon
then
she
kept
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
feeling
ill
at
ease
for
she
was
sure
that
the
priest
knew
the
history
of
her
family
which
was
so
notorious
at
plassans
the
macquarts
were
an
illegitimate
branch
of
the
rougons
most
singular
part
of
it
she
resumed
to
conceal
her
embarrassment
that
we
both
resemble
our
grandmother
my
mother
transmitted
the
likeness
to
him
while
in
me
it
has
sprung
up
again
after
a
break
passing
my
father
by
then
the
abbé
cited
a
similar
instance
in
his
own
family
he
had
a
sister
he
said
who
was
the
living
image
of
her
mother
grandfather
the
likeness
in
this
case
had
leapt
over
two
generations
his
sister
too
closely
resembled
the
old
man
in
her
character
and
habits
even
in
her
gestures
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
just
the
same
with
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
often
heard
people
say
of
me
remarked
marthe
she
aunt
dide
all
over
again
the
poor
woman
is
now
at
les
tulettes
she
never
had
a
strong
head
for
my
part
in
growing
older
i
have
become
less
excitable
and
stronger
but
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
child
i
had
good
health
at
all
i
used
to
have
attacks
of
giddiness
and
my
head
was
filled
with
the
strangest
fancies
i
often
laugh
now
when
i
think
of
the
extraordinary
things
i
used
to
do
your
husband
he
takes
after
his
father
a
journeyman
hatter
a
careful
prudent
man
i
should
say
that
when
we
were
young
though
we
were
so
much
alike
in
face
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
as
to
our
dispositions
however
as
time
has
gone
on
we
have
grown
to
resemble
each
other
very
much
we
were
so
quiet
and
happy
in
our
business
at
marseilles
the
fifteen
years
i
spent
there
taught
me
to
find
happiness
in
my
own
home
in
the
midst
of
my
children
abbé
faujas
noticed
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
her
tone
every
time
that
he
led
her
to
speak
on
this
subject
she
was
certainly
happy
as
she
said
but
he
fancied
that
he
could
detect
traces
of
old
rebellion
in
her
nervous
nature
that
was
now
calmed
by
the
approach
of
her
fortieth
year
he
imagined
a
little
drama
for
himself
in
which
this
husband
and
wife
who
were
so
much
alike
were
considered
by
their
relations
to
be
made
for
each
other
and
were
thus
forced
into
marriage
whereas
in
reality
they
were
of
different
and
antagonistic
temperaments
then
his
mind
dwelt
upon
the
fatal
outcome
of
a
monotonous
life
the
wearing
away
of
character
by
the
daily
cares
of
business
the
soporific
effect
of
fifteen
years
upon
this
couple
who
were
now
living
upon
that
fortune
in
a
sleepy
corner
of
a
little
town
though
they
were
both
still
young
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
the
ashes
left
of
their
former
selves
the
abbé
cleverly
tried
to
discover
whether
marthe
was
resigned
to
her
existence
and
he
found
her
full
of
common
sense
am
quite
contented
with
my
home
she
said
children
are
all
that
i
want
i
was
never
much
given
to
gaiety
i
only
felt
a
little
dull
at
times
i
dare
say
i
should
have
been
better
if
i
had
had
some
mental
occupation
but
i
was
never
able
to
find
one
and
perhaps
after
all
it
as
well
i
did
for
i
should
very
likely
have
split
my
head
i
could
never
even
read
a
novel
without
giving
myself
a
frightful
headache
and
for
nights
afterwards
all
the
characters
would
dance
about
in
my
brain
needlework
is
the
only
thing
which
never
fatigues
me
so
i
stay
at
home
and
keep
out
of
the
way
of
noise
and
chatter
and
all
the
frivolous
follies
which
weary
me
she
paused
every
now
and
then
to
glance
at
désirée
who
was
still
sleeping
with
her
head
upon
the
table
and
smiling
in
her
innocent
way
child
she
murmured
ca
even
do
any
needlework
she
gets
dizzy
directly
she
is
fond
of
animals
and
that
all
she
capable
of
when
she
goes
to
stay
with
her
nurse
as
she
does
every
now
and
then
she
spends
all
her
time
in
the
and
she
comes
back
to
me
with
rosy
cheeks
and
as
strong
and
well
as
possible
marthe
often
spoke
of
les
tulettes
manifesting
as
she
did
so
a
lurking
fear
of
insanity
and
abbé
faujas
thus
became
aware
of
a
strange
dread
haunting
this
peaceful
home
marthe
loved
her
husband
with
a
sober
unimpassioned
love
but
there
was
mingled
with
her
affection
for
him
considerable
fear
of
his
jokes
and
pleasantries
his
perpetual
teasing
she
was
hurt
too
by
his
selfishness
and
the
loneliness
in
which
he
left
her
she
felt
a
vague
grudge
against
him
for
the
quietude
in
which
she
lived
that
very
manner
of
life
which
she
said
made
her
happy
when
she
spoke
of
him
she
said
is
very
good
to
us
you
heard
him
i
dare
say
get
angry
sometimes
but
that
arises
from
his
passion
for
seeing
everything
in
order
which
he
often
carries
to
an
almost
ridiculous
extent
he
gets
quite
vexed
if
he
sees
a
a
little
out
of
place
in
the
garden
or
a
plaything
lying
about
on
the
floor
but
in
other
matters
he
does
quite
right
in
pleasing
himself
i
know
he
is
not
very
popular
because
he
has
managed
to
accumulate
some
money
and
still
continues
to
do
a
good
stroke
of
business
every
now
and
then
but
he
only
laughs
at
what
people
say
about
him
they
say
nasty
things
too
of
him
in
connexion
with
me
they
say
that
he
is
a
miser
and
wo
let
me
go
out
anywhere
and
even
deprives
me
of
boots
but
all
that
is
quite
untrue
i
am
entirely
free
he
certainly
prefers
to
see
me
here
when
he
comes
home
instead
of
finding
that
i
am
always
off
somewhere
paying
calls
and
walking
on
the
promenade
but
he
knows
quite
well
what
my
tastes
are
what
indeed
should
i
go
out
for
as
she
defended
mouret
against
the
gossip
of
plassans
marthe
voice
assumed
a
sudden
animation
as
though
she
felt
the
need
of
defending
him
quite
as
much
from
the
secret
accusations
which
arose
within
her
own
mind
and
she
kept
reverting
with
nervous
uneasiness
to
the
subject
of
society
life
she
seemed
to
seek
a
refuge
within
the
little
and
the
garden
with
its
box
borders
as
if
everything
else
filled
her
with
vague
alarm
and
made
her
doubtful
of
her
strength
apprehensive
of
some
possible
catastrophe
then
she
would
smile
at
her
fears
and
shrug
her
shoulders
as
she
resumed
her
knitting
or
the
mending
of
some
old
skirt
and
abbé
faujas
would
see
before
him
only
a
cold
reserved
housewife
with
listless
face
and
inanimate
eyes
who
filled
the
house
with
a
scent
as
of
clean
linen
and
of
blossoms
gathered
in
the
shade
two
months
passed
away
in
this
manner
abbé
faujas
and
his
mother
had
become
quite
a
part
of
the
mourets
family
life
they
all
had
their
recognised
places
every
evening
at
the
table
just
as
the
lamp
had
its
place
and
the
same
intervals
of
silence
were
broken
night
after
night
by
the
same
remarks
from
the
and
the
same
subdued
converse
of
the
priest
and
marthe
when
madame
faujas
had
not
given
him
too
tremendous
a
beating
mouret
found
his
lodgers
nice
people
all
that
curiosity
of
his
born
of
idleness
waned
before
the
interest
and
occupation
that
the
nightly
parties
afforded
him
and
he
no
longer
played
the
spy
upon
the
abbé
whom
he
declared
to
be
a
very
good
fellow
now
that
he
knew
him
better
do
bother
me
with
your
stories
he
used
to
exclaim
to
those
who
attacked
abbé
faujas
get
hold
of
a
pack
of
nonsense
and
put
absurd
interpretations
upon
facts
that
admit
of
the
simplest
explanation
i
know
all
about
him
he
very
kindly
comes
and
spends
his
evenings
with
us
but
he
not
a
man
to
make
himself
cheap
and
i
can
quite
understand
that
people
do
like
him
for
it
and
accuse
him
of
pride
mouret
greatly
enjoyed
being
the
only
person
in
plassans
who
could
boast
of
knowing
abbé
faujas
and
he
even
somewhat
abused
this
advantage
every
time
he
met
madame
rougon
he
put
on
an
air
of
triumph
and
made
her
understand
that
he
had
stolen
her
guest
from
her
while
the
old
lady
contented
herself
with
smiling
quietly
with
his
intimate
acquaintances
mouret
extended
his
confidences
further
and
remarked
that
those
blessed
priests
could
do
nothing
like
other
people
then
he
gave
them
a
string
of
little
details
and
told
them
in
what
manner
the
abbé
drank
how
he
talked
to
women
and
how
he
always
kept
his
knees
apart
without
ever
crossing
his
legs
and
other
trifling
matters
which
the
vague
alarm
that
his
mind
experienced
in
the
presence
of
his
guest
long
cassock
made
him
notice
the
evenings
passed
away
one
after
another
and
at
last
the
first
days
of
february
came
round
in
all
the
conversations
between
himself
and
marthe
abbé
faujas
had
to
all
appearance
carefully
avoided
the
subject
of
religion
she
had
once
remarked
to
him
almost
lightly
monsieur
i
am
not
a
very
religious
woman
and
i
seldom
go
to
church
at
marseilles
i
was
always
too
busy
and
now
i
am
too
indolent
to
go
out
and
then
i
must
confess
to
you
that
i
brought
up
with
religious
ideas
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
that
god
would
come
to
us
quite
as
well
at
home
the
priest
bowed
his
head
without
making
any
reply
and
seemed
to
signify
that
he
would
rather
not
discuss
religious
matters
under
such
circumstances
one
evening
however
he
drew
a
picture
of
the
unexpected
comfort
which
suffering
souls
find
in
religion
they
were
talking
of
a
poor
woman
whom
troubles
of
every
sort
had
driven
to
suicide
did
wrong
to
despair
said
the
priest
in
his
deep
voice
was
ignorant
of
the
comfort
and
consolation
to
be
found
in
prayer
i
have
often
seen
weeping
women
come
to
us
and
they
have
gone
away
again
filled
with
a
resignation
that
they
had
vainly
sought
elsewhere
and
glad
to
live
and
this
had
come
from
their
falling
upon
their
knees
and
tasting
the
blessedness
of
humiliating
themselves
before
god
in
some
quiet
corner
of
the
church
they
came
back
there
they
forgot
their
troubles
and
became
god
entirely
marthe
listened
with
a
thoughtful
expression
to
these
remarks
of
the
priest
whose
last
words
fell
in
a
gradually
softening
voice
that
seemed
to
breathe
of
superhuman
felicity
it
must
be
a
blessed
thing
she
murmured
as
though
she
were
speaking
to
herself
have
thought
about
it
sometimes
but
i
have
always
felt
afraid
if
the
abbé
seldom
referred
to
such
matters
as
this
he
frequently
spoke
on
the
subject
of
charity
marthe
was
very
and
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
at
the
slightest
tale
of
trouble
it
seemed
to
please
the
priest
to
see
her
so
moved
to
pity
and
every
evening
he
told
her
some
fresh
story
of
sorrow
and
kept
her
constantly
excited
with
compassion
she
would
let
her
work
fall
and
clasp
her
hands
as
with
a
sad
pitying
face
she
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
listened
to
him
as
he
recounted
details
of
how
some
poor
persons
had
died
of
starvation
or
how
others
had
been
goaded
by
misery
into
committing
base
crimes
at
these
times
she
fell
completely
under
his
influence
and
he
might
have
done
what
he
willed
with
her
about
the
middle
of
february
a
deplorable
occurrence
threw
plassans
into
dismay
it
was
discovered
that
a
number
of
young
girls
scarcely
more
than
children
had
fallen
into
evil
courses
while
loafing
about
the
streets
and
it
was
even
rumoured
that
some
persons
of
high
position
in
the
town
would
be
compromised
for
a
week
marthe
was
very
painfully
affected
by
this
discovery
which
caused
the
greatest
sensation
she
was
acquainted
with
one
of
the
unfortunate
girls
who
was
the
niece
of
her
cook
rose
and
she
could
not
think
of
the
poor
little
creature
without
shuddering
is
a
great
pity
said
abbé
faujas
to
her
one
evening
there
is
a
home
at
plassans
on
the
model
of
the
one
at
besançon
then
in
reply
to
marthe
pressing
questions
the
abbé
explained
to
her
the
constitution
of
this
home
it
was
a
sort
of
refuge
for
girls
from
eight
to
fifteen
years
of
age
the
daughters
of
working
men
whose
parents
were
obliged
to
leave
them
alone
during
the
day
while
they
themselves
went
to
their
employment
during
the
these
girls
were
set
to
do
needlework
and
in
the
evening
they
were
sent
back
to
their
parents
the
latter
having
then
returned
home
from
their
work
by
this
system
the
children
were
brought
up
out
of
the
reach
of
vice
and
in
the
midst
of
good
examples
marthe
thought
the
idea
an
admirable
one
and
she
gradually
became
so
prepossessed
in
its
favour
that
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
than
the
necessity
of
founding
a
similar
institution
at
plassans
might
put
it
under
the
patronage
of
the
virgin
abbé
faujas
suggested
there
are
such
difficulties
in
the
way
you
have
no
idea
of
the
trouble
there
is
in
effecting
the
least
good
work
what
is
quite
essential
to
the
success
of
such
a
scheme
as
this
is
some
woman
with
a
motherly
heart
full
of
zeal
and
absolutely
devoted
to
the
work
marthe
lowered
her
head
and
looked
at
désirée
who
was
asleep
by
her
side
and
she
felt
tears
welling
from
beneath
her
eyelids
she
made
inquiries
as
to
the
steps
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
for
founding
such
a
home
the
cost
of
erecting
it
and
the
annual
expenses
you
help
me
she
suddenly
asked
the
priest
one
evening
abbé
faujas
gravely
took
her
hand
and
held
it
within
his
own
for
a
moment
telling
her
that
she
had
one
of
the
fairest
souls
he
had
ever
known
he
would
willingly
do
what
he
could
he
assured
her
but
he
should
rely
altogether
upon
her
for
the
assistance
that
he
himself
would
be
able
to
give
would
be
small
it
would
be
for
her
to
form
a
committee
of
the
ladies
of
the
town
to
collect
subscriptions
and
to
take
upon
herself
in
a
word
all
the
delicate
and
onerous
duties
which
are
connected
with
an
appeal
to
the
charity
of
the
public
he
appointed
a
meeting
with
her
for
the
following
day
at
to
introduce
her
to
the
diocesan
architect
who
would
be
able
to
tell
her
much
better
than
he
himself
could
do
about
the
expenses
that
would
have
to
be
incurred
mouret
was
very
gay
that
evening
when
they
went
to
bed
he
had
not
allowed
madame
faujas
to
win
a
single
game
seem
quite
pleased
about
something
my
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
you
see
what
a
beating
i
gave
the
old
lady
downstairs
then
as
he
observed
marthe
taking
a
silk
dress
out
of
her
wardrobe
he
asked
her
with
some
surprise
if
she
intended
to
go
out
in
the
morning
he
had
not
heard
anything
of
the
conversation
in
the
between
his
wife
and
the
priest
she
replied
have
to
go
out
i
have
to
meet
abbé
faujas
at
the
church
about
a
matter
which
i
will
tell
you
of
he
stood
motionless
in
front
of
her
and
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
of
stupefaction
wondering
if
she
were
not
really
jesting
with
him
then
without
any
appearance
of
displeasure
he
said
in
his
bantering
fashion
hallo
well
i
never
expected
that
so
you
gone
over
to
the
priests
now
viii
the
next
morning
marthe
began
by
calling
on
her
mother
to
whom
she
explained
the
pious
undertaking
which
she
was
contemplating
she
became
almost
angry
when
the
old
lady
smilingly
shook
her
head
and
she
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
considered
her
lacking
in
charity
is
one
of
abbé
faujas
ideas
is
it
félicité
suddenly
inquired
marthe
replied
in
surprise
have
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
together
but
how
did
you
know
madame
rougon
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
vouchsafing
any
definite
reply
then
she
continued
with
a
show
of
animation
my
dear
i
think
you
are
quite
right
you
ought
to
have
some
kind
of
occupation
and
you
have
found
a
very
good
one
it
has
always
distressed
me
very
much
to
see
you
perpetually
shut
up
in
that
lonely
house
of
yours
but
you
must
count
upon
my
assistance
i
would
rather
not
appear
in
the
matter
for
people
would
say
that
it
was
i
who
was
really
doing
everything
and
that
we
had
come
to
an
understanding
together
to
try
to
force
our
ideas
upon
the
town
i
should
prefer
that
you
yourself
should
have
all
the
credit
of
your
charitable
inspiration
i
will
help
you
with
my
advice
if
you
will
let
me
but
with
nothing
more
was
hoping
that
you
would
join
the
committee
said
marthe
who
felt
a
little
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
finding
herself
alone
in
such
an
onerous
undertaking
no
my
presence
on
it
would
only
do
harm
i
can
assure
you
make
it
well
known
on
the
contrary
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
on
the
committee
that
i
have
been
asked
and
have
refused
excusing
myself
on
the
ground
that
i
am
too
much
occupied
let
it
be
understood
even
that
i
have
no
faith
in
your
scheme
and
that
you
will
see
will
influence
the
ladies
at
once
they
will
be
delighted
to
take
part
in
charitable
work
in
which
i
have
no
share
go
and
see
madame
rastoil
madame
de
condamin
madame
delangre
and
madame
paloque
be
sure
to
see
madame
paloque
she
will
feel
flattered
and
will
help
you
more
than
all
the
others
if
you
find
any
difficulty
about
anything
come
here
again
and
tell
me
she
accompanied
her
daughter
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
she
stopped
and
looked
her
in
the
face
saying
with
her
sharp
smile
hope
the
dear
abbé
keeps
well
he
is
quite
well
replied
marthe
am
going
to
where
i
am
to
meet
the
diocesan
architect
marthe
and
the
priest
had
considered
that
matters
were
still
in
too
indefinite
a
stage
for
them
to
disturb
the
architect
and
so
they
had
planned
just
to
meet
him
at
where
he
came
every
day
to
inspect
a
chapel
that
happened
to
be
under
repair
at
the
time
it
would
seem
like
a
chance
meeting
when
marthe
walked
up
the
church
she
caught
sight
of
abbé
faujas
and
monsieur
lieutaud
the
architect
talking
together
on
some
scaffolding
from
which
they
descended
as
soon
as
they
saw
her
one
of
the
abbé
shoulders
was
quite
white
with
plaster
and
he
seemed
to
be
taking
a
great
interest
in
the
operations
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
there
were
no
worshippers
or
penitents
in
the
church
and
the
nave
and
aisles
were
quite
deserted
encumbered
only
by
a
litter
of
chairs
which
two
vergers
were
noisily
setting
in
order
workmen
were
calling
to
each
other
from
the
tops
of
ladders
and
trowels
were
scraping
against
the
walls
there
was
so
little
appearance
of
devotion
about
that
marthe
had
not
even
crossed
herself
on
entering
she
took
a
seat
opposite
to
the
chapel
that
was
being
repaired
between
abbé
faujas
and
monsieur
lieutaud
just
as
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
gone
to
consult
the
latter
in
his
office
the
conversation
lasted
for
a
good
the
architect
showed
much
kindly
interest
in
the
scheme
but
he
advised
them
not
to
erect
a
special
building
for
the
home
of
the
virgin
as
the
abbé
called
the
projected
refuge
it
would
cost
too
much
money
he
thought
and
it
would
be
better
to
buy
some
building
already
in
existence
and
adapt
it
to
suit
the
requirements
of
their
scheme
he
suggested
a
house
in
the
faubourg
which
after
being
used
as
a
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
forage
dealer
and
was
now
for
sale
a
few
thousand
francs
would
enable
one
to
entirely
transform
the
place
and
restore
it
from
its
present
ruinous
condition
and
he
promised
them
all
kinds
of
wonderful
things
a
handsome
entrance
spacious
rooms
and
a
court
planted
with
trees
by
degrees
marthe
and
the
priest
raised
their
voices
and
they
discussed
details
beneath
the
echoing
vaults
of
the
nave
while
monsieur
lieutaud
scratched
the
with
the
tip
of
his
stick
to
give
them
an
idea
of
the
façade
he
suggested
is
settled
then
said
marthe
as
she
took
leave
of
the
architect
will
make
a
little
estimate
wo
you
so
that
we
may
know
what
we
are
about
and
please
keep
our
secret
will
you
abbé
faujas
wished
to
escort
her
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
church
as
they
passed
together
before
the
however
while
she
was
still
briskly
talking
to
him
she
was
suddenly
surprised
to
miss
him
from
her
side
she
turned
round
and
saw
him
bent
almost
double
before
the
great
cross
veiled
with
muslin
the
sight
of
him
covered
as
he
was
with
plaster
bent
in
this
way
before
the
cross
gave
her
a
singular
feeling
she
recollected
where
she
was
glanced
round
her
with
an
uneasy
expression
and
trod
as
silently
as
she
could
when
they
reached
the
door
the
abbé
who
had
become
very
grave
and
serious
silently
reached
out
his
finger
which
he
had
dipped
in
the
holy
water
and
she
crossed
herself
in
great
disquietude
of
mind
then
the
muffled
doors
softly
fell
back
behind
her
with
a
sound
like
a
sigh
from
the
church
marthe
repaired
to
madame
de
condamin
she
felt
quite
happy
as
she
walked
through
the
streets
in
the
fresh
air
the
few
visits
that
she
had
now
to
make
seemed
to
her
almost
like
madame
de
condamin
welcomed
her
with
an
air
of
friendly
surprise
that
dear
madame
mouret
came
so
seldom
when
she
learned
the
business
on
hand
she
declared
herself
charmed
with
it
and
was
quite
ready
to
further
it
in
every
possible
way
she
was
wearing
a
lovely
mauve
dress
with
knots
of
ribbon
in
that
pretty
boudoir
of
hers
where
she
played
the
part
of
an
exiled
parisienne
did
quite
right
to
count
upon
me
she
exclaimed
as
she
pressed
marthe
hands
ought
to
help
those
poor
girls
if
it
is
we
whom
people
accuse
of
setting
them
a
bad
example
by
our
luxury
it
is
frightful
to
think
of
those
children
being
exposed
to
all
those
horrible
dangers
it
has
made
me
feel
quite
ill
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
when
marthe
told
her
that
her
mother
could
not
join
the
committee
she
displayed
still
greater
enthusiasm
for
the
scheme
is
a
pity
madame
rougon
has
so
many
things
to
do
she
said
with
a
touch
of
irony
would
have
been
of
great
assistance
to
us
but
it
ca
be
helped
no
one
can
do
more
than
they
are
able
i
have
plenty
of
friends
i
will
go
and
see
the
bishop
and
move
heaven
and
earth
if
it
necessary
i
promise
you
that
we
shall
succeed
she
would
not
listen
to
any
of
the
particulars
about
the
expenses
she
was
quite
sure
she
said
that
whatever
money
was
wanted
would
be
found
and
she
meant
the
home
to
be
a
credit
to
the
committee
as
handsome
and
as
comfortable
as
possible
she
added
with
a
laugh
that
she
quite
lost
her
head
when
she
began
to
dabble
in
figures
but
she
undertook
to
charge
herself
with
the
preliminary
steps
and
the
general
furtherance
of
the
scheme
dear
madame
mouret
said
she
was
not
accustomed
to
begging
and
she
would
accompany
her
on
her
visits
and
would
even
take
several
of
them
off
her
hands
altogether
by
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
made
the
business
entirely
her
own
and
it
was
now
she
who
gave
instructions
to
marthe
the
latter
was
just
about
to
take
her
leave
when
monsieur
de
condamin
came
into
the
room
so
she
lingered
on
feeling
very
ill
at
ease
however
and
not
daring
to
say
any
more
on
the
subject
of
her
visit
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
was
rumoured
to
be
compromised
in
that
matter
of
the
poor
girls
with
whose
shameful
story
the
town
was
ringing
but
madame
de
condamin
explained
the
great
scheme
to
her
husband
who
listened
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
ease
and
gave
utterance
to
the
most
moral
sentiments
he
considered
the
scheme
an
extremely
proper
one
is
an
idea
which
could
only
have
occurred
to
a
mother
he
said
gravely
in
a
tone
which
made
it
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
was
serious
or
not
will
be
indebted
to
you
madame
for
a
purer
morality
i
must
tell
you
that
the
idea
is
not
my
own
i
have
merely
adopted
it
replied
marthe
made
uneasy
by
these
praises
was
suggested
to
me
by
a
person
whom
i
esteem
very
highly
was
that
asked
madame
de
condamin
with
a
show
of
curiosity
faujas
then
marthe
with
great
frankness
told
them
what
a
high
opinion
she
had
of
the
priest
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
unpleasant
stories
that
had
been
circulated
about
him
but
she
represented
him
as
a
man
worthy
of
the
highest
respect
whom
she
was
very
happy
to
receive
in
her
home
madame
de
condamin
nodded
approvingly
as
she
listened
always
said
so
she
exclaimed
faujas
is
a
very
distinguished
priest
but
there
are
such
a
lot
of
malicious
people
about
now
however
that
you
receive
him
in
your
home
they
do
venture
to
say
anything
more
against
him
all
that
calumnious
talk
has
been
cut
short
the
idea
you
say
is
his
we
shall
have
to
persuade
him
then
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
putting
it
into
execution
for
the
present
we
will
keep
the
matter
very
quiet
i
can
assure
you
that
i
always
liked
and
defended
the
abbé
recollect
talking
with
him
and
i
thought
him
a
very
good
fellow
remarked
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
his
wife
silenced
him
with
a
gesture
she
occasionally
treated
him
in
a
very
cavalier
style
truth
to
tell
monsieur
de
condamin
alone
bore
the
shame
attaching
to
the
equivocal
marriage
which
he
was
charged
with
having
made
the
young
woman
whom
he
had
brought
from
no
one
knew
where
had
got
herself
forgiven
and
liked
by
the
whole
town
thanks
to
her
pleasant
ways
and
taking
looks
to
which
provincial
folks
are
more
susceptible
than
might
be
imagined
monsieur
de
condamin
understood
that
he
was
in
the
way
in
this
virtuous
consultation
will
leave
you
to
your
good
designs
he
said
with
a
slight
touch
of
irony
am
going
to
smoke
a
cigar
octavie
do
forget
to
be
dressed
in
good
time
we
are
going
to
the
this
evening
you
know
when
he
had
left
the
room
the
two
women
resumed
their
conversation
for
a
few
moments
longer
returning
to
what
they
had
previously
been
saying
expressing
pity
for
the
poor
girls
who
yielded
to
temptation
and
manifesting
much
anxiety
to
shelter
them
from
danger
madame
de
condamin
inveighed
eloquently
against
vice
then
she
said
as
she
pressed
marthe
hand
for
the
last
time
is
all
settled
and
i
shall
be
entirely
at
your
service
as
soon
as
you
call
for
my
help
if
you
go
to
see
madame
rastoil
and
madame
delangre
tell
them
that
i
will
undertake
to
do
everything
and
that
all
we
want
from
them
is
their
names
my
idea
is
a
good
one
do
you
think
we
wo
depart
a
hair
breadth
from
it
give
my
compliments
to
abbé
faujas
marthe
at
once
proceeded
to
call
upon
madame
delangre
and
then
upon
madame
rastoil
she
found
them
very
polite
but
less
enthusiastic
than
madame
de
condamin
they
discussed
the
pecuniary
side
of
the
scheme
a
large
sum
of
money
would
be
required
they
said
the
charity
of
the
public
would
certainly
never
provide
it
and
there
was
a
great
risk
of
the
whole
business
coming
to
a
ridiculous
termination
marthe
tried
to
reassure
them
and
plied
them
with
figures
then
they
asked
her
what
ladies
had
consented
to
join
the
committee
the
mention
of
madame
de
condamin
name
left
them
silent
but
when
they
learned
that
madame
rougon
had
excused
herself
from
joining
they
became
more
amiable
madame
delangre
had
received
marthe
in
her
husband
private
room
she
was
a
pale
little
woman
whose
dissoluteness
had
remained
a
matter
of
legend
in
plassans
she
ended
by
saying
is
nothing
i
should
like
to
see
better
it
would
be
a
school
of
virtue
for
the
youth
of
the
and
it
would
be
the
means
of
saving
many
weak
souls
i
can
not
refuse
my
assistance
for
i
feel
that
i
could
be
of
much
use
to
you
through
my
husband
who
as
mayor
of
the
town
is
brought
into
continual
contact
with
all
the
influential
people
but
i
must
ask
you
to
allow
me
till
before
i
give
a
definite
reply
our
position
requires
us
to
exercise
circumspection
and
i
should
like
to
consult
monsieur
delangre
in
madame
rastoil
marthe
encountered
a
woman
who
was
equally
listless
but
more
prudish
and
who
sought
for
irreproachable
words
when
referring
to
the
unfortunate
girls
who
had
fallen
she
was
a
sleek
plump
person
and
marthe
found
her
embroidering
a
very
gorgeous
alb
between
her
two
daughters
whom
she
sent
away
at
her
visitor
first
words
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
having
thought
of
me
she
said
really
i
am
very
much
occupied
i
am
already
on
several
committees
and
i
do
know
whether
i
should
have
the
time
i
have
had
some
such
idea
as
your
own
myself
but
my
scheme
was
a
larger
one
and
perhaps
more
complete
and
comprehensive
for
a
whole
month
i
have
been
intending
to
talk
to
the
bishop
about
it
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
the
time
well
we
will
unite
our
efforts
and
i
will
tell
you
my
own
views
for
i
think
you
are
making
a
mistake
in
some
points
since
it
seems
necessary
i
will
surrender
still
more
of
my
time
but
it
was
only
yesterday
that
my
husband
said
to
me
really
you
never
attend
to
your
own
affairs
you
are
always
looking
after
other
people
marthe
glanced
at
her
curiously
thinking
of
her
old
entanglement
with
monsieur
delangre
which
folks
still
chuckled
over
in
the
cafés
of
the
cours
sauvaire
the
wives
of
the
mayor
and
the
presiding
judge
had
received
the
mention
of
abbé
faujas
name
very
suspiciously
the
latter
especially
so
marthe
was
a
little
vexed
at
this
distrust
of
a
person
for
whom
she
vouched
so
she
made
a
point
of
dwelling
upon
the
abbé
good
qualities
and
eventually
forced
the
two
women
to
acknowledge
the
merit
of
this
priest
who
lived
a
life
of
retirement
and
supported
his
mother
on
leaving
madame
rastoil
marthe
merely
had
to
cross
the
road
to
reach
madame
paloque
which
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
rue
balande
it
was
seven
but
she
was
anxious
to
make
this
last
call
even
if
she
were
to
keep
mouret
waiting
for
dinner
and
get
herself
scolded
in
consequence
the
paloques
were
just
about
to
sit
down
to
table
in
a
chilly
whose
prim
coldness
spoke
of
provincial
penury
madame
paloque
hastened
to
cover
up
the
vexed
at
being
thus
found
at
table
she
was
very
polite
humble
almost
anxious
as
she
really
felt
about
this
visit
which
she
had
not
expected
her
husband
the
judge
sat
before
his
empty
plate
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
hussies
he
exclaimed
when
marthe
spoke
of
the
girls
of
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
heard
some
nice
accounts
of
them
at
court
it
was
they
who
led
some
of
our
most
respectable
townspeople
astray
you
do
wrong
madame
to
interest
yourself
about
such
vermin
am
very
much
afraid
said
madame
paloque
in
her
turn
i
can
not
be
of
much
assistance
to
you
i
know
no
one
and
my
husband
would
cut
his
hand
off
rather
than
beg
for
the
smallest
trifle
we
have
held
ourselves
quite
aloof
from
everyone
disgusted
as
we
are
with
all
the
injustices
we
have
witnessed
we
live
here
very
quietly
and
modestly
happy
in
being
forgotten
and
let
alone
even
if
promotion
were
offered
to
my
husband
now
he
would
refuse
it
would
you
my
dear
the
judge
nodded
his
head
in
assent
and
they
exchanged
a
slight
smile
while
marthe
sat
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
that
hideous
wrinkled
couple
livid
with
gall
and
bitterness
who
played
so
well
the
little
comedy
of
feigned
resignation
fortunately
she
recalled
her
counsels
had
quite
counted
upon
you
she
said
making
herself
very
pleasant
shall
have
madame
delangre
madame
rastoil
and
madame
de
condamin
but
between
ourselves
those
ladies
will
only
give
us
their
names
i
should
have
liked
to
find
some
lady
of
good
status
and
kindly
charitable
disposition
who
would
have
taken
a
stronger
interest
and
shown
more
energy
in
the
matter
and
i
thought
that
you
would
be
the
very
person
think
what
gratitude
plassans
would
owe
us
if
we
could
only
bring
such
an
undertaking
to
a
successful
issue
course
of
course
madame
paloque
murmured
quite
delighted
at
marthe
insinuating
words
am
sure
you
are
wrong
in
fancying
that
you
are
without
power
to
assist
us
it
is
very
well
known
that
monsieur
paloque
is
a
favourite
at
the
and
between
ourselves
i
may
say
that
he
is
intended
to
succeed
monsieur
rastoil
ah
now
do
try
to
depreciate
yourselves
your
merits
are
known
and
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
hide
them
this
would
be
a
very
good
opportunity
for
madame
paloque
to
emerge
a
little
from
the
obscurity
and
privacy
in
which
she
keeps
herself
and
to
let
the
world
see
what
a
head
and
what
a
heart
she
has
the
judge
seemed
very
restless
he
looked
at
his
wife
with
blinking
eyes
paloque
has
not
refused
said
he
certainly
not
interposed
the
latter
you
really
stand
in
need
of
me
that
settles
the
matter
i
dare
say
i
am
only
committing
another
piece
of
folly
and
shall
give
myself
a
lot
of
trouble
without
ever
getting
a
word
of
thanks
for
it
monsieur
paloque
can
tell
you
of
all
the
good
works
we
done
without
ever
saying
a
word
about
them
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
they
brought
us
to
well
well
we
ca
change
our
natures
and
i
suppose
we
shall
continue
being
dupes
to
the
end
you
may
count
upon
me
dear
madame
the
paloques
rose
and
marthe
took
leave
of
them
thanking
them
for
their
kindly
interest
as
she
stopped
for
a
moment
on
the
landing
to
liberate
a
flounce
of
her
dress
which
had
caught
between
the
banisters
and
the
steps
she
heard
them
talking
with
animation
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
want
to
enlist
you
because
they
want
to
make
use
of
you
the
judge
was
saying
in
a
bitter
voice
will
be
their
beast
of
burden
course
replied
his
wife
you
may
be
sure
that
i
make
them
pay
for
it
with
the
rest
when
marthe
at
last
got
back
home
it
was
nearly
eight
mouret
had
been
waiting
a
whole
for
his
dinner
and
she
was
afraid
that
there
would
be
a
terrible
scene
but
when
she
had
undressed
and
come
downstairs
she
found
her
husband
seated
astride
an
overturned
chair
tranquilly
beating
a
tattoo
on
the
tablecloth
with
his
fingers
he
was
in
a
very
teasing
bantering
mood
said
he
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
you
were
going
to
spend
the
night
in
a
now
that
you
have
taken
to
going
to
church
you
had
better
give
me
notice
when
the
priests
invite
you
so
that
i
can
dine
out
all
through
the
dinner
he
indulged
in
witticisms
of
this
kind
and
marthe
was
more
distressed
by
them
than
if
he
had
openly
stormed
at
her
two
or
three
times
she
cast
a
glance
at
him
as
if
beseeching
him
to
leave
her
in
peace
but
her
looks
only
appeared
to
stimulate
his
wit
octave
and
désirée
laughed
at
it
all
but
serge
remained
silent
and
mentally
took
his
mother
side
during
dessert
rose
came
into
the
room
looking
quite
scared
with
the
news
that
monsieur
delangre
had
called
and
wished
to
see
madame
have
you
begun
to
associate
with
the
authorities
as
well
exclaimed
mouret
in
his
sneering
fashion
marthe
went
into
the
to
receive
the
mayor
with
much
politeness
the
latter
told
her
that
he
had
felt
unwilling
to
wait
until
the
morrow
to
congratulate
her
upon
her
charitable
idea
madame
delangre
was
a
little
timid
she
had
done
wrong
in
not
immediately
promising
her
and
he
had
now
come
to
say
in
her
name
that
she
would
be
delighted
to
serve
on
the
committee
of
lady
patronesses
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
as
for
himself
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
further
the
success
of
a
scheme
that
would
be
so
useful
so
conducive
to
morality
marthe
accompanied
him
to
the
and
there
as
rose
held
up
the
lamp
to
light
the
footpath
the
mayor
added
you
tell
abbé
faujas
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
him
if
he
will
kindly
call
on
me
as
he
has
had
experience
of
an
establishment
of
this
kind
at
besançon
he
will
be
able
to
give
me
valuable
information
i
mean
the
town
to
pay
for
the
building
at
any
rate
dear
madame
give
my
best
compliments
to
monsieur
mouret
whom
i
wo
disturb
when
abbé
faujas
came
down
with
his
mother
at
eight
mouret
merely
said
to
him
with
a
laugh
you
walked
my
wife
off
eh
well
do
spoil
her
for
me
too
much
and
do
make
a
saint
of
her
then
he
turned
to
his
he
was
anxious
to
revenge
himself
on
madame
faujas
who
had
defeated
him
three
evenings
in
succession
and
so
marthe
was
left
free
to
tell
the
abbé
of
all
she
had
done
during
the
day
she
seemed
full
of
pleasure
and
was
still
quite
excited
with
her
afternoon
the
priest
made
her
repeat
certain
details
and
then
promised
to
call
on
monsieur
delangre
although
he
would
have
preferred
remaining
altogether
in
the
background
did
wrong
to
mention
my
name
at
all
he
said
when
he
saw
her
so
moved
and
yielding
you
are
like
all
other
women
the
best
causes
would
be
spoilt
in
your
hands
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
at
this
harsh
exclamation
recoiling
and
feeling
that
thrill
of
fear
which
she
still
occasionally
experienced
in
the
presence
of
his
cassock
it
was
as
though
iron
hands
were
being
laid
upon
her
shoulders
and
were
forcing
her
into
compliance
with
their
will
every
priest
looks
upon
woman
as
an
enemy
but
when
the
abbé
saw
that
she
was
hurt
by
his
stern
reproof
he
softened
his
voice
and
said
think
only
of
the
success
of
your
noble
design
i
am
afraid
that
i
should
compromise
it
if
i
myself
were
to
appear
in
it
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
not
a
favourite
in
the
town
marthe
seeing
him
so
humble
assured
him
that
he
was
mistaken
and
that
all
the
ladies
had
spoken
of
him
in
the
highest
terms
they
knew
that
he
was
supporting
his
mother
and
that
he
led
a
quiet
retired
life
worthy
of
the
greatest
praise
then
they
talked
over
the
great
scheme
dwelling
on
the
smallest
details
of
it
till
eleven
struck
it
was
a
delightful
evening
mouret
had
caught
a
word
or
two
of
the
talk
every
now
and
then
between
the
deals
so
he
said
as
they
were
going
to
bed
you
two
are
going
to
stamp
out
vice
it
a
fine
invention
three
days
later
the
committee
of
patronesses
was
formally
constituted
the
ladies
having
elected
marthe
as
president
she
upon
her
advice
which
she
had
privately
sought
immediately
named
madame
paloque
treasurer
they
both
gave
themselves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
directing
circulars
and
looking
after
a
host
of
other
petty
details
in
the
meantime
madame
de
condamin
went
from
the
to
the
bishop
and
from
the
bishop
to
the
houses
of
various
other
influential
persons
exhibiting
some
lovely
toilettes
explaining
in
her
pretty
fashion
happy
idea
that
had
occurred
to
her
and
carrying
off
subscriptions
and
promises
of
assistance
madame
rastoil
on
the
other
hand
told
the
priests
who
came
to
her
house
on
the
tuesday
how
she
had
formed
a
plan
for
rescuing
unfortunate
girls
from
vice
and
then
contented
herself
with
charging
abbé
bourrette
to
inquire
of
the
sisters
of
if
they
would
come
and
serve
in
the
projected
refuge
while
madame
delangre
confided
to
a
little
company
of
functionaries
that
the
town
was
indebted
for
the
home
to
her
husband
who
had
also
kindly
given
the
committee
the
use
of
a
room
at
the
where
they
could
meet
and
deliberate
at
their
ease
plassans
was
speedily
excited
by
this
pious
turmoil
and
soon
nothing
but
the
home
of
the
virgin
was
spoken
of
a
chorus
of
praise
went
up
and
the
friends
of
each
lady
patroness
made
up
little
parties
and
worked
strenuously
for
the
success
of
the
undertaking
within
a
week
subscriptions
were
opened
in
all
three
quarters
of
the
town
and
as
the
gazette
published
lists
of
the
subscriptions
a
feeling
of
pride
was
awakened
and
the
most
notable
families
vied
as
to
which
should
be
the
most
generous
amidst
all
the
talk
on
the
subject
abbé
faujas
name
frequently
cropped
up
although
each
of
the
lady
patronesses
claimed
the
idea
of
the
refuge
as
her
own
there
was
a
prevailing
belief
that
it
was
the
abbé
who
had
brought
it
with
him
from
besançon
monsieur
delangre
indeed
made
an
express
statement
to
that
effect
at
the
meeting
of
the
municipal
council
when
it
was
decided
to
purchase
the
building
which
the
diocesan
architect
had
suggested
as
being
best
suited
to
the
requirements
of
the
home
on
the
previous
evening
the
mayor
had
had
a
lengthy
conversation
with
the
priest
they
had
shaken
hands
most
cordially
on
parting
and
the
mayor
secretary
had
even
heard
them
call
each
other
dear
sir
this
brought
about
quite
a
revolution
in
the
abbé
favour
from
that
time
he
had
a
group
of
partisans
who
defended
him
against
the
attacks
of
his
enemies
besides
the
mourets
vouched
for
abbé
faujas
respectability
supported
by
marthe
friendship
recognised
as
the
originator
of
a
good
work
which
he
modestly
refused
to
acknowledge
as
his
own
he
no
longer
manifested
in
the
streets
that
appearance
of
humility
which
had
led
him
to
withdraw
as
much
as
possible
from
observation
by
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
he
bravely
showed
his
new
cassock
in
the
sun
and
walked
in
the
middle
of
the
road
on
his
way
from
the
rue
balande
to
he
now
had
to
return
a
great
number
of
bows
one
sunday
madame
de
condamin
stopped
him
after
vespers
on
the
place
in
front
of
the
bishop
house
and
kept
him
talking
with
her
there
for
a
good
your
reverence
mouret
said
to
him
with
a
laugh
are
quite
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
now
one
would
scarcely
have
anticipated
that
six
months
ago
when
i
was
the
only
one
to
say
a
good
word
for
you
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
trust
too
much
to
it
all
you
still
have
the
bishop
set
against
you
the
priest
lightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
knew
quite
well
that
what
hostility
he
still
met
with
came
from
the
clergy
abbé
fenil
kept
monseigneur
rousselot
trembling
beneath
his
rough
hard
will
however
when
the
about
the
end
of
march
left
plassans
on
a
short
holiday
abbé
faujas
profited
by
his
absence
to
make
several
calls
upon
the
bishop
abbé
surin
the
prelate
private
secretary
reported
that
the
man
had
been
closeted
for
hours
with
his
lordship
who
had
manifested
an
atrocious
temper
after
each
interview
when
abbé
fenil
returned
abbé
faujas
discontinued
his
visits
and
again
drew
into
the
background
but
the
bishop
still
showed
himself
very
much
disturbed
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
something
had
occurred
to
upset
his
careless
mind
at
a
dinner
which
he
gave
to
his
clergy
he
showed
himself
particularly
friendly
to
abbé
faujas
who
was
still
only
a
humble
curate
at
abbé
fenil
then
kept
his
thin
lips
more
tightly
closed
than
ever
but
inwardly
cursed
his
penitents
when
they
politely
asked
him
how
he
was
in
health
and
now
at
last
abbé
faujas
manifested
complete
serenity
he
still
led
a
life
but
he
seemed
permeated
by
a
pleasant
ease
of
mind
one
tuesday
evening
he
triumphed
definitively
he
was
looking
out
of
the
window
of
his
room
enjoying
the
early
warmth
of
springtide
when
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
guests
came
into
the
garden
of
the
and
bowed
to
him
from
a
distance
madame
de
condamin
was
there
and
carried
her
familiarity
so
far
as
to
wave
her
handkerchief
to
him
just
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
side
some
guests
came
to
sit
on
the
rustic
seats
in
front
of
the
waterfall
in
monsieur
grounds
monsieur
delangre
who
was
leaning
over
the
terrace
of
the
could
see
across
mouret
garden
into
the
place
owing
to
the
sloping
character
of
the
ground
will
see
he
said
wo
deign
even
to
notice
him
but
he
was
wrong
for
abbé
fenil
having
turned
his
head
as
though
by
chance
took
off
his
hat
whereupon
all
the
other
priests
who
happened
to
be
present
did
the
same
and
abbé
faujas
returned
their
salute
then
after
slowly
glancing
over
the
two
sets
of
guests
on
his
right
and
his
left
he
quitted
his
window
carefully
drawing
his
white
and
curtains
ix
the
month
of
april
was
very
mild
and
warm
and
in
the
evenings
after
dinner
the
young
mourets
went
to
amuse
themselves
in
the
garden
marthe
and
the
priest
too
as
they
found
the
become
very
close
also
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
they
sat
a
few
steps
from
the
open
window
just
outside
the
stream
of
light
which
the
lamp
cast
upon
the
tall
box
hedges
hid
there
in
the
deepening
dusk
they
discussed
all
the
little
details
connected
with
the
home
of
the
virgin
this
constant
discussion
of
charitable
matters
seemed
to
give
a
tone
of
additional
softness
to
their
conversation
in
front
of
them
between
monsieur
rastoil
huge
and
the
dusky
chestnuts
of
the
there
was
a
large
patch
of
open
sky
the
young
people
sported
about
under
the
arbours
while
every
now
and
then
the
voices
of
mouret
and
madame
faujas
who
remained
alone
in
the
deeply
absorbed
in
their
game
could
be
heard
raised
in
passing
altercations
sometimes
marthe
full
of
tender
emotion
a
gentle
languor
that
made
her
words
fall
slowly
from
her
lips
would
check
her
speech
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
golden
train
of
some
shooting
star
and
smile
as
she
threw
back
her
head
a
little
and
looked
up
at
the
heavens
another
soul
leaving
purgatory
and
entering
paradise
she
murmured
while
as
the
priest
kept
silent
she
added
pretty
they
are
those
little
beliefs
one
ought
to
be
able
to
remain
a
little
girl
your
reverence
she
no
longer
now
mended
the
family
linen
in
the
evening
she
would
have
had
to
light
a
lamp
on
the
terrace
to
see
to
do
it
and
she
preferred
the
gloom
of
the
warm
night
which
seemed
to
thrill
her
with
peaceful
happiness
besides
she
now
went
out
every
day
which
fatigued
her
and
when
dinner
was
over
she
had
not
energy
enough
to
take
up
her
needle
rose
had
been
obliged
to
undertake
the
mending
as
mouret
was
beginning
to
complain
that
his
socks
were
all
in
holes
to
tell
the
truth
marthe
was
really
very
much
occupied
besides
the
committee
meetings
over
which
she
presided
she
had
numerous
other
things
to
attend
to
visits
to
make
and
superintendence
duties
to
exercise
she
deputed
much
necessary
writing
and
other
little
matters
to
madame
paloque
but
she
was
so
eager
to
see
the
home
actually
established
that
she
went
off
to
the
faubourg
where
the
building
stood
three
times
a
week
to
make
sure
that
the
workmen
were
not
wasting
their
time
whenever
she
thought
that
satisfactory
progress
was
not
being
made
she
hurried
to
to
find
the
architect
and
grumbled
to
him
and
begged
him
not
to
leave
the
men
without
his
supervision
growing
quite
jealous
indeed
of
the
work
which
was
being
executed
in
the
church
and
saying
that
the
chapel
repairs
were
being
much
too
quickly
pushed
forward
monsieur
lieutaud
smiled
at
all
this
and
assured
her
that
everything
would
be
completed
within
the
stipulated
time
but
abbé
faujas
likewise
protested
that
sufficient
progress
was
not
being
made
and
urged
marthe
to
give
the
architect
no
peace
so
she
ended
by
going
to
every
day
she
went
thither
with
her
brain
full
of
figures
or
absorbed
in
thinking
of
walls
that
had
to
be
pulled
down
and
rebuilt
the
chilliness
of
the
church
cooled
her
excitement
a
little
she
dipped
her
fingers
in
the
holy
water
and
crossed
herself
by
way
of
doing
as
others
did
the
vergers
grew
to
know
her
and
bow
to
her
and
she
herself
became
quite
familiar
with
the
different
chapels
and
the
sacristy
whither
she
sometimes
had
to
go
in
search
of
abbé
faujas
and
the
wide
corridor
and
low
cloisters
through
which
she
had
to
pass
at
the
end
of
a
month
there
was
not
a
corner
in
which
she
did
not
know
sometimes
she
had
to
wait
for
the
architect
and
then
she
would
sit
down
in
some
retired
chapel
and
rest
after
her
hurried
walk
recapitulating
in
her
mind
the
host
of
things
which
she
wanted
to
impress
upon
monsieur
lieutaud
the
deep
palpitating
silence
which
surrounded
her
and
the
dim
religious
light
falling
from
the
windows
gradually
plunged
her
into
a
vague
soft
reverie
she
began
to
love
the
lofty
arches
and
the
solemn
bareness
of
the
walls
the
altars
draped
in
protecting
covers
and
the
chairs
all
arranged
in
order
as
soon
indeed
as
the
padded
doors
swung
to
behind
her
she
began
to
experience
a
feeling
of
supreme
restfulness
she
forgot
all
the
weary
cares
of
the
world
and
perfect
peace
permeated
her
being
is
such
a
pleasant
place
she
said
in
an
unguarded
moment
one
evening
before
her
husband
after
a
close
sultry
day
you
like
us
to
go
and
sleep
there
mouret
asked
with
a
laugh
marthe
felt
hurt
the
feeling
of
purely
physical
happiness
which
she
experienced
in
the
church
began
to
distress
her
as
being
something
wrong
and
it
was
with
a
slight
feeling
of
trouble
that
she
thenceforward
entered
trying
to
force
herself
to
remain
indifferent
and
uninfluenced
by
her
surroundings
just
as
she
would
have
been
in
the
big
rooms
at
the
town
hall
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
deeply
distressfully
affected
it
was
however
a
distress
to
which
she
willingly
returned
abbé
faujas
manifested
no
consciousness
of
the
slow
awakening
which
every
day
went
on
within
her
he
still
retained
with
her
the
demeanour
of
a
busy
obliging
man
putting
heaven
on
one
side
he
never
showed
anything
of
the
priest
sometimes
however
she
would
disturb
him
as
he
was
going
to
read
the
burial
office
and
he
would
then
speak
to
her
for
a
moment
between
a
couple
of
pillars
in
his
surplice
which
exhaled
a
vague
odour
of
incense
and
wax
tapers
it
was
frequently
a
mere
bricklayer
bill
or
some
carpenter
claim
that
they
spoke
about
and
the
priest
would
just
tell
her
the
exact
figures
and
then
hurry
away
to
attend
to
the
funeral
she
remaining
there
lingering
in
the
empty
nave
while
one
of
the
vergers
was
extinguishing
the
candles
as
faujas
when
he
crossed
the
church
with
her
bowed
before
the
high
altar
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
doing
likewise
at
first
out
of
a
feeling
of
mere
propriety
but
afterwards
the
action
had
become
mechanical
and
she
now
bowed
when
she
was
quite
alone
hitherto
this
act
of
reverence
had
been
her
only
sign
of
devotion
two
or
three
times
she
had
come
to
the
church
on
days
of
high
ceremonial
of
which
she
had
not
previously
been
aware
but
when
she
saw
the
church
was
full
of
worshippers
and
heard
the
pealing
of
the
organ
she
hurried
off
thrilled
with
sudden
fear
and
not
daring
to
cross
the
threshold
mouret
would
frequently
ask
her
with
his
sniggering
laugh
do
you
mean
to
take
your
first
communion
he
was
perpetually
teasing
her
but
she
never
replied
simply
fixing
upon
him
the
gaze
of
her
eyes
in
which
a
passing
brightness
glistened
when
he
went
too
far
by
degrees
he
became
more
bitter
he
was
tired
of
mocking
at
her
and
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
quite
lost
his
temper
sense
is
there
in
going
and
mixing
yourself
up
with
a
lot
of
priests
he
would
growl
at
times
when
his
dinner
was
not
ready
when
he
wanted
it
are
always
away
from
home
now
there
no
keeping
you
in
the
house
for
an
hour
at
a
time
i
should
mind
it
myself
if
everything
were
going
to
pieces
here
i
never
get
any
of
my
things
mended
the
table
is
not
even
laid
by
seven
there
no
making
anything
out
of
rose
and
the
whole
place
is
left
to
rack
and
ruin
he
picked
up
a
that
was
lying
about
locked
up
a
bottle
of
wine
that
had
been
left
out
and
began
to
wipe
the
dust
off
the
furniture
with
his
fingers
working
himself
up
to
a
higher
pitch
of
anger
as
he
cried
soon
be
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
take
up
a
broom
and
put
an
apron
on
you
would
see
me
do
it
without
disturbing
yourself
i
know
i
might
do
all
the
work
of
the
house
without
your
being
any
the
wiser
for
it
indeed
do
you
know
that
i
spent
a
couple
of
hours
this
morning
in
putting
this
cupboard
in
order
no
no
things
ca
go
on
any
longer
in
this
way
at
other
times
there
was
a
disturbance
about
the
children
once
when
mouret
came
home
he
found
désirée
like
a
young
pig
in
the
garden
lying
on
her
stomach
before
an
and
trying
to
find
out
what
the
ants
might
be
doing
in
the
ground
may
be
very
thankful
i
sure
that
you
do
sleep
away
from
the
house
as
well
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
wife
and
look
at
your
daughter
i
would
let
her
change
her
dress
because
i
wished
that
you
might
see
what
a
pretty
sight
she
is
the
girl
cried
bitterly
while
her
father
kept
turning
her
round
at
her
now
is
she
a
nice
spectacle
this
is
the
way
children
go
on
when
they
are
left
to
themselves
it
is
her
fault
poor
little
innocent
at
one
time
you
could
leave
her
alone
for
five
minutes
she
would
be
getting
into
the
fire
you
said
well
i
expect
she
will
be
getting
into
the
fire
now
and
everything
will
be
burnt
up
and
then
there
be
an
end
of
it
all
when
rose
had
taken
désirée
away
he
continued
live
now
simply
for
other
people
children
you
do
give
a
moment
to
your
own
what
a
goose
you
must
be
to
go
knocking
yourself
up
for
a
parcel
of
hussies
who
only
laugh
at
you
go
and
walk
about
the
ramparts
any
evening
and
you
will
see
something
of
the
conduct
of
those
impudent
creatures
whom
you
talk
of
putting
under
the
protection
of
the
virgin
he
stopped
to
take
breath
and
then
went
on
again
all
events
see
that
désirée
is
properly
taken
care
of
before
you
go
picking
up
girls
from
the
gutter
there
are
holes
as
big
as
my
fist
in
her
dress
one
of
these
days
we
shall
be
finding
her
in
the
garden
with
a
leg
or
an
arm
broken
i
do
say
anything
about
octave
or
serge
though
i
should
much
prefer
your
being
at
home
when
they
come
back
from
college
they
are
up
to
all
kinds
of
diabolical
tricks
only
yesterday
they
split
a
couple
of
on
the
terrace
by
letting
off
crackers
i
tell
you
that
if
you
do
keep
yourself
at
home
we
shall
find
the
whole
house
blown
to
bits
one
of
these
days
marthe
said
a
few
words
in
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
she
urged
there
was
no
doubt
that
mouret
who
possessed
an
ample
fund
of
common
sense
in
spite
of
his
proclivities
for
teasing
and
jeering
was
right
the
house
was
getting
into
a
most
unsatisfactory
state
that
once
quiet
spot
indeed
where
the
sun
had
set
so
peacefully
was
becoming
uproarious
left
to
look
after
itself
suffering
from
the
children
noisiness
the
father
bursts
of
temper
and
the
mother
careless
indifferent
lassitude
in
the
evening
at
table
they
dined
badly
and
quarrelled
amongst
themselves
rose
did
just
what
she
liked
and
she
by
the
way
was
of
opinion
that
her
mistress
was
quite
in
the
right
matters
came
to
such
a
pass
at
last
that
mouret
happening
to
meet
his
complained
to
her
bitterly
of
marthe
conduct
although
he
was
quite
aware
of
the
pleasure
he
afforded
the
old
lady
by
revealing
to
her
the
troubles
of
his
home
astonish
me
extremely
félicité
replied
with
a
smile
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
afraid
of
you
and
i
considered
her
even
too
yielding
and
obedient
a
woman
ought
not
to
tremble
before
her
husband
yes
indeed
cried
mouret
with
a
hopeless
look
upon
a
time
she
would
have
sunk
into
the
ground
to
avoid
a
quarrel
a
mere
glance
was
sufficient
to
make
her
do
everything
i
desired
but
that
all
quite
altered
now
i
may
remonstrate
and
shout
as
much
as
i
like
she
still
goes
her
own
way
she
does
reply
she
has
as
yet
got
to
flying
out
at
me
but
that
will
come
as
well
i
dare
say
félicité
then
answered
with
some
hypocrisy
will
speak
to
marthe
if
you
like
but
it
might
perhaps
hurt
her
if
i
did
matters
of
this
kind
are
better
kept
between
husband
and
wife
i
do
feel
very
uneasy
about
them
i
no
doubt
that
you
soon
get
back
again
all
the
quiet
peacefulness
which
you
used
to
be
so
proud
of
mouret
shook
his
head
with
downcast
eyes
no
he
said
know
myself
too
well
i
can
make
a
noise
but
it
does
no
good
in
reality
i
am
as
weak
as
a
child
people
are
quite
wrong
in
supposing
that
i
gained
my
own
way
with
my
wife
by
force
she
has
generally
done
what
i
wanted
her
to
do
because
she
was
quite
indifferent
about
everything
and
would
as
soon
do
one
thing
as
another
mild
as
she
looks
she
is
very
obstinate
i
can
tell
you
well
i
must
try
to
make
the
best
of
it
then
raising
his
eyes
he
added
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
said
nothing
about
all
this
to
you
but
you
wo
mention
it
to
anyone
will
you
when
marthe
went
to
see
her
mother
the
next
day
the
latter
received
her
with
some
show
of
coldness
and
exclaimed
is
wrong
of
you
my
dear
to
show
yourself
so
neglectful
of
your
husband
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
he
is
quite
angry
about
it
i
am
well
aware
that
he
often
behaves
in
a
very
ridiculous
manner
but
that
does
not
justify
you
in
neglecting
your
home
marthe
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
mother
he
has
been
complaining
about
me
she
said
curtly
least
he
could
do
would
be
to
keep
silent
for
i
never
complain
about
him
then
she
began
to
talk
of
other
matters
but
madame
rougon
brought
her
back
to
the
subject
of
her
husband
by
inquiring
after
abbé
faujas
mouret
is
very
fond
of
the
abbé
and
finds
fault
with
you
in
consequence
is
that
the
case
do
you
think
marthe
showed
great
surprise
an
idea
she
exclaimed
makes
you
think
that
my
husband
does
not
like
abbé
faujas
he
has
certainly
never
said
anything
to
me
which
would
lead
me
to
imagine
such
a
thing
he
has
said
anything
to
you
has
he
oh
no
you
are
quite
mistaken
he
would
go
up
to
their
rooms
to
fetch
them
if
the
mother
did
come
down
to
have
her
game
of
cards
with
him
mouret
indeed
never
complained
in
any
way
about
abbé
faujas
he
joked
with
him
a
little
bluntly
sometimes
and
occasionally
brought
his
name
into
the
teasing
banter
with
which
he
tormented
his
wife
but
that
was
all
one
morning
as
he
was
shaving
he
said
to
marthe
tell
you
what
my
dear
if
ever
you
go
to
confession
take
the
abbé
for
your
director
and
then
your
sins
will
at
any
rate
be
kept
amongst
ourselves
abbé
faujas
heard
confessions
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
on
which
days
marthe
used
to
avoid
going
to
she
alleged
that
she
did
not
want
to
disturb
him
but
she
was
really
under
the
influence
of
that
timid
uneasiness
which
disquieted
her
whenever
she
saw
him
in
his
surplice
redolent
of
the
mysterious
odours
of
the
sacristy
one
friday
she
went
with
madame
de
condamin
to
see
how
the
works
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
were
getting
on
the
men
were
just
finishing
the
frontage
madame
de
condamin
found
fault
with
the
ornamentation
which
said
she
was
extremely
mean
and
characterless
at
the
entrance
there
ought
to
have
been
two
slender
columns
with
a
pointed
arch
something
at
once
light
and
suggestive
of
religion
something
that
would
be
a
credit
to
the
committee
of
lady
patronesses
marthe
hesitated
for
a
time
but
she
gradually
admitted
that
the
place
looked
very
mean
as
it
was
then
as
the
other
pressed
her
she
promised
to
speak
to
monsieur
lieutaud
on
the
subject
that
very
day
in
order
that
she
might
keep
her
promise
she
went
to
the
cathedral
before
returning
home
it
was
four
when
she
got
there
and
the
architect
had
just
left
when
she
asked
for
abbé
faujas
a
verger
told
her
that
he
was
confessing
in
the
chapel
of
saint
aurelia
then
for
the
first
time
she
recollected
what
day
it
was
and
replied
that
she
could
not
wait
but
as
she
passed
the
chapel
of
saint
aurelia
on
her
way
out
she
thought
that
the
abbé
might
perhaps
have
already
caught
sight
of
her
the
truth
was
that
she
felt
singularly
faint
and
so
she
sat
down
outside
the
chapel
near
the
railing
and
there
she
remained
the
sky
was
grey
and
the
church
was
steeped
in
twilight
here
and
there
in
the
aisles
already
shrouded
in
darkness
gleamed
a
lamp
or
some
gilt
candelabrum
or
some
virgin
silver
robe
and
a
pale
ray
filtered
through
the
great
nave
and
died
away
on
the
polished
oak
of
the
stalls
and
benches
marthe
had
never
before
felt
so
completely
overcome
her
legs
seemed
to
have
lost
all
their
strength
and
her
hands
were
so
heavy
that
she
clasped
them
across
her
knees
to
save
herself
from
having
to
support
their
weight
she
allowed
herself
to
drift
into
drowsiness
in
which
she
still
continued
to
hear
and
see
but
in
a
very
soft
subdued
fashion
the
slight
sounds
wafted
along
beneath
the
vaulted
roof
the
falling
of
a
chair
the
slow
step
of
some
worshipper
all
filled
her
with
emotion
assumed
a
musical
tone
which
thrilled
her
to
the
heart
while
the
last
glimmers
of
daylight
and
the
dusky
shadows
that
crept
up
the
pillars
like
covers
of
crape
assumed
in
her
eyes
all
the
delicate
tints
of
shot
silk
she
gradually
fell
into
a
state
of
exquisite
languor
in
which
she
seemed
to
melt
away
and
die
everything
around
her
then
vanished
and
she
was
thrilled
with
perfect
happiness
in
her
strange
condition
the
sound
of
a
voice
awoke
her
from
this
state
of
ecstasy
am
very
sorry
said
abbé
faujas
saw
you
but
i
could
not
get
away
she
then
appeared
to
wake
up
with
a
start
she
looked
at
him
he
was
standing
before
her
in
the
dying
light
in
his
surplice
his
last
penitent
had
just
left
and
the
empty
church
seemed
to
be
growing
still
more
solemn
want
to
speak
to
me
he
asked
marthe
made
an
effort
to
recall
her
thoughts
she
murmured
i
ca
remember
now
ah
yes
it
is
about
the
frontage
which
madame
de
condamin
thinks
too
mean
there
ought
to
be
two
columns
instead
of
that
characterless
flat
door
and
up
above
one
might
put
a
pointed
arch
filled
with
stained
glass
it
would
look
very
pretty
you
understand
what
i
mean
do
you
he
gazed
at
her
very
gravely
with
his
hands
crossed
over
his
surplice
and
his
head
inclined
towards
her
and
she
still
seated
without
strength
to
rise
to
her
feet
went
on
stammering
confusedly
as
though
she
had
been
taken
unawares
in
a
sleep
which
she
could
not
shake
off
would
entail
additional
expense
of
course
but
we
might
have
columns
of
soft
stone
with
a
very
simple
moulding
we
might
speak
about
it
to
the
master
mason
and
he
will
tell
us
how
much
it
would
cost
but
we
had
better
pay
him
his
last
account
first
it
is
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
odd
francs
i
think
we
have
the
money
in
hand
madame
paloque
told
me
so
this
morning
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
that
monsieur
she
lowered
her
head
as
though
she
felt
oppressed
by
the
gaze
that
was
bent
upon
her
when
she
raised
it
again
and
met
the
priest
eyes
she
clasped
her
hands
together
after
the
manner
of
a
child
seeking
forgiveness
and
she
burst
into
sobs
the
priest
allowed
her
to
weep
still
standing
in
silence
in
front
of
her
then
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
weeping
behind
her
hands
with
which
she
covered
her
face
up
i
pray
you
said
abbé
faujas
gently
is
before
god
that
you
should
go
and
kneel
he
helped
her
to
rise
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
they
talked
together
for
a
long
time
in
low
tones
the
night
had
now
fully
fallen
and
the
lamps
set
golden
specks
gleaming
through
the
black
depths
of
the
church
the
murmur
of
their
voices
alone
disturbed
the
silence
in
front
of
the
chapel
of
saint
aurelia
from
the
priest
streamed
a
flood
of
words
after
each
of
marthe
weak
broken
answers
when
at
last
they
rose
he
seemed
to
be
refusing
her
some
favour
which
she
was
seeking
with
persistence
and
leading
her
towards
the
door
he
raised
his
voice
as
he
said
i
can
not
i
assure
you
i
can
not
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
take
abbé
bourrette
am
in
great
need
of
your
advice
marthe
murmured
beseechingly
think
that
with
your
help
everything
would
be
easy
to
me
are
mistaken
he
replied
in
a
sterner
voice
the
contrary
i
fear
that
my
direction
would
be
prejudicial
to
you
to
begin
with
abbé
bourrette
is
the
priest
you
want
i
assure
you
later
on
i
may
perhaps
give
you
a
different
reply
marthe
obeyed
the
priest
injunctions
and
on
the
morrow
the
worshippers
at
were
surprised
to
see
madame
mouret
kneel
before
abbé
bourrette
confessional
two
days
later
nothing
but
this
conversion
was
spoken
of
in
plassans
abbé
faujas
name
was
pronounced
with
subtle
smiles
by
certain
people
but
on
the
whole
the
impression
was
a
good
one
and
in
favour
of
the
abbé
madame
rastoil
complimented
madame
mouret
in
full
committee
and
madame
delangre
professed
to
see
in
the
matter
a
first
blessing
vouchsafed
by
god
who
rewarded
the
lady
patronesses
for
their
good
work
by
touching
the
heart
of
the
only
one
amongst
them
who
had
not
conformed
with
the
requirements
of
religion
madame
de
condamin
taking
marthe
aside
said
to
her
have
done
right
my
dear
what
you
have
done
is
a
necessity
for
a
woman
and
besides
as
soon
as
one
begins
to
go
about
a
little
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
church
the
only
matter
of
astonishment
was
her
choice
of
abbé
bourrette
that
worthy
man
almost
entirely
confined
himself
to
hearing
the
confessions
of
young
girls
the
ladies
found
him
very
uninteresting
on
the
thursday
at
the
rougons
reception
before
marthe
arrival
the
matter
was
talked
over
in
a
corner
of
the
green
and
it
was
madame
paloque
with
her
waspish
tongue
who
summed
up
the
matter
faujas
has
done
quite
right
in
not
keeping
her
himself
said
she
with
a
twist
of
her
mouth
that
made
her
still
more
hideous
than
usual
bourrette
is
very
successful
in
saving
souls
and
appearances
also
when
marthe
came
that
evening
her
mother
stepped
forward
to
welcome
her
and
kissed
her
affectionately
with
some
ostentation
before
the
company
she
herself
had
made
her
peace
with
god
on
the
morrow
of
the
coup
she
was
of
opinion
that
abbé
faujas
might
now
venture
to
return
to
the
green
but
he
excused
himself
making
a
pretext
of
his
work
and
his
love
of
privacy
madame
rougon
then
fancied
that
he
was
planning
a
triumphal
return
for
the
following
winter
the
abbé
success
was
certainly
on
the
increase
for
the
first
few
months
his
only
penitents
had
come
from
the
held
behind
the
cathedral
poor
hawkers
to
whose
dialect
he
had
quietly
listened
without
always
being
able
to
understand
it
but
now
especially
since
all
the
talk
there
had
been
in
connection
with
the
home
of
the
virgin
he
had
a
crowd
of
citizens
wives
and
daughters
dressed
in
silk
kneeling
before
his
when
marthe
quietly
mentioned
that
he
would
not
receive
her
amongst
his
penitents
madame
de
condamin
was
seized
with
a
sudden
whim
and
deserted
her
director
the
senior
curate
of
who
was
greatly
distressed
thereby
to
transfer
the
guardianship
of
her
soul
to
abbé
faujas
such
a
distinction
as
this
gave
the
latter
a
firm
position
in
plassans
society
when
mouret
learned
that
his
wife
now
went
to
confession
he
merely
said
to
her
have
been
doing
something
wrong
lately
i
suppose
since
you
find
it
necessary
to
go
and
tell
all
your
affairs
to
a
parson
in
the
midst
of
all
this
pious
excitement
he
seemed
to
isolate
himself
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
narrow
and
monotonous
life
still
further
when
his
wife
reproached
him
for
complaining
to
her
mother
he
answered
you
are
right
it
was
wrong
of
me
it
is
foolish
to
give
people
any
pleasure
by
telling
them
of
one
troubles
however
i
promise
you
that
i
wo
give
your
mother
this
satisfaction
a
second
time
i
have
been
thinking
matters
over
and
the
house
may
topple
down
on
our
heads
before
i
go
whimpering
to
anyone
again
from
that
time
he
never
made
any
disparaging
remarks
about
the
management
of
the
house
or
scolded
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
strangers
but
professed
himself
as
formerly
the
happiest
of
men
this
effort
of
sound
sense
cost
him
little
for
he
saw
that
it
would
tend
to
his
comfort
which
was
the
object
of
his
constant
thoughts
he
even
exaggerated
his
assumption
of
the
part
of
a
contented
methodical
citizen
who
took
pleasure
in
living
marthe
only
became
aware
of
his
impatience
by
his
restless
pacing
up
and
down
for
whole
weeks
he
refrained
from
teasing
or
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
while
upon
rose
and
his
children
he
constantly
poured
forth
his
jeers
scolding
them
too
from
morning
till
night
for
the
slightest
shortcomings
previously
he
had
only
been
economical
now
he
became
miserly
is
no
sense
in
spending
money
in
the
way
we
are
doing
he
grumbled
to
marthe
be
bound
you
are
giving
it
all
to
those
young
hussies
of
yours
but
it
quite
sufficient
for
you
to
waste
your
time
over
them
listen
to
me
my
dear
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
francs
a
month
for
housekeeping
and
if
you
will
persist
in
giving
money
to
girls
who
do
deserve
it
you
must
save
it
out
of
your
dress
allowance
he
kept
firmly
to
his
word
and
the
very
next
month
he
refused
to
let
marthe
buy
a
pair
of
boots
on
the
pretext
that
it
would
disarrange
his
accounts
and
that
he
had
given
her
full
notice
and
warning
one
evening
his
wife
found
him
weeping
bitterly
in
their
bedroom
all
her
kindness
of
heart
was
aroused
and
she
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
besought
him
to
tell
her
what
distressed
him
but
he
roughly
tore
himself
away
from
her
and
told
her
that
he
was
not
crying
at
all
but
simply
had
a
bad
headache
it
was
that
said
he
which
made
his
eyes
red
you
think
he
exclaimed
i
am
such
a
simpleton
as
you
are
to
cry
she
felt
much
hurt
the
next
day
mouret
affected
great
gaiety
but
some
days
afterwards
when
abbé
faujas
and
his
mother
came
downstairs
after
dinner
he
refused
to
play
his
usual
game
of
piquet
he
did
not
feel
enough
for
it
he
said
on
the
next
few
nights
he
made
other
excuses
and
so
the
games
were
broken
off
and
everyone
went
out
on
the
terrace
mouret
seated
himself
in
front
of
his
wife
and
the
abbé
doing
all
he
could
to
speak
as
much
and
as
frequently
as
possible
while
madame
faujas
sat
a
few
yards
away
in
the
gloom
quite
silent
and
still
with
her
hands
upon
her
knees
like
one
of
those
legendary
figures
keeping
guard
over
a
treasure
with
the
stern
fidelity
of
a
crouching
dog
evening
mouret
used
to
say
every
night
is
much
pleasanter
here
than
in
the
it
is
very
wise
of
you
to
come
out
and
enjoy
the
fresh
air
ah
there
a
did
your
reverence
see
it
i
heard
say
that
it
saint
peter
lighting
his
pipe
up
yonder
he
laughed
but
marthe
kept
quite
grave
vexed
by
his
attempts
at
pleasantry
which
spoilt
her
enjoyment
of
the
expanse
of
sky
that
spread
between
monsieur
rastoil
and
the
chestnuts
of
the
sometimes
he
would
pretend
to
be
unaware
that
she
conformed
with
the
requirements
of
religion
and
he
would
take
the
abbé
aside
and
tell
him
that
he
relied
on
him
to
effect
the
salvation
of
the
whole
house
at
other
times
he
could
never
begin
a
sentence
without
saying
in
a
bantering
tone
that
my
wife
goes
to
confession
then
having
grown
tired
of
this
subject
he
began
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
in
the
neighbouring
gardens
trying
to
catch
the
faint
sounds
of
voices
which
rose
in
the
calm
night
air
as
the
distant
noises
of
plassans
were
hushed
those
are
the
voices
of
monsieur
de
condamin
and
doctor
porquier
he
said
straining
his
ear
towards
the
are
making
fun
of
the
paloques
did
you
hear
monsieur
delangre
saying
in
his
falsetto
ladies
you
had
better
come
in
the
air
is
growing
cool
do
you
think
that
little
delangre
always
talks
as
though
he
had
swallowed
a
then
he
turned
his
head
towards
the
rastoils
garden
have
anyone
there
he
said
ca
hear
anything
ah
yes
those
big
geese
the
daughters
are
by
the
waterfall
the
elder
one
talks
just
as
though
she
were
gobbling
pebbles
every
evening
they
sit
there
jabbering
for
a
good
hour
they
ca
want
all
that
time
to
tell
each
other
about
the
matrimonial
offers
they
have
had
ah
they
are
all
there
there
abbé
surin
with
a
voice
like
a
flute
and
abbé
fenil
who
would
do
for
a
rattle
on
good
friday
there
are
sometimes
a
score
of
them
huddled
together
without
stirring
a
finger
in
that
garden
i
believe
they
all
go
there
to
listen
to
what
we
say
while
he
went
chattering
on
in
this
manner
abbé
faujas
and
marthe
merely
spoke
a
few
words
chiefly
in
reply
to
his
questions
generally
they
sat
apart
from
him
with
their
faces
raised
to
the
sky
and
their
eyes
gazing
into
space
one
evening
mouret
fell
asleep
then
inclining
their
heads
towards
each
other
they
began
to
talk
in
subdued
tones
while
some
few
yards
away
madame
faujas
with
her
hands
upon
her
knees
her
eyes
wide
open
and
her
ears
on
the
strain
yet
never
seeing
or
hearing
anything
seemed
to
be
keeping
watch
for
them
x
the
summer
passed
away
and
abbé
faujas
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
derive
any
advantage
from
his
increasing
popularity
he
still
kept
himself
in
seclusion
at
the
mourets
delighting
in
the
solitude
of
the
garden
to
which
he
now
came
down
during
the
he
read
his
breviary
as
he
slowly
walked
with
bent
head
up
and
down
the
green
arbour
at
the
far
end
sometimes
he
would
close
his
book
still
further
slacken
his
steps
and
seem
to
be
buried
in
deep
reverie
mouret
who
used
to
watch
him
at
last
became
impatient
and
irritated
at
seeing
that
black
figure
walking
to
and
fro
for
hours
together
behind
his
has
no
privacy
left
he
muttered
ca
lift
my
eyes
now
without
catching
sight
of
that
cassock
he
is
like
a
crow
that
fellow
there
with
his
round
eyes
that
always
seem
to
be
on
the
for
something
i
do
believe
in
his
fine
disinterested
airs
it
was
not
till
early
in
september
that
the
home
of
the
virgin
was
completed
in
the
provinces
workmen
are
painfully
slow
though
it
must
be
stated
that
the
lady
patronesses
had
twice
upset
monsieur
lieutaud
designs
in
favour
of
ideas
of
their
own
when
the
committee
took
possession
of
the
building
they
rewarded
the
architect
for
the
complaisance
he
had
manifested
by
lavishing
the
highest
praises
upon
him
everything
seemed
to
them
perfectly
satisfactory
the
rooms
were
large
the
communications
were
excellent
and
there
was
a
courtyard
planted
with
trees
and
embellished
with
two
small
fountains
madame
de
condamin
was
particularly
charmed
with
the
façade
which
was
one
of
her
own
ideas
over
the
door
the
words
of
the
virgin
were
carved
in
gold
letters
on
a
slab
of
black
marble
on
the
occasion
of
the
opening
of
the
home
there
was
a
very
affecting
ceremony
the
bishop
attended
by
the
chapter
came
in
person
to
install
the
sisters
of
saint
joseph
who
had
been
authorised
to
work
the
institution
a
troop
of
some
fifty
girls
of
from
eight
to
fifteen
years
of
age
had
been
collected
together
from
the
streets
of
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
and
all
that
had
been
required
from
the
parents
to
obtain
admission
for
their
children
had
been
a
declaration
that
their
avocations
necessitated
their
absence
from
home
during
the
entire
day
monsieur
delangre
made
a
speech
which
was
much
applauded
he
explained
at
considerable
length
and
in
a
magnificent
style
the
details
and
arrangements
of
this
new
refuge
which
he
called
school
of
virtue
and
labour
where
young
and
interesting
creatures
would
be
kept
safe
from
wicked
temptations
a
delicate
allusion
towards
the
end
of
the
speech
to
the
real
promoter
of
the
home
abbé
faujas
attracted
much
notice
the
abbé
was
present
amongst
the
other
priests
and
his
fine
grave
face
remained
perfectly
calm
and
tranquil
when
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
marthe
blushed
on
the
platform
where
she
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
lady
patronesses
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
bishop
expressed
a
desire
to
inspect
the
building
in
every
detail
and
notwithstanding
the
evident
annoyance
of
abbé
fenil
he
sent
for
abbé
faujas
whose
big
black
eyes
had
never
for
a
moment
quitted
him
and
requested
him
to
be
good
enough
to
act
as
his
guide
adding
aloud
with
a
smile
that
he
was
sure
he
could
not
find
a
better
one
this
little
speech
was
circulated
amongst
the
departing
spectators
and
in
the
evening
all
plassans
commented
upon
the
bishop
favourable
demeanour
towards
abbé
faujas
the
lady
patronesses
had
reserved
for
themselves
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
home
here
they
provided
a
collation
for
the
bishop
who
ate
a
biscuit
and
drank
two
sips
of
malaga
while
saying
a
polite
word
or
two
to
each
of
them
this
brought
the
pious
festival
to
a
happy
conclusion
for
both
before
and
during
the
ceremony
there
had
been
and
rivalries
among
the
ladies
whom
the
delicate
praises
of
monseigneur
rousselot
quite
restored
to
good
humour
when
they
were
left
to
themselves
they
declared
that
everything
had
gone
off
exceedingly
well
and
they
profusely
praised
the
bishop
madame
paloque
alone
looked
sour
the
prelate
had
somehow
forgotten
her
when
he
was
distributing
his
compliments
were
quite
right
she
said
in
a
fury
to
her
husband
when
she
got
home
again
have
just
been
made
a
convenience
in
that
silly
nonsense
of
theirs
it
a
fine
idea
indeed
to
bring
all
those
corrupt
hussies
together
i
have
given
up
all
my
time
to
them
and
that
big
simpleton
of
a
bishop
who
trembles
before
his
own
clergy
ca
even
say
thank
you
just
as
if
that
madame
de
condamin
had
done
anything
indeed
she
is
far
too
much
occupied
in
showing
off
her
dresses
ah
we
know
quite
enough
about
her
do
we
the
world
will
hear
something
about
her
one
of
these
days
that
will
surprise
it
a
little
thank
goodness
we
nothing
to
conceal
and
that
madame
delangre
and
madame
rastoil
too
well
it
would
be
difficult
to
tell
tales
about
them
that
would
cover
them
with
blushes
and
they
never
stirred
out
of
their
they
have
taken
half
the
trouble
about
the
matter
that
i
have
then
there
that
madame
mouret
with
her
pretence
of
managing
the
whole
business
though
she
really
did
nothing
but
hang
on
to
the
cassock
of
her
abbé
faujas
she
another
hypocrite
of
whom
we
shall
hear
some
pretty
things
one
of
these
days
and
yet
they
could
all
get
a
polite
speech
while
there
was
a
word
for
me
i
nothing
but
a
mere
convenience
they
treat
me
like
a
dog
but
things
go
on
like
this
paloque
i
tell
you
the
dog
will
turn
and
bite
them
before
long
from
that
time
forward
madame
paloque
showed
herself
much
less
accommodating
she
became
very
irregular
in
her
secretarial
work
and
declined
to
perform
any
duties
that
she
did
not
fancy
till
at
last
the
lady
patronesses
began
to
talk
of
employing
a
paid
secretary
marthe
mentioned
these
worries
to
abbé
faujas
and
asked
him
if
he
could
recommend
a
suitable
man
trouble
yourself
to
look
for
anyone
he
said
dare
say
i
can
find
you
a
fit
person
give
me
two
or
three
days
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
frequently
receiving
letters
bearing
the
besançon
postmark
they
were
all
in
the
same
handwriting
a
large
ugly
hand
rose
who
took
them
up
to
him
remarked
that
he
seemed
vexed
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
envelopes
looks
quite
put
out
she
said
may
depend
upon
it
that
no
great
favourite
of
his
who
writes
to
him
so
often
mouret
old
curiosity
was
roused
by
this
correspondence
one
day
he
took
up
one
of
the
letters
himself
with
a
pleasant
smile
telling
the
abbé
as
an
excuse
for
his
own
appearance
that
rose
was
not
in
the
house
the
abbé
probably
saw
through
mouret
cunning
for
he
assumed
an
expression
of
great
pleasure
as
though
he
had
been
impatiently
expecting
the
letter
but
mouret
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
deceived
by
this
piece
of
acting
he
stayed
outside
the
door
on
the
landing
and
glued
his
ear
to
the
your
sister
again
is
it
asked
madame
faujas
in
her
hard
voice
does
she
worry
you
in
that
way
there
was
a
short
silence
after
which
came
a
sound
of
paper
being
roughly
crumpled
and
the
abbé
said
with
evident
displeasure
always
the
same
old
story
she
wants
to
come
to
us
and
bring
her
husband
with
her
so
that
we
may
get
him
a
situation
somewhere
she
seems
to
think
that
we
are
wallowing
in
gold
i
afraid
they
will
be
doing
something
rash
perhaps
taking
us
by
surprise
some
fine
morning
no
we
ca
do
with
them
here
ovide
his
mother
replied
have
never
liked
you
they
have
always
been
jealous
of
you
trouche
is
a
scamp
and
olympe
is
quite
heartless
they
would
want
everything
for
themselves
and
they
would
compromise
you
and
interfere
with
your
work
mouret
was
too
much
excited
by
the
meanness
of
the
act
he
was
committing
to
be
able
to
hear
well
and
besides
he
thought
that
one
of
them
was
coming
to
the
door
so
he
hurried
away
he
took
care
not
to
mention
what
he
had
done
a
few
days
later
abbé
faujas
in
his
presence
while
they
were
all
out
on
the
terrace
gave
marthe
a
definite
reply
respecting
the
secretaryship
at
the
home
think
i
can
recommend
you
a
suitable
person
he
said
in
his
calm
way
is
a
connection
of
my
own
my
who
is
coming
here
from
besançon
in
a
few
days
mouret
became
very
attentive
while
marthe
appeared
delighted
that
is
excellent
she
exclaimed
was
feeling
very
much
bothered
about
finding
a
suitable
person
you
see
with
all
those
young
girls
we
must
have
a
person
of
unexceptionable
morality
but
of
course
a
connection
of
yours
yes
interrupted
the
priest
sister
had
a
little
hosiery
business
at
besançon
which
she
has
been
obliged
to
give
up
on
account
of
her
health
and
now
she
is
anxious
to
join
us
again
as
the
doctors
have
ordered
her
to
live
in
the
south
my
mother
is
very
much
pleased
sure
she
must
be
said
marthe
dare
say
it
grieved
you
very
much
to
have
to
separate
and
you
will
be
very
glad
to
be
together
again
i
tell
you
what
you
must
do
there
are
a
couple
of
rooms
upstairs
that
you
do
use
why
should
your
sister
and
her
husband
have
them
they
have
no
children
have
they
there
are
only
their
two
selves
i
had
indeed
thought
for
a
moment
of
giving
them
those
two
rooms
but
i
was
afraid
of
displeasing
you
by
bringing
other
people
into
your
house
at
all
i
assure
you
you
are
very
quiet
people
she
checked
herself
suddenly
for
her
husband
was
tugging
at
her
dress
he
did
not
want
to
have
the
abbé
relations
in
the
house
for
he
remembered
in
what
terms
madame
faujas
had
spoken
of
her
daughter
and
rooms
are
very
small
he
began
monsieur
would
be
inconvenienced
it
would
be
better
for
all
parties
that
his
sister
should
take
lodgings
somewhere
else
there
happen
to
be
some
rooms
vacant
just
now
at
the
paloques
house
over
the
way
there
was
a
dead
pause
in
the
conversation
the
priest
said
nothing
but
gazed
up
into
the
sky
marthe
thought
he
was
offended
and
she
felt
much
distressed
at
her
husband
bluntness
after
a
moment
she
could
no
longer
endure
the
embarrassing
silence
it
settled
then
she
said
without
any
attempt
at
skill
in
knitting
the
broken
threads
of
the
conversation
together
again
shall
help
your
mother
to
clean
the
rooms
my
husband
was
only
thinking
about
your
own
personal
convenience
but
of
course
if
you
wish
it
it
is
not
for
us
to
prevent
you
from
disposing
of
the
rooms
in
any
way
you
like
mouret
was
quite
angry
when
he
again
found
himself
alone
with
his
wife
ca
understand
you
at
all
he
cried
first
i
let
the
rooms
to
the
abbé
you
were
quite
displeased
and
seemed
to
hate
the
thought
of
having
even
so
much
as
a
cat
brought
into
the
house
and
now
i
believe
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
for
the
abbé
to
bring
the
whole
of
his
relations
down
to
his
third
and
fourth
cousins
did
you
feel
me
tugging
at
your
dress
you
might
have
known
that
i
did
want
those
people
they
are
not
very
respectable
folks
do
you
know
that
cried
marthe
annoyed
by
this
accusation
told
you
so
indeed
it
was
abbé
faujas
himself
i
overheard
him
one
day
while
he
was
talking
to
his
mother
she
looked
at
him
keenly
and
he
blushed
slightly
beneath
her
gaze
as
he
stammered
it
is
sufficient
that
i
do
know
the
sister
is
a
heartless
creature
and
her
husband
is
a
scamp
it
of
no
use
your
putting
on
that
air
of
insulted
majesty
those
were
their
own
words
and
i
inventing
nothing
i
do
want
to
have
those
people
here
do
you
understand
the
old
lady
herself
was
the
first
to
object
to
her
daughter
coming
here
the
abbé
now
seems
to
have
changed
his
mind
i
do
know
what
has
led
him
to
alter
his
opinion
it
some
fresh
mystery
of
his
he
going
to
make
use
of
them
somehow
marthe
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
allowed
her
husband
to
rail
on
he
told
rose
not
to
clean
the
rooms
but
rose
now
only
obeyed
her
mistress
orders
for
five
days
his
anger
vented
itself
in
bitter
words
and
furious
recriminations
in
abbé
faujas
presence
he
confined
himself
to
sulking
for
he
did
not
dare
to
attack
the
priest
openly
then
as
usual
he
ended
by
submitting
and
ceased
to
rail
at
the
people
who
were
coming
but
he
drew
his
still
tighter
isolated
himself
shut
himself
up
more
and
more
in
his
own
selfish
existence
when
the
trouches
arrived
one
october
evening
he
merely
exclaimed
deuce
they
do
look
a
nice
couple
what
faces
they
have
abbé
faujas
did
not
appear
very
desirous
that
his
sister
and
should
be
seen
on
that
occasion
his
mother
took
up
a
position
by
the
and
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
them
turning
out
of
the
place
of
the
she
glanced
uneasily
behind
her
into
the
hall
and
the
kitchen
luck
was
however
against
her
for
just
as
the
trouches
arrived
marthe
who
was
going
out
came
up
from
the
garden
followed
by
her
children
there
you
all
are
she
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
madame
faujas
who
was
generally
so
completely
mistress
of
herself
could
not
suppress
a
slight
show
of
confusion
as
she
stammered
a
word
or
two
of
reply
for
some
moments
they
stood
confronting
and
scrutinising
each
other
in
the
hall
mouret
had
hurriedly
mounted
the
steps
and
rose
had
taken
up
her
position
at
the
kitchen
door
must
be
very
glad
to
be
together
again
said
marthe
addressing
madame
faujas
then
noticing
the
feeling
of
embarrassment
which
was
keeping
them
all
silent
she
turned
towards
trouche
and
added
arrived
by
the
five
train
i
suppose
how
long
were
you
in
getting
here
from
besançon
hours
in
the
train
trouche
replied
opening
a
toothless
mouth
is
no
joke
that
in
a
carriage
i
can
tell
you
one
gets
pretty
well
shaken
up
inside
then
he
laughed
with
a
peculiar
clattering
of
his
jaws
madame
faujas
cast
a
very
angry
glance
at
him
and
he
began
to
fumble
mechanically
at
his
greasy
overcoat
trying
to
fasten
a
button
that
was
no
longer
there
and
pressing
to
his
thighs
doubtless
in
order
to
hide
some
stains
a
couple
of
cardboard
which
he
was
carrying
one
green
and
the
other
yellow
his
red
throat
was
perpetually
gurgling
beneath
a
twisted
ragged
black
neckcloth
over
which
appeared
the
edge
of
a
dirty
shirt
in
his
wrinkled
face
which
seemed
to
reek
with
vice
there
glistened
two
little
black
eyes
that
rolled
about
incessantly
examining
everybody
and
everything
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
covetousness
they
looked
like
the
eyes
of
a
thief
studying
a
house
to
which
he
means
to
return
in
order
to
plunder
it
some
night
mouret
fancied
that
trouche
was
examining
the
fastenings
fellow
he
thought
to
himself
as
though
he
were
getting
the
patterns
of
the
locks
into
his
head
olympe
was
conscious
that
her
husband
had
made
a
vulgar
remark
she
was
a
tall
slight
woman
fair
and
faded
with
a
flat
plain
face
she
carried
a
little
deal
box
and
a
big
bundle
tied
up
in
a
tablecloth
have
brought
some
pillows
with
us
she
said
glancing
at
the
bundle
come
in
very
usefully
in
a
carriage
they
make
one
quite
as
comfortable
as
if
one
were
travelling
it
is
a
great
saving
going
third
and
it
is
of
no
use
throwing
money
away
is
it
not
marthe
replied
somewhat
surprised
by
the
appearance
and
language
of
the
olympe
now
came
forward
and
went
on
talking
in
an
ingratiating
way
the
same
thing
with
clothes
said
she
i
set
off
on
a
journey
i
put
on
my
shabbiest
things
i
told
honoré
that
his
old
overcoat
was
quite
good
enough
and
he
has
got
his
old
trousers
on
too
trousers
that
he
quite
tired
of
wearing
you
see
i
selected
my
worse
dress
it
is
actually
in
holes
i
believe
this
shawl
was
mother
i
used
to
iron
on
it
at
home
and
this
bonnet
i
wearing
is
an
old
one
that
i
only
put
on
when
i
go
to
the
but
quite
good
enough
to
get
spoilt
with
the
dust
is
it
madame
certainly
replied
marthe
trying
to
force
a
smile
just
at
this
moment
a
stern
voice
was
heard
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
calling
sharply
now
mother
mouret
raised
his
head
and
saw
abbé
faujas
leaning
against
the
banisters
looking
very
angry
and
bending
over
at
the
risk
of
falling
to
get
a
better
view
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
passage
he
had
heard
a
sound
of
talking
and
had
been
waiting
there
for
a
moment
or
two
in
great
impatience
mother
come
he
cried
again
yes
we
are
coming
up
answered
madame
faujas
trembling
at
the
sound
of
her
son
angry
voice
then
turning
to
the
trouches
she
said
along
my
children
we
must
go
upstairs
let
us
leave
madame
to
attend
to
her
business
but
the
trouches
did
not
seem
to
hear
they
appeared
quite
satisfied
to
remain
in
the
passage
and
they
looked
about
them
with
a
air
as
though
the
house
had
just
been
presented
to
them
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
is
it
honoré
olympe
said
what
ovide
wrote
in
his
letters
we
scarcely
expected
to
find
it
so
nice
as
this
did
we
but
i
told
you
that
we
ought
to
come
here
and
that
we
should
do
better
here
and
i
am
right
you
see
yes
we
ought
to
be
very
comfortable
here
trouche
murmured
garden
too
seems
a
pretty
big
one
then
addressing
mouret
he
inquired
you
allow
your
lodgers
to
walk
in
the
garden
sir
before
mouret
had
time
to
reply
abbé
faujas
who
had
come
downstairs
cried
out
in
thundering
tones
trouche
come
olympe
they
turned
round
and
when
they
saw
him
standing
on
the
steps
looking
terribly
angry
they
fairly
quailed
and
meekly
followed
him
the
abbé
went
up
the
stairs
in
front
of
them
without
saying
another
word
without
even
seeming
to
observe
the
presence
of
mouret
who
stood
gazing
after
the
singular
procession
madame
faujas
smiled
at
marthe
to
take
away
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
as
she
brought
up
the
rear
marthe
then
went
out
and
mouret
left
to
himself
lingered
a
moment
or
two
in
the
passage
upstairs
on
the
second
floor
doors
were
being
noisily
banged
then
loud
voices
were
heard
and
presently
there
came
dead
silence
he
locked
them
up
separately
i
wonder
said
mouret
to
himself
with
a
laugh
anyhow
they
are
not
a
nice
family
on
the
very
next
day
trouche
respectably
dressed
entirely
in
black
shaven
and
with
his
scanty
hair
carefully
brushed
over
his
temples
was
presented
by
abbé
faujas
to
marthe
and
the
lady
patronesses
he
was
years
of
age
wrote
a
hand
and
was
said
to
have
kept
the
books
of
a
mercantile
house
for
a
long
time
the
ladies
at
once
installed
him
as
secretary
his
duties
were
to
represent
the
committee
and
employ
himself
in
certain
routine
work
from
ten
till
four
in
an
office
on
the
first
floor
of
the
home
his
salary
was
to
be
fifteen
hundred
francs
good
people
are
very
quiet
you
see
marthe
remarked
to
her
husband
a
few
days
afterwards
indeed
the
trouches
made
no
more
noise
than
the
faujases
two
or
three
times
rose
asserted
that
she
had
heard
quarrels
between
the
mother
and
daughter
but
the
abbé
grave
voice
had
immediately
restored
peace
trouche
went
out
every
morning
punctually
at
a
quarter
to
ten
and
came
back
again
at
a
quarter
past
four
he
never
went
out
in
the
evening
olympe
occasionally
went
shopping
with
madame
faujas
but
she
was
never
seen
to
come
down
the
stairs
by
herself
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
trouches
slept
overlooked
the
garden
it
was
the
last
one
on
the
right
in
front
of
the
trees
of
the
big
curtains
of
red
calico
with
a
yellow
border
hung
behind
the
glass
panes
making
a
strong
contrast
when
seen
from
outside
with
the
priest
white
ones
the
window
was
invariably
kept
closed
one
evening
when
abbé
faujas
and
his
mother
were
out
on
the
terrace
with
the
mourets
a
slight
involuntary
cough
was
heard
and
as
the
priest
raised
his
head
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
he
caught
sight
of
olympe
and
her
husband
leaning
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
or
two
he
kept
his
eyes
turned
upwards
thus
interrupting
his
conversation
with
marthe
at
this
the
trouches
disappeared
and
those
below
heard
the
being
fastened
had
better
go
upstairs
i
think
mother
said
the
priest
am
afraid
you
may
be
catching
cold
out
here
madame
faujas
wished
them
all
and
when
she
had
retired
marthe
resumed
the
conversation
by
asking
in
her
kindly
way
your
sister
worse
i
have
not
seen
her
for
a
week
has
great
need
of
rest
the
priest
curtly
answered
however
marthe
sympathetic
interest
made
her
continue
the
subject
shuts
herself
up
too
much
said
she
fresh
air
would
do
her
good
these
october
evenings
are
still
quite
warm
why
does
she
ever
come
out
into
the
garden
she
has
never
set
foot
in
it
you
know
that
it
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
the
priest
muttered
a
few
vague
words
of
excuse
and
then
mouret
to
increase
his
embarrassment
manifested
still
greater
amiability
than
his
wife
just
what
i
was
saying
this
morning
he
began
sister
might
very
well
bring
her
sewing
out
here
in
the
sun
in
the
afternoons
instead
of
keeping
herself
shut
in
upstairs
anyone
would
think
that
she
dare
even
show
herself
at
the
window
she
frightened
of
us
i
hope
we
are
not
such
terrible
people
as
all
that
and
monsieur
trouche
too
he
hurries
up
the
stairs
four
steps
at
a
time
tell
them
to
come
and
spend
an
evening
with
us
now
and
then
they
must
be
frightfully
dull
up
in
that
room
of
theirs
all
alone
the
abbé
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
humour
that
evening
to
submit
to
his
landlord
pleasantry
he
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
and
said
very
bluntly
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
there
is
little
probability
of
their
accepting
your
invitation
they
are
tired
in
the
evening
and
they
go
to
bed
and
besides
that
is
the
best
thing
they
can
do
as
they
like
my
dear
sir
replied
mouret
vexed
by
the
rough
manner
when
he
was
alone
again
with
marthe
he
said
to
her
the
abbé
i
wonder
think
he
can
persuade
us
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
it
quite
clear
that
he
is
afraid
that
those
scamps
he
has
taken
in
will
play
him
some
bad
trick
or
other
did
you
see
how
sharply
he
kept
his
eye
on
them
this
evening
when
he
caught
sight
of
them
at
the
window
they
were
spying
out
at
us
up
there
there
will
be
a
bad
end
to
all
this
marthe
was
now
living
in
a
state
of
blessed
calm
she
no
longer
felt
troubled
by
mouret
raillery
the
gradual
growth
of
faith
within
her
filled
her
with
exquisite
joy
she
glided
softly
and
slowly
into
a
life
of
pious
devotion
which
seemed
to
lull
her
with
a
sweet
restfulness
abbé
faujas
still
avoided
speaking
to
her
of
god
he
remained
merely
a
friend
simply
exercising
influence
over
her
by
his
grave
demeanour
and
the
vague
odour
of
incense
exhaled
by
his
cassock
on
two
or
three
occasions
when
she
was
alone
with
him
she
had
again
broken
out
into
fits
of
nervous
sobbing
without
knowing
why
but
finding
a
happiness
in
thus
allowing
herself
to
weep
on
each
of
these
occasions
the
abbé
had
merely
taken
her
hands
in
silence
calming
her
with
his
serene
and
authoritative
gaze
when
she
wanted
to
tell
him
of
her
strange
attacks
of
sadness
or
her
secret
joys
or
her
need
of
guidance
he
smiled
and
hushed
her
telling
her
that
these
matters
were
not
his
concern
and
that
she
must
speak
of
them
to
abbé
bourrette
then
she
retired
completely
within
herself
and
remained
trembling
while
the
priest
seemed
to
assume
still
colder
reserve
than
before
and
strode
away
from
her
like
some
unheeding
god
at
whose
feet
she
wished
to
pour
out
her
soul
in
humiliation
marthe
chief
occupation
now
was
attending
the
various
religious
services
and
works
in
which
she
took
part
in
the
vast
nave
of
she
felt
perfectly
happy
it
was
there
that
she
experienced
the
full
sweetness
of
that
purely
physical
restfulness
which
she
sought
she
there
forgot
everything
it
was
like
an
immense
window
open
upon
another
life
a
life
that
was
wide
and
infinite
and
full
of
an
emotion
which
thrilled
and
satisfied
her
but
she
still
felt
some
fear
of
the
church
and
she
went
there
with
a
feeling
of
uneasy
bashfulness
and
a
touch
of
nervous
shame
that
made
her
glance
behind
her
as
she
passed
through
the
doorway
to
see
if
anyone
was
watching
her
then
once
inside
she
abandoned
herself
everything
around
her
seemed
to
assume
a
melting
softness
even
the
unctuous
voice
of
abbé
bourrette
who
after
he
had
confessed
her
sometimes
kept
her
on
her
knees
for
a
few
minutes
longer
while
he
spoke
to
her
about
madame
rastoil
dinners
or
the
rougons
last
reception
marthe
often
returned
home
in
a
condition
of
complete
prostration
religion
seemed
to
break
her
down
rose
had
become
in
the
house
she
scolded
mouret
found
fault
with
him
because
he
dirtied
too
much
linen
and
let
him
have
his
dinner
at
her
own
hours
she
even
tried
to
convert
him
does
quite
right
to
live
a
christian
life
said
she
will
be
damned
sir
you
will
and
it
will
only
be
right
for
you
are
not
a
good
man
at
heart
no
you
are
not
you
ought
to
go
with
your
wife
to
mass
next
sunday
morning
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
let
things
take
their
own
course
and
sometimes
even
did
a
bit
of
himself
taking
a
turn
or
two
with
the
broom
when
he
thought
that
the
looked
particularly
dusty
the
children
gave
him
most
trouble
it
was
and
as
their
mother
was
scarcely
ever
at
home
désirée
and
octave
who
had
again
failed
in
his
examination
for
his
degree
turned
the
place
upside
down
serge
was
poorly
kept
his
bed
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
in
his
room
he
had
become
abbé
faujas
favourite
and
the
priest
lent
him
books
mouret
thus
spent
two
dreadful
months
at
his
wits
end
how
to
manage
his
young
folks
octave
was
a
special
trouble
to
him
and
as
he
did
not
feel
inclined
to
keep
him
at
home
till
the
end
of
the
vacation
he
determined
that
he
should
not
again
return
to
college
but
should
be
sent
to
some
at
marseilles
you
wo
look
after
them
at
all
he
said
to
marthe
must
find
some
place
or
other
to
put
them
in
i
am
quite
worn
out
with
them
all
and
i
wo
have
them
at
home
any
longer
it
your
own
fault
if
it
causes
you
any
grief
octave
is
quite
unbearable
he
will
never
pass
his
examination
and
it
will
be
much
better
to
teach
him
at
once
how
to
gain
his
own
living
instead
of
letting
him
idle
his
time
away
with
a
lot
of
one
meets
him
roaming
all
over
the
town
marthe
was
very
much
distressed
she
seemed
to
awake
from
a
dream
on
hearing
that
one
of
her
children
was
about
to
leave
her
she
succeeded
in
getting
the
departure
postponed
for
a
week
during
which
she
remained
more
at
home
and
resumed
her
active
life
but
she
quickly
dropped
back
again
into
her
previous
state
of
listless
languor
and
on
the
day
that
octave
came
to
kiss
her
telling
her
that
he
was
to
leave
for
marseilles
in
the
evening
she
had
lost
all
strength
and
energy
and
contented
herself
with
giving
him
some
good
advice
mouret
came
back
from
the
railway
station
with
a
very
heavy
heart
he
looked
about
him
for
his
wife
and
found
her
in
the
garden
crying
under
the
arbour
then
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
that
one
the
less
he
exclaimed
ought
to
feel
glad
of
it
you
will
be
able
to
go
prowling
about
the
church
now
as
much
as
you
like
make
your
mind
easy
the
other
two
wo
be
here
long
i
shall
keep
serge
with
me
as
he
is
a
very
quiet
lad
and
is
rather
young
as
yet
to
go
and
read
for
the
bar
but
if
he
at
all
in
your
way
just
let
me
know
and
i
will
free
you
of
him
at
once
as
for
désirée
i
shall
send
her
to
her
nurse
marthe
went
on
weeping
in
silence
what
would
you
have
he
continued
ca
be
both
in
and
out
since
you
have
taken
to
keeping
away
from
home
your
children
have
become
indifferent
to
you
that
logic
is
it
besides
it
is
necessary
to
find
room
for
all
the
people
who
are
now
living
in
our
house
it
is
nearly
big
enough
and
we
shall
be
lucky
if
we
get
turned
out
of
doors
ourselves
he
had
raised
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
and
was
looking
at
the
windows
of
the
then
lowering
his
voice
he
added
go
on
crying
in
that
ridiculous
way
they
are
watching
you
do
you
see
those
eyes
peeping
between
the
red
curtains
they
are
the
eyes
of
the
abbé
sister
i
know
them
well
enough
you
may
depend
on
seeing
them
there
all
day
long
the
abbé
himself
may
be
a
decent
fellow
but
as
for
those
trouches
i
know
they
are
always
crouching
behind
their
curtains
like
wolves
waiting
to
spring
on
one
i
feel
quite
certain
that
if
the
abbé
did
prevent
them
they
would
come
down
in
the
night
to
steal
my
pears
dry
your
tears
my
dear
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
they
are
enjoying
our
disagreement
even
though
they
have
been
the
cause
of
the
boy
going
away
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
let
them
see
what
a
trouble
his
departure
has
been
to
us
both
his
voice
broke
and
he
himself
seemed
on
the
point
of
sobbing
marthe
quite
deeply
touched
by
his
last
words
was
prompted
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
but
they
were
afraid
of
being
observed
and
besides
they
felt
as
if
there
were
some
obstacle
between
them
that
prevented
them
from
coming
together
so
they
separated
while
eyes
still
glistened
between
the
red
curtains
upstairs
xi
one
morning
abbé
bourrette
made
his
appearance
his
face
betokening
the
greatest
distress
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
marthe
on
the
steps
he
hurried
up
to
her
and
seizing
her
hands
and
pressing
them
he
stammered
compan
it
is
all
over
with
him
he
is
dying
i
am
going
upstairs
i
must
see
faujas
at
once
when
marthe
showed
him
his
fellow
priest
who
according
to
his
wont
was
walking
to
and
fro
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
reading
his
breviary
he
ran
up
to
him
tottering
on
his
short
legs
he
tried
to
speak
and
tell
the
other
the
sad
news
but
his
grief
choked
him
and
he
could
only
throw
his
arms
round
abbé
faujas
neck
while
sobbing
bitterly
what
the
matter
with
the
two
parsons
cried
mouret
who
had
hastily
rushed
out
of
the
curé
of
is
dying
marthe
replied
showing
much
distress
mouret
assumed
an
expression
of
surprise
and
as
he
went
back
into
the
house
he
murmured
that
worthy
bourrette
will
manage
to
console
himself
when
he
is
appointed
curé
in
the
other
place
he
counts
on
getting
the
post
he
told
me
so
abbé
faujas
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
priest
embrace
quietly
closed
his
breviary
and
listened
to
the
sad
news
with
a
grave
face
wants
to
see
you
said
abbé
bourrette
in
a
broken
voice
will
not
last
the
morning
out
oh
he
has
been
a
dear
friend
to
me
we
studied
together
he
is
anxious
to
say
to
you
he
has
been
telling
me
all
through
the
night
that
you
were
the
only
man
of
courage
in
the
diocese
for
more
than
a
year
now
he
has
been
getting
weaker
and
weaker
and
not
a
single
plassans
priest
has
dared
to
go
and
grasp
his
hand
while
you
a
stranger
who
scarcely
knew
him
you
have
spent
an
afternoon
with
him
every
week
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
just
now
as
he
was
speaking
of
you
you
must
lose
no
time
my
friend
abbé
faujas
went
up
to
his
room
for
a
moment
while
abbé
bourrette
paced
impatiently
and
hopelessly
about
the
passage
and
then
at
last
they
set
off
together
the
old
priest
wiped
his
brow
and
swayed
about
on
the
road
as
he
talked
in
disconnected
fashion
would
have
died
like
a
dog
without
a
single
prayer
being
said
for
him
if
his
sister
had
not
come
and
told
me
about
him
at
eleven
last
night
she
did
quite
right
the
dear
lady
though
he
did
not
want
to
compromise
any
of
us
and
even
would
have
foregone
the
last
sacraments
yes
my
friend
he
was
dying
all
alone
abandoned
and
deserted
he
who
had
so
high
a
mind
and
who
has
only
lived
to
do
good
then
bourrette
became
silent
but
after
a
few
moments
he
resumed
again
in
a
different
voice
you
think
that
fenil
will
ever
forgive
me
for
this
never
i
expect
when
compan
saw
me
bringing
the
viaticum
he
was
unwilling
to
let
me
anoint
him
and
told
me
to
go
away
well
well
it
all
over
with
me
now
and
i
shall
never
be
curé
but
i
am
glad
that
i
did
it
and
that
i
have
let
compan
die
like
a
dog
he
has
been
at
war
with
fenil
for
thirty
years
you
know
when
he
took
to
his
bed
he
said
to
me
ah
it
fenil
who
is
going
to
carry
the
day
now
that
i
am
stricken
down
he
will
get
the
better
of
me
so
think
of
it
that
poor
compan
whom
i
have
seen
so
and
energetic
at
little
eusèbe
the
whom
i
took
to
ring
the
viaticum
bell
was
quite
embarrassed
when
he
found
where
we
were
going
he
kept
looking
behind
him
at
each
tinkle
as
if
he
was
afraid
that
fenil
would
hear
it
abbé
faujas
who
was
stepping
along
quickly
with
bent
head
and
a
preoccupied
air
kept
perfectly
silent
and
did
not
even
seem
to
hear
what
his
companion
was
saying
the
bishop
been
informed
he
suddenly
asked
but
abbé
bourrette
in
his
turn
now
appeared
to
be
buried
in
thought
and
made
no
reply
however
just
as
they
reached
abbé
compan
door
he
said
to
his
companion
him
that
we
met
fenil
and
that
he
bowed
to
us
it
will
please
him
for
he
will
then
think
that
i
shall
be
appointed
curé
they
went
up
the
stairs
in
silence
the
curé
sister
came
to
the
landing
and
on
seeing
them
burst
into
tears
then
she
stammered
between
her
sobs
is
all
over
he
has
just
passed
away
in
my
arms
i
was
quite
alone
with
him
as
he
was
dying
he
looked
round
him
and
murmured
i
must
have
the
plague
since
they
have
all
deserted
me
ah
gentlemen
he
died
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
they
went
into
the
little
room
where
abbé
compan
with
his
head
resting
on
his
pillow
seemed
to
be
asleep
his
eyes
had
remained
open
and
tears
yet
trickled
down
his
white
sad
face
then
abbé
bourrette
fell
upon
his
knees
sobbing
and
praying
with
his
face
pressed
to
the
counterpane
abbé
faujas
at
first
remained
standing
gazing
at
the
dead
man
and
after
having
knelt
for
a
moment
he
quietly
went
away
abbé
bourrette
was
so
absorbed
in
his
grief
that
he
did
not
even
hear
his
colleague
close
the
door
abbé
faujas
went
straight
to
the
bishop
in
monseigneur
he
met
abbé
surin
carrying
a
bundle
of
papers
you
want
to
speak
to
his
lordship
asked
the
secretary
with
his
smile
have
come
at
an
unfortunate
time
his
lordship
is
so
busy
that
he
has
given
orders
that
no
one
is
to
be
admitted
i
want
to
see
him
on
a
very
urgent
matter
quietly
said
abbé
faujas
can
at
any
rate
let
him
know
that
i
am
here
and
i
will
wait
if
it
is
necessary
am
afraid
that
it
would
be
useless
for
you
to
wait
his
lordship
has
several
people
with
him
it
would
be
better
if
you
came
again
but
the
abbé
took
a
chair
and
just
as
he
was
doing
so
the
bishop
opened
the
door
of
his
study
he
appeared
much
vexed
on
seeing
his
visitor
whom
at
first
he
pretended
not
to
recognise
son
he
said
to
surin
you
have
arranged
those
papers
come
to
me
immediately
there
is
a
letter
i
want
to
dictate
to
you
then
turning
to
the
priest
who
remained
respectfully
standing
he
said
is
it
you
monsieur
faujas
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
perhaps
you
want
to
say
something
to
me
come
into
my
study
you
are
never
in
the
way
monseigneur
rousselot
study
was
a
very
large
and
rather
gloomy
room
in
which
a
great
wood
fire
was
kept
burning
in
the
summer
as
well
as
the
winter
the
heavy
carpet
and
curtains
kept
out
all
the
air
and
the
room
was
like
a
warm
bath
the
bishop
like
some
dowager
shutting
herself
up
from
the
world
detesting
all
noise
and
excitement
lived
a
chilly
life
there
in
his
armchair
committing
to
abbé
fenil
the
care
of
his
diocese
he
delighted
in
the
classics
and
it
was
said
that
he
was
secretly
making
a
translation
of
horace
he
was
equally
fond
of
the
little
verses
of
the
anthology
and
broad
quotations
occasionally
escaped
from
his
lips
quotations
which
he
enjoyed
with
the
naïveté
of
a
learned
man
who
cares
nothing
for
the
modesty
of
the
vulgar
is
no
one
here
you
see
said
he
sitting
down
before
the
fire
i
do
feel
very
well
and
i
gave
orders
that
nobody
was
to
be
admitted
now
you
can
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
i
am
quite
at
your
service
his
general
expression
of
amiability
was
tinged
with
a
kind
of
vague
uneasiness
a
sort
of
resigned
submission
when
abbé
faujas
had
informed
him
of
the
death
of
abbé
compan
he
rose
from
his
chair
apparently
both
distressed
and
alarmed
he
cried
good
compan
dead
and
i
was
not
able
to
bid
him
farewell
no
one
gave
me
any
warning
ah
my
friend
you
were
right
when
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
was
no
longer
master
here
they
abuse
my
kindness
lordship
knows
said
abbé
faujas
devoted
i
am
to
you
i
am
only
waiting
for
a
sign
from
you
the
bishop
shook
his
head
as
he
murmured
yes
i
remember
the
offer
you
made
to
me
you
have
an
excellent
heart
but
what
an
uproar
there
would
be
if
i
were
to
break
with
abbé
fenil
i
should
have
my
ears
deafened
for
a
whole
week
and
yet
if
i
could
feel
quite
sure
that
you
could
really
rid
me
of
him
if
i
was
not
afraid
that
at
a
week
end
he
would
come
back
and
crush
your
neck
under
his
heel
abbé
faujas
could
not
repress
a
smile
tears
were
welling
from
the
bishop
eyes
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
the
prelate
resumed
as
he
again
sank
down
into
his
chair
do
feel
equal
to
it
yet
it
is
that
miserable
man
who
has
killed
compan
and
has
kept
his
death
agony
a
secret
from
me
so
that
i
might
not
go
and
close
his
eyes
he
is
capable
of
the
most
terrible
things
but
you
see
i
like
to
live
in
peace
fenil
is
very
energetic
and
he
renders
me
great
services
in
the
diocese
when
i
am
no
longer
here
matters
will
perhaps
be
better
ordered
he
grew
calmer
again
and
his
smile
returned
everything
is
going
on
satisfactorily
at
present
and
i
see
any
immediate
difficulty
we
can
wait
abbé
faujas
sat
down
and
calmly
resumed
doubt
but
still
you
will
have
to
appoint
a
curé
for
in
succession
to
the
abbé
compan
monseigneur
rousselot
lifted
his
hands
to
his
temples
with
an
expression
of
hopelessness
you
are
right
he
ejaculated
had
forgotten
that
poor
compan
does
know
in
what
a
hole
he
has
put
me
by
dying
so
suddenly
without
my
having
had
any
warning
i
promised
you
that
place
did
i
the
abbé
bowed
my
friend
you
will
save
me
by
letting
me
take
back
my
word
you
know
how
fenil
detests
you
the
success
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
has
made
him
quite
furious
and
he
swears
that
he
will
prevent
you
from
making
the
conquest
of
plassans
i
am
talking
to
you
quite
openly
you
see
recently
when
reference
was
made
to
the
appointment
of
a
curé
for
i
let
your
name
fall
but
fenil
flew
into
a
frightful
rage
and
i
was
obliged
to
promise
that
i
would
give
the
place
to
a
friend
of
his
abbé
chardon
whom
you
know
and
who
is
really
a
very
worthy
man
now
my
friend
do
this
much
for
me
and
give
up
that
idea
i
will
make
you
whatever
recompense
you
like
to
name
the
priest
face
wore
a
grave
expression
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
taking
counsel
of
himself
he
spoke
know
very
well
my
lord
he
said
i
am
quite
without
personal
ambition
i
should
much
prefer
to
lead
a
life
of
privacy
and
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
give
up
this
appointment
but
i
am
not
my
own
master
i
feel
bound
to
satisfy
those
patrons
of
mine
who
take
an
interest
in
me
i
trust
that
your
lordship
will
reflect
very
seriously
before
taking
a
step
which
you
would
probably
regret
afterwards
although
abbé
faujas
spoke
very
humbly
the
bishop
was
not
unconscious
of
the
menace
which
his
words
veiled
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
took
a
few
steps
about
the
room
a
prey
to
the
painful
perplexity
well
he
said
lifting
his
hands
trouble
and
no
mistake
for
a
long
time
i
should
much
have
preferred
to
avoid
all
these
explanations
but
since
you
insist
i
must
speak
frankly
well
my
dear
sir
abbé
fenil
brings
many
charges
against
you
as
i
think
i
told
you
before
he
must
have
written
to
besançon
and
learnt
all
the
vexatious
stories
you
know
of
you
have
certainly
explained
those
matters
to
me
and
i
am
quite
aware
of
your
merits
and
of
your
life
of
penitence
and
solitude
but
what
can
i
do
fenil
has
weapons
against
you
and
he
uses
them
ruthlessly
i
often
do
know
what
to
say
in
your
defence
when
the
minister
requested
me
to
receive
you
into
my
diocese
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
that
your
position
would
be
a
difficult
one
but
he
continued
to
press
me
and
said
that
that
was
your
affair
and
so
in
the
end
i
consented
but
you
must
not
come
and
ask
me
to
do
what
is
impossible
abbé
faujas
had
not
lowered
his
head
during
the
bishop
remarks
he
now
raised
it
still
higher
as
he
looked
the
prelate
straight
in
the
face
and
said
in
his
sharp
voice
have
given
me
your
promise
my
lord
certainly
the
bishop
replied
poor
compan
was
getting
weaker
every
day
and
you
came
and
confided
certain
matters
to
me
and
i
then
made
the
promise
to
you
i
do
deny
it
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
everything
so
that
you
may
not
accuse
me
of
wheeling
round
like
a
weathercock
you
asserted
that
the
minister
was
extremely
desirous
for
you
to
be
appointed
curé
of
well
i
wrote
for
information
on
the
subject
and
a
friend
of
mine
went
to
the
ministry
in
paris
they
almost
laughed
in
his
face
there
and
they
told
him
that
they
did
even
know
you
the
minister
absolutely
denies
that
he
is
your
supporter
do
you
hear
if
you
wish
it
i
will
read
you
a
letter
in
which
he
makes
some
very
stern
remarks
about
you
he
stretched
his
arm
towards
a
drawer
but
abbé
faujas
rose
to
his
feet
without
taking
his
eyes
off
him
and
smiled
with
mingled
irony
and
pity
my
lord
my
lord
said
he
then
after
a
moment
silence
as
though
he
were
unwilling
to
enter
into
further
explanations
he
said
give
your
lordship
back
your
promise
but
believe
that
in
all
this
i
was
working
more
for
your
own
advantage
than
for
mine
when
it
will
be
too
late
you
will
call
my
warnings
to
mind
he
stepped
towards
the
door
but
the
bishop
laid
his
hand
upon
him
and
brought
him
back
saying
with
an
expression
of
uneasiness
do
you
mean
explain
yourself
my
dear
monsieur
faujas
i
know
very
well
that
i
have
not
been
in
favour
at
paris
since
the
election
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
but
people
know
me
very
little
if
they
suppose
that
i
had
any
hand
in
the
matter
i
do
go
out
of
my
study
twice
a
month
do
you
imagine
that
they
accuse
me
of
having
brought
about
the
marquis
return
i
am
afraid
so
the
priest
curtly
replied
it
is
quite
absurd
i
have
never
interfered
in
politics
i
live
amongst
my
beloved
books
it
was
fenil
who
did
it
all
i
told
him
a
score
of
times
that
he
would
end
by
compromising
me
in
paris
he
checked
himself
and
blushed
slightly
at
having
allowed
these
last
words
to
escape
him
abbé
faujas
sat
down
again
and
said
in
a
deep
voice
lord
by
those
words
you
have
condemned
your
i
have
never
said
otherwise
than
you
have
just
said
do
not
continue
to
make
common
cause
with
him
or
he
will
lead
you
into
serious
trouble
i
have
friends
in
paris
whatever
you
may
believe
i
know
that
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
election
has
strongly
predisposed
the
government
against
you
rightly
or
wrongly
they
believe
that
you
are
the
sole
cause
of
the
opposition
movement
which
has
manifested
itself
in
plassans
where
the
minister
for
special
reasons
is
most
anxious
to
have
a
majority
if
the
legitimist
candidate
should
again
succeed
at
the
next
election
it
would
be
very
awkward
and
i
should
be
considerably
alarmed
for
your
comfort
this
is
abominable
cried
the
unhappy
bishop
rocking
himself
in
his
chair
ca
prevent
the
legitimist
candidate
from
being
returned
i
have
got
the
least
influence
and
i
never
mix
myself
up
in
these
matters
at
all
really
there
are
times
when
i
feel
that
i
should
like
to
shut
myself
up
in
a
monastery
i
could
take
my
books
with
me
and
lead
a
quiet
peaceful
life
there
it
is
fenil
who
ought
to
be
bishop
instead
of
me
if
i
were
to
listen
to
fenil
i
should
get
on
the
very
worst
terms
with
the
government
i
should
hearken
only
to
rome
and
tell
paris
to
mind
its
own
business
but
that
is
not
my
nature
and
i
want
to
die
in
peace
the
minister
then
you
say
is
enraged
with
me
the
priest
made
no
reply
two
creases
which
appeared
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
gave
his
face
an
expression
of
silent
scorn
continued
the
bishop
i
thought
it
would
please
him
if
i
were
to
appoint
you
curé
of
i
would
try
to
manage
it
but
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
you
are
but
little
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
abbé
faujas
made
a
hasty
movement
of
his
hands
as
he
broke
out
impatiently
you
forgotten
that
calumnies
are
circulated
about
me
and
that
i
came
to
plassans
in
a
threadbare
cassock
when
they
send
a
compromised
man
to
a
post
of
danger
they
deny
all
knowledge
of
him
till
the
day
of
triumph
help
me
to
succeed
my
lord
and
then
you
will
see
that
i
have
friends
in
paris
then
as
the
bishop
surprised
to
find
in
a
priest
such
a
bold
adventurer
continued
to
gaze
at
him
in
silence
faujas
lapsed
into
a
less
assertive
manner
and
continued
however
are
suppositions
and
what
i
mean
is
that
i
have
much
to
be
pardoned
my
friends
are
waiting
to
thank
you
till
my
position
is
completely
established
monseigneur
rousselot
kept
silence
for
a
moment
longer
he
was
a
man
of
sharp
understanding
and
he
had
gained
a
knowledge
of
human
failings
from
books
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
yielding
character
and
he
was
even
a
little
ashamed
of
it
but
he
consoled
himself
for
it
by
judging
men
for
what
they
were
worth
in
the
life
of
a
learned
epicurean
which
he
led
there
were
times
when
he
felt
supreme
disdain
for
the
ambitious
men
about
him
who
fought
amongst
themselves
for
a
few
stray
shreds
of
his
power
he
said
with
a
smile
are
a
pertinacious
man
my
dear
monsieur
faujas
and
since
i
have
made
you
a
promise
i
will
keep
it
six
months
ago
i
confess
i
should
have
been
afraid
of
stirring
up
all
plassans
against
me
but
you
have
succeeded
in
making
yourself
liked
and
the
ladies
of
the
town
often
speak
to
me
about
you
in
very
eulogistic
terms
in
appointing
you
curé
of
i
am
only
paying
the
debt
which
we
owe
you
for
the
home
of
the
virgin
the
bishop
had
recovered
his
usual
pleasant
amiability
and
charming
manner
just
at
this
moment
abbé
surin
put
his
handsome
head
through
the
doorway
my
child
said
the
bishop
to
him
shall
not
dictate
that
letter
to
you
i
have
no
further
need
of
you
and
you
can
go
fenil
is
here
muttered
the
young
priest
very
well
let
him
wait
monseigneur
rousselot
winced
slightly
but
he
spoke
to
his
secretary
with
an
almost
ludicrous
expression
of
decision
and
looked
at
abbé
faujas
with
a
glance
of
intelligence
go
out
this
way
he
said
to
him
as
he
opened
a
door
that
was
hidden
behind
a
curtain
he
kept
the
priest
standing
on
the
threshold
for
a
moment
and
continued
to
look
at
him
with
a
smile
on
his
face
will
be
furious
said
he
you
will
promise
to
defend
me
against
him
if
he
is
too
hard
upon
me
i
am
making
him
your
enemy
i
warn
you
of
that
i
am
counting
upon
you
too
to
prevent
the
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
ah
it
is
upon
you
that
i
am
leaning
now
my
dear
monsieur
faujas
he
waved
his
white
hand
to
the
abbé
and
then
returned
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
unconcern
to
the
warmth
of
his
study
the
priest
had
remained
bowing
feeling
surprised
at
the
quite
feminine
ease
with
which
the
bishop
changed
his
master
and
yielded
to
the
stronger
side
and
only
now
did
he
begin
to
feel
that
monseigneur
rousselot
had
been
secretly
laughing
at
him
even
as
he
laughed
at
abbé
fenil
in
that
downy
armchair
of
his
where
he
read
his
horace
about
ten
on
the
following
thursday
just
when
the
fashionable
folks
of
plassans
were
treading
on
each
other
toes
in
the
green
abbé
faujas
appeared
at
the
door
he
looked
tall
and
majestic
there
was
a
bright
colour
on
his
cheeks
and
he
wore
a
delicate
cassock
that
glistened
like
satin
his
face
was
still
grave
though
there
was
a
slight
smile
upon
it
just
the
pleasant
turn
of
the
lips
that
was
necessary
to
light
up
his
stern
countenance
with
a
ray
of
cheerfulness
here
is
the
dear
curé
madame
de
condamin
gaily
exclaimed
the
mistress
of
the
house
eagerly
hastened
up
to
him
she
grasped
one
of
his
hands
within
both
her
own
and
drew
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
wheedling
glances
and
a
gentle
swaying
of
her
head
is
a
surprise
a
very
pleasant
surprise
she
cried
an
age
since
we
have
seen
you
is
it
only
when
good
fortune
visits
you
that
you
can
remember
your
friends
abbé
faujas
bowed
with
easy
composure
all
around
him
there
was
a
flattering
ovation
a
buzzing
of
enthusiastic
women
madame
delangre
and
madame
rastoil
did
not
wait
till
he
came
up
to
them
but
hastened
to
congratulate
him
upon
his
appointment
which
had
been
officially
announced
that
morning
the
mayor
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
even
monsieur
de
bourdeu
all
stepped
up
to
him
and
shook
his
hand
heartily
he
a
fine
fellow
and
will
go
a
long
way
monsieur
de
condamin
murmured
into
doctor
porquier
ear
scented
him
from
the
first
day
i
saw
him
that
grimacing
old
madame
rougon
and
he
tell
no
end
of
lies
i
have
seen
him
slipping
in
here
at
dusk
half
a
score
of
times
they
must
be
mixed
up
in
some
queer
things
together
doctor
porquier
was
terribly
afraid
of
being
compromised
by
monsieur
de
condamin
so
he
hurried
away
from
him
and
came
like
the
others
to
grasp
abbé
faujas
hand
although
he
had
never
previously
spoken
to
him
the
priest
triumphal
entry
was
the
great
event
of
the
evening
he
had
now
seated
himself
and
was
hemmed
in
by
a
triple
circle
of
petticoats
he
talked
with
charming
good
nature
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
but
avoided
replying
to
any
hints
or
allusions
when
félicité
directly
questioned
him
he
merely
said
that
he
should
not
occupy
the
parsonage
as
he
preferred
remaining
in
the
lodgings
where
he
had
found
himself
so
comfortable
for
nearly
three
years
marthe
was
present
among
the
other
ladies
and
was
as
usual
extremely
reserved
she
had
only
just
smiled
at
the
abbé
watching
him
from
a
distance
and
looking
the
while
a
little
pale
and
rather
weary
and
uneasy
when
he
signified
his
intention
of
not
quitting
the
rue
balande
she
blushed
and
rose
to
go
into
the
small
as
if
she
felt
incommoded
by
the
heat
madame
paloque
beside
whom
monsieur
de
condamin
had
seated
himself
said
to
him
quite
loud
enough
to
be
heard
very
decorous
is
it
she
certainly
might
refrain
from
making
assignations
with
him
here
since
they
have
the
whole
day
to
themselves
only
monsieur
de
condamin
laughed
everyone
else
received
the
sally
very
coldly
then
madame
paloque
recognising
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
tried
to
turn
the
matter
off
as
a
joke
meantime
in
the
corners
of
the
room
the
guests
were
discussing
abbé
fenil
great
curiosity
was
manifested
as
to
whether
he
would
put
in
an
appearance
monsieur
de
bourdeu
who
was
one
of
his
friends
said
with
an
air
of
authority
that
he
was
indisposed
a
statement
which
was
received
by
the
company
with
discreet
smiles
everyone
was
quite
aware
of
the
revolution
that
had
taken
place
at
the
bishop
abbé
surin
gave
the
ladies
some
very
interesting
details
of
the
terrible
scene
that
had
taken
place
between
his
lordship
and
the
the
latter
on
getting
the
worst
of
the
struggle
had
caused
it
to
be
reported
that
he
was
confined
to
his
room
by
an
attack
of
gout
but
the
fight
was
not
over
and
abbé
surin
hinted
that
a
good
deal
more
would
happen
yet
a
remark
which
was
whispered
about
the
room
with
many
little
exclamations
shakings
of
heads
and
expressions
of
surprise
and
doubt
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
abbé
faujas
was
carrying
everything
before
him
and
so
the
fair
devotees
sunned
themselves
pleasantly
in
the
rays
of
the
rising
luminary
about
the
middle
of
the
evening
abbé
bourrette
arrived
conversation
ceased
and
people
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
they
all
knew
that
he
had
expected
to
be
appointed
curé
of
himself
he
had
taken
over
the
abbé
compan
duties
during
the
latter
long
illness
and
he
had
a
lien
upon
the
appointment
he
lingered
for
a
moment
by
the
door
a
little
out
of
breath
and
with
blinking
eyes
without
being
aware
of
the
interest
which
his
appearance
excited
then
catching
sight
of
abbé
faujas
he
eagerly
hastened
up
to
him
and
seizing
both
his
hands
with
a
show
of
much
pleasure
exclaimed
my
dear
friend
let
me
congratulate
you
i
have
just
come
from
your
rooms
where
your
mother
told
me
that
you
were
here
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
abbé
faujas
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
notwithstanding
his
great
he
seemed
annoyed
taken
by
surprise
as
it
were
by
this
unexpected
display
of
affection
he
murmured
felt
bound
to
accept
his
lordship
offer
in
spite
of
my
lack
of
merit
i
refused
it
indeed
at
first
mentioning
the
names
of
several
more
deserving
priests
than
myself
i
mentioned
your
own
name
abbé
bourrette
blinked
and
taking
abbé
faujas
aside
he
said
to
him
in
low
tones
lordship
has
told
me
all
about
it
fenil
it
seems
would
not
hear
of
me
he
would
have
set
the
whole
diocese
in
a
blaze
if
i
had
been
appointed
those
were
his
very
words
my
crime
is
having
closed
poor
compan
eyes
he
demanded
as
you
know
the
appointment
of
abbé
chardon
a
pious
man
no
doubt
but
not
of
sufficient
reputation
fenil
counted
on
reigning
at
in
his
name
it
was
then
that
his
lordship
determined
to
give
you
the
place
and
checkmate
him
i
am
quite
avenged
and
i
am
delighted
my
dear
friend
did
you
know
the
full
story
not
in
all
its
details
it
is
all
just
as
i
have
told
you
i
can
assure
you
i
have
the
facts
from
his
lordship
own
lips
between
ourselves
he
has
hinted
to
me
of
a
very
sufficient
recompense
the
deputy
abbé
vial
has
for
a
long
time
been
desirous
of
settling
in
rome
and
his
place
will
be
vacant
you
understand
but
do
say
anything
about
this
i
would
take
a
big
sum
of
money
for
my
day
work
he
continued
pressing
both
abbé
faujas
hands
while
his
broad
face
beamed
with
satisfaction
the
ladies
around
them
were
smiling
and
looking
at
them
in
surprise
but
the
worthy
man
joy
was
so
frank
and
unreserved
that
it
communicated
itself
to
all
in
the
green
where
the
ovation
in
the
new
curé
honour
took
a
more
familiar
and
affectionate
turn
the
ladies
grouped
themselves
together
and
spoke
of
the
cathedral
organ
which
wanted
repairing
and
madame
de
condamin
promised
a
magnificent
altar
for
the
procession
on
the
approaching
festival
of
corpus
christi
abbé
bourrette
was
sharing
in
the
general
triumph
when
madame
paloque
craning
out
her
hideous
face
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
murmured
in
his
ear
reverence
wo
i
suppose
hear
confessions
in
chapel
the
priest
while
taking
abbé
compan
duty
had
occupied
the
confessional
in
chapel
which
was
the
largest
and
most
convenient
in
the
church
and
was
specially
reserved
for
the
curé
he
did
not
at
first
understand
the
force
of
madame
paloque
remark
and
he
looked
at
her
again
blinking
his
eyes
ask
you
she
continued
you
will
resume
your
old
confessional
in
the
chapel
of
the
holy
angels
he
turned
rather
pale
and
remained
silent
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
bent
his
gaze
to
the
floor
and
a
slight
shiver
coursed
down
his
neck
as
though
he
had
received
a
blow
from
behind
and
seeing
that
madame
paloque
was
still
there
staring
at
him
he
stammered
out
i
shall
go
back
to
my
old
confessional
come
to
the
chapel
of
the
holy
angels
the
last
one
on
the
left
on
the
same
side
as
the
cloisters
it
is
very
damp
so
wrap
yourself
up
well
dear
madame
wrap
yourself
up
well
tears
rose
to
his
eyes
he
was
filled
with
regretful
longing
for
that
handsome
confessional
in
the
chapel
of
into
which
the
warm
sun
streamed
in
the
afternoon
just
at
the
time
when
he
heard
confessions
until
now
he
had
felt
no
sorrow
at
relinquishing
the
cathedral
to
abbé
faujas
but
this
little
matter
this
removal
from
one
chapel
to
another
affected
him
very
painfully
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
missed
the
goal
of
his
life
madame
paloque
told
him
in
her
loud
voice
that
he
appeared
to
have
grown
melancholy
all
at
once
but
he
protested
against
this
assertion
and
tried
to
smile
and
look
cheerful
again
however
he
left
the
early
in
the
evening
abbé
faujas
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
rougon
came
up
to
him
to
offer
his
congratulations
and
they
remained
talking
earnestly
together
on
a
couch
they
spoke
of
the
necessity
of
religious
feeling
in
a
wisely
ordered
state
each
lady
on
retiring
from
the
room
made
a
low
bow
as
she
passed
in
front
of
them
know
monsieur
le
curé
said
félicité
graciously
you
are
my
daughter
cavalier
the
priest
rose
from
his
seat
marthe
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
when
they
got
out
into
the
street
they
seemed
as
if
blinded
by
the
darkness
and
crossed
the
place
of
the
without
exchanging
a
word
but
in
the
rue
balande
as
they
stood
in
front
of
the
house
marthe
touched
the
priest
arm
at
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
insert
the
key
in
the
lock
am
so
very
pleased
at
your
success
she
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
great
emotion
kind
to
me
and
grant
me
the
favour
which
you
have
hitherto
refused
i
assure
you
that
abbé
bourrette
does
not
understand
me
it
is
only
you
who
can
direct
and
save
me
he
motioned
her
away
from
him
and
when
he
had
opened
the
door
and
lighted
the
little
lamp
which
rose
had
left
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
he
went
upstairs
saying
to
her
gently
as
he
did
so
promised
me
to
be
reasonable
well
i
will
think
over
what
you
have
asked
we
will
talk
about
it
marthe
did
not
retire
to
her
own
room
until
she
had
heard
the
priest
close
his
door
on
the
upper
floor
while
she
was
undressing
and
getting
into
bed
she
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
mouret
who
half
asleep
was
retailing
to
her
at
great
length
some
gossip
that
was
being
circulated
in
the
town
he
had
been
to
his
club
the
commercial
club
a
place
where
he
rarely
set
foot
faujas
has
got
the
better
of
abbé
bourrette
he
repeated
for
the
tenth
time
as
he
slowly
rolled
his
head
upon
the
pillow
abbé
bourrette
well
never
mind
it
good
fun
to
see
those
parsons
devouring
one
another
the
other
day
when
they
were
hugging
each
other
in
the
garden
you
remember
it
do
you
anyone
would
have
thought
that
they
were
brothers
ah
they
rob
each
other
even
of
their
very
penitents
but
why
do
you
say
anything
my
dear
you
do
agree
with
me
eh
or
is
it
because
you
are
going
to
sleep
well
well
then
my
dear
he
fell
asleep
still
muttering
disjointed
words
while
marthe
with
widely
opened
eyes
stared
up
into
the
air
and
followed
over
the
ceiling
faintly
illumined
by
the
the
pattering
of
the
abbé
slippers
while
he
was
retiring
to
rest
xii
at
the
return
of
summer
abbé
faujas
and
his
mother
again
came
downstairs
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
on
the
terrace
mouret
had
become
very
he
declined
the
old
lady
invitations
to
play
piquet
and
sat
swaying
himself
about
on
a
chair
seeing
him
yawn
without
making
any
attempt
to
conceal
how
bored
he
was
feeling
marthe
said
to
him
do
you
go
to
your
club
my
dear
he
now
went
there
more
frequently
than
he
had
been
used
to
do
when
he
returned
he
found
his
wife
and
the
abbé
still
in
the
same
place
on
the
terrace
while
madame
faujas
a
few
yards
away
from
them
preserved
the
demeanour
of
a
blind
and
dumb
guardian
when
anyone
in
the
town
spoke
to
mouret
of
the
new
curé
he
still
continued
to
sound
his
praises
faujas
said
he
was
decidedly
a
superior
sort
of
man
and
he
himself
had
never
felt
any
doubt
of
his
great
abilities
madame
paloque
could
never
succeed
in
drawing
a
hostile
word
from
him
on
the
subject
of
the
priest
in
spite
of
the
malicious
way
in
which
she
would
ask
him
after
his
wife
in
the
midst
of
his
remarks
about
abbé
faujas
old
madame
rougon
had
no
better
success
in
her
attempts
to
unveil
the
secret
troubles
which
she
thought
she
could
detect
beneath
mouret
outward
show
of
cheerfulness
she
laid
all
sorts
of
traps
for
him
as
she
watched
his
face
with
her
sharp
shrewd
smile
but
that
inveterate
chatterer
whose
tongue
was
a
regular
bell
now
showed
the
greatest
reserve
when
any
reference
was
made
to
his
household
your
husband
has
become
reasonable
at
last
félicité
remarked
to
her
daughter
one
day
leaves
you
free
marthe
looked
at
her
mother
with
an
air
of
surprise
have
always
been
free
she
said
my
dear
child
i
see
that
you
do
want
to
say
anything
against
him
you
told
me
once
that
he
looked
very
unfavourably
upon
abbé
faujas
of
the
kind
i
assure
you
you
must
have
imagined
it
my
husband
is
upon
the
best
terms
with
abbé
faujas
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
make
them
otherwise
marthe
was
much
astonished
at
the
persistence
with
which
everybody
seemed
to
imagine
that
her
husband
and
the
abbé
were
not
good
friends
frequently
at
the
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
the
ladies
put
questions
to
her
which
made
her
quite
impatient
she
was
really
very
happy
and
contented
and
the
house
in
the
rue
balande
had
never
seemed
pleasanter
to
her
than
it
did
now
abbé
faujas
had
given
her
to
understand
that
he
would
undertake
her
spiritual
direction
as
soon
as
he
should
be
of
opinion
that
abbé
bourrette
was
no
longer
sufficient
and
she
lived
in
this
hope
her
mind
full
of
simple
joy
like
a
girl
who
is
promised
some
pretty
religious
pictures
if
she
keeps
good
every
now
and
then
indeed
she
felt
as
though
she
were
becoming
a
child
again
she
experienced
a
freshness
of
feeling
and
impulses
that
filled
her
with
gentle
emotion
one
day
in
the
as
mouret
was
pruning
his
tall
box
plants
he
found
her
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
beneath
the
young
shoots
of
the
arbour
with
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
is
the
matter
my
dear
he
asked
anxiously
she
said
with
a
smile
at
all
really
i
am
very
happy
very
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
on
delicately
cutting
the
box
plants
into
an
even
line
he
took
considerable
pride
in
having
the
neatest
trimmed
hedges
in
the
neighbourhood
marthe
had
wiped
her
eyes
but
she
soon
began
to
weep
again
feeling
a
choking
sensation
at
the
scent
of
the
severed
verdure
she
was
forty
years
old
now
and
it
was
for
her
youth
that
she
was
weeping
since
his
appointment
as
curé
of
abbé
faujas
had
shown
a
dignity
which
seemed
to
increase
his
stature
he
carried
his
breviary
and
his
hat
with
an
air
of
authority
which
he
had
exhibited
at
the
cathedral
in
such
wise
as
to
ensure
himself
the
respect
of
the
clergy
abbé
fenil
having
sustained
another
defeat
on
two
or
three
matters
of
detail
now
seemed
to
have
left
his
adversary
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
abbé
faujas
however
was
not
foolish
enough
to
make
any
indiscreet
use
of
his
triumph
but
showed
himself
extremely
supple
he
was
quite
conscious
that
plassans
was
still
far
from
being
his
and
so
though
he
stopped
every
now
and
then
in
the
street
to
shake
hands
with
monsieur
delangre
he
merely
exchanged
passing
salutations
with
monsieur
de
bourdeu
monsieur
maffre
and
the
other
guests
of
monsieur
rastoil
a
large
section
of
society
in
the
town
still
looked
upon
him
with
suspicion
they
found
fault
with
him
for
the
want
of
frankness
in
his
political
opinions
in
their
estimation
he
ought
to
explain
himself
declare
himself
in
favour
of
one
party
or
another
but
the
abbé
only
smiled
and
said
that
he
belonged
to
honest
party
a
reply
which
spared
him
a
more
explicit
declaration
moreover
he
showed
no
haste
or
anxiety
but
continued
to
keep
aloof
till
the
should
open
their
doors
to
him
of
their
own
accord
my
friend
not
now
later
on
we
will
see
about
it
he
said
to
abbé
bourrette
who
had
been
pressing
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
monsieur
rastoil
he
was
known
to
have
refused
two
invitations
to
the
and
the
mourets
were
still
the
only
people
with
whom
he
continued
intimate
there
he
was
as
it
were
occupying
a
post
of
observation
between
two
hostile
camps
on
tuesdays
when
the
two
sets
of
guests
assembled
in
the
gardens
on
his
right
and
left
he
took
up
his
position
at
his
window
and
watched
the
sunset
in
the
distance
behind
the
forests
of
the
seille
and
then
before
withdrawing
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
replied
with
as
much
amiability
to
the
bows
of
monsieur
rastoil
guests
as
to
those
of
the
his
intercourse
with
his
neighbours
as
yet
went
no
further
than
this
on
tuesday
however
he
went
down
into
the
garden
he
was
quite
at
home
now
in
mouret
grounds
and
no
longer
confined
himself
to
pacing
up
and
down
beneath
the
arbour
as
he
read
his
breviary
all
the
walks
and
beds
seemed
to
belong
to
him
his
cassock
glided
blackly
past
all
the
greenery
on
that
particular
tuesday
as
he
made
a
tour
of
the
garden
he
caught
sight
of
monsieur
maffre
and
madame
rastoil
below
him
and
bowed
to
them
and
then
as
he
passed
below
the
terrace
of
the
he
saw
monsieur
de
condamin
leaning
there
in
company
with
doctor
porquier
after
an
exchange
of
salutations
the
priest
was
turning
along
the
path
when
the
doctor
called
to
him
a
word
your
reverence
i
beg
then
he
asked
him
at
what
time
he
could
see
him
the
following
day
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
any
one
of
the
two
sets
of
guests
had
spoken
to
the
priest
from
one
garden
to
the
other
the
doctor
was
in
great
trouble
however
his
scamp
of
a
son
had
been
caught
in
a
gambling
den
behind
the
gaol
in
company
with
other
worthless
characters
the
most
distressing
part
of
the
matter
was
that
guillaume
was
accused
of
being
the
leader
of
the
band
and
of
having
led
monsieur
maffre
sons
much
younger
than
himself
astray
said
monsieur
de
condamin
with
his
sceptical
laugh
men
must
sow
their
wild
oats
what
a
fuss
about
nothing
here
the
whole
town
in
a
state
of
perturbation
because
some
young
fellows
have
been
caught
playing
baccarat
and
there
happened
to
be
a
lady
with
them
the
doctor
seemed
very
much
shocked
at
this
want
to
ask
your
advice
he
said
addressing
himself
to
the
priest
maffre
came
to
my
house
boiling
over
with
anger
and
assailed
me
with
the
bitterest
reproaches
crying
out
that
it
was
all
my
fault
as
i
had
brought
my
son
up
badly
i
am
extremely
distressed
and
troubled
about
it
monsieur
maffre
ought
to
know
me
better
i
have
sixty
years
of
stainless
life
behind
me
he
went
on
wailing
dwelling
upon
the
sacrifices
that
he
had
made
for
his
son
and
expressing
his
fears
that
he
would
lose
his
practice
in
consequence
of
the
young
man
misconduct
abbé
faujas
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
path
raised
his
head
and
gravely
listened
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
he
said
kindly
will
see
monsieur
maffre
and
will
let
him
understand
that
his
natural
indignation
has
carried
him
too
far
i
will
go
at
once
and
ask
him
to
appoint
a
meeting
with
me
for
he
is
over
there
on
the
other
side
the
abbé
crossed
the
garden
and
went
towards
monsieur
maffre
who
was
still
there
with
madame
rastoil
when
the
justice
of
the
peace
found
that
the
priest
desired
an
interview
with
him
he
would
not
hear
of
his
taking
any
trouble
about
it
but
put
himself
at
his
disposition
saying
that
he
would
do
himself
the
honour
of
calling
upon
him
the
next
day
monsieur
le
curé
madame
rastoil
then
remarked
me
compliment
you
upon
your
sermon
last
sunday
all
the
ladies
were
much
affected
by
it
i
assure
you
the
abbé
bowed
and
crossed
the
garden
again
in
order
to
reassure
doctor
porquier
then
he
continued
slowly
pacing
about
the
walks
till
nightfall
without
taking
part
in
any
further
conversations
but
ever
hearing
the
merriment
of
the
groups
of
guests
on
his
right
hand
and
his
left
when
monsieur
maffre
appeared
the
next
day
abbé
faujas
was
watching
a
couple
of
men
who
were
at
work
repairing
the
fountain
in
the
garden
he
had
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
fountain
play
again
for
the
empty
basin
said
he
had
such
a
melancholy
appearance
at
first
mouret
had
not
seemed
very
willing
to
have
anything
done
alleging
the
probability
of
accidents
with
désirée
but
marthe
had
prevailed
upon
him
to
let
the
repairs
be
executed
upon
the
understanding
that
the
basin
should
be
protected
by
a
railing
le
curé
said
rose
justice
of
the
peace
wishes
to
see
you
abbé
faujas
hastened
indoors
he
wanted
to
take
monsieur
maffre
up
to
his
own
room
on
the
second
floor
but
rose
had
already
opened
the
door
in
she
said
you
at
home
here
it
is
useless
to
make
the
justice
go
up
two
flights
of
stairs
if
you
had
only
told
me
this
morning
i
would
have
given
the
room
a
dusting
as
she
closed
the
door
upon
the
abbé
and
the
magistrate
after
opening
the
shutters
mouret
called
her
into
the
right
rose
he
cried
had
better
give
my
dinner
to
your
priest
this
evening
and
if
he
has
got
sufficient
blankets
of
his
own
upstairs
you
can
take
mine
off
my
bed
the
cook
exchanged
a
meaning
glance
with
marthe
who
was
working
by
the
window
waiting
till
the
sunshine
should
leave
the
terrace
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
said
sir
you
have
never
had
a
charitable
heart
she
took
herself
off
while
marthe
continued
sewing
without
raising
her
head
for
the
last
few
days
she
had
with
feverish
energy
again
applied
herself
to
her
needlework
she
was
embroidering
an
as
a
gift
for
the
cathedral
the
ladies
were
desirous
of
giving
a
complete
set
of
altar
furniture
madame
rastoil
and
madame
delangre
had
undertaken
to
present
the
candlesticks
and
madame
de
condamin
had
ordered
a
magnificent
silver
crucifix
from
paris
meantime
in
the
abbé
faujas
was
gently
remonstrating
with
monsieur
maffre
telling
him
that
doctor
porquier
was
a
religious
man
and
a
person
of
the
highest
integrity
and
that
no
one
could
be
more
pained
than
he
by
his
son
deplorable
conduct
the
magistrate
listened
with
a
sanctimonious
air
and
his
heavy
features
and
big
prominent
eyes
assumed
quite
an
ecstatic
expression
at
certain
pious
remarks
which
the
priest
uttered
in
a
very
moving
manner
he
allowed
that
he
had
been
rather
too
hasty
and
declared
that
he
was
willing
to
make
every
apology
as
his
reverence
thought
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
must
send
your
own
sons
to
me
said
the
priest
i
will
talk
to
them
monsieur
maffre
shook
his
head
with
a
slight
sneering
laugh
you
need
be
afraid
about
them
monsieur
le
curé
the
young
scamps
wo
play
any
more
tricks
they
have
been
locked
up
in
their
rooms
for
the
last
three
days
with
nothing
but
bread
and
water
if
i
had
had
a
stick
in
my
hand
when
i
found
out
what
they
had
been
doing
i
should
have
broken
it
across
their
backs
the
abbé
looked
at
him
and
recollected
how
mouret
had
accused
him
of
having
killed
his
wife
by
harshness
and
avarice
then
with
a
gesture
of
protest
he
added
no
that
is
not
the
way
to
treat
young
men
your
elder
son
ambroise
is
twenty
years
old
and
the
younger
is
nearly
eighteen
he
they
are
no
longer
children
remember
you
must
allow
them
some
amusements
the
magistrate
remained
silent
with
surprise
you
would
let
them
go
on
smoking
and
allow
them
to
frequent
cafés
he
said
presently
replied
the
priest
with
a
smile
think
that
young
men
should
be
allowed
to
meet
together
to
talk
and
smoke
their
cigarettes
and
even
to
play
a
game
of
billiards
or
chess
they
will
give
themselves
every
license
if
you
show
no
tolerance
only
remember
that
it
is
not
to
every
café
that
i
should
be
willing
for
them
to
go
i
should
like
to
see
a
special
one
provided
for
them
a
sort
of
club
as
i
have
seen
done
in
several
towns
then
he
unfolded
a
complete
scheme
for
such
a
club
monsieur
maffre
gradually
seemed
to
appreciate
it
he
nodded
his
head
as
he
said
capital
it
would
be
a
worthy
pendant
to
the
home
of
the
virgin
really
monsieur
le
curé
we
must
put
such
a
splendid
idea
as
this
into
execution
then
the
priest
concluded
as
he
accompanied
monsieur
maffre
to
the
door
you
approve
of
the
plan
just
advocate
it
among
your
friends
i
will
see
monsieur
delangre
and
speak
to
him
about
it
we
might
meet
in
the
cathedral
on
sunday
after
vespers
and
come
to
some
decision
on
the
sunday
monsieur
maffre
brought
monsieur
rastoil
with
him
they
found
abbé
faujas
and
monsieur
delangre
in
a
little
room
adjoining
the
sacristy
the
gentlemen
displayed
great
enthusiasm
in
favour
of
the
priest
idea
and
the
institution
of
a
young
men
club
was
agreed
upon
in
principle
there
was
considerable
discussion
however
as
to
what
it
should
be
called
monsieur
maffre
was
strongly
desirous
that
it
should
be
known
as
the
guild
of
jesus
no
no
the
priest
impatiently
cried
at
last
would
get
scarcely
anyone
to
join
and
the
few
members
would
only
be
jeered
at
there
must
be
no
attempt
to
tack
religion
on
to
the
business
indeed
i
intend
that
we
should
leave
religion
outside
its
doors
altogether
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
win
the
young
people
over
to
our
side
by
providing
them
with
some
innocent
recreation
that
is
all
the
justice
of
the
peace
gazed
at
the
priest
with
such
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
anxiety
that
monsieur
delangre
was
obliged
to
bend
his
head
to
conceal
a
smile
while
he
slyly
pulled
the
abbé
cassock
then
the
priest
went
on
in
a
calmer
voice
am
sure
gentlemen
that
you
do
not
feel
any
distrust
of
me
and
i
ask
you
to
leave
the
management
of
the
matter
in
my
hands
i
propose
to
adopt
some
very
simple
name
such
a
one
for
instance
as
the
young
men
club
which
fully
expresses
all
that
is
required
monsieur
rastoil
and
monsieur
maffre
bowed
although
this
title
seemed
to
them
a
little
weak
they
next
spoke
of
nominating
the
curé
as
president
of
a
provisional
committee
fancy
said
monsieur
delangre
glancing
at
the
priest
this
suggestion
will
scarcely
meet
with
his
reverence
approbation
dear
no
the
abbé
exclaimed
slightly
shrugging
his
shoulders
cassock
would
frighten
the
timid
and
lukewarm
away
we
should
only
get
the
pious
young
people
and
it
is
not
for
them
that
we
are
going
to
found
our
club
what
we
want
is
to
gather
in
the
wanderers
to
win
converts
in
a
word
is
that
so
replied
the
presiding
judge
well
then
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
keep
ourselves
in
the
background
myself
especially
what
i
propose
is
this
your
son
monsieur
rastoil
and
yours
monsieur
delangre
will
alone
come
forward
it
must
appear
as
if
they
themselves
had
formed
the
idea
of
this
club
send
them
to
me
in
the
morning
and
i
will
talk
the
matter
over
at
length
with
them
i
already
have
a
suitable
building
in
my
mind
and
a
code
of
rules
quite
prepared
your
two
sons
monsieur
maffre
will
naturally
be
enrolled
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
members
the
presiding
judge
seemed
flattered
at
the
part
assigned
to
his
son
and
so
matters
were
arranged
in
this
way
notwithstanding
the
resistance
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
hoped
to
win
some
personal
distinction
from
the
founding
of
the
club
the
next
day
séverin
rastoil
and
lucien
delangre
put
themselves
in
communication
with
abbé
faujas
séverin
was
a
tall
young
man
of
with
a
badly
shaped
skull
and
a
dull
brain
who
had
just
been
called
to
the
bar
thanks
to
the
position
which
his
father
held
the
latter
was
anxiously
dreaming
of
making
him
a
public
prosecutor
assessor
despairing
of
his
ever
succeeding
in
winning
any
practice
for
himself
lucien
on
the
other
hand
was
short
and
had
a
crafty
mind
and
pleaded
with
all
the
coolness
of
an
old
practitioner
although
he
was
a
year
younger
than
séverin
the
gazette
spoke
of
him
as
a
future
light
of
the
bar
it
was
more
particularly
to
him
that
the
abbé
gave
the
minutest
instructions
as
to
his
scheme
as
for
young
rastoil
he
simply
went
fussing
about
bursting
with
importance
in
three
weeks
the
young
men
club
was
founded
and
opened
there
was
at
that
time
beneath
the
church
of
the
minimes
situated
at
the
end
of
the
cours
sauvaire
a
number
of
very
large
rooms
and
an
old
monastery
refectory
which
were
no
longer
put
to
any
use
this
was
the
place
that
abbé
faujas
had
thought
of
for
the
club
and
the
clergy
of
the
parish
very
willingly
allowed
him
to
use
the
rooms
one
morning
when
the
provisional
committee
of
the
young
men
club
had
set
workmen
going
in
this
place
the
citizens
of
plassans
were
quite
astounded
to
see
what
appeared
to
be
a
café
being
fitted
up
under
the
church
five
days
afterwards
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
doubt
on
the
point
the
place
was
certainly
going
to
be
a
café
divans
were
being
brought
thither
with
tables
chairs
two
and
even
three
crates
of
crockery
and
glass
an
entrance
was
contrived
at
the
end
of
the
building
as
far
as
possible
from
the
doorway
of
the
church
and
great
crimson
curtains
genuine
were
hung
behind
the
glass
panes
you
descended
five
stone
steps
and
on
opening
the
door
found
yourself
in
a
large
hall
to
the
right
of
which
there
was
a
smaller
one
and
a
while
in
a
square
room
at
the
far
end
were
placed
the
two
they
were
exactly
beneath
the
high
altar
my
poor
boys
said
guillaume
porquier
one
day
to
monsieur
maffre
two
sons
whom
he
had
met
on
the
cours
they
are
going
to
make
you
serve
at
mass
between
your
games
at
bézique
however
ambroise
and
alphonse
besought
him
not
to
speak
to
them
in
public
as
their
father
had
threatened
to
send
them
to
sea
if
they
continued
to
associate
with
him
when
the
first
astonishment
was
over
the
young
men
club
proved
a
great
success
monseigneur
rousselot
accepted
the
honorary
presidency
and
even
visited
it
in
person
one
evening
attended
by
his
secretary
abbé
surin
each
of
them
drank
a
glass
of
in
the
smaller
room
and
the
glass
which
his
lordship
used
was
preserved
with
great
respect
upon
a
sideboard
the
bishop
visit
is
still
talked
of
with
much
emotion
at
plassans
and
it
brought
about
the
adherence
of
all
the
fashionable
young
men
of
the
town
it
was
soon
considered
very
bad
style
not
to
belong
to
the
young
men
club
guillaume
porquier
however
used
to
prowl
about
the
entrance
sniggering
like
a
young
wolf
who
dreams
of
making
his
way
into
a
notwithstanding
all
the
fear
they
had
of
their
father
monsieur
maffre
sons
quite
worshipped
this
shameless
young
man
who
regaled
them
with
stories
of
paris
and
entertained
them
at
secret
little
parties
in
the
suburbs
they
had
got
into
the
habit
of
meeting
him
regularly
every
saturday
evening
at
nine
near
a
certain
seat
on
the
mall
they
slipped
away
from
the
club
and
sat
gossiping
till
eleven
concealed
beneath
the
dark
shade
of
the
on
these
occasions
guillaume
always
twitted
them
about
the
evenings
they
spent
underneath
the
church
of
the
minimes
is
very
kind
of
you
he
would
say
let
yourselves
be
led
by
the
nose
the
verger
gives
you
glasses
of
sugar
and
water
as
though
he
were
administering
the
communion
to
you
does
he
of
the
sort
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
assure
you
ambroise
exclaimed
might
fancy
you
were
in
the
café
du
cours
or
the
café
de
france
or
the
café
des
voyageurs
we
drink
beer
or
punch
or
madeira
whatever
we
like
whatever
is
drunk
in
other
places
guillaume
continued
jeering
however
i
should
like
to
go
drinking
their
dirty
stuff
he
said
should
be
afraid
that
they
had
mixed
some
drug
with
it
to
make
me
go
to
confession
i
suppose
you
amuse
yourselves
by
playing
at
and
the
young
maffres
gaily
laughed
at
his
pleasantries
but
they
took
care
to
undeceive
him
they
told
him
that
even
cards
were
allowed
and
that
there
was
no
flavour
of
a
church
about
the
place
at
all
the
club
was
extremely
pleasant
there
were
very
comfortable
couches
and
mirrors
all
over
said
guillaume
never
make
me
believe
that
you
hear
the
organ
when
there
is
an
evening
service
at
the
church
it
would
make
me
swallow
my
coffee
the
wrong
way
only
to
know
that
there
was
a
baptism
or
a
marriage
or
a
funeral
going
on
over
my
cup
there
something
in
that
alphonse
allowed
the
other
day
while
i
was
playing
at
billiards
with
séverin
in
the
we
could
distinctly
hear
a
funeral
going
on
it
was
the
funeral
of
the
butcher
little
girl
the
butcher
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
that
fellow
séverin
is
a
big
jackass
he
tried
to
frighten
me
by
telling
me
that
the
whole
funeral
would
fall
through
on
our
heads
well
it
must
be
a
very
pleasant
place
that
club
of
yours
cried
guillaume
would
set
foot
in
it
for
all
the
money
in
the
world
i
as
soon
go
and
drink
my
coffee
in
a
sacristy
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
guillaume
felt
very
much
vexed
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
young
men
club
his
father
had
forbidden
him
to
offer
himself
for
election
fearing
that
he
would
be
rejected
at
last
however
the
young
man
grew
so
annoyed
about
the
matter
that
he
sent
in
an
application
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
club
without
mentioning
what
he
had
done
to
his
people
the
question
was
a
very
serious
one
the
committee
which
elected
the
members
then
comprised
the
young
maffres
amongst
its
number
and
lucien
delangre
was
its
president
and
séverin
rastoil
its
secretary
these
young
men
felt
terribly
embarrassed
while
they
did
not
dare
to
grant
guillaume
application
they
were
unwilling
to
do
anything
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
doctor
porquier
so
worthy
and
irreproachable
a
person
one
too
who
was
so
completely
trusted
by
all
the
fashionable
ladies
at
last
ambroise
and
alphonse
begged
guillaume
not
to
press
his
application
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
no
chance
of
being
admitted
are
a
couple
of
pitiful
poltroons
he
replied
to
them
you
suppose
that
i
care
a
fig
about
joining
your
brotherhood
i
was
only
amusing
myself
i
wanted
to
see
if
you
would
have
the
courage
to
vote
against
me
i
shall
have
a
good
laugh
when
those
hypocrites
bang
the
door
in
my
face
as
for
you
my
good
little
boys
you
can
go
and
amuse
yourselves
where
you
like
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
the
young
maffres
in
great
consternation
then
besought
lucien
delangre
to
try
to
arrange
matters
in
such
a
way
as
would
prevent
any
unpleasantness
lucien
submitted
the
difficulty
to
his
usual
adviser
abbé
faujas
for
whom
he
had
conceived
a
genuine
admiration
the
abbé
came
to
the
young
men
club
every
afternoon
from
five
till
six
he
walked
through
the
big
room
with
a
pleasant
smile
nodding
and
sometimes
stopping
for
a
few
minutes
at
one
of
the
tables
to
chat
with
some
of
the
young
men
however
he
never
accepted
anything
to
drink
not
even
a
glass
of
water
afterwards
he
passed
into
the
and
taking
a
seat
at
the
long
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
he
attentively
pored
over
the
newspapers
which
the
club
received
the
legitimist
organs
of
paris
and
the
neighbouring
departments
occasionally
he
made
a
rapid
note
in
a
little
then
he
went
quietly
away
again
smiling
at
the
members
who
were
present
and
shaking
hands
with
them
on
some
occasions
however
he
remained
for
a
longer
time
to
watch
a
game
at
chess
or
chat
merrily
about
all
kinds
of
matters
the
young
men
who
were
extremely
fond
of
him
used
to
say
that
when
he
talked
no
one
would
take
him
for
a
priest
when
the
mayor
son
told
him
of
the
embarrassment
which
application
had
caused
the
committee
abbé
faujas
promised
to
arrange
the
affair
and
next
morning
he
went
to
see
doctor
porquier
to
whom
he
related
everything
the
doctor
was
aghast
his
son
he
cried
was
determined
to
kill
him
with
distress
by
dishonouring
his
grey
hairs
what
could
be
done
now
even
if
the
application
were
withdrawn
the
shame
and
disgrace
would
be
none
the
less
the
priest
then
advised
him
to
send
guillaume
away
for
two
or
three
months
to
an
estate
which
he
possessed
a
few
leagues
from
plassans
and
undertook
to
charge
himself
with
the
further
conduct
of
the
affair
as
soon
as
guillaume
had
left
the
town
the
committee
postponed
the
consideration
of
his
application
saying
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
haste
in
the
matter
as
the
applicant
was
absent
and
that
a
decision
could
be
taken
later
on
doctor
porquier
heard
of
this
solution
from
lucien
delangre
one
afternoon
when
he
was
in
the
garden
of
the
he
immediately
hastened
to
the
terrace
it
was
the
hour
when
abbé
faujas
read
his
breviary
doctor
porquier
caught
sight
of
him
under
the
mourets
arbour
monsieur
le
curé
he
cried
can
i
thank
you
i
should
like
very
much
to
shake
hands
with
you
wall
is
rather
high
said
the
priest
looking
at
it
with
a
smile
but
doctor
porquier
was
an
effusive
individual
who
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
discouraged
by
obstacles
a
moment
he
cried
you
will
allow
me
monsieur
le
curé
i
will
come
round
then
he
disappeared
the
abbé
still
smiling
slowly
bent
his
steps
towards
the
little
door
which
opened
into
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
the
doctor
was
already
gently
knocking
at
it
this
door
is
nailed
up
said
the
priest
of
the
nails
is
broken
though
if
i
had
any
sort
of
a
tool
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
other
one
out
he
glanced
round
him
and
caught
sight
of
a
spade
then
after
he
had
drawn
back
the
bolts
with
a
slight
effort
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
alley
where
doctor
porquier
overwhelmed
him
with
thanks
and
compliments
as
they
walked
along
talking
monsieur
maffre
who
happened
at
the
time
to
be
in
monsieur
rastoil
garden
opened
a
little
door
that
was
hidden
away
behind
the
presiding
waterfall
the
gentlemen
were
much
amused
to
find
themselves
all
three
in
this
deserted
little
lane
they
remained
there
for
a
few
moments
and
as
they
took
leave
of
the
abbé
the
magistrate
and
the
doctor
poked
their
heads
inside
the
mourets
garden
looking
about
them
with
curiosity
mouret
however
who
was
putting
stakes
to
his
tomatoes
raised
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
them
he
was
fairly
lost
in
astonishment
so
they
made
their
way
in
here
he
muttered
curé
now
only
has
to
bring
in
both
gangs
xiii
serge
was
now
nineteen
years
of
age
he
occupied
a
small
room
on
the
second
floor
opposite
the
priest
and
there
led
an
almost
cloistered
life
spending
much
time
in
reading
shall
have
to
throw
those
old
books
of
yours
into
the
fire
mouret
said
to
him
angrily
end
by
making
yourself
ill
and
having
to
take
to
your
bed
the
young
man
was
indeed
of
such
a
nervous
temperament
that
the
slightest
imprudence
made
him
poorly
as
though
he
were
a
young
girl
and
thus
he
was
frequently
confined
to
his
room
for
two
or
three
days
together
at
these
times
rose
inundated
him
with
herb
tea
and
whenever
mouret
went
upstairs
to
shake
him
up
a
little
as
he
called
it
the
cook
if
she
happened
to
be
there
would
turn
her
master
out
of
the
room
crying
out
at
him
the
poor
dear
alone
ca
you
see
that
you
are
killing
him
with
your
rough
ways
it
is
after
you
that
he
takes
he
is
the
very
image
of
his
mother
and
you
never
be
able
to
understand
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
serge
smiled
after
he
had
left
college
his
father
seeing
him
so
delicate
had
hesitated
to
send
him
to
paris
to
read
for
the
bar
there
he
would
not
hear
however
of
a
provincial
faculty
paris
he
felt
sure
was
necessary
for
a
young
man
who
wanted
to
climb
to
a
high
position
he
tried
indeed
to
instil
ambitious
ideas
into
the
lad
telling
him
that
many
with
much
weaker
wits
than
his
own
his
cousins
the
rougons
for
instance
had
attained
to
great
distinction
every
time
that
the
young
man
seemed
to
grow
more
robust
his
father
settled
that
he
should
leave
home
early
the
following
month
but
his
trunk
was
never
packed
for
serge
was
always
catching
a
fresh
cold
and
then
his
departure
would
be
again
postponed
on
each
of
these
occasions
marthe
contented
herself
with
saying
in
her
gentle
indifferent
way
is
twenty
yet
it
really
not
prudent
to
send
so
young
a
lad
to
paris
and
besides
he
is
wasting
his
time
here
you
even
think
that
he
studies
too
much
serge
used
to
accompany
his
mother
to
mass
he
was
very
piously
minded
very
gentle
and
grave
doctor
porquier
had
recommended
him
to
take
a
good
deal
of
exercise
and
he
had
become
enthusiastically
fond
of
botany
going
off
on
long
rambles
to
collect
specimens
which
he
spent
his
afternoons
in
drying
mounting
classifying
and
naming
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
struck
up
a
great
friendship
with
abbé
faujas
the
abbé
himself
had
botanised
in
earlier
days
and
he
gave
serge
much
practical
advice
for
which
the
young
man
was
very
grateful
they
also
lent
each
other
books
and
one
day
they
went
off
together
to
try
to
discover
a
certain
plant
which
the
priest
said
he
thought
would
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
when
serge
was
ill
his
neighbour
came
to
see
him
every
morning
and
sat
and
talked
for
a
long
while
at
his
bedside
at
other
times
when
the
young
man
was
well
it
was
he
who
went
and
knocked
at
abbé
faujas
door
as
soon
as
he
heard
him
stirring
in
his
room
they
were
only
separated
by
a
narrow
landing
and
they
ended
by
almost
living
together
in
spite
of
marthe
unruffled
tranquillity
and
rose
angry
glances
mouret
still
often
indulged
in
bursts
of
anger
can
the
young
scamp
be
after
up
there
he
would
growl
days
pass
without
my
catching
more
than
a
glimpse
of
him
he
never
seems
to
stir
from
the
abbé
they
are
always
talking
together
in
some
corner
or
other
he
shall
be
off
to
paris
at
once
he
as
strong
as
a
turk
all
those
ailments
of
his
are
mere
shams
excuses
to
get
himself
petted
and
coddled
you
need
both
of
you
look
at
me
in
that
way
i
do
mean
to
let
the
priest
make
a
hypocrite
of
the
boy
then
he
began
to
keep
a
watch
over
his
son
and
when
he
thought
that
he
was
in
faujas
room
he
called
for
him
angrily
would
rather
he
went
to
the
bad
he
cried
one
day
in
a
fit
of
rage
sir
said
rose
is
abominable
to
say
such
things
indeed
i
would
and
i
put
him
in
the
way
myself
one
of
these
days
if
you
irritate
me
much
more
with
these
parsons
of
yours
serge
naturally
joined
the
young
men
club
though
he
went
there
but
little
preferring
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
if
it
had
not
been
for
abbé
faujas
whom
he
sometimes
met
there
he
would
probably
never
have
set
foot
in
the
place
the
abbé
taught
him
to
play
chess
in
the
mouret
on
learning
that
the
lad
met
the
priest
at
the
café
swore
that
he
would
pack
him
off
by
the
train
on
the
following
monday
his
luggage
was
indeed
got
ready
and
quite
seriously
this
time
but
serge
who
had
gone
out
to
spend
a
last
day
in
the
open
country
returned
home
drenched
to
the
skin
by
a
sudden
downpour
of
rain
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
shivering
with
fever
for
three
weeks
he
hung
between
life
and
death
and
then
his
convalescence
lasted
for
two
long
months
at
the
beginning
of
it
he
was
so
weak
that
he
lay
with
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
his
arms
stretched
over
the
sheets
as
motionless
as
if
he
were
simply
a
wax
figure
is
your
fault
sir
cried
the
cook
to
mouret
will
have
it
on
your
conscience
if
the
boy
dies
while
his
son
continued
in
danger
mouret
wandered
silently
about
the
house
plunged
in
gloomy
melancholy
his
eyes
red
with
crying
he
seldom
went
upstairs
but
paced
up
and
down
the
passage
to
intercept
the
doctor
as
he
went
away
when
he
was
told
that
serge
was
at
length
out
of
danger
he
glided
quietly
into
the
lad
room
and
offered
his
help
but
rose
turned
him
away
they
had
no
occasion
for
him
she
said
and
the
boy
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
bear
his
roughness
he
had
much
better
go
and
attend
to
his
business
instead
of
getting
in
the
way
there
mouret
then
remained
in
complete
loneliness
downstairs
more
melancholy
and
unoccupied
than
ever
he
felt
no
inclination
for
anything
said
he
as
he
went
along
the
passage
he
often
heard
on
the
second
floor
the
voice
of
abbé
faujas
who
spent
whole
afternoons
by
serge
bedside
now
that
he
was
growing
better
is
he
monsieur
mouret
asked
the
priest
timidly
as
he
met
the
latter
going
down
into
the
garden
fairly
well
but
it
will
be
a
long
convalescence
and
very
great
care
will
be
required
the
priest
tranquilly
read
his
breviary
while
the
father
with
a
pair
of
shears
in
his
hand
followed
him
up
and
down
the
garden
walks
trying
to
renew
the
conversation
and
to
get
more
detailed
information
about
his
boy
as
his
son
convalescence
progressed
he
remarked
that
the
priest
scarcely
ever
left
serge
room
he
had
gone
upstairs
several
times
in
the
women
absence
and
he
had
always
found
the
abbé
at
the
young
man
bedside
talking
softly
to
him
and
rendering
him
all
kinds
of
little
services
sweetening
his
drink
straightening
his
or
getting
him
anything
he
happened
to
want
there
was
a
hushed
murmur
throughout
the
house
a
solemn
calm
which
gave
quite
a
conventual
character
to
the
second
floor
mouret
seemed
to
smell
incense
and
could
almost
fancy
sometimes
as
he
heard
a
muttering
of
voices
that
they
were
saying
mass
upstairs
can
they
be
doing
he
wondered
youngster
is
out
of
danger
now
they
ca
be
giving
him
extreme
unction
serge
himself
caused
him
much
disquiet
he
looked
like
a
girl
as
he
lay
in
bed
in
his
white
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
there
was
a
soft
ecstatic
smile
upon
his
lips
which
still
played
there
even
amidst
his
keenest
pangs
of
suffering
mouret
no
longer
ventured
to
say
anything
about
paris
his
dear
sick
boy
seemed
too
girlish
and
tender
for
such
a
journey
one
afternoon
he
went
upstairs
carefully
hushing
the
sound
of
his
steps
the
door
was
ajar
and
he
saw
serge
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
sunshine
the
young
fellow
was
weeping
with
his
eyes
turned
upward
and
his
mother
stood
sobbing
in
front
of
him
they
both
turned
as
they
heard
the
door
open
but
they
did
not
wipe
away
their
tears
as
soon
as
mouret
entered
the
room
the
invalid
said
to
him
in
his
feeble
voice
have
a
favour
to
ask
you
father
mother
says
that
you
will
be
angry
and
will
refuse
me
permission
though
it
would
fill
me
with
joy
i
want
to
enter
the
seminary
he
clasped
his
hands
together
with
a
sort
of
feverish
devotion
you
exclaimed
mouret
he
looked
at
marthe
who
turned
away
her
head
then
saying
nothing
further
he
walked
to
the
window
returned
and
sat
down
mechanically
by
the
bedside
as
though
overwhelmed
by
the
blow
resumed
serge
after
a
long
silence
my
nearness
to
death
i
have
seen
god
and
i
have
sworn
to
be
his
i
assure
you
that
all
my
happiness
is
centred
in
that
believe
me
that
it
is
so
and
do
not
cause
me
grief
mouret
looking
very
mournful
with
his
eyes
lowered
still
kept
silence
at
last
with
an
expression
of
utter
hopelessness
he
murmured
i
had
the
least
particle
of
courage
i
should
wrap
a
couple
of
shirts
in
a
handkerchief
and
go
away
then
he
rose
from
his
seat
went
to
the
window
and
drummed
on
the
panes
with
his
fingers
and
when
serge
again
began
to
implore
him
he
said
very
quietly
well
my
boy
be
a
priest
immediately
afterwards
he
left
the
room
the
next
day
without
the
least
warning
to
anyone
he
set
off
for
marseilles
where
he
spent
a
week
with
his
son
octave
but
he
came
back
looking
careworn
and
aged
octave
had
afforded
him
very
little
consolation
he
had
found
the
young
man
leading
a
fast
life
overwhelmed
with
debts
and
in
all
sorts
of
scrapes
however
mouret
did
not
say
a
word
about
these
matters
he
began
to
lead
a
perfectly
sedentary
existence
and
no
longer
made
any
of
those
good
strokes
of
business
those
fortunate
purchases
of
standing
crops
in
which
he
had
formerly
taken
such
pride
rose
noticed
that
he
maintained
almost
unbroken
silence
and
that
he
even
avoided
saluting
abbé
faujas
you
know
that
you
are
not
very
polite
she
boldly
said
to
him
one
day
reverence
the
curé
has
just
gone
past
and
you
turned
your
back
upon
him
if
you
behave
in
this
way
because
of
the
boy
you
are
under
a
great
mistake
the
curé
was
quite
against
his
going
to
the
seminary
and
i
often
heard
him
talking
to
him
against
it
this
house
is
getting
a
very
cheerful
place
indeed
now
you
never
speak
a
word
even
to
madame
and
when
you
have
your
meals
anyone
would
think
that
it
was
a
funeral
that
was
going
on
for
my
part
sir
i
beginning
to
feel
that
i
had
quite
enough
of
it
mouret
went
out
of
the
room
but
the
cook
followed
him
into
the
garden
you
every
reason
to
be
happy
now
that
your
son
is
on
his
feet
again
he
ate
a
cutlet
yesterday
the
darling
and
with
such
a
good
appetite
too
but
you
care
nothing
about
that
do
you
what
you
want
is
to
make
a
pagan
of
him
like
yourself
ah
you
stand
in
great
need
of
some
one
to
pray
for
you
but
god
almighty
wishes
to
save
us
all
if
i
were
you
i
should
weep
with
joy
to
think
that
that
poor
little
dear
was
going
to
pray
for
me
but
you
are
made
of
stone
sir
and
how
sweet
he
will
look
too
the
darling
in
his
cassock
mouret
thereupon
went
up
to
the
first
floor
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
which
he
called
his
study
a
big
bare
room
furnished
only
with
a
table
and
a
couple
of
chairs
this
room
became
his
refuge
whenever
the
cook
worried
him
when
he
grew
weary
of
staying
there
he
went
down
again
into
the
garden
upon
which
he
expended
greater
care
than
ever
marthe
no
longer
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
her
husband
displeasure
sometimes
he
kept
silent
for
a
week
but
she
was
in
no
way
disquieted
or
distressed
by
it
every
day
she
withdrew
more
and
more
from
her
surroundings
and
she
even
began
to
fancy
now
that
the
house
seemed
so
quiet
and
peaceable
and
she
had
ceased
to
hear
mouret
scolding
that
he
had
grown
more
reasonable
and
had
discovered
for
himself
as
she
had
done
some
little
nook
of
happiness
this
thought
tranquillised
her
and
induced
her
to
plunge
more
deeply
into
her
dreamy
life
when
her
husband
looked
at
her
with
his
blurred
eyes
scarcely
recognising
in
her
the
wife
of
other
days
she
only
smiled
at
him
and
did
not
notice
the
tears
which
were
welling
beneath
his
eyelids
on
the
day
when
serge
now
completely
restored
to
health
entered
the
seminary
mouret
remained
at
home
alone
with
désirée
he
now
frequently
looked
after
her
for
this
big
girl
who
was
nearly
sixteen
might
have
fallen
into
the
basin
of
the
fountain
or
have
set
the
house
on
fire
with
matches
just
like
a
child
of
six
when
marthe
returned
home
she
found
the
doors
open
and
the
rooms
empty
the
house
seemed
quite
deserted
she
went
on
to
the
terrace
and
there
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
walks
she
saw
her
husband
playing
with
his
daughter
he
was
sitting
on
the
gravel
and
with
a
little
wooden
scoop
was
gravely
filling
a
cart
which
désirée
was
pulling
along
with
a
piece
of
string
up
gee
up
cried
the
girl
a
little
said
her
father
patiently
is
not
full
yet
as
you
are
the
horse
you
must
wait
till
the
cart
is
full
then
she
stamped
her
feet
like
an
impatient
horse
and
at
last
not
being
able
to
stand
still
any
longer
she
set
off
with
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
the
cart
fell
over
and
lost
its
load
when
she
had
dragged
it
round
the
garden
she
came
back
to
her
father
crying
it
again
fill
it
again
mouret
loaded
it
again
with
the
little
scoop
for
a
moment
marthe
remained
upon
the
terrace
watching
them
full
of
uneasy
emotion
the
open
doors
the
sight
of
the
man
playing
with
the
child
the
empty
deserted
house
all
touched
her
with
sadness
though
she
was
not
clearly
conscious
of
the
feelings
at
work
in
her
she
went
upstairs
to
take
off
her
things
on
hearing
rose
who
also
had
just
returned
exclaim
from
the
terrace
steps
gracious
how
silly
the
master
is
his
friends
the
retired
traders
with
whom
he
took
a
turn
or
two
every
day
on
the
promenade
in
the
cours
sauvaire
declared
that
he
was
a
little
during
the
last
few
months
his
hair
had
grizzled
he
had
begun
to
get
shaky
on
his
legs
and
was
no
longer
the
biting
jeerer
feared
by
the
whole
town
for
a
little
time
it
was
thought
that
he
had
been
venturing
upon
some
risky
speculations
and
had
been
overcome
by
a
heavy
loss
of
money
madame
paloque
as
she
leaned
over
the
of
her
which
overlooked
the
rue
balande
said
every
time
she
saw
him
that
he
was
certainly
going
to
the
bad
and
if
a
few
moments
later
she
happened
to
catch
sight
of
abbé
faujas
passing
along
the
street
she
took
a
delight
in
exclaiming
the
more
especially
if
she
had
visitors
with
her
look
at
his
reverence
the
curé
is
he
growing
sleek
if
he
eats
out
of
the
same
dish
as
mouret
he
can
leave
him
nothing
but
the
bones
then
she
laughed
as
did
those
who
heard
her
abbé
faujas
was
indeed
becoming
quite
an
imposing
object
he
now
always
wore
black
gloves
and
a
shimmering
cassock
a
peculiar
smile
played
about
his
face
a
sort
of
ironical
twist
of
his
lips
when
madame
de
condamin
complimented
him
upon
his
appearance
the
ladies
liked
to
see
him
nicely
and
comfortably
dressed
though
the
priest
himself
would
probably
have
preferred
fighting
his
way
with
bare
arms
and
clenched
fists
and
never
a
thought
about
what
he
wore
whenever
he
appeared
to
grow
neglectful
of
his
appearance
the
slightest
hint
of
reproach
from
old
madame
rougon
sufficed
to
cure
him
and
he
hurried
off
to
buy
silk
stockings
and
a
new
hat
and
girdle
he
was
frequently
requiring
new
clothes
for
his
big
frame
seemed
to
wear
out
his
garments
very
quickly
since
the
foundation
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
all
the
women
had
been
on
his
side
and
defended
him
against
the
malicious
stories
which
were
still
occasionally
repeated
though
no
one
was
able
to
get
at
their
origin
now
and
then
they
found
him
a
little
blunt
but
this
roughness
of
his
by
no
means
offended
them
least
of
all
in
the
confessional
where
they
rather
liked
to
feel
his
iron
hand
pressing
down
their
necks
gave
me
such
a
scolding
yesterday
my
dear
said
madame
de
condamin
to
marthe
one
day
believe
he
would
have
struck
me
if
there
had
not
been
the
partition
between
us
he
is
not
always
very
easy
to
get
on
with
she
laughed
gently
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
recollection
of
this
scene
with
her
spiritual
director
madame
de
condamin
had
observed
marthe
turn
pale
whenever
she
made
her
certain
confidences
as
to
abbé
faujas
manner
of
hearing
confessions
and
divining
her
jealousy
she
took
a
mischievous
delight
in
tormenting
her
with
which
object
she
gave
her
many
further
private
details
when
abbé
faujas
had
founded
the
young
men
club
he
there
became
quite
sociable
and
gay
in
fact
he
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
transformation
thanks
to
his
will
power
he
moulded
his
stern
nature
like
wax
he
allowed
the
part
which
he
had
taken
in
the
founding
of
the
club
to
be
made
public
and
he
became
the
friend
of
all
the
young
men
in
the
town
keeping
a
strict
watch
over
his
manners
for
he
well
knew
that
young
men
just
fresh
from
college
had
not
the
same
taste
for
roughness
of
speech
and
demeanour
as
the
women
had
he
one
day
narrowly
escaped
losing
his
temper
with
young
rastoil
whose
ears
he
threatened
to
pull
over
a
disagreement
about
the
club
management
but
with
surprising
command
over
himself
he
put
out
his
hand
to
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
humbling
himself
and
winning
over
to
his
side
all
who
were
present
by
his
gracious
apologies
to
big
fool
séverin
as
the
other
was
called
however
although
the
abbé
had
conquered
the
women
and
the
young
men
he
still
remained
on
a
footing
of
mere
formal
politeness
with
the
fathers
and
husbands
the
grave
gentlemen
continued
to
distrust
him
as
they
saw
that
he
still
refrained
from
identifying
himself
with
any
political
party
at
the
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
discussed
him
with
much
animation
while
monsieur
delangre
without
definitely
defending
him
said
with
a
sharp
smile
that
they
ought
to
wait
before
judging
him
at
the
rastoils
he
had
become
a
source
of
much
tribulation
to
the
presiding
judge
whom
séverin
and
his
mother
never
ceased
wearying
with
their
constant
eulogies
of
the
priest
well
let
him
have
every
good
quality
under
the
sun
cried
the
unhappy
man
wo
dispute
one
of
them
only
leave
me
at
peace
i
asked
him
to
dinner
but
he
would
come
i
ca
go
and
drag
him
here
by
force
but
my
dear
said
madame
rastoil
you
meet
him
you
scarcely
bow
to
him
it
that
i
dare
say
that
has
made
him
rather
cold
course
it
is
interposed
séverin
sees
very
well
that
you
are
not
as
polite
to
him
as
you
ought
to
be
monsieur
rastoil
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
monsieur
de
bourdeu
was
there
the
pair
of
them
accused
abbé
faujas
of
leanings
towards
the
though
madame
rastoil
directed
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
never
dined
there
and
had
never
even
set
foot
in
the
house
do
imagine
that
i
accuse
him
of
being
a
bonapartist
said
the
president
only
remarked
that
he
had
leanings
that
way
that
was
all
he
has
had
communications
with
monsieur
delangre
and
so
have
you
cried
séverin
have
had
communications
with
the
mayor
they
are
absolutely
necessary
under
certain
circumstances
tell
the
truth
and
say
you
detest
abbé
faujas
it
would
be
much
more
straightforward
for
whole
days
at
a
time
the
rastoils
sulked
with
one
another
abbé
fenil
came
to
see
them
very
rarely
now
excusing
himself
upon
the
ground
that
he
was
kept
at
home
by
his
gout
but
twice
when
he
had
been
forced
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
curé
of
he
had
said
a
few
words
in
his
praise
abbé
surin
and
abbé
bourrette
as
well
as
monsieur
maffre
held
the
same
views
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
concerning
the
curé
and
the
opposition
to
him
came
only
from
monsieur
rastoil
backed
up
by
monsieur
de
bourdeu
both
of
whom
gravely
declared
that
they
could
not
compromise
their
political
positions
by
receiving
a
man
who
concealed
his
views
séverin
however
now
began
to
knock
at
the
door
in
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
whenever
he
wanted
to
say
anything
to
the
priest
and
gradually
the
little
lane
became
a
sort
of
neutral
ground
doctor
porquier
who
had
been
the
first
to
avail
himself
of
it
young
delangre
and
the
magistrate
all
came
thither
to
talk
to
abbé
faujas
sometimes
the
little
doors
of
both
the
gardens
as
well
as
the
to
the
were
kept
open
for
a
whole
afternoon
while
the
abbé
leant
against
the
wall
smiling
and
shaking
hands
with
those
members
of
the
two
groups
who
wished
to
have
a
word
with
him
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
however
carefully
refrained
from
leaving
the
garden
of
the
and
monsieur
rastoil
and
monsieur
de
bourdeu
equally
persistent
remained
seated
beneath
the
trees
in
front
of
the
former
waterfall
it
was
very
seldom
that
the
priest
little
court
invaded
the
mourets
arbour
now
and
then
a
head
just
peeped
inside
took
a
hasty
glance
around
and
then
quickly
disappeared
abbé
faujas
now
seemed
to
trouble
about
nothing
at
the
most
he
glanced
with
an
expression
of
disquietude
at
the
tronches
windows
through
which
olympe
eyes
were
constantly
glistening
the
trouches
kept
themselves
in
ambush
there
behind
the
red
curtains
full
of
an
envious
desire
to
come
down
like
the
abbé
and
eat
the
fruit
and
talk
to
the
fashionable
folks
they
tapped
on
the
shutters
leant
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
and
then
withdrew
infuriated
by
the
authoritative
glances
of
the
priest
soon
afterwards
however
they
would
return
with
stealthy
steps
press
their
pale
faces
to
one
of
the
panes
and
keep
watch
over
his
every
movement
quite
tortured
to
see
him
enjoying
that
paradise
which
was
forbidden
to
them
is
really
abominable
olympe
exclaimed
one
day
to
her
husband
would
lock
us
up
in
a
cupboard
if
he
could
so
as
to
deprive
us
of
every
atom
of
enjoyment
we
go
down
if
you
like
and
we
see
what
he
says
trouche
had
just
returned
from
his
office
he
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
dusted
his
boots
anxious
to
make
himself
as
neat
as
possible
olympe
put
on
a
light
dress
and
then
they
both
boldly
came
downstairs
into
the
garden
walking
slowly
alongside
the
tall
box
plants
and
stopping
in
front
of
the
at
that
moment
abbé
faujas
happened
to
have
his
back
turned
towards
them
he
was
standing
at
the
little
door
that
opened
into
the
lane
talking
to
monsieur
maffre
when
he
heard
the
trouches
steps
grating
upon
the
gravel
they
were
close
behind
him
under
the
arbour
he
turned
round
and
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
quite
astounded
at
seeing
them
there
monsieur
maffre
who
did
not
know
them
was
looking
at
them
with
curiosity
beautiful
day
is
it
gentlemen
said
olympe
who
had
turned
pale
beneath
her
brother
gaze
the
abbé
abruptly
dragged
the
justice
of
the
peace
into
the
lane
where
he
quickly
got
rid
of
him
is
furious
murmured
olympe
so
much
the
worse
we
had
better
stay
where
we
are
now
if
we
go
back
upstairs
he
will
think
we
are
afraid
of
him
i
had
quite
enough
of
this
kind
of
thing
and
you
will
see
what
i
will
say
to
him
she
made
trouche
seat
himself
on
one
of
the
chairs
which
rose
had
brought
out
a
short
time
previously
and
when
the
abbé
returned
he
found
them
tranquilly
settled
there
he
fastened
the
bolts
of
the
little
door
glanced
quickly
around
to
assure
himself
that
the
trees
screened
them
from
observation
and
then
came
up
close
to
the
trouches
saying
in
a
muffled
voice
forget
our
agreement
you
undertook
to
remain
in
your
own
rooms
was
too
hot
up
there
olympe
replied
are
not
committing
any
crime
by
coming
down
here
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
the
priest
was
on
the
point
of
exploding
but
his
sister
still
quite
pale
from
the
effort
she
had
made
in
resisting
him
added
in
a
peculiar
tone
make
a
noise
now
there
are
some
people
over
there
and
you
might
do
yourself
harm
then
both
the
trouches
laughed
slightly
the
abbé
fixed
his
eyes
upon
them
with
a
terrible
expression
but
without
speaking
down
said
olympe
want
an
explanation
do
you
well
you
shall
have
one
we
are
tired
of
imprisoning
ourselves
you
are
living
here
in
clover
the
house
seems
to
belong
to
you
and
so
does
the
garden
so
much
the
better
indeed
we
are
delighted
to
see
how
well
things
appear
to
be
going
with
you
but
you
must
treat
us
as
dirt
beneath
your
feet
you
have
never
thought
of
bringing
me
up
a
single
bunch
of
grapes
you
have
given
us
the
most
wretched
of
the
rooms
you
hide
us
away
and
are
ashamed
of
us
you
shut
us
up
as
though
we
had
the
plague
you
must
understand
that
it
ca
go
on
any
longer
am
not
the
master
here
replied
abbé
faujas
must
address
yourselves
to
monsieur
mouret
if
you
want
to
strip
his
garden
the
trouches
exchanged
a
fresh
smile
do
want
to
pry
into
your
affairs
olympe
continued
know
what
we
know
and
that
is
sufficient
for
us
but
all
this
proves
what
a
bad
heart
you
have
do
you
think
that
if
we
were
in
your
position
we
should
invite
you
to
come
and
take
your
share
in
the
good
things
that
were
going
is
it
that
you
want
me
to
do
demanded
the
abbé
you
suppose
that
i
am
rolling
in
wealth
you
know
what
sort
of
a
room
i
occupy
myself
it
is
more
scantily
furnished
than
your
own
the
house
mine
and
i
ca
give
it
you
olympe
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
silenced
her
husband
who
was
beginning
to
speak
and
then
calmly
continued
has
his
own
ideas
of
life
if
you
had
millions
you
buy
a
strip
of
carpet
for
your
bedside
you
would
spend
them
all
in
some
foolish
scheme
or
other
we
on
the
other
hand
like
to
be
comfortable
dare
you
say
that
if
you
had
a
fancy
for
the
handsomest
furniture
in
the
house
and
for
the
linen
and
food
and
anything
else
it
contains
you
could
have
them
this
very
evening
well
in
such
circumstances
a
good
brother
would
think
of
his
relations
and
leave
them
in
wretchedness
and
squalor
as
you
leave
us
abbé
faujas
looked
keenly
at
the
trouches
they
were
both
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
on
their
chairs
are
a
pair
of
ungrateful
people
he
said
after
a
silence
have
already
done
a
great
deal
for
you
you
have
me
to
thank
for
the
food
that
you
eat
now
i
still
have
letters
of
yours
olympe
letters
in
which
you
beseech
me
to
rescue
you
from
your
misery
by
bringing
you
over
to
plassans
now
that
you
are
here
and
your
livelihood
is
assured
you
break
out
into
fresh
demands
trouche
impudently
interrupted
sent
for
us
here
because
you
wanted
us
i
have
learned
to
my
cost
not
to
believe
in
fine
talk
i
have
allowed
my
wife
to
speak
but
women
can
never
come
to
the
point
in
two
words
my
good
friend
you
are
making
a
mistake
in
keeping
us
cooped
up
like
dogs
who
are
only
brought
out
in
the
hour
of
danger
we
are
getting
weary
of
it
and
we
shall
perhaps
end
by
doing
something
foolish
confound
it
all
give
us
a
little
liberty
since
the
house
is
yours
and
you
despise
all
luxury
what
harm
can
it
do
you
if
we
make
ourselves
comfortable
we
sha
eat
the
walls
course
exclaimed
olympe
only
natural
that
we
should
rebel
against
being
constantly
locked
up
we
will
take
care
to
do
nothing
to
prejudice
you
you
know
that
my
husband
only
requires
the
least
sign
from
you
go
your
own
way
and
you
may
depend
upon
us
but
let
us
go
ours
is
that
understood
eh
abbé
faujas
had
bent
his
head
he
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
raising
his
eyes
and
avoiding
a
direct
reply
he
said
to
what
i
say
if
ever
you
do
anything
to
hamper
me
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
send
you
away
to
starve
in
a
garret
on
the
straw
then
he
went
back
into
the
house
leaving
them
under
the
arbour
from
that
time
the
trouches
went
down
into
the
garden
almost
every
day
but
they
conducted
themselves
with
considerable
discretion
and
refrained
from
going
there
at
the
times
when
the
priest
was
talking
with
the
guests
from
the
neighbouring
gardens
the
following
week
olympe
complained
so
much
of
the
room
she
was
occupying
that
marthe
kindly
offered
her
serge
which
was
now
at
liberty
the
trouches
then
kept
both
rooms
they
slept
in
the
young
man
old
bedchamber
from
which
not
a
single
article
of
furniture
had
been
removed
and
turned
the
other
apartment
into
a
sort
of
for
which
rose
found
them
some
old
furniture
in
the
olympe
in
great
delight
ordered
a
from
the
best
maker
in
plassans
mouret
who
had
forgotten
that
marthe
had
asked
his
permission
to
let
the
trouches
have
serge
room
was
quite
surprised
to
find
them
there
one
evening
he
had
gone
up
to
look
for
a
knife
which
he
thought
his
son
must
have
left
in
one
of
the
drawers
and
as
he
entered
the
room
he
saw
trouche
trimming
with
this
very
knife
a
switch
which
he
had
just
cut
from
one
of
the
in
the
garden
thereupon
he
apologised
and
went
downstairs
xiv
during
the
public
procession
on
the
feast
of
corpus
christi
when
monseigneur
rousselot
came
down
the
steps
of
the
magnificent
altar
set
up
through
the
generosity
of
madame
de
condamin
on
the
place
of
the
close
to
the
very
door
of
the
small
house
she
occupied
it
was
noticed
with
much
surprise
by
the
spectators
that
the
bishop
abruptly
turned
his
back
upon
abbé
faujas
has
there
been
some
disagreement
between
them
exclaimed
madame
rougon
who
was
looking
out
of
her
window
you
know
about
it
asked
madame
paloque
who
was
leaning
over
by
the
old
lady
side
has
been
the
talk
of
the
town
since
yesterday
abbé
fenil
has
been
restored
to
favour
monsieur
de
condamin
who
was
standing
behind
the
ladies
began
to
laugh
he
had
made
his
escape
from
his
own
house
saying
that
it
smelt
like
a
church
you
attach
any
importance
to
such
trifles
said
he
bishop
is
merely
an
old
weathercock
turning
one
way
or
the
other
according
as
faujas
or
fenil
blows
against
him
it
is
one
of
them
it
will
be
the
other
they
have
quarrelled
and
made
it
up
again
half
a
score
times
already
before
three
days
are
over
you
will
see
that
faujas
will
be
the
pet
again
do
believe
it
exclaimed
madame
paloque
is
serious
this
time
it
seems
that
abbé
faujas
has
caused
his
lordship
a
great
deal
of
worry
it
appears
that
he
formerly
preached
some
sermons
which
excited
great
displeasure
at
rome
i
ca
explain
the
matter
quite
clearly
but
i
know
that
the
bishop
has
received
reproachful
letters
from
rome
in
which
he
is
recommended
to
be
on
his
guard
it
is
said
that
abbé
faujas
is
simply
a
political
agent
says
so
asked
madame
rougon
blinking
her
eyes
as
though
to
see
the
procession
which
was
then
passing
through
the
rue
de
la
banne
more
distinctly
heard
it
said
but
i
really
do
remember
by
whom
the
wife
replied
carelessly
then
she
retired
saying
that
one
would
be
able
to
get
a
better
view
from
the
monsieur
de
condamin
however
took
the
vacant
place
by
madame
rougon
and
whispered
in
the
old
lady
ear
have
already
twice
seen
her
going
to
abbé
fenil
they
have
some
plot
or
other
in
hand
i
sure
abbé
faujas
must
have
trodden
somehow
or
other
on
that
viper
of
a
woman
and
she
trying
to
bite
him
if
she
were
not
so
ugly
i
would
do
her
the
service
of
telling
her
that
her
husband
will
never
be
presiding
judge
i
do
understand
murmured
the
old
lady
with
a
guileless
expression
monsieur
de
condamin
looked
at
her
curiously
and
then
began
to
smile
the
last
two
gendarmes
in
the
procession
had
just
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
cours
sauvaire
and
the
few
guests
whom
madame
rougon
had
invited
to
witness
the
blessing
of
the
altar
returned
into
the
where
they
chatted
for
a
moment
about
the
graciousness
and
the
new
banners
of
the
different
congregations
and
especially
the
one
belonging
to
the
girls
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
which
had
attracted
much
attention
the
ladies
were
loud
in
their
praises
and
abbé
faujas
name
was
mentioned
every
moment
in
the
most
eulogistic
terms
is
clearly
a
saint
sniggered
madame
paloque
to
monsieur
de
condamin
who
had
taken
a
seat
near
her
then
bending
forward
towards
him
she
added
could
not
speak
openly
before
madame
rougon
you
know
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
abbé
faujas
and
madame
mouret
i
dare
say
those
unpleasant
reports
have
reached
the
bishop
ears
mouret
is
a
charming
woman
and
extremely
winning
notwithstanding
her
forty
years
was
all
that
monsieur
de
condamin
said
in
reply
yes
she
is
very
charming
very
charming
indeed
murmured
madame
paloque
whose
face
turned
quite
green
with
spleen
charming
persisted
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
is
at
the
age
of
genuine
passion
and
great
happiness
you
ladies
are
given
to
judging
each
other
unfavourably
thereupon
he
left
the
chuckling
over
madame
suppressed
rage
the
town
was
now
indeed
taking
an
absorbing
interest
in
the
continual
struggle
that
went
on
between
abbé
faujas
and
abbé
fenil
for
influence
over
the
bishop
it
was
a
ceaseless
combat
like
the
struggles
of
a
couple
of
buxom
housekeepers
for
the
affection
of
an
old
dotard
the
bishop
smiled
knowingly
he
had
discovered
how
to
maintain
a
kind
of
equilibrium
between
these
opposing
forces
which
he
pitted
one
against
the
other
amused
at
seeing
them
overthrown
in
turn
and
securing
peace
for
himself
by
accepting
the
services
of
the
one
who
temporarily
gained
the
upper
hand
to
the
dreadful
stories
which
were
told
him
to
the
detriment
of
his
favourites
he
paid
but
little
attention
for
he
knew
that
the
rival
abbés
were
capable
of
accusing
each
other
of
murder
are
getting
worse
my
child
the
bishop
said
in
one
of
his
expansive
moments
to
abbé
surin
fancy
that
in
the
end
paris
will
carry
the
day
and
rome
will
get
the
worst
of
it
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
and
i
shall
leave
them
to
wear
each
other
out
when
one
has
made
an
end
of
the
other
things
will
be
settled
by
the
way
just
read
me
the
third
ode
of
horace
i
afraid
i
translated
one
of
the
lines
rather
badly
on
the
tuesday
after
the
public
procession
the
weather
was
lovely
laughter
was
heard
both
in
the
garden
of
the
rastoils
and
in
that
of
the
and
numerous
guests
were
sitting
under
the
trees
abbé
faujas
read
his
breviary
in
the
mourets
garden
after
his
usual
custom
while
slowly
walking
up
and
down
beside
the
tall
hedges
of
box
for
some
days
past
he
had
kept
the
little
door
that
led
to
the
lane
bolted
he
was
indeed
coquetting
with
his
neighbours
and
keeping
aloof
in
order
that
he
might
make
them
more
anxious
to
see
him
possibly
too
he
had
noticed
a
slight
coldness
in
their
manner
after
his
last
misunderstanding
with
the
bishop
and
the
abominable
reports
that
his
enemies
had
circulated
against
him
about
five
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
abbé
surin
proposed
a
game
of
shuttlecock
to
monsieur
rastoil
daughters
he
was
very
clever
at
it
himself
and
notwithstanding
the
approach
of
their
thirtieth
year
both
angéline
and
aurélie
were
immensely
fond
of
games
when
the
servant
brought
the
battledores
abbé
surin
looking
about
him
for
a
shady
spot
for
the
garden
was
still
bright
with
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
was
struck
with
an
idea
of
which
the
young
ladies
cordially
approved
we
go
and
play
in
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
he
asked
shall
be
shaded
by
the
there
and
have
more
room
they
left
the
garden
and
started
a
most
delightful
game
in
the
lane
the
two
girls
began
and
angéline
was
the
first
who
failed
to
keep
the
shuttlecock
going
abbé
surin
who
took
her
place
handed
his
battledore
with
professional
skill
and
ease
having
tucked
his
cassock
between
his
legs
he
sprang
backwards
and
forwards
and
sideways
without
cessation
his
battledore
caught
the
shuttlecock
as
it
reached
the
ground
and
sent
it
flying
now
to
a
surprising
height
and
now
straight
ahead
like
a
bullet
and
at
times
made
it
describe
the
most
graceful
curves
as
a
rule
he
preferred
to
be
pitted
against
poor
players
who
as
they
struck
the
shuttlecock
at
random
or
to
use
his
own
phrase
without
any
rhythm
brought
all
the
skilful
agility
of
his
own
play
into
exercise
mademoiselle
aurélie
however
played
a
fair
game
she
vented
a
little
cry
like
a
swallow
every
time
she
struck
a
blow
with
the
battledore
and
she
laughed
distractedly
when
the
shuttlecock
alighted
on
the
young
abbé
nose
gathering
up
her
skirts
she
waited
for
its
return
or
leaped
backward
with
a
great
rustling
of
petticoats
when
he
vengefully
gave
it
a
smarter
blow
than
usual
at
last
the
shuttlecock
fell
into
her
hair
and
she
almost
toppled
over
upon
her
back
this
greatly
amused
them
all
angéline
now
took
her
place
and
every
time
that
abbé
faujas
raised
his
eyes
from
his
breviary
as
he
paced
the
mourets
garden
he
saw
the
white
feathers
of
the
shuttlecock
skimming
above
the
wall
like
a
big
butterfly
you
there
your
reverence
all
at
once
cried
angéline
at
the
little
door
shuttlecock
has
fallen
into
your
garden
the
abbé
picked
up
the
shuttlecock
which
had
dropped
at
his
feet
and
made
up
his
mind
to
open
the
door
thank
you
your
reverence
said
aurélie
who
had
already
taken
the
battledore
angéline
would
ever
make
such
a
stroke
the
other
day
when
papa
was
watching
us
she
sent
the
shuttlecock
right
against
his
ear
with
such
a
bang
that
he
was
quite
deaf
till
the
next
day
there
was
more
laughter
at
this
and
abbé
surin
as
rosy
as
a
girl
delicately
dabbed
his
brow
with
a
handkerchief
of
fine
texture
he
pushed
his
fair
hair
behind
his
ears
and
stood
there
with
glistening
eyes
and
flexible
figure
using
his
battledore
as
a
fan
in
the
excitement
of
the
game
his
bands
had
got
slightly
displaced
le
curé
said
he
as
he
took
up
his
position
again
shall
be
umpire
abbé
faujas
holding
his
breviary
under
his
arm
and
smiling
paternally
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
doorway
through
the
of
the
which
was
half
open
he
could
see
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
seated
in
front
of
the
cascade
amidst
his
friends
the
priest
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
however
and
counted
the
points
of
the
game
while
complimenting
abbé
surin
and
consoling
the
young
ladies
tell
you
what
péqueur
said
monsieur
de
condamin
in
a
whisper
in
the
ear
make
a
mistake
in
not
inviting
that
little
abbé
to
your
parties
he
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
ladies
and
he
looks
as
though
he
could
waltz
to
perfection
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
who
was
talking
to
monsieur
delangre
with
much
animation
did
not
however
appear
to
hear
the
other
but
went
on
with
his
conversation
with
the
mayor
my
dear
sir
he
said
do
know
where
you
see
all
the
merits
that
you
profess
to
find
in
him
on
the
contrary
indeed
abbé
faujas
appears
to
me
to
be
of
very
doubtful
character
there
is
considerable
suspicion
attached
to
his
past
career
and
strange
things
are
said
about
him
here
i
really
do
see
why
i
should
go
down
on
my
knees
to
this
priest
especially
as
the
clergy
of
plassans
are
hostile
to
us
i
should
gain
no
advantage
by
doing
so
monsieur
delangre
and
monsieur
de
condamin
exchanged
glances
of
intelligence
and
then
by
way
of
reply
nodded
their
heads
whatever
continued
the
is
no
use
pretending
to
look
mysterious
i
may
tell
you
that
i
have
myself
written
to
paris
i
was
a
good
deal
bothered
and
i
wanted
to
be
quite
certain
about
this
faujas
whom
you
seem
to
look
upon
as
a
sort
of
prince
in
disguise
well
do
you
know
what
reply
i
got
they
told
me
that
they
did
not
know
him
and
could
tell
me
nothing
about
him
and
that
i
must
carefully
avoid
mixing
myself
up
with
clerical
matters
they
are
grumpy
enough
in
paris
as
it
is
since
the
election
of
that
jackass
lagrifoul
and
i
have
to
be
prudent
you
understand
the
mayor
exchanged
another
glance
with
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
he
even
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
before
the
correctly
twirled
moustaches
of
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
listen
to
me
he
said
to
him
after
a
moment
silence
would
like
to
be
a
prefect
would
you
the
smiled
as
he
rocked
himself
in
his
chair
then
go
at
once
and
shake
hands
with
abbé
faujas
who
is
waiting
for
you
down
there
while
he
is
watching
them
play
at
shuttlecock
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
was
silent
with
astonishment
he
seemed
quite
puzzled
turned
towards
monsieur
de
condamin
and
asked
with
some
show
of
uneasiness
that
your
advice
also
go
and
offer
him
your
hand
replied
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
then
with
a
slight
touch
of
irony
he
added
my
wife
if
you
like
i
know
you
have
perfect
confidence
in
her
madame
de
condamin
was
just
approaching
them
she
was
wearing
a
lovely
pink
and
dress
when
they
spoke
to
her
of
the
abbé
she
said
graciously
to
the
is
very
wrong
of
you
to
neglect
your
religious
duties
one
never
sees
you
at
church
except
perhaps
when
there
is
some
official
ceremony
it
really
distresses
me
very
much
and
i
must
try
to
convert
you
what
sort
of
opinion
do
you
expect
people
will
have
of
the
government
you
represent
if
they
see
you
are
not
on
the
side
of
religion
leave
us
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
confess
monsieur
péqueur
she
took
a
seat
smiling
playfully
said
the
in
an
undertone
when
they
were
alone
together
make
fun
of
me
you
were
a
very
pious
person
in
the
rue
du
helder
in
paris
it
all
i
can
do
to
keep
from
laughing
when
i
see
you
worshipping
in
are
too
flippant
my
friend
she
replied
your
flippancy
will
play
you
a
bad
turn
one
of
these
days
seriously
you
quite
distress
me
i
gave
you
credit
for
having
more
intelligence
are
you
so
blind
that
you
can
not
see
that
you
are
tottering
in
your
position
let
me
tell
you
that
it
is
only
from
fear
of
alarming
the
legitimists
at
plassans
that
you
have
already
been
recalled
if
the
legitimists
saw
a
new
arriving
here
they
would
take
alarm
whereas
so
long
as
you
remain
here
they
will
continue
quietly
sleeping
feeling
certain
of
victory
at
the
next
election
all
this
is
not
very
flattering
for
you
i
am
aware
of
that
and
the
more
so
as
i
know
positively
that
the
authorities
are
acting
without
taking
you
into
their
confidence
listen
to
me
my
friend
i
tell
you
that
you
are
ruined
if
you
do
divine
certain
things
he
looked
at
her
with
unfeigned
alarm
the
great
man
been
writing
to
you
he
asked
referring
to
a
personage
whom
they
thus
designated
between
themselves
he
has
broken
entirely
with
me
i
am
not
a
fool
and
i
saw
before
he
did
the
necessity
of
the
separation
and
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
complain
of
he
has
shown
me
the
greatest
kindness
he
found
me
a
husband
and
gave
me
some
excellent
advice
which
has
proved
extremely
useful
to
me
but
i
have
retained
friends
in
paris
and
i
swear
to
you
that
you
have
only
just
got
time
left
to
cling
on
to
the
branches
if
you
do
want
to
fall
do
be
a
pagan
any
longer
but
go
and
offer
your
hand
to
abbé
faujas
you
will
understand
why
later
on
even
if
you
ca
guess
it
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
lowered
his
eyes
and
seemed
a
little
humiliated
by
the
lesson
he
was
receiving
he
was
very
conceited
and
showing
his
white
teeth
he
tried
to
himself
by
murmuring
tenderly
if
you
had
only
been
willing
octavie
we
might
have
governed
plassans
between
us
i
asked
you
to
resume
that
delightful
life
now
you
are
a
great
idiot
she
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
vexation
annoy
me
with
your
octavie
i
am
madame
de
condamin
to
everyone
my
friend
ca
you
understand
anything
i
have
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
i
am
queen
of
a
whole
i
go
everywhere
i
am
respected
everywhere
bowed
to
and
liked
what
in
the
world
should
i
do
with
you
you
would
only
inconvenience
me
i
am
a
respectable
woman
my
friend
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
walked
towards
doctor
porquier
who
according
to
his
custom
had
come
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
garden
chatting
to
his
fair
patients
after
a
round
of
visits
doctor
she
exclaimed
with
one
of
her
pretty
grimaces
have
got
such
a
headache
it
pains
me
just
here
under
the
left
eyebrow
is
the
side
of
the
heart
madame
said
the
doctor
gallantly
madame
de
condamin
smiled
and
did
not
carry
the
consultation
any
further
madame
paloque
who
was
present
bent
however
towards
her
husband
whom
she
brought
with
her
every
time
she
came
in
order
that
she
might
recommend
him
to
the
influence
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
only
way
porquier
has
of
curing
them
when
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
had
joined
monsieur
de
condamin
and
monsieur
delangre
he
manœuvred
cleverly
in
such
wise
as
to
draw
them
towards
the
gateway
when
he
was
within
a
few
yards
of
it
he
stopped
and
appeared
to
be
interested
in
the
game
of
shuttlecock
which
was
still
going
on
in
the
lane
abbé
surin
with
his
hair
blown
about
by
the
wind
the
sleeves
of
his
cassock
rolled
up
and
his
slender
white
womanly
wrists
displayed
had
just
stepped
backwards
putting
some
twenty
yards
between
himself
and
mademoiselle
aurélie
he
felt
that
he
was
being
watched
and
he
quite
surpassed
himself
mademoiselle
aurélie
was
also
playing
extremely
well
spurred
on
as
it
were
by
the
skill
of
her
partner
thus
the
shuttlecock
described
long
gentle
curves
with
such
regularity
that
it
seemed
to
light
of
its
own
accord
upon
the
battledores
going
from
one
to
the
other
player
without
either
of
them
having
to
stir
from
their
places
abbé
surin
inclined
slightly
backwards
displayed
his
bust
to
advantage
excellent
cried
the
monsieur
i
must
compliment
you
upon
your
skill
then
turning
towards
madame
de
condamin
doctor
porquier
and
the
paloques
he
exclaimed
really
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
you
will
allow
us
to
admire
your
play
i
hope
monsieur
the
whole
set
of
the
now
formed
into
a
group
at
the
far
end
of
the
lane
abbé
faujas
had
not
moved
from
the
position
he
had
taken
up
having
acknowledged
with
a
nod
the
salutations
of
monsieur
delangre
and
monsieur
de
condamin
he
went
on
counting
the
points
of
the
game
when
aurélie
at
last
missed
the
shuttlecock
he
said
makes
you
three
hundred
and
ten
points
for
the
distance
was
altered
your
sister
has
only
however
while
he
appeared
to
follow
the
flight
of
the
shuttlecock
with
interest
he
every
now
and
then
glanced
at
the
door
of
the
rastoils
garden
which
still
remained
open
monsieur
maffre
was
as
yet
the
only
person
who
had
shown
himself
there
but
at
last
a
voice
called
from
inside
the
garden
is
amusing
them
so
much
out
there
it
was
monsieur
rastoil
who
was
chatting
with
monsieur
de
bourdeu
beside
the
rustic
table
that
asked
the
question
lordship
secretary
is
playing
at
shuttlecock
monsieur
maffre
replied
is
making
some
wonderful
strokes
and
everybody
is
watching
him
his
reverence
the
curé
is
there
and
seems
quite
amazed
monsieur
de
bourdeu
took
a
big
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
exclaimed
monsieur
faujas
is
there
is
he
he
glanced
at
monsieur
rastoil
and
they
both
seemed
ill
at
ease
have
heard
remarked
the
presiding
judge
the
curé
has
been
restored
to
the
bishop
favour
indeed
this
very
morning
said
monsieur
maffre
has
been
a
complete
reconciliation
and
i
have
heard
some
touching
particulars
about
it
his
lordship
shed
tears
ah
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
abbé
fenil
has
cause
for
thought
that
you
were
the
friend
observed
monsieur
de
bourdeu
i
am
but
i
am
also
the
curé
friend
replied
the
justice
of
the
peace
goodness
he
is
a
man
of
sufficient
piety
to
be
able
to
despise
all
the
calumnies
of
his
enemies
they
have
even
hesitated
to
question
his
morality
it
is
disgraceful
the
again
glanced
at
the
presiding
judge
with
a
singular
expression
they
tried
to
compromise
him
in
political
matters
continued
monsieur
maffre
said
that
he
had
come
here
to
overturn
everything
to
bestow
places
right
and
left
and
bring
about
the
triumph
of
the
paris
clique
why
if
he
had
been
the
chief
of
a
band
of
brigands
folks
could
have
said
worse
things
about
him
than
they
have
done
a
pack
of
lies
all
of
them
monsieur
de
bourdeu
was
drawing
a
face
on
the
gravel
of
the
walk
with
the
tip
of
his
he
said
carelessly
have
heard
these
things
mentioned
but
it
is
very
unlikely
that
a
minister
of
religion
would
allow
himself
to
play
such
a
part
and
besides
to
the
honour
of
plassans
i
think
it
may
be
said
that
he
would
have
failed
completely
there
is
no
one
here
who
could
be
bought
it
all
stuff
and
nonsense
that
cried
the
presiding
judge
shrugging
his
shoulders
town
ca
be
turned
inside
out
like
an
old
coat
paris
may
send
us
as
many
spies
and
agents
as
she
likes
but
plassans
will
always
keep
legitimist
look
at
that
little
péqueur
now
we
only
made
a
single
mouthful
of
him
folks
must
be
very
stupid
to
believe
in
mysterious
personages
running
about
the
provinces
offering
places
and
appointments
i
should
be
very
curious
to
see
one
of
those
gentlemen
he
seemed
to
be
getting
a
little
angry
and
monsieur
maffre
with
some
show
of
uneasiness
appeared
to
think
it
necessary
to
defend
himself
me
he
exclaimed
have
never
asserted
that
abbé
faujas
was
a
bonapartist
agent
on
the
contrary
i
have
always
considered
the
accusation
a
most
absurd
one
it
not
a
question
of
abbé
faujas
my
remarks
are
quite
general
people
do
sell
themselves
in
that
way
abbé
faujas
is
above
all
suspicion
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
monsieur
de
bourdeu
finished
the
face
he
was
drawing
on
the
gravel
by
adding
a
long
pointed
beard
to
it
faujas
has
no
political
views
he
at
last
said
in
his
dry
voice
replied
monsieur
rastoil
found
fault
with
him
for
his
indifference
but
now
i
approve
of
it
with
all
this
gossip
in
the
air
it
would
have
had
a
prejudicial
effect
upon
religion
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
bourdeu
that
he
ca
be
accused
of
the
slightest
suspicious
step
he
has
never
been
seen
at
the
has
he
he
kept
with
great
propriety
in
his
fitting
place
if
he
were
a
bonapartist
he
would
be
likely
to
conceal
it
would
he
not
too
he
leads
a
most
exemplary
life
my
wife
and
my
son
have
told
me
things
about
him
which
have
affected
me
very
much
the
merriment
in
the
little
lane
was
now
louder
than
ever
abbé
faujas
could
be
heard
complimenting
mademoiselle
aurélie
on
some
wonderful
stroke
of
her
battledore
monsieur
rastoil
who
had
checked
himself
for
a
moment
continued
with
a
smile
listen
to
them
what
can
they
find
in
it
to
amuse
them
so
much
it
makes
one
quite
long
to
be
young
again
then
in
a
more
serious
tone
he
added
my
wife
and
my
son
have
made
me
feel
a
strong
liking
for
abbé
faujas
and
we
are
very
sorry
that
his
discreet
reserve
keeps
him
from
joining
our
circle
as
monsieur
bourdeu
nodded
his
head
approvingly
shouts
of
applause
were
heard
in
the
alley
there
was
a
perfect
uproar
of
laughter
and
shouts
as
though
some
troop
of
had
just
rushed
out
to
play
monsieur
rastoil
rose
from
his
rustic
chair
gracious
he
said
with
a
smile
us
go
and
see
what
they
are
up
to
my
legs
are
beginning
to
feel
a
little
cramped
the
others
followed
him
and
they
all
three
went
and
stood
by
the
little
door
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
presiding
judge
and
the
had
ventured
so
far
when
they
saw
the
group
formed
by
the
guests
at
the
end
of
the
lane
their
faces
assumed
a
serious
expression
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
for
his
part
drew
himself
up
and
put
on
an
official
attitude
madame
de
condamin
went
flitting
to
and
fro
along
the
lane
laughing
and
smiling
and
filling
the
place
with
the
rustle
of
her
pink
and
grey
dress
the
two
sets
of
guests
kept
glancing
at
one
another
neither
being
willing
to
retire
while
abbé
faujas
still
maintained
his
position
between
them
at
mouret
door
quietly
enjoying
himself
without
seeming
in
the
least
degree
conscious
of
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
all
the
spectators
held
their
breath
for
abbé
surin
seeing
that
their
number
had
increased
was
desirous
of
winning
their
applause
by
a
last
exhibition
of
skill
he
brought
all
his
science
into
play
created
difficulties
for
himself
on
purpose
to
overcome
them
turned
round
and
struck
at
the
shuttlecock
without
looking
at
it
but
seemingly
divining
its
position
and
thus
sending
it
back
over
his
head
to
mademoiselle
aurélie
with
mathematical
precision
he
was
very
much
flushed
and
was
perspiring
freely
he
had
thrown
his
hat
off
and
his
bands
were
now
hanging
over
his
right
shoulder
but
he
was
the
victor
and
he
looked
as
he
always
did
amiable
and
charming
the
two
groups
of
guests
lingered
there
admiring
him
and
madame
de
condamin
had
to
repress
the
applause
which
burst
out
prematurely
and
inopportunely
by
shaking
her
lace
handkerchief
then
the
young
abbé
introducing
still
further
refinements
into
his
play
began
to
skip
about
first
to
right
and
then
to
left
each
time
receiving
the
shuttlecock
in
a
fresh
position
this
was
the
grand
final
flourish
he
accelerated
the
rapidity
of
his
play
and
at
last
just
as
he
was
jumping
aside
his
foot
slipped
and
he
nearly
fell
upon
the
bosom
of
madame
de
condamin
who
had
stretched
out
her
arms
with
a
little
cry
the
spectators
thinking
he
was
hurt
rushed
up
but
the
abbé
who
was
pressing
the
ground
with
his
hands
and
knees
sprang
up
again
by
a
strong
effort
and
sent
the
shuttlecock
which
had
not
yet
fallen
spinning
back
to
mademoiselle
aurélie
then
flourishing
his
battledore
he
triumphed
bravo
cried
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
stepping
up
to
him
it
was
a
magnificent
stroke
exclaimed
monsieur
rastoil
who
also
came
up
the
game
was
interrupted
for
the
two
sets
of
guests
had
now
invaded
the
lane
and
were
mingled
with
each
other
crowding
around
abbé
surin
who
leant
quite
out
of
breath
against
the
wall
by
abbé
side
everybody
began
talking
at
once
was
afraid
that
he
had
split
his
skull
said
doctor
porquier
to
monsieur
maffre
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
these
games
generally
have
a
bad
ending
remarked
monsieur
de
bourdeu
addressing
himself
to
monsieur
delangre
and
the
paloques
while
he
received
a
shake
of
the
hand
from
monsieur
de
condamin
whom
he
always
tried
to
avoid
in
the
streets
so
that
he
might
not
have
to
bow
to
him
madame
de
condamin
went
from
the
to
the
presiding
judge
bringing
them
face
to
face
and
exclaiming
really
i
am
more
upset
than
he
is
i
thought
that
we
were
going
to
fall
together
there
is
a
big
stone
there
did
you
notice
it
i
see
it
there
said
monsieur
rastoil
must
have
caught
against
his
heel
it
this
round
stone
do
you
think
asked
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
picking
up
a
pebble
they
had
never
spoken
to
each
other
before
except
at
official
ceremonies
now
however
they
began
to
examine
the
stone
and
passed
it
from
one
to
the
other
remarking
that
it
was
very
sharp
and
must
have
cut
the
abbé
shoe
madame
de
condamin
stood
smiling
between
them
and
assured
them
that
she
was
beginning
to
feel
better
the
abbé
is
feeling
ill
suddenly
cried
monsieur
daughters
abbé
surin
had
indeed
turned
very
pale
at
hearing
of
the
danger
he
had
run
he
was
reeling
with
faintness
when
abbé
faujas
who
had
kept
aloof
took
him
in
his
powerful
arms
and
carried
him
into
garden
where
he
seated
him
upon
a
chair
the
two
sets
of
guests
soon
swarmed
into
the
arbour
where
the
young
abbé
completely
fainted
away
some
water
and
some
vinegar
rose
cried
abbé
faujas
running
towards
the
steps
mouret
who
was
in
the
came
to
the
window
but
on
seeing
all
those
people
in
his
garden
he
recoiled
as
though
he
were
struck
with
fear
and
kept
himself
out
of
sight
rose
soon
came
up
with
a
collection
of
drugs
muttering
as
she
hastened
along
only
madame
were
here
but
she
has
gone
to
the
seminary
to
see
the
lad
i
am
all
alone
and
i
ca
do
impossibilities
can
i
the
master
wo
stir
an
inch
anybody
might
die
for
all
he
cared
there
he
is
in
the
hiding
himself
he
would
let
you
die
before
he
would
get
you
even
a
glass
of
water
by
the
time
she
had
got
through
this
grumble
she
had
reached
abbé
surin
who
was
lying
in
a
swoon
the
cherub
she
exclaimed
overcome
with
womanly
pity
the
young
abbé
with
his
closed
eyes
and
his
pale
brow
wreathed
with
long
fair
hair
looked
like
one
of
the
martyrs
that
one
sees
expiring
in
sacred
pictures
the
elder
of
the
rastoil
girls
was
supporting
his
head
which
lay
back
allowing
his
delicate
white
neck
to
be
seen
they
were
all
in
great
excitement
over
him
madame
de
condamin
gently
dabbed
his
brow
with
a
rag
soaked
in
vinegar
and
water
and
the
others
stood
anxiously
looking
at
her
at
last
the
young
abbé
opened
his
eyes
but
closed
them
again
immediately
he
had
two
more
swoons
before
he
recovered
have
given
me
a
terrible
fright
at
last
said
doctor
porquier
who
had
kept
his
hand
fast
in
his
own
abbé
surin
still
sitting
on
the
chair
stammered
out
confused
thanks
and
assured
them
all
that
it
was
a
mere
nothing
then
he
saw
that
his
cassock
had
been
unbuttoned
and
he
smiled
as
he
buttoned
it
and
readjusted
his
bands
to
prove
that
he
was
all
right
again
when
the
company
advised
him
to
keep
quiet
he
went
back
to
the
lane
with
the
rastoil
girls
in
order
to
finish
the
game
have
a
very
nice
place
here
said
monsieur
rastoil
to
abbé
faujas
whose
side
he
had
not
quitted
air
on
this
slope
is
delightful
added
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
in
his
charming
manner
then
both
sets
of
guests
began
looking
with
curiosity
at
mouret
house
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
would
like
to
stay
in
the
garden
a
little
while
exclaimed
rose
will
go
and
get
some
chairs
she
made
three
journeys
in
quest
of
them
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
the
company
then
after
glancing
at
each
other
for
a
moment
the
two
sets
of
guests
felt
constrained
by
courtesy
to
seat
themselves
the
installed
himself
on
abbé
faujas
right
hand
while
the
presiding
judge
took
a
chair
on
his
left
and
a
friendly
conversation
at
once
began
are
a
very
quiet
neighbour
monsieur
le
curé
said
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
very
graciously
ca
imagine
what
pleasure
it
gives
me
to
see
you
every
day
at
the
same
hour
in
this
little
paradise
it
seems
to
bring
me
a
feeling
of
restfulness
after
all
the
noise
and
worry
i
have
pleasant
neighbour
is
a
very
rare
thing
observed
monsieur
rastoil
true
said
monsieur
de
bourdeu
his
reverence
seems
to
have
filled
this
spot
with
the
peaceful
tranquillity
of
a
cloister
while
the
abbé
was
smiling
and
acknowledging
these
complimentary
remarks
monsieur
de
condamin
who
had
not
yet
seated
himself
stooped
and
whispered
in
monsieur
delangre
ear
rastoil
hoping
to
get
that
lout
of
a
son
of
his
made
assessor
to
the
public
prosecutor
monsieur
delangre
however
gave
him
an
angry
glance
trembling
at
the
thought
that
this
incorrigible
chatterer
might
spoil
everything
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
from
adding
bourdeu
too
is
flattering
himself
that
he
has
already
won
back
his
prefecture
meantime
madame
de
condamin
had
caused
a
great
sensation
by
saying
in
a
meaning
way
i
like
about
this
garden
is
the
tender
charm
it
seems
to
possess
which
makes
it
a
nook
apart
from
all
the
cares
and
wretchedness
of
the
world
it
is
a
spot
where
even
cain
and
abel
might
have
become
reconciled
she
emphasized
her
last
words
and
gave
two
glances
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
towards
the
neighbouring
gardens
monsieur
maffre
and
doctor
porquier
nodded
approvingly
while
the
paloques
looked
at
each
other
inquisitively
feeling
uneasy
and
fearing
to
compromise
themselves
should
they
open
their
mouths
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
monsieur
rastoil
rose
from
his
seat
wife
will
be
wondering
where
we
have
got
to
said
he
and
thereupon
the
whole
company
rose
feeling
somewhat
embarrassed
as
to
the
manner
of
their
but
abbé
faujas
spread
out
his
hands
and
said
with
the
pleasantest
possible
smile
paradise
is
always
open
to
you
the
presiding
judge
then
promised
to
come
and
see
the
curé
every
now
and
then
and
the
with
more
effusiveness
declared
that
he
would
do
the
same
for
another
five
minutes
they
all
lingered
there
exchanging
compliments
while
out
in
the
lane
the
laughter
of
the
rastoil
girls
and
abbé
surin
was
again
heard
a
fresh
game
was
going
on
with
all
the
animation
of
the
previous
one
and
the
shuttlecock
could
be
seen
passing
backwards
and
forwards
in
its
regular
flight
above
the
garden
wall
xv
one
friday
as
madame
paloque
was
entering
she
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
marthe
kneeling
in
front
of
chapel
the
abbé
faujas
was
hearing
confessions
she
muttered
she
succeeded
in
touching
the
abbé
heart
i
must
wait
a
little
while
and
watch
it
would
be
very
fine
if
madame
de
condamin
were
to
come
she
took
a
chair
a
little
in
the
rear
and
half
kneeling
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
though
she
was
absorbed
in
earnest
prayer
but
she
held
her
fingers
apart
so
that
she
might
glance
between
them
the
church
was
very
gloomy
marthe
with
her
head
bent
over
her
looked
as
though
she
were
asleep
her
figure
snowed
blackly
against
a
white
pillar
only
her
shoulders
heaving
with
sighs
seemed
to
be
alive
she
was
indeed
so
profoundly
overcome
with
emotion
that
she
was
constantly
allowing
her
turn
to
be
taken
by
some
other
of
abbé
faujas
penitents
the
abbé
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
then
seemingly
a
little
impatient
he
began
tapping
the
woodwork
of
the
confessional
thereupon
one
of
the
women
who
were
waiting
seeing
that
marthe
showed
no
sign
of
moving
decided
to
take
her
place
the
chapel
gradually
grew
empty
and
marthe
still
remained
motionless
as
if
in
ecstasy
seems
in
a
terrible
state
thought
madame
paloque
is
really
quite
indecent
to
make
such
an
exhibition
of
one
self
in
church
ah
here
comes
madame
de
condamin
madame
de
condamin
was
indeed
just
entering
the
church
she
stopped
for
a
moment
before
the
basin
removed
her
glove
and
crossed
herself
with
a
pretty
gesture
her
silk
dress
made
a
murmuring
sound
as
she
passed
along
the
narrow
space
between
the
chairs
as
she
knelt
down
she
filled
the
lofty
vault
with
a
rustling
of
skirts
she
had
her
usual
affable
expression
and
smiled
through
the
gloom
soon
she
and
marthe
were
the
only
two
penitents
left
the
priest
grew
more
and
more
impatient
and
tapped
yet
more
loudly
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
confessional
is
your
turn
madame
i
am
the
last
madame
de
condamin
whispered
politely
bending
towards
marthe
whom
she
had
not
recognised
marthe
raised
her
face
pinched
and
pale
from
her
extreme
emotion
and
did
not
appear
to
understand
it
was
as
though
she
were
awakening
from
some
ecstatic
trance
and
her
eyelids
trembled
ladies
come
exclaimed
abbé
faujas
who
had
now
the
door
of
the
confessional
madame
de
condamin
smilingly
rose
to
obey
the
priest
summons
but
marthe
recognising
her
hastened
into
the
chapel
to
fall
again
upon
her
knees
however
a
few
paces
away
from
the
madame
paloque
felt
much
amused
she
hoped
that
the
two
ladies
would
seize
each
other
by
the
hair
marthe
could
hear
all
that
was
said
for
madame
de
condamin
had
a
clear
voice
she
dallied
over
the
recital
of
her
sins
and
quite
animated
the
confessional
with
her
pretty
gossiping
ways
once
she
even
vented
a
little
muffled
laugh
at
the
sound
of
which
marthe
raised
her
face
soon
afterwards
madame
de
condamin
finished
her
confession
and
rose
as
if
to
retire
but
she
quickly
stepped
back
and
commenced
talking
afresh
this
time
merely
bending
her
head
without
kneeling
down
is
making
sport
of
madame
mouret
and
the
abbé
thought
the
judge
wife
to
herself
all
put
on
is
this
at
last
madame
de
condamin
really
withdrew
marthe
watched
her
as
if
waiting
till
she
disappeared
then
she
went
forward
leant
against
the
and
fell
heavily
on
her
knees
madame
paloque
had
slipped
a
little
nearer
and
was
craning
out
her
head
but
she
could
only
see
the
penitent
dark
dress
spread
out
around
her
for
nearly
half
an
hour
there
was
not
the
slightest
movement
now
and
then
she
thought
she
could
detect
some
smothered
sobs
in
the
throbbing
silence
which
was
also
broken
at
times
by
a
creak
from
the
she
began
to
feel
a
little
weary
of
her
watching
for
all
she
would
be
able
to
do
now
would
be
to
stare
at
marthe
as
she
left
the
chapel
abbé
faujas
was
the
first
to
leave
closing
the
door
of
the
with
an
appearance
of
annoyance
madame
mouret
lingered
there
for
a
long
time
bent
and
motionless
when
she
at
last
went
away
her
face
covered
with
her
veil
she
seemed
quite
broken
down
and
even
forgot
to
cross
herself
has
been
a
row
the
abbé
has
made
himself
pleasant
thought
madame
paloque
then
she
followed
marthe
as
far
as
the
place
de
where
she
stopped
and
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
at
last
having
glanced
cautiously
around
to
make
sure
that
nobody
was
watching
her
she
stealthily
slipped
into
the
house
where
abbé
fenil
resided
at
one
of
the
corners
of
the
place
marthe
now
almost
lived
at
she
carried
out
her
religious
duties
with
the
greatest
fervour
even
abbé
faujas
often
had
to
remonstrate
with
her
about
her
excessive
zeal
he
only
allowed
her
to
communicate
once
a
month
fixed
the
hours
which
she
should
devote
to
pious
exercises
and
insisted
that
she
should
not
entirely
shut
herself
up
in
religious
practices
she
for
a
long
time
requested
him
to
let
her
attend
a
low
mass
every
morning
before
he
would
accede
to
her
desire
one
day
when
she
told
him
that
she
had
lain
for
a
whole
hour
on
the
cold
floor
of
her
room
to
punish
herself
for
some
fault
she
had
committed
he
was
very
angry
with
her
and
declared
that
her
confessor
alone
had
the
right
to
inflict
penance
he
treated
her
throughout
very
sternly
and
threatened
to
send
her
back
to
abbé
bourrette
if
she
did
not
absolutely
follow
his
directions
was
wrong
to
take
you
at
all
he
often
said
do
not
like
disobedient
souls
she
felt
a
pleasure
in
his
harshness
that
iron
hand
which
bent
her
and
which
held
her
back
upon
the
edge
of
the
adoration
in
the
depths
of
which
she
would
have
liked
to
annihilate
herself
thrilled
her
with
desire
she
remained
like
a
neophyte
making
but
little
advance
in
her
journey
of
love
being
constantly
pulled
up
and
vaguely
divining
some
yet
greater
bliss
beyond
the
sense
of
deep
restfulness
which
she
had
first
experienced
in
the
church
that
forgetfulness
of
herself
and
the
outside
world
now
changed
however
into
positive
actual
happiness
it
was
the
happiness
for
which
she
had
been
vaguely
longing
since
her
girlhood
and
which
she
was
now
at
forty
years
of
age
at
last
finding
a
happiness
which
sufficed
her
which
compensated
her
for
all
the
years
and
made
her
egotistical
absorbed
in
the
new
sensations
that
she
felt
within
her
like
sweet
caresses
kind
to
me
she
murmured
to
abbé
faujas
kind
to
me
for
i
stand
in
need
of
great
kindness
and
when
he
did
show
her
kindness
she
could
have
gone
down
upon
her
knees
and
thanked
him
at
these
times
he
unbent
spoke
to
her
in
a
fatherly
way
and
pointed
out
to
her
that
her
imagination
was
too
excited
and
feverish
god
said
he
did
not
like
to
be
worshipped
in
that
way
in
wild
impulses
she
smiled
looking
quite
pretty
and
young
again
with
her
blushing
face
and
promised
to
restrain
herself
in
the
future
but
sometimes
she
experienced
paroxysms
of
devotion
which
cast
her
upon
the
in
some
dark
corner
where
almost
grovelling
she
stammered
out
burning
words
even
her
power
of
speech
then
died
away
and
she
continued
her
prayers
in
feeling
only
with
a
yearning
of
her
whole
being
an
appeal
for
that
divine
kiss
which
seemed
ever
hovering
about
her
brow
without
pressing
it
at
home
marthe
became
querulous
she
who
till
now
had
been
indifferent
and
listless
quite
happy
so
long
as
her
husband
left
her
at
peace
now
however
that
he
had
begun
to
spend
all
his
time
in
the
house
had
lost
his
old
spirit
of
raillery
and
had
grown
mopish
and
melancholy
she
grew
impatient
with
him
is
always
hanging
about
us
she
said
to
the
cook
one
day
he
does
it
out
of
pure
maliciousness
replied
rose
is
a
good
man
at
heart
i
have
found
that
out
for
the
first
time
he
has
only
put
on
that
woebegone
look
he
who
is
so
fond
of
hearing
his
tongue
wag
in
order
to
try
to
make
us
pity
him
he
really
bursting
with
anger
but
he
wo
show
it
because
he
thinks
that
if
he
looks
wretched
we
shall
be
sorry
for
him
and
do
just
what
he
wants
you
are
quite
right
madame
not
to
let
yourself
be
influenced
by
all
those
grimaces
and
pretences
mouret
kept
a
hold
upon
the
women
with
his
purse
he
did
not
care
to
wrangle
and
argue
with
them
for
fear
of
making
his
life
still
less
comfortable
than
it
already
was
but
though
he
no
longer
grumbled
and
meddled
and
interfered
he
showed
his
displeasure
by
refusing
a
single
extra
crown
piece
to
either
marthe
or
rose
he
gave
the
latter
a
hundred
francs
a
month
for
the
purchase
of
provisions
wine
oil
and
preserves
were
in
the
house
the
cook
was
obliged
to
make
the
sum
stated
last
her
till
the
end
of
the
month
even
if
she
had
to
pay
for
something
out
of
her
own
pocket
as
for
marthe
she
had
absolutely
nothing
her
husband
never
even
gave
her
a
sou
and
she
was
compelled
to
appeal
to
rose
and
ask
her
to
try
to
save
ten
francs
out
of
the
monthly
allowance
she
often
found
herself
without
a
pair
of
boots
to
put
on
and
was
obliged
to
borrow
from
her
mother
the
money
she
needed
to
buy
either
a
dress
or
a
hat
mouret
must
surely
be
going
mad
madame
rougon
cried
go
naked
i
will
speak
to
him
about
it
beg
you
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
mother
marthe
said
detests
you
and
he
would
treat
me
even
worse
than
he
does
already
if
he
knew
that
i
talked
of
these
matters
to
you
she
began
to
cry
as
she
added
have
shielded
him
for
a
long
time
but
i
really
ca
keep
silent
any
longer
you
remember
that
he
was
once
most
unwilling
for
me
even
to
set
foot
in
the
street
he
kept
me
shut
up
and
treated
me
like
a
mere
chattel
now
he
behaves
so
unkindly
because
he
sees
that
i
have
escaped
from
him
and
that
i
wo
submit
any
longer
to
be
a
mere
servant
he
is
a
man
utterly
without
religion
selfish
and
does
strike
you
does
he
but
it
will
come
to
that
at
present
he
contents
himself
with
refusing
me
everything
i
have
not
bought
any
chemises
for
the
last
five
years
and
yesterday
i
showed
him
those
i
have
they
are
quite
worn
out
so
patched
and
mended
that
i
am
ashamed
of
wearing
them
he
looked
at
them
and
examined
them
and
said
that
they
would
do
perfectly
well
till
next
year
i
have
a
single
centime
of
my
own
the
other
day
i
had
to
borrow
two
sous
from
rose
to
buy
some
thread
to
sew
up
my
gloves
which
were
splitting
all
over
she
gave
her
mother
many
other
details
of
the
straits
to
which
she
was
reduced
how
she
had
to
make
laces
for
her
boots
out
of
blackened
string
how
she
had
to
wash
her
ribbons
in
tea
to
make
her
hat
look
a
little
fresher
and
how
she
had
to
smear
the
threadbare
folds
of
her
only
silk
dress
with
ink
to
conceal
the
signs
of
wear
madame
rougon
expressed
great
pity
for
her
and
advised
her
to
rebel
mouret
was
a
monster
said
she
rose
asserted
that
he
carried
his
avarice
so
far
as
to
count
the
pears
in
the
and
the
lumps
of
sugar
in
the
cupboard
while
he
also
kept
a
close
eye
on
the
preserves
and
ate
himself
all
the
remnants
of
the
loaves
it
was
a
source
of
especial
distress
to
marthe
that
she
was
not
able
to
contribute
to
the
offertories
at
she
used
to
conceal
pieces
in
scraps
of
paper
and
carefully
preserve
them
for
high
mass
on
sundays
when
the
lady
patronesses
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
made
some
offering
to
the
cathedral
such
as
a
pyx
or
a
silver
cross
or
a
banner
she
felt
quite
ashamed
and
kept
out
of
the
way
affecting
ignorance
of
their
intentions
the
ladies
felt
much
pity
for
her
she
would
have
robbed
her
husband
if
she
could
have
found
the
key
of
his
desk
so
keenly
was
she
tortured
at
being
able
to
do
nothing
for
the
honour
of
the
church
to
which
she
was
so
passionately
attached
she
felt
all
the
jealousy
of
a
deceived
woman
when
abbé
faujas
used
a
chalice
which
had
been
presented
by
madame
de
condamin
whereas
on
the
days
when
he
said
mass
in
front
of
the
altar
cloth
which
she
herself
had
embroidered
she
was
filled
with
fervent
joy
and
said
her
prayers
with
ecstatic
thrills
as
though
some
part
of
herself
lay
beneath
the
priest
extended
hands
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
whole
chapel
of
her
own
and
even
dreamt
of
expending
a
fortune
upon
one
and
of
shutting
herself
up
in
it
and
receiving
the
deity
alone
by
herself
at
her
own
altar
rose
of
whom
she
made
a
confidant
had
recourse
to
all
sorts
of
plans
to
obtain
money
for
her
that
year
she
secretly
gathered
the
finest
fruit
in
the
garden
and
sold
it
and
she
also
disposed
of
a
lot
of
old
furniture
that
was
stowed
away
in
an
attic
managing
her
sales
so
well
that
she
succeeded
in
getting
together
a
sum
of
three
hundred
francs
which
she
handed
to
marthe
with
great
triumph
the
latter
kissed
the
old
cook
how
good
you
are
she
said
to
her
affectionately
you
quite
sure
that
he
knows
nothing
about
what
you
have
done
i
saw
the
other
day
in
the
rue
des
orfèvres
two
little
cruets
of
chased
silver
such
dear
little
things
they
are
marked
two
hundred
francs
now
you
do
me
a
little
favour
wo
you
i
do
want
to
go
and
buy
them
myself
because
someone
would
certainly
see
me
going
into
the
shop
tell
your
sister
to
go
and
get
them
she
can
bring
them
here
after
dark
and
can
give
them
to
you
through
the
kitchen
window
this
purchase
of
the
cruets
seemed
like
a
clandestine
intrigue
to
marthe
and
thrilled
her
with
the
sweetest
pleasure
for
three
days
she
kept
the
cruets
at
the
bottom
of
a
chest
hidden
away
beneath
layers
of
linen
and
when
she
gave
them
to
abbé
faujas
in
the
sacristy
of
she
trembled
so
much
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
the
abbé
scolded
her
in
a
kindly
fashion
he
was
not
fond
of
presents
and
spoke
of
money
with
the
disdain
of
a
man
who
only
cares
for
power
and
authority
during
his
earlier
years
of
poverty
even
at
times
when
he
and
his
mother
had
no
food
beyond
bread
and
water
he
had
never
thought
of
borrowing
even
a
piece
from
the
mourets
marthe
found
a
safe
for
the
hundred
francs
which
were
still
left
her
she
also
was
becoming
a
little
miserly
and
she
schemed
how
she
should
best
expend
this
money
making
some
fresh
plan
every
morning
while
she
was
still
in
a
state
of
hesitation
rose
told
her
that
madame
trouche
wished
to
see
her
privately
olympe
who
used
to
spend
hours
in
the
kitchen
had
become
rose
intimate
friend
and
often
borrowed
a
couple
of
francs
of
her
to
save
herself
from
going
upstairs
at
times
when
she
said
that
she
had
forgotten
to
bring
down
her
purse
upstairs
and
see
her
there
said
the
cook
will
be
better
able
to
talk
there
they
are
good
sort
of
people
and
they
are
very
fond
of
his
reverence
they
have
had
a
lot
of
trouble
madame
olympe
has
quite
made
my
heart
ache
with
all
the
things
she
has
told
me
when
marthe
went
upstairs
she
found
olympe
in
tears
they
the
trouches
were
too
said
she
and
their
kindness
was
always
being
abused
then
she
entered
upon
an
explanation
of
their
affairs
at
besançon
where
the
rascality
of
a
partner
had
saddled
them
with
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
to
make
matters
worse
their
creditors
were
getting
angry
and
she
had
just
received
an
insulting
letter
the
writer
of
which
threatened
to
communicate
with
the
mayor
and
the
bishop
of
plassans
do
mind
what
happens
to
me
she
sobbed
i
would
give
my
head
to
save
my
brother
from
being
compromised
he
has
already
done
too
much
for
us
and
i
do
want
to
speak
to
him
on
the
matter
for
he
is
not
rich
and
he
would
only
distress
himself
to
no
purpose
good
heavens
what
can
i
do
to
keep
that
man
from
writing
my
brother
would
die
of
shame
if
such
a
letter
were
sent
to
the
mayor
and
the
bishop
yes
i
know
him
well
he
would
die
of
shame
tears
rushed
to
marthe
eyes
she
was
quite
pale
and
fervently
pressed
olympe
hands
then
without
the
latter
having
preferred
any
request
she
offered
her
the
hundred
francs
she
had
is
very
little
i
know
but
perhaps
it
might
be
sufficient
to
avert
the
danger
she
said
with
an
expression
of
great
anxiety
hundred
francs
a
hundred
francs
exclaimed
olympe
no
he
would
never
be
satisfied
with
a
hundred
francs
marthe
lost
all
hope
she
swore
that
she
had
not
a
centime
more
she
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
speak
of
the
cruets
if
she
had
not
bought
them
she
would
have
been
able
to
give
three
hundred
francs
madame
trouche
eyes
sparkled
hundred
francs
that
is
just
what
he
demands
she
said
you
would
have
rendered
my
brother
a
much
greater
service
by
not
giving
him
that
present
which
by
the
way
will
have
to
remain
in
the
church
what
a
number
of
beautiful
things
the
ladies
of
besançon
presented
to
him
but
he
is
a
bit
the
better
off
for
them
do
give
him
anything
more
it
is
really
nothing
but
robbery
consult
me
about
what
you
do
there
is
so
much
hidden
misery
no
a
hundred
francs
will
certainly
not
be
sufficient
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
spent
in
lamentation
however
she
accepted
the
hundred
francs
when
she
saw
that
marthe
really
had
no
more
will
send
them
so
as
to
pacify
the
man
a
little
she
said
he
wo
leave
us
at
peace
long
whatever
you
do
i
beg
of
you
not
to
mention
anything
about
it
to
my
brother
it
would
nearly
kill
him
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
too
if
my
husband
knew
nothing
of
what
has
passed
between
us
he
is
so
proud
that
he
would
be
sure
to
be
doing
something
rash
to
be
able
to
acquit
himself
of
our
obligation
to
you
we
women
can
understand
each
other
you
know
this
loan
was
a
source
of
much
pleasure
to
marthe
who
henceforth
had
a
fresh
care
that
of
warding
off
from
abbé
faujas
the
danger
that
threatened
him
without
his
being
aware
of
it
she
frequently
went
upstairs
to
the
trouches
rooms
and
stayed
there
for
hours
discussing
with
olympe
the
best
means
of
discharging
the
debts
the
latter
had
told
her
that
a
good
many
promissory
notes
had
been
endorsed
by
the
priest
and
that
there
would
be
a
terrible
scandal
if
they
should
ever
be
sent
to
any
bailiff
in
plassans
to
be
protested
the
sum
total
of
their
liabilities
was
so
great
she
said
that
for
a
long
time
she
refused
to
disclose
it
only
weeping
the
more
bitterly
when
marthe
pressed
her
one
day
however
she
mentioned
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
francs
marthe
was
quite
frozen
upon
hearing
this
she
would
never
be
able
to
procure
anything
like
twenty
thousand
francs
and
thought
that
she
would
certainly
have
to
wait
for
mouret
death
before
she
could
hope
to
have
any
such
sum
at
her
disposal
say
twenty
thousand
francs
in
all
olympe
hastily
added
disquieted
by
marthe
grave
appearance
we
should
be
quite
satisfied
if
we
were
able
to
pay
by
small
instalments
spread
over
half
a
score
of
years
the
creditors
would
wait
for
any
length
of
time
if
they
were
only
sure
of
getting
their
instalments
regularly
it
is
a
great
pity
that
we
ca
find
anyone
who
has
sufficient
confidence
in
us
to
make
the
small
necessary
advances
this
matter
became
an
habitual
topic
of
conversation
olympe
also
frequently
spoke
of
abbé
faujas
whom
she
seemed
almost
to
worship
she
gave
marthe
all
kinds
of
private
details
about
the
priest
such
as
for
instance
that
he
could
not
bear
anything
that
tickled
him
that
he
could
sleep
on
his
left
side
and
that
he
had
a
on
his
right
shoulder
which
turned
red
in
may
like
the
natural
fruit
marthe
smiled
and
never
tired
of
hearing
of
these
little
matters
and
she
questioned
the
young
woman
about
her
childhood
and
that
of
her
brother
when
the
subject
of
the
money
cropped
up
she
seemed
painfully
overcome
by
her
inability
to
do
anything
and
she
even
complained
bitterly
of
mouret
to
whom
olympe
emboldened
by
marthe
language
now
always
referred
in
her
presence
as
the
miser
sometimes
when
trouche
returned
from
his
office
he
found
the
two
women
still
talking
together
but
at
his
appearance
they
checked
themselves
and
changed
the
subject
trouche
conducted
himself
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
and
the
lady
patronesses
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
were
highly
pleased
with
him
he
was
never
seen
in
any
of
the
cafés
in
the
town
in
order
to
be
able
to
render
some
assistance
to
olympe
who
sometimes
talked
about
throwing
herself
out
of
the
window
marthe
made
rose
take
all
the
useless
old
odds
and
ends
that
were
lying
about
the
house
to
a
dealer
at
the
market
at
first
the
two
women
were
a
little
timid
about
the
matter
and
only
disposed
of
chairs
and
tables
when
mouret
was
out
of
the
way
but
afterwards
they
began
to
lay
hands
upon
more
important
articles
and
sold
ornaments
pieces
of
china
and
anything
else
they
could
remove
without
its
absence
appearing
too
conspicuous
they
were
slipping
down
a
fatal
incline
and
would
have
ended
by
carting
off
all
the
furniture
in
the
house
and
leaving
nothing
but
the
bare
walls
if
mouret
had
not
one
day
charged
rose
with
thieving
and
threatened
to
send
for
the
police
sir
a
thief
i
she
cried
because
you
happened
to
see
me
selling
one
of
madame
rings
be
careful
of
what
you
are
saying
the
ring
was
mine
madame
gave
it
to
me
madame
is
such
a
mean
wretch
as
you
are
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
leaving
your
wife
without
a
sou
she
has
even
a
pair
of
shoes
to
put
on
the
other
day
i
had
to
pay
the
milkman
myself
yes
i
did
sell
the
ring
and
what
of
that
is
madame
ring
her
own
she
is
obliged
to
turn
it
into
money
since
you
wo
give
her
any
if
i
were
she
i
would
sell
the
whole
house
the
whole
house
do
you
hear
it
distresses
me
beyond
everything
to
see
her
going
about
as
naked
as
saint
john
the
baptist
mouret
now
began
to
keep
a
close
watch
at
all
times
he
locked
up
the
cupboards
and
drawers
and
kept
the
keys
in
his
own
possession
whenever
rose
went
out
he
would
look
at
her
hands
distrustfully
and
even
feel
at
her
pockets
if
he
saw
any
suspicious
swelling
beneath
her
skirt
he
brought
certain
articles
back
from
the
dealer
and
restored
them
to
their
places
dusting
and
wiping
them
ostentatiously
in
marthe
presence
in
order
to
remind
her
of
what
he
called
rose
thefts
he
never
directly
accused
his
wife
there
was
a
which
he
turned
into
a
special
instrument
of
torture
rose
having
sold
it
for
twenty
sous
had
pretended
to
mouret
that
it
was
broken
but
now
he
made
her
bring
it
and
put
it
on
the
table
at
every
meal
one
day
at
lunch
she
quite
lost
her
temper
over
it
and
purposely
let
it
fall
sir
it
really
broken
this
time
is
it
she
cried
laughing
in
his
face
as
he
threatened
to
dismiss
her
she
exclaimed
had
better
i
been
in
your
service
for
years
if
i
went
madame
would
go
with
me
marthe
reduced
to
extremities
and
egged
on
by
rose
and
olympe
at
last
rebelled
she
was
desperately
in
want
of
five
hundred
francs
for
the
last
week
olympe
had
been
crying
and
sobbing
asserting
that
if
she
could
not
get
five
hundred
francs
by
the
end
of
the
month
one
of
the
bills
which
had
been
endorsed
by
abbé
faujas
would
be
published
in
one
of
the
plassans
newspapers
the
threatened
publication
of
this
bill
this
terrible
threat
which
she
did
not
quite
understand
threw
marthe
into
a
state
of
dreadful
alarm
and
she
resolved
to
dare
everything
in
the
evening
as
they
were
going
to
bed
she
asked
mouret
for
the
five
hundred
francs
and
when
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
she
began
to
speak
of
the
fifteen
years
which
she
had
spent
behind
a
counter
at
marseilles
with
a
pen
behind
her
ear
like
a
clerk
made
the
money
together
she
said
it
belongs
to
us
both
i
want
five
hundred
francs
mouret
thereupon
broke
his
long
maintained
silence
in
the
most
violent
fashion
and
all
his
old
raillery
burst
forth
again
hundred
francs
he
cried
you
want
them
for
your
priest
i
play
the
simpleton
now
and
keep
my
peace
for
fear
i
might
say
too
much
but
you
must
not
imagine
that
you
can
go
on
for
ever
making
a
fool
of
me
five
hundred
francs
why
not
say
the
whole
house
the
whole
house
certainly
does
seem
to
belong
to
him
he
wants
some
money
does
he
and
he
has
told
you
to
ask
me
for
it
i
might
be
among
a
lot
of
robbers
in
a
wood
instead
of
being
in
my
own
home
i
shall
have
my
very
handkerchief
stolen
out
of
my
pocket
before
long
be
bound
that
if
i
were
to
go
and
search
his
room
i
should
find
his
drawers
full
of
my
property
there
are
seven
pairs
of
my
socks
missing
four
or
five
shirts
and
three
pairs
of
pants
i
was
going
over
the
things
yesterday
everything
i
have
is
disappearing
and
i
sha
have
anything
left
very
soon
no
not
a
single
sou
will
i
give
you
not
a
single
sou
want
five
hundred
francs
half
of
the
money
belongs
to
me
marthe
tranquilly
replied
for
a
whole
hour
mouret
stormed
and
fumed
and
repeated
the
same
reproaches
his
wife
was
no
longer
the
same
he
said
he
did
not
know
her
now
before
the
priest
arrival
she
had
loved
him
and
obeyed
him
and
looked
after
the
house
those
who
set
her
to
act
in
opposition
to
him
must
be
very
wicked
persons
then
his
voice
grew
thick
and
he
let
himself
fall
into
a
chair
broken
down
and
as
weak
as
a
child
me
the
key
of
your
desk
said
marthe
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
gathered
his
strength
together
for
a
last
cry
of
protest
want
to
strip
me
of
everything
eh
to
leave
your
children
with
nothing
but
straw
for
a
bed
you
wo
even
leave
us
a
loaf
of
bread
well
well
clear
out
everything
and
send
for
rose
to
fill
her
apron
there
the
key
he
threw
the
key
at
marthe
and
she
placed
it
under
her
pillow
she
was
quite
pale
after
this
quarrel
the
first
violent
quarrel
that
she
had
ever
had
with
her
husband
she
got
into
bed
but
mouret
passed
the
night
in
an
towards
morning
marthe
heard
him
sobbing
she
would
then
have
given
him
back
the
key
if
he
had
not
wildly
rushed
into
the
garden
though
it
was
still
pitch
dark
peace
again
seemed
to
be
between
them
the
key
of
the
desk
remained
hanging
upon
a
nail
near
the
mirror
marthe
who
was
quite
unaccustomed
to
the
sight
of
large
sums
felt
a
sort
of
fear
of
the
money
she
was
very
bashful
and
shamefaced
at
first
whenever
she
went
to
open
the
drawer
in
which
mouret
always
kept
some
ten
thousand
francs
in
cash
to
pay
for
his
purchases
of
wine
she
strictly
confined
herself
to
taking
only
what
was
necessary
olympe
too
gave
her
the
most
excellent
advice
and
told
her
that
now
she
had
the
key
she
ought
to
be
careful
and
economical
and
indeed
seeing
the
trembling
nervousness
which
she
exhibited
at
the
sight
of
the
hoard
of
money
she
ceased
for
some
time
to
speak
to
her
of
the
besançon
debts
mouret
meantime
relapsed
into
his
former
moody
silence
admission
to
the
seminary
had
been
another
severe
blow
to
him
his
friends
of
the
cours
sauvaire
the
retired
traders
who
promenaded
there
regularly
between
four
and
six
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
about
him
when
they
saw
him
arrive
with
his
arms
swaying
about
and
his
face
wearing
a
stupefied
expression
he
hardly
made
any
reply
to
their
remarks
and
seemed
a
prey
to
some
incurable
disease
breaking
up
he
breaking
up
they
murmured
to
each
other
he
only
it
scarcely
credible
he
will
end
by
having
softening
of
the
brain
mouret
no
longer
seemed
to
hear
the
malicious
allusions
which
were
made
before
him
if
he
was
questioned
directly
about
abbé
faujas
he
coloured
slightly
as
he
replied
that
the
priest
was
an
excellent
tenant
and
paid
his
rent
with
great
punctuality
when
his
back
was
turned
the
retired
shopkeepers
grinned
as
they
sat
and
basked
in
the
sun
on
one
of
the
seats
on
the
cours
after
all
he
is
only
getting
what
he
deserves
said
a
retired
remember
how
hotly
he
stood
up
for
the
priest
how
he
sang
his
praises
in
the
four
corners
of
plassans
but
when
one
talks
to
him
on
that
subject
now
rather
an
odd
expression
comes
over
his
face
these
worthy
gentlemen
then
regaled
themselves
with
certain
scandalous
stories
which
they
whispered
into
each
other
ears
passing
them
on
in
this
way
from
one
end
of
the
bench
to
the
other
said
a
in
a
half
whisper
is
much
pluck
about
mouret
if
i
were
in
his
place
i
would
soon
show
the
priest
the
door
thereupon
they
all
repeated
that
mouret
was
certainly
a
very
timid
fellow
he
who
had
formerly
jeered
so
much
at
those
husbands
who
allowed
their
wives
to
lead
them
by
the
nose
these
stories
however
in
spite
of
the
persistence
with
which
certain
persons
kept
them
afloat
never
got
beyond
a
particular
set
of
idle
gossiping
people
and
the
reason
which
the
curé
himself
gave
for
not
taking
up
his
residence
at
the
parsonage
namely
his
liking
for
the
mourets
beautiful
garden
where
he
could
read
his
breviary
in
such
perfect
peace
was
generally
accepted
as
the
true
one
his
great
piety
his
ascetic
life
and
his
contempt
for
all
the
frivolities
and
coquetries
which
other
priests
allowed
themselves
placed
him
beyond
suspicion
the
members
of
the
young
men
club
accused
abbé
fenil
of
trying
to
ruin
him
all
the
new
part
of
the
town
was
on
his
side
and
it
was
only
the
quarter
that
was
against
him
its
aristocratic
inhabitants
treating
him
with
great
reserve
whenever
they
met
him
in
monseigneur
rousselot
saloons
however
in
spite
of
his
popularity
he
shook
his
head
when
old
madame
rougon
told
him
that
he
might
now
dare
everything
is
quite
safe
and
solid
yet
he
said
am
not
sure
of
anyone
the
least
touch
might
bring
the
whole
edifice
toppling
down
marthe
had
been
causing
him
anxiety
for
some
time
past
he
felt
that
he
was
incapable
of
calming
the
fever
of
devotion
which
was
raging
within
her
she
escaped
his
control
and
disobeyed
him
and
advanced
further
than
he
wished
her
to
do
he
was
afraid
lest
this
woman
this
patroness
who
was
so
useful
might
yet
bring
about
his
ruin
there
was
a
fire
burning
within
her
which
seemed
to
discolour
her
flesh
and
redden
her
eyes
and
make
them
heavy
it
was
like
an
disease
an
infatuation
of
her
whole
being
that
was
gradually
weakening
her
heart
and
brain
she
often
seemed
to
lapse
into
some
ecstatic
trance
her
hands
were
shaken
by
a
nervous
trembling
and
a
dry
cough
occasionally
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
without
consciousness
apparently
on
her
part
of
how
it
was
rending
her
the
curé
then
showed
himself
sterner
to
her
than
before
tried
to
crush
the
passion
which
was
dawning
within
her
and
even
forbade
her
to
come
to
church
is
very
cold
he
said
you
cough
so
much
there
i
do
want
you
to
do
anything
to
make
yourself
worse
she
protested
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
beyond
a
slight
irritation
of
the
throat
but
at
last
she
yielded
and
accepted
his
prohibition
as
a
punishment
which
closed
the
doors
of
heaven
upon
her
she
wept
believed
that
she
was
damned
and
dragged
herself
listlessly
through
the
blank
weary
days
and
then
in
spite
of
herself
like
a
woman
returning
to
some
forbidden
love
when
friday
came
she
humbly
glided
into
chapel
and
laid
her
burning
brow
against
the
woodwork
of
the
she
did
not
speak
a
word
but
simply
knelt
there
completely
crushed
quite
overwhelmed
at
this
abbé
faujas
who
was
greatly
irritated
treated
her
as
harshly
as
though
she
was
some
unworthy
woman
and
hastily
ordered
her
away
then
she
left
the
church
feeling
happy
and
consoled
the
priest
was
afraid
of
the
effect
of
the
gloomy
darkness
of
chapel
he
spoke
upon
the
subject
to
doctor
porquier
who
persuaded
marthe
to
go
to
confession
at
the
little
oratory
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
in
the
suburb
abbé
faujas
promised
to
be
there
to
hear
her
every
other
saturday
this
oratory
which
had
been
established
in
a
large
whitewashed
room
with
four
big
windows
was
bright
and
cheerful
and
would
he
thought
have
a
calming
effect
upon
the
excited
imagination
of
his
penitent
there
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
bring
her
under
control
reduce
her
to
obedience
without
possible
fear
of
any
scandal
as
a
guard
against
all
calumnious
gossip
he
asked
his
mother
to
accompany
marthe
and
while
he
confessed
the
latter
madame
faujas
remained
outside
the
door
as
the
old
lady
did
not
like
to
waste
her
time
she
used
to
take
her
knitting
with
her
and
work
away
at
a
stocking
dear
child
she
often
said
to
marthe
as
they
were
returning
together
to
the
rue
balande
could
hear
very
well
what
ovide
was
saying
to
you
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
please
him
you
ca
care
for
him
ah
i
wish
i
were
in
your
place
to
be
able
to
kiss
his
feet
i
shall
grow
to
hate
you
if
you
go
on
causing
him
nothing
but
annoyance
marthe
bent
her
head
she
felt
deep
shame
in
madame
faujas
presence
she
did
not
like
her
she
felt
jealous
of
her
at
finding
her
always
coming
between
herself
and
the
priest
the
old
lady
dark
eyes
too
troubled
her
when
they
constantly
bent
upon
her
full
as
they
seemed
of
strange
and
disquieting
thoughts
marthe
weak
state
of
health
sufficed
to
account
for
her
meetings
with
abbé
faujas
at
the
oratory
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
doctor
porquier
stated
that
she
went
there
simply
in
obedience
to
his
orders
and
the
promenaders
on
the
cours
were
vastly
amused
by
this
saying
of
the
doctor
all
the
same
remarked
madame
paloque
to
her
husband
one
day
as
she
watched
marthe
going
down
to
the
rue
balande
accompanied
by
madame
faujas
should
like
to
be
in
some
corner
and
watch
the
vicar
and
his
sweetheart
it
is
very
amusing
to
hear
her
talk
of
her
bad
cold
as
though
a
bad
cold
was
any
reason
why
one
should
make
confession
in
church
i
have
had
colds
but
i
never
made
them
an
excuse
for
shutting
myself
up
in
a
little
chapel
with
a
priest
is
very
wrong
of
you
to
interfere
in
abbé
faujas
affairs
the
judge
replied
to
his
wife
have
been
spoken
to
about
him
he
is
a
man
with
whom
we
must
keep
on
good
terms
and
you
will
prevent
us
from
doing
so
you
are
too
spiteful
she
retorted
angrily
have
trampled
me
under
foot
and
i
will
let
them
know
who
i
am
your
abbé
faujas
is
a
big
imbecile
you
suppose
that
abbé
fenil
would
be
very
grateful
to
me
if
i
could
catch
the
vicar
and
his
sweetheart
ah
he
would
give
a
great
deal
to
have
a
scandal
like
that
just
you
leave
me
alone
you
do
understand
anything
about
such
matters
a
fortnight
later
madame
paloque
watched
marthe
go
out
on
the
saturday
she
was
standing
ready
dressed
hiding
her
hideous
face
behind
her
curtains
but
keeping
watch
over
the
street
through
a
hole
in
the
muslin
when
the
two
women
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
rue
taravelle
she
sniggered
and
leisurely
drawing
on
her
gloves
went
quietly
on
to
the
place
of
the
and
walked
slowly
round
it
as
she
passed
in
front
of
madame
de
condamin
little
house
she
thought
for
a
moment
of
going
in
and
taking
her
with
her
but
she
reflected
that
the
other
might
perhaps
have
some
scruples
and
all
considered
it
was
better
she
should
be
without
witnesses
and
manage
the
business
by
herself
have
given
them
time
she
thought
after
a
quarter
of
an
promenade
think
i
may
present
myself
now
thereupon
she
quickened
her
pace
she
frequently
went
to
the
home
of
the
virgin
to
discuss
the
accounts
with
trouche
but
that
day
instead
of
repairing
to
the
secretary
office
she
went
straight
along
the
corridor
towards
the
oratory
madame
faujas
was
quietly
knitting
on
a
chair
in
front
of
the
door
the
judge
wife
had
foreseen
that
obstacle
and
went
straight
on
to
the
door
with
the
hasty
manner
of
a
person
who
has
important
business
on
hand
but
before
she
could
reach
out
her
hand
to
turn
the
handle
the
old
lady
had
risen
from
her
chair
and
pushed
her
aside
with
extraordinary
energy
are
you
going
she
asked
in
her
blunt
tones
am
going
where
i
have
business
madame
paloque
replied
her
arm
smarting
and
her
face
convulsed
with
anger
are
an
insolent
brutish
woman
let
me
pass
i
am
the
treasurer
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
and
i
have
a
right
to
go
anywhere
here
i
want
madame
faujas
who
stood
leaning
against
the
door
straightened
her
spectacles
upon
her
nose
and
with
unruffled
tranquillity
resumed
her
knitting
she
said
bluntly
ca
go
in
there
indeed
and
may
i
ask
why
i
do
wish
that
you
should
the
judge
wife
felt
that
her
plan
was
frustrated
and
she
almost
choked
with
spleen
and
anger
she
was
positively
frightful
to
look
at
as
she
gasped
and
stammered
do
know
who
you
are
and
i
do
know
what
you
are
doing
here
if
i
were
to
call
out
i
could
have
you
arrested
for
you
have
struck
me
there
must
be
some
great
wickedness
going
on
at
the
other
side
of
that
door
for
you
to
have
been
put
there
to
keep
people
from
entering
i
belong
to
the
house
i
tell
you
let
me
pass
or
i
shall
call
for
help
for
anyone
you
like
replied
the
old
lady
shrugging
her
shoulders
have
told
you
that
you
shall
not
go
in
that
i
wo
let
you
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
belong
to
the
house
but
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
do
or
you
do
no
one
can
go
in
i
wo
let
them
thereupon
madame
paloque
lost
all
control
of
herself
raised
her
voice
and
shrieked
out
have
no
occasion
to
go
in
now
i
have
learnt
quite
sufficient
you
are
abbé
faujas
mother
are
you
not
this
is
a
very
decent
and
pretty
part
for
you
to
be
playing
i
would
enter
the
room
now
i
mix
myself
up
with
all
this
wickedness
madame
faujas
laid
her
knitting
upon
the
chair
and
bending
slightly
forward
gazed
with
glistening
eyes
through
her
spectacles
at
madame
paloque
holding
her
hands
the
while
a
little
in
front
of
her
as
though
she
were
about
to
spring
upon
the
angry
woman
and
silence
her
she
was
indeed
going
to
throw
herself
forward
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
abbé
faujas
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
was
in
his
surplice
and
looked
very
stern
mother
he
asked
is
going
on
here
the
old
lady
bent
her
head
and
stepped
back
like
a
dog
that
is
taking
its
place
at
its
master
heels
is
it
you
dear
madame
paloque
the
curé
continued
you
want
to
speak
to
me
by
a
supreme
effort
of
will
the
judge
wife
forced
her
face
into
a
smile
she
answered
the
priest
in
a
tone
that
was
terrible
in
its
amiability
and
mingled
irony
you
were
inside
were
you
your
reverence
if
i
had
known
that
i
would
not
have
insisted
upon
entering
but
i
want
to
see
the
which
must
i
think
be
getting
into
a
bad
condition
i
am
a
careful
superintendent
here
you
know
and
i
keep
an
eye
upon
all
these
little
details
but
of
course
if
you
are
engaged
in
the
oratory
i
would
think
of
disturbing
you
pray
go
on
with
what
you
are
doing
the
house
is
yours
if
madame
had
only
just
dropped
me
a
word
i
would
have
left
her
quietly
to
continue
guarding
you
from
being
disturbed
madame
faujas
allowed
a
growl
to
escape
her
but
a
glance
from
her
son
reduced
her
to
silence
in
i
beg
you
he
said
wo
disturb
me
in
the
least
i
was
confessing
madame
mouret
who
is
not
very
well
come
in
by
all
means
the
might
very
well
be
changed
i
think
no
i
will
come
some
other
time
madame
paloque
replied
am
quite
distressed
to
have
interrupted
you
pray
go
on
your
reverence
pray
go
on
notwithstanding
her
protestations
however
she
entered
the
room
while
she
was
examining
the
with
marthe
the
priest
began
to
chide
his
mother
in
a
low
voice
did
you
prevent
her
coming
in
mother
i
never
told
you
to
allow
no
one
to
enter
she
gazed
straight
in
front
of
her
with
her
obstinate
determined
glance
would
have
had
to
walk
over
my
body
before
she
got
inside
she
muttered
why
listen
to
me
ovide
do
be
angry
you
know
that
it
pains
me
to
see
you
angry
you
told
me
to
accompany
our
landlady
here
did
you
well
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
stop
inquisitive
curiosity
so
i
took
my
seat
out
here
and
no
one
should
have
entered
be
sure
of
that
but
the
priest
caught
hold
of
his
mother
hands
and
shook
her
exclaiming
mother
you
could
have
supposed
suppose
nothing
she
replied
with
sublime
indifference
are
free
to
do
whatever
pleases
you
you
are
my
child
i
would
steal
for
you
i
would
the
priest
was
no
longer
listening
to
her
he
had
let
her
hands
drop
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
reflections
which
made
his
face
look
sterner
and
more
austere
than
ever
never
he
exclaimed
with
lofty
pride
are
greatly
mistaken
mother
it
is
only
the
chaste
who
are
powerful
xvi
at
seventeen
years
of
age
désirée
still
retained
the
laugh
of
an
she
was
now
a
fine
tall
girl
plump
and
with
the
arms
and
shoulders
of
a
woman
she
grew
like
a
healthy
plant
happy
in
her
growth
and
quite
untouched
by
the
unhappiness
which
was
wrecking
and
saddening
the
house
do
you
never
laugh
she
cried
to
her
father
one
day
and
have
a
game
at
skipping
it
such
fun
she
had
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
which
she
dug
planted
with
vegetables
and
carefully
watered
the
hard
work
delighted
her
then
she
desired
to
have
some
fowls
which
devoured
her
vegetables
and
which
she
scolded
with
motherly
tenderness
with
these
occupations
of
hers
gardening
and
she
made
herself
dreadfully
dirty
perfectly
filthy
cried
rose
wo
have
her
coming
into
my
kitchen
any
more
she
dirties
everything
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
keep
her
neatly
dressed
madame
if
i
were
you
i
should
just
let
her
mess
about
as
she
likes
marthe
now
ever
preoccupied
no
longer
took
care
even
that
désirée
should
change
her
regularly
the
girl
sometimes
wore
the
same
chemise
for
three
weeks
together
her
stockings
fell
over
her
shoes
which
were
sadly
worn
down
at
the
heels
and
her
tattered
skirts
hung
about
her
like
a
beggar
rags
mouret
was
one
day
obliged
to
take
up
a
needle
himself
for
the
girl
dress
was
torn
behind
from
top
to
bottom
she
however
laughed
gleefully
at
her
nakedness
at
her
hair
that
fell
over
her
shoulders
and
at
her
black
hands
and
dirty
face
marthe
came
to
feel
a
sort
of
disgust
of
her
when
she
returned
home
from
mass
still
retaining
in
her
hair
the
vague
perfume
of
the
church
she
quite
shuddered
at
the
strong
scent
of
earth
which
exhaled
from
her
daughter
she
sent
her
into
the
garden
again
immediately
lunch
was
over
she
could
not
bear
to
have
her
near
her
distressed
disquieted
as
she
was
by
the
girl
robust
vigour
and
clear
laugh
which
seemed
to
find
amusement
in
everything
dear
how
wearisome
the
child
is
she
murmured
sometimes
with
an
air
of
nerveless
lassitude
as
mouret
heard
her
complain
he
exclaimed
in
an
impulse
of
anger
she
in
your
way
we
will
turn
her
out
of
the
house
as
we
have
done
the
other
two
i
should
be
very
glad
if
she
were
to
go
away
marthe
answered
unhesitatingly
one
afternoon
about
the
end
of
the
summer
mouret
was
alarmed
at
no
longer
being
able
to
hear
désirée
who
a
few
minutes
previously
had
been
making
a
tremendous
noise
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
he
ran
to
see
what
had
happened
to
her
and
found
her
lying
on
the
ground
she
had
fallen
from
a
ladder
on
to
which
she
had
climbed
to
gather
some
figs
fortunately
the
had
broken
the
force
of
her
fall
mouret
in
a
great
fright
lifted
her
up
in
his
arms
and
called
for
assistance
he
thought
she
was
dead
but
she
quickly
came
to
herself
declared
that
she
was
none
the
worse
for
the
accident
and
wanted
to
climb
the
ladder
again
marthe
however
had
meantime
come
into
the
garden
when
she
heard
désirée
laugh
she
seemed
quite
annoyed
child
will
kill
me
one
of
these
days
she
exclaimed
does
know
what
to
invent
to
alarm
me
i
sure
that
she
threw
herself
down
on
purpose
i
ca
endure
it
any
longer
i
shall
shut
myself
up
in
my
own
room
or
go
out
in
the
morning
and
not
return
till
evening
yes
you
may
laugh
you
great
goose
to
think
that
i
am
the
mother
of
such
a
ninny
you
are
making
me
pay
for
it
very
dearly
that
she
is
cried
rose
who
had
run
down
from
the
kitchen
a
great
burden
and
unfortunately
there
no
chance
of
our
ever
being
able
to
get
her
married
mouret
looked
at
them
and
listened
with
a
pang
at
the
heart
he
said
nothing
but
stayed
with
the
girl
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
there
they
remained
chatting
affectionately
till
nightfall
the
next
day
marthe
and
rose
were
away
from
the
house
the
whole
morning
they
went
to
hear
mass
at
a
chapel
a
league
from
plassans
dedicated
to
whither
all
the
pious
folks
of
the
town
made
a
pilgrimage
on
that
particular
day
when
they
returned
the
cook
hastily
served
up
a
cold
lunch
marthe
went
on
eating
for
a
few
minutes
before
she
noticed
that
her
daughter
was
not
at
table
désirée
hungry
she
asked
has
she
come
to
lunch
is
no
longer
here
answered
mouret
who
left
his
food
almost
untouched
upon
his
plate
took
her
this
morning
to
her
nurse
at
marthe
laid
down
her
fork
and
turned
a
little
pale
seeming
both
surprised
and
hurt
might
have
consulted
me
she
said
her
husband
without
making
any
direct
reply
continued
is
all
right
with
her
nurse
the
good
woman
is
very
fond
of
her
and
will
look
well
after
her
and
the
child
will
no
longer
be
in
your
way
and
everyone
will
be
happy
then
as
his
wife
said
nothing
he
added
the
house
is
not
yet
sufficiently
quiet
for
you
just
tell
me
and
i
will
go
away
myself
she
half
rose
from
her
seat
and
a
light
glistened
in
her
eyes
mouret
had
wounded
her
so
cruelly
that
she
stretched
out
her
hand
as
though
she
were
going
to
throw
the
at
his
head
in
her
nature
angry
promptings
were
now
being
fanned
into
life
and
she
was
growing
to
hate
this
man
who
was
ever
prowling
round
her
she
made
a
show
of
eating
again
but
she
said
nothing
further
about
her
daughter
mouret
had
folded
his
napkin
and
remained
sitting
in
front
of
her
listening
to
the
sound
of
her
fork
and
casting
lingering
glances
round
the
which
had
once
been
so
merry
with
the
chatter
of
the
children
but
was
now
so
empty
and
mournful
the
room
seemed
to
him
to
be
quite
chilly
and
tears
were
mounting
to
his
eyes
when
marthe
called
to
rose
to
bring
in
the
dessert
must
be
very
hungry
i
should
think
madame
said
the
cook
as
she
put
a
plateful
of
fruit
upon
the
table
had
quite
a
long
walk
and
if
the
master
instead
of
playing
the
pagan
had
come
with
us
he
would
not
have
left
you
to
eat
the
mutton
all
by
yourself
then
she
changed
the
plates
without
pausing
in
her
chatter
is
very
pretty
is
that
chapel
of
but
it
is
too
small
did
you
see
that
the
ladies
who
came
late
were
obliged
to
kneel
down
outside
on
the
grass
in
the
open
air
i
ca
understand
why
madame
de
condamin
came
in
a
carriage
there
no
merit
in
making
the
pilgrimage
if
you
come
like
that
we
spent
a
delightful
morning
we
madame
a
very
delightful
morning
marthe
replied
mousseau
who
preached
was
very
affecting
when
rose
in
her
turn
noticed
désirée
absence
and
learnt
of
the
girl
departure
she
exclaimed
really
it
was
a
very
good
idea
of
the
master
she
was
always
walking
off
with
my
saucepans
to
water
her
plants
we
shall
be
able
to
have
a
little
peace
now
indeed
said
marthe
who
was
cutting
a
pear
mouret
was
almost
choking
he
rose
and
left
the
without
paying
any
attention
to
rose
who
cried
out
to
him
that
the
coffee
would
be
ready
directly
marthe
now
left
alone
in
the
room
quietly
finished
her
pear
just
as
the
cook
was
bringing
the
coffee
madame
faujas
came
downstairs
in
rose
said
to
her
will
be
company
for
madame
and
you
can
have
the
master
coffee
for
he
has
just
rushed
off
like
a
madman
the
old
lady
sat
down
in
mouret
place
thought
you
did
not
take
coffee
she
remarked
as
she
put
some
sugar
into
her
cup
indeed
she
did
do
so
when
the
master
kept
the
purse
interposed
rose
madame
would
be
very
silly
now
to
deny
herself
what
she
likes
they
talked
for
a
good
hour
together
and
marthe
ended
by
relating
all
her
troubles
to
madame
faujas
telling
her
how
her
husband
had
just
inflicted
a
most
painful
scene
upon
her
on
account
of
her
daughter
whom
he
had
removed
to
her
nurse
in
a
sudden
pet
she
defended
herself
and
told
madame
faujas
that
she
was
really
very
fond
of
the
girl
and
should
go
to
fetch
her
back
before
long
she
was
rather
noisy
madame
faujas
remarked
have
often
pitied
you
my
son
was
thinking
about
giving
up
going
into
the
garden
to
read
his
breviary
she
almost
distracted
him
with
the
noise
she
made
from
that
day
forward
marthe
and
mouret
took
their
meals
in
silence
the
autumn
was
very
damp
and
the
looked
intensely
melancholy
with
only
two
covers
laid
one
at
each
end
of
the
big
table
the
corners
were
dark
and
a
chill
seemed
to
fall
from
the
ceiling
as
rose
would
say
it
looked
as
though
a
funeral
were
going
on
indeed
she
often
exclaimed
as
she
brought
the
plates
into
the
room
could
make
much
less
noise
sir
however
you
tried
there
is
much
danger
of
your
wearing
the
skin
of
your
tongue
off
do
try
to
be
a
little
livelier
sir
you
look
as
though
you
were
following
a
corpse
to
the
grave
you
will
end
by
making
madame
quite
ill
it
is
bad
for
the
health
to
eat
without
speaking
when
the
first
frosts
came
rose
who
sought
in
every
way
to
oblige
madame
faujas
offered
her
the
use
of
her
the
old
lady
had
begun
by
bringing
down
kettles
to
get
her
water
boiled
as
she
had
no
fire
she
said
and
the
abbé
was
in
a
hurry
to
shave
then
she
borrowed
some
begged
the
use
of
some
saucepans
asked
for
the
loan
of
the
to
cook
some
mutton
and
finally
in
the
end
as
she
had
no
conveniently
arranged
fireplace
upstairs
she
accepted
rose
repeated
offers
and
the
cook
lighted
her
a
fire
of
vine
branches
big
enough
to
roast
a
whole
sheep
in
the
kitchen
show
any
diffidence
about
it
she
said
as
she
herself
turned
the
leg
of
mutton
round
kitchener
is
a
large
one
is
it
and
big
enough
for
us
both
i
do
know
how
you
been
able
to
do
your
cooking
upstairs
as
long
as
you
have
with
only
that
wretched
iron
stove
there
i
should
have
been
afraid
of
falling
down
in
an
apoplectic
fit
myself
monsieur
mouret
ought
to
know
better
than
to
let
a
set
of
rooms
without
any
kitchen
you
must
be
very
enduring
kind
of
people
and
very
easily
satisfied
thus
madame
faujas
gradually
began
to
cook
her
lunch
and
dinner
in
the
mourets
kitchen
on
the
first
few
occasions
she
provided
her
own
coal
and
oil
and
spices
but
afterwards
when
she
forgot
to
bring
any
article
with
her
rose
would
not
allow
her
to
go
upstairs
for
it
but
insisted
upon
supplying
the
deficiency
from
the
house
stores
there
some
butter
there
the
little
bit
which
you
will
take
with
the
tip
of
your
knife
wo
ruin
us
you
know
very
well
that
everything
here
is
at
your
service
madame
would
be
quite
angry
with
me
if
i
did
make
you
at
home
here
a
close
intimacy
now
sprang
up
between
rose
and
madame
faujas
the
cook
was
delighted
to
have
some
one
always
at
hand
who
was
willing
to
listen
to
her
while
she
stirred
her
sauces
she
got
on
extremely
well
with
the
priest
mother
whose
print
dresses
and
rough
face
and
unpolished
demeanour
put
her
almost
on
a
footing
of
equality
they
sat
chatting
together
for
hours
before
the
fireplace
and
madame
faujas
soon
gained
complete
sway
in
the
kitchen
though
she
still
maintained
her
impenetrable
attitude
and
only
said
what
she
chose
to
say
while
contriving
to
worm
out
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
she
settled
the
mourets
dinner
tasted
the
dishes
which
she
had
arranged
they
should
have
and
rose
herself
often
made
savoury
little
luxuries
for
the
abbé
delectation
such
as
sugared
apples
or
or
fritters
the
provisions
of
the
two
establishments
often
got
mixed
together
mistakes
were
made
with
the
different
pans
the
two
dinners
being
so
intermingled
that
rose
would
cry
out
with
a
laugh
me
madame
are
these
poached
eggs
yours
really
i
do
know
upon
my
word
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
were
all
to
dine
together
it
was
on
all
saints
day
that
abbé
faujas
lunched
for
the
first
time
in
the
mourets
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
as
he
had
to
return
to
at
once
and
so
to
give
him
as
much
time
as
possible
marthe
asked
him
to
sit
down
at
their
table
saying
that
it
would
save
his
mother
from
climbing
a
couple
of
flights
of
stairs
a
week
later
it
had
become
a
regular
thing
the
faujases
came
downstairs
at
every
meal
and
took
their
seats
at
table
just
as
if
they
were
entering
a
restaurant
for
the
first
few
days
their
provisions
were
cooked
and
served
separately
but
rose
declared
this
was
a
very
silly
arrangement
that
she
could
easily
cook
for
four
persons
and
that
she
would
arrange
it
all
with
madame
faujas
do
thank
me
she
said
to
the
abbé
and
his
mother
is
a
kindness
on
your
part
to
come
down
and
keep
madame
company
you
will
cheer
her
up
a
little
i
scarcely
dare
go
into
the
now
it
is
just
like
going
into
the
chamber
of
death
it
quite
frightens
me
it
feels
so
desolate
if
the
master
chooses
to
go
on
sulking
he
will
have
to
do
so
all
by
himself
they
kept
up
a
roaring
fire
the
room
was
very
warm
and
the
winter
proved
a
delightful
one
rose
had
never
before
taken
such
pains
to
lay
the
tablecloth
nicely
she
placed
his
reverence
chair
near
the
stove
so
that
he
might
have
his
back
to
the
fire
she
paid
particular
attention
to
his
glass
and
his
knife
and
fork
she
took
care
that
whenever
the
slightest
stain
made
its
appearance
upon
the
cloth
it
should
not
be
put
on
his
side
and
she
paid
him
numberless
other
delicate
little
attentions
when
she
had
prepared
any
dish
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
she
gave
him
notice
so
that
he
might
reserve
himself
for
it
though
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
she
made
a
surprise
of
it
for
him
and
brought
it
into
the
room
under
a
cover
smiling
at
the
inquisitive
glances
directed
towards
it
and
exclaiming
with
an
air
of
triumph
is
for
his
reverence
it
is
a
stuffed
with
olives
just
what
he
is
so
fond
of
give
his
reverence
the
breast
madame
i
cooked
it
specially
for
him
marthe
carved
the
duck
and
with
beseeching
looks
pressed
the
choicest
morsels
upon
the
abbé
she
always
helped
him
the
first
and
searched
the
dish
for
him
while
rose
bent
over
her
and
pointed
out
what
she
thought
the
best
parts
they
occasionally
even
had
little
disputes
as
to
the
superiority
of
this
or
that
part
of
a
fowl
or
rabbit
then
too
rose
used
to
push
an
embroidered
hassock
under
the
priest
feet
while
marthe
insisted
that
he
should
always
have
his
bottle
of
bordeaux
and
his
roll
specially
ordering
one
of
the
latter
for
him
from
the
baker
every
day
can
never
do
too
much
for
you
said
rose
when
the
abbé
expressed
his
thanks
should
be
well
looked
after
if
it
is
good
kind
hearts
like
yours
do
you
trouble
about
it
the
lord
will
pay
your
debt
for
you
madame
faujas
smiled
at
all
these
flattering
civilities
as
she
sat
at
table
opposite
her
son
she
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
fond
of
marthe
and
rose
she
considered
their
adoration
only
natural
and
thought
it
a
great
happiness
for
them
to
be
allowed
to
cast
themselves
in
this
way
at
the
feet
of
her
idol
it
was
really
she
with
her
square
head
and
peasant
manner
who
presided
over
the
table
eating
slowly
but
plentifully
noticing
everything
that
happened
without
once
setting
down
her
fork
and
taking
care
that
marthe
should
play
the
part
of
servant
to
her
son
at
whom
she
was
constantly
gazing
with
an
expression
of
content
she
never
opened
her
lips
except
to
make
known
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
abbé
various
tastes
or
to
the
polite
refusals
in
which
he
still
occasionally
indulged
sometimes
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
pushed
him
with
her
foot
everything
on
the
table
at
his
service
he
might
eat
the
whole
contents
of
the
dish
if
he
liked
and
the
others
would
be
quite
happy
to
nibble
their
dry
bread
and
look
at
him
abbé
faujas
himself
however
seemed
quite
indifferent
to
all
the
tender
care
which
was
lavished
upon
him
of
a
very
frugal
disposition
and
a
quick
eater
his
mind
always
occupied
with
other
matters
he
was
frequently
quite
unconscious
of
the
dainties
which
were
specially
reserved
for
him
he
had
yielded
to
his
mother
entreaties
in
consenting
to
join
the
mourets
but
the
only
satisfaction
he
experienced
in
the
on
the
was
the
pleasure
of
being
set
entirely
free
from
the
everyday
cares
of
life
he
manifested
unruffled
serenity
gradually
grew
accustomed
to
seeing
his
least
wish
anticipated
and
fulfilled
and
ceased
to
manifest
any
surprise
or
express
any
thanks
lording
it
haughtily
between
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
the
cook
who
kept
anxious
watch
over
the
slightest
motions
of
his
stern
face
mouret
sat
opposite
his
wife
quite
forgotten
and
unnoticed
he
let
his
hands
rest
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
and
waited
like
a
child
till
marthe
should
be
willing
to
attend
to
him
she
helped
him
the
last
scantily
and
to
whatever
might
happen
to
be
left
rose
stood
behind
her
and
warned
her
whenever
by
mistake
she
was
going
to
give
her
husband
some
of
the
more
delicate
morsels
in
the
dish
no
not
that
the
master
likes
the
head
you
know
he
enjoys
sucking
the
little
bones
mouret
snubbed
and
slighted
ate
his
food
with
a
sort
of
shame
as
though
he
was
subsisting
unworthily
on
other
people
bounty
he
could
see
madame
faujas
watching
him
keenly
as
he
cut
his
bread
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
bottle
for
a
whole
minute
full
of
doubtful
hesitation
before
he
dare
venture
to
help
himself
to
wine
once
he
made
a
mistake
and
took
a
little
of
the
priest
choice
bordeaux
there
was
a
tremendous
fuss
made
about
it
and
for
a
whole
month
afterwards
rose
reproached
him
for
those
few
drops
of
wine
whenever
she
made
any
sweet
dish
she
would
say
do
want
the
master
to
have
any
of
that
he
never
thinks
anything
i
make
nice
he
once
told
me
that
an
omelet
i
had
made
was
burnt
and
then
i
said
they
shall
be
burnt
altogether
for
you
do
give
any
of
it
to
the
master
i
beg
you
madame
she
also
did
all
she
could
to
worry
and
upset
him
she
gave
him
cracked
plates
contrived
that
one
of
the
table
legs
should
come
between
his
own
left
shreds
of
the
clinging
to
his
glass
and
placed
the
bread
and
wine
and
salt
as
far
from
him
as
possible
mouret
was
the
only
one
in
the
family
who
liked
mustard
and
he
used
to
go
himself
to
the
grocers
and
buy
canisters
of
it
which
the
cook
promptly
caused
to
disappear
saying
that
they
so
the
deprivation
of
mustard
spoilt
his
enjoyment
of
his
meals
but
what
made
him
still
more
miserable
and
robbed
him
of
all
appetite
was
his
expulsion
from
his
own
seat
which
he
had
always
previously
occupied
in
front
of
the
window
which
was
now
given
to
the
priest
as
being
the
pleasantest
in
the
room
mouret
had
to
sit
with
his
face
towards
the
door
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
eating
amongst
strangers
now
that
he
could
not
at
each
mouthful
cast
a
glance
at
his
marthe
was
not
so
bitter
against
him
as
rose
was
she
treated
him
at
first
like
a
poor
relation
whose
presence
is
just
tolerated
and
then
gradually
grew
to
ignore
him
scarcely
ever
addressing
a
remark
to
him
and
acting
as
though
abbé
faujas
alone
had
the
right
to
give
orders
in
the
house
mouret
however
showed
no
inclination
to
rebel
he
occasionally
exchanged
a
few
polite
phrases
with
the
priest
though
he
generally
ate
in
perfect
silence
and
only
replied
to
the
attacks
by
looking
at
her
he
always
finished
before
any
of
the
others
folded
up
his
napkin
tidily
and
then
left
the
room
frequently
before
the
dessert
was
placed
upon
the
table
rose
alleged
that
he
was
bursting
with
anger
and
when
she
gossiped
in
the
kitchen
with
madame
faujas
she
discussed
his
conduct
freely
know
him
very
well
i
never
been
afraid
of
him
before
you
came
madame
used
to
tremble
before
him
for
he
was
always
scolding
and
blustering
and
trying
to
appear
very
terrible
he
used
to
worry
our
lives
out
of
us
always
poking
about
never
finding
anything
right
and
trying
to
show
us
that
he
was
master
now
he
is
as
docile
as
a
lamb
is
he
it
just
because
madame
has
asserted
herself
ah
if
he
were
a
coward
and
were
afraid
of
what
might
happen
you
would
hear
a
pretty
row
but
he
is
afraid
of
your
son
yes
he
is
afraid
of
his
reverence
the
curé
anyone
would
say
to
look
at
him
that
he
lost
his
senses
every
now
and
then
but
after
all
as
long
as
he
bother
us
any
longer
he
is
welcome
to
act
as
he
pleases
is
he
madame
madame
faujas
replied
that
monsieur
mouret
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
very
worthy
man
and
that
his
only
fault
was
his
lack
of
religion
but
he
would
certainly
adopt
a
better
mode
of
life
in
time
she
said
the
old
lady
was
gradually
making
herself
mistress
of
the
whole
of
the
ground
floor
going
from
kitchen
to
as
she
pleased
and
ever
bustling
about
in
the
hall
and
passages
when
mouret
met
her
he
used
to
recall
the
day
when
the
faujases
first
arrived
when
wearing
that
shabby
black
dress
of
hers
she
had
tenaciously
clung
to
her
basket
with
both
hands
and
poked
her
head
inquisitively
into
each
room
with
all
the
unruffled
serenity
of
a
person
inspecting
some
property
for
sale
since
the
faujases
had
begun
to
take
their
meals
downstairs
the
trouches
were
left
in
possession
of
the
second
floor
they
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
the
constant
moving
of
furniture
the
stamping
of
feet
and
the
violent
banging
of
doors
were
heard
by
those
downstairs
madame
faujas
would
then
uneasily
raise
her
head
in
the
midst
of
her
gossiping
in
the
kitchen
rose
for
the
sake
of
putting
her
at
her
ease
used
to
say
that
poor
madame
trouche
suffered
a
great
deal
of
pain
one
night
the
abbé
who
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
heard
a
strange
commotion
on
the
stairs
he
left
his
room
with
his
candle
in
his
hand
and
saw
trouche
disgracefully
drunk
climbing
up
the
stairs
on
his
knees
he
seized
the
sot
in
his
strong
arms
and
threw
him
into
his
room
olympe
was
in
bed
there
quietly
reading
a
novel
and
sipping
a
glass
of
spirits
and
water
that
stood
on
a
little
table
at
the
bedside
to
me
said
abbé
faujas
livid
with
rage
will
pack
up
your
things
in
the
morning
and
take
yourselves
off
what
for
asked
olympe
quite
calmly
are
very
comfortable
here
the
priest
sternly
interrupted
her
your
tongue
you
are
a
wretched
woman
you
have
never
tried
to
do
anything
but
injure
me
our
mother
was
right
i
ought
never
to
have
rescued
you
from
your
state
of
wretchedness
i
just
had
to
pick
your
husband
up
on
the
stairs
it
is
disgraceful
think
of
the
scandal
there
would
be
if
he
were
to
be
seen
in
this
state
you
will
go
away
in
the
morning
olympe
sat
up
to
sip
her
grog
no
indeed
she
said
trouche
laughed
he
was
drunkenly
merry
and
fell
back
into
an
armchair
in
a
state
of
happy
let
us
quarrel
he
stammered
is
a
mere
nothing
only
a
little
giddiness
the
air
which
is
very
cold
made
me
dizzy
all
and
your
streets
in
this
confounded
town
are
so
very
confusing
i
say
faujas
there
are
some
very
nice
young
fellows
about
here
doctor
porquier
son
you
know
doctor
porquier
do
you
well
i
meet
the
son
at
a
café
behind
the
gaol
it
is
kept
by
a
woman
from
arles
a
fine
handsome
woman
with
a
dark
complexion
the
priest
crossed
his
arms
and
looked
at
him
with
a
terrible
expression
really
faujas
i
assure
you
that
it
is
quite
wrong
of
you
to
be
angry
with
me
you
know
that
i
have
been
well
brought
up
and
that
i
know
how
to
behave
myself
why
in
the
i
would
touch
a
drop
of
syrup
for
fear
of
compromising
you
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
gone
to
my
office
just
like
a
boy
going
to
school
with
slices
of
bread
and
jam
in
a
little
basket
it
a
very
stupid
sort
of
life
i
can
assure
you
and
i
only
do
it
to
be
of
service
to
you
but
at
night
not
likely
to
be
seen
and
i
can
go
about
a
little
it
does
me
good
and
in
fact
i
should
die
if
i
always
kept
myself
locked
up
here
there
is
no
one
in
the
streets
you
know
what
funny
streets
they
are
eh
growled
the
priest
between
his
clenched
teeth
wo
be
friends
then
well
that
very
wrong
of
you
old
chap
i
a
jolly
fellow
myself
and
i
do
like
sour
looks
and
if
what
i
do
does
please
you
i
leave
you
to
get
on
with
your
pious
ladies
by
yourself
that
little
condamin
is
the
only
decent
one
amongst
them
and
even
she
does
come
up
to
the
from
arles
oh
yes
you
may
roll
your
eyes
about
as
much
as
you
like
i
can
get
on
quite
well
without
you
see
would
you
like
me
to
lend
you
a
hundred
francs
he
drew
out
a
bundle
of
and
spread
them
on
his
knees
laughing
loudly
as
he
did
so
then
he
swept
them
under
the
nose
and
threw
them
up
in
the
air
olympe
sprang
out
of
bed
half
naked
picked
up
the
notes
and
placed
them
under
the
bolster
with
an
expression
of
vexation
abbé
faujas
glanced
around
him
with
great
surprise
he
saw
bottles
of
liqueurs
ranged
all
along
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
a
scarcely
touched
patty
was
on
the
mantelpiece
and
there
were
some
sweetmeats
in
an
old
box
the
room
was
indeed
full
of
recent
purchases
dresses
thrown
over
the
chairs
an
open
parcel
of
lace
a
magnificent
new
overcoat
hanging
from
the
and
a
bearskin
rug
spread
out
in
front
of
the
bed
by
the
side
of
glass
of
grog
on
the
little
table
there
also
lay
a
small
gold
watch
glittering
in
a
porcelain
tray
have
they
been
plundering
i
wonder
thought
the
priest
then
he
recollected
having
seen
olympe
kissing
marthe
hands
wretched
people
he
cried
have
been
thieving
trouche
sprang
up
but
his
wife
pushed
him
down
upon
the
sofa
quiet
she
said
to
him
to
sleep
you
need
it
then
turning
to
her
brother
she
continued
is
one
and
you
might
let
us
go
to
sleep
if
you
have
only
disagreeable
things
to
say
it
is
certainly
wrong
of
my
husband
to
intoxicate
himself
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
abuse
him
we
have
already
had
several
explanations
this
one
must
be
the
last
do
you
understand
ovide
we
are
brother
and
sister
are
we
not
well
then
as
i
have
told
you
before
we
must
go
halves
you
gorge
yourself
downstairs
you
have
all
kinds
of
dainty
dishes
provided
for
you
and
you
live
a
fat
life
between
the
landlady
and
the
cook
well
you
please
yourself
about
that
we
do
go
and
look
into
your
plate
or
try
to
pull
the
dainty
morsels
out
of
your
mouth
we
let
you
manage
your
affairs
as
you
like
very
well
then
just
you
leave
us
alone
and
allow
us
the
same
liberty
i
do
think
i
am
asking
anything
unreasonable
the
priest
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
yes
i
understand
she
continued
are
afraid
lest
we
should
compromise
you
in
your
schemes
the
best
way
to
ensure
our
not
doing
so
is
to
leave
us
in
peace
and
cease
from
worrying
us
ah
in
spite
of
all
your
grand
airs
you
are
not
so
very
clever
we
have
the
same
interests
as
you
have
we
are
all
of
the
same
family
and
we
might
very
well
hunt
together
it
would
be
much
the
best
plan
if
you
would
only
see
it
but
there
go
to
bed
now
i
scold
trouche
in
the
morning
and
send
him
to
you
and
you
can
give
him
your
instructions
for
a
moment
the
priest
who
was
a
little
pale
remained
thinking
then
without
another
word
he
left
the
room
and
olympe
resumed
the
perusal
of
her
novel
while
trouche
lay
snoring
on
the
sofa
the
next
morning
trouche
who
had
recovered
his
wits
had
a
long
interview
with
abbé
faujas
when
he
returned
to
his
wife
he
informed
her
of
the
conditions
upon
which
peace
had
again
been
patched
up
to
me
my
dear
olympe
replied
way
to
him
and
do
what
he
asks
above
all
try
to
be
useful
to
him
since
he
gives
you
the
chance
of
being
so
i
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
when
he
is
here
but
in
my
own
heart
i
know
very
well
that
he
would
turn
us
out
into
the
street
like
dogs
if
we
pushed
him
too
far
and
i
do
want
to
have
to
go
away
are
you
sure
that
he
will
let
us
stay
yes
do
be
afraid
replied
the
secretary
has
need
of
me
and
he
will
leave
us
to
feather
our
nest
from
this
time
forward
trouche
used
to
go
out
every
evening
about
nine
when
the
streets
were
quiet
he
told
his
wife
that
he
went
into
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
to
further
the
abbé
cause
olympe
was
not
at
all
jealous
of
his
nightly
absences
and
laughed
heartily
whenever
he
brought
her
back
some
broad
story
she
preferred
being
left
quietly
to
herself
to
sip
her
glass
and
nibble
her
cakes
in
privacy
or
to
spend
her
long
evenings
snugly
in
bed
devouring
the
old
novels
of
a
which
she
had
discovered
in
the
rue
canquoin
trouche
used
to
come
back
slightly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
but
he
took
off
his
boots
in
the
hall
so
as
to
make
no
noise
as
he
went
upstairs
when
he
had
drunk
too
much
and
reeked
of
tobacco
and
brandy
his
wife
would
not
let
him
get
into
bed
but
made
him
sleep
on
the
sofa
if
he
became
annoying
she
caught
hold
of
him
looked
him
sternly
in
the
face
and
said
will
hear
you
ovide
is
coming
at
this
he
was
as
frightened
as
a
child
that
is
threatened
with
a
wolf
and
went
off
to
sleep
muttering
excuses
in
the
morning
he
dressed
himself
in
serious
sedate
fashion
wiped
from
his
face
all
the
marks
of
the
previous
night
dissipation
and
put
on
a
certain
cravat
which
gave
him
he
said
quite
the
air
of
a
parson
as
he
passed
the
cafés
he
bent
his
head
to
the
ground
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
he
was
held
in
great
respect
now
and
then
when
the
girls
were
playing
in
the
courtyard
he
raised
a
corner
of
his
curtain
and
glanced
at
them
with
an
affectation
of
fatherliness
though
his
eyes
glistened
beneath
their
lowered
lids
the
trouches
were
still
kept
in
check
by
madame
faujas
the
mother
and
the
daughter
were
perpetually
quarrelling
olympe
complaining
that
she
was
sacrificed
to
her
brother
and
madame
faujas
treating
her
like
a
viper
whom
she
ought
to
have
crushed
to
death
in
her
cradle
both
grasping
after
the
same
prey
they
kept
a
close
watch
on
one
another
anxious
to
know
which
would
secure
the
larger
share
madame
faujas
wanted
to
obtain
everything
in
the
house
and
she
tried
to
keep
the
very
sweepings
from
olympe
clutching
fingers
on
seeing
what
large
sums
her
daughter
drew
from
marthe
she
quite
burst
with
anger
when
her
son
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
it
like
a
man
who
despises
such
matters
and
is
forced
to
close
his
eyes
to
them
she
on
her
side
had
a
stormy
explanation
with
her
daughter
whom
she
branded
as
a
thief
as
though
the
money
had
been
taken
from
her
own
pocket
mother
that
will
do
cried
olympe
impatiently
is
your
purse
you
know
that
i
have
been
lightening
besides
i
have
only
been
borrowing
a
little
money
i
do
make
other
people
keep
me
do
you
mean
you
wicked
hussy
gasped
madame
faujas
with
indignation
you
suppose
that
we
do
pay
for
our
food
ask
the
cook
and
she
will
show
you
our
account
book
olympe
broke
out
into
a
loud
laugh
yes
that
very
nice
she
cried
know
that
account
book
of
yours
you
pay
for
the
radishes
and
butter
do
you
stay
downstairs
by
all
means
mother
stay
downstairs
on
the
ground
floor
i
want
to
interfere
with
your
arrangements
but
do
come
up
here
and
worry
me
any
more
or
i
shall
make
a
row
and
you
know
that
ovide
has
forbidden
any
noise
up
here
at
this
madame
faujas
went
downstairs
muttering
and
growling
the
threat
of
making
a
disturbance
always
compelled
her
to
beat
a
retreat
olympe
began
to
sing
jeeringly
as
soon
as
her
mother
back
was
turned
but
whenever
she
went
down
into
the
garden
the
other
took
her
revenge
keeping
everlastingly
at
her
heels
watching
her
hands
never
ceasing
to
play
the
spy
upon
her
she
would
not
allow
her
in
the
kitchen
or
for
a
moment
she
embroiled
her
with
rose
about
a
saucepan
that
had
been
borrowed
and
never
returned
but
she
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
undermine
marthe
friendship
for
her
for
fear
of
causing
some
scandal
which
might
prove
prejudicial
to
the
priest
you
are
so
regardless
of
your
own
interests
she
said
to
her
son
one
day
must
look
after
them
for
you
make
yourself
easy
i
sha
do
anything
foolish
but
if
i
were
not
here
your
sister
would
snatch
the
very
bread
out
of
your
hands
marthe
had
no
notion
of
the
drama
that
was
being
played
around
her
to
her
the
house
simply
seemed
more
lively
and
cheerful
now
that
all
these
people
thronged
the
hall
and
the
stairs
and
the
passages
the
place
was
as
noisy
as
an
hotel
what
with
all
the
echoes
of
quarrelling
the
banging
of
doors
the
free
and
independent
life
of
each
of
the
tenants
and
the
flaming
fire
in
the
kitchen
where
rose
seemed
to
have
a
whole
table
to
provide
for
there
was
a
continual
procession
of
tradesmen
to
the
house
olympe
who
became
very
particular
about
her
hands
and
refused
to
risk
spoiling
them
by
washing
plates
and
dishes
had
everything
sent
from
a
confectioner
in
the
rue
de
la
banne
who
catered
for
the
townspeople
marthe
smiled
and
said
she
enjoyed
the
present
bustle
of
the
house
she
now
greatly
disliked
being
left
alone
and
felt
the
necessity
of
occupation
of
some
sort
to
allay
the
fever
that
was
consuming
her
mouret
however
to
escape
from
all
the
racket
used
to
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
on
the
first
floor
which
he
called
his
office
he
had
overcome
his
distaste
for
solitude
he
now
scarcely
ever
went
down
into
the
garden
but
kept
himself
locked
up
from
morning
till
night
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
he
finds
to
do
in
there
said
rose
to
madame
faujas
ca
hear
him
move
and
you
might
almost
fancy
he
was
dead
if
he
wants
to
hide
himself
in
that
way
it
must
be
because
he
is
doing
something
that
neither
right
nor
proper
you
think
so
eh
when
the
summer
came
round
once
more
the
house
grew
still
livelier
abbé
faujas
received
the
guests
of
both
the
and
the
presiding
judge
beneath
the
arbour
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
rose
by
marthe
orders
purchased
a
dozen
rustic
chairs
so
that
the
visitors
might
enjoy
the
fresh
air
without
it
being
necessary
to
carry
the
chairs
hither
and
thither
it
was
now
the
regular
thing
for
the
doors
communicating
with
the
little
lane
to
remain
open
every
tuesday
afternoon
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
came
to
salute
abbé
faujas
like
friendly
neighbours
the
men
often
in
their
slippers
and
with
their
coats
carelessly
unbuttoned
and
the
ladies
in
straw
hats
and
with
skirts
looped
up
with
pins
the
visitors
arrived
one
by
one
and
gradually
the
two
sets
of
guests
found
themselves
mixing
together
gossiping
and
amusing
themselves
with
perfect
familiarity
you
afraid
said
monsieur
bourdeu
to
monsieur
rastoil
one
day
these
meetings
with
the
friends
may
be
ill
advised
the
general
elections
are
getting
near
should
they
be
ill
advised
asked
monsieur
rastoil
go
to
the
we
keep
on
neutral
ground
besides
my
good
friend
there
is
no
ceremony
about
the
matter
i
keep
my
linen
jacket
on
and
it
a
mere
private
friendly
visit
no
one
has
any
right
to
pass
judgment
upon
what
i
do
at
the
back
of
my
house
in
the
front
another
matter
in
the
front
we
belong
to
the
public
when
monsieur
péqueur
and
i
meet
each
other
in
the
streets
we
merely
bow
péqueur
de
saulaies
improves
much
on
acquaintance
the
ventured
to
remark
after
a
short
pause
certainly
replied
the
presiding
judge
am
delighted
to
have
made
his
acquaintance
and
what
a
worthy
man
abbé
faujas
is
no
no
i
have
no
fear
of
any
slander
arising
from
our
going
to
pay
our
respects
to
our
excellent
neighbour
since
the
general
election
had
begun
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
monsieur
de
bourdeu
had
felt
very
uneasy
he
declared
that
it
was
the
increasing
warmth
of
the
weather
that
affected
him
but
he
was
frequently
assailed
with
doubts
and
scruples
which
he
confided
to
monsieur
rastoil
in
order
that
the
latter
might
reassure
him
however
politics
were
never
mentioned
in
the
mourets
garden
one
afternoon
monsieur
de
bourdeu
after
vainly
trying
to
devise
some
means
of
bringing
political
matters
forward
exclaimed
abruptly
addressing
himself
to
doctor
porquier
say
doctor
have
you
seen
the
moniteur
this
morning
i
see
that
the
marquis
has
at
last
spoken
he
uttered
just
thirteen
words
i
counted
them
poor
lagrifoul
he
has
made
himself
very
ridiculous
abbé
faujas
raised
his
finger
with
an
arch
look
politics
gentlemen
no
politics
said
he
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
was
chatting
with
monsieur
rastoil
and
they
both
pretended
that
they
had
not
heard
what
was
said
madame
de
condamin
smiled
as
she
continued
her
conversation
with
abbé
surin
your
surplices
stiffened
with
a
weak
solution
of
gum
she
inquired
madame
with
a
weak
solution
of
gum
replied
the
young
priest
laundresses
use
boiled
starch
but
it
spoils
the
material
and
is
worthless
rejoined
the
young
woman
never
can
get
my
laundress
to
use
gum
for
my
petticoats
thereupon
abbé
surin
politely
gave
her
the
name
and
address
of
his
own
laundress
upon
the
back
of
one
of
his
visiting
cards
then
the
company
chatted
about
dress
and
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
the
events
of
the
week
spending
a
delightful
hour
together
and
there
were
also
games
of
shuttlecock
in
the
alley
abbé
bourrette
frequently
made
his
appearance
and
told
in
his
enthusiastic
manner
divers
pious
little
stories
to
which
monsieur
maffre
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
upon
one
occasion
only
had
madame
delangre
met
madame
rastoil
there
they
had
treated
each
other
with
the
most
scrupulous
politeness
but
in
their
faded
eyes
still
flashed
the
sparks
of
their
rivalry
monsieur
delangre
for
his
part
did
not
make
himself
too
cheap
and
though
the
paloques
were
constantly
at
the
they
contrived
to
be
absent
when
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
went
to
make
one
of
his
neighbourly
calls
upon
abbé
faujas
the
judge
wife
had
been
much
perplexed
in
mind
ever
since
her
unfortunate
expedition
to
the
oratory
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
on
the
other
hand
the
person
who
was
oftenest
to
be
seen
in
the
garden
was
certainly
monsieur
de
condamin
who
always
wore
the
most
perfect
fitting
gloves
and
came
thither
to
make
fun
of
the
company
telling
fibs
and
indelicate
stories
with
extraordinary
coolness
and
unconcern
and
deriving
a
perfect
fund
of
amusement
for
the
whole
week
from
the
little
intrigues
which
he
scented
out
this
tall
old
buck
whose
coat
fitted
so
closely
to
his
slim
figure
was
devoted
to
youth
he
scoffed
at
the
ones
went
off
with
the
young
ladies
and
laughed
gaily
in
the
snug
little
corners
of
the
garden
way
youngsters
he
would
say
with
a
smile
us
leave
the
old
ones
together
one
day
he
almost
defeated
abbé
surin
in
a
tremendous
battle
at
shuttlecock
he
was
very
fond
of
plaguing
young
people
and
made
a
special
victim
of
monsieur
rastoil
son
a
simple
young
fellow
to
whom
he
told
the
most
prodigious
stories
he
ended
indeed
by
accusing
him
of
making
love
to
his
wife
and
rolled
his
eyes
about
in
such
a
terrible
way
that
the
wretched
séverin
broke
out
into
a
perspiration
from
very
fear
the
youth
did
as
it
happened
actually
fancy
that
he
was
in
love
with
madame
de
condamin
in
whose
presence
he
behaved
in
a
tender
simpering
manner
that
extremely
amused
her
husband
the
rastoil
girls
for
whom
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
manifested
all
the
gallantry
of
a
young
widower
also
supplied
subjects
of
his
raillery
although
they
were
approaching
their
thirtieth
birthdays
he
spurred
them
on
to
indulge
in
childish
games
and
spoke
to
them
as
though
they
were
yet
schoolgirls
his
great
amusement
was
to
gaze
at
them
when
lucien
delangre
the
mayor
son
was
present
he
would
then
take
doctor
porquier
aside
and
whisper
in
his
ear
alluding
to
the
former
entanglement
between
monsieur
delangre
and
madame
rastoil
a
young
man
there
porquier
who
is
very
much
embarrassed
in
his
mind
is
it
angéline
or
is
it
aurélie
whom
he
ought
to
choose
guess
if
you
can
and
name
if
you
dare
meantime
abbé
faujas
was
very
polite
and
amiable
to
all
his
visitors
even
to
the
terrible
condamin
who
caused
so
much
disquietude
he
effaced
himself
as
much
as
possible
spoke
but
little
and
allowed
the
rival
sets
of
guests
to
coalesce
seemingly
experiencing
the
quiet
satisfaction
of
a
host
who
is
happy
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
together
a
number
of
distinguished
people
intended
by
nature
to
be
on
good
terms
with
one
another
marthe
had
upon
two
occasions
made
her
appearance
thinking
that
she
would
put
the
visitors
more
at
their
ease
by
doing
so
but
it
distressed
her
to
find
the
abbé
in
the
midst
of
so
many
people
she
much
preferred
to
see
him
walking
slowly
and
seriously
in
the
quiet
of
the
arbour
the
trouches
on
their
side
had
resumed
their
tuesday
watchings
behind
their
curtains
while
madame
faujas
and
rose
craned
their
heads
from
the
doorway
and
admired
the
graceful
manner
in
which
his
reverence
received
the
chief
people
of
plassans
madame
said
the
cook
is
very
easy
to
see
that
he
is
a
distinguished
man
look
at
him
bowing
to
the
i
admire
his
reverence
the
most
though
indeed
the
is
a
fine
man
why
do
you
never
go
into
the
garden
to
them
if
i
were
you
i
would
put
on
a
silk
dress
and
join
them
you
are
his
mother
you
know
after
all
but
the
old
peasant
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
is
ashamed
of
me
she
said
i
should
be
afraid
of
putting
him
out
i
prefer
to
watch
him
from
here
and
i
enjoy
it
more
i
can
understand
that
ah
you
must
be
very
proud
of
him
he
is
a
bit
like
monsieur
mouret
who
nailed
the
door
up
so
that
no
one
might
open
it
we
never
had
a
visitor
there
was
never
a
dinner
to
be
prepared
for
anyone
and
the
garden
was
so
desolate
that
it
made
one
feel
quite
frightened
in
the
evenings
monsieur
mouret
would
certainly
never
have
known
how
to
receive
visitors
he
always
pulled
a
sour
face
if
one
ever
happened
to
come
by
chance
do
you
think
now
that
he
ought
to
take
an
example
from
his
reverence
if
i
were
he
i
should
come
down
and
amuse
myself
in
the
garden
with
the
others
instead
of
shutting
myself
up
all
alone
i
would
take
my
proper
place
but
there
he
is
shut
up
in
his
room
as
though
he
were
afraid
they
would
give
him
some
nasty
illness
by
the
way
shall
we
go
up
sometime
and
try
to
find
out
what
he
does
one
tuesday
they
did
go
upstairs
together
the
visitors
were
very
merry
that
afternoon
and
the
sound
of
their
laughter
floated
into
the
house
through
the
open
windows
while
a
tradesman
who
had
brought
a
hamper
of
wine
for
the
trouches
made
a
clatter
on
the
second
floor
as
he
collected
the
empty
bottles
together
mouret
was
securely
locked
up
in
his
office
key
prevents
me
from
seeing
said
rose
who
had
applied
her
eye
to
the
a
moment
murmured
madame
faujas
and
she
carefully
turned
the
end
of
the
key
which
protruded
slightly
through
the
lock
mouret
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
front
of
a
big
empty
table
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
dust
there
was
not
a
single
paper
nor
book
upon
it
he
was
lying
back
in
his
chair
his
arms
hanging
listlessly
beside
him
while
he
gazed
blankly
into
space
he
sat
perfectly
still
without
the
slightest
movement
the
two
women
looked
at
him
in
silence
one
after
the
other
has
made
me
feel
cold
to
the
very
marrow
exclaimed
rose
as
they
went
downstairs
again
you
notice
his
eyes
and
what
a
filthy
state
the
room
is
in
he
has
laid
a
pen
on
that
desk
for
a
couple
of
months
past
and
to
think
that
i
fancied
he
spent
all
his
time
there
writing
fancy
him
amusing
himself
like
that
shutting
himself
up
all
alone
like
a
corpse
when
the
house
is
so
bright
and
cheerful
xvii
marthe
health
was
causing
doctor
porquier
much
anxiety
he
still
smiled
in
his
pleasant
way
and
talked
to
her
after
the
manner
of
a
fashionable
medical
man
for
whom
disease
never
has
any
existence
and
who
grants
a
consultation
just
as
a
dressmaker
fits
on
a
new
dress
but
there
was
a
certain
twist
on
his
lips
which
indicated
that
madame
had
something
more
seriously
wrong
with
her
than
a
slight
cough
and
spitting
of
blood
as
he
tried
to
persuade
her
he
advised
her
now
that
the
warm
weather
had
come
to
get
a
little
change
of
surroundings
and
occupation
by
taking
an
occasional
drive
without
however
herself
in
obedience
to
the
directions
marthe
who
was
more
and
more
possessed
by
a
vague
feeling
of
anguish
and
a
need
of
finding
some
occupation
to
assuage
her
nervous
impatience
started
on
a
series
of
excursions
to
the
neighbouring
villages
twice
a
week
she
drove
off
after
luncheon
in
an
old
refurbished
carriage
hired
from
a
plassans
coachbuilder
she
generally
drove
some
six
or
seven
miles
out
so
as
to
get
back
home
by
six
her
great
desire
was
to
induce
abbé
faujas
to
go
with
her
and
it
was
only
in
the
hope
of
accomplishing
this
that
she
had
conformed
with
the
doctor
directions
but
the
abbé
without
distinctly
refusing
always
excused
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
was
too
busy
to
spare
the
time
and
marthe
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
the
companionship
of
olympe
or
madame
faujas
one
afternoon
as
she
was
driving
with
olympe
towards
the
village
of
les
tulettes
past
the
little
estate
of
her
uncle
macquart
the
latter
caught
sight
of
her
as
he
stood
upon
his
terrace
which
was
ornamented
with
a
couple
of
mulberry
trees
is
mouret
he
cried
has
mouret
come
as
well
marthe
was
obliged
to
stop
for
a
moment
or
two
to
speak
to
her
uncle
and
to
explain
to
him
that
she
was
not
well
and
could
not
stay
to
dine
with
him
he
had
expressed
his
determination
to
kill
a
fowl
for
the
meal
he
said
at
last
kill
it
all
the
same
and
you
shall
take
it
away
with
you
then
he
hurried
off
to
kill
the
fowl
at
once
when
he
came
back
with
it
he
laid
it
on
a
stone
table
in
front
of
the
house
and
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
satisfaction
it
a
plump
splendid
fellow
at
the
moment
of
marthe
arrival
macquart
had
been
on
the
point
of
drinking
a
bottle
of
wine
under
the
shade
of
his
mulberry
trees
in
company
with
a
tall
thin
young
fellow
dressed
entirely
in
grey
he
persuaded
the
two
women
to
leave
the
carriage
and
sit
down
beside
him
for
a
time
bringing
them
chairs
and
doing
the
honours
of
his
house
with
a
snigger
of
satisfaction
have
a
very
nice
little
place
here
have
i
my
mulberries
are
very
fine
ones
in
the
summer
i
smoke
my
pipe
out
here
in
the
fresh
air
in
the
winter
i
sit
down
yonder
with
my
back
to
the
wall
in
the
sun
do
you
see
my
vegetables
the
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
i
have
another
strip
of
ground
as
well
behind
the
house
where
i
grow
potatoes
and
lucern
i
am
getting
old
now
worse
luck
and
quite
time
that
i
should
enjoy
myself
a
little
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
gently
wagged
his
head
as
he
cast
an
affectionate
glance
over
his
little
estate
then
some
thought
seemed
to
sadden
him
you
seen
your
father
lately
he
abruptly
asked
very
amiable
you
know
that
cornfield
over
yonder
to
the
left
is
for
sale
if
he
had
been
willing
we
might
have
bought
it
what
would
it
have
been
for
a
man
of
his
means
a
paltry
three
thousand
francs
is
all
that
is
asked
but
he
refuses
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
him
he
even
made
your
mother
tell
me
that
he
at
home
but
you
see
it
will
be
all
the
worse
for
them
in
the
end
he
wagged
his
head
and
indulged
in
his
unpleasant
laugh
as
he
repeated
yes
it
will
be
all
the
worse
for
them
then
he
went
to
fetch
some
glasses
for
he
insisted
upon
making
the
two
women
taste
his
wine
it
was
some
light
wine
which
he
had
discovered
at
and
in
which
he
took
great
pride
marthe
scarcely
wetted
her
lips
but
olympe
finished
the
bottle
and
afterwards
she
even
accepted
a
glass
of
syrup
saying
that
the
wine
was
very
strong
what
have
you
done
with
your
priest
uncle
macquart
suddenly
asked
his
niece
marthe
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
displeasure
without
replying
heard
that
he
was
sponging
on
you
tremendously
macquart
loudly
continued
priests
are
fond
of
good
living
when
i
heard
about
him
i
said
that
it
served
mouret
quite
right
i
warned
him
well
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
you
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
mouret
has
only
got
to
come
and
ask
me
and
i
give
him
a
helping
hand
i
never
been
able
to
endure
those
fellows
i
know
one
of
them
abbé
fenil
who
has
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
is
no
better
than
the
rest
of
them
but
he
is
as
malicious
as
an
ape
and
he
amuses
me
i
fancy
that
he
does
get
on
very
well
with
that
priest
of
yours
that
so
eh
marthe
had
turned
very
pale
here
is
the
sister
of
his
reverence
abbé
faujas
she
said
turning
to
olympe
who
was
listening
with
much
curiosity
i
said
has
no
reference
to
madame
replied
macquart
quite
unconcernedly
is
not
offended
i
sure
she
will
take
another
glass
of
syrup
olympe
accepted
another
glass
of
the
syrup
but
marthe
rose
from
her
seat
and
wished
to
leave
her
uncle
however
insisted
upon
taking
her
over
his
grounds
at
the
end
of
the
garden
she
stopped
to
look
at
a
large
white
building
that
was
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
at
a
few
hundred
yards
from
les
tulettes
its
inner
courts
looked
like
and
the
narrow
symmetrical
windows
which
streaked
its
front
with
black
lines
gave
it
the
cheerless
aspect
of
a
hospital
is
the
lunatic
asylum
exclaimed
macquart
who
had
followed
the
direction
of
marthe
eyes
young
man
here
is
one
of
the
warders
we
get
on
very
well
together
and
he
comes
every
now
and
then
to
have
a
bottle
of
wine
with
me
then
turning
towards
the
man
in
grey
who
was
finishing
his
glass
beneath
the
mulberry
tree
he
called
out
alexandre
come
and
show
my
niece
our
poor
old
woman
window
alexandre
came
up
to
them
politely
you
see
those
three
trees
he
said
stretching
out
his
forefinger
as
though
he
were
drawing
a
plan
in
the
air
a
little
below
the
one
to
the
left
you
can
see
a
fountain
in
the
corner
of
a
courtyard
follow
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
to
the
right
it
is
the
fifth
one
marthe
stood
there
in
silence
her
lips
white
and
her
gaze
fixed
in
spite
of
herself
on
the
window
pointed
out
to
her
uncle
macquart
was
looking
at
it
as
well
but
with
complaisance
manifest
in
his
blinking
eyes
see
her
sometimes
of
a
morning
he
said
the
sun
is
on
the
other
side
she
keeps
very
well
does
she
alexandre
i
always
tell
them
so
when
i
go
to
plassans
i
am
very
well
placed
here
to
keep
a
watch
on
her
i
could
be
anywhere
better
he
again
gave
a
snigger
of
satisfaction
rougons
you
know
my
dear
have
got
any
stronger
heads
than
the
macquarts
have
and
i
often
think
as
i
sit
out
here
in
front
of
that
big
house
that
the
whole
lot
will
perhaps
join
the
mother
there
some
day
thank
heaven
i
no
fear
about
myself
my
noddle
is
firmly
fixed
on
but
i
know
some
of
them
who
are
a
little
shaky
well
i
shall
be
here
to
receive
them
and
i
shall
see
them
from
my
den
and
recommend
them
to
alexandre
kind
attention
though
they
have
all
of
them
always
been
particularly
kind
to
me
then
with
that
hideous
smile
of
his
that
was
like
a
captive
wolf
he
added
very
lucky
for
you
all
that
i
am
here
on
the
spot
at
les
tulettes
marthe
could
not
help
trembling
though
she
was
well
aware
of
her
uncle
taste
for
savage
pleasantries
and
the
pleasure
he
took
in
torturing
the
people
to
whom
he
presented
his
rabbits
she
could
not
help
fancying
that
he
was
perhaps
speaking
the
truth
and
that
the
rest
of
the
family
would
indeed
be
quartered
eventually
in
those
gloomy
cells
she
insisted
upon
taking
her
immediate
departure
in
spite
of
the
pressing
entreaties
of
macquart
who
wanted
to
open
another
bottle
of
wine
where
is
the
fowl
he
cried
just
as
she
was
getting
into
the
carriage
he
went
back
for
it
and
placed
it
upon
her
knees
is
for
mouret
you
understand
he
said
with
a
malicious
expression
mouret
and
for
no
one
else
when
i
come
to
see
you
i
shall
ask
him
how
he
liked
it
he
winked
as
he
glanced
at
olympe
then
just
as
the
coachman
was
going
to
whip
his
horse
forward
he
laid
hold
of
the
carriage
again
and
said
and
see
your
father
and
talk
to
him
about
the
cornfield
see
that
field
just
in
front
of
us
rougon
is
making
a
mistake
we
are
too
old
friends
to
quarrel
about
the
matter
besides
as
he
very
well
knows
it
would
be
worse
for
him
if
we
did
let
him
understand
that
he
is
making
a
mistake
the
carriage
set
off
and
as
olympe
turned
round
she
saw
macquart
grinning
under
his
mulberry
trees
with
alexandre
and
uncorking
that
second
bottle
of
which
he
had
spoken
marthe
gave
the
coachman
strict
orders
that
he
was
never
to
take
her
to
les
tulettes
again
she
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
tired
of
these
drives
into
the
country
and
she
took
them
less
frequently
and
at
last
gave
them
up
altogether
when
she
found
that
she
could
never
prevail
upon
abbé
faujas
to
accompany
her
marthe
was
now
undergoing
a
complete
change
she
was
becoming
quite
another
woman
she
had
grown
much
more
refined
through
the
life
of
nervous
excitement
which
she
had
been
leading
the
stolid
heaviness
and
dull
lifelessness
which
she
had
acquired
from
having
spent
fifteen
years
behind
a
counter
at
marseilles
seemed
to
melt
away
in
the
bright
flame
of
her
piety
she
dressed
better
than
she
had
been
used
to
do
and
joined
in
the
conversation
when
she
now
went
to
the
on
thursdays
mouret
is
becoming
quite
a
young
girl
again
exclaimed
madame
de
condamin
in
amazement
indeed
replied
doctor
porquier
nodding
his
head
is
going
through
life
backwards
marthe
who
had
now
grown
much
slimmer
with
rosy
cheeks
and
magnificent
black
flashing
eyes
burst
for
some
months
into
singular
beauty
her
face
beamed
with
animation
extraordinary
vitality
seemed
to
flood
her
being
and
thrill
her
with
warmth
her
forgotten
and
joyless
youth
appeared
to
blaze
in
her
now
at
forty
years
of
age
at
the
same
time
she
was
overwhelmed
by
a
perpetual
craving
for
prayer
and
devotion
and
no
longer
obeyed
abbé
faujas
injunctions
she
wore
out
her
knees
upon
the
at
lived
in
the
midst
of
canticles
and
offerings
of
praise
and
worship
and
took
comfort
in
the
presence
of
the
gleaming
monstrances
and
the
brightly
lit
chapels
and
priests
and
altars
that
glittered
with
starry
sheen
through
the
dark
gloom
of
the
cathedral
nave
she
had
a
sort
of
physical
craving
for
those
glories
a
craving
which
tortured
and
racked
her
she
was
compelled
by
her
very
suffering
she
would
have
died
if
she
had
not
yielded
to
seek
sustenance
for
her
passion
to
come
and
prostrate
herself
in
confession
to
bow
in
lowly
awe
amidst
the
thrilling
peals
of
the
organ
and
to
faint
with
melting
joy
in
the
ecstasy
of
communion
then
all
consciousness
of
trouble
left
her
she
was
no
longer
tortured
she
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
in
a
painless
trance
etherealised
as
it
were
becoming
a
pure
unsullied
flame
of
love
but
faujas
severity
increased
he
tried
to
check
her
by
roughness
he
was
amazed
at
this
passionate
awakening
of
marthe
soul
this
ardour
for
love
and
death
he
frequently
questioned
her
on
the
subject
of
her
childhood
he
even
went
to
see
madame
rougon
and
remained
for
a
long
time
in
great
perplexity
and
dissatisfaction
landlady
has
been
complaining
of
you
his
mother
said
to
him
wo
you
allow
her
to
go
to
church
whenever
she
likes
it
is
very
unkind
of
you
to
vex
her
she
is
very
kindly
to
us
is
killing
herself
replied
the
priest
madame
faujas
shrugged
her
shoulders
after
her
usual
fashion
is
her
own
business
we
all
have
our
ways
of
finding
pleasure
it
is
better
to
die
of
praying
than
to
give
one
self
indigestion
like
that
hussy
olympe
do
be
so
severe
with
madame
mouret
you
will
end
by
making
it
impossible
for
us
to
live
here
one
day
when
she
was
advising
him
in
this
way
he
exclaimed
in
a
gloomy
voice
this
woman
will
be
the
obstacle
cried
the
old
peasant
woman
she
worships
you
ovide
you
may
do
anything
you
like
with
her
if
you
will
only
treat
her
a
little
more
kindly
she
would
carry
you
to
the
cathedral
if
it
rained
to
prevent
you
wetting
your
feet
if
you
would
only
let
her
abbé
faujas
himself
at
last
came
to
understand
the
necessity
of
no
longer
treating
marthe
so
harshly
he
began
to
fear
an
outburst
so
he
gradually
allowed
her
greater
liberty
permitted
her
to
seclude
herself
to
tell
her
beads
at
length
to
offer
prayers
at
each
of
the
stations
of
the
cross
and
even
to
come
twice
a
week
to
his
confessional
at
marthe
no
longer
hearing
the
terrible
voice
which
had
seemed
to
impute
her
piety
to
her
as
a
vice
believed
that
god
was
pouring
his
grace
upon
her
now
at
last
she
thought
she
was
entering
into
all
the
joys
of
paradise
she
was
overcome
by
trances
of
sweet
emotion
inexhaustible
floods
of
tears
which
she
shed
without
being
conscious
of
their
flow
and
nervous
ecstasies
from
which
she
emerged
weak
and
faint
as
though
all
her
had
left
her
veins
at
these
times
rose
would
take
her
and
lay
her
upon
her
bed
where
she
would
lie
for
hours
with
pinched
lips
and
eyes
like
a
dead
woman
one
afternoon
the
cook
alarmed
by
her
stillness
was
really
afraid
that
she
might
be
dead
she
did
not
think
of
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
mouret
had
shut
himself
but
she
went
straight
to
the
second
floor
and
besought
abbé
faujas
to
come
down
to
her
mistress
when
he
reached
marthe
room
rose
hastened
to
fetch
some
ether
leaving
the
priest
alone
with
the
swooning
woman
he
merely
took
her
hands
within
his
own
at
last
marthe
began
to
move
about
and
talk
incoherently
when
she
at
last
recognised
him
at
her
bedside
her
blood
surged
to
her
face
you
better
my
dear
child
he
asked
her
make
me
feel
very
uneasy
she
felt
too
much
oppressed
at
first
to
be
able
to
reply
to
him
and
burst
into
tears
as
she
let
her
head
slip
between
his
arms
am
not
ill
she
murmured
at
last
in
so
feeble
a
voice
that
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
breath
am
too
happy
let
me
cry
i
feel
delight
in
my
tears
how
kind
of
you
to
have
come
i
had
been
expecting
you
and
calling
you
for
a
long
time
then
her
voice
grew
weaker
and
weaker
till
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
mere
murmur
of
ardent
prayer
who
will
give
me
wings
to
fly
towards
thee
my
soul
languishes
without
thee
it
longs
for
thee
passionately
and
sighs
for
thee
o
my
god
my
only
good
thing
my
consolation
my
sweet
joy
my
treasure
my
happiness
my
life
my
god
my
all
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
as
she
breathed
these
passionate
words
and
she
clasped
her
hands
fancying
that
she
saw
abbé
faujas
grave
face
circled
by
an
aureole
the
priest
who
had
hitherto
always
succeeded
in
checking
anything
of
this
sort
felt
alarmed
for
a
moment
and
hastily
withdrew
his
arms
then
he
exclaimed
authoritatively
calm
and
reasonable
i
desire
you
to
be
so
god
will
refuse
your
homage
if
you
do
not
offer
it
to
him
in
calm
reason
what
is
most
urgent
now
is
to
restore
your
strength
rose
returned
to
the
room
quite
distracted
at
not
having
been
able
to
find
any
ether
the
priest
told
her
to
remain
by
the
bedside
while
he
said
to
marthe
in
a
more
gentle
tone
distress
yourself
god
will
be
touched
by
your
love
when
the
proper
time
comes
he
will
come
down
to
you
and
fill
you
with
everlasting
felicity
then
he
quitted
the
room
leaving
the
ailing
woman
quite
radiant
like
one
raised
from
the
dead
from
that
day
forward
he
was
able
to
mould
her
like
soft
wax
beneath
his
touch
she
became
extremely
useful
to
him
in
certain
delicate
missions
to
madame
de
condamin
and
she
also
frequently
visited
madame
rastoil
when
he
expressed
a
desire
that
she
should
do
so
she
rendered
him
absolute
obedience
never
seeking
the
reason
of
anything
he
told
her
to
do
but
saying
just
what
he
instructed
her
to
say
and
no
more
he
no
longer
observed
any
precautions
with
her
but
bluntly
taught
her
her
lessons
and
made
use
of
her
as
though
she
were
a
machine
she
would
have
begged
in
the
streets
if
he
had
ordered
her
to
do
so
when
she
became
restless
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
with
bursting
heart
and
lips
he
crushed
her
with
a
single
word
beneath
the
will
of
heaven
she
never
dared
to
make
any
reply
between
her
and
the
priest
there
was
a
wall
of
anger
and
scorn
when
abbé
faujas
left
her
after
one
of
the
short
struggles
which
he
occasionally
had
with
her
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
disdain
of
a
strong
wrestler
who
has
been
opposed
by
a
child
though
marthe
was
so
pliant
in
the
hands
of
the
priest
she
grew
more
querulous
and
sour
every
day
amidst
all
the
little
cares
of
household
life
rose
said
that
she
had
never
before
known
her
to
be
so
fractious
it
was
towards
her
husband
that
she
specially
manifested
increasing
bitterness
and
dislike
the
old
leaven
of
the
rougons
rancour
was
reviving
in
presence
of
this
son
of
a
macquart
this
man
whom
she
accused
of
being
the
torture
of
her
life
when
madame
faujas
or
olympe
came
downstairs
to
sit
with
her
in
the
she
no
longer
observed
any
reticence
but
gave
full
vent
to
her
feelings
against
mouret
twenty
years
he
kept
me
shut
up
like
a
mere
clerk
with
a
pen
behind
my
ear
between
his
jars
of
oil
and
bags
of
almonds
he
never
allowed
me
a
pleasure
or
gave
me
a
present
he
has
robbed
me
of
my
children
and
he
is
quite
capable
of
taking
himself
off
any
day
to
make
people
believe
that
i
have
made
his
life
unendurable
it
is
very
fortunate
that
you
are
here
and
can
tell
the
truth
she
fell
foul
of
mouret
in
this
way
without
any
provocation
from
him
everything
that
he
did
his
looks
his
gestures
the
few
words
he
spoke
all
seemed
to
infuriate
her
she
could
not
even
see
him
without
being
carried
away
by
an
unreasoning
anger
it
was
at
the
close
of
their
meals
when
mouret
without
waiting
for
dessert
folded
his
napkin
and
silently
rose
from
table
that
quarrels
more
especially
occurred
might
leave
the
table
at
the
same
time
as
other
people
marthe
would
bitterly
remark
is
not
very
polite
of
you
to
behave
in
that
way
have
finished
and
i
am
going
away
mouret
replied
in
his
drawling
voice
marthe
began
to
imagine
that
her
husband
daily
retreat
from
table
was
an
intentional
slight
to
abbé
faujas
and
thereupon
she
lost
all
control
over
herself
are
a
perfect
boor
you
make
me
feel
quite
ashamed
she
cried
should
have
a
nice
time
of
it
with
you
if
i
had
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
make
some
friends
who
console
me
for
your
boorish
ways
you
do
even
know
how
to
behave
yourself
at
table
you
prevent
me
from
enjoying
a
single
meal
stay
where
you
are
do
you
hear
if
you
want
to
eat
any
more
you
can
look
at
us
he
finished
folding
his
napkin
as
calmly
as
though
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
what
his
wife
had
said
and
then
with
slow
and
deliberate
steps
he
left
the
room
they
could
hear
him
go
upstairs
and
lock
himself
in
his
office
thereupon
marthe
choking
with
anger
burst
out
the
monster
he
is
killing
me
he
is
killing
me
madame
faujas
was
obliged
to
console
and
soothe
her
rose
ran
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
so
that
mouret
might
hear
her
through
the
closed
door
are
a
monster
sir
madame
is
quite
right
to
call
you
a
monster
some
of
their
quarrels
were
particularly
violent
marthe
whose
reason
was
on
the
verge
of
giving
way
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
her
husband
wished
to
beat
her
it
was
a
fixed
idea
of
hers
she
asserted
that
he
was
only
waiting
and
watching
for
an
opportunity
he
had
not
dared
to
do
it
yet
she
said
because
he
had
never
found
her
alone
and
in
the
he
was
afraid
lest
she
should
cry
out
for
assistance
rose
on
her
side
swore
that
she
had
seen
her
master
hiding
a
thick
stick
in
his
office
madame
faujas
and
olympe
showed
no
hesitation
in
believing
these
stories
expressed
the
greatest
pity
for
their
landlady
and
constituted
themselves
her
protectors
brute
as
they
now
called
mouret
would
not
venture
they
said
to
her
in
their
presence
and
they
told
her
to
come
for
them
at
night
if
he
should
show
the
least
sign
of
violence
the
house
was
now
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
is
capable
of
any
wickedness
exclaimed
the
cook
that
year
marthe
observed
all
the
religious
ceremonies
of
passion
week
with
the
greatest
fervour
on
good
friday
she
knelt
in
agony
in
the
church
while
the
candles
were
extinguished
one
by
one
midst
the
mournful
swell
of
voices
rising
through
the
gloomy
nave
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
own
breath
were
dying
away
with
the
light
of
the
candles
when
the
last
one
went
out
and
the
darkness
in
front
of
her
seemed
implacable
and
repelling
she
fainted
away
remaining
for
an
hour
bent
in
an
attitude
of
prayer
without
the
women
around
her
being
aware
of
her
condition
when
she
came
to
herself
the
church
was
deserted
she
imagined
that
she
was
being
scourged
with
rods
and
that
blood
was
streaming
from
her
limbs
she
experienced
too
such
excruciating
pains
in
her
head
that
she
raised
her
hands
to
it
as
if
to
pull
out
thorns
whose
points
she
seemed
to
feel
piercing
her
skull
she
was
in
a
strange
condition
at
dinner
that
evening
she
was
still
suffering
from
nervous
shock
when
she
closed
her
eyes
she
saw
the
souls
of
the
expiring
candles
flitting
away
through
the
darkness
and
she
mechanically
examined
her
hands
for
the
wounds
whence
her
blood
had
streamed
all
the
passion
bled
within
her
madame
faujas
seeing
her
so
unwell
persuaded
her
to
go
to
rest
early
accompanied
her
to
her
room
and
put
her
to
bed
mouret
who
had
a
key
of
the
bedroom
had
already
retired
to
his
office
where
he
spent
his
evenings
when
marthe
covered
up
to
her
chin
with
the
blankets
said
that
she
was
quite
warm
and
felt
better
madame
faujas
went
to
blow
out
the
candle
that
she
might
be
better
able
to
sleep
but
at
this
marthe
sprang
up
in
fear
and
cried
out
beseechingly
no
do
put
out
the
light
put
it
on
the
drawers
so
that
i
can
see
it
i
should
die
if
i
were
left
in
the
dark
then
with
staring
eyes
trembling
as
though
at
the
recollection
of
some
dreadful
tragedy
she
murmured
in
tones
of
terrified
pity
it
is
horrible
it
is
horrible
she
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
and
seemed
to
drop
asleep
and
madame
faujas
then
silently
left
the
room
that
evening
the
whole
house
was
in
bed
by
ten
as
rose
went
upstairs
she
noticed
that
mouret
was
still
in
his
office
she
peeped
through
the
and
saw
him
asleep
there
with
his
head
on
the
table
and
a
smoking
dismally
by
his
side
i
wo
wake
him
she
said
to
herself
as
she
continued
her
journey
upstairs
him
get
a
stiff
neck
if
he
likes
about
midnight
when
the
whole
house
was
wrapped
in
slumber
cries
were
heard
proceeding
from
the
first
floor
at
first
they
were
but
wails
but
they
soon
grew
into
loud
howls
like
the
hoarse
choking
calls
of
one
who
is
being
murdered
abbé
faujas
awaking
with
a
start
called
his
mother
who
scarcely
gave
herself
time
to
slip
on
a
petticoat
before
she
went
to
knock
at
rose
door
down
immediately
she
said
afraid
madame
mouret
is
being
murdered
the
screams
became
louder
than
ever
the
whole
house
was
soon
astir
olympe
with
her
shoulders
simply
hidden
by
a
kerchief
made
her
appearance
with
trouche
who
had
only
just
returned
home
slightly
intoxicated
rose
hastened
downstairs
followed
by
the
lodgers
the
door
madame
open
the
door
she
cried
excitedly
hammering
with
her
fist
on
madame
mouret
door
deep
sighs
alone
answered
her
then
there
was
the
sound
of
a
body
falling
and
a
terrible
struggle
seemed
to
be
taking
place
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
overturned
furniture
the
walls
shook
with
repeated
heavy
blows
and
a
sound
like
a
passed
under
the
door
so
terrible
that
the
faujases
and
the
trouches
turned
pale
as
they
looked
at
each
other
husband
is
murdering
her
murmured
olympe
you
are
right
the
brute
is
killing
her
said
the
cook
saw
him
pretending
to
be
asleep
when
i
came
up
to
bed
but
he
was
planning
it
all
then
she
once
more
thundered
on
the
door
with
both
her
fists
repeating
the
door
sir
we
shall
go
for
the
police
if
you
do
oh
the
scoundrel
he
will
end
his
days
on
the
scaffold
then
the
groans
and
cries
began
again
trouche
declared
that
the
blackguard
must
be
bleeding
the
poor
lady
like
a
fowl
must
do
something
more
than
knock
at
the
door
said
abbé
faujas
coming
forward
a
moment
he
put
one
of
his
broad
shoulders
to
the
door
and
with
a
slow
persistent
effort
forced
it
open
the
women
then
rushed
into
the
room
where
the
most
extraordinary
spectacle
met
their
eyes
marthe
her
torn
lay
panting
on
the
floor
bruised
scratched
and
bleeding
her
dishevelled
hair
was
twined
round
the
leg
of
a
chair
and
her
hands
had
so
firmly
gripped
hold
of
the
chest
of
drawers
that
it
was
pulled
from
its
place
and
now
stood
in
front
of
the
door
mouret
was
standing
in
a
corner
holding
the
candle
and
gazing
at
his
wife
with
an
expression
of
stupefaction
abbé
faujas
had
to
push
the
chest
of
drawers
on
one
side
are
a
monster
cried
rose
rushing
up
to
mouret
and
shaking
her
fist
at
him
treat
a
woman
like
that
he
would
have
killed
her
if
we
had
come
in
time
to
prevent
him
madame
faujas
and
olympe
bent
down
over
marthe
dear
said
the
former
had
a
presentiment
of
something
this
evening
she
was
quite
frightened
are
you
hurt
asked
olympe
is
nothing
broken
is
there
look
at
her
shoulder
it
quite
black
and
her
knee
is
dreadfully
grazed
make
yourself
easy
we
are
with
you
and
we
will
protect
you
but
marthe
was
now
simply
wailing
like
a
child
while
the
two
women
were
examining
her
forgetting
that
there
were
men
in
the
room
the
abbé
quietly
put
the
furniture
in
order
then
rose
helped
madame
faujas
and
olympe
to
carry
marthe
back
to
bed
and
when
they
had
done
so
and
had
knotted
up
her
hair
they
lingered
for
a
moment
looking
curiously
round
the
room
and
waiting
for
explanations
mouret
still
stood
in
the
same
corner
holding
the
candle
as
though
petrified
by
what
he
had
seen
assure
you
he
said
i
did
hurt
her
i
did
touch
her
with
the
tip
of
my
finger
even
been
waiting
for
your
opportunity
this
month
past
cried
rose
in
a
fury
all
know
that
well
enough
we
have
watched
you
the
dear
lady
was
quite
expecting
your
brutality
do
tell
lies
about
it
they
put
me
quite
beside
myself
the
other
women
cast
threatening
glances
at
him
though
they
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
speak
to
him
in
the
same
way
as
rose
had
done
assure
you
repeated
mouret
in
a
gentle
voice
i
did
not
strike
her
i
was
just
about
to
get
into
bed
but
the
moment
i
touched
the
candle
which
was
standing
on
the
drawers
she
awoke
with
a
start
stretched
out
her
arms
with
a
cry
and
then
began
to
beat
her
forehead
with
her
fists
and
tear
her
flesh
with
her
nails
the
cook
shook
her
head
furiously
did
you
open
the
door
she
cried
knocked
loud
enough
assure
you
that
i
have
done
nothing
he
reiterated
still
more
gently
than
before
could
not
tell
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
threw
herself
upon
the
floor
bit
herself
and
leapt
about
so
violently
as
almost
to
break
the
furniture
i
did
not
dare
to
go
near
her
i
was
quite
overcome
i
twice
called
to
you
to
come
in
but
she
was
screaming
so
loudly
that
she
must
have
prevented
you
from
hearing
me
i
was
in
a
terrible
fright
but
i
have
done
nothing
i
assure
you
yes
she
been
beating
herself
has
she
jeered
rose
then
addressing
herself
to
madame
faujas
she
added
threw
his
stick
out
of
the
window
no
doubt
when
he
heard
us
coming
mouret
at
last
put
the
candle
back
upon
the
chest
of
drawers
and
seated
himself
on
a
chair
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
defend
himself
but
gazed
with
stupefaction
at
the
women
who
were
shaking
their
skinny
arms
in
front
of
the
bed
trouche
had
exchanged
a
glance
with
abbé
faujas
that
poor
fellow
mouret
certainly
had
no
very
ferocious
appearance
as
he
sat
there
in
his
with
a
yellow
handkerchief
tied
round
his
bald
head
however
the
others
all
closed
round
the
bed
and
looked
at
marthe
who
with
distorted
face
seemed
to
be
waking
from
a
dream
is
the
matter
rose
she
asked
are
all
these
people
doing
here
i
am
quite
exhausted
ask
them
to
leave
me
in
peace
rose
hesitated
for
a
moment
husband
is
in
the
room
madame
she
said
at
last
you
afraid
to
remain
alone
with
him
marthe
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
no
not
at
all
she
replied
away
i
am
very
sleepy
thereupon
the
five
people
quitted
the
room
leaving
mouret
seated
on
the
chair
staring
blankly
towards
the
bed
wo
be
able
to
fasten
the
door
again
the
cook
exclaimed
as
she
went
back
upstairs
the
very
first
sound
i
shall
fly
down
and
be
at
him
i
shall
go
to
bed
with
my
things
on
did
you
hear
what
stories
the
dear
lady
told
to
prevent
him
from
appearing
such
a
brute
she
would
let
herself
be
murdered
rather
than
accuse
him
what
a
hypocritical
face
he
has
has
he
the
three
women
remained
for
a
few
moments
on
the
landing
of
the
second
floor
holding
their
candlesticks
the
while
no
punishment
said
they
would
be
severe
enough
for
such
a
man
then
they
separated
the
house
fell
into
its
wonted
quietness
and
the
remainder
of
the
night
passed
off
peacefully
the
next
morning
when
the
three
women
eagerly
referred
to
the
terrible
scene
they
found
marthe
nervous
shamefaced
and
confused
she
gave
them
no
answer
but
cut
the
conversation
short
when
she
was
alone
she
sent
for
a
workman
to
come
and
mend
the
door
madame
faujas
and
olympe
came
to
the
conclusion
that
madame
mouret
reticence
was
caused
by
a
desire
to
avoid
scandal
the
next
day
easter
day
marthe
tasted
at
all
the
sweetness
of
an
awakening
of
the
soul
amidst
the
triumphant
joys
of
the
resurrection
the
gloom
of
good
friday
was
swept
away
by
the
brightness
of
easter
the
church
was
decked
in
white
and
was
full
of
perfume
and
light
as
though
for
the
celebration
of
some
divine
nuptials
the
voices
of
the
sounded
and
marthe
amidst
their
songs
of
joyful
praise
felt
transported
by
even
more
thrilling
overwhelming
sensations
than
during
the
celebration
of
the
crucifixion
she
returned
home
with
glistening
eyes
and
hot
dry
tongue
and
sat
up
late
talking
with
a
gaiety
that
was
unusual
in
her
mouret
was
already
in
bed
when
she
at
last
went
upstairs
about
midnight
terrible
cries
again
echoed
through
the
house
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
two
days
previously
was
repeated
only
on
this
occasion
at
the
first
knock
mouret
came
in
his
and
with
distracted
face
to
open
the
door
marthe
still
dressed
was
lying
on
her
stomach
sobbing
violently
and
beating
her
head
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
bodice
of
her
dress
looked
as
though
it
had
been
torn
open
and
there
were
two
big
scratches
on
her
throat
has
tried
to
strangle
her
this
time
exclaimed
rose
the
women
undressed
her
mouret
after
opening
the
door
had
got
back
into
bed
trembling
all
over
and
as
pale
as
a
sheet
he
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
he
did
not
even
appear
to
hear
the
indignant
remarks
that
were
made
about
him
but
simply
covered
himself
up
and
lay
close
to
the
wall
similar
scenes
now
took
place
at
irregular
intervals
the
house
lived
in
a
state
of
fear
lest
a
crime
should
be
committed
and
at
the
slightest
noise
the
occupants
of
the
second
floor
were
astir
marthe
however
still
avoided
all
allusions
to
the
matter
and
absolutely
forbade
rose
to
prepare
a
folding
bed
for
mouret
in
his
office
when
the
morning
came
it
seemed
to
take
away
from
her
the
very
recollection
of
the
scene
of
the
night
however
it
was
gradually
reported
about
the
neighbourhood
that
strange
things
happened
at
the
mourets
it
was
said
that
the
husband
belaboured
his
wife
every
night
with
a
bludgeon
rose
had
made
madame
faujas
and
olympe
swear
that
they
would
say
nothing
on
the
subject
as
her
mistress
seemingly
wished
to
keep
silence
upon
it
but
she
herself
by
her
expressions
of
pity
and
her
allusions
and
her
reservations
materially
contributed
to
set
afloat
amongst
the
tradesmen
the
stories
that
became
current
the
butcher
who
was
a
great
jester
asserted
that
mouret
had
thrashed
his
wife
on
account
of
the
priest
but
the
greengrocer
wife
defended
poor
lady
who
was
she
declared
an
innocent
lamb
quite
incapable
of
doing
any
wrong
the
baker
spouse
on
the
other
hand
considered
that
mouret
was
one
of
those
men
who
their
wives
for
mere
pleasure
and
amusement
in
the
people
raised
their
eyes
to
heaven
when
they
spoke
of
the
matter
and
referred
to
marthe
in
the
same
terms
of
caressing
endearment
that
they
would
have
used
in
speaking
of
a
sick
child
whenever
olympe
went
to
buy
a
pound
of
cherries
or
a
basket
of
strawberries
the
conversation
inevitably
turned
upon
the
mourets
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
a
stream
of
sympathetic
remarks
and
how
are
things
getting
on
in
your
house
do
speak
of
it
she
is
weeping
her
life
away
it
is
most
pitiable
one
could
almost
wish
to
see
her
die
came
to
buy
some
anchovies
the
other
day
and
i
noticed
that
one
of
her
cheeks
was
scratched
yes
he
nearly
kills
her
if
you
could
only
see
her
body
as
i
have
seen
it
it
is
nothing
but
one
big
sore
when
she
is
down
on
the
ground
he
kicks
her
with
his
heels
i
am
in
constant
fear
of
finding
in
the
morning
that
he
has
split
her
head
open
during
the
night
must
be
very
unpleasant
for
you
living
in
such
a
house
i
should
go
somewhere
else
if
i
were
in
your
place
it
would
make
me
quite
ill
to
be
mixed
up
with
such
horrors
every
night
what
would
become
of
the
poor
woman
she
is
so
refined
and
gentle
we
stay
on
for
her
sake
five
sous
is
it
this
pound
of
cherries
five
sous
well
it
very
good
of
you
you
show
a
kind
heart
this
story
of
a
husband
who
waited
till
midnight
to
fall
upon
his
wife
with
a
bludgeon
excited
the
greatest
interest
amongst
the
gossips
of
the
there
were
further
terrible
details
every
day
one
pious
woman
asserted
that
mouret
was
possessed
by
an
evil
spirit
and
that
he
seized
his
wife
by
the
neck
with
his
teeth
with
such
violence
that
abbé
faujas
was
obliged
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
three
times
in
the
air
with
his
left
thumb
before
the
monster
could
be
made
to
let
go
his
hold
then
she
added
mouret
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
great
lump
and
a
huge
black
rat
leapt
out
of
his
mouth
and
vanished
though
not
the
slightest
hole
could
be
discovered
in
the
flooring
the
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
taravelle
terrified
the
neighbourhood
by
promulgating
the
theory
that
scoundrel
had
perhaps
been
bitten
by
a
mad
dog
the
story
however
was
not
credited
among
the
higher
classes
of
the
inhabitants
of
plassans
when
it
was
mooted
about
the
cours
sauvaire
it
afforded
the
retired
traders
much
amusement
as
they
sat
on
the
benches
there
basking
in
the
warm
may
sun
is
quite
incapable
of
beating
his
wife
said
the
retired
looks
as
though
he
had
had
a
whipping
himself
and
he
no
longer
even
comes
out
for
a
turn
on
the
promenade
his
wife
must
be
keeping
him
on
dry
bread
can
never
tell
said
a
retired
captain
knew
an
officer
in
my
regiment
whose
wife
used
to
box
his
ears
for
a
mere
yes
or
no
that
went
on
for
ten
years
then
one
day
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
kick
him
but
that
made
him
quite
furious
and
he
nearly
strangled
her
perhaps
mouret
has
the
same
dislike
to
being
kicked
as
my
friend
had
probably
has
a
yet
greater
dislike
to
priests
said
another
of
the
company
with
a
sneer
for
some
time
madame
rougon
appeared
quite
unconscious
of
the
scandal
which
was
occupying
the
attention
of
the
town
she
preserved
a
smiling
face
and
ignored
the
allusions
which
were
made
before
her
one
day
however
after
a
long
visit
from
monsieur
delangre
she
arrived
at
her
daughter
house
looking
greatly
distressed
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
dear
she
cried
clasping
marthe
in
her
arms
is
this
that
i
have
just
heard
can
your
husband
really
have
so
far
forgotten
himself
so
as
to
have
raised
his
hand
against
you
it
is
all
a
pack
of
falsehoods
is
it
i
have
given
it
the
strongest
denial
i
know
mouret
he
has
been
badly
brought
up
but
he
is
not
a
wicked
man
marthe
blushed
she
was
overcome
by
that
embarrassment
and
shame
which
she
experienced
every
time
this
subject
was
alluded
to
in
her
presence
madame
will
never
complain
cried
rose
with
her
customary
boldness
should
have
come
and
informed
you
a
long
time
ago
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
madame
being
angry
with
me
the
old
lady
let
her
hands
fall
with
an
expression
of
extreme
grief
and
surprise
is
really
true
then
she
exclaimed
he
beats
you
oh
the
wretch
the
wretch
thereupon
she
began
to
weep
me
to
have
lived
to
my
age
to
see
such
things
a
man
whom
we
have
overwhelmed
with
kindnesses
ever
since
his
father
death
when
he
was
only
a
little
clerk
with
us
it
was
rougon
who
desired
your
marriage
i
told
him
more
than
once
that
mouret
looked
like
a
scoundrel
he
has
never
treated
us
well
and
he
only
came
to
live
at
plassans
for
the
sake
of
setting
us
at
defiance
with
the
few
sous
he
has
got
together
thank
heaven
we
stand
in
no
need
of
him
we
are
richer
than
he
is
and
it
is
that
which
annoys
him
he
is
very
and
so
jealous
that
he
has
always
refused
to
set
foot
in
my
he
knows
he
would
burst
with
envy
there
but
i
wo
leave
you
in
the
power
of
such
a
monster
my
dear
there
are
laws
happily
do
be
uneasy
there
has
been
much
exaggeration
i
assure
you
said
marthe
who
was
growing
more
and
more
ill
at
ease
see
that
she
is
trying
to
defend
him
cried
the
cook
at
this
moment
abbé
faujas
and
trouche
who
had
been
conferring
together
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
came
up
attracted
by
the
sound
of
the
conversation
am
a
most
unhappy
mother
your
reverence
said
madame
rougon
piteously
have
only
one
daughter
near
me
now
and
i
hear
she
is
weeping
her
eyes
out
from
but
you
live
in
the
same
house
and
i
beg
you
to
protect
and
console
her
the
abbé
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
old
woman
as
though
he
were
trying
to
guess
the
real
meaning
of
this
sudden
manifestation
of
distress
have
just
seen
some
one
whom
i
would
rather
not
name
she
continued
returning
the
abbé
glance
person
has
quite
alarmed
me
god
knows
that
i
do
want
to
do
anything
to
injure
my
but
it
is
my
duty
is
it
not
to
defend
my
daughter
interests
well
my
is
a
wretch
he
his
wife
he
scandalises
the
whole
town
and
mixes
himself
up
in
all
sorts
of
dirty
affairs
you
will
see
that
he
will
also
compromise
himself
in
political
matters
when
the
elections
come
on
the
last
time
it
was
he
who
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
of
the
suburbs
it

conduct

to
say

that
we
should
be
dishonoured

trouche
who
was
swaying
himself
about
took
advantage
of
a
momentary
pause
to
exclaim
mouret
is
mad
the
words
seemed
to
fall
with
all
the
force
of
a
blow
from
a
club
and
everybody
looked
at
the
speaker
mean
that
he
has
a
weak
head
continued
trouche
only
got
to
look
at
his
eyes
i
may
tell
you
that
i
do
feel
particularly
easy
myself
there
was
a
man
at
besançon
who
adored
his
daughter

he
murdered
her
one
night
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
master

a
long
time
past

rose

frightful
cried
madame
rougon
i
fear
you
may
be
right
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
had
a
most
extraordinary
expression
on
his
face
he
never
had
very
sharp
wits
ah

poor
dear
promise
to
confide
everything
to
me
i
shall
not

quietly
after

listen

extravagant
conduct

husband
part

hesitate

run
any
further
risk

must
be
placed
in
confinement
after
this
speech
she
went
off
when
trouche
was
again
alone
with
abbé
faujas
he
gave
one
of
those
unpleasant
grins
that
exposed
his
black
teeth
to
view
landlady
will
owe
me
a
big
taper
he
said
will
be
able
to
kick
about
at
nights
as
much
as
she
likes
the
priest
with
his
face
quite
ashy
and
his
eyes
turned
to
the
ground
made
no
reply
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
off
to
read
his
breviary
under
the
arbour
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
xviii
on
sundays
mouret
like
many
of
the
other
retired
traders
of
plassans
used
to
take
a
stroll
about
the
town
it
was
on
sundays
only
that
he
now
emerged
from
that
lonely
seclusion
in
which
he
buried
himself
overcome
by
a
sort
of
shame
and
his
sunday
outing
was
gone
through
quite
mechanically
in
the
morning
he
shaved
himself
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
brushed
his
coat
and
hat
then
after
breakfast
without
quite
knowing
how
he
found
himself
in
the
street
walking
along
slowly
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
looking
very
sedate
and
neat
as
he
was
leaving
his
house
one
sunday
he
saw
rose
talking
with
much
animation
to
monsieur
rastoil
cook
on
the
pathway
of
the
rue
balande
the
two
servants
became
silent
when
they
caught
sight
of
him
they
looked
at
him
with
such
a
peculiar
expression
that
he
felt
behind
him
to
ascertain
whether
his
handkerchief
was
hanging
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
reached
the
place
of
the
he
turned
his
head
looked
back
and
saw
them
still
standing
in
the
same
place
rose
was
imitating
the
reeling
of
a
drunken
man
while
the
president
cook
was
laughing
loudly
am
walking
too
quickly
and
they
are
making
fun
of
me
thought
mouret
he
thereupon
slackened
his
pace
as
he
passed
through
the
rue
de
la
banne
towards
the
market
the
shopkeepers
ran
to
their
doors
and
watched
him
curiously
he
gave
a
little
nod
to
the
butcher
who
looked
confused
and
did
not
return
the
salutation
the
baker
wife
to
whom
he
raised
his
hat
seemed
quite
alarmed
and
hastily
stepped
backwards
the
greengrocer
the
pastrycook
and
the
grocer
pointed
him
out
to
each
other
from
opposite
sides
of
the
street
as
he
went
along
there
was
ever
excitement
behind
him
people
clustered
together
in
groups
and
a
great
deal
of
talking
mingled
with
laughs
and
grins
ensued
you
notice
how
quickly
he
was
walking
indeed
when
he
wanted
to
stride
across
the
gutter
he
almost
jumped
is
said
that
they
are
all
like
that
felt
quite
frightened
why
is
he
allowed
to
come
out
it
ought
to
be
permitted
mouret
was
beginning
to
feel
timid
and
dared
not
venture
to
look
round
again
he
experienced
a
vague
uneasiness
though
he
could
not
feel
quite
sure
that
it
was
about
himself
that
the
people
were
all
talking
he
quickened
his
steps
and
began
to
swing
his
arms
about
he
regretted
that
he
had
put
on
his
old
overcoat
a
one
and
no
longer
of
a
fashionable
cut
when
he
reached
the
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
boldly
strode
into
the
midst
of
the
greengrocers
stalls
the
mere
sight
of
him
caused
quite
a
commotion
there
all
the
housewives
of
plassans
formed
in
a
line
about
his
path
the
stood
up
by
their
stalls
with
their
hands
on
their
hips
and
stared
hard
at
him
people
even
pushed
one
another
to
get
a
sight
of
him
and
some
of
the
women
mounted
on
to
the
benches
in
the
mouret
still
further
quickened
his
steps
and
tried
to
disengage
himself
from
the
crowd
not
as
yet
able
to
believe
that
it
was
he
who
was
causing
all
this
excitement
anyone
would
think
that
his
arms
were
windmill
sails
said
a
who
was
selling
fruit
flies
on
like
a
shot
he
nearly
upset
my
stall
exclaimed
another
woman
a
greengrocer
him
stop
him
the
millers
cried
facetiously
then
mouret
overcome
by
curiosity
halted
and
rose
on
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
imagined
that
someone
had
just
been
detected
thieving
but
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
broke
out
from
the
crowd
and
there
were
shouts
and
hisses
all
sorts
of
calls
and
cries
no
harm
in
him
do
hurt
him
i
not
so
sure
of
that
i
should
like
to
trust
myself
too
near
him
he
gets
up
in
the
night
and
strangles
people
certainly
looks
a
bad
one
it
come
upon
him
suddenly
indeed
all
at
once
and
he
used
to
be
so
kind
and
gentle
going
away
all
this
distresses
me
here
are
the
three
sous
for
the
turnips
mouret
had
just
recognised
olympe
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
women
and
he
went
towards
her
she
had
been
buying
some
magnificent
peaches
which
she
carried
in
a
very
handbag
and
she
was
evidently
relating
some
very
moving
story
for
all
the
gossips
around
her
were
breaking
out
into
exclamations
and
clasping
their
hands
with
expressions
of
pity
said
she
caught
her
by
the
hair
and
he
would
have
cut
her
throat
with
a
razor
which
was
lying
on
the
chest
of
drawers
if
we
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
murder
but
do
say
anything
to
her
about
it
it
would
only
bring
her
more
trouble
trouble
asked
mouret
in
amazement
the
listeners
hurried
away
and
olympe
assumed
an
expression
of
careful
watchfulness
as
in
her
turn
she
warily
slipped
off
saying
excite
yourself
monsieur
mouret
you
had
better
go
back
home
mouret
took
refuge
in
a
little
lane
that
led
to
the
cours
sauvaire
thereupon
the
shouts
increased
in
violence
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
pursued
by
the
angry
uproar
of
the
is
the
matter
with
them
he
wondered
it
be
me
that
they
were
jeering
at
but
i
never
heard
my
name
mentioned
something
out
of
the
common
must
have
happened
he
then
took
off
his
hat
and
examined
it
imagining
that
perhaps
some
street
lad
had
thrown
a
handful
of
mud
at
it
it
was
all
right
however
and
there
was
nothing
fastened
on
to
his
this
examination
soothed
him
a
little
and
he
resumed
his
sedate
walk
through
the
silent
lane
and
quietly
turned
on
to
the
cours
sauvaire
the
usual
groups
of
friends
were
sitting
on
the
benches
there
here
mouret
cried
the
retired
captain
with
an
expression
of
great
astonishment
the
liveliest
curiosity
became
manifest
on
the
sleepy
faces
of
the
others
they
stretched
out
their
necks
without
rising
from
their
seats
while
mouret
stood
in
front
of
them
they
examined
him
minutely
from
head
to
foot
you
are
taking
a
little
stroll
said
the
captain
who
seemed
the
boldest
just
a
short
stroll
replied
mouret
in
a
listless
fashion
a
very
fine
day
the
company
exchanged
meaning
smiles
they
were
feeling
chilly
and
the
sky
had
just
become
overcast
fine
said
a
retired
tanner
are
easily
pleased
it
is
true
however
that
you
are
already
wearing
winter
clothes
what
a
funny
overcoat
that
is
of
yours
the
smiles
now
grew
into
grins
and
titters
a
sudden
idea
seemed
to
strike
mouret
look
and
tell
me
said
he
suddenly
turning
round
i
got
a
sun
on
my
back
the
retired
could
no
longer
keep
serious
but
burst
into
loud
laughter
the
captain
who
was
the
jester
of
the
company
winked
sun
he
asked
i
can
only
see
a
moon
the
others
shook
with
laughter
they
thought
the
captain
excessively
witty
moon
said
mouret
kind
enough
to
remove
it
it
has
caused
me
much
inconvenience
the
captain
gave
him
three
or
four
taps
on
the
back
and
then
exclaimed
you
are
rid
of
it
now
but
it
must
indeed
be
extremely
inconvenient
to
have
a
moon
on
one
back
you
are
not
looking
very
well
am
not
very
well
mouret
replied
in
his
listless
indifferent
way
then
imagining
that
he
heard
a
titter
he
added
i
am
very
well
taken
care
of
at
home
my
wife
is
very
kind
and
attentive
and
quite
spoils
me
but
i
need
rest
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
do
come
out
now
as
i
used
to
do
directly
i
am
better
i
shall
look
after
business
again
they
say
it
is
your
wife
who
is
not
very
well
interrupted
the
retired
tanner
bluntly
wife
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
her
it
is
a
pack
of
falsehoods
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
her
nothing
at
all
people
say
things
against
us
because
because
we
keep
quietly
at
home
ill
indeed
my
wife
she
is
very
strong
and
never
even
has
so
much
the
matter
with
her
as
as
a
headache
he
went
on
speaking
in
short
sentences
stammering
and
hesitating
in
the
uneasy
way
of
a
man
who
is
telling
falsehoods
full
too
of
the
embarrassment
of
a
whilom
gossip
who
has
become
the
retired
traders
shook
their
heads
with
pitying
looks
and
the
captain
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
finger
a
former
hatter
of
the
suburbs
who
had
scrutinised
mouret
from
his
cravat
to
the
bottom
button
of
his
overcoat
was
now
absorbed
in
the
examination
of
his
boots
the
lace
of
the
one
on
the
left
foot
had
come
undone
and
this
seemed
to
the
hatter
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
he
nudged
his
elbows
and
winked
as
he
called
their
attention
to
the
loosened
lace
soon
the
whole
bench
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
but
the
lace
it
was
the
last
proof
the
men
shrugged
their
shoulders
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
imply
that
they
had
lost
their
last
spark
of
hope
said
the
captain
in
a
paternal
fashion
up
your
mouret
glanced
at
his
feet
but
did
not
seem
to
understand
and
he
went
on
talking
then
as
no
one
replied
he
became
silent
and
after
standing
there
for
a
moment
or
two
longer
he
quietly
continued
his
walk
will
fall
i
sure
exclaimed
the
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
that
he
might
keep
mouret
longer
in
view
when
mouret
got
to
the
end
of
the
cours
sauvaire
and
passed
in
front
of
the
young
men
club
he
was
again
greeted
with
the
low
laughs
which
had
followed
him
since
he
had
set
foot
out
of
doors
he
could
distinctly
see
séverin
rastoil
who
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
club
pointing
him
out
to
a
group
of
young
men
clearly
he
thought
it
was
himself
who
was
thus
providing
sport
for
the
town
he
bent
his
head
and
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
fear
which
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
as
he
hastily
stepped
past
the
houses
just
as
he
was
about
to
turn
into
the
rue
canquoin
he
heard
a
noise
behind
him
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
three
lads
following
him
two
of
them
were
big
boys
while
the
third
was
a
very
little
one
with
a
serious
face
the
latter
was
holding
in
his
hand
a
dirty
orange
which
he
had
picked
out
of
the
gutter
mouret
made
his
way
along
the
rue
canquoin
and
then
crossing
the
place
des
récollets
he
reached
the
rue
de
la
banne
the
lads
were
still
following
him
you
want
your
ears
pulled
he
called
out
suddenly
stepping
up
to
them
they
dashed
on
one
side
shouting
and
laughing
and
made
their
escape
on
their
hands
and
knees
mouret
turned
very
red
realising
that
he
was
an
object
of
ridicule
he
felt
a
perfect
fear
of
crossing
the
place
of
the
and
passing
in
front
of
the
rougons
windows
with
a
following
of
whom
he
could
hear
increasing
in
numbers
and
boldness
behind
him
as
he
went
on
he
was
obliged
to
step
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
his
who
was
returning
from
vespers
with
madame
de
condamin
wolf
cried
the
lads
mouret
with
perspiration
breaking
out
on
his
brow
and
his
feet
stumbling
against
the
overheard
old
madame
rougon
say
to
the
wife
of
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
there
he
is
the
scoundrel
it
is
disgraceful
we
ca
tolerate
it
much
longer
thereupon
mouret
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
from
setting
off
at
a
run
with
swinging
arms
and
a
look
of
distraction
upon
his
face
he
rushed
into
the
rue
balande
while
some
ten
or
a
dozen
dashed
after
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
all
the
shopkeepers
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
the
the
promenaders
of
the
cours
the
young
men
from
the
club
the
rougons
the
condamins
all
the
people
of
plassans
in
fact
were
surging
onwards
behind
his
back
breaking
out
into
laughs
and
jeers
as
he
sped
up
the
hilly
street
the
lads
stamped
and
slid
over
the
pavement
making
indeed
as
much
noise
in
that
usually
quiet
neighbourhood
as
a
pack
of
hounds
might
have
made
him
they
screamed
what
a
scarecrow
he
looks
in
that
overcoat
of
his
of
you
go
round
by
the
rue
taravelle
and
then
you
nab
him
along
cut
along
as
hard
as
you
can
go
mouret
now
quite
frantic
made
a
desperate
rush
towards
his
door
but
his
foot
slipped
and
he
tumbled
upon
the
where
he
lay
for
a
few
moments
utterly
overcome
the
lads
afraid
lest
he
should
kick
out
at
them
formed
a
circle
around
and
vented
screams
of
triumph
while
the
smallest
of
them
gravely
stepping
forward
threw
the
rotten
orange
at
mouret
it
flattened
itself
against
his
left
eye
he
rose
up
with
difficulty
and
went
in
to
his
house
without
attempting
to
wipe
himself
rose
was
forced
to
come
out
with
a
broom
and
drive
the
young
ragamuffins
away
from
that
sunday
forward
all
plassans
was
convinced
that
mouret
was
a
lunatic
who
ought
to
be
placed
under
restraint
the
most
surprising
statements
were
made
in
support
of
this
belief
it
was
said
for
instance
that
he
shut
himself
up
for
days
together
in
a
perfectly
empty
room
which
had
not
been
touched
with
a
broom
for
a
whole
year
and
those
who
circulated
this
story
vouched
for
its
truth
as
they
had
it
they
said
from
mouret
own
cook
the
accounts
differed
as
to
what
he
did
in
that
empty
room
the
cook
said
that
he
pretended
to
be
dead
a
statement
which
thrilled
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
horror
the
firmly
believed
that
he
kept
a
coffin
concealed
in
the
room
laid
himself
at
full
length
in
it
with
his
eyes
open
and
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
remained
like
that
from
morning
till
night
attack
had
been
threatening
him
for
a
long
time
past
olympe
remarked
in
every
shop
she
entered
was
brooding
in
him
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
very
melancholy
and
hiding
in
corners
just
like
an
animal
you
know
that
feels
ill
the
very
first
day
i
set
foot
in
the
house
i
said
to
my
husband
the
landlord
seems
to
be
in
a
bad
way
his
eyes
were
quite
yellow
and
he
had
such
a
queer
look
about
him
afterwards
he
went
on
in
the
strangest
way
he
had
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
whims
and
crotchets
he
used
to
count
every
lump
of
sugar
and
lock
everything
up
even
the
bread
he
was
so
dreadfully
miserly
that
his
poor
wife
had
even
a
pair
of
boots
to
put
on
ah
poor
thing
she
has
a
dreadful
time
of
it
and
i
pity
her
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
imagine
the
life
she
leads
with
a
madman
who
ca
even
behave
decently
at
table
he
throws
his
napkin
away
in
the
middle
of
dinner
and
stalks
off
looking
stupefied
after
having
made
a
horrible
mess
in
his
plate
and
such
a
temper
he
has
too
he
used
to
make
the
most
terrible
scenes
just
because
the
mustard
pot
was
in
its
right
place
but
now
he
does
speak
at
all
though
he
glares
like
a
wild
beast
and
springs
at
people
throats
without
uttering
a
word
ah
i
could
tell
you
some
strange
stories
if
i
liked
when
she
had
thus
excited
her
listeners
curiosity
and
they
began
to
press
her
with
questions
she
added
no
it
is
no
business
of
mine
madame
mouret
is
a
perfect
saint
and
bears
her
suffering
like
a
true
christian
she
has
her
own
ideas
on
the
matter
and
one
must
respect
them
but
would
you
believe
it
he
tried
to
cut
her
throat
with
a
razor
the
story
she
told
was
always
the
same
but
it
never
failed
to
produce
a
great
effect
fists
were
clenched
and
women
talked
of
strangling
mouret
if
any
incredulous
person
shook
his
head
he
was
put
to
confusion
by
a
summons
to
explain
the
dreadful
scenes
which
took
place
every
night
only
a
madman
people
said
was
capable
of
flying
in
that
way
at
his
wife
throat
the
moment
she
went
to
bed
there
was
a
spice
of
mystery
in
the
affair
which
helped
materially
to
spread
the
story
about
the
town
for
nearly
a
month
the
rumours
went
on
gaining
strength
yet
in
spite
of
olympe
tragical
gossipings
peace
had
been
restored
at
the
mourets
and
the
nights
now
passed
in
quietness
marthe
exhibited
much
nervous
impatience
when
her
friends
without
openly
speaking
on
the
subject
advised
her
to
be
very
careful
will
only
go
your
own
way
i
suppose
said
rose
see
he
will
begin
again
and
we
shall
find
you
murdered
one
of
these
fine
mornings
madame
rougon
now
ostentatiously
called
at
the
house
every
other
day
she
entered
it
with
an
air
of
extreme
uneasiness
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
she
asked
rose
has
anything
happened
then
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
daughter
she
kissed
her
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
with
a
great
show
of
affection
as
though
she
had
been
afraid
that
she
might
not
find
her
alive
she
passed
the
most
dreadful
nights
she
said
she
trembled
at
every
ring
of
the
bell
imagining
that
it
was
the
signal
of
the
tidings
of
some
dreadful
calamity
and
she
no
longer
had
any
pleasure
in
living
when
marthe
told
her
that
she
was
in
no
danger
whatever
she
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
admiration
and
exclaimed
are
a
perfect
angel
if
i
were
not
here
to
look
after
you
you
would
allow
yourself
to
be
murdered
without
raising
even
a
sigh
but
make
yourself
easy
i
am
watching
over
you
and
am
taking
all
precautions
the
first
time
your
husband
raises
his
little
finger
against
you
he
will
hear
from
me
she
did
not
explain
herself
any
further
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
she
had
visited
every
official
in
plassans
and
had
in
this
way
confidentially
related
her
daughter
troubles
to
the
mayor
the
and
the
presiding
judge
of
the
tribunal
making
them
promise
to
observe
absolute
secrecy
about
the
matter
is
a
mother
in
despair
who
tells
you
this
she
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
am
giving
the
honour
and
reputation
of
my
poor
child
into
your
keeping
my
husband
would
take
to
his
bed
if
there
were
to
be
a
public
scandal
but
i
ca
wait
till
there
is
some
fatal
catastrophe
advise
me
and
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
the
officials
showed
her
the
greatest
sympathy
and
kindness
they
did
their
best
to
reassure
her
they
promised
to
keep
a
careful
watch
over
madame
mouret
without
in
any
way
letting
it
be
known
and
to
take
some
active
step
at
the
slightest
sign
of
danger
in
her
interviews
with
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
and
monsieur
rastoil
she
drew
their
especial
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
they
were
her
immediate
neighbours
they
would
be
able
to
interfere
at
once
in
the
event
of
anything
going
wrong
this
story
of
a
lunatic
in
his
senses
who
awaited
the
stroke
of
midnight
to
become
mad
imparted
much
interest
to
the
meetings
of
the
guests
in
mouret
garden
they
showed
great
alacrity
in
going
to
greet
abbé
faujas
the
priest
came
downstairs
at
four
and
did
the
honours
of
the
arbour
with
much
urbanity
but
in
talking
he
persisted
in
keeping
in
the
background
merely
nodding
in
answer
to
what
was
said
to
him
for
the
first
few
days
only
indirect
allusions
were
made
to
the
drama
which
was
being
acted
in
the
house
but
one
tuesday
monsieur
maffre
who
was
gazing
at
it
with
an
uneasy
expression
fixing
his
eyes
upon
one
of
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
ventured
to
ask
is
the
room
is
it
then
in
low
tones
the
two
parties
began
to
discuss
the
strange
story
which
was
exciting
the
neighbourhood
the
priest
made
some
vague
remarks
it
was
very
sad
and
much
to
be
regretted
said
he
and
then
he
pitied
everybody
without
venturing
to
say
anything
more
explicit
you
doctor
asked
madame
de
condamin
of
doctor
porquier
who
are
the
family
doctor
what
do
you
think
about
it
all
doctor
porquier
shook
his
head
for
some
time
before
making
any
reply
he
at
first
affected
a
discreet
reserve
is
a
very
delicate
matter
he
muttered
mouret
is
not
robust
and
as
for
monsieur
mouret
have
seen
madame
rougon
said
the
is
very
uneasy
has
always
been
obnoxious
to
her
monsieur
de
condamin
exclaimed
bluntly
met
mouret
myself
at
the
club
the
other
day
and
he
gave
me
a
beating
at
piquet
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
as
sensible
as
ever
the
good
man
was
never
a
solomon
you
know
have
not
said
that
he
is
mad
in
the
common
interpretation
of
the
word
said
the
doctor
thinking
that
he
was
being
attacked
neither
will
i
say
that
i
think
it
prudent
to
allow
him
to
remain
at
large
this
statement
caused
considerable
emotion
and
monsieur
rastoil
instinctively
glanced
at
the
wall
which
separated
the
two
gardens
every
face
was
turned
towards
the
doctor
once
knew
he
continued
charming
lady
who
kept
up
a
large
establishment
giving
receiving
the
most
distinguished
members
of
society
and
showing
much
sense
and
wit
in
her
conversation
well
when
that
lady
retired
to
her
bedroom
she
locked
herself
in
and
spent
a
part
of
the
night
in
crawling
round
the
room
on
her
hands
and
knees
barking
like
a
dog
the
people
in
the
house
long
imagined
that
she
really
had
a
dog
in
the
room
with
her
this
lady
was
an
example
of
what
we
doctors
call
lucid
madness
abbé
surin
face
was
wreathed
with
twinkling
smiles
as
he
glanced
at
monsieur
rastoil
daughters
who
appeared
much
amused
by
this
story
of
a
fashionable
lady
turning
herself
into
a
dog
doctor
porquier
blew
his
nose
very
gravely
could
give
you
a
score
of
other
similar
instances
he
continued
people
who
appeared
to
be
in
full
possession
of
their
senses
and
who
yet
committed
the
most
extravagant
actions
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
alone
my
part
said
abbé
bourrette
once
had
a
very
strange
penitent
she
had
a
mania
for
killing
flies
and
could
never
see
one
without
feeling
an
irresistible
desire
to
capture
it
she
used
to
keep
them
at
home
strung
upon
knitting
needles
when
she
came
to
confess
she
would
weep
bitterly
and
accuse
herself
of
the
death
of
the
poor
creatures
and
believe
that
she
was
damned
but
i
could
never
correct
her
of
the
habit
this
story
was
very
well
received
and
even
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
and
monsieur
rastoil
themselves
condescended
to
smile
is
no
great
harm
done
said
the
doctor
long
as
one
confines
one
self
to
killing
flies
but
the
conduct
of
all
lucid
madmen
is
not
so
innocent
as
that
some
of
them
torture
their
families
by
some
concealed
vice
which
has
reached
the
degree
of
a
mania
there
are
other
wretched
ones
who
drink
and
give
themselves
up
to
secret
debauchery
or
who
steal
because
they
ca
help
stealing
or
who
are
mad
with
pride
or
jealousy
or
ambition
they
are
able
to
control
themselves
in
public
to
carry
out
the
most
complicated
schemes
and
projects
to
converse
rationally
and
without
giving
any
one
any
reason
to
suspect
their
mental
weakness
but
as
soon
as
they
get
back
to
their
own
private
life
and
are
alone
with
their
victims
they
surrender
themselves
to
their
delirious
ideas
and
become
brutal
savages
if
they
do
murder
straight
out
they
do
it
gradually
now
what
about
monsieur
mouret
asked
madame
de
condamin
mouret
has
always
been
a
teasing
restless
despotic
sort
of
man
his
cerebral
derangement
has
increased
with
his
years
i
should
not
hesitate
now
to
class
him
amongst
dangerous
madmen
i
had
a
patient
who
used
to
shut
herself
up
just
as
he
does
in
an
unoccupied
room
and
spend
the
whole
day
in
contriving
the
most
abominable
actions
doctor
if
that
is
your
opinion
you
ought
to
proffer
your
advice
exclaimed
monsieur
rastoil
ought
to
warn
those
who
are
concerned
doctor
porquier
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
we
will
see
about
it
he
said
smiling
again
with
his
fashionable
doctor
smile
it
should
be
necessary
and
matters
should
become
serious
i
will
do
my
duty
cried
monsieur
de
condamin
satirically
greatest
lunatics
are
not
those
who
have
the
reputation
of
being
so
no
brain
is
sound
for
a
the
doctor
here
has
just
been
reciting
to
us
a
page
out
of
a
book
on
lucid
madness
which
i
have
read
and
which
is
as
interesting
as
a
novel
abbé
faujas
had
been
listening
with
curiosity
though
he
had
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
then
as
soon
as
there
was
a
pause
he
remarked
that
their
talk
about
mad
people
had
a
depressing
effect
upon
the
ladies
and
suggested
that
the
subject
should
be
changed
everybody
curiosity
was
fully
awakened
however
and
the
two
sets
of
guests
began
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
upon
mouret
behaviour
the
latter
now
came
out
into
the
garden
for
an
hour
a
day
while
the
faujases
remained
at
table
with
his
wife
directly
he
appeared
there
he
came
under
the
active
surveillance
of
the
rastoils
and
the
frequenters
of
the
he
could
not
stand
for
a
moment
in
front
of
a
bed
of
vegetables
or
examine
a
plant
or
even
make
a
gesture
of
any
sort
without
exciting
in
the
gardens
on
his
right
and
left
the
most
unfavourable
comments
everyone
was
turning
against
him
monsieur
de
condamin
was
the
only
person
who
still
defended
him
one
day
the
fair
octavie
said
to
him
as
they
were
at
luncheon
difference
can
it
make
to
you
whether
mouret
is
mad
or
not
me
my
dear
absolutely
none
he
said
in
astonishment
well
then
allow
that
he
is
mad
since
everyone
says
he
is
i
do
know
why
you
always
persist
in
holding
a
contrary
opinion
to
your
wife
it
wo
prove
to
your
advantage
my
dear
have
the
intelligence
at
plassans
not
to
be
too
intelligent
monsieur
de
condamin
smiled
are
right
my
dear
as
you
always
are
he
said
gallantly
know
that
i
have
put
my
fortune
in
your
hands
do
wait
dinner
for
me
i
am
going
to
ride
to
to
have
a
look
at
some
timber
they
are
felling
then
he
left
the
room
biting
the
end
off
a
cigar
madame
de
condamin
was
well
aware
that
he
had
a
flame
for
a
young
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
of
but
she
was
very
tolerant
and
had
even
saved
him
twice
from
the
consequences
of
scandalous
intrigues
on
his
side
he
felt
very
easy
about
his
wife
he
knew
that
she
was
much
too
prudent
to
give
cause
for
scandal
at
plassans
would
never
guess
how
mouret
spends
his
time
in
that
room
where
he
shuts
himself
up
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
said
the
next
morning
when
he
called
at
the
is
counting
all
the
s
in
the
bible
he
is
afraid
of
making
any
mistake
about
the
matter
and
he
has
already
recommenced
counting
them
for
the
third
time
ah
you
were
quite
right
he
is
cracked
from
top
to
bottom
from
this
time
forward
monsieur
de
condamin
was
very
hard
upon
mouret
he
even
exaggerated
matters
and
used
all
his
skill
to
invent
absurd
stories
to
scare
the
rastoils
but
it
was
monsieur
maffre
whom
he
made
his
special
victim
he
told
him
one
day
that
he
had
seen
mouret
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
street
in
a
state
of
complete
nudity
having
only
a
woman
cap
on
his
head
and
bowing
to
the
empty
air
another
day
he
asserted
with
amazing
assurance
that
he
had
seen
mouret
dancing
like
a
savage
in
a
little
wood
three
leagues
away
and
when
the
magistrate
seemed
to
doubt
this
story
he
appeared
to
be
vexed
and
declared
that
mouret
might
very
easily
have
got
down
out
of
his
house
by
the
without
being
noticed
the
frequenters
of
the
smiled
but
the
next
morning
the
rastoils
cook
spread
these
extraordinary
stories
about
the
town
where
the
legend
of
the
man
who
beat
his
wife
was
assuming
extraordinary
proportions
one
afternoon
aurélie
the
elder
of
monsieur
rastoil
two
daughters
related
with
a
blushing
face
how
on
the
previous
night
having
gone
to
look
out
of
her
window
about
midnight
she
had
seen
their
neighbour
promenading
about
his
garden
carrying
a
big
altar
candle
monsieur
de
condamin
thought
the
girl
was
making
fun
of
him
but
she
gave
the
most
minute
details
held
the
candle
in
his
left
hand
and
he
knelt
down
on
the
ground
and
dragged
himself
along
on
his
knees
sobbing
as
he
did
so
it
be
possible
that
he
has
committed
a
murder
and
has
buried
the
body
of
his
victim
in
his
garden
exclaimed
monsieur
maffre
who
had
turned
quite
pale
then
the
two
sets
of
guests
agreed
to
watch
some
evening
till
midnight
if
necessary
to
clear
the
matter
up
the
following
night
indeed
they
kept
on
the
alert
in
both
gardens
but
mouret
did
not
appear
three
nights
were
wasted
in
the
same
way
the
party
was
going
to
abandon
the
watch
and
madame
de
condamin
declared
that
she
could
not
stay
any
longer
under
the
chestnut
trees
where
it
was
so
dreadfully
dark
when
all
at
once
a
light
was
seen
flickering
through
the
inky
blackness
of
the
ground
floor
of
mouret
house
when
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
attention
was
drawn
to
this
he
slipped
into
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
to
invite
the
rastoils
to
come
on
to
his
terrace
which
overlooked
the
neighbouring
garden
the
presiding
judge
who
was
on
the
watch
with
his
daughters
behind
the
cascade
hesitated
for
a
moment
reflecting
whether
he
might
not
compromise
himself
politically
by
going
to
the
in
this
way
but
as
the
night
was
very
black
and
his
daughter
aurélie
was
most
anxious
to
have
the
truth
of
her
report
manifested
he
followed
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
with
stealthy
steps
through
the
darkness
it
was
in
this
manner
that
a
representative
of
legitimacy
at
plassans
for
the
first
time
entered
the
grounds
of
a
bonapartist
official
make
a
noise
whispered
the
over
the
terrace
there
monsieur
rastoil
and
his
daughters
found
doctor
porquier
and
madame
de
condamin
and
her
husband
the
darkness
was
so
dense
that
they
exchanged
salutations
without
being
able
to
see
one
another
then
they
all
held
their
breath
mouret
had
just
appeared
upon
the
steps
with
a
candle
which
was
stuck
in
a
great
kitchen
candlestick
see
he
has
got
a
candle
whispered
aurélie
no
one
dissented
the
fact
was
quite
incontrovertible
mouret
certainly
was
carrying
a
candle
he
came
slowly
down
the
steps
turned
to
the
left
and
then
stood
motionless
before
a
bed
of
lettuces
then
he
raised
his
candle
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
plants
his
face
looked
quite
yellow
amidst
the
black
night
a
dreadful
face
exclaimed
madame
de
condamin
shall
dream
of
it
i
certain
is
he
asleep
doctor
no
replied
doctor
porquier
is
not
a
somnambulist
he
is
wide
awake
do
you
notice
how
fixed
his
gaze
is
observe
too
the
abruptness
of
his
movements
hush
interrupted
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
require
a
lecture
just
now
the
most
complete
silence
then
fell
mouret
had
stridden
over
the
and
was
kneeling
in
the
midst
of
the
lettuces
he
held
his
candle
down
and
began
searching
along
the
trenches
underneath
the
spreading
leaves
of
the
plants
every
now
and
then
he
made
a
slight
examination
and
seemed
to
be
crushing
something
and
stamping
it
into
the
ground
this
went
on
for
nearly
half
an
hour
is
crying
it
is
just
as
i
told
you
aurélie
complacently
remarked
is
really
very
terrifying
madame
de
condamin
exclaimed
nervously
let
us
go
back
into
the
house
mouret
dropped
his
candle
and
it
went
out
they
could
hear
him
uttering
exclamations
of
annoyance
as
he
went
back
up
the
steps
stumbling
against
them
in
the
dark
the
rastoil
girls
broke
out
into
little
cries
of
terror
and
did
not
quite
recover
from
their
fright
till
they
were
again
in
the
brightly
lighted
where
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
insisted
upon
the
company
refreshing
themselves
with
some
tea
and
biscuits
madame
de
condamin
who
was
still
trembling
with
alarm
huddled
up
on
a
couch
said
with
a
touching
smile
that
she
had
never
felt
so
overcome
before
not
even
on
the
morning
when
she
had
had
the
reprehensible
curiosity
to
go
and
see
a
criminal
executed
is
strange
remarked
monsieur
rastoil
who
had
been
buried
in
thought
for
a
moment
or
two
mouret
looked
as
if
he
were
searching
for
slugs
amongst
his
lettuces
the
gardens
are
quite
ravaged
by
them
and
i
have
been
told
that
they
can
only
be
satisfactorily
exterminated
in
the
indeed
cried
monsieur
de
condamin
you
suppose
he
troubles
himself
about
slugs
do
people
go
hunting
for
slugs
with
a
candle
no
i
agree
with
monsieur
maffre
in
thinking
that
there
is
some
crime
at
the
bottom
of
the
matter
did
this
man
mouret
ever
have
a
servant
who
disappeared
mysteriously
there
ought
to
be
an
inquiry
made
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
thought
that
his
friend
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
was
theorising
a
little
further
than
the
facts
warranted
he
took
a
sip
at
his
tea
and
said
no
my
dear
sir
he
is
mad
and
has
extraordinary
fancies
but
that
is
all
it
is
quite
bad
enough
as
it
is
he
then
took
a
plate
of
biscuits
handed
it
to
monsieur
daughter
with
a
gallant
bow
and
after
putting
it
down
again
continued
to
think
this
wretched
man
has
mixed
himself
up
in
politics
i
do
want
to
insinuate
anything
against
your
alliance
with
the
republicans
my
dear
judge
but
you
must
allow
that
in
mouret
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
had
a
very
peculiar
supporter
monsieur
rastoil
who
had
become
very
grave
made
a
vague
gesture
without
saying
anything
he
still
busies
himself
with
these
matters
it
is
politics
perhaps
which
have
turned
his
brain
said
the
fair
octavie
as
she
delicately
wiped
her
lips
say
he
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
the
approaching
elections
do
they
my
dear
she
addressed
this
question
to
her
husband
casting
a
glance
at
him
as
she
spoke
is
quite
bursting
over
the
matter
cried
monsieur
de
condamin
declares
that
he
can
entirely
control
the
election
and
can
have
a
shoemaker
returned
if
he
chooses
are
exaggerating
said
doctor
porquier
no
longer
has
the
influence
he
used
to
have
the
whole
town
jeers
at
him
you
are
mistaken
if
he
chooses
he
can
lead
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
and
a
great
number
of
villages
to
the
poll
he
is
mad
it
is
true
but
that
is
a
recommendation
i
myself
consider
him
still
a
very
sensible
person
for
a
republican
this
attempt
at
wit
met
with
distinct
success
monsieur
daughters
broke
out
into
laughs
and
the
presiding
judge
himself
nodded
his
head
in
approval
he
threw
off
his
serious
expression
and
without
looking
at
the
he
said
has
not
rendered
us
perhaps
the
services
we
had
a
right
to
expect
but
a
shoemaker
would
be
really
too
disgraceful
for
plassans
then
as
though
he
wanted
to
prevent
any
further
remarks
on
the
subject
he
added
quickly
it
is
one
this
is
quite
an
orgie
we
are
having
my
dear
we
are
all
very
much
obliged
to
you
madame
de
condamin
wrapped
her
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
contrived
to
have
the
last
word
she
said
really
must
not
let
the
election
be
controlled
by
a
man
who
goes
and
kneels
down
in
the
middle
of
a
bed
of
lettuces
after
twelve
at
night
that
night
became
quite
historical
and
monsieur
de
condamin
derived
much
amusement
from
relating
the
details
of
what
had
occurred
to
monsieur
de
bourdeu
monsieur
maffre
and
the
priests
who
had
not
seen
mouret
with
his
candle
three
days
later
all
the
neighbourhood
was
asserting
that
the
madman
who
beat
his
wife
had
been
seen
walking
about
with
his
head
enveloped
in
a
sheet
meantime
the
afternoon
assemblies
under
the
arbour
were
much
exercised
by
the
possible
candidature
of
mouret
radical
shoemaker
they
laughed
as
they
studied
each
other
demeanour
it
was
a
sort
of
political
certain
confidential
statements
of
his
friend
the
presiding
judge
induced
monsieur
de
bourdeu
to
believe
that
a
tacit
understanding
might
be
arrived
at
between
the
and
the
moderate
opposition
to
promote
the
candidature
of
himself
and
thus
inflict
a
crushing
defeat
upon
the
republicans
possessed
by
this
idea
he
waxed
more
and
more
sarcastic
against
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
and
made
the
most
of
the
latter
blunders
in
the
chamber
monsieur
delangre
who
only
called
at
long
intervals
alleging
the
pressure
of
his
municipal
duties
as
an
excuse
for
his
infrequent
appearance
smiled
softly
at
each
fresh
sally
of
the
only
got
to
bury
the
marquis
now
your
reverence
he
said
one
day
in
abbé
faujas
ear
madame
de
condamin
who
heard
him
turned
her
head
and
laid
her
finger
upon
her
lips
with
a
pretty
look
of
mischief
abbé
faujas
now
allowed
politics
to
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
he
even
occasionally
expressed
an
opinion
in
favour
of
the
union
of
all
honest
and
religious
men
thereupon
all
present
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
monsieur
rastoil
monsieur
de
bourdeu
and
even
monsieur
maffre
grew
quite
warm
in
their
expressions
of
desire
for
such
an
agreement
it
would
be
so
very
easy
they
said
for
men
with
a
stake
in
the
country
to
come
to
an
understanding
together
to
work
for
the
firm
establishment
of
the
great
principles
without
which
no
society
could
hold
together
then
the
conversation
turned
upon
property
and
family
and
religion
sometimes
mouret
name
was
mentioned
and
monsieur
de
condamin
once
said
never
let
my
wife
come
here
without
feeling
uneasy
i
am
really
getting
alarmed
you
will
see
some
strange
things
happen
at
the
next
elections
if
that
man
is
still
at
liberty
trouche
did
his
best
to
frighten
abbé
faujas
during
the
interviews
which
he
had
with
him
every
morning
he
told
him
the
most
alarming
stories
the
working
men
of
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
said
he
were
showing
too
much
interest
in
mouret
they
talked
of
coming
to
see
him
of
judging
his
condition
for
themselves
and
taking
his
advice
as
a
rule
the
priest
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
one
day
trouche
came
away
from
him
looking
quite
delighted
he
went
off
to
olympe
and
kissed
her
exclaiming
time
my
dear
i
managed
it
he
given
you
leave
she
asked
full
leave
we
shall
be
delightfully
comfortable
when
we
have
got
rid
of
the
old
man
olympe
was
still
in
bed
she
dived
under
the
and
wriggled
about
and
laughed
gleefully
shall
have
everything
to
do
as
we
like
with
then
we
i
shall
take
another
bedroom
and
go
out
into
the
garden
whenever
i
like
and
do
all
my
cooking
in
the
kitchen
my
brother
will
have
to
let
us
do
all
that
you
must
have
managed
to
frighten
him
very
much
it
was
not
till
about
ten
that
evening
that
trouche
made
his
appearance
at
the
low
café
where
he
was
accustomed
to
meet
guillaume
porquier
and
other
wild
young
fellows
they
joked
him
about
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
playfully
accused
him
of
having
been
out
on
the
ramparts
courting
one
of
the
girls
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
jests
of
this
kind
generally
pleased
him
but
that
night
he
remained
very
grave
he
declared
that
he
had
been
engaged
with
business
very
serious
business
it
was
only
about
midnight
when
he
had
emptied
the
decanters
on
the
counter
that
he
became
more
expansive
then
he
began
to
talk
familiarly
to
guillaume
leaning
the
while
against
the
wall
stammering
and
lighting
his
pipe
afresh
between
every
two
sentences
saw
your
father
this
evening
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
i
wanted
a
paper
from
him
he
was
very
kind
very
kind
indeed
he
gave
it
to
me
i
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
he
did
want
to
give
it
me
at
first
though
he
said
it
was
only
the
family
business
but
i
told
him
i
am
the
family
i
have
got
the
wife
orders
you
know
her
do
you
a
dear
little
woman
she
seemed
quite
pleased
when
i
went
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
her
beforehand
then
he
gave
me
the
paper
you
can
feel
it
here
in
my
pocket
guillaume
looked
at
him
concealing
his
extreme
curiosity
with
an
incredulous
laugh
telling
you
the
truth
continued
the
drunkard
paper
here
in
my
pocket
ca
you
feel
it
it
only
a
newspaper
said
guillaume
at
this
trouche
sniggered
and
drew
a
large
envelope
from
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
amidst
the
cups
and
glasses
for
a
moment
though
guillaume
had
reached
out
his
hand
he
prevented
him
from
taking
it
but
then
he
allowed
him
to
have
it
laughing
loudly
the
while
the
paper
proved
to
be
a
most
detailed
statement
by
doctor
porquier
with
respect
to
the
mental
condition
of
françois
mouret
householder
of
plassans
they
going
to
shut
him
up
then
asked
guillaume
handing
back
the
paper
no
business
of
yours
my
boy
replied
trouche
who
had
now
become
distrustful
again
paper
here
is
for
his
wife
i
am
merely
a
friend
who
is
glad
to
do
a
service
she
will
act
as
she
pleases
however
she
ca
go
on
letting
herself
be
half
murdered
poor
lady
by
the
time
they
were
turned
out
of
the
café
he
was
so
drunk
that
guillaume
had
to
accompany
him
to
the
rue
balande
he
wanted
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
on
every
seat
on
the
cours
sauvaire
when
they
reached
the
place
of
the
he
began
to
shed
tears
and
stutter
no
friends
now
everyone
despises
me
just
because
i
poor
but
you
are
a
young
fellow
and
you
shall
come
and
have
coffee
with
us
when
we
get
into
possession
if
the
abbé
interferes
with
us
we
send
him
to
keep
the
other
one
company
he
is
very
sharp
the
abbé
in
spite
of
all
his
grand
airs
i
can
persuade
him
into
believing
anything
but
you
are
a
real
friend
are
you
mouret
is
done
for
old
chap
we
drink
his
wine
together
when
guillaume
had
seen
trouche
to
his
door
he
walked
back
through
the
sleeping
town
and
went
and
whistled
softly
before
monsieur
house
it
was
a
signal
he
was
making
the
young
maffres
whom
their
father
locked
up
in
their
bedroom
opened
a
window
on
the
first
floor
and
descended
to
the
ground
by
the
help
of
the
bars
with
which
the
windows
were
protected
every
night
they
thus
went
off
to
the
haunts
of
vice
in
the
company
of
guillaume
porquier
he
said
to
them
when
they
had
reached
the
dark
paths
near
the
ramparts
need
trouble
ourselves
now
if
my
father
talks
any
more
about
sending
me
off
anywhere
i
shall
have
something
serious
to
say
to
him
i
bet
you
that
i
can
get
elected
into
the
young
club
whenever
i
like
now
the
following
night
marthe
had
a
dreadful
attack
she
had
been
present
in
the
morning
at
a
long
religious
ceremony
the
whole
of
which
olympe
had
insisted
upon
seeing
when
rose
and
the
lodgers
ran
into
the
room
upon
hearing
her
piercing
screams
they
found
her
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
her
forehead
gashed
open
mouret
was
kneeling
in
the
midst
of
the
trembling
all
over
has
killed
her
this
time
cried
the
cook
she
seized
mouret
in
her
arms
although
he
was
in
his
pushed
him
out
of
the
room
and
into
his
office
the
door
of
which
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
then
she
went
back
to
get
a
mattress
and
some
blankets
which
she
threw
to
him
trouche
had
set
off
at
a
run
for
doctor
porquier
when
the
doctor
arrived
he
dressed
wound
if
the
cut
had
been
a
trifle
lower
down
he
said
it
would
have
been
fatal
downstairs
in
the
hall
he
declared
in
the
presence
of
them
all
that
it
was
necessary
to
take
some
active
steps
and
that
madame
mouret
life
could
no
longer
be
left
at
the
mercy
of
a
violent
madman
the
next
morning
marthe
was
obliged
to
keep
her
bed
she
was
still
slightly
delirious
and
fancied
that
she
saw
an
iron
hand
driving
a
flaming
sword
into
her
skull
rose
absolutely
declined
to
allow
mouret
to
enter
the
room
she
served
him
his
lunch
on
a
dusty
table
in
his
own
office
he
was
still
gazing
at
his
plate
with
a
look
of
stupefaction
when
rose
ushered
into
the
room
three
men
dressed
in
black
you
the
doctors
he
asked
is
she
getting
on
is
better
than
she
was
replied
one
of
the
men
mouret
began
to
cut
his
bread
mechanically
as
though
he
were
going
to
eat
it
wish
the
children
were
here
he
said
would
look
after
her
and
we
should
be
more
lively
it
is
since
the
children
went
away
that
she
has
been
ill
i
am
no
longer
good
for
anything
he
raised
a
piece
of
bread
to
his
mouth
and
heavy
tears
trickled
down
his
face
the
man
who
had
already
spoken
to
him
now
said
casting
at
the
same
time
a
glance
at
his
companions
we
go
and
fetch
your
children
should
like
it
very
much
replied
mouret
rising
from
his
seat
us
start
at
once
as
he
went
downstairs
he
saw
no
one
except
trouche
and
his
wife
who
were
leaning
over
the
balustrade
on
the
second
floor
following
each
step
he
took
with
gleaming
eyes
olympe
hurried
down
behind
him
and
rushed
into
the
kitchen
where
rose
in
a
state
of
great
emotion
was
watching
out
of
the
window
when
a
carriage
which
was
waiting
at
the
door
had
driven
off
with
mouret
she
sprang
up
the
staircase
again
four
steps
at
a
time
and
seizing
trouche
by
his
shoulders
made
him
dance
round
the
landing
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
packed
off

cried
marthe
kept
her
bed
for
a
week
her
mother
came
to
see
her
every
afternoon
and
manifested
the
greatest
affection
the
faujases
and
the
trouches
succeeded
each
other
in
attendance
at
her
bedside
and
even
madame
de
condamin
called
to
see
her
several
times
nothing
was
said
about
mouret
and
rose
told
her
mistress
that
she
thought
he
had
gone
to
marseilles
when
marthe
however
was
able
to
come
downstairs
again
and
took
her
place
at
table
in
the
she
began
to
manifest
some
astonishment
and
inquired
uneasily
where
her
husband
was
my
dear
lady
do
distress
yourself
said
madame
faujas
you
will
make
yourself
ill
again
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
and
your
friends
felt
bound
to
consult
together
and
take
steps
for
your
protection
no
reason
to
regret
him
i
sure
cried
rose
harshly
whole
neighbourhood
breathes
more
freely
now
that
he
no
longer
here
one
was
always
afraid
of
him
setting
the
place
on
fire
or
rushing
out
into
the
street
with
a
knife
i
used
to
hide
all
the
knives
in
my
kitchen
and
monsieur
rastoil
cook
did
the
same
and
your
poor
mother
nearly
died
of
fright
everybody
who
has
been
here
while
you
have
been
ill
those
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
all
said
to
me
as
i
let
them
out
it
is
a
good
riddance
for
plassans
a
place
is
always
on
the
alert
when
a
man
like
that
is
free
to
go
about
as
he
likes
marthe
listened
to
this
stream
of
words
with
dilated
eyes
and
pale
face
she
had
let
her
spoon
fall
from
her
hand
and
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
in
front
of
her
as
though
some
dreadful
vision
rising
from
behind
the
in
the
garden
was
filling
her
with
terror

she
gasped
as
she
buried
her
face
in
her
trembling
hands
she
fell
backwards
and
was
fainting
away
when
abbé
faujas
who
had
finished
his
soup
grasped
her
hands
pressing
them
tightly
and
saying
in
his
softest
tone
yourself
strong
before
this
trial
which
god
is
sending
you
he
will
afford
you
consolation
if
you
do
not
prove
rebellious
he
will
grant
you
the
happiness
you
deserve
at
the
pressure
of
the
priest
hands
and
the
tender
tone
of
his
voice
marthe
revived
and
sat
up
again
with
flushing
cheeks
yes
she
cried
as
she
burst
into
sobs
have
great
need
of
happiness

me
great
happiness

xix
the
general
elections
were
to
take
place
in
october
about
the
middle
of
september
monseigneur
rousselot
suddenly
set
off
to
paris
after
having
a
long
interview
with
abbé
faujas
it
was
said
that
one
of
his
sisters
who
lived
at
versailles
was
seriously
five
days
later
he
was
back
in
plassans
again
and
he
called
abbé
surin
into
his
study
to
read
to
him
lying
back
in
his
easy
chair
closely
enveloped
in
a
padded
robe
of
violet
silk
although
the
weather
was
still
quite
warm
he
smilingly
listened
to
the
young
abbé
womanish
voice
as
he
softly
lisped
the
strophes
of
anacreon
very
good
he
said
express
the
music
of
that
beautiful
tongue
excellently
then
glancing
at
the
timepiece
with
an
expression
of
uneasiness
he
added
abbé
faujas
been
here
yet
this
morning
ah
my
child
what
a
dreadful
time
i
had
my
ears
are
still
buzzing
with
the
abominable
uproar
of
the
railway
it
was
raining
the
whole
time
i
was
in
paris
i
had
to
rush
all
over
the
place
and
saw
nothing
but
mud
everywhere
abbé
surin
laid
his
book
on
the
corner
of
a
small
table
your
lordship
satisfied
with
the
results
of
your
journey
he
asked
with
the
familiarity
of
a
petted
favourite
have
learnt
what
i
wanted
to
know
the
bishop
replied
with
his
subtle
smile
ought
to
have
taken
you
with
me
you
would
have
learnt
a
good
many
things
that
it
would
be
useful
for
you
to
know
at
your
age
destined
as
you
are
by
your
birth
and
connections
for
the
episcopate
am
listening
my
lord
said
the
young
priest
with
a
beseeching
expression
but
the
prelate
shook
his
head
no
these
matters
are
not
to
be
spoken
of
make
a
friend
of
abbé
faujas
he
maybe
able
to
do
much
for
you
some
day
i
have
received
full
information
about
him
abbé
surin
however
clasped
his
hands
with
such
a
wheedling
look
of
curiosity
that
monseigneur
rousselot
went
on
to
say
had
some
bother
or
other
at
besançon
afterwards
he
was
living
in
great
poverty
in
furnished
apartments
in
paris
he
went
and
offered
himself
just
at
that
time
the
minister
was
on
the
for
some
priests
devoted
to
the
government
i
was
told
that
faujas
at
first
quite
frightened
him
with
his
fierce
looks
and
his
old
cassock
it
was
quite
by
chance
that
he
was
sent
here
the
minister
was
most
pleasant
and
courteous
to
me
the
bishop
finished
his
sentences
with
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
as
he
sought
for
fitting
words
fearing
as
it
were
to
say
too
much
but
at
last
the
affection
which
he
felt
for
his
secretary
got
the
better
of
his
caution
and
he
continued
with
more
animation
my
advice
and
try
to
be
useful
to
the
vicar
of
he
will
want
all
the
assistance
he
can
get
and
he
seems
to
me
to
be
a
man
who
never
forgets
either
an
injury
or
a
kindness
but
do
ally
yourself
with
him
he
will
end
badly
that
is
my
impression
badly
exclaimed
the
young
priest
in
surprise
just
now
he
is
in
the
full
swing
of
triumph
but
his
face
disquiets
me
my
child
he
has
a
terrible
face
that
man
will
never
die
in
his
bed
do
you
do
anything
to
compromise
me
all
i
ask
is
to
be
allowed
to
live
tranquilly
quietness
is
all
i
want
abbé
surin
was
just
taking
up
his
book
again
when
abbé
faujas
was
announced
monseigneur
rousselot
advanced
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hands
and
a
smiling
face
addressing
him
as
his
curé
us
my
child
he
said
to
his
secretary
who
thereupon
retired
he
spoke
of
his
journey
his
sister
was
better
than
she
had
been
he
said
and
he
had
been
able
to
shake
hands
with
some
old
friends
did
you
see
the
minister
asked
abbé
faujas
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
call
upon
him
replied
the
bishop
who
felt
that
he
was
blushing
spoke
to
me
very
favourably
indeed
of
you
you
no
longer
have
any
doubts
you
trust
me
absolutely
my
dear
curé
besides
i
know
nothing
about
politics
myself
and
i
leave
everything
in
your
hands
they
remained
talking
together
the
whole
morning
abbé
faujas
persuaded
the
bishop
to
undertake
a
visitation
of
his
diocese
and
said
he
would
go
with
him
and
prompt
him
as
to
what
he
should
say
it
would
be
necessary
to
summon
all
the
rural
deans
so
that
the
priests
of
the
smallest
villages
might
receive
their
instructions
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
all
this
for
the
clergy
would
act
as
they
were
told
the
most
delicate
task
would
be
in
plassans
itself
in
the
district
of
the
aristocrats
there
shutting
themselves
up
in
the
privacy
of
their
houses
were
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
abbé
faujas
influence
and
he
had
so
far
only
been
able
to
work
upon
certain
ambitious
royalists
such
men
as
rastoil
and
maffre
and
bourdeu
the
bishop
however
undertook
to
sound
the
feelings
of
various
in
the
district
of
where
he
visited
but
even
allowing
that
the
aristocracy
should
vote
adversely
they
would
be
in
a
ridiculous
minority
if
they
were
deserted
by
those
electors
of
the
middle
classes
who
were
amenable
to
clerical
influence
said
monseigneur
rousselot
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
would
perhaps
be
as
well
if
you
told
me
the
name
of
your
candidate
so
that
i
may
recommend
him
in
my
letters
abbé
faujas
smiled
is
dangerous
to
mention
names
he
said
would
be
a
scrap
of
our
candidate
left
in
a
week
time
if
we
made
his
name
known
now
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
has
become
quite
out
of
the
question
monsieur
de
bourdeu
who
reckons
upon
being
a
candidate
is
still
more
so
we
shall
leave
them
to
destroy
each
other
and
then
at
the
last
moment
we
shall
come
forward
just
say
that
an
election
on
purely
political
grounds
would
be
very
regrettable
and
that
what
is
needed
for
the
interests
of
plassans
is
somebody
who
is
not
a
party
man
but
has
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
the
town
and
the
department
and
you
may
let
it
be
understood
that
such
a
man
has
been
found
but
do
go
any
further
the
bishop
now
in
his
turn
smiled
he
detained
the
priest
for
a
moment
as
he
was
about
to
take
leave
abbé
fenil
he
said
lowering
his
voice
you
not
afraid
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
thwart
your
plans
abbé
faujas
shrugged
his
shoulders
has
made
no
sign
at
all
he
said
is
precisely
that
quietness
of
his
that
makes
me
uneasy
rejoined
the
prelate
know
fenil
well
he
is
the
most
vindictive
priest
in
my
diocese
he
may
possibly
have
abandoned
the
ambition
of
beating
you
in
the
political
arena
but
you
may
be
sure
he
will
wreak
personal
vengeance
upon
you
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
keeping
a
watch
on
you
in
his
retirement
said
abbé
faujas
showing
his
white
teeth
take
care
that
he
does
eat
me
up
abbé
surin
had
just
returned
into
the
room
and
when
the
vicar
of
had
gone
he
made
the
bishop
laugh
by
exclaiming
if
they
could
only
devour
each
other
like
a
couple
of
foxes
and
leave
nothing
but
their
tails
the
electoral
campaign
was
on
the
point
of
commencing
plassans
which
generally
remained
quite
calm
unexcited
by
political
questions
was
growing
a
little
feverish
and
perturbed
from
some
invisible
mouth
a
breath
of
war
seemed
to
sweep
through
its
quiet
streets
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
who
lived
at
la
palud
a
large
straggling
village
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
plassans
for
the
last
fortnight
staying
at
the
house
of
a
relative
of
his
the
count
de
valqueyras
whose
mansion
was
one
of
the
largest
in
the
district
the
marquis
showed
himself
about
the
town
promenaded
on
the
cours
sauvaire
attended
and
bowed
to
sundry
influential
townspeople
but
without
succeeding
in
throwing
aside
his
haughty
ways
his
attempts
to
acquire
popularity
seemed
to
fail
fresh
charges
against
him
originating
from
some
unknown
source
were
bandied
about
every
day
it
was
asserted
that
he
was
a
miserably
incompetent
man
with
any
other
representative
plassans
would
long
ago
have
had
a
branch
line
of
railway
connecting
it
with
nice
it
was
said
too
that
if
anyone
from
the
district
went
to
see
him
in
paris
he
had
to
call
three
or
four
times
before
he
could
obtain
the
slightest
service
however
although
the
candidature
of
the
marquis
was
much
damaged
by
gossip
of
this
kind
no
other
candidate
had
openly
entered
the
lists
there
was
some
talk
of
monsieur
de
bourdeu
coming
forward
though
it
was
considered
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
a
majority
for
an
of
who
had
no
strong
connection
with
the
place
there
seemed
also
to
be
some
unknown
influence
at
work
in
plassans
upsetting
all
the
previous
prospects
of
the
election
by
breaking
the
alliance
between
the
legitimists
and
the
republicans
the
prevailing
feeling
was
one
of
general
perplexity
and
confusion
mingled
with
weariness
and
a
desire
to
get
the
affair
over
as
quickly
as
possible
majority
is
shifting
said
the
politicians
of
the
cours
sauvaire
question
is
which
way
will
it
finally
incline
amid
the
excitement
and
restlessness
which
this
doubtful
state
of
things
was
causing
in
the
town
the
republicans
became
anxious
to
run
a
candidate
of
their
own
their
choice
fell
upon
a
one
maurin
a
plain
simple
man
who
was
very
much
liked
by
the
in
the
cafés
in
the
evenings
trouche
expressed
an
opinion
that
maurin
was
by
no
means
sufficiently
advanced
in
his
views
and
proposed
in
his
stead
a
wheelwright
of
les
tulettes
whose
name
had
appeared
in
the
list
of
the
december
proscripts
this
man
however
had
the
good
sense
to
decline
the
nomination
it
should
be
said
that
trouche
now
gave
himself
out
as
an
extreme
republican
he
would
have
come
forward
himself
he
said
if
his
wife
brother
had
not
been
a
parson
but
as
he
was
to
his
great
regret
he
declared
forced
to
eat
the
bread
of
the
hypocrites
he
felt
bound
to
remain
in
the
background
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
circulate
reports
to
the
detriment
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
and
he
also
favoured
the
rupture
of
the
republicans
and
the
legitimists
trouche
greatest
success
was
obtained
by
accusing
the
party
and
the
adherents
of
monsieur
rastoil
of
having
brought
about
the
confinement
of
poor
mouret
with
the
view
of
depriving
the
democratic
party
of
one
of
its
worthiest
chiefs
on
the
evening
when
he
first
launched
this
accusation
at
a
in
the
rue
canquoin
the
company
assembled
there
looked
at
one
other
with
a
peculiar
expression
the
gossips
of
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
spoke
quite
feelingly
about
madman
who
beat
his
wife
now
that
he
was
shut
up
at
les
tulettes
and
told
one
another
that
abbé
faujas
had
simply
wanted
to
get
an
inconvenient
husband
out
of
his
way
trouche
repeated
his
charge
every
evening
banging
his
fists
upon
the
tables
of
the
cafés
with
such
an
air
of
conviction
that
he
succeeded
in
persuading
his
listeners
of
the
truth
of
his
story
in
which
by
the
way
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
was
made
to
play
the
most
extraordinary
part
imaginable
there
was
a
complete
reaction
in
mouret
favour
he
was
considered
to
be
a
political
victim
a
man
whose
influence
had
been
feared
so
much
that
he
had
been
put
out
of
the
way
in
a
cell
at
a
leave
it
all
to
me
trouche
said
with
a
confidential
air
expose
all
these
precious
pious
folks
and
i
tell
some
fine
stories
about
their
home
of
the
virgin
it
a
nice
place
is
that
home
a
place
where
the
ladies
make
assignations
meanwhile
abbé
faujas
almost
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
multiplying
himself
for
some
time
past
he
was
to
be
seen
everywhere
he
bestowed
much
attention
upon
his
appearance
and
was
careful
always
to
have
a
pleasant
smile
upon
his
face
though
now
and
then
his
eyelids
dropped
for
an
instant
to
hide
the
stern
fire
kindling
in
his
glance
often
with
his
patience
quite
worn
out
weary
of
his
wretched
struggles
he
returned
to
his
bare
room
with
clenched
fists
old
madame
rougon
whom
he
continued
to
see
in
secret
proved
his
good
genius
she
lectured
him
soundly
whenever
he
felt
despondent
and
kept
him
bent
before
her
while
she
told
him
that
he
must
strive
to
please
and
that
he
would
ruin
everything
if
he
let
the
iron
hand
appear
from
under
the
velvet
glove
afterwards
when
he
had
made
himself
master
he
might
seize
plassans
by
the
throat
and
strangle
it
if
he
liked
she
herself
certainly
had
no
great
affection
for
plassans
against
which
she
owed
a
grudge
for
forty
years
wretchedness
and
which
had
been
bursting
with
jealousy
of
her
ever
since
the
coup
is
i
who
wear
the
cassock
she
said
sometimes
with
a
smile
carry
yourself
like
a
gendarme
my
dear
curé
the
priest
showed
himself
particularly
assiduous
in
his
attendance
at
the
young
men
club
he
listened
with
an
indulgent
air
to
the
young
men
talking
politics
and
told
them
with
a
shake
of
his
head
that
honesty
was
all
that
was
necessary
his
popularity
at
the
club
was
still
increasing
one
evening
he
consented
to
play
at
billiards
and
showed
himself
extremely
skilful
at
the
game
and
sometimes
when
they
formed
a
quiet
little
party
he
would
even
accept
a
cigarette
the
club
took
his
advice
on
every
question
that
arose
his
reputation
for
tolerance
was
completely
established
by
the
kind
way
in
which
he
advocated
the
admission
of
guillaume
porquier
who
had
now
renewed
his
application
have
seen
the
young
man
he
said
came
to
me
to
make
a
general
confession
and
i
ended
by
giving
him
absolution
there
is
forgiveness
for
every
sin
we
must
not
treat
him
as
a
leper
just
because
he
pulled
down
a
few
signboards
in
plassans
and
ran
into
debt
at
paris
when
guillaume
was
elected
he
said
to
the
young
maffres
with
a
grin
you
owe
me
a
couple
of
bottles
of
champagne
now
you
see
that
the
curé
does
all
that
i
want
i
have
a
little
machine
to
tickle
him
with
in
a
sensitive
place
and
then
he
begins
to
laugh
my
boys
and
he
ca
refuse
me
anything
it
does
seem
as
though
he
were
very
fond
of
you
anyhow
said
alphonse
looks
very
sourly
at
you
that
because
i
tickled
him
too
hard
you
will
see
that
we
shall
soon
be
the
best
friends
in
the
world
abbé
faujas
did
indeed
seem
to
have
an
affection
for
the
son
he
declared
that
this
young
man
wanted
guiding
with
a
very
gentle
hand
in
a
short
time
guillaume
became
the
moving
spirit
of
the
club
he
invented
amusements
showed
them
how
to
make
punch
and
led
young
fellows
fresh
from
college
into
all
sorts
of
dissipation
his
pleasant
vices
gave
him
enormous
influence
while
the
organ
was
pealing
above
the
he
drank
away
and
gathered
round
him
the
sons
of
the
most
respectable
people
in
plassans
making
them
almost
choke
with
laughter
at
his
broad
stories
the
club
now
got
into
a
very
fast
way
indulging
in
doubtful
topics
of
conversation
in
all
the
corners
abbé
faujas
however
appeared
quite
unconscious
of
it
guillaume
said
that
he
had
a
splendid
noddle
teeming
with
the
greatest
thoughts
abbé
may
be
a
bishop
whenever
he
likes
he
remarked
has
already
refused
a
living
in
paris
he
wants
to
stay
at
plassans
he
has
taken
a
liking
to
the
place
i
should
like
to
nominate
him
as
deputy
he
the
sort
of
man
we
want
in
the
chamber
but
he
would
never
consent
he
is
too
modest
still
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
take
his
advice
when
the
elections
are
at
hand
we
may
trust
anything
that
he
tells
us
he
would
deceive
anybody
meantime
lucien
delangre
remained
the
serious
man
of
the
club
he
showed
great
deference
to
abbé
faujas
and
won
the
group
of
studious
young
men
over
to
the
priest
side
he
frequently
walked
with
him
to
the
club
talking
to
him
with
much
animation
but
subsiding
into
silence
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
general
room
on
leaving
the
café
established
beneath
the
church
of
the
minimes
the
abbé
regularly
went
to
the
home
of
the
virgin
he
arrived
there
during
and
made
his
appearance
with
a
smiling
face
upon
the
steps
of
the
playground
thereupon
the
girls
surrounded
him
and
disputed
with
each
other
for
the
possession
of
his
pockets
in
which
some
sacred
pictures
or
chaplets
or
medals
that
had
been
blessed
were
always
to
be
found
those
big
girls
quite
worshipped
him
as
he
tapped
them
gently
on
their
cheeks
and
told
them
to
be
good
at
which
they
broke
into
sly
smiles
the
sisters
often
complained
to
him
that
the
children
confided
to
their
care
were
utterly
unmanageable
that
they
fought
tore
each
other
hair
and
did
even
worse
things
the
abbé
however
regarded
their
offences
as
mere
peccadilloes
and
as
a
rule
simply
reproved
the
more
turbulent
girls
in
the
chapel
whence
they
emerged
in
a
more
submissive
frame
of
mind
occasionally
he
made
some
rather
graver
piece
of
misconduct
a
pretext
for
sending
for
the
parents
whom
he
sent
away
again
quite
touched
by
his
kindness
and
in
this
wise
the
young
scapegraces
of
the
home
of
the
virgin
gained
him
the
hearts
of
the
poor
families
of
plassans
when
they
went
home
in
the
evening
they
told
the
most
wonderful
things
about
his
reverence
the
curé
it
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
to
find
a
couple
of
them
in
some
secluded
corner
of
the
ramparts
on
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
to
decide
which
of
them
his
reverence
liked
the
better
young
hussies
represent
from
two
to
three
thousand
votes
trouche
thought
to
himself
as
from
the
window
he
watched
abbé
faujas
showing
himself
so
amiable
trouche
himself
had
tried
to
win
over
little
dears
as
he
called
the
girls
but
the
priest
distrusting
him
had
forbidden
him
to
set
foot
in
the
playground
and
so
he
now
confined
himself
to
throwing
there
when
the
sisters
backs
were
turned
the
abbé
day
work
did
not
end
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
from
there
he
started
on
a
series
of
short
visits
to
the
fashionable
ladies
of
plassans
madame
rastoil
and
madame
delangre
welcomed
him
with
delight
and
repeated
his
slightest
words
everywhere
but
his
great
friend
was
madame
de
condamin
she
maintained
an
air
of
easy
familiarity
towards
him
betokening
the
superiority
of
a
beautiful
woman
who
is
conscious
that
she
is
she
spoke
now
and
again
in
low
tones
and
with
meaning
smiles
and
glances
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
was
some
secret
understanding
between
them
when
the
priest
came
to
see
her
she
dismissed
her
husband
government
was
going
to
hold
a
so
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
playfully
said
as
he
philosophically
went
off
to
mount
his
horse
it
was
madame
rougon
who
had
brought
madame
de
condamin
to
the
notice
has
not
yet
absolutely
established
her
position
here
the
old
lady
explained
to
abbé
faujas
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cleverness
under
those
pretty
coquettish
airs
of
hers
you
can
take
her
into
your
confidence
and
she
will
see
in
your
triumph
a
means
of
making
her
own
success
and
power
more
complete
she
will
be
of
great
use
to
you
if
you
should
find
it
necessary
to
give
away
places
or
crosses
she
has
retained
an
influential
friend
in
paris
who
sends
her
as
many
red
ribbons
as
she
asks
for
as
madame
rougon
kept
herself
aloof
from
reasons
of
diplomacy
the
fair
octavie
thus
became
abbé
faujas
most
active
ally
she
won
over
to
his
side
both
her
friends
and
her
friends
friends
she
resumed
her
campaign
afresh
every
morning
and
exerted
an
astonishing
amount
of
influence
merely
by
the
pleasant
little
waves
of
her
delicately
gloved
fingers
she
had
particular
success
with
the
and
increased
tenfold
that
feminine
influence
of
which
the
priest
had
felt
the
absolute
necessity
as
soon
as
he
began
to
thread
the
narrow
world
of
plassans
she
succeeded
too
in
closing
the
mouths
of
the
paloques
who
were
growing
very
rabid
about
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
mourets
house
by
throwing
a
honied
cake
to
the
two
monsters
do
you
still
bear
us
a
grudge
my
dear
lady
she
said
one
day
as
she
met
the
judge
wife
is
very
wrong
of
you
your
friends
have
not
forgotten
you
they
are
thinking
about
you
and
are
preparing
a
surprise
for
you
fine
surprise
i
be
bound
cried
madame
paloque
bitterly
we
are
not
going
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
laughed
at
again
i
have
firmly
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
to
my
own
affairs
madame
de
condamin
smiled
would
you
say
she
asked
monsieur
paloque
were
to
be
decorated
the
judge
wife
stared
in
silence
a
rush
of
blood
to
her
face
turned
it
quite
blue
and
made
her
terrible
to
behold
are
joking
she
stammered
is
only
another
plot
against
us
if
it
is
true
i
never
forgive
you
the
fair
octavie
swore
that
she
had
spoken
nothing
but
the
truth
the
distinction
would
certainly
be
conferred
upon
monsieur
paloque
but
it
would
not
be
officially
notified
in
the
until
after
the
elections
as
the
government
did
not
wish
it
to
appear
as
if
it
were
buying
the
support
of
the
magistracy
she
also
hinted
that
abbé
faujas
was
not
unconcerned
in
the
bestowal
of
this
reward
and
said
that
he
had
talked
about
it
to
the
husband
was
right
then
exclaimed
madame
paloque
in
great
surprise
a
long
time
past
he
has
been
worrying
me
dreadfully
to
go
and
apologise
to
the
abbé
but
i
am
very
obstinate
and
i
would
have
let
myself
be
killed
sooner
but
since
the
abbé
makes
the
first
move
well
we
ask
nothing
more
than
to
live
at
peace
with
everyone
we
will
go
to
the
the
next
day
the
paloques
were
very
humble
madame
paloque
accused
abbé
fenil
of
the
blackest
conduct
and
related
with
consummate
impudence
how
she
had
gone
to
see
him
one
day
and
how
he
had
spoken
in
her
presence
of
turning
whole
of
abbé
faujas
clique
out
of
plassans
you
like
she
said
to
the
priest
taking
him
aside
will
give
you
a
note
written
at
the
dictation
it
concerns
you
he
tried
i
believe
to
get
several
discreditable
stories
inserted
in
the
plassans
gazette
did
this
note
come
into
your
hands
asked
faujas
it
sufficient
that
it
is
there
she
replied
without
any
sign
of
embarrassment
and
with
a
smile
she
continued
found
it
i
recollect
by
the
way
that
there
are
two
or
three
words
written
in
the
own
hand
i
may
trust
to
your
honour
in
all
this
may
i
not
we
are
upright
honest
people
and
we
do
want
to
compromise
ourselves
she
pretended
to
be
affected
by
scruples
for
three
days
before
bringing
him
the
note
and
madame
de
condamin
was
obliged
to
assure
her
privately
that
an
application
to
have
monsieur
rastoil
pensioned
off
would
shortly
be
made
so
that
her
husband
could
succeed
to
his
post
then
she
gave
up
the
paper
abbé
faujas
did
not
wish
to
keep
it
himself
but
took
it
to
madame
rougon
and
charged
her
to
make
use
of
it
keeping
herself
however
strictly
in
the
background
if
the
showed
the
slightest
sign
of
interfering
in
the
elections
madame
de
condamin
also
dropped
a
hint
to
monsieur
maffre
that
the
emperor
was
thinking
about
decorating
him
and
she
made
a
formal
promise
to
doctor
porquier
to
find
a
suitable
post
for
his
son
she
showed
the
most
obliging
kindliness
at
the
friendly
afternoon
meetings
in
the
gardens
the
summer
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
but
she
still
arrived
in
light
toilettes
shivering
slightly
and
risking
a
cold
in
order
to
show
her
arms
and
overcome
the
last
scruples
of
the
rastoil
party
it
was
really
under
the
arbour
that
the
election
was
decided
my
dear
said
abbé
faujas
one
day
with
a
smile
when
the
two
sets
of
guests
were
mingling
together
great
battle
is
drawing
near
they
had
now
arrived
at
discussing
the
political
struggle
in
a
quiet
friendly
way
in
the
gardens
at
the
back
of
the
houses
they
cordially
grasped
each
other
hands
while
in
front
of
them
they
still
feigned
an
appearance
of
hostility
on
hearing
abbé
faujas
madame
de
condamin
cast
a
quick
glance
at
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
who
bent
forward
with
his
habitual
elegance
and
said
all
in
a
breath
shall
remain
in
my
tent
monsieur
le
curé
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
make
his
excellency
understand
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
in
the
immediate
interests
of
plassans
to
hold
itself
aloof
there
will
be
no
official
candidate
monsieur
de
bourdeu
turned
pale
his
eyelids
quivered
and
his
hands
trembled
with
delight
will
be
no
official
candidate
cried
monsieur
rastoil
greatly
moved
by
this
unexpected
news
and
departing
from
the
reserve
which
he
generally
maintained
replied
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
town
contains
a
sufficient
number
of
honourable
men
to
make
its
own
choice
of
a
representative
he
bowed
slightly
towards
monsieur
de
bourdeu
who
rose
from
his
seat
and
stammered
undoubtedly
while
these
remarks
were
being
exchanged
abbé
surin
had
got
up
a
game
of
and
cold
and
monsieur
rastoil
daughters
and
monsieur
maffre
sons
and
séverin
were
busy
hunting
for
the
handkerchief
which
he
had
rolled
into
a
ball
and
hidden
all
the
young
people
were
flitting
about
their
elders
while
the
priest
called
in
his
falsetto
voice
hot
angéline
at
length
found
the
handkerchief
in
doctor
porquier
gaping
pocket
where
abbé
surin
had
adroitly
slipped
it
they
all
laughed
and
considered
the
selection
of
the
a
very
ingenious
joke
has
a
chance
now
said
monsieur
rastoil
taking
abbé
faujas
aside
is
very
annoying
i
ca
tell
him
so
but
we
vote
for
him
he
has
compromised
himself
too
much
as
an
orleanist
look
at
your
son
séverin
cried
madame
de
condamin
interrupting
the
conversation
a
big
baby
he
is
he
put
the
handkerchief
under
abbé
bourrette
hat
then
she
lowered
her
voice
as
she
continued
the
way
i
have
to
congratulate
you
monsieur
rastoil
i
have
received
a
letter
from
paris
from
a
correspondent
who
tells
me
that
he
has
seen
your
son
name
on
an
official
list
he
will
be
nominated
assessor
to
the
public
prosecutor
at
faverolles
i
believe
the
presiding
judge
bowed
with
a
flushed
face
the
minister
had
never
forgiven
the
election
of
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
since
then
a
kind
of
fatality
had
seemed
to
prevent
him
from
finding
either
a
place
for
his
son
or
husbands
for
his
daughters
he
had
never
uttered
any
complaints
but
his
compressed
lips
had
often
borne
witness
to
his
feelings
on
the
matter
was
remarking
to
you
he
resumed
to
conceal
his
emotion
bourdeu
is
dangerous
but
he
is
a
plassans
man
and
he
does
know
our
requirements
we
might
just
as
well
the
marquis
monsieur
de
bourdeu
persists
in
his
candidature
rejoined
abbé
faujas
republicans
will
poll
an
imposing
minority
which
will
have
a
very
bad
effect
madame
de
condamin
smiled
she
pretended
to
understand
nothing
about
politics
and
slipped
away
while
the
abbé
drew
the
presiding
judge
aside
to
the
end
of
the
arbour
where
they
continued
the
conversation
in
subdued
tones
as
they
slowly
strolled
back
again
monsieur
rastoil
remarked
are
quite
right
he
would
be
a
very
suitable
candidate
he
belongs
to
no
party
and
we
could
all
unite
in
supporting
him
i
am
no
fonder
of
the
empire
than
you
are
but
it
would
be
childish
to
go
on
sending
deputies
to
the
chamber
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
obstruct
and
rail
at
the
government
plassans
is
suffering
from
such
tactics
what
we
want
is
a
man
with
a
good
head
for
business
a
local
man
who
can
look
after
the
interests
of
the
place
hot
now
cried
aurélie
in
her
fluty
voice
abbé
surin
passed
through
the
arbour
at
the
head
of
the
searchers
hunting
for
the
handkerchief
cold
exclaimed
the
girl
laughing
at
their
lack
of
success
one
of
the
young
maffres
however
lifted
up
a
and
there
discovered
the
handkerchief
folded
in
four
big
stick
aurélie
might
have
very
well
crammed
it
into
her
mouth
said
madame
paloque
is
plenty
of
room
for
it
and
no
one
would
ever
have
thought
of
looking
for
it
there
her
husband
reduced
her
to
silence
with
an
angry
look
he
would
no
longer
allow
her
to
indulge
in
bitter
language
fearing
that
monsieur
de
condamin
might
have
overheard
her
he
exclaimed
a
handsome
lot
of
young
people
success
is
certain
my
dear
sir
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
was
saying
to
monsieur
de
bourdeu
be
careful
what
you
do
when
you
get
to
paris
i
hear
from
a
very
trustworthy
source
that
the
government
has
resolved
upon
taking
strong
measures
if
the
opposition
shows
itself
too
provoking
the
looked
at
monsieur
de
condamin
very
uneasily
wondering
if
he
was
making
fun
of
him
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
merely
smiled
and
stroked
his
moustaches
then
the
conversation
became
general
again
and
monsieur
de
bourdeu
thought
he
could
detect
that
everyone
was
congratulating
him
upon
his
approaching
triumph
with
a
discretion
that
was
full
of
tact
he
enjoyed
the
sweets
of
an
imaginary
popularity
is
surprising
how
much
more
quickly
the
grapes
ripen
in
the
sun
remarked
abbé
bourrette
who
had
never
moved
from
his
chair
but
now
raised
his
eyes
to
the
arbour
the
north
doctor
porquier
explained
can
often
only
be
got
to
ripen
by
freeing
them
from
the
surrounding
leaves
they
were
beginning
to
discuss
this
point
when
séverin
in
his
turn
cried
out
hot
but
he
had
hung
the
handkerchief
with
such
little
concealment
upon
the
garden
door
that
abbé
surin
found
it
at
once
when
the
abbé
hid
it
again
the
whole
troop
vainly
scoured
the
garden
for
nearly
half
an
hour
and
at
last
gave
it
up
then
the
abbé
showed
it
to
them
lying
in
the
centre
of
a
flowerbed
rolled
up
so
artistically
that
it
looked
like
a
white
stone
this
was
the
most
effective
stratagem
of
the
afternoon
the
news
that
the
government
had
determined
to
run
no
candidate
of
its
own
quickly
spread
through
the
town
where
it
gave
rise
to
great
excitement
this
abstention
had
the
natural
effect
of
disquieting
the
various
political
sections
who
had
each
counted
upon
the
diversion
of
a
certain
number
of
votes
in
favour
of
the
official
candidate
to
enable
their
own
man
to
win
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
monsieur
de
bourdeu
and
hatter
maurin
appeared
to
divide
the
support
of
the
voters
pretty
equally
amongst
them
there
would
certainly
be
a
second
ballot
and
heaven
only
could
tell
what
name
would
then
appear
at
the
top
of
the
list
however
there
was
certainly
some
talk
of
a
fourth
candidate
whose
name
nobody
quite
knew
some
moderate
equable
man
who
would
possibly
bring
the
different
parties
into
concord
and
harmony
the
plassans
electors
who
had
grown
a
little
alarmed
since
they
had
felt
the
imperial
bridle
about
their
necks
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
choose
one
of
their
who
would
be
acceptable
to
all
parties
government
is
wrong
to
treat
us
like
refractory
children
said
the
politicians
of
the
commercial
club
in
tones
of
annoyance
would
suppose
that
the
town
was
a
of
revolution
if
the
authorities
had
been
tactful
enough
to
bring
forward
the
right
sort
of
candidate
we
should
all
have
voted
for
him
the
has
talked
about
a
lesson
well
we
receive
the
lesson
we
shall
be
able
to
find
a
candidate
for
ourselves
and
we
will
show
that
plassans
is
a
town
of
sound
sense
and
true
liberty
they
then
began
to
look
about
for
a
candidate
but
the
names
which
were
proposed
by
friends
or
interested
parties
only
served
to
increase
the
confusion
in
a
week
time
there
were
twenty
candidates
before
plassans
madame
rougon
who
had
become
very
uneasy
and
quite
unable
to
understand
the
position
went
to
see
abbé
faujas
full
of
indignation
with
the
that
péqueur
was
an
ass
she
cried
a
fop
a
dummy
of
no
use
except
as
a
pretty
ornament
to
the
official
he
had
already
allowed
the
government
to
be
defeated
and
now
he
was
going
to
compromise
it
by
an
attitude
of
ridiculous
indifference
yourself
easy
said
the
priest
with
a
smile
time
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
is
confining
himself
to
obeying
orders
victory
is
certain
you
got
no
candidate
cried
madame
rougon
is
your
candidate
then
the
priest
unfolded
his
plans
to
her
she
expressed
her
approval
of
them
but
she
received
the
name
which
he
confided
to
her
with
the
greatest
surprise
she
exclaimed
have
chosen
him
no
one
has
ever
thought
of
him
i
assure
you
trust
that
they
have
replied
the
priest
again
smiling
want
a
candidate
of
whom
nobody
has
ever
thought
so
that
all
parties
may
accept
him
without
fancying
that
they
are
compromising
themselves
then
with
the
perfect
frankness
of
a
shrewd
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
explain
his
designs
he
continued
have
very
much
to
thank
you
for
you
have
prevented
me
from
making
many
mistakes
i
was
looking
straight
towards
the
goal
and
i
did
not
see
the
strings
that
were
stretched
across
the
path
and
which
might
perhaps
have
tripped
me
up
and
brought
me
to
grief
thank
heaven
all
this
petty
childish
struggle
is
over
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
move
at
my
ease
as
for
the
choice
i
have
made
it
is
a
good
one
you
may
feel
quite
assured
of
that
ever
since
my
arrival
at
plassans
i
have
been
looking
about
for
a
man
and
he
is
the
only
one
i
have
found
he
is
flexible
very
capable
and
very
energetic
he
has
been
clever
enough
not
to
embroil
himself
with
a
single
person
in
the
place
which
is
no
common
accomplishment
i
know
that
you
are
not
a
very
great
friend
of
his
and
that
is
the
reason
that
i
did
not
confide
my
plan
to
you
sooner
but
you
will
see
that
you
are
mistaken
and
that
he
will
make
his
way
rapidly
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
foot
into
the
stirrup
what
finally
determined
me
in
his
favour
is
what
i
heard
about
his
means
it
is
said
that
he
has
taken
his
wife
back
again
three
separate
times
after
she
had
been
detected
in
actual
unfaithfulness
and
after
he
had
made
his
pay
him
a
hundred
thousand
francs
on
each
occasion
if
he
has
really
coined
money
in
that
way
he
will
be
very
useful
in
paris
in
certain
matters
you
may
look
about
as
much
as
you
like
but
putting
him
aside
there
is
only
a
pack
of
imbeciles
in
plassans
it
is
a
present
you
are
making
to
the
government
said
félicité
with
a
laugh
she
allowed
herself
to
be
convinced
the
next
day
the
name
of
delangre
was
in
everybody
mouth
his
friends
declared
that
it
was
only
after
the
strongest
pressure
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
him
that
he
had
accepted
the
nomination
he
had
refused
it
for
a
long
time
considering
himself
unworthy
of
the
position
insisting
that
he
was
not
a
politician
and
that
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
and
monsieur
de
bourdeu
had
on
the
other
hand
had
long
experience
of
public
affairs
then
when
it
had
been
impressed
upon
him
that
what
plassans
urgently
needed
was
a
representative
who
was
unconnected
with
the
political
parties
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
prevailed
upon
he
explicitly
declared
the
principles
upon
which
he
should
act
if
he
were
returned
it
must
be
thoroughly
understood
he
said
that
he
would
not
go
to
the
chamber
either
to
oppose
or
support
the
government
under
all
circumstances
he
should
look
upon
himself
solely
as
the
representative
of
the
interests
of
the
town
he
would
always
vote
for
liberty
with
order
and
order
with
liberty
and
would
still
remain
mayor
of
plassans
so
that
he
might
show
what
a
conciliatory
and
purely
administrative
task
he
had
charged
himself
with
these
views
struck
people
as
being
singularly
sensible
the
knowing
politicians
of
the
commercial
club
vied
with
each
other
that
same
evening
in
lauding
delangre
told
you
so
he
is
the
very
man
we
want
i
shall
be
curious
to
see
what
the
will
say
when
the
mayor
name
heads
the
list
the
authorities
can
scarcely
accuse
us
of
having
voted
like
a
lot
of
sulking
any
more
than
they
can
reproach
us
with
having
gone
down
on
our
knees
before
the
government
if
the
empire
could
only
receive
a
few
lessons
like
this
things
would
go
much
better
the
whole
thing
was
like
a
train
of
gunpowder
the
mine
was
laid
and
a
spark
was
sufficient
to
set
it
off
in
every
part
of
plassans
simultaneously
in
all
the
three
quarters
of
the
town
in
every
house
and
in
every
family
monsieur
delangre
name
was
pronounced
amidst
unanimous
eulogies
he
had
become
the
expected
messiah
the
saviour
unknown
the
previous
day
revealed
in
the
morning
and
worshipped
ere
night
even
in
the
sacristies
and
confessionals
of
plassans
his
name
was
buzzed
about
it
mingled
with
the
echoes
in
the
naves
sounded
from
pulpits
in
the
suburbs
was
passed
on
from
ear
to
ear
like
a
sacrament
and
made
its
way
into
the
most
distant
homes
of
the
pious
the
priests
carried
it
about
with
them
in
the
folds
of
their
cassocks
abbé
bourrette
bestowed
on
it
the
respectable
cheeriness
of
his
corporation
abbé
surin
the
grace
of
his
smile
and
monseigneur
rousselot
the
charm
of
his
pastoral
blessing
the
fashionable
ladies
were
never
tired
of
talking
of
monsieur
delangre
he
had
such
a
kind
disposition
they
said
and
such
a
fine
sensible
face
madame
rastoil
learned
to
blush
again
at
mention
of
him
madame
paloque
grew
almost
pretty
in
her
enthusiasm
while
as
for
madame
de
condamin
she
was
ready
to
fight
for
him
and
won
all
hearts
to
his
side
by
the
tender
way
in
which
she
pressed
the
hands
of
the
electors
who
promised
to
vote
for
him
the
young
men
club
too
grew
passionately
enthusiastic
on
his
behalf
séverin
made
quite
a
hero
of
him
and
guillaume
and
the
young
maffres
went
canvassing
for
him
through
all
the
disreputable
parts
of
the
town
on
the
day
of
the
election
his
majority
was
overwhelming
the
whole
town
seemed
to
have
conspired
together
to
return
him
the
marquis
de
lagrifoul
and
monsieur
de
bourdeu
bursting
with
indignation
and
crying
that
they
had
been
betrayed
had
retired
from
the
contest
and
thus
monsieur
delangre
only
opponent
was
the
hatter
maurin
the
latter
received
the
votes
of
some
fifteen
hundred
intractable
republicans
of
the
outskirts
of
the
town
while
the
mayor
had
the
support
of
the
country
districts
the
fervent
bonapartists
the
townsmen
of
the
new
quarter
who
were
amenable
to
clerical
influence
the
timid
shopkeepers
of
the
old
town
and
even
certain
royalists
of
the
district
of
whose
aristocratic
denizens
chiefly
abstained
from
voting
monsieur
delangre
thus
obtained
thousand
votes
the
business
was
managed
so
promptly
the
victory
was
won
with
such
a
dash
that
plassans
felt
quite
amazed
on
the
evening
of
the
election
to
find
itself
so
unanimous
the
town
half
fancied
that
it
had
just
had
a
wonderful
dream
that
some
powerful
hand
must
have
struck
the
soil
and
drawn
from
it
those
thousand
electors
that
army
almost
alarming
in
its
numbers
whose
strength
no
one
had
ever
before
suspected
the
politicians
of
the
commercial
club
looked
at
one
another
in
perplexity
like
men
dazed
with
victory
in
the
evening
monsieur
rastoil
friends
joined
those
of
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
to
congratulate
each
other
in
a
little
at
the
overlooking
the
gardens
tea
was
served
to
them
the
great
victory
of
the
day
ended
by
a
coalition
of
the
two
parties
all
the
usual
guests
were
present
have
never
systematically
opposed
any
government
said
monsieur
rastoil
after
a
time
as
he
accepted
some
little
cakes
which
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
offered
him
judicial
bench
ought
to
take
no
part
in
political
struggles
i
willingly
admit
that
the
empire
has
already
accomplished
some
great
things
and
that
it
has
a
still
nobler
future
before
it
if
it
continues
to
advance
in
the
paths
of
justice
and
liberty
the
bowed
as
though
this
eulogy
was
addressed
to
himself
personally
the
previous
evening
monsieur
rastoil
had
read
in
the
a
decree
appointing
his
son
assistant
public
prosecutor
at
faverolles
there
was
also
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
a
marriage
between
his
eldest
daughter
and
lucien
delangre
yes
it
is
quite
settled
monsieur
de
condamin
said
in
low
tones
to
madame
paloque
who
had
just
been
questioning
him
upon
the
subject
has
chosen
angéline
i
believe
that
he
would
rather
have
had
aurélie
but
it
has
probably
been
hinted
to
him
that
it
would
not
be
seemly
for
the
younger
sister
to
be
married
before
the
elder
one
are
you
quite
sure
madame
paloque
murmured
maliciously
fancy
that
angéline
has
a
likeness
the
conservator
of
rivers
and
forests
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
with
a
smile
it
just
a
is
it
she
continued
will
strengthen
the
ties
between
the
two
families
we
are
all
good
friends
now
paloque
is
expecting
his
cross
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
everything
monsieur
delangre
did
not
arrive
till
late
he
received
as
newspaper
writers
say
a
perfect
ovation
madame
de
condamin
had
just
informed
doctor
porquier
that
his
son
guillaume
had
been
nominated
chief
clerk
at
the
she
was
circulating
good
news
through
the
room
declaring
that
abbé
bourrette
would
be
the
following
year
that
abbé
surin
would
be
a
bishop
before
he
was
forty
and
that
monsieur
maffre
was
to
have
a
cross
bourdeu
exclaimed
monsieur
rastoil
with
a
last
sigh
of
regret
there
no
occasion
to
pity
him
cried
madame
de
condamin
gaily
will
undertake
to
console
him
he
is
not
cut
out
for
the
chamber
what
he
wants
is
a
prefecture
tell
him
that
he
shall
have
one
before
long
the
merriment
increased
the
fair
octavie
high
spirits
and
the
desire
which
she
showed
to
please
everybody
delighted
the
company
it
was
really
she
who
was
doing
the
honours
of
the
she
was
the
queen
of
the
place
and
while
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
quite
playfully
she
gave
monsieur
delangre
the
most
practical
advice
in
the
world
about
the
part
he
ought
to
play
in
the
corps
législatif
she
took
him
aside
and
offered
to
introduce
him
to
several
influential
people
an
offer
which
he
gratefully
accepted
about
eleven
monsieur
de
condamin
suggested
that
the
garden
should
be
illuminated
but
his
wife
calmed
the
enthusiasm
of
the
gentlemen
and
said
that
such
a
course
would
be
inadvisable
for
it
would
not
do
to
appear
to
be
exulting
over
the
town
what
about
abbé
fenil
she
suddenly
asked
abbé
faujas
as
she
took
him
aside
into
one
of
the
window
recesses
has
not
made
any
movement
has
he
fenil
is
a
man
of
sense
the
priest
replied
has
been
hinted
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
not
to
interfere
in
political
matters
for
the
future
in
the
midst
of
all
the
triumphant
joy
abbé
faujas
remained
grave
he
had
won
after
a
hard
fight
madame
de
condamin
chatter
wearied
him
and
the
satisfaction
of
these
people
with
their
poor
vulgar
ambitions
filled
him
with
disdain
as
he
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
buried
in
thought
he
was
master
now
and
no
longer
compelled
to
veil
and
suppress
his
real
feelings
he
could
reach
out
his
hand
and
seize
the
town
and
make
it
tremble
in
his
grasp
his
tall
black
figure
seemed
to
fill
the
room
the
guests
gradually
drew
their
chairs
closer
to
him
and
formed
a
circle
round
him
the
men
awaited
some
expression
of
satisfaction
from
his
lips
the
women
besought
him
with
their
eyes
like
submissive
slaves
but
he
bluntly
broke
through
the
circle
and
went
away
the
first
saying
but
a
brief
word
or
two
as
he
took
his
leave
when
he
returned
to
the
mourets
house
going
thither
by
way
of
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
and
the
garden
he
found
marthe
alone
in
the
sitting
listlessly
on
a
chair
against
the
wall
looking
very
pale
and
gazing
with
a
blank
expression
at
the
lamp
the
wick
of
which
was
beginning
to
char
upstairs
trouche
was
having
a
party
and
could
be
heard
singing
a
broad
comic
song
which
olympe
and
his
guests
accompanied
by
striking
their
glasses
with
the
handles
of
their
knives
xx
abbé
faujas
laid
his
hand
on
marthe
shoulder
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
have
you
gone
to
bed
i
told
you
that
you
were
not
to
wait
for
me
she
started
up
and
stammered
thought
you
would
be
back
much
earlier
than
this
i
fell
asleep
i
dare
say
rose
will
have
got
some
tea
ready
the
priest
called
for
the
cook
and
rated
her
for
not
having
made
her
mistress
go
to
bed
he
spoke
in
authoritative
tones
that
admitted
of
no
reply
the
tea
for
his
reverence
rose
said
marthe
i
do
want
any
tea
the
priest
said
with
a
show
of
vexation
to
bed
immediately
it
is
absurd
i
can
scarcely
control
myself
show
me
a
light
rose
the
cook
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
staircase
reverence
knows
that
i
am
not
to
blame
she
said
is
very
strange
ill
as
she
is
she
ca
stop
for
a
single
hour
in
her
room
she
ca
keep
from
coming
and
going
up
and
down
and
fidgetting
about
merely
for
the
sake
of
being
on
the
move
she
puts
me
out
quite
as
much
as
anyone
else
she
is
always
in
my
way
preventing
me
from
getting
on
with
anything
then
she
drops
down
on
a
chair
and
sits
staring
in
front
of
her
with
a
terrified
look
as
though
she
could
see
something
horrible
i
told
her
half
a
score
of
times
at
least
that
you
would
be
very
angry
with
her
for
not
going
to
bed
but
she
did
even
seem
to
hear
what
i
said
the
priest
went
upstairs
without
replying
as
he
passed
the
room
he
stretched
out
his
arm
as
though
he
was
going
to
bang
his
fist
on
the
door
but
the
singing
had
stopped
and
he
could
tell
from
the
sounds
within
that
the
visitors
were
about
to
take
their
departure
so
he
quickly
stepped
into
his
own
room
almost
immediately
afterwards
trouche
went
downstairs
with
a
couple
of
men
whom
he
had
picked
up
in
some
low
café
crying
out
on
the
staircase
that
he
knew
how
to
behave
himself
and
was
going
to
see
them
home
olympe
leant
over
the
banisters
can
fasten
the
doors
she
said
to
rose
wo
be
back
before
morning
rose
from
whom
she
had
not
been
able
to
conceal
her
misconduct
expressed
much
pity
for
her
and
growled
as
she
fastened
the
doors
fools
women
are
to
get
married
their
husbands
either
beat
them
or
go
off
after
hussies
for
my
part
i
very
much
rather
keep
as
i
am
when
she
went
back
into
the
she
found
her
mistress
again
in
a
sort
of
melancholy
stupor
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
lamp
she
shook
her
and
made
her
go
upstairs
to
bed
marthe
had
become
very
timid
she
said
she
saw
great
patches
of
light
on
the
walls
of
her
room
at
and
heard
violent
blows
at
the
head
of
her
bed
rose
now
slept
near
her
in
a
little
whence
she
hastened
to
calm
her
at
the
slightest
uneasiness
that
night
she
had
not
finished
undressing
herself
before
she
heard
marthe
groaning
and
on
rushing
into
her
room
she
found
her
lying
amidst
the
disordered
her
eyes
staring
widely
in
mute
horror
and
her
clenched
fists
pressed
closely
against
her
mouth
to
keep
herself
from
shrieking
rose
was
obliged
to
talk
to
her
and
soothe
her
as
though
she
were
a
mere
child
and
even
had
to
look
behind
the
curtains
and
under
the
furniture
and
assure
her
that
she
was
mistaken
for
there
was
really
no
one
there
these
attacks
of
terror
ended
in
cataleptic
seizures
when
the
unhappy
woman
lay
back
on
her
pillow
with
her
eyelids
rigidly
opened
as
though
she
were
dead
is
the
thought
of
the
master
that
torments
her
rose
muttered
as
she
at
last
got
into
bed
the
next
day
was
one
of
those
when
doctor
porquier
called
he
came
regularly
twice
a
week
to
see
madame
mouret
he
patted
her
hands
and
said
to
her
with
his
amiable
optimism
nothing
serious
will
come
of
this
my
dear
lady
you
still
cough
a
little
do
you
ah
it
a
mere
cold
which
has
been
neglected
but
which
we
will
cure
with
some
syrups
but
marthe
complained
to
him
of
intolerable
pains
in
her
back
and
chest
and
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
as
if
trying
to
discover
from
his
face
and
manner
what
he
would
not
say
in
words
am
afraid
of
going
mad
she
suddenly
cried
breaking
into
a
sob
the
doctor
smilingly
reassured
her
the
sight
of
him
always
caused
her
keen
anxiety
she
felt
a
sort
of
alarm
of
this
gentle
and
agreeable
man
she
often
told
rose
not
to
admit
him
saying
that
she
was
not
ill
and
had
no
need
to
have
a
doctor
constantly
to
see
her
rose
shrugged
her
shoulders
however
and
ushered
the
doctor
into
the
room
however
he
had
almost
ceased
speaking
to
marthe
about
her
ailments
and
seemed
to
be
merely
making
friendly
calls
upon
her
as
he
was
going
away
he
met
abbé
faujas
who
was
returning
from
the
priest
questioned
him
respecting
madame
condition
is
sometimes
quite
powerless
said
the
doctor
gravely
the
goodness
of
providence
is
inexhaustible
the
poor
lady
has
been
sorely
shaken
but
i
do
altogether
give
her
up
her
chest
is
only
slightly
attacked
as
yet
and
the
climate
here
is
favourable
then
he
started
a
dissertation
upon
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
diseases
in
the
neighbourhood
of
plassans
he
was
preparing
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
not
for
publication
for
he
was
too
shrewd
to
wish
to
seem
a
but
for
the
perusal
of
a
few
intimate
friends
have
weighty
reasons
he
said
in
conclusion
believing
that
the
equable
temperature
the
aromatic
flora
and
the
salubrious
springs
of
our
hills
are
extremely
effective
for
the
cure
of
pulmonary
complaints
the
priest
had
listened
to
him
with
his
usual
stern
expression
are
mistaken
he
said
slowly
does
not
agree
with
madame
mouret
why
not
send
her
to
pass
the
winter
at
nice
nice
repeated
the
doctor
uneasily
he
looked
at
the
priest
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
in
his
complacent
way
certainly
would
be
very
suitable
for
her
in
her
present
condition
of
nervous
excitement
a
change
of
surroundings
would
probably
have
very
beneficial
results
i
must
advise
her
to
make
the
journey
it
is
an
excellent
idea
of
yours
monsieur
le
curé
he
bowed
parted
from
the
abbé
and
made
his
way
to
madame
de
condamin
whose
slightest
headaches
caused
him
endless
trouble
and
anxiety
at
dinner
the
next
day
marthe
spoke
of
the
doctor
in
almost
violent
terms
she
swore
that
she
would
never
allow
him
to
visit
her
again
is
he
who
is
making
me
ill
she
exclaimed
very
afternoon
he
has
been
advising
me
to
go
off
on
a
journey
i
entirely
agree
with
him
in
that
declared
abbé
faujas
folding
his
napkin
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
him
and
turned
very
pale
as
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
do
you
also
want
to
send
me
away
from
plassans
oh
i
should
die
in
a
strange
land
far
away
from
all
my
old
associations
and
far
away
from
those
i
love
the
priest
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
was
about
to
leave
the
he
stepped
towards
her
and
said
with
a
smile
friends
only
think
of
what
is
good
for
your
health
why
are
you
so
rebellious
i
do
want
to
go
i
do
want
to
go
she
cried
stepping
back
from
him
there
was
a
short
contest
between
them
the
blood
rushed
to
the
cheeks
and
he
crossed
his
arms
as
though
to
withstand
a
temptation
to
strike
marthe
she
was
leaning
against
the
wall
in
despair
at
her
weakness
then
quite
vanquished
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
stammered
beseech
you
to
allow
me
to
remain
here
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
then
as
she
burst
into
sobs
the
abbé
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
left
the
room
like
a
husband
fearing
an
outbreak
of
tears
madame
faujas
who
was
tranquilly
finishing
her
dinner
had
witnessed
the
scene
and
continued
eating
she
let
marthe
cry
on
undisturbed
are
extremely
unreasonable
my
dear
child
she
said
after
a
time
helping
herself
to
some
more
sweetmeats
will
end
by
making
ovide
quite
detest
you
you
do
know
how
to
treat
him
why
do
you
refuse
to
go
away
from
home
if
it
is
necessary
for
your
health
we
should
look
after
the
house
for
you
and
you
would
find
everything
all
right
and
in
its
place
when
you
came
back
marthe
was
still
sobbing
and
did
not
seem
to
hear
what
madame
faujas
said
has
so
much
to
think
about
the
old
lady
continued
you
know
that
he
often
works
till
four
in
the
morning
when
you
cough
all
through
the
night
it
disturbs
him
very
much
and
distracts
his
thoughts
he
ca
work
any
longer
and
he
suffers
more
than
you
do
do
this
for
ovide
sake
my
dear
child
go
away
and
come
back
to
us
in
good
health
then
marthe
raised
her
face
red
with
weeping
and
throwing
all
her
anguish
into
one
cry
she
wailed
heaven
lies
during
the
next
few
days
no
further
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
upon
madame
mouret
to
induce
her
to
make
the
journey
to
nice
she
grew
terribly
excited
at
the
least
reference
to
it
she
refused
to
leave
plassans
with
such
a
show
of
determination
that
the
priest
himself
recognised
the
danger
of
insisting
upon
the
scheme
in
the
midst
of
his
triumph
she
was
beginning
to
cause
him
terrible
anxiety
and
embarrassment
trouche
declared
with
his
snigger
that
it
was
she
who
ought
to
have
been
sent
the
first
to
les
tulettes
ever
since
mouret
had
been
taken
off
she
had
secluded
herself
in
the
practice
of
the
most
rigid
religious
practices
and
refrained
from
ever
mentioning
her
husband
name
praying
indeed
that
she
might
be
rendered
altogether
oblivious
of
the
past
but
she
still
remained
restless
and
returned
from
with
even
a
keener
longing
for
forgetfulness
than
she
had
had
when
she
went
thither
landlady
is
going
it
finely
olympe
said
to
her
husband
when
she
came
home
one
evening
went
with
her
to
church
and
i
had
to
pick
her
up
from
the
you
would
laugh
if
i
told
you
all
the
things
that
she
vomited
out
against
ovide
she
is
quite
furious
with
him
she
says
that
he
has
no
heart
and
that
he
has
deceived
her
in
promising
her
a
heap
of
consolations
and
you
should
hear
her
rail
too
against
the
divinity
ah
it
only
your
pious
people
who
talk
so
badly
of
religion
anyone
would
think
to
hear
her
that
god
had
cheated
her
of
a
large
sum
of
money
do
you
know
i
really
believe
that
her
husband
comes
and
haunts
her
at
night
trouche
was
much
amused
by
this
gossip
she
has
herself
to
blame
for
that
he
said
that
old
joker
mouret
was
put
away
it
was
her
own
doing
if
i
were
faujas
i
should
know
how
to
arrange
matters
and
i
would
make
her
as
gentle
and
content
as
a
sheep
but
faujas
is
an
ass
and
you
will
see
that
he
will
make
a
mess
of
the
business
your
brother
my
dear
has
shown
himself
sufficiently
pleasant
to
us
for
me
to
help
him
out
of
the
bother
i
shall
have
a
rare
laugh
the
day
our
landlady
makes
him
take
the
plunge
certainly
looks
down
upon
women
too
much
declared
olympe
then
trouche
continued
in
a
lower
tone
say
you
know
if
our
landlady
were
to
throw
herself
down
some
well
with
your
noodle
of
a
brother
we
should
be
the
masters
and
the
house
would
be
ours
we
should
be
able
to
feather
our
nest
nicely
then
it
would
be
a
splendid
ending
to
it
all
that
since
mouret
departure
the
trouches
also
had
invaded
the
of
the
house
olympe
had
begun
by
complaining
that
the
chimneys
upstairs
smoked
and
she
had
ended
by
persuading
marthe
that
the
which
had
hitherto
been
unoccupied
was
the
healthiest
room
in
the
house
rose
was
ordered
to
light
a
big
fire
there
and
the
two
women
spent
their
days
in
endless
talk
before
the
huge
blazing
logs
it
was
one
of
olympe
dreams
to
be
able
to
live
like
this
handsomely
dressed
and
lolling
on
a
couch
in
the
midst
of
an
elegantly
furnished
room
she
even
persuaded
marthe
to
have
the
to
buy
some
new
furniture
and
a
fresh
carpet
for
it
then
she
felt
that
she
was
a
lady
she
came
downstairs
in
her
slippers
and
and
talked
as
though
she
were
the
mistress
of
the
house
poor
madame
mouret
she
would
say
so
much
worry
that
she
has
asked
me
to
help
her
and
so
i
devote
a
little
of
my
time
to
assisting
her
it
is
really
a
kindness
to
do
so
she
had
indeed
quite
succeeded
in
winning
the
confidence
of
marthe
who
from
sheer
lassitude
handed
over
to
her
the
petty
details
of
the
household
management
it
was
olympe
who
kept
the
keys
of
the
cellar
and
the
cupboards
and
paid
the
tradesmen
bills
as
well
she
had
been
deliberating
for
a
long
time
as
to
how
she
should
manage
to
make
herself
equally
free
in
the
trouche
however
dissuaded
her
from
attempting
to
carry
out
that
design
they
would
no
longer
be
able
to
eat
and
drink
as
they
liked
he
said
they
would
not
even
dare
to
drink
their
wine
unwatered
or
to
ask
a
friend
to
come
and
have
coffee
then
olympe
declared
that
at
any
rate
she
would
bring
their
share
of
the
dessert
upstairs
she
crammed
her
pockets
with
sugar
and
she
even
carried
off
for
this
purpose
she
made
some
big
canvas
pockets
which
she
fastened
under
her
skirt
and
which
it
took
her
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
to
empty
every
evening
there
something
for
a
rainy
day
she
said
as
she
bundled
a
stock
of
provisions
into
a
box
which
she
then
pushed
under
the
bed
we
happen
to
fall
out
with
our
landlady
we
shall
have
something
to
keep
us
going
for
a
time
i
must
bring
up
some
pots
of
preserves
and
some
salt
pork
is
no
need
to
make
a
secret
of
it
said
trouche
i
were
you
i
should
make
rose
bring
them
up
as
you
are
the
mistress
trouche
had
made
himself
master
of
the
garden
for
a
long
time
past
he
had
envied
mouret
as
he
had
watched
him
pruning
his
trees
gravelling
his
walks
and
watering
his
lettuces
and
he
had
indulged
in
a
dream
of
one
day
having
a
plot
of
ground
of
his
own
where
he
might
dig
and
plant
as
he
liked
so
now
that
mouret
was
no
longer
there
he
took
possession
of
the
garden
planning
all
kinds
of
alterations
in
it
he
began
by
condemning
the
vegetables
he
had
a
delicate
soul
he
said
and
he
loved
flowers
but
the
labour
of
digging
tired
him
out
on
the
second
day
and
a
gardener
was
called
in
who
dug
up
the
beds
under
his
directions
threw
the
vegetables
on
to
the
and
prepared
the
soil
for
the
reception
of
pæonies
roses
and
lilies
larkspurs
and
convolvuli
and
cuttings
of
geraniums
and
carnations
then
an
idea
occurred
to
trouche
it
struck
him
that
the
tall
sombre
box
plants
which
bordered
the
beds
had
a
mournful
appearance
and
he
meditated
for
a
long
time
about
pulling
them
up
are
quite
right
said
olympe
whom
he
consulted
on
the
matter
make
the
place
look
like
a
cemetery
for
my
part
i
should
much
prefer
an
edging
of
made
to
resemble
rough
wood
i
will
persuade
the
landlady
to
have
it
done
anyhow
pull
up
the
box
the
box
was
accordingly
pulled
up
a
week
later
the
gardener
came
and
laid
down
the
edging

he
contented

for
the

we
sit
at

gave
her
consent
to
all
the
plans
that
were
submitted
to
her
and
in
the
end
he
gave
over
even
consulting
her
it
was
solely
madame
faujas
that
the
trouches
had
to
contend
against
and
she
continued
to
dispute
possession
of
the
house
with
them
very
obstinately
it
was
only
after
a
battle
royal
with
her
mother
that
olympe
had
been
able
to
take
possession
of
the
madame
faujas
had
all
but
won
the
day
on
that
occasion
it
was
the
fault
if
she
had
not
proved

of
a
sister

yours
says
everything
that
is
bad
of
us
to
the
landlady
madame
faujas
perpetually
complained
can
see
through
her
game
she
wants
to
supplant
us
and
to
get
everything
for
herself
she
is
trying
to
settle
herself
down
in
the
like
a
fine
lady
the
slut
the
priest
however
paid
no
attention
to
what
his
mother
said
he
only
broke
out
into
sharp
gestures
of
impatience
at
her
complaints
one
day
he
got
quite
angry
and
exclaimed
beg
of
you
mother
do
leave
me
in
peace
do
talk
to
me
any
more
about
olympe
or
trouche
let
them
go
and
hang
themselves
if
they
like
they
are
seizing
the
whole
house
ovide
they
are
perfect
rats
when
you
want
your
share
you
will
find
that
they
have
gnawed
it
all
away
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
keep
them
in
check
he
looked
at
his
mother
with
a
faint
smile
love
me
very
much
mother
said
he
i
forgive
you
make
your
mind
easy
i
want
something
very
different
from
the
house
it
mine
and
i
only
keep
what
i
gain
you
will
be
very
proud
when
you
see
my
share
trouche
has
been
useful
to
me
and
we
must
shut
our
eyes
a
little
madame
faujas
was
then
obliged
to
beat
a
retreat
but
she
did
so
with
very
bad
grace
the
absolute
disinterestedness
of
her
son
made
her
with
her
material
baser
desires
and
careful
economical
nature
quite
desperate
she
would
have
liked
to
lock
the
house
up
so
that
ovide
might
find
it
ready
in
perfect
order
for
his
occupation
whenever
he
might
want
it
the
trouches
with
their
grasping
ways
caused
her
all
the
torment
and
despair
felt
by
a
miser
who
is
being
preyed
upon
by
strangers
it
was
exactly
as
though
they
were
wasting
her
own
substance
fattening
upon
her
own
flesh
and
reducing
herself
and
her
beloved
son
to
penury
and
wretchedness
when
the
abbé
forbade
her
to
oppose
the
gradual
invasion
of
the
trouches
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
at
any
rate
save
all
she
could
from
the
hands
of
the
spoilers
and
so
she
began
pilfering
from
the
cupboards
just
as
olympe
did
she
also
fastened
big
pockets
underneath
her
skirts
and
had
a
chest
which
she
filled
with
all
the
things
she
collected
together
provisions
linen
and
miscellaneous
articles
is
that
you
are
stowing
away
there
mother
the
abbé
asked
one
evening
as
he
went
into
her
room
attracted
by
the
noise
which
she
made
in
moving
the
chest
she
began
to
stammer
out
a
reply
but
the
priest
understood
it
all
at
a
glance
and
flew
into
a
violent
rage
is
too
shameful
he
said
have
turned
yourself
into
a
thief
now
what
would
the
consequences
be
if
you
were
to
be
detected
i
should
be
the
talk
of
the
whole
town
is
all
for
your
sake
ovide
she
murmured
thief
my
mother
a
thief
perhaps
you
think
that
i
thieve
too
that
i
have
come
here
to
plunder
and
that
my
only
ambition
is
to
lay
my
hands
upon
whatever
i
can
good
heavens
what
sort
of
an
opinion
have
you
formed
of
me
we
shall
have
to
separate
mother
if
we
do
not
understand
each
other
better
than
this
this
speech
quite
crushed
the
old
woman
she
had
remained
on
her
knees
in
front
of
the
chest
and
she
sank
into
a
crouching
position
upon
the
floor
very
pale
and
almost
choking
and
stretching
out
her
hands
beseechingly
when
she
was
able
to
speak
she
wailed
out
is
for
your
benefit
my
child
for
yours
only
i
swear
i
have
told
you
before
that
they
are
taking
everything
your
sister
crams
everything
into
her
pockets
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
you
not
even
a
lump
of
sugar
but
i
wo
take
anything
more
since
it
makes
you
angry
and
you
will
let
me
stay
with
you
wo
you
you
will
keep
me
with
you
wo
you
abbé
faujas
refused
to
make
any
promises
until
she
had
restored
everything
she
had
taken
to
its
place
for
nearly
a
week
he
himself
superintended
the
secret
restoration
of
the
contents
of
the
chest
he
watched
his
mother
fill
her
pockets
and
waited
till
she
came
back
upstairs
again
to
take
a
fresh
load
for
prudential
reasons
he
allowed
her
to
make
only
two
journeys
backwards
and
forwards
every
evening
the
old
woman
felt
as
though
her
heart
was
breaking
as
she
restored
each
article
to
its
former
place
she
did
not
dare
to
cry
but
her
eyelids
were
swollen
with
tears
of
regret
and
her
hands
trembled
even
more
than
they
had
done
when
they
were
ransacking
the
cupboards
however
what
afflicted
her
more
than
anything
else
was
to
see
that
as
soon
as
she
had
restored
each
article
to
its
rightful
position
olympe
followed
in
her
wake
and
took
possession
of
it
the
linen
the
provisions
and
the
merely
passed
from
one
pocket
to
another
wo
take
anything
more
downstairs
she
exclaimed
to
her
son
growing
rebellious
at
this
unforeseen
result
of
her
restorations
is
the
least
good
for
your
sister
only
walks
off
with
everything
directly
i
put
it
back
the
hussy
i
might
just
as
well
give
her
the
chest
at
once
she
must
have
got
a
nice
little
hoard
together
i
beseech
you
ovide
let
me
keep
what
still
remains
our
landlady
will
be
none
the
worse
off
for
it
because
she
will
lose
it
anyhow
sister
is
what
she
is
the
priest
replied
tranquilly
i
wish
my
mother
to
be
an
honest
woman
you
will
help
me
much
more
by
not
committing
such
actions
she
was
forced
to
restore
everything
and
from
that
time
forward
she
harboured
fierce
hatred
against
the
trouches
marthe
and
the
whole
establishment
she
often
said
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
should
have
to
defend
ovide
against
everybody
the
trouches
were
now
reigning
in
all
sovereignty
they
completed
the
conquest
of
the
house
and
made
their
way
into
every
corner
of
it
the
abbé
own
rooms
were
the
only
ones
they
respected
it
was
only
before
him
that
they
trembled
but
even
his
presence
in
the
house
did
not
prevent
them
from
inviting
their
friends
and
indulging
in
debauches
till
two
in
the
morning
guillaume
porquier
came
with
parties
of
mere
youths
olympe
notwithstanding
her
years
then
simpered
and
put
on
girlish
airs
and
flirted
with
more
than
one
of
the
college
lads
the
house
was
becoming
a
perfect
paradise
to
her
trouche
sniggered
and
joked
about
it
when
they
were
alone
together
she
said
quite
tranquilly
do
as
you
like
do
you
we
are
both
free
to
do
as
we
please
you
know
trouche
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
but
brought
his
pleasant
life
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
there
had
been
an
unpleasant
affair
at
the
home
of
the
virgin
in
connection
with
one
of
the
girls
there
one
of
the
sisters
of
joseph
had
complained
of
trouche
to
abbé
faujas
he
had
thanked
her
for
telling
him
and
had
impressed
upon
her
that
the
cause
of
religion
would
suffer
by
such
a
scandal
so
the
affair
was
hushed
up
and
the
lady
patronesses
never
had
the
faintest
suspicion
of
it
abbé
faujas
however
had
a
terrible
scene
with
his
whom
he
assailed
in
olympe
presence
so
that
his
wife
might
have
a
weapon
against
him
and
be
able
to
keep
him
in
check
the
trouches
had
been
troubled
for
a
long
time
past
by
another
matter
notwithstanding
their
life
of
clover
although
they
were
provided
with
so
many
things
out
of
marthe
cupboards
they
had
got
terribly
into
debt
in
the
neighbourhood
trouche
squandered
his
salary
away
in
cafés
and
olympe
wasted
the
money
which
she
drew
out
of
marthe
pockets
by
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
silly
fancies
as
for
the
necessaries
of
life
they
made
a
point
of
getting
these
upon
credit
there
was
one
account
which
made
them
particularly
uneasy
that
of
a
pastrycook
in
the
rue
de
la
banne
which
amounted
to
more
than
a
hundred
francs
for
the
pastrycook
was
a
rough
blunt
sort
of
man
who
had
threatened
to
lay
the
whole
matter
before
abbé
faujas
the
trouches
thus
long
lived
in
a
state
of
alarm
but
when
the
bill
was
actually
presented
to
him
abbé
faujas
paid
it
without
a
word
and
even
forgot
to
address
any
reproaches
to
them
on
the
subject
the
priest
seemed
to
be
above
all
those
sordid
little
matters
and
went
on
living
a
gloomy
and
rigid
life
in
this
house
that
was
given
up
to
pillage
without
appearing
conscious
of
the
gradual
ruin
which
was
falling
upon
it
everything
indeed
was
crumbling
away
around
him
while
he
continued
to
advance
straight
towards
the
goal
of
his
ambition
he
still
camped
like
a
soldier
in
his
big
bare
room
indulging
in
no
comforts
and
showing
annoyance
when
any
were
pressed
upon
him
since
he
had
become
the
master
of
plassans
he
had
dropped
back
into
complete
carelessness
as
to
his
appearance
his
hat
became
rusty
his
stockings
muddy
his
cassock
which
his
mother
mended
every
morning
looked
just
like
the
pitiful
rag
which
he
had
worn
when
he
first
came
to
plassans
it
is
very
good
yet
he
used
to
say
when
anyone
hazarded
a
timid
remark
about
it
he
made
a
display
of
it
walked
about
the
streets
in
it
carrying
his
head
loftily
and
altogether
unheeding
the
curious
glances
which
were
cast
at
him
there
was
no
bravado
in
the
matter
he
was
simply
following
his
natural
inclinations
now
that
he
believed
that
he
need
no
longer
lay
himself
out
to
please
he
fell
back
into
all
his
old
disdain
for
mere
appearance
it
was
his
triumph
to
sit
down
just
as
he
was
with
his
tall
clumsy
body
rough
blunt
manner
and
torn
clothes
in
the
midst
of
conquered
plassans
madame
de
condamin
distressed
by
the
strong
smell
which
emanated
from
his
cassock
one
day
gently
took
him
to
task
about
his
appearance
you
know
she
said
to
him
laughing
the
ladies
are
beginning
to
detest
you
they
say
that
you
now
never
take
the
least
trouble
over
your
toilet
once
upon
a
time
when
you
took
your
handkerchief
out
of
your
pocket
it
was
just
as
though
there
were
a
swinging
a
thurible
behind
you
the
priest
looked
greatly
astonished
he
was
quite
unaware
of
any
change
in
himself
then
madame
de
condamin
drawing
a
little
nearer
to
him
said
in
a
friendly
tone
you
let
me
speak
quite
frankly
to
you
my
dear
curé
it
is
really
a
mistake
on
your
part
to
be
so
negligent
of
your
appearance
you
scarcely
shave
and
you
never
comb
your
hair
it
is
as
rough
and
tumbled
as
though
you
had
been
fighting
i
can
assure
you
that
all
this
has
a
very
bad
effect
madame
rastoil
and
madame
delangre
told
me
yesterday
that
they
could
scarcely
recognise
you
you
are
really
compromising
your
success
the
priest
gave
a
laugh
of
defiance
as
he
shook
his
powerful
unkempt
head
that
the
battle
is
won
he
merely
replied
must
put
up
with
my
hair
being
uncombed
plassans
had
indeed
to
put
up
with
him
with
his
hair
uncombed
the
once
seemingly
flexible
priest
was
now
transformed
into
a
stern
despotic
master
who
bent
all
wills
to
his
own
his
face
which
had
again
become
cadaverous
in
hue
shone
with
eyes
like
an
eagle
and
he
raised
his
big
hands
as
though
they
were
filled
with
threats
and
chastisements
the
town
was
positively
terrified
on
beholding
the
master
it
had
imposed
upon
itself
with
his
shabby
dirty
clothing
and
unkempt
hair
the
covert
alarm
of
the
women
only
tended
however
to
strengthen
his
power
he
was
stern
and
harsh
to
his
penitents
but
not
one
of
them
dared
to
leave
him
they
came
to
him
in
fear
and
trembling
in
which
they
found
some
touch
of
painful
pleasure
was
wrong
my
dear
madame
de
condamin
confessed
to
marthe
wanting
him
to
perfume
himself
i
am
growing
accustomed
to
him
and
even
prefer
him
as
he
is
he
is
indeed
a
man
abbé
faujas
was
supreme
at
the
bishop
since
the
elections
he
had
left
monseigneur
rousselot
only
a
show
of
authority
the
bishop
lived
amidst
his
beloved
books
in
his
study
where
the
abbé
who
administered
the
diocese
from
an
adjoining
room
virtually
kept
him
prisoner
only
allowing
him
to
see
those
persons
whom
he
could
fully
trust
the
clergy
trembled
before
this
absolute
master
the
old
priests
bent
before
him
with
all
humility
and
surrender
of
personal
will
monseigneur
rousselot
when
he
was
alone
with
abbé
surin
often
wept
silent
tears
he
regretted
the
impetuous
mastery
of
abbé
fenil
who
had
at
any
rate
intervals
of
affectionate
softness
whereas
now
under
abbé
faujas
rule
he
felt
a
relentless
ceaseless
pressure
however
he
would
smile
again
and
resign
himself
saying
with
a
sort
of
pleasant
my
child
let
us
get
to
work
i
must
not
complain
for
i
am
now
leading
the
life
which
i
always
dreamed
of
a
life
of
perfect
solitude
amongst
my
books
then
he
sighed
and
continued
in
a
lower
tone
should
be
quite
happy
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
losing
you
my
dear
surin
he
will
end
by
not
tolerating
your
presence
here
any
longer
i
thought
that
he
looked
at
you
very
suspiciously
yesterday
always
agree
with
him
i
beseech
you
take
his
side
and
do
spare
me
ah
me
i
have
only
you
left
now
two
months
after
the
elections
abbé
vial
one
of
the
went
to
settle
at
rome
abbé
faujas
stepped
into
his
place
as
a
matter
of
course
although
it
had
been
promised
long
ago
to
abbé
bourrette
he
did
not
even
promote
the
latter
to
the
living
of
which
he
vacated
but
preferred
to
it
a
young
ambitious
priest
whom
he
had
made
a
tool
of
his
own
lordship
would
not
hear
of
you
he
said
curtly
to
abbé
bourrette
when
he
met
him
when
the
poor
old
priest
stammered
out
that
he
would
go
and
see
the
bishop
and
ask
for
an
explanation
abbé
faujas
added
more
gently
lordship
is
too
unwell
to
see
you
trust
yourself
in
my
hands
i
will
plead
your
cause
for
you
from
his
first
appearance
in
the
chamber
in
paris
monsieur
delangre
had
voted
with
the
majority
plassans
was
conquered
for
the
empire
abbé
faujas
almost
seemed
actuated
by
a
feeling
of
revenge
in
the
rough
way
in
which
he
treated
the
prudent
townspeople
he
again
closed
the
little
doors
that
led
into
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
and
compelled
monsieur
rastoil
and
his
friends
to
enter
the
by
the
official
door
facing
the
place
when
he
appeared
at
the
friendly
gatherings
the
guests
showed
themselves
very
humble
in
his
presence
so
great
was
the
fascination
he
exercised
and
so
great
the
fear
he
inspired
that
even
when
he
was
not
present
nobody
dared
to
make
the
slightest
equivocal
remark
concerning
him
is
a
man
of
the
greatest
merit
declared
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
who
now
counted
on
being
promoted
to
a
prefecture
very
remarkable
man
indeed
chimed
in
doctor
porquier
all
the
company
nodded
their
heads
approvingly
till
monsieur
de
condamin
who
began
to
feel
irritated
by
this
eulogistic
unanimity
amused
himself
by
putting
them
into
embarrassment
he
has
a
pleasant
temper
anyway
said
he
this
remark
had
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
company
each
was
afraid
that
his
neighbour
might
be
in
the
terrible
abbé
pay
has
an
excellent
heart
monsieur
rastoil
prudently
remarked
like
all
great
minds
he
appears
at
first
sight
to
be
a
little
stern
is
just
so
with
me
i
am
very
easy
to
get
on
with
but
i
have
always
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
hard
stern
man
exclaimed
monsieur
de
bourdeu
who
had
become
reconciled
with
the
party
again
after
a
long
private
interview
which
he
had
had
with
abbé
faujas
then
wishing
to
put
everyone
at
ease
again
the
presiding
judge
exclaimed
you
heard
that
there
is
a
probability
of
a
bishopric
for
the
at
this
they
brightened
up
monsieur
maffre
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
of
plassans
itself
that
abbé
faujas
would
become
bishop
after
the
retirement
of
monseigneur
rousselot
whose
health
was
very
feeble
would
gain
by
it
said
abbé
bourrette
guilelessly
has
embittered
his
lordship
i
know
that
our
excellent
faujas
has
made
the
greatest
efforts
to
persuade
him
out
of
certain
unjust
prejudices
which
he
entertains
is
very
fond
of
you
asserted
judge
paloque
who
had
just
received
his
decoration
wife
has
heard
him
complain
of
the
way
in
which
you
are
neglected
when
abbé
surin
was
present
he
too
joined
in
the
general
chorus
but
although
he
had
a
mitre
in
his
pocket
to
use
the
expression
of
the
priests
of
the
diocese
the
success
of
abbé
faujas
made
him
uneasy
he
looked
at
him
in
his
pretty
way
and
calling
to
mind
the
prediction
tried
to
discover
the
weak
point
which
would
bring
that
colossus
toppling
in
the
dust
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
it
should
be
said
had
had
their
desires
satisfied
that
is
excepting
monsieur
de
bourdeu
and
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
who
were
still
waiting
for
the
marks
of
the
favour
these
two
were
consequently
the
warmest
partisans
of
abbé
faujas
the
others
to
tell
the
truth
would
have
been
glad
to
rebel
if
they
had
dared
they
were
growing
secretly
weary
of
the
continual
gratitude
which
was
exacted
from
them
by
their
master
and
they
ardently
wished
that
some
strong
bold
hand
would
effect
their
deliverance
one
day
madame
paloque
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
inquired
has
become
of
abbé
fenil
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
him
for
an
age
there
was
profound
silence
monsieur
de
condamin
was
the
only
one
present
capable
of
venturing
upon
such
dangerous
ground
they
all
looked
at
him
he
said
quietly
believe
he
shuts
himself
up
at
his
place
at
les
tulettes
madame
de
condamin
added
with
an
ironical
smile
can
sleep
quietly
now
his
career
is
over
he
will
take
no
part
again
in
the
affairs
of
plassans
there
was
only
marthe
who
remained
a
real
obstacle
in
abbé
path
he
felt
that
she
was
escaping
him
more
and
more
each
day
he
stiffened
his
will
and
called
up
all
his
forces
as
priest
and
man
to
bend
her
without
succeeding
in
moderating
the
flame
which
he
had
fanned
into
life
she
was
striving
to
reach
the
logical
end
of
her
passionate
longings
and
insisted
upon
forcing
her
way
further
and
further
into
the
peace
and
ecstasy
and
perfect
of
divine
happiness
it
was
bitter
pain
and
anguish
to
her
to
be
as
it
were
walled
in
and
prevented
from
reaching
that
threshold
of
light
of
which
she
fancied
she
caught
a
glimpse
though
it
seemed
to
be
ever
receding
from
her
reach
she
shivered
and
trembled
now
at
in
the
coldness
and
the
gloom
amidst
which
she
had
once
felt
such
thrills
of
delight
the
peals
of
the
organ
no
longer
stirred
her
with
a
tremor
of
voluptuous
joy
the
white
clouds
of
incense
no
longer
lulled
her
into
sweet
mystic
dreams
the
gleaming
chapels
and
the
sacred
pyxes
that
flashed
like
stars
the
chasubles
with
their
sheen
of
gold
and
silver
all
now
seemed
pale
and
wan
to
her
eyes
that
were
dull
and
dim
with
tears
like
a
damned
soul
yearning
after
paradise
she
threw
up
her
arms
in
bitter
desperation
and
besought
the
love
that
denied
itself
to
her
sobbing
and
wailing
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
bowed
down
with
shame
hurt
as
it
were
by
the
cold
silence
of
the
vaulted
roof
marthe
left
the
church
burning
with
the
anger
of
a
scorned
woman
she
had
wild
dreams
of
pouring
out
her
blood
and
she
writhed
madly
at
her
impotence
to
do
more
than
to
pray
at
being
unable
to
spring
at
a
single
bound
into
the
arms
of
god
and
when
she
returned
home
she
felt
that
her
only
hope
was
in
abbé
faujas
it
was
he
alone
that
could
make
her
god
he
had
revealed
to
her
the
initiatory
joys
he
must
now
tear
aside
the
whole
veil
but
the
priest
fell
into
a
passion
with
her
and
treated
her
roughly
refusing
to
hear
her
so
long
as
she
was
not
on
her
knees
before
him
humble
and
unresisting
like
a
corpse
she
listened
to
him
standing
upright
sustained
by
an
impulse
of
revolt
that
thrilled
her
whole
being
as
she
vented
upon
him
the
bitterness
that
came
of
her
deceived
yearnings
and
accused
him
of
the
base
treachery
which
was
torturing
her
old
madame
rougon
often
thought
it
was
her
duty
to
intervene
between
the
abbé
and
her
daughter
as
she
had
formerly
done
between
the
latter
and
mouret
marthe
having
told
her
of
her
troubles
she
spoke
to
the
priest
like
a
desiring
the
happiness
of
her
children
and
doing
her
best
to
restore
peace
in
their
home
she
said
to
him
with
a
smile
you
manage
to
live
in
peace
marthe
is
constantly
complaining
and
you
seem
to
be
perpetually
grieving
her
i
know
very
well
that
women
are
exacting
but
you
must
confess
that
you
are
a
little
wanting
in
consideration
i
am
extremely
distressed
by
what
occurs
it
would
be
so
easy
for
you
to
arrange
matters
pleasantly
do
i
beg
of
you
my
dear
abbé
be
a
little
more
gentle
with
her
she
also
scolded
him
in
a
friendly
fashion
for
his
slovenly
appearance
she
could
see
with
her
shrewd
feminine
intelligence
that
he
was
abusing
his
victory
then
she
began
to
make
excuses
for
her
daughter
the
dear
child
she
said
had
suffered
a
great
deal
and
her
nervous
sensitiveness
required
most
careful
treatment
but
she
had
an
excellent
disposition
and
an
affectionate
nature
which
a
clever
man
might
mould
after
his
own
wishes
one
day
however
when
she
was
thus
showing
him
how
he
might
make
marthe
what
he
liked
abbé
faujas
grew
weary
of
her
perpetual
advice
no
he
cried
daughter
is
mad
she
bores
me
to
death
i
wo
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
i
would
pay
the
fellow
well
who
would
free
me
of
her
madame
rougon
looked
him
keenly
in
the
face
and
tightly
pressed
her
lips
to
me
my
friend
she
said
after
a
short
silence
are
wanting
in
tact
and
that
will
prove
your
ruin
overthrow
yourself
if
you
like
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
i
assisted
you
not
for
your
own
sake
but
to
please
our
friends
in
paris
they
wrote
to
me
and
asked
me
to
pilot
you
and
i
did
so
but
understand
this
i
will
never
allow
you
to
come
the
master
over
me
it
all
very
well
for
little
péqueur
and
simple
rastoil
but
we
are
not
at
all
afraid
of
you
and
we
mean
to
remain
the
masters
my
husband
conquered
plassans
before
you
did
and
i
warn
you
that
we
shall
keep
our
conquest
from
that
day
forward
there
was
great
coldness
between
the
rougons
and
abbé
faujas
when
marthe
again
came
to
complain
to
her
mother
the
latter
said
to
her
very
plainly
abbé
is
only
making
a
fool
of
you
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
hesitate
to
tell
him
a
few
plain
truths
to
begin
with
he
has
been
disgustingly
dirty
for
a
long
time
past
and
i
understand
how
you
can
bear
to
take
your
meals
at
the
same
table
with
him
madame
rougon
had
in
truth
hinted
at
a
very
ingenious
plan
to
her
husband
by
which
the
abbé
should
be
ousted
and
they
themselves
should
reap
the
reward
of
his
success
now
that
the
town
voted
properly
rougon
who
had
not
cared
to
risk
the
conduct
of
the
campaign
was
quite
able
to
keep
it
in
the
proper
path
the
green
would
become
all
the
more
influential
and
félicité
began
to
await
developments
with
that
crafty
patience
to
which
she
owed
her
fortune
on
the
day
when
her
mother
told
her
that
the
abbé
was
only
making
a
fool
of
her
marthe
again
repaired
to
resolved
upon
a
last
supreme
appeal
she
remained
in
the
deserted
church
for
two
hours
pouring
out
her
soul
in
prayer
waiting
longingly
for
the
ecstasy
that
came
not
and
torturing
herself
with
her
search
for
consolation
impulses
of
deep
humility
stretched
her
prostrate
upon
the
momentary
thrills
of
rebellion
made
her
start
up
again
with
her
teeth
clenched
while
her
whole
being
wildly
racked
and
strained
broke
down
at
not
being
able
to
grasp
or
kiss
aught
save
the
aching
void
of
her
own
passion
when
she
rose
and
left
the
church
the
sky
seemed
black
to
her
she
was
not
conscious
of
the
pavement
beneath
her
feet
the
narrow
streets
left
upon
her
the
impression
of
some
immense
lonely
wilderness
she
threw
her
hat
and
shawl
upon
the
table
and
went
straight
upstairs
to
abbé
faujas
room
the
abbé
sat
buried
in
thought
at
his
little
table
his
pen
had
fallen
from
his
fingers
he
opened
the
door
still
full
of
his
thoughts
but
when
he
saw
marthe
standing
before
him
very
pale
and
with
the
light
of
deep
resolution
burning
in
her
eyes
he
made
a
gesture
of
anger
do
you
want
he
asked
have
you
come
upstairs
go
down
again
and
wait
for
me
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
she
pushed
him
aside
and
entered
the
room
without
speaking
a
word
the
priest
hesitated
for
a
moment
struggling
against
the
influence
which
was
prompting
him
to
raise
his
hand
against
her
he
remained
standing
in
front
of
her
without
closing
the
door
that
was
wide
open
do
you
want
he
repeated
am
busy
then
marthe
closed
the
door
and
having
done
so
drew
nearer
to
the
abbé
and
said
to
him
want
to
speak
to
you
she
sat
down
and
looked
about
the
room
at
the
narrow
bed
the
shabby
chest
of
drawers
and
at
the
big
black
wooden
crucifix
the
sight
of
which
as
it
stood
out
conspicuously
on
the
bare
wall
gave
her
a
passing
thrill
a
freezing
silence
seemed
to
fall
from
the
ceiling
the
grate
was
quite
empty
there
was
not
even
a
pinch
of
ashes
in
it
will
take
cold
said
the
priest
in
a
calmer
voice
us
go
downstairs
i
beg
you
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
marthe
again
then
clasping
her
hands
together
like
a
penitent
making
her
confession
she
continued
owe
you
much
before
you
came
i
was
without
a
soul
it
was
you
who
willed
that
i
should
be
saved
it
is
through
you
that
i
have
known
the
only
joys
of
my
life
you
are
my
saviour
and
my
father
for
these
last
five
years
i
have
only
lived
through
you
and
for
you
her
voice
broke
down
and
she
almost
slipped
upon
her
knees
the
priest
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
now
she
cried
am
suffering
and
have
need
of
your
help
listen
to
me
father
do
not
withdraw
from
me
you
can
not
abandon
me
thus
i
tell
you
that
god
does
not
listen
to
me
any
longer
i
do
not
feel
his
presence
any
longer
have
pity
upon
me
i
beseech
you
advise
me
lead
me
to
those
divine
graces
whose
first
joys
you
made
me
know
teach
me
what
i
should
do
to
cure
myself
and
ever
advance
in
the
love
of
god
must
pray
said
the
priest
gravely
have
prayed
i
have
prayed
for
hours
with
my
head
buried
in
my
hands
trying
to
lose
myself
in
every
word
of
adoration
and
yet
i
have
not
received
consolation
i
have
not
felt
the
presence
of
god
must
pray
and
pray
again
pray
continually
pray
until
god
is
moved
by
your
prayers
and
descends
to
you
she
looked
at
him
in
anguish
there
is
nothing
but
prayer
she
asked
can
not
give
me
any
help
none
at
all
he
replied
roughly
she
threw
up
her
trembling
hands
in
a
burst
of
desperation
her
breast
heaving
with
anger
but
she
restrained
herself
and
she
stammered
heaven
is
fast
closed
you
have
led
me
on
so
far
only
to
crush
me
against
a
wall
i
was
very
peaceful
you
will
remember
when
you
came
i
was
living
quietly
at
home
here
without
a
single
desire
or
curiosity
it
was
you
who
awoke
me
with
words
that
stirred
and
roused
my
heart
it
was
you
who
made
me
enter
upon
a
fresh
youth
oh
you
can
not
tell
what
joys
you
brought
me
at
first
it
was
like
sweet
soft
warmth
thrilling
my
whole
being
my
heart
woke
up
within
me
i
was
filled
with
mighty
hopes
sometimes
when
i
reflected
that
i
was
forty
years
old
it
all
seemed
foolish
to
me
and
i
smiled
and
then
i
defended
myself
for
i
felt
so
happy
in
it
all
now
i
want
the
promised
happiness
i
am
growing
weary
of
the
desire
for
it
a
desire
that
burns
me
and
tortures
me
i
have
no
time
to
lose
now
that
my
health
has
broken
down
and
i
do
want
to
find
myself
deceived
and
duped
there
must
be
something
more
tell
me
that
there
is
something
more
abbé
faujas
stood
quite
impassive
letting
this
flood
of
words
pass
without
reply
so
there
is
nothing
else
there
is
nothing
else
she
continued
in
a
burst
of
indignation
you
have
deceived
me
down
there
on
the
terrace
on
those
evenings
you
promised
me
heaven
and
i
believed
your
promises
i
sold
myself
and
gave
myself
up
i
was
quite
mad
during
those
first
transports
of
prayer
the
bargain
holds
no
longer
i
shall
return
to
my
old
ways
and
resume
my
old
peaceful
quiet
i
will
turn
everybody
out
of
the
house
and
make
it
as
it
used
to
be
i
will
again
sit
in
my
old
corner
on
the
terrace
and
mend
the
linen
needlework
never
wearies
me
and
i
will
have
désirée
back
to
sit
beside
me
on
her
little
stool
she
used
to
sit
there
the
dear
innocent
and
laugh
and
make
dolls
then
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
want
my
children
they
were
my
safeguard
since
they
left
i
have
lost
my
head
i
have
done
things
that
i
ought
not
to
have
done
why
did
you
take
them
from
me
they
went
away
from
me
one
by
one
and
the
house
became
like
a
strange
house
to
me
my
heart
was
no
longer
wrapped
up
in
it
i
was
glad
when
i
left
it
for
an
afternoon
and
when
i
came
back
in
the
evening
i
seemed
to
have
fallen
amongst
strangers
the
very
furniture
seemed
cold
and
unfriendly
i
quite
hated
the
house
but
i
will
go
and
fetch
them
again
the
poor
darlings
everything
will
become
as
it
used
to
be
directly
they
return
oh
if
i
could
only
sink
down
again
into
my
old
sleepy
quiet
she
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
the
priest
tried
to
calm
her
by
a
method
which
he
had
often
before
found
efficacious
calm
my
dear
lady
be
calm
he
said
trying
to
take
her
hands
and
hold
them
between
his
own
touch
me
she
cried
recoiling
from
him
do
want
you
to
do
so
when
you
hold
me
i
am
as
weak
as
a
child
the
warmth
of
your
hands
takes
all
my
resolution
and
strength
away
the
trouble
would
only
begin
again
for
i
can
not
go
on
living
like
this
and
you
only
assuage
me
for
an
hour
a
deep
shadow
passed
over
her
face
as
she
continued
i
am
damned
now
i
shall
never
love
my
home
again
and
if
the
children
come
they
would
ask
for
their
father
oh
it
is
that
which
is
killing
me
i
shall
never
be
forgiven
till
i
have
confessed
my
crime
to
a
priest
then
she
fell
upon
her
knees
am
a
guilty
woman
that
is
why
god
turns
his
face
from
me
abbé
faujas
tried
to
make
her
rise
from
her
knees
silent
he
cried
loudly
can
not
hear
your
confession
here
come
to
she
said
entreatingly
pity
upon
me
i
shall
not
have
the
strength
for
it
forbid
you
to
speak
he
cried
more
violently
than
before
listen
to
anything
i
shall
turn
my
head
away
and
close
my
ears
he
stepped
backward
and
crossed
his
arms
trying
to
check
the
confession
that
was
on
marthe
lips
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
with
the
lurking
anger
that
came
from
their
conscious
complicity
is
not
a
priest
who
listens
to
you
said
the
abbé
in
a
huskier
voice
there
is
only
a
man
to
judge
and
condemn
you
at
this
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
continued
feverishly
man
i
prefer
it
for
i
am
not
confessing
i
am
simply
telling
you
of
my
after
the
children
had
gone
i
allowed
their
father
to
be
put
away
too
he
had
never
struck
me
the
unhappy
man
it
was
i
myself
who
was
mad
oh
you
can
not
guess
what
frightful
nightmares
overwhelmed
me
and
made
me
hurl
myself
upon
the
floor
all
hell
seemed
to
be
racking
my
brain
with
its
torments
he
poor
man
with
his
chattering
teeth
excited
my
pity
it
was
he
who
was
afraid
of
me
when
you
had
left
the
room
he
dared
not
venture
near
me
he
passed
the
night
on
a
chair
again
did
abbé
faujas
try
to
stop
her
are
killing
yourself
he
exclaimed
stir
up
these
recollections
god
will
take
count
of
your
sufferings
was
i
who
sent
him
to
les
tulettes
she
continued
silencing
the
priest
with
an
energetic
gesture
all
told
me
that
he
was
mad
oh
the
unendurable
life
i
have
led
i
have
always
been
terrified
by
the
thought
of
madness
when
i
was
quite
young
i
used
to
feel
as
though
my
skull
were
being
opened
and
my
head
were
being
emptied
i
seemed
to
have
a
block
of
ice
within
my
brow
ah
i
felt
that
awful
coldness
again
and
i
was
perpetually
in
fear
of
going
mad
they
took
my
husband
away
i
let
them
take
him
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
but
ever
since
that
day
i
have
been
unable
to
close
my
eyes
without
seeing
him
over
yonder
it
is
that
which
makes
me
behave
so
strangely
which
roots
me
for
hours
to
the
same
spot
with
my
eyes
wide
open
i
know
the
place
i
can
see
it
my
uncle
macquart
showed
it
to
me
it
is
as
gloomy
as
a
prison
with
its
black
windows
she
seemed
to
be
choking
she
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
when
she
took
it
away
again
it
was
spotted
with
blood
the
priest
with
his
arms
rigidly
crossed
in
front
of
him
waited
till
the
attack
was
over
know
it
all
do
you
she
resumed
in
stammering
accents
am
a
miserable
guilty
woman
i
sinned
for
you
but
give
me
life
give
me
happiness
i
entreat
you
lie
said
the
priest
slowly
know
nothing
i
was
ignorant
that
you
were
guilty
of
that
wickedness
she
recoiled
clasping
her
hands
stammering
and
gazing
at
him
with
a
look
of
terror
and
at
last
utterly
unable
to
restrain
herself
she
broke
out
wildly
and
recklessly
me
ovide
i
love
you
and
you
know
that
i
do
do
you
not
i
have
loved
you
ovide
since
the
first
day
you
came
here
i
refrained
from
telling
you
so
for
i
saw
it
displeased
you
but
i
knew
quite
well
that
you
were
gaining
my
whole
heart
then
it
was
that
i
emptied
the
house
for
your
sake
i
dragged
myself
on
my
knees
and
became
your
slave
you
surely
can
not
go
on
being
cruel
for
ever
now
that
i
am
ill
and
abandoned
and
my
heart
is
broken
and
my
head
seems
empty
you
surely
can
not
reject
me
it
is
true
that
we
have
said
nothing
openly
before
but
surely
my
love
spoke
to
you
and
your
silence
made
answer
oh
i
love
you
ovide
i
love
you
and
it
is
killing
me
she
burst
into
another
fit
of
sobbing
abbé
faujas
had
braced
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
stepped
towards
marthe
and
poured
out
upon
her
all
his
scorn
of
woman
miserable
creature
he
said
hoped
that
you
would
be
reasonable
and
that
you
would
never
lower
yourself
to
the
shame
of
uttering
all
that
vileness
ah
it
is
the
eternal
struggle
of
evil
against
will
you
are
the
temptation
from
below
that
leads
men
to
base
and
final
overthrow
the
priest
has
no
worse
enemy
than
such
as
you
you
ought
to
be
driven
from
the
churches
as
impure
and
accursed
love
you
ovide
she
again
stammered
love
you
help
me
have
already
come
too
near
you
the
priest
continued
away
and
depart
from
me
you
are
satan
i
will
beat
you
if
it
be
necessary
to
force
the
evil
spirit
from
your
body
she
sank
into
a
crouching
posture
against
the
wall
silent
with
terror
at
the
priest
threatening
fist
her
hair
became
unloosened
and
a
long
white
lock
fell
over
her
brow
as
she
looked
about
the
room
for
a
refuge
she
espied
the
big
black
crucifix
and
she
still
had
strength
left
to
stretch
her
hands
towards
it
with
a
passionate
gesture
not
implore
the
cross
cried
the
priest
in
wild
anger
lived
chastely
and
it
was
that
which
enabled
him
to
die
at
that
same
moment
madame
faujas
came
into
the
room
carrying
on
her
arm
a
big
provision
basket
she
put
it
down
at
once
on
seeing
her
son
so
wrathful
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
my
child
calm
yourself
she
said
as
she
caressed
him
then
turning
upon
the
cowering
marthe
an
annihilating
glance
she
cried
you
never
leave
him
at
peace
are
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
go
downstairs
it
is
quite
impossible
for
you
to
remain
here
this
is
no
place
for
such
as
you
marthe
did
not
move
madame
faujas
had
to
lift
her
up
and
push
her
towards
the
door
the
old
woman
stormed
at
her
charging
her
with
having
waited
till
she
had
gone
out
and
making
her
promise
that
she
would
never
again
come
upstairs
to
make
such
scenes
and
finally
she
banged
the
door
violently
behind
her
marthe
went
on
reeling
down
the
stairs
she
had
ceased
sobbing
and
kept
repeating
to
herself
will
come
back
again
françois
will
turn
them
all
out
into
the
street
xxi
the
toulon
coach
which
passed
through
les
tulettes
where
it
changed
horses
left
plassans
at
three
marthe
goaded
on
by
a
fixed
unswerving
resolve
was
anxious
not
to
lose
a
moment
she
put
on
her
shawl
and
hat
and
ordered
rose
to
dress
immediately
ca
tell
what
madame
after
said
the
cook
to
olympe
i
fancy
we
going
away
for
some
days
marthe
left
the
keys
in
the
cupboard
doors
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
olympe
who
went
with
her
to
the
front
door
vainly
tried
to
ascertain
where
she
was
going
and
how
long
she
would
be
away
make
yourself
quite
easy
she
said
to
her
in
her
pleasant
way
as
they
parted
will
look
after
everything
you
will
find
things
all
right
when
you
come
back
do
hurry
yourself
take
the
time
to
do
all
you
want
if
you
go
to
marseilles
bring
us
back
some
fresh
before
marthe
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
taravelle
olympe
had
taken
possession
of
the
whole
house
when
trouche
came
home
he
found
his
wife
banging
the
doors
and
examining
the
contents
of
the
drawers
and
closets
as
she
hummed
and
sang
and
rushed
about
the
rooms
gone
off
and
taken
that
beast
of
a
cook
with
her
she
cried
to
him
as
she
lolled
into
an
luck
it
would
be
if
they
should
both
get
upset
into
a
ditch
and
stop
there
well
we
must
enjoy
ourselves
for
as
long
as
we
have
the
chance
it
very
nice
being
alone
is
it
honoré
come
and
give
me
a
kiss
we
are
quite
by
ourselves
now
and
we
can
do
just
as
we
like
marthe
and
rose
reached
the
cours
sauvaire
only
just
in
time
to
catch
the
toulon
coach
the
coupé
was
disengaged
when
the
cook
heard
her
mistress
tell
the
conductor
to
set
them
down
at
les
tulettes
she
took
her
place
with
an
expression
of
vexation
and
before
the
coach
had
got
out
of
the
town
she
had
begun
grumbling
in
her
fashion
i
did
think
that
you
were
at
last
going
to
behave
sensibly
i
felt
sure
that
we
were
going
to
marseilles
to
see
monsieur
octave
we
could
have
brought
back
a
lobster
and
some
oysters
ah
i
have
hurried
myself
so
if
i
had
known
but
it
just
like
you
you
are
always
hunting
after
troubles
and
always
doing
things
that
upset
you
marthe
was
lying
back
in
her
corner
in
a
condition
now
that
she
was
no
longer
stiffening
herself
against
the
pains
which
oppressed
her
heart
a
faintness
was
creeping
over
her
but
the
cook
did
not
even
look
towards
her
anyone
ever
hear
of
such
an
absurd
idea
as
going
to
see
the
master
she
continued
cheerful
sort
of
sight
it
will
be
for
us
we
be
able
to
sleep
for
a
week
after
it
you
may
be
as
frightened
as
you
like
at
nights
now
you
wo
get
me
to
come
and
look
under
the
furniture
for
you
it
is
as
though
your
going
to
see
him
could
do
the
master
any
good
he
just
as
likely
to
fly
at
your
face
as
not
i
hope
to
goodness
that
they
wo
let
you
see
him
it
against
the
rules
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
got
into
the
coach
when
i
heard
you
mention
les
tulettes
for
i
do
think
you
would
have
ventured
to
go
on
such
a
foolish
errand
all
by
yourself
a
deep
sigh
from
marthe
checked
her
flow
of
words
she
turned
round
to
her
mistress
saw
her
pale
and
suffocating
and
grew
still
angrier
than
before
as
she
opened
the
window
to
let
in
some
fresh
air
now
you
have
to
come
and
lie
in
my
arms
do
you
think
you
have
been
ever
so
much
better
in
bed
taking
care
of
yourself
to
think
that
you
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
surrounded
by
pious
holy
people
without
being
the
least
bit
grateful
to
god
almighty
for
it
you
know
it
only
the
truth
i
saying
his
reverence
the
curé
and
his
mother
and
sister
and
even
monsieur
trouche
himself
are
all
attention
towards
you
they
would
throw
themselves
into
the
fire
for
you
they
are
ready
to
do
anything
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
i
saw
madame
olympe
crying
yes
crying
the
last
time
you
were
and
what
sort
of
gratitude
do
you
show
them
for
all
their
kindness
and
attention
why
you
do
all
you
can
to
distress
them
and
set
off
on
the
sly
to
see
the
master
although
you
know
quite
well
that
you
will
grieve
them
dreadfully
by
doing
so
for
it
impossible
that
they
should
be
fond
of
the
master
who
treated
you
so
cruelly
i
tell
you
what
madame
marriage
has
done
you
no
good
you
got
infected
with
all
the
master
bad
nature
there
are
times
when
you
are
every
bit
as
bad
as
he
is
all
the
way
to
les
tulettes
she
continued
in
this
strain
eulogising
the
faujases
and
the
trouches
and
accusing
her
mistress
of
every
kind
of
and
she
concluded
by
saying
they
are
the
sort
of
people
who
would
make
excellent
masters
if
they
could
only
afford
to
keep
servants
but
fortune
merely
comes
in
the
way
of
folks
marthe
who
was
now
calmer
made
no
reply
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
watching
the
scraggy
trees
and
the
fields
which
spread
out
like
great
lengths
of
brown
cloth
rose
growlings
were
lost
amidst
the
noisy
jolting
of
the
coach
when
they
reached
les
tulettes
marthe
hastened
towards
the
house
of
her
uncle
macquart
followed
by
the
cook
who
had
now
subsided
into
silence
contenting
herself
by
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
biting
her
lips
is
that
you
cried
the
uncle
in
great
surprise
thought
you
were
in
your
bed
i
heard
that
you
were
very
well
my
little
dear
you
really
do
look
very
strong
have
you
come
to
ask
me
for
some
dinner
should
like
to
see
françois
uncle
said
marthe
repeated
macquart
looking
her
in
the
face
would
like
to
see
françois
it
is
a
very
kind
thought
of
yours
the
poor
fellow
has
been
crying
for
you
a
great
deal
i
have
seen
him
from
the
end
of
my
garden
knocking
his
fist
against
the
walls
while
he
called
for
you
to
come
to
him
and
so
it
is
to
see
him
that
you
have
come
eh
i
really
thought
that
you
had
forgotten
all
about
him
over
yonder
big
tears
welled
into
marthe
eyes
will
not
be
very
easy
to
see
him
macquart
continued
is
getting
on
for
four
and
i
not
at
all
sure
that
the
manager
will
give
you
leave
mouret
has
been
very
quiet
lately
he
smashes
everything
that
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
and
talks
about
burning
the
place
down
those
madmen
are
not
in
a
pleasant
humour
every
day
marthe
trembled
as
she
listened
to
her
uncle
she
was
going
to
question
him
but
instead
of
doing
so
she
merely
stretched
out
her
hands
supplicatingly
beseech
you
to
help
me
said
she
have
come
on
purpose
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
speak
to
françois
at
once
you
have
friends
in
the
asylum
and
you
can
obtain
me
admission
doubt
no
doubt
he
replied
without
committing
himself
further
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
unable
to
divine
the
real
cause
of
marthe
sudden
journey
and
revolving
the
matter
in
his
own
mind
from
a
point
of
view
known
only
to
himself
he
glanced
inquisitively
at
the
cook
who
turned
her
back
upon
him
at
last
a
slight
smile
began
to
play
about
his
lips
he
said
you
wish
it
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
only
remember
that
if
your
mother
is
displeased
about
it
you
must
tell
her
that
i
was
not
able
to
dissuade
you
i
am
afraid
that
you
may
do
yourself
harm
it
is
a
pleasant
place
to
visit
rose
absolutely
declined
to
accompany
them
to
the
asylum
she
had
seated
herself
in
front
of
a
fire
of
which
was
blazing
on
the
great
hearth
do
want
to
have
my
eyes
torn
out
she
said
snappishly
master
is
over
fond
of
me
i
would
rather
stop
here
and
warm
myself
would
be
very
good
of
you
if
you
were
to
get
us
some
mulled
wine
ready
macquart
whispered
in
her
ear
wine
and
sugar
are
in
the
cupboard
yonder
we
shall
want
it
when
we
come
back
macquart
did
not
take
his
niece
to
the
principal
gate
of
the
asylum
he
went
round
to
the
left
and
inquired
at
a
little
door
for
warder
alexandre
with
whom
on
his
appearance
he
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
then
they
all
three
silently
entered
the
seemingly
interminable
corridors
the
warder
walked
in
front
will
wait
for
you
here
said
macquart
coming
to
a
halt
in
a
little
courtyard
will
remain
with
you
would
rather
be
left
alone
said
marthe
would
very
quickly
have
enough
of
it
if
she
were
alexandre
replied
with
a
tranquil
smile
running
a
good
deal
of
risk
as
it
is
he
took
marthe
through
another
court
and
stopped
in
front
of
a
little
door
as
he
softly
turned
the
key
he
said
in
a
low
voice
be
afraid
he
has
been
quieter
and
they
have
been
able
to
take
the
off
if
he
shows
any
violence
you
must
step
out
backwards
and
leave
me
alone
with
him
marthe
trembled
as
she
passed
through
the
narrow
doorway
at
first
she
could
only
see
something
lying
in
a
heap
against
the
wall
in
one
of
the
corners
the
daylight
was
waning
and
the
cell
was
merely
lighted
by
a
pale
glimmer
which
fell
from
a
grated
window
my
fine
fellow
alexandre
exclaimed
familiarly
as
he
stepped
up
to
mouret
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
am
bringing
you
a
visitor
i
hope
you
will
behave
properly
then
he
returned
and
leant
against
the
door
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
madman
mouret
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
he
did
not
show
the
slightest
sign
of
surprise
it
you
my
dear
he
said
in
his
quiet
voice
was
expecting
you
i
was
getting
uneasy
about
the
children
marthe
knees
trembled
under
her
and
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
rendered
quite
speechless
by
his
affectionate
reception
he
did
not
appear
changed
at
all
if
anything
he
looked
better
than
he
had
done
before
he
was
sleek
and
plump
and
cleanly
shaved
his
eyes
too
were
bright
all
his
former
little
mannerisms
had
reappeared
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
winked
and
stalked
about
with
his
old
bantering
air
am
very
well
indeed
my
dear
we
can
go
back
home
together
you
have
come
for
me
have
you
i
hope
the
garden
has
been
well
looked
after
the
slugs
were
dreadfully
fond
of
the
lettuces
and
the
beds
were
quite
eaten
up
with
them
but
i
know
a
way
of
destroying
them
i
have
some
splendid
ideas
in
my
head
that
i
tell
you
of
we
are
very
comfortably
off
and
we
can
afford
to
pay
for
our
fancies
by
the
way
have
you
seen
old
gautier
of
while
i
been
absent
i
bought
thirty
hogsheads
of
common
wine
from
him
for
blending
i
must
go
and
see
him
you
never
recollect
anything
he
spoke
in
a
jesting
way
and
shook
his
finger
at
her
playfully
be
bound
that
i
shall
find
everything
in
dreadful
disorder
he
continued
never
look
after
anything
the
tools
will
be
all
lying
about
the
cupboard
doors
will
be
open
and
rose
will
be
dirtying
the
rooms
with
her
broom
why
has
rose
come
with
you
ah
what
a
strange
creature
she
is
do
you
know
she
actually
wanted
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
one
day
really
she
seems
to
think
that
the
whole
place
belongs
to
her
she
goes
on
in
the
most
amusing
way
possible
but
you
tell
me
anything
about
the
children
désirée
is
still
with
her
nurse
i
suppose
we
will
go
and
kiss
her
and
see
if
she
is
tired
of
staying
there
and
i
want
to
go
to
marseilles
as
well
for
i
am
a
little
uneasy
about
octave
the
last
time
i
was
there
i
found
him
leading
a
wild
life
as
for
serge
i
have
no
anxiety
about
him
he
is
almost
too
quiet
and
steady
he
will
sanctify
the
whole
family
ah
i
quite
enjoy
talking
about
the
house
and
the
children
he
rattled
along
at
great
length
inquiring
about
every
tree
in
his
garden
going
into
the
minutest
details
of
the
household
arrangements
and
showing
an
extraordinary
memory
of
a
host
of
insignificant
matters
marthe
was
deeply
touched
by
the
gentle
affection
which
he
manifested
for
her
she
thought
she
could
detect
a
loving
delicacy
in
the
care
which
he
took
to
say
nothing
that
savoured
of
reproach
to
make
no
allusion
however
slight
to
all
that
had
passed
she
felt
indeed
that
she
was
forgiven
and
she
vowed
that
she
would
atone
for
her
crime
by
becoming
the
submissive
servant
of
this
man
who
was
so
sublime
in
his
good
nature
big
silent
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
her
knees
bent
under
her
in
her
gratitude
care
the
warder
whispered
in
her
ear
do
like
the
look
of
his
eyes
he
is
mad
she
stammered
swear
to
you
that
he
is
mad
i
must
speak
to
the
manager
i
want
to
take
him
away
with
me
at
once
care
the
warder
repeated
sharply
pulling
her
by
her
arm
mouret
had
suddenly
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
his
chatter
and
was
now
crouching
upon
the
floor
then
all
at
once
he
began
to
crawl
along
beside
the
wall
on
his
hands
and
knees
wow
he
barked
in
hoarse
prolonged
notes
he
gave
a
spring
into
the
air
and
fell
upon
his
side
then
a
dreadful
scene
ensued
he
began
to
writhe
like
a
worm
beat
his
face
with
his
fist
and
tore
his
flesh
with
his
nails
in
a
short
time
he
was
half
naked
his
clothes
in
rags
and
himself
bruised
and
lacerated
and
groaning
away
madame
come
away
cried
the
warder
marthe
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
she
recognised
in
the
scene
before
her
her
own
writhings
at
home
it
was
in
that
way
that
she
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
floor
of
her
bedroom
it
was
in
that
way
that
she
had
beaten
and
torn
herself
she
even
recognised
the
very
tones
of
her
voice
mouret
vented
the
same
rattling
groan
it
was
she
who
had
brought
the
poor
man
into
this
miserable
state
is
not
mad
she
stammered
can
not
be
mad
it
would
be
too
horrible
i
would
rather
die
the
warder
put
his
arm
round
her
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
cell
but
she
remained
leaning
against
the
door
on
the
other
side
she
could
hear
a
terrible
struggle
going
on
within
screams
like
those
of
a
pig
being
slaughtered
then
a
dull
fall
like
that
of
a
bundle
of
damp
linen
and
afterwards
silence
when
the
warder
came
out
of
the
cell
the
night
had
nearly
fallen
through
the
partially
open
doorway
marthe
could
see
nothing
upon
my
word
madame
cried
the
warder
are
a
very
queer
person
to
say
that
he
is
not
mad
i
nearly
left
my
thumb
behind
me
he
got
firmly
hold
of
it
between
his
teeth
however
he
quieted
now
for
a
few
hours
and
as
he
took
her
back
to
her
uncle
he
continued
no
idea
how
cunning
they
all
are
they
are
as
quiet
as
can
be
for
hours
together
and
talk
to
you
in
quite
a
sensible
manner
and
then
without
the
least
warning
they
fly
at
your
throat
i
could
see
very
well
that
he
was
up
to
some
mischief
or
other
just
now
when
he
was
talking
to
you
about
the
children
for
there
was
such
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
when
marthe
got
back
to
macquart
in
the
small
courtyard
she
exclaimed
feverishly
in
a
weak
broken
voice
is
mad
he
is
mad
no
doubt
he
mad
said
her
uncle
with
a
snigger
what
did
you
expect
to
find
people
are
not
brought
here
for
nothing
and
the
place
is
healthy
either
if
i
were
to
be
shut
up
there
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
should
go
mad
myself
he
was
watching
her
askance
and
he
noted
her
nervous
start
and
shudder
then
in
his
way
he
said
you
would
like
to
go
and
see
the
grandmother
marthe
made
a
gesture
of
terror
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
would
be
no
trouble
to
anyone
he
said
would
be
glad
to
take
us
she
is
over
yonder
on
that
side
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
with
her
she
is
perfectly
quiet
she
never
gives
any
trouble
does
she
alexandre
she
always
remains
seated
and
gazing
in
front
of
her
she
has
moved
for
the
last
dozen
years
however
if
you
rather
not
see
her
we
wo
go
as
the
warder
was
taking
his
leave
of
them
macquart
invited
him
to
come
and
drink
a
glass
of
mulled
wine
winking
the
while
in
a
certain
fashion
which
seemed
to
induce
alexandre
to
accept
the
invitation
they
were
obliged
to
support
marthe
whose
legs
sank
beneath
her
at
each
step
when
they
reached
the
house
they
were
actually
carrying
her
her
face
was
convulsed
her
eyes
were
staring
widely
and
her
whole
body
was
rigidly
stiffened
by
one
of
those
nervous
seizures
which
kept
her
like
a
dead
woman
for
hours
at
a
time
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
rose
when
she
saw
them
nice
state
she
in
how
are
we
to
get
home
i
should
like
to
know
good
heavens
how
can
people
take
such
absurd
fancies
into
their
heads
the
master
ought
to
have
given
her
neck
a
twist
and
it
would
have
taught
her
a
lesson
perhaps
said
macquart
lay
her
down
on
my
bed
it
wo
kill
us
if
we
have
to
sit
up
round
the
fire
all
night
he
drew
aside
a
calico
curtain
which
hung
in
front
of
a
recess
rose
proceeded
to
undress
her
mistress
growling
as
she
did
so
the
only
thing
they
could
do
she
said
was
to
put
a
hot
brick
at
her
feet
that
she
all
snug
we
have
a
drop
to
drink
resumed
macquart
with
his
wolfish
snigger
wine
of
yours
smells
awfully
nice
old
lady
found
a
lemon
on
the
mantelpiece
rose
said
i
used
it
did
quite
right
there
is
everything
here
that
is
wanted
when
i
make
a
brew
there
nothing
missing
that
ought
to
be
in
the
place
i
assure
you
he
pulled
the
table
in
front
of
the
fire
and
then
he
sat
down
between
rose
and
alexandre
and
poured
the
hot
wine
into
some
big
yellow
cups
when
he
had
swallowed
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
with
great
gusto
he
smacked
his
lips
and
cried
that
you
understand
how
to
make
it
it
really
better
than
what
i
make
myself
you
must
leave
me
your
recipe
rose
greatly
mollified
by
these
compliments
began
to
laugh
the
fire
was
now
a
great
mass
of
glowing
embers
the
cups
were
filled
again
so
said
macquart
leaning
on
his
elbows
and
looking
rose
in
the
face
was
a
sudden
whim
of
my
niece
to
come
here
do
talk
about
it
replied
the
cook
will
make
me
angry
again
madame
is
getting
as
mad
as
the
master
she
can
no
longer
tell
who
are
her
friends
and
who
are
not
i
believe
she
had
a
quarrel
with
his
reverence
the
curé
before
she
set
off
i
heard
them
shouting
macquart
laughed
noisily
used
however
to
get
on
very
well
together
said
he
indeed
but
nothing
lasts
long
with
such
a
brain
as
madame
has
got
i
be
bound
that
she
now
regretting
the
thrashings
the
master
used
to
give
her
at
nights
we
found
his
stick
in
the
garden
macquart
looked
at
her
more
keenly
and
as
he
drank
his
hot
wine
he
said
she
came
to
take
françois
back
with
her
heaven
forbid
cried
rose
with
an
expression
of
horror
master
would
go
on
finely
in
the
house
he
would
kill
us
all
the
idea
of
his
return
is
one
of
my
greatest
dreads
i
in
a
constant
worry
lest
he
should
make
his
escape
and
get
back
some
night
and
murder
us
all
when
i
think
about
it
when
i
in
bed
i
ca
go
to
sleep
i
fancy
i
can
see
him
stealing
in
through
the
window
with
his
hair
bristling
and
his
eyes
flaming
like
matches
this
made
macquart
very
merry
and
he
rapped
his
cup
on
the
table
would
be
very
unpleasant
he
said
unpleasant
i
suppose
he
feels
very
kindly
towards
you
least
of
all
towards
the
curé
who
has
stepped
into
his
place
the
curé
would
only
make
a
mouthful
for
him
big
as
he
is
for
madmen
they
say
are
awfully
strong
i
say
alexandre
just
imagine
poor
françois
suddenly
making
his
appearance
at
home
he
would
make
a
pretty
clean
sweep
there
would
he
it
would
be
a
fine
sight
eh
he
cast
glances
at
the
warder
who
went
on
quietly
drinking
his
mulled
wine
and
made
no
reply
beyond
nodding
his
head
assentingly
it
only
a
fancy
it
all
nonsense
added
macquart
as
he
observed
rose
terrified
looks
just
at
that
moment
marthe
began
to
struggle
violently
behind
the
calico
curtain
and
she
had
to
be
held
for
some
minutes
in
order
that
she
might
not
fall
upon
the
floor
when
she
was
again
stretched
out
in
rigidity
her
uncle
came
and
warmed
his
legs
before
the
fire
reflecting
and
murmuring
as
if
without
paying
heed
to
what
he
said
little
woman
is
very
easy
to
manage
indeed
then
he
suddenly
exclaimed
rougons
now
what
do
they
say
about
all
this
business
they
take
the
curé
side
do
they
master
did
make
himself
pleasant
enough
for
them
to
regret
him
replied
rose
was
nothing
too
bad
for
him
to
say
against
them
he
was
far
wrong
there
said
macquart
rougons
are
wretched
skinflints
just
think
that
they
refused
to
buy
that
cornfield
over
yonder
a
magnificent
speculation
which
i
undertook
to
manage
félicité
would
pull
a
queer
face
if
she
saw
françois
come
back
he
began
to
snigger
again
and
took
a
turn
round
the
table
then
with
an
expression
of
determination
he
lighted
his
pipe
must
forget
the
time
my
boy
he
said
to
alexandre
with
another
wink
will
go
back
with
you
marthe
seems
quiet
now
rose
will
get
the
table
laid
by
the
time
i
return
you
must
be
hungry
rose
eh
as
you
are
obliged
to
stay
the
night
here
you
shall
have
a
mouthful
with
me
he
went
off
with
the
warder
and
fully
half
an
hour
elapsed
rose
who
began
to
tire
of
being
alone
at
last
opened
the
door
and
went
out
to
the
terrace
where
she
stood
watching
the
deserted
road
in
the
clear
night
air
as
she
was
going
back
into
the
house
she
fancied
she
could
see
two
dark
shadows
in
the
middle
of
a
path
behind
a
hedge
looks
just
like
the
uncle
thought
she
seems
to
be
talking
to
a
priest
a
few
minutes
later
macquart
returned
that
blessed
alexandre
said
he
had
been
chattering
to
him
interminably
it
you
who
were
over
there
just
now
with
a
priest
asked
rose
with
a
priest
he
cried
you
must
have
been
dreaming
there
is
a
priest
in
the
neighbourhood
he
rolled
his
little
glistening
eyes
then
as
if
rather
uneasy
about
the
lie
he
had
told
he
added
there
is
abbé
fenil
but
it
just
the
same
as
if
he
here
for
he
never
goes
out
fenil
is
up
to
much
remarked
the
cook
this
seemed
to
annoy
macquart
do
you
say
that
not
up
to
much
eh
he
does
a
great
deal
of
good
here
and
he
a
very
worthy
sort
of
fellow
he
worth
a
whole
heap
of
priests
who
make
a
lot
of
fuss
his
irritation
however
promptly
disappeared
and
he
began
to
laugh
upon
observing
that
rose
was
looking
at
him
in
surprise
was
only
joking
you
know
he
said
are
quite
right
he
like
all
the
other
priests
they
are
all
a
set
of
hypocrites
i
know
now
who
it
was
that
you
saw
me
with
i
met
our
grocer
wife
she
was
wearing
a
black
dress
and
you
must
have
mistaken
that
for
a
cassock
rose
made
an
omelet
and
macquart
placed
some
cheese
upon
the
table
they
had
not
finished
eating
when
marthe
sat
up
in
bed
with
the
astonished
look
of
a
person
awaking
in
a
strange
place
when
she
had
brushed
aside
her
hair
and
recollected
where
she
was
she
sprang
to
the
floor
and
said
she
must
be
off
at
once
macquart
appeared
very
much
vexed
at
her
awaking
quite
impossible
said
he
you
to
go
back
to
plassans
you
are
shivering
with
fever
and
you
would
fall
ill
on
the
road
rest
here
and
we
will
see
about
it
to
begin
with
there
is
no
conveyance
you
can
drive
me
in
your
trap
said
marthe
no
i
ca
marthe
who
was
dressing
with
feverish
haste
thereupon
declared
that
she
would
walk
to
plassans
rather
than
stay
the
night
at
les
tulettes
her
uncle
seemed
to
be
thinking
he
had
locked
the
door
and
slipped
the
key
into
his
pocket
he
entreated
his
niece
threatened
her
and
invented
all
kinds
of
stories
to
induce
her
to
remain
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
what
he
said
and
finished
by
putting
on
her
bonnet
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
imagine
you
can
persuade
her
to
give
in
exclaimed
rose
who
was
quietly
finishing
her
cheese
would
get
out
through
the
window
first
you
had
better
put
your
horse
to
the
trap
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
macquart
shrugging
his
shoulders
angrily
exclaimed
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
let
her
lay
herself
up
if
she
likes
i
was
only
thinking
about
her
own
good
come
along
what
will
happen
will
happen
i
drive
you
over
marthe
had
to
be
carried
to
the
gig
she
was
trembling
violently
with
fever
her
uncle
threw
an
old
cloak
over
her
shoulders
then
he
gave
a
cluck
with
his
tongue
and
set
off
no
trouble
to
me
he
said
go
over
to
plassans
this
evening
on
the
contrary
indeed
there
always
some
amusement
to
be
had
there
it
was
about
ten
in
the
sky
heavy
with
rain
clouds
there
was
a
ruddy
glimmer
that
cast
a
feeble
light
upon
the
road
all
the
way
as
they
drove
along
macquart
kept
bending
forward
and
glancing
at
the
ditches
and
the
hedges
when
rose
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
for
he
replied
that
some
wolves
had
come
down
from
the
ravines
of
la
seille
he
had
quite
recovered
his
good
humour
however
when
they
were
between
two
and
three
miles
from
plassans
the
rain
began
to
fall
it
poured
down
cold
and
pelting
then
macquart
began
to
swear
and
rose
would
have
liked
to
beat
her
mistress
who
was
moaning
underneath
the
cloak
when
at
last
they
reached
plassans
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sky
was
blue
again
you
going
to
the
rue
balande
asked
macquart
of
course
replied
rose
in
astonishment
macquart
thereupon
began
to
explain
that
as
marthe
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
ill
he
had
thought
it
might
perhaps
be
better
to
take
her
to
her
mother
after
much
hesitation
however
he
consented
to
stop
his
horse
at
the
mourets
house
marthe
had
not
even
thought
of
bringing
a
latchkey
with
her
rose
however
fortunately
had
her
own
in
her
pocket
but
when
she
tried
to
open
the
door
it
would
not
move
the
trouches
had
shot
the
bolts
inside
she
rapped
upon
it
with
her
fist
but
without
rousing
any
other
answer
than
a
dull
echo
in
the
hall
of
no
use
your
giving
yourself
any
further
trouble
said
macquart
with
a
laugh
wo
disturb
themselves
to
come
down
well
here
you
are
shut
out
of
your
own
home
do
you
think
now
that
my
first
idea
was
a
good
one
we
must
take
the
poor
child
to
the
rougons
she
will
be
better
there
than
in
her
own
room
i
assure
you
she
will
félicité
was
overwhelmed
with
alarm
when
she
saw
her
daughter
arrive
at
such
a
late
hour
drenched
with
rain
and
apparently
half
dead
she
put
her
to
bed
on
the
second
floor
set
the
house
in
great
commotion
and
called
up
all
the
servants
when
she
grew
a
little
calmer
as
she
sat
by
marthe
bedside
she
asked
for
an
explanation
has
happened
how
is
it
that
you
have
brought
her
to
me
in
such
a
state
as
this
then
macquart
with
a
great
show
of
kindness
told
her
about
dear
child
expedition
he
defended
himself
declared
that
he
had
done
all
that
he
could
to
dissuade
her
from
going
to
see
françois
and
ended
by
calling
upon
rose
to
confirm
him
for
he
saw
that
félicité
was
scanning
him
narrowly
with
her
suspicious
eyes
madame
rougon
however
continued
to
shake
her
head
is
a
very
strange
story
she
said
is
something
more
in
it
than
i
can
understand
she
knew
macquart
and
she
guessed
that
there
must
be
some
rascality
in
it
all
from
the
expression
of
delight
which
she
could
detect
in
his
eyes
are
a
strange
person
said
he
pretending
to
get
vexed
in
order
to
bring
madame
rougon
scrutiny
to
an
end
are
always
imagining
something
extraordinary
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
know
i
love
marthe
more
than
you
do
and
i
have
never
done
anything
that
was
for
her
good
shall
i
go
for
the
doctor
i
will
at
once
if
you
like
madame
rougon
watched
him
closely
she
even
questioned
rose
at
great
length
without
succeeding
however
in
learning
anything
further
after
all
she
seemed
glad
to
have
her
daughter
with
her
and
spoke
with
great
bitterness
of
people
who
would
leave
you
to
die
on
your
own
doorstep
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
open
the
door
and
meantime
marthe
with
her
head
thrown
back
upon
her
pillow
was
indeed
dying
xxii
it
was
perfectly
dark
in
the
cell
at
les
tulettes
a
draught
of
cold
air
awoke
mouret
from
the
cataleptic
stupor
into
which
his
violence
earlier
in
the
evening
had
thrown
him
he
remained
lying
against
the
wall
in
perfect
stillness
for
a
few
moments
his
eyes
staring
widely
then
he
began
to
roll
his
head
gently
on
the
cold
stone
wailing
like
a
child
just
awakened
from
sleep
but
the
current
of
chill
damp
air
swept
against
his
legs
and
he
rose
and
looked
around
him
to
see
whence
it
came
in
front
of
him
he
saw
the
door
of
his
cell
wide
open
has
left
the
door
open
said
he
aloud
will
be
expecting
me
i
must
be
off
he
went
out
and
then
came
back
and
felt
his
clothes
after
the
manner
of
a
methodical
man
who
is
afraid
of
forgetting
something
and
finally
he
carefully
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
passed
through
the
first
court
with
an
easy
unconcerned
gait
as
though
he
were
merely
taking
a
stroll
as
he
was
entering
the
second
one
he
caught
sight
of
a
warder
who
seemed
to
be
on
the
watch
he
stopped
and
deliberated
for
a
moment
but
the
warder
having
disappeared
he
crossed
the
court
and
reached
another
door
which
led
to
the
open
country
he
closed
it
behind
him
without
any
appearance
of
astonishment
or
haste
is
a
good
woman
all
the
same
he
murmured
must
have
heard
me
calling
her
it
must
be
getting
late
i
will
go
home
at
once
for
fear
they
should
feel
uneasy
he
struck
out
along
a
path
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
him
to
find
himself
among
the
open
fields
when
he
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
he
had
altogether
forgotten
that
les
tulettes
was
behind
him
and
imagined
that
he
had
just
left
a
from
whom
he
had
purchased
fifty
hogsheads
of
wine
when
he
reached
a
spot
where
five
roads
met
he
recognised
where
he
was
and
began
to
laugh
as
he
said
to
himself
a
goose
i
am
i
was
going
up
the
hill
towards
it
is
to
the
left
i
must
turn
i
shall
be
at
plassans
in
a
good
hour
and
a
half
then
he
went
merrily
along
the
looking
at
each
of
the
as
at
an
old
acquaintance
he
stopped
for
a
moment
before
certain
fields
and
with
an
air
of
interest
the
sky
was
of
an
ashy
hue
streaked
with
broad
rosy
bands
that
lighted
up
the
night
like
dying
embers
heavy
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
east
and
was
full
of
moisture
said
mouret
looking
up
at
the
sky
uneasily
must
stop
loitering
the
wind
is
in
the
east
and
there
going
to
be
a
pretty
downpour
i
shall
never
be
able
to
reach
plassans
before
it
begins
and
i
not
well
wrapped
up
either
he
gathered
round
his
breast
the
thick
grey
woollen
waistcoat
which
he
had
torn
at
les
tulettes
he
had
a
bad
bruise
on
his
jaw
to
which
he
raised
his
hand
without
heeding
the
sharp
pain
which
it
caused
him
the
was
quite
deserted
and
he
only
met
a
cart
going
down
a
hill
at
a
leisurely
pace
the
driver
was
dozing
and
made
no
response
to
his
friendly
the
rain
did
not
overtake
him
till
he
reached
the
bridge
across
the
viorne
it
distressed
him
very
much
and
he
went
to
take
shelter
under
the
bridge
grumbling
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
go
on
through
such
weather
that
nothing
ruined
clothes
so
much
as
rain
and
that
if
he
had
known
what
was
coming
he
would
have
brought
an
umbrella
he
waited
patiently
for
a
long
amusing
himself
by
listening
to
the
streaming
of
the
downpour
then
when
it
was
over
he
returned
to
the
and
at
last
reached
plassans
ever
taking
the
greatest
care
to
keep
himself
from
getting
splashed
with
mud
it
was
nearly
midnight
though
mouret
calculated
that
it
could
scarcely
yet
be
eight
he
passed
through
the
deserted
streets
feeling
quite
distressed
that
he
had
kept
his
wife
waiting
such
a
long
time
wo
be
able
to
understand
it
he
thought
dinner
will
be
quite
cold
ah
i
shall
get
a
nice
reception
from
rose
at
last
he
reached
the
rue
balande
and
stood
before
his
own
door
he
said
have
not
got
my
latchkey
he
did
not
knock
at
the
door
however
the
kitchen
window
was
quite
dark
and
the
other
windows
in
the
front
were
equally
void
of
all
sign
of
life
a
sense
of
deep
suspicion
then
took
possession
of
the
madman
with
an
instinct
that
was
quite
he
scented
danger
he
stepped
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
neighbouring
houses
and
again
examined
the
then
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
and
went
round
into
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
but
the
little
door
that
led
into
the
garden
was
bolted
at
this
impelled
by
sudden
rage
he
threw
himself
against
it
with
tremendous
force
and
the
door
rotted
by
damp
broke
into
two
pieces
for
a
moment
the
violence
of
the
shock
almost
stunned
mouret
and
rendered
him
unconscious
of
why
he
had
broken
down
the
door
which
he
tried
to
mend
again
by
joining
the
broken
pieces
a
nice
thing
to
have
done
when
i
might
so
easily
have
knocked
he
said
with
a
sudden
pang
of
regret
will
cost
me
at
least
thirty
francs
to
get
a
new
door
he
was
now
in
the
garden
as
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
the
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
brightly
lighted
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
wife
was
going
to
bed
this
caused
him
great
astonishment
and
he
muttered
that
he
must
certainly
have
dropped
off
to
sleep
under
the
bridge
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
rain
to
stop
it
must
be
very
late
he
thought
the
windows
of
the
neighbouring
houses
monsieur
as
well
as
those
of
the
were
in
darkness
then
he
again
fixed
his
eyes
upon
his
own
house
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
glow
of
a
lamp
on
the
second
floor
behind
abbé
faujas
thick
curtains
that
glow
was
like
a
flaming
eye
and
seemed
to
scorch
him
he
pressed
his
brow
with
his
burning
hands
and
his
head
grew
dizzy
racked
by
some
horrible
recollection
like
a
vague
nightmare
in
which
nothing
was
clearly
defined
but
which
seemed
to
apply
to
some
danger
to
himself
and
his
family
a
danger
which
grew
and
increased
in
horror
and
threatened
to
swallow
up
the
house
unless
he
could
do
something
to
save
it
marthe
where
are
you
he
stammered
in
an
undertone
and
bring
away
the
children
he
looked
about
him
for
marthe
he
could
no
longer
recognise
the
garden
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
larger
to
be
empty
and
grey
and
like
a
cemetery
the
big
had
vanished
the
lettuces
were
no
longer
there
the
had
disappeared
he
turned
round
again
came
back
and
knelt
down
to
see
if
the
slugs
had
eaten
everything
up
the
disappearance
of
the
the
death
of
their
lofty
greenery
caused
him
an
especial
pang
as
though
some
of
the
actual
life
of
the
house
had
departed
who
was
it
that
had
killed
them
what
villain
had
been
there
uprooting
everything
and
tearing
away
even
the
tufts
of
violets
which
he
had
planted
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
indignation
arose
in
him
as
he
contemplated
all
this
ruin
marthe
where
are
you
he
called
again
he
looked
for
her
in
the
little
conservatory
to
the
right
of
the
terrace
it
was
littered
with
the
dead
dry
corpses
of
the
they
were
piled
up
in
bundles
amidst
the
stumps
of
the
in
one
corner
was
désirée
hanging
from
a
nail
with
the
door
broken
off
and
the
sadly
torn
the
madman
stepped
back
overwhelmed
with
fear
as
though
he
had
opened
the
door
of
a
vault
stammering
his
throat
on
fire
he
went
back
to
the
terrace
and
paced
up
and
down
before
the
door
and
the
shuttered
windows
his
increasing
rage
gave
his
limbs
the
suppleness
of
a
wild
beast
he
braced
himself
up
and
stepped
along
noiselessly
trying
to
find
some
opening
an
into
the
cellar
was
sufficient
for
him
he
squeezed
himself
together
and
glided
inside
with
the
nimbleness
of
a
cat
scraping
the
wall
with
his
nails
as
he
went
at
last
he
was
in
the
house
the
cellar
door
was
only
latched
he
made
his
way
through
the
darkness
of
the
hall
groping
past
the
walls
with
his
hands
and
pushing
the
kitchen
door
open
some
matches
were
on
a
shelf
at
the
left
he
went
straight
to
this
shelf
and
struck
a
light
to
enable
him
to
get
a
lamp
which
stood
upon
the
mantelpiece
without
breaking
anything
then
he
looked
about
him
there
appeared
to
have
been
a
big
meal
there
that
evening
the
kitchen
was
in
a
state
of
festive
disorder
the
table
was
strewn
with
dirty
plates
and
dishes
and
glasses
there
was
a
litter
of
pans
still
warm
on
the
sink
and
the
chairs
and
the
very
floor
a
that
had
been
forgotten
was
also
boiling
away
beside
the
stove
slightly
tilted
like
a
tipsy
man
mouret
put
it
straight
and
then
tidily
arranged
the
pans
he
smelt
them
sniffed
at
the
drops
of
liquor
that
remained
in
the
glasses
and
counted
the
dishes
and
plates
with
growing
irritation
this
was
no
longer
his
quiet
orderly
kitchen
it
seemed
as
if
a
hotelful
of
food
had
been
wasted
there
all
this
guzzling
disorder
reeked
of
indigestion
marthe
he
again
repeated
as
he
returned
into
the
passage
carrying
the
lamp
as
he
went
me
tell
me
where
they
have
shut
you
up
we
must
be
off
we
must
be
off
at
once
he
searched
for
her
in
the
the
two
cupboards
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
stove
were
open
from
a
burst
bag
of
grey
paper
on
the
edge
of
a
shelf
some
lumps
of
sugar
had
fallen
upon
the
floor
higher
up
mouret
could
see
a
bottle
of
brandy
with
the
neck
broken
and
plugged
with
a
piece
of
rag
then
he
got
upon
a
chair
to
examine
the
cupboards
they
were
half
empty
the
jars
of
preserved
fruits
had
been
attacked
the
had
been
opened
and
the
jam
tasted
the
fruit
had
been
nibbled
the
provisions
of
all
kinds
had
been
gnawed
and
fouled
as
though
a
whole
army
of
rats
had
been
there
not
being
able
to
find
marthe
in
the
closets
mouret
searched
all
over
the
room
looking
behind
the
curtains
and
even
underneath
the
furniture
fragments
of
bone
and
pieces
of
broken
bread
lay
about
the
floor
there
were
marks
on
the
table
that
had
been
left
by
sticky
glasses
then
he
crossed
the
hall
and
went
to
look
for
marthe
in
the
but
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
he
stopped
short
this
could
not
really
be
his
own
the
bright
mauve
paper
the
carpet
the
new
covered
with
cerise
damask
filled
him
with
amazement
he
was
afraid
to
enter
a
room
that
did
not
belong
to
him
and
he
closed
the
door
marthe
he
stammered
again
in
accents
of
despair
he
went
back
to
the
middle
of
the
hall
unable
to
quiet
the
hoarse
panting
which
was
swelling
in
his
throat
where
had
he
got
to
that
he
could
not
recognise
a
single
spot
who
had
been
transforming
his
house
in
such
a
way
his
recollections
were
quite
confused
he
could
only
recall
some
shadows
gliding
along
the
hall
two
shadows
at
first
then
tipsy
and
two
shadows
that
leered
and
sniggered
he
raised
his
lamp
the
wick
of
which
was
burning
smokily
and
thereupon
the
shadows
grew
bigger
lengthened
upon
the
walls
mounted
aloft
beside
the
staircase
and
filled
and
preyed
upon
the
whole
house
some
horrid
filth
some
fermenting
putrescence
had
found
its
way
into
the
place
and
had
rotted
the
woodwork
rusted
the
iron
and
split
the
walls
then
he
seemed
to
hear
the
house
crumbling
like
a
ceiling
from
dampness
and
to
see
it
melting
like
a
handful
of
salt
thrown
into
a
basin
of
hot
water
but
up
above
there
sounded
peals
of
ringing
laughter
which
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
he
put
the
lamp
down
and
went
upstairs
to
look
for
marthe
he
crept
up
noiselessly
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
all
the
nimbleness
and
stealth
of
a
wolf
when
he
reached
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
he
knelt
down
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
bedroom
a
ray
of
light
streamed
from
underneath
it
marthe
must
be
going
to
bed
a
jolly
bed
this
is
of
theirs
olympe
was
just
exclaiming
can
quite
bury
yourself
in
it
honoré
i
am
right
up
to
my
eyes
in
feathers
she
laughed
and
stretched
herself
and
sprang
about
amidst
the
since
i
been
here
she
continued
been
longing
to
sleep
in
this
bed
it
made
me
almost
ill
wishing
for
it
i
could
never
see
that
lath
of
a
landlady
of
ours
get
into
it
without
feeling
a
furious
desire
to
throw
her
on
to
the
floor
and
put
myself
in
her
place
one
gets
quite
warm
directly
it
just
as
though
i
were
wrapped
in
trouche
who
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
was
examining
the
bottles
on
the
has
got
all
kinds
of
scents
he
said
as
she
is
here
we
may
just
as
well
treat
ourselves
to
the
best
room
continued
olympe
no
danger
of
her
coming
back
and
disturbing
us
i
have
fastened
the
doors
up
you
will
be
getting
cold
honoré
but
trouche
now
opened
the
drawers
and
began
groping
about
amongst
the
linen
this
on
it
smothered
with
lace
he
said
tossing
a
to
olympe
shall
wear
this
red
handkerchief
myself
then
as
trouche
was
at
last
getting
into
bed
olympe
said
to
him
the
grog
on
the
we
need
not
get
up
and
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
for
it
there
my
dear
we
are
like
real
householders
now
they
lay
down
side
by
side
with
the
quilt
drawn
up
to
their
chins
ate
a
deuced
lot
this
evening
said
trouche
after
a
short
pause
drank
a
lot
too
added
olympe
with
a
laugh
feel
very
cosy
and
snug
but
the
tiresome
part
is
that
my
mother
is
always
interfering
with
us
she
has
been
quite
awful
i
ca
take
a
single
step
about
the
house
without
her
being
at
me
there
really
no
advantage
in
our
landlady
going
off
if
mother
means
to
play
the
policeman
she
has
quite
spoilt
my
day
enjoyment
the
abbé
some
idea
of
going
away
asked
trouche
after
another
short
interval
of
silence
he
is
made
a
bishop
he
will
be
obliged
to
leave
the
house
to
us
ca
be
sure
of
that
olympe
petulantly
replied
dare
say
mother
means
to
keep
it
but
how
jolly
we
should
be
here
all
by
ourselves
i
would
make
our
landlady
sleep
upstairs
in
my
room
i
persuade
her
that
it
was
healthier
than
this
pass
me
the
glass
honoré
they
both
took
a
drink
and
then
covered
themselves
up
afresh
said
trouche
afraid
it
wo
be
so
easy
to
get
rid
of
them
but
we
can
try
at
any
rate
i
believe
the
abbé
would
have
changed
his
quarters
before
if
he
had
not
been
afraid
that
the
landlady
would
have
considered
herself
deserted
and
have
made
a
rumpus
i
think
i
try
to
talk
the
landlady
over
i
tell
her
a
lot
of
tales
to
persuade
her
to
turn
them
out
he
took
another
drink
leave
the
matter
to
me
replied
olympe
get
mother
and
ovide
turned
out
as
they
treated
us
so
badly
if
you
do
succeed
said
trouche
can
easily
concoct
some
scandal
about
the
abbé
and
madame
mouret
and
then
he
will
be
absolutely
obliged
to
shift
his
quarters
olympe
sat
up
in
bed
a
splendid
idea
she
said
is
we
must
set
about
it
before
a
month
is
over
this
room
will
be
ours
i
must
really
give
you
a
kiss
for
the
idea
they
then
both
grew
very
merry
and
began
to
plan
how
they
would
arrange
the
room
they
would
change
the
place
of
the
chest
of
drawers
they
said
and
they
would
bring
up
a
couple
of
from
the
however
their
speech
was
gradually
growing
huskier
and
at
last
they
became
silent
you
off
now
murmured
olympe
after
a
time
snoring
with
your
eyes
open
well
let
me
come
to
the
other
side
so
that
at
any
rate
i
can
finish
my
novel
i
not
sleepy
if
you
are
she
got
up
and
rolled
him
like
a
mere
lump
towards
the
wall
and
then
began
to
read
but
before
she
had
finished
a
page
she
turned
her
head
uneasily
towards
the
door
she
fancied
she
could
hear
a
strange
noise
on
the
landing
at
this
she
cried
petulantly
to
her
husband
giving
him
a
dig
in
the
ribs
with
her
elbow
know
very
well
that
i
do
like
that
sort
of
joke
do
play
the
wolf
anyone
would
fancy
that
there
was
somebody
at
the
door
well
go
on
if
it
pleases
you
you
are
very
irritating
then
she
angrily
absorbed
herself
in
her
book
again
after
sucking
a
slice
of
lemon
left
in
her
glass
with
the
same
stealthy
movements
as
before
mouret
now
quitted
the
door
of
the
bedroom
where
he
had
remained
crouching
he
climbed
to
the
second
floor
and
knelt
before
abbé
faujas
door
squeezing
himself
close
to
the
he
choked
down
marthe
name
that
again
rose
in
his
throat
and
examined
with
glistening
eye
the
corners
of
the
priest
room
to
satisfy
himself
that
nobody
was
shut
up
there
the
big
bare
room
was
in
deep
shadow
a
small
lamp
which
stood
upon
the
table
cast
just
a
circular
patch
of
light
upon
the
floor
and
the
abbé
himself
who
was
writing
seemed
like
a
big
black
stain
in
the
midst
of
that
yellow
glare
after
he
had
scrutinised
the
curtains
and
the
chest
of
drawers
mouret
gaze
fell
upon
the
iron
bedstead
upon
which
lay
the
priest
hat
looking
like
the
locks
of
a
woman
hair
there
was
no
doubt
that
marthe
was
there
thought
mouret
had
the
trouches
said
that
she
was
to
have
that
room
but
as
he
continued
gazing
he
saw
that
the
bed
was
undisturbed
and
looked
with
its
cold
white
coverings
like
a
tombstone
his
eyes
were
getting
accustomed
to
the
gloom
however
abbé
faujas
appeared
to
hear
some
sound
for
he
glanced
at
the
door
when
the
maniac
saw
the
priest
calm
face
his
eyes
reddened
a
slight
foam
appeared
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
suppressed
a
shout
at
last
he
went
away
on
his
hands
and
knees
again
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
still
repeating
in
low
tones
marthe
he
searched
for
her
through
the
whole
house
in
rose
room
which
he
found
empty
in
the
trouches
apartments
which
were
filled
with
the
spoils
of
the
other
rooms
in
the
children
old
rooms
where
he
burst
into
tears
as
his
hands
came
across
a
pair
of
boots
which
had
belonged
to
désirée
he
went
up
and
down
the
stairs
clinging
on
to
the
banisters
and
gliding
along
the
walls
stealthily
exploring
every
apartment
with
the
extraordinary
dexterity
of
a
scheming
maniac
soon
there
was
not
a
single
corner
of
the
place
from
the
cellar
to
the
attic
which
he
had
not
investigated
marthe
was
nowhere
in
the
house
nor
were
the
children
there
nor
rose
the
house
was
empty
the
house
might
crumble
to
pieces
mouret
sat
down
upon
the
stairs
he
choked
down
the
panting
which
in
spite
of
himself
continued
to
distend
his
throat
with
his
back
against
the
banisters
and
his
eyes
wide
open
in
the
darkness
he
sat
waiting
absorbed
in
a
scheme
which
he
was
patiently
thinking
out
his
senses
became
so
acute
that
he
could
hear
the
slightest
sounds
that
arose
in
the
house
down
below
him
snored
trouche
while
olympe
turned
over
the
pages
of
her
book
with
a
slight
rubbing
of
her
fingers
against
the
paper
on
the
second
floor
abbé
faujas
pen
made
a
scratching
sound
like
the
crawling
of
an
insect
while
in
the
adjoining
room
madame
faujas
heavy
breathing
seemed
like
an
accompaniment
to
that
shrill
music
mouret
sat
for
an
hour
with
his
ears
sharply
strained
olympe
was
the
first
of
the
wakeful
ones
to
succumb
to
sleep
he
could
hear
her
novel
fall
upon
the
floor
then
abbé
faujas
laid
down
his
pen
and
undressed
himself
quietly
gliding
about
his
room
in
his
slippers
he
slipped
off
his
clothes
in
silence
and
did
not
even
make
the
bed
creak
as
he
got
into
it
ah
the
house
had
gone
to
rest
at
last
but
the
madman
could
tell
from
the
sound
of
the
abbé
breathing
that
he
was
yet
awake
gradually
that
breathing
grew
fuller
and
at
last
the
whole
house
slept
mouret
waited
on
for
another
he
still
listened
with
strained
ears
as
though
he
could
hear
the
four
sleepers
descending
into
deeper
and
deeper
slumber
the
house
lay
wrapped
in
darkness
and
unconsciousness
then
the
maniac
rose
up
and
slowly
made
his
way
into
the
passage
is
here
any
longer
the
house
is
here
nothing
is
here
he
murmured
he
opened
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
and
went
down
to
the
little
conservatory
when
he
got
there
he
methodically
removed
the
big
dry
and
carried
them
upstairs
in
enormous
armfuls
piling
them
in
front
of
the
doors
of
the
trouches
and
the
faujases
he
felt
too
a
craving
for
a
bright
light
and
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
lighted
all
the
lamps
which
he
placed
upon
the
tables
in
the
various
rooms
and
on
the
landings
and
along
the
passages
then
he
brought
up
the
rest
of
the
they
were
soon
piled
higher
than
the
doors
as
he
was
making
his
last
journey
with
them
he
raised
his
eyes
and
noticed
the
windows
next
he
went
out
into
the
garden
again
took
the
trunks
of
the
and
stacked
them
up
under
the
windows
skilfully
arranging
for
little
currents
of
air
which
should
make
them
blaze
freely
the
stack
seemed
to
him
but
a
small
one
however
is
nothing
left
he
murmured
must
be
nothing
left
then
as
a
thought
struck
him
he
went
down
into
the
cellar
and
recommenced
his
journeying
backwards
and
forwards
he
was
now
carrying
up
the
supply
of
fuel
for
the
winter
the
coal
the
and
the
wood
the
pile
under
the
windows
gradually
grew
bigger
as
he
carefully
arranged
each
bundle
of
he
was
thrilled
with
livelier
satisfaction
he
next
proceeded
to
distribute
the
fuel
through
the
rooms
on
the
and
left
a
heap
of
it
in
the
and
another
heap
in
the
kitchen
then
he
piled
the
furniture
atop
of
the
different
heaps
an
hour
sufficed
him
to
get
his
work
finished
he
had
taken
his
boots
off
and
had
glided
about
all
over
the
house
with
heavily
laden
arms
so
dexterously
that
he
had
not
let
a
single
piece
of
wood
fall
roughly
to
the
floor
he
seemed
endowed
with
new
life
with
extraordinary
nimbleness
of
motion
as
far
as
this
one
firmly
fixed
idea
of
his
went
he
was
perfectly
in
possession
of
his
senses
when
all
was
ready
he
lingered
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
his
work
he
went
from
pile
to
pile
took
pleasure
in
viewing
the
pyres
and
gently
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
an
appearance
of
extreme
satisfaction
as
a
few
fragments
of
coal
had
fallen
on
the
stairs
he
ran
off
to
get
a
brush
and
carefully
swept
the
black
dust
from
the
steps
then
he
completed
his
inspection
with
the
careful
precision
of
a
man
who
means
to
do
things
as
they
ought
to
be
done
he
gradually
became
quite
excited
with
satisfaction
and
dropped
on
to
his
hands
and
knees
again
and
began
to
hop
about
panting
more
heavily
in
his
savage
joy
at
last
he
took
a
and
set
fire
to
the
heaps
first
of
all
he
lighted
the
pile
on
the
terrace
underneath
the
windows
then
he
leapt
back
into
the
house
and
set
fire
to
the
heaps
in
the
and
and
then
to
those
in
the
kitchen
and
the
hall
next
he
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
flung
the
remains
of
his
blazing
brand
upon
the
piles
that
lay
against
the
doors
of
the
trouches
and
faujases
an
rage
was
thrilling
him
and
the
lurid
blaze
of
the
fire
brought
his
madness
to
a
climax
he
twice
came
down
the
stairs
with
terrific
leaps
bounded
about
through
the
thick
smoke
fanning
the
flames
with
his
breath
and
casting
handfuls
of
coal
upon
them
at
the
sight
of
the
flames
already
mounting
to
the
ceilings
of
the
rooms
he
sat
down
every
now
and
then
and
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
with
all
his
strength
the
house
was
now
roaring
like
an
stove
the
flames
burst
out
at
all
points
at
once
with
a
violence
that
split
the
floors
but
the
maniac
made
his
way
upstairs
again
through
the
sheets
of
fire
singeing
his
hair
and
blackening
his
clothes
as
he
went
and
he
posted
himself
on
the
crouching
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
his
growling
head
thrown
forward
he
was
keeping
guard
over
the
landing
and
his
eyes
never
quitted
the
priest
door
ovide
shrieked
a
voice
madame
faujas
door
at
the
end
of
the
landing
was
suddenly
opened
and
the
flames
swept
into
her
room
with
the
roar
of
a
tempest
the
old
woman
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
stretching
out
her
arms
she
hurled
aside
the
blazing
brands
and
sprang
on
to
the
landing
pulling
and
pushing
away
with
her
hands
and
feet
the
burning
heap
that
blocked
up
her
son
door
and
calling
all
the
while
to
the
priest
despairingly
the
maniac
crouched
still
lower
down
his
eyes
gleaming
while
he
continued
to
growl
for
me
do
get
out
of
the
window
cried
madame
faujas
striking
at
her
son
door
she
threw
her
weight
against
it
and
the
charred
door
yielded
easily
she
reappeared
holding
her
son
in
her
arms
he
had
taken
time
to
put
on
his
cassock
and
was
choking
half
suffocated
by
the
smoke
am
going
to
carry
you
ovide
she
cried
with
energetic
determination
well
on
to
my
shoulders
and
clutch
hold
of
my
hair
if
you
feel
you
are
slipping
do
trouble
i
carry
you
through
it
all
she
hoisted
him
upon
her
shoulders
as
though
he
were
a
child
and
this
sublime
mother
this
old
peasant
woman
carrying
her
devotion
to
death
itself
did
not
so
much
as
totter
beneath
the
crushing
weight
of
that
big
swooning
unresisting
body
she
extinguished
the
burning
brands
with
her
naked
feet
and
made
a
free
passage
through
the
flames
by
brushing
them
aside
with
her
open
hand
so
that
her
son
might
not
even
be
touched
by
them
but
just
as
she
was
about
to
go
downstairs
the
maniac
whom
she
had
not
observed
sprang
upon
the
abbé
faujas
and
tore
him
from
off
her
shoulders
his
muttered
growl
turned
into
a
wild
shriek
while
he
writhed
in
a
fit
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
belaboured
the
priest
tore
him
with
his
nails
and
strangled
him
marthe
he
bellowed
then
he
rolled
down
the
blazing
stairs
still
with
the
priest
in
his
grasp
while
madame
faujas
who
had
driven
her
teeth
into
his
throat
drained
his
blood
the
trouches
perished
in
their
drunken
stupor
without
a
groan
and
the
house
gutted
and
undermined
collapsed
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
sparks
xxiii
macquart
did
not
find
porquier
at
home
and
so
the
doctor
only
reached
madame
rougon
at
nearly
twelve
the
whole
house
was
still
in
commotion
rougon
himself
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
got
out
of
bed
emotion
had
a
killing
effect
upon
him
said
he
félicité
who
was
still
seated
in
the
same
armchair
by
marthe
bedside
rose
to
meet
the
doctor
my
dear
doctor
we
are
so
very
anxious
she
murmured
poor
child
has
never
stirred
since
we
put
her
to
bed
there
her
hands
are
already
quite
cold
i
have
kept
them
in
my
own
but
it
has
done
no
good
doctor
porquier
scanned
marthe
face
and
then
without
making
any
further
examination
he
compressed
his
lips
and
made
a
vague
gesture
with
his
hands
dear
madame
rougon
he
said
must
summon
up
your
courage
félicité
burst
into
sobs
end
is
at
hand
the
doctor
continued
in
a
lower
voice
have
been
expecting
this
sad
termination
for
a
long
time
past
i
must
confess
so
much
now
both
of
poor
madame
mouret
lungs
are
diseased
and
in
her
case
phthisis
has
been
complicated
by
nervous
derangement
he
took
a
seat
and
a
smile
played
about
his
lips
the
smile
of
the
polished
doctor
who
thinks
that
even
in
the
presence
of
death
itself
suave
politeness
is
demanded
of
him
give
way
and
make
yourself
ill
my
dear
lady
the
catastrophe
was
inevitable
and
any
little
accident
might
have
hastened
it
i
should
imagine
that
poor
madame
mouret
must
have
been
subject
to
coughing
when
she
was
very
young
was
she
i
should
say
that
the
germs
of
the
disease
have
been
spreading
within
her
for
a
good
many
years
past
latterly
and
especially
within
the
last
three
years
phthisis
has
been
making
frightful
strides
in
her
how
pious
and
devotional
she
was
i
have
been
quite
touched
to
see
her
passing
away
in
such
sanctity
well
well
the
decrees
of
providence
are
inscrutable
science
is
very
often
quite
powerless
seeing
that
madame
rougon
still
continued
to
weep
he
poured
out
upon
her
the
tenderest
consolations
and
pressed
her
to
take
a
cup
of
water
to
calm
herself
distress
yourself
i
beg
you
he
continued
assure
you
that
she
has
lost
all
sense
of
pain
she
will
continue
sleeping
as
tranquilly
as
she
is
doing
at
present
and
will
only
regain
consciousness
just
before
death
i
wo
leave
you
i
will
remain
here
though
my
services
are
quite
unavailing
i
shall
stay
however
as
a
friend
my
dear
lady
as
a
friend
he
settled
himself
comfortably
for
the
night
in
an
easy
chair
félicité
grew
a
little
calmer
when
doctor
porquier
gave
her
to
understand
that
marthe
had
only
a
few
more
hours
to
live
she
thought
of
sending
for
serge
from
the
seminary
which
was
near
at
hand
she
asked
rose
to
go
there
for
him
but
the
cook
at
first
refused
you
want
to
kill
the
poor
little
fellow
as
well
she
exclaimed
would
be
too
great
a
shock
for
him
to
be
called
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
come
to
see
a
dead
woman
i
wo
be
his
murderer
rose
still
retained
bitter
feelings
against
her
mistress
ever
since
the
latter
had
been
lying
there
dying
she
had
paced
round
the
bed
angrily
knocking
about
the
cups
and
the
bottles
there
any
sense
in
doing
such
a
thing
as
madame
did
she
cried
has
only
herself
to
blame
if
she
has
got
her
death
by
going
to
see
the
master
and
now
everything
is
turned
and
we
are
all
distracted
no
no
i
do
approve
at
all
of
the
little
fellow
being
startled
out
of
his
sleep
in
such
a
way
in
the
end
however
she
consented
to
go
to
the
seminary
doctor
porquier
had
stretched
himself
out
in
front
of
the
fire
and
with
eyes
continued
to
address
consolatory
words
to
madame
rougon
a
slight
rattling
sound
began
to
be
heard
in
marthe
chest
uncle
macquart
who
had
not
appeared
again
since
he
had
gone
away
two
good
hours
previously
now
gently
pushed
the
door
open
have
you
been
félicité
asked
him
taking
him
into
a
corner
of
the
room
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
to
put
his
horse
and
trap
up
at
the
three
pigeons
but
his
eyes
sparkled
so
vividly
and
there
was
such
a
look
of
diabolical
cunning
about
him
that
she
was
filled
with
a
thousand
suspicions
she
forgot
her
dying
daughter
for
the
moment
for
she
scented
some
trickery
which
it
was
imperative
for
her
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
would
imagine
that
you
had
been
following
and
playing
the
spy
upon
somebody
she
said
looking
at
his
muddy
trousers
are
hiding
something
from
me
macquart
it
is
not
right
of
you
we
have
always
treated
you
very
well
very
well
indeed
sniggered
macquart
glad
you
told
me
so
rougon
is
a
skinflint
he
treated
me
like
the
lowest
of
the
low
in
the
matter
of
that
cornfield
where
is
rougon
snoozing
comfortably
in
his
bed
eh
it
little
he
cares
for
all
the
trouble
one
takes
about
the
family
the
smile
which
accompanied
these
last
words
greatly
disquieted
félicité
she
looked
him
keenly
in
the
face
trouble
have
you
taken
for
the
family
she
asked
you
grudge
having
brought
poor
marthe
back
from
les
tulettes
i
tell
you
again
that
all
that
business
has
a
very
suspicious
look
i
have
been
questioning
rose
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
wanted
to
come
straight
here
it
surprises
me
that
you
did
not
knock
more
loudly
in
the
rue
balande
they
would
have
come
and
opened
the
door
i
not
saying
this
because
i
do
want
my
dear
child
to
be
here
i
am
glad
to
think
on
the
contrary
that
she
will
at
any
rate
die
among
her
own
people
and
will
have
only
loving
faces
about
her
macquart
seemed
greatly
surprised
at
this
speech
and
interrupted
her
by
saying
with
an
uneasy
manner
thought
that
you
and
abbé
faujas
were
the
best
of
friends
she
made
no
reply
but
stepped
up
to
marthe
whose
breathing
was
now
becoming
more
difficult
when
she
left
the
bedside
again
she
saw
macquart
pulling
one
of
the
curtains
aside
and
peering
out
into
the
dark
night
while
rubbing
the
moist
with
his
hand
go
away
without
coming
and
talking
to
me
she
said
to
him
want
to
have
all
this
cleared
up
as
you
like
he
replied
are
very
difficult
to
please
first
you
like
people
and
then
you
do
like
them
i
always
keep
on
in
the
same
regular
way
he
was
evidently
very
much
vexed
to
find
that
the
rougons
no
longer
made
common
cause
with
abbé
faujas
he
tapped
the
window
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
still
kept
his
eyes
on
the
black
night
just
at
that
moment
the
sky
was
reddened
by
a
sudden
glow
is
that
asked
félicité
macquart
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
looks
like
a
fire
he
said
unconcernedly
is
something
burning
behind
the
there
were
sounds
of
commotion
on
the
place
a
servant
came
into
the
room
with
a
scared
look
and
told
them
that
the
house
of
daughter
was
on
fire
it
was
believed
he
continued
that
he
whom
they
had
been
obliged
to
shut
up
had
been
seen
walking
about
the
garden
carrying
a
burning
the
most
unfortunate
part
of
the
matter
was
that
there
seemed
no
hope
of
saving
the
lodgers
félicité
turned
sharply
round
and
pondered
for
a
minute
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
macquart
then
she
clearly
understood
everything
promised
me
solemnly
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
would
conduct
yourself
quietly
and
decently
when
we
set
you
up
in
your
little
house
at
les
tulettes
you
have
everything
that
you
want
and
are
quite
independent
this
is
abominable
disgraceful
i
tell
you
how
much
did
abbé
fenil
give
you
to
let
françois
escape
macquart
was
going
to
break
out
angrily
but
madame
rougon
made
him
keep
silent
she
seemed
much
more
uneasy
about
the
consequences
of
the
matter
than
indignant
at
the
crime
itself
what
a
terrible
scandal
there
will
be
if
it
all
comes
out
she
continued
we
ever
refused
you
anything
we
will
talk
together
and
we
will
speak
again
of
that
cornfield
about
which
you
are
so
bitter
against
us
if
rougon
were
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
as
this
he
would
die
of
grief
macquart
could
not
help
smiling
still
he
defended
himself
energetically
and
swore
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
and
had
had
no
hand
in
it
then
as
the
sky
grew
redder
and
doctor
porquier
had
already
gone
downstairs
he
left
the
room
saying
as
if
he
were
anxiously
curious
about
the
matter
am
going
to
see
what
is
happening
it
was
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
who
had
given
the
alarm
there
had
been
an
evening
party
at
the
and
he
was
just
going
to
bed
at
a
few
minutes
before
one
when
he
perceived
a
strange
red
reflection
upon
the
ceiling
of
his
bedroom
going
to
the
window
he
was
struck
with
astonishment
at
seeing
a
great
fire
burning
in
the
mourets
garden
while
a
shadowy
form
which
he
did
not
at
first
recognise
danced
about
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
brandishing
a
blazing
almost
immediately
afterwards
flames
burst
out
from
all
the
openings
on
the
the
hurriedly
put
on
his
trousers
again
called
his
valet
and
sent
the
porter
off
to
summon
the
and
the
authorities
then
before
going
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
he
finished
dressing
himself
and
consulted
his
mirror
to
make
sure
that
his
moustache
was
quite
as
it
should
be
he
was
the
first
to
arrive
in
the
rue
balande
the
street
was
absolutely
deserted
save
for
a
couple
of
cats
which
were
rushing
across
it
will
let
themselves
be
broiled
like
cutlets
in
there
thought
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
astonished
at
the
quiet
sleepy
appearance
of
the
house
on
the
street
side
where
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
the
conflagration
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
but
could
hear
nothing
except
the
roaring
of
the
fire
in
the
well
of
the
staircase
then
he
knocked
at
monsieur
rastoil
door
there
piercing
screams
were
heard
hurried
rustlings
to
and
fro
banging
of
doors
and
stifled
calls
cover
up
your
shoulders
cried
the
presiding
judge
who
rushed
out
on
to
the
pathway
followed
by
madame
rastoil
and
her
younger
daughter
the
one
who
was
still
unmarried
in
her
hurry
aurélie
had
thrown
over
her
shoulders
a
cloak
of
her
father
which
left
her
arms
bare
she
turned
very
red
as
she
caught
sight
of
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
a
terrible
disaster
stammered
the
presiding
judge
will
be
burnt
down
the
wall
of
my
bedroom
is
quite
hot
already
the
two
houses
almost
join
ah
my
dear
i
have
even
stopped
to
remove
the
we
must
organise
assistance
we
ca
stand
by
and
let
all
our
belongings
be
destroyed
in
an
hour
or
two
madame
rastoil
scantily
clothed
in
a
was
bewailing
her
furniture
which
she
had
only
just
had
newly
covered
by
this
time
however
several
neighbours
had
appeared
at
their
windows
the
presiding
judge
summoned
them
to
his
assistance
and
commenced
to
remove
his
effects
from
his
house
he
made
the
his
own
particular
charge
and
brought
them
out
and
deposited
them
on
the
pathway
opposite
when
the
from
the
were
carried
out
he
made
his
wife
and
daughter
sit
down
in
them
and
the
remained
by
their
side
to
reassure
them
yourselves
easy
ladies
he
said
engine
will
be
here
directly
and
then
a
vigorous
attack
will
be
made
upon
the
fire
i
think
i
may
undertake
to
promise
that
your
house
will
be
saved
all
at
once
the
of
the
mourets
house
burst
and
the
flames
broke
out
from
the
first
floor
the
street
was
illumined
by
a
bright
glow
it
was
as
light
as
at
midday
a
drummer
could
be
heard
passing
across
the
place
of
the
some
distance
off
sounding
the
alarm
a
number
of
men
ran
up
and
a
chain
was
formed
to
pass
on
the
buckets
of
water
but
there
were
no
buckets
and
still
the
engine
did
not
arrive
in
the
midst
of
the
general
consternation
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
without
leaving
the
two
ladies
shouted
out
orders
in
a
loud
voice
a
free
passage
the
chain
is
too
closely
formed
down
there
keep
yourselves
two
feet
apart
then
he
turned
to
aurélie
and
said
in
a
low
voice
am
very
much
surprised
that
the
engine
has
not
arrived
yet
it
is
a
new
engine
this
will
be
the
first
time
it
has
been
used
i
sent
the
porter
off
immediately
and
i
told
him
also
to
call
at
the
however
the
gendarmes
arrived
before
the
end
they
kept
back
the
inquisitive
spectators
whose
numbers
increased
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
himself
went
to
put
the
chain
in
a
better
order
as
it
was
bulging
out
in
the
middle
through
the
pushing
of
some
rough
fellows
who
had
run
up
from
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
little
bell
of
was
sounding
the
alarm
with
cracked
notes
and
a
second
drum
beat
faintly
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
near
the
mall
at
last
the
engine
arrived
with
a
noisy
clatter
the
crowd
made
way
for
it
and
the
fifteen
panting
firemen
of
plassans
came
up
at
a
run
however
in
spite
of
monsieur
péqueur
des
intervention
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
engine
was
in
working
order
tell
you
that
it
is
the
piston
that
wo
work
cried
the
captain
angrily
to
the
who
asserted
that
the
nuts
were
too
tightly
screwed
at
last
a
jet
of
water
shot
up
and
the
crowd
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
house
was
now
blazing
from
the
to
the
like
a
huge
torch
the
water
hissed
as
it
fell
into
the
burning
mass
and
the
flames
separating
into
yellow
tongues
seemed
to
shoot
up
still
higher
than
before
some
of
the
firemen
had
mounted
on
to
the
roof
of
the
presiding
judge
house
and
were
breaking
open
the
tiles
with
their
picks
to
limit
the
progress
of
the
fire
all
up
with
the
place
muttered
macquart
who
stood
quietly
on
the
pathway
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
the
conflagration
with
lively
interest
out
in
the
street
a
perfect
had
now
been
established
the
were
arranged
in
a
semicircle
as
though
to
allow
their
occupants
to
view
the
spectacle
at
their
ease
madame
de
condamin
and
her
husband
had
just
arrived
they
had
scarcely
got
back
home
from
the
they
said
when
they
had
heard
the
drum
beating
the
alarm
monsieur
de
bourdeu
monsieur
maffre
doctor
porquier
and
monsieur
delangre
accompanied
by
several
members
of
the
municipal
council
had
also
lost
no
time
in
hastening
to
the
scene
they
all
clustered
round
poor
madame
rastoil
and
her
daughter
trying
to
comfort
and
console
them
with
sympathetic
remarks
after
a
time
most
of
them
sat
down
in
the
and
a
general
conversation
took
place
while
the
engine
snorted
away
half
a
score
yards
off
and
the
blazing
beams
crackled
you
got
my
watch
my
dear
madame
rastoil
inquired
was
on
the
mantelpiece
with
the
chain
yes
i
have
it
in
my
pocket
replied
the
president
trembling
with
emotion
have
got
the
silver
as
well
i
wanted
to
bring
everything
away
but
the
firemen
would
let
me
they
said
it
was
ridiculous
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
still
showed
the
greatest
calmness
and
kindly
attention
assure
you
that
your
house
is
in
no
danger
at
all
he
remarked
force
of
the
fire
is
spent
now
you
may
go
and
put
your
silver
back
in
your
but
monsieur
rastoil
would
not
consent
to
part
with
his
plate
which
he
was
carrying
under
his
arm
wrapped
up
in
a
newspaper
the
doors
are
open
he
stammered
the
house
is
full
of
people
that
i
know
nothing
about
they
have
made
a
hole
in
my
roof
that
will
cost
me
a
pretty
penny
to
put
right
again
madame
de
condamin
now
questioned
the
how
terrible
she
cried
thought
that
the
lodgers
had
had
time
to
escape
has
nothing
been
seen
of
abbé
faujas
knocked
at
the
door
myself
said
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
i
could
make
anyone
hear
when
the
firemen
arrived
i
had
the
door
broken
open
and
i
ordered
them
to
place
the
ladders
against
the
windows
but
nothing
was
of
any
use
one
of
our
brave
gendarmes
who
ventured
into
the
hall
narrowly
escaped
being
suffocated
by
the
smoke
abbé
faujas
has
been
i
suppose
what
a
horrible
death
said
the
fair
octavie
with
a
shudder
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
looked
into
one
another
faces
which
showed
pale
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
conflagration
doctor
porquier
explained
to
them
however
that
death
by
fire
was
probably
not
so
painful
as
they
imagined
the
fire
once
reaches
one
he
said
in
conclusion
can
only
be
a
matter
of
few
seconds
of
course
it
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
violence
of
the
conflagration
monsieur
de
condamin
was
counting
upon
his
fingers
if
madame
mouret
is
with
her
parents
as
is
asserted
that
still
leaves
four
abbé
faujas
his
mother
his
sister
and
his
it
a
pretty
bad
business
just
then
madame
rastoil
inclined
her
head
towards
her
husband
ear
me
my
watch
she
whispered
do
feel
easy
about
it
you
are
always
fidgetting
and
you
may
sit
on
it
someone
now
called
out
that
the
wind
was
carrying
the
sparks
towards
the
and
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
immediately
sprang
up
and
apologising
for
his
departure
hastened
off
to
guard
against
this
new
danger
monsieur
delangre
was
anxious
that
a
last
attempt
should
be
made
to
rescue
the
victims
but
the
captain
of
the
fire
brigade
roughly
told
him
to
go
up
the
ladder
himself
if
he
thought
such
a
thing
possible
he
had
never
seen
such
a
fire
before
he
declared
the
devil
himself
must
have
lighted
it
for
the
house
was
burning
like
a
bundle
of
chips
at
all
points
at
once
the
mayor
followed
by
some
kindly
disposed
persons
then
went
round
into
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
perhaps
he
said
it
would
be
possible
to
get
to
the
windows
from
the
garden
side
would
be
very
magnificent
if
it
were
not
so
sad
remarked
madame
de
condamin
who
was
now
calmer
the
fire
was
certainly
becoming
a
superb
spectacle
showers
of
sparks
rushed
up
in
the
midst
of
huge
blue
flames
chasms
of
glowing
red
showed
themselves
behind
each
of
the
gaping
windows
while
the
smoke
rolled
gently
away
in
a
huge
purplish
cloud
like
the
smoke
from
bengal
lights
set
burning
at
some
display
of
fireworks
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
comfortably
seated
in
their
chairs
leaning
on
their
elbows
and
stretching
out
their
legs
as
they
watched
the
spectacle
before
them
and
whenever
there
was
a
more
violent
burst
of
flames
than
usual
there
came
an
interval
of
silence
broken
by
exclamations
at
some
distance
off
in
the
midst
of
the
flickering
brilliance
which
every
now
and
then
lighted
up
masses
of
serried
heads
there
rose
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
the
sound
of
gushing
water
a
general
confused
uproar
ten
paces
away
the
engine
with
its
regular
snorting
breath
continued
vomiting
streams
of
water
from
its
metal
throat
at
the
third
window
on
the
second
floor
suddenly
cried
monsieur
maffre
can
see
a
bed
burning
quite
distinctly
on
the
left
hand
it
has
yellow
curtains
and
they
are
blazing
like
so
much
paper
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
now
returned
at
a
gentle
trot
to
reassure
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
had
been
a
false
alarm
sparks
he
said
certainly
being
carried
by
the
wind
towards
the
but
they
are
extinguished
in
the
air
before
they
reach
it
there
is
no
further
danger
they
have
got
the
fire
well
in
hand
now
is
it
known
how
the
fire
originated
asked
madame
de
condamin
monsieur
de
bourdeu
asserted
that
he
had
first
of
all
seen
a
dense
smoke
issuing
from
the
kitchen
monsieur
maffre
alleged
on
the
other
hand
that
the
flames
had
first
appeared
in
a
room
on
the
first
floor
but
the
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
official
prudence
and
said
in
a
low
voice
am
much
afraid
that
malice
has
had
something
to
do
with
the
disaster
i
have
ordered
an
inquiry
to
be
made
then
he
went
on
to
tell
them
that
he
had
seen
a
man
lighting
the
fire
with
a
i
saw
him
too
interrupted
aurélie
rastoil
was
monsieur
mouret
this
statement
created
the
greatest
astonishment
the
thing
seemed
impossible
monsieur
mouret
escaping
and
burning
down
his
house
what
a
frightful
story
they
overwhelmed
aurélie
with
questions
she
blushed
and
her
mother
looked
at
her
severely
it
was
scarcely
proper
for
a
young
girl
to
be
constantly
looking
out
of
her
window
at
assure
you
that
i
distinctly
recognised
monsieur
mouret
she
continued
had
not
gone
to
sleep
and
i
got
up
when
i
saw
a
bright
light
monsieur
mouret
was
dancing
about
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
then
the
spoke
out
is
quite
correct
i
recognise
the
unhappy
man
now
he
looked
so
terrible
that
i
was
in
doubt
as
to
who
it
might
be
although
his
face
seemed
familiar
excuse
me
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
and
i
must
go
and
give
some
orders
he
went
away
again
while
the
company
began
to
discuss
this
terrible
affair
of
a
landlord
burning
his
lodgers
to
death
monsieur
de
bourdeu
inveighed
hotly
against
lunatic
asylums
the
surveillance
exercised
in
them
he
said
was
most
imperfect
the
truth
was
that
monsieur
de
bourdeu
was
greatly
afraid
lest
the
prefecture
which
abbé
faujas
had
promised
him
should
be
burnt
away
in
the
fire
before
his
eyes
are
extremely
revengeful
said
monsieur
de
condamin
in
all
simplicity
this
remark
seemed
to
embarrass
everyone
and
the
conversation
dropped
the
ladies
shuddered
slightly
while
the
men
exchanged
peculiar
glances
the
burning
house
had
become
an
object
of
still
greater
interest
now
that
they
knew
whose
hand
had
set
it
on
fire
they
blinked
with
a
thrill
of
delicious
terror
as
they
gazed
upon
the
glowing
pile
and
thought
of
the
drama
that
had
been
enacted
there
old
mouret
is
in
there
that
makes
five
said
monsieur
de
condamin
then
the
ladies
hushed
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
unfeeling
man
the
paloques
meanwhile
had
been
watching
the
fire
since
its
commencement
from
the
window
of
their
they
were
just
above
the
that
had
been
improvised
upon
the
pathway
the
wife
at
last
went
out
and
graciously
offered
shelter
and
hospitality
to
the
rastoil
ladies
and
the
friends
surrounding
them
can
see
very
well
from
our
windows
i
assure
you
she
said
and
as
the
ladies
declined
her
invitation
she
added
will
certainly
take
cold
it
is
a
very
sharp
night
but
madame
de
condamin
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
little
feet
which
showed
from
beneath
her
skirts
dear
no
we
not
at
all
cold
she
said
feet
are
quite
toasted
i
am
very
comfortable
indeed
are
you
cold
mademoiselle
am
really
too
warm
aurélie
replied
could
imagine
that
it
was
a
summer
night
this
fire
keeps
one
quite
warm
and
cosy
everyone
declared
that
it
was
very
pleasant
and
so
madame
paloque
determined
to
remain
there
with
them
and
to
take
a
seat
in
one
of
the
monsieur
maffre
had
just
gone
off
he
had
caught
sight
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
his
two
sons
accompanied
by
guillaume
porquier
who
had
all
three
run
up
from
a
house
near
the
ramparts
to
see
the
fire
the
magistrate
who
was
certain
that
he
had
locked
his
lads
up
in
their
bedroom
dragged
alphonse
and
ambroise
away
by
the
ears
think
we
might
go
off
to
bed
now
said
monsieur
de
bourdeu
who
was
gradually
growing
more
however
monsieur
péqueur
des
saulaies
had
reappeared
again
and
showed
himself
quite
indefatigable
though
he
never
neglected
the
ladies
in
spite
of
the
duties
and
anxieties
of
all
kinds
with
which
he
was
overwhelmed
he
sprang
hastily
forward
to
meet
monsieur
delangre
who
was
just
coming
back
from
the
impasse
des
chevillottes
they
talked
together
in
low
tones
the
mayor
had
apparently
witnessed
some
terrible
sight
for
he
kept
passing
his
hand
over
his
face
as
though
trying
to
drive
away
some
awful
vision
that
was
pursuing
him
the
ladies
could
only
hear
him
murmuring
arrived
too
late
it
was
horrible
he
would
not
answer
any
questions
bourdeu
and
delangre
will
regret
abbé
faujas
monsieur
de
condamin
whispered
in
madame
paloque
ear
had
business
on
hand
with
him
the
latter
replied
quietly
here
is
abbé
bourrette
he
is
weeping
from
genuine
sorrow
abbé
bourrette
who
had
formed
part
of
the
chain
of
men
who
passed
the
buckets
on
was
sobbing
bitterly
the
poor
man
refused
all
consolation
he
would
not
sit
down
but
remained
standing
with
anxious
troubled
eyes
watching
the
last
beams
burn
away
abbé
surin
had
also
been
seen
but
he
had
disappeared
after
picking
up
in
the
crowd
all
the
information
he
could
along
let
us
be
off
to
bed
exclaimed
monsieur
de
bourdeu
is
foolish
of
us
to
stop
here
the
whole
party
rose
it
was
settled
that
monsieur
rastoil
and
his
wife
and
daughter
should
spend
the
night
at
the
paloques
madame
de
condamin
gently
tapped
her
dress
which
had
got
slightly
creased
in
order
to
straighten
it
the
were
pushed
out
of
the
way
and
the
company
lingered
yet
a
few
more
moments
while
bidding
each
other
the
engine
was
still
snorting
and
the
fire
was
dying
down
amidst
dense
black
smoke
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
tramping
of
the
diminishing
crowd
and
the
last
blows
of
a
fireman
axe
striking
down
a
beam
is
all
over
thought
macquart
who
still
kept
his
position
on
the
opposite
pathway
he
remained
there
a
few
moments
longer
listening
to
the
last
words
which
monsieur
de
condamin
exchanged
in
low
tones
with
madame
paloque
said
the
judge
wife
one
will
cry
for
him
unless
that
big
gander
bourrette
he
had
grown
quite
unendurable
and
we
were
nothing
but
his
slaves
his
lordship
the
bishop
i
dare
say
has
got
a
smiling
face
just
now
plassans
is
at
last
delivered
the
rougons
exclaimed
monsieur
de
condamin
must
be
quite
delighted
should
think
so
indeed
the
rougons
must
be
up
in
the
heavens
they
will
inherit
the
abbé
conquest
ah
they
would
have
paid
anyone
well
who
would
have
run
the
risk
of
setting
the
house
on
fire
macquart
went
away
feeling
extremely
dissatisfied
he
was
beginning
to
fear
that
he
had
been
duped
the
joy
of
the
rougons
filled
him
with
consternation
the
rougons
were
crafty
folks
who
always
played
a
double
game
and
whose
opponents
were
quite
certain
to
end
by
getting
the
worst
of
the
struggle
as
macquart
crossed
the
place
of
the
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
never
set
to
work
in
this
blind
way
again
as
he
went
up
to
the
room
where
marthe
lay
dying
he
found
rose
sitting
on
one
of
the
stairs
she
was
in
a
fuming
rage
indeed
i
will
certainly
not
stop
in
the
room
she
cried
wo
look
on
and
see
such
things
let
her
die
without
me
let
her
die
like
a
dog
i
no
longer
have
any
love
for
her
i
have
no
love
for
anyone
to
send
for
the
poor
little
fellow
to
kill
him
and
i
consented
to
go
for
him
i
shall
hate
myself
for
it
all
my
life
he
was
as
white
as
his
nightshirt
the
angel
i
was
obliged
to
carry
him
here
from
the
seminary
i
thought
he
was
going
to
give
up
the
ghost
on
the
way
he
cried
so
oh
it
a
cruel
shame
and
there
he
has
gone
into
the
room
now
to
kiss
her
it
quite
makes
my
flesh
creep
i
wish
the
whole
house
would
topple
down
on
our
heads
and
finish
us
all
off
at
one
stroke
i
will
shut
myself
up
in
some
hole
somewhere
and
live
quite
alone
and
never
see
anyone
again
never
never
one
whole
life
seems
made
up
of
things
that
make
one
weep
and
make
one
angry
macquart
entered
the
room
madame
rougon
was
on
her
knees
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
and
serge
with
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
was
standing
by
the
bedside
supporting
the
head
of
the
dying
woman
she
had
not
yet
regained
consciousness
the
last
flickering
flames

conflagration

a
ruddy
reflection
upon
the
ceiling
of
the
room
at
last
a
convulsive
tremor
shook
marthe
body
she
opened
her
eyes
with
an
expression
of
surprise
and
sat
up
in
bed
to
glance
around
her
then
she
clasped
her
hands
together
with
a
look
of
unutterable
terror
and
