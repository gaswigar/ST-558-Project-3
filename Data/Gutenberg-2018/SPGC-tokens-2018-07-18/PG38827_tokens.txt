preface
the
letters
of
which
these
volumes
are
composed
embrace
the
second
half
of
journeys
in
the
east
extending
over
a
period
of
two
years
they
attempt
to
be
a
faithful
record
of
facts
and
impressions
but
were
necessarily
written
in
haste
at
the
conclusion
of
fatiguing
marches
and
often
in
circumstances
of
great
discomfort
and
difficulty
and
i
relied
for
their
correction
in
the
event
of
publication
on
notes
made
with
much
care
unfortunately
i
was
robbed
of
nearly
the
whole
of
these
partly
on
my
last
journey
in
persia
and
partly
on
the
turkish
frontier
a
serious
loss
which
must
be
my
apology
to
the
reader
for
errors
which
without
this
misfortune
would
not
have
occurred
the
bibliography
of
persia
is
a
very
extensive
one
and
it
may
well
be
that
i
have
little
that
is
new
to
communicate
except
on
a
part
of
luristan
previously
untraversed
by
europeans
but
each
traveller
receives
a
different
impression
from
those
made
upon
his
predecessors
and
i
hope
that
my
book
may
be
accepted
as
an
honest
attempt
to
make
a
popular
contribution
to
the
sum
of
knowledge
of
a
country
and
people
with
which
we
are
likely
to
be
brought
into
closer
relations
as
these
volumes
are
simply
travels
in
persia
and
eastern
asia
minor
and
are
a
book
on
either
the
references
to
such
subjects
as
were
not
within
the
sphere
of
my
observation
are
brief
and
incidental
the
administration
of
government
the
religious
and
legal
systems
the
tenure
of
land
and
the
mode
of
taxation
are
dismissed
in
a
few
lines
and
social
customs
are
only
described
when
i
came
in
contact
with
them
the
ilyats
or
nomadic
tribes
form
a
very
remarkable
element
of
the
population
of
persia
but
i
have
only
noticed
two
of
their
divisions
the
bakhtiari
and
feili
lurs
the
antiquities
of
persia
are
also
passed
over
with
hardly
a
remark
as
well
as
many
other
subjects
which
have
been
threshed
out
by
previous
writers
with
more
or
less
of
accuracy
i
make
these
omissions
with
all
the
more
satisfaction
because
most
that
is
knowable
concerning
persia
will
be
accessible
on
the
publication
of
a
work
now
in
the
press
and
the
persian
by
the
hon
george
curzon
who
has
not
only
travelled
extensively
in
the
country
but
has
bestowed
such
enormous
labour
and
research
upon
it
and
has
had
such
exceptional
opportunities
of
acquiring
the
latest
and
best
official
information
that
his
volumes
may
fairly
be
described
as
exhaustive
it
is
always
a
pleasant
duty
to
acknowledge
kindness
and
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
several
friends
for
the
help
which
they
have
given
me
in
many
ways
and
for
the
trouble
which
some
of
them
have
taken
to
recover
facts
which
were
lost
with
my
notes
as
well
as
for
the
careful
revision
of
a
portion
of
my
letters
in
ms
i
am
indebted
to
the
indian
authorities
for
the
materials
for
a
sketch
map
for
photographs
from
which
many
of
the
illustrations
are
taken
and
for
the
use
of
a
valuable
geographical
report
and
to
thistleton
dyer
director
of
the
royal
botanic
gardens
at
kew
for
the
identification
of
a
few
of
my
botanical
specimens
in
justice
to
the
many
kind
friends
who
received
me
into
their
homes
i
am
anxious
to
disclaim
having
either
echoed
or
divulged
their
views
on
persian
or
turkish
subjects
and
to
claim
and
accept
the
fullest
responsibility
for
the
opinions
expressed
in
these
pages
which
whether
right
or
wrong
are
wholly
my
own
it
is
from
those
who
know
persia
and
kurdistan
the
best
that
i
am
sure
of
receiving
the
most
kindly
allowance
wherever
in
spite
of
an
honest
desire
to
be
accurate
i
have
fallen
into
mistakes
the
retention
not
only
of
the
form
but
of
the
reality
of
diary
letters
is
not
altogether
satisfactory
either
to
author
or
reader
for
the
author
sacrifices
the
literary
and
artistic
arrangement
of
his
materials
and
however
ruthlessly
omissions
are
made
the
reader
is
apt
to
find
himself
involved
in
a
multiplicity
of
minor
details
treated
in
a
fashion
which
he
is
inclined
to
term
slipshod
and
to
resent
the
egotism
which
persistently
clings
to
familiar
correspondence
still
even
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
this
form
of
narrative
i
think
that
letters
are
the
best
mode
of
placing
the
reader
in
the
position
of
the
traveller
and
of
enabling
him
to
share
not
only
first
impressions
in
their
original
vividness
and
the
interests
and
enjoyments
of
travelling
but
the
hardships
difficulties
and
tedium
which
are
their
frequent
accompaniments
for
the
lack
of
vivacity
which
to
my
thinking
pervades
the
following
letters
i
ask
the
reader
indulgence
they
were
originally
written
and
have
since
been
edited
under
the
heavy
and
abiding
shadow
not
only
of
the
loss
of
the
beloved
and
only
sister
who
was
the
inspiration
of
my
former
books
of
travel
and
to
whose
completely
sympathetic
interest
they
owed
whatever
of
brightness
they
possessed
but
of
my
beloved
husband
whose
able
and
careful
revision
accompanied
my
last
volume
through
the
press
believing
that
these
letters
faithfully
reflect
what
i
saw
of
the
regions
of
which
they
treat
i
venture
to
ask
for
them
the
same
kindly
and
lenient
criticism
with
which
my
travels
in
the
far
east
and
elsewhere
were
received
in
bygone
years
and
to
express
the
hope
that
they
may
help
to
lead
towards
that
goal
to
which
all
increase
of
knowledge
of
races
and
beliefs
tends
a
truer
and
kindlier
recognition
of
the
brotherhood
of
man

seen
in

years

resident
in

so
much
ability
judgment
and
tact
as
to
have
earned

going

was
tossed
about
like
a
cork
shipping
deluges
of
spray
and
it
was
so
cold
and
generally
tumultuous
that
it
was
a
relief
to
exchange
the
shallow
waters
of
the
roadstead
for
the
shelter
of

projecting
below
the

house
a
curricle
with

little

us
over

a
part
of

and
round
again
to
the
on
which
long
yellow
surges
were
breaking
thunderously
in
drifts
of
creamy
foam
the
residency
a
large
persian
house
with
that
sort
of
look
which
the
larger
eastern
houses
are
apt
to
have
is
built
round
courtyards
and
has
a
fine
entrance
which
was

is

were
a
welcome
adjunct
to
the
genial
hospitality
of
colonel
ross
and
his
family
for
the
mercury
which
for
the
previous
week
had
ranged
from
to
since
the
sunrise
of
that
day
had
dropped
to
and
the
cold
damp
wind
suggested
an
english
february
even
the
residency
thick
as
its
walls
are
was
invaded
by
sea
sand
and
penetrated
by
the
howlings
and
shriekings
of
the
and
the
low
hiss
at
intervals
of
spray
this
miserable
roadstead
does
a
large
trade
though
every
bale
and
chest
destined
for
the
cities
of
the
interior
must
be
packed
on
backs
for

irregular
and
uncleanly

dead

walls
with
here
and
there
a
low
doorway
bazars
in
which
the
requirements
of
caravans
are
largely
considered
and
in
which
most
of
the
manufactured
goods
are
english
a
great
variety
in
male
attire
some
small
mosques
a
marked
predominance
of
the
arab
physiognomy
and
costume
and
ceaseless
strings
of
asses
bringing
skins
of
water
from
wells
a
mile
from
the
town
are
my
impressions
of
the
first
persian
city
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
persian
element
however
except
in
officialism
and
the
style
of
building
is
not
strong
the
population
being
chiefly
composed
of
gulf
arabs
there
are
nearly
fifty
european
residents
including
the
telegraph
staff
and
the
representatives
of
firms
doing
a
very
large
business
with
england
the
persian

company
hotz
and

and
the
british
india
steam
navigation
company
which
has
enormously
developed

trade
of
the
gulf
bushire
is
the
great
of
travellers
from
india
who
desire
to
go
home
through
persia
by
shiraz
and
persepolis
muleteers
and
the
necessary
outfit
are
obtainable
but
even
the
kindness
of
the
resident
fails
to
overcome
the
standing
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
persian
servant
who
is
both
capable
and
trustworthy
having
been
forewarned
by
him
not
to
trust
to
bushire
for
this
indispensable
article
i
had
brought
from
india
a
persian
of
good
antecedents
and
character
who
desiring
to
return
to
his
own
country
was
willing
to
act
as
my
interpreter
courier
and
sole
attendant
grave
doubts
of
his
ability
to
act
in
the
two
latter
capacities
occurred
to
me
before
i
left
karachi
grew
graver
on
the
voyage
and
were
quite
confirmed
as
we
tossed
about
in
the
residency
launch
where
the
young
persian
gentleman
as
he
styled
himself
sat
bolt
upright
with
a
despairing
countenance
dressed
in
a
tall
hat
a
beautifully
made
european
suit
faultless
tan
boots
and
snowy
collar
and
cuffs
a
man
of
truly
refined
feeling
and
manners
but
hopelessly
out
of
place
i
pictured
him
helpless
among
the
and
roughnesses
of
a
camp
and
anticipated
my
insurmountable
reluctance
to
ask
of
him
menial
service
and
was
glad
to
find
that
the
same
doubts
had
occurred
to
himself
i
lost
no
time
in
interviewing

who
has
served

been

some

and
professes
that
he
is
up

all
the
requirements
of

life
the
next
morning
i
engaged
him
as
man
of
all
work

rough
and
a

etymology
testifies
to
its
origin
the

no

place
with
about

mainly
of

and
hovels
backed
by
a
superb
fringe
of

palms
in
the
rose
flush
of
a
winter
morning
we
steamed
slowly
past
this
diplomatically
famous
confluence
of
the
haffar
and
at
the
angle
of
which
the
persians
have
lately
built
a
quay
a
governor
house
and
a
large
warehouse
in
expectation
of
a
trade
which
shows
few
signs
of
development
a
winter
morning
it
was
indeed
splendid
and
invigorating
after

intersected
by
canals
fringe
its
margin
heavily
and
extend
to
some
distance
inland
the
tide
is
strong
and
such
native
boats
as

loaded
with

and
goods

a

element
of
busy
life
we
anchored
near
basrah
below
the
foreign
settlement
and
had
the
ignominy
of
being
placed
for
hours
in
quarantine
flying
the
degrading
yellow
flag
basrah
has
just
been
grievously
ravaged
by
the
cholera
which
has
not
only
carried
off
three
hundred
of
the
native
population
daily
for
some
time
but
the
british
and
his
children
cholera
still
exists
in
turkey
while
it
is
extinct
in
bombay
and
the
imposition
of
quarantine
on
a
ship
with
a
clean
bill
of
health
seems
devised
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
extract
fees
to
annoy
and
to
produce
a
harassing
impression
of
turkish
officialism
after
this
detention
we
steamed
up
to
the
anchorage
which
is
in
front
of
a
few
large
bungalows
which
lie
between
the
belt
of
palms
and
the

swamp
with
no
outlet
but
the

canals
exposing
at
low
water
deep
impassable
and
malodorous
slime
separating
the

a
climate
which
is
damp
hot
malarious
and
prostrating
except
for
a
few
weeks
in
winter
and
a
total
absence
of
all
the
resources
and
amenities
of
civilisation
make
basrah
one
of
the
least
desirable
places
to
which
europeans
are
exiled
by
the
exigencies
of
commerce
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
few
residents
exercise
unbounded
hospitality
which
is
the
most
grateful
memory
which
the
stranger
retains
of

the
busiest
month
here
the
magnitude
of
the

industry
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that

of

were
exported
from

the

in

planted
on

it
is
said
that
there
are

of

but
only
a

are
known
to

these
great
sombre

forests

which
no

are
of

artificial
and
depend
upon

the

mohammed
said
wisely
honour
the

it
is
your
paternal
aunt
one
soon
learns
here
that
it
not
only
provides
the
people
with
nutritious
food
but
with
building
materials
as
well
as
with
fuel
carpets
ropes
and
mats
but
it
is
the
least
beautiful
of
the
palms
and
the
dark
monotonous
masses
along

tuesday
we
have
been
stemming
the
strong
flood
of

for
three
bright
winter
days
in
which
to
sit
by
a
stove
and
sleep
under
a
pile
of

have
been
real
luxuries
after
the

her
once
a
fortnight
at
a
considerable
loss
between
mohammerah
and
ahwaz
her
isolated
position
and
diminutive
size
are
a
curious
commentary
on
the
flourish
of
trumpets
and
of
exultation
with
which
the
english
newspapers
announced
the
very
poor
concession
of
leave
to
run
steamers
on
the
karun
between
the
and
ahwaz
since
this
letter
was
written
things
have
taken
rather
a
singular
turn
and
the
development
of
trade
on
the
karun
has
partly
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
trading
corporation
of
persians
the
company
by
them
and
under
their
representative
partner
haja
mahomad
a
man
of
great
energy
the
formidable
rapids
at
ahwaz
are
being
circumvented
by
the
construction
of
a
tramway
yards
long
which
is
proceeding
steadily
a
merchants

has
already
been
built
on
the
river
bank
at
the

commencement
of
the
tramway
and
a

and

along
with
a

have
already
been
opened
by
men
brought

a

where
native
craft
are
to
lie
is
being
constructed
of
hewn
stone
blocks
and
sections
of
circular
pillars
remains
of
the
ancient
city
the
company
has
a
small
steamer
the
plying
on
the
lower
karun
chiefly
as
a
tug
taking
up
two
arab
boats
of
tons
each
lashed
alongside
of

on
her
transference
at
the
spring

of
this
year

above
ahwaz
the
a
steam
launch
of
about
sixty
tons
belonging
to
the
governor
of
mohammerah
takes
her
place
below
and
a
second
steamer
belonging
to
the
same
company
is
now
running
on
the
lower
stream
poles
from
zanzibar
have
been
distributed
for
a
telegraph
line
from
mohammerah
to
ahwaz
the
lynch
have
placed
a
fine
river
steamer
of
tons
on
the
route
but
this
enterprising
firm
and
english
capitalists
generally
are
being
partially
cut
out
by
the
singular
go
of
this
persian
company
which
not
only
appears
to
have
strong
support
from
government
quarters
but
has
gained
the
of
the
and
wealthy
sheikh
mizal
whose
personal
influence
in
arabistan
is
very
great
and
who
has
hitherto
been
an
obstacle
to
the
opening
of
trade
on
the
karun
a
great
change
for
the
better
has
taken
place
in
the
circumstances
of
the
population
and
villages
attracted
by
trade
are
springing
up
which
the
company
is
doing
its
best
to
encourage
the
is
very
light
and
the
cultivators
are
receiving
every
encouragement
much
wheat
was
exported
last
year
and
there
is
a
brisk
demand
for
river
lands
on
leases
of
sixty
years
for
the
cultivation
of
cotton
cereals
and
date
palms
persian
soldiers
all
have
their
donkeys
and
at
ahwaz
a
brisk
and
amusing
competition
is
going
on
between
the
soldiers
of
a
fine
regiment
stationed
there
and
the
arabs
for
the
transport
of
goods
past
the
rapids
and
for
the
conveyance
of
tramway
and
building
materials
this
competition
is
enabling
goods
to
pass
the
rapids
cheaply
and
expeditiously
one
interesting
feature
connected
with
these
works
is
the
rapidly
increased
of
the
arabs
in
less
than
a
year
labour
at
a
day
has
put
quite
a
number
of
them
in
possession
of
a
pair
of
donkeys
and
a
plough
and
wherewith
to
cultivate
government
lands
on
their
own
account
besides
leaving
a
small
balance
in
hand
on
which
to
live
without
having
to
borrow
on
the
coming
crop
at
frightfully
usurious
rates
until
now
the
sheikhs
have
been
able
to
command
labour
for
little
more
than
the
poorest
food
and
now
many
of
the
very
poor
who
depended
on
them
have
started
as
small
farmers
and
things
are
rapidly
changing
the
careful
observer
from
whose
report
on
persia
to
the
foreign
office
no
i
have
transferred
the
foregoing
facts
wrote
in
january
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
whole
arab
population
on
the
river
banks
hard
at
work
taking
advantage
of
the
copious
rain
which
had
just
fallen
every
available
animal
fit
for
draught
was
yoked
to
the
plough
horses
mules
bullocks
and
donkeys
and
even
mares
with
their
foals
following
them
up
the
furrows
this
which
is
practically
a
persian
opening
of
the
trade
of
the
karun
is
not
what
was
expected
however
much
it
was
to
be
desired
after
a
journey
of
nine
months
through
persia
i
am
strongly
of
opinion
that
if
the
empire
is
to
have
a
solid
and
permanent
resurrection
it
must
be
through
the
enterprise
of
persians
aided
it
may
be
by
foreign
skill
and
capital
though
the
less
of
the
latter
that
is
employed
the
more
hopefully
i
should
regard
the
persian
future
the
company
and
the
lynch
may
possibly
unite
and
the
new
road
company
may
join
with
them
in
making
a
regular
transport
service
by
river
and
road
to
tihran
by
which
england
may
pour
her
manufactured
goods
even
into
northern
persia
as
this
route
would
compete
successfully
both
with
the
baghdad
and
trebizond
routes
already
owing
to
the
improved
circumstances
of
the
people
the
import
of
english
and
indian
cotton
goods
and
of
sugar
has
increased
the
latter
which
is
french
from
its
low
price
only
a
pound
in
the
gulf
pushing
its
way
as
far
north
as
sultanabad
unfortunately
the
shadow
of
russia
hangs
over
the
future
of
persia
at
present
two
english
and
four
turkish
boats
run
on
the
tigris
they
are
necessarily
of
light
draught
as
the
river
is
shallow
at
certain
seasons
and
is
full
of
shifting
the

a
comfortable
boat
with
a
superabundance
of
excellent
food
her
saloon
and
engines
are
on
the
main
deck
which
is
open
fore
and
aft
and
has
above
it
a
fine
hurricane
deck
on
the
fore
part
of
which
the
deck
passengers
a
motley
crowd
encamp
she
is
fully
loaded
with
british
goods
the
first
object
of
passing
interest
was
kornah
reputed
among
the
arabs
to
be
the
site
of
the
garden
of
eden
a
tongue
of
land
at
the
junction
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
the
garden
of
eden
contains
a
village
and
bright
fires
burned
in
front
of
the
houses
women
in
red
and
white
and
turbaned
men
in
brown
flitted
across
the
firelight
there
was
a
mass
of
vegetation
chiefly
palms
with
a
number
of
native
vessels
moored
to
their
stems
and
a
leaning
minaret
a
frosty
moonlight
glorified
the
broad
turbid
waters
kornah
and
the
euphrates
were
left
in
shadow
and
we
turned
up
the
glittering
waterway
of
the
tigris
the
night
was
too
keenly
frosty
for
any
dreams
of
paradise
even
in
this
classic
chald√¶a
and
under
a
sky
blazing
down
to
the
level
horizon
with
the
countless
stars
which
were
not
to
outnumber
the
children
of
faithful
abraham
four
hours
after
leaving
kornah
we
passed
the
reputed
tomb
of
ezra
the
prophet
at
a
distance
and
in
the
moonlight
it
looked
handsome
there
is
a
buttressed
river
wall
and
above
it
some
long
buildings
the
centre
one
surmounted
by
a
tiled
dome
the
tigris
is
so
fierce
and
rapid
and
swallows
its
alluvial
banks
so
greedily
that
it
is
probable
that
some
of
the
buildings
described
by
the
hebrew
traveller
benjamin
of
tudela
as
existing
in
the
twelfth
century
were
long
since
carried
away
the
tomb
is
held
in
great
veneration
not
only
by
jews
and
moslems
but
also
by
oriental
christians
it
is
a
great
place
of
jewish
pilgrimage
and
is
so
venerated
by
the
arabs
that
it
needs
no
guard
hadji
brought
my
breakfast
or
as
he
called
it
the
grub
the
next
morning
and
i
contemplated
the
son
of
abraham
with
some
astonishment
he
had
discarded
his
turban
and
and
looked
a
regular
uncivilised
desert
ishmaelite
with
knives
and
rosaries
in
his
belt
and
his
head
muffled
in
a
a
yellow
silk
shawl
striped
with
red
with
one
point
and
tassels
half
a
yard
long
hanging
down
his
back
and
fastened
round
his
head
by
three
coils
of
rope
a
loose
coat
with
a
gay
girdle
breeks

a

of

the

which
have
changed
little
since

to

the
current
is
very
strong
and
the
slow
progress
is
rendered
slower
at
this
season
of
low
water
by
the
frequent
occurrence
of
of
which
one
is
usually
made
aware
by
a
jolt
a
grinding
sound
a
cessation
of
motion
some
turns
astern
and
then
full
speed
ahead
which
often
overcomes
the
obstacle
some
hours
delay
and
the

injured
were
the
most
serious
disasters
brought
about
and
in
spite
of
the
shallows
at
this
season
the
tigris
is
a
noble
river
and
the
voyage
is
truly
fascinating
not
that
there
are
many
remarkable
objects
but
the
desert
atmosphere
and
the
desert
freedom
are
in
themselves
delightful
the
dust
and
are
the
dust
and
of
mighty
empires
and
there
are
countless
associations
with
the
earliest
past
of
which
we
have
any
records
aimarah
a
rising
turkish
town
of
about
people
built
at
a
point
where
the
river
turns
at
a
sharp
angle
to
the
left
is
interesting
as
showing
what
commerce
can
create
even
here
in
less
than
twenty
years
a
caravan
route
into
persia
was
opened
and
aimarah
does
a
somewhat
busy
trade
brick
buildings
with
projecting
lattice
windows
run
a
good
way
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
is
so
steep
and
irregular
that
the
crowd
which
thronged
it
when
the
steamer
made
fast
was
shown
to
great
advantage
osmanlis
greeks
persians
sabeans
jews
of
great
height
and
superb
known
by
turbans
and
a
predominating
arab
element
we
walked
down
the
long
broad
covered
bazar
with
a
broken
water
channel
in
the
middle
where
there
were
crowds
solely
of
men
meat
game
bread
fruit
grain
lentils
pack
saddles
manchester
cottons
silversmiths
and
scribes
and
heard
the
roar
of
business
and
the
thin
shouts
of
boys
unaccustomed
to
the
sight
of
european
women
the
crowds
pressed
and
followed
picking
at
my
clothes
and
singing
snatches
of
songs
which
were
not
complimentary
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
violating
rigid
custom
in
appearing
in
a
hat
and
gauze
veil
rather
than
in
a
and
face
cloth
but
the
mistake
was
made
unpleasantly
apparent
in
moslem
towns
women
go
about
in
companies
and
never
walk
with
men
we
visited
an
enclosed
square
where
there
are
barracks
for
gendarmes
the
kadi
court
and
the
prison
which
consists
of
an
open
grating
like
that
of
a
menagerie
a
covered
space
behind
and
dark
cells
or
dens
opening
upon
it
all
better
than
the
hovels
of
the
peasantry
there
were
a
number
of
prisoners
well
clothed
and
apparently
well
fed
to
whom
we
were
an
obvious
diversion
but
the
guards
gesticulated
shouted
and
brandished
their
making
us
at
last
understand
that
our
presence
in
front
of
the
grating
was
forbidden
after
seeing
a
large
barrack
yard
and
walking
still
pursued
by
a
crowd
round
the
forlorn
outskirts
of
aimarah
which
include
a
sabean
village
we
visited
the
gold
and
silversmiths
shops
where
the
sabeans
were
working
at
their
craft
of
which
in
this
region
they
have
nearly
a
monopoly
not
only
settling
temporarily
in
the
towns
but
visiting
the
arab
encampments
on
the
plains
where
they
are
always
welcome
as
the
makers
and
repairers
of
the
ornaments
with
which
the
women
are
loaded
these
craftsmen
and
others
of
the
race
whom
i
have
seen
differ
greatly
from
the
arabs
in
appearance
being
white
rather
than
brown
very
white
very
pale
with
hair
large
gentle
intelligent
eyes
small
straight
noses
and
small
mouths
the
handsome
faces
of
these
christians
of
john
are
very
pleasing
in
their
expression
and
there
was
a
dainty
cleanliness
about
their
persons
and
white
clothing
significant
of
those
frequent
ablutions
of
both
which
are
so
remarkable
a
part
of
their
religion
the
children
at
aimarah

generally
in
the
riparian
villages
wear
very
handsome
chased
convex

each
as
large
as

the

are
left

on

an

on
the
verge
of
a
high
bank
above
the

we
landed
again
and
ragamuffin

pressed
very
much
upon
us

ragamuffin
grotesquely

said
that

it

that

describe
it
as
steadily
growing
worse

this

its
superb

in

has
been
even
in

magnificent
enough
in

days
when

within
its
stately
walls
its
gaunt

shattered
remains
have
even
still
a
mournful
grandeur
about
them

they
have
suffered
so
severely
from
the
barbarous
removal
of
the

the
fall
of
much
of

to
be
altogether
disappointing

the
deck
as
soon
as
we
anchored
swarms
of
clustered
round
us
and
swarms
of
officials
and
porters
invaded
the
deck
some
of
the
passengers
had
landed
two
hours
before
others
had
proceeded
to
their
destinations
at
once
and
as
my
friends
had
not
come
off
i
was
alone
for
some
time
in
the
middle
of
a
tremendous
babel
in
which
every
man
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
all
together
hadji
assuming
a
deportment
of
childish
helplessness
certain
officials
under
cover
of
bribes
lavished
on
my
behalf
by
a
man
who
spoke
english
professed
to
let
my
baggage
pass
unopened
then
a
higher
official
with
a
sword
knocked
hadji
down
then
a
man
said
that
everything
would
be
all
right
if
i
would
bestow
another
gold
about
on
the
officers
and
i
was
truly
glad
when
kind
captain
dougherty
with
sutton
came
alongside
in
the
boat
and
brought
me
ashore
the
baggage
was
put
into
another
of
her
boats
but
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
it
was
removed
and
was
taken
to
the
where
they
insisted
that
some
small
tent
poles
in
a
cover
were
guns
and
smashed
a
box
of
dates
in
the
idea
that
it
was
tobacco
the
church
mission
house
in
which
i
am
receiving
hospitality
is
a
native
house
though
built
and
decorated
by
persians
as
also
are
several
of
the
consulates
it
is
in
a
narrow
roadway
with
blank
walls
a
part
of
the
european
quarter
a
door
of
much
strength
admits
into
a
small
courtyard
round
which
are
some
of
the
servants
quarters
and
reception
rooms
for
moslem
visitors
and
within
this
again
is
a
spacious
and
handsome
courtyard
round
which
are
kitchens
domestic
offices
and
the
which
play
an
important
part
in
eastern
life
these
are
rooms
usually
with
arched
fronts
filled
in
with
latticework
they
are
lofty
and
their
vaulted
roofs
are
supported
in
rich
men
houses
on
pillars
the
well
of
the
household
is
often
found
within
the
general
effect
of
this
one
is
that
of
a
crypt
and
it
was
most
appropriate
for
the
divine
service
in
english
which
greeted
my
arrival
the
cold
of
it
was
however
frightful
it
was
only
when
the
holy
communion
was
over
that
i
found
that
i
was
wearing
hadji
revolver
and
cartridge
belt
under
my
cloak
which
he
had
begged
me
to
put
on
to
save
them
from
confiscation
in
these
vaulted
chambers
both
europeans
and
natives
spend
the
hot
season
sleeping
at
night
on
the
roofs
above
this
lower
floor
are
the
winter
apartments
which
open
upon
a
fine
stone
balcony
running
round
three
sides
of
the
court
on
the
river
side
of
the
house
there
is
an
orange
garden
which
just
now
might
be
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
a
terrace
below
which
is
the
noble
swirling
tigris
and
beyond
a
dark
belt
of
palms
these
rooms
on
the
river
front
have
large
projecting
windows
six
in
a
row
with
screens
which
slide
up
and
down
and
those
which
look
to
the
courtyard
are
secluded
by
very
beautiful
fretwork
the
used
as
a
dormitory
is
a
superb
room
in
which
exquisitely
beautiful
ceiling
and
wall
decorations
in
shades
of
fawn
enriched
with
gold
and
fretwork
windows
suggest
oriental
feeling
at
every
turn
the
of
this
room
is
said
to
be
distinctively
persian
and
is
very
charming
the
house
though
large
is
inconveniently
crowded
with
the
medical
and
clerical
mission
families
two
lady
missionaries
and
two
guests
each
apartment
has
two
rows
of
vaulted
recesses
in
its
walls
and
very
fine
cornices
above
it
is
impossible
to
warm
the
rooms
but
the
winter
is
very
short
and
brilliant
and
after
ulsters
greatcoats
and
fur
cloaks
have
been
worn
for
breakfast
the
sun
mitigates
the
temperature
b
letter
ii
baghdad
baghdad
is
too
well
known
from
the
careful
descriptions
given
of
it
by
eastern
travellers
to
justify
me
in
lingering
upon
it
in
detail
and
i
will
only
record
a
few
impressions
which
are
decidedly
de
for
the
weather
is
splendid
making
locomotion
a
pleasure
and
the
rough
irregular
roadways
which
at
other
seasons
are
deep
in
foul
and
choking
dust
or
in
mud
and
pestilential
slime
are
now
firm
and
not
remarkably
dirty
a
little
earlier
than
this
the
richer
inhabitants
who
have
through
the
summer
in
their
dim
and
latticed
emerge
and
pitch
their
tents
in
the
plains
of
ctesiphon
where
the
men
find
a
stimulating
amusement
in
hunting
the
boar
but
it
is
now
the
season
in
the
city
the
liveliest
and
busiest
time
of
the
year
the
cholera
which
is
believed
to
have
claimed
victims
has
departed
and
the
wailing
of
the
women
which
scarcely
ceased
day
or
night
for
a
month
is
silent
the
jewish
troubles
which
apparently
rose
out
of
the
indignation
of
the
moslems
at
the
burial
within
the
gates
contrary
to
a
strict
edict
on
the
subject
of
a
rabbi
who
died
of
cholera
have
subsided
and
the
motley
populations
and
their
yet
more
motley
creeds
are
for
the
time
at
peace
in
the
daytime
there
is
a
roar
or
hum
of
business
mingled
with
braying
of
asses
squeals
of
belligerent
horses
yells
of
and
muleteers
beating
of
drums
shouts
of
beggars
ejaculations
of
fakirs
snatches
of
discordant
music
and
in
short
a
chorus
of
sounds
unfamiliar
to
western
ears
but
the
nights
are
so
still
that
the
swirl
of
the
tigris
as
it
hurries
past
is
distinctly
heard
only
the
long
melancholy
call
to
prayer
or
the
wail
of
women
over
the
dead
or
the
barking
of
dogs
breaks
the
silence
which
at
sunset
falls
as
a
pall
over
baghdad
under
the
blue
sunny
sky
the
river
view
is
very
fine
the
river
itself
is
imposing
from
its
breadth
and
volume
and
in
the
gorgeous
sunsets
with
a
sky
of
crimson
flame
and
the
fronds
of
the
dark
date
palms
mirrored
in
its
reddened
waters
it
looks
really
beautiful
the
city
is
stately
enough
as
far
as
the
general
of
the
river
front
goes
and
its
river
agreeably
surprises
me
the
tigris
besides
being
what
may
be
called
the
main
street
divides
baghdad
into
two
unequal
parts
and
though
the
city
on
the
left
bank
has
almost
a
monopoly
of
picturesque
and
somewhat
stately
irregularity
in
the
houses
of
fair
height
whose
lattices
and
oriel
windows
overhang
the
stream
from
an
environment
of
orange
gardens
the
dark
date
groves
dignify
the
meaner
buildings
of
the
right
bank
the
rush
of
a
great
river
is
in
itself
attractive
and
from
the
roof
of
this
house
the
view
is
fascinating
with
the
ceaseless
movements
of
hundreds
of
boats
and
the
constant
traffic
of
men
horses
asses
and
caravans
across
the
great
bridge
of
boats
and
the
long
lines
of
buildings
which
with
more
or
less
picturesqueness
line
the
great
waterway
without
the
wearisomeness
of
there
is
much
to
be
seen
in
baghdad
and
though
much
that
would
be
novel
to
a
from
the
west
is
familiar
to
me
after
two
years
of
eastern
travel
there
is
a
great
deal
that
is
really
interesting
the
accumulating
at
their
landing
freighted
with
the
products
of
the
upper
tigris
the
transpontine
city
in
which
country
produce
takes
the
foremost
place
the
tramway
to
kazimain
constructed
during
the
brief
valiship
of
midhat
pasha
on
which
the
last
journey
of
the
day
is
always
performed
at
a
gallop
que
the
caravans
of
asses
each
one
with
a
huge
fish
the
fish
of
tobias
hanging
across
its
back
the
strings
of
the
same
humble
animal
carrying
skins
of
water
from
the
river
throughout
the
city
the
tombs
the
mosques
the
churches
the
great
caravans
of
mules
and
camels
almost
monopolising
the
narrow
roadways
arabs
and
osmanlis
on
showy
horses
persians
turks
arabs
jews
armenians
chald√¶ans
in
all
the
variety
of
their
picturesque
national
costumes
to
which
the
niggardly
clothing
of
a
chance
european
acts
as
an
ungraceful
foil
persian
dead
usually
swaddled
making
their
last
journey
on
mule
or
horseback
to
the
holy
ground
at
kerbela
and
the
occasional
march
of
horse
or
foot
through
the
thronged
bazars
are
among
the
hourly
sights
of
a
city
on
which
european
influence
is
scarcely
if
at
all
perceptible
turkish
statistics
must
be
received
with
caution
and
the
population
of
baghdad
may
not
reach
souls
but
it
has
obviously
recovered
wonderfully
from
the
effects
of
war
plague
inundation
and
famine
and
looks
busy
and
fairly
prosperous
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
account
given
of
its
misery
and
decay
in
baillie
fraser
charming
in
reads
like
a
story
of
the
last
century
if
nothing
remains
of
the
glories
of
the
city
of
the
caliphs
it
is
certainly
for
turkey
a
busy
growing
and
passably
wealthy
capital
it
is
said
to
have
a
hundred
mosques
minarets
and
fifteen
domes
but
i
have
not
counted
them
its
bazars
which
many
people
regard
as
the
finest
in
the
east
outside
of
stamboul
are
of
enormous
extent
and
very
great
variety
many
are
of
brick
with
domed
roofs
and
sides
arcaded
both
above
and
below
and
are
wide
and
airy
some
are
of
wood
all
are
covered
and
admit
light
scantily
only
from
the
roof
those
which
supply
the
poorer
classes
are
apt
to
be
ruinous
and
squalid
to
say
the
truth
with
an
air
of
decay
about
them
and
their
roofs
are
merely
rough
timber
roughly
thatched
with
reeds
or
date
tree
fronds
of
splendour
there
is
none
anywhere
and
of
cleanliness
there
are
few
traces
the
old
narrow
and
filthy
bazars
in
which
the
gold
and
silversmiths
ply
their
trade
are
of
all
the
most
interesting
the
trades
have
their
separate
localities
and
the
buyer
who
is
in
search
of
cotton
goods
silk
stuffs
carpets
cotton
yarn
gold
and
silver
thread
clothing
weapons
saddlery
rope
fruit
meat
grain
fish
jewellery
muslins
copper
pots
has
a
whole
alley
of
contiguous
shops
devoted
to
the
sale
of
the
same
article
to
choose
from
at
any
hour
of
daylight
at
this
season
progress
through
the
bazars
is
slow
they
are
crowded
and
almost
entirely
with
men
it
is
only
the
poorer
women
who
market
for
themselves
and
in
twos
and
threes
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
in
a
whole
afternoon
among
thousands
of
men
i
saw
only
five
women
tall
shapeless
bundles
carried
mysteriously
along
rather
by
high
loose
leather
boots
than
by
feet
the
face
is
covered
with
a
thick
black
gauze
mask
or
cloth
and
the
head
and
remainder
of
the
form
with
a
dark
blue
or
black
sheet
which
is
clutched
by
the
hand
below
the
nose
the
walk
is
one
of
tottering
decrepitude
all
the
business
transacted
in
the
bazars
is
a
matter
of
bargaining
and
as
arabs
shout
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
buyers
and
sellers
are
equally
keen
the
roar
is
tremendous
great
as
in
cairo
occur
frequently
in
the
larger
ones
from
a
hundred
to
two
hundred
men
are
seen
lounging
at
one
time
on
the
broad
matted
seats
shouting
chaffering
drinking
coffee
or
and
smoking
or
negro
attendants
supply
their
wants
these
are
the
clubs
of
baghdad
whatever
of
public
opinion
exists
in
a
country
where
the
recognised
use
of
words
is
to
conceal
thought
is
formed
in
them
they
are
centres
of
business
likewise
and
much
of
the
noise
is
due
to
bargaining
and
they
are
also
manufactories
of
rumours
scandals
and
fanaticism
the
great
caravanserais
such
as
the
magnificent
khan
othman
are
also
resorts
of
merchants
for
the
display
and
sale
of
their
goods
europeans
never
make
purchases
in
the
bazars
they
either
have
the
goods
from
which
they
wish
to
make
a
choice
brought
to
their
houses
or
their
servants
bargain
for
them
getting
a
commission
both
from
buyer
and
seller
the
splendour
of
the
east
if
it
exists
at
all
is
not
to
be
seen
in
the
bazars
the
jewelled
daggers
the
cloth
of
silver
and
gold
the
diaphanous
silk
tissues
the
brocaded
silks
the
rich
embroideries
the
damascened
sword
blades
the
finer
carpets
the
inlaid
armour
the
cunning
work
in
brass
and
inlaid
bronze
and
all
the
articles
of
and
of
real
or
spurious
value
are
carefully
concealed
by
their
owners
and
are
carried
for
display
with
much
secrecy
and
mystery
to
the
houses
of
their
ordinary
customers
and
to
such
european
strangers
as
are
reported
to
be
willing
to
be
victimised
trade
in
baghdad
is
regarded
by
europeans
and
large
capitalists
as
growing
annually
more
depressed
and
unsatisfactory
but
this
is
not
the
view
of
the
small
traders
chiefly
jews
and
christians
who
start
with
a
capital
of
or
upwards
and
by
buying
some
cheap
lot
in
bombay
gay
handkerchiefs
perfumery
shoes
socks
buttons
tin
boxes
with
mirror
lids
scissors
toys
and
the
like
bid
fair
to
make
small
fortunes
the
amount
of
perfumery
and
rubbish
piled
in
these
ramshackle
shops
is
wonderful
the
trader
who
picks
up
a
desert
arab
for
a
customer
and
sells
him
a
knife
or
a
mirror
box
or
a
packet
of
candles
is
likely
to
attract
to
himself
a
large
trade
for
when
once
the
unmastered
pastoral
hordes
of
al
jaz
ra
trak
and
stram
ya
see
such
objects
the
desire
of
possession
is
aroused
and
the
refuse
of
manchester
and
birmingham
will
find
its
way
into
every
tent
in
the
desert
the
best
bazars
are
the
least
crowded
though
once
in
them
it
is
difficult
to
move
and
the
strings
of
asses
laden
with
skins
of
water
are
a
great
nuisance
the
is
also
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
ridden
down
by
horsemen
or
squeezed
into
a
jelly
by
the
passage
of
caravans
it
is
in
the
meat
vegetable
cotton
oil
grain
fruit
and
fish
bazars
that
the
throngs
are
busiest
and
noisiest
and
though
cucumbers
the
great
joy
of
the
turkish
palate
are
over
vegetables
of
sorts
are
abundant
and
the
slant
broken
sunbeams
fall
on
pyramids
of
fruit
and
glorify
the
warm
colouring
of
melons
apples
and
pomegranates
a
melon
of
lbs
weight
can
be
got
for
a
penny
a
sheep
for
five
or
six
shillings
and
fish
for
something
like
a
farthing
per
pound
that
is
the
fish
of
tobias
the
monster
of
the
tigris
waters
which
is
largely
eaten
by
the
poor
poultry
and
game
are
also
very
cheap
and
the
absolute
necessaries
of
life
such
as
broken
wheat
for
porridge
oil
flour
and
cheese
cost
little
abound
but
their
viands
are
not
tempting
and
the
bazars
are
pervaded
by
a
pungent
odour
of
hot
sesamum
oil
and
rancid
fat
frying
being
a
usual
mode
of
cooking
in
these
restaurants
an
impassive
turk
silently
smoking
sits
on
a
platform
at
each
turkish
shop
door
he
shows
his
goods
as
if
he
had
no
interest
in
them
and
whether
he
sells
or
not
seems
a
matter
of
indifference
so
that
he
can
return
to
his
pipe
it
is
not
to
him
that
the
overpowering
din
is
owing
but
to
the
agitated
eagerness
of
the
other
nationalities
the
charm
of
the
bazars
lies
in
the
variety
of
race
and
costume
and
in
the
splendid
of
the
greater
number
of
the
men
the
european
looks
nowhere
the
natural
look
of
a
moslem
is
one
of
but
no
words
can
describe
the
scorn
and
lofty
pharisaism
which
sit
on
the
faces
of
the
seyyids
the
descendants
of
mohammed
whose
hands
and
even
garments
are
kissed
reverently
as
they
pass
through
the
crowd
or
the
wrathful
melancholy
mixed
with
pride
which
gives
a
fierceness
to
the
dignified
bearing
of
the
magnificent
beings
who
glide
through
the
streets
their
white
turbans
or
shawl
their
gracefully
flowing
robes
their
richly
embroidered
their
kashmir
girdles
their
inlaid
pistols
their
dirks
and
the
predominance
of
red
throughout
their
clothing
aiding
the
general
effect
yet
most
of
these
grand
creatures
with
their
lofty
looks
and
regal
stride
would
be
accessible
to
a
bribe
and
would
not
despise
even
a
perquisite
these
are
the
the
scribes
the
traders
and
the
merchants
of
the
city
the
bedouin
and
the
city
arabs
dress
differently
and
are
among
the
marked
features
of
the
streets
the
is
a
very
coarse
shirt
of
unbleached
homespun
cotton
rarely
clean
over
which
the
sheikhs
and
richer
men
wear
a
robe
of
striped
silk
or
cotton
with
a
kashmir
girdle
of
a
shawl
pattern
in
red
on
a
white
ground
the
poor
wear
shirts
of
coarse
hair
or
cotton
without
a
robe
the
invariable
feature
of
arab
dress
is
the
a
long
cloak
sleeveless
but
with
holes
through
which
to
pass
the
arms
and
capable
of
many
adaptations
it
conceals
all
superabundance
and
deficiency
of
attire
and
while
it
has
the
dignity
of
the
by
day
it
has
the
utility
of
a
blanket
by
night
the
is
very
hard
being
made
of
worsted
in
broad
brown
and
white
or
black
and
white
perpendicular
stripes
the
poorest
is
of
coarse
brown
worsted
and
even
of
i
saw
many
men
who
were
destitute
of
any
clothing
but
tattered
tied
round
their
waists
by
frayed
hair
ropes
the
is
the
distinctive
national
costume
of
the
arabs
the
is
not
the
turban
but
a
shawl
of
very
thick
silk
woven
in
irregular
stripes
of
yellow
and
red
with
long
cords
and
tassels
depending
made
of
the
twisted
woof
this
handsome
square
is
doubled
triangularly
the
double
end
hangs
down
the
back
and
the
others
over
the
shoulders
a
rope
of
is
wound
several
times
round
the
crown
of
the
head
when
the
weather
is
cold
being
like
all
orientals
very
sensitive
in
their
heads
they
bring
one
side
of
the
shawl
over
the
whole
of
the
face
but
the
eyes
and
tuck
it
in
in
great
cold
only
exposing
one
eye
and
in
great
heat
also
most
moslems
shave
the
head
but
the
arabs
let
their
hair
grow
very
long
and
wear
it
in
a
number
of
long
plaits
and
these
mixed
up
with
the
long
coloured
tassels
of
the
and
the
dark
glittering
eyes
looking
out
from
under
the
yellow
silk
give
them
an
appearance
of
extreme
wildness
aided
by
the
long
guns
which
they
carry
and
their
long
desert
stride
the
arab
moves
as
if
he
were
the
ruler
of
the
country
though
the
grip
of
the
osmanli
may
be
closing
on
him
his
eyes
are
deeply
set
under
shaggy
eyebrows
his
nose
is
high
and
sharp
he
is
long
and
thin
his
profile
suggests
a
bird
of
prey
and
his
demeanour
a
fierce
independence
the
arab
women
go
about
the
streets
unveiled
and
with
the
covering
their
very
poor
clothing
but
it
is
not
clutched
closely
enough
to
conceal
the
extraordinary
tattooing
which
the
bedouin
women
everywhere
regard
as
ornamental
there
are
artists
in
baghdad
who
make
their
living
by
this
mode
of
decorating
the
person
and
vie
with
each
other
in
the
elaboration
of
their
patterns
i
saw
several
women
tattooed
with
two
wreaths
of
blue
flowers
on
their
bosoms
linked
by
a
blue
chain
palm
fronds
on
the
throat
stars
on
the
brow
and
chin
and
bands
round
the
wrists
and
ankles
these
disfigurements
and
large
gold
or
silver
filigree
buttons
placed
outside
one
nostril
by
means
of
a
wire
passed
through
it
worn
by
married
women
are
much
admired
when
these
women
sell
country
produce
in
the
markets
they
cover
their
heads
with
the
ordinary
the
streets
are
narrow
and
the
walls
which
are
built
of
bricks
are
high
windows
to
the
streets
are
common
and
the
oriel
windows
with
their
warm
brown
lattices
projecting
over
the
roadways
at
irregular
heights
are
strikingly
picturesque
not
less
so
are
latticework
galleries
which
are
often
thrown
across
the
street
to
connect
the
two
houses
of
wealthy
residents
and
the
with
oriel
windows
which
likewise
bridge
the
roadways
solid
doorways
with
and
doors
give
an
impression
of
security
and
suggest
comfort
and
to
some
extent
home
life
and
sprays
of
orange
trees
hanging
over
walls
and
fronds
of
date
palms
give
an
aspect
of
pleasantness
to
the
courtyards
the
best
parts
of
the
city
where
the
great
bazars
large
and
most
of
the
mosques
are
is
surrounded
by
a
labyrinth
of
alleys
fringing
off
into
streets
growing
meaner
till
they
cease
altogether
among
open
spaces
given
up
to
holes
heaps
rubbish
the
slaughter
of
animals
and
in
some
favoured
spots
to
the
production
of
vegetables
then
come
the
walls
which
are
of
bricks
and
have
towers
intended
for
guns
at
intervals
the
wastes
within
the
walls
have
every
element
of
decay
and
meanness
the
wastes
without
where
the
desert
sands
sweep
up
to
the
very
foot
of
the
fortifications
have
many
elements
of
grandeur
baghdad
is
altogether
built
of
bricks
there
are
about
kilns
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
jews
and
christians
in
the
wastes
outside
the
city
but
the
demand
exceeds
the
supply
not
for
building
only
but
for
the
perpetual
patchings
which
houses
paths
and
walls
are
always
requiring
owing
to
the
absorption
of
moisture
in
the
winter
bricks
at
the
kilns
sell
for
per
thousand
twelve
inches
square
and
per
thousand
seven
inches
square
they
are
carried
from
the
kilns
on
donkeys
small
beasts
each
taking
ten
large
or
small
bricks
unskilled
labour
is
abundant
men
can
be
engaged
at
a
day
and
boys
for
this
afternoon
in
the
glory
of
a
sunset
which
reddened
the
yellow
waste
up
to
the
distant
horizon
a
caravan
of
mules
mostly
in
single
file
approached
the
city
each
carried
two
or
four
white
bales
slung
on
his
sides
or
two
or
more
long
boxes
consisting
of
planks
roped
rather
than
nailed
together
this
is
the
fashion
in
which
thousands
of
persian
moslems
shiahs
or
sectaries
have
been
conveyed
for
ages
for
final
burial
at
kerbela
the
holiest
place
of
the
shiahs
an
easy
journey
from
baghdad
where
rest
the
ashes
of
ali
regarded
as
scarcely
second
to
mohammed
and
of
houssein
and
hassan
his
sons
whose
martyrdom
is
annually
commemorated
by
a
passion
play
which
is
acted
in
every
town
and
village
in
persia
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
kerbela
or
to
rest
finally
in
its
holy
dust
or
both
constitutes
the
ambition
of
every
shiah
the
sunnis
or
orthodox
who
hate
the
shiahs
are
so
far
kept
in
check
that
these
doleful
caravans
are
not
exposed
to
any
worse
molestation
than
the
shouts
and
ridicule
of
street
arabs
the
mode
of
carrying
the
dead
is
not
reverent
the
who
contract
for
the
removal
hurry
the
bodies
along
as
goods
and
pile
them
in
the
yards
of
the
caravanserais
at
night
and
the
mournful
journey
is
performed
oftener
than
not
without
the
presence
of
relations
each
body
being
ticketed
with
the
name
once
borne
by
its
owner
some
have
been
exhumed
and
are
merely
skeletons
others
are
in
various
stages
of
decomposition
and
some
are
of
the
newly
dead
outside
the
walls
predatory
arabs
render
the
roads
unsafe
for
solitary
travellers
and
at
times
for
feeble
caravans
but
things
in
this
respect
are
better
than
they
were
visits
to
the
armenian
and
chald√¶an
churches
to
the
mosque
of
abdel
kader
with
its
courts
thronged
by
afghan
pilgrims
and
to
the
jewish
quarter
have
been
very
interesting
there
are
said
to
be
jews
here
and
while
a
large
proportion
of
them
are
in
poverty
on
the
whole
they
are
an
influential
nationality
and
some
of
them
are
very
rich
through
the
liberality
of
sir
albert
sassoon
a
jewish
high
school
has
been
opened
where
an
admirable
education
is
given
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
it
and
with
the
director
who
speaks
french
fluently
and
with
the
proficiency
in
french
of
the
elder
students
he
describes
their
earnestness
and
energetic
application
as
being
most
remarkable
the
french
carmelite
monks
have
a
large
solid
mission
church
or
cathedral
with
a
fine
peal
of
bells
and
a
very
prosperous
school
attached
in
which
are
boys
belonging
to
all
the
many
creeds
professed
in
baghdad
the
sisters
of
joseph
have
a
school
for
girls
which
turkish
children
are
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
the
sisters
find
a
remarkable
unhandiness
among
the
women
few
if
any
among
them
have
any
idea
of
cutting
out
or
repairing
and
rich
and
poor
are
equally
incapable
of
employing
their
fingers
usefully
the
people
here
are
so
used
to
the
sight
of
europeans
that
it
is
quite
easy
for
foreign
ladies
to
walk
in
this
quarter
only
attended
by
a
servant
and
i
have
accompanied
sutton
on
visits
to
several
armenian
houses
the
armenians
are
in
many
cases
wealthy
as
their
and
houses
testify
the
christian
population
is
estimated
at
and
its
wealth
and
energy
give
it
greater
importance
than
its
numbers
warrant
one
of
the
houses
which
we
visited
was
truly
beautiful
and
in
very
good
taste
the
solidity
of
the
stone
and
brickwork
the
finish
of
the
wood
and
the
beauty
of
the
designs
and
their
execution
in
hammered
iron
being
quite
remarkable
the
lofty
roofs
and
cornices
are
elaborately
worked
in
plaster
and
this
is
completely
concealed
by
hundreds
or
thousands
of
mirrors
set
so
as
to
resemble
facets
so
that
roof
and
cornices
flash
like
diamonds
this
is
a
persian
style
of
decoration
and
is
extremely
effective
in
large
handsome
rooms
superb
carpets
and
divans
and
tea
tables
inlaid
with
furnish
the
reception
and
smoking
rooms
and
the
bedrooms
and
nurseries
over
which
we
were
taken
were
simply
arranged
with
french
bedsteads
and
curtains
of
nottingham
mosquito
net
as
in
other
eastern
houses
there
were
no
traces
of
occupation
no
morning
room
or
den
sacred
to
litter
neither
was
there
anything
to
look
at
the
opposite
extreme
from
our
overloaded
or
any
library
cigarettes
and
black
coffee
in
minute
porcelain
cups
in
gold
filigree
receptacles
were
presented
on
each
occasion
and
the
kind
and
courteous
intention
was
very
pleasing
the
visits
which
i
paid
with
sutton
were
very
different
he
has
worked
as
a
medical
missionary
here
for
some
years
and
his
unaffected
benevolence
and
quiet
attention
to
all
suffering
persons
without
distinction
of
race
or
creed
and
his
recent
extraordinary
labours
by
night
and
day
among
the
people
have
won
for
him
general
esteem
and
confidence
and
he
is
even
allowed
to
enter
moslem
houses
and
prescribe
for
the
women
in
some
cases
the
dispensary
in
which
there
is
not
half
enough
accommodation
is
very
largely
attended
by
people
of
all
creeds
and
even
moslem
women
though
exclusively
of
the
poorer
classes
avail
themselves
of
it
yesterday
when
i
was
there
the
comfortable
seats
of
the
cheerful
matted
were
all
occupied
by
armenian
and
chald√¶an
women
unveiled
and
speaking
quite
freely
to
sutton
while
a
few
moslem
women
masked
rather
than
veiled
and
enveloped
in
black
sheets
cowered
on
the
floor
and
scarcely
let
their
voices
be
heard
even
in
a
tremulous
whisper
i
am
always
sorry
to
see
any
encroachment
made
by
christian
teachers
on
national
customs
where
they
are
not
contrary
to
morality
and
willingly
leave
to
eastern
women
the
and
the
veil
but
still
there
is
a
wholesomeness
about
the
unveiled
rosy
comely
frank
faces
of
these
christian
women
but
and
it
is
a
decided
but
though
the
women
were
comely
and
though
some
of
the
armenian
girls
are
beautiful
every
one
has
one
or
more
flattish
depressions
on
her
face
scars
in
fact
the
size
of
a
large
date
stone
nearly
the
whole
population
is
thus
disfigured
so
universal
is
it
among
the
armenian
girls
that
so
far
from
being
regarded
as
a
blemish
it
is
viewed
as
a
token
of
good
health
and
it
is
said
that
a
young
man
would
hesitate
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
a
girl
in
marriage
if
she
had
not
a
date
mark
on
her
face
these
date
boils
or
baghdad
boils
as
they
are
sometimes
called
are
not
slow
in
attacking
european
strangers
and
few
if
any
escape
during
their
residence
here
as
no
cause
can
reasonably
be
assigned
for
them
so
no
cure
has
been
found
various
remedies
including
cauterisation
have
been
tried
but
without
success
and
it
is
now
thought
wisest
to
do
nothing
more
than
keep
them
dry
and
clean
and
let
them
run
their
natural
course
which
lasts
about
a
year
happily
they
are
not
so
painful
as
ordinary
boils
the
malady
appears
at
first
as
a
white
point
not
larger
than
a
pin
head
and
remains
thus
for
about
three
months
then
the
flesh
swells
becomes
red
and
hard
and
suppurates
and
underneath
a
rough
crust
which
is
formed
is
corroded
and
eaten
away
as
by
vitriol
on
some
strangers
the
fatal
point
appears
within
a
few
days
of
their
arrival
in
two
years
in
the
east
i
have
not
seen
any
european
welcomed
so
cordially
as
sutton
into
moslem
homes
the
exhibiting
in
quiet
continuance
in
the
legible
and
higher
fruits
of
christianity
while
refraining
from
harsh
and
irreverent
onslaughts
on
the
creeds
of
those
whose
sufferings
he
mitigates
is
everywhere
blessed
to
my
thinking
no
one
follows
in
the
master
footprints
so
closely
as
the
medical
missionary
and
on
no
agency
for
alleviating
human
suffering
can
one
look
with
more
unqualified
satisfaction
the
medical
mission
is
the
outcome
of
the
living
teachings
of
our
faith
i
have
now
visited
such
missions
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
never
saw
one
which
was
not
healing
helping
blessing
softening
prejudice
diminishing
suffering
making
an
end
of
many
of
the
cruelties
which
proceed
from
ignorance
restoring
sight
to
the
blind
limbs
to
the
crippled
health
to
the
sick
telling
in
every
work
of
love
and
of
consecrated
skill
of
the
infinite
compassion
of
him
who
came
not
to
destroy
men
lives
but
to
save
them
in
one
house
sutton
was
welcome
because
he
had
saved
a
life
in
another
because
a
blind
youth
had
received
his
sight
and
so
on
among
our
visits
was
one
to
a
poor
moslem
family
in
a
very
poor
quarter
no
matter
how
poor
the
people
are
their
rooms
stand
back
from
the
street
and
open
on
yards
more
or
less
mean
it
is
a
misnomer
to
call
this
dwelling
a
house
or
to
write
that
it
for
it
is
merely
an
arched
recess
which
can
never
be
shut
in
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
an
uneven
earthen
floor
there
was
a
fire
of
tamarisk
root
and
animal
fuel
giving
off
a
stinging
smoke
on
this
the
broken
wheat
porridge
for
supper
was
being
cooked
in
a
copper
pot
supported
on
three
rusty
an
earthenware
basin
a
wooden
spoon
a
long
knife
a
of
water
a
mallet
a
long
which
had
served
as
the
bed
for
the
wife
when
she
was
ill
some
ugly
hens
a
clay
jar
full
of
grain
two
heaps
of
brick
rubbish
and
some
wadded
quilts
which
had
taken
on
the
prevailing
colour
were
the
plenishings
of
the
arch
poverty
brings
one
blessing
in
turkey
the
poor
man
is
of
necessity
a
monogamist
wretched
though
the
place
was
it
had
the
air
of
home
and
the
smoky
hole
in
the
floor
was
a
fireside
the
wife
was
unveiled
and
joined
in
the
conversation
the
husband
was
helping
her
to
cook
the
supper
and
the
children
were
sitting
round
or
scrambling
over
their
parents
knees
all
looked
as
happy
as
people
in
their
class
anywhere
it
is
good
to
have
ocular
demonstration
that
such
homes
exist
in
turkey
god
be
thanked
for
them
the
man
a
fine
turk
welcomed
sutton
jovially
he
had
saved
the
wife
life
and
was
received
as
their
best
friend
who
indeed
but
the
medical
missionary
would
care
for
such
as
them
and
give
them
of
his
skill
without
money
and
without
price
the
hearty
laugh
of
this
turk
was
good
to
hear
his
wife
smiled
cordially
and
the
boys
laughed
like
their
father
the
eldest
a
nice
bright
fellow
of
nine
taught
in
the
mosque
school
was
proud
to
show
how
well
he
could
read
arabic
and
read
part
of
a
chapter
from
john
gospel
his
parents
looking
on
with
wonder
and
admiration
among
the
christian
families
we
called
on
were
those
of
the
dispenser
and
catechist
people
with
very
small
salaries
but
comfortable
homes
these
families
were
living
in
a
house
furnished
like
those
of
the
rich
armenians
but
on
a
very
simple
scale
the
floor
and
da√Øs
covered
with
persian
carpets
the
divan
with
turkish
woollen
stuff
and
there
were
in
addition
a
chair
or
two
and
silk
cushions
on
the
floor
in
one
room
there
were
an
intelligent
elderly
woman
a
beautiful
girl
of
seventeen
married
a
few
days
ago
and
wearing
her
bridal
ornaments
with
her
husband
another
man
and
his
wife
and
two
bright
boys
who
spoke
six
languages
all
had
date
marks
on
their
faces
after
a
year
among
moslems
and
hindus
it
was
startling
to
find
men
and
women
sitting
together
the
women
unveiled
and
taking
their
share
in
the
conversation
merrily
and
happily
even
the
young
bride
took
the
initiative
in
talking
to
sutton
of
course
the
christian
women
cover
their
faces
in
the
streets
but
the
covering
is
of
different
material
and
arrangement
and
is
really
magnificent
being
of
very
rich
stiff
corded
silk
usually
black
heliotrope
or
dark
blue
with
a
contrasting
colour
woven
in
deep
vandykes
upon
a
white
ground
as
a
border
the
silk
is
superb
really
capable
of
standing
on
end
with
richness
such
a
sheet
costs
about
the
ambition
of
every
woman
is
to
possess
one
and
to
gratify
it
she
even
denies
herself
in
the
necessaries
of
life
the
upper
classes
of
both
moslem
and
christian
women
are
rarely
seen
on
foot
in
the
streets
except
on
certain
days
as
when
they
visit
the
churches
and
the
mosques
and
nevertheless
they
go
about
a
great
deal
to
visit
each
other
riding
on
white
asses
which
are
also
used
by
and
rich
elderly
merchants
all
asses
have
their
nostrils
slit
to
improve
their
wind
a
good
white
ass
of
long
pedigree
over
thirteen
hands
high
costs
as
much
as
as
they
are
groomed
till
they
look
as
white
as
snow
and
are
caparisoned
with
red
leather
trappings
embroidered
with
gold
thread
and
silks
and
as
a
rider
on
a
white
ass
is
usually
preceded
by
runners
who
shout
and
brandish
sticks
to
clear
the
way
this
animal
always
suggests
position
or
at
least
wealth
women
of
the
upper
classes
mounted
on
these
asses
usually
go
to
pay
afternoon
visits
in
companies
with
mounted
eunuchs
and
attendants
and
men
to
clear
the
way
they
ride
astride
with
short
stirrups
but
the
rider
is
represented
only
by
a
shapeless
blue
bundle
out
of
which
protrude
two
yellow
boots
blacks
of
the
purest
negro
type
frequently
attend
on
women
and
indeed
consequence
is
shown
by
the
possession
of
a
number
of
them
of
the
georgian
and
circassian
of
the
harams
a
single
lustrous
eye
with
its
brilliancy
enhanced
by
the
use
of
is
all
that
one
sees
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
are
the
arab
women
and
the
unsecluded
women
of
the
lower
orders
generally
who
are
of
necessity
drudges
and
are
old
hags
before
they
are
twenty
except
in
the
few
cases
in
which
they
do
not
become
mothers
when
the
good
looks
which
many
of
them
possess
in
extreme
youth
last
a
little
longer
if
memories
of
baghdad
women
were
only
of
those
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
they
would
be
of
leathery
wrinkled
faces
prematurely
old
figures
which
have
lost
all
shape
and
hands
crinkled
and
deformed
by
toil
baghdad
is
busy
and
noisy
with
traffic
great
quantities
of
british
goods
pass
through
it
to
persia
avoiding
by
doing
so
the
horrible
rock
ladders
between
bushire
and
isfahan
the
water
transit
from
england
and
india
only
involving
the
inconvenience
of
transhipment
at
basrah
makes
baghdad
practically
into
a
seaport
with
something
of
the
bustle
and
vivacity
of
a
seaport
and
caravans
numbering
from
to
laden
mules
are
employed
in
the
carriage
of
goods
to
and
from
the
persian
cities
a
duty
of
one
per
cent
is
levied
on
goods
in
transit
to
persia
the
trade
of
baghdad
is
not
to
be
despised
the
principal
articles
which
were
imported
from
europe
amounted
in
to
a
value
of
and
from
india
to
while
the
exports
from
baghdad
to
europe
and
america
were
valued
in
the
same
year
at
and
to
india
by
british
india
company
steamers
only
at
in
looking
through
the
consular
list
of
exports
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
cwts
of
gum
of
the
value
of
were
exported
in
neither
the
indian
postage
stamps
nor
ours
should
suffer
from
the
partial
failure
of
the
soudan
supply
liquorice
roots
to
the
value
of
were
exported
in
almost
solely
to
america
to
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
quid
tobacco
and
fancy
drinks
the
gall
nuts
which
grow
in
profusion
on
the
dwarf
oaks
which
cover
many
hillsides
were
exported
last
year
to
the
value
of
to
be
used
chiefly
in
the
production
of
ink
so
closely
is
commerce
binding
countries
one
to
the
other
two
english
firms
have
concessions
for
pressing
wool
and
making
it
into
bales
suitable
for
shipment
there
are
five
principal
english
firms
here
three
french
and
six
turkish
not
including
the
small
fry
there
are
five
foreign
consulates
the
carriage
of
goods
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
persian
and
turkish
industries
and
the
breeding
of
mules
and
the
manufacture
of
caravan
equipments
give
extensive
employment
but
one
shudders
to
think
of
the
amount
of
suffering
involved
in
sore
backs
and
wounds
and
of
exhausted
and
animals
lying
down
forlornly
to
die
having
their
eyes
picked
out
before
death
the
mercury
was
at
at
this
morning
fuel
is
scarce
and
dear
some
of
the
rooms
are
without
fireplaces
and
these
good
people
study
write
and
work
cheerfully
in
this
temperature
in
open
rooms
untouched
by
the
early
sun
the
preparations
for
journey
are
nearly
complete
three
mules
have
been
engaged
for
the
baggage
one
for
hadji
and
a
saddle
mule
for
myself
stores
a
revolver
and
a
or
brazier
have
been
bought
a
permit
to
travel
has
been
obtained
and
my
hosts
with
the
most
thoughtful
kindness
have
facilitated
all
the
arrangements
i
have
bought
two
mule
which
are
tall
narrow
leather
trunks
on
strong
iron
frames
with
stout
straps
to
buckle
over
the
top
of
the
pack
saddle
on
the
whole
i
find
that
it
is
best
to
adopt
as
far
as
possible
the
travelling
equipments
of
the
country
in
which
one
travels
the
muleteers
and
servants
understand
them
better
and
if
any
thing
goes
wrong
or
wears
out
it
can
be
repaired
or
replaced
i
have
given
away
nearly
all
the
things
i
brought
from
england
and
have
reduced
my
camp
furniture
to
a
folding
bed
and
a
chair
i
shall
start
with
three
novelties
a
a
saddle
mule
and
an
untried
saddle
it
is
expected
that
the
journey
will
be
a
very
severe
one
owing
to
the
exceptionally
heavy
snowfall
reported
from
the
zagros
mountains
and
the
persian
plateau
the
persian
post
has
arrived
several
days
late
footnotes
i
heard
that
the
shah
had
prohibited
this
dead
march
to
kerbela
on
account
of
the
many
risks
to
the
public
health
involved
in
it
but
nearly
a
year
later
in
persian
kurdistan
i
met
besides
thousands
of
living
pilgrims
a
large
caravan
of
the
dead
six
months
later
a
bakhtiari
chief
a
bigoted
moslem
said
to
me
at
the
conclusion
of
an
earnest
plea
for
european
medical
advice
yes
jesus
was
a
great
prophet
us
a
hak
m
in
his
and
doubtless
the
nearer
that
likeness
is
the
greater
is
the
success
the
entire
trade
of
baghdad
is
estimated
at
about
of
which
the
persian
transit
trade
is
nearly
a
quarter
the
persian
imports
and
exports
through
baghdad
are
classified
thus
manufactured
goods
including
manchester
piece
goods
and
continental
woollens
and
cottons
to
loads
indian
manufactures
loads
loaf
sugar
chiefly
from
marseilles
loads
drugs
pepper
coffee
tea
other
sugars
indigo
cochineal
copper
and
spelter
loads
the
persian
exports
for
despatch
by
sea
include
wool
opium
cotton
carpets
gum
and
dried
fruits
and
for
local
consumption
among
others
tobacco
clarified
butter
and
dried
and
fresh
fruits
with
a
probable
bulk
of
from
to
loads
i
had
given
up
the
idea
of
travelling
in
persia
and
was
preparing
to
leave
india
for
england
when
an
officer
with
whom
i
was
then
unacquainted
and
who
was
about
to
proceed
to
tihran
on
business
kindly
offered
me
his
escort
the
journey
turned
out
one
of
extreme
hardship
and
difficulty
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
kindness
and
efficient
help
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
have
accomplished
it
letter
iii
yakobiyeh
asiatic
turkey
whether
for
well
or
ill
the
journey
to
tihran
is
begun
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
had
grown
so
nervous
about
its
untried
elements
and
about
the
possibilities
of
the
next
two
months
that
a
very
small
thing
would
have
made
me
give
it
up
at
the
last
moment
but
now
that
i
am
fairly
embarked
upon
it
in
splendid
weather
the
spirit
of
travel
has
returned
much
remained
for
the
last
morning
debts
to
be
paid
in
complicated
money
for
indian
turkish
and
persian
coins
are
all
current
here
english
circular
notes
to
be
turned
into
difficult
coin
and
the
usual
row
with
the
muleteers
to
be
endured
this
disagreeable
farce
attends
nearly
all
departures
in
the
east
and
i
never
feel
the
comfortable
assurance
that
it
means
nothing
the
men
weighed
my
baggage
which
was
considerably
under
weight
the
day
before
but
yesterday
three
or
four
of
them
came
into
the
courtyard
shouting
in
arabic
at
the
top
of
their
loud
harsh
voices
that
they
would
not
carry
the
loads
hadji
roared
at
them
loading
his
revolver
all
the
time
calling
them
sons
of
burnt
fathers
and
other
choice
names
bruce
and
sutton
reasoned
with
them
from
the
balcony
when
in
the
very
height
of
the
row
they
suddenly
shouldered
the
loads
and
went
off
with
them
two
hours
later
the
delightful
hospitalities
of
and
sutton
were
left
behind
and
the
farewell
to
the
group
in
the
courtyard
of
the
mission
house
is
a
long
farewell
to
civilisation
rumours
of
difficulties
have
been
rife
and
among
the
various
dismal
prophecies
the
one
oftenest
repeated
is
that
we
shall
be
entangled
in
the
snows
of
the
zagros
mountains
but
the
journey
began
propitiously
among
oranges
and
palms
bright
sunshine
and
warm
good
wishes
my
mule
turns
out
a
fine
spirited
animal
and
the
untried
saddle
suits
me
my
marching
equipment
consists
of
two
large
holsters
with
a
revolver
and
apparatus
in
one
and
a
bottle
of
milk
and
dates
in
the
other
an
afghan
sheepskin
coat
is
strapped
to
the
front
of
the
saddle
and
a
blanket
and
stout
mackintosh
behind
i
wear
a
cork
a
gray
mask
instead
of
a
veil
an
american
mountain
dress
with
a
warm
jacket
over
it
and
tan
boots
scarcely
the
worse
for
a
year
of
himalayan
travel
hadji
is
dressed
like
a
wild
ishmaelite
captain
dougherty
of
and
his
chief
engineer
piloted
us
through
the
narrow
alleys
and
thronged
bazars
a
or
gendarme
with
a
rifle
across
his
and
a
sheathed
sabre
in
his
hand
shouting
at
the
donkey
boys
and
clearing
the
crowd
to
right
and
left
through
the
twilight
of
the
bazars
where
chance
rays
of
sunshine
fell
on
warm
colouring
gay
merchandise
and
picturesque
crowds
along
narrow
alleys
overhung
by
brown
lattice
windows
out
under
the
glorious
blue
of
heaven
among
ruins
and
graves
through
the
northern
gateway
and
then
there
was
an
abrupt
exchange
of
the
roar
and
limitations
of
the
city
of
the
caliphs
for
the
silence
of
the
desert
and
the
brown
sweep
of
a
limitless
horizon
a
walled
eastern
city
has
no
suburbs
it
is
a
literal
step
from
a
crowded
town
to
absolute
solitude
the
contrast
is
specially
emphasised
at
baghdad
where
the
transition
is
made
from
a
great
commercial
city
with
a
crowded
waterway
to
an
uninhabited
plain
in
the
nudity
of
a
last
look
at
gleaming
domes
coloured
minarets
and
massive
mausoleums
rising
out
of
an
environment
of
palms
and
orange
groves
at
the
brick
walls
and
towers
of
the
city
at
the
great
gate
to
which
lines
of
caravans
were
converging
from
every
quarter
a
farewell
to
the
kindly
pilots
and
the
journey
began
in
earnest
the
desert
sweeps
up
to
the
walls
of
baghdad
but
it
is
a
misnomer
to
call
the
vast
level
of
rich
stoneless
alluvial
soil
a
desert
it
is
a
dead
flat
of
uninhabited
earth
orange
colocynth
balls
a
little
wormwood
and
some
alkaline
plants
which
camels
eat
being
its
chief
products
after
the
inundations
reedy
grass
grows
in
the
hollows
it
is
a
waste
rather
than
a
desert
and
was
once
a
populous
plain
and
the
rich
soil
only
needs
irrigation
to
make
it
blossom
as
the
rose
traces
of
the
splendid
irrigation
system
under
which
it
was
once
a
garden
abound
along
the
route
the
and
afternoon
were
as
glorious
as
an
unclouded
sky
a
warm
sun
and
a
fresh
keen
air
could
make
them
the
desert
freedom
was
all
around
and
the
nameless
charm
of
a
nomadic
life
the
naked
plain
which
stretched
to
the
horizon
was
broken
only
by
the
brown
tents
of
arabs
mixed
up
with
brown
patches
of
migrating
flocks
strings
of
brown
camels
straggling
caravans
and
companies
of
arab
horsemen
heavily
armed
an
expanse
of
dried
mud
the
mirage
continually
seen
a
cloudless
sky
and
a
brilliant
sun
this
was
all
i
felt
better
at
once
in
the
pure
exhilarating
desert
air
and
nervousness
about
the
journey
was
left
behind
i
even
indulged
in
a
gallop
and
except
for
her
impetuosity
which
carried
me
into
the
middle
of
a
caravan
and
turning
round
a
few
times
the
mule
behaved
so
irreproachably
that
i
forgot
the
potential
possibilities
of
evil
still
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
ever
be
that
perfect
correspondence
of
will
between
a
mule
and
his
rider
that
there
is
between
a
horse
and
his
rider
the
mirage
was
almost
continual
and
grossly
deceptive
fair
blue
lakes
appeared
with
palms
and
towers
mirrored
on
their
glassy
surfaces
giving
place
to
snowy
ranges
with
bright
waters
at
their
feet
fringed
by
tall
trees
changing
into
stately
processions
all
so
absolutely
real
that
the
real
often
seemed
the
delusion
these
deceptions
continued
for
several
hours
were
humiliating
and
exasperating
towards
evening
the
shams
disappeared
the
waste
purpled
as
the
sun
sank
and
after
riding
fifteen
miles
we
halted
near
the
mud
village
of
orta
khan
a
place
with
brackish
water
and
no
supplies
but
a
little
brackish
sheep
milk
the
caravanserai
was
abominable
and
we
rode
on
to
a
fine
gravelly
but
the
headman
and
some
of
the
villagers
came
out
and
would
not
hear
of
our
pitching
the
tents
where
we
should
be
the
prey
of
predatory
hordes
strong
enough
they
said
to
overpower
an
officer
two
and
three
orderlies
being
unwilling
to
get
them
into
trouble
we
accepted
a
horrible
a
garden
trenched
for
dates
and
lately
irrigated
as
damp
and
clayey
as
it
could
be
my
will
not
be
dry
again
this
winter
the
mules
could
not
get
in
the
baggage
was
unloaded
at
some
distance
and
was
all
mixed
up
and
hadji
showed
himself
incapable
my
tent
fell
twice
remained
precarious
and
the
were
never
pegged
down
at
all
the
was
trampled
into
the
mud
by
clayey
feet
baggage
had
to
be
disentangled
and
unpacked
after
dark
and
the
confusion
apt
to
prevail
on
the
first
night
of
a
march
was
something
terrible
it
opened
my
eyes
to
the
thorough
inefficiency
of
hadji
who
was
so
dazed
with
opium
this
morning
that
he
stood
about
in
a
dream
ejaculating
allah
when
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
bestir
himself
leaving
me
to
do
all
the
packing
groaning
as
he
took
up
the
tent
pegs
and
putting
on
the
mule
bridle
with
the
bit
hanging
under
her
chin
the
night
was
very
damp
not
quite
frosty
and
in
the
dim
morning
the
tent
and
its
contents
were
wet
tea
at
seven
with
baghdad
rusks
with
a
distinctly
native
taste
two
hours
spent
in
standing
about
on
the
damp
clayey
ground
till
my
feet
were
numb
while
the
men
most
of
whom
were
complaining
of
rheumatism
stumbled
through
their
new
work
and
then
five
hours
of
wastes
enlivened
by
caravans
of
camels
mules
horses
or
asses
and
sometimes
of
all
mixed
with
their
wild
armed
drivers
the
leader
of
each
caravan
carries
a
bell
under
his
throat
suspended
from
a
red
leather
band
stitched
with
cowries
another
at
his
chest
and
very
large
ones
often
inches
long
by
ten
in
diameter
hanging
from
each
pack
every
other
animal
of
the
caravan
has
smaller
bells
and
the
tones
which
are
often
most
musical
reach
from
the
deep
note
of
a
church
bell
up
to
the
frivolous
jingle
of
sleigh
bells
jingle
often
becomes
jangle
when
several
caravans
are
together
the
muleteers
spend
large
sums
on
the
bells
and
other
decorations
among
the
loads
we
met
or
overtook
were
paraffin
oranges
pomegranates
carpets
cotton
goods
melons
grain
and
chopped
straw
the
waste
is
covered
with
tracks
and
a
guide
is
absolutely
necessary
the
day
has
been
still
and
very
gloomy
with
flakes
of
snow
falling
at
times
the
passing
over
rich
soil
once
cultivated
and
populous
now
abandoned
to
the
antelope
and
partridge
is
most
melancholy
the
remains
of
canals
and
which
in
former
days
brought
the
waters
of
the
tigris
and
the
diyalah
into
the
fields
of
the
great
population
of
these
vast
levels
of
chald√¶a
and
mesopotamia
are
everywhere
and
at
times
create
difficulties
on
the
road
by
road
is
simply
meant
a
track
of
greater
or
less
width
trodden
on
the
soil
by
the
passage
of
caravans
for
ages
on
these
two
marches
not
a
stone
has
been
seen
which
could
strike
a
ploughshare
great
ancient
canals
with
their
banks
in
ruins
and
their
deep
beds
choked
up
and
useless
have
been
a
mournful
feature
of
rather
a
dismal
day
journey
we
crossed
the
bed
of
the
once
magnificent
nahrwan
canal
the
finest
of
the
ancient
irrigation
works
to
the
east
of
the
tigris
still
in
many
places
from
to
forty
feet
deep
and
from
to
feet
in
breadth
for
many
miles
the
only
permanent
village
is
a
collection
of
miserable
mud
hovels
round
a
forlorn
caravanserai
in
which
travellers
may
find
a
wretched
refuge
from
the
vicissitudes
of
weather
there
is
a
remarkable
lack
of
shelter
and
provender
considering
that
this
is
not
only
one
of
the
busiest
of
caravan
routes
but
is
enormously
frequented
by
shiah
pilgrims
on
their
way
from
persia
to
the
shrines
of
kerbela
after
crossing
the
nahrwan
canal
the
road
keeps
near
the
right
bank
of
the
diyalah
a
fine
stream
which
for
a
considerable
distance
runs
parallel
with
the
tigris
at
a
distance
of
from
ten
to
thirty
miles
from
it
and
falls
into
it
below
baghdad
and
and
villages
with
groves
of
palms
break
the
line
of
the
horizon
while
on
the
left
bank
for
fully
two
miles
are
contiguous
groves
of
dates
and
pomegranates
these
groves
are
walled
and
among
them
this
and
ruinous
town
is
situated
miserably
shrunk
from
its
former
proportions
we
entered
yakobiyeh
after
crossing
the
diyalah
by
a
pontoon
bridge
of
twelve
boats
and
found
one
good
house
with
projecting
lattice
windows
and
a
large
entrance
over
which
the
head
and
ears
of
a
hare
were
nailed
narrow
filthy
lanes
a
covered
bazar
very
dark
and
ruinous
but
fairly
well
supplied
an
archway
and
within
it
this
caravanserai
in
which
the
baggage
must
be
waited
for
for
two
hours
this
first
experience
of
a
turkish
inn
is
striking
there
is
a
large
square
yard
heaped
with
dirt
and
rubbish
round
which
are
stables
and
some
dark
ruinous
rooms
a
broken
stair
leads
to
a
flat
mud
roof
on
which
are
some
narrow
stalls
they
can
not
be
called
with
rude
doors
fastening
only
from
the
outside
for
windows
small
round
holes
mostly
stuffed
with
straw
near
the
roof
for
floors
sodden
earth
for
fireplaces
holes
in
the
same
the
walls
slimy
and
unplastered
the
corners
full
of
ages
of
dusty
cobwebs
both
the
walls
and
the
rafters
of
the
roof
black
with
ages
of
smoke
and
beetles
and
other
abominations
hurry
into
crannies
when
the
doors
are
opened
to
emerge
as
soon
as
they
are
shut
a
small
hole
in
the
wall
outside
each
stall
serves
for
cooking
the
habits
of
the
people
are
repulsive
foul
odours
are
only
hybernating
and
so
mercifully
are
the
vermin
while
waiting
for
the
furniture
which
is
to
make
my
unfurnished
apartment
habitable
i
write
sitting
on
my
camp
stool
with
its
back
against
the
wall
wrapped
up
in
a
a
heap
of
saddles
swords
holsters
and
gear
keeping
the
wind
from
my
feet
the
afghan
orderly
smokes
at
the
top
of
the
stair
plumes
of
palms
and
ridges
of
snowy
hills
appear
over
the
battlements
of
the
roof
a
snow
wind
blows
keenly
my
fingers
are
nearly
numb
and
i
am
generally
stiff
and
aching
but
so
much
better
that
discomforts
are
only
an
amusement
snow
is
said
to
be
impending
i
have
lunched
frugally
on
sheep
milk
and
dates
and
feel
everything
but
my
present
surroundings
to
be
very
far
off
and
as
if
i
had
lived
the
desert
life
and
had
heard
the
chimes
of
the
great
caravans
and
had
seen
the
wild
desert
riders
and
the
sun
sinking
below
the
level
line
of
the
desert
horizon
for
two
months
instead
of
two
days
yakobiyeh
is
said
to
have
houses
it
has
some
small
mosques
and
several
caravanserais
of
which
this
is
the
best
it
was
once
a
flourishing
place
but
repeated
ravages
of
the
plague
and
chronic
official
extortions
have
reduced
it
to
decay
nevertheless
it
grows
grain
enough
for
its
own
needs
on
poorly
irrigated
soil
and
in
its
immense
gardens
apples
pears
apricots
walnuts
and
mulberries
flourish
alongside
of
the
orange
and
palm
robat
it
was
not
very
cold
at
yakobiyeh
at
home
few
people
would
be
able
to
sit
in
a
fireless
den
with
the
door
open
on
a
january
night
but
fireless
though
it
was
my
slender
camp
equipage
gave
it
a
look
of
comfort
and
though
rats
or
mice
ate
a
bag
of
rusks
during
the
night
and
ran
over
my
bed
there
were
no
other
annoyances
hadji
grows
more
dazed
and
possibly
more
unwilling
every
day
as
he
sees
his
vista
of
perquisites
growing
more
limited
and
to
get
off
even
at
nine
i
have
to
do
the
heavy
as
well
as
the
light
packing
myself
there
was
a
great
row
arising
out
of
an
alleged
delinquency
of
the
concerning
payment
when
we
left
yakobiyeh
the
following
morning
the
owners
of
the
caravanserai
wanted
to
detain
us
and
the
archway
was
so
packed
with
a
shouting
gesticulating
scowling
and
not
kindly
crowd
mostly
armed
that
it
was
not
easy
for
me
to
mount
the
hire
of
mules
always
includes
their
fodder
and
the
keep
of
the
men
but
in
the
first
day
or
two
the
latter
usually
attempt
to
break
their
bargain
and
compel
their
employer
to
provide
for
them
so
long
as
arabic
is
spoken
hadji
acts
as
sole
interpreter
and
though
soldiers
and
were
left
with
him
he
was
scared
at
being
left
behind
with
the
baggage
the
people
stormed
and
threatened
at
the
top
of
their
voices
but
doubtless
it
was
not
so
bad
as
it
sounded
for
we
got
through
the
bazars
without
molestation
and
then
into
a
perplexing
system
of
ancient
whose
high
broken
banks
and
deep
waterless
beds
intersect
each
other
and
the
road
in
contrast
to
this
magnificent
irrigation
system
there
are
modern
about
a
foot
wide
taken
from
the
river
diyalah
which
small
as
they
are
turn
the
rich
deep
soil
into
a
fruitful
field
after
these
glimpses
of
a
prosperity
which
once
was
and
might
be
again
for
these
vast
alluvial
plains
which
extend
from
the
zagros
mountains
to
the
euphrates
and
up
to
the
syrian
desert
are
capable
with
irrigation
and
cultivation
of
becoming
the
granary
of
western
asia
the
road
emerges
on
a
level
and
somewhat
gravelly
waste
on
which
after
a
long
ride
we
were
overtaken
by
a
sent
by
the
persian
agent
in
yakobiyeh
to
say
that
the
baggage
and
servants
were
being
forcibly
detained
but
shortly
afterwards
with
a
good
glass
the
caravan
was
seen
emerging
from
the
town
the
country
was
nearly
as
featureless
as
on
the
preceding
day
and
on
the
whole
quite
barren
among
the
few
caravans
on
the
road
there
were
two
of
immense
value
the
loads
being
the
best
description
of
persian
carpets
there
were
a
few
families
on
asses
migrating
with
all
their
possessions
and
a
few
parties
of
arab
horsemen
picturesquely
and
very
fully
armed
but
no
dwellings
till
in
the
bright
afternoon
sunshine
on
the
dreariest
stretch
of
an
apparently
verdureless
waste
we
came
on
the
caravanserai
of
wiyjahea
a
gateway
with
a
room
above
it
a
square
court
with
high
walls
and
arched
recesses
all
round
for
goods
and
travellers
and
large
stables
a
row
of
reed
huts
another
of
arab
tents
and
a
hovel
opposite
the
gateway
where
a
man
with
two
guns
within
reach
sells
food
tobacco
and
hair
ropes
make
up
this
place
of
horror
for
indeed
the
only
water
is
a
brackish
reedy
pool
with
its
slime
well
stirred
by
the
feet
of
animals
and
every
man
hand
is
against
his
brother
we
proposed
to
pitch
my
tent
in
a
ruined
enclosure
but
the
headman
was
unwilling
and
when
it
was
suggested
that
it
should
be
placed
between
the
shop
and
the
caravanserai
he
said
that
before
sunset
all
the
predatory
arabs
for
ten
miles
round
would
hear
that
rich
foreigners
were
travelling
and
would
fall
upon
and
plunder
us
so
we
must
pitch
if
at
all
in
the
filthy
and
crowded
court
of
the
caravanserai
the
or
upper
room
was
too
insecure
for
me
and
had
no
privacy
as
the
fodder
was
kept
in
it
and
there
was
no
method
of
closing
the
doors
which
let
in
the
bitterly
cold
wind
we
arrived
at
and
long
before
sunset
a
number
of
caravans
came
in
and
the
courtyard
was
full
of
horses
mules
and
asses
when
they
halted
the
loads
were
taken
off
and
stacked
in
the
arched
recesses
next
the
great
padded
which
cover
nearly
the
whole
back
were
removed
revealing
in
most
cases
deep
sores
and
ulcers
then
the
animals
were
groomed
with
box
with
clatters
like
the
noise
of
a
inside
them
fifty
going
at
once
is
like
the
din
of
the
cicada
then
the
beasts
were
driven
in
batches
to
the
reedy
pool
and
came
flying
back
through
the
archway
some
fighting
others
playing
many
rolling
one
of
them
nearly
pulled
my
tent
over
by
rolling
among
the
tent
ropes
it
had
been
pitched
on
damp
and
filthy
ground
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
among
mules
horses
asses
dogs
and
the
roughest
of
rough
men
but
even
there
the
damp
inside
looked
like
home
after
this
brief
hilarity
the
which
serve
as
blankets
were
put
on
the
camels
were
made
to
lie
down
in
rows
most
of
the
mules
and
horses
were
tethered
in
the
great
stable
where
they
neighed
stamped
and
jangled
their
bells
all
night
and
others
were
picketed
in
the
yard
among
the
goats
and
donkeys
and
the
big
dogs
which
wandered
about
yelping
later
the
small
remaining
space
was
filled
up
with
sheep
it
was
just
possible
to
move
but
no
more
and
sheep
and
goats
were
even
packed
under
the
of
my
tent
the
muleteers
and
travellers
spread
their
bedding
in
the
recesses
lighted
their
fires
of
animal
fuel
and
cooked
their
food
at
sunset
the
view
from
the
roof
was
almost
beautiful
far
away
in
all
directions
stretched
the
level
desert
purpling
in
the
purple
light
very
faintly
on
the
far
horizon
to
the
mountain
ranges
were
painted
in
amethyst
on
an
orange
sky
horsemen
in
companies
galloped
to
tents
which
were
not
in
sight
strings
of
camels
cast
their
long
shadows
on
the
purple
sand
and
flocks
of
big
brown
sheep
led
by
armed
shepherds
converged
on
the
reedy
pool
in
long
brown
lines
the
evening
air
was
keen
nearly
frosty
the
prospects
for
the
night
were
not
encouraging
and
on
descending
the
filthy
stair
on
which
goats
had
taken
up
their
quarters
i
found
the
malodorous
crowded
courtyard
so
blocked
that
shepherds
with
much
pushing
shouting
and
barking
of
big
dogs
with
difficulty
made
a
way
for
me
to
pass
through
the
packed
mass
of
sheep
and
goats
into
the
cold
damp
tent
which
was
pitched
on
damp
manure
two
or
three
feet
deep
into
which
heavy
feet
had
trampled
the
carpet
the
uproar
of
and
travellers
went
on
for
another
two
hours
and
was
exchanged
later
for
sounds
of
jangling
bells
yelping
and
quarrelling
dogs
braying
asses
bleating
sheep
and
men
at
the
heavy
gates
clamped
with
iron
were
closed
and
barred
and
some
belated
travellers
eager
to
get
in
from
the
perils
of
the
outside
thundered
at
them
long
and
persistently
but
the
door
was
shut
and
they
encountered
a
hoarse
refusal
the
said
that
horses
and
mules
besides
camels
and
asses
sheep
and
over
men
were
lodged
in
the
caravanserai
that
night
the
servants
were
in
a
recess
near
and
hadji
professed
that
he
watched
all
night
and
said
that
he
fired
at
a
man
who
tried
to
rob
my
tent
after
the
light
went
out
but
i
slept
too
soundly
to
be
disturbed
till
the
caravans
and
flocks
left
at
daybreak
after
a
preliminary
uproar
of
two
hours
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
my
tent
and
its
contents
were
soaked
with
the
heavy
dew
nearly
doubling
their
weight
i
started
at
before
the
had
melted
and
rode
with
the
over
flat
stoneless
alluvial
soil
with
some
irrigation
and
the
remains
of
some
fine
canals
there
are
villages
to
be
seen
in
the
distance
but
though
the
soil
is
rich
enough
to
support
a
very
large
population
there
are
no
habitations
near
the
road
except
a
few
temporary
reed
huts
beside
two
large
caravanserais
there
was
little
of
an
interesting
kind
except
the
perpetual
contrast
between
things
as
they
are
and
things
as
they
were
and
might
be
some
large
graveyards
with
brick
graves
a
crumbling
a
pointed
arch
of
brick
over
the
nahrud
canal
a
few
ass
caravans
with
a
live
fowl
tied
by
one
leg
on
the
back
of
each
ass
and
struggling
painfully
to
keep
its
uneasy
seat
some
cultivation
and
much
waste
and
then
we
reached
the
walled
village
of
sheraban
once
a
town
but
now
only
possessing
houses
passing
as
usual
among
ruinous
dwellings
and
between
black
walls
with
doors
here
and
there
by
alleys
foul
with
heaps
of
refuse
and
dangerous
from
slimy
pitfalls
in
the
very
foulest
part
we
turned
into
the
caravanserai
its
great
courtyard
reeking
with
filth
and
puddles
among
which
are
the
contaminated
wells
from
which
we
are
supposed
to
drink
the
experience
of
the
night
before
was
not
repeated
there
were
fairly
good
rooms
mine
looking
into
a
palm
garden
through
a
wooden
grating
cold
truly
but
pleasant
i
fear
we
may
never
have
such
luxury
again
i
remarked
to
my
that
our
early
arrival
had
fortunately
given
us
the
choice
of
rooms
and
he
replied
choice
of
choice
of
dens
but
my
experience
at
wiyjahea
has
deprived
me
of
the
last
remnants
of
fastidiousness
i
walked
through
the
ruinous
wretched
town
and
its
poor
bazar
where
the
very
fine
of
the
men
was
in
marked
contrast
with
their
wretched
surroundings
and
gives
one
the
impression
that
under
honest
officials
they
might
be
a
fine
people
they
are
not
genial
to
strangers
however
there
was
some
bad
language
used
in
the
bazar
and
on
the
roads
they
pass
one
in
silence
at
the
best
so
unlike
the
tibetans
with
their
friendly
at
sheraban
one
of
the
muleteers
forced
his
way
into
my
room
and
roughly
turned
over
my
saddle
and
baggage
accusing
me
of
having
taken
his
blanket
hadji
is
useless
under
such
circumstances
he
blusters
and
fingers
his
revolver
but
carries
no
weight
indeed
his
defects
are
more
apparent
every
day
i
often
have
to
speak
to
him
two
or
three
times
before
i
can
rouse
him
from
his
opium
dream
and
there
is
a
growing
inclination
to
shirk
his
very
light
work
when
he
can
shift
it
upon
somebody
else
i
hope
that
he
is
as
that
would
cover
a
multitude
of
faults
but
he
is
very
rough
and
ignorant
and
is
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
learn
anything
even
how
to
put
up
my
trestle
bed
open
rooms
have
sundry
disadvantages
in
the
night
a
cat
fell
from
the
roof
upon
my
bed
and
was
soon
joined
by
more
and
they
knocked
over
the
lamp
and
milk
bottle
and
in
the
darkness
had
a
noisy
quarrel
over
the
milk
the
march
of
eighteen
miles
here
was
made
in
six
hours
at
a
good
caravan
pace
the
baggage
animals
were
sent
off
in
advance
and
the
led
a
mule
loaded
with
chairs
blankets
and
occupations
i
ride
with
the
in
front
of
me
till
i
get
near
the
when
m
and
his
orderly
overtake
me
as
it
might
be
disagreeable
for
a
european
woman
to
enter
a
town
alone
the
route
lies
over
treeless
levels
of
the
same
brown
alluvial
soil
till
it
is
lifted
on
a
gentle
gravelly
slope
to
a
series
of
low
crumbling
mounds
of
red
and
gray
sandstone
mixed
up
with
soft
conglomerate
rocks
of
jasper
and
porphyry
pebbles
these
ranges
of
mounds
known
as
the
hamrin
hills
run
parallel
to
the
great
kurdistan
ranges
from
a
point
considerably
below
baghdad
nearly
to
mosul
and
the
river
zab
they
mark
the
termination
in
this
direction
of
the
vast
alluvial
plains
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
and
are
the
first
step
to
the
uplifted
iranian
plateau
arid
and
intricate
ravines
dignified
by
the
name
of
passes
furrow
these
hills
and
bear
an
evil
reputation
as
arab
robbers
lie
in
wait
making
it
very
unsafe
for
small
caravans
a
wild
desolate
region
it
is
when
we
were
fairly
within
the
pass
the
stopped
and
with
much
gesticulation
and
many
repetitions
of
the
word
made
me
understand
that
it
was
unsafe
to
proceed
without
a
larger
party
we
were
unmolested
but
it
is
a
discredit
to
the
administration
of
the
province
that
an
organised
system
of
pillage
should
be
allowed
to
exist
year
after
year
on
one
of
the
most
frequented
caravan
routes
in
turkey
there
were
several
companies
of
armed
horsemen
among
the
ranges
and
some
camels
browsing
but
we
met
no
caravans
from
the
top
of
the
descent
there
was
a
striking
view
over
a
great
brown
alluvial
plain
watered
by
the
beladruz
and
the
diyalah
with
serrated
hills
of
no
great
height
but
on
its
east
side
a
silent
strange
weird
view
without
interest
or
beauty
as
seen
under
a
sullen
sky
there
are
no
villages
on
this
march
but
ancient
canals
run
in
all
directions
and
fragments
of
buildings
as
well
as
of
brick
and
pottery
scattered
over
the
unploughed
surface
are
supposed
by
many
to
mark
the
situation
of
dastagird
the
residence
of
khosroe
parviz
in
the
seventh
century
i
have
no
books
of
reference
with
me
and
can
seldom
write
except
of
such
things
as
i
see
and
hear
farther
on
a
multitude
of
irrigation
ditches
have
turned
a
plain
of
dry
friable
soil
into
a
plain
of
mud
through
which
it
was
difficult
to
struggle
then
came
a
grove
of
palms
and
then
the
town
or
village
of
kizil
robat
red
shrine
with
its
whose
reputation
for
sanctity
is
indicated
by
the
immense
number
of
graves
which
surround
it
the
walls
of
this
decayed
and
wretched
town
are
of
thick
layers
of
hardened
but
now
crumbling
earth
and
on
the
east
side
there
is
an
old
gateway
of
burned
brick
there
are
said
to
be
houses
which
at
the
lowest
computation
would
mean
a
population
of
but
inhabited
houses
and
ruins
are
so
jumbled
up
together
that
one
can
not
form
any
estimate
so
and
miserable
a
place
i
never
saw
and
the
dirt
is
appalling
even
in
this
dry
weather
in
spring
the
alleys
of
the
town
are
impassable
and
people
whose
business
calls
them
out
cross
from
roof
to
roof
on
boards
pools
of
filthy
water
loathsome
ditches
with
broad
margins
of
trodden
slime
full
of
abominations
ruins
of
houses
yards
foul
with
refuse
and
wholly
unwashed
children
men
of
low
aspect
standing
in
melancholy
groups
a
brick
bazar
in
which
manchester
cottons
are
prominent
more
mud
and
dirt
some
ruinous
caravanserais
and
near
the
extremity
of
the
town
or
village
is
the
horrible
one
in
which
i
now
am
said
to
be
the
best
with
a
yard
a
foot
deep
in
manure
and
slush
in
the
midst
of
which
is
the
well
and
around
which
are
stables
and
recesses
for
travellers
at
first
it
seemed
likely
that
i
should
fall
so
low
as
to
occupy
one
of
these
but
careful
investigation
revealed
a
ruinous
stair
leading
to
the
roof
up
which
were
two
rooms
or
shall
i
say
three
an
arched
recess
such
as
coals
are
kept
in
a
small
room
within
it
and
a
low
wood
hole
the
open
arch
with
a
or
iron
pan
of
charcoal
serves
as
the
parlour
this
january
night
m
occupies
the
wood
hole
and
i
the
one
room
into
which
hadji
with
many
groans
and
ejaculations
of
allah
has
brought
up
the
essential
parts
of
my
baggage
the
evening
is
gray
and
threatening
and
low
hills
look
grimly
over
the
bare
brown
plain
which
lies
outside
this
mournful
place
this
has
been
a
hard
rough
march
but
there
will
be
many
worse
ahead
rain
fell
heavily
all
night
converting
the
yard
into
a
lake
of
trampled
mud
and
seemed
so
likely
to
continue
that
it
was
difficult
to
decide
whether
to
march
or
halt
miserable
it
was
to
see
mules
standing
to
be
loaded
up
to
their
knees
in
mud
bales
of
tents
and
bedding
lying
in
the
quagmire
and
the
shivering
indian
servants
up
to
their
knees
in
the
swamp
in
rain
steadily
falling
the
twelve
animals
were
loaded
and
after
the
usual
scrimmage
at
starting
in
which
the
is
often
thrown
back
at
us
we
rode
out
into
a
sea
of
deep
mud
through
which
the
mules
struggling
and
floundering
got
on
about
a
mile
an
hour
after
a
time
we
came
to
gravel
then
relapsed
into
deep
alluvial
soil
which
now
means
deep
mire
then
a
low
range
of
gravelly
hills
on
which
a
few
sheep
and
camels
were
browsing
on
artemisia
and
other
aromatic
herbs
gave
a
temporary
respite
then
again
we
floundered
through
miles
of
mud
succeeded
by
miles
of
gravel
and
stones
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
there
was
a
cold
strong
wind
to
fight
against
there
was
that
amount
of
general
unpropitiousness
which
is
highly
stimulating
and
inspiriting
when
noon
came
there
was
not
a
rock
or
bush
for
shelter
and
turning
our
backs
to
the
storm
we
ate
our
lunch
in
our
saddles
there
was
nothing
to
look
at
but
brown
gravel
or
brown
mud
brooded
over
by
a
gray
mist
so
we
tramped
on
hour
after
hour
in
single
file
the
leading
everything
but
his
gun
muffled
in
his
brown
splashing
through
mud
and
water
the
water
pouring
from
my
hat
and
cloak
the
six
woollen
thicknesses
of
my
mask
dripping
seeing
neither
villages
nor
caravans
for
caravans
of
goods
do
not
travel
in
such
rain
as
this
then
over
a
slope
we
went
down
into
a
lake
of
mud
where
the
of
the
governor
of
khannikin
in
a
fez
and
military
and
trousers
with
a
number
of
bashi
bazouks
or
irregulars
met
m
with
courtesies
and
an
invitation
from
the
top
of
the
next
slope
there
was
a
view
of
khannikin
a
town
among
groves
of
palms
and
other
trees
then
came
a
worse
sea
of
mud
and
a
rudely
cobbled
causeway
so
horrible
that
it
diverted
us
back
into
the
mud
which
was
so
bottomless
that
it
drove
us
back
to
the
causeway
and
the
causeway
back
to
the
mud
the
rain
all
the
time
coming
down
in
sheets
this
causeway
without
improvement
is
carried
through
khannikin
a
town
with
narrow
blind
alleys
upon
which
foul
courtyards
open
often
so
foul
as
to
render
the
recent
ravages
of
cholera
if
science
speaks
truly
a
matter
of
necessity
the
mud
and
water
in
these
alleys
was
up
to
the
knees
of
the
mules
not
a
creature
was
in
the
streets
no
amount
of
curiosity
even
regarding
the
rare
sight
of
a
frank
woman
could
make
people
face
the
storm
in
flimsy
cotton
clothes
where
the
road
turns
to
the
bridge
a
line
of
irregular
infantry
was
drawn
up
poorly
dressed
soaked
creatures
standing
in
chilly
mud
up
to
their
ankles
in
soaked
boots
reaching
to
their
knees
these
joined
and
headed
the
cavalcade
and
i
fell
humbly
in
the
rear
poor
fellows
to
keep
step
was
impossible
when
it
was
hard
work
to
drag
their
feet
out
of
the
mire
and
they
carried
their
rifles
anyhow
it
was
a
grotesque
procession
a
trim
officer
forlorn
infantry
bashi
bazouks
europeans
in
stout
mackintoshes
splashed
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
mules
rolling
under
their
bespattered
loads
and
a
of
servants
and
orderlies
crouching
on
the
top
of
baggage
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
the
asses
which
carry
the
and
their
equipments
far
behind
staggering
and
nearly
done
up
for
the
march
of
seventeen
miles
had
taken
eight
and
a
half
hours
an
abrupt
turn
in
the
causeway
leads
to
the
holwan
a
tributary
of
the
diyalah
a
broad
rapid
stream
over
which
the
enterprise
of
a
persian
has
thrown
a
really
fine
brick
bridge
of
thirteen
arches
which
connects
the
two
parts
of
the
town
and
gives
some
dignity
and
picturesqueness
to
what
would
otherwise
be
mean
on
the
left
bank
of
the
holwan
are
the
barracks
the
governor
house
some
large
caravanserais
the
and
a
quarantine
station
quarantine
having
just
been
imposed
on
all
arrivals
from
persia
giving
travel
and
commerce
a
decided
check
after
half
a
mile
of
slush
on
the
river
bank
we
entered
by
a
handsome
gateway
a
nearly
flooded
courtyard
and
the
governor
house
hospitably
engorged
the
whole
party
the
mules
stuck
in
the
mud
a
few
miles
off
and
did
not
come
in
for
two
hours
and
in
spite
of
covers
everything
not
done
up
in
waterproof
was
very
wet
the
servants
looked
most
miserable
and
complained
of
chills
and
rheumatism
and
one
of
the
orderlies
is
really
we
can
not
move
till
the
storm
is
over
the
rain
falls
heavily
still
the
river
is
rising
the
alleys
are
two
feet
deep
in
slush
travel
is
absolutely
suspended
and
it
is
not
possible
without
necessity
to
go
out
it
was
well
indeed
that
we
decided
to
leave
the
shelterless
shelter
of
kizil
robat
nothing
can
exceed
the
wretchedness
of
khannikin
or
any
turkish
town
in
such
rain
as
this
would
that
one
could
think
that
it
would
be
washed
but
as
there
are
no
channels
to
carry
off
the
water
it
simply
lodges
and
stagnates
in
every
depression
and
all
the
accumulations
of
summer
refuse
slide
into
these
abominable
pools
and
the
foul
dust
a
foot
deep
becomes
mud
far
deeper
buried
things
are
half
uncovered
torrents
not
to
be
avoided
pour
from
every

the
courtyards
are
in
mud
the

stand
disconsolately
in
mud
not
a

to
be
seen
the
few
men
driven
forth
by
the
merciless
exigences
of
business
show
nothing
but
one
eye
and
with
loins
girded
and
big
staffs
move
wearily
stumbling
and
plunging
in
the
mire
after
some
hours
the
flat
mud

in
the

the

in

are
deserted
by

and
the
patient
sellers
crouch
over

up
in
sheepskins
the
caravanserais
are
crammed
and
quarrelsome
the
price
of
fodder
and
fuel
rises
and
every

is
drowned
in
rain
and
wretchedness
even
here
owing
to
the

nothing

down

unabated

footnote
i
present
my

much
as
they
were
written

that
the
details

wearisome

the
house
consists
of
two
courtyards
with
buildings
round
them
the
larger
and
handsomer
is
the
or
women
house
which
is
strictly
enclosed
has
no
exterior
windows
and
its
one
door
into
the
men
house
is
guarded
by
a
very
ancient
eunuch
the
courtyard
of
this
house
is
surrounded
partly
by
arched
with
green
lattice
fronts
and
partly
by
a
kitchen
bakery
or
hot
bath
and
the
servants
quarters
the
has
a
similar
arrangement
on
the
lower
floor
a
broad
balcony
reached
by
a
steep
and
narrow
stair
runs
round
three
sides
of
the
upper
part
of
this
house
there
are
very
few
rooms
and
some
of
them
are
used
for
storing
fruit
the
wet
baggage
is
mostly
up
here
and
under
the
deep
roof
the
servants

orderlies
camp
looking
miserable
the
has
a
balcony
all
round
it
on
which
a
number
of
reception
and
living
rooms
open
and
though
not
grand
or
elaborately
decorated
is
convenient
and
comfortable
the
turkish
host
evidently
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
such
an
embarrassing
guest
as
a
european
woman
and
solved
the
difficulty
by
giving
me
the
in
the
men
house
a
most
fortunate
decision
as
i
have
had
quiet
and
privacy
for
three
days
besides
this
room
has
a
projecting
window
with
panes
of
glass
held
in
by
nails
and
there
is
not
only
a
view
of
the
alley
with
its
slush
but
into
the
house
of
some
poor
folk
and
over
that
to
the
holwan
sometimes
in
spate
sometimes
falling
and
through
all
the
hours
of
daylight
frequented
by
grooms
for
the
purpose
of
washing
their
horses
some
shingle
banks
now
overflowed
sustain
a
few
scraggy
willows
and
on
the
farther
side
is
some
land
there
may
be
much
besides
but
the
heavy
blot
out
all
else
my
room
is
whitewashed
and
is
furnished
with
persian
rugs
austrian
chairs
and
a
divan
in
the
window
on
which
i
sleep
lamps
and
glasses
are
kept
in
recesses
and
a
black
slave
is
often
in
and
out
for
them
otherwise
no
one
enters
but
hadji
i
get
my
food
somewhat
precariously
it
is
carved
and
sent
from
table
at
the
beginning
of
meals
chiefly
pillau
curry
and
roast
chicken
but
apparently
it
is
not
etiquette
for
me
to
get
it
till
after
the
men
have
dined
and
it
is
none
the
better
for
being
cold
the
male
part
of
the
household
consists
of
the
governor
and
his
a
moslem

the

doctor
speak
french
my
lives
with
them
the
night
we
arrived
the
governor
in
some
agitation
asked
me
to
go
and
see
his
wife
who
is
very
ill
the
cholera
has
only
just
disappeared
and
the
lady
had

it
in
three
days
and
being
a
boy
her
heart
was
broken
and
something
had
come
under
her
arm
so
i
went
with
him
into
the
which
seemed
crowded
with
women
of
various
races
and
colours
peeping
from
behind
curtains
and
through
chinks
of
doors
tittering
and
whispering
the
wife
room
is
richly
carpeted
and
thoroughly
comfortable
with
a
huge
charcoal
brazier
in
the
centre
and
cushions
all
over
the
floor
except
at
one
end
where
there
is
a
raised
alcove
with
a
bed
in
it
on
this
the
lady
sat
a
rather
handsome
kurdish
woman
about
dressed
in
a
silk
quilted
jacket
and
with
a
black
gauze
handkerchief
round
her
head
and
a
wadded
quilt
over
her
crossed
legs
she
was
supported
by
a
pile
of
pillows
since
then
i
have
been
sent
for
to
see
her
several
times
every
day
and
found
her
always
in
the
same
position
there
is
surely
something
weird
about
it
she
says
she
sits
there
all
night
and
has
not
lain
down
for
two
months
a
black
slave
was
fanning
her
and
two
women
shrouded
in
veils
of
tinselled
gauze
sat
on
the
bed
combing
her
luxuriant
hair
she
is
not
really
beautiful
at
all
but
her
husband
assures
me
constantly
that
she
is
femme
she
has
property
and
the
consideration
which
attaches
to
it
she
was
burning
with
fever
and
very
weak
i
had
scarcely
returned
to
my
room
when
my
host
sent
again
begging
that
i
would
go
back
and
see
the
doctor
i
found
that
it
was
expected
that
i
should
persuade
the
lady
to
consent
to
have
the
abscess
or
whatever
it
is
reopened
the
room
was
full
of
women
and
eunuchs
and
the
chief
eunuch
an
elderly
arab
sat
on
the
bed
and
supported
her
while
the
doctor
dressed
the
wound
and
even
helped
him
with
it
her
screams
were
fearful
and
five
people
held
her
with
difficulty
her
husband
left
the
room
unable
to
bear
her
cries
quite
late
i
was
sent
for
again
and
that
time
by
the
lady
to
know
if
i
thought
she
would
die
it
appears
that
her
brother
the
judge
remains
here
to
see
that
she
is
not
the
victim
of
foul
play
but
i
do
like
to
ask
to
whom
the
suspicion
points
or
whether
our
host
although
the
civil
governor
keeps
him
here
that
he
may
not
be
suspected
in
case
his
rich
wife
dies
except
for
the
repeated
summonses
to
the
a
walk
on
the
slime
of
the
roof
when
the
rain
ceases
for
a
time
and
on
the
balcony
of
the
when
it
does
not
and
a
study
of
the
habits
of
my
neighbours
over
the
way
it
is
very
dull
i
have
patched
and
mended
everything
that
gave
any
excuse
for
either
operation
have
written
letters
which
it
is
not
safe
to
post
and
have
studied
my
one
book
on
persia
till
i
know
it
throughout
and
still
the
rain
falls
nearly
without
cessation
and
the
quagmires
outside
deepen
so
bad
is
it
that
dearly
as
orientals
love
bazars
and
hadji
refuses
leave
to
go
to
either
i
remarked
to
him
that
he
must
be
glad
of
such
a
rest
and
he
replied
in
his
usual
sententious
fashion
they
who
have
to
work
must
work
god
knows
all
i
fear
he
is
very
lazy
and
he
has
no
idea
of
making
one
comfortable
or
of
keeping
anything
clean
he
stamps
the
mud
of
the
courtyard
into
the
carpets
and
wipes
my
plates
without
washing
them
with
his
shirt
he
considers
that
our
host
has
attained
the
height
of
human
felicity
what
is
there
left
to
wish
for
he
says
he
has
numbers
of
slaves
and
always
buying
more
and
he
got
numbers
of
women
and
eunuchs
and
everything
and
when
he
wants
money
he
just
sends
round
the
villages
god
is
great
allah
khannikin
being
the
nearest
town
to
the
persian
frontier
should
be
a
place
of
some
importance
it
is
well
situated
at
an
altitude
of
feet
among
groves
of
palms
on
both
banks
of
the
holwan
and
having
plenty
of
water
the
rich
alluvium
between
it
and
yakobiyeh
is
able
to
support
its
own
population
though
it
has
to
import
for
caravans
most
of
the
persian
trade
with
baghdad
and
thousands
of
shiah
pilgrims
annually
pass
through
it
it
is
a
customs
station
and
has
a
regiment
of
soldiers
nevertheless
it
is
very
ruinous
and
its
population
has
diminished
of
late
years
from
to
about
exclusive
of
the
troops
and
of
this
number
a
fifth
have
been
carried
off
by
cholera
within
the
last
few
weeks
it
has
no
schools
and
no
special
industries
the
stamp
of
decay
rests
upon
it
exactions
crushing
hope
out
of
the
people
the
general
insecurity
of
property
and
the
misrule
which
has
blighted
these
fine
asiatic
provinces
everywhere
sufficiently
explain
its
decadence
the
imposition
of
quarantine
on
arrivals
from
persia
has
all
but
stopped
the
supply
of
charcoal
and
knowing
the
scarcity
in
the
house
i
am
going
without
a
fire
as
most
of
the
inhabitants
are
doing
a
large
caravanserai
outside
the
walls
is
used
as
a
quarantine
station
and
three
others
are
taken
as
lazarettos
out
of
these
arrangements
the
officials
make
a
great
deal
of
money
in
fees
but
anything
more
horrible
than
the
sanitary
state
of
these
places
can
not
be
conceived
the
water
appears
to
be
the
essence
of
typhoid
fever
and
cholera
and
the
unfortunate
are
crowded
into
holes
unfit
for
beasts
breathing
pestiferous
exhalations
and
surrounded
by
such
ancient
and
modern
accumulations
of
horrors
that
typhus
fever
cholera
and
even
the
plague
might
well
be
expected
to
break
out
yesterday
for
a
brief
interval
hills
covered
with
snow
appeared
through
rolling
black
clouds
and
a
change
seemed
probable
but
rain
fell
in
torrents
all
night
there
is
a
spate
in
the
river
and
though
we
were
ready
to
start
at
eight
this
morning
the
declined
to
move
saying
that
the
road
could
not
be
travelled
because
of
the
depth
of
the
fords
and
the
mud
the
roof
though
a
good
one
is
now
so
leaky
that
i
am
obliged
to
sleep
under
my
waterproof
cloak
and
the
let
in
the
rain
early
this
morning
a
gale
from
the
came
on
and
the
howling
and
roaring
have
been
frightful
the
rain
falling
in
sheets
most
of
the
time
sensations
are
not
wanting
one
of
the
orderlies
is
seriously
ill
and
has
to
be
left
behind
under
medical
care
till
he
can
be
sent
to
india
the
second
man
who
has
broken
down
a
runner
came
in
with
the
news
that
all
caravans
are
stopped
in
the
zagros
mountains
by
snow
which
has
been
falling
for
five
days
and
that
the
road
is
not
expected
to
be
open
for
a
fortnight
later
the
persian
agent
called
to
say
that
on
the
next
march
the
road
which
is
carried
on
a
precipice
above
the
river
has
slid
down
bodily
and
that
there
are
fifteen
feet
of
water
where
there
should
be
only
two
of
course
this
prolonged
storm
is
exceptional
the
temperature
is
falling
and
it
is
so
cold
without
a
fire
that
though
my
bed
is
only
a
dais
of
brick
and
lime
dripped
upon
continually
in
a
window
with
forty
draughts
i
am
glad
to
muffle
myself
up
in
its
blankets
and
write
among
wraps
the
governor
recognising
the
craze
of
europeans
for
exercise
sent
word
that
m
might
walk
in
the
balcony
of
the
if
i
went
to
chaperon
him
and
this
great
concession
was
gladly
accepted
for
it
was
the
only
possible
way
of
getting
warm
the
apparition
of
a
strange
man
and
a
european
within
the
precincts
of
the
was
a
great
event
and
every
window
curtain
and
doorway
was
taken
advantage
of
by
bright
dark
eyes
sparkling
among
folds
of
cotton
and
gauze
the
enjoyment
was
surreptitious
but
possibly
all
the
more
keen
and
sounds
of
whispering
and
giggling
surged
out
of
every
crevice
there
are
over
thirty
women
some
of
them
negresses
some
are
kurds
and
very
handsome
but
the
faces
of
the
two
handsomest
though
quite
young
have
something
fiendish
in
their
expression
i
have
seldom
seen
a
without
its
tragedies
of
jealousy
and
hate
and
every
fresh
experience
makes
me
believe
that
the
system
is
as
humiliating
to
men
as
it
is
to
women
the
here
are
large
and
bright
with
roofs
and
cornices
worked
daintily
in
very
white
plaster
and
there
are
superb
carpets
on
the
floors
and
divans
covered
with
damascus
embroidery
in
gold
silk
on
cream
muslin
each
day
the
demands
for
my
presence
in
the
are
more
frequent
and
though
i
say
that
i
can
scarcely
aspire
to
be
a
nurse
they
persist
in
thinking
that
i
am
a
and
possibly
a
useful
spy
on
the
doctor
i
have
become
aware
that
unscrupulous
jealousy
of
the
principal
wife
exists
and
as
is
usual
in
the
east
everybody
distrusts
everybody
else
and
prefers
to
trust
strangers
the
husband
frequently
asks
me
to
remove
what
seems
a
cancerous
tumour
and
the
doctor
says
that
an
operation
is
necessary
to
save
the
lady
life
but
when
i
urge
him
to
perform
it
and
offer
a
help
he
replies
that
if
she
were
to
die
he
would
be
at
once
accused
of
murder
and
would
run
a
serious
risk
the
governor
was
so
anxious
that
i
should
persuade
the
lady
to
undergo
an
operation
that
he
even
brought
hadji
into
the
room
to
interpret
what
i
said
in
arabic
his
ceaseless
question
is
will
she
die
and
she
asks
me
the
same
many
times
every
day
she
insists
that
i
shall
be
present
each
day
when
the
wound
is
dressed
and
give
help
lest
the
doctor
without
her
leave
should
plunge
a
knife
into
the
swelling
these
are
most
distressing
occasions
for
an
hour
of
struggle
and
suffering
usually
ends
in
delirium
this
afternoon
however
she
was
much
freer
from
pain
and
sent
for
me
to
amuse
her
she
wore
some
fine
jewels
and
some
folds
of
tinselled
gauze
round
her
head
and
looked
really
handsome
and
intelligent
her
husband
wished
that
we
could
converse
without
his
imperfect
interpreting
and
repeated
many
times
she
is
a
learned
woman
and
can
write
and
read
several
languages
the
room
was
as
usual
full
of
women
who
had
removed
their
veils
at
their
lord
command
i
showed
the
lady
some
tibetan
sketches
but
when
i
came
to
one
of
a
man
the
women
replaced
their
veils
when
i
showed
some
embroidery
the
governor
said
he
had
heard
that
the
queen
of
england
employed
herself
with
her
needle
in
leisure
hours
but
that
it
is
not
il
here
for
ladies
to
work
it
seems
that
the
making
of
sweetmeats
is
the
only
occupation
which
can
be
pursued
without
loss
of
dignity
is
it
wonderful
that
intolerable
should
be
productive
of
the
miserable
jealousies
rivalries
intrigues
and
hatreds
which
accompany
the
system
of
polygamy
the
host
although
civil
governor
of
a
large
district
also
suffers
from
the
necessary
official
duties
are
very
light
and
the
accounts
and
reports
are
prepared
by
others
if
money
is
wanted
he
makes
an
exaction
on
a
village
and
subordinates
screw
it
out
of
the
people
justice
or
the
marketable
commodity
which
passes
for
such
is
administered
by
a
he
clatters
about
the
balconies
with
slippered
feet
is
domestic
that
is
he
spends
most
of
the
day
in
the
smokes
eats
two
meals
of
six
or
seven
courses
each
and
towards
evening
takes
a
good
deal
of
wine
according
to
a
habit
which
is
becoming
increasingly
common
among
the
higher
classes
of
moslems
he
is
hospitable
and
is
certainly
anything
but
tyrannical
in
his
household
the
customs
and
ways
of
the
first
turkish
house
i
have
visited
in
would
be
as
interesting
to
you
as
they
were
to
myself
but
it
would
be
a
poor
return
for
hospitality
to
dwell
upon
anything
unless
like
the
difficulties
regarding
the
illness
of
the
principal
wife
it
were
a
matter
of
common
notoriety
it
is
a
punishable
act
in
persia
and
possibly
here
also
to
look
into
a
neighbour
house
but
i
can
not
help
it
unless
i
were
to
avoid
the
window
altogether
wealth
and
poverty
are
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
and
as
moslems
are
charitable
to
a
degree
and
in
a
manner
which
puts
us
to
shame
the
juxtaposition
is
advantageous
my
neighbour
premises
consist
of
a
very
small
and
mean
yard
now
a
foot
deep
in
black
mire
a

a
room
without

with
a

of
dubious
age
two
girls
from
eight

that

and
thistles
in

in

of

makes

sets
it

she
wades
across

gives
the

a

of
thistles
milks
it
into

basin
adds
a
little
leaven
to
the

skin
till
it
is
thick
carries
the
skin
and
basket
to
the
house
feeds
the
fowls
from
the
basket
and
then
rouses
her
lord
he
rises
stretches
himself
yawns
and
places
himself
by
the
fire
after
putting
on
his
the
room
is
dense
with
pungent
wood
smoke
which
escapes
through
the
doorway
and
only
a
few
embers
remain
the
wife
hands
him
an
earthen
bowl
pours
some
porridge
into
it
adds
some
thick
milk
from
the
goat
skin
and
stands
before
him
with
her
arms
crossed
while
he
eats
then
receives
the
bowl
from
his
hands
and
kisses
it
as
is
usual
with
the
slaves
in
a
household
then
she
lights
his
pipe
and
while
he
enjoys
it
she
serves
her
boy
with
breakfast
in
the
same
fashion
omitting
the
concluding
ceremony
after
which
she
and
the
girls
retire
to
a
respectful
distance
with
the
big
pot
and
finish
its
contents
simultaneously
the
pipe
over
she
pours
water
on
her
lord
hands
letting
it
run
on
the
already
damp
floor
and
wipes
them
with
her
no

customary
in

man
is
he
is
a

and
having
brought
from
mecca
a
prayer
stone
with
the
prophet
hand
upon
it
he
takes
it
from
his
girdle
puts
it
on
the
floor
bows
his
forehead
on
it
turning
and
says
his
prayers
repeating
his
devotions
towards
evening
the
first
day
or
two
he
went
out
but
the
roads
now
being
almost
impassable
he
confines
himself
to
the
repairing
of
a
small
dyke
which
keeps
the
water
from
running
into
the
room
which
is
lower
than
the
yard
and
performs
its
duty
very
imperfectly
the
soak
from
the
yard
and
the
drip
from

to

i
prefer
the

with
the
swinishness
of

to
receiving
hospitality

iv
the

at

ceased
and
after
the
had
squabbled
for
an
hour
over
the
baggage
we
got
off
at
ten
two
days
ago
very
grateful
for
shelter
and
hospitality
under
such
untoward
circumstances
six
bashi
bazouks
and
two
on
foot
in
ragged
and
incongruous
uniforms
escorted
us
to
the
turkish
frontier
the
streets
were
in
a
terrible
condition
and
horse
and
footmen
after
an
attempt
to
march
in
pairs
fell
perforce
into
a
floundering
and
disorderly
single
file
the
footmen
occasionally
pulling
themselves
out
of
mud
holes
by
the
tails
of
the
horses
outside
the
town
there
was
an
expanse
of
mud
and
flooded
which
broke
up
the
last
attempt
at
a
procession
and
led
to
a
general
qui
the
mire
was
tenacious
and
up
to
the
horses
knees
half
the
mules
were
down
with
their
loads

rolled
into
the
mud
my
capable
animal
snorted
and
struggled
some
went
on
banks
and
some
took
to
streams
the
asses
had
to
be
relieved
of
their
loads
and
the
air
was
full
of
shouts
and
objurgations
till
after
much
delay
the
forlorn
rabble
all
struggled
to
the
of
a
gravelly
slope
splashed
from
head
to
foot
the
road
crosses
low
rolling
gravelly
hills
with
an
occasional
outcrop
of
red
sandstone
and
ascends
on
the
whole
the
sun
was
bright
but
the
wind
was
strong
and
very
cold
the
bashi
bazouk
escort
was
altogether
and
inconsequent
careering
in
circles
and
firing
at
birds
which
they
never
hit
from
the
saddle
and
when
we
reached
some
low
hills
bearing
a
bad
reputation
the
officer
in
order
to
represent
danger
and
his
vigilant
care
threw
them
out
in
all
directions
scouting
for
robbers
till
we
came
to
a
steepish
hill
crowned
by
a
round
tower
with
a
mushroom
top
a
few
ruinous
mud
buildings
and
a
tattered
tent
here
the
escort
formed
into
one
line
and
the
ragged
garrison
into
another
with
an
officer
facing
them
and
were
photographed
as
they
shivered
in
the
biting
wind
this
tower
is
a
turkish
frontier
fort
soon
afterwards
the
persian
frontier
is
crossed
the
hills
increase
considerably
in
size
and
mud
was
exchanged
for
firm
rough
gravel
a
feature
of
the
otherwise
featureless
landscape
is
the
frequent
occurrence
of
towers
like
martello
towers
on
placed
there
for
the
shelter
of
the
guards
who
formerly
kept
a
for
robbers
in
the
uninteresting
gravel

the
first
object
of
the
slightest
interest
in
this
new
country
was
a
village
of
ilyats
built
of
reed
screens
with
roofs
of
cloth
and
with
small
yards
with
reed
walls
in
front
the
women
who
wore
full
trousers
and
short
jackets
were
tall
somewhat
and
unveiled
their
hair
hung
down
in
long
plaits
and
they
wore
red
handkerchiefs
knotted
at
the
back
of
the
head
there
an
escort
of
four
persian
joined
us
the
type
of
face
was
that
with
which
we
are
familiar
on
sasanian
coins
and
sculptured
stones
the
brow
and
chin
receding
considerably
and
the
nose
thin
and
projecting
the
profile
suggesting
a
beak
rather
than
a
human
face
and
the
skin
having
the
appearance
of
being
drawn
so
tightly
over
the
bones
as
to
force
the
eyes
into
singular
prominence

a
six
hours
march
ended
at
the
village
of
high
on
the
right
bank
of
the
holwan
with
a
plantation
of
dates
on
the
left
bank
and
considerable
cultivation
in
the
valley
it
has
only
eighty
houses
of
the
most
wretched
construction
rivalled
in
height
and
size
by
middens
the
drainage
of
which
wastes
itself
on
the
wretched
roadway
a
caravanserai
of
the
most
miserable
description
a
square
fort
with
a
small
garrison
and
some
large
graveyards
with
domed
tombs
and
curious
obelisks
are
the
salient
features
of
this
village
its
wretched
aspect
is
accounted
for
by
its
insecurity
it
has
been
destroyed
by
robber
tribes
as
often
as
there
was
anything
worth
destroying
and
it
has
been
so
tossed
to
and
fro
between
turkey
and
persia
as
not
to
have
any
of
the
special
characteristics
of
either
empire
we
stopped
short
of
the
village
at
a
great
pile
of
building
on
a
height
in
massiveness
and
irregularity
resembling
a
german
medieval
castle
in
which
a
letter
had
secured
accommodation
it
has
been
unoccupied
since
its
owner
jan
mir
a
sheikh
of
a
robber
tribe
and
the
terror
of
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
was
made
away
with
by
the
persian
government
the
accommodation
consisted
of
great
dark
arched
vaulted
rooms
with
floors
noble
in
size
but
needing
fifty
candles
and
huge
log
fires
to
light
up
and
warm
their
dark
recesses
and
gruesome
and
damp
with
one
candle
and
a
crackle
of
twigs
they
were
clean
however
and
their
massive
walls
kept
out
the
cold
the
village
is
at
an
elevation
of
feet
and
the
temperature
has
greatly
changed
the
interest
of
is
that
it
lies
among
masses
of
ancient
rubble
and
that
the
slopes
which
surround
it
are
completely
covered
with
hewn
and
unhewn
stones
of
all
sizes
the
relics
of
a
great
city
at
the
western
extremity
of
which
the
present
wretched
hamlet
stands
the
walls
which
are
easily
traced
enclose
an
irregular
square
the
shortest
front
of
which
is
said
to
be
three
miles
long
they
are
built
of
blocks
of
gray
and
red
sandstone
and
very
hard
mortar
or
concrete
the
blocks
are
so
huge
in
many
places
as
to
deserve
the
often
misused
epithet
cyclopean
within
this
enclosure
are
remains
of
houses
built
of
round
stones
which
lie
in
monstrous
heaps
and
of
a
large
fort
on
an
eminence
in
another
direction
are
the
ruins
of
an
immense
palace
of
quadrangular
form
with
only
one
entrance
and
large
underground
rooms
now
nearly
choked
up
there
are
remains
of
what
must
have
been
very
fine
archways
but
as
the
outer
coating
of
hewn
stone
and
all
the
decorations
have
fallen
off
leaving
only
the
inner
case
of
rough
rubble
and
concrete
the
architectural
forms
are
very
badly
defined
and
the
aspect
of
what
must
once
have
been
magnificent
is
now
forbidding
and
desolate
the
remains
of
an
aqueduct
cut
in
the
rock
and
of
troughs
and
stone
pipes
by
which
water
was
brought
into
the
palace
and
city
from
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
are
still
traceable
among
the
desolations
but
of
the
beautiful
gardens
which
they
watered
and
with
which
khosroe
surrounded
the
beautiful
shirin
not
a
trace
remains
there
was
a
pale
sunset
flushing
with
pale
pink
distant
leagues
of
sodden
snow
and
right
across
a
lurid
opening
in
a
heavy
mass
of
black
clouds
the
great
ruined
pile
of
the
palace
of
khosroe
the
magnificent
stood
out
a
dismal
commentary
on
splendour
and
fame
the
promise
of
the
evening
was
fulfilled
the
next
day
in
windy
rain
which
began
gently
but
afterwards
fell
in
persistent
torrents
varied
by
pungent
swirls
of
sleet
and
snow
leaving
the
gash
through
cliffs
with
curious
stratification
in
white
and
red
formed
by
the
holwan
the
day
was
spent
in
skirting
or
crossing
low
hills
the
mud
was
very
deep
and
tenacious
and
the
rate
of
progress
barely
two
miles
an
hour
there
were
no
caravans
travellers
or
population
and
no
birds
or
beasts
the
rain
clouds
hung
low
and
heavy
mists
boiled
up
from
among
the
folds
of
the
hills
the
temperature
fell
perceptibly
it
was
really
inspiriting
for
people
protected
by
good
mackintoshes
after
riding
for
six
hours
the
rain
changed
into
sleet
and
wet
snow
blotting
out
the
hills
and
creating
an
unnatural
twilight
in
which
we
floundered
in
mud
up
to
the
mules
knees
into
the
filthiest
village
i
have
ever
seen
a
compound
of
foul
green
ditches
piles
of
dissolving
manure
mud
hovels
looking
as
if
they
were
dissolving
too
reed
huts
and
an
ilyat
village
grouped
round
the
vilest
of
caravanserais
the
entrance
to
which
was
in
mire
to
lodge
in
it
was
voted
impossible
and
the
escort
led
us
in
the
darkening
mist
and
pelting
sleet
to
an
adjacent
mud
hamlet
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
where
standing
up
to
the
knees
of
the
mules
in
liquid
manure
we
sought
but
vainly
for
shelter
forded
the
holwan
and
returned
to
the
caravanserai
through
almost
impassable
slush
it
was
simply
loathsome
with
its
stench
its
foulness
and
its
mire
and
was
already
crowded
and
noisy
with
men
and
beasts
there
was
a
great
courtyard
with
arched
recesses
all
round
too
abominable
to
be
occupied
too
exposed
and
ruinous
even
had
they
been
cleaned
to
give
shelter
from
the
driving
sleet
the
last
resource
was
to
pass
through
an
archway
into
the
great
lofty
mule
stable
on
both
sides
of
which
are
similar
recesses
or
mangers
about
ten
feet
by
seven
and
about
eight
feet
high
the
stable
was
of
great
size
and
height
with
a
domed
roof
probably
it
runs
round
the
quadrangle
at
the
back
of
the
uninhabitable
recesses
there
were
at
least
four
hundred
mules
in
this
place
jangling
their
great
bells
and
crowds
of
travellers
and
all
wet
and
splashed
over
their
heads
with
mud
some
unloading
others
making
fires
and
feeding
their
mules
all
shouting
when
they
had
anything
to
say
the
babel
aggravated
by
the
clatter
of
the
rattles
of
a
hundred
and
the
squeals
of
fighting
horses
illustration
lodgings
for
travellers
the
floor
was
deep
with
the
manure
of
ages
and
piled
with
bales
and
boxes
in
the
side
recesses
which
are
about
the
height
of
a
back
the
muleteers
camped
with
their
fires
and
their
goods
and
laid
the
provender
for
their
beasts
in
the
front
these
places
are
the
mangers
of
the
eastern
caravanserai
or
or
inn
such
must
have
been
the
inn
at
bethlehem
and
surely
the
first
step
to
the
humiliation
of
the
death
of
the
cross
must
have
been
the
birth
in
the
manger
amidst
the
crowd
and
horrors
of
such
a
stable
the
odour
was
overpowering
and
the
noise
stunning
and
when
our
wet
baggage
animals
came
in
adding
to
the
din
there
was
hardly
room
to
move
far
less
for
the
roll
in
which
all
mules
indulge
when
the
loads
are
taken
off
and
the
crush
resulted
in
a
fight
and
one
mule
got
his
upon
my
manger
and
threatened
to
share
it
with
me
it
was
an
awful
place
to
come
to
after
a
six
hours
march
in
rain
and
snow
but
i
slid
off
my
mule
into
the
recess
had
it
carpeted
put
down
my
chair
hung
a
blanket
up
in
front
and
prepared
to
brave
it
when
the
inhabitants
of
this
room
the
one
place
which
has
any
pretensions
to
being
a
room
in
the
village
were
bribed
by
an
offer
of
six
about
four
shillings
to
vacate
it
for
me
its
pretensions
consist
in
being
over
a
gateway
and
in
having
a
door
and
a
square
hole
looking
on
the
street
a
crumbling
stair
slippery
with
mud
leads
up
to
it
the
roof
leaks
in
every
direction
and
the
slimy
floor
is
full
of
pools
but
it
is
luxury
after
the
caravanserai
stable
and
with
one
waterproof
sheet
over
my
bed
and
another
over
myself
i
have
fared
well
though
the
door
can
not
be
shut
and
the
rest
of
the
party
are
in
the
stable
at
an
impassable
distance
our
language
happily
has
no
words
in
which
the
state
of
this
village
can
be
described
in

of
this
room
is
a
broken
ditch
full
of
slimy

water
which
hadji
took
for
my
tea
there
has
been
a
slight
snowfall
during
the
night

have
now
reached
a
considerable
altitude

expect
anything

climbed

says
we

help
us
from
we
are
taking
the
most
southerly
of
the
three
routes
to
kirmanshah
traversed
by

rawlinson
in
a
sea
of

varied
by
patches
of
sodden
snow

of

with
narrow
passes
great
mountains
seen
spectrally
for

at
a

of
nomads
villages
and
a
long
cold
steep
ascent
among
scrub
oaks
and
dwarf
ash
to
snow
which
was
not
melting
and
the
hospitalities
of
a
kurdish
village
comprise
the
interests
of
the
march
from
saripul
to
myan
tak
so
far
as
they
lie
on
the
surface
but
in
various
ways
this
part
of
kurdistan
has
many
interests
not
to
be
absolutely
ignored
even
in
a
familiar
letter
here
the
ilyats
who
are
supposed
to
constitute
a
fifth
of
the
rural
population
of
persia
are
met
with
in
large
numbers
and
their
brown
flocks
and
herds
are
still
picking
up
a
scanty
subsistence
the
great
chief
of
this
the
gur
n
tribe
holds
the
region
on
an
annual
payment
to
the
persian
government
gives
grain
to
his
tribesmen
and
receives
from
them
of
corn
and
of
rice
of
the
crop
these
people
sow
their
grain
in
early
spring
and
then
move
up
with
their
flocks
to
the
mountain
pastures
leaving
behind
only
a
few
men
to
harvest
the
crops
they
use
no
manure
this
being
required
for
fuel
and
in
the
case
of
rice
they
allow
a
fallow
of
at
least
seven
years
there
are
very
few
cultivators
resident
upon
these
lands
but
ilyat
camps
occur
frequently
the
region
is
steeped
in
history
the
wretched
village
of
saripul
is
the
calah
of
asshur
and
the
halah
of
the
israelitish
captivity
and
gave
to
the
surrounding
country
the
name
of
chalonitis
which
we
have
on
our
old
maps
a
metropolitan
see
in
the
fifth
century
soon
after
the
institution
of
the
nestorian
hierarchy
it
was
called
calah
halah
and
holwan
if
the
diyalah
be
the
ancient
gyndes
noteworthy
for
the
singular
delay
of
cyrus
on
his
march
to
babylon
and
saripul
the
ancient
holwan
and
if
in
addition
to
the
numerous
chald√¶an
and
sasanian
remains
there
are
relics
of
semiramis
and
of
the
of
the
magi
the
crowd
of
historic
associations
is
almost
too
much
for
one
day
and
i
will
return
to
the
insignificant
details
of
the
journey
we
left
at
nine
crossed
the
holwan
by
a
brick
bridge
and
in
falling
snow
and
deep
mud
rode
over
fairly
level
ground
till
we
came
to
an
abrupt
range
of
limestone
rock
with
a
natural
rift
across
which
the
foundations
of
a
wall
still
remain
the
clouds
were
rolling
low
and
the
snow
was
driving
wildly
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
see
the
sculptured
tablet
described
by
rawlinson
and
layard
on
which
a
of
the
magi
is
represented
with
one
hand
raised
in
benediction
and
the
other
grasping
a
scroll
the
dress
being
the
pontifical
robe
worn
by
the
zoroastrian
priests
with
a
square
cap
pointed
in
front
and
lappets
covering
the
mouth
above
this
is
a
tomb
with
an
ornamented
entrance
we
were
now
among
a
very
strange
and
mysterious
people
of
whose
ancestry
and
actual
beliefs
very
little
is
known
they
are
but
europeans
often
speak
of
them
as
davidites
from
their
special
veneration
for
king
david
this
tomb
in
the
rift
is
called
or
david
shop
and
the
people
believe
that
he
still
dwells
there
and
come
on
pilgrimages
and
to
offer
animals
in
sacrifice
from
all
parts
of
kurdistan
he
is
believed
to
work
as
a
smith
and
the
say
that
he
makes
suits
of
fine
armour
a
part
of
the
tomb
which
is
divided
from
the
rest
by
a
low
partition
is
believed
to
be
a
reservoir
containing
the
water
which
he
uses
to
temper
his
metal
a
great
mound
with
some
building
in
the
centre
on
the
right
of
the
road
near
this
gorge
though
properly
it
bears
another
name
is
called
by
the
people
david
fort
jewish
traditions
abound
specially
concerning
david
who
is
regarded
by
the
tribes
as
their
great
tutelar
prophet
the
gur
ns
and
kalhurs
who
are
the
nomadic
inhabitants
of
this
district
are
of
a
very
marked
type
of
physiognomy
so
israelitish
indeed
that
taken
along
with
certain
traditions
of
their
origin
their
jewish
names
and
their
veneration
for
david
they
have
been
put
forward
as
claimants
to
the
dignity
of
being
the
lost
tribes
the
great
hebrew
traveller
of
the
twelfth
century
to
whom
i
have
referred
before
believed
that
the
whole
of
the
were
jews
and
writes
of
synagogues
in
the
zagros
mountains
and
of
jewish
families
in
the
neighbourhood
as
we
shall
be
for
some
days
among
these
people
i
will
abbreviate
sir
rawlinson
sketch
of
their
tenets
he
considers
that
bears
evident
marks
of
judaism
mixed
up
with
moslem
christian
and
sab√¶an
legends
the
believe
in
incarnations
of
the
godhead
in
a
series
among
them
benjamin
moses
elias
david
jesus
christ
ali
and
salman
his
tutor
the
imam
houssein
and
the
haft
n
or
seven
bodies
the
chief
spiritual
guides
in
the
early
ages
of
islam
and
each
worshipped
as
a
deity
is
an
object
of
adoration
in
some
locality
of
kurdistan
the
tomb
of
one
of
these
b
b
yadg
r
is
their
holy
place
and
this
was
regarded
as
the
dwelling
of
elijah
at
the
time
when
the
arabs
invaded
persia
all
these
incarnations
are
regarded
as
of
one
and
the
same
person
all
that
changes
is
the
bodily
form
of
the
divine
manifestation
there
are
degrees
in
the
perfection
of
the
development
and
the
most
perfect
forms
are
benjamin
david
and
ali
practically
however
the
metaphysical
speculations
involved
in
this
creed
of
successive
incarnations
are
unknown
and
the
imam
ali
the
cousin
of
mohammed
is
the
great
object
of
worship
though
professing
mohammedanism
the
are
held
in
great
horror
by
believers
and
those
of
this
region
lie
under
the
stigma
of
practising
unholy
rites
as
a
part
of
their
religion
and
have
received
the
name
of
chiragh
sonderan
the
of
lights
this
accusation
sir
layard
observes
may
be
only
a
calumny
invented
like
many
another
to
justify
persecution
passing
through
the
rift
in
the
range
which
has
led
to
this
digression
we
entered
an
ascending
valley
between
the
range
through
which
we
had
passed
and
some
wild
mountains
covered
with
snow
which
were
then
actively
engaged
in
brewing
a
storm
farther
on
there
was
irrigation
and
cultivation
and
then
the
wretched
village
of
pai
tak
and
the
ruins
of
a
bridge
there
the
people
told
us
we
must
halt
as
the
caravanserai
at
the
next
place
was
already
full
and
we
plunged
about
in
the
snow
and
mud
looking
for
a
hovel
in
which
to
take
shelter
but
decided
to
risk
going
on
and
shortly
began
the
ascent
of
the
remarkable
pass
known
as
the
gates
of
zagros
on
the
ancient
highway
between
babylonia
and
media
by
which
in
a
few
hours
the
mountain
barrier
of
zagros
is
crossed
and
the
plain
of
kirrind
a
part
of
the
great
iranian
plateau
is
reached
this
great
road
which
zigzags
steeply
up
the
pass
is
partly
composed
of
smoothed
boulders
and
partly
of
natural
rock
somewhat
dressed
and
much
worn
by
the
continual
passage
of
shod
animals
it
is
said
to
be
much
like
a
torrent
bed
but
the
snow
was
lying
heavily
upon
it
filling
up
its
inequalities
dwarf
oaks
hawthorn
ash
and
other
scrub
find
in
every
crevice
all
that
may
be
ugly
was
draped
in
pure
white
and
looking
back
from
the
surrounding
glitter
the
view
of
low
ranges
lying
in
indigo
gloom
was
very
striking
on
the
ascent
there
is
a
remarkable
arch
of
great
blocks
of
white
marble
with
a
vaulted
recess
called
the
the
arch
holding
the
road
which
gives
the
popular
name
of
the
pass
of
to
the
ascent
though
the
geographers
call
it
the
defile
of
holwan
after
the
deep
mud
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
march
it
was
a
pleasure
to
ride
through
pure
deep
powdery
snow
and
to
find
the
dirt
of
the
village
of
myan
tak
a
kurdish
hamlet
situated
on
a
mountain
torrent
among
steep
hills
and
small
trees
covered
with
this
radiant
mantle
the
elevation
of
the
pass
is
feet
but
myan
tak
is
at
a
lower
altitude
an
hour
farther
on
the
small
and
ruinous
caravanserai
was
really
full
of
caravans
detained
by
the
snowstorm
and
we
lodged
in
a
kurdish
house
typical
of
the
style
of
architecture
common
among
the
settled
tribes
within
a
wide
doorway
without
a
door
high
enough
for
a
loaded
mule
to
enter
is
a
very
large
room
with
a
low
flat
mud
roof
supported
on
three
rows
of
misshapen
trunks
of
trees
with
their
branches
cut
off
about
a
foot
from
the
stem
all
black
and
shiny
with
smoke
mud
and
rubble
platforms
two
feet
high
run
along
one
side
and
one
end
and
on
the
end
one
there
is
a
clay
fireplace
but
no
chimney
under
this
platform
the
many
fowls
are
shut
in
at
night
by
a
stone
at
the
hole
by
which
they
enter
within
this
room
is
a
perfectly
dark
stable
of
great
size
certainly
forty
mules
besides
asses
and
oxen
were
lodged
in
it
and
the
overflow
shared
the
with
a
number
of
kurds
servants
dogs
soldiers
and
europeans
the
furniture
consisted
of
guns
and
swords
hanging
on
the
walls
the
owner
is
an
old
kurd
with
some
handsome
sons
with
ruddy
complexions
and
auburn
hair
the
big
house
is
the
patriarchal
roof
where
the
patriarch
his
sons
their
wives
and
children
and
their
animals
dwell
together
the
women
however
had
all
been
got
rid
of
somehow
the
old
kurd
made
a
great
fire
on
the
dais
wood
being
plentiful
and
crouched
over
it
my
bed
was
pitched
near
it
and
enclosed
by
some
reed
screens
with
chairs
and
a
table
with
routes
maps
writing
materials
and
a
good
lantern
upon
it
an
excellent
dinner
of
soup
and
a
leg
of
mutton
cooked
at
a
bonfire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
the
sight
of
all
the
servants
and
lying
round
it
warm
and
comfortable
and
the
knowledge
that
we
were
above
the
mud
the
clouds
of
blinding
smoke
which
were
the
only
drawback
scarcely
affected
the
cheerfulness
and
comfort
of
the
blazing
unstinted
fire
the
doorway
gave
not
only
ample
ventilation
but
a
brilliant
view
of
snow
and
of
myriads
of
frosty
stars
it
was
infinitely
picturesque
with
the
fitful
firelight
falling
on
the
uncouth
avenues
of
blackened
on
big
dogs
on
ox
faces
and
long
ass
ears
on
turbaned
indian
heads
and
on
a
confused
crowd
of
turks
kurds
and
persians
some
cooking
some
sleeping
some
smoking
while
from
the
black
depth
beyond
a
startling
bray
of
an
ass
or
the
abortive
shriek
of
a
mule
occasionally
proceeded
or
a
stray
mule
created
a
commotion
by
rushing
in
from
the
snow
outside
i
slept
comfortably
till
i
was
awakened
early
by
various
country
sounds
the
braying
of
an
ass
into
my
ear
for
i
was
within
a
few
inches
of
the
stable
the
crowing
of
cocks
and
some
hens
picking
up
crumbs
upon
my
bed
the
mules
were
loaded
in
the
the
mercury
was
only
at
and
under
cloudless
sunshine
the
powdery
snow
glittered
and
crackled
there
were
difficulties
ahead
we
heard
the
road
heavily
blocked
with
snow
was
only
just
open
and
the
persian
post
which
should
have
passed
hours
before
had
not
been
heard
of
showing
that
the
snow
is
very
deep
farther
on
it
was
beautiful
that
uplifted
silent
world
of
snow
and
mountains
on
whose
skirts
for
some
miles
grew
small
apple
and
pear
trees
oak
ash
and
hawthorn
each
twig
a
coral
spray
in
the
deepest
depression
among
great
rocks

arrested

with
icicles

getting
through
this
picturesque
forest

the
road

on
the
plateau
of
the
kirrind
valley
the
greatest
altitude
of
which
is
about
feet
it
is
said
to
be
irrigated
and
fertile
it
is
now
as
i
describe
it
a
wide
valley
without
a
tree
or
bush
a
rolling
plain
of
snow
from
two
to
three
feet
deep
marked
only
by
lines
made
by
birds

and
the
beating
of
the
tips
of
wings
the
track
across
it
a
corrugated
trench
wide
enough
for
one

the
sun
brilliant
the

the
surface
of
the

flashing
light
from
millions
of
crystals
with
a
glitter
not
to
be
borne
all
dazzling
glistering
silent
a
white
world
and
a
blue
heaven
with
a
sun
shining
in
his
strength
light
without
heat
it
has
been
a
tremendous
day
march
only
fourteen
miles
in
seven
and
a
half
hours
of
severe
toil
the
asked
us
to
keep
together
in
case
of
difficulties
with
caravans
difficulties
indeed
a
mild
term
i
was
nearly
smashed
i
little
knew
what
meeting
a
caravan
in
these
circumstances
meant
till
we
met
the
first
sixty
animals
each
laden
with
two
heavy
the
question
arises
who
is
to
give
way
and
who
is
to
drive
his
beasts
off
the
track
to
struggle
flounder
and
fall
in
three
feet
of
snow
not
to
get
up
again
without
being
unloaded
and
even
then
with
difficulty
the
rub
came
on
a
bank
near
a
stream
where
there
was
a
deep
drift
i
decided
to
give
way
but
nothing
would
induce
my
mule
to
face
the
snow
an
orderly
was
in
front
and
hadji
behind
down
the
track
came
sixty
animals
loaded
with
their
great
they
could
not
and
would
not
give
way
and
the
two
caravans
came
into
collision
there
were
mules
struggling
and
falling
loads
overturned
muleteers
yelling
and
roaring
hadji
groaning
god
help
us
my
mule
a
new
one
a
big
strong
animal
unused
to
a
bit
plunging
and
kicking
in
the
middle
of
a
free
fight
i
was
struck
hard
on
my
ankle
by
a
and
nearly
knocked
off
still
down
they
came
in
apparently
endless
hordes
my
mule
plunged
her
bridle
off
and
kicked
most
violently
there
were
yells
all
round
my
snow
spectacles
were
knocked
off
and
lost
then
came
another
smash
in
which
i
thought
a
bone
was
broken
fearing
that
i
should
be
laid
up
with
a
broken
limb
for
weeks
in
some
horrible
caravanserai
and
really
desperate
with
the
danger
and
confusion
i
called
over
and
over
again
to
hadji
to
get
off
and
pull
my
mule
into
the
snow
or
i
should
be
killed
he
did
not
stir
but
sat
dazed
on
his
pack
moaning
god
help
us
till
he
the
mule
and
the
load
were
rolled
over
in
the
drift
the
orderly
contrived
to
get
the
bridle
on
my
mule
and
to
back
his
own
in
front
of
me
and
as
each
irrepressible
animal
rolled
down
the
bank
he
gave
its
load
a
push
which
nicely
balanced
as
these
loads
are
made
it
swerve
and
saved
me
from
further
damage
hadji
had
rolled
off
four
times
previously
and
the
last
i
saw
of
him
at
that
time
and
of
the
caravan
was
a
man
five
mules
and
their
loads
buried
in
the
snow
the
personal
results
to
me
of
what
is
euphemistically
called
a
difficulty
are
my
blue
glasses
gone
a
number
of
bruises
a
and
a
bad
cut
which
bled
profusely
and
then
the
blood
froze
a
number
of
caravans
snowed
up
for
several
days
were
and
there
were
many
similar
encounters
and
donkeys
and
mules
falling
with
their
loads
and
rolling
into
the
deep
snow
and
coming
to
blows
over
the
if
a
donkey
is
forced
off
the
track
it
goes
down
at
once
i
unfortunately
caught
my
foot
in
the
pack
of
one
and
rolled
it
over
and
as
it
disappeared
in
the
snow
its
pack
and
saddle
fell
over
its
head
and
displayed
the
naked
vertebr√¶
of
its
poor
back
this
kirrind
valley
must
be
fully
twenty
miles
long
by
from
two
to
five
broad
but
there
was
only
one
village
inhabited
and
two
in
ruins
as
we
floundered
along
in
the
snow
with
our
jaded
animals
two
men
on
fine
horses
met
and
joined
us
sent
by
the
abdul
rahim
son
of
the
british
agent
at
kirmanshah
whose
guests
we
are
to
be
following
them
was
a
or
litter
for
me
a
wooden
box
with
two
side
doors
four
feet
high
six
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
at
each
end
are
long
shafts
and
between
each
pair
of
shafts
a
superb
mule
and
each
mule
has
a
man
to
lead
him
i
could
never
use
such
a
thing
except
in
case
of
a
broken
limb
but
i
am
very
grateful
to
abdul
rahim
for
sending
it
miles
the
temperature
fell
with
the
sun
the
snowy
hills
took
on
every
shade
of
rose
and
pink
and
in
a
universal
blush
of
tender
colouring
we
reached
kirrind
all
of
a
sudden
the
colour
died
out
the
sky
changed
to
and
pallid
wastes
of
unbroken
snow
stretching
into
the
gray
distance
made
a
glorious
winter
landscape
we
are
now
fairly
in
for
the
rigours
of
a
persian
winter
kirrind
the
capital
of
the
kirrind
kurds
is
either
grotesquely
or
picturesquely
situated
in
and
around
a
narrow
gap
in
a
range
of
lofty
hills
through
which
the
rushes
after
rising
in
a
spring
immediately
behind
the
gap
suggests
the
word
jaws
and
in
these
open
jaws
rise
one
above
another
houses
straggling
down
upon
the
plain
among
vineyards
poplars
willows
and
immense
walnuts
and
gardens
there
are
said
to
be
houses
but
many
of
them
are
ruinous
the
stream
which
bursts
from
the
hills
is
divided
into
innumerable
streamlets
which
must
clothe
these
gardens
with
beauty
a
riding
on
ahead
had
engaged
a
house
so
we
avoided
the
horrors
of
the
immense
caravanserai
crammed
with
caravans
the
house
is
rough
but
has
three
adjoining
rooms
and
the
servants
are
comfortable
a
fire
with
its
usual
accompaniment
of
stinging
smoke
fails
to
raise
the
temperature
of
my
room
to
the
yet
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
comfortable
and
employ
oneself
my
room
at
kirrind
was
very
cold
the
ink
froze
the
mercury
fell
to
below
zero
in
it
and
outside
in
the
sun
was
only
at
there
was
a
great
babel
at
starting
some
men
had
sold
four
chickens
for
the
high
price
of
each
the
current
price
being
and
had
robbed
the
servants
of
two
and
they
took
one
of
the
mules
which
was
sent
after
us
by
an
official
slipping
floundering
and
falling
in
the
deep
snow
and
getting
entangled
among
caravans
we
rode
all
day
over
rolling
levels
the
distance
seemed
interminable
over
the
glittering
plains
and
the
pain
and
stiffness
produced
by
the
intense
cold
were
hard
to
bear
and
it
was
not
possible
to
change
the
cramped
position
by
walking
the
mercury
fell
to
as
with
tired
animals
we
toiled
up
the
slope
on
which
harunabad
stands
a
very
large
caravanserai
and
a
village
of
sixty
houses
occupy
the
site
of
a
town
built
by
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
kerkhah
it
has
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
coldest
places
in
persia
so
cold
that
its
ilyat
inhabitants
desert
it
in
winter
leaving
two
or
three
men
who
make
a
business
of
supplying
caravans
usually
people
come
out
of
the
villages
in
numbers
as
we
arrive
but
we
passed
group
after
group
of
ruinous
hovels
without
seeing
a
creature
we
obtained
awfully
cold
rooms
at
a
great
height
above
a
bazar
now
deserted
i
write
awfully
advisedly
for
the
mercury
in
them
at
sunset
was
below
zero
the
floors
were
plaster
slippery
with
frozen
moisture
the
walls
were
partly
wood
with
great
apertures
between
the
planks
where
they
were
mud
the
blistered
plaster
was
fringed
with
icicles
later
the
mercury
sank
to
and
before
morning
to
below
zero
and
the
hot
water
froze
in
my
basin
before
i
could
use
it
we
were
to
have
started
at
eight
as
there
was
no
possible
way
of
dividing
the
nine
hours
march
but
when
the
time
came
the
said
it
was
too
cold
to
rope
the
loads
a
little
later
that
we
could
only
get
and
later
that
there
was
no
accommodation
for
mules
and
that
we
must
go
the
whole
way
at
nine
the
mercury
was
at
below
zero
and
the
slipperiness
was
fearful
the
poor
animals
could
scarcely
keep
on
their
feet
we
have
crossed
two
high
passes
nal
shikan
the
breaking
pass
and
the
charzabar
pass
in
tremendous
snow
riding
nine
hours
only
dismounting
to
walk
down
one
hill
at
the
hamlet
i
decided
to
go
on
having
still
a
lingering
prejudice
against
sharing
a
den
with
a
quantity
of
human
beings
mules
asses
poultry
and
dogs
on
one
long
ascent
we
encountered
a
blizzard
when
the
mercury
was
only
above
zero
it
was
awful
the
men
covered
their
heads
with
their
and
turned
their
backs
to
the
wind
i
got
my
heavy
mackintosh
over
everything
but
in
taking
off
three
pairs
of
gloves
for
one
minute
to
button
it
the
pain
of
my
hand
was
literally
excruciating
at
the
summit
the
snow
was
four
feet
deep
and
a
number
of
mules
were
down
but
after
getting
over
the
crest
of
the
nal
shikan
pass
and
into
the
zobeideh
valley
it
became
better
but
after
every
descent
there
was
another
ascent
to
face
till
we
reached
the
pass
above
the
torrent
in
a
picturesque
glen
with
a
village
and
some
primitive
flour
mills
below
this
height
lies
the
vast
and
fertile
plain
of
mahidasht
one
expanse
of
snow
broken
by
mud
villages
looking
like
brown
islands
and
the
truncated
cone
of
goree
a
seat
of
the
ancient
in
the
centre
of
the
plain
is
an
immense
caravanserai
with
some
houses
about
it
when
this
came
into
sight
it
was
only
five
miles
off
but
we
were
nearly
three
hours
in
reaching
it
the
view
was
wonderful
every
speck
on
the
vast
plain
was
seen
distinctly
then
came
a
heavy
snow
blink
above
which
hovered
ghosts
of
snow
mountains
rising
into
a
pale
green
sky
a
dead
and
lonely
wilderness
looking
as
if
all
things
which
lived
and
moved
had
long
ago
vanished
from
it
those
hours
after
first
sighting
the
village
were
very
severe
it
seemed
to
grow
no
nearer
i
was
with
the
journey
of
miles
at
a
slow
foot
pace
and
was
aching
and
cramped
from
the
intense
cold
for
as
twilight
fell
the
mercury
sank
to
below
zero
the
indian
servants
i
believe
suffered
more
than
i
did
and
some
of
the
even
more
than
they
at
last
by
a
pointed
brick
bridge
we
crossed
the
little
river
of
mahidasht
and
rode
into
the
house
of
the
headman
who
is
a
sort
of
steward
of
abdul
rahim
our
future
host
the
owner
of
many
villages
on
this
plain
the
house
is
of
the
better
class
of
kurdish
houses
with
a
broad
passage
and
a
room
on
each
side
at
the
end
a
great
low
dark
room
half
half
stable
which
accommodates
some
of
the
mules
the
muleteers
the
servants
and
the
men
of
the
family
beyond
this
again
is
a
large
stable
and
reached
by
a
sloping
tunnel
is
the
one
room
has
neither
door
nor
window
mine
has
an
outer
and
inner
door
and
a
fire
of
live
embers
in
a
hole
in
the
floor
the
family
in
vacating
the
room
have
left
their
goods
behind
two
plank
beds
at
one
end
heaped
with
carpets
and
felts
a
sacking
cradle
hanging
from
the
roof
two
clay
jars
five
feet
high
for
storing
grain
and
in
the
or
recesses
of
the
walls
or
pots
metal
vases
cartridge
belts
and
odds
and
ends
two
old
guns
an
old
sword
and
a
coarse
coloured
print
of
the
russian
imperial
family
are
on
the
wall
i
was
lifted
from
the
mule
to
my
bed
covered
with
all
available
wraps
a
pot
of
hot
embers
put
by
the
bed
my
hands
and
feet
rubbed
hot
syrup
coloured
with
tea
produced
in
russian
glasses
and
in
two
hours
i
was
able
to
move
the
caravan
which
we
thought
could
not
get
through
the
snow
came
in
three
hours
later
men
and
mules
thoroughly
knocked
up
and
not
till
nine
could
we
get
a
scanty
dinner
it
has
been
a
hard
day
all
round
the
in
the
kitchen
are
cursing
the
english
sahibs
who
will
travel
in
the
winter
wishing
our
fathers
may
be
burned
two
of
the
muleteers
have
been
howling
with
pain
for
the
last
two
hours
and
i
went
into
the
kitchen
to
see
the
poor
fellows
in
a
corner
of
the
big
room
among
the
rough
trunks
of
trees
which
support
the
sooty
roof
the
muleteers
were
lying
in
a
heap
in
their
felt
coats
round
a
big
fire
about
another
the
servants
were
cooking
their
food
the
were
lying
round
another
and
some
of
the
house
people
about
a
fourth
and
through
smoke
and
flame
a
background
of
mules
and
dogs
was
dimly
seen
a
gleam
now
and
then
falling
into
the
dark
stable
beyond
where
the
jaded
baggage
animals
were
lying
in
heaps
mahidasht
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
finest
and
most
fertile
plains
in
persia
miles
long
by
fifteen
broad
and
is
irrigated
throughout
by
a
small
stream
swarming
with
turtles
its
population
scattered
over
it
in
small
villages
is
estimated
probably
at
at
a
height
of
feet
the
winters
are
severe
the
snow
is
nearly
three
feet
deep
already
and
more
is
impending
the
mercury
in
my
room
fell
to
below
zero
before
midnight
but
rose
for
a
gray
cloudy
day
the
men
and
animals
were
so
done
up
that
we
could
not
start
till
nearly
eleven
the
march
though
not
more
than
sixteen
miles
was
severe
owing
to
the
deep
snow
and
cold
wind
five
miles
over
the
snowy
billows
of
the
mahidasht
plain
a
long
ascent
on
which
the
strong
north
wind
was
scarcely
bearable
a
succession
of
steep
and
tiresome
ridges
many
difficulties
in
passing
caravans
and
then
a
gradual
descent
down
a
long
wide
valley
opened
upon
the
high
plateau
on
which
kirmanshah
one
of
the
most
important
cities
in
persia
is
situated
trees
bare
and
gaunt
chiefly
poplars
rising
out
of
unsullied
snow
for
two
hours
before
we
reached
it
denoted
the
whereabouts
of
the
city
which
after
many
disappointments
bursts
upon
one
suddenly
the
view
from
the
hill
above
the
town
was
the
most
glorious
snow
view
i
ever
saw
all
around
rolled
to
a
great
height
smooth
as
the
icing
of
a
cake
hills
billowy
like
the
swell
of
the
pacific
after
a
storm
an
ocean
of
snow
below
them
a
plateau
equally
unsullied
on
the
east
side
of
which
rises
the
magnificently
precipitous
besitun
range
sublime
in
its
wintry
grandeur
while
on
the
distant
side
of
the
plateau
pink
peaks
raised
by
an
atmospheric
illusion
to
a
colossal
height
hovered
above
the
snow
blink
and
walled
in
the
picture
snow
was
in
the
air
snow
clouds
were
darkening
over
the
besitun
range
except
for
those
pink
peaks
there
were
no
atmospheric
effects
the
white
was
very
pallid
and
the
gray
was
very
black
no
illusions
were
possible
the
aspect
was
grim
desolate
and
ominous
and
even
before
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
descent
the
huge
peaks
and
rock
masses
of
besitun
were
blotted
out
by
swirls
of
snow
kirmanshah
approached
from
the
added
no
elements
of
picturesqueness
to
the
effect
a
ruinous
wall
much
too
large
for
the
shrunken
city
it
encloses
parts
of
it
lying
in
the
moat
some
ruinous
loopholed
towers
lines
of
small
domes
denoting
bazars
below
a
few
houses
rising
above
the
insignificant
mass
gardens
orchards
vineyards
and
poplars
stretching
up
the
southerly
hollow
behind
and
gardens
now
under
frozen
water
to
the
north
made
up
a
not
very
interesting
contrast
with
the
magnificence
of
nature
we
circled
much
of
the
ruinous
wall
on
thin
ice
turned
in
between
high
walls
and
up
an
alley
cumbered
with
snow
dismounted
at
a
low
door
were
received
by
a
number
of
servants
and
were
conducted
through
a
frozen
courtyard
into
a
room
with
divans
beside
a
blazing
fire
a
table
in
the
centre
covered
with
apples
oranges
and
sweetmeats
and
the
large
jubilee
photograph
of
queen
victoria
hanging
over
the
fireplace
footnotes
another
interest
however
is
its
connection
with
many
of
the
romantic
legends
still
told
of
khosroe
parviz
and
his
beautiful
queen
complicated
with
love
stories
concerning
the
sculptor
farhad
to
whom
the
persians
attribute
some
of
their
most
famous
rock
sculptures
one
of
the
most
romantic
of
these
legends
is
that
farhad
loved
shirin
and
that
khosroe
was
aware
of
it
and
promised
to
give
her
to
him
if
he
could
execute
the
impossible
task
of
bringing
to
the
city
the
abundant
waters
of
the
mountains
farhad
set
himself
to
the
herculean
labour
and
to
the
horror
of
the
king
nearly
accomplished
it
when
khosroe
dreading
the
advancing
necessity
of
losing
shirin
or
being
dishonoured
sent
to
inform
him
of
her
death
being
at
the
time
on
the
top
of
a
precipice
urging
on
the
work
of
the
aqueduct
the
news
filled
him
with
such
ungovernable
despair
that
he
threw
himself
down
and
was
killed
the
pashalik
of
zohab
now

fully
described

in
whose
absence
at
tihran
his
son
abdul
rahim
performs
the
duties
of
hospitality
in
a
most
charming
manner
as
if
though
a
very
busy
man
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
carry
out
the
wishes
of
his
guests
his
hospitality
is
most
unobtrusive
also
and
considerate
if
such
a
wish
is
expressed
as
to
visit
the
sculptures
of
the

anything

everything
is
quietly
and
beautifully
arranged

superb

the

history
as
usually
told
is
an
interesting
one
they
are
arabs
and
the
grandfather
of
our
host
hadji
khalil
was
a
trusted
in
the
employment
of
sir
henry
rawlinson
and
saved
his
life
when
he
fell
from
a
scaffolding
while
copying
the
besitun
inscriptions
his
good
qualities
and
an
honesty
of
character
and
purpose
rare
among
orientals
eventually
placed
him
in
the
important
position
of
british
here
and
he
became
a
british
subject
and
was
succeeded
in
his
position
by
his
son
agha
hassan
who
is
now
by
virtue
of
singular
business
capacities
the
wealthiest
man
in
this
province
and
possibly
in
persia
and
bears
the
very
highest
character
for
trustworthiness
and
honour
abdul
rahim
is
a
very
man
with
noticeable
eyes
very
large
and
prominent
he
has
a
strong
sense
of
humour
which
flits
over
his
face
in
an
amused
smile
he
and
his
father
are
very
large
landowners
and
are
always
adding
land
to
land
and
are
now
the
owners
of
the
magnificent
sculptures
and
of
the
they
are
bankers
likewise
and
merchants
on
a
large
scale

have
built
a
very
fine

great

travels
driving
to
tihran
and
back
in
an
english
landau
with
four
horses
and
a
number
of
outriders
and
attendants
and
his
son
entertains
visitors
in
the
same
way
mounting
even
the
outriders
and
on
arabs
when
he
walks
in
the
city
it
is
like
a
royal
progress
everybody
bows
low
nearly
to
the
ground
and
his
follows
distributing
alms
among
the
poor
i
mention
all
this
because
it
is
a
marvel
in
persia
where
a
reputation
for
wealth
is
the
last
thing
a
rich
man
desires
to
elevate
a
gateway
or
to
give
any
external
sign
of
affluence
is
to
make
himself
a
mark
for
the
official
rapacity
which
spares
none
the
policy
is
to
let
a
man
grow
quietly
rich
to
let
the
sheep
wool
grow
but
as
soon
as
he
shows
any
enjoyment
of
wealth
to
deprive
him
of
his
gains
according
to
a
common
persian
expression
he
is
ripe
he
must
be
squeezed
the
and
his
son
are
the
only
men
here
who
are
not
afraid
to
show
their
wealth
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
can
not
be
touched
because
they
are
british
subjects
they
can
neither
be
robbed
squeezed
nor
mulcted
beyond
the
legitimate
taxation
by
persian
officials
and
are
able
to
protect
the
property
of
others
when
it
is
entrusted
to
their
keeping
british
protection
has
been
in
fact
the
making
of
these
men
the
is
simple
the
is
across
the
frozen
courtyard
the
meals
are
served
in
european
fashion
the
being
an
ancient
man
born
in
the
house
who
occasionally
inserts
a
remark
into
the
conversation
or
helps
his
master
memory
the
interpreter
sits
on
the
floor
during
meals
i
breakfast
in
my
room
but
lunch
and
dine
with
our
host
who
spends
the
evening
in
the
sherbet
is
provided
instead
of
wine
abdul
rahim
places
me
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
i
am
served
first
the
interpreting
is
from
persian
into
hindustani
and
our
host
expresses
almost
daily
regret
that
he
can
not
talk
with
me
on
politics
kirmanshah
which
is
said
to
be
a
favourable
specimen
of
a
persian
town
is
absolutely
hideous
and
uninteresting
it
is
really
half
in
ruins
it
has
suffered
terribly
from
plague
pestilence
and
famine
and
from
the
awful
rapacity
of
governors
it
once
had
houses
but
the
highest
estimate
of
its
present
population
is
so
severely
have
the
town
and
province
been
oppressed
that
some
years
ago
of
the
inhabitants
migrated
the
peasants
into
turkey
and
the
townspeople
into
the
northern
province
of
azerbijan
if
a
governor
pays
to
the
shah
for
an
appointment
of
which
he
may
be
deprived
any
day
it
can
scarcely
be
expected
of
oriental
or
indeed
of
any
human
nature
that
he
will
not
make
a
good
thing
of
it
while
he
has
it
and
squeeze
all
he
can
out
of
the
people
the
streets
are
very
narrow
and
look
narrower
just
now
because
the
snow
is
heaped
almost
to
the
top
of
the
mud
walls
which
are
not
broken
up
as
in
turkish
towns
by
projecting
lattice
windows
but
are
absolutely
blank
with
the
exception
of
entrances
to
the
courtyards
within
closed
by
heavy
unpainted
wooden
doors
studded
with
wooden
nails
the
causeways
on
which
but
for
the
heaps
of
slippery
snow
two
men
might
walk
abreast
have
a
ditch
two
or
three
feet
wide
between
them
which
is
the
roadway
for
animals
there
are
some
open
spaces
abounding
in
ruinous
heaps
others
where
goods
are
unloaded
surrounded
with
warehouses
immense
brick
bazars
with
domed
roofs
a
citadel
or
where
the
governor
lives
a
large
parade
ground
and
barracks
for
men
mosques
of
no
pretensions
public
baths
caravanserais
brick
warehouses
behind
the
bazars
public
gardens
with
fountains
and
avenues
of
poplars
a
prison
and
some
good
houses
like
this
one
hidden
behind
high
mud
walls
although
the
snow
kindly
veils
a
good
deal
of
deformity
the
city
impresses
one
as
ruinous
and
decayed
yet
it
has
a
large
trade
and
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
prosperous
places
in
the
empire
the
bazars
are
spacious
and
well
stocked
with
european
goods
especially
with
manchester
cottons
of
colours
and
patterns
suited
to
oriental
taste
which
loves
carnation
red
there
are
many
jews
otherwise
the
people
are
shiah
moslems
with
an
increasing
admixture
of
the
secret
sect
of
the
in
some
respects
the
shiahs
are
more
fanatical
than
the
sunnis
as
for
instance
it
is
quite
possible
to
visit
a
mosque
in
turkey
but
here
a
christian
is
not
allowed
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
outer
gate
certain
customs
are
also
more
rigidly
observed
a
persian
woman
would
be
in
danger
of
death
from
the
mob
if
she
appeared
unveiled
in
the
streets
when
i
walked
through
the
town
though
attended
by
a
number
of
men
the
begged
me
to
exchange
my
gauze
veil
for
a
mask
and
even
when
i
showed
this
deference
to
custom
the
passing
through
the
bazars
was
very
unpleasant
the
men
being
decidedly
rude
and
inclined
to
hoot
and
use
bad
language
even
the
touch
of
a
christian
is
regarded
as
polluting
and
i
nearly
got
into
trouble
by
handling
a
mistaking
it
for
a
piece
of
felt
the
bazars
are
not
magnificent
no
rich
carpets
or
other
goods
are
exposed
to
view
for
fear
of
exactions
a
buyer
wanting
such
things
must
send
word
privately
and
have
them
brought
to
his
house
justice
seems
to
be
here
much
as
in
turkey
a
marketable
commodity
which
the
working
classes
are
too
poor
to
buy
a
man
may
be
kept
in
prison
because
he
is
too
poor
to
get
out
but
justice
is
usually
summary
and
men
are
not
imprisoned
for
long
terms
if
prisoners
have
friends
the
friends
feed
them
if
not
they
depend
on
charity
and
charity
is
a
moslem
virtue
there
is
no
prison
here
for
women
they
are
punished
by
having
their
heads
shaved
and
by
being
taken
through
the
town
on
asses
various
forms
of
torture
are
practised
such
as
burning
with
hot
irons
the
bastinado
and
squeezing
the
fingers
in
a
vice
the
bastinado
is
also
most
extensively
used
as
a
punishment
yesterday
by
appointment
we
were
received
by
the
governor
of
the
province
riding
through
the
slippery
alleys
is
not
what
europeans
would
think
of
and
our
host
with
his
usual
courtesy
humoured
the
caprice
by
walking
with
us
himself
preceded
by
six
lit
and
followed
by
his
casting
money
to
the
poor
and
a
train
of
servants
the
citadel
or
governor
residence
like
all
else
is
forlorn
dirty
and
ruinous
in
its
approaches
which
are
long
vaulted
corridors
capable
of
much
adornment
crowds
of
soldiers
dervishes
and
others
were
there
to
see
the
visit
which
was
one
of
ceremony
the
palace
and
government
offices
are
buildings
arranged
round
a
large
with
trees
and
fountains
two
little
fellows
in
scarlet
uniform
were
at
the
entrance
and
the
lobby
upstairs
was
crowded
with
persian
and
negro
servants
all
in
high
black
lambskin
caps
tight
black
trousers
and
tight
coats
with
full
skirts
the
governor
received
us
in
a
very
large
lofty
room
and
shook
hands
i
never
saw
a
human
being
more
nearly
like
an
ape
in
appearance
and
a
loud
giggle
added
to
the
resemblance
this
giggle
and
a
fatuous
manner
are
possibly
assumed
for
he
has
the
widespread
reputation
of
being
a
very
able
man
shrewd
in
business
and
officially
rapacious
as
was
his
father
before
him
the
grotesque
figure
not
more
than
five
feet
high
was
dressed
in
a
black
astrakan
cap
a
coat
of
fine
buff
russian
kerseymere
with
full
skirts
and
tight
trousers
of
the
same
and
an
of
rich
kerman
silk
brocade
edged
with
costly
fur
he
made
a
few
curt
remarks
to
his
foreign
guests
and
then
turned
to
abdul
rahim
and
discussed
local
affairs
for
the
remainder
of
a
very
long
visit
a
table
covered
with
sweetmeats
was
produced
and
we
were
regaled
with
tea
la
in
russian
glasses
and
then
young
diminutive
soldiers
in
scarlet
coats
and
scarlet
trousers
with
blue
stripes
marched
into
the
courtyard
and
stood
disconsolately
in
the
snow
and
two
bands
brayed
and
shrieked
for
an
hour
then
were
smoked
and
coffee
was
handed
round
the
cups
being
in
gold
filigree
holders
incrusted
with
turquoises
this
was
the
welcome
signal
for
the
termination
of
a
very
tedious
visit
the
is
a
dismal
combination
of
persian
and
european
taste
invariably
a
failure
the
carpets
are
magnificent
but
the
curtains
are
common
serge
bordered
with
white
cotton
lace
and
the
with
its
costly
equipments
was
covered
with
a
tawdry
cretonne
cover
edged
with
some
inferior
black
cotton
lace
the
lofty
walls
of
plain
plaster
of
paris
have
their
simplicity
destroyed
by
some
french
girandoles
with
wax
grapes
hanging
from
them
the
governor
returned
the
visit
arriving
on
horseback
with
fully
forty
mounted
attendants
and
was
received
in
a
glass
room
on
the
roof
furnished
with
divans
tables
covered
with
beautiful
confectionery
and
tea
and
coffee
equipages
the
conversation
was
as
local
as
yesterday
in
spite
of
our
host
courteous
efforts
to
include
the
strangers
in
it
the
governor
asked
if
i
were
going
to
tihran
to
be
to
the
shah
which
our
host
says
is
the
rumour
in
kirmanshah
during
such
visits
there
are
crowds
of
attendants
in
the
room
all
the
time
pouring
out
tea
filling
and
washing
cups
on
the
floor
and
as
any
guest
may
be
a
spy
and
an
enemy
the
conversation
is
restricted
to
exaggerated
compliments
and
superficial
remarks
everything
is
regulated
by
an
elaborate
code
of
etiquette
even
the
compliments
are
meted
out
by
rule
and
to
give
a
man
more
than
he
is
entitled
to
is
understood
to
be
intended
as
sarcasm
the
number
of
bows
made
by
the
entertainer
the
distance
he
advances
to
meet
his
guest
and
the
position
in
which
he
seats
him
are
matters
of
careful
calculation
and
the
slightest
mistake
in
any
particular
is
liable
to
be
greatly
resented
by
a
superior
the
persian
is
a
most
ceremonious
being
like
the
japanese
he
is
trained
from
infancy
to
the
etiquette
of
his
class
and
besides
the
etiquette
of
class
there
is
here
the
etiquette
of
religion
which
is
far
more
strict
than
in
turkey
and
yields
only
when
there
is
daily
contact
as
in
the
capital
between
moslems
and
christians
thus
a
moslem
will
not
accept
refreshments
from
a
christian
and
he
will
not
smoke
a
pipe
after
a
christian
even
if
he
is
his
guest
and
of
equal
or
higher
rank
the
custom
is
for
a
visitor
as
in
the
case
of
the
governor
to
announce
his
visit
previously
and
he
and
his
train
are
met
when
he
is
the
superior
by
a
mounted
servant
of
the
recipient
of
the
honour
who
precedes
him
to
the
door
where
the
servants
are
arranged
according
to
their
rank
and
the
host
waits
to
take
his
hand
and
lead
him
to
a
seat
on
entering
the
room
a
persian
knows
at
once
what
place
he
ought
to
take
and
it
is
rare
for
such
a
as
that
referred
to
in
luke
xiv
to
occur
refreshments
and
pipes
are
served
at
regulated
intervals
and
the
introduction
of
a
third
cup
of
tea
or
coffee
and
a
third
is
the
signal
for
the
guest
to
retire
but
it
is
necessary
to
ask
and
receive
permission
to
do
so
and
elaborate
forms
of
speech
regulated
by
the
rank
of
the
visitor
are
used
on
the
occasion
if
he
is
of
equal
or
superior
rank
the
host
bowing
profoundly
replies
that
he
can
have
no
other
wish
than
that
of
his
guest
that
the
house
has
been
purified
by
his
presence
that
the
announcement
of
the
visit
brought
good
luck
to
the
house
that
his
headache
or
toothache
has
been
cured
by
his
arrival
and
these
flowery
compliments
escort
the
ordinary
guest
to
the
door
but
if
he
be
of
superior
rank
the
host
walks
in
advance
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
repeats
the
compliments
there
the
etiquette
concerning
pipes
is
most
elaborate
are
invariably
used
among
the
rich
the
great
man
brings
his
own
and
his
own
the
is
a
water
pipe
and
whatever
its
form
the
principle
is
the
same
the
smoke
being
conducted
to
the
bottom
of
a
liberal
supply
of
water
to
be
sucked
up
in
bubbles
through
it
with
a
gurgling
noise
as
in
the
indian
this
is
of
plain
or
cut
glass
with
a
wide
mouth
the
as
in
the
case
of
the
governor
pipe
is
often
a
work
of
high
art
in
thin
gold
chased
engraved
decorated
with
work
or
incrusted
with
turquoises
or
ornamented
with
rich
enamel
very
costly
or
even
being
paid
by
rich
men
for
the
decoration
of
a
single
between
this
and
the
is
a
wooden
tube
about
fourteen
inches
long
from
one
end
of
which
an
inner
tube
passes
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
tube
admits
the
flexible
smoking
tube
more
used
in
turkey
than
in
persia
or
the
wooden
stem
about
eighteen
inches
long
the
is
lined
with
clay
and
plaster
of
paris
besides
these
there
is
the
to
prevent
the
fire
from
falling
or
becoming
too
hot
usually
of
silver
with
dependent
silver
chains
and
four
or
six
silver
or
gold
chains
terminating
in
flat
balls
hang
from
the
the
is
one
of
the
greatest
institutions
of
persia
no
man
stirs
without
it
and
as
its
decoration
gives
an
idea
of
a
social
position
immense
sums
are
lavished
upon
it
and
the
is
a
most
important
person
the
lighting
is
troublesome
and
after
all
there
seems
much
ado
about
nothing
for
a
few
whiffs
exhaust
its
capacities
the
tobacco
called
which
is
smoked
in
is
exceptionally
poisonous
it
can
not
be
used
the
first
year
and
improves
with
age
being
preserved
in
bags
sewn
up
in
raw
hide
unless
it
is
moistened
it
produces
alarming
vertigo
when
the
is
required
about
of
an
ounce
is
moistened
squeezed
like
a
sponge
and
packed
in
the
and
morsels
of
live
charcoal
if
possible
made
from
the
root
of
the
vine
are
laid
upon
it
and
blown
into
a
strong
flame
the
takes
two
or
three
draws
and
with
an
obeisance
hands
it
with
much
solemnity
to
his
master
abdul
rahim
smokes
three
or
four
pipes
every
evening
and
coffee
served
with
the
last
is
the
signal
for
his
departure
a
guest
if
he
does
not
bring
his
own
pipe
and
has
a
offered
to
him
but
if
the
host
be
of
higher
rank
any
one
but
an
ignoramus
refuses
it
till
he
has
smoked
first
if
under
such
circumstances
a
guest
incautiously
accepts
it
he
is
invariably
mortified
by
seeing
it
sent
into
the
to
be
cleaned
and
refilled
before
his
superior
will
smoke
if
it
be
proper
for
him
to
take
it
he
offers
it
in
order
of
rank
to
all
present
but
takes
good
care
that
none
accept
it
till
he
has
enjoyed
it
after
which
the
attendant
passes
it
round
according
to
rank
in
cases
of
only
one
and
several
guests
they
smoke
in
order
of
position
but
each
one
must
pay
the
compliment
of
suggesting
that
some
one
else
should
smoke
before
himself
the
etiquette
of
smoking
is
most
rigid
i
heard
of
a
case
here
in
which
a
who
objected
to
smoke
after
a
european
offered
it
to
one
after
he
had
smoked
it
himself
so
gross
a
piece
of
impertinence
that
the
other
called
the
saying
you
can
break
that
pipe
to
pieces
and
burn
the
stick
i
do
not
care
to
smoke
it
upon
which
the
knowing
that
his
violation
of
etiquette
merited
this
sharp
rebuke
turned
pale
and
replied
you
say
truly
i
have
eaten
dirt
the
lower
classes
smoke
a
coarse
turkish
tobacco
or
a
persian
mild
sort
looking
like
whitish
sawdust
which
is
merely
the
pounded
leaf
stalk
and
stem
the
pipe
they
use
and
carry
in
their
girdles
has
a
small
iron
brass
or
clay
head
and
a
straight
stick
with
a
very
wide
bore
and
no
mouthpiece
and
it
is
not
placed
in
the
teeth
but
is
merely
held
between
the
lips
smoking
seems
a
necessity
rather
than
a
luxury
in
persia
and
is
one
of
the
great
features
of
social
life
kirmanshah
is
famous
for
its
rugs
as
carpets
are
called
in
this
country
there
are
from
to
thirty
kinds
with
their
specific
names
aniline
dyes
have
gone
far
to
ruin
this
manufacture
but
their
import
is
now
prohibited
a
persian
would
not
look
at
the
carpets
loosely
woven
and
with
long
pile
which
are
made
for
the
european
market
and
are
bought
just
now
from
the
weavers
at
the
square
yard
a
carpet
according
to
persian
notions
must
be
of
fast
colours
fine
pile
scarcely
longer
than
utrecht
velvet
and
ready
to
last
at
least
a
century
a
rug
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
reached
its
prime
or
artistic
mellowness
of
tint
till
it
has
been
down
for
ten
years
the
permanence
of
the
dyes
is
tested
by
rubbing
the
rug
with
a
wet
cloth
when
the
worthless
colours
at
once
come
off
among
the
real
good
old
persian
carpets
there
are
very
few
patterns
though
colouring
and
borders
vary
considerably
a
good
carpet
if
new
is
always
stiff
the
ends
when
doubled
should
meet
evenly
there
must
be
no
creases
or
any
signs
on
the
wrong
side
of
darning
or
having
been
resorted
to
for
taking
out
creases
and
there
must
be
no
blue
in
the
white
cotton
finish
at
the
ends
carpets
with
much
white
are
prized
as
the
white
becomes
primrose
a
colour
which
wears
well
our
host
has
given
me
a
rug
of
the
oldest
persian
pattern
on
a
white
ground
very
thin
and
fine
large
patterns
and
thick
wool
are
comparatively
cheap
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
say
what
carpets
sell
at
for
if
one
has
been
made
by
a
family
and
poverty
presses
it
may
be
sold
much
under
value
or
if
it
is
a
good
one
and
they
can
hold
on
they
may
force
a
carpet
fancier
to
give
a
very
high
price
from
what
abdul
rahim
says
the
price
varies
from
to
a
square
yard
the
larger
carpets
about
fourteen
feet
by
eight
feet
selling
for
abdul
rahim
took
me
to
see
a
process
carried
on
in
houses
hovels
and
tents
by
women
and
children
the
machinery
is
portable
and
marvellously
simple
merely
two
upright
beams
fixed
in
the
floor
with
a
near
the
top
and
bottom
round
which
the
stout
cotton
or
woollen
threads
which
are
the
basis
of
the
carpet
are
stretched
the
wools
are
cut
in
short
lengths
and
are
knotted
round
two
threads
according
to
the
pattern
which
however
elaborate
the
weaver
usually
carries
in
her
head
after
a
few
inches
have
been
woven
in
this
simple
way
the
right
side
is
combed
and
the
superfluous
length
cut
off
with
rough
scissors
nothing
can
be
more
simple
than
the
process
or
more
beautiful
than
the
result
the

the
women
pursue
this
work
chiefly
in
odds
and
ends
of
time
and
in
some
cases
make
it
much
of
a
pastime
men
being
present
they
were
very
closely
veiled
and
found
great
difficulty
in
holding
on
the
and
knotting
the
wool
at
the
same
time
after
taking
tea
in
the
pleasant
upper
room
of
the
house
we
visited
the
large
barracks
and
parade
ground
the
appearance
of
the
soldiers
could
not
possibly
impress
a
stranger
favourably
they
looked
nothing
better
than
dirty
slouching
ragamuffins
slipshod
in
tattered
and
clothes
of
all
sorts
on
the
verge
of
actual
mendicancy
bits
of
rusty
uniform
appearing
here
and
there
amongst
their
cotton
rags
the
quarters
are
not
bad
the
rank
and
file
get
one
and
a
half
pounds
of
bread
daily
and
five
rupees
a
month
nominally
but
their
pay
is
in
arrears
and
they
eke
it
out
by
working
at
different
trades
these
men
had
not
been
drilled
for
two
months
and
were
slovenly
and
unsoldierly
to
a
degree
as
men
must
be
who
have
no
proper
pay
rations
instruction
clothing
or
equipments
the
courtesy
of
the
host
leaves
nothing
unthought
of
in
returning
from
a
long
stroll
round
the
city
a
wet
place
had
to
be
crossed
and
when
we
reached
it
there
were
ready
on
arriving
at
dusk
in
the
bazar
several
servants
met
us
with
lanterns
the
lantern
is
an
important
matter
as
its
size
is
supposed
to
indicate
the
position
of
the
wearer
the
persian
lantern
has
a
tin
or
iron
top
and
bottom
between
which
is
a
collapsible
wired
cylinder
of
waxed
muslin
the
light
from
the
candle
burning
inside
is
diffused
and
soft
three
feet
long
and
two
feet
wide
is
not
an
uncommon
size
they
are
carried
close
to
the
ground
illustrating
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
path
and
none
but
the
poor
stir
out
after
dark
without
a
in
front
our
lanterns
as
befits
the
position
are
very
large
there
is
something
biblical
in
the
progress
of
abdul
rahim
through
the
streets
always
reminding
me
of
greetings
in
the
and
doing
alms
to
be
seen
of
men
not
that
i
think
our
kind
host
sins
in
either
direction
peace
be
with
you
say
the
people
bending
low
to
you
be
peace
replies
the
agha
a
wish
having
been
expressed
to
visit
the
of
the
a
winter
picnic
was
quietly
arranged
for
the
purpose
there
was
a
great
snowstorm
on
the
night
we
arrived
succeeded
by
intense
frost
and
clear
blue
skies
glorious
canadian
winter
weather
outside
the
wall
an
english
landau
brought
in
pieces
from
baghdad
awaited
us
with
four
arab
horses
two
of
them
ridden
there
were
eleven
outriders
and
some
led
horses
and
a
turki
rode
alongside
the
carriage
with
two
cylinders
of
leather
containing
in
place
of
holsters
on
one
side
behind
a
leather
and
on
the
other
a
brazier
of
lighted
charcoal
hanging
by
chains
much
below
the
horse
body
another
lighted
the
at
intervals
and
handed
it
into
the
carriage
to
his
master
some
of
the
horsemen
carried
rifles
and
wore
reaching
the
karasu
river
we
got
out
into
deep
mud
were
ferried
over
in
a
muddy
box
hauling
on
a
rope
and
drove
to
the
where
several
tanks
of
clear
water
a
house
built
into
the
rock
a
number
of
kurds
on
fine
horses
the
arched
recesses
in
the
rock
which
contain
the
sculptures
and
the
magnificent
range
of
the
formed
a
very
striking
scene
sir
rawlinson
considers
these
sculptures
the
finest
in
persia
and
regards
them
as
the
work
of
greek
artists
the
lower
of
the
two
at
the
back
of
the
main
recess
is
a
colossal
figure
of
a
king
on
horseback
the
staff
of
whose
spear
is
as
a
weaver
beam
on
the
sides
of
the
recess
and
like
the
equestrian
figure
in
very
high
relief
and
very
much
undercut
are
scenes
from
the
chase
of
a
most
spirited
description
representing
a
king
and
court
mounted
on
elephants
horses
and
camels
hunting
boars
stags
and
other
animals
their
enthusiasm
in
the
pursuit
being
successfully
conveyed
by
the
art
of
the
sculptor
in
the
spandrels
of
the
archway
of
the
main
recess
are
carved
winged
female
figures
in
the
smaller
arch
also
containing
a
is
a
pehlevi
inscription
there
is
a
broad
stone
platform
in
front
of
the
arch
below
which
flows
direct
from
the
mountain
a
great
volume
of
water
which
replenishes
the
tanks
the
house
which
also
contains
a
tank
fed
by
the
same
living
water
the
mountain
and
its
treasures
the
tanks
and
some
miles
of
avenues
of
willows
have
been
bought
by
the
and
his
son
laughingly
says
that
he
hopes
to
live
to
see
a
time
when
cook
will
give
tourist
excursion
tickets
by
rail
to
the
coffee
and
were
served
to
the
kurds
in
the
arch
and
mounting
the
horses
we
rode
to
a
country
house
belonging
to
our
host
in
the
midst
of
large
rose
gardens
and
with
a
wonderful
view
of
the
magnificent
besitun
range
of
the
rolling
snowy
hills
on
which
kirmanshah
and
its
plantations
lay
like
a
black
splotch
and
of
this
noble
plain
six
miles
long
from
north
to
south
and
thirty
from
east
to
west
its
absolutely
unbroken
snow
gleaming
like
satin
and
shadows
lying
upon
it
in
pure
blue
many
servants
and
a
large
fire
awaited
us
in
that
pleasant
bungalow
as
well
as
coffee
and
sweetmeats
and
we
stayed
there
till
the
sinking
sun
flushed
all
the
surrounding
hills
with
pink
and
the
gray
twilight
came
on
i
rode
a
splendid
arab
with
a
neck
clothed
with
thunder
a
horse
to
make
one
feel
young
again
with
his
elastic
stride
and
pride
of
bearing
but
indeed
i
snatched
a
fearful
joy
for
the
snow
was
extremely
slippery
and
thirteen
arab
horses
in
high
condition
restrained
to
a
foot
pace
had
belligerent
views
of
their
own
tending
to
disconcert
an
unwary
rider
we
crossed
the
karasu
by
a
deep
and
devious
ford
up
to
the
girths
and
had
an
exhilarating
six
ride
by
moonlight
in
keen
frost
the
powdery
snow
crackling
under
the
horses
feet
it
was
too
slippery
to
enter
the
town
on
horseback
but
servants
with
lanterns
awaited
us
at
the
gates
and
roaring
fires
and
dinner
were
ready
here
after
a
delightful
expedition
i
dined
alone
with
our
host
hadji
who
understands
and
speaks
english
fairly
well
acting
as
interpreter
abdul
rahim
at
once
plunged
into
politics
and
asked
very
many
intelligent
questions
about
english
politics
and
parties
the
condition
and
housing
of
our
working
classes
and
then
about
my
own
family
and
occupations
he
is
a
zealous
moslem
and
the
pious
phrases
which
sit
so
oddly
on
hadji
come
very
naturally
from
his
lips
in
reply
to
a
sketch
of
character
which
i
gave
him
he
said
what
god
does
is
good
he
knows
we
submit
he
of
whom
you
speak
laid
up
great
treasure
for
another
life
whoso
loves
and
befriends
the
poor
is
acceptable
to
god
one
day
we
shall
know
all
god
is
good
he
said
he
had
been
too
busy
to
learn
english
but
that
he
understands
a
great
deal
and
added
with
a
roguish
gleam
lighting
up
his
whole
face
and
a
very
funny
laugh
and
i
hear
what
m
says
he
has
seen
but
very
few
english
ladies
and
it
shows
great
quickness
of
apprehension
that
he
should
never
fail
in
the
respectfulness
and
quiet
courteous
attentions
which
would
be
shown
to
a
lady
by
an
english
host
even
after
india
the
quantity
of
servants
employed
in
such
a
household
as
this
is
very
impressive
besides
a
number
who
are
with
the
in
tihran
there
are
the
or
steward
who
under
the
master
is
supreme
cooks
and
their
assistants
table
servants
who
are
sweepers
and
in
any
number
coffee
and
washermen
who
are
also
a
head
groom
with
a
groom
for
each
horse
under
him
and
a
number
more
over
forty
in
all
receiving
if
paid
at
the
usual
rate
of
wages
in
kirmanshah
which
is
a
cheap
place
from
sixty
a
month
down
to
twenty
the
being
now
about
these
wages
do
not
represent
the
actual
gains
of
a
servant
for
he
is
entitled
to
perquisites
which
are
chiefly
in
the
form
of
commissions
on
things
bought
and
sold
by
his
master
and
which
are
regarded
as
legitimate
if
they
do
not
exceed
per
cent
it
is
of
no
use
to
fight
again
this
or
to
vex
one
soul
in
any
way
about
it
persians
have
to
submit
to
it
as
well
as
europeans
hadji
has
endeavoured
to
extract
from
to
per
cent
on
purchases
made
by
him
for
me
but
this
is
thought
an
outrage
this
applies
to
all
bargains
if
a
no
longer
a
is
hired
he
has
to
pay
one
servant
per
cent
on
the
contract
price
if
i
sell
a
horse
my
servant
holds
out
for
a
good
price
and
takes
his
per
cent
and
the
same
thing
applies
to
a
pair
of
shoes
or
a
pound
of
tea
or
a
chicken
or
a
bottle
of
milk
the
system
comes
down
from
the
highest
quarters
the
price
paid
by
the
governor
of
a
province
to
the
shah
is
but
the
shah
and
when
a
governor
farms
the
taxes
for
and
sells
them
for
the
difference
is
his
and
so
it
goes
on
through
all
official
transactions
and
appointments
and
is
a
fruitful
source
of
grinding
oppression
and
of
inefficiency
in
the
army
and
other
departments
the
servant
poor
fellow
may
stop
at
per
cent
but
the
shah
servant
may
think
himself
generous
if
he
hesitates
at
per
cent
i
have
heard
it
said
that
when
the
late
shah
was
dying
he
said
to
the
present
sovereign
if
you
would
sit
long
upon
the
throne
see
that
there
is
only
one
spoon
among
ten
men
and
that
the
system
represented
by
this
speech
is
faithfully
carried
out
footnotes
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
agha
hassan
at
the
british
legation
at
tihran
he
is
charming
both
in
appearance
and
manner
a
specimen
of
the
highest
type
of
arab
good
breeding
with
a
courteous
kindliness
and
grace
of
manner
and
is
said
to
have
made
a
very
favourable
impression
when
he
went
to
england
lately
to
be
made
a
both
father
and
son
wear
the
arab
dress
in
plain
colours
but
rich
materials
with
very
large
white
turbans
of
damascus
embroidery
in
gold
silk
and
speak
only
arabic
and
persian
a
journey
of
nine
months
in
persia
chiefly
in
the
west
and
convinced
me
that
this
aspect
of
ruin
and
decay
is
universal
the
reader
curious
as
to
this
and
other
customs
of
modern
persia
should
read
wills
book
land

the
lion
and
the
a
rug
only
eight
feet
by
five
feet
was
given
me
by
a
persian
in
tihran
which
was
valued
for
duty
at
erzerum
at
the
square
yard
with
the
option
of
selling
it
to
the
at
that
price
which
implies
that
its
value
is
from
to

it
has
a
very
close

as

and
fine
as

letter
vi
kirmanshah
on
january
there
was
a
tremendous
snowfall
and
even
before
that
the
road
to
hamadan
which
was
our
possible
route
had
been
blocked
for
some
days
the
temperature
has
now
risen
to
with
a
bitter
wind
and
much
snow
in
the
sky
the
journey
does
not
promise
well
two
of
the
servants
have
been
ill
i
am
not
at
all
well
and
the
reports
of
the
difficulties
farther
on
are
rather
serious
these
things
are
certain
that
the
marches
are
very
long
and
without
any
possibility
of
resting
owing
to
mud
or
snow
and
that
the
food
and
accommodation
will
be
horrible
hadji
is
turning
out
very
badly
he
has
fever
now
poor
fellow
and
is
even
more
useless
than
usual
abdul
rahim
does
not
like
him
to
interpret
and
calls
him
the
savage
he
does
no
work
and
is
both
dirty
and
dishonest
the
constant
use
of
pious
phrases
is
not
a
good
sign
either
of
moslem
or
christian
i
told
him
this
morning
that
i
could
not
eat
from
so
dirty
a
plate
god
is
great
he
quietly
answered
he
broke
my
trestle
bed
by
not
attending
to
directions
and
when
i
pointed
out
what
he
had
done
he
answered
god
knows
all
god
ordains
all
things
it
is
really
exasperating
it
is
necessary
to
procure
an
additional
outfit
for
the
journey
a
slow
process
masks
lined
with
flannel
sheepskin
bags
for
the
feet
the
thick
felt
coats
of
the
country
for
all
the
servants
additional
blankets
for
me
and
the
marches
will
frequently
be
from
twenty
to
thirty
miles
in
length
and
the
fatigue
of
riding
them
at
a
foot
pace
when
one
can
not
exchange
riding
for
walking
will
be
so
great
that
i
have
had
a
pair
of
made
in
which
to
travel
when
i
am
tired
of
the
mule
these
panniers
are
oblong
wooden
boxes
eighteen
inches
high
with
hoops
over
them
for
curtains
one
hangs
on
each
side
of
the
mule
on
a
level
with
his
back
and
they
are
mounted
they
are
scrambled
into
from
the
front
by
a
ladder
which
is
carried
between
them
most
women
and
some
men
travel
in
them
they
are
filled
up
with
quilts
and
cushions
the
mule
which
is
to
carry
them
is
a
big
and
powerful
animal
and
double
price
is
charged
for
him
horses
are
very
good
and
cheap
here
a
pure
arab
can
be
bought
for
and
a
cross
between
an
arab
and
a
kurdish
horse
a
breed
noted
for
endurance
for
even
less
but
to
our
thinking
they
are
small
never
exceeding
fifteen
hands
the
horses
of
the
kirmanshah
province
are
esteemed
everywhere
and
there
is
a
steady
drain
upon
them
for
the
indian
market
the
stud
of
three
horses
requires
a
groom
and
abdul
rahim
is
sending
a
who
looks
a
character
to
attend
us
to
tihran
a
muleteer
remarkable
in
appearance
and
beauty
and
twelve
fine
mules
have
been
engaged
the
and
several
other
men
have
applied
to
me
for
medicine
having
fearful
coughs
but
i
have
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
cure
them
as
their
maladies
chiefly
require
good
feeding
warm
bedding
and
poultices
which
are
unattainable
it
is
pitiable
to
see
the
poor
shivering
in
their
thin
cotton
clothes
in
such
weather
the
men
make
shift
with
the
seamless
felt
coats
more
cloaks
than
coats
with
long
sleeves
tapering
to
the
size
of
a
glove
but
with
a
slit
midway
through
which
the
hands
can
be
protruded
when
need
arises
the
women
have
no
outer
garment
but
the
thin
cotton
i
have
tried
to
get
a
bed
made
but
there
is
no
wood
strong
enough
for
the
purpose
and
the
bazars
can
not
produce
any
canvas
yesterday
we
were
to
have
started
at
nine
but
the
usual
quarrelling
about
loads
detained
us
till
so
that
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
reached
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
a
three
weeks
journey
from
the
house
roof
the
prospect
was
most
dismal
it
was
partly
thawing
and
through
the
whiteness
of
the
plain
ran
a
brown
trail
with
sodden
edges
indicating
mud
the
great
mass
of
the
or
behistun
or
behishtan
though
on
the
other
side
of
the
plain
seemed
actually
impending
over
the
city
with
its
great
black
rock
masses
too
steep
to
hold
the
snow
and
the
besitun
mountain
itself
said
to
be
miles
away
looming
darkly
through
gray
snow
clouds
looked
hardly
ten
our
host
had
sent
men
on
to
see
if
the
landau
could
take
me
part
of
the
way
at
least
but
their
verdict
was
that
the
road
was
impassable
after
much
noise
the
caravan
got
under
way
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
fine
mules
we
had
engaged
had
been
changed
for
a
poor
set
and
that
the
fine
i
was
to
have
had
was
metamorphosed
into
a
poor
weak
creature
which
began
to
drop
his
leg
from
the
shoulder
almost
as
soon
as
we
were
outside
the
walls
and
on
a
steep
bridge
came
down
on
his
nose
with
a
violent
fall
giving
me
a
sharp
strain
and
fell
several
times
afterwards
indeed
the
poor
animal
could
scarcely
keep
on
his
legs
during
the
eight
hours
march
hadji
rode
in
a
balanced
by
some
luggage
and
was
to
keep
close
to
me
but
when
i
wanted
to
change
my
beast
for
a
pannier
he
was
not
to
be
seen
then
or
afterwards
and
came
in
late
the
big
mule
had
fallen
he
was
bruised
the
were
smashed
to
pieces
and
were
broken
up
for
firewood
and
i
am
now
without
any
means
of
getting
any
rest
from
riding
it
the
pace
that
kills
in
snow
and
mud
gallops
are
impossible
and
three
miles
an
hour
is
good
going
an
hour
from
kirmanshah
the
road
crosses
the
karasu
by
a
good
brick
bridge
and
proceeds
over
the
plain
for
many
miles
keeping
the
besitun
range
about
two
miles
on
the
left
and
then
passes
over
undulating
ground
to
the
besitun
village
two
or
three
large
villages
occur
at
a
distance
from
the
road
now
shut
in
and
about
eight
miles
from
besitun
there
are
marble
columns
lying
on
the
ground
among
some
remains
of
marble
walls
now
only
hummocks
in
the
snow
the
road
was
churned
into
deep
mud
by
the
passage
of
animals
and
the
snow
was
too
deep
to
ride
in
my
mule
lost
no
opportunity
of
tumbling
down
and
i
felt
myself
a
barbarian
for
urging
him
on
hills
and
mountains
glistened
in
all
directions
the
only
exception
to
the
general
whiteness
was
piru
the
great
rock
mass
of
besitun
which
ever
loomed
blackly
overhead
through
clouds
and
darkness
and
never
seemed
any
nearer
it
was
very
solitary
i
met
only
a
caravan
of
carpets
and
a
few
men
struggling
along
with
laden
asses
it
was
the
most
artistic
day
of
the
whole
journey
much
cloud
flying
about
mountains
in
indigo
gloom
or
in
gray
with
storm
clouds
round
their
heads
or
pure
white
with
shadows
touched
in
with
cobalt
while
peaks
and
ridges
gleamed
here
and
there
above
indigo
and
gray
not
a
tree
or
even
bush
on
them
or
on
the
plain
broke
the
monotony
after
a
summer
palace
of
the
shah
surrounded
by
poplars
was
passed
there
is
plenty
of
water
everywhere
as
the
sun
was
stormily
tinging
with
pink
the
rolling
here
and
there
i
halted
on
the
brow
of
a
slope
under
the
imposing
rock
front
of
besitun
to
wait
for
orders
it
was
wildly
magnificent
the
huge
precipice
of
piru
rising
feet
from
the
level
the
mountains
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
approaching
each
other
and
behind
piru
a
craggy
ravine
glorified
here
and
there
by
touches
of
amber
and
pink
upon
the
clouds
which
boiled
furiously
out
of
its
depths
in
the
foreground
were
a
huge
caravanserai
with
a
noble
portal
a
solitary
thing
upon
the
snow
not
a
dwelling
but
offering
its
frigid
hospitality
to
all
comers
a
river
with
many
windings
and
the
ruinous
hovels
of
besitun
huddled
in
the
mud
behind
an
appalling
view
in
the
wild
twilight
of
a
winter
evening
and
as
the
pink
died
out
a
desolate
ghastliness
fell
upon
it
as
i
waited
all
but
worn
out
by
the
long
march
the
tumbling
mule
and
the
icy
wind
i
thought
i
should
like
never
to
hear
the
deep
chimes
of
a
persian
caravan
or
see
the
huge
portal
of
a
persian
caravanserai
any
more
these
are
cowardly
emotions
which
are
dispelled
by
warmth
and
food
but
at
that
moment
there
was
not
much
prospect
of
either
through
seas
of
mud
and
by
mounds
of
filth
we
entered
besitun
a
most
wretched
village
of
eighteen
hovels
chiefly
ruinous
where
we
dismounted
in
the
mixed
snow
and
mud
of
a
yard
at
a
hovel
of
three
rooms
vacated
by
a
family
it
was
a
better
shelter
than
could
have
been
hoped
for
though
after
a
fire
was
made
which
filled
the
room
with
smoke
i
had
to
move
from
place
to
place
to
avoid
the
drip
from
the
roof
hadji
said
he
was
ill
of
fever
and
seemed
like
an
idiot
but
the
orderly
said
that
the
illness
was
shammed
and
the
stupidity
assumed
in
order
not
to
work
i
told
him
to
put
the
mattress
on
the
bed
pour
water
on
the
mattress
he
replied
i
repeated
put
the
mattress
on
the
bed
to
which
he
replied
put
the
mattress
into
water
i
said
if
he
felt
too
ill
for
his
work
he
might
go
to
bed
god
knows
he
answered
yes
knows
that
you
are
a
lazy
humbugging
brute
a
objurgation
from
m
which
elicited
a
prolonged
allah
but
produced
no
effect
as
the
tea
and
were
not
relatively
but
absolutely
cold
the
next
morning
the
next
day
dawned
miserably
and
the
daylight
when
it
came
was
only
a
few
removes
from
darkness
yet
it
was
enough
to
bring
out
the
horrors
of
that
wretched
place
and
the
dirt
and
poverty
of
the
people
who
were
a
prey
to
skin
diseases
many
readers
will
remember
that
sir
rawlinson
considers
that
there
are
good
geographical
and
etymological
reasons
for
identifying
besitun
with
the
baghistan
or
place
of
gardens
of
the
greeks
and
with
the
famous
which
tradition
ascribes
to
semiramis
but
of
these
gardens
not
a
trace
remains
a
precipitous
rock
smoothed
at
its
lower
part
a
vigorous
spring
gushing
out
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
two
tablets
one
of
which
at
a
height
of
over
feet
visible
from
the
road
but
inaccessible
is
an
ach√¶menian
sculpture
portraying
the
majesty
of
darius
with
about
a
thousand
lines
of
cuneiform
writing
are
all
that
survive
of
the
ancient
splendours
of
besitun
with
the
exception
of
some
buttresses
opposite
the
rock
belonging
to
a
vanished
sasanian
bridge
over
the
gamasiab
and
some
fragments
of
other
buildings
of
the
sasanian
epoch
these
deeply
interesting
antiquities
have
been
described
and
illustrated
by
sir
rawlinson
flandin
and
coste
and
others
it
has
been
a
severe
day
it
was
so
unpromising
that
a
start
was
only
decided
on
after
many
pros
and
cons
through
dark
air
small
flakes
of
snow
fell
sparsely
at
intervals
from
a
sky
from
which
all
light
had
died
out
gusts
of
icy
wind
swept
down
every
gorge
huge
ragged
masses
of
cloud
drifted
wildly
round
the
frowning
mass
of
piru
now
and
then
the
gusts
ceased
and
there
was
an
inauspicious
calm
i
rode
a
big
mule
not
used
to
the
bit
very
troublesome
and
mulish
at
first
but
broken
in
an
hour
a
clear
blink
revealed
the
tablets
but
from
their
great
altitude
the
tallest
of
the
figures
only
looked
two
feet
high
there
is
little
to
see
on
this
march
even
under
favourable
circumstances
a
few
villages
the
ruined
fort
of
hassan
khan
now
used
as
a
caravanserai
on
a
height
the
windings
of
the
gamasiab
and
a
few
canals
crossed
by
brick
bridges
represent
its
chief
features
impressions
of
a
country
received
in
a
storm
are
likely
to
be
incorrect
but
they
were
pleasurable
everything
seemed
on
a
grand
scale
here
desolate
plateaus
pure
white
there
high
mountains
and
tremendous
gorges
from
which
white
mists
were
boiling
up
everything
was
shrouded
in
mystery
plain
prose
ceased
to
be
for
some
hours
the
others
had
to
make
several
halts
so
i
left
the
light
division
and
rode
on
alone
it
became
dark
and
wild
and
presently
the
surface
of
the
snow
began
to
move
and
to
drift
furiously
for
about
a
foot
above
the
ground
the
wind
rose
to
a
gale
i
held
my
hat
on
with
one
hand
my
mackintosh
cape
blew
inside
out
and
struck
me
such
a
heavy
blow
on
the
eyes
that
for
some
time
i
could
not
see
and
had
to
trust
to
the
mule
the
wind
rose
higher
it
was
furious
and
the
drift
not
only
from
the
valley
but
from
the
mountain
sides
was
higher
than
my
head
stinging
and
hissing
as
it
raced
by
it
was
a
blizzard
a
brutal
carrying
fine
sharp
snow
crystals
which
beat
on
my
eyes
and
blinded
them
after
a
short
experience
of
it
my
mule
turned
tail
and
needed
spurring
to
make
him
face
it
i
fought
on
for
an
hour
crossed
what
appeared
to
be
a
bridge
where
there
were
a
few
mud
hovels
and
pressed
on
down
a
narrower
valley
the
blizzard
became
frightful
from
every
ravine
gusts
of
storm
came
down
sweeping
the
powdery
snow
from
the
hillsides
into
the
valley
the
mountains
were
blotted
out
the
depression
in
the
snow
which
erewhile
had
marked
the
path
was
gone
i
could
not
even
see
the
mule
neck
and
he
was
floundering
in
deep
snow
up
to
the
girths
the
hiss
of
the
drift
had
increased
to
a
roar
the
violence
of
the
storm
produced
breathlessness
and
the
intense
cold
numbness
it
was
dangerous
for
a
solitary
traveller
and
thinking
that
m
would
be
bothered
by
missing
one
of
the
party
under
such
circumstances
i
turned
and
waited
under
the
lee
of
a
ruinous
mud
hovel
for
a
long
long
time
till
the
others
came
up
two
of
the
men
having
been
unhorsed
in
a
drift
in
those
hovels
there
were
neither
accommodation
nor
supplies
and
we
decided
to
push
on
it
was
never
so
bad
again
the
wind
moderated
wet
snow
fell
heavily
but
cleared
off
and
there
was
a
brilliant
blue
heaven
with
heavy
sunlit
among
which
colossal
mountain
forms
displayed
themselves
two
peaks
in
glorious
sunlight
high
high
above
a
whirling
which
was
itself
far
above
a
great
mountain
range
below
there
were
rifts
valleys
gorges
naked
nearly
perpendicular
rocks
the
faces
of
mountains
half
of
which
had
fallen
down
in
the
opposite
direction
a
valley
a
winding
river
with
brief
blue
stretches
a
ruined
fort
on
an
eminence
a
sharp
turn
a
sudden
twilight
and
then
another
blizzard
far
colder
than
the
last
raging
down
a
lateral
ravine
up
which
even
through
the
blinding
drift
were
to
be
seen
to
all
seeming
higher
than
mountains
of
this
earth
the
twin
peaks
of
shamran
lighted
by
the
sun
i
faced
the
blizzard
for
some
time
and
then
knowing
that
hadji
and
the
cook
who
were
behind
me
would
turn
off
to
a
distant
village
all
trace
of
a
track
having
disappeared
i
rode
fully
a
mile
back
and
waited
half
an
hour
for
them
they
were
and
had
hardly
been
able
to
urge
their
mules
which
were
lightly
laden
through
the
snow
and
hadji
was
groaning
allah
the
blizzard
was
over
and
the
sky
almost
cloudless
but
the
mercury
had
fallen
to
and
a
keen
wind
was
still
blowing
the
powdery
snow
to
the
height
of
a
foot
i
sent
the
two
men
on
in
front
and
by
dint
of
calling
to
them
constantly
kept
them
from
getting
into
drifts
of
unknown
depth
we
rode
up
a
rising
plateau
for
two
hours
a
plateau
of
deep
glittering
blinding
trackless
snow
giving
back
the
sunshine
in
millions
of
diamond
flashings
through
all
this
region
thistles
grow
to
a
height
of
four
feet
and
the
only
way
of
finding
the
track
was
to
look
out
for
a
space
on
which
no
withered
appeared
above
the
snow
this
village
of
sannah
lies
at
an
altitude
of
about
feet
among
poplar
plantations
and
beautiful
gardens
in
which
fine
walnut
trees
are
conspicuous
though
partly
ruinous
it
is
a
flourishing
little
place
its
lands
being
abundantly
watered
by
streams
which
run
into
the
gamasiab
it
is
buried
now
in
snow
and
the
only
mode
of
reaching
it
is
up
the
bed
of
a
broad
sparkling
stream
among
the
gardens
the
met
us
here
the
navigation
being
difficult
and
the
light
division
having
come
up
we
were
taken
to
the
best
house
in
the
village
where
the
family
have
vacated
two
rooms
below
the
level
of
a
yard
full
of
snow
the
plateau
and
its
adjacent
mountains
were
flushed
with
rose
as
we
entered
sannah
and
as
soon
as
the
change
to
the
pallor
of
death
came
on
the
mercury
raced
down
to
zero
outside
and
it
is
only
in
the
room
in
which
i
am
writing
there
is
a
large
caravanserai
at
the
entrance
to
sannah
and
i
suspect
that
the
in
choosing
private
quarters
bullies
the
headman
and
throws
the
village
into
confusion
turning
the
women
and
children
out
of
the
rooms
the
owners
though
they
get
a
handsome
sum
for
the
accommodation
having
to
give
him
an
equally
handsome
after
nearly
nine
hours
of
a
crawling
pace
and
exposure
to
violent
weather
i
suffered
from
intense
pain
in
my
joints
and
was
dragged
and
lifted
in
and
put
into
a
chair
i
write
put
for
i
was
nearly
helpless
and
had
to
take
a
teaspoonful
of
whisky
in
warm
milk
while
the
fire
was
being
made
two
women
with
a
gentle
kindliness
which
won
my
heart
chafed
my
trembling
nearly
frozen
hands
with
their
own
with
kindly
womanly
looks
which
supplied
the
place
of
speech
i
lay
down
under
a
heap
of
good
blankets
sorry
to
see
them
in
thin
cotton
clothes
and
when
i
was
less
frozen
observed
my
room
and
its
grotesquely
miserable
aspect
the
savage
never
taking
any
trouble
to
arrange
it
there
are
no
windows
and
the
divided
door
does
not
shut
by
three
inches
a
low
hole
leads
into
the
granary
which
is
also
the
but
the
fowls
have
no
idea
of
keeping
to
their
own
apartment
two
sheep
with
injured
legs
lie
in
a
corner
with
some
fodder
beside
them
a
heap
of
faggots
the
bed
placed
diagonally
to
avoid
the
firehole
in
the
floor
a
splashed
tarpaulin
on
which
hadji
threw
down
the
saddle
and
bridle
plastered
with
mud
and
all
my
travelling
gear
a
puddle
of
frozen
water
a
plough
and
some
ox
yokes
an
occasional
gust
of
ashes
covering
everything
and
clouds
of
smoke
from
wood
which
refuses
to
do
anything
but
smoke
are
the
luxuries
of
the
halt
the
house
is
full
of
people
and
the
women
come
in
and
out
without
scruple
and
i
am
really
glad
to
see
them
though
it
is
difficult
to
rouse
hadji
from
his
opium
pipe
and
coffee
and
his
comfortable
lounge
by
a
good
fire
to
interpret
for
them
the
day
experiences
remind
me
of
the
lines
bare
all
he
could
endure
and
bare
not
always
well
but
tired
and
benumbed
as
i
am
i
much
prefer
a
march
with
excitements
and
difficulties
to
the
monotony
of
splashing
through
mud
in
warm
rain
the
next
morning
opened
cloudless
with
the
mercury
at
which
was
hardly
an
excuse
for
tea
and
being
quite
cold
i
was
ready
much
too
early
and
the
servants
having
given
out
that
i
am
a
my
room
was
crowded
with
women
and
children
all
suffering
from
eye
diseases
and
scrofula
five
women
not
nearly
in
middle
life
with
cataract
advanced
in
both
eyes
and
many
with
incurved
eyelids
the
result
of
wood
smoke
it
was
most
painful
to
see
their
disappointment
when
i
told
them
that
it
would
need
time
to
cure
some
of
them
and
that
for
others
i
could
do
nothing
could
i
not
stay
they
pleaded
i
could
have
that
room
and
milk
and
eggs
the
best
they
had
and
they
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
i
felt
like
a
brute
for
leaving
them
the
people
there
showed
much
interest
in
our
movements
crowding
on
the
roofs
to
see
our
gear
and
the
start
the
order
of
march
now
is
light
division
three
mules
with
an
orderly
hadji
and
the
cook
upon
them
the
two
last
carrying
what
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
night
in
case
the
heavy
division
can
not
get
on
m
and
an
orderly
the
abbas
khan
another
who
is
changed
daily
the
light
division
and
i
sometimes
start
together
but
as
the
others
are
detained
by
work
on
the
road
i
usually
ride
on
ahead
with
the
two
servants
to
write
that
we
all
survived
the
march
of
that
day
is
strange
when
the
same
pitiless
blast
or
demon
wind
blowing
from
the
roof
of
the
world
the
pamir
desert
made
corpses
of
five
men
who
started
with
a
caravan
ahead
of
us
that
morning
we
had
to
climb
a
long
ascending
plateau
for
feet
to
surmount
a
pass
the
snow
was
at
times
three
feet
deep
and
the
tracks
even
of
a
heavy
caravan
which
crossed
before
us
were
effaced
by
the
drift
in
a
few
minutes
a
sun
without
heat
glared
and
scintillated
like
an
electric
light
white
and
unsympathetic
out
of
a
pitiless
sky
without
a
cloud
as
soon
as
we
emerged
from
sannah
the
demon
wind
seized
on
us
a
steady
blighting
searching
merciless
blast
no
rise
or
fall
no
lull
no
hope
steadily
and
strongly
it
swept
at
a
temperature
of
across
the
glittering
ascent
swept
bare
enveloped
us
at
times
in
glittering
swirls
of
powdery
snow
which
after
biting
and
stinging
careered
over
the
slopes
in
twisted
columns
screeched
down
gorges
and
whistled
like
the
demon
it
was
as
it
drifted
the
light
frozen
snow
in
layers
in
ripples
in
waves
a
cruel
benumbing
blinding
withering
invisibility
the
six
woollen
layers
of
my
mask
my
three
pairs
of
gloves
my
sheepskin
coat
fur
cloak
and
mackintosh
piled
on
over
a
swaddling
mass
of
woollen
clothing
were
as
nothing
before
that
awful
blast
it
was
not
a
question
of
comfort
or
discomfort
or
of
suffering
more
or
less
severe
but
of
life
or
death
as
the
corpses
a
few
miles
ahead
of
us
show
i
am
certain
that
if
it
had
lasted
another
i
too
should
have
perished
the
torture
of
my
limbs
down
to
my
feet
of
my
temples
and
cheekbones
the
anguish
and
uselessness
of
my
hands
from
which
the
reins
had
dropped
were
of
small
consequence
compared
with
a
chill
which
crept
round
my
heart
threatening
a
cessation
of
work
there
were
groans
behind
me
the
cook
and
hadji
had
rolled
off
into
the
snow
where
hadji
was
calling
on
him
who
is
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
m
was
on
foot
his
mask
was
frozen
hard
he
was
using
a
scientific
instrument
and
told
his
orderly
an
afghan
a
smart
little
of
a
crack
indian
to
fasten
a
strap
the
man
replied
sadly
i
ca
sahib
his
arms
and
hands
were
useless
my
mask
was
frozen
to
my
lips
the
tears
extorted
from
my
eyes
were
frozen
i
was
so
helpless
and
in
such
torture
that
i
would
gladly
have
lain
down
to
die
in
the
snow
the
mercury
fell
to
after
fighting
the
elements
for
three
hours
and
a
half
we
crossed
the
crest
of
the
pass
at
an
altitude
of
feet
to
look
down
upon
a
snow
world
stretched
out
everywhere
pure
glistering
awful
mountains
rolling
in
snowy
ranges
valleys
without
a
trace
of
man
a
world
of
horror
glittering
under
a
mocking
sun
hadji
with
many
pious
ejaculations
gasped
out
that
he
was
dying
in
fact
for
some
time
all
speech
had
been
reduced
to
a
gasp
but
when
we
got
over
the
crest
there
was
no
more
wind
and
all
the
benumbed
limbs
resumed
sensation
through
an
experience
of
anguish
the
road
to
kangawar
lies
through
a
broad
valley
which
has
many
streams
among
the
mountains
which
encompass
it
are
the
boka
the
and
the
i
rode
on
with
the
two
servants
indulging
in
no
higher
thoughts
than
of
the
comfort
i
should
have
in
lying
down
when
just
in
front
of
me
hadji
turned
a
somersault
my
alpenstock
flying
in
one
direction
and
the
medicine
chest
in
another
while
he
lay
motionless
flat
on
his
back
with
all
his
limbs
stretched
out
just
as
soldiers
who
have
been
shot
lie
in
pictures
in
getting
to
him
my
mule
went
down
in
a
out
of
which
i
extricated
him
with
difficulty
i
induced
hadji
who
said
his
back
was
broken
and
was
groaning
and
calling
on
allah
to
get
up
and
went
on
to
secure
his
mule
which
had
the
great
under
its
body
and
was
kicking
with
all
its
might
at
my
bed
and
which
were
between
its
hind
legs
and
succeeded
in
catching
and
holding
it
till
hadji
came
up
i
told
him
to
unfasten
the
surcingle
for
the
animal
was
wild
with
the
things
among
its
legs
and
he
wrung
his
hands
and
beat
his
breast
exclaiming
god
is
great
god
knows
i
shall
never
see
bushire
again
and
was
quite
helpless
seeing
a
caravan
of
asses
approaching
i
rode
on
as
fast
as
i
could
to
the
little
town
of
kangawar
expecting
him
to
follow
shortly
at
present
the
entrance
into
kangawar
is
up
the
bed
of
a
stream
we
had
been
promised
good
accommodation
there
and
the
town
could
evidently
afford
it
but
abbas
khan
had
chosen
something
very
wretched
though
it
was
upstairs
and
had
an
extensive
snow
view
crumbling
difficult
stairs
at
each
end
of
a
crumbling
mud
house
led
to
rooms
which
barely
afforded
a
shelter
with
a
ruinous
barn
between
where
the
servants
regardless
of
consequences
kept
up
a
bonfire
a
man
shovelled
most
of
the
snow
out
of
my
room
and
tried
to
make
a
fire
but
failed
as
neither
he
nor
i
could
stand
the
smoke
produced
by
the
attempt
this
imperfect
shelter
had
a
with
three
out
of
its
four
wooden
panes
gone
and
a
cracked
door
which
could
only
ensure
partial
privacy
by
being
laid
against
the
posts
from
the
outer
landing
which
was
a
flat
roof
the
wall
was
full
of
cracks
big
enough
for
a
finger
through
which
the
night
wind
rioted
in
a
temperature
below
zero
there
was
nothing
to
sit
upon
and
i
walked
up
and
down
for
two
hours
watching
the
straggling
line
of
the
caravan
as
it
crawled
along
the
valley
till
the
sunset
flush
changed
into
the
chill
of
twilight
hadji
arrived
with
it
having
broken
his
girth
after
i
left
him
there
was
not
much
comfort
after
the
severe
march
owing
to
the
draughts
and
the
smoke
but
one
is
always
hungry
and
sleepy
and
the
hybernation
of
the
insects
makes
up
for
any
minor
discomforts
it
was
so
cold
that
some
water
in
a
cup
froze
before
i
could
drink
it
and
the
blanket
over
my
face
was
hard
frozen
kangawar
was
full
of
mourning
the
bodies
of
two
men
and
a
boy
who
had
perished
on
the
plain
while
we
were
struggling
up
the
pass
had
been
brought
in
this
boy
of
twelve
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
was
a
widow
he
had
started
from
kangawar
in
the
morning
with
five
asses
laden
with
chopped
straw
to
sell
for
her
and
had
miserably
perished
the
two
men
were
married
and
had
left
families
kangawar
is
a
town
of
a
thousand
people
built
below
a
high
hill
on
some
natural
and
artificial
mounds
some
traditions
regarding
semiramis
are
localised
there
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
on
the
site
of
pancobar
where
she
erected
a
temple
to
anaitis
or
artemis
ruins
of
a
fortress
now
occupy
the
crest
of
a
hill
above
the
town
and
there
are
other
ruins
regarded
by
antiquaries
as
grecian
representing
a
temple
or
palace
a
vast
building
constructed
of
enormous
blocks
of
dressed
stone
of
these
remains
i
saw
nothing
but
some
columns
and
a
pilaster
which
are
built
into
the
miserable
mud
walls
of
a
house
near
the
bazar
at
night
the
muleteers
were
beseeching
on
their
knees
they
said
that
they
could
not
go
on
that
the
caravan
which
had
attempted
to
leave
kangawar
in
the
morning
had
put
back
with
three
corpses
and
that
they
and
their
mules
would
perish
in
the
morning
it
was
for
some
time
doubtful
whether
they
could
be
induced
or
bribed
to
proceed
the
day
was
fine
and
still
but
they
said
that
the
snow
was
not
broken
at
last
they
agreed
to
start
if
we
would
promise
to
return
at
the
first
breath
of
wind
every
resource
against
cold
was
brought
out
and
put
on
one
eye
was
all
that
was
visible
of
the
servants
faces
the
relied
on
their
felt
coats
and
raw
sheepskins
with
the
fur
inside
roped
round
their
legs
there
is
danger
of
even
with
all
precautions
in
addition
to
double
woollen
underclothing
i
put
on
a
pair
of
thick
chitral
socks
over
two
pairs
of
woollen
stockings
and
over
these
a
pair
of
long
loose
afghan
boots
made
of
sheepskin
with
the
fur
inside
over
my
riding
dress
which
is
of
flannel
lined
with
heavy
homespun
i
had
a
long
homespun
jacket
an
afghan
sheepskin
coat
a
heavy
fur
cloak
over
my
knees
and
a
stout
regulation
waterproof
to
keep
out
the
wind
add
to
this
a
cork
helmet
a
fisherman
hood
a
mask
two
pairs
of
woollen
gloves
with
mittens
and
double
gauntlets
and
the
difficulty
of
mounting
and
dismounting
for
a
person
thus
may
be
imagined
the
persians
are
all
in
cotton
clothes
however
though
they
have
no
firesides
and
no
cheerful
crackle
and
blaze
of
wood
they
have
an
arrangement
by
which
they
can
keep
themselves
warm
for
hours
by
the
expenditure
of
a
few
handfuls
of
animal
fuel
the
fire
hole
or
nd
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
is
an
institution
it
is
circular
narrows
somewhat
at
the
top
and
bottom
has
a
flue
leading
to
the
bottom
from
the
outside
and
is
about
three
feet
deep
and
two
in
diameter
it
is
smoothly
lined
with
clay
inside
over
this
is
the
or
platform
a
skeleton
wooden
frame
like
an
inverted
table
from
two
to
five
feet
square
covered
with
blankets
or
a
cotton
quilt
which
extends
four
or
five
feet
beyond
it
cushions
are
placed
under
this
and
the
women
huddle
under
it
all
day
and
the
whole
family
at
night
and
in
this
weather
all
day
the
firepot
in
the
hole
giving
them
comfortable
warmth
both
for
sleeping
and
waking
they
very
rarely
wash
and
the
is
so
favourable
for
the
development
of
vermin
that
i
always
hurry
it
out
of
the
room
when
i
enter
so
excellent
and
economical
is
the
contrivance
that
a
nd
in
which
the
fire
has
not
been
replenished
for
eighteen
hours
has
still
a
genial
heat
it
was
a
serious
start
so
terribly
slippery
in
the
alleys
and
uncovered
bazars
of
kangawar
that
several
of
the
mules
and
men
fell
outside
the
town
was
a
level
expanse
of
deep
wrinkled
drifted
wavy
scintillating
snow
unbroken
except
for
a
rut
about
a
foot
wide
a
deep
long
mule
ladder
produced
by
mules
and
asses
each
stepping
in
its
predecessor
footsteps
forming
short
deep
corrugations
in
which
it
is
painful
and
tedious
for
horses
or
animals
to
walk
for
nine
hours
we
marched
through
this
corrugated
rut
leaving
on
the
left
the
summer
route
to
tihran
hamadan
which
is
said
to
have
been
blocked
for
twenty
days
we
embarked
upon
a
glittering
plain
covered
with
pure
snow
varying
in
depth
from
two
feet
on
the
level
to
ten
and
fifteen
in
the
drifts
crossed
by
a
narrow
and
only
slightly
beaten
track
ere
long
we
came
on
solemn
traces
of
the
struggle
and
defeat
of
the
day
before
every
now
and
then
a
load
of
chopped
straw
thrown
away
then
the
deep
snow
much
trampled
then
the
snow
dug
away
and
piled
round
a
small
space
in
which
the
had
tried
to
shelter
themselves
from
the
wind
as
the
shadows
of
death
fell
then
more
straw
and
a
grave
under
a
high
mound
of
snow
farther
on
some
men
busy
burying
one
of
the
bodies
the
air
was
still
and
the
sun
shone
as
it
had
shone
the
day
before
on
baffled
struggles
exhaustion
and
death
the
trampling
of
the
snow
near
the
track
marked
the
place
where
the
caravan
had
turned
taking
three
out
of
the
five
bodies
back
to
kangawar
the
fury
with
which
the
wind
had
swept
over
the
plain
was
shown
by
the
absolute
level
to
which
it
had
reduced
the
snow
the
deep
watercourses
being
filled
up
with
the
drifts
after
crossing
a
brick
bridge
and
passing
the
nearly
buried
village
of
husseinabad
we
rode
hour
after
hour
along
a
rolling
track
among
featureless
hills
till
in
the
last
twilight
we
reached
the
village
of
pharipah
a
place
must
never
be
understood
to
mean
anything
lower
than
feet
among
some
frozen
irrigated
lands
and
watered
gardens
i
arrived
nearly
dead
from
cold
fatigue
and
the
severe
pains
in
the
joints
which
are
produced
by
riding
nine
hours
at
a
foot
pace
in
a
temperature
of
my
mule
could
only
be
urged
on
by
spurring
and
all
the
men
and
animals
were
in
a
state
of
great
fatigue
my
room
was
very
cold
as
much
of
one
side
was
open
to
the
air
and
a
fire
was
an
impossibility
except
for
the
crossing
of
a
pass
with
an
altitude
of
feet
the
next
day
route
was
monotonous
across
plains
among
mountains
all
pure
white
the
only
incidents
being
that
my
chair
was
broken
by
the
fall
of
a
mule
and
that
my
mule
and
i
went
over
our
heads
in
a
the
track
was
very
little
broken
and
i
was
four
hours
in
doing
ten
miles
hamilabad
is
a
village
of
about
sixty
mud
hovels
and
in
common
with
all
these
mountain
hamlets
has
sloping
covered
ways
leading
to
pens
under
the
house
where
cattle
sheep
and
goats
spend
much
of
the
winter
in
darkness
and
warmth
i
have
a
house
a
mud
room
to
myself
these
two
days
i
have
had
rather
a
severe
chill
after
getting
in
including
a
shivering
lasting
about
two
hours
perhaps
owing
to
the
severe
fatigue
and
i
was
lying
down
with
the
blankets
over
my
face
and
was
just
getting
warm
when
i
heard
much
buzzing
about
me
and
looking
up
saw
the
room
thronged
with
men
women
and
children
just
such
a
crowd
as
constantly
besieged
our
blessed
lord
when
the
toilsome
day
full
of
the
contradiction
of
sinners
against
himself
was
done
most
of
them
ill
of
divers
diseases
and
torments
smallpox
rheumatism
ulcers
on
the
cornea
abortive
and
shortened
limbs
decay
of
the
bones
of
the
nose
palate
and
cheek
tumours
cancers
skin
maladies
ophthalmia
opaque
films
over
the
eyes
wounds
and
many
ailments
too
obscure
for
my
elementary
knowledge
nothing
is
more
painful
than
to
be
obliged
to
say
that
one
can
not
do
anything
for
them
i
had
to
get
up
and
for
nearly
two
hours
was
hearing
their
tales
of
suffering
interpreted
by
hadji
with
brutal
frankness
and
they
crowded
my
room
again
this
morning
all
i
could
do
was
to
make
various
ointments
taking
tallow
as
the
basis
drop
lotion
into
some
eyes
give
a
few
simple
medicines
and
send
the
majority
sadly
away
the
abbas
khan
is
responsible
for
spreading
my
fame
as
a
he
is
being
cured
of
a
severe
cough
and
comes
to
my
room
for
medicine
in
which
i
have
no
faith
every
evening
a
lean
man
with
a
lean
face
lighted
with
a
rapacious
astuteness
with
a
streaming
from
his
brow
except
where
it
is
roped
round
his
shaven
skull
a
zouave
jacket
a
skirt
something
like
a
kilt
but
which
stands
out
like
a
ballet
dancer
dress
all
sorts
of
wrappings
round
his
legs
a
coarse
striped
red
shirt
a
double
and
a
perfect
armoury
in
his
girdle
of
pistols
and
knives
he
is
a
wit
and
a
rogue
dogs
deprived
of
their
usual
shelter
shook
my
loose
door
at
intervals
all
night
this
morning
is
gray
and
looks
like
change
it
was
thawing
and
the
march
here
was
very
soft
and
splashy
the
people
are
barbarous
in
their
looks
speech
manners
and
ways
of
living
and
have
a
total
disregard
of
cleanliness
of
person
clothing
and
dwellings
whether
they
are
actually
too
poor
to
have
anything
warmer
than
cotton
clothing
or
whether
they
have
buried
hoards
i
do
not
know
but
even
in
this
severe
weather
the
women
of
this
region
have
nothing
on
their
feet
and
their
short
blue
cotton
trousers
short
loose
open
jackets
short
open
chemises
and
the
thin
blue
sheet
or
over
their
heads
are
a
mere
apology
for
clothing
the
journey
yesterday
was
through
rolling
hills
enclosing
level
plains
much
cultivated
with
villages
upon
them
mostly
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
road
i
passed
through
two
one
larger
and
less
decayed
than
usual
but
fearfully
filthy
and
bisected
by
a
foul
stream
from
which
people
were
drinking
and
drawing
water
near
this
is
a
lofty
mound
a
truncated
cone
with
some
cyclopean
masonry
on
its
summit
the
relics
of
a
fire
temple
of
the
magi
another
poorer
and
yet
filthier
village
was
passed
through
where
a
man
was
being
buried
and
as
i
left
hamilabad
in
the
morning
a
long
procession
was
escorting
a
corpse
to
its
icy
grave
laid
on
its
bedding
on
a
bier
both
these
deaths
being
from
smallpox
which
though
very
prevalent
is
not
usually
fatal
and
seldom
attacks
adults
indeed
it
is
regarded
as
a
childish
malady
and
is
cured
by
a
diet
of
melons
and
by
profuse
perspirations
a
higher
temperature
had
turned
the
path
to
slush
and
made
the
crossing
of
the
last
plain
very
tedious
this
is
an
abominable
village
and
the
thaw
is
revealing
a
state
of
matters
which
the
snow
would
have
concealed
but
it
has
been
a
severe
week
journey
and
i
am
glad
of
sunday
rest
even
here
it
is
a
disheartening
place
i
dismounted
in
one
yard
in
slush
up
to
my
knees
and
from
this
splashed
into
another
round
which
are
stables
cowsheds
and
rooms
which
were
vacated
by
the
and
his
family
but
only
partially
as
the
women
not
only
left
all
their
things
in
my
room
but
had
a
or
storehouse
through
it
to
which
they
resorted
continually
i
felt
ill
yesterday
and
put
on
a
blister
which
rendered
complete
rest
desirable
but
it
is
not
to
be
got
the
room
filled
with
women
as
soon
as
i
settled
myself
in
it
they
told
me
at
once
that
i
could
not
have
a
fire
unless
i
had
it
under
the
that
the
smoke
would
be
unbearable
when
i
asked
them
to
leave
me
to
rest
they
said
there
no
shame
in
having
women
in
the
house
m
came
an
hour
later
and
cleared
the
room
but
as
soon
as
he
went
away
it
filled
again
and
with
men
as
well
as
women
and
others
unscrupulously
tore
out
the
paper
panes
from
the
windows
this
afternoon
i
stayed
in
bed
feeling
rather
ill
and
about
three
a
number
of
women
in
blue
sheets
with
a
very
definite
leader
came
in
arranged
the
filling
the
room
with
smoke
as
a
preliminary
gathered
themselves
under
the
quilt
and
sat
there
talking
loudly
to
each
other
i
felt
myself
the
object
of
a
focused
stare
and
covered
my
head
with
a
blanket
in
despair
then
more
women
came
in
with
and
they
all
took
tea
and
sat
for
another
hour
or
two
talking
and
tittering
hadji
assuring
me
that
they
were
doing
it
out
of
kindness
because
i
was
not
well
and
they
thought
it
dull
for
me
alone
the
room
was
again
cleared
and
i
got
up
at
dark
and
hearing
a
great
deal
of
whispering
and
giggling
saw
that
they
had
opened
the
door
windows
and
that
a
crowd
was
outside
when
i
woke
this
morning
a
man
was
examining
my
clothes
which
were
hanging
up
they
feel
and
pull
my
hair
finger
all
my
things
and
have
broken
all
the
fine
teeth
out
of
my
comb
they
have
the
curiosity
without
the
gracefulness
of
the
japanese
this
is
a
house
of
the
better
sort
though
the
walls
are
not
plastered
a
carpet
loom
is
fixed
into
the
floor
with
a
carpet
upon
it
some
handsome
rugs
are
laid
down
there
are
two
marriage
chests
some
guns
and
swords
a
quantity
of
glass
teacups
and
ornaments
in
the
recesses
and
coloured
woodcuts
of
the
russian
imperial
family
here
as
in
almost
every
house
are
on
the
walls
there
is
great
rejoicing
for
joy
that
a
man
is
born
into
the
world
the
of
the
eldest
son
in
their
extreme
felicity
they
took
me
to
see
the
mother
and
babe
the
room
was
very
hot
and
crowded
with
relations
and
friends
the
young
mother
was
sitting
up
on
her
bed
on
the
floor
and
the
infant
lay
beside
her
dressed
in
swaddling
clothes
she
looked
very
happy
and
the
young
father
very
proud
i
added
a
small
offering
to
the
many
which
were
brought
in
for
luck
and
it
was
not
rejected
a
sword
was
brought
from
my
room
and
with
it
the
traced
a
line
upon
the
four
walls
repeating
a
formula
which
i
understood
to
be
i
am
making
this
tower
for
miriam
and
her
child
i
was
warned
by
hadji
not
to
look
on
the
child
or
to
admire
him
without
saying
mashallah
lest
i
should
bring
on
him
the
woe
of
the
evil
eye
so
greatly
is
it
feared
that
precautions
are
invariably
taken
against
it
from
the
hour
of
birth
by
bestowing
amulets
and
charms
upon
the
child
a
paragraph
of
the
koran
placed
in
a
silk
bag
had
already
been
tied
round
the
infant
neck
later
he
will
wear
another
bag
round
his
arm
and
turquoise
or
blue
beads
will
be
sewn
upon
his
cap
if
a
visitor
admires
a
child
without
uttering
the
word
and
the
child
afterwards
falls
sick
the
visitor
at
once
is
regarded
as
answerable
for
the
calamity
and
the
relations
take
a
shred
of
his
garment
and
burn
it
in
a
brazier
with
cress
seed
walking
round
and
round
the
child
as
it
burns
persian
mothers
are
regarded
as
convalescent
on
the
third
day
when
they
go
to
the
to
perform
the
ceremonies
required
by
moslem
law
a
boy
is
weaned
at
the
end
of
months
and
a
girl
at
the
end
of
if
possible
on
the
weaning
day
the
child
is
carried
to
the
mosque
and
certain
devotions
are
performed
the
weaning
feast
is
an
important
function
and
the
relations
and
friends
assemble
bringing
presents
and
the
child
in
spite
of
his
reluctance
is
forced
to
partake
of
the
food
at
the
earliest
possible
period
the
pronounces
in
the
infant
ear
the
shiah
profession
of
faith
god
is
god
there
is
but
one
god
and
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
and
ali
is
the
lieutenant
of
god
a
child
becomes
a
moslem
as
soon
as
this
has
been
spoken
into
his
ear
but
a
ceremony
attends
the
bestowal
of
his
name
which
resembles
that
in
use
among
the
buddhists
of
tibet
on
similar
occasions
unless
the
father
be
very
poor
indeed
he
makes
a
feast
for
his
friends
on
an
auspicious
day
and
invites
the
village
sweetmeats
are
solemnly
eaten
after
the
guests
have
assembled
then
the
infant
stiffened
and
mummied
in
its
swaddling
clothes
is
brought
in
and
is
laid
on
the
floor
by
one
of
the
five
names
are
written
on
five
slips
of
paper
which
are
placed
between
the
leaves
of
the
koran
or
under
the
edge
of
the
carpet
the
first
chapter
of
the
koran
is
then
read
one
of
the
slips
is
then
drawn
at
random
and
a
takes
up
the
child
and
pronounces
in
its
ear
the
name
found
upon
it
after
which
he
places
the
paper
on
its
clothes
the
relations
and
friends
give
it
presents
according
to
their
means
answering
to
our
christening
gifts
and
thereafter
it
is
called
by
the
name
it
has
received
among
men
names
there
is
a
preponderance
of
those
taken
from
the
old
testament
among
which
ibrahim
ismail
suleiman
yusuf
and
moussa
are
prominent
abdullah
mahmoud
hassan
raouf
baba
houssein
imam
are
also
common
and
many
names
have
the
suffix
of
ali
among
the
shiahs
fatmeh
is
a
woman
name
but
usually
receive
the
name
of
some
flower
or
bird
or
fascinating
quality
of
disposition
or
person
the
journey
is
beginning
to
tell
on
men
and
animals
one
of
the
arab
horses
has
had
a
violent
attack
of
pain
from
the
cold
and
several
of
the
men
are
ailing
and
depressed
nanej
is
the
last
village
laid
down
on
any
map
on
the
route
we
are
taking
for
over
a
hundred
miles
until
we
reach
k√ªm
though
it
is
a
caravan
route
and
it
does
not
appear
that
any
europeans
have
published
any
account
of
it
just
now
it
is
a
buried
country
for
the
snow
is
lying
from
one
to
four
feet
deep
it
is
not
even
possible
to
pronounce
any
verdict
on
the
roads
for
they
are
simply
deep
ruts
in
the
snow
with
mule
ladders
the
people
say
that
the
plains
are
irrigated
and
productive
and
that
the
hills
pasture
their
sheep
and
cattle
and
they
all
complain
of
the
exactions
of
local
officials
there
is
no
variety
in
costume
and
very
little
in
dwellings
except
as
to
size
for
they
are
all
built
of
mud
or
bricks
within
cattle
yards
and
have
subterranean
pens
for
cattle
and
goats
the
people
abound
in
diseases
specially
of
the
eyes
and
bones
the
salient
features
of
the
hills
if
they
have
any
are
rounded
off
by
snow
and
though
many
of
them
rise
to
a
great
height
none
are
really
impressive
but
mount
elwand
close
to
hamadan
the
route
is
altogether
hilly
but
the
track
pursues
valleys
and
low
passes
as
much
as
possible
and
is
never
really
steep
yesterday
we
marched
miles
in
eight
hours
without
any
incident
and
the
heavy
division
took
thirteen
hours
and
did
not
come
in
till
ten
at
night
there
are
round
hills
agglomerated
into
ranges
with
easy
passes
the
highest
feet
in
altitude
higher
summits
here
and
there
in
view
the
hills
encircling
level
plains
sprinkled
sparsely
with
villages
at
a
distance
from
the
road
denoted
by
scrubby
poplars
and
willows
sometimes
there
is
a
or
underground
irrigation
channel
with
a
line
of
pits
or
shafts
but
whatever
there
was
or
was
not
it
was
always
lonely
grim
and
desolate
the
strong
winds
have
blown
some
of
the
hillsides
bare
and
they
appear
in
all
their
deformity
of
shapeless
mounds
of
black
gravel
or
black
mud
with
relics
of
last
year
thistles
and
euphorbias
upon
them
so
great
is
the
destitution
of
fuel
that
even
now
people
are
out
cutting
the
stalks
of
thistles
which
appear
above
the
snow
as
the
hours
went
by
i
did
rather
wish
for
the
smashed
especially
when
we
met
the
ladies
of
a
governor
to
the
number
of
thirty
reclining
snugly
in
pairs
among
blankets
and
cushions
in
panniers
with
tilts
and
curtains
of
a
thick
material
dyed
turkey
red
the
cold
became
very
severe
towards
evening
the
geographical
interest
of
the
day
was
that
we
crossed
the
watershed
of
the
region
and
have
left
behind
the
streams
which
eventually
reach
the
sea
all
future
rivers
however
great
their
volume
or
impetuous
their
flow
disappearing
at
last
in
what
the
americans
call
sinks
but
which
are
known
in
persia
as
usually
salt
swamps
near
sunset
we
crossed
a
bridge
of
seven
pointed
arches
with
abutments
against
a
rapid
stream
and
passing
a
great
gaunt
caravanserai
on
an
eminence
and
a
valley
to
the
east
of
the
bridge
with
a
few
villages
giving
an
impression
of
fertility
hemmed
in
by
some
shapely
mountains
we
embarked
on
a
level
plain
bounded
on
all
sides
by
hills
so
snowy
that
not
a
brown
patch
or
outbreak
of
rock
spotted
their
whiteness
and
with
villages
and
caravanserais
scattered
thinly
over
it
on
the
left
there
are
the
extensive
ruins
of
old
dizabad
and
a
great
tract
of
forlorn
graves
clustering
round
a
crumbling
as
the
sun
sank
the
distant
hills
became
and
then
one
by
one
the
flush
died
off
into
the
paleness
of
death
and
in
the
gathering
in
desolation
without
sublimity
in
ghastliness
impressive
but
only
by
force
of
ghastliness
and
in
benumbing
cold
we
rode
into
this
village
and
into
a
yard
encumbered
with
mighty
piles
of
snow
on
one
side
of
which
i
have
a
wretched
room
though
the
best
with
two
doors
which
do
not
shut
but
when
they
are
closed
make
it
quite
dark
a
deep
damp
cobwebby
dusty
musty
lair
like
a
miserable
eastern
cowshed
i
was
really
and
quite
benumbed
and
though
i
had
plenty
of
blankets
and
furs
had
a
long
and
severe
chill
and
another
m
also
has
had
bad
chills
and
the
afghan
orderly
is
ill
and
moaning
with
pain
in
the
next
room
hadji
has
fallen
into
a
state
of
chronic
invalidism
and
is
shaking
with
chills
his
teeth
chattering
and
he
is
calling
on
allah
whenever
i
am
within
hearing
the
chilly
dampness
and
the
rise
in
temperature
again
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
ailments
but
i
think
that
we
europeans
are
suffering
from
the
want
of
nourishing
food
meat
has
not
been
attainable
for
some
days
the
fowls
are
dry
and
skinny
and
milk
is
very
scarce
and
poor
i
can
not
eat
the
sour
wafers
which
pass
for
bread
and
as
hadji
can
not
boil
rice
or
make
flour
porridge
i
often
start
in
the
morning
having
only
had
a
cup
of
tea
i
lunch
in
the
saddle
on
dates
the
milk
in
the
holsters
having
been
frozen
lately
then
is
the
time
for
finding
the
value
of
a
double
peppermint
lozenge
snow
fell
heavily
last
night
and
as
the
track
has
not
been
broken
and
the
dared
not
face
it
we
are
detained
in
this
miserable
place
four
other
caravans
sharing
our
fate
the
pros
and
cons
about
starting
were
many
and
abbas
khan
was
sent
on
horseback
to
reconnoitre
but
he
came
back
like
noah
dove
reporting
that
it
was
a
trackless
waste
of
snow
outside
it
is
a
day
of
rest
but
as
the
door
has
to
be
open
on
the
snow
to
let
in
light
my
hands
are
benumbed
with
the
damp
cold
still
a
bowl
of
edwards
desiccated
soup
the
best
of
all
travelling
soups
has
been
very
reviving
and
though
i
have
had
a
severe
chill
again
i
do
not
mean
to
succumb
i
do
not
dwell
on
the
hardships
but
they
are
awful
the
soldiers
and
servants
all
have
bad
coughs
and
dwindle
daily
the
little
orderly
is
so
ill
that
we
could
not
have
gone
on
even
had
the
track
been
broken
unladen
asses
followed
by
unladen
mules
were
driven
along
to
break
the
track
this
morning
and
as
two
caravans
started
before
us
it
was
tolerable
though
very
deep
the
solitude
and
desolation
were
awful
at
first
the
snow
was
somewhat
thawed
but
soon
it
became
immensely
deep
and
we
had
to
plunge
through
hollows
from
which
the
beasts
extricated
themselves
with
great
difficulty
and
occasionally
had
to
be
unloaded
and
reloaded
as
i
mentioned
in
writing
of
an
earlier
march
it
is
difficult
and
even
dangerous
to
pass
caravans
when
the
only
road
is
a
deep
rut
a
foot
wide
and
we
had
most
tedious
experience
of
it
when
some
of
our
men
weakened
by
illness
were
not
so
patient
as
usual
abbas
khan
and
the
orderly
could
hardly
sit
on
their
horses
and
hadji
rolled
off
his
mule
at
intervals
as
the
who
give
way
have
their
beasts
floundering
in
the
deep
snow
and
losing
their
loads
both
attempt
to
keep
the
road
the
result
of
which
is
a
violent
collision
the
two
animals
which
collide
usually
go
down
and
some
of
the
others
come
on
the
top
of
them
and
at
one
time
there
were
eight
struggling
heels
uppermost
in
the
deep
snow
all
to
be
reloaded
this
led
to
a
serious
the
rival
aggravated
by
hadji
struck
him
on
the
head
and
down
he
went
into
the
snow
with
his
mule
apparently
on
the
top
of
him
and
his
load
at
some
distance
the
same
seized
the
halters
of
several
of
our
mules
and
drove
them
into
the
snow
where
they
all
came
to
grief
our
whose
blue
eyes
auburn
hair
and
beard
and
exceeding
beauty
always
bring
to
mind
a
sacred
picture
became
furious
at
this
and
there
was
a
fierce
fight
among
the
men
m
being
ahead
and
much
bad
language
such
epithets
as
son
of
a
dog
and
sons
of
burnt
fathers
being
freely
bandied
about
the
fray
at
last
died
out
leaving
as
its
result
only
the
loss
of
an
hour
some
broken
surcingles
and
some
bleeding
faces
even
hadji
rose
from
his
gory
bed
not
much
worse
though
he
had
been
hit
hard
there
was
no
more
quarrelling
though
we
passed
several
caravans
but
even
when
the
men
were
reasonable
and
good
nature
prevailed
some
of
the
mules
on
both
sides
fell
in
the
snow
and
had
to
be
reloaded
when
the
matter
is
not
settled
as
this
was
by
violence
a
good
deal
of
shouting
and
roaring
culminates
in
an
understanding
that
one
caravan
shall
draw
off
into
a
place
where
the
snow
is
shallowest
and
stand
still
till
the
other
has
gone
past
but
scarcely
a
shallow
place
could
be
found
i
always
give
place
to
asses
rather
to
avoid
a
painful
spectacle
than
from
humanity
one
step
off
the
track
and
down
they
go
and
they
never
get
up
without
being
unloaded
when
we
left
dizabad
the
mist
was
thick
and
as
it
cleared
it
froze
in
crystallised
buttons
which
covered
the
surface
of
the
snow
but
lifting
only
partially
it
revealed
snowy
summits
above
heavy
white
clouds
then
when
we
reached
a
broad
plateau
the
highest
plain
of
the
journey
feet
in
altitude
gray
mists
drifted
very
near
us
and
opening
in
rifts
divulged
blackness
darkness
and
tempest
and
ragged
peaks
exposed
to
the
fury
of
a
snowstorm
snow
fell
in
showers
on
the
plain
and
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
had
the
storm
which
seemed
impending
burst
on
that
wild
awful
shelterless
expanse
with
tired
animals
and
every
landmark
obliterated
some
of
us
must
have
perished
i
have
done
a
great
deal
of
snow
travelling
and
know
how
soon
every
trace
of
even
the
widest
and
deepest
path
is
effaced
by
drift
much
more
the
narrow
rut
by
which
we
were
crossing
this
most
exposed
plateau
there
was
not
a
village
in
sight
the
whole
march
no
birds
no
animals
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
venomous
hiss
of
squalls
it
was
the
dead
of
winter
my
admirable
mule
was
ill
of
cold
from
having
my
small
saddle
on
him
instead
of
his
great
stuffed
the
said
and
he
gave
me
instead
a
horse
that
i
could
not
ride
such
a
gait
i
never
felt
less
than
half
a
mile
was
unbearable
i
felt
as
if
my
eyes
would
be
shaken
out
of
their
sockets
the
bit
was
changed
but
in
vain
i
was
obliged
to
get
off
and
m
kindly
put
my
saddle
on
a
powerful
kirmanshah
arab
i
soon
found
that
my
intense
fatigue
on
this
journey
had
been
caused
by
riding
mules
which
have
no
elasticity
of
movement
i
rode
twenty
miles
with
ease
and
could
have
ridden
twenty
more
and
had
several
canters
on
the
few
places
where
the
snow
was
well
trodden
i
was
off
the
track
trying
to
get
past
a
caravan
and
overtake
the
others
when
down
came
the
horse
and
i
in
a
drift
fully
ten
feet
deep
somehow
i
was
not
quite
detached
from
the
saddle
and
in
the
scrimmage
got
into
it
again
and
a
few
desperate
plunges
brought
us
out
with
the
horse
breastplate
broken
when
we
reached
the
great
plateau
above
this
village
a
great
blank
sheet
of
snow
surrounded
by
mountains
now
buried
in
white
mists
now
revealed
with
snow
flurries
drifting
wildly
round
their
ghastly
heads
i
found
that
the
arab
the
same
horse
which
was
so
ill
at
nanej
was
dead
beat
and
as
it
only
looked
a
mile
to
the
village
i
got
off
and
walked
in
the
deep
snow
along
the
rungs
of
the
mule
ladders
which
are
so
fatiguing
for
horses
but
the
distance
was
fully
three
miles
with
a
stream
to
wade
through
half
a
mile
of
deep
wet
soil
to
plunge
through
and
the
thawed
mud
of
a
large
village
to
splash
through
and
as
i
dared
not
mount
again
for
fear
of
catching
cold
i
trailed
forlornly
into
saruk
following
the
men
who
were
riding
can
it
be
said
that
they
rode
they
sat
feebly
on
animals
swaddled
in
felts
and
furs
the
concealing
each
face
with
the
exception
of
one
eye
in
a
blue
goggle
rolling
from
side
to
side
clutching
at
ropes
and
halters
moaning
allah
a
deplorable
cavalcade
saruk
has
some
poplars
and
is
surrounded
by
a
ruinous
mud
wall
it
is
a
village
of
houses
and
is
famous
for
very
fine
velvety
carpets
of
small
patterns
in
vivid
vegetable
dyes
at
an
altitude
of
feet
it
has
a
severe
climate
and
only
grows
wheat
and
barley
sown
in
april
and
reaped
in
september
all
this
mountainous
region
that
we
are
toiling
through
is
blank
on
the
maps
and
may
be
a
dead
level
so
far
as
anything
there
is
represented
though
even
its
passes
are
in
several
cases
over
feet
high
the
circumstances
generally
are
unfavourable
and
we
are
again
detained
the
afghan
orderly
who
is
also
interpreter
is
very
ill
and
though
he
is
very
plucky
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
move
the
cook
seems
all
to
pieces
and
is
overcome
by
cough
and
lassitude
abbas
khan
is
ill
and
his
face
has
lost
its
comicality
and
in
the
same
room
hadji
lies
groaning
and
moaning
that
he
will
not
live
through
the
night
even
m
herculean
strength
is
not
what
it
was
i
have
chills
but
in
spite
of
them
and
the
fatigue
am
really
much
better
than
when
i
left
baghdad
so
that
though
i
exercise
the
privilege
of
grumbling
at
the
hardships
i
ought
not
to
complain
of
them
though
they
are
enough
to
break
down
the
strongest
men
i
really
like
the
journey
except
when
i
am
completely
knocked
up
or
the
smoke
is
exceptionally
blinding
the
snow
in
this
yard
is
lying
in
masses
twelve
feet
high
rising
out
of
slush
i
do
not
know
how
many
feet
deep
it
looks
as
if
we
had
seen
the
last
of
the
winter
the
mercury
is
at
now
it
is
very
damp
and
cold
sitting
in
a
room
with
one
side
open
to
the
snow
and
the
mud
floor
all
slush
from
the
drip
from
the
roof
the
fuel
is
wet
and
though
a
man
has
attempted
four
times
to
light
a
fire
he
has
only
succeeded
in
making
an
overpowering
smoke
which
prefers
hanging
heavily
over
the
floor
and
me
to
making
its
exit
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
provided
for
it
the
door
must
be
kept
open
to
let
in
light
and
it
also
lets
in
fowls
and
many
cats
my
has
been
trampled
into
the
slush
and
a
deadly
cold
strikes
up
through
it
last
night
a
man
for
hadji
was
de
brought
in
some
live
embers
and
heaped
some
gum
tragacanth
thorns
and
animal
fuel
upon
them
there
was
no
chimney
and
the
hole
in
the
roof
was
stopped
by
a
clod
the
result
was
unbearable
i
covered
my
head
with
blankets
but
it
was
still
blinding
and
stifling
and
i
had
to
extinguish
the
fire
with
water
and
bear
the
cold
which
then
was
about
later
there
was
a
tempest
of
snow
and
rain
with
a
sudden
thaw
and
water
dripped
with
an
irksome
sound
on
my
bed
no
light
would
burn
and
i
had
the
mortification
of
knowing
that
the
same
drip
was
spoiling
writing
paper
and
stores
which
had
been
left
open
to
dry
but
a
traveller
rarely
lies
awake
and
by
keeping
my
feet
on
a
box
and
living
in
a
mackintosh
i
am
out
of
both
drip
and
mud
such
a
room
as
i
am
now
in
is
the
ordinary
room
of
a
persian
homestead
it
is
a
cell
of
mud
not
brick
either
sun
or
kiln
dried
its
sides
are
cracked
and
let
in
air
its
roof
is
mud
under
which
is
some
brushwood
lying
over
the
rafters
it
has
no
light
holes
but
as
the
door
has
shrunk
considerably
from
the
door
posts
it
is
not
absolutely
dark
it
may
be
about
twelve
feet
square
every
part
of
it
is
blackened
by
years
of
smoke
the
best
of
it
is
that
it
is
raised
two
feet
from
the
ground
to
admit
of
a
below
and
opens
on
a
rough
platform
which
runs
in
front
of
all
the
with
the
misfitting
door
and
cracked
sides
it
is
much
like
a
sieve
i
have
waited
to
describe
a
persian
peasant
house
till
i
had
seen
more
of
them
the
yard
is
an
almost
unvarying
feature
whether
a
small
enclosure
with
a
low
wall
and
a
gateway
closed
at
night
by
a
screen
of
reeds
or
a
great
farmyard
like
this
with
an
arched
entrance
and
for
two
or
three
generations
along
one
or
more
of
the
sides
the
house
walls
are
built
of
mud
not
brick
and
are
only
one
story
high
the
soil
near
villages
is
mostly
mud
and
by
leading
water
to
a
given
spot
a
pit
of
mortar
for
building
material
is
at
once
made
this
being
dug
up
and
worked
to
a
proper
consistency
by
the
feet
of
men
is
then
made
into
a
wall
piece
after
piece
being
laid
on
by
hand
till
it
reaches
a
height
of
four
feet
and
a
thickness
of
three
the
imperative
tradition
of
the
persian
builder
this
is
allowed
a
few
days
for
hardening
when
another
layer
of
similar
height
but
somewhat
narrower
is
laid
upon
it
or
recesses
a
foot
deep
or
more
being
worked
into
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
the
process
is
repeated
till
the
desired
height
is
attained
when
the
wall
is
thoroughly
dry
it
is
plastered
inside
and
outside
with
a
mixture
of
mud
and
chopped
straw
and
if
this
plastering
is
repeated
at
intervals
the
style
of
construction
is
very
durable
the
oven
or
nd
is
placed
in
the
floor
of
one
room
at
least
and
answers
for
cooking
and
heating
a
peasant
house
has
no
windows
and
the
roof
does
not
project
beyond
the
wall
all
roofs
are
flat
rude
rafters
of
poplar
are
laid
across
the
walls
about
two
feet
apart
in
a
or
a
wealthier
house
above
these
are
laid
in
rows
peeled
poplar
rods
two
inches
apart
then
a
rush
mat
and
then
the
resinous
thorns
of
the
tragacanth
bush
which
are
not
liable
to
decay
but
in
the
poorer
houses
the
owner
contents
himself
with
a
coarse
reed
mat
or
a
layer
of
brushwood
above
the
rafters
on
this
is
spread
a
layer
of
mud
then
eight
or
ten
inches
of
dry
earth
and
the
whole
is
thickly
plastered
with
mixed
straw
and
mud
a
slight
slope
at
the
back
with
a
long
wooden
spout
carries
off
the
water
such
a
roof
is
impervious
to
rain
except
in
very
severe
storms
if
kept
in
order
that
is
if
it
be
plastered
once
a
year
and
well
rolled
after
rain
few
people
are
so
poor
as
not
to
have
a
stone
roller
on
their
roofs
if
this
is
lacking
the
roof
must
be
well
tramped
after
rain
by
bare
feet
and
in
all
cases
the
snow
must
be
shovelled
off
these
roofs
among
the
peasantry
have
no
parapets
they
are
the
paradise
of
dogs
and
in
hot
weather
the
people
take
up
their
beds
and
sleep
there
partly
for
coolness
and
partly
because
the
night
breeze
gives
freedom
from
mosquitos
in
simple
country
life
though
the
premises
of
the
peasants
for
the
sake
of
security
are
contiguous
there
are
seldom
even
balustrades
to
the
roofs
though
in
summer
most
domestic
operations
are
carried
on
there
fifty
years
ago
persian
law
sanctioned
the
stoning
without
trial
or
mercy
of
any
one
caught
in
the
act
of
gazing
into
the
premises
of
another
unless
the
gazer
were
the
king
upon
the
courtyard
stables
barns
and
open
but
so
far
i
notice
that
the
granary
is
in
the
house
and
that
the
clay
receptacles
for
grain
are
in
the
looking
from
above
upon
a
plain
the
poplars
which
surround
villages
where
there
is
a
sufficiency
of
water
attract
the
eye
at
this
season
they
are
nothing
but
a
brown
patch
on
the
snow
the
villages
themselves
are
of
light
brown
mud
and
are
surrounded
usually
by
square
walls
with
towers
at
the
corners
and
all
have
a
great
gate
within
the
houses
or
hovels
the
families
are
huddled
irregularly
with
all
their
appurtenances
and
in
winter
the
flocks
and
herds
are
in
subterranean
pens
beneath
in
summer
the
animals
go
forth
at
sunrise
and
return
at
sunset
the
walls
which
give
most
of
the
villages
a
fortified
aspect
used
to
afford
the
villagers
a
degree
of
protection
against
the
predatory
turkomans
and
now
give
security
to
the
flocks
against
lur
and
other
robbers
every
village
has
its
or
headman
who
is
answerable
for
the
taxes
the
safety
of
travellers
and
other
matters
the
men
being
a
little
better
we
left
saruk
at
nine
on
the
i
on
a
bright
little
baghdadi
horse
in
such
good
case
that
he
frequently
threw
up
his
heels
in
happy
playfulness
the
temperature
had
fallen
considerably
there
had
been
a
fresh
snowfall
and
the
day
was
very
bright
the
arab
horses
are
suffering
badly
in
their
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
snow
if
i
had
not
had
such
a
lively
little
horse
i
should
have
found
the
march
a
tedious
one
for
we
were
six
hours
in
doing
eleven
and
a
half
miles
on
a
level
the
head
had
gone
on
early
to
make
some
arrangements
and
the
others
loaded
the
animals
so
badly
that
hadji
and
the
cook
rolled
off
their
mules
into
the
deep
slush
from
the
packs
turning
just
outside
the
gates
we
had
three
mules
with
us
with
tackle
and
the
loads
rolled
over
many
times
the
riders
who
were
too
weak
to
help
themselves
getting
bad
falls
as
each
load
owing
to
the
broken
tackle
took
fifteen
minutes
to
put
on
again
and
the
men
could
do
little
a
great
deal
of
hard
exasperating
work
fell
on
m
after
one
bad
fall
in
a
snowdrift
myself
i
rode
on
alone
with
one
mule
with
a
valuable
burden
this
turning
for
the
fourth
time
was
soon
under
his
body
and
he
began
to
kick
violently
quite
dismaying
me
by
the
bang
of
his
hoofs
against
cases
containing
scientific
instruments
it
was
a
droll
comedy
in
the
snow
i
wanted
to
get
hold
of
his
halter
but
every
time
i
went
near
him
he
whisked
round
and
flung
up
his
heels
till
i
managed
to
cut
the
ragged
surcingle
and
set
him
free
when
i
caught
him
in
deep
snow
in
which
my
horse
was
very
unwilling
to
risk
himself
soon
after
leaving
saruk
which
as
i
mentioned
before
is
famous
for
very
fine
carpets
we
descended
gently
upon
the
great
plain
of
feraghan
perhaps
the
largest
district
of
persia
these
carpets
are
very
fine
and
their
patterns
are
unique
bringing
a
very
high
price
this
plain
has
an
altitude
of
about
feet
is
miles
in
length
by

is
officially
stated
to
have
villages
upon
it
all
agricultural
and
carpet
producing
and
is
considerably
irrigated
by
streams
which
eventually
lose
themselves
in
a
salt
lake
at
its
eastern
extremity
it
is
surrounded
by
hills
with
mountain
ranges
behind
them
and
must
be
both
as
to
productiveness
and
population
one
of
the
most
flourishing
districts
in
persia
we
were
to
have
marched
to
kashgird
but
on
reaching
the
hamlet
of
ahang
garang
i
found
that
abbas
khan
had
taken
quarters
there
saying
that
kashgird
was
in
ruins
hadji
who
had
allowed
himself
to
roll
off
several
times
was
moaning
and
weeping
on
the
floor
of
my
room
groaning
out
with
many
cries
of
let
me
stay
here
till
i
better
i
do
want
any
wages
i
shall
be
killed
oh
killed
oh
my
family
i
shall
never
see
bushire
any
more
though
there
was
much
reason
to
think
he
was
shamming
i
did
the
little
that
he
calls
his
work
and
left
him
to
smoke
his
opium
pipe
and
sleep
by
the
fire
in
peace
i
was
threatened
with
in
one
eye
in
fact
i
saw
nothing
with
it
and
had
to
keep
it
covered
up
one
of
the
lay
moaning
outside
my
room
poor
fellow
taking
chlorodyne
every
and
another
had
got
a
bad
foot
from
they
have
been
terribly
exposed
and
the
soft
snow
at
a
higher
temperature
has
been
worse
for
them
than
the
dry
powdery
snow
at
a
low
temperature
as
it
soaks
their
socks
shoes
and
leggings
and
then
freezes
making
liebig
beef
tea
warms
one
and
they
like
it
even
from
a
christian
hand
the
afghan
orderly
bore
up
bravely
but
was
very
weak
indeed
the
prospect
of
getting
these
men
to
tihran
is
darkening
daily
my
room
though
open
to
the
snow
at
one
end
was
comfortable
the
oven
had
been
lighted
twelve
hours
before
and
it
was
delightful
to
hang
one
feet
into
the
warm
hole
there
were
holes
for
light
in
the
roof
and
cold
though
it
was
so
long
as
daylight
lasted
these
were
never
free
from
veiled
faces
looking
down
in
order
to
become
thoroughly
warm
it
was
necessary
to
walk
long
and
briskly
on
the
roof
and
this
brought
all
the
villagers
below
it
to
stare
the
stare
of
vacuity
rather
than
of
curiosity
a
snow
scene
is
always
beautiful
at
sunset
and
this
was
exceptionally
so
as
the
long
indigo
shadows
on
the
plain
threw
into
greater
definiteness
the
gleaming
glittering
hills
at
one
time
dazzling
in
the
sunshine
at
another
flushed
in
the
sunset
the
plain
of
feraghan
as
seen
from
the
roof
was
one
smooth
expanse
of
pure
deep
snow
broken
only
by
brown
splashes
where
mud
villages
were
emphasised
by
brown
poplars
the
unbroken
unsullied
snow
two
feet
deep
on
the
level
and
any
number
in
the
drifts
looking
like
a
picture
of
the
arctic
ocean
magnificent
in
its
solitude
one
difficult
track
a
foot
wide
the
solitary
link
with
the
larger
world
which
then
seemed
so
very
far
away
things
went
better
yesterday
on
the
whole
though
the
mercury
fell
to
zero
in
the
night
and
i
was
awakened
several
times
by
the
cold
of
my
open
room
and
when
a
number
of
people
came
at
daylight
for
medicines
my
fingers
were
so
benumbed
that
i
could
scarcely
measure
them
what
a
splendid
field
for
a
medical
missionary
loving
his
profession
this
plain
with
its
villages
would
be
where
there
are
curable
diseases
by
the
hundred
many
of
the
suffering
people
have
told
me
that
they
would
give
lodging
and
the
best
of
their
food
to
any
english
doctor
who
would
travel
among
them
the
loads
were
well
balanced
yesterday
and
hadji
only
pulled
his
over
once
and
only
rolled
off
once
when
abbas
khan
exclaimed
he
not
a
man
why
did
allah
make
such
a
creature
we
got
off
at
nine
the
roofs
being
crowded
to
see
us
start
fuel
is
very
scarce
at
ahang
garang
for
the
cooking
and
parlour
fire
the
charge
was
or
about
shillings
probably
this
included
a
large
for
a
room
from
two
to
four
is
expected
through
m
kindness
i
now
have
a
good
horse
to
ride
and
the
difference
in
fatigue
is
incredible
we
embarked
again
on
the
vast
plain
of
snow
it
was
a
grim
day
and
most
ghastly
and
desolate
this
end
of
the
plain
looked
where
the
waters
having
done
their
fertilising
work
are
lost
in
a
salt
lake
the
absolutely
white
hills
round
the
plain
being
emphasised
by
the
blue
neutral
tint
of
the
sky
for
the
first
ten
miles
there
was
little
more
than
a
breeze
for
the
last
ten
a
pitiless
ruthless
riotous
gale
blowing
up
the
snow
in
hissing
drifts
as
it
swept
across
the
plain
with
a
desolate
screech
the
coverings
with
which
we
were
swaddled
were
soon
penetrated
the
cold
seemed
to
enter
the
bones
and
to
strike
the
head
and
face
like
a
hammer
stunning
as
it
struck
the
tears
wrung
from
the
eyes
were
frozen
at
times
even
the
eyelids
were
frozen
together
the
frozen
snow
hit
one
hard
hands
and
feet
were
by
turns
benumbed
and
in
anguish
terrific
blasts
loaded
with
hard
lumps
of
snow
came
down
from
the
hills
snow
was
drifting
from
all
the
white
ranges
above
us
on
the
more
exposed
part
of
the
track
the
gusts
burst
with
such
violence
as
to
force
some
of
the
mules
off
it
to
flounder
in
the
deep
snow
my
arab
was
struck
so
mercilessly
on
his
sore
swollen
eyes
that
at
times
i
could
scarcely
with
my
own
useless
hands
induce
him
to
face
the
swirls
of
frozen
snow
swifter
and
more
resistless
were
the
squalls
more
and
more
obliterated
became
the
track
till
after
a
fight
of
over
three
hours
and
the
ceaseless
crossing
of
rolling
hills
and
deep
hollows
we
reached
the
top
of
a
slope
feet
in
altitude
and
saw
this
village
looking
from
that
distance
quite
imposing
on
a
hill
on
the
other
side
of
a
stream
crossed
by
a
brick
bridge
with
a
ruined
fort
on
a
height
above
it
it
promised
shelter
that
was
all
below
the
village
there
was
an
expanse
of
snow
sloping
up
to
pure
white
hills
outlined
against
an
indigo
depth
of
clouds
while
m
went
up
a
hill
for
some
scientific
work
i
followed
the
orderly
who
could
scarcely
sit
on
his
horse
from
pain
and
weakness
into
the
most
wretchedly
ruinous
village
i
have
yet
seen
epitomising
the
disenchantment
which
a
near
view
of
an
eastern
city
brings
and
up
a
steep
alley
to
a
ruinous
yard
heaped
with
ruins
on
one
side
of
which
were
some
ruinous
rooms
their
backs
opening
on
a
precipice
above
the
river
and
on
the
wind
i
tumbled
off
my
horse
abbas
khan
the
least
sick
of
the
men
with
benumbed
hands
breaking
my
fall
the
severe
cold
had
stiffened
all
my
joints
we
could
scarcely
speak
the
bones
of
my
face
were
in
intense
pain
and
i
felt
as
if
the
cold
were
congealing
my
heart
with
abbas
khan
help
i
chose
the
rooms
the
worst
we
have
ever
had
the
one
i
took
for
myself
has
an
door
facing
the
wind
and
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
fire
for
the
draught
blows
sticks
ashes
and
embers
over
the
room
the
others
are
worse
it
is
an
awful
night
blowing
and
snowing
all
the
men
but
two
are
de
the
poor
orderly
using
an
afghan
phrase
said
the
wind
has
played
the
demon
with
me
he
has
a
fearful
cough
and
h√¶morrhage
from
the
lungs
or
throat
the
cook
is
threatened
with
pleurisy
it
may
truly
be
called
hospital
sunday
the
day
has
been
chiefly
spent
in
making
mustard
poultices
which
m
is
constantly
crossing
the
yard
in
three
feet
of
snow
to
put
on
and
protectors
for
the
chests
and
backs
preparing
beef
tea
making
up
medicines
etc
surely
things
must
have
reached
their
worst
out
of
seven
men
only
one
servant
and
he
an
indian
lad
with
a
fearful
squint
and
eyes
so
badly
inflamed
that
he
can
hardly
see
where
he
puts
things
down
is
able
to
do
anything
two
of
the
are
lying
ill
in
the
stable
mustard
plasters
dover
powders
salicylate
of
soda
emetics
poultices
clinical
thermometers
chlorodyne
and
beef
tea
have
been
in
requisition
all
day
the
cook
the
afghan
orderly
and
hadji
seem
really
at
eight
this
morning
groans
at
my
door
took
me
out
and
one
of
the
muleteers
was
lying
there
in
severe
pain
with
the
hard
fine
snow
beating
on
him
later
i
heard
fresh
moaning
on
my
threshold
and
found
hadji
fallen
there
with
my
breakfast
i
got
him
in
and
he
fell
again
upsetting
the
tea
and
while
i
attended
to
him
the
big
dogs
ate
up
the
he
had
a
good
deal
of
fever
and
severe
rheumatism
and
on
looking
at
his
eyes
i
saw
that
he
was
nearly
blind
he
lost
his
blue
glasses
some
days
ago
i
sent
him
to
bed
in
the
kitchen
for
the
whole
day
where
he
lay
groaning
in
comfort
by
the
fire
with
his
opium
pipe
and
his
tea
he
thinks
he
will
not
survive
the
night
and
has
just
given
me
his
dying
directions
afterwards
m
came
for
the
thermometer
and
chlorodyne
and
remarked
that
my
room
was
unfit
for
a
beast
the
truth
is
i
share
it
with
several
very
big
dogs
it
did
look
grotesquely
miserable
last
night
black
fireless
wet
dirty
with
all
my
things
lying
on
the
dirty
floor
having
been
tumbled
about
by
these
dogs
in
their
search
for
my
last
box
of
brand
meat
lozenges
which
they
got
out
of
a
strong
bag
which
they
tore
into
strips
on
going
for
my
fur
cloak
these
three
dogs
who
i
believe
would
take
on
civilisation
more
quickly
than
their
masters
were
all
found
rolled
up
under
it
and
lying
on
my
bed
the
mercury
in
the
parlour
with
a
large
fire
can
not
be
raised
above
in
my
room
the
wet
floor
is
frozen
hard
and
the
mercury
is
this
is
nothing
after
and
below
zero
but
the
furious
east
wind
and
a
singular
dampness
in
the
air
make
it
very
severe
yesterday
before
the
sky
clouded
over
there
was
a
most
remarkable
ring
or
halo
of
prismatic
colours
round
the
sun
ominous
of
the
storm
which
has
followed
this
place
standing
high
without
shelter
is
fearfully
exposed
there
is
no
milk
and
no
comfort
of
any
kind
for
the
sick
men
we
have
decided
to
wrap
them
up
and
move
them
to
k√ªm
where
there
is
a
persian
doctor
with
a
european
education
but
it
is
a
great
risk
though
the
lesser
of
two
i
have
just
finished
four
protectors
for
the
back
and
chest
of
a
yard
long
by
sixteen
inches
wide
buttoning
on
the
shoulders
of
a
very
soft
felt
nearly
half
an
inch
thick
a
precaution
much
to
be
commended
i
think
that
hadji
though
in
great
pain
poor
fellow
is
partly
shamming
he
professed
this
evening
to
have
violent
fever
and
the
thermometer
shows
that
he
has
none
even
the
few
things
which
i
thought
he
had
done
for
me
such
as
making
i
find
have
been
done
by
others
it
is
a
pity
for
himself
as
well
as
for
me
that
he
should
be
so
incorrigibly
lazy
khatan
yesterday
we
had
a
severe
march
and
owing
first
to
the
depth
of
the
snow
and
then
to
the
depth
of
the
mud
we
were
seven
hours
in
doing
miles
the
wind
was
still
intensely
cold
bitter
indeed
there
are
few
remarks
to
be
made
about
a
country
buried
in
snow
the
early
miles
were
across
the
fag
end
of
the
dazzling
plain
of
feraghan
which
instead
of
being
covered
with
villages
is
an
uninhabited
desert
with
a
salt
lake
then
the
road
winds
among
mountains
of
an
altitude
of
and
feet
and
more
its
highest
point
being
feet
where
we
began
a
descent
which
will
land
us
at
tihran
at
a
level
under
feet
snowy
mountains
and
snowy
plains
were
behind
bare
brown
earth
was
to
come
all
too
soon
winding
wearily
round
low
hills
meeting
caravans
of
camels
to
which
we
had
to
give
way
and
of
asses
floundering
in
the
snow
we
came
in
the
evening
to
a
broad
slope
with
villages
poplars
walnuts
and
irrigated
lands
then
to
the
large
and
picturesquely
situated
village
of
givr
on
a
steep
bank
above
a
rapid
stream
and
just
at
dusk
to
the
important
village
of
jairud
also
on
high
ground
above
the
same
river
and
surrounded
by
gardens
and
an
extraordinary
number
of
fruit
trees
the
altitude
is
feet
i
had
a
very
cold
and
was
fairly
benumbed
for
some
time
after
the
long
cold
march
a
great
many
people
applied
for
medicine
and
some
of
the
maladies
specially
when
they
affect
children
make
one
sick
at
heart
hadji
is
affecting
to
be
stone
deaf
so
he
no
longer
interprets
for
sick
people
which
creates
an
additional
difficulty
we
left
this
morning
at
ten
descended
feet
and
suddenly
left
the
snow
behind
vast
gray
and
grim
the
mountains
looked
as
they
receded
into
indigo
gloom
with
snow
clouds
drifting
round
their
ghastly
heads
and
across
the
dazzling
snow
plains
in
which
we
had
been
floundering
for
thirty
days
it
is
strange
to
see
mother
earth
once
more
rocky
or
rather
stony
hills
mud
hills
mud
plains
mud
slopes
a
brown
world
with
a
snow
world
above
two
pink
hills
rise
above
the
brown
plain
and
some
toothed
peaks
but
the
rest
of
the
view
is
simply
hills
and
slopes
of
mud
and
gravel
bearing
thorns
and
the
relics
of
last
year
thistles
and
wormwood
the
atmospheric
colouring
is
however
very
fine
illustration
persian
this
is
a
large
village
with
beehive
roofs
in
and
of
mud
a
quagmire
surrounds
it
and
is
in
the
centre
of
it
and
the
crumbling
houses
are
thrown
promiscuously
down
upon
it
it
is
nearly
the
roughest
place
i
have
seen
and
the
worst
accommodation
though
abbas
khan
says
it
is
the
best
house
in
the
village
my
room
has
an
oven
in
the
floor
neatly
lined
with
clay
and
as
i
write
the
women
are
making
bread
by
a
very
simple
process
the
oven
is
well
heated
by
the
live
embers
of
animal
fuel
they
work
the
flour
and
water
dough
to
which
a
piece
of
leaven
from
the
last
baking
has
been
added
into
a
flat
round
cake
about
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
and
half
an
inch
thick
place
it
quickly
on
a
very
dirty
cushion
and
clap
it
against
the
concave
interior
of
the
oven
withdrawing
the
cushion
in
one
minute
it
is
baked
and
removed

sloping
hole
in
the
floor
leads
to
the
the
skin
of
a
sheep

up
a
pack

and
gear

up
one
corner
my
bed
another
and
the
owner
miscellaneous
property
fills
up
the
rest
of
the
blackened
cracked
mud
hovel
thick
with
the
sooty
cobwebs
and
dust
of
generations
the
door
which
can
only
be
shut
by
means
of
a
wooden
bolt
outside
is
six
inches
from
the
ground
so
that
fowls
and
cats
run
in
and
out
with
impunity
behind
my
bed
there
is
a
doorless
entrance
to
a
dark
den
full
of
goat
hair
bones
and
other
stores
in
front
there
is
a
round
hole
for
letting
in
light
which
i
persistently
fill
up
with
a
blanket
which
is
as
persistently
withdrawn
there
is
no
privacy
for
though
the
people
are
glad
to
let
their
rooms
they
only
partially
vacate
them
and
are
in
and
out
all
the
time
outside
there
is
mud
a
foot
deep
then
a
steep
slope
and
a
disgusting
green
pool
and
the
drinking
water
is
nauseous
and
brackish

here

everywhere
seem
of
a
very
harmless
sort

leaving
only
two
men
to
load
twelve
mules
m
practically
had
to
load
them
himself
and
to
reload
them
when
the
tackle
broke
and
the
loads
turned
hadji
and
the
cook
were
quite
incapable
the
afghan
orderly
who
seemed
like
a
dying
man
was
left
behind
in
fact
there
were
no
servants
and
no
interpreters
and
the
groom
was
so
ill
he
could
hardly
sit
on
a
horse
the
march
of
miles
took
fully
eight
hours
but
on
the
arab
horse
and
with
an
occasional
gallop
i
got
through
quite
comfortably
and
have
nothing
to
complain
of
the
road
lies
through
a
country
of
mud
hills
brown
usually
drab
sometimes
streaked
with
deep
madder
red
and
occasionally
pale
green
clay
stones
thistles
and
thorns
their
only
crop
i
passed
over
much
of
this
country
in
the
spring
and
though
there
were
a
few
flowers
chiefly
bulbs
and
the
thorns
were
clothed
with
a
scanty
leafage
and
the
thistles
and
artemisia
were
instead
of
buff
the
general
aspect
of
the
region
was
the
same
there
was
not
a
village
on
the
route
only
two
or
three
heaps
of
deserted
ruins
and
two
or
three
ruinous
mud
no
cultivation
streams
or
springs
the
scanty
pools
brackish
here
and
there
the
glittering
whiteness
of
saline
efflorescence
not
a
tree
or
even
bush
nothing
living
except
a
few
goats
picking
up
who
knows
how
a
scanty
living
a
blighted
blasted
region
a
land
without

then
came
low
mud
ranges
somewhat
glorified
by
atmosphere
higher
hills
on
the
left
ghastly
with
snow
which
was
even
then
falling
glimpses
far
away
to
the
northward
of
snowy
mountains
among
heavy
masses
of
sunlit
clouds
an
ascent
a
gap
in
the
mud
hills
some
low
peaks
of
white
green
and
red
clay
a
great
plain
partly
green
with
springing
wheat
and
in
the
centre
in
the
glow
of
sunset
the
golden
dome
and
graceful
minarets
of
the
shrine
of
fatima
the
sister
of
reza
groups
of
trees
and
the
mud
houses
mud
walls
and
many
domes
and
minarets
of
the
sacred
city
of
k√ªm
descending
we
trotted
for
some
miles
through
irrigated
wheat
passed
a
walled
garden
or
two
rode
along
the
bank
of
the
abi
khonsar
or
abi
k√ªm
which
we
had
followed
down
from
givr
admired
the
gleaming
domes
and
tiled
minarets
of
the
religious
buildings
on
its
bank
and
the
brick
bridge
which
spans
it
and
reached
a
sort
of
hotel
outside
the
gates
a
superior
caravanserai
with
good
though
terribly
draughty
upstairs
furnished
with
beds
chairs
and
tables
suited
for
the
upper
class
of
pilgrims
who
resort
to
this
famous
shrine
to
have
arrived
here
in
good
health
and
well
able
for
the
remaining
journey
of
nearly
a
hundred
miles
is
nothing
else
than
a
triumph
of
race
of
good
feeding
through
successive
generations
of
nurtured
on
damp
east
winds
there
is
an
air
of
civilisation
about
this
place
the
rooms
have
windows
with
glass
panes
and
doors
which
shut
a
fountain
in
front
beyond
that
a
garden
and
then
the
river
and
the
golden
shrine
of
fatima
and
its
exquisite
minarets
my
door
opens
on
a
roof
with
a
fine
view
of
the
city
and
hills
an
excellent
place
for
taking
exercise
so
strong
is
mohammedan
fanaticism
here
that
much
as
i
should
like
to
see
the
city
it
would
be
a
very
great
risk
to
walk
through
it
except
in
disguise
m
borrowed
a
from
the
telegraph
clerk
and
sent
it
back
with
two
horses
to
taj
khatan
for
the
orderly
who
was
left
there
very
ill
yesterday
morning
under
abbas
khan
charge
the
khan
feeling
so
ill
that
he
lay
down
inside
it
instead
of
riding
hadji
gave
up
work
altogether
so
i
unpacked
and
pitched
my
bed
glad
to
be
warmed
by
exercise
near
abbas
khan
burst
into
the
parlour
saying
that
the
horses
were
stuck
in
the
mud
he
evidently
desired
to
avoid
the
march
back
but
two
mules
have
been
sent
to
replace
the
horses
and
two
more
are
to
go
the
orderly
was
so
ill
that
i
expect
his
corpse
rather
than
himself
this
morning
hadji
looking
fearful
told
me
that
he
should
die
and
he
and
the
cook
are
now
in
bed
in
opposite
corners
of
a
room
below
with
a
good
fire
feverish
and
moaning
it
is
really
a
singular
disaster
and
shows
what
the
severity
of
the
journey
has
been
the
persian
doctor
with
a
european
medical
education
on
whom
our
hopes
were
built
when
asked
to
come
and
see
these
poor
men
readily
promised
to
do
so
but
the
princess
the
shah
daughter
whose
physician
he
is
absolutely
refuses
permission
on
the
ground
that
we
have
come
through
a
region
in
which
there
is
supposed
to
be
cholera
footnotes
this
custom
supposed
to
be
an
allusion
to
our
lord
and
his
mother
is
described
by
morier
in
his
journey
in
jairud
exports
fruit
to
k√ªm
and
even
to
tihran
and
in
the
autumn
i
was
interested
to
find
that
the
best
pears
and
peaches
in
the
hamadan
market
came
from
its
luxuriant
orchards
letter
vii
k√ªm
at
five
yesterday
afternoon
abbas
khan
rode
in
saying
that
the
with
the
orderly
much
better
was
only
three
miles
off
this
was
good
news
a
mattress
was
put
down
for
him
next
the
fire
and
all
preparations
for
his
comfort
were
made
snow
showers
had
been
falling
much
of
the
day
there
was
a
pitiless
east
wind
and
as
darkness
came
on
snow
fell
persistently
two
hours
passed
but
no
arrived
at
abbas
khan
was
ordered
to
go
in
search
of
it
with
a
good
lantern
came
without
any
news
at
the
man
whose
corpse
i
had
feared
to
see
came
in
much
exhausted
having
crawled
for
two
miles
through
the
mire
and
snow
the
who
pretended
to
start
with
the
lantern
never
went
farther
than
the
at
the
gate
where
he
had
spent
an
unconscientious
but
cheery
evening
in
the
pitch
darkness
the
and
mules
had
fallen
off
the
road
into
a
gap
the
was
smashed
and
a
good
white
mule
one
of
the
light
division
was
killed
her
back
being
broken
this
was
not
the
only
disaster
hadji
had
lain
down
on
the
borrowed
mattress
and
it
had
taken
fire
from
the
live
ashes
of
his
pipe
and
was
burned
and
he
was
a
little
scorched
the
telegraphist
was
to
have
started
for
isfahan
the
next
morning
with
his
wife
and
child
in
the
litter
in
order
to
vacate
the
house
for
the
new
official
and
his
family
and
their
baggage
had
actually
started
but
now
they
are
detained
till
this
can
be
repaired
in
the
meantime
another
official
has
arrived
with
his
goods
and
a
large
family
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
for
both
parties
but
they
bear
it
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
and
good
nature
last
night
i
made
hadji
drink
a
mug
of
hot
milk
with
two
tablespoonfuls
of
brandy
in
it
and
it
worked
wonders
this
morning
instead
of
a
nearly
blind
man
groping
his
way
about
with
difficulty
i
beheld
a
man
with
nothing
the
matter
but
a
small
speck
on
one
eye
it
must
have
been
he
looks
quite
spry
it
is
not
only
the
alcohol
which
has
cured
him
but
that
we
are
parting
by
mutual
consent
and
feeling
sorry
for
the
man
i
have
given
him
more
than
his
wages
and
his
full
demand
for
his
journey
back
to
bushire
with
additional
warm
clothing
m
has
also
given
him
a
handsome
present
i
fear
he
has
deceived
me
and
that
the
stone
deafness
feebleness
idiocy
and
the
shaking
palsied
gait
of
a
man
of
ninety
all
but
the
have
been
assumed
in
order
to
get
his
return
journey
paid
when
he
found
that
the
opportunities
for
making
money
were
not
what
he
expected
it
is
better
to
be
deceived
twenty
times
than
to
be
hard
on
these
poor
fellows
once
but
he
has
been
exasperating
and
i
feel
somewhat
aggrieved
at
having
worked
so
hard
to
help
a
man
who
was
malingering
the
last
seen
of
him
was
an
active
erect
man
walking
at
a
good
pace
by
the
side
of
his
mule
at
least
forty
years
thrown
off
he
did
not
then
leave
k√ªm
but
being
seized
with
pleurisy
was
treated
with
great
kindness
by
lyne
the
electrician
and
afterwards
by
the
the
prime
minister
who
was
visiting
k√ªm
and
who
thinking
to
oblige
me
brought
him
up
to
tihran
in
his
train
those
who
had
known
him
for
years
gave
a
very
bad
account
of
him
but
said
that
if
he
liked
he
could
be
a
good
servant
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
unfortunate
in
my
travelling
servant
the
english
telegraph
line
and
a
open
once
a
week
are
the
tokens
of
civilisation
in
k√ªm
a
telegraphic
invitation
from
the
british
minister
in
tihran
congratulatory
telegrams
on
our
safety
from
tihran
bushire
and
india
and
an
opportunity
for
posting
letters
make
one
feel
once
more
in
the
world
the
weather
is
grim
bitterly
cold
with
a
strong
wind
raw
and
damp
but
while
snow
is
whitening
the
hills
only
rain
and
sleet
fall
here
the
sun
has
not
shone
since
we
came
but
the
strong
cold
air
is
invigorating
like
our
own
climate
taking
advantage
of
it
being
friday
the
mohammedan
day
of
rest
when
most
of
the
shops
are
closed
and
the
bazars
are
deserted
we
rode
through
a
portion
of
them
preceded
by
the
wild
figure
of
abbas
khan
and
took
tea
at
the
telegraph
office
where
they
were
most
kind
and
pleasant
regarding
the
accident
which
had
put
them
to
so
much
inconvenience
k√ªm
is
on
the
beaten
track
and
has
a
made
road
to
tihran
almost
every
book
of
travels
in
persia
has
something
to
say
upon
it
but
except
that
it
is
the
second
city
in
persia
in
point
of
sanctity
and
that
it
thrives
as
much
by
the
bodies
of
the
dead
which
are
brought
in
thousands
for
burial
as
by
the
tens
of
thousands
of
pilgrims
who
annually
visit
the
shrine
of
fatima
and
that
it
is
renowned
for
fanaticism
there
is
not
much
to
say
about
it
situated
in
a
great
plain
the
gleam
of
its
golden
dome
and
its
slender
minarets
is
seen
from
afar
and
the
deep
green
of
its
orchards
and
the
bright
green
of
the
irrigated
and
cultivated
lands
which
surround
it
are
a
splash
of
welcome
fertility
on
the
great
brown
waste
singular
toothy
peaks
of
striated
marl
of
brilliant
colouring
red
blue
green
orange
and
salt
peaks
very
white
give
a
curious
brilliancy
to
its
environment
but
this
salt
which
might
be
a
source
of
wealth
to
the
city
is
not
worked
only
an
or
two

a
time

brought
in
to
supply
the
necessities
of
the

the
shrine
of
fatima
the
shrine
of
fatima
the
sister
of
reza
the
eighth
imam
who
sleeps
at
meshed
is
better
to
k√ªm
than
salt
mines
or
aught
else
moslems
though
they
regard
women
with
unspeakable
contempt
agree
to
reverence
fatima
as
a
very
holy
and
almost
worshipful
person
and
her
dust
renders
k√ªm
a
holy
place
attracting
tens
of
thousands
of
pilgrims
every
year
although
unlike
pilgrimages
to
meshed
and
kerbela
k√ªm
confers
no
lifelong
designation
on
those
by
whom
it
exists
its
estimated
population
is
souls
and
at
times
this
number
is
nearly
doubled
pilgrimage
consists
in
a
visit
to
the
tomb
of
fatima
paying
a
fee
and
in
some
cases
adding
a
votive
offering
vows
of
abstinence
from
some
special
sin
are
frequently
made
at
the
shrine
and
are
carefully
registered
the
dead
however
who
are
annually
brought
in
thousands
to
be
buried
in
the
sacred
soil
which
surrounds
the
shrine
are
the
great
source
of
the
wealth
of
k√ªm
these
corpses
travel
as
to
kerbela
on
mules
four
being
lashed
on
one
animal
occasionally
some
fresh
some
decomposing
others
only
bags
of
exhumed
bones
the
graves

the
kings
of
the
kajar
dynasty
members
of
royal
families
and
saints
are
actually
buried
within
the
precincts
of
the
shrine
the
price
of
interments
varies
with
the
proximity
to
the
dust
of
fatima
from
six
to
one
hundred
the
population
may
be
said
to
be
a
population

a
gruesome
city
a

its
golden

minarets
brighten
the
place

the
dome
of

is
covered
with
sheets
of
copper
plated
with
gold
an
eighth
of
an
inch
in
thickness
and
the
ornament
at
the
top
of
the
dome
which
is
of
pure
gold
is
said
to
weigh
lbs
the
slender
minarets
which
front
this
are
covered
with
a
mosaic
of
tiles
of
exquisite
tints
in
which
an
azure
blue
a
canary
yellow
and
an
iridescent
green
predominate
and
over
all
there
is
a
sheen
of
a
golden
hue
the
shrine
is
inaccessible
to
christians
i
asked
a
persian
doctor
if
i
might
look
in
for
one
moment
at
the
threshold
of
the
outer
court
and
he
replied
in
french
are
you
then
weary
of
life
my
indian
servant
an
educated
man
on
whose
faithful
though
meagre
descriptions
i
can
rely
visited
the
shrine
and
describes
the
dome
as
enriched
with
arabesques
in
mosaic
and
as
hung
with
consisting
chiefly
of
strips
of
silk
and
cotton
the
tomb
itself
he
says
is
covered
with
a
wooden
ark
with
certain
sacred
sentences
cut
upon
it
and
this
is
covered
by
a
large
brown
shawl
round
this
ark
which
is
under
the
dome
kerman
kashmir
and
indian
shawls
are
laid
down
as
carpets
this
open
space
is
surrounded
with
steel
railings
inlaid
with
gold
after
the
fashion
of
the
work
of
japan
and
the
whole
is
enclosed
with
a
solid
silver
fence
the
rails
of
which
are
as
thick
as
two
thumbs
and
as
high
as
a
tall
man
head
this
itself
is
regarded
as
of
great
antiquity
two
persian
kings
who
reigned
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
are
buried
near
the
beautiful
minarets
which
are
supposed
to
be
of
the
same
date
there
are
many
mosques
and
minarets
in
k√ªm
besides
a
quantity
of
conical
the
cones
of
which
have
formerly
been
covered
with
glazed
blue
tiles
of
a
turquoise
tint
some
of
which
still
remain
it
was
taken
by
the
afghans
in
and
though
partially
rebuilt
is
very
ruinous
it
has
a
mud
wall
disintegrating
from
neglect
surrounded
occasionally
by
a
ditch
and
at
other
times
by
foul
and
stagnant
ponds
the
ruinousness
of
k√ªm
can
scarcely
be
exaggerated
the
bazars
are
large
and
very
busy
and
are
considerably
more
picturesque
than
those
of
kirmanshah
the
town
lives
by
pilgrims
and
corpses
and
the
wares
displayed
to
attract
the
former
are
more
attractive
than
usual
there
are
nearly
shops
of
which
sell
manchester
goods
almost
exclusively
coarse
china
and
pottery
often
of
graceful
shapes
with
a
glaze
and
are
among
the
industries
of
this
city
which
also
makes
shoes
and
tans
leather
with
pomegranate
bark
the
is
now
full
and
rapid
but
is
a
mere
thread
in
summer
the
bridge
with
its
infamously
paved
roadway
eighteen
feet
wide
is
an
interesting
object
from
all
points
of
view
for
while
its
central
arch
has
a
span
of
feet
the
others
have
only
spans
of
twenty
the
gateway
beyond
the
bridge
is
tawdrily
ornamented
with
blue
and
green
glazed
tiles
after
seeing
several
of
the
cities
of
persia
i
am
quite
inclined
to
give
k√ªm
the
palm
for

seen
from
any
distant
point
of
view
that
it
is
a
holy
city
and
that
a
pilgrimage
to
its
shrine
is
supposed
to
atone
for
sin
are
its
great
interests
its
population
is
composed
in
large
proportion
of
and
or
descendants
of
mohammed
and
as
a
whole
is
devoted
to
the
reigning
shiah
creed
it
has
a
theological
college
of
much
repute
established
by
fath
ali
shah
which
now
has
students
the
women
are
said
to
be
very
devout
and
crowd
the
mosques
on
friday
evenings
when
their
devotions
are
led
by
an
the
men
are
fanatically
religious
though
the
fanaticism
is
somewhat
modified
no
wine
may
be
sold
in
k√ªm
and
no
jew
or
armenian
is
allowed
to
keep

k√ªm
being
a

city
manufactures
a
certain
amount
of
public
opinion
in
its
business
circles
which
differs
not
very
considerably
from
that
which
prevails
at
kirmanshah
the
traders
accept
it
as
a
foregone
conclusion
that
russia
will
occupy
persia
as
far
as
isfahan
on
the
death
of
the
present
shah
and
regard
such
a
destiny
as
fate
if
only
their

matters
little
they
say
whether
they
pay
their
taxes
to
the
shah
or
the
czar
to
judge
from
their
speech
islam
is
everything
to
them
and
their
country
very
little
and
the
strong
bond
of
the
faith
which
rules
life
and
thought
from
the
pillars
of
hercules
to
the
chinese
frontier
far
outweighs
the
paltry
considerations
of
patriotism
but
my
impression
is
that
all
orientals
prefer
the
tyrannies
and
exactions
and
the
swiftness
of
injustice
or
justice
of
men
of
their
own
creed
and
race
to
good
government
on
the
part
of
unintelligible
aliens
and
that
though
persians
seem
pretty
comfortable
in
the
prospect
of
a
double
occupation
of
persia
its
actual
accomplishment
might
strike
out
a
flash
of
patriotism
probably
this
ruinous
country
with
little
water
and
less
fuel
and
only
two
roads
which
deserve
the
name
has
possibilities
of
resurrection
under
greatly
changed
circumstances
of
the
two
occupations
which
are
regarded
as
certain
i
think
that
most
men
at
least
in
central
and
southern
persia
would
prefer
an
english
occupation
but
every
one
says
england
talks
and
does
not
act
and
that
russia
will
pour
troops
into
persia
while
england
is
talking
in
london
footnote
i
spent
two
days
at
k√ªm
five
weeks
later
and
saw
the
whole
of
it
in
disguise
and
in
order
to
attain
some
continuity
of
description
i
put
my
two
letters
together
letter
viii
caravanserai
of
aliabad
twelve
hours
and
a
half
of
hard
riding
have
brought
us
here
in
two
days
no
doctor
could
be
obtained
in
k√ªm
and
it
was
necessary
to
bring
the
sick
men
on
as
quickly
as
possible
for
medical
treatment
it
was
bitterly
cold
on
the
last
day
though
the
altitude
is
only
feet
and
it
was
a
tiresome
day
for
i
had
not
only
to
look
over
and
repack
but
to
clean
the
cooking
utensils
and
other
things
which
had
not
been
touched
apparently
since
we
left
baghdad
this
is
a
tedious
part
of
the
journey
a
beaten
track
with
few
features
of
interest
the
great
highway
from
isfahan
to
tihran
a
road
of
dreary
width
where
it
is
a
made
road
running
usually
perfectly
straight
with
a
bank
and
a
ditch
on
each
side
the
thaw
is
now
complete
and
travelling
consists
of
an
attempt
to
get
on
by
the
road
till
it
becomes
an
abyss
which
threatens
to
prove
bottomless
then
there
is
a
plunge
and
a
struggle
to
the
top
of
the
bank
or
over
the
bank
to
the
trodden
waste
but
any
move
can
be
only
temporary
the
mire
regulates
the
march
the
snow
is
nothing
to
the
mud
frequently
carcasses
of
camels
mules
and
asses
which
have
lain
down
to
die
under
their
loads
were
passed
then
caravans
with
most
of
the
beasts
entangled
in
the
miry
clay
unable
to
rise
till
they
were
unloaded
by
men
up
to
their
knees
in
the
quagmire
and
worst
of
all
mules
loaded
with
the
dead
so
loosely
tied
up
in
planks
that
in
some
cases
when
the
mule
flounders
and
falls
the
miserable
relics
of
humanity
tumble
out
upon
the
swamp
and
these
scenes
of
falling
struggling
and
even
perishing
animals
are
repeated
continually
along
the
level
parts
of
this
scarcely
passable
highroad
our
loads
owing
to
bad
tackle
were
always
coming
off
the
mule
fell
badly
the
packs
came
off
another
and
half
an
hour
was
spent
in
catching
the
animal
then
i
was
thrown
from
my
horse
into
soft
mud
cultivation
ceases
a
short
distance
from
k√ªm
giving
place
to
a
brown
waste
with
patches
of
saline
efflorescence
upon
it
on
which
high
hills
covered
partially
with
snow
send
down
low
spurs
of
brown
mud
the
water
nearly
everywhere
is
brackish
and
only
just
drinkable
after
crossing
a
rapid
muddy
river
nearly
dry
in
summer
by
a
much
decayed
bridge
of
seven
or
eight
low
arches
we
reached
and
a
long
gradual
ascent
and
a
series
of
gallops
brought
us
to
the
large
caravanserai
of
shashgird
an
immense
place
with
imposing
pretensions
which
are
fully
realised
within
in
the
outer
court
camels
were
lying
in
rows
a
fine
tiled
archway
leads
to
an
immense
quadrangle
with
a
fine
stone
or
covered
receptacle
for
water
in
the
middle
all
round
the
quadrangle
are
arched
recesses
or
mangers
each
with
a
room
at
the
back
to
the
number
of
eighty
at
two
of
the
corners
there
are
enclosed
courtyards
with
fountains
several
superior
rooms
with
beds
much
to
be
avoided
chairs
mirrors
and
tables
fairly
clean
somewhat
dreary
luxury
but
fortunately
at
this
season
free
from
vermin
that
caravanserai
can
accommodate
men
in
rooms
and
mules
long
march
which
however
has
had
more
road
suitable
for
galloping
has
been
over
wild
weird
desolate
country
interesting
from
its
desolation
and
its
great
wastes
forming
part
of
the
kavir
or
great
salt
desert
of
persia
absolutely
solitary
with
scarcely
a
hamlet
miles
of
the
great
highway
of
persia
without
a
living
creature
no
house
no
bush
nothing
later
there
were
some
vultures
feasting
on
a
dead
camel
and
a
of
two
bodies
down
in
the
mud
some
miles
from
shashgird
far
from
the
road
there
is
a
large
salt
lake
over
which
some
stationary
mists
were
brooding
beyond
this
an
ascent
among
snow
clouds
along
some
trenched
land
where
a
few
vines
and
saplings
have
been
planted
leads
to
a
caravanserai
built
for
the
accommodation
of
state
officials
on
their
journeys
where
in
falling
snow
we
vindicated
our
origin
in
the
triumphant
west
by
taking
lunch
on
a
windy
verandah
outside
rather
than
in
the
forlorn
dampness
of
the
inside
and
brought
a
look
of
surprise
even
over
the
impassive
face
of
the
when
we
left
the
snow
was
falling
in
large
wet
flakes
and
the
snow
clouds
were
drifting
wildly
among
the
peaks
of
a
range
which
we
skirted
for
a
few
miles
and
then
crossed
at
a
considerable
height
among
wonderful
volcanic
formations
mounds
of
scori√¶
and
outcrops
of
volcanic
rock
hills
of
all
shapes
fantastically
tumbled
about
chiefly
black
looking
as
if
their
fires
had
only
just
died
out
streaked
and
splotched
with
brilliant
ash
orange
carmine
and
green
a
remarkable
volcanic
scene
backed
by
higher
hills
looking
ghastly
in
the
snow
after
passing
over
an
absolutely
solitary
region
of
plains
and
slopes
at
a
gallop
m
a
little
in
front
always
and
abbas
khan
the
wildest
figure
imaginable
always
half
a
length
behind
the
of
the
thundering
hoofs
mingling
with
the
screech
of
the
cutting
north
wind
which
coming
over
the
snowy
elburz
range
benumbed
every
joint
on
the
slope
of
a
black
volcanic
hill
we
came
upon
the
lofty
towers
and
gaudy
tiled
front
of
this
great
caravanserai
imposing
at
a
distance
in
the
solitude
and
snow
clouds
but
shabby
on
a
nearer
view
and
tending
to
disintegrate
from
the
presence
of
saltpetre
in
the
bricks
and
mortar
there
are
successions
of
terraces
and
tanks
of
water
with
ducks
and
geese
upon
them
and
buildings
round
the
topmost
terrace
intended
to
be
imposing
the
is
expecting
the
the
prime
minister
and
his
train
who
will
occupy
rather
a
fine
though
tawdry
suite
of
apartments
but
though
they
were
at
our
service
i
prefer
the
comparative
cosiness
of
a
small
dark
damp
room
though
with
a
very
smoky
chimney
as
i
find
to
my
cost
legation
tihran
the
night
was
very
cold
and
the
reveille
specially
unwelcome
in
the
morning
the
people
were
more
than
usually
vague
about
the
length
of
the
march
some
giving
the
distance
at
miles
and
others
making
it
as
high
as
as
we
did
a
good
deal
of
galloping
and
yet
took
more
than
seven
hours
i
suppose
it
may
be
about
fortunately
we
could
desert
the
caravan
as
the
caravanserais
are
furnished
and
supply
tea
and
bread
the
baggage
mules
took
ten
hours
for
the
march
the
day
was
dry
and
sunny
and
the
scenery
if
such
a
tract
of
hideousness
can
be
called
scenery
was
at
its
best
its
one
charm
lies
in
the
solitude
and
freedom
of
a
vast
unpeopled
waste
the
made
road
degenerates
for
the
most
part
into
a
track
made
truly
but
rather
by
the
passage
of
thousands
of
animals
during
a
long
course
of
ages
than
by
men
hands
this
track
winds
among
low
ranges
of
sand
and
mud
hills
through
the
pass
of
the
angel
of
death
crosses
salt
and
muddy
streams
gravelly
stretches
and
quagmires
of
mud
and
tenacious
clay
passing
through
a
country
on
the
whole
inconceivably
hideous
unfinished
frothy
and
saturated
with
salt
the
great
brown
desert
which
extends
from
tihran
to
quetta
in
beloochistan
a
distance
of
miles
on
a
sunny
slope
we
met
the
prime
minister
with
a
considerable
train
of
horsemen
he
stopped
and
spoke
with
extreme
courtesy
through
an
interpreter
for
unlike
most
persians
of
the
higher
class
he
does
not
speak
french
he
said
we
had
been
for
some
time
expected
at
tihran
and
that
great
fears
were
entertained
for
our
safety
which
we
had
heard
at
k√ªm
he
is
a
man
with
a
rather
european
expression
not
more
than
or
and
in
spite
of
intrigues
and
detractors
has
managed
to
keep
his
hazardous
position
for
some
years
his
mother
was
lately
buried
at
k√ªm
and
he
was
going
thither
on
pilgrimage
after
the
usual
compliments
he
bowed
his
farewells
and
the
gay
procession
with
its
brilliant
trappings
and
prancing
horses
flashed
by
the
social
standing
of
a
persian
is
evidenced
by
the
size
of
his
retinue
and
the
first
of
the
subjects
must
have
been
attended
by
fully
forty
men
besides
a
number
of
servants
who
were
riding
with
his
baggage
animals
shortly
after
passing
him
a
turn
among
the
hills
brought
the
revelation
through
snow
clouds
of
the
magnificent
chain
of
the
elburz
mountains
with
the
huge
cone
of
demavend
their
monarch
feet
in
height
towering
high
above
them
gleaming
sunlit
above
the
lower
swampy
a
fordable
river
crossed
by
a
broad
bridge
of
five
arches
more
low
hills
more
rolling
desert
then
a
plain
of
mud
irrigated
for
cultivation
difficult
ground
for
the
horses
the
ruins
of
a
deserted
village
important
enough
to
have
possessed
two
and
then
we
reached
the
husseinabad
which
has
very
good
with
mirrors
on
the
walls
this
caravanserai
is
only
one
march
from
tihran
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
difficulties
were
over
abbas
khan
and
the
sick
orderly
were
sent
on
early
with
a
baggage
mule
loaded
with
evening
dress
and
other
necessities
of
civilisation
the
caravan
was
to
follow
at
leisure
and
m
and
i
started
at
ten
without
attendants
expecting
to
reach
tihran
early
in
the
afternoon
it
is
six
days
since
that
terrible
ride
of
ten
hours
and
a
half
and
my
bones
ache
as
i
recall
it
i
never
wish
to
mount
a
horse
again
it
had
been
a
very
cold
night
and
for
some
time
after
we
started
it
was
doubtful
whether
snow
or
rain
would
gain
the
day
but
after
an
hour
of
wet
snow
it
decided
on
rain
and
there
was
a
steady
downpour
all
day
the
elburz
range
which
the
day
before
had
looked
so
magnificent
when
fifty
miles
off
was
blotted
out
this
was
a
great
disappointment
an
ascent
of
low
blackish
volcanic
hills
is
made
by
a
broad
road
of
gray
gravel
which
a
torrent
has
at
some
time
frequented
thorns
and
thistles
grow
there
and
skeletons
of
animals
abound
everything
is
grim
and
gray
from
these
hills
we
descended
into
the
kavir
a
rolling
expanse
of
friable
soil
stoneless
strongly
impregnated
with
salt
but
only
needing
sufficient
water
to
wash
the
salt
out
of
it
and
to
irrigate
it
to
become
as
prolific
as
it
is
now
barren
it
is
now
a
sea
of
mud
crossed
by
a
broad
road
indicated
by
dykes
that
mud
growing
deeper
as
the
day
wore
on
hour
after
hour
we
plunged
through
it
sometimes
trying
the
road
and
on
finding
it
impassable
scrambling
through
the
ditches
and
over
the
dykes
to
the
plain
which
after
offering
firmer
foothold
for
a
time
became
such
a
slough
of
despond
that
we
had
to
scramble
back
to
the
road
and
so
on
hour
after
hour
meeting
nothing
but
one
ghastly
caravan
of
corpses
and
wretched
asses
falling
in
the
mud
at
scrambling
up
a
gravel
hill
with
a
little
wormwood
upon
it
and
turning
my
back
to
the
heavy
rain
i
ate
a
lunch
of
dates
and
ginger
insufficient
sustenance
for
such
fatigue
on
again
the
rain
pouring
the
mud
deepening
my
spine
in
severe
pain
we
turned
off
to
a
caravanserai
mostly
a
heap
of
ruins
the
roofs
having
given
way
under
the
weight
of
the
snow
and
there
i
sought
some
relief
from
pain
by
lying
down
for
the
short
thirty
minutes
which
could
be
spared
in
the
damp
room
it
was
then
growing
late
in
the
afternoon
all
landmarks
had
disappeared
in
a
brooding
mist
there
were
no
habitations
and
no
human
beings
of
whom
to
ask
the
way
the
pain
returned
severely
as
soon
as
i
mounted
and
increased
till
it
became
hardly
bearable
ceaseless
mud
ceaseless
heavy
rain
a
plain
of
mud
no
refuge
from
mud
and
water
attempts
to
gallop
were
made
with
the
risk
of
the
horses
falling
into
holes
and
even
m
rode
in
front
not
a
word
was
spoken
a
gleaming
dome
with
minarets
and
wood
appeared
below
the
shimran
hills
unluckily
where
two
roads
met
one
looked
impassable
and
we
took
the
other
which
though
it
eventually
took
us
to
tihran
was
a
of
some
miles
in
the
evening
when
i
was
hoping
that
tihran
was
at
hand
we
reached
the
town
of
shah
abdul
azim
built
among
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
either
rhages
or
rhei
the
gilded
dome
is
the
shrine
of
abdul
azim
and
is
a
great
place
of
pilgrimage
of
the
picnic
order
from
tihran
the
one
railroad
of
persia
runs
from
the
capital
to
this
town
as
we
floundered
in
darkness
along
wide
roads
planted
with
trees
there
was
the
incongruity
of
a
railway
whistle
and
with
deep
breathing
and
much
glare
an
engine
with
some
carriages
passed
near
the
road
taking
away
with
its
harsh
western
noises
that
glorious
freedom
of
the
desert
which
outweighs
all
the
hardship
even
of
a
winter
journey
it
was
several
miles
from
thence
to
the
gate
of
tihran
it
was
nearly
pitch
dark
when
we
got
out
of
abdul
azim
and
the
rain
still
fell
heavily
in
that
thick
rainy
darkness
no
houses
were
visible
even
if
they
exist
there
were
no
passengers
on
foot
or
on
horseback
it
was
a
darkness
which
might
be
felt
there
was
a
causeway
which
gave
foothold
below
the
mud
but
it
was
full
of
holes
and
broken
culverts
deep
in
slime
and
seemed
to
have
water
on
each
side
not
particular
in
keeping
within
bounds
it
was
necessary
to
get
on
lest
the
city
gates
should
be
shut
and
by
lifting
and
spurring
the
jaded
horses
they
were
induced
to
trot
and
canter
along
that
road
of
pitfalls
i
have
had
many
a
severe
ride
in
travelling
but
never
anything
equal
to
that
last
two
hours
the
severe
pain
and
want
of
food
made
me
so
faint
that
i
was
obliged
to
hold
on
to
the
saddle
i
kept
my
tired
horse
up
but
each
flounder
i
thought
would
be
his
last
there
was
no
guidance
but
an
occasional
flash
from
the
hoofs
of
the
horse
in
front
and
the
word
spur
ringing
through
the
darkness
after
an
hour
of
riding
in
this
desperate
fashion
we
got
into
water
and
among
such
dangerous
holes
that
from
that
point
we
were
obliged
to
walk
our
horses
who
though
they
were
half
dead
still
feebly
responded
to
bit
and
spur
we
reached
the
city
gate
just
as
half
of
it
was
shut
and
found
abbas
khan
waiting
there
the
caravan
with
the
other
sick
men
never
reached
tihran
till
late
the
next
morning
at
the
gate
we
learned
that
it
was
two
miles
farther
to
the
british
legation
and
that
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
get
there
but
on
horseback
one
lives
through
a
good
deal
but
i
all
but
succumbed
to
the
pain
and
faintness
inside
the
gate
there
was
an
open
sea
of
liquid
mud
across
which
for
a
time
certain
lights
shed
their
broken
reflections
there
was
a
railway
shriek
and
then
the
appearance
of
a
station
with
shunting
operations
vaguely
seen
in
a
vague
glare
then
a
tramway
track
buried
under
several
inches
of
slush
came
down
a
slope
and
crowded
tramway
cars
with
great
single
lamps
came
down
the
narrow
road
on
horses
too
tired
to
be
frightened
and
almost
too
tired
to
get
out
of
the
way
then
came
a
street
of
mean
houses
and
meaner
shops
lighted
with
kerosene
lamps
a
region
like
the
slums
of
a
new
american
city
with
and
saloons
barbers
shops
and
european
enormities
such
as
gazogenes
and
effervescing
waters
in
several
windows
later
there
were
frequent
foot
passengers
preceded
by
servants
carrying
huge
waxed
cambric
lanterns
of
a
chinese
shape
then
a
square
with
barracks
and
artillery
a
causewayed
road
dimly
lit
then
darkness
and
heavier
rain
and
worse
mud
through
which
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
carriage
and
pair
incongruously
flashed
by
that
time
even
the
courage
and
stamina
of
an
arab
horse
could
hardly
keep
mine
on
his
legs
and
with
a
swimming
head
and
dazed
brain
i
could
hardly
guide
him
as
i
had
done
from
the
gate
chiefly
by
the
wan
gleam
of
abbas
khan
pale
horse
and
expecting
to
fall
off
every
minute
i
responded
more
and
more
feebly
and
dubiously
to
the
question
frequently
repeated
out
of
the
darkness
are
you
surviving
just
as
endurance
was
on
the
point
of
giving
way
we
turned
from
the
road
through
a
large
gateway
into
the
extensive
grounds
which
surround
the
british
legation
a
large
building
forming
three
sides
of
a
quadrangle
with
a
fine
stone
staircase
leading
up
to
the
central
door
every
window
was
lighted
light
streamed
from
the
open
door
splashed
carriages
were
dashing
up
and
setting
down
people
in
evening
dress
there
were
crowds
of
servants
about
and
it
flashed
on
my
dazed
senses
that
it
must
be
after
eight
and
that
there
was
a
dinner
party
arriving
from
the
mud
of
the
kavir
and
the
slush
of
the
streets
after
riding
ten
hours
in
ceaseless
rain
on
a
horse
caked
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
dripping
exhausted
nearly
blind
from
fatigue
fresh
from
mud
hovels
and
the
congenial
barbarism
of
the
desert
and
with
the
rags
and
of
a
winter
journey
of
days
upon
me
light
and
festivity
were
overwhelming
alighting
at
a
side
door
scarcely
able
to
stand
i
sat
down
in
a
long
corridor
and
heard
from
an
english
steward
that
dinner
is
waiting
his
voice
sounded
very
far
off
and
the
once
familiar
announcement
came
like
a
memory
out
of
the
remote
past
presently
a
gentleman
appeared
in
evening
dress
wearing
a
star
which
conveyed
to
my
senses
that
it
was
sir
drummond
wolff
it
was
true
that
there
was
a
large
dinner
party
and
among
the
guests
the
minister
with
thoughtful
kindness
had
invited
all
to
whom
i
had
letters
of
introduction
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
make
any
effort
and
i
was
taken
up
to
a
room
in
which
the
comforts
of
english
civilisation
at
first
made
no
impression
upon
me
and
removing
only
the
mackintosh
cloak
weighted
with
mud
which
had
served
me
so
well
i
lay
down
on
the
hearthrug
before
a
great
coal
fire
till
four
the
next
morning
and
so
the
tale
ended
and
the
winter
journey
with
its
tremendous
hardships
and
unbounded
mercies
was
safely
accomplished
footnotes
the
altitude
of
demavend
is
variously
stated
i
remained
for
three
weeks
as
sir
drummond
wolff
guest
at
the
british
legation
receiving
from
him
that
courtesy
and
considerate
kindness
which
all
who
have
been
under
his
roof
delight
to
recall
i
saw
much
of
what
is
worth
seeing
in
tihran
including
the
shah
and
several
of
the
persian
statesmen
and
left
the
legation
with
every
help
that
could
be
given
for
a
long
and
difficult
journey
into
the
mountains
of
luristan
notes
on
tihran
it
is
a
matter
of
individual
taste
but
few
cities
in
the
east
interest
me
in
which
national
characteristics
in
architecture
costume
customs
and
ways
generally
are
either
being
obliterated
or
are
undergoing
a
partial
remodelling
on
western
lines
an
eastern
city
pure
and
simple
such
as
canton
niigata
or
baghdad
even
with
certain
drawbacks
forms
a
harmonious
whole
gratifying
to
the
eye
and
to
a
certain
sense
of
fitness
while
cairo
tokio
lahore
and
i
will
now
add
tihran
produce
the
effect
of
a
series
of
concussions
tihran
set
down
on
a
plain
a
scorched
desert
the
sublimity
of
which
is
interfered
with
by
or
underground
watercourses
with
their
gravel
mounds
and
ruinous
shafts
has
few
elements
of
beauty
or
grandeur
in
its
situation
even
though
the
triumphant
barbarism
of
the
desert
sweeps
up
to
its
gates
and
the
scored
and
channelled
shimran
range
backed
by
the
magnificent
peak
or
rather
cone
of
demavend
runs
to
the
of
the
city
within
only
ten
miles
of
its
walls
the
winter
with
its
snow
and
slush
disappeared
abruptly
two
days
after
i
reached
tihran
and
as
abruptly
came
the
spring
a
too
transient
enjoyment
and
in
a
few
days
to
brownness
and
barrenness
succeeded
a
tender
mist
of
green
over
the
trees
in
the
watered
gardens
rapidly
thickening
into
dark
leafage
in
which
the
sang
and
nature
helped
by
art
spread
a
carpet
of
violets
and
irises
over
the
brown
earth
but
all
of
verdure
and
greenery
that
there
is
lies
within
the
city
walls
outside
is
the
unconquerable
desert
rolling
in
endless
shades
of
buff
and
brown
up
to
the
elburz
range
and
elsewhere
to
the
far
horizon
situated
in
the
most
depressed
part
of
an
uninteresting
waste
in
lat
and
long
and
at
an
altitude
of
feet
the
climate
is
one
of
extremes
the
summer
extreme
being
the
most
severe
for
some
weeks
the
heat
is
nearly
insupportable
and
the
legations
and
all
of
the
four
hundred
europeans
who
are
not
bound
to
the
city
by
a
fate
which
they
execrate
betake
themselves
to
yailaks
or
summer
quarters
on
the
slopes
of
the
adjacent
mountains
entering
tihran
in
the
darkness
it
was
not
till
i
saw
it
coming
back
from
gulahek
the
yailak
of
the
british
legation
when
the
mud
was
drying
up
and
the
willows
were
in
their
first
young
green
that
i
formed
any
definite
idea
of
its
aspect
which
is
undeniably
mean
and
presents
no
evidences
of
antiquity
indeed
it
has
no
right
to
present
any
for
as
a
capital
it
only
came
into
existence
a
century
ago
with
the
first
king
of
the
present
kajar
dynasty
the
walls
are
said
to
be
eleven
miles
in
circuit
and
give
the
impression
of
being
much
too
large
so
many
are
the
vacant
spaces
within
them
they
consist
chiefly
of
a
broad
ditch
and
a
high
sloping
rampart
without
guns
twelve
domed
gateways
give
access
to
the
city
these
are
decorated
with
glazed
tiles
of
bright
colours
and
somewhat
gaudy
patterns
and
designs
representing
genii
lions
and
combats
of
mythical
heroes
above
the
wall
are
seen
some
minarets
the
domes
of
two
mosques
and
the
iron
ribs
of
a
roofless
theatre
in
the
shah
garden
in
which
under
a
temporary
awning
the
or
passion
play
elsewhere
referred
to
is
acted
once
a
year
in
presence
of
the
shah
and
several
thousand
spectators
entering
by
a
gateway
over
which
is
depicted
a
scene
in
the
life
of
rustem
the
achilles
of
persia
or
by
the
sheikh
abdul
azim
gate
where
the
is
established
and
through
which
all
caravans
of
goods
must
reach
tihran
the
magnitude
of
the
untidy
vacant
spaces
and
the
shabby
mud
hovels
which
fringe
them
create
an
unfavourable
impression
then
there
are
the
inevitable
ruinousness
the
alleys
with
broken
gutters
in
the
centre
the
pools
of
slime
or
the
heaps
of
dust
according
to
the
weather
and
the
general
shabbiness
of
blank
walls
of
bricks
which
give
one
the
impression
i
believe
an
unjust
one
of
decay
and
retrogression
i
never
went
through
those
mean
outskirts
of
tihran
which
are
within
the
city
walls
without
being
reminded
of
a
man
in
shabby
clothes
preposterously
too
big
for
him
the
population
is
variously
estimated
at
from
to
souls
it
varies
considerably
with
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
court
the
streets
and
bazars
are
usually
well
filled
with
people
and
i
did
not
see
many
beggars
or
evidences
of
extreme
poverty
even
in
the
jewish
quarter
on
the
whole
it
impressed
me
as
a
bustling
place
but
the
bustle
is
not
picturesque
it
is
framed
in
mean
surroundings
and
there
is
little
variety
in
costume
and
much
sober
if
not
sad
colouring
in
old
tihran
the
alleys
are
crooked
dirty
and
narrow
and
the
bazars
chiefly
frequented
by
the
poor
are
very
mean
and
untidy
but
the
better
bazars
whether
built
as
some
are
round
small
domed
open
spaces
or
in
alleys
roofed
with
low
brick
domes
are
decidedly
handsome
and
are
light
wide
clean
and
in
every
way
adapted
for
the
purposes
of
buying
and
selling
european
women
even
though
unattended
can
walk
through
them
quite
freely
without
being
mobbed
or
stared
at
the
best
bazars
are
piled
with
foreign
merchandise
to
the
exclusion
of
native
goods
which
if
they
are
of
the
better
quality
must
be
searched
for
in
corners
indeed
if
people
want
fine
carpets
rich
embroideries
inlaid
arms
and
kerman
stuffs
they
must
resort
to
the
itinerant
dealers
who
gauge
the
tastes
and
purchasing
powers
of
every
european
resident
and
visitor
and
who
may
be
seen
at
all
hours
gliding
in
a
sort
of
surreptitious
fashion
round
the
legation
compounds
conveying
their
beautiful
temptations
on
donkeys
backs
it
is
chiefly
in
the
fine
lofty
saddlery
bazar
and
some
small
bazars
that
native
manufactures
are
all
travelling
is
on
horseback
and
the
persian
though
sober
in
the
colours
of
his
costly
clothing
loves
crimson
and
gold
in
leather
and
cloth
embroidered
housings
and
headstalls
and
gorgeous
for
his
horse
the
usual
saddle
is
of
plain
wood
very
high
before
and
behind
and
without
stuffing
a
thick
soft
or
piece
of
felt
covers
the
horse
back
and
over
this
are
placed
two
or
more
covered
with
a
very
showy
and
often
highly
ornamental
cover
with
tasselled
ends
embroidered
in
gold
and
silks
and
occasionally
with
real
gems
the
saddle
itself
is
smoothly
covered
with
a
soft
ornamental
cover
made
to
fit
it
and
the
crupper
breastplate
and
headstall
are
frequently
of
crimson
leather
embroidered
in
gold
or
stitched
ingeniously
with
turquoise
beads
the
mule
whether
the
pacing
worth
from
to
much
affected
by
rich
persians
in
tihran
or
the
humbler
beast
of
burden
is
not
forgotten
by
the
traders
in
the
great
saddlery
bazar
rich
take
great
pride
in
the
outfit
of
their
mules
and
do
not
grudge
twenty
upon
it
hence
are
to
be
seen
elaborate
headstalls
breastplates
and
straps
for
bells
of
showy
embroidery
and
leather
stitched
completely
over
with
turquoise
beads
and
cowries
the
latter
a
favourite
adornment
while
cowried
headstalls
are
also
ornamented
with
rows
of
woollen
tassels
dyed
with
beautiful
vegetable
dyes
in
this
bazar
too
are
found
the
great
leather
or
carpet
without
which
it
is
inconvenient
to
travel
small
leather
portmanteaus
for
strapping
behind
the
saddles
of
those
who
travel
post
cylindrical
cases
over
two
feet
long
which
are
attached
in
front
of
the
saddle
decorated
holsters
the
multifarious
gear
required
for
the
travelling
the
deep
leather
belts
which
are
worn
by
riders
the
leathern
which
are
slung
on
the
saddles
the
courier
bags
and
a
number
of
other
articles
of
necessity
or
luxury
which
are
regarded
as
essential
by
the
persian
traveller
in
most
of
the
bazars
the
shops
are
packed
to
the
ceiling
with
foreign
goods
it
looks
as
if
there
were
cottons
and
woollen
cloth
for
the
clothing
of
all
persia
i
saw
scarcely
any
rough
woollen
goods
or
shoddy
the
persian
wears
superfine
smooth
costly
cloth
chiefly
black
and
fawn
stiff
in
texture
and
with
a
dull
shine
upon
it
the
best
comes
exclusively
from
austria
a
slightly
inferior
quality
from
germany
and
such
cloth
fabrics
as
are
worn
by
europeans
from
england
and
russia
the
european
cottons
which
are
slowly
but
surely
displacing
the
heavy
durable
native
goods
either
undyed
or
dyed
at
isfahan
with
madder
saffron
and
indigo
are
of
colours
and
patterns
suited
to
native
taste
white
and
canary
yellow
designs
on
a
red
ground
predominating
and
are
both
of
russian
and
english
make
and
the
rivalry
which
extends
from
the
indian
frontier
through
central
asia
is
at
in
the
cotton
bazars
of
tihran
it
does
not
appear
that
at
present
either
side
can
claim
the
advantage
in
a
search
for
writing
paper
thread
tapes
and
what
are
known
as
small
wares
i
never
saw
anything
that
was
not
russian
the
cheap
things
such
as
oil
lamps
coarse
coloured
prints
of
the
russian
imperial
family
in
tawdry
frames
lacquered
tin
boxes
fitted
glass
teacups
china
tawdry
lacquered
trays
glass
brooches
bead
necklaces
and
a
number
of
other
things
which
are
coming
into
use
at
least
in
the
and
the
western
portions
of
the
empire
are
almost
exclusively
russian
as
is
natural
for
the
low
price
at
which
they
are
sold
would
leave
no
margin
of
profit
on
such
imports
from
a
more
distant
country
a
stroll
through
the
tihran
bazars
shows
the
observer
something
of
the
extent
and
rapidity
with
which
europe
is
ruining
the
artistic
taste
of
asia
masses
of
rubbish
atrocious
in
colouring
and
hideous
in
form
the
principle
of
shoddy
carried
into
all
articles
along
with
the
quintessence
of
vulgarity
which
is
pretence
goods
of
nominal
utility
which
will
not
stand
a
week
wear
the
refuse
of
european
markets
in
art
philistinism
in
most
else
brummagem
without
a
quality
of
beauty
or
solidity
to
recommend
them
are
training
the
tastes
and
changing
the
habits
of
the
people
one
squarish
bazar
much
resorted
to
for
glass
and
hardware
and
what
the
americans
call
assorted
notions
is
crammed
with
austrian
glass
kerosene
lamps
of
all
sizes
in
hundreds
chandeliers
etc
the
amount
of
glass
exhibited
there
for
sale
is
extraordinary
and
not
less
remarkable
is
the
glut
of
cheap
hardware
and
worthless
it
is
the
lowther
arcade
put
down
in
tihran
kerosene
and
candles
may
be
called
a
russian
monopoly
and
russia
has
completely
driven
french
sugar
from
the
markets
in
the
foreign
town
as
it
may
be
called
there
are
two
or
three
french
shops
an
american
shop
for
notions
and
a
german
chemist
the
european
quarter
is
in
the
northern
part
of
tihran
and
is
close
to
vacant
and
airy
spaces
there
are
the
turkish
embassy
and
the
legations
of
england
france
germany
russia
italy
belgium
austria
and
america
and
a
dutch
each
with
its
persian
who
perform
escort
duty
their
large
and
shady
compounds
brightened
by
their
national
flags
and
the
stir
and
circumstance
which
surround
them
are
among
the
features
of
the
city
the
finest
of
all
the
legation
enclosures
is
that
of
england
which
is
beautifully
wooded
and
watered
the
and
hall
of
the
minister
residence
are
very
handsome
and
a
byzantine
clock
tower
gives
the
building
a
striking
air
of
distinction
the
grounds
contain
several
detached
houses
occupied
by
the
secretaries
and
others
a
very
distinct
part
of
the
foreign
quarter
is
that
occupied
by
the
large
and
handsome
buildings
of
the
american
presbyterian
mission
which
consist
of
a
church
occupied
at
stated
hours
by
a
congregation
of
the
reformed
armenian
church
and
in
which
in
the
afternoons
of
sundays
potter
the
senior
missionary
reads
the
english
liturgy
and
preaches
an
english
sermon
for
the
benefit
of
the
residents
very
fine
for
armenian
girls
and
boys
and
the
houses
of
the
missionaries
three
clerical
one
medical
and
several
ladies
one
of
whom
is
an
outside
this
fine
enclosure
is
a
medical
missionary
dispensary
and
last
year
in
a
good
situation
at
a
considerable
distance
a
very
fine
medical
missionary
hospital
was
completed
the
boys
and
schools
are
of
a
very
high
class
to
my
thinking
the
pupils
are
too
much
europeanised
in
dress
and
habits
but
i
understand
that
this
is
at
the
desire
of
the
armenian
parents
the
missionaries
are
not
allowed
to
receive
moslem
pupils
but
besides
armenians
they
educate
jewish
youths
some
of
whom
have
become
christians
and
a
few
guebres
or
zoroastrians
i
do
not
think
that
the
capital
is
a
hopeful
place
for
missionary
work
the
presence
of
europeans
of
various
creeds
and
nationalities
complicates
matters
and
the
fine
perhaps
too
fine
mission
buildings
in
proximity
to
the
houses
of
wealthy
foreigners
are
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
moslem
and
jewish
quarters
that
persons
who
might
desire
to
make
inquiries
concerning
the
christian
faith
must
be
deterred
both
by
the
space
to
be
traversed
and
the
conspicuousness
of
visiting
a
mission
compound
in
such
a
position
the
members
of
the
mission
church
last
year
were
altogether
armenians
the
education
and
training
given
in
the
schools
are
admirable
indications
of
the
changes
which
we
consider
improvements
abound
in
tihran
there
are
many
roads
accessible
to
wheeled
vehicles
there
are
hackney
carriages
a
tramway
carrying
thousands
of
passengers
weekly
has
been
laid
down
from
the
or
central
square
to
one
of
the
southern
gates
there
are
real
streets
paved
with
cobble
stones
and
bordered
with
definite
sidewalks
young
trees
and
shops
there
is
a
railroad
about
four
miles
long
from
the
city
to
the
village
of
sheikh
abdul
azim
there
are
and
fittings
though
the
light
is
somewhat
of
a
failure
there
is
an
organised
city
police
in
smart
black
uniforms
with
violet
facings
under
the
command
of
count
monteforte
an
italian
soldiers
in
europeanised
uniforms
abound
some
of
them
the
persian
cossacks
in
full
russian
uniforms
and
military
bands
instructed
by
a
french
bandmaster
play
european
airs
not
always
easily
recognisable
for
the
pleasure
of
the
polyglot
public
all
ordinary
business
can
be
transacted
at
the
imperial
bank
which
having
acquired
the
branches
and
business
of
the
new
oriental
bank
bids
fair
to
reign
supreme
in
the
commercial
world
of
persia
the
shah
who
has
hitherto
kept
his
hoards
under
his
own
eye
having
set
an
example
of
confidence
by
becoming
a
depositor
european
tailors
dressmakers
and
milliners
render
a
resort
to
europe
unnecessary
there
are
at
least
two
hotels
where
a
european
may
exist
about
five
hundred
european
carriages
many
of
them
russian
with
showy
russian
horses
harnessed
la
dash
about
the
streets
with
little
regard
to
pedestrians
though
an
accident
if
a
european
were
the
offender
might
lead
to
a
riot
the
carriages
of
the
many
legations
are
recognisable
by
their
outriders
but
even
the
european
quarter
and
its
newish
road
on
which
are
many
of
the
legations
some
of
the
foreign
shops
and
the
fine
compound
and
handsome
buildings
of
the
imperial
bank
has
a
persian
admixture
some
of
the
stately
houses
of
official
and
rich
persians
are
there
easily
recognisable
by
their
low
closed
gateways
and
general
air
of
seclusion
many
of
these
possess
exquisite
gardens
with
fountains
and
tanks
and
all
the
arrangements
for
the
life
which
persians
love
in
the
early
spring
afternoons
the
great
sight
of
the
road
outside
the
british
legation
is
the
crowd
of
equestrians
or
rather
of
the
horses
they
ride
however
much
the
style
of
street
furniture
tastes
art
and
costume
have
been
influenced
by
europe
fortunately
for
picturesque
effect
the
persian
even
in
the
capital
retains
the
persian
saddle
and
equipments
from
later
observation
i
am
inclined
to
think
very
highly
of
the
hardiness
and
stamina
of
the
persian
horse
though
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
tihran
i
doubted
both
such
showy
animals
broken
to
a
carriage
which
shows
them
to
the
best
advantage
though
not
at
the
expense
of
strength
with
flowing
wavy
manes
necks
clothed
with
thunder
dilated
nostrils
showing
the
carmine
interior
and
a
look
of
scorn
and
high
breeding
i
never
saw
elsewhere
the
tail
which
in
obedience
to
fashion
we
mutilate
and
abridge
is
allowed
in
persia
its
full
development
and
except
in
the
case
of
the
shah
white
horses
when
it
is
dyed
magenta
is
perfectly
beautiful
held
far
from
the
body
like
a
flag
the
arched
neck
haughty
bearing
and
easy
handling
which
easterns
love
are
given
by
very
sharp
bits
and
a
crowd
of
these
beautiful
animals
pawing
the
ground
prancing
caracoling
walking
with
a
gait
as
though
the
earth
were
too
vulgar
for
their
touch
or
flashing
past
at
a
gallop
all
groomed
to
perfection
and
superbly
caparisoned
ridden
by
men
who
know
how
to
ride
and
who
are
in
sympathy
with
their
animals
is
one
of
the
fascinations
of
tihran
creeping
along
by
the
is
often
seen
a
handsome
pacing
or
large
white
ass
nearly
always
led
carrying
a
persian
lady
attended
by
servants
a
shapeless
black
bundle
with
what
one
supposes
to
be
the
outline
of
a
hand
clutching
the
enshrouding
black
silk
sheet
tightly
over
her
latticed
white
mask
so
completely
enveloped
that
only
a
yellow
shoe
without
a
heel
and
a
glimpse
of
a
violet
trouser
can
be
seen
above
the
short
stirrups
another
piece
of
orientalism
unaffected
by
western
influence
is
the
music
performed
daily
at
sunset
in
the
upper
stories
of
some
of
the
tiled
gateways
which
lead
into
and
out
of
the
principal
squares
this
is
evoked
from
drums
fifes
cymbals
and
huge
horns
and
as
the
latter
overpower
all
the
former
the
effect
is
much
like
that
of
the
braying
of
the
colossal
silver
horns
from
the
roofs
of
the
tibetan
many
people
suppose
that
this
daily
homage
to
the
setting
sun
is
a
relic
of
the
ancient
fire
or
sun
worship
two
great
squares
one
of
them
with
a
tank
in
the
middle
with
a
big
gun
at
each
corner
artillery
barracks
on
three
sides
and
a
number
of
guns
on
the
fourth
are
among
the
features
of
tihran
in
this
great
there
are
always
soldiers
in
multifarious
uniforms
lounging
people
waiting
for
the
and
royal
footmen
whose
grotesque
costumes
border
on
the
ridiculous
they
are
indeed
a
fitting
accompaniment
to
the
royal
horses
with
their
magenta
tails
and
spots
for
they
wear
red
coats
with
skirts
and
green
facings
green
white
stockings
and
tall
stiff
erections
resembling
a
fool
cap
on
the
head
topped
by
crests
suggestive
of
nothing
but
a
cock
comb
a
gateway
much
ornamented
leads
from
the
artillery
square
or
by
a
short
road
shaded
with
trees
to
the
citadel
or
ark
which
is
an
immense
enclosure
rather
mangy
and
unprepossessing
in
its
exterior
which
contains
the
palace
of
the
shah
the
arsenal
certain
public
offices
the
royal
colleges
etc
over
the
gateway
floats
rather
grandly
the
royal
standard
bearing
the
lion
and
the
sun
in
yellow
on
a
green
ground
the
shah
palace
is
very
magnificent
and
the
shady
gardens
beautifully
kept
with
their
fountains
and
tanks
of
pale
blue
tiles
through
which
clear
water
constantly
moves
are
worthy
of
a
royal
residence
from
the
outside
above
the
high
wall
the
chief
feature
is
a
very
lofty
pavilion
brilliantly
and
elaborately
painted
with
walls
inclining
inwards
and
culminating
in
two
high
towers
this
striking
structure
contains
the
or
of
the
sovereign
and
his
private
apartments
this
hasty
sketch
exhausts
those
features
of
tihran
which
naturally
arrest
the
stranger
attention
there
is
no
splendour
about
it
externally
but
there
is
splendour
within
it
and
possibly
few
european
residences
can
exceed
in
taste
and
magnificence
the
palaces
of
the
minister
of
justice
the
the
the
and
a
few
others
though
i
regret
that
much
of
the
furniture
has
been
imported
from
europe
as
it
vexes
the
eye
more
or
less
with
its
incongruity
of
form
and
colouring
the
current
of
european
influence
which
is
affecting
externals
in
tihran
is
not
likely
now
to
be
stemmed
eastern
civilisation
is
doomed
and
the
transition
period
is
not
beautiful
whatever
the
outcome
may
be
so
much
for
what
is
within
the
walls
that
which
is
outside
deserves
a
passing
notice
as
the
environment
of
the
capital
the
sole
grandeur
of
the
situation
lies
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
shimran
mountains
a
huge
wall
white
or
brown
according
to
the
season
with
some
irrigated
planting
near
its
base
which
is
spotted
with
villages
and
the
not
only
of
the
numerous
legations
but
of
rich
europeans
and
persians
otherwise
the
tameless
barbarism
of
a
desert
which
man
has
slashed
tunnelled
delved
and
heaped
lies
outside
the
city
walls
deformed
by
the
long
lines
of
some
choked
others
still
serviceable
by
which
the
city
is
supplied
with
water
from
the
mountains
their
shafts
illustrating
the
scriptural
expression
ruinous
heaps
in
the
glare
of
the
summer
sun
with
the
mercury
ranging
from
to
in
the
shade
and
with
the
heated
atmosphere
quivering
over
the
burning
earth
these
wastes
are
abandoned
to
carcasses
and
the
vultures
which
fatten
on
them
and
travelling
is
done
at
night
when
a
breeze
from
the
shimran
range
sends
the
thermometer
down
from
to
curving
to
the
of
tihran
the
mountains
end
in
a
bare
ridge
around
the
base
of
which
according
to
many
arch√¶ologists
lie
vestiges
of
the
ancient
city
of
rhages
known
in
later
days
as
rhei
a
tomb
of
brick
with
angular
surfaces
sacred
to
the
memory
of
an
ancient
and
romantic
attachment
remains
of
fortifications
and
the
parsee
cemetery
on
a
ledge
overlooking
these
remains
break
the
monotony
of
the
waste
in
that
direction
this
cemetery
or
tower
of
silence
a
white
splash
on
the
brown
hillside
is
visible
from
afar
the
truncated
cones
which
in
many
places
mark
seats
of
the
ancient
zoroastrian
worship
have
been
mentioned
here
and
there
but
it
is
only
in
tihran
and
yezd
that
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
are
found
in
such
numbers
as
to
be
able
to
give
prominence
to
their
ancient
rites
of
sepulture
probably
throughout
persia
their
number
does
not
exceed
their
head
resides
in
tihran
they
bear
a
good
character
for
uprightness
and
except
in
yezd
where
they
weave
rich
stuffs
they
are
chiefly
agriculturists
they
worship
firelight
and
the
sun
on
the
principles
symbolised
by
both
they
never
use
tobacco
and
it
is
impolite
to
smoke
in
their
presence
because
of
the
sacredness
of
fire
their
belief
has
been
and
is
that
to
bury
the
dead
in
the
earth
is
to
pollute
it
and
one
among
the
reasons
of
the
persecution
of
the
early
christians
by
the
zoroastrians
was
their
abhorrence
of
the
desecration
of
the
ground
produced
by
the
modes
of
christian
burial
this
tower
of
silence
near
tihran
is
a
large
round
edifice
of
whitewashed
mud
and
stone
on
the
top
of
it
a
few
feet
below
the
circular
parapet
the
dead
are
laid
to
be
devoured
by
birds
and
consumed
by
exposure
to
the
elements
the
destiny
of
the
spirit
is
supposed
to
be
indicated
by
the
eye
which
is
first
devoured
by
the
fowls
of
the
air
the
right
eye
signifying
bliss
in
a
northern
direction
to
which
the
eye
always
turns
to
be
refreshed
by
the
purity

of

the
two
roads
and
the
many
tracks
which
centre
in

scoring
the

miles
around

a
feature
of
the
landscape
not
to
be
overlooked
the

the
most
important
except
the

these
are
some
of
the
features
of
the
environments
of
tihran
a
traveller
writing
ten
years
hence
may
probably
have
to
tell
that
the
city
has
extended
to
its
walls
that
western
influence
is
nearly
dominant
in
externals
and
possibly
that
the
who
for
years
have
been
hanging
about
the
palace
in
alternations
of
hope
and
despondency
have
made
something
of
their
concessions
and
that
goods
reach
the
capital
in
another
way
than
on
the
backs
of
animals
footnotes
a
volume
of
travels
in
persia
would
scarcely
be
complete
without
some
slight
notice
of
the
northern
capital
but
for
detailed
modern
accounts
of
it
the
reader
should
consult
various
other
books
especially
wills
and
benjamin
if
he
has
not
already
done
so
there
are
two
roads
properly
so
called
in
persia

in
the
summer
wheeled
carriages
with
some
assistance
can
get
from
place
to
place
over
several
of
the

i

mention

there
was
a
great
crowd
outside

where
we
were
received
by
many
men
in

the

beautifully
laid
out
in
a
more
formal
style
than
i
have
hitherto
seen

of

much
decorated

with
glazed

arranged

the
general
effect
is
striking

certainly
one

indeed

up
in

below
the
palace
if
such
a
blaze
of
splendour
exists
in
this
shrunken
shrivelled
depopulated
empire
what
must
have
been
the
magnificence
of
the
courts
of
darius
and
xerxes
into
which
were
brought
the
treasures
of
almost
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
since
seeing
this
i
think
that
many
of
the
early
descriptions
of
wealth
which
i
have
regarded
as
oriental
hyperbole
were
literal
and
that
there
was
a
time
in
persia
as
in
judea
when
silver
was
not
accounted
of
and
to
come
down
from
the
far
of
darius
xerxes
and
khosroe
and
the
parthian
kings
there
have
been
within
almost
modern
times
persian
sovereigns
celebrated
among
other
things
for
their
successful
looting
of
foreign
kingdoms
shah
abbas
the
great
and
nadir
shah
who
scarcely
two
hundred
years
ago
returned
from
the
sack
of
delhi
with
gems
valued
at
twenty
millions
of
our
money
after
we
had
seen
most
of
what
was
to
be
seen
the
vizier
left
us
and
we
went
to
the
room
in
which
stands
the
celebrated
peacock
throne
brought
by
nadir
shah
from
delhi
and
which
has
been
valued
at
this
throne
is
a
large
stage
with
parapets
and
a
high
fan
back
and
is
reached
by
several
steps
it
is
entirely
of
gold
enamel
and
the
back
is
incrusted
with
rubies
and
diamonds
its
priceless
carpet
has
a
broad
border
the
white
arabesque
pattern
of
which
is
formed
of
pearls
closely
stitched
you
will
think
that
i
am
lapsing
into
oriental
exaggeration
while
we
were
admiring
the
beautiful
view
of
the
gardens
from
the
windows
of
this
room
hassan
ali
khan
better
known
as
the
nawab
suggested
that
we
should
retire
as
the
shah
is
in
the
habit
of
visiting
and
enjoying
his
treasures
at
a
later
hour
however
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
on
the
threshold
of
the
vestibule
stood
the
shah
the
king
of
kings
the
asylum
of
the
universe
and
that
his
presence
there
was
not
an
accident
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
grand
vizier
was
with
him
sir
henry
advanced
attended
by
the
nawab
and
presented
me
lifting
his
hat
to
the
king
who
neither
then
nor
when
he
left
us
made
the
slightest
inclination
of
his
head
hassan
ali
khan
in
answer
to
a
question
mentioned
some
of
my
travels
and
said
that
with
his
majesty
permission
i
wished
to
visit
the
bakhtiari
country
the
king
pushed
up
his
big
horn
spectacles
and
focused
his
eyes
about
which
there
is
something
very
peculiar
upon
me
with
a
stare
which
would
have
been
disconcerting
to
a
younger
person
asked
if
i
were
going
to
travel
alone
in
his
dominions
and
if
fitting
arrangements
had
been
made
if
i
had
been
in
pekin
and
had
visited
borneo
and
the
celebes
said
a
few
other
things
and
then
without
a
bow
turned
round
abruptly
and
walked
down
the
garden
with
the
this
accidental
and
informal
presentation
was
a
very
pleasant
incident
the
shah
is
not
what
i
expected
from
his
various
portraits
his
manner
though
he
was
said
to
be
very
affable
on
this
occasion
has
neither
eastern
nor
western
polish
he
is
a
somewhat
man
well
on
in
middle
life
rather
dark
in
complexion
and
wearing
a
thick
dark
moustache
probably
dyed
as
is
the
custom
the
long
twisted
moustache
conceals
the
expression
of
his
mouth
and
the
spectacles
with
thick
horn
rims
that
of
his
eyes
he
was
very
simply
dressed
the
diamond
aigrette
and
sword
with
jewelled
hilt
with
which
pictures
and
descriptions
have
familiarised
us
were
absent
and
this
splendid
monarch
the
heir
of
splendour
and
the
possessor
of
fabulous
treasures
wore
the
ordinary
persian
high
cap
of
astrakan
lambskin
without
any
ornament
dark
trousers
with
a
line
of
gold
braid
a
coat
of
kerman
silk
brocade
loose
and
open
under
which
were
huddled
one
or
more
coats
a
composed
of
large
diamonds
completed
his
costume
he
did
not
wear
gloves
and
i
noticed
that
his
hands
though
carefully
attended
to
were
those
of
a
man
used
to
muscular
exercise
strong
and
wiry
as
the
sovereign
and
his
prime
minister
walked
away
it
was
impossible
not
to
speculate
upon
coming
events
what
will
happen
for
instance
when
possibly
the
ablest
man
in
the
country
which
he
rules
and
probably
the
best
and
most
patriotic
ruler
among
oriental
despots
goes
the
way
of
all
the
earth
and
again
whether
ali
askar
khan
who
has
held
his
post
for
five
years
and
who
at
is
the
foremost
man
in
persia
after
the
king
will
weather
the
storm
of
intrigue
which
rages
round
his
head
and
resist
the
undermining
influence
of
russia
i
have
had
two
interesting
conversations
with
him
and
he
was
good
enough
to
propose
success
to
my
journey
at
a
dinner
at
the
legation
and
though
as
he
does
not
speak
french
the
services
of
an
interpreter
were
necessary
he
impressed
me
very
favourably
as
a
man
of
thought
intelligence
and
patriotism
he
made
one
remark
which
had
a
certain
degree
of
pathos
in
it
after
speaking
of
the
severe
strictures
and
harsh
criticisms
of
certain
recent
writers
which
he
said
were
very
painful
to
persians
he
added
i
hope
if
you
write
you
will
write
kindly
and
not
crush
the
aspirations
of
my
struggling
country
as
some
have
done
this
the
faithful
or
trusted
one
of
the
sovereign
the
grand
vizier
or
prime
minister
the
second
person
in
the
empire
who
unites
in
his
person
at
this
time
the
ministries
of
the
treasury
the
interior
the
court
and
customs
is
of
humble
antecedents
being
the
son
of
a
man
who
was
originally
an
inferior
attendant
on
the
shah
in
his
hunting
expeditions
and
is
the
grandson
of
an
armenian
captive
certain
persons
of
importance
are
bent
upon
his
overthrow
and
it
can
only
be
by
the
continued
favour
and
confidence
of
the
shah
that
he
can
sustain
himself
against
their
intrigues
combined
with
those
of
russia
my
visit
to
the
palace
terminated
with
the
sight
of
another
opening
upon
the
garden
in
which
a
few
days
hence
with
surroundings
of
great
magnificence
the
shah
will
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
diplomatic
corps
and
afterwards
give
a
general
audience
to
the
people
this
is
an
annual
ceremony
at
the
festival
of
no
ruz
when
the
persian
new
year
begins
at
the
time
of
the
spring
solstice
and
is
probably
a
relic
of
the
zoroastrian
worship
though
the
modern
persians
as
mohammedans
allege
that
it
is
observed
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
the
prophet
mother
some
hours
after
the
close
of
a
splendid
ceremony
in
the
audience
chamber
chiefly
religious
at
which
the
shah
burns
incense
on
a
small
brazier
he
descends
to
the
garden
and
walking
alone
along
an
avenue
of
royal
guards
with
the
crown
of
the
kaj
rs
blazing
with
jewels
carried
in
front
of
him
he
seats
himself
on
an
alabaster
throne
the
foreign
ministers
having
been
received
previously
this
throne
is
a
large
platform
with
a
very
high
back
and
parapets
of
bold
stone
fretwork
supported
on
marble
lions
and
other
figures
and
is
ascended
by
three
or
four
steps
the
populace
which
to
the
number
of
many
thousands
are
admitted
into
the
garden
see
him
seated
on
his
throne
their
absolute
master
the
lord
of
life
and
death
a
voice
asks
if
they
are
content
and
they
say
they
are
a
hymn
of
congratulation
is
sung
a
chief
of
the

the
congratulations
of

the
hakim
of

people
hands
the
king
a
jewelled
which
he
smokes
and
showers
of
gold
fall
among
the
populace
the
british
minister
is
understood
to
be
at
this
time
the
most
powerful
foreigner
in
persia
and
as
we
drove
through
the
crowd
which
had
assembled
at
the
palace
gates
he
was
received
with
all
oriental
marks
of
respect
all
my
intercourse
with
persians
here
has
been
pleasant
and
if
i
mention
one
person
particularly
it
is
owing
to
a
certain
interest
which
attaches
to
himself
and
his
possible
future
and
because
some
hours
spent
at
his
splendid
palace
were
among
the
pleasantest
of
the
many
pleasant
and
interesting
ones
which
i
shall
hereafter
recall
yahia
khan
minister
of
justice
and
commerce
whose
official
title
is
was
formerly
minister
of
foreign
affairs
but
forfeited
the
confidence
of
the
british
government
in
supposed
connection
with
the
escape
of
ayoub
khan
and
being
suspected
of
russian
proclivities
which
he
denies
lost
his
position
he
speaks
french
perfectly
is
credited
with
very
great
abilities
and
not
only
has
courteous
and
charming
manners

way
an
important
personage
he
is
the
fourth
husband
of
the
shah
sister
who
has
had
a
tragic
life
and
is
a
very
accomplished
woman
her
first
husband
mirza
taghi
when
prime
minister
attempted
reforms
which
would
have
tended
to
diminish
the
hideous
corruption
which
is
the
bane
of
persian
officialism
and
consequently
made
many
enemies
who
induced
the
shah
then
a
young
man
to
depose
him
worse
than
deposition
was
apprehended
and
as
it
was
not
etiquette
to
murder
a
husband
of
a
royal
princess
in
her
presence
his
wife
who
loved
him
watched
him
night
and
day
with
ceaseless
vigilance
for
some
weeks
but
the
fatal
day
at
last
came
and
a
good
and
powerful
man
whose
loss
is
said
to
have
been
an
irreparable
one
to
persia
was
strangled
by
the
messengers
it
is
said
in
the
bath
her
son
who
has
married
the
shah
is
courteous
like
his
father
but
is
apparently
without
his
force
the
invited
me
to
breakfast
along
with
general
gordon
and
hassan
ali
khan
the
was
altogether
in
european
style
except
that
in
the
centre
of
the
table
among
lilies
and
irises
a
concealed
fountain
sent
up
jets
of
spray
s√®vres
and
dresden
porcelain
the
finest
damask
and
antique
and
exquisitely
beautiful
silver
adorned
the
table
the
cooking
was
french
the
wines
and
liqueurs
an
innovation
on
moslem
tables
now
common
but
of
recent
date
were
both
french
and
persian
the
service
was
perfection
the
host
conversed
both
thoughtfully
and
agreeably
and
expressed
himself
remarkably
well
in
french
afterwards
we
were
invited
to
go
over
the
palace
and
its
grounds
which
are
remarkably
beautiful
and
then
over
the
magnificent
mosque
shiah
mosques
are
absolutely
tabooed
to
christians
but
as
this
has
not
yet
been
used
for
worship
our
entrance
was
not
supposed
to
desecrate
it
when
quite
finished
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
magnificent
buildings
dedicated
to
religious
use
in
the
world
and
its
four
minarets
its
vast
dome
and
arches
and
fa√ßades
in
tiled
arabesques
and
conventional
patterns
and
exquisite
colouring
show
that
the
persian
artist
when
adequately
encouraged
has
not
lost
his
old
feeling
for
beauty
besides
the
mosque
there
is
a
fine
building
the
low
roof
of
which
is
supported
by
innumerable
columns
all
of
plain
brick
resembling
a
crypt
which
will
be
used
for
winter
worship
in
addition
a
lavish
endowment
has
provided
on
the
grounds
a
theological
college
and
a
hospital
with
most
if
not
all
of
the
funds
needed
for
their
maintenance
and
on
every
part
of
the
vast
pile
of
buildings
the
architect
has
lavished
all
the
resources
of
his
art
no
houses
are
to
my
thinking
more
beautiful
and
appropriate
to
the
climate
and
mode
of
living
than
those
of
the
upper
classes
of
persians
and
the
same
suitability
and
good
taste
run
down
through
the
trading
classes
till
one
reaches
the
mud
hovel
coarse
and
of
the
workman
and
peasant
my
memory
does
not
serve
me
for
the
details
of
the
palace
which
though
some
of
the
rooms
are
furnished
with
european
lounges
tables
and
chairs
in
and
brocade
is
throughout
distinctively
persian
but
the
impression
produced
by
the
general
and
by
the
size
height
and
perfect
proportion
of
the
rooms
galleries
staircases
and
halls
is
quite
vivid
the
rooms
have
dados
of
yezd
alabaster
in
slabs
four
feet
high
by
three
broad
clouded
and
veined
most
delicately
by
nature
the
banqueting
hall
is
of
immense
size
and
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
dark
fawn
of
an
inch
thick
made
i
understood
in
one
piece
eighty
feet
long
by
fifty
broad
the
carpets
are
the
most
beautiful
which
can
be
turned
out
by
persian
looms
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
the
roofs
friezes
and
even
the
walls
of
this
house
like
those
of
others
of
its
class
have
a
peculiarity
of
beauty
essentially
persian
this
is
the
form
of
or
fine
known
as
i
saw
it
first
at
baghdad
and
now
at
tihran
wonder
that
such
beautiful
and
costly
decoration
does
not
commend
itself
to
some
of
our
millionaires
arches
filled
with
honeycomb
decoration
either
pure
white
or
tastefully
coloured
and
gilded
are
among
the
architectural
adornments
which
the
alhambra
borrowed
from
persia
my
impression
is
that
this
exquisite
design
was
taken
from
snow
on
the
hillsides
which
is
often
fashioned
by
a
strong
wind
into
the
honeycomb
pattern
but
the
glory
of
this
form
of
decoration
reaches
its
height
when
after
the
ceiling
and
cornice
or
deep
frieze
have
been
daringly
moulded
by
the
workman
into
distinct
surfaces
or
facets
he
lays
on
mirrors
while
the
plaster
is
yet
soft
which
adhere
and
even
at
their
edges
have
scarcely
the
semblance
of
a
joining
sometimes
as
in
the
new
summer
palace
of
the
shah
third
son
the
the
whole
wall
is
decorated
in
this
way
but
i
prefer
the
of
yahia
khan
in
which
it
is
only
brought
down
a
few
feet
immense
skill
and
labour
are
required
in
this
process
of
adornment
but
it
yields
in
splendour
to
none
flashing
in
bewildering
light
and
realising
the
fabled
glories
of
the
palaces
of
the
one
of
the
about
sixty
feet
by
fifty
treated
in
this
way
is
about
the
most
beautiful
room
i
ever
saw
the
persian
architect
also
shows
great
art
in
his
windows
he
masses
them
together
and
by
this
means
gives
something
of
grandeur
even
to
an
insignificant
room
the
beauty
of
the
designs
whether
in
fretwork
of
wood
or
stone
is
remarkable
and
the
effect
is
enhanced
by
the
filling
in
of
the
interstices
with
coloured
glass
usually
amber
and
pale
blue
so
far
as
i
have
seen
the
persian
house
is
never
and
however
gorgeous
the
or
involved
the
arrangement
of
arches
or
daring
the
dreams
in
ceilings
and
pillars
the
fancy
of
the
designer
is
always
so
far
under
control
as
to
give
the
eye
periods
of
rest
under
the
palace
of
the
as
under
many
others
is
a
sort
of
glorified
used
in
hot
weather
partly
under
ground
open
at
each
end
and
finished
throughout
with
marble
the
roof
being
supported
on
a
cluster
of
slender
pillars
with
capitals
picked
out
in
gold
and
the
air
being
cooled
by
a
fountain
in
a
large
marble
basin
but
this
is
far
eclipsed
by
a
summer
hall
in
the
palace
of
the
shah
third
son
which
as
to
walls
and
ceiling
is
entirely
composed
of
the
floor
of
marble
being
arranged
with
marble
settees
round
fountains
whose
cool
plash
even
now
is
delicious
the
large
pleasure
gardens
which
surround
rich
men
houses
in
the
city
are
laid
out
somewhat
in
the
old
french
style
of
formality
and
are
tended
with
scrupulous
care
i
did
not
see
the
of
this
or
any
house
here
owing
to
the
difficulty
about
an
interpreter
but
it
is
not
likely
that
the
ladies
are
less
magnificently
lodged
than
their
lords
the
has
its
own
court
no
one
is
allowed
to
open
a
window
looking
upon
it
it
is
as
secluded
as
a
convent
no
man
but
the
master
of
the
house
may
enter
and
when
he
retires
thither
no
man
may
disturb
him
to
all
inquirers
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
say
that
he
is
in
the
to
the
shah
however
belongs
the
privilege
of
looking
upon
the
unveiled
face
of
every
woman
in
persia
the
domestic
life
of
a
moslem
is
always
shrouded
in
mystery
and
even
in
the
case
of
the
shah
the
fierce
light
that
beats
upon
a
throne
fails
to
reveal
to
the
outer
world
the
number
of
wives
and
women
in
his
which
is
variously
stated
at
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
and
ninety
it
is
not
easy
in
any
eastern
city
to
get
exactly
what
one
wants
for
a
journey
especially
as
a
european
can
not
buy
in
the
bazars
and
the
servant
difficulty
has
been
a
great
hindrance
particularly
as
i
have
a
strong
objection
to
the
regular
who
has
been
accustomed
to
travel
with
europeans
i
have
now
got
a
persian
cook
with
sleepy
eyes
a
portion
of
a
nose
and
a
grotesquely
look
for
an
interpreter
and
personal
attendant
i
have
an
educated
young
brahmin
for
some
years
in
british
service
in
the
gulf
and
lately
a
teacher
in
the
american
school
here
he
speaks
educated
english
and
is
said
to
speak
good
persian
he
has
never
done
any
menial
work
but
is
willing
to
do
anything
in
order
to
get
to
england
he
has
a
frank
independent
manner
and
no
nonsense
about
him
taking
him
is
an
experiment
footnotes
some
of
the
bakhtiari
khans
or
princes
with
their
families
are
kept
by
the
shah
as
hostages
in
and
round
tihran
for
the
loyalty
of
their
tribes
the
conquest
of
these
powerful
nomads
not
being
so
complete
as
it
might
and
possibly
will
be
on
the
eve
of
the
day
the
last
of
a
festival
of
ten
days
the
common
people
kindle
rows
of
bonfires
and
leap
over
them
and
though
not
on
the
same
day
but
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
sacred
in
the
armenian
church
as
the
day
of
the
presentation
of
our
lord
in
the
temple
large
bonfires
are
lighted
on
the
mud
roofs
of
the
armenians
of
the
persian
and
turkish
cities
and
the
younger
members
of
the
households
dance
and
sing
and
leap
through
the
flames
meanwhile
the
moslems
close
their
windows
so
that
the
sins
which
the
christians
are
supposed
to
be
burning
may
not
enter
whether
these
beltane
fires
are
a
relic
of
the
ancient
fire
worship
or
of
still
older
rites
may
be
a
question
among
the
christians
the
custom
is
showing
signs
of
passing
away
an
experiment
i
never
regretted
mirza
yusuf
was
with
me
for
nine
months
and
i
found
him
faithful
truthful
and
trustworthy
very
minimising
hardships
and
difficulties
always
cheerful
and
with
an
unruffled
temper
his
failings
being
those
of
a
man
transplanted
into
a
life
of
rough
letter
x
k√ªm
this
so
far
is
a
delightful
journey
all
the
circumstances
are
favourable
a
friend
who
was
sending
his
servants
horses
and
baggage
to
isfahan
has
lent
me
a
thoroughbred
and
with
a
trustworthy
young
soldier
as
my
escort
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
the
caravan
at
all
and
get
over
much
of
the
ground
at
a
gallop
the
roads
have
nearly
dried
up
the
country
looks
cheerful
travellers
are
numerous
living
and
dead
the
sun
is
bright
but
the
air
is
cool
and
bracing
and
the
insects
are
still
hybernating
mirza
yusuf
is
getting
into
my
ways
and
is
very
pleasant
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
have
liked
persian
travelling
so
well
a
good
horse
and
a
good
pace
make
an
immense
difference
it
is
not
the
custom
for
european
ladies
to
travel
unattended
by
european
gentlemen
in
persia
but
no
objection
to
my
doing
so
was
made
in
the
highest
quarters
either
english
or
persian
and
so
far
there
have
been
no
difficulties
or
annoyances
i
left
the
british
legation
at
noon
four
days
ago
the
handsome
arab
with
a
sheepskin
coat
rolled
on
the
front
of
the
saddle
holsters
and
persian
housings
looked
like
a
horse
i
nearly
came
to
grief
as
soon
as
i
got
out
of
the
legation
gate
for
he
would
not
stand
my
english
snaffle
and
reared
and
threw
himself
about
and
my
spur
touching
him
as
he
did
so
made
him
quite
wild
and
i
endured
much
apprehension
all
through
tihran
expecting
to
find
myself
on
the
rough
pavement
but
i
took
off
the
offending
spur
and
rode
him
on
the
sharp
bit
he
is
used
to
and
when
we
were
outside
the
gate
he
quietened
down
and
i
had
a
long
gallop
how
different
it
all
looks
no
more
floundering
through
mud
the
trees
of
abdul
azim
are
green
caravans
are
moving
fast
and
cheerily
even
the
dead
on
their
last
journey
look
almost
cheerful
under
the
sunny
skies
we
did
not
reach
husseinabad
till
long
after
dark
it
was
so
unspeakably
dark
that
my
horse
and
i
fell
off
the
road
into
deep
water
and
we
passed
the
caravanserai
without
knowing
that
we
were
near
it
the
usual
disorder
of
a
first
night
was
somewhat
worse
than
usual
the
loads
were
mixed
up
and
the
servants
and
were
quarrelling
and
i
did
not
get
my
dinner
till
ten
but
things
are
all
right
now
and
have
been
since
the
following
morning
when
i
assumed
the
reins
of
government
and
saw
the
mules
loaded
myself
an
efficient
interpreter
making
my
necessary
intelligible
though
the
spring
has
set
in
most
of
the
country
between
this
and
tihran
looks
a
complete
desert
in
february
it
was
a
muddy
waste
it
is
now
a
dusty
waste
on
which
sheep
goats
and
camels
pick
up
a
gray
herbage
which
without
search
is
not
obvious
to
the
human
eye
and
consists
mostly
of
wormwood
and
other
bitter
and
aromatic
plants
off
the
road
a
few
tulips
and
dwarf
irises
coming
up
out
of
the
dry
ground
show
the
change
of
season
i
came
for
some
distance
on
one
day
by
a
road
which
caravans
avoid
because
of
robbers
it
crosses
a
reddish
desert
with
a
few
salt
streams
and
much
saline
efflorescence
a
blasted
region
without
a
dwelling
or
patch
of
cultivation
yet
a
gallop
across
one
part
of
it
was
most
inspiriting
as
the
two
arabs
excited
by
the
pace
covering
great
spaces
of
ground
with
each
powerful
stride
dashed
over
the
level
gravel
i
thought
they
have
fleet
steeds
that
follow
but
no
steed
or
rider
or
bird
or
beast
was
visible
through
all
that
hungry
land
we
passed
also
close
to
a
salt
lake
on
the
kavir
seen
in
the
distance
on
the
former
journey
near
which
are
now
pitched
a
quantity
of
ilyat
tents
all
black
the
wealth
of
these
nomads
is
in
camels
sheep
and
goats
though
the
camps
five
in
number
were
small
they
had
over
camels
among
them
where
four
weeks
ago
there
was
deep
mud
there
is
now
the
glittering
semblance
of
unsullied
snow
and
the
likeness
of
frost
crystals
fills
the
holes
of
camels
loaded
with
cotton
march
with
stately
stride
in
single
file
the
noble
mountain
camel
with
heavy
black
fur
on
neck
shoulder
and
haunch
and
kindly
gentle
eyes
looking
as
he
is
the
king
of
baggage
animals
not
degraded
by
servitude
though
he
may
carry
lbs
some
of
the
sights
of
the
road
were
painful
for
instance
just
as
i
passed
a
caravan
of
the
dead
bound
for
k√ªm
a
mule
collided
with
another
and
fell
and
the
boxes
on
its
back
gave
way
and
corpses
fell
out
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decomposition
a
camel
just
dead
lay
in
a
gully
on
a
ledge
of
rock
above
it
seven
gorged
vultures
not
the
sat
in
a
row
they
had
already
feasted
on
him
to
repletion
i
passed
several
dead
camels
and
one
with
a
pleading
pathetic
face
giving
up
the
ghost
on
the
road
yesterday
i
rode
in
here
from
the
magnificent
caravanserai
of
shashgird
sixteen
miles
in
three
hours
before
lunch
and
straight
through
the
crowded
bazars
to
the
telegraph
office
unmolested
an
afghan
coat
with
the
wool
outside
having
proved
so
good
a
disguise
that
the
who
was
sent
to
meet
me
returned
to
his
master
saying
that
he
had
not
seen
a
lady
but
that
a
foreign
soldier
and
had
come
into
k√ªm
when
my
visit
was
over
and
i
had
received
from
lyne
the
route
to
isfahan
and
such
full
information
about
rooms
water
and
supplies
as
will
enable
me
to
give
my
own
orders
and
escape
from
the
tyranny
of
the
having
sent
the
horses
to
the
caravanserai
i
disguised
myself
as
a
persian
woman
of
the
middle
class
in
the
dress
which
lyne
wears
in
the
city
a
thick
white
veil
with
open
stitch
in
front
of
the
eyes
a
black
sheet
covering
me
from
head
to
foot
the
ends
hanging
from
the
neck
by
long
loops
and
held
with
the
left
hand
just
below
the
eyes
and
so
though
i
failed
to
imitate
the
totter
and
shuffle
of
a
persian
lady
walk
i
passed
unnoticed
through
the
long
and
crowded
streets
of
this
fanatical
city
attended
only
by
a
and
at
the
door
of
my
own
room
was
prevented
from
entering
by
the
servants
till
my
voice
revealed
my
identity
twice
i
have
passed
safely
through
the
city
in
the
same
disguise
and
have
even
lingered
in
front
of
shops
without
being
detected
and
lyne
have
made
the
two
days
here
very
pleasant
by
introducing
me
to
persians
in
whose
houses
i
have
seen
various
phases
of
persian
life
on
reaching
one
house
where
lyne
arrived
an
hour
later
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
be
received
by
the
host
in
uniform
speaking
excellent
french
but
without
a
lady
with
him
he
had
been
very
kind
to
hadji
who
he
says
is
rich
and
has
three
wives
the
poor
fellow
lungs
have
been
affected
for
two
years
and
the
affection
was
for
the
time
aggravated
by
the
terrible
journey
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
persian
social
customs
especially
polygamy
he
explained
that
he
has
only
one
wife
but
that
this
is
because
he
has
been
fortunate
he
said
that
he
regards
polygamy
as
the
most
fruitful
source
of
domestic
unhappiness
but
that
so
long
as
marriages
are
made
for
men
by
their
mothers
and
sisters
a
large
sum
being
paid
to
the
bride
father
a
marriage
is
really
buying
a
pig
in
a
poke
and
constantly
when
the
bride
comes
home
she
is
ugly
or
or
unpleasing
and
can
not
manage
the
house
this
he
said
makes
men
polygamists
who
would
not
otherwise
be
so
then
a
man
takes
another
wife
and
perhaps
this
is
repeated
and
then
he
tries
again
and
so
on
and
the
house
becomes
full
of
turmoil
there
are
always
quarrels
in
a
polygamous
household
he
said
and
the
children
dispute
about
the
property
after
the
father
death
had
he
not
been
fortunate
and
had
not
his
wife
been
capable
of
managing
the
house
he
said
that
he
must
have
taken
another
wife
for
he
added
no
man
can
bear
a
house
i
thought
of
the
number
of
men
in
england
who
have
to
bear
it
without
the
moslem
resource
a
lady
of
position
must
never
go
out
except
on
fridays
to
the
mosque
or
with
her
husband
permission
and
scrupulously
veiled
and
guarded
to
visit
her
female
friends
begin
to
wear
the
between
two
and
three
years
old
and
are
as
secluded
as
their
mothers
nor
must
any
man
but
father
or
brother
see
their
faces
some
marry
at
twelve
years
old
la

dans

tr√®s
triste
he
said
the
absence
of
anything
like
education
for
girls
except
in
tihran
and
the
want
of
any
but
the
koran
for
boys
and
girls
he
regards
as
a
calamity
he
may
be
a
pessimist
by
nature
he
certainly
has
no
hope
for
the
future
of
persia
and
contemplates
a
russian
occupation
as
a
certainty
in
the
next
twenty
years
after
a
long
conversation
i
asked
for
the
pleasure
not
of
seeing
his
wife
but
the
mother
of
his
children
and
was
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
a
gentle
and
lovely
woman
of
or
graceful
in
every
movement
but
her
walk
exquisitely
with
a
most
becoming
timidity
of
expression
mingled
with
gentle
courtesy
to
a
stranger
she
was
followed
by
three
very
pretty
little
girls
the
husband
and
wife
are
of
very
good
family
and
the
lady
has
an
unmistakably
look
though
i
knew
what
to
expect
in
the
costume
of
a
woman
of
the
upper
classes
i
was
astonished
and
should
have
been
scandalised
even
had
women
only
been
present
the
costume
of
ladies
has
undergone
a
great
change
in
the
last
ninety
years
and
the
extreme
of
the
fashion
is
as
lacking
in
delicacy
as
it
is
in
comfort
however
much
travelling
compels
one
to
realise
that
the
modesty
of
the
women
of
one
country
must
not
be
judged
of
by
the
rules
of
another
and
a
lady
costumed
as
i
shall
attempt
to
describe
would
avert
her
eyes
in
horror
by
no
means
feigned
from
an
english
lady
in
a
court
or
of
the
under
garment
very
much
is
a
short
chemise
of
tinselled
silk
gauze
or
muslin
so
transparent
as
to
leave
nothing
to
the
imagination
this
lady
wore
a
skirt
of
flowered
silver
brocade
enormously
full
ten
or
twelve
yards
wide
made
to
stand
nearly
straight
out
by
some
frills
or
skirts
of
very
stiffly
starched
cotton
underneath
the
whole
not
even
on
a
waistband
round
the
waist
but
drawn
by
strings
and
suspended
over
the
hips
the
skirts
coming
down
to
within
a
few
inches
of
the
knee
leaving
the
white
rounded
limbs
uncovered
the
effect
of
this
exaggerated
skirt
is
most
singular
white
socks
are
worn
over
the
transparent
or
chemise
she
wore
a
short
velvet
jacket
beautifully
embroidered
in
gold
with
its
fronts
about
ten
inches
apart
so
as
to
show
the
flowered
chemise
her
eyebrows
were
artificially
curved
and
lengthened
till
they
appeared
to
meet
above
her
nose
her
eyelashes
were
marked
round
with
and
a
band
of
paint
curving
downwards
above
the
nose
crossed
her
forehead
but
was
all
but
concealed
by
a
small
white
square
of
silk
on
the
head
and
brow
and
fastened
under
the
chin
by
a
brooch
had
she
been
in
another
house
she
would
have
worn
a
large
square
of
silk
with
the
points
in
front
and
behind
and
fastened
under
the
chin
under
the
square
there
was
a
small
of
velvet
matching
her
little
zouave
jacket
with
an
aigrette
of
gems
at
the
side
her
arms
were
covered
with
bracelets
and
a
number
of
valuable
necklaces
set
off
the
beauty
of
her
dazzlingly
white
neck
persian
ladies
paint
or
rather
smear
but
her
young
pure
complexion
needed
no
such
aids
her
front
hair
cut
to
the
level
of
her
mouth
hung
down
rather
straight
and
the
remainder
which
was
long
was
plaited
into
many
small
glossy
plaits
contrary
to
custom
it
was
undyed
and
retained
its
colour
most
persian
ladies
turn
it
with
indigo
or
auburn
with
and
with
the
latter
the
and
palms
of
the
hands
are
always
stained
her
jewellery
was
all
of
solid
gold
hollow
gold
and
silver
ornaments
being
only
worn
by
the
poor
she
wore
a
chain
with
four
scent
caskets
attached
to
it
exhaling
attar
of
roses
and
other
choice
perfumes
she
was
a
graceful
and
attractive
creature
in
spite
of
her
costume
she
waited
on
her
husband
and
on
me
that
is
she
poured
out
the
tea
and
moved
about
the
room
for
hot
water
and
with
the
feeble
tottering
gait
of
a
woman
quite
unaccustomed
to
exercise
and
to
whom
the
windy
wastes
outside
the
city
walls
and
a
breezy
gallop
are
quite
unknown
the
little
girls
were
dressed
in
the
style
of
adults
and
wore
tinselled
gauze
or
after
seeing
a
good
deal
of
home
life
during
some
months
in
persia
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
child
life
swaddled
till
they
can
walk
and
then
dressed
as
little
men
and
women
with
the
adult
tyrannies
of
etiquette
binding
upon
them
and
in
the
case
of
girls
condemned
from
infancy
to
the
seclusion
of
the
there
is
not
a
trace
of
the
spontaneity
and
nonsense
which
we
reckon
as
among
the
joys
of
childhood
or
of
such
a
complete
and
beautiful
child
life
as
children
enjoy
in
japan
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
child
talk
the
persian
child
from
infancy
is
altogether
interested
in
the
topics
of
adults
and
as
the
conversation
of
both
sexes
is
said
by
those
who
know
them
best
to
be
without
reticence
or
modesty
the
purity
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
charms
of
childhood
is
absolutely
unknown
parental
love
is
very
strong
in
persia
and
in
later
days
the
devotion
of
the
mother
to
the
boy
is
amply
returned
by
the
son
who
regards
her
comfort
as
his
charge
and
her
wishes
as
law
even
into
old
age
when
tea
was
over
the
host
retired
with
the
remark
that
the
ladies
would
prefer
to
amuse
themselves
alone
and
then
a
princess
and
another
lady
arrived
attended
by
several
servants
this
princess
came
in
the
black
silk
sheet
with
a
suggestion
of
gold
about
its
border
which
is
the
street
disguise
of
women
of
the
richer
classes
and
she
wore
huge
violet
trousers
into
which
her
voluminous
skirts
were
tucked
she
emerged
from
these
wrappings
a
harmony
in
rose
colour
a
comely
but
young
woman
in
rose
and
silver
brocade
skirts
a
rose
velvet
jacket
embroidered
in
silver
a
transparent
white
muslin
with
silver
stars
upon
it
and
a
of
white
muslin
embroidered
in
rose
silk
she
and
the
hostess
sat
on
a
rug
in
front
of
a
fire
and
servants
now
and
then
handed
them
the
three
little
girls
and
the
little
girl
were
in
the
background
the
doors
were
then
fastened
and
a
number
of
servants
came
in
and
entertained
their
mistresses
two
sang
and
accompanied
themselves
on
a
sort
of
tambourine
tea
was
handed
round
at
intervals
there
was
dancing
and
finally
two
or
three
women
acted
some
little
scenes
from
a
popular
persian
play
by
these
amusements
i
am
told
the
women
of
the
upper
classes
get
rid
of
time
when
they
visit
each
other
and
they
spend
much
of
their
lives
in
afternoon
visiting
taking
care
to
be
back
before
sunset
after
a
long
time
the
gentle
hostess
reading
in
my
face
that
i
was
not
enjoying
the
performances
on
which
indeed
unaccustomed
english
eyes
could
not
look
brought
them
to
a
close
and
showed
me
some
of
her
beautiful
dresses
and
embroidered
fabrics
putting
on
my
disguise
and
attended
by
a
servant
i
walked
a
third
time
unrecognised
and
unmolested
through
the
crowded
bazars
through
the
gate
and
across
the
bridge
when
a
boy
looked
quite
into
my
shroud
which
i
was
not
perhaps
clutching
so
tightly
as
in
the
crowd
and
exclaiming
several
times
ran
back
into
the
city
i
did
not
run
but
got
back
to
the
hotel
as
fast
as
possible
it
is
very
noisy
and
my
room
being
on
the
ground
floor
and
having
three
doors
there
is
little
peace
either
by
day
or
night
thirteen
days
from
the
or
new
year
which
was
march
are
kept
as
a
feast
before
the
severe
fast
of
the
ramazan
and
this
city
of
pilgrims
is
crowded
and
all
people
put
on
new
clothes
the
boys
being
chiefly
dressed
in
green
i
begin
my
journey
over
new
ground
b
letter
xi
kashan
i
have
seen
the
last
of
k√ªm
and
hotels
and
made
roads
for
many
months
so
much
the
better
i
had
to
ride
the
whole
length
of
the
bazars
and
the
city
a
mile
and
a
half
but
the
coat
served
again
as
a
disguise
and
i
heard
no
remarks
except
from
two
boys
indeed
i
am
delighted
to
find
that
the
foreign
soldier
who
rides
in
front
of
me
attracts
so
much
curiosity
that
i
pass
in
his
wake
unnoticed
the
ruinous
condition
of
k√ªm
is
fearful
once
outside
the
houses
and
bazars
which
surround
the
shrine
of
fatima
the
town
is
mostly
rubbish
and
litter
with
forlorn
miserable
houses
created
out
of
the
rubbish
grouped
near
festering
pools
broken
causeways
infamously
paved
full
of
holes
heaps
of
potsherds
bones
obtruding
themselves
nothing
to
please
and
everything
to
disgust
the
eye
and
sadden
the
spirit
religious
intolerance
a
diminished
population
and
desolation
the
pottery
bazar
abounding
in
blue
glazed
ware
of
graceful
shapes
and
a
number
of
shrines
of
saints
are
the
only
objects
of
interest
the
domes
of
the
latter
were
once
covered
with
blue
tiles
but
these
have
nearly
all
peeled
off
leaving
the
universal
mud
a
mud
so
everywhere
that
persia
may
be
called
the
great
mud
land
the
cherry
and
apricot
trees
are
in
full
bloom
but
as
yet
there
is
little
greenery
round
k√ªm
and
the
area
of
cultivation
is
very
limited
i
am
now
on
the
road
which
with
the
exception
of
that
from
tihran
to
resht
is
best
known
to
travellers
but
i
can
not
help
sketching
it
briefly
though
the
interests
are
few
considering
the
distance
travelled
miles
from
tihran
to
isfahan
i
now
see
persia
for
the
first
time
for
traversing
a
country
buried
in
snow
is
not
seeing
it
it
would
be
premature
to
express
the
opinion
that
the
less
one
sees
of
it
the
more
one
is
likely
to
admire
it
i
have
been
for
a
week
under
the
best
possible
circumstances
the
nights
always
cool
the
days
never
too
warm
the
accommodation
tolerable
the
caravan
in
excellent
working
order
no
annoyances
and
no
grievances
the
soldier
who
attends
me
arranges
everything
for
my
comfort
and
is
always
bright
and
kind
i
have
no
ambition
to
beat
the
record
but
long
gallops
on
a
fine
arab
horse
turn
marches
of
from
to
thirty
miles
into
delightful
morning
rides
of
from
three
and
a
half
to
four
and
a
half
hours
with
long
pleasant
afternoons
following
them
and
sound
sleep
at
night
these
are
my
halcyon
days
of
persian
travelling
and
yet
i
can
not
write
that
persia
is
beautiful
it
is
early
spring
and
tulips
and
irises
rise
not
out
of
a
carpet
of
green
but
to
use
the
descriptive
phrase
of
isaiah
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground
the
wormwood
is
dressed
in
its
the
buds
of
the
wild
show
their
tender
pink
the
starry
blossom
of
the
narcissus
gleams
in
moist
places
the
sky
is
exquisitely
blue
and
shining
fleck
the
brown
hillsides
with
violet
shadows
where
there
is
irrigation
carpets
of
young
wheat
cover
the
ground
but
these
like
the
villages
occur
only
at
long
intervals
for
the
road
passes
mainly
through
a
country
destitute
of
water
or
rather
of
arrangements
for
storing
it
as
to
natural
trees
there
are
none
and
even
the
bushes
are
few
and
unlovely
chiefly
camel
thorn
and
a
rigid
and
thorny
tamarisk
beyond
k√ªm
there
is
no
made
road
a
track
worn
by
the
caravans
of
ages
exists
sometimes
parallel
ruts
for
a
width
of
half
a
mile
sometimes
not
two
yards
wide
and
now
and
then
lapsing
into
illegibility
there
are
large
and
small
caravanserais
of
an
inferior
class
along
the
route
and
at
intervals
water
is
often
bad
and
sometimes
brackish
it
is
usually
supplied
from
small
brick
or
covered
reservoirs
milk
is
hard
to
obtain
often
impossible
at
some
places
fowls
can
be
bought
for
eightpence
each
and
flap
jacks
everywhere
except
the
snowy
cone
of
demavend
with
purple
ranges
curtaining
his
feet
no
special
object
of
admiration
exists
the
plains
are
reddish
yellowish
barren
gravelly
or
splotched
with
salt
the
ranges
of
hills
which
are
never
far
off
for
persia
is
a
land
of
mountains
are
either
shapeless
and
gravelly
or
rocky
rugged
and
splintered
their
hue
reddish
and
purplish
their
sides
scored
by
the
spring
rush
of
wasted
torrents
their
aspect
one
of
complete
desolation
yet
not
without
a
certain
beauty
at
this
season
in
the
early
morning
passing
through
shades
of
cobalt
and
indigo
through
the
day
and
dying
away
at
sunset
in
translucent
amethyst
against
a
sky
of
ruddy
gold
but
take
away
the
atmospheric
colouring
which
the
advancing
heat
will
abolish
and
the
plain
english
of
the
route
is
this
that
in
every
direction
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
the
country
is
a
salt
waste
or
a
gravelly
waste
with
a
few
limited
oases
of
cultivation
on
the
plains
and
in
the
folds
of
the
hills
always
treeless
except
round
a
few
of
the
villages
where
there
are
small
groves
of
poplars
and
willows
the
villages
are
clusters
of
mud
hovels
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
wastes
and
many
of
them
are
ruined
and
deserted
oppressive
exactions
or
a

of

once

now
deserts

such
is
persia
between
its
two
capitals
and
yet
i
repeat
that
in
cool
weather
and
on
a
good
horse
the
journey
is
a
very
pleasant
one
most
european
men
ride
that
is
post
but
from
what
i
see
of
the
horses
i
would
not
do
it
for
the
sake
of
doubling
the
distance
travelled
in
the
day
and
therefore
can
not
describe
either
its
pleasures
or
tortures
from
experience
on
certain
roads
as
from
tihran
to
shiraz
there
are
post
stations
with
horses
and
men
at
distances
of
from
twenty
to
miles
with
a
charge
of
one
eightpence
per
four
miles
for
each
horse
engaged
an
order
having
been
previously
obtained
from
a
government
official
besides
your
own
horse
you
have
to
take
one
for
the
or
who
has
to
take
the
horses
back
and
one
for
the
servant
the
two
latter
carry
the
very
limited
kit
which
includes
a
long
cotton
bag
which
being
filled
with
chopped
straw
at
night
forms
the
traveller
bed
the
custom
is
to
ride
through
all
the
hours
of
daylight
whenever
horses
are
to
be
got
doing
from
sixty
to
ninety
miles
a
day
always
inspired
by
the
hope
of
cutting
the
record
even
by
half
an
hour
and
winning
undying
fame
the
horses
which
are
kept
going
at
a
canter
so
long
as
they
can
be
thrashed
into
one
are
small
and
active
and
do
wonders
but
from
the
strain
put
upon
them
bad
feeding
sore
backs
and
general
dilapidation
and
exhaustion
are
constantly
tumbling
down
several
times
i
have
seen
wretched
animals
brought
into
the
yards
apparently
dead
beat
and
after
getting
some
chopped
straw
and
a
little
barley
thrashed
into
a
canter
again
for
miles
more
because
the
traveller
could
not
get
a
remount
they
often
fall
down
dead
under
their
riders
urged
by
the
heavy
whip
to
the
last
riding

in
a
or
litter
or
in
a
or
riding
caravan
pace
by
which
only
about
thirty
miles
a
day
can
be
covered
are
the
only
modes
of
travelling
in
persia
though
i
think
that
with
capable
assistance
a
carriage
might
make
the
journey
from
tihran
as
far
as
kashan
i
lodge
in
the
whenever
i
can
they
consist
of
mud
walls
fourteen
feet
high
enclosing
yards
deep
in
manure
with
stabling
for
the
horses
on
two
sides
and
recesses
in
their
inner
walls
for
mangers
the
entrance
is
an
arched
gateway
there
are
usually
two
dark
rooms
at
the
sides
which
the
servants
occupy
and
cook
in
and
over
the
gateway
is
the
an
abortive
tower
attained
by
a
steep
and
crumbling
stair
in
which
i
encamp
the
one
room
has
usually
two
doors
and
and
perhaps
a
window
space
or
two
and
the
ashes
of
the
last
traveller
fire
such
a
breezy
rest
just
suits
me
and
when
my
camp
furniture
has
been
arranged
and
i
am
enjoying
my
afternoon
tea
i
feel
monarch
of
all
i
survey
even
of
the
boundless
desert
over
which
the
cloud
shadows
chase
each
other
till
it
purples
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
if
there
is
the
desert
desolation
there
is
also
the
desert
freedom
the
first
halt
was
delicious
after
the
crowds
and
fanaticism
of
k√ªm
a
broad
plain
with
irrigated
patches
and
a
ruinous
village
was
passed
then
came
the
desert
an
expanse
of
gravel
thickly
strewn
with
stones
with
a
range
of
low
serrated
brown
hills
with
curious
stratification
on
the
east
a
few
caravans
of
camels
and
the
of
the
governor
of
yezd
in
alone
broke
the
monotony
before
i
thought
we
were
we
reached
the
the
small
brown
caravanserai
and
the
of
passangh
m
having
ridden
in
three
hours
a
distance
on
which
i
have
often
expended
eight
cool
and
breezy
it
was
in
my
room
and
cooler
and
breezier
on
the
flat
mud
roof
and
the
lifting
of
some
clouds
in
the
far
distance
to
the
north
beyond
the
great
sweep
of
the
brown
desert
revealed
the
mighty
elburz
range
white
with
snow
at
sinsin
the
next
evening
it
was
gloriously
cold
there
had
been
another
heavy
snowfall
and
in
the
evening
the
elburz
range
over
a
hundred
miles
away
rose
in
unsullied
whiteness
like
a
glittering
wall
and
above
it
the
colossal
cone
of
demavend
the
routine
of
the
day
is
simple
and
easy
i
get
the
caravan
off
at
eight
lie
on
the
floor
for
an
hour
gallop
and
walk
for
about
half
the
march
rest
for
an
hour
in
some
place
where
mahboud
the
soldier
always
contrives
to
bring
me
a
glass
of
tea
and
then
gallop
and
walk
to
the
where
i
rest
for
another
hour
till
the
caravan
comes
in
i
now
know
exactly
what
to
pay
and
by
giving
small
presents
get
on
very
easily
there
were
many
uncomfortable
prophecies
about
the
annoyances
and
rudenesses
which
a
lady
travelling
alone
would
meet
with
but
so
far
not
one
has
been
fulfilled
how
completely
under
such
circumstances
one
has
to
trust
one
there
are
no
fastenings
on
the
doors
of
these
breezy
rooms
and
last
night
there
was
only
the
longitudinal
half
of
a
door
but
i
fell
asleep
fearing
nothing
worse
than
a
predatory
cat
the
last
two
days
marches
have
been
chiefly
over
stony
wastes
or
among
low
hills
of
red
earth
gray
gravel
and
brown
mud
with
low
serrated
ranges
beyond
and
farther
yet
high
hills
covered
with
snow
after
which
the
road
leaves
the
hills
and
descends
upon
a
pink
plain
much
of
the
centre
of
which
is
from
saline
efflorescence
the
villages
kasseinabad
nasrabad
and
aliabad
are
passed
on
the
plain
with
small
fruit
trees
and
barley
surrounding
them
and
great
mud
caravanserais
at
intervals
only
remarkable
for
the
number
of
camels
lying
outside
of
them
in
rows
facing
each
other
in
the
fresh
keen
air
of
evening
the
cone
of
demavend
was
painted
in
white
on
the
faint
blue
sky
reddening
into
beauty
as
the
shadows
deepened
over
the
yellow
desert
tea
made
with
saltish
water
and
salt
sheep
milk
have
been
the
only
drawbacks
of
the
six
days
march
not
far
from
kashan
we
entered
on
a
great
alluvial
plain
formed
of
fine
brown
earth
without
a
single
stone
a
prolific
soil
if
it
had
water
as
the
fruit
trees
and
abundant
crops
of
young
wheat
round
the
villages
show
so
level
and
on
the
whole
so
smooth
is
this
plain
that
it
possesses
the
prodigy
of
a
public
conveyance
an
omnibus
with
four
horses
abreast
which
makes
its
laborious
way
with
the
aid
of
several
attendants
who
lift
the
wheels
out
of
holes
prevent
it
from
capsizing
and
temporarily
fill
up
the
small
irrigation
ditches
which
it
has
to
cross
its
progress
is
less
by
leaps
and
bounds
than
by
jolts
and
rolls
and
as
my
arab
horse
bounded
past
i
wondered
that
six
men
could
be
found
to
exchange
the
freedom
of
the
saddle
for
such
a
jerky
stuffy
box
five
hundred
yards
from
the
gate
of
kashan
there
is
a
telegraph
station
of
the
line
where
du
vignau
and
his
wife
expected
me
and
have
received
me
with
great
kindness
and
hospitality
the
electricians
at
these
stations
are
allowed
to
receive
guests
in
what
is
known
as
the
inspectors
room
and
they
exercise
this
liberty
most
kindly
and
generously
many
a
weary
traveller
looks
back
upon
the
inspectors
room
as
upon
an
oasis
in
the
desert
of
dirt
and
though
i
can
not
class
myself
just
now
with
weary
travellers
i
cordially
appreciate
the
kindness
which
makes
one
at
home
and
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
civilised
ideas
for
a
few
hours
i
must
not
go
beyond
kashan
without
giving
a
few
words
to
the
persian
section
of
the
telegraph
line
one
of
the
greatest
marvels
of
telegraph
construction
considering
the
nature
of
the
country
which
the
line
traverses
tihran
is
the
centre
of
telegraphic
control
and
the
residence
of
colonel
wells
the
director
with
a
staff
of
twenty
telegraphists
who
work
in
relays
day
and
night
and
a
medical
officer
julfa
is
another
place
of
importance
on
the
line
and
at
shiraz
there
is
another
medical
officer
the
prompt
repair
of
the
wires
in
cases
of
interruption
is
carefully
arranged
for
at
suitable
places
such
as
k√ªm
soh
kashan
and
other
towns
or
villages
from
fifty
to
eighty
miles
apart
there
are
control
or
testing
stations
each
being
in
charge
of
a
european
telegraphist
who
has
under
him
two
persian
horsemen
who
have
been
well
trained
as
linesmen
at
stated
hours
the
clerks
place
their
instruments
in
circuit
and
ascertain
if
all
is
right
if
this
testing
reveals
any
fault
it
can
be
localised
at
once
and
horsemen
are
despatched
from
the
control
stations
on
either
side
of
it
with
orders
to
ride
rapidly
along
the
line
until
they
meet
at
the
fault
and
repair
it
as
the
telegraph
crosses
passes
such
as
kuhr
d
at
an
altitude
of
over
feet
the
duties
of
both
inspectors
and
linesmen
are
most
severe
full
not
only
of
hardship
but
of
danger
in
terrible
winter
storms
and
great
depths
of
snow
yet
on
their
ceaseless
watchfulness
and
fidelity
the
safety
of
our
indian
empire
may
some
day
depend
the
skill
brought
to
bear
upon
the
manipulation
of
this
government
line
from
the
gulf
and
throughout
the
whole
system
of
which
it
is
a
part
is
wonderful
messages
from
any
part
of
the
united
kingdom
now
reach
any
part
of
india
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
and
in
only
about
one
word
in
two
hundred
does
even
the
most
trifling
mistake
occur
in
transmission
a
result
all
the
more
surprising
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
telegrams
are
almost
entirely
either
in
code
or
cypher
and
that
over
are
transmitted
in
the
course
of
a
day
among
these
are
the
long
despatches
continually
passing
between
the
viceroy
of
india
and
the
india
office
on
vitally
important
subjects
and
press
telegrams
of
every
noteworthy
event
the
exhaustive
summary
of
indian
news
which
appears
weekly
in
the
accompanied
by
a
commentary
on
events
is
an
altogether
telegram
and
is
transmitted
with
punctuation
complete
and
even
with
inverted
commas
for
quotations
the
english
staff
numbering
from
fifty
to
sixty
men
is
scattered
along
a
line
of
miles
some
of
them
are
married
and
most
occupy
isolated
positions
so
far
as
other
europeans
are
concerned
it
is
the
universal
testimony
of
englishmen
and
persians
that
the
relations
between
them
have
been
for
many
years
of
the
most
friendly
character
full
of
and
mutual
friendly
offices
and
that
the
continual
contact
brought
about
by
the
nature
of
the
duties
of
the
electricians
has
been
productive
not
of
aversion
and
distrust
but
of
cordial
appreciation
on
both
sides
footnotes
it
is
new
to
me
however
and
may
be
new
to
a
large
proportion
of
the
untravelled
many
for
whom
i
write
sir
murdoch
smith
late
director
of
the
persian
section
of
the
telegraph
read
a
very
interesting
paper
upon
it

one
of
the
hottest
places
on
the
great

has
the
rare
luxury
of
a
good
water
supply
brought
from
a
reservoir
some
distance
off
in
the
kuhr

it
has
a
population
said
now
to
number
souls
much
of
it
is
in
ruins
and
much
more
is
ruinous
it
has
a
thriving
colony
of
jews
it
is
noted
for
its
silks
and
velvets
but
the
modern
productions
are
regarded
by
judges
as
degenerate
it
is
still
famous
for
its
work
in
copper
and
for
its
great
copper
bazar
silk
produced
at
resht
is
brought
here
to
be
spun
and
dyed
then
it
is
sent
to
sultanabad
to
be
woven
into
carpets
and
is
brought
back
again
to
have
the
pile
cut
by
the
sharp
instruments
used
for
cutting
velvet
pile
and
the
finished
carpets
are
sent
to
tihran
for
sale
they
are
only
made
in
small
sizes
and
are
more
suitable
for
than
for
laying
on
the
floor
the
colouring
is
exquisite
and
the
metallic
sheen
and
lustre
are
unique
silk
carpets
are
costly
luxuries
the
price
of
even
a
fairly
good
one
of
very
small
size
is
the
silk
alone
costing
kashan
is
a
great
place
for
buyers
who
enlist
the
jews
in
their
service
there
are
some
valuable
antiques
in
this
house
embroideries
carpet
squares
in
silk
glass
whose
greenish
colour
and
grace
of
form
remind
me
of
venetian
glass
enamels
on
porcelain
tiles
metal
inlaying
and
damascening
pierced
brasswork
and
many
other
articles
of
the
art
of
making
which
is
either
lost
or
has
greatly
degenerated
it
is
unaccountable
but
it
is
certain
that
the
secret
of
producing
the
higher
types
of
beauty
in
various
arts
especially
the
keramic
died
out
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
that
there
are
no
circumstances
of
that
date
to
account
for
its
decease
except
that
it
is
recorded
that
when
the
afghan
conqueror
mahmoud
destroyed
isfahan
he
massacred
the
designers
of
tiles
and
other
keramic
beauties
because
they
had
created
works
which
gave
great
umbrage
to
the
sunni
sect
to
which
he
belonged
these
for
which
collectors
give
fabulous
sums
are
intrinsically
beautiful
both
in
the
elegant
conceptions
of
their
designs
and
the
fantastic
richness
of
their
colouring
there
are
designs
in
shades
of
brown
on
a
ground
or
in
blue
and
green
on
a
purple
or
umber
ground
some
of
them
with
a
pure
white
border
composing
the
rest
of
the
square
on
which
are
inscribed
phrases
from
the
koran
looked
at
from
above
or
frontwise
one
exclaims
what
a
beautiful
tile
but
it
is
on
turning
it
to
the
light
that
one
stereotyped
phrases
of
admiration
are
exchanged
for
silence
in
presence
of
a
singular
iridescence
which
transfigures
the
tile
making
it
seem
to
gleam
from
within
with
golden
purples
and
rosy
gold
the
mosaic
tiles
are
also
beautiful
especially
where
the
mosaic
is
on
a
or
ground
neither
of
them
reproducible
at
this
day
and
this
also
refers
to
other
shades
of
blue
and
to
various
reds
and
browns
of
exceeding
richness
the
art
of
making
which
has
been
lost
for
a
century
but
enough
of
art
possibly
there
may
be
a
resurrection
for
persian
art
but
in
the
meantime
aniline
dyes
tawdry
european
importations
and
western
models
without
either
grace
or
originality
are
doing
their
best
to
deprave
it
here
as
elsewhere
roads
from
tihran
gulpaigan
yezd
and
isfahan
meet
here
and
it
is
something
of
what
the
americans
call
a
distributing
point
but
it
is
a
most
uninviting
place
in
situation
and
general
aspect
and
its
unsightly
mud
ruins
as
in
other
persian
cities
are
eloquent
of
nothing
but
paralysis
and
retrogression
khurt

sunday
march
three
very
pleasant
marches
equal
to
miles
have
brought
me
here
and
now
isfahan
is
only
two
days
off
and
it
will
end
my
palmy
days
of
persian
travelling
the
first
day
march
from
kashan
was
only
seven
the
of
xenophon
miles
but
it
is
equivalent
to
owing
to
the
roughness
of
the
road
and
the
long
ascent
there
was
scarcely
any
ground
for
galloping
the
way
was
lost
once
and
the
march
took
over
eight
hours
the
track
for
only
in
places
did
it
attain
to
the
dignity
of
a
lay
for
hours
over
a
stony
desert
and
then
entered
the
mountains
where

halted
for
an
hour
at
the
once
magnificent
caravanserai
of
gaberabad
in
a
romantic
situation
but
falling
fast
into
ruins
and
deserted
for
no
reason
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
but
that
people
used
to
be
robbed
and
have
their
throats
cut
there
beyond
it
the
scenery
became
very
wild
and
the
rocks
and
mountains
highly
coloured
and
and
after
ascending
along
the
side
of
a
stream
and
up
a
causewayed
sort
of
stair
past
the
reservoir
which
supplies
kashan
with
water
we
entered
the
rising
valley
of
kuhr
d
where
the
snow
came
nearly
down
to
the
road
and
every
slope
was
terraced
and
every
level
cultivated
and
young
wheat
was
springing
and
fruit
orchards
flourished
with
green
sward
under
the
branches
and
great
poplars
in
picturesque
groups
towered
above
the
lower
woods
we
lost
the
way
in
the
snow
and
then
took
to
the
pebbly
river
as
the
safest
track
and
had
an
hour
of
fumbling
in
water
and
snow
under
apple
and
pear
trees
for
the
the
twilight
of
a
frosty
evening
was
coming
on
when
we
reached
the
village
of
kuhr
d
houses
in
terraces
on
a
mountain
side
and
clustering
round
a
fort
on
a
projecting
spur
it
is
surrounded
and
interpenetrated
by
groves
of
walnut
apricot
cherry
peach
plum
apple
pear
poplar
and
vine
with
roses
climbing
over
everything
and
planted
in
rows
like
vines
and
through
it
passes
a
fair
bright
stream
of
living
water
a
stream
whose
waters
fail
not
turning
the
mountain
valley
into
an
oasis
but
at
that
altitude
of
something
like
feet
the
buds
are
only
just
swelling
and
the
crimson
catkins
of
the
hazels
were
the
only
reminder
of
spring
it
is
the
one
place
that
i
should
care
to
revisit
the
snow
was
piled
in
great
heaps
in
the
village
and
against
the
wall
of
the
very
wretched
ruinous
in
which
i
sought
rest
and
shelter
mahboud
went
up
to
the
loft
over
the
gateway
and
came
down
looking
dejected
mustering
english
enough
to
say
no
no
mem
sahib
i
actually
had
to
occupy
one
of
the
two
gateway
rooms
an
inferior
stable
without
the
smallest
window
hole
and
no
door
except
two
unconnected
boards
with
which
one
could
cover
a
part
of
the
doorway
even
when
these
were
not
put
up
a
candle
was
necessary
it
was
freezing
hard
but
one
could
not
have
a
fire
because
there
was
no
the
walls
were
slimily
and
inkily
black
from
the
smoke
of
the
fires
of
people
who
were
less
particular
than
i
am
the
dust
and
rubbish
of
the
floor
were
swept
into
one
corner
if
one
wanted
a
place
to
store
boxes
in
and
looked
into
that
room
one
would
exclaim
dubiously
well
it
do
for
glass
and
china
mahboud
put
a
rug
on
the
floor
and
brought
a
bowl
of
delicious
milk
and
with
an
inverted
saddle
for
a
pillow
i
rested
quite
comfortably
being
too
tired
to
be
impatient
till
mirza
yusuf
arrived
with
my
luxuries
and
the
news
that
the
caravan
could
not
get
in
for
another
hour
for
that
several
of
the
mules
had
fallen
and
the
loads
were
slipping
round
constantly
indeed
it
was
ten
before
i
had
dinner
it
is
very
fortunate
to
have
an
attendant
always
cheerful
never
fussy
caring
nothing
for
personal
comfort
and
always
ready
to
interpret
the
called
with
the
usual
proffer
of
service
i
am
your
sacrifice
and
induced
me
to
buy
some
of
the
specialties
of
kuhr
d
in
bottles
without
corks
and
a
paste
made
of
pounded
walnuts
and
sugar
the
is
not
very
clear
but
it
has
much
of
the
overpowering
lingering
odour
of
attar
of
roses
kuhr
d
seems
prosperous
besides
exporting
large
quantities
of
and
walnut
paste
formed
into
blocks
and
done
up
in
white
skins
it
sends
wheat
and
fruit
in
abundance
to
kashan
freedom
good
sleep
and
satisfactory
travelling
make
up
for
all
annoyances
but
vermin
and
these
are
still
hybernating
in
that
precarious
privacy
i
slept
soundly
and
got
the
caravan
off
at
eight
the
next
morning
a
glorious
winter
morning
the
icy
roads
and
the
valley
glittering
with
frost
crystals
we
lost
the
way
again
among
the
pretty
orchards
then
got
into
a
valley
between
high
mud
mountains
whose
shapelessness
is
now
judiciously
concealed
by
snow
from
one
to
three
feet
deep
through
which
a
track
has
been
broken
a
foot
wide
it
is
six
miles
from
kuhr
d
to
the
summit
of
the
kuhr
d
pass
which
is
over
feet
and
it
grew
very
cold
and
gray
and
ragged
masses
of
cloud
swept
angrily
round
the
on
the
steepest
part
of
the
ascent
it
was
extremely
slippery
and
the
horses
not
being
roughed
slipped
badly
and
i
was
just
fearing
an
accident
to
my
borrowed
horse
and
planning
some
method
of
dismounting
when
down
he
came
on
his
nose
and
then
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
fell
several
times
again
in
his
struggles
to
get
up
his
feet
slipping
from
under
him
when
he
did
succeed
in
getting
on
his
legs
i
was
convinced
that
he
had
cut
his
knees
and
slipped
off
him
somehow
to
examine
them
but
my
fears
were
groundless
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
out
of
the
drift
into
which
i
had
descended
which
was
nearly
up
to
my
shoulders
his
nose
was
bleeding
a
little
but
that
was
all
there
was
no
way
of
remounting
on
a
path
a
foot
wide
between
walls
of
snow
and
besides
i
was
afraid
of
another
accident
so
i
slipped
the
snaffle
rein
over
his
head
and
led
him
it
was
horribly
slippery
and
having
nails
in
my
boots
i
fell
several
times
just
under
his
feet
but
the
sweet
creature
always
stopped
when
i
fell
from
the
top
there
was
a
truly
fearful
view
of
blackness
darkness
and
tempest
inky
mists
white
showing
momentarily
through
them
to
be
lost
again
and
great
sheets
of
very
deep
snow
soon
the
gathering
storm
burst
a
blizzard
in
which
the
snow
was
quite
blinding
snow
drifting
and
hissing
as
it
went
by
the
wind
tempestuous
mountains
valleys
path
obliterated
even
the
soldier
in
front
of
me
constantly
lost
to
sight
an
hour
of
this
and
i
could
walk
no
more
and
somehow
scrambled
into
the
saddle
at
the
foot
of
the
descent
the
sky
cleared
the
sun
shone
and
we
picked
up
the
caravan
which
had
had
rather
a
hard
time
the
succeeding
route
was
through
an
absolutely
uninhabited
and
uninhabitable
country
clay
and
mud
hills
purple
red
gray
pink
brown
an
utter
desolation
till
we
came
in
sight
of
the
and
at
a
distance
village
of
soh
in
a
keen
wind
with
frequent
snow
showers
soh
is
a
telegraph
testing
station
the
electrician
was
absent
but
had
kindly
left
directions
that
i
was
to
be
received
and
i
found
a
most
comfortable
quite
ready
a
little
later
an
englishman
riding
to
isfahan
threw
a
packet
of
english
letters
in
at
my
door
a
delightful
surprise
which
made
havoc
of
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
desolation
of
this
part
of
the
route
may
be
judged
of
from
the
fact
that
except
the
village
of
kuhr
d
there
is
not
an
inhabited
house
for
miles
the
country
traversed
reminds
me
much
of
the
least
interesting
part
of
the
route
from
lesser
tibet
into
kulu
yesterday
morning
there
was
ice
and
the
roads
were
very
slippery
on
the
gradual
descent
from
the
plain
which
opens
out
after
passing
bideshk
the
station
an
hour
from
soh
the
miles
ride
over
this
gravelly
waste
quite
uninhabited
was
very
pleasant
as
it
was
possible
to
gallop
much
of
the
way
and
besides
the
beauty
of
the
atmospheric
colouring
the
mirage
occurring
in
most
remarkable
forms
rendered
monotony
impossible
there
were
no
caravans
on
the
road
but
i
met
several
dervishes
and
there
is
one
here
to
whom
i
have
given
what
he
demanded
a
lodging
he
carries
a
large
carved
almsholder
and
the
panther
skin
on
his
shoulders
the
knotted
club
and
his
lean
hungry
fanatical
face
give
him
a
dangerous
look
all
i
have
seen
on
this
march
have
worn
long
matted
bushy
hair
often
covering
their
shoulders
an
axe
in
the
girdle
and
peculiar
turbans
decorated
with
phrases
from
the
koran
they
are
the
mendicant
friars
of
persia
and
are
under
vows
of
poverty
some
are
said
to
be
learned
but
they
object
to
discussing
religious
matters
with
infidels
and
almost
nothing
is
known
as
to
their
beliefs
they
hold
universally
the
sanctity
of
idleness
and
the
duty
of
being
supported
by
the
community
the
lower
classes
hold
them
in
reverence
and
the
upper
though
they
are
apt
to
loathe
them
treat
them
with
great
respect
for
fear
of
laying
themselves
open
to
the
charge
of
laxity
in
religious
matters
illustration
a
dervish
many
of
them
deal
in
charms
and
are
consulted
as
astrologers
some
are
professed
tellers
of
stories
to
which
i
am
told
no
european
could
degrade
himself
by
listening
but
which
are
most
palatable
to
a
village
audience
and
at
this
moment
this
unwelcome
guest
of
mine
has
a
crowd
listening
to
a
narrative
partly
told
and
partly
acted
they
are
credited
with
many
vices
among
the
least
of
which
are
hazy
ideas
as
to
mine
and
thine
opium
and
bhang
smoking
to
excess
and
drunkenness
they
have
recognised
heads
or
chiefs
to
whom
they
show
great
deference
one
of
their
vows
is
that
of
obedience
and
besides
paying
to
the
chief
a
part
of
the
alms
they
receive
he
gives
them
orders
as
to
the
houses
they
are
to
infest
and
though
the
nuisance
is
not
so
common
as
formerly
a
dervish
at
the
door
is
still
a
sign
of
being
great
or
rich
or
both
their
cries
and
their
rude
blasts
on
the
buffalo
horn
which
is
a
usual
part
of
their
equipment
are
most
obnoxious
in
the
larger
towns
such
as
k√ªm
and
kirmanshah
there
are
shops
for
the
sale
of
their
outfit
the
tiger
and
panther
skins
the
axes
the
knotted
clubs
the
almsbowls
etc
some
are
respectable
and
enjoy
much
consideration
and
i
hope
that
many
even
of
those
whom
a
careful
writer
has
called
disgusting
vagabonds
are
not
humbugs
but
the
presumption
is
so
much
the
other
way
that
i
am
always
glad
when
the
ground
admits
of
galloping
past
them
otherwise
the
dervish
comes
forward
with
his
knotted
club
much
with
many
compliments
and
good
wishes
or
else
silently
extends
his
almsholder
ejaculating
my
right
i
usually
have
the
means
of
appeasing
if
not
of
satisfying
him
but
on
the
rare
occasions
when
i
have
had
no
money
the
yells
and
maledictions
have
been
awful
the
light
and
profane
use
of
the
divine
name
is
universal
the
dervishes
curse
but
every
one
uses
the
name
wherever
they
can
bring
it
in
the
as
an
expression
of
fatigue
or
discontent
or
interest
or
nothing
is
heard
all
day
and
the
boy
who
drives
a
cow
or
a
team
or
a
mule
in
a
caravan
cries
incessantly
as
an
equivalent
of
go
along
and
the
gardener
pushing
his
spade
into
the
ground
the
chopper
with
every
blow
of
the
axe
the
labourer
throwing
up
bricks
ejaculates
the
same
interlard
all
conversation
when
men
are
building
the
perpetual
of
phrases
such
as
these
is
heard
brother
in
god
name
toss
me
a
brick
the
other
replying
brother
in
name
here
is
a
brick
the
vocabulary
of
abuse
is
also
very
large
and
often
involves
serious
reflections
on
the
female
relatives
of
the
person
abused
i
hear
such
harmless
phrases
as
son
of
a
burnt
father
son
of
a
dog
offspring
of
a
pig
on
all
occasions
murcheh
khurt
is
a
large
village
with
a
good
deal
of
cultivation
about
it
a
mosque
or
more
a
a
and
a
caravanserai
here
again
i
found
that
the
smart
foreign
soldier
attracted
all
the
notice
and
that
before
the
people
ceased
to
wonder
at
him
i
had
passed
them
the
was
full
of
men
so
i
have
had
to
sink
to
the
level
of
a
recessed
den
with
a
manger
in
front
in
a
ruinous
caravanserai
crowded
with
persian
travellers
muleteers
mules
horses
and
asses
and
the
courtyard
with
ruins
i
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
one
of
these
dens
before
travellers
have
exhausted
the
vocabulary
of
abuse
upon
them
possibly
they
deserve
it
in
the
vermin
season
but
there
is
nothing
worse
than
a
square
and
perfectly
dark
room
with
unplastered
walls
blackened
by
the
smoke
and
cobwebs
of
ages
and
a
door
which
will
not
fasten
the
air
is
cool
and
the
sky
blue
and
sitting
at
the
open
door
is
very
pleasant
mahboud
and
two
of
the
servants
caught
cold
at
kuhr
d
and
are
ill
and
my
arab
has
a
chill
too
he
is
a
very
stupid
horse
his
gentle
eyes
never
change
their
expression
and
his
small
ears
rarely
move
he
has
little
sense
or
affection
but
when
he
is
patted
his
proud
neck
takes
on
a
loftier
arch
gentle
as
he
is
to
people
he
is
a
brute
to
other
horses
he
would
like
to
fight
every
one
of
them
to
stand
on
his
and
grapple
them
round
the
shoulders
with
his
and
bite
their
necks
roaring
and
squealing
all
the
time
he
and
mahboud
horse
are
inveterate
enemies
and
one
of
the
few
difficulties
of
the
journey
is
the
keeping
them
from
a
regular
fight
this
village
is
an
oasis
in
the
desert
i
have
been
through
its
gates
barely
wide
enough
to
admit
an
ass
loaded
with
brushwood
with
the
and
mirza
walked
through
its
narrow
alleys
and
inadvertently
stumbled
into
a
mosque
where
a
great
crowd
of
women
were
listening
to
a
story
of
one
of
the
twelve
imams
told
by
a
looked
down
upon
it
and
over
the
adjacent
country
from
a
house
roof
visited
several
houses
in
which
some
of
the
inmates
were
ill
and
desired
feringhi
medicine
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
who
came
to
see
me
to
ask
for
eye
lotion
and
with
the
and
altogether
have
had
quite
a
pleasant
day
khana
i
am
sitting
in
one
of
the
three
doorless
doorways
of
my
loft
grieving
that
the
journey
is
just
over
and
that
this
is
the
last
night
of
the
exhilarating
freedom
of
the
desert
i
rode
miles
before
one
over
a
level
uncultivated
plain
bordered
as
usual
by
ranges
of
mountains
in
fact
while
i
write
of
levels
and
plains
it
must
be
understood
that
persia
is
chiefly
a
land
of
hills
rising
from
a
from
feet
to
feet
in
altitude
and
that
the
traveller
is
rarely
if
ever
more
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
from
mountains
from
to
feet
above
the
plain
from
which
they
rise
crowned
by
demavend
whose
imposing
summit
is
feet
above
the
sea
the
hills
beyond
isfahan
have
assumed
lofty
proportions
and
some
of
the
snowy
mountains
of
luristan
are
to
be
seen
in
the
far
distance
it
is
nearly
an
unmitigated
waste
between
murcheh
khurt
and
gez
destitute
even
of
tufts
of
wormwood
but
the
latter
part
of
the
march
is
through
a
stoneless
alluvial
desert
of
dry
friable
soil
soft
springy
galloping
ground
which
water
would
turn
into
a
paradise
of
fertility
and
water
there
has
once
been
for
not
far
from
the
road
are
the
remains
of
some
the
questions
naturally
arise
in
a
traveller
mind
first
what
becomes
of
the
enormous
amount
of
snow
which
falls
on
the
mountains
and
next
how
in
a
country
so
arid
as
the
plateaus
of
central
asia
water
for
irrigation
and
for
the
basins
and
fountains
which
abound
in
rich
men
houses
is
obtained
wells
unless
the
artesian
borings
shortly
to
be
begun
in
the
tihran
desert
should
be
successful
are
all
but
unknown
except
for
supplying
drinking
water
and
there
are
scarcely
any
reservoirs
but
ingenuity
has
devised
a
plan
of
subterranean
which
besides
their
other
advantages

tihran
has
of
them
and
the
water
which
they
distribute
is
naturally
expensive
as
the
cost
of
making
them
is
great
it
is
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
that
the
spring
is
found
which
is
the
original
source
of
supply
this
is
tapped
at
some
depth
and
its
waters
are
led
along
a
tunnel
about
four
feet
high
by
two
feet
wide
lined
with
baked
pottery
where
the
ground
is
soft
and
having
a
slight
fall
to
the
next
spring
or
well
which
may
be
from
to
even
sixty
yards
off
as
the
labourers
dig
they
draw
up
the
earth
and
arrange
it
in
a
circle
round
the
shaft
and
as
they
come
to
water
they
draw
up
the
mud
and
pour
it
on
the
top
of
the
earth
where
it
dries
and
hardens
and
below
the
water
is
conducted
as
a
running
underground
stream
across
great
plains
its
progress
marked
by
mounds
which
have
been
compared
to
and
craters
but
to
my
thinking
are
more
like
the
shafts
of
disused
mines
hundreds
of
these
are
seen
ruined
and
dry
and
are
the
resort
of
porcupines
and
jackals
to
construct
a
may
call
a
village
or
series
of
villages
into
being
the
letting
it
fall
to
ruin
is
one
cause
of
deserted
villages
those
which
are
not
lined
require
annual
repairs
which
are
now
going
on
but
frequently
the
complete
fall
of
the
roof
destroys
the
fall
of
the
water
and
the
tunnel
becomes
irreparable
the
peasants
are
obliged
to
buy
the
water
for
they
can
not
steal
it
and
the
making
of
a
is
often
a
lucrative
speculation
pigeons
live
in
them
and
many
of
them
are
full
of
fish
which
foreigners
amuse
themselves
by
poisoning
by
throwing
a
mixture
of
with
dough
down
the
wells
when
the
poisoned
but
wholesome
fish
rise
to
the
surface
they
usually
recover
when
they
are
left
in

as
having

feature
of
persia
ever
since
leaving
k√ªm
all
the
dry
and
hard
parts
of
the
road
have
been
covered
with
the
industrious
road
beetle
which
works
like
the
ant
in
concert
and
carries
on
its
activities
at
all
seasons
removing
from
the
road
to
its
nest
all
the
excreta
of
animals
except
in
regions
where
even
animal
fuel
is
so
exceptionally
scarce
that
boys
with
asses
and
ponies
follow
caravans
for
the
same
purpose
these
beetles
hover
over
the
road
on
the
wing
and
on
alighting
proceed
to
roll
the
ball
towards
the
nest
four
or
five
of
them
standing
on
their
and
working
it
forwards
or
else
rolling
it
with
their
heads
close
to
the
ground
their
instinct
is
wonderful
and
they
attract
the
attention
of
all
travellers
they
are
about
the
size
of
a
small
walnut
otherwise
there
is
little
of
animated
life
to
be
seen
on
this
route
no
day
has
had
fewer
noticeable
objects
two
or
three
several
caravanserais
in
absolute
ruins
and
a
magnificent
one
in
partial
ruins
are
its
record
gez
consists
of
this
and
a
decaying
caravanserai
from
the
roof
as
i
write
i
watch
the
grooming
of
a
whole
row
of
horses
as
each
pad
is
removed
there
is
a
horrid
revelation
of
wounds
deep
ulcers
sores
often
a
foot
long
and
in
some
cases
the
white
vertebr√¶
of
the
spine
are
exposed
these
are
the
wretched
animals
which
often
carry
men
from
fourteen
to
seventeen
stone
who
ride
fifty
miles
in
a
day
it
is
hard
enough
even
with
extreme
carefulness
to
keep
the
back
of
a
horse
all
right
on
a
continuous
journey
but
i
never
before
saw
animals
ridden
in
such
a
state
they
wince
pitifully
when
their
pads
are
put
on
again
the
desert
is
all
around
purpling
in
the
sunset
sweeping
up
to
low
broken
ridges
and
to
some
higher
hills
in
the
covered
with
snow
that
the
waste
only
requires
water
to
make
it
prolific
is
apparent
for
below
these
walls
wheat
is
growing
luxuriantly
in
some
deep
pits
irrigated
from
a
dirty
ditch
out
of
which
the
drinking
water
comes
nothing
can
be
got
except
by
sending
to
a
village
a
mile
away
four
of
the
men
are
ill
one
with
inflammation
of
the
eyes
another
with
an
abscess
and
a
third
a
very
strong
man
with
something
like
bilious
fever
and
a
with
malarial
fever
the
strong
moans
often
become
howls
he
insists
that
he
shall
die
these
two
afternoons
have
been
much
taken
up
with
making
poultices
and
medicines
and
i
shall
be
glad
for
the
poor
fellows
to
reach
isfahan
and
the
care
of
a
competent
doctor
april
i
daresay
this
journey
seems
longer
to
you
than
it
did
to
me
it
was
very
pleasant
and
its
goal
is
pleasant
and
a
most
kind
welcome
and
the
refinement
of
cultured
english
people
go
far
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
the
desert
freedom
and
the
easy
stride
of
the
arab
horse
i
started
the
caravan
at
nine
yesterday
with
two
men
with
bandaged
eyes
and
other
two
hardly
able
to
sit
on
their
mules
mahboud
who
is
really
more
seriously
ill
than
any
of
them
keeping
up
his
pluck
and
capableness
to
the
last
the
man
who
threatened
to
die
at
gez
was
very
much
better
the
next
morning
soon
after
leaving
gez
the
country
changes
its
aspect
the
road
becomes
very
bad
and
passes
through
nine
miles
of
rich
cultivation
wheat
barley
opium
and
vegetables
growing
abundantly
orchards
are
numerous
villages
with
trees
and
gardens
succeed
each
other
rapidly
water
abounds
and
before
the
gate
of
isfahan
is
reached
domes
and
minarets
rising
among
cypresses
planes
and
poplars
indicate
the
remains
of
the
former
capital
of
persia
inside
the
shabby
gateway
the
road
to
julfa
lies
among
rows
of
mean
mud
houses
heaps
of
ruins
and
shabby
provision
bazars
and
that
mile
or
more
of
isfahan
was
the
one
disagreeable
part
of
the
journey
it
was
about
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
and
the
bazars
alleys
and
open
spaces
were
full
of
men
in
gay
attire
and
companies
of
shrouded
women
were
moving
along
the
quieter
roads
it
was
too
warm
for
the
sheepskin
coat
which
had
served
me
so
well
at
k√ªm
and
i
had
dressed
with
some
regard
to
european
sensibilities
the
boys
began
to
shout
a
feringhi
woman
a
nazarene
woman
and
then
to
call
bad
names
then
men
began
to
make
up
fiendish
laughs
and
the
howls
and
outcries
gathered
strength
as
i
went
on
at
the
inevitable
foot
pace
spitting
being
quite
common
poor
mahboud
constantly
turning
to
me
a
perturbed
wretched
face
full
of
annoyance
at
the
insults
of
his
which
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
resent
it
was
a
bad
before
passing
the
residence
of
the
the
commander
of
near
the
julfa
gate
the
uproar
died
away
and
once
through
the
gate
and
in
the
four
gardens
there
was
peace
a
bad
road
of
cobble
stones
with
a
double
avenue
of
once
magnificent
planes
some
once
ornamental
tanks
very
high
walls
pierced
by
storied
gates
ornamented
with
wild
designs
on
plaster
in
flaring
colours
above
which
a
blue
dome
is
a
conspicuous
object
leads
to
a
handsome
bridge
of
arches
with
a
broad
level
roadway
and
corridors
for
foot
passengers
on
either
side
over
the
zainderud
then
came
fields
with
springing
wheat
a
few
houses
a
narrow
alley
and
two
or
three
miles
from
isfahan
the
gate
of
its
armenian
suburb
julfa
at
once
on
crossing
the
bridge
there
was
a
change
ruddy
unveiled
women
in
red
gowns
and
pure
white
completely
enveloping
their
persons
moved
freely
about
and
the
men
wore
neither
the
becoming
turban
nor
the
ominous
scowl
of
islam
in
the
quaint
narrow
streets
were
churches
with
open
vestibules
through
which
pictures
of
the
christ
and
of
madonnas
were
visible
priests
in
black
robes
and
women
in
white
glided
along
the
narrow
roads
there
was
the
fresher
purer
air
of
christianity
however
debased
and
corrupted
in
the
churches
divine
honours
are
paid
to
a
crowned
and
risen
christ
and
the
women
have
been
baptized
into
his
name
never
again
will
the
julfa
alleys
be
so
peaceful
and
lovable
as
yesterday
when
they
offered
a
haven
from
the
howling
bigots
of
isfahan
bruce
has
not
returned
from
baghdad
but
and
miss
bruce
welcomed
me
very
kindly
and
i
am
already
forgetting
my
unpleasant
reception
footnote
i
can
imagine
now
what
a
hellish
laugh
that
was
with
which
they
laughed
him
to
scorn
i
was
a
month
in
julfa
but
never
saw
anything
more
of
isfahan
which
is
such
a
fanatical
city
that
i
believe
even
so
lately
as
last
year
none
of
the
ladies
of
the
european
community
had
visited
it
except
one
or
two
disguised
as
persian
women

of
julfa
the
younger
julfa
is
a
place
wholly
destitute
of
superficial
attractions
consisting
as
it
does
of
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
alleys
closed
by
doors
and
plentifully
perforated
with
open
sewers
life
there
is
cribbed
confined
to
an
intolerable
degree
and
it
is
a
relief
to
escape
from
its
squalid
precincts
i
dare
not
write
thus
if
i
would
it
is
now
the
early
spring
the
sewers
are
clear
rapid
streams
margined
by
grass
and
dandelions
and
shaded
by
ash
trees
and
pollard
willows
in
their
first
flush
of
green
the
narrow
alleys
are
scrupulously
clean
and
there
is
neither
mud
nor
dust
if
i
go
up
on
the
roof
i
see
a
cultivated
oasis
gardens
prolonged
indefinitely
concealing
the
desert
which
lies
between
them
and
the
bold
mountain
ranges
which
surround
this
lofty
and
breezy
plain
every
breeze
is
laden
with
the
delicious
odour
of
the
bean
blossom
a
rapid
river
spanned
by
noble
bridges
hurries
through
the
oasis
it
has
helped
to
create
and
on
its
other
side
the
domes
and
minarets
of
isfahan
rise
out
of
masses
of
fine
trees
and
bridges
and
mosques
minarets
and
mountains
are
all
seen
through
a
most
exquisite
pink
mist
for
hundreds
of
standard
peach
trees
are
in
full
bloom
and
look
where
one
may
everything
is
de
i
quite
admit
that
julfa
consists
of
a
labyrinth
of
alleys
i
can
never
find
my
way
about
it
one
alley
with
its
shady
central
stream
or
sewer
its
roughly
paved
paths
on
either
side
its
mud
walls
pierced
by
low
doors
is
very
much
like
another
and
however
lucky
one
may
be
in
happening
on
the
right
road
it
is
always
a
weary
time
before
one
escapes
from
between
mud
walls
into
the
gardens
and
wheatfields
to
the
blossoming
beans
and
the
exquisite
among
the
wheat
as
to
the
cabined
cribbed
confined
life
i
can
give
no
testimony
from
personal
knowledge
all
life
in
european
settlements
in
the
east
appears
to
me
cabined
cribbed
confined
and
greatly
devoid
of
external
interests
perhaps
julfa
is
deficient
in
the
latter
in
an
eminent
degree
and
in
a
very
small
foreign
community
people
are
interested
chiefly
in
each
other
affairs
sayings
and
doings
lawn
tennis
picnics
and
dinner
parties
are
prevalent
the
ordinary
etiquette
of
european
society
prevails
and
in
all
cases
of
need
the
residents
are
kind
to
each
other
both
in
life
and
death
the
european
society
is
divided
into
three
circles
the
missionaries
the
mercantile
community
and
the
telegraph
staff
the
british
agent
aganoor
is
an
armenian
no
christians
armenian
or
european
live
in
isfahan
and
it
is
practically
to
european
women
this
transpontine
restriction
undoubtedly
narrows
the
life
and
interests
of
julfa
it
is
aggravating
and
tantalising
to
be
for
ever
looking
at
a
city
of
or
people
the
fallen
capital
of
the
sufari
dynasty
and
never
be
able
to
enter
it
this
christian
town
of
julfa
has
a
certain
accessible
historic
interest
shah
abbas
justly
surnamed
the
great
conceived
the
sagacious
project
of
introducing
among
his
persian
subjects
at
isfahan
then
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
magnificent
capital
the
christian
habits
of
trading
sagacity
and
thrift
for
then
as
now
the
armenians
had
commercial
dealings
with
china
india
and
europe
and
had
imported
several
arts
into
persia
this
project
he
carried
out
in
truly
despotic
fashion
by
moving
almost
the
whole
population
of
julfa
on
the
araxes
on
the
modern
frontier
to
the
banks
of
the
zainderud
making
over
to
it
the
best
lands
in
the
neighbourhood
of
isfahan
many
years
later
the
new
julfa
was
a
place
with
churches
great
prosperity
and
an
estimated
population
of
its
agriculturists
were
prosperous
for
the
huge
city
of
isfahan
and
it
had
likewise
a
great
trading
community
and
was
renowned
for
the
making
of
jewellery
and
watches
it
has
now
a
dwindling
population
of
about
chiefly
elderly
men
women
and
girls
the
young
men
after
receiving
a
good
education
in
the
church
mission
and
other
schools
flying
from
its
stagnation
to
india
java
and
even
europe
the
churches
are
reduced
to
twelve
and
these
with
the
vast
cemetery
in
the
desert
at
the
base
of
kuh
sufi
are
its
chief
objects
of
interest
apart
from
those
which
are
human
and
living
the
peach
blossoms
have
long
since
fallen
but
perhaps
i
still
see
julfa
de
even
after
three
weeks
so
very
great
is
the
kindness
under
this
roof
and
so
fully
is
my
time
occupied
with
various
interests
and
the
preparations
for
a
difficult
journey
this
as
you
know
is
the
church
mission
house
bruce
has
been
here
for
twenty
years
and
until
lately
when
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
mission
to
the
assyrian
christians
began
its
work
at
urmi
near
the
turkish
frontier
in
the
this
was
the
only
english
mission
in
the
empire
it
was
contemplated
as
a
mission
to
the
mohammedans
but
in
this
respect
has
been
an
apparent
failure
it
is
true
that
much
prejudice
has
been
disarmed
and
as
i
have
heard
from
some
leading
mohammedans
bruce
zeal
and
good
works
have
won
their
respect
a
large
part
of
the
bible
has
been
translated
into
persian
and
very
widely
circulated
through
the
adjacent
country
by
means
of
colporteurs
of
the
british
and
foreign
bible
society
his
preaching
of
christianity
is
listened
to
respectfully
and
even
with
interest
wherever
he
itinerates
and
moslems
daily
call
on
him
and
show
much
friendliness
but
the
results
as
results
are
usually
estimated
are
that
is
no
mohammedans
openly
profess
christianity
there
is
actual
though
not
legal
toleration
but
moslem
children
may
not
attend
a
mission
school
and
a
moslem
who
becomes
a
christian
loses
his
means
of
living
and
probably
his
life
is
sacrificed
to
fanaticism
in
consequence
of
these
difficulties
and
certain
encouragements
in
another
direction
the
work
of
the
mission
is
among
armenians
bruce
has
not
been
afraid
of
incurring
the
stigma
of
being
a
proselytiser
and
has
a
large
congregation
of
armenians
worshipping
after
the
english
form
being
communicants
of
the
church
of
england
on
easter
eve
there
was
an
evening
communion
and
the
great
row
of
women
kneeling
at
the
rail
in
the
pure
white
robes
which
cover
them
from
head
to
foot
and
then
moving
back
to
their
places
in
the
dim
light
was
very
picturesque
and
beautiful
good
works
have
been
added
one
after
another
till
the
mission
is
now
a
very
large
establishment
the
has
been
liberal
to
this
its
only
persian
agency
and
bruce
having
private
means
has
generously
expended
them
largely
on
missionary
work
in
julfa
the
chief
features
of
the
compounds
are
the
church
which
is
both
simple
and
ecclesiastical
in
its
exterior
and
interior
and
the
library
adjoining
it
where
bruce
works
at
the
translation
of
the
old
testament
into
persian
and
the
revision
of
the
new
aided
by
a
and
where
through
much
of
the
day
he
is
receiving
moslems
some
of
whom
come
to
inquire
into
christianity
others
for
religious
disputations
and
a
third
and
numerous
class
out
of
mere
friendliness
the
latter
are
generally
invited
into
the
mission
house
and
are
regaled
with
coffee
and
in
orthodox
persian
fashion
among
the
latter
visitors
has
been
the
who
came
to
ask
me
to
call
on
his
wife
accompanied
by
a
general
of
cavalry
whose
name
i
can
not
spell
and
who
speaks
french
remarkably
well
among
the
other
buildings
are
those
of
the
medical
mission
which
include
a
roomy
courtyard
where
the
animals
which
carry
the
patients
are
tethered
rooms
for
the
doctor
a
dispensary
and
with
for
both
sexes
and
rooms
above
in
which
serious
surgical
cases
are
received
for
treatment
and
where
at
present
there
are
eleven
patients
although
just
now
there
is
no
european
doctor
and
they
are
being
treated
by
the
native
assistants
most
kindly
helped
by
scully
of
the
telegraph
staff
this
hospital
and
dispensary
are
largely
taken
advantage
of
by
moslems
who
highly
appreciate
this
form
of
christian
benevolence
the
boys
school
with
pupils
has
been
a
great
benefit
to
julfa
the
johannes
was
educated
in
england
and
was
formerly
a
master
of
the
nassik
school
in
india
this
school
provides
the
education
of
one
of
our
best
schools
and
the
teaching
is
thorough
would
be
infinitely
despised
by
teachers
and
pupils
in
this
thorough
fashion
latin
french
the
first
four
books
of
euclid
and
algebra
are
taught
to
the
young
men
of
the
upper
form
the
boys
have
a
large
playground
with
a
great
tank
for
bathing
and
some
of
the
equipments
of
a
gymnasium
a
vaulting
pole
parallel
bars
etc
the
girls
schools
containing
girls
have
their
own
courtyard
and
they
need
enlarging
though
the
process
has
been
more
than
once
repeated
aidin
an
english
teacher
is
at
their
head
and
exercises
that
strong
influence
which
love
and
firmness
give
the
girls
are
a
mass
of
red
a
cool
red
without
yellow
and
when
they
disperse
they
enliven
the
julfa
alleys
with
their
carnation
dresses
and
pure
white
the
education
is
solid
and
suitable
and
special
attention
is
given
to
needlework
besides
these
there
is
an
orphanage
begun
for
the
benefit
of
those
whose
parents
died
in
the
famine
in
which
are
twenty
boys
outside
are
many
other
works
a
bible
house
from
which
colporteurs
at
intervals
proceed
on
journeys
a
young
men
christian
association
or
something
like
it
etc
etc
now
as
to
the
mission
house
itself
which
has
to
accommodate
and
miss
bruce
carless
a
clerical
missionary
and
two
english
lady
missionaries
so
much
has
been
written
lately
about
the
style
of
living
of
missionaries
their
large
houses
and
somewhat
unnecessary
comfort
in
general
that
i
am
everywhere
specially
interested
in
investigating
the
subject
having
formed
no
definite
opinion
on
the
question
whether
living
as
natives
or
living
as
europeans
is
the
more
likely
mode
of
producing
a
salutary
impression
the
mission
house
here
is
a
native
building
its
walls
and
ceilings
simply
decorated
with
pale
brown
arabesques
on
a
white
ground
there
are
a
bedroom
and
parlour
with
an
between
giving
access
to
both
from
the
courtyard
a
storeroom
and
a
kitchen
across
the
court
are
servants
quarters
and
a
for
natives
above
these
reached
by
an
outside
stair
are
a
good
room
occupied
by
carless
as
study
and
bedroom
and
one
small
another
stair
leads
to
two
rooms
above
some
of
the
girls
school
premises
having
enclosed
alcoves
used
as
sleeping
and
dressing
rooms
these
are
occupied
by
two
ladies
one
room
serves
as
for
the
whole
mission
party
at
present
six
in
number
and
as
and
workroom
books
a
harmonium
persian
rugs
on
the
floor
and
just
enough
furniture
for
use
constitute
its
luxury
there
are
two
servants
both
of
course
men
and
all
the
ladies
do
some
housework
at
present
the
only
horse
is
the
dispensary
horse
a
beast
of
such
rough
and
uneven
paces
that
it
is
a
penance
to
ride
him
the
food
is
abundant
well
cooked
and
very
simple
the
life
all
round
is
a
very
busy
one
visitors
are
never
refused
at
any
hour
the
long
flat
mud
roofs
from
which
one
can
see
the
gardens
and
the
hills
are
used
for
exercise
otherwise
some
of
the
party
would
never
have
anything
better
than
mud
walls
for
their
horizon
and
life
in
courtyards
is
rather
depressing
for
europeans
i
have
told
facts
and
make
no
comments
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
both
bruce
and
miss
v
a
lady
of
rare
devotion
who
has
lately
arrived
are
to
a
certain
extent
honorary
missionaries
and
have
the
means
if
they
had
the
desire
of
surrounding
themselves
with
comforts
this
is
about
the
mission
circle
with
which
i
have
become
acquainted
during
the
last
eight
months
and
i
see
in
nearly
all
the
same
difficulties
many
of
them
of
a
nature
which
we
can
hardly
realise
at
home
women
coming
to
the
east
as
missionaries
are
by
far
the
greatest
sufferers
especially
if
they
are
young
for
eastern
custom
which
in
their
position
can
not
be
defied
with
advantage
limits
free
action
and
abridges
all
the
comforts
of
independence
thus
a
woman
can
not
take
a
walk
or
a
ride
or
go
to
a
house
without
a
trusty
in
attendance
on
her
and
this
is
often
inconvenient
so
she
does
not
go
out
at
all
contenting
herself
with
a
walk
on
the
roof
or
in
the
courtyard
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
on
which
a
lady
leaves
her
own
country
soon
spends
its
force
the
interest
which
has
centred
round
her
for
weeks
or
even
months
is
left
behind
the
enthusiastic
addresses
and
farewell
meetings
the
journey
up
the
country
with
its
excitement
and
novelties
and
the
cordial
welcome
from
the
mission
circle
to
which
she
is
introduced
soon
become
things
of
the
past
the
circle
however
kind
has
its
own
interests
and
work
and
having
provided
her
with
a
necessarily
goes
on
its
own
way
more
or
less
and
she
is
left
to
face
the
fearful
difficulties
of
languages
with
which
ours
has
no
affinity
in
a
loneliness
which
is
all
the
more
severely
felt
because
she
is
usually
for
a
time
at
least
one
nominally
of
a
family
circle
unless
she
is
a
doctor
or
nurse
she
can
do
nothing
till
she
has
learned
the
language
and
the
difficulty
of
learning
is
increased
by
the
loss
of
the
flexible
mind
and
retentive
memory
which
are
the
heritage
of
extreme
youth
the
temptation
is
to
go
at
it
violently
then
come
the
aching
head
the
loss
of
sleep
the
general
lassitude
and
nervousness
and
the
as
to
whether
she
was
right
in
leaving
her
fruitful
work
in
england
then
instead
of
realising
the
truth
of
the
phrases
used
at
home
multitudes
flocking
as
the
doves
to
their
windows
fields
white
unto
the
harvest
she
finds
that
the
work
instead
of
seeking
her
has
to
be
made
by
her
most
laboriously
and
oftentimes
the
glowing
hope
of
telling
of
the
redeemer
love
and
death
to
throngs
of
eager
and
receptive
listeners
is
fulfilled
in
the
drudgery
of
teaching
sewing
and
the
rudiments
of
english
during
the
first
year
it
is
just
this
first
year
under
which
many
women
succumb
then
how
many
of
the
failings
and
weaknesses
of
the
larger
world
must
be
epitomised
in
a
mission
group
exposed
as
heyde
of
kyelang
feelingly
said
to
the
lowering
influence
of
daily
contact
with
a
courteous
and
heathenism
and
mohammedanism
missionaries
are
not
likely
to
possess
as
they
certainly
are
the
last
to
claim
superior
sanctity
and
the
dreaming
of
a
circle
in
all
respects
consecrated
finds
herself
among
frictions
strong
differences
as
to
methods
of
working
not
always
gently
expressed
and
possible
jealousies
and
criticisms
and
an
exaggeration
of
the
importance
of
trifles
natural
where
large
events
are
rare
a
venerable
american
missionary
in
turkey
said
believe
me
the
greatest
trial
of
missionaries
is
missionaries
the
small
group
is
frequently
destitute
of
social
resources
outside
itself
it
is
cut
off
from
friendly
visits
services
lectures
music
new
books
news
and
the
many
recreative
influences
which
all
men
regard
as
innocent
the
seems
at
times
thrown
away
the
heat
the
flies
and
the
mosquitos
are
depressing
and
exhausting
and
in
the
case
of
young
women
especially
till
they
can
use
the
language
colloquially
there
is
little
if
any
outside
movement
is
it
wonderful
that
supposed
slights
tiffs
criticisms
which
would
be
utterly
brushed
away
if
a
good
walk
in
the
open
or
a
good
gallop
were
possible
should
be
brooded
over
till
they
attain
a
magnitude
which
embitters
and
depresses
life
a
man
constantly
finds
the
first
year
or
two
very
trying
till
he
has
his
tools
the
language
at
command
and
even
men
at
times
rub
each
other
the
wrong
way
but
a
man
can
take
a
good
walk
or
a
solitary
gallop
or
better
still
a
week
of
itinerating
among
the
villages
people
speak
of
the
dangers
and
privations
of
missionary
life
i
think
that
these
are
singularly
but
the
trials
which
i
have
alluded
to
and
which
with
the
hot
climates
and
insufficient
exercise
undermine
the
health
of
very
many
female
missionaries
can
not
be
exaggerated
and
demand
our
deep
sympathy
i
do
not
think
that
the
ordinary
pious
woman
the
successful
and
patient
worker
in
district
visiting
bible
classes
mothers
meetings
is
necessarily
suited
to
be
a
foreign
missionary
but
that
a
heart
which
is
a
of
human
love
and
a
natural
enthusiasm
of
humanity
are
required
as
well
as
love
to
the
master
the
last
permeating
and
sanctifying
the
others
and
giving
them
a
perennial
freshness
fancy
g
grumbling
and
discontented
and
magnifying
unpropitious
trifles
when
her
heart
goes
out
to
every
chinawoman
she
sees
in
a
perfect
passion
of
love
with
the
missionary
whether
man
or
woman
the
case
is
different
the
work
seeks
the
worker
even
before
he
is
ready
for
it
claims
him
pursues
him
absorbs
him
and
he
is
powerful
to
heal
even
where
he
is
impotent
to
convert
i
have
been
to
the
hospital
to
see
a
woman
from
the
kuhr
d
mountains
who
was
brought
here
to
undergo
an
operation
she
had
spent
all
her
living
on
native
physicians
without
result
and
her
husband
has
actually
sold
his
house
to
get
money
to
give
his
wife
a
last
chance
of
recovery
fifteen
years
ago
this
man
nearly
took
life
now
he
says
the
fruits
of
christianity
are
good
daily
the
labyrinth
of
alleys
becomes
denser
with
leafage
and
the
sun
is
hot
enough
to
make
the
shade
very
pleasant
while
occasional
showers
keep
the
greenery
fresh
indeed
it
is
warm
enough
in
my
room
to
make
the
cool
draught
from
the
dg
very
pleasant
these
are
a
feature
of
all
persian
cities
breaking
the
monotony
of
the
flat
roofs
letters
can
be
sent
once
a
week
from
isfahan
and
there
is
another
opportunity
very
safe
and
much
taken
advantage
of
the
telegraph
a
british
official
messenger
who
rides
up
and
down
between
bushire
and
tihran
at
stated
intervals
the
persian
post
is
a
wretched
institution
partaking
of
the
general
corruption
of
persian
officialism
and
nowhere
unless
are
letters
less
safe
than
in
tihran
i
shall
send
this
scrappy
as
it
is
as
i
may
not
be
here
for
another
week

footnotes
since
my
visit
preece
then
and
for
many
previous
years
the
superintending
electrician
of
this
section
of
the

has
been
appointed
consul
the
increasing
dimensions
of
english
interests
and
the
increasing
number
of
resident
british
subjects
rendering
the
creation
of
a
consulate
at
isfahan
a
very
desirable
step
a
few
weeks
later
she
died
her
life
sacrificed
i
think
to
of
a
difficult
language
and
the
neglect
of
fresh
air
and
exercise
these
sentences
were
written
nearly
a
year
ago
but
many
subsequent
visits
to
missions
have
only
confirmed
my
strong
view
of
the
very
trying
nature
of
at
least
the
early
period
of
a
lady
missionary
life
in
the
east
and
of
the
constant
failure
of
health
which
it
produces
of
the
great
necessity
there
is
for
mission
boards
to
lay
down
some
general
rules
of
hygiene
which
shall
include
the
duty
of
riding
on
horseback
for
more
rigorous
requirements
of
vigorous
in
those
sent
out
and
above
all
that
the
of
those
who
are
chosen
to
be
epistles
of
christ
in
the
east
shall
be
such
as
will
not
only
naturally
and
specially
commend
the
gospel
but
will
stand
the
wear
and
strain
of
difficult
circumstances
nearly
all
my
letters
to
england
failed
to
reach
their
destination
letter

each

been
completely
filled
up

my

a

a

here
on
a
plan
of
my
own

the

in
the

and
it
really
looks
like

after
many
delays

pleasant
monotony
of
life
in

kindly
and
hospitable

a

on
the
kuh

from
which
there
is
a
very
fine
panoramic
view
of
the
vast
plain
and
its
surrounding
mountains
and
of
the
immense
ruins
of
isfahan
and
julfa
with
the
shrunken
remains
of
both
and
a
church
picnic
from
kuh
sufi
is
seen
how
completely
and
with
a
sharp
line
of
definition
the
arid
desert
bounds
the
green
oasis
of
cultivated
and
irrigated
gardens
which
surround
the
city
and
which
are
famous
for
the
size
and
lusciousness
of
their
fruit
from
a
confusion
of
ruinous
or
ragged
walls
of
mud
of
ruined
and
modern
houses
standing
complacently
among
heaps
of
rubbish
and
from
amidst
a
greenery
which
redeems
the
scene
the
blue
tiled
dome
of
the
a
few
minarets
and
the
great
dome
of
the
medresseh
denuded
of
half
its
tiles
rise
conspicuously
long
lines
of
mud
streets
and
caravanserais
gaunt
in
their
ruin
stretch
into
the
desert
and
the
city
once
boasting
of
inhabitants
and
a
splendid
court
survives
with
a
population
of
less
than
at
the
highest
estimate
the
church
picnic
was
held
in
a
scene
of
decay
but
people
with
all
the
women
but
three
in
red
enlivened
it
it
was
in
the
grounds
of
the
old
palace
of
haft
dast
in
which
fatteh
ali
shah
died
close
to
one
of
the
three
remarkable
bridges
of
isfahan
the
these
bridges
are
magnificent
their
construction
is
most
peculiar
and
their
roadways
being
flat
they
are
almost
unique
in
persia
the
though
of
brick
has
stone
piers
of
immense
size
which
are
arched
over
so
as
to
form
a
level
causeway
on
this
massive
structure
the
upper
bridge
is
built
comprising
a
double
series
of
rooms
at
each
pier
with
doorways
overlooking
the
river
and
there
are
staircases
and
rooms
also
in
the
upper
piers
the
chahar
bagh
bridge
is
also
quaint
and
magnificent
with
its
arches
some
of
them
very
large
its
corridors
for
foot
passengers
and
chambers
above
each
pier
each
chamber
having
three
openings
to
the
river
these
bridges
have
a
look
from
their
innumerable
windows
at
irregular
altitudes
and
form
a
grand
approach
to
the
city
as
at
first
so
now
at
last
the
most
impressive
thing
to
me
about
the
zainderud
next
to
its
bridges
is
the
extent
to
which
rinsing
one
of
the
processes
of
dyeing
is
carried
on
upon
its
shingle
flats
isfahan
dyed
fabrics
are
famous
and
beautiful
heavy
cottons
of
village
make
and
unbleached
cottons
of
manchester
make
being
brought
here
to
be
dyed
and
printed
there
is
quite
a
population
of
dyers
and
now
that
the
river
is
fairly
low
many
of
them
have
camped
for
the
season
in
little
shelters
of
brushwood
erected
on
the
gravel
banks
for
fully
these
banks
are
covered
with
the
rinsers
of
dyed
and
printed
calicoes
and
with
mighty
heaps
of
their
cottons
hundreds
of
pieces
after
the
rinsing
are
laid
closely
together
to
dry
indigo
and
turquoise
blue
brown
and
purple
madder
turkey
red
and
saffron
predominating
a
vile
aniline
colour
showing
itself
here
and
there
some
of
the
smaller
dyers
have
their
colour
vats
by
the
river
but
most
of
the
cotton
is
brought
from
isfahan
ready
dyed
on
donkeys
backs
with
the
rinsers
in
attendance
along
the
channels
among
the
shingle
banks
are
rows
of
old
millstones
and
during
much
of
the
day
a
rinser
stands
in
front
of
each
up
to
his
knees
in
water
his
methods
are
rough
and
the
cotton
must
be
good
which
stands
his
treatment
taking
in
his
hands
a
piece
of
soaked
cotton
from
fifteen
to
twenty
yards
long
he
folds
it
into
five
feet
and
bangs
it
on
the
millstone
with
all
his
might
roaring
a
tuneless
song
all
the
time
till
he
fails
from
fatigue
the
noise
is
tremendous
and
there
will
be
more
yet
for
the
river
is
not
nearly
at
its
lowest
point
when
the
piece
has
had
the
water
beaten
out
of
it
a
boy
spreads
it
out
on
the
gravel
and
keeps
it
wet
by
dashing
water
over
it
and
then
the
process
of
beating
is
repeated
the
coloured
spray
rising
from
each
millstone
in
the
bright
sunshine
is
very
pretty
each
rinser
has
his
watchdog
to
guard
the
cottons
on
the
bank
and
between
the
banging
splashing
and
singing
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
the
shouts
of
the
boys
it
is
a
noisy
and
cheery
scene
i
have
heard
that
certain
unscrupulous
english
makers
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
loaded
cottons
here
but
that
the
calico
printers
have
been
a
match
for
them
for
the
calico
printer
weighs
his
cloth
before
he
buys
it
washes
and
dries
it
and
then
weighs
it
again
a
man
must
get
up
very
early
if
he
means
to
cheat
a
persian
the
patterns
and
colours
are
beautiful
quilts
for
use
on
the
floor
and
are
often
things
of
exquisite
beauty
indeed
i
have
yielded
to
temptation
and
to
gratify
my
own
tastes
have
bought
some
beautiful
for
bakhtiari
women
printed
chiefly
in
indigo
and
brown
madder
on
a
white
ground
the
temptations
are
great
i
really
need
many
things
both
for
my
own
outfit
and
for
presents
to
the
bakhtiaris
and
pedlars
come
every
day
and
unpack
their
tempting
bundles
in
the
small
verandah
no
europeans
and
no
women
of
the
upper
classes
can
enjoy
the
delights
of
shopping
in
persia
consequently
the
pedlar
is
a
necessary
institution
here
they
are
of
the
humbler
sort
they
have
learned
that
it
is
useless
to
display
rich
turkestan
and
feraghan
carpets
gold
and
silver
jewellery
inlaid
arms
stuffs
worked
with
gold
thread
or
any
of
the
things
which
tempt
the
travelling
feringhi
so
they
bring
all
sorts
of
common
fabrics
printed
cambrics
worthless
woollen
stuffs
and
the
stout
piece
cottons
and
cotton
squares
of
isfahan
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
day
a
salaaming
creature
squatting
at
the
door
is
seen
caressing
a
big
bundle
which
on
seeing
you
he
pats
in
a
deprecating
manner
looks
up
appealingly
declares
that
he
is
your
sacrifice
and
that
with
great
trouble
and
loss
he
has
got
just
the
thing
the
wants
if
you
hesitate
for
one
moment
the
bundle
is
opened
and
on
his
first
visit
he
invariably
shows
flaring
manchester
cottons
first
but
if
you
look
and
profess
disgust
he
produces
cottons
printed
here
strokes
them
lovingly
and
asks
double
their
value
for
them
you
offer
something
about
half
he
recedes
and
you
advance
till
a
compromise
is
arrived
at
representing
the
fair
price
but
occasionally
as
about
a
if
they
see
that
you
admire
it
very
much
but
will
not
give
the
price
asked
they
swear
by
allah
that
they
will
not
abate
a
fraction
pack
up
their
bundle
and
move
off
in
indignation
probably
to
return
the
next
day
to
offer
the
article
on
your
own
terms
bruce
has
done
the
bargaining
and
i
have
been
only
an
amused
i
should
prefer
doing
without
things
to
the
worry
and
tedium
of
the
process
of
buying
them
the
higher
class
of
pedlars
such
as
those
who
visit
the
of
the
rich
go
in
couples
with
a
donkey
or
servant
to
carry
their
bundles
i
mentioned
that
the
had
called
and
had
asked
me
to
visit
his
wife
i
sent
a
message
to
say
that
my
entrance
into
isfahan
had
been
so
disagreeable
that
i
should
be
afraid
to
pass
through
its
gates
again
to
which
he
replied
that
he
would
take
care
that
i
met
with
no
incivility
so
an
afternoon
visit
was
arranged
and
he
sent
a
splendid
charger
for
me
one
of
the
finest
horses
i
have
seen
in
persia
a
horse
for
mirza
yusuf
and
an
escort
of
six
cavalry
soldiers
which
was
increased
to
twelve
at
the
city
gate
the
horse
i
rode
answered
the
description
a
neck
clothed
with
thunder
he
was
perfectly
gentle
but
his
gait
was
that
of
a
creature
too
proud
to
touch
the
earth
it
was
exhilarating
to
be
upon
such
an
animal
the
cavalry
men
rode
dashing
animals
and
wore
white
astrakan
high
caps
and
the
quite
filled
up
the
narrow
alley
where
it
waited
and
as
it
passed
through
the
chahar
bagh
and
the
city
gate
with
much
prancing
and
clatter
no
tongue
wagged
either
of
dervish
or
urchin
at
the
entrance
to
the
amir
house
i
was
received
by
an
and
a
number
of
and
was
conducted
into
a
long
room
opening
by
many
windows
upon
a
beautiful
garden
full
of
peach
blossom
violets
and
irises
the
table
was
covered
with
very
pretty
confectionery
including
piles
of
a
favourite
sweetmeat
made
of
manna
which
is
chiefly
collected
within
eighty
miles
of
isfahan
coffee
was
served
in
little
cups
in
filigree
gold
receptacles
and
then
the
appeared
in
a
white
uniform
with
a
white
lambskin
cap
and
asked
permission
to
have
the
honour
of
accompanying
me
to
the
persian
politeness
is
great
and
the
amir
though
i
think
he
is
a
turk
and
not
a
persian
is
not
deficient
in
it
such
phrases
as
my
house
is
purified
by
your
presence
i
live
a
thousand
years
in
this
visit
were
freely
used
this
man
who
receives
from
all
a
very
high
character
and
whom
moslems
speak
of
as
a
saint
is
the
most
interesting
moslem
i
have
met
in
one
sense
a
thoroughly
religious
man
he
practises
all
the
virtues
which
he
knows
almsgiving
to
the
extent
of
without
distinction
of
creed
charity
in
word
and
deed
truth
purity
and
justice
i
had
been
much
prepossessed
in
his
favour
not
only
from
high
opinion
of
him
but
by
the
unbounded
love
and
reverence
which
my
interpreter
has
for
him
mirza
yusuf
marched
on
foot
from
bushire
to
isfahan
without
credentials
an
alien
and
penniless
and
this
good
man
hearing
of
him
took
him
into
his
house
and
treated
him
as
a
welcome
guest
till
a
friend
of
his
a
moslem
a
general
in
the
persian
army
also
good
and
generous
took
him
to
tihran
where
he
remained
as
his
guest
for
some
months
and
was
introduced
into
the
best
persian
society
from
him
i
learned
how
beautiful
and
pure
a
life
may
be
even
in
a
corrupt
nation
when
he
bowed
to
kiss
the
amir
hand
with
grateful
affection
in
his
face
his
benefactor
as
he
always
calls
him
turned
to
me
and
said
he
is
to
me
as
a
dear
son
god
will
be
with
him
the
garden
is
well
laid
out
and
will
soon
be
full
of
flowers
the
amir
seemed
to
love
them
passionately
he
said
that
they
gave
rest
and
joy
and
are
the
fringes
of
the
garment
of
god
he
could
not
cut
them
he
said
their
beauty
is
in
their
completeness
from
root
to
petals
and
cutting
destroys
it
a
curtained
doorway
in
the
high
garden
wall
where
the
curtains
were
held
aside
by
servants
leads
into
the
court
of
the
where
flowers
again
were
in
the
ascendant
and
vines
concealed
the
walls
the
son
a
small
boy
met
us
and
kissed
my
hand
mirza
had
told
me
that
he
had
never
passed
through
this
wall
and
had
never
seen
the
ladies
but
when
i
proposed
to
leave
him
outside
the
amir
said
he
would
be
welcome
that
he
wished
for
much
conversation
and
for
his
wife
to
hear
about
the
position
and
education
of
women
in
england
the
beautiful
looked
something
like
home
the
pure
white
walls
and
honeycombed
ceiling
are
touched
and
decorated
with
a
pale
shade
of
blue
and
the
ground
of
the
patterns
of
the
rich
carpets
on
the
floor
is
in
the
same
delicate
colour
which
is
repeated
in
the
brocaded
stuffs
with
which
the
divans
are
covered
a
portrait
of
the
amir
in
a
uniform
with
his
breast
covered
with
orders
harmonises
with
the
general
scheme
of
colour
the
in
the
walls
are
utilised
for
vases
and
other
objects
in
alabaster
jade
and
bronze
a
covered
with
sweetmeats
a
tea
equipage
on
the
floor
and
some
chairs
completed
the
furnishing
the
amir
stood
till
his
wife
came
in
and
then
asked
permission
to
sit
down
placing
mirza
who
discreetly
lowered
his
eyes
when
the
lady
entered
and
never
raised
them
again
on
the
floor
she
is
young
tall
and
somewhat
stout
she
was
much
rouged
and
her
eyes
to
which
the
arts
of
the
toilet
could
add
no
additional
beauty
were
treated
with
and
the
eyebrows
artificially
extended
she
wore
fine
gray
socks
white
tights
a
black
satin
skirt
or
rather
flounce
embroidered
in
gold
so
with
flounces
of
starched
crinoline
under
it
that
when
she
sat
down
it
stood
out
straight
not
even
touching
the
chair
a
chemise
of
spangled
gauze
and
a
pale
blue
zouave
jacket
completed
a
costume
which
is
dress
not
clothing
the
somewhat
startling
effect
was
toned
down
by
a
beautiful
constantinople
silk
gauze
veil
sprigged
in
pale
pink
and
gold
absolutely
transparent
which
draped
her
from
head
to
foot
i
did
not
get
away
in
less
than
two
hours
the
amir
and
mirza
used
to
each
other
modes
of
expression
found
no
difficulties
and
mirza
being
a
man
of
education
as
well
as
intelligence
thought
was
conveyed
as
easily
as
fact
the
lady
kept
her
fine
eyes
lowered
except
when
her
husband
spoke
to
her
the
chief
topics
were
the
education
and
position
of
women
in
england
religion
politics
and
the
future
of
persia
and
on
all
the
amir
expressed
himself
with
a
breadth
and
boldness
which
were
astonishing
how
far
the
amir
has
gone
in
the
knowledge
of
the
christian
faith
i
can
not
say
nor
do
i
feel
at
liberty
to
repeat
his
most
interesting
thoughts
a
sunni
a
liberal
desiring
complete
religious
liberty
absolutely
tolerant
to
the
grateful
for
the
kindness
shown
to
some
of
them
by
the
british
legation
and
for
the
protection
still
given
to
them
at
the
house
admiring
bruce
persevering
work
and
above
all
the
medical
mission
which
he
regards
as
the
crown
of
beneficence
and
the
true
imitation
of
the
life
of
the
great
prophet
jesus
all
he
said
showed
a
strongly
religious
nature
and
a
philosophical
mind
much
given
to
religious
thought
all
true
religions
aim
at
one
thing
he
said
to
make
the
heart
and
life
pure
he
asked
a
good
deal
about
my
travels
and
special
objects
of
interest
in
travelling
and
was
surprised
when
i
told
him
that
i
nearly
always
travel
alone
but
after
a
moment
pause
he
said
i
do
not
understand
that
you
were
for
a
moment
alone
for
you
had
everywhere
the
love
companionship
and
protection
of
god
he
regards
as
the
needs
of
persia
education
religious
liberty
the
law
which
punishes
a
moslem
with
death
for
embracing
christianity
is
still
on
the
roads
and
railroads
and
asked
me
if
i
had
formed
any
opinion
on
the
subject
i
said
that
it
appeared
to
me
that
security
for
the
earnings
of
labour
and
equal
laws
for
rich
and
poor
administered
by
incorruptible
judges
should
accompany
education
i
much
fear
that
he
thinks
incorruptible
judges
a
vision
of
a
dim
future
the
subject
of
the
position
of
women
in
england
and
the
height
to
which
female
education
is
now
carried
interested
him
extremely
he
wished
his
wife
to
understand
everything
i
told
him
the
success
of
women
in
examinations
in
art
literature
music
and
other
things
and
the
political
wisdom
and
absolutely
constitutional
rule
of
queen
victoria
all
interested
him
greatly
he
asked
if
the
women
who
took
these
positions
were
equally
good
as
wives
and
mothers
i
could
only
refer
again
to
queen
victoria
an
oriental
can
not
understand
the
position
of
unmarried
women
with
us
or
dissociate
it
from
religious
vows
and
the
amir
heard
with
surprise
that
a
very
large
part
of
the
philanthropic
work
which
is
done
in
england
is
done
by
women
who
either
from
accident
or
design
have
neither
the
happiness
nor
the
duties
of
married
life
he
hopes
to
see
women
in
persia
educated
and
emancipated
from
the
trammels
of
certain
customs
but
he
added
all
reform
in
this
direction
must
come
slowly
and
grow
naturally
out
of
a
wider
education
if
it
is
to
be
good
and
not
hurtful
he
asked
me
what
i
should
like
to
see
in
isfahan
but
when
i
mentioned
the
prison
he
said
he
should
be
ashamed
to
show
it
and
that
except
for
political
offences
imprisonment
is
not
much
resorted
to
that
persian
justice
is
swift
and
severe
the
bastinado
not
incarceration
afterwards
i
paid
a
similar
visit
to
the
house
of
mirza
yusuf
other
benefactor
also
a
good
and
charitable
man
who
as
he
speaks
french
well
acted
as
interpreter
in
the
a
few
days
later
the
accompanied
by
general
faisarallah
khan
called
on
bruce
and
on
me
and
showed
how
very
agreeable
a
morning
visit
might
be
made
and
the
following
day
the
amir
sent
the
same
charger
and
escort
for
me
and
meeting
him
and
bruce
in
the
chahar
bagh
we
visited
the
a
combined
mosque
and
college
and
the
armoury
where
we
were
joined
by
two
generals
and
were
afterwards
entertained
at
tea
in
the
standard
room
while
a
military
band
played
outside
the
amir
had
ordered
some
artificers
skilled
in
the
for
which
isfahan
is
famous
to
exhibit
their
wares
in
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
armoury
and
in
every
way
tried
to
make
the
visit
more
agreeable
than
an
inspection
of
the
jail
he
advises
me
not
to
wear
a
veil
in
the
bakhtiari
country
and
to
be
as
european
as
possible
the
armoury
of
which
he
has
had
the
organising
does
not
fall
within
my
province
there
are
many
large
rooms
with
all
the
appliances
of
war
in
apparently
perfect
order
for
the
equipment
of
men
with
equal
brevity
i
pass
over
the
whose
silver
gates
and
exquisite
tiles
have
been
constantly
described
decay
will
leave
little
of
this
beautiful
building
in
a
few
years
the
tiles
of
the
dome
which
can
be
seen
for
miles
are
falling
off
and
even
in
the
halls
of
instruction
and
in
the
grand
mosque
under
the
dome
which
are
completely
lined
and
roofed
by
tiles
the
making
of
some
of
which
is
a
lost
art
one
may
augur
the
approach
of
ruin
from
the
loss
or
breakage
here
and
there
in
the
rooms
or
cells
occupied
by
the
students
who
study
either
theology
or
law
there
are
some
very
fine
windows
executed
in
the
beautiful
tracery
common
to
persia
and
kashmir
but
the
effect
of
beauty
passing
into
preventible
decay
is
very
mournful
isfahan
too
i
barely
notice
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
that
i
have
not
seen
it
though
a
fourth
part
of
it
is
in
ruins
and
its
population
is
not
an
eighth
of
what
it
was
in
the
days
of
shah
abbas
it
is
a
fairly
thriving
commercial
emporium
with
an
increasing
british
trade
indeed
here
russian
commercial
influence
may
be
said
to
cease
and
that
of
england
to
become
paramount
it
is
the
paradise
of
manchester
and
glasgow
cottons
woollen
goods
come
from
austria
and
germany
glass
from
austria
crockery
from
england
candles
and
kerosene
represent
russia
our
commercial
supremacy
in
isfahan
can
not
be
disputed
i
am
almost
tired
of
hearing
of
it
opium
tobacco
carpets
from
the
different
provinces
and
cotton
and
rice
for
native
consumption
are
the
chief
exports
opium
is
increasingly
grown
round
the
city
and
up
the
course
of
the
zainderud
of
the
cases
exported
worth
a
case
go
to
china
its
cultivation
is
so
profitable
and
has
increased
so
rapidly
to
the
neglect
of
food
crops
that
the
prince
governor
has
issued
an
order
that
one
part
of
cereals
shall
be
sown
for
every
four
of
the
opium
poppy
the
cotton
in
the
bazars
through
which
one
can
walk
under
cover
for
between
two
and
three
miles
is
of
the
best
quality
owing
to
the
successful
measures
taken
by
the
calico
printers
to
defeat
the
roguery
of
the
cheating
manufacturers
all
the
european
necessaries
and
many
of
the
luxuries
of
life
are
obtainable
and
the
isfahan
bazars
are
the
busiest
in
persia
except
those
of
tabriz
it
is
only
fair
to
this
southern
capital
to
say
that
if
one
can
walk
over
two
miles
under
the
roofs
of
its
fine
bazars
one
can
ride
for
many
miles
among
its
ruins
which
have
desolation
without
stateliness
and
are
chiefly
known
for
the
production
of
the
excellent
wild
asparagus
which
is
used
lavishly
on
european
tables
at
this
season
the
persian
versailles
the
palace
of
forty
pillars
each
pillar
formed
of
shafts
enriched
with
colour
and
intricate
work
and
resting
on
a
marble
lion
the
shaking
minarets
the
with
its
fine
dome
of
tiles
all
falling
into
premature
decay
remain
to
attest
its
former
greatness
the
other
noble
palaces
mosques
caravanserais
and
are
ruinous
the
superb
pleasure
gardens
are
overgrown
with
weeds
or
are
used
for
vetches
and
barley
the
tanks
are
foul
or
filled
up
the
splendid
plane
trees
have
been
cut
down
for
fuel
or
are
dragging
out
a
hollow
existence
every
one
as
elsewhere
in
persia
destroys
no
one
restores
the
armoury
is
the
one
exception
to
the
general
law
of
decay
yet
isfahan
covered
an
area
of
miles
in
circumference
and
with
its
population
of
souls
was
until
the
seventeenth
century
one
of
the
most
magnificent
cities
of
the
east
its
destruction
last
century
by
an
afghan
conqueror
who
perpetrated
a
fifteen
massacre
and
the
removal
of
the
court
to
tihran
have
reduced
it
to
a
mere
commercial
centre
a
distributing
point
and
as
such
its
remains
may
take
a
new
lease
of
life
it
has
a
newspaper
called
the
which
prints
little
bits
of
news
chiefly
personal
its
editor
moves
on
european
lines
so
far
as
to
have
interviewed
me
there
are
manufactures
in
isfahan
other
than
the
successful
printing
and
dyeing
of
cottons
earthenware
china
velvet
satin
tents
coarse
cottons
glass
swords
guns
pistols
jewellery

etc
the
plateau
on
which
isfahan
stands
about
seventy
miles
from
east
to
west
and
twenty
from
north
to
south
and
enclosed
by
high
mountains
with
a
striking
outline
lies
feet
above
the
sea
the
city
has
a
most
salubrious
climate
and
is
free
from
great
extremes
both
of
heat
and
cold
the
zainderud
on
whose
left
bank
it
is
situated
endows
much
of
the
plain
with
fertility
on
its
way
to
its
undeserved
doom
in
a
swamp
this
christian
town
called
a
suburb
though
it
is
really
two
and
a
half
miles
from
isfahan
is
a
and
nucleus
it
is
not
mixed
up
with
ruins
as
isfahan
is
they
have
a
region
to
themselves
chiefly
in
the
direction
of
the
kuh
sufi
my
impression
of
it
after
a
month
is
that
it
is
clean
and
curzon
is
that
it
is
squalid
i
prefer
mine
it
is
a
city
of
waters
streams
taken
from
a
higher
level
of
the
zainderud
glide
down
nearly
all
its
lanes
shaded
by
pollard
mulberries
ash
elm
and
the
willow
which
makes
the
best
firewood
and
being
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
grows
so
fast
that
it
bears
lopping
annually
and
besides
affording
fuel
supplies
the
twigs
which
are
used
for
roofing
such
rooms
as
are
not
arched
the
houses
some
of
which
are
more
than
three
centuries
old
are
built
of
mud
bricks
the
roofs
are
usually
arched
and
the
walls
are
from
three
to
five
feet
thick
all
possess
planted
courtyards
and
vineyards
and
gardens
into
which
channels
are
led
from
the
streams
in
the
streets
these
streams
serve
other
purposes
continually
a
group
of
armenian
women
may
be
seen
washing
their
clothes
in
them
while
others
are
drinking
or
drawing
water
just
below
the
lanes
are
about
twenty
feet
wide
and
have
narrow
rough
causeways
on
both
sides
of
the
it
is
difficult
on
horseback
to
pass
a
foot
passenger
without
touching
him
in
some
of
them
great
picturesqueness
is
given
to
these
leafy
lanes
by
the
companies
of
armenian
women
in
bright
red
dresses
and
pure
white
robes
slowly
walking
through
them
at
all
hours
of
daylight
visions
of
bright
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
soiled
white
robe
long
blank
mud
walls
low
gateways
an
occasional
row
of
mean
shops
open
porches
of
churches
dim
and
cool
and
an
occasional
european
on
foot
or
horseback
and
groups
of
male
armenians
whose
dress
so
closely
approaches
the
european
as
to
be
without
interest
and
priests
gliding
to
the
churches
are
all
that
is
usually
to
be
seen
it
sounds
dull
perhaps
many
of
the
houses
of
the
rich
armenians
some
of
which
are
now
let
to
europeans
are
extremely
beautiful
inside
and
even
those
occupied
by
the
poorer
classes
in
which
a
single
lofty
room
can
be
rented
for
twopence
a
week
are
very
pretty
and
appropriate
but
no
evidence
of
wealth
is
permitted
to
be
seen
from
the
outside
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
the
armenians
were
subject
to
many
disabilities
and
they
have
even
now
need
to
walk
warily
lest
they
give
offence
as
for
instance
an
armenian
was
compelled
to
ride
an
ass
instead
of
a
horse
and
when
that
restriction
was
relaxed
he
had
to
show
his
inferiority
by
dismounting
from
his
horse
before
entering
the
gates
of
isfahan
they
were
not
allowed
to
have
bells
on
their
churches
at
easter
i
wished
they
had
none
still
but
now
the
the
great
church
has
a
fine
campanile
over
feet
high
in
its
inner
court
the
ancient
mode
of
announcing
the
hours
of
worship
is
still
affectionately
adhered
to
however
it
consists
of
drumming
with
a
mallet
on
a
board
hanging
from
two
posts
and
successfully
breaks
the
sleep
of
the
neighbourhood
for
the
daily
service
which
begins
before
daylight
the
armenians
like
the
rich
persians
prudently
keep
to
the
low
gateways
which
with
the
absence
of
windows
and
all
exterior
ornament
give
the
lanes
so
mean
an
aspect
and
tend
to
make
one
regard
the
beauty
and
even
magnificence
within
with
considerable
surprise
in
england
a
rich
man
partly
for
his
own
delectation
and
partly
if
he
be
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
to
impose
his
position
ocularly
on
his
poorer
neighbours
displays
his
wealth
in
all
ways
and
on
most
occasions
in
persia
his
chief
pleasure
must
be
to
hoard
it
and
contemplate
it
for
any
unusual
display
of
it
in
equipages
or
furnishings
is
certain
to
bring
down
upon
him
a
squeeze
at
tihran
in
the
shape
of
a
visit
from
the
shah
with
its
inevitable
consequences
and
in
the
provinces
in
that
of
a
requisition
from
the
governor
for
a
man
to
enlarge
his
gates
is
to
court
destruction
poor
men
have
low
gates
which
involve
stooping
to
prevent
rich
men
servants
from
entering
their
houses
on
horseback
on
disagreeable
errands
christian
churches
have
remarkably
low
doors
elsewhere
than
in
julfa
to
prevent
the
moslems
from
stabling
their
cattle
in
them
rich
men
affect
mean
entrances
in
order
not
to
excite
the
rapacity
of
officialism
according
to
the
ancient
proverb
he
that
exalteth
his
gate
seeketh
destruction
proverbs
xvii
only
royal
gates
and
the
gates
of
officials
who
represent
royalty
are
high
the
armenian
merchants
have
like
the
europeans
their
offices
in
isfahan
the
rest
of
the
people
get
their
living
by
the
making
and
selling
of
wine
keeping
small
shops
making
watches
and
jewellery
carpentering
in
which
they
are
very
skilful
and
they
are
thrifty
and
industrious
and
there
is
very
little
real
poverty
the
selling
of
wine
does
not
conduce
to
the
peace
of
julfa
a
mixture
of
sour
wine
and
a
coarse
spirit
is
very
intoxicating
and
persians
when
they
do
drink
drink
till
they
are
drunk
and
the
abominable
concealed
traffic
in
liquor
with
the
moslems
of
the
town
is
apt
to
produce
disgraceful
brawls
wine
can
be
bought
for
fourpence
a
quart
but
the
upper
classes
make
their
own
and
it
costs
less
than
this
wines
are
both
red
and
white
and
one
red
wine
is
said
to
be
like
good
chianti
the
armenians
tipple
and
also
get
drunk
priests
included
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
jars
used
in
fermenting
are
between
and
years
old
the
excellent
education
given
in
the
schools
has
had
the
effect
of
stimulating
the
armenian
schools
and
of
producing
among
the
young
men
a
large
emigration
to
india
batavia
constantinople
and
even
england
only
the
dullards
as
a
rule
remain
in
julfa
some
rise
high
in
persian
and
even
in
turkish
employment
the
armenian
women
are
capital
housewives
and
very
industrious
in
these
warm
evenings
the
poorer
women
sit
outside
their
houses
in
groups
knitting
the
knitting
of
socks
is
a
great
industry
and
a
woman
can
earn
a
month
by
it
which
is
enough
to
live
upon
in
julfa
and
it
may
be
partly
owing
to
the
presence
of
a
european
community
the
christians
have
nothing
to
complain
of
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
they
are
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
persians
however
isfahan
is
full
of
religious
intolerance
which
can
easily
be
excited
to
frenzy
and
the
arrogance
of
the
has
increased
since
the
fall
from
almost
regal
state
of
the
the
eldest
son
into
the
position
of
a
provincial
governor
for
he
curbed
them
somewhat
and
now
the
restraint
is
removed
however
it
is
against
the
jews
and
the
rather
than
the
christians
that
their
hostility
is
directed
a
few
weeks
ago
some
were
peaceably
returning
to
a
neighbouring
village
when
they
were
attacked
and
seven
of
their
number
were
massacred
under
atrocious
circumstances
the
remainder
taking
refuge
for
a
time
in
the
british
telegraph
office
several
of
both
sexes
who
escaped
are
in
concealment
here
in
a
room
in
the
hospital
compound
one
of
them
with
a
broken
jaw
the
hiding
of
these
has
given
great
umbrage
to
the
bigots
of
isfahan
though
the
justified
it
on
all
grounds
and
about
the
time
i
arrived
it
was
said
that
a
thousand
city
fanatics
purposed
to
attack
the
mission
premises
but
at
one
of
the
mosques
there
is
a
who
with
wisdom
urged
upon
them
that
if
moslems
were
killed
nothing
would
happen
but
if
a
single
european
were
killed
what
then
i
can
not
close
this
letter
without
a
few
words
on
the
armenian
churches
some
of
which
i
visited
with
and
aganoor
and
others
with
bruce
the
ceremony
representing
the
washing
of
the
disciples
feet
on
the
armenian
holy
thursday
was
a
most
magnificent
one
as
regards
the
antique
splendour
and
extreme
beauty
of
the
vestments
and
jewels
of
the
officiating
bishop
but
the
feet
which
are
washed
in
and
anointed
are
not
as
in
rome
those
of
beggars
but
of
neophytes
costumed
in
pure
white
incense
embroideries
crowds
of
women
and
other
accessories
made
the
function
an
imposing
one
the
cathedral
a
part
of
the
monastery
has
a
narrow
winding
approach
and
a
thick
door
for
ecclesiastics
were
not
always
as
safe
as
they
are
now
in
the
outer
court
is
the
campanile
before
mentioned
the
floor
is
paved
with
monumental
slabs
and
among
the
graves
are
those
of
several
europeans
piles
of
logs
look
as
if
the
julfa
carpenters
seasoned
their
wood
in
this
court
the
church
is
divided
by
a
rail
into
two
compartments
the
dome
is
rich
with
beaten
gold
and
the
dado
is
of
very
fine
tiles
which
produce
a
striking
effect
the
embroideries
and
the
carpets
some
of
which
are
worth
fabulous
sums
are
between
two
and
three
centuries
old
the
vestments
and
ornaments
of
the
priests
are
very
fine
and
suggest
the
attire
of
the
aaronic
priesthood
it
is
a
striking
building
and
the
amount
of
gold
and
colour
toned
into
a
certain
harmony
by
time
produces
a
gorgeous
effect
the
outer
compartment
has
a
singular
interest
for
years
ago
its
walls
were
decorated
with
religious
paintings
on
a
large
scale
of
events
in
bible
history
from
the
creation
downwards
some
are
copies
others
original
and
they
are
attributed
to
italian
artists
they
are
well
worth
careful
study
as
representing
the
conceptions
which
found
favour
among
the
armenian
christians
of
that
day
they
are
terribly
realistic
but
are
certainly
instructive
especially
the
illustrations
of
the
miracles
and
parables
in
one
of
the
latter
a
man
with
a
huge
beam
sticking
out
of
one
eye
is
represented
as
looking
superciliously
with
the
other
at
a
man
with
an
insignificant
spike
projecting
the
death
of
dives
is
a
horrible
representation
his
soul
in
the
likeness
of
a
very
small
nude
figure
is
represented
as
escaping
from
the
top
of
his
head
and
is
being
escorted
to
the
entrance
of
the
lower
regions
by
a
flight
of
small
black
devils
the
idea
of
the
soul
emerging
from
the
top
of
the
head
is
evidently
borrowed
from
the
moslems
our
lord
is
i
think
everywhere
depicted
as
short
dark
and
with
eyebrows
much
curved
and
a
very
long
upper
lip
without
beauty
or
dignity
an
ordinary
oriental
workman
picture
of
the
cathedral
is
an
enormous
canvas
representing
the
day
when
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
nations
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
are
there
and
saints
and
angels
are
portrayed
as
worshipping
or
as
enjoying
somewhat
earthly
but
perfectly
innocent
delights
in
this
the
conception
is
analogous
to
those
celebrated
circular
pictures
in
which
the
buddhistic
future
is
unrolled
and
which
i
last
saw
in
the
monasteries
of
lesser
tibet
the
upper
or
heavenly
part
is
insignificant
and
very
small
while
the
torments
of
the
lost
in
the
lower
part
are
on
a
very
large
scale
and
both
the
devils
and
the
nude
human
sufferers
in
every
phase
of
anguish
have
the
appearance
of
life
size
the
ingenuity
of
torment
however
is
not
nearly
so
great
nor
are
the
scenes
so
revolting
as
those
which
oriental
imagination
has
depicted
in
the
buddhist
hells
a
huge
mythical
monster
represents
the
mouth
of
hell
and
into
his
flaming
and
smoking
jaws
the
impenitent
are
falling
does
any
modern
armenian
believe
that
any
of
those
whose
bones
lie
under
the
huge
blocks
of
stone
in
the
cemetery
in
the
red
desert
at
the
foot
of
kuh
sufi
have
passed
into
this
place
of
torment
the
other
church
which
claims
one
interest
though
not
used
for
worship
is
that
of
george
the
hero
of
the
fraudulent
contract
in
bacon
as
well
as
of
the
dragon
fight
to
whom
the
armenians
as
well
as
ourselves
render
singular
honour
this
church
is
a
great
place
for
miracles
of
healing
and
cells
for
the
sick
who
come
from
a
distance
are
freely
provided
in
a
covered
court
are
some
large
stones
in
a
group
one
of
them
evidently
the
capital
of
a
column
two
of
them
have
cavities
at
the
top
and
the
sick
kneel
before
them
and
as
the
voluble
women
who
were
there
told
us
they
first
pray
to
god
and
then
to
the
stones
and
finally
pour
water
into
these
cavities
and
drink
it
the
cure
is
either
instantaneous
or
occurs
at
any
time
within
fifteen
days
and
in
every
case
the
patient
hears
the
voice
of
george
telling
him
to
go
home
when
it
is
complete
these
stones
according
to
the
legend
told
by
the
women
and
popularly
believed
by
the
uneducated
took
it
into
their
heads
to
come
from
etchmiadzin
in
armenia
the
residence
of
the
in
one
night
and
deposited
themselves
where
the
church
now
stands
seven
times
they
were
taken
into
faraidan
eighty
miles
from
julfa
and
as
often
returned
and
their
manifest
predilection
was
at
last
rewarded
by
a
rest
of
centuries
there
were
a
number
of
sick
people
waiting
for
healing
for
which
of
course
fees
are
bestowed
the
armenians
especially
the
women
pay
great
attention
to
the
externals
of
their
religion
some
of
its
claims
are
very
severe
such
as
the
daily
service
before
daylight
winter
and
summer
and
the
long
fasts
which
they
keep
with
surprising
loyalty
among
the
poor
in
towns
and
in
the
villages
for
at
least
of
the
year
they
are
debarred
from
the
use
of
meat
or
even
eggs
and
are
permitted
only
vegetable
oils
fruits
vegetables
and
grain
spirits
and
wine
however
are
not
prohibited
i
really
believe
that
their
passionate
attachment
to
their
venerable
church
the
oldest
of
all
national
churches
is
fostered
by
those
among
them
who
have
ceased
to
believe
its
doctrines
as
a
necessity
of
national
existence
i
doubt
very
much
whether
the
reformed
congregations
which
have
been
gathered
out
here
and
elsewhere
would
survive
the
withdrawal
of
foreign
aid
rather
i
think
they
would
revert
to
the
original
type
superstitions
without
number
are
mixed
up
with
their
beliefs
and
are
countenanced
by
the
priests
the
or
holy
oil
used
in
baptism
and
for
other
purposes
has
the
stamp
of
charlatanism
upon
it
it
is
made
in
etchmiadzin
rose
leaves
are
collected
in
an
immense
vat
which
is
filled
with
water
and
at
a
set
time
the
monks
and
nuns
form
a
circle
round
it
and
repeat
prayers
till
fermentation
begins
they
claim
that
the
fermentation
is
a
miracle
due
to
the
prayers
offered
oil
probably
attar
of
roses
rises
to
the
surface
and
this
precious
is
sent
to
the
armenian
churches
throughout
the
world
about
once
in
four
or
five
years
in
persia
those
who
bear
it
are
received
with
an
or
procession
of
welcome
it
is
used
not
only
in
baptism
and
other
rites
but
at
the
annual
ceremony
of
washing
the
cross
at
christmas
when
some
of
it
is
poured
into
the
water
and
is
drunk
by
the
worshippers
in
the
villages
they
make
a
paste
by
mixing
this
water
and
oil
with
earth
which
is
made
into
balls
and
kept
in
the
houses
for
luck
if
a
dog
licks
a
bowl
or
other
vessel
and
thus
renders
it
unclean
rubbing
it
round
with
one
of
these
balls
restores
it
to
purity
at
a
village
in
faraidan
there
is
an
ancient
new
testament
reputed
to
be
of
the
sixth
century
to
this
people
come
on
pilgrimage
from
all
quarters
even
from
fars
tihran
and
armenia
to
be
healed
of
their
diseases
and
they
make
offerings
to
it
and
practically
render
it
worship
to
go
and
pray
on
a
grave
is
a
remedy
for
childlessness
much
resorted
to
by
childless
wives
when
two
boys
fight
and
one
of
them
is
hurt
or
when
any
one
is
injured
by
a
dog
or
by
a
tree
falling
they
wash
the
damaged
person
in
water
and
then
throw
the
water
over
the
boy
dog
or
tree
which
has
been
the
cause
of
the
injury
believing
that
in
this
way
the
mischief
is
transferred
when
any
one
is
ill
of
fright
and
the
cause
is
not
known
the
nuns
come
to
the
house
and
pour
wax
into
a
basin
of
boiling
water
noting
the
form
it
takes
such
as
a
snake
a
dog
or
a
frog
in
a
case
lately
they
went
out
and
killed
a
snake
for
the
thing
whose
form
the
wax
takes
ought
to
be
killed
but
as
this
might
often
be
difficult
or
unsuitable
they
compromise
the
matter
by
throwing
the
water
not
boiling
i
hope
over
the
nearest
dog
or
toad
or
anything
else
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
culprit
on
the
first
monday
in
lent
the
women
wash
their
knitting
needles
for
luck
in
a
stream
which
runs
through
julfa
the
children
educated
in
the
mission
schools
laugh
at
these
and
many
other
superstitions
the
dress
of
the
armenian
women
is
very
showy
but
too
much
of
a
red
is
the
dominant
colour
a
carnation
red
with
white
patterns
sprawling
over
it
they
wear
coloured
trousers
concealed
by
a
long
skirt
the
visible
is
a
long
shaped
dress
of
turkey
red
over
this
is
worn
a
somewhat
scanty
gown
of
red
and
white
cotton
open
in
front
and
very
and
over
this
a
plain
red
pelisse
or
outer
garment
often
quilted
open
in
front
gashed
up
the
sides
and
falling
below
the
knees
of
course
this
costume
is
liable
to
many
modifications
in
the
way
of
material
and
embroidered
jackets
heavily
trimmed
with
jewellery
and
the
like
as
fashion
is
unchanging
the
acquisition
and
hoarding
of
garments
are
carried
to
a
great
extent
there
are
two
marked
features
of
armenian
dress
one
the
massive
silver
girdle
made
of
heavy
links
four
inches
long
by
two
deep
often
antique
and
always
of
antique
design
which
falls
much
below
the
waist
in
front
and
is
used
to
confine
the
ends
of
the
white
sheet
which
envelops
an
armenian
woman
out
of
doors
so
that
it
may
hang
evenly
all
round
the
other
is
a
of
embroidered
silk
or
cloth
placed
well
back
on
the
head
above
the
many
hanging
plaits
in
which
the
hair
is
worn
with
a
black
velvet
coronet
in
front
from
which
among
the
richer
women
rows
of
coins
depend
this
which
is
very
becoming
to
the
brilliant
complexion
and
comely
face
below
it
is
in
its
turn
covered
by
a
half
handkerchief
and
over
this
is
gracefully
worn
when
not
gracelessly
clutched
a
or
drapery
of
printed
cambric
or
muslin
a
white
band
bound
across
the
chin
up
to
the
lips

a
broken
jaw
and
the
of
the
various
wrappings
of
the
head
a
perennial
toothache
footnote
i
have
written
nothing
about
this
sect
of
the
partly
because
being
a
secret
sect
i
doubt
whether
the
doctrines
which
are
suffered
to
leak
out
form
really
any
part
of
its
esoteric
teaching
and
partly
because
those
europeans
who
have
studied
the
most
candidly
are
diametrically
opposed
in
their
views
of
their
tenets
and
practice
some
holding
that
their
aspirations
are
after
a
purer
life
while
others
and
i
think
a
majority
believe
that
their
teachings
are
subversive
of
morality
and
of
the
purity
of
domestic
life

julfa
you
will
be
tired
of
julfa
though
i
am
not
i
fully
expected
to
have
left
it
a
fortnight
ago
but
unavoidable
delays
have
occurred
my
caravan
and
servants
started
this
morning
and
i
leave
myself
in
a
few
hours
upon
my
horse
i
have
bestowed
the
suggestive
name
of
he
is
fairly
bright
bay
slightly
and
with
his
fore
hoofs
split
in
several
places
from
the
coronet
nearly
to
the
shoe
he
is
an
undoubted
and
has
carried
loads
for
many
a
day
he
has
a
long
stride
shies
badly
walks
very
fast
canters
easily
and
at
present
shows
no
tendency
to
tumble
down
i
have
had
pleasant
rides
alone
crossing
the
definite
dividing
line
between
the
desert
and
the
oasis
of
cultivation
and
irrigation
watching
the
daily
development
of
the
various
crops
and
the
brief
life
of
the
wild
flowers
creeping
through
the
green
fields
on
the
narrow
margins
of
irrigating
ditches
down
to
the
and
returning
to
the
green
lanes
of
julfa
by
the
bright
waters
of
the
zainderud
crimsoning
in
the
setting
sun
for
in
the
late
cool
and
breezy
weather
not
altogether
free
from
clouds
and
showers
there
have
been
some
gorgeous
sunsets
and
magnificent
colouring
of
the
depth
and
richness
which
people
call
tropical
has
blazed
extravagantly
and
from
the
violet
desert
to
the
indigo
on
the
still
kuhr
d
mountains
from
the
vivid
green
of
the
oasis
to
the
purple
crags
in
dark
relief
against
a
sky
of
flame
all
things
have
been
new
two
sundays
witnessed
two
incidents
one
the
baptism
of
a
young
moslem
in
a
fashion
who
shortly
afterwards
renounced
christianity
and
the
other
that
of
a
respectable
mohammedan
merchant
in
isfahan
who
has
long
pleaded
for
baptism
presenting
himself
at
the
altar
rails
at
the
holy
communion
resolved
that
if
he
were
not
permitted
to
confess
christ
as
divine
in
one
way
he
would
in
another
he
was
passed
over
to
my
great
regret
if
he
be
sincere
but
i
suppose
the
rubric
leaves
no
choice
i
have
written
little
about
my
prospective
journey
because
there
has
been
a
prolonged
uncertainty
about
it
and
even
now
i
can
not
give
any
definite
account
of
the
project
except
that
the
route
lies
through
an
altogether
mountainous
region
in
that
part
of
the
province
of
luristan
known
in
persia
colloquially
as
the
bakhtiari
country
from
being
inhabited
by
the
bakhtiari
lurs
chiefly
nomads
the
pros
and
cons
as
to
my
going
have
been
innumerable
and
the
two
people
in
persia
who
know
the
earlier
part
of
the
route
say
that
the
character
of
the
people
makes
it
impossible
for
a
lady
to
travel
among
them
on
the
other
hand
i
have
the
consent
and
help
of
the
highest
authorities
persian
and
english
and
shall
not
go
too
far
but
shall
return
to
isfahan
in
case
things
should
turn
out
as
is
feared
the
exploration
of
a
previously
unexplored
region
will
be
in
itself
interesting
but
whether
there
will
be
sufficient
of
the
human
interests
which
i
chiefly
care
for
i
doubt
in
that
case
the
journey
will
be
dull
at
all
events
i
shall
probably
have
to
return
here
in
two
months
but
such
a
journey
for
myself
and
two
servants
in
such
a
region
requires
extensive
preparations
and
i
have
brought
all
my
own
travelling
dodges
into
requisition
with
a
selection
of
those
of
other
people
it
is
considered
desirable
to
carry
stores
from
isfahan
for
forty
days
except
flour
and
rice
which
can
be
obtained
a
week
march
from
here
at
the
british
legation
i
was
kindly
supplied
with
many
tins
of
preserved
meat
and
milk
and
jam
and
besides
these
i
am
only
taking
a
quantity
of
edwards
desiccated
soup
portable
and
excellent
twelve
pounds
of
tea
and
ten
pounds
of
candles
the
great
thing
in
planning
is
to
think
of
what
one
can
do
without
two
small
bottles
of
saccharin
supply
the
place
of
forty
pounds
of
sugar
two
contain
my
stores
cooking
and
table
utensils
and
personal
luggage
a
waterproof
bag
my
bedding
and
a
divided
now
empty
goes
for
the
flour
and
rice
everything
in
the
is
put
up
in
bags
made
of
the
coarse
cotton
of
the
country
the
tents
and
which
have
been
socketed
for
easier
transport
on
crooked
mountain
paths
and
a
made
from
a
kashmiri
pattern
in
tihran
are
all
packed
in
covers
made
from
the
gunny
bags
in
which
sugar
is
imported
and
so
are
double
sets
of
large
and
small
iron
presents
for
the
savages
are
also
essential
and
i
have
succeeded
in
getting
thimbles
many
gross
of
small
china
buttons
which
it
is
said
they
like
to
sew
on
children
caps
needles
a
quantity
of

and
many
other
things
i
take
three
tents
including
a
five
feet
square
and
only
weighing
ten
pounds
my
kit
is
reduced
to
very
simple
elements
a
kettle
two
copper
pots
which
fit
into
each
other
a
frying
pan
cooking
knife
and
spoon
a
tray
instead
of
a
table
a
chair
two
plates
a
teacup
and
saucer
a
soup
plate
mug
and
teapot
all
of
course
in
enamelled
iron
a
knife
fork
and
two
spoons
this
is
ample
for
one
person
for
any
length
of
time
in
camp
for
this
amount
of
baggage
and
for
the
sacks
of
flour
and
rice
weighing
which
will
hereafter
be
carried
i
have
four
mules
none
heavily
laden
and
two
with
such
light
loads
that
they
can
be
ridden
by
my
servants
these
mules
two
and
a
horse
are
engaged
for
the
journey
at
two
a
day
each
the
owner
stipulating
for
a
of
fifty
if
at
the
end
i
am
satisfied
this
sum
is
to
cover
food
and
all
risks
the
animals
are
hired
from
a
who
has
made
a
large
fortune
and
is
regarded
as
very
trustworthy
bruce
calls
him
the
prince
of
he
and
his
son
are
going
on
the
trip
he
has
a
quiet
superior
manner
and
when
he
came
to
judge
of
the
weight
of
my
loads
he
said
they
were
very
good
very
right
a
more
agreeable
verdict
than
muleteers
are
wont
to
pass
upon
baggage
the
making
of
the
contract
with
hadji
involved
two
important
processes
the
writing
of
it
by
a
scribe
and
the
sealing
of
it
the
scribe
is
one
of
the
most
important
persons
in
persia
every
great
man
has
one
or
more
and
every
little
man
has
occasion
for
a
services
in
the
course
of
a
year
he
is
the
trusted
depositary
of
an
infinity
of
secrets
he
moves
with
dignity
and
deliberation
his
writer
inkhorn
pendent
from
his
girdle
and
his
physiognomy
has
been
trained
to
that
reticent
expression
common
to
successful
solicitors
in
england
writing
is
a
fine
art
in
persia
the
characters
are
in
themselves
graceful
and
lend
themselves
readily
to
decoration
the
old
illuminated
mss
are
things
of
beauty
even
my
contract
is
ornamental
the
scribe
holds
the
paper
in
his
left
hand
and
uses
a
reed
pen
with
the
nib
cut
obliquely
writing
from
right
to
left
the
ink
is
thick
and
is
carried
with
the
pens
in
a
inkhorn
hadji
tells
me
with
much
pride
that
his
son
abbas
ali
can
write
and
will
be
very
useful
sealing
is
instead
of
signing
as
in
japan
every
adult
male
has
his
seal
of
agate
or
cornelian
among
the
rich
and
of
brass
or
silver
among
the
poor
the
name
is
carefully
engraved
on
the
seal
at
a
cost
of
from
a
to
a
letter
tihran
is
celebrated
for
its
no
document
is
authentic
without
a
seal
as
its
signature
hadji
took
the
contract
and
applied
it
to
his
forehead
in
token
of
respect
touched
the
paper
with
his
tongue
to
make
it
moist
and
receptive
waved
it
in
the
air
to
rid
it
of
superfluous
moisture
wetted
his
fingers
on
a
spongy
ball
of
silk
full
of
indian
ink
in
the
scribe
inkstand
rubbed
the
ink
on
the
seal
breathed
on
it
and
pressed
it
firmly
down
on
the
paper
which
he
held
over
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
the
smallest
acts
in
persia
are
regulated
by
rigid
custom
the
remaining
portion
of
my
outfit
but
not
the
least
important
consists
of
a
beautiful
medicine
chest
of
the
most
compact
and
portable
make
most
kindly
given
to
me
by
burroughes
and
wellcome
containing
fifty
small
bottles
of
their
invaluable
tabloids
a
hypodermic
syringe
and
surgical
instruments
for
simple
cases
to
these
i
have
added
a
quantity
of
quinine
and
odling
at
tihran
gave
me
some
valuable
remedies
a
quantity
of
bandages
lint
absorbent
cotton
completes
this
essential
equipment
among
the
many
uncertainties
of
the
future
this
appears
certain
that
the
bakhtiaris
will
be
clamorous
for
european
medicine
i
have
written
of
my
servants
mirza
yusuf
pleases
me
very
much
hassan
the
cook
seems
quiet
but
not
active
and
i
picture
to
myself
the
confusion
of
in
camp
with
two
men
who
know
nothing
about
camp
life
and
its
makeshifts
whatever
the
summer
brings
this
is
probably
my
last
letter
written
from
under
a
roof
till
next
winter
i
am
sorry
to
leave
julfa
and
these
kind
friends
but
the
prospect
of
the
unknown
has
its
charms
footnotes
never
became
a
friend
or
companion
scarcely
a
comrade
but
showed
plenty
of
pluck
and
endurance
climbed
and
descended
horrible
rock
ladders
over
which
a
horse
with
a
rider
had
never
passed
before
was
steady
in
fords
and
at
the
end
of
three
and
a
half
months
of
severe
travelling
and
occasional
scarcity
of
food
was
in
better
condition
than
when
he
left
julfa
he
has
since
been
baptized
but
for
safety
had
to
relinquish
his
business
and
go
to
india
where
he
is
supporting
himself
and
his
conduct
is
satisfactory
i
never
returned
and
only
at
the
end
of
three
and
a
half
months
emerged
from
the
bakhtiari
country
at
burujird
after
a
journey
of
miles
hadji
hussein
deserves
a
passing
recommendation
i
fear
that
he
is
still
increasing
his
fortune
and
has
not
retired
the
journey
was
a
very
severe
one
full
of
peril
to
his
mules
from
robbers
and
dangerous
roads
and
not
without
risk
to
himself
with
the
exception
of
a
few
orientalisms
which
are
hardly
worth
recalling
he
was
faithful
and
upright
made
no
attempt
to
overreach
kept
to
his
bargain
was
punctual
and
careful
and
at
burujird
we
parted
good
friends
he
was
always
most
respectful
to
me
and
i
owe
him
gratitude
for
many
kindnesses
which
increased
my
comfort
it
is
right
to
acknowledge
that
a
part
of
the
success
of
the
journey
was
owing
to
the
efficiency
of
the
transport
notes

the
bakhtiari
country
or
in
introducing
the
following
journal
of
a
summer
spent
in
or
greater
luristan
by
a
few
explanatory
notes
i
desire
to
acknowledge
the
labours
of
those
travellers
who
have
preceded
me
over
some
of
the
earlier
portions
of
the
route
and
my
obligations
to
those
careful
explorers
of
half
a
century
ago
who
turned
the
light
of
modern
research
upon
the
antiquities
of
lower
elam
and
the
condition
of
its
modern
inhabitants
and
whose
earnestness
and
accuracy
the
traveller
in
upper
elam
and
the
bakhtiari
country
may
well
desire
to
emulate
for
the
correction
of
those
portions
of
my
letters
which
attempt
to
describe
a
part
of
mountainous
luristan
previously
unexplored
i
am
deeply
indebted
to
a
recent
unpublished
geographical
report
to
which
any
geographical
interest
which
they
may
possess
is
altogether
due
for
the
customs
and
beliefs
of
the
bakhtiaris
i
have
had
to
depend
entirely
on
my
own
investigations
made
through
an
intelligent
and
faithful
interpreter
whose
desire
for
accuracy
was
scarcely
exceeded
by
my
own
the
accompanying
sketch

an
area
of
square

roughly

the

covers
a

of
about
miles
a
journey
of
three

a
half

in
the

of
the
upper

its
affluents
among
which
must
be

was
termed

an
important

long

deep
and
with
a
persistent
level
was
found
to
occupy
a
hollow
at
the
inner
foot
of
the
grand
mountain
shuturun
and
this
having
no
native

was
marked
on
the

as

the
bakhtiari
mountains
are
chains
of
precipitous
parallel
ranges
generally
running
and
the
valleys
which
divide
them
and
carry
off
their
waters
taking
the
same
directions
as
far
as
the
where
a
remarkable
change
takes
place
noticed
in
letter
xvii
this
great
mountain
region
lying
between
the
lofty
plateau
of
central
persia
and
the
plains
of
khuzistan
has
continuous
ranges
of
singular
steepness
but
rarely
broken
up
into
prominent
peaks
the
the
the
shuturun
kuh
and
dalonak
being
detached
mountains
the
great
ranges
of
the
the
the
sabz
kuh
the
kala
kuh
and
the
zard
kuh
were
crossed
and
recrossed
by
passes
from
to
feet
in
altitude
many
of
the
summits
were
ascended
and
the
deep
valleys
between
them
with
their
streams
were
followed
up
wherever
it
was
possible
to
do
so
the
magnificent
mountain
was
ascertained
to
be
not
only
a
notable
but
to
indicate
in
a
very
marked
manner
two
distinct
mountain
systems
with
remarkable
peculiarities
of
drainage
as
well
as
to
form
a
colossal
barrier
between
two
regions
which
for
the
sake
of
intelligible
description
were
called
upper
elam
and
the
bakhtiari
country
the
same
authority
for
the
same
purpose
designated
the
two
main
and
highest
chains
of
mountains
by
the
terms
outer
and
inner
ranges
the
former
being
the
one
nearest
the
great
persian
plateau
the
latter
the
chain
nearest
to
the
khuzistan
plains
the
conjectural
altitudes
of
the
peaks
in
this
hitherto
unexplored
region
have
been
brought
down
by
some
thousands
of
feet
and
the
eternal
snow
with
which
rumour
had
crested
them
has
turned
out
a
myth
the
altitude
of
the
highest
summit
being
estimated
at
only
a
trifle
over
feet
the
nearly
continuous
ranges
of
the
are
pierced
for
the
passage
of
water
by
a
few
remarkable
rifts
or
the
outer
range
by
the
the
outlet
of
the
zainderud
towards
isfahan
and
the
warkash
by
which
the
drainage
of
the
important
districts
of
the
chahar
mahals
passes
to
the
karun
the
inner
range
being
pierced
at
the
by
the
karun
itself
of
the
the
rivers
which
carry
the
drainage
of
certain
districts
of
persia
to
the
sea
pierce
the
main
mountain
ranges
at
right
angles
passing
through
magnificent
gorges
and
chasms
from
to
feet
in
depth
among
the
mountains
but
especially
in
the
formation
of
the
there
are
many
alpine
valleys
at
altitudes
of
from
to
feet
rich
summer
pastures
such
as
gurab
chigakhor
shorab
and
cheshmeh
zarin
some
of
the
valleys
are
of
considerable
width
many
only
afford
room
for
narrow
tracks
above
the
streams
by
which
they
are
usually
watered
while
others
are
mere
rifts
for
torrents
and
are
inaccessible
among
the
limestone
ranges
fountain
springs
are
of
frequent
occurrence
gushing
out
of
the
mountain
sides
with
great
volume
and
impetuosity
the
perennial
sources
of
perennial
streams
much
of
the
country
is
absolutely
without
wood
producing
nothing
fit
even
for
fuel
but
the
and
the
this
is
especially
the
case
on
the
outer
slopes
of
the
outer
range
which
are
formed
of
rocky
ribs
with
a
covering
of
gravel
and
are
barren
treeless
waterless
and
grassless
from
the
same
crest
to
the
outer
slopes
of
the
inner
range
which
descend
on
khuzistan
there
are
splendid
pasturage
abundant
water
and
extensive
forests
in
the
deep
valleys
and
on
the
hill
slopes
the
trees
however
can
rarely
be
defined
as
forest
trees
they
are
small
in
girth
and
are
usually
stunted
and
wizened
in
aspect
as
if
the
conditions
of
their
existence
were
not
kindly
flowers
are
innumerable
in
the
months
of
may
and
june
beginning
with
the
tulip
the
iris
the
narcissus
and
a
small
purple
gladiolus
and
a
little
later
many
of
the
hillsides
above
an
altitude
of
feet
are
aflame
with
a
crimson
and
and
a
anemone
while
the
margins
of
the
are
gay
with
pink
patches
of
an
exquisite
alpine
primula
chicory
the
dark
blue
centaurea
a
large
orange
and
yellow
snapdragon
and
the
scarlet
poppy
attend
upon
grain
crops
there
as
elsewhere
and
the
slopes
above
the
upper
karun
are
brilliant
with
pink
mauve
and
white
hollyhocks
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
chief
interest
of
many
of
the
flowers
is
botanical
only
they
are
leathery
woolly
thorny
and
sticky
adapted
rather
for
arid
circumstances
than
to
rejoice
the
eye
among
the
economic
plants
observed
were
the
which
grows
in
singular
abundance
at
a
height
of
from
to
feet
and
is
cut
and
stacked
for
fodder
a
species
of
celery
of
very
strong
flavour
which
is
an
important
article
of
food
for
man
and
beast
and
the
of
which
six
feet
high
are
woven
into
booths
by
some
of
the
tribes
the
blue
linum
red
madder
the
which
is
cut
and
stacked
for
fodder
a
purple
garlic
the
bulbs
of
which
are
eaten
liquorice
and
the
in
small
quantities
it
is
a
surprise
to
the
traveller
to
find
that
a
large
area
is
under
cultivation
and
that
the
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
are
clean
and
up
to
the
persian
average
and
that
the
removal
of
stones
and
a
laborious
irrigation
system
are
the
work
of
nomads
who
only
occupy
their
for
five
months
of
the
year
it
may
be
said
that
nearly
every
valley
and
where
water
is
procurable
is
turned
to
account
for
grain
crops
no
part
of
the
world
in
this
latitude
is
fuller
of
streams
and
torrents
but
three
only
attain
to
any
geographical
dignity
the
zainderud
or
river
of
isfahan
which
after
a
course
full
of
promise
loses
itself
ignominiously
in
a
swamp
the
karun
with
its
bakhtiari
tributaries
of
the
the
darkash
warkash
the
and
the
dinarud
and
the
which
has
an
important
course
of
its
own
before
its
junction
with
the
karun
at
bandakir
none
of
these
rivers
are
navigable
during
their
course
through
the
bakhtiari
mountains
they
are
occasionally
spanned
by
bridges
of
stone
or
wickerwork
or
of
yet
simpler
construction
with
the
exception
of
the
small
area
of
the
outer
range
which
contains
the
of
the
zainderud
the
bakhtiari
country
proper
consists
of
the
valleys
of
the
upper
karun
and
its
tributaries
the
tracks
naturally
follow
the
valleys
and
are
fairly
easy
in
their
gradients
to
the
of
the
to
the
however
being
compelled
to
cross
rivers
which
pierce
the
ranges
at
right
angles
to
their
directions
ascents
and
descents
of
several
thousand
feet
are
involved
at
short
intervals
formed
of
rock
ladders
which
may
be
regarded
as
impassable
for
laden
animals
the
roads
are
nothing
better
than
tracks
worn
in
the
course
of
centuries
by
the
annual
passage
of
the
nomads
and
their
flocks
to
and
from
their
summer
pastures
in
addition
to
the
tracks
which
follow
the
lie
of
the
valleys
footpaths
cross
the
main
ranges
where
foothold
can
be
obtained
there
are
but
two
bridle
tracks
which
deserve
mention
as
being
possible
for
caravan
traffic
between
isfahan
and
shuster
one
crossing
the
at
a
height
of
feet
and
the
karun
at
dupulan
the
other
which
considerably
diminishes
the
distance
between
the
two
commercial
points
crossing
the
zard
kuh
by
the
cherri
pass
at
an
altitude
of
feet
and
dropping
down
a
steep
descent
of
over
feet
to
the
bazuft
river
these
the
gurab
and
the
and
pambakal
passes
which
cross
the
zard
kuh
range
at
elevations
of
over
feet
are
reported
as
closed
by
snow
for
several
months
in
winter
in
view
of
the
from
ahwaz
to
tihran
which
will
pass
through
the
gap
of
khuramabad
the
possible
importance
of
any
one
of
these
routes
fades
completely
away
the
climate
though
one
of
extremes
is
healthy
maladies
of
locality
are
unknown
the
water
is
usually
pure
and
malarious
swamps
do
not
exist
salt
springs
produce
a
sufficiency
of
salt
for
wholesome
use
and
medicinal
plants
abound
the
heat
begins
in
early
june
and
is
steady
till
the
end
of
august
the
mercury
rising
to
in
the
shade
at
altitudes
of
feet
but
it
is
rarely
oppressive
the
nights
are
cool
and
greenery
and
abounding
waters
are
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
arid
hills
and
burning
plains
of
persia
the
rainfall
is
scarcely
measurable
the
snowfall
is
reported
as
heavy
and
the
winter
temperatures
are
presumably
low
there
are
few
traces
of
a
past
history
and
the
legends
connected
with
the
few
are
too
hazy
to
be
of
any
value
but
there
are
remains
of
bridges
of
dressed
stone
and
of
at
least
one
ancient
road
which
must
have
been
trodden
by
the
soldiers
of
alexander
the
great
and
valerian
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
rude
forts
here
and
there
which
the
tribesmen
attribute
to
mythical
heroes
of
their
own
race
may
have
been
built
to
guard
greek
or
roman
communications
the
geology
entomology
and
zoology
of
the
bakhtiari
country
have
yet
to
be
investigated
in
a
journey
of
three
months
and
a
half
the
only
animals
seen
were
a
bear
and
cubs
a
boar
some
small
ibex
a
blue
hare
and
some
jackals
francolin
are
common
and
storks
were
seen
but
scarcely
any
other
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
are
rare
it
is
the
noxious
forms
of
animated
life
which
are
abundant
there
are
snakes
some
of
them
venomous
a
venomous
spider
and
a
stinging
beetle
and
legions
of
black
flies
mosquitos
and
infest
many
localities
this
area
of
lofty
ranges
valleys
gorges
and
alpine
pasturages
is
inhabited
by
the
bakhtiari
lurs
classed
with
the
savage
or
races
who
though
they
descend
to
the
warmer
plains
in
the
winter
invariably
speak
of
these
mountains
as
their
country
on
this
journey
nearly
all
the
tribes
were
visited
in
their
own
encampments
and
their
arrangements
modes
of
living
customs
and
beliefs
were
subjects
of
daily
investigation
the
results
of
which
are
given
in
the
letters
which
follow
their
own
very
hazy
traditions
which
are
swift
to
lose
themselves
in
the
fabulous
represent
that
they
came
from
syria
under
one
chief
and
took
possession
of
the
country
which
they
now
inhabit
a
later
tradition
states
that
a
descendant
of
this
chief
had
two
wives
equally
beloved
one
of
whom
had
four
sons
and
the
other
seven
and
that
after
their
father
death
the
young
men
quarrelled
separated
and
bequeathed
their
quarrel
to
posterity
the
seven
brothers
forming
the
haft
lang
division
of
the
bakhtiaris
and
the
four
the
chahar
lang
the
haft
lang
though
originally
far
superior
in
numbers
weakened
their
power
by
their
unending
internal
conflicts
and
in
when
sir
layard
visited
a
part
of
luristan
not
embraced
in
this
route
and
sojourned
at
the
power
and
headship
of
mehemet
taki
khan
the
great
chief
of
their
rivals
the
chahar
lang
were
recognised
throughout
the
region
the
misfortunes
which
came
upon
him
overthrew
the
supremacy
of
his
clan
and
now
as
for
some
years
past
the
haft
lang
supply
the
ruling
dynasty
the
chahar
lang
being
however
still
strong
enough
to
decide
any
battles
for
the
chieftainship
which
may
be
fought
among
their
rivals
time
and
a
stronger
assertion
of
the
sovereignty
of
persia
have
toned
the
feud
down
into
a
general
enmity
and
aversion
but
the
tribes
of
the
two
septs
rarely
intermarry
and
seldom
encamp
near
each
other
without
bloodshed
the
great
divisions
of
the
bakhtiaris
the
haft
lang
the
chahar
lang
and
the
dinarunis
with
the
dependencies
of
the
janiki
garmsir
the
janiki
sardsir
and
the
afshar
tribe
of
gunduzlu
remain
as
they
were
half
a
century
ago
when
they
were
the
subject
of
careful
investigation
by
sir
layard
and
sir
rawlinson
the
tribes
as
enumerated
by
several
of
the
khans
without
any
divergence
in
their
statements
number
families
an
increase
in
the
last
taking
eight
to
a
household
which
i
believe
to
be
a
fair
estimate
a
population
of
would
be
the
result
a
few
small
villages
of
mud
hovels
at
low
altitudes
are
tenanted
by
a
part
of
their

people
they
have
as
has
been
referred
to
previously
of
late
years
irrigated
stoned
and
cultivated
a
number
of
their
valleys
sowing
in
the
early
autumn
leaving
the

for
the

and
early

and
on
their
return
weeding

in

they
are
fanatical
moslems
of

shiah
sect
but
combine
relics
of

with
the
tenets
of

the

were

a

united
under
the
judicious
and
ambitious
policy
of

nominally
acknowledge
one
feudal
head
the

who
is

with

called
the

the
ilkhani
who
is
appointed
by
the
shah
for
a
given
period
capable
of
indefinite
extension
is
responsible
for
the
tribute
which
amounts
to
about

possibly
in

from

might
take
the
field
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
more
than
from
to
could
be
relied
on
in
an
external
quarrel
the
khan
of
each
tribe
is
practically
its
despotic
ruler
and
every
tribesman
is
bound
to
hold
himself
at
his
disposal
as
concerns
tribute
they
are
under
the
government
of
isfahan
with
the
exception
of
three
tribes
and
a
half
which
are
under
the
government
of
burujird
they
are
a
warlike
people
and
though
more
peaceable
than
formerly
they
cherish
and
are
always
fighting
among
themselves
their
habits
are
predatory
by
inclination
and
tradition
but
they
have
certain
notions
of
honour
and
of
regard
to
pledges
when
voluntarily
given
they
deny
persian
origin
but
speak
a
dialect
of
persian
conquered
by
nadir
shah
who
took
many
of
them
into
his
service
they
became
independent
after
his
death
until
the
reign
of
mohammed
shah
though
tributary
they
still
possess
a
sort
of
independence
though
persia
of
late
years
has
tightened
her
grip
upon
them
and
the
shah
keeps
many
of
their
influential
families
in
tihran
and
its
neighbourhood
as
hostages
for
the
good
behaviour
of
their
clans
of
the
feili
lurs
the
nomads
of
or
the
lesser
luristan
the
region
lying
between
the
and
the
assyrian
plains
with
the
province
of
kirmanshah
to
the
north
and
susiana
to
the
south
little
was
seen
these
tribes
are
numerically
superior
to
the
bakhtiaris
fifty
years
ago
according
to
sir
rawlinson
they
numbered
families
they
have
no
single
feudal
chieftain
like
their
neighbours
nor
are
their
subdivisions
ruled
as
among
them
by
powerful
khans
they
are
governed
by
lit
master
of
a
house
and
four
or
five
of
these
are
associated
in
the
rule
of
every
tribal
subdivision
on
such
occasions
as
involve
tribal
or
the
reverse
these
consult
as
equals
sir
rawlinson
considered
that
the
feili
lur
form
of
government
is
very
rare
among
the
clan
nations
of
asia
and
that
it
approaches
tolerably
near
to
the
spirit
of
a
confederated
republic
their
language
according
to
the
same
authority
differs
little
from
that
of
the
kurds
of
kirmanshah
unlike
the
bakhtiaris
they
neglect
agriculture
but
they
breed
and
export
mules
and
trade
in
carpets
charcoal
and
sheep
in
faith
they
are
ali
ilahis
but
are
grossly
ignorant
and
religiously
indifferent
they
show
scarcely
any
respect
to
mohammed
and
the
koran
and
combine
a
number
of
ancient
superstitions
and
curious
sacrificial
rites
with
a
deep
reverence
for
sultan
ibrahim
who
under
the
name
of
b
the
great
father
is
worshipped
throughout
for
the
tribute
payable
to
persia
no
single
individual
is
responsible
the
sum
to
be
levied
is
distributed
among
the
tribes
by
a
general
council
after
which
each
subdivision
apportions
the
amount
to
be
paid
by
the
different
camps
and
the
lit
or
head
of
each
encampment
collects
from
the
different
families
according
to
their
means
the
task
of
the
persian
is
a
difficult
one
for
the
tribes
are
in
a
state
of
chronic
turbulence
and
fail
even
in
obedience
to
their
own
general
council
and
the
collection
frequently
ends
in
an
incursion
of
persian
soldiers
and
a
government
raid
on
the
flocks
and
herds
many
of
these
people
are
miserably
poor
and
they
are
annually
growing
poorer
under
persian
maladministration
the
feili
lurs
are
important
to
england
commercially
because
the
from
ahwaz
to
tihran
to
be
completed
within
two
years
passes
partly
through
their
country
and
its
success
as
the
future
trade
route
from
the
gulf
depends
upon
their
or
rather
upon
their
successful
coercion
by
the
persian

sir
rawlinson
sums
up
bakhtiari
character
in
these
very
severe
words
i
believe
them
to
be
individually
brave
but
of
a
cruel
and
savage
character
they
pursue
their
with
the
most
inveterate
and
exterminating
spirit
and
they
consider
no
oath
or
obligation
in
any
way
binding
when
it
interferes
with
their
thirst
for
revenge
indeed
the
dreadful
stories
of
domestic
tragedy
that
are
related
in
which
whole
families
have
fallen
by
each
other
hands
a
son
for

having
slain
his
father
to
obtain
the
chiefship
another

having
avenged
the
murder
and
so
on
till
only
one
individual
was
left
are
enough
to
freeze
the
blood
with
horror
it
is
proverbial
in
persia
that
the
bakhtiaris
have
been
obliged
to
forego
altogether
the
reading
of
the
or
prayer
for
the
dead
for
otherwise
they
would
have
no

they

there
is
an
improvement
since
this

was
pronounced
at

i
am
inclined
to
take
a
much
more
favourable
view
of
the
bakhtiaris
than
has
been
given
in
the
very
interesting
paper
from

this

in

contains
the
following
remarks
on
this
route
as
to
the
danger
to
caravans
in
passing
through
these
hills
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
lurs
are
now
content
to
abandon
robbery
with
violence
in
favour
of
payments
and
contributions
from
timid
traders
and
travellers
they
hang
upon
the
rear
of
a
caravan
an
accident
a
fallen
or
strayed
pack
animal
or
stragglers
in
difficulty
bring
them
to
the
spot
and
on
the
pretence
of
assistance
given
a
demand
is
made
for
money
in
lieu
of
which
on
fear
or
hesitation
being
shown
they
obtain
such
articles
as
they
take
a
fancy
to
the
tribes
through
whose
limits
the
road
runs
have
annual
allowances
for
protecting
it
but
it
is
a
question
whether
these
are
regularly
paid
it
can
hardly
be
expected
that
the
same
system
of
deferred
and
reduced
payments
which
unfortunately
prevails
in
the
persian
public
service
should
be
accepted
patiently
by
a
starving
people
who
have
long
been
given
to
predatory
habits
and
this
may
account
for
occasional
disturbance
they
probably
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
payment
of
taxes
should
be
mercilessly
exacted
upon
them
while
their
allowances
remain
unpaid
it
is
generally
believed
that
they
would
take
readily
to
work
if
fairly
treated
and
honestly
paid

i
was
told
that
for
the
construction
of

exchanged

these
are
numerous
both
near

are
everywhere
far
more
imposing
than
the

of

made
a
complete
end

for
the
time
the

has
never
assumed
its

near
julfa
many
of

are
falling

the

towers
however
are
in
good
repair
they
are
all
built
in
the

way
varying
only
in
size
and
height
from
twenty
to
fifty
feet
in
diameter
and
from
to
eighty
feet
from

of
bricks
of

costing
about
two

that
fly
as

as
the

probably
referred

the
object
of

the
preservation

a
cessation
of
the
great
demand
for
early
melons
in
the
neighbourhood
of
isfahan
has
prevented
the
of
the
towers
since
the

our
experiences
of
riz
were
not
pleasant
one
of
the
party
during
a
short
absence
from
his
tent
was
robbed
of
a
very
valuable
scientific
instrument
after
that
there
was
the
shuffling
sound
of
a
multitude
outside
the
tent
in
which
miss
bruce

i
were
resting
and
women
concealed
from
head
to
foot
in
blue
and
white

kept
lifting
the

was
laced
applying
the
one
eye
to
the
spaces
between
the
whispering
and
tittering
all
the

hot
though
it
was
their
persevering
curiosity
prevented
any
ventilation
and
the
steady
gaze
of
single
eyes
here
there
and
everywhere
was
most
exasperating
it
was
impossible
to
use
the
dressing
tent
for
crowds
of
boys
assembled
and
rows
of
open
mouths
and
staring
eyes
appeared
between
the
and
the
ground
vainly
miss
bruce
who
speaks
persian
well
and
courteously
told
the
women
that
this
intrusion
on

privacy
when
we
were
very
tired
was
both
rude
and
unkind

never
seen
so
many
europeans
before
sunset
ended
the
nuisance
for
then
the
whole
crowd
having
fasted
since
sunrise
hurried
home
for
food
the
great
fast
of
the
month
of
ramazan
began
before
we
left
julfa
moslems
are
not
at
their
best
while
it
lasts
they
are
apt
to
be
crabbed
and
irritable
and
everything
that
can
be
postponed
is
put
off
till
after
ramazan
much
ostentation
comes
out
in
the
keeping
of
it
very
pious
people
begin
to
fast
before
the
month
sets
in
a
really
ascetic
moslem
does
not
even
swallow
his
saliva
during
the
fast
and
none
but
very
old
or
sick
people
children
and
travellers
are
exempt
from
the
obligation
to
taste
neither
food
nor
water
and
not
even
to
smoke
during
daylight
for
a
whole
month
the
penance
is
a
fearful
one
and
as
the
night
is
the
only
time
for
feasting
the
persians
get
through
as
much
of
the
day
as
possible
in
sleep
welcome
indeed
is
the
sunset
with
joy
men
fill
their
pipes
and
drink
tea
as
a
prelude
to
the
meal
eaten
an
hour
afterwards
hateful
is
the
dawn
and
the
cry
an
hour
before
it
water
oh
water
and
opium
the
warning
to
the
faithful
to
drink
largely
and
swallow
an
opium
pill
before
sunrise
the
thirst
even
in
weather
like
this
and
the
abstention
from
smoking
are
severer
trials
than
the
fasting
from
food
the
persian
either
lives
to
smoke
or
smokes
to
live
although
travellers
are
nominally
exempt
from
the
fast
from
water
at
least
pious
moslems
do
not
avail
themselves
of
the
liberty
hadji
hussein
for
instance
is
keeping
it
as
rigidly
as
any
one
and
like
some
others
marches
with
the
end
of
his
tucked
over
his
mouth
and
nose
a
religious
affectation
supposed
to
prevent
the
breaking
of
the
fast
by
swallowing
the
animalcul√¶
which
are
believed
to
infest
the
air
beyond
riz
everywhere
there
are
arid
yellow
mountains
and
yellow
gravelly
plains
except
along
the
zainderud
where
wheat
and
the
opium
poppy
relieve
the
eyes
from
the
glare
we
took
leave
of
the
zainderud
at
where
it
is
crossed
by
a
dilapidated
but
passable
and
very
picturesque
stone
bridge
of
eight
arches
and
the
view
from
the
high
right
bank
of
wood
bridge
and
the
vigorous
green
river
is
very
pretty
little
enough
of
trees
or
greenery
have
we
seen
since
this
country
like
much
of
the
great
iranian
plateau
consists
of
high
mountains
with
broad
valleys
or
large
or
small
plateaux
between
them
absolutely
treeless
and
even
now
nearly
verdureless
with
scattered
oases
wherever
a
possibility
of
procuring
water
by
means
of
irrigation
canals
renders
cultivation
possible
water
is
scarce
and
precious
its
value
may
be
gathered
from
the
allusions
made
by
the
persian
poets
to
fountains
cascades
shady
pools
running
streams
and
bubbling
springs
such
expressions
as
those
in
scripture
rivers
of
waters
a
spring
of
water
whose
waters
fail
not
convey
a
fulness
of
meaning
to
persian
ears
of
which
we
are
quite
ignorant
the
first
inquiry
of
a
persian
about
any
part
of
his
own
country
is
is
there
water
the
second
is
the
water
good
and
if
he
wishes
to
extol
any
particular
region
he
says
the
water
is
abundant
all
the
year
and
is
sweet
there
is
no
such
water
anywhere
the
position
of
a
village
is
always
determined
by
the
water
supply
for
the
people
have
not
only
to
think
of
water
for
domestic
purposes
but
for
irrigating
their
crops
and
this
accounts
for
the
packing
of
hamlets
on
steep
mountain
sides
where
land
for
cultivation
can
only
be
obtained
by
laborious
terracing
but
where
some
perennial
stream
can
be
relied
on
for
filling
the
small
canals
the
fight
for
water
is
one
of
the
hardest
necessities
of
the
persian
peasant
a
water
famine
of
greater
or
less
degree
is
a
constant
peril
land
in
persia
is
of
three
grades
the
wholly
irrigated
the
partially
irrigated
and
the
usually
uplands
chiefly
suited
for
pasturage
the
wholly
irrigated
land
is
the
most
productive
the
assessments
for
taxes
appear
to
leave
altogether
out
of
account
the
relative
fertility
of
the
land
and
to
be
calculated
solely
on
the
supply
of
water
a
winter
like
the
last
of
heavy
snow
means
a
plenteous
harvest
twelve
or
fourteen
grains
for
one
as
the
peasants
put
it
a
scanty
snowfall
means
famine
for
the
little
rain
which
falls
is
practically
of
scarcely
any
use
the
plan
for
the
distribution
of
water
seems
to
be
far
less
provocative
of
quarrels
than
that
of
some
other
regions
dependent
on
irrigation
such
as
ladak
and
nubra
where
it
is
at
all
abundant
as
it
is
in
this
zainderud
valley
it
is
only
in
the
great
heats
of
summer
that
it
is
necessary
to
apportion
it
with
any
rigidity
it
is
then
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
or
water
officer
who
allows
it
to
each
village
in
turn
for
so
many
days
during
which
time
the
villages
above
get
none
or
the
manage
it
among
themselves
without
the
aid
of
a
for
the
sad
truth
which
is
applicable
to
all
persian
officialism
applies
in
the
case
that
if
a
village
be
rich
enough
to
bribe
him
it
can
get
water
out
of
its
turn
the
blessedness
of
the
zainderud
valley
is
exceptional
and
the
general
rule
in
the
majority
of
districts
is
that
the
water
must
be
carefully
divided
and
be
measured
by
each
being
equivalent
to
the
use
of
the
water
supply
for
eleven
minutes
this
space
of
time
is
estimated
in
a
very
ancient
fashion
by
floating
a
copper
bowl
with
a
needle
hole
in
the
bottom
in
a
large
vessel
of
water
the
comes
to
an
end
as
the
bowl
sinks
the
distribution
is
regulated
by
the
number
of
that
each
man
has
a
right
to
if
he
has
a
right
to
twenty
he
will
receive
water
for
three
and
hours
of
the
day
or
night
every
tenth
day
land
without
water
in
persia
is
about
as
valuable
as
the
south
lands
were
which
were
given
to
caleb
daughter
so
far
as
i
can
learn
the
persian
peasant
enjoys
a
tolerable
security
of
tenure
so
long
as
he
pays
his
rent
a
common
rate
of
rent
is
of
the
produce
but
on
lands
where
the
snow
lies
for
many
months
even
when
they
are
wet
lands
it
is
only
but
this
system
is
subject
to
many
modifications
specially
arising
out
of
the
finding
or
of
the
seed
by
the
owner
and
there
is
no
uniformity
in
the
manner
of
holding
land
or
in
assessing
the
taxes
or
in
anything
else
though
the
system
established
years
ago
is
still
the
basis
of
the
whole
the
line
between
the
oasis
and
the
desert
is
always
strongly
marked
and
definite
there
is
no
shading
away
between
the
deep
green
of
the
growing
wheat
and
the
yellow
or
red
gravel
beyond
the
general
impression
is
one
of
complete
nakedness
the
flowers
which
in
this
month
bloom
on
the
slopes
are
mostly
stiff
leathery
and
thorny
the
mountains
themselves
viewed
from
below
are
without
any
indication
of
green
the
usual
colouring
is
or
a
feeble
red
intensifying
at
sunset
but
rarely
glorified
owing
to
the
absence
of
atmosphere
it
is
a
very
solitary
route
from
without
villages
and
we
met
neither
caravans
nor
foot
passengers
the
others
rode
on
and
i
followed
with
two
of
the
bakhtiari
escort
who
with
rustem
khan
a
minor
chief
had
accompanied
us
from
julfa
these
men
were
most
inconsequent
in
their
proceedings
wheeling
round
me
at
a
gallop
singing
or
rather
howling
firing
their
long
guns
throwing
themselves
into
one
stirrup
and
nearly
off
their
horses
and
one
who
rides
without
a
bridle
came
up
behind
me
with
his
horse
bolting
and
nearly
knocked
me
out
of
the
saddle
with
the
long
barrel
of
his
gun
when
the
village
of
charmi
came
in
sight
i
signed
to
them
to
go
on
and
we
all
rode
at
a
gallop
the
horsemen
uttering
wild
cries
and
going
through
the
pantomime
of
firing
over
the
left
shoulders
and
right
flanks
of
their
horses
the
camps
were
pitched
on
what
might
be
called
the
village
green
charmi
like
many
persian
villages
is
walled
the
wall
which
is
much
jagged
by
rain
and
frost
having
round
towers
at
intervals
and
a
large
gateway
such
walls
are
no
real
protection
but
serve
to
keep
the
flocks
and
herds
from
nocturnal
depredators
within
the
gate
is
a
house
called
the
fort
with
a
very
fine
room
fully
thirty
feet
long
by
fifteen
high
decorated
with
a
mingled
splendour
and
simplicity
surprising
in
a
rural
district
the
wall
next
the
courtyard
is
entirely
of
very
beautiful
fretwork
filled
in
with
amber
and
pale
blue
glass
the
six
doors
are
the
same
and
the
walls
and
the
elaborate
roof
and
cornices
are
pure
white
the
projections
being
picked
out
in
a
pale
shade
of
brown
hardly
darker
than
amber
the
following
morning
miss
bruce
left
on
her
return
home
and
douglas
and
i
rode
fourteen
miles
to
the
large
village
of
kahva
rukh
where
we
parted
company
it
is
an
uninteresting
march
over
formless
gravelly
hills
and
small
plains
thinly
grassed
until
the
one
of
the
high
passes
on
the
isfahan
and
shuster
route
is
reached
with
its
extensive
view
of
brown
mountains
and
yellow
wastes
this
pass
feet
in
altitude
crossing
the
unshapely
is
the
watershed
of
the
country
all
the
streams
on
its
southern
side
falling
into
the
karun
it
is
also
the
entrance
to
the
chahar
mahals
or
four
districts
lar
khya
mizak
and
gandaman
which
consist
chiefly
of
great
plains
surrounded
by
mountains
and
somewhat
broken
up
by
their
gravelly
spurs
beyond
and
usually
in
sight
is
the
range
which
runs
and
throws
out
a
spur
to
chigakhor
the
summer
resort
of
the
bakhtiari
chiefs
the
chahar
mahals
for
persia
are
populous
and
in
some
parts
large
villages
many
of
which
are
armenian
and
georgian
occur
at
frequent
intervals
most
of
them
treeless
but
all
surrounded
by
cultivated
lands
the
armenian
villages
possess
relics
and
ancient
copies
of
the
gospels
which
are
credited
with
the
power
of
working
miracles
the
chahar
mahals
have
been
farmed
to
the
ilkhani
of
the
bakhtiaris
for
about
a
year
and
his
brother
reza
kuli
khan
has
been
appointed
their
governor
thus
on
crossing
the
kahva
rukh
pass
we
entered
upon
the
sway
of
the
feudal
head
of
the
great
bakhtiari
tribes
we
camped
outside
the
village
my
tents
being
pitched
in
a
ruinous
enclosure
the
servants
are
in
the
habit
of
calling
me
the
and
the
report
of
a
frank
having
arrived
soon
brought
a
crowd
of
sick
people
who
were
introduced
and
their
ailments
described
by
a
blue
horseman
one
of
the
escort
his
own
child
was
so
dangerously
ill
of
pneumonia
that
i
went
with
him
to
his
house
put
on
a
mustard
poultice
and
administered
some
powder
the
house
was
crammed
and
the
little
suffering
creature
had
hardly
air
to
breathe
the
courtyard
was
also
crowded
so
that
one
could
scarcely
move
all
the
people
being
quite
pleasant
and
friendly
i
saw
several
sick
people
and
was
surprised
to
find
the
village
houses
so
roomy
and
comfortable
and
so
full
of
plenishings
it
was
in
vain
that
i
explained
to
them
that
i
am
not
a
doctor
scarcely
even
a
nurse
the
fame
of
burroughes
and
wellcome
medicine
chest
has
spread
far
and
wide
and
they
think
its
possessor
be
a
the
horseman
said
that
medicine
out
of
that
chest
would
certainly
cure
his
child
i
was
unable
to
go
back
to
the
tea
which
had
been
prepared
in
the
horseman
house
on
which
he
expressed
great
dismay
and
said
i
must
be
enraged
with
him
persians
always
use
round
numbers
and
the
says
that
the
village
has
persian
houses
and
more
inhabited
during
the
winter
by
ilyats
it
has
mud
walls
with
towers
at
intervals
two
mosques
a
clear
stream
of
water
in
the
principal
street
some
very
good
houses
with
and
narrow
alleys
between
high
mud
walls
in
which
are
entrances
into
courtyards
occupied
by
animals
and
surrounded
by
the
only
trees
are
a
few
spindly
willows
but
wheat
comes
up
to
the
walls
and
at
sunset
great
herds
of
cattle
and
myriads
of
brown
sheep
converge
to
what
seems
quite
a
prosperous
village
yesterday
sunday
was
intended
to
be
a
day
of
rest
but
turned
out
very
far
from
it
after
the
last
relay
of
patients
left
on
saturday
evening
and
the
last
medicines
had
been
dispensed
my
tent
was
neatly
arranged
with
one
for
a
table
and
the
other
for
a
washstand
and
medicine
stand
the
latter
trunk
contained
some
english
gold
in
a
case
along
with
some
valuable
letters
and
some
bags
in
which
were
for
four
months
travelling
this
was
padlocked
it
was
a
full
moon
the
other
camps
were
quite
near
all
looked
very
safe
and
i
slept
until
awakened
by
the
sharpness
of
the
morning
air
then
i
saw
but
one
where
there
had
been
two
opening
the
tent
curtain
i
found
my
washing
apparatus
and
medicine
bottles
neatly
arranged
on
the
ground
outside
and
the
trunk
without
its
padlock
among
some
ruins
a
short
distance
off
the
money
bags
were
all
gone
leaving
me
literally
penniless
most
of
my
store
of
tea
was
taken
but
nothing
else
two
men
must
have
entered
my
tent
and
have
carried
the
trunk
out
of
what
use
are
any
precautions
when
one
sleeps
so
disgracefully
soundly
when
the
robbery
was
made
known
horsemen
were
sent
off
to
the
ilkhani
whose
guest
i
have
been
since
i
entered
his
territory
and
at
night
a
khan
arrived
with
a
message
that
the
money
would
be
repaid
and
that
the
village
would
be
levelled
with
the
ground
kahva
rukh
will
i
hope
stand
for
many
years
to
come
but
the
stolen
sum
will
be
levied
upon
it
according
to
custom
the
people
are
extremely
vexed
at
this
occurrence
and
i
would
rather
have
lost
half
the
sum
than
that
it
should
have
happened
to
a
guest
in
addition
to
an
escort
of
a
khan
and
four
men
the
ilkhani
has
given
orders
that
we
are
not
to
be
allowed
to
pay
for
anything
while
in
the
country
this
order
after
several
battles
i
successfully
disobey
this
morning
before
any
steps
were
taken
to
find
the
thief
and
after
all
the
loads
were
ready
officials
came
to
the
camps
and
by
our
wish
every
man
baggage
was
unrolled
and
searched
our
servants
and
are
all
moslems
and
each
of
them
took
an
oath
on
the
koran
administered
by
a
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
theft
may
i
left
rather
late
and
with
the
blue
horseman
to
whom
suspicion
generally
pointed
rode
to
shamsabad
partly
over
gravelly
wastes
passing
two
mixed
moslem
and
armenian
villages
on
a
plain
on
which
ninety
ploughs
were
at
work
on
a
stiff
whitish
soil
shamsabad
is
a
most
wretched
mud
village
without
supplies
standing
bare
on
a
gravelly
slope
above
a
clear
quiet
stream
an
affluent
of
the
karun
this
country
has
not
reached
that
stage
of
civilisation
in
which
a
river
bears
the
same
name
from
mouth
to
source
and
as
these
streams
usually
take
as
many
names
as
there
are
villages
on
their
course
i
do
not
burden
my
memory
with
them
there
is
a
charming
of
level
velvety
green
sward
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
with
the
towering
mass
of
jehanbin
sight
of
the
world
feet
high
not
far
off
this
lawn
is
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
air
keen
and
pleasant
the
near
mountain
views
are
grand
and
that
evening
the
rare
glory
of
a
fine
sunset
lingered
till
it
was
merged
in
the
beauty
of
a
perfect
moonlight
after
leaving
shamsabad
the
road
passes
through
a
rather
fine
defile
crosses
the
shamsabad
stream
by
a
bridge
between
the
and
the
and
proceeds
down
a
narrow
valley
now
full
of
wild
flowers
and
young
wheat
to
khariji
a
village
of
fifty
houses
famous
for
the
excellent
quality
of
its
opium
from
khariji
we
proceeded
through
low
grassy
hills
much
like
the
south
downs
and
over
the
low
but
very
rough
pasbandi
pass
into
an
irrigated
valley
in
which
is
the
village
of
shalamzar
i
rode
through
it
alone
quite
unmolested
but
two
days
later
the
sahib
passing
through
it
with
his
servants
was
insulted
and
pelted
and
the
people
said
here
another
of
the
dog
party
these
villagers
are
afflicted
with
divers
diseases
and
torments
and
the
crowd
round
my
tent
was
unusually
large
and
importunate
in
this
village
of
less
than
fifty
houses
nearly
all
the
people
had
one
or
both
eyes
more
or
less
affected
and
fourteen
had
only
one
eye
between
shalamzar
and
ardal
lies
the
lofty
by
which
the
is
crossed
at
a
height
of
feet
the
ascent
begins
soon
after
leaving
the
village
and
is
long
and
steep
a
nasty
climb
the
upper
part
at
this
date
is
encumbered
with
snow
below
which
primulas
are
blooming
in
great
profusion
and
lower
down
leathery
flowers
devoid
of
beauty
cover
without
adorning
the
hillside
two
peasants
went
up
with
me
and
from
time
to
time
kindly
handed
me
clusters
of
small
raisins
taken
from
the
breasts
of
dirty
felt
clothing
on
reaching
the
snow
i
found
rustem
khan
horse
in
a
drift
so
i
made
the
rest
of
the
ascent
on
foot
the
snow
was
three
feet
deep
but
for
the
most
part
presented
no
difficulties
even
to
the
baggage
animals
at
the
summit
there
were
no
green
things
except
some
plants
of
not
even
a
blade
of
grass
but
among
the
crevices
appeared
small
fragile
tulips
with
yellow
centres
mixed
with
scarlet
and
mauve
blossoms
of
a
more
vigorous
make
at
that
great
height
the
air
was
keen
and
bracing
and
to
eyes
for
months
accustomed
to
regions
buried
in
dazzling
snow
and
to
glaring
gravelly
wastes
there
was
something
perfectly
entrancing
about
the
view
on
the
bakhtiari
side
though
treeless
it
looked
like
paradise
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
is
the
deep
valley
of
seligun
feet
high
with
the
range
of
the
to
the
south
and
of
the
to
the
north
green
full
of
springs
and
streams
with
two
lakes
bringing
down
the
blue
of
heaven
to
earth
with
slopes
aflame
with
the
crimson
and
and
levels
one
golden
glory
with
a
yellow
ranunculus
rich
and
dark
was
the
green
of
the
grass
tall
and
deep
on
the
plain
but
when
creeping
up
the
ravines
to
meet
the
snows
short
green
sward
enamelled
with
tulips
great
masses
of
naked
rock
and
ranges
of
masses
behind
and
above
walled
in
that
picture
of
cool
serenity
its
loneliness
only
broken
by
three
black
tents
of
ilyats
far
away
so
i
saw
seligun
but
those
who
see
it
a
month
hence
will
find
only
a
brown
and
dusty
plain
the
range
we
crossed
divides
the
chahar
mahals
from
the
true
bakhtiari
country
a
land
of
mountains
which
rumour
crests
with
eternal
snow
of
unexplored
valleys
and
streams
of
feudal
chiefs
of
blood
feuds
and
of
nomad
tribes
moving
with
vast
flocks
and
herds
mehemet
ali
a
new
and
undesirable
acquisition
was
loaded
with
my
and
we
clambered
down
the
hillside
leading
our
horses
amidst
tamarisk
scrub
and
a
glory
of
tulips
till
we
reached
the
level
when
a
gallop
brought
us
to
the
camps
pitched
near
a
vigorous
spring
in
the
green
grass
that
halt
was
luxury
for
man
and
beast
later
the
air
was
cool
and
moist
the
white
fleeces
which
had
been
rolling
among
the
higher
hills
darkened
and
thickened
into
drifting
stormily
and
only
revealing
here
and
there
through
their
rifts
glimpses
of
blue
a
few
flocks
of
sheep
on
the
mountains
and
the
mules
and
horses
revelling
in
the
juicy
grass
were
the
sole
representatives
of
animated
life
it
was
a
real
refreshment
to
be
away
from
the
dust
of
mud
villages
and
to
escape
from
the
pressure
of
noisy
and
curious
crowds
and
the
sight
of
sore
eyes
towards
evening
a
gallop
on
the
arabs
with
the
bakhtiari
escort
took
us
to
the
camp
of
the
ilyats
orientals
spend
much
of
their
time
in
the
quiet
contemplation
of
cooking
pots
and
these
nomads
were
not
an
exception
for
they
were
all
sitting
round
a
brushwood
fire
on
which
the
evening
meal
of
meat
broth
with
herbs
was
being
prepared
the
women
were
unveiled
both
men
and
women
are
of
quite
a
different
type
from
the
persians
they
are
completely
clothed
and
in
appearance
are
certainly
only
these
tents
consisted
of
stones
rudely
laid
to
a
height
of
two
feet
at
the
back
over
which
there
is
a
canopy
with
an
open
front
and
sides
of
woven
supported
on
poles
such
tents
are
barely
a
shelter
from
wind
and
rain
but
in
them
generations
of
ilyats
are
born
and
die
despising
those
of
their
race
who
settle
in
villages
there
were
great
masses
of
rolling
clouds
great
banks
of
glistering
white
clouds
a
cold
roystering
wind
a
lurid
glow
and
then
a
cloudy
twilight
threw
up
his
heels
and
galloped
over
the
moist
grass
the
bakhtiaris
two
on
one
horse
laughed
and
yelled
there
was
the
desert
freedom
without
the
desert
it
was
the
most
inspiriting
evening
i
have
spent
in
persia
truth
compels
me
to
add
that
there
were
legions
of
black
flies
in
the
early
morning
after
riding
round
the
end
of
the
valley
we
passed
by
the
lake
seligun
or
albolaki
banked
up
by
a
revetment
of
rude
masonry
the
wind
was
strong
and
drove
the
water
in
a
long
line
of
foam
on
the
shore
storks
were
standing
in
a
row
fishing
cool
scuds
of
rain
made
the
morning
homelike
then
there
was
a
hill
ascent
from
which
the
view
of
snowy
mountains
gashed
by
deep
ravines
and
backed
by
clouds
was
magnificent
and
then
a
steep
and
rocky
defile
which
involved
walking
its
sides
gaudy
with
the
which
here
attains
a
size
and
a
depth
of
colouring
of
which
we
have
no
conception
in
this
pass
we
met
a
large
number
of
ilyat
families
going
up
to
their
summer
quarters
with
their
brown
flocks
of
sheep
and
their
black
flocks
of
goats
their
tents
with
all
their
other
goods
were
packed
in
convenient
parcels
on
small
cows
and
the
women
with
babies
and
big
wooden
cradles
were
on
asses
the
women
without
babies
the
elder
children
and
the
men
walked
whatever
beauty
these
women
possessed
was
in
the
meg
merrilees
style
with
a
certain
weirdness
about
it
they
had
large
dark
long
eyes
with
eyebrows
artificially
prolonged
straight
prominent
noses
wide
mouths
with
thin
lips
long
straight
chins
and
masses
of
black
hair
falling
on
each
side
of
the
face
their
dress
consisted
of
enormously
full
dark
blue
cotton
trousers
drawn
in
at
the
ankles
and
suspended
over
the
hips
not
from
the
waist
the
invariable
custom
in
persia
and
loose
sleeved
vests
open
in
front
the
adult
women
all
wear
a
piece
of
cotton
pinned
on
the
head
and
falling
over
the
back
and
shoulders
the
men
had
their
hair
in
many
long
plaits
hanging
from
under
felt
and
wore
wide
blue
cotton
trousers
white
or
printed
cotton
shirts
over
these
and
girdles
in
which
they
carried
knives
pipes
and
other
indispensables
all
wore
shoes
or
sandals
of
some
kind
these
men
were
very
swarthy
but
the
younger
women
had
rich
brunette
complexions
and
were
unveiled
some
bad
worried
the
remainder
of
the
march
which
included
the
ascent
of
an
hill
feet
high
from
which
we
got
the
first
view
of
the
ardal
valley
much
cultivated
till
it
narrows
and
is
lost
among
mountains
now
partly
covered
with
snow
in
the
centre
is
a
large
building
with
a
tower
the
spring
residence
of
the
ilkhani
whose
goodwill
it
is
necessary
to
secure
through
a
magnificent
gorge
in
the
mountains
passes
the
now
famous
karun
a
clatter
of
rain
and
a
strong
wind
greeted
our
entrance
into
the
valley
where
we
were
met
by
some
horsemen
from
the
ilkhani
the
great
ardal
plateau
is
itself
treeless
though
the
lower
spurs
of
the
on
the
south
side
are
well
wooded
with
the
a
species
of
oak
there
is
much
cultivation
and
at
this
season
the
uncultivated
ground
is
covered
with
the
great
green
leaves
of
a
fodder
plant
the
which
a
little
later
are
cut
dried
and
stacked
the
rivers
of
the
plateau
are
the
karun
and
sabzu
on
the
south
side
and
the
river
of
shamsabad
which
brings
to
the
karun
the
drainage
of
the
chahar
mahals
and
enters
the
valley
through
a
magnificent
or
chasm
on
its
north
side
called
darkash
warkash
the
village
of
ardal
is
miles
from
isfahan
on
the
shuster
caravan
route
and
is
about
from
shuster
its
altitude
is
feet
its
long
and
its
lat
on
arriving
here
the
grandeur
of
the
ilkhani
house
faded
away
except
for
the
fortified
tower
it
looks
like
a
caravanserai
the
village
such
as
there
is
of
it
is
crowded
on
a
steep
slope
outside
the
palace
it
is
a
miserable
hamlet
of
low
windowless
mud
hovels
with
uneven
mud
floors
one
or
two
feet
lower
than
the
ground
outside
built
in
yards
with
ruinous
walls
and
full
of
heaps
and
holes
it
is
an
of
dark
poor
smoky
mud
huts
narrow
alleys
with
bones
and
offal
lying
about
gaunt
yelping
dogs
slimy
pools
and
ruins
the
people
are
as
dirty
as
the
houses
but
they
are
fine
in
physique
and
face
as
if
only
the
fittest
survive
there
is
an
much
visited
on
fridays
on
an
adjacent
slope
the
snow
lies
here
five
feet
deep
in
winter
it
is
said
when
we
arrived
the
roofs
and
balconies
of
the
ilkhani
house
were
crowded
with
people
looking
out
for
us
the
agha
called
at
once
and
i
sent
my
letter
of
introduction
from
the
presents
arrived
formal
visits
were
paid
the
ilkhani
principal
wife
appointed
an
hour
at
which
to
receive
me
and
a
number
of
dismounted
horsemen
came
and
escorted
me
to
the
palace
the
chief
feature
of
the
house
is
a
large
over
the
entrance
in
which
the
chief
holds
a
daily
the
deep
balcony
outside
being
usually
thronged
by
crowds
of
tribesmen
all
having
free
access
to
him
the
coming
and
going
are
incessant
illustration
castle
of
ardal
the
palace
or
castle
is
like
a
caravanserai
enclosing
a
large
untidy
courtyard
round
which
are
stables
and
and
dens
for
soldiers
and
servants
in
the
outer
front
of
the
building
are
deep
recessed
arches
with
rooms
opening
upon
them
in
which
the
isfahan
traders
who
come
here
for
a
month
expose
their
wares
passing
under
the
ilkhani
by
a
broad
arched
passage
with
deep
recesses
on
both
sides
and
through
the
forlorn
uneven
courtyard
a
long
dark
arched
passage
leads
into
a
second
courtyard
where
there
is
an
attempt
at
ornament
by
means
of
tanks
and
willows
round
this
are
a
number
of
for
the
ilkhani
sons
and
their
families
and
here
is
the
or
house
of
the
women
on
the
far
side
is
the
fort
a
tall
square
tower
with
loopholes
and
embrasures
a
cerberus
guards
the
entrance
to
the
but
he
allowed
mirza
to
accompany
me
a
few
steps
lead
up
from
the
courtyard
into
a
lofty
oblong
room
with
a
deep
cushioned
recess
containing
a
fireplace
the
roof
rests
on
wooden
pillars
the
front
of
the
room
facing
the
courtyard
is
entirely
of
fretwork
filled
in
with
pale
blue
and
amber
glass
the
recess
and
part
of
the
floor
were
covered
with
very
beautiful
blue
and
white
grounded
carpets
made
by
the
women
the
principal
wife
a
comely
woman
of
forty
advanced
to
meet
me
kissed
my
hand
raised
it
to
her
brow
and
sat
down
on
a
large
carpet
squab
while
the
other
wives
led
me
into
the
recess
and
seated
me
on
a
pile
of
cushions
taking
their
places
in
a
row
on
the
floor
opposite
but
scarcely
raising
their
eyes
and
never
speaking
one
word
the
rest
of
the
room
was
full
of
women
and
children
standing
and
many
more
blocked
up
the
doorways
all
crowding
forward
in
spite
of
objurgations
and
smart
slaps
frequently
administered
by
the
principal
wife
the
three
young
wives
are
bakhtiaris
and
their
style
of
beauty
is
novel
to
me
straight
noses
wide
mouths
thin
lips
and
long
chins
each
has
three
stars
tattooed
on
her
chin
one
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
and
several
on
the
back
of
the
hands
the
eyebrows
are
not
only
elongated
with
indigo
but
are
made
to
meet
across
the
nose
the
and
inside
of
the
hands
are
stained
with
henna
the
hair
hangs
round
their
wild
handsome
faces
down
to
their
in
loose
heavy
but
not
uncleanly
masses
among
the
bakhtiari
women
as
among
the
persians
the
hair
receives
very
great
attention
although
it
is
seldom
exhibited
it
is
naturally
jet
black
and
very
abundant
it
is
washed
at
least
once
a
week
with
a
thin
paste
of
a
yellowish
clay
found
among
the
mountains
which
has
a
very
cleansing
effect
but
the
women
are
not
content
with
their
hair
as
it
is
and
alter
its
tinge
by
elaborate
arts
they
make
a
thick
paste
of
henna
leave
it
on
for
two
hours
and
then
wash
it
off
the
result
is
a
rich
auburn
tint
a
similar
paste
made
of
powdered
indigo
leaves
is
then
plastered
over
the
hair
for
two
hours
on
its
removal
the
locks
are
dark
green
but
in
hours
more
they
become
a
rich
the
process
needs
repeating
about
every
twenty
days
but
it
helps
to
fill
up
the
infinite
leisure
of
life
it
is
performed
by
the
bath
attendants
in
justice
to
my
sex
i
must
add
that
the
men
dye
their
hair
to
an
equal
extent
with
the
women
from
the
shining
of
the
moustache
to
the
brilliant
orange
of
the
beard
of
hadji
hussein
by
which
he
forfeits
though
not
in
persian
estimation
the
respect
due
to
age
some
of
the
ilkhani
children
and
have
the
hair
dyed
with
henna
alone
to
a
rich
auburn
tint
which
is
very
becoming
to
the
auburn
eyes
and
delicate
paleness
of
some
of
them
the
wives
wore
enormously
full
black
silk
trousers
drawn
tight
at
the
ankles
with
an
interregnum
between
them
and
short
black
vests
loose
and
open
in
front
and
black
silk
sheets
attached
to
a
band
fixed
on
the
head
enveloped
their
persons
they
have
as
is
usual
among
these
people
small
and
beautiful
hands
with
taper
fingers
and
nails
carefully
kept
the
chief
wife
who
rules
the
others
rumour
says
was
also
dressed
in
black
she
has
a
certain
degree
of
comely
dignity
about
her
and
having
seen
something
of
the
outer
world
in
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
vi√¢
baghdad
returning
by
egypt
and
persia
and
having
also
lived
in
tihran
her
intelligence
has
been
somewhat
awakened
the
bakhtiari
women
generally
are
neither
veiled
nor
secluded
but
the
higher
chiefs
who
have
been
at
the
capital
think
it
to
adopt
the
persian
customs
regarding
women
and
the
inferior
chiefs
when
they
have
houses
follow
their
example
my
conversation
with
the
queen
consisted
chiefly
of
question
and
answer
varied
by
an
occasional
divergence
on
her
part
into
an
animated
talk
with
mirza
yusuf
among
the
many
questions
asked
were
these
at
what
age
our
women
marry
how
many
wives
the
agha
has
how
long
our
women
are
allowed
to
keep
their
boys
with
them
why
i
do
not
dye
my
hair
if
i
know
of
anything
to
take
away
wrinkles
to
whiten
teeth
if
our
men
divorce
their
wives
when
they
are
forty
why
had
refused
a
bakhtiari
wife
if
i
am
travelling
to
collect
herbs
if
i
am
looking
for
the
plant
which
if
found
would
turn
the
base
metals
into
gold
etc
she
said
they
had
very
dull
lives
and
knew
nothing
of
any
customs
but
their
own
that
they
would
like
to
see
the
agha
who
they
heard
was
a
head
taller
than
their
tallest
men
that
they
hoped
i
should
be
at
chigakhor
when
they
were
there
as
it
would
be
less
dull
and
she
apologised
for
not
offering
tea
or
sweetmeats
as
it
is
the
fast
of
the
ramazan
which
they
observe
very
strictly
i
told
them
that
the
agha
wished
to
take
their
photographs
and
the
hadji
ilkhani
along
with
them
they
were
quite
delighted
but
it
occurred
to
them
that
they
must
first
get
the
ilkhani
consent
this
was
refused
and
one
of
his
sons
whose
wife
is
very
handsome
said
we
can
not
allow
pictures
to
be
made
of
our
women
it
is
not
our
custom
we
can
not
allow
pictures
of
our
women
to
be
in
strange
hands
no
good
women
have
their
pictures
taken
among
the
tribes
you
may
find
women
base
enough
to
be
photographed
the
chief
wife
offered
to
make
me
a
present
of
her
grandson
to
whom
i
am
giving
a
tonic
if
i
can
make
him
strong
and
cure
his
deafness
he
is
a
pale
precocious
child
of
ten
with
hazel
eyes
and
hair
made
artificially
auburn
when
the
remarkably
frivolous
conversation
flagged
they
brought
children
afflicted
with
such
maladies
as
ophthalmia
scabies
and
sore
eyes
to
be
cured
but
rejected
my
dictum
that
a
copious
use
of
soap
and
water
must
precede
all
remedies
among
the
adults
headaches
loss
of
appetite
and
dyspepsia
seem
the
prevailing
ailments
love
potions
were
asked
for
and
charms
to
bring
back
lost
love
with
special
earnestness
and
the
woful
looks
assumed
when
i
told
the
applicants
that
i
could
do
nothing
for
them
were
sadly
suggestive
there
could
not
have
been
fewer
than
sixty
women
and
children
in
the
room
many
indeed
most
of
them
fearfully
dirty
in
dress
and
person
among
them
were
several
negro
and
mulatto
slaves
when
i
came
away
the
balconies
and
arches
of
the
ilkhani
house
were
full
of
men
anxious
to
have
a
good
view
of
the
feringhi
woman
but
there
was
no
rudeness
there
or
in
the
village
which
i
walked
through
afterwards
with
a
courtesy
escort
of
several
dismounted
horsemen
after
this
the
ilkhani
asked
me
to
go
to
see
a
man
who
is
very
ill
and
sent
two
of
his
retainers
with
me
it
must
be
understood
that
mirza
yusuf
goes
with
me
everywhere
as
attendant
and
interpreter
the
house
was
a
dark
room
with
a
shed
outside
in
a
filthy
yard
in
which
children
goats
and
dogs
were
rolling
over
each
other
in
a
foot
of
powdered
mud
crowds
of
men
were
standing
in
and
about
the
shed
i
made
my
way
through
them
moving
them
to
right
and
left
with
my
hands
with
the
recognised
supremacy
of
a
there
were
some
wadded
quilts
on
the
ground
and
another
covered
a
form
of
which
nothing
was
visible
but
two
feet
deadly
cold
the
only
account
that
the
bystanders
could
give
of
the
illness
was
that
four
days
ago
the
man
fainted
and
that
since
he
had
not
been
able
to
eat
speak
or
move
the
face
was
covered
with
several
folds
of
a
very
dirty
on
removing
it
i
was
startled
by
seeing
not
a
sick
man
but
the
open
mouth
gasping
respiration
and
glassy
eyes
of
a
dying
man
his
nostrils
had
been
stuffed
with
moist
mud
and
a
chopped
aromatic
herb
the
feet
were
uncovered
and
the
limbs
were
quite
cold
there
was
no
cruelty
in
this
the
men
about
him
were
most
kind
but
i
told
them
that
he
could
hardly
survive
the
night
and
that
all
i
could
do
was
to
help
him
to
die
comfortably
they
said
with
one
clamorous
voice
that
they
would
do
whatever
i
told
them
and
in
the
remaining
hours
they
kept
their
word
i
bade
them
cleanse
the
mud
from
his
nostrils
wrap
the
feet
and
legs
in
warm
cloths
give
him
air
and
not
crowd
round
him
under
less
solemn
circumstances
i
should
have
been
amused
with
the
absolute
docility
with
which
these
big
men
obeyed
me
i
cut
up
a
blanket
and
when
they
had
heated
some
water
in
their
poor
fashion
showed
them
how
to
prepare
fomentations
put
on
the
first
myself
and
bathed
his
face
and
hands
he
was
clothed
in
rags
of
felt
and
cotton
evidently
never
changed
since
the
day
they
were
put
on
though
he
was
what
they
call
rich
a
great
owner
of
mares
flocks
and
herds
and
the
skin
was
scaly
with
decades
of
dirt
i
ventured
to
pour
a
little
and
water
down
his
throat
and
the
glassy
eyeballs
moved
a
little
i
asked
the
bystanders
if
as
moslems
they
would
object
to
his
taking
some
spirits
medicinally
they
were
willing
but
said
there
was
no
in
the
bakhtiari
country
a
happy
exemption
the
kindness
supplied
some
whisky
of
which
from
that
time
the
dying
man
took
a
teaspoonful
much
diluted
every
two
hours
tossed
down
his
throat
with
a
spoon
allah
being
always
invoked
there
was
no
gentleness
to
soothe
his
last
hours
a
wife
in
the
dark
den
inside
was
weaving
and
once
came
out
and
looked
carelessly
at
him
but
men
did
for
him
all
that
he
required
with
a
tenderness
and
kindness
which
were
very
pleasing
before
i
left
they
asked
for
directions
over
again
and
one
of
the
ilkhani
retainers
wrote
them
down
at
night
the
ilkhani
sent
to
say
that
the
man
was
much
better
and
he
hoped
i
would
go
and
see
him
the
scene
was
yet
more
weird
than
in
the
daytime
a
crowd
of
men
were
sitting
and
standing
round
a
fire
outside
the
shed
and
four
were
watching
the
dying
man
the
whisky
had
revived
him
his
pulse
was
better
the
fomentation
had
relieved
the
pain
and
when
it
was
reapplied
he
had
uttered
the
word
good
i
tried
to
make
them
understand
it
was
only
a
last
flicker
of
life
but
they
thought
he
would
recover
and
the
ilkhani
sent
to
know
what
food
he
should
have
at
dawn
death
music
wild
and
sweet
rang
out
on
the
still
air
he
died
painlessly
at
midnight
and
was
carried
to
the
grave
twelve
hours
later
when
people
are
very
ill
their
friends
give
them
food
and
medicine
if
a
be
attainable
till
in
their
judgment
the
case
is
hopeless
then
they
send
for
a
who
reads
the
koran
in
a
very
loud
tone
till
death
ensues
the
last
thirst
being
alleviated
meantime
by
dropped
into
the
mouth
camphor
and
other
sweet
spices
are
burned
at
the
grave
if
they
burn
well
and
all
is
pure
afterwards
they
say
that
the
deceased
person
has
gone
to
heaven
if
they
burn
feebly
and
smokily
and
there
is
any
unpleasantness
from
the
grave
they
say
that
the
spirit
is
in
perdition
a
bakhtiari
grave
is
a
very
shallow
trench
the
watchers
were
kind
and
carried
out
my
directions
faithfully
i
give
these
minute
details
to
show
how
much
even
simple
nursing
can
do
to
mitigate
suffering
among
a
people
so
extremely
ignorant
as
the
bakhtiaris
are
not
only
of
the
way
to
tend
the
sick
but
of
the
virtues
of
the
medicinal
plants
which
grow
in
abundance
around
them
a
medical
man
itinerating
among
their
camps
with
a
light
hospital
tent
and
some
simple
instruments
and
medicines
could
do
a
great
deal
of
healing
and
much
also
to
break
down
the
strong
prejudice
which
exists
against
christianity
here
as
elsewhere
the
is
respected
going
in
that
capacity
i
found
the
people
docile
respectful
and
even
grateful
had
i
gone
among
them
in
any
other
a
christian
feringhi
woman
would
certainly
have
encountered
rudeness
and
worse

has
not
been
in
a
hurry
to
call

a
formal
visit
with
his
brother

eldest
son

man
with
a
short
black

a
complexion
and
a
face
somewhat
lined
with
a
slightly
sinister
expression

coat
lined
with

of
fine
buff
kerseymere

and

wide

he
is
a
man

some
dignity

expression
is
somewhat
kindly
and
courteous
he
is
a
devout
moslem
and
has
a
copy
of

koran
which
he
spends
much
time
in
reading
he
is
not
generally
regarded
as
a
very
capable
or
powerful
man
and
is
at
variance
with
the
ilbegi
who
though
nominally
second
chief
practically
shares
his
power
in
fact
at
this
time
serious
intrigues
are
going
on

illustration
imam
kuli
khan
the
greatest
men
who
in
this
century
have
filled
the
office
of
ilkhani
both
perished
miserably
the
fate
of
sir
layard
friend
mehemet
taki
khan
is
well
known
to
all
readers
of
the
but
it
was
possibly
less
unexpected
than
that
of
hussein
kuli
khan
brother
of
the
present
ilkhani
and
father
of
the
ilbegi
isfandyar
khan
this
man
was
evidently
an
enlightened
and
able
ruler
he
suppressed
brigandage
with
a
firm
hand
and
desired
to
see
the
route
fairly
opened
to
trade
he
went
so
far
as
to
promise
mackenzie
of
one
of
the
leading
persian
gulf
firms
in
writing
that
he
would
hold
himself
personally
responsible
for
the
safety
of
caravans
in
their
passage
through
his
territory
and
would
repay
any
losses
by
robbery
he
agreed
to
take
a
third
share
of
the
cost
of
the
necessary
steamers
on
the
karun
and
to
furnish
mules
for
land
transport
between
shuster
and
isfahan
it
appears
that
persian
jealousy
was
excited
by
his
enterprising
spirit
he
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
the
and
in
was
put
to
death
by
poison
while
on
his
annual
visit
of
homage
the
present
ilkhani
who
succeeded
him
warned
possibly
by
his
brother
fate
is
said
to
show
little
if
any
interest
in
commercial
enterprise
and
to
have
made
the
somewhat
shrewd
remark
that
the
english
under
the
dress
of
the
merchant
often
conceal
the
uniform
of
the
soldier
in
the
shah
relented
towards
hussein
kuli
khan
sons
the
eldest
of
whom
isfandyar
khan
had
been
in
prison
for
seven
years
and
they
with
their
uncle
reza
kuli
khan
descended
with
their
followers
and
a
small
persian
army
upon
the
plain
of
chigakhor
where
they
surprised
and
defeated
the
hadji
ilkhani
his
brother
reza
was
thereupon
recognised
by
the
shah
as
ilkhani
and
isfandyar
as
ilbegi
with
the
substance
of
power
another
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
the
brothers
became
respectively
ilkhani
and
governor
of
the
chahar
mahals
and
their
nephew
is
reinstated
as
ilbegi
the
ilkhani
word
is
law
within
broad
limits
among
the
numerous
tribes
of
bakhtiari
lurs
who
have
consented
to
recognise
him
as
their
feudal
head
and
it
has
been
estimated
that
in
a
popular
quarrel
he
could
bring
from
to
armed
horsemen
into
the
field
he
is
judge
as
well
as
ruler
but
in
certain
cases
there
is
a
possible
appeal
to
tihran
from
his
decisions
he
is
appointed
by
the
shah
with
a
salary
of
a
year
but
a
strong
man
in
his
position
could
be
practically
independent
it
can
scarcely
be
supposed
that
the
present
ilkhani
will
long
retain
his
uneasy
seat
against
the
intrigues
at
the
persian
court
and
with
a
powerful
and
popular
rival
close
at
hand
it
is
manifestly
the
interest
of
the
shah
government
to
weaken
the
tribal
power
and
extinguish
the
authority
and
independence
of
the
principal
chiefs
and
the
oriental
method
of
attaining
this
end
is
by
plots
and
intrigues
at
the
capital
by
creating
and
fomenting
local
quarrels
and
by
oppressive
taxation
it
is
not
wonderful
therefore
that
many
of
the
principal
khans
whose
immemorial
freedom
has
been
encroached
upon
in
many
recent
years
by
the
tihran
government
should
look
forward
to
a
day
when
one
of
the
western
powers
will
occupy
persia
and
give
them
security
the
ilkhani
for
the
people
always
prefix
the
religious
title

proposed
journey

me
an
escort
of
a
horseman
and
a
or
begged
us
to
consider
ourselves
here
and
everywhere
as
his
guests
and
to
ask
for
all
we
want
here
and
elsewhere
his
brother
reza
kuli
khan
who
has
played
an
important
part
in
tribal
affairs
resembles
him
but
the
sinister
look
is
more
persistent
on
his
face
he
was
much
depressed
by
the
fear
that
he
was
going
blind
but
on
trying
my
glasses
he
found
he
could
see
the
surprise
of
the
people
when
they
find
that
spectacles
renew
their
youth
is
most
interesting
another
visitor
has
been
the
ilbegi
isfandyar
khan
though
not
tall
he
is
very
and
has
beautiful
hands
and
feet
he
is
able
powerful
and
ambitious
inspires
his
adherents
with
great
personal
devotion
and
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
coming
man
he
was
in
tihran
when
i
was
in
julfa
and
hearing
from
one
of
the
ministers
that
i
was
about
to
visit
the
bakhtiari
country
he
wrote
to
a
general
of
cavalry
in
isfahan
asking
him
to
provide
me
with
an
escort
if
i
needed
it
i
was
glad
to
thank
him
for
his
courtesy
in
this
matter
and
for
more
substantial
help
before
his
visit
his
retainer
mansur
brought
me
the
money
of
which
i
had
been
robbed
in
kahva
rukh
this
man
absolutely
refused
a
present
saying
that
his
liege
lord
would
nearly
kill
him
if
he
took
one
isfandyar
khan
welcomed
me
kindly
regretting
much
that
my
first
night
under
bakhtiari
rule
should
have
been
marked
by
a
robbery
he
said
that
before
his
day
the
tribesmen
not
only
robbed
but
killed
and
that
he
had
reduced
them
to
such
order
that
he
was
surprised
as
well
as
shocked
at
this
occurrence
i
replied
that
it
occurred
in
a
persian
village
and
that
in
many
countries
one
might
be
robbed
but
in
none
that
i
knew
of
would
such
quick
restitution
be
made
in
cases
of
robbery
the
ilkhani
sends
round
to
the
or
headmen
of
the
camps
or
villages
of
the
offending
district
to
replace
the
money
as
in
my
case
or
the
value
of
the
thing
taken
after
which
the
thief
must
be
caught
if
possible
when
caught
the
headmen
consult
as
to
his
punishment
which
may
be
the
cutting
off
of
a
hand
or
nose
or
to
be
severely
branded
in
any
case
he
must
be
for
the
future
a
marked
man
i
gather
that
the
most
severe
penalties
are
rarely
inflicted
i
hope
the
fine
of
levied
on
kahva
rukh
may
stimulate
the
people
to
surrender
the
thief
i
agreed
to
forego
as
isfandyar
khan
says
that
his
men
raised
all
they
could
and
the
remaining
sum
would
have
to
be
paid
by
himself
after
a
good
deal
of
earnest
conversation
he
became
frivolous
he
asked
the
agha
his
age
and
guessed
it
at
on
being
enlightened
he
asked
if
he
dyed
his
hair
and
if
his
teeth
were
his
own
then
he
said
that
he
dyed
his
own
hair
and
wore
artificial
teeth
he
also
asked
my
age
he
and
lutf
and
ghulam
the
sons
who
accompanied
him
possess
superb
watches
with
two
dials
and
an
arrangement
for
showing
the
phases
of
the
moon
having
accepted
an
invitation
from
the
ilbegi
to
visit
him
at
naghun
a
village
ten
miles
from
ardal
accompanied
by
lutf
and
ghulam
we
were
ready
at
seven
the
hour
appointed
as
the
day
promised
to
be
very
hot
eight
came
nine
nine
and
on
sending
to
see
if
the
young
khans
were
coming
the
servants
replied
that
they
had
no
orders
to
wake
them
so
we
europeans
broiled
three
hours
in
the
sun
at
the
pleasure
of
barbarians
during
the
ramazan
these
people
revel
from
sunset
to
sunrise
with
feasting
music
singing
and
merriment
and
then
they
lie
in
bed
till
noon
or
later
to
abridge
the
long
hours
of
the
fast
is
it
such
a
fast
that
i
have
chosen
may
well
be
asked
the
noise
during
the
night
in
the
ilkhani
palace
is
tremendous
the
festivities
begin
soon
after
sunset
and
go
on
till
an
hour
before
dawn
odours
agreeable
to
bakhtiari
noses
are
wafted
down
to
my
tent
but
i
do
not
find
them
appetising
an
eatable
called
is
in
great
request
during
the
ramazan
it
is
made
by
mixing
sugar
and
starch
with
oil
of
sesamum
and
is
poured
on
ready
heated
copper
trays
and
frizzled
into
fritters
masses
of
eggs
mixed
with
rice
clarified
butter
and
jams
concealing
balls
of
mincemeat
and
mutton
stewed
with
preserved
lemon
juice
and
onions
are
favourite
dishes
at
the
ilkhani
besides
the
music
and
singing
the
court
entertains
itself
nightly
with
performing
monkeys
and
dancing
men
besides
and
reciters
of
the
poetry
of
hafiz
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
the
uproarious
merriment
which
drifts
down
to
my
tent
along
with
odours
of
perpetual
frying
owes
none
of
its
inspiration
to
alcohol
coffee
and
being
the
drinks
consumed
we
rode
without
a
guide
down
the
ardal
valley
took
the
worst
road
through
some
deep
and
blazing
gulches
found
the
sun
fierce
and
the
treelessness
irksome
saw
much
ploughing
made
a
long
ascent
and
stopped
short
of
the
village
of
naghun
at
a
large
walled
garden
on
the
arid
hillside
which
irrigation
has
turned
into
a
shady
paradise
of
pear
apricot
and
walnut
trees
with
a
luxurious
undergrowth
of
roses
and
pomegranates
the
young
khans
galloped
up
just
as
we
did
laughing
heartily
at
having
slept
so
late
all
the
village
men
were
gathered
to
see
the
feringhis
and
the
ilbegi
and
his
brothers
received
us
at
the
garden
gate
all
shaking
hands
certainly
this
khan
has
much
power
in
his
face
and
his
dignified
and
easy
manner
is
that
of
a
leader
of
men
his
dress
was
becoming
a
handsome
dark
blue
cloak
lined
with
scarlet
and
with
a
deep
fur
collar
over
his
ordinary
costume
so
much
has
been
said
and
written
about
the
bakhtiaris
being
savages
or
that
the
entertainment
which
followed
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
two
fine
canopy
tents
were
pitched
in
the
shade
and
handsome
carpets
were
laid
in
them
and
under
a
spreading
walnut
tree
a
or
fire
cover
covered
with
a
rug
served
as
a
table
and
cigarettes
a
bowl
of
ice
a
glass
jug
of
and
some
tumblers
were
neatly
arranged
upon
it
iron
chairs
were
provided
for
the
european
guests
and
the
ilbegi
his
brothers
the
ilkhani
sons
and
others
sat
round
the
border
of
the
carpet
on
which
they
were
placed
there
were
fully
fifty
attendants
into
the
midst
of
this
masculine
crowd
a
male
nurse
brought
the
ilbegi
youngest
child
a
dark
quiet
pale
wistful
little
girl
of
four
years
old
a
little
creature
with
a
crimson
velvet
cap
and
a
green
and
crimson
velvet
frock
she
was
gentle
and
confiding
and
liked
to
remain
with
me
after
a
long
conversation
on
subjects
more
or
less
worth
speaking
upon
our
hosts
retired
to
sleep
under
the
trees
leaving
us
to
eat
and
a
number
of
servants
brought
in
a
large
covered
with
food
several
yards
of
blanket
bread
or
flapjacks
served
as
a
and
another
for
the
of
a
huge
in
the
centre
cruets
plates
knives
and
forks
iced
water
russian
lemonade
and
tumblers
were
all
provided
the
dinner
consisted
of
lamb
cutlets
a
curried
fowl
celery
with
sour
sauce
clotted
cream
and
sour
milk
the
food
was
well
cooked
and
clean
and
the
servants
rough
as
they
looked
were
dexterous
and
attentive
after
dinner
by
the
ilbegi
wish
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
ladies
of
his
naghun
rivals
the
other
villages
of
the
tribes
in
containing
the
meanest
and
worst
permanent
habitations
i
have
ever
seen
isfandyar
khan
house
is
a
mud
building
surrounding
a
courtyard
through
which
the
visitor
passes
into
another
round
which
are
the
women
apartments
both
yards
were
forlorn
uneven
and
malodorous
from
the
heaps
of
offal
and
rubbish
lying
under
the
hot
sun
i
was
received
by
fifteen
ladies
in
a
pleasant
clean
whitewashed
apartment
with
bright
rugs
and
pillows
on
the
floor
and
glass
bottles
and
other
ornaments
in
the
at
the
top
of
the
room
i
was
welcomed
not
by
the
principal
wife
but
by
a
portly
woman
the
khan
sister
and
evidently
the
duenna
of
the
as
not
one
of
the
other
women
ventured
to
speak
or
to
offer
any
courtesies
a
chair
was
provided
for
me
with
a
in
front
of
it
covered
with
trays
of
and
other
sweetmeats
mirza
and
a
male
attendant
stood
in
the
doorway
and
outside
shoals
of
women
and
children
on
were
struggling
for
a
glance
into
the
room
several
slaves
were
present
negresses
the
fifteen
ladies
held
their
gay
to
their
faces
so
as
to
show
only
one
eye
so
i
sent
mirza
behind
a
curtain
and
asked
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
their
faces
when
they
all
unveiled
with
shrieks
of
laughter
the
result
was
disappointing
the
women
were
all
young
or
youngish
but
only
one
was
really
handsome
the
wives
are
brunettes
with
long
chins
they
wore
gay
of
muslin
short
jackets
gauze
chemises
and
balloon
trousers
three
of
the
others
wore
black
satin
balloon
trousers
black
silk
jackets
yellow
gauze
vests
and
black
spotted
with
white
these
three
were
literally
like
the
representations
of
the
moon
on
old
clocks
a
type
i
have
not
yet
seen
all
wear
the
hair
brought
to
the
front
where
it
hangs
in
wavy
masses
on
each
side
of
the
face
they
wore
black
silk
set
back
on
their
heads
and
long
chains
of
gold
coins
from
the
back
to
the
ear
with
two
three
or
four
long
necklaces
of
the
same
in
which
the
coins
were
very
large
and
handsome
one
wife
a
young
creature
was
poorly
dressed
very
and
destitute
of
ornaments
her
mother
has
since
pleaded
for
something
to
bring
back
her
husband
love
the
eyebrows
were
painted
with
indigo
and
were
made
to
meet
in
a
point
on
the
bridge
of
the
nose
each
had
one
stained
or
tattooed
star
on
her
forehead
three
on
her
chin
and
a
galaxy
on
the
back
of
each
hand
before
mirza
reappeared
they
huddled
themselves
up
in
their
and
sat
motionless
against
the
wall
as
before
after
tea
i
had
quite
a
lively
conversation
with
the
khan
sister
who
has
been
to
basrah
baghdad
and
mecca
besides
the
usual
questions
as
to
my
age
dyeing
my
hair
painting
my
face
with
suggestions
on
the
improvement
which
their
methods
would
make
on
my
eyes
and
eyebrows
she
asked
a
little
about
my
journeys
about
the
marriage
customs
of
england
about
divorce
the
position
of
women
with
us
their
freedom
horsemanship
and
amusements
she
said
we
do
ride
we
sit
on
horses
dancing
for
amusement
she
could
not
understand
our
servants
dance
for
us
she
said
the
dancing
of
men
and
women
together
and
the
evening
dress
of
englishwomen
she
thought
contrary
to
the
elementary
principles
of
morality
i
wanted
them
to
have
their
photographs
taken
but
they
said
it
is
not
the
custom
of
our
country
no
good
women
have
their
pictures
taken
we
should
have
many
things
said
against
us
if
we
were
made
into
pictures
they
wanted
to
give
me
presents
but
i
made
my
usual
excuse
that
i
have
made
a
rule
not
to
receive
presents
in
travelling
then
they
said
that
they
would
go
and
see
me
in
my
tent
at
chigakhor
their
summer
quarters
and
that
i
could
not
refuse
what
they
took
in
their
own
hands
they
greatly
desired
to
see
the
agha
of
whose
imposing
they
had
heard
but
they
said
that
the
khan
would
not
like
them
to
go
to
the
garden
and
that
their
wish
must
remain
ungratified
we
lead
such
dull
lives
the
khan
sister
exclaimed
we
never
see
any
one
or
go
anywhere
it
seems
that
the
slightest
development
of
intellect
awakens
them
to
the
consciousness
of
this
deplorable
dulness
of
which
fortunately
the
unawakened
intelligence
is
unaware
as
a
fact
two
of
the
ladies
have
not
been
out
of
the
ardal
valley
and
are
looking
forward
to
the
migration
to
the
chigakhor
valley
as
to
a
great
gaiety
they
asked
me
if
i
could
read
and
if
i
made
carpets
they
invariably
ask
if
i
have
a
husband
and
children
and
when
i
tell
them
that
i
am
a
widow
and
childless
they
simulate
weeping
for
one
or
two
minutes
a
hypocrisy
which
though
it
proceeds
from
a
kindly
feeling
has
a
very
painful
effect
their
occupation
in
the
winter
is
a
little
which
takes
the
place
of
our
they
also
make
a
species
of
from
the
manna
found
on
the
oaks
on
some
of
their
mountains
mixed
with
chopped
almonds
and
when
i
concluded
my
visit
they
sent
a
servant
with
me
with
a
tray
of
this
and
other
sweetmeats
of
their
own
making
the
party
in
the
garden
was
a
very
merry
one
the
bakhtiaris
love
fun
and
shrieked
with
laughter
at
many
things
this
jollity
however
did
not
exclude
topics
of
interesting
talk
during
this
time
a
handsome
chestnut
arab
and
my
horse
had
a
fierce
fight
and
karim
a
beloochi
in
separating
them
had
his
arm
severely
crunched
and
torn
the
large
muscles
being
exposed
and
lacerated
he
was
brought
in
faint
and
bleeding
and
in
great
pain
and
will
not
be
of
any
use
for
some
time
the
agha
asked
the
ilbegi
for
two
lads
to
go
with
him
to
help
his
servants
the
answer
was
we
are
a
wandering
people
bakhtiaris
can
not
be
servants
but
some
of
our
young
men
will
go
with
you
and
three
brothers
joined
us
there
absolute
savages
in
their
ways
a
cow
was
offered
for
the
march
and
on
the
agha
jocularly
saying
that
he
should
have
all
the
milk
the
ilbegi
said
that
i
should
have
one
to
myself
and
sent
two
he
complained
that
i
did
not
ask
for
anything
and
said
that
i
was
their
guest
so
long
as
i
was
in
their
country
and
must
treat
them
as
brothers
and
ask
for
all
i
need
do
feel
as
if
you
were
in
a
foreign
land
he
said
we
love
the
english
footnotes
the
readers
interested
in
such
matters
will
find
much
information
on
water
distribution
assessments
and
tenure
of
land
in
the
second
volume
of
the
late
stack
months
in
some
of
the
legends
connected
with
these
objects
are
grossly
superstitious
at
shurishghan
there
is
a
holy
testament
regarding
which
the
story
runs
that
it
was
once
stolen
by
the
lurs
who
buried
it
under
a
tree
by
the
bank
of
a
stream
long
afterwards
a
man
began
to
cut
down
the
tree
but
when
the
axe
was
laid
to
its
root
blood
gushed
forth
on
searching
for
the
cause
of
this
miracle
the
gospels
were
found
uninjured
beneath
it
is
believed
that
if
any
one
were
to
take
the
testament
away
it
would
return
of
its
own
accord
it
has
the
reputation
of
working
miracles
of
healing
and
many
resort
to
it
either
for
themselves
or
for
their
sick
friends
from
northern
persia
and
even
from
shiraz
as
well
as
from
the
vicinity
and
vows
are
made
before
it
the
gifts
presented
to
it
become
the
property
of
its
owners
and
so
it
did
though
it
was
then
so
ill
that
it
seemed
unlikely
that
it
would
live
through
the
night
and
i
told
them
so
before
i
gave
the
medicine
lest
they
should
think
that
i
had
killed
it
of
vol
no
new
series
i
am

the
information
given
above
to
a
valuable
paper

xv
ardal
the
week
spent
here
has
passed
rapidly
there
is
much
coming
and
going
my
camp
is
by
the
side
of
a
frequented
pathway
close
to
a
delicious
spring
much
resorted
to
by
ilyat
women
who
draw
water
in
and
copper
pots
and
gossip
there
the
ilyats
are
on
the
march
to
their
summer
quarters
and
the
steady
tramp
of
their
flocks
and
herds
and
the
bleating
of
their
sheep
is
heard
at
intervals
throughout
the
nights
sometimes
one
of
their
horses
or
cows
stumbles
over
the
tent
ropes
and
nearly
brings
the
tent
down
servants
of
the
ilkhani
with
messages
and
presents
of
curds
celery
pickled
in
sour
cream
and
apricots
go
to
and
fro
sick
people
come
at
intervals
all
day
long
and
the
medicine
chest
is
in
hourly
requisition
the
sick
are
not
always
satisfied
with
occasional
visits
to
the
tent
a
man
who
has
a
little
daughter
ill
of
jaundice
after
coming
twice
for
medicine
has
brought
a
tent
and
has
established
himself
in
it
with
his
child
close
to
me
and
a
woman
with
bad
eyes
has
also
pitched
a
tent
near
mine
at
present
thirteen
people
come
twice
daily
to
have
zinc
lotion
dropped
into
their
eyes
the
fame
of
the
tabloids
has
been
widely
spread
and
if
i
take
common
powders
out
of
papers
or
liquids
out
of
bottles
the
people
shake
their
heads
and
say
they
do
not
want
those
but
the
fine
medicines
out
of
the
leather
box
to
such
an
extent
is
this
preference
carried
that
they
reject
decoctions
of
a
species
of
a
powerful
tonic
unless
i
put
tabloids
of
permanganate
of
potash
condy
fluid
into
the
bottle
before
their
eyes
they
have
no
idea
of
the
difference
between
curable
and
incurable
maladies
many
people
stone
blind
have
come
long
distances
for
and
a
man
nearly
blind
came
in
leading
a
man
totally
blind
for
eight
years
asking
me
to
restore
his
sight
the
blind
had
led
the
blind
from
a
camp
miles
off
octogenarians
believe
that
i
can
give
them
back
their
hearing
and
men
with
crippled
or
paralysed
limbs
think
that
if
i
would
give
them
some
feringhi
ointment
of
which
they
have
heard
they
would
be
restored
some
come
to
stare
at
a
feringhi
lady
others
to
see
my
tent
which
they
occasionally
say
is
fit
for
allah
and
the
general
result
is
that
i
have
very
little
time
to
myself
the
ardal
plateau
is
really
pretty
at
this
season
and
i
have
had
many
pleasant
evening
gallops
over
soft
green
grass
and
soft
red
earth
the
view
from
the
tent
is
pleasant
on
the
one
side
the
green
slopes
which
fall
down
to
the
precipices
which
overhang
the
karun
with
the
snowy
mountains
deeply
cleft
of
the
region
which
is
still
a
geographical
mystery
beyond
them
on
the
other
mountains
of
naked
rock
with
grass
running
up
into
their
ravines
and
between
them
and
me
billows
of
grass
and
wild
flowers
a
barley
slope
comes
down
to
my
tent
the
stalks
are
only
six
inches
long
and
the
ears
though
ripe
contain
almost
nothing
every
evening
a
servant
of
the
ilkhani
brings
three
little
wild
boars
to
feed
on
the
grain
farther
down
the
path
are
the
servants
and
muleteers
camps
surrounded
by
gear
of
all
kinds
and
the
usual
litter
of
an
encampment
the
men
whether
indian
persian
beloochi
or
bakhtiari
are
all
quiet
and
the
motto
of
the
camps
is
silence
is
golden
hadji
hussein
is
quiet
in
manner
and
speech
and
though
he
has
seven
muleteers
yells
and
shouts
are
unknown
there
is
something
exciting
in
the
prospect
of
travelling
through
a
region
much
of
which
is
unknown
and
unmapped
and
overlooked
hitherto
by
both
geographical
and
commercial
enterprise
and
in
the
prospective
good
fortune
of
learning
the
manners
and
customs
of
tribes
untouched
by
european
influence
and
about
whose
reception
of
a
feringhi
woman
doleful
prophecies
have
been
made
may
the
last
day
at
ardal
was
a
busy
one
several
of
the
khans
called
to
take
leave
i
made
a
farewell
visit
to
the
people
came
for
medicines
at
intervals
from
till
numberless
had
to
be
prepared
stores
straps
ropes
and
equipments
had
to
be
looked
to
presents
to
be
given
to
the
ilkhani
servants
native
shoes
with
webbing
tops
and
rag
soles
to
be
hunted
for
to
replace
boots
which
could
not
be
mended
and
it
was
late
before
the
preparations
were
completed
during
the
night
some
of
my
tent
ropes
were
snapped
by
a
stampede
of
mules
and
a
heavy
thunderstorm
coming
on
with
wind
and
rain
the
tent
flapped
about
my
ears
till
dawn
it
was
very
hot
when
we
left
the
next
morning
the
promised
escort
was
not
forthcoming
the
details
of
each
day
march
have
been
much
alike
i
start
early
taking
mirza
with
me
with
the
halt
usually
and
have
a
frugal
lunch
of
milk
and
biscuits
read
till
the
caravan
has
passed
rest
in
my
tent
for
an
hour
and
ride
on
till
i
reach
the
spot
chosen
for
the
camp
occasionally
on
arriving
it
is
found
that
the
place
selected
on
local
evidence
is
unsuitable
or
the
water
is
scanty
or
bad
and
we
march
farther
the
greatest
luxury
is
to
find
the
tent
pitched
the
camp
bed
put
up
and
the
kettle
boiling
for
afternoon
tea
i
rest
write
and
work
till
near
sunset
when
i
dine
on
mutton
and
rice
and
go
to
bed
soon
after
dark
as
i
breakfast
at
four
an
hour
or
two
is
taken
up
daily
with
giving
medicines
to
sick
people
there
are
no
villages
but
camps
occur
frequently
the
three
young
savages
brought
from
naghun
are
very
amusing
from
the
savage
freedom
of
their
ways
but
they
exasperate
the
servants
by
quizzing
and
mimicking
them
the
cows
are
useless
between
them
they
give
at
most
a
teacupful
of
milk
and
generally
none
either
the
calves
or
the
boys
take
it
or
the
marches
are
too
much
for
them
in
the
ilyat
camps
there
is
plenty
but
as
it
is
customary
to
mix
the
milk
of
sheep
goats
and
cows
and
to
milk
the
animals
with
dirty
hands
into
dirty
copper
pots
and
almost
at
once
to
turn
the
milk
into
a
sour
mass
like
whipped
cream
in
appearance
by
shaking
it
with
some
leaven
in
a
dirty
a
european
can
not
always
drink
it
indeed
it
goes
through
every
variety
of
bad
taste
the
camps
halt
on
sundays
and
the
men
highly
appreciate
the
rest
they
sleep
smoke
wash
and
mend
their
clothes
and
are
in
good
humour
and
excellent
trim
on
monday
morning
and
the
mules
show
their
unconscious
appreciation
of
a
holiday
by
coming
into
camp
kicking
and
frolicking
the
baggage
animals
are
fine
powerful
mules
and
horses
with
not
a
sore
back
among
them
the
pack
saddles
and
tackle
are
all
in
good
order
the
caravan
is
led
by
a
horse
caparisoned
with
many
bells
and
tassels
a
splendid
little
gray
fellow
full
of
pluck
and
fire
called
cock
o
the
walk
he
comes
in
at
the
end
of
a
long
march
arching
his
neck
shaking
his
magnificent
mane
and
occasionally
kicking
off
his
load
sometimes
he
knocks
down
two
or
three
men
dashes
off
with
his
load
at
a
gallop
and
even
when
hobbled
manages
to
hop
up
to
the
two
arabs
and
challenge
them
to
a
fight
these
handsome
horses
have
some
of
the
qualities
for
which
their
breed
is
famous
and
are
as
surefooted
as
goats
but
they
are
very
noisy
and
they
hate
each
other
and
disturb
the
peace
of
the
camp
by
their
constant
attempts
to
fight
my
horse
can
go
wherever
a
mule
can
find
foothold
he
is
ugly
morose
a
great
fighter
and
most
uninteresting
the
donkeys
and
a
fat
retriever
are
destitute
of
salient
points
hadji

elevated
his
profession
into
an
art
on
reaching
camp
after
unloading
each
muleteer
takes
away
the
five
animals
for
which
he
is
responsible
and
liberates
them
with
the
saddles
on
to
graze
after
a
time

into
camp
remove
the

and
groom
them
thoroughly
while
the

goes
over
the
equipments
and
does
any
repairs
that
are
needed
after
the
grooming
each
muleteer
having
examined
the
feet
of
his

reports
upon
them
and

three
times
in
the

after
his
valuable

driven
into

operation
after
an
hour
or
more

moves

by

o
the

usually
with
two
men
at
his
head
to
moderate
his
impetuosity

most
obedient

leads
in
cock
o
the
walk
he
is
really
a
very
gentlemanly
man
for
his
position
but
is
unfortunately
avaricious
and
though
he
has
amassed
what
is
for
persia
a
very
large
fortune
he
wears
very
poor
clothes
and
eats
sparingly
of
the
poorest
food
he
is
a
big
man
of
fifty
wears
blue
cotton
clothing
and
a
red
turban
is
very
florid
and
having
a
white
or
very
gray
beard
has
dyed
it
an
orange
red
with

my
servants
have
fallen
fairly
well
into
their
work
but
are
frightfully
slow
all
pitch

tents
and

rides
with

never

and
though
well
educated
has
the
good
sense
not
to
regard
any

as
menial
mehemet

the
superfluity
is
a
scamp
and
i
fear
dishonest
the
servants
feed
themselves
on
a
a
day
allowed
as
road
money
sheep
are
driven
with
us
and
are
turned
into
mutton
as
required
really
they
follow
us
attaching
themselves
to
the
gray
horses
and
feeding
almost
among
their
feet
my
food
consists
of
roast
mutton
rice
tea
and
milk
without
luxuries
or
variety
life
is
very
simple
and
very
free
from
purposeless
bothers
the
days
are
becoming
very
hot
but
the
nights
are
cool
the
black
flies
and
the
are
the
chief
tormentors
on
leaving
ardal
we
passed
very
shortly
into
a
region
little
traversed
by
europeans
embracing
remarkable
gorges
and
singularly
abrupt
turns
in
ravines
through
which
the
karun
here
a
deep
and
powerful
stream
finds
its
way
a
deep
descent
over
grassy
hills
to
a
rude
village
in
a
valley
and
a
steep
ascent
took
us
to
the
four
booths
which
are
the
summer
quarters
of
our
former
escort
rustem
khan
who
received
us
with
courteous
hospitality
and
regaled
us
with
fresh
cow
milk
in
a
copper
basin
he
introduced
me
to
twelve
women
and
a
number
of
children
nearly
all
with
sore
eyes
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
privacy
in
these
tents
with
open
fronts
and
sides
the
carpets
which
are
made
by
the
women
serve
as
chairs
tables
and
beds
and
the
low
wall
of
stones
at
the
back
for
trunks
and
wardrobe
for
on
it
they
keep
their
things
in
immense
made
of
handsome
rugs
the
visible
furniture
consists
of
a
big
copper
bowl
for
food
a
small
one
for
milk
a
huge
copper
pot
for
clarifying
butter
and
a
suspended
from
three
poles
which
is
jerked
by
two
women
seated
on
the
ground
and
is
used
for
churning
butter
and
making
curds
a
steep
ascent
gives
a
superb
view
of
a
confused
sea
of
mountains
and
of
a
precipitous
and
tremendous
gorge
the
through
which
the
karun
passes
making
a
singularly
abrupt
turn
after
leaving
a
narrow
and
apparently
inaccessible
ca√±on
or
rift
on
the
south
side
of
the
ardal
valley
a
steep
zigzag
descent
of
feet
in
less
than
of
a
mile
brings
the
path
down
to
the
karun
a
deep
river
now
swirling
in
drifts
of
foam
now
resting
momentarily
in
quiet
depths
but
always
giving
an
impression
of
volume
and
power
large
and
small
land
turtles
abound
in
that
fiercely
hot
gorge
of
from
to
feet
deep
the
narrow
road
crosses
the
river
on
a
bridge
of
two
arches
and
proceeds
for
some
distance
at
a
considerable
height
on
its
right
bank
there
i
saw
natural
wood
for
the
first
time
since
crossing
the
zagros
mountains
in
january
and
though
the
oak
ash
and
maple
are
poor
and
stunted
their
slender
shade
was
delicious
roses
irises
john
wort
and
other
flowers
were
abundant
the
path
ascends
past
a
clear
spring
up
steep
zigzags
to
a
graveyard
in
which
are
several
stone
lions
rudely
carved
of
natural
size
facing
with
pistols
swords
and
daggers
carved
in
relief
on
their
sides
marking
the
graves
of
fighting
men
on
this
magnificent
point
above
the
karun
a
few
hovels
deserted
in
summer
surrounded
by
apricot
trees
form
the
village
of
duashda
imams
which
has
a
superb
view
of
the
extraordinary
and
sinuous
chasm
through
which
the
karun
passes
for
many
miles
thundering
on
its
jagged
and
fretted
course
between
gigantic
and
nearly
perpendicular
cliffs
of
limestone
and
conglomerate
near
this
village
the
pistachio
is
abundant
and
planes
willows
and
a
clematis
vary
the
foliage
leaving
the
river
at
this
point
a
somewhat
illegible
path
leads
through
scenery
fair
slopes
of
grass
and
flowers
sprinkled
with
oaks
singly
or
in
clumps
glades
among
trees
in
their
first
fresh
green
and
evermore
as
a
background
gray
mountains
slashed
with
snow
in
the
midst
of
these
pretty
uplands
is
the
ilyat
encampment
of
martaza
with
its
black
tents
donkeys
sheep
goats
and
big
fierce
dogs
which
vociferously
rushed
upon
the
retriever
and
were
themselves
rushed
upon
and
gripped
by
a
number
of
women
the
people
having
been
informed
of
our
intended
arrival
by
reza
kuli
khan
had
arranged
a
large
tent
with
carpets
and
cushions
but
we
pitched
the
camps
eventually
on
an
slope
out
of
the
way
of
the
noise
curiosity
and
evil
odours
of
martaza
water
is
very
scarce
there
three
wells
or
pools
fouled
by
the
feet
of
animals
being
the
only
supply
i
rested
on
my
under
an
oak
till
the
caravan
came
up
it
was
a
sweet
place
but
was
soon
invaded
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
quiet
and
privacy
were
out
of
the
question
for
presently
appeared
a
fine
florid
buxom
dame
loud
of
speech
followed
by
a
number
of
women
and
children
all
as
dirty
as
it
is
possible
to
be
and
all
crowded
round
me
and
sat
down
on
my
carpet
this
is
married
to
the
chief
or
headman
but
being
an
heiress
she
bosses
the
tribe
she
brought
up
bolsters
and
quilts
and
begged
us
to
consider
themselves
the
whole
region
and
all
they
had
as
a
present
from
an
inferior
to
a
superior
but
when
she
was
asked
if
it
included
herself
she
blushed
and
covered
her
face
after
two
hours
of
somewhat
flagging
conversation
she
led
her
train
back
again
but
after
my
tent
was
pitched
she
reappeared
with
a
much
larger
number
of
women
including
two
betrothed
girls
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
years
old
who
are
really
beautiful
these
maidens
were
dressed
in
clean
cotton
costumes
and
white
veils
of
figured
silk
gauze
enveloped
them
from
head
to
foot
they
unveiled
in
my
tent
and
looked
more
like
than
any
women
i
have
seen
in
the
east
and
their
beauty
was
enhanced
by
the
sweetness
and
maidenly
modesty
of
their
expression
i
wished
them
to
be
photographed
and
they
were
quite
willing
but
when
i
took
them
outside
some
men
joined
the
crowd
and
said
it
should
not
be
and
that
when
their
betrothed
husbands
came
home
they
would
tell
them
how
bold
and
bad
they
had
been
and
would
have
them
beaten
although
these
beauties
had
been
most
modest
and
maidenly
in
their
behaviour
they
were
sent
back
with
blows
and
were
told
not
to
come
near
us
again
the
agha
entertained
the
for
a
long
time
and
the
conversation
was
very
animated
but
when
he
set
a
very
fine
musical
box
going
for
their
amusement
the
lady
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
became
quite
listless
and
apathetic
and
said
they
much
preferred
to
talk
when
their
prolonged
visit
came
to
an
end
the
led
her
train
away
with
a
bow
which
really
had
something
of
graceful
dignity
in
it
the
next
morning
her
husband
the
and
his
son
mounted
on
one
horse
came
with
us
as
guides
and
when
we
halted
at
their
camp
the
took
the
whip
out
of
my
hand
and
whipped
the
women
all
round
with
it
except
the
offending
beauties
who
were
not
to
be
seen
the
is
a
grave
quiet
and
most
man
more
like
a
thriving
merchant
than
a
nomad
chief
though
he
does
carry
arms
he
is
a
devout
moslem
and
is
learned
he
can
read
the
koran
in
a
short
time
the
woodland
beauty
is
exchanged
for
weedy
hills
and
slopes
strewn
with
boulders
getting
other
guides
at
an
ilyat
camp
we
ascended
sanginak
a
mountain
feet
high
from
the
top
of
which
a
good
idea
of
the
local
topography
is
gained
the
most
striking
features
are
the
absence
of
definite
peaks
and
the
tremendous
gorges
and
abrupt
turns
of
the
karun
which
swallows
in
its
passage
all
minor
streams
precipitous
ranges
of
great
altitude
hemmed
in
by
ranges
yet
loftier
or
with
deep
valleys
between
them
well
grassed
and
often
well
wooded
great
clefts
through
which
at
some
seasons
streams
reach
the
karun
mountain
meadows
spotted
with
the
black
tents
of
ilyats
and
deserted
hovels
far
below
with
patches
of
wheat
and
barley
make
up
the
landscape
these
hills
are
covered
with
celery
of
immense
size
the
leaves
are
dried
and
stacked
for
fodder
and
the
underground
stalks
which
are
very
white
are
a
great
article
of
food
both
fresh
and
steeped
for
a
length
of
time
in
sour
milk
after
resting
in
some
ilyat
tents
where
the
people
were
friendly
and
dirty
we
had
a
most
tiresome
march
over
treeless
hills
covered
with
herbs
and
down
a
steep
descent
into
the
gurab
plain
on
which
a
great
wall
of
rocky
mountains
of
definite
and
impressive
shapes
descends
in
broken
spurs
my
guide
who
had
never
been
certain
about
the
way
led
me
wrong
no
tents
were
visible
the
nomads
i
met
had
seen
neither
tents
nor
caravan
two
hours
went
by
in
toiling
round
the
bases
of
green
hills
and
then
there
was
the
joyful
surprise
of
coming
upon
my
tent
pitched
the
kettle
boiling
the
mules
in
food
close
by
the
a
copious
spring
of
good
water
of
which
one
could
safely
drink
this
gurab
plain
one
of
very
many
lying
high
up
among
these
luristan
mountains
is
green
and
pretty
now
a
sea
of
bulbs
and
grass
but
is
brown
and
dusty
from
early
in
june
onwards
it
is
about
four
miles
long
by
nine
or
ten
broad
and
is
watered
by
a
clear
and
wonderfully
winding
stream
which
dwindles
to
a
thread
later
on
the
nomads
are
already
coming
up
the
rest
was
much
broken
by
the
critical
state
of
karim
arm
which
was
swelled
throbbing
and
inflamed
all
round
the
wound
inflicted
by
on
may
and
he
had
high
fever
it
was
a
helpless
predicament
the
symptoms
were
so
like
those
of
gangrene
i
thought
he
would
most
likely
die
of
the
hot
marches
it
was
a
very
anxious
night
as
all
our
methods
of
healing
were
exhausted
and
the
singular
improvement
which
set
in
and
has
continued
must
have
been
the
work
of
the
great
physician
to
whom
an
appeal
for
help
was
earnestly
made
the
wound
is
daily
syringed
with
condy
fluid
the
only
antiseptic
available
and
has
a
drainage
tube
i
have
begun
to
use
eucalyptus
oil
with
which
the
man
is
delighted
possibly
because
he
has
heard
that
it
is
very
expensive
and
that
i
have
hardly
any
left
yesterday
i
had
the
amusement
of
shifting
the
camps
to
another
place
and
hadji
was
somewhat
doubtful
of
my
leadership
on
arriving
at
the
beautiful
crystal
spring
which
the
guide
had
indicated
as
the
for
sunday
i
found
that
it
issued
from
under
a
mound
of
graves
was
in
the
full
sun
blaze
and
at
the
lowest
part
of
the
plain
the
guide
asserted
that
it
was
the
only
spring
but
having
seen
a
dark
stain
of
vegetation
high
among
the
hills
i
halted
the
caravan
and
rode
off
alone
in
search
of
the
water
i
hoped
it
indicated
disregarding
the
suppressed
but
unmistakably
sneering
laughter
of
the
guide
and
in
less
than
a
mile
i
came
upon
the
dry
bed
of
a
rivulet
a
little
higher
up
on
a
scanty
intermittent
trickle
higher
still
on
a
gurgling
streamlet
fringed
by
masses
of
blue
scilla
and
still
higher
on
a
small
circular
spring
of
very
cold
water
with
two
flowery
plateaux
below
it
just
large
enough
for
the
camps
in
a
green
quiet
corrie
with
the
mountains
close
behind
hadji
laughed
and
the
guide
insisted
that
the
spring
was
not
always
there
a
delightful
place
it
is
in
which
to
spend
sunday
quietly
with
its
musical
ripple
of
water
its
carpet
of
scilla
its
beds
of
white
and
purple
irises
its
slopes
ablaze
with
the
and
its
sweet
calm
view
of
the
green
gurab
plain
and
the
silver
windings
of
the
dinarud
above
the
spring
is
the
precipitous
hill
of
tur
with
the
remains
of
a
rude
fort
on
its
shattered
rocky
summit
two
similar
ruins
are
visible
from
tur
one
on
a
rocky
ledge
of
an
offshoot
of
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
dinarud
valley
the
other
on
the
crest
of
a
noble
headland
of
the
sanganaki
range
which
is
visible
throughout
the
whole
region
the
local
legend
concerning
them
is
that
long
before
the
days
of
the
parthian
kings
and
when
bows
and
arrows
were
the
only
weapons
known
iron
being
undiscovered
there
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
gurab
a
king
called
faruk
padishah
who
had
three
sons
salmon
tur
and
iraj
it
does
not
appear
to
be
usual
among
the
bakhtiaris
for
sons
to
get
on
together
after
their
father
death
and
the
three
youths
quarrelled
and
built
these
three
impregnable
forts
killa
tur
the
one
i
examined
killa
iraj
and
killa
salmon
the
beautiful
valley
was
evidently
too
narrow
for
their
ambition
and
leaving
their
uncomfortable
fastnesses
they
went
northwards
and
founded
three
empires
salmon
to
the
golden
horn
where
he
founded
stamboul
tur
to
turkistan
and
iraj
became
the
founder
of
the
iranian
empire
killa
tur
is
a
stone
building
mostly
below
the
surface
of
the
of
rough
hewn
stone
cemented
with
lime
mortar
of
the
hardness
of
concrete
the
inner
space
of
the
fort
is
not
more
than
eighty
square
yards
the
walls
are
from
three
to
six
feet
thick
may
the
last
twelve
days
have
been
spent
in
marching
through
a
country
which
has
not
been
traversed
by
europeans
only
crossed
along
the
main
track
on
leaving
the
pleasant
camp
of
tur
we
descended
to
the
gurab
plain
purple
in
patches
with
a
showy
species
of
garlic
skirted
the
base
of
the
tur
spur
and
rode
for
some
miles
along
the
left
bank
of
the
dinarud
which
after
watering
the
plain
of
gurab
sparkles
and
rushes
down
a
grassy
valley
bright
with
roses
and
lilies
and
well
wooded
with
oak
elm
and
hawthorn
this
river
gaining
continually
in
volume
makes
a
turbulent
descent
to
the
karun
a
few
miles
from
the
point
where
we
left
it
this
was
the
finest
march
of
the
journey
the
mountain
forms
were
grander
and
more
definite
the
vegetation
richer
the
scenery
more
varied
and
a
kindlier
atmosphere
pervaded
it
in
the
midst
of
a
wood
of
fine
walnut
trees
ash
and
hawthorn
laced
together
by
the
tendrils
of
vines
a
copious
stream
tumbles
over
rocks
fringed
with
and
sparkles
through
grass
purple
with
orchises
this
is
the
only
time
that
i
have
seen
the
one
or
the
other
in
persia
and
it
was
like
an
unexpected
meeting
with
dear
friends
crossing
the
dinarud
on
a
twig
bridge
fording
a
turbulent
affluent
which
bursts
full
fledged
from
the
mountain
side
and
ascending
for
some
hours
through
grassy
glades
wooded
with
oak
and
elm
we
camped
for
two
days
on
the
alpine
meadow
of
arjul
scantily
watered
but
now
very
green
oak
woods
come
down
upon
it
the
vines
are
magnificent
and
there
is
some
cultivation
of
wheat
which
is
sown
by
the
nomads
before
their
departure
in
the
late
autumn
and
is
reaped
during
their
summer
sojourn
there
are
no
tents
there
at
present
yet
from
camps
near
and
far
on
horseback
and
on
foot
people
came
for
and
remained
at
night
to
have
them
dropped
into
their
eyes
the
next
morning
i
was
awakened
at
dawn
by
mirza
voice
calling
to
me
madam
hadji
wants
you
to
come
down
and
sew
up
a
mule
that
been
gored
by
a
wild
boar
awfully
gored
it
was
a
piece
of
skin
about
ten
inches
square
was
hanging
down
between
its
forelegs
and
a
broad
wound
the
depth
of
my
hand
and
fully
a
foot
long
extended
right
into
its
chest
with
a
great
piece
taken
out
i
did
what
i
could
but
the
animal
had
to
be
left
behind
to
be
cured
by
the
who
left
us
there
another
misfortune
to
hadji
was
the
loss
of
the
fiery
leader
of
the
caravan
cock
o
the
walk
but
late
at
night
he
was
brought
into
camp
at
dupulan
quite
crestfallen
having
gone
back
to
the
rich
pastures
which
surround
the
the
muleteer
who
went
in
search
of
him
was
attacked
by
some
lurs
and
stripped
of
his
clothing
but
on
some
men
coming
up
who
said
his
master
was
under
the
protection
of
the
ilkhani
his
clothes
and
horse
were
returned
to
him
the
parallel
ranges
with
deep
valleys
between
them
which
are
such
a
feature
of
this
country
are
seen
in
perfection
near
arjul
some
of
the
torrents
of
this
mountain
region
are
already
dry
but
their
broad
stony
beds
full
of
monstrous
boulders
arrest
the
fury
with
which
at
times
they
seek
the
karun
one
of
these
the
imamzada
passes
through
the
most
precipitous
and
narrow
gorge
which
it
is
possible
to
travel
even
with
unloaded
mules
the
narrow
path
is
chiefly
rude
rock
ladders
threading
a
gorge
or
chasm
on
a
gigantic
scale
with
a
compressed
body
of
water
thundering
below
concealed
mainly
by
gnarled
and
contorted
trees
which
find
in
every
rift
where
the
chasm
widens
for
a
space
before
narrowing
to
a
throat
we
forded
it
and
through
glades
and
wooded
uplands
reached
arjul
descending
and
crossing
the
torrent
by
the
same
ford
on
the
march
to
dupulan
the
next
day
owing
to
the
loss
of
two
baggage
animals
and
the
necessary
of
the
loads
i
was
late
in
starting
from
arjul
and
the
heat
as
we
descended
to
the
lower
levels
was
very
great
the
atmosphere
being
misty
as
well
as
sultry
passing
upwards
through
glades
wooded
with
oaks
the
path
emerges
on
high
gravelly
uplands
above
the
tremendous
gorge
of
the
karun
the
manifold
windings
of
which
it
follows
at
a
great
height
from
the
first
sight
of
this
river
in
the
ardal
valley
to
its
emergence
at
dupulan
just
below
these
heights
it
has
come
down
with
abrupt
turns
and
singular
sinuosities
a
full
rapid
powerful
volume
of
water
through
a
ravine
or
gorge
or
chasm
from
to
feet
in
depth
now
narrowing
now
widening
but
always
feature
of
the
landscape
it
would
be
natural
to
use
the
usual
phrase
and
write
of
the
karun
having
carved
this
passage
for
itself
but
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
this
is
not
the
case
but
that
its
waters
found
their
way
into
channels
already
riven
by
some
of
those
mighty
operations
of
nature
which
have
made
of
this
country
a
region
of
walls
and
clefts
illustration
the
karun
at
dupulan
a
long
very
steep
gravelly
descent
leads
from
these
high
lands
down
to
the
karun
and
to
one
of
the
routes
little
used
however
from
isfahan
to
shuster
it
is
reported
as
being
closed
by
snow
four
months
of
the
year
the
scenery
changed
its
aspect
here
and
for
walls
and
parapets
of
splintered
rock
there
are
rounded
gravelly
hills
and
stretching
uplands
the
three
groups
of
most
wretched
mud
hovels
which
form

village
of
dupulan
two

on
an
eminence
on
the
left
bank
of
the
karun
which
emerges
from
its
long
imprisonment
in
a
gorge
in
the
mountains
by
a
narrow
passage
between
two
lofty
walls
of
rock
so
smooth
and
regular
in
their
slope
and
so
perfect
a
gateway
as
to
suggest
art
rather
than
nature
this
river
the
volume
of
which
is
rapidly
augmenting
on
its
downward
course
is
here
compressed
into
a
width
of
about
twenty
yards
at
this
point
a
stone
bridge
built
by
hussein
kuli
khan
of
one
large
pointed
arch
with
a
smaller
one
for
the
flood
and
a
rough
roadway
corresponding
to
the
arch

the
steepness
of
its
pitch

the
stream
which
passes
onwards
gently
and
smoothly

in
that
direction
has
been
explored
by
several
travellers

to
the
and
after
a
considerable
bend
enters
the
levels
above
shuster
by
a
course
near
the
bridge
the
karun
is
joined
by
the
sabzu
a
very
vigorous
torrent
from
the
ardal
plain
which
is
crossed
by
a
twig
bridge
safer
than
it
looks
the
camps
were
pitched
in
apricot
orchards
in
the
sabzu
ravine
near
some
trees
which
are
now
bearing
their
sweet
gray
and
yellow
blossoms
which
will
be
succeeded
by
auburn
tresses
of
a
woolly
but
very
pleasant
fruit
dupulan
has
an
altitude
of
only
feet
and
in
its
course
from
the
to
this
point
the
karun
has
descended
about
feet
though
there
was
a
breeze
and
both
ends
of
my
tent
and
the
were
open
the
mercury
was
at
inside
and
at
at
outside
on
may
there
were
no
supplies
and
even
milk
was
unattainable
the
road
we
followed
ascends
the
dupulan
pass
which
it
crosses
at
a
height
of
feet
the
path
is
very
bad
hardly
to
be
called
a
path
the
valley
which
it
ascends
is
packed
with
large
and
small
boulders
with
round
stones
among
them
and
such
track
as
there
is
makes
sharp
zigzags
over
and
among
these
rocks
was
very
unwilling
to
face
the
difficulties
which
took
two
hours
to
surmount
the
ascent
was
hampered
by
coming
upon
a
tribe
of
ilyats
on
the
move
who
at
times
blocked
up
the
pass
with
their
innumerable
sheep
and
goats
and
their
herds
of
cattle
once
entangled
in
this
migration
it
was
only
possible

i
excused
myself
from
occupying

saying
that

also
to
escape

of

garlicky
dinner
which
was
being
cooked
for

like
all
else

exceedingly
frivolous

almost
exclusively
interested

persons

ailments
of

in
the
frightful
jealousies

the
servile
deference
paid
by

the
merciless
persistency
of

of
fattiallah
khan
was
not
higher
than
usual
the
ladies
took
off
my
hat
untwisted
my
hair
felt
my
hands
and
shrieked
when
they
found
that
my
gloves
came
off
laughed
immoderately
at
my
bakhtiari
shoes
which
it
seems
are
only
worn
by
men
put
their
rings
on
my
fingers
put
my
hat
on
their
own
heads
asked
if
i
could
give
them
better
hair
dyes
than
their
own
and
cosmetics
to
make
their
skins
fair
paid
the
usual
compliments
told
me
to
regard
everything
as
asked
for
medicines
and
charms
and
regretted
that
i
would
not
sleep
in
their
house
because
as
they
said
they
never
went
anywhere
or
saw
anything
they
have
no
occupation
except
occasionally
a
little
embroidery
they
amuse
themselves
they
said
by
watching
the
servants
at
work
and
by
having
girls
to
dance
before
them
they
find
the
winter
though
spent
in
a
warm
climate
very
long
and
wearisome
and
after
dark
employ
female
professional
to
entertain
them
with
love
stories
at
night
the
elder
lady
sent
three
times
for
a
charm
which
should
give
her
daughter
the
love
of
her
husband
she
is
married
to
another
khan
and
i
recalled
her
as
the
girl
without
any
jewels
who
excited
my
sympathies
in
his
house
marriages
are
early
among
these
people
they
are
arranged
by
the
parents
of
both
bride
and
bridegroom
the
betrothal
feast
is
a
great
formality
the
settlements
having
been
made
by
the
father
and
mother
they
distribute
sweetmeats
among
the
members
of
the
bride
family
and
some
respectable
men
who
are
present
tie
a
handkerchief
round
the
head
of
the
bride
and
kiss
the
hands
of
her
parents
as
a
sign
of
the
betrothal
the
engagement
must
be
fulfilled
by
the
bride
parents
under
pain
of
severe
penalties
from
which
the
bridegroom
parents
are
usually
exempt
but
should
he
prove
faithless
he
is
a
marked
man
it
appears
that
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
is
very
rare
the
betrothal
may
take
place
at
the
tenderest
age
but
the
marriage
is
usually
delayed
till
the
bride
is
twelve
years
old
or
even
older
and
the
bridegroom
is
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
the
settlements
made
at
the
betrothal
are
paid
at
the
time
of
marriage
and
consist
of
a
sum
of
money
or
cattle
mares
or
sheep
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
bridegroom
parents
it
is
essential
among
all
classes
that
a
number
of
costumes
be
presented
to
the
bride
after
the
marriage
is
over
her
parents
bestow
a
suit
of
clothes
on
her
husband
but
these
are
usually
of
an
inferior
or
as
my
interpreter
calls
them
of
a
trivial
description
a
bakhtiari
marriage
is
a
very
noisy
performance
for
three
days
or
more
in
fact
as
long
as
the
festivities
can
be
afforded
the
relations
and
friends
of
both
parties
are
assembled
at
the
tents
of
the
bride
parents
feasting
and
dancing
men
and
women
on
this
occasion
dancing
together
performing
feats
of
horsemanship
and
shooting
at
a
mark
the
noise
at
this
time
is
ceaseless
drums
reeds
whistles
and
a
sort
of
bagpipe
are
all
in
requisition
and
songs
of
love
and
war
are
chanted
at
this
time
also
is
danced
the
national
dance
the
of
which
on
no
other
occasion
except
a
burial
can
a
stranger
procure
a
sight
for
love
or
money
it
is
said
to
resemble
the
of
the
modern
greeks
any
number
of
men
can
join
in
it
the
dancers
form
in
a
close
row
holding
each
other
by
their
and
swinging
along
sidewise
they
mark
the
time
by
alternately
stamping
the
heel
of
the
right
and
left
foot
the
dancers
are
led
by
a
man
who
dances
apart
waving
a
handkerchief
rhythmically
above
his
head
and
either
singing
a
war
song
or
playing
on
a
reed
pipe
after
the
marriage
feast
the
bride
follows
her
husband
to
his
father
tent
where
she
becomes
subject
to
her
the
messenger
after
looking
round
to
see
that
there
were
no
bystanders
very
mysteriously
produced
from
his
girdle
a
black
flattish
oval
stone
of
very
close
texture
weighing
about
a
pound
almost
polished
by
long
handling
he
told
me
that
it
was
believed
that
this
stone
if
kept
in
one
family
for
fifty
years
and
steadily
worn
by
father
and
son
would
then
not
only
turn
to
gold
but
have
the
power
of
transmuting
any
metal
laid
beside
it
for
five
years
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
the
wisdom
of
the
feringhis
knew
about
it
i
went
up
to
my
camp
above
the
village
and
tried
to
rest
there
but
the
buzz
of
a
crowd
outside
and
the
ceaseless
lifting
of
curtains
and
made
this
quite
impossible
when
i
opened
the
tent
i
found
the
crowd
seated
in
a
semicircle
five
rows
deep
waiting
for
medicines
chiefly
quinine
and
cough
mixtures
these
daily
assemblages
of
patients
are
most
fatiguing
the
satisfaction
is
that
some
lame
dogs
are
helped
over
stiles
and
that
some
prejudice
against
christians
is
removed
after
this
fattiallah
khan
with
a
number
of
retainers
paid
a
formal
visit
to
the
agha
who
kindly
sent
for
me
as
i
do
not
receive
any
but
lady
visitors
in
my
tent
the
khan
is
a
very
and
man
of
very
amusing
and
ready
to
be
amused
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
doctored
but
looked
the
opposite
of
a
sick
man
he
and
isfandyar
khan
were
in
arms
against
the
ilkhani
two
years
ago
and
a
few
men
were
shot
he
looked
as
if
he
were
very
sorry
not
to
have
killed
him
the
bakhtiaris
have
an
enormous
conceit
of
themselves
and
their
country
it
comes
out
in
all
ways
and
on
all
occasions
and
their
war
stories
and
songs
abound
in
legends
of
singular
prowess
one
bakhtiari
killing
twenty
persians
and
the
like
they
represent
the
power
of
the
shah
over
them
as
merely
nominal
a
convenient
fiction
for
the
time
being
although
it
is
apparent
that
persia
which
for
years
has
been
aiming
at
the
extinction
of
the
authority
of
the
principal
chiefs
has
had
at
least
a
partial
success
at
such
interviews
a
private
conversation
is
impossible
the
manners
are
those
of
a
feudal
heaps
of
retainers
crowd
round
and
even
join
in
the
conversation
a
servant
brought
the
khan
a
handsome
to
smoke
three
times
he
also
took
tea
a
great
quantity
of
opium
for
exportation
is
grown
about
dehnau
and
the
khan
said
that
the
cultivation
of
it
is
always
increasing
from
dehnau
the
path
i
took
leads
over
gravelly
treeless
hills
through
many
treeless
gulches
to
the
top
of
a
great
gorge
through
which
the
sabzu
passes
as
an
impetuous
torrent
the
descent
to
a
very
primitive
bridge
is
long
and
difficult
a
succession
of
rocky
zigzags
picturesqueness
is
not
a
usual
attribute
of
mud
villages
but
the
view
from
every
point
of
chiraz
the
village
on
the
lofty
cliffs
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
is
strikingly
so
they
are
irregularly
covered
with
houses
partly
built
on
them
and
partly
excavated
out
of
them
and
behind
is
a
cool
mass
of
greenery
apricot
orchards
magnificent
walnut
and
mulberry
trees
great
standard
hawthorns
loaded
with
masses
of
blossom
wheat
coming
into
ear
and
clumps
and
banks
of
roses
measuring
three
inches
across
their
petals
groups
of
women
in
whose
attire
turkey
red
predominated
were
on
the
house
roofs
wild
flowers
abounded
and
the
sides
of
the
craggy
path
by
which
i
descended
were
crowded
with
leguminous
and
umbelliferous
plants
with
the
white
and
pink
dianthus
and
with
the
thorny
of
the
gum
tragacanth
largely
used
for
kindling
now
in
full
bloom
as
i
dragged
my
unwilling
horse
down
the
steep
descent
his
bridle
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
and
i
was
welcomed
by
the
brother
of
fattiallah
khan
who
with
a
number
of
village
men
escorted
me
over
the
twig
bridge
and
up
to
an
exquisite
under
a
large
mulberry
tree
where
the
next
two
hours
were
spent
in
receiving
visitors
it
is
evident
that
these
fine
orchards
must
have
been
the
of
some
powerful
ruler
and
the
immense
yellow
roses
are
such
as
grow
in
one
or
two
places
in
kashmir
where
they
are
attributed
to
jehangir
the
track
from
chiraz
for
many
miles
follows
up
the
right
bank
of
the
sabzu
at
a
great
height
descends
occasionally
into
deep
gulches
crosses
the
spurs
of
mountains
whose
rifts
give
to
contorted
pencil
cedars
and
winds
among
small
ash
trees
and
hawthorns
or
among
rich
grass
and
young
wheat
which
is
grown
to
a
considerable
extent
on
the
irrigated
slopes
above
the
river
it
is
a
great
surprise
to
find
so
much
land
under
cultivation
and
so
much
labour
spent
on
irrigation
channels
some
of
these
canals
are
several
miles
in
length
and
the
water
always
runs
in
them
swiftly
and
the
right
way
although
the
savages
who
make
them
have
no
levels
or
any
tools
but
spades
mountains
much
scored
and
ca√±oned
by
streams
very
grand
in
form
and
with
much
snow
still
upon
them
rise
to
a
great
height
above
the
ranges
which
form
the
sabzu
valley
from
chaharta
an
uninteresting
by
the
river
i
proceeded
by
an
elevated
and
rather
illegible
track
in
a
easterly
direction
to
the
meeting
of
two
streams
forded
the
sabzu
and
camped
for
two
days
on
the
green
slope
of
sabz
kuh
at
a
height
of
feet
close
to
a
vigorous
spring
whose
waters
form
many
streamlets
fringed
by
an
abundance
of
pink
primulas
purple
and
white
orchises
white
tulips
and
small
fragrant
blue
irises
lahdaraz
is
in
the
very
heart
of
mountain
ranges
and
as
the
ilyats
have
not
yet
come
up
so
high
there
were
no
crowds
round
my
tent
for
medicine
but
one
sick
woman
was
carried
thither
eleven
miles
on
the
back
of
her
husband
who
seemed
tenderly
solicitous
about
her
on
monday
i
spent
most
of
the
day
feet
higher
in
most
magnificent
scenery
on
an
imposing
scale
of
grandeur
the
guide
took
us
from
the
camp
through
herbage
snow
and
alpine
flowers
up
a
valley
with
fine
mountains
on
either
side
terminating
on
the
brink
of
a
gigantic
precipice
a
cloven
ledge
between
the
and
a
stupendous
cliff
or
headland
sultan
ibrahim
over
feet
which
descends
in
shelving
masses
to
an
abyss
of
tremendous
depth
where
water
thunders
in
a
narrow
rift
the
sabz
kuh
or
green
mountain
range
famous
for
the
pasturage
of
its
higher
slopes
terminates
in
sultan
ibrahim
and
unites
at
its
eastern
end
with
the
a
range
somewhat
higher
on
the
east
side
of
this
huge
chasm
rises
another
range
of
peaks
with
green
shelves
dark
rifts
and
red
precipices
behind
which
rise
another
and
yet
another
whose
blue
summits
blended
with
the
pure
cool
blue
of
the
sky
in
the
far
distance
in
a
blue
veil
lies
the
plain
of
khana
mirza
set
as
an
emerald
in
this
savage
scenery
with
two
ranges
beyond
and
above
them
the
great
mountain
mass
of
the
riji
whose
snowy
peaks
were
painted
faintly
on
a
faint
blue
heaven
that
misty
valley
irrigated
and
cultivated
with
villages
of
the
janiki
tribe
upon
it
is
the
only
fair
spot
in
the
savage
landscape
elsewhere
only
a
few
wild
flowers
and
a
gnarled
juniper
here
and
there
relieve
the
fierce
blazing
verdurelessness
of
these
stupendous
precipices
never
not
even
among
the
himalayas
have
i
seen
anything
so
superlatively
grand
though
i
have
always
imagined
that
such
scenes
must
exist
somewhere
on
the
earth
a
pair
of
wild
sheep
on
a
ledge
a
serpent
or
two
and
an
eagle
soaring
sunwards
represented
animate
nature
otherwise
the
tremendous
heights
above
the
awful
depths
below
the
snowy
mountains
and
the
valley
with
its
smile
were
given
over
to
solitude
and
silence
except
for
the
dull
roar
of
the
torrent
hurrying
down
to
vivify
the
khana
mirza
plain
after
leaving
lahdaraz
the
path
followed
the
course
of
the
sabzu
through
grass
and
barley
for
a
few
miles
then
there
is
an
abrupt
and
disagreeable
change
to
yellow
mud
slopes
and
high
mud
mountains
deeply
fissured
the
scanty
herbage
already
eaten
down
by
ilyat
flocks
a
desolate
land
without
springs
streams
or
even
ilyat
tents
then
comes
a
precipice
at
an
altitude
of
feet
through
a
cleft
in
which
the
the
road
passes
and
descends
to
the
plain
of
gandaman
as
something
little
better
than
a
sheep
track
on
a
steep
hillside
above
a
stream
the
heat
was
fierce
a
pair
of
stout
gardening
gloves
does
not
preserve
the
hands
from
blistering
spectacles
with
wire
gauze
sides
have
to
be
abandoned
as
they
threaten
to
roast
the
eyes
in
this
latitude
the
heat
of
the
sun
at
noon
is
tremendous
at
the
precipice
top
i
crept
into
a
hole
at
the
base
of
a
rock
for
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
till
the
caravan
staggered
up
it
was
difficult
to
brave
the
sun
direct
rays
he
looked
like
a
ball
of
magnesium
light
white
and
scintillating
in
the
unclouded
sky
on
crossing
the
we
left
behind
the
bakhtiari
country
proper
for
a
time
and
the
chahar
mahals
with
their
mixed
village
population
of
persians
and
armenians
the
descent
from
the
is
upon
a
ruined
armenian
village
with
a
large
graveyard
the
tombstones
are
of
great
size
ten
feet
long
by
three
feet
broad
and
three
feet
high
and
on
each
stone
are
an
armenian
epitaph
and
a
cross
the
plain
of
gandaman
or
wastagun
is
a
very
large
one
over
feet
in
altitude
and
is
surrounded
mainly
by
high
mountains
still
but
to
the
north
by
low
rocky
hills
much
of
it
is
irrigated
and
under
cultivation
and
grows
heavy
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
the
pasturage
is
fine
and
abundant
and
the
people
breed
cattle
and
horses
the
uncultivated
slopes
are
now
covered
with
red
tulips
and
a
purple
and
even
the
dry
gravel
added
largely
to
the
daily
increasing
botanical
collection
illustration
ali
the
camps
were
pitched
on
green
turf
near
three
springs
a
quiet
place
but
there
was
little
rest
we
were
hardly
settled
before
there
was
a
severe
fight
among
the
horses
my
being
the
aggressor
this
was
hardly
quieted
when
there
was
a
sharp
scrimmage
between
the
and
the
agha
three
young
savages
in
which
one
of
them
ali
jan
was
badly
beaten
and
came
to
me
to
have
a
bleeding
face
and
head
dressed
after
that
the
people
began
to
come
in
from
the
villages
for
and
medicines
they
have
no
bottles
nor
have
i
and
the
bring
great
copper
jugs
and
basins
for
an
ounce
or
two
of
lotion
a
very
poor
old
woman
much
afflicted
with
ophthalmia
said
she
had
three
sisters
all
blind
that
she
had
nothing
for
lotion
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
copper
cooking
pot
and
she
cried
piteously
i
had
nothing
to
give
her
and
eventually
she
returned
with
an
with
the
top
neatly
chipped
off
it
is
the
custom
to
raise
the
hands
to
heaven
and
invoke
blessings
on
the
head
but
i
never
received
so
many
as
from
this
poor
creature
the
ride
to
the
village
of
gandaman
where
we
halted
for
two
days
was
an
agreeable
one
after
being
shut
up
among
mountains
and
precipices
space
and
level
ground
to
gallop
over
are
an
agreeable
change
and
in
the
early
morning
the
heat
was
not
excessive
the
great
plain
was
a
truly
pastoral
scene
shepherds
with
long
guns
led
great
brown
flocks
to
the
hills
innumerable
yokes
of
black
oxen
ploughing
with
the
usual
pointed
wooden
share
turned
over
the
rich
black
soil
making
straight
furrows
and
crossing
them
diagonally
mares
in
herds
fed
with
their
foals
and
shepherds
busily
separated
the
sheep
from
the
goats
close
to
the
filthy
walled
armenian
village
of
kunak
there
is
a
conical
hill
with
a
large
fort
in
ruinous
condition
upon
it
and
not
far
off
are
the
remains
of
an
armenian
village
enclosed
by
a
square
wall
with
a
round
tower
at
each
corner
this
must
have
been
until
recently
a
place
of
some
local
importance
as
it
is
approached
by
a
paved
causeway
and
had
an
aqueduct
now
ruinous
carried
over
the
river
on
three
arches
not
only
the
plain
but
the
up
to
a
great
height
are
cultivated
and
though
the
latter
have
the
precariousness
of
the
crops
already
in
ear
promise
well
crossing
a
spur
which
descends
upon
the
north
side
of
the
plain
we
reached
gandaman
a
walled
moslem
village
of
houses
much
planted
chiefly
with
willows
and
rejoicing
in
eight
springs
close
together
the
overflow
of
which
makes
quite
a
piece
of
water
it
has
an
on
an
eminence
and
is
fairly
prosperous
for
besides
pastoral
wealth
it
weaves
and
exports
carpets
and
dyes
cotton
and
woollen
yarn
with
madder
and
other
vegetable
dyes
the
mountain
view
to
the
is
very
fine
i
was
in
my
tent
early
but
there
was
little
rest
for
crowds
of
people
with
bad
eyes
and
woful
maladies
besieged
it
until
the
evening
at
noon
a
gay
procession
crossed
the
green
four
mares
caparisoned
in
red
trappings
each
carrying
two
women
in
bright
dresses
but
shrouded
in
pure
white
sheets
bound
round
their
heads
with
silver
chains
the
of
the
armenian
village
of
libasgun
two
miles
off
accompanied
them
and
said
that
they
came
to
invite
me
to
their
village
for
they
are
christians
then
they
all
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
which
is
welcome
in
this
land
as
a
bond
of
brotherhood
cleanly
comely
and
wholesome
they
looked
in
their
pure
white
gay
red
dresses
and
embroidered
they
had
massive
silver
girdles
weighing
several
pounds
worn
there
only
by
married
women
red
coronets
heavy
tiaras
of
silver
huge
necklaces
of
coins
and
large
filigree
silver
drops
attached
down
the
edges
of
their
too
open
vests
their
heavy
hair
was
plaited
but
not
fastened
up
each
wore
a
stiff
piece
of
white
cotton
over
her
mouth
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
they
said
it
was
their
custom
to
wear
it
and
they
would
not
remove
it
even
to
eat
english
biscuits
they
managed
to
drink
tea
by
veiling
their
faces
with
their
and
passing
the
cup
underneath
but
they
turned
their
faces
quite
away
as
they
did
it
they
had
come
for
the
day
and
had
brought
large
hanks
of
wool
to
wind
but
the
headman
had
the
tact
to
take
them
away
after
arranging
for
me
to
return
the
visit
in
the
evening
he
seemed
an
intelligent
man
libasgun
with
its
houses
is
according
to
his
account
a
prosperous
village
paying
its
tax
of
a
year
to
the
and
making
a
present
only
to
the
ilkhani
it
has
sheep
and
goats
besides
mares
and
cattle
it
has
an
oil
mill
and
exports
oil
to
isfahan
the
women
weave
carpets
and
embroider
beautifully
on
coarse
cotton
woven
by
themselves
and
dyed
indigo
blue
and
madder
red
by
their
gandaman
neighbours
this
man
is
proud
of
being
a
christian
among
the
armenians
christianity
is
as
much
a
national
characteristic
as
pride
of
race
and
strict
monogamy
he
remarked
that
there
are
no
sore
eyes
in
libasgun
and
attributed
it
to
the
greater
cleanliness
of
the
people
and
to
the
cross
signed
in
holy
oil
upon
their
brows
in
baptism
i
rode
to
this
village
in
the
late
afternoon
and
was
received
with
much
distinction
in
the
of
the
house
where
i
was
handed
to
the
seat
of
honour
a
bolster
at
the
head
of
the
room
it
soon
filled
with
buxom
women
in
red
with
jackets
displaying
their
figures
or
want
of
figures
down
to
their
waists
from
the
red
velvet
coronets
on
their
heads
hung
two
graduated
rows
of
silver
coins
and
their
muslin
were
attached
to
their
hair
with
large
silver
pins
and
chains
magnificent
necklaces
of
gold
coins
were
also
worn
illustration
armenian
women
of
libasgun
forty
women
sat
on
the
floor
in
rows
against
the
wall
each
had
rosy
cheeks
big
black
eyes
and
a
white
cloth
over
her
mouth
the
uniformity
was
shocking
they
stared
not
at
me
but
at
nothing
they
looked
listless
and
soulless
only
fit
to
be
what
they
are
the
servants
of
their
husbands
when
they
had
asked
me
my
age
and
why
i
do
not
dye
my
hair
the
conversation
flagged
for
i
could
not
get
any
information
from
them
even
on
the
simplest
topics
hotter
and
hotter
grew
the
room
more
stolid
the
vacancy
of
the
eyes
more
grotesque
the
rows
of
white
diamonds
over
the
mouths
when
the
happy
thought
occurred
to
me
to
ask
to
see
the
embroidered
aprons
which
every
girl
receives
from
her
mother
on
her
marriage
two
mountains
of
flesh
obligingly
rolled
out
of
the
room
and
rolled
in
again
bringing
some
beautiful
specimens
of
needlework
this
is
really
what
is
known
as
russian
embroidery
cross
stitch
in
artistic
colours
on
coarse
red
or
blue
cotton
the
stomachers
are
most
beautifully
worked
the
aprons
cover
the
whole
of
the
front
and
the
sides
of
the
dress
the
mothers
begin
to
embroider
them
when
their
daughters
are
ten
the
cloth
is
put
on
by
girls
at
eight
or
nine
the
women
would
not
remove
it
for
a
moment
even
to
oblige
a
guest
the
perpetual
wearing
of
it
is
one
of
their
religious
customs
only
prevailing
however
in
some
localities
they
say
that
when
our
lord
was
born
his
mother
in
token
of
reverence
took
a
cloth
and
covered
her
mouth
hence
their
habit
when
the
arrived
he
found
the
heat
of
the
room
unbearable
and
proposed
an
adjournment
to
the
lower
roof
which
was
speedily
swept
watered
and
carpeted
an
elaborate
banquet
had
been
prepared
in
the
hope
that
the
agha
would
pay
them
a
visit
and
they
were
much
mortified
at
his
the
great
copper
basins
containing
the
food
were
heaped
together
in
the
middle
of
the
carpets
and
the
guests
fifty
in
number
sat
down
the
men
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
the
wives
of
the
and
his
brothers
serving
there
were
several
with
tea
but
only
three
cups
a
long
bolster
was
the
place
of
honour
and
i
occupied
it
alone
till
the
village
priests
arrived
reverend
men
with
long
beards
high
black
and
full
black
cassocks
with
flowing
sleeves
all
the
guests
rose
and
remained
standing
till
they
had
been
ceremoniously
conducted
to
seats
i
found
them
very
agreeable
and
cultured
men
acquainted
with
the
varying
streams
of
tendency
in
the
church
of
england
and
very
anxious
to
claim
our
church
as
a
sister
of
their
own
this
banquet
was
rather
a
gay
scene
and
on
a
higher
roof
fully
one
hundred
women
and
children
dressed
in
bright
red
stood
watching
the
proceedings
below
i
proposed
to
see
the
church
and
with
the
priests
most
of
the
guests
and
a
considerable
following
of
the
onlookers
walked
to
it
through
filthy
alleys
this
ancient
building
in
a
dirty
and
malodorous
yard
differs
externally
from
the
mud
houses
which
surround
it
only
in
having
two
bells
on
a
beam
the
interior
consists
of
four
domed
vaults
and
requires
artificial
light
a
vault
with
a
raised
floor
contains
the
altar
and
a
representing
the
a
rail
separates
the
men
who
stand
in
front
from
the
women
who
stand
behind
a
liturgy
and
an
illuminated
medieval
copy
of
the
gospels
of
which
they
are
very
proud
are
their
only
treasures
they
have
no
needlework
and
the
altar
cloth
is
only
a
piece
of
printed
cotton
nothing
could
well
look
poorer
than
this
small
dark
vacant
building
with
a
few
tallow
candles
without
candlesticks
giving
a
smoky
light
they
have
two
daily
services
lasting
from
one
to
two
hours
each
and
mass
on
sunday
is
protracted
to
seven
hours
the
priests
said
that
all
the
men
except
two
who
watch
the
flocks
and
nearly
all
the
women
are
at
both
services
on
sunday
and
that
many
of
the
men
and
most
of
the
women
are
at
both
daily
services
one
of
which
as
is
usual
begins
before
daylight
there
is
no
school
the
fathers
teach
their
boys
to
read
and
write
and
the
mothers
instruct
their
girls
in
needlework
after
visits
to
the
priests
houses
a
number
of
villagers
on
horseback
escorted
me
back
to
gandaman
the
heat
of
those
two
days
was
very
great
for
may
the
mercury
marking
in
the
shade
at
one
hundred
and
thirteen
people
came
for
medicines
and
in
their
eagerness
they
swarmed
round
both
ends
of
the
tent
blocking
out
all
air
the
ailments
were
much
more
varied
and
serious
than
among
the
bakhtiaris
illustration
wall
and
gate
of
libasgun
the
last
march
was
a
hot
and
tedious
one
of
eighteen
miles
along
an
uninteresting
open
valley
much
ploughed
bounded
by
sloping
hills
surmounted
by
parapets
of
perpendicular
rock
after
passing
the
large
moslem
village
of
baldiji
we
the
bakhtiari
country
ascended
to
the
bakhtiari
village
of
dastgird
descended
to
the
plain
of
chigakhor
skirted
its
southern
margin
and
on
its
western
side
on
two
spurs
of
the
great
range
with
a
ravine
between
them
the
camps
were
pitched
in
two
days
most
of
the
tents
were
blown
down
and
were
moved
into
two
ravines
with
a
hill
between
them
on
which
the
sahib
on
his
arrival
pitched
his
camp
my
ravine
has
a
spring
with
exactly
space
for
my
tent
beside
it
and
a
platform
higher
up
with
just
room
enough
for
the
servants
a
strong
stream
rudely
brawling
issuing
from
the
spring
disturbs
sleep
there
is
no
possibility
of
changing
one
position
by
even
a
stroll
so
rough
and
steep
is
the
ground
mirza
bringing
my
meals
from
the
cooking
tent
has
a
stick
to
steady
himself
at
first
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
scorched
mountains
opposite
and
the
green
plain
on
which
the
ravine
opens
but
the
tent
was
soon
discovered
and
i
have
had
patients
before
i
am
up
in
the
morning
they
are
sitting
in
rows
one
behind
another
on
the
steep
ground
their
horses
and
asses
grazing
near
them
and
all
day
they
come
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
janiki
tribe
came
with
several
saddle
and
baggage
horses
and
even
a
tent
to
ask
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
great
plain
of
khana
mirza
three
days
march
from
here
to
cure
his
wife
eyes
and
was
grieved
to
the
heart
when
i
told
him
they
were
beyond
my
skill
he
stayed
while
a
great
number
of
sick
people
got
and
medicines
and
then
asked
me
why
i
gave
these
medicines
and
took
so
much
trouble
i
replied
that
our
master
and
lord
not
only
commanded
us
to
do
good
to
all
men
as
we
have
opportunity
but
himself
healed
the
sick
you
call
him
master
and
lord
he
said
he
was
a
great
prophet
a
hak
m
to
us
in
his
i
have
heard
so
much
of
chigakhor
that
i
am
disappointed
with
the
reality
there
are
no
trees
most
of
the
snow
has
melted
the
mountains
are
not
very
bold
in
their
features
the
plain
has
a
sort
of
lowland
look
about
it
and
though
its
altitude
is
feet
the
days
and
even
nights
are
very
hot
the
interest
of
it
lies
in
it
being
the
summer
resort
of
the
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
a
fact
which
makes
it
the
great
centre
of
bakhtiari
life
as
many
as
tents
are
pitched
here
in
the
height
of
the
season
and
the
coming
and
going
of
khans
and
headmen
with
tribute
and
on
other
business
is
ceaseless
the
plain
which
is
about
seven
miles
long
by
three
broad
is
quite
level
near
the
end
is
a
shallow
reedy
mere
fringed
by
a
fertile
swampiness
which
produces
extraordinary
crops
of
grass
far
out
into
the
middle
of
the
level
near
the
same
end
is
a
rocky
eminence
or
island
on
which
is
the
fortress
castle
of
the
ilkhani
the
season
begins
in
early
june
when
the
tribes
come
up
from
the
warm
pastures
of
dizful
and
shuster
to
which
they
return
with
their
pastoral
wealth
in
the
autumn
after
which
the
plain
is
flooded
and
frozen
for
the
winter
at
the
north
end
are
the
villages
of
dastgird
and
aurugun
and
a
great
deal
of
irrigated
land
producing
wheat
except
at
that
end
the
plain
is
surrounded
by
mountains
on
its
southern
side
where
a
part
of
the
sukhta
range
rises
into
the
lofty
peak
of
challeh
kuh
with
its
and
they
attain
an
altitude
of
or
feet
it
is
not
easy
perhaps
not
possible
to
pass
through
the
part
of
the
bakhtiari
country
for
which
we
are
bound
without
some
sort
of
assistance
from
its
feudal
lords
a
responsible
man
for
instance
who
can
obtain
supplies
from
the
people
therefore
we
have
been
detained
here
for
many
days
waiting
for
the
expected
arrival
of
the
ilkhani
a
few
days
ago
a
rumour
arrived
since
unhappily
continued
that
things
were
in
confusion
below
owing
to
the
discovery
of
a
plot
on
the
part
of
the
ilkhani
to
murder
the
ilbegi
stories
are
current
of
the
number
of
persons
put
out
of
the
way
before
he
attained
his
present
rank
for
the
second
time
and
it
is
not
bakhtiari
custom
to
be
about
human
life
no
doubt
his
nephew
the
ilbegi
is
a
very
dangerous
rival
and
that
his
retainers
are
bent
on
seeing
him
in
a
yet
higher
position
than
he
now
occupies
a
truce
has
been
patched
up
however
and
yesterday
the
ilkhani
and
isfandyar
khan
arrived
together
with
their
great
trains
of
armed
horsemen
their
their
splendid
studs
their
crowds
of
unmounted
retainers
their
strings
of
baggage
mules
and
asses
laden
with
firewood
and
all
the
rag
tag
and
bobtail
in
attendance
on
oriental
rulers
following
them
in
endless
nocturnal
procession
come
up
the
tribes
and
day
breaks
on
an
number
of
brown
flocks
and
herds
of
mares
asses
dogs
black
tents
and
household
goods
when
we
arrived
there
were
only
three
tents
now
the
green
bases
of
the
mountains
and
all
the
platforms
and
ravines
where
there
are
springs
are
spotted
with
them
in
rows
or
semicircles
and
at
night
the
camp
fires
of
the
multitude
look
like
the
lights
of
a
city
each
clan
has
a
prescriptive
right
to
its
and
pasture
though
both
are
a
fruitful
source
of
quarrels
and
arrives
with
its
and
complete
social
organisation
taking
up
its
position
like
a
division
of
an
army
when
in
the
early
morning
or
afternoon
the
tribe
reaches
the
everything
is
done
in
the
most
orderly
way
the
infants
are
put
into
their
cradles
the
men
clear
the
ground
if
necessary
drive
the
pegs
and
put
up
the
poles
and
if
there
be
wood
of
which
there
is
not
a
stick
here
they
make
a
fence
of
loose
branches
to
contain
the
camp
but
the
women
do
the
really
hard
work
their
lords
easily
satisfied
with
their
modicum
of
labour
soon
retire
to
enjoy
their
pipes
and
the
endless
gossip
of
bakhtiari
life
illustration
a
cradle
after
the
ground
has
been
arranged
the
tents
occupy
invariably
the
same
relative
position
whether
the
camp
is
in
a
row
a
semicircle
a
circle
or
streets
so
that
the
cattle
and
flocks
may
easily
find
their
owners
abodes
without
being
driven
the
tents
which
are
of
black
goats
hair
cloth
are
laid
out
and
beaten
and
the
women
spread
them
over
the
poles
and
arrange
the
rest
after
which
the
inside
is
brushed
to
remove
the
soot
in
a
good
tent
reed
screens
are
put
up
to
divide
the
space
into
two
or
more
portions
and
some
of
the
tribes
fence
round
the
whole
camp
with
these
screens
leaving
one
opening
and
use
the
interior
for
a
sheepfold
the
small
bushes
are
grubbed
up
for
fuel
the
women
also
draw
the
water
and
the
boys
attend
to
the
flocks
many
of
the
camps
however
have
neither
fences
nor
environing
screens
and
their
inmates
dwell
without
any
attempt
at
privacy
and
rely
for
the
safety
of
their
flocks
on
big
and
trustworthy
dogs
of
which
every
camp
has
a
number
when
they
move
the
bulk
of
the
labour
again
falls
on
the
women
they
first
make
the
baggage
into
neat
small
packages
suited
for
the
backs
of
oxen
then
they
take
up
the
tent
pegs
throw
down
the
tents
and
roll
them
up
in
the
reed
screens
all
that
the
men
undertake
being
to
help
in
loading
the
oxen
it
is
only
when
a
division
halts
for
at
least
some
days
that
this
process
is
gone
through
in
fine
weather
if
a
tribe
is
marching
daily
to
its
summer
or
winter
the
families
frequently
sleep
in
the
open
the
chief
tent
is
always
recognisable
by
its
size
and
is
occasionally
white
i
have
seen
a
tent
of
a
wealthy
khan
fully
sixty
feet
long
a
row
of
poles
not
more
than
ten
feet
high
supported
the
roof
which
was
of
brown
haircloth
the
widths
united
by
a
coarse
open
stitch
on
the
windward
side
the
roof
was
pinned
down
nearly
to
the
top
of
a
wall
of
stones
about
three
feet
high
the
leeward
side
was
quite
open
and
the
roof
which
could
be
lowered
if
necessary
was
elevated
and
extended
by
poles
six
feet
high
if
the
tent
was
sixty
feet
long
it
was
made
by
this
arrangement
twenty
feet
broad
at
the
lower
end
was
a
great
in
the
earth
and
the
floor
of
the
upper
end
was
covered
with
rugs
quilts
and
pillows
the
household
stuff
being
arranged
chiefly
on
and
against
the
rude
stone
wall
the
process
of
encamping
for
a
camp
of
seventy
tents
takes
about
two
hours
and
many
interruptions
occur
especially
the
clamorous
demands
of
unweaned
infants
of
mature
years
the
same
number
of
tents
takes
about
an
hour
a
free
wild
life
these
nomads
lead
full
of
frays
and
plots
but
probably
happier
than
the
average
lot
below
the
castle
is
the
great
encampment
of
the
chiefs
brown
tents
and
white
bell
tents
among
which
the
tall
white
pavilion
of
the
ilkhani
towers
conspicuously
the
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
called
on
me
and
as
they
sat
outside
my
tent
it
was
odd
to
look
back
two
years
to
the
time
when
they
were
fighting
each
other
and
barely
two
weeks
to
the
discovery
of
the
plot
of
the
ilkhani
to
murder
his
nephew
the
ilkhani
face
had
a
very
uncomfortable
expression
intrigues
against
him
at
tihran
and
nearer
home
the
rumoured
enmity
of
the
prime
minister
the
turbulence
of
some
of
the
tribes
the
growing
power
of
the
adherents
of
isfandyar
khan
and
his
own
baffled
plot
to
destroy
him
must
make
things
unpleasant
several
of
the
small
khans
who
have
been
to
see
me
expect
fighting
here
before
the
end
of
the
summer
the
ilkhani
had
previously
availed
himself
of
the
resources
of
my
medicine
chest
and
with
so
much
benefit
that
i
was
obliged
to
grant
a
request
which
deprived
me
of
a
whole
bottle
of
tabloids
in
the
evening
i
visited
the
ladies
who
are
in
the
castle
leading
the
usual
dull
life
of
the
high
above
the
bustle
which
centres
round
the
ilkhani
pavilion
with
its
crowds
of
tribesmen
mares
and
foals
feeding
tethered
saddle
horses
neighing
cows
being
milked
horsemen
galloping
here
and
there
firing
at
a
mark
asses
bearing
wood
and
flour
from
ardal
being
unloaded
a
bustle
masculine
solely
isfandyar
khan
with
whose
look
of
capacity
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
and
lutf
received
us
and
led
us
to
the
great
pavilion
which
is
decorated
very
handsomely
throughout
with
red
and
blue
arabesques
and
much
resembles
an
indian
tent
a
brown
felt
carpet
occupied
the
centre
the
ilkhani
who
rose
and
shook
hands
sat
on
one
side
and
the
ilbegi
on
the
other
and
sons
khans
and
attendants
to
the
number
of
i
daresay
stood
around
we
made
some
fine
speeches
rendered
finer
doubtless
by
mirza
repeated
an
offer
to
send
a
doctor
to
itinerate
in
the
country
for
some
months
in
took
the
inevitable
tea
and
while
the
escorts
were
being
arranged
for
i
went
to
the
fort
it
is
the
fortress
of
the
haft
lang
one
great
division
of
the
bakhtiari
lurs
which
supplies
the
ruling
dynasty
the
building
is
a
parallelogram
flanked
by
four
round
towers
with
large
casemates
and
a
keep
on
its
southern
side
it
has
two
courtyards
surrounded
by
stables
and
barracks
but
there
is
no
water
within
the
gates
and
earthquakes
and
neglect
have
reduced
much
of
it
to
a
condition
over
the
gateway
and
along
the
front
is
a
handsome
suite
of
balconied
rooms
richly
decorated
in
persian
style
the
front
and
doors
of
the
large
being
of
fretwork
filled
in
with
amber
and
pale
blue
glass
and
the
roof
and
walls
are
covered
with
small
mirrors
set
so
as
to
resemble
facets
with
medallion
pictures
of
beauties
and
of
the
chase
let
in
at
intervals
the
effect
of
the
mirrors
is
striking
and
even
beautiful
there
were
very
handsome
rugs
on
the
floor
and
divans
covered
with
kashan
velvet
but
rugs
divans
and
squabs
were
heaped
to
the
depth
of
some
inches
with
rose
petals
which
were
being
prepared
for
and
the
principal
wife
rose
out
of
a
perfect
bed
of
them
these
ladies
have
no
conversation
and
relapse
into
apathy
after
asking
a
few
personal
questions
again
they
said
they
wished
to
see
the
agha
of
whose
height
and
prowess
many
rumours
had
reached
them
but
when
i
suggested
that
they
might
see
him
from
the
roof
or
balcony
they
said
they
were
afraid
again
they
said
they
had
such
dull
lives
and
regretted
my
departure
as
they
thought
they
might
come
and
see
my
tent
i
felt
sorry
for
them
sorrier
than
i
can
say
as
i
realised
more
fully
the
unspeakable
degradation
and
dulness
of
their
lives
a
perfect
rabble
of
dirty
women
and
children
filled
the
passages
and
staircase
on
one
of
my
last
evenings
i
rode
attended
only
by
mirza
to
the
village
of
dastgird
to
see
two
women
whose
husband
desired
medicines
for
them
this
village
is
piled
upon
the
hillside
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
and
a
traveller
can
be
seen
afar
off
i
had
never
visited
any
of
the
camps
so
slenderly
escorted
and
when
i
saw
the
roofs
covered
with
men
and
numbers
more
running
to
the
stream
with
long
guns
slung
behind
their
backs
and
big
knives
in
their
girdles
i
was
much
afraid
that
they
might
be
rude
in
the
absence
of
a
european
man
and
that
i
should
get
into
trouble
at
the
stream
the
whose
wives
were
ill
and
several
of
the
principal
inhabitants
met
me
they
salaamed
touched
their
hearts
and
brows
two
held
my
stirrups
others
walked
alongside
and
an
escort
took
me
up
the
steep
rude
alley
of
the
village
to
the
low
arch
by
which
the
courtyard
all
rocks
holes
and
heaps
is
entered
dismounting
was
a
difficulty
several
men
got
hold
of
one
made
a
step
of
his
back
another
of
his
knee
one
grasped
my
foot
two
got
hold
of
my
arms
all
shouting
and
disputing
as
to
how
to
proceed
but
somehow
i
was
hauled
off
and
lifted
by
strong
arms
up
into
the
the
floor
of
which
was
covered
with
their
woven
rugs
across
which
they
led
me
to
an
improvised
place
of
honour
a
covered
with
a
red
blanket
a
brass
was
steaming
hospitably
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
trays
and
sugar
the
chief
paid
me
the
usual
persian
compliment
your
presence
purifies
the
house
men
crowded
in
shrouded
women
peeped
through
doorways
they
served
me
on
bended
knees
with
tea
la
and
though
they
shouted
very
loud
and
often
all
together
they
made
me
very
cordially
welcome
they
send
their
flocks
with
some
of
their
people
to
warmer
regions
for
the
winter
but
the
chief
and
many
families
remain
though
the
snow
is
from
seven
to
nine
feet
deep
according
to
their
marks
on
a
post
i
rode
to
the
camp
where
the
wives
were
with
the
khan
and
a
number
of
men
on
foot
and
on
horseback
a
messenger
having
been
sent
in
advance
in
the
village
the
great
as
usual
showed
extreme
hostility
and
one
madder
than
the
rest
a
powerful
savage
attacked
me
fixing
his
teeth
in
my
stirrup
guard
and
hanging
on
the
khan
drew
a
revolver
and
shot
him
through
the
back
killing
him
at
once
and
threatened
to
beat
the
owner
was
quite
undisturbed
by
the
incident
the
power
of
the
or
headman
of
a
group
of
families
is
not
absolute
even
in
this
small
area
his
duties
are
to
arrange
the
annual
migrations
punish
small
crimes
summarily
to
report
larger
crimes
to
the
khan
to
collect
the
tribute
conjointly
with
the
khan
and
to
carry
out
his
orders
among
the
families
of
his
group
private
oppression
appears
to
be
much
practised
among
the
and
under
the
feeble
rule
of
imam
kuli
khan
to
be
seldom
exposed
the
office
originally
elective
has
a
great
tendency
to
become
hereditary
but
at
any
moment
the
ilkhani
may
declare
it
elective
in
a
special
case
though
the
offices
of
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
are
held
only
annually
at
the
pleasure
of
the
shah
and
the
are
properly
elective
the
office
of
khan
or
chief
is
strictly
hereditary
though
it
does
not
necessarily
fall
to
the
eldest
son
this
element
of
permanence
gives
the
khan
almost
supreme
authority
in
his
tribe
and
when
the
ilkhani
is
a
weak
man
and
a
khan
is
a
strong
one
he
is
practically
independent
except
in
the
matter
of
the
tribute
to
the
shah
it
was
in
curbing
the
power
of
these
khans
by
steering
a
shrewd
and
even
course
among
their
feuds
and
conflicts
by
justice
and
consideration
in
the
collection
of
the
revenues
and
by
rendering
it
a
matter
of
for
them
to
seek
his
protection
and
acknowledge
his
headship
that
sir
layard
friend
mohammed
taki
khan
succeeded
in
reducing
these
wild
tribes
to
something
like
order
and
hussein
kuli
khan
the
last
real
ruler
of
the
bakhtiaris
pursued
the
same
methods
with
nearly
equal
success
but
things
have
changed
and
a
fresh
era
of
broils
and
rivalries
has
set
in
and
in
addition
to
tribal
feuds
and
jealousies
the
line
of
partisanship
between
the
adherents
of
the
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
produces
anything
but
a
pacific
prospect
these
broils
and
the
prospects
of
fighting
are
the
subjects
discussed
at
my
tent
door
in
the
evenings
illustration
a
dastgird
tent
the
dastgird
encampment
that
evening
was
the
romance
of
camp
life
on
the
velvety
green
grass
there
were
four
high
black
canopies
open
at
the
front
and
sides
looking
across
the
green
flowery
plain
on
which
the
ilkhani
castle
stood
out
a
violet
mass
against
the
sunset
gold
between
the
mountains
there
were
handsome
carpets
mattresses
and
bolsters
steaming
on
big
brass
trays
an
abundance
of
curds
milk
and
whey
and
at
one
end
of
the
largest
tent
there
were
two
very
fine
mares
untethered
with
young
foals
and
children
rolling
about
among
their
feet
i
was
placed
as
usual
on
a
bolster
and
the
tent
filled
with
people
all
shouting
and
clamouring
together
bringing
rheumatism
wind
in
the
bones
sore
eyes
headaches
wind
in
the
head
and
old
age
to
be
cured
the
khan
wife
a
handsome
girl
had
become
an
epileptic
a
fortnight
ago
this
malady
is
sadly
common
of
the
people
who
have
come
for
medicines
here
thirteen
per
cent
have
had
epileptic
fits
they
call
them
faintings
and
have
no
horror
of
them
eye
diseases
including
such
severe
forms
as
cataract
and
glaucoma
rheumatism
headaches
and
dyspepsia
are
their
most
severe
ailments
no
people
have
been
seen
with
chest
complaints
bone
diseases
or
cancer
in
the
largest
tent
there
was
a
young
mother
with
an
infant
less
than
hours
old
and
already
its
eyebrows
or
at
all
events
the
place
where
eyebrows
will
be
were
deeply
stained
and
curved
at
seven
or
eight
years
old
girls
are
tattooed
on
hands
arms
neck
and
chest
and
the
face
is
decorated
with
stars
on
the
forehead
and
chin
though
children
of
both
sexes
are
dearly
loved
among
these
people
it
is
only
at
the
birth
of
a
son
that
there
is
anything
like
festivity
and
most
of
the
people
are
too
poor
to
do
more
even
then
than
distribute
sweetmeats
among
their
friends
and
relations
the
wealthier
families
celebrate
the
birth
of
a
firstborn
son
with
music
feasting
and
dancing
at
the
age
of
five
or
six
days
the
child
is
named
by
whispering
the
divine
name
in
its
ear
along
with
that
chosen
by
the
parents
after
a
long
visit
the
people
all
kissed
my
hand
raising
it
to
their
foreheads
afterwards
and
the
khan
made
a
mounting
block
of
his
back
and
rode
with
me
to
the
main
path
it
was
all
savage
but
the
intention
was
throughout
courteous
according
to
their
notions
it
became
pitch
dark
and
i
lost
my
way
and
should
have
pulled
over
a
precipice
but
for
his
sagacious
one
of
the
finest
sights
i
have
seen
was
my
own
camp
in
a
thunderstorm
with
its
white
tents
revealed
by
a
flash
of
lightning
which
lighted
for
a
second
the
black
darkness
of
the
ravine
the
next
morning
the
khan
of
dastgird
servants
brought
fifteen
bottles
and
pipkins
for
and
medicines
in
spite
of
the
directions
in
persian
which
mirza
put
upon
the
bottles
i
doubt
not
that
some
of
the
will
be
swallowed
and
that
some
of
the
medicines
will
be
put
into
the
eyes
the
last
evening
has
come
after
a
busy
day
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
getting
ready
for
the
start
have
been
great
the
iron
socket
of
my
broke
there
was
no
smith
in
the
valley
and
when
one
arrived
with
the
ilkhani
the
direct
order
had
to
be
obtained
before
he
would
finish
the
work
he
had
undertaken
i
supplied
the
iron
but
then
there
was
no
charcoal
i
have
been
tentless
for
the
whole
day
provisions
for
forty
days
have
to
be
taken
from
chigakhor
and
two
cwts
of
rice
and
flour
have
been
promised
over
and
over
again
but
have
only
partially
arrived
hassan
has
bought
a
horse
and
a
cow
and
they
have
both
strayed
and
he
has
gone
in
search
of
them
and
mirza
in
search
of
him
and
both
have
been
away
for
hours
of
the
escorts
promised
by
the
ilkhani
not
one
man
has
arrived
though
it
was
considered
that
the
letter
to
him
given
me
by
the
would
have
obviated
any
difficulty
on
this
score
an
armed
sentry
was
to
have
slept
in
front
of
my
tent
and
a
was
to
have
been
my
constant
attendant
and
i
have
nobody
of
the
escort
promised
to
the
agha
not
one
man
has
appeared
in
this
case
we
are
left
to
do
what
general
schindler
and
others
in
tihran
and
isfahan
declared
to
be
impossible
viz
to
get
through
the
country
without
an
escort
and
without
the
moral
support
of
a
retainer
high
in
the
ilkhani
service
whether
there
have
been
crooked
dealings
or
whether
the
ilkhani
in
spite
of
his
promises
regards
the
presence
of
travellers
in
his
country
with
disfavour
or
whether
apprehending
a
collision
both
the
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
are
unwilling
to
part
with
any
of
their
horsemen
