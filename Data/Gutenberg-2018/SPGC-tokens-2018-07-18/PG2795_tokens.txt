the
gray
dog
the
sun
stared
brazenly
down
on
a
gray
farmhouse
lying
long
and
low
in
the
shadow
of
the
muir
pike
on
the
ruins
of
and
barmkyn
relics
of
the
time
of
raids
it
looked
on
ranges
of
whitewashed
outbuildings
on
a
goodly
array
of
ricks
in
the
behind
the
lengthy
range
of
stables
two
men
were
thatching

sprawling
on
the
crest
of
the
rick

a

on

of
the
stack
wrapped
apparently
in
gloomy
meditation

todd
a
solid
dales
man
he
with
huge
hands
and
hairy
arms
about
his
face
an
uncomely
aureole
of
stiff
red
hair
and
on
his
features
an
expression
of
resolute
melancholy

vigor

workin
lad
he
whispered
here
master
and
oor
as
he
spoke
a
tall
gaitered
man
with
face
strong
lean
austere
and
the
eyes
of
the
came
striding
into
the
yard
and
trotting
soberly
at
his
heels
with
the
gravest
saddest
eyes
ever
you
saw
a
puppy
a
rare
dark
gray
he
was
his
long
coat
dashed
here
and
there
with
lighter
touches
like
a
stormy
sea
moonlit
upon
his
chest
an
escutcheon
of
purest
white
and
the
dome
of
his
head
showered
as
it
were
with
a
sprinkling
of
snow
perfectly
compact
utterly
lithe
inimitably
graceful
with
his
action
a
gentleman
every
inch
you
could
not
help
but
stare
at
him
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
the
two
stopped
and
the
young
dog
placing
his
forepaws
on
a
lower
rung
looked
up
slowly
waving
his
silvery
brush
a
proper
gray
dog
mused
tammas
gazing
down
into
the
dark
face
beneath
him
small
yet
big
light
to
get
about
on
backs
o
his
sheep
yet
not
too
light
wi
a
coat
hard
to
keep
oot
daleland
weather
soft
as
sealskin
beneath
and
wi
them
sorrerful
eyes
on
him
as
niver
goes
but
wi
a
good
un
amaist
he
minds
me
o
rex
son
o
oh
dear
oh
dear
groaned
but
the
old
man
heard
him
not
did
farewether
tell
yo
hoo
he
acted
this
mornin
master
he
inquired
addressing
the
man
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
nay
said
the
other
his
stern
eyes
lighting
why
was
this
way
it
seems
tammas
continued
young
bull
gets
loose
somegate
and
marches
oot
into
yard
milkpail
and
prods
owd
pigs
i
ribs
and
as
he
stands
lookin
about

what
he
shall
be
up
to

oor
bob
sees
un
what
yo
doin
here
mr

he
seems
to
say
cockin
his
ears
and
trottin
up
wi
that
bull
bloats
fit
to
bust
lashes
wi
tail
waggles
his
head
and
gets
agate
o
chargin
but
bob
leaps
oot
o
way
quick
as
lightnin
yet
cool
as
butter
and
when
he
done
his
foolin
drives
un
back
who
seed
all
this
interposed
sceptically
farewether
from
the
loft
so
there
tammas
replied
and
continued
his
tale
so
they
goes
on
bull
chargin
and
bob
un
back
and
back
hoppin
in
and
oot
agin
quiet
as
a
cowcumber
yet
determined
at
last
bull
sees
it
no

o

gate
so
he
turns
rares
up
and
tries
to
jump
wall
nary
a

young
dog
jumps
in
on
un
and
nips
him
by

wi
that
bull
tumbles
down
in
a
hurry
turns
wi
a
kind
o
groan
and
marches
back
into
stall
bob
after
un
and
then
dang
me
the
old
man
beat

ladder
as
he
loosed
off
this
last
titbit
if

doesna
sit

like
a
sentrynel
till

cried
good
lad
said
the
master
laying
a
hand
on
the
dark
head
at
his
knee
yo
may
well
say
that
cried
tammas
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
a
proper
gray
dog
i
tell
yo
wi
the
brains
of
a
man
and
the
way
of
a
woman
ah

nohow
the
gray
dogs
o
kenmuir
the
patter
of
cheery
feet
rang
out
on
the
over
the
stream
below
them
tammas
glanced
round
here
david
he
said
late
this
mornin
he
a
boy
came
spurring
up
the
slope
his
face
all
aglow
with
the
speed
of
his
running
straightway
the
young
dog
dashed
off
to
meet
him
with
a
fiery
speed
his
sober
gait
belied
the
two
raced
back
together
into
the
yard
poor
lad
said
gloomily
regarding
the
newcomer
poor
heart
muttered
tammas
while
the
master
face
softened
visibly
yet
there
looked
little
to
pity
in
this
jolly
rocking
lad
with
the
tousle
of
light
hair
and
fresh
rosy
countenance
mister
moore
tammas
he
panted
as
he
passed
and
ran
on
through
the
yard
round
the
corner
of
the
stable
and
into
the
house
in
the
kitchen
a
long
room
with
floor
and
latticed
windows
a
woman
and
was
bustling
about
her
morning
business
to
her
skirts
clung
a
sturdy
boy
while
at
the
oak
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
girl
with
brown
eyes
and
straggling
hair
was
seated
before
a
basin
of
bread
and
milk
so
yo
coom
at
last
david
the
woman
cried
as
the
boy
entered
and
bending
greeted
him
with
a
tender
motherly
salutation
which
he
returned
as
affectionately
i
welly
thowt
yo
forgot
us
this
mornin
noo
sit
you
doon
beside
oor
and
soon
he
too
was
engaged
in
a
task
twin
to
the
girl
the
two
children
munched
away
in
silence
the
little
boy
watching
them
the
while
critically
irritated
by
this
prolonged
stare
david
at
length
turned
on
him
weel
little
andrew
he
said
speaking
in
that
paternal
fashion
in
which
one
small
boy
loves
to
address
another
weel
ma
little
lad
yo
coomin
along
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
the
better
to
criticise
his
subject
but
andrew
like
all
the
moores
slow
of
speech
preserved
a
stolid
silence
sucking
a
chubby
thumb
and
regarding
his
patron
a
thought
cynically
david
resented
the
expression
on
the
boy
countenance
and
half
rose
to
his
feet
yo
put
another
face
on
yo
andrew
moore
he
cried
threateningly
or
i
put
it
for
maggie
however
interposed
opportunely
did
yo
feyther
beat
yo
last
night
she
inquired
in
a
low
voice
and
there
was
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
the
soft
brown
eyes
nay
the
boy
answered
he
was
to
but
he
never
did
drunk
he
added
in
explanation
what
was
he
goin
to
beat
yo
for
david
asked
moore
what
for
why
for
the
fun
to
see

squiggle
the
boy
replied
and
laughed
bitterly
yo
shouldna
speak
so
o
your
dad
david
reproved
the
other
as
severely
as
was
in
her
nature
dad
a
fine
dad
i
dad

an
i
the
chance
the
boy
muttered
beneath
his
breath

conversation

he
said
and
going
to
the
door
bob
owd
bob
lad
coomin
along
he
called
the
gray
dog
came
springing
up
like
an
antelope
and
the
three
started
off
for
school
together
moore
stood
in
the
doorway
holding
andrew
by
the
hand
and
watched
the
departing
trio
is
a
pretty
pair
master
surely
she
said
softly
to
her
husband
who

up
at
the
moment

a
fine
lad
if

fether
let
him
the
tall
man

shame

a
life
the
woman
continued
indignantly
she
laid
a
hand
on
her
husband
arm
and
looked
up
at
him
coaxingly
could
yo
not
say
summat
to
un
master

to
you
she
pleaded
for
moore
imagined
that
there

gladly
heed
what
james
moore
master
of
kenmuir
might
say
to
him
he

a
bad
un
at
bottom
i
do
believe
she
continued
he
never

was
main
fond
o
her
husband

his
head
nay

he
said
nob
but
mak
it
worse
for
t

to
no
one
let
alone
and
indeed
he
was
right
for
the
tenant
of
the
grange
made
no
secret
of
his
animosity
for
his
neighbor
owd
bob
in
the
mean
time
had
escorted
the
children
to
the
bordering
on
the
lane
which
leads
to
the
village
now
he
crept
stealthily
back
to
the
yard
and
established
himself
behind
the
how
he
played
and
how
he
laughed
how
he
teased
old
whitecap
till
that
gray
gander
all
but
expired
of
apoplexy
and
impotence
how
he
ran
the
roan
and
aroused
the
bitter
wrath
of
a
portly
sow
mother
of
many
is
of
no
account
at
last
in
the
midst
of
his
merry
a
stern
voice
arrested
him
bob
lad
i
see
is
time
we
larned
you
yo
so
the
business
of
life
began
for
that

a
lonely
country
that
about

parson
leggy

will
tell
you
that
his
is
the
smallest
church
in
the
biggest
parish
north
of
the
derwent
and
that
his
cure
numbers
more
square
miles
than
parishioners
of
fells
and
ghylls
it
consists
of
becks
and
lakes
with
here
a
scattered
hamlet
and
there
a
solitary
hill
it
is
a
country
in
which
sheep
are
paramount
and
every
other
dalesman
is
engaged
in
that
profession
which
is
as
old
as
abel
and
the
talk
of
the
men
of
the
land
is
of
wethers
and
gimmers
of
ewe
tegs
in
wool
and
other
things
which
are
but
fearsome
names
to
you
and
me
and
always
of

misdoings

of

moorland
on
the

is
that
twin
dale
where
flows
the
gentle
silver

it
is
there
in
the
paddocks
at
the
back
of

in

late
summer
months
the
famous

that
hollow
shuddering
with
gloomy
possibilities
aptly
called
the
devil
bowl
in
its
centre
the
lone
tarn
weirdly
suggestive
pool
lifts
its
still
face
to

black
frozen

swirling

came
upon

who

every
one
who

heard
of

shepherd
trophy
and
who
has
not
knows
their
fame
in
that
country
of
good
dogs
and
jealous
masters
the
pride
of
place
has
long
been
held
unchallenged
whatever
line

the

bible
at

end
you
will
find
a
loose
sheet
the
pedigree
of

gray
dogs
at

pasted
on

inside
an
almost
similar
sheet
long
since
yellow
with

the

register
of
the
moores
of
kenmuir
running
your
eye
down
the
loose
leaf
once
twice
and
again
it
will
be
caught
by
a
small
red
cross
beneath
a
name
and
under
the
cross
the
one
word
lastly
opposite
the
name
of
rex
son
of
rally
are
two
of
those
proud
marks
the
cup
referred
to
is
the
renowned
dale
cup
champion
challenge
dale
cup
open
to
the
world
had
rex
won
it
but
once
again
the
shepherds
trophy
which
many
men
have
lived
to
win
and
died
still
striving
after
would
have
come
to
rest
forever
in
the
little
gray
house
below
the
pike
it
was
not
to
be
however
comparing
the
two
sheets
you
read
beneath
the
dog
name
a
date
and
a
pathetic
legend
and
on
the
other
sheet
written
in
his
son
boyish
hand
beneath
the
name
of
andrew
moore
the
same
date
and
the
same
legend
from
that
day
james
moore
then
but
a
boy
was
master
of
kenmuir
so
past
grip
and
rex
and
rally
and
a
hundred
others
until
at
the
foot
of
the
page
you
come
to
that
last
name
bob
son
of
battle
from
the
very
first
the
young
dog
took
to
his
work
in
a
manner
to
amaze
even
james
moore
for
a
while
he
watched
his
mother
meg
at
her
business
and
with
that
seemed
to
have
mastered
the
essentials
of
sheep
tactics
rarely
had
such
fiery
élan
been
seen
on
the
sides
of
the
pike
and
with
it
the
young
dog
combined
a
strange
sobriety
an
admirable
patience
that
justified
indeed
the
epithet
silent
he
worked
and
resolute
and
even
in
those
days
had
that
famous
trick
of
coaxing
the
sheep
to
do
his
wishes
blending
in
short
as
tammas
put
it
the
brains
of
a
man
with
the
way
of
a
woman
parson
leggy
who
was
reckoned
the
best
judge
of
a
sheep
or
tyne
and
tweed
summed
him
up
in
the
one
word
and
james
moore
himself
cautious
man
was
more
than
pleased
in
the
village
the
dalesmen
who
took
a
personal
pride
in
the
gray
dogs
of
kenmuir
began
to
nod
sage
heads
when
oor
bob
was
mentioned
jim
mason
the
postman
whose
word
went
as
far
with
the
villagers
as
parson
leggy
with
the
gentry
reckoned
he
never
seen
a
young
un
as
so
took
his
fancy
that
winter
it
grew
quite
the
recognized
thing
when
they
had
gathered
of
a
night
round
the
fire
in
the
sylvester
arms
with
tammas
in
the
centre
old
jonas
maddox
on
his
right
rob
saunderson
of
the
holt
on
the
left
and
the
others
radiating
away
toward
the
sides
for
some
one
to
begin
with
well
and
what
o
oor
bob
thornton
to
which
tammas
would
always
make
reply
oh
yo
ask
there
he
tell
yo
me
and
would
forthwith
plunge
himself
into
a
yarn
and
the
way
in
which
as
the
story
proceeded
tupper
of
swinsthwaite
winked
at
ned
hoppin
of
fellsgarth
and
long
kirby
the
smith
poked
jem
burton
the
publican
in
the
ribs
and
sexton
ross
said
ma
word
lad
spoke
more
eloquently
than
many
words
one
man
only
never
joined
in
the
chorus
of
admiration
sitting
always
alone
in
the
background
little
would
listen
with
an
incredulous
grin
on
his
sallow
face
oh
ma
certes
the
devil
in
the
dog
it
no
cannie
ava
he
would
continually
exclaim
as
tammas
told
his
tale
in
the
daleland
you
rarely
see
a
stranger
face
wandering
in
the
wild
country
about
the
twin
dales
at
the
time
of
this
story
you
might
have
met
parson
leggy
striding
along
with
a
couple
of
varmint
terriers
at
his
heels
and
young
cyril
gilbraith
whom
he
was
teaching
to
tie
flies
and
fear
god
beside
him
or
jim
mason
postman
by
profession
poacher
by
predilection
honest
man
and
sportsman
by
nature
hurrying
along
with
the
on
his
shoulder
a
rabbit
in
his
pocket
and
the
faithful
betsy
a
yard
behind
besides
these
you
might
have
hit
upon
a
quiet
shepherd
and
a
dog
squire
sylvester
going
his
rounds
upon
a
sturdy
cob
or
had
you
been
lucky
sweet
lady
eleanour
bent
upon
some
errand
of
mercy
to
one
of
the
many
tenants
it
was
while
the
squire
lady
was
driving
through
the
village
on
a
to
tammas
slobbering
grandson
it
was
shortly
after
billy
thornton
advent
into
the
world
that
little
standing
in
the
door
of
the
sylvester
arms
with
a
twig
in
his
mouth
and
a
sneer
fading
from
his
lips
made
his
remark
sall
he
said
speaking
in
low
earnest
voice
is
a
muckle
note
it
was
this
visit
which
figured
in
the
local
and
radical
under
the
heading
of
alleged
wholesale
corruption
by
tory
and
that
is
why
on
the
following
market
day
herbert
trotter
journalist
erstwhile
gentleman
and
secretary
of
the
dale
trials
found
himself
trying
to
swim
in
the
public
what
what
be
sayin
mon
cried
old
jonas
startled
out
of
his
usual
apathy
turned
sharply
on
the
old
man
i
said
the
wumman
wears
a
muckle
hat
he
snapped
blotted
out
as
it
was
the
observation
still
remains
a
tribute
of
honest
admiration
doubtless
the
recording
angel
did
not
pass
it
by
that
one
statement
anent
the
gentle
lady
of
the
manor
is
the
only
personal
remark
ever
credited
to
little
not
born
of
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
and
that
is
why
it
is
ever
memorable
the
little
scotsman
with
the
sardonic
face
had
been
the
tenant
of
the
grange
these
many
years
yet
he
had
never
grown
acclimatized
to
the
land
of
the
southron
with
his
shrivelled
body
and
weakly
legs
he
looked
among
the
sturdy
sons
of
the
like
some
brown
wrinkled
leaf
holding
its
place
midst
a
galaxy
of
green
and
as
he
differed
from
them
physically
so
he
did
morally
he
neither
understood
them
nor
attempted
to
the
character
was
an
unsolved
mystery
to
him
and
that
after
ten
years
study
o
what
ye
say
they
doot
and
they
let
ye
see
it
half
they
disbelieve
and
they
tell
ye
so
he
once
said
and
that
explained
his
attitude
toward
them
and
consequently
theirs
toward
him
he
stood
entirely
alone
a
son
of
hagar
mocking
his
sharp
ill
tongue
was
rarely
still
and
always
bitter
there
was
hardly
a
man
in
the
land
from
langholm
how
to
the
in
but
had
at
one
time
known
its
sting
endured
it
in
silence
for
they
are
slow
of
speech
these
men
of
the
fells
and
meres
and
was
nursing
his
resentment
till
a
day
should
bring
that
chance
which
always
comes
and
when
at
the
sylvester
arms
on
one
of
those
rare
occasions
when
was
not
present
tammas
summed
up
the
little
man
in
that
historic
phrase
of
his
when
he
drunk
he
and
when
he
bai
he
wicious
there
was
an
applause
to
gratify
the
blasé
heart
of
even
tammas
thornton
yet
it
had
not
been
till
his
wife
death
that
the
little
man
had
allowed
loose
rein
to
his
with
her
firmly
gentle
hand
no
longer
on
the
tiller
of
his
life
it
burst
into
fresh
being
and
alone
in
the
world
with
david
the
whole
venom
of
his
vicious
temperament
was
ever
directed
against
the
boy
head
it
was
as
though
he
saw
in
his
son
the
unconscious
cause
of
his
sorrow
all
the
more
strange
this
seeing
that
during
her
life
the
boy
had
been
to
poor
flora
as
her
heart
core
and
the
lad
was
growing
up
the
very
antithesis
of
his
father
big
and
hearty
with
never
an
ache
or
ill
in
the
whole
of
his
sturdy
young
body
of
frank
open
countenance
while
even
his
speech
was
slow
and
burring
like
any
boy
and
the
fact
of
it
all
and
that
the
lad
was
palpably
more
englishman
than
scot
ay
and
gloried
in
it
exasperated
the
little
man
a
patriot
before
everything
to
blows
while
on
top
of
it
david
evinced
an
amazing
pertness
fit
to
have
tried
a
better
man
than
adam
on
the
death
of
his
wife
kindly
elizabeth
moore
had
more
than
once
offered
such
help
to
the
lonely
little
man
as
a
woman
only
can
give
in
a
house
that
knows
no
mistress
on
the
last
of
these
occasions
after
crossing
the
stony
bottom
which
divides
the
two
farms
and
toiling
up
the
hill
to
the
grange
she
had
met
in
the
door
yo
maun
let
me
put
yo
bit
things
straight
for
yo
mister
she
had
said
shyly
for
she
feared
the
little
man
thank
ye
moore
he
had
answered
with
the
sour
smile
the
dalesmen
knew
so
well
but
ye
maun
think
i
a
waefu
and
there
he
had
stood
grinning
sardonically
opposing
his
small
bulk
in
the
very
centre
of
the
door
moore
had
turned
down
the
hill
abashed
and
hurt
at
the
reception
of
her
offer
and
her
husband
proud
to
a
fault
had
forbidden
her
to
repeat
it
nevertheless
her
motherly
heart
went
out
in
a
great
tenderness
for
the
little
orphan
david
she
knew
well
the
desolateness
of
his
life
his
father
aversion
from
him
and
its
inevitable
consequences
it
became
an
institution
for
the
boy
to
call
every
morning
at
kenmuir
and
trot
off
to
the
village
school
with
maggie
moore
and
soon
the
lad
came
to
look
on
kenmuir
as
his
true
home
and
james
and
elizabeth
moore
as
his
real
parents
his
greatest
happiness
was
to
be
away
from
the
grange
and
the
little
man
there
noted
the
fact
bitterly
resented
it
and
vented
his
accordingly
it
was
this
as
he
deemed
it
trespassing
on
his
authority
which
was
the
chief
cause
of
his
animosity
against
james
moore
the
master
of
kenmuir
it
was
at
whom
he
was
aiming
when
he
remarked
one
day
at
the
arms
masel
i
aye
prefaire
the
good
man
who
does
no
go
to
church
to
the
bad
man
who
does
but
then
as
ye
say
burton
the
little
man
treatment
of
david
exaggerated
as
it
was
by
eager
credulity
became
at
length
such
a
scandal
to
the
dale
that
parson
leggy
determined
to
bring
him
to
task
on
the
matter
now
was
the
parson
pet
antipathy
the
bluff
old
minister
with
his
brusque
manner
and
big
heart
would
have
no
truck
with
the
man
who
never
went
to
church
was
perpetually
in
liquor
and
never
spoke
good
of
his
neighbors
yet
he
entered
upon
the
interview
fully
resolved
not
to
be
betrayed
into
an
unworthy
expression
of
feeling
rather
to
appeal
to
the
little
man
better
nature
the
conversation
had
not
been
in
progress
two
minutes
however
before
he
knew
that
where
he
had
meant
to
be
calmly
persuasive
he
was
fast
become
hotly
abusive
you
hornbut
wi
james
moore
to
help
ye
look
after
the
soul
i
see
to
his
body
the
little
man
was
saying
the
parson
thick
gray
eyebrows
lowered
threateningly
over
his
eyes
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
talk
like
that
which
think
the
more
important
soul
or
body
ought
you
his
father
to
be
the
very
first
to
care
for
the
boy
soul
if
not
who
should
answer
me
the
little
man
stood
smirking
and
sucking
his
eternal
twig
entirely
unmoved
by
the
other
heat
ye
right
hornbut
as
ye
aye
are
but
my
argiment
is
this
that
i
get
at
his
soul
best
through
his
leetle
the
honest
parson
brought
down
his
stick
with
an
angry
thud
you
a
brute
a
brute
he
shouted
at
which
outburst
the
little
man
was
seized
with
a
spasm
of
silent
merriment
a
fond
dad
first
a
brute
afterward

he
ah
hornbut
ye
me
vast
diversion

do
indeed

my
honored
if
you
paid
as
much
heed
to
your
boy
welfare
as
you
do
to
the
bad
poetry
of
that
profligate
ploughman

angry
gleam
shot
into
the
other
eyes
d
ken
what
blasphemy
is
hornbut
he
asked
shouldering
a
pace
forward
for
the
first
time
in
the
dispute
the
parson
thought
he
was
about
to
score
a
point
and
was
calm
accordingly
i
should
do
i
fancy
i
a
specimen
of
the
breed
before
me
now
and
know
what
impertinence
is
i
should
do
i
fancy
i
i
awd
say
it
what
gentlemen
aften
are
unless
their
mammies
whipped
as
for
a
moment
the
parson
looked
as
if
about
to
seize
his
opponent
and
shake
him
he
roared
i
not
stand
your
insolences
the
little
man
turned
scuttled
indoors
and
came
running
back
with
a
chair
permit
me
he
said
blandly
holding
it
before
him
like
a
haircutter
for
a
customer
the
parson
turned
away
at
the
gap
in
the
hedge
he
paused
i
only
say
one
thing
more
he
called
slowly
when
your
wife
whom
i
think
we
all
loved
lay
dying
in
that
room
above
you
she
said
to
you
in
my
presence
it
was
turn
to
be
angry

made
a
step
forward
with
burning
face
aince
and
for

cried
passionately

standing
in
front
of
his
house
with
flushed
face
and
big
eyes
the
little
man
looked
almost
noble
in
his
indignation
and
the
parson
striding
away
down
the
hill
was
uneasily
conscious
that

him

to

is
like
a
ship
without

and
felt
his
loss
practically
as
well
as
otherwise
especially
did
he
experience
this
on
a
day
when
he
had
to
take
a
batch
of
over
to
to
help
him

burton
had
lent
the
services
of
his
greyhound
lurcher
monkey
but
before
they
had
well
topped
braithwaite
brow
which
leads
from
the
village
on
to

marches
was
standing
in
the
track
with
a
rock
in
his
hand
a
smile
on
his
face
and
the
tenderest
blandishments
in
his
voice
as
he
coaxed
the

to
him

knew
too
much
for
that
however
after
gamboling
a
while
longer
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
a
boulder
better
aimed
than
its
predecessors
smote
him
on
the
hinder
parts
and
sent
him
back
to
the
sylvester
arms
with
a
sore
tail
and
a
subdued
heart
for
the
rest
would
never
have
won
over
the
marches
alone
with
his
convoy
had
it
not
been
for
the
help
of
old
saunderson
and
shep
who
caught
him
on
the
way
and
aided
him
it
was
in
a
very
wrathful
mood
that
on
his
way
home
he
turned
into
the
dalesman
daughter
in
silverdale
the
only
occupants
of
the
as
he
entered
were

the
publican

with
the
faithful
betsy
beneath

the
little
man

round
all
in
a

what
he
cried
in
eagerness
scanning
the
yellow
mongrel
beneath
the
chair
betsy
for

where
ma
whereat
jim
most
easily
snubbed
of
men
collapsed
took
off
his
dripping
coat
and
crossed
the
room
to
hang
it
on
a
the
stranger
drover
followed
the
meagre
figure
with
shifty
eyes
then
he
buried
his
face
in
his
mug
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
chair
and
as
he
did
so
a
bomb
in
yellow
leapt
out
from
beneath
it
and
growling
horribly
attacked
his
ankles
curse
ye
cried
starting
back
ye
devil
let
me
alone
then
turning
fiercely
on
the
drover

asked

at
which
teddy

sniggering
and
jim
mason
slung
the
on
to
his
shoulder
and
plunged
out
into
the
rain
the
faithful
betsy
following
disconsolate
the
cause
of
the
squall
having
beaten
off
the
attacking
force
had
withdrawn
again
beneath
its
chair
stooped
down
still
cursing
his
wet
coat
on
his
arm
and
beheld
a
tiny
yellow
puppy
crouching
defiant
in
the
dark
and
glaring
out
with
fiery
light
eyes
seeing
itself
remarked
it
bared
its
little
teeth
raised
its
little
bristles
and
growled
a
hideous
menace
a
sense
of
humor
is
many
a
man
salvation
and
was
one
redeeming
feature
the
laughableness
of
the
thing
this
ferocious
atomy
defying
him
struck
home
to
the
little
man
delighted
at
such
a
display
of
vice
in
so
tender
a
plant
he
fell
to
chuckling
ye
leetle
devil
he
laughed
he
he
ye
leetle
devil
and
flipped
together
finger
and
thumb
in
vain
endeavor
to
coax
the
puppy
to
him
but
it
growled
and
glared
more
terribly
stop
it
ye
little
snake
or
i
flatten
you
cried
the
big
drover
and
shuffled
his
feet
threateningly
whereat
the
puppy
gurgling
like
hot
water
in
a
kettle
made
a
feint
as
though
to
advance
and
wipe
them
out
these
two
bad
men
laughed
again
and
smote
his
leg
keep
a
ceevil
tongue
and
yer
distance
says
he
or
i
ha
to
mak
ye
though
he
is
but
as
big
as
a
man
thumb
a
dog
a
dog
for
a
that
he
he
the
leetle
and
he
fell
to
flipping
finger
and
thumb
afresh
ye
maybe
wantin
a
dog
inquired
the
stranger
yer
friend
said
as
ma
friend
lied

replied
i
willin
to

wi
him
the

pursued
the
little
man
yawned
weel
i
tak

said
indifferently
the
drover
rose
to
his
feet
it
givin
ye

givin
im
ye
mind
but
i
do
it
he
smacked
a
great
fist
into
a
hollow
palm
ye
may
have
the
dog
for
a
pun
i
only
ask
a
pun
and
he
walked
away
to
the
window
drew
back
the
better
to
scan
his
benefactor
his
lower
jaw
dropped
and
he
eyed
the
stranger
with
a
drolly
sarcastic
air
a
poun
man
a
pouxi
for
yon
noble
dorg
he
pointed
a
crooked
forefinger
at
the
little
creature
whose
scowling
mask
peered
from
beneath
the
chair
man
i
couldna
do
it
na
na
ma
conscience
wadna
permit
me
be
fair
robbin
ye
ah
ye
englishmen
he
spoke
half
to
himself
and
sadly
as
if
deploring
the
unhappy
accident
of
his
nationality
it
yer
grand
generosity
that
grips
a
puir
scotsman
by
the
throat
a
poun
and
for
yon
he
wagged
his
head
mournfully
cocking
it
sideways
the
better
to
scan
his
subject
take
him
or
leave
him
ordered
the
drover
truculently
still
gazing
out
of
the
window
wi
yer
permission
i
leave
him
answered
meekly
i
short
o
the
ready
the
big
man
pursued
or
i
wouldna
part
with
him
could
i
bide
me
time
there
many
be
glad
to
give
me
a
tenner
for
one
o
that
bree
he
caught
himself
up
hastily
for
a
dog
sic
as
and
yet
ye
offer
him
me
for
a
poun
noble
indeed
nevertheless
the
little
man
had
pricked
his
ears
at
the
other
slip
and
quick
correction
again
he
approached
the
puppy
dangling
his
coat
before
him
to
protect
his
ankles
and
again
that
wee
wild
beast
sprang
out
seized
the
coat
in
its
small
jaw
and
worried
it
savagely
stooped
quickly
and
picked
up
his
tiny
assailant
and
the
puppy
suspended
by
its
neck
gurgled
and
slobbered
then
wriggling
desperately
round
made
its
teeth
meet
in
its
adversary
shirt
at
which
shook
it
gently
and
laughed
then
he
set
to
examining
it
apparently
some
six
weeks
old
a
tawny
coat
fiery
eyes
a
square
head
with
small
cropped
ears
and
a
comparatively
immense
jaw
the
whole
giving
promise
of
great
strength
if
little
beauty
and
this
effect
was
enhanced
by
the
manner
of
its
docking
for
the
miserable
relic
of
a
tail
yet
raw
looked
little
more
than
a
red
button
adhering
to
its
wearer
stern
inspection
was
as
minute
as
it
was
apparently
absorbing
he
omitted
nothing
from
the
square
muzzle
to
the
scut
and
every
now
and
then
he
threw
a
quick
glance
at
the
man
at
the
window
who
was
watching
the
careful
scrutiny
a
thought
uneasily
ye
cut
him
short
he
said
at
length
swinging
round
on
the
drover
ay
strengthens
their
backs
the
big
man
answered
with
averted
gaze
chin
went
up
in
the
air
his
mouth
partly
opened
and
his
eyelids
partly
closed
as
he
eyed
his
informant
oh
ay
he
said
gie
him
back
to
me
ordered
the
drover
surlily
he
took
the
puppy
and
set
it
on
the
floor
whereupon
it
immediately
resumed
its
former
fortified
position
ye
no
buyer
i
knoo
that
all
along
by
that
face
on

he
said
in
insulting
tones

answered
the
other
a
smile
of
genuine
pleasure
stole
over
face
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
other
arm
man
he
said
gently
ye

then
almost
in

breath

but

ye
may
believe
the
great
fellow
advanced
to
the
chair
under
which
the
puppy
lay
it
leapt
out
like
a
lion
and
fastened
on
his
huge
boot
a
rare

he
shook
his
booted
foot
fiercely
tossing
his
leg
to
and
fro
like
a
tree
in
a
wind
but
the
little
creature
now
raised
ceilingward
now
dashed
to
the
ground
held
on
with
incomparable
doggedness
till
its
small
jaw
was
all
bloody
and

wrinkled
with
the
effort

that
do
interposed
irritably
the
drover
ceased
his
efforts
now
i

thrust
his

down
to

with

as
the
puppy
retreated
to
its
chair
leaving
a
spotted
track
of
red
along
its
route
ay

wadna

thocht
he
no

then
he
put

the

scornfully
there
niver

the

shoved

down

and
he
stepped
out
into
the
rain
it
was
long
after
dark
when
the
bargain
was
finally
struck
adam
red
wull
became
that
little
man
property
for
the
following
realizable
assets
ninepence
in
cash
three
coppers
and
a
doubtful
sixpence
a
plug
of
suspicious
tobacco
in
a
pouch
and
an
old
watch

sae
leeberal
the
other
answered
gently
i
wad
not
like
to
see
ye
thank
ye
kindly
the
big
man
replied
with
some
acerbity
and
plunged
out
into
the
darkness
and
rain
nor
was
that
ever
again
seen
in
the
countryside
and
the
puppy
previous
history
whether
he
was
honestly
come
by
or
no
whether
he
was
indeed
of
the
famous
red
strain
ever
remained
a
mystery
in
the
daleland
you
may
know
a
red
mcculloch
anywhere
by
the
ring
of
white
upon
his
tail
some
two
inches
from
the
root
chapter
iv
first
blood
after
that
first
encounter
in
the
dalesman
daughter
red
wull
for
so
called
him
resigned
himself
complacently
to
his
lot
recognizing
perhaps
his
destiny
thenceforward
the
sour
little
man
and
the
vicious
puppy
grew
as
it
were
together
the
two
were
never
apart
where
was
there
was
sure
to
be
his
tiny
attendant
bristling
defiance
as
he
kept
ludicrous
guard
over
his
master
the
little
man
and
his
dog
were
inseparable
never
left
him
even
at
the
grange
i
couldna
trust
ma
wullie
at
hame
alone
wi
the
dear
lad
was
his
explanation
i
ken
weel
i
come
back
to
find
a
wee
corpse
on
the
floor
and
david
singin
heart
is
sair
i
daur
na
tell
my
heart
is
sair
for
somebody
ay
and
he
be
sair
elsewhere
by
the
time
i
done
wi
him
he
he
the
sneer
at
david
expense
was
as
characteristic
as
it
was
unjust
for
though
the
puppy
and
the
boy
were
already
sworn
enemies
yet
the
lad
would
have
scorned
to
harm
so
small
a
foe
and
many
a
tale
did
david
tell
at
kenmuir
of
red
wull
viciousness
of
his
hatred
of
him
david
and
his
devotion
to
his
master
how
whether
immersed
in
the
or
chasing
the
fleeting
rabbit
he
would
desist
at
once
and
bundle
panting
up
at
his
master
call
how
he
routed
the
tomcat
and
drove
him
from
the
kitchen
and
how
he
clambered
on
to
david
bed
and
pinned
him
murderously
by
the
nose
of
late
the
relations
between
and
james
moore
had
been
unusually
strained
though
they
were
neighbors
communications
between
the
two
were
of
the
rarest
and
it
was
for
the
first
time
for
many
a
long
day
that
on
an
afternoon
shortly
after
red
wull
had
come
into
his
possession
entered
the
yard
of
kenmuir
bent
on
girding
at
the
master
for
an
alleged
trespass
at
the
stony
bottom
wi
yer
permission
moore
said
the
little
man
i
wheestle
ma
dog
and
turning
he
whistled
a
shrill
peculiar
note
like
the
cry
of
a
disturbed
peewit
straightway
there
came
scurrying
desperately
up
ears
back
head
down
tongue
out
as
if
the
world
depended
on
his
speed
a
little
tawny
beetle
of
a
thing
who
placed
his
forepaws
against
his
master
ankles
and
looked
up
into
his
face
then
catching
sight
of
the
strangers
hurriedly
he
took
up
his
position
between
them
and
assuming
his
natural
attitude
of
grisly
defiance
such
a
laughable
spectacle
he
made
that
martial
mite
standing
at
bay
with
bristles
up
and
teeth
bared
that
even
james
moore
smiled
ma
word
ha
yo
brought
his
muzzle
man
cried
old
tammas
the
humorist
and
turning
climbed
all
in
a
heat
on
to
an
upturned
bucket
that
stood
by
whereat
the
puppy
emboldened
by
his
foe
retreat
advanced
savagely
to
the
attack
buzzing
round
the
slippery
pail
like
a
wasp
on
a
windowpane
in
a
vain
attempt
to
reach
the
old
man
tammas
stood
on
the
top
hitching
his
trousers
and
looking
down
on
his
assailant
the
picture
of
mortal
fear
oh
he
bawled
send
for
the
sogers
fetch
the
for
sake
call
him
off
man
even
todd
watching
the
scene
from
the
was
tickled
and
burst
into
a
loud
guffaw
heartily
backed
by
and
oor
job
while
remarked
fitter
for
a
stage
than
a
how
didst
come
by
him
asked
tammas
nodding
at
the
puppy
found
him
the
little
man
replied
sucking
his
twig
found
him
in
ma
stockin
on
ma
birthday
a
present
from
ma
leetle
david
for
his
auld
dad
i
so
do
i
said
tammas
and
was
seized
with
sudden
spasm
of
seemingly
causeless
merriment
for
looking
up
as
was
speaking
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
boy
fair
head
peering
cautiously
round
the
and
behind
the
flutter
of
short
petticoats
they
disappeared
as
silently
as
they
had
come
and
two
small
figures
just
returned
from
school
glided
away
and
sought
shelter
in
the
friendly
darkness
of
a
coom
awa
maggie
coom
awa
is
th
owd
un
whispered
a
disrespectful
voice
looked
round
suspiciously
what
that
he
asked
sharply
at
the
moment
however
moore
put
her
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
coom
thy
ways
in
mister
and
tak
a
soop
o
tea
she
called
hospitably
thank
ye
kindly
moore
i
will
he
answered
politely
for
him
and
this
one
good
thing
must
be
allowed
of
adam
that
if
there
was
only
one
woman
of
whom
he
was
ever
known
to
speak
well
there
was
also
only
one
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
against
whom
he
ever
insinuated
evil
and
that
was
years
afterward
when
men
said
his
brain
was
sapped
flouts
and
jeers
he
had
for
every
man
but
a
woman
good
or
bad
was
sacred
to
him
for
the
sex
that
had
given
him
his
mother
and
his
wife
he
had
that
sentiment
of
tender
reverence
which
if
a
man
still
preserve
he
can
not
be
altogether
bad
as
he
turned
into
the
house
he
looked
back
at
red
wull
ay
we
may
leave
him
he
said
that
is
gin
ye
no
afraid
thornton
of
what
happened
while
the
men
were
within
doors
it
is
enough
to
tell
two
things
first
that
owd
bob
was
no
bully
second
this
in
the
code
of
honor
there
is
written
a
word
in
stark
black
letters
and
opposite
it
another
word
writ
large
in
the
color
of
blood
the
first
is
the
second
it
is
the
one
crime
only
to
be
wiped
away
in
blood
and
to
accuse
of
the
crime
is
to
offer
the
one
unpardonable
insult
every
knows
it
and
every
shepherd
that
afternoon
as
the
men
still
talked
the
quiet
echoes
of
the
farm
rung
with
a
furious
animal
cry
twice
repeated
shot
for
shot
for
followed
by
a
hollow
stillness
the
two
men
finished
their
colloquy
the
matter
was
concluded
peacefully
mainly
owing
to
the
pacifying
influence
of
moore
together
the
three
went
out
into
the
yard
moore
seizing
the
opportunity
to
shyly
speak
on
david
behalf
he
such
a
good
little
lad
i
do
think
she
was
saying
ye
should
ken
moore
the
little
man
answered
a
thought
bitterly
ye
see
enough
of
yo
mun
be
main
proud
of
un
mester
the
woman
continued
heedless
of
the
sneer
an
growin
such
a
gradely
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
barely
ken
the
lad
he
said
by
sight
i
know
him
of
course
but
barely
to
speak
to
he
but
seldom
at
an
hoo
proud
his
mother
be
if
she
could
see
him
the
woman
continued
well
aware
of
his
one
tender
place
eh
but
she
was
fond
him
so
she
an
angry
flush
stole
over
the
little
man
face
well
he
understood
the
implied
rebuke
and
it
hurt
him
like
a
knife
ay
ay
moore
he
began
then
breaking
off
and
looking
about
him
where
ma
wullie
he
cried
excitedly

he
turned
sorrowfully
to
that
little
man
all
dishevelled
and
with
the
perspiration
standing
on
his
face
came
hurrying
out
of
the
and
danced
up
to

the

coldly
noo
the
big
man
shifted
his

on
the

with
the
resignation
of

he
cried
piteously

the
master
encouragingly

but
yon
girt
tossed
his
head
and
snorted
coom
then
and
i
show
yo
he
said
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
yard
and
there
below
them
on
the
slope
to
the
stream
sitting
like
justice
at
the
courts
of
law
was
owd
bob
straightway
whose
humor
was
something
of
the
calibre
of
old
ross
the
sexton
burst
into
why
he
sittin
so
still
think
ho
ho
see
un
lickin

and
he
roared
afresh
while
from
afar
you
could
hear
the
distant
rumbling
of
and
oor
job
at
the
sight
burst
into
a
storm
of
passionate
invective
and
would
have
rushed
on
the
dog
had
not
james
moore
forcibly
restrained
him
bob
lad
called
the
master
coom
here
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
gray
dog
cocked
his
ears
listened
a
moment
and
then
shot
down
the
slope
at
the
same
moment
tammas
hallooed
theer
he
be
yon
yaller
un
coomin
oot
o

and
there
indeed
on
the
slope
below
them
a
little
angry
figure
was
crawling
out
of
a
ye
murderin
devil
wad
ye
duar
touch
ma
wullie
yelled
and
breaking
away
pursued
hotly
down
the
hill
for
the
gray
dog
had
picked
up
the
puppy
like
a
lancer
a
and
was
sweeping
on
his
captive
in
his
mouth
toward
the
stream
behind
hurried
james
moore
and
wondering
what
the
issue
of
the
comedy
would
be
after
them
toddled
old
tammas
chuckling
while
over
the
was
now
a
little
cluster
of
heads
oor
job
maggie
and
david
and
thornton
the
straight
on
to
the
galloped
owd
bob
in
the
middle
he
halted
leant
over
and
dropped
his
prisoner
who
fell
with
a
cool
plop
into
the
running
water
beneath
another
moment
and
had
reached
the
bank
of
the
stream
in
he
plunged
splashing
and
cursing
and
seized
the
struggling
puppy
then
waded
back
the
waters
surging
about
his
waist
and
red
wull
limp
as
a
wet
rag
in
his
hand
the
little
man
hair
was
dripping
for
his
cap
was
gone
his
clothes
clung
to
him
exposing
the
miserableness
of
his
figure
and
his
eyes
blazed
like
hot
ashes
in
his
wet
face
he
sprang
on
to
the
bank
and
beside
himself
with
passion
rushed
at
owd
bob
curse
ye
for
a
stan
back
or
yo
have
him
at
your
throat
shouted
the
master
thundering
up
stan
back
i
say
yo
fule
and
as
the
little
man
still
came
madly
on
he
reached
forth
his
hand
and
hurled
him
back
at
the
same
moment
bending
he
buried
the
other
hand
deep
in
owd
shaggy
neck
it
was
but
just
in
time
for
if
ever
the
fierce
desire
of
battle
gleamed
in
gray
eyes
it
did
in
the
young
dog
as
came
down
on
him
the
little
man
staggered
tottered
and
fell
heavily
at
the
shock
the
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
and
mixing
with
the
water
on
his
face
ran
down
in
vague
red
streams
dripping
off
his
chin
while
red
wull
jerked
from
his
grasp
was
thrown
afar
and
lay
motionless
curse
ye
screamed
his
face
save
for
the
running
red
about
his
jaw
curse
ye
for
a
cowardly
englishman
and
struggling
to
his
feet
he
made
at
the
master
but
interposed
his
great
bulk
between
the
two
easy
little
mon
he
said
leisurely
regarding
the
small
fury
before
him
with
mournful
interest
eh
but
thee
do
be
a
little
surely
james
moore
stood
breathing
deep
his
hand
still
buried
in
owd
coat
if
yo
touched
him
he
explained
i
couldna
ha
stopped
him
ha
mauled

afore
iver
i

years

the
little

turned
away
ye
all
agin
me
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
a
pitiful
figure
he
made
standing
there
with
the
water
dripping
from
him
a
red
stream
was
running
slowly
from
his
chin
his
head
was
bare
and
face
working
james
moore
stood
eyeing
him
with
some
pity
and
some
contempt
behind
was
tammas
enjoying
the
scene
while
regarded
them
all
with
an
impassive
melancholy
turned
and
bent
over
red
wull
who
still
lay
like
a
dead
thing
as
his
master
handled
him
the
quivered
feebly
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
about
him
snarled
faintly
and
glared
with
devilish
hate
at
the
gray
dog
and
the
group
with
him
the
little
man
picked
him
up
stroking
him
tenderly
then
he
turned
away
and
on
to
the
bridge
across
he
stopped
it
rattled
feverishly
beneath
him
for
he
still
trembled
like
a
palsied
man
man
moore
he
called
striving
to
quell
the
agitation
in
his
voice
i
wad
shoot
yon
across
the
bridge
he
turned
again
man
moore
he
called
and
paused
ye
not
forget
this
and
with
that
the
blood
flared
up
a
dull
crimson
into
his
white
face
part
ii
the
little
man
chapter
a
man
son
the
storm
long
threatened
having
once
burst
allowed
loose
rein
to
his
bitter
animosity
against
james
moore
the
two
often
met
for
the
little
man
frequently
returned
home
from
the
village
by
the
footpath
across
kenmuir
it
was
out
of
his
way
but
he
preferred
it
in
order
to
annoy
his
enemy
and
keep
a
watch
upon
his
doings
he
haunted
kenmuir
like
its
evil
genius
his
sallow
face
was
perpetually
turning
up
at
inopportune
moments
when
kenmuir
queen
the
prize
heifer
calved
unexpectedly
and
unattended
in
the
dip
by
the
lane
tammas
and
the
master
summoned
hurriedly
by
owd
bob
came
running
up
to
find
the
little
man
leaning
against
the
stile
and
shaking
with
silent
merriment
again
poor
old
staggy
daring
still
in
his
dotage
took
a
fall
while
scrambling
on
the
steep
banks
of
the
stony
bottom
there
he
lay
for
hours
unnoticed
and
kicking
until
james
moore
and
owd
bob
came
upon
him
at
length
nearly
exhausted
but
was
before
them
standing
on
the
far
bank
with
red
wull
by
his
side
he
called
across
the
gulf
with
apparent
concern
he
bin
so
sin
often
james
moore
with
all
his
great
strength
of
character
could
barely
control
himself
there
were
two
attempts
to
patch
up
the
feud
jim
mason
who
went
about
the
world
seeking
to
do
good
tried
in
his
shy
way
to
set
things
right
but
and
his
red
wull
between
them
soon
shut
him
and
betsy
up
you
mind
yer
letters
and
yer
wires
ay
i
saw
baith
th
ain
doon
by
the
haughs
in
the
bottom
and
wullie
the
humorsome
chiel
havin
a
rare
game
wi
there
indeed
lay
the
faithful
betsy
suppliant
on
her
back
paws
up
throat
exposed
while
red
wull
now
a
puppy
stood
over
her
his
habitually
evil
expression
intensified
into
a
fiendish
grin
as
with
wrinkled
muzzle
and
savage
wheeze
he
waited
for
a
movement
as
a
pretext
to
pin
wullie
let
the
leddy
be
ye
had
yer
parson
leggy
was
the
other
mediator
for
he
hated
to
see
the
two
principal
parishioners
of
his
tiny
cure
at
enmity
first
he
tackled
james
moore
on
the
subject
but
that
laconic
person
cut
him
short
with
i
nowt
agin
the
little
mon
and
would
say
no
more
and
indeed
the
quarrel
was
none
of
his
making
of
the
parson
interview
with
it
is
enough
to
say
here
that
in
the
end
the
angry
old
minister
would
of
a
surety
have
assaulted
his
mocking
adversary
had
not
cyril
gilbraith
forcibly
withheld
him
and
after
that
the
vendetta
must
take
its
course
unchecked
david
was
now
the
only
link
between
the
two
farms
despite
his
angry
commands
the
boy
clung
to
his
intimacy
with
the
moores
with
a
doggedness
that
no
thrashing
could
overcome
not
a
minute
of
the
day
when
out
of
school
holidays
and
sundays
included
but
was
passed
at
kenmuir
it
was
not
till
late
at
night
that
he
would
sneak
back
to
the
grange
and
creep
quietly
up
to
his
tiny
bare
room
in
the
roof
not
supperless
indeed
motherly
moore
had
seen
to
that
and
there
he
would
lie
awake
and
listen
with
a
fierce
contempt
as
his
father
hours
later
lurched
into
the
kitchen
below
lilting
liquorishly
we
are
na
fou
we
nae
that
fou
but
just
a
drappie
in
our
the
cock
may
craw
the
day
may
daw
and
ay
we
taste
the
barley
bree
and
in
the
morning
the
boy
would
slip
quietly
out
of
the
house
while
his
father
still
slept
only
red
wull
would
thrust
out
his
savage
head
as
the
lad
passed
and
snarl
hungrily
sometimes
father
and
son
would
go
thus
for
weeks
without
sight
of
one
another
and
that
was
david
aim
to
escape
attention
it
was
only
his
cunning
at
this
game
of
evasion
that
saved
him
a
thrashing
the
little
man
seemed
devoid
of
all
natural
affection
for
his
son
he
lavished
the
whole
fondness
of
which
his
small
nature
appeared
capable
on
the
tailless
tyke
for
so
the
dalesmen
called
red
wull
and
the
dog
he
treated
with
a
careful
tenderness
that
made
david
smile
bitterly
the
little
man
and
his
dog
were
as
alike
morally
as
physically
they
were
contrasted
each
owed
a
grudge
against
the
world
and
was
determined
to
pay
it
each
was
an
ishmael
among
his
kind
you
saw
them
thus
standing
apart
in
the
turmoil
of
life
and
it
came
quite
as
a
revelation
to
happen
upon
them
in
some
quiet
spot
of
nights
playing
together
each
wrapped
in
the
game
innocent
tender
forgetful
of
the
hostile
world
the
two
were
never
separated
except
only
when
came
home
by
the
path
across
kenmuir
after
that
first
misadventure
he
never
allowed
his
friend
to
accompany
him
on
the
journey
through
the
enemy
country
for
well
he
knew
that
have
long
memories
to
the
stile
in
the
lane
then
red
wull
would
follow
him
there
he
would
stand
his
great
head
poked
through
the
bars
watching
his
master
out
of
sight
and
then
would
turn
and
trot
and
defiant
sturdy
and
surly
down
the
very
centre
of
the
road
through
the
village
no
playing
no
enticing
away
and
woe
to
that
man
or
dog
who
tried
to
stay
him
in
his
course
and
so
on
past
mother
ross
shop
past
the
sylvester
arms
to
the
right
by
kirby
smithy
over
the
wastrel
by
the
haughs
to
await
his
master
at
the
edge
of
the
stony
bottom
the
little
man
when
thus
crossing
kenmuir
often
met
owd
bob
who
had
the
free
run
of
the
farm
on
these
occasions
he
passed
discreetly
by
for
though
he
was
no
coward
yet
it
is
bad
to
attack
a
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
while
the
dog
trotted
soberly
on
his
way
only
a
steely
glint
in
the
big
gray
eyes
betraying
his
knowledge
of
the
presence
of
his
foe
as
surely
however
as
the
little
man
in
his
desire
to
spy
out
the
nakedness
of
the
land
strayed
off
the
public
path
so
surely
a
gray
figure
seeming
to
spring
from
out
the
blue
would
come
fiercely
silently
driving
down
on
him
and
he
would
turn
and
run
for
his
life
amid
the
uproarious
jeers
of
any
of
the
who
were
witness
to
the
encounter
on
these
occasions
david
vied
with
tammas
in
facetiousness
at
his
father
expense
good
on
yo
little
un
he
roared
from
behind
a
wall
on
one
such
occurrence

for
you
to

at
to
be

o
serve
yo
right
if

does

yo
when

and
david
turning
round
found
james
moore
close
behind
him
his
heavy
eyebrows
lowering
over
his
eyes
luckily
had
not
distinguished
his
son
voice
among
the
others
but
david
feared
he
had
for
on
the
following
morning
the
little
man
said
to
him
david
ye
come
hame
immediately
after
school
will
i
said
david
pertly
will
why
because
i
tell
ye
to
ma
lad
and
that
was
all
the
reason
he
would
give
had
he
told
the
simple
fact
that
he
wanted
help
to
drench
a
husking
ewe
things
might
have
gone
differently
as
it
was
david
turned
away
defiantly
down
the
hill
the
afternoon
wore
on
schooltime
was
long
over
still
there
was
no
david
the
little
man
waited
at
the
door
of
the
grange
fuming
hopping
from
one
leg
to
the
other
talking
to
red
wull
who
lay
at
his
feet
his
head
on
his
paws
like
a
tiger
waiting
for
his
prey
at
length
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
and
started
running
down
the
hill
his
heart
burning
with
indignation
wait
till
we
lay
hands
on
ye
ma
lad
he
muttered
as
he
ran
warm
ye
we
teach
at
the
edge
of
the
stony
bottom
he
as
always
left
red
wull
crossing
it
himself
and
rounding
langholm
how
he
espied
james
moore
david
and
owd
bob
walking
away
from
him
and
in
the
direction
of
kenmuir
the
gray
dog
and
david
were
playing
together
wrestling
racing
and
rolling
the
boy
had
never
a
thought
for
his
father
the
little
man
ran
up
behind
them
unseen
and
unheard
his
feet
softly
pattering
on
the
grass
his
hand
had
fallen
on
david
shoulder
before
the
boy
had
guessed
his
approach
did
i
bid
ye
come
hame
after
school
david
he
asked
concealing
his
heat
beneath
a
suspicious
suavity
maybe
did
i
say
i
would
come
the
pertness
of
tone
and
words
alike
fanned
his
father
resentment
into
a
blaze
in
a
burst
of
passion
he
lunged
forward
at
the
boy
with
his
stick
but
as
he
smote
a
gray
whirlwind
struck
him
fair
on
the
chest
and
he
fell
like
a
snapped
stake
and
lay
half
stunned
with
a
dark
muzzle
an
inch
from
his
throat
git
back
bob
shouted
james
moore
hurrying
up
git

bent
over
the
prostrate
figure
propping

up
anxiously

but
i
am
sorry
he
thought
yo

going

david

now
run
up
and
he
too
bent
over
his
father
with
a
very
scared
face
are
yo
hurt
feyther
he
asked
his
voice
trembling
the
little
man
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
shook
off
his
supporters
his
face
was
twitching
and
he
stood
all
looking
at
his
son
ye
content
aiblins
noo
ye
seen

gray
head
bowed
in
the
dust
he
said

tho

a
sneer
on
his
face
ye

james
moore
he
said
i

david
turning
to
his
son
a
stranger
might
well
have
mistaken
the
identity
of
the
boy
father
for
he
stood
now
holding
the
master
arm
while
a
few
paces
above
them
was
the
little
man
pale
but
determined
the
expression
on
his
face
betraying
his
consciousness
of
the
irony
of
the
situation
will
ye
come
hame
wi
me
and
have
it
noo
or
stop
wi
him
and
wait
till
ye

he
asked
the
boy
i
like
yo
to
none
o
that
james
david
what
d
say
david
looked
up
into
his
protector
face
yo
best
go
wi
your
feyther
lad
said
the
master
at
last
thickly
the
boy
hesitated
and
clung
tighter
to
the
shielding
arm
then
he
walked
slowly
over
to
his
father
a
bitter
smile
spread
over
the
little
man
face
as
he
marked
this
new
test
of
the
boy
obedience
to
the
other
to
obey
his
frien
he
foregoes
the
pleasure
o
disobeyin
his
father
he
muttered
noble
then
he
turned
homeward
and
the
boy
followed
in
his
footsteps
james
moore
and
the
gray
dog
stood
looking
after
them
i
know
yo
not
pay
off
yer
spite
agin
me
on
the
lad
head
he
called
almost
appealingly
i
do
ma
duty
thank
ye
james
moore
respect
o
persons
the
little
man
cried
back
never
turning
father
and
son
walked
away
one
behind
the
other
like
a
man
and
his
dog
and
there
was
no
word
said
between
them
across
the
stony
bottom
red
wull
scowling
with
bared
teeth
at
david
joined
them
together
the
three
went
up
the
bill
to
the
grange
in
the
kitchen
turned
noo
i
gaein
to
gie

the
thrashin
ye
iver
dreamed
of

the
boy
obeyed
and
stood
up
in
his
thin
shirt
his
face
white
and
set
as
a
statue
red
wull
seated
himself
on
his
haunches
close
by
his
ears
pricked
licking
his
lips
all
attention
the
little
man
suppled
the
great
in
his
hands
and
raised
it
but
the
expression
on
the
boy
face
arrested
his
arm
say
ye
sorry

i
let

aff
i

mair
chance

o

i
the
little

brandished
his
cruel
white
weapon
and
red
wull
shifted
a
little
to
obtain
a
better
view
git
on
wi
it
ordered
david
angrily
the
little
man
raised
the
stick
again
and
threw
it
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
it
fell
with
a
rattle
on
the
floor
and
turned
away
ye
the
pitifulest
son
iver
a
man
had
he
cried
brokenly

ye
shall
stop

and
his
father
rare
emotion
his
broken
voice
and
working
face
moved
david
as
all
the
stripes
and
jeers
had
failed
to
do
his
conscience
smote
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
dimly
dawned
on
him
that
perhaps
his
father
too
had
some
ground
for
complaint
that
perhaps
he
was
not
a
good
son
he
half
turned
feyther
git
oot
o
ma
sight
cried
and
the
boy
turned
and
went
chapter
vi
a
licking
or
a
lie
thenceforward
david
buckled
down
to
work
at
home
and
in
one
point
only
father
and
son
resembled
industry
a
drunkard
was
but
a
drone
no
the
boy
worked
at
the
grange
with
tireless
indomitable
energy
yet
he
could
never
satisfy
his
father
the
little
man
would
stand
a
sneer
on
his
face
and
his
thin
lips
contemptuously
curled
and
flout
the
lad
brave
labors
is
he
no
a
gran
worker
wullie
is
a
pleasure
to
watch
him
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
turned
heavenward
as
the
boy
snatched
a
moment
rest
you
and
i
wullie
we
brak
slavin
for
him
while
he
looks
on
and
and
so
on
the
whole
day
through
week
in
week
out
till
he
sickened
with
weariness
of
it
all
in
his
darkest
hours
david
thought
sometimes
to
run
away
he
was
miserably
alone
on
the
cold
bosom
of
the
world
the
very
fact
that
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
isolated
him
in
the
daleland
naturally
of
a
reserved
disposition
he
had
no
single
friend
outside
kenmuir
and
it
was
only
the
thought
of
his
friends
there
that
withheld
him
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
part
from
them
they
were
all
he
had
in
the
world
so
he
worked
on
at
the
grange
miserably
doggedly
taking
blows
and
abuse
alike
in
burning
silence
but
every
evening
when
work
was
ended
he
stepped
off
to
his
other
home
beyond
the
stony
bottom
and
on
sundays
and
holidays
for
of
these
latter
he
took
unasking
what
he
knew
to
be
his
due
all
day
long
from
to
the
going
down
of
the
sun
he
would
pass
at
kenmuir
in
this
one
matter
the
boy
was
invincibly
stubborn
nothing
his
father
could
say
or
do
sufficed
to
break
him
of
the
habit
he
endured
everything
with
silent
doggedness
and
still
held
on
his
way
once
past
the
stony
bottom
he
threw
his
troubles
behind
him
with
a
courage
that
did
him
honor
of
all
the
people
at
kenmuir
two
only
ever
dreamed
the
whole
depth
of
his
unhappiness
and
that
not
through
david
james
moore
suspected
something
of
it
all
for
he
knew
more
of
than
did
the
others
while
owd
bob
knew
it
as
did
no
one
else
he
could
tell
it
from
the
touch
of
the
boy
hand
on
his
head
and
the
story
was
writ
large
upon
his
face
for
a
dog
to
read
and
he
would
follow
the
lad
about
with
a
compassion
in
his
sad
gray
eyes
greater
than
words
david
might
well
compare
his
gray
friend
at
kenmuir
with
that
other
at
the
grange
the
tailless
tyke
had
now
grown
into
an
immense
dog
heavy
of
muscle
and
huge
of
bone
a
great
bull
head
undershot
jaw
square
and
lengthy
and
terrible
vicious
eyes
cropped
ears
and
an
expression
incomparably
savage
his
coat
was
a
tawny
yellow
short
harsh
dense
and
his
back
running
up
from
shoulder
to
loins
ended
abruptly
in
the
tail
he
looked
like
the
devil
of
a
hell
and
his
reputation
was
as
bad
as
his
looks
he
never
attacked
unprovoked
but
a
challenge
was
never
ignored
and
he
was
greedy
of
insults
already
he
had
nigh
killed
rob
saunderson
collie
shep
jem
burton
monkey
fled
incontinently
at
the
sound
of
his
approach
while
he
had
even
fought
a
round
with
that
redoubtable
trio
the
vexer
venus
and
van
tromp
nor
in
the
matter
of
war
did
he
confine
himself
to
his
own
kind
his
huge
strength
and
indomitable
courage
made
him
the
match
of
almost
anything
that
moved
long
kirby
once
threatened
him
with
a
broomstick
the
smith
never
did
it
again
while
in
the
border
ram
he
attacked
big
bell
the
squire
underkeeper
with
such
murderous
fury
that
it
took
all
the
men
in
the
room
to
pull
him
off
more
than
once
had
he
and
owd
bob
essayed
to
wipe
out
mutual
memories
red
wull
in
this
case
only
the
aggressor
as
yet
however
while
they
fenced
a
moment
for
that
deadly
the
value
of
which
each
knew
so
well
james
moore
had
always
seized
the
chance
to
intervene
that
right
hide
him
ahint
yer
petticoats
sneered
on
one
of
these
occasions
hide
it
not
be
him
i
hide
i
warn
you
the
master
answered
grimly
as
he
stood
twirling
his
good
oak
stick
between
the
duellists
whereat
there
was
a
loud
laugh
at
the
little
expense
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
to
be
other
points
of
rivalry
between
the
two
than
memories
for
in
the
matter
of
his
own
business
the
handling
of
sheep
red
wull
bid
fair
to
be
second
only
throughout
the
daleland
to
the
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
and
was
patient
and
painstaking
in
the
training
of
his
wullie
in
a
manner
to
astonish
david
it
would
have
been
touching
had
it
not
been
so
unnatural
in
view
of
his
treatment
of
his
own
blood
to
watch
the
tender
carefulness
with
which
the
little
man
moulded
the
dog
beneath
his
hands
after
a
promising
display
he
would
stand
rubbing
his
palms
together
as
near
content
as
ever
he
was
weel
done
wullie
weel
done
bide
a
wee
and
we
show
a
thing
or
two
you
and
i
wullie
warld
wrack
we
share
the
warstle
and
the
care
for
it
you
and
i
alane
and
the
dog
would
trot
up
to
him
place
his
great
forepaws
on
his
shoulders
and
stand
thus
with
his
great
head
overtopping
his
master
his
ears
back
and
stump
tail
vibrating
you
saw
them
at
their
best
when
thus
together
displaying
each
his
one
soft
side
to
the
other
from
the
very
first
david
and
red
wull
were
open
enemies
under
the
circumstances
indeed
nothing
else
was
possible
sometimes
the
great
dog
would
follow
on
the
lad
heels
with
surly
greedy
eyes
never
leaving
him
from
sunrise
to
sundown
till
david
could
hardly
hold
his
hands
so
matters
went
on
for
a
year
then
there
came
a
climax
one
evening
on
a
day
throughout
which
red
wull
had
dogged
him
thus
hungrily
david
his
work
finished
went
to
pick
up
his
coat
which
he
had
left
hard
by
on
it
lay
red
wull
git
off
ma
coat
the
boy
ordered
angrily
marching
up
but
the
great
dog
never
stirred
he
lifted
a
lip
to
show
a
fence
of
white
even
teeth
and
seemed
to
sink
lower
in
the
ground
his
head
on
his
paws
his
eyes
in
his
forehead
come
and
take
it
he
seemed
to
say
now
what
between
master
and
dog
david
had
endured
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
that
day
yo
wo
wo
yo
girt
brute
he
shouted
and
bending
snatched
a
corner
of
the
coat
and
attempted
to
jerk
it
away
at
that
red
wull
rose
shivering
to
his
feet
and
with
a
low
gurgle
sprang
at
the
boy
david
quick
as
a
flash
dodged
bent
and
picked
up
an
ugly
stake
lying
at
his
feet
swinging
round
all
in
a
moment
he
dealt
his
antagonist
a
mighty
buffet
on
the
side
of
the
head
dazed
with
the
blow
the
great
dog
fell
then
recovering
himself
with
a
terrible
deep
roar
he
sprang
again
then
it
must
have
gone
hard
with
the
boy
muscular
young
giant
though
he
was
for
red
wull
was
now
in
the
first
bloom
of
that
great
strength
which
earned
him
afterward
an
undying
notoriety
in
the
land
as
it
chanced
however
had
watched
the
scene
from
the
kitchen
and
now
he
came
hurrying
out
of
the
house
shrieking
commands
and
curses
at
the
combatants
as
red
wull
sprang
he
interposed
between
the
two
head
back
and
eyes
flashing
his
small
person
received
the
full
shock
of
the
charge
he
staggered
but
recovered
and
in
an
imperative
voice
ordered
the
dog
to
heel
then
he
turned
on
david
seized
the
stake
from
his
hand
and
began
furiously
belaboring
the
boy
i
teach
ye
to
strike
a
puir
dumb
harmless
creetur
ye
cruel
cruel
he
cried
hoo
daur
ye
strike
ma
wullie
yer

wullie
adam
m
red
wull
he
was
panting
from
his
exertions
and
his
eyes
were
blazing
i
pit
up
as
best
i
can
all

o
disrespect
to

but
when
it
comes
to
takin
ma
puir
wullie
i
canna
thole
it
ha
ye
no

he
asked
unconscious
of
the
irony
of
the
question
as
much
as
some
i
david
muttered
eh
what
that
what
d
say
ye
may
thrash
me
till
ye
blind
and
it
yer
duty
but
if
only
one
daurs
so
much
as
to
look
at
yer
wullie
ye
mad
the
boy
answered
bitterly
and
with
that
he
turned
away
defiantly
and
openly
in
the
direction
of
kenmuir
made
a
step
forward
and
then
stopped
i
see
ye
agin
ma
lad
this
evenin
he
cried
with
cruel
significance
i
doot
but
yo
be
too
drunk
to
see
owt
except
your
bottle
the
boy
shouted
back
and
swaggered
down
the
hill
at
kenmuir
that
night
the
marked
and
particular
kindness
of
elizabeth
moore
was
too
much
for
the
overstrung
lad
overcome
by
the
contrast
of
her
sweet
motherliness
he
burst
into
a
storm
of
invective
against
his
father
his
home
his
life
everything
do
davie
do
dearie
cried
moore
much
distressed
and
taking
him
to
her
she
talked
to
the
great
sobbing
boy
as
though
he
were
a
child
at
length
he
lifted
his
face
and
looked
up
and
seeing
the
white
wan
countenance
of
his
dear
comforter
was
struck
with
tender
remorse
that
he
had
given
way
and
pained
her
who
looked
so
frail
and
thin
herself
he
mastered
himself
with
an
effort
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
his
usual
cheery
self
he
teased
maggie
into
tears
chaffed
stolid
little
andrew
and
bantered
todd
until
that
generally
impassive
man
threatened
to
bash
his
snout
for
him
yet
it
was
with
a
great
swallowing
at
his
throat
that
later
he
turned
down
the
slope
for
home
james
moore
and
parson
leggy
accompanied
him
to
the
bridge
over
the
wastrel
and
stood
a
while
watching
as
he
disappeared
into
the
summer
night
yon
a
good
lad
said
the
master
half
to
himself
yes
the
parson
replied
i
always
thought
there
was
good
in
the
boy
if
only
his
father
give
him
a
chance
and
look
at
the
way
owd
bob
there
follows
him
there
not
another
soul
outside
kenmuir
he
do
that
ay
sir
said
the
master
bob
knows
a
mon
when
he
sees
he
does
acquiesced
the
other
and
by
the
by
james
the
talk
in
the
village
is
that
you
settled
not
to
run
him
for
the
cup
is
that
so
the
master
nodded
it
is
sir
they
all
mad
i
should
but
i
mun
cross
they
say
he
reached
his
prime
and
so
he
has
o
his
body
but
not
o
his
brain
and
a
unlike
other
dogs
is
not
at
his
best
till
his
brain
is
at
its
best
and
that
takes
a
while
developin
same
as
in
a
mon
i
well
well
said
the
parson
pulling
out
a
favorite
phrase
winning
waiting
david
slipped
up
into
his
room
and
into
bed
unseen
he
hoped
alone
with
the
darkness
he
allowed
himself
the
rare
relief
of
tears
and
at
length
fell
asleep
he
awoke
to
find
his
father
standing
at
his
bedside
the
little
man
held
a
feeble
in
his
hand
which
lit
his
sallow
face
in
crude
black
and
white
in
the
doorway
dimly
outlined
was
the
great
figure
of
red
wull
whaur
ha
ye
been
the
day
the
little
man
asked
then
looking
down
on
the
white
stained
face
beneath
him
he
added
hurriedly
if
ye
like
to
lie
i
believe
david
was
out
of
bed
and
standing
up
in
his
he
looked
at
his
father
contemptuously
i
ha
bin
at
kenmuir
i
not
lie
for
yo
or
your
likes
he
said
proudly
the
little
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
lee
and
stick
to
it
is
my
rule
and
a
good
one
too
in
honest
england
i
for
one
no
think
ony
the
worse
o
ye
if
yer
memory
plays
yer
think
i
care
a
kick
what
yo
think
o
me
the
boy
asked
brutally
nay
there
liars
in
this
the
candle
trembled
and
was
still
again
a
lickin
or
a
lie
tak
yer
choice
the
boy
looked
scornfully
down
on
his
father
standing
on
his
naked
feet
he
already
towered
half
a
head
above
the
other
and
was
twice
the
man
think
i
fear
o
a
thrashin
fra
yo
goo
gracious
me
he
sneered
why
i
as
lief
let
owd
grammer
maddox
lick
me
for
all
i
a
reference
to
his
physical
insufficiencies
fired
the
little
man
as
surely
as
a
lighted
match
powder
ye
maun
be
cauld
standin
there
so
rin
ye
doon
and
fetch
oor
little
frien
a
reference
to
a
certain
strap
hanging
in
the
kitchen
see
if
i
can
warm
david
turned
and
stumbled
down
the
unlit
narrow
stairs
the
hard
cold
boards
struck
like
death
against
his
naked
feet
at
his
heels
followed
red
wull
his
hot
breath
fanning
the
boy
bare
legs
so
into
the
kitchen
and
back
up
the
stairs
and
red
wull
always
following
i
no
despair
yet
o
teachin
ye
the
fifth
commandment
though
i
kill
masel
in
doin
it
cried
the
little
man
seizing
the
strap
from
the
boy
numb
grasp
when
it
was
over
turned
breathless
away
at
the
threshold
of
the
room
he
stopped
and
looked
round
a
little
devilish
figure
framed
in
the
door
while
from
the
blackness
behind
red
eyes
gleamed
yellow
glancing
back
the
little
man
caught
such
an
expression
on
face
that
for
once
he
was
fairly
afraid
he
banged
the
door
and
hobbled
actively
down
the
stairs
chapter
vii
the
white
winter
in
his
sober
moments
at
least
never
touched
david
again
instead
he
devoted
himself
to
the
more
congenial
exercise
of
the
whiplash
of
his
tongue
and
he
was
wise
for
david
who
was
already
nigh
a
head
the
taller
of
the
two
and
comely
and
strong
in
proportion
could
if
he
would
have
taken
his
father
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
crumpled
him
like
a
dry
leaf
moreover
with
his
tongue
at
least
the
little
man
enjoyed
the
noble
pleasure
of
making
the
boy
wince
and
so
the
war
was
carried
on
none
the
less
vindictively
meanwhile
another
summer
was
passing
away
and
every
day
brought
fresh
proofs
of
the
prowess
of
owd
bob
tammas
whose
stock
of
yarns
anent
rex
son
of
rally
had
after
forty
years
hard
wear
begun
to
pall
on
the
loyal
ears
of
even
old
jonas
found
no
lack
of
new
material
now
in
the
dalesman
daughter
in
silverdale
and
in
the
border
ram
at
each
succeeding
market
day
brought
some
fresh
tale
men
told
how
the
gray
dog
had
outdone
gypsy
jack
the
how
he
had
cut
out
a
kenmuir
shearling
from
the
very
centre
of
pack
and
a
thousand
like
stories
the
gray
dogs
of
kenmuir
have
always
been
equally
heroes
and
favorites
in
the
daleland
and
the
confidence
of
the
dalesmen
in
owd
bob
was
now
invincible
sometimes
on
market
days
he
would
execute
some
unaccountable
maneuvre
and
strange
shepherd
would
ask
what
the
gray
dog
at
to
which
the
nearest
dalesman
would
reply
nay
i
canno
tell
ye
but
he
reet
enough
yon
owd
bob
o
whereon
the
stranger
would
prick
his
ears
and
watch
with
close
attention
yon
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
is
he
he
would
say
for
already
among
the
faculty
the
name
was
becoming
known
and
never
in
such
a
case
did
the
young
dog
fail
to
justify
the
faith
of
his
supporters
it
came
therefore
as
a
keen
disappointment
to
every
dalesman
from
herbert
trotter
secretary
of
the
trials
to
little
billy
thornton
when
the
master
persisted
in
his
decision
not
to
run
the
dog
for
the
cup
in
the
approaching
dale
trials
and
that
though
parson
squire
and
even
lady
eleanour
essayed
to
shake
his
purpose
it
was
nigh
fifty
years
since
rex
son
o
rally
had
won
back
the
trophy
for
the
land
that
gave
it
birth
it
was
time
they
thought
for
a
daleland
dog
a
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
the
terms
are
practically
synonymous
to
bring
it
home
again
and
tammas
that
polished
was
only
expressing
the
feelings
of
every
dalesman
in
the
room
when
one
night
at
the
arms
he
declared
of
owd
bob
that
to
ha
run
was
to
ha
at
which
sniggered
audibly
and
winked
at
red
wull
to
ha
run
was
to
ha
one
lickin
to
rin
next
year
be
to
win
next
tammas
interposed
dogmatically
onless
with
shivering
sarcasm
you
and
yer
wullie
are
thinkin
o
the
little
man
rose
from
his
solitary
seat
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
pattered
across
wullie
and
i
are
thinkin
o

he
whispered
loudly
in
the
old
man
ear
and
mair
what
adam
and
his
red
wull

o
doin
that
ye
may
remairk
thornton
they
do
next
year
we
rin
and
next
year
we
win
come
wullie
we
leave
to
chew
that
and
he
marched
out
of
the
room
amid
the
jeers
of
the
assembled
topers
when
quiet
was
restored
it
was
jim
mason
who
declared
one
thing
certain
win
or
no
they
not
be
far
meanwhile
the
summer
ended
abruptly
hard
on
the
heels
of
a
sweltering
autumn
the
winter
came
down
in
that
year
the
daleland
assumed
very
early
its
white
cloak
the
silver
mere
was
soon
the
wastrel
rolled
sullenly
down
below
kenmuir
its
creeks
and
quiet
places
tented
with
jagged
sheets
of
ice
while
the
scaur
and
muir
pike
raised
hoary
heads
against
the
frosty
blue
it
was
the
season
still
remembered
in
the
north
as
the
white
winter
the
worst
they
say
since
the
famous
for
days
together
jim
mason
was
stuck
with
his
bags
in
the
daughter
and
there
was
no
communication
between
the
two
dales
on
the
mere
marches
the
snow
massed
deep
and
impassable
in
thick
billowy
drifts
in
the
devil
bowl
men
said
it
lay
piled
some
score
feet
deep
and
sheep
seeking
shelter
in
the
ghylls
and
protected
spots
were
buried
and
lost
in
their
hundreds
that
is
the
time
to
test
the
hearts
of
shepherds
and
when
the
wind
runs
across
the
waste
of
white
and
the
low
woods
on
the
upland
walks
shiver
black
through
a
veil
of
snow
and
sheep
must
be
found
and
folded
or
lost
a
trial
of
head
as
well
as
heart
of
resource
as
well
as
resolution
in
that
winter
more
than
one
man
and
many
a
dog
lost
his
life
in
the
quiet
performance
of
his
duty
gliding
to
death
over
the
slippery
or
overwhelmed
beneath
an
avalanche
of
the
warm
suffocating
white
smoored
as
they
call
it
many
a
deed
was
done
many
a
death
died
recorded
only
in
that
book
which
holds
the
names
of
those
men
or
animals
souls
or
no
souls
who
tried
they
found
old
wrottesley
the
squire
head
shepherd
lying
one
morning
at
gill
foot
like
a
statue
in
its
white
bed
the
snow
gently
blowing
about
the
venerable
face
calm
and
beautiful
in
death
and
stretched
upon
his
bosom
her
master
hands
blue
and
stiff
still
clasped
about
her
neck
his
old
dog
jess
she
had
huddled
there
as
a
last
hope
to
keep
the
dear
dead
master
warm
her
great
heart
riven
hoping
where
there
was
no
hope
that
night
she

him
to

in
a
better

as

huskily
we
ken
better
cyril

a
young
man
not
overburdened
with
emotions
told
with
a
sob
in
his
voice
how
at
the
terrible
rowan
rock
jim
mason
had
stood
impotent
dumb
watching
betsy
betsy
the
friend
and
partner
of
the
last
ten
years
slipping
over
the
surface
silently
appealing
to
the
hand
that
had
never
failed
her
before
sliding
to
eternity
in
the
daleland
that
winter
the
endurance
of
many
a
shepherd
and
his
dog
was
strained
past
from
the
frozen
black
water
to
the
grammoch
pike
two
men
only
each
always
with
his
shaggy
adjutant
never
owned

never
turned
back
never
failed
in
a
thing
attempted
in
the
following
spring
tinkerton
the
squire
agent
declared
that
james
moore
and
adam
owd
bob
rather
and
red
wull
had
lost
between
them
fewer
sheep
than
any
single
farmer
on
the
whole
march
mere
estate
a
proud
record
of
the
two
many
a
tale
was
told
that
winter
they
were
invincible
incomparable
worthy
antagonists
it
was
owd
bob
who
when
he
could
not
drive
the
band
of
black
faces
over
the
narrow
razorback
which
led
to
safety
induced
them
to
him
across
that
one
by
one
like
children
behind
their
mistress
it
was
red
wull
who
was
seen
coming
down
the
precipitous
saddler
how
shouldering
up
that
grand
old
gentleman
king
o
the
dale
whose
leg
was
broken
the
gray
dog
it
was
who
found
cyril
gilbraith
by
the
white
stones
with
a
cigarette
and
a
sprained
ankle
on
the
night
the
whole
village
was
out
with
lanterns
searching
for
the
young
scapegrace
it
was
the
tailless
tyke
and
his
master
who
one
bitter
evening
came
upon
little
burton
lying
in
a
huddle
beneath
the
lea
of
the
druid
pillar
with
her
latest
baby
on
her
breast
it
was
little
who
took
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
the
child
in
it
little
who
unwound
his
plaid
threw
it
like
a
breastband
across
the
dog
great
chest
and
tied
the
ends
round
the
weary
woman
waist
red
wull
it
was
who
dragged
her
back
to
the
sylvester
arms
and
life
straining
like
a
giant
through
the
snow
while
his
master
staggered
behind
with
the
babe
in
his
arms
when
they
reached
the
inn
it
was
who
with
a
smile
on
his
face
told
the
landlord
what
he
thought
of
him
for
sending
wife
across
the
marches
on
such
a
day
and
on
his
errand
to
which
a
cauld
pleaded
honest
jem
for
days
together
david
could
not
cross
the
stony
bottom
to
kenmuir
his
enforced
confinement
to
the
grange
led
however
to
no
more
frequent
collisions
than
usual
with
his
father
for
and
red
wull
were
out
at
all
hours
in
all
weathers
night
and
day
toiling
at
their
work
of
salvation
at
last
one
afternoon
david
managed
to
cross
the
bottom
at
a
point
where
a
fallen
gave
him
a
bridge
over
the
soft
snow
he
stayed
but
a
little
while
at
kenmuir
yet
when
he
started
for
home
it
was
snowing
again
by
the
time
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
wastrel
a
blizzard
was
raging
the
wind
roared
past
him
smiting
him
so
that
he
could
barely
stand
and
the
snow
leaped
at
him
so
that
he
could
not
see
but
he
held
on
doggedly
slipping
sliding
tripping
down
and
up
again
with
one
arm
shielding
his
face
on
on
into
the
white
darkness
blindly
on
sobbing
stumbling
dazed
at
length
nigh
dead
he
reached
the
brink
of
the
stony
bottom
he
looked
up
and
he
looked
down
but
nowhere
in
that
blinding
mist
could
he
see
the
fallen
he
took
a
step
forward
into
the
white
morass
and
up
to
his
thigh
he
struggled
feebly
to
free
himself
and
sank
deeper
the
snow
wreathed
twisting
round
him
like
a
white
flame
and
he
collapsed
softly
crying
on
that
soft
bed
i
canna
i
canna
he
moaned
little
moore
her
face
whiter
and
frailer
than
ever
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
storm
i
canna
rest
for
thinkin
o
th
lad
she
said
then
turning
she
saw
her
husband
his
fur
cap
down
over
his
ears
buttoning
his
about
his
throat
while
owd
bob
stood
at
his
feet
waiting
ye
no
goin
james
she
asked
anxiously
but
i
am
lass
he
answered
and
she
knew
him
too
well
to
say
more
so
those
two
went
quietly
out
to
save
life
or
lose
it
nor
counted
the
cost
down
a
slope
over
a
spar
of
ice
up
an
eternal
hill
a
forlorn
hope
in
a
whirlwind
chaos
of
snow
the
tempest
storming
at
them
the
white
earth
lashing
them
they
fought
a
good
fight
in
front
owd
bob
the
snow
clogging
his
shaggy
coat
his
hair
cutting
like
lashes
of
steel
across
eyes
his
head
lowered
as
he
followed
the
finger
of
god
and
close
behind
james
moore
his
back
stern
against
the
storm
stalwart
still
yet
swaying
like
a
tree
before
the
wind
so
they
battled
through
to
the
brink
of
the
stony
bottom
only
to
arrive
too
late
for
just
as
the
master
peering
about
him
had
caught
sight
of
a
shapeless
lump
lying
motionless
in
front
there
loomed
across
the
gulf
through
the
white
riot
of
the
storm
a
gigantic
figure
forging
doggedly
forward
his
great
head
down
to
meet
the
hurricane
and
close
behind
buffeted
and
bruised
stiff
and
staggering
a
little
dauntless
figure
holding
stubbornly
on
clutching
with
one
hand
at
the
gale
and
a
shrill
voice
whirled
away
on
the
trumpet
tones
of
the
wind
crying
wullie
wi
me
scots
wha
hae
wi

here
he
is
wullie
or
to
victorie
the
brave
little
voice
died
away
the
quest
was
over
the
lost
sheep
found
and
the
last
james
moore
saw
of
them
was
the
same
small
gallant
form
half
carrying
half
dragging
the
rescued
boy
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
away
david
was
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
for
on
reaching
home
produced
a
familiar
bottle
here
something
to
warm
yer
inside
and
making
a
feint
at
the
strap
on
the
walls
here
something
to
do
the
same
by
yer
but
wullie
oot
again
and
out
they
went
unreckoned
heroes
it
was
but
a
week
later
in
the
very
heart
of
the
bitter
time
that
there
came
a
day
when
from
gray
dawn
to
grayer
eve
neither
james
moore
nor
owd
bob
stirred
out
into
the
wintry
white
and
the
master
face
was
hard
and
set
as
it
always
was
in
time
of
trouble
outside
the
wind
screamed
down
the
dale
while
the
snow
fell
relentlessly
softly
fingering
the
windows
blocking
the
doors
and
piling
deep
against
the
walls
inside
the
house
there
was
a
strange
quiet
no
sound
save
for
hushed
voices
and
upstairs
the
shuffling
of
muffled
feet
below
all
day
long
owd
bob
patrolled
the
passage
like
some
silent
gray
spectre
once
there
came
a
low
knocking
at
the
door
and
david
his
face
and
hair
and
cap
smothered
in
the
white
came
in
with
an
eddy
of
snow
he
patted
owd
bob
and
moved
on
tiptoe
into
the
kitchen
to
him
came
maggie
softly
shoes
in
hand
with
white
frightened
face
the
two
whispered
anxiously
awhile
like
brother
and
sister
as
they
were
then
the
boy
crept
quietly
away
only
a
little
pool
of
water
on
the
floor
and
wet
treacherous
toward
the
door
testifying
to
the
visitor
toward
evening
the
wind
died
down
but
the
mourning
flakes
still
fell
with
the
darkening
of
night
owd
bob
retreated
to
the
porch
and
lay
down
on
his
blanket
the
light
from
the
lamp
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
shone
through
the
crack
of
open
door
on
his
dark
head
and
the
eyes
that
never
slept
the
hours
passed
and
the
gray
knight
still
kept
his
vigil
alone
in
the
darkness
alone
it
almost
seemed
in
the
house
he
watched
his
head
lay
motionless
along
his
paws
but
the
steady
gray
eyes
never
flinched
or
drooped
time
tramped
on
on
leaden
foot
and
still
he
waited
and
ever
the
pain
of
hovering
anxiety
was
stamped
deeper
in
the
gray
eyes
at
length
it
grew
past
bearing
the
hollow
stillness
of
the
house
overcame
him
he
rose
pushed
open
the
door
and
softly
pattered
across
the
passage
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
halted
his
forepaws
on
the
first
step
his
grave
face
and
pleading
eyes
uplifted
as
though
he
were
praying
the
dim
light
fell
on
the
raised
head
and
the
white
escutcheon
on
his
breast
shone
out
like
the
snow
on
salmon
at
length
with
a
sound
like
a
sob
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
stood
listening
his
tail
dropping
and
head
raised
then
he
turned
and
began
softly
pacing
up
and
down
like
some
sentinel
at
the
gate
of
death
up
and
down
up
and
down
softly
as
the
falling
snow
for
a
weary
weary
while
again
he
stopped
and
stood
listening
intently
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
his
gray
coat
quivered
as
though
there
were
a
draught
of
a
sudden
the
deathly
stillness
of
the
house
was
broken
upstairs
feet
were
running
hurriedly
there
was
a
cry
and
again
silence
a
life
was
coming
in
a
life
was
going
out
the
minutes
passed
hours
passed
and
at
the
sunless
dawn
a
life
passed
and
all
through
that
night
of
agony
the
gray
figure
stood
still
as
a
statue
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
only
when
with
the
first
chill
breath
of
the
morning
a
dry
sob
of
a
strong
man
sorrowing
for
the
helpmeet
of
a
score
of
years
and
a
tiny
cry
of
a
child
wailing
because
its
mother
was
not
came
down
to
his
ears
the
gray
watchman
dropped
his
head
upon
his
bosom
and
with
a
little
whimpering
note
crept
back
to
his
blanket
a
little
later
the
door
above
opened
and
james
moore
tramped
down
the
stairs
he
looked
taller
and
gaunter
than
his
wont
but
there
was
no
trace
of
emotion
on
his
face
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
owd
bob
stole
out
to
meet
him
he
came
crouching
up
head
and
tail
down
in
a
manner
no
man
ever
saw
before
or
since
at
his
master
feet
he
stopped
then
for
one
short
moment
james
moore
whole
face
quivered
well
lad
he
said
quite
low
and
his
voice
broke
she
awa
that
was
all
for
they
were
an
undemonstrative
couple
then
they
turned
and
went
out
together
into
the
bleak
morning
chapter
viii
and
his
coat
to
david
the
loss
of
gentle
elizabeth
moore
was
as
real
a
grief
as
to
her
children
yet
he
manfully
smothered
his
own
aching
heart
and
devoted
himself
to
comforting
the
mourners
at
kenmuir
in
the
days
succeeding
moore
death
the
boy
recklessly
neglected
his
duties
at
the
grange
but
little
forbore
to
rebuke
him
at
times
indeed
he
essayed
to
be
passively
kind
david
however
was
too
deeply
sunk
in
his
great
sorrow
to
note
the
change
the
day
of
the
funeral
came
the
earth
was
throwing
off
its
and
the
dale
was
lost
in
a
mourning
mist
in
the
afternoon
was
standing
at
the
window
of
the
kitchen
contemplating
the
infinite
weariness
of
the
scene
when
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
shut
noiselessly
red
wull
raised
himself
on
to
the
sill
and
growled
and
david
hurried
past
the
window
making
for
kenmuir
watched
the
passing
figure
indifferently
then
with
an
angry
oath
sprang
to
the
window
bring
me
back
that
coat
ye
thief
he
cried
tapping
fiercely
on
the
pane
tak

and
tear

and
it

to

he
threw
the
window
up
with
a
bang
and
leaned
out
bring

i
tell

ondootiful

i
summons

or
i

david
paid
no
heed
except
to
begin
running
heavily
down
the
hill
the
coat
was
stretched
in
wrinkled
agony
across
his
back
his
big
red
wrists
protruded
like
from
the
sleeves
and
the
little
tails
flapped
wearily
in
vain
attempts
to
reach
the
wearer
legs
bubbling
over
with
indignation
scrambled
half
through
the
open
window
then
tickled
at
the
amazing
impudence
of
the
thing
he
paused
smiled
dropped
to
the
ground
again
and
watched
the
uncouth
retreating
figure
with
chuckling
amusement
did
ye
ever
see
the
like
o
that
wullie
he
muttered
ma
puir

puir
wee

her

a

there

and
stretchin
her

to
brakin
for
a
the
world
as
he
does
ma
forbearance
and
what
he
care
aboot
the
one
or
not
a
as
he
stood
watching
the
disappearing
figure
there
began
the
slow
tolling
of
the
in
the
little
dale
church
now
near
now
far
now
loud
now
low
its
dull
chant
rang
out
through
the
mist
like
the
tears
of
a
mourning
world
listened
almost
reverently
as
the
bell
tolled
on
the
only
sound
in
the
quiet
dale
outside
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
the
snow
dribbled
down
the
hill
in
muddy
tricklets
and
trees
and
roofs
and
windows
dripped
and
still
the
bell
tolled
on
calling
up
relentlessly
sad
memories
of
the
long
ago
it
was
on
just
such
another
dreary
day
in
just
such
another
december
and
not
so
many
years
gone
by
that
the
light
had
gone
forever
out
of
his
life
the
whole
picture
rose
as
instant
to
his
eyes
as
if
it
had
been
but
yesterday
that
insistent
bell
brought
the
scene
surging
back
to
him
the
dismal
day
the
drizzle
the
few
mourners
little
david
decked
out
in
black
his
fair
hair
contrasting
with
his
gloomy
clothes
his
face
swollen
with
weeping
the
dale
hushed
it
seemed
in
death
save
for
the
tolling
of
the
bell
and
his
love
had
left
him
and
gone
to
the
happy
land
the
talk
of
red
wull
who
had
been
watching
him
uneasily
now
came
up
and
shoved
his
muzzle
into
his
master
hand
the
cold
touch
brought
the
little
man
back
to
earth
he
shook
himself
turned
wearily
away
from
the
window
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
house
he
stood
there
looking
out
and
all
round
him
was
the
eternal
drip
drip
of
the
thaw
the
wind
lulled
and
again
the
tolled
out
clear
and
inexorable
resolute
to
recall
what
was
and
what
had
been
with
a
choking
gasp
the
little
man
turned
into
the
house
and
ran
up
the
stairs
and
into
his
room
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
great
chest
in
the
corner
and
unlocked
the
bottom
drawer
the
key
turning
noisily
in
its
socket
in
the
drawer
he
searched
with
feverish
fingers
and
produced
at
length
a
little
paper
packet
wrapped
about
with
a
stained
yellow
ribbon
it
was
the
ribbon
she
had
used
to
weave
on
sundays
into
her
soft
hair
inside
the
packet
was
a
cheap
frame
and
in
it
a
photograph
up
there
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
little
man
ran
down
the
stairs
red
wull
jostling
him
as
he
went
and
hurried
to
the
window
in
the
kitchen
it
was
a
sweet
laughing
face
that
looked
up
at
him
from
the
frame
demure
yet
arch
shy
yet
roguish
a
face
to
look
at
and
a
face
to
love
as
he
looked
a
wintry
smile
wholly
tender
half
tearful
stole
over
the
little
man
face
lassie
he
whispered
and
his
voice
was
infinitely
soft
it
lang
sin
i
daured
look
at
ye
but
it
no
that
ye
forgotten
then
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
though
he
were
blinded
dinna
look
at
me
sae
lass
he
cried
and
fell
on
his
knees
kissing
the
picture
hugging
it
to
him
and
sobbing
passionately
red
wull
came
up
and
pushed
his
face
compassionately
into
his
master
but
the
little
man
shoved
him
roughly
away
and
the
dog
retreated
into
a
corner
abashed
and
reproachful
memories
swarmed
back
on
the
little
man
it
was
more
than
a
decade
ago
now
and
yet
he
dared
barely
think
of
that
last
evening
when
she
had
lain
so
white
and
still
in
the
little
room
above
pit
the
bairn
on
the
bed
adam
man
she
had
said
in
low
tones
be
gaein
in
a
wee
while
noo
it
the
lang
to
you
and
he
had
done
her
bidding
and
lifted
david
up
the
tiny
boy
lay
still
a
moment
looking
at
this
mother
whom
he
hardly
recognized
minnie
he
called
piteously
then
thrusting
a
small
dirty
hand
into
his
pocket
he
pulled
out
a
grubby
sweet
minnie
ha
a
sweetie
ain
o
davie
sweeties
and
he
held
it
out
anxiously
in
his
warm
plump
palm
thinking
it
a
certain
cure
for
any
eat
it
for
mither
she
said
smiling
tenderly
and
then
davie
ma
heart
i
leavin
the
boy
ceased
sucking
the
sweet
and
looked
at
her
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooping
pitifully
ye
no
gaein
awa
mither
he
asked
his
face
all
working
no
leave

she
tried
to
smile
but
her
mother
heart
was
near
to
bursting
ye
tak

wee
davie
wi
ye
mither
the
child
pleaded
crawling
up
toward
her
face
the
great
tears
rolled
unrestrained
down
her
wan
cheeks
and
at
the
head
of
the
bed
was
sobbing
openly
eh

bairn

bairn
i
sair
to
leave

she
cried
brokenly
lift
him
for
me
he
placed
the
child
in
her
arms
but
she
was
too
weak
to
hold
him
so
he
laid
him
upon
his
mother
pillows
and
the
boy
wreathed
his
soft
arms
about
her
neck
and
sobbed
tempestuously
and
the
two
lay
thus
together
just
before
she
died
flora
turned
her
head
and
whispered
adam
ma
man
ye
ha
to
be
mither
and
father
baith
to
the
lad

and
she
looked
at
him
with
tender
confidence
in
her
dying
eyes
i
wull
afore
god
as
i
stan
here
i
wull
he
declared
passionately
then
she
died
and
there
was
a
look
of
ineffable
peace
upon
her
face
mither
and
father
baith
the
little
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
flung
the
photograph
from
him
red
wull
pounced
upon
it
but
leapt
at
him
as
he
mouthed
it
git

he
screamed
and
picking
it
up
stroked
it
lovingly
with
trembling
fingers
maither
and
father
baith
how
had
he
fulfilled
his
love
last
wish
how
oh
god
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
hugging
the
picture
sobbing
and
praying
red
wull
cowered
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
then
crept
whining
up
to
where
his
master
knelt
but
heeded
him
not
and
the
great
dog
slunk
away
again
there
the
little
man
knelt
in
the
gloom
of
the
winter
afternoon
a
miserable
penitent
his
head
was
bowed
upon
his
arms
his
hands
clutched
the
picture
and
he
prayed
aloud
in
gasping
halting
tones
gie

was
a
dreary
little
procession
that
wound
in
the
drizzle
from
kenmuir
to
the
little
dale
church
at
the
head
stalked
james
moore
and
close
behind
david
in
his
meagre
coat
while
last
of
all
as
if
to
guide
the
stragglers
in
the
weary
road
come
owd
bob
there
was
a
full
congregation
in
the
tiny
church
now
in
the
pew
were
cyril
gilbraith
muriel
sylvester
and
most
conspicuous
lady
eleanour
her
slender
figure
was
simply
draped
in
gray
with
gray
fur
about
the
neck
and
gray
fur
edging
sleeves
and
jacket
her
veil
was
lifted
and
you
could
see
the
soft
hair
about
her
temples
like
waves
breaking
on
white
cliffs
and
her
eyes
big
with
tender
sympathy
as
she
glanced
toward
the
pew
upon
her
right
for
there
were
the
mourners
from
kenmuir
the
master
tall
grim
and
gaunt
and
beside
him
maggie
striving
to
be
calm
and
little
andrew
the
miniature
of
his
father
alone
in
the
pew
behind
david
in
his
father
coat
the
back
of
the
church
was
packed
with
farmers
from
the
whole
march
mere
estate
friends
from
silverdale
and
and
nearly
every
soul
in
come
to
show
their
sympathy
for
the
living
and
reverence
for
the
dead
at
last
the
end
came
in
the
wet
dreariness
of
the
little
churchyard
and
slowly
the
mourners
departed
until
at
length
were
left
only
the
parson
the
master
and
owd
bob
the
parson
was
speaking
in
rough
short
accents
digging
nervously
at
the
wet
ground
the
other
tall
and
gaunt
his
face
drawn
and
stood
listening
by
his
side
was
owd
bob
scanning
his
master
countenance
a
wistful
compassion
deep
in
the
sad
gray
eyes
while
close
by
one
of
the
parson
terriers
was
nosing
inquisitively
in
the
wet
grass
of
a
sudden
james
moore
his
face
still
turned
away
stretched
out
a
hand
the
parson
broke
off
abruptly
and
grasped
it
then
the
two
men
strode
away
in
opposite
directions
the
terrier
hopping
on
three
legs
and
shaking
the
rain
off
his
hard
coat
david
steps
sounded
outside
rose
from
his
knees
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
the
boy
feet
shuffled
in
the
passage
david
the
little
man
called
in
a
tremulous
voice
he
stood
in
the
one
hand
on
the
table
the
other
clasping
the
picture
his
eyes
were
bleared
his
thin
hair
all
tossed
and
he
was
shaking
david
he
called
again
i
somethin
i
wush
to
say
to
ye
the
boy
burst
into
the
room
his
face
was
stained
with
tears
and
rain
and
the
new
black
coat
was
wet
and
slimy
all
down
the
front
and
on
the
elbows
were
muddy
blots
for
on
his
way
home
he
had
flung
himself
down
in
the
stony
bottom
just
as
he
was
heedless
of
the
wet
earth
and
his
father
coat
and
lying
on
his
face
thinking
of
that
second
mother
lost
to
him
had
wept
his
heart
out
in
a
storm
of
passionate
grief
now
he
stood
defiantly
his
hand
upon
the
door
what
want
the
little
man
looked
from
him
to
the
picture
in
his
hand
help
me
flora
he
no
he
prayed
then
raising
his
eyes
he
began
i
like
to
say
i
bin
thinkin
i
think
i
should
tell
ye
it
no
an
easy
thing
for
a
man
to
say
he
broke
off
short
the
task
was
almost
more
than
he
could
accomplish
he
looked
appealingly
at
david
but
there
was
no
glimmer
of
understanding
in
that
white
set
countenance
o
god
it
maist
mair
than
i
can
do
the
little
man
muttered
and
the
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
again
he
began
david
after
i
saw
ye
this
afternoon
steppin
doon
the
hill
again
he
paused
his
glance
rested
unconsciously
upon
the
coat
david
mistook
the
look
mistook
the
dimness
in
his
father
eyes
mistook
the
tremor
in
his
voice
here
is
tak
yo
coat
he
cried
passionately
and
tearing
it
off
flung
it
down
at
his
father
feet
tak
it
and
curse
he
banged
out
of
the
room
and
ran
upstairs
and
locking
himself
in
threw
himself
on
to
his
bed
and
sobbed
red
wull
made
a
movement
to
fly
at
the
retreating
figure
then
turned
to
his
master
his
vibrating
with
pleasure
but
little
was
looking
at
the
wet
coat
now
lying
in
a
wet
bundle
at
his
feet
curse
ye
he
repeated
softly
curse
ye
ye
heard
him
wullie
a
bitter
smile
crept
across
his
face
he
looked
again
at
the
picture
now
lying
crushed
in
his
hand
ye
canna
say
i
didna
try
ye
canna
ask
me
to
agin
he
muttered
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
niver
agin
wullie
not
if
the
queen
were
to
ask
then
he
went
out
into
the
gloom
and
drizzle
still
smiling
the
same
bitter
smile
that
night
when
it
came
to
at
the
sylvester
arms
jem
burton
found
a
little
figure
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
at
the
little
man
head
lay
a
great
dog
yo
beast
said
the
righteous
publican
regarding
the
figure
of
his
best
customer
with
fine
scorn
then
catching
sight
of
a
photograph
in
the
little
man
hand
oh
yo
that
sort
are
yo
foxy
he
leered
gie
us
a
look
at
and
he
tried
to
disengage
the
picture
from
the
other
grasp
but
at
the
attempt
the
great
dog
rose
bared
his
teeth
and
assumed
such
a
diabolical
expression
that
the
big
landlord
retreated
hurriedly
behind
the
bar
two
on
ye
he
shouted
viciously
rattling
his
heels

his
son
after
the
scene
on
the
evening
of
the
funeral
there
could
be
no
alternative
but
war
for
all
time
the
little
man
had
attempted
to
humble
himself
and
been
rejected
and
the
bitterness
of
defeat
when
he
had
deserved
victory
rankled
like
a
poisoned
barb
in
his
bosom
yet
the
heat
of
his
indignation
was
directed
not
against
david
but
against
the
master
of
kenmuir
to
the
influence
and
agency
of
james
moore
he
attributed
his
discomfiture
and
bore
himself
accordingly
in
public
or
in
private
in
or

it
was
always
endeavor
to
betray
his
enemy
into
an
unworthy
expression
of
feeling
but
james
moore
sorely
tried
as
he
often
was
never
gave
way
he
met
the
little
man
sneers
with
a
quelling
silence
looking
down
on
his
antagonist
with
such
a
contempt
flashing
from
his
eyes
as
hurt
his
adversary
more
than
words
only
once
was
he
spurred
into
reply
it
was
in
the
of
the
dalesman
daughter
on
the
occasion
of
the
big
spring
fair
in
when
there
was
a
goodly
gathering
of
farmers
and
their
dogs
in
the

standing
at
the
fireplace
with

at

end
of
the

said
sternly
that
an

ye
irritate
the
tailless
tyke
indeed
had
advanced
from
the
fireplace
and
now
stood
huge
and
hideous
in
the
very
centre
of
the
room
there
was
distant
thunder
in
his
throat
a
threat
upon
his
face
a
challenge
in
every
wrinkle
and
the
gray
dog
stole
gladly
out
from
behind
his
master
to
take
up
the
gage
of
battle
straightway
there
was
silence
tongues
ceased
to
wag
tankards
to
clink
every
man
and
every
dog
was
quietly
gathering
about
those
two
central
figures
not
one
of
them
all
but
had
his
score
to
wipe
off
against
the
tailless
tyke
not
one
of
them
but
was
burning
to
join
in
the
battle
once
begun
and
the
two
gladiators
stood
looking
past
one
another
muzzle
to
muzzle
each
with
a
tiny
flash
of
teeth
glinting
between
his
lips
but
the
fight
was
not
to
be
for
the
twentieth
time
the
master
intervened
bob
lad
coom
in
he
called
and
bending
grasped
his
favorite
by
the
neck
laughed
softly
wullie
wullie
to
me
he
cried
the
look
o

enough
for

james
moore
asked
the
little
man
very
smoothly
yes
sweer
the
other
replied
and
strode
out
of
the
room
amid
a
roar
of
derisive
laughter
at
expense
owd
bob
had
now
attained
wellnigh
the
perfection
of
his
art
parson
leggy
declared
roundly
that
his
like
had
not
been
seen
since
the
days
of
rex
son
of
rally
among
the
dalesmen
he
was
a
heroic
favorite
his
prowess
and
gentle
ways
winning
him
friends
on
every
hand
but
the
point
that
told
most
heavily
for
him
was
that
in
all
things
he
was
the
very
antithesis
of
red
wull
barely
a
man
in
the
but
owed
that
ferocious
savage
a
grudge
not
a
man
of
them
all
who
dared
pay
it
once
long
kirby
full
of
beer
and
valor
tried
to
settle
his
account
coming
on
and
red
wull
as
he
was
driving
into
he
leant
over
and
with
his
thong
dealt
the
dog
a
terrible
slash
that
raised
an
angry
ridge
of
red
from
hip
to
shoulder
and
was
twenty
yards
down
the
road
before
the
little
man
shrill
curse
reached
his
ear
drowned
in
a
hideous
bellow
he
stood
up
and
lashed
the
colt
who
quick
on
his
legs
for
a
young
un
soon
settled
to
his
gallop
but
glancing
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
a
hounding
form
behind
catching
him
as
though
he
were
walking
his
face
turned
sickly
white
he
screamed
he
flogged
he
looked
back
right
beneath
the
was
the
red
devil
in
the
dust
while
racing
a
furlong
behind
on
the
turnpike
road
was
the
mad
figure
of
the
smith
struck
back
and
flogged
forward
it
was
of
no
avail
with
a
bound
the
murderous
brute
leapt
on
the
flying
trap
at
the
shock
of
the
great
body
the
colt
was
thrown
violently
on
his
side
kirby
was
tossed
over
the
hedge
and
red
wull
pinned
beneath
the
debris
had
time
to
rush
up
and
save
a
tragedy
i
a
mind
to
knife
ye
kirby
he
panted
as
he
bandaged
the
broken
head
after
that
you
may
be
sure
the
dalesmen
preferred
to
swallow
insults
rather
than
to
risk
their
lives
and
their
impotence
only
served
to
fan
their
hatred
to
white
heat
the
working
methods
of
the
antagonists
were
as
contrasted
as
their
appearances
in
a
word
the
one
compelled
where
the
other
coaxed
his
enemies
said
the
tailless
tyke
was
rough
not
even
tammas
denied
he
was
ready
his
brain
was
as
big
as
his
body
and
he
used
them
both
to
some
purpose
as
quick
as
a
cat
with
the
heart
of
a
lion
and
the
temper
of
nick
self
was
parson
leggy
description
what
determination
could
effect
that
could
red
wall
but
achievement
by
inaction
supremest
of
all
strategies
was
not
for
him
in
matters
of
the
subtlest
handling
where
to
act
anything
except
indifference
was
to
lose
with
sheep
restless
fearful
forebodings
hymned
to
them
by
the
wind
panic
hovering
unseen
above
them
when
an
movement
spelt
catastrophe
then
was
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
incomparable
men
still
tell
how
when
the
squire
new
ran
amuck
in
and
for
some
minutes
the
market
square
was
a
turbulent
sea
of
blaspheming
men
yelping
dogs
and
stampeding
sheep
only
one
flock
stood
calm
as
a
by
the
watching
the
riot
with
almost
indifference
and
in
front
sitting
between
them
and
the
storm
was
a
quiet
gray
dog
his
mouth
stretched
in
a
capacious
yawn
to
yawn
was
to
win
and
he
won
when
the
worst
of
the
uproar
was
over
many
a
glance
of
triumph
was
shot
first
at
that
one
still
pack
and
then
at
as
he
waded
through
the
disorder
of
huddling
sheep
and
wheer
your
wullie
noo
asked
tapper
scornfully
weel
the
little
man
answered
with
a
quiet
smile
at
this
minute
killin
your
rasper
doon
by
the
which
was
indeed
the
case
for
big
blue
rasper
had
interfered
with
the
great
dog
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
suffered
accordingly
spring
passed
into
summer
and
the
excitement
as
to
the
event
of
the
approaching
trials
when
at
length
the
rivals
would
be
pitted
against
one
another
reached
such
a
height
as
old
jonas
maddox
the
octogenarian
could
hardly
recall
down
in
the
sylvester
arms
there
was
almost
nightly
a
conflict
between
and
tammas
thornton
spokesman
of
the
dales
men
many
a
bout
of
words
had
the
two
anent
the
respective
merits
and
cup
chances
of
red
and
gray
in
these
duels
tammas
was
usually
worsted
his
temper
would
get
the
better
of
his
discretion
and
the
cynical
debater
would
be
lost
in
the
partisan
during
these
encounters
the
others
would
as
a
rule
maintain
a
rigid
silence
only
when
their
champion
was
being
beaten
and
it
was
time
for
strength
of
voice
to
vanquish
strength
of
argument
they
joined
in
right
lustily
and
roared
the
little
man
down
for
all
the
world
like
the
gentlemen
who
rule
the
empire
at
westminster
tammas
was
an
easy
subject
for
to
draw
but
david
was
an
easier
insults
directed
at
himself
the
boy
bore
with
a
stolidity
born
of
long
use
but
a
poisonous
dart
shot
against
his
friends
at
kenmuir
never
failed
to
achieve
its
object
and
the
little
man
evinced
an
amazing
talent
for
the
concoction
of
deft
lies
respecting
james
moore
i
hearin
said
he
one
evening
sitting
in
the
kitchen
sucking
his
twig
i
hearin
james
moore
is
gaein
to
git
married
yo
hearin
lies
or
tellin
david
answered
shortly
for
he
treated
his
father
now
with
contemptuous
indifference
seven
months
sin
his
wife
died
the
little
man
continued
meditatively
weel
i
he
waited
sae
lang
ain
buried
anither
come
on
that
james
david
burst
angrily
out
of
the
room
gaein
to
ask
him
if
it
true
called
his
father
after
him
gude
luck
to
ye
and
david
had
now
a
new
interest
at
kenmuir
in
maggie
he
found
an
endless
source
of
study
on
the
death
of
her
mother
the
girl
had
taken
up
the
reins
of
government
at
kenmuir
and
gallantly
she
played
her
part
whether
in
tenderly
mothering
the
baby
wee
anne
or
in
the
sterner
matters
of
household
work
she
did
her
duty
young
though
she
was
with
a
surprising
womanliness
that
won
many
a
smile
of
approval
from
her
father
and
caused
david
eyes
to
open
with
astonishment
and
he
soon
discovered
that
maggie
mistress
of
kenmuir
was
another
person
from
his
erstwhile
playfellow
and
servant
the
happy
days
when
might
ruled
right
were
gone
never
to
be
recalled
david
often
regretted
them
especially
when
in
a
conflict
of
tongues
maggie
with
her
quick
answers
and
teasing
eyes
was
driving
him
sulky
and
vanquished
from
the
field
the
two
were
perpetually
squabbling
now
in
the
good
old
days
he
remembered
bitterly
squabbles
between
them
were
unknown
he
had
never
permitted
them
any
attempt
at
independent
thought
or
action
was
as
sternly
quelled
as
in
the
middle
ages
she
must
follow
where
he
led
on
ma
word
now
she
was
mistress
where
he
had
been
master
hers
was
to
command
his
to
obey
in
consequence
they
were
perpetually
at
war
and
yet
he
would
sit
for
hours
in
the
kitchen
and
watch
her
as
she
went
about
her
business
with
solemn
interested
eyes
half
of
admiration
half
of
amusement
in
the
end
maggie
always
turned
on
him
with
a
little
laugh
touched
with
irritation
ha
yo
got
nothin
that
to
do
nor
lookin
at
me
she
asked
one
saturday
about
a
month
before
cup

answered
calmly

she
cried
tossing
her
head
ay
or

he
muttered
what
that
she
cried
springing
round
a
flush
of
color
on
her
face
nowt
my
dear
yo

soon

the
girl
resumed
her
baking
half
angry
half
suspicious
i
dunno
what
yo
mean
she
said
do
yo
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
crash
of
a
falling
plate
whereat
david
laughed
quietly
and
asked
if
he
should
help
pick
up
the
bits
on
the
same
evening
at
the
sylvester
arms
an
announcement
was
made
that
knocked
the
breath
out
of
its
hearers
in
the
debate
that
night
on
the
dale
trials
and
the
relative
abilities
of
red
and
gray
on
the

up
at
the

at

and
it

the

continued
warmly
oot
o

for

the

was
received
in
utter
silence
the
shock
of
the
surprise
coupled
with
the
bitterness
of
the
disappointment
froze
the
slow
tongues
of

only

tammas
had
but
told
the
melancholy
truth
owd
bob
was
not
to
run
for
the
cup
and
this
ordinance
speaks
more
for
james
moore
love
of
his
lost
wife
than
many
a
lordly
cenotaph
to
the
people
of
the
daleland
from
the
black
water
to
the
in
the
news
came
with
the
shock
of
a
sudden
blow
they
had
set
their
hearts
on
the
gray
dog
success
and
had
felt
serenely
confident
of
his
victory
but
the
sting
of
the
matter
lay
in
this
that
now
the
tailless
tyke
might
well
win
on
the
other
hand
was
plunged
into
a
fervor
of
delight
at
the
news
for
to
win
the
shepherds
trophy
was
the
goal
of
his
ambition
david
was
now
less
than
nothing
to
the
lonely
little
man
red
wull
everything
to
him
and
to
have
that
name
handed
down
to
posterity
gallantly
holding
its
place
among
those
of
the
most
famous
of
all
time
was
his
heart
desire
as
cup
day
drew
near
the
little
man
his
temperament
strung
to
the
highest
pitch
of
nervousness
was
tossed
on
a
sea
of
apprehension
his
hopes
and
fears
ebbed
and
flowed
on
the
tide
of
the
moment
his
moods
were
as
uncertain
as
the
winds
in
march
and
there
was
no
dependence
on
his
humor
for
a
unit
of
time
at
one
minute
he
paced
up
and
down
the
kitchen
his
face
already
flushed
with
the
glow
of
victory
chanting
scots
wha
hae
wi
wallace
bled
at
the
next
he
was
down
at
the
table
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
his
whole
figure
shaking
as
he
cried
in
choking
voice
eh
wullie
wullie
they
all
agin
david
found
that
life
with
his
father
now
was
life
with
an
unamiable
hornet
careless
as
he
affected
to
be
of
his
father
vagaries
he
was
tried
almost
to
madness
and
fled
away
at
every
moment
to
kenmuir
for
as
he
told
maggie
i
sooner
put
up
wi
your
and
miss
than
wi
him
the
wemon
that
he
be
at

the
great
day
came
fears

doubts
dismays
all
dispersed
in
the
presence
of
the
reality
cup
day
is
always
a
general
holiday
in
the
daleland
and
every
soul
crowds
over
to
silverdale
shops
were
shut
special
trains
ran
in
to
and
the
road
from
the
little
town
was
dazed
with
brakes
wagonettes
carriages
carts
wending
toward
the
dalesman
daughter
and
soon
the
paddock
below
that
little
inn
was
humming
with
the
crowd
of
sportsmen
and
spectators
come
to
see
the
battle
for
the
trophy
there
very
noticeable
with
its
red
body
and
yellow
wheels
was
the
great
kenmuir
wagon
many
an
eye
was
directed
on
the
handsome
young
pair
who
stood
in
it
conspicuous
and
unconscious
above
the
crowd
maggie
looking
in
her
simple
print
frock
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
any
mountain
flower
while
david
fair
face
was
all
gloomy
and
his
brows
knit
in
front
of
the
wagon
was
a
black
cluster
of
dalesmen
discussing
chances
in
the
centre
was

holding
forth

bessie

while

was
the
great
day
of
the
year
for
him
past

of

and
on
all
sides
was
a
mass
of
bobbing

yorkshiremen

and
left
a
long

of

its
craggy
peak
and
the
pass
trending
along
its
side
shone
white
in
the
sunshine
at
the
back
of
the
carriages
were
booths

and
all
the
panoply

together
while
melia
ross
in
the
background
was
pretending
she
did
care
on
the
far
bank
of
the
stream
was
a
little
bevy
of
men
and
dogs
observed
of
all
the
juvenile
stakes
had
been
run
and
won
londesley
lassie

carried
off

and
the
fight

whispered
maggie
to
the
silent
boy
by
her
side
nay
nor
niver
do
wush
to
david
answered
roughly
his
gaze
was
directed
over
the
array
of
heads
in
front
to
where
beyond
the
silver
lea
a
group
of
shepherds
and
their
dogs
was
clustered
while
standing
apart
from
the
rest
in
characteristic
isolation
was
the
bent
figure
of
his
father
and
beside
him
the
tailless
tyke
not
want
yo
feyther
to

asked
maggie
softly
following
his
gaze
i
prayin

the
boy
answered
moodily
eh

cried
the
girl
shocked
it
easy
to
say
david
he
snapped
but
if
yo
lived
along

he
nodded
toward
the
stream
yo

a
bit
david
indeed
i
never
did

it
lad
she
said
tenderly
and
he
was
appeased

right
hand
for
his
bless
wullie
to
win
i
give
me
right
arm
to
see
him
beat
and
oor
bob
there
all
the
while
he
nodded
to
the
far
left
of
the
line
where
stood
james
moore
and
owd
bob
with
parson
leggy
and
the
squire
when
at
length
red
wull
came
out
to
run
his
course
he
worked
with
the
savage
dash
that
always
characterized
him
his
method
was
his
own
but
the
work
was
admirably
done
keeps
right
on
the
back
of
his
sheep
said
the
parson
watching
intently
strange
thing
they
do
break
but
they
did
there
was
no
waiting
no
coaxing
it
was
drive
and
devilry
all
through
he
brought
his
sheep
along
at
a
terrific
rate
never
missing
a
turn
never
faltering
never
running
out
and
the
crowd
applauded
for
the
crowd
loves
a
dashing
display
while
little
hopping
agilely
about
his
face
ablaze
with
excitement
handled
dog
and
sheep
with
a
masterly
precision
that
compelled
the
admiration
even
of
his
enemies
wins
roared
a
bookmaker
twelve
to
one
agin
the
field
he
wins
dang
him
said
david
low
wull
wins
said
the
parson
shutting
his
lips
and
deserves
too
said
james
moore
wull
wins
softly
cried
the
crowd
we
do
said
gloomily
and
in
the
end
red
wull
did
win
and
there
were
none
save
tammas
the
bigot
and
long
kirby
who
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
his
wife
money
and
a
little
of
his
own
to
challenge
the
justice
of
the
verdict
the
win
had
but
a
chilling
reception
at
first
there
was
faint
cheering
but
it
sounded
like
the
echo
of
an
echo
and
soon
died
of
inanition
to
get
up
an
ovation
there
must
be
money
at
the
back
or
a
few
roaring
fanatics
to
lead
the
dance
here
there
was
neither
ugly
stories
disparaging
remarks
on
every
hand
and
the
hundreds
who
did
not
know
took
their
tone
as
always
from
those
who
said
they
did
could
but
remark
the
absence
of
enthusiasm
as
he
pushed
up
through
the
throng
toward
the
committee
tent
no
single
voice
hailed
him
victor
no
friendly
hand
smote
its
congratulations
broad
backs
were
turned
contemptuous
glances
levelled
spiteful
remarks
shot
only
the
foreign
element
looked
curiously
at
the
little
bent
figure
with
the
glowing
face
and
shrank
back
at
the
size
and
savage
aspect
of
the
great
dog
at
his
heels
but
what
cared
he
his
wullie
was
acknowledged
champion
the
best
of
the
year
and
the
little
man
was
happy
they
could
turn
their
backs
on
him
but
they
could
not
alter
that
and
he
could
afford
to
be
indifferent
they
dinna
like
it
lad
he
he
but
they
ha
to
thole
it
ye
won
it
wullie
won
it
he
elbowed
through
the
press
making
for
the
inclosure
in
front
of
the
committee
tent
round
which
the
people
were
now
packing
in
the
door
of
the
tent
stood
the
secretary
various
stewards
and
members
of
the
committee
in
front
alone
in
the
space
was
lady
eleanour
fragile
dainty
graceful
waiting
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
to
receive
the
winner
and
on
a
table
beside
her
naked
and
dignified
the
shepherd
trophy
there
it
stood
kingly
and
impressive
its
fair
white
sides
inscribed
with
many
names
cradled
in
three
shepherds
crooks
and
on
the
top
as
if
to
guard
the
cup
contents
an
exquisitely
carved
collie
head
the
shepherds
trophy
the
goal
of
his
life
race
and
many
another
man
he
climbed
over
the
rope
followed
by
red
wull
and
took
off
his
hat
with
almost
courtly
deference
to
the
fair
lady
before
him
as
he
walked
up
to
the
table
on
which
the
cup
stood
a
shrill
voice
easily
recognizable
broke
the
silence
you
like
it
better
if
was
full
and
yo
could
swim
in
it
you
and
yer
wullie
it
called
whereat
the
crowd
giggled
and
lady
eleanour
looked
indignant
the
little
man
turned
i
mind
drink
yer
health
thornton
never
fear
though
i
ken
prefaire
to
drink
yer
ain
he
said
at
which
the
crowd
giggled
afresh
and
a
gray
head
at
the
back
which
had
hoped
itself
unrecognized
disappeared
suddenly
the
little
man
stood
there
in
the
stillness
sourly
smiling
his
face
still
wet
from
his
exertions
while
the
tailless
tyke
at
his
side
fronted
defiantly
the
serried
ring
of
onlookers
a
white
fence
of
teeth
faintly
visible
between
his
lips
lady
eleanour
looked
uneasy
usually
the
lucky
winner
was
unable
to
hear
her
little
speech
as
she
gave
the
cup
away
so
deafening
was
the
applause
now
there
was
utter
silence
she
glanced
up
at
the
crowd
but
there
was
no
response
to
her
unspoken
appeal
in
that
forest
of
hostile
faces
and
her
gentle
heart
bled
for
the
forlorn
little
man
before
her
to
make
it
up
she
smiled
on
him
so
sweetly
as
to
more
than
compensate
him
i
sure
you
deserve
your
success
she
said
you
and
red
wull
there
worked
splendidly
everybody
says
i
heard
naethin
the
little
man
answered
dryly
at
which
some
one
in
the
crowd
sniggered
and
we
all
know
what
a
grand
dog
he
is
though
with
a
reproving
smile
as
she
glanced
at
red
wull
square
truncated
stern
he
not
very
his
heart
is
good
your
leddyship
if
his
manners
are
not
answered
smiling
liar
came
a
loud
voice
in
the
silence
lady
eleanour
looked
up
hot
with
indignation
and
half
rose
from
her
seat
but
merely
smiled
wullie
turn
and
mak
yer
bow
to
the
leddy
he
said
they
no
hurt
us
noo
we
up
it
when
we
doon
they
flock
like
corbies
to
the
at
that
red
wull
walked
up
to
lady
eleanour
faintly
wagging
his
tail
and
she
put
her
hand
on
his
huge
bull
head
and
said
dear
old
ugly
at
which
the
crowd
cheered
in
earnest
after
that
for
some
moments
the
only
sound
was
the
gentle
ripple
of
the
good
lady
voice
and
the
little
man
caustic
replies
why
last
winter
the
country
was
full
of
red
wull
doings
and
yours
it
was
always
and
his
red
wull

this
and
that
and
the
other

got
quite
tired
of
you

i
heard
such
a
lot
about
the
little
man

and
looked
genuinely
pleased
and
when
it
was
you
it
was
moore
and
owd

called
a
stentorian
voice
there
cheers
for
oor
bob
it
was
taken
up
gallantly
and
cast
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
strangers
though
they
did
not
understand
caught
the
contagion
and
cheered
too
and
the
uproar
continued
for
some
minutes
when
it
was
ended
lady
eleanour
was
standing
up
a
faint
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
flashing
dangerously
like
a
queen
at
bay
yes
she
cried
and
her
clear
voice
thrilled
through
the
air
like
a
trumpet
yes
and
now
three
cheers
for

his
red
wull
hip

little

he
said
emphatically
lady
eleanour
retreated
into
the
tent
and
the
crowd
swarmed
over
the
ropes
and
round
the
little
man
who
held
the
cup
beneath
his
arm
long
kirby
laid
irreverent
hands
upon
it
dinna
finger
it
ordered
shall
sha
wullie
keep
him
which
the
great
dog
proceeded
to
do
amid
the
laughter
of
the
onlookers
among
the
last
james
moore
was
borne
past
the
little
man
at
sight
of
him
face
assumed
an
expression
of
intense
concern
man
moore
he
cried
peering
forward
as
though
in
alarm
man
moore
ye
green
positeevely
verdant
are
ye
in
pain
then
catching
sight
of
owd
bob
he
started
back
in
affected
horror
and
ma
certes
so
yer
dog
yer
dog
as
was
gray
is
green
oh
guid
life
and
he
made
as
though
about
to
fall
fainting
to
the
ground
then
in
bantering
tones
ah
but
ye
shouldna
covet
he
ha
no
need
to
covet
it
long
i
can
tell
yo
interposed
tammas
shrill
accents
and
why
for
no
becos
next
year

fra
yo
oor
bob

it
little
mon
why
thot
the
retort
was
greeted
with
a
yell
of
applause
from
the
sprinkling
of
dalesmen
in
the
crowd
but
swaggered
away
into
the
tent
his
head
up
the
cup
beneath
his
arm
and
red
wull
guarding
his
rear
first
of
a
ye
ha
to
beat
adam
and
his
red
wull
he
cried
back
proudly
chapter
xi
oor
bob
pride
in
the
great
cup
that
now
graced
his
kitchen
was
supreme
it
stood
alone
in
the
very
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
just
below
the
old
blunderbuss
that
hung
upon
the
wall
the
only
ornament
in
the
bare
room
it
shone
out
in
its
silvery
chastity
like
the
moon
in
a
gloomy
sky
for
once
the
little
man
was
content
since
his
mother
death
david
had
never
known
such
peace
it
was
not
that
his
father
became
actively
kind
rather
that
he
forgot
to
be
actively
unkind
not
as
i
care
a
brazen
button
one
way
or
the
boy
informed
maggie
then
yo
should
that
proper
little
person
replied
was
indeed
a
changed
being
he
forgot
to
curse
james
moore
he
forgot
to
sneer
at
owd
bob
he
rarely
visited
the
sylvester
arms
to
the
detriment
of
jem
burton
pocket
and
temper
and
he
was
never
drunk
soaks
at
home
instead
suggested
tammas
the
prejudiced
but
the
accusation
was
untrue
too
drunk
to
git
so
far
said
long
kirby
kindly
man
i
the
cup
is
kind
o
company
to
him
said
jim
mason
happen
it
lonesomeness
as
drives
him
here
so
and
happen
you
were
right
charitable
jim
best
mak
maist
on
it
while
he
has
it
he
not
have
it
for
long
tammas
remarked
amid
applause
even
parson
leggy
allowed
rather
reluctantly
indeed
for
he
was
but
human
that
the
little
man
was
changed
wonderfully
for
the
better
but
i
am
afraid
it
may
not
last
he
said
we
shall
see
what
happens
when
owd
bob
beats
him
for
the
cup
as
he
certainly
will
that
be
the
critical
as
things
were
the
little
man
spent
all
his
spare
moments
with
the
cup
between
his
knees
burnishing
it
and
crooning
to
wullie
i
never
saw
a
fairer
i
never
a
dearer
and
neist
my
heart
i
wear
her
for
fear
my
jewel
there
wullie
look
at
her
is
she
no
bonnie
she
shines
like
a
twinkle
twinkle
in
the
and
he
would
hold
it
out
at
arm
length
his
head
cocked
sideways
the
better
to
scan
its
bright
beauties
the
little
man
was
very
jealous
for
his
treasure
david
might
not
touch
it
might
not
smoke
in
the
kitchen
lest
the
fumes
should
tarnish
its
glory
while
if
he
approached
too
closely
he
was
ordered
abruptly
away
as
if
i
wanted
to
touch
his
nasty
cup
he
complained
to
maggie
sooner
ony
day
hands
aff
david
immediate
she
cried
indignantly
indeed
as
she
tossed
her
head
clear
of
the
big
fingers
that
were
fondling
her
pretty
hair
so
it
was
that
on
coming
quietly
into
the
kitchen
one
day
was
consumed
with
angry
resentment
to
find
david
actually
handling
the
object
of
his
reverence
and
the
manner
of
his
doing
it
added
a
thousandfold
to
the
offence
the
boy
was
lolling
indolently
against
the
mantelpiece
his
fair
head
shoved
right
into
the
cup
his
breath
dimming
its
lustre
and
his
two
hands
big
and
dirty
slowly
revolving
it
before
his
eyes
bursting
with
indignation
the
little
man
crept
up
behind
the
boy
david
was
reading
through
the
long
list
of
winners
theer
the
first
on
he
muttered
shooting
out
his
tongue
to
indicate
the
locality
moore
rough
and
theer
agin
james
moore
pinch
and
agin
ah
and
tammas
tells
on
and
rex
ay
but
he
was
a
rare
un
by
all
if
he
won
but
onst
agin
ah
and
theer
none
like
the
gray
dogs
they
all
says
that
and
i
say
so
masel
none
like
the
gray
dogs
o
kenmuir
bless
and
we
win
agin
too
he
broke
off
short
his
eye
had
travelled
down
to
the
last
name
on
the
list
wull
he
read
with
unspeakable
contempt
and
put
his
great
thumb
across
the
name
as
though
to
wipe
it
out
wull
gracious
sakes
and
he
made
a
motion
as
though
to
spit
upon
the
ground
but
a
little
shoulder
was
into
his
side
two
small
fists
were
beating
at
his
chest
and
a
shrill
voice
was
yelling
devil
devil
awa
and
he
was
tumbled
precipitately
away
from
the
mantelpiece
and
brought
up
abruptly
against
the
the
precious
cup
swayed
on
its
ebony
stand
the
boy
hands
rudely
withdrawn
almost
overthrowing
it
but
the
little
man
first
impulse
cursing
and
screaming
though
he
was
was
to
steady
it
wull
i
wish
he
was
here
to
teach
ye
ye
profleegit
he
cried
standing
in
front
of
the
cup
his
eyes
blazing
ay
wull
and
why
not
wull
ha
ye
ony
objections
to
the
name
i
did
know
yo
was
theer
said
david
a
thought
sheepishly
na
or
ye
not
ha
said
i
ha
thought
it
though
muttered
the
boy
luckily
however
his
father
did
not
hear
he
stretched
his
hands
up
tenderly
for
the
cup
lifted
it
down
and
began
reverently
to
polish
the
dimmed
sides
with
his
handkerchief
ye
thinkin
nae
doot
he
cried
casting
up
a
vicious
glance
at
david
that
wullie
no
gude
enough
to
ha
his
name
alangside
they
cursed
gray
dogs
are
ye
no
let
ha
the
truth
for
aince
for
a
he
good
enough
if
there
none
better
david
replied
dispassionately
and
wha
should
there
be
better
tell
me
that
ye
muckle
david
smiled
eh
but
that
be
long
tellin
he
said
and
what
wad
ye
mean
by
that
his
father
cried
nay
i
was
but
thinkin
that
moore
bob
look
gradely
writ
under
he
pointed
to
the
vacant
space
below
red
wull
name
the
little
man
put
the
cup
back
on
its
pedestal
with
hurried
hands
the
handkerchief
dropped
unconsidered
to
the
floor
he
turned
and
sprang
furiously
at
the
boy
who
stood
against
the
wall
still
smiling
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
shook
him
to
and
fro
with
fiery
energy
so
ye
hopin
prayin
nae
doot
that
james
moore
curse
him
will
win
ma
cup
awa
from
me
yer
ain
dad
i

hoose
and
hame
and
what
yer
gratitude

plot
to
rob
us
of
oor
he
dropped
the
boy
coat
and
stood
back
no
rights
about
it
said
david
still
keeping
his
temper
if
i
win
is
it
no
ma
right
as
muckle
as
ony
englishman
red
wull
who
had
heard
the
rising
voices
came
trotting
in
scowled
at
david
and
took
his
stand
beside
his
master
ah
yo
win
it
said
david
with
significant
emphasis
on
the
conjunction
and
wha
to
beat
us
david
looked
at
his
father
in
surprise
i
tell
yo
owd
bob
rinin
he
answered
and
what
if
he
is
the
other
cried
why
even
yo
should
know
so
much
the
boy
sneered
the
little
man
could
not
fail
to
understand
so
that
it
he
said
then
in
a
scream
with
one
finger
pointing
to
the
great
dog
and
what
o
him
what
ma
wullie
be
doin
the
while
tell
me
that
and
ha
a
care
mind
ye
he
stan
here
hearkenin
and
indeed
the
tailless
tyke
was
bristling
for
battle
david
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
and
edged
away
toward
the
door
what
wullie
be
doin
ye
brock
his
father
cried
im
said
the
boy
now
close
on
the
door
im
he
said
with
a
slow
contempt
that
made
the
red
bristles
quiver
on
the
dog
neck
on
i
should
think
lookin
on
what
else
is
he
fit
for
i
tell
yo
oor
bob
bob
screamed
the
little
man
darting
forward
bob
hark
to
him
i
at
him
wullie
at
him
but
the
tailless
tyke
needed
no
encouragement
with
a
harsh
roar
he
sprang
through
the
air
only
to
crash
against
the
closing
door
the
outer
door
banged
and
in
another
second
a
mocking
finger
tapped
on
the
windowpane
better
luck
to
the
two
on
yo
next
time
laughed
a
scornful
voice
and
david
ran
down
the
hill
toward
kenmuir
chapter
xii
how
red
wull
held
the
bridge
from
that
hour
the
fire
of
jealousy
blazed
into
a
mighty
flame
the
winning
of
the
dale
cup
had
become
a
mania
with
him
he
had
won
it
once
and
would
again
despite
all
the
moores
all
the
gray
dogs
all
the
undutiful
sons
in
existence
on
that
point
he
was
resolved
the
fact
of
his
having
tasted
the
joys
of
victory
served
to
whet
his
desire
and
now
he
felt
he
could
never
be
happy
till
the
cup
was
his
own
won
outright
at
home
david
might
barely
enter
the
room
there
the
trophy
stood
i
not
ha
ye
touch
ma
cup
ye
wastrel
wullie
and
me
won
it
you
naught
to
do
wi
it
go
you
to
james
moore
and
james
moore
ay
and
shall
i
tak
cup
wi
me
or
will
ye
bide
till
it
took
from
ye
so
the
two
went
on
and
every
day
the
tension
approached
nearer
in
the
dale
the
little
man
met
with
no
sympathy
the
hearts
of
the
dalesmen
were
to
a
man
with
owd
bob
and
his
master
whereas
once
at
the
sylvester
arms
his
shrill
ill
tongue
had
been
rarely
still
now
he
maintained
a
sullen
silence
jem
burton
at
least
had
no
cause
of
complaint
crouched
away
in
a
corner
with
red
wull
beside
him
the
little
man
would
sit
watching
and
listening
as
the
dalesmen
talked
of
owd
bob
doings
his
staunchness
sagacity
and
coming
victory
sometimes
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
then
he
would
spring
to
his
feet
and
stand
a
little
swaying
figure
and
denounce
them
passionately
in
almost
pathetic
eloquence
these
orations
always
concluded
in
set
fashion
ye
all
agin
us
the
little
man
would
cry
in
quivering
voice
we
are
that
tammas
would
answer
complacently
fair
means
or
foul
ye
content
sae
lang
as
wullie
and
me
are
beat
i
wonder
ye
dinna
poison
him
a
little
arsenic
and
the
way
clear
for
your
way
is
clear
enough
that
from
tammas
caustically
then
a
lengthy
silence
only
broken
by
that
exceeding
bitter
cry
eh
wullie
wullie
they
all
agin
us
and
always
the
rivals
red
and
gray
went
about
seeking
their
opportunity
but
the
master
with
his
commanding
presence
and
stern
eyes
was
ever
ready
for
them
toward
the
end
silent
and
sneering
would
secretly
urge
on
red
wull
to
the
attack
until
one
day
in
james
moore
turned
on
him
his
blue
eyes
glittering
think
yo
little
fule
he
cried
in
that
hard
voice
of
his
that
onst
they
got
set
we
should
iver
git
either
of
them
off
alive
it
seemed
to
strike
the
little
man
as
a
novel
idea
for
from
that
moment
he
was
ever
the
first
in
his
feverish
endeavors
to
oppose
his
small
form
between
the
combatants
curse
as
might
threaten
as
he
might
when
the
time
came
owd
bob
won
the
styles
of
the
rivals
were
well
contrasted
the
patience
the
insinuating
eloquence
combined
with
the
splendid
dash
of
the
one
and
the
fierce
driving
fury
of
the
other
the
issue
was
never
in
doubt
it
may
have
been
that
the
temper
of
the
tailless
tyke
gave
in
the
time
of
trial
it
may
have
been
that
his
sheep
were
wild
as
declared
certainly
not
as
the
little
man
alleged
in
choking
voice
that
they
had
been
chosen
and
purposely
set
aside
to
ruin
his
chance
certain
it
is
that
his
tactics
scared
them
hopelessly
and
he
never
had
them
in
hand
act
for
owd
bob
his
dropping
his
driving
his
penning
aroused
the
admiration
of
crowd
and
competitors
alike
he
was
patient
yet
persistent
quiet
yet
firm
and
seemed
to
coax
his
charges
in
the
right
way
in
that
inimitable
manner
of
his
own
when
at
length
the
verdict
was
given
and
it
was
known
that
after
an
interval
of
half
a
century
the
shepherds
trophy
was
won
again
by
a
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
there
was
such
a
scene
as
has
been
rarely
witnessed
on
the
slope
behind
the
dalesman
daughter
great
fists
were
slapped
on
mighty
backs
great
feet
were
stamped
on
the
banks
of
the
silver
lea
stalwart
lungs
were
strained
to
their
uttermost
capacity
and
roars
of
moore
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
the
gray
dogs
thundered
up
the
hillside
and
were
flung
thundering
back
even
james
moore
was
visibly
moved
as
he
worked
his
way
through
the
cheering
mob
and
owd
bob
trotting
alongside
him
in
quiet
dignity
seemed
to
wave
his
silvery
brush
in
acknowledgment
master
jacky
sylvester
alternately
turned
and
felled
the
hon

to
the
ground
lady
eleanour
her
cheeks
flushed
with
pleasure
waved
her
parasol
and
attempted
to
restrain
her
exuberance
parson
leggy
danced
an
unclerical
jig
and
shook
hands
with
the
squire
till
both
those
fine
old
gentlemen
were
purple
in
the
face
long
kirby
selected
a
small
man
in
the
crowd
and
bashed
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
while
tammas
rob
saunderson
tupper
hoppin
londesley
and
the
rest
joined
hands
and
went
raving
round
like
so
many
giddy
girls
of
them
all
however
none
was
so
uproarious
in
the
mad
heat
of
his
enthusiasm
as
david
he
stood
in
the
kenmuir
wagon
beside
maggie
a
conspicuous
figure
above
the
crowd
as
he
roared
in
hoarse
ecstasy
weel
done

yo
knocked
him
knock
him
agin
owd
bob
o

moore

hip
hip
until
the
noisy
young
giant
attracted
such
attention
in
his
boisterous
delight
that
maggie
had
to
lay
a
hand
upon
his
arm
to
restrain
his
violence
alone
on
the
far
bank
of
the
stream
stood
the
vanquished
pair
the
little
man
was
trembling
slightly
his
face
was
still
hot
from
his
exertions
and
as
he
listened
to
the
ovation
accorded
to
his
conqueror
there
was
a
piteous
set
grin
upon
his
face
in
front
stood
the
defeated
dog
his
lips
wrinkling
and
hackles
rising
as
he
too
saw
and
heard
and
understood
it
a
gran
thing

their
way
through

to

he
stood
there
alone
with
his
dog
watching
the
crowd
on
the
far
slope
as
it
surged
upward
in
the
direction
of
the
committee
tent
only
when
the
black
mass
had
packed
itself
in
solid
phalanges
about
that
ring
inside
which
just
a
year
ago
he
had
stood
in
very
different
circumstances
and
was
at
length
still
a
wintry
smile
played
for
a
moment
about
his
lips
he
laughed
a
mirthless
laugh
bide
a
wee
wullie

aft
agley
as
he
spoke
there
came
down
to
him
above
the
tumult
a
faint
cry
of
mingled
surprise
and
anger
the
cheering
ceased
abruptly
there
was
silence
then
there
burst
on
the
stillness
a
hurricane
of
indignation
the
crowd
surged
forward
then
turned
every
eye
was
directed
across
the
stream
a
hundred
damning
fingers
pointed
at
the
solitary
figure
there
there
were
hoarse
yells
of
there
he
be
yon
him
what
he
done
it
thief
throttle
him
the
mob
came
lumbering
down
the
slope
like
one
man
thundering
their
imprecations
on
a
thousand
throats
they
looked
dangerous
and
their
wrath
was
stimulated
by
the
knot
of
angry
dalesmen
who
led
the
van
there
was
more
than
one
white
face
among
the
women
at
the
top
of
the
slope
as
they
watched
the
crowd
blundering
blindly
down
the
hill
there
were
more
men
than
parson
leggy
the
squire
james
moore
and
the
local
constables
in
the
thick
of
it
all
striving
frantically
with
voice
and
gesture
ay
and
stick
too
to
stem
the
advance
it
was
useless
on
the
dark
wave
rolled
irresistible
on
the
far
bank
stood
the
little
man
motionless
awaiting
them
with
a
grin
upon
his
face
and
a
little
farther
in
front
was
the
tailless
tyke
his
back
and
neck
like
a
as
he
rumbled
a
vast
challenge
come
on
gentlemen
the
little
man
cried
come
on
i
bide
for
ye
never
fear
ye
a
thousand
to
one
and
a
dog
it
the
odds
ye
like
englishmen
and
the
mob
with
murder
in
its
throat
accepted
the
invitation
and
came
on
at
the
moment
however
from
the
slope
above
clear
above
the
tramp
of
the
multitude
a
great
voice
bellowed
way
way
way
for
trotter
the
advancing
host
checked
and
opened
out
and
the
secretary
of
the
meeting
bundled
through
he
was
a
small
fat
man
fussy
at
any
time
and
perpetually
perspiring
now
his
face
was
crimson
with
rage
and
running
he
gesticulated
wildly
vague
words
bubbled
forth
as
his
short
legs
twinkled
down
the
slope
the
crowd
paused
to
admire
some
one
shouted
a
witticism
and
the
crowd
laughed
for
the
moment
the
situation
was
saved
the
fat
secretary
hurried
on
down
the
slope
unheeding
of
any
insult
but
the
one
he
bounced
over
the
and
as
he
came
closer
saw
that
in
each
hand
brandished
a
brick
hoots
man
dinna
throw
he
cried
making
a
feint
as
though
to
turn
in
sudden
terror
what
this
what
this
gasped
the
secretary
waving
his
arms
bricks
seem
the
other
answered
staying
his
flight
the
secretary
puffed
up
like
a
pudding
in
a
hurry
where
the
cup
champion
challenge
he
jerked
out
mind
sir
you
responsible
wholly
responsible
dents
damages
delays
it
all
mean
sir
these
these
monstrous
creations
he
brandished
the
bricks
and
started

as

live
in
straw

in
the
cup
case
sir

cup
case
no

infamous
disgraceful
insult
me
meeting
committee
every
one
what
it
mean
sir
he
paused
to
pant
his
body
filling
and
emptying
like
a
bladder
approached
him
with
one
eye
on
the
crowd
which
was
heaving
forward
again
threatening
still
but
sullen
and
silent
i
pit
there
he
whispered
and
drew
back
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
disclosure
the
secretary
gasped
you
you
not
only
do
this
amazing
thing
these
monstrosities
he
hurled
the
bricks
furiously
on
the
unoffending
ground
but
you
dare
to
tell
me
so
the
little
man
smiled
wrang
and
conceal
it
do
right
and
confess
it
that
motto
and
mine
as
a
rule
but
this
time
i
had
ma
reasons
sir
no
reasons
can
justify
such
an
extraordinary
breach
of
all
the
the
decencies

the
reasons
of

maniac
not

more

your
precious

the
mob
with
tammas
and
long
kirby
at
their
head
had
now
well
nigh
reached
the
they
still
looked
dangerous
and
there
were
isolated
cries
of
duck

chuck
him
in
an
the

one
o
they
bricks
about
their
necks
there

gladly
forward
and
the
leaders
on
the
bridge
as
hastily
back
the
dog
galloped
on
to
the
rattling
plank
took
his
post
fair
and
square
in
the
centre
of
the
narrow
way
and
stood
facing
the
hostile
crew
like
cerberus
guarding
the
gates
of
hell
his
was
thrust
forward
hackles
up

and

an

struggle
betwixt
the
two

and
kicking
in

throes
of
mortal

first
a
tall
figure
came
forcing
through
the
crowd
his
face
a
little
paler
than
its
wont
and
a
formidable
in
his
hand
i

david

burly
gripping

and
forra
us
by
this
time
there
was
a
little
naked
space
of
green
round
the
like
a
fairy
circle
into
which
the
uninitiated
might
not
penetrate
round
this
the
mob
hedged
the
dalesmen
in
front
striving
knavishly
back
and
bawling
to
those
behind
to
leggo
that
shovin
and
these
latter
urging
valorously
forward
yelling
jeers
and
contumely
at
the
front
rank
come
on
afraid
lerrus
through
to
then
ye
royal
for
well
they
knew
the
impossibility
of
their
demand
and
as
they
wedged
and
jostled
thus
there
stole
out
from
their
midst
as
gallant
a
champion
as
ever
trod
the
grass
he
trotted
out
into
the
ring
the
observed
of
all
and
paused
to
gaze
at
the
gaunt
figure
on
the
bridge
the
sun
lit
the
sprinkling
of
snow
on
the
dome
of
his
head
one
forepaw
was
off
the
ground
and
he
stood
there
royally
alert
scanning
his
antagonist
th
owd
un
went
up
in
a
roar
fit
to
split
the
air
as
the
hero
of
the
day
was
recognized
and
the
dalesmen
gave
a
pace
forward
spontaneously
as
the
gray
stole
across
the
green
oor
bob
fetch
him
they
roared
their
blood
leaping
to
fever
heat
and
gripped
their
sticks
determined
in
stern
reality
to
follow
now
the
gray
champion
trotted
up
on
to
the
bridge
and
paused
again
the
long
hair
about
his
neck
rising
like
a
ruff
and
a
strange
glint
in
his
eyes
and
the
holder
of
the
bridge
never
moved
red
and
gray
stood
thus
face
to
face
the
one
gay
yet
resolute
the
other
motionless
his
great
head
slowly
sinking
between
his
forelegs
seemingly
petrified
there
was
no
shouting
now
it
was
time
for
deeds
not
words
only
above
the
stillness
came
a
sound
from
the
bridge
like
the
snore
of
a
giant
in
his
sleep
and
blending
with
it
a
low
deep
purring
thunder
like
some
monster
cat
well
pleased
wullie
came
a
solitary
voice
from
the
far
side
keep
the
bridge
one
ear
went
back
one
ear
was
still
forward
the
great
head
was
low
and
lower
between
his
forelegs
and
the
glowing
eyes
rolled
upward
so
that
the
watchers
could
see
the
murderous
white
forward
the
gray
dog
stepped
then
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
a
voice
stern
and
hard
came
ringing
down
from
the
slope
above
over
the
heads
of
the
many
bob
lad
coom
back
he
he
i
thocht
that
was
comin
sneered
the
small
voice
over
the
stream
the
gray
dog
heard
and
checked
bob
lad
coom
in
i
say
at
that
he
swung
round
and
marched
slowly
back
gallant
as
he
had
come
dignified
still
in
his
mortification
and
red
wull
threw
back
his
head
and
bellowed
a
paean
of
victory
challenge
triumph
scorn
all
blended
in
that
blare
in
the
mean
time
and
the
secretary
had
concluded
their
business
it
had
been
settled
that
the
cup
was
to
be
delivered
over
to
james
moore
not
later
than
the
following
saturday

at
the

as

and
trotted
off

hands
on
me

and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
forbye
wullie
the
with
that
the
little
man
strolled
off
leisurely
now
dallying
to
pick
a
flower
now
to
wave
a
mocking
hand
at
the
furious
mob
and
so
slowly
on
to
the
foot
of
the
muirk
muir
pass
there
he
turned
and
whistled
that
shrill
peculiar
note
wullie
wullie
to
me
he
called
at
that
with
one
last
threat
thrown
at
the
thousand
souls
he
had
held
at
bay
for
thirty
minutes
the
tailless
tyke
swung
about
and
galloped
after
his
lord
chapter
xiii
the
face
in
the
frame
all
friday
never
left
the
kitchen
he
sat
opposite
the
cup
in
a
coma
as
it
were
and
red
wull
lay
motionless
at
his
feet
saturday
came
and
still
the
two
never
budged
toward
the
evening
the
little
man
rose
all
in
a
tremble
and
took
the
cup
down
from
the
mantelpiece
then
he
sat
down
again
with
it
in
his
arms
eh

he
hugged
it
to
him
crying
silently
and
rocking
to
and
fro
like
a
mother
with
a
dying
child
and
red
wull
sat
up
on
his
haunches
and
weaved
from
side
to
side
in
sympathy
as
the
dark
was
falling
david
looked
in
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
the
little
man
swung
round
noiselessly
the
cup
nursed
in
his
arms
and
glared
sullen
and
suspicious
at
the
boy
yet
seemed
not
to
recognize
him
in
the
david
could
see
the
tears
coursing
down
the
little
wizened
face
ma
life
he
gaein

his
comment
as
he
turned
away
to
kenmuir

he
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
great
dog
rose
with
him
his
voice
heightened
to
a
scream
and
he
swayed
with
the
cup
in
his
arms
till
it
seemed
he
must
fall

he
banged
the
cup
down
on
the
table
and
rushed
madly
out
of
the
room
red
wull
at
his
heels
in
a
moment
he
came
running
back
brandishing
a
great
axe
about
his
head
come
on
wullie
he
cried
wha
hae
noo
the
day
and
the
hour
come
on
on
the
table
before
him
serene
and
beautiful
stood
the
target
of
his
madness
the
little
man
ran
at
it
swinging
his
murderous
weapon
like
a
flail
oor
or
naebody
wullie
come
on
the
proud
usurpers
low
he
aimed
a
mighty
buffet
and
the
shepherds
trophy
the
shepherds
trophy
which
had
won
through
the
hardships
of
a
hundred
years
was
almost
gone
it
seemed
to
quiver
as
the
blow
fell
but
the
cruel
steel
missed
and
the
sank
into
the
wood
clean
and
deep
like
a
spade
in
snow
red
wull
had
leapt
on
to
the
table
and
in
his
cavernous
voice
was
grumbling
a
chorus
to
his
master
yells
the
little
man
danced
up
and
down
tugging
and
straining
at
the
you
and
i
wullie
fall
in
every
foe
liberty
in
every
blow
the
was
as
immoveable
as
the
muir
pike
us
do
or
die
the
shaft
snapped
and
the
little
man
tottered
back
red
wull
jumped
down
from
the
table
and
in
doing
so
brushed
against
the
cup
it
over
on
to
the
floor
and
rolled
tinkling
away
in
the
dust
and
the
little
man
fled
madly
out
of
the
house
still
screaming
his
you
may
see
the
dent
in
the
cup
white
sides
to
this
day
when
late
that
night
returned
home
the
cup
was
gone
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
traced
out
its
path
plain
to
see
where
it
had
rolled
along
the
dusty
floor
beyond
that
there
was
no
sign
at
first
he
was
too
much
overcome
to
speak
then
he
raved
round
the
room
like
a
derelict
ship
red
wull
following
uneasily
behind
he
cursed
he
blasphemed
he
screamed
and
beat
the
walls
with
feverish
hands
a
stranger
passing
might
well
have
thought
this
was
a
private
bedlam
at
last
exhausted
he
sat
down
and
cried
it
david
wullie
ye
may
depend
david
that
robbed
his
hoose
oh
it
a
grand
thing
to

a
dutiful
son
and
he
bowed
his
gray
head
in
his
hands
david
indeed
it
was
he
had
come
back
to
the
grange
during
his
father
absence
and
taking
the
cup
from
its
grimy
bed
had
marched
it
away
to
its
rightful
home
for
that
evening
at
kenmuir
james
moore
had
said
to
him
david
your
father
not
sent
the
cup
i
shall
come
and
fetch
it
and
david
knew
he
meant
it
therefore
in
order
to
save
a
collision
between
his
father
and
his
friend
a
collision
the
issue
of
which
he
dared
hardly
contemplate
knowing
as
he
did
the
unalterable
determination
of
the
one
and
the
lunatic
passion
of
the
other
the
boy
had
resolved
to
fetch
the
cup
himself
then
and
there
in
the
teeth
if
needs
be
of
his
father
and
the
tailless
tyke
and
he
had
done
it
when
he
reached
home
that
night
he
marched
contrary
to
his
wont
straight
into
the
kitchen
there
sat
his
father
facing
the
door
awaiting
him
his
hands
upon
his
knees
for
once
the
little
man
was
alone
and
david
brave
though
he
was
thanked
heaven
devoutly
that
red
wull
was
elsewhere
for
a
while
father
and
son
kept

watching

another

david
he
paused
and
looked
the
boy
over
from
bead
to
foot
so
ye
not
only
an
idler
a
wastrel
a
liar
he
spat
the
words
out
ye
god

a
thief
i
no

the
boy
returned
hotly
i
did
but
give

mon
what

feyther
shame

wrongfully

cried
the

his
rights
from
a

ay

say

and
he
looked
his
father
in
the
face
with
flashing
eyes
i
the
thief
am
i
cried
the
other
incoherent
with
passion
though
ye
three
times
ma
size
i
teach
ma
son
to
speak
so
to
the
old
strap
now
long
disused
hung
in
the
chimney
corner
as
he
spoke
the
little
man
sprang
back
ripped
it
from
the
wall
and
almost
before
david
realized
what
he
was
at
had
brought
it
down
with
a
savage
slash
across
his
son
shoulders
and
as
he
smote
he
whistled
a
shrill
imperative
note
wullie
wullie
to
me
david
felt
the
blow
through
his
coat
like
a
bar
of
hot
iron
laid
across
his
back
his
passion
seethed
within
him
every
vein
throbbed
every
nerve
quivered
in
a
minute
he
would
wipe
out
once
and
for
all
the
score
of
years
for
the
moment
however
there
was
urgent
business
on
hand
for
outside
he
could
hear
the
quick
patter
of
feet
and
the
scurry
of
a
huge
creature
racing
madly
to
a
call
with
a
bound
he
sprang
at
the
open
door
and
again
the
strap
came
lashing
down
and
a
wild
voice
quick
wullie
for
god
sake
quick
david
slammed
the
door
to
it
shut
with
a
rasping
snap
and
at
the
same
moment
a
great
body
from
without
thundered
against
it
with
terrific
violence
and
a
deep
voice
roared
like
the
sea
when
thwarted
of
its
prey
too
late
agin
said
david
breathing
hard
and
shot
the
bolt
home
with
a
clang
then
he
turned
on
his
father
noo
said
he
man
to
man
ay
cried
the
other
father
to
son
the
little
man
half
turned
and
leapt
at
the
old
musketoon
hanging
on
the
wall
he
missed
it
turned
again
and
struck
with
the
strap
full
at
the
other
face
david
caught
the
falling
arm
at
the
wrist
hitting
it
aside
with
such
tremendous
force
that
the
bone
all
but
snapped
then
he
smote
his
father
a
terrible
blow
on
the
chest
and
the
little
man
staggered
back
gasping
into
the
corner
while
the
strap
dropped
from
his
numbed
fingers
outside
red
wull
whined
and
scratched
but
the
two
men
paid
no
heed
david
strode
forward
there
was
murder
in
his
face
the
little
man
saw
it
his
time
was
come
but
his
bitterest
foe
never
impugned
adam
courage
he
stood
huddled
in
the
corner
all
dishevelled
nursing
one
arm
with
the
other
entirely
unafraid
mind
david
he
said
quite
calm
murder
be
not
murder
be
the
boy
answered
in
thick
low
voice
and
was
across
the
room
outside
red
wull
banged
and
clawed
high
up
on
the
door
with
impotent
pats
the
little
man
suddenly
slipped
his
hand
in
his
pocket
pulled
out
something
and
flung
it
the
missile
pattered
on
his
son
face
like
a
on
a
charging
bull
and
david
smiled
as
he
came
on
it
dropped
softly
on
the
table
at
his
side
he
looked
down
and
it
was
the
face
of
his
mother
which
gazed
up
at
him
mither
he
sobbed
stopping
short
mither
ma
god
ye
saved
him
and
me
he
stood
there
utterly
unhinged
shaking
and
whimpering
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
pulled
himself
together
then
he
walked
to
the
wall
took
down
a
pair
of
shears
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
still
trembling
near
him
lay
the
miniature
all
torn
and
crumpled
and
beside
it
the
he
picked
up
the
strap
and
began
cutting
it
into
little
pieces
there
and
there
and
there
he
said
with
each
snip
an
ye
hit
me
agin
there
may
be
no
mither
to
save
stood
huddling
in
the
corner
he
shook
like
an
aspen
leaf
his
eyes
blazed
in
his
white
face
and
he
still
nursed
one
arm
with
the
other
honor
yer
father
he
quoted
in
small
low
voice

iv
the
black
killer

minutes
before

and
slowly
the

resume
their
seats
with
hoarse
throats
and
red
faces
gentlemen
a
a
little
unconsidered
man
is
standing
up
at

back
of

room
his
face
is
aflame
and
his

twitch
spasmodically
and

resumes
his

unwillingly
the
little
man
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
remains
silent
waiting
for
his
challenge
to

taken
up
it
is
in

as
he
looks
at

of

as

he
seizes

from

at
his
side
englishmen

cries
waving

before

here
a
health

a

adam
red

he
pauses
the
pewter
at
his
lips
and
looks
at
his
audience
with
flashing
eyes
there
is
no
response
from
them

he
raises
the
tankard
and
drains
it
to
its
uttermost
dreg
then
drawing
himself
up
he
addresses
his
audience
once
more
an
noo
i
warn
ye
aince
and
for
a
and
ye
may
tell
james
moore
i
said

he
may
plot
agin
us
wullie
and
me
he
may
threaten
us
he
may
win
the
cup
outright
for
his
muckle
favorite
but
there
was
niver
a
man
or
dog
yet
as
did
adam
and
his
red
wull
a
hurt
but
in
the
end
he
his
mither
hadna
borne
a
little
later
and
he
walks
out
of
the
inn
the
tailless
tyke
at
his
heels
after
he
is
gone
it
is
rob
saunderson
who
says
the
little
mon
mad
he
stop
at
nothin
and
tammas
who
answers
nay
not
even
the
little
man
had
aged
much
of
late
his
hair
was
quite
white
his
eyes
unnaturally
bright
and
his
hands
were
never
still
as
though
he
were
in
everlasting
pain
he
looked
the
picture
of
disease
after
owd
bob
second
victory
he
had
become
morose
and
untalkative
at
home
he
often
sat
silent
for
hours
together
drinking
and
glaring
at
the
place
where
the
cup
had
been
sometimes
he
talked
in
low
eerie
voice
to
red
wull
and
on
two
occasions
david
turning
suddenly
had
caught
his
father
glowering
stealthily
at
him
with
such
an
expression
on
his
face
as
chilled
the
boy
blood
the
two
never
spoke
now
and
david
held
this
silent
deadly
enmity
far
worse
than
the
perpetual
warfare
it
was
the
same
at
the
sylvester
arms
the
little
man
sat
alone
with
red
wull
exchanging
words
with
no
man
drinking
steadily
brooding
over
his
wrongs
only
now
and
again
galvanized
into
sudden
action
other
people
than
tammas
thornton
came
to
the
conclusion
that
would
stop
at
nothing
in
the
undoing
of
james
moore
or
the
gray
dog
they
said
drink
and
disappointment
had
turned
his
head
that
he
was
mad
and
dangerous
and
on
new
year
day
matters
seemed
coming
to
a
crisis
for
it
was
reported
that
in
the
gloom
of
a
snowy
evening
he
had
drawn
a
knife
on
the
master
in
the
high
street
but
slipped
before
he
could
accomplish
his
fell
purpose
most
of
them
all
david
was
haunted
with
an
anxiety
as
to
the
little
man
intentions
the
boy
even
went
so
far
as
to
warn
his
friend
against
his
father
but
the
master
only
smiled
grimly
thank
ye
lad
he
said
but
i
we
can
for
oorsel
bob
and
eh
owd
un
anxious
as
david
might
be
he
was
not
so
anxious
as
to
be
above
taking
a
mean
advantage
of
this
state
of
strained
apprehension
to
work
on
maggie
fears
one
evening
he
was
escorting
her
home
from
church
when
just
before
they
reached
the
larch
copse
goo
sakes
what
that
he
ejaculated
in
accents
starting
back
what
davie
cried
the
girl
shrinking
up
to
him
all
in
a
tremble
couldna
say
for
sure
it
mought
be
owt
or
agin
it
mought
be
nowt
but
yo
grip
my
arm
i
grip
yo
maggie
demurred
canst
see
onythin
she
asked
still
in
a
flutter
the
wheer
theer
pointing
vaguely
i
canna
see
why
theer
lass
can
yo
not
see
then
yo
pit
your
head
along
mine
so
closer
then
in
aggrieved
tones
whativer
is
the
matter
wi
yo
wench
i
might
be
a
but
the
girl
was
walking
away
with
her
head
high
as
the
pike
so
long
as
i
live
david
she
cried
i
niver
go
to
church
wi
you
agin
iss
but
you
will
though
onst
he
answered
low
maggie
whisked
round
in
a
flash
superbly
indignant
what
mean
yo
know
what
i
mean
lass
he
replied
sheepish
and
shuffling
before
her
queenly
anger
she
looked
him
up
and
down
and
down
and
up
again
i
niver
speak
to
you
agin
she
cried
not
if
it
was
ever
so
nay
i
walk
home
by
myself
thank
you
i
ha
nowt
to
do
wi
so
the
two
must
return
to
kenmuir
one
behind
the
other
like
a
lady
and
her
footman
david
audacity
had
more
than
once
already
all
but
caused
a
rupture
between
the
pair
and
the
occurrence
behind
the
hedge
set
the
cap
on
his
impertinences
that
was
past
enduring
and
maggie
by
her
bearing
let
him
know
it
david
tolerated
the
girl
new
attitude
for
exactly
twelve
minutes
by
the
kitchen
clock
then
sulk
wi
me
indeed
i
teach
her
and
he
marched
out
of
the
door
niver
to
cross
it
agin
ma
word
afterward
however
he
relented
so
far
as
to
continue
his
visits
as
before
but
he
made
it
clear
that
he
only
came
to
see
the
master
and
hear
of
owd
bob
doings
on
these
occasions
he
loved
best
to
sit
on
the
outside
the
kitchen
and
talk
and
chaff
with
tammas
and
the
men
in
the
yard
feigning
an
uneasy
bashfulness
when
reference
made
to
bessie
bolstock
and
after
sitting
thus
for
some
time
he
would
half
turn
look
over
his
shoulder
and
remark
in
indifferent
tones
to
the
girl
within
oh
i
forgot
yo
and
then
resume
his
conversation
while
the
girl
within
her
face
a
little
pinker
her
lips
a
little
tighter
and
her
chin
a
little
higher
would

business
pretending
neither
to

the
suspicions
that
nourished
dark
designs
against
james
moore
were
somewhat
confirmed
in
that
on
several
occasions
in
the
bitter
dusks
of
january
afternoons
a
little
insidious
figure
was
reported
to
have
been
seen
lurking
among
the
of
kenmuir
once
todd
caught
the
little
man
fairly
skulking
away
in
the
woodshed
took
him
up
bodily
and
carried
him
down

slope
to
the
wastrel
shaking
him
gently
as

went
across

put

and
the
little

slunk
silently
away
for
a
time
he
appeared
there
no
more
then
one
evening
when
it
was
almost
dark
james
moore
going
the
round
of
the
outbuildings
felt
owd
bob
stiffen
against
his
side
what
oop

he
whispered
halting
and
dropping
his

on
the
old
dog

a
ruff
of
rising
hair
beneath

steady
lad

he
whispered
what
is
he
peered
forward
into
the
gloom
and
at
length
discerned
a
little
familiar
figure
huddled
away
in
the
crevice
between
two
stacks
it
yo
is
it
he
said
and
bending
seized
a
wisp
of
owd
bob
coat
in
a
grip
like
a
vice
then
in
a
great
voice
moved
to

he
stood
there
in
the
dusk
tall
and
mighty
a
terrible
figure
one
hand
pointing
to
the
gate
the
other
still
grasping
the
gray
dog
the
little
man
scuttled
away
in
the
and
out
of
the
yard
on

he
turned
and
shook

at
the
darkening

death
on
the
marches
on
the
top
of
this
there
followed
an
attempt
to
poison
th
owd
un
at
least
there
was
no
other
accounting
for
the
affair
in
the
dead
of
a
night
james
moore
was
waked
by
a
low
moaning
beneath
his
room
he
leapt
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
to
see
his
favorite
dragging
about
the
moonlit
yard
the
dark
head
down
the
proud
tail
for
once
lowered
the
lithe
limbs
wooden
heavy
unnatural
altogether
pitiful
in
a
moment
he
was
downstairs
and
out
to
his
friend
assistance
whativer
owd
un
he
cried
in
anguish
at
the
sound
of
that
dear
voice
the
old
dog
tried
to
struggle
to
him
could
not
and
fell
whimpering
in
a
second
the
master
was
with
him
examining
him
tenderly
and
crying
for
who
slept
above
the
stables
there
was
every
symptom
of
foul
play
the
tongue
was
swollen
and
almost
black
the
breathing
labored
the
body
twitched
horribly
and
the
soft
gray
eyes
all
bloodshot
and
straining
in
agony
with
the
aid
of
and
maggie
drenching
first
and
stimulants
after
the
master
pulled
him
around
for
the
moment
and
soon
jim
mason
and
parson
leggy
hurriedly
summoned
came
running
to
the
rescue
prompt
and
stringent
measures
saved
the
victim
but
only
just
for
a
time
the
best
in
the
north
was
pawing
at
the
gate
of
death
in
the
end
as
the
gray
dawn
broke
the
danger
passed
the
attempt
to
get
at
him
if
attempt
it
was
aroused
passionate
indignation
in
the
countryside
it
seemed
the
of
the
excitement
long
bubbling
there
were
no
traces
of
the
culprit
not
a
vestige
to
lead
to
incrimination
so
cunningly
had
the
criminal
accomplished
his
foul
task
but
as
to
the
perpetrator
if
there
where
no
proofs
there
were
yet
fewer
doubts
at
the
sylvester
arms
long
kirby
asked
for
his
explanation
of
the
matter
hoo
do
i
for
it
the
little
man
cried
i
dinna
for
it
then
hoo
did
it
happen
asked
tammas
with
asperity
i
dinna
believe
it
did
happen
the
little
man
replied
it
a
lee
o
james
moore
a
characteristic
whereon
they
chucked
him
out
incontinently
for
the
terror
for
once
was
elsewhere
now
that
afternoon
is
to
be
remembered
for
threefold
causes
firstly
because
as
has
been
said
was
alone
secondly
because
a
few
minutes
after
his
ejectment
the
window
of
the
was
thrown
open
from
without
and
the
little
man
looked
in
he
spoke
no
word
but
those
dim
smouldering
eyes
of
his
wandered
from
face
to
face
resting
for
a
second
on
each
as
if
to
burn
them
on
his
memory
i
remember
ye
gentlemen
he
said
at
length
quietly
shut
the
window
and
was
gone
thirdly
for
a
reason
now
to
be
told
though
ten
days
had
elapsed
since
the
attempt
on
him
the
gray
dog
had
never
been
his
old
self
since
he
had
attacks
of
shivering
his
vitality
seemed
sapped
he
tired
easily
and
great
heart
would
never
own
it
at
length
on
this
day
james
moore
leaving
the
old
dog
behind
him
had
gone
over
to
to
consult
dingley
the
vet
on
his
way
home
he
met
jim
mason
with
gyp
the
faithful
betsy
unworthy
successor
at
the
dalesman
daughter
together
they
started
for
the
long
tramp
home
over
the
marches
and
that
journey
is
marked
with
a
red
stone
in
this
story
all
day
long
the
hills
had
been
bathed
in
impenetrable
fog
throughout
there
had
been
an
accompanying
drizzle
and
in
the
distance
the
wind
had
moaned
a
to
the
darkness
of
the
day
was
added
the
sombreness
of
falling
night
as
the
three
began
the
ascent
of
the
murk
muir
pass
by
the
time
they
emerged
into
the
devil
bowl
it
was
altogether
black
and
blind
but
the
threat
of
wind
had
passed
leaving
utter
stillness
and
they
could
hear
the
splash
of
an
otter
on
the
far
side
of
the
lone
tarn
as
they
skirted
that
gloomy
water
edge
when
at
length
the
last
steep
rise
on
to
the
marches
had
been
topped
a
breath
of
soft
air
smote
them
lightly
and
the
curtain
of
fog
began
drifting
away
the
two
men
swung
steadily
through
the
heather
with
that
reaching
stride
the
birthright
of
and
highlanders
they
talked
but
little
for
such
was
their
nature
a
word
or
two
on
sheep
and
the
approaching
thence
on
to
the
coming
trials
the
shepherds
trophy
owd
bob
and
the
attempt
on
him
and
from
that
to
and
the
tailless
tyke
had
a
hand
i
the
postman
was
asking
nay
there
no
ceptin
he
mad
to
get
shut
o
th
owd
un
afore
cup
im
or
me
it
mak
no
differ
for
a
dog
is
disqualified
from
competing
for
the
trophy
who
has
changed
hands
during
the
six
months
prior
to
the
meeting
and
this
holds
good
though
the
change
be
only
from
father
to
son
on
the
decease
of
the
jim
looked
up
inquiringly
at
his
companion
think
it
coom
to
that
he
asked
what
why
not
if
i
can
help
it
the
other
answered
grimly
the
fog
had
cleared
away
by
now
and
the
moon
was
up
to
their
right
on
the
crest
of
a
rise
some
two
hundred
yards
away
a
low
wood
stood
out
black
against
the
sky
as
they
passed
it
a
blackbird
rose
up
screaming
and
a
brace
of
winged
noisily
away
hullo
hark
to
the
yammerin
muttered
jim
stopping
and
at
this
time
o
night
too
some
rabbits
playing
in
the
moonlight
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
sat
up
listened
and
hopped
back
into
security
at
the
same
moment
a
big
slunk
out
of
the
covert
he
stole
a
pace
forward
and
halted
listening
with
one
ear
back
and
one
pad
raised
then
cantered
silently
away
in
the
gloom
passing
close
to
the
two
men
and
yet
not
observing
them
what
up
i
wonder
mused
the
postman
the
fox
set
clackerin
i
said
the
master
not
he
he
was
scared
oot
o
his
skin
the
other
answered
then
in
tones
of
suppressed
excitement
with
his
hands
on
james
moore
arm
and
theer
ma
gyp
on
us
there
indeed
on
the
crest
of
the
rise
beside
the
wood
was
the
little
lurcher
now
looking
back
at
his
master
now
creeping
stealthily
forward
ma
word
theer
summat
wrong
yonder
cried
jim
and
jerked
the
off
his
shoulder
coom
on
master
and
he
set
off
running
toward
the
dog
while
james
moore
himself
excited
now
followed
with
an
agility
that
belied
his
years
some
score
yards
from
the
lower
edge
of
the
spinney
upon
the
farther
side
of
the
ridge
a
tiny
beck
babbled
through
its
bed
of
peat
the
two
men
as
they
topped
the
rise
noticed
a
flock
of
clustered
in
the
dip
wood
and
stream
they
stood
martialled
in
close
array
facing
half
toward
the
wood
half
toward
the
newcomers
heads
up
eyes
glaring
handsome
as
sheep
only
look
when
scared
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
two
men
halted
beside
gyp
the
postman
stood
with
his
head
a
little
forward
listening
intently
then
he
dropped
in
the
heather
like
a
dead
man
pulling
the
other
with
him
doon
mon
he
whispered
clutching
at
gyp
with
his
spare
hand
what
jim
asked
the
master
now
thoroughly
roused
summat
movin
i
th
wood
the
other
whispered
listening
so
they
lay
motionless
for
a
while
but
there
came
no
sound
from
the
copse
was
nowt
the
postman
at
length
allowed
peering
cautiously
about
and
yet
i
thowt
i
dunno
reetly
what
i
then
starting
to
his
knees
with
a
hoarse
cry
of
terror
save
us
what
yon
theer
then
for
the
first
time
the
master
raised
his
head
and
noticed
lying
in
the
gloom
between
them
and
the
array
of
sheep
a
still
white
heap
james
moore
was
a
man
of
deeds
not
words
it
past
waitin
he
said
and
sprang
forward
his
heart
in
his
mouth
the
sheep
stamped
and
shuffled
as
he
came
and
yet
did
not
break
ah
thanks
be
he
cried
dropping
beside
the
motionless
body
a
as
he
spoke
his
hands
wandered
deftly
over
the
carcase
but
what
this
he
called
she
was
as
me
look
at
her
fleece
crisp
close
strong
feel
the
flesh
firm
as
a
rock
and
a
bone
broke
ne
a
scrat
on
her
body
a
pin
could
mak
as
healthy
as
a
mon
and
yet
dead
as
mutton
stout
hearty
jim
still
trembling
from
the
horror
of
his
fear
came
up
and
knelt
beside
his
friend
ah
but
there
bin
devilry
in
this
he
said
i
they
sheep
had
bin
badly
skeared
and
not
so
long
sure
enough
the
other
answered
no
fox
doin
a
as
could
knock
a
jim
hands
travelled
from
the
body
to
the
dead
creature
throat
he
screamed
by
gob
master
look
theer
he
held
his
hand
up
in
the
moonlight
and
it
dripped
red
and
warm
yet
warm
tear
some
bracken
jim
ordered
the
other
and
set
alight
we
mun
see
to
the
postman
did
as
bid
for
a
moment
the
fern
smouldered
and
smoked
then
the
flame
ran
crackling
along
and
shot
up
in
the
darkness
weirdly
lighting
the
scene
to
the
right
the
low
wood
a
block
of
solid
blackness
against
the
sky
in
front
the
wall
of
sheep
staring
out
of
the
gloom
with
bright
eyes
and
as
that
still
white
body
with
the
kneeling
men
and
lurcher
sniffing
tentatively
round
the
victim
was
subjected
to
a
critical
examination
the
throat
and
that
only
had
been
hideously
mauled
from
the
raw
wounds
the
flesh
hung
in
horrid
shreds
on
the
ground
all
about
were
little
pitiful
dabs
of
wool
wrenched
off
apparently
in
a
struggle
and
crawling
among
the
a
track
of
red
led
down
to
the
stream
a
dog
doin
and
no
mistakin
thot
said
jim
at
length
after
a
minute
inspection
ay
declared
the
master
with
slow
emphasis
and
a
too
and
an
old
un
or
i
no
the
postman
looked
up
why
thot
he
asked
puzzled
becos
the
master
answered
as
did
this
killed
for
blood
and
for
blood
only
if
had
bin
ony
other
dog
greyhound
bull
tarrier
or
even
a
young
think
he
ha
stopped
wi
the
one
not
he
he
ha
gone
through
and
be
runnin
as
like
as
not
yet
nippin
pullin
down
till
he
maybe
killed
the
half
but
as
did
this
killed
for
blood
i
say
he
got
it
killed
just
the
one
and
nary
touched
the
others
jim
the
postman
whistled
long
and
low
it
just
what
owd
wrottesley
tell
on
he
said
i
never
half
believed
him
then
i
do
now
though
mind
what
th
owd
tell
master
james
moore
nodded
thot
it
i
never
seen
the
like
afore
myself
but
i
heard
ma
grandad
speak
mony
the
time
an
owd
dog
git
the
cravin
for
sheep
blood
on
him
just
the
same
as
a
mon
does
for
the
drink
he
creeps
oot
o
nights
gallops
afar
hunts
his
sheep
downs
and
satisfies
the
cravin
and
he
nary
kills
but
the
one
they
say
for
he
knows
the
value
o
sheep
same
as
you
and
me
he
has
his
gallop
quenches
the
thirst
and
then
he
for
home
maybe
a
score
mile
away
and
no
one
the
wiser
i
th
mornin
and
so
on
till
he
cooms
to
a
bloody
death
the
murderin
if
he
does
said
jim
and
he
does
they
say
nigh
always
for
he
gets
bolder
and
bolder
not
bein
caught
until
one
fine
night
a
bullet
lets
light
into
him
and
some
mon
gets
knocked
nigh
endways
when
they
bring
his
best
tyke
home
th
mornin
dead
wi
the
sheep
wool
yet
stickin
in
his
the
postman
whistled
again
it
what
owd
wrottesley
tell
on
to
a
tick
and
he
say
if
ye
mind
master
as
hoo
the
dog
niver
kill
his
master
sheep
kind
ay
i
heard
that
said
the
master
queer
too
and
bein
such
a
bad
un
jim
mason
rose
slowly
from
his
knees
ma
word
he
said
i
wish
th
owd
un
was
here
he
show
us
summat
i
wish
he
was
pore
owd
lad
said
the
master
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
crash
in
the
wood
above
them
a
sound
as
of
some
big
body
bursting
furiously
through
brushwood
the
two
men
rushed
to
the
top
of
the
rise
in
the
darkness
they
could
see
nothing
only
standing
still
and
holding
their
breaths
they
could
hear
the
faint
sound
ever
growing
fainter
of
some
creature
splashing
in
a
hasty
gallop
over
the
wet
moors
yon
him
yon
no
fox
i
tak
oath
and
a
main
big
un
too
hark
to
him
cried
jim
then
to
gyp
who
had
rushed
off
in
hot
pursuit
coom
back
what
use
o
you
agin
a
gallopin
potamus
gradually
the
sounds
died
away
and
away
and
were
no
more
thot
the
devil
said
the
master
at
length
nay
the
devil
has
a
tail
they
do
say
replied
jim
thoughtfully
for
already
the
light
of
suspicion
was
focusing
its
red
glare
noo
i
we
in
for
bloody
times
amang
the
sheep
for
a
while
said
the
master
as
jim
picked
up
his
bags
better
a
sheep
nor
a
mon
answered
the
postman
still
harping
on
the
old
theme
chapter
xvi
the
black
killer
that
as
james
moore
had
predicted
was
the
first
only
of
a
long
succession
of
such
solitary
crimes
those
who
have
not
lived
in
a
desolate
country
like
that
about
the
muir
pike
where
sheep
are
paramount
and
every
other
man
engaged
in
the
profession
pastoral
can
barely
imagine
the
sensation
aroused
in
market
place
tavern
or
cottage
the
subject
of
conversation
was
always
the
latest
and
the
criminal
sometimes
there
would
be
a
lull
and
the
shepherds
would
begin
to
breathe
more
freely
then
there
would
come
a
stormy
night
when
the
heavens
were
veiled
in
the
cloak
of
crime
and
the
wind
moaned
fitfully
over
meres
and
marches
and
another
victim
would
be
added
to
the
lengthening
list
it
was
always
such
black
nights
nights
of
wind
and
weather
when
no
man
would
be
abroad
that
the
murderer
chose
for
his
bloody
work
and
that
was
how
he
became
known
from
the
red
screes
to
the
muir
pike
as
the
black
killer
in
the
daleland
they
still
call
a
wild
wet
night
a
black
killer
night
for
they
say
his
ghaist
be
oot
the
there
was
hardly
a
farm
in
the
countryside
but
was
marked
with
the
seal
of
blood
kenmuir
escaped
and
the
grange
rob
saunderson
at
the
holt
and
tupper
at
swinsthwaite
and
they
were
about
the
only
lucky
ones
as
for
kenmuir
tammas
declared
with
a
certain
grim
pride
he
knows
to
coom
wheer
th
owd
un
whereat
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
internal
spasms
rubbing
his
knees
and
cackling
insanely
for
a
afterward
and
as
for
the
luck
of
the
grange
well
there
was
a
reason
for
that
too
so
the
dalesmen
said
though
the
area
of
crime
stretched
from
the
black
water
to
miles
there
was
never
a
sign
of
the
perpetrator
the
killer
did
his
bloody
work
with
a
thoroughness
and
a
devilish
cunning
that
defied
detection
it
was
plain
that
each
murder
might
be
set
down
to
the
same
agency
each
was
stamped
with
the
same
unmistakable
one
sheep
killed
its
throat
torn
into
red
ribands
and
the
others
untouched
it
was
at
the
instigation
of
parson
leggy
that
the
squire
imported
a
bloodhound
to
track
the
killer
to
his
doom
set
on
at
a
fresh
killed
carcase
at
the
one
tree
knowe
he
carried
the
line
a
distance
in
the
direction
of
the
muir
pike
then
was
thrown
out
by
a
little
bustling
beck
and
never
acknowledged
the
scent
again
afterward
he
became
unmanageable
and
could
be
no
further
utilized
then
there
was
talk
of
inducing
tommy
dobson
and
his
pack
to
come
over
from
eskdale
but
that
came
to
nothing
the
master
of
the
border
hunt
lent
a
couple
of
foxhounds
who
effected
nothing
and
there
were
a
hundred
other
attempts
and
as
many
failures
jim
mason
set
a
cunning
trap
or
two
and
caught
his
own
and
a
terrible
wigging
from
his
missus
ned
hoppin
sat
up
with
a
gun
two
nights
over
a
new
slain
victim
and
londesley
of
the
home
farm
poisoned
a
carcase
but
the
killer
never
returned
to
the
kill
and
went
about
in
the
midst
of
the
all
carrying
on
his
infamous
traffic
and
laughing
up
his
sleeve
in
the
meanwhile
the
dalesmen
raged
and
swore
vengeance
their
impotence
their
unsuccess
and
their
losses
heating
their
wrath
to
madness
and
the
bitterest
sting
of
it
all
lay
in
this
that
though
they
could
not
detect
him
they
were
nigh
to
positive
as
to
the
culprit
many
a
time
was
the
black
killer
named
in
conclave
many
a
time
did
long
kirby
as
he
stood
in
the
border
ram
and
watched
and
the
terror
walking
down
the
high
nudge
jim
mason
and
whisper
theer
the
killer
oneasy
be
his
grave
to
which
practical
jim
always
made
the
same
retort
ay
theer
the
killer
but
wheer
the
proof
and
therein
lay
the
crux
there
was
scarcely
a
man
in
the
countryside
who
doubted
the
guilt
of
the
tailless
tyke
but
as
jim
said
where
was
the
proof
they
could
but
point
to
his
nickname
his
evil
notoriety
say
that
magnificent
as
he
was
he
was
known
even
in
his
work
as
a
rough
handler
of
stock
and
lastly
remark
significantly
that
the
grange
was
one
of
the
few
farms
that
had
so
far
escaped
unscathed
for
with
the
belief
that
the
black
killer
was
a
they
held
it
as
an
article
of
faith
that
he
would
in
honour
spare
his
master
flock
there
may
indeed
have
been
prejudice
in
their
judgement
for
each
has
his
private
grudge
against
the
terror
and
nigh
every
man
bore
on
his
own
person
or
his
clothes
or
on
the
body
of
his
dog
the
mark
of
that
huge
savage
proof
why
he
near
killed
ma
lassie
cries
londesley
and
he
did
kill
the

tammas
yo

watch
the
old
man
slips
out
of
the
and
in
another
moment
from
the
road
without
comes
a
heavy
regular
as
of
some
big
creature
approaching
and
blending
with
the
sound
little
shuffling
footsteps
in
an
instant
every
dog
in
the
room
has
risen
to
his
feet
and
stands
staring
at
the
door
with
sullen
glowing
eyes
lips
wrinkling
bristles
rising
throats
rumbling
an
unsteady
hand
fumbles
at
the
door
a
reedy
voice
calls
wullie
come
here
and
the
dogs
move
away
surly
to
either
side
of
the
fireplace
tails
down
ears
back
grumbling
still
the
picture
of
cowed
passion
then
the
door
opens
tammas
enters
grinning
and
each
after
a
scrutiny
resumes
his
former
position
before
the
fire
meanwhile
over
seemingly
all
unsuspicious
of
these
suspicions
a
change
had
come
whether
it
was
that
for
the
time
he
heard
less
of
the
best
in
the
north
or
for
some
more
occult
reason
certain
it
is
that
he
became
his
old
self
his
tongue
wagged
as
gayly
and
bitterly
as
ever
and
hardly
a
night
passed
but
he
infuriated
tammas
almost
to
blows
with
his
innuendoes
and
insidious
sarcasms
old
jonas
maddox
one
evening
at
the
sylvester
arms
inquired
of
him
what
his
notion
was
as
to
the
identity
of
the
killer
i
hae
ma
suspicions
maddox
i
hae
ma
suspicions
the
little
man
replied
cunningly
wagging
his
head
and
giggling
but
more
than
that
they
could
not
elicit
from
him
a
week
later
however
to
the
question
and
what
are
yo
thinkin
o
this
black
killer
why
the
little
man
asked
earnestly
why
mair
than
white
or
we
say
luckily
for
him
however
the
dalesmen
are
slow
of
wit
as
of
speech
david
too
marked
the
difference
in
his
father
who
nagged
at
him
now
and
then
with
all
the
old
spirit
at
first
he
rejoiced
in
then
change
preferring
his
outward
and
open
warfare
to
that
aforetime
stealthy
enmity
but
soon
he
almost
wished
the
other
back
for
the
older
he
grew
the
more
difficult
did
he
find
it
to
endure
calmly
these
everlasting
bickerings
for
one
reason
he
was
truly
glad
of
the
altered
condition
of
affairs
he
believed
that
for
the
nonce
at
least
his
father
had
abandoned
any
ill
designs
he
might
have
cherished
against
james
moore
those
sneaking
visits
to
kenmuir
were
he
hoped
discontinued
yet
maggie
moore
had
she
been
on
speaking
terms
with
him
could
have
undeceived
him
for
one
night
when
alone
in
the
kitchen
on
suddenly
looking
up
she
had
seen
to
her
horror
a
dim
moonlike
face
glued
against
the
windowpane
in
the
first
mad
panic
of
the
moment
she
almost
screamed
and
dropped
her
work
then
a
true
moore
controlled
herself
and
sat
feigning
to
work
yet
watching
all
the
while
it
was
she
recognized
that
the
face
pale
in
its
framework
of
black
the
hair
lying
dank
and
dark
on
his
forehead
and
the
white
eyelids
blinking
slow
regular
horrible
she
thought
of
the
stories
she
had
heard
of
his
sworn
vengeance
on
her
father
and
her
heart
stood
still
though
she
never
moved
at
length
with
a
gasp
of
relief
she
discerned
that
the
eyes
were
not
directed
on
her
stealthily
following
their
gaze
she
saw
they
rested
on
the
shepherds
trophy
and
on
the
cup
they
remained
fixed
immovable
while
she
sat
motionless
and
watched
an
hour
it
seemed
to
her
elapsed
before
they
shifted
their
direction
and
wandered
round
the
room
for
a
second
they
dwelt
upon
her
then
the
face
withdrew
into
the
night
maggie
told
no
one
what
she
had
seen
knowing
well
how
terrible
her
father
was
in
his
anger
she
deemed
it
wiser
to
keep
silence
while
as
for
david
she
would
never
speak
to
him
again
and
not
for
a
moment
did
that
young
man
surmise
whence
his
father
came
when
on
the
night
in
question
returned
to
the
grange
chuckling
to
himself
david
was
growing
of
late
accustomed
to
these
fits
of
silent
unprovoked
merriment
and
when
his
father
began
giggling
and
muttering
to
red
wull
at
first
he
paid
no
heed
he
he
wullie
aiblins
we
beat
him
yet
there
many
a
slip
twixt
cup
and
lip
eh
wullie
he
he
and
he
made
allusion
to
the
flourishing
of
the
wicked
and
their
fall
ending
always
with
the
same
refrain
he
he
wullie
aiblins
we
beat
him
in
this
strain
he
continued
until
david
his
patience
exhausted
asked
roughly
what
yo
mumblin
aboot
wha
is
it
yo
beat
you
and
yer
wullie
the
lad
tone
was
as
contemptuous
as
his
words
long
ago
he
had
cast
aside
any
semblance
of
respect
for
his
father
only
rubbed
his
knees
and
giggled
hark
to
the
dear
lad
wullie
listen
hoo
pleasantly
he
addresses
his
auld
dad
then
turning
on
his
son
and
leering
at
him
what
is
it
ye
ask
wha
should
it
be
but
the
black
killer
wha
else
is
there
i
be
wushin
to
hurt
the
black
killer
echoed
the
boy
and
looked
at
his
father
in
amazement
now
david
was
almost
the
only
man
in
who
denied
red
identity
with
the
killer
nay
he
said
once
he
kill
me
given
half
a
chance
but
a
sheep
yet
though
himself
of
this
opinion
he
knew
well
what
the
talk
was
and
was
astonished
accordingly
at
his
remark
the
black
killer
is
it
what
know
o
the
killer
he
inquired
why
i
wad
ken
why
the
little
man
asked
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
now
david
though
repudiating
in
the
village
red
wull
complicity
with
the
crimes
at
home
was
never
so
happy
as
when
casting
cunning
innuendoes
to
that
effect
what
would
you
have
him
then
he
asked
red
yaller
colour
and
he
stared
significantly
at
the
tailless
tyke
who
was
lying
at
his
master
feet
the
little
man
ceased
rubbing
his
knees
and
eyed
the
boy
david
shifted
uneasily
beneath
that
dim
persistent
stare
well
he
said
at
length
gruffly
the
little
man
giggled
and
his
two
thin
hands
took
up
their
task
again
aiblins
his
puir
auld

chuckled

if

heavily
punctuated
by
the
speaker
the

stopped

what

he
asked
softly

the

and
it
aiblins
just
as

in

accents
that
i
he
began
rubbing
and
giggling

david
rose
from

chair
and
walked
across
the
room
to
where
his
father
sat
if
yo

sic
a
mighty
heap
he
shouted

stopped
stroking

and
looked
up

dear

with
a

snarl
of
bitterness
that
you

vairy
last
person
i
wad
chapter
xvii
a
mad
dog
david
and
maggie
meanwhile
were
drifting
further
and
further
apart
he
now
thought
the
girl
took
too
much
upon
herself
that
this
assumption
of
the
woman
and
the
mother
was
overdone
once
on
a
sunday
he
caught
her
hearing
andrew
his
catechism
he
watched
the
performance
through
a
crack
in
the
door
and
listened
giggling
to
her
simple
teaching
at
length
his
merriment
grew
so
boisterous
that
she
looked
up
saw
him
and
straightway
rising
to
her
feet
crossed
the
room
and
shut
the
door
tendering
her
unspoken
rebuke
with
such
a
sweet
dignity
that
he
slunk
away
for
once
decently
ashamed
and
the
incident
served
to
add
point
to
his
hostility
consequently
he
was
seldom
at
kenmuir
and
more
often
at
home
quarrelling
with
his
father
since
that
day
two
years
before
when
the
boy
had
been
an
instrument
in
the
taking
of
the
cup
from
him
father
and
son
had
been
like
two
vessels
charged
with
electricity
contact
between
which
might
result
at
any
moment
in
a
shock
and
a
flash
this
was
the
outcome
not
of
a
moment
but
of
years
of
late
the
contest
had
raged
markedly
fierce
for
noticed
his
son
more
frequent
presence
at
home
and
commented
on
the
fact
in
his
usual
spirit
of
playful
raillery
what
come
to
ye
david
he
asked
one
day
yer
auld
dad
head
is
nigh
turned
wi
yer
condescension
is
james
moore
feared
ye
steal
the
cup
fra
him
as
ye
stole
it
from
me
that
he
not
ha
ye
at
kenmuir
or
what
is
it
i
thought
i
could
maybe
keep
an
eye
on
the
killer
gin
i
stayed
here
david
answered
leering
at
red
wull
ye
do
better
at
kenmuir
eh
wullie
the
little
man
replied
nay
the
other
answered
he
not

owd
un
to

to
him
there
o
the
little
man
whipped
round
are
ye
so
sure
he
is
there
o
nights
ma
lad
he
asked
with
slow
significance
he
was
there
when
some
one
i
dinna
say
who
though
i
have
ma
thoughts
tried
to
poison
him
sneered
the
boy
mimicking
his
manner
shook
his
head
if
he
was
poisoned
and
noo
i
think
aiblins
he
was
he
didna
pick
it
up
at
kenmuir
i
tell
ye
that
he
said
and
marched
out
of
the
room
in
the
mean
time
the
black
killer
pursued
his
bloody
trade
unchecked
the
public
always
greedy
of
a
new
sensation
took
up
the
matter
in
several
of
the
great
dailies
articles
on
the
agrarian
outrages
appeared
followed
by
lengthy
correspondence
controversy
raged
high
each
correspondent
had
his
own
theory
and
his
own
solution
of
the
problem
and
each
waxed
indignant
as
his
were
discarded
for
another
the
terror
had
reigned
already
two
months
when
with
the
advent
of
the
matters
took
a
yet
more
serious
aspect
it
was
bad
enough
to
lose
one
sheep
often
the
finest
in
the
pack
but
the
hunting
of
a
flock
at
a
critical
moment
which
was
incidental
to
the
slaughter
of
the
one
the
scaring
of
these
woolly
almost
out
of
their
fleeces
spelt
for
the
small
farmers
something
akin
to
ruin
for
the
bigger
ones
a
loss
hardly
bearable
such
a
woful
season
had
never
been
known
loud
were
the
curses
deep
the
vows
of
revenge
many
a
shepherd
at
that
time
patrolled
all
night
through
with
his
dogs
only
to
find
in
the
morning
that
the
killer
had
slipped
him
and
havocked
in
some
secluded
portion
of
his
beat
it
was
heartrending
work
and
all
the
more
so
in
that
though
his
incrimination
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
there
was
still
the
same
positiveness
as
to
the
culprit
identity
long
kirby
indeed
greatly
daring
went
so
far
on
one
occasion
as
to
say
to
the
little
man
and
the
killer
is
a
i
do
the
little
man
replied
with
conviction
and
that
he
spare
his
own
sheep
niver
a
doubt
of
then
said
the
smith
with
a
nervous
cackle
it
must
lie
between
you
and
tupper
and
the
little
man
leant
forward
and
tapped
the
other
on
the
arm
or
kenmuir
ma
friend
he
said
ye
forgot
so
i
have
laughed
the
smith
so
i
then
i
not
anither
time
the
other
continued
still
tapping
mind
kenmuir
d
see
kirby
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
when
the
killer
was
working
his
worst
that
the
dalesmen
had
a
lurid
glimpse
of
adam
as
he
might
be
were
he
wounded
through
his
wullie
thus
it
came
about
it
was
in
and
in
the
border
ram
old
rob
saunderson
was
the
centre
of
interest
for
on
the
previous
night
rob
who
till
then
had
escaped
unscathed
had
lost
a
sheep
to
the
killer
and
far
worse
his
flock
of
herdwicks
heavy
in
lamb
had
been
galloped
with
disastrous
consequences
the
old
man
with
tears
in
his
eyes
was
telling
how
on
four
nights
that
week
he
had
been
up
with
shep
to
guard
against
mishap
and
on
the
fifth
worn
out
with
his
double
labor
had
fallen
asleep
at
his
post
but
a
very
little
while
he
slumbered
yet
when
in
the
dawn
he
woke
and
hurried
on
his
rounds
he
quickly
came
upon
a
mangled
sheep
and
the
pitiful
relic
of
his
flock
a
relic
indeed
for
all
about
were
cold
wee
lambkins
and
their
mothers
dead
and
dying
of
exhaustion
and
their
unripe
travail
a
slaughter
of
the
innocents
the
dalesmen
were
clustered
round
the
old
shepherd
listening
with
lowering
countenances
when
a
dark
gray
head
peered
in
at
the
door
and
two
wistful
eyes
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
the
speaker
talk
o
the
devil
muttered
but
no
man
heard
him
for
red
wull
too
had
seen
that
sad
face
and
rising
from
his
master
feet
had
leapt
with
a
roar
at
his
enemy
toppling
jim
mason
like
a
ninepin
in
the
fury
of
his
charge
in
a
second
every
dog
in
the
room
from
the
battered
venus
to
big
rasper
was
on
his
feet
bristling
to
have
at
the
tyrant
and
wipe
out
past
injuries
if
the
gray
dog
would
but
lead
the
dance
it
was
not
to
be
however
for
long
kirby
was
standing
at
the
door
with
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
in
his
hand
barely
had
he
greeted
the
gray
dog
with
ullo
owd
un
when
hoarse
yells
of
lad
the
terror
mingled
with
red
wull
roar
half
turning
he
saw
the
great
dog
bounding
to
the
attack
straightway
he
flung
the
boiling
contents
of
his
cup
full
in
that
countenance
the
burning
liquid
swished
against
the
huge
blinding
bubbling
scalding
it
did
its
fell
work
well
nothing
escaped
that
merciless
torrent
with
a
cry
of
agony
half
bellow
half
howl
red
wull
checked
in
his
charge
from
without
the
door
was
banged
to
and
again
the
duel
was
postponed
while
within
the
a
huddle
of
men
and
dogs
were
left
alone
with
a
mad
man
and
a
madder
brute
blind
demented
agonized
the
tailless
tyke
thundered
about
the
little
room
gnashing
snapping
oversetting
men
tables
chairs
swirled
off
their
legs
as
though
they
had
been
dolls
he
spun
round
like
a
monstrous
teetotum
he
banged
his
tortured
head
against
the
wall
he
burrowed
into
the
unyielding
floor
and
all
the
while
pattered
after
him
laying
hands
upon
him
only
to
be
flung
aside
as
a
terrier
flings
a
rat
now
up
now
down
again
now
tossed
into
a
corner
now
dragged
upon
the
floor
yet
always
following
on
and
crying
in
supplicating
tones
wullie
wullie
let
me
to

let

and
then
with
a
scream
and
a
murderous
glance
by
kirby
i
deal
wi
you
later
the
uproar
was
like
hell
let
loose
you
could
hear
the
noise
of
oaths
and
blows
as
the
men
fought
for
the
door
a
away
and
above
it
the
horrid
bellowing
and
the
screaming
of
that
shrill
voice
long
kirby
was
the
first
man
out
of
that
and
after
him
the
others
toppled
one
by
one
men
and
dogs
jostling
one
another
in
the
frenzy
of
their
fear
big
bell
londesley
tupper
hoppin

and
trembling
and
old
saunderson
they
pulled
out
by
his
heels
then
the
door
was
shut
with
a
clang
and
the
little
man
and
mad
dog
were
left
alone
in
the
street
was
already
a
crowd
attracted
by
the
uproar
while
at
the
door
was
james
moore
seeking
entrance
happen
i
could
lend
the
little
mon
a
hand
said
he
but
they
withheld
him
forcibly
inside
was
pandemonium
bangings
like
the
doors
of
hell
the
bellowing
of
that
great
voice
the
patter
of
little
feet
the
slithering
of
a
body
on
the
floor
and
always
that
shrill
beseeching
prayer
wullie
wullie
let

to

and
in
a
scream
by
kirby
i
be

soon
jim
mason
it
was
who
turned
at
length
to
the
smith
and
whispered
kirby
lad
yo
best
skip
the
big
man
obeyed
and
ran
the
of
his
feet
on
the
hard
road
rang
above
the
turmoil
as
the
long
legs
vanished
round
the
corner
and
the
sound
of
the
fugitive
died
away
a
panic
seized
the
listening
crowd
a
woman
shrieked
a
girl
fainted
and
in
two
minutes
the
street
was
as
naked
of
men
as
the
steppes
of
russia
in
winter
here
a
white
face
at
a
window
there
a
door
ajar
and
peering
round
a
far
corner
a
frightened
boy
one
man
only
scorned
to
run
alone
james
moore
stalked
down
the
centre
of
the
road
slow
and
calm
owd
bob
trotting
at
his
heels
it
was
a
long
before
the
door
of
the
inn
burst
open
and
came
out
with
a
run
flinging
the
door
behind
him
he
rushed
into
the
middle
of
the
road
his
sleeves
were
rolled
at
the
wrist
like
a
surgeon
and
in
his
right
hand
was
a
noo
by
he
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
where
is
he
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
darting
his
fiery
glances
everywhere
and
his
face
was
whiter
than
his
hair
then
he
turned
and
hunted
madly
down
the
whole
length
of
the
high
nosing
like
a
weasel
in
every
cranny
stabbing
at
the
air
as
he
went
and
screaming
by
kirby
wait
till
i
get
ye
chapter
xviii
how
the
killer
was
singed
no
further
harm
came
of
the
incident
but
it
served
as
a
healthy
for
the
dalesmen
a
coincidence
it
may
have
been
but
as
a
fact
for
the
fortnight
succeeding
kirby
exploit
there
was
a
lull
in
the
crimes
there
followed
as
though
to
make
amends
the
seven
days
still
remembered
in
the
daleland
as
the
bloody
week
on
the
sunday
the
squire
lost
a
cheviot
ewe
killed
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
manor
wall
on
the
monday
a
farm
on
the
black
water
was
marked
with
the
red
cross
on
tuesday
a
black
night
tupper
at
swinsthwaite
came
upon
the
murderer
at
his
work
he
fired
into
the
darkness
without
effect
and
the
killer
escaped
with
a
scaring
on
the
following
night
viscount
birdsaye
lost
a
shearling
ram
for
which
he
was
reported
to
have
paid
a
fabulous
sum
thursday
was
the
one
blank
night
of
the
week
on
friday
tupper
was
again
visited
and
punished
heavily
as
though
in
revenge
for
that
shot
on
the
saturday
afternoon
a
big
meeting
was
held
at
the
manor
to
discuss
measures
the
squire
presided
gentlemen
and
magistrates
were
there
in
numbers
and
every
farmer
in
the
to
start
the
proceedings
the
special
commissioner
read
a
futile
letter
from
the
board
of
agriculture
after
him
viscount
birdsaye
rose
and
proposed
that
a
reward
more
suitable
to
the
seriousness
of
the
case
than
the
paltry
pounds
of
the
police
should
be
offered
and
backed
his
proposal
with
a
pound
cheque
several
others
spoke
and
last
of
all
parson
leggy
rose
he
briefly
summarized
the
history
of
the
crimes
reiterated
his
belief
that
a
was
the
criminal
declared
that
nothing
had
occurred
to
shake
his
conviction
and
concluded
by
offering
a
remedy
for
their
consideration
simple
it
was
so
he
said
to
laughableness
yet
if
their
surmise
was
correct
it
would
serve
as
an
effectual
preventive
if
not
cure
and
would
at
least
give
them
time
to
turn
round
he
paused
my
suggestion
is
that
every
of
you
who
owns
a
ties
him
up
at
the
farmers
were
given
half
an
hour
to
consider
the
proposal
and
clustered
in
knots
talking
it
over
many
an
eye
was
directed
on
but
that
little
man
appeared
all
unconscious
weel
saunderson
he
was
saying
in
shrill
accents
and
shall
ye
tie
shep
what
think
asked
rob
eying
the
man
at
whom
the
measure
was
aimed
why
it
this
way
i
thinkin
the
little
man
replied
gin
ye
haud
shep
the
guilty
one
i
by
all
manner
o
means
or
shootin
be
aiblins
better
if
not
why
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
and
having
shown
his
hand
and
driven
the
nail
well
home
the
little
man
left
the
meeting
james
moore
stayed
to
see
the
parson
resolution
negatived
by
a
large
majority
and
then
he
too
quitted
the
hall
he
had
foreseen
the
result
and
previous
to
the
meeting
had
warned
the
parson
how
it
would
be
tie
up
he
cried
almost
indignantly
as
owd
bob
came
galloping
up
to
his
whistle
i
think
i
see
myself
chainin
yo
owd
lad
like
any
murderer
why
it
yo
has
kept
the
killer
off
kenmuir
so
far
at
the
was
for
once
without
his
familiar
spirit
playing
with
the
child
for
the
little
man
loved
all
children
but
his
own
and
was
beloved
of
them
as
the
master
approached
he
looked
up
weel
moore
he
called
and
are
you
gaein
to
tie
yer
dog
i
will
if
you
will
yours
the
master
answered
grimly
na
the
little
man
replied
it
wullie
as
frichts
the
killer
aff
the
grange
that
why
i
left
him
there
it
the
same
wi
me
the
master
said
he
not
come
to
kenmuir
yet
nor
he
not
so
long
as
th
owd
un
loose
i
loose
or
tied
for
the
matter
o
that
the
little
man
rejoined
kenmuir
he
made
the
statement
dogmatically
snapping
his
lips
the
master
frowned
why
that
he
asked
ha
ye
no
heard
what
they
sayin
the
little
man
inquired
with
raised
eyebrows
nay
what
why
that
the
mere
repitation
o
th
best
in
the
should
keep
him
aff
an
i
guess
they
reet
and
he
laughed
shrilly
as
he
spoke
the
master
passed
on
puzzled
which
road
are
ye
gaein
hame
called
after
him
because
with
a
polite
smile
i
tak
i
off
by
the
windy
brae
the
master
answered
striding
on
squire
asked
me
to
leave
a
note
wi
his
shepherd
side
o
the
so
he
headed
away
to
the
left
making
for
home
by
the
route
along
the
silver
mere
it
is
a
long
sweep
of
almost
unbroken
moorland
the
windy
brae
sloping
gently
down
in
mile
on
mile
of
heather
from
the
mere
marches
on
the
top
to
the
fringe
of
the
silver
mere
below
in
all
that
waste
of
moor
the
only
break
is
the
giant
chair
puzzle
of
geologists
looking
as
though
plumped
down
by
accident
in
the
heathery
wild
the
ground
rises
suddenly
from
the
uniform
grade
of
the
brae
up
it
goes
ever
growing
steeper
until
at
length
it
runs
abruptly
into
a
sheer
curtain
of
rock
the
fall
which
rises
perpendicular
some
forty
feet
on
the
top
of
which
rests
that
tiny
grassy
bowl
not
twenty
yards
across
they
call
the
scoop
the
scoop
forms
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
reposes
on
its
collar
of
rock
cool
and
green
and
out
of
the
world
like
wine
in
a
metal
cup
in
front
is
the
fall
behind
rising
sheer
again
the
wall
of
rock
which
makes
the
back
of
the
chair
inaccessible
from
above
the
only
means
of
entrance
to
that
little
dell
are
two
narrow
which
crawl
dangerously
up
between
the
sheer
wall
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sheer
fall
on
the
other
entering
it
at
opposite
sides
it
stands
out
from
the
gradual
incline
that
peculiar
eminence
yet
as
the
master
and
owd
bob
debouched
on
to
the
brae
it
was
already
invisible
in
the
darkening
night
through
the
heather
the
two
swung
the
master
thinking
now
with
a
smile
of
david
and
maggie
wondering
what
had
meant
musing
with
a
frown
on
the
killer
pondering
on
his
identity
for
he
was
half
of
david
opinion
as
to
red
wull
innocence
and
thanking
his
stars
that
so
far
kenmuir
had
escaped
a
piece
of
luck
he
attributed
entirely
to
the
vigilance
of
th
owd
un
who
sleeping
in
the
porch
slipped
out
at
all
hours
and
went
his
rounds
warding
off
danger
and
at
the
thought
he
looked
down
for
the
dark
head
which
should
be
travelling
at
his
knee
yet
could
not
see
it
so
thick
hung
the
pall
of
night
so
he
brushed
his
way
along
and
ever
the
night
grew
blacker
until
from
the
swell
of
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
he
knew
himself
skirting
the
giant
chair
now
as
he
sped
along
the
foot
of
the
rise
of
a
sudden
there
burst
on
his
ear
the
myriad
patter
of
galloping
feet
he
turned
and
at
the
second
a
swirl
of
sheep
almost
bore
him
down
it
was
and
they
fled
furiously
by
yet
he
dimly
discovered
driving
at
their
trails
a
vague
form
the
killer
by
thunder
he
ejaculated
and
startled
though
he
was
struck
down
at
that
last
pursuing
shape
to
miss
and
almost
fall
bob
lad
he
cried
follow
on
and
swung
round
but
in
the
darkness
could
not
see
if
the
gray
dog
had
obeyed
the
chase
swept
on
into
the
night
and
far
above
him
on
the
he
could
now
hear
the
rattle
of
the
flying
feet
he
started
hotly
in
pursuit
and
then
recognizing
the
futility
of
following
where
he
could
not
see
his
hand
desisted
so
he
stood
motionless
listening
and
peering
into
the
blackness
hoping
th
owd
un
was
on
the
heels
he
prayed
for
the
moon
and
as
though
in
answer
the
lantern
of
the
night
shone
out
and
lit
the
dour
face
of
the
chair
above
him
he
shot
a
glance
at
his
feet
and
thanked
heaven
on
finding
the
gray
dog
was
not
beside
him
then
he
looked
up
the
sheep
had
broken
and
were
scattered
over
the
steep
still
galloping
madly
in
the
rout
one
pair
of
darting
figures
caught
and
held
his
gaze
the
foremost
dodging
twisting
speeding
upward
the
hinder
hard
on
the
leader
heels
swift
remorseless
never
changing
he
looked
for
a
third
pursuing
form
but
none
could
he
discern
he
mun
ha
missed
him
in
the
dark
the
master
muttered
the
sweat
standing
on
his
brow
as
he
strained
his
eyes
upward
higher
and
higher
sped
those
two
dark
specks
far
the
scattered
remnant
of
the
flock
up
and
up
until
of
a
sudden
the
sheer
fall
dropped
its
relentless
barrier
in
the
path
of
the
fugitive
away
scudding
along
the
foot
of
the
struck
the
familiar
track
leading
to
the
scoop
and
up
it
bleating
pitifully
nigh
spent
the
killer
hard
on
her
now
he
doon
her
in
the
scoop
cried
the
master
hoarsely
following
with
fascinated
eyes
owd
un
owd
un
wheer
iver
are
yo
gotten
to
he
called
in
agony
but
no
owd
un
made
reply
as
they
reached
the
summit
just
as
he
had
prophesied
the
two
black
dots
were
one
and
down
they
rolled
together
into
the
hollow
of
the
scoop
out
of
the
master
ken
at
the
same
instant
the
moon
as
though
loth
to
watch
the
last
act
of
the
bloody
play
veiled
her
face
it
was
his
chance
noo
and
up
the
hillside
he
sped
like
a
young
man
girding
his
loins
for
the
struggle
the
slope
grew
steep
and
steeper
but
on
and
on
he
held
in
the
darkness
gasping
painfully
yet
running
still
until
the
face
of
the
fall
blocked
his
way
too
there
he
paused
a
moment
and
whistled
a
low
call
could
he
but
dispatch
the
old
dog
up
the
one
path
to
the
scoop
while
he
took
the
other
the
murderer
one
road
to
safety
would
be
blocked
he
waited
all
expectant
but
no
cold
muzzle
was
shoved
into
his
hand
again
he
whistled
a
pebble
from
above
almost
dropped
on
him
as
if
the
criminal
up
there
had
moved
to
the
brink
of
the
fall
to
listen
and
he
dared
no
more
he
waited
till
all
was
still
again
then
crept
along
the
and
hit
at
length
the
track
up
which
a
while
before
had
fled
killer
and
victim
up
that
ragged
way
he
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
the
perspiration
rolled
off
his
face
one
elbow
brushed
the
rock
perpetually
one
hand
plunged
ever
and
anon
into
that
naked
emptiness
on
the
other
side
he
prayed
that
the
moon
might
keep
in
but
a
little
longer
that
his
feet
might
be
saved
from
falling
where
a
slip
might
well
mean
death
certain
destruction
to
any
chance
of
success
he
cursed
his
luck
that
th
owd
un
had
somehow
missed
him
in
the
dark
for
now
he
must
trust
to
chance
his
own
great
strength
and
his
good
oak
stick
and
as
he
climbed
he
laid
his
plan
to
rush
in
on
the
killer
as
he
still
gorged
and
grapple
with
him
if
in
the
darkness
he
missed
and
in
that
narrow
arena
the
contingency
was
improbable
the
murderer
might
still
in
the
panic
of
the
moment
forget
the
one
path
to
safety
and
leap
over
the
fall
to
his
destruction
at
length
he
reached
the
summit
and
paused
to
draw
breath
the
black
void
before
him
was
the
scoop
and
in
its
bosom
not
ten
yards
away
must
be
lying
the
killer
and
the
killed
he
crouched
against
the
wet
and
listened
in
that
dark
silence
poised
heaven
and
earth
he
seemed
a
million
miles
apart
from
living
soul
no
sound
and
yet
the
murderer
must
be
there
ay
there
was
the
tinkle
of
a
dislodged
stone
and
again
the
tread
of
stealthy
feet
the
killer
was
moving
alarmed
was
off
quick
he
rose
to
his
full
height
gathered
himself
and
leapt
something
collided
with
him
as
he
sprang
something
wrestled
madly
with
him
something
wrenched
from
beneath
him
and
in
a
clap
he
heard
the
thud
of
a
body
striking
ground
far
below
and
the
slithering
and
splattering
of
some
creature
speeding
furiously
down
the
and
away
who
the
blazes
roared
he
what
the
devil
screamed
a
little
voice
the
moon
shone
out
moore
and
there
they
were
still
struggling
over
the
body
of
a
dead
sheep
in
a
second
they
had
disengaged
and
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
fall
in
the
quiet
they
could
still
hear
the
scrambling
hurry
of
the
fugitive
far
below
them
nothing
was
to
be
seen
however
save
an
array
of
startled
sheep
on
the
mute
witnesses
of
the
murderer
escape
the
two
men
turned
and
eyed
each
other
the
one
grim
the
other
sardonic
both
dishevelled
and
suspicious
well
weel
a
pause
and
careful
scrutiny
there
blood
on
your
and
on
together
they
walked
hack
into
the
little
moonlit
hollow
there
lay
the
murdered
sheep
in
a
pool
of
blood
plain
it
was
to
see
whence
the
marks
on
their
coats
came
touched
the
victim
head
with
his
foot
the
movement
exposed
its
throat
with
a
shudder
he
replaced
it
as
it
was
the
two
men
stood
back
and
eyed
one
another
what
are
yo
doin
here
after
the
killer
what
are
you
after
the
killer

did
you
come
up

him
but
for
i
did

tore
me
aff
a
pause
again
where
yer
gray
dog
this
time
the
challenge
was
unmistakable
i
sent
him
after
the
killer
wheer
your
red
wull
at
hame
as
i
ye
yo
mean

left
him
there
fingers

he
where

shoulders
and

began
when

when
the
killer
came
ye
wad
say

then

dead
sheep

your
dog
here

over
the
fall

killer

or

only
beneath
me
i
felt
just
so
said
and
laughed
the
other
brow
contracted
an
that
was
a
big
un
he
said
slowly
the
little
man
stopped
his
cackling
there
ye
lie
he
said
smoothly
he
was
they
looked
one
another
full
in
the
eyes
that
a
matter
of
opinion
said
the
master
it
a
matter
of
fact
said
the
other
the
two
stared
at
one
another
silent
and
stern
each
trying
to
fathom
the
other
soul
then
they
turned
again
to
the
brink
of
the
fall
beneath
them
plain
to
see
was
the
splash
and
furrow
in
the
shingle
marking
the
killer
line
of
retreat
they
looked
at
one
another
again
and
then
each
departed
the
way
he
had
come
to
give
his
version
of
the
story
th
owd
un
had
kept
wi
me
i
should
ha
had
and
i
tell
ye
i
did
have
him
but
james
moore
pulled
me
aff
strange
too
his

chapter
xix
lad
and
lass
an
immense
sensation
this
affair
of
the
scoop
created
in
the
daleland
it
spurred
the
dalesmen
into
fresh
endeavors
james
moore
and
were
examined
and
as
to
the
minutest
details
of
the
matter
the
whole
was
placarded
with
huge
bills
offering
pounds
reward
for
the
capture
of
the
criminal
dead
or
alive
while
the
vigilance
of
the
watchers
was
such
that
in
a
single
week
they
bagged
a
donkey
an
old
woman
and
two
amateur
detectives
in
the
near
escape
of
the
killer
the
collision
between
james
moore
and
adam
and
owd
bob
unsuccess
who
was
not
wont
to
fail
aroused
intense
excitement
with
which
was
mingled
a
certain
anxiety
as
to
their
favorite
for
when
the
master
had
reached
home
that
night
he
had
found
the
old
dog
already
there
and
he
must
have
wrenched
his
foot
in
the
pursuit
or
run
a
thorn
into
it
for
he
was
very
lame
whereat
when
it
was
reported
at
the
sylvester
arms
winked
at
red
wull
and
muttered
ah
forty
foot
is
an
ugly
a
week
later
the
little
man
called
at
kenmuir
as
he
entered
the
yard
david
was
standing
outside
the
kitchen
window
looking
very
glum
and
miserable
on
seeing
his
father
however
the
boy
started
forward
all
alert
what
want
here
he
cried
roughly
same
as
you
dear
lad
the
little
man
giggled
advancing
i
come
on
a
your
visits
to
kenmuir
are
usually
paid
by
night
so
i
heard
david
sneered
the
little
man
affected
not
to
hear
so
they
dinna
allow
ye
indoors
wi
the
cup
he
laughed
they
know
yer
little
ways
then
nay
i
not
wanted
in
there
david
answered
bitterly
but
not
so
loud
that
his
father
could
hear
maggie
within
the
kitchen
heard
however
but
paid
no
heed
for
her
heart
was
hard
against
the
boy
who
of
late
though
he
never
addressed
her
had
made
himself
as
unpleasant
in
a
thousand
little
ways
as
only
david
could
at
that
moment
the
master
came
stalking
into
the
yard
owd
bob
preceding
him
and
as
the
old
dog
recognized
his
visitor
he
bristled
involuntarily
at
the
sight
of
the
master
hurried
forward
i
did
but
come
to
ask
after
the
tyke
he
said
is
he
gettin
over
his
lameness
james
moore
looked
surprised
then
his
stern
face
relaxed
into
a
cordial
smile
such
generous
anxiety
as
to
the
welfare
of
red
wull
rival
was
a
wholly
new
characteristic
in
the
little
man
i
tak
it
kind
in
yo
he
said
to
come
and
is
the
thorn
oot
asked
the
little
man
with
eager
interest
shooting
his
head
forward
to
stare
closely
at
the
other
it
came
oot
last
night
wi
the
poulticin
the
master
answered
returning
the
other
gaze
calm
and
steady
i
glad
o
that
said
the
little
man
still
staring
but
his
yellow
grinning
face
said
as
plain
words
what
a
liar
ye
are
james
the
days
passed
on
his
father
taunts
and
gibes
always
becoming
more
bitter
drove
david
almost
to
distraction
he
longed
to
make
it
up
with
maggie
he
longed
for
that
tender
sympathy
which
the
girl
had
always
extended
to
him
when
his
troubles
with
his
father
were
heavy
on
him
the
quarrel
had
lasted
for
months
now
and
he
was
well
weary
of
it
and
utterly
ashamed
for
at
least
he
had
the
good
grace
to
acknowledge
that
no
one
was
to
blame
but
himself
and
that
it
had
been
fostered
solely
by
his
ugly
pride
at
length
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
determined
to
go
to
the
girl
and
ask
forgiveness
it
would
be
a
bitter
ordeal
to
him
always
unwilling
to
acknowledge
a
fault
even
to
himself
how
much
harder
would
it
be
to
confess
it
to
this
strip
of
a
girl
for
a
time
he
thought
it
was
almost
more
than
he
could
do
yet
like
his
father
once
set
upon
a
course
nothing
could
divert
him
so
after
a
week
of
doubts
and
determinations
of
cowardice
and
courage
he
pulled
himself
together
and
off
he
set
an
hour
it
took
him
from
the
grange
to
the
bridge
over
the
wastrel
an
hour
which
had
wont
to
be
a
quarter
now
as
he
walked
on
up
the
slope
from
the
stream
very
slowly
heartening
himself
for
his
penance
he
was
aware
of
a
strange
disturbance
in
the
yard
above
him
the
noisy
cackling
of
hens
the
snorting
of
pigs
disturbed
and
above
the
rest
the
cry
of
a
little
child
ringing
out
in
shrill
distress
he
set
to
running
and
sped
up
the
slope
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
as
he
took
the
gate
in
his
stride
he
saw
the
figure
of
wee
anne
fleeing
with
unsteady
toddling
steps
her
fair
hair
streaming
out
behind
and
one
bare
arm
striking
wildly
back
at
a
great
pursuing
sow
david
shouted
as
he
cleared
the
gate
but
the
brute
paid
no
heed
and
was
almost
touching
the
fugitive
when
owd
bob
came
galloping
round
the
corner
and
in
a
second
had
flashed
between
pursuer
and
pursued
so
close
were
the
two
that
as
he
swung
round
on
the
startled
sow
his
tail
brushed
the
baby
to
the
ground
and
there
she
lay
kicking
fat
legs
to
heaven
and
calling
on
all
her
gods
david
leaving
the
old
dog
to
secure
the
warrior
pig
ran
round
to
her
but
he
was
anticipated
the
whole
matter
had
barely
occupied
a
time
and
maggie
rushing
from
the
kitchen
now
had
the
child
in
her
arms
and
was
hurrying
back
with
her
to
the
house
eh
ma
pet
are
yo
hurted
dearie
david
could
hear
her
asking
tearfully
as
he
crossed
the
yard
and
established
himself
in
the
door
well
said
he
in
bantering
tones
yo
a
nice
wench
to
ha
charge
oor
annie
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
the
girl
and
well
he
knew
it
wee
anne
that
imp
of
mischief
was
forever
evading
her
eye
and
attempting
to
immolate
herself
more
than
once
she
had
only
been
saved
from
serious
hurt
by
the
watchful
devotion
of
owd
bob
who
always
found
time
despite
his
many
labors
to
keep
a
guardian
eye
on
his
lassie
in
the
previous
winter
she
had
been
lost
on
a
bitter
night
on
the
muir
pike
once
she
had
climbed
into
a
field
with
the
highland
bull
and
barely
escaped
with
her
life
while
the
gray
dog
held
the
brute
in
check
but
a
little
while
before
she
had
been
rescued
from
drowning
by
the
tailless
tyke
there
had
been
numerous
other
mischances
and
now
the
present
mishap
but
the
girl
paid
no
heed
to
her
tormentor
in
her
joy
at
finding
the
child
all
unhurt
theer
yo
bai
so
much
as
scratted
ma
precious
is
yo
she
cried
rin
oot
agin
then
and
the
baby
toddled
joyfully
away
maggie
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
with
face
averted
david
eyes
dwelt
lovingly
upon
her
admiring
the
pose
of
the
neat
head
with
its
thatch
of
pretty
brown
hair
the
slim
figure
and
slender
ankles
peeping
modestly
from
beneath
her
print
frock
ma

he
broke
off
into

quivered
and
the
flush
deepened
on
her
cheek
i

continued

and
releasing

little
drooping
face

earth
after
a
spring
shower
and
holding

between
his
two
big
hands

she

to
be

reminded
her
in
aggrieved
tones
i
niver

she
cried
more
indignant
than
truthful

when
we
was
little

that

i

as

at

over

however
that
might
be
he
was
keeking
at
her
from
closer
range
now
and
in
that
position
for
he
held
her
firmly
still
she
could
not
help
but
keek
back
he
looked
so
handsome
humble
for
once
penitent
yet
reproachful
his
own
eyes
a
little
moist
and
withal
his
old
audacious
self
that
despite
herself
her
anger
grew
less
hot
say
yo
forgie
me
and
i
let

she
answered
firmly
but
there
was
less
conviction
in
her
heart
than
voice
iss
yo
do
lass
he
coaxed
and
kissed
her
again
she
struggled
faintly
hoo
daur
yo
she
cried
through
her
tears
but
he
was
not
to
be
moved
will
yo
noo
he
asked
she
remained
dumb
and
he
kissed
her
again
impidence
she
cried
ay
said
he
closing
her
mouth
i
wonder
at
ye
davie
she
said
surrendering
after
that
maggie
must
needs
give
in
and
it
was
well
understood
though
nothing
definite
had
been
said
that
the
boy
and
girl
were
courting
and
in
the
dale
the
unanimous
opinion
was
that
the
young
couple
would
make
a
gradely
pair
was
the
last
person
to
hear
the
news
long
after
it
had
been
common
knowledge
in
the
village
it
was
in
the
sylvester
arms
he
first
heard
it
and
straightway
fell
into
one
of
those
foaming
frenzies
characteristic
of
him

he
might
ha
waited
till
his
auld
dad
was
gone
and
he
no
had
to
wait
lang
the
then
the
little
man
sat
down
and
burst
into
tears
gradually
however
he
resigned
himself
and
the
more
readily
when
he
realized
that
david
by
his
act
had
exposed
a
fresh
wound
into
which
he
might
plunge
his
barbed
shafts
and
he
availed
himself
to
the
full
of
his
new
opportunities
often
and
often
david
was
sore
pressed
to
restrain
himself
true
what
they
sayin
that
maggie

nae
better
than
she
should
be
the
little
man
asked
one
evening
with
anxious
interest

not

so
and
if
they
were

the
boy
answered
angrily
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
nodded
his
head

david
strode
across

close

chapter
xx
the
snapping
of
the
string
the
spring
was
passing
marked
throughout
with
the
bloody
trail
of
the
killer
the
adventure
in
the
scoop
scared
him
for
a
while
into
innocuousness
then
he
resumed
his
game
again
with
redoubled
zest
it
seemed
likely
he
would
harry
the
district
till
some
lucky
accident
carried
him
off
for
all
chance
there
was
of
arresting
him
you
could
still
hear
nightly
in
the
sylvester
arms
and
elsewhere
the
assertion
delivered
with
the
same
dogmatic
certainty
as
of
old
the
terror
i
tell
yo
and
that
irritating
inevitable
reply
ay
but
wheer
the
proof
while
often
at
the
same
moment
in
a
house
not
far
away
a
little
lonely
man
was
sitting
before
a
fire
rocking
to
and
fro
biting
his
nails
and
muttering
to
the
great
dog
whose
head
lay
between
his
knees
if
we
had
but
the
proof
wullie
if
we
had
but
the
proof
i
give
ma
right
hand
aff
my
arm
gin
we
had
the
proof
long
kirby
who
was
always
for
war
when
some
one
else
was
to
do
the
fighting
suggested
that
david
should
be
requested
in
the
name
of
the
dalesmen
to
tell
that
he
must
make
an
end
to
red
wull
but
jim
mason
quashed
the
proposal
remarking
truly
enough
that
there
was
too
much
bad
blood
as
it
was
between
father
and
son
while
tammas
proposed
with
a
sneer
that
the
smith
should
be
his
own
agent
in
the
matter
whether
it
was
this
remark
of
tammas
which
stung
the
big
man
into
action
or
whether
it
was
that
the
intensity
of
his
hate
gave
him
unusual
courage
anyhow
a
few
days
later
caught
him
lurking
in
the
granary
of
the
grange
the
little
man
may
not
have
guessed
his
murderous
intent
yet
the
blacksmith
terror
as
he
crouched
away
in
the
darkest
corner
could
hardly
have
escaped
remark
though
and
kirby
may
thank
his
stars
for
it
the
treacherous
gleam
of
a
behind
him
did
hullo
kirby
said
cordially
ye
stay
the
night
wi
me
and
the
next
thing
the
big
man
heard
was
a
giggle
on
the
far
side
the
door
lost
in
the
clank
of
padlock
and
rattle
of
chain
then
through
a
crack
to
ye
hope
ye
be
and
there
he
stayed
that
night
the
following
day
and
next
night
hours
in
all
with
swedes
for
his
hunger
and
the
dew
off
the
thatch
for
his
thirst
meanwhile
the
struggle
between
david
and
his
father
seemed
coming
to
a
head
the
little
man
tongue
wagged
more
bitterly
than
ever
now
it
was
never
at
rest
searching
out
sores
stinging
piercing
worst
of
all
he
was
continually
dropping
innuendoes
seemingly
innocent
enough
yet
with
a
world
of
subtile
meaning
at
their
back
respecting
maggie
the
leer
and
wink
with
which
when
david
came
home
from
kenmuir
at
nights
he
would
ask
the
simple
question
and
was
she
kind
david
eh
eh
made
the
boy
blood
boil
within
him
and
the
more
effective
the
little
man
saw
his
shots
to
be
the
more
persistently
he
plied
them
and
david
retaliated
in
kind
it
was
a
war
of
reprisals
there
was
no
peace
there
were
no
truces
in
which
to
bury
the
dead
before
the
opponents
set
to
slaying
others
and
every
day
brought
the
combatants
nearer
to
that
final
struggle
the
issue
of
which
neither
cared
to
contemplate
there
came
a
saturday
toward
the
end
of
the
spring
long
to
be
remembered
by
more
than
david
in
the
dale
for
that
young
man
the
day
started
sensationally
rising
before
and
going
to
the
window
the
first
thing
he
saw
in
the
misty
dawn
was
the
gaunt
gigantic
figure
of
red
wull
hounding
up
the
hill
from
the
stony
bottom
and
in
an
instant
his
faith
was
shaken
to
its
foundation
the
dog
was
travelling
up
at
a
long
slouching
trot
and
as
he
rapidly
approached
the
house
david
saw
that
his
flanks
were
all
splashed
with
red
mud
his
tongue
out
and
the
foam
dripping
from
his
jaws
as
though
he
had
come
far
and
fast
he
slunk
up
to
the
house
leapt
on
to
the
sill
of
the
unused
some
five
feet
from
the
ground
pushed
with
his
paw
at
the
cranky
old
hatchment
which
was
its
only
covering
and
in
a
second
the
boy
straining
out
of
the
window
the
better
to
see
heard
the
rattle
of
the
boards
as
the
dog
dropped
within
the
house
for
the
moment
excited
as
he
was
david
held
his
peace
even
the
black
killer
took
only
second
place
in
his
thoughts
that
morning
for
this
was
to
be
a
momentous
day
for
him
that
afternoon
james
moore
and
andrew
would
he
knew
be
over
at
and
his
work
finished
for
the
day
he
was
resolved
to
tackle
maggie
and
decide
his
fate
if
she
would
have
him
well
he
would
go
next
morning
and
thank
god
for
it
kneeling
beside
her
in
the
tiny
village
church
if
not
he
would
leave
the
grange
and
all
its
unhappiness
behind
and
straightway
plunge
out
into
the
world
all
through
a
week
of
stern
work
he
had
looked
forward
to
this
therefore
when
as
he
was
breaking
off
at
noon
his
father
turned
to
him
and
said
abruptly
david
ye
to
tak
the
cheviot
lot
to
at
once
he
answered
shortly
yo

wullie
and
me

david
replied
if
they
wait
for
me
they
wait
till

and
with
that
he
left
the
room
i
see
what
is
his
father
called
after
him
she
give
ye
a
tryst
at
kenmuir
oh
ye
randy
david

the
boy
answered
hotly
now
it
happened
that
on
the
previous
day
maggie
had
given
him
a
photograph
of
herself
or
rather
david
had
taken
it
and
maggie
had
demurred
as
he
left
the
room
it
dropped
from
his
pocket
he
failed
to
notice
his
loss
but
directly
he
was
gone
pounced
on
it
he

giggled

he
held
the
picture
down
for
the
great
dog
to
see
then
walked
out
of
the
room
still
sniggering
and
chucking
the
face
insanely
beneath
its
cardboard
chin
outside
the
house
he
collided
against
david
the
boy

missed
his
treasure
and
was
hurrying
back

asked
suspiciously

big
paw
in

very
centre
of

face
forcing
it
into
the
muck
and
tore
a
corner
off
then
he
chewed

scrap

unctious
slobbering
gluttony

it
and
tore
a
fresh
piece
david
dashed

david
turned

down

hill
and
lifted

stricken
face
and
waved
a
hand
at
him
dear
amiable
youth
he
cried
in
broken
voice
and
straightway
set
to
sobbing
again
down
to
the
stony
bottom
david

the
little
man
replied
but
havin
an
eye
to

stock
and
that
when
the

david
laughed
harshly
ay
the
killer
was
oot
i
go
bail
and
yo
may
hear
afore
the
evenin
ma
man
and
with
that
he
turned
away
again
as
he
had
foreseen
david
found
maggie
alone
but
in
the
heat
of
his
indignation
against
his
father
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
original
intent
and
instead
poured
his
latest
troubles
into
the
sympathetic
ear
there
but
one
mon
in
the
world
he
wishes
worse
nor
me
he
was
saying
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
he
was
still
inveighing
against
his
father
and
his
fate
maggie
sat
in
her
father
chair
by
the
fire
knitting
while
he
lounged
on
the
kitchen
table
swinging
his
long
legs
and
who
may
that
be
the
girl
asked
why
moore
to
be
sure
and
th
owd
un
too
he
do
either
o
them
a
mischief
if
he
but
why
david
she
asked
anxiously
i
sure
dad
niver
hurt
him
or
ony
ither
mon
for
the
matter
o
david
nodded
toward
the
dale
cup
which
rested
on
the
mantelpiece
in
silvery
majesty
it
yon
done
it
he
said
and
if
th
owd
un
wins
agin
as

he
will
bless
him
why
look
out
for
and
ma
wullie
that
maggie
shuddered
and
thought
of
the
face
at
the
window
and
ma
wullie
david
continued
i
had
about
as
much
of
them
as
i
can
swaller
it
aye
the
same
and
ma
wullie
and
and
me
as
if

he
made
a
gesture
of
passionate
disgust
the
two
on
fair
madden
me
i
could
strike
the
one
and
throttle
and
he
rattled
his
heels
angrily
together
hush
david
interposed
the
girl

the

murmured
knitting
steadfastly
then

he
cried
triumphant
i
knew
yo
he
approached
close
to
her
chair
his
face
clouded
with
eager
anxiety
but
like
me
just
maggie
he
bent
and
whispered
in
the
little
ear
the
girl
cuddled
over
her
work
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
if
yo
wo
tell
me
yo
can
show
me
he
coaxed
there
other
things
besides
he
stood
before
her
one
hand
on
the
on
either
side
she
sat
thus
caged
between
his
arms
with
drooping
eyes
and
heightened
color
not
so
close
david

she
begged
fidgeting
uneasily
but
the
request
was
unheeded

away
a
wee
she
implored
not
till

he
said
relentless
i

cried
with
laughing
petulance

not
till
yo
showed
a
pause
davie
she
supplicated
and
he
pleaded
she
tilted
her
face
provokingly
but
her
eyes
were
still
down
it
no
manner
o
use
iss
is
he
coaxed
a
lengthy
pause
well
then
she
looked
up
at
last
shy
trustful
happy
and
the
sweet
lips
were
tilted
further
to
meet
his
and
thus
they
were
situated
when
a
low
rapt
voice
broke
in
on
them
lad
convenience
snug
a
treacherous
inclination
oh
wullie
i
wush
you
were
here
it
was
little
he
was
leaning
in
at
the
open
window
leering
at
the
young
couple
his
eyes
puckered
an
evil
expression
on
his
face
the
creetical
moment
and
i
interfere
david
ye
never
forgie
the
boy
jumped
round
with
an
oath
and
maggie
her
face
flaming
started
to
her
feet
the
tone
the
words
the
look
of
the
little
man
at
the
window
were
alike
insufferable
by
thunder
i
teach
yo
to
come
spyin
on
me
roared
david
above
him
on
the
mantelpiece
blazed
the
shepherds
trophy
searching
any
missile
in
his
fury
he
reached
up
a
hand
for
it
ay
gie
it
me
back

the
little
man
cried
holding
out
his
arms
as

david
pleaded
maggie
with
restraining
hand
on
her
arm
by
the
lord

yelled
the
boy
close
by
there
stood
a
pail
of
soapy
water
he
seized
it
swung
it
and
slashed
its
contents
at
the
leering
face
in
the
window
the
little
man
started
back
but
the
dirty
torrent
caught
him
and
soused
him
through
the
bucket
followed
struck
him
full
on
the
chest
and
rolled
him
over
in
the
mud
after
it
with
a
rush
came
david
i
let

he
yelled
i
maggie
whose

was
as

to
him
hampering
him
dinna
david
dinna
she
implored

roared
david
half
through
the
window
at
the
moment
todd
came
floundering
furiously
round
the
corner
closely
followed
by
and
oor
job

he
dead
shouted
seeing
the
prostrate
form
ho
ho
went
the
other
two
they
picked
up
the
draggled
little
man
and
hustled
him
out
of
the
yard
like
a
thief
a
man
on
either
side
and
a
man
behind
as
they
forced
him
through
the
gate
he
struggled
round
by
him
that
made
ye
ye
shall
pay
for
this
david
you
and
yer
but
big
hand
descended
on
his
mouth
and
he
was
borne
away
before
that
last
ill
word
had
flitted
into
being
chapter
xxi
horror
of
darkness
it
was
long
past
dark
that
night
when
staggered
home
all
that
evening
at
the
sylvester
arms
his
imprecations
against
david
had
made
even
the
hardest
shudder
james
moore
owd
bob
and
the
dale
cup
were
for
once
forgotten
as
in
his
passion
he
cursed
his
son
the
dalesmen
gathered
fearfully
away
from
the
little
dripping
madman
for
once
these
men
whom
as
a
rule
no
such
geyser
outbursts
could
quell
were
dumb
before
him
only
now
and
then
shooting
furtive
glances
in
his
direction
as
though
on
the
brink
of
some
daring
enterprise
of
which
he
was
the
objective
but
noticed
nothing
suspected
nothing
when
at
length
he
lurched
into
the
kitchen
of
the
grange
there
was
no
light
and
the
fire
burnt
low
so
dark
was
the
room
that
a
white
riband
of
paper
pinned
on
to
the
table
escaped
his
remark
the
little
man
sat
down
heavily
his
clothes
still
sodden
and
resumed
his
tireless
anathema
i
tholed
mair
fra
him
wullie
than
adam
ever
thocht
to
thole
from
ony
man
and
noo

him
and
his

but
i
gar

adam
i

he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
reaching
up
with
trembling
hands
pulled
down
the
old
blunderbuss
that
hung
above
the
mantelpiece
we
mak
an
end
wullie
so
we
will
aince
and
for
a
and
he
banged
the
weapon
down
upon
the
table
it
lay
right
athwart
that
slip
of
still
condemning
paper
yet
the
little
man
saw
it
not
resuming
his
seat
he
prepared
to
wait
his
hand
sought
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
fingered
tenderly
a
small
stone
bottle
the
fond
companion
of
his
widowhood
he
pulled
it
out
uncorked
it
and
took
a
long
pull
then
placed
it
on
the
table
by
his
side
gradually
the
gray
head
lolled
the
shrivelled
hand
dropped
and
hung
limply
down
the
brushing
the
floor
and
he
dozed
off
into
a
heavy
sleep
while
red
wull
watched
at
his
feet
it
was
not
till
an
hour
later
that
david
returned
home
as
he
approached
the
lightless
house
standing
in
the
darkness
like
a
body
with
the
spirit
fled
he
could
but
contrast
this
dreary
home
of
his
with
the
bright
kitchen
and
cheery
faces
he
had
left
entering
the
house
he
groped
to
the
kitchen
door
and
opened
it
then
struck
a
match
and
stood
in
the
doorway
peering
in
not
home
bai
he
he
muttered
the
tiny
light
above
his
head
wet
inside
as
well
as
oot
by
noo
i
lay
by
gum
but
was
a
lucky
thing
for
him
i
didna
get
ma
hand
on
him
this
evenin
i
could
ha
killed
he
held
the
match
above
his
head
two
yellow
eyes
glowing
in
the
darkness
like
cairngorms
and
a
small
dim
figure
bunched
up
in
a
chair
told
him
his
surmise
was
wrong
many
a
time
had
he
seen
his
father
in
such
case
before
and
now
he
muttered
contemptuously
drunk
the
leetle
swab
sleepin
it
off
i
then
he
saw
his
mistake
the
hand
that
hung
above
the
floor
twitched
and
was
still
again
there
was
a
clammy
silence
a
mouse
emboldened
by
the
quiet
scuttled
across
the
hearth
one
mighty
paw
lightly
moved
a
lightning
tap
and
the
tiny
beast
lay
dead
again
that
hollow
stillness
no
sound
no
movement
only
those
two
unwinking
eyes
fixed
on
him
immovable
at
length
a
small
voice
from
the
fireside
broke
the
quiet
drunk
the
leetle
swab
again
a
clammy
silence
and
a
pause
i
thowt
yo
was
sleepin
said
david
at
length
lamely
ay
so
ye
said
it
aff
i
heard

small
voice
now

little

the
boy
warned

in
choking
voice
and
began
to
trim
the
lamp
with
trembling
fingers
forthwith
addressed
himself
to
red
wull

the
while
in
riotous
leevin
carousin
at
kenmuir
amusin
wi
his
he
broke
off
short
the
lamp
was
lit
and
the
strip
of
paper
pinned
on
to
the
table
naked
and
glaring
caught
his
eye
what
this
he
muttered
and
unloosed
the
nail
that
clamped
it
down
this
is
what
he
read
adam
mackadam

written
in
pencil
and
the
only
signature
was
a
dagger
rudely
lined
in
red
read
the
paper
once
twice
thrice
as
he
slowly
assimilated
its
meaning
the
blood
faded
from
his
face
he
stared
at
it
and
still
stared
with
whitening
face
and
pursed
lips
then
he
stole
a
glance
at
david
broad
back
what
d
ken
o
this
david
he
asked
at
length
in
a
dry
thin
voice
reaching
forward
in
his
chair
o
what
o
this
holding
up
the
slip
and
obleege
me
by
the
truth

david
turned
took
up
the
paper

it
and
laughed
harshly

he
said
still
laughing
and
yet
with
blanching
face
ye

what
it
means
i

there
aiblins

small
even
voice
and
his
eyes
never
moved
off
his
son
face
i
heard
naethin
i
like
the
truth
david
if
ye
can
tell
the
boy
smiled
a
forced
unnatural
smile
looking
from
his
father
to
the
paper
in
his
hand
yo
shall
have
it
but
yo
not
like
it
it
this
tupper
lost
a
sheep
to
the
killer
last
and
what
if
he
did
the
little
man
rose
smoothly
to
his
feet
each
noticed
the
others
face
why
he
lost
it
on
wheer
think
he
drawled
the
words
out
dwelling
almost
lovingly
on
each
where
on
the
red
the
crash
was
coming
inevitable
now
david
knew
it
knew
that
nothing
could
avert
it
and
braced
himself
to
meet
it
the
smile
had
fled
from
his
face
and
his
breath
fluttered
in
his
throat
like
the
wind
before
a
thunderstorm
what
of
it
the
little
man
voice
was
calm
as
a
summer
sea
why
your
wullie
as
i
told
yo
was
on
the
screes
last
go
on
and
this
holding
up
the
paper
tells
you
that
they

kent
this
mony
a
day
that
your
wullie
red
wull
the
terror
go
is
the
black
it
was
spoken
the
frayed
string
was
snapped
at
last
the
little
man
hand
flashed
to
the
bottle
that
stood
before
him
ye
liar
he
shrieked
and
threw
it
with
all
his
strength
at
the
head
david
dodged
and
ducked
and
the
bottle
hurtled
over
his
shoulder
crash
it
whizzed
into
the
lamp
behind
and
broke
on
the
wall
beyond
its
contents
trickling
down
the
wall
to
the
floor
for
a
moment
darkness
then
the
spirits
met
the
lamp
smouldering
wick
and
blazed
into
flame
by
the
sudden
light
david
saw
his
father
on
the
far
side
the
table
pointing
with
crooked
forefinger
by
his
side
red
wull
was
standing
alert
hackles
up
yellow
fangs
bared
eyes
lurid
and
at
his
feet
the
wee
brown
mouse
lay
still
and
lifeless
oot
o
ma
hoose
back
to
kenmuir
back
to
yer
the
unpardonable
word
unmistakable
hovered
for
a
second
on
his
lips
like
some
foul
bubble
and
never
burst
no
mither
this
time
panted
david
racing
round
the
table
wullie
the
terror
leapt
to
the
attack
but
david
overturned
the
table
as
he
ran
the
blunderbuss
crashing
to
the
floor
it
fell
opposing
a
momentary
barrier
in
the
dog
path
stan
off
ye
screeched
the
little
man
seizing
a
chair
in
both
hands
stan
off
or
i
brain
ye
but
david
was
on
him
wullie
wullie
to
me
again
the
terror
came
with
a
roar
like
the
sea
but
david
with
a
mighty
kick
catching
him
full
on
the
jaw
repelled
the
attack
then
he
gripped
his
father
round
the
waist
and
lifted
him
from
the
ground
the
little
man
struggling
in
those
iron
arms
screamed
cursed
and
battered
at
the
face
above
him
kicking
and
biting
in
his
frenzy
the
killer
wad
ye
ken
wha
the
killer
go
and
ask
at
kenmuir
ask
yer
david
swayed
slightly
crushing
the
body
in
his
arms
till
it
seemed
every
rib
must
break
then
hurled
it
from
him
with
all
the
might
of
passion
the
little
man
fell
with
a
crash
and
a
groan
the
blaze
in
the
corner
flared
flickered
and
died
there
was
darkness
and
silence
of
the
dead
david
stood
against
the
wall
panting
every
nerve
tightstrung
as
the
hawser
of
a
straining
ship
in
the
corner
lay
the
body
of
his
father
limp
and
still
and
in
the
room
one
other
living
thing
was
moving
he
clung
close
to
the
wall
pressing
it
with
wet
hands
the
horror
of
it
all
the
darkness
the
man
in
the
corner
that
moving
something
petrified
him
feyther
he
whispered
there
was
no
reply
a
chair
creaked
at
an
invisible
touch
something
was
creeping
stealing
crawling
closer
david
was
afraid
feyther
he
whispered
in
hoarse
agony
are
yo
hurt
the
words
were
stifled
in
his
throat
a
chair
overturned
with
a
crash
a
great
body
struck
him
on
the
chest
a
hot
pestilent
breath
volleyed
in
his
face
and
wolfish
teeth
were
reaching
for
his
throat
come
on
killer
he
screamed
the
horror
of
suspense
was
past
it
had
come
and
with
it
he
was
himself
again
back
back
back
along
the
wall
he
was
borne
his
hands
entwined
themselves
around
a
hairy
throat
he
forced
the
great
head
with
its
horrid
lightsome
eyes
from
him
he
braced
himself
for
the
effort
lifted
the
huge
body
at
his
breast
and
heaved
it
from
him
it
struck
the
wall
and
fell
with
a
soft
thud
as
he
recoiled
a
hand
clutched
his
ankle
and
sought
to
trip
him
david
kicked
back
and
down
with
all
his
strength
there
was
one
awful
groan
and
he
staggered
against
the
door
and
out
there
he
paused
leaning
against
the
wall
to
breathe
he
struck
a
match
and
lifted
his
foot
to
see
where
the
hand
had
clutched
him
god
there
was
blood
on
his
heel
then
a
great
fear
laid
hold
on
him
a
cry
was
suffocated
in
his
breast
by
the
panting
of
his
heart
he
crept
back
to
the
kitchen
door
and
listened
not

sound
fearfully
he
opened
it
a
crack
silence
of
the
tomb
he
banged
it
to
it
opened
behind
him
and
the
fact
lent
wings
to
his
feet
he
turned
and
plunged
out
into
the
night
and
ran
through
the
blackness
for
his
life

a
great
owl

a
man
and
a
maid
in
the
village
even
the
black
killer
and
the
murder
on
the
screes
were
forgotten
in
this
new
sensation
the
mystery
in
which
the
affair
was
wrapped
and
the
ignorance
as
to
all
its
details
served
to
whet
the
general
interest
there
had
been
a
fight
and
the
terror
had
been
mauled
and
david
had
disappeared
those
were
the
facts
but
what
was
the
origin
of
the
affray
no
one
could
say
one
or
two
of
the
dalesmen
had
indeed
a
shrewd
suspicion
tupper
looked
guilty

i
knoo

be
while
as
for
long
kirby
he
vanished
entirely
not
to
reappear
till
three
months
had
sped
injured
as
he
had
been
was
yet
sufficiently
recovered
to
appear
in
the
sylvester
arms
on
the
saturday
following
the
battle
he
entered
the
silently
with
never
a
word
to
a
soul
one
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
his
head
bandaged
he
eyed
every
man
present
critically
and
all
except
tammas
who
was
brazen
and
jim
mason
who
was
innocent
fidgeted
beneath
the
stare
maybe
it
was
well
for
long
kirby
he
was
not
there
onythin
the

asked
jem
at
length
rather
lamely
in
view
of
the
plain
evidences
of

na
naethin
oot
o

the
little
man
replied
giggling
only
david
set
on
me
and
me
sleepin
and
with
a
shrug
here
i
am
he
sat
down
wagging
his
bandaged
head
and
grinning
ye

sae
playfu

he
wangs
ye
the
head
wi
a

kicks
ye
in
the
jaw
stamps
on

wame
and
all
as
merry
as
and
nothing
further
could
they
get
from
him
except
that
if
david
reappeared
it
was
his
firm
resolve
to
hand
him
over
to
the
police
for
attempted
parricide
assault
on
an
auld
man
by
his
son
look
well
in
the
argus
he
he
they
couldna
let
him
aff
under
two
years
i
version
of
the
affair
was
received
with
quiet
incredulity
the
general
verdict
was
that
he
had
brought
his
punishment
entirely
on
his
own
head
tammas
indeed
who
was
always
rude
when
he
was
not
witty
and
in
fact
the
difference
between
the
two
things
is
only
one
of
degree
told
him
straight
it
served
yo
well
reet
an
i
wish
he
made
an
end
to
he
did
his
best
puir
lad
reminded
him
gently
we
had
enough
o
yo
continued
the
uncompromising
old
man
fair
grieved
he
didna
slice
yer
throat
while
he
was
at
at
that
raised
his
eyebrows
stared
and
then
broke
into
a
low
whistle
that
it
is
it
he
muttered
as
though
a
new
light
was
dawning
on
him
ah
noo
i
the
days
passed
on
there
was
still
no
news
of
the
missing
one
and
maggie
face
became
pitifully
white
and
haggard
of
course
she
did
not
believe
that
david
had
attempted
to
murder
his
father
desperately
tried
as
she
knew
he
had
been
still
it
was
a
terrible
thought
to
her
that
he
might
at
any
moment
be
arrested
and
her
girlish
imagination
was
perpetually
conjuring
up
horrid
pictures
of
a
trial
conviction
and
the
things
that
followed
then
started
a
wild
theory
that
the
little
man
had
murdered
his
son
and
thrown
the
mangled
body
down
the
dry
well
at
the
grange
the
story
was
of
course
preposterous
and
coming
from
such
a
source
might
well
have
been
discarded
with
the
ridicule
it
deserved
yet
it
served
to
set
the
cap
on
the
girl
fears
and
she
resolved
at
whatever
cost
to
visit
the
grange
beard
and
discover
whether
he
could
not
or
would
not
allay
her
gnawing
apprehension
her
intent
she
concealed
from
her
father
knowing
well
that
were
she
to
reveal
it
to
him
he
would
gently
but
firmly
forbid
the
attempt
and
on
an
afternoon
some
fortnight
after
david
disappearance
choosing
her
opportunity
she
picked
up
a
shawl
threw
it
over
her
head
and
fled
with
palpitating
heart
out
of
the
farm
and
down
the
slope
to
the
wastrel
the
little
rattled
as
she
tripped
across
it
and
she
fled
faster
lest
any
one
should
have
heard
and
come
to
look
and
indeed
at
the
moment
it
rattled
again
behind
her
and
she
started
guiltily
round
it
proved
however
to
be
only
owd
bob
sweeping
after
and
she
was
glad
comin
wi
me
lad
she
asked
as
the
old
dog
cantered
up
thankful
to
have
that
gray
protector
with
her
round
langholm
now
fled
the
two
conspirators
over
the
lower
slopes
of
the
pike
until
at
length
they
reached
the
stony
bottom
down
the
bank
of
the
ravine
the
girl
slid
picked
her
way
from
stone
to
stone
across
the
streamlet
tinkling
in
that
rocky
bed
and
scrambled
up
the
opposite
bank
at
the
top
she
halted
and
looked
back
the
smoke
from
kenmuir
was
winding
slowly
up
against
the
sky
to
her
right
the
low
gray
cottages
of
the
village
cuddled
in
the
bosom
of
the
dale
far
away
over
the
marches
towered
the
gaunt
scaur
before
her
rolled
the
swelling
slopes
of
the
muir
pike
while
behind
she
glanced
timidly
over
her
shoulder
was
the
hill
at
the
top
of
which
squatted
the
grange
lifeless
cold
scowling
her
heart
failed
her
in
her
whole
life
she
had
never
spoken
to
yet
she
knew
him
well
enough
from
all
david
accounts
ay
and
hated
him
for
david
sake
she
hated
him
and
feared
him
too
feared
him
mortally
this
terrible
little
man
and
with
a
shudder
she
recalled
the
dim
face
at
the
window
and
thought
of
his
notorious
hatred
of
her
father
but
even
could
hardly
harm
a
girl
coming
to
seek
her
lover
besides
was
not
owd
bob
with
her
and
turning
she
saw
the
old
dog
standing
a
little
way
up
the
hill
looking
back
at
her
as
though
he
wondered
why
she
waited
am
i
not
enough
the
faithful
gray
eyes
seemed
to
say
lad
i
fear
was
her
answer
to
the
unspoken
question
yet
that
look
determined
her
she
clenched
her
little
teeth
drew
the
shawl
about
her
and
set
off
running
up
the
hill
soon
the
run
dwindled
to
a
walk
the
walk
to
a
crawl
and
the
crawl
to
a
halt
her
breath
was
coming
painfully
and
her
heart
pattered
against
her
side
like
the
beatings
of
an
imprisoned
bird
again
her
gray
guardian
looked
up
encouraging
her
forward
keep
close
lad
she
whispered
starting
forward
afresh
and
the
old
dog
ranged
up
beside
her
shoving
into
her
skirt
as
though
to
let
her
feel
his
presence
so
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
house
stood
before
them
grim
unfriendly
the
girl
face
was
now
quite
white
yet
set
the
resemblance
to
her
father
was
plain
to
see
with
lips
compressed
and
breath
she
crossed
the
threshold
treading
softly
as
though
in
a
house
of
the
dead
there
she
paused
and
lifted
a
warning
finger
at
her
companion
bidding
him
halt
without
then
she
turned
to
the
door
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
and
tapped
she
listened
her
head
buried
in
the
shawl
close
to
the
wood
panelling
there
was
no
answer
she
could
only
hear
the
drumming
of
her
heart
she
knocked
again
from
within
came
the
scraping
of
a
chair
cautiously
shoved
back
followed
by
a
cavernous
growl
her
heart
stood
still
but
she
turned
the
handle
and
entered
leaving
a
crack
open
behind
on
the
far
side
the
room
a
little
man
was
sitting
his
head
was
swathed
in
dirty
bandages
and
a
bottle
was
on
the
table
beside
him
he
was
leaning
forward
his
face
was
gray
and
there
was
a
stare
of
naked
horror
in
his
eyes
one
hand
grasped
the
great
dog
who
stood
at
his
side
with
yellow
teeth
glinting
and
muzzle
hideously
wrinkled
with
the
other
he
pointed
a
palsied
finger
at
her
ma
god
wha
are
ye
he
cried
hoarsely
the
girl
stood
hard
against
the
door
her
fingers
still
on
the
handle
trembling
like
an
aspen
at
the
sight
of
that
uncannie
pair
that
look
in
the
little
man
eyes
petrified
her
the
swollen
pupils
lashless
lids
yawning
wide
the
broken
range
of
teeth
in
that
gaping
mouth
froze
her
very
soul
rumors
of
the
man
insanity
tided
back
on
her
memory
i
i
the
words
came
in
trembling
gasps
at
the
first
utterance
however
the
little
man
hand
dropped
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
no
woman
had
crossed
that
threshold
since
his
wife
died
and
for
a
moment
when
first
the
girl
had
entered
aroused
from
dreaming
of
the
long
ago
he
had
thought
this
figure
with
the
pale
face
and
peeping
hair
no
earthly
visitor
the
spirit
rather
of
one
he
had
loved
long
since
and
lost
come
to
reproach
him
with
a
broken
troth
speak
up
i
canna
hear
he
said
in
tones
mild
compared
with
those
last
wild
words
i
i
maggie
moore
the
girl
quavered
moore
maggie
moore
d
say
he
cried
half
rising
from
his
chair
a
flush
of
color
sweeping
across
his
face
the
dochter
o
james
moore
he
paused
for
an
answer
glowering
at
her
and
she
shrank
trembling
against
the
door
the
little
man
leant
back
in
his
chair
gradually
a
grim
smile
crept
across
his
countenance
weel
maggie
moore
he
said
halfamused
ony
gate
ye
a
good
plucked
and
his
wizened
countenance
looked
at
her
almost
kindly
from
beneath
its
dirty
crown
of
bandages
at
that
the
girl
courage
returned
with
a
rush
after
all
this
little
man
was
not
so
very
terrible
perhaps
he
would
be
kind
and
in
the
relief
of
the
moment
the
blood
swept
back
into
her
face
there
was
not
to
be
peace
yet
however
the
blush
was
still
hot
upon
her
cheeks
when
she
caught
the
patter
of
soft
steps
in
the
passage
without
a
dark
muzzle
flecked
with
gray
pushed
in
at
the
crack
of
the
door
two
anxious
gray
eyes
followed
before
she
could
wave
him
back
red
wull
had
marked
the
intruder
with
a
roar
he
tore
himself
from
his
master
restraining
hand
and
dashed
across
the
room
back
bob
screamed
maggie
and
the
dark
head
withdrew
the
door
slammed
with
a
crash
as
the
great
dog
flung
himself
against
it
and
maggie
was
hurled
breathless
and
into
a
corner
was
on
his
feet
pointing
with
a
shrivelled
finger
his
face
diabolical
did
you
bring
him
did
you
bring
to
ma
door
maggie
huddled
in
the
corner
in
a
palsy
of
trepidation
her
eyes
gleamed
big
and
black
in
the
white
face
peering
from
the
shawl
red
wull
was
now
beside
her
snarling
horribly
with
nose
to
the
bottom
of
the
door
and
busy
paws
he
was
trying
to
get
out
while
on
the
other

he
cam
with
hissing
emphasis
straight
from

and
stared
at

intently
and
she
was
still
dumb

she
did
not
and
he
saw
it
and
was
satisfied
what
he
had
been
saying
she
neither
knew
nor
cared
she
only
remembered
the
object
of
her
mission
she
only
saw
before
her
the
father
of
the
man
she
loved
and
a
wave
of
emotion
surged
up
in
her
breast
she
advanced
timidly
toward
him
holding
out
her
hands
eh
she
pleaded
i
come
to
ask
ye
after
the
shawl
had
slipped
from
her
head
and
lay
loose
upon
her
shoulders
and
she
stood
before
him
with
her
sad
face
her
pretty
hair
all
tossed
and
her
eyes
big
with
unshed
tears
a
touching
suppliant
will
ye

not

the

simply
weel
the
other
remarked
as
i
said
afore
ye
a
good
plucked
then
in
a
tone
in
which
despite
the
cynicism
a
certain
indefinable
sadness
was
blended
gin

mak
you
as
good
husband
as
he
mad
son
to

ye

made
a
maist
remairkable
match

maggie
fired
in
a
moment
a
good
feyther

a
good
son
she
answered
almost
pertly
and
then
with
infinite
tenderness
and
i
prayin
a
good
wife
make
a
good
he
smiled
scoffingly
i
feared
that
no
help
ye
much
he
said
but
the
girl
never
heeded
this
last
sneer
so
set
was
she
on
her
purpose
she
had
heard
of
the
one
tender
place
in
the
heart
of
this
little
man
with
the
tired
face
and
mocking
tongue
and
she
resolved
to
attain
her
end
by
appealing
to
it
yo
loved
a
lass
aince
she
said
hoo
would
ha
felt
had
she
gone
away
and
left
yo
yo
ha
bin
mad
yo
know
would
and
i
love
the
lad
yer
wife
she
was
kneeling
at
his
feet
now
with
both
hands
on
his
knees
looking
up
at
him
her
sad
face
and
quivering
lips
pleaded
for
her
more
eloquently
than
any
words
the
little
man
was
visibly
touched
ay
ay
lass
that
enough
he
said
trying
to
avoid
those
big
beseeching
eyes
which
would
not
be
avoided
will
ye
no
tell
me
she
pleaded
i
canna
tell
ye
lass
for
why
i
dinna
ken
he
answered
querulously
in
truth
he
was
moved
to
the
heart
by
her
misery
the
girl
last
hopes
were
dashed
she
had
played
her
last
card
and
failed
she
had
clung
with
the
fervor
of
despair
to
this
last
resource
and
now
it
was
torn
from
her
she
had
hoped
and
now
there
was
no
hope
in
the
anguish
of
her
disappointment
she
remembered
that
this
was
the
man
who
by
his
persistent
cruelty
had
driven
her
love
into
exile
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
back
nor
ken
nor
care
she
cried
bitterly
at
the
words
all
the
softness
fled
from
the
little
man

he
said
looking
up
at
her
with
an
assumed
ingenuousness
which
had
she
known
him
better
would
have
warned
her
to
beware

lad

vairy
first
to
let

he
he
he
chuckled
at
his
wit
and
rubbed
his
knees
regardless
of
the
contempt
blazing
in
the
girl
face
i
canna
tell
ye
where
he
is
now
but
ye

to

when
i
saw

he
turned
his
chair
the
better
to
address
her
twas
like
so
i
was
sittin
in
this
vairy
chair
it
was
asleep
when
he
crep
up
behind
an
lep
on
ma
back
i
knew
naethin
till
i
found
masel
on
the
floor
an
him
kneelin
on
me
i
saw
by
the
look
on
him
he
was
set
on
finishin
me
so
i
said
the
girl
waved
her
hand
at
him
superbly
disdainful
yo
ken
yo
lyin
ivery
word
she
cried
the
little
man
hitched
his
trousers
crossed
his
legs
and
yawned
an
honest
lee
for
an
honest
purpose
is
a
matter
ony
man
may
be
proud
of
as
you
ken
by
the
time
you
my
years
ma
the
girl
slowly
crossed
the
room
at
the
door
she
turned
then
ye
no
tell
me
wheer
he
is
she
asked
with
a
trill
in
her
voice
on
ma
word
lass
i
dinna
ken
he
cried
half
passionately
on
your
word
she
said
with
a
quiet
scorn
in
her
voice
that
might
have
stung
iscariot
the
little
man
spun
round
in
his
chair
an
angry
red
dyeing
his
cheeks
in
another
moment
he
was
suave
and
smiling
again
i
canna
tell
ye
where
he
is
noo
he
said
unctuously
but
aiblins
i
could
let
ye
know
where
he
gaein
can
yo
will
yo
cried
the
simple
girl
all
unsuspecting
in
a
moment
she
was
across
the
room
and
at
his
knees
closer
and
i
the
little
ear
peeping
from
its
nest
of
brown
was
tremblingly
approached
to
his
lips
the
little
man
lent
forward
and
whispered
one
short
sharp
word
then
sat
back
grinning
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
disclosure
he
had
his
revenge
an
unworthy
revenge
on
such
a
victim
and
watching
the
girl
face
the
cruel
disappointment
merging
in
the
heat
of
her
indignation
he
had
yet
enough
nobility
to
regret
his
triumph
she
sprang
from
him
as
though
he
were
unclean
an
yo
his
father
she
cried
in
burning
tones
she
crossed
the
room
and
at
the
door
paused
her
face
was
white
again
and
she
was
quite
composed
if
david
did
strike
you
you
drove
him
to
it
she
said
speaking
in
calm
gentle
accents
yo
know
none
so
well
whether
yo
bin
a
good
feyther
to
him
and
him
no
mither
poor
laddie
whether
yo
bin
to
him
what
she
ha
had
yo
be

an
if

a
wee
aggravatin
at
times
had
he
no
reason

a
heavy
cross
to
bear
had
david
and
yo
know
best
if
yo
helped
to
ease
it
for
the
little
man
pointed
to
the
door
but
the
girl
paid
no
heed
think
when
yo
were
cruel
to
him
jeerin
and
fleerin
he
never
felt
it
because
he
was
too
proud
to
show
ye
he
a
big
saft
heart
had
david
beneath
the
varnish
mony
the
time
when
mither
was
alive
seen
him
throw
himsel
into
her
arms
sobbin
and
cry
if
i
had
but
mither
was
different
when
mither
was
alive
he
was
kinder
to
me
then
an
noo
i
no
one
i
alone
an
he
sob
and
sob
in
arms
and
she
weepin
hersel
would
comfort
him
while
he
wee
laddie
would
no
be
comforted
cryin
none
to
care
for
me
noo
i
alone
mither
left
me
and
eh
i
prayin
to
be
wi
her
the
clear
girlish
voice
shook
sitting
with
face
averted
waved
to
her
mutely
ordering
her
to
be
gone
but
she
held
on
gentle
sorrowful
relentless
an
what
yo
say
to
his
mither
when
yo
meet
her
as
yo
must
soon
noo
and
she
asks
yo
what

and
she

this
what
i
deserved
fra
yo
the
gentle
implacable
voice
ceased
the
girl
turned
and
slipped
softly
out
of
the
room
and
was
left
alone
to
his
thoughts
and
his
dead
wife
memory
mither
and
father
baith
mither
and
father
baith
rang
remorselessly
in
his
ears
chapter
xxiii
th
owd
un
the
black
killer
still
cursed
the
land
sometimes
there
would
be
a
cessation
in
the
crimes
then
a
shepherd
going
his
rounds
would
notice
his
sheep
herding
together
packing
in
unaccustomed
squares
a
raven
gorged
to
the
crop
would
rise
before
him
and
flap
wearily
away
and
he
would
come
upon
the
murderer
latest
victim
the
dalesmen
were
in
despair
so
utterly
futile
had
their
efforts
been
there
was
no
proof
no
hope
no
apparent
probability
that
the
end
was
near
as
for
the
tailless
tyke
the
only
piece
of
evidence
against
him
had
flown
with
david
who
as
it
chanced
had
divulged
what
he
had
seen
to
no
man
the
pound
reward
offered
had
brought
no
issue
the
police
had
done
nothing
the
special
commissioner
had
been
equally
successful
after
the
affair
in
the
scoop
the
killer
never
ran
a
risk
yet
never
missed
a
chance
then
as
a
last
resource
jim
mason
made
his
attempt
he
took
a
holiday
from
his
duties
and
disappeared
into
the
wilderness
three
days
and
three
nights
no
man
saw
him
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
he
reappeared
haggard
unkempt
a
furtive
look
haunting
his
eyes
sullen
for
once
irritable
who
had
never
been
irritable
before
to
confess
his
failure
further
he
answered
with
unaccustomed
fierceness
i
seed
nowt
i
tell
ye
the
liar
as
said
i
did
but
that
night
his
missus
heard
him
in
his
sleep
conning
over
something
to
himself
in
slow
fearful
whisper
two
on
one
ahint
the
first
big
at
which
point
mason
smote
him
a
smashing
blow
in
the
ribs
and
he
woke
in
a
sweat
crying
terribly
who
said
i
seed
the
days
were
slipping
away
the
summer
was
hot
upon
the
land
and
with
it
the
black
killer
was
forgotten
david
was
forgotten
everything
sank
into
oblivion
before
the
interest
of
the
coming
dale
trials
the
battle
for
the
shepherds
trophy
was
looming
close
soon
everything
that
hung
upon
the
issue
of
that
struggle
would
be
decided
finally
for
ever
the
justice
of
th
owd
un
claim
to
his
proud
title
would
be
settled
if
he
won
he
won
outright
a
thing
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
the
cup
if
he
won
the
place
of
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
as
first
in
his
profession
was
assured
for
all
time
above
all
it
was
the
last
event
in
the
six
years
struggle
red
and
gray
it
was
the
last
time
those
two
great
rivals
would
meet
in
battle
the
supremacy
of
one
would
be
decided
once
and
for
all
for
win
or
lose
it
was
the
last
public
appearance
of
the
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
and
as
every
hour
brought
the
great
day
nearer
nothing
else
was
talked
of
in
the
the
heat
of
the
dalesmen
enthusiasm
was
only
intensified
by
the
fever
of
their
apprehension
many
a
man
would
lose
more
than
he
cared
to
contemplate
were
th
owd
un
beat
but
he
not
be
nay
owd
indeed
he
was
two
years
older
than
his
great
rival
there
were
a
hundred
risks
a
hundred
chances
still
what
the
odds
agin
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
i
takin
who
lay
agin
th
owd
un
and
with
the
air
saturated
with
this
perpetual
talk
of
the
old
dog
these
everlasting
references
to
his
certain
victory
his
ears
drumming
with
the
often
boast
that
the
gray
dog
was
the
best
in
the
north
became
the
silent
man
of
six
months
since
morose
brooding
suspicious
muttering
of
conspiracy
plotting
revenge
the
scenes
at
the
sylvester
arms
were
replicas
of
those
of
previous
years
usually
the
little
man
sat
isolated
in
a
far
corner
silent
and
glowering
with
red
wull
at
his
feet
now
and
then
he
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
insane
giggling
slapping
his
thigh
and
muttering
ay
it
likely
they
beat
us
wullie
yet
aiblins
there
a
wee
somethin
a
somethin
we
ken
and
they
dinna
wullie
eh
wullie
he
he
and
sometimes
he
would
leap
to
his
feet
and
address
his
audience
appealing
to
them
passionately
satirically
tearfully
as
the
mood
might
be
on
him
and
his
theme
was
always
the
same
james
moore
owd
bob
the
cup
and
the
plots
agin
him
and
his
wullie
and
always
he
concluded
with
that
hint
of
the
surprise
to
come
meantime
there
was
no
news
of
david
he
had
gone
as
utterly
as
a
ship
foundered
in
some
said
he
some
that
he
gone
to
sea
and
so
he
corroborated
floatin
with
no
gleam
of
consolation
maggie
misery
was
such
as
to
rouse
compassion
in
all
hearts
she
went
no
longer
blithely
singing
about
her
work
and
all
the
springiness
had
fled
from
her
gait
the
people
of
kenmuir
vied
with
one
another
in
their
attempts
to
console
their
young
mistress
maggie
was
not
the
only
one
in
whose
life
david
absence
had
created
a
void
last
as
he
would
have
been
to
own
it
felt
acutely
the
boy
loss
it
may
have
been
he
missed
the
butt
it
may
have
been
a
nobler
feeling
alone
with
red
wull
too
late
he
felt
his
loneliness
sometimes
sitting
in
the
kitchen
by
himself
thinking
of
the
past
he
experienced
sharp
pangs
of
remorse
and
this
was
all
the
more
the
case
after
maggie
visit
subsequent
to
that
day
the
little
man
to
do
him
justice
was
never
known
to
hint
by
word
or
look
an
ill
thing
of
his
enemy
daughter
once
indeed
when
melia
ross
was
drawing
on
a
dirty
imagination
with
maggie
for
subject
shut
her
up
with
ye
a
maist
amazin
big
liar
melia
yet
though
for
the
daughter
he
had
now
no
evil
thought
his
hatred
for
the
father
had
never
been
so
uncompromising
he
grew
reckless
in
his
assertions
his
life
was
one
long
threat
against
james
moore
now
he
openly
stated
his
conviction
that
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
fight
james
moore
with
object
easily
discernible
had
egged
david
on
to
murder
him
then
why
do
yo
go
and
tell
him
so
yo
muckle
liar
roared
tammas
at
last
enraged
to
madness
i
will
said
and
he
did
it
was
on
the
day
preceding
the
great
summer
sheep
fair
at
that
he
fulfilled
his
vow
that
is
always
a
big
at
kenmuir
and
on
this
occasion
james
moore
and
owd
bob
had
been
up
and
working
on
the
pike
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
throughout
the
straggling
lands
of
kenmuir
the
master
went
with
his
untiring
adjutant
rounding
up
cutting
out
drafting
it
was
already
noon
when
the
flock
started
from
the
yard
on
the
gate
by
the
stile
as
the
party
came
up
sat
i
a
word
to
say
to
you
james
moore
he
announced
as
the
master
approached
say
it
then
and
quick
i
no
time
to
stand
gossipin
here
if
have
said
the
master
strained
forward
till
he
nearly
toppled
off
the
gate
queer
thing
james
moore
you
should
be
the
only
one
to
escape
this
yo
forget
yoursel
ay
there
me
acquiesced
the
little
man
but
you
hoo
for
luck
james
moore
swung
round
and
pointed
proudly
at
the
gray
dog
now
patrolling
round
the
flock
there
my
luck
he
said
laughed
unpleasantly
so
i
thought
he
said
so
i
thought
and
i
ye
thinkin
that
yer
luck
nodding
at
the
gray
dog
will
win
you
the
cup
for
certain
a
month
i
hope
so
said
the
master
strange
if
he
should
not
after
all
mused
the
little
man
james
moore
eyed
him
suspiciously
what
mean
he
asked
sternly
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
mony
a
slip
cup
and
lip
that
a
i
was
thinkin
some
mischance
might
come
to
the
master
eyes
flashed
dangerously
he
recalled
the
many
rumors
he
had
heard
and
the
attempt
on
the
old
dog
early
in
the
year
i
canna
think
ony
one
would
be
coward
enough
to
murder
him
he
said
drawing
himself
up
leant
forward
there
was
a
nasty
glitter
in
his
eye
and
his
face
was
all
ye
no
think
ony
one
be
cooard
enough
to
set
the
son
to
murder
the
father
yet
some
one
did
set
the
lad
on
to
me
he
failed
at
me
and
next
i
suppose
he
try
at
wullie
there
was
a
flush
on
the
sallow
face
and
a
vindictive
ring
in
the
thin
voice
one
way
or
fair
or
foul
wullie
or
me
ain
or
baith
has
got
to
go
afore
cup
day
eh
james
moore
eh
the
master
put
his
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
that
do
he
said
i
stop
to
hear
no
more
else
i
might
get
angry
wi
yo
noo
git
off
this
gate
yo
trespassin
as
is
he
shook
the
gate
tumbled
off
and
went
sprawling
into
the
sheep
clustered
below
picking
himself
up
he
dashed
on
through
the
flock
waving
his
arms
kicking
fantastically
and
scattering
confusion
everywhere
just
wait
till
i
thro
wi
will
yo
shouted
the
master
seeing
the
danger
it
was
a
request
which
according
to
the
etiquette
of
shepherding
one
man
was
bound
to
grant
another
but
rushed
on
regardless
dancing
and
gesticulating
save
for
the
lightning
vigilance
of
owd
bob
the
flock
must
have
broken
i
think
yo
might
ha
waited
remonstrated
the
master
as
the
little
man
burst
his
way
through
noo
i
forgot
somethin
the
other
cried
and
back
he
started
as
he
had
gone
it
was
more
than
human
nature
could
tolerate
bob
keep
him
off
a
flash
of
teeth
a
blaze
of
gray
eyes
and
the
old
dog
had
leapt
forward
to
oppose
the
little
man
advance
shift
oot
o
ma
light
cried
he
striving
to
dash
past
hold
him
lad
and
hold
him
the
old
dog
did
while
his
master
opened
the
gate
and
put
the
flock
through
the
opponents
dodging
in
front
of
one
another
like
opposing
at
the
rugby
game
oot
o
ma
path
or
i
strike
shouted
the
little
man
in
a
fury
as
the
last
sheep
passed
through
the
gate
i
not
warned
the
master
but
i
will
yelled
and
darting
forward
as
the
gate
swung
to
struck
furiously
at
his
opponent
he
missed
and
the
gray
dog
charged
at
him
like
a
hi
james
moore
but
over
he
went
like
a
toppled
wheelbarrow
while
the
old
dog
turned
again
raced
at
the
gate
took
it
magnificently
in
his
stride
and
galloped
up
the
lane
after
his
master
at
yell
james
moore
had
turned
served
yo
properly
he
called
back
he
larn
ye
yet
it
not
wise
to
tamper
wi
a
gray
dog
or
his
sheep
not
the
first
time
he
downed
ye
i
thinkin
the
little
man
raised
himself
painfully
to
his
elbow
and
crawled
toward
the
gate
the
master
up
the
lane
could
hear
him
cursing
as
he
dragged
himself
another
moment
and
a
head
was
poked
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
a
devilish
little
face
looked
after
him
downed
me
by
he
did
the
little
man
cried
passionately
i
owed
ye

a
shot
in

three
short
weeks
before

one
afternoon

mason
brought
a
letter
to
kenmuir
james
moore
opened
it
as
the
postman

stood
in
the
door
it
was
from
long
kirby
still
in
retirement
begging
him
for
sake
to
keep
owd
bob
safe
within
doors
at
nights
at
all
events
till
after
the
great
event
was
over
for
kirby
knew
as
did
every
dalesman
that
the
old
dog
slept
in
the
porch
between
the
two
doors
of
the
house
of
which
the
outer
was
only
loosely
closed
by
a
chain
so
that
the
guardian
might
slip
in
and
out
and
go
his
rounds
at
any
moment
of
the
night
this
was
how
the
smith
concluded
his
note

the
master
read
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
postman
who
perused
it
carefully
i
tell
yo
what
said
jim
at
length
speaking
with
an
earnestness
that
made
the
other
stare
i
wish

asks

owd

shook
his
head
and
laughed
tearing
the
letter
to
pieces
nay
said
he
or
no

or
no

owd

same
as
he

since
a
puppy
why
jim
the
first
night
i
shut
him
up
that
night
the
killer
comes
i
the
postman
turned
wearily
away
and
the
master
stood
looking
after
him
wondering
what
had
come
of
late
to
his
former
cheery
friend
those
two
were
not
the
only
warnings
james
moore
received
during
the
weeks
immediately
preceding
the
trials
the
danger
signal
was
perpetually
flaunted
beneath
his
nose
twice
did
watch
the
black
chained
in
the
hurl
a
brazen
challenge
on
the
night
air
twice
did
the
master
with
lantern
and
owd
bob
sally
forth
and
search
every
hole
and
corner
on
the
premises
to
find
nothing
one
of
the
gave
notice
avowing
that
the
farm
was
haunted
that
on
several
occasions
in
the
early
morning
she
had
seen
a
bogie
flitting
down
the
slope
to
the
wastrel
a
sure
portent
declared
of
an
approaching
death
in
the
house
while
once
a
shearer
coming
up
from
the
village
reported
having
seen
in
the
twilight
of
dawn
a
little
ghostly
figure
haggard
and
startled
stealing
silently
from
tree
to
tree
in
the
by
the
lane
the
master
however
irritated
by
these
constant
alarms
dismissed
the
story
summarily
one
thing
i
sartin
o
said
he
there
not
a
critter
moves
on
kenmuir
at
nights
but
th
owd
un
knows
yet
even
as
he
said
it
a
little
man
draggled
smeared
with
dew
and
dust
was
limping
in
at
the
door
of
a
house
barely
a
mile
away
nae
luck
wullie
curse
it
he
cried
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
and
addressing
some
one
who
was
not
there
nae
luck
an
yet
sure
as
i
am
that
there
a
god
in
had
become
an
old
man
of
late
but
little
more
than
fifty
yet
he
looked
to
have
reached
man
allotted
years
his
sparse
hair
was
quite
white
his
body
shrunk
and
bowed
and
his
thin
hand
shook
like
an
aspen
as
it
groped
to
the
familiar
bottle
in
another
matter
too
he
was
altogether
changed
formerly
whatever
his
faults
there
had
been
no
man
in
the
at
all
hours
in
all
weathers
you
might
have
seen
him
with
his
gigantic
attendant
going
his
rounds
now
all
that
was
different
he
never
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
and
with
none
to
help
him
the
land
was
left
wholly
untended
so
that
men
said
that
of
a
surety
there
would
be
a
farm
to
let
on
the
march
mere
estate
come
michaelmas
instead
of
working
the
little
man
sat
all
day
in
the
kitchen
at
home
brooding
over
his
wrongs
and
brewing
vengeance
even
the
sylvester
arms
knew
him
no
more
for
he
stayed
where
he
was
with
his
dog
and
his
bottle
only
when
the
shroud
of
night
had
come
down
to
cover
him
he
slipped
out
and
away
on
some
errand
on
which
not
even
red
wull
accompanied
him
so
the
time
glided
on
till
the
sunday
before
the
trials
came
round
all
that
day
sat
in
his
kitchen
drinking
muttering
hatching
revenge
curse
it
wullie
curse
it
the
time
slippin
slippin
slippin
thursday
next
but
three
days
mair
and
i
haena
the
proof
i
haena
the
proof
and
he
rocked
to
and
fro
biting
his
nails
in
the
agony
of
his
impotence
all
day
long
he
never
moved
long
after
sunset
he
sat
on
long
after
dark
had
eliminated
the
features
of
the
room
they
all
agin
us
wullie
it
you
and
i
alane
lad
to
be
beat
somehow
onyhow
and
moore
to
win
so
they
settled
it
and
so
be
onless
wullie
onless
but
curse
it
i
no
the
proof
and
he
hammered
the
table
before
him
and
stamped
on
the
floor
at
midnight
he
arose
a
mad
desperate
plan
looming
through
his
fuddled
brain
i
swore
i
pay
him
wullie
and
i
will
if
i
hang
for
it
i
be
even
wi
him
i
haena
the
proof
but
i
i
he
groped
his
way
to
the
mantel
piece
with
blind
eyes
and
swirling
brain
reaching
up
with
fumbling
hands
he
took
down
the
old
blunderbuss
from
above
the
fireplace
wullie
he
whispered
chuckling
hideously
wullie
come
on
you
and
i
he
he
but
the
tailless
tyke
was
not
there
at
nightfall
he
had
slouched
silently
out
of
the
house
on
business
he
best
wot
of
so
his
master
crept
out
of
the
room
alone
on
tiptoe
still
chuckling
the
cool
night
air
refreshed
him
and
he
stepped
stealthily
along
his
quaint
weapon
over
his
shoulder
down
the
hill
across
the
bottom
skirting
the
pike
till
he
reached
the
over
the
wastrel
he
crossed
it
safely
that
providence
whose
care
is
drunkards
placing
his
footsteps
then
he
stole
up
the
slope
like
a
hunter
stalking
his
prey
arrived
at
the
gate
he
raised
himself
cautiously
and
peered
over
into
the
moonlit
yard
there
was
no
sign
or
sound
of
living
creature
the
little
gray
house
slept
peacefully
in
the
shadow
of
the
pike
all
unaware
of
the
man
with
murder
in
his
heart
laboriously
climbing
the
the
door
of
the
porch
was
wide
the
chain
hanging
limply
down
unused
and
the
little
man
could
see
within
the
moon
shining
on
the
iron
studs
of
the
inner
door
and
the
blanket
of
him
who
should
have
slept
there
and
did
not
he
no
there
wullie
he
no
there
he
jumped
down
from
the
gate
throwing
all
caution
to
the
winds
he
reeled
recklessly
across
the
yard
the
drunken
delirium
of
battle
was
on
him
the
fever
of
anticipated
victory
flushed
his
veins
at
length
he
would
take
toll
for
the
injuries
of
years
another
moment
and
he
was
in
front
of
the
good
oak
door
battering
at
it
madly
with
clubbed
weapon
yelling
dancing
screaming
vengeance
where
is
he
what
he
at
come
and
tell
me
that
james
moore
come
doon

say
ye

or

the
soft
moonlight
streamed
down
on
the
madman
thundering
at
the
door
screaming
his
the
quiet
farmyard
startled
from
its
sleep
awoke
in
an
uproar
cattle
shifted
in
their
stalls
horses
whinnied
fowls
chattered
aroused
by
the
din
and
dull
thudding
of
the
blows
and
above
the
rest
loud
and
piercing
the
shrill
cry
of
a
terrified
child
maggie
wakened
from
a
vivid
dream
of
david
chasing
the
police
hurried
a
shawl
around
her
and
in
a
minute
had
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
was
comforting
her
vaguely
fearing
the
while
that
the
police
were
after
david
james
moore
flung
open
a
window
and
leaning
out
looked
down
on
the
dishevelled
figure
below
him
heard
the
noise
glanced
up
and
saw
his
enemy
straightway
he
ceased
his
attack
on
the
door
and
running
beneath
the
window
shook
his
weapon
up
at
his
foe
there
ye
are
are
ye
curse
ye
for
a
coward
curse

for
a
liar

and
for
let

oor
the
master
looking
down
from
above
thought
that
at
length
the
little
man
brain
had
gone
what
yo
want
he
asked
as
calmly
as
he
could
hoping
to
gain
time
what
i

screamed
the
madman
hark
to
him
he
crosses
me
in
ilka

plots
agin
me
he
robs
me
o
ma

he
sets

the
master
interposed
again
i
coom
doon
and
talk
things
over
wi
he
said
soothingly
but
before
he
could
withdraw
had
jerked
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
and
aimed
it
full
at
his
enemy
head
the
threatened
man
looked
down
the
gun
great
quivering
mouth
wholly
unmoved
yo
mon
hold
it
steadier
little
mon
if
yo
hit
he
said
grimly
there
i
coom
help
yo
he
withdrew
slowly
and
all
the
time
was
wondering
where
the
gray
dog
was
in
another
moment
he
was
downstairs
undoing
the
bolts
and
bars
of
the
door
on
the
other
side
stood
his
blunderbuss
at
his
shoulder
his
finger
trembling
on
the
trigger
waiting
hi
master
stop
or
yo
dead
roared
a
voice
from
the
loft
on
the
other
side
the
yard
feyther
feyther
git
yo
back
screamed
maggie
who
saw
it
all
from
the
window
above
the
door
their
cries
were
too
late
the
blunderbuss
went
off
with
a
roar
belching
out
a
storm
of
sparks
and
smoke
the
shot
peppered
the
door
like
hail
and
the
whole
yard
seemed
for
a
moment
wrapped
in
flame
aw
oh
ma
gummy
a
waounded
a
a
goner
a
shot
murder
eh
oh
bellowed
a
lusty
voice
and
it
was
not
james
moore
the
little
man
the
cause
of
the
uproar
lay
quite
still
upon
the
ground
with
another
figure
standing
over
him
as
he
had
stood
finger
on
trigger
waiting
for
that
last
bolt
to
be
drawn
a
gray
form
shooting
whence
no
one
knew
had
suddenly
and
silently
attacked
him
from
behind
and
jerked
him
backward
to
the
ground
with
the
shock
of
the
fall
the
blunderbuss
had
gone
off
the
last
bolt
was
thrown
back
with
a
clatter
and
the
master
emerged
in
a
glance
he
took
in
the
whole
scene
the
fallen
man
the
gray
dog
the
weapon
yo
bob
lad
he
said
i
was
wonderin
wheer

a
he
walked
up
to
who
still
lay
gasping
on
the
ground
the
shock
of
the
fall
and
recoil
of
the
weapon
had
knocked
the
breath
out
of
the
little
man
body
beyond
that
he
was
barely
hurt
the
master
stood
over
his
fallen
enemy
and
looked
sternly
down
at
him

with
that
he
retired
to
bed
early
in
the
morning
he
went
to
release
his
prisoner
but
he
was
a
minute
too
late
for
scuttling
down
the
slope
and
away
was
a
little
tottering
figure
with
white
hair
blowing
in
the
wind

little
man

broken
away

and
fell
with
a
loud

into

spot
into

had
plunged

down
at

struggling
in

made
a
half
move

day
it
broke
calm
and
beautiful
no
cloud
on
the
horizon
no
threat
of
storm
in
the
air
a
fitting
day
on
which
the
shepherds
trophy
must
be
won
outright
and
well
it
was
so
for
never
since
the
founding
of
the
dale
trials
had
such
a
concourse
been
gathered
together
on
the
north
bank
of
the
silver
lea
from
the
highlands
they
came
from
the
far
campbell
country
from
the
peak
from
the
county
of
many
acres
from
all
along
the
silver
fringes
of
the
solway
assembling
in
that
quiet
corner
of
the
earth
to
see
the
famous
gray
dog
of
kenmuir
fight
his
last
great
battle
for
the
shepherds
trophy
by
noon

down
on
such
a
gathering
as
it
had
never
seen
the
paddock
at
the
back
of

packed
with
a
clammering
chattering

animated

of
farmers
bevies
of
solid
rustics
townsmen
bookmakers
giggling
girls
amorous
boys
thrown
together
like
toys
in
a

whilst
here
and
there
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
lonely
man
and
dog
come
from
afar
to
wrest
his
proud
title
from
the
best
in
the
north
at
the
back
of
the
enclosure
was
drawn
up
a
formidable
array
of
carts
and
carriages
varying
as
much
in
quality

as
did

about

waving

and
shouting
from
very
joyousness
thick
as
flies
clustered
that
motley
assembly
on
the
north
bank
of
the
silver
lea
while
on
the
other
side
the
stream
was
a
little
group
of
judges
inspecting
the
course
the

laid
out
ran
thus
the

must
first
be
found
in
the

of

then
up

and
away
from

around
a

down

through

to

down

to
the

was
set
up

the

was
reached
in

the

and
in
another
second
the

would
have
been
locked
inseparably
but
just
in
time
intervened
one
of
the
judges
came
hurrying
up

cried
angrily

was
unheeded
the
battle
for
the
cup
had
begun
little
pip
leading
the
dance
on
the
opposite
slope
the
babel
had
subsided
now
hucksters
left
their
wares
and
bookmakers
their
stools
to
watch
the
struggle
every
eye
was
intent
on
the
moving
figures
of
man
and
dog
and
three
sheep
over
the
stream
one
after
one
the
competitors
ran
their
course
and
penned
their
sheep
there
was
no
single
failure
and
all
received
their
just
meed
of
applause
save
only
adam
red
wull
last
of
all
when
owd
bob
trotted
out
to
uphold
his
title
there
went
up
such
a
shout
as
made
maggie
wan
cheeks
to
blush
with
pleasure
and
wee
anne
to
scream
right
lustily
his
was
an
incomparable
exhibition
sheep
should
be
humored
rather
than
hurried
coaxed
rather
than
coerced
and
that
has
attained
the
summit
of
his
art
who
subdues
his
own
personality
and
leads
his
sheep
in
pretending
to
be
led
well
might
the
bosoms
of
the
dalesmen
swell
with
pride
as
they
watched
their
favorite
at
his
work
well
might
tammas
pull
out
that
hackneyed
phrase
the
brains
of
a
mon
and
the
way
of
a
woman
well
might
the
crowd
bawl
their
enthusiasm
and
long
kirby
puff
his
cheeks
and
rattle
the
money
in
his
trouser
pockets
but
of
this
part
it
is
enough
to
say
that
pip
owd
bob
and
red
wull
were
selected
to
fight
out
the
struggle
afresh
the
course
was
altered
and
stiffened
on
the
far
side
the
stream
it
remained
as
before
up
the
slope
round
a
flag
down
the
hill
again
through
the
gap
in
the
wall
along
the
hillside
down
through
the
two
flags
turn
and
to
the
stream
again
but
the
pen
was
removed
from
its
former
position
carried
over
the
bridge
up
the
near
slope
and
the
hurdles
put
together
at
the
very
foot
of
the
spectators
the
sheep
had
to
be
driven
over
the
plank
bridge
and
the
penning
done
beneath
the
very
nose
of
the
crowd
a
stiff
course
if
ever
there
was
one
and
the
time
allowed
ten
short
minutes
the
spectators
hustled
and
elbowed
in
their
endeavors
to
obtain
a
good
position
and
well
they
might
for
about
to
begin
was
the
finest
exhibition
of
any
man
there
was
ever
to
behold
evan
jones
and
little
pip
led
off
those
two
who
had
won
on
many
a
field
worked
together
as
they
had
never
worked
before
smooth
and
swift
like
a
yacht
in
southampton
water
round
the
flag
through
the
gap
they
brought
their
sheep
down
between
the
two
flags
accomplishing
right
well
that
awkward
turn
and
back
to
the
bridge
there
they
stopped
the
sheep
would
not
face
that
narrow
way
once
twice
and
again
they
broke
and
each
time
the
gallant
little
pip
his
tongue
out
and
tail
quivering
brought
them
back
to
the
at
length
one
faced
it
then
another
and
it
was
too
late
time
was
up
the
judges
signalled
and
the
welshman
called
off
his
dog
and
withdrew
out
of
sight
of
mortal
eye
in
a
dip
of
the
ground
evan
jones
sat
down
and
took
the
small
dark
head
between
his
knees
and
you
may
be
sure
the
dog
heart
was
heavy
as
the
man
we
did
our
pest
pip
he
cried
brokenly
but
we
peat
the
first
time
ever
we
been
no
time
to
dally
james
moore
and
owd
bob
were
off
on
their
last
run
no
applause
this
time
not
a
voice
was
raised
anxious
faces
twitching
fingers
the
whole
crowd
tense
as
a
stretched
wire
a
false
turn
a
wilful
sheep
a
cantankerous
judge
and
the
gray
dog
would
be
beat
and
not
a
man
there
but
knew
it
yet
over
the
stream
master
and
dog
went
about
their
business
never
so
quiet
never
so
collected
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
rounding
up
a
flock
on
the
muir
pike
the
old
dog
found
his
sheep
in
a
twinkling
and
a
wild
scared
trio
they
proved
rounding
the
first
flag
one
wether
made
a
dash
for
the
open
he
was
quick
but
the
gray
dog
was
quicker
a
splendid
recover
and
a
sound
like
a
sob
from
the
watchers
on
the
hill
down
the
slope
they
came
for
the
gap
in
the
wall
a
little
below
the
opening
james
moore
took
his
stand
to
stop
and
turn
them
while
a
distance
behind
his
sheep
loitered
owd
bob
seeming
to
follow
rather
than
drive
yet
watchful
of
every
movement
and
anticipating
it
on
he
came
one
eye
on
his
master
the
other
on
his
sheep
never
hurrying
them
never
flurrying
them
yet
bringing
them
rapidly
along
no
word
was
spoken
barely
a
gesture
made
yet
they
worked
master
and
dog
like
one
divided
through
the
gap
along
the
hill
parallel
to
the
spectators
playing
into
one
another
hands
like
men
at
polo
a
wide
sweep
for
the
turn
at
the
flags
and
the
sheep
wheeled
as
though
at
the
word
of
command
dropped
through
them
and
travelled
rapidly
for
the
bridge

coming
the
pace
down
the
hill
had
grown
quicker
too
quick
close
on
the
bridge
the
three
sheep
made
an
effort
to
break
a
dash
and
two
were
checked
but
the
third
went
away
like
the
wind
and
after
him
owd
bob
a
gray
streak
against
the
green
tammas
was
cursing
silently
kirby
was
white
to
the
lips
and
in
the
stillness
you
could
plainly
hear
the

sobbing

as

fluttered
in
their
throats

step
at
a
time
toward

in

the

stopped
and
tried
to

and

was
flying

and
the

alone
must
take
minutes
many
a

was
at

forward
against
the
next
and
they
were
over
and
making
up
the
slope
amidst
a
thunder
of
applause
at
the
pen
it
was
a
sight
to
see
shepherd

dog
working
together
the
master
his
face
stern
and
a

than

up
from

crowd
maggie
white
face
turned
pink
and
the
dalesmen
mopped
their

brows
the
mob
surged
forward
but
the
stewards
held
them
back
back
please
do
encroach

come
from
the
far
bank
the
little
man
watched
the
scene
his
coat
and
cap
were
off
and
his
hair
gleamed
white
in
the
sun
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
his
face
was
twitching
but
set
as
he
stood
ready
the
hubbub
over
the
stream
at
length
subsided
one
of
the
judges
nodded
to

on

sheep
before
they

it
and
they
went
away
with
a
rush
with
him
right
on
their
backs
up
the
slope
they
swept
and
round
the
first
flag
already
galloping
down
the
hill
for
the
gap
and
was
flying
ahead
to
turn
them
but
they
passed
him
like
a
hurricane
and
red
wull
was
in
front
with
a
rush
and
turned
them
alone
wins
five
to

i
lay
agin
owd

rang
out
a
clear
voice
in
the
silence
through
the
gap
they
rattled

feet
twinkling
like
the
wings
of
driven
grouse
he

they

they
away
was
the
cry
was
half
up
the
wheel
of
the
kenmuir
wagon
every
man
was
on
his
toes
ladies
were
standing
in
their
carriages
even
jim
mason
face
flushed
with
momentary
excitement
the
sheep
were
tearing
along
the
hillside
all
together
like
a
white
scud
after
them
galloping
like
a
waterloo
winner
raced
red
wull
and
last
of
all
leaping
over
the
ground
like

demoniac
making
not
for

the
the

roared
a
strident
voice
wins
five

i

rang
out
the
clear
reply
red
wull
was
now
racing
parallel
to
the
fugitives
and
above
them
all
four
were
travelling
at
a
terrific
rate
while
the
two
flags
were
barely
twenty
yards
in
front
below
the
line
of
flight
and
almost
parallel
to
it
to
effect
the
turn
a
change
of
direction
must
be
made
almost
through
a
right
angle
he

nohow
was
the
roar
from
over
the
stream
a
yell
turn
wullie
at
the
word
the
great
dog
swerved
down
on
the
flying
three
they
turned
still
at
the
gallop
like
a
troop
of
cavalry
and
dropped
clean
and
neat
between
the
flags
and
down
to
the
stream
they
rattled
passing
on
the
way
as
though
he
was
standing
weel
done
wullie
came
the
scream
from
the
far
bank
and
from
the
crowd
went
up
an
involuntary
burst
of
applause
ma
word
did
yo
see
that
by
gob
it
was
a
turn
indeed
of
which
the
smartest
team
in
the
galloping
might
well
have
been
proud
a
shade
later
and
they
must
have
overshot
the
mark
a
shade
sooner
and
a
miss
he
not
been
two
minutes
so
far
we
beaten
do
you
think
so
uncle
leggy
asked
muriel
sylvester
looking
up
piteously
into
the
parson
face
it
not
what
i
think
my
dear
it
what
the
judges
think
the
parson
replied
and
what
he
thought
their
verdict
would
be
was
plainly
writ
on
his
face
for
all
to
read
right
on
to
the
centre
of
the
bridge
the
leading
sheep
galloped
and
stopped
abruptly
up
above
in
the
crowd
there
was
utter
silence
staring
eyes
rigid
fingers
the
sweat
was
dripping
off
long
kirby
face
and
at
the
back
a
bookmaker
slipped
his
in
his
pocket
and
glanced
behind
him
james
moore
standing
in
front
of
them
all
was
the
calmest
there
red
wull
was
not
to
be
denied
like
his
forerunner
he
leapt
on
the
back
of
the
hindmost
sheep
but
the
red
dog
was
heavy
where
the
gray
was
light
the
sheep
staggered
slipped
and
fell
almost
before
it
had
touched
the
water
his
face
afire
and
eyes
flaming
was
in
the
stream
in
a
second
he
had
hold
of
the
struggling
creature
and
with
an
almost
superhuman
effort
had
half
thrown
half
shoved
it
on
to
the
bank
again
a
tribute
of
admiration
led
by
james
moore
the
little
man
scrambled
panting
on
to
the
bank
and
raced
after
sheep
and
dog
his
face
was
white
beneath
the
perspiration
his
breath
came
in
quavering
gasps
his
trousers
were
wet
and
clinging
to
his
legs
he
was
trembling
in
every
limb
and
yet
indomitable
they
were
up
to
the
pen
and
the
last
wrestle
began
the
crowd
silent
and
motionless
craned
forward
to
watch
the
uncanny
little
man
and
the
huge
dog
working
so
close
below
them
face
was
white
his
eyes
staring
unnaturally
bright
his
bent
body
projected
forward
and
he
tapped
with
his
stick
on
the
ground
like
a
blind
man
coaxing
the
sheep
in
and
the
tailless
tyke
his
tongue
out
and
flanks
heaving
crept
and
crawled
and
worked
up
to
the
opening
patient
as
he
had
never
been
before
they
were
in
at
last
there
was
a
lukewarm
cheer
then
silence
exhausted
and
trembling
the
little
man
leant
against
the
pen
one
hand
on
it
while
red
wull
his
flanks
still
heaving
gently
licked
the
other
quite
close
stood
james
moore
and
the
gray
dog
above
was
the
black
wall
of
people
utterly
still
below
the
judges
comparing
notes
in
the
silence
you
could
almost
hear
the
panting
of
the
crowd
then
one
of
the
judges
went
up
to
james
moore
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
the
gray
dog
had
won
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
had
won
the
shepherds
trophy
outright
a
second
palpitating
silence
a
woman
hysterical
laugh
and
a
bellow
rent
the
expectant
air
shouts
screams
blending
in
a
din
that
made
the
waters
of
the
silver
lea
quiver
and
quiver
again
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
had
won
the
shepherds
trophy
outright
maggie
face
flushed
a
scarlet
hue
wee
anne
flung
fat
arms
toward
her
triumphant
bob
and
screamed
with
the
best
squire
and
parson
each
were
boisterously
shaking
hands
long
kirby
who
had
not
prayed
for
thirty
years
ejaculated
with
heartfelt
earnestness
thank
god
todd
bellowed
in
tammas
ear
and
almost
slew
him
with
his
mighty
buffets
among
the
dalesmen
some
laughed
like
drunken
men
some
cried
like
children
all
joined
in
that
roaring
song
of
victory
to
little
m
standing
with
his
back
to
the
crowd
that
storm
of
cheering
came
as
the
first
announcement
of
defeat
a
wintry
smile
like
the
sun
over
a
march
sea
crept
across
his
face
we
might
a
kent
it
wullie
he
muttered
soft
and
low
the
tension
loosed
the
battle
lost
the
little
man
almost
broke
down
there
were
red
dabs
of
color
in
his
face
his
eyes
were
big
his
lips
pitifully
quivering
he
was
near
to
sobbing
an
old
man
utterly
alone
he
had
staked
his
all
on
a
throw
and
lost
lady
eleanour
marked
the
forlorn
little
figure
standing
solitary
on
the
fringe
of
the
uproarious
mob
she
noticed
the
expression
on
his
face
and
her
tender
heart
went
out
to
the
lone
man
in
his
defeat
she
went
up
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
mr
she
said
timidly
wo
you
come
and
sit
down
in
the
tent
you
look
tired
i
can
find
you
a
corner
where
no
one
shall
disturb
the
little
man
wrenched
roughly
away
the
unexpected
kindness
coming
at
that
moment
was
almost
too
much
for
him
a
few
paces
off
he
turned
again
it
reel
kind
o
yer
ladyship
he
said
huskily
and
tottered
away
to
be
alone
with
red
wull
meanwhile
the
victors
stood
like
rocks
in
the
tideway
about
them
surged
a
continually
changing
throng
shaking
the
man
hand
patting
the
dog

had
carried

to
tender
her
congratulations

into

crowd
but
in

minute

fought

way
back
i
forgotten
something
he
shouted
tell
your
maggie
perhaps

and
he

boisterous
triumph

lady

made
a
prettier
speech
than
ever
yet
all
the
while
she
was
haunted
by
a
white
miserable
face
and
all
the
while
she
was
conscious
of
two
black
moving
dots
in
the
murk
muir

opposite
her
solitary
desolate
a
contrast
to
the
huzzaing
crowd
around

now
to

part
vi
the
black
killer
chapter
xxvi
the
sun
was
hiding
behind
the
pike
over
the
lowlands
the
feathery
breath
of
night
hovered
still
and
the
hillside
was
shivering
in
the
chillness
of
dawn
down
on
the
silvery
sward
beside
the
stony
bottom
there
lay
the
ruffled
body
of
a
dead
sheep
all
about
the
victim
the
dewy
ground
was
dark
and
patchy
like
dishevelled
velvet
bracken
trampled
down
stones
displaced
as
though
by
straggling
feet
and
the
whole
spotted
with
the
red
a
score
yards
up
the
hill
in
a
writhing
confusion
of
red
and
gray
two
dogs
at
while
yet
higher
a
pack
of
watched
fascinated
the
bloody
drama
the
fight
raged
red
and
gray
the
crimson
froth
dripping
from
their
jaws
now
rearing
high
with
arching
crests
and
wrestling
paws
now
rolling
over
in
tumbling
tossing
worrying
disorder
the
two
fought
out
their
above
the
flock
huddled
and
stamped
ever
edging
nearer
to
watch
the
issue
just
so
must
the
women
of
rome
have
craned
round
the
arenas
to
see
two
men
striving
in
the
first
cold
flicker
of
dawn
stole
across
the
green
the
red
eye
of
the
morning
peered
aghast
over
the
shoulder
of
the
pike
and
from
the
sleeping
dale
there
arose
the
yodling
of
a
man
driving
his
cattle
home
day
was
upon
them
james
moore
was
waked
by
a
little
whimpering
cry
beneath
his
window
he
leapt
out
of
bed
and
rushed
to
look
for
well
he
knew
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
old
dog
was
calling
lord
o
mercy
whativer
come
to
yo
owd
un
he
cried
in
anguish
and
indeed
his
favorite
almost
past
recognition
presented
a
pitiful
spectacle
in
a
moment
the
master
was
downstairs
and
out
examining
him
poor
old
lad
yo
have
caught
it
this
time
he
cried
there
was
a
ragged
tear
on
the
dog
cheek
a
deep
gash
in
his
throat
from
which
the
blood
still
welled
staining
the
white
escutcheon
on
his
chest
while
head
and
neck
were
clotted
with
the
red
hastily
the
master
summoned
maggie
after
her
andrew
came
hurrying
down
and
a
little
later
a
tiny
figure
appeared
in
the
door
and
then
fled
screaming
they
doctored
the
old
warrior
on
the
table
in
the
kitchen
maggie
tenderly
washed
his
wounds
and
dressed
them
with
gentle
pitying
fingers
and
he
stood
all
the
while
grateful
yet
fidgeting
looking
up
into
his
master
face
as
if
imploring
to
be
gone
he
mun
a
had
a
rare
tussle
wi
some
one
eh
dad
said
the
girl
as
she
worked
ay
and
wi
whom
was
for
nowt
he
got
fightin
i
nay
he
a
tale
to
tell
has
the
owd
un
and
a
i
thowt
as
much
look
for
bathing
the
bloody
jaws
he
had
come
upon
a
cluster
of
tawny
red
hair
hiding
in
the
corners
of
the
lips
the
secret
was
out
those
few
hairs
told
their
own
accusing
tale
to
but
one
creature
in
the
daleland
could
they
belong
th
tailless
he
mun
a
bin
trespassin
cried
andrew
ay
and
up
to
some
o
his
bloody
work
i
lay
my
life
the
master
answered
but
th
owd
un
shall
show
the
old
dog
hurts
proved
less
severe
than
had
at
first
seemed
possible
his
good
gray
coat
about
his
throat
had
never
served
him
in
such
good
stead
and
at
length
the
wounds
washed
and
sewn
up
he
jumped
down
all
in
a
hurry
from
the
table
and
made
for
the
door
noo
owd
lad
yo
may
show
us
said
the
master
and
with
andrew
hurried
after
him
down
the
hill
along
the
stream
and
over
langholm
how
and
as
they
neared
the
stony
bottom
the
sheep
herding
in
groups
raised
frightened
heads
to
stare
of
a
sudden
a
cloud
of
poisonous
flies
rose
buzzing
up
before
them
and
there
in
a
dimple
of
the
ground
lay
a
murdered
sheep
deserted
by
its
comrades
the
glazed
eyes
staring
helplessly
upward
the
throat
horribly
worried
it
slept
its
last
sleep
the
matter
was
plain
to
see
at
last
the
black
killer
had
visited
kenmuir
i
guessed
as
much
said
the
master
standing
over
the
mangled
body
well
it
the
worst
night
work
ever
the
killer
done
i
owd
un
come
on
him
while
he
was
at
it
and
then
they
fought
and
ma
word
it
munn
ha
bin
a
fight
for
all
around
were
traces
of
that
terrible
struggle
the
earth
torn
up
and
tossed
bracken
uprooted
and
throughout
little
dabs
of
wool
and
tufts
of
tawny
hair
mingling
with
wisps
james
moore
walked
slowly
over
the
battlefield
stooping
down
as
though
he
were
gleaning
and
gleaning
he
was
a
long
time
he
bent
so
and
at
length
raised
himself
the
killer
has
killed
his
last
he
muttered
red
wull
has
run
his
then
turning
to
andrew
run
yo
home
lad
and
fetch
the
men
to
carry
yon
away
pointing
to
the
carcass
and
bob
lad
yo
done
your
work
for
and
right
well
too
go
yo
home
wi
him
i
off
to
see
to
this
he
turned
and
crossed
the
stony
bottom
his
face
was
set
like
a
rock
at
length
the
proof
was
in
his
hand
once
and
for
all
the
should
be
rid
of
its
scourge
as
he
stalked
up
the
hill
a
dark
head
appeared
at
his
knee
two
big
grey
eyes
half
doubting
half
penitent
wholly
wistful
looked
up
at
him
and
a
silvery
brush
signalled
a
mute
request
eh
owd
un
but
yo
should
ha
gone
wi
andrew
the
master
said
hooiver
as
yo
are
here
come
and
he
strode
away
up
the
hill
gaunt
and
menacing
with
the
gray
dog
at
his
heels
as
they
approached
the
house
was
standing
in
the
door
sucking
his
eternal
twig
james
moore
eyed
him
closely
as
he
came
but
the
sour
face
framed
in
the
door
betrayed
nothing
sarcasm
surprise
challenge
were
all
writ
there
plain
to
read
but
no
guilty
consciousness
of
the
other
errand
no
storm
of
passion
to
hide
a
failing
heart
if
it
was
acting
it
was
splendidly
done
as
man
and
dog
passed
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
the
expression
on
the
little
man
face
changed
again
he
started
forward
james
moore
as
i
live
he
cried
and
advanced
with
both
hands
extended
as
though
welcoming
a
brother
and
it
a
weary
while
sin
ye
honored
ma
puir
and
in
fact
it
was
nigh
twenty
years

ben
and
let

crack
james
moore
kens

ma
bit
the
master
ignored
the
greeting
one
o
ma
sheep
been
killed
back
o
t
dyke
he
announced
shortly
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
the
killer
the
the
cordiality
beaming
in
every
wrinkle
of
the
little
man
face
was
absorbed
in
a
wondering
interest
and
that
again
gave
place
to
sorrowful
sympathy
dear
dear
it
come
to
that
has
it
at
last
he
said
gently
and
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
gray
dog
and
dwelt
mournfully
upon
him
man

heaved
a
sigh
profoundly
melancholy
tenderly
sympathetic
then
brightening
up
a
little
ye

for

gun
james
moore
listened
to
this
harangue
at
first
puzzled
then
he
caught
the
other
meaning
and
his
eyes
flashed
ye
fool
did
ye
hear

worryin
his
master

the
little
man
was
smiling
and
suave

softly
together

he
asked
looking
up
into
the
other
face
as
if
daring
him
to
speak
the
master
shaggy
eyebrows
lowered
he
towered
above
the
other
like
the
muir
pike
above
its
surrounding
hills

replied
coldly
and
i

in

dancing
up
to
his
antagonist

he
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
other
face
the
master
was
now
as
calm
as
his
foe
was
passionate
where
he
replied
sternly
why
there
holding
out
his
right
hand
yon
proof
enough
to
hang
a
for
lying
in
his
broad
palm
was
a

to

there
for

he
cried
and
spat
deliberately
down
into
the
other
naked
palm
then
he
stood
back
facing
his
enemy
in
a
manner
to
have
done
credit
to
a
nobler
deed
james
moore
strode
forward
it
looked
as
if
he
was
about
to
make
an
end
of
his
miserable
adversary
so
strongly
was
he
moved
his
chest
heaved
and
the
blue
eyes
blazed
but
just
as
one
had
thought
to
see
him
take
his
foe
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
crush
him
who
should
come
stalking
round
the
corner
of
the
house
but
the
tailless
tyke
a
droll
spectacle
he
made
laughable
even
at
that
moment
he
limped
sorely
his
head
and
neck
were
swathed
in
bandages
and
beneath
their
ragged
fringe
the
little
eyes
gleamed
out
fiery
and
bloodshot
round
the
corner
he
came
unaware
of
strangers
then
straightway
recognizing
his
visitors
halted
abruptly
his
hackles
ran
up
each
individual
hair
stood
on
end
till
his
whole
body
resembled
a
and
a
snarl
like
a
rusty
brake
shoved
hard
down
escaped
from
between
his
teeth
then
he
trotted
heavily
forward
his
head
sinking
low
and
lower
as
he
came
and
owd
bob
eager
to
take
up
the
gage
of
battle
advanced
glad
and
gallant
to
meet
him
daintily
he
picked
his
way
across
the
yard
head
and
tail
erect
perfectly
only
the
long
gray
hair
about
his
neck
stood
up
like
the
ruff
of
a
lady
of
the
court
of
queen
elizabeth
but
the
warriors
were
not
to
be
allowed
their
will
wullie
wullie
wad

cried
the
little
man
bob
lad
coom
in
called
the
other
then
he
turned
and
looked
down
at
the
man
beside
him
contempt
flaunting
in
every
feature
well
he
said
shortly
hands
were
opening
and
shutting
his
face
was
quite
white
beneath
the
tan
but

spoke
calmly

little
man
must
be

lying
palpably
yet
he
spoke
with
an
earnestness
a
seeming
belief
in
his
own
story
that
might
have
convinced
one
who
knew
him
less
well
but
the
master
only
looked
down

with
a
great
scorn

his

dreadful

in

hideous
determinedness
chapter
xxvii
for
the
defence
that
night
a
vague
story
was
whispered
in
the
sylvester
arms
but
tammas
on
being
interrogated
pursed
his
lips
and
said
nay
i
sworn
to
say
which
was
the
old
man
way
of
putting
that
he
knew
nowt
on
thursday
morning
james
moore
and
andrew
came
down
arrayed
in
all
their
best
it
was
the
day
of
the
squire
annual
dinner
to
his
tenants
the
two
however
were
not
allowed
to
start
upon
their
way
until
they
had
undergone
a
critical
inspection
by
maggie
for
the
girl
liked
her
mankind
to
do
honor
to
kenmuir
on
these
occasions
so
she
brushed
up
andrew
tied
his
scarf
saw
his
boots
and
hands
were
clean
and
titivated
him
generally
till
she
had
converted
the
ungainly
hobbledehoy
into
a
thoroughly
likely
young
and
all
the
while
she
was
thinking
of
that
other
boy
for
whom
on
such
gala
days
she
had
been
wont
to
perform
like
offices
and
her
father
marking
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
mindful
of
the
squire
mysterious
hint
said
gently
cheer
up
lass
happen
i
ha
news
for
you
the
night
the
girl
nodded
and
smiled
wanly
happen
so
dad
she
said
but
in
her
heart
she
doubted
nevertheless
it
was
with
a
cheerful
countenance
that
a
little
later
she
stood
in
the
door
with
wee
anne
and
owd
bob
and
waved
the
travellers
godspeed
while
the
lassie
fiercely
gripping
the
old
dog
tail
with
one
hand
and
her
sister
with
the
other
screamed
them
a
wordless
farewell
the
sun
had
reached
its
highest
when
the
two
wayfarers
passed
through
the
gray
portals
of
the
manor
in
the
stately
entrance
hall
imposing
with
all
the
evidences
of
a
long
and
honorable
line
were
gathered
now
the
many
tenants
throughout
the
wide
march
mere
estate
sons
of
the
soil
most
of
them
many
of
them
like
james
moore
whose
fathers
had
for
generations
owned
and
farmed
the
land
they
now
leased
at
the
hands
of
the
sylvesters
there
in
the
old
hall
they
were
assembled
a
mighty
host
and
apart
from
the
others
standing
as
though
in
irony
beneath
the
frown
of
one
of
those
warriors
who
held
the
door
was
little
puny
always
paltry
now
mocking
his
manhood
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
opened
and
the
squire
entered
beaming
on
every
one
here
you
are
eh
eh
how
are
you
all
glad
to
see
ye
james
saunderson
to
you
all
bringin
a
friend
with
me
eh
eh
and
he
stood
aside
to
let
by
his
agent
parson
leggy
and
last
of
all
shy
and
blushing
a
young
giant
if
it
bai
david
was
the
cry
eh
lad
we
fain
to
see
yo
and
yo
lookin
stout
surely
and
they
thronged
about
the
boy
shaking
him
by
the
hand
and
asking
him
his
story
was
but
a
simple
tale
after
his
flight
on
the
eventful
night
he
had
gone
south
drovering
he
had
written
to
maggie
and
been
surprised
and
hurt
to
receive
no
reply
in
vain
he
had
waited
and
too
proud
to
write
again
had
remained
ignorant
of
his
father
recovery
neither
caring
nor
daring
to
return
then
by
mere
chance
he
had
met
the
squire
at
the
york
and
that
kind
man
who
knew
his
story
had
eased
his
fears
and
obtained
from
him
a
promise
to
return
as
soon
as
the
term
of
his
engagement
had
expired
and
there
he
was
the
dalesmen
gathered
round
the
boy
listening
to
his
tale
and
in
return
telling
him
the
home
news
and
chaffing
him
about
maggie
of
all
the
people
present
only
one
seemed
unmoved
and
that
was
when
first
david
had
entered
he
had
started
forward
a
flush
of
color
warming
his
thin
cheeks
but
no
one
had
noticed
his
emotion
and
now
back
again
beneath
his
armor
he
watched
the
scene
a
sour
smile
playing
about
his
lips
i
think
the
lad
might
ha
the
grace
to
come
and
say
he
sorry
for
to
murder
me
hooiver
with
a
characteristic
shrug
i
suppose
i
then
the
gong
rang
out
its
summons
and
the
squire
led
the
way
into
the
great
at
the
one
end
of
the
long
table
heavy
with
all
the
solid
delicacies
of
such
a
feast
he
took
his
seat
with
the
master
of
kenmuir
upon
his
right
at
the
other
end
was
parson
leggy
while
down
the
sides
the
stalwart
dalesmen
were
arrayed
with
a
little
lost
figure
in
the
centre
at
first
they
talked
but
little
awed
like
children
knives
plied
glasses
tinkled
the
carvers
had
all
their
work
only
the
tongues
were
at
rest
but
the
squire
ringing
laugh
and
the
parson
cheery
tones
soon
put
them
at
their
ease
and
a
babel
of
voices
rose
and
waxed
of
them
all
only
sat
silent
he
talked
to
no
man
and
you
may
be
sure
no
one
talked
to
him
his
hand
crept
oftener
to
his
glass
than
plate
till
the
sallow
face
began
to
flush
and
the
dim
eyes
to
grow
unnaturally
bright
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
there
was
loud
tapping
on
the
table
calls
for
silence
and
men
pushed
back
their
chairs
the
squire
was
on
his
feet
to
make
his
annual
speech
he
started
by
telling
them
how
glad
he
was
to
see
them
there
he
made
an
allusion
to
owd
bob
and
the
shepherds
trophy
which
was
heartily
applauded
he
touched
on
the
black
killer
and
said
he
had
a
remedy
to
propose
that
th
owd
un
should
be
set
upon
the
criminal
track
a
suggestion
which
was
received
with
enthusiasm
while
cackling
laugh
could
be
heard
high
above
the
rest
from
that
he
dwelt
upon
the
existing
condition
of
agriculture
the
depression
in
which
he
attributed
to
the
late
radical
government
he
said
that
now
with
the
conservatives
in
office
and
a
ministry
composed
of
honorable
men
and
gentlemen
he
felt
convinced
that
things
would
brighten
the
radicals
one
ambition
was
to
set
class
against
class
landlord
against
tenant
well
during
the
last
five
hundred
years
the
sylvesters
had
rarely
been
he
was
sorry
to
have
to
confess
it
good
men
laughter
and
dissent
but
he
never
yet
heard
of
the
sylvester
though
he
should
say
it
who
was
a
bad
landlord
loud
applause
this
was
a
free
country
and
any
tenant
of
his
who
was
not
content
a
voice
says
we
bai
thank
you
thank
you
well
there
was
room
for
him
outside
cheers
he
thanked
god
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
during
the
forty
years
he
had
been
responsible
for
the
march
mere
estate
there
had
never
been
any
friction
between
him
and
his
people
cheers
and
he
did
think
there
ever
would
be
loud
cheers
thank
you
thank
you
and
his
motto
was
shun
a
radical
as
you
do
the
devil
and
he
was
very
glad
to
see
them
all
there
very
glad
and
he
wished
to
give
them
a
toast
the
queen
god
bless
her
and
wait
a
minute
with
her
majesty
name
to
couple
he
was
sure
that
gracious
lady
would
wish
it
that
of
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
then
he
sat
down
abruptly
amid
thundering
applause
the
toasts
duly
honoured
james
moore
by
prescriptive
right
as
master
of
kenmuir
rose
to
answer
he
began
by
saying
that
he
spoke
as
representing
all
the
tenants
but
he
was
interrupted
na
came
a
shrill
voice
from
down
the
table
yell
except
me
james
moore
i
as
lief
be
represented
by
judas
there
were
cries
of
hold
ye
gab
little
mon
and
the
squire
voice
that
do
the
little
man
restrained
his
tongue
but
his
eyes
gleamed
like
a
ferret
and
the
master
continued
his
speech
he
spoke
briefly
and
to
the
point
in
short
phrases
and
all
the
while
kept
up
a
running
commentary
at
length
he
could
control
himself
no
longer
half
rising
from
his
chair
he
leant
forward
with
hot
face
and
burning
eyes
and
cried
sit
doon
james
moore
hoo
daur
ye
stan
there
like
an
honest
man
ye
whitewashed
sepulchre
sit
doon
i
say
or
threateningly
wad
ye
hae
me
come
to
ye
at
that
the
dalesmen
laughed
uproariously
and
even
the
master
grim
face
relaxed
but
the
squire
voice
rang
out
sharp
and
stern
keep
silence
and
sit
down
hear
me
sir
if
i
have
to
speak
to
you
again
it
will
be
to
order
you
to
leave
the
the
little
man
obeyed
sullen
and
vengeful
like
a
beaten
cat
the
master
concluded
his
speech
by
calling
on
all
present
to
give
three
cheers
for
the
squire
her
ladyship
and
the
young
ladies
the
call
was
responded
to
enthusiastically
every
man
standing
just
as
the
noise
was
at
its
zenith
lady
eleanour
herself
with
her
two
fair
daughters
glided
into
the
gallery
at
the
end
of
the
hall
whereat
the
cheering
became
deafening
slowly
the
clamor
subsided
one
by
one
the
tenants
sat
down
at
length
there
was
left
standing
only
one
solitary
figure
m
his
face
was
set
and
he
gripped
the
chair
in
front
of
him
with
thin
nervous
hands
mr
sylvester
he
began
in
low
yet
clear
voice
ye
said
this
is
a
free
country
and
we
a
free
men
and
that
bein
so

liberty

a
word

maybe
the
last
time

be
wi
ye
so
i
hope
ye
listen
to
the
dalesmen
looked
surprised
and
the
squire
uneasy
nevertheless
he
nodded
assent
the
little
man
straightened
himself
his
face
was
tense
as
though
strung
up
to
a
high
resolve
all
the
passion
had
fled
from
it
all
the
bitterness
was
gone
and
left
behind
was
a
strange
enobling
earnestness
standing
there
in
the
silence
of
that
great
hall
with
every
eye
upon
him
he
looked
like
some
prisoner
at
the
bar
about
to
plead
for
his
life
gentlemen
he
began
i
bin
amang

noo
a

there

a

he
sat
down
in
the
great
hall
there
was
silence
save
for
a
tiny
sound
from
the
gallery
like
a
sob
suppressed
the
squire
rose
hurriedly
and
left
the
room
after
him
one
by
one
trailed
the
tenants
at
length
two
only
remained
sitting
solitary
with
a
long
array
of
empty
chairs
on
either
hand
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
parson
leggy
stern
upright
motionless
when
the
last
man
had
left
the
room
the
parson
rose
and
with
lips
strode
across
the
silent
hall
he
said
rapidly
and
almost
roughly
i
listened
to
what
you
said
as
i
think
we
all
have
with
a
sore
heart
you
hit
hard
but
i
think
you
were
right
and
if
i
not
done
my
duty
by
you
as
i
ought
and
i
fear
i
not
it
now
my
duty
as
god
minister
to
be
the
first
to
say
i
and
it
was
evident
from
his
face
what
an
effort
the
words
cost
him
the
little
man
tilted
back
his
chair
and
raised
his
head
it
was
the
old
who
looked
up
the
thin
lips
were
curled
a
grin
was
crawling
across
the
mocking
face
and
he
wagged
his
head
gently
as
he
looked
at
the
speaker
through
the
slits
of
his
eyes
mr
hornbut
i
believe
ye
thocht
me
in
earnest
and
i
do
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
softly
ye
swallered
it
all
down
like
best
butter
dear
dear
to
think
o
that
then
stretching
forward
mr
hornbut
i
was
playin
wi
the
parson
face
as
he
listened
was
ugly
to
watch
he
shot
out
a
hand
and
grabbed
the
scoffer
by
his
coat
then
dropped
it
again
and
turned
abruptly
away
as
he
passed
through
the
door
a
little
sneering
voice
called
after
him
mr
hornbut
i
ask
ye
hoo
you
a
minister
o
the
church
of
england
can
reconcile
it
to
yer
conscience
to
think
though
it
be
but
for
a
minute
that
there
can
be
ony
good
in
a
man
and
him
no
churchgoer
sir
ye
a
heretic
not
to
say
a
heathen
he
sniggered
to
himself
and
his
hand
crept
to
a
wine
decanter
an
hour
later
james
moore
his
business
with
the
squire
completed
passed
through
the
hall
on
his
way
out
its
only
occupant
was
now
and
the
master
walked
straight
up
to
his
enemy
he
said
gruffly
holding
out
a
sinewy
hand
i
like
to
say
the
little
man
knocked
aside
the
token
of
friendship
na
na

whitewash

th
warld
no

the
master
turned
away
and
his
face
was
hard
as
the
nether
millstone
but
the
little
man
pursued
him
i
was
nigh
forgettin
he
said

of

at

door
of
the
hall
the
master
met
david

moment

said
petulantly
i
would

sorry
as
he
turned
away
he
heard
the
boy

dull
and
sodden
as
he
crossed
the
hall
and
then
a
thin
cordial
voice
in
the
emptiness
i

he

dusk
was
merging
into
darkness
when
the
master
and
andrew
reached
the
dalesman
daughter
it
had
been
long
dark
when
they
emerged
from
the
cosy
parlor
of
the
inn
and
plunged
out
into
the
night
as
they
crossed
the
silver
lea
and
trudged
over
that
familiar
ground
where
a
fortnight
since
had
been
fought
out
the
battle
of
the
cup
the
wind
fluttered
past
them
in
spasmodic
gasps
there
trouble
in
the
wind
said
the
master
ay
answered
his
laconic
son
all
day
there
had
been
no
breath
of
air
and
the
sky
dangerously
blue
but
now
a
world
of
black
was
surging
up
from
the
horizon
smothering
the
night
and
small
dark
clouds
like
puffs
of
smoke
detaching
themselves
from
the
main
body
were
driving
tempestuously
forward
the
vanguard
of
the
storm
in
the
distance
was
a
low
rumbling
like
heavy
tumbrils
on
the
floor
of
heaven
all
about
the
wind
sounded
hollow
like
a
mighty
scythe
on
corn
the
air
was
oppressed
with
a
leaden
blackness
no
glimmer
of
light
on
any
hand
and
as
they
began
the
ascent
of
the
pass
they
reached
out
blind
hands
to
feel
along
the
a
cool
and
wetting
fell
a
few
big
splashed
heavily
down
the
wind
rose
with
a
leap
and
roared
past
them
up
the
rocky
track
and
the
of
heaven
were
flung
wide
wet
and
weary
they
battled
on
thinking
sometimes
of
the
cosy
parlor
behind
sometimes
of
the
home
in
front
wondering
whether
maggie
in
flat
contradiction
of
her
father
orders
would
be
up
to
welcome
them
or
whether
only
owd
bob
would
come
out
to
meet
them
the
wind
volleyed
past
them
like
salvoes
of
artillery
the
rain
stormed
at
them
from
above
spat
at
them
from
the
and
leapt
up
at
them
from
their
feet
once
they
halted
for
a
moment
finding
a
miserable
shelter
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
it
a
black
killer
night
panted
the
master
i
he
ay
the
boy
gasped
he
up
and
up
they
climbed
through
the
blackness
blind
and
buffeted
the
eternal
thunder
of
the
rain
was
all
about
them
the
clamor
of
the
gale
above
and
far
beneath
the
roar
of
angry
waters
once
in
a
lull
in
the
storm
the
master
turned
and
looked
back
into
the
blackness
along
the
path
they
had
come
did
ye
hear
onythin
he
roared
above
the
muffled
soughing
of
the
wind
nay
andrew
shouted
back
i
thowt
i
heard
a
step
the
master
cried
peering
down
but
nothing
could
he
see
then
the
wind
leaped
to
life
again
like
a
giant
from
his
sleep
drowning
all
sound
with
its
hurricane
voice
and
they
turned
and
bent
to
their
task
again
nearing
the
summit
the
master
turned
once
more
there
it
was
again
he
called
but
his
words
were
swept
away
on
the
storm
and
they
buckled
to
the
struggle
afresh
ever
and
anon
the
moon
gleamed
down
through
the
riot
of
tossing
sky
then
they
could
see
the
wet
wall
above
them
with
the
water
tumbling
down
its
sheer
face
and
far
below
in
the
roaring
gutter
of
the
pass
a
torrent
hardly
however
had
they
time
to
glance
around
when
a
mass
of
cloud
would
hurry
jealously
up
and
all
again
was
blackness
and
noise
at
length
nigh
spent
they
topped
the
last
and
steepest
pitch
of
the
pass
and
emerged
into
the
devil
bowl
there
overcome
with
their
exertions
they
flung
themselves
on
to
the
soaking
ground
to
draw
breath
behind
them
the
wind
rushed
with
a
sullen
roar
up
the
funnel
of
the
pass
it
screamed
above
them
as
though
ten
million
devils
were
and
blurted
out
on
to
the
wild
marches
beyond
as
they
lay
there
still
panting
the
moon
gleamed
down
in
momentary
graciousness
in
front
through
the
lashing
rain
they
could
discern
the
hillocks
that
squat
round
the
devil
bowl
and
lying
in
its
bosom
its
white
waters
usually
so
still
ploughed
now
into
a
thousand
furrows
the
lone
tarn
the
master
raised
his
head
and
craned
forward
at
the
ghostly
scene
of
a
sudden
he
reared
himself
on
to
his
arms
and
stayed
motionless
awhile
then
he
dropped
as
though
dead
forcing
down
andrew
with
an
iron
hand
lad
see
he
whispered
nay
what
the
boy
replied
roused
by
his
father
tone
there
but
as
the
master
pointed
forward
a
blur
of
cloud
intervened
and
all
was
dark
quickly
it
passed
and
again
the
lantern
of
the
night
shone
down
and
andrew
looking
with
all
his
eyes
saw
indeed
there
in
front
by
the
fretting
waters
of
the
tarn
packed
in
a
solid
phalanx
with
every
head
turned
in
the
same
direction
was
a
flock
of
sheep
they
were
motionless
staring
with
eyes
a
column
of
steam
rose
from
their
bodies
into
the
air
panting
and
palpitating
yet
they
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
water
as
though
determined
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
beyond
them
not
fifty
yards
away
crouched
a
humpbacked
boulder
casting
a
long
misshapen
shadow
in
the
moonlight
and
beneath
it
were
two
black
objects
one
still
struggling
feebly
the
killer
gasped
the
boy
and
all
ablaze
with
excitement
began
forging
forward
steady
lad
steady
urged
his
father
dropping
a
restraining
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
above
them
a
huddle
of
clouds
flung
in
furious
rout
across
the
night
and
the
moon
was
veiled
follow
lad
ordered
the
master
and
began
to
crawl
silently
forward
as
stealthily
andrew
pursued
and
over
the
sodden
ground
they
crept
one
behind
the
other
like
two
on
some
foul
errand
on
they
crawled
lying
prone
during
the
blinks
of
moon
stealing
forward
in
the
dark
till
at
length
the
swish
of
the
rain
on
the
waters
of
the
tarn
and
the
sobbing
of
the
flock
in
front
warned
them
they
were
near
they
skirted
the
trembling
pack
passing
so
close
as
to
brush
against
the
flanking
sheep
and
yet
unnoticed
for
the
sheep
were
in
the
tragedy
in
front
only
when
the
moon
was
in
andrew
could
hear
them
huddling
and
stamping
in
the
darkness
and
again
as
it
shone
out
fearfully
they
edged
closer
to
watch
the
bloody
play
along
the
tarn
edge
the
two
crept
and
still
the
gracious
moon
hid
their
approach
and
the
drunken
wind
drowned
with
its
revelry
the
sound
of
their
coming
so
they
stole
on
on
hands
and
knees
with
hearts
aghast
and
fluttering
breath
until
of
a
sudden
in
a
lull
of
wind
they
could
hear
right
before
them
the
smack
and
slobber
of
bloody
lips
chewing
their
bloody
meal
say
thy
prayers
red
wull
thy
last
minute
come
muttered
the
master
rising
to
his
knees
then
in
andrew
ear
when
i
rush
lad
follow
for
he
thought
when
the
moon
rose
to
jump
in
on
the
great
dog
and
surprising
him
as
he
lay
gorged
and
unsuspicious
to
deal
him
one
terrible
swashing
blow
and
end
forever
the
lawless
doings
of
the
tailless
tyke
the
moon
flung
off
its
veil
of
cloud
white
and
cold
it
stared
down
into
the
devil
bowl
on
murderer
and
murdered
within
a
hand
cast
of
the
avengers
of
blood
humped
the
black
boulder
on
the
border
of
its
shadow
lay
a
dead
sheep
and
standing
beside
the
body
his
coat
all
ruffled
by
the
hand
of

the

gleamed
down
on
the
dark
head
and
rough
gray
coat
and
lit
the
white
escutcheon
on
his
chest
and
in
the
darkness
james
moore
was
lying
with
his
face
pressed
downward
that
he
might
not
see
once
he
raised
himself
on
his
arms
his
eyes
were
shut
and
face
uplifted
like
a
blind
man
praying
he
passed
a
weary
hand
across
his
brow
his
head
dropped
again
and
he
moaned
and
moaned
like
a
man
in
everlasting
pain
then
the
darkness
lifted
a
moment
and
he
stole
a
furtive
glance
like
a
murderer
at
the
at
the
scene
in
front
it
was
no
dream
clear
and
cruel
in
the
moonlight
the
humpbacked
boulder
the
dead
sheep
and
that
gray
figure
beautiful
motionless
damned
for
all
eternity
the
master
turned
his
face
and
looked
at
andrew
a
dumb
pitiful
entreaty
in
his
eyes
but
in
the
boy
white
countenance
was
no
comfort
then
his
head
lolled
down
again
and
the
strong
man
was
whimpering
he
he
he
ma
laffin
moore
he
he
he
a
little
man
all
wet
and
shrunk
sat
hunching
on
a
mound
above
them
rocking
his
shrivelled
form
to
and
fro
in
the
agony
of
his
merriment
ye
raskil
he
he
ye
rogue
he
he
and
he
shook
his
fist
waggishly
at
the
unconscious
gray
dog
i
owe
ye
anither
grudge
for
this
anteecipated
me
and
he
leant
back
and
shook
this
way
and
that
in
convulsive
mirth
the
man
below
him
rose
heavily
to
his
feet
and
tumbled
toward
the
mocker
his
great
figure
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
though
in
blind
delirium
moaning
still
as
he
went
and
there
was
that
on
his
face
which
no
man
can
mistake
boy
that
he
was
andrew
knew
it
feyther
feyther
not
he
pleaded
running
after
his
father
and
laying
impotent
hands
on
him
but
the
strong
man
shook
him
off
like
a
fly
and
rolled
on
swaying
and
groaning
with
that
awful
expression
plain
to
see
in
the
moonlight
in
front
the
little
man
squatted
in
the
rain
bowed
double
still
and
took
no
thought
to
flee
come
on
james
moore
come
on
he
laughed
malignant
joy
in
his
voice
and
something
gleamed
bright
in
his
right
hand
and
was
hid
again
bin
waitin
this
a
weary
while
noo
come
on
then
had
there
been
done
something
worse
than
in
the
dreadful
lonesomeness
of
the
devil
bowl
upon
that
night
but
of
a
sudden
there
sounded
the
splash
of
a
man
foot
falling
heavily
behind
a
hand
like
a
falling
tree
smote
the
master
on
the
shoulder
and
a
voice
roared
above
the
noise
of
the
storm
mr
moore
look
man
look
the
master
tried
to
shake
off
that
detaining
grasp
but
it
pinned
him
where
he
was
immovable
look
i
tell
yo
cried
that
great
voice
again
a
hand
pushed
past
him
and
pointed
and
sullenly
he
turned
ignoring
the
figure
at
his
side
and
looked
the
wind
had
dropped
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
the
little
man
on
the
mound
had
ceased
to
chuckle
andrew
sobs
were
hushed
and
in
the
background
the
huddled
flock
edged
closer
the
world
hung
balanced
on
the
pinpoint
of
the
moment
every
eye
was
in
the
one
direction
with
dull
uncomprehending
gaze
james
moore
stared
as
bidden
there
was
the
gray
dog
naked
in
the
moonlight
heedless
still
of
any
witnesses
there
the
murdered
sheep
lying
within
and
without
that
distorted
shade
and
there
the
humpbacked
boulder
he
stared
into
the
shadow
and
still
stared
then
he
started
as
though
struck
the
shadow
of
the
boulder
had
moved
motionless
with
head
shot
forward
and
bulging
eyes
he
gazed
ay
ay
ay
he
was
sure
of
it
a
huge
dim
outline
as
of
a
lion
in
the
very
thickest
of
the
blackness
at
that
he
was
seized
with
such
a
palsy
of
trembling
that
he
must
have
fallen
but
for
the
strong
arm
about
his
waist
clearer
every
moment
grew
that
crouching
figure
till
at
length
they
plainly
could
discern
the
line
of
arching
loins
the
crest
thick
as
a
stallion
the
massive
wagging
head
no
mistake
this
time
there
he
lay
in
the
deepest
black
gigantic
revelling
in
his
horrid
debauch
the
black
killer
and
they
watched
him
at
his
feast
now
he
burrowed
into
the
spongy
flesh
now
turned
to
lap
the
dark
pool
which
glittered
in
the
moonlight
at
his
side
like
claret
in
a
silver
cup
now
lifting
his
head
he
snapped
irritably
at
the
and
the
moon
caught
his
wicked
rolling
eye
and
the
red
shreds
of
flesh
dripping
from
his
jaw
and
again
raising
his
great
muzzle
as
if
about
to
howl
he
let
the
delicious
nectar
trickle
down
his
throat
and
ravish
his
palate
so
he
went
on
all
unsuspicious
wisely
nodding
in
gluttony
and
in
the
stillness
between
the
claps
of
wind
they
could
hear
the
smacking
of
his
lips
while
all
the
time
the
gray
dog
stood
before
him
motionless
as
though
carved
in
stone
at
last
as
the
murderer
rolled
his
great
head
from
side
to
side
he
saw
that
still
figure
at
the
sight
he
leaped
back
dismayed
then
with
a
roar
that
shook
the
waters
of
the
tarn
he
was
up
and
across
his
victim
with
fangs
bared
his
coat
standing
erect
in
wet
rigid
furrows
from
topknot
to
tail
so
the
two
stood
face
to
face
with
perhaps
a
yard
of
air
between
them
the
wind
hushed
its
sighing
to
listen
the
moon
stared
down
white
and
dumb
away
at
the
back
the
sheep
edged
closer
while
save
for
the
everlasting
thunder
of
the
rain
there
was
utter
stillness
an
age
it
seemed
they
waited
so
then
a
voice
clear
yet
low
and
far
away
like
a
bugle
in
a
distant
city
broke
the
silence
eh
wullie
it
said
there
was
no
anger
in
the
tones
only
an
incomparable
reproach
the
sound
of
the
cracking
of
a
man
heart
at
the
call
the
great
dog
leapt
round
snarling
in
hideous
passion
he
saw
the
small
familiar
figure
against
the
tumbling
sky
and
for
the
only
time
in
his
life
red
wull
was
afraid
his
was
forgotten
the
dead
sheep
was
forgotten
everything
was
sunk
in
the
agony
of
that
moment
he
cowered
upon
the
ground
and
a
cry
like
that
of
a
lost
soul
was
wrung
from
him
it
rose
on
the
still
night
air
and
floated
wailing
away
and
the
white
waters
of
the
tarn
thrilled
in
cold
pity
out
of
the
lonely
hollow
over
the
desolate
marches
into
the
night
on
the
mound
above
stood
his
master
the
little
man
white
hair
was
bared
to
the
night
wind
the
rain
trickled
down
his
face
and
his
hands
were
folded
behind
his
back
he
stood
there
looking
down
into
the
dell
below
him
as
a
man
may
stand
at
the
tomb
of
his
lately
buried
wife
and
there
was
such
an
expression
on
his
face
as
i
can
not
describe
wullie
wullie
to
me
he
cried
at
length
and
his
voice
sounded
weak
and
far
like
a
distant
memory
at
that
the
huge
brute
came
crawling
toward
him
on
his
belly
whimpering
as
he
came
very
pitiful
in
his
distress
he
knew
his
fate
as
every
knows
it
that
troubled
him
not
his
pain
insufferable
was
that
this
his
friend
and
father
who
had
trusted
him
should
have
found
him
in
his
sin
so
he
crept
up
to
his
master
feet
and
the
little
man
never
moved
wullie
ma
wullie
he
said
very
gently
they
aye
bin
agin
me
and
noo
you
a
man
mither
a
man
wife
a
man
dog
they
all
iver
had
and
noo
ain
o
they
three
has
turned
agin
me
indeed
i
am
alone
at
that
the
great
dog
raised
himself
and
placing
his
forepaws
on
his
master
chest
tenderly
lest
he
should
hurt
him
who
was
already
hurt
past
healing
stood
towering
above
him
while
the
little
man
laid
his
two
colds
hands
on
the
dog
shoulders
so
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
like
a
man
and
his
love
at
word
owd
bob
looked
up
and
for
the
first
time
saw
his
master
he
seemed
in
nowise
startled
but
trotted
over
to
him
there
was
nothing
fearful
in
his
carriage
no
haunting
in
the
true
gray
eyes
which
never
told
a
lie
which
never
failed
to
look
you
in
the
face
yet
his
tail
was
low
and
as
he
stopped
at
his
feet
he
was
quivering
for
he
too
knew
and
was
not
unmoved
for
weeks
he
had
tracked
the
killer
for
weeks
he
had
followed
him
as
he
crossed
kenmuir
bound
on
his
bloody
errands
yet
always
had
lost
him
on
the
marches
now
at
last
he
had
run
him
to
ground
yet
his
heart
went
out
to
his
enemy
in
his
distress
i
thowt
been
yo
lad
the
master
whispered
his
hand
on
the
dark
head
at
his
knee
i
thowt
bin
yo
rooted
to
the
ground
the
three
watched
the
scene
between
and
his
wull
in
the
end
the
master
was
whimpering
andrew
crying
and
david
turned
his
back
at
length
silent
they
moved
away
had
i
should
i
go
to
him
asked
david
hoarsely
nodding
toward
his
father
nay
nay
lad
the
master
replied
yon
not
a
matter
for
a
so
they
marched
out
of
the
devil
bowl
and
left
those
two
alone
together
a
little
later
as
they
trampled
along
james
moore
heard
little
pattering
staggering
footsteps
behind
he
stopped
and
the
other
two
went
on
man
a
voice
whispered
and
a
face
white
and
pitiful
like
a
pleading
for
her
child
looked
into
his
man
ye
no
tell
them
a
no
like
to
ken
was
ma
wullie
think
an
had

answered
thickly
the
little
man
stretched
out
a
palsied
hand
gie
us
yer
hand
o
and
bless
ye
james
moore
so
these
two
shook
hands
in
the
moonlight
with
none
to
witness
it
but
the
god
who
made
them
and
that
is
why
the
mystery
of
the
black
killer
is
yet
unsolved
in
the
daleland
many
have
surmised
besides
those
three
only
one
other
knows
knows
now
which
of
those
two
he
saw
upon
a
summer
night
was
the
guilty
which
the
innocent

postie
jim

chapter
xxx
the
tailless
tyke
at
bay
on
the
following
morning
there
was
a
at
the
daughter
early
as
many
of
the
farmers
arrived
there
was
one
earlier
tupper
the
first
man
to
enter
the
parlor
found
before
him
he
was
sitting
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
his
thin
hands
rested
on
his
knees
and
on
his
face
was
a
gentle
dreamy
expression
such
as
no
man
had
ever
seen
there
before
all
the
harsh
wrinkles
seemed
to
have
fled
in
the
night
and
the
sour
face
stamped
deep
with
the
bitterness
of
life
was
softened
now
as
if
at
length
at
peace
when
i
coom
doon
this
mornin
said
teddy
bolstock
in
a
whisper
i
found
sittin
just
so
and
he
nor
moved
nor
spoke
where
th
terror
then
asked
tupper
awed
somehow
into
like
hushed
tones
in
t
paddock
at
back
teddy
answered
marchin
hoop
and
doon
hoop
and
doon
for
a
the
world
like
a
and
so
he
was
when
i
looked
oot
o
window
when
i
then
londesley
entered
and
after
him
ned
hoppin
rob
saunderson
jim
mason
and
others
each
with
his
dog
and
each
man
as
he
came
in
and
saw
the
little
lone
figure
for
once
without
its
huge
attendant
genius
put
the
same
question
while
the
dogs
sniffed
about
the
little
man
as
though
suspecting
treachery
and
all
the
time
sat
as
though
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
lost
in
some
sweet
sad
dream
so
quite
so
silent
that
more
than
one
thought
he
slept
after
the
first
glance
however
the
farmers
paid
him
little
heed
clustering
round
the
publican
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
to
hear
the
latest
story
of
owd
bob
it
appeared
that
a
week
previously
james
moore
with
a
pack
of
sheep
had
met
the
new
butcher
at
the
dalesmen
daughter
a
bargain
concluded
the
butcher
started
with
the
flock
for
home
as
he
had
no
dog
the
master
offered
him
th
owd
un
and
he
pick
me
i
th
town
said
he
now
the
butcher
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
of
course
he
had
heard
of
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
yet
it
never
struck
him
that
this
handsome
gentleman
with
the
quiet
resolute
manner
who
handled
sheep
as
he
had
never
seen
them
handled
was
that
hero
the
best
in
the
certain
it
is
that
by
the
time
the
flock
was
penned
in
the
enclosure
behind
the
shop
he
coveted
the
dog
ay
would
even
offer
ten
pounds
for
him
forthwith
the
butcher
locked
him
up
in
an
outhouse
summit
of
indignity
resolving
to
make
his
offer
on
the
morrow
when
the
morrow
came
he
found
no
dog
in
the
outhouse
and
worse
no
sheep
in
the
enclosure
a
sprung
board
showed
the
way
of
escape
of
the
one
and
a
displaced
hurdle
that
of
the
other
and
as
he
was
making
the
discovery
a
gray
dog
and
a
flock
of
sheep
travelling
along
the
road
toward
the
dalesman
daughter
met
the
master
from
the
first
owd
bob
had
mistrusted
the
man
the
attempt
to
confine
him
set
the
seal
on
his
suspicions
his
master
sheep
were
not
for
such
a
rogue
and
he
worked
his
own
way
out
and
took
the
sheep
along
with
him
the
story
was
told
to
a
running
chorus
of
ma
word
good
owd
un
ho
ho
did
he
thot
of
them
all
only
sat
strangely
silent
rob
saunderson
always
glad
to
draw
the
little
man
remarked
it
and
what
think
o
that
for
a
wunnerfu
story
of
a
wunnerfu
tyke
he
asked
it
a
gude
tale
a
vera
gude
tale
the
little
man
answered
dreamily
and
james
moore
didna
invent
it
he
had
it
from
the
christmas
number
o
the
in
on
the
following
sunday
old
rob
from
sheer
curiosity
reached
down
from
his
shelf
the
specified
number
of
the
paper
to
his
amazement
he
found
the
little
man
was
right
there
was
the
story
almost
identically
none
the
less
is
it
also
true
of
owd
bob
kenmuir
ay
ay
the
little
man
continued
and
in
a
day

teddy
bolstock
interrupted
lifting
his
hand
for
silence
hear
thot
thunder
they
listened
and
from
without
came
a
gurgling
jarring
roar
horrible
to
hear
it
comin
nearer
nay
it
goin
away
no
thunder
thot
more
like
the
lea
in

and
yet
eh

the
little
man

on
his
feet
staring
about
him
where
yer
dogs
he
almost
screamed
here
ma
nay
by
thunder
but

not
was
the
astonished
cry
in
the
interest
of
the
story
no
man
had
noticed
that
his
dog
had
risen
from
his
side
no
one
had
noticed
a
file
of
shaggy
figures
creeping
out
of

there

for

each

and
rushed
for

and
led

a
rare
thing
it

saunderson
old
shep
walked
quietly
to
the
back
door
of
the
house
and
looked
out
there
on
the
slope
below
him
he
saw
what
he
sought
stalking
up
and
down
gaunt
and
grim
like
a
lion
at
and
as
the
old
dog
watched
his
tail
was
gently
swaying
as
though
he
were
well
pleased
he
walked
back
into
the
just
as
teddy
began
his
tale
twice
he
made
the
round
of
the
room
from
dog
to
dog
he
went
stopping
at
each
as
though
urging
him
on
to
some
great
enterprise
then
he
made
for
the
door
again
looking
back
to
see
if
any
followed
one
by
one
the
others
rose
and
trailed
out
after
him
big
blue
rasper
londesley
lassie
ned
hoppin
young
dog
grip
and
grapple
the
publican
jim
mason
gyp
foolish
and
flirting
even
now
others
there
were
and
last
of
all
waddling
heavily
in
the
rear
that
scarred
amazon
the
venus
out
of
the
house
they
pattered
silent
and
unseen
with
murder
in
their
hearts
at
last
they
had
found
their
enemy
alone
and
slowly
in
a
black
cloud
like
the
shadow
of
death
they
dropped
down
the
slope
upon
him
and
he
saw
them
coming
knew
their
errand
as
who
should
better
than
the
terror
of
the
border
and
was
glad
death
it
might
be
and
such
an
one
as
he
would
wish
to
die
at
least
distraction
from
that
haunting
pain
and
he
smiled
grimly
as
he
looked
at
the
approaching
crowd
and
saw
there
was
not
one
there
but
he
had
humbled
in
his
time
he
ceased
his
restless
pacing
and
awaited
them
his
great
head
was
high
as
he
scanned
them
contemptuously
daring
them
to
come
on
and
on
they
came
marching
slow
and
silent
like
soldiers
at
a
funeral
young
and
old
and
bull
terrier
and
collie
flocking
like
vultures
to
the
dead
and
the
venus
heavy
with
years
rolled
after
them
on
her
bandy
legs
panting
in
her
hurry
lest
she
should
be
late
for
had
she
not
the
blood
of
her
blood
to
avenge
so
they
came
about
him
slow
certain
murderous
opening
out
to
cut
him
off
on
every
side
there
was
no
need
he
never
thought
to
move
long
odds
be
crushingly
heavy
yet
he
loved
them
for
it
and
was
trembling
already
with
the
glory
of
the
coming
fight
they
were
up
to
him
now
the
walking
round
him
on
their
toes
stiff
and
short
like
cats
on
coals
their
hacks
a
little
humped
heads
averted
yet
eying
him
askance
and
he
remained
nor
looked
at
them
his
great
chin
was
cocked
and
his
muzzle
wrinkled
in
a
dreadful
grin
as
he
stood
there
shivering
a
little
his
eyes
rolling
back
his
breath
grating
in
his
throat
to
set
every
bristle
on
end
he
looked
a
devil
indeed
the
venus
ranged
alongside
him
no
preliminary
stage
for
her
she
never
walked
where
she
could
stand
or
stood
where
she
could
lie
but
stand
she
must
now
breathing
hard
through
her
nose
never
taking
her
eyes
off
that
pad
she
had
marked
for
her
own
close
beside
her
were
grip
and
grapple
looking
up
at
the
line
above
them
where
hairy
neck
and
shoulder
joined
behind
was
big
rasper
and
close
to
him
lassie
of
the
others
each
had
marked
his
place
each
taken
up
his
post
last
of
all
old
shep
took
his
stand
full
in
front
of
his
enemy
their
shoulders
almost
rubbing
head
past
head
so
the
two
stood
a
moment
as
though
they
were
whispering
each
diabolical
each
rolling
back
his
eyes
to
watch
the
other
while
from
the
little
mob
there
rose
a
snarling
bubbling
snore
like
some
giant
wheezing
in
his
sleep
then
like
lightning
each
struck
rearing
high
they
wrestled
with
striving
paws
and
the
expression
of
fiends
incarnate
down
they
went
shep
underneath
and
the
great
dog
with
a
dozen
of
these
wolves
of
hell
upon
him
rasper
devilish
was
riding
on
his
back
the
venus
well
for
him
had
struck
and
missed
but
grip
and
grapple
had
their
hold
and
the
others
like
leaping
demoniacs
were
plunging
into
the
whirlpool
vortex
of
the
fight
and
there
where
a
fortnight
before
he
had
fought
and
lost
the
battle
of
the
cup
red
wull
now
battled
for
his
life
long
odds
but
what
cared
he
the
agony
of
the
night
was
drowned
in
that
glorious
delirium
the
hate
of
years
came
bubbling
forth
in
that
supreme
moment
he
would
avenge
his
wrongs
and
he
went
in
to
fight
revelling
like
a
giant
in
the
red
lust
of
killing
long
odds
never
before
had
he
faced
such
a
galaxy
of
foes
his
one
chance
lay
in
quickness
to
prevent
the
swarming
crew
getting
their
hold
till
at
least
he
had
diminished
their
numbers
then
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
great
brute
huge
as
a
strong
as
a
bull
rolling
over
and
over
and
up
again
quick
as
a
kitten
leaping
here
striking
there
shaking
himself
free
swinging
his
quarters
fighting
with
feet
and
body
and
teeth
every
inch
of
him
at
war
more
than
once
he
broke
right
through
the
mob
only
to
turn
again
and
face
it
no
flight
for
him
nor
thought
of
it
up
and
down
the
slope
the
dark
mass
tossed
like
some
hulk
the
sport
of
the
waves
black
and
white
sable
and
gray
worrying
at
that
great
up
and
down
roaming
wide
leaving
everywhere
a
trail
of
red
gyp
he
had
pinned
and
hurled
over
his
shoulder
grip
followed
he
shook
her
till
she
rattled
then
flung
her
afar
and
she
fell
with
a
horrid
thud
not
to
rise
while
grapple
the
death
to
avenge
hung
tighter
in
a
scarlet
soaking
patch
of
the
ground
lay
big
bell
lurcher
doubled
up
in
a
dreadful
ball
and
hoppin
young
dog
who
three
hours
before
had
been
the
children
tender
playmate
now
fiendish
to
look
on
dragged
after
the
huddle
up
the
hill
back
the
mob
rolled
on
her
when
it
was
passed
she
lay
quite
still
grinning
a
handful
of
tawny
hair
and
flesh
in
her
dead
mouth
so
they
fought
on
and
ever
and
anon
a
great
figure
rose
up
from
the
heaving
inferno
all
around
rearing
to
his
full
height
his
head
ragged
and
bleeding
the
red
foam
dripping
from
his
jaws
thus
he
would
appear
momentarily
like
some
dark
rock
amid
a
raging
sea
and
down
he
would
go
again
silent
now
they
fought
dumb
and
determined
only
you
might
have
heard
the
rend
and
rip
of
tearing
flesh
a
hoarse
gurgle
as
some
dog
went
down
the
panting
of
dry
throats
and
now
and
then
a
sob
from
that
central
figure
for
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
the
terror
of
the
border
was
at
bay
all
who
meant
it
were
on
him
now
the
venus
blinded
with
blood
had
her
hold
at
last
and
never
but
once
in
a
long
life
of
battles
had
she
let
go
rasper
his
breath
coming
in
rattles
had
him
horribly
by
the
loins
while
a
dozen
other
devils
with
red
eyes
and
wrinkled
nostrils
clung
still
long
odds
and
down
he
went
smothered
beneath
the
weight
of
numbers
yet
struggled
up
again
his
great
head
was
torn
and
dripping
his
eyes
a
gleam
of
rolling
red
and
white
the
little
tail
stern
and
stiff
like
the
gallant
stump
of
a
flagstaff
shot
away
he
was
desperate
but
indomitable
and
he
sobbed
as
he
fought
doggedly
on
long
odds
it
could
not
last
and
down
he
went
at
length
silent
still
never
a
cry
should
they
wring
from
him
in
his
agony
the
venus
glued
to
that
mangled
pad
rasper
beneath
him
now
three
at
his
throat
two
at
his
ears
a
crowd
on
flanks
and
body
the
terror
of
the
border
was
down
at
last
wullie
ma
wullie
screamed
bounding
down
the
slope
a
length
in
front
of
the
rest
wullie
wullie
to
me
at
the
shrill
cry
the
huddle
below
was
convulsed
it
heaved
and
swelled
and
dragged
to
and
fro
like
the
sea
lashed
into
life
by
some
dying
leviathan
a
gigantic
figure
tawny
and
red
fought
its
way
to
the
surface
a
great
tossing
head
bloody
past
recognition
flung
out
from
the
ruck
one
quick
glance
he
shot
from
his
ragged
eyes
at
the
little
flying
form
in
front
then
with
a
roar
like
a
waterfall
plunged
toward
it
shaking
off
the
bloody
leeches
as
he
went
wullie
wullie
i
wi
ye
cried
that
little
voice
now
so
near
through
through
through
an
incomparable
effort
and
his
last
they
hung
to
his
throat
they
clung
to
his
muzzle
they
were
round
and
about
him
and
down
he
went
again
with
a
sob
and
a
little
suffocating
cry
shooting
up
at
his
master
one
quick
beseeching
glance
as
the
sea
of
blood
closed
over
him
worrying
smothering
tearing
like
foxhounds
at
the
kill
they
left
the
dead
and
pulled
away
the
living
and
it
was
no
light
task
for
the
pack
were
mad
for
blood
at
the
bottom
of
the
wet
mess
of
hair
and
red
and
flesh
was
old
shep
and
as
saunderson
pulled
the
body
out
his
face
was
working
for
no
man
can
lose
in
a
crack
the
friend
of
a
dozen
years
and
remain
unmoved
the
venus
lay
there
her
teeth
clenched
still
in
death
smiling
that
her
vengeance
was
achieved
big
rasper
blue
no
longer
was
gasping
out
his
life
two
more
came
crawling
out
to
find
a
quiet
spot
where
they
might
lay
them
down
to
die
before
the
night
had
fallen
another
had
gone
to
his
account
while
not
a
dog
who
fought
upon
that
day
but
carried
the
scars
of
it
with
him
to
his
grave
the
terror
o
th
border
terrible
in
his
life
like
samson
was
yet
more
terrible
in
his
dying
down
at
the
bottom
lay
that
which
once
had
been
adam
red
wull
at
the
sight
the
little
man
neither
raved
nor
swore
it
was
past
that
for
him
he
sat
down
heedless
of
the
soaking
ground
and
took
the
mangled
head
in
his
lap
very
tenderly
they
done
ye
at
last
wullie
they
done
ye
at
last
he
said
quietly
unalterably
convinced
that
the
attack
had
been
organized
while
he
was
detained
in
the
on
hearing
the
loved
little
voice
the
dog
gave
one
weary
wag
of
his
and
with
that
the
tailless
tyke
adam
red
wull
the
black
killer
went
to
his
long
home
one
by
one
the
dalesmen
took
away
their
dead
and
the
little
man
was
left
alone
with
the
body
of
his
last
friend
he
sat
there
nursing
the
dead
dog
head
hour
after
hour
alone
crooning
to
himself
a
sair

he
went
on
repeating
the
lines
over
and
over
again
always
with
the
same
sad
termination
a
man
mither
a
man
wife

he
sat
there
muttering
and
stroking
the
poor
head
upon
his
lap
bending
over
it
like
a
mother
over
a
sick
child
they

he
bent
down
and
whispered
i
dreamed
sic
an
awfu
thing
that
ma
wullie
but
there
was
but
a
so
he
sat
on
crooning
to
the
dead
dog
and
no
man
approached
him
only
bessie
of
the
inn
watched
the
little
lone
figure
from
afar
it
was
long
past
noon
when
at
length
he
rose
laying
the
dog
head
reverently
down
and
tottered
away
toward
that
bridge
which
once
the
dead
thing
on
the
slope
had
held
against
a
thousand
he
crossed
it
and
turned
there
was
a
look
upon
his
face
half
hopeful
half
fearful
very
piteous
to
see
wullie
wullie
to
me
he
cried
only
the
accents
formerly
so
fiery
were
now
weak
as
a
dying
man
a
while
he
waited
in
vain
are
ye
no
comin
wullie
he
asked
at
length
in
quavering
tones
ye
not
used
to
leave
he
walked
away
a
pace
then
turned
again
and
whistled
that
shrill
sharp
call
only
now
it
sounded
like
a
broken
echo
of
itself
come
to
me
wullie
he
implored
very
pitifully
is
the
first
time
iver
i
kent
ye
not
come
and
me
whistlin
what
ails
ye
lad
he
recrossed
the
bridge
walking
blindly
like
a
sobbing
child
and
yet
over
the
dead
body
he
stooped
what
ails
ye
wullie
he
asked
again
will
you
too
leave
me
then
bessie
watching
fearfully
saw
him
bend
sling
the
great
body
on
his
back
and
stagger
away
limp
and
hideous
the
carcase
hung
down
from
the
little
man
shoulders
the
huge
head
with
grim
wide
eyes
and
lolling
tongue
jolted
and
swagged
with
the
motion
seeming
to
grin
a
ghastly
defiance
at
the
world
it
had
left
and
the
last
bessie
saw
of
them
was
that
bloody
rolling
head
with
the
puny
legs
staggering
beneath
their
load
as
the
two
passed
out
of
the
world
ken
in
the
devil
bowl
next
day
they
found
the
pair
adam
and
his
red
wull
face
to
face
dead
not
divided
each
save
for
the
other
alone
the
dog
his
saturnine
expression
glazed
and
ghastly
in
the
fixedness
of
death
propped
up
against
that
humpbacked
boulder
beneath
which
a
while
before
the
black
killer
had
dreed
his
weird
and
close
by
his
master
lying
on
his
back
his
dim
dead
eyes
staring
up
at
the
heaven
one
hand
still
clasping
a
crumpled
photograph
the
weary
body
at
rest
at
last
the
mocking
face
mocking
no
longer
alight
with
a
transfiguring
happiness
postscript
adam
and
his
red
wull
lie
buried
together
one
just
within
the
other
just
without
the
consecrated
pale
the
only
mourners
at
the
funeral
were
david
james
moore
maggie
and
a
gray
dog
peering
through
the
during
the
service
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
churchyard
and
a
lady
with
a
stately
figure
and
a
gentle
face
stepped
out
and
came
across
the
grass
to
pay
a
last
tribute
to
the
dead
and
lady
eleanour
as
she
joined
the
little
group
about
the
grave
seemed
to
notice
a
more
than
usual
solemnity
in
the
parson
voice
as
he
intoned
earth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
in
sure
and
certain
hope
of
the
resurrection
to
eternal
when
you
wander
in
the
gray
of
the
north
in
the
loneliest
corner
of
that
lonely
land
you
may
chance
upon
a
low
farmhouse
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
muir
pike
entering
a
tall
old
man
comes
out
to
greet
you
the
master
of
kenmuir
his
shoulders
are
bent
now
the
hair
that
was
so
dark
is
frosted
but
the
eyes
look
you
as
proudly
in
the
face
as
of
yore
and
while
the
girl
with
the
glory
of
yellow
hair
is
preparing
food
for
you
they
are
hospitable
to
a
fault
these
northerners
you
will
notice
on
the
mantelpiece
standing
solitary
a
massive
silver
cup
dented
that
is
the
shepherds
trophy
won
outright
as
the
old
man
will
tell
you
by
owd
bob
last
and
best
of
the
gray
dogs
of
kenmuir
the
last
because
he
is
the
best
because
once
for
a
unit
of
time
james
moore
had
thought
him
to
be
the
worst
when
at
length
you
take
your
leave
the
old
man
accompanies
you
to
the
top
of
the
slope
to
point
you
your
way
yo
cross
the
stream
over
langholm
how
yonder
past
the
bottom
and
oop
th
hill
on
far
side
yo
come
on
th
house
o
top
and
happen
yo
meet
th
owd
un
on
the
road
to
you
sir
so
you
go
as
he
has
bidden
you
across
the
stream
skirting
the
how
over
the
gulf
and
up
the
hill
again
on
the
way
as
the
master
has
foretold
you
come
upon
an
old
gray
dog
trotting
soberly
along
th
owd
un
indeed
seems
to
spend
the
evening
of
his
life
going
thus
between
kenmuir
and
the
grange
the
black
muzzle
is
almost
white
now
the
gait
formerly
so
smooth
and
strong
is
stiff
and
slow
venerable
indeed
is
he
of
whom
men
still
talk
as
the
best
in
the
north
as
he
passes
he
pauses
to
scan
you
the
noble
head
is
high
and
one
foot
raised
and
you
look
into
two
big
gray
eyes
such
as
you
have
never
seen
before
soft
a
little
dim
and
infinitely
sad
that
is
owd
bob
o
kenmuir
of
whom
the
tales
are
many
as
the
flowers
on
the
may
with
him
dies
the
last
of
the
immortal
line
of
the
gray
dogs
of
kenmuir
you
travel
on
up
the
bill
something
pensive
and
knock
at
the
door
of
the
house
on
the
top
a
woman
comely
with
the
inevitable
comeliness
of
motherhood
opens
to
you
and
nestling
in
her
arms
is
a
little
boy
with
golden
hair
and
happy
face
like
one
of
correggio
cherubs
you
ask
the
child
his
name
he
kicks
and
crows
and
looks
up
at
his
mother
and
in
the
end
lisps
roguishly
as
if
it
was
the
merriest
joke
in
all
this
merry
world
adum
