the
cardinal
by
henry
harland
i
the
signorino
will
take
coffee
old
marietta
asked
as
she
set
the
fruit
before
him
peter
deliberated
for
a
moment
then
burned
his
ships
yes
he
answered
but
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
little
brown
old
woman
suggested
with
a
persuasive
flourish
no
he
corrected
her
gently
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
not
perhaps
her
small
sharp
old
black
italian
eyes
twinkled
responsive
the
signorino
will
find
a
rustic
table
under
the
big
at
the
water
edge
she
informed
him
with
a
good
deal
of
gesture
shall
i
serve
it
there
where
you
will
i
leave
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
he
said
so
he
sat
by
the
rustic
table
on
a
rustic
bench
under
the
willow
sipped
his
coffee
smoked
his
cigarette
and
gazed
in
contemplation
at
the
view
of
its
kind
it
was
rather
a
striking
view
in
the
immediate
foreground
at
his
feet
indeed
there
was
the
river
the
narrow
aco
a
dark
file
of
poplars
on
either
bank
rushing
away
from
the
quiet
waters
of
the
lake
then
just
across
the
river
at
his
left
stretched
the
smooth
lawns
of
the
park
of
ventirose
with
glimpses
of
the
castle
through
the
trees
and
beyond
undulating
country
flourishing
friendly
a
perspective
of
vineyards
cornfields
groves
and
gardens
pointed
by
numberless
white
villas
at
his
right
loomed
the
gaunt
mass
of
the
gnisi
with
its
black
forests
its
bare
crags
its
foaming
ascade
and
the
crenelated
range
of
the
cornobastone
and
finally
climax
and
cynosure
at
the
end
monte
sfiorito
its
three
summits
almost
floating
forms
of
luminous
pink
vapour
in
the
evening
sunshine
against
the
intense
blue
of
the
sky
a
familiar
verse
had
come
into
peter
mind
and
kept
running
there
obstinately
really
he
said
to
himself
feature
for
feature
down
to
the
very
leaping
in
glory
the
scene
might
have
been
got
up
apres
coup
to
illustrate
and
he
began
to
repeat
the
beautiful
hackneyed
words
under
his
breath
but
about
midway
of
the
third
line
he
was
interrupted
ii
it
not
altogether
a
bad
sort
of
view
is
it
some
one
said
in
english
the
voice
was
a
woman
it
was
clear
and
smooth
it
was
distinguished
peter
glanced
about
him
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
aco
in
the
grounds
of
ventirose
five
or
six
yards
away
a
lady
was
standing
looking
at
him
smiling
peter
eyes
met
hers
took
in
her
face
and
suddenly
his
heart
gave
a
jump
then
it
stopped
dead
still
tingling
for
a
second
then
it
flew
off
racing
oh
for
reasons
for
the
best
reasons
in
the
world
but
thereby
hangs
my
tale
she
was
a
young
woman
tall
slender
in
a
white
frock
with
a
white
cloak
an
indescribable
complexity
of
soft
lace
and
airy
ruffles
round
her
shoulders
she
wore
no
hat
her
hair
brown
and
warm
in
shadow
sparkled
where
it
caught
the
light
in
a
kind
of
crinkly
iridescence
like
threads
of
glass
peter
heart
for
the
best
reasons
in
the
world
was
racing
perilously
it
impossible
impossible
impossible
the
words
strummed
themselves
to
its
rhythm
peter
wits
for
had
not
the
impossible
come
to
pass
were
in
a
perilous
confusion
but
he
managed
to
rise
from
his
rustic
bench
and
to
achieve
a
bow
she
inclined
her
head
graciously
you
do
not
think
it
altogether
bad
i
hope
she
questioned
in
her
voice
raising
her
eyebrows
slightly
with
a
droll
little
assumption
of
solicitude
peter
wits
were
in
confusion
but
he
must
answer
her
an
automatic
summoned
by
the
emergency
answered
for
him
i
think
one
might
safely
call
it
altogether
oh
she
exclaimed
her
eyebrows
went
up
again
but
now
they
expressed
a
certain
whimsical
surprise
she
threw
back
her
head
and
regarded
the
prospect
critically
it
is
not
then
too
spectacular
too
violent
she
wondered
returning
her
gaze
to
peter
with
an
air
of
polite
readiness
to
defer
to
his
opinion
not
too
much
like
a
decor
de
theatre
one
should
judge
it
his
automatic
submitted
with
some
leniency
it
is
after
all
only
unaided
a
spark
flickered
in
her
eyes
while
she
appeared
to
ponder
but
i
am
not
sure
whether
she
was
pondering
the
speech
or
its
speaker
really
she
said
in
the
end
did
did
nature
build
the
villas
and
plant
the
cornfields
but
his
automatic
was
on
its
mettle
yes
it
asserted
boldly
the
kind
of
men
who
build
villas
and
plant
cornfields
must
be
classified
as
natural
she
gave
a
light
little
laugh
and
again
appeared
to
ponder
for
a
moment
then
with
another
gracious
inclination
of
the
head
and
an
interrogative
brightening
of
the
eyes
mr
marchdale
no
doubt
she
hazarded
peter
bowed
i
am
very
glad
if
on
the
whole
you
like
our
little
effect
she
went
on
glancing
in
the
direction
of
monte
sfiorito
i
there
was
the
briefest
suspension
i
am
your
for
a
third
time
peter
bowed
a
rather
more
elaborate
bow
than
his
earlier
ones
a
bow
of
respectful
enlightenment
of
feudal
homage
you
arrived
this
afternoon
she
conjectured
by
the
from
bergamo
said
he
a
very
convenient
train
she
remarked
and
then
in
the
pleasantest
manner
whereby
the
unusual
mode
of
valediction
was
carried
off
good
good
evening
responded
peter
and
accomplished
his
fourth
bow
she
moved
away
from
the
river
up
the
smooth
lawns
between
the
trees
towards
castel
ventirose
a
flitting
whiteness
amid
the
surrounding
green
peter
stood
still
looking
after
her
but
when
she
was
out
of
sight
he
sank
back
upon
his
rustic
bench
like
a
man
exhausted
and
breathed
a
prodigious
sigh
he
was
absurdly
pale
all
the
same
clenching
his
fists
and
softly
pounding
the
table
with
them
he
muttered
exultantly
between
his
teeth
what
luck
what
incredible
luck
it
she
it
she
as
i
a
heathen
oh
what
supernatural
luck
iii
old
marietta
the
bravest
of
small
figures
in
her
neat
peasant
dress
with
her
silver
ornaments
and
her
red
silk
coif
and
apron
came
for
the
coffee
things
but
at
sight
of
peter
she
abruptly
halted
she
struck
an
attitude
of
alarm
she
fixed
him
with
her
fiery
little
black
eyes
the
signorino
is
not
well
she
cried
in
the
tones
of
one
launching
a
denunciation
peter
roused
himself
er
yes
i
pretty
well
thank
you
he
reassured
her
i
i
only
dying
he
added
sweetly
after
an
instant
hesitation
dying
echoed
marietta
wild
aghast
ah
but
you
can
save
my
life
you
come
in
the
very
nick
of
time
he
said
i
dying
of
curiosity
dying
to
know
something
that
you
can
tell
her
stare
dissolved
her
attitude
relaxed
she
smiled
relief
rebuke
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
ah
the
signorino
gave
me
a
fine
fright
she
said
a
thousand
regrets
said
peter
now
be
a
succouring
angel
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
who
is
my
landlady
marietta
drew
back
a
little
her
brown
old
visage
wrinkled
up
perplexed
who
is
the
signorino
landlady
she
repeated
ang
said
he
imitating
the
characteristic
nasalised
eh
of
italian
affirmation
and
accompanying
it
by
the
characteristic
italian
jerk
of
the
head
marietta
eyed
him
still
perplexed
even
one
might
have
fancied
a
bit
suspicious
but
is
it
not
in
the
signorino
lease
she
asked
with
caution
of
course
it
is
said
he
that
just
the
point
who
is
she
but
if
it
is
in
your
lease
she
expostulated
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
make
no
secret
of
it
he
argued
plausibly
come
out
with
it
who
is
my
landlady
marietta
exchanged
a
glance
with
heaven
the
signorino
landlady
is
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
she
answered
in
accents
of
resignation
but
then
the
name
seemed
to
stimulate
her
and
she
went
on
she
lives
there
at
castel
marietta
pointed
towards
the
castle
she
owns
all
all
this
country
all
these
houses
all
marietta
joined
her
brown
old
hands
together
and
separated
them
like
a
swimmer
in
a
gesture
that
swept
the
horizon
her
eyes
snapped
all
lombardy
said
peter
without
emotion
marietta
stared
again
all
lombardy
mache
was
her
scornful
remonstrance
nobody
owns
all
lombardy
all
these
lands
these
who
is
she
peter
asked
marietta
eyes
blinked
in
stupefaction
before
such
stupidity
but
i
have
just
told
you
she
cried
she
is
the
duchessa
di
who
is
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
he
asked
marietta
blinking
harder
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
she
raised
her
voice
screamed
almost
as
to
one
deaf
but
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
is
the
signorino
landlady
la
proprietaria
di
tutte
queste
terre
tutte
queste
case
tutte
and
she
twice
with
some
violence
reacted
her
comprehensive
gesture
like
a
swimmer
you
evade
me
by
a
vicious
circle
peter
murmured
marietta
made
a
mighty
all
her
faculties
to
a
focus
studied
peter
countenance
intently
her
own
was
suddenly
illumined
ah
i
understand
she
proclaimed
vigorously
nodding
the
signorino
desires
to
know
who
she
is
personally
i
express
myself
in
obscure
paraphrases
said
he
but
you
with
your
unfailing
italian
simpatia
have
divined
the
exact
shade
of
my
she
is
the
widow
of
the
duca
di
santangiolo
said
marietta
enfin
vous
entrez
dans
la
voie
des
aveux
said
peter
scusi
said
marietta
i
am
glad
to
hear
she
a
widow
said
he
she
she
might
strike
a
casual
observer
as
somewhat
young
for
a
she
is
not
very
old
agreed
marietta
only
she
was
married
from
the
convent
that
was
eight
nine
years
ago
the
duca
has
been
dead
five
or
and
was
he
also
young
and
lovely
peter
asked
young
and
lovely
mache
derided
marietta
he
was
past
forty
he
was
fat
but
he
was
a
good
so
much
the
better
for
him
now
said
peter
gia
approved
marietta
and
solemnly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
explain
to
me
the
young
man
continued
how
it
happens
that
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
speaks
english
as
well
as
i
do
the
old
woman
frowned
surprise
come
she
speaks
english
for
all
the
world
like
an
englishman
asseverated
peter
ah
well
marietta
reflected
she
was
english
you
oho
exclaimed
peter
she
was
english
was
she
he
bore
a
little
on
the
tense
of
the
verb
that
lets
in
a
flood
of
light
and
and
what
by
the
bye
is
she
now
he
questioned
ma
italian
naturally
since
she
married
the
duca
marietta
replied
indeed
then
the
leopard
can
change
his
spots
was
peter
inference
the
leopard
said
marietta
at
a
loss
if
the
devil
may
quote
scripture
for
his
purpose
why
may
i
peter
demanded
at
all
events
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
is
a
very
beautiful
the
signorino
has
seen
her
marietta
asked
i
have
grounds
for
believing
so
an
apparition
a
phantom
of
delight
appeared
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
tumultuous
aco
and
announced
herself
as
my
landlady
of
course
she
may
have
been
an
impostor
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
get
the
rent
a
tall
woman
in
white
with
hair
and
a
figure
and
a
voice
like
cooling
streams
and
an
eye
that
can
speak
volumes
with
a
marietta
nodded
recognition
that
would
be
the
she
a
very
beautiful
duchessa
reiterated
peter
marietta
was
italian
so
italian
wise
she
answered
we
are
all
as
god
makes
for
years
i
have
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
europe
peter
averred
marietta
opened
her
eyes
wide
for
years
the
signorino
knows
her
the
signorino
has
seen
her
before
a
phrase
came
back
to
him
from
a
novel
he
had
been
reading
that
afternoon
in
the
train
he
adapted
it
to
the
occasion
i
rather
think
she
is
my
brother
faltered
marietta
well
certainly
not
sister
said
peter
with
determination
you
have
my
permission
to
take
away
the
coffee
iv
up
at
the
castle
in
her
boudoir
beatrice
was
writing
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
england
villa
floriano
she
wrote
among
other
words
has
been
let
to
an
englishman
a
youngish
creature
in
a
dinner
jacket
with
a
tongue
in
his
head
and
an
indulgent
eye
for
nature
named
peter
marchdale
do
you
happen
by
any
chance
to
know
who
he
is
or
anything
about
him
v
peter
very
likely
slept
but
little
that
first
night
at
the
villa
and
more
than
once
i
fancy
he
repeated
to
his
pillow
his
pious
ejaculation
of
the
afternoon
what
luck
what
supernatural
luck
he
was
up
in
any
case
at
an
unconscionable
hour
next
morning
up
and
down
in
his
garden
it
really
is
a
surprisingly
jolly
garden
he
confessed
the
agent
was
guiltless
of
exaggeration
and
the
photographs
were
not
the
perjuries
one
there
were
some
fine
old
trees
lindens
acacias
chestnuts
a
lombardy
pine
a
darkling
ilex
besides
the
willow
that
overhung
the
river
and
the
poplars
that
stiffly
stood
along
its
border
then
there
was
the
river
itself
dancing
and
singing
as
it
sped
away
with
a
thousand
diamonds
flashing
on
its
surface
floating
sinking
rising
where
the
sun
caught
its
ripples
there
were
some
charming
bits
of
greensward
there
was
a
fountain
plashing
melodious
coolness
in
a
nimbus
of
spray
which
the
sun
touched
to
rainbow
pinks
and
yellows
there
were
vivid
parterres
of
flowers
begonia
and
geranium
there
were
oleanders
with
their
heady
southern
perfume
there
were
like
knots
of
scarlet
crepe
there
were
white
carnations
heliotrope
mignonette
there
were
endless
roses
and
there
were
birds
birds
birds
everywhere
you
heard
their
joyous
piping
the
busy
flutter
of
their
wings
there
were
goldfinches
blackbirds
thrushes
with
their
young
the
plumpest
clumsiest
little
blunderers
at
the
age
ingrat
just
beginning
to
fly
a
terrible
anxiety
to
their
parents
and
there
were
also
i
regret
to
own
a
good
many
rowdy
sparrows
there
were
bees
and
bumblebees
there
were
brilliant
dragonflies
there
were
butterflies
blue
ones
and
white
ones
fluttering
in
couples
there
were
also
i
am
afraid
a
good
many
gadflies
but
che
volete
who
minds
a
gadfly
or
two
in
italy
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
there
were
and
and
artichokes
holding
their
heads
high
in
rigid
rows
and
a
vine
heavy
with
great
clusters
of
yellow
grapes
was
festooned
upon
the
northern
wall
the
morning
air
was
ineffably
sweet
and
keen
penetrant
tonic
with
moist
racy
smells
the
smell
of
the
good
brown
earth
the
smell
of
green
things
and
growing
things
the
dew
was
spread
over
the
grass
like
a
veil
of
silver
gossamer
spangled
with
crystals
the
friendly
country
westward
vineyards
and
white
villas
laughed
in
the
sun
at
the
gnisi
sulking
black
in
shadow
to
the
east
the
lake
lay
deep
and
still
a
dark
sapphire
and
away
at
the
valley
end
monte
sfiorito
always
showed
pale
upon
a
sky
in
which
still
lingered
some
of
the
flush
of
dawn
it
was
a
surprisingly
jolly
garden
true
enough
but
though
peter
remained
in
it
all
day
long
though
he
haunted
the
riverside
and
cast
a
million
desirous
glances
between
the
trees
and
up
the
lawns
towards
castel
ventirose
he
enjoyed
no
briefest
vision
of
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
nor
the
next
day
nor
the
next
why
does
that
old
dowager
ever
come
down
and
look
after
her
river
he
asked
marietta
for
all
the
attention
she
gives
it
the
water
might
be
undermining
her
property
on
both
that
old
dowager
repeated
marietta
blank
that
old
widow
woman
my
landlady
the
duchessa
vedova
di
she
is
not
very
old
only
said
marietta
do
try
to
persuade
me
that
she
is
old
enough
to
know
better
retorted
peter
sternly
but
she
has
her
guards
her
keepers
to
look
after
her
property
said
marietta
guards
and
keepers
are
mere
mercenaries
if
you
want
a
thing
well
done
you
should
do
it
yourself
said
peter
with
gloomy
sententiousness
on
sunday
he
went
to
the
little
grey
rococo
parish
church
there
were
two
masses
one
at
eight
one
at
ten
and
the
church
was
quite
a
mile
from
villa
floriano
and
up
a
hill
and
the
italian
sun
was
hot
but
the
devoted
young
man
went
to
both
the
duchessa
was
at
neither
what
does
she
think
will
become
of
her
immortal
soul
he
asked
marietta
on
monday
he
went
to
the
village
before
the
door
a
smart
little
victoria
with
a
pair
of
sprightly
french
bays
was
drawn
up
ducal
coronets
emblazoned
on
its
panels
peter
heart
began
to
beat
and
while
he
was
hesitating
on
the
doorstep
the
door
opened
and
the
duchessa
came
forth
tall
sumptuous
in
white
with
a
wonderful
hat
and
a
wonderful
sunshade
she
was
followed
by
a
young
girl
a
pretty
girl
of
fourteen
fifteen
perhaps
with
pleasant
brown
eyes
that
lucent
italian
brown
and
in
her
cheeks
a
pleasant
hint
of
red
that
covert
italian
red
which
seems
to
glow
through
the
thinnest
film
of
satin
peter
bowed
standing
aside
to
let
them
pass
but
when
he
looked
up
the
duchessa
had
stopped
and
was
smiling
on
him
his
heart
beat
harder
a
lovely
day
said
the
duchessa
delightful
agreed
peter
between
two
yet
he
looked
in
his
grey
flannels
with
his
and
his
eyeglass
with
his
lean
face
his
even
colour
his
slightly
supercilious
moustaches
he
looked
a
very
embodiment
of
english
equanimity
a
trifle
warm
perhaps
the
duchessa
suggested
with
her
air
of
polite
or
was
it
in
some
part
humorous
readiness
to
defer
to
his
opinion
but
surely
suggested
he
in
italy
in
summer
it
is
its
bounden
duty
to
be
a
trifle
warm
the
duchessa
smiled
you
like
it
so
do
i
but
what
the
country
really
needs
is
then
let
us
hope
said
he
that
the
country
real
needs
may
remain
the
duchessa
tittered
think
of
the
poor
farmers
she
said
reproachfully
it
vain
to
think
of
them
he
answered
is
an
ascertained
fact
that
no
condition
of
the
weather
ever
contents
the
the
duchessa
laughed
ah
well
she
consented
then
i
join
in
your
hope
that
the
fine
weather
may
last
i
i
trust
she
was
so
good
as
to
add
that
not
entirely
uncomfortable
at
villa
floriano
i
dare
allow
myself
to
speak
of
villa
floriano
he
replied
i
should
become
dithyrambic
it
too
it
has
a
pretty
garden
and
i
remember
you
admired
the
view
the
duchessa
said
and
that
old
marietta
i
trust
she
does
for
you
fairly
well
her
raised
eyebrows
expressed
benevolent
or
was
it
in
some
part
humorous
concern
she
does
for
me
to
perfection
that
old
marietta
is
a
priceless
old
jewel
peter
vowed
a
good
cook
questioned
the
duchessa
a
good
cook
but
also
a
counsellor
and
friend
and
with
a
flow
of
language
the
duchessa
laughed
again
oh
these
lombard
peasant
women
they
are
untiring
i
not
sure
peter
felt
himself
in
justice
bound
to
confess
that
marietta
is
equally
untiring
as
a
listener
in
fact
there
only
one
respect
in
which
she
has
disappointed
oh
said
the
duchessa
and
her
raised
eyebrows
demanded
particulars
she
swears
she
does
wear
a
dagger
in
her
garter
has
never
heard
of
such
a
practice
peter
explained
and
now
he
whispered
to
his
soul
we
see
whether
our
landlady
is
up
in
modern
still
again
the
duchessa
laughed
and
apparently
she
was
up
in
modern
literature
at
any
rate
those
are
lombard
along
the
coast
she
reminded
him
we
are
peaceful
inland
folk
miles
from
the
sea
but
you
had
best
be
on
your
guard
none
the
she
shook
her
head
in
warning
through
all
this
that
old
marietta
is
reputed
to
be
a
if
she
a
witch
said
peter
undismayed
her
usefulness
will
be
doubled
i
shall
put
her
to
the
test
directly
i
get
sprinkle
her
with
holy
water
laughed
the
duchessa
have
a
care
if
she
should
turn
into
a
black
cat
and
fly
away
on
a
broomstick
never
forgive
wherewith
she
swept
on
to
her
carriage
followed
by
her
young
companion
the
sprightly
french
bays
tossed
their
heads
making
the
harness
tinkle
the
footman
mounted
the
box
the
carriage
rolled
away
but
peter
remained
for
quite
a
minute
motionless
on
the
gazing
bemused
down
the
long
straight
improbable
village
street
with
its
poplars
its
bridge
its
ancient
stone
cross
its
irregular
pink
and
yellow
houses
as
improbable
as
a
street
in
a
thin
cloud
of
dust
floated
after
the
carriage
a
thin
screen
of
white
dust
which
in
the
sun
looked
like
a
fume
of
silver
i
think
i
could
put
my
finger
on
a
witch
worth
two
of
marietta
he
said
in
the
end
and
thus
we
see
he
added
struck
by
something
perhaps
not
altogether
novel
in
his
own
reflection
how
the
primary
emotions
being
perennial
tend
to
express
themselves
in
perennial
vi
back
at
the
villa
he
enquired
of
marietta
who
the
pretty
young
girl
might
have
been
the
signorina
emilia
marietta
promptly
informed
him
really
and
truly
questioned
he
ang
affirmed
marietta
with
the
national
jerk
of
the
head
the
signorina
emilia
manfredi
the
daughter
of
the
oh
then
the
duca
was
married
before
concluded
peter
with
simplicity
scoffed
marietta
on
her
highest
note
married
he
then
she
winked
and
nodded
as
one
man
of
the
world
to
another
ma
molto

but
after
his
death
the
duchessa
had
her
brought
to
the
castle
she
is
the
same
as
that
looks
as
if
your
duchessa
heart
were
in
the
right
place
after
all
commented
peter
gia
agreed
marietta
hang
the
right
place
cried
he
what
the
good
of
telling
me
her
heart
is
in
the
right
place
if
the
right
place
is
inaccessible
but
marietta
only
looked
bewildered
he
lived
in
his
garden
he
haunted
the
riverside
he
made
a
daily
pilgrimage
to
the
village
post
he
thoroughly
neglected
the
work
he
had
come
to
this
quiet
spot
to
do
but
a
week
passed
during
which
he
never
once
beheld
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
the
duchessa
on
sunday
he
trudged
his
mile
through
the
sun
and
up
the
hill
not
only
to
both
masses
but
to
vespers
and
benediction
she
was
present
at
none
of
these
offices
the
pagan
he
exclaimed
vii
up
at
the
castle
on
the
broad
marble
terrace
where
clematis
and
jessamine
climbed
over
the
balustrade
and
twined
about
its
pilasters
where
oleanders
grew
in
tall
marble
urns
and
shed
their
roseate
petals

the
pavement
beatrice
dressed
for

in
white
with

in
her
hair
and
pearls
round
her

was
walking
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
reading
a
letter
there
is
a
peter
marchdale
i
do
know
whether
he
will
be
your
peter
marchdale
or
not
my
dear
though
the
name
seems
hardly
likely
to
be
common
son
of
the
late
archibald
marchdale
and
nephew
of
old
general
marchdale
of
whitstoke
a
highly
respectable
and
stodgy
norfolk
family
i
never
happened
to
meet
the
man
myself
but
told
he
a
bit
of
an
eccentric
who
amuses
himself
and
writing
books
novels
i
believe
which
nobody
so
far
as
i
am
aware
ever
reads
he
writes
under
a
pseudonym
felix
i
not
sure
whether
it
mildmay
or
wildmay
he
began
life
by
the
bye
in
the
diplomatic
and
was
attache
for
a
while
at
berlin
or
petersburg
or
somewhere
but
whether
in
the
elegant
language
of
diplomacy
he
it
up
or
failed
to
pass
his
exams
i
not
in
a
position
to
say
he
will
be
near
thirty
and
ought
to
have
a
couple
of
thousand
a
year
more
or
less
his
father
at
any
rate
was
a
great
man
at
the
bar
and
must
have
left
something
decent
and
the
only
other
thing
in
the
world
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
a
great
friend
of
that
clever
gossip
margaret
winchfield
which
goes
to
show
that
however
obscure
he
may
be
as
a
scribbler
of
fiction
he
must
possess
some
redeeming
virtues
as
a
social
being
for
winchfield
is
by
no
means
the
sort
that
falls
in
love
with
bores
as
you
not
either

gazed
off
over
the

with
its
trees
and
their
long
shadows
with
its
shrubberies
its
bright
its
marble
benches
its
artificial
ruin
over
the

with
its
coloured
sails
its
incongruous

steamboats
down
the

away
to
the
rosy

the
deep

behind

she
plucked
a
spray
of

and
brushed
the
cool
white
blossoms
across
her
cheek
and
inhaled
their
fairy
fragrance
an

on
monday
evening
at
the
end
of
dinner
as
she
set
the
fruit
before
him
the
signorino
will
take
coffee
old
marietta
asked
peter
frowned
at
the
fruit
figs
and
peaches
figs
imperial
purple
and
blushing
peaches
ranged
alternately
with
fine
precision
in
a
circle
round
a
central
heap
of
translucent
yellow
grapes
is
this
the
produce
of
my
own
vine
and
he
demanded
yes
signorino
and
also
replied
marietta
peaches
do
not
grow
on
he
enquired
no
signorino
said
marietta
nor
figs
on
thistles
i
wonder
why
not
said
he
it
is
nature
was
marietta
confident
generalisation
marietta
cignolesi
peter
pronounced
severely
looking
her
hard
in
the
eyes
i
am
told
you
are
a
no
said
marietta
simply
without
surprise
without
emotion
i
quite
understand
he
genially
persisted
it
a
part
of
the
game
to
deny
it
but
i
have
no
intention
of
sprinkling
you
with
holy
do
be
frightened
besides
if
you
should
do
anything
outrageous
if
you
should
turn
into
a
black
cat
and
fly
away
on
a
broomstick
for
example
i
could
never
forgive
myself
but
i
thank
you
to
employ
a
little
of
your
witchcraft
on
my
behalf
all
the
same
i
have
lost
something
something
very
precious
more
precious
than
rubies
more
precious
than
fine
marietta
brown
old
wrinkles
fell
into
an
expression
of
alarm
in
the
villa
in
the
garden
she
exclaimed
anxiously
no
you
conscientious
old
thing
you
peter
hastened
to
relieve
her
nowhere
in
your
jurisdiction
so
do
distress
yourself
laggiu
and
he
waved
a
vague
hand
to
indicate
outer
space
the
signorino
should
put
up
a
candle
to
anthony
of
padua
counselled
this
catholic
witch
st
anthony
of
padua
why
of
padua
asked
peter
st
anthony
of
padua
said
marietta
you
mean
of
lisbon
corrected
peter
no
insisted
the
old
woman
with
energy
st
anthony
of
but
he
was
born
in
lisbon
insisted
peter
no
said
marietta
yes
said
he
parola
d
onore
and
what
more
to
the
purpose
he
died
in
lisbon
you
clearly
mean
anthony
of
no
marietta
raised
her
voice
for
his
speedier
conviction
there
is
no
anthony
of
lisbon
anthony
of
what
the
use
of
sticking
to
your
guns
in
that
obstinate
fashion
peter
complained
it
mere
pride
of
opinion
do
you
know
that
the
ready
concession
of
minor
points
is
a
part
of
the
grace
of
life
when
you
lose
an
object
you
put
up
a
candle
to
anthony
of
padua
said
marietta
weary
but
resolved
not
unless
you
wish
to
recover
the
object
contended
peter
marietta
stared
at
him
blinking
i
have
no
wish
to
recover
the
object
i
have
lost
he
continued
blandly
the
loss
of
it
is
a
new
thrilling
humanising
experience
it
will
make
a
man
of
me
and
let
us
hope
a
better
man
besides
in
a
sense
i
lost
it
long
ago
first
my
smitten
eyes
beat
full
on
her
one
evening
at
the
francais
three
four
years
ago
but
essential
to
my
happiness
that
i
should
see
the
person
into
whose
possession
it
has
fallen
that
is
why
i
am
not
angry
with
you
for
being
a
witch
it
suits
my
convenience
please
arrange
with
the
powers
of
darkness
to
the
end
that
i
may
meet
the
person
in
question
tomorrow
at
the
latest
no
he
raised
a
forbidding
hand
i
will
listen
to
no
protestations
and
for
the
rest
you
may
count
upon
my
absolute
discretion
is
the
darling
of
my
heart
and
she
lives
in
our
valley
he
carolled
softly
e
del
mio
cuore
la
carina
e
dimor
nella
nostra
vallettina
he
obligingly
translated
but
for
all
the
good
i
get
of
her
she
might
as
well
live
on
the
top
of
the
cornobastone
he
added
dismally
yes
now
you
may
bring
me
my
coffee
only
let
it
be
tea
when
your
coffee
is
coffee
it
keeps
me
awake
at
marietta
trudged
back
to
her
kitchen
nodding
at
the
sky
the
next
afternoon
however
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
appeared
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
tumultuous
aco
ix
peter
happened
to
be
engaged
in
the
amiable
pastime
of
tossing
to
his
goldfinches
but
a
score
or
so
of
sparrows
lurked
under
cover
of
the
neighbouring
foliage
to
dash
in
viciously
at
the
critical
moment
and
snatch
the
food
from
the
finches
very
mouths
the
duchessa
watched
this
little
drama
for
a
minute
smiling
in
silent
meditation
while
peter
who
for
a
wonder
had
his
back
turned
to
the
park
of
ventirose
and
for
a
greater
wonder
still
perhaps
felt
no
pricking
in
his
thumbs
remained
unconscious
of
her
presence
at
last
sorrowfully
but
there
was
always
a
smile
at
the
back
of
her
eyes
she
shook
her
head
oh
the
pirates
the
daredevils
she
sighed
peter
started
faced
about
saluted
the
brigands
said
she
with
a
glance
towards
the
sparrows
outposts
yes
poor
things
said
he
poor
things
cried
she
indignant
the
unprincipled
little
monsters
they
ca
help
it
he
pleaded
for
them
is
their
nature
to
they
were
born
so
they
had
no
you
actually
defend
them
she
marvelled
rebukefully
oh
dear
no
he
disclaimed
i
do
defend
them
i
defend
nothing
i
merely
recognise
and
accept
sparrows
finches
it
the
way
of
the
world
the
established
division
of
the
she
frowned
incomprehension
the
established
division
of
the
world
exactly
said
he
sparrows
finches
the
snatchers
and
the
everything
that
breathes
is
either
a
sparrow
or
a
finch
is
the
universal
war
the
struggle
for
existence
the
survival
of
the
most
unscrupulous
is
a
miniature
presentment
of
what
going
on
everywhere
in
earth
and
she
shook
her
head
again
you
see
the
earth
and
sky
through
black
spectacles
i
afraid
she
remarked
with
a
long
face
but
there
was
still
an
underglow
of
amusement
in
her
eyes
no
he
answered
because
there
a
compensation
as
you
rise
in
the
scale
of
moral
development
it
is
true
you
pass
from
the
category
of
the
snatchers
to
the
category
of
the
and
your
ultimate
extinction
is
assured
but
on
the
other
hand
you
gain
talents
and
sensibilities
you
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
these
goldfinches
for
a
case
in
point
can
sing
and
they
have
your
sympathy
the
sparrows
can
only
make
a
horrid
noise
and
you
contemn
them
that
is
the
compensation
the
snatchers
can
never
know
the
joy
of
singing
or
of
being
pitied
by
n
o
perhaps
not
she
consented
doubtfully
the
underglow
of
amusement
in
her
eyes
shone
nearer
to
the
surface
but
but
they
can
never
know
either
the
despair
of
the
singer
when
his
songs
or
when
the
ladies
are
pitiless
that
is
true
consented
peter
and
meanwhile
they
get
the
bread
crumbs
she
said
they
certainly
get
the
he
admitted
i
afraid
she
smiled
as
one
who
has
conducted
a
syllogism
safely
to
its
conclusion
i
afraid
i
do
not
think
your
compensation
to
be
quite
honest
i
daresay
it
does
he
confessed
and
anyhow
she
followed
her
victory
up
i
should
not
wish
my
garden
to
represent
the
universal
war
i
should
not
wish
my
garden
to
be
a
i
should
wish
it
to
be
a
retreat
from
the
battle
an
abode
of
peace
a
happy
valley
a
sanctuary
for
the
but
why
distress
one
soul
with
wishes
that
are
vain
asked
he
what
could
one
do
one
could
keep
a
dragon
she
answered
promptly
if
i
were
you
i
should
keep
a
it
would
do
no
good
said
he
you
get
rid
of
one
species
of
snatcher
but
some
other
species
of
snatcher
would
instantly
pop
she
gazed
at
him
with
those
amused
eyes
of
hers
and
still
again
slowly
sorrowfully
shook
her
head
oh
your
spectacles
are
black
black
she
murmured
i
hope
not
said
he
but
such
as
they
are
they
show
me
the
inevitable
conditions
of
our
planet
the
snatcher
here
below
is
ubiquitous
and
eternal
as
ubiquitous
as
eternal
as
the
force
of
gravitation
he
is
likewise
protean
banish
him
he
takes
half
a
minute
to
change
his
visible
form
and
returns
au
galop
sometimes
he
an
ugly
little
cacophonous
brown
sparrow
sometimes
he
a
splendid
florid
or
an
aproned
and
obsequious
greengrocer
or
a
trusted
friend
hearty
and
familiar
but
he
always
there
and
he
always
if
you
do
mind
the
vernacular
the
snatch
the
duchessa
arched
her
eyebrows
if
things
are
really
at
such
a
sorry
pass
she
said
i
will
commend
my
former
proposal
to
you
with
increased
confidence
you
should
keep
a
dragon
after
all
you
only
wish
to
protect
your
garden
and
that
she
embraced
it
with
her
glance
is
not
so
very
big
you
could
teach
your
dragon
if
you
procured
one
of
an
intelligent
breed
to
devour
greengrocers
trusted
friends
and
even
moneylenders
too
tough
though
no
doubt
they
are
as
well
as
your
proposal
is
a
surrender
to
my
contention
said
peter
you
would
set
a
snatcher
to
catch
the
snatchers
other
heights
in
other
lives
perhaps
but
in
the
dark
backward
and
abysm
of
space
to
which
our
lives
are
confined
the
snatcher
is
indigenous
and
the
duchessa
looked
at
the
sunny
landscape
the
bright
lawns
the
high
bending
trees
with
the
light
caught
in
the
network
of
their
million
leaves
she
looked
at
the
laughing
white
villas
westward
the
vineyards
the
yellow
cornfields
she
looked
at
the
rushing
river
with
the
diamonds
sparkling
on
its
surface
at
the
gleaming
snows
of
monte
sfiorito
at
the
scintillant
blue
shy
overhead
then
she
looked
at
peter
a
fine
admixture
of
mirth
with
something
like
gravity
in
her
smile
the
dark
backward
and
abysm
of
space
she
repeated
and
you
do
not
wear
black
spectacles
then
it
must
be
that
your
eyes
themselves
are
just
a
pair
of
on
the
contrary
triumphed
peter
it
is
because
they
are
optimists
that
they
suspect
there
must
be
forwarder
and
more
luminous
regions
than
the
solar
the
duchessa
laughed
i
think
you
have
the
prettiest
mouth
and
the
most
exquisite
little
teeth
and
the
eyes
richest
in
promise
and
the
sweetest
laughter
of
any
woman
out
of
paradise
said
peter
in
the
silence
of
his
soul
it
is
clear
i
shall
never
be
your
match
in
debate
said
she
peter
made
a
gesture
of
deprecating
modesty
but
i
wonder
she
went
on
whether
you
would
put
me
down
as
species
of
snatcher
if
i
should
ask
you
to
spare
me
just
the
merest
end
of
a
crust
of
bread
and
she
lifted
those
eyes
rich
in
promise
appealingly
to
his
oh
i
beg
of
you
take
all
i
have
he
responded
with
effusion
but
but
how
toss
she
commanded
tersely
so
he
tossed
what
was
left
of
his
bread
into
the
air
above
the
river
and
the
duchessa
easily
deftly
threw
up
a
hand
and
caught
it
on
the
wing
thank
you
very
much
she
laughed
with
a
little
bow
then
she
crumbled
the
bread
and
began
to
sprinkle
the
ground
with
it
and
in
an
instant
she
was
the
centre
of
a
cloud
of
birds
peter
was
at
liberty
to
watch
her
to
admire
the
swift
grace
of
her
motions
their
suggestion
of
delicate
strength
of
joy
in
things
physical
and
the
lithe
elasticity
of
her
figure
against
the
background
of
satiny
lawn
and
the
further
vistas
of
lofty
sunlit
trees
she
was
dressed
in
white
as
always
a
frock
of
i
know
not
what
supple
fabric
that
looked
as
if
you
might
have
passed
it
through
your
ring
and
fell
in
multitudes
of
small
soft
creases
two
big
red
roses
drooped
from
her
bodice
she
wore
a
of
white
straw
with
a
big
daring
bow
under
which
the
dense
meshes
of
her
hair
warmly
dark
dimly
bright
shimmered
in
a
blur
of
brownish
gold
what
vigour
what
verve
what
health
thought
peter
watching
her
what
lean
fresh
fragrant
health
and
he
had
no
doubt
his
emotions
she
bestowed
her
bread
crumbs
on
the
birds
but
she
was
able
somehow
to
discriminate
mightily
in
favour
of
the
goldfinches
she
would
make
a
diversion
the
semblance
of
a
fling
with
her
empty
right
hand
and
the
sparrows
would
dart
off
avid
on
that
false
lead
whereupon
quickly
stealthily
she
would
rain
a
little
shower
of
crumbs
from
her
left
hand
on
the
grass
beside
her
to
a
confiding
group
of
finches
assembled
there
and
if
ever
a
sparrow
ventured
to
intrude
his
ruffianly
black
beak
into
this
sacred
quarter
she
would
manage
with
a
kind
of
restrained
ferocity
to
shoo
him
away
without
thereby
frightening
the
finches
and
all
the
while
her
eyes
laughed
and
there
was
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
there
was
the
forceful
graceful
action
of
her
body
when
the
bread
was
finished
she
clapped
her
hands
together
gently
to
dust
the
last
mites
from
them
and
looked
over
at
peter
and
smiled
significantly
yes
he
acknowledged
you
outwitted
them
very
skilfully
you
at
any
rate
have
no
need
of
a
oh
in
default
of
a
dragon
one
can
do
dragon
work
oneself
she
answered
lightly
or
rather
one
can
make
oneself
an
instrument
of
all
the
same
i
should
call
it
uncommonly
hard
luck
to
be
born
a
sparrow
within
your
jurisdiction
he
said
it
is
not
an
affair
of
luck
said
she
one
is
born
a
sparrow
within
my
jurisdiction
for
one
sins
in
a
former
no
you
little
dovelings
she
turned
to
a
pair
of
finches
on
the
greensward
near
her
who
were
lingering
and
gazing
up
into
her
face
with
hungry
expectant
eyes
i
have
no
more
i
have
given
you
my
and
she
stretched
out
her
open
hands
palms
downwards
to
convince
them
the
sparrows
got
nothing
and
the
goldfinches
who
got
all
grumble
because
you
gave
so
little
said
peter
sadly
that
is
what
comes
of
interfering
with
the
laws
of
and
then
as
the
two
birds
flew
away
see
the
dark
doubtful
reproachful
glances
with
which
they
cover
you
think
they
are
ungrateful
she
said
no
she
held
up
a
finger
for
at
that
moment
on
the
branch
of
an
acacia
just
over
her
head
a
goldfinch
began
to
sing
his
thin
sweet
crystalline
trill
of
song
do
you
call
that
grumbling
she
asked
it
implies
a
grumble
said
peter
like
the
you
of
a
servant
dissatisfied
with
his
tip
it
the
very
least
he
can
do
perfunctory
i
not
sure
it
is
even
perfunctory
ironical
cried
the
duchessa
look
at
him
he
warbling
his
delicious
little
soul
they
both
paused
to
look
and
listen
the
bird
bosom
palpitated
he
marked
his
modulations
by
sudden
emphatic
movements
of
the
head
his
eyes
were
fixed
intently
before
him
as
if
he
could
actually
see
and
follow
the
shining
thread
of
his
song
as
it
wound
away
through
the
air
his
performance
had
all
the
effect
of
a
spontaneous
rhapsody
when
it
was
terminated
he
looked
down
at
his
auditors
eager
inquisitive
as
who
should
say
i
hope
you
liked
it
and
then
with
a
nod
clearly
meant
as
a
farewell
flew
out
of
sight
the
duchessa
smiled
again
at
peter
with
intention
you
must
really
try
to
take
a
cheerier
view
of
things
she
said
and
next
instant
she
too
was
off
walking
slowly
lightly
up
the
green
lawns
between
the
trees
towards
the
castle
her
gown
fluttering
in
the
breeze
now
dazzling
white
as
she
came
into
the
sun
now
pearly
grey
as
she
passed
into
the
shade
what
a
woman
it
is
said
peter
to
himself
looking
after
her
what
vigour
what
verve
what
sex
what
a
woman
and
indeed
there
was
nothing
of
the
epicene
in
the
duchessa
aspect
she
was
very
certainly
a
woman
heavens
how
she
walks
he
cried
in
a
deep
whisper
but
then
a
sudden
wave
of
dejection
swept
over
him
at
first
he
could
not
account
for
it
by
and
by
however
a
malicious
little
voice
began
to
repeat
and
repeat
within
him
oh
the
futile
impression
you
must
have
made
upon
her
oh
the
ineptitudes
you
uttered
oh
the
precious
opportunity
you
have
misemployed
you
are
a
witch
he
said
to
marietta
you
proved
it
to
the
hilt
i
seen
the
person
and
the
object
is
more
desperately
lost
than
x
that
evening
among
the
letters
peter
received
from
england
there
was
one
from
his
friend
winchfield
which
contained
certain
statistics
your
duchessa
di
santangiolo
indeed
as
your
funny
old
servant
told
you
english
the
only
child
and
heiress
of
the
last
lord
belfont
the
belfonts
of
lancashire
now
save
for
your
duchessa
extinct
were
the
most
bigoted
sort
of
roman
catholics
and
always
educated
their
daughters
in
foreign
convents
and
as
often
as
not
married
them
to
foreigners
the
belfont
men
besides
were
ever
and
anon
marrying
foreign
wives
so
there
will
be
a
goodish
deal
of
blood
in
your
duchessa
own
english
veins
she
was
born
as
i
learn
from
an
indiscretion
of
my
peerage
in
and
is
therefore
as
near
to
thirty
the
dangerous
age
as
to
the
your
droll
old
marietta
gives
her
her
christian
names
are
beatrice
antonia
teresa
mary
faites
en
votre
choix
she
was
married
at
nineteen
to
baldassarre
agosto
principe
udeschini
duca
di
santangiolo
marchese
di
castellofranco
count
of
the
holy
roman
empire
knight
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
gregory
does
it
take
your
breath
away
who
according
to
frontin
died
in
and
as
there
were
no
children
his
brother
felipe
lorenzo
succeeded
to
the
titles
a
younger
brother
still
is
bishop
of
sardagna
cardinal
udeschini
is
the
uncle
that
dear
child
empties
my
sack
of
information
but
perhaps
i
have
a
bigger
sack
full
of
good
advice
which
i
have
not
yet
opened
and
perhaps
on
the
whole
i
will
not
open
it
at
all
only
remember
that
in
yonder
sentimental
italian
lake
country
in
this
summer
weather
a
solitary
young
man
fancy
might
be
much
inclined
to
turn
to
thoughts
of
folly
and
keep
an
eye
on
my
friend
peter
our
solitary
young
man
brooded
over
winchfield
letter
for
a
long
while
the
daughter
of
a
lord
and
the
widow
of
a
duke
and
the
of
a
cardinal
he
said
and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
a
bigoted
roman
catholic
into
the
bargain
and
yet
and
yet
he
went
on
taking
heart
a
little
as
for
her
bigotry
to
judge
by
her
assiduity
in
attending
the
village
church
that
factor
at
least
thank
goodness
would
appear
to
be
static
rather
than
after
another
longish
interval
of
brooding
he
sauntered
down
to
the
riverside
through
his
fragrant
garden
fragrant
and
fresh
with
the
cool
odours
of
the
night
and
peered
into
the
darkness
towards
castel
ventirose
here
and
there
he
could
discern
a
gleam
of
yellow
where
some
lighted
window
was
not
entirely
hidden
by
the
trees
thousands
and
thousands
of
insects
were
threading
the
silence
with
their
shrill
insistent
voices
the
repeated
wail
harsh
prolonged
eerie
of
some
strange
wild
creature
bird
or
beast
came
down
from
the
forest
of
the
gnisi
at
his
feet
on
the
troubled
surface
of
the
aco
the
stars
reflected
and
distorted
shone
like
broken
spearheads
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
stood
there
till
he
had
consumed
it
he
sighed
at
last
and
turned
back
towards
the
villa
and
yes
he
concluded
i
must
certainly
keep
an
eye
on
our
friend
peter
but
i
doubting
it
a
bit
too
late
troppo
tardo
he
said
to
marietta
whom
he
found
bringing
hot
water
to
his
it
is
not
very
late
said
marietta
only
she
is
a
woman
therefore
to
be
loved
she
is
a
duchess
therefore
to
be
lost
he
explained
in
his
native
tongue
questioned
marietta
in
hers
xi
beatrice
and
emilia
strolling
together
in
one
of
the
flowery
lanes
up
the
hillside
between
ranks
of
the
omnipresent
poplar
and
hedges
or
crumbling
walls
that
dripped
with
cyclamen
and
snapdragon
met
old
marietta
descending
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
marietta
courtesied
to
the
ground
how
do
you
do
marietta
beatrice
asked
i
ca
complain
thank
your
grandeur
i
have
the
lumbago
on
and
off
pretty
constantly
and
last
week
i
broke
a
tooth
but
i
ca
complain
and
your
highness
marietta
returned
with
brisk
aplomb
beatrice
smiled
bene
grazie
your
new
master
that
young
englishman
she
continued
i
hope
you
find
him
kind
and
easy
to
do
for
kind
yes
excellency
also
easy
to
do
for
but
marietta
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
gave
her
head
two
meaning
oscillations
oh
wondered
beatrice
knitting
puzzled
brows
very
amiable
your
greatness
but
simple
simple
marietta
explained
and
tapped
her
brown
old
forehead
with
a
brown
forefinger
really
wondered
beatrice
yes
nobility
said
marietta
gentle
as
a
canarybird
but
innocent
you
astonish
me
beatrice
avowed
how
does
he
show
it
the
questions
he
asks
most
illustrious
the
things
he
for
example
pursued
beatrice
for
example
your
serenity
marietta
paused
to
search
her
well
for
one
example
he
calls
roast
veal
a
fowl
i
give
him
roast
veal
for
his
luncheon
and
he
says
to
me
this
fowl
has
no
wings
but
everyone
knows
your
mercy
that
veal
is
not
a
fowl
how
should
veal
have
wings
how
indeed
assented
beatrice
on
a
note
of
commiseration
and
if
the
corners
of
her
mouth
betrayed
a
tendency
to
curve
upwards
she
immediately
compelled
them
down
but
perhaps
he
does
not
speak
italian
very
well
she
suggested
mache
potenza
everyone
speaks
italian
cried
marietta
indeed
said
beatrice
naturally
your
grace
all
christians
marietta
declared
oh
i
did
know
said
beatrice
meekly
well
she
acknowledged
since
he
speaks
italian
it
is
certainly
unreasonable
of
him
to
call
veal
a
but
that
magnificence
marietta
went
on
warming
to
her
theme
that
is
only
one
of
his
simplicities
he
asks
me
puts
the
whitewash
on
monte
sfiorito
when
i
tell
him
that
it
is
not
whitewash
but
snow
he
says
do
you
know
but
everyone
knows
that
it
is
snow
whitewash
the
sprightly
old
woman
gave
her
whole
body
a
shake
for
the
better
exposition
of
her
state
of
mind
and
thereupon
from
the
interior
of
her
basket
issued
a
plaintive
little
squeal
what
have
you
in
your
basket
beatrice
asked
a
little
piglet
nobility
un
piccolo
porcellino
said
marietta
and
lifting
the
cover
an
inch
or
two
she
displayed
the
anxious
face
of
a
poor
little
sucking
pig
e
carino
she
demanded
whilst
her
eyes
beamed
with
a
pride
that
almost
seemed
maternal
what
on
earth
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
beatrice
gasped
the
light
of
pride
gave
place
to
a
light
of
resolution
in
eyes
kill
him
mightiness
was
her
grim
response
stuff
him
with
almonds
raisins
rosemary
and
onions
cook
him
sweet
and
sour
and
serve
him
garnished
with
rosettes
of
for
my
signorino
sunday
shuddered
beatrice
and
emilia
in
a
breath
and
they
resumed
their
walk
xii
francois
was
dining
with
an
appearance
of
great
fervour
peter
sat
on
his
rustic
bench
by
the
riverside
and
watched
him
smoking
a
cigarette
the
while
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
stood
screened
by
a
tree
in
the
park
of
ventirose
and
watched
them
both
francois
wore
a
wide
blue
ribbon
round
his
pink
and
chubby
neck
and
his
dinner
consisted
of
a
big
bowlful
of
bread
and
milk
presently
the
duchessa
stepped
forth
from
her
ambush
into
the
sun
and
laughed
what
a
sweetly
pretty
scene
she
said
pastoral
idyllic
it
reminds
one
of
theocritus
it
reminds
one
of
peter
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
river
and
made
an
obeisance
i
am
very
glad
you
feel
the
charm
of
it
he
responded
may
i
be
permitted
to
present
master
francois
vllon
we
have
met
before
said
the
duchessa
graciously
smiling
upon
francois
and
inclining
her
head
oh
i
did
know
said
peter
apologetic
yes
said
the
duchessa
and
in
rather
tragical
circumstances
but
at
that
time
he
was
anonymous
why
if
you
wo
think
my
curiosity
impertinent
why
francois
villon
why
not
said
peter
he
made
such
a
tremendous
outcry
when
he
was
condemned
to
death
for
one
thing
you
should
have
heard
him
he
has
a
voice
then
for
another
he
takes
such
a
passionate
interest
in
his
meat
and
drink
and
then
if
you
come
to
that
i
really
had
the
heart
to
call
him
pauvre
the
duchessa
raised
amused
eyebrows
you
felt
that
pauvre
lelian
was
the
only
alternative
i
had
in
mind
a
remark
of
pauvre
lilian
friend
and
confrere
the
cryptic
stephane
peter
answered
you
will
remember
it
poete
dans
le
corps
i
i
forget
the
last
word
he
faltered
shall
we
say
pig
suggested
the
duchessa
oh
please
do
cried
peter
hastily
with
a
gesture
of
supplication
do
say
in
his
presence
you
wound
his
the
duchessa
laughed
i
knew
he
was
condemned
to
death
she
owned
indeed
it
was
in
his
condemned
cell
that
i
made
his
acquaintance
your
marietta
cignolesi
introduced
us
her
air
was
so
inexorable
i
a
good
deal
surprised
to
see
him
alive
there
was
some
question
of
a
stuffing
of
rosemary
and
ah
i
see
said
peter
i
see
that
you
familiar
with
the
whole
disgraceful
story
yes
marietta
the
unspeakable
old
tartar
was
all
for
stuffing
him
with
rosemary
and
onions
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
share
her
point
of
view
he
screamed
his
protest
like
a
man
in
twenty
different
octaves
you
really
should
have
heard
him
his
voice
is
of
a
compass
of
a
timbre
of
an
expressiveness
passive
endurance
i
fear
is
not
his
forte
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
silence
i
intervened
interceded
she
had
her
knife
at
his
very
throat
i
was
not
an
instant
too
soon
so
of
course
i
had
to
adopt
of
course
poor
man
sympathised
the
duchessa
it
a
recognised
principle
that
if
you
save
a
fellow
life
you
bound
to
him
for
the
rest
of
yours
but
but
wo
you
find
him
rather
a
burdensome
responsibility
when
he
grownup
she
reflected
que
reflected
peter
burdensome
responsibilities
are
the
appointed
accompaniments
of
man
pilgrimage
why
not
francois
villon
as
well
as
another
and
besides
as
the
world
is
at
present
organised
a
member
of
the
class
vulgarly
styled
rich
can
generally
manage
to
shift
his
responsibilities
when
they
become
too
irksome
upon
the
backs
of
the
poor
for
example
marietta
marietta
he
called
raising
his
voice
a
little
and
clapping
his
hands
marietta
came
when
she
had
made
her
courtesy
to
the
duchessa
and
a
polite
enquiry
as
to
her
excellency
health
peter
said
with
an
indicative
nod
of
the
head
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
remove
my
responsibility
il
porcellino
questioned
marietta
ang
said
he
and
when
marietta
had
borne
francois
struggling
and
squealing
in
her
arms
from
the
foreground
there
you
see
how
it
is
done
he
remarked
the
duchessa
laughed
an
she
agreed
an
in
might
one
call
it
the
science
of
applied
cynicism
science
peter
plaintively
repudiated
the
word
no
no
i
was
rather
flattering
myself
it
was
an
apropos
of
art
said
the
duchessa
she
came
down
two
or
three
steps
nearer
to
the
brink
of
the
river
she
produced
from
behind
her
back
a
hand
that
she
had
kept
there
and
held
up
for
peter
inspection
a
bound
book
apropos
of
art
i
been
reading
a
novel
do
you
know
it
peter
glanced
at
the
binding
and
dissembled
the
emotion
that
suddenly
swelled
big
in
his
heart
he
screwed
his
eyeglass
into
his
eye
and
gave
an
intent
look
i
ca
make
out
the
title
he
temporised
shaking
his
head
and
letting
his
eyeglass
drop
on
the
whole
it
was
very
well
acted
and
i
hope
the
occult
little
smile
that
played
about
the
duchessa
lips
was
a
smile
of
appreciation
it
has
a
highly
appropriate
title
she
said
it
is
called
man
of
words
by
an
author
i
never
happened
to
hear
of
before
named
felix
oh
yes
how
very
odd
said
peter
by
a
curious
chance
i
know
it
very
well
but
i
surprised
to
discover
that
you
do
how
on
earth
did
it
fall
into
your
hands
why
on
earth
should
it
wondered
she
novels
are
intended
to
fall
into
people
hands
are
they
not
i
believe
so
he
assented
but
intentions
in
this
vale
of
tears
are
not
always
realised
are
they
anyhow
man
of
words
is
not
like
other
novels
it
peculiar
she
repeated
of
a
peculiar
of
an
unparalleled
obscurity
he
explained
there
has
been
no
failure
approaching
it
since
invented
printing
i
had
supposed
that
seven
copies
of
it
were
in
really
said
the
duchessa
a
correspondent
of
mine
in
london
recommended
it
but
in
view
of
its
unparalleled
obscurity
is
it
almost
equally
a
matter
for
surprise
that
you
should
know
it
it
would
be
sure
enough
consented
peter
if
it
were
that
i
just
happen
also
to
know
the
oh
you
know
the
author
cried
the
duchessa
with
animation
comme
ma
poche
said
peter
we
were
boys
really
said
she
what
a
yes
said
he
and
and
his
book
her
eyebrows
went
up
interrogative
i
expect
as
you
know
the
man
you
think
rather
poorly
of
it
on
the
contrary
in
the
teeth
of
verisimilitude
i
think
extremely
well
of
it
he
answered
firmly
i
admire
it
immensely
i
think
an
altogether
ripping
little
book
i
think
it
one
of
the
nicest
little
books
i
read
for
ages
how
funny
said
she
why
funny
asked
he
it
so
unlikely
that
one
should
seem
a
genius
to
one
old
familiar
did
i
say
he
seemed
a
genius
to
me
i
misled
you
he
does
in
fact
he
very
frequently
seems
but
for
charity
sake
i
best
forbear
to
tell
however
i
admire
his
book
and
to
be
entirely
frank
it
a
constant
source
of
astonishment
to
me
that
he
should
ever
have
been
able
to
do
anything
so
the
duchessa
smiled
pensively
ah
well
she
mused
we
must
assume
that
he
has
happy
moments
or
perhaps
two
one
to
face
the
world
with
one
to
show
his
manuscripts
when
he
writing
you
hint
a
fault
and
hesitate
dislike
that
indeed
is
only
natural
on
the
part
of
an
old
friend
but
you
pique
my
interest
what
is
the
trouble
with
him
is
is
he
conceited
for
example
the
trouble
with
him
peter
pondered
oh
it
would
be
too
long
and
too
sad
a
story
should
i
anatomise
him
to
you
as
he
is
i
must
blush
and
weep
and
you
must
look
pale
and
wonder
he
has
pretty
nearly
every
weakness
not
to
mention
vices
that
flesh
is
heir
to
but
as
for
conceit
let
me
see
he
concurs
in
my
own
high
opinion
of
his
work
i
believe
but
i
do
know
whether
as
literary
men
go
it
would
be
fair
to
call
him
conceited
he
belongs
at
any
rate
to
the
comparatively
modest
minority
who
do
not
secretly
fancy
that
shakespeare
has
come
back
to
that
shakespeare
has
come
back
to
life
marvelled
the
duchessa
do
you
mean
to
say
that
most
literary
men
fancy
that
i
think
perhaps
i
am
acquainted
with
three
who
do
peter
replied
but
one
of
them
merely
wears
his
rue
with
a
difference
he
fancies
that
it
how
extravagantly
how
exquisitely
droll
she
laughed
i
confess
it
struck
me
so
until
i
got
accustomed
to
it
said
he
until
i
learned
that
it
was
one
of
the
commonplaces
one
of
the
normal
attributes
of
the
literary
temperament
it
as
much
to
be
taken
for
granted
when
you
meet
an
author
as
the
tail
is
to
be
taken
for
granted
when
you
meet
a
i
vastly
your
debtor
for
the
information
it
will
stand
me
in
stead
with
the
next
author
who
comes
my
way
but
in
that
case
your
friend
felix
wildmay
will
be
as
it
were
a
sort
of
manx
cat
was
her
smiling
deduction
yes
if
you
like
in
that
particular
a
sort
of
manx
cat
acquiesced
peter
with
a
laugh
the
duchessa
laughed
too
and
then
there
was
a
little
pause
overhead
never
so
light
a
breeze
lisped
never
so
faintly
in
the
here
and
there
fell
liquid
desultory
like
drops
of
rain
after
a
shower
and
constantly
one
heard
the
cool
music
of
the
river
the
sun
filtering
through
worlds
and
worlds
of
leaves
shed
upon
everything
a
penumbra
the
air
warm
and
still
was
sweet
with
the
lake
according
to
its
habit
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
had
drawn
a
grey
veil
over
its
face
a
thin
grey
veil
through
which
its
shone
furtively
far
away
in
the
summer
haze
monte
sfiorito
seemed
a
mere
dim
spectre
of
itself
a
stranger
might
easily
have
mistaken
it
for
a
vague
mass
of
cloud
floating
above
the
horizon
are
you
aware
that
it
a
singularly
lovely
afternoon
the
duchessa
asked
by
and
by
i
have
a
hundred
reasons
for
thinking
it
so
peter
hazarded
with
the
least
perceptible
approach
to
a
meaning
bow
in
the
duchessa
face
perhaps
there
flickered
for
the
least
perceptible
light
as
of
a
comprehending
and
unresentful
smile
but
she
went
on
with
fine
aloofness
i
rather
envy
you
your
river
you
know
we
are
too
far
from
it
at
the
castle
is
the
sound
the
murmur
of
it
delicious
and
its
colour
how
does
it
come
by
such
a
subtle
colour
is
it
green
is
it
blue
and
the
diamonds
on
its
surface
see
how
they
glitter
you
know
of
course
she
questioned
who
the
owner
is
of
those
unequalled
gems
surely
peter
answered
the
lady
paramount
of
this
demesne
no
she
shook
her
head
smiling
undine
they
are
undine
her
necklaces
and
tiaras
no
mortal
woman
contains
anything
half
so
brilliant
but
look
at
them
look
at
the
long
chains
of
them
how
they
float
for
a
minute
and
are
then
drawn
down
they
are
undine
undine
and
her
companions
are
sporting
with
them
just
below
the
surface
a
moment
ago
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
ah
said
peter
nodding
thoughtfully
that
what
it
is
to
have
seeing
eye
but
i
grieved
to
hear
of
undine
in
such
a
wanton
mood
i
had
hoped
she
would
still
be
weeping
her
unhappy
what
with
that
horrid
stolid
german
hildebrandt
was
his
name
cried
the
duchessa
not
she
long
ago
i
glad
to
say
she
learned
to
laugh
at
that
as
a
mere
caprice
of
her
immaturity
however
this
is
a
digression
i
want
to
return
to
our
of
words
tell
me
what
is
the
quality
you
especially
like
in
it
i
like
its
every
quality
peter
affirmed
unblushing
its
style
its
finish
its
concentration
its
wit
humour
sentiment
its
texture
tone
atmosphere
its
scenes
its
subject
the
paper
it
printed
on
the
type
the
binding
but
above
all
i
like
its
heroine
i
think
pauline
de
fleuvieres
the
pearl
of
human
women
the
cleverest
the
loveliest
the
most
desirable
the
most
exasperating
and
also
the
most
feminine
i
ca
think
of
her
at
all
as
a
mere
fiction
a
mere
shadow
on
paper
i
think
of
her
as
a
living
breathing
woman
whom
i
have
actually
known
i
can
see
her
before
me
now
i
can
see
her
eyes
full
of
mystery
and
mischief
i
can
see
her
exquisite
little
teeth
as
she
smiles
i
can
see
her
hair
her
hands
i
can
almost
catch
the
perfume
of
her
garments
i
utterly
infatuated
with
her
i
could
commit
a
hundred
follies
for
mercy
exclaimed
the
duchessa
you
are
the
book
admirers
are
so
few
they
must
endeavour
to
make
up
in
enthusiasm
what
they
lack
in
numbers
he
submitted
but
at
that
rate
why
are
they
so
few
she
puzzled
if
the
book
is
all
you
think
it
how
do
you
account
for
its
unpopularity
it
could
never
conceivably
be
anything
but
unpopular
said
he
it
has
the
fatal
gift
of
the
duchessa
laughed
surprise
is
beauty
a
fatal
gift
in
works
of
art
yes
in
england
he
declared
in
england
why
especially
in
england
in
in
lands
if
you
prefer
the
public
is
they
have
fifty
religions
only
one
sauce
and
no
sense
of
beauty
whatsoever
they
can
see
the
nose
on
face
the
mote
in
their
neighbour
eye
they
can
see
when
a
bargain
is
good
when
a
war
will
be
expedient
but
the
one
thing
they
can
never
see
is
beauty
and
when
by
some
rare
chance
you
catch
them
in
the
act
of
admiring
a
beautiful
object
it
will
never
be
for
its
beauty
it
will
be
in
spite
of
its
beauty
for
some
other
some
interest
it
possesses
some
topical
or
historical
interest
beauty
is
necessarily
detached
from
all
that
is
topical
or
historical
or
documentary
or
actual
it
is
also
necessarily
an
effect
of
fine
shades
delicate
values
vanishing
distinctions
of
evasiveness
inconsequence
suggestion
it
is
also
absolute
unrelated
it
is
positive
or
negative
or
superlative
it
is
never
comparative
well
the
public
is
totally
insensible
to
such
things
they
can
no
more
feel
them
than
a
blind
worm
can
feel
the
colours
of
the
she
laughed
again
and
regarded
him
with
an
air
of
humorous
meditation
and
that
accounts
for
the
unsuccess
of
man
of
words
you
might
as
well
offer
francois
villon
a
banquet
of
orient
you
are
bitterly
hard
on
the
oh
no
he
disclaimed
not
hard
but
just
i
wish
them
all
sorts
of
prosperity
with
a
little
more
oh
but
surely
she
caught
him
up
if
their
taste
were
greater
their
prosperity
would
be
less
i
do
know
said
he
the
greeks
were
fairly
prosperous
were
they
and
the
venetians
and
the
french
are
not
yet
quite
still
again
she
laughed
always
with
that
little
air
of
humorous
meditation
you
you
do
exactly
overwhelm
one
with
compliments
she
observed
he
looked
alarm
anxiety
do
i
what
have
i
neglected
he
cried
you
never
once
evinced
the
slightest
curiosity
to
learn
what
i
think
of
the
book
in
oh
i
sure
you
like
it
he
rejoined
hardily
you
have
seeing
eye
and
yet
i
just
a
humble
member
of
the
no
you
a
distinguished
member
of
the
thank
heaven
there
a
remnant
a
little
scattered
remnant
i
perfectly
sure
you
like
man
of
words
it
is
a
proposition
so
general
perhaps
i
am
burning
to
tell
someone
what
i
think
of
it
in
she
smiled
into
his
eyes
a
trifle
oddly
if
you
are
then
i
know
someone
who
is
burning
to
hear
you
he
avowed
well
then
i
think
i
think
she
began
on
a
note
of
deliberation
but
i
afraid
just
now
it
would
take
too
long
to
formulate
my
thought
perhaps
i
try
another
she
gave
him
a
derisory
little
nod
and
in
a
minute
was
well
up
the
lawn
towards
the
castle
peter
glared
after
her
his
fists
clenched
teeth
set
you
fiend
he
muttered
then
turning
savagely
upon
himself
you
duffer
nevertheless
that
evening
he
said
to
marietta
the
plot
thickens
we
advanced
a
step
we
reached
what
the
vulgar
call
a
psychological
moment
she
seen
my
portrait
of
a
lady
but
as
yet
if
you
can
believe
me
she
does
dream
who
painted
it
and
she
has
recognised
the
subject
as
if
one
were
to
face
one
image
in
the
glass
and
take
it
for
another
i
i
double
your
wages
if
you
will
induce
events
to
hurry
however
as
he
spoke
english
marietta

in
no

by
his
offer
xiii
peter
was
walking
in
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
great
that
leads
from
bergamo
to
milan
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
already
in
the
west
the
sky
was
beginning
to
put
on
some
of
its
sunset
splendours
in
the
east
framed
to
peter
vision
by
parallel
lines
of
poplars
it
hung
like
a
curtain
of
velvet
peter
sat
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
in
the
shadow
of
a
hedge
a
hedge
of
course
and
lighted
a
cigarette
far
down
the
long
white
road
against
the
blue
velvet
sky
between
the
poplars
two
little
spots
of
black
two
small
human
figures
were
moving
towards
him
half
absently
he
let
his
eyes
accompany
them
as
they
came
nearer
they
defined
themselves
as
a
boy
and
a
girl
nearer
still
he
saw
that
they
were
ragged
and
dusty
and
barefoot
the
boy
had
three
or
four
wicker
baskets
slung
over
his
shoulder
vaguely
tacitly
peter
supposed
that
they
would
be
the
children
of
some
of
the
peasants
of
the
countryside
on
their
way
home
from
the
village
as
they
arrived
abreast
of
him
they
paid
him
the
usual
salute
the
boy
lifted
a
tattered
felt
hat
from
his
head
the
girl
bobbed
a
courtesy
and
buona
sera
eccellenza
they
said
in
concert
without
however
pausing
in
their
march
peter
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
here
little
girl
he
called
the
little
girl
glanced
at
him
doubting
come
here
he
said
her
face
a
question
she
came
up
to
him
and
he
gave
her
a
few
coppers
to
buy
sweetmeats
he
said
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
said
she
bobbing
another
courtesy
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
said
the
boy
from
his
distance
again
lifting
his
rag
of
a
hat
and
they
trudged
on
but
peter
looked
after
them
and
his
heart
smote
him
they
were
clearly
of
the
poorest
of
the
poor
he
thought
of
hansel
and
gretel
why
had
he
given
them
so
little
he
called
to
them
to
stop
the
little
girl
came
running
back
peter
rose
to
meet
her
you
may
as
well
buy
some
ribbons
too
he
said
and
gave
her
a
couple
of
lire
she
looked
at
the
money
with
surprise
even
with
an
appearance
of
hesitation
plainly
it
was
a
sum
in
her
eyes
it
all
right
now
run
along
said
peter
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
said
she
with
a
third
courtesy
and
rejoined
her
brother
where
are
they
going
asked
a
voice
peter
faced
about
there
stood
the
duchessa
in
a
bicycling
costume
her
bicycle
beside
her
her
bicycling
costume
was
of
blue
serge
and
she
wore
a
jaunty
with
a
blue
ribbon
peter
in
spite
of
the
commotion
in
his
breast
was
able
to
remember
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
in
anything
but
white
her
attention
was
all
upon
the
children
whom
he
perhaps
had
more
or
less
banished
to
cracklimbo
where
are
they
going
she
repeated
trouble
in
her
voice
and
in
her
eyes
peter
collected
himself
the
children
i
do
know
i
did
ask
home
are
they
home
oh
no
they
do
live
hereabouts
she
said
i
know
all
the
poor
of
this
ohe
there
children
children
she
cried
but
they
were
quite
a
hundred
yards
away
and
did
not
hear
do
you
wish
them
to
come
back
asked
peter
yes
of
course
she
answered
with
a
shade
of
impatience
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
you
know
the
schoolboy
accomplishment
and
gave
a
long
whistle
that
the
children
did
hear
they
halted
and
turned
round
looking
enquiring
come
back
come
back
called
the
duchessa
raising
her
hand
and
beckoning
they
came
back
the
pathetic
little
imps
she
murmured
while
they
were
on
the
way
the
boy
was
a
sturdy
fellow
of
twelve
thirteen
with
a
shock
of
brown
hair
brown
cheeks
and
sunny
brown
eyes
with
a
precocious
air
of
doggedness
of
responsibility
he
wore
an
old
the
of
a
man
ragged
discoloured
falling
to
his
ankles
the
girl
was
ten
or
eleven
pale
pinched
hungry
weary
and
sorry
looking
her
hair
too
had
been
brown
upon
a
time
but
now
it
was
faded
to
something
near
the
tint
of
ashes
and
had
almost
the
effect
of
being
grey
her
pale
little
forehead
was
crossed
by
thin
wrinkles
lines
of
pain
of
worry
like
an
old
woman
the
duchessa
pushing
her
bicycle
and
followed
by
peter
moved
down
the
road
to
meet
them
peter
had
never
been
so
near
to
her
before
at
moments
her
arm
all
but
brushed
his
sleeve
i
think
he
blessed
the
children
where
are
you
going
the
duchessa
asked
softly
smiling
into
the
girl
sad
little
face
the
girl
had
shown
no
fear
of
peter
but
apparently
she
was
somewhat
frightened
by
this
grand
lady
the
toes
of
her
bare
feet
worked
nervously
in
the
dust
she
hung
her
head
shyly
and
eyed
her
brother
but
the
brother
removing
his
hat
with
the
bow
of
an
italian
peasant
and
that
is
to
say
the
bow
of
a
courtier
spoke
up
bravely
to
turin
he
said
it
in
a
perfectly
way
quite
as
he
might
have
said
to
the
next
the
duchessa
however
had
not
bargained
for
an
answer
of
this
measure
startled
doubting
her
ears
perhaps
to
turin
she
exclaimed
yes
excellency
said
the
boy
but
but
turin
turin
is
hundreds
of
kilometres
from
here
she
said
in
a
kind
of
gasp
yes
excellency
said
the
boy
you
are
going
to
turin
you
two
children
walking
like
that
she
persisted
yes
but
but
it
will
take
you
a
pardon
noble
lady
said
the
boy
with
your
excellency
permission
we
were
told
it
should
take
fifteen
where
do
you
come
from
she
asked
from
bergamo
when
did
you
leave
bergamo
yesterday
morning
the
little
girl
is
your
sister
yes
have
you
a
mother
and
father
a
father
excellency
the
mother
is
each
of
the
children
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
peter
was
somewhat
surprised
no
doubt
to
see
the
duchessa
do
likewise
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
beautiful
custom
of
that
pious
lombard
land
whereby
when
the
dead
are
mentioned
you
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
pausing
reverently
for
a
moment
say
in
silence
the
traditional
prayer
of
the
church
may
their
souls
and
the
souls
of
all
the
faithful
departed
through
the
mercy
of
god
rest
in
and
where
is
your
father
the
duchessa
asked
in
turin
excellency
answered
the
boy
he
is
a
after
the
strike
at
bergamo
he
went
to
turin
to
seek
work
now
he
has
found
it
so
he
has
sent
for
us
to
come
to
and
you
two
children
alone
are
going
to
walk
all
the
way
to
turin
she
could
not
get
over
the
pitiful
wonder
of
it
yes
the
little
waifs
she
said
in
english
with
something
like
a
sob
then
in
italian
but
but
how
do
you
live
by
the
way
the
boy
touched
his
of
baskets
we
sell
these
what
is
their
price
she
asked
thirty
soldi
have
you
sold
many
since
you
started
the
boy
looked
away
and
now
it
was
his
turn
to
hang
his
head
and
to
let
his
toes
work
nervously
in
the
dust
have
you
sold
any
she
exclaimed
drawing
her
conclusions
no
excellency
the
people
would
not
buy
he
owned
in
a
dull
voice
keeping
his
eyes
down
poverino
she
murmured
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
in
a
house
excellency
said
he
but
that
seemed
to
strike
the
duchessa
as
somewhat
vague
in
what
house
she
asked
i
do
not
know
excellency
he
confessed
we
will
find
a
would
you
like
to
come
back
with
me
and
sleep
at
my
house
the
boy
and
girl
looked
at
each
other
taking
mute
counsel
then
pardon
noble
lady
with
your
excellency
permission
is
it
far
the
boy
questioned
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
very
near
three
or
four
again
the
children
looked
at
each
other
conferring
afterwards
the
boy
shook
his
head
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
with
your
permission
we
must
not
turn
back
we
must
walk
on
till
later
at
night
we
will
find
a
they
are
too
proud
to
own
that
their
house
will
be
a
hedge
she
said
to
peter
again
in
english
are
you
hungry
she
asked
the
children
no
excellency
we
had
bread
in
the
village
below
there
answered
the
boy
you
will
not
come
home
with
me
and
have
a
good
dinner
and
a
good
night
sleep
pardon
excellency
with
your
favour
the
father
would
not
wish
us
to
turn
the
duchessa
looked
at
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
wore
a
medal
of
the
immaculate
conception
on
a
ribbon
round
her
neck
a
forlorn
blue
ribbon
soiled
and
frayed
oh
you
have
a
holy
medal
said
the
duchessa
yes
noble
lady
said
the
girl
dropping
a
courtesy
and
lifting
up
her
sad
little
weazened
face
she
has
been
saying
her
prayers
all
along
the
road
the
boy
volunteered
that
is
right
approved
the
duchessa
you
have
not
made
your
first
communion
yet
have
you
no
excellency
said
the
girl
i
shall
make
it
next
and
you
the
duchessa
asked
the
boy
i
made
mine
at
corpus
christi
said
the
boy
with
a
touch
of
pride
the
duchessa
turned
to
peter
do
you
know
i
have
a
penny
in
my
pocket
i
have
come
out
without
my
how
much
ought
one
to
give
them
peter
asked
of
course
there
is
the
fear
that
they
might
be
robbed
she
reflected
if
one
should
give
them
a
note
of
any
value
they
would
have
to
change
it
and
they
would
probably
be
robbed
what
to
do
i
will
speak
to
the
boy
said
peter
would
you
like
to
go
to
turin
by
train
he
asked
the
boy
and
girl
looked
at
each
other
yes
excellency
said
the
boy
but
if
i
give
you
money
for
your
fare
will
you
know
how
to
take
care
of
it
how
to
prevent
people
from
robbing
you
oh
yes
you
could
take
the
train
this
evening
at
venzona
about
two
kilometres
from
here
in
the
direction
you
are
walking
in
an
hour
or
two
you
would
arrive
at
milan
there
you
would
change
into
the
train
for
turin
you
would
be
at
turin
yes
but
if
i
give
you
money
you
will
not
let
people
rob
you
if
i
give
you
a
hundred
lire
the
boy
drew
back
stared
as
if
frightened
a
hundred
lire
he
said
yes
said
peter
the
boy
looked
at
his
sister
pardon
nobility
he
said
with
your
condescension
does
it
cost
a
hundred
lire
to
go
to
turin
by
train
oh
no
i
think
it
costs
eight
or
again
the
boy
looked
at
his
sister
pardon
nobility
with
your
excellency
permission
we
should
not
desire
a
hundred
lire
then
he
said
peter
and
the
duchessa
were
not
altogether
to
be
blamed
i
hope
if
they
exchanged
the
merest
hint
of
a
smile
well
if
i
should
give
you
fifty
peter
asked
fifty
lire
excellency
peter
nodded
still
again
the
boy
sought
counsel
of
his
sister
with
his
eyes
yes
excellency
he
said
you
are
sure
you
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
it
you
will
not
let
people
rob
you
the
duchessa
put
in
anxious
they
will
wish
to
rob
you
if
you
go
to
sleep
in
the
train
they
will
try
to
pick
your
i
will
hide
it
noble
lady
no
one
shall
rob
me
if
i
go
to
sleep
in
the
train
i
will
sit
on
it
and
my
sister
will
watch
if
she
goes
to
sleep
i
will
watch
the
boy
promised
confidently
you
must
give
it
to
him
in
the
smallest
change
you
can
possibly
scrape
together
she
advised
peter
and
with
notes
and
with
a
little
silver
and
copper
he
made
up
the
amount
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
said
the
boy
with
a
bow
that
was
magnificent
and
he
proceeded
to
distribute
the
money
between
various
obscure
pockets
a
thousand
thanks
excellency
said
the
girl
with
a
courtesy
addio
a
buon
viaggio
said
peter
addio
eccellenze
said
the
boy
addio
eccellenze
said
the
girl
but
the
duchessa
impulsively
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
girl
on
her
poor
little
wrinkled
brow
and
when
she
stood
up
peter
saw
that
her
eyes
were
wet
the
children
moved
off
they
moved
off
whispering
together
and
gesticulating
after
the
manner
of
their
race
discussing
something
presently
they
stopped
and
the
boy
came
running
back
while
his
sister
waited
he
doffed
his
hat
and
said
a
thousand
pardons
yes
what
is
it
peter
asked
with
your
excellency
favour
is
it
obligatory
that
we
should
take
the
train
obligatory
puzzled
peter
how
do
you
mean
if
it
is
not
obligatory
we
would
prefer
with
the
permission
of
your
excellency
to
save
the
but
but
then
you
will
have
to
walk
cried
peter
but
if
it
is
not
obligatory
to
take
the
train
we
would
pray
your
excellency
permission
to
save
the
money
we
should
like
to
save
the
money
to
give
it
to
the
father
the
father
is
very
poor
fifty
lire
is
so
this
time
it
was
peter
who
looked
for
counsel
to
the
duchessa
her
eyes
still
bright
with
tears
responded
let
them
do
as
they
no
it
is
not
obligatory
it
is
only
recommended
he
said
to
the
boy
with
a
smile
that
he
could
help
do
as
you
will
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
spare
my
poor
little
mille
grazie
eccellenze
the
boy
said
with
a
final
sweep
of
his
tattered
hat
he
ran
back
to
his
sister
and
next
moment
they
were
walking
resolutely
on
westward
into
the
great
red
the
duchessa
and
peter
were
silent
for
a
while
looking
after
them
they
dwindled
to
dots
in
the
distance
and
then
where
the
road
turned
disappeared
at
last
the
duchessa
spoke
but
almost
as
if
speaking
to
herself
there
felix
wildmay
you
writer
of
tales
is
a
subject
made
to
your
hand
she
said
we
may
guess
whether
peter
was
startled
was
it
possible
that
she
had
found
him
out
a
sound
confused
embarrassed
something
composite
between
an
oh
and
ayes
seemed
to
expire
in
his
throat
but
the
duchessa
did
appear
to
heed
it
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
touching
episode
for
your
friend
to
write
a
story
round
she
asked
we
may
guess
whether
he
was
relieved
oh
oh
yes
he
agreed
with
the
precipitancy
of
a
man
who
in
his
relief
would
agree
to
anything
have
you
ever
seen
such
courage
she
went
on
the
wonderful
babies
fancy
fifteen
days
fifteen
days
and
nights
alone
unprotected
on
the
highway
those
poor
little
atoms
down
in
their
hearts
they
are
really
filled
with
terror
who
would
be
with
such
a
journey
before
him
but
how
finely
they
concealed
it
mastered
it
oh
i
hope
they
wo
be
robbed
god
help
them
god
help
them
god
help
them
indeed
said
peter
and
the
little
girl
with
her
medal
of
the
immaculate
conception
the
father
after
all
can
hardly
be
the
brute
one
might
suspect
since
he
has
given
them
a
religious
education
oh
i
am
sure
i
am
sure
it
was
the
blessed
virgin
herself
who
sent
us
across
their
path
in
answer
to
that
poor
little
creature
yes
said
peter
ambiguously
perhaps
but
he
liked
the
way
in
which
she
united
him
to
herself
in
the
pronoun
which
of
course
she
added
smiling
gravely
into
his
eyes
seems
the
height
of
absurdity
to
you
why
should
it
seem
the
height
of
absurdity
to
me
he
asked
you
are
a
protestant
i
suppose
i
suppose
so
but
what
of
that
at
all
events
i
believe
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
the
usual
philosophies
and
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
the
blessed
virgin
who
sent
us
across
their
what
would
your
protestant
pastors
and
masters
do
if
they
heard
you
is
that
what
they
call
popish
superstition
i
daresay
but
i
not
sure
that
there
any
such
thing
as
superstition
superstition
in
its
essence
is
merely
a
recognition
of
the
truth
that
in
a
universe
of
mysteries
and
contradictions
like
ours
nothing
conceivable
or
inconceivable
is
oh
no
no
she
objected
superstition
is
the
belief
in
something
that
is
ugly
and
bad
and
unmeaning
that
is
the
difference
between
superstition
and
religion
religion
is
the
belief
in
something
that
is
beautiful
and
good
and
significant
something
that
throws
light
into
the
dark
places
of
life
that
helps
us
to
see
and
to
yes
said
peter
i
admit
the
after
a
little
suspension
i
thought
he
questioned
that
all
catholics
were
required
to
go
to
mass
on
sunday
of
course
so
they
are
said
she
but
but
you
he
began
i
hear
mass
not
on
sunday
only
i
hear
it
every
morning
of
my
oh
indeed
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stumbled
i
one
one
never
sees
you
at
the
village
no
we
have
a
chapel
and
a
chaplain
at
the
she
mounted
her
bicycle
she
said
and
lightly
rode
away
her
bigotry
is
not
such
a
negligible
quantity
after
all
peter
concluded
but
what
he
demanded
of
marietta
as
she
ministered
to
his
wants
at
dinner
what
does
one
barrier
more
or
less
matter
when
people
are
already
divided
by
a
gulf
that
never
can
be
traversed
you
see
that
river
he
pointed
through
his
open
window
to
the
aco
it
is
a
symbol
she
stands
on
one
side
of
it
i
stand
on
the
other
and
we
exchange
little
jokes
but
the
river
is
always
there
flowing
between
us
separating
us
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
lord
and
the
widow
of
a
duke
and
the
fairest
of
her
sex
and
a
millionaire
and
a
roman
catholic
what
am
i
oh
i
do
deny
i
clever
but
for
the
rest
my
dear
marietta
i
am
simply
in
one
word
the
victim
of
a
misplaced
non
capisco
francese
said
marietta
xiv
and
after
that
for
i
forget
how
many
days
peter
and
the
duchessa
did
not
meet
and
so
he
sank
low
and
lower
in
his
mind
nothing
that
can
befall
us
optimists
aver
is
without
its
value
and
this
i
have
heard
is
especially
true
if
we
happen
to
be
literary
men
all
is
grist
that
comes
to
a
writer
mill
by
his
present
experience
accordingly
peter
learned
and
in
the
regretful
prose
of
some
future
masterpiece
will
perhaps
be
enabled
to
remember
how
exceeding
great
is
the
impatience
of
the
lovesick
with
what
febrile
vehemence
the
smitten
heart
can
burn
and
to
what
improbable
lengths
hours
and
minutes
can
on
occasions
stretch
themselves
he
tried
many
methods
of
distraction
there
was
always
the
panorama
of
his
valley
the
lake
pale
monte
sfiorito
the
frowning
gnisi
the
smiling
uplands
westward
there
were
always
the
sky
the
clouds
the
clear
sunshine
the
shadows
and
in
the
afternoon
there
was
always
the
wondrous
opalescent
haze
of
august
filling
every
distance
there
was
always
his
garden
there
were
the
great
trees
with
the
light
sifting
through
high
spaces
of
feathery
green
there
were
the
flowers
the
birds
the
bees
the
butterflies
with
their
colour
and
their
fragrance
and
their
music
there
was
his
tinkling
fountain
in
its
nimbus
of
prismatic
spray
there
was
the
swift
symbolic
aco
and
then
at
a
walk
there
was
the
pretty
village
with
its
church
its
odd
little
shrines
its
ossuary
its
faded
frescoed
its
busy
vociferous
italian
life
the
cobbler
tapping
in
his
stall
women
gossiping
at
their
toilets
children
sprawling
in
the
dirt
chasing
each
other
shouting
men
drinking
playing
mora
quarrelling
laughing
singing
twanging
mandolines
at
the
tables
under
the
withered
bush
of
the
and
two
or
three
more
pensive
citizens
swinging
their
legs
from
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
angling
for
fish
that
never
bit
in
the
impetuous
stream
below
peter
looked
at
these
things
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
he
saw
them
but
for
all
the
joy
they
gave
him
he
this
cultivator
of
the
sense
of
beauty
might
have
been
the
basest
unit
of
his
own
purblind
public
they
were
the
background
for
an
absent
figure
they
were
the
of
a
drama
whose
action
was
arrested
they
were
an
empty
theatre
he
tried
to
read
he
had
brought
a
trunkful
of
books
to
villa
floriano
but
that
book
had
been
left
behind
which
could
fix
his
interest
now
he
tried
to
write
and
wondered
in
a
kind
of
daze
that
any
man
should
ever
have
felt
the
faintest
ambition
to
do
a
thing
so
thankless
and
so
futile
i
shall
never
write
again
writing
he
generalised
and
possibly
not
without
some
reason
when
it
is
the
sordidest
of
trades
is
a
mere
fatuous
assertion
of
one
egotism
breaking
stones
in
the
street
were
a
nobler
occupation
weaving
ropes
of
sand
were
better
sport
the
only
things
that
are
worth
writing
are
inexpressible
and
ca
be
written
the
only
things
that
can
be
written
are
obvious
and
worthless
the
very
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
oh
why
does
she
turn
up
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
at
any
moment
for
aught
he
knew
she
might
turn
up
that
was
the
worst
of
it
and
the
best
it
kept
hope
alive
only
to
torture
hope
it
encouraged
him
to
wait
to
watch
to
expect
to
linger
in
his
garden
gazing
up
the
lawns
of
ventirose
striving
to
pierce
the
foliage
that
embowered
the
castle
to
wander
the
country
scanning
every
vista
scrutinising
every
shape
and
shadow
a
gastibelza
at
any
moment
indeed
she
might
turn
up
but
the
days
passed
the
hypocritic
days
and
she
did
not
turn
up
marietta
the
kind
soul
noticing
his
despondency
sought
in
divers
artless
ways
to
cheer
him
one
evening
she
burst
into
his
with
the
effect
of
a
small
explosion
excitement
in
every
line
of
her
brown
old
face
and
wiry
little
figure
the
fireflies
the
fireflies
signorino
she
cried
with
strenuous
gestures
what
fireflies
asked
he
with
phlegm
it
is
the
feast
of
dominic
the
fireflies
have
arrived
they
arrive
every
year
on
the
feast
of
dominic
they
are
the
beads
of
his
rosary
they
are
dominic
aves
there
are
thousands
of
them
come
signorino
come
and
her
black
eyes
snapped
she
waved
her
hands
urgently
towards
the
window
peter
languidly
got
up
languidly
crossed
the
room
looked
out
there
were
in
truth
thousands
of
them
thousands
and
thousands
of
tiny
primrose
flames
circling
fluttering
rising
sinking
in
the
purple
blackness
of
the
night
like
snowflakes
in
a
wind
palpitating
like
hearts
of
living
gold
jove
descending
upon
danae
invisible
son
carin
eh
cried
eager
marietta
hum
yes
pretty
enough
he
grudgingly
acknowledged
but
even
so
the
ingrate
added
as
he
turned
away
and
let
himself
drop
back
into
his
my
dear
good
woman
no
amount
of
prettiness
can
disguise
the
fundamental
banality
of
things
your
fireflies
dominic
beads
if
you
like
and
apropos
of
that
do
you
know
what
they
call
them
in
america
they
call
them
if
you
can
believe
me
remark
the
difference
between
southern
euphuism
and
western
bluntness
your
fireflies
are
pretty
enough
i
grant
but
they
are
tinsel
pasted
on
the
desert
of
sahara
they
are
condiments
added
to
a
dinner
of
dust
and
ashes
life
trick
it
out
as
you
will
is
just
an
incubus
is
just
the
old
man
of
the
sea
language
fails
me
to
convey
to
you
any
notion
how
heavily
he
sits
on
my
poor
shoulders
i
thought
i
had
suffered
from
ennui
in
my
youth
but
the
malady
merely
plays
with
the
green
fruit
it
reserves
its
serious
ravages
for
the
ripe
i
can
promise
you
is
not
a
laughing
matter
have
you
ever
had
a
fixed
idea
have
you
ever
spent
days
and
nights
racking
your
brain
importuning
the
unanswering
powers
to
learn
whether
there
was
well
whether
there
was
another
man
for
instance
oh
bring
me
drink
bring
me
seltzer
water
and
vermouth
i
will
seek
nepenthe
at
the
bottom
of
the
was
there
another
man
why
should
there
not
be
and
yet
was
there
in
her
continued
absence
the
question
came
back
persistently
and
scarcely
contributed
to
his
peace
of
mind
a
few
days
later
nothing
discouraged
would
you
like
to
have
a
good
laugh
signorino
marietta
enquired
yes
he
answered
apathetic
then
do
me
the
favour
to
come
she
said
she
led
him
out
of
his
garden
to
the
gate
of
a
neighbouring
meadow
a
beautiful
white
cow
stood
there
her
head
over
the
bars
looking
up
and
down
the
road
and
now
and
then
uttering
a
low
distressful
see
her
said
marietta
i
see
her
well
said
peter
this
morning
they
took
her
calf
from
her
to
wean
it
said
marietta
did
they
the
cruel
things
well
said
he
and
ever
since
she
has
stood
there
by
the
gate
looking
down
the
road
waiting
the
poor
dear
well
said
he
but
do
you
not
see
signorino
look
at
her
eyes
she
is
weeping
weeping
like
a
peter
sure
enough
from
the
poor
cow
eyes
tears
were
falling
steadily
rapidly
big
limpid
tears
that
trickled
down
her
cheek
her
great
homely
hairy
cheek
and
dropped
on
the
grass
tears
of
helpless
pain
uncomprehending
endurance
why
have
they
done
this
thing
to
me
they
seemed
dumbly
to
cry
have
you
ever
seen
a
cow
weep
before
is
it
comical
at
least
demanded
marietta
exultant
comical
peter
gasped
comical
he
groaned
but
then
he
spoke
to
the
cow
poor
dear
poor
dear
he
repeated
he
patted
her
soft
warm
neck
and
scratched
her
between
the
horns
and
along
the
dewlap
poor
dear
poor
the
cow
lifted
up
her
head
and
rested
her
great
chin
on
shoulder
breathing
upon
his
face
yes
you
know
that
we
are
companions
in
misery
do
you
he
said
they
have
taken
my
calf
from
me
too
though
my
calf
indeed
was
only
a
calf
in
an
extremely
metaphorical
sense
and
it
never
was
exactly
mine
anyhow
i
daresay
it
belonged
from
the
beginning
to
another
man
you
at
least
have
that
gall
and
wormwood
added
to
your
cup
and
now
you
must
really
try
to
pull
yourself
together
it
no
good
crying
and
besides
there
are
more
calves
in
the
sea
than
have
ever
been
taken
from
it
you
have
a
much
handsomer
and
fatter
one
next
time
and
besides
you
must
remember
that
your
loss
subserves
someone
else
gain
the
farmer
would
never
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
to
his
advantage
if
you
an
altruist
that
should
comfort
you
and
you
must
mind
marietta
you
must
mind
her
laughter
marietta
is
a
latin
the
latin
conception
of
what
is
laughable
differs
by
the
whole
span
of
heaven
from
the
teuton
you
and
i
are
teutons
questioned
marietta
wrinkling
her
brow
yes
germanic
said
he
but
i
thought
the
signorino
was
english
so
he
but
the
cow
is
not
germanic
white
with
black
horns
that
is
the
purest
roman
breed
fa
niente
he
instructed
her
cows
and
englishmen
and
all
such
sentimental
cattle
including
germans
are
germanic
italians
are
latin
with
a
touch
of
the
goth
and
vandal
lions
and
tigers
growl
and
fight
because
they
mohammedans
dogs
still
bear
without
abuse
the
grand
old
name
of
sycophant
cats
are
of
the
princely
line
of
persia
and
worship
fire
fish
and
flattery
as
you
may
have
noticed
geese
belong
indifferently
to
any
race
you
like
they
are
cosmopolitans
and
i
known
here
and
there
a
person
who
without
distinction
of
nationality
was
a
duck
in
fact
you
rather
by
way
of
being
a
duck
yourself
and
now
he
perorated
never
deny
again
that
i
can
talk
nonsense
with
an
aching
all
the
same
insisted
marietta
it
is
very
comical
to
see
a
cow
at
any
rate
retorted
peter
it
is
not
in
the
least
comical
to
hear
a
hyaena
i
have
never
heard
one
said
she
pray
that
you
never
may
the
sound
would
make
an
old
woman
of
you
quite
davvero
said
marietta
davvero
he
assured
her
and
meanwhile
the
cow
stood
there
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
silently
weeping
weeping
he
gave
her
a
farewell
rub
along
the
nose
he
said
your
breath
is
like
meadowsweet
so
dry
your
tears
and
set
your
hopes
upon
the
future
i
come
and
see
you
again
and
i
bring
you
some
nice
coarse
salt
but
when
he
went
to
see
her
on
the
morrow
she
was
grazing
peacefully
and
she
ate
the
salt
he
brought
her
with
bovine
relish
putting
out
her
soft
white
pad
of
a
tongue
licking
it
deliberately
from
his
hand
savouring
it
tranquilly
and
crunching
the
bigger
grains
with
ruminative
enjoyment
between
her
teeth
so
soon
consoled
they
were
companions
in
misery
no
longer
i
afraid
you
are
a
latin
after
all
he
said
and
left
her
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
that
afternoon
marietta
asked
would
you
care
to
visit
the
castle
signorino
he
was
seated
under
his
by
the
river
smoking
cigarettes
burning
superfluous
time
marietta
pointed
towards
ventirose
why
said
he
the
family
are
away
in
the
absence
of
the
family
the
public
are
admitted
upon
presentation
of
their
oho
he
cried
so
the
family
are
away
are
they
yes
aha
cried
he
the
family
are
away
that
explains
everything
have
have
they
been
gone
long
since
a
week
ten
days
a
week
ten
days
he
started
up
indignant
you
secretive
wretch
why
have
you
never
breathed
a
word
of
this
to
me
marietta
looked
rather
frightened
i
did
not
know
it
myself
signorino
was
her
meek
apology
i
heard
it
in
the
village
this
morning
when
the
signorino
sent
me
to
buy
coarse
oh
i
he
sank
back
upon
his
rustic
bench
you
are
he
extended
his
hand
in
sign
of
absolution
are
they
ever
coming
back
naturally
what
makes
you
think
so
but
they
will
naturally
come
i
felicitate
you
upon
your
simple
faith
when
oh
fra
poco
they
have
gone
to
to
rome
you
trifling
with
me
people
do
not
go
to
rome
in
pardon
signorino
people
go
to
rome
for
the
feast
of
the
assumption
that
is
the
afterwards
they
come
back
said
marietta
firmly
i
withdraw
my
protest
said
peter
they
have
gone
to
rome
for
the
feast
of
the
assumption
afterwards
they
will
come
precisely
signorino
but
you
have
now
the
right
to
visit
the
castle
upon
presentation
of
your
card
you
address
yourself
to
the
porter
at
the
lodge
the
castle
is
grand
magnificent
the
court
of
honour
alone
is
thirty
metres
marietta
stretched
her
hands
to
right
and
left
as
far
as
they
would
go
marietta
peter
enquired
solemnly
are
you
familiar
with
the
tragedy
of
marietta
blinked
no
you
have
never
read
it
he
pursued
in
that
famous
edition
from
which
the
character
of
the
prince
of
denmark
happened
to
be
omitted
marietta
shook
her
head
wearily
patiently
wearily
patiently
no
signorino
she
replied
neither
have
i
said
he
and
i
do
desire
marietta
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
returned
gallantly
to
her
charge
if
you
would
care
to
visit
the
castle
signorino
you
could
see
the
crypt
which
contains
the
tombs
of
the
family
of
farfalla
the
former
owners
they
are
of
black
marble
and
alabaster
with
gilding
very
rich
you
could
also
see
the
many
years
ago
a
tun
there
burst
and
a
serving
man
was
drowned
in
the
wine
you
could
also
see
the
bed
in
which
nabulione
the
emperor
of
europe
slept
when
he
was
in
this
country
also
the
ancient
kitchen
many
years
ago
in
a
storm
the
skeleton
of
a
man
fell
down
the

out
upon
the
hearth
also
what
is
called
the
court
of
foxes
many
years
ago
there
was
a
plague
of
foxes
and
the
foxes
came
down
from
the
forest
like
a
great
army
thousands
of
them
and
the
lords
of
the
castle
and
the
peasants
and
the
village
people
all
all
had
to
run
away
like
rabbits
or
the
foxes
would
have
eaten
them
it
was
in
what
they
call
the
court
of
foxes
that
the
king
of
the
foxes
held
his
court
there
is
also

peter
demanded
tragically
when
marietta
had
brought
her
exposition
to
a
close
let
me
impress
upon
you
once
for
all
that
i
am
not
a
tripper
as
for
your
castle
you
invite
me
to
a
deserted
as
for
your
park
i
see
quite
as
much
of
it
as
i
wish
to
see
from
the
seclusion
of
my
own
pleached
garden
i
learned
long
ago
the
folly
of
investigating
things
too
closely
the
wisdom
of
leaving
things
in
the
vague
at
present
the
park
of
ventirose
provides
me
with
the
raw
material
for
it
is
a
sort
of
country
i
can
see
just
so
far
into
it
and
no
farther
that
lies
beyond
is
mystery
is
potentiality
terra
incognita
which
i
can
populate
with
monsters
or
pleasant
phantoms
at
my
whim
why
should
you
attempt
to
deprive
me
of
so
innocent
a
recreation
after
the
return
of
the
family
said
marietta
the
public
will
no
longer
be
admitted
meantime
upon
presentation
of
my
card
the
porter
will
conduct
me
from
disenchantment
to
disenchantment
no
thank
you
now
if
it
were
the
other
way
round
it
would
be
different
if
it
were
the
castle
and
the
park
that
had
gone
to
rome
and
if
the
family
could
be
visited
on
presentation
of
my
card
i
might
be
but
that
would
be
impossible

beatrice
walking
with
a
priest
ay
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
conspiring
with
a
priest
but
you
shall
judge
they
were
in
a
room
of
the
palazzo
udeschini
at
rome
a
reception
room
on
the
piano
nobile
therefore
you
see
it
for
are
not
all
in
roman
palaces
alike
vast
lofty
sombre
the
walls

with

a
pattern
of

and

and
there
a

dark

a

a

on

dark
pieces
of

dark
and
heavy
and
tall
windows
bare
of
curtains
at
this
season
opening
upon
a
court
a
wide
court
planted
with
in
the
midst
of
which
a
brown
old
fountain
indefatigable
played
its
sibilant
monotone
in
the
streets
there
were
the
smells
the
noises
the
heat
the
glare
of
august
of
august
in
rome
the
most
roman
of
the
months
they
say
certainly
the
hottest
noisiest
noisomest
and
most
glaring
but
here
all
was
shadow
coolness
stillness
fragrance
of
the
clean
air
coming
in
from
among
the
beatrice
stood
before
a
between
two
of
the
tall
windows
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
craning
her
neck
a
little
examining
if
i
must
confess
it
the
effect
of
a
new
hat
it
was
a
very
stunning
hat
if
a
man
opinion
hath
any
pertinence
it
was
beyond
doubt
very
complicated
there
was
an
black
brim
there
was
a
black
feather
there
was
a
defiant
white
aigrette
not
unlike
the
shah
of
persia
there
were
glints
of
red
the
priest
sat
in
an
one
of
those
stiff
upright
roman
which
no
one
would
ever
dream
of
calling
covered
with
hard
leather
studded
with
steel
nails
and
watched
her
smiling
amusement
indulgence
he
was
an
oldish
priest
sixty
he
was
small
lightly
built
with
features
a
prominent
delicate
nose
a
delicate
ending
in
a
prominent
delicate
chin
a
large
humorous
mouth
the
full
lips
delicately
chiselled
a
high
delicate
perhaps
rather
narrow
brow
rising
above
humorous
grey
eyes
rather
then
he
had
smooth
white
hair
and
topping
the
occiput
a
tonsure
that
might
have
passed
for
a
natural
bald
spot
he
was
decidedly
he
was
but
he
was
above
all
he
wore
a
plain
black
cassock
by
no
means
in
its
first
youth
brown
along
the
seams
and
at
the
salient
angles
at
the
shoulders
at
the
elbows
shining
with
the
lustre
of
hard
service
even
without
his
cassock
i
imagine
you
would
have
divined
him
for
a
clergyman
he
bore
the
clerical
impress
that
odd
indefinable
air
of
clericism
which
everyone
recognises
though
it
might
not
be
altogether
easy
to
tell
just
where
or
from
what
it
takes
its
origin
in
the
garb
of
an
anglican
there
being
nothing
at
first
blush
necessarily
italian
necessarily
in
his
face
he
would
have
struck
you
i
think
as
a
pleasant
shrewd
old
parson
of
the
scholarly
earnest
type
mildly
donnish
with
a
fondness
for
gentle
mirth
what
however
you
would
scarcely
have
divined
unless
you
had
chanced
to
notice
inconspicuous
in
this
sober
light
the
red
sash
round
his
waist
or
the
amethyst
on
the
third
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
his
rank
in
the
roman
hierarchy
i
have
the
honour
of
presenting
his
eminence
egidio
maria
cardinal
udeschini
formerly
bishop
of
cittareggio
prefect
of
the
congregation
of
archives
and
inscriptions
that
was
his
title
ecclesiastical
he
had
two
other
titles
he
was
a
prince
of
the
udeschini
by
accident
of
birth
but
his
third
title
was
perhaps
his
most
curious
it
had
been
conferred
upon
him
informally
by
the
populace
of
the
roman
slum
in
which
his
titular
church
mary
of
the
lilies
was
situated
the
little
uncle
of
the
poor
as
italians
measure
wealth
cardinal
udeschini
was
a
wealthy
man
what
with
his
private
fortune
and
official
stipends
he
commanded
an
income
of
something
like
a
hundred
thousand
lire
he
allowed
himself
five
thousand
lire
a
year
for
food
clothing
and
general
expenses
lodging
and
service
he
had
for
nothing
in
the
palace
of
his
family
the
remaining
thousand
lire
of
his
budget
well
we
all
know
that
titles
can
be
purchased
in
italy
and
that
was
no
doubt
the
price
he
paid
for
the
title
i
have
mentioned
however
it
was
not
in
money
only
that
cardinal
udeschim
paid
he
paid
also
in
labour
i
have
said
that
his
titular
church
was
in
a
slum
rome
surely
contained
no
slum
more
fetid
none
more
perilous
a
region
of
alleys
south
of
the
ghetto
along
the
tiber
bank
night
after
night
accompanied
by
his
stout
young
vicar
don
giorgio
appolloni
the
cardinal
worked
there
as
hard
as
any
curate
visiting
the
sick
comforting
the
afflicted
admonishing
the
knavish
persuading
the
drunken
from
their
taverns
making
peace
between
the
combative
not
infrequently
when
he
came
home
he
would
add
a
pair
of
stilettos
to
his
already
large
collection
of
such
relics
and
his
homecomings
were
apt
to
be
late
oftener
than
not
after
midnight
and
sometimes
indeed
in
the
vague
twilight
of
morning
at
the
hour
when
as
he
once
expressed
it
to
don
giorgio
the
tired
burglar
is
just
lying
down
to
and
every
saturday
evening
the
cardinal
prefect
of
archives
and
inscriptions
sat
for
three
hours
boxed
up
in
his
confessional
like
any
parish
priest
in
his
confessional
at
mary
of
the
lilies
where
the
penitents
who
breathed
their
secrets
into
his
ears
and
received
his
fatherly
counsels
i
beg
your
pardon
one
must
not
of
course
remember
his
rags
or
his
sores
when
lazarus
approaches
that
tribunal
but
i
do
pretend
that
the
cardinal
was
a
saint
i
am
sure
he
was
not
a
prig
for
all
his
works
of
supererogation
his
life
was
a
life
of
pomp
and
luxury
compared
to
the
proper
saint
life
he
wore
no
hair
shirt
i
doubt
if
he
knew
the
taste
of
the
discipline
he
had
his
weaknesses
his
foibles
even
if
you
will
his
vices
i
have
intimated
that
he
was
fond
of
a
jest
the
sacred
college
i
heard
him
remark
one
day
has
fifty
centres
of
gravity
i
sometimes
fear
that
i
am
its
centre
of
he
was
also
fond
of
music
he
was
also
fond
of
snuff
is
an
abominable
habit
he
admitted
i
ca
tolerate
it
at
all
in
others
when
i
was
bishop
of
cittareggio
i
discountenanced
it
utterly
among
my
clergy
but
for
myself
i
need
not
say
there
are
special
circumstances
oddly
enough
by
the
bye
at
cittareggio
each
separate
member
of
my
clergy
was
able
to
plead
special
circumstances
for
himself
i
have
tried
to
give
it
up
and
the
effort
has
spoiled
my
temper
turned
me
into
a
perfect
old
shrew
for
my
friends
sake
therefore
i
appease
myself
with
an
occasional
pinch
you
see
tobacco
is
antiseptic
it
an
excellent
preservative
of
the
milk
of
human
the
friends
in
question
kept
him
supplied
with
sound
rappee
jests
and
music
he
was
abundantly
competent
to
supply
himself
he
played
the
piano
and
the
organ
and
he
sang
in
a
clear
sweet
slightly
faded
tenor
of
secular
composers
his
favourites
were
the
lucid
scarlatti
the
luminous
but
the
music
that
roused
him
to
enthusiasm
was
gregorian
he
would
have
none
other
at
mary
of
the
lilies
he
had
trained
his
priests
and
his
people
there
to
sing
it
admirably
you
should
have
heard
them
sing
vespers
and
he
sang
it
admirably
himself
you
should
have
heard
him
sing
a
mass
you
should
have
heard
that
sweet
old
tenor
voice
of
his
in
the
preface
and
the
pater
noster
so
then
beatrice
stood
before
a
and
studied
her
new
hat
whilst
the
cardinal
amused
indulgent
sat
in
his
armchair
and
watched
her
well
what
do
you
think
she
asked
turning
towards
him
you
appeal
to
me
as
an
expert
he
questioned
his
as
well
as
his
was
sweet
but
with
a
kind
of
trenchant
edge
upon
it
a
genial
asperity
that
gave
it
character
tang
as
one
who
should
certainly
be
able
to
advise
said
she
well
then
said
he
he
took
his
chin
into
his
hand
as
if
it
were
a
beard
and
looked
up
at
her
considering
and
the
lines
of
amusement
the
parentheses
deepened
at
either
side
of
his
mouth
well
then
i
think
if
the
feather
were
to
be
lifted
a
little
higher
in
front
and
brought
down
a
little
lower
behind
good
gracious
i
do
mean
my
hat
cried
beatrice
what
in
the
world
can
an
old
dear
like
you
know
about
hats
there
was
a
further
deepening
of
the
parentheses
surely
he
contended
a
cardinal
should
know
much
is
it
not
badge
of
all
our
tribe
as
your
poet
byron
says
beatrice
laughed
then
byron
she
doubted
with
a
look
the
cardinal
waved
his
hand
a
gesture
of
amiable
concession
oh
if
you
prefer
shakespeare
everything
in
english
is
one
or
the
other
we
will
not
fall
out
like
the
morellists
over
an
attribution
the
point
is
that
i
should
be
a
good
judge
of
he
took
snuff
it
a
shame
you
have
a
decent
beatrice
observed
with
an
eye
on
the
enamelled
wooden
one
cheap
and
shabby
from
which
he
helped
himself
the
box
is
but
the
the
snuff
the
was
it
shakespeare
or
byron
who
said
that
enquired
the
cardinal
beatrice
laughed
again
i
think
it
must
have
been
pulcinella
i
give
you
a
lovely
silver
one
if
you
accept
will
you
really
asked
the
cardinal
alert
of
course
i
will
it
a
shame
you
have
one
what
would
a
lovely
silver
one
cost
he
asked
i
do
know
it
does
matter
answered
she
but
approximately
more
or
less
he
pursued
oh
a
couple
of
hundred
lire
more
or
less
i
a
couple
of
hundred
lire
he
glanced
up
alerter
do
you
happen
to
have
that
amount
of
money
on
your
person
beatrice
the
unwary
woman
hunted
for
her
pocket
took
out
her
purse
computed
its
contents
yes
she
innocently
answered
the
cardinal
chuckled
the
satisfied
chuckle
of
one
whose
unsuspected
tactics
have
succeeded
then
give
me
the
couple
of
hundred
he
put
forth
his
hand
but
beatrice
held
back
what
for
she
asked
suspicion
waking
oh
i
shall
have
uses
for
his
outstretched
hand
a
slim
old
tapering
bony
hand
in
colour
like
dusky
ivory
closed
peremptorily
in
a
of
receiving
and
now
by
the
bye
you
could
not
have
failed
to
notice
the
big
lucent
amethyst
in
its
setting
of
pale
gold
on
the
third
finger
come
give
he
insisted
imperative
rueful
but
resigned
beatrice
shook
her
head
you
have
caught
me
finely
she
sighed
and
gave
you
should
have
jingled
your
purse
you
should
have
flaunted
your
wealth
in
my
face
laughed
the
cardinal
putting
away
the
notes
he
took
snuff
again
i
think
i
honestly
earned
that
pinch
he
murmured
at
any
rate
said
beatrice
laying
what
unction
she
could
to
her
soul
i
am
acquainted
with
a
dignitary
of
the
church
who
has
lost
a
handsome
silver
snuffbox
beautiful
repousse
work
with
his
arms
engraved
on
the
and
i
retaliated
he
i
am
acquainted
with
a
old
doctor
and
his
wife
in
trastevere
who
shall
have
meat
and
wine
at
dinner
for
the
next
two
months
at
the
expense
of
a
niece
of
mine
am
so
glad
as
alice
of
wonderland
says
you
married
into
our
family
alice
of
wonderland
doubted
beatrice
the
cardinal
waved
his
hand
oh
if
you
prefer
punch
everything
in
english
is
one
or
the
beatrice
laughed
it
was
the
i
of
which
especially
surprised
my
english
ear
she
explained
i
am
your
debtor
for
two
hundred
lire
i
can
not
quarrel
with
you
over
a
particle
said
he
but
why
asked
she
why
did
you
give
yourself
such
superfluous
pains
why
could
you
ask
me
for
the
money
why
lure
it
from
me
by
trick
and
device
the
cardinal
chuckled
ah
one
must
keep
one
hand
in
and
one
must
not
look
like
a
jesuit
for
do
you
look
like
a
jesuit
i
have
been
told
by
whom
for
mercy
sake
by
a
gentleman
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
not
long
ago
in
the
train
a
very
gorgeous
gentleman
with
gold
chains
and
diamonds
flashing
from
every
corner
of
his
person
and
a
splendid
waxed
moustache
and
a
bald
head
which
i
think
was
made
of
polished
pink
coral
he
turned
to
me
in
the
most
affable
manner
and
said
see
reverend
sir
that
you
are
a
jesuit
there
should
be
a
between
you
and
me
i
am
a
jew
jews
and
jesuits
have
an
almost
equally
bad
name
the
cardinal
humorous
grey
eyes
swam
in
a
glow
of
delighted
merriment
i
could
have
hugged
him
for
his
i
have
been
wondering
ever
since
whether
in
his
mind
it
was
the
jews
or
the
jesuits
who
benefited
by
that
reservation
i
have
been
wondering
also
what
i
ought
to
have
what
did
you
reply
asked
beatrice
curious
no
no
said
the
cardinal
with
sentiments
of
the
highest
consideration
i
must
respectfully
decline
to
tell
you
it
was
too
flat
i
am
humiliated
whenever
i
recall
you
might
have
replied
that
the
jews
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
meriting
their
bad
name
she
suggested
oh
my
dear
child
objected
he
my
reply
was
flat
you
would
have
had
it
sharp
i
should
have
hurt
the
poor
man
feelings
and
perhaps
have
burdened
my
own
soul
with
a
falsehood
into
the
bargain
who
are
we
to
judge
whether
people
merit
their
bad
name
or
not
no
no
the
humiliating
circumstance
is
that
if
i
had
possessed
the
substance
as
well
as
the
show
if
i
had
really
been
a
son
of
ignatius
i
should
have
found
a
retort
that
would
have
effected
the
and
apropos
of
conversions
said
beatrice
see
how
far
we
have
strayed
from
our
our
muttons
the
cardinal
looked
up
enquiring
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
not
of
my
hat
but
of
my
oh
ah
yes
your
englishman
your
the
cardinal
nodded
my
englishman
my
tenant
my
heretic
said
she
well
said
he
pondering
while
the
parentheses
became
marked
again
i
should
think
from
what
you
tell
me
that
you
would
find
him
a
useful
neighbour
let
me
see
you
got
fifty
lire
out
of
him
for
a
word
and
the
children
went
off
blessing
you
as
their
benefactress
i
should
think
that
you
would
find
him
a
valuable
neighbour
and
that
he
on
his
side
might
find
you
an
expensive
beatrice
with
a
gesture
implored
him
to
be
serious
ah
please
do
tease
about
this
she
said
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
of
his
conversion
the
conversion
of
a
heretic
is
always
consummation
devoutly
to
be
desired
as
well
you
may
settle
it
between
shakespeare
and
byron
to
suit
yourself
and
there
are
none
so
devoutly
desirous
of
such
consummations
as
you
catholics
of
england
especially
you
women
it
is
said
that
a
catholic
englishwoman
once
tried
to
convert
the
well
there
have
been
popes
whom
it
would
have
hurt
commented
beatrice
and
as
for
marchdale
she
continued
he
has
shown
he
admitted
that
he
could
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
our
blessed
lady
who
sent
us
to
the
children
aid
surely
from
a
protestant
that
is
an
extraordinary
admission
yes
said
the
cardinal
and
if
he
meant
it
one
may
conclude
that
he
has
a
philosophic
if
he
meant
it
beatrice
cried
why
should
he
not
have
meant
it
why
should
he
have
said
it
if
he
did
not
mean
it
oh
do
ask
me
protested
the
cardinal
there
is
a
thing
the
french
call
politesse
i
can
conceive
a
young
man
professing
to
agree
with
a
lady
for
the
sake
of
what
the
french
might
call
her
beaux
i
give
you
my
word
said
beatrice
that
my
beaux
yeux
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
he
said
it
in
the
most
absolute
good
faith
he
said
he
believed
that
in
a
universe
like
ours
nothing
was
impossible
that
there
were
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
people
generally
dreamed
of
that
he
could
see
no
reason
why
the
blessed
virgin
should
not
have
sent
us
across
the
children
path
oh
he
meant
it
i
am
perfectly
sure
he
meant
the
cardinal
smiled
at
her
eagerness
perhaps
well
then
he
repeated
we
must
conclude
that
he
has
a
philosophic
but
what
is
one
to
do
asked
she
surely
one
ought
to
do
something
one
ought
to
follow
such
an
admission
up
when
a
man
is
so
far
on
the
way
to
the
light
it
is
surely
one
duty
to
lead
him
farther
without
doubt
said
the
cardinal
well
what
can
one
do
the
cardinal
looked
grave
one
can
pray
he
said
emilia
and
i
pray
for
his
conversion
night
and
that
is
good
he
approved
but
that
is
surely
not
enough
one
can
have
masses
monsignor
langshawe
at
the
castle
says
a
mass
for
him
twice
a
that
is
good
approved
the
cardinal
but
is
that
enough
why
does
monsignor
langshawe
call
upon
him
cultivate
his
acquaintance
talk
with
him
set
him
thinking
the
cardinal
enquired
oh
monsignor
langshawe
beatrice
sighed
with
a
gesture
he
is
interested
in
nothing
but
geology
he
would
talk
to
him
of
nothing
but
moraines
he
would
set
him
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
march
of
hum
said
the
cardinal
well
then
questioned
beatrice
well
then
carissima
why
do
you
not
take
the
affair
in
hand
yourself
but
that
is
just
the
difficulty
what
can
i
what
can
a
mere
woman
do
in
such
a
case
the
cardinal
looked
into
his
amethyst
as
a
into
his
crystal
and
the
lines
about
his
humorous
old
mouth
deepened
and
quivered
i
will
lend
you
the
works
of
bellarmine
in
i
forget
how
many
volumes
you
can
prime
yourself
with
them
and
then
invite
your
heretic
to
a
course
of
oh
i
wish
you
would
turn
it
to
a
joke
said
beatrice
bellarmine
a
joke
exclaimed
the
cardinal
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
heard
him
called
so
however
i
will
not
press
the
but
then
oh
please
advise
me
seriously
what
can
i
do
what
can
a
mere
unlearned
woman
do
the
cardinal
took
snuff
he
gazed
into
his
amethyst
again
beaming
at
it
as
if
he
could
descry
something
deliciously
comical
in
its
depths
he
gave
a
soft
little
laugh
at
last
he
looked
up
well
he
responded
slowly
in
an
extremity
i
should
think
that
a
mere
unlearned
woman
might
if
she
made
an
effort
ask
the
heretic
to
dinner
i
come
down
and
stay
with
you
for
a
day
or
two
and
you
can
ask
him
to
you
a
perfect
old
darling
cried
beatrice
with
rapture
never
be
able
to
resist
oh
i
not
undertaking
to
discuss
theology
with
him
said
the
cardinal
but
one
must
do
something
in
exchange
for
a
couple
of
hundred
lire
so
i
come
and
give
you
my
moral
you
shall
have
your
lovely
silver
snuffbox
all
the
same
said
she
mark
the
predestination
xvi
castel
ventirose
august
dear
marchdale
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
if
you
can
dine
with
us
on
thursday
evening
next
at
eight
to
meet
my
uncle
cardinal
udeschini
who
is
staying
here
for
a
few
days
i
have
been
man
of
words
i
want
you
to
tell
me
a
great
deal
more
about
your
friend
the
author
yours
sincerely
beatrice
di
it
is
astonishing
what
men
will
prize
what
men
will
treasure
peter
marchdale
for
example
prizes
treasures
and
imagines
that
he
will
always
prize
and
treasure
the
perfectly
conventional
the
perfectly
commonplace
little
document
of
which
the
foregoing
is
a
copy
the
original
is
written
in
rather
a
small
concentrated
hand
not
overwhelmingly
legible
perhaps
but
as
we
say
full
of
character
on
paper
lightly
blueish
in
the
prescribed
corner
of
which
a
tiny
ducal
coronet
is
embossed
above
the
initials
b
curiously
interlaced
in
a
cypher
when
peter
received
it
and
need
i
mention
approached
it
to
his
face
he
fancied
he
could
detect
just
a
trace
just
the
faintest
reminder
of
a
perfume
something
like
an
afterthought
of
orris
it
was
by
no
means
anodyne
it
was
a
breath
a
whisper
vague
elusive
hinting
of
things
exquisite
intimate
of
things
intimately
feminine
exquisitely
personal
i
do
know
how
many
times
he
repeated
that
manoeuvre
of
conveying
the
letter
to
his
face
but
i
do
know
that
when
i
was
privileged
to
inspect
it
a
few
months
later
the
only
perfume
it
retained
was
an
unmistakable
perfume
of
tobacco
i
do
know
either
how
many
times
he
read
it
searched
it
as
if
secrets
might
lie
perdu
between
the
lines
as
if
his
gaze
could
warm
into
evidence
some
sympathetic
ink
or
compel
a
cryptic
from
the
text
itself
well
to
be
sure
the
text
had
cryptic
subintentions
but
these
were
as
far
as
may
be
from
any
that
peter
was
in
a
position
to
conjecture
how
could
he
guess
for
instance
that
the
letter
was
an
instrument
and
he
the
victim
of
a
popish
machination
how
could
he
guess
that
its
writer
knew
as
well
as
he
did
who
was
the
author
of
a
man
of
words
and
then
all
at
once
a
shade
of
trouble
of
quite
another
nature
fell
upon
his
mind
he
frowned
for
a
while
in
silent
perplexity
at
last
he
addressed
himself
to
marietta
have
you
ever
dined
with
a
cardinal
he
asked
no
signorino
that
patient
sufferer
replied
well
i
in
the
very
dickens
of
a
quandary
son
proprio
nel
dickens
he
informed
her
dickens
she
repeated
si
dickens
carlo
celebre
autore
inglese
why
not
he
asked
marietta
gazed
with
eyes
at
the
horizon
or
to
put
it
differently
peter
resumed
i
come
all
the
way
from
london
with
nothing
better
than
a
dinner
jacket
in
my
dina
giacca
cosa
e
questioned
marietta
no
matter
what
it
is
the
important
thing
is
what
it
is
it
is
a
non
e
un
abito
nero
said
marietta
seeing
that
he
expected
her
to
say
something
well
you
perceive
my
difficulty
do
you
think
you
could
make
me
one
said
peter
make
the
signorino
a
i
oh
no
marietta
shook
her
head
i
feared
as
much
he
acknowledged
is
there
a
decent
tailor
in
the
village
no
nor
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
this
peninsula
if
you
come
to
that
well
what
am
i
to
do
how
am
i
to
dine
with
a
cardinal
do
you
think
a
cardinal
would
have
a
fit
if
a
man
were
to
dine
with
him
in
a
dina
giacca
have
a
fit
why
should
he
have
a
fit
signorino
marietta
blinked
would
he
do
anything
to
the
man
would
he
launch
the
awful
curses
of
the
church
at
him
for
instance
mache
signorino
she
struck
an
attitude
that
put
to
scorn
his
apprehensions
i
see
said
peter
you
think
there
is
no
danger
you
advise
me
to
brazen
the
dina
giacca
out
to
swagger
it
off
i
do
understand
signorino
said
marietta
to
understand
is
to
forgive
said
he
and
yet
you
ca
trifle
with
english
servants
like
this
though
they
ought
to
understand
ought
they
in
any
case
i
be
guided
by
your
judgment
i
wear
my
dina
giacca
but
i
wear
it
with
an
air
i
confer
upon
it
the
dignity
of
a
is
that
a
gardener
that
person
working
over
there
marietta
looked
in
the
quarter
indicated
by
peter
nod
yes
signorino
ha
is
the
same
gardener
who
works
here
three
days
every
week
she
answered
is
he
really
he
looks
like
a
pirate
peter
murmured
like
a
pirate
luigi
she
exclaimed
yes
affirmed
her
master
he
wears
green
corduroy
trousers
and
a
red
belt
and
a
blue
shirt
that
is
the
pirate
uniform
he
has
a
swarthy
skin
and
a
piercing
eye
and
hair
as
black
as
the
jolly
roger
those
are
the
marks
by
which
you
recognise
a
pirate
even
when
in
mufti
i
believe
you
said
his
name
is
luigi
yes
signorino
luigi
maroni
we
call
him
is
gigi
versatile
asked
peter
versatile
puzzled
marietta
but
then
risking
her
own
interpretation
of
the
recondite
word
oh
no
signorino
he
is
of
the
ah
he
of
the
country
is
he
so
much
the
better
then
he
will
know
the
way
to
castel
ventirose
but
naturally
marietta
nodded
and
do
you
think
for
once
in
a
way
though
not
versatile
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
divert
his
faculties
from
the
work
of
a
gardener
to
that
of
a
messenger
a
messenger
signorino
marietta
wrinkled
up
her
brow
ang
an
unofficial
postman
do
you
think
he
could
be
induced
to
carry
a
letter
for
me
to
the
castle
but
certainly
signorino
he
is
here
to
obey
the
signorino
marietta
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
waved
her
hands
then
tell
him
please
to
go
and
put
the
necessary
touches
to
his
toilet
said
peter
meanwhile
i
indite
the
when
his
letter
was
indited
he
found
the
gigi
in
attendance
and
he
gave
it
to
him
with
instructions
thereupon
gigi
with
a
smile
of
sympathetic
intelligence
inimitably
italian
put
the
letter
in
his
hat
put
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
started
briskly
off
but
not
in
the
proper
direction
not
in
the
direction
of
the
road
which
led
to
the
village
and
across
the
bridge
and
then
round
upon
itself
to
the
gates
of
the
park
he
started
briskly
off
towards
peter
own
toolhouse
a
low
pavilion
opposite
the
door
of
marietta
kitchen
peter
was
on
the
point
of
calling
to
him
of
remonstrating
then
he
thought
better
of
it
he
would
wait
a
bit
and
watch
he
waited
and
watched
and
this
was
what
he
saw
gigi
entered
the
and
presently
brought
out
a
ladder
which
he
carried
down
to
the
riverside
and
left
there
then
he
returned
to
the
and
came
back
bearing
an
armful
of
planks
each
perhaps
a
foot
wide
by
five
or
six
feet
long
now
he
raised
his
ladder
to
the
perpendicular
and
let
it
descend
before
him
so
that
one
extremity
resting
upon
the
nearer
bank
one
attained
the
further
and
it
spanned
the
flood
finally
he
laid
a
plank
lengthwise
upon
the
hithermost
rungs
and
advanced
to
the
end
of
it
then
another
plank
then
a
third
and
he
stood
in
the
grounds
of
ventirose
he
had
improvised
a
bridge
a
bridge
that
swayed
upwards
and
downwards
more
or
less
dizzily
about
the
middle
if
you
will
but
an
entirely
practicable
bridge
for
all
that
and
he
had
saved
himself
at
least
a
good
three
miles
to
the
castle
and
back
by
the
road
peter
watched
and
admired
and
i
asked
whether
he
was
versatile
he
muttered
trust
an
italian
for
economising
labour
it
looks
like
unwarrantable
invasion
of
friendly
territory
but
it
a
dodge
worth
remembering
all
the
he
drew
the
duchessa
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
again
and
again
approached
it
to
his
face
communing
with
that
ghost
of
a
perfume
heavens
how
it
makes
one
think
of
chiffons
he
exclaimed
thursday
thursday
help
me
to
live
till
thursday
xvii
but
he
had
to
live
till
thursday
he
was
destined
to
see
her
not
later
than
the
next
afternoon
you
know
with
what
abruptness
with
how
brief
a
warning
storms
will
spring
from
the
blue
in
that
land
of
lakes
and
mountains
it
was
three
or
thereabouts
and
peter
was
reading
in
his
garden
and
the
whole
world
lay
basking
in
unmitigated
sunshine
then
all
at
once
somehow
you
felt
a
change
in
things
the
sunshine
seemed
less
brilliant
the
shadows
less
solid
less
sharply
outlined
oh
it
was
very
slight
very
uncertain
you
had
to
look
twice
to
assure
yourself
that
it
was
a
mere
fancy
it
seemed
as
if
never
so
thin
a
gauze
had
been
drawn
over
the
face
of
the
sun
just
faintly
bedimming
without
obscuring
it
you
could
have
ransacked
the
sky
in
vain
to
discover
the
smallest
shred
of
cloud
at
the
same
time
the
air
which
had
been
hot
all
day
hot
but
buoyant
but
stimulant
but
quick
with
oxygen
seemed
to
become
thick
sluggish
suffocating
seemed
to
yield
up
its
vital
principle
and
to
fall
a
dead
weight
upon
the
earth
and
this
effect
was
accompanied
by
a
sudden
silence
the
usual
busy
country
noises
were
suddenly
suspended
the
locusts
stopped
their
singing
not
a
bird
twittered
not
a
leaf
rustled
the
world
held
its
breath
and
if
the
river
went
on
babbling
babbling
that
was
a
very
part
of
the
silence
accented
underscored
it
yet
still
you
could
not
discern
a
rack
of
cloud
anywhere
in
the
sky
still
for
a
minute
or
two
then
before
you
knew
how
it
had
happened
the
of
monte
sfiorito
were
completely
lapped
in
cloud
and
now
the
cloud
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
spread
and
sank
cancelling
the
sun
shrouding
the
gnisi
to
its
waist
curling
in
smoky
wreaths
among
the
battlements
of
the
cornobastone
turning
the
lake
from
sapphire
to
sombre
steel
filling
the
entire
valley
with
a
strange
mixture
of
darkness
and
an
uncanny
pallid
light
overhead
it
hung
like
a
vast
canopy
of
at
the
west
it
had
a
fringe
of
fiery
crimson
beyond
which
a
strip
of
clear
sky
on
the
horizon
diffused
a
dull
metallic
yellow
like
tarnished
brass
presently
in
the
distance
there
was
a
low
growl
of
thunder
in
a
minute
a
louder
angrier
growl
as
if
the
first
were
a
menace
which
had
not
been
heeded
then
there
was
a
violent
gush
of
wind
cold
smelling
of
the
forests
from
which
it
came
scattering
everything
before
it
dust
dead
leaves
the
fallen
petals
of
flowers
making
the
trees
writhe
and
labour
like
giants
wrestling
with
invisible
giants
making
the
short
grass
shudder
corrugating
the
steel
surface
of
the
lake
then
two
or
three
big
raindrops
fell
and
then
the
deluge
peter
climbed
up
to
his
observatory
a
square
turret
at
the
top
of
the
house
thence
to
watch
the
storm
and
exult
in
it
really
it
was
splendid
to
see
to
hear
its
immense
wild
force
its
immense
reckless
fury
rain
had
never
rained
so
hard
he
thought
already
the
lake
the
mountain
slopes
the
villas
and
vineyards
westward
were
totally
blotted
out
hidden
behind
walls
and
walls
of
water
and
even
the
neighbouring
lawns
of
ventirose
the
confines
of
his
own
garden
were
barely
distinguishable
blurred
as
by
a
fog
the
big
drops
pelted
the
river
like
bullets
sending
up
splashes
bigger
than
themselves
and
the
tiled
roof
just
above
his
head
resounded
with
a
continual
loud
crepitation
as
if
a
multitude
of
elves
were
dancing
on
it
the
thunder
crashed
roared
reverberated
like
the
toppling
of
great
edifices
the
lightning
tore
through
the
black
in
long
blinding
the
wind
moaned
howled
hooted
and
the
square
chamber
where
peter
stood
shook
and
rattled
under
its
buffetings
and
was
full
of
the
chill
and
the
smell
of
it
really
the
whole
thing
was
splendid
his
ran
with
muddy
brooklets
the
beyond
his
hedge
was
transformed
to
a
shallow
torrent
and
just
at
that
moment
looking
off
along
the
highroad
he
saw
something
that
brought
his
heart
into
his
throat
three
figures
were
hurrying
down
it
in
the
rain
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
emilia
manfredi
and
a
priest
in
a
twinkling
peter
bareheaded
was
at
his
gate
come
in
come
in
he
called
we
are
simply
drenched
we
shall
inundate
your
house
the
duchessa
said
as
he
showed
them
into
his
they
were
indeed
dripping
with
water
soiled
to
their
knees
with
mud
good
heavens
gasped
peter
stupid
how
were
you
ever
out
in
such
a
downpour
she
smiled
rather
forlornly
no
one
told
us
that
it
was
going
to
rain
and
we
were
off
for
a
good
long
walk
for
you
must
be
wet
to
the
bone
you
must
be
perishing
with
cold
he
cried
looking
from
one
to
another
yes
i
daresay
we
are
perishing
with
cold
she
admitted
and
i
have
no
means
of
offering
you
a
fire
there
are
no
fireplaces
he
groaned
with
a
gesture
round
the
bleak
italian
room
to
certify
their
absence
is
there
a
kitchen
asked
the
duchessa
a
faint
spark
of
raillery
kindling
amid
the
forlornness
of
her
smile
peter
threw
up
his
hands
i
had
lost
my
head
the
kitchen
of
course
i
tell
marietta
to
light
a
he
excused
himself
and
sought
out
marietta
he
found
her
in
her
housekeeper
room
on
her
knees
saying
her
rosary
in
obvious
terror
i
afraid
he
interrupted
her
orisons
somewhat
brusquely
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
start
a
rousing
fire
in
the
kitchen
as
quickly
as
ever
it
can
be
done
and
he
rejoined
his
guests
if
you
will
come
this
way
he
said
marietta
had
a
fire
of
logs
and
blazing
in
no
time
she
courtesied
low
to
the
duchessa
lower
still
to
the
priest
in
fact
peter
was
sure
that
she
did
genuflect
before
him
while
he
made
a
rapid
movement
with
his
hand
over
her
head
the
sign
of
the
cross
perhaps
he
was
a
little
white
haired
priest
with
a
remarkably
clever
humorous
kindly
face
and
he
wore
a
remarkably
shabby
cassock
the
duchessa
chaplain
peter
supposed
how
should
it
occur
to
him
that
this
was
cardinal
udeschini
do
cardinals
in
antecedent
notion
of
them
wear
shabby
cassocks
and
look
humorous
and
unassuming
do
they
go
tramping
about
the
country
in
the
rain
attended
by
no
retinue
save
a
woman
and
a
girl
and
are
they
little
men
in
one
antecedent
notion
true
his
shabby
cassock
had
red
buttons
and
there
was
a
red
sash
round
his
waist
and
a
big
amethyst
glittered
in
a
setting
of
pale
gold
on
his
annular
finger
but
peter
was
not
sufficiently
versed
in
fashions
canonical
to
recognise
the
meaning
of
these
insignia
how
on
the
other
hand
should
it
occur
to
the
duchessa
that
peter
needed
enlightenment
at
all
events
she
said
to
him
let
me
introduce
you
and
then
to
the
priest
let
me
present
marchdale
of
whom
you
have
heard
before
the
old
man
smiled
sweetly
into
peter
eyes
and
gave
him
a
slender
sensitive
old
hand
e
cattivo
vento
che
non
e
buono
per
qualcuno
debbo
a
questa
burrasca
la
pregustazione
d
un
piacere
he
said
with
a
mingling
of
ceremonious
politeness
and
sunny
geniality
that
was
of
his
age
and
race
peter
instinctively
he
could
not
have
told
why
put
a
good
deal
more
deference
into
his
bow
than
men
of
his
age
and
race
commonly
put
into
their
bows
and
murmured
something
about
grand
marietta
placed
a
row
of
chairs
before
the
raised
stone
hearth
and
afterwards
at
her
master
request
busied
herself
preparing
tea
but
i
think
you
would
all
be
wise
to
take
a
little
brandy
first
peter
suggested
it
is
my
despair
that
i
am
not
able
to
provide
you
with
a
change
of
raiment
brandy
will
be
the
best
substitute
the
old
priest
laughed
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
emilia
you
have
spared
this
young
lady
an
embarrassing
avowal
brandy
is
exactly
what
she
was
screwing
her
courage
to
the
point
of
asking
oh
no
protested
emilia
in
a
deep
italian
voice
with
passionate
seriousness
but
peter
fetched
a
decanter
and
poured
brandy
for
everyone
i
drink
to
your
health
bien
le
cas
de
le
dire
i
hope
you
will
not
have
caught
your
deaths
of
cold
he
said
oh
we
are
quite
warm
now
said
the
duchessa
we
are
snug
in
an
ingle
on
mount
our
wetting
will
have
done
us
good
it
will
make
us
grow
you
and
i
will
never
regret
that
will
we
emilietta
said
the
priest
a
lively
colour
had
come
into
the
duchessa
cheeks
her
eyes
seemed
unusually
bright
her
hair
was
in
some
disorder
drooping
at
the
sides
and
blown
over
her
brow
in
fine
free
wavelets
it
was
dark
in
the
kitchen
save
for
the
firelight
which
danced
fantastically
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
struck
a
ruddy
glow
from
marietta
copper
pots
and
pans
the
rain
pattered
lustily
without
the
wind
wailed
in
the
chimney
the
lightning
flashed
the
thunder
volleyed
and
peter
looked
at
the
duchessa
and
blessed
the
elements
to
see
her
seated
there
in
her
wet
gown
seated
familiarly
at
her
ease
before
his
fire
in
his
kitchen
with
that
colour
in
her
cheeks
that
brightness
in
her
eyes
and
her
hair
in
that
disarray
it
was
unspeakable
his
heart
closed
in
a
kind
of
delicious
spasm
and
the
fragrance
subtle
secret
evasive
that
hovered
in
the
air
near
her
did
not
diminish
his
emotion
i
wonder
she
asked
with
a
comical
little
glance
upwards
at
him
whether
you
would
resent
it
very
much
if
i
should
take
off
my
hat
because
it
a
perfect
reservoir
and
the
water
will
keep
trickling
down
my
his
joy
needed
but
this
culmination
that
she
should
take
off
her
hat
oh
i
beg
of
you
he
returned
fervently
you
had
better
take
yours
off
too
emilia
said
the
duchessa
admire
masculine
foresight
said
the
priest
i
took
mine
off
when
i
came
let
me
hang
them
up
said
peter
it
was
wonderful
to
hold
her
hat
in
his
hand
it
was
like
holding
a
part
of
herself
he
brushed
it
surreptitiously
against
his
face
as
he
hung
it
up
its
fragrance
which
met
him
like
an
answering
caress
almost
did
not
lessen
his
emotion
then
marietta
brought
the
tea
with
and
toast
and
cakes
and
pretty
blue
china
cups
and
saucers
and
silver
that
glittered
in
the
firelight
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
pouring
the
tea
peter
asked
the
duchessa
so
she
poured
the
tea
and
peter
passed
it
as
he
stood
close
to
her
to
take
it
oh
but
his
heart
beat
believe
me
and
once
when
she
was
giving
him
a
cup
the
warm
tips
of
her
fingers
lightly
touched
his
hand
believe
me
the
touch
had
its
effect
and
always
there
was
that
heady
fragrance
in
the
air
like
a
mysterious
little
voice
singing
secrets
i
wonder
the
old
priest
said
why
tea
is
not
more
generally
drunk
by
us
italians
i
never
taste
it
without
resolving
to
acquire
the
habit
i
remember
when
i
was
a
child
our
mothers
used
to
keep
it
as
a
medicine
and
you
could
only
buy
it
at
the
chemists
it
coming
in
you
know
at
rome
among
the
whites
said
the
duchessa
among
the
whites
cried
he
with
a
jocular
simulation
of
disquiet
you
should
not
have
told
me
that
till
i
had
finished
my
cup
now
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
sharing
a
dissipation
with
our
that
should
give
an
edge
to
its
aroma
laughed
she
and
besides
the
whites
are
all
responsible
for
our
spoliation
some
of
them
are
not
so
white
as
your
fancy
paints
them
they
be
very
decent
people
for
the
most
part
if
they
were
so
if
you
stick
up
for
the
whites
like
that
when
i
am
pope
i
shall
excommunicate
you
the
priest
threatened
meanwhile
what
have
you
to
say
against
the
blacks
the
blacks
with
few
exceptions
are
even
blacker
than
they
painted
but
they
too
would
be
fairly
decent
people
in
their
way
if
they
were
so
respectable
that
is
what
makes
rome
impossible
as
a
residence
for
any
one
who
cares
for
human
society
white
society
is
so
vulgar
black
society
is
so
deadly
it
is
rather
curious
said
the
priest
that
the
chief
of
each
party
should
wear
the
colour
of
his
adversary
our
chief
dresses
in
white
and
their
chief
can
be
seen
any
day
driving
about
the
streets
in
and
peter
during
this
interchange
of
was
at
liberty
to
feast
his
eyes
upon
her
perhaps
you
have
not
yet
reached
the
time
of
life
where
men
begin
to
find
a
virtue
in
snuff
the
priest
said
producing
a
smart
silver
snuff
box
tapping
the
lid
and
proffering
it
to
peter
on
the
contrary
thank
you
peter
answered
and
absorbed
his
pinch
like
an
adept
how
on
earth
have
you
learned
to
take
it
without
a
paroxysm
cried
the
surprised
duchessa
oh
a
thousand
years
ago
i
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
he
explained
it
is
one
of
the
emilia
manfredi
lifted
her
big
brown
eyes
filled
with
girlish
wonder
to
his
face
and
exclaimed
how
extraordinary
it
is
half
so
extraordinary
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
true
my
dear
said
the
duchessa
oh
non
e
poi
vero
murmured
emilia
and
her
eyes
darkened
with
disappointment
peter
meanwhile
was
looking
at
the
snuffbox
which
the
priest
still
held
in
his
hand
and
admiring
its
brave
repousse
work
of
leaves
and
flowers
and
the
escutcheon
engraved
on
the
lid
but
what
if
he
could
have
guessed
the
part
he
had
passively
played
in
obtaining
it
for
its
possessor
or
the
part
that
it
was
still
to
play
in
his
own
epopee
mark
again
the
predestination
the
storm
is
passing
said
the
priest
worse
luck
thought
peter
for
indeed
the
rain
and
the
wind
were
moderating
the
thunder
had
rolled
farther
away
the
sky
was
becoming
lighter
but
there
a
mighty
problem
before
us
still
said
the
duchessa
how
are
we
to
get
to
ventirose
the
roads
will
be
with
if
you
wish
to
do
me
a
very
great
kindness
peter
began
yes
she
encouraged
him
you
will
allow
me
to
go
before
you
and
tell
them
to
come
for
you
with
a
i
shall
certainly
allow
you
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
replied
severely
i
suppose
there
is
no
one
whom
you
could
send
i
should
hardly
like
to
send
marietta
i
afraid
there
is
no
one
else
but
upon
my
word
i
should
enjoy
going
she
shook
her
head
smiling
at
him
with
mock
compassion
would
you
poor
man
poor
man
that
is
an
enjoyment
which
you
will
have
to
renounce
one
must
expect
too
much
in
this
sad
well
then
said
peter
i
have
an
expedient
if
you
can
walk
a
somewhat
narrow
plank
yes
questioned
she
i
think
i
can
improvise
a
bridge
across
the
i
believe
the
rain
has
stopped
said
the
priest
looking
towards
the
window
peter
manning
his
soul
for
the
inevitable
got
up
went
to
the
door
opened
it
stuck
out
his
head
yes
he
acknowledged
while
his
heart
sank
within
him
the
rain
has
and
now
the
storm
departed
almost
as
rapidly
as
it
had
arrived
in
the
north
the
sky
was
already
clear
blue
and
a
wall
of
the
dark
was
drifting
to
the
south
suddenly
the
sun
came
out
flashing
first
from
the
snows
of
monte
sfiorito
then
in
an
instant
flooding
the
entire
prospect
with
a
marvellous
yellow
light
ethereal
amber
whilst
long
streamers
of
tinted
vapour
columns
of
one
might
have
fancied
rose
to
meet
it
and
all
wet
surfaces
leaves
lawns
housetops
the
bare
crags
of
the
gnisi
gleamed
in
a
wash
of
gold
puffs
of
fresh
air
blew
into
the
kitchen
filling
it
with
the
keen
sweet
odour
of
wet
earth
the
priest
and
the
duchessa
and
emilia
joined
peter
at
the
open
door
oh
your
poor
poor
garden
the
duchessa
cried
his
garden
had
suffered
a
good
deal
to
be
sure
the
flowers
lay
supine
their
faces
beaten
into
the
mud
the
greensward
was
littered
with
fallen
leaves
and
twigs
and
even
in
one
or
two
places
whole
branches
had
been
broken
from
the
trees
on
the
ground
about
each
a
snow
of
pink
lay
scattered
in
the
paths
there
were
hundreds
of
little
pools
shining
in
the
sun
like
pools
of
fire
there
nothing
a
gardener
ca
set
right
said
peter
feeling
no
doubt
that
here
was
a
trifling
tax
upon
the
delights
the
storm
had
procured
him
and
oh
our
poor
poor
hats
said
the
duchessa
eyeing
ruefully
those
damaged
pieces
of
finery
i
fear
no
gardener
can
ever
set
them
it
sounds
inhospitable
said
peter
but
i
suppose
i
had
better
go
and
build
your
so
he
threw
a
ladder
athwart
the
river
and
laid
the
planks
in
place
as
he
had
seen
gigi
do
the
day
before
how
ingenious
and
like
all
great
things
how
simple
laughed
the
duchessa
peter
waved
his
hand
as
who
should
modestly
deprecate
applause
but
i
ashamed
to
own
he
did
disclaim
the
credit
of
the
invention
it
will
require
some
nerve
she
reflected
looking
at
the
narrow
planks
the
foaming
green
water
however
and
gathering
in
her
skirts
she
set
bravely
forward
and
made
the
transit
without
mishap
the
priest
and
emilia
gathering
in
their
skirts
made
it
after
her
she
paused
on
the
other
side
and
looked
back
smiling
since
you
have
discovered
so
efficacious
a
means
of
cutting
short
the
distance
between
our
places
of
abode
she
said
i
hope
you
will
not
fail
to
profit
by
it
whenever
you
may
have
occasion
on
thursday
for
thank
you
very
much
said
peter
of
course
she
went
on
we
may
all
die
of
our
wetting
yet
it
would
perhaps
show
a
neighbourly
interest
if
you
were
to
come
up
and
take
our
news
come
at
four
and
if
we
alive
you
shall
have
another
pinch
of
snuff
she
promised
laughing
i
adore
you
said
peter
under
his
breath
i
come
with
great
pleasure
he
said
aloud
marietta
he
observed
that
evening
as
he
dined
i
would
have
you
to
know
that
the
aco
is
bridged
hence
there
is
one
symbol
the
fewer
in
lombardy
but
why
does
you
must
mind
the
ollendorfian
form
of
my
enquiry
why
does
the
chaplain
of
the
duchessa
wear
red
stockings
the
chaplain
of
the
duchessa
repeated
marietta
wrinkling
up
her
brow
ang
of
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
he
wore
red
stockings
and
shoes
with
silver
buckles
do
you
think
that
precisely
decorous
do
you
think
it
the
least
bit
in
an
ecclesiastic
he
who
questioned
marietta
but
the
chaplain
of
the
duchessa
when
he
was
here
this
the
chaplain
of
the
duchessa
exclaimed
marietta
here
this
afternoon
the
chaplain
of
the
duchessa
was
not
here
this
afternoon
his
eminence
the
lord
prince
cardinal
udeschini
was
here
this
what
gasped
peter
ang
said
marietta
that
was
cardinal
udeschini
that
little
old
man
peter
wondered
sicuro
the
uncle
of
the
duca
said
she
good
heavens
sighed
he
and
i
allowed
myself
to
hobnob
with
him
like
a
gia
said
she
you
need
rub
it
in
said
he
for
the
matter
of
that
you
yourself
entertained
him
in
your
scusi
said
she
ah
well
it
was
probably
for
the
best
he
concluded
i
daresay
i
should
have
behaved
much
better
if
i
had
it
was
his
coming
which
saved
this
house
from
being
struck
by
lightning
announced
marietta
oh
was
it
exclaimed
peter
yes
signorino
the
lightning
would
never
strike
a
house
that
the
lord
prince
cardinal
was
i
see
it
would
venture
it
would
presume
did
did
it
strike
all
the
houses
that
the
lord
prince
cardinal
was
in
i
do
not
think
so
signorino
ma
non
fa
niente
it
was
a
terrible
storm
terrible
terrible
the
lightning
was
going
to
strike
this
house
when
the
lord
prince
cardinal
hum
said
peter
then
you
as
well
as
i
have
reason
for
regarding
his
arrival
as
xviii
i
think
something
must
have
happened
to
my
watch
peter
said
next
day
indeed
its
hands
moved
with
extraordinary
with
exasperating
slowness
it
seems
absurd
that
it
should
do
no
good
to
push
them
on
he
thought
he
would
force
himself
between
twice
ascertaining
their
position
to
wait
for
a
period
that
felt
like
an
eternity
walking
about
miserably
and
smoking
flavourless
cigarettes
then
he
would
stand
amazed
incredulous
when
with
a
smirk
as
it
almost
struck
him
of
ironical
complacence
they
would
attest
that
his
eternity
had
lasted
something
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
had
professed
myself
a
kantian
and
made
light
of
the
objective
reality
of
time
thou
laggard
time
he
cried
and
shook
his
fist
at
space
time
unoffending
consort
i
believe
it
will
never
be
four
again
he
said
in
despair
finally
and
once
more
had
out
his
watch
it
was
three
he
scowled
at
the
instrument
bland
white
face
you
have
no
bowels
no
sensibilities
nothing
but
dry
little
methodical
wheels
and
pivots
he
exclaimed
flying
to
insult
for
relief
you
as
inhuman
as
a
french
functionary
do
you
call
yourself
a
sympathetic
comrade
for
an
impatient
man
he
laid
it
open
on
his
rustic
table
and
waited
through
a
last
eternity
at
a
quarter
to
four
he
crossed
the
river
if
i
am
early
tant
pis
he
decided
choosing
the
lesser
of
two
evils
and
challenging
fate
he
crossed
the
river
and
stood
for
the
first
time
in
the
grounds
of
ventirose
stood
where
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
during
their
colloquies
he
glanced
back
at
his
house
and
garden
envisaging
them
for
the
first
time
as
it
were
from
her
point
of
view
they
had
a
queer
air
of
belonging
to
an
era
that
had
passed
to
a
yesterday
already
remote
they
looked
somehow
curiously
small
moreover
the
garden
circumscribed
the
house
with
its
striped
sunblinds
poor
and
petty
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
left
them
behind
he
would
have
to
come
home
to
them
later
in
the
day
to
be
sure
but
then
everything
would
be
different
a
chapter
would
have
added
itself
to
the
history
of
the
world
a
great
event
a
great
step
forward
would
have
definitely
taken
place
he
would
have
been
received
at
ventirose
as
a
friend
he
would
be
no
longer
a
mere
nodding
acquaintance
owing
even
that
meagre
relationship
to
the
haphazard
of
propinquity
the
if
you
will
but
still
present
in
abundance
would
have
been
gently
thawed
away
one
era
had
passed
but
then
a
new
era
would
have
begun
so
he
turned
his
back
upon
villa
and
set
off
up
the
wide
lawns
under
the
bending
trees
whither
on
four
occasions
he
had
watched
her
disappear
towards
the
castle
which
faced
him
in
its
vast
irregular
picturesqueness
there
were
the
oldest
portions
grimly
mediaeval
a
lakeside
fortress
with
ponderous
round
towers
meurtrieres
machiolations
its
grey
stone
walls
discoloured
in
fantastic
streaks
and
patches
by
and
lichens
or
else
shaggily
overgrown
by
creepers
then
there
were
later
portions
rectangular
with
rusticated
work
at
the
corners
and
on
the
blank
spaces
between
the
windows
quaint
allegorical
frescoes
faded
half
and
then
there
were
entirely
portions
of
gleaming
marble
with
numberless
fanciful
carvings
spires
pinnacles
reliefs
wonderfully
light
gay
habitable
and
peter
thought
beautiful
in
the
clear
italian
atmosphere
against
the
blue
italian
sky
it
a
perfect
house
for
her
he
said
it
suits
her
like
an
appropriate
garment
it
almost
seems
to
express
and
all
the
while
as
he
proceeded
her
voice
kept
sounding
in
his
ears
scraps
of
her
conversation
phrases
that
she
had
spoken
kept
coming
back
to
him
one
end
of
the
long
wide
marble
terrace
had
been
arranged
as
a
sort
of
a
white
awning
was
stretched
overhead
rugs
were
laid
on
the
pavement
there
were
wicker
with
bright
cushions
and
a
little
table
holding
books
and
things
the
duchessa
rose
from
one
of
the
and
came
forward
smiling
to
meet
him
she
gave
him
her
hand
for
the
first
time
it
was
warm
electrically
warm
and
it
was
soft
womanly
soft
and
it
was
firm
alive
it
spoke
of
a
vitality
a
temperament
peter
was
sure
besides
that
it
would
be
sweet
to
smell
and
he
longed
to
bend
over
it
and
press
it
with
his
lips
he
might
almost
have
done
so
according
to
italian
etiquette
but
of
course
he
simply
bowed
over
it
and
let
it
go
mi
trova
abbandonata
she
said
leading
the
way
back
to
the
there
were
notes
of
a
peculiar
richness
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
italian
and
she
dwelt
languorously
on
the
vowels
and
rather
slurred
the
consonants
lazily
in
the
manner
italian
women
have
whereby
they
give
the
quality
of
velvet
to
their
tongue
she
was
not
an
italian
woman
heaven
be
praised
she
was
english
so
this
was
just
pure
gain
to
the
of
her
graces
my
uncle
and
my
niece
have
gone
to
the
village
but
i
expecting
them
to
come
home
at
any
moment
now
and
you
not
have
long
i
hope
to
wait
for
your
she
flashed
a
whimsical
little
smile
into
his
eyes
then
she
returned
to
her
wicker
chair
glancing
an
invitation
at
peter
to
place
himself
in
the
one
facing
her
she
leaned
back
resting
her
head
on
a
pink
silk
cushion
peter
no
doubt
sent
up
a
silent
prayer
that
her
uncle
and
her
niece
might
be
detained
at
the
village
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
by
her
niece
he
took
her
to
mean
emilia
he
liked
her
for
the
kindly
euphemism
what
hair
she
has
he
thought
admiring
the
loose
brown
masses
warm
upon
their
background
of
pink
silk
oh
i
inured
to
waiting
he
replied
with
a
retrospective
mind
for
the
interminable
waits
of
that
interminable
day
the
duchessa
had
taken
a
fan
from
the
table
and
was
playing
with
it
opening
and
shutting
it
slowly
in
her
lap
now
she
caught
peter
eyes
examining
it
and
she
gave
it
to
him
my
own
suspicion
is
that
eyes
had
been
occupied
rather
with
the
hands
that
held
the
fan
than
with
the
fan
itself
but
that
a
detail
i
picked
it
up
the
other
day
in
rome
she
said
of
course
an
imitation
of
the
french
fans
of
the
last
century
but
i
thought
it
it
was
of
white
silk
that
had
been
thinly
stained
a
soft
yellow
like
the
yellow
of
faded
yellow
it
was
painted
with
innumerable
plump
little
cupids
flying
among
pale
clouds
the
sticks
were
of
the
were
elaborately
incised
and
in
the
incisions
opals
were
set
big
ones
and
small
ones
smouldering
with
green
and
scarlet
fires
very
pretty
indeed
said
peter
and
very
curious
it
like
a
great
butterfly
wing
is
it
but
are
you
afraid
of
opals
afraid
of
opals
she
wondered
why
should
one
be
unless
your
birthday
happens
to
fall
in
october
they
reputed
to
bring
bad
luck
he
reminded
her
my
birthday
happens
to
fall
in
june
but
i
never
believe
that
such
pretty
things
as
opals
can
bring
bad
luck
she
laughed
taking
the
fan
which
he
returned
to
her
and
stroking
one
of
the
bigger
opals
with
her
finger
tip
have
you
no
superstitions
he
asked
i
hope
not
i
do
think
i
have
she
answered
we
not
allowed
to
have
superstitions
you
know
nous
autres
oh
he
said
with
surprise
no
i
did
yes
they
a
forbidden
luxury
but
you
are
you
superstitious
would
you
be
afraid
of
opals
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
the
courage
to
wear
one
at
all
events
i
do
regard
superstitions
in
the
light
of
a
luxury
i
should
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
those
i
have
they
a
horrible
inconvenience
but
i
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
the
air
is
filled
with
a
swarm
of
malignant
little
devils
who
are
always
watching
their
chance
to
do
us
an
ill
turn
we
do
in
the
least
know
the
conditions
under
which
they
can
bring
it
off
but
it
legendary
that
if
we
wear
opals
or
sit
thirteen
at
table
or
start
an
enterprise
on
friday
or
what
not
we
somehow
give
them
their
opportunity
and
one
naturally
wishes
to
be
on
the
safe
she
looked
at
him
with
doubt
considering
you
do
seriously
believe
all
that
she
said
no
i
do
seriously
believe
it
but
one
breathes
it
in
with
the
air
of
one
nursery
and
it
sticks
i
do
believe
it
but
i
fear
it
just
enough
to
be
made
uneasy
the
evil
eye
for
instance
how
can
one
spend
any
time
in
italy
where
everybody
goes
loaded
with
charms
against
it
and
help
having
a
sort
of
sneaking
in
the
evil
eye
she
shook
her
head
laughing
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
italy
but
i
have
so
much
as
a
sneaking
in
i
envy
you
your
strength
of
mind
said
he
but
surely
though
superstition
is
a
luxury
forbidden
to
catholics
there
are
plenty
of
good
catholics
who
indulge
in
it
all
the
same
there
are
never
plenty
of
good
catholics
said
sire
you
employ
a
expression
to
profess
the
catholic
faith
to
go
to
mass
on
sunday
and
abstain
from
meat
on
friday
that
is
by
no
means
sufficient
to
constitute
a
good
catholic
to
be
a
good
catholic
one
would
have
to
be
a
saint
nothing
less
and
not
a
mere
formal
saint
either
but
a
very
real
saint
a
saint
in
thought
and
feeling
as
well
as
in
speech
and
action
just
in
so
far
as
one
is
superstitious
one
is
a
bad
catholic
oh
if
the
world
were
populated
by
good
catholics
it
would
be
the
millennium
come
to
it
would
be
that
if
it
were
populated
by
good
christians
it
asked
peter
the
terms
are
interchangeable
she
answered
sweetly
with
a
look
of
defiance
mercy
cried
he
ca
a
protestant
be
a
good
christian
too
yes
she
said
because
a
protestant
can
be
a
catholic
without
knowing
oh
he
puzzled
frowning
it
quite
simple
she
explained
you
ca
be
a
christian
unless
you
a
catholic
but
if
you
believe
as
much
of
christian
truth
as
you
ever
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
learning
and
if
you
try
to
live
in
accordance
with
christian
morals
you
are
a
catholic
you
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
whether
you
know
it
or
not
you
ca
be
deprived
of
your
birthright
you
that
seems
rather
broad
said
peter
and
one
had
always
heard
that
catholicism
was
nothing
if
not
how
could
it
be
catholic
if
it
were
narrow
asked
she
however
if
a
protestant
uses
his
intelligence
and
is
logical
he
not
remain
an
unconscious
catholic
long
if
he
studies
the
matter
and
is
logical
he
wish
to
unite
himself
to
the
church
in
her
visible
body
look
at
england
see
how
logic
is
multiplying
converts
year
by
but
it
the
glory
of
englishmen
to
be
illogical
said
peter
with
a
laugh
our
capacity
for
not
following
premisses
to
their
logical
consequences
is
the
principal
source
of
our
national
greatness
so
the
bulk
of
the
english
are
likely
to
resist
conversion
for
centuries
to
come
are
they
not
and
then
nowadays
one
is
so
apt
to
be
an
indifferentist
in
matters
of
religion
and
catholicism
is
so
exacting
one
remains
a
protestant
from
the
love
of
and
from
the
desire
on
the
part
of
a
good
many
englishmen
at
least
to
sail
in
a
boat
of
their
own
not
to
get
mixed
up
with
a
lot
of
foreign
publicans
and
sinners
no
she
suggested
oh
of
course
we
insular
and
we
pharisaical
admitted
peter
and
as
for
one
indifference
she
smiled
that
is
most
probably
due
to
one
youth
and
inexperience
one
ca
come
to
close
quarters
with
the
realities
of
life
with
sorrow
with
great
joy
with
temptation
with
sin
or
with
heroic
virtue
with
death
with
the
birth
of
a
new
soul
with
any
of
the
awful
wonderful
realities
of
life
and
continue
to
be
an
indifferentist
in
matters
of
religion
do
you
think
when
one
comes
to
close
quarters
with
the
awful
wonderful
realities
of
life
one
has
religious
moments
he
acknowledged
but
generally
rather
fugitive
are
they
one
can
cultivate
them
one
can
encourage
them
she
said
if
you
would
care
to
know
a
good
catholic
she
added
my
niece
my
little
ward
emilia
is
one
she
wants
to
become
a
sister
of
mercy
to
spend
her
life
nursing
the
oh
would
that
be
rather
a
pity
peter
said
she
so
extremely
pretty
i
do
know
when
i
have
seen
prettier
brown
eyes
than
well
in
a
few
years
i
expect
we
shall
see
those
pretty
brown
eyes
looking
out
from
under
a
sister
coif
no
i
do
think
it
will
be
a
pity
nuns
and
sisters
i
think
are
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
and
priests
have
you
ever
met
any
one
who
seemed
happier
than
my
uncle
for
example
i
have
certainly
never
met
any
one
who
seemed
sweeter
kinder
peter
confessed
he
has
a
wonderful
old
he
a
wonderful
old
man
said
she
i
going
to
try
to
keep
him
a
prisoner
here
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
though
he
will
have
it
that
he
just
run
down
for
a
week
he
works
a
great
deal
too
hard
when
in
rome
he
the
only
cardinal
i
ever
heard
of
who
takes
practical
charge
of
his
titular
church
but
here
in
the
country
he
all
the
blessed
day
hand
in
hand
with
emilia
he
as
young
as
she
is
i
believe
they
play
together
like
children
and
make
me
feel
as
staid
and
solemn
and
as
one
of
kenneth
grahame
peter
laughed
then
in
the
moment
of
silence
that
followed
he
happened
to
let
his
eyes
stray
up
the
valley
hello
he
suddenly
exclaimed
someone
has
been
painting
our
mountain
the
duchessa
turned
to
look
and
she
too
uttered
an
exclamation
by
some
accident
of
reflection
or
refraction
the
snows
of
monte
sfiorito
had
become
bright
green
as
if
the
light
that
fell
on
them
had
passed
through
emeralds
they
both
paused
to
gaze
and
marvel
for
a
little
indeed
the
prospect
was
a
pleasing
one
as
well
as
a
surprising
the
sunny
lawns
the
high
trees
the
blue
lake
and
then
that
bright
green
mountain
i
have
never
known
anything
like
those
for
sailing
under
false
colours
peter
said
i
have
seen
them
every
colour
of
the
calendar
except
their
native
you
must
blame
the
poor
things
pleaded
the
duchessa
they
help
it
it
all
along
o
the
distance
and
the
atmosphere
and
the
she
closed
her
fan
with
which
she
had
been
more
or
less
idly
playing
throughout
their
dialogue
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
among
the
books
there
french
books
for
the
most
part
in
yellow
paper
peter
saw
with
something
of
a
flutter
he
could
never
see
it
without
something
of
a
flutter
the
binding
of
a
man
of
the
duchessa
caught
his
glance
yes
she
said
your
friend
novel
i
told
you
i
had
been
yes
said
he
and
do
you
know
i
inclined
to
agree
with
your
own
enthusiastic
estimate
of
it
she
went
on
i
think
it
extremely
but
extremely
clever
and
more
very
charming
very
beautiful
the
fatal
gift
of
beauty
and
her
smile
reminded
him
that
the
application
of
the
tag
was
his
own
yes
said
he
its
beauty
though
she
reflected
is
exactly
of
the
obvious
sort
is
it
it
does
jump
at
you
for
instance
it
is
rather
in
the
texture
of
the
work
than
on
the
surface
one
has
to
look
to
see
one
always
has
to
look
to
see
beauty
that
is
worth
seeing
he
safely
generalised
but
then
he
had
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
his
hobby
bolted
with
him
it
takes
two
to
make
a
beautiful
object
the
eye
of
the
beholder
is
every
bit
as
indispensable
as
the
hand
of
the
artist
the
artist
does
his
work
the
beholder
must
do
his
they
are
collaborators
each
must
be
the
other
equal
and
they
must
also
be
like
each
other
with
the
likeness
of
opposites
of
complements
art
in
short
is
entirely
a
matter
of
reciprocity
the
kind
of
beauty
that
jumps
at
you
is
the
kind
you
end
by
getting
heartily
tired
of
is
the
kind
and
therefore
it
is
really
beauty
at
all
it
is
only
an
approximation
to
beauty
it
may
be
only
a
simulacrum
of
her
eyes
were
smiling
her
face
was
glowing
softly
with
interest
with
friendliness
and
perhaps
with
the
least
suspicion
of
something
else
perhaps
with
the
faintest
glimmer
of
suppressed
amusement
but
interest
was
easily
predominant
yes
she
assented
but
then
she
pursued
her
own
train
of
ideas
and
with
you
i
particularly
like
the
woman
pauline
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
like
her
i
it
sounds
extravagant
but
it
true
i
can
think
of
no
other
woman
in
the
whole
of
fiction
whom
i
like
so
well
who
makes
so
curiously
personal
an
appeal
to
me
her
wit
her
waywardness
her
tenderness
her
generosity
everything
how
did
your
friend
come
by
his
conception
of
her
she
as
real
to
me
as
any
woman
i
have
ever
known
she
more
real
to
me
than
most
of
the
women
i
know
she
absolutely
real
she
lives
she
breathes
yet
i
have
never
known
a
woman
resembling
her
life
would
be
a
merrier
business
if
one
did
know
women
resembling
her
she
seems
to
me
all
that
a
woman
ought
ideally
to
be
does
your
friend
know
women
like
that
the
lucky
man
or
is
pauline
for
all
her
convincingness
a
pure
creature
of
imagination
ah
said
peter
laughing
you
touch
the
secret
springs
of
my
inspiration
that
is
a
story
in
itself
felix
wildmay
is
a
perfectly
commonplace
englishman
how
could
a
woman
like
pauline
be
the
creature
of
his
imagination
no
she
was
a
seen
god
made
her
wildmay
was
a
mere
copyist
he
drew
her
tant
bien
que
mal
from
the
life
from
a
woman
who
actually
alive
on
this
dull
globe
but
that
the
the
duchessa
eyes
were
intent
the
tell
me
the
story
she
pronounced
in
a
breath
with
imperious
eagerness
and
her
eyes
waited
intently
oh
said
peter
it
one
of
those
stories
that
can
scarcely
be
told
there
hardly
any
thing
to
take
hold
of
it
without
incident
without
progression
it
all
subjective
it
a
drama
in
states
of
mind
pauline
was
a
seen
indeed
but
she
was
a
thing
known
she
was
a
thing
divined
wildmay
never
knew
her
never
even
knew
who
she
was
never
knew
her
name
never
even
knew
her
nationality
though
as
the
book
shows
he
guessed
her
to
be
an
englishwoman
married
to
a
frenchman
he
simply
saw
her
from
a
distance
times
perhaps
he
saw
her
in
paris
once
or
twice
at
the
theatre
at
the
opera
and
then
later
again
once
or
twice
in
london
and
then
once
more
in
paris
in
the
bois
that
was
all
but
that
was
enough
her
appearance
her
face
her
eyes
her
smile
her
way
of
carrying
herself
her
way
of
carrying
her
head
her
gestures
her
movements
her
way
of
dressing
he
never
so
much
as
heard
her
voice
her
mere
appearance
made
an
impression
on
him
such
as
all
the
rest
of
womankind
had
totally
failed
to
make
she
was
exceedingly
lovely
of
course
exceedingly
distinguished
but
she
was
infinitely
more
her
face
her
whole
person
had
an
expression
a
spirit
burned
in
her
a
prismatic
aromatic
fire
other
women
seemed
dust
seemed
dead
beside
her
she
was
a
garden
inexhaustible
of
promises
of
suggestions
wit
capriciousness
generosity
emotion
you
have
said
it
they
were
all
there
race
was
there
nerve
sex
was
there
all
the
mystery
magic
all
the
essential
elemental
principles
of
the
feminine
were
there
she
was
a
woman
a
wonderful
strenuous
soul
was
there
wildmay
saw
it
felt
it
he
did
know
her
he
had
no
hope
of
ever
knowing
her
but
he
knew
her
better
than
he
knew
any
one
else
in
the
world
she
became
the
absorbing
subject
of
his
thoughts
the
heroine
of
his
dreams
she
became
in
fact
the
supreme
influence
of
his
the
duchessa
eyes
had
not
lost
their
intentness
while
he
was
speaking
now
that
he
had
finished
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
mused
for
a
moment
in
silence
at
last
she
looked
up
again
it
as
strange
as
anything
i
have
ever
heard
she
said
furiously
strange
and
romantic
and
interesting
but
but
she
frowned
a
little
hesitating
between
a
choice
of
questions
oh
it
a
story
all
compact
of
peter
threw
out
laughing
she
let
the
remark
pass
her
she
had
settled
upon
her
question
but
how
could
he
endure
such
a
situation
she
asked
how
could
he
sit
still
under
it
did
he
try
in
any
way
did
he
make
any
effort
at
all
to
to
find
her
out
to
discover
who
she
was
to
get
introduced
to
her
i
should
think
he
could
never
have
rested
i
should
think
he
would
have
moved
heaven
and
what
could
he
do
tell
me
a
single
thing
he
could
have
done
said
peter
society
has
made
no
provision
for
a
case
like
his
it
absurd
but
there
it
is
you
see
a
woman
somewhere
you
long
to
make
her
acquaintance
and
there
no
natural
bar
to
your
doing
so
you
a
presentable
man
she
what
they
call
a
lady
you
both
more
or
less
of
the
same
monde
yet
there
positively
no
way
known
by
which
you
can
contrive
it
unless
chance
mere
fortuitous
chance
just
happens
to
drop
a
common
acquaintance
between
you
at
the
right
time
and
place
chance
in
wildmay
case
happened
to
drop
all
the
common
acquaintances
they
may
possibly
have
had
at
a
deplorable
distance
he
was
alone
on
each
of
the
occasions
when
he
saw
her
there
was
no
one
he
could
ask
to
introduce
him
there
was
no
one
he
could
apply
to
for
information
concerning
her
he
could
very
well
follow
her
carriage
through
the
streets
dog
her
to
her
lair
like
a
detective
well
what
then
the
duchessa
was
playing
with
her
fan
again
no
she
agreed
i
suppose
it
was
hopeless
but
it
seems
rather
hard
on
the
poor
man
rather
baffling
and
the
poor
man
thought
it
so
to
be
sure
said
peter
he
fretted
and
fumed
a
good
deal
and
kicked
against
the
pricks
here
there
now
anon
he
would
enjoy
his
brief
little
vision
of
her
then
she
would
vanish
into
the
deep
inane
so
in
the
end
he
had
to
take
it
out
in
something
he
took
it
out
in
writing
a
book
about
her
he
propped
up
a
mental
portrait
of
her
on
his
desk
before
him
and
translated
it
into
the
character
of
pauline
in
that
way
he
was
able
to
spend
long
delightful
hours
alone
with
her
every
day
in
a
kind
of
metaphysical
intimacy
he
had
never
heard
her
voice
but
now
he
heard
it
as
often
as
pauline
opened
her
lips
he
owned
her
he
possessed
her
she
lived
under
his
roof
she
was
always
waiting
for
him
in
his
study
she
is
real
to
you
she
was
inexpressibly
miraculously
real
to
him
he
saw
her
knew
her
felt
her
realised
her
in
every
detail
of
her
mind
her
soul
her
person
down
to
the
very
intonations
of
her
speech
down
to
the
veins
in
her
hands
the
rings
on
her
fingers
down
to
her
very
furs
and
laces
the
of
her
skirts
the
scent
upon
her
he
had
numbered
the
hairs
of
her
head
again
the
duchessa
mused
for
a
while
in
silence
opening
and
shutting
her
fan
and
gazing
into
its
opals
i
am
thinking
of
it
from
the
woman
point
of
view
she
said
by
and
by
to
have
played
such
a
part
in
a
man
life
and
never
to
have
dreamed
it
never
even
very
likely
to
have
dreamed
that
such
a
man
existed
for
it
entirely
possible
she
did
notice
him
on
those
occasions
when
he
saw
her
and
to
have
been
the
subject
of
such
a
novel
and
never
to
have
dreamed
that
either
to
have
read
the
novel
perhaps
without
dreaming
for
an
instant
that
there
was
any
sort
of
connection
between
pauline
and
herself
or
else
what
would
almost
be
stranger
still
not
to
have
read
the
novel
not
to
have
heard
of
it
to
have
inspired
such
a
book
such
a
beautiful
book
yet
to
remain
in
sheer
unconscious
ignorance
that
there
was
such
a
book
oh
i
think
it
is
even
more
extraordinary
from
the
woman
point
of
view
than
from
the
man
there
is
something
almost
terrifying
about
it
to
have
had
such
an
influence
on
the
destiny
of
someone
you
never
heard
of
there
a
kind
of
intangible
sense
of
a
there
is
also
perhaps
laughed
peter
a
kind
of
intangible
sense
of
a
liberty
taken
i
bound
to
say
i
think
wildmay
was
decidedly
at
his
ease
to
appropriate
in
that
cool
fashion
the
personality
of
a
total
stranger
but
artists
are
the
most
unprincipled
folk
unhung
ils
prennent
leur
bien
la
ou
ils
le
oh
no
said
the
duchessa
i
think
she
was
fair
game
one
can
carry
delicacy
too
far
he
was
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
his
discovery
for
after
all
it
was
a
discovery
was
it
you
have
said
yourself
how
indispensable
the
eye
of
the
beholder
is
seeing
eye
i
think
indeed
the
whole
affair
speaks
extremely
well
for
wildmay
it
is
not
every
man
who
would
be
capable
of
so
purely
intellectual
a
passion
i
suppose
one
must
call
his
feeling
for
her
a
passion
it
indicates
a
distinction
in
his
nature
he
can
hardly
be
a
mere
materialist
but
but
i
think
it
that
he
never
met
oh
but
that
the
continuation
of
the
story
said
peter
he
did
meet
her
in
the
end
you
he
did
meet
her
cried
the
duchessa
starting
up
with
a
sudden
access
of
interest
whilst
her
eyes
lightened
he
did
meet
her
oh
you
must
tell
me
about
and
just
at
this
crisis
the
cardinal
and
emilia
appeared
climbing
the
terrace
steps
bother
exclaimed
the
duchessa
under
her
breath
then
to
peter
it
will
have
to
be
for
another
time
unless
i
die
of
the
after
the
necessary
greetings
were
transacted
another
elderly
priest
joined
the
company
a
tall
burly
rather
florid
man
mentioned
when
peter
was
introduced
to
him
as
monsignor
langshawe
this
really
is
her
chaplain
peter
concluded
then
a
servant
brought
tea
ah
diamond
diamond
you
little
know
what
mischief
you
might
have
wrought
he
admonished
himself
as
he
walked
home
through
the
level
sunshine
in
another
instant
if
we
not
been
interrupted
you
would
have
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
the
premature
escape
of
the
cat
from
the
bag
would
spoil
and
he
hugged
himself
as
one
snatched
from
peril
in
a
qualm
of
retroactive
terror
at
the
same
time
he
was
filled
with
a
kind
of
exultancy
all
that
he
had
hoped
had
come
to
pass
and
more
vastly
more
not
only
had
he
been
received
as
a
friend
at
ventirose
but
he
had
been
encouraged
to
tell
her
a
part
at
least
of
the
story
by
which
her
life
and
his
were
so
curiously
connected
and
he
had
been
snatched
from
the
peril
of
telling
her
too
much
the
day
was
not
yet
when
he
could
safely
say
mutato
nomine
would
the
day
ever
be
but
meanwhile
just
to
have
told
her
the
first
ten
lines
of
that
story
he
could
not
help
feeling
somehow
advanced
matters
tremendously
somehow
put
a
new
face
on
matters
the
hour
for
which
the
ages
sighed
may
not
be
so
far
away
as
you
think
he
said
to
marietta
the
curtain
has
risen
upon
act
three
i
fancy
i
can
perceive
faint
glimmerings
of
the
beginning
of
the
xix
all
that
evening
something
which
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
noticing
especially
when
it
was
present
to
him
certainly
he
had
paid
no
conscious
attention
to
its
details
kept
recurring
and
recurring
to
peter
memory
the
appearance
of
the
at
ventirose
the
white
awning
with
the
blue
sky
at
its
edges
the
sunny
park
beyond
the
carpets
on
the
marble
pavement
the
wicker
chairs
with
their
bright
cushions
the
table
with
its
books
and
bibelots
the
yellow
french
books
a
paperknife
a
silver
paperweight
a
crystal
a
bowlful
of
drooping
poppies
and
the
marble
balustrade
with
its
delicate
tracery
of
leaves
and
tendrils
where
the
jessamine
twined
round
its
pillars
this
kept
recurring
recurring
vividly
a
picture
that
he
could
see
without
closing
his
eyes
a
picture
with
a
very
decided
sentiment
like
the
gay
and
gleaming
facade
of
her
house
it
seemed
appropriate
to
her
it
seemed
in
its
fashion
to
express
her
nay
it
seemed
to
do
more
it
was
a
corner
of
her
environment
these
things
were
the
companions
the
witnesses
of
moments
of
her
life
phases
of
herself
which
were
hidden
from
peter
they
were
the
companions
and
witnesses
of
her
solitude
her
privacy
they
were
her
confidants
in
a
way
they
seemed
not
merely
to
express
her
therefore
but
to
be
continually
on
the
point
i
had
almost
said
of
betraying
her
at
all
events
if
he
could
only
understand
their
silent
language
they
would
prove
rich
in
precious
revelations
so
he
welcomed
their
recurrences
dwelt
upon
them
pondered
them
and
got
a
deep
if
somewhat
inarticulate
pleasure
from
them
on
thursday
as
he
approached
the
castle
the
last
fires
of
sunset
were
burning
in
the
sky
behind
it
the
long
irregular
mass
of
buildings
stood
out
in
varying
shades
of
blue
against
varying
dying
shades
of
red
the
grey
stone
dark
velvety
indigo
the
pink
stucco
pink
still
but
with
a
transparent
blue
penumbra
over
it
the
white
marble
palely
scintillantly
amethystine
and
if
he
was
interested
in
her
environment
now
he
could
study
it
to
his
heart
content
the
wide
marble
staircase
up
which
he
was
shown
with
its
crimson
carpet
and
the
big
mellow
painting
that
looked
as
if
it
might
be
a
titian
at
the
top
the
great
saloon
in
which
he
was
received
with
its
polished
mosaic
floor
its
frescoed
ceiling
its
panelling
its
hangings
and
upholsteries
of
yellow
brocade
its
satinwood
chairs
and
tables
its
bronzes
porcelains
embroideries
its
screens
and
mirrors
the
long
with
its
high
pointed
windows
its
slender
marble
columns
supporting
a
vaulted
roof
its
twinkling
candles
in
chandeliers
and
sconces
of
cloudy
venetian
glass
its
brilliant
table
its
flowers
and
their
colours
and
their
scents
he
could
study
her
environment
to
his
heart
content
indeed
or
to
his
heart
despair
for
all
this
had
rather
the
effect
of
chilling
of
depressing
him
it
was
very
splendid
it
was
very
luxurious
and
cheerful
it
was
appropriate
and
personal
to
her
if
you
like
no
doubt
in
its
fashion
in
its
measure
it
too
expressed
her
but
at
that
rate
it
expressed
her
in
an
aspect
which
peter
had
instinctively
made
it
his
habit
to
forget
which
he
by
no
means
found
it
inspiriting
to
remember
it
expressed
it
emphasised
her
wealth
her
rank
it
emphasised
the
distance
in
a
worldly
sense
between
her
and
himself
the
conventional
barriers
and
she
she
was
very
lovely
she
was
entirely
cordial
friendly
she
was
all
that
she
had
ever
been
and
yet
and
yet
well
somehow
she
seemed
indefinably
different
somehow
again
the
distance
the
barriers
were
emphasised
she
was
very
lovely
she
was
entirely
cordial
friendly
she
was
all
that
she
had
ever
been
but
somehow
she
seemed
very
much
the
great
lady
very
much
the
duchess
my
dear
man
he
said
to
himself
you
were
mad
to
dream
for
a
single
instant
that
there
was
the
remotest
possibility
of
anything
ever
the
only
other
guests
besides
the
cardinal
and
monsignor
langshawe
were
an
old
frenchwoman
with
beautiful
white
hair
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
villas
madame
de
lafere
and
a
young
pretty
witty
and
voluble
irishwoman
florence
from
an
hotel
at
spiaggia
in
deference
perhaps
to
the
cloth
of
the
two
ecclesiastics
none
of
the
women
were
in
full
and
there
was
no
when
they
went
in
to
dinner
the
dinner
itself
was
of
a
simplicity
which
peter
thought
admirable
and
which
of
course
he
attributed
to
his
duchessa
own
good
taste
he
was
not
yet
familiar
enough
with
the
black
aristocracy
of
italy
to
be
aware
that
in
the
matter
of
food
and
drink
simplicity
is
as
much
the
criterion
of
good
form
amongst
them
as
lavish
complexity
is
the
criterion
of
good
form
amongst
the
whites
the
conversation
i
believe
took
its
direction
chiefly
from
the
initiative
of
florence
with
great
sprightliness
and
humour
and
with
an
astonishing
courage
she
rallied
the
cardinal
upon
the
neglect
in
which
her
native
island
was
allowed
to
languish
by
the
powers
at
rome
the
most
catholic
country
in
three
hemispheres
to
be
sure
she
said
every
inch
of
its
soil
soaked
with
the
blood
of
martyrs
yet
you
not
added
an
irish
saint
to
the
calendar
for
i
see
you
blushing
to
think
how
many
ages
and
taken
sides
with
the
heretic
saxon
against
us
in
our
struggle
for
home
rule
which
i
blame
you
for
though
being
a
landowner
and
a
bit
of
an
absentee
i
a
traitorous
unionist
the
cardinal
laughingly
retorted
that
the
irish
were
far
too
fine
too
imaginative
and
poetical
a
race
to
be
bothered
with
material
questions
of
government
and
administration
they
should
leave
such
cares
to
the
stolid
practical
english
and
devote
the
leisure
they
would
thus
obtain
to
the
further
exercise
and
development
of
what
someone
had
called
the
starfire
of
the
celtic
ireland
should
look
upon
england
as
her
and
as
for
the
addition
of
irish
saints
to
the
calendar
the
was
their
excessive
number
is
an
embarrassment
of
riches
if
we
were
once
to
begin
we
could
never
leave
off
till
we
had
canonised
of
the
dead
monsignor
langshawe
at
this
making
jest
the
cue
for
earnest
spoke
up
for
scotland
and
deplored
the
delay
in
the
beatification
of
blessed
mary
the
official
beatification
he
discriminated
for
she
was
beatified
in
the
heart
of
every
true
catholic
scot
on
the
day
when
bloody
elizabeth
murdered
and
madame
de
lafere
put
in
a
plea
for
louis
xvi
and
the
little
dauphin
blessed
mary
bloody
elizabeth
laughed
the
duchessa
in
an
aside
to
peter
here
is
language
to
use
in
the
presence
of
a
protestant
oh
i
accustomed
to
elizabeth
said
he
was
it
a
word
of
cardinal
newman
yes
i
think
so
said
she
and
since
every
one
is
naming
his
candidate
for
the
calendar
you
have
named
mine
i
think
there
never
was
a
saintlier
saint
than
cardinal
what
is
your
eminence
attitude
towards
the
question
of
mixed
marriages
florence
asked
peter
pricked
up
his
ears
it
is
not
the
question
of
actuality
in
italy
that
it
is
in
england
his
eminence
replied
but
in
the
abstract
and
other
things
equal
my
attitude
would
of
course
be
one
of
and
yet
surely
contended
she
if
a
pious
catholic
girl
marries
a
protestant
man
she
has
a
hundred
chances
of
converting
him
i
do
know
said
the
cardinal
would
it
be
safer
to
let
the
conversion
precede
the
marriage
afterwards
i
afraid
he
would
have
a
hundred
chances
of
inducing
her
to
apostatise
or
at
least
of
rendering
her
not
if
she
had
a
spark
of
the
true
zeal
said
florence
any
wife
can
make
her
husband
life
a
burden
to
him
if
she
will
conscientiously
lay
herself
out
to
do
so
the
man
would
be
glad
to
submit
for
the
sake
of
peace
in
his
household
i
often
sigh
for
the
good
old
days
of
the
inquisition
but
it
still
possible
in
the
blessed
seclusion
of
the
family
circle
to
apply
the
rack
and
the
thumbscrew
in
a
modified
form
i
know
a
dozen
fine
young
protestant
men
in
london
whom
i
labouring
to
convert
and
i
feel
i
defeated
only
by
the
circumstance
that
i
not
in
a
position
to
lead
them
to
the
altar
in
the
full
meaning
of
the
a
dozen
the
cardinal
laughed
are
you
complicating
the
question
of
mixed
marriages
with
that
of
plural
marriage
was
merely
a
little
hibernicism
for
which
i
beg
your
indulgence
laughed
she
but
what
puts
the
most
spokes
in
a
proselytiser
wheel
is
the
faith
itself
if
we
only
deserved
the
reputation
for
sharp
practice
and
double
dealing
which
the
protestants
have
foisted
upon
us
it
would
be
roses
roses
all
the
way
why
are
we
forbidden
to
let
the
end
justify
the
means
and
where
are
those
accommodements
avec
le
ciel
of
which
we
heard
we
not
even
permitted
a
few
poor
accommodements
avec
le
look
at
my
uncle
face
whispered
the
duchessa
to
peter
the
cardinal
fine
old
face
was
all
alight
with
amusement
in
his
fondness
for
taking
things
by
their
humorous
end
he
has
met
an
it
will
be
a
grand
day
for
the
church
and
the
nations
when
we
have
an
irish
pope
florence
continued
a
good
stalwart
militant
irishman
is
what
needed
to
set
everything
right
with
a
sweet
irish
tongue
he
win
home
the
wandering
sheep
and
with
a
strong
irish
arm
he
drive
the
wolves
from
the
fold
it
he
that
would
soon
sweep
the
italians
out
of
the
italians
will
soon
be
swept
out
of
rome
by
the
natural
current
of
events
said
the
cardinal
but
an
irish
bishop
of
my
acquaintance
insists
that
we
have
already
had
many
irish
popes
without
knowing
it
of
all
the
greatest
popes
he
cries
they
must
have
had
irish
blood
he
perfectly
convinced
that
pius
the
ninth
was
irish
his
very
name
his
ferretti
was
merely
the
irish
name
farrity
italianised
the
good
bishop
says
no
one
but
an
irishman
he
insists
could
have
been
so
florence
looked
intensely
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
i
trying
to
think
of
the
original
irish
form
of
udeschini
she
declared
at
which
there
was
a
general
laugh
when
you
say
eminence
do
you
mean
that
we
may
hope
to
see
the
italians
driven
from
rome
in
our
time
enquired
madame
de
lafere
they
are
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
for
their
sins
the
cardinal
answered
when
the
crash
comes
and
it
ca
fail
to
come
before
many
years
there
will
necessarily
be
a
readjustment
i
do
not
believe
that
the
conscience
of
christendom
will
again
allow
peter
to
be
deprived
of
his
god
hasten
the
good
day
said
monsignor
langshawe
if
i
can
live
to
see
rome
restored
to
the
pope
i
shall
die
content
even
though
i
can
not
live
to
see
france
restored
to
the
king
said
the
old
frenchwoman
and
i
even
though
i
can
not
live
to
see
britain
restored
to
the
faith
said
the
monsignore
the
duchessa
smiled
at
peter
what
a
hotbed
of
ultramontanes
and
reactionaries
you
have
fallen
into
she
murmured
it
is
exhilarating
said
he
to
meet
people
who
have
even
when
you
regard
their
convictions
as
erroneous
she
asked
yes
even
then
he
answered
but
i
not
sure
i
regard
as
erroneous
the
convictions
i
have
heard
expressed
oh
she
wondered
would
you
like
to
see
rome
restored
to
the
pope
yes
said
he
decidedly
for
aesthetic
reasons
if
for
no
i
suppose
there
are
aesthetic
reasons
she
assented
but
we
of
course
think
there
are
conclusive
reasons
in
mere
i
do
doubt
there
are
conclusive
reasons
in
mere
justice
too
said
he
after
dinner
at
the
cardinal
invitation
the
duchessa
went
to
the
piano
and
played
bach
and
scarlatti
her
face
in
the
soft
candlelight
as
she
discoursed
that
luminous
lucid
music
peter
thought
but
what
do
lovers
always
think
of
their
ladies
faces
when
they
look
up
from
their
pianos
in
soft
candlelight
florence
taking
her
departure
said
to
the
cardinal
i
owe
your
eminence
the
two
proudest
days
of
my
life
the
first
was
when
i
read
in
the
paper
that
you
had
received
the
hat
and
i
was
able
to
boast
to
all
my
acquaintances
that
i
had
been
in
the
convent
with
your
niece
by
marriage
and
the
second
is
now
when
i
can
boast
forevermore
hereafter
that
i
enjoyed
the
honour
of
making
my
courtesy
to
so
said
peter
as
he
walked
home
through
the
dew
and
the
starlight
of
the
park
amid
the
phantom
perfumes
of
the
night
so
the
cardinal
does
approve
of
mixed
marriages
and
of
course
his
niece
does
either
but
what
can
it
matter
to
me
for
alas
and
alas
as
he
truly
said
it
hardly
a
question
of
and
he
lit
a
cigarette
xx
so
he
did
meet
her
after
all
the
duchessa
said
yes
he
met
her
in
the
end
peter
answered
they
were
seated
under
the
gay
white
awning
against
the
bright
perspective
of
lawn
lake
and
mountains
on
the
terrace
at
ventirose
where
peter
was
paying
his
the
august
day
was
hot
and
still
and
beautiful
a
day
made
of
gold
and
velvet
and
sweet
odours
the
duchessa
lay
back
languidly
among
the
crisp
silk
cushions
in
her
low
lounging
chair
and
peter
as
he
looked
at
her
told
himself
that
he
must
be
cautious
cautious
yes
he
met
her
in
the
end
he
said
well
and
then
she
questioned
with
a
show
of
eagerness
smiling
into
his
eyes
what
happened
did
she
come
up
to
his
expectations
or
was
she
just
the
usual
disappointment
i
have
been
pining
oh
but
pining
to
hear
the
continuation
of
the
she
smiled
into
his
eyes
and
his
heart
fluttered
i
must
be
cautious
he
told
himself
in
more
ways
than
one
this
is
a
crucial
at
the
same
time
as
a
very
part
of
his
caution
he
must
appear
entirely
nonchalant
and
candid
oh
no
tutt
altro
he
said
with
an
assumption
of
nonchalant
airiness
and
candid
promptness
she
bettered
his
expectations
she
surpassed
his
fondest
she
was
a
thousand
times
more
delightful
than
he
had
dreamed
though
as
you
know
he
had
dreamed
a
good
deal
pauline
de
fleuvieres
turned
out
to
be
the
feeblest
faintest
echo
of
the
duchessa
meditated
for
an
instant
it
seems
impossible
it
one
of
those
situations
in
which
a
disenchantment
seems
the
foregone
conclusion
she
said
at
last
it
seems
so
indeed
assented
peter
but
disenchantment
there
was
none
she
was
all
that
he
had
imagined
and
infinitely
more
she
was
the
substance
he
had
imagined
the
shadow
he
had
divined
her
as
it
were
from
a
single
angle
and
there
were
many
angles
pauline
was
the
pale
reflection
of
one
side
of
her
a
in
the
duchessa
shook
her
head
marvelling
and
smiled
again
you
pile
wonder
upon
wonder
she
said
that
the
reality
should
excel
the
poet
ideal
that
the
towers
which
looked
splendid
from
afar
with
all
the
glamour
of
distance
should
prove
to
be
more
splendid
still
on
close
inspection
it
dead
against
the
accepted
theory
of
things
and
that
any
woman
should
be
nicer
than
that
adorable
pauline
you
tax
belief
but
i
want
to
know
what
happened
had
she
read
his
book
nothing
happened
said
peter
i
warned
you
that
it
was
a
drama
without
action
a
good
deal
happened
no
doubt
in
wildmay
secret
soul
but
externally
nothing
they
simply
chatted
together
exchanged
the
time
o
day
like
any
pair
of
acquaintances
no
i
do
think
she
had
read
his
book
she
did
read
it
afterwards
and
liked
it
yes
she
said
she
liked
well
but
the
duchessa
pressed
him
insistently
when
she
discovered
the
part
she
had
had
in
its
composition
was
she
overwhelmed
was
she
immensely
interested
surprised
moved
she
leaned
forward
a
little
her
eyes
were
shining
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
so
that
between
their
warm
rosiness
peter
could
see
the
exquisite
white
line
of
her
teeth
his
heart
fluttered
again
i
must
be
cautious
cautious
he
remembered
and
made
a
strenuous
act
of
will
to
steady
himself
oh
she
never
discovered
that
he
said
what
exclaimed
the
duchessa
her
face
fell
her
eyes
darkened
with
dismay
with
incomprehension
do
you
you
do
mean
to
say
that
he
did
tell
her
there
was
reluctance
to
believe
there
was
a
conditional
implication
of
deep
reproach
in
her
voice
peter
had
to
repeat
his
act
of
will
how
could
he
tell
her
he
asked
she
frowned
at
him
with
reproach
that
was
explicit
now
and
a
kind
of
pained
astonishment
how
could
he
help
telling
her
she
cried
but
but
it
was
the
one
great
fact
between
them
but
it
was
a
fact
that
intimately
concerned
her
it
was
a
fact
of
her
own
destiny
but
it
was
her
right
to
be
told
do
you
seriously
mean
that
he
did
tell
her
but
why
did
he
what
could
have
possessed
him
there
was
something
like
a
tremor
in
her
voice
i
must
appear
entirely
nonchalant
and
candid
peter
remembered
i
fancy
he
was
possessed
in
some
measure
by
a
sense
of
the
liberty
he
had
taken
by
a
sense
of
what
one
might
perhaps
venture
to
qualify
as
his
for
if
it
was
already
a
liberty
to
embody
his
notion
of
her
in
a
novel
in
a
published
book
for
daws
to
peck
at
it
would
have
become
a
liberty
the
moment
he
informed
her
that
he
had
done
so
that
would
have
had
the
effect
of
making
her
a
kind
of
involuntary
particeps
oh
the
foolish
man
sighed
the
duchessa
with
a
rueful
shake
of
the
head
his
foolish
british
his
british
inability
to
put
himself
in
another
person
place
to
see
things
from
point
of
view
could
he
see
from
her
point
of
view
from
any
point
of
view
but
his
own
that
it
was
her
right
to
be
told
that
the
matter
affected
her
in
one
way
as
much
as
it
affected
him
in
another
that
since
she
had
influenced
since
she
had
contributed
to
his
life
and
his
art
as
she
had
it
was
her
right
to
know
it
could
he
see
that
his
his
real
began
when
he
withheld
from
her
that
great
strange
chapter
of
her
own
history
oh
he
ought
to
have
told
her
he
ought
to
have
told
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
giving
her
head
another
rueful
shake
and
gazed
ruefully
away
over
the
sunny
landscape
through
the
mellow
atmosphere
into
the
distance
peter
looked
at
her
and
then
quickly
for
caution
sake
looked
elsewhere
but
there
were
other
things
to
be
taken
into
account
he
said
the
duchessa
raised
her
eyes
what
other
things
they
gravely
questioned
would
his
telling
her
have
been
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
love
questioned
he
looking
at
the
on
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
a
declaration
of
love
she
considered
for
a
moment
yes
i
suppose
in
a
way
it
would
she
acknowledged
but
even
so
she
asked
after
another
moment
of
consideration
why
should
he
not
have
made
her
a
declaration
of
love
he
was
in
love
with
her
was
he
the
point
of
frank
interrogation
in
her
eyes
showed
clearly
showed
cruelly
how
detached
how
impersonal
her
interest
was
frantically
said
peter
for
caution
sake
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
peaks
of
monte
sfionto
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
in
a
fashion
of
course
from
the
beginning
but
after
he
met
her
he
fell
in
love
with
her
anew
his
mind
his
imagination
had
been
in
love
with
its
conception
of
her
but
now
he
the
man
loved
her
the
woman
herself
frantically
with
just
a
downright
common
human
love
there
were
circumstances
however
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
tell
her
what
circumstances
there
was
the
same
frank
look
of
interrogation
do
you
mean
that
she
was
married
no
not
that
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
he
pronounced
with
energy
she
was
a
the
duchessa
broke
into
an
amused
laugh
permit
me
to
admire
your
piety
she
said
and
peter
as
his
somewhat
outrageous
ejaculation
came
back
to
him
laughed
vaguely
too
but
then
she
went
on
what
else
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
she
was
a
widow
what
other
circumstance
could
have
tied
his
tongue
oh
he
answered
a
trifle
uneasily
a
multitude
of
circumstances
pretty
nearly
every
conventional
barrier
the
world
has
invented
existed
between
him
and
her
she
was
a
frightful
swell
for
one
a
frightful
swell
the
duchessa
raised
her
eyebrows
yes
said
peter
at
a
vertiginous
height
above
him
horribly
and
lone
in
the
social
he
tried
to
smile
what
could
that
matter
the
duchessa
objected
simply
mr
wildmay
is
a
how
do
you
know
he
is
peter
asked
thinking
to
create
a
diversion
of
course
he
is
he
must
be
no
one
but
a
gentleman
could
have
had
such
an
experience
could
have
written
such
a
book
and
besides
a
friend
of
yours
of
course
he
a
gentleman
returned
the
adroit
duchessa
but
there
are
degrees
of
gentleness
i
believe
said
peter
she
was
at
the
topmost
top
he
well
at
all
events
he
knew
his
place
he
had
too
much
humour
too
just
a
sense
of
proportion
to
contemplate
offering
her
his
a
gentleman
can
offer
his
hand
to
any
woman
under
royalty
said
the
duchessa
he
can
to
be
sure
and
he
can
also
see
it
declined
with
thanks
peter
answered
but
it
was
merely
her
rank
she
was
horribly
rich
besides
and
then
and
then
there
were
ten
thousand
other
impediments
but
the
chief
of
them
all
i
daresay
was
wildmay
fear
lest
an
avowal
of
his
attachment
should
lead
to
his
exile
from
her
presence
and
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
be
faint
heart
the
duchessa
said
he
ought
to
have
told
her
the
case
was
peculiar
was
unique
ordinary
rules
could
apply
to
it
and
how
could
he
be
sure
after
all
that
she
would
have
despised
the
conventional
barriers
as
you
call
them
every
man
gets
the
wife
he
deserves
and
certainly
he
had
gone
a
long
way
towards
deserving
her
she
could
have
felt
quite
indifferent
to
him
if
he
had
told
her
quite
indifferent
to
the
man
who
had
drawn
that
magnificent
pauline
from
his
vision
of
her
no
woman
could
be
entirely
proof
against
a
compliment
like
that
and
i
insist
that
it
was
her
right
to
know
he
should
simply
have
told
her
the
story
of
his
book
and
of
her
part
in
it
she
would
have
inferred
the
rest
he
need
have
mentioned
love
the
well
said
peter
it
is
not
always
too
late
to
mend
he
may
tell
her
some
fine
day
and
in
his
soul
two
voices
were
contending
tell
her
tell
her
tell
her
tell
her
now
at
once
and
abide
your
chances
urged
one
no
no
no
do
nothing
of
the
kind
protested
the
second
she
is
arguing
the
point
for
its
abstract
interest
she
is
a
hundred
miles
from
dreaming
that
you
are
the
man
hundreds
of
miles
from
dreaming
that
she
is
the
woman
if
she
had
the
least
suspicion
of
that
she
would
sing
a
song
as
different
as
may
be
caution
he
looked
at
her
warm
and
fragrant
and
radiant
in
her
soft
white
gown
in
her
low
so
near
so
near
to
him
he
looked
at
her
glowing
eyes
her
red
lips
her
rich
brown
hair
at
the
of
her
skin
at
the
delicate
blue
veins
in
her
forehead
at
her
fine
white
hands
clasped
loosely
together
in
her
lap
at
the
flowing
lines
of
her
figure
with
its
supple
grace
and
strength
and
behind
her
surrounding
her
accessory
to
her
he
was
conscious
of
the
golden
august
world
in
the
golden
august
weather
of
the
green
park
and
the
pure
sunshine
and
the
sweet
still
air
of
the
blue
lake
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
mountains
with
their
shadows
of
the
long
marble
terrace
and
the
gleaming
marble
facade
of
the
house
and
the
marble
balustrade
with
the
jessamine
twining
round
its
columns
the
picture
was
very
beautiful
but
something
was
wanting
to
perfect
its
beauty
and
the
name
of
the
something
that
was
wanting
sang
itself
in
poignant
iteration
to
the
beating
of
his
pulses
and
he
longed
and
longed
to
tell
her
and
he
dared
not
and
he
hesitated
and
while
he
was
hesitating
the
pounding
of
hoofs
and
the
grinding
of
on
gravel
reached
his
ears
and
so
the
situation
was
saved
or
the
opportunity
lost
as
you
choose
to
think
it
for
next
minute
a
servant
appeared
on
the
terrace
and
announced
florence
and
shortly
after
that
lady
arrival
peter
took
his
leave
xxi
well
trixie
and
is
one
to
congratulate
you
asked
florence
congratulate
me
on
what
asked
beatrice
on
what
indeed
cried
the
vivacious
irishwoman
do
try
to
pull
the
wool
over
the
eyes
of
an
old
campaigner
like
beatrice
looked
blank
i
ca
in
the
least
think
what
you
mean
she
said
get
along
with
you
cried
florence
and
she
brandished
her
sunshade
threateningly
on
your
engagement
to
what
this
his
name
is
to
be
she
glanced
indicatively
down
the
lawn
in
the
direction
of
retreating
tweeds
beatrice
had
looked
blank
but
now
she
looked
first
perhaps
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
a
second
startled
then
gently
compassionately
ironical
my
poor
kate
are
you
out
of
your
senses
she
enquired
in
accents
of
concern
nodding
her
head
with
a
feint
of
pensive
pity
not
i
returned
florence
cheerfully
confident
but
i
thinking
i
could
lay
my
finger
on
a
young
englishman
less
than
a
mile
from
here
who
very
nearly
is
has
he
asked
you
yet
bete
beatrice
murmured
pitifully
nodding
again
ah
well
if
he
has
it
merely
a
question
of
time
when
he
will
said
florence
you
only
to
notice
the
famished
gaze
with
which
he
devours
you
to
see
his
condition
but
do
try
to
hoodwink
me
do
pretend
that
this
is
news
to
news
scoffed
beatrice
it
news
and
nonsense
the
product
of
your
irrepressible
imagination
as
you
call
him
and
i
are
the
barest
acquaintances
he
our
temporary
neighbour
the
tenant
for
the
season
of
villa
floriano
the
house
you
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
below
there
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
is
he
now
really
and
that
very
interesting
too
but
i
denying
florence
smiled
with
derisive
sweetness
the
fact
of
his
being
the
tenant
of
the
house
i
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
though
a
valuable
acquisition
to
my
stores
of
knowledge
does
explain
away
his
famished
glance
unless
indeed
he
behind
with
the
rent
but
even
then
it
not
famished
he
look
but
merely
anxious
and
persuasive
i
a
landlord
myself
no
trixie
dear
you
made
roast
meat
of
the
poor
fellow
heart
as
the
poetical
persians
express
it
and
if
he
has
told
you
so
yet
with
his
tongue
he
tells
the
whole
world
so
with
his
eyes
as
often
as
he
allows
them
to
rest
on
their
loadstone
your
face
you
can
see
the
sparks
and
the
smoke
escaping
from
them
as
though
they
were
chimneys
if
you
not
observed
that
for
yourself
it
can
only
be
that
excessive
modesty
has
rendered
you
blind
the
man
is
head
over
ears
in
love
with
you
nonsense
or
bonsense
that
is
the
sober
beatrice
laughed
i
sorry
to
destroy
a
romance
kate
she
said
but
alas
for
the
pretty
one
you
woven
i
happen
to
know
that
so
far
from
being
in
love
with
me
marchdale
is
quite
desperately
in
love
with
another
woman
he
was
talking
to
me
about
her
the
moment
before
you
was
he
indeed
and
you
the
barest
acquaintances
quizzed
florence
pulling
a
face
well
well
she
went
on
thoughtfully
if
he
in
love
with
another
woman
that
settles
my
last
remaining
doubt
it
can
only
be
that
the
other
woman
beatrice
shook
her
head
and
laughed
again
is
that
what
they
call
an
irishism
she
asked
with
polite
curiosity
and
an
irishism
is
a
very
good
thing
too
when
employed
with
intention
retorted
her
friend
did
he
just
chance
now
in
a
casual
way
to
mention
the
other
woman
name
i
wonder
oh
you
perverse
and
generation
beatrice
laughed
what
can
his
mentioning
or
not
mentioning
her
name
signify
for
since
in
love
with
her
it
hardly
likely
that
he
in
love
with
you
or
me
at
the
same
time
is
it
that
as
may
be
but
i
wager
i
could
make
a
shrewd
guess
at
her
name
myself
and
what
else
did
he
tell
you
about
her
he
told
me
nothing
but
i
warrant
i
could
paint
her
portrait
she
a
fine
figure
of
a
young
englishwoman
and
she
stands
about
in
her
shoes
there
an
expression
of
great
malice
and
humour
in
her
physiognomy
and
a
kind
of
haughtiness
in
the
poise
of
her
head
she
a
bit
of
a
grande
dame
into
the
bargain
something
like
an
duchess
for
example
monstrously
rich
and
she
adds
you
be
surprised
to
learn
to
her
other
fascinations
that
of
being
a
widow
faith
the
men
are
so
fond
of
widows
it
a
marvel
to
me
that
we
ever
married
at
all
until
we
reach
that
condition
and
there
if
you
like
is
another
irishism
for
you
but
what
this
methinks
a
rosy
blush
mantles
my
lady
brow
have
i
touched
the
heel
of
achilles
she
is
a
widow
he
told
you
she
was
a
widow
but
bless
us
and
save
us
what
come
to
you
now
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
what
is
it
good
heavens
gasped
beatrice
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
stared
with
horrified
eyes
into
space
good
good
heavens
o
donovan
florence
leaned
forward
and
took
her
hand
what
is
it
my
dear
what
come
to
you
she
asked
in
alarm
beatrice
gave
a
kind
of
groan
it
absurd
it
impossible
she
said
and
yet
if
by
any
ridiculous
chance
you
should
be
right
it
too
horribly
she
repeated
her
groan
if
by
any
ridiculous
chance
you
are
right
the
man
will
think
that
i
have
been
leading
him
on
leading
him
on
florence
suppressed
a
shriek
of
ecstatic
mirth
there
no
question
about
my
being
right
she
averred
soberly
he
wears
his
heart
behind
his
eyeglass
and
whoso
runs
may
read
well
then
began
beatrice
with
an
air
of
desperation
but
no
she
broke
off
you
ca
be
right
it
impossible
impossible
wait
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
you
shall
see
for
go
on
said
florence
assuming
an
attitude
of
devout
attention
which
she
retained
while
beatrice
not
without
certain
starts
and
hesitations
recounted
the
fond
tale
of
peter
novel
and
of
the
woman
who
had
suggested
the
character
of
pauline
but
of
course
cried
the
irishwoman
when
the
tale
was
finished
and
this
time
her
shriek
of
mirth
of
glee
was
not
suppressed
of
course
you
miracle
of
unsuspecting
innocence
the
man
would
never
have
breathed
a
whisper
of
the
affair
to
any
soul
alive
save
to
his
heroine
herself
let
alone
to
you
if
you
and
she
were
not
the
same
couple
that
with
the
eyes
he
makes
at
you
and
you
got
assurance
twice
assured
you
ought
to
have
guessed
it
from
the
first
syllable
he
uttered
and
when
he
went
on
about
her
exalted
station
and
her
fabulous
wealth
oh
my
ingenue
oh
my
guileless
lambkin
and
you
trixie
belfont
your
famous
wit
where
are
your
famous
intuitions
but
do
you
see
wailed
beatrice
do
you
see
the
utterly
odious
position
this
leaves
me
in
i
been
urging
him
with
all
my
might
to
tell
her
i
said
oh
the
things
i
said
she
shuddered
visibly
i
said
that
differences
of
rank
and
fortune
could
she
gave
a
melancholy
laugh
i
said
that
very
likely
she
accept
him
i
said
she
could
help
being
oh
my
dear
my
dear
he
think
of
course
he
ca
help
thinking
that
i
was
encouraging
him
that
i
was
coming
halfway
to
meet
hush
hush
it
not
so
bad
as
that
said
florence
soothingly
for
surely
as
i
understand
it
the
man
does
dream
that
you
knew
it
was
about
himself
he
was
speaking
he
always
talked
of
the
book
as
by
a
friend
of
his
and
you
never
let
him
suspect
that
you
had
pierced
his
beatrice
frowned
for
an
instant
putting
this
consideration
in
its
place
in
her
troubled
mind
then
suddenly
a
light
of
intense
of
immense
relief
broke
in
her
face
thank
goodness
she
sighed
i
had
forgotten
no
he
does
dream
that
but
oh
the
fright
i
had
he
tell
you
all
the
same
said
florence
no
he
never
tell
me
now
i
am
forewarned
forearmed
i
give
him
no
chance
beatrice
answered
yes
and
what
more
you
marry
him
said
her
friend
kate
do
descend
to
imbecilities
cried
beatrice
you
marry
him
reiterated
florence
calmly
end
by
marrying
him
if
you
human
and
i
seldom
known
a
human
being
who
was
more
so
it
not
in
flesh
and
blood
to
remain
unmoved
by
a
tribute
such
as
that
man
has
paid
you
the
first
thing
you
do
will
be
to
the
novel
otherwise
i
request
the
loan
of
it
myself
for
i
naturally
curious
to
compare
the
wrought
ring
with
the
virgin
gold
but
i
know
it
the
wrought
ring
the
virgin
gold
will
itself
be
wanting
directly
it
alone
and
then
the
poison
will
work
and
end
by
marrying
in
the
first
place
replied
beatrice
firmly
i
shall
never
marry
any
one
that
is
absolutely
certain
in
the
next
place
i
shall
not
the
novel
and
to
prove
that
i
sha
i
shall
insist
on
your
taking
it
with
you
when
you
leave
and
finally
i
nowhere
near
convinced
that
you
right
about
my
being
well
you
might
as
well
say
the
raw
material
the
rough
ore
as
the
virgin
gold
it
only
a
bare
possibility
but
even
the
possibility
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
now
that
it
has
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
i
shall
know
how
to
prevent
any
possible
in
the
first
place
said
florence
with
equal
firmness
wild
horses
could
induce
me
to
take
the
novel
wait
till
alone
a
hundred
questions
about
it
will
come
flocking
to
your
mind
you
be
miserable
if
you
had
it
to
refer
to
in
the
next
place
the
poison
will
work
and
work
say
what
you
will
it
flattery
that
wins
us
in
the
third
place
he
tell
you
finally
you
make
a
good
catholic
of
him
and
marry
him
it
absurd
it
iniquitous

oh
my
good
kate
my
sweet
kate
my
incorrigible
kate
what
an
extravagantly
silly
kate
you
can
be
when
the
mood
takes
you
beatrice
laughed
kate
me
as
many
kates
as
you
like
the
man
is
really
not
he
has
a
nice
lithe
springy
figure
and
a
clean
complexion
and
an
open
brow
and
if
there
a
suggestion
of
superciliousness
in
the
tilt
of
his
nose
of
scepticism
in
the
twirl
of
his
moustaches
and
of
obstinacy
in
the
squareness
of
his
chin
ma
foi
you
must
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
besides
he
has
decent
hair
and
plenty
of
it
he
not
go
bald
and
he
dresses
well
and
wears
his
clothes
with
an
air
in
short
make
a
very
handsome
couple
anyhow
when
your
family
are
gathered
round
the
evening
lamp
i
stake
my
fortune
on
it
but
i
can
foretell
the
name
of
the
book
they
find
trixie
belfont
reading
laughed
florence
for
a
few
minutes
after
her
friend
had
left
her
beatrice
sat
still
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
and
gazed
with
fixed
eyes
at
monte
sfiorito
then
she
rose
and
walked
briskly
backwards
and
forwards
for
a
while
up
and
down
the
terrace
presently
she
came
to
a
standstill
and
leaning
on
the
balustrade
while
one
of
her
feet
kept
lightly
tapping
the
pavement
looked
off
again
towards
the
mountain
the
prospect
was
well
worth
her
attention
with
its
blue
and
green
and
gold
its
wood
and
water
its
snows
its
spaciousness
and
its
atmosphere
in
the
sky
a
million
fluffy
little
cloudlets
floated
like
a
flock
of
fantastic
birds
with
tinted
plumage
the
shadows
were
lengthening
now
the
sunshine
glanced
from
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lake
as
from
burnished
metal
and
falling
on
the
coloured
sails
of
the
made
them
gleam
like
sails
of
crimson
silk
but
i
wonder
how
much
of
this
beatrice
really
saw
she
plucked
an
oleander
from
one
of
the
tall
marble
urns
set
along
the
balustrade
and
pressed
the
pink
blossom
against
her
face
and
closing
her
eyes
breathed
in
its
perfume
then
she
let
it
drop
over
the
terrace
upon
the
path
below
it
impossible
she
said
suddenly
aloud
at
last
she
went
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
there
she
took
a
book
from
the
table
and
sank
into
a
deep
and
began
to
turn
the
pages
but
when
by
and
by
approaching
footsteps
became
audible
in
the
corridor
without
beatrice
hastily
shut
the
book
thrust
it
back
upon
the
table
and
caught
up
another
so
that
emilia
manfredi
entering
found
her
reading
monsieur
anatole
france
etui
de
emilia
she
said
i
wish
you
would
translate
the
i
jongleur
de
notre
dame
into
xxii
peter
we
may
suppose
returned
to
villa
floriano
that
afternoon
in
a
state
of
some
excitement
he
ought
to
have
told
her
it
was
her
right
to
be
told
what
could
her
rank
matter
a
gentleman
can
offer
his
hand
to
any
woman
she
would
have
despised
the
conventional
barriers
no
woman
could
be
proof
against
such
a
compliment
the
case
was
peculiar
ordinary
rules
could
not
apply
to
it
every
man
gets
the
wife
he
deserves
and
he
had
certainly
gone
a
long
way
towards
deserving
her
he
should
simply
have
told
her
the
story
of
his
book
and
of
her
part
in
it
he
need
have
mentioned
love
she
would
have
understood
the
duchessa
voice
clear
and
cool
and
sounded
perpetually
in
his
ears
the
words
she
had
spoken
the
arguments
she
had
urged
repeated
and
repeated
themselves
danced
round
and
round
in
his
memory
ought
i
to
have
told
her
then
and
there
shall
i
go
to
her
and
tell
her
he
tried
to
think
but
he
could
not
think
his
faculties
were
in
a
whirl
he
could
by
no
means
command
them
he
could
only
wait
inert
while
the
dance
went
on
it
was
an
extremely
riotous
dance
the
duchessa
conversation
was
reproduced
without
sequence
without
coherence
scattered
fragments
of
it
were
flashed
before
him
fitfully
in
swift
disorder
if
he
would
attempt
to
seize
upon
one
of
those
fragments
to
detain
and
fix
it
for
consideration
a
speech
of
hers
a
look
an
inflection
then
the
whole
experience
suddenly
lost
its
outlines
his
recollection
of
it
became
a
jumble
and
he
was
left
as
it
were
intellectually
gasping
he
walked
about
his
garden
he
went
into
the
house
he
came
out
he
walked
about
again
he
went
in
and
dressed
for
dinner
he
sat
on
his
rustic
bench
he
smoked
cigarette
after
cigarette
ought
i
to
have
told
her
ought
i
to
tell
her
at
moments
there
would
come
a
lull
in
the
turmoil
an
interval
of
quiet
of
apparent
clearness
and
the
answer
would
seem
perfectly
plain
of
course
you
ought
to
tell
her
tell
her
and
all
will
be
well
she
has
put
herself
in
the
supposititious
woman
place
and
she
says
ought
to
tell
her
she
says
it
earnestly
vehemently
that
means
that
if
she
were
the
woman
she
would
wish
to
be
told
she
will
despise
the
conventional
barriers
she
will
be
touched
she
will
be
moved
woman
could
be
proof
against
such
a
compliment
go
to
her
and
tell
her
and
all
will
be
at
these
moments
he
would
look
up
towards
the
castle
and
picture
the
morrow
consummation
and
his
heart
would
have
a
convulsion
imagination
flew
on
the
wings
of
his
desire
she
stood
before
him
in
all
her
sumptuous
womanhood
tender
and
strong
and
glowing
as
he
spoke
her
eyes
lightened
her
eyes
burned
the
blood
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
her
lips
parted
then
she
whispered
something
and
his
heart
leapt
terribly
and
he
called
her
name
beatrice
beatrice
her
name
expressed
the
inexpressible
the
adoring
passion
the
wild
hunger
and
wild
triumph
of
his
soul
but
now
she
was
moving
towards
him
she
was
holding
out
her
hands
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
he
held
her
yielding
body
in
his
arms
and
his
heart
leapt
terribly
terribly
and
he
wondered
how
he
could
endure
how
he
could
live
through
the
hateful
hours
that
must
elapse
before
tomorrow
would
be
but
hearts
after
leaps
presently
the
whirl
would
begin
again
and
then
by
and
by
in
another
lull
a
contrary
answer
would
seem
equally
plain
tell
her
indeed
my
dear
man
are
you
mad
she
would
simply
be
amazed
struck
dumb
by
your
presumption
i
can
see
from
here
her
incredulity
i
can
see
the
scorn
with
which
she
would
wither
you
it
has
never
dimly
occurred
to
her
as
conceivable
that
you
would
venture
to
be
in
love
with
her
that
you
would
dare
to
lift
your
eyes
to
her
you
who
are
nothing
to
her
who
is
all
yes
nothing
nobody
in
her
view
you
are
just
a
harmless
nobody
whose
society
she
tolerates
for
kindness
sake
and
faute
de
mieux
it
is
precisely
because
she
deems
you
a
nobody
because
she
is
profoundly
conscious
of
the
gulf
that
separates
you
from
her
that
she
can
condescend
to
be
amiably
familiar
if
you
were
of
a
rank
even
remotely
approximating
to
her
own
she
would
be
a
thousand
times
more
circumspect
remember
she
does
not
dream
that
you
are
felix
wildmay
he
is
a
mere
name
to
her
and
his
story
is
an
amusing
little
romance
perfectly
external
to
herself
which
she
discusses
with
entirely
impersonal
interest
tell
her
by
all
means
if
you
like
say
am
wildmay
you
are
pauline
and
see
how
amazed
she
will
be
and
how
incensed
and
how
then
he
would
look
up
at
the
castle
stonily
in
a
mood
of
desperate
renunciation
and
vaguely
meditate
packing
his
belongings
and
going
home
to
england
at
other
moments
a
third
answer
would
seem
the
plain
one
something
between
these
extremes
of
optimism
and
pessimism
a
compromise
it
not
a
reconciliation
come
let
us
be
calm
let
us
be
judicial
the
consequences
of
our
actions
here
below
if
hardly
ever
so
good
as
we
could
hope
are
hardly
ever
so
bad
as
we
might
fear
let
us
regard
this
matter
in
the
light
of
that
guiding
principle
true
she
does
dream
that
you
are
wildmay
true
if
you
were
abruptly
to
say
to
her
am
wildmay
you
are
the
woman
she
would
be
astonished
even
if
you
will
at
first
more
or
less
taken
aback
disconcerted
but
indignant
why
what
is
this
gulf
that
separates
you
from
her
what
are
these
conventional
barriers
of
which
you
make
so
much
she
is
a
duchess
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
lord
and
she
is
rich
well
all
that
is
to
be
regretted
but
you
are
neither
a
plebeian
nor
a
pauper
yourself
you
are
a
man
of
good
birth
you
are
a
man
of
some
parts
and
you
have
a
decent
income
it
amounts
to
this
she
is
a
great
lady
you
are
a
small
gentleman
in
ordinary
circumstances
to
be
sure
so
small
a
gentleman
could
not
ask
so
great
a
lady
to
become
his
wife
but
here
the
circumstances
are
not
ordinary
destiny
has
meddled
in
the
business
small
gentleman
though
you
are
an
unusual
and
subtle
has
been
established
between
you
and
your
great
lady
she
herself
says
rules
can
not
apply
he
ought
to
tell
her
very
good
tell
her
she
will
be
astonished
but
she
will
see
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
resentment
and
though
the
odds
are
of
course
a
hundred
to
one
that
she
will
not
accept
you
still
she
must
treat
you
as
an
honourable
suitor
and
whether
she
accepts
you
or
rejects
you
it
is
better
to
tell
her
and
to
have
it
over
than
to
go
on
forever
dangling
this
way
like
the
poor
cat
in
the
adage
tell
her
put
your
fate
to
the
touch
hope
nothing
fear
nothing
and
bow
to
the
but
even
this
temperate
answer
provoked
its
the
odds
are
a
hundred
to
one
a
thousand
to
one
that
she
will
not
accept
you
and
if
you
tell
her
and
she
does
not
accept
you
she
will
not
allow
you
to
see
her
any
more
you
will
be
exiled
from
her
presence
and
i
thought
you
did
not
wish
to
be
exiled
from
her
presence
you
would
stake
then
this
great
privilege
the
privilege
of
seeing
her
of
knowing
her
upon
chance
that
has
a
thousand
to
one
against
it
you
make
light
of
the
conventional
barriers
but
the
principal
barrier
of
them
all
you
are
forgetting
she
is
a
roman
catholic
and
a
devout
one
marry
a
protestant
she
would
as
soon
think
of
marrying
a
paynim
in
the
end
no
doubt
a
kind
of
exhaustion
followed
upon
his
excitement
questions
and
answers
suspended
themselves
and
he
could
only
look
up
towards
ventirose
and
dumbly
wish
that
he
was
there
the
distance
was
so
trifling
in
five
minutes
he
could
traverse
it
the
law
seemed
absurd
and
arbitrary
which
condemned
him
to
sit
apart
free
only
to
look
and
wish
it
was
in
this
condition
of
mind
that
marietta
found
him
when
she
came
to
announce
dinner
peter
gave
himself
a
shake
the
sight
of
the
brown
old
woman
with
her
homely
friendly
face
brought
him
back
to
small
things
to
actual
things
and
that
if
it
was
a
comfort
was
at
any
rate
a
relief
dinner
he
questioned
do
peris
at
the
gates
of
eden
dine
the
soup
is
on
the
table
said
marietta
he
rose
casting
a
last
glance
towards
the
castle
towers
and
battlements
bosomed
high
in
tufted
trees
where
perhaps
some
beauty
lies
the
cynosure
of
neighbouring
he
repeated
the
lines
in
an
undertone
and
went
in
to
dinner
and
then
the
restorative
spirit
of
nonsense
descended
upon
him
marietta
he
asked
what
is
your
attitude
towards
the
question
of
mixed
marriages
marietta
wrinkled
her
brow
mixed
marriages
what
is
that
signorino
marriages
between
catholics
and
protestants
he
explained
protestants
her
brow
was
still
a
network
what
things
are
they
they
are
things
or
perhaps
it
would
be
less
invidious
to
say
people
who
are
not
catholics
who
repudiate
catholicism
as
a
deadly
and
jews
asked
marietta
no
not
exactly
they
are
generally
classified
as
christians
but
they
protest
you
know
protesto
protestare
verb
active
first
conjugation
pare
che
la
donna
protesta
troppo
as
the
poet
sings
they
christians
but
they
protest
against
the
pope
and
the
the
signorino
means
freemasons
said
marietta
no
he
does
said
peter
he
means
but
pardon
signorino
she
insisted
if
they
are
not
catholics
they
must
be
freemasons
or
jews
they
can
not
be
christians
christian
catholic
it
is
the
same
all
christians
are
tu
quoque
he
cried
you
regard
the
terms
as
interchangeable
i
heard
the
identical
sentiment
similarly
enunciated
by
another
do
i
look
like
a
freemason
she
bent
her
sharp
old
eyes
upon
him
studiously
for
a
moment
then
she
shook
her
head
no
she
answered
slowly
i
do
not
think
that
the
signorino
looks
like
a
a
jew
then
mache
a
jew
the
signorino
she
shrugged
derision
and
yet
i
what
they
call
a
protestant
he
said
no
said
she
yes
said
he
i
refer
you
to
my
sponsors
in
baptism
a
regular
true
blue
moderate
high
churchman
and
tory
british
and
protestant
to
the
backbone
with
their
popish
tricks
writ
large
all
over
me
you
have
never
by
any
chance
married
a
protestant
yourself
he
asked
no
signorino
i
have
never
married
any
one
but
it
was
not
for
the
lack
of
occasions
twenty
thirty
young
men
courted
me
when
i
was
a
girl
but
mica
i
would
not
look
at
them
when
men
are
young
they
are
too
unsteady
for
husbands
when
they
are
old
they
have
the
admirably
philosophised
he
approved
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
men
are
neither
young
nor
old
there
are
men
of
i
have
even
heard
that
there
are
men
of
forty
what
of
them
there
is
a
proverb
signorino
which
says
sposi
di
quarant
anni
son
mai
sempre
tiranni
she
informed
him
for
the
matter
of
that
he
retorted
there
is
a
proverb
which
says
love
laughs
at
non
capisco
said
marietta
that
merely
because
it
english
said
he
you
understand
fast
enough
if
i
should
put
it
in
italian
but
i
only
quoted
it
to
show
the
futility
of
proverbs
laugh
at
locksmiths
indeed
why
it
ca
even
laugh
at
such
an
insignificant
detail
as
a
papist
prejudices
but
i
wish
i
were
a
duke
and
a
millionaire
do
you
know
any
one
who
could
create
me
a
duke
and
endow
me
with
a
million
no
signorino
she
answered
shaking
her
head
fragrant
cytherea
venus
deathless
aphrodite
can
not
goddess
though
she
is
he
complained
the
fact
is
i
feeling
rather
undone
i
think
i
will
ask
you
to
bring
me
a
bottle
of
some
of
the
dry
kind
with
the
white
seal
i
try
to
pretend
that
it
champagne
to
tell
or
not
to
tell
that
is
the
question
face
to
lose
youth
for
to
occupy
age
with
the
dream
of
meet
death
with
and
yet
if
you
can
believe
me
the
man
who
penned
those
lines
had
never
seen
her
he
penned
another
line
equally
pat
to
the
situation
though
he
had
never
seen
me
either
there
no
method
to
tell
her
in
spanish
but
you
ca
imagine
how
i
detest
that
vulgar
use
of
for
as
if
literature
were
a
kind
of
pig
however
it
perhaps
no
worse
than
the
use
of
asti
for
champagne
one
should
be
too
fastidious
i
must
really
try
to
think
of
some
method
of
telling
her
in
marietta
went
to
fetch
the
asti
xxiii
when
peter
rose
next
morning
he
pulled
a
grimace
at
the
departed
night
you
are
a
detected
cheat
he
cried
an
unmasked
impostor
you
live
upon
your
reputation
as
a
counsellor
is
the
only
reason
why
we
bear
with
you
la
nuit
porte
conseil
yet
what
counsel
have
you
brought
to
me
and
i
at
the
pass
where
my
need
is
uttermost
shall
i
go
to
her
this
afternoon
and
unburden
my
soul
or
shall
i
not
you
have
left
me
where
you
found
me
in
the
same
fine
free
and
liberal
state
of
vacillation
discredited
oracle
he
was
standing
before
his
brushing
his
hair
the
image
in
the
glass
frowned
back
at
him
then
something
struck
him
at
all
events
we
go
this
morning
to
spiaggia
and
have
our
hair
cut
he
resolved
so
he
walked
to
the
village
and
caught
the
ten
omnibus
for
spiaggia
and
after
he
had
had
his
hair
cut
he
went
to
the
hotel
de
russie
and
lunched
in
the
garden
and
after
luncheon
of
course
he
entered
the
grounds
of
the
casino
and
strolled
backwards
and
forwards
one
of
a
merry
procession
on
the
terrace
by
the
lakeside
the
gay
toilets
of
the
women
their
hats
and
sunshades
made
the
terrace
look
like
a
great
bank
of
monstrous
moving
flowers
the
band
played
brisk
accompaniments
to
the
steady
babble
of
voices
italian
english
german
the
pure
air
was
shot
with
alien
scents
the
perfumery
the
men
the
marvellous
blue
waters
crisped
in
the
breeze
and
sparkled
in
the
sun
and
the
smooth
snows
of
monte
sfiorito
loomed
so
near
one
felt
one
could
almost
put
out
one
stick
and
scratch
one
name
upon
them
and
here
as
luck
would
have
it
peter
came
face
to
face
with
florence
how
do
you
do
said
she
offering
her
hand
how
do
you
do
said
he
it
a
fine
day
said
she
very
said
he
shall
i
make
you
a
confidence
she
asked
do
he
answered
are
you
sure
i
can
trust
you
she
scanned
his
face
dubiously
try
it
and
see
he
urged
well
then
if
you
must
know
i
was
thirsting
to
take
a
table
and
call
for
coffee
but
having
no
man
at
hand
to
chaperon
me
i
dared
je
vous
en
prie
cried
peter
with
a
gesture
of
gallantry
and
he
led
her
to
one
of
the
round
marble
tables
due
caffe
he
said
to
the
brilliant
creature
chains
buckles
of
silver
filigree
and
and
apron
of
silk
who
came
to
learn
their
pleasure
softly
softly
put
in
florence
not
a
drop
of
coffee
for
me
an
if
you
please
coffee
was
a
figure
of
speech
a
generic
term
for
light
peter
laughed
and
amended
his
order
do
you
see
those
three
innocent
darlings
playing
together
under
the
eye
of
their
governess
by
the
wellingtonia
yonder
enquired
the
lady
the
little
girl
in
white
and
the
two
boys
asked
peter
precisely
said
she
such
as
they
are
they
me
really
he
responded
in
the
tone
of
profound
and
sympathetic
interest
we
are
apt
to
affect
when
parents
begin
about
their
children
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
she
assured
him
but
i
mention
the
fact
not
in
a
spirit
of
boastfulness
but
merely
to
show
you
that
i
not
entirely
alone
and
unprotected
there
an
american
at
our
hotel
by
the
bye
who
goes
up
and
down
telling
every
one
who
listen
that
it
ought
to
be
washingtonia
and
declaiming
with
tears
in
his
eyes
against
the
arrogance
of
the
english
in
changing
washington
to
wellington
as
a
man
with
daughters
i
should
think
very
likely
he
very
likely
said
peter
it
an
american
tree
is
it
whether
it
is
or
whether
it
is
said
she
one
thing
is
undeniable
you
english
are
the
animals
south
of
the
arctic
oh
are
we
he
doubted
you
are
that
she
affirmed
with
sorrowing
emphasis
ah
well
he
reflected
the
temperature
of
our
blood
does
matter
we
at
any
rate
notoriously
are
you
indeed
she
exclaimed
if
you
are
it
a
mighty
quiet
kind
of
notoriety
let
me
tell
you
and
a
mighty
cold
kind
of
peter
laughed
you
all
for
prudence
and
expediency
you
the
slaves
of
your
reason
you
dominated
by
the
head
not
by
the
heart
you
little
better
than
are
you
ever
known
now
for
instance
to
risk
earth
and
heaven
and
all
things
between
them
on
a
sudden
unthinking
impulse
not
often
i
daresay
he
admitted
and
you
sit
there
as
serene
as
a
brazen
statue
and
own
it
without
a
quaver
she
reproached
him
surely
he
urged
in
my
character
of
englishman
it
behooves
me
to
appear
smug
and
you
right
she
agreed
i
wonder
she
continued
after
a
pause
during
which
her
eyes
looked
thoughtful
i
wonder
whether
you
would
fall
upon
and
annihilate
a
person
who
should
venture
to
offer
you
a
word
of
i
should
sit
as
serene
as
a
brazen
statue
and
receive
it
without
a
quaver
he
promised
well
then
said
she
leaning
forward
a
little
and
dropping
her
voice
why
do
you
take
your
courage
in
both
hands
and
ask
her
peter
stared
be
guided
by
me
and
do
it
she
said
do
what
he
puzzled
ask
her
to
marry
you
of
course
she
returned
amiably
then
without
allowing
him
time
to
shape
an
answer
touche
she
cried
in
triumph
i
brought
the
colour
to
your
cheek
and
you
a
brazen
statue
do
not
love
who
do
not
show
their
love
but
in
faith
you
show
yours
to
any
one
who
be
at
pains
to
watch
you
your
eyes
betray
you
as
often
as
ever
you
look
at
her
i
had
observed
you
for
two
minutes
by
the
clock
when
i
knew
your
secret
as
well
as
if
you
chosen
me
for
your
confessor
but
what
holding
you
back
you
ca
expect
her
to
do
the
proposing
now
curse
me
for
a
meddlesome
irishwoman
if
you
will
but
why
do
you
throw
yourself
at
her
feet
and
ask
her
like
a
man
how
can
i
said
peter
abandoning
any
desire
he
may
have
felt
to
beat
about
the
bush
nay
indeed
it
is
very
possible
he
welcomed
rather
than
resented
the
irishwoman
meddling
what
to
prevent
you
said
she
everything
said
he
everything
is
nothing
that
dear
lady
she
is
hideously
rich
for
one
getaway
with
you
was
the
dear
lady
warm
expostulation
what
has
money
to
do
with
the
question
if
a
man
in
love
but
that
the
english
of
it
there
you
are
with
your
calculation
you
chain
up
your
natural
impulses
as
if
they
were
dangerous
beasts
her
money
never
saved
you
from
succumbing
to
her
enchantments
why
should
it
bar
you
from
declaring
your
there
a
sort
of
tendency
in
society
said
peter
to
look
upon
the
poor
man
who
seeks
the
hand
of
a
rich
woman
as
a
a
fig
for
the
opinion
of
society
she
cried
the
only
opinion
you
should
consider
is
the
opinion
of
the
woman
you
adore
i
was
an
heiress
myself
and
when
teddy
proposed
to
me
upon
my
conscience
i
believe
the
sole
piece
of
property
he
possessed
in
the
world
was
a
corkscrew
so
much
for
her
ducats
peter
laughed
men
after
coffee
are
frequently
in
the
habit
of
smoking
said
she
you
have
my
sanction
for
a
cigarette
it
will
keep
you
in
thank
you
said
peter
and
lit
his
cigarette
and
surely
it
a
countenance
you
need
to
be
going
on
like
that
about
her
money
however
if
you
can
find
a
ray
of
comfort
in
the
information
small
good
will
her
future
husband
get
of
it
even
if
he
is
a
fortunehunter
for
she
gives
the
bulk
of
it
away
in
charity
and
i
doubtful
if
she
keeps
two
thousand
a
year
for
her
own
really
said
peter
and
for
a
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
a
ray
of
comfort
in
the
information
yes
you
may
rate
her
at
two
thousand
a
year
said
florence
i
suppose
you
can
match
that
yourself
so
the
disparity
the
ray
of
comfort
had
flickered
for
a
second
and
gone
out
there
are
unfortunately
other
disparities
he
remarked
gloomily
put
a
name
on
them
said
she
there
her
his
impetuous
adviser
flung
up
a
hand
of
scorn
her
rank
do
you
say
she
cried
to
the
mischief
with
her
rank
what
rank
to
love
a
woman
is
only
a
woman
whether
she
calls
herself
a
duchess
or
a
a
woman
with
any
spirit
would
marry
a
bank
manager
if
she
loved
him
a
man
a
man
you
should
care
that
for
her
that
was
a
snap
of
o
donovan
florence
fingers
i
suppose
you
know
said
peter
that
i
am
a
are
you
you
poor
benighted
creature
well
that
easily
remedied
go
and
get
yourself
baptised
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
town
as
if
to
recommend
his
immediate
procedure
in
quest
of
a
baptistery
peter
laughed
again
i
afraid
that
more
easily
said
than
easy
she
exclaimed
why
you
only
to
stand
still
and
let
yourself
be
sprinkled
it
the
priest
who
does
the
work
do
tell
me
she
added
with
persuasive
inconsequence
that
you
allow
a
little
thing
like
being
in
love
with
a
woman
to
keep
you
back
from
professing
the
true
ah
if
i
were
convinced
that
it
is
true
he
sighed
still
laughing
what
call
have
you
to
doubt
it
and
anyhow
what
does
it
matter
whether
you
convinced
or
not
i
remember
when
i
was
a
i
never
was
myself
convinced
of
the
theorems
of
euclid
but
i
professed
them
gladly
for
the
sake
of
the
marks
they
brought
and
the
eternal
verities
of
mathematics
remained
unshaken
by
my
your
reasoning
is
subtle
laughed
peter
but
the
worst
of
it
is
if
i
were
ten
times
a
catholic
she
would
have
me
so
what
the
use
you
never
can
tell
whether
a
woman
will
have
you
or
not
until
you
offer
yourself
and
even
if
she
refuses
you
is
that
a
ground
for
despair
my
own
husband
asked
me
three
times
and
three
times
i
said
no
and
then
he
took
to
writing
verses
and
i
saw
there
was
but
one
way
to
stop
him
so
we
were
married
ask
her
ask
her
again
and
again
you
can
always
resort
in
the
end
to
versification
and
now
the
lady
concluded
rising
i
have
spoken
and
i
leave
you
to
your
fate
i
obliged
to
return
to
the
hotel
to
hold
a
bed
of
justice
it
appears
that
my
innocent
darlings
beyond
there
innocent
as
they
look
have
managed
among
them
to
break
the
electric
light
in
my
they
to
be
arraigned
before
me
at
three
for
an
instruction
criminelle
put
what
i
said
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
is
a
mother
last
request
if
i
not
succeeded
in
determining
you
do
pretend
at
least
that
i
have
encouraged
you
a
bit
put
what
i
said
in
your
pipe
and
see
whether
by
vigorous
drawing
you
ca
fan
the
smouldering
fires
of
encouragement
into
a
small
blaze
of
peter
resumed
his
stroll
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
lakeside
encouragement
was
all
very
well
but
shall
i
shall
i
not
shall
i
shall
i
not
shall
i
shall
i
not
the
eternal
question
went
to
the
rhythm
of
his
march
he
glared
at
vacancy
and
tried
hard
to
make
up
his
mind
i
afraid
i
must
be
somewhat
lacking
in
decision
of
character
he
said
with
pathetic
wonder
then
suddenly
he
stamped
his
foot
come
an
end
to
this
tergiversation
do
it
do
it
cried
his
manlier
soul
i
will
he
resolved
all
at
once
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
clenching
his
fists
he
left
the
casino
and
set
forth
to
walk
to
ventirose
he
could
not
wait
for
the
omnibus
which
would
not
leave
till
four
he
must
strike
while
his
will
was
hot
he
walked
rapidly
in
less
than
an
hour
he
had
reached
the
tall
gilded
grille
of
the
park
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
looked
up
the
straight
avenue
of
chestnuts
to
the
western
front
of
the
castle
softly
alight
in
the
afternoon
sun
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
pendent
of
twisted
iron
to
summon
the
porter
in
another
second
he
would
have
rung
he
would
have
been
admitted
and
just
then
one
of
the
little
demons
that
inhabit
the
circumambient
air
called
his
attention
to
an
aspect
of
the
situation
which
he
had
not
thought
of
wait
a
bit
it
whispered
in
his
ear
you
were
there
only
yesterday
it
ca
fail
therefore
to
seem
extraordinary
your
calling
again
you
must
be
prepared
with
an
excuse
an
explanation
but
suppose
when
you
arrive
suppose
that
like
the
lady
in
the
ballad
she
greets
you
with
glance
of
cold
surprise
what
then
my
dear
why
then
it
obvious
you
ca
allege
the
true
explanation
can
you
if
she
greets
you
with
a
glance
of
cold
surprise
you
have
your
answer
as
it
were
before
the
fact
you
know
that
there
no
manner
of
hope
for
you
and
the
time
for
passionate
avowals
will
automatically
defer
itself
but
then
how
will
you
justify
your
visit
what
face
can
you
put
on
h
assented
peter
there
something
in
there
a
great
deal
in
that
said
the
demon
you
must
have
an
excuse
up
your
sleeve
a
pretext
a
true
excuse
is
a
fine
thing
in
its
way
but
when
you
come
to
a
serious
emergency
an
alternative
false
excuse
is
h
said
peter
however
if
there
are
demons
in
the
atmosphere
there
are
gods
in
the
machine
paraschkine
even
goes
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
there
are
more
gods
in
the
machine
than
have
ever
been
taken
from
while
peter
stood
still
pondering
the
demon
really
rather
cogent
intervention
his
eye
was
caught
by
something
that
glittered
in
the
grass
at
the
roadside
the
cardinal
he
exclaimed
picking
it
up
the
cardinal
had
dropped
his
here
was
an
excuse
and
to
spare
peter
rang
the
bell
xxiv
and
like
the
lady
in
the
ballad
sure
enough
she
greeted
his
arrival
with
a
glance
of
cold
surprise
at
all
events
eyebrows
raised
face
unsmiling
it
was
a
glance
that
clearly
supplemented
her
spoken
how
do
you
do
by
a
tacit
perhaps
what
can
bring
him
here
you
or
i
indeed
or
florence
in
the
fulness
of
our
knowledge
might
very
likely
have
interpreted
it
rather
as
a
glance
of
nervous
apprehension
anyhow
it
was
a
glance
that
perfectly
checked
the
impetus
of
his
intent
something
snapped
and
gave
way
within
him
and
he
needed
no
further
signal
that
the
occasion
for
passionate
avowals
was
not
the
present
and
thereupon
befell
a
scene
that
was
really
quite
too
absurd
that
was
really
childish
a
scene
over
the
memory
of
which
i
must
believe
they
themselves
have
sometimes
laughed
together
though
at
the
moment
its
absurdity
held
for
him
at
least
elements
of
the
tragic
he
met
her
in
the
broad
gravelled
before
the
great
she
had
on
her
hat
and
gloves
as
if
she
were
just
going
out
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
a
little
pale
her
eyes
seemed
darker
than
usual
and
graver
certainly
cold
surprise
or
nervous
apprehension
as
you
will
her
attitude
was
by
no
means
cordial
it
was
not
oncoming
it
showed
none
of
her
accustomed
easy
wholly
friendliness
it
was
decidedly
the
attitude
of
a
person
standing
off
shut
in
withheld
i
have
never
seen
her
in
the
least
like
this
before
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
pale
face
her
dark
grave
eyes
i
have
never
seen
her
more
beautiful
and
there
is
not
one
single
atom
of
hope
for
how
do
you
do
she
said
unsmiling
and
waited
as
who
should
invite
him
to
state
his
errand
she
did
not
offer
him
her
hand
but
for
that
matter
she
might
have
pleaded
she
could
not
very
well
for
one
of
her
hands
held
her
sunshade
and
the
other
held
an
embroidered
silk
bag
woman
makeshift
for
a
pocket
and
then
capping
the
first
pang
of
his
disappointment
a
kind
of
anger
seized
him
after
all
what
right
had
she
to
receive
him
in
this
fashion
as
if
he
were
an
intrusive
stranger
in
common
civility
in
common
justice
she
owed
it
to
him
to
suppose
that
he
would
not
be
there
without
abundant
reason
and
now
with
peter
angry
the
absurd
little
scene
began
assuming
an
attitude
designed
to
be
in
its
own
way
as
reticent
as
hers
i
was
passing
your
gate
he
explained
when
i
happened
to
find
this
lying
by
the
roadside
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
it
to
he
gave
her
the
cardinal
snuff
box
which
in
spite
of
her
preoccupation
she
was
able
to
accept
a
liberty
he
thought
grinding
his
teeth
yes
no
doubt
she
would
have
wished
me
to
leave
it
with
the
porter
at
the
lodge
no
doubt
she
deems
it
an
act
of
officiousness
on
my
part
to
have
found
it
at
and
his
anger
mounted
how
very
good
of
you
she
said
my
uncle
could
not
think
where
he
had
mislaid
i
am
very
fortunate
to
be
the
means
of
restoring
it
said
he
then
after
a
second
suspension
as
she
said
nothing
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
snuffbox
examining
it
as
if
it
were
quite
new
to
her
he
lifted
his
hat
and
bowed
preparatory
to
retiring
down
the
avenue
oh
but
my
uncle
will
wish
to
thank
you
she
exclaimed
looking
up
with
a
kind
of
start
will
you
not
come
in
i
i
will
see
whether
he
is
she
made
a
tentative
movement
towards
the
door
she
had
thawed
perceptibly
but
even
as
she
thawed
peter
in
his
anger
froze
and
stiffened
i
will
see
whether
he
is
the
expression
grated
and
perhaps
in
effect
it
was
not
a
particularly
felicitous
expression
but
if
the
poor
woman
was
suffering
from
nervous
apprehension
i
beg
you
on
no
account
to
disturb
cardinal
udeschini
he
returned
loftily
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
slightest
and
even
as
he
stiffened
she
unbent
but
it
is
a
matter
of
consequence
to
him
to
us
she
said
faintly
smiling
we
have
hunted
high
and
low
for
it
we
feared
it
was
lost
for
good
it
must
have
fallen
from
his
pocket
when
he
was
walking
he
will
wish
to
thank
i
am
more
than
thanked
already
said
peter
alas
as
monsieur
de
la
pallisse
has
sagely
noted
when
we
aim
to
appear
dignified
how
often
do
we
just
succeed
in
appearing
churlish
and
to
put
a
seal
upon
this
ridiculous
encounter
to
make
it
irrevocable
he
lifted
his
hat
again
and
turned
away
oh
very
well
murmured
the
duchessa
in
a
voice
that
did
not
reach
him
if
it
had
reached
him
perhaps
he
would
have
come
back
perhaps
things
might
have
happened
i
think
there
was
regret
in
her
voice
as
well
as
despite
she
stood
for
a
minute
as
he
tramped
down
the
avenue
and
looked
after
him
with
those
unusually
dark
grave
eyes
at
last
making
a
little
gesture
as
of
regret
despite
impatience
she
went
into
the
house
here
is
your
she
said
to
the
cardinal
the
old
man
put
down
his
breviary
he
was
seated
by
an
open
window
getting
through
his
office
and
smiled
at
the
snuff
box
fondly
caressing
it
with
his
finger
afterwards
he
shook
it
opened
it
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
where
did
you
find
it
he
enquired
it
was
found
by
that
marchdale
she
said
in
the
road
outside
the
gate
you
must
have
let
it
drop
this
morning
when
you
were
walking
with
that
marchdale
exclaimed
the
cardinal
what
a
a
coincidence
questioned
beatrice
to
be
sure
said
he
was
it
not
to
marchdale
that
i
owed
it
in
the
first
instance
oh
was
it
i
had
fancied
that
you
owed
it
to
yes
but
he
reminded
her
whilst
the
lines
deepened
about
his
humorous
old
mouth
but
as
a
reward
of
my
virtue
in
conspiring
with
you
to
convert
him
and
by
the
way
how
is
his
conversion
progressing
the
cardinal
looked
up
with
interest
it
is
not
progressing
at
all
i
think
there
is
no
chance
of
it
answered
beatrice
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
imply
a
certain
irritation
oh
said
the
cardinal
no
said
she
i
thought
he
had
shown
said
the
cardinal
that
was
a
mistake
he
has
shown
none
he
is
a
very
tiresome
and
silly
person
he
is
not
worth
converting
she
declared
succinctly
good
gracious
said
the
cardinal
he
resumed
his
office
but
every
now
and
again
he
would
pause
and
look
out
of
the
window
with
the
frown
of
a
man
meditating
something
then
he
would
shake
his
head
significantly
and
take
snuff
peter
tramped
down
the
avenue
angry
and
sick
her
reception
of
him
had
not
only
administered
an
instant
to
his
hopes
as
a
lover
but
in
its
ungenial
aloofness
it
had
cruelly
wounded
his
pride
as
a
man
he
felt
snubbed
and
humiliated
oh
true
enough
she
had
unbent
a
little
towards
the
end
but
it
was
the
look
with
which
she
had
first
greeted
him
it
was
the
air
with
which
she
had
waited
for
him
to
state
his
errand
that
stung
and
rankled
and
would
not
be
forgotten
he
was
angry
with
her
angry
with
circumstances
with
life
angry
with
himself
i
am
a
fool
and
a
double
fool
and
a
triple
fool
he
said
i
am
a
fool
ever
to
have
thought
of
her
at
all
a
double
fool
ever
to
have
allowed
myself
to
think
so
much
of
her
a
triple
and
quadruple
and
quintuple
idiot
ever
to
have
imagined
for
a
moment
that
anything
could
come
of
it
i
have
wasted
time
enough
the
next
best
thing
to
winning
is
to
know
when
you
are
beaten
i
acknowledge
myself
beaten
i
will
go
back
to
england
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
boxes
he
gazed
darkly
round
the
familiar
valley
with
eyes
that
abjured
it
olympus
no
doubt
laughed
xxv
i
shall
go
back
to
england
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
boxes
but
he
took
no
immediate
steps
to
get
them
packed
hope
observes
the
french
publicist
quoted
in
the
preceding
chapter
hope
dies
hope
peter
fancied
had
received
its
that
afternoon
already
that
evening
it
began
to
revive
a
little
it
was
very
much
enfeebled
it
was
very
indefinite
and
diffident
but
it
was
not
dead
it
amounted
perhaps
to
nothing
more
than
a
vague
kind
of
feeling
that
he
would
not
on
the
whole
make
his
departure
for
england
quite
so
precipitate
as
in
the
first
heat
of
his
anger
the
first
chill
of
his
despair
he
had
intended
piano
piano
he
would
move
slowly
he
would
do
nothing
rash
but
he
was
not
happy
he
was
very
far
from
happy
he
spent
a
wretched
night
a
wretched
restless
morrow
he
walked
about
a
great
deal
about
his
garden
and
afterwards
when
the
damnable
iteration
of
his
garden
had
become
unbearable
he
walked
to
the
village
and
took
the
riverside
path
under
the
poplars
along
the
racing
aco
and
followed
it
as
the
waters
paled
and
broadened
for
i
forget
how
many
joyless
unremunerative
miles
when
he
came
home
fagged
out
and
dusty
at
dinner
time
marietta
presented
a
visiting
card
to
him
on
her
handsomest
salver
she
presented
it
with
a
flourish
that
was
almost
a
swagger
twice
the
size
of
an
ordinary
the
fashion
of
it
was
roughly
thus
il
cardle
udeschini
sacr
congr
archiv
et
inscript
praef
palazzo
udeschini
and
above
the
legend
was
pencilled
in
a
small
oldfashioned
hand
wonderfully
neat
and
pretty
to
thank
marchdale
for
his
courtesy
in
returning
my
the
lord
prince
cardinal
udeschini
was
here
said
marietta
there
was
a
swagger
in
her
accent
there
was
also
something
in
her
accent
that
seemed
to
rebuke
peter
for
his
absence
i
had
inferred
as
much
from
this
said
he
tapping
the
card
we
english
you
know
are
great
at
putting
two
and
two
he
came
in
a
carriage
said
marietta
not
really
said
her
master
ang
veramente
she
affirmed
was
was
he
alone
peter
asked
an
obscure
little
twinge
of
hope
stirring
in
his
heart
no
and
then
she
generalised
with
untranslatable
magniloquence
un
amplissimo
porporato
non
va
mai
peter
ought
to
have
hugged
her
for
that
amplissimo
porporato
but
he
was
selfishly
engrossed
in
his
emotions
who
was
with
him
he
tried
to
throw
the
question
out
with
a
casual
effect
an
effect
of
unconcern
the
signorina
emelia
manfredi
was
with
him
answered
marietta
little
recking
how
mere
words
can
stab
oh
said
peter
the
lord
prince
cardinal
udeschini
was
very
sorry
not
to
see
the
signorino
continued
marietta
poor
man
was
he
let
us
trust
that
time
will
console
him
said
peter
callously
but
i
wonder
he
asked
himself
i
wonder
whether
perhaps
i
was
the
least
bit
hasty
yesterday
if
i
had
stopped
i
should
have
saved
the
cardinal
a
journey
here
i
might
have
known
that
he
would
come
these
italians
are
so
punctilious
and
then
if
i
had
stopped
if
i
had
stopped
possibly
possibly
possibly
what
oh
nothing
and
yet
if
he
had
stopped
well
at
any
rate
he
would
have
gained
time
the
duchessa
had
already
begun
to
thaw
if
he
had
stopped
he
could
formulate
no
precise
conclusion
to
that
if
but
he
felt
dimly
remorseful
that
he
had
not
stopped
he
felt
that
he
had
indeed
been
the
least
bit
hasty
and
his
remorse
was
somehow
medicine
to
his
reviving
hope
after
all
i
scarcely
gave
things
a
fair
trial
yesterday
he
said
and
the
corollary
of
that
of
course
was
that
he
might
give
things
a
further
and
fairer
trial
some
other
day
but
his
hope
was
still
hard
hurt
he
was
still
in
a
profound
dejection
the
signorino
is
not
eating
his
dinner
cried
marietta
fixing
him
with
suspicious
upbraiding
eyes
i
never
said
i
was
he
retorted
the
signorino
is
not
well
she
questioned
anxious
oh
yes
cosi
cosi
the
signorino
is
well
enough
he
answered
the
dinner
you
could
perceive
that
she
brought
herself
with
difficulty
to
frame
the
dread
hypothesis
the
dinner
is
not
good
her
voice
sank
she
waited
tense
for
his
reply
the
dinner
said
he
if
one
may
criticise
without
eating
it
the
dinner
is
excellent
i
will
have
no
aspersions
cast
upon
my
breathed
marietta
a
tremulous
sigh
of
relief
it
is
not
the
signorino
it
is
not
the
dinner
it
is
the
world
that
is
awry
peter
went
on
in
reflective
melancholy
is
the
times
that
are
out
of
joint
is
the
sex
the
sex
that
is
not
well
that
is
not
good
that
needs
a
thorough
overhauling
and
which
sex
asked
marietta
the
sex
said
peter
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
rhetoricians
there
is
but
one
sex
the
sex
the
fair
sex
the
unfair
sex
the
gentle
sex
the
barbaric
sex
we
men
do
not
form
a
sex
we
do
not
even
form
a
sect
we
are
your
mere
satellites
your
things
your
playthings
we
are
the
mere
shuttlecocks
which
you
toss
hither
and
thither
with
your
battledores
as
the
wanton
mood
impels
you
we
are
born
of
woman
we
are
swaddled
and
nursed
by
woman
we
are
governessed
by
woman
subsequently
we
are
beguiled
by
woman
fooled
by
woman
led
on
put
off
tantalised
by
woman
fretted
and
bullied
by
her
finally
last
scene
of
all
we
are
wrapped
in
our
cerements
by
woman
life
birth
death
turn
upon
woman
as
upon
a
hinge
i
have
ever
been
a
misanthrope
but
now
i
am
seriously
thinking
of
becoming
a
misogynist
as
well
would
you
advise
me
so
a
misogynist
what
is
that
signorino
asked
marietta
a
he
explained
one
who
abhors
and
forswears
the
sex
one
who
has
dashed
his
spectacles
from
his
eyes
and
sees
woman
as
she
really
is
with
no
illusive
glamour
one
who
has
found
her
out
yes
i
think
i
shall
become
a
misogynist
it
is
the
only
way
of
rendering
yourself
invulnerable
is
the
only
safe
course
during
my
walk
this
afternoon
i
recollected
from
the
scattered
of
memory
and
arranged
in
consequent
order
at
least
a
score
of
good
old
apothegmatic
shafts
against
the
sex
was
it
not
for
example
in
the
grey
beginning
of
days
was
it
not
woman
whose
mortal
taste
brought
sin
into
the
world
and
all
our
woe
was
not
that
pandora
a
woman
who
liberated
from
the
box
wherein
they
were
confined
the
swarm
of
winged
evils
that
still
afflict
us
i
will
not
remind
you
of
john
chrysostom
golden
parable
about
a
temple
and
the
thing
it
is
constructed
over
but
i
will
come
straight
to
the
point
and
ask
whether
this
is
truth
the
poet
sings
when
he
informs
us
roundly
that
woman
is
a
scold
at
heart
marietta
was
gazing
patiently
at
the
sky
she
did
not
answer
the
tongue
peter
resumed
is
woman
weapon
even
as
the
fist
is
man
and
it
is
a
far
deadlier
weapon
words
break
no
bones
they
break
hearts
instead
yet
were
men
part
so
ready
with
their
fists
as
women
are
with
their
barbed
and
envenomed
tongues
what
savage
brutes
you
would
think
us
would
you
and
what
a
rushing
trade
the
would
drive
to
be
sure
that
is
one
of
the
good
old
cliches
that
came
back
to
me
during
my
walk
all
women
are
alike
there
no
choice
amongst
animated
that
is
another
a
woman
is
the
creature
of
her
temper
her
husband
her
children
and
her
servants
are
its
victims
that
is
a
third
woman
is
a
bundle
of
pins
man
is
her
when
woman
loves
is
not
the
man
she
loves
but
the
man
flattery
woman
love
is
reflex
the
man
who
marries
puts
himself
in
irons
marriage
is
a
in
a
garden
the
birds
without
hanker
to
get
in
but
the
birds
within
know
that
there
is
no
condition
so
enviable
as
that
of
the
birds
without
well
speak
up
what
do
you
think
do
you
advise
me
to
become
a
misogynist
i
do
not
understand
signorino
said
marietta
of
course
you
do
said
peter
who
ever
could
understand
such
stuff
and
nonsense
that
the
worst
of
it
if
only
one
could
understand
if
only
one
could
believe
it
one
might
find
peace
one
might
resign
oneself
but
alas
and
alas
i
have
never
had
any
real
faith
in
human
wickedness
and
now
try
as
i
will
i
can
not
imbue
my
mind
with
any
real
faith
in
the
undesirability
of
woman
that
is
why
you
see
me
dissolved
in
tears
and
unable
to
eat
my
dinner
oh
to
think
to
think
he
cried
with
passion
suddenly
breaking
into
english
to
think
that
less
than
a
fortnight
ago
less
than
one
little
brief
fortnight
ago
she
was
seated
in
your
kitchen
seated
there
familiarly
in
her
wet
clothes
pouring
tea
for
all
the
world
as
if
she
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
days
passed
he
could
not
go
to
ventirose
or
anyhow
he
thought
he
could
not
he
reverted
to
his
old
habit
of
living
in
his
garden
haunting
the
riverside
keeping
watchful
covetous
eyes
turned
towards
the
castle
the
river
bubbled
and
babbled
the
sun
shone
strong
and
clear
his
fountain
tinkled
his
birds
flew
about
their
affairs
his
flowers
breathed
forth
their
perfumes
the
gnisi
frowned
the
uplands
westward
laughed
the
snows
of
monte
sfiorito
sailed
under
every
colour
of
the
calendar
except
their
native
white
all
was
as
it
had
ever
been
but
oh
the
difference
to
him
a
week
passed
he
caught
no
glimpse
of
the
duchessa
yet
he
took
no
steps
to
get
his
boxes
packed
xxvi
and
then
marietta
fell
one
morning
when
she
came
into
his
room
to
bring
his
tea
and
to
open
the
venetian
blinds
that
shaded
his
windows
she
failed
to
salute
him
with
her
customary
brisk
buon
giorno
noticing
which
and
wondering
he
from
his
pillow
called
out
giorno
buon

signorino
she
returned
but
in
a
whisper
what
the
matter
is
there
cause
for
secrecy
peter
asked

a
cold
signorino
she
whispered
pointing
to
her
chest
i
can
not
the
venetian
blinds
were
up
by
this
time
the
room
was
full
of
sun
he
looked
at
her
something
in
her
face
alarmed
him
it
seemed
drawn
and
set
it
seemed
flushed
come
here
he
said
with
a
certain
peremptoriness
give
me
your
she
wiped
her
brown
old
hand
backwards
and
forwards
across
her
apron
then
gave
it
to
him
it
was
hot
and
dry
your
cold
is
feverish
he
said
you
must
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
till
the
fever

i
can
not
go
to
bed
signorino
she
replied
ca

have
you
tried
asked
he

signorino
she
admitted
well
you
never
can
tell
whether
you
can
do
a
thing
or
not
until
you
try
said
he
try
to
go
to
bed
and
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
i
can
not
go
to
bed
who
would
do
the
signorino
work
was
her
whispered
objection
hang
the
signorino
work
the
signorino
work
will
do
itself
have
you
never
observed
that
if
you
conscientiously
neglect
to
do
your
work
it
somehow
manages
to
get
done
without
you
you
have
a
feverish
cold
you
must
keep
out
of
draughts
and
the
only
place
where
you
can
be
sure
of
keeping
out
of
draughts
is
bed
go
to
bed
at
she
left
the
room
but
when
peter
came
downstairs
half
an
hour
later
he
heard
her
moving
in
her
kitchen
marietta
he
cried
entering
that
apartment
with
the
mien
of
nemesis
i
thought
i
told
you
to
go
to
marietta
cowered
a
little
and
looked
sheepish
as
one
surprised
in
the
flagrant
fact
of
misdemeanour
yes
signorino
she
whispered
well
do
you
call
this
bed
he
demanded
no
signorino
she
acknowledged
do
you
wish
to
oblige
me
to
put
you
to
bed
he
asked
oh
no
signorino
she
protested
horror
in
her
whisper
then
go
to
bed
directly
if
you
delay
any
longer
i
shall
accuse
you
of
wilful
bene
signorino
reluctantly
consented
marietta
peter
strolled
into
his
garden
gigi
the
gardener
was
working
there
the
very
man
i
most
desired
to
meet
said
peter
and
beckoned
to
him
is
there
a
doctor
in
the
village
he
enquired
when
gigi
had
approached
yes
signorino
the
syndic
is
a
doctor
good
said
peter
will
you
go
to
the
village
please
and
ask
carretaji
if
he
can
make
it
convenient
to
call
here
marietta
is
not
yes
and
stop
a
bit
said
peter
are
there
such
things
as
women
in
the
village
ah
mache
signorino
but
many
many
answered
gigi
rolling
his
dark
eyes
sympathetically
and
waving
his
hands
i
need
but
one
said
peter
a
woman
to
come
and
do
marietta
work
for
a
day
or
two
cook
and
clean
up
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
think
you
could
procure
me
such
a
woman
there
is
my
wife
signorino
suggested
gigi
if
she
would
content
the
signorino
oh
i
was
aware
that
you
were
married
a
hundred
felicitations
yes
your
wife
by
all
means
ask
her
to
come
and
rule
as
gigi
started
for
the
village
peter
went
into
the
house
and
knocked
at
marietta
door
he
found
her
in
bed
with
her
rosary
in
her
hands
if
she
could
not
work
she
would
not
waste
her
time
in
marietta
simple
scheme
of
life
work
and
prayer
prayer
and
work
stood
no
doubt
as
alternative
and
complementary
duties
but
you
are
not
half
warmly
enough
covered
up
said
peter
he
fetched
his
and
spread
it
over
her
then
he
went
to
the
kitchen
where
she
had
left
a
fire
burning
and
filled
a
bottle
with
hot
water
put
this
at
your
feet
he
said
returning
to
marietta
oh
i
can
not
allow
the
signorino
to
wait
on
me
like
this
the
old
woman
mustered
voice
to
murmur
the
signorino
likes
it
it
affords
him
healthful
exercise
peter
assured
her
carretaji
came
about
noon
a
fat
middleaged
man
with
a
fringe
of
black
hair
round
an
scalp
a
massive
adorned
by
the
inevitable
pointed
bit
of
coral
and
podgy
hairy
hands
but
he
seemed
kind
and
honest
and
he
seemed
to
know
his
business
she
has
a
catarrh
of
the
larynx
with
i
am
afraid
a
beginning
of
bronchitis
was
his
verdict
is
there
any
danger
peter
asked
not
the
slightest
she
must
remain
in
bed
and
take
frequent
nourishment
hot
milk
and
now
and
then
i
will
send
some
medicine
but
the
great
things
are
nourishment
and
warmth
i
will
call
again
gigi
wife
came
she
was
a
tall
stalwart
blackbrowed
young
woman
and
her
name
gigi
eyes
flashed
proudly
as
he
announced
it
her
name
was
carolina
maddalena
peter
had
to
be
in
and
out
of
marietta
room
all
day
to
see
that
she
took
her
and
milk
and
medicine
regularly
she
dozed
a
good
deal
when
she
was
awake
she
said
her
rosary
but
next
day
she
was
manifestly
worse
yes
bronchitis
as
i
feared
said
the
doctor
danger
no
none
if
properly
looked
after
add
a
little
brandy
to
her
milk
and
see
that
she
has
at
least
a
small
cupful
every
i
think
it
would
be
easier
for
you
if
you
had
a
nurse
someone
should
be
with
her
at
night
there
is
a
convent
of
mercy
at
venzona
if
you
like
i
will
telephone
for
a
thank
you
very
much
i
hope
you
will
said
peter
and
that
afternoon
sister
scholastica
arrived
and
established
herself
in
the
sister
scholastica
was
young
pale
serene
competent
but
sometimes
she
had
to
send
for
peter
she
refuses
to
take
her
milk
possibly
she
will
take
it
from
you
the
sister
said
then
peter
would
assume
a
perhaps
tone
of
mastery
come
marietta
you
must
take
your
milk
the
signorino
wishes
it
you
must
not
disobey
the
and
marietta
with
a
groan
would
rouse
herself
and
take
it
peter
holding
the
cup
to
her
lips
on
the
third
day
in
the
morning
sister
scholastica
said
she
imagines
that
she
is
worse
i
do
not
think
so
myself
but
she
keeps
repeating
that
she
is
going
to
die
she
wishes
to
see
a
priest
i
think
it
would
make
her
feel
easier
can
you
send
for
the
parrocco
please
let
him
know
that
it
is
not
an
occasion
for
the
sacraments
but
it
would
do
her
good
if
he
would
come
and
talk
with
and
the
doctor
who
arrived
just
then
having
visited
marietta
confirmed
the
sister
opinion
she
is
no
worse
she
is
if
anything
rather
better
her
malady
is
taking
its
natural
course
but
people
of
her
class
always
fancy
they
are
going
to
die
if
they
are
ill
enough
to
stay
in
bed
it
is
the
panic
of
ignorance
yes
i
think
it
would
do
her
good
to
see
a
priest
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
the
so
peter
sent
gigi
to
the
village
for
the
parrocco
and
gigi
came
back
with
the
intelligence
that
the
parrocco
was
away
making
a
retreat
and
would
not
return
till
saturday
was
wednesday
what
shall
we
do
now
peter
asked
of
sister
scholastica
there
is
monsignor
langshawe
at
castel
ventirose
said
the
sister
could
i
ask
him
to
come
peter
doubted
certainly
said
the
sister
in
a
case
of
illness
the
nearest
priest
will
always
gladly
so
peter
despatched
gigi
with
a
note
to
monsignor
langshawe
and
presently
up
drove
a
brougham
with
gigi
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
and
from
the
brougham
descended
not
monsignor
langshawe
but
cardinal
udeschini
followed
by
emilia
manfredi
the
cardinal
gave
peter
his
hand
with
a
smile
so
sweet
so
benign
so
it
was
like
music
peter
thought
it
was
like
a
silent
anthem
monsignor
langshawe
has
gone
to
scotland
for
his
holiday
i
have
come
in
his
place
your
man
told
me
of
your
need
the
cardinal
explained
i
do
know
how
to
thank
your
eminence
peter
murmured
and
conducted
him
to
marietta
room
sister
scholastica
genuflected
and
kissed
the
cardinal
ring
and
received
his
benediction
then
she
and
peter
withdrew
and
went
into
the
garden
the
sister
joined
emilia
and
they
walked
backwards
and
forwards
together
talking
peter
sat
on
his
rustic
bench
smoked
cigarettes
and
waited
nearly
an
hour
passed
at
length
the
cardinal
came
out
peter
rose
and
went
forward
to
meet
him
the
cardinal
was
smiling
but
about
his
eyes
there
was
a
suggestive
redness
mr
marchdale
he
said
your
housekeeper
is
in
great
distress
of
conscience
touching
one
or
two
offences
she
feels
she
has
been
guilty
of
towards
you
they
seem
to
me
in
frankness
somewhat
trifling
but
i
can
not
persuade
her
to
accept
my
view
she
will
not
be
happy
till
she
has
asked
and
received
your
pardon
for
offences
towards
me
peter
wondered
unless
excess
of
patience
with
a
very
trying
employer
constitutes
an
offence
she
has
been
guilty
of
never
mind
said
the
cardinal
her
conscience
accuses
her
she
must
satisfy
it
will
you
come
the
cardinal
sat
down
at
the
head
of
marietta
bed
and
took
her
hand
now
dear
he
said
with
the
gentleness
the
tenderness
of
one
speaking
to
a
beloved
child
here
is
marchdale
tell
him
what
you
have
on
your
mind
he
is
ready
to
hear
and
to
forgive
marietta
fixed
her
eyes
anxiously
on
peter
face
first
she
whispered
i
wish
to
beg
the
signorino
to
pardon
all
this
trouble
i
am
making
for
him
i
am
the
signorino
servant
but
instead
of
serving
i
make
trouble
for
she
paused
the
cardinal
smiled
at
peter
peter
answered
marietta
if
you
talk
like
that
you
will
make
the
signorino
cry
you
are
the
best
servant
that
ever
lived
you
are
putting
me
to
no
trouble
at
all
you
are
giving
me
a
chance
which
i
should
be
glad
of
except
that
it
involves
your
suffering
to
show
my
affection
for
you
and
my
there
dear
said
the
cardinal
to
her
you
see
the
signorino
makes
nothing
of
that
now
the
next
thing
go
i
have
to
ask
the
signorino
forgiveness
for
my
impertinence
whispered
marietta
impertinence
faltered
peter
you
have
never
been
scusi
signorino
she
went
on
in
her
whisper
i
have
sometimes
contradicted
the
signorino
i
contradicted
the
signorino
when
he
told
me
that
anthony
of
padua
was
born
in
lisbon
it
is
impertinent
of
a
servant
to
contradict
her
master
and
now
his
most
high
eminence
says
the
signorino
was
right
i
beg
the
signorino
to
forgive
again
the
cardinal
smiled
at
peter
you
dear
old
woman
peter
half
laughed
half
sobbed
how
can
you
ask
me
to
forgive
a
mere
difference
of
opinion
you
you
dear
old
the
cardinal
smiled
and
patted
marietta
hand
the
signorino
is
too
good
marietta
sighed
go
on
dear
said
the
cardinal
i
have
been
guilty
of
the
deadly
sin
of
evil
speaking
i
have
spoken
evil
of
the
signorino
she
went
on
i
said
i
said
to
people
that
the
signorino
was
simple
that
he
was
simple
and
natural
i
thought
so
then
now
i
know
it
is
not
so
i
know
it
is
only
that
the
signorino
is
once
more
the
cardinal
smiled
at
peter
again
peter
half
laughed
half
sobbed
marietta
of
course
i
am
simple
and
natural
at
least
i
try
to
be
come
look
up
smile
promise
you
will
not
worry
about
these
things
any
she
looked
up
she
smiled
faintly
the
signorino
is
too
good
she
whispered
after
a
little
interval
of
silence
now
dear
said
the
cardinal
the
last
thing
of
marietta
gave
a
groan
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
on
her
pillow
you
need
not
be
afraid
said
the
cardinal
mr
marchdale
will
certainly
forgive
groaned
marietta
she
stared
at
the
ceiling
for
an
instant
the
cardinal
patted
her
hand
courage
courage
he
said
oh
signorino
mio
she
groaned
again
this
you
never
can
forgive
me
it
is
about
the
little
pig
the
porcellino
the
signorino
remembers
the
little
pig
which
he
called
francesco
yes
answered
peter
the
signorino
told
me
to
take
the
little
pig
away
to
find
a
home
for
him
and
i
told
the
signorino
that
i
would
take
him
to
my
nephew
who
is
a
farmer
towards
fogliamo
the
signorino
remembers
yes
answered
peter
yes
you
dear
old
thing
i
marietta
drew
a
deep
breath
summoned
her
utmost
fortitude
well
i
did
not
take
him
to
my
nephew
the
the
signorino
ate
peter
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
he
could
only
utter
a
kind
of
oh
yes
whispered
marietta
he
was
bought
with
the
signorino
money
i
did
not
like
to
see
the
signorino
money
wasted
so
i
deceived
the
signorino
you
ate
him
as
a
this
time
peter
did
laugh
i
am
afraid
even
the
cardinal
well
his
smile
was
perilously
near
a
titter
he
took
a
big
pinch
of
snuff
i
killed
francesco
and
i
deceived
the
signorino
i
am
very
sorry
marietta
said
peter
knelt
down
at
her
bedside
marietta
your
conscience
is
too
sensitive
as
for
killing
francesco
we
are
all
mortal
he
could
not
have
lived
forever
and
as
for
deceiving
the
signorino
you
did
it
for
his
own
good
i
remember
that
it
was
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
you
must
not
worry
any
more
about
the
little
marietta
turned
her
face
towards
him
and
smiled
the
signorino
forgives
his
servant
she
whispered
peter
could
not
help
it
he
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
brown
old
cheek
she
will
be
easier
now
said
the
cardinal
i
will
stay
with
her
a
little
peter
went
out
the
scene
had
been
childish
do
you
say
ridiculous
almost
farcical
indeed
and
yet
somehow
it
seemed
to
peter
that
his
heart
was
full
of
unshed
tears
at
the
same
time
as
he
thought
of
the
cardinal
as
he
saw
his
face
his
smile
as
he
heard
the
intonations
of
his
voice
the
words
he
had
spoken
as
he
thought
of
the
way
he
had
held
marietta
hand
and
patted
it
at
the
same
time
a
kind
of
strange
joy
seemed
to
fill
his
heart
a
strange
feeling
of
exaltation
of
enthusiasm
what
a
heavenly
old
man
he
said
in
the
garden
sister
scholastica
and
emilia
were
still
walking
together
they
halted
when
peter
came
out
and
emilia
said
with
your
consent
signore
sister
scholastica
has
accepted
me
as
her
lieutenant
i
will
come
every
morning
and
sit
with
marietta
during
the
day
that
will
relieve
the
sister
who
has
to
be
up
with
her
at
and
every
morning
after
that
emilia
came
walking
through
the
park
and
crossing
the
river
by
the
which
peter
left
now
permanently
in
its
position
and
once
or
twice
a
week
in
the
afternoon
the
cardinal
would
drive
up
in
the
brougham
and
having
paid
a
little
visit
to
marietta
would
drive
emilia
home
in
the
emilia
would
read
to
marietta
or
say
the
rosary
for
her
marietta
mended
steadily
day
by
day
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
was
able
to
leave
her
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
and
sit
in
the
sun
in
the
garden
then
sister
scholastica
went
back
to
her
convent
at
venzona
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
marietta
could
be
up
all
day
but
gigi
stalwart
carolina
maddalena
continued
to
rule
as
vicereine
in
the
kitchen
and
emilia
continued
to
come
every
morning
why
does
the
duchessa
never
come
peter
wondered
it
would
be
decent
of
her
to
come
and
see
the
poor
old
whenever
he
thought
of
cardinal
udeschini
the
same
strange
feeling
of
joy
would
spring
up
in
his
heart
which
he
had
felt
when
he
had
left
the
beautiful
old
man
with
marietta
on
the
day
of
his
first
visit
in
the
beginning
he
could
only
give
this
feeling
a
very
general
and
indefinite
expression
he
is
a
man
who
renews
one
faith
in
things
who
renews
one
faith
in
human
but
gradually
i
suppose
the
feeling
crystallised
and
at
last
in
due
season
it
found
for
itself
an
expression
that
was
not
so
indefinite
it
was
in
the
afternoon
and
he
had
just
conducted
the
cardinal
and
emilia
to
their
carriage
he
stood
at
his
gate
for
a
minute
and
watched
the
carriage
as
it
rolled
away
what
a
heavenly
old
man
what
a
heavenly
old
man
he
thought
then
still
looking
after
the
carriage
before
turning
back
into
his
garden
he
heard
himself
repeat
half
aloud
nor
knowest
thou
what
argument
thy
life
to
thy
neighbour
creed
hath
the
words
had
come
to
his
lips
and
were
pronounced
were
addressed
to
his
mental
image
of
the
cardinal
without
any
conscious
act
of
volition
on
his
part
he
heard
them
with
a
sort
of
surprise
almost
as
if
some
one
else
had
spoken
them
he
could
not
in
the
least
remember
what
poem
they
were
from
he
could
not
even
remember
what
poet
they
were
by
were
they
by
emerson
it
was
years
since
he
had
read
a
line
of
emerson
all
that
evening
the
couplet
kept
running
in
his
head
and
the
feeling
of
joy
of
enthusiasm
in
his
heart
was
not
so
strange
now
but
i
think
it
was
intensified
the
next
time
the
cardinal
arrived
at
villa
floriano
and
gave
peter
his
hand
peter
did
not
merely
shake
it
english
fashion
as
he
had
hitherto
done
the
cardinal
looked
startled
then
his
eyes
searched
peter
face
for
a
second
keenly
interrogative
then
they
softened
and
a
wonderful
clear
light
shone
in
them
a
wonderful
pure
sweet
light
benedicat
te
omnipotens
deus
pater
et
filius
et
spiritus
sanctus
he
said
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
xxvii
up
at
the
castle
cardinal
udeschini
was
walking
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
terrace
reading
his
breviary
beatrice
was
seated
under
the
white
awning
at
the
doing
some
kind
of
needlework
presently
the
cardinal
came
to
a
standstill
near
her
and
closed
his
book
putting
his
finger
in
it
to
keep
the
place
it
will
be
of
course
a
great
loss
to
casa
udeschini
when
you
marry
he
remarked
beatrice
looked
up
astonishment
on
her
brow
when
i
marry
she
exclaimed
well
if
ever
there
was
a
thunderbolt
from
a
clear
sky
and
she
laughed
you
marry
the
cardinal
repeated
with
conviction
you
are
a
young
woman
you
are
years
old
you
will
marry
it
is
only
right
that
you
should
marry
you
have
not
the
vocation
for
a
religious
therefore
you
must
marry
but
it
will
be
a
great
loss
to
the
house
of
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
said
beatrice
laughing
again
i
have
the
remotest
thought
of
marrying
i
shall
never
il
ne
faut
jamais
dire
a
la
fontaine
je
ne
boirai
pas
de
ton
eau
his
eminence
cautioned
her
whilst
the
lines
of
humour
about
his
mouth
emphasised
themselves
and
his
grey
eyes
twinkled
other
things
equal
marriage
is
as
much
the
proper
state
for
the
laity
as
celibacy
is
the
proper
state
for
the
clergy
you
will
marry
it
would
be
selfish
of
us
to
oppose
your
marrying
you
ought
to
marry
but
it
will
be
a
great
loss
to
the
family
it
will
be
a
great
personal
loss
to
me
you
are
as
dear
to
me
as
any
of
my
blood
i
am
always
forgetting
that
we
are
uncle
and
niece
by
courtesy
i
shall
never
marry
but
nothing
that
can
happen
to
me
can
ever
make
the
faintest
difference
in
my
feeling
for
you
i
hope
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
she
looked
into
his
eyes
smiling
her
love
you
are
only
my
uncle
by
courtesy
but
you
are
more
than
an
uncle
you
have
been
like
a
father
to
me
ever
since
i
left
my
the
cardinal
returned
her
smile
carissima
he
murmured
then
it
will
be
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
however
he
went
on
that
when
the
time
comes
you
should
marry
a
good
man
a
suitable
man
a
man
who
will
love
you
whom
you
will
love
and
if
possible
a
man
who
will
not
altogether
separate
you
from
me
who
will
perhaps
love
me
a
little
too
it
would
send
me
in
sorrow
to
my
grave
if
you
should
marry
a
man
who
was
not
worthy
of
i
will
guard
against
that
danger
by
not
marrying
at
all
laughed
beatrice
no
you
will
marry
some
day
said
the
cardinal
and
i
wish
you
to
remember
that
i
shall
not
oppose
your
marrying
provided
the
man
is
a
good
man
felipe
will
not
like
it
guido
will
pull
a
long
nose
but
i
at
least
will
take
your
part
if
i
can
feel
that
the
man
is
good
good
men
are
rare
my
dear
good
husbands
are
rarer
still
i
can
think
for
instance
of
no
man
in
our
roman
nobility
whom
i
should
be
content
to
see
you
marry
therefore
i
hope
you
will
not
marry
a
roman
you
would
be
more
likely
to
marry
one
of
your
own
countrymen
that
of
course
would
double
the
loss
to
us
if
it
should
take
you
away
from
italy
but
remember
if
he
is
a
man
whom
i
can
think
worthy
of
you
you
may
count
upon
me
as
an
he
resumed
his
walk
reopening
his
breviary
beatrice
resumed
her
needlework
but
she
found
it
difficult
to
fix
her
attention
on
it
every
now
and
then
she
would
leave
her
needle
stuck
across
its
seam
let
the
work
drop
to
her
lap
and
with
eyes
turned
vaguely
up
the
valley
fall
apparently
into
a
muse
i
wonder
why
he
said
all
that
to
me
was
the
question
that
kept
posing
itself
by
and
by
the
cardinal
closed
his
breviary
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
suppose
he
had
finished
his
office
for
the
day
then
he
came
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
wicker
chairs
under
the
awning
on
the
table
among
the
books
and
things
stood
a
carafe
of
water
some
tumblers
a
silver
and
a
crystal
dish
full
of
fresh
pomegranate
seeds
it
looked
like
a
dish
full
of
unset
rubies
the
cardinal
poured
some
water
into
a
tumbler
added
a
lump
of
sugar
and
a
spoonful
of
pomegranate
seeds
stirred
the
mixture
till
it
became
and
drank
it
off
in
a
series
of
little
sips
what
is
the
matter
beatrice
he
asked
all
at
once
beatrice
raised
her
eyes
perplexed
the
matter
is
anything
the
matter
yes
said
the
cardinal
something
is
the
matter
you
are
depressed
you
are
nervous
you
are
not
yourself
i
have
noticed
it
for
many
days
have
you
something
on
your
mind
nothing
in
the
world
beatrice
answered
with
an
appearance
of
great
candour
i
had
not
noticed
that
i
was
nervous
or
we
are
entering
october
said
the
cardinal
i
must
return
to
rome
i
have
been
absent
too
long
already
i
must
return
next
week
but
i
should
not
like
to
go
away
with
the
feeling
that
you
are
if
a
thing
were
needed
to
make
me
unhappy
it
would
be
the
announcement
of
your
intended
departure
beatrice
said
smiling
but
otherwise
i
am
no
more
unhappy
than
it
is
natural
to
be
life
after
all
is
such
a
furiously
gay
business
as
to
keep
one
perpetually
singing
and
dancing
is
it
but
i
am
not
especially
h
said
the
cardinal
then
in
a
minute
you
will
come
to
rome
in
november
i
suppose
he
asked
yes
towards
the
end
of
november
i
think
said
beatrice
the
cardinal
rose
and
began
to
walk
backwards
and
forwards
again
in
a
little
while
the
sound
of
could
be
heard
in
the
sweep
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
cardinal
looked
at
his
watch
here
is
the
carriage
he
said
i
must
go
down
and
see
that
poor
old
woman
do
you
know
he
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
think
it
would
be
well
if
you
were
to
go
with
a
shadow
came
into
beatrice
eyes
what
good
would
that
do
she
asked
it
would
give
her
pleasure
no
doubt
and
besides
she
is
one
of
your
parishioners
as
it
were
i
think
you
ought
to
go
you
have
never
been
to
see
her
since
she
fell
oh
well
said
beatrice
she
was
plainly
unwilling
but
she
went
to
put
on
her
things
in
the
carriage
when
they
had
passed
the
village
and
crossed
the
bridge
as
they
were
bowling
along
the
straight
white
road
that
led
to
the
villa
what
a
long
time
it
is
since
marchdale
has
been
at
ventirose
remarked
the
cardinal
oh
is
it
responded
beatrice
with
indifference
it
is
more
than
three
weeks
i
think
it
is
nearly
a
month
the
cardinal
said
oh
said
she
he
has
had
his
hands
full
of
course
he
has
had
little
leisure
the
cardinal
pursued
his
devotion
to
his
poor
old
servant
has
been
quite
admirable
but
now
that
she
is
practically
recovered
he
will
be
yes
said
beatrice
he
is
a
young
man
whom
i
like
very
much
said
the
cardinal
he
is
intelligent
he
has
good
manners
and
he
has
a
fine
sense
of
the
droll
yes
he
has
wit
a
wit
that
you
seldom
find
in
an
a
wit
that
is
almost
latin
but
you
have
lost
your
interest
in
him
that
is
because
you
despair
of
his
conversion
i
confess
i
am
not
greatly
interested
in
him
beatrice
answered
and
i
certainly
have
no
hopes
of
his
the
cardinal
smiled
at
his
ring
he
opened
his
snuffbox
and
inhaled
a
long
deliberate
pinch
of
snuff
ah
well
who
can
tell
he
said
but
he
will
be
free
now
and
it
is
so
long
since
he
has
been
at
the
castle
had
you
not
better
ask
him
to
luncheon
or
dinner
why
should
i
answered
beatrice
if
he
does
not
come
to
ventirose
it
is
presumably
because
he
does
not
care
to
come
if
he
does
care
to
come
he
needs
no
invitation
he
knows
that
he
is
at
liberty
to
call
whenever
he
but
it
would
be
civil
it
would
be
neighbourly
to
ask
him
to
a
meal
the
cardinal
submitted
and
it
would
put
him
in
the
embarrassing
predicament
of
having
either
to
accept
against
his
will
or
to
decline
and
appear
ungracious
submitted
beatrice
no
it
is
evident
that
ventirose
does
not
amuse
bene
said
the
cardinal
be
it
as
you
but
when
they
reached
villa
floriano
peter
was
not
at
home
he
has
gone
to
spiaggia
for
the
day
emilia
informed
them
beatrice
the
cardinal
fancied
looked
at
once
relieved
and
disappointed
marietta
was
seated
in
the
sun
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
garden
while
beatrice
talked
with
her
the
cardinal
walked
about
now
it
so
happened
that
on
peter
rustic
table
a
book
lay
open
face
downwards
the
cardinal
saw
the
book
he
halted
in
his
walk
and
glanced
round
the
garden
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
observed
he
tapped
his
snuff
box
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
he
appeared
to
meditate
for
an
instant
the
lines
about
his
mouth
becoming
very
marked
indeed
at
last
swiftly
stealthily
almost
with
the
air
of
a
man
committing
felony
he
slipped
his
under
the
open
book
well
under
it
so
that
it
was
completely
covered
up
on
the
way
back
to
ventirose
the
cardinal
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
dear
me
he
suddenly
exclaimed
i
have
lost
my
snuff
box
he
shook
his
head
as
one
who
recognises
a
fatality
i
am
always
losing
are
you
sure
you
had
it
with
you
beatrice
asked
oh
yes
i
think
i
had
it
with
me
i
should
have
missed
it
before
this
if
i
had
left
it
at
home
i
must
have
dropped
it
in
in
that
case
it
will
probably
be
found
said
beatrice
peter
had
gone
to
spiaggia
i
imagine
in
the
hope
of
meeting
florence
but
the
printed
visitors
list
there
told
him
that
she
had
left
nearly
a
fortnight
since
on
his
return
to
the
villa
he
was
greeted
by
marietta
with
the
proud
tidings
that
her
excellency
the
duchessa
di
santangiolo
had
been
to
see
her
oh
really
he
questioned
lightly
his
heart
i
think
dropped
a
beat
all
the
same
ang
said
marietta
she
came
with
the
most
eminent
prince
cardinal
they
came
in
the
carriage
she
stayed
half
an
hour
she
was
very
ah
said
peter
i
am
glad
to
hear
she
was
beautifully
dressed
said
marietta
of
that
i
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
said
he
the
signorina
emilia
drove
away
with
them
said
she
dear
dear
what
a
chapter
of
adventures
was
his
comment
he
went
to
his
rustic
table
and
picked
up
his
book
how
the
deuce
did
that
come
there
he
wondered
discovering
the
snuff
box
it
was
in
truth
an
odd
place
for
it
a
cardinal
may
inadvertently
drop
his
snuff
box
to
be
sure
but
if
the
whole
college
of
cardinals
together
had
dropped
a
snuff
box
it
would
hardly
have
fallen
of
its
own
weight
through
the
covers
of
an
open
book
to
the
thereof
and
have
left
withal
no
trace
of
its
passage
solid
matter
will
not
pass
through
solid
matter
without
fraction
i
learned
that
at
school
said
peter
the
inference
would
be
that
someone
had
purposely
put
the
snuff
box
there
but
who
the
cardinal
himself
in
the
name
of
reason
why
emilia
nonsense
marietta
absurd
the
du
a
wild
surmise
darted
through
peter
soul
could
it
be
could
it
conceivably
be
was
it
possible
that
that
was
it
possible
in
fine
that
this
was
a
kind
of
signal
a
kind
of
summons
oh
no
no
no
and
yet
and
yet
no
certainly
not
the
idea
was
preposterous
it
deserved
and
i
trust
obtained
summary
deletion
nevertheless
said
peter
it
a
long
while
since
i
have
darkened
the
doors
of
ventirose
and
a
poor
excuse
is
better
than
none
and
anyhow
the
cardinal
will
be
glad
to
have
his
the
was
in
its
place
he
crossed
the
aco
xxviii
he
crossed
the
aco
and
struck
bravely
forward
up
the
smooth
lawns
under
the
bending
trees
towards
the
castle
the
sun
was
setting
the
irregular
mass
of
buildings
stood
out
in
varying
shades
of
blue
against
varying
dying
shades
of
red
half
way
there
peter
stopped
and
looked
back
the
level
sunshine
turned
the
black
forests
of
the
gnisi
to
shining
forests
of
bronze
and
the
foaming
cascade
that
leapt
down
its
side
to
a
cascade
of
liquid
gold
the
lake
for
the
greater
part
lay
in
shadow
through
a
veil
of
mist
but
along
the
opposite
shore
it
caught
the
light
and
gleamed
a
crescent
of
quicksilver
with
roseate
reflections
the
three
of
monte
sfiorito
at
the
valley
end
seemed
almost
insubstantial
floating
forms
of
luminous
pink
vapour
above
the
hazy
horizon
in
a
pure
sky
intensely
blue
a
familiar
verse
came
into
peter
mind
really
he
said
to
himself
down
to
the
very
leaping
in
glory
i
believe
they
must
have
the
scene
feature
for
feature
to
illustrate
and
he
began
to
repeat
the
vivid
musical
lines
under
his
breath
but
about
midway
of
them
he
was
interrupted
it
not
altogether
a
bad
sort
of
view
is
it
a
voice
asked
behind
him
peter
faced
about
on
a
marble
bench
under
a
feathery
acacia
a
few
yards
away
a
lady
was
seated
looking
at
him
smiling
peter
eyes
met
hers
and
suddenly
his
heart
gave
a
jump
then
it
stood
dead
still
for
a
second
then
it
flew
off
racing
perilously
oh
for
the
best
reasons
in
the
world
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
glow
a
softness
that
seemed
that
seemed
but
thereby
hangs
my
tale
she
was
dressed
in
white
she
had
some
big
chrysanthemums
stuck
in
her
belt
she
wore
no
hat
her
hair
brown
and
warm
in
shadow
sparkled
where
the
sun
touched
it
transparent
and
iridescent
like
crinkly
threads
of
glass
you
do
not
think
it
altogether
bad
i
hope
she
questioned
arching
her
eyebrows
slightly
with
a
droll
little
assumption
of
concern
peter
heart
was
racing
but
he
must
answer
her
i
was
just
wondering
he
answered
with
a
tolerably
successful
feint
of
composure
whether
one
might
not
safely
call
it
altogether
oh
she
exclaimed
she
threw
back
her
head
and
examined
the
prospect
critically
afterwards
she
returned
her
gaze
to
peter
with
an
air
of
polite
readiness
to
defer
to
his
opinion
it
is
not
too
sensational
not
too
much
like
a
landscape
on
the
stage
we
must
judge
it
leniently
said
he
we
must
remember
that
it
is
only
unaided
nature
besides
he
added
to
be
meticulously
truthful
there
is
a
spaciousness
there
is
a
vivacity
in
the
light
and
colour
there
is
a
sense
of
depth
and
atmosphere
that
we
should
hardly
find
in
a
landscape
on
the
yes
perhaps
there
is
she
admitted
thoughtfully
and
with
that
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
and
laughed
are
you
aware
the
lady
asked
after
a
brief
silence
that
it
is
a
singularly
lovely
i
have
a
hundred
reasons
for
thinking
it
so
peter
answered
with
the
least
approach
to
a
meaning
bow
in
the
lady
face
there
flickered
perhaps
for
half
a
second
the
faintest
light
as
of
a
comprehending
and
unresentful
smile
but
she
went
on
with
fine
detachment
how
calm
and
still
it
is
the
wonderful
peace
of
the
day
compline
it
seems
as
if
the
earth
had
stopped
breathing
does
it
the
birds
have
already
gone
to
bed
though
the
sun
is
only
just
setting
it
is
the
hour
when
they
are
generally
noisiest
but
they
have
gone
to
bed
the
sparrows
and
the
finches
the
snatchers
and
the
are
equal
in
the
article
of
sleep
that
is
because
they
feel
the
touch
of
autumn
how
beautiful
it
is
in
spite
of
its
sadness
this
first
touch
of
autumn
it
is
like
sad
distant
music
can
you
analyse
it
can
you
explain
it
there
is
no
chill
it
is
quite
warm
and
yet
one
knows
somehow
that
autumn
is
here
the
birds
know
it
and
have
gone
to
bed
in
another
month
they
will
be
flying
away
to
africa
and
the
hesperides
all
of
them
except
the
sparrows
who
stay
all
winter
i
wonder
how
they
get
on
during
the
winter
with
no
goldfinches
to
snatch
from
she
turned
to
peter
with
a
look
of
respectful
enquiry
as
one
appealing
to
an
authority
for
information
oh
they
snatch
from
each
other
during
the
winter
he
explained
it
is
thief
rob
thief
when
honest
victims
are
not
forthcoming
and
what
is
more
to
the
point
they
must
keep
their
beaks
in
against
the
return
of
the
goldfinches
with
the
the
duchessa
for
i
scorn
to
deceive
the
trustful
reader
longer
and
as
certain
fines
mouches
despite
my
efforts
at
concealment
may
ere
this
have
suspected
the
mysterious
lady
was
no
one
else
the
duchessa
gaily
laughed
yes
she
said
the
goldfinches
will
return
with
the
spring
but
that
rather
foolish
of
them
if
i
were
a
goldfinch
i
think
i
should
make
my
abode
permanent
in
the
sparrowless
there
is
no
sparrowless
south
said
peter
sparrows
alas
abound
in
every
latitude
and
the
farther
south
you
go
the
fiercer
and
bolder
and
more
impudent
they
become
in
africa
and
the
hesperides
which
you
have
mentioned
they
not
infrequently
attack
the
caravans
peck
the
eyes
out
of
the
camels
and
are
sometimes
even
known
to
carry
off
a
man
a
whole
man
vainly
struggling
in
their
inexorable
talons
there
is
no
sparrowless
south
but
as
for
the
goldfinches
returning
it
is
the
instinct
of
us
bipeds
to
return
plumed
and
plumeless
we
all
return
to
something
what
though
we
may
have
registered
the
most
solemn
vows
to
remain
he
delivered
his
last
phrases
with
an
accent
he
punctuated
them
with
a
glance
in
which
there
may
have
lurked
an
intention
but
the
duchessa
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
yes
true
so
we
do
she
assented
vaguely
and
what
you
tell
me
of
the
sparrows
in
the
hesperides
is
very
novel
and
impressive
unless
indeed
it
is
a
mere
traveller
tale
with
which
you
are
seeking
to
practise
upon
my
credulity
but
since
i
find
you
in
this
communicative
vein
will
you
not
push
complaisance
a
further
and
tell
me
what
that
thing
is
suspended
there
in
the
sky
above
the
crest
of
the
cornobastone
that
pale
round
thing
that
looks
like
the
spectre
of
a
magnified
peter
turned
to
the
quarter
her
gaze
indicated
oh
that
he
said
is
nothing
in
frankness
it
is
only
what
the
vulgar
style
the
how
odd
said
she
i
thought
it
was
what
the
vulgar
style
the
and
they
both
laughed
again
the
duchessa
moved
a
little
and
thus
she
uncovered
carved
on
the
back
of
her
marble
bench
and
blazoned
in
red
and
gold
a
coat
of
arms
she
touched
the
shield
with
her
finger
are
you
interested
in
canting
heraldry
she
asked
there
is
no
country
so
rich
in
it
as
italy
these
are
the
arms
of
the
farfalla
the
original
owners
of
this
property
or
seme
of
twenty
roses
gules
the
crest
on
a
rose
gules
a
butterfly
or
with
wings
displayed
and
the
motto
how
could
the
heralds
ever
have
sanctioned
such
an
unheraldic
and
unheroic
motto
rosa
amorosa
farfalla
giojosa
mi
cantano
al
cuore
la
gioja
e
l
amore
they
were
the
great
people
of
this
region
for
countless
generations
the
farfalla
they
were
princes
of
ventirose
and
patricians
of
milan
and
then
the
last
of
them
was
ruined
at
monte
carlo
and
killed
himself
there
years
ago
that
is
how
all
their
gioja
and
amore
ended
it
was
the
case
of
a
butterfly
literally
broken
upon
a
wheel
the
estate
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
jews
as
everything
more
or
less
does
sooner
or
later
and
they
if
you
can
believe
me
they
were
going
to
turn
the
castle
into
an
hotel
into
one
of
those
monstrous
modern
hotels
for
other
jews
to
come
to
when
i
happened
to
hear
of
it
and
bought
it
fancy
turning
that
splendid
old
castle
into
a
hotel
it
is
one
of
the
few
castles
in
italy
that
have
a
ghost
oh
but
a
quite
authentic
ghost
it
is
called
the
white
page
il
paggio
bianco
di
ventirose
it
is
the
ghost
of
a
boy
about
sixteen
he
walks
on
the
ramparts
of
the
old
keep
and
looks
off
towards
the
lake
as
if
he
were
watching
a
boat
and
sometimes
he
waves
his
arms
as
if
he
were
signalling
and
from
head
to
foot
he
is
perfectly
white
like
a
statue
i
have
never
seen
him
myself
but
so
many
people
say
they
have
i
can
not
doubt
he
is
authentic
and
the
jews
wanted
to
turn
this
haunted
castle
into
an
hotel
as
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
the
farfalla
i
take
pains
to
see
that
their
arms
which
are
carved
as
you
see
them
here
in
at
least
a
hundred
different
places
are
remetalled
and
retinctured
as
often
as
time
and
the
weather
render
it
she
looked
towards
the
castle
while
she
spoke
and
now
she
rose
with
the
design
perhaps
of
moving
in
that
direction
peter
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
actualities
it
seems
improbable
he
began
and
i
afraid
you
will
think
there
is
a
tiresome
monotony
in
my
purposes
but
i
am
here
again
to
return
cardinal
udeschini
snuff
box
he
left
it
in
my
oh
said
the
duchessa
yes
he
thought
he
must
have
left
it
there
he
is
always
mislaying
it
happily
he
has
another
for
emergencies
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
trouble
to
bring
it
she
gave
a
light
little
i
may
also
improve
this
occasion
peter
abruptly
continued
to
make
my
adieux
i
shall
be
leaving
for
england
in
a
few
days
the
duchessa
raised
her
eyebrows
really
she
said
oh
that
is
too
bad
she
added
by
way
of
comment
october
you
know
is
regarded
as
the
best
month
of
all
the
twelve
in
this
lake
yes
i
know
it
peter
responded
regretfully
and
it
is
a
horrid
month
in
england
she
went
on
it
is
an
abominable
month
in
england
he
acknowledged
here
it
is
blue
like
larkspur
and
all
fragrant
of
the
vintage
and
joyous
with
the
songs
of
the
vintagers
she
said
there
it
is
and
songless
and
it
smells
of
yes
he
agreed
but
you
are
a
sportsman
you
go
in
for
shooting
she
conjectured
no
he
answered
i
gave
up
shooting
years
oh
hunting
then
i
hate
hunting
one
is
always
getting
rolled
on
by
one
ah
i
see
it
it
will
be
golf
perhaps
no
it
is
not
even
do
tell
me
it
is
football
do
i
look
as
if
it
were
football
it
is
sheer
homesickness
in
fine
you
are
grieving
for
the
purple
of
your
native
heather
there
is
scarcely
any
heather
in
my
native
county
no
said
peter
no
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
the
usual
thing
it
is
an
histoire
de
i
have
guessed
it
she
exclaimed
it
is
still
that
everlasting
that
everlasting
woman
peter
faltered
to
be
sure
said
she
the
woman
you
are
always
going
on
about
the
woman
of
your
novel
this
woman
in
and
she
produced
from
behind
her
back
a
hand
that
she
had
kept
there
and
held
up
for
his
inspection
a
bound
book
my
novel
faltered
he
but
the
sight
of
it
in
her
possession
in
these
particular
circumstances
gave
him
a
thrill
that
was
not
a
thrill
of
despair
your
novel
she
repeated
smiling
sweetly
and
mimicking
his
tone
then
she
made
a
little
moue
of
course
i
have
known
that
you
were
your
friend
felix
wildmay
from
the
oh
said
peter
in
a
feeble
sort
of
gasp
looking
bewildered
you
have
known
that
from
the
outset
and
his
brain
seemed
to
reel
yes
said
she
of
course
where
would
the
fun
have
been
otherwise
and
now
you
are
going
away
back
to
her
shrine
to
renew
your
worship
i
hope
you
will
find
the
courage
to
offer
her
your
peter
brain
was
reeling
but
here
was
the
opportunity
of
his
life
you
give
me
courage
he
pronounced
with
sudden
daring
you
are
in
a
position
to
help
me
with
her
and
since
you
know
so
much
i
should
like
you
to
know
more
i
should
like
to
tell
you
who
she
one
should
be
careful
where
one
bestows
one
confidences
she
warned
him
but
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
glow
a
softness
that
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
invite
them
no
he
said
better
than
telling
you
who
she
is
i
will
tell
you
where
i
first
saw
her
it
was
at
the
francais
in
december
four
years
ago
a
thursday
night
a
subscription
night
she
sat
in
one
of
the
middle
boxes
of
the
first
tier
she
was
dressed
in
white
her
companions
were
an
elderly
woman
english
i
think
in
black
who
wore
a
cap
and
an
old
man
with
white
moustache
and
imperial
who
looked
as
if
he
might
be
a
french
officer
and
the
play
he
broke
off
and
looked
at
the
duchessa
she
kept
her
eyes
down
yes
the
play
she
questioned
in
a
low
voice
after
a
little
wait
the
play
was
monsieur
pailleron
monde
ou
he
said
oh
said
she
still
keeping
her
eyes
down
her
voice
was
still
very
low
but
there
was
something
in
it
that
made
peter
heart
leap
the
next
time
i
saw
her
he
began
but
then
he
had
to
stop
he
felt
as
if
the
beating
of
his
heart
must
suffocate
him
yes
the
next
time
she
questioned
he
drew
a
deep
breath
he
began
anew
the
next
time
was
a
week
later
at
the
opera
they
were
giving
lohengrin
she
was
with
the
same
man
and
woman
and
there
was
another
younger
man
she
had
pearls
round
her
neck
and
in
her
hair
and
she
had
a
cloak
lined
with
white
fur
she
left
before
the
opera
was
over
i
did
not
see
her
again
until
the
following
may
when
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
in
london
driving
in
the
park
she
was
always
with
the
same
elderly
englishwoman
but
the
old
frenchman
had
disappeared
and
then
i
saw
her
once
more
a
year
later
in
paris
driving
in
the
the
duchessa
kept
her
eyes
down
she
did
not
speak
peter
waited
as
long
as
could
wait
looking
at
her
well
he
pleaded
at
last
that
is
all
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
she
raised
her
eyes
and
for
the
tiniest
fraction
of
a
second
they
gave
themselves
to
his
then
she
dropped
them
again
you
are
sure
she
asked
you
are
perfectly
sure
that
when
afterwards
you
met
her
and
came
to
know
her
as
she
really
is
you
are
perfectly
sure
there
was
no
disappointment
disappointment
cried
peter
she
is
in
every
way
immeasurably
beyond
anything
that
i
was
capable
of
dreaming
oh
if
you
could
see
her
if
you
could
hear
her
speak
if
you
could
look
into
her
eyes
if
you
could
see
her
as
others
see
her
you
would
not
ask
whether
there
was
a
disappointment
she
is
no
the
language
is
not
yet
invented
in
which
i
could
describe
the
duchessa
smiled
softly
to
herself
and
you
are
in
love
with
her
more
or
less
she
asked
i
love
her
so
that
the
bare
imagination
of
being
allowed
to
tell
her
of
my
love
almost
makes
me
faint
with
joy
but
it
is
like
the
story
of
the
poor
squire
who
loved
his
queen
she
is
the
greatest
of
great
ladies
i
am
nobody
she
is
so
beautiful
so
splendid
and
so
high
above
me
it
would
be
the
maddest
presumption
for
me
to
ask
her
for
her
love
to
ask
for
the
love
of
my
queen
and
yet
oh
i
can
say
no
more
god
sees
my
heart
god
knows
how
i
love
and
it
is
on
her
account
because
you
think
your
love
is
hopeless
that
you
are
going
away
that
you
are
going
back
to
england
yes
said
he
she
raised
her
eyes
again
and
again
they
gave
themselves
to
his
there
was
something
in
them
there
was
a
glow
a
softness
do
go
she
said
up
at
the
castle
peter
had
hurried
down
to
the
villa
dressed
and
returned
to
the
castle
to
dine
he
restored
the
to
cardinal
udeschini
i
am
trebly
your
debtor
for
it
said
the
cardinal
