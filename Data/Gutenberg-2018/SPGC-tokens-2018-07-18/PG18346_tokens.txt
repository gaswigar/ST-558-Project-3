his
paunch
as
far
as
the

seat
would
permit
the

its
advent
preceded
by
a
collection
of
aromas
slid
noiselessly
out
of
the
pantry
and
clicked
into
place
in

everything
all
right
miss

a
voice
floated
out
after
it
from
beyond
anything
else
you
want
everything
just
fine
harris
claire
replied
i
suppose
pelton
want
seconds
and
ray
probably
want
thirds
and
fourths
of
everything
she
waved
a
hand
over
the
photocell
that
closed
the
pantry
door
and
slid
into
place
across
from
her
brother
who
already
had
a
glass
of
fruit
juice
in
one
hand
and
was
lifting
platter
covers
with
the
other
real
eggs
the
boy
was
announcing
bacon
toast
he
looked
again
hey
sis
is
this
real
butter
yes
now
go
ahead
and
eat
as
though
ray
needed
encouragement
chester
pelton
thought
watching
his
son
use
a
spoon
the
biggest
one
available
to
dump
gobs
of
honey
on
his
toast
while
he
was
helping
himself
to
bacon
and
eggs
he
could
hear
ray
exclamation
this
is
real
honey
too
that
pleased
him
the
boy
was
a
true
pelton
only
needed
one
bite
to
distinguish
between
real
and
synthetic
food
bet
this
breakfast
did
cost
a
dollar
under
five
c
ray
continued
a
little
more
audibly
between
bites
illustration
that
was
another
pelton
trait
even
at
fifteen
the
boy
was
learning
the
value
of
money
claire
seemed
to
disapprove
however
oh
ray
try
not
to
always
think
of
what
things
cost
she
reproved
if
i
had
all
she
spends
on
natural
food
i
could
have
a
model
like
jimmy
hartnett
ray
continued
pelton
frowned
i
do
want
you
running
around
with
that
boy
ray
he
said
his
mouth
full
of
bacon
and
eggs
under
his
daughter
look
of
disapproval
he
swallowed
hastily
then
continued
he
not
the
sort
of
company
i
want
my
son
keeping
but
senator
ray
protested
he
lives
next
door
to
us
why
we
can
see
hartnett
aerial
from
the
top
of
our
landing
stage
that
does
matter
he
said
in
a
tone
meant
to
indicate
that
the
subject
was
not
to
be
debated
he
a
literate
more
eggs
senator
claire
asked
extending
the
platter
and
gesturing
with
the
serving
knife
he
chuckled
inwardly
claire
always
knew
what
to
do
when
his
temper
started
climbing
to
critical
mass
he
allowed
her
to
load
his
plate
again
and
speaking
of
our
landing
stage
have
you
been
up
there
this
morning
ray
he
asked
they
both
looked
at
him
inquiringly
delivered
last
evening
while
you
two
were
out
he
explained
new
winter
model
he
felt
a
glow
of
paternal
pleasure
as
claire
gave
a
yelp
of
delight
and
aimed
a
glancing
kiss
at
the
top
of
his
bald
head
ray
dropped
his
fork
slid
from
his
seat
and
bolted

for

went
out
to
stop
his
own
not

coffee
and
cigarettes
senator

i

you
just
relax
for
a
while

hard
but

hard
and
today
with

and
the
last
day
of
the

that
idiot
of
a
latterman
have
the
sale
advertised
for
today
anyhow
he
fumed
does
he
know
i
running
for
the
senate
i
doubt
it
claire
said
he
may
have
heard
of
it
the
way
heard
about
an
election
in
pakistan
or
abyssinia
or
he
just
may
not
know
there
is
such
a
thing
as
politics
i
think
he
does
know
there
a
world
outside
the
store
but
he
does
care
much
what
goes
on
in
it
she
pushed
her
plate
aside
poured
a
cup
of
coffee
and
levered
a
cigarette
from
the
readilit
puffing
at
it
with
the
relish
of
the
morning
first
smoke
all
he
knows
is
that
we
holding
our
sale
three
days
ahead
of
macy
gimbel
russ
is
a
good
businessman
pelton
said
seriously
i
wish
take
a
little
more
interest
in
him
claire
if
you
mean
what
i
think
you
do
no
thanks
claire
replied
i
suppose
i
get
married
some
day
most
girls
do
but
it
be
to
somebody
who
can
hang
his
business
up
at
the
office
before
he
comes
home
russ
latterman
is
so
married
to
the
store
that
if
he
married
me
too
it
be
bigamy

for
your
coffee
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
filled
his
cup
and
ejected
a
lighted
cigarette
from
the
box
for
him
then
snapped
on
the
video
screen
it
lit
at
once
and
a
nondescriptly
handsome
young
man
was
grinning
toothily
out
of
it
he
wore
a
white
smock
halfway
to
his
knees
and
over
it
an
sam
browne
belt
which
supported
a
bulky
tablet
and
a
large
stylus
on
the
strap
which
crossed
his

five
or
six
little
metal
badges
twinkled
why
no
other

can
compare
with
delicious
tangy

wo
you
try
it
he
pleaded
then
you
will
see
for
yourself
why

happy

always
call
for

with

the

really
a
camouflaged

for
a
small

bodyguards
of
course
were
discreetly
out
of

of

by
the

snorted
in

toward
the

on
the
left
the
quick
perennially
boyish
smile
followed
by
the
levelly
serious
gaze
into

the
whole
act
might
have
been
a
of
mongery
first
appearance
on
the
video
fifteen
years
ago
at
least
it
was
off
the
same
ear
of
corn
that
big
hunk
of
cheese
ray
commented
for
once
pelton
shush
him
that
was
too
close
to
his
own
attitude
at
least
in
terminology
first
of
all
for
the
country
and
especially
the
newer
new
york
area
and
by
the
way
it
looks
as
though
somebody
thought
somebody
needed
a
little
cooling
off
but
we
come
to
that
later
here
the
forecast
today
and
tomorrow
the
weather
will
continue
fine
warm
in
the
sun
chilly
in
the
shadows
there
wo
be
anything
to
keep
you
from
the
polls
tomorrow
except
or
a
last
chance
at
a
game
of
golf
this
is
the
first
time
within
this
commentator
memory
that
the
weather
has
definitely
been
in
favor
of
the
party
out
of
power
on
the
world
scene
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
survivors
of
the
wrecked
have
all
been
rescued
from
the
top
of
mount
everest
after
a
difficult
and
heroic
effort
by
the
royal
nepalese
air
force
the
results
of
last
week
election
in
russia
are
being
challenged
by
twelve
of
the
fourteen
parties
represented
on
the
ballot
the
only
parties
not
hurling
accusations
of
fraud
are
the
democrats
who
won
and
the
christian
communists
who
are
about
as
influential
in
russian
politics
as
the
party
is
here
the
central
diplomatic
council
of
the
reunited
nations
has
just
announced
for
the
hundred
and
time
that
the
dispute
has
been
finally
definitely
and
satisfactorily
settled
this
morning
reports
from
baghdad
and
tel
aviv
only
list
four
arabs
and
six
israelis
killed
in
border
clashes
in
the
past
hours
so
maybe
they
really
getting
things
patched
up
after
all
during
the
same
period
there
were
more
fatalities
in
newer
new
york
as
a
result
of
clashes
between
the
private
troops
of
rival
racket
gangs
political
parties
and
business
houses
which
brings
us
to
the
local
scene
on
my
way
to
the
studio
this
morning
i
stopped
at
city
hall
and
found
our
genial
chief
of
police
delaney
delaney
to
most
of
us
hard
at
work
with
a
portable
disintegrator
getting
rid
of
record
disks
and
recording
tapes
of
old
and
cases
he
had
a
couple
of
amusing
stories
for
instance
a
lone
partisan
broke
up
a
mass
meeting
preparatory
to
a
march
to
demonstrate
in
double
times
square
by
applying
his
pocket
lighter
to
one
of
the
boxes
in
the
building
and
activating
the
sprinkler
system
by
the
time
the
radicals
had
gotten
into
dry
clothing
there
was
a
well
sort
of
impromptu
conservative
demonstration
going
on
in
double
times
square
and
one
of
the
few
things
the
local
gendarmes
wo
stand
for
is
an
attempt
to
hold
two
rival
political
meetings
in
the
same
area
curiously
while
it
was
the
radicals
who
got
soaked
it
was
the
conservatives
who
sneezed
mongery
went
on
his
face
glowing
with
mischievous
amusement
it
seems
that
while
they
were
holding
a
monster
rally
at
hague
hall
in
north
jersey
borough
some
person
or
persons
unknown
got
at
the
system
with
a
tank
of
sneeze
gas
which
did
exactly
improve
either
the
speaking
style
of
senator
grant
hamilton
or
the
attentiveness
of
his
audience
needless
to
say
there
is
no
police
investigation
of
either
incident
election
shenanigans
like
college
pranks
are
fair
play
as
long
as
they
cause
an
outright
holocaust
and
that
i
think
is
as
it
should
be
mongery
went
on
more
seriously
most
of
the
horrors
of
the
twentieth
and
centuries
were
the
result
of
taking
politics
too
seriously
pelton
snorted
again
that
was
the
literate
line
all
right
treat
politics
as
a
joke
and
an
election
as
a
sporting
event
let
the
grafters
stay
in
power
and
let
the
literates
run
the
country
through
them
not
of
course
that
he
disapproved
of
those
boys
in
the
young
radical
league
who
thought
up
that
trick
and
now
what
you
been
waiting
for
mongery
continued
the
final
trotter
poll
analysis
a
novice
literate
advanced
handing
him
a
big
book
which
he
opened
with
the
reverence
a
literate
always
displayed
toward
the
written
word
this
he
said
is
going
to
surprise
you
for
the
whole
state
of
the
poll
shows
a
probable
vote
of
approximately
thirty
million
an
vote
of
approximately
ten
and
a
half
million
and
a
vote
of
about
a
million
for
what
we
call
the
party
which
frankly
is
the
party
of
your
commentator
choice
very
few
sections
differ
widely
from
this
average
there
will
be
a
much
heavier
radical
vote
in
the
pittsburgh
area
and
traditionally
conservative
philadelphia
and
the
upper
hudson
valley
will
give
the
radicals
a
much
smaller
majority
they
all
looked
at
one
another
thunderstruck
if
mongery
admitting
that
i
in
pelton
exclaimed
yeah
we
can
start
calling
him
senator
now
and
really
mean
it
ray
said
maybe
old
mongie
is
such
a
bad
sort
of
twerp
after
all
considering
that
the
conservatives
carried
this
state
by
a
substantial
majority
in
the
presidential
election
of
two
years
ago
and
by
a
huge
majority
in
the
previous
presidential
election
of
mongery
in
the
screen
continued
this
verdict
of
the
almost
infallible
trotter
poll
needs
some
explaining
for
the
most
part
it
is
the
result
of
the
untiring
efforts
of
one
man
the
dynamic
new
leader
of
the
and
their
present
candidate
for
the
consolidated
states
of
north
america
senate
chester
pelton
who
has
transformed
that
party
into
the
vital
force
it
is
today
and
this
achievement
has
been
due
very
largely
to
a
single
slogan
which
he
had
hammered
into
your
ears
the
literates
in
their
place
our
servants
not
our
masters
he
brushed
a
hand
deprecatingly
over
his
white
smock
and
fingered
the
badges
on
his
belt
there
has
always
been
on
the
part
of
the
illiterate
public
some
resentment
against
organized
literacy
in
part
it
has
been
due
to
the
high
fees
charged
for
literate
services
and
to
what
seems
to
many
to
be
monopolistic
practices
but
behind
that
is
a
general
attitude
of
which
is
our
heritage
from
the
disastrous
wars
of
the
twentieth
and
centuries
chester
pelton
has
made
himself
the
spokesman
of
this
attitude
in
his
view
it
was
men
who
could
read
and
write
who
hatched
the
diabolical
political
ideologies
and
designed
the
frightful
nuclear
weapons
of
that
period
in
his
mind
literacy
is
equated
with
and
with
the
and
the
with
concentration
camps
and
blasted
cities
from
this
position
of
course
i
beg
politely
to
differ
literate
men
also
gave
us
the
magna
charta
and
the
declaration
of
independence
now
in
spite
of
a
lunatic
fringe
in
the
consolidated
organization
who
want
just
that
chester
pelton
knows
that
we
can
not
abolish
literacy
entirely
even
with
modern
recording
need
exists
for
some
modicum
of
written
recording
which
can
be
rapidly
scanned
and
selected
from
indexing
cataloguing
tabulating
data
et
cetera
and
for
at
least
a
few
men
and
women
who
can
form
and
interpret
the
written
word
pelton
himself
is
the
owner
of
a
huge
department
store
employing
over
a
thousand
illiterates
he
must
at
all
times
have
the
services
of
at
least
fifty
literates
and
pays
through
the
nose
for
them
too
pelton
growled
it
was
more
than
fifty
and
russ
latterman
had
been
forced
to
get
twenty
extras
sent
in
for
the
sale
now
since
we
can
not
renounce
literacy
entirely
without
sinking
to
barbarism
and
here
i
definitely
part
company
with
pelton
he
fears
the
potential
power
of
organized
literacy
in
a
word
he
fears
a
future
literate
dictatorship
future
what
do
you
think
we
have
now
pelton
demanded
nobody
mongery
said
as
though
replying
to
him
is
stupid
enough
today
to
want
to
be
a
dictator
that
ended
by
the
middle
of
the
century
everybody
knows
what
happened
to
mussolini
and
hitler
and
stalin
and
all
their
imitators
why
it
is
as
much
the
public
fear
of
big
government
as
the
breakdown
of
civil
power
because
of
the
administrative
handicap
of
a
shortage
of
literate
administrators
that
is
responsible
for
the
disgraceful
lawlessness
of
the
past
hundred
years
thus
it
speaks
well
for
the
public
trust
in
chester
pelton
known
integrity
and
sincerity
that
so
many
of
our
people
are
willing
to
agree
to
his
program
for
socialized
literacy
they
feel
that
he
can
be
trusted
and
violently
as
i
disagree
with
him
i
can
only
say
that
that
trust
is
not
misplaced
of
course
there
is
also
the
question
so
often
raised
by
pelton
that
under
the
hamilton
machine
the
politics
and
particularly
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
in
this
state
are
unbelievably
corrupt
but
i
wonder
mongery
paused
just
a
moment
i
see
a
flash
bulletin
being
brought
in
the
novice
literate
came
to
his
side
and
gave
him
a
slip
of
paper
at
which
he
glanced
then
he
laughed
heartily
it
seems
that
shortly
after
i
began
speaking
the
local
grand
jury
issued
a
summons
for
chief
delaney
to
appear
before
them
with
all
his
records
unfortunately
the
summons
could
not
be
served
chief
delaney
had
just
boarded
a
from
tom
dewey
field
for
buenos
aires
he
cocked
an
eye
at
the
audience
i
know
irish
is
going
to
have
a
nice
time
down
there
in
the
springtime
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
incidentally
the
argentine
is
one
of
the
few
major
powers
which
never
signed
the
world
extradition
convention
of
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
audience
and
now
until
tomorrow
at
breakfast

bottle
elliot
c
mongery
well
whattaya
know
that
guy
was
plugging
for
you
ray
said
and
see
how
he
managed
to
slide
in
that
bit
about
corruption
right
before
his
stooge
handed
him
that
bulletin
i
guess
every
literate
has
his
price
chester
pelton
said
i
wonder
how
much
of
my
money
that
cost
i
always
wondered
why
frank
cardon
sponsored
mongery
now
i
know
mongery
can
be
had
uh
beg
your
pardon
pelton
a
voice
from
the
hall
broke
in
he
turned
olaf
olafsson
the
driver
was
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
breakfast
nook
a
smudge
of
oil
on
his
cheek
and
his
hair
in
disorder
how
do
i
go
about
startin
this
new
what
olaf
had
been
his
driver
for
ten
years
he
would
have
been
less
surprised
had
the
ceiling
fallen
in
you
do
know
how
to
start
it
no
sir
the
controls
is
all
different
from
on
the
summer
model
every
time
i
try
to
raise
it
it
backs
up
if
i
try
to
raise
it
much
more
we
wo
have
no
wall
left
on
the
landing
stage
well
is
there
a
book
there
ai
no
pictures
in
it
nothing
but
print
it
a
literate
book
olaf
said
in
disgust
as
though
at
something
obscene
there
ai
nothin
on
the
instrument
board
but
letters
that
right
ray
agreed
i
saw
the
book
no
pictures
in
it
at
all
well
of
all
the
stupidity
the
confounded
imbeciles
at
that
agency
pelton
started
to
his
feet
claire
unlocked
the
table
and
slid
it
out
of
his
way
ray
on
a
run
started
for
the
lift
and
vanished
i
think
some
confounded
literate
at
the
agency
did
that
he
fumed
thought
it
would
be
a
joke
to
send
me
a
literate
instruction
book
along
with
a
with
a
literate
instrument
board
ah
i
get
it
so
i
have
to
call
in
a
literate
to
show
me
how
to
start
my
own
and
by
noon
they
be
laughing
about
it
in
every
bar
from
pittsburgh
to
plattsburg
sneaky
literate
trick
they
went
to
the
lift
and
found
the
door
closed
in
their
faces
oh
confound
that
boy
claire
pressed
the
button
ray
must
have
left
the
lift
for
the
operating
light
went
on
and
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
he
crowded
into
the
lift
along
with
his
daughter
and
olaf
on
the
landing
stage
ray
was
already
in
the
poking
at
buttons
on
the
board
look
olaf
he
called
they
just
shifted
them
around
a
little
from
the
summer
model
this
one
where
the
used
to
be
on
the
old
model
is
the
one
that
backs
it
up
on
the
ground
here
the
one
that
erects
and
extends
the
prop
he
pushed
it
and
the
prop
snapped
obediently
into
place
and
here
the
one
that
controls
the
lift
an
ugly
suspicion
stabbed
at
chester
pelton
bringing
with
it
a
feeling
of
frightened
horror
how
do
you
know
he
demanded
ray
eyes
remained
on
the
instrument
board
he
pushed
another
button
and
the
propeller
began
swinging
in
a
lazy
circle
he
pressed
down
with
his
right
foot
and
the
lifted
a
foot
or
so
what
he
asked
oh
jimmy
showed
me
how
theirs
works
hartnett
got
one
like
it
a
week
ago
he
motioned
to
olaf
setting
the
down
again
come
here
i
show
you
the
suspicion
and
the
horror
passed
in
a
wave
of
relief
you
think
you
and
olaf
between
you
can
get
that
thing
to
school
he
asked
sure
easy
all
right
you
show
olaf
how
to
run
it
olaf
as
soon
as
dropped
ray
at
school
take
that
thing
to
the
agency
and
get
a
new
one
with
a
proper
instrument
board
and
a
proper
picture
book
of
operating
instructions
i
going
to
call
sam
huschack
up
personally
and
give
him
royal
hell
about
this
sure
you
can
handle
it
now
he
watched
the
rise
to
the
two
thousand
foot
local
traffic
level
and
turn
in
the
direction
of
mineola
high
school
fifty
miles
away
he
was
still
looking
anxiously
after
it
as
it
dwindled
to
a
tiny
dot
and
vanished
they
make
it
all
right
claire
told
him
olaf
has
a
strong
back
and
ray
has
a
good
head
it
was
that
that
i
was
worried
about
he
turned
and
looked
half
ashamed
at
his
daughter
you
know
for
a
minute
there
i
thought
i
thought
ray
could
read
father
she
was
so
shocked
that
she
forgot
the
nickname
they
had
given
him
when
he
had
announced
his
candidacy
for
senate
in
the
spring
you
did
i
know
it
an
awful
thing
to
think
but
well
the
kids
today
do
the
craziest
things
there
that
hartnett
boy
he
runs
around
with
tom
hartnett
bought
literate
training
for
him
and
that
fellow
prestonby
i
do
trust
him
prestonby
claire
asked
puzzled
oh
you
know
the
principal
at
school
you
met
him
claire
wrinkled
her
brow
just
like
her
mother
when
she
was
trying
to
remember
something
oh
yes
i
met
him
at
that
meeting
he
did
impress
me
as
being
much
like
a
teacher
but
i
suppose
they
think
anything
good
enough
for
us
illiterates
literate
first
class
ralph
prestonby
remained
standing
by
the
lectern
looking
out
over
the
crowded
auditorium
still
pleasantly
surprised
to
estimate
the
day
attendance
at
something
like
per
cent
of
enrollment
that
was
really
good
why
it
was
only
three
per
cent
short
of
perfect
maybe
it
was
the
new
rule
requiring
a
excuse
for
absence
or
it
could
have
been
his
propaganda
campaign
about
the
benefits
of
education
or
very
easily
it
could
have
been
the
result
of
sending
doug
yetsko
and
some
of
his
boys
around
to
talk
to
recalcitrant
parents
it
was
good
to
see
that
that
was
having
some
effect
beside
an
increase
in
the
number
of
attempts
on
his
life
or
the
flood
of
complaints
to
the
board
of
education
well
lancedale
had
gotten
education
merged
with
his
office
of
communications
and
lancedale
was
back
of
him
to
the
limit
so
the
complaints
had
died
out
on
the
empty
air
and
doug
yetsko
was
his
bodyguard
so
most
of
the
assassins
had
died
also
the
north
american
anthem
which
had
replaced
the
banner
after
the
united
merger
came
to
an
end
the
students
and
their
teachers
below
relaxed
from
attention
most
of
them
sat
down
while
monitors
and
teachers
in
the
rear
were
getting
the
students
into
the
aisles
and
marching
them
off
to
study
halls
and
classrooms
and
workshops
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
lively
march
tune
he
leaned
his
left
elbow
literates
learned
early
or
did
not
live
to
learn
not
to
immobilize
the
right
hand
on
the
lectern
and
watched
the
interminable
business
of
getting
the
students
marched
out
yearning
as
he
always
did
at
this
time
for
the
privacy
of
his
office
where
he
could
smoke
his
pipe
finally
they
were
all
gone
and
the
orchestra
had
gathered
up
its
instruments
and
filed
out
into
the
wings
of
the
stage
and
he
looked
up
to
the
left
and
said
softly
all
right
doug
show
over
with
a
soft
thud
the
big
man
dropped
down
from
the
guard
cubicle
overhead
grinning
cheerfully
he
needed
a
shave
yetsko
always
did
in
the
mornings
and
in
his
leather
literates
guard
uniform
he
looked
like
some
ogreish
giant
out
of
the
mythology
of
the
past
illustration
i
was
glad
to
have
you
up
there
with
the
big
noise
this
morning
prestonby
said
what
a
mob
i
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
we
have
such
an
attendance
do
you
get
it
captain
yetsko
was
reaching
up
to
lock
the
door
of
his
cubicle
he
seemed
surprised
at
prestonby
obtuseness
day
before
election
the
little
darlings
moms
and
pops
do
want
them
out
running
around
we
can
look
for
another
big
crowd
tomorrow
too
prestonby
gave
a
snort
of
disgust
of
course
how
imbecilic
can
i
really
get
i
did
notice
any
of
them
falling
down
so
i
suppose
you
did
see
anything
out
of
line
well
the
hall
monitors
make
them
turn
in
their
little
playthings
at
the
doors
yetsko
said
but
hall
monitors
can
be
gotten
at
and
some
of
the
stuff
they
make
in
manual
training
when
nobody
watching
them
prestonby
nodded
just
a
week
before
a
crude
but
perfectly
operative
shotgun
had
been
discovered
in
the
last
stages
of
manufacture
in
the
machine
shop
and
five
out
of
six
of
the
files
would
vanish
to
be
ground
down
into
dirks
he
often
thought
of
the
stories
of
his
grandfather
who
had
been
a
major
during
the
occupation
of
russia
after
the
fourth
world
war
those
did
know
how
easy
they
had
it
they
should
have
tried
to
run
an
illiterate
high
school
yetsko
was
still
grumbling
slanders
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
student
body
one
of
those
little
angels
shoots
me
it
just
a
cute
little
prank
and
we
ought
to
frown
on
the
little
darling
when
it
just
trying
to
express
its
dear
little
personality
or
we
might
give
it
complexes
or
something
he
falsettoed
incongruously
and
if
the
little
darling
mistake
does
kill
me
outright
and
i
shoot
back
people
talk
about
king
herod
he
used
language
about
the
board
of
education
and
the
public
that
was
probably
subversive
within
the
meaning
of
the
loyalty
oath
i
wish
i
had
a
pair
of
up
there
instead
of
that
sono
gun
each
class
is
a
little
worse
than
the
one
before
in
about
five
years
they
be
making
in
the
lab
prestonby
said
in
the
last
week
a
dozen
pupils
had
been
seriously
cut
or
blackjacked
in
hall
and
fights
nice
citizens
of
the
future
nice
future
to
look
forward
to
growing
old
in
we
wo
yetsko
comforted
him
we
ca
be
lucky
all
the
time
in
about
a
year
they
find
both
of
us
stuffed
into
a
broom
closet
when
they
start
looking
around
to
see
what
making
all
the
stink
prestonby
took
the
gas
pistol
from
the
shelf
under
the
lectern
and
shoved
it
into
his
hip
pocket
yetsko
picked
up
a
foot
length
of
rubber
hose
and
tucked
it
under
his
left
arm
together
they
went
back
through
the
wings
and
out
into
the
hallway
that
led
to
the
office
so
a
century
high
school
was
a
place
where
a
teacher
carried
a
pistol
and
a
projector
and
a
gun
and
had
a
bodyguard
and
still
walked
in
danger
of
his
life
from
armed
hooligans
it
was
meaningless
to
ask
whose
fault
it
was
there
had
been
the
world
wars
and
the
interbellum
periods
rising
birth
rates
huge
demands
on
the
public
treasury
for
armaments
with
the
public
taxed
to
the
saturation
point
and
no
money
left
for
the
schools
there
had
been
fantastic
progressive
education
experiments
even
in
the
of
the
twentieth
century
in
the
big
cities
children
were
being
pushed
through
grade
school
without
having
learned
to
read
and
when
there
had
been
money
available
for
education
school
boards
had
insisted
on
spending
it
for
equipment
recordings
films
anything
but
textbooks
and
there
had
been
that
lunatic
theory
that
children
should
be
taught
to
read
by
recognizing
whole
words
instead
of
learning
the
alphabet
and
more
and
more
illiterates
had
been
shoved
out
of
the
schools
into
a
world
where
radio
and
television
and
moving
pictures
were
supplanting
books
and
newspapers
and
more
and
more
children
of
illiterates
had
gone
to
school
without
any
desire
or
incentive
to
learn
to
read
and
finally
the
illiterates
had
become
illiterates
and
literacy
had
become
literacy
and
now
the
associated
fraternities
of
literates
had
come
to
monopolize
the
ability
to
read
and
write
and
a
few
men
like
william
lancedale
with
a
handful
of
followers
like
ralph
prestonby
were
trying
the
gleaming
cleanliness
of
the
corridor
as
always
heartened
prestonby
a
little
it
was
a
trophy
of
victory
from
his
first
two
days
at
mineola
high
school
three
years
ago
he
remembered
what
they
had
looked
like
when
he
had
first
seen
them
this
school
is
a
pig
pen
he
had
barked
at
the
janitorial
force
and
even
if
they
are
illiterates
these
children
are
pigs
they
deserve
decent
surroundings
this
school
will
be
cleaned
immediately
from
top
to
bottom
and
it
be
kept
that
way
the
janitors
all
political
appointees
secure
in
their
jobs
had
laughed
derisively
the
building
superintendent
without
troubling
to
rise
had
answered
him
young
man
you
do
want
to
get
off
on
the
wrong
foot
here
he
had
said
this
here
the
way
this
school
always
been
run
an
gon
na
take
a
lot
more
than
you
to
change
it
the
fellow
name
he
recalled
was
kettner
lancedale
had
given
him
a
briefing
which
had
included
some
particulars
about
him
he
was
an
he
had
gotten
his
present
job
after
being
fired
from
his
former
position
as
mailman
for
listening
to
other
peoples
mail
with
his
pocket
yetsko
he
had
said
kick
this
bum
out
on
his
face
you
ca
get
away
with
kettner
had
begun
yetsko
had
yanked
him
out
of
his
chair
with
one
hand
and
started
for
the
door
with
him
just
a
moment
yetsko
he
had
said
thinking
that
he
was
backing
down
they
had
all
begun
grinning
at
him
do
bother
opening
the
door
he
had
said
just
kick
him
out
after
the
third
kick
kettner
had
gotten
the
door
open
himself
the
fourth
kick
sent
him
across
the
hall
to
the
opposite
wall
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
limped
away
never
to
return
the
next
morning
the
school
was
spotless
it
had
stayed
that
way
beside
him
yetsko
must
also
have
returned
mentally
to
the
past
looks
better
now
than
it
did
when
we
first
saw
it
captain
he
said
yes
it
did
take
us
as
long
to
clean
up
this
mess
as
it
did
to
clean
up
that
mutinous
guards
company
in
pittsburgh
but
when
we
cleaned
that
up
it
stayed
cleaned
this
is
like
trying
to
bail
out
a
boat
with
a
pitchfork
yeah
i
wish
stayed
in
pittsburgh
captain
i
wish
we
never
seen
this
place
so
do
i
prestonby
agreed
heartily
no
he
did
either
if
he
never
have
come
to
mineola
high
school
he
never
have
found
claire
pelton
sitting
down
again
at
the
breakfast
table
with
her
father
claire
levered
another
cigarette
out
of
the
readilit
and
puffed
at
it
with
exaggeratedly
bored
slowness
she
was
still
frightened
ray
have
done
what
he
did
even
if
he
had
furnished
a
plausible
explanation
the
trouble
with
plausible
explanations
was
having
to
make
them
sooner
or
later
you
made
too
many
and
then
you
made
one
that
was
so
plausible
and
then
all
the
others
were
remembered
and
they
all
looked
phony
and
why
had
the
senator
had
to
mention
ralph
was
he
beginning
to
suspect
the
truth
about
that
too
i
hope
not
she
thought
desperately
if
he
ever
found
out
about
that
it
kill
him
just
kill
him
period
harris
must
have
turned
off
the
video
after
they
had
gone
up
to
the
landing
stage
to
cover
her
nervousness
she
reached
up
and
snapped
it
on
again
the
screen
lit
and
from
it
a
young
man
with
dark
eyes
under
bushy
black
brows
was
shouting
angrily
most
obvious
sort
of
conspiracy
if
the
party
leaders
or
the
consolidated
illiterates
organization
political
action
committee
need
any
further
evidence
of
the
character
of
their
candidate
and
idolized
leader
chester
pelton
the
treatment
given
to
pelton
candidacy
by
literate
first
class
elliot
mongery
this
morning
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
remove
the
scales
from
the
eyes
of
the
blindest
of
them
i
wo
state
in
so
many
words
that
chester
pelton
sold
out
the
and
the
consolidated
illiterates
organization
to
the
associated
fraternities
of
literates
because
since
no
witness
to
any
actual
transfer
of
money
can
be
found
such
a
statement
would
be
libelous
provided
pelton
had
nerve
enough
to
sue
me
why
you
dirty
misbegotten
illegitimate
pelton
was
on
his
feet
his
hand
went
to
his
hip
and
then
realizing
that
he
was
unarmed
and
in
any
case
confronted
only
by
an
electronic
image
he
sat
down
again
pelton
been
yapping
for
socialized
literacy
the
man
on
the
screen
continued
i
not
going
back
to
the
old
argument
that
any
kind
of
socialization
is
only
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
which
will
pry
open
the
pit
of
horrors
from
which
the
world
has
climbed
since
the
fourth
world
war
if
you
do
realize
that
now
it
no
use
for
me
to
repeat
it
again
but
i
will
ask
you
do
you
realize
for
a
moment
what
a
program
of
socialized
literacy
would
mean
apart
from
the
implications
of
any
kind
of
socialization
it
would
mean
that
inside
of
five
years
the
literates
would
control
the
whole
government
they
control
the
courts
now
only
a
literate
can
become
a
lawyer
and
only
a
lawyer
can
become
a
judge
they
control
the
armed
forces
only
a
literate
can
enter
west
point
or
fort
mackenzie
or
chapultepec
or
white
sands
or
annapolis
and
if
chester
pelton
socialization
scheme
goes
into
effect
there
will
be
no
branch
of
the
government
which
will
not
be
completely
under
the
control
of
the
associated
fraternities
of
literates
the
screen
went
suddenly
dark
her
father
turned
to
catch
her
with
her
hand
still
on
the
switch
put
it
back
on
i
want
to
hear
what
that
lying
pimp
of
a
slade
gardner
saying
about
me
phooy
you
have
shot
it
out
yourself
if
you
had
your
gun
on
i
saw
you
reaching
for
it
now
be
quiet
and
take
it
easy
she
ordered
he
reached
toward
the
readilit
for
a
cigarette
then
his
hand
stopped
his
face
was
contorted
with
pain
he
gave
a
gasp
of
suffocation
claire
cried
in
dismay
you
not
going
to
have
another
of
those
attacks
where
are
the
nitrocaine
bulbs
do
have
any
here
some
at
the
office
but
i
told
you
to
get
more
she
accused
oh
i
do
need
them
really
his
voice
was
steadier
now
the
spasm
of
pain
had
passed
he
filled
his
coffee
cup
and
sipped
from
it
turn
on
the
video
again
claire
i
want
to
hear
what
that
saying
i
will
not
do
you
have
people
at
party
headquarters
monitoring
this
stuff
well
then
somebody
prepare
an
answer
if
he
needs
answering
i
think
he
does
a
lot
of
these
dumbos
hear
that
and
believe
it
i
talk
to
frank
he
know
what
to
do
frank
again
she
frowned
look
senator
you
think
frank
cardon
your
friend
but
i
trust
him
i
never
could
she
said
i
think
he
utterly
and
entirely
unscrupulous
amoral
i
believe
is
the
word
like
a
savage
or
a
pirate
or
one
of
the
nazis
or
communists
oh
claire
her
father
protested
frank
in
a
tough
business
you
have
no
idea
the
lengths
competition
goes
to
in
the
beer
business
and
he
been
in
politics
and
dealing
with
racketeers
and
labor
unions
all
his
life
but
he
a
good
sound
illiterate
family
illiterate
for
four
generations
like
ours
and
i
trust
him
with
anything
you
heard
this
fellow
mongery
i
always
have
to
pause
to
keep
from
calling
him
mongrel
saying
that
i
deserved
the
credit
for
pulling
the
radicals
out
of
the
mud
and
getting
the
party
back
on
the
tracks
well
i
could
have
begun
to
do
it
without
frank
cardon
frank
cardon
stood
on
the
sidewalk
looking
approvingly
into
the
window
of
tavern
in
which
his
display
crew
had
already
set
up
the
spread
for
the
current
week
on
either
side
was
a
giant
replica
in
black
glass
of
the
cardon
bottle
in
the
conventional
shape
accepted
by
an
illiterate
public
as
containing
beer
bearing
the
red
cardon
label
with
its
pictured
bottle
in
a
central
white
disk
because
of
the
heroic
size
of
the
bottles
the
pictured
bottle
on
the
label
bore
a
bottle
bearing
a
label
bearing
a
bottle
bearing
a
bottle
on
a
label
he
counted
eight
pictured
bottles
down
to
the
tiniest
dot
of
black
there
were
bottles
next
to
the
bottles
and
bottles
next
to
them
and
in
the
middle
background
a
picture
of
an
almost
nude
and
incredibly
pulchritudinous
young
lady
smiling
in
invitation
at
the
passing
throng
and
extending
a
foaming
bottle
of
cardon
in
her
hand
aside
from
the
printed
statements
on
the
labels
there
was
not
a
printed
word
visible
in
the
window
he
pushed
through
the
swinging
doors
and
looked
down
the
long
room
with
the
chairs
still
roosting
sleepily
on
the
tables
and
made
a
quick
count
of
the
early
drinkers
two
thirds
of
them
in
white
smocks
and
sam
browne
belts
obviously
from
literates
hall
across
the
street
late
drinkers
he
corrected
himself
mentally
they
be
the
night
shift
having
their
drinks
before
going
home
good
morning
cardon
the
bartender
greeted
him
still
drinking
your
own
has
poisoned
me
yet
cardon
told
him
or
anybody
else
he
folded
a
and
set
it
on
edge
on
the
bar
give
everybody
what
they
want
drink
up
gentlemen
and
have
one
on
cardon
the
bartender
announced
then
lowered
his
voice
wants
to
see
you
about
he
gave
a
barely
perceptible
nod
in
the
direction
of
the
building
across
the
street
yes
i
want
to
see
him
too
cardon
poured
from
the
bottle
in
front
of
him
accepted
the
thanks
of
the
house
and
when
the
bartender
brought
the
change
from
the
dozen
drinks
he
pushed
it
back
he
drank
slowly
looking
around
the
room
then
set
down
his
empty
glass
and
went
back
past
two
doors
which
bore
pictured
revealing
respectively
and
ankles
and
opened
the
unmarked
office
door
beyond
the
bartender
he
knew
had
pushed
the
signal
button
the
door
was
unlocked
and
inside
baptismal
name
luigi
orelli
was
waiting
chief
wants
to
see
you
right
away
the
saloon
keeper
said
the
brewer
nodded
all
right
keep
me
covered
do
know
how
long
i
be
he
crossed
the
room
and
opened
a
stepping
inside
the
corner
cupboard
which
was
an
elevator
took
him
to
a
tunnel
below
the
street
across
the
street
he
entered
another
elevator
set
the
indicator
for
the
tenth
floor
and
ascended
as
the
car
rose
he
could
feel
the
personality
of
frank
cardon
illiterate
brewer
drop
from
him
as
though
he
were
an
actor
returning
from
the
stage
to
his
dressing
room
the
room
into
which
he
emerged
was
almost
that
there
was
a
long
table
at
which
two
literates
drank
coffee
and
went
over
some
papers
a
third
literate
sprawled
in
a
deep
chair
resting
at
a
small
table
four
men
in
black
shirts
and
leather
breeches
and
field
boots
played
poker
while
a
fifth
who
had
just
entered
and
had
not
yet
removed
his
leather
helmet
and
jacket
or
his
weapons
belt
stood
watching
them
cardon
went
to
a
row
of
lockers
along
the
wall
opened
one
and
took
out
a
white
smock
pulling
it
over
his
head
and
zipping
it
up
to
the
throat
then
he
buckled
on
a
sam
browne
with
its
tablet
holster
and
stylus
gas
projector
the
literate
sprawling
in
the
chair
opened
one
eye
hi
frank
feels
good
to
have
them
on
again
does
it
yes
clean
cardon
replied
it
be
just
for
half
an
hour
but
he
passed
through
the
door
across
from
the
elevator
went
down
a
short
hall
and
spoke
in
greeting
to
the
storm
trooper
on
guard
outside
the
door
at
the
other
end
cardon
the
guard
nodded
lancedale
expecting
you
so
i
understand
bert
he
opened
the
door
and
went
through
william
lancedale
rose
from
behind
his
desk
and
advanced
to
greet
him
with
a
quick
handshake
guiding
him
to
a
chair
beside
the
desk
as
he
did
he
sniffed
and
raised
an
eyebrow
beer
this
early
frank
he
asked
morning
noon
and
night
chief
cardon
replied
when
you
said
this
job
was
going
to
be
dangerous
i
did
know
you
meant
that
it
would
lead
straight
to
an
alcoholic
grave
let
me
get
you
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
cigar
then
the
literate
executive
resumed
his
seat
passing
a
hand
back
and
forth
slowly
across
the
face
of
the
commo
the
diamond
on
his
finger
twinkling
and
gave
brief
instructions
and
just
relax
for
a
minute
you
have
a
tough
job
this
time
frank
they
were
both
silent
as
a
novice
literate
bustled
in
with
coffee
and
cigars
at
least
you
not
one
of
these
fanatics
like
wilton
joyner
and
harvey
graves
cardon
said
on
top
of
everything
else
that
i
could
not
take
lancedale
thin
face
broke
into
a
smile
little
wrinkles
putting
his
mouth
in
parentheses
cardon
sampled
the
coffee
and
then
used
a
sixteenth
century
italian
stiletto
from
lancedale
desk
to
perforate
the
end
of
his
cigar
much
as
i
hate
it
i
have
to
get
out
of
here
as
soon
as
i
can
he
said
i
do
know
how
long
can
keep
me
covered
down
at
the
tavern
lancedale
nodded
well
how
are
things
going
then
first
of
all
the
brewery
cardon
began
lancedale
consigned
the
brewery
to
perdition
that
just
your
cover
any
money
it
makes
is
purely
irrelevant
how
about
the
election
pelton
in
cardon
said
as
nearly
in
as
any
candidate
ever
was
before
the
polls
opened
three
months
ago
the
independents
were
as
solid
as
gibraltar
used
to
be
today
they
look
like
gibraltar
after
that
hit
it
the
only
difference
is
they
do
know
what
hit
them
yet
hamilton
campaign
manager
does
lancedale
said
did
you
hear
his
telecast
this
morning
cardon
shook
his
head
lancedale
handed
over
a
little
record
disk
all
you
need
is
the
first
three
or
four
minutes
he
said
the
rest
of
it
is
repetition
cardon
put
the
disk
in
his
pocket
recorder
and
set
it
for
putting
the
plug
in
his
ear
after
a
while
he
shut
it
off
and
took
out
the
ear
plug
that
bad
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
lancedale
shrugged
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
countered
pelton
campaign
manager
heaven
pity
him
cardon
thought
for
a
moment
we
play
it
for
laughs
he
decided
some
of
our
semantics
experts
could
make
the
joke
of
the
year
out
of
it
by
the
time
the
polls
open
tomorrow
the
fraternities
bribing
their
worst
enemy
to
attack
them
so
that
he
can
ruin
their
business
who
been
listening
to
a
tape
of
in
wonderland
at
headquarters
that
would
work
lancedale
agreed
and
we
can
count
on
our
friends
joyner
and
graves
to
give
you
every
possible
assistance
with
their
customary
tactics
i
suppose
you
seen
these
posters
they
been
plastering
around
you
can
read
this
chester
pelton
is
your
sworn
enemy
a
vote
for
pelton
is
a
vote
for
your
own
enslavement
naturally
and
have
you
seen
the
telecast
we
been
using
a
view
of
it
with
a
semantically
correct
spoken
paraphrase
lancedale
nodded
and
i
also
noticed
that
those
posters
have
been
acquiring
different
obscene
too
that
just
typical
of
the
mentality
why
they
made
more
votes
for
pelton
than
he
made
for
himself
is
it
any
wonder
convinced
that
people
like
that
are
to
be
trusted
to
formulate
the
future
policy
of
the
fraternities
well
they
proved
themselves
wrong
i
wonder
though
if
we
can
prove
ourselves
right
in
the
long
run
there
are
times
when
this
thing
scares
me
chief
if
anything
went
wrong
what
for
instance
somebody
could
get
to
pelton
cardon
made
a
stabbing
gesture
with
the
stiletto
which
he
still
held
maybe
you
do
really
know
how
hot
this
thing
gotten
what
we
had
to
cut
out
of
mongery
report
this
morning
oh
i
been
keeping
in
touch
lancedale
understated
gently
well
then
if
anything
happened
to
pelton
there
would
be
a
literate
left
alive
in
this
city
twelve
hours
later
and
i
question
whether
or
not
graves
and
joyner
know
that
i
think
they
do
if
they
do
it
not
because
i
failed
to
point
it
out
to
them
of
course
there
are
the
grafters
a
lot
of
them
are
beginning
to
hear
jail
doors
opening
for
them
and
they
scared
but
i
think
routine
ought
to
protect
pelton
from
them
or
from
any
isolated
fanatics
and
there
is
also
the
matter
of
pelton
daughter
and
his
son
cardon
said
we
know
and
graves
and
joyner
know
and
i
assume
that
slade
gardner
knows
that
they
can
both
read
and
write
as
well
as
any
literate
in
the
fraternities
suppose
that
got
out
between
now
and
the
election
and
that
could
not
only
hurt
pelton
but
it
would
expose
the
work
we
been
doing
in
the
schools
lancedale
added
and
even
inside
the
fraternities
that
would
raise
the
devil
joyner
and
graves
begin
to
realize
how
far
we
gone
with
that
they
could
kick
up
a
simply
hideous
row
about
it
and
if
pelton
found
out
that
his
kids
are
literates
cardon
grimaced
or
what
we
been
doing
to
him
i
hope
i
not
around
when
that
happens
i
beginning
to
like
the
cantankerous
old
bugger
i
was
afraid
of
that
lancedale
said
well
do
let
it
interfere
with
what
you
have
to
do
remember
frank
the
plan
has
to
come
first
always
he
walked
with
to
the
street
door
talking
about
election
after
shaking
hands
with
the
saloon
keeper
he
crossed
the
sidewalk
and
stepped
onto
the
beltway
moving
across
the
strips
until
he
came
to
the
twenty
strip
the
tall
office
buildings
of
upper
yonkers
borough
marched
away
as
he
stood
on
the
strip
appreciatively
puffing
at
lancedale
cigar
the
character
of
the
street
changed
the
buildings
grew
lower
and
the
quiet
and
fashionable
shops
and
cafés
gave
place
to
bargain
stores
their
whooping
urgently
about
improbable
prices
and
offerings
and
garish
noisy
crowded
bars
and
cafeterias
blaring
recorded
popular
music
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
political
advertising
in
evidence
huge
pictures
of
the
two
major
senatorial
candidates
he
estimated
that
chester
pelton
bald
head
and
bulldog
features
appeared
twice
for
every
one
of
grant
hamilton
white
locks
spectacles
and
smirk
then
he
came
to
the
building
on
which
he
had
parked
his
and
left
the
beltway
entering
and
riding
up
to
the
landing
stage
on
the
helical
escalator
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
trouble
about
a
dozen
storm
troopers
in
their
white
robes
and
hoods
with
the
emblem
on
their
breasts
were
bunched
together
most
of
them
with
their
right
hands
inside
their
bosoms
while
a
similar
group
of
storm
troopers
with
their
black
sombreros
and
little
black
masks
stood
watching
them
and
fingering
the
pistols
they
wore
in
pairs
on
their
belts
between
the
two
groups
were
four
city
policemen
looking
acutely
unhappy
the
group
in
the
lone
ranger
uniforms
he
saw
were
standing
in
front
of
a
huge
animated
portrait
of
chester
pelton
as
he
watched
the
pictured
candidate
raised
a
clenched
fist
and
recorded
and
amplified
voice
thundered
the
literates
in
their
place
our
servants
not
our
masters
he
recognized
the
group
leader
of
the
the
masks
were
too
small
to
be
more
than
token
disguises
and
beckoned
to
him
at
the
same
time
walking
toward
his
the
man
in
black
with
the
pistols
followed
him
spurs
jingling
hello
cardon
he
said
joining
him
nothing
to
it
we
got
a
tip
they
were
coming
to
sabotage
big
brother
over
there
take
out
our
and
put
in
one
of
their
own
like
they
did
over
in
queens
last
week
the
town
clowns
got
here
in
time
to
save
everybody
face
so
there
was
any
shooting
we
staying
put
till
they
go
though
the
literates
in
their
place
our
servants
not
our
masters
the
huge
tridianimate
bellowed
over
in
queens
the
independents
had
managed
to
get
at
a
similar
tridianimate
had
taken
out
the
record
and
had
put
in
one
am
a
lying
fraud
vote
for
grant
hamilton
and
liberty
and
sound
government
smart
work
goodkin
he
approved
do
let
any
of
your
boys
start
the
gunplay
the
city
cops
are
beginning
to
get
wise
to
who
going
to
win
the
election
tomorrow
but
do
antagonize
them
but
if
any
of
those
ku
kluxers
tries
to
pull
a
gun
do
waste
time
trying
to
wing
him
just
hold
on
to
that
fiery
on
his
chest
and
let
him
have
it
and
let
the
coroner
worry
about
him
yeah
with
pleasure
goodkin
replied
you
know
that
nightshirt
thing
they
wear
is
about
the
stupidest
idea
for
a
uniform
i
ever
saw
natural
target
in
a
gunfight
and
in
a
it
gets
them
all
tangled
up
ah
there
go
a
couple
of
coppers
to
talk
to
them
that
what
they
been
waiting
on
now
they
can
beat
it
without
looking
like
they
been
run
out
by
our
gang
cardon
nodded
tell
your
boys
to
stay
around
for
a
while
they
may
expect
you
to
leave
right
after
they
do
and
then
they
try
to
slip
back
you
did
a
good
job
got
here
promptly
be
seeing
you
goodkin
he
climbed
into
his
own
and
started
the
motor
the
literates
in
their
place
the
colossus
roared
triumphantly
after
the
retreating
independents
servants
not
our
masters
at
eight
thousand
he
got
the
onto
the
lower
manhattan
beam
and
relaxed
first
of
all
he
have
to
do
something
about
answering
slade
gardner
telecast
propaganda
that
stuff
was
dangerous
the
answer
ought
to
go
on
the
air
by
noon
and
should
be
stepped
up
through
the
afternoon
first
as
a
straight
news
story
elliot
mongery
had
fifteen
minutes
beginning
at
no
that
would
do
mongery
sponsor
for
that
time
was
atomflame
heaters
and
atomflame
was
a
subsidiary
of
canada
northwest
fissionables
and
canada
northwest
was
in
that
kettle
river
lease
graft
that
pelton
had
sworn
to
get
investigated
as
soon
as
he
took
office
professional
ethics
would
allow
mongery
to
say
anything
in
behalf
on
atomflame
time
well
there
was
guthrie
parham
he
came
on
at
and
his
sponsor
was
all
right
he
call
parham
and
tell
him
what
he
wanted
done
illustration
the
buzzer
warned
him
that
he
was
approaching
the
lower
manhattan
beacon
he
shifted
to
manual
control
dropped
down
to
the
level
and
set
his
selector
beam
for
the
signal
from
pelton
purchasers
paradise
down
toward
the
tip
of
the
island
in
the
section
that
had
been
rebuilt
after
that
stalin
mark
xv
guided
missile
had
gotten
through
the
defenses
in
he
could
see
the
quadrate
cross
of
his
goal
with
public
landing
stages
on
each
of
the
four
arms
and
the
higher
central
block
with
its
landing
stage
for
freight
and
store
personnel
above
the
four
public
stages
helicopters
swarmed
like
may
flies
may
flies
which
had
mutated
and
invented
ritual
or
military
drill
or
choreography
coming
in
in
four
streams
to
the
tips
of
the
arms
and
rising
vertically
from
the
middle
there
was
about
ten
times
the
normal
amount
of
traffic
for
this
early
in
the
morning
he
wondered
briefly
then
remembered
and
cursed
that
infernal
sale
grudgingly
he
respected
russell
latterman
smartness
and
in
consequence
the
ability
of
wilton
joyner
and
harvey
graves
in
selecting
a
good
agent
to
plant
in
pelton
store
latterman
gave
a
plausible
impersonation
of
the
illiterate
businessman
loyal
prime
minister
of
pelton
commercial
empire
generalissimo
in
the
perpetual
war
against
macy
gimbel
from
that
viewpoint
the
sale
was
excellent
business
latterman
had
gotten
the
jump
on
all
the
other
department
stores
for
the
winter
fashions
and
fall
sports
trade
he
had
also
turned
the
store
into
a
madhouse
at
the
exact
time
when
chester
pelton
needed
to
give
all
his
attention
to
the
election
pressing
the
button
that
put
on
his
private
recognition
signal
he
rose
above
the
incoming
customers
and
began
to
drop
toward
the
private
landing
stage
circling
to
get
a
view
of
the
other
four
stages
maybe
the
sale
could
be
turned
to
some
advantage
at
that
a
free
souvenir
with
each
purchase
carrying
a
he
broke
off
peering
down
at
the
landing
stage
above
the
central
block
then
brought
his
swooping
down
rapidly
the
figures
he
had
seen
swarming
up
the
helical
escalator
were
not
wearing
the
ku
klux
robes
of
the
storm
troops
as
he
had
first
feared
they
were
in
literate
smocks
and
among
them
were
the
black
leather
jackets
and
futuristic
helmets
of
their
guards
they
were
led
he
saw
by
stephen
bayne
the
store
chief
literate
with
him
were
his
assistant
literate
third
class
roger
feinberg
and
the
novices
carrying
books
and
briefcases
and
cased
typewriters
and
the
guards
and
every
literate
employed
in
the
store
four
or
five
men
in
ordinarily
business
suits
were
obviously
expostulating
about
something
as
he
landed
and
threw
back
the
transparent
canopy
he
could
hear
a
babel
of
voices
above
which
feinberg
was
crying
unfair
unfair
unfair
to
organized
literacy
he
jumped
out
and
hurried
over
but
you
simply
ca
a
man
in
business
clothes
was
protesting
if
you
do
the
associated
fraternities
be
liable
for
losses
we
incur
you
know
that
bayne
his
thin
face
livid
with
anger
and
also
cardon
noticed
with
what
looked
like
a
couple
of
fresh
bruises
ignored
him
feinberg
broke
off
his
chant
of
unfair
unfair
long
enough
to
answer
a
literate
first
class
has
been
brutally
assaulted
by
the
illiterate
owner
of
this
store
literate
service
for
this
store
is
accordingly
being
discontinued
pending
a
decision
by
the
grand
council
of
the
local
fraternity
cardon
grabbed
the
clad
man
and
dragged
him
to
one
side
what
happened
hutschnecker
he
demanded
they
walking
out
on
us
hutschnecker
told
him
unnecessarily
the
boss
had
a
fight
with
bayne
knocked
him
down
a
couple
of
times
bayne
tried
to
pull
his
tablet
gun
and
i
grabbed
it
away
from
him
and
somebody
else
grabbed
pelton
before
he
could
pull
his
and
a
couple
of
store
cops
got
all
the
other
literates
in
the
office
covered
then
bayne
put
on
the
system
and
began
calling
out
the
literates
yes
but
why
did
pelton
beat
bayne
up
bayne
made
a
pass
at
miss
claire
i
was
there
when
it
happened
she
came
into
the
office
cardon
felt
his
face
tighten
into
a
frown
of
perplexity
that
like
literate
first
class
stephen
bayne
he
made
quite
a
hobby
of
pinching
salesgirls
behind
the
counter
which
was
one
thing
the
daughter
was
quite
another
where
latterman
he
asked
looking
around
down
in
the
office
with
the
others
trying
to
help
pelton
had
another
of
those
heart
attacks
cardon
swore
and
ran
for
the
descending
escalator
running
down
the
rotating
spiral
to
the
executive
floor
and
jumping
off
into
the
gawking
mob
of
illiterate
clerks
crowded
in
the
open
doors
of
office
he
hit
and
shoved
and
elbowed
and
cursed
them
out
of
the
way
and
burst
into
the
big
room
beyond
and
then
for
a
moment
he
was
almost
sorry
he
had
come
pelton
was
slumped
in
his
big
relaxer
chair
his
face
pale
and
twisted
in
pain
his
breath
coming
in
feeble
gasps
his
daughter
was
beside
him
her
blond
head
bent
over
him
russell
latterman
was
standing
to
one
side
watching
intently
for
an
instant
cardon
was
reminded
of
a
tomcat
watching
a
promising
mouse
hole
claire
cardon
exploded
give
him
a
nitrocaine
bulb
why
are
you
all
just
standing
around
claire
turned
there
are
none
she
said
looking
at
him
with
desperate
eyes
the
box
is
empty
he
must
have
used
them
all
he
shot
a
quick
glance
at
latterman
catching
the
sales
manager
before
he
could
erase
a
look
of
triumph
from
his
face
things
began
to
add
up
latterman
of
course
was
the
undercover
man
for
wilton
joyner
and
harvey
graves
and
the
rest
of
the
conservative
faction
at
hall
just
as
he
himself
was
lancedale
agent
obsessed
with
immediate
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
faction
wanted
to
secure
the
of
grant
hamilton
and
the
way
things
had
been
going
in
the
past
two
months
only
chester
pelton
death
could
accomplish
that
latterman
had
probably
thrown
out
nitrocaine
capsules
and
then
put
bayne
up
to
insulting
daughter
knowing
that
a
fit
of
rage
would
bring
on
another
heart
attack
which
could
be
fatal
without
the
medicine
well
send
for
more
the
prescription
in
the
safe
she
said
faintly
the
office
safe
was
locked
and
only
a
literate
could
open
it
the
double
combination
was
neatly
stenciled
on
the
door
the
numbers
spelled
out
as
words
and
the
letters
spelled
in
phonetic
equivalents
all
three
of
them
himself
claire
and
russell
latterman
could
read
them
none
of
them
dared
admit
it
latterman
was
fairly
licking
his
chops
in
anticipation
if
cardon
opened
the
safe
pelton
campaign
manager
stood
convicted
as
a
literate
if
claire
opened
it
the
gaggle
of
illiterate
clerks
in
the
doorway
would
see
and
speedily
spread
the
news
that
the
daughter
of
the
of
literacy
was
herself
able
to
read
maybe
latterman
had
really
intended
his
employer
to
die
maybe
this
was
the
situation
he
had
really
intended
to
contrive
chester
pelton
could
be
allowed
to
die
if
grant
hamilton
were
returned
to
the
senate
the
planning
of
william
lancedale
would
suffer
a
crushing
setback
and
the
public
reaction
would
be
catastrophic
plan
comes
lancedale
had
told
him
he
made
his
decision
and
then
saw
that
he
had
needed
to
make
it
claire
had
straightened
left
her
father
crossed
quickly
to
the
safe
and
was
kneeling
in
front
of
it
her
back
stiff
with
determination
her
fingers
busy
at
the
dials
her
eyes
going
from
them
to
the
printed
combination
and
back
again
she
swung
open
the
door
skimmed
through
the
papers
inside
unerringly
selected
the
prescription
and
rose
here
russ
go
get
it
filled
at
once
she
ordered
and
hurry
oh
no
you
do
cardon
thought
one
chance
is
enough
for
you
russ
he
snatched
the
prescription
from
her
and
turned
to
latterman
i
get
it
he
told
the
sales
manager
you
needed
for
the
sale
stay
on
the
job
here
but
with
the
literates
walked
out
we
ca
cardon
blazed
do
i
have
to
teach
you
your
business
have
a
sample
of
each
item
set
aside
at
the
counter
and
pile
sales
slips
under
it
and
for
unique
items
just
detach
the
tag
and
put
it
with
the
sales
slip
now
get
out
of
here
and
get
cracking
with
it
he
picked
up
the
pistol
that
had
been
taken
from
pelton
when
he
had
tried
to
draw
it
on
bayne
checking
the
chamber
and
setting
the
safety
know
how
to
use
this
he
asked
claire
then
hang
onto
it
and
stay
close
to
your
father
this
was
any
accident
it
was
a
deliberate
attempt
on
his
life
i
have
a
couple
of
store
cops
sent
in
here
see
that
they
stay
with
you
he
gave
her
no
chance
to
argue
pushing
latterman
ahead
of
him
he
drove
through
the
mob
of
clerks
outside
the
door
course
she
can
did
you
see
her
open
the
safe
he
heard
nobody
but
a
literate
then
she
a
literate
herself
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
they
would
have
talked
like
that
if
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
girl
were
pregnant
a
couple
of
centuries
before
that
they
would
have
been
equally
horrified
if
she
had
been
discovered
to
have
been
a
protestant
or
a
catholic
or
whatever
the
locally
unpopular
religion
happened
to
be
by
noon
this
would
be
all
over
coming
on
top
of
slade
gardner
accusations
he
ran
up
the
spiral
escalator
stumbling
and
regaining
his
footing
as
he
left
it
bayne
and
his
striking
literates
were
all
gone
he
saw
a
sergeant
of
pelton
store
police
and
went
toward
him
taking
his
spare
from
his
pocket
here
he
said
handing
it
to
the
sergeant
get
another
officer
and
go
down
to
pelton
office
show
it
to
miss
pelton
and
tell
her
i
sent
you
there
been
an
attempt
on
chester
pelton
life
you
to
stay
with
him
use
your
own
judgment
but
do
let
anybody
and
that
definitely
includes
russell
latterman
get
at
him
if
you
see
anything
suspicious
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
afterwards
what
your
name
sergeant
coccozello
sir
guido
coccozello
all
right
there
be
a
medic
or
a
pharmacist
a
literate
anyhow
with
medicine
for
pelton
he
ask
for
you
by
name
and
mention
me
and
there
be
another
literate
maybe
he
know
your
name
and
use
mine
hurry
now
sergeant
he
jumped
into
his
pulled
forward
the
plexiglass
canopy
and
took
off
vertically
to
ten
thousand
feet
then
orienting
himself
swooped
downward
toward
a
landing
stage
on
the
other
side
of
the
east
river
cutting
across
traffic
levels
with
an
utter
contempt
for
regulations
the
building
on
which
he
landed
was
one
of
the
principal
pharmacies
he
spiraled
down
on
the
escalator
to
the
main
floor
and
went
directly
to
the
literate
in
charge
noticing
that
he
wore
on
his
sam
browne
not
only
the
badges
of
pharmacist
and
graduate
chemist
but
also
that
of
snatching
a
pad
and
pencil
from
a
counter
he
wrote
hastily
private
office
at
once
urgent
and
looking
at
it
the
literate
nodded
in
recognition
of
literacy
over
this
way
sir
he
said
guiding
cardon
to
his
small
cubicle
office
here
cardon
gave
him
the
prescription
nitrocaine
bulbs
for
chester
pelton
he
had
a
serious
heart
attack
he
needs
these
with
all
speed
i
do
suppose
i
need
tell
you
how
many
kinds
of
hell
will
break
loose
if
he
dies
now
and
the
fraternities
are
accused
as
the
illiterates
organization
will
be
sure
to
of
having
had
him
poisoned
who
are
you
the
literate
asked
taking
the
prescription
and
glancing
at
it
that
he
gestured
toward
cardon
black
mexican
jacket
is
exactly
a
white
smock
cardon
had
his
pocket
recorder
in
his
hand
he
held
it
out
pressing
a
concealed
stud
the
insignia
glowed
redly
on
it
for
a
moment
then
vanished
the
uniformed
literate
nodded
fill
this
exactly
better
do
it
yourself
to
make
sure
and
take
it
over
to
pelton
yourself
i
see
you
have
a
badge
ask
for
sergeant
coccozello
and
tell
him
frank
cardon
sent
you
the
literate
who
had
not
recognized
him
before
opened
his
eyes
at
the
name
and
whistled
softly
and
fix
up
a
sedative
to
keep
him
quiet
for
not
less
than
four
nor
more
than
six
hours
let
me
use
your
visiphone
for
a
while
if
you
please
the
man
in
the
literate
smock
nodded
and
hurried
out
cardon
dialed
william
lancedale
private
number
when
lancedale
thin
intense
face
appeared
on
the
screen
he
reported
swiftly
the
way
i
estimate
it
he
finished
latterman
put
bayne
up
to
making
a
pass
at
the
girl
after
having
thrown
out
pelton
nitrocaine
bulbs
probably
told
the
silly
jerk
that
claire
was
pining
away
with
secret
passion
for
him
or
something
maybe
he
wanted
to
kill
pelton
maybe
he
just
wanted
this
to
happen
i
assume
there
no
chance
of
stopping
a
leak
cardon
laughed
with
mirthless
harshness
that
i
take
it
was
rhetorical
yes
of
course
lancedale
face
assumed
the
blank
expression
that
went
with
a
pause
for
semantic
can
you
cover
yourself
for
about
an
hour
certainly
trouble
visits
to
campaign
headquarters
an
appeal
on
pelton
behalf
for
a
new
crew
of
literates
for
the
store
good
enough
come
over
i
think
i
can
see
a
way
to
turn
this
to
advantage
i
going
to
call
for
an
emergency
session
of
the
grand
council
this
afternoon
and
i
want
you
sitting
in
on
it
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
plans
now
he
considered
for
a
moment
too
much
of
a
crowd
at
now
come
the
church
way
breaking
the
connection
cardon
dialed
again
a
girl
face
over
a
literate
third
class
smock
appeared
in
the
screen
a
lovely
golden
voice
chimed
at
him
mineola
high
school
good
morning
sir
good
morning
frank
cardon
here
let
me
talk
at
once
to
your
principal
literate
first
class
prestonby
ralph
prestonby
cleared
his
throat
slipped
a
master
disk
into
the
recording
machine
beside
his
desk
and
pressed
the
start
button
dear
parent
or
guardian
he
began
your
daughter
now
a
student
at
this
school
has
reached
the
age
of
eligibility
for
the
domestic
science
course
entitled
to
win
and
hold
a
husband
statistics
show
that
girls
who
have
completed
this
valuable
course
are
sooner
longer
and
happier
married
than
those
who
have
not
enjoyed
its
advantages
we
recommend
it
most
highly
however
because
of
the
delicate
nature
of
some
of
the
visual
material
used
your
consent
is
required
you
can
attach
such
consent
to
this
disk
by
running
it
for
at
least
ten
seconds
after
the
and
then
switching
from
to
kindly
include
your
full
name
as
well
as
your
daughter
and
place
your
thumbprint
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
disk
very
sincerely
yours
literate
first
class
ralph
prestonby
principal
he
put
the
master
disk
in
an
envelope
checked
over
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
of
parents
and
girl
students
and
put
that
in
also
he
looked
over
the
winter
sports
schedule
and
signed
and
thumbprinted
it
then
he
loaded
the
recorder
with
his
morning
mail
switched
to
play
and
started
it
as
he
listened
he
blew
smoke
rings
across
the
room
and
toyed
with
a
dagger
made
from
a
file
which
had
been
thrown
down
the
central
at
him
a
few
days
before
the
invention
of
the
pocket
recorder
which
put
a
conversation
on
a
disk
had
done
more
to
slow
down
business
and
promote
inane
correspondence
than
anything
since
the
earlier
inventions
of
shorthand
typewriters
and
pretty
stenographers
finally
he
cleared
the
machine
dumping
the
whole
mess
into
a
basket
and
carrying
it
out
to
his
secretary
miss
collins
take
this
infernal
rubbish
and
have
a
couple
of
the
girls
divide
it
between
them
play
it
off
and
make
a
digest
of
it
he
said
and
here
the
sports
schedule
and
this
thing
on
the
course
have
them
taken
care
of
this
stuff
martha
collins
said
poking
at
the
pile
of
letter
disks
i
suppose
about
half
of
it
is
threats
abuse
and
obscenities
and
the
other
half
is
from
bores
with
idiotic
suggestions
and
gripes
i
use
that
old
tag
line
again
you
appreciate
our
brevity
as
much
as
we
enjoyed
yours
yes
that
be
all
right
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
going
to
make
a
personal
instead
of
using
the
tv
the
animals
are
sort
of
restless
today
the
election
the
infantile
compulsion
to
take
sides
if
you
need
me
for
anything
urgent
do
use
oral
call
just
flash
my
signal
on
the
hall
and
classroom
screens
oh
doug
yetsko
his
length
of
rubber
hose
under
his
arm
ambled
out
of
prestonby
private
office
stopping
to
stub
out
his
cigarette
the
action
reminded
prestonby
that
he
still
had
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
knocked
it
out
and
pocketed
it
together
they
went
into
the
hall
outside
where
to
first
captain
yetsko
wanted
to
know
department
on
the
top
floor
then
we
drop
down
to
the
shops
and
then
up
through
domestic
science
and
business
and
general
arts
and
back
here
we
hope
yetsko
finished
they
took
a
service
elevator
to
the
top
floor
emerging
into
a
stockroom
piled
with
boxes
and
crates
and
cases
of
sound
records
and
cans
of
film
and
stacks
of
picture
cards
and
all
the
other
impedimenta
of
illiterate
education
passing
through
it
to
the
other
end
prestonby
unlocked
a
door
and
they
went
down
a
short
hall
to
where
ten
or
fifteen
boys
and
girls
had
just
gotten
off
a
helical
escalator
and
were
queued
up
at
a
door
at
the
other
end
there
were
two
literate
guards
in
black
leather
and
a
with
his
white
belt
and
rubber
truncheon
outside
the
door
prestonby
swore
under
his
breath
he
hoped
they
miss
this
but
since
they
had
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
fall
in
at
the
tail
of
the
queue
one
by
one
the
boys
and
girls
went
up
spoke
briefly
to
the
guards
and
the
and
were
passed
through
the
door
each
time
one
of
the
guards
had
to
open
it
with
a
key
finally
it
was
prestonby

he
recited
to
the
guardians
of
the
door
a

the
monitor
replied
solemnly
the
inkwell
is
dry
and
the
book
is
dusty
but
tomorrow
there
will
be
writing
and
reading
for
all
prestonby
answered
the
guard
with
the
key
unlocked
the
door
and
he
and
yetsko
went
through
into
an
utterly
silent
room
and
from
it
into
an
inner
noisy
room
where
a
recorded
voice
was
chanting
hat
box
gun
girl
while
pictures
were
flashed
on
a
screen
at
the
front
and
words
appeared
under
them
there
were
about
twenty
boys
and
girls
of
the
at
facing
the
screen
they
started
learning
the
alphabet
when
school
had
opened
in
september
now
they
had
gotten
as
far
as
combining
letters
into
simple
words
in
another
month
they
be
as
far
as
diphthongs
and
would
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
silent
letters
maybe
sooner
than
that
he
was
finding
that
children
who
had
not
been
taught
to
read
until
their
twelfth
year
learned
much
more
rapidly
than
the
primary
grade
children
in
the
literate
schools
what
he
was
doing
here
was
exactly
illegal
it
was
even
against
the
strict
letter
of
fraternity
regulations
but
it
had
to
be
done
clandestinely
what
he
have
liked
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
have
given
every
boy
and
girl
in
english
i
the
same
instruction
this
selected
group
was
getting
but
that
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
the
public
would
never
have
stood
for
it
the
police
would
have
had
to
intervene
to
prevent
a
riotous
mob
of
illiterates
from
tearing
the
school
down
brick
by
brick
and
even
if
that
happen
the
ensuing
uproar
inside
the
fraternity
would
have
blown
the
roof
off
literates
hall
even
lancedale
could
have
survived
such
an
explosion
and
the
body
of
literate
first
class
ralph
prestonby
would
have
been
found
in
a
vacant
lot
the
next
morning
even
many
of
lancedale
supporters
would
have
turned
on
him
in
anger
at
this
sudden
blow
to
the
fraternities
monopoly
of
the
printed
word
so
it
had
to
be
kept
secret
and
since
adolescents
in
possession
of
a
secret
are
under
constant
temptation
to
hint
mysteriously
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
this
of
ritual
and
password
and
countersign
had
to
be
resorted
to
he
been
in
conspiratorial
work
of
other
kinds
and
knew
that
there
was
a
sound
psychological
basis
for
most
of
what
seemed
at
first
glance
to
be
mere
melodramatic
claptrap
he
and
yetsko
passed
on
through
a
door
across
the
room
into
another
room
the
work
of
soundproofing
and
partitioning
the
old
stockroom
had
been
done
in
the
last
semester
of
his
first
year
at
mineola
high
by
members
of
the
graduating
class
of
students
who
had
then
gone
their
several
ways
convinced
that
they
had
been
working
on
a
set
of
practice
rooms
the
board
of
education
had
never
even
found
out
about
it
in
this
second
room
a
literate
teacher
one
of
the
lancedale
faction
had
a
reading
class
of
or
thirty
a
girl
was
on
her
feet
with
a
book
in
her
hand
reading
from
it
we
are
not
sure
of
sorrow
and
joy
was
never
sure
today
will
die
tomorrow
time
stoops
to
no
man
lure
and
love
grown
faint
and
fretful
with
lips
but
half
regretful
sighs
and
with
eyes
forgetful
weeps
that
no
loves
endure
then
she
handed
the
book
it
was
the
only
copy
to
the
boy
sitting
in
front
of
her
and
he
rose
to
read
the
next
verse
prestonby
catching
the
teacher
eye
nodded
and
smiled
this
was
a
class
of
course
but
from
spells
hat
to
swinburne
in
three
years
was
good
work
there
were
three
other
classes
a
total
of
little
over
a
hundred
students
there
was
no
trouble
they
were
there
for
one
purpose
only
to
learn
he
spoke
with
one
of
the
teachers
whose
class
was
busy
with
a
written
exercise
he
talked
for
a
while
to
another
whose
only
duty
at
the
moment
was
to
answer
questions
and
furnish
help
to
a
small
class
who
were
reading
silently
from
a
variety
of
volumes
only
a
hundred
and
twenty
out
of
five
thousand
yetsko
said
to
him
as
they
were
dropping
down
in
the
elevator
by
which
they
had
come
think
you
ever
really
get
anything
done
with
them
i
wo
maybe
they
wo
he
replied
but
the
ones
they
teach
will
they
just
a
cadre
it
take
fifty
years
before
the
effects
are
really
felt
but
some
day
the
shops
a
good
half
of
the
school
was
were
noisy
and
busy
here
prestonby
kept
his
hand
on
his
and
yetsko
had
his
rubber
hose
ready
either
to
strike
or
to
discard
in
favor
of
his
pistol
the
instructors
were
similarly
on
the
alert
and
ready
for
trouble
he
had
seen
penitentiaries
where
the
guards
took
it
easier
carpentry
and
building
trades
machine
shop
welding
and
tv
repair
shops
he
made
a
minor
and
relatively
honest
graft
there
from
the
sale
of
rebuilt
equipment
even
an
shop
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
that
would
excite
a
geiger
more
than
the
instructor
watch
domestic
science
home
decorating
home
handicrafts
use
of
home
appliances
beautician
school
charm
school
he
and
yetsko
sampled
the
products
of
the
cooking
school
intended
for
the
cafeteria
and
found
them
edible
if
uninspired
business
classes
in
recording
letters
using
illiterate
preparing
illiterate
cards
for
same
filing
recordings
always
with
the
counsel
when
in
doubt
consult
a
literate
general
arts
spanish
and
french
from
elaborate
record
players
the
progeny
of
the
old
twentieth
century
linguaphone
english
with
composition
enunciation
training
semantics
and
what
prestonby
called
english
illiterature
the
class
he
visited
was
drowsing
through
one
of
the
less
colorful
sections
of
gone
with
the
wind
world
history
with
half
the
students
frankly
asleep
through
an
on
the
feudal
system
with
planted
hints
on
how
nice
a
revival
of
same
would
be
and
identifying
the
clergy
of
the
middle
ages
with
the
fraternities
of
literates
american
history
with
the
class
wide
awake
since
custer
massacre
was
obviously
only
moments
away
wantta
bet
one
of
those
little
cherubs
does
try
to
scalp
another
before
the
day
out
yetsko
whispered
prestonby
shook
his
head
no
bet
remember
that
film
on
the
spanish
inquisition
that
we
had
to
discontinue
it
was
then
that
the
light
on
the
classroom
screen
which
had
been
flickering
green
and
white
suddenly
began
flashing
signal
prestonby
found
frank
cardon
looking
out
of
the
screen
in
his
private
office
the
round
ordinarily
cheerful
face
was
serious
but
the
innocent
blue
eyes
were
as
unreadable
as
ever
he
was
wearing
one
of
the
new
mexican
jackets
black
laced
with
silver
i
ca
see
all
your
office
ralph
he
said
as
prestonby
approached
are
you
alone
doug
yetsko
all
prestonby
said
and
as
cardon
hesitated
added
do
be
silly
frank
he
my
bodyguard
what
could
i
be
in
that
he
would
know
all
about
cardon
nodded
well
we
in
a
jam
up
to
here
a
handwave
conveyed
the
impression
that
the
sea
of
troubles
had
risen
to
his
chin
he
spoke
at
some
length
describing
the
fight
between
chester
pelton
and
stephen
bayne
the
literate
strike
at
pelton
paradise
pelton
heart
attack
and
the
circumstances
of
opening
the
safe
so
you
see
he
finished
maybe
latterman
tried
to
kill
pelton
maybe
he
just
tried
to
do
what
he
did
i
ca
take
chances
either
way
prestonby
thought
furiously
you
say
claire
alone
at
the
store
with
her
father
and
a
couple
of
store
cops
sterling
characters
with
the
hearts
of
lions
and
the
brains
of
goldfish
cardon
replied
and
russ
latterman
and
maybe
four
or
five
conservative
goons
he
managed
to
infiltrate
into
the
store
prestonby
was
still
thinking
aloud
now
maybe
they
did
mean
to
kill
pelton
in
that
case
they
try
again
or
maybe
they
only
wanted
to
expose
claire
literacy
it
hard
to
say
what
else
they
try
maybe
kidnap
her
to
her
and
use
her
as
a
on
a
conservative
telecast
i
going
over
to
the
store
now
that
a
good
idea
ralph
if
you
had
thought
of
it
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
land
on
the
central
stage
ask
for
sergeant
coccozello
of
the
store
police
and
give
my
name
even
aside
from
everything
else
it
be
a
good
idea
to
have
somebody
there
who
can
read
and
dares
admit
it
till
a
new
crew
of
literates
can
get
there
you
were
speaking
about
the
possibility
of
kidnaping
how
about
the
boy
ray
prestonby
nodded
i
have
him
come
here
to
my
office
and
stay
there
till
i
get
back
i
have
yetsko
stay
with
him
he
turned
to
where
the
big
man
in
black
leather
stood
guard
at
the
door
doug
go
get
ray
pelton
and
bring
him
here
check
with
miss
collins
for
where
he
be
now
he
turned
back
to
the
screen
anything
else
frank
is
that
enough
the
demanded
i
call
you
at
the
store
after
a
while
the
screen
darkened
as
cardon
broke
the
connection
prestonby
got
to
his
feet
went
to
his
desk
and
picked
up
a
pipe
digging
out
the
ashes
from
the
bowl
with
an
ice
pick
that
one
of
the
teachers
had
taken
from
a
murderer
he
checked
his
tablet
gun
made
sure
that
there
was
an
extra
loaded
clip
in
the
holster
and
got
two
more
spare
clips
from
the
arms
locker
then
to
make
sure
he
called
pelton
store
talking
for
a
while
to
the
police
sergeant
cardon
had
mentioned
by
the
time
he
was
finished
the
door
opened
and
yetsko
ushered
ray
pelton
in
what
happened
the
boy
asked
doug
told
me
that
the
senator
my
father
had
another
heart
attack
yes
ray
i
do
believe
he
in
any
great
danger
he
at
the
store
resting
in
his
office
he
went
on
to
tell
the
boy
what
had
happened
exactly
and
in
full
detail
he
was
only
fifteen
but
already
he
had
completed
the
reading
course
and
he
could
think
a
great
deal
more
logically
than
seventy
per
cent
of
the
people
who
were
legally
entitled
to
vote
ray
listened
seriously
and
proved
prestonby
confidence
justified
by
nodding
he
said
succinctly
stinks
like
a
glue
factory
of
a
job
something
going
to
happen
to
russ
latterman
one
of
these
days
i
think
you
better
let
frank
cardon
take
care
of
him
ray
prestonby
advised
i
think
there
are
more
angles
to
this
than
he
told
me
now
i
going
over
to
the
store
somebody
got
to
stay
with
claire
i
want
you
to
stay
here
in
this
room
if
anybody
sends
you
any
message
supposed
to
be
from
me
just
ignore
it
it
be
a
trap
if
i
want
to
get
in
touch
with
you
i
call
you
with
mean
somebody
might
try
to
kidnap
me
or
claire
to
force
the
senator
to
withdraw
or
something
ray
asked
his
eyes
widening
you
catch
on
quickly
ray
prestonby
commended
him
doug
you
stay
with
ray
till
i
get
back
do
let
him
out
of
your
sight
for
an
instant
at
noon
have
miss
collins
get
lunches
for
both
of
you
sent
up
if
i
not
back
by
take
him
to
his
home
and
stay
with
him
there
illustration
for
half
an
hour
frank
cardon
made
a
flying
tour
of
borough
headquarters
even
at
the
manhattan
headquarters
which
he
visited
immediately
after
his
talk
with
prestonby
the
news
had
already
gotten
out
the
atmosphere
of
optimistic
triumph
which
had
undoubtedly
followed
mongery
telecast
and
his
report
on
the
trotter
poll
had
evaporated
the
literate
clerical
help
was
gathered
in
a
tight
knot
obviously
a
little
worried
and
just
as
obviously
enjoying
the
reaction
in
smaller
and
constantly
changing
groups
the
volunteers
the
paid
helpers
the
the
goon
gangs
gathered
talking
in
worried
or
frightened
or
angry
voices
when
cardon
entered
and
was
recognized
there
was
a
concerted
movement
toward
him
his
two
regular
bodyguards
both
on
leave
from
the
literate
storm
troops
moved
quickly
to
range
themselves
on
either
side
of
him
with
a
gesture
he
halted
the
others
hold
it
he
called
i
know
what
you
worried
about
i
was
there
when
it
happened
and
saw
everything
he
paused
to
let
them
assimilate
that
and
continued
now
get
this
all
of
you
our
boss
and
he
our
next
senator
was
the
victim
of
a
deliberate
murder
attempt
by
literate
first
class
bayne
who
threw
out
his
supply
of
nitrocaine
bulbs
and
then
goaded
him
into
a
heart
attack
which
except
for
his
daughter
would
have
been
fatal
claire
pelton
deserves
the
deepest
gratitude
of
every
in
the
state
she
a
smart
girl
and
she
saved
the
life
of
her
father
and
our
leader
but
she
is
a
literate
he
cried
loudly
all
she
did
was
something
any
of
you
could
have
done
something
i
done
myself
so
that
i
wo
be
locked
out
of
my
own
safe
and
have
to
wait
for
a
literate
to
come
and
open
it
for
me
she
simply
kept
her
eye
on
the
literates
who
were
opening
the
safe
and
learned
the
combination
from
the
positions
to
which
they
turned
the
dial
and
you
believe
on
the
strength
of
that
that
she
a
literate
the
next
thing
you
be
believing
that
professional
liar
of
a
slade
gardner
and
you
call
yourselves
politicians
he
fairly
gargled
obscenities
looking
around
he
caught
sight
of
a
pair
who
seemed
something
less
than
impressed
with
his
account
of
it
joe
west
horace
yingling
thin
and
gangling
they
were
party
people
they
were
from
the
political
action
committee
of
the
consolidated
illiterates
organization
and
their
slogan
was
simpler
and
more
to
the
point
than
chester
pelton
the
only
good
literate
is
a
dead
literate
he
tensed
himself
and
challenged
them
directly
joe
horace
how
about
you
satisfied
the
pelton
girl
is
a
literate
now
yingling
looked
at
west
and
west
looked
back
at
him
questioningly
evidently
the
in
was
yingling
province
and
the
in
was
west
yeh
sure
cardon
yingling
said
dubiously
now
that
you
explain
it
we
see
how
it
was
it
was
worse
than
that
in
some
of
the
other
boroughs
one
fanatic
imagining
that
cardon
himself
was
a
drew
a
gun
cardon
guards
disarmed
him
and
beat
him
senseless
at
another
headquarters
some
character
was
circulating
about
declaring
that
not
only
claire
pelton
but
her
younger
brother
ray
as
well
were
literates
cardon
two
men
hustled
him
out
of
the
building
and
after
about
twenty
minutes
returned
alone
cardon
hoped
that
the
body
would
not
be
found
until
after
the
polls
closed
the
next
day
finally
leaving
his
guards
with
the
at
a
public
landing
stage
he
made
his
way
by
devious
routes
to
william
office
and
found
lancedale
at
his
desk
seeming
not
to
have
moved
since
he
had
showed
his
agent
out
earlier
in
the
day
well
we
in
a
nice
puddle
of
cardon
greeted
him
on
top
of
that
gardner
telecast
this
morning
guthrie
parham
taking
care
of
that
and
everything
going
to
be
done
to
ridicule
gardner
lancedale
told
him
and
even
this
business
at
the
store
can
be
turned
to
some
advantage
before
we
through
we
may
gain
more
votes
than
we
lose
for
pelton
and
we
had
an
informal
meeting
joyner
for
retail
merchandising
starke
for
grievance
settlements
and
four
or
five
others
including
myself
to
make
up
a
quorum
we
had
bayne
in
and
heard
his
story
of
it
and
we
got
a
report
from
one
of
our
stoolies
in
the
store
bayne
thought
he
was
due
for
a
commendation
instead
he
got
an
of
course
it
was
a
fact
that
pelton
hit
him
and
we
ca
have
literates
punched
around
regardless
of
provocation
so
we
voted
to
fine
pelton
ten
million
for
beating
bayne
up
and
to
award
him
ten
million
for
losses
resulting
from
unauthorized
withdrawal
of
literate
services
we
ordered
a
new
crew
of
literates
to
the
store
and
we
exiled
bayne
to
brooklyn
to
something
called
stillman
used
copter
and
junk
bazaar
for
the
next
few
months
the
only
thing
he
find
that
round
and
pinchable
will
be
tires
but
do
be
too
hard
on
him
i
think
he
did
us
a
favor
you
mean
starting
a
rift
between
pelton
and
the
consolidated
illiterates
organization
which
we
can
widen
after
the
election
no
i
had
thought
of
it
that
way
frank
lancedale
smiled
an
idea
worth
keeping
in
mind
and
we
exploit
it
later
what
i
was
thinking
about
was
the
more
immediate
problem
of
the
election
the
buzzer
on
lancedale
desk
interrupted
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
commo
box
message
urgent
and
private
sir
source
named
as
sforza
cardon
recognized
the
name
maybe
the
have
troubles
too
he
thought
hopefully
then
lancedale
video
screen
became
the
frame
for
an
almost
unbelievably
commonplace
set
of
features
sforza
sir
the
man
in
the
screen
said
sorry
i
late
but
i
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
building
only
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
had
to
make
sure
i
was
wearing
a
tail
i
have
two
new
facts
first
the
conservatives
have
been
bringing
storm
troops
in
from
outside
from
philadelphia
and
from
and
from
buffalo
they
are
being
concentrated
in
lower
manhattan
in
plain
clothes
with
only
concealed
weapons
and
carrying
their
hoods
folded
up
under
their
coats
second
i
overheard
a
few
snatches
of
conversation
between
two
of
the
conservative
storm
troop
leaders
as
follows
start
it
in
china
and
important
to
make
it
appear
either
spontaneous
or
planned
for
business
motives
try
to
get
us
more
information
as
quickly
as
possible
lancedale
directed
obviously
we
should
know
by
about
thirteen
hundred
what
being
planned
right
sir
lancedale
spy
at
headquarters
nodded
and
vanished
from
the
screen
what
does
it
sound
like
to
you
frank
lancedale
asked
china
is
obviously
a
for
some
place
in
downtown
manhattan
where
the
conservative
goon
gangs
are
being
concentrated
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
probably
is
not
chinatown
either
say
and
not
or
they
would
use
some
that
was
so
close
to
the
actual
name
cardon
considered
what
they
going
to
start
at
which
is
only
two
hours
and
a
half
from
now
is
probably
some
kind
of
a
riot
a
riot
which
could
arise
from
business
motives
lancedale
added
that
sounds
like
the
docks
or
the
wholesale
district
or
the
garment
district
or
something
like
that
he
passed
his
hand
rapidly
over
the
photoelectric
eye
of
the
commo
box
get
me
major
slater
he
said
and
a
little
later
major
get
a
platoon
out
to
long
island
to
chester
pelton
home
have
the
place
searched
for
possible
booby
traps
and
maintain
guard
there
till
further
notice
you
have
no
trouble
with
the
servants
they
all
in
our
pay
that
platoon
must
not
repeat
not
wear
uniform
or
appear
to
have
any
connection
with
the
fraternities
put
another
platoon
in
pelton
store
concealed
weapons
and
plain
clothes
they
should
carry
their
leather
helmets
in
shopping
bags
and
roam
about
in
the
store
ostensibly
shopping
and
a
full
company
uniformed
and
armed
with
heavy
weapons
alerted
and
ready
for
immediate
movement
he
went
on
to
explain
about
the
intelligence
report
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
it
the
guards
officer
repeated
back
his
instructions
and
lancedale
broke
the
connection
now
frank
he
said
i
told
you
that
this
revelation
of
claire
pelton
literacy
can
be
turned
to
our
advantage
there
to
be
a
full
council
meeting
at
thirteen
hundred
here
what
i
estimate
joyner
and
graves
will
try
to
do
and
here
what
i
going
to
do
to
counter
it
a
couple
of
men
in
the
maroon
uniform
of
pelton
store
police
were
waiting
as
prestonby
landed
on
the
top
stage
one
of
them
touched
his
with
his
in
salute
and
said
literate
prestonby
miss
pelton
is
expecting
you
she
in
her
father
office
this
way
if
you
please
sir
he
had
hoped
to
find
her
alone
but
when
he
entered
the
office
he
saw
five
or
six
of
the
store
personnel
with
her
since
opening
her
father
safe
she
had
evidently
dropped
all
pretense
of
illiteracy
there
was
a
mass
of
papers
spread
on
the
big
desk
and
she
was
referring
from
one
to
another
of
them
with
the
deft
skill
of
a
regular
fraternities
literate
while
the
others
watched
in
fascinated
horror
wait
a
moment
hutschnecker
she
told
the
man
in
the
blue
and
orange
business
suit
with
whom
she
had
been
talking
and
laid
the
printed
down
advancing
to
meet
him
ralph
she
greeted
him
frank
cardon
told
me
you
were
coming
i
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
the
afternoon
over
two
years
ago
when
she
had
entered
his
office
at
the
school
and
he
had
recognized
her
as
the
older
sister
of
young
ray
pelton
professor
prestonby
she
had
begun
accusingly
you
have
been
teaching
my
brother
raymond
pelton
to
read
he
had
been
prepared
for
that
had
known
that
sooner
or
later
there
would
be
some
minor
leak
in
the
security
screen
around
the
classrooms
on
the
top
floor
my
dear
miss
pelton
he
had
protested
pleasantly
i
think
become
overwrought
over
nothing
this
pretense
to
literacy
is
a
phase
most
boys
of
ray
age
pass
through
they
do
it
just
as
they
play
or
a
few
years
earlier
the
usual
trick
is
to
memorize
something
heard
from
a
record
disk
and
then
pretend
to
read
it
from
print
do
try
to
kid
me
professor
i
know
that
ray
can
read
i
can
prove
it
and
supposing
he
has
learned
a
few
words
he
had
parried
can
you
be
sure
i
taught
him
and
if
so
what
had
you
thought
of
doing
about
it
are
you
going
to
expose
me
as
a
corrupter
of
youth
not
unless
i
have
to
she
had
replied
coolly
i
going
to
blackmail
you
professor
i
want
you
to
teach
me
to
read
too
now
with
this
gang
of
her
father
illiterate
store
officials
present
a
quick
handclasp
and
a
glance
were
all
they
could
exchange
how
is
he
claire
he
asked
out
of
danger
for
the
present
there
was
a
medic
here
who
left
just
before
you
arrived
he
brought
nitrocaine
bulbs
and
gave
father
something
to
make
him
sleep
he
lying
down
back
in
his
rest
room
she
led
him
to
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
office
and
motioned
him
to
enter
following
him
he
going
to
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
yet
the
room
was
a
sort
of
bedroom
and
dressing
room
with
a
miniscule
toilet
and
shower
beyond
pelton
was
lying
on
his
back
sleeping
his
face
was
pale
but
he
was
breathing
easily
and
regularly
two
of
the
store
policemen
a
sergeant
and
a
patrolman
were
playing
cards
on
the
little
table
and
the
patrolman
had
a
burp
gun
within
reach
all
right
sergeant
claire
said
you
and
gorman
go
out
to
the
office
call
me
if
anything
comes
up
that
needs
my
attention
in
the
next
few
minutes
the
sergeant
started
to
protest
claire
cut
him
off
there
no
danger
here
this
literate
can
be
trusted
he
a
friend
of
cardon
works
at
the
brewery
it
all
right
the
two
rose
and
went
out
leaving
the
door
barely
ajar
prestonby
and
claire
like
a
pair
of
marionettes
on
the
same
set
of
strings
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
door
and
then
were
in
each
other
arms
chester
pelton
slept
placidly
as
they
kissed
and
whispered
endearments
it
was
claire
who
terminated
the
embrace
looking
apprehensively
at
her
slumbering
father
ralph
what
it
all
about
she
asked
i
did
even
know
that
you
and
frank
cardon
knew
each
other
let
alone
that
he
had
any
idea
about
us
prestonby
thought
furiously
trying
to
find
a
safe
path
through
the
tangle
of
claire
pelton
conflicting
loyalties
trying
to
find
a
path
between
his
own
loyalties
and
his
love
for
her
wondering
how
much
it
would
be
safe
to
tell
her
and
cardon
gone
completely
she
continued
he
talking
about
plots
against
my
father
life
and
against
me
and
a
lot
of
things
are
going
on
under
cloaks
around
here
he
told
her
and
under
literate
smocks
and
under
other
kinds
of
costume
and
a
lot
of
daggers
are
out
too
you
did
know
frank
cardon
was
a
literate
did
you
her
eyes
widened
i
thought
i
was
literate
enough
to
spot
literacy
in
anybody
else
she
said
no
i
never
even
suspected
somebody
rapped
on
the
door
miss
pelton
the
sergeant
voice
called
visiphone
call
from
literates
hall
prestonby
smiled
i
take
it
if
you
do
mind
he
said
here
now
i
suppose
she
followed
him
as
he
went
out
into
pelton
office
when
he
snapped
on
the
screen
a
young
man
in
a
white
smock
with
the
fraternities
executive
section
badge
looked
out
of
it
he
gave
a
slight
start
when
he
saw
prestonby
literate
first
class
ralph
prestonby
acting
voluntarily
for
pelton
purchasers
paradise
during
emergency
he
said
literate
first
class
armandez
executive
section
the
man
in
the
screen
replied
this
call
is
in
connection
with
the
recent
attack
of
chester
pelton
upon
literate
first
class
bayne
continue
understanding
that
we
admit
nothing
prestonby
told
him
an
extemporary
session
of
the
council
has
found
pelton
guilty
of
assaulting
literate
bayne
and
has
fined
him
ten
million
dollars
armandez
announced
we
enter
protest
prestonby
replied
automatically
wait
a
moment
literate
the
council
has
also
awarded
purchasers
paradise
damages
to
the
extent
of
ten
million
dollars
for
losses
incurred
by
suspension
of
literate
service
and
voted
censure
against
literate
bayne
for
ordering
said
suspension
without
consent
of
the
council
furthermore
a
new
crew
of
literates
with
their
novices
guards
et
cetera
is
being
sent
at
once
to
your
store
obviously
neither
the
fraternities
nor
pelton
nor
the
public
would
be
benefitted
by
returning
literate
bayne
or
any
of
his
crew
he
has
been
given
another
assignment
thank
you
and
when
can
we
expect
this
new
crew
of
literates
prestonby
asked
the
man
in
the
screen
consulted
his
watch
probably
inside
of
an
hour
we
had
to
do
some
you
know
how
these
things
are
handled
and
if
you
pardon
me
literate
just
what
are
you
doing
at
pelton
i
understood
that
you
were
principal
of
mineola
high
school
that
a
good
question
prestonby
hastily
assessed
the
circumstances
and
their
implications
i
suggest
that
you
ask
it
of
my
superior
literate
lancedale
however
the
literate
in
the
screen
blinked
that
was
the
equivalent
for
him
of
anybody
else
jaw
dropping
to
his
midriff
well
a
pleasure
literate
good
day
miss
pelton
the
man
in
the
suit
was
still
trying
to
catch
her
attention
where
are
we
going
to
put
that
stuff
russ
latterman
out
in
the
store
somewhere
and
i
ca
get
in
touch
with
him
what
did
you
say
it
was
she
replied
fireworks
for
the
peace
day
trade
we
want
to
get
it
on
sale
about
the
middle
of
the
month
this
was
a
fine
time
to
deliver
them
peace
day
is
till
the
tenth
of
december
put
them
down
in
the
fireproof
vault
that
place
is
full
of
photographic
film
and
sporting
ammunition
and
other
merchandise
stuff
we
have
to
draw
out
to
replace
stock
on
the
shelves
during
the
sale
the
illiterate
objected
the
weather
forecast
for
the
next
couple
of
days
is
fair
prestonby
reminded
her
why
not
just
pile
the
stuff
on
the
top
stage
beyond
the
control
tower
and
put
up
warning
signs
the
man
hutschnecker
prestonby
remembered
hearing
claire
call
him
nodded
that
might
be
all
right
we
could
cover
the
cases
with
tarpaulins
a
buzzer
drew
one
of
the
illiterates
to
a
handphone
he
listened
for
a
moment
and
turned
hey
there
a
armytage
zydanowycz
down
in
furs
she
wants
to
buy
one
of
those
coats
and
she
only
got
half
a
million
bucks
with
her
how
her
credit
claire
handed
prestonby
a
book
confidential
guide
look
her
up
for
us
she
said
another
buzzer
rasped
before
prestonby
could
find
the
entry
on
zydanowycz
armytage
the
illiterate
office
worker
laying
down
one
phone
grabbed
up
another
they
all
outta
small
money
in
notions
every
son
and
his
been
in
there
in
the
last
hour
to
buy
a
pair
of
dollar
shoestrings
with
a
i
take
care
of
that
hutschnecker
said
wait
till
i
call
control
tower
and
tell
them
about
the
fireworks
how
much
does
armytage
zydanowycz
want
credit
for
prestonby
asked
the
book
says
her
husband
good
for
up
to
fifteen
million
or
fifty
million
in
thirty
days
those
coats
are
only
five
million
claire
said
let
her
have
it
be
sure
to
get
her
thumbprint
though
and
send
it
up
here
for
comparison
oh
claire
do
you
know
how
we
going
to
handle
this
new
literate
crew
when
they
get
here
yes
here
the
to
for
literate
service
she
tossed
a
big
chart
across
the
desk
to
him
i
made
a
few
notes
on
it
you
can
give
it
to
whoever
is
in
charge
it
went
on
like
that
for
the
next
hour
when
the
new
literate
crew
arrived
prestonby
was
delighted
to
find
a
friend
and
a
of
lancedale
in
charge
considering
that
retail
merchandising
was
wilton
joyner
section
that
was
a
good
omen
lancedale
must
have
succeeded
to
an
extraordinary
degree
in
imposing
his
will
on
the
grand
council
prestonby
found
however
that
he
would
need
some
time
to
brief
the
new
chief
literate
on
the
operational
details
at
the
store
he
was
unwilling
to
bring
claire
too
prominently
into
the
conference
although
he
realized
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
half
an
hour
at
the
outside
before
every
one
of
the
new
literate
crew
would
have
heard
about
her
literate
ability
if
only
played
dumb
after
opening
that
safe
finally
by
the
new
literates
had
taken
over
and
the
sale
was
running
smoothly
again
latterman
was
somewhere
out
in
the
store
helping
them
claire
had
lunch
for
herself
and
prestonby
sent
up
from
the
restaurant
and
for
a
while
they
ate
in
silence
broken
by
occasional
spatters
of
then
she
returned
to
the
question
she
had
raised
and
he
had
not
yet
answered
you
say
frank
cardon
a
literate
she
asked
then
what
he
doing
managing
the
senator
campaign
he
shook
his
head
you
think
the
fraternities
are
a
solid
monolithic
organization
everybody
agreed
on
aims
and
means
and
working
together
in
harmony
that
how
it
supposed
to
look
from
the
outside
on
the
inside
though
there
a
bitter
struggle
going
on
between
two
factions
over
policy
and
for
control
one
faction
wants
to
maintain
the
a
handful
of
literates
doing
the
reading
and
writing
for
an
illiterate
public
and
holding
a
monopoly
on
literacy
they
headed
by
two
men
wilton
joyner
and
harvey
graves
bayne
was
one
of
that
faction
he
paused
thinking
quickly
if
lancedale
had
gotten
the
upper
hand
there
was
likely
to
be
a
revision
of
the
attitude
toward
pelton
in
that
case
the
less
he
said
to
incriminate
russell
latterman
the
better
let
bayne
be
the
villain
for
a
while
he
decided
bayne
he
continued
is
one
of
a
small
minority
of
fanatics
who
make
a
religion
of
literacy
i
believe
he
disposed
of
your
medicine
and
then
deliberately
goaded
him
into
a
rage
to
bring
on
a
heart
attack
that
does
represent
policy
it
was
just
something
he
did
on
his
own
he
probably
been
disciplined
for
it
by
now
but
the
faction
are
working
for
your
defeat
and
the
of
grant
hamilton
the
other
faction
is
headed
by
a
man
you
probably
never
heard
of
william
lancedale
i
of
his
faction
and
so
is
frank
cardon
we
want
to
see
your
father
elected
because
the
socialization
of
literacy
would
eventually
put
the
literates
in
complete
control
of
the
government
we
also
want
to
see
literacy
become
widespread
eventually
universal
just
as
it
was
before
world
war
iv
but
would
that
mean
the
end
of
the
fraternities
claire
asked
that
what
joyner
and
graves
say
we
do
believe
so
and
suppose
it
did
lancedale
says
if
we
so
incompetent
that
we
have
to
keep
the
rest
of
the
world
in
ignorance
to
earn
a
living
the
better
off
without
us
he
says
that
every
oligarchy
carries
in
it
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction
that
if
we
ca
evolve
with
the
rest
of
the
world
we
doomed
in
any
case
that
why
we
want
to
elect
your
father
if
he
can
get
his
socialized
literacy
program
adopted
be
in
a
position
to
load
the
public
with
so
many
controls
and
restrictions
and
formalities
that
even
the
most
bigoted
illiterate
will
want
to
learn
to
read
lancedale
says
a
private
monopoly
like
ours
is
bad
but
a
government
monopoly
is
intolerable
and
the
only
way
the
public
can
get
rid
of
it
would
be
by
becoming
literates
themselves
she
glanced
toward
the
door
of
pelton
private
rest
room
poor
senator
she
said
softly
he
hates
literacy
so
and
his
own
children
are
literates
and
his
program
against
literacy
is
being
twisted
against
itself
but
you
agree
that
we
right
and
he
wrong
prestonby
asked
you
must
or
you
never
have
come
to
me
to
learn
to
read
he
such
a
good
father
i
hate
to
see
him
hurt
she
said
but
ralph
you
my
man
anything
you
for
i
for
and
anything
you
against
i
against
he
caught
her
hand
across
the
table
forgetful
of
the
others
in
the
office
claire
now
that
everybody
knows
he
began
emergency
top
emergency
a
voice
brayed
out
of
the
alarm
box
on
the
wall
disorder
in
department
serious
disorder
in
department
the
voice
broke
off
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
but
the
box
was
not
silent
from
it
came
a
medley
of
shouts
curses
feminine
screams
and
splintering
crashes
prestonby
and
claire
were
on
their
feet
you
have
wall
screens
he
asked
how
do
they
work
like
the
ones
at
school
claire
twisted
a
knob
until
the
number
appeared
on
a
dial
and
pressed
a
button
on
the
screen
the
chinaware
department
on
the
third
floor
came
to
life
in
full
sound
and
color
the
pickup
must
have
been
across
an
aisle
from
the
box
from
whence
the
alarm
had
come
they
could
see
one
of
pelton
illiterate
clerks
lying
unconscious
under
it
and
the
handphone
dangling
at
the
end
of
its
cord
the
aisles
were
full
of
jostling
screaming
women
trampling
one
another
and
fighting
frantically
to
get
out
and
among
them
groups
of
three
or
four
men
were
gathered
back
to
back
one
such
group
had
caught
a
store
policeman
three
were
holding
him
while
a
fourth
smashed
vases
over
his
head
grabbing
them
from
a
nearby
counter
a
pink
dinner
plate
came
skimming
up
from
the
crowd
narrowly
missing
the
wired
tv
pickup
a
moment
later
a
sugar
bowl
thrown
with
better
aim
came
curving
at
them
in
the
screen
it
scored
a
hit
and
brought
darkness
though
the
bedlam
of
sound
continued
illustration

cardon
looked
at
his
watch
as
he
entered
the
council
chamber
at
literates
hall
smoothing
his
smock
hastily
under
his
sam
browne
he
made
it
with
very
little
time
to
spare
before
the
doors
would
be
sealed
and
the
meeting
would
begin
he
been
all
over
town
tracking
down
that
report
of
sforza
he
even
made
a
quick
visit
to
chinatown
on
the
off
chance
that
china
had
been
used
in
an
attempt
at
the
double
concealment
of
the
obvious
but
as
he
expected
found
nothing
the
people
there
hardly
knew
there
was
to
be
an
election
accustomed
for
millennia
to
ideographs
read
only
by
experts
they
viewed
the
current
uproar
about
literacy
with
unconcern
at
the
door
he
deposited
his
pocket
recorder
no
device
was
permitted
except
the
big
camera
in
front
which
made
the
single
permanent
record
going
around
the
room
counterclockwise
to
the
seats
of
his
faction
he
encountered
two
other
lancedale
men
gerald
toppington
of
the
technological
section
balding
and
franklin
chernov
commander
of
the
local
literates
guards
brigade
with
his
ragged
gray
mustache
his
horribly
scarred
face
and
his
outsize
almost
as
big
as
a
catalogue
what
trying
to
do
to
us
frank
chernov
rumbled
gutturally
it
what
we
going
to
do
to
them
cardon
replied
did
the
chief
tell
you
chernov
shook
his
head
no
time
i
only
got
here
fifteen
minutes
ago
chasing
all
over
town
about
that
tip
from
sforza
nothing
of
course
nothing
from
sforza
either
the
thing
must
have
been
planned
weeks
ago
whatever
it
is
and
everybody
briefed
personally
and
nothing
on
disk
or
tape
about
it
but
what
going
to
happen
here
lancedale
going
to
pull
a
rabbit
out
of
his
hat
cardon
explained
chernov
whistled
man
that
no
rabbit
that
a
bengal
tiger
i
hope
it
does
eat
us
by
mistake
cardon
looked
around
saw
lancedale
in
animated
argument
with
a
group
of
his
associates
some
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
sharing
fears
i
have
every
confidence
in
the
chief
toppington
said
if
his
tigers
make
a
meal
off
anybody
it
be
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
where
wilton
joyner
short
bald
pompous
and
harvey
graves
tall
and
cadaverous
stood
in
a
attitude
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
of
their
top
associates
the
council
president
morehead
came
out
a
little
door
onto
the
rostrum
and
took
his
seat
pressing
a
button
the
call
bell
began
clanging
slowly
lancedale
glancing
around
saw
cardon
and
nodded
on
both
sides
of
the
chamber
the
literates
began
taking
seats
and
finally
the
call
bell
stopped
and
literate
president
morehead
rapped
with
his
gavel
the
opening
formalities
were
hustled
through
the
routine
business
was
with
hasty
votes
of
approval
even
including
the
decisions
of
the
extemporary
meeting
of
that
morning
on
the
affair
at
pelton
finally
the
presiding
officer
rapped
again
and
announced
that
the
meeting
was
now
open
for
new
business
at
once
harvey
graves
was
on
his
feet
literate
president
he
began
as
soon
as
the
chair
had
recognized
him
this
is
scarcely
business
since
it
concerns
a
problem
a
most
serious
problem
which
i
and
some
of
my
colleagues
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
council
many
times
in
the
past
the
problem
of
black
literacy
he
spat
out
the
two
words
as
though
they
were
a
mouthful
of
poison
literate
president
and
fellow
literates
if
anything
could
destroy
our
fraternities
to
which
we
have
given
our
lives
devotion
it
would
be
the
widespread
tendency
to
the
fraternities
the
practice
of
literacy
by
people
we
heard
all
that
before
wilton
somebody
from
the
lancedale
side
called
out
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
that
you
gotten
on
every
record
of
every
meeting
for
the
last
thirty
years
why
this
pelton
business
graves
snapped
back
at
him
you
know
what
i
mean
your
own
associates
are
responsible
for
it
he
turned
back
to
face
the
chair
and
with
a
surprising
minimum
of
invective
described
the
scene
in
which
claire
pelton
had
demonstrated
her
literacy
and
that
not
all
brother
literates
he
continued
since
then
i
been
receiving
reports
from
the
pelton
store
claire
pelton
has
been
openly
doing
the
work
of
a
literate
going
over
the
store
written
records
checking
inventories
checking
the
credit
guide
handling
the
price
lists
what
that
got
to
do
with
black
literacy
gerald
toppington
demanded
black
literacy
is
a
term
which
labels
the
professional
practice
of
literacy
for
hire
by
a
literate
or
literate
service
furnished
for
criminal
or
politically
subversive
purposes
or
the
betrayal
of
a
client
by
a
fraternity
literate
there
nothing
of
the
sort
involved
here
this
girl
who
does
appear
to
be
literate
is
simply
looking
after
the
interests
of
her
business
she
was
taught
by
a
literate
a
under
to
say
the
very
least
irregular
circumstances
and
without
payment
of
any
fee
any
fee
that
is
that
the
fraternities
can
collect
any
percentage
on
and
the
literate
who
taught
her
also
taught
her
younger
brother
ray
pelton
and
this
literate
who
is
known
to
be
her
lover
suppose
he
is
her
lover
so
what
one
of
lancedale
partisans
demanded
you
say
yourself
that
she
a
literate
that
ought
to
remove
any
objection
why
if
she
were
to
come
forward
and
admit
and
demonstrate
her
literacy
there
be
no
possible
objection
from
the
fraternities
viewpoint
to
her
marrying
young
prestonby
and
as
for
prestonby
action
in
teaching
literacy
to
her
and
to
her
brother
cardon
spoke
up
i
think
he
deserves
the
thanks
and
commendation
of
the
fraternities
he
put
a
period
to
four
generations
of
bigoted
illiterates
wilton
joyner
was
on
his
feet
will
literate
graves
yield
for
a
motion
he
asked
thank
you
harvey
literate
president
and
brother
literates
i
yield
to
no
man
in
my
abhorrence
of
black
literacy
or
in
my
detestation
for
the
political
principles
of
which
chester
pelton
has
made
himself
the
spokesman
but
i
deny
that
we
should
allow
the
acts
and
opinions
of
the
illiterate
parent
to
sway
us
in
our
consideration
of
the
literate
children
it
has
come
to
my
notice
as
it
has
to
literate
graves
that
this
young
woman
claire
pelton
is
literate
to
a
degree
that
would
be
a
credit
to
any
literate
first
class
and
her
brother
can
match
his
literacy
creditably
against
that
of
any
novice
in
our
fraternities
to
show
that
we
respect
literate
ability
wherever
we
find
it
to
show
that
we
are
not
the
monopolistic
our
enemies
accuse
us
of
being
to
show
that
we
are
not
animated
by
a
vindictive
hatred
of
anything
bearing
the
name
of
pelton
i
move
and
ask
that
my
motion
be
presented
for
seconding
that
claire
pelton
and
her
brother
raymond
pelton
be
duly
elected
respectively
to
the
positions
of
literate
third
class
and
literate
novice
as
members
of
the
associated
fraternities
of
literates
from
the
side
there
were
dutiful
cries
of
yes
yes
admit
the
young
peltons
and
also
gasps
of
horrified
surprise
from
the
who
had
been
briefed
on
what
was
coming
up
lancedale
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
literate
president
he
cried
in
view
of
the
delicate
political
situation
and
in
view
of
chester
pelton
violent
denunciation
of
our
fraternities
literate
lancedale
the
president
objected
the
motion
is
not
to
be
debated
until
it
has
been
properly
seconded
what
does
the
literate
president
think
i
doing
lancedale
retorted
i
second
the
motion
joyner
looked
at
lancedale
in
angry
surprise
which
gradually
became
fearful
suspicion
his
stooge
who
had
already
risen
with
a
prepared
speech
of
seconding
simply
gaped
furthermore
lancedale
continued
i
move
an
amendment
to
literate
joyner
motion
i
move
that
the
ceremony
of
the
administration
of
the
literates
oath
and
the
investiture
in
the
smock
and
insignia
be
carried
out
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
an
recording
be
made
and
telecast
this
evening
before
hundred
brigade
commander
chernov
prodded
by
cardon
jumped
to
his
feet
excellent
he
cried
i
second
the
motion
to

a
bomb
cardon
could
guess
how

now
beginning
to
be
afraid
of
their
own
proposition
as
for
the
lancedale
literates
he
knew
how
many
of
them
felt
he
felt
the
same
way
himself
when
lancedale
had
proposed
the
idea
he
got
to
his
feet
literate
president
brother
literates
he
raised
his
voice
i
call

an
immediate

which
i
hope

an
opportunity
to
discuss
it
as
typical
of
our
problems
in
dealing
with

did
know
it
was
loaded

joyner
shouted
literate
president
lancedale
said
gently
his
thin
face
lighting
with
an
almost
saintly
smile
literate
joyner
simply
can
not
withdraw
his
motion
now
it
has
been
properly
seconded
and
placed
before
the
house
and
so
has
my
own
humble
contribution
to
it
i
demand
that
the
motion
be
acted
upon
vote
vote
vote
the
lancedale
literates
began
yelling
i
call
on
all
my
adherents
to

shouted
now
look
here
wilton
harvey
graves
shouted
reddening
with
anger
you
just
making
a
fool
out
of
me

your
idea

first
place

want
to
smash
everything
we
ever
done
in
the
fraternities
harvey
we
ca
go
on
with
it
joyner
replied
he
crossed
quickly
to
graves
seat
and
whispered
something
for
the
record
lancedale
said
sweetly
our
colleague
literate
joyner
has
just
whispered
to
literate
graves
that
since
i
have
seconded
his
motion
he
now
afraid
of
it
i
think
literate
graves
is
trying
to
assure
him
that
my
support
is
merely
a
bluff
for
the
information
of
this
body
i
want
to
state
categorically
that
it
is
not
and
that
i
will
be
deeply
disappointed
if
this
motion
does
not
pass
an
elderly
literate
on
the
side
an
undersized
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
narrow
mouth
was
on
his
feet
he
looked
like
an
aged
rat
brought
to
bay
by
a
terrier
i
was
against
this
fool
idea
from
the
start
he
yelled
we
got
to
keep
the
illiterates
down
how
are
we
ever
going
to
do
that
if
we
go
making
literates

of
them

where
sergeant
coccozello
and
his
subordinate
were
guarding
the
unconscious
pelton
sergeant
who
in
charge
of
store
police
now
coccozello
looked
blank
for
an
instant
i
guess
i
am
he
said
lieutenant
dunbar
off
on
his
vacation
in
mexico
and
captain
freizer
in
the
hospital
he
was
taken
sick
suddenly
last
evening
probably
poisoned
prestonby
thought
making
a
mental
note
to
find
out
which
hospital
and
get
in
touch
with
one
of
the
literate
medics
there
well
come
out
here
sergeant
and
have
a
look
around
the
store
on
the
tv
we
have
troubles
coccozello
could
hear
the
noise
that
was
still
coming
out
of
the
darkened
screen
as
he
stepped
forward
claire
got
another
pickup
some
distance
from
the
one
that
had
been
knocked
out
a
mob
of
women
customers
were
surging
away
from
the
chinaware
department
into
glassware
they
were
running
into
the
shopping
crowd
there
with
considerable
disturbance
a
couple
of
store
police
were
trying
to
get
through
the
packed
mass
of
humanity
and
making
slow
going
of
it
coccozello
swore
and
started
calling
on
his
reserves
on
one
of
the
handphones
wait
a
moment
sergeant
prestonby
stopped
him
do
commit
any
of
your
reserves
down
there
we
going
to
need
them
to
hold
the
executive
country
up
here
this
is
only
the
start
of
a
general
riot
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
know
about
it
coccozello
challenged
listen
to
him
guido
claire
said
he
knows
what
he
doing
claire
you
have
some
way
of
keeping
a
running
count
of
the
number
of
customers
in
and
out
of
the
store
have
you
prestonby
asked
why
yes
here
she
pointed
to
an
indicator
on
chester
desk
where
constantly
changing
numbers
danced
and
do
you
have
a
continuous
check
on
sales
too
how
do
they
jibe
they
do
look
sales
are
away
below
any
expectation
from
the
number
of
customers
even
allowing
for
shopping
habits
of
a
crowd
but
what
that
got
to
do
prestonby
was
back
at
the
tv
shifting
from
pickup
to
pickup
look
sergeant
claire
that
is
a
normal
crowd
is
it
look
at
those
groups
of
men
three
or
four
to
a
group
shifting
around
waiting
for
something
to
happen
this
store
been
infiltrated
by
a
big
goon
gang
that
business
in
chinaware
just
the
start
to
draw
our
reserves
down
to
the
third
floor
look
at
that
now
he
had
a
pickup
on
the
twelfth
floor
the
floor
just
under
the
public
landing
stages
and
at
the
foot
of
the
escalators
leading
to
the
central
executive
block
see
how
they
concentrating
there
he
pointed
out
in
that
ladies
wear
department
there
are
three
men
for
every
woman
and
the
men
are
all
drifting
from
counter
to
counter
over
in
the
direction
of
our
escalators
coccozello
swore
again
feelingly
literate
you
know
your
stuff
he
said
that
fuss
in
china
is
just
a
feint
this
is
where
really
going
to
hit
what
do
you
think
it
is
macy
gimbel
trying
to
bust
up
our
sale
or
politics
prestonby
shrugged
take
your
choice
a
competitor
would
concentrate
where
your
biggest
volume
of
sale
was
going
on
though
political
enemies
would
try
to
get
up
here
and
that
what
this
gang
trying
to
do
he
absolutely
right
guido
claire
told
the
sergeant
do
whatever
he
tells
you
sergeant
coccozello
looked
at
him
awaiting
orders
we
ca
commit
our
reserves
in
that
chinaware
department
fight
we
need
them
up
here
where
are
they
now
and
how
many
thirteen
counting
myself
and
the
man
in
there
he
nodded
toward
the
room
where
chester
pelton
lay
in
drugged
sleep
in
the
squad
room
on
the
floor
below
and
for
the
mob
below
to
get
up
here
two
escalators
sir
northeast
and
southwest
corners
of
office
country
and
we
got
some
new
counters
that
latterman
had
built
that
did
get
put
out
in
time
for
the
sale
we
can
use
them
to
build
barricades
if
we
have
to
how
about
a
attack
on
the
roof
coccozello
grinned
i
like
to
see
that
now
literate
we
got
plenty
of
equipment
up
there
four
machine
guns
two
and
one
we
could
hold
off
the
state
guard
with
that
that
is
saying
much
but
they
not
even
that
good
so
it
be
the

holdups
the
sergeant
grin
widened
fire
hose
one
at
the
head
of
each
escalator
and
a
couple
more
that
can
be
dragged
over
from
other
outlets
say
we
put
two
men
on
each
hose
lying
down
at
the
head
of
the
escalators
and
we
got
plenty
of
firearms
we
can
arm
some
of
these
clerks
up
here
all
right
do
that
and
put
out
an
emergency
call
by
telephone
not
by
public
address
to
floorwalkers
from
the
fifth
floor
down
to
gather
up
all
male
clerks
and
other
store
personnel
in
their
departments
arm
them
with
anything
they
can
find
and
rush
them
to
chinaware
tell
them
to
shout
when
they
hit
the
mob
to
avoid
breaking
each
others
heads
in
the
confusion
and
tell
them
they
expected
to
hold
the
chinaware
and
glassware
departments
themselves
without
any
help
from
the
store
police
why
not
claire
wanted
to
know

to
happen
at
the
wrong
time
and
place
prestonby

two
small
detachments

and
each
sends
back
for

the
next
thing
anybody
knows

a
battle
going
on

go
up
into
the
store
from
the
basement
bust
up
any
trouble
that
seems
to

started
if

your
main
mission

police
literates
literates

and
get

back
to
the
basement

picked
up

pad
from
a
desk
and

few
lines

illustration
russell
latterman
was
lunching
in
the
store
restaurant
at
a
table
next
the
thick
glass
partition
where
he
could
look
out
across
confectionery
and
pastries
toward
the
tobacco
shoppe
and
the
liquor
department
there
were
two
ways
of
looking
at
it
of
course
he
was
occupying
a
table
that
might
have
been
used
by
a
customer
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
known
by
sight
to
many
of
the
customers
and
the
fact
that
he
was
eating
here
had
some
advertising
value
and
he
could
keep
his
eye
on
the
business
going
on
around
him
off
in
the
distance
he
caught
the
white
flash
of
a
literate
smock
at
one
of
the
counters
one
of
the
new
crew
sent
in
to
replace
the
ones
bayne
had
pulled
out
he
was
glad
and
at
the
same
time
disturbed
he
had
had
his
doubts
about
staging
a
literates
strike
and
he
was
almost
positive
that
wilton
joyner
had
known
nothing
about
it
the
whole
thing
had
been
harvey
graves
idea
there
was
a
serious
question
of
literate
ethics
involved
to
say
nothing
of
the
effect
on
the
public
the
trick
of
forcing
claire
pelton
to
reveal
her
secret
literacy
was
all
right
although
he
wished
that
it
had
been
frank
cardon
who
had
opened
that
safe
or
did
he
cardon
would
have
brazened
it
out
claimed
to
have
memorized
the
combination
after
having
learned
it
by
observation
and
would
probably
have
gotten
away
with
it
but
that
silly
girl
had
lost
her
head
afterward
and
had
gone
on
to
brand
herself
irrevocably
as
a
literate
one
of
the
waitresses
was
hurrying
toward
him
almost
falling
over
herself
in
excitement
she
began
talking
when
she
was
ten
feet
from
the
table
latterman
mr
latterman
she
was
calling
to
him
a
terrible
fight
down
in
chinaware
well
what
do
we
have
store
police
for
he
demanded
they
can
take
care
of
it
now
be
quiet
madge
do
get
the
customers
excited
he
returned
to
his
lunch
watching
with
satisfaction
the
crowd
that
was
packing
into
the
liquor
department
next
to
the
restaurant
that
special
old
rye
had
been
a
good
idea
in
the
first
place
the
stuff
was
fit
for
nothing
but
cleaning
drains
and
removing
varnish
if
he
were
pelton
he
would
have
fired
that
fool
buyer
who
got
them
overstocked
on
it
but
the
outside
was
reiterating
whiskies
two
hundred
dollars
a
sixth
and
up
and
pulling
in
the
customers
who
when
they
discovered
that
the
bargain
was
old
were
shelling
out
five
hundred
to
a
grand
a
sixth
for
good
liquor
he
finished
his
coffee
and
got
to
his
feet
be
a
good
idea
to
look
in
on
liquor
and
see
how
things
were
going
the
department
was
getting
more
and
more
crowded
every
minute
three
customers
were
entering
for
every
one
who
left
on
the
way
he
passed
two
women
and
caught
a
snatch
of
conversation
do
go
down
on
the
third
floor
for
heaven
sake
terrible
fight
smashing
everything
up
worried
he
continued
into
liquor
and
the
looks
of
the
crowd
there
increased
his
worries
too
many
men
between
twenty
and
thirty
all
dressed
alike
looking
alike
talking
and
acting
alike
it
looked
like
a
infiltration
and
he
was
beginning
to
see
why
harvey
graves
had
wanted
the
literates
pulled
out
and
why
joyner
bound
by
ethics
to
do
nothing
against
the
commercial
interests
of
pelton
had
known
nothing
about
it
he
started
toward
a
counter
to
speak
to
a
clerk
but
one
of
the
stocky
young
men
stepped
in
front
of
him
gim
me
a
bottle
of
he
said
do
bother
wrapping
it
yes
sir
the
clerk
seemed
worried
too
he
got
the
bottle
and
set
it
on
the
counter
that
be
two
c
sir
i
see
you
wearing
a
button
the
customer
commented
because
you
want
to
or
because
chet
pelton
makes
you
pelton
never
interferes
with
his
employees
political
convictions
the
clerk
replied
loyally
saying
nothing
the
customer
took
the
bottle
swung
it
by
the
neck
and
smashed
it
over
the
clerk
head
knocking
him
senseless
that
all
that
rotgut
good
for
the
customer
said
jumping
over
the
counter
all
right
boys
help
yourselves
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
the
riot
was
localized
in
china
where
it
had
begun
using
alternately
three
around
the
scene
of
the
disturbance
prestonby
watched
its
progress
and
watched
successive
details
of
store
personnel
armed
with
clubs
and
a
few
knives
and
sono
pistols
hit
the
riot
shouting
their
battle
cry
and
vanish
they
were
of
course
lambs
of
sacrifice
however
unlamblike
their
conduct
they
were
buying
time
and
they
were
drawing
groups
of
goons
into
the
action
in
china
and
glassware
who
might
have
been
making
trouble
elsewhere
there
was
an
outbreak
on
the
sixth
floor
in
liquor
claire
touring
the
store
on
the
other
spotted
it
and
called
his
attention
to
it
back
of
the
shattered
glass
partition
a
mob
of
men
were
snatching
bottles
from
the
shelves
and
tossing
them
out
to
the
crowd
one
of
the
clerks
in
his
gray
uniform
jacket
was
lying
unconscious
outside
while
prestonby
watched
another
and
another
came
flying
out
the
doorway
a
fourth
victim
in
ordinary
business
clothes
tattered
and
disheveled
came
flying
out
after
them
to
land
in
a
heap
stunned
for
an
instant
and
then
pick
himself
up
prestonby
laughed
heartily
when
he
recognized
literate
undercover
first
class
russell
latterman
i
ought
to
have
anticipated
that
he
said
any
time
there
a
riot
the
liquor
stores
are
the
first
things
looted
the
liquor
stores
and
the
claire
see
what
going
on
in
sporting
goods
sporting
goods
between
tools
hardware
and
toys
on
the
fifth
floor
was
swamped
one
of
the
clerks
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
puddle
of
blood
past
any
help
none
of
the
others
were
in
sight
the
gun
racks
and
pistol
cases
were
being
cleaned
out
systematically
this
had
been
organized
in
advance
there
were
four
or
five
men
working
industriously
wiping
grease
out
of
bores
and
actions
before
handing
out
firearms
and
a
couple
more
making
sure
that
the
right
cartridges
went
with
each
weapon
somebody
had
brought
a
small
grinding
wheel
over
from
tools
and
plugged
it
in
and
was
grinding
points
on
the
foils
and
épées
others
were
collecting
baseball
bats
golf
clubs
and
football
helmets
and
catchers
masks
the
tool
department
was
being
stripped
of
everything
that
could
be
used
as
a
weapon
too
the
whole
store
by
this
time
was
an
approximation
of
mutiny
in
a
madhouse
dressgoods
was
being
looted
by
a
howling
mob
of
women
who
were
pulling
bolts
of
material
from
shelves
and
fighting
among
themselves
over
them
somebody
had
turned
on
the
electric
fans
and
long
streams
of
flimsy
fabric
were
blowing
about
like
a
surrealist
maypole
dance
somebody
in
household
furnishings
had
turned
on
a
couple
of
fans
too
and
a
mob
of
hoodlums
were
opening
cans
of
paint
and
throwing
them
into
the
fan
blades
the
little
antiques
department
in
a
corner
of
the
fourth
floor
back
of
the
gift
shoppe
was
an
island
of
peace
in
the
general
chaos
there
was
only
one
way
into
it
and
one
of
the
clerks
who
had
gotten
himself
into
a
suit
of
fifteenth
century
battle
armor
was
standing
in
the
entrance
leaning
on
a
sword
there
was
blood
on
the
long
blade
and
more
blood
splashed
on
the
floor
in
front
of
him
he
was
being
left
entirely
alone
hutschnecker
called
to
the
telephone
spoke
briefly
listened
for
a
while
spoke
again
in
hearty
thanks
and
hung
up
macy
gimbel
he
told
prestonby
they
heard
about
our
trouble
probably
one
of
their
phoned
in
about
it
and
they
offering
to
send
twenty
of
their
to
help
us
out
they
be
landing
on
our
stage
in
eight
minutes
rifles
and
steel
helmets
prestonby
nodded
it
would
have
been
quite
conceivable
that
chief
competitor
had
started
the
riot
since
they
had
their
offer
of
armed
aid
was
just
as
characteristic
of
the
bitter
but
rivalries
of
the
commercial
world
a
few
minutes
later
another
call
came
in
this
time
on
the
visiphone
prestonby
took
it
when
he
saw
a
literates
guards
officer
in
the
screen
and
recognized
him
that
you
prestonby
the
officer
major
slater
asked
in
some
surprise
did
know
you
were
at
pelton
what
going
on
there
prestonby
told
him
briefly
yes
we
had
some
of
our
people
at
the
store
in
plain
clothes
slater
said
just
in
case
of
trouble
on
orders
they
reported
a
riot
starting
but
naturally
their
reports
were
incomplete
can
you
get
one
of
your
landing
stages
cleared
for
us
we
have
two
hundred
men
in
twenty
then
he
must
have
noticed
some
of
the
store
illiterates
back
of
prestonby
and
realized
that
this
offer
of
help
to
literacy
worst
enemy
would
arouse
suspicion
not
that
we
care
what
happens
to
chester
pelton
but
we
have
to
protect
our
own
people
at
the
store
yes
of
course
prestonby
agreed
come
in
on
our
north
stage
you
probably
find
a
fight
going
on
on
our
twelfth
floor
just
inside
anybody
who
trying
to
get
up
the
escalators
to
the
office
block
will
be
an
enemy
right
we
halfway
there
now
the
literates
guards
officer
broke
the
connection
you
heard
that
he
asked
turning
to
the
others
in
the
office
if
we
can
hold
out
till
they
get
here
we
all
right
did
you
contact
headquarters
yet
hutschnecker
yes
i
talked
to
a
fellow
named
yingling
he
said
that
all
the
party
storm
troops
had
been
lured
out
to
some
kind
of
a
disturbance
in
north
jersey
borough
he
try
to
get
them
recalled
prestonby
swore
bitterly
by
the
time
his
own
get
here
the
literates
guards
and
macy
gimbel
will
have
pulled
bacon
off
the
fire
for
him
nice
friends
he
has
an
alarm
buzzer
went
off
suddenly
and
an
urgent
voice
came
out
of
the
box
on
the
wall
here
come
the
goons
south
escalator
prestonby
grabbed
a
burp
gun
and
a
canvas
musette
bag
full
of
clips
by
the
time
he
had
gotten
down
to
what
in
deference
to
the
superstitions
of
the
illiterate
store
force
was
known
as
the
fourteenth
floor
an
attack
on
the
north
escalator
had
developed
as
well
in
both
cases
the
attackers
seemed
to
expect
no
organized
resistance
they
simply
jumped
onto
the
escalators
adding
their
own
running
speed
and
came
rushing
up
firing
pistols
ahead
of
them
at
random
the
defenders
however
had
been
ready
the
fire
hoses
caught
those
in
the
lead
and
hurled
them
back
some
of
them
vaulted
the
barrier
between
the
ascending
and
descending
spirals
and
let
themselves
be
carried
down
again
less
than
five
minutes
after
the
buzzer
had
sounded
the
warning
the
attack
stopped
the
noise
on
the
twelfth
floor
increased
however
and
leaning
over
into
the
prestonby
could
see
the
rioters
firing
in
the
direction
of
the
entrance
from
the
north
landing
stage
within
a
matter
of
thirty
seconds
they
began
to
flee
and
a
wave
of
literates
guards
in
their
futuristic
space
cadet
uniforms
came
pouring
in
after
them
douglass
macarthur
yetsko
put
the
burp
gun
back
together
again
tried
the
action
and
laid
it
aside
with
a
sigh
he
had
cleaned
every
weapon
in
his
and
prestonby
private
arsenal
since
lunch
and
now
he
had
to
admit
the
unpalatable
fact
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
turn
on
the
tv
ray
had
been
no
company
at
all
the
boy
had
spoken
a
word
since
he
started
rummaging
among
the
captain
books
gloomily
he
snapped
on
the
screen
to
sample
the
soap
shows
della
pallas
was
in
jail
again
this
time
accused
of
murdering
the
lawyer
who
had
gotten
her
acquitted
on
a
previous
murder
rap
considering
the
fact
that
she
had
languished
in
jail
for
almost
a
year
during
the
other
trial
yetsko
felt
that
she
had
a
sound
motive
rudolf
barstow
in
broadway
wife
was
like
bruce
spider
spinning
his
five
hundredth
web
to
ensnare
the
glamorous
marie
knobble
and
there
was
a
show
about
a
schoolteacher
and
her
class
of
angelic
little
tots
that
almost
brought
yetsko
lunch
up
he
shifted
the
dial
again
a
young
literate
announcer
was
speaking
quickly
excitedly
scene
of
the
riot
already
the
worst
this
year
and
growing
steadily
worse
we
take
you
now
to
downtown
manhattan
where
our
portable
units
and
commentators
have
just
arrived
and
switch
you
to
ed
morgan
the
screen
went
black
and
yetsko
swore
angrily
ray
lifted
his
head
quickly
from
his
book
and
reached
for
the
sono
pistol
yetsko
had
given
him
good
afternoon
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
just
a
moment
until
we
can
give
you
the
picture
we
having
what
is
usually
labeled
as
technical
difficulties
in
this
case
the
difficulty
of
avoiding
having
a
hole
shot
in
our
camera
or
in
your
commentator
head
yes
that
shooting
you
hear
there
somebody
using
an
auto
rifle
how
are
you
coming
steve
a
voice
muttered
something
which
two
centuries
ago
would
have
caused
an
scandal
in
the
whole
industry
well
till
steve
gets
things
fixed
up
a
brief
review
to
date
of
what
sure
to
go
down
in
history
as
the
battle
of
purchasers
paradise
huh
ray
fairly
shouted
the
book
forgotten
started
in
the
chinaware
department
as
a
relatively
innocent
brawl
and
spread
to
the
liquor
department
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
everybody
started
playing
rough
at
first
it
was
suspected
that
macy
gimbel
had
sent
a
goon
gang
around
to
break
up
pelton
fall
sale
but
when
the
former
concern
rallied
to
the
assistance
of
their
competitor
with
a
force
of
twenty
riflemen
that
began
to
look
less
likely
and
we
beginning
to
think
that
it
might
be
the
work
of
some
of
pelton
political
enemies
about
ten
minutes
ago
major
james
slater
of
the
literates
guards
arrived
with
two
hundred
of
his
men
to
protect
the
literates
on
duty
at
the
store
they
captured
the
entire
twelfth
floor
where
we
are
now
with
the
exception
of
the
ladies
lingerie
and
hosiery
departments
around
one
of
the
escalators
to
the
lower
floors
here
the
gang
who
started
the
riot
and
who
are
now
donning
white
hoods
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
various
other
factions
involved
have
thrown
up
barricades
of
counters
and
display
tables
and
are
fighting
bitterly
to
keep
control
of
the
escalator
head
ah
here
we
are
the
screen
lit
suddenly
and
they
were
looking
ray
over
shoulder
across
the
devastated
expanse
of
what
had
been
the
frocks
department
toward
lingerie
and
hosiery
which
seemed
to
have
been
thoroughly
looted
then
stripped
of
everything
that
could
be
used
to
build
a
barricade
seems
to
have
been
quite
a
number
of
heavy
just
landed
on
the
east
stage
filled
with
more
goons
probably
to
the
gang
back
of
that
barricade
the
firing
gotten
noticeably
heavier
yetsko
had
turned
from
the
screen
and
was
pawing
in
the
arms
locker
for
a
job
like
this
he
need
firepower
he
took
the
clip
from
the
butt
of
his
pistol
and
inserted
one
with
a
curling
drum
at
the
bottom
and
shoved
two
more
like
it
into
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
and
now
something
to
clear
the
way
with
he
took
out
a
length
of
weighted
fire
hose
then
he
saw
ray
that
kid
was
pinning
him
down
here
while
the
captain
was
probably
fighting
for
his
life
but
the
captain
told
him
to
stay
with
ray
he
dropped
the
weighted
hose
what
the
matter
doug
the
boy
asked
pick
it
up
and
let
get
going
he
shook
his
head
ca
the
captain
told
me
i
had
to
take
care
of
you
the
boy
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
closed
it
again
and
thought
for
a
moment
then
he
asked
doug
did
captain
prestonby
tell
you
to
stay
with
me
yes
all
right
you
do
just
that
because
i
going
to
help
claire
and
the
senator
that
who
that
goon
gang
after
yetsko
considered
the
proposition
for
a
moment
horrified
why
this
was
the
captain
girl
kid
brother
if
anything
happened
to
him
his
mind
refused
to
contemplate
what
the
captain
would
do
to
him
no
you
got
ta
stay
here
ray
he
said
the
captain
then
his
eye
caught
the
screen
ed
morgan
must
have
found
a
place
where
he
could
run
his
camera
up
on
an
extension
rod
from
behind
something
they
were
looking
down
from
almost
ceiling
height
at
the
barricade
and
at
the
literates
guards
who
were
firing
from
cover
at
it
a
sudden
blast
of
burst
from
the
barricade
more
men
in
white
hoods
came
boiling
up
the
escalator
and
they
all
rushed
forward
the
few
literates
guards
skirmishers
were
overwhelmed
he
saw
one
of
them
a
man
he
knew
sam
igoe
from
company
go
down
wounded
he
saw
one
of
the
goons
pause
to
brain
him
with
a
carbine
butt
before
charging
on
why
you
dirty
rotten
illiterate
he
roared
retrieving
his
weighted
hose
come
on
ray
let
go
ray
hesitated
as
though
in
thought
ken
dorchin
harry
cobb
dick
hirschfield
jerry
mccarty
ramon
nogales
pete
shawne
tom
hutchinson
who
yetsko
began
what
they
got
ta
do
with
we
need
a
gang
the
two
of
us
last
about
as
long
as
a
pint
of
beer
at
a
dutch
picnic
ray
went
to
the
desk
grabbed
a
pen
and
made
a
list
of
names
in
a
fair
imitation
of
ralph
prestonby
neat
give
this
to
the
girl
outside
and
tell
her
to
have
them
called
for
and
sent
in
here
the
boy
directed
and
see
if
you
can
find
us
some
transport
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
couple
of
big
finished
down
at
the
shops
and
if
you
can
find
a
couple
more
literates
guards
you
can
talk
into
going
with
us
yetsko
nodded
and
took
the
paper
without
question
he
was
not
and
he
would
be
the
first
to
admit
it
of
the
thinking
type
he
was
a
good
sergeant
but
he
had
to
have
an
officer
to
tell
him
what
to
do
ray
pelton
might
be
only
fifteen
years
old
but
his
sister
was
the
captain
girl
and
that
put
him
in
the
officer
class
a
very
young
and
second
lieutenant
say
but
definitely
an
officer
yetsko
took
the
list
and
looked
at
it
like
most
guards
he
could
read
after
a
fashion
he
recognized
the
names
the
boys
were
all
members
of
the
top
floor
secret
society
he
went
out
and
gave
the
list
to
martha
collins
he
expected
some
argument
with
her
but
she
seemed
to
accept
ray
pelton
printing
as
prestonby
she
began
checking
room
charts
and
class
lists
and
calling
for
the
boys
to
be
sent
at
once
to
the
office
he
went
out
and
down
to
the
repair
shop
where
he
found
that
a
big
air
truck
that
the
senior
class
had
been
working
on
for
several
weeks
was
finished
that
thing
been
tested
yet
he
asked
the
instructor
yes
i
had
it
up
myself
this
morning
flew
it
over
to
the
bronx
and
back
with
a
load
of
supplies
have
somebody
you
can
trust
one
of
your
guards
preferably
bring
it
around
behind
the
administration
wing
captain
prestonby
wants
it
i
to
take
some
boys
from
fourth
year
civics
on
a
tour
something
about
election
campaign
methods
the
instructor
called
a
literates
guard
and
gave
him
instructions
yetsko
went
to
the
guards
squad
room
on
the
second
floor
where
he
found
half
a
dozen
of
the
reserves
loafing
all
right
you
guys
start
earning
your
pay
he
said
we
going
to
a
party
the
men
got
to
their
feet
and
began
gathering
their
weapons
mason
he
continued
you
have
your
big
here
the
gang
of
you
can
all
get
in
it
i
taking
off
in
a
truck
with
some
of
these
kids
i
want
you
boys
to
follow
us
we
going
to
store
there
a
fight
going
on
there
and
the
captain
in
the
middle
of
it
we
got
ta
get
him
out
they
all
looked
at
him
in
puzzled
surprise
but
nobody
gave
him
any
argument
funny
now
that
he
thought
of
it
it
had
been
quite
a
long
time
since
anybody
had
ever
given
him
any
argument
about
anything
a
couple
of
guys
out
in
pittsburgh
had
tried
it
but
somehow
they
lost
interest
in
arguing
after
a
little
when
he
returned
to
the
office
and
opened
the
door
a
blast
of
shots
greeted
him
through
the
open
door
of
prestonby
private
office
he
had
his
pistol
out
before
he
realized
that
the
shooting
was
going
on
at
pelton
purchasers
paradise
ten
miles
away
literate
martha
collins
in
the
inner
room
was
fairly
screaming
shut
that
infernal
thing
off
and
listen
to
me
the
boys
whom
ray
had
recruited
for
the
improvised
were
pulling
weapons
out
of
the
gun
locker
pawing
through
the
boxes
on
the
ammunition
shelf
trying
to
explain
to
one
another
the
working
of
machine
carbines
and
burp
guns
yetsko
shouldered
through
them
and
turned
down
the
sound
volume
of
the
tv
this
is
absolutely
outrageous
literate
martha
collins
stormed
at
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
taking
these
children
to
a
murderous
battle
like
that
well
maybe
it
ai
right
using
savages
in
a
civilized
riot
yetsko
admitted
but
i
do
care
the
captain
in
a
jam
and
use
live
devils
if
i
could
catch
a
few
he
took
a
burp
gun
from
one
of
the
boys
who
had
opened
the
action
and
could
get
it
closed
again
here
you
kids
do
want
this
kinda
stuff
he
reproved
sono
guns
and
guns
that
all
right
but
these
things
are
killing
tools
it
what
we
have
to
use
doug
ray
told
him
things
have
been
happening
since
you
went
out
look
at
the
screen
yetsko
looked
and
swore
blisteringly
then
he
gave
the
burp
gun
back
to
the
boy
look
you
got
ta
press
this
little
gismo
here
to
let
the
action
shut
when
there
no
clip
in
or
when
the
clip
empty
when
you
got
a
loaded
clip
in
you
just
pull
back
on
this
and
let
go
frank
cardon
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
as
it
had
been
ten
seconds
before
when
he
had
last
looked
he
started
to
drum
nervously
on
his
chair
arm
with
his
fingers
then
caught
himself
as
he
saw
lancedale
who
must
have
been
every
bit
as
anxious
as
himself
standing
outwardly
calm
and
unruffled
well
that
the
situation
which
now
confronts
us
brother
literates
the
slender
man
was
finishing
you
must
see
by
now
that
the
policy
of
unyielding
opposition
which
some
of
you
have
advocated
and
pursued
is
futile
you
know
the
policy
i
favor
which
now
remains
the
only
policy
we
can
follow
it
is
summed
up
in
that
law
of
political
strategy
if
you
ca
lick
join
and
after
joining
take
control
in
spite
of
the
victory
in
this
state
at
election
it
will
not
be
possible
in
the
next
congress
to
enact
pelton
socialized
literacy
program
into
law
the
radicals
will
not
be
able
to
capture
enough
seats
in
the
lower
house
and
there
are
too
many
uncontested
seats
in
the
senate
now
held
by
but
and
this
is
inevitable
barring
some
unforeseen
accident
of
the
order
of
a
political
cataclysm
they
will
control
both
houses
of
congress
after
the
election
of
two
years
hence
and
we
can
also
be
sure
that
two
years
hence
chester
pelton
will
be
nominated
and
overwhelmingly
elected
president
of
the
consolidated
states
of
north
america
six
months
thereafter
the
socialized
literacy
program
will
be
the
law
of
the
land
so
we
have
until
to
make
our
preparations
i
would
estimate
that
if
we
do
not
destroy
ourselves
by
our
own
folly
in
the
meantime
we
should
two
years
thereafter
be
in
complete
if
secret
control
of
the
whole
consolidated
states
government
if
any
of
you
question
that
last
statement
you
can
merely
ask
yourselves
one
question
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
rational
can
illiterates
control
and
operate
a
system
of
socialized
literacy
who
but
literates
can
keep
such
a
program
from
disintegrating
into
complete
and
indescribable
confusion
i
do
ask
for
any
decision
at
this
time
i
do
not
ask
for
any
debate
at
this
time
let
each
of
us
consider
the
situation
in
his
or
her
own
mind
and
let
us
meet
again
a
week
from
today
to
consider
our
future
course
of
action
each
of
us
realizing
that
any
decision
we
take
then
will
determine
forever
the
fate
of
our
fraternities
he
looked
around
the
room
thank
you
brother
literates
he
said
instantly
cardon
was
on
his
feet
with
a
motion
to
recess

with
a
little
from

cardon
pulled
out
the
ear
plug
stuffed
the
recorder
into
his
trouser
pocket
and
began
unbuckling
his
sam
browne
as
he
ran
for
the
nearest
wall
visiphone
he
was
dialing
the
guard
room
on
that
floor
with
one
hand
as
he
took
off
the
belt
get
a
big
ambulance
on
the
roof
with
a
literate
medic
and
he
ordered

he
threw

the
guard

pancho

away
for
me
thanks
he
tossed
the
last
word
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
ran
for
the
escalator
illustration
it
was
three
eternal
minutes
after
he
had
reached
the
landing
stage
above
before
the
ambulance
arrived
medic
and
orderly
on
the
front
seat
and
the
four
guards
all
in
conservatively
cut
civilian
clothes
inside
he
crowded
in
beside
the
medic
told
him
pelton
store
and
snapped
the
door
shut
as
the
big
white
began
to
rise
they
climbed
to
five
thousand
feet
and
then
the
driver
nosed
his
vehicle
up
cut
his
propeller
and
retracted
it
and
fired
his
rocket
aiming
toward
downtown
manhattan
four
minutes
later
after
the
rocket
stopped
firing
and
they
were
on
the
of
their
trajectory
the
propeller
was
erected
and
they
began
letting
down
toward
the
central
landing
stage
of
pelton
purchasers
paradise
cardon
cut
in
the
tv
and
began
calling
the
control
tower
ambulance
to
evacuate
pelton
he
called
what
the
score
down
there
one
of
pelton
men
appeared
on
cardon
screen
you
safe
to
land
on
the
central
stage
but
you
better
come
in
at
a
long
angle
from
the
north
he
said
we
control
the
north
public
stage
but
the
east
and
south
stages
are
in
the
hands
of
the
goons
they
fire
on
you
land
beside
that
big
pile
of
boxes
under
tarpaulins
up
here
but
be
careful
it
fireworks
we
did
have
time
to
get
into
storage
the
ambulance
came
slanting
in
from
uptown
and
cardon
looked
around
anxiously
the
dance
of
customers
had
stopped
there
was
a
sabbath
stillness
about
the
big
store
at
least
visually
a
few
small
figures
in
literates
guards
black
leather
moved
about
on
the
north
landing
stage
and
several
pelton
employees
were
on
the
central
stop
stage
the
howling
of
the
propeller
overhead
effectively
blocked
out
any
sounds
that
might
be
coming
from
the
building
at
least
until
the
ambulance
landed
then
a
spatter
of
firing
from
below
was
audible
cardon
the
medic
and
the
guards
piled
out
the
latter
with
the
stretcher
the
got
out
his
tablet
pistol
and
checked
the
chamber
then
settled
into
a
posture
of
watchful
relaxation
major
slater
was
waiting
for
them
by
one
of
the
vertical
lift
platforms
i
tried
to
get
hold
of
you
but
that
blasted
meeting
was
going
on
and
they
had
the
doors
sealed
and
he
began
cardon
hushed
him
quickly
around
here
i
an
illiterate
he
warned
where
pelton
we
got
to
get
him
and
his
daughter
out
of
here
at
once
he
still
flat
on
his
back
out
cold
slater
said
the
medic

around
here
gave
him
a
shot
of
hypnotaine
he
be
out

a
couple
of
hours
yet
prestonby
still
here
he
commanding
the
defense
doing
a
good

good
ralph

help
get
claire
to
literates
hall
after
they
gotten
her
father

safety
there
must
be
about
five
hundred
storm
troopers

of
them

here
after
we
did
the
city
cops
have
all
the
street
approaches
roped
off
they
letting
nobody
but
grant
hamilton
thugs
in
they
were
fairly
friendly
this
morning
cardon
said
mayor
jameson
must
have
passed
the
word
they
all
got
off
the
lift
two
floors
down
where
they
found
claire
pelton
and
ralph
prestonby
waiting
hello
ralph
claire
what
the
situation
we
have
all
the
twelfth
floor
prestonby
said
we
have
about
half
the
eleventh
including
the
north
and
west
public
stages
we
have
the
basement
and
the
storerooms
and
the
warehouse
sergeant
down
there
with
as
many
of
the
store
police
and
literates
and
literates
guards
and
as
he
could
salvage
and
the
warehouse
gang
they
taken
most
of
the
ground
floor
the
main
mezzanine
and
parts
of
the
second
floor
we
moved
two
of
the
machine
guns
down
from
the
top
and
we
control
the
front
street
entrance
with
them
and
a
couple
of
sono
guns
the
store
isolated
from
the
outside
by
the
city
police
who
are
allowing
to
come
through
for
the
raiders
but
we
managing
to
stop
them
at
the
doors
have
you
called
headquarters
for
help
yes
half
a
dozen
times
there
some
fellow
named
yingling
there
who
says
that
all
their
storm
troops
are
over
in
north
jersey
on
some
kind
of
a
and
ca
be
contacted
so
cardon
commented
gently
that
too
bad
now
too
bad
for
horace
yingling
and
joe
west
this
time
tomorrow
they
be
a
pair
of
dead
traitors
he
thought
well
we
have
to
make
do
with
what
we
have
where
russ
latterman
by
the
way
prestonby
gave
a
sidewise
glance
toward
claire
and
shook
his
head
his
lips
pressed
tightly
together
does
know
cardon
interpreted
down
in
the
basement
with
coccozello
prestonby
said
aloud
in
telephone
communication
with
coccozello
and
have
a
freight
elevator
running
between
here
and
the
basement
coccozello
says
latterman
is
using
a
rifle
against
the
raiders
killing
every
one
he
can
get
a
shot
at
cardon
nodded
probably
vindictive
about
being
involved
in
action
injurious
to
pelton
commercial
interests
just
another
odd
quirk
of
literate
ethics
we
better
get
him
up
here
he
said
you
and
i
have
got
to
leave
at
once
we
have
to
get
pelton
and
claire
to
safety
he
can
help
major
slater
till
we
can
get
back
with
i
am
going
to
kill
a
man
named
horace
yingling
and
then
i
going
to
round
up
the
storm
troops
he
diverted
on
a
chase
to
north
jersey
he
nodded
to
the
medic
and
the
four
guards
get
pelton
on
the
stretcher
better
use
the
canvas
flaps
and
the
straps
he
under
hypnotaine
but
it
likely
to
be
a
rough
trip
claire
get
anything
you
want
to
take
with
you
ralph
will
take
you
where
you
be
safe
for
a
while
but
the

claire
began
your
father

they
doubled
the
premium
on
him
when
he
came
out
for
senate
let
the
insurance
company
worry
about
the
store
the
medic
and
the
guards
moved
into
chester
pelton
private
rest
room
with
the
stretcher
claire
went
to
the
desk
and
began
picking
up
odds
and
ends
including
the
pistol
cardon
had
given
her
and
putting
them
in
her
handbag
we
got
to
keep
her
away
from
her
father
for
a
few
days
ralph
he
told
prestonby
softly
it
all
over
town
that
she
can
read
and
write
we
got
to
give
him
a
chance
to
cool
off
before

her
to
lancedale
i
have
everything
fixed
up
she

admitted
to
the
fraternities
this
afternoon
and
given
literate
protection
prestonby
grabbed
his
hand
impulsively
frank
i
never
be
able
to
repay
you
for
this
not
if
i
live
to
be
a
thousand
he
began
there
was
a
sudden
blast
of
sound
from
overhead
the
banging
of
machine
guns
the
bark
of
the
store
the
howling
of
airplane
jets
and
the
crash
of
explosions
everybody
in
the
room
jerked
up
and
stood
frozen
then
prestonby
jumped
for
the
and
pawed
at
the
dials
a
moment
later
after
the
screen
flashed
and
went
black
twice
they
were
looking
across
the
topside
landing
stage
from
a
pickup
at
one
corner
a
slim
with
backswept
wings
was
jetting
up
in
almost
perpendicular
flight
another
was
coming
in
toward
the
landing
stage
and
as
they
watched
a
flight
of
rockets
leaped
forward
from
under
its
wings
cardon
saw
the
of
the
ambulance
jump
down
and
start
to
run
for
the
open
he
got
five
steps
away
from
his
vehicle
then
the
rockets
came
in
and
one
of
them
struck
the
pile
of
boxes
beside
the
ambulance
there
was
a
flash
of
multicolored
flame
in
which
the
man
and
the
vehicle
he
had
left
both
vanished
immediately
the
screen
went
black
the
fireworks
had
mostly
exploded
at
the
first
blast
however
when
cardon
and
major
slater
and
one
or
two
others
reached
the
top
landing
stage
there
were
still
explosions
a
thing
the
size
and
shape
of
a
kettle
covered
with
red
paper
came
rolling
toward
them
and
suddenly
let
go
with
a
flash
throwing
a
column
of
smoke
in
miniature
imitation
of
an
into
the
air
something
about
three
feet
long
came
whizzing
at
them
on
the
end
of
a
tail
of
fire
causing
them
to
fling
themselves
flat
involuntarily
head
jerked
about
and
his
eyes
followed
it
until
it
blew
up
with
a
flash
and
a
bang
three
blocks
uptown
here
and
there
colored
fire
flared
small
rockets
flew
about
and
firecrackers
popped
the
ambulance
was
gone
blown
clear
off
the
roof
the
other
on
the
landing
stage
were
a
tangled
mass
of
wreckage
the
was
toppled
over
the
gunner
was
dead
and
one
of
the
crew
was
trying
to
drag
a
third
man
from
under
the
overturned
gun
the
control
tower
with
the
two
machine
guns
was
wrecked
the
two
that
had
been
left
on
the
top
had
vanished
along
with
the
machine
gunners
in
a
hole
that
had
been
blown
in
the
landing
stage
cardon
slater
and
the
others
dashed
forward
and
pulled
the
off
the
injured
man
hauling
him
and
his
companion
over
to
the
lift
the
two
were
returning
spraying
the
roof
with
bullets
and
behind
them
came
a
procession
of
fifteen
big
they
dropped
the
lift
hastily
slater
jumped
off
when
it
was
still
six
feet
above
the
floor
and
began
shouting
orders
falk
take
ten
men
and
get
to
the
head
of
this
burdick
levine
get
as
many
men
as
you
can

thirty
seconds
and
get
up
to
the
head
of
the
escalator
diaz
go
down
and
tell
sternberg
to
bring
all
his
gang
up
here
cardon
caught
up
a
rifle
and
rummaged
for
a
bandolier
of
ammunition
losing
about
a
minute
in
the
search
the
delay
was
fortunate
when
he
got
to
the
escalators
he
was
met
by
a
rush
of
men
hurrying
down
the
ascending
spiral
or
jumping
over
onto
the
descending
one
sono
guns
one
of
them
was
shouting
they
have
the
escalator
head
covered
you
get
knocked
out
before
you
get
off
the
spiral
he
turned
and
looked
toward
the
freight
lift
it
was
coming
down
again
with
falk
and
his
men
unconscious
on
it
knocked
senseless
by
bludgeons
of
inaudible
sound
and
a
half
a
dozen
of
the
raiders
all
wearing
the
white
robes
and
hoods
of
the
storm
troops
he
swung
his
rifle
up
and
began
squeezing
the
trigger
remembering
to
first
make
sure
that
the
lever
was
set
forward
for
semiauto
and
remembering
his
advice
to
goodkin
that
morning
by
the
time
the
platform
had
stopped
all
the
men
in
white
robes
were
either
dead
or
wounded
and
none
of
the
unconscious
literates
guards
along
with
them
had
been
injured
the
medic
who
had
come
with
cardon
assisted
by
a
couple
of
the
office
force
got
the
casualties
sorted
out
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
the
men
who
had
been
in
half
an
hour
or
so
they
would
recover
consciousness
with
no
ill
effects
that
a
couple
of
headache
tablets
would
set
right
the
situation
while
bad
was
not
immediately
desperate
if
the
raiders
controlled
the
top
landing
stage
they
were
pinned
down
by
the
firearms
and
sono
guns
of
the
defenders
below
who
were
in
a
position
to
stop
anything
that
came
down
the
escalators
or
the
lift
shaft
the
fate
of
the
first
party
was
proof
of
that
and
the
very
magnitude
of
the
riot
guaranteed
that
somebody
on
the
outside
city
police
state
guards
or
even
consolidated
states
regulars
would
be
taking
a
hand
shortly
the
air
attack
and
on
the
roof
had
been
excellent
tactics
but
it
had
been
a
serious
as
long
as
the
disturbance
had
been
confined
to
the
interior
of
the
store
the
city
police
could
shrug
it
off
as
another
minor
riot
on
property
supposed
to
be
protected
by
private
police
and
do
nothing
about
it
the
on
the
top
landing
stage
and
the
spectacular
explosion
of
the
fireworks
temporarily
stored
there
however
was
something
that
simply
could
be
concealed
or
dismissed
the
cloud
of
varicolored
smoke
alone
must
have
been
visible
all
over
the
five
original
boroughs
of
the
older
new
york
and
there
were
probably
rumors
of
going
around
what
gets
me
slater
who
must
have
been
thinking
about
the
same
thing
said
to
cardon
is
where
they
got
hold
of
those
two
that
kind
of
stuff
is
supposed
to
be
in
private
hands
a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
they
had
something
they
called
the
sullivan
law
cardon
told
him
private
citizens
were
even
allowed
to
own
pistols
but
the
gangsters
and
hoodlums
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
all
the
pistols
they
wanted
and
burp
guns
too
i
know
of
four
or
five
racket
gangs
in
this
area
that
have
aircraft
like
that
based
up
in
the
adirondacks
at
secret
fields
anybody
who
has
connections
with
one
of
those
gangs
can
order
an
air
attack
like
this
on
an
hour
notice
if
he
able
to
pay
for
it
what
i
understand
is
the
doing
anything
like
this
the
facts
about
this
business
will
be
all
over
the
state
before
the
polls
open
tomorrow
he
snapped
his
fingers
suddenly
come
on
let
have
a
look
at
those
fellows
who
came
down
on
the
lift
there
were
two
dead
men
in
white
robes
and
hoods
lying
where
they
had
been
dragged
from
the
lift
platform
cardon
pulled
off
the
hoods
and
zipped
open
the
white
robes
one
of
the
men
was
a
complete
stranger
the
other
however
was
a
man
he
had
seen
earlier
in
the
day
at
the
manhattan
headquarters
of
the
party
one
of
the
consolidated
organization
people
a
follower
of
west
and
yingling
so
that
how
it
was
he
said
straightening
now
i
get
it
go
see
if
any
of
those
wounded
goons
are
in
condition
to
be
questioned
ray
pelton
and
doug
yetsko
had
their
heads
out
an
open
window
on
the
right
side
of
the
cab
of
the
truck
ray
was
pointing
down
that
roof
over
there
looks
like
a
good
place
to
land
he
said
we
can
get
down
the
fire
escape
and
the
hatch
to
the
conveyor
belt
is
only
half
a
block
away
yetsko
nodded
there
be
a
watchman
or
a
private
cop
in
the
building
on
which
ray
intended
landing
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
would
take
care
of
him
and
they
could
leave
two
of
mason
boys
with
the
vehicles
to
see
that
he
stayed
bribed
sure
we
can
get
in
on
the
freight
conveyor
he
asked
maybe
be
guarded
then
we
have
to
crawl
in
through
the
cable
conduit
ray
said
i
done
that
lots
of
times
so
have
most
of
the
other
guys
he
nodded
toward
the
body
of
the
truck
behind
where
his
recruits
were
riding
i
played
all
over
the
store
ever
since
i
been
big
enough
to
walk
i
must
know
more
about
it
than
anybody
but
the
guy
who
built
it
that
why
i
said
we
have
to
bring
bullet
guns
down
where
we
going
we
gas
ourselves
with
gas
guns
and
if
we
used
sono
guns
we
knock
ourselves
out
with
the
echo
you
know
ray
you
make
a
real
storm
trooper
yetsko
said
if
you
manage
to
stay
alive
for
another
ten
years
you
be
almost
as
good
a
storm
troop
captain
as
captain
prestonby
that
ray
knew
was
about
as
high
praise
as
doug
yetsko
could
give
anybody
he
have
liked
to
ask
doug
more
about
captain
prestonby
doug
could
never
seem
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
his
officer
being
a
schoolteacher
but
there
was
no
time
the
truck
was
already
settling
onto
the
roof
the
watchman
proved
amenable
to
reason
he
took
one
look
at
yetsko
with
three
feet
of
weighted
fire
hose
in
his
hand
and
gulped
then
accepted
the
two
yetsko
gave
him
they
left
a
couple
of
literates
guards
with
the
vehicles
and
ray
led
the
way
to
the
fire
escape
and
down
into
the
alley
a
few
hundred
feet
away
there
was
an
iron
grating
which
they
pulled
up
ray
drew
the
pistol
he
had
gotten
out
of
captain
prestonby
arms
locker
and
checked
the
magazine
chamber
and
safety
knowing
that
yetsko
and
the
other
guards
were
watching
him
critically
and
then
started
climbing
down
the
ladder
the
conduit
was
halfway
down
yetsko
climbing
behind
him
examined
it
with
his
flashlight
probably
wondering
how
he
was
going
to
fit
himself
into
a
hole
like
that
they
climbed
down
onto
the
concrete
walkway
beside
the
conveyor
belts
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
overhead
lamps
ray
could
see
that
the
two
broad
belts
to
and
from
the
store
were
empty
for
as
far
as
he
could
see
in
either
direction
normally
there
should
be
things
moving
constantly
in
both
directions
big
wire
baskets
full
of
parcels
for
delivery
and
trash
containers
going
out
and
bales
and
crates
and
cases
of
merchandise
and
empty
delivery
baskets
and
trash
containers
coming
in
he
pointed
this
out
to
yetsko
sure
the
big
literates
guards
sergeant
nodded
they
got
control
of
the
opening
from
the
terminal
and
they
probably
got
a
gang
up
at
the
other
end
too
he
shouted
over
the
noise
of
the
conveyor
belts
i
hope
they
have
got
into
the
basement
of
the
store
if
they
have
i
know
a
way
to
get
in
ray
told
him
you
better
stay
here
for
about
five
minutes
and
let
me
scout
ahead
we
want
to
run
into
a
big
gang
of
them
ahead
yetsko
shook
his
head
no
ray
the
captain
told
me
i
was
to
stick
with
you
i
go
along
with
you
and
we
better
take
another
of
these
kids
for
a
runner
in
case
we
have
to
send
word
back
ramon
you
come
with
us
ray
said
the
rest
of
you
stay
here
for
five
minutes
and
then
if
you
do
hear
from
us
follow
us
mason
you
take
over
yetsko
told
the
guards
corporal
and
keep
an
eye
out
behind
you
we
in
a
sandwich
here
they
behind
us
and
in
front
of
us
if
anything
comes
at
you
from
behind
send
the
kids
forward
to
the
next
conduit
port
ray
and
yetsko
and
ramon
nogales
started
forward
halfway
to
the
next
conduit
port
there
was
a
smear
of
lubricating
oil
on
the
concrete
and
in
it
and
away
from
it
in
the
direction
of
the
store
they
found
footprints
it
was
ramon
nogales
who
noticed
the
oil
on
the
ladder
to
the
next
conduit
port
you
stick
here
yetsko
told
him
and
when
mason
and
the
others
come
up
hold
them
here
tell
mason
to
send
one
of
the
guards
forward
and
use
the
rest
of
the
gang
to
grab
anybody
who
comes
out
come
on
ray
at
the
port
beyond
they
halted
waiting
for
mason
man
to
come
up
they
lost
some
time
thereafter
but
they
learned
that
the
section
of
conduit
between
the
two
ports
was
empty
and
that
the
main
telephone
line
to
the
store
had
been
cut
whoever
had
cut
it
had
gone
either
forward
or
back
away
from
the
store
a
little
farther
on
the
sound
of
shots
ahead
became
audible
over
the
clanking
and
rattling
of
the
conveyor
belts
well
i
guess
this
is
where
we
start
crawling
yetsko
said
your
father
people
seem
to
be
holding
the
store
basement
against
a
gang
in
the
conveyor
tunnel
one
of
the
boys
scouted
ahead
and
returned
to
report
that
they
could
reach
the
next
conduit
port
but
that
the
section
of
both
conveyor
belts
ahead
of
him
was
stopped
apparently
wedged
yetsko
stood
for
a
moment
grimacing
in
an
effort
to
reach
a
decision
i
like
to
just
go
forward
and
hit
them
from
behind
he
said
but
i
do
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
and
we
have
to
be
careful
shooting
into
them
that
we
did
shoot
up
your
father
gang
beyond
them
i
wish
well
let
go
through
the
conduit
then
ray
said
we
can
slide
down
a
branch
conduit
that
runs
a
power
line
into
the
basement
go
ahead
everybody
at
the
store
knows
me
and
they
do
know
you
they
might
shoot
you
before
they
found
out
you
were
a
friend
before
yetsko
could
object
he
started
up
the
ladder
yetsko
behind
him
and
the
others
following
at
the
next
conduit
port
they
could
hear
shooting
very
plainly
seeming
to
be
in
front
of
them
at
the
next
one
the
shooting
seemed
to
be
going
on
directly
under
them
in
the
tunnel
with
the
flashlight
yetsko
had
passed
forward
to
him
ray
could
see
that
the
dust
on
the
concrete
floor
of
the
by
passage
between
and
under
the
power
and
telephone
cables
was
undisturbed
a
little
farther
on
there
was
an
opening
on
the
left
and
a
power
cable
branched
off
downward
at
a
sharp
angle
overhead
ray
was
able
to
turn
about
and
get
his
feet
in
front
of
him
yetsko
had
to
crawl
on
until
he
had
passed
it
and
then
back
into
it
after
ray
had
entered
bracing
one
foot
on
either
side
ray
inched
his
way
down
the
slope
hoping
that
the
two
hundred
pound
weight
of
doug
yetsko
would
start
sliding
upon
him
ahead
he
could
hear
voices
he
drew
his
hands
and
feet
away
from
the
sides
of
the
branch
conduit
and
let
himself
slip
landing
in
a
heap
in
the
electricians
shop
above
the
furnace
rooms
two
men
who
had
been
working
at
a
bench
trying
to
assemble
a
mass
of
equipment
into
a
radio
whirled
snatching
weapons
ray
knew
both
of
them
sam
jacobowitz
and
george
nyman
who
serviced
the
store
communications
equipment
they
both
stared
at
him
swearing
in
amazement
all
right
doug
ray
called
out
we
in
bring
the
gang
down
frank
cardon
and
ralph
prestonby
were
waiting
at
the
door
when
it
opened
and
russell
latterman
emerged
a
rifle
slung
over
one
shoulder
cardon
stepped
forward
and
took
the
rifle
from
him
come
on
over
here
russ
he
said
and
do
do
anything
reckless
they
led
him
to
one
side
latterman
looked
from
one
to
the
other
apprehensively
licking
his
lips
it
all
right
we
not
going
to
hurt
you
russ
cardon
assured
him
we
just
want
a
few
facts
beside
rigging
that
business
with
bayne
and
almost
killing
chet
pelton
and
forcing
claire
to
blow
her
cover
how
much
did
you
have
to
do
with
this
business
and
who
put
you
up
to
it
prestonby
wanted
to
know
my
guess
is
joyner
and
graves
am
i
right
graves
latterman
said
joyner
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
did
know
anything
about
it
he
in
charge
of
the
retail
merchandising
section
and
any
action
like
this
would
be
unethical
since
pelton
is
a
client
of
the
retail
merchandising
section
all
graves
told
me
to
do
was
fix
up
a
situation
using
my
own
judgment
that
would
provoke
a
literate
strike
and
force
either
claire
or
frank
here
to
betray
literacy
but
i
had
no
idea
that
it
would
involve
a
riot
like
this
if
i
had
i
have
stood
on
literates
ethics
and
refused
to
have
any
part
in
it
that
about
how
i
thought
it
would
be
cardon
nodded
graves
probably
was
informed
by
literates
with
the
that
this
riot
was
planned
he
wanted
to
get
our
people
out
of
the
store
unfortunately
for
him
he
was
present
at
the
extemporary
meeting
that
reversed
bayne
action
in
calling
the
strike
he
handed
the
rifle
back
to
latterman
i
just
took
this
in
case
you
might
get
excited
before
i
could
explain
and
you
can
forget
about
the
opposition
to
pelton
we
had
a
meeting
right
after
noon
lancedale
gained
the
upper
hand
joyner
and
graves
are
now
the
plan
is
to
support
pelton
and
get
on
the
inside
of
the
socialized
literacy
program
when
it
enacted
i
still
think
that
a
suicidal
policy
latterman
said
but
not
as
suicidal
as
splitting
the
fraternities
and
trying
to
follow
two
policies
simultaneously
i
wonder
if
i
could
put
a
call
through
to
literates
hall
without
some
of
these
overhearing
me
you
been
out
of
touch
down
in
the
cellar
russ
prestonby
told
him
our
telephone
line
cut
and
the
radio
is
smashed
he
told
latterman
about
the
rocket
attack
on
the
control
tower
which
also
housed
the
store
telecast
station
so
we
sandwiched
here
one
gang
has
us
blocked
at
the
twelfth
floor
and
another
gang
up
on
the
roof
trying
to
get
down
at
us
from
above
and
we
no
way
to
communicate
with
the
outside
we
can
pick
up
the
regular
telecasts
but
nobody
outside
seems
to
be
paying
much
attention
to
us
there
a
lot
of
equipment
down
in
the
electricians
shop
latterman
said
maybe
we
could
rig
up
a
sending
set
that
could
contact
one
of
the
telecast
stations
outside
that
an
idea
prestonby
said
let
see
what
we
can
do
about
it
they
went
into
pelton
office
the
store
owner
was
still
lying
motionless
on
his
stretcher
claire
was
fiddling
with
a
telecast
receiving
set
she
had
just
tuned
out
a
lecture
on
home
beautifications
and
had
gotten
the
of
a
serial
in
which
three
couples
were
somewhat
confused
over
just
who
was
married
to
whom
nobody
seems
to
realize
what
happening
to
us
she
said
turning
the
knob
again
then
she
froze
as
elliot
mongery
this
time
sponsored
by
parc
the
miracle
cleanser
appeared
on
the
screen
and
it
seems
that
the
attack
on
chester
pelton
has
picked
up
new
complications
somebody
seems
determined
to
wipe
out
the
whole
pelton
family
because
only
ten
minutes
ago
some
twenty
armed
men
invaded
the
mineola
high
school
where
pelton
son
raymond
is
a
student
and
forced
their
way
to
the
office
of
literate
first
class
ralph
prestonby
in
an
attempt
to
kidnap
young
pelton
neither
literate
prestonby
the
principal
nor
the
pelton
boy
who
was
supposed
to
be
in
his
office
could
be
found
the
raiders
were
put
to
flight
by
the
presence
of
mind
of
literate
martha
collins
who
pressed
the
button
which
turned
in
the
fire
alarm
filling
the
halls
with
a
mob
of
students
the
interlopers
fled
in
panic
after
being
set
upon
and
almost
mobbed
prestonby
looked
worried
i
left
ray
in
my
office
with
doug
yetsko
he
said
i
ca
understand
illustration
maybe
yetsko
got
a
tip
that
they
were
coming
and
got
ray
out
of
the
school
cardon
suggested
i
hope
he
took
him
home
he
caught
himself
just
in
time
to
avoid
mentioning
the
platoon
of
guards
at
the
pelton
home
which
he
was
not
supposed
to
know
about
do
worry
claire
if
anything
happened
to
ray
mongery
have
been
screaming
about
it
to
high
heaven
that
what
he
paid
to
do
well
i
stake
my
life
on
it
if
anybody
tried
to
do
anything
to
ray
while
yetsko
was
with
him
you
have
heard
about
it
prestonby
said
it
have
been
a
bigger
battle
than
this
one
ca
seem
to
find
out
anything
about
what
going
on
at
pelton
store
mongery
continued
telephone
and
radio
communication
seems
to
be
broken
and
although
there
is
continuous
firing
going
on
inside
the
building
the
city
police
who
have
a
cordon
completely
around
it
say
that
the
situation
in
the
store
is
well
in
hand
considering
chester
pelton
attacks
on
the
city
administration
and
particularly
the
police
department
i
leave
to
your
imagination
what
they
mean
by
that
we
do
know
that
a
large
body
of
unidentified
whom
police
inspector
cassidy
claims
are
officers
are
holding
the
conveyor
line
into
the
store
at
the
downtown
manhattan
terminal
and
nobody
seems
to
know
what
going
on
at
the
other
end
they
have
the
sections
of
both
belts
at
the
store
entrance
end
wedged
latterman
said
coming
up
at
the
moment
coccozello
has
a
barricade
thrown
up
across
the
store
end
of
the
tunnel
and
they
have
a
barricade
about
fifty
yards
down
the
tunnel
that
where
i
was
fighting
when
you
called
me
up
anything
being
done
about
up
a
radio
prestonby
asked
yes
i
just
called
coccozello
latterman
said
fortunately
the
telephone
is
still
working
he
put
a
couple
of
men
to
work
and
thinks
he
may
have
a
set
in
operation
in
about
half
an
hour
and
if
as
i
much
fear
chester
pelton
has
been
murdered
then
i
advise
all
listening
to
me
to
go
to
the
polls
tomorrow
and
vote
the
straight
anarchist
ticket
if
we
got
to
have
anarchy
in
this
country
let
have
anarchy
for
all
and
not
just
for
grant
hamilton
and
his
political
adherents
mongery
was
saying
there
was
a
series
of
heavy
explosions
on
the
floor
above
everybody
grabbed
weapons
and
hurried
outside
crowding
onto
the
escalators
the
floor
above
was
a
shambles
with
bodies
lying
about
and
the
descending
escalator
was
packed
with
attackers
who
had
apparently
prepared
for
their
charge
by
tossing
down
a
number
of
heavy
fragmentation
bombs
cardon
had
a
burp
gun
this
time
he
emptied
the
magazine
into
the
hooded
hoodlums
who
were
coming
down
prestonby
beside
him
had
a
heavy
sono
gun
he
kept
it
trained
on
the
head
of
the
escalator
and
held
the
trigger
back
until
it
was
empty
then
slapped
in
a
fresh
clip
of
the
small
blank
cartridges
which
produced
the
sound
waves
that
were
amplified
and
altered
to
stunning
vibrations
still
many
of
the
attackers
got
through
more
were
dropping
down
the
shaft
ceased
firing
the
action
open
on
an
empty
clip
he
dropped
it
and
yanked
the
heavy
pistol
from
his
shoulder
holster
then
from
the
direction
of
the
freight
elevator
reinforcements
arrived
headed
by
a
huge
man
in
the
black
leather
of
the
guard
who
swung
a
length
of
fire
hose
with
his
right
hand
and
fired
a
pistol
with
his
left
and
a
boy
in
a
jacket
who
was
letting
off
a
burp
gun
in
deliberate
parsimonious
bursts
it
was
a
second
or
two
before
cardon
recognized
them
as
bodyguard
doug
yetsko
and
claire
pelton
brother
ray
there
were
four
literates
guards
and
about
a
dozen
boys
with
them
all
firing
with
a
variety
of
weapons
at
the
same
time
others
were
arriving
on
the
escalators
from
the
floors
below
firing
as
they
came
off
slater
literates
guards
the
literates
and
their
troopers
of
hopkinson
store
service
crew
the
fifteen
survivors
of
the
twenty
riflemen
from
macy
gimbel
the
attackers
turned
and
crowded
onto
the
ascending
escalator
most
of
them
got
away
the
casualties
being
carried
up
by
the
escalator
doug
yetsko
bounded
forward
and
brought
his
fire
hose
down
on
the
back
of
one
invader
neck
then
after
a
last
spatter
of
shots
from
the
defenders
there
was
silence
cardon
stepped
forward
and
yanked
the
hood
from
the
man
whom
yetsko
had
knocked
down
hoping
that
he
had
a
stunned
prisoner
who
could
be
interrogated
the
man
was
dead
however
with
a
broken
neck
for
a
moment
cardon
looked
down
at
the
heavy
brutal
features
of
joe
west
the
illiterates
organization
man
if
chester
pelton
got
out
of
this
mess
alive
and
won
the
election
tomorrow
there
was
going
to
have
to
be
a
purge
in
the
party
and
something
was
going
to
have
to
be
done
about
the
consolidated
organization
of
illiterates
he
turned
to
yetsko
you
and
your
gang
got
here
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
said
how
did
you
get
into
the
store
through
the
freight
conveyor
into
the
basement
but
i
thought
those
goons
had
both
ends
of
that
plugged
they
did
yetsko
grinned
but
ray
pelton
took
us
in
at
the
middle
and
we
crawled
through
a
cable
conduit
to
get
around
the
gang
at
this
end
cardon
looked
around
quickly
in
search
of
ray
the
boy
having
come
out
of
the
excitement
of
battle
was
looking
around
at
the
litter
of
dead
and
wounded
on
the
floor
his
eyes
widened
and
he
gulped
then
carefully
setting
the
safety
of
his
burp
gun
and
slinging
it
he
went
over
and
leaned
against
the
wall
and
was
sick
prestonby
with
claire
pelton
beside
him
started
toward
the
retching
boy
yetsko
put
out
a
hamlike
hand
to
stop
them
if
the
kid
wants
to
be
sick
let
him
be
sick
he
said
he
got
a
right
to
i
was
that
after
my
first
fight
but
he
wo
do
that
the
next
time
there
is
going
to
be
any
next
time
claire
declared
with
maternal
protectiveness
that
what
you
think
miss
claire
yetsko
told
her
that
gon
na
make
a
great
storm
trooper
he
declared
every
bit
as
great
as
captain
prestonby
here
claire
looked
up
at
prestonby
almost
worshipfully
and
i
never
knew
anything
about
your
being
a
till
today
she
said
ralph
there
so
much
about
you
that
i
do
know
there
be
plenty
of
time
to
find
out
now
honey
he
told
her
cardon
stepped
over
the
body
of
joe
west
and
went
up
to
them
sorry
to
intrude
on
you
two
he
said
but
we
got
to
figure
on
how
to
get
out
of
here
could
we
get
out
the
same
way
you
got
in
he
asked
yetsko
and
take
pelton
with
us
yetsko
frowned
part
of
the
way
we
got
ta
crawl
through
this
conduit
it
only
about
a
yard
square
and
we
have
to
go
up
a
ladder
and
out
a
manhole
to
get
out
of
the
conveyor
tunnel
what
sorta
pelton
in
he
under
hypnotaine
completely
unconscious
prestonby
said
then
we
have
to
drag
him
yetsko
said
strap
him
up
in
a
tarp
or
load
him
into
a
sleeping
bag
if
we
can
get
hold
of
one
there
are
plenty
down
in
the
warehouse
latterman
interrupted
joining
them
and
the
warehouse
is
in
our
hands
all
right
cardon
decided
we
take
him
out
now
and
take
him
home
i
have
some
men
there
who
take
care
of
him
we
have
to
get
you
and
ray
out
too
he
told
claire
i
think
we
take
both
of
you
to
literates
hall
you
be
absolutely
safe
there
but
the
store
claire
started
to
object
and
all
these
people
who
came
here
to
help
us
as
soon
as
i
have
your
father
home
i
going
to
start
rounding
up
a
gang
to
raise
the
siege
cardon
said
storm
troops
and
he
grinned
suddenly
the
insurance
company
the
one
that
has
the
store
insured
against
riot
why
did
i
think
of
them
before
they
losing
money
every
second
this
thing
goes
on
it
be
worth
their
while
to
start
doing
something
to
stop
it
the
trip
out
through
the
conduit
was
not
so
difficult
even
with
the
encumbrance
of
the
unconscious
chester
pelton
but
prestonby
was
convinced
that
except
for
the
giant
strength
of
doug
yetsko
it
would
have
been
nearly
impossible
ray
pelton
recovered
from
his
nausea
and
steeled
by
responsibility
went
first
cardon
crawled
after
him
followed
by
a
couple
of
the
boys
then
came
yetsko
dragging
the
sleeping
bag
in
which
chester
pelton
was
packed
like
a
mummy
prestonby
himself
followed
pushing
on
his
future
feet
and
claire
crawled
behind
with
the
rest
of
ray
schoolmates
for
a
rearguard
they
got
past
the
battle
which
was
still
going
on
at
the
entrance
to
the
store
basement
letting
pelton
down
with
a
rope
and
carrying
him
onto
the
belt
they
left
it
in
time
to
assemble
under
the
ladder
leading
to
the
alley
through
which
ray
said
they
had
entered
and
hauled
pelton
up
after
them
then
when
they
were
all
out
in
the
open
again
ray
ran
up
the
alley
and
mounted
a
fire
escape
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
big
truck
which
had
been
parked
on
the
roof
let
down
to
them
into
this
cardon
ordered
the
unconscious
senatorial
candidate
loaded
and
the
boys
who
had
come
with
ray
i
take
him
home
and
then
run
the
boys
to
the
school
he
told
prestonby
you
and
ray
and
claire
get
in
this
other
and
go
straight
to
literates
hall
he
pointed
up
to
the
passenger
vehicle
which
was
hovering
above
waiting
for
the
truck
to
leave
go
in
the
church
way
and
go
straight
to
lancedale
office
and
here
he
scribbled
an
address
and
a
phone
number
and
a
couple
of
names
these
men
have
my
at
this
address
call
them
as
soon
as
you
get
to
literates
hall
and
have
them
take
it
at
once
to
pelton
home
on
long
island
prestonby
nodded
and
watched
cardon
climb
into
the
truck
the
literates
guard
who
was
driving
lifted
it
up
and
began
windmilling
away
toward
the
east
the
passenger
driven
by
another
guard
from
the
school
settled
down
putting
ray
and
claire
into
it
he
climbed
in
after
them
ray
he
said
how
would
you
like
to
be
a
real
literate
ray
eyes
opened
you
think
i
good
enough
good
enough
to
be
a
novice
to
start
with
and
i
do
think
stay
a
novice
long
claire
looked
at
him
inquiringly
saying
nothing
you
too
honey
he
said
frank
fixed
it
all
up
you
and
ray
will
be
admitted
to
the
fraternities
this
afternoon
and
that
will
remove
any
objection
to
our
being
married
but
how
about
the
senator
she
asked
prestonby
shrugged
it
all
over
the
state
now
that
you
can
read
there
nothing
that
you
can
do
about
it
and
frank
has
a
lot
of
influence
with
him
he
talk
him
around
to
where
he
be
willing
to
make
the
best
of
it
in
a
week
or
so
russell
latterman
noticed
that
major
slater
was
looking
at
him
in
a
respectfully
inquiring
manner
he
said
nothing
and
at
length
the
literates
guards
officer
broke
the
silence
you
did
go
out
with
the
others
latterman
shook
his
head
no
major
i
an
executive
of
purchasers
paradise
however
unlike
its
name
it
may
look
at
the
moment
my
job
here
i
afraid
i
have
to
lean
pretty
heavily
on
you
until
cardon
can
get
help
to
us
i
not
particularly
used
to
combat
you
been
doing
all
right
with
that
rifle
slater
told
him
i
can
hit
what
i
aim
at
yes
but
i
not
used
to
commanding
men
in
combat
and
i
not
much
of
a
tactician
slater
thrust
out
his
hand
impulsively
i
took
a
sort
of
poor
view
of
you
at
first
i
sorry
he
said
want
me
to
take
command
if
you
please
major
what
are
you
going
to
do
after
this
thing
over
slater
asked
stay
on
with
pelton
provided
does
find
out
that
i
organized
that
trick
with
his
medicine
and
the
safe
latterman
said
since
lancedale
seems
to
have
gotten
on
top
at
the
hall
i
am
as
of
now
a
lancedale
partisan
that
partly
opportunism
and
it
partly
because
since
a
single
policy
has
been
adopted
i
feel
obliged
to
go
along
with
it
i
have
to
get
the
store
back
in
operation
as
soon
as
possible
pelton
going
to
need
money
badly
if
he
going
to
try
for
the
presidency
in
he
looked
around
him
you
know
always
wanted
to
run
a
fire
sale
this
be
even
better
a
battle
sale
cardon
watched
chester
pelton
apprehensively
as
the
merchant
and
senatorial
candidate
sipped
from
the
tall
glass
in
his
hand
and
then
set
it
on
the
table
beside
him
his
face
was
pale
and
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
hit
with
a
blackjack
that
an
awful
load
of
bricks
to
dump
on
a
man
all
at
once
frank
he
said
reproachfully
you
rather
i
told
you
now
than
turn
on
the
tv
and
hear
some
commentator
talking
about
it
would
you
cardon
asked
pelton
swore
vilely
in
a
lifeless
monotone
cursing
literacy
and
all
literates
back
to
the
invention
of
the
alphabet
then
he
stopped
short
no
frank
i
do
mean
that
either
my
own
son
and
daughter
are
literates
i
ca
say
that
about
them
but
how
long
oh
for
about
a
year
i
say
i
understand
now
that
they
were
admitted
to
the
fraternities
six
months
ago
he
invented
and
they
were
working
against
me
all
that
time
pelton
demanded
cardon
shook
his
head
no
chet
they
were
for
you
all
the
way
your
daughter
exposed
her
literacy
to
save
your
life
your
son
and
his
teacher
came
to
your
store
and
fought
for
you
but
there
are
literates
who
want
to
see
you
defeated
and
they
the
ones
who
made
that
secretly
of
the
ceremony
in
which
your
son
and
daughter
took
the
literates
oath
and
received
the
white
smock
and
going
to
telecast
it
this
evening
at
hundred
coming
on
top
of
the
stories
that
have
been
going
around
all
afternoon
and
slade
gardner
speech
this
morning
they
think
that
be
enough
to
defeat
you
well
do
you
pelton
gloomed
my
own
kids
literates
he
seemed
to
have
reached
a
point
at
which
he
was
actually
getting
a
masochistic
pleasure
out
of
turning
the
dagger
in
his
wounds
who
trust
me
after
this
no
chet
it
is
enough
to
beat
you
if
you
just
throw
away
that
crying
towel
and
start
fighting
they
made
one
mistake
that
going
to
wreck
them
what
that
frank
pelton
brightened
by
about
one
angstrom
unit
the
timing
of
course
cardon
told
him
impatiently
i
thought
you
see
that
at
once
this
telecast
comes
on
at
hundred
your
final
speech
comes
on
at
thirty
as
soon
as
shown
this
business
of
claire
and
ray
taking
the
literate
oath
be
on
the
air
yourself
and
if
you
put
on
any
kind
of
a
show
worth
the
name
it
wo
be
safe
for
anybody
in
this
state
to
be
caught
wearing
a
white
smock
now
if
they
only
had
the
wit
to
wait
till
after
you
delivered
that
speech
you
been
practicing
on
for
the
last
two
weeks
and
then
spring
this
on
you
that
would
have
been
different
they
have
had
you
over
a
barrel
but
this
way
you
have
them
pelton
took
another
gulp
from
the
tall
glass
at
his
elbow
emptying
it
fix
me
up
another
of
these
frank
he
said
i
feel
like
a
new
man
already
then
his
face
clouded
again
but
we
have
no
time
to
prepare
a
speech
now
and
i
just
ca
ad
lib
one
cardon
drew
a
little
from
his
pocket
case
play
this
off
he
said
i
had
it
fixed
up
as
soon
as
i
got
wise
to
what
was
going
to
happen
the
voice
is
one
of
the
girls
in
my
office
over
at
the
brewery
pronunciation
grammar
elocution
and
everything
correct
pelton
snapped
the
disk
onto
his
recorder
and
put
in
the
ear
plug
then
before
he
pressed
the
stud
he
looked
at
cardon
curiously
how
you
get
onto
this
anyhow
frank
he
wanted
to
know
well
i
hope
you
do
ask
me
for
an
accounting
of
all
the
money
i
been
spending
in
this
campaign
because
some
of
the
items
would
look
funny
as
hell
but
no
accounting
frank
after
all
you
spent
as
much
of
your
own
money
as
you
did
of
mine
pelton
interrupted
but
i
bought
myself
a
pipe
line
into
literates
hall
big
enough
to
chase
an
elephant
through
cardon
went
on
ignoring
the
interruption
this
fellow
mongery
for
instance
elliot
mongery
was
one
of
literate
frank
cardon
best
friends
he
comforted
his
conscience
with
the
knowledge
that
mongery
would
slander
him
just
as
unscrupulously
if
the
interests
of
the
lancedale
plan
were
at
stake
i
have
mongery
just
like
this
he
made
a
clutching
and
lifting
gesture
as
though
he
were
picking
up
some
small
animal
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
so
as
soon
as
i
got
word
of
it
i
started
getting
this
thing
together
it
is
the
kind
of
a
job
a
literate
semanticist
would
do
but
it
all
honest
illiterate
thinking
in
illiterate
language
turn
it
on
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
while
pelton
listened
to
the
record
cardon
mixed
him
another
of
the
highballs
adding
a
little
of
the
the
medic
had
given
him
pelton
was
grinning
savagely
when
he
turned
off
the
little
machine
and
took
out
the
ear
plug
great
stuff
frank
and
i
wo
have
to
ham
it
much
it
just
about
the
way
i
feel
he
thought
for
a
moment
you
have
me
talking
about
my
ruined
store
there
just
how
bad
is
it
anyhow
pretty
bad
chet
latterman
says
it
going
to
take
some
time
to
get
it
fixed
up
but
he
expects
to
be
open
for
business
by
thursday
or
friday
he
going
to
put
on
a
big
battle
sale
he
says
it
going
to
make
history
and
the
insurance
covers
most
of
the
damage
well
tell
me
about
it
how
did
you
get
the
riot
stopped
after
you
got
me
out
and
how
did
you
cardon
shook
his
head
you
play
that
record
over
again
get
yourself
in
the
mood
when
you
go
on
we
have
you
in
a
chair
wrapped
in
a
blanket
you
supposed
to
have
crawled
back
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
to
make
this
speech
and
we
have
the
wire
run
down
inside
the
blanket
so
that
you
can
listen
to
the
speech
while
you
giving
it
chet
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
great
political
speeches
of
all
time
literate
william
lancedale
looked
up
from
his
desk
and
greeted
his
visitor
with
a
smile
well
frank
sit
down
and
accept
congratulations
i
suppose
you
got
the
returns
cardon
nodded
dropping
into
a
chair
beside
the
desk
just
came
from
campaign
headquarters
this
automatic
tally
system
they
use
on
the
voting
machines
is
really
something
complete
returns
tabulated
and
reported
for
the
whole
state
within
forty
minutes
after
the
polls
closed
i
wo
be
silly
enough
to
ask
you
if
you
got
the
returns
i
deserved
that
of
course
lancedale
chuckled
can
i
offer
you
refreshment
a
nice
big
stein
of
cardon
black
bottle
for
instance
cardon
shuddered
and
grimaced
horribly
i
been
drinking
that
slop
by
the
bucketful
all
day
and
pelton
throwing
a
victory
party
tonight
and
i
have
to
choke
down
another
half
gallon
of
it
give
me
a
cup
of
coffee
and
one
of
those
good
cigars
of
yours
lancedale
grinned
at
him
ah
yes
the
jolly
brewer
his
own
best
advertisement
how
pelton
reacting
to
his
triumph
and
what
his
attitude
toward
his
children
i
been
worrying
about
that
vestigial
traces
of
a
conscience
i
suppose
well
i
had
to
keep
him
steamed
up
till
after
he
went
off
the
air
cardon
said
chet
is
a
very
good
actor
but
after
that
i
talked
to
him
like
a
dutch
uncle
told
him
what
a
swell
pair
of
kids
and
a
fine
he
had
he
got
sore
at
me
tried
to
throw
me
out
of
the
house
a
couple
of
times
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
have
another
of
those
attacks
but
by
the
time
ralph
and
claire
get
back
from
their
honeymoon
and
ray
finishes
that
for
literate
prep
school
he
be
ready
to
confer
the
paternal
blessing
all
around
i
going
to
stay
in
town
and
make
sure
of
it
and
then
taking
about
a
month
vacation
you
earned
it
all
right
lancedale
poured
cardon
coffee
and
passed
him
the
cigar
humidor
how
pelton
attitude
toward
the
consolidated
illiterates
organization
now
cardon
having
picked
up
the
italian
stiletto
to
puncture
his
cigar
looked
at
it
carefully
to
make
sure
that
it
really
had
no
edge
and
then
drew
it
quickly
across
his
throat
just
like
that
you
know
what
really
happened
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
store
do
you
well
in
general
yes
i
wish
you
fill
me
in
on
some
of
the
details
though
frank
details
he
wants
well
cardon
blew
on
his
coffee
and
sipped
it
the
way
we
played
it
for
propaganda
purposes
of
course
there
was
only
one
big
riot
and
it
was
all
the
work
of
the
wicked
literates
and
their
hirelings
actually
there
were
two
riots
first
there
was
one
the
independents
had
planned
for
about
a
week
in
advance
that
was
the
one
sforza
tipped
us
on
the
one
that
started
in
china
graves
knew
about
it
enough
to
advise
latterman
to
get
all
the
literates
out
of
the
store
before
noon
which
latterman
did
with
trimmings
then
there
was
another
riot
masterminded
by
a
couple
of
illiterates
organization
action
committee
people
named
joe
west
and
horace
yingling
both
deceased
that
was
the
result
of
bright
idea
to
trap
claire
me
into
betraying
literacy
these
illiterate
fanatics
made
up
their
minds
to
speak
rather
loosely
that
the
whole
pelton
family
were
literates
including
chet
himself
they
decided
that
it
was
better
to
kill
off
their
candidate
and
use
him
for
a
martyr
two
years
from
now
than
to
elect
him
and
have
him
sell
them
out
they
got
about
a
hundred
or
so
of
their
goons
dressed
in
kkk
costumes
bought
air
support
from
patsy
callazo
mob
up
in
vermont
and
made
that
attack
on
the
top
landing
stage
after
starting
a
fake
riot
in
north
jersey
to
draw
off
the
regular
storm
troops
incidentally
when
i
found
out
it
was
callazo
gang
that
furnished
those
fighter
bombers
i
hired
another
mob
to
go
up
and
drop
a
on
callazo
field
to
teach
him
to
keep
his
schnozzle
out
of
politics
lancedale
nodded
briskly
that
i
approve
of
how
about
west
and
yingling
prestonby
muscle
man
yetsko
killed
west
i
took
care
of
comrade
yingling
myself
after
i
gotten
reinforcements
to
the
store
first
a
couple
of
storm
troops
that
the
insurance
company
hired
and
then
as
many
of
the
radical
rangers
as
i
could
gather
up
and
pelton
knows
about
all
this
he
certainly
does
after
this
caper
the
illiterates
through
as
far
as
any
consideration
or
patronage
from
the
radicals
is
concerned
well
that
pretty
nearly
the
best
thing
i
heard
out
of
the
whole
business
lancedale
said
in
about
eight
or
ten
years
we
may
want
to
pull
the
party
together
again
to
cash
in
on
public
dissatisfaction
with
pelton
socialized
literacy
program
which
ought
to
be
coming
apart
at
the
seams
by
then
and
if
we
have
the
illiterates
split
into
two
hostile
factions
cardon
finished
his
coffee
well
chief
i
got
to
be
getting
along
can
only
cover
me
for
a
short
while
and
i
have
to
be
getting
to
this
victory
party
of
pelton
lancedale
rose
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
ca
tell
you
too
many
times
what
a
fine
job
you
did
frank
he
said
i
hope
no
knowing
you
i
positive
that
you
be
able
to
engineer
a
reconciliation
between
pelton
and
his
son
and
daughter
and
young
prestonby
and
then
have
yourself
a
good
vacation
i
mean
to
i
going
deer
hunting
to
a
place
up
in
the
mountains
along
the
old
york
state
line
a
little
community
of
about
a
thousand
people
where
everybody
men
women
and
children
can
read
lancedale
was
interested
a
community
of
literates
cardon
shook
his
head
not
just
people
who
can
read
and
write
he
replied
it
a
kind
of
sort
of
place
and
i
imagine
a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
the
community
was
too
poor
to
support
one
of
these
school
systems
that
made
illiterates
out
of
the
people
in
the
cities
probably
raise
enough
money
in
school
taxes
to
buy
all
the
expensive
equipment
so
they
had
to
use
textbooks
and
teach
the
children
to
read
from
them
they
have
radios
and
tv
of
course
but
they
also
have
a
little
daily
paper
and
they
have
a
community
library
lancedale
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
you
know
frank
there
must
be
quite
a
few
little
enclaves
of
like
that
in
and
mountain
communities
especially
in
the
west
and
the
south
i
going
to
make
a
project
of
finding
such
communities
helping
them
and
getting
recruits
from
them
they
fit
into
the
plan
well
i
be
seeing
you
some
time
tomorrow
i
suppose
he
watched
cardon
go
out
and
then
poured
a
glass
of
port
for
himself
and
sipped
slowly
holding
the
glass
to
the
light
and
watching
the
ruby
glow
it
cast
on
the
desk
top
it
had
been
over
thirty
years
ago
when
he
had
been
old
jules
de
chambord
assistant
that
the
plan
had
been
first
conceived
de
chambord
was
dead
these
twenty
years
and
he
had
taken
the
old
man
place
and
they
had
only
made
the
first
step
things
would
move
faster
now
but
he
would
still
die
before
the
plan
was
completed
and
frank
cardon
whom
he
had
marked
as
his
successor
would
be
an
old
man
and
somebody
like
young
ray
pelton
would
be
ready
to
replace
him
but
the
plan
would
go
on
until
everybody
would
be
literate
not
literate
and
illiteracy
not
illiteracy
would
be
a
mark
of
social
stigma
and
most
people
would
live
their
whole
lives
without
personal
acquaintance
with
an
illiterate
there
were
a
few
years
yet
to
prepare
for
the
next
step
the
white
smocks
would
have
to
go
literates
would
have
to
sacrifice
their
paltry
titles
and
distinctions
there
would
have
to
be
a
of
the
fraternities
wilton
joyner
and
harvey
graves
and
the
other
conservative
literates
would
have
to
be
convinced
emotionally
as
well
as
intellectually
of
the
need
for
change
there
were
a
few
of
the
older
brothers
who
could
never
adjust
their
thinking
they
would
have
to
be
promoted
to
positions
with
higher
salaries
and
more
impressive
titles
and
no
authority
whatever
but
that
was
all
a
matter
of
tactics
the
younger
men
like
frank
cardon
and
elliot
mongery
and
ralph
prestonby
could
take
care
of
that
certain
changes
would
occur
a
stable
and
peaceful
order
of
society
for
one
thing
a
rule
of
law
and
the
liquidation
of
these
goon
gangs
and
storm
troops
and
private
armies
if
a
beginning
at
that
were
made
tomorrow
using
the
battle
at
pelton
store
to
mobilize
public
opinion
it
would
still
take
two
decades
to
get
anything
really
significant
done
and
a
renaissance
of
technological
and
scientific
progress
today
the
manufacturers
changed
the
models
twice
a
year
and
except
for
altering
the
shape
of
a
few
excrescences
or
changing
the
contours
slightly
they
were
the
same
that
had
been
buzzing
over
the
country
at
the
time
of
the
third
world
war
every
month
the
pharmaceutical
companies
announced
a
new
wonder
drug
and
if
it
was
sulfa
it
was
penicillin
and
if
it
was
penicillin
it
would
be
aureomycin
why
most
of
the
scientific
research
was
being
carried
on
by
a
few
literates
in
the
basements
of
a
few
libraries
the
science
of
two
centuries
ago
he
sighed
and
finished
his
port
and
as
he
did
probably
once
every
six
months
he
the
glass
he
be
next
birthday
maybe
he
live
long
enough
to
see
the
end
