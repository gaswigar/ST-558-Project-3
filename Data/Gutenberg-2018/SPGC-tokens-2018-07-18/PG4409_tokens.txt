beauty
of
course
is
for
the
hero
nevertheless
it
is
not
always
he
on
whom
beauty
works
its
most
conquering
influence
it
is
the
dull
commonplace
man
into
whose
slow
brain
she
drops
like
a
celestial
light
and
burns
lastingly
the
poet
for
instance
is
a
connoisseur
of
beauty
to
the
artist
she
is
a
model
these
gentlemen
by
much
contemplation
of
her
charms
wax
critical
the
days
when
they
had
hearts
being
gone
they
are
haply
divided
between
the
blonde
and
the
brunette
the
aquiline
nose
and
the
proserpine
this
shaped
eye
and
that
but
go
about
among
simple
unprofessional
fellows
boors
dunderheads
and
here
and
there
you
shall
find
some
barbarous
intelligence
which
has
had
just
strength
enough
to
conceive
and
has
taken
beauty
as
its
goddess
and
knows
but
one
form
to
worship
in
its
poor
stupid
fashion
and
would
perish
for
her
nay
more
the
man
would
devote
all
his
days
to
her
though
he
is
dumb
as
a
dog
and
indeed
he
is
beauty
dog
almost
every
beauty
has
her
dog
the
hero
possesses
her
the
poet
proclaims
her
the
painter
puts
her
upon
canvas
and
the
faithful
old
dog
follows
her
and
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
the
faithful
old
dog
is
her
single
attendant
sir
hero
is
revelling
in
the
wars
or
in
armida
bowers
mr
poet
has
spied
a
wrinkle
the
brush
is
for
the
rose
in
its
season
she
turns
to
her
old
dog
then
she
hugs
him
and
he
who
has
subsisted
on
a
bone
and
a
pat
till
there
he
squats
decrepit
he
turns
his
grateful
old
eyes
up
to
her
and
has
not
a
notion
that
she
is
hugging
sad
memories
in
him
hero
poet
painter
in
one
scrubby
one
then
is
she
buried
and
the
village
hears
languid
howls
and
there
is
a
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
concerning
the
extraordinary
fidelity
of
an
old
dog
excited
by
suggestive
recollections
of
nooredeen
and
the
fair
persian
and
the
change
in
the
obscure
monotony
of
his
life
by
his
having
quarters
in
a
crack
hotel
and
living
familiarly
with
people
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
which
forms
a
stout
portion
of
an
honest
romance
ripton
thompson
breakfasted
next
morning
with
his
chief
at
eight
the
meal
had
been
fixed
overnight
for
seven
but
ripton
slept
a
great
deal
more
than
the
nightingale
and
to
chronicle
his
exact
state
even
eight
rather
afflicted
his
new
aristocratic
senses
and
reminded
him
too
keenly
of
law
and
bondage
he
had
preferred
to
breakfast
at
algernon
hour
who
had
left
word
for
eleven
him
however
it
was
richard
object
to
avoid
so
they
fell
to
and
ripton
no
longer
envied
hippias
in
bed
breakfast
done
they
bequeathed
the
consoling
information
for
algernon
that
they
were
off
to
hear
a
popular
preacher
and
departed
how
happy
everybody
looks
said
richard
in
the
quiet
sunday
streets
yes
jolly
said
ripton
when
i
when
this
is
over
i
see
that
they
are
too
as
many
as
i
can
make
happy
said
the
hero
adding
softly
her
blind
was
down
at
a
quarter
to
six
i
think
she
slept
well
you
been
there
this
morning
ripton
exclaimed
and
an
idea
of
what
love
was
dawned
upon
his
dull
brain
will
she
see
me
ricky
yes
she
see
you
she
was
tired
last
night
positively
richard
assured
him
that
the
privilege
would
be
his
here
he
said
coming
under
some
trees
in
the
park
here
where
i
talked
to
you
last
night
what
a
time
it
seems
how
i
hate
the
night
on
the
way
that
richard
might
have
an
exalted
opinion
of
him
ripton
hinted
decorously
at
a
somewhat
intimate
and
mysterious
acquaintance
with
the
sex
headings
of
certain
random
adventures
he
gave
well
said
his
chief
why
not
marry
her
then
was
ripton
shocked
and
cried
oh
and
had
a
taste
of
the
feeling
of
superiority
destined
that
day
to
be
crushed
utterly
he
was
again
deposited
in
berry
charge
for
a
term
that
caused
him
dismal
fears
that
the
fair
persian
still
refused
to
show
her
face
but
richard
called
out
to
him
and
up
ripton
went
unaware
of
the
transformation
he
was
to
undergo
hero
and
beauty
stood
together
to
receive
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
had
his
vivaciously
agreeable
smile
ready
for
them
and
by
the
time
he
entered
the
room
his
cheeks
were
painfully
stiff
and
his
eyes
had
strained
beyond
their
exact
meaning
lucy
with
one
hand
anchored
to
her
lover
welcomed
him
kindly
he
relieved
her
shyness
by
looking
so
extremely
silly
they
sat
down
and
tried
to
commence
a
conversation
but
ripton
was
as
little
master
of
his
tongue
as
he
was
of
his
eyes
after
an
interval
the
fair
persian
having
done
duty
by
showing
herself
was
glad
to
quit
the
room
her
lord
and
possessor
then
turned
inquiringly
to
ripton
you
do
wonder
now
rip
he
said
no
richard
ripton
waited
to
reply
with
sufficient
solemnity
indeed
i
do
he
spoke
differently
he
looked
differently
he
had
the
old
dog
eyes
in
his
head
they
watched
the
door
she
had
passed
through
they
listened
for
her
as
dogs
eyes
do
when
she
came
in
bonneted
for
a
walk
his
agitation
was
when
she
hung
on
her
lover
timidly
and
went
forth
he
followed
without
an
idea
of
envy
or
anything
save
the
secret
raptures
the
sight
of
her
gave
him
which
are
the
old
dog
own
for
beneficent
nature
requites
him
his
sensations
can
not
be
heroic
but
they
have
a
fulness
and
a
wagging
delight
as
good
in
their
way
and
this
capacity
for
humble
unaspiring
worship
has
its
peculiar
guerdon
when
ripton
comes
to
think
of
miss
random
now
what
will
he
think
of
himself
let
no
one
despise
the
old
dog
through
him
doth
beauty
vindicate
her
sex
it
did
not
please
ripton
that
others
should
have
the
bliss
of
beholding
her
and
as
to
his
perceptions
everybody
did
and
observed
her
offensively
and
stared
and
turned
their
heads
back
and
interchanged
comments
on
her
and
became
in
a
minute
madly
in
love
with
her
he
had
to
smother
low
growls
they
strolled
about
the
pleasant
gardens
of
kensington
all
the
morning
under
the
young
chestnut
buds
and
round
the
windless
waters
talking
and
soothing
the
wild
excitement
of
their
hearts
if
lucy
spoke
ripton
pricked
up
his
ears
she
too
made
the
remark
that
everybody
seemed
to
look
happy
and
he
heard
it
with
thrills
of
joy
so
everybody
is
where
you
are
he
would
have
wished
to
say
if
he
dared
but
was
restrained
by
fears
that
his
burning
eloquence
would
commit
him
ripton
knew
the
people
he
met
twice
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
persuade
him
they
were
the
creatures
of
accident
from
the
gardens
in
contempt
of
ripton
frowned
protest
richard
boldly
struck
into
the
park
where
solitary
carriages
were
beginning
to
perform
the
circuit
here
ripton
had
some
justification
for
his
jealous
pangs
the
young
girl
golden
locks
of
hair
her
sweet
now
dreamily
sad
face
her
gentle
graceful
figure
in
the
black
straight
dress
she
wore
a
sort
of
air
she
had
a
mark
of
something
not
of
class
that
was
partly
beauty
partly
maiden
innocence
growing
conscious
partly
remorse
at
her
weakness
and
dim
fear
of
the
future
it
was
sowing
did
attract
the
ripton
had
to
learn
that
eyes
are
bearable
but
an
abomination
they
fixed
a
spell
upon
his
courage
for
somehow
the
youth
had
always
ranked
them
as
emblems
of
our
nobility
and
hearing
two
exquisite
who
had
been
to
front
and
rear
several
times
drawl
in
gibberish
generally
imputed
to
lords
that
his
heroine
was
a
charming
little
creature
just
the
size
but
had
no
style
he
was
abashed
he
did
not
fly
at
them
and
tear
them
he
became
dejected
beauty
dog
is
affected
by
the
in
a
manner
not
unlike
the
common
animal
terror
of
the
human
eye
richard
appeared
to
hear
nothing
or
it
was
homage
that
he
heard
he
repeated
to
lucy
diaper
sandoe
verses
the
cockneys
nod
to
each
other
aside
the
coxcombs
lift
their
glasses
and
projected
hiring
a
horse
for
her
to
ride
every
day
in
the
park
and
shine
among
the
highest
they
had
turned
to
the
west
against
the
sky
glittering
through
the
bare
trees
across
the
water
and
the
rack
the
lover
his
imagination
just
then
occupied
in
clothing
earthly
glories
in
celestial
felt
where
his
senses
were
sharpest
the
hand
of
his
darling
falter
and
instinctively
looked
ahead
his
uncle
algernon
was
leisurely
jolting
towards
them
on
his
one
sound
leg
the
dismembered
guardsman
talked
to
a
friend
whose
arm
supported
him
and
speculated
from
time
to
time
on
the
fair
ladies
driving
by
the
two
white
faces
passed
him
unobserved
unfortunately
ripton
coming
behind
went
plump
upon
the
captain
live
toe
or
so
he
pretended
crying
confound
it
thompson
you
might
have
chosen
the
other
the
horrible
apparition
did
confound
ripton
who
stammered
that
it
was
extraordinary
not
at
all
said
algernon
everybody
makes
up
to
that
fellow
instinct
i
suppose
he
had
not
to
ask
for
his
nephew
richard
turned
to
face
the
matter
sorry
i
could
wait
for
you
this
morning
uncle
he
said
with
the
coolness
of
relationship
i
thought
you
never
walked
so
far
his
voice
was
in
perfect
tone
the
heroic
mask
admirable
algernon
examined
the
downcast
visage
at
his
side
and
contrived
to
allude
to
the
popular
preacher
he
was
instantly
introduced
to
sister
miss
thompson
the
captain
bowed
smiling
melancholy
approval
of
his
nephew
choice
of
a
minister
after
a
few
stray
remarks
and
an
affable
salute
to
miss
thompson
he
hobbled
away
and
then
the
three
sealed
volcanoes
breathed
and
lucy
arm
ceased
to
be
squeezed
quite
so
much
up
to
the
heroic
pitch
this
incident
quickened
their
steps
homeward
to
the
sheltering
wings
of
berry
all
that
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
comprised
a
stammered
excuse
from
ripton
for
his
conduct
and
a
rejoinder
from
richard
that
he
had
gained
a
sister
by
it
at
which
ripton
ventured
to
wish
aloud
miss
desborough
would
only
think
so
and
a
faint
smile
twitched
poor
lucy
lips
to
please
him
she
hardly
had
strength
to
reach
her
cage
she
had
none
to
eat
of
berry
nice
little
dinner
to
be
alone
that
she
might
cry
and
ease
her
heart
of
its
accusing
weight
of
tears
was
all
she
prayed
for
kind
berry
slipping
into
her
bedroom
to
take
off
her
things
found
the
fair
body
in
a
fevered
shudder
and
finished
by
undressing
her
completely
and
putting
her
to
bed
just
an
hour
sleep
or
so
the
mellifluous
woman
explained
the
case
to
the
two
anxious
gentlemen
a
quiet
sleep
and
a
cup
of
warm
tea
goes
for
more
than
twenty
doctors
it
do
when
there
the
flutters
she
pursued
i
know
it
by
myself
and
a
good
cry
beforehand
better
than
the
best
of
medicine
she
nursed
them
into
a
of
eating
and
retired
to
her
softer
charge
and
sweeter
babe
reflecting
lord
lord
the
three
of
make
fifty
i
as
old
as
two
and
a
half
of
to
say
the
least
berry
used
her
apron
and
by
virtue
of
their
tender
years
took
them
all
three
into
her
heart
left
alone
neither
of
the
young
men
could
swallow
a
morsel
did
you
see
the
change
come
over
her
richard
whispered
ripton
fiercely
accused
his
prodigious
stupidity
the
lover
flung
down
his
knife
and
fork
what
could
i
do
if
i
had
said
nothing
we
should
have
been
suspected
i
was
obliged
to
speak
and
she
hates
a
lie
see
it
has
struck
her
down
god
forgive
me
ripton
affected
a
serene
mind
it
was
a
fright
richard
he
said
that
what
berry
means
by
flutters
those
old
women
talk
in
that
way
you
heard
what
she
said
and
these
old
women
know
i
tell
you
what
it
is
it
this
richard
it
because
you
got
a
fool
for
your
friend
she
regrets
it
muttered
the
lover
good
god
i
think
she
fears
me
he
dropped
his
face
in
his
hands
ripton
went
to
the
window
repeating
energetically
for
his
comfort
because
you
got
a
fool
for
your
friend
sombre
grew
the
street
they
had
last
night
aroused
the
sun
was
buried
alive
in
cloud
ripton
saw
himself
no
more
in
the
opposite
window
he
watched
the
deplorable
objects
passing
on
the
pavement
his
aristocratic
visions
had
gone
like
his
breakfast
beauty
had
been
struck
down
by
his
egregious
folly
and
there
he
stood
a
wretch
richard
came
to
him
do
mumble
on
like
that
rip
he
said
nobody
blames
you
ah
you
very
kind
richard
interposed
the
wretch
moved
at
the
face
of
misery
he
beheld
listen
to
me
rip
i
shall
take
her
home
yes
if
happier
away
from
me
do
you
think
me
a
brute
ripton
rather
than
have
her
shed
a
tear
i
i
take
her
home
ripton
suggested
that
it
was
sudden
adding
from
his
larger
experience
people
perhaps
might
talk
the
lover
could
not
understand
what
they
should
talk
about
but
he
said
if
i
give
him
who
came
for
her
yesterday
the
clue
if
no
one
sees
or
hears
of
me
what
can
they
say
o
rip
i
give
her
up
i
wrecked
for
ever
what
of
that
yes
let
them
take
her
the
world
in
arms
should
never
have
torn
her
from
me
but
when
she
cries
yes
all
over
i
find
him
at
once
he
searched
in
corners
for
the
hat
of
resolve
ripton
looked
on
wretcheder
than
ever
the
idea
struck
him
suppose
richard
she
does
want
to
go
it
was
a
moment
when
perhaps
one
who
sided
with
parents
and
guardians
and
the
old
wise
world
might
have
inclined
them
to
pursue
their
righteous
wretched
course
and
have
given
small
cupid
a
smack
and
sent
him
home
to
his
naughty
mother
alas
it
is
the
pilgrim
scrip
interjecting
women
are
the
born
accomplices
of
mischief
in
bustles
berry
to
clear
away
the
refection
and
finds
the
two
knights
helmed
and
sees
though
is
dusk
that
they
wear
doubtful
brows
and
guesses
bad
things
for
her
dear
god
hymen
in
a
twinkling
dear
dear
she
exclaimed
and
neither
of
you
eaten
a
scrap
and
there
my
dear
young
lady
off
into
the
prettiest
sleep
you
ever
see
ha
cried
the
lover
illuminated
soft
as
a
baby
berry
averred
i
went
to
look
at
her
this
very
moment
and
there
not
a
bit
of
trouble
in
her
breath
it
come
and
it
go
like
the
sweetest
regular
instrument
ever
made
the
black
ox
trod
on
her
foot
yet
most
like
it
was
the
air
of
london
but
only
fancy
if
you
had
called
in
a
doctor
why
i
should
have
let
her
take
any
of
his
quackery
now
there
ripton
attentively
observed
his
chief
and
saw
him
doff
his
hat
with
a
curious
caution
and
peer
into
its
recess
from
which
during
berry
speech
he
drew
forth
a
little
glove
dropped
there
by
some
freak
of
chance
keep
me
keep
me
now
you
have
me
sang
the
little
glove
and
amused
the
lover
with
a
thousand
conceits
when
will
she
wake
do
you
think
mrs
berry
he
asked
oh
we
must
go
for
disturbing
her
said
the
guileful
good
creature
bless
ye
let
her
sleep
it
out
and
if
you
young
gentlemen
was
to
take
my
advice
and
go
and
take
a
walk
for
to
get
a
appetite
everybody
should
eat
it
their
sacred
duty
no
matter
what
their
feelings

he
smuggled
a
handful
of
gold
into
her
keeping
and
went
to
dine
with
his
uncles
happy
and
hungry
before
they
reached
the
hotel
they
had
agreed
to
draw
berry
into
their
confidence
telling
her
with
embellishments
all
save
their
names
so
that
they
might
enjoy
the
counsel
and
assistance
of
that
trump
of
a
woman
and
yet
have
nothing
to
fear
from
her
lucy
was
to

of
letitia
ripton
youngest
and
sister
the
heartless
fellow
proposed
it
in
cruel
mockery
of
an
old
weakness
of
hers
letitia
mused
richard
i
like
the
name
both
begin
with
something
soft
womanlike
in
the
material
ripton
remarked
that
they
looked
like
pounds
on
paper
the
lover
roamed
through
his
golden
groves
lucy
feverel
that

better
i
wonder

her
eyes
gazing
up
at
them
oh
your
dear
blue
eyes
that
heavenward
glance
with
kindred
beauty
banished
humbleness
past
weeping
for
mortality
distress
yet
from
your
soul
a
tear
hangs
there
in
trance
and
fills
but
does
not
fall
softly
i
hear
it
call
at
heaven

till
sister
seraphs
press
to

on

old
love

the
skies

the
eyes
of
seraphs

on
your
blue
eyes

written
by
a
man
who

once
a
friend
of
my
father

to
find
him

make
them
friends

trying

nice
said
ripton
modestly
shutting
his
mouth
the
alps
italy
rome
and
then
i
shall
go
to
the
east
the
hero
continued
she
ready
to
go
anywhere
with
me

dear
brave
heart
oh
the
glorious
golden
east
i
dream
of
the
desert

in
the
moonlight
on

mares
and

the
rescue
of
my
darling
and
we
push
the
spears
and
we
scatter
them
and
i
come
to
the
tent
where
she
crouches
and

her
to
my
saddle
and
away

a
wise
man
told
me
that
i
think

shall
do
something
sunshine
and
cloud
cloud
and
sunshine
passed
over
the
lover
now
life
was
a
narrow
ring
now
the
distances
extended
were
winged
flew
illimitably
an
hour
ago
and
food
was
hateful
now
he
manfully
refreshed
his
nature
and
joined
in
algernon
encomiums
on
miss
letitia
thompson
meantime
beauty
slept
watched
by
the
veteran
volunteer
of
the
band
lucy
awoke
from
dreams
which
seemed
reality
to
the
reality
which
was
a
dream
she
awoke
calling
for
some
friend
margaret
and
heard
one
say
my
name
is
bessy
berry
my
love
not
margaret
then
she
asked
piteously
where
she
was
and
where
was
margaret
her
dear
friend
and
berry
whispered
sure
you
got
a
dearer
ah
sighed
lucy
sinking
on
her
pillow
overwhelmed
by
the
strangeness
of
her
state
berry
closed
the
frill
of
her
nightgown
and
adjusted
the
bedclothes
quietly
her
name
was
breathed
yes
my
love
she
said
is
he
here
he
gone
my
dear
gone
oh
where
the
young
girl
started
up
in
disorder
gone
to
be
back
my
love
ah
that
young
gentleman
berry
chanted
not
a
morsel
have
he
eat
not
a
drop
have
he
drunk
o
berry
why
did
you
not
make
him
lucy
wept
for
the
hero
who
was
just
then
feeding
mightily
berry
explained
that
to
make
one
eat
who
thought
the
darling
of
his
heart
like
to
die
was
a
sheer
impossibility
for
the
cleverest
of
women
and
on
this
deep
truth
lucy
reflected
with
her
eyes
wide
at
the
candle
she
wanted
one
to
pour
her
feelings
out
to
she
slid
her
hand
from
under
the
bedclothes
and
took
berry
and
kissed
it
the
good
creature
required
no
further
avowal
of
her
secret
but
forthwith
leaned
her
consummate
bosom
to
the
pillow
and
petitioned
heaven
to
bless
them
both
then
the
little
bride
was
alarmed
and
wondered
how
berry
could
have
guessed
it
why
said
berry
your
love
is
out
of
your
eyes
and
out
of
everything
ye
do
and
the
little
bride
wondered
more
she
thought
she
had
been
so
very
cautious
not
to
betray
it
the
common
woman
in
them
made
cheer
together
after
their
own
april
fashion
following
which
berry
probed
for
the
sweet
particulars
of
this
beautiful
but
the
little
bride
lips
were
locked
she
only
said
her
lover
was
above
her
in
station
and
you
a
catholic
my
dear
yes
mrs
berry
and
him
a
protestant
yes
mrs
berry
dear
dear
and
why
should
ye
be
she
ejaculated
seeing
sadness
return
to
the
bridal
babe
so
as
you
was
born
so
shall
ye
be
but
you
have
to
make
your
arrangements
about
the
children
the
girls
to
worship
with
yet
the
boys
with
him
it
the
same
god
my
dear
you
must
blush
at
it
though
you
do
look
so
pretty
if
my
young
gentleman
could
see
you
now
please
mrs
berry
lucy
murmured
why
he
will
you
know
my
dear
oh
please
mrs
berry
and
you
that
ca
bear
the
thoughts
of
it
well
i
do
wish
there
was
fathers
and
mothers
on
both
sides
and
signed
and
bridesmaids
and
a
breakfast
but
love
is
love
and
ever
will
be
in
spite
of
them
she
made
other
and
deeper
dives
into
the
little
heart
but
though
she
drew
up
pearls
they
were
not
of
the
kind
she
searched
for
the
one
fact
that
hung
as
a
fruit
upon
her
tree
of
love
lucy
had
given
her
she
would
not
in
fealty
to
her
lover
reveal
its
growth
and
history
however
sadly
she
yearned
to
pour
out
all
to
this
dear
old
mother
confessor
her
conduct
drove
berry
from
the
rosy
to
the
autumnal
view
of
matrimony
generally
heralded
by
the
announcement
that
it
is
a
lottery
and
when
you
see
your
ticket
said
berry
you
sha
know
whether
it
a
prize
or
a
blank
and
lord
knows
some
go
on
thinking
it
a
prize
when
it
turns
on
and
tears
i
one
of
the
blanks
my
dear
i
drew
a
blank
in
berry
he
was
a
black
berry
to
me
my
dear
smile
away
he
truly
was
and
i
him
as
proud
as
you
can
conceive
my
dear
berry
pressed
her
hands
flat
on
her
apron
we
had
been
a
three
months
man
and
wife
when
that
man
it
the
honeymoon
which
some
ca
say
that
man
yes
he
kicked
me
his
wedded
wife
he
kicked
ah
she
sighedto
lucy
large
eyes
i
could
have
borne
that
a
blow
do
touch
the
heart
the
poor
creature
tapped
her
sensitive
side
i
went
on
loving
of
him
for
i
a
soft
one
tall
as
a
grenadier
he
is
and
when
out
of
service
grows
his
moustache
i
used
to
call
him
my
like
a
queen
i
flattered
him
like
the
fools
we
women
are
for
take
my
word
for
it
my
dear
there
nothing
here
below
so
vain
as
a
man
that
i
know
but
i
did
deserve
it
i
a
superior
cook
i
did
not
deserve
that
noways
berry
thumped
her
knee
and
accentuated
up
her
climax
i
mended
his
linen
i
saw
to
his
adornments
he
called
his
clothes
the
bad
man
i
was
a
servant
to
him
my
dear
and
there
it
was
nine
months
nine
months
from
the
day
he
swear
to
protect
and
cherish
and
that
nine
calendar
months
and
my
gentleman
is
off
with
another
woman
bone
of
his
bone
pish
exclaimed
berry
reckoning
her
wrongs
over
vividly
here
my
ring
a
pretty
ornament
what
do
it
mean
i
for
tearin
it
off
my
finger
a
dozen
times
in
the
day
it
a
symbol
i
call
it
a
tomfoolery
for
the
to
wear
it
that
a
widow
and
not
a
widow
and
have
got
a
name
for
what
she
is
in
any
dixonary
looked
my
dear
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
johnson
have
got
a
name
for
me
at
this
impressive
woe
berry
voice
quavered
into
sobs
lucy
spoke
gentle
words
to
the
poor
outcast
from
johnson
the
sorrows
of
autumn
have
no
warning
for
april
the
little
bride
for
all
her
tender
pity
felt
happier
when
she
had
heard
her
landlady
moving
tale
of
the
wickedness
of
man
which
cast
in
bright
relief
the
glory
of
that
one
hero
who
was
hers
then
from
a
short
flight
of
inconceivable
bliss
she
fell
shot
by
one
of
her
hundred
fears
o
berry
i
so
young
think
of
me
only
just
seventeen
berry
immediately
dried
her
eyes
to
radiance
young
my
dear
nonsense
there
no
so
much
harm
in
being
young
here
and
there
i
knew
an
irish
lady
was
married
at
fourteen
her
daughter
married
close
over
fourteen
she
was
a
grandmother
by
thirty
when
any
strange
man
began
she
used
to
ask
him
what
pattern
caps
grandmothers
wore
stare
bless
you
the
grandmother
could
have
married
over
and
over
again
it
was
her
daughter
fault
not
hers
you
know
she
was
three
years
younger
mused
lucy
she
married
beneath
her
my
dear
ran
off
with
her
father
son
berry
she
say
i
had
been
foolish
i
should
be
my
lady
now
not
granny
her
father
never
forgave
her
left
all
his
estates
out
of
the
family
did
her
husband
always
love
her
lucy
preferred
to
know
in
his
way
my
dear
he
did
said
berry
coming
upon
her
matrimonial
wisdom
he
could
help
himself
if
he
left
off
he
began
again
she
was
so
clever
and
did
make
him
so
comfortable
cook
there
was
such
another
cook
out
of
a
alderman
kitchen
no
indeed
and
she
a
born
lady
that
tells
ye
it
the
duty
of
all
women
she
had
her
saying
the
parlour
fire
gets
low
put
coals
on
the
ketchen
fire
and
a
good
saying
it
is
to
treasure
such
is
man
no
use
in
havin
their
hearts
if
ye
do
have
their
stomachs
perceiving
that
she
grew
abstruse
berry
added
briskly
you
know
nothing
about
that
yet
my
dear
only
mind
me
and
mark
me
do
neglect
your
cookery
kissing
do
last
cookery
do
here
with
an
aphorism
worthy
a
place
in
the
pilgrim
scrip
she
broke
off
to
go
posseting
for
her
dear
invalid
lucy
was
quite
well
very
eager
to
be
allowed
to
rise
and
be
ready
when
the
knock
should
come
berry
in
her
loving
considerateness
for
the
little
bride
positively
commanded
her
to
lie
down
and
be
quiet
and
submit
to
be
nursed
and
cherished
for
berry
well
knew
that
ten
minutes
alone
with
the
hero
could
only
be
had
while
the
little
bride
was
in
that
unattainable
position
thanks
to
her
strategy
as
she
thought
her
object
was
gained
the
night
did
not
pass
before
she
learnt
from
the
hero
own
mouth
that
richards
the
father
of
the
hero
and
a
stern
lawyer
was
adverse
to
his
union
with
this
young
lady
he
loved
because
of
a
ward
of
his
heiress
to
an
immense
property
whom
he
desired
his
son
to
espouse
and
because
his
darling
letitia
was
a
catholic
letitia
the
sole
daughter
of
a
brave
naval
officer
deceased
and
in
the
hands
of
a
savage
uncle
who
wanted
to
sacrifice
this
beauty
to
a
brute
of
a
son
berry
listened
credulously
to
the
emphatic
narrative
and
spoke
to
the
effect
that
the
wickedness
of
old
people
formed
the
excuse
for
the
wildness
of
young
ones
the
ceremonious
administration
of
oaths
of
secrecy
and
devotion
over
she
was
enrolled
in
the
hero
band
which
now
numbered
three
and
entered
upon
the
duties
with
feminine
energy
for
there
are
no
conspirators
like
women
ripton
lieutenancy
became
a
sinecure
his
rank
merely
titular
he
had
never
been
married
he
knew
nothing
about
licences
except
that
they
must
be
obtained
and
were
not
difficult
he
had
not
an
idea
that
so
many
days
warning
must
be
given
to
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
where
one
of
the
parties
was
resident
how
should
he
all
his
forethought
was
comprised
in
the
ring
and
whenever
the
discussion
of
arrangements
for
the
great
event
grew
particularly
hot
and
important
he
would
say
with
a
shrewd
nod
we
must
forget
the
ring
you
know
mrs
berry
and
the
new
member
was
only
prevented
by
natural
complacence
from
shouting
oh
drat
ye
and
your
ring
too
berry
had
acted
conspicuously
in
fifteen
marriages
by
banns
and
by
licence
and
to
have
such
an
obvious
requisite
dinned
in
her
ears
was
exasperating
they
could
not
have
contracted
alliance
with
an
auxiliary
more
invaluable
an
authority
so
profound
and
they
acknowledged
it
to
themselves
the
hero
marched
like
an
automaton
at
her
bidding
lieutenant
thompson
was
rejoiced
to
perform
services
as
in
the
enterprise
it
in
hopes
you
be
happier
than
me
i
do
it
said
the
devout
and
charitable
berry
marriages
is
made
in
heaven
they
say
and
if
the
case
i
say
they
do
take
much
account
of
us
below
her
own
woeful
experiences
had
been
given
to
the
hero
in
exchange
for
his
story
of
cruel
parents
richard
vowed
to
her
that
he
would
henceforth
hold
it
a
duty
to
hunt
out
the
wanderer
from
wedded
bonds
and
bring
him
back
bound
and
suppliant
oh
he
come
said
berry
pursing
prophetic
wrinkles
come
of
his
own
accord
never
anywhere
will
he
meet
such
a
cook
as
bessy
berry
and
he
know
her
value
in
his
heart
of
hearts
and
i
do
believe
when
he
do
come
i
shall
be
opening
these
arms
to
him
again
and
not
slapping
his
impidence
in
the
face
i
that
soft
i
always
was
in
matrimony
mr
richards
as
when
nations
are
secretly
preparing
for
war
the
docks
and
arsenals
hammer
night
and
day
and
busy
contractors
measure
time
by
inches
and
the
air
hums
around
for
leagues
as
it
were
myriads
of
bees
so
the
house
and
neighbourhood
of
the
matrimonial
soft
one
resounded
in
the
heroic
style
and
knew
little
of
the
changes
of
light
decreed
by
creation
berry
was
the
general
of
the
hour
down
to
doctors
commons
she
expedited
the
hero
instructing
him
how
boldly
to
face
the
law
and
fib
for
that
the
law
never
could
mist
a
fib
and
a
bold
face
down
the
hero
went
and
proclaimed
his
presence
and
lo
the
law
danced
to
him
its
sedatest
lovely
think
ye
the
lawless
susceptible
to
him
than
flesh
and
blood
with
a
beautiful
confidence
it
put
the
few
familiar
questions
to
him
and
nodded
to
his
replies
then
stamped
the
bond
and
took
the
fee
it
must
be
an
old
vagabond
at
heart
that
can
permit
the
irrevocable
to
go
so
cheap
even
to
a
hero
for
only
mark
him
when
he
is
petitioned
by
heroes
and
heroines
to
undo
what
he
does
so
easily
that
small
archway
of

it
as

in

as
buying

likewise
the
ambassador
of
the
hero
went
to
claim
the
promise
of
the
church
to
be
in
attendance
on
a
certain
spot
on
a
certain
day
and
there
hear
oath
of
eternal
fealty
and
gird
him
about
with
all
its
forces
which
the
church
receiving
a
wink
from

law
obsequiously
engaged
to
do
for
less
than
the
price
of
a
meantime
while
craftsmen
and
skilled
women
directed
by
berry
were
toiling
to
deck
the
day
at
hand
raynham
and
belthorpe
slept
the
former
soundly
and
one
day
was
as
another
to
them
regularly
every
morning
a
letter
arrived
from
richard
to
his
father
containing
observations
on
the
phenomena
of
london
remarks
mainly
cynical
on
the
speeches
and
acts
of
parliament
and
reasons
for
not
having
yet
been
able
to
call
on
the
grandisons
they
were
certainly
rather
monotonous
and
spiritless
the
baronet
did
not
complain
that
cold
dutiful
tone
assured
him
there
was
no
internal
trouble
or
distraction
the
letters
of
a
healthful
physique
he
said
to
lady
blandish
with
sure
insight
complacently
he
sat
and
smiled
little
witting
that
his
son
ordeal
was
imminent
and
that
his
son
ordeal
was
to
be
his
own
hippias
wrote
that
his
nephew
was
killing
him
by
making
appointments
which
he
never
kept
and
altogether
neglecting
him
in
the
most
shameless
way
so
that
his
ganglionic
centre
was
in
a
ten
times
worse
state
than
when
he
left
raynham
he
wrote
very
bitterly
but
it
was
hard
to
feel
compassion
for
his
offended
stomach
on
the
other
hand
young
tom
blaize
was
not
forthcoming
and
had
despatched
no
tidings
whatever
farmer
blaize
smoked
his
pipe
evening
after
evening
vastly
disturbed
london
was
a
large
place
young
tom
might
be
lost
in
it
he
thought
and
young
tom
had
his
weaknesses
a
wolf
at
belthorpe
he
was
likely
to
be
a
sheep
in
london
as
yokels
have
proved
but
what
had
become
of
lucy
this
consideration
almost
sent
farmer
blaize
off
to
london
direct
and
he
would
have
gone
had
not
his
pipe
enlightened
him
a
young
fellow
might
play
truant
and
get
into
a
scrape
but
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
were
sure
to
be
heard
of
unless
they
were
acting
in
complicity
why
of
course
young
tom
had
behaved
like
a
man
the
rascal
and
married
her
outright
there
while
he
had
the
chance
it
was
a
long
guess
still
it
was
the
only
reasonable
way
of
accounting
for
his
extraordinary
silence
and
therefore
the
farmer
held
to
it
that
he
had
done
the
deed
he
argued
as
modern
men
do
who
think
the
hero
the
upsetter
of
ordinary
calculations
is
gone
from
us
so
after
despatching
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
town
to
be
on
the
outlook
for
son
tom
he
continued
awhile
to
smoke
his
pipe
rather
elated
than
not
and
mused
on
the
shrewd
manner
he
should
adopt
when
master
honeymoon
did
appear
toward
the
middle
of
the
second
week
of
richard
absence
tom
bakewell
came
to
raynham
for
cassandra
and
privately
handed
a
letter
to
the
eighteenth
century
containing
a
request
for
money
and
a
round
sum
the
eighteenth
century
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
gave
tom
a
letter
in
return
enclosing
a
cheque
on
her
bankers
amply
providing
to
keep
the
heroic
engine
in
motion
at
a
moderate
pace
tom
went
back
and
raynham
and
lobourne
slept
and
dreamed
not
of
the
morrow
the
system
wedded
to
time
slept
and
knew
not
how
he
had
been
outraged
anticipated
by
seven
pregnant
seasons
for
time
had
heard
the
hero
swear
to
that
legalizing
instrument
and
had
also
registered
an
oath
ah
me
venerable
hebrew
time
he
is
unforgiving
half
the
confusion
and
fever
of
the
world
comes
of
this
vendetta
he
declares
against
the
hapless
innocents
who
have
once
done
him
a
wrong
they
can
not
escape
him
they
will
never
outlive
it
the
father
of
jokes
he
is
himself
no
joke
which
it
seems
the
business
of
men
to
discover
the
days
roll
round
he
is
their
servant
now
berry
has
a
new
satin
gown
a
beautiful
bonnet
a
gold
brooch
and
sweet
gloves
presented
to
her
by
the
hero
wherein
to
stand
by
his
bride
at
the
altar
and
instead
of
being
an
old
wary
hen
she
is
as
much
a
chicken
as
any
of
the
party
such
has
been
the
magic
of
these
articles
fathers
she
sees
accepting
the
facts
produced
for
them
by
their
children
a
world
content
to
be
carved
out
as
it
pleases
the
hero
at
last
time
brings
the
bridal
eve
and
is
blest
as
a
benefactor
the
final
arrangements
are
made
the
bridegroom
does
depart
and
berry
lights
the
little
bride
to
her
bed
lucy
stops
on
the
landing
where
there
is
an
old
clock
eccentrically
correct
that
night
is
the
palpitating
pause
before
the
gates
of
her
transfiguration
berry
sees
her
put
her
rosy
finger
on
the
one
about
to
strike
and
touch
all
the
hours
successively
till
she
comes
to

in

ears
on
the
morrow
moving
her
lips
the
while
and
looking
round
archly
solemn
when
she
has
done

that
sight
so
catches
at
berry
heart

not

endangers
her
candle
by

richard
feverel
was
now
crossing
the
river
of
his
ordeal
already
the
mists
were
stealing
over
the
land
he
had
left
his
life
was
cut
in
two
and
he
breathed
but
the
air
that
met
his
nostrils
his
father
his
father
love
his
boyhood
and
ambition
were
shadowy
his
poetic
dreams
had
taken
a
living
attainable
shape
he
had
a
distincter
impression
of
the
autumnal
berry
and
her
household
than
of
anything
at
raynham
and
yet
the
young
man
loved
his
father
loved
his
home
and
i
daresay
caesar
loved
rome
but
whether
he
did
or
no
caesar
when
he
killed
the
republic
was
quite
bald
and
the
hero
we
are
dealing
with
is
scarce
beginning
to
feel
his
despotic
moustache
did
he
know
what
he
was
made
of
doubtless
nothing
at
all
but
honest
passion
has
an
instinct
that
can
be
safer
than
conscious
wisdom
he
was
an
arrow
drawn
to
the
head
flying
from
the
bow
his
audacious
mendacities
and
subterfuges
did
not
strike
him
as
in
any
way
criminal
for
he
was
perfectly
sure
that
the
winning
and
securing
of
lucy
would
in
the
end
be
boisterously
approved
of
and
in
that
case
were
not
the
means
justified
not
that
he
took
trouble
to
argue
thus
as
older
heroes
and
villains
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
to
deduce
a
clear
conscience
conscience
and
lucy
went
together
it
was
a
soft
fair
day
the
rubicon
sparkled
in
the
morning
sun
one
of
those
days
when
london
embraces
the
prospect
of
summer
and
troops
forth
all
its
babies
the
pavement
the
squares
the
parks
were
early
alive
with
the
cries
of
young
britain
violet
and
primrose
girls
and
organ
boys
with
military
monkeys
and
systematic
bands
very
determined
in
tone
if
not
in
tune
filled
the
atmosphere
and
crowned
the
blazing
procession
of
omnibuses
freighted
with
business
men
cityward
where
a
column
of
reddish
brown
smoke
blown
aloft
by
the
marked
the
scene
of
conflict
to
which
these
persistent
warriors
repaired
richard
had
seen
much
of
early
london
that
morning
his
plans
were
laid
he
had
taken
care
to
ensure
his
personal
liberty
against
accidents
by
leaving
his
hotel
and
his
injured
uncle
hippias
at
sunrise
or
his
father
was
to
arrive
farmer
blaize
tom
bakewell
reported
to
him
was
raging
in
town
another
day
and
she
might
be
torn
from
him
but
this
miracle
of
creation
would
be
his
and
then
from
those
glittering
banks
yonder
let
them
summon
him
to
surrender
her
who
dared
the
position
of
things
looked
so
propitious
that
he
naturally
thought
the
powers
waiting
on
love
conspired
in
his
behalf
and
she
too
since
she
must
cross
this
river
she
had
sworn
to
him
to
be
brave
and
do
him
honour
and
wear
the
true
gladness
of
her
heart
in
her
face
without
a
suspicion
of
folly
in
his
acts
or
fear
of
results
richard
strolled
into
kensington
gardens
breakfasting
on
the
foreshadow
of
his
great
joy
now
with
a
vision
of
his
bride
now
of
the
new
life
opening
to
him
mountain
masses
of
clouds
rounded
in
sunlight
swung
up
the
blue
the
flowering
chestnut
pavilions
overhead
rustled
and
hummed
a
sound
in
his
ears
as
of
a
banner
unfolding
in
the
joyful
distance
lulled
him
he
was
to
meet
his
bride
at
the
church
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
his
watch
said
a
quarter
to
ten
he
strolled
on
beneath
the
trees
toward
the
well
dedicated
to
a
saint
obscure
some
people
were
drinking
at
the
well
a
florid
lady
stood
by
a
younger
one
who
had
a
little
silver
mug
to
her
mouth
and
evinced
undisguised
dislike
to
the
liquor
of
the
salutary
saint
drink
child
said
the
maturer
lady
that
is
only
your
second
mug
i
insist
upon
your
drinking
three
full
ones
every
morning
we
in
town
your
constitution
positively
requires
iron
but
mama
the
other
expostulated
it
so
nasty
i
shall
be
sick
drink
was
the
harsh
injunction
nothing
to
the
german
waters
my
dear
here
let
me
taste
she
took
the
mug
and
gave
it
a
flying
kiss
i
declare
i
think
it
almost
nice
not
at
all
objectionable
pray
taste
it
she
said
to
a
gentleman
standing
below
them
to
act
as
an
unmistakable
voice
replied
certainly
if
it
good
fellowship
though
i
confess
i
do
think
mutual
sickness
a
very
engaging
ceremony
can
one
never
escape
from
one
relatives
richard
ejaculated
inwardly
without
a
doubt
those
people
were
doria
clare
and
adrian
he
had
them
under
his
eyes
clare
peeping
up
from
her
constitutional
dose
to
make
sure
no
man
was
near
to
see
the
possible
consequence
of
it
was
the
first
to
perceive
him
her
hand
dropped
now
pray
drink
and
do
not
fuss
said
doria
mama
clare
gasped
richard
came
forward
and
capitulated
honourably
since
retreat
was
out
of
the
question
doria
swam
to
meet
him
my
own
boy
my
dear
richard
profuse
of
exclamations
clare
shyly
greeted
him
adrian
kept
in
the
background
why
we
were
coming
for
you
richard
said
doria
smiling
effusion
and
rattled
on
we
want
another
cavalier
this
is
delightful
my
dear
nephew
you
have
grown
from
a
boy
to
a
man
and
there
down
on
his
lip
and
what
brings
you
here
at
such
an
hour
in
the
morning
poetry
i
suppose
here
take
my
arm
clare
finish
that
mug
and
thank
your
cousin
for
sparing
you
the
third
i
always
bring
her
when
we
are
by
a
chalybeate
to
take
the
waters
before
breakfast
we
have
to
get
up
at
unearthly
hours
think
my
dear
boy
mothers
are
sacrifices
and
so
you
been
alone
a
fortnight
with
your
agreeable
uncle
a
charming
time
of
it
you
must
have
had
poor
hippias
what
may
be
his
last
nostrum
nephew
adrian
stretched
his
head
round
to
the
couple
doses
of
nephew
taken
morning
and
night
fourteen
days
and
he
guarantees
that
it
shall
destroy
an
iron
constitution
in
a
month
richard
mechanically
shook
adrian
hand
as
he
spoke
quite
well
ricky
yes
well
enough
richard
answered
well
resumed
his
vigorous
aunt
walking
on
with
him
while
clare
and
adrian
followed
i
really
never
saw
you
looking
so
handsome
something
about
your
face
look
at
me
you
need
blush
you
grown
to
an
apollo
that
blue
frock
coat
becomes
you
admirably
and
those
gloves
and
that
easy
your
style
is
irreproachable
quite
a
style
of
your
own
and
nothing
eccentric
you
have
the
instinct
of
dress
dress
shows
blood
my
dear
boy
as
much
as
anything
else
boy
you
see
i
ca
forget
old
habits
you
were
a
boy
when
i
left
and
now
do
you
see
any
change
in
him
clare
she
turned
half
round
to
her
daughter
richard
is
looking
very
well
mama
said
clare
glancing
at
him
under
her
eyelids
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
of
you
my
take
my
arm
richard
are
you
afraid
of
your
aunt
i
want
to
get
used
to
you
wo
it
be
pleasant
our
being
all
in
town
together
in
the
season
how
fresh
the
opera
will
be
to
you
austin
i
hear
takes
stalls
you
can
come
to
the
forey
box
when
you
like
we
are
staying
with
the
foreys
close
by
here
i
think
it
a
little
too
far
out
you
know
but
they
like
the
neighbourhood
this
is
what
i
have
always
said
give
him
more
liberty
austin
has
seen
it
at
last
how
do
you
think
clare
looking
the
question
had
to
be
repeated
richard
surveyed
his
cousin
hastily
and
praised
her
looks
pale
doria
sighed
rather
pale
aunt
grown
very
much
do
you
think
richard
very
tall
girl
indeed
aunt
if
she
had
but
a
little
more
colour
my
dear
richard
i
sure
i
give
her
all
the
iron
she
can
swallow
but
that
pallor
still
continues
i
think
she
does
not
prosper
away
from
her
old
companion
she
was
accustomed
to
look
up
to
you
richard
did
you
get
ralph
letter
aunt
richard
interrupted
her
absurd
doria
pressed
his
arm
the
nonsense
of
a
boy
why
did
you
undertake
to
forward
such
stuff
i
certain
he
loves
her
said
richard
in
a
serious
way
the
maternal
eyes
narrowed
on
him
life
my
dear
richard
is
a
game
of
she
observed
dropping
her
fluency
and
was
rather
angered
to
hear
him
laugh
he
excused
himself
by
saying
that
she
spoke
so
like
his
father
you
breakfast
with
us
she
freshened
off
again
the
foreys
wish
to
see
you
the
girls
are
dying
to
know
you
do
you
know
you
have
a
reputation
on
account
of
that
she
crushed
an
intruding
adjective
system
you
were
brought
up
on
you
must
mind
it
for
my
part
i
think
you
look
a
credit
to
it
do
be
bashful
with
young
women
mind
as
much
as
you
please
with
the
old
ones
you
know
how
to
behave
among
men
there
you
have
your
guide
i
sure
i
shall
be
proud
of
you
am
i
not
doria
addressed
his
eyes
coaxingly
a
benevolent
idea
struck
richard
that
he
might
employ
the
minutes
to
spare
in
pleading
the
case
of
poor
ralph
and
as
he
was
drawn
along
he
pulled
out
his
watch
to
note
the
precise
number
of
minutes
he
could
dedicate
to
this
charitable
office
pardon
me
said
doria
you
want
manners
my
dear
boy
i
think
it
never
happened
to
me
before
that
a
man
consulted
his
watch
in
my
presence
richard
mildly
replied
that
he
had
an
engagement
at
a
particular
hour
up
to
which
he
was
her
servant
fiddlededee
the
vivacious
lady
sang
now
i
got
you
i
mean
to
keep
you
oh
i
heard
all
about
you
this
ridiculous
indifference
that
your
father
makes
so
much
of
why
of
course
you
wanted
to
see
the
world
a
strong
healthy
young
man
shut
up
all
his
life
in
a
lonely
house
no
friends
no
society
no
amusements
but
those
of
rustics
of
course
you
were
indifferent
your
intelligence
and
superior
mind
alone
saved
you
from
becoming
a
dissipated
country
where
are
the
others
clare
and
adrian
came
up
at
a
quick
pace
my
damozel
dropped
something
adrian
explained
her
mother
asked
what
it
was
nothing
mama
said
clare
demurely
and
they
proceeded
as
before
overborne
by
his
aunt
fluency
of
tongue
and
occupied
in
acute
calculation
of
the
flying
minutes
richard
let
many
pass
before
he
edged
in
a
word
for
ralph
when
he
did
doria
stopped
him
immediately
i
must
tell
you
child
that
i
refuse
to
listen
to
such
rank
idiotcy
it
nothing
of
the
kind
aunt
the
fancy
of
a
boy
he
not
a
boy
he
older
than
i
am
you
silly
child
the
moment
you
fall
in
love
you
all
think
yourselves
men
on
my
honour
aunt
i
believe
he
loves
her
thoroughly
did
he
tell
you
so
child
men
do
speak
openly
of
those
things
said
richard
boys
do
said
doria
but
listen
to
me
in
earnest
aunt
i
want
you
to
be
kind
to
ralph
do
drive
him
to
you
maybe
sorry
for
it
let
him
do
let
him
write
to
her
and
see
her
i
believe
women
are
as
cruel
as
men
in
these
things
i
never
encourage
absurdity
richard
what
objection
have
you
to
ralph
aunt
oh
they
both
good
families
it
not
that
absurdity
richard
it
will
be
to
his
credit
to
remember
that
his
first
fancy
was
a
dairymaid
doria
pitched
her
accent
tellingly
it
did
not
touch
her
nephew
do
you
want
clare
ever
to
marry
he
put
the
last
point
of
reason
to
her
doria
laughed
i
hope
so
child
we
must
find
some
comfortable
old
gentleman
for
her
what
infamy
mutters
richard
and
i
engage
ralph
shall
be
ready
to
dance
at
her
wedding
or
eat
a
hearty
breakfast
we
do
dance
at
weddings
now
and
very
properly
it
a
horrid
sad
business
not
to
be
treated
with
is
that
his
regiment
she
said
as
they
passed
out
of
the
gardens
tush
tush
child
master
ralph
will
recover
as
hem
others
have
done
a
little
headache
you
call
it
heartache
and
up
you
rise
again
looking
better
than
ever
no
doubt
to
have
a
grain
of
sense
forced
into
your
brains
you
poor
dear
children
must
be
girls
suffer
as
much
as
boys
i
assure
you
more
for
their
heads
are
weaker
and
their
appetites
less
constant
do
i
talk
like
your
father
now
whatever
makes
the
boy
fidget
at
his
watch
so
richard
stopped
short
time
spoke
urgently
i
must
go
he
said
his
face
did
not
seem
good
for
trifling
doria
would
trifle
in
spite
listen
clare
richard
is
going
he
says
he
has
an
engagement
what
possible
engagement
can
a
young
man
have
at
eleven
in
the
morning
unless
it
to
be
married
doria
laughed
at
the
ingenuity
of
her
suggestion
is
the
church
handy
ricky
said
adrian
you
can
still
give
us
if
it
is
the
celibate
hours
strike
at
twelve
and
he
also
laughed
in
his
fashion
wo
you
stay
with
us
richard
clare
asked
she
blushed
timidly
and
her
voice
shook
something
indefinite
a
thrill
in
the
tones
made
the
burning
bridegroom
speak
gently
to
her
indeed
i
would
clare
i
should
like
to
please
you
but
i
have
a
most
imperative
appointment
that
is
i
promised
i
must
go
i
shall
see
you
again
doria
took
forcible
possession
of
him
now
do
come
and
waste
words
i
insist
upon
your
having
some
breakfast
first
and
then
if
you
really
must
go
you
shall
look
there
the
house
at
least
you
will
accompany
your
aunt
to
the
door
richard
conceded
this
she
little
imagined
what
she
required
of
him
two
of
his
golden
minutes
melted
into
nothingness
they
were
growing
to
be
jewels
of
price
one
by
one
more
and
more
precious
as
they
ran
and
now
so
rich
as
his
blood
not
to
kindest
relations
dearest
friends
could
he
give
another
the
die
is
cast
ferryman
push
off
he
cried
nodding
bluffly
at
the
three
as
one
and
fled
they
watched
his
abrupt
muscular
stride
through
the
grounds
of
the
house
he
looked
like
resolution
on
the
march
doria
as
usual
with
her
out
of
her
brother
hearing
began
rating
the
system
see
what
becomes
of
that
nonsensical
education
the
boy
really
does
not
know
how
to
behave
like
a
common
mortal
he
has
some
paltry
appointment
or
is
mad
after
some
ridiculous
idea
of
his
own
and
everything
must
be
sacrificed
to
it
that
what
austin
calls
concentration
of
the
faculties
i
think
it
more
likely
to
lead
to
downright
insanity
than
to
greatness
of
any
kind
and
so
i
shall
tell
austin
it
time
he
should
be
spoken
to
seriously
about
him
he
an
engine
my
dear
aunt
said
adrian
he
is
a
boy
or
a
man
but
an
engine
and
he
appears
to
have
been
at
high
pressure
since
he
came
to
town
out
all
day
and
half
the
night
he
mad
doria
interjected
not
at
all
extremely
shrewd
is
master
ricky
and
carries
as
open
an
eye
ahead
of
him
as
the
ships
before
troy
he
more
than
a
match
for
any
of
us
he
is
for
me
i
confess
then
said
doria
he
does
astonish
me
adrian
begged
her
to
retain
her
astonishment
till
the
right
season
which
would
not
be
long
arriving
their
common
wisdom
counselled
them
not
to
tell
the
foreys
of
their
hopeful
relative
ungracious
behaviour
clare
had
left
them
when
doria
went
to
her
room
her
daughter
was
there
gazing
down
at
something
in
her
hand
which
she
guiltily
closed
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
why
she
had
not
gone
to
take
off
her
things
clare
said
she
was
not
hungry
doria
lamented
the
obstinacy
of
a
constitution
that
no
quantity
of
iron
could
affect
and
eclipsed
the
saying
take
them
off
here
child
and
learn
to
assist
yourself
she
disentangled
her
bonnet
from
the
array
of
her
spreading
hair
talking
of
richard
and
his
handsome
appearance
and
extraordinary
conduct
clare
kept
opening
and
shutting
her
hand
in
an
attitude
she
did
not
stir
to
undress
a
joyless
dimple
hung
in
one
pale
cheek
and
she
drew
long
even
breaths
doria
assured
by
the
glass
that
she
was
ready
to
show
came
to
her
daughter
now
really
she
said
you
are
too
helpless
my
dear
you
can
not
do
a
thing
without
a
dozen
women
at
your
elbow
what
will
become
of
you
you
will
have
to
marry
a
what
the
matter
with
you
child
clare
undid
her
fingers
as
if
to
some
attraction
of
her
eyes
and
displayed
a
small
gold
hoop
on
the
palm
of
a
green
glove
a
exclaimed
doria
inspecting
the
curiosity
most
daintily
there
on
clare
pale
green
glove
lay
a
rapid
questions
as
to
where
when
how
it
was
found
beset
clare
who
replied
in
the
gardens
mama
this
morning
when
i
was
walking
behind
richard
are
you
sure
he
did
not
give
it
you
clare
oh
no
mama
he
did
not
give
it
me
of
course
not
only
he
does
such
absurd
things
ithought
perhaps
these
boys
are
so
exceedingly
ridiculous
doria
had
an
idea
that
it
might
have
been
concerted
between
the
two
young
gentlemen
richard
and
ralph
that
the
former
should
present
this
token
of
hymeneal
devotion
from
the
latter
to
the
young
lady
of
his
love
but
a
moment
reflection
exonerated
boys
even
from
such
preposterous
behaviour
now
i
wonder
she
speculated
on
clare
cold
face
i
do
wonder
whether
it
lucky
to
find
a
what
very
quick
eyes
you
have
my
darling
doria
kissed
her
she
thought
it
must
be
lucky
and
the
circumstance
made
her
feel
tender
to
her
child
her
child
did
not
move
to
the
kiss
let
see
whether
it
fits
said
doria
almost
infantine
with
surprise
and
pleasure
clare
suffered
her
glove
to
be
drawn
off
the
ring
slid
down
her
long
thin
finger
and
settled
comfortably
it
does
doria
whispered
to
find
a
wedding
ring
is
open
to
any
woman
but
to
find
a
that
fits
may
well
cause
a
superstitious
emotion
moreover
that
it
should
be
found
while
walking
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
identical
youth
whom
a
mother
has
destined
for
her
daughter
gives
significance
to
the
gentle
perturbation
of
ideas
consequent
on
such
a
hint
from
fortune
it
really
fits
she
pursued
now
i
never
pay
any
attention
to
the
nonsense
of
omens
and
that
kind
of
thing
had
the
ring
been
a
horseshoe
doria
would
have
pinked
it
up
and
dragged
it
obediently
home
but
this
i
must
say
is
odd
to
find
a
ring
that
fits
singular
it
never
happened
to
me
sixpence
is
the
most
i
ever
discovered
and
i
have
it
now
mind
you
keep
it
clare
this
ring
and
she
laughed
offer
it
to
richard
when
he
comes
say
you
think
he
must
have
dropped
it
the
dimple
in
clare
cheek
quivered
mother
and
daughter
had
never
spoken
explicitly
of
richard
doria
by
exquisite
management
had
contrived
to
be
sure
that
on
one
side
there
would
be
no
obstacle
to
her
project
of
general
happiness
without
as
she
thought
compromising
her
daughter
feelings
unnecessarily
it
could
do
no
harm
to
an
obedient
young
girl
to
hear
that
there
was
no
youth
in
the
world
like
a
certain
youth
he
the
prince
of
his
generation
she
might
softly
consent
when
requested
to
be
his
princess
and
if
never
requested
for
doria
envisaged
failure
she
might
easily
transfer
her
softness
to
squires
of
lower
degree
clare
had
always
been
blindly
obedient
to
her
mother
adrian
called
them
doria
battledoria
and
the
fair
shuttlecockiana
and
her
mother
accepted
in
this
blind
obedience
the
text
of
her
entire
character
it
is
difficult
for
those
who
think
very
earnestly
for
their
children
to
know
when
their
children
are
thinking
on
their
own
account
the
exercise
of
their
volition
we
construe
as
revolt
our
love
does
not
like
to
be
invalided
and
deposed
from
its
command
and
here
i
think
yonder
old
thrush
on
the
lawn
who
has
just
kicked
the
last
of
her
lank
offspring
out
of
the
nest
to
go
shift
for
itself
much
the
kinder
of
the
two
though
sentimental
people
do
shrug
their
shoulders
at
these
unsentimental
acts
of
the
creatures
who
never
wander
from
nature
now
excess
of
obedience
is
to
one
who
manages
most
exquisitely
as
bad
as
insurrection
happily
doria
saw
nothing
in
her
daughter
manner
save
a
want
of
iron
her
pallor
her
lassitude
the
tremulous
nerves
in
her
face
exhibited
an
imperious
requirement
of
the
mineral
the
reason
why
men
and
women
are
mysterious
to
us
and
prove
disappointing
we
learn
from
the
pilgrim
scrip
is
that
we
will
read
them
from
our
own
book
just
as
we
are
perplexed
by
reading
ourselves
from
theirs
doria
read
her
daughter
from
her
own
book
and
she
was
gay
she
laughed
with
adrian
at
the
and
joined
in
his
jocose
assertion
that
clare
was
positively
and
by
all
hymeneal
auspices
betrothed
to
the
owner
of
that
ring
be
he
who
he
may
and
must
whenever
he
should
choose
to
come
and
claim
her
give
her
hand
to
him
for
everybody
agreed
the
owner
must
be
masculine
as
no
woman
would
drop
a
and
follow
him
whither
he
listed
all
the
world
over
amiable
giggling
forey
girls
called
clare
the
betrothed
dark
man
or
fair
was
mooted
adrian
threw
off
the
first
strophe
of
clare
fortune
in
burlesque
rhymes
with
an
insinuating
gipsy
twang
her
aunt
forey
warned
her
to
have
her
dresses
in
readiness
her
grandpapa
forey
pretended
to
grumble
at
bridal
presents
being
expected
from
grandpapas
this
one
smelt
another
spoke
solemnly
of
an
old
shoe
the
finding
of
a

celebrated
through
all
the
palpitating
accessories
and
rosy
ceremonies
involved
by
that
famous
instrument
in
the
midst
of
the
general
hilarity
clare
showed
her
deplorable
want
of
iron
by
bursting
into
tears
did
the
poor
heart
divine
what
might
be
then
enacting
perhaps
dimly
as
we
say
that
is
without
eyes
at
an
altar
stand
two
fair
young
creatures
ready
with
their
oaths
they
are
asked
to
fix
all
time
to
the
moment
and
they
do
so
if
there
is
hesitation
at
the
immense
undertaking
it
is
but
maidenly
she
conceives
as
little
mental
doubt
of
the
sanity
of
the
act
as
he
over
them
hangs
a
cool
young
curate
in
his
raiment
of
office
behind
are
two
apparently
lucid
people
distinguished
from
each
other
by
sex
and
age

foremost

bunch
of
simmering
black
satin
under
her
shadow
a
in
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
big
joy
swelling
out
his
chest
and
pert
satisfaction
cocking
his
head
these
be
they
who
stand
here
in
place
of
parents
to
the
young
couple
all
is
well
the
service
proceeds
firmly
the
bridegroom
tells
forth
his
words
this
hour
of
the
complacent
giant
at
least
is
his
and
that
he
means
to
hold
him
bound
through
the
eternities
men
may
hear
clearly
and
with
brave
modesty
speaks
she
no
less
firmly
though
her
body
trembles
her
voice
just
vibrating
while
the
tone
travels
on
like
a
smitten
vase
time
hears
sentence
pronounced
on
him
the
frail
hands
bind
his
huge
limbs
and
lock
the
chains
he
is
used
to
it
he
lets
them
do
as
they
will
then
comes
that
period
when
they
are
to
give
their
troth
to
each
other
the
man
with
his
right
hand
takes
the
woman
by
her
right
hand
the
woman
with
her
right
hand
takes
the
man
by
his
right
devils
dare
not
laugh
at
whom
angels
crowd
to
contemplate
their
hands
are
joined
their
blood
flows
as
one
stream
adam
and
fair
eve
front
the
generations
are
they
not
lovely
purer
fountains
of
life
were
never
in
two
bosoms
and
then
they
loose
their
hands
and
the
cool
curate
doth
bid
the
man
to
put
a
ring
on
the
woman
fourth
finger
counting
thumb
and
the
man
thrusts
his
hand
into
one
pocket
and
into
another
forward
and
back
many
times
into
all
his
pockets
he
remembers
that
he
felt
for
it
and
felt
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
when
in
the
gardens
and
his
hand
comes
forth
empty
and
the
man
is
ghastly
to
look
at
yet
though
angels
smile
shall
not
devils
laugh
the
curate
deliberates
the
black
satin
bunch
ceases
to
simmer
he
in
her
shadow
changes
from
a
beaming
to
an
inquisitive
sparrow
eyes
multiply
questions
lips
have
no
reply
time
ominously
shakes
his
chain
and
in
the
pause
a
sound
of
mockery
stings
their
ears
think
ye
a
hero
is
one
to
be
defeated
in
his
first
battle
look
at
the
clock
there
are
but
seven
minutes
to
the
stroke
of
the
celibate
hours
the
veteran
is
surely
lifting
his
two
hands
to
deliver
fire
and
his
shot
will
sunder
them
in
twain
so
nearly
united
all
the
jewellers
of
london
speeding
down
with
sacks
full
of
the
nuptial
circlet
can
not
save
them
the
battle
must
be
won
on
the
field
and
what
does
the
hero
now
it
is
an
inspiration
for
who
else
would
dream
of
such
a
reserve
in
the
rear
none
see
what
he
does
only
that
the
bunch
is
remonstratingly
agitated
stormily
shaken
and
subdued
and
as
though
the
menacing
cloud
had
opened
and
dropped
the
dear
token
from
the
skies
at
his
demand
he
produces
the
symbol
of
their
consent
and
the
service
proceeds
with
this
ring
i
thee
they
are
prayed
over
and
blest
for
good
or
for
ill
this
deed
is
done
the
names
are
registered
fees
fly
right
and
left
they
thank
and
salute
the
curate
whose
official
coolness
melts
into
a
smile
of
monastic
gallantry
the
beadle
on
the
steps
waves
off
a
gaping
world
as
they
issue
forth
bridegroom
and
bridesman
recklessly
scatter
gold
on
him
carriage
doors
are
banged
to
the
coachmen
drive
off
and
the
scene
closes
everybody
happy
chapter
xxx
and
the
next
moment
the
bride
is
weeping
as
if
she
would
dissolve
to
one
of
dian
virgin
fountains
from
the
clasp
of
the
she
has
nobly
preserved
the
mask
imposed
by
comedies
till
the
curtain
has
fallen
and
now
she
weeps
streams
with
tears
have
patience
o
impetuous
young
man
it
is
your
profession
to
be
a
hero
this
poor
heart
is
new
to
it
and
her
duties
involve
such
wild
acts
such
brigandage
such
terrors
and
tasks
she
is
quite
unnerved
she
did
you
honour
till
now
bear
with
her
now
she
does
not
cry
the
cry
of
ordinary
maidens
in
like
cases
while
the
struggle
went
on
her
tender
face
was
brave
but
alas
omens
are
against
her
she
holds
an
dreadful
one
on
that
fatal
fourth
finger
of
hers
which
has
coiled
itself
round
her
dream
of
delight
and
takes
her
in
its
clutch
like
a
horrid
serpent
and
yet
she
must
love
it
she
dares
not
part
from
it
she
must
love
and
hug
it
and
feed
on
its
strange
honey
and
all
the
bliss
it
gives
her
casts
all
the
deeper
shadow
on
what
is
to
come
say
is
it
not
enough
to
cause
feminine
apprehension
for
a
woman
to
be
married
in
another
woman
ring
you
are
amazons
ladies
at
saragossa
and
a
thousand
citadels
wherever
there
is
strife
and
time
is
to
be
taken
by
the
throat
then
shall
few
men
match
your
sublime
fury
but
what
if
you
see
a
vulture
visible
only
to
yourselves
hovering
over
the
house
you
are
gaily
led
by
the
torch
to
inhabit
will
you
not
crouch
and
be
cowards
as
for
the
hero
in
the
hour
of
victory
he
pays
no
heed
to
omens
he
does
his
best
to
win
his
darling
to
confidence
by
caresses
is
she
not
his
is
he
not
hers
and
why
when
the
battle
is
won
does
she
weep
does
she
regret
what
she
has
done
oh
never
never
her
soft
blue
eyes
assure
him
steadfast
love
seen
swimming
on
clear
depths
of
faith
in
them
through
the
shower
he
is
silenced
by
her
exceeding
beauty
and
sits
perplexed
waiting
for
the
shower
to
pass
alone
with
berry
in
her
bedroom
lucy
gave
tongue
to
her
distress
and
a
second
character
in
the
comedy
changed
her
face
o
berry
berry
what
has
happened
what
has
happened
my
darlin
child
the
bridal
berry
gazed
at
the
finger
of
doleful
joy
i
forgot
all
about
it
and
that
what
made
me
feel
so
queer
ever
since
then
i
been
seemin
as
if
i
was
myself
somehow
without
my
ring
dear
dear
what
a
wilful
young
gentleman
we
ai
a
match
for
men
in
that
state
lord
help
us
berry
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
lucy
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
what
do
you
think
of
it
berry
is
it
not
terrible
i
ca
say
i
should
liked
it
myself
my
dear
berry
candidly
responded
oh
why
why
why
did
it
happen
the
young
bride
bent
to
a
flood
of
fresh
tears
murmuring
that
she
felt
already
old
forsaken
have
you
got
a
comfort
in
your
religion
for
all
accidents
berry
inquired
none
for
this
i
know
it
wrong
to
cry
when
i
am
so
happy
i
hope
he
will
forgive
me
berry
vowed
her
bride
was
the
sweetest
softest
beautifulest
thing
in
life
i
cry
no
more
said
lucy
leave
me
berry
and
come
back
when
i
ring
she
drew
forth
a
little
silver
cross
and
fell
upon
her
knees
to
the
bed
berry
left
the
room
tiptoe
when
she
was
called
to
return
lucy
was
calm
and
tearless
and
smiled
kindly
to
her
it
over
now
she
said
berry
sedately
looked
for
her
ring
to
follow
he
does
not
wish
me
to
go
in
to
the
breakfast
you
have
prepared
berry
i
begged
to
be
excused
i
can
not
eat
berry
very
much
deplored
it
as
she
had
laid
out
a
superior
nuptial
breakfast
but
with
her
mind
on
her
ring
she
nodded
assentingly
we
shall
not
have
much
packing
to
do
mrs
berry
no
my
dear
it
pretty
well
all
done
we
are
going
to
the
isle
of
wight
mrs
berry
and
a
very
suitable
spot
ye
chose
my
dear
he
loves
the
sea
he
wishes
to
be
near
it
do
ye
cross
if
it
anyways
rough
my
dear
it
advisable
berry
sank
her
voice
to
say
do
ye
be
soft
and
give
way
to
him
there
or
you
both
be
repenting
it
lucy
had
only
been
staving
off
the
unpleasantness
she
had
to
speak
she
saw
berry
eyes
pursuing
her
ring
and
screwed
up
her
courage
at
last
mrs
berry
yes
my
dear
berry
you
shall
have
another
ring
another
my
dear
berry
did
not
comprehend
one
quite
enough
for
the
objeck
she
remarked
i
mean
lucy
touched
her
fourth
finger
i
can
not
part
with
this
she
looked
straight
at
berry
that
bewildered
creature
gazed
at
her
and
at
the
ring
till
she
had
thoroughly
exhausted
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
then
exclaimed
deary
me
now
you
do
say
that
you
to
be
married
again
in
your
own
religion
the
young
wife
repeated
i
can
never
part
with
it
but
my
dear
the
wretched
berry
wrung
her
hands
divided
between
compassion
and
a
sense
of
injury
my
dear
she
kept
expostulating
like
a
mute
i
know
all
that
you
would
say
berry
i
am
very
grieved
to
pain
you
it
is
mine
now
and
must
be
mine
i
can
not
give
it
back
there
she
sat
suddenly
developed
to
the
most
inflexible
little
heroine
in
the
three
kingdoms
from
her
first
perception
of
the
meaning
of
the
young
bride
words
berry
a
shrewd
physiognomist
knew
that
her
case
was
hopeless
unless
she
treated
her
as
she
herself
had
been
treated
and
seized
the
ring
by
force
of
arms
and
that
she
had
not
heart
for
what
she
gasped
faintly
one
own
lawful
you
give
back
to
a
body
because
it
is
mine
berry
it
was
yours
but
it
is
mine
now
you
shall
have
whatever
you
ask
for
but
that
pray
forgive
me
it
must
be
so
berry
rocked
on
her
chair
and
sounded
her
hands
together
it
amazed
her
that
this
soft
little
creature
could
be
thus
firm
she
tried
argument
do
ye
know
my
dear
it
the
fatalest
thing
you
inflictin
upon
me
reelly
do
ye
know
that
bein
bereft
of
one
own
lawful
ring
the
fatalest
thing
in
life
and
there
no
prosperity
after
it
for
what
stands
in
place
o
that
when
that
gone
my
dear
and
what
could
ye
give
me
to
compensate
a
body
for
the
loss
o
that
do
ye
know
oh
deary
me
the
little
bride
face
was
so
set
that
poor
berry
wailed
off
in
despair
i
know
it
said
lucy
i
know
it
all
i
know
what
i
do
to
you
dear
dear
berry
forgive
me
if
i
parted
with
my
ring
i
know
it
would
be
fatal
so
this
fair
young
freebooter
took
possession
of
her
argument
as
well
as
her
ring
berry
racked
her
distracted
wits
for
a
further
appeal
but
my
child
she
you
do
understand
it
ai
as
you
think
it
ai
a
hurt
to
you
now
not
a
bit
it
ai
it
makes
no
difference
now
any
ring
does
while
the
wearer
a
maid
and
your
richard
will
find
the
very
ring
he
intended
for
ye
and
of
course
that
the
one
you
wear
as
his
wife
it
all
the
same
now
my
dear
it
no
shame
to
a
maid
now
do
now
do
there
a
darlin
wheedling
availed
as
little
as
argument
berry
said
lucy
you
know
what
my
he
spoke
this
ring
i
thee
it
was
with
this
ring
then
how
could
it
be
with
another
berry
was
constrained
despondently
to
acknowledge
that
was
logic
she
hit
upon
an
artful
conjecture
wo
it
be
unlucky
your
wearin
of
the
ring
which
served
me
so
think
o
that
it
may
it
may
it
may
cried
lucy
and
ar
you
rushin
into
it
my
dear
berry
lucy
said
again
it
was
this
ring
it
can
not
it
never
can
be
another
it
was
this
what
it
brings
me
i
must
bear
i
shall
wear
it
till
i
die
then
what
am
i
to
do
the
woman
groaned
what
shall
i
tell
my
husband
when
he
come
back
to
me
and
see
i
got
a
new
ring
for
him
wo
that
be
a
welcome
quoth
lucy
how
can
he
know
it
is
not
the
same
in
a
plain
gold
ring
you
never
see
so
keen
a
eyed
man
in
joolry
as
my
berry
returned
his
solitary
spouse
not
know
my
dear
why
any
one
would
know
got
eyes
in
his
head
there
as
much
difference
in
as
there
in
wedding
people
now
do
pray
be
reasonable
my
own
sweet
pray
do
not
ask
me
pleads
lucy
pray
do
think
better
of
it
urges
berry
pray
pray
mrs
berry
pleads
and
not
leave
your
old
berry
all
forlorn
just
when
you
so
happy
indeed
i
would
not
you
dear
kind
old
creature
lucy
faltered
berry
thought
she
had
her
just
when
you
going
to
be
the
happiest
wife
on
earth
all
you
want
yours
she
pursued
the
tender
strain
a
handsome
young
gentleman
love
and
fortune
smilin
on
ye
lucy
rose
up
berry
she
said
i
think
we
must
not
lose
time
in
getting
ready
or
he
will
be
impatient
poor
berry
surveyed
her
in
abject
wonder
from
the
edge
of
her
chair
dignity
and
resolve
were
in
the
ductile
form
she
had
hitherto
folded
under
her
wing
in
an
hour
the
heroine
had
risen
to
the
measure
of
the
hero
without
being
exactly
aware
what
creature
she
was
dealing
with
berry
acknowledged
to
herself
it
was
not
one
of
the
common
run
and
sighed
and
submitted
it
like
a
divorce
that
it
is
she
sobbed
after
putting
the
corners
of
her
apron
to
her
eyes
berry
bustled
humbly
about
the
packing
then
lucy
whose
heart
was
full
to
her
came
and
kissed
her
and
berry
bumped
down
and
regularly
cried
this
over
she
had
recourse
to
fatalism
i
suppose
it
was
to
be
my
dear
it
my
punishment
for
meddlin
such
matters
no
i
not
sorry
bless
ye
both
who
thought
you
was
so
wilful
you
that
any
one
might
have
taken
for
one
of
the
softs
you
a
pair
my
dear
indeed
you
are
you
was
made
to
meet
but
we
must
show
him
we
been
men
do
like
it
when
they
happy
let
wash
our
faces
and
try
to
bear
our
lot
so
saying
the
bunch
careened
to
a
renewed
deluge
she
deserved
some
sympathy
for
if
it
is
sad
to
be
married
in
another
person
ring
how
much
sadder
to
have
one
own
old
accustomed
lawful
ring
violently
torn
off
one
finger
and
eternally
severed
from
one
but
where
you
have
heroes
and
heroines
these
terrible
complications
ensue
they
had
now
both
fought
their
battle
of
the
ring
and
with
equal
honour
and
success
in
the
chamber
of
banquet
richard
was
giving
ripton
his
last
directions
though
it
was
a
private
wedding
berry
had
prepared
a
sumptuous
breakfast
chickens
offered
their
breasts
pies
hinted
savoury
secrets
things
mystic
in
a
mash
with
gallic
appellatives
jellies
creams
fruits
strewed
the
table
as
a
tower
in
the
midst
the
cake
colossal
the
priestly
vesture
of
its
nuptial
white
relieved
by
hymeneal
splendours
many
hours
much
labour
and
anxiety
of
mind
berry
had
expended
upon
this
breakfast
and
why
there
is
one
who
comes
to
all
feasts
that
have
their
basis
in
folly
whom
criminals
of
trained
instinct
are
careful
to
provide
against
who
will
speak
and
whose
hateful
voice
must
somehow
be
silenced
while
the
feast
is
going
on
this
personage
is
the
philosopher
berry
knew
him
she
knew
that
he
would
come
she
provided
against
him
in
the
manner
she
thought
most
efficacious
that
is
by
cheating
her
eyes
and
intoxicating
her
conscience
with
the
due
and
proper
glories
incident
to
weddings
where
fathers
dilate
mothers
collapse
and
marriage
settlements
are
flourished
on
high
by
the
family
lawyer
and
had
there
been
no
show
of
the
kind
to
greet
her
on
her
return
from
the
church
she
would
and
she
foresaw
she
would
have
stared
at
squalor
and
emptiness
and
repented
her
work
the
philosopher
would
have
laid
hold
of
her
by
the
ear
and
called
her
bad
names
entrenched
behind
a
so
legitimately
adorned
berry
defied
him
in
the
presence
of
that
cake
he
dared
not
speak
above
a
whisper
and
there
were
wines
to
drown
him
in
should
he
still
think
of
protesting
fiery
wines
and
cool
claret
sent
purposely
by
the
bridegroom
for
the
delectation
of
his
friend
for
one
good
hour
therefore
the
labour
of
many
hours
kept
him
dumb
ripton
was
fortifying
himself
so
as
to
forget
him
altogether
and
the
world
as
well
till
the
next
morning
ripton
was
excited
overdone
with
delight
he
had
already
finished
one
bottle
and
listened
pleasantly
flushed
to
his
emphatic
and
more
abstemious
chief
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
listen
and
to
drink
the
hero
would
not
allow
him
to
shout
victory
or
hear
a
word
of
toasts
and
as
from
the
quantity
of
oil
poured
on
it
his
eloquence
was
becoming
a
natural
force
in
his
bosom
the
poor
fellow
was
afflicted
with
a
sort
of
elephantiasis
of
suppressed
emotion
at
times
he
from
his
chair
and
fell
vacuously
into
it
again
or
he
chuckled
in
the
face
of
weighty
instructions
tapped
his
chest
stretched
his
arms
yawned
and
in
short
behaved
so
singularly
that
richard
observed
it
and
said
on
my
soul
i
do
think
you
know
a
word
i
saying
every
word
ricky
ripton
spirted
through
the
opening
i
going
down
to
your
governor
and
tell
him
sir
austin
here
your
only
chance
of
being
a
happy
father
no
no
oh
do
you
fear
me
ricky
i
shall
talk
the
old
gentleman
over
his
chief
said
look
here
you
had
better
not
go
down
go
down
the
first
thing
by
the
six
train
give
him
my
letter
listen
to
me
give
him
my
letter
and
do
speak
a
word
till
he
speaks

again
shouted
an
angel
throwing
up
the
heels
of
his
second
bottle
he
said
you
may
trust
your
friend
richard
aha
when
you
pulled
at
old
berry
i
did
know
what
was
up
i
do
wish
you
let
me
drink
her
health
here
to
penelope
said
richard
just
wetting
his
mouth
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
a
couple
of
dire
organs
each
grinding
the
same
tune
and
a
itinerant
band
from
which
not
the
secretest
veiled
wedding
can
escape
worked
harmoniously
without
in
the
production
of
discord
and
the
noise
acting
on
his
nervous
state
made
him
begin
to
fume
and
send
in
messages
for
his
bride
by
the
maid
by
and
by
the
lovely
young
bride
presented
herself
dressed
for
her
journey
and
smiling
from
stained
eyes
berry
was
requested
to
drink
some
wine
which
ripton
poured
out
for
her
enabling
berry
thereby
to
measure
his
condition
the
bride
now
kissed
berry
and
berry
kissed
the
bridegroom
on
the
plea
of
her
softness
lucy
gave
ripton
her
hand
with
a
musical
thompson
and
her
extreme
graciousness
made
him
just
sensible
enough
to
sit
down
before
he
murmured
his
fervent
hopes
for
her
happiness
i
shall
take
good
care
of
him
said
berry
focussing
her
eyes
to
the
comprehension
of
the
company
farewell
penelope
cried
richard
i
shall
tell
the
police
everywhere
to
look
out
for
your
lord
oh
my
dears
and
heaven
bless
ye
both
berry
quavered
touched
with
compunction
at
the
thoughts
of
approaching
loneliness
ripton
his
mouth
drawn
like
a
bow
to
his
ears
brought
up
the
rear
to
the
carriage
receiving
a
fair
slap
on
the
cheek
from
an
old
shoe
precipitated
by
berry
enthusiastic
female
domestic
white
handkerchiefs
were
waved
the
adieux
had
fallen
to
signs
they
were
off
then
did
a
thought
of
such
urgency
illumine
berry
that
she
telegraphed
hand
in
air
awakening
ripton
lungs
for
the
coachman
to
stop
and
ran
back
to
the
house
richard
chafed
to
be
gone
but
at
his
bride
intercession
he
consented
to
wait
presently
they
beheld
the
old
bunch
stream
through
the
down
the
bit
of
garden
and
up
the
astonished
street
halting
panting
capless
at
the
carriage
door
a
book
in
her
hand
a
steamy
greasy
book
which
at
the
same
time
calling
out
in
breathless
jerks
there
never
ye
mind
looks
i
ai
got
a
new
one
read
it
and
do
ye
forget
it
she
discharged
into
lucy
lap
and
retreated
to
the
railings
a
signal
for
the
coachman
to
drive
away
for
good
how
richard
laughed
at
the
berry
bridal
gift
lucy
too
lost
the
omen
at
her
heart
as
she
glanced
at
the
title
of
the
volume
it
was
kitchener
on
domestic
cookery
chapter
xxxi
general
withdrawing
of
heads
from
emigration
of
organs
and
bands
and
a
relaxed
atmosphere
in
the
circle
of
berry
abode
proved
that
dan
cupid
had
veritably
flown
to
suck
the
life
of
fresh
regions
with
a
pensive
mind
she
grasped
ripton
arm
to
regulate
his
steps
and
returned
to
the
room
where
her
creditor
awaited
her
in
the
interval
he
had
stormed
her
undefended
fortress
the
cake
from
which
altitude
he
shook
a
dolorous
head
at
the
guilty
woman
she
smoothed
her
excited
apron
sighing
let
no
one
imagine
that
she
regretted
her
complicity
she
was
ready
to
cry
torrents
but
there
must
be
absolute
castigation
before
this
criminal
shall
conceive
the
sense
of
regret
and
probably
then
she
will
cling
to
her
wickedness
the
more
such
is
the
born
pagan
tenacity
berry
sighed
and
gave
him
back
his
shake
of
the
head
o
you
wanton
improvident
creature
said
he
o
you
very
wise
old
gentleman
said
she
he
asked
her
the
thing
she
had
been
doing
she
enlightened
him
with
the
fatalist
reply
he
sounded
a
bogey
alarm
of
contingent
grave
results
she
retreated
to
the
entrenched
camp
of
the
fact
she
had
helped
to
make
it
done
she
exclaimed
how
could
she
regret
what
she
felt
comfort
to
know
was
done
convinced
that
events
alone
could
stamp
a
mark
on
such
stubborn
flesh
he
determined
to
wait
for
them
and
crouched
silent
on
the
cake
with
one
finger
downwards
at
ripton
incision
there
showing
a
crumbling
chasm
and
gloomy
rich
recess
the
eloquent
indication
was
understood
dear
dear
cried
berry
what
a
heap
o
cake
and
no
one
to
send
it
to
ripton
had
resumed
his
seat
by
the
table
and
his
embrace
of
the
claret
clear
ideas
of
satisfaction
had
left
him
and
resolved
to
a
boiling
geysir
of
indistinguishable
transports
he
bubbled
and
waggled
and
nodded
amicably
to
nothing
and
successfully
though
not
without
effort
preserved
his
uppermost
member
from
the
seductions
of
the
nymph
gravitation
who
was
on
the
for
his
whole
length
shortly
ha
ha
he
shouted
about
a
minute
after
berry
had
spoken
and
almost
abandoned
himself
to
the
nymph
on
the
spot
berry
words
had
just
reached
his
wits
why
do
you
laugh
young
man
she
inquired
familiar
and
motherly
on
account
of
his
condition
ripton
laughed
louder
and
caught
his
chest
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
his
nose
on
a
chicken
that
goo
he
said
recovering
and
rocking
under
berry
eyes
no
friend
i
did
not
say
no
friend
she
remarked
i
said
no
one
meanin
i
know
not
where
for
to
send
it
to
ripton
response
to
this
was
you
put
a
griffin
on
that
cake
wheatsheaves
each
side
his
crest
berry
said
sweetly
oldest

waved
ripton
yes
berry
encouraged
him
on
you
think
he
richards
we
oblige
be
very
close
and
she
the
most
lovely
if
i
hear
man
say
thing
her
you
need
for
to
cry
over
her
young
man
said
berry
i
wanted
for
to
drink
their
right
healths
by
their
right
names
and
then
go
about
my
day
work
and
i
do
hope
you
wo
keep
me
ripton
stood
bolt
upright
at
her
words
you
do
he
said
and
filling
a
bumper
he
with
cheerfully
vinous
articulation
and
glibness
of
tongue
proposed
the
health
of
richard
and
lucy
feverel
of
raynham
abbey
and
that
mankind
should
not
require
an
expeditious
example
of
the
way
to
accept
the
inspiring
toast
he
drained
his
bumper
at
a
gulp
it
finished
him
the
farthing
rushlight
of
his
reason
leapt
and
expired
he
tumbled
to
the
sofa
and
there
stretched
some
minutes
subsequent
to
ripton
signalization
of
his
devotion
to
the
bridal
pair
berry
maid
entered
the
room
to
say
that
a
gentleman
was
inquiring
below
after
the
young
gentleman
who
had
departed
and
found
her
mistress
with
a
tottering
wineglass
in
her
hand
exhibiting
every
symptom
of
unconsoled
hysterics
her
mouth
gaped
as
if
the
fell
creditor
had
her
by
the
swallow
she
ejaculated
with
horrible
exultation
that
she
had
been
and
done
it
as
her
disastrous
aspect
seemed
to
testify
and
her
evident
but
inexplicable
access
of
misery
induced
the
sympathetic
maid
to
tender
those
caressing
words
that
were
all
berry
wanted
to
go
off
into
the
fit
without
delay
and
she
had
already
given
the
preluding
demoniac
ironic
outburst
when
the
maid
called
heaven
to
witness
that
the
gentleman
would
hear
her
upon
which
berry
violently
controlled
her
bosom
and
ordered
that
he
should
be
shown
upstairs
instantly
to
see
her
the
wretch
she
was
she
repeated
the
injunction
the
maid
did
as
she
was
told
and
berry
wishing
first
to
see
herself
as
she
was
mutely
accosted
the
and
tried
to
look
a
very
little
better
she
dropped
a
shawl
on
ripton
and
was
settled
smoothing
her
agitation
when
her
visitor
was
announced
the
gentleman
was
adrian
harley
an
interview
with
tom
bakewell
had
put
him
on
the
track
and
now
a
momentary
survey
of
the
table
and
its
vestured
cake
made
him
whistle
berry
plaintively
begged
him
to
do
her
the
favour
to
be
seated
a
fine
morning
said
adrian
it
have
been
berry
answered
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
window
and
gulping
as
if
to
get
her
heart
down
from
her
mouth
a
very
fine
spring
pursued
adrian
calmly
anatomizing
her
countenance
berry
smothered
an
adjective
to
weather
on
a
deep
sigh
her
wretchedness
was
palpable
in
proportion
to
it
adrian
waned
cheerful
and
brisk
he
divined
enough
of
the
business
to
see
that
there
was
some
strange
intelligence
to
be
fished
out
of
the
culprit
who
sat
compressing
hysterics
before
him
and
as
he
was
never
more
in
his
element
than
when
he
had
a
sinner
and
a
repentant
prostrate
abject
sinner
in
hand
his
affable
countenance
might
well
deceive
poor
berry
i
presume
these
are
thompson
lodgings
he
remarked
with
a
look
at
the
table
berry
head
and
the
whites
of
her
eyes
informed
him
that
they
were
not
thompson
lodgings
no
said
adrian
and
threw
a
carelessly
inquisitive
eye
about
him
feverel
is
out
i
suppose
a
convulsive
start
at
the
name
and
two
corroborating
hands
dropped
on
her
knees
formed
berry
reply
feverel
man
continued
adrian
told
me
i
should
be
certain
to
find
him
here
i
thought
he
would
be
with
his
friend
thompson
too
late
i
perceive
their
entertainment
is
over
i
fancy
you
have
been
having
a
party
of
them
here
a
bachelors
breakfast
in
the
presence
of
that
cake
this
observation
seemed
to
mask
an
irony
so
shrewd
that
berry
could
barely
contain
herself
she
felt
she
must
speak
making
her
face
as
deplorably
propitiating
as
she
could
she
began
sir
may
i
beg
for
to
know
your
name
harley
accorded
her
request
groaning
in
the
clutch
of
a
pitiless
truth
she
continued
and
you
are
harley
that
was
oh
and
you
come
for
richard
feverel
was
the
gentleman
harley
had
come
for
oh
and
it
no
mistake
and
he
of
raynham
abbey
berry
inquired
adrian
very
much
amused
assured
her
that
he
was
born
and
bred
there
his
father
sir
austin
wailed
the
bunch
from
behind
her
handkerchief
adrian
verified
richard
descent
oh
then
what
have
i
been
and
done
she
cried
and
stared
blankly
at
her
visitor
i
been
and
married
my
baby
i
been
and
married
the
bread
out
of
my
own
mouth
o
harley
harley
i
knew
you
when
you
was
a
boy
that
big
and
wore
jackets
and
all
of
you
and
it
my
softness
that
my
ruin
for
i
never
can
resist
a
man
asking
look
at
that
cake
mr
harley
adrian
followed
her
directions
quite
coolly
he
said
it
is
mr
harley
did
you
make
it
yourself
the
quiet
ease
of
the
question
overwhelmed
berry
and
upset
that
train
of
symbolic
representations
by
which
she
was
seeking
to
make
him
guess
the
catastrophe
and
spare
her
the
furnace
of
confession
i
did
not
make
it
myself
harley
she
replied
it
a
bought
cake
and
i
a
lost
woman
little
i
dreamed
when
i
had
him
in
my
arms
a
baby
that
i
should
some
day
be
marrying
him
out
of
my
own
house
i
little
dreamed
that
oh
why
did
he
come
to
me
do
you
remember
his
old
nurse
when
he
was
a
baby
in
arms
that
went
away
so
sudden
and
no
fault
of
hers
harley
the
very
mornin
after
the
night
you
got
into
benson
cellar
and
got
so
tipsy
on
his
madeary
i
remember
it
as
clear
as
yesterday
and
benson
was
that
angry
he
threatened
to
use
the
whip
to
you
and
i
helped
put
you
to
bed
i
that
very
woman
adrian
smiled
placidly
at
these
reminiscences
of
his
guileless
youthful
life
well
well
he
said
he
would
bring
her
to
the
furnace
wo
you
see
it
all
kind
sir
berry
appealed
to
him
in
pathetic
dumb
show
doubtless
by
this
time
adrian
did
see
it
all
and
was
mentally
cursing
at
folly
and
reckoning
the
immediate
consequences
but
he
looked
uninstructed
his
peculiar
was
undisturbed
his
comfortable
posture
was
the
same
well
he
spurred
her
on
berry
burst
forth
it
were
done
this
mornin
harley
in
the
church
at
eleven
of
the
clock
or
twenty
to
by
licence
adrian
was
now
obliged
to
comprehend
a
case
of
matrimony
oh
he
said
like
one
who
is
as
hard
as
facts
and
as
little
to
be
moved
somebody
was
married
this
morning
was
it
thompson
or
mr
feverel
berry
shuffled
up
to
ripton
and
removed
the
shawl
from
him
saying
do
he
look
like
a
new
married
bridegroom
mr
harley
adrian
inspected
the
oblivious
ripton
with
philosophic
gravity
this
young
gentleman
was
at
church
this
morning
he
asked
oh
quite
reasonable
and
proper
then
berry
begged
him
to
understand
of
course
adrian
lifted
and
let
fall
the
stupid
inanimate
limbs
of
the
gone
wretch
puckering
his
mouth
queerly
you
were
all
reasonable
and
proper
the
principal
male
performer
then
is
my
cousin
feverel
he
was
married
by
you
this
morning
by
licence
at
your
parish
church
and
came
here
and
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
and
left
intoxicated
berry
flew
out
he
never
drink
a
drop
sir
a
more
moderate
young
gentleman
you
never
see
oh
do
ye
think
that
now
harley
he
was
as
upright
and
master
of
his
mind
as
you
be
ay
the
wise
youth
nodded
thanks
to
her
for
the
comparison
i
mean
the
other
form
of
intoxication
berry
sighed
she
could
say
nothing
on
that
score
adrian
desired
her
to
sit
down
and
compose
herself
and
tell
him
circumstantially
what
had
been
done
she
obeyed
in
utter
perplexity
at
his
perfectly
composed
demeanour
berry
as
her
recital
declared
was
no
other
than
that
identical
woman
who
once
in
old
days
had
dared
to
behold
the
baronet
behind
his
mask
and
had
ever
since
lived
in
exile
from
the
raynham
world
on
a
little
pension
regularly
paid
to
her
as
an
indemnity
she
was
that
woman
and
the
thought
of
it
made
her
almost
accuse
providence
for
the
betraying
excess
of
softness
it
had
endowed
her
with
how
was
she
to
recognize
her
baby
grown
a
man
he
came
in
a
feigned
name
not
a
word
of
the
family
was
mentioned
he
came
like
an
ordinary
mortal
though
she
felt
something
more
than
ordinary
to
him
she
knew
she
did
he
came
bringing
a
beautiful
young
lady
and
on
what
grounds
could
she
turn
her
back
on
them
why
seeing
that
all
was
chaste
and
legal
why
should
she
interfere
to
make
them
unhappy
so
few
the
chances
of
happiness
in
this
world
berry
related
the
seizure
of
her
ring
one
wrench
said
the
sobbing
culprit
one
and
my
ring
was
off
she
had
no
suspicions
and
the
task
of
writing
her
name
in
the
book
had
been
too
enacting
for
a
thought
upon
the
other
signatures
i
daresay
you
were
exceedingly
sorry
for
what
you
had
done
said
adrian
indeed
sir
moaned
berry
i
were
and
am
and
would
do
your
best
to
rectify
the
mischief
eh
indeed
and
indeed
sir
i
would
she
protested
as
of
course
you
should
knowing
the
family
where
may
these
lunatics
have
gone
to
spend
the
moon
berry
swimmingly
replied
to
the
isle
i
do
quite
know
sir
she
snapped
the
indication
short
and
jumped
out
of
the
pit
she
had
fallen
into
repentant
as
she
might
be
those
dears
should
not
be
pursued
and
cruelly
balked
of
their
young
bliss
if
you
please
harley
not
a
pleasant
spot
adrian
observed
smiling
at
his
easy
prey
by
a
measurement
of
dates
he
discovered
that
the
bridegroom
had
brought
his
bride
to
the
house
on
the
day
he
had
quitted
raynham
and
this
was
enough
to
satisfy
adrian
mind
that
there
had
been
concoction
and
chicanery
chance
probably
had
brought
him
to
the
old
woman
chance
certainly
had
not
brought
him
to
the
young
one
very
well
he
said
in
answer
to
her
petitions
for
his
favourable
offices
with
sir
austin
in
behalf
of
her
little
pension
and
the
bridal
pair
i
will
tell
him
you
were
only
a
blind
agent
in
the
affair
being
naturally
soft
and
that
you
trust
he
will
bless
the
consummation
he
will
be
in
town
morning
but
one
of
you
two
must
see
him
an
emetic
kindly
administered
will
set
our
friend
here
on
his
legs
a
bath
and
a
clean
shirt
and
he
might
go
i
do
see
why
your
name
should
appear
at
all
brush
him
up
and
send
him
to
bellingham
by
the
seven
train
he
will
find
his
way
to
raynham
he
knows
the
neighbourhood
best
in
the
dark
let
him
go
and
state
the
case
remember
one
of
you
must
go
with
this
fair
prospect
of
leaving
a
choice
of
a
perdition
between
the
couple
of
unfortunates
for
them
to
fight
and
lose
all
their
virtues
over
adrian
said
good
morning
berry
touchingly
arrested
him
you
wo
refuse
a
piece
of
his
cake
mr
harley
oh
dear
no
adrian
turned
to
the
cake
with
alacrity
i
shall
claim
a
very
large
piece
richard
has
a
great
many
friends
who
will
rejoice
to
eat
his
cut
me
a
fair
quarter
berry
put
it
in
paper
if
you
please
i
shall
be
delighted
to
carry
it
to
them
and
apportion
it
equitably
according
to
their
several
degrees
of
relationship
berry
cut
the
cake
somehow
as
she
sliced
through
it
the
sweetness
and
hapless
innocence
of
the
bride
was
presented
to
her
and
she
launched
into
eulogies
of
lucy
and
clearly
showed
how
little
she
regretted
her
conduct
she
vowed
that
they
seemed
made
for
each
other
that
both
were
beautiful
both
had
spirit
both
were
innocent
and
to
part
them
or
make
them
unhappy
would
be
berry
wrought
herself
to
cry
aloud
oh
such
a
pity
adrian
listened
to
it
as
the
expression
of
a
opinion
he
took
the
huge
quarter
of
cake
nodded
multitudinous
promises
and
left
berry
to
bless
his
good
heart
so
dies
the
system
was
adrian
comment
in
the
street
and
now
let
prophets
roar
he
dies
respectably
in
a
which
is
more
than
i
should
have
foretold
of
the
monster
meantime
he
gave
the
cake
a
dramatic
tap
i
go
sow
nightmares
chapter
xxxii
adrian
really
bore
the
news
he
had
heard
with
creditable
disinterestedness
and
admirable
repression
of
anything
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
philosopher
when
one
has
attained
that
felicitous
point
of
wisdom
from
which
one
sees
all
mankind
to
be
fools
the
diminutive
objects
may
make
what
new
moves
they
please
one
does
not
marvel
at
them
their
sedateness
is
as
comical
as
their
frolic
and
their
frenzies
more
comical
still
on
this
intellectual
eminence
the
wise
youth
had
built
his
castle
and
he
had
lived
in
it
from
an
early
period
astonishment
never
shook
the
foundations
nor
did
envy
of
greater
heights
tempt
him
to
relinquish
the
security
of
his
stronghold
for
he
saw
none
jugglers
he
saw
running
up
ladders
that
overtopped
him
and
scaling
the
empyrean
but
the
former
came
precipitately
down
again
and
the
latter
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
while
he
remained
tranquil
on
his
solid
unambitious
ground
fitting
his
morality
to
the
laws
his
conscience
to
his
morality
his
comfort
to
his
conscience
not
that
voluntarily
he
cut
himself
off
from
his
fellows
on
the
contrary
his
sole
amusement
was
their
society
alone
he
was
rather
dull
as
a
man
who
beholds
but
one
thing
must
naturally
be
study
of
the
animated
varieties
of
that
one
thing
excited
him
sufficiently
to
think
life
a
pleasant
play
and
the
faculties
he
had
forfeited
to
hold
his
elevated
position
he
could
serenely
enjoy
by
contemplation
of
them
in
others
thus
wonder
at
master
richard
madness
though
he
himself
did
not
experience
it
he
was
eager
to
mark
the
effect
on
his
beloved
relatives
as
he
carried
along
his
vindictive
hunch
of
cake
he
shaped
out
their
different
attitudes
of
amaze
bewilderment
horror
passing
by
some
personal
chagrin
in
the
prospect
for
his
patron
had
projected
a
journey
commencing
with
paris
culminating
on
the
alps
and
lapsing
in
rome
a
delightful
journey
to
show
richard
the
highways
of
history
and
tear
him
from
the
risk
of
further
ignoble
fascinations
that
his
spirit
might
be
altogether
bathed
in
freshness
and
revived
this
had
been
planned
during
richard
absence
to
surprise
him
now
the
dream
of
travel
was
to
adrian
what
the
love
of
woman
is
to
the
race
of
young
men
it
supplanted
that
foolishness
it
was
his
romance
as
we
say
that
buoyant
anticipation
on
which
in
youth
we
ride
the
airs
and
which
as
we
wax
older
and
too
heavy
for
our
atmosphere
hardens
to
the
hobby
which
if
an
obstinate
animal
is
a
safer
horse
and
conducts
man
at
a
slower
pace
to
the
sexton
adrian
had
never
travelled
he
was
aware
that
his
romance
was
earthly
and
had
discomforts
only
to
be
evaded
by
the
one
potent
talisman
possessed
by
his
patron
his
alp
would
hardly
be
grand
to
him
without
an
obsequious
landlord
in
the
foreground
he
must
recline
on
mammon
imperial
cushions
in
order
to
moralize
becomingly
on
the
ancient
world
the
search
for
pleasure
at
the
expense
of
discomfort
as
frantic
lovers
woo
their
mistresses
to
partake
the
shelter
of
a
but
and
batten
on
a
crust
adrian
deemed
the
bitterness
of
beggarliness
let
his
sweet
mistress
be
given
him
in
the
pomp
and
splendour
due
to
his
superior
emotions
or
not
at
all
consequently
the
wise
youth
had
long
nursed
an
ineffectual
passion
and
it
argued
a
great
nature
in
him
that
at
the
moment
when
his
wishes
were
to
be
crowned
he
should
look
with
such
slight
touches
of
spleen
at
the
gorgeous
composite
fabric
of
parisian
cookery
and
roman
antiquities
crumbling
into
unsubstantial
mockery
assuredly
very
few
even
of
the
philosophers
would
have
turned
away
uncomplainingly
to
meaner
delights
the
moment
after
hippias
received
the
first
portion
of
the
cake
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
in
his
hotel
reading
he
had
fought
down
his
breakfast
with
more
than
usual
success
and
was
looking
forward
to
his
dinner
at
the
foreys
with
less
than
usual
timidity
ah
glad
you
come
adrian
he
said
and
expanded
his
chest
i
was
afraid
i
should
have
to
ride
down
this
is
kind
of
you
we
walk
down
together
through
the
park
it
absolutely
dangerous
to
walk
alone
in
these
streets
my
opinion
is
that
lasts
all
through
the
year
now
and
will
till
legislation
puts
a
stop
to
it
i
give
you
my
word
i
slipped
on
a
piece
of
yesterday
afternoon
in
piccadilly
and
i
thought
i
was
down
i
saved
myself
by
a
miracle
you
have
an
appetite
i
hope
asked
adrian
i
think
i
shall
get
one
after
a
bit
of
a
walk
chirped
hippias
yes
i
think
i
feel
hungry
now
charmed
to
hear
it
said
adrian
and
began
unpinning
his
parcel
on
his
knees
how
should
you
define
folly
he
checked
the
process
to
inquire
hm
hippias
meditated
he
prided
himself
on
being
oracular
when
such
questions
were
addressed
to
him
i
think
i
should
define
it
to
be
a
slide
very
good
definition
in
other
words
a
piece
of
once
on
it
your
life
and
limbs
are
in
danger
and
you
are
saved
by
a
miracle
you
must
present
that
to
the
pilgrim
and
the
monument
of
folly
what
would
that
be
hippias
meditated
anew
all
the
human
race
on
one
another
shoulders
he
chuckled
at
the
sweeping
sourness
of
the
instance
very
good
adrian
applauded
or
in
default
of
that
some
symbol
of
the
thing
say
such
as
this
of
which
i
have
here
brought
you
a
chip
adrian
displayed
the
quarter
of
the
cake
this
is
the
monument
made
portable
eh
cake
cried
hippias
retreating
to
his
chair
to
dramatize
his
intense
disgust
you
right
of
them
that
eat
it
if
i
if
i
do
mistake
he
peered
at
it
the
noxious
composition
bedizened
in
that
way
is
what
they
call
it
arrant
poison
who
is
it
you
want
to
kill
what
are
you
carrying
such
stuff
about
for
adrian
rang
the
bell
for
a
knife
to
present
you
with
your
due
and
proper
portion
you
will
have
friends
and
relatives
and
ca
be
saved
from
them
not
even
by
miracle
it
is
a
habit
which
exhibits
perhaps
the
unconscious
inherent
cynicism
of
the
human
mind
for
people
who
consider
that
they
have
reached
the
acme
of
mundane
felicity
to
distribute
this
token
of
esteem
to
their
friends
with
the
object
probably
he
took
the
knife
from
a
waiter
and
went
to
the
table
to
slice
the
cake
of
enabling
those
friends
these
edifices
require
very
delicate
incision
each
particular
currant
and
subtle
condiment
hangs
to
its
neighbour
a
is
evidently
the
most
highly
civilized
of
cakes
and
partakes
of
the
evils
as
well
as
the
advantages
of
civilization
i
was
saying
they
send
us
these
no
doubt
we
shall
have
to
weigh
out
the
crumbs
if
each
is
to
have
his
fair
share
that
we
may
the
better
estimate
their
state
of
bliss
by
passing
some
hours
in
purgatory
this
as
far
as
i
can
apportion
it
without
weights
and
scales
is
your
share
my
uncle
he
pushed
the
corner
of
the
table
bearing
the
cake
towards
hippias
get
away
hippias
vehemently
motioned
and
started
from
his
chair
i
have
none
of
it
i
tell
you
it
death
it
fifty
times
worse
than
that
beastly
compound
christmas
pudding
what
fool
has
been
doing
this
then
who
dares
send
me
cake
me
it
an
insult
you
are
not
compelled
to
eat
any
before
dinner
said
adrian
pointing
the
corner
of
the
table
after
him
but
your
share
you
must
take
and
appear
to
consume
one
who
has
done
so
much
to
bring
about
the
marriage
can
not
in
conscience
refuse
his
allotment
of
the
fruits
maidens
i
hear
first
cook
it
under
their
pillows
and
extract
nuptial
dreams
therefrom
said
to
be
of
a
lighter
class
taken
that
way
it
a
capital
cake
and
upon
my
honour
you
have
helped
to
make
it
you
have
indeed
so
here
it
is
the
table
again
went
at
hippias
he
ran
nimbly
round
it
and
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
exhausted
crying
there
my
appetite
gone
for
then
shall
i
tell
richard
that
you
wo
touch
a
morsel
of
his
cake
said
adrian
leaning
on
his
two
hands
over
the
table
and
looking
at
his
uncle
richard
yes
your
nephew
my
cousin
richard
your
companion
since
you
been
in
town
he
married
you
know
married
this
morning
at
kensington
parish
church
by
licence
at
eleven
of
the
clock
or
twenty
to
married
and
gone
to
spend
his
honeymoon
in
the
isle
of
wight
a
very
delectable
place
for
a
month
residence
i
have
to
announce
to
you
that
thanks
to
your
assistance
the
experiment
is
launched
sir
richard
married
there
was
something
to
think
and
to
say
in
objection
to
it
but
the
wits
of
poor
hippias
were
softened
by
the
shock
his
hand
travelled
to
his
forehead
spread
out
to
smooth
the
surface
of
that
seat
of
reason
and
then
fell
surely
you
knew
all
about
it
you
were
so
anxious
to
have
him
in
town
under
your
charge
married
hippias
jumped
up
he
had
it
why
he
under
age
he
an
infant
so
he
is
but
the
infant
is
not
the
less
married
fib
like
a
man
and
pay
your
fee
what
does
it
matter
any
one
who
is
breeched
can
obtain
a
licence
in
our
noble
country
and
the
interests
of
morality
demand
that
it
should
not
be
difficult
is
it
true
can
you
persuade
anybody
that
you
have
known
nothing
about
it
ha
infamous
joke
i
wish
sir
you
would
play
your
pranks
on
somebody
else
said
hippias
sternly
as
he
sank
back
on
the
sofa
you
done
me
up
for
the
day
i
can
assure
you
adrian
sat
down
to
instil
belief
by
gentle
degrees
and
put
an
artistic
finish
to
the
work
he
had
the
gratification
of
passing
his
uncle
through
varied
contortions
and
at
last
hippias
perspired
in
conviction
and
exclaimed
this
accounts
for
his
conduct
to
me
that
boy
must
have
a
cunning
nothing
short
of
infernal
i
feel
i
feel
it
just
here
he
drew
a
hand
along
his
midriff
i
not
equal
to
this
world
of
fools
he
added
faintly
and
shut
his
eyes
no
i
ca
dine
eat
ha
no
go
without
me
shortly
after
hippias
went
to
bed
saying
to
himself
as
he
undressed
see
what
comes
of
our
fine
schemes
poor
austin
and
as
the
pillow
swelled
over
his
ears
i
not
sure
that
a
day
fast
wo
do
me
good
the
dyspepsy
had
bought
his
philosophy
at
a
heavy
price
he
had
a
right
to
use
it
adrian
resumed
the
procession
of
the
cake
he
sighted
his
melancholy
uncle
algernon
hunting
an
appetite
in
the
row
and
looking
as
if
the
hope
ahead
of
him
were
also
the
captain
did
not
pass
with
out
querying
the
ungainly
parcel
i
hope
i
carry
it
ostentatiously
enough
said
adrian
enclosed
is
wherewithal
to
quiet
the
alarm
of
the
land
now
may
the
maids
and
wives
of
merry
england
sleep
secure
i
had
half
a
mind
to
fix
it
on
a
pole
and
engage
a
band
to
parade
it
this
is
our
dear
married
at
eleven
this
morning
by
licence
at
the
kensington
parish
church
his
own
ring
being
lost
he
employed
the
ring
of
his
beautiful
bride
lachrymose
she
standing
adjacent
by
the
altar
his
farewell
to
you
as
a
bachelor
and
hers
as
a
maid
you
can
claim
on
the
spot
if
you
think
proper
and
digest
according
to
your
powers

the
other

about

me
to
her

little
baggage

introducing
her
as
daughter
and
himself
as
beelzebub
son
however
the
wild
animal
is
in
hymen
chains
and
the
cake
is
cut
will
you
have
your
morsel
oh
by
all
means
not
now
algernon
had
an
unwonted
air
of
father
know
it
not
yet
he
will
by
nine
then
i
must
see
him
by
seven
do
say
you
met
me
he
nodded
and
pricked
his
horse
wants
money
said
adrian
putting
the
combustible
he
carried
once
more
in
motion
the
women
were
the
crowning
joy
of
his
contemplative
mind
he
had
reserved
them
for
his
final
discharge
dear
demonstrative
creatures
dyspepsia
would
not
weaken
their
poignant
outcries
or
check
their
fainting
fits
on
the
generic
woman
one
could
calculate
well
might
the
pilgrim
scrip
say
of
her
that
she
is
always
at
nature
breast
not
intending
it
as
a
compliment
each
woman
is
eve
throughout
the
ages
whereas
the
pilgrim
would
have
us
believe
that
the
adam
in
men
has
become
warier
if
not
wiser
and
weak
as
he
is
has
learnt
a
lesson
from
time
probably
the
pilgrim
meaning
may
be
taken
to
be
that
man
grows
and
woman
does
not
at
any
rate
adrian
hoped
for
such
natural
choruses
as
you
hear
in
the
nursery
when
a
bauble
is
lost
he
was
awake
to
doria
maternal
predestinations
and
guessed
that
clare
stood
ready
with
the
best
form
of
filial
obedience
they
were
only
a
poor
couple
to
gratify
his
mephistophelian
humour
to
be
sure
but
doria
was
equal
to
twenty
and
they
would
proclaim
the
diverse
ways
with
which
maidenhood
and
womanhood
took
disappointment
while
the
surrounding
forey
girls
and
other
females
of
the
family
assembly
were
expected
to
develop
the
finer
shades
and
tapering
edges
of
an
agitation
to
which
no
woman
could
be
cold
all
went
well
he
managed
cleverly
to
leave
the
cake
unchallenged
in
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
and
stepped
gaily
down
to
dinner
much
of
the
conversation
adverted
to
richard
doria
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
the
youth
or
heard
of
him
seen
him
no
heard
of
him
yes
said
adrian
i
have
heard
of
him
i
heard
that
he
was
sublimely
happy
and
had
eaten
such
a
breakfast
that
dinner
was
impossible
claret
and
cold
chicken
cake
and
cake
at
breakfast
they
all
that
seems
to
be
his
fancy
just
now
what
an
extraordinary
taste
you
know
he
is
educated
on
a
system
one
fast
young
male
forey
allied
the
system
and
the
cake
in
a
miserable
pun
adrian
a
hater
of
puns
looked
at
him
and
held
the
table
silent
as
if
he
were
going
to
speak
but
he
said
nothing
and
the
young
gentleman
vanished
from
the
conversation
in
a
blush
extinguished
by
his
own
spark
doria
peevishly
exclaimed
oh
i
suppose
i
wish
he
understood
a
little
better
the
obligations
of
relationship
whether
he
understands
them
i
ca
say
observed
adrian
but
i
assure
you
he
is
very
energetic
in
extending
them
the
wise
youth
talked
innuendoes
whenever
he
had
an
opportunity
that
his
dear
relative
might
be
rendered
sufficiently
inflammable
by
and
by
at
the
aspect
of
the
cake
but
he
was
not
thought
more
than
commonly
mysterious
and
deep
was
his
appointment
at
the
house
of
those
grandison
people
doria
asked
with
a
hostile
adrian
warmed
the
blindfolded
parties
by
replying
do
they
keep
a
beadle
at
the
door
doria
animosity
to
grandison
made
her
treat
this
as
a
piece
of
satirical
ingenuousness
i
daresay
they
do
she
said
and
a
curate
on
hand
oh
i
should
think
a
dozen
old
forey
advised
his
punning
grandson
clarence
to
give
that
house
a
wide
berth
where
he
might
be
disposed
of
and
at
a
notice
and
the
scent
ran
off
at
a
jest
the
foreys
gave
good
dinners
and
with
the
old
gentleman
the
excellent
old
fashion
remained
in
permanence
of
trooping
off
the
ladies
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
their
sustenance
and
just
exchanged
a
smile
with
the
flowers
and
the
dessert
when
they
rose
to
fade
with
a
beautiful
accord
and
the
gallant
males
breathed
under
easier
waistcoats
and
settled
to
the
business
of
the
table
sure
that
an
hour
for
unbosoming
and
imbibing
was
their
own
adrian
took
a
chair
by
brandon
forey
a
barrister
of
standing
i
want
to
ask
you
he
said
whether
an
infant
in
law
can
legally
bind
himself
if
he
old
enough
to
affix
his
signature
to
an
instrument
i
suppose
he
can
yawned
brandon
is
he
responsible
for
his
acts
i
no
doubt
we
could
hang
him
then
what
he
could
do
for
himself
you
could
do
for
him
not
quite
so
much
pretty
near
for
instance
he
can
marry
that
not
a
criminal
case
you
know
and
the
marriage
is
valid
you
can
dispute
it
yes
and
the
greeks
and
the
trojans
can
fight
it
holds
then
both
water
and
fire
the
patriarch
of
the
table
sang
out
to
adrian
that
he
stopped
the
vigorous
circulation
of
the
claret
dear
me
sir
said
adrian
i
beg
pardon
the
circumstances
must
excuse
me
the
fact
is
my
cousin
richard
got
married
to
a
dairymaid
this
morning
and
i
wanted
to
know
whether
it
held
in
law
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
manly
coolness
with
which
the
announcement
was
taken
nothing
was
heard
more
energetic
than
deuce
he
has
and
a
dairymaid
i
thought
it
better
to
let
the
ladies
dine
in
peace
adrian
continued
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
console
my
aunt
well
but
well
but
the
old
gentleman
much
the
most
excited
eh
brandon
he
a
boy
this
young
ass
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
a
boy
can
go
and
marry
when
he
pleases
and
any
troll
he
pleases
and
the
marriage
is
good
if
i
thought
that
i
turn
every
woman
off
my
premises
i
would
from
the
housekeeper
to
the
i
have
no
woman
near
him
till
till
till
the
young
greenhorn
was
grey
sir
suggested
brandon
till
he
knew
what
women
are
made
of
sir
the
old
gentleman
finished
his
sentence
vehemently
what
d
think
will
feverel
say
to
it
mr
adrian
he
has
been
trying
the
very
system
you
have
proposed
sir
one
that
does
not
reckon
on
the
powerful
action
of
curiosity
on
the
juvenile
intelligence
i
afraid
it
the
very
worst
way
of
solving
the
problem
of
course
it
is
said
clarence
none
but
a
fool
at
your
age
adrian
relieved
his
embarrassment
it
is
natural
my
dear
clarence
that
you
should
consider
the
idea
of
an
isolated
or
imprisoned
manhood
something
monstrous
and
we
do
not
expect
you
to
see
what
amount
of
wisdom
it
contains
you
follow
one
extreme
and
we
the
other
i
do
say
that
a
middle
course
exists
the
history
of
mankind
shows
our
painful
efforts
to
find
one
but
they
have
invariably
resolved
themselves
into
asceticism
or
laxity
acting
and
reacting
the
moral
question
is
if
a
naughty
little
man
by
reason
of
his
naughtiness
releases
himself
from
foolishness
does
a
foolish
little
man
by
reason
of
his
foolishness
save
himself
from
naughtiness
a
discussion
peculiar
to
men
of
the
world
succeeded
the
laugh
at
clarence
then
coffee
was
handed
round
and
the
footman
informed
adrian
in
a
low
voice
that
doria
forey
particularly
wished
to
speak
with
him
adrian
preferred
not
to
go
in
alone
very
well
he
said
and
sipped
his
coffee
they
talked
on
sounding
the
depths
of
law
in
brandon
forey
and
receiving
nought
but
hollow
echoes
from
that
profound
cavity
he
would
not
affirm
that
the
marriage
was
invalid
he
would
not
affirm
that
it
could
not
be
annulled
he
thought
not
still
he
thought
it
would
be
worth
trying
a
consummated
and
a
union
were
two
different
things
dear
me
said
adrian
does
the
law
recognize
that
why
that
almost
human
another
message
was
brought
to
adrian
that
doria
forey
very
particularly
wished
to
speak
with
him
what
can
be
the
matter
he
exclaimed
pleased
to
have
his
faith
in
woman
strengthened
the
cake
had
exploded
no
doubt
so
it
proved
when
the
gentlemen
joined
the
fair
society
all
the
younger
ladies
stood
about
the
table
whereon
the
cake
stood
displayed
gaps
being
left
for
those
sitting
to
feast
their
vision
and
intrude
the
comments
and
speculations
continually
arising
from
fresh
shocks
of
wonder
at
the
unaccountable
apparition
entering
with
the
air
of
men
who
know
they
have
come
from
a
grosser
atmosphere
the
gallant
males
also
ranged
themselves
round
the
common
object
of
curiosity
here
adrian
doria
cried
where
is
adrian
pray
come
here
tell
me
where
did
this
cake
come
from
whose
is
it
what
does
it
do
here
you
know
all
about
it
for
you
brought
it
clare
saw
you
bring
it
into
the
room
what
does
it
mean
i
insist
upon
a
direct
answer
now
do
not
make
me
impatient
adrian
certainly
doria
was
equal
to
twenty
by
her
concentrated
rapidity
and
volcanic
complexion
it
was
evident
that
suspicion
had
kindled
i
was
really
bound
to
bring
it
adrian
protested
answer
me
the
wise
youth
bowed
categorically
this
cake
came
from
the
house
of
a
person
a
female
of
the
name
of
berry
it
belongs
to
you
partly
partly
to
me
partly
to
clare
and
to
the
rest
of
our
family
on
the
principle
of
equal
division
for
which
purpose
it
is
present
yes
speak
it
means
my
dear
aunt
what
that
kind
of
cake
usually
does
mean
this
then
is
the
breakfast
and
the
ring
adrian
where
is
richard
doria
still
clung
to
unbelief
in
the
monstrous
horror
but
when
adrian
told
her
that
richard
had
left
town
her
struggling
hope
sank
the
wretched
boy
has
ruined
himself
she
said
and
sat
down
trembling
oh
that
system
the
delicate
vituperations
gentle
ladies
use
instead
of
oaths
doria
showered
on
that
system
she
hesitated
not
to
say
that
her
brother
had
got
what
he
deserved
opinionated
morbid
weak
justice
had
overtaken
him
now
he
would
see
but
at
what
a
price
at
what
a
sacrifice
doria
commanded
adrian
to
confirm
her
fears
sadly
the
wise
youth
recapitulated
berry
words
he
was
married
this
morning
at
eleven
of
the
clock
or
twenty
to
twelve
by
licence
at
the
kensington
parish
church
then
that
was
his
appointment
doria
murmured
that
was
the
cake
for
breakfast
breathed
a
second
of
her
sex
and
it
was
his
ring
exclaimed
a
third
the
men
were
silent
and
made
long
faces
clare
stood
cold
and
sedate
she
and
her
mother
avoided
each
eyes
is
it
that
abominable
country
person
adrian
the
happy
damsel
is
i
regret
to
say
the
papist
dairymaid
said
adrian
in
sorrowful
but
deliberate
accents
then
arose
a
feminine
hum
in
the
midst
of
which
doria
cried
brandon
she
was
a
woman
of
energy
her
thoughts
resolved
to
action
spontaneously
brandon
she
drew
the
barrister
a
little
aside
can
they
not
be
followed
and
separated
i
want
your
advice
can
not
we
separate
them
a
boy
it
is
really
shameful
if
he
should
be
allowed
to
fall
into
the
toils
of
a
designing
creature
to
ruin
himself
irrevocably
can
we
not
brandon
the
worthy
barrister
felt
inclined
to
laugh
but
he
answered
her
entreaties
from
what
i
hear
of
the
young
groom
i
should
imagine
the
office
perilous
i
speaking
of
law
brandon
can
we
not
obtain
an
order
from
one
of
your
courts
to
pursue
them
and
separate
them
instantly
this
evening
yes
brandon
was
sorry
to
say
she
decidedly
could
not
you
might
call
on
one
of
your
judges
brandon
brandon
assured
her
that
the
judges
were
a
race
and
to
a
man
slept
heavily
after
dinner
will
you
do
so
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
will
you
promise
me
to
do
so
brandon
or
a
magistrate
a
magistrate
would
send
a
policeman
after
them
my
dear
brandon
i
beg
i
beg
you
to
assist
us
in
this
dreadful
extremity
it
will
be
the
death
of
my
poor
brother
i
believe
he
would
forgive
anything
but
this
you
have
no
idea
what
his
notions
are
of
blood
brandon
tipped
adrian
a
significant
nod
to
step
in
and
aid
what
is
it
aunt
asked
the
wise
youth
you
want
them
followed
and
torn
asunder
by
wild
policemen
brandon
queerly
interposed
wo
that
be
just
too
late
adrian
suggested
doria
sighed
out
her
last
spark
of
hope
you
see
said
adrian
yes
yes
doria
did
not
require
any
of
his
elucidations
pray
be
quiet
adrian
and
let
me
speak
brandon
it
can
not
be
it
quite
impossible
can
you
stand
there
and
tell
me
that
boy
is
legally
married
i
never
will
believe
it
the
law
can
not
be
so
shamefully
bad
as
to
permit
a
boy
a
mere
child
to
do
such
absurd
things
grandpapa
she
beckoned
to
the
old
gentleman
grandpapa
pray
do
make
brandon
speak
these
lawyers
never
will
he
might
stop
it
if
he
would
if
i
were
a
man
do
you
think
i
would
stand
here
well
my
dear
the
old
gentleman
toddled
to
compose
her
i
quite
of
your
opinion
i
believe
he
knows
no
more
than
you
or
i
my
belief
is
they
none
of
them
know
anything
till
they
join
issue
and
go
into
court
i
want
to
see
a
few
female
lawyers
to
encourage
the
bankrupt
perruquier
sir
said
adrian
they
would
have
to
keep
a
large
supply
of
wigs
on
hand
and
you
can
jest
adrian
his
aunt
reproached
him
but
i
will
not
be
beaten
i
know
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
no
law
would
ever
allow
a
boy
to
disgrace
his
family
and
ruin
himself
like
that
and
nothing
shall
persuade
me
that
it
is
so
now
tell
me
brandon
and
pray
do
speak
in
answer
to
my
questions
and
please
to
forget
you
are
dealing
with
a
woman
can
my
nephew
be
rescued
from
the
consequences
of
his
folly
is
what
he
has
done
legitimate
is
he
bound
for
life
by
what
he
has
done
while
a
boy
well
a
brandon
breathed
through
his
teeth
a
hm
the
matter
so
very
delicate
you
see
helen
you
to
forget
that
adrian
remarked
a
hm
well
pursued
brandon
perhaps
if
you
could
arrest
and
divide
them
before
nightfall
and
make
affidavit
of
certain
facts
yes
the
eager
woman
hastened
his
lagging
mouth
well
hm
a
in
that
case
a
or
if
a
lunatic
you
could
prove
him
to
have
been
of
unsound
oh
there
no
doubt
of
his
madness
on
my
mind
brandon
yes
well
in
that
case
or
if
of
different
religious
persuasions
she
is
a
catholic
doria
joyfully
interjected
yes
well
in
that
case
objections
might
be
taken
to
the
form
of
the
marriage
might
be
proved
fictitious
or
if
he
under
say
eighteen
years
he
ca
be
much
more
cried
doria
i
think
she
appeared
to
reflect
and
then
faltered
imploringly
to
adrian
what
is
age
the
kind
wise
youth
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
strike
away
the
phantom
straw
she
caught
at
oh
about
that
i
should
fancy
he
muttered
and
found
it
necessary
at
the
same
time
to
duck
and
turn
his
head
for
concealment
doria
surpassed
his
expectations
yes
i
well
then
brandon
was
resuming
with
a
shrug
which
was
meant
to
say
he
still
pledged
himself
to
nothing
when
clare
voice
was
heard
from
out
the
buzzing
circle
of
her
cousins
richard
is
nineteen
years
and
six
months
old
mama
nonsense
child
he
is
mama
clare
voice
was
very
steadfast
nonsense
i
tell
you
how
can
you
know
richard
is
one
year
and
nine
months
older
than
me
mama
doria
fought
the
fact
by
years
and
finally
by
months
clare
was
too
strong
for
her
singular
child
she
mentally
apostrophized
the
girl
who
scornfully
rejected
straws
while
drowning
but
there
the
religion
still
she
comforted
herself
and
sat
down
to
cogitate
the
men
smiled
and
looked
vacuous
music
was
proposed
there
are
times
when
soft
music
hath
not
charms
when
it
is
put
to
as
base
uses
as
imperial
caesar
dust
and
is
taken
to
fill
horrid
pauses
angelica
forey
thumped
the
piano
and
sang
i
a
laughing
gitana
matilda
forey
and
her
cousin
mary
branksburne
wedded
their
voices
and
songfully
incited
all
young
people
to
haste
to
the
bower
that
love
has
built
and
defy
the
wise
ones
of
the
world
but
the
wise
ones
of
the
world
were
in
a
majority
there
and
very
few
places
of
assembly
will
be
found
where
they
are
not
so
the
glowing
appeal
of
the
british
passed
into
the
bosom
of
the
emptiness
he
addressed
clare
was
asked
to
entertain
the
company
the
singular
child
calmly
marched
to
the
instrument
and
turned
over
the
appropriate
illustrations
to
the
repertory
clare
sang
a
little
irish
air
her
duty
done
she
marched
from
the
piano
mothers
are
rarely
deceived
by
their
daughters
in
these
matters
but
clare
deceived
her
mother
and
doria
only
persisted
in
feeling
an
agony
of
pity
for
her
child
that
she
might
the
more
warrantably
pity
herself
a
not
uncommon
form
of
the
emotion
for
there
is
no
juggler
like
that
heart
the
puts
into
our
mouths
so
boldly
remember
that
she
saw
years
of
years
of
a
ripening
scheme
rendered
fruitless
in
a
minute
and
by
the
system
which
had
almost
reduced
her
to
the
condition
of
constitutional
hypocrite
she
had
enough
of
bitterness
to
brood
over
and
some
excuse
for
still
even
when
she
was
cooler
doria
energetic
nature
prevented
her
from
giving
up
straws
were
straws
and
the
frailer
they
were
the
harder
she
clutched
them
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
left
the
room
calling
to
adrian
to
follow
her
adrian
she
said
turning
upon
him
in
the
passage
you
mentioned
a
house
where
this
horrible
cake
where
he
was
this
morning
i
desire
you
to
take
me
to
that
woman
immediately
the
wise
youth
had
not
bargained
for
personal
servitude
he
had
hoped
he
should
be
in
time
for
the
last
act
of
the
opera
that
night
after
enjoying
the
comedy
of
real
life
my
dear
aunt
he
was
beginning
to
insinuate
order
a
cab
to
be
sent
for
and
get
your
hat
said
doria
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
he
stamped
his
assent
to
the
pilgrim
dictum
that
women
are
practical
creatures
and
now
reflected
on
his
own
account
that
relationship
to
a
young
fool
may
be
a
vexation
and
a
nuisance
however
doria
compensated
him
what
doria
intended
to
do
the
practical
creature
did
not
plainly
know
but
her
energy
positively
demanded
to
be
used
in
some
way
or
other
and
her
instinct
directed
her
to
the
offender
on
whom
she
could
use
it
in
wrath
she
wanted
somebody
to
be
angry
with
somebody
to
abuse
she
dared
not
abuse
her
brother
to
his
face
him
she
would
have
to
console
adrian
was
a
to
the
system
and
would
she
was
aware
bring
her
into
painfully
delicate
albeit
highly
philosophic
ground
by
a
discussion
of
the
case
so
she
drove
to
bessy
berry
simply
to
inquire
whither
her
nephew
had
flown
when
a
soft
woman
and
that
soft
woman
a
sinner
is
matched
with
a
woman
of
energy
she
does
not
show
much
fight
and
she
meets
no
mercy
bessy
berry
creditor
came
to
her
in
female
form
that
night
she
then
beheld
it
in
all
its
terrors
hitherto
it
had
appeared
to
her
as
a
male
a
disembodied
spirit
of
her
imagination
possessing
male
attributes
and
the
peculiar
male
characteristic
of
being
moved
and
ultimately
silenced
by
tears
as
female
her
creditor
was
terrible
indeed
still
had
it
not
been
a
late
hour
bessy
berry
would
have
died
rather
than
speak
openly
that
her
babes
had
sped
to
make
their
nest
in
the
isle
of
wight
they
had
a
long
start
they
were
out
of
the
reach
of
pursuers
they
were
safe
and
she
told
what
she
had
to
tell
she
told
more
than
was
wise
of
her
to
tell
she
made
mention
of
her
early
service
in
the
family
and
of
her
little
pension
alas
her
little
pension
her
creditor
had
come
expecting
no
payment
come
as
creditors
are
wont
in
such
moods
just
to
take
it
out
of
her
to
employ
the
familiar
term
at
once
doria
pounced
upon
the
pension
that
of
course
you
know
is
at
an
end
she
said
in
the
calmest
manner
and
berry
did
not
plead
for
the
little
bit
of
bread
to
her
she
only
asked
a
little
consideration
for
her
feelings
true
admirers
of
women
had
better
stand
aside
from
the
scene
undoubtedly
it
was
very
sad
for
adrian
to
be
compelled
to
witness
it
doria
was
not
generous
the
pilgrim
may
be
wrong
about
the
sex
not
growing
but
its
fashion
of
conducting
warfare
we
must
allow
to
be
barbarous
and
according
to
what
is
deemed
the
pristine
or
wild
cat
method
ruin
nothing
short
of
it
accompanied
poor
berry
to
her
bed
that
night
and
her
character
bled
till
morning
on
her
pillow
the
scene
over
adrian
reconducted
doria
to
her
home
mice
had
been
at
the
cake
during
her
absence
apparently
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
put
it
on
the
greedy
mice
who
were
accused
of
having
gorged
and
gone
to
bed
i
sure
they
quite
welcome
said
doria
it
a
farce
this
marriage
and
adrian
has
quite
come
to
my
way
of
thinking
i
would
not
touch
an
atom
of
it
why
they
were
married
in
a
married
woman
ring
can
that
be
legal
as
you
call
it
oh
i
convinced
do
tell
me
austin
will
be
in
town
and
if
he
is
true
to
his
principles
he
will
instantly
adopt
measures
to
rescue
his
son
from
infamy
i
want
no
legal
advice
i
go
upon
common
sense
common
decency
this
marriage
is
false
doria
fine
scheme
had
become
so
much
a
part
of
her
life
that
she
could
not
give
it
up
she
took
clare
to
her
bed
and
caressed
and
wept
over
her
as
she
would
not
have
done
had
she
known
the
singular
child
saying
poor
richard
my
dear
poor
boy
we
must
save
him
clare
we
must
save
him
of
the
two
the
mother
showed
the
greater
want
of
iron
on
this
occasion
clare
lay
in
her
arms
rigid
and
emotionless
with
one
of
her
hands
all
she
said
was
i
knew
it
in
the
morning
mama
she
slept
clasping
richard
nuptial
ring
by
this
time
all
specially
concerned
in
the
system
knew
it
the
honeymoon
was
shoring
placidly
above
them
is
not
happiness
like
another
circulating
medium
when
we
have
a
very
great
deal
of
it
some
poor
hearts
are
aching
for
what
is
taken
away
from
them
when
we
have
gone
out
and
seized
it
on
the
highways
certain
inscrutable
laws
are
sure
to
be
at
work
to
bring
us
to
the
criminal
bar
sooner
or
later
who
knows
the
honeymoon
that
did
not
steal
somebody
sweetness
richard
turpin
went
forth
singing
money
or
life
to
the
world
richard
feverel
has
done
the
same
substituting
happiness
for
money
frequently
synonyms
the
coin
he
wanted
he
would
have
and
was
just
as
much
a
highway
robber
as
his
fellow
dick
so
that
those
who
have
failed
to
recognize
him
as
a
hero
before
may
now
regard
him
in
that
light
meanwhile
the
world
he
has
squeezed
looks
exceedingly
patient
and
beautiful
his
coin
chinks
delicious
music
to
him
nature
and
the
order
of
things
on
earth
have
no
warmer
admirer
than
a
jolly
brigand
or
a
young
man
made
happy
by
the
jews
chapter
xxxiii
and
now
the
author
of
the
system
was
on
trial
under
the
eyes
of
the
lady
who
loved
him
what
so
kind
as
they
yet
are
they
very
rigorous
those
soft
watchful
woman
eyes
if
you
are
below
the
measure
they
have
made
of
you
you
will
feel
it
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
can
not
but
show
you
that
she
took
you
for
a
giant
and
has
had
to
come
down
a
bit
you
feel
yourself
strangely
diminishing
in
those
sweet
mirrors
till
at
last
they
drop
on
you
complacently
level
but
oh
beware
vain
man
of
ever
waxing
enamoured
of
that
wonderful
elongation
of
a
male
creature
you
saw
reflected
in
her
adoring
upcast
orbs
beware
of
assisting
to
delude
her
a
woman
who
is
not
quite
a
fool
will
forgive
your
being
but
a
man
if
you
are
surely
that
she
will
haply
learn
to
acknowledge
that
no
mortal
tailor
could
have
fitted
that
figure
she
made
of
you
respectably
and
that
practically
though
she
sighs
to
think
it
her
ideal
of
you
was
on
the
pattern
of
an
overgrown
in
the
regulation
jacket
and
breech
for
this
she
first
scorns
the
narrow
capacities
of
the
tailor
and
then
smiles
at
herself
but
shouldst
thou
when
the
hour
says
plainly
be
thyself
and
the
woman
is
willing
to
take
thee
as
thou
art
shouldst
thou
still
aspire
to
be
that
thing
of
shanks
and
wrests
wilt
thou
not
seem
contemptible
as
well
as
ridiculous
and
when
the
fall
comes
will
it
not
be
flat
on
thy
face
instead
of
to
the
common
height
of
men
you
may
fall
miles
below
her
measure
of
you
and
be
safe
nothing
is
damaged
save
an
overgrown
but
if
you
fall
below
the
common
height
of
men
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
see
her
rustle
her
gown
spy
at
the
and
transfer
her
allegiance
the
moral
of
which
is
that
if
we
pretend
to
be
what
we
are
not
woman
for
whose
amusement
the
farce
is
performed
will
find
us
out
and
punish
us
for
it
and
it
is
usually
the
end
of
a
sentimental
dalliance
had
sir
austin
given
vent
to
the
pain
and
wrath
it
was
natural
he
should
feel
he
might
have
gone
to
unphilosophic
excesses
and
however
much
he
lowered
his
reputation
as
a
sage
lady
blandish
would
have
excused
him
she
would
not
have
loved
him
less
for
seeing
him
closer
but
the
poor
gentleman
tasked
his
soul
and
stretched
his
muscles
to
act
up
to
her
conception
of
him
he
a
man
of
science
in
life
who
was
bound
to
be
surprised
by
nothing
in
nature
it
was
not
for
him
to
do
more
than
lift
his
eyebrows
and
draw
in
his
lips
at
the
news
delivered
by
ripton
thompson
that
ill
bird
at
raynham
all
he
said
after
ripton
had
handed
the
letters
and
carried
his
penitential
headache
to
bed
was
you
see
emmeline
it
is
useless
to
base
any
system
on
a
human
being
a
very
philosophical
remark
for
one
who
has
been
busily
at
work
building
for
nearly
twenty
years
too
philosophical
to
seem
genuine
it
revealed
where
the
blow
struck
sharpest
richard
was
no
longer
the
richard
of
his
creation
his
pride
and
his
joy
but
simply
a
human
being
with
the
rest
the
bright
star
had
sunk
among
the
mass
and
yet
what
had
the
young
man
done
and
in
what
had
the
system
failed
the
lady
could
not
but
ask
herself
this
while
she
condoled
with
the
offended
father
my
friend
she
said
tenderly
taking
his
hand
before
she
retired
i
know
how
deeply
you
must
be
grieved
i
know
what
your
disappointment
must
be
i
do
not
beg
of
you
to
forgive
him
now
you
can
not
doubt
his
love
for
this
young
person
and
according
to
his
light
has
he
not
behaved
honourably
and
as
you
would
have
wished
rather
than
bring
her
to
shame
you
will
think
of
that
it
has
been
an
accident
a
misfortune
a
terrible
misfortune
the
god
of
this
world
is
in
the
machine
not
out
of
it
sir
austin
interrupted
her
and
pressed
her
hand
to
get
the
over
at
any
other
time
her
mind
would
have
been
arrested
to
admire
the
phrase
now
it
seemed
perverse
vain
false
and
she
was
tempted
to
turn
the
meaning
that
was
in
it
against
himself
much
as
she
pitied
him
you
know
emmeline
he
added
i
believe
very
little
in
the
fortune
or
misfortune
to
which
men
attribute
their
successes
and
reverses
they
are
useful
impersonations
to
novelists
but
my
opinion
is
sufficiently
high
of
flesh
and
blood
to
believe
that
we
make
our
own
history
without
intervention
accidents
terrible
misfortunes
what
are
they
night
she
said
looking
sad
and
troubled
when
i
said
i
meant
of
course
that
he
is
to
blame
but
shall
i
leave
you
his
letter
to
me
i
think
i
have
enough
to
meditate
upon
he
replied
coldly
bowing
god
bless
you
she
whispered
and
may
i
say
it
do
not
shut
your
heart
he
assured
her
that
he
hoped
not
to
do
so
and
the
moment
she
was
gone
he
set
about
shutting
it
as
tight
as
he
could
if
instead
of
saying
base
no
system
on
a
human
being
he
had
said
never
experimentalize
with
one
he
would
have
been
nearer
the
truth
of
his
own
case
he
had
experimented
on
humanity
in
the
person
of
the
son
he
loved
as
his
life
and
at
once
when
the
experiment
appeared
to
have
failed
all
humanity
failings
fell
on
the
shoulders
of
his
son
richard
parting
laugh
in
the
train
it
was
explicable
now
it
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
mockery
of
this
base
nature
of
ours
at
every
endeavour
to
exalt
and
chasten
it
the
young
man
had
plotted
this
from
step
to
step
sir
austin
traced
the
plot
the
curious
mask
he
had
worn
since
his
illness
the
selection
of
his
incapable
uncle
hippias
for
a
companion
in
preference
to
adrian
it
was
an
evident
plot
that
hideous
laugh
would
not
be
silenced
base
like
the
rest
treacherous
a
creature
of
passions
using
his
abilities
solely
to
gratify
them
never
surely
had
humanity
such
chances
as
in
him
a
manichaean
tendency
from
which
the
sententious
eulogist
of
nature
had
been
struggling
for
years
and
which
was
partly
at
the
bottom
of
the
system
now
began
to
cloud
and
usurp
dominion
of
his
mind
as
he
sat
alone
in
the
forlorn
of
his
library
he
saw
the
devil
how
are
we
to
know
when
we
are
at
the
head
and
fountain
of
the
fates
of
them
we
love
there
by
the
springs
of
richard
future
his
father
sat
and
the
devil
said
to
him
only
be
quiet
do
nothing
resolutely
do
nothing
your
object
now
is
to
keep
a
brave
face
to
the
world
so
that
all
may
know
you
superior
to
this
human
nature
that
has
deceived
you
for
it
is
the
shameless
deception
not
the
marriage
that
has
wounded
you
ay
answered
the
baronet
the
shameless
deception
not
the
marriage
wicked
and
ruinous
as
it
must
be
a
destroyer
of
my
tenderest
hopes
my
dearest
schemes
not
the
marriage
the
shameless
deception
and
he
crumpled
up
his
son
letter
to
him
and
tossed
it
into
the
fire
how
are
we
to
distinguish
the
dark
chief
of
the
manichaeans
when
he
talks
our
own
thoughts
to
us
further
he
whispered
and
your
system
if
you
would
be
brave
to
the
world
have
courage
to
cast
the
dream
of
it
out
of
you
relinquish
an
impossible
project
see
it
as
it
is
dead
too
good
for
men
ay
muttered
the
baronet
all
who
would
save
them
perish
on
the
cross
and
so
he
sat
nursing
the
devil
by
and
by
he
took
his
lamp
and
put
on
the
old
cloak
and
cap
and
went
to
gaze
at
ripton
that
exhausted
debauchee
and
youth
without
a
destiny
slept
a
dead
sleep
a
handkerchief
was
bound
about
his
forehead
and
his
helpless
sunken
chin
and
snoring
nose
projected
up
the
pillow
made
him
look
absurdly
piteous
the
baronet
remembered
how
often
he
had
compared
his
boy
with
this
one
his
own
bright
boy
and
where
was
the
difference
between
them
mere
outward
gilding
said
his
familiar
yes
he
responded
i
daresay
this
one
never
positively
plotted
to
deceive

followed
his

unchecked
and

the

the
evil
in
us
demand
its
natural
food
or
it
corrupts
the
whole
ejaculated
sir
austin
and
is
no
angel
of
avail
till
that
is
drawn
off
and
is
that
our
conflict
to
see
whether
we
can
escape
the
contagion
of
its
embrace
and
come
uncorrupted
out
of
that
the
world
is

look
on

through

suggested

his
lawyer
thompson

noble

whither
and
ends
where
richard
laugh
taken
up
by
horrid
reverberations
as
it
were
through
the
lengths
of
the
lower
halls
replied
this
colloquy
of
two
voices
in
a
brain
was
concluded
by
sir
austin
asking
again
if
there
were
no
actual
difference
between
the
flower
of
his
hopes
and
yonder
drunken
weed
and
receiving
for
answer
that
there
was
a
decided
dissimilarity
in
the
smell
of
the
couple
becoming
cognizant
of
which
he
retreated
sir
austin
did
not
battle
with
the
tempter
he
took
him
into
his
bosom
at
once
as
if
he
had
been
ripe
for
him
and
received
his
suggestions
and
bowed
to
his
dictates
because
he
suffered
and
decreed
that
he
would
suffer
silently
and
be
the
only
sufferer
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
his
calamity
he
had
stood
against
the
world
the
world
had
beaten
him
what
then
he
must
shut
his
heart
and
mask
his
face
that
was
all
to
be
far
in
advance
of
the
mass
is
as
fruitless
to
mankind
he
reflected
as
straggling
in
the
rear
for
how
do
we
know
that
they
move
behind
us
at
all
or
move
in
our
track
what
we
win
for
them
is
lost
and
where
we
are
overthrown
we
lie
it
was
thus
that
a
fine
mind
and
a
fine
heart
at
the
bounds
of
a
nature
not
great
chose
to
colour
his
retrogression
and
countenance
his
shortcoming
and
it
was
thus
that
he
set
about
ruining
the
work
he
had
done
he
might
well
say
as
he
once
did
that
there
are
hours
when
the
clearest
soul
becomes
a
cunning
fox
for
a
grief
that
was
private
and
peculiar
he
unhesitatingly
cast
the
blame
upon
humanity
just
as
he
had
accused
it
in
the
period
of
what
he
termed
his
own
ordeal
how
had
he
borne
that
by
masking
his
face
and
he
prepared
the
ordeal
for
his
son
by
doing
the
same
this
was
by
no
means
his
idea
of
a
man
duty
in
tribulation
about
which
he
could
be
strenuously
eloquent
but
it
was
his
instinct
so
to
act
and
in
times
of
trial
great
natures
alone
are
not
at
the
mercy
of
their
instincts
moreover
it
would
cost
him
pain
to
mask
his
face
pain
worse
than
that
he
endured
when
there
still
remained
an
object
for
him
to
open
his
heart
to
in
proportion
and
he
always
reposed
upon
the
spartan
comfort
of
bearing
pain
and
being
passive
do
nothing
said
the
devil
he
nursed
which
meant
in
his
case
take
me
into
you
and
do
cast
me
out
excellent
and
sane
is
the
outburst
of
wrath
to
men
when
it
stops
short
of
slaughter
for
who
that
locks
it
up
to
eat
in
solitary
can
say
that
it
is
consumed
sir
austin
had
as
weak
a
digestion
for
wrath
as
poor
hippias
for
a
green
duckling
instead
of
eating
it
it
ate
him
the
wild
beast
in
him
was
not
the
less
deadly
because
it
did
not
roar
and
the
devil
in
him
not
the
less
active
because
he
resolved
to
do
nothing
he
sat
at
the
springs
of
richard
future
in
the
forlorn
of
his
library
there
hearing
the
cinders
click
in
the
extinguished
fire
and
that
humming
stillness
in
which
one
may
fancy
one
hears
the
midnight
fates
busily
stirring
their
embryos
the
lamp
glowed
mildly
on
the
bust
of
chatham
toward
morning
a
gentle
knock
fell
at
his
door
lady
blandish
glided
in
with
hasty
step
she
came
straight
to
him
and
took
both
his
hands
my
friend
she
said
speaking
tearfully
and
trembling
i
feared
i
should
find
you
here
i
could
not
sleep
how
is
it
with
you
well
emmeline
well
he
replied
torturing
his
brows
to
fix
the
mask
he
wished
it
had
been
adrian
who
had
come
to
him
he
had
an
extraordinary
longing
for
adrian
society
he
knew
that
the
wise
youth
would
divine
how
to
treat
him
and
he
mentally
confessed
to
just
enough
weakness
to
demand
a
certain
kind
of
management
besides
adrian
he
had
not
a
doubt
would
accept
him
entirely
as
he
seemed
and
not
pester
him
in
any
way
by
trying
to
unlock
his
heart
whereas
a
woman
he
feared
would
be
waxing
too
womanly
and
swelling
from
tears
and
supplications
to
a
scene
of
all
things
abhorred
by
him
the
most
so
he
rapped
the
floor
with
his
foot
and
gave
the
lady
no
very
welcome
face
when
he
said
it
was
well
with
him
she
sat
down
by
his
side
still
holding
one
hand
firmly
and
softly
detaining
the
other
oh
my
friend
may
i
believe
you
may
i
speak
to
you
she
leaned
close
to
him
you
know
my
heart
i
have
no
better
ambition
than
to
be
your
friend
surely
i
divide
your
grief
and
may
i
not
claim
your
confidence
who
has
wept
more
over
your
great
and
dreadful
sorrows
i
would
not
have
come
to
you
but
i
do
believe
that
sorrow
shared
relieves
the
burden
and
it
is
now
that
you
may
feel
a
woman
aid
and
something
of
what
a
woman
could
be
to
you
be
assured
he
gravely
said
i
thank
you
emmeline
for
your
intentions
no
no
not
for
my
intentions
and
do
not
thank
me
think
of
him
think
of
your
dear
boy
our
richard
as
we
have
called
oh
do
not
think
it
a
foolish
superstition
of
mine
but
i
have
had
a
thought
this
night
that
has
kept
me
in
torment
till
i
rose
to
speak
to
you
tell
me
first
you
have
forgiven
him
a
father
bears
no
malice
to
his
son
emmeline
your
heart
has
forgiven
him
my
heart
has
taken
what
he
gave
and
quite
forgiven
him
you
will
hear
no
complaints
of
mine
the
lady
paused
despondingly
and
looked
at
him
in
a
wistful
manner
saying
with
a
sigh
yes
i
know
how
noble
you
are
and
different
from
others
he
drew
one
of
his
hands
from
her
relaxed
hold
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
emmeline
i
can
not
sleep
go
and
talk
to
me
another
time
no
it
must
be
now
you
have
helped
me
when
i
struggled
to
rise
into
a
clearer
world
and
i
think
humble
as
i
am
i
can
help
you
now
i
have
had
a
thought
this
night
that
if
you
do
not
pray
for
him
and
bless
him
it
will
end
miserably
my
friend
have
you
done
so
he
was
stung
and
offended
and
could
hardly
help
showing
it
in
spite
of
his
mask
have
you
done
so
austin
this
is
assuredly
a
new
way
of
committing
fathers
to
the
follies
of
their
sons
emmeline
no
not
that
but
will
you
pray
for
your
boy
and
bless
him
before
the
day
comes
he
restrained
himself
to
pronounce
his
words
calmly
and
i
must
do
this
or
it
will
end
in
misery
how
else
can
it
end
can
i
save
him
from
the
seed
he
has
sown
consider
emmeline
what
you
say
he
has
repeated
his
cousin
sin
you
see
the
end
of
that
oh
so
different
this
young
person
is
not
is
not
of
the
class
poor
austin
wentworth
allied
himself
to
indeed
it
is
different
and
he
be
just
and
admit
his
nobleness
i
fancied
you
did
this
young
person
has
great
beauty
she
has
the
elements
of
good
breeding
she
indeed
i
think
had
she
been
in
another
position
you
would
not
have
looked
upon
her
unfavourably
she
may
be
too
good
for
my
son
the
baronet
spoke
with
sublime
bitterness
no
woman
is
too
good
for
richard
and
you
know
it
pass
her
yes
i
will
speak
only
of
him
he
met
her
by
a
fatal
accident
we
thought
his
love
dead
and
so
did
he
till
he
saw
her
again
he
met
her
he
thought
we
were
plotting
against
him
he
thought
he
should
lose
her
for
ever
and
is
the
madness
of
an
hour
he
did
this
my
emmeline
pleads
bravely
for
clandestine
matches
ah
do
not
trifle
my
friend
say
would
you
have
had
him
act
as
young
men
in
his
position
generally
do
to
young
women
beneath
them
sir
austin
did
not
like
the
question
it
probed
him
very
severely
you
mean
he
said
that
fathers
must
fold
their
arms
and
either
submit
to
infamous
marriages
or
have
these
creatures
ruined
i
do
not
mean
that
exclaimed
the
lady
striving
for
what
she
did
mean
and
how
to
express
it
i
mean
that
he
loved
her
is
it
not
a
madness
at
his
age
but
what
i
chiefly
mean
is
save
him
from
the
consequences
no
you
shall
not
withdraw
your
hand
think
of
his
pride
his
sensitiveness
his
great
wild
nature
wild
when
he
is
set
wrong
think
how
intense
it
is
set
upon
love
think
my
friend
do
not
forget
his
love
for
you
sir
austin
smiled
an
admirable
smile
of
pity
that
i
should
save
him
or
any
one
from
consequences
is
asking
more
than
the
order
of
things
will
allow
to
you
emmeline
and
is
not
in
the
disposition
of
this
world
i
can
not
consequences
are
the
natural
offspring
of
acts
my
child
you
are
talking
sentiment
which
is
the
distraction
of
our
modern
age
in
everything
a
phantasmal
vapour
distorting
the
image
of
the
life
we
live
you
ask
me
to
give
him
a
golden
age
in
spite
of
himself
all
that
could
be
done
by
keeping
him
in
the
paths
of
virtue
and
truth
i
did
he
is
become
a
man
and
as
a
man
he
must
reap
his
own
sowing
the
baffled
lady
sighed
he
sat
so
rigid
he
spoke
so
securely
as
if
wisdom
were
to
him
more
than
the
love
of
his
son
and
yet
he
did
love
his
son
feeling
sure
that
he
loved
his
son
while
he
spoke
so
loftily
she
reverenced
him
still
baffled
as
she
was
and
sensible
that
she
had
been
quibbled
with
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
open
your
heart
to
him
she
said
he
kept
silent
call
him
a
man
he
is
and
must
ever
be
the
child
of
your
education
my
friend
you
would
console
me
emmeline
with
the
prospect
that
if
he
ruins
himself
he
spares
the
world
of
young
women
yes
that
is
something
closely
she
scanned
the
mask
it
was
impenetrable
he
could
meet
her
eyes
and
respond
to
the
pressure
of
her
hand
and
smile
and
not
show
what
he
felt
nor
did
he
deem
it
hypocritical
to
seek
to
maintain
his
elevation
in
her
soft
soul
by
simulating
supreme
philosophy
over
offended
love
nor
did
he
know
that
he
had
an
angel
with
him
then
a
blind
angel
and
a
weak
one
but
one
who
struck
upon
his
chance
am
i
pardoned
for
coming
to
you
she
said
after
a
pause
surely
i
can
read
my
emmeline
intentions
he
gently
replied
very
poor
ones
i
feel
my
weakness
i
can
not
utter
half
i
have
been
thinking
oh
if
i
could
you
speak
very
well
emmeline
at
least
i
am
pardoned
surely
so
and
before
i
leave
you
dear
friend
shall
i
be
forgiven
may
i
beg
it
will
you
bless
him
he
was
again
silent
pray
for
him
austin
pray
for
him
ere
the
night
is
over
as
she
spoke
she
slid
down
to
his
feet
and
pressed
his
hand
to
her
bosom
the
baronet
was
startled
in
very
dread
of
the
soft
fit
that
wooed
him
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
and
went
to
the
window
it
day
already
he
said
with
assumed
vivacity
throwing
open
the
shutters
and
displaying
the
young
light
on
the
lawn
lady
blandish
dried
her
tears
as
she
knelt
and
then
joined
him
and
glanced
up
silently
at
richard
moon
standing
in
wane
toward
the
west
she
hoped
it
was
because
of
her
having
been
premature
in
pleading
so
earnestly
that
she
had
failed
to
move
him
and
she
accused
herself
more
than
the
baronet
but
in
acting
as
she
had
done
she
had
treated
him
as
no
common
man
and
she
was
compelled
to
perceive
that
his
heart
was
at
present
hardly
superior
to
the
hearts
of
ordinary
men
however
composed
his
face
might
be
and
apparently
serene
his
wisdom
from
that
moment
she
grew
critical
of
him
and
began
to
study
her
idol
a
process
dangerous
to
idols
he
now
that
she
seemed
to
have
relinquished
the
painful
subject
drew
to
her
and
as
one
who
wished
to
smooth
a
foregone
roughness
murmured
god
rarest
blessing
is
after
all
a
good
woman
my
emmeline
bears
her
sleepless
night
well
she
does
not
shame
the
day
he
gazed
down
on
her
with
a
fondling
tenderness
i
could
bear
many
many
she
replied
meeting
his
eyes
and
you
would
see
me
look
better
and
better
if
if
only
but
she
had
no
encouragement
to
end
the
sentence
perhaps
he
wanted
some
mute
form
of
consolation
perhaps
the
handsome
placid
features
of
the
dame
touched
him
at
any
rate
their
platonism
was
advanced
by
his
putting
an
arm
about
her
she
felt
the
arm
and
talked
of
the
morning
thus
proximate
they
by
and
by
both
heard
something
very
like
a
groan
behind
them
and
looking
round
beheld
the
saurian
eye
lady
blandish
smiled
but
the
baronet
discomposure
was
not
to
be
concealed
by
a
strange
fatality
every
stage
of
their
innocent
loves
was
certain
to
have
a
human
beholder
oh
i
sure
i
beg
pardon
benson
mumbled
arresting
his
head
in
a
melancholy
pendulosity
he
was
ordered
out
of
the
room
and
i
think
i
shall
follow
him
and
try
to
get
forty
winks
said
lady
blandish
they
parted
with
a
quiet
squeeze
of
hands
the
baronet
then
called
in
benson
get
me
my
breakfast
as
soon
as
you
can
he
said
regardless
of
the
aspect
of
injured
conscience
benson
sombrely
presented
to
him
i
am
going
to
town
early
and
benson
he
added
you
will
also
go
to
town
this
afternoon
or
if
it
suits
you
and
take
your
book
with
you
to
thompson
you
will
not
return
here
a
provision
will
be
made
for
you
you
can
go
the
heavy
butler
essayed
to
speak
but
the
tremendous
blow
and
the
baronet
gesture
choked
him
at
the
door
he
made
another
effort
which
shook
the
rolls
of
his
loose
skin
pitiably
an
impatient
signal
sent
him
out
dumb
and
raynham
was
quit
of
the
one
believer
in
the
great
shaddock
dogma

although

when
