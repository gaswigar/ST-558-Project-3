note
this
volume
contains
all
the
essays
on
the
chalicodomae
or
proper
which
so
greatly
enhance
the
interest
of
the
early
volumes
of
the
souvenirs
entomologiques
i
have
also
included
an
essay
on
the
author
cats
and
one
on
red
ants
the
only
study
of
ants
comprised
in
the
souvenirs
both
of
which
bear
upon
the
sense
of
direction
possessed
by
the
bees
those
treating
of
the
osmiae
who
are
also
although
not
usually
known
by
that
name
will
be
found
in
a
separate
volume
which
i
have
called
and
others
and
in
which
i
have
collected
all
that
fabre
has
written
on
such
other
wild
bees
as
the
megachiles
or
the
the
and
the
halicti
the
essays
entitled
the
experiments
and
exchanging
the
nests
form
the
last
three
chapters
of
insect
life
translated
by
the
author
of
mademoiselle
mori
and
published
by
macmillan
who
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
kindness
have
given
me
their
permission
to
include
a
new
translation
of
these
chapters
in
the
present
volume
they
did
so
without
fee
or
consideration
of
any
kind
merely
on
my
representation
that
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
this
uniform
edition
of
fabre
works
should
be
rendered
incomplete
because
certain
essays
formed
part
of
volumes
of
extracts
previously
published
in
this
country
their
generosity
is
almost
unparalleled
in
my
experience
and
i
wish
to
thank
them
publicly
for
it
in
the
name
of
the
author
of
the
french
publishers
and
of
the
english
and
american
publishers
as
well
as
in

have
again
to

miss

for
the
invaluable
assistance
which
she
has
given
me
in

work
of

devoted
one
of
his
papers
to
the
story
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
whom
he
calls
the
i
propose
to
go
on
with
the
story
to
complete
it
and
especially
to
consider
it
from
a
point
of
view
wholly
neglected
by
that
eminent
observer
and
first
of
all
i
am
tempted
to
tell
how
i
made
this
bee
acquaintance
it
was
when
i
first
began
to
teach
about
i
had
left
the
normal
school
at
vaucluse
some
months
before
with
my
diploma
and
all
the
simple
enthusiasm
of
my
eighteen
years
and
had
been
sent
to
carpentras
there
to
manage
the
primary
school
attached
to
the
college
it
was
a
strange
school
upon
my
word
notwithstanding
its
pompous
title
of
a
sort
of
huge
cellar
oozing
with
the
perpetual
damp
engendered
by
a
well
backing
on
it
in
the
street
outside
for
light
there
was
the
open
door
when
the
weather
permitted
and
a
narrow
with
iron
bars
and
lozenge
panes
set
in
lead
by
way
of
benches
there
was
a
plank
fastened
to
the
wall
all
round
the
room
while
in
the
middle
was
a
chair
bereft
of
its
straw
a
and
a
stick
of
chalk
morning
and
evening
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
there
came
rushing
in
some
fifty
young
imps
who
having
shown
themselves
hopeless
dunces
with
their
cornelius
nepos
had
been
relegated
in
the
phrase
of
the
day
to
few
good
years
of
french
those
who
had
found
mensa
too
much
for
them
came
to
me
to
get
a
smattering
of
grammar
children
and
strapping
lads
were
there
mixed
up
together
at
very
different
educational
stages
but
all
incorrigibly
agreed
to
play
tricks
upon
the
master
the
boy
master
who
was
no
older
than
some
of
them
or
even
younger
to
the
little
ones
i
gave
their
first
lessons
in
reading
the
intermediate
ones
i
showed
how
they
should
hold
their
pen
to
write
a
few
lines
of
dictation
on
their
knees
to
the
big
ones
i
revealed
the
secrets
of
fractions
and
even
the
mysteries
of
euclid
and
to
keep
this
restless
crowd
in
order
to
give
each
mind
work
in
accordance
with
its
strength
to
keep
attention
aroused
and
lastly
to
expel
dullness
from
the
gloomy
room
whose
walls
dripped
melancholy
even
more
than
dampness
my
one
resource
was
my
tongue
my
one
weapon
my
stick
of
chalk
for
that
matter
there
was
the
same
contempt
in
the
other
classes
for
all
that
was
not
latin
or
greek
one
instance
will
be
enough
to
show
how
things
then
stood
with
the
teaching
of
physics
the
science
which
occupies
so
large
a
place
the
principal
of
the
college
was
a
man
the
worthy
abbe
who
not
caring
to
dispense
beans
and
bacon
himself
had
left
the
to
a
relative
and
had
undertaken
to
teach
the
boys
physics
let
us
attend
one
of
his
lessons
the
subject
is
the
barometer
the
establishment
happens
to
possess
one
an
old
apparatus
covered
with
dust
hanging
on
the
wall
beyond
the
reach
of
profane
hands
and
bearing
on
its
face
in
large
letters
the
words
stormy
rain
fair
barometer
says
the
good
abbe
addressing
his
pupils
whom
in
patriarchal
fashion
he
calls
by
their
christian
names
barometer
tells
us
if
the
weather
will
be
good
or
bad
you
see
the
words
written
on
the
face
stormy
rain
do
you
see
bastien
i
see
says
bastien
the
most
mischievous
of
the
lot
he
has
been
looking
through
his
book
and
knows
more
about
the
barometer
than
his
teacher
does
consists
the
abbe
continues
a
bent
glass
tube
filled
with
mercury
which
rises
and
falls
according
to
the
weather
the
shorter
leg
of
this
tube
is
open
the
other
the
other
well
we
see
here
bastien
you
the
tallest
get
up
on
the
chair
and
just
feel
with
your
finger
if
the
long
leg
is
open
or
closed
i
ca
remember
for
certain
bastien
climbs
on
the
chair
stands
as
high
as
he
can
on
and
fumbles
with
his
finger
at
the
top
of
the
long
column
then
with
a
discreet
smile
spreading
under
the
silky
hairs
of
his
dawning
moustache
he
says
it
the
long
leg
is
open
at
the
top
there
i
can
feel
the
hole
and
bastien
to
confirm
his
mendacious
statement
keeps
wriggling
his
forefinger
at
the
top
of
the
tube
while
his
suppress
their
enjoyment
as
best
they
can
will
do
says
the
unconscious
abbe
can
get
down
bastien
take
a
note
of
it
boys
the
longer
leg
of
the
barometer
is
open
take
a
note
of
it
it
a
thing
you
might
forget
i
had
forgotten
it
myself
thus
was
physics
taught
things
improved
however
a
master
came
and
came
to
stay
one
who
knew
that
the
long
leg
of
the
barometer
is
closed
i
myself
secured
tables
on
which
my
pupils
were
able
to
write
instead
of
scribbling
on
their
knees
and
as
my
class
was
daily
increasing
in
numbers
it
ended
by
being
divided
into
two
as
soon
as
i
had
an
assistant
to
look
after
the
younger
boys
things
assumed
a
different
aspect
among
the
subjects
taught
one
in
particular
appealed
to
both
masters
and
pupils
this
was
geometry
practical
surveying
the
college
had
none
of
the
necessary
outfit
but
with
my
fat
pay
seven
hundred
francs
a
year
if
you
please
i
could
not
hesitate
over
the
expense
a
surveyor
chain
and
stakes
arrows
level
square
and
compass
were
bought
with
my
money
a
microscopic
graphometer
not
much
larger
than
the
palm
of
one
hand
and
costing
perhaps
five
francs
was
provided
by
the
establishment
there
was
no
tripod
to
it
and
i
had
one
made
in
short
my
equipment
was
complete
and
so
when
may
came
once
every
week
we
left
the
gloomy
for
the
fields
it
was
a
regular
holiday
the
boys
disputed
for
the
honour
of
carrying
the
stakes
divided
into
bundles
of
three
and
more
than
one
shoulder
as
we
walked
through
the
town
felt
the
reflected
glory
of
those
erudite
rods
i
myself
why
conceal
the
fact
was
not
without
a
certain
satisfaction
as
i
piously
carried
that
most
delicate
and
precious
apparatus
the
historic
graphometer
the
scene
of
operations
was
an
untilled
flinty
plain
a
harmas
as
we
call
it
in
the
district
cf

note
here
no
curtain
of
green
hedges
or
shrubs
prevented
me
from
keeping
an
eye
upon
my
staff
here
an
indispensable
condition
i
had
not
the
irresistible
temptation
of
the
unripe
apricots
to
fear
for
my
scholars
the
plain
stretched
far
and
wide
covered
with
nothing
but
flowering
thyme
and
rounded
pebbles
there
was
ample
scope
for
every
imaginable
polygon
trapezes
and
triangles
could
be
combined
in
all
sorts
of
ways
the
inaccessible
distances
had
ample
and
there
was
even
an
old
ruin
once
a
that
lent
its
perpendicular
to
the
graphometer
performances
well
from
the
very
first
day
my
attention
was
attracted
by
something
suspicious
if
i
sent
one
of
the
boys
to
plant
a
stake
i
would
see
him
stop
frequently
on
his
way
bend
down
stand
up
again
look
about
and
stoop
once
more
neglecting
his
straight
line
and
his
signals
another
who
was
told
to
pick
up
the
arrows
would
forget
the
iron
pin
and
take
up
a
pebble
instead
and
a
third
deaf
to
the
measurements
of
angles
would
crumble
a
clod
of
earth
between
his
fingers
most
of
them
were
caught
licking
a
bit
of
straw
the
polygon
came
to
a
full
stop
the
diagonals
suffered
what
could
the
mystery
be
i
enquired
and
everything
was
explained
a
born
searcher
and
observer
the
scholar
had
long
known
what
the
master
had
not
yet
heard
of
namely
that
there
was
a
big
black
bee
who
made
clay
nests
on
the
pebbles
in
the
harmas
these
nests
contained
honey
and
my
surveyors
used
to
open
them
and
empty
the
cells
with
a
straw
the
honey
although
rather
was
most
acceptable
i
acquired
a
taste
for
it
myself
and
joined
the
putting
off
the
polygon
till
later
it
was
thus
that
i
first
saw
reaumur
knowing
nothing
of
her
history
and
nothing
of
her
historian
the
magnificent
bee
herself
with
her
wings
and
raiment
her
rustic
edifices
on
the
pebbles
amid
the
thyme
her
honey
providing
a
diversion
from
the
severities
of
the
compass
and
the
square
all
made
a
great
impression
on
my
mind
and
i
wanted
to
know
more
than
i
had
learnt
from
the
schoolboys
which
was
just
how
to
rob
the
cells
of
their
honey
with
a
straw
as
it
happened
my

everything
food

anything
extra
that
i
gave
to
the

i
could

who
look
to

effected
that
day
my
professional
emoluments
were
severely
strained
i
devoted
a
month
salary
to
the
acquisition
of
the
book
i
had
to
resort
to
miracles
of
economy

some
time

come
before
making
up
the
enormous
deficit
the
book
was
devoured
there
is
no
other

it
in
it
i
learnt
the
name
of
my
black
bee
i
read
for
the
first
time
various
details
of
the
habits
of
insects
i
found
surrounded
in
my
eyes
with
a
sort
of
halo
the
revered
names
of
reaumur
huber
francois
huber
the
swiss
naturalist
author
of

and
while
i
turned
over
the
pages
for
the
hundredth

a
voice
within
me
seemed
to
whisper
also
shall
be
of
their
company
ah
fond
illusions
what
has
come
of
you
the
present
essay
is
one
of
the
earliest
in
the
souvenirs
entomologiques
translator
note
but
let
us
banish
these
recollections
at
once
sweet
and
sad
and
speak
of
the
doings
of
our
black
bee
chalicodoma
meaning
a
house
of
pebbles
concrete
or
mortar
would
be
a
most
satisfactory
title
were
it
not
that
it
has
an
odd
sound
to
any
one
unfamiliar
with
greek
the
name
is
given
to
bees
who
build
their
cells
with
materials
similar
to
those
which
we
employ
for
our
own
dwellings
the
work
of
these
insects
is
masonry
only
it
is
turned
out
by
a
rustic
mason
more
used
to
hard
clay
than
to
hewn
stone
reaumur
who
knew
nothing
of
scientific
classification
a
fact
which
makes
many
of
his
papers
very
difficult
to
understand
named
the
worker
after
her
work
and
called
our
builders
in
dried
clay
which
describes
them
exactly
we
have
two
of
them
in
our
district
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
chalicodoma
muraria
whose
history
reaumur
gives
us
in
a
masterly
fashion
and
the
sicilian
chalicodoma
sicula
for
reasons
that
will
become
apparent
after
the
reader
has
learnt
their
habits
the
author
also
speaks
of
the
of
the
walls
and
the
sicilian
as
the
of
the
pebbles
and
the
of
the
sheds
respectively
cf

who
is
not
peculiar
to
the
land
of
etna
as
her
name
might
suggest
but
is
also
found
in
greece
in
algeria
and
in
the
south
of
france
particularly
in
the
department
of
vaucluse
where
she
is
one
of
the
commonest
bees
to
be
seen
in
the
month
of
may
in
the
first
species
the
two
sexes
are
so
unlike
in
colouring
that
a
novice
surprised
at
observing
them
come
out
of
the
same
nest
would
at
first
take
them
for
strangers
to
each
other
the
female
is
of
a
splendid
velvety
black
with
wings
in
the
male
the
black
velvet
is
replaced
by
a
rather
bright
fleece
the
second
species
which
is
much
smaller
does
not
show
this
contrast
of
colour
the
two
sexes
wear
the
same
costume
a
general
mixture
of
brown
red
and
grey
while
the
tips
of
the
wings
washed
with
violet
on
a
bronzed
ground
recall
but
only
faintly
the
rich
purple
of
the
first
species
both
begin
their
labours
at
the
same
period
in
the
early
part
of
may
as
reaumur
tells
us
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
in
the
northern
provinces
selects
a
wall
directly
facing
the
sun
and
one
not
covered
with
plaster
which
might
come
off
and
imperil
the
future
of
the
cells
she
confides
her
buildings
only
to
solid
foundations
such
as
bare
stones
i
find
her
equally
prudent
in
the
south
but
for
some
reason
which
i
do
not
know
she
here
generally
prefers
some
other
base
to
the
stone
of
a
wall
a
rounded
pebble
often
hardly
larger
than
one
fist
one
of
those
cobbles
with
which
the
waters
of
the
glacial
period
covered
the
terraces
of
the
rhone
valley
forms
the
most
popular
support
the
extreme
abundance
of
these
sites
might
easily
influence
the
choice
all
our
less
elevated
uplands
all
our
arid
grounds
are
nothing
but
stones
cemented
with
red
earth
in
the
valleys
the
chalicodoma
has
also
the
pebbles
of
the
at
her
disposal
near
orange
for
instance
her
favourite
spots
are
the
alluvia
of
the
aygues
with
their
carpets
of
smooth
pebbles
no
longer
visited
by
the
waters
lastly
if
a
cobble
be
wanting
the
will
establish
her
nest
on
any
sort
of
stone
on
a
or
a
the
sicilian
chalicodoma
has
an
even
greater
variety
of
choice
her
most
cherished
site
is
the
lower
surface
of
the
projecting
tiles
of
a
roof
there
is
not
a
cottage
in
the
fields
however
small
but
shelters
her
nests
under
the
eaves
here
each
spring
she
settles
in
populous
colonies
whose
masonry
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
and
enlarged
year
by
year
ends
by
covering
considerable
surfaces
i
have
seen
some
of
these
nests
under
the
tiles
of
a
shed
spreading
over
an
area
of
five
or
six
square
yards
when
the
colony
was
hard
at
work
the
busy
buzzing
crowd
was
enough
to
make
one
giddy
the
under
side
of
a
balcony
also
pleases
the
as
does
the
embrasure
of
a
disused
window
especially
if
it
is
closed
by
a
blind
whose
slats
allow
her
a
free
passage
but
these
are
popular
resorts
where
hundreds
and
thousands
of
workers
labour
each
for
herself
if
she
be
alone
which
happens
pretty
often
the
sicilian
instals
herself
in
the
first
little
nook
handy
provided
that
it
supplies
a
solid
foundation
and
warmth
as
for
the
nature
of
this
foundation
she
does
not
seem
to
mind
i
have
seen
her
build
on
the
bare
stone
on
bricks
on
the
wood
of
a
shutter
and
even
on
the
of
a
shed
one
thing
only
does
not
suit
her
the
plaster
of
our
houses
she
is
as
prudent
as
her
kinswoman
and
would
fear
the
ruin
of
her
cells
if
she
entrusted
them
to
a
support
which
might
possibly
fall
lastly
for
reasons
which
i
am
still
unable
to
explain
to
my
own
satisfaction
the
sicilian
often
changes
the
position
of
her
building
entirely
turning
her
heavy
house
of
clay
which
would
seem
to
require
the
solid
support
of
a
rock
into
an
aerial
dwelling
a
of
any
kind
whatever

provides
her
with
a
foundation
usually
as
high
as
a
man

the
and
the
elm
give
her
a
greater
altitude
she
chooses
in
the
bushy
clump
a
twig
no
thicker
than
a
straw
and
on
this
narrow
base
she
constructs
her
edifice
with
the
same
mortar
that
she
would
employ
under
a
balcony
or
the
ledge
of
a
roof
when
finished
the
nest
is
a
ball
of
earth
bisected
by
the

it
is
the
size
of
an
apricot
when
the
work
of
a
single
insect
and
of
one
fist
if
several
have
collaborated
but
this
latter
case
is
rare
both
bees
use
the
same
materials
calcareous
clay
mingled
with
a
little
sand
and
kneaded
into
a
paste
with
the
mason
own
saliva
damp
places
which
would
facilitate
the
quarrying
and
reduce
the
expenditure
of
saliva
for
mixing

mortar
are
scorned
by
the
who
refuse
fresh
earth
for
building
even
as
our
own
builders
refuse
plaster
and
lime
that
have
long
lost
their
these
materials
when
soaked
with
pure
moisture
would
not
hold
properly
what
is
wanted
is
a
dry
dust
which
greedily
absorbs
the
disgorged
saliva
and
forms
with
the
latter
albuminous
elements
a
sort
of
roman
cement
something
in
short
resembling
the
cement
which
we
obtain
with
quicklime
and
white

the
which
the
sicilian
prefers
to
work
is
a
frequented
highway
whose
metal
of
chalky
flints
crushed
by
the
passing
wheels
has
become
a
smooth
surface
like
a
continuous
flagstone
whether
settling
on
a
twig
in
a
hedge
or
fixing
her
abode
under
the
eaves
of
some
rural
dwelling
she
always
goes
for
her
to
the
nearest
path

road
without
allowing
herself
to
be
distracted
from
her
business
by
the
constant
traffic
of
people
and
cattle
you
should
see
the
active
bee
at
work

the
road
is
dazzling
white
under
the
rays
of
a
hot
sun
between
the
adjoining
farm
which
is
the
and
the
road
in
which
the

is
prepared
we
hear
the
deep
hum
of
the
bees
perpetually
crossing
one
another

they

of

exceedingly

to

wisely

wells
around
the
dome
only
one
is
needed
at
the
moment
but
the
bee
rightly
calculates
that
the
others
will
be
useful
presently
for
the
other
eggs
and
she
watches
them
all
with
jealous
vigilance
to
drive
away
possible
visitors
indeed
i
do
not
remember
ever
seeing
two
masons
working
on
the
same
pebble
the
task
is
now
very
simple
the
bee
examines
the
old
cell
to
see
what
parts
require
repairing
she
tears
off
the
strips
of
cocoon
hanging
from
the
walls
removes
the
fragments
of
clay
that
fell
from
the
ceiling
when
pierced
by
the
last
inhabitant
to
make
her
exit
gives
a
coat
of
mortar
to
the
dilapidated
parts
mends
the
opening
a
little
and
that
is
all
next
come
the
storing
the
laying
of
the
eggs
and
the
closing
of
the
chamber
when
all
the
cells
one
after
the
other
are
thus
furnished
the
outer
cover
the
mortar
dome
receives
a
few
repairs
if
it
needs
them
and
the
thing
is
done
the
sicilian
prefers
company
to
a
solitary
life
and
establishes
herself
in
her
hundreds
very
often
in
many
thousands
under
the
tiles
of
a
shed
or
the
edge
of
a
roof
these
do
not
constitute
a
true
society
with
common
interests
to
which
all
attend
but
a
mere
gathering
where
each
works
for
herself
and
is
not
concerned
with
the
rest
in
short
a
throng
of
workers
recalling
the
swarm
of
a
hive
only
by
their
numbers
and
their
eagerness
the
mortar
employed
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
of
the
walls
equally
unyielding
and
waterproof
but
thinner
and
without
pebbles
the
old
nests
are
used
first
every
free
chamber
is
repaired
stocked
and
sealed
up
but
the
old
cells
are
far
from
sufficient
for
the
population
which
increases
rapidly
from
year
to
year
then
on
the
surface
of
the
nest
whose
chambers
are
hidden
under
the
old
general
mortar
covering
new
cells
are
built
as
the
needs
of
the
call
for
them
they
are
placed
horizontally
or
nearly
so
side
by
side
with
no
attempt
at
orderly
arrangement
each
architect
has
plenty
of
and
builds
as
and
where
she
pleases
on
the
one
condition
that
she
does
not
hamper
her
neighbours
work
otherwise
she
can
look
out
for
rough
handling
from
the
parties
interested
the
cells
therefore
accumulate
at
random
in
this
workyard
where
there
is
no
organization
their
shape
is
that
of
a
thimble
divided
down
the
middle
and
their
walls
are
completed
either
by
the
adjoining
cells
or
by
the
surface
of
the
old
nest
outside
they
are
rough
and
display
successive
layers
of
knotted
cords
corresponding
with
the
different
courses
of
mortar
inside
the
walls
are
flat
without
being
smooth
later
on
the
grub
cocoon
will
make
up
for
any
lack
of
polish
each
cell
as
built
is
stocked
and
walled
up
immediately
as
we
have
seen
with
the
of
the
walls
this
work
goes
on
throughout
the
best
part
of
may
all
the
eggs
are
laid
at
last
and
then
the
bees
without
drawing
distinctions
between
what
does
and
what
does
not
belong
to
them
set
to
work
in
common
on
a
general
protection
for
the
colony
this
is
a
thick
coat
of
mortar
which
fills
up
the
gaps
and
covers
all
the
cells
in
the
end
the
common
nest
presents
the
appearance
of
a
wide
expanse
of
dry
mud
with
very
irregular
protuberances
thicker
in
the
middle
the
original
nucleus
of
the
establishment
thinner
at
the
edges
where
as
yet
there
are
only
newly
built
cells
and
varying
greatly
in
dimensions
according
to
the
number
of
workers
and
therefore
to
the
age
of
the
nest
first
founded
some
of
these
nests
are
hardly
larger
than
one
hand
while
others
occupy
the
greater
part
of
the
projecting
edge
of
a
roof
and
are
measured
by
square
yards
when
working
alone
which
is
not
unusual
on
the
shutter
of
a
disused
window
on
a
stone
or
on
a
twig
in
some
hedge
the
sicilian
chalicodoma
behaves
in
just
the
same
way
for
instance
should
she
settle
on
a
twig
the
bee
begins
by
solidly
cementing
the
base
of
her
cell
to
the
slight
foundation
next
the
building
rises
taking
the
form
of
a
little
upright
turret
this
first
cell
when
victualled
and
sealed
is
followed
by
another
having
as
its
support
in
addition
to
the
twig
the
cells
already
built
from
six
to
ten
chambers
are
thus
grouped
side
by
side
lastly
one
coat
of
mortar
covers
everything
including
the
twig
itself
which
provides
a
firm
mainstay
for
the
whole
chapter
experiments
as
the
nests
of
the
of

are
erected
on

be
easily

wherever
you

from

place
to

without
disturbing
either
the
work
of

or
the
repose
of
the
occupants
of

they

that

reaumur
as
a
rule
confines
himself
to
stating
facts
as
he
sees
them
in
the
normal
course
of
events
and
does
not
try
to
probe
deeper
into
the
insect
ingenuity
by
means
of
artificially
produced
conditions
in
his
time
everything
had
yet
to
be
done
and
the
harvest
was
so
great
that
the
illustrious
harvester
went
straight
to
what
was
most
urgent
the
gathering
of
the
crop
and
left
his
successors
to
examine
the
grain
and
the
ear
in
detail
nevertheless
in
connection
with
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
he
mentions
an
experiment
made
by
his
friend
duhamel
henri
louis
duhamel
du
monceau
a
distinguished
writer
on
botany
and
translator
note
he
tells
us
how
a
nest
was
enclosed
in
a
glass
funnel
the
mouth
of
which
was
covered
merely
with
a
bit
of
gauze
from
it
there
issued
three
males
who
after
vanquishing
mortar
as
hard
as
stone
either
never
thought
of
piercing
the
flimsy
gauze
or
else
deemed
the
work
beyond
their
strength
the
three
bees
died
under
the
funnel
reaumur
adds
that
insects
generally
know
only
how
to
do
what
they
have
to
do
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
the
experiment
does
not
satisfy
me
for
two
reasons
first
to
ask
workers
equipped
with
tools
for
cutting
clay
as
hard
as
granite
to
cut
a
piece
of
gauze
does
not
strike
me
as
a
happy
inspiration
you
can
not
expect
a
navvy
to
do
the
same
work
as
a
scissors
secondly
the
transparent
glass
prison
seems
to
me
as
soon
as
the
insect
has
made
a
passage
through
the
thickness
of
its
earthen
dome
it
finds
itself
in
broad
daylight
and
to
it
daylight
means
the
final
deliverance
means
liberty
it
strikes
against
an
invisible
obstacle
the
glass
and
to
it
glass
is
nothing
at
all
and
yet
an
obstruction
on
the
far
side
it
sees
free
space
bathed
in
sunshine
it
wears
itself
out
in
efforts
to
fly
there
unable
to
understand
the
futile
nature
of
its
attempts
against
that
strange
barrier
which
it
can
not
see
it
perishes
at
last
of
exhaustion
without
in
its
obstinacy
giving
a
glance
at
the
gauze
closing
the
conical
chimney
the
experiment
must
be
renewed
under
better
conditions
the
obstacle
which
i
select
is
ordinary
brown
paper
stout
enough
to
keep
the
insect
in
the
dark
and
thin
enough
not
to
offer
serious
resistance
to
the
prisoner
efforts
as
there
is
a
great
difference
in
so
far
as
the
actual
nature
of
the
barrier
is
concerned
between
a
paper
partition
and
a
clay
ceiling
let
us
begin
by
enquiring
if
the
of
the
walls
knows
how
or
rather
is
able
to
make
her
way
through
one
of
these
partitions
the
mandibles
are
pickaxes
suitable
for
breaking
through
hard
mortar
are
they
also
scissors
capable
of
cutting
a
thin
membrane
this
is
the
point
to
look
into
first
of
all
in
february
by
which
time
the
insect
is
in
its
perfect
state
i
take
a
certain
number
of
cocoons
without
damaging
them
from
their
cells
and
insert
them
each
in
a
separate
stump
of
reed
closed
at
one
end
by
the
natural
wall
of
the
node
and
open
at
the
other
these
pieces
of
reed
represent
the
cells
of
the
nest
the
cocoons
are
introduced
with
the
insect
head
turned
towards
the
opening
lastly
my
artificial
cells
are
closed
in
different
ways
some
receive
a
stopper
of
kneaded
clay
which
when
dry
will
correspond
in
thickness
and
consistency
with
the
mortar
ceiling
of
the
natural
nest
others
are
plugged
with
a
cylinder
of
sorghum
at
least
a
centimetre
inch
translator
note
thick
and
the
remainder
with
a
disk
of
brown
paper
solidly
fastened
by
the
edge
all
these
bits
of
reed
are
placed
side
by
side
in
a
box
standing
upright
with
the
roof
of
my
making
at
the
top
the
insects
therefore
are
in
the
exact
position
which
they
occupied
in
the
nest
to
open
a
passage
they
must
do
what
they
would
have
done
without
my
interference
they
must
break
through
the
wall
situated
above
their
heads
i
shelter
the
whole
under
a
wide
and
wait
for
the
month
of
may
the
period
of
the
deliverance
the
results
far
exceed
my
anticipations
the
clay
stopper
the
work
of
my
fingers
is
perforated
with
a
round
hole
differing
in
no
wise
from
that
which
the
contrives
through
her
native
mortar
dome
the
vegetable
barrier
new
to
my
prisoners
namely
the
sorghum
cylinder
also
opens
with
a
neat
orifice
which
might
have
been
the
work
of
a
punch
lastly
the
cover
allows
the
bee
to
make
her
exit
not
by
bursting
through
by
making
a
violent
rent
but
once
more
by
a
clearly
defined
round
hole
my
bees
therefore
are
capable
of
a
task
for
which
they
were
not
born
to
come
out
of
their
reed
cells
they
do
what
probably
none
of
their
race
did
before
them
they
perforate
the
wall
of
they
make
a
hole
in
the
paper
barrier
just
as
they
would
have
pierced
their
natural
clay
ceiling
when
the
moment
comes
to
free
themselves
the
nature
of
the
impediment
does
not
stop
them
provided
that
it
be
not
beyond
their
strength
and
henceforth
the
argument
of
incapacity
can
not
be
raised
when
a
mere
paper
barrier
is
in
question
in
addition
to
the
cells
made
out
of
bits
of
reed
i
put
under
the
at
the
same
time
two
nests
which
are
intact
and
still
resting
on
their
pebbles
to
one
of
them
i
have
attached
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
pressed
close
against
the
mortar
dome
in
order
to
come
out
the
insect
will
have
to
pierce
first
the
dome
and
then
the
paper
which
follows
without
any
intervening
space
over
the
other
i
have
placed
a
little
brown
paper
cone
gummed
to
the
pebble
there
is
here
therefore
as
in
the
first
case
a
double
wall
a
clay
partition
and
a
paper
partition
with
this
difference
that
the
two
walls
do
not
come
immediately
after
each
other
but
are
separated
by
an
empty
space
of
about
a
centimetre
at
the
bottom
increasing
as
the
cone
rises
the
results
of
these
two
experiments
are
quite
different
the
bees
in
the
nest
to
which
a
sheet
of
paper
was
tightly
stuck
come
out
by
piercing
the
two
enclosures
of
which
the
outer
wall
the
paper
wrapper
is
perforated
with
a
very
clean
round
hole
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
reed
cells
closed
with
a
lid
of
the
same
material
we
thus
become
aware
for
the
second
time
that
when
the
is
stopped
by
a
paper
barrier
the
reason
is
not
her
incapacity
to
overcome
the
obstacle
on
the
other
hand
the
occupants
of
the
nest
covered
with
the
cone
after
making
their
way
through
the
earthen
dome
finding
the
sheet
of
paper
at
some
distance
do
not
even
try
to
perforate
this
obstacle
which
they
would
have
conquered
so
easily
had
it
been
fastened
to
the
nest
they
die
under
the
cover
without
making
any
attempt
to
escape
even
so
did
reaumur
bees
perish
in
the
glass
funnel
where
their
liberty
depended
only
upon
their
cutting
through
a
bit
of
gauze
this
fact
strikes
me
as
rich
in
inferences
what
here
are
sturdy
insects
to
whom
boring
through
granite
is
mere
play
to
whom
a
stopper
of
soft
wood
and
a
paper
partition
are
walls
quite
easy
to
perforate
despite
the
novelty
of
the
material
and
yet
these
vigorous
housebreakers
allow
themselves
to
perish
stupidly
in
the
prison
of
a
paper
bag
which
they
could
have
torn
open
with
one
stroke
of
their
mandibles
they
are
capable
of
tearing
it
but
they
do
not
dream
of
doing
so
there
can
be
only
one
explanation
of
this
suicidal
inaction
the
insect
is
with
tools
and
instinctive
faculties
for
accomplishing
the
final
act
of
its
metamorphosis
namely
the
act
of
emerging
from
the
cocoon
and
from
the
cell
its
mandibles
provide
it
with
scissors
file
and
lever
wherewith
to
cut
gnaw
through
and
demolish
either
its
cocoon
and
its
mortar
enclosure
or
any
other
not
too
obstinate
barrier
substituted
for
the
natural
covering
of
the
nest
moreover
and
this
is
an
important
proviso
except
for
which
the
outfit
would
be
useless
it
has
i
will
not
say
the
will
to
use
those
tools
but
a
secret
stimulus
inviting
it
to
employ
them
when
the
hour
for
the
emergence
arrives
this
stimulus
is
aroused
and
the
insect
sets
to
work
to
bore
a
passage
it
little
cares
in
this
case
whether
the
material
to
be
pierced
be
the
natural
mortar
or
paper
the
lid
that
holds
it
imprisoned
does
not
resist
for
long
nor
even
does
it
care
if
the
obstacle
be
increased
in
thickness
and
a
paper
wall
be
added
outside
the
wall
of
clay
the
two
barriers
with
no
interval
between
them
form
but
one
to
the
bee
who
passes
through
them
because
the
act
of
getting
out
is
still
one
act
and
one
only
with
the
paper
cone
whose
wall
is
a
little
way
off
the
conditions
are
changed
though
the
total
thickness
of
wall
is
really
the
same
once
outside
its
earthen
abode
the
insect
has
done
all
that
it
was
destined
to
do
in
order
to
release
itself
to
move
freely
on
the
mortar
dome
represents
to
it
the
end
of
the
release
the
end
of
the
act
of
boring
around
the
nest
a
new
barrier
appears
the
wall
made
by
the
paper
bag
but
in
order
to
pierce
this
the
insect
would
have
to
repeat
the
act
which
it
has
just
accomplished
the
act
which
it
is
not
intended
to
perform
more
than
once
in
its
life
it
would
in
short
have
to
make
into
a
double
act
that
which
by
nature
is
a
single
one
and
the
insect
can
not
do
this

the
sole
reason
that
it
has
not
the

and
this
is
the
singular
intellect
in
which
it
is
the
fashion
nowadays
to
see
a
germ
of
human
reason
the

and
the

back
to
the
good
old
notions
of
the

and
its
immortal
destinies
reaumur
tells
us
how
his
friend
duhamel
having
seized
a
with
a
forceps
when
she
had
half
entered
the
cell
head
foremost
to
fill
it
with
carried
her
to
a
closet
at
some
distance
from
the
spot
where
he
captured
her
the
bee
got
away
from
him
in
this
closet
and
flew
out
through
the
window
duhamel
made
straight
for
the
nest
the
mason
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
he
did
and
renewed
her
work
she
only
seemed
a
little
wilder
says
the
narrator
in
conclusion
why
were
you
not
here
with
me
revered
master
on
the
banks
of
the
aygues
which
is
a
vast
expanse
of
pebbles
for
of
the
year
and
a
mighty
torrent
when
it
rains
i
should
have
shown
you
something
infinitely
better
than
the
fugitive
escaping
from
the
forceps
you
would
have
witnessed
and
in
so
doing
would
have
shared
my
surprise
not
the
brief
flight
of
the
mason
who
carried
to
the
nearest
room
releases
herself
and
forthwith
returns
to
her
nest
in
that
familiar
neighbourhood
but
long
journeys
through
unknown
country
you
would
have
seen
the
bee
whom
i
carried
to
a
great
distance
from
her
home
to
quite
unfamiliar
ground
find
her
way
back
with
a
geographical
sense
of
which
the
swallow
the
martin
and
the
would
not
have
been
ashamed
and
you
would
have
asked
yourself
as
i
did
what
incomprehensible
knowledge
of
the
local
map
guides
that
mother
seeking
her
nest
to
come
to
facts
it
is
a
matter
of
repeating
with
the
of
the
walls
my
former
experiments
with
the
cf
insect
life
chapter
translator
note
of
carrying
the
insect
in
the
dark
a
long
way
from
its
nest
marking
it
and
then
leaving
it
to
its
own
resources
in
case
any
one
should
wish
to
try
the
experiment
for
himself
i
make
him
a
present
of
my
manner
of
operation
which
may
save
him
time
at
the
outset
the
insect
intended
for
a
long
journey
must
obviously
be
handled
with
certain
precautions
there
must
be
no
forceps
employed
no
pincers
which
might
maim
a
wing
strain
it
and
weaken
the
power
of
flight
while
the
bee
is
in
her
cell
absorbed
in
her
work
i
place
a
small
glass
over
it
the
mason
when
she
flies
away
rushes
into
the
tube
which
enables
me
without
touching
her
to
transfer
her
at
once
into
a
screw
of
paper
this
i
quickly
close
a
tin
box
an
ordinary
serves
to
convey
the
prisoners
each
in
her
separate
paper
bag
the
most
delicate
business
that
of
marking
each
captive
before
setting
her
free
is
left
to
be
done
on
the
spot
selected
for
the
i
use
chalk
steeped
in
a
strong
solution
of
gum
arabic
the
mixture
applied
to
some
part
of
the
insect
with
a
straw
leaves
a
white
patch
which
soon
dries
and
adheres
to
the
fleece
when
a
particular
has
to
be
marked
so
as
to
distinguish
her
from
another
in
short
experiments
such
as
i
shall
describe
presently
i
confine
myself
to
touching
the
tip
of
the
abdomen
with
my
straw
while
the
insect
is
half
in
the
cell
head
downwards
the
slight
touch
is
not
noticed
by
the
bee
who
continues
her
work
quite
undisturbed
but
the
mark
is
not
very
deep
and
moreover
it
is
in
a
rather
bad
place
for
any
prolonged
experiment
for
the
bee
is
constantly
brushing
her
belly
to
detach
the
pollen
and
is
sure
to
rub
it
off
sooner
or
later
i
therefore
make
another
one
dropping
the
sticky
chalk
right
in
the
middle
of
the
thorax
between
the
wings
it
is
hardly
possible
to
wear
gloves
at
this
work
the
fingers
need
all
their
deftness
to
take
up
the
restless
bee
delicately
and
to
overpower
her
without
rough
pressure
it
is
easily
seen
that
though
the
job
may
yield
no
other
profit
you
are
at
least
sure
of
being
stung
the
sting
can
be
avoided
with
a
little
dexterity
but
not
always
you
have
to
put
up
with
it
in
any
case
the
sting
is
far
less
painful
than
that
of
the
the
white
spot
is
dropped
on
the
thorax
the
mason
flies
off
and
the
mark
dries
on
the
journey
i
start
with
two
of
the
walls
working
at
their
nests
on
the
pebbles
in
the
alluvia
of
the
aygues
not
far
from
serignan
i
carry
them
home
with
me
to
orange
where
i
release
them
after
marking
them
according
to
the
map
the
distance
is
about
two
and
a
half
miles
as
the
crow
flies
the
captives
are
set
at
liberty
in
the
evening
at
a
time
when
the
bees
begin
to
leave
off
work
for
the
day
it
is
therefore
probable
that
my
two
bees
will
spend
their
night
in
the
neighbourhood
next
morning
i
go
to
the
nests
the
weather
is
still
too
cool
and
the
works
are
suspended
when
the
dew
has
gone
the
masons
begin
work
i
see
one
but
without
a
white
spot
bringing
pollen
to
one
of
the
nests
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
travellers
whom
i
am
expecting
she
is
a
stranger
who
finding
the
cell
whose
owner
i
myself
had
exiled
untenanted
has
installed
herself
there
and
made
it
her
property
not
knowing
that
it
is
already
the
property
of
another
she
has
perhaps
been
victualling
it
since
yesterday
evening
close
upon
ten
when
the
heat
is
at
its
full
the
mistress
of
the
house
suddenly
arrives
her
as
the
original
occupant
are
inscribed
for
me
in
undeniable
characters
on
her
thorax
white
with
chalk
here
is
one
of
my
travellers
back
over
waving
corn
over
fields
all
pink
with
sainfoin
she
has
covered
the
two
miles
and
a
half
and
here
she
is
back
at
the
nest
after
foraging
on
the
way
for
the
doughty
creature
arrives
with
her
abdomen
yellow
with
pollen
to
come
home
again
from
the
verge
of
the
horizon
is
wonderful
in
itself
to
come
home
with
a
is
superlative
economy
a
journey
even
a
forced
journey
always
becomes
a
she
finds
the
stranger
in
the
nest
this
i
teach
you
and
the
owner
falls
furiously
upon
the
intruder
who
possibly
was
meaning
no
harm
a
hot
chase
in
now
takes
place
between
the
two
masons
from
time
to
time
they
hover
almost
without
movement
face
to
face
with
only
a
couple
of
inches
separating
them
and
here
doubtless
measuring
forces
with
their
eyes
they
buzz
insults
at
each
other
then
they
go
back
and
alight
on
the
nest
in
dispute
first
one
then
the
other
i
expect
to
see
them
come
to
blows
to
make
them
draw
their
stings
but
my
hopes
are
disappointed
the
duties
of
maternity
speak
in
too
imperious
a
voice
for
them
to
risk
their
lives
and
wipe
out
the
insult
in
a
mortal
duel
the
whole
thing
is
confined
to
hostile
demonstrations
and
a
few
insignificant
cuffs
nevertheless
the
real
proprietress
seems
to
derive
double
courage
and
double
strength
from
the
feeling
that
she
is
in
her
rights
she
takes
up
a
permanent
position
on
the
nest
and
receives
the
other
each
time
that
she
ventures
to
approach
with
an
angry
quiver
of
her
wings
an
unmistakable
sign
of
her
righteous
indignation
the
stranger
at
last
discouraged
retires
from
the
field
forthwith
the
mason
resumes
her
work
as
actively
as
though
she
had
not
just
undergone
the
hardships
of
a
long
journey
one
more
word
on
these
quarrels
about
property
it
is
not
unusual
when
one
is
away
on
an
expedition
for
another
some
homeless
vagabond
to
call
at
the
nest
take
a
fancy
to
it
and
set
to
work
on
it
sometimes
at
the
same
cell
sometimes
at
the
next
if
there
are
several
vacant
which
is
generally
the
case
in
the
old
nests
the
first
occupier
on
her
return
never
fails
to
drive
away
the
intruder
who
always
ends
by
being
turned
out
so
keen
and
invincible
is
the
sense
of
ownership
reversing
the
savage
prussian
maxim
is
right
among
the
right
is
might
for
there
is
no
other
explanation
of
the
invariable
retreat
of
the
usurper
whose
strength
is
not
a
whit
inferior
to
that
of
the
real
owner
if
she
is
less
bold
this
is
because
she
has
not
the
tremendous
moral
support
of
knowing
herself
in
the
right
which
makes
itself
respected
among
equals
even
in
the
brute
creation
the
second
of
my
travellers
does
not
reappear
either
on
the
day
when
the
first
arrived
or
on
the
following
days
i
decide
upon
another
experiment
on
this
occasion
with
five
subjects
the
is
the
same
and
the
place
of
arrival
the
distance
the
time
of
day
all
remain
unchanged
of
the
five
with
whom
i
experiment
i
find
three
at
their
nests
next
day
the
two
others
are
missing
it
is
therefore
fully
established
that
the
of
the
walls
carried
to
a
distance
of
two
and
a
half
miles
and
released
at
a
place
which
she
has
certainly
never
seen
before
is
able
to
return
to
the
nest
but
why
do
first
one
out
of
two
and
then
two
out
of
five
fail
to
join
their
fellows
what
one
can
do
can
not
another
do
is
there
a
difference
in
the
faculty
that
guides
them
over
unknown
ground
or
is
it
not
rather
a
difference
in
i
remember
that
my
bees
did
not
all
start
off
with
the
same
vigour
some
were
hardly
out
of
my
fingers
before
they
darted
furiously
into
the
air
where
i
at
once
lost
sight
of
them
whereas
the
others
came
dropping
down
a
few
yards
away
from
me
after
a
short
flight
the
latter
it
seems
certain
must
have
suffered
on
the
journey
perhaps
from
the
heat
concentrated
in
the
furnace
of
my
box
or
i
may
have
hurt
the
articulation
of
the
wings
in
marking
them
an
operation
difficult
to
perform
when
you
are
guarding
against
stings
these
are
maimed
feeble
creatures
who
will
linger
in
the
close
by
and
not
the
powerful
aviators
required
by
the
journey
the
experiment
must
be
tried
again
taking
count
only
of
the
bees
who
start
off
straight
from
between
my
fingers
with
a
clean
vigorous
flight
the
waverers
the
laggards
who
stop
almost
at
once
on
some
bush
shall
be
left
out
of
the
reckoning
moreover
i
will
do
my
best
to
estimate
the
time
taken
in
returning
to
the
nest
for
an
experiment
of
this
kind
i
need
plenty
of
subjects
as
the
weak
and
the
maimed
of
whom
there
may
be
many
are
to
be
disregarded
the
of
the
walls
is
unable
to
supply
me
with
the
requisite
number
there
are
not
enough
of
her
and
i
am
anxious
not
to
interfere
too
much
with
the
little
colony
for
whom
i
have
other
experiments
in
view
fortunately
i
have
at
my
own
place
under
the
eaves
of
a
shed
a
magnificent
nest
of
chalicodoma
sicula
in
full
activity
i
can
draw
to
whatever
extent
i
please
on
the
populous
city
the
insect
is
small
less
than
half
the
size
of
muraria
but
no
matter
it
will
deserve
all
the
more
credit
if
it
can
traverse
the
two
miles
and
a
half
in
store
for
it
and
find
its
way
back
to
the
nest
i
take
forty
bees
isolating
them
as
usual
in
screws
of
paper
in
order
to
reach
the
nest
i
place
a
ladder
against
the
wall
it
will
be
used
by
my
daughter
aglae
and
will
enable
her
to
mark
the
exact
moment
of
the
return
of
the
first
bee
i
set
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
my
watch
at
the
same
time
so
that
we
may
compare
the
instant
of
departure
and
of
arrival
things
being
thus
arranged
i
carry
off
my
forty
captives
and
go
to
the
identical
spot
where
muraria
works
in
the
pebbly
bed
of
the
aygues
the
trip
will
have
a
double
object
to
observe
reaumur
mason
and
to
set
the
sicilian
mason
at
liberty
the
latter
therefore
will
also
have
two
and
a
half
miles
to
travel
home
at
last
my
prisoners
are
released
all
of
them
being
first
marked
with
a
big
white
dot
in
the
middle
of
the
thorax
you
do
not
come
off
when
handling
one
after
the
other
forty
wrathful
bees
who
promptly
unsheathe
and
brandish
their
poisoned
stings
the
stab
is
but
too
often
given
before
the
mark
is
made
my
smarting
fingers
make
movements
of
which
my
will
is
not
always
able
to
control
i
take
hold
with
greater
precaution
for
myself
than
for
the
insect
i
sometimes
squeeze
harder
than
i
ought
to
if
i
am
to
spare
my
travellers
to
experiment
so
as
to
lift
if
possible
a
tiny
corner
of
the
veil
of
truth
is
a
fine
and
noble
thing
a
mighty
stimulant
in
the
face
of
danger
but
still
one
may
be
excused
for
displaying
some
impatience
when
it
is
a
matter
of
receiving
forty
stings
in
one
fingers
at
one
short
sitting
if
any
man
should
reproach
me
for
being
too
careless
with
my
thumbs
i
would
suggest
that
he
should
have
a
try
he
can
then
judge
for
himself
the
pleasures
of
the
situation
to
cut
a
long
story
short
either
through
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
or
through
my
fingers
pressing
too
hard
and
perhaps
injuring
some
articulations
only
twenty
out
of
my
forty
bees
start
with
a
bold
vigorous
flight
the
others
unable
to
keep
their
balance
wander
about
on
the
nearest
bit
of
grass
or
remain
on
the
on
which
i
have
placed
them
refusing
to
fly
even
when
i
tickle
them
with
a
straw
these
weaklings
these
cripples
these
incapables
injured
by
my
fingers
must
be
struck
off
my
list
those
who
started
with
an
unhesitating
flight
number
about
twenty
that
is
ample
at
the
actual
moment
of
departure
there
is
nothing
definite
about
the
direction
taken
none
of
that
straight
flight
to
the
nest
which
the
once
showed
me
in
similar
circumstances
as
soon
as
they
are
liberated
the
flee
as
though
scared
some
in
one
direction
some
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
nevertheless
as
far
as
their
impetuous
flight
allows
i
seem
to
perceive
a
quick
return
on
the
part
of
those
bees
who
have
started
flying
towards
a
point
opposite
to
their
home
and
the
majority
appear
to
me
to
be
making
for
those
blue
distances
where
their
nest
lies
i
leave
this
question
with
certain
doubts
which
are
inevitable
in
the
case
of
insects
which
i
can
not
follow
with
my
eyes
for
more
than
twenty
yards
hitherto
the
operation
has
been
favoured
by
calm
weather
but
now
things
become
complicated
the
heat
is
stifling
and
the
sky
becomes
stormy
a
stiff
breeze
springs
up
blowing
from
the
south
the
very
direction
which
my
bees
must
take
to
return
to
the
nest
can
they
overcome
this
opposing
current
and
cleave
the
aerial
torrent
with
their
wings
if
they
try
they
will
have
to
fly
close
to
the
ground
as
i
now
see
the
bees
do
who
continue
their
foraging
but
soaring
to
lofty
regions
whence
they
can
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
country
is
so
it
seems
to
me
prohibited
i
am
therefore
very
apprehensive
as
to
the
success
of
my
experiment
when
i
return
to
orange
after
first
trying
to
steal
some
fresh
secret
from
the
aygues
of
the
pebbles
i
have
scarcely
reached
the
house
before
aglae
greets
me
her
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
she
cries
came
back
at
twenty
minutes
to
three
with
a
load
of
pollen
under
their
bellies
a
friend
of
mine
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
a
grave
man
of
the
law
who
on
hearing
what
was
happening
had
neglected
code
and
stamped
paper
and
insisted
upon
also
being
present
at
the
arrival
of
my
the
result
interested
him
more
than
his
case
about
a
under
a
tropical
sun
in
a
furnace
heat
reflected
from
the
wall
of
the
shed
every
five
minutes
he
climbed
the
ladder
with
no
other
protection
against
sunstroke
than
his
thatch
of
thick
grey
locks
instead
of
the
one
observer
whom
i
had
posted
i
found
two
good
pairs
of
eyes
watching
the
bees
return
i
had
released
my
insects
at
about
two
and
the
first
arrivals
returned
to
the
nest
at
twenty
minutes
to
three
they
had
therefore
taken
less
than
of
an
hour
to
cover
the
two
miles
and
a
half
a
very
striking
result
especially
when
we
remember
that
the
bees
did
some
foraging
on
the
road
as
was
proved
by
the
yellow
pollen
on
their
bellies
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
travellers
flight
must
have
been
hindered
by
the
wind
blowing
against
them
three
more
came
home
before
my
eyes
each
with
her
load
of
pollen
an
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
work
done
on
the
journey
as
it
was
growing
late
our
observations
had
to
cease
when
the
sun
goes
down
the
leave
the
nest
and
take
refuge
somewhere
or
other
perhaps
under
the
tiles
of
the
roofs
or
in
little
corners
of
the
walls
i
could
not
reckon
on
the
arrival
of
the
others
before
work
was
resumed
in
the
full
sunshine
next
day
when
the
sun
recalled
the
scattered
workers
to
the
nest
i
took
a
fresh
census
of
bees
with
a
white
spot
on
the
thorax
my
success
exceeded
all
my
hopes
i
counted
fifteen
fifteen
of
the
transported
prisoners
of
the
day
before
storing
their
cells
or
building
as
though
nothing
out
of
the
way
had
happened
the
weather
had
become
more
and
more
threatening
and
now
the
storm
burst
and
was
followed
by
a
succession
of
rainy
days
which
prevented
me
from
continuing
the
experiment
suffices
as
it
stands
of
some
twenty
bees
who
had
seemed
fit
to
make
the
long
journey
when
i
released
them
fifteen
at
least
had
returned
two
within
the
first
hour
three
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
the
rest
next
morning
they
had
returned
in
spite
of
having
the
wind
against
them
and
a
graver
difficulty
still
in
spite
of
being
unacquainted
with
the
locality
to
which
i
had
transported
them
there
is
in
fact
no
doubt
that
they
were
setting
eyes
for
the
first
time
on
those
of
the
aygues
which
i
had
selected
as
the
never
would
they
have
travelled
so
far
afield
of
their
own
accord
for
everything
that
they
want
for
building
and
victualling
under
the
roof
of
my
shed
is
within
easy
reach
the
path
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
supplies
the
mortar
the
flowery
meadows
surrounding
my
house
furnish
nectar
and
pollen
economical
of
their
time
as
they
are
they
do
not
go
flying
two
miles
and
a
half
in
search
of
what
abounds
at
a
few
yards
from
the
nest
besides
i
see
them
daily
taking
their
from
the
path
and
gathering
their
harvest
on
the
especially
on
the
meadow
sage
to
all
appearance
their
expeditions
do
not
cover
more
than
a
radius
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
then
how
did
my
exiles
return
what
guided
them
it
was
certainly
not
memory
but
some
special
faculty
which
we
must
content
ourselves
with
recognizing
by
its
astonishing
effects
without
pretending
to
explain
it
so
greatly
does
it
transcend
our
own
psychology
chapter
exchanging
the
nests
let
us
continue
our
series
of
tests
with
the
of
the
walls
thanks
to
its
position
on
a
pebble
which
we
can
move
at
will
the
nest
of
this
bee
lends
itself
to
most
interesting
experiments
here
is
the
first
i
shift
a
nest
from
its
place
that
is
to
say
i
carry
the
pebble
which
serves
as
its
support
to
a
spot
two
yards
away
as
the
edifice
and
its
base
form
but
one
the
removal
is
performed
without
the
smallest
disturbance
of
the
cells
i
lay
the
boulder
in
an
exposed
place
where
it
is
well
in
view
as
it
was
on
its
original
site
the
bee
returning
from
her
harvest
can
not
fail
to
see
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
owner
arrives
and
goes
straight
to
where
the
nest
stood
she
hovers
gracefully
over
the
vacant
site
examines
and
alights
upon
the
exact
spot
where
the
stone
used
to
lie
here
she
walks
about
for
a
long
time
making
persistent
searches
then
the
bee
takes
wing
and
flies
away
to
some
distance
her
absence
is
of
short
duration
here
she
is
back
again
the
search
is
resumed
walking
and
flying
and
always
on
the
site
which
the
nest
occupied
at
first
a
fresh
fit
of
exasperation
that
is
to
say
an
abrupt
flight
across
the
is
followed
by
a
fresh
return
and
a
renewal
of
the
vain
search
always
upon
the
mark
left
by
the
shifted
pebble
these
sudden
departures
these
prompt
returns
these
persevering
inspections
of
the
deserted
spot
continue
for
a
long
time
a
very
long
time
before
the
mason
is
convinced
that
her
nest
is
gone
she
has
certainly
seen
it
has
seen
it
over
and
over
again
in
its
new
position
for
sometimes
she
has
flown
only
a
few
inches
above
it
but
she
takes
no
notice
of
it
to
her
it
is
not
her
nest
but
the
property
of
another
bee
often
the
experiment
ends
without
so
much
as
a
single
visit
to
the
boulder
which
i
have
moved
two
or
three
yards
away
the
bee
goes
off
and
does
not
return
if
the
distance
be
less
a
yard
for
instance
the
mason
sooner
or
later
alights
on
the
stone
which
supports
her
abode
she
inspects
the
cell
which
she
was
building
or
provisioning
a
little
while
before
repeatedly
dips
her
head
into
it
examines
the
surface
of
the
pebble
step
by
step
and
after
long
hesitations
goes
and
resumes
her
search
on
the
site
where
the
home
ought
to
be
the
nest
that
is
no
longer
in
its
natural
place
is
definitely
abandoned
even
though
it
be
but
a
yard
away
from
the
original
spot
vainly
does
the
bee
settle
on
it
time
after
time
she
can
not
recognize
it
as
hers
i
was
convinced
of
this
on
finding
it
several
days
after
the
experiment
in
just
the
same
condition
as
when
i
moved
it
the
open
cell
with
honey
was
still
open
and
was
surrendering
its
contents
to
the
pillaging
ants
the
cell
that
was
building
had
remained
unfinished
with
not
a
single
layer
added
to
it
the
bee
obviously
may
have
returned
to
it
but
she
had
not
resumed
work
upon
it
the
transplanted
dwelling
was
abandoned
for
good
and
all
i
will
not
deduce
the
strange
paradox
that
the
though
capable
of
finding
her
nest
from
the
verge
of
the
horizon
is
incapable
of
finding
it
at
a
yard
distance
i
interpret
the
occurrence
as
meaning
something
quite
different
the
proper
inference
appears
to
me
to
be
this
the
bee
retains
a
rooted
impression
of
the
site
occupied
by
the
nest
and
returns
to
it
with
unwearying
persistence
even
when
the
nest
is
gone
but
she
has
only
a
very
vague
notion
of
the
nest
itself
she
does
not
recognize
the
masonry
which
she
herself
has
erected
and
kneaded
with
her
saliva
she
does
not
know
the
which
she
herself
has
stored
in
vain
she
inspects
her
cell
her
own
handiwork
she
abandons
it
refusing
to
acknowledge
it
as
hers
once
the
spot
whereon
the
pebble
rests
is
changed
insect
memory
it
must
be
confessed
is
a
strange
one
displaying
such
lucidity
in
its
general
acquaintance
with
locality
and
such
limitations
in
its
knowledge
of
the
dwelling
i
feel
inclined
to
call
it
topographical
instinct
it
grasps
the
map
of
the
country
and
not
the
beloved
nest
the
home
itself
the
cf
insect
life
chapters
to
translator
note
have
already
led
us
to
a
like
conclusion
when
the
nest
is
laid
open
these
wasps
become
wholly
indifferent
to
the
family
to
the
grub
writhing
in
agony
in
the
sun
they
do
not
recognize
it
what
they
do
recognize
what
they
seek
and
find
with
marvellous
precision
is
the
site
of
the
of
which
nothing
at
all
is
left
not
even
the
threshold
if
any
doubts
remained
as
to
the
incapacity
of
the
of
the
walls
to
know
her
nest
other
than
by
the
place
which
the
pebble
occupies
on
the
ground
here
is
something
to
remove
them
for
the
nest
of
one
i
substitute
that
of
another
resembling
it
as
closely
as
possible
in
respect
to
both
masonry
and
storage
this
exchange
and
those
of
which
i
shall
speak
presently
are
of
course
made
in
the
absence
the
bee
settles
without
hesitation
in
this
nest
which
is
not
hers
but
which
stands
where
the
other
did
if
she
was
building
i
offer
her
a
cell
in
process
of
building
she
continues
the
masonry
with
the
same
care
and
the
same
zeal
as
if
the
work
already
done
were
her
own
work
if
she
was
fetching
honey
and
pollen
i
offer
her
a
cell
she
continues
her
journeys
with
honey
in
her
crop
and
pollen
under
her
belly
to
finish
filling
another
warehouse
the
bee
therefore
does
not
suspect
the
exchange
she
does
not
distinguish
between
what
is
her
property
and
what
is
not
she
imagines
that
she
is
still
working
at
the
cell
which
is
really
hers
after
leaving
her
for
a
time
in
possession
of
the
strange
nest
i
give
her
back
her
own
this
fresh
change
passes
unperceived
by
the
bee
the
work
is
continued
in
the
cell
restored
to
her
at
the
point
which
it
had
reached
in
the
substituted
cell
i
once
more
replace
it
by
the
strange
nest
and
again
the
insect
persists
in
continuing
its
labour
by
thus
constantly
interchanging
the
strange
nest
and
the
proper
nest
without
altering
the
actual
site
i
thoroughly
convinced
myself
of
the
inability
to
discriminate
between
what
is
her
work
and
what
is
not
whether
the
cell
belong
to
her
or
to
another
she
labours
at
it
with
equal
zest
so
long
as
the
basis
of
the
edifice
the
pebble
continues
to
occupy
its
original
position
the
experiment
receives
an
added
interest
if
we
employ
two
neighbouring
nests
the
work
on
which
is
about
equally
advanced
i
move
each
to
where
the
other
stood
they
are
not
much
more
than
thirty
inches
a
part
in
spite
of
their
being
so
near
to
each
other
that
it
is
quite
possible
for
the
insects
to
see
both
homes
at
once
and
choose
between
them
each
bee
on
arriving
settles
immediately
on
the
substituted
nest
and
continues
her
work
there
change
the
two
nests
as
often
as
you
please
and
you
shall
see
the
two
keep
to
the
site
which
they
selected
and
labour
in
turn
now
at
their
own
cell
and
now
at
the
other
one
might
think
that
the
cause
of
this
confusion
lies
in
a
close
resemblance
between
the
two
nests
for
at
the
start
little
expecting
the
results
which
i
was
to
obtain
i
used
to
choose
the
nests
which
i
interchanged
as
much
alike
as
possible
for
fear
of
disheartening
the
bees
i
need
not
have
taken
this
precaution
i
was
giving
the
insect
credit
for
a
perspicacity
which
it
does
not
possess
indeed
i
now
take
two
nests
which
are
extremely
unlike
each
other
the
only
point
of
resemblance
being
that
in
each
case
the
toiler
finds
a
cell
in
which
she
can
continue
the
work
which
she
is
actually
doing
the
first
is
an
old
nest
whose
dome
is
perforated
with
eight
holes
the
apertures
of
the
cells
of
the
previous
generation
one
of
these
cells
has
been
repaired
and
the
bee
is
busy
storing
it
the
second
is
a
nest
of
recent
construction
which
has
not
received
its
mortar
dome
and
consists
of
a
single
cell
with
its
stucco
covering
here
too
the
insect
is
busy
hoarding
no
two
nests
could
present
greater
differences
one
with
its
eight
empty
chambers
and
its
spreading
clay
dome
the
other
with
its
single
bare
cell
at
most
the
size
of
an
acorn
well
the
two
do
not
hesitate
long
in
front
of
these
exchanged
nests
not
three
feet
away
from
each
other
each
makes
for
the
site
of
her
late
home
one
the
original
owner
of
the
old
nest
finds
nothing
but
a
solitary
cell
she
rapidly
inspects
the
pebble
and
without
further
formalities
first
plunges
her
head
into
the
strange
cell
to
disgorge
honey
and
then
her
abdomen
to
deposit
pollen
and
this
is
not
an
action
due
to
the
imperative
need
of
ridding
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
no
matter
where
of
an
irksome
load
for
the
bee
flies
off
and
soon
comes
back
again
with
a
fresh
supply
of
provender
which
she
stores
away
carefully
this
carrying
of
provisions
to
another
larder
is
repeated
as
often
as
i
permit
it
the
other
bee
finding
instead
of
her
one
cell
a
roomy
structure
consisting
of
eight
apartments
is
at
first
not
a
little
embarrassed
which
of
the
eight
cells
is
the
right
one
in
which
is
the
heap
of
paste
on
which
she
had
begun
the
bee
therefore
visits
the
chambers
one
by
one
dives
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
ends
by
finding
what
she
seeks
that
is
to
say
what
was
in
her
nest
when
she
started
on
her
last
journey
the
nucleus
of
a
store
of
food
thenceforward
she
behaves
like
her
neighbour
and
goes
on
carrying
honey
and
pollen
to
the
warehouse
which
is
not
of
her
constructing
restore
the
nests
to
their
original
places
exchange
them
yet
once
again
and
both
bees
after
a
short
hesitation
which
the
great
difference
between
the
two
nests
is
enough
to
explain
will
pursue
the
work
in
the
cell
of
her
own
making
and
in
the
strange
cell
alternately
at
last
the
egg
is
laid
and
the
sanctuary
closed
no
matter
what
nest
happens
to
be
occupied
at
the
moment
when
the
provisioning
reaches
completion
these
incidents
are
sufficient
to
show
why
i
hesitate
to
give
the
name
of
memory
to
the
singular
faculty
that
brings
the
insect
back
to
her
nest
with
such
unerring
precision
and
yet
does
not
allow
her
to
distinguish
her
work
from
some
one
else
however
great
the
difference
may
be
we
will
now
experiment
with
chalicodoma
muraria
from
another
psychological
point
of
view
here
is
a
building
she
is
at
work
on
the
first
course
of
her
cell
i
give
her
in
exchange
a
cell
not
only
finished
as
a
structure
but
also
filled
nearly
to
the
top
with
honey
i
have
just
stolen
it
from
its
owner
who
would
not
have
been
long
before
laying
her
egg
in
it
what
will
the
mason
do
in
the
presence
of
this
munificent
gift
which
saves
her
the
trouble
of
building
and
harvesting
she
will
leave
the
mortar
no
doubt
finish
storing
the
lay
her
egg
and
seal
up
a
mistake
an
utter
mistake
our
logic
is
not
the
logic
of
the
insect
which
obeys
an
inevitable
unconscious
prompting
it
has
no
choice
as
to
what
it
shall
do
it
can
not
discriminate
between
what
is
and
what
is
not
advisable
it
glides
as
it
were
down
an
irresistible
slope
prepared
beforehand
to
bring
it
to
a
definite
end
this
is
what
the
facts
that
still
remain
to
be
stated
proclaim
with
no
uncertain
voice
the
bee
who
was
building
and
to
whom
i
offer
a
cell
and
full
of
honey
does
not
lay
aside
her
mortar
for
that
she
was
doing
work
and
once
on
that
tack
guided
by
the
unconscious
impulse
she
has
to
keep
masoning
even
though
her
labour
be
useless
superfluous
and
opposed
to
her
interests
the
cell
which
i
give
her
is
certainly
perfect
looked
upon
as
a
building
in
the
opinion
of
the
herself
since
the
bee
from
whom
i
took
it
was
completing
the
provision
of
honey
to
touch
it
up
especially
to
add
to
it
is
useless
and
what
is
more
absurd
no
matter
the
bee
who
was
masoning
will
mason
on
the
aperture
of
the
she
lays
a
first
course
of
mortar
followed
by
another
and
yet
another
until
at
last
the
cell
is
a
third
taller
then
the
regulation
height
the
is
now
done
not
as
perfectly
it
is
true
as
if
the
bee
had
gone
on
with
the
cell
whose
foundations
she
was
laying
at
the
moment
when
i
exchanged
the
nests
but
still
to
an
extent
which
is
more
than
enough
to
prove
the
overpowering
impulse
which
the
builder
obeys
next
comes
the
victualling
which
is
also
cut
short
lest
the
swelled
by
the
joint
contributions
of
the
two
bees
should
overflow
thus
the
who
is
beginning
to
build
and
to
whom
we
give
a
complete
cell
a
cell
filled
with
honey
makes
no
change
in
the
order
of
her
work
she
builds
first
and
then
victuals
only
she
shortens
her
work
her
instinct
warning
her
that
the
height
of
the
cell
and
the
quantity
of
honey
are
beginning
to
assume
extravagant
proportions
the
converse
is
equally
conclusive
to
a
engaged
in
victualling
i
give
a
nest
with
a
cell
only
just
begun
and
not
at
all
fit
to
receive
the
paste
this
cell
with
its
last
course
still
wet
with
its
builder
saliva
may
or
may
not
be
accompanied
by
other
cells
recently
closed
up
each
with
its
honey
and
its
egg
the
bee
finding
this
in
the
place
of
her
is
greatly
perplexed
what
to
do
when
she
comes
with
her
harvest
to
this
unfinished
shallow
cup
in
which
there
is
no
place
to
put
the
honey
she
inspects
it
measures
it
with
her
eyes
tries
it
with
her
antennae
and
recognizes
its
insufficient
capacity
she
hesitates
for
a
long
time
goes
away
comes
back
flies
away
again
and
soon
returns
eager
to
deposit
her
treasure
the
insect
embarrassment
is
most
evident
and
i
can
not
help
saying
inwardly
some
mortar
get
some
mortar
and
finish
making
the
warehouse
it
will
only
take
you
a
few
moments
and
you
will
have
a
cupboard
of
the
right
depth
the
bee
thinks
differently
she
was
storing
her
cell
and
she
must
go
on
storing
come
what
may
never
will
she
bring
herself
to
lay
aside
the
for
the
trowel
never
will
she
suspend
the
foraging
which
is
occupying
her
at
this
moment
to
begin
the
work
of
construction
which
is
not
yet
due
she
will
rather
go
in
search
of
a
strange
cell
in
the
desired
condition
and
slip
in
there
to
deposit
her
honey
at
the
risk
of
meeting
with
a
warm
reception
from
the
irate
owner
she
goes
off
in
fact
to
try
her
luck
i
wish
her
success
being
myself
the
cause
of
this
desperate
act
my
curiosity
has
turned
an
honest
worker
into
a
robber
things
may
take
a
still
more
serious
turn
so
invincible
so
imperious
is
the
desire
to
have
the
booty
stored
in
a
safe
place
without
delay
the
uncompleted
cell
which
the
bee
refuses
to
accept
instead
of
her
own
finished
warehouse
with
honey
is
often
as
i
said
accompanied
by
other
cells
not
long
closed
each
containing
its
and
its
egg
in
this
case
i
have
sometimes
though
not
always
witnessed
the
following
when
once
the
bee
realises
the
shortcomings
of
the
unfinished
nest
she
begins
to
gnaw
the
clay
lid
closing
one
of
the
adjoining
cells
she
softens
a
part
of
the
mortar
cover
with
saliva
and
patiently
atom
by
atom
digs
through
the
hard
wall
it
is
very
slow
work
a
good
elapses
before
the
tiny
cavity
is
large
enough
to
admit
a
pin
head
i
wait
longer
still
then
i
lose
patience
and
fully
convinced
that
the
bee
is
trying
to
open
the
i
decide
to
help
her
to
shorten
the
work
the
upper
part
of
the
cell
comes
away
with
it
leaving
the
edges
badly
broken
in
my
awkwardness
i
have
turned
an
elegant
vase
into
a
wretched
cracked
pot
i
was
right
in
my
conjecture
the
bee
intention
was
to
break
open
the
door
straight
away
without
heeding
the
raggedness
of
the
orifice
she
settles
down
in
the
cell
which
i
have
opened
for
her
time
after
time
she
fetches
honey
and
pollen
though
the
larder
is
already
fully
stocked
lastly
she
lays
her
egg
in
this
cell
which
already
contains
an
egg
that
is
not
hers
having
done
which
she
closes
the
broken
aperture
to
the
best
of
her
ability
so
this
purveyor
had
neither
the
knowledge
nor
the
power
to
bow
to
the
inevitable
i
had
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
go
on
with
her
purveying
unless
she
first
completed
the
unfinished
cell
substituted
for
her
own
but
she
did
not
retreat
before
that
impossible
task
she
accomplished
her
work
but
in
the
absurdest
way
by
injuriously
trespassing
upon
another
property
by
continuing
to
store
provisions
in
a
cupboard
already
full
to
overflowing
by
laying
her
egg
in
a
cell
in
which
the
real
owner
had
already
laid
and
lastly
by
hurriedly
closing
an
orifice
that
called
for
serious
repairs
what
better
proof
could
be
wished
of
the
irresistible
propensity
which
the
insect
obeys
lastly
there
are
certain
swift
and
consecutive
actions
so
closely
interlinked
that
the
performance
of
the
second
demands
a
previous
repetition
of
the
first
even
when
this
action
has
become
useless
i
have
already
described
how
the
sphex
cf
insect
life
chapters
to
translator
note
persists
in
descending
into
her
burrow
alone
after
depositing
at
its
edge
the
cricket
whom
i
maliciously
at
once
remove
her
repeated
discomfitures
do
not
make
her
abandon
the
preliminary
inspection
of
the
home
an
inspection
which
becomes
quite
useless
when
renewed
for
the
tenth
or
twentieth
time
the
of
the
walls
shows
us
under
another
form
a
similar
repetition
of
an
act
which
is
useless
in
itself
but
which
is
the
compulsory
preface
to
the
act
that
follows
when
arriving
with
her
provisions
the
bee
performs
a
twofold
operation
of
storing
first
she
dives
head
foremost
into
the
cell
to
disgorge
the
contents
of
her
crop
next
she
comes
out
and
at
once
goes
in
again
backwards
to
brush
her
abdomen
and
rub
off
the
load
of
pollen
at
the
moment
when
the
insect
is
about
to
enter
the
cell
tail
first
i
push
her
aside
gently
with
a
straw
the
second
act
is
thus
prevented
the
bee
now
begins
the
whole
performance
over
again
that
is
to
say
she
once
more
dives
head
first
to
the
bottom
of
the
cell
though
she
has
nothing
left
to
disgorge
as
her
crop
has
just
been
emptied
when
this
is
done
it
is
the
turn
i
instantly
push
her
aside
again
the
insect
repeats
its
proceedings
still
entering
head
first
i
also
repeat
my
touch
of
the
straw
and
this
can
go
on
as
long
as
the
observer
pleases
pushed
aside
at
the
moment
when
she
is
about
to
insert
her
abdomen
into
the
cell
the
bee
goes
back
to
the
opening
and
persists
in
going
down
head
first
to
begin
with
sometimes
she
descends
to
the
bottom
sometimes
only
sometimes
again
she
only
pretends
to
descend
just
bending
her
head
into
the
aperture
but
whether
completed
or
not
this
action
for
which
there
is
no
longer
any
motive
since
the
honey
has
already
been
disgorged
invariably
precedes
the
entrance
backwards
to
deposit
the
pollen
it
is
almost
the
movement
of
a
machine
whose
works
are
only
set
going
when
the
begins
to
revolve
chapter
more
enquiries
into
this
chapter
was
to
have
taken
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed
to
charles
darwin
the
illustrious
naturalist
who
now
lies
buried
beside
newton
in
westminster
abbey
it
was
my
task
to
report
to
him
the
result
of
some
experiments
which
he
had
suggested
to
me
in
the
course
of
our
correspondence
a
very
pleasant
task
for
though
facts
as
i
see
them
disincline
me
to
accept
his
theories
i
have
none
the
less
the
deepest
veneration
for
his
noble
character
and
his
scientific
honesty
i
was
drafting
my
letter
when
the
sad
news
reached
me
darwin
was
dead
after
searching
the
mighty
question
of
origins
he
was
now
grappling
with
the
last
and
darkest
problem
of
the
hereafter
darwin
died
at
down
in
kent
on
the
of
april
translator
note
i
therefore
abandon
the
epistolary
form
which
would
be
unwarranted
in
view
of
that
grave
at
westminster
a
free
and
impersonal
statement
shall
set
forth
what
i
intended
to
relate
in
a
more
academic
manner
one
thing
above
all
had
struck
the
english
scientist
on
reading
the
first
volume
of
my
souvenirs
entomologiques
namely
the
faculty
of
knowing
the
way
back
to
their
nests
after
being
carried
to
great
distances
from
home
what
sort
of
compass
do
they
employ
on
their
return
journeys
what
sense
guides
them
the
profound
observer
thereupon
spoke
of
an
experiment
which
he
had
always
longed
to
make
with
pigeons
and
which
he
had
always
neglected
making
absorbed
as
he
was
by
other
interests
this
experiment
he
thought
i
might
attempt
with
my
bees
substitute
the
insect
for
the
bird
and
the
problem
remained
the
same
i
quote
from
his
letter
the
passage
referring
to
the
trial
which
he
wished
made
me
to
make
a
suggestion
in
relation
to
your
wonderful
account
of
insects
finding
their
way
home
i
formerly
wished
to
try
it
with
pigeons
namely
to
carry
the
insects
in
their
paper
cornets
about
a
hundred
paces
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
you
intended
ultimately
to
carry
them
but
before
turning
round
to
return
to
put
the
insects
in
a
circular
box
with
an
axle
which
could
be
made
to
revolve
very
rapidly
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
so
as
to
destroy
for
a
time
all
sense
of
direction
in
the
insects
i
have
sometimes
imagined
that
animals
may
feel
in
which
direction
they
were
at
the
first
start
carried
this
method
of
experimenting
seemed
to
me
very
ingeniously
conceived
before
going
west
i
walk
eastwards
in
the
darkness
of
their
paper
bags
the
mere
fact
that
i
am
moving
them
gives
my
prisoners
a
sense
of
the
direction
in
which
i
am
taking
them
if
nothing
happened
to
disturb
this
first
impression
the
insect
would
be
guided
by
it
in
returning
this
would
explain
the
homing
of
my
carried
to
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
amid
strange
surroundings
but
when
the
insects
have
been
sufficiently
impressed
by
their
conveyance
to
the
east
there
comes
the
rapid
twirl
first
this
way
round
then
that
bewildered
by
all
these
revolutions
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
the
insect
does
not
know
that
i
have
turned
round
and
remains
under
its
original
impression
i
am
now
taking
it
to
the
west
when
it
believes
itself
to
be
still
travelling
towards
the
east
under
the
influence
of
this
impression
the
insect
is
bound
to
lose
its
bearings
when
set
free
it
will
fly
in
the
opposite
direction
to
its
home
which
it
will
never
find
again
this
result
seemed
to
me
the
more
probable
inasmuch
as
the
statements
of
the
around
me
were
all
of
a
nature
to
confirm
my
hopes
favier

author

chapter
translator
note
the
very
man
for
this
sort
of
information
was
the
first
to
put
me
on
the
track
he
told
me
that
when
people
want
to
move
a
cat
from
one
farm
to
another
at
some
distance
they
place
the
animal
in
a
bag
which
they
twirl
rapidly
at
the
moment
of
starting
thus
preventing
the
animal
from
returning
to
the
house
which
it
has
quitted
many
others
besides
favier
described
the
same
practice
to
me
according
to
them
this
twirling
round
in
a
bag
was
an
infallible
expedient
the
bewildered
cat
never
returned
i
communicated
what
i
had
learnt
to
england
i
wrote
to
the
sage
of
down
and
told
him
how
the
peasant
had
anticipated
the
researches
of
science
charles
darwin
was
amazed
so
was
i
and
we
both
of
us
almost
reckoned
on
a
success
these
preliminaries
took
place
in
the
winter
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
prepare
for
the
experiment
which
was
to
be
made
in
the
following
may
i
said
one
day
to
my
assistant
shall
want
some
of
those
nests
go
and
ask
our
neighbour
leave
and
climb
to
the
roof
of
his
shed
with
some
new
tiles
and
some
mortar
which
you
can
fetch
from
the
builder
take
a
dozen
tiles
from
the
roof
those
with
the
biggest
nests
on
them
and
put
the
new
ones
in
their
place
things
were
done
accordingly
my
neighbour
assented
with
a
good
grace
to
the
exchange
of
tiles
for
he
himself
is
obliged
from
time
to
time
to
demolish
the
work
of
the
unless
he
would
risk
seeing
his
roof
fall
in
sooner
or
later
i
was
merely
forestalling
a
repair
which
became
more
urgent
every
year
that
same
evening
i
was
in
possession
of
twelve
magnificent
rectangular
blocks
of
nest
each
lying
on
the
convex
surface
of
a
tile
that
is
to
say
on
the
surface
looking
towards
the
inside
of
the
shed
i
had
the
curiosity
to
weigh
the
largest
it
turned
the
scale
at
pounds
now
the
roof
whence
it
came
was
covered
with
similar
masses
adjoining
one
another
over
a
stretch
of
some
seventy
tiles
reckoning
only
half
the
weight
so
as
to
strike
an
average
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
lumps
we
find
the
total
weight
of
the
bee
masonry
to
amount
to
of
a
ton
and
even
so
people
tell
me
that
they
have
seen
this
beaten
elsewhere
leave
the
to
her
own
devices
in
the
spot
that
suits
her
allow
the
work
of
many
generations
to
accumulate
and
one
fine
day
the
roof
will
break
down
under
the
extra
burden
let
the
nests
grow
old
let
them
fall
to
pieces
when
the
damp
gets
into
them
and
you
will
have
chunks
tumbling
on
your
head
big
enough
to
crack
your
skull
there
you
see
the
work
of
a
very
insect
the
insect
is
so
little
known
that
i
made
a
serious
mistake
when
treating
of
it
in
the
first
volume
of
these
souvenirs
under
my
erroneous
denomination
of
chalicodoma
sicula
are
really
comprised
two
species
one
building
its
nests
in
our
dwellings
and
particularly
under
the
tiles
of
outhouses
the
other
building
its
nests
on
the
branches
of
shrubs
the
first
species
has
received
various
names
which
are
in
order
of
priority
chalicodoma
pyrenaica
lep
megachile
chalicodoma
pyrrhopeza
gerstacker
chalicodoma
rufitarsis
giraud
it
is
a
pity
that
the
name
occupying
the
first
place
should
lend
itself
to
misconception
i
hesitate
to
apply
the
epithet
of
pyrenean
to
an
insect
which
is
much
less
common
in
the
pyrenees
than
in
my
own
district
i
shall
call
it
the
chalicodoma
or
of
the
sheds
there
is
no
objection
to
the
use
of
this
name
in
a
book
where
the
reader
prefers
lucidity
to
the
tyranny
of
systematic
entomology
the
second
species
that
which
builds
its
nests
on
the
branches
is
chalicodoma
rufescens
perez
for
a
like
reason
i
shall
call
it
the
chalicodoma
of
the
shrubs
i
owe
these
corrections
to
the
kindness
of
professor
jean
perez
of
bordeaux
who
is
so
in
the
lore
of
wasps
and
author
note
these
treasures
were
insufficient
not
in
regard
to
quantity
but
in
regard
to
quality
for
the
main
object
which
i
had
in
view
they
came
from
the
nearest
house
separated
from
mine
by
a
little
field
planted
with
corn
and
i
had
reason
to
fear
that
the
insects
issuing
from
those
nests
might
be
hereditarily
influenced
by
their
ancestors
who
had
lived
in
the
shed
for
many
a
long
year
the
bee
when
carried
to
a
distance
would
perhaps
come
back
guided
by
the
inveterate
family
habit
she
would
find
the
shed
of
her
lineal
predecessors
and
thence
without
difficulty
reach
her
nest
as
it
is
the
fashion
nowadays
to
assign
a
prominent
part
to
these
hereditary
influences
i
must
eliminate
them
from
my
experiments
i
want
strange
bees
brought
from
afar
whose
return
to
the
place
of
their
birth
can
in
no
way
assist

favier
took
the
business
in
hand
he
had
discovered
on
the
banks
of
the
aygues
at
some
miles
from
the
village
a
deserted
hut
where
the
had
established
themselves
in
a
numerous
colony
he
proposed
to
take
the
wheelbarrow
in
which
to
move
the
blocks
of
cells
but
i
objected
the
jolting
of
the
vehicle
over
the
rough
paths
might
jeopardise
the
contents
of
the
cells
a
basket
carried
on
the
shoulder
was
deemed
safer
favier
took
a
man
to
help
him
and
set
out
the
expedition
provided
me
with
four
tiles
it
was
all
that
the
two
men
were
able
to
carry
between
them
and
even
then
i
had
to
stand

on
their
arrival
they
were

a

have

many
to

the

from
the

the
next
thing
is
to
place
my
tiles
i
want
to
have
them
under
my
eyes
in
a
position
where
i
can
watch
them
easily
and
save
myself
the
worries
of
earlier
days
going
up
and
down
ladders
standing
for
hours
at
a
stretch
on
a
narrow
rung
that
hurt
the
soles
of
my
feet
and
risking
sunstroke
up
against
a
scorching
wall
moreover
it
is
necessary
that
my
guests
should
feel
almost
as
much
at
home
with
me
as
where
they
come
from
i
must
make
life
pleasant
for
them
if
i
should
have
them
grow
attached
to
the
new
dwelling
and
i
happen
to
have
the
very
thing
for
them
under
the
leads
of
my
house
is
a
wide
arch
the
sides
of
which
get
the
sun
while
the
back
remains
in
the
shade
there
is
something
for
everybody
the
shade
for
me
the
sunlight
for
my
boarders
we
fasten
a
stout
hook
to
each
tile
and
hang
it
on
the

on
a

with
our

half
my

are
on
the
right
half
on
the

the
general
effect
is
rather
original
any
one
walking
in
and
seeing
my
show
for
the
first
time
begins
by
taking
it
for
a
display
of
smoked
provisions
gammons
of
some
outlandish
bacon
curing
in
the
sun
on
perceiving
his
mistake
he
falls
into
raptures
at
these
new
hives
of
mine
the
news
spreads
through
the
village
and
more
than
one
pokes
fun
at
it
they
look
upon
me
as
a
keeper
of
hybrid
bees
wonder
what
he
going
to
make
out
of
that
say
they
my
hives
are
in
full
swing
before
the
end
of
april
when
the
work
is
at
its
height
the
swarm
becomes
a
little
eddying
buzzing
cloud
the
arch
is
a
passage
it
leads
to
a
for
various
household
provisions
the
members
of
my
family
bully
me
at
first
for
establishing
this
dangerous
commonwealth
within
the
precincts
of
our
home
they
dare
not
go
to
fetch
things
they
would
have
to
pass
through
a
swarm
of
bees
and
then
look
out
for
stings
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
prove
once
and
for
all
that
the
danger
does
not
exist
that
mine
is
a
most
peaceable
bee
incapable
of
stinging
so
long
as
she
is
not
startled
i
bring
my
face
close
to
one
of
the
clay
nests
so
as
almost
to
touch
it
while
it
is
black
with
masons
at
work
i
let
my
fingers
wander
through
the
ranks
i
put
a
few
bees
on
my
hand
i
stand
in
the
thick
of
the
whirling
crowd
and
never
a
prick
do
i
receive
i
have
long
known
their
peaceful
character
time
was
when
i
used
to
share
the
common
fears
when
i
hesitated
before
venturing
into
a
swarm
of
anthophorae
or
chalicodomae
nowadays
i
have
quite
got
over
those
terrors
if
you
do
not
tease
the
insect
the
thought
of
hurting
you
will
never
occur
to
it
at
the
worst
a
single
specimen
prompted
by
curiosity
rather
than
anger
will
come
and
hover
in
front
of
your
face
examining
you
with
some
persistency
but
employing
a
buzz
as
her
only
threat
let
her
be
her
scrutiny
is
quite
friendly
after
a
few
demonstrations
my
household
were
reassured
all
old
and
young
moved
in
and
out
of
the
arch
as
though
there
were
nothing
unusual
about
it
my
bees
far
from
remaining
an
object
of
dread
became
an
object
of
diversion
every
one
took
pleasure
in
watching
the
progress
of
their
ingenious
work
i
was
careful
not
to
divulge
the
secret
to
strangers
if
any
one
coming
on
business
passed
outside
the
arch
while
i
was
standing
before
the
hanging
nests
some
such
brief
dialogue
as
the
following
would
take
place
they
know
you
that
why
they
do
sting
you
certainly
know
me
me
you
that
another
matter
whereupon
the
intruder
would
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
which
was
what
i
wanted
it
is
time
that
we
thought
of
experimenting
the
intended
for
the
journey
must
be
marked
with
a
sign
whereby
i
may
know
them
a
solution
of
gum
arabic
thickened
with
a
red
blue
or
some
other
shade
is
the
material
which
i
use
to
mark
my
travellers
the
variety
in
hue
will
save
me
from
confusing
the
subjects
of
my
different
experiments
when
making
my
former
investigations
i
used
to
mark
the
bees
at
the
place
where
i
set
them
free
for
this
operation
the
insects
had
to
be
held
in
the
fingers
one
after
the
other
and
i
was
thus
exposed
to
frequent
stings
which
smarted
all
the
more
for
being
constantly
repeated
the
consequence
was
that
i
was
not
always
quite
able
to
control
my
fingers
and
thumbs
to
the
great
detriment
of
my
travellers
for
i
could
easily
warp
their
and
thus
weaken
their
flight
it
was
worth
while
improving
the
method
of
operation
both
in
my
own
interest
and
in
that
of
the
insect
i
must
mark
the
bee
carry
her
to
a
distance
and
release
her
without
taking
her
in
my
fingers
without
once
touching
her
the
experiment
was
bound
to
gain
by
these
nice
precautions
i
will
describe
the
method
which
i
adopted
the
bee
is
so
much
engrossed
in
her
work
when
she
buries
her
abdomen
in
the
cell
and
rids
herself
of
her
load
of
pollen
or
when
she
is
building
that
it
is
easy
at
such
times
without
alarming
her
to
mark
the
upper
side
of
the
thorax
with
a
straw
dipped
in
the
coloured
glue
the
insect
is
not
disturbed
by
that
slight
touch
it
flies
off
it
returns
laden
with
mortar
or
pollen
you
allow
these
trips
to
be
repeated
until
the
mark
on
the
thorax
is
quite
dry
which
soon
happens
in
the
hot
sun
necessary
to
the
bee
labours
the
next
thing
is
to
catch
her
and
imprison
her
in
a
paper
bag
still
without
touching
her
nothing
could
be
easier
you
place
a
small
over
the
bee
engrossed
in
her
work
the
insect
on
leaving
rushes
into
it
and
is
thence
transferred
to
the
paper
bag
which
is
forthwith
closed
and
placed
in
the
tin
box
that
will
serve
as
a
conveyance
for
the
whole
party
when
releasing
the
bees
all
you
have
to
do
is
open
the
bags
the
whole
performance
is
thus
effected
without
once
giving
that
distressing
squeeze
of
the
fingers
another
question
remains
to
be
solved
before
we
go
further
what
shall
i
allow
for
this
census
of
the
bees
that
return
to
the
nest
let
me
explain
what
i
mean
the
dot
which
i
have
made
in
the
middle
of
the
thorax
with
a
touch
of
my
sticky
straw
is
not
very
permanent
it
merely
adheres
to
the
hairs
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
been
no
more
lasting
if
i
had
held
the
insect
in
my
fingers
now
the
bee
often
brushes
her
back
she
dusts
it
each
time
she
leaves
the
galleries
besides
she
is
always
rubbing
her
coat
against
the
walls
of
the
cell
which
she
has
to
enter
and
to
leave
each
time
that
she
brings
honey
a
so
smartly
dressed
at
the
start
at
the
end
of
her
work
is
in
rags
her
fur
is
all
worn
bare
and
as
tattered
as
a
mechanic
overall
furthermore
in
bad
weather
the
of
the
walls
spends
the
days
and
nights
in
one
of
the
cells
of
her
dome
suspended
head
downwards
the
of
the
sheds
as
long
as
there
are
vacant
galleries
does
very
nearly
the
same
she
takes
shelter
in
the
galleries
but
with
her
head
at
the
entrance
once
those
old
habitations
are
in
use
however
and
the
building
of
new
cells
begun
she
selects
another
retreat
in
the
harmas
the
piece
of
enclosed
waste
ground
on
which
the

studies
his

in
their
natural
state

chapter

note
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
are
stone
heaps
intended
for
building
the
surrounding
wall
this
is
where
my
chalicodomae
pass
the
night
piled
up
promiscuously
both
sexes
together
they
sleep
in
numerous
companies
in
crevices
between
two
stones
laid
closely
one
on
top
of
the
other
some
of
these
companies
number
as
many
as
a
couple
of
hundred
the
most
common
dormitory
is
a
narrow
groove
here
they
all
huddle
as
far
forward
as
possible
with
their
backs
in
the
groove
i
see
some
lying
flat
on
their
backs
like
people
asleep
should
bad
weather
come
on
should
the
sky
cloud
over
should
the
whistle
they
do
not
stir
out
with
all
these
things
to
take
into
consideration
i
can
not
expect
my
dot
on
the
bee
thorax
to
last
any
length
of
time
by
day
the
constant
brushing
and
the
rubbing
against
the
partitions
of
the
galleries
soon
wipe
it
off
at
night
things
are
worse
still
in
the
narrow
where
the
take
refuge
by
the
hundred
after
a
night
spent
in
the
crevice
between
two
stones
it
is
not
advisable
to
trust
to
the
mark
made
yesterday
therefore
the
counting
of
the
number
of
bees
that
return
to
the
nest
must
be
taken
in
hand
at
once
tomorrow
would
be
too
late
and
so
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
recognize
those
of
my
subjects
whose
dots
had
disappeared
during
the
night
i
will
take
into
account
only
the
bees
that
return
on
the
same
day
the
question
of
the
rotary
machine
remains
darwin
advised
me
to
use
a
circular
box
with
an
axle
and
a
handle
i
have
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
house
it
will
be
simpler
and
quite
as
effective
to
employ
the
method
of

his

him

in
so
as
to

during

lastly
the
box
shall
be

to

and
i
will
whirl
the
whole
thing
round
like

of

i

any

of

likely
to
make
my

lose
their

my

in

of

combined
with
circles
if
i
spin
on
my
heels
at
the

time
i
am
able
to
make
the
process
still
more
complicated
by
compelling
my

to
trace
every
known
curve
that
is
what
i
shall
do

slabs
of
clay
in
order
to
select
a

others

others
are
garnering
stores
when
the
mark
is
dry
i
catch
them
and
pack
them
as
i
have
described
i
first
carry
them
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
which
i
intend
to
take
a
path
skirting
my

favours
this
preliminary
manoeuvre
i
have
every
hope
of
being
alone
when
the
time
comes
to
make
play
with
my
sling
there
is
a
cross
at
the
end
i
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
here
i
swing
my
bees
in
every
direction
now
while
i
am
making
the
box
describe
inverse
circles
and
loops
while
i
am
pirouetting
on
my
heels
to
achieve
the
various
curves
up
comes
a
woman
from
the
village
and
stares
at
me
oh
how
she
stares
at
me
what
a
look
she
gives
me
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
acting
in
such
a
silly
way
people
talked
about
it
it
was
sheer
witchcraft
had
i
not
dug
up
a
dead
body
only
a
few
days
before
yes
i
had
been
to
a
prehistoric
i
had
taken
from
it
a
pair
of
venerable
tibias
a
set
of
funerary
vessels
and
a
few
shoulders
of
horse
placed
there
as
a
viaticum
for
the
great
journey
i
had
done
this
thing
and
people
knew
it
and
now
to
crown
all
the
man
of
evil
reputation
is
found
at
the
foot
of
a
cross
indulging
in
unhallowed
antics
no
matter
and
it
shows
no
small
courage
on
my
part
the
gyrations
are
duly
accomplished
in
the
presence
of
this
unexpected
witness
then
i
retrace
my
steps
and
walk
westward
of
serignan
i
take
the
paths
i
cut
across
country
so
as
if
possible
to
avoid
a
second
meeting
it
would
be
the
last
straw
if
i
were
seen
opening
my
paper
bags
and
letting
loose
my
insects
when
to
make
my
experiment
more
decisive
still
i
repeat
the
rotation
in
as
complicated
a
fashion
as
before
i
repeat
it
for
the
third
time
at
the
spot
chosen
for
the
release
i
am
at
the
end
of
a
plain
with
here
and
there
a
scanty
curtain
of
and
walking
at
a
good
pace
i
have
taken
thirty
minutes
to
cover
the
ground
in
a
straight
line
the
distance
therefore
is
roughly
two
miles
it
is
a
fine
day
under
a
clear
sky
with
a
very
light
breeze
blowing
from
the
north
i
sit
down
on
the
ground
facing
the
south
so
that
the
insects
may
be
free
to
take
either
the
direction
of
their
nest
or
the
opposite
one
i
let
them
loose
at
a
quarter
past
two
when
the
bags
are
opened
the
bees
for
the
most
part
circle
several
times
around
me
and
then
dart
off
impetuously
in
the
direction
of
serignan
as
far
as
i
can
judge
it
is
not
easy
to
watch
them
because
they
fly
off
suddenly
after
going
two
or
three
times
round
my
body
a
object
which
they
wish
apparently
to
reconnoitre
before
starting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
my
eldest
daughter
antonia
who
is
on
the
beside
the
nests
sees
the
first
traveller
arrive
on
my
return
in
the
course
of
the
evening
two
others
come
back
total
three
home
on
the
same
day
out
of
ten
scattered
abroad
i
resume
the
experiment
next
morning
i
mark
ten
with
red
which
will
enable
me
to
distinguish
them
from
those
who
returned
on
the
day
before
and
from
those
who
may
still
return
with
the
white
spot
uneffaced
the
same
precautions
the
same
rotations
the
same
localities
as
on
the
first
occasion
only
i
make
no
rotation
on
the
way
confining
myself
to
swinging
my
box
round
on
leaving
and
on
arriving
the
insects
are
released
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
i
preferred
the
forenoon
as
this
was
the
busiest
time
at
the
works
one
bee
was
seen
by
antonia
to
be
back
at
the
nest
by
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
supposing
her
to
be
the
first
let
loose
it
took
her
just
five
minutes
to
cover
the
distance
but
there
is
nothing
to
tell
me
that
it
is
not
another
in
which
case
she
needed
less
it
is
the
fastest
speed
that
i
have
succeeded
in
noting
i
myself
am
back
at
twelve
and
within
a
short
time
catch
three
others
i
see
no
more
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
total
four
home
out
of
ten
the
of
may
is
a
very
bright
calm
warm
day
weather
highly
propitious
for
my
experiments
i
take
fifty
chalicodomae
marked
with
blue
the
distance
to
be
travelled
remains
the
same
i
make
the
first
rotation
after
carrying
my
insects
a
few
hundred
steps
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
which
i
finally
take
in
addition
three
rotations
on
the
road
a
fifth
rotation
at
the
place
where
they
are
set
free
if
they
do
not
lose
their
bearings
this
time
it
will
not
be
for
lack
of
twisting
and
turning
i
begin
to
open
my
screws
of
paper
at
twenty
minutes
past
nine
it
is
rather
early
for
which
reason
my
bees
on
recovering
their
liberty
remain
for
a
moment
undecided
and
lazy
but
after
a
short
sunbath
on
a
stone
where
i
place
them
they
take
wing
i
am
sitting
on
the
ground
facing
the
south
with
serignan
on
my
left
and
piolenc
on
my
right
when
the
flight
is
not
too
swift
to
allow
me
to
perceive
the
direction
taken
i
see
my
released
captives
disappear
to
my
left
a
few
but
only
a
few
go
south
two
or
three
go
west
or
to
right
of
me
i
do
not
speak
of
the
north
against
which
i
act
as
a
screen
all
told
the
great
majority
take
the
left
that
is
to
say
the
direction
of
the
nest
the
last
is
released
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
one
of
the
fifty
travellers
has
lost
her
mark
in
the
paper
bag
i
deduct
her
from
the
total
leaving
according
to
antonia
who
watches
the
the
earliest
arrivals
appeared
at
minutes
to
ten
say
fifteen
minutes
after
the
first
was
set
free
by
twelve
there
are
eleven
back
and
by
four
in
the
evening
seventeen
that
ends
the
census
total
seventeen
out
of
i
resolved
upon
a
fourth
experiment
on
the
of
may
the
weather
is
glorious
with
a
light
northerly
breeze
i
take
twenty
marked
in
pink
at
eight
in
the
morning
rotations
at
the
start
after
a
preliminary
backing
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
which
i
intend
to
take
two
rotations
on
the
road
a
fourth
on
arriving
all
those
whose
flight
i
am
able
to
follow
with
my
eyes
turn
to
my
left
that
is
to
say
towards
serignan
yet
i
had
taken
care
to
leave
the
choice
free
between
the
two
opposite
directions
in
particular
i
had
sent
away
my
dog
who
was
on
my
right
the
bees
do
not
circle
round
me
some
fly
away
at
once
the
others
the
greater
number
feeling
giddy
perhaps
after
the
pitching
of
the
journey
and
the
rolling
of
the
sling
alight
on
the
ground
a
few
yards
away
seem
to
wait
until
they
are
somewhat
recovered
and
then
fly
off
to
the
left
i
perceived
this
to
be
the
general
flight
whenever
i
was
able
to
observe
at
all
i
was
back
at
a
quarter
to
ten
two
bees
with
pink
marks
were
there
before
me
of
whom
one
was
engaged
in
building
with
her
pellet
of
mortar
in
her
mandibles
by
one
in
the
afternoon
there
were
seven
arrivals
i
saw
no
more
during
the
rest
of
the
day
total
seven
out
of
twenty
let
us
be
satisfied
with
this
the
experiment
has
been
repeated
often
enough
but
it
does
not
conclude
as
darwin
hoped
as
i
myself
hoped
especially
after
what
i
had
been
told
about
the
cat
in
vain
adopting
the
advice
given
do
i
carry
my
insects
first
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
place
at
which
i
intend
to
release
them
in
vain
when
about
to
retrace
my
steps
do
i
twirl
my
sling
with
every
complication
in
the
way
of
whirls
and
twists
that
i
am
able
to
imagine
in
vain
thinking
to
increase
the
difficulties
do
i
repeat
the
rotation
as
often
as
five
times
over
at
the
start
on
the
road
on
arriving
it
makes
no
difference
the
return
and
the
proportion
of
returns
on
the
same
day
fluctuates
between
thirty
and
forty
per
cent
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
abandon
an
idea
suggested
by
so
famous
a
man
of
science
and
cherished
all
the
more
readily
inasmuch
as
i
thought
it
likely
to
provide
a
final
solution
the
facts
are
there
more
eloquent
than
any
number
of
ingenious
views
and
the
problem
remains
as
mysterious
as
ever
in
the
following
year
i
began
experimenting
again
but
in
a
different
way
hitherto
i
had
worked
on
the
level
to
return
to
the
nest
my
lost
bees
had
only
to
cross
slight
obstacles
the
hedges
and
spinneys
of
the
tilled
fields
i
propose
to
add
to
the
difficulties
of
distance
those
of
the
ground
to
be
traversed
discontinuing
all
my
and
things
which
i
recognize
as
useless
i
think
of
releasing
my
chalicodomae
in
the
thick
of
the
serignan
woods
how
will
they
escape
from
that
labyrinth
where
in
the
early
days
i
needed
a
compass
to
find
my
way
moreover
i
shall
have
an
assistant
with
me
a
pair
of
eyes
younger
than
mine
and
to
follow
my
insects
first
flight
that
immediate
start
in
the
direction
of
the
nest
has
already
been
repeated
very
often
and
is
beginning
to
interest
me
more
than
the
return
itself
a
pharmaceutical
student
spending
a
few
days
with
my
parents
shall
be
my
eyewitness
with
him
i
shall
feel
at
ease
science
and
he
are
no
strangers
the
trip
to
the
woods
takes
place
on
the
of
may
the
weather
is
hot
and
hints
at
a
coming
storm
there
is
a
perceptible
breeze
from
the
south
but
not
enough
to
upset
my
travellers
forty
are
caught
to
shorten
the
preparations
because
of
the
distance
i
do
not
mark
them
while
they
are
on
the
nests
i
shall
mark
them
at
the
as
i
release
them
it
is
the
old
method
prolific
of
stings
but
i
prefer
it
in
order
to
save
time
it
takes
me
an
hour
to
reach
the
place
the
distance
therefore
allowing
for
windings
is
about
three
miles
the
site
selected
must
permit
me
to
recognize
the
direction
of
the
insects
first
flight
i
choose
a
clearing
in
the
middle
of
the
copses
all
around
is
a
great
expanse
of
dense
woods
shutting
out
the
horizon
on
every
side
on
the
south
in
the
direction
of
the
nests
a
curtain
of
hills
rises
to
a
height
of
some
three
hundred
feet
above
the
spot
at
which
i
stand
the
wind
is
not
strong
but
it
is
blowing
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
my
insects
will
have
to
take
in
order
to
reach
their
home
i
turn
my
back
on
serignan
so
that
when
leaving
my
fingers
the
bees
to
return
to
the
nest
will
be
obliged
to
fly
sideways
to
right
and
left
of
me
i
mark
the
insects
and
release
them
one
by
one
i
begin
operations
at
twenty
minutes
past
ten
one
half
of
the
bees
seem
rather
indolent
flutter
about
for
a
while
drop
to
the
ground
appear
to
recover
their
spirits
and
then
start
off
the
other
half
show
greater
decision
although
the
insects
have
to
fight
against
the
soft
wind
that
is
blowing
from
the
south
they
make
straight
for
the
nest
all
go
south
after
describing
a
few
circles
a
few
loops
around
us
there
is
no
exception
in
the
case
of
any
of
those
whose
departure
we
are
able
to
follow
the
fact
is
noted
by
myself
and
my
colleague
beyond
dispute
or
doubt
my
head
for
the
south
as
though
some
compass
told
them
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
i
am
back
at
twelve
none
of
the
strays
is
at
the
nest
but
a
few
minutes
later
i
catch
two
at
two
the
number
has
increased
to
nine
but
now
the
sky
clouds
over
the
wind
freshens
and
the
storm
is
approaching
we
can
no
longer
rely
on
any
further
arrivals
total
nine
out
of
forty
or
per
cent
the
proportion
is
smaller
than
in
the
former
cases
when
it
varied
between
thirty
and
forty
per
cent
must
we
attribute
this
result
to
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
can
the
have
lost
their
way
in
the
maze
of
the
forest
it
is
safer
not
to
give
an
opinion
other
causes
intervened
which
may
have
decreased
the
number
of
those
who
returned
i
marked
the
insects
at
the
i
handled
them
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
were
all
in
the
best
of
condition
on
leaving
my
stung
and
smarting
fingers
besides
the
sky
has
become
overcast
a
storm
is
imminent
in
the
month
of
may
so
variable
so
fickle
in
my
part
of
the
world
we
can
hardly
ever
count
on
a
whole
day
of
fine
weather
a
splendid
morning
is
swiftly
followed
by
a
fitful
afternoon
and
my
experiments
with
have
often
suffered
by
these
variations
all
things
considered
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
homeward
journey
across
the
forest
and
the
mountain
is
effected
just
as
readily
as
across
the
and
the
plain
i
have
one
last
resource
left
whereby
to
try
and
put
my
bees
out
of
their
latitude
i
will
first
take
them
to
a
great
distance
then
describing
a
wide
curve
i
will
return
by
another
road
and
release
my
captives
when
i
am
near
enough
to
the
village
say
about
two
miles
a
conveyance
is
necessary
this
time
my
collaborator
of
the
day
in
the
woods
offers
me
the
use
of
his
gig
the
two
of
us
set
off
with
fifteen
along
the
road
to
orange
until
we
come
to
the
viaduct
here
on
the
right
is
the
straight
ribbon
of
the
old
roman
road
the
via
domitia
we
take
it
driving
north
towards
the
uchaux
mountains
the
classic
home
of
superb
turonian
fossils
we
next
turn
back
towards
serignan
by
the
piolenc
road
a
halt
is
made
by
the
stretch
of
country
known
as
the
distance
from
which
to
the
village
is
about
one
mile
and
five
furlongs
the
reader
can
easily
follow
my
route
on
the
map
and
he
will
see
that
the
loop
described
measures
not
far
short
of
five
miles
and
a
half
at
the
same
time
favier
came
and
joined
me
at
by
the
direct
road
the
one
that
runs
through
piolenc
he
brought
with
him
fifteen
intended
for
purposes
of
comparison
with
mine
i
am
therefore
in
possession
of
two
sets
of
insects
fifteen
marked
in
pink
have
taken
the
bend
fifteen
marked
in
blue
have
come
by
the
straight
road
the
shortest
road
for
returning
to
the
nest
the
weather
is
warm
exceedingly
bright
and
very
calm
i
could
not
hope
for
a
better
day
for
my
experiment
the
insects
are
given
their
freedom
at
at
five
the
arrivals
number
seven
of
the
pink
whom
i
thought
that
i
had
bewildered
by
a
long
and
circuitous
drive
and
six
of
the
blue
who
came
to
by
the
direct
route
the
two
proportions
and
forty
per
are
almost
equal
and
the
slight
excess
in
favour
of
the
insects
that
went
the
roundabout
way
is
evidently
an
accidental
result
which
we
need
not
take
into
consideration
the
bend
described
can
not
have
helped
them
to
find
their
way
home
but
it
has
also
certainly
not
hampered
them
there
is
no
need
of
further
proof
the
intricate
movements
of
a
rotation
such
as
i
have
described
the
obstacle
of
hills
and
woods
the
pitfalls
of
a
road
which
moves
on
moves
back
and
returns
after
making
a
wide
circuit
none
of
these
is
able
to
disconcert
the
chalicodomae
or
prevent
them
from
going
back
to
the
nest
i
had
written
to
charles
darwin
telling
him
of
my
first
negative
results
those
obtained
by
swinging
the
bees
in
a
box
he
expected
a
success
and
was
much
surprised
at
the
failure
had
he
had
time
to
experiment
with
his
pigeons
they
would
have
behaved
just
like
my
bees
the
preliminary
twirling
would
not
have
affected
them
the
problem
called
for
another
method
and
what
he
proposed
was
this
place
the
insect
within
an
induction
coil
so
as
to
disturb
any
magnetic
or
diamagnetic
sensibility
which
it
seems
just
possible
that
they
may
possess
to
treat
an
insect
as
you
would
a
magnetic
needle
and
to
subject
it
to
the
current
from
an
induction
coil
in
order
to
disturb
its
magnetism
or
diamagnetism
appeared
to
me
i
must
confess
a
curious
notion
worthy
of
an
imagination
in
the
last
ditch
i
have
but
little
confidence
in
our
physics
when
they
pretend
to
explain
life
nevertheless
my
respect
for
the
great
man
would
have
made
me
resort
to
the
if
i
had
possessed
the
necessary
apparatus
but
my
village
boasts
no
scientific
resources
if
i
want
an
electric
spark
i
am
reduced
to
rubbing
a
sheet
of
paper
on
my
knees
my
physics
cupboard
contains
a
magnet
and
that
is
about
all
when
this
penury
was
realised
another
method
was
suggested
simpler
than
the
first
and
more
certain
in
its
results
as
darwin
himself
considered
make
a
very
thin
needle
into
a
magnet
then
breaking
it
into
very
short
pieces
which
would
still
be
magnetic
and
fastening
one
of
these
pieces
with
some
cement
on
the
thorax
of
the
insects
to
be
experimented
on
i
believe
that
such
a
little
magnet
from
its
close
proximity
to
the
nervous
system
of
the
insect
would
affect
it
more
than
would
the
terrestrial
currents
there
is
still
the
same
idea
of
turning
the
insect
into
a
sort
of
bar
magnet
the
terrestrial
currents
guide
it
when
returning
to
the
nest
it
becomes
a
living
compass
which
withdrawn
from
the
action
of
the
earth
by
the
proximity
of
a
loadstone
loses
its
sense
of
direction
with
a
tiny
magnet
fastened
on
its
thorax
parallel
with
the
nervous
system
and
more
powerful
than
the
terrestrial
magnetism
by
reason
of
its
comparative
nearness
the
insect
will
lose
its
bearings
naturally
in
setting
down
these
lines
i
take
shelter
behind
the
mighty
reputation
of
the
learned
begetter
of
the
idea
it
would
not
be
accepted
as
serious
coming
from
a
humble
person
like
myself
obscurity
can
not
afford
these
audacious
theories
the
experiment
seems
easy
it
is
not
beyond
the
means
at
my
disposal
let
us
attempt
it
i
magnetise
a
very
fine
needle
by
rubbing
it
with
my
bar
magnet
i
retain
only
the
slenderest
part
the
point
some
five
or
six
millimetres
long
translator
note
this
broken
piece
is
a
perfect
magnet
it
attracts
and
repels
another
magnetised
needle
hanging
from
a
thread
i
am
a
little
puzzled
as
to
the
best
way
to
fasten
it
on
the
insect
thorax
my
assistant
of
the
moment
the
pharmaceutical
student
requisitions
all
the
adhesives
in
his
laboratory
the
best
is
a
sort
of
cerecloth
which
he
prepares
specially
with
a
very
fine
material
it
possesses
the
advantage
that
it
can
be
softened
at
the
bowl
of
one
pipe
when
the
time
comes
to
operate
out
of
doors
i
cut
out
of
this
cerecloth
a
small
square
the
size
of
the
bee
thorax
and
i
insert
the
magnetised
point
through
a
few
threads
of
the
material
all
that
we
now
have
to
do
is
to
soften
the
gum
a
little
and
then
dab
the
thing
at
once
on
the
back
so
that
the
broken
needle
runs
parallel
with
the
spine
other
engines
of
the
same
kind
are
prepared
and
due
note
taken
of
their
poles
so
as
to
enable
me
to
point
the
south
pole
at
the
insect
head
in
some
cases
and
at
the
opposite
end
in
others
my
assistant
and
i
begin
by
rehearsing
the
performance
we
must
have
a
little
practice
before
trying
the
experiment
away
from
home
besides
i
want
to
see
how
the
insect
will
behave
in
its
magnetic
harness
i
take
a
at
work
in
her
cell
which
i
mark
i
carry
her
to
my
study
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
the
magnetised
outfit
is
fastened
on
the
thorax
and
the
insect
is
let
go
the
moment
she
is
free
the
bee
drops
to
the
ground
and
rolls
about
like
a
mad
thing
on
the
floor
of
the
room
she
resumes
her
flight
flops
down
again
turns
over
on
her
side
on
her
back
knocks
against
the
things
in
her
way
buzzes
noisily
flings
herself
about
desperately
and
ends
by
darting
through
the
open
window
in
headlong
flight
what
does
it
all
mean
the
magnet
appears
to
have
a
curious
effect
on
my
patient
system
what
a
fuss
she
makes
how
terrified
she
is
the
bee
seemed
utterly
distraught
at
losing
her
bearings
under
the
influence
of
my
knavish
tricks
let
us
go
to
the
nests
and
see
what
happens
we
have
not
long
to
wait
my
insect
returns
but
rid
of
its
magnetic
tackle
i
recognize
it
by
the
traces
of
gum
that
still
cling
to
the
hair
of
the
thorax
it
goes
back
to
its
cell
and
resumes
its
labours
always
on
my
guard
when
searching
the
unknown
unwilling
to
draw
conclusions
before
weighing
the
arguments
for
and
against
i
feel
doubt
creeping
in
upon
me
with
regard
to
what
i
have
seen
was
it
really
the
magnetic
influence
that
disturbed
my
bee
so
strangely
when
she
struggled
and
kicked
on
the
floor
fighting
wildly
with
both
legs
and
wings
when
she
fled
in
terror
was
she
under
the
sway
of
the
magnet
fastened
on
her
back
can
my
appliance
have
thwarted
the
guiding
influence
of
the
terrestrial
currents
on
her
nervous
system
or
was
her
distress
merely
the
result
of
an
unwonted
harness
this
is
what
remains
to
be
seen
and
that
without
delay
i
construct
a
new
apparatus
but
provide
it
with
a
short
straw
in
place
of
the
magnet
the
insect
carrying
it
on
its
back
rolls
on
the
ground
kicks
and
flings
herself
about
like
the
first
until
the
irksome
contrivance
is
removed
taking
with
it
a
part
of
the
fur
on
the
thorax
the
straw
produces
the
same
effects
as
the
magnet
in
other
words
magnetism
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
happened
my
invention
in
both
cases
alike
is
a
cumbrous
tackle
of
which
the
bee
tries
to
rid
herself
at
once
by
every
possible
means
to
look
to
her
for
normal
actions
so
long
as
she
carries
an
apparatus
magnetized
or
not
upon
her
back
is
the
same
as
expecting
to
study
the
natural
habits
of
a
dog
after
tying
a
kettle
to
his
tail
the
experiment
with
the
magnet
is
impracticable
what
would
it
tell
us
if
the
insect
consented
to
it
in
my
opinion
it
would
tell
us
nothing
in
the
matter
of
the
homing
instinct
a
magnet
would
have
no
more
influence
than
a
bit
of
straw
chapter
the
story
of
my
cats
if
this
fails
entirely
when
its
object
is
to
make
the
insect
lose
its
bearings
what
influence
can
it
have
upon
the
cat
is
the
method
of
whirling
the
animal
round
in
a
bag
to
prevent
its
return
worthy
of
confidence
i
believed
in
it
at
first
so
was
it
to
the
hopeful
idea
suggested
by
the
great
darwin
but
my
faith
is
now
shaken
my
experience
with
the
insect
makes
me
doubtful
of
the
cat
if
the
former
returns
after
being
whirled
why
should
not
the
latter
i
therefore
embark
upon
fresh
experiments
and
first
of
all
to
what
extent
does
the
cat
deserve
his
reputation
of
being
able
to
return
to
the
beloved
home
to
the
scenes
of
his
amorous
exploits
on
the
tiles
and
in
the
the
most
curious
facts
are
told
of
his
instinct
children
books
on
natural
history
abound
with
feats
that
do
the
greatest
credit
to
his
prowess
as
a
pilgrim
i
do
not
attach
much
importance
to
these
stories
they
come
from
casual
observers
uncritical
folk
given
to
exaggeration
it
is
not
everybody
who
can
talk
about
animals
correctly
when
some
one
not
of
the
craft
gets
on
the
subject
and
says
to
me
or
such
an
animal
is
black
i
begin
by
finding
out
if
it
does
not
happen
to
be
white
and
many
a
time
the
truth
is
discovered
in
the
converse
proposition
men
come
to
me
and
sing
the
praises
of
the
cat
as
a
well
and
good
we
will
now
look
upon
the
cat
as
a
poor
traveller
and
that
would
be
the
extent
of
my
knowledge
if
i
had
only
the
evidence
of
books
and
of
people
unaccustomed
to
the
scruples
of
scientific
examination
fortunately
i
am
acquainted
with
a
few
incidents
that
will
stand
the
test
of
my
incredulity
the
cat
really
deserves
his
reputation
as
a
discerning
pilgrim
let
us
relate
these
incidents
one
day
it
was
at
avignon
there
appeared
upon
the
a
cat
with
matted
coat
and
protruding
ribs
so
thin
that
his
back
was
a
mere
jagged
ridge
he
was
mewing
with
hunger
my
children
at
that
time
very
young
took
pity
on
his
misery
bread
soaked
in
milk
was
offered
him
at
the
end
of
a
reed
he
took
it
and
the
mouthfuls
succeeded
one
another
to
such
good
purpose
that
he
was
sated
and
went
off
heedless
of
the
puss
of
his
compassionate
friends
hunger
returned
and
the
starveling
reappeared
in
his
refectory
he
received
the
same
fare
of
bread
soaked
in
milk
the
same
soft
words
he
allowed
himself
to
be
tempted
he
came
down
from
the
wall
the
children
were
able
to
stroke
his
back
goodness
how
thin
he
was
it
was
the
great
topic
of
conversation
we
discussed
it
at
table
we
would
tame
the
vagabond
we
would
keep
him
we
would
make
him
a
bed
of
hay
it
was
a
most
important
matter
i
can
see
to
this
day
i
shall
always
see
the
council
of
rattleheads
deliberating
on
the
cat
fate
they
were
not
satisfied
until
the
savage
animal
remained
soon
he
grew
into
a
magnificent
tom
his
large
round
head
his
muscular
legs
his
reddish
fur
flecked
with
darker
patches
reminded
one
of
a
little
jaguar
he
was
christened
ginger
because
of
his
tawny
hue
a
mate
joined
him
later
picked
up
in
almost
similar
circumstances
such
was
the
origin
of
my
series
of
gingers
which
i
have
retained
for
little
short
of
twenty
years
through
the
vicissitudes
of
my
various
removals
the
first
of
these
removals
took
place
in
a
little
earlier
a
minister
who
has
left
a
lasting
memory
in
the
university
that
fine
man
victor
duruy
jean
victor
duruy
author
of
a
number
of
historical
works
including
a
histoire
des
romains
and
minister
of
public
instruction
under
napoleon
iii
from
to
cf
the
life
of
the
fly
chapter
translator
note
had
instituted
classes
for
the
secondary
education
of
girls
this
was
the
beginning
as
far
as
was
then
possible
of
the
burning
question
of
i
very
gladly
lent
my
humble
aid
to
this
labour
of
light
i
was
put
to
teach
physical
and
natural
science
i
had
faith
and
was
not
sparing
of
work
with
the
result
that
i
rarely
faced
a
more
attentive
or
interested
audience
the
days
on
which
the
lessons
fell
were
days
especially
when
the
lesson
was
botany
and
the
table
disappeared
from
view
under
the
treasures
of
the
neighbouring
conservatories
that
was
going
too
far
in
fact
you
can
see
how
heinous
my
crime
was
i
taught
those
young
persons
what
air
and
water
are
whence
the
lightning
comes
and
the
thunder
by
what
device
our
thoughts
are
transmitted
across
the
seas
and
continents
by
means
of
a
metal
wire
why
fire
burns
and
why
we
breathe
how
a
seed
puts
forth
shoots
and
how
a
flower
blossoms
all
eminently
hateful
things
in
the
eyes
of
some
people
whose
feeble
eyes
are
dazzled
by
the
light
of
day
the
little
lamp
must
be
put
out
as
quickly
as
possible
and
measures
taken
to
get
rid
of
the
officious
person
who
strove
to
keep
it
alight
the
scheme
was
darkly
plotted
with
the
old
maids
who
owned
my
house
and
who
saw
the
abomination
of
desolation
in
these
new
educational
methods
i
had
no
written
agreement
to
protect
me
the
bailiff
appeared
with
a
notice
on
stamped
paper
it
baldly
informed
that
i
must
move
out
within
four
weeks
from
date
failing
which
the
law
would
turn
my
goods
and
chattels
into
the
street
i
had
hurriedly
to
provide
myself
with
a
dwelling
the
first
house
which
we
found
happened
to
be
at
orange
thus
was
my
exodus
from
avignon
effected
we
were
somewhat
anxious
about
the
moving
of
the
cats
we
were
all
of
us
attached
to
them
and
should
have
thought
it
nothing
short
of
criminal
to
abandon
the
poor
creatures
whom
we
had
so
often
petted
to
distress
and
probably
to
thoughtless
persecution
the
shes
and
the
kittens
would
travel
without
any
trouble
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
put
them
in
a
basket
they
will
keep
quiet
on
the
journey
but
the
old
were
a
serious
problem
i
had
two
the
head
of
the
family
the
patriarch
and
one
of
his
descendants
quite
as
strong
as
himself
we
decided
to
take
the
grandsire
if
he
consented
to
come
and
to
leave
the
grandson
behind
after
finding
him
a
home
my
friend
loriol
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
forsaken
one
the
animal
was
carried
to
him
at
nightfall
in
a
closed
hamper
hardly
were
we
seated
at
the
talking
of
the
good
fortune
of
our
when
we
saw
a
dripping
mass
jump
through
the
window
the
shapeless
bundle
came
and
rubbed
itself
against
our
legs
purring
with
happiness
it
was
the
cat
i
learnt
his
story
next
day
on
arriving
at
loriol
he
was
locked
up
in
a
bedroom
the
moment
he
saw
himself
a
prisoner
in
the
unfamiliar
room
he
began
to
jump
about
wildly
on
the
furniture
against
the
among
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
threatening
to
make
short
work
of
everything
mme
loriol
was
frightened
by
the
little
lunatic
she
hastened
to
open
the
window
and
the
cat
leapt
out
among
the
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
back
at
home
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
he
had
to
cross
the
town
almost
from
end
to
end
he
had
to
make
his
way
through
a
long
labyrinth
of
crowded
streets
amid
a
thousand
dangers
including
first
boys
and
next
dogs
lastly
and
this
perhaps
was
an
even
more
serious
obstacle
he
had
to
pass
over
the
sorgue
a
river
running
through
avignon
there
were
bridges
at
hand
many
in
fact
but
the
animal
taking
the
shortest
cut
had
used
none
of
them
bravely
jumping
into
the
water
as
its
streaming
fur
showed
i
had
pity
on
the
poor
cat
so
faithful
to
his
home
we
agreed
to
do
our
utmost
to
take
him
with
us
we
were
spared
the
worry
a
few
days
later
he
was
found
lying
stiff
and
stark
under
a
shrub
in
the
garden
the
plucky
animal
had
fallen
a
victim
to
some
stupid
act
of
spite
some
one
had
poisoned
him
for
me
who
it
is
not
likely
that
it
was
a
friend
there
remained
the
old
cat
he
was
not
indoors
when
we
started
he
was
prowling
round
the
of
the
neighbourhood
the
carrier
was
promised
an
extra
ten
francs
if
he
brought
the
cat
to
orange
with
one
of
the
loads
which
he
had
still
to
convey
on
his
last
journey
he
brought
him
stowed
away
under
the
driver
seat
i
scarcely
knew
my
old
tom
when
we
opened
the
moving
prison
in
which
he
had
been
confined
since
the
day
before
he
came
out
looking
a
most
alarming
beast
scratching
and
spitting
with
bristling
hair
bloodshot
eyes
lips
white
with
foam
i
thought
him
mad
and
watched
him
closely
for
a
time
i
was
wrong
it
was
merely
the
fright
of
a
bewildered
animal
had
there
been
trouble
with
the
carrier
when
he
was
caught
did
he
have
a
bad
time
on
the
journey
history
is
silent
on
both
points
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
very
nature
of
the
cat
seemed
changed
there
was
no
more
friendly
purring
no
more
rubbing
against
our
legs
nothing
but
a
wild
expression
and
the
deepest
gloom
kind
treatment
could
not
soothe
him
for
a
few
weeks
longer
he
dragged
his
wretched
existence
from
corner
to
corner
then
one
day
i
found
him
lying
dead
in
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
grief
with
the
help
of
old
age
had
killed
him
would
he
have
gone
back
to
avignon
had
he
had
the
strength
i
would
not
venture
to
affirm
it
but
at
least
i
think
it
very
remarkable
that
an
animal
should
let
itself
die
of
because
the
infirmities
of
age
prevent
it
from
returning
to
its
old
haunts
what
the
patriarch
could
not
attempt
we
shall
see
another
do
over
a
much
shorter
distance
i
admit
a
fresh
move
is
resolved
upon
that
i
may
have
at
length
the
peace
and
quiet
essential
to
my
work
this
time
i
hope
that
it
will
be
the
last
i
leave
orange
for
serignan
the
family
of
gingers
has
been
renewed
the
old
ones
have
passed
away
new
ones
have
come
including
a
tom
worthy
in
all
respects
of
his
ancestors
he
alone
will
give
us
some
difficulty
the
others
the
babies
and
the
mothers
can
be
removed
without
trouble
we
put
them
into
baskets
the
tom
has
one
to
himself
so
that
the
peace
may
be
kept
the
journey
is
made
by
carriage
in
company
with
my
family
nothing
striking
happens
before
our
arrival
released
from
their
hampers
the
females
inspect
the
new
home
explore
the
rooms
one
by
one
with
their
pink
noses
they
recognize
the
furniture
they
find
their
own
seats
their
own
tables
their
own
but
the
surroundings
are
different
they
give
little
surprised
miaows
and
questioning
glances
a
few
caresses
and
a
saucer
of
milk
allay
all
their
apprehensions
and
by
the
next
day
the
mother
cats
are
acclimatised
it
is
a
different
matter
with
the
tom
we
house
him
in
the
attics
where
he
will
find
ample
room
for
his
capers
we
keep
him
company
to
relieve
the
weariness
of
captivity
we
take
him
a
double
portion
of
plates
to
lick
from
time
to
time
we
place
him
in
touch
with
some
of
his
family
to
show
him
that
he
is
not
alone
in
the
house
we
pay
him
a
host
of
attentions
in
the
hope
of
making
him
forget
orange
he
appears
in
fact
to
forget
it
he
is
gentle
under
the
hand
that
pets
him
he
comes
when
called
purrs
arches
his
back
it
is
well
a
week
of
seclusion
and
kindly
treatment
have
banished
all
notions
of
returning
let
us
give
him
his
liberty
he
goes
down
to
the
kitchen
stands
by
the
table
like
the
others
goes
out
into
the
garden
under
the
watchful
eye
of
aglae
who
does
not
lose
sight
of
him
he
prowls
all
around
with
the
most
innocent
air
he
comes
back
victory
the
will
not
run
away
next
morning
puss
not
a
sign
of
him
we
hunt
we
call
nothing
oh
the
hypocrite
the
hypocrite
how
he
has
tricked
us
he
has
gone
he
is
at
orange
none
of
those
about
me
can
believe
in
this
venturesome
pilgrimage
i
declare
that
the
deserter
is
at
this
moment
at
orange
mewing
outside
the
empty
house
aglae
and
claire
went
to
orange
they
found
the
cat
as
i
said
they
would
and
brought
him
back
in
a
hamper
his
paws
and
belly
were
covered
with
red
clay
and
yet
the
weather
was
dry
there
was
no
mud
the
cat
therefore
must
have
got
wet
crossing
the
aygues
torrent
and
the
moist
fur
had
kept
the
red
earth
of
the
fields
through
which
he
passed
the
distance
from
serignan
to
orange
in
a
straight
line
is
four
and
a
half
miles
there
are
two
bridges
over
the
aygues
one
above
and
one
below
that
line
some
distance
away
the
cat
took
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
his
instinct
told
him
the
shortest
road
and
he
followed
that
road
as
his
belly
covered
with
red
mud
proved
he
crossed
the
torrent
in
may
at
a
time
when
the
rivers
run
high
he
overcame
his
repugnance
to
water
in
order
to
return
to
his
beloved
home
the
avignon
tom
did
the
same
when
crossing
the
sorgue
the
deserter
was
reinstated
in
his
attic
at
serignan
he
stayed
there
for
a
fortnight
and
at
last
we
let
him
out
hours
had
not
elapsed
before
he
was
back
at
orange
we
had
to
abandon
him
to
his
unhappy
fate
a
neighbour
living
out
in
the
country
near
my
former
house
told
me
that
he
saw
him
one
day
hiding
behind
a
hedge
with
a
rabbit
in
his
mouth
once
no
longer
provided
with
food
he
accustomed
to
all
the
sweets
of
a
cat
existence
turned
poacher
taking
toll
of
the
round
about
my
old
home
i
heard
no
more
of
him
he
came
to
a
bad
end
no
doubt
he
had
become
a
robber
and
must
have
met
with
a
robber
fate
the
experiment
has
been
made
and
here
is
the
conclusion
twice
proved
cats
can
find
their
way
home
in
spite
of
the
distance
and
their
complete
ignorance
of
the
intervening
ground
they
have
in
their
own
fashion
the
instinct
of
my
a
second
point
remains
to
be
cleared
up
that
of
the
swinging
motion
in
the
bag
are
they
thrown
out
of
their
latitude
by
this
stratagem
are
or
they
not
i
was
thinking
of
making
some
experiments
when
more
precise
information
arrived
and
taught
me
that
it
was
not
necessary
the
first
who
acquainted
me
with
the
method
of
the
revolving
bag
was
telling
the
story
told
him
by
a
second
person
who
repeated
the
story
of
a
third
a
story
related
on
the
authority
of
a
fourth
and
so
on
none
had
tried
it
none
had
seen
it
for
himself
it
is
a
tradition
of
the
one
and
all
extol
it
as
an
infallible
method
without
for
the
most
part
having
attempted
it
and
the
reason
which
they
give
for
its
success
is
in
their
eyes
conclusive
if
say
they
we
ourselves
are
and
then
spin
round
for
a
few
seconds
we
no
longer
know
where
we
are
even
so
with
the
cat
carried
off
in
the
darkness
of
the
swinging
bag
they
argue
from
man
to
the
animal
just
as
others
argue
from
the
animal
to
man
a
faulty
method
in
either
case
if
there
really
be
two
distinct
psychic
worlds
the
belief
would
not
be
so
in
the
peasant
mind
if
facts
had
not
from
time
to
time
confirmed
it
but
we
may
assume
that
in
successful
cases
the
cats
made
to
lose
their
bearings
were
young
and
unemancipated
animals
with
those
neophytes
a
drop
of
milk
is
enough
to
dispel
the
grief
of
exile
they
do
not
return
home
whether
they
have
been
whirled
in
a
bag
or
not
people
have
thought
it
as
well
to
subject
them
to
the
whirling
operation
by
way
of
an
additional
precaution
and
the
method
has
received
the
credit
of
a
success
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
order
to
test
the
method
properly
it
should
have
been
tried
on
a
cat
a
genuine
tom
i
did
in
the
end
get
the
evidence
which
i
wanted
on
this
point
intelligent
and
trustworthy
people
not
given
to
jumping
to
conclusions
have
told
me
that
they
have
tried
the
trick
of
the
swinging
bag
to
keep
cats
from
returning
to
their
homes
none
of
them
succeeded
when
the
animal
was
though
carried
to
a
great
distance
into
another
house
and
subjected
to
a
conscientious
series
of
revolutions
the
cat
always
came
back
i
have
in
mind
more
particularly
a
destroyer
of
the
goldfish
in
a
fountain
who
when
transported
from
serignan
to
piolenc
according
to
the
method
returned
to
his
fish
who
when
carried
into
the
mountain
and
left
in
the
woods
returned
once
more
the
bag
and
the
swinging
round
proved
of
no
avail
and
the
miscreant
had
to
be
put
to
death
i
have
verified
a
fair
number
of
similar
instances
all
under
most
favourable
conditions
the
evidence
is
unanimous
the
revolving
motion
never
keeps
the
adult
cat
from
returning
home
the
popular
belief
which
i
found
so
seductive
at
first
is
a
country
prejudice
based
upon
imperfect
observation
we
must
therefore
abandon
darwin
idea
when
trying
to
explain
the
homing
of
the
cat
as
well
as
of
the
chapter
the
red
ants
the
pigeon
transported
for
hundreds
of
miles
is
able
to
find
his
way
back
to
his
the
swallow
returning
from
his
winter
quarters
in
africa
crosses
the
sea
and
once
more
takes
possession
of
the
old
nest
what
guides
them
on
these
long
journeys
is
it
sight
an
observer
of
supreme
intelligence
one
who
though
surpassed
by
others
in
the
knowledge
of
the
stuffed
animal
under
a
glass
case
is
almost
unrivalled
in
his
knowledge
of
the
live
animal
in
its
wild
state

toussenel
the
author
of
a
number
of
interesting
and
valuable
works
on
translator
note
the
admirable
writer
of
des
betes
speaks
of
sight
and
meteorology
as
the
guides
french
bird
he
says
by
experience
that
the
cold
weather
comes
from
the
north
the
hot
from
the
south
the
dry
from
the
east
and
the
wet
from
the
west
that
is
enough
meteorological
knowledge
to
tell
him
the
cardinal
points
and
to
direct
his
flight
the
pigeon
taken
in
a
closed
basket
from
brussels
to
toulouse
has
certainly
no
means
of
reading
the
map
of
the
route
with
his
eyes
but
no
one
can
prevent
him
from
feeling
by
the
warmth
of
the
atmosphere
that
he
is
pursuing
the
road
to
the
south
when
restored
to
liberty
at
toulouse
he
already
knows
that
the
direction
which
he
must
follow
to
regain
his
is
the
direction
of
the
north
therefore
he
wings
straight
in
that
direction
and
does
not
stop
until
he
nears
those
latitudes
where
the
mean
temperature
is
that
of
the
zone
which
he
inhabits
if
he
does
not
find
his
home
at
the
first
onset
it
is
because
he
has
borne
a
little
too
much
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
in
any
case
it
takes
him
but
a
few
hours
search
in
an
easterly
or
westerly
direction
to
correct
his
mistake
the
explanation
is
a
tempting
one
when
the
journey
is
taken
north
and
south
but
it
does
not
apply
to
a
journey
east
and
west
on
the
same
isothermal
line
besides
it
has
this
defect
that
it
does
not
admit
of
generalization
one
can
not
talk
of
sight
and
still
less
of
the
influence
of
a
change
of
climate
when
a
cat
returns
home
from
one
end
of
a
town
to
the
other
threading
his
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
streets
and
alleys
which
he
sees
for
the
first
time
nor
is
it
sight
that
guides
my
especially
when
they
are
let
loose
in
the
thick
of
a
wood
their
low
flight
eight
or
nine
feet
above
the
ground
does
not
allow
them
to
take
a
panoramic
view
nor
to
gather
the
lie
of
the
land
what
need
have
they
of
topography
their
hesitation
is
after
describing
a
few
narrow
circles
around
the
experimenter
they
start
in
the
direction
of
the
nest
despite
the
cover
of
the
forest
despite
the
screen
of
a
tall
chain
of
hills
which
they
cross
by
mounting
the
slope
at
no
great
height
from
the
ground
sight
enables
them
to
avoid
obstacles
without
giving
them
a
general
idea
of
their
road
nor
has
meteorology
aught
to
do
with
the
case
the
climate
has
not
varied
in
those
few
miles
of
transit
my
have
not
learnt
from
any
experience
of
heat
cold
dryness
and
damp
an
existence
of
a
few
duration
does
not
allow
of
this
and
even
if
they
knew
all
about
the
four
cardinal
points
there
is
no
difference
in
climate
between
the
spot
where
their
nest
lies
and
the
spot
at
which
they
are
released
so
that
does
not
help
them
to
settle
the
direction
in
which
they
are
to
travel
to
explain
these
many
mysteries
we
are
driven
therefore
to
appeal
to
yet
another
mystery
that
is
to
say
a
special
sense
denied
to
mankind
charles
darwin
whose
weighty
authority
no
one
will
gainsay
arrives
at
the
same
conclusion
to
ask
if
the
animal
be
not
impressed
by
the
terrestrial
currents
to
enquire
if
it
be
not
influenced
by
the
close
proximity
of
a
magnetic
needle
what
is
this
but
the
recognition
of
a
magnetic
sense
do
we
possess
a
similar
faculty
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
the
magnetism
of
the
physicists
and
not
of
the
magnetism
of
the
mesmers
and
cagliostros
assuredly
we
possess
nothing
remotely
like
it
what
need
would
the
mariner
have
of
a
compass
were
he
himself
a
compass
and
this
is
what
the
great
scientist
acknowledges
a
special
sense
so
foreign
to
our
organism
that
we
are
not
able
to
form
a
conception
of
it
guides
the
pigeon
the
swallow
the
cat
the
and
a
host
of
others
when
away
from
home
whether
this
sense
be
magnetic
or
no
i
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
decide
i
am
content
to
have
helped
in
no
small
degree
to
establish
its
existence
a
new
sense
added
to
our
number
what
an
acquisition
what
a
source
of
progress
why
are
we
deprived
of
it
it
would
have
been
a
fine
weapon
and
of
great
service
in
the
struggle
for
life
if
as
is
contended
the
whole
of
the
animal
kingdom
including
man
is
derived
from
a
single
mould
the
original
cell
and
becomes
in
the
course
of
time
favouring
the
and
leaving
the
less
to
perish
how
comes
it
that
this
wonderful
sense
is
the
portion
of
a
humble
few
and
that
it
has
left
no
trace
in
man
the
culminating
achievement
of
the
zoological
progression
our
precursors
were
very
to
let
so
magnificent
an
inheritance
go
it
was
better
worth
keeping
than
a
vertebra
of
the
coccyx
or
a
hair
of
the
moustache
does
not
the
fact
that
this
sense
has
not
been
handed
down
to
us
point
to
a
flaw
in
the
pedigree
i
submit
the
little
problem
to
the
evolutionists
and
i
should
much
like
to
know
what
their
protoplasm
and
their
nucleus
have
to
say
to
it
is
this
unknown
sense
localized
in
a
particular
part
of
the
wasp
and
the
bee
is
it
exercised
by
means
of
a
special
organ
we
immediately
think
of
the
antennae
the
antennae
are
what
we
always
fall
back
upon
when
the
insect
actions
are
not
quite
clear
to
us
we
gladly
put
down
to
them
whatever
is
most
necessary
to
our
arguments
for
that
matter
i
had
plenty
of
fairly
good
reasons
for
suspecting
them
of
containing
the
sense
of
direction
when

tiny

fumbling
at

seems
to
recognize
the
presence
of
the
underground
prey
could
not
those
inquisitive
filaments
which
seem
to
guide
the
insect
when
hunting
also
guide
it
when
travelling
this
remained
to
be
seen
and
i
did
see
i
took
some
and
amputated
their
antennae
with
the
scissors
as
closely
as
i
could
these
maimed
ones
were
then
carried
to
a
distance
and
released
they
returned
to
the
nest
with
as
little
difficulty
as
the
others

in
the

way

rids
us
of
one
hypothesis
the
sense

direction
is
not
exercised
by
the
antennae
then
where
is
its
seat
i
do
not
know
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
without
antennae
though
they
go
back
to
the
cells
do
not
resume
work
they
persist
in
flying
in
front
of
their
masonry
they
alight
on
the
clay
cup
they
perch
on
the
rim
of
the
cell
and
there
seemingly
pensive
and
forlorn
stand
for
a
long
time
contemplating
the
work
which
will
never
be
finished
they
go
off
they
come
back
they
drive
away
any

but
they
fetch

the

loses
all

responsibilities
what
would

for

form
a

outside

wait

for
their

endless
brawls

then
disappear
when

myself
about
returning
to
the
natal

rather
than
settling
elsewhere
provided
that
they
find
some
recipient
for
their
amatory
declarations
i
was
mistaken
the
males
do
return
to
the
nest
it
is
true
that
in
view
of
their
lack
of
strength
i
did
not
subject
them
to
a
long
journey
about
half
a
mile
or
so
nevertheless
this
represented
to
them
a
distant
expedition
an
unknown
country
for
i
do
not
see
them
go
on
long
excursions
by
day
they
visit
the
nests
or
the

in

they
take
refuge
in

the

it
was
a
splendid
opportunity
to
try
and
discover
to
what
extent
the
sense
of

may
be
regarded
as
general
in
the

i
took
advantage
of
it
well
the

tricornis
both
male

very
quickly
with
small
numbers
and
over
short
distances
but
the
results
agreed
so
closely
with
the
others
that
i
was
convinced
all

the
return
to

be
met
upon
the
road
the
ranks
are
fairly
well
maintained
but
at
the
first
suspicion
of
an
the
vanguard
halts
and
deploys
in
a
swarming
throng
which
is
increased
by
the
others
as
they
come
up
hurriedly
scouts
are
sent
out
the
amazons
recognize
that
they
are
on
a
wrong
track
and
the
column
forms
again
it
resumes
its
march
crosses
the
disappears
from
sight
in
the
grass
reappears
farther
on
threads
its
way
through
the
heaps
of
dead
leaves
comes
out
again
and
continues
its
search
at
last
a
nest
of
black
ants
is
discovered
the
red
ants
hasten
down
to
the
dormitories
where
the
nymphs
lie
and
soon
emerge
with
their
booty
then
we
have
at
the
gates
of
the
underground
city
a
bewildering
scrimmage
between
the
defending
blacks
and
the
attacking
reds
the
struggle
is
too
unequal
to
remain
indecisive
victory
falls
to
the
reds
who
race
back
to
their
abode
each
with
her
prize
a
swaddled
nymph
dangling
from
her
mandibles
the
reader
who
is
not
acquainted
with
these
habits
would
be
greatly
interested
in
the
story
of
the
amazons
i
relinquish
it
with
much
regret
it
would
take
us
too
far
from
our
subject
namely
the
return
to
the
nest
the
distance
covered
by
the
column
varies
it
all
depends
on
whether
black
ants
are
plentiful
in
the
neighbourhood
at
times
ten
or
twenty
yards
suffice
at
others
it
requires
fifty
a
hundred
or
more
i
once
saw
the
expedition
go
beyond
the
garden
the
amazons
scaled
the
surrounding
wall
which
was
thirteen
feet
high
at
that
point
climbed
over
it
and
went
on
a
little
farther
into
a
cornfield
as
for
the
route
taken
this
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
marching
column
bare
ground
thick
grass
a
heap
of
dead
leaves
or
stones
brickwork
a
clump
of
shrubs
all
are
crossed
without
any
marked
preference
for
one
sort
of
road
rather
than
another
what
is
rigidly
fixed
is
the
path
home
which
follows
the
outward
track
in
all
its
windings
and
all
its
crossings
however
difficult
laden
with
their
plunder
the
red
ants
return
to
the
nest
by
the
same
road
often
an
exceedingly
complicated
one
which
the
exigencies
of
the
chase
compelled
them
to
take
originally
they
repass
each
spot
which
they
passed
at
first
and
this
is
to
them
a
matter
of
such
imperative
necessity
that
no
additional
fatigue
nor
even
the
gravest
danger
can
make
them
alter
the
track
let
us
suppose
that
they
have
crossed
a
thick
heap
of
dead
leaves
representing
to
them
a
path
beset
with
yawning
gulfs
where
every
moment
some
one
falls
where
many
are
exhausted
as
they
struggle
out
of
the
hollows
and
reach
the
heights
by
means
of
swaying
bridges
emerging
at
last
from
the
labyrinth
of
lanes
no
matter
on
their
return
they
will
not
fail
though
weighed
down
with
their
burden
once
more
to
struggle
through
that
weary
maze
to
avoid
all
this
fatigue
they
would
have
but
to
swerve
slightly
from
the
original
path
for
the
good
smooth
road
is
there
hardly
a
step
away
this
little
deviation
never
occurs
to
them
i
came
upon
them
one
day
when
they
were
on
one
of
their
raids
they
were
marching
along
the
inner
edge
of
the
of
the
where
i
have
replaced
the
old
batrachians
by
a
colony
of
the
wind
was
blowing
very
hard
from
the
north
and
taking
the
column
in
flank
sent
whole
rows
of
the
ants
flying
into
the
water
the
fish
hurried
up
they
watched
the
performance
and
gobbled
up
the
drowning
insects
it
was
a
difficult
bit
and
the
column
was
decimated
before
it
had
passed
i
expected
to
see
the
return
journey
made
by
another
road
which
would
wind
round
and
avoid
the
fatal
cliff
not
at
all
the
band
resumed
the
parlous
path
and
the
goldfish
received
a
double
windfall
the
ants
and
their
prizes
rather
than
alter
its
track
the
column
was
decimated
a
second
time
it
is
not
easy
to
find
the
way
home
again
after
a
distant
expedition
during
which
there
have
been
various
sorties
nearly
always
by
different
paths
and
this
difficulty
makes
it
absolutely
necessary
for
the
amazons
to
return
by
the
same
road
by
which
they
went
the
insect
has
no
choice
of
route
if
it
would
not
be
lost
on
the
way
it
must
come
back
by
the
track
which
it
knows
and
which
it
has
lately
travelled
the
processionary
caterpillars
when
they
leave
their
nest
and
go
to
another
branch
on
another
tree
in
search
of
a
type
of
leaf
more
to
their
taste
carpet
the
course
with
silk
and
are
able
to
return
home
by
following
the
threads
stretched
along
their
road
this
is
the
most
elementary
method
open
to
the
insect
liable
to
stray
on
its
excursions
a
silken
path
brings
it
home
again
the
processionaries
with
their
unsophisticated
are
very
different
from
the
and
others
who
have
a
special
sense
to
guide
them
the
amazon
though
belonging
to
the
hymenopteron
clan
herself
possesses
rather
limited
as
witness
her
compulsory
return
by
her
former
trail
can
she
imitate
to
a
certain
extent
the
method
that
is
to
say
does
she
leave
along
the
road
traversed
not
a
series
of
conducting
threads
for
she
is
not
equipped
for
that
work
but
some
odorous
emanation
for
instance
some
formic
scent
which
would
allow
her
to
guide
herself
by
means
of
the
olfactory
sense
this
view
is
pretty
generally
accepted
the
ants
people
say
are
guided
by
the
sense
of
smell
and
this
sense
of
smell
appears
to
have
its
seat
in
the
antennae
which
we
see
in
continual
palpitation
it
is
doubtless
very
reprehensible
but
i
must
admit
that
the
theory
does
not
inspire
me
with
overwhelming
enthusiasm
in
the
first
place
i
have
my
suspicions
about
a
sense
of
smell
seated
in
the
antennae
i
have
given
my
reasons
before
and
next
i
hope
to
prove
by
experiment
that
the
red
ants
are
not
guided
by
a
scent
of
any
kind
to
lie
in
wait
for
my
amazons
for
whole
afternoons
on
end
often
unsuccessfully
meant
taking
up
too
much
of
my
time
i
engaged
an
assistant
whose
hours
were
not
so
much
occupied
as
mine
it
was
my
lucie
a
little
rogue
who
liked
to
hear
my
stories
of
the
ants
she
had
been
present
at
the
great
battle
between
the
reds
and
blacks
and
was
much
impressed
by
the
rape
of
the
babies
in
her
exalted
functions
very
proud
of
already
serving
that
august
lady
science
my
little
lucie
would
wander
about
the
garden
when
the
weather
seemed
propitious
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
red
ants
having
been
commissioned
to
reconnoitre
carefully
the
road
to
the
pillaged
she
had
given
proof
of
her
zeal
i
could
rely
upon
it
one
day
while
i
was
spinning
out
my
daily
quota
of
prose
there
came
a
banging
at
my
i
lucie
come
quick
the
reds
have
gone
into
the
blacks
house
come
quick
do
you
know
the
road
they
took
i
marked
it
marked
it
how
did
what
did
i
scattered
little
white
stones
along
the
road
i
hurried
out
things
had
happened
as
my
colleague
said
lucie
had
secured
her
provision
of
pebbles
in
advance
and
on
seeing
the
amazon
regiment
leave
barracks
had
followed
them
step
by
step
and
placed
her
stones
at
intervals
along
the
road
covered
the
ants
had
made
their
raid
and
were
beginning
to
return
along
the
track
of
pebbles
the
distance
to
the
nest
was
about
a
hundred
paces
which
gave
me
time
to
make
preparations
for
an
experiment
previously
contemplated
i
take
a
big
broom
and
sweep
the
track
for
about
a
yard
across
the
dusty
particles
on
the
surface
are
thus
removed
and
replaced
by
others
if
they
were
tainted
with
any
odorous
effluvia
their
absence
will
throw
the
ants
off
the
track
i
divide
the
road
in
this
way
at
four
different
points
a
few
feet
a
part
the
column
arrives
at
the
first
section
the
hesitation
of
the
ants
is
evident
some
recede
and
then
return
only
to
recede
once
more
others
wander
along
the
edge
of
the
cutting
others
disperse
sideways
and
seem
to
be
trying
to
skirt
the
unknown
country
the
head
of
the
column
at
first
closed
up
to
a
width
of
a
foot
or
so
now
scatters
to
three
or
four
yards
but
fresh
arrivals
gather
in
their
numbers
before
the
obstacle
they
form
a
mighty
array
an
undecided
horde
at
last
a
few
ants
venture
into
the
swept
zone
and
others
follow
while
a
few
have
meantime
gone
ahead
and
recovered
the
track
by
a
circuitous
route
at
the
other
cuttings
there
are
the
same
halts
the
same
hesitations
nevertheless
they
are
crossed
either
in
a
straight
line
or
by
going
round
in
spite
of
my
snares
the
ants
manage
to
return
to
the
nest
and
that
by
way
of
the
little
stones
the
result
of
the
experiment
seems
to
argue
in
favour
of
the
sense
of
smell
four
times
over
there
are
manifest
hesitations
wherever
the
road
is
swept
though
the
return
takes
place
nevertheless
along
the
original
track
this
may
be
due
to
the
uneven
work
of
the
broom
which
has
left
certain
particles
of
the
scented
dust
in
position
the
ants
who
went
round
the
cleared
portion
may
have
been
guided
by
the
sweepings
removed
to
either
side
before
therefore
pronouncing
judgment
for
or
against
the
sense
of
smell
it
were
well
to
renew
the
experiment
under
better
conditions
and
to
remove
everything
containing
a
vestige
of
scent
a
few
days
later
when
i
have
definitely
decided
on
my
plan
lucie
resumes
her
watch
and
soon
comes
to
tell
me
of
a
sortie
i
was
counting
on
it
for
the
amazons
rarely
miss
an
expedition
during
the
hot
and
sultry
afternoons
of
june
and
july
especially
when
the
weather
threatens
storm
pebbles
once
more
mark
out
the
road
on
which
i
choose
the
point
to
my
schemes
a
is
fixed
to
one
of
the
feeders
of
the
pond
the
sluice
is
opened
and
the
ants
path
is
cut
by
a
continuous
torrent
two
or
three
feet
wide
and
of
unlimited
length
the
sheet
of
water
flows
swiftly
and
plentifully
at
first
so
as
to
wash
the
ground
well
and
remove
anything
that
may
possess
a
scent
this
thorough
washing
lasts
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
when
the
ants
draw
near
returning
from
the
plunder
i
let
the
water
flow
more
slowly
and
reduce
its
depth
so
as
not
to
overtax
the
strength
of
the
insects
now
we
have
an
obstacle
which
the
amazons
must
surmount
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
them
to
follow
the
first
trail
this
time
the
hesitation
lasts
long
and
the
stragglers
have
time
to
come
up
with
the
head
of
the
column
nevertheless
an
attempt
is
made
to
cross
the
torrent
by
means
of
a
few
bits
of
gravel
projecting
above
the
water
then
failing
to
find
bottom
the
more
reckless
of
the
ants
are
swept
off
their
feet
and
without
loosing
hold
of
their
prizes
drift
away
land
on
some
shoal
regain
the
bank
and
renew
their
search
for
a
ford
a
few
straws
borne
on
the
waters
stop
and
become
so
many
shaky
bridges
on
which
the
ants
climb
dry
are
converted
into
rafts
each
with
its
load
of
passengers
the
more
venturesome
partly
by
their
own
efforts
partly
by
good
luck
reach
the
opposite
bank
without
adventitious
aid
i
see
some
who
dragged
by
the
current
to
one
or
the
other
bank
two
or
three
yards
off
seem
very
much
concerned
as
to
what
they
shall
do
next
amid
this
disorder
amid
the
dangers
of
drowning
not
one
lets
go
her
booty
she
would
not
dream
of
doing
so
death
sooner
than
that
in
a
word
the
torrent
is
crossed
somehow
or
other
along
the
regular
track
the
scent
of
the
road
can
not
be
the
cause
of
this
it
seems
to
me
for
the
torrent
not
only
washed
the
ground
some
time
beforehand
but
also
pours
fresh
water
on
it
all
the
time
that
the
crossing
is
taking
place
let
us
now
see
what
will
happen
when
the
formic
scent
if
there
really
be
one
on
the
trail
is
replaced
by
another
much
stronger
odour
one
perceptible
to
our
own
sense
of
smell
which
the
first
is
not
at
least
not
under
present
conditions
i
wait
for
a
third
sortie
and
at
one
point
in
the
road
taken
by
the
ants
rub
the
ground
with
some
handfuls
of
freshly
gathered
mint
i
cover
the
track
a
little
farther
on
with
the
leaves
of
the
same
plant
the
ants
on
their
return
cross
the
section
over
which
the
mint
was
rubbed
without
apparently
giving
it
a
thought
they
hesitate
in
front
of
the
section
heaped
up
with
leaves
and
then
go
straight
on
after
these
two
experiments
first
with
the
torrent
of
water
which
washes
away
all
traces
of
smell
from
the
ground
and
then
with
the
mint
which
changes
the
smell
i
think
that
we
are
no
longer
at
liberty
to
quote
scent
as
the
guide
of
the
ants
that
return
to
the
nest
by
the
road
which
they
took
at
starting
further
tests
will
tell
us
more
about
it
without
interfering
with
the
soil
i
now
lay
across
the
track
some
large
sheets
of
paper
newspapers
keeping
them
in
position
with
a
few
small
stones
in
front
of
this
carpet
which
completely
alters
the
appearance
of
the
road
without
removing
any
sort
of
scent
that
it
may
possess
the
ants
hesitate
even
longer
than
before
any
of
my
other
snares
including
the
torrent
they
are
compelled
to
make
manifold
attempts
reconnaissances
to
right
and
left
forward
movements
and
repeated
retreats
before
venturing
altogether
into
the
unknown
zone
the
paper
straits
are
crossed
at
last
and
the
march
resumed
as
usual
another
ambush
awaits
the
amazons
some
distance
farther
on
i
have
divided
the
track
by
a
thin
layer
of
yellow
sand
the
ground
itself
being
grey
this
change
of
colour
alone
is
enough
for
a
moment
to
disconcert
the
ants
who
again
hesitate
in
the
same
way
though
not
for
so
long
as
they
did
before
the
paper
eventually
this
obstacle
is
overcome
like
the
others
as
neither
the
stretch
of
sand
nor
the
stretch
of
paper
got
rid
of
any
scented
effluvia
with
which
the
trail
may
have
been
impregnated
it
is
patent
that
as
the
ants
hesitated
and
stopped
in
the
same
way
as
before
they
find
their
way
not
by
sense
of
smell
but
really
and
truly
by
sense
of
sight
for
every
time
that
i
alter
the
appearance
of
the
track
in
any
way
whatever
whether
by
my
destructive
broom
my
streaming
water
my
green
mint
my
paper
carpet
or
my
golden
sand
the
returning
column
calls
a
halt
hesitates
and
attempts
to
account
for
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
yes
it
is
sight
but
a
very
dull
sight
whose
horizon
is
altered
by
the
shifting
of
a
few
bits
of
gravel
to
this
short
sight
a
strip
of
paper
a
bed
of
a
layer
of
yellow
sand
a
stream
of
water
a
furrow
made
by
the
broom
or
even
lesser
modifications
are
enough
to
transform
the
landscape
and
the
regiment
eager
to
reach
home
as
fast
as
it
can
with
its
loot
halts
uneasily
on
beholding
this
unfamiliar
scenery
if
the
doubtful
zones
are
at
length
passed
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
fresh
attempts
are
constantly
being
made
to
cross
the
doctored
strips
and
that
at
last
a
few
ants
recognize
spots
beyond
them
the
others
relying
on
their
sisters
follow
sight
would
not
be
enough
if
the
amazon
had
not
also
at
her
service
a
correct
memory
for
places
the
memory
of
an
ant
what
can
that
be
in
what
does
it
resemble
ours
i
have
no
answers
to
these
questions
but
a
few
words
will
enable
me
to
prove
that
the
insect
has
a
very
exact
and
persistent
recollection
of
places
which
it
has
once
visited
here
is
something
which
i
have
often
witnessed
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
plundered
offers
the
amazons
a
richer
spoil
than
the
invading
column
is
able
to
carry
away
or
again
the
region
visited
is
rich
in
another
raid
is
necessary
to
exploit
the
site
thoroughly
in
such
cases
a
second
expedition
takes
place
sometimes
on
the
next
day
sometimes
two
or
three
days
later
this
time
the
column
does
no
reconnoitring
on
the
way
it
goes
straight
to
the
spot
known
to
abound
in
nymphs
and
travels
by
the
identical
path
which
it
followed
before
it
has
sometimes
happened
that
i
have
marked
with
small
stones
for
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
the
road
pursued
a
couple
of
days
earlier
and
have
then
found
the
amazons
proceeding
by
the
same
route
stone
by
stone
will
go
first
here
and
then
there
i
said
according
to
the
position
of
the
and
they
would
in
fact
go
first
here
and
then
there
skirting
my
line
of
pebbles
without
any
noticeable
deviation
can
one
believe
that
odoriferous
emanations
diffused
along
the
route
are
going
to
last
for
several
days
no
one
would
dare
to
suggest
it
it
must
therefore
be
sight
that
directs
the
amazons
sight
assisted
by
a
memory
for
places
and
this
memory
is
tenacious
enough
to
retain
the
impression
until
the
next
day
and
later
it
is
scrupulously
faithful
for
it
guides
the
column
by
the
same
path
as
on
the
day
before
across
the
thousand
irregularities
of
the
ground
how
will
the
amazon
behave
when
the
locality
is
unknown
to
her
apart
from
topographical
memory
which
can
not
serve
her
here
the
region
in
which
i
imagine
her
being
still
unexplored
does
the
ant
possess
the
sense
of
direction
at
least
within
modest
limits
and
is
she
able
thus
to
regain
her
or
her
marching
column
the
different
parts
of
the
garden
are
not
all
visited
by
the
marauding
legions
to
the
same
extent
the
north
side
is
exploited
by
preference
doubtless
because
the
forays
in
that
direction
are
more
productive
the
amazons
therefore
generally
direct
their
troops
north
of
their
barracks
i
seldom
see
them
in
the
south
this
part
of
the
garden
is
if
not
wholly
unknown
at
least
much
less
familiar
to
them
than
the
other
having
said
that
let
us
observe
the
conduct
of
the
strayed
ant
i
take
up
my
position
near
the
and
when
the
column
returns
from
the
i
force
an
ant
to
step
on
a
leaf
which
i
hold
out
to
her
without
touching
her
i
carry
her
two
or
three
paces
away
from
her
regiment
no
more
than
that
but
in
a
southerly
direction
it
is
enough
to
put
her
astray
to
make
her
lose
her
bearings
entirely
i
see
the
amazon
now
replaced
on
the
ground
wander
about
at
random
still
i
need
hardly
say
with
her
booty
in
her
mandibles
i
see
her
hurry
away
from
her
comrades
thinking
that
she
is
rejoining
them
i
see
her
retrace
her
steps
turn
aside
again
try
to
the
right
try
to
the
left
and
grope
in
a
host
of
directions
without
succeeding
in
finding
her
whereabouts
the
pugnacious
is
utterly
lost
two
steps
away
from
her
party
i
have
in
mind
certain
strays
who
after
half
an
hour
searching
had
not
succeeded
in
recovering
the
route
and
were
going
farther
and
farther
from
it
still
carrying
the
nymph
in
their
teeth
what
became
of
them
what
did
they
do
with
their
spoil
i
had
not
the
patience
to
follow
those
marauders
to
the
end
let
us
repeat
the
experiment
but
place
the
amazon
to
the
north
after
more
or
less
prolonged
hesitations
after
a
search
now
in
this
direction
now
in
that
the
ant
succeeds
in
finding
her
column
she
knows
the
locality
here
of
a
surety
is
a
hymenopteron
deprived
of
that
sense
of
direction
which
other
hymenoptera
enjoy
she
has
in
her
favour
a
memory
for
places
and
nothing
more
a
deviation
amounting
to
two
or
three
of
our
strides
is
enough
to
make
her
lose
her
way
and
to
keep
her
from
returning
to
her
people
whereas
miles
across
unknown
country
will
not
foil
the
i
expressed
my
surprise
just
now
that
man
was
deprived
of
a
wonderful
sense
wherewith
certain
animals
are
endowed
the
enormous
distance
between
the
two
things
compared
might
furnish
matter
for
discussion
in
the
present
case
the
distance
no
longer
exists
we
have
to
do
with
two
insects
very
near
akin
two
hymenoptera
why
if
they
issue
from
the
same
mould
has
one
a
sense
which
the
other
has
not
an
additional
sense
constituting
a
much
more
overpowering
factor
than
the
structural
details
i
will
wait
until
the
evolutionists
condescend
to
give
me
a
valid
reason
to
return
to
this
memory
for
places
whose
tenacity
and
fidelity
i
have
just
recognized
to
what
degree
does
it
consent
to
retain
impressions
does
the
amazon
require
repeated
journeys
in
order
to
learn
her
geography
or
is
a
single
expedition
enough
for
her
are
the
line
followed
and
the
places
visited
engraved
on
her
memory
from
the
first
the
red
ant
does
not
lend
herself
to
the
tests
that
might
furnish
the
reply
the
experimenter
is
unable
to
decide
whether
the
path
followed
by
the
expeditionary
column
is
being
covered
for
the
first
time
nor
is
it
in
his
power
to
compel
the
legion
to
adopt
this
or
that
different
road
when
the
amazons
go
out
to
plunder
the
they
take
the
direction
which
they
please
and
we
are
not
allowed
to
interfere
with
their
march
let
us
turn
to
other
hymenoptera
for
information
i
select
the
pompili
whose
habits
we
shall
study
in
detail
in
a
later
chapter
for
the
wasp
known
as
the
pompilus
or
ringed
calicurgus
cf
the
life
and
love
of
the
insect
by
henri
fabre
translated
by
alexander
teixeira
de
mattos
chapter
translator
note
they
are
hunters
of
spiders
and
diggers
of
burrows
the
game
the
food
of
the
coming
larva
is
first
caught
and
paralysed
the
home
is
excavated
afterwards
as
the
heavy
prey
would
be
a
grave
encumbrance
to
the
wasp
in
search
of
a
convenient
site
the
spider
is
placed
high
up
on
a
tuft
of
grass
or
brushwood
out
of
the
reach
of
marauders
especially
ants
who
might
damage
the
precious
morsel
in
the
lawful
owner
absence
after
fixing
her
booty
on
the
verdant
pinnacle
the
pompilus
casts
around
for
a
favourable
spot
and
digs
her
burrow
during
the
process
of
excavation
she
returns
from
time
to
time
to
her
spider
she
nibbles
at
the
prize
feels
touches
it
here
and
there
as
though
taking
stock
of
its
plumpness
and
congratulating
herself
on
the
plentiful
provender
then
she
returns
to
her
burrow
and
goes
on
digging
should
anything
alarm
or
distress
her
she
does
not
merely
inspect
her
spider
she
also
brings
her
a
little
closer
to
her
but
never
fails
to
lay
her
on
the
top
of
a
tuft
of
verdure
these
are
the
manoeuvres
of
which
i
can
avail
myself
to
gauge
the
elasticity
of
the
wasp
memory
while
the
pompilus
is
at
work
on
the
burrow
i
seize
the
prey
and
place
it
in
an
exposed
spot
half
a
yard
away
from
its
original
position
the
pompilus
soon
leaves
the
hole
to
enquire
after
her
booty
and
goes
straight
to
the
spot
where
she
left
it
this
sureness
of
direction
this
faithful
memory
for
places
can
be
explained
by
repeated
previous
visits
i
know
nothing
of
what
has
happened
beforehand
let
us
take
no
notice
of
this
first
expedition
the
others
will
be
more
conclusive
for
the
moment
the
pompilus
without
the
least
hesitation
finds
the
tuft
of
grass
whereon
her
prey
was
lying
then
come
marches
and
upon
that
tuft
minute
explorations
and
frequent
returns
to
the
exact
spot
where
the
spider
was
deposited
at
last
convinced
that
the
prize
is
no
longer
there
the
wasp
makes
a
leisurely
survey
of
the
neighbourhood
feeling
the
ground
with
her
antennae
as
she
goes
the
spider
is
descried
in
the
exposed
spot
where
i
had
placed
her
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
pompilus
who
goes
forward
and
then
suddenly
steps
back
with
a
start
it
alive
she
seems
to
ask
it
dead
is
it
really
my
spider
let
us
be
wary
the
hesitation
does
not
last
long
the
huntress
grabs
her
victim
drags
her
backwards
and
places
her
still
high
up
on
a
second
tuft
of
herbage
two
or
three
steps
away
from
the
first
she
then
goes
back
to
the
burrow
and
digs
for
a
while
for
the
second
time
i
remove
the
spider
and
lay
her
at
some
distance
on
the
bare
ground
this
is
the
moment
to
judge
of
the
wasp
memory
two
tufts
of
grass
have
served
as
temporary
for
the
game
the
first
to
which
she
returned
with
such
precision
the
wasp
may
have
learnt
to
know
by
a
more
or
less
thorough
examination
by
reiterated
visits
that
escaped
my
eye
but
the
second
has
certainly
made
but
a
slight
impression
on
her
memory
she
adopted
it
without
any
studied
choice
she
stopped
there
just
long
enough
to
hoist
her
spider
to
the
top
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
and
saw
it
hurriedly
in
passing
is
that
rapid
glance
enough
to
provide
an
exact
recollection
besides
there
are
now
two
localities
to
be
modelled
in
the
insect
memory
the
first
shelf
may
easily
be
confused
with
the
second
to
which
will
the
pompilus
go
we
shall
soon
find
out
here
she
comes
leaving
the
burrow
to
pay
a
fresh
visit
to
the
spider
she
runs
straight
to
the
second
tuft
where
she
hunts
about
for
a
long
time
for
her
absent
prey
she
knows
that
it
was
there
when
last
seen
and
not
elsewhere
she
persists
in
looking
for
it
there
and
does
not
once
think
of
going
back
to
the
first
perch
the
first
tuft
of
grass
no
longer
counts
the
second
alone
interests
her
and
then
the
search
in
the
neighbourhood
begins
again
on
finding
her
game
on
the
bare
spot
where
i
myself
have
placed
it
the
pompilus
quickly
deposits
the
spider
on
a
third
tuft
of
grass
and
the
experiment
is
renewed
this
time
the
pompilus
hurries
to
the
third
tuft
when
she
comes
to
look
after
her
spider
she
hurries
to
it
without
hesitation
without
confusing
it
in
any
way
with
the
first
two
which
she
scorns
to
visit
so
sure
is
her
memory
i
do
the
same
thing
a
couple
of
times
more
and
the
insect
always
returns
to
the
last
perch
without
worrying
about
the
others
i
stand
amazed
at
the
memory
of
that
pigmy
she
need
but
catch
a
single
hurried
glimpse
of
a
spot
that
differs
in
no
wise
from
a
host
of
others
in
order
to
remember
it
quite
well
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
as
a
miner
relentlessly
pursuing
her
underground
labours
she
has
other
matters
to
occupy
her
mind
could
our
own
memory
always
vie
with
hers
it
is
very
doubtful
allow
the
red
ant
the
same
sort
of
memory
and
her
peregrinations
her
returns
to
the
nest
by
the
same
road
are
no
longer
difficult
to
explain
tests
of
this
kind
have
furnished
me
with
some
other
results
worthy
of
mention
when
convinced
by
untiring
explorations
that
her
prey
is
no
longer
on
the
tuft
where
she
laid
it
the
pompilus
as
we
were
saying
looks
for
it
in
the
neighbourhood
and
finds
it
pretty
easily
for
i
am
careful
to
put
it
in
an
exposed
place
let
us
increase
the
difficulty
to
some
extent
i
dig
the
tip
of
my
finger
into
the
ground
and
lay
the
spider
in
the
little
hole
thus
obtained
covering
her
with
a
tiny
leaf
now
the
wasp
while
in
quest
of
her
lost
prey
happens
to
walk
over
this
leaf
to
pass
it
again
and
again
without
suspecting
that
the
spider
lies
beneath
for
she
goes
and
continues
her
vain
search
farther
off
her
guide
therefore
is
not
scent
but
sight
nevertheless
she
is
constantly
feeling
the
ground
with
her
antennae
what
can
be
the
function
of
those
organs
i
do
not
know
although
i
assert
that
they
are
not
olfactory
organs
the
ammophila
in
search
of
her
grey
worm
had
already
led
me
to
make
the
same
assertion
i
now
obtain
an
experimental
proof
which
seems
to
me
decisive
i
would
add
that
the
pompilus
has
very
short
sight
often
she
passes
within
a
couple
of
inches
of
her
spider
without
seeing
her
chapter
some
reflections
upon
insect
psychology
the
laudator
temperis
acti
is
out
of
favour
just
now
the
world
is
on
the
move
yes
but
sometimes
it
moves
backwards
when
i
was
a
boy
our
twopenny
textbooks
told
us
that
man
was
a
reasoning
animal
nowadays
there
are
learned
volumes
to
prove
to
us
that
human
reason
is
but
a
higher
rung
in
the
ladder
whose
foot
reaches
down
to
the
bottommost
depths
of
animal
life
there
is
the
greater
and
the
lesser
there
are
all
the
intermediary
rounds
but
nowhere
does
it
break
off
and
start
afresh
it
begins
with
zero
in
the
glair
of
a
cell
and
ascends
until
we
come
to
the
mighty
brain
of
a
newton
the
noble
faculty
of
which
we
were
so
proud
is
a
zoological
attribute
all
have
a
larger
or
smaller
share
of
it
from
the
live
atom
to
the
anthropoid
ape
that
hideous
caricature
of
man
it
always
struck
me
that
those
who
held
this
levelling
theory
made
facts
say
more
than
they
really
meant
it
struck
me
that
in
order
to
obtain
their
plain
they
were
lowering
the
man
and
elevating
the
valley
the
animal
now
this
levelling
of
theirs
needed
proofs
to
my
mind
and
as
i
found
none
in
their
books
or
at
any
rate
only
doubtful
and
highly
debatable
ones
i
did
my
own
observing
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
definite
conviction
i
sought
i
experimented
to
speak
with
any
certainty
it
behoves
us
not
to
go
beyond
what
we
really
know
i
am
beginning
to
have
a
passable
acquaintance
with
insects
after
spending
some
forty
years
in
their
company
let
us
question
the
insect
then
not
the
first
that
comes
along
but
the
most
gifted
the
hymenopteron
i
am
giving
my
opponents
every
advantage
where
will
they
find
a
creature
more
richly
endowed
with
talent
it
would
seem
as
though
in
creating
it
nature
had
delighted
in
bestowing
the
greatest
amount
of
industry
upon
the
smallest
body
of
matter
can
the
bird
wonderful
architect
that
it
is
compare
its
work
with
that
masterpiece
of
higher
geometry
the
edifice
of
the
bee
the
hymenopteron
rivals
man
himself
we
build
towns
the
bee
erects
cities
we
have
servants
the
ant
has
hers
we
rear
domestic
animals
she
rears
her
insects
we
herd
cattle
she
herds
her
the
aphides
we
have
abolished
slavery
whereas
she
continues
her
well
does
this
superior
this
privileged
being
reason
reader
do
not
smile
this
is
a
most
serious
matter
well
worthy
of
our
consideration
to
devote
our
attention
to
animals
is
to
plunge
at
once
into
the
vexed
question
of
who
we
are
and
whence
we
come
what
then
passes
in
that
little
hymenopteron
brain
has
it
faculties
akin
to
ours
has
it
the
power
of
thought
what
a
problem
if
we
could
only
solve
it
what
a
chapter
of
psychology
if
we
could
only
write
it
but
at
our
very
first
questionings
the
mysterious
will
rise
up
impenetrable
we
may
be
convinced
of
that
we
are
incapable
of
knowing
ourselves
what
will
it
be
if
we
try
to
fathom
the
intellect
of
others
let
us
be
content
if
we
succeed
in
gleaning
a
few
grains
of
truth
what
is
reason
philosophy
would
give
us
learned
definitions
let
us
be
modest
and
keep
to
the
simplest
we
are
only
treating
of
animals
reason
is
the
faculty
that
connects
the
effect
with
its
cause
and
directs
the
act
by
conforming
it
to
the
needs
of
the
accidental
within
these
limits
are
animals
capable
of
reasoning
are
they
able
to
connect
a
with
a
and
afterwards
to
regulate
their
behaviour
accordingly
are
they
able
to
change
their
line
of
conduct
when
faced
with
an
emergency
history
has
but
few
data
likely
to
be
of
use
to
us
here
and
those
which
we
find
scattered
in
various
authors
are
seldom
able
to
withstand
a
severe
examination
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
which
i
know
is
supplied
by
erasmus
darwin
in
his
book
entitled
zoonomia
it
tells
of
a
wasp
that
has
just
caught
and
killed
a
big
fly
the
wind
is
blowing
and
the
huntress
hampered
in
her
flight
by
the
great
area
presented
by
her
prize
alights
on
the
ground
to
amputate
the
abdomen
the
head
and
the
wings
she
flies
away
carrying
with
her
only
the
thorax
which
gives
less
hold
to
the
wind
if
we
keep
to
the
bald
facts
this
does
i
admit
give
a
semblance
of
reason
the
wasp
appears
to
grasp
the
relation
between
cause
and
effect
the
effect
is
the
resistance
experienced
in
the
flight
the
cause
is
the
dimensions
of
the
prey
contending
with
the
air
hence
the
logical
conclusion
those
dimensions
must
be
lessened
the
abdomen
the
head
and
above
all
the
wings
must
be
chopped
off
and
the
resistance
will
be
decreased
i
would
gladly
if
i
were
able
cancel
some
rather
hasty
lines
which
i
allowed
myself
to
pen
in
the
first
volume
of
these
souvenirs
but
scripta
manent
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
make
amends
now
in
this
note
for
the
error
into
which
i
fell
relying
on
lacordaire
who
quotes
this
instance
from
erasmus
darwin
in
his
own
introduction
a
i
believed
that
a
sphex
was
given
as
the
heroine
of
the
story
how
could
i
do
otherwise
not
having
the
original
text
in
front
of
me
how
could
i
suspect
that
an
entomologist
of
lacordaire
standing
should
be
capable
of
such
a
blunder
as
to
substitute
a
sphex
for
a
common
wasp
great
was
my
perplexity
in
the
face
of
this
evidence
a
sphex
capturing
a
fly
was
an
impossibility
and
i
blamed
the
british
scientist
accordingly
but
what
insect
was
it
that
erasmus
darwin
saw
calling
logic
to
my
aid
i
declared
that
it
was
a
wasp
and
i
could
not
have
hit
the
mark
more
truly
charles
darwin
in
fact
informed
me
afterwards
that
his
grandfather
wrote
wasp
in
his
zoonomia
though
the
correction
did
credit
to
my
intelligence
i
none
the
less
deeply
regretted
my
mistake
for
i
had
uttered
suspicions
of
the
observer
powers
of
discernment
unjust
suspicions
which
the
translator
inaccuracy
led
me
into
entertaining
may
this
note
serve
to
mitigate
the
harshness
of
the
strictures
provoked
by
my
overtaxed
credulity
i
do
not
scruple
to
attack
ideas
which
i
consider
false
but
heaven
forfend
that
i
should
ever
attack
those
who
uphold
them
author
note
but
does
this
concatenation
of
ideas
rudimentary
though
it
be
really
take
place
within
the
insect
brain
i
am
convinced
of
the
contrary
and
my
proofs
are
unanswerable
in
the
first
volume
of
these
souvenirs
cf
insect
life
chapter
translator
note
i
demonstrated
by
experiment
that
erasmus
darwin
wasp
was
but
obeying
her
instinct
which
is
to
cut
up
the
captured
game
and
to
keep
only
the
most
nourishing
part
the
thorax
whether
the
day
be
perfectly
calm
or
whether
the
wind
blow
whether
she
be
in
the
shelter
of
a
dense
thicket
or
in
the
open
i
see
the
wasp
proceed
to
separate
the
succulent
from
the
tough
i
see
her
reject
the
legs
the
wings
the
head
and
the
abdomen
retaining
only
the
breast
as
pap
for
her
larvae
then
what
value
has
this
dissection
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
the
when
the
wind
blows
it
has
no
value
at
all
for
it
would
take
place
just
the
same
in
absolutely
calm
weather
erasmus
darwin
jumped
too
quickly
to
his
conclusion
which
was
the
outcome
of
his
mental
bias
and
not
of
the
logic
of
things
if
he
had
first
enquired
into
the
wasp
habits
he
would
not
have
brought
forward
as
a
serious
argument
an
incident
which
had
no
connection
with
the
important
question
of
animal
reason
i
have
reverted
to
this
case
to
show
the
difficulties
that
beset
the
man
who
confines
himself
to
casual
observations
however
carefully
carried
out
one
should
never
rely
upon
a
lucky
chance
which
may
not
occur
again
we
must
multiply
our
observations
check
them
one
with
the
other
we
must
create
incidents
looking
into
preceding
ones
finding
out
succeeding
ones
and
working
out
the
relation
between
them
all
then
and
not
till
then
with
extreme
caution
are
we
entitled
to
express
a
few
views
worthy
of
credence
nowhere
do
i
find
data
collected
under
such
conditions
for
which
reason
however
much
i
might
wish
it
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
bring
the
evidence
of
others
in
support
of
the
few
conclusions
which
i
myself
have
formed
my
with
their
nests
hanging
on
the
walls
of
the
arch
which
i
have
mentioned
lent
themselves
to
continuous
experiment
better
than
any
other
hymenopteron
i
had
them
there
at
my
house
under
my
eyes
at
all
hours
of
the
day
as
long
as
i
wished
i
was
free
to
follow
their
actions
in
full
detail
and
to
carry
out
successfully
any
experiment
however
long
moreover
their
numbers
allowed
me
to
repeat
my
attempts
until
i
was
perfectly
convinced
the
therefore
shall
supply
me
with
the
materials
for
this
chapter
also
a
few
words
before
i
begin
about
the
works
the
of
the
sheds
utilizes
first
of
all
the
old
galleries
of
the
clay
nest
a
part
of
which
she
abandons
to
two
osmiae
her
free
tenants
the
osmia
and
latreille
osmia
these
old
corridors
which
save
labour
are
in
great
demand
but
there
are
not
many
vacant
as
the
more
precocious
osmiae
have
already
taken
possession
of
most
of
them
and
therefore
the
building
of
new
cells
soon
begins
these
cells
are
cemented
to
the
surface
of
the
nest
which
thus
increases
in
thickness
every
year
the
edifice
of
cells
is
not
built
all
at
once
mortar
and
honey
alternate
repeatedly
the
masonry
starts
with
a
sort
of
little
swallow
nest
a
or
thimble
whose
circumference
is
completed
by
the
wall
against
which
it
rests
picture
the
cup
of
an
acorn
cut
in
two
and
stuck
to
the
surface
of
the
nest
there
you
have
the
receptacle
in
a
stage
sufficiently
advanced
to
take
a
first
instalment
of
honey
the
bee
thereupon
leaves
the
mortar
and
busies
herself
with
harvesting
after
a
few
the
work
of
building
is
resumed
and
some
new
rows
of
bricks
raise
the
edge
of
the
basin
which
becomes
capable
of
receiving
a
larger
stock
of
provisions
then
comes
another
change
of
business
the
mason
once
more
becomes
a
harvester
a
little
later
the
harvester
is
again
a
mason
and
these
alternations
continue
until
the
cell
is
of
the
regulation
height
and
holds
the
amount
of
honey
required
for
the
larva
food
thus
come
turn
and
turn
about
more
or
less
numerous
according
to
the
occupation
in
hand
journeys
to
the
dry
and
barren
path
where
the
cement
is
gathered
and
mixed
and
journeys
to
the
flowers
where
the
bee
crop
is
crammed
with
honey
and
her
belly
powdered
with
pollen
at
last
comes
the
time
for
laying
we
see
the
bee
arrive
with
a
pellet
of
mortar
she
gives
a
glance
at
the
cell
to
enquire
if
everything
is
in
order
she
inserts
her
abdomen
and
the
egg
is
laid
then
and
there
the
mother
seals
up
the
home
with
her
pellet
of
cement
she
closes
the
orifice
and
manages
so
well
with
the
material
that
the
lid
receives
its
permanent
form
at
this
first
sitting
it
has
only
to
be
thickened
and
strengthened
with
fresh
layers
a
work
which
is
less
urgent
and
will
be
done
by
and
by
what
does
appear
to
be
an
urgent
necessity
is
the
closing
of
the
cell
immediately
after
the
egg
has
been
religiously
deposited
therein
so
that
there
may
be
no
danger
from
visitors
during
the
mother
absence
the
bee
must
have
serious
reasons
for
thus
hurrying
on
the
closing
of
the
cell
what
would
happen
if
after
laying
her
egg
she
left
the
house
open
and
went
to
the
to
fetch
the
wherewithal
to
block
the
door
some
thief
might
drop
in
and
substitute
her
own
egg
for
the
we
shall
see
that
our
suspicions
are
not
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
mason
never
lays
without
having
in
her
mandibles
the
pellet
of
mortar
required
for
the
immediate
construction
of
the
lid
of
the
nest
the
precious
egg
must
not
for
a
single
instant
remain
exposed
to
the
cupidity
of
marauders
to
these
particulars
i
will
add
a
few
general
observations
which
will
make
what
follows
easier
to
understand
so
long
as
its
circumstances
are
normal
the
insect
actions
are
calculated
most
rationally
in
view
of
the
object
to
be
attained
what
could
be
more
logical
for
instance
than
the
devices
employed
by
the
hunting
wasp
when
paralysing
her
prey
cf
insect
life
chapters
to
and
to
translator
note
so
that
it
may
keep
fresh
for
her
larva
while
in
no
wise
imperilling
that
larva
safety
it
is
preeminently
rational
we
ourselves
could
think
of
nothing
better
and
yet
the
wasp
action
is
not
prompted
by
reason
if
she
thought
out
her
surgery
she
would
be
our
superior
it
will
never
occur
to
anybody
that
the
creature
is
able
in
the
smallest
degree
to
account
for
its
skilful
vivisections
therefore
so
long
as
it
does
not
depart
from
the
path
mapped
out
for
it
the
insect
can
perform
the
most
sagacious
actions
without
entitling
us
in
the
least
to
attribute
these
to
the
dictates
of
reason
what
would
happen
in
an
emergency
here
we
must
distinguish
carefully
between
two
classes
of
emergency
or
we
shall
be
liable
to
grievous
error
first
in
accidents
occurring
in
the
course
of
the
occupation
at
the
moment
in
these
circumstances
the
creature
is
capable
of
remedying
the
accident
it
continues
under
a
similar
form
its
actual
task
it
remains
in
short
in
the
same
psychic
condition
in
the
second
case
the
accident
is
connected
with
a
more
remote
occupation
it
relates
to
a
completed
task
with
which
under
normal
conditions
the
insect
is
no
longer
concerned
to
meet
this
emergency
the
creature
would
have
to
retrace
its
psychic
course
it
would
have
to
do
all
over
again
what
it
has
just
finished
before
turning
its
attention
to
anything
else
is
the
insect
capable
of
this
will
it
be
able
to
leave
the
present
and
return
to
the
past
will
it
decide
to
hark
back
to
a
task
that
is
much
more
pressing
than
the
one
on
which
it
was
engaged
if
it
did
all
this
then
we
should
really
have
evidence
of
a
modicum
of
reason
the
question
shall
be
settled
by
experiment
we
will
begin
by
taking
a
few
incidents
that
come
under
the
first
heading
a
has
finished
the
initial
layer
of
the
covering
of
the
cell
she
has
gone
in
search
of
a
second
pellet
of
mortar
wherewith
to
strengthen
her
work
in
her
absence
i
prick
the
lid
with
a
needle
and
widen
the
hole
thus
made
until
it
is
half
the
size
of
the
opening
the
insect
returns
and
repairs
the
damage
it
was
originally
engaged
on
the
lid
and
is
merely
continuing
its
work
in
mending
that
lid
a
second
is
still
at
her
first
row
of
bricks
the
cell
as
yet
is
no
more
than
a
shallow
cup
containing
no
provisions
i
make
a
big
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
cup
and
the
bee
hastens
to
stop
the
breach
she
was
busy
building
and
turned
aside
a
moment
to
do
more
building
her
repairs
are
the
continuation
of
the
work
on
which
she
was
engaged
a
third
has
laid
her
egg
and
closed
the
cell
while
she
is
gone
in
search
of
a
fresh
supply
of
cement
to
strengthen
the
door
i
make
a
large
aperture
immediately
below
the
lid
too
high
up
to
allow
the
honey
to
escape
the
insect
on
arriving
with
its
mortar
intended
for
a
different
task
sees
its
broken
jar
and
soon
puts
the
damage
right
i
have
rarely
witnessed
such
a
sensible
performance
nevertheless
all
things
considered
let
us
not
be
too
lavish
of
our
praises
the
insect
was
busy
closing
up
on
its
return
it
sees
a
crack
representing
in
its
eyes
a
bad
join
which
it
had
overlooked
it
completes
its
actual
task
by
improving
the
join
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
these
three
instances
which
i
select
from
a
large
number
of
others
more
or
less
similar
is
that
the
insect
is
able
to
cope
with
emergencies
provided
that
the
new
action
be
not
outside
the
course
of
its
actual
work
at
the
moment
shall
we
say
then
that
reason
directs
it
why
should
we
the
insect
persists
in
the
same
psychic
course
it
continues
its
action
it
does
what
it
was
doing
before
it
corrects
what
to
it
appears
but
a
careless
flaw
in
the
work
of
the
moment
here
moreover
is
something
which
would
change
our
estimate
entirely
if
it
ever
occurred
to
us
to
look
upon
these
repaired
breaches
as
a
work
dictated
by
reason
let
us
turn
to
the
second
class
of
emergency
referred
to
above
let
us
imagine
first
cells
similar
to
those
in
the
second
experiment
that
is
to
say
only
in
the
form
of
a
shallow
cup
but
already
containing
honey
i
make
a
hole
in
the
bottom
through
which
the
provisions
ooze
and
run
to
waste
their
owners
are
harvesting
let
us
imagine
on
the
other
hand
cells
very
nearly
finished
and
almost
completely
provisioned
i
perforate
the
bottom
in
the
same
way
and
let
out
the
honey
which
drips
through
gradually
the
owners
of
these
are
building
judging
by
what
has
gone
before
the
reader
will
perhaps
expect
to
see
immediate
repairs
urgent
repairs
for
the
safety
of
the
future
larva
is
at
stake
let
him
dismiss
any
such
illusion
more
and
more
journeys
are
undertaken
now
in
quest
of
food
now
in
quest
of
mortar
but
not
one
of
the
troubles
about
the
disastrous
breach
the
harvester
goes
on
harvesting
the
busy
bricklayer
proceeds
with
her
next
row
of
bricks
as
though
nothing
out
of
the
way
had
happened
lastly
if
the
injured
cells
are
high
enough
and
contain
enough
provisions
the
bee
lays
her
eggs
puts
a
door
to
the
house
and
passes
on
to
another
house
without
doing
aught
to
remedy
the
leakage
of
the
honey
two
or
three
days
later
those
cells
have
lost
all
their
contents
which
now
form
a
long
trail
on
the
surface
of
the
nest
is
it
through
lack
of
intelligence
that
the
bee
allows
her
honey
to
go
to
waste
may
it
not
rather
be
through
helplessness
it
might
happen
that
the
sort
of
mortar
which
the
mason
has
at
her
disposal
will
not
set
on
the
edges
of
a
hole
that
is
sticky
with
honey
the
honey
may
prevent
the
cement
from
adjusting
itself
to
the
orifice
in
which
case
the
insect
inertness
would
merely
be
resignation
to
an
irreparable
evil
let
us
look
into
the
matter
before
drawing
inferences
with
my
forceps
i
deprive
the
bee
of
her
pellet
of
mortar
and
apply
it
to
the
hole
whence
the
honey
is
escaping
my
attempt
at
repairing
meets
with
the
fullest
success
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
compete
with
the
mason
in
dexterity
for
a
piece
of
work
done
by
a
man
hand
it
is
quite
creditable
my
dab
of
mortar
fits
nicely
into
the
mutilated
wall
it
hardens
as
usual
and
the
escape
of
honey
ceases
this
is
quite
satisfactory
what
would
it
be
had
the
work
been
done
by
the
insect
equipped
with
its
tools
of
exquisite
precision
when
the
refrains
therefore
this
is
not
due
to
helplessness
on
her
part
nor
to
any
defect
in
the
material
employed
another
objection
presents
itself
we
are
going
too
far
perhaps
in
admitting
this
concatenation
of
ideas
in
the
insect
mind
in
expecting
it
to
argue
that
the
honey
is
running
away
because
the
cell
has
a
hole
in
it
and
that
to
save
it
from
being
wasted
the
hole
must
be
stopped
so
much
logic
perhaps
exceeds
the
powers
of
its
poor
little
brain
then
again
the
hole
is
not
seen
it
is
hidden
by
the
honey
trickling
through
the
cause
of
that
stream
of
honey
is
an
unknown
cause
and
to
trace
the
loss
of
the
liquid
home
to
that
cause
to
the
hole
in
the
receptacle
is
too
lofty
a
piece
of
reasoning
for
the
insect
a
cell
in
the
rudimentary
and
containing
no
provisions
has
a
hole
three
or
four
millimetres
translator
note
wide
made
in
it
at
the
bottom
a
few
moments
later
this
orifice
is
stopped
by
the
mason
we
have
already
witnessed
a
similar
patching
the
insect
having
finished
starts
foraging
i
reopen
the
hole
at
the
same
place
the
pollen
runs
through
the
aperture
and
falls
to
the
ground
as
the
bee
is
rubbing
off
her
first
load
in
the
cell
the
damage
is
undoubtedly
observed
when
plunging
her
head
into
the
cup
to
take
stock
of
what
she
has
stored
the
bee
puts
her
antennae
into
the
artificial
hole
she
sounds
it
she
explores
it
she
can
not
fail
to
perceive
it
i
see
the
two
feelers
quivering
outside
the
hole
the
insect
notices
the
breach
in
the
wall
that
is
certain
it
flies
off
will
it
bring
back
mortar
from
its
present
journey
to
repair
the
injured
jar
as
it
did
just
now
not
at
all
it
returns
with
provisions
it
disgorges
its
honey
it
rubs
off
its
pollen
it
mixes
the
material
the
sticky
and
almost
solid
mass
fills
up
the
opening
and
oozes
through
with
difficulty
i
roll
a
spill
of
paper
and
free
the
hole
which
remains
open
and
shows
daylight
distinctly
in
both
directions
i
sweep
the
place
clear
over
and
over
again
whenever
this
becomes
necessary
because
new
provisions
are
brought
i
clean
the
opening
sometimes
in
the
bee
absence
sometimes
in
her
presence
while
she
is
busy
mixing
her
paste
the
unusual
happenings
in
the
warehouse
plundered
from
below
can
not
escape
her
any
more
than
the
breach
at
the
bottom
of
the
cell
nevertheless
for
three
consecutive
hours
i
witness
this
strange
sight
the
bee
full
of
active
zeal
for
the
task
in
hand
omits
to
plug
this
vessel
of
the
danaides
she
persists
in
trying
to
fill
her
cracked
receptacle
whence
the
provisions
disappear
as
soon
as
stored
away
she
constantly
alternates
between
builder
and
harvester
work
she
raises
the
edges
of
the
cell
with
fresh
rows
of
bricks
she
brings
provisions
which
i
continue
to
abstract
so
as
to
leave
the
breach
always
visible
she
makes
journeys
before
my
eyes
now
for
mortar
now
for
honey
and
not
once
does
she
bethink
herself
of
stopping
the
leakage
at
the
bottom
of
her
jar
at
five
in
the
evening
the
works
cease
they
are
resumed
on
the
morrow
this
time
i
neglect
to
clean
out
my
artificial
orifice
and
leave
the
victuals
gradually
to
ooze
out
by
themselves
at
length
the
egg
is
laid
and
the
door
sealed
up
without
anything
being
done
by
the
bee
in
the
matter
of
the
disastrous
breach
and
yet
to
plug
the
hole
were
an
easy
matter
for
her
a
pellet
of
her
mortar
would
suffice
besides
while
the
cup
was
still
empty
did
she
not
instantly
close
the
hole
which
i
had
made
why
are
not
those
early
repairs
of
hers
repeated
it
clearly
shows
the
creature
inability
to
retrace
the
course
of
its
actions
however
slightly
at
the
time
of
the
first
breach
the
cup
was
empty
and
the
insect
was
laying
the
first
rows
of
bricks
the
accident
produced
through
my
agency
concerned
the
part
of
the
work
which
occupied
the
bee
at
the
actual
moment
it
was
a
flaw
in
the
building
such
as
can
occur
naturally
in
new
courses
of
masonry
which
have
not
had
time
to
harden
in
correcting
that
flaw
the
mason
did
not
go
outside
her
usual
work
but
once
the
provisioning
begins
the
cup
is
finished
for
good
and
all
and
come
what
may
the
insect
will
not
touch
it
again
the
harvester
will
go
on
harvesting
though
the
pollen
trickle
to
the
ground
through
the
drain
to
plug
the
hole
would
imply
a
change
of
occupation
of
which
the
insect
is
incapable
for
the
moment
it
is
the
honey
turn
and
not
the
mortar
the
rule
upon
this
point
is
invariable
a
moment
comes
presently
when
the
harvesting
is
interrupted
and
the
masoning
resumed
the
edifice
must
be
raised
a
storey
higher
will
the
bee
once
more
a
builder
mixing
fresh
cement
now
attend
to
the
leakage
at
the
bottom
no
more
than
before
what
occupies
her
at
present
is
the
new
floor
whose
brickwork
would
be
repaired
at
once
if
it
sustained
a
damage
but
the
bottom
storey
is
too
old
a
part
of
the
business
it
is
ancient
history
and
the
worker
will
not
put
a
further
touch
to
it
even
though
it
be
in
serious
danger
for
the
rest
the
present
and
the
following
storeys
will
all
have
the
same
fate
carefully
watched
by
the
insect
as
long
as
they
are
in
process
of
building
they
are
forgotten
and
allowed
to
go
to
ruin
once
they
are
actually
built
here
is
a
striking
instance
in
a
cell
which
has
attained
its
full
height
i
make
a
window
almost
as
large
as
the
natural
opening
and
place
it
about
up
above
the
honey
the
bee
brings
provisions
for
some
time
longer
and
then
lays
her
egg
through
my
big
window
i
see
the
egg
deposited
on
the
victuals
the
insect
next
works
at
the
cover
to
which
it
gives
the
finishing
touches
with
a
series
of
little
taps
administered
with
infinite
care
while
the
breach
remains
yawning
on
the
lid
it
scrupulously
stops
up
every
pore
that
could
admit
so
much
as
an
atom
but
it
leaves
the
great
opening
that
places
the
house
at
the
mercy
of
the
it
goes
to
that
breach
repeatedly
puts
in
its
head
examines
it
explores
it
with
its
antennae
nibbles
the
edges
of
it
and
that
is
all
the
mutilated
cell
shall
stay
as
it
is
with
never
a
dab
of
mortar
the
threatened
part
dates
too
far
back
for
the
bee
to
think
of
troubling
about
it
i
have
said
enough
i
think
to
show
the
insect
mental
incapacity
in
the
presence
of
the
accidental
this
incapacity
is
confirmed
by
renewing
the
test
an
essential
condition
of
all
good
experiments
therefore
my
notes
are
full
of
examples
similar
to
the
one
which
i
have
just
described
to
relate
them
would
be
mere
repetition
i
pass
them
over
for
the
sake
of
brevity
the
renewal
of
a
test
is
not
sufficient
we
must
also
vary
our
test
let
us
then
examine
the
insect
intelligence
from
another
point
of
view
that
of
the
introduction
of
foreign
bodies
into
the
cell
the
is
a
housekeeper
of
scrupulous
cleanliness
as
indeed
are
all
the
hymenoptera
not
a
spot
of
dirt
is
suffered
in
her
not
a
grain
of
dust
is
permitted
on
the
surface
of
her
mixture
and
yet
while
the
jar
is
open
the
precious
is
exposed
to
accidents
the
workers
in
the
cells
above
may
inadvertently
drop
a
little
mortar
into
the
lower
cells
the
owner
herself
when
working
at
enlarging
the
jar
runs
the
risk
of
letting
a
speck
of
cement
fall
into
the
provisions
a
gnat
attracted
by
the
smell
may
come
and
be
caught
in
the
honey
brawls
between
neighbours
who
are
getting
into
each
other
way
may
send
some
dust
flying
thither
all
this
refuse
has
to
disappear
and
that
quickly
lest
afterwards
the
larva
should
find
coarse
fare
under
its
delicate
mandibles
therefore
the
must
be
able
to
cleanse
the
cell
of
any
foreign
body
and
in
point
of
fact
they
are
well
able
to
do
so
i
place
on
the
surface
of
the
honey
five
or
six
bits
of
straw
a
millimetre
in
length
translator
note
great
astonishment
on
the
part
of
the
returning
insect
never
before
have
so
many
sweepings
accumulated
in
its
warehouse
the
bee
picks
out
the
bits
of
straw
one
by
one
to
the
very
last
and
each
time
goes
and
gets
rid
of
them
at
a
distance
the
effort
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
work
i
see
the
bee
soar
above
the
nearest
to
a
height
of
thirty
feet
and
fly
away
beyond
it
to
rid
herself
of
her
burden
a
mere
atom
she
fears
lest
she
should
litter
the
place
by
dropping
her
bit
of
straw
on
the
ground
under
the
nest
a
thing
like
that
must
be
carried
very
far
away
i
place
upon
the
a
egg
which
i
myself
saw
laid
in
an
adjacent
cell
the
bee
picks
it
out
and
throws
it
away
at
a
distance
as
she
did
with
the
straws
just
now
there
are
two
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
this
both
extremely
interesting
in
the
first
place
that
precious
egg
for
whose
future
the
bee
labours
so
indefatigably
becomes
a
valueless
cumbersome
hateful
thing
when
it
belongs
to
another
her
own
egg
is
everything
the
egg
of
her
next
door
neighbour
is
nothing
it
is
flung
on
the
like
any
bit
of
rubbish
the
individual
so
zealous
on
behalf
of
her
family
displays
an
abominable
indifference
for
the
rest
of
her
kind
each
one
for
himself
in
the
second
place
i
ask
myself
without
as
yet
being
able
to
find
an
answer
to
my
question
how
certain
parasites
go
to
work
to
give
their
larva
the
benefit
of
the
provisions
accumulated
by
the
if
they
decide
to
lay
their
egg
on
the
victuals
in
the
open
cell
the
bee
when
she
sees
it
will
not
fail
to
cast
it
out
if
they
decide
to
lay
after
the
owner
they
can
not
do
so
for
she
blocks
up
the
door
as
soon
as
her
laying
is
done
this
curious
problem
must
be
reserved
for
future
investigation
cf
the
life
of
the
fly
chapters
to
also
later
chapters
in
the
present
translator
note
lastly
i
stick
into
the
paste
a
bit
of
straw
nearly
an
inch
long
and
standing
well
out
above
the
rim
of
the
cell
the
insect
extracts
it
by
dint
of
great
efforts
dragging
it
away
from
one
side
or
else
with
the
help
of
its
wings
it
drags
it
from
above
it
darts
away
with
the
straw
and
gets
rid
of
it
at
a
distance
after
flying
over
the
this
is
where
things
begin
to
get
complicated
i
have
said
that
when
the
time
comes
for
laying
the
arrives
with
a
pellet
of
mortar
wherewith
immediately
to
make
a
door
to
the
house
the
insect
with
its
front
legs
resting
on
the
rim
inserts
its
abdomen
in
the
cell
it
has
the
mortar
ready
in
its
mouth
having
laid
the
egg
it
comes
out
and
turns
round
to
block
the
door
i
wave
it
away
for
a
second
at
the
same
time
planting
my
straw
as
before
a
straw
sticking
out
nearly
a
centimetre
translator
note
what
will
the
bee
do
will
she
who
is
scrupulous
in
ridding
the
home
of
the
least
mote
of
dust
extract
this
beam
which
would
certainly
prove
the
larva
undoing
by
interfering
with
its
growth
she
could
for
just
now
we
saw
her
drag
out
and
throw
away
at
a
distance
a
similar
beam
she
could
and
she
does
she
closes
the
cell
cements
the
lid
seals
up
the
straw
in
the
thickness
of
the
mortar
more
journeys
are
taken
not
a
few
in
search
of
the
cement
required
to
strengthen
the
cover
each
time
the
mason
applies
the
material
with
the
most
minute
care
while
giving
the
straw
not
a
thought
in
this
way
i
obtain
one
after
the
other
eight
closed
cells
whose
lids
are
surmounted
by
my
mast
a
bit
of
protruding
straw
what
evidence
of
obtuse
intelligence
this
result
is
deserving
of
attentive
consideration
at
the
moment
when
i
am
inserting
my
beam
the
insect
has
its
mandibles
engaged
they
are
holding
the
pellet
of
mortar
intended
for
the
as
the
is
not
free
the
extraction
does
not
take
place
i
expected
to
see
the
bee
relinquish
her
mortar
and
then
proceed
to
remove
the
encumbrance
a
dab
of
mortar
more
or
less
is
not
a
serious
business
i
had
already
noticed
that
it
takes
my
a
journey
of
three
or
four
minutes
to
collect
one
the
last
longer
a
matter
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
to
drop
her
pellet
grab
the
straw
with
her
mandibles
now
disengaged
remove
it
and
gather
a
fresh
supply
of
cement
would
entail
a
loss
of
five
minutes
at
most
the
bee
decides
differently
she
will
not
she
can
not
relinquish
her
pellet
and
she
uses
it
no
matter
that
the
larva
will
perish
by
this
untimely
trowelling
the
moment
has
come
to
wall
up
the
door
the
door
is
walled
up
once
the
mandibles
are
free
the
extraction
could
be
attempted
at
the
risk
of
wrecking
the
lid
but
the
bee
does
nothing
of
the
sort
she
keeps
on
fetching
mortar
and
the
lid
is
religiously
finished
we
might
go
on
to
say
that
if
the
bee
were
obliged
to
depart
in
quest
of
fresh
mortar
after
dropping
the
first
to
withdraw
the
straw
she
would
leave
the
egg
unguarded
and
that
this
would
be
an
extreme
measure
which
the
mother
can
not
bring
herself
to
adopt
then
why
does
she
not
place
the
pellet
on
the
rim
of
the
cell
the
mandibles
now
free
would
remove
the
beam
the
pellet
would
be
taken
up
again
at
once
and
everything
would
go
to
perfection
but
no
the
insect
has
its
mortar
and
come
what
may
employs
it
on
the
work
for
which
it
was
intended
if
any
one
sees
a
rudiment
of
reason
in
this
hymenopteron
intelligence
he
has
eyes
that
are
more
penetrating
than
mine
i
see
nothing
in
it
all
but
an
invincible
persistence
in
the
act
once
begun
the
cogs
have
gripped
and
the
rest
of
the
wheels
must
follow
the
mandibles
are
fastened
on
the
pellet
of
mortar
and
the
idea
the
wish
to
unfasten
them
will
never
occur
to
the
insect
until
the
pellet
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
here
is
a
still
greater
absurdity
the
plugging
once
begun
is
very
carefully
finished
with
fresh
relays
of
mortar
exquisite
attention
is
paid
to
a
which
is
henceforth
useless
no
attention
at
all
to
the
dangerous
beam
o
little
gleams
of
reason
that
are
said
to
enlighten
the
animal
you
are
very
near
the
darkness
you
are
naught
another
and
still
more
eloquent
fact
will
finally
convince
whoso
may
yet
be
doubting
the
ration
of
honey
stored
up
in
a
cell
is
evidently
measured
by
the
needs
of
the
coming
larva
there
is
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
how
does
the
bee
know
when
the
proper
quantity
is
reached
the
cells
are
more
or
less
constant
in
dimension
but
they
are
not
filled
completely
only
to
about
of
their
height
a
large
space
is
therefore
left
empty
and
the
victualler
has
to
judge
of
the
moment
when
the
surface
of
the
mess
has
attained
the
right
level
the
honey
being
perfectly
opaque
its
depth
is
not
apparent
i
have
to
use
a
when
i
want
to
gauge
the
contents
of
the
jar
and
i
find
on
the
average
that
the
honey
reaches
a
depth
of
ten
millimetres
translator
note
the
bee
has
not
this
resource
she
has
sight
which
may
enable
her
to
estimate
the
full
section
from
the
empty
section
this
presupposes
the
possession
of
a
somewhat
geometric
eye
capable
of
measuring
the
third
of
a
distance
if
the
insect
did
it
by
euclid
that
would
be
very
brilliant
of
it
what
a
magnificent
proof
in
favour
of
its
little
intellect
a
chalicodoma
with
a
geometrician
eye
able
to
divide
a
straight
line
into
three
equal
parts

sometimes
two

the

is

the

she

within
her

prompts

go
on

grant
the

not

there
are
some
clad
in

so
extraordinarily
delicate
that
the

touch
rubs
it
off
they
are
fluffs
of
down
almost
as
frail
in
their
soft
elegance
as
the
crystalline
edifice
of
a
snowflake
before
it
touches
ground
they
are
called
bombylii
with
this
fragility
of
structure
is
combined
an
incomparable
power
of
flight
see
this
one
hovering
motionless
two
feet
above
the
ground
her
wings
vibrate
so
rapidly
that
they
appear
to
be
in
repose
the
insect
looks
as
though
it
were
hung
at
one
point
in
space
by
some
invisible
thread
you
make
a
movement
and
the
bombylius
has
disappeared
you
cast
your
eyes
in
search
of
her
around
you
far
away
judging
the
distance
by
the
vigour
of
her
flight
there
is
nothing
here
nothing
there
then
where
is
she
close
by
you
look
at
the
point
whence
she
started
the
bombylius
is
there
again
hovering
motionless
from
this
aerial
observatory
as
quickly
recovered
as
quitted
she
inspects
the
ground
watching
for
the
favourable
moment
to
establish
her
egg
at
the
cost
of
another

destruction
what
does
she
covet
for
her
offspring
the
the
stores
of
game
the
larvae
in
their
i
do
not
know
yet
what
i
do
know
is
that
her
slender
legs
and
her
dainty
velvet
dress
do
not
allow
her
to
make
underground
searches
when
she
has
found
the
propitious
place
suddenly
she
will
swoop
down
lay
her
egg
on
the
surface
in
that
lightning
touch
with
the
tip
of
her
abdomen
and
straightway
fly
up
again
what
i
suspect
for
reasons
set
forth
presently
is
that
the
grub
that
comes
out
of
the
bombylius
egg
must
of
its
own
motion
at
its
own
risk
and
peril
reach
the
victuals
which
the
mother
knows
to
be
close
at
hand
she
has
no
strength
to
do
more
and
it
is
for
the
grub
to
make
its
way
into
the
refectory
i
am
better
acquainted
with
the
manoeuvres
of
certain
tachinae
the
tiniest
of
flies
who
cowering
on
the

in
the
sun
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a

patiently
await
the
hour
at
which
to
strike
the
fell
blow
let
a

from
the
chase
with
her
a
philanthus
with
her
bee
a
cerceris
with
her
weevil
a
tachytes
with
her
locust
straightway
the
parasites
are
there
coming
and
going
turning
and
twisting
with
the
wasp
always
at
her
rear
without
allowing
themselves
to
be
put
off
by
any
cautious
feints
at
the
moment
when
the
huntress
goes
indoors
with
her
captured
game
between
her
legs
they
fling
themselves
on
her
prey
which
is
on
the
point
of
disappearing
underground
and
nimbly
lay
their
eggs
upon
it
the
thing
is
done
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
before
the
threshold
is
crossed
the
carcase
holds
the
germs
of
a
new
set
of
guests
who
will
feed
on
victuals
not
amassed
for
them
and
starve
the
children
of
the

to

smoked

wears

near
neighbour
in

official

but
though
the
soft
down
is
similar
in
fineness
it
is
very
different
in

it

reminding
us
of

the

and
these
are
the
only
instances
known
to
me
of
that
violent
opposition
of
dead
black

white
nowadays
when

interpret

is
considered
to
have
preserved
those
with
mimetic
powers
and
to
have
allowed
the
others
to
become
extinct
thus
gradually
converting
into
a
fixed
characteristic
what
at
first
was
but
a
casual
acquisition
the
lark
became
in
order
to
hide
himself
from
the
eyes
of
the
birds
of
prey
when
pecking
in
the
fields
the
common
lizard
adopted
a
tint
in
order
to
blend
with
the
foliage
of
the
thickets
in
which
he
lurks
the
guarded
against
the
bird
beak
by
taking
the
colour
of
the
plant
on
which
it
feeds
and
so
with
the
rest
in
my
callow
youth
these
comparisons
would
have
interested
me
i
was
just
ripe
for
that
kind
of
science
in
the
evenings
on
the
straw
of
the
we
used
to
talk
of
the
dragon
the
monster
which
to
inveigle
people
and
snap
them
up
with
greater
certainty
became
indistinguishable
from
a
rock
the
trunk
of
a
tree
a
bundle
of
twigs
since
those
happy
days
of
artless
credulity
scepticism
has
chilled
my
imagination
to
some
extent
by
way
of
a
parallel
with
the
three
examples
which
i
have
quoted
i
ask
myself
why
the
white
wagtail
who
seeks
his
food
in
the
furrows
as
does
the
lark
has
a
white
surmounted
by
a
magnificent
black
stock
this
dress
is
one
of
those
most
easily
picked
out
at
a
distance
against
the
rusty
colour
of
the
soil
whence
this
neglect
to
practise
mimesis
mimicry
he
has
every
need
of
it
poor
fellow
quite
as
much
as
his
companion
in
the
fields
why
is
the
eyed
lizard
of
provence
as
green
as
the
common
lizard
considering
that
he
shuns
verdure
and
chooses
as
his
haunt
in
the
bright
sunlight
some
chink
in
the
naked
rocks
where
not
so
much
as
a
tuft
of
moss
grows
if
to
capture
his
tiny
prey
his
brother
in
the
copses
and
the
hedges
thought
it
necessary
to
dissemble
and
consequently
to
dye
his
coat
how
comes
it
that
the
denizen
of
the
rocks
persists
in
his
colouring
which
at
once
betrays
him
against
the
stone
indifferent
to
mimicry
is
he
the
less
skilful
on
that
account
is
his
race
degenerating
i
have
studied
him
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
declare
with
positive
certainty
that
he
continues
to
thrive
both
in
numbers
and
in
vigour
why
has
the
adopted
for
its
dress
the
gaudiest
colours
and
those
which
contrast
most
with
the
green
of
the
leaves
which
it
frequents
why
does
it
flaunt
its
red
black
and
white
in
patches
clashing
violently
with
one
another
would
it
not
be
worth
its
while
to
follow
the
example
of
the
and
imitate
the
verdure
of
the
plant
that
feeds
it
has
it
no
enemies
of
course
it
has
which
of
us
animals

men
has
not
a
string
of
these
whys
could
be
extended
indefinitely
it
would
give
me
amusement
did
my
time
permit
me
to
counter
each
example
of
protective
mimicry
with
a
host
of
examples
to
the
contrary
what
manner
of
law
is
this
which
has
at

exceptions
in
a
hundred
cases
poor
human

there
is
a
deceptive
agreement
between
a
few
actual
facts
and
the
theory
which
we
are
so
foolishly
ready
to
believe
and
straightway
we
interpret
the
facts
in
the
light
of
the
theory
in
a

unknown
we
catch
a

worthy

thought
out
a
plan
for
gulling
his

by
identifying
himself
in

with
the

dwells

the

and
strategy
allowed

than

she
persists

to
the

note
astute
mimicry
is
even
more
necessary
when
the
one
to
be
duped
is
an
amphitryon
at
whose
cost
the
parasite
family
is
to
be
established
the
tachinae
seem
to
declare
as
much
they
are
grey
or
greyish
of
a
colour
as
undecided
as
the
dusty
soil
on
which
they
cower
while
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
huntress
laden
with
her
capture
but
they
dissemble
in
vain
the
bembex
the
philanthus
and
the
others
see
them
from
above
before
touching
ground
they
recognize
them
perfectly
at
a
distance
despite
their
grey
costume
and
so
they
hover
prudently
above
the
burrow
and
strive
by
sudden
feints
to
mislead
the
traitorous
little
fly
who
on
her
side
knows
her
business
too
well
to
allow
herself
to
be
enticed
away
or
to
leave
the
spot
where
the
other
is
bound
to
return
no
a
thousand
times
no
though
they
be
the
tachinae
have
no
better
chance
of
attaining
their
ends
than
a
host
of
other
parasites
whose
clothing
is
not
of
grey
frieze
to
match
the
locality
frequented
as
witness
the
glittering
chrysis
or
the
melecta
and
the
crocisa
with
their
white
spots
on
a
black
ground
we
are
also
told
that
the
better
to
cozen
his
amphitryon
the
parasite
adopts
more
or
less
the
same
shape
and
colouring
he
turns
himself
in
appearance
into
a
harmless
neighbour
a
worker
belonging
to
the
same
guild
instance
the
psithyrus
who
lives
at
the
expense
of
the
but
in
what
if
you
please
does
parnopes
carnea
resemble
the
bembex
into
whose
home
she
penetrates
in
her
presence
in
what
does
the
melecta
resemble
the
anthophora
who
stands
aside
on
her
threshold
to
let
her
pass
the
difference
of
costume
is
most
striking
the
melecta
deep
mourning
has
naught
in
common
with
the
russet
coat
the
parnopes
thorax
possesses
not
the
least
feature
of
resemblance
with
the
livery
of
the
bembex
and
this
chrysis
also
is
a
dwarf
in
comparison
with
the
ardent
nimrod
who
goes
hunting
besides
what
a
curious
idea
to
make
the
parasite
success
depend
upon
a
more
or
less
faithful
likeness
with
the
insect
to
be
robbed
why
the
imitation
would
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect
with
the
exception
of
the
social
bees
who
work
at
a
common
task
failure
would
be
certain
for
here
as
among
mankind
two
of
a
trade
never
agree
an
osmia
an
anthophora
a
chalicodoma
had
better
be
careful
not
to
poke
an
indiscreet
head
in
at
her
neighbour
door
a
sound
drubbing
would
soon
recall
her
to
a
sense
of
the
proprieties
she
might
easily
find
herself
with
a
dislocated
shoulder
or
a
mangled
leg
in
return
for
a
simple
visit
which
was
perhaps
prompted
by
no
evil
intention
each
for
herself
in
her
own
stronghold
but
let
a
parasite
appear
meditating
foul
play
a
very
different
thing
she
can
wear
the
trappings
of
harlequin
or
of
a
she
can
be
the
in
of
vermilion
with
blue
trimmings
or
the
with
a
red
scarf
across
her
black
abdomen
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
will
let
her
have
her
way
or
if
she
become
too
pressing
will
drive
her
off
with
a
mere
flick
of
her
wing
with
her
there
is
no
serious
fray
no
fierce
fight
the
bludgeon
is
reserved
for
the
friend
of
the
family
now
go
and
practice
your
mimesis
in
order
to
receive
a
welcome
from
the
anthophora
or
the
chalicodoma
a
few
hours
spent
with
the
insects
themselves
will
turn
any
one
into
a
hardened
scoffer
at
these
artless
theories
to
sum
up
mimesis
in
my
eyes
is
a
piece
of
childishness
were
i
not
anxious
to
remain
polite
i
should
say
that
it
is
sheer
stupidity
and
the
word
would
express
my
meaning
better
the
variety
of
combinations
in
the
domain
of
possible
things
is
infinite
it
is
undeniable
that
here
and
there
cases
occur
in
which
the
animal
harmonizes
with
surrounding
objects
it
would
even
be
very
strange
if
such
cases
were
excluded
from
actuality
since
everything
is
possible
but
these
rare
coincidences
are
faced
under
exactly
similar
conditions
by
inconsistencies
so
strongly
marked
and
so
numerous
that
having
frequency
on
their
side
they
ought
in
all
logic
to
serve
as
the
basis
of
the
law
here
one
fact
says
yes
there
a
thousand
facts
say
no
to
which
evidence
shall
we
lend
an
ear
if
we
only
wish
to
bolster
up
a
theory
it
would
be
prudent
to
listen
to
neither
the
how
and
why
escapes
us
what
we
dignify
with
the
pretentious
title
of
a
law
is
but
a
way
of
looking
at
things
with
our
mind
a
very
way
which
we
adopt
for
the
requirements
of
our
case
our
laws
contain
but
an
infinitesimal
shade
of
reality
often
indeed
they
are
but
puffed
out
with
vain
imaginings
such
is
the
law
of
mimesis
which
explains
the
green
grasshopper
by
the
green
leaves
in
which
this
locust
settles
and
is
silent
as
to
the
crioceris
that
beetle
who
lives
on
the
no
less
green
leaves
of
the
lily
and
it
is
not
only
a
mistaken
interpretation
it
is
a
clumsy
pitfall
in
which
novices
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
novices
did
i
say
the
greatest
experts
themselves
fall
into
the
trap
one
of
our
masters
of
entomology
did
me
the
honour
to
visit
my
laboratory
i
was
showing
my
collection
of
parasites
one
of
them
clad
in
black
and
yellow
attracted
his
attention
said
he
obviously
a
parasite
of
the
wasps
surprised
at
the
statement
i
interposed
what
signs
do
you
know
her
look
it
the
exact
colouring
of
the
wasp
a
mixture
of
black
and
yellow
it
is
a
most
striking
case
of
mimesis
so
nevertheless
our
friend
is
a
parasite
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
who
has
nothing
in
common
either
in
shape
or
colour
with
the
wasp
this
is
a
leucopsis
not
one
of
whom
enters
the
wasps
nest
mimesis
is
an
illusion
which
we
should
do
well
to
relegate
to
oblivion
and
with
the
evidence
a
whole
series
of
conclusive
examples
in
front
of
him
my
learned
visitor
admitted
with
a
good
grace
that
his
first
convictions
were
based
on
a
most
ludicrous
foundation
a
piece
of
advice
to
beginners
you
will
go
wrong
a
thousand
times
for
once
that
you
are
right
if
when
anxious
to
obtain
a
premature
sight
of
the
probable
habits
of
an
insect
you
take
mimesis
as
your
guide
with
mimesis
above
all
it
is
wise
when
the
law
says
that
a
thing
is
black
first
to
enquire
whether
it
does
not
happen
to
be
white
let
us
go
on
to
more
serious
subjects
and
enquire
into
parasitism
itself
without
troubling
any
longer
about
the
costume
of
the
parasite
according
to
etymology
a
parasite
is
one
who
eats
another
bread
one
who
lives
on
the
provisions
of
others
entomology
often
alters
this
term
from
its
real
meaning
thus
it
describes
as
parasites
the
chrysis
the
mutilla
the
anthrax
the
leucopsis
all
of
whom
feed
their
family
not
on
the
provisions
amassed
by
others
but
on
the
very
larvae
which
have
consumed
those
provisions
their
actual
property
when
the
tachinae
have
succeeded
in
laying
their
eggs
on
the
game
warehoused
by
the
bembex
the
burrower
home
is
invaded
by
real
parasites
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
around
the
heap
of
collected
solely
for
the
children
of
the
house
new
guests
force
their
way
numerous
and
hungry
and
without
the
least
ceremony
plunge
into
the
thick
of
it
they
sit
down
to
a
table
that
was
not
laid
for
them
they
eat
side
by
side
with
the
lawful
owner
and
this
in
such
haste
that
he
dies
of
starvation
though
he
is
respected
by
the
teeth
of
the
interlopers
who
have
gorged
themselves
on
his
portion
when
the
melecta
has
substituted
her
egg
for
the
anthophora
here
again
we
see
a
real
parasite
settling
in
the
usurped
cell
the
pile
of
honey
laboriously
gathered
by
the
mother
will
not
even
be
broken
in
upon
by
the
nurseling
for
which
it
was
intended
another
will
profit
by
it
with
none
to
say
him
nay
tachinae
and
melectae
those
are
the
true
parasites
consumers
of
others
goods
can
we
say
as
much
of
the
chrysis
or
the
mutilla
in
no
wise
the
scoliae
whose
habits
are
known
to
us
are
certainly
not
parasites
the
habits
of
the
have
been
described
in
different
essays
not
yet
translated
into
translator
note
no
one
will
accuse
them
of
stealing
the
food
of
others
zealous
workers
they
seek
and
find
under
ground
the
fat
grubs
on
which
their
family
will
feed
they
follow
the
chase
by
virtue
of
the
same
quality
as
the
most
renowned
hunters
cerceris
sphex
or
ammophila
only
instead
of
removing
the
game
to
a
special
lair
they
leave
it
where
it
is
down
in
the
burrow
homeless
poachers
they
let
their
venison
be
consumed
on
the
spot
where
it
is
caught
in
what
respect
do
the
mutilla
the
chrysis
the
leucopsis
the
anthrax
and
so
many
others
differ
in
their
way
of
living
from
the
scolia
it
seems
to
me
in
none
see
for
yourselves
by
an
artifice
that
varies
according
to
the
mother
talent
their
grubs
either
in
the
or
are
brought
into
touch
with
the
victim
that
is
to
feed
them
an
unwounded
victim
for
most
of
them
are
without
a
sting
a
live
victim
but
steeped
in
the
torpor
of
the
coming
transformations
and
thus
delivered
without
defence
to
the
grub
that
is
to
devour
it
with
them
as
with
the
scoliae
meals
are
made
on
the
spot
on
game
legitimately
acquired
by
indefatigable
battues
or
by
patient
stalking
in
which
all
the
rules
have
been
observed
only
the
animal
hunted
is
defenceless
and
does
not
need
to
be
laid
low
with
a
to
seek
and
find
for
one
larder
a
torpid
prey
incapable
of
resistance
is
if
you
like
less
meritorious
than
heroically
to
stab
the

but
since
when
has
the
title
of
sportsman
been
denied
to
him
who
blows
out
the
brains
of
a
harmless
rabbit
instead
of
waiting
without

for
the
furious
charge
of
the
wild
boar
and
driving
his

him
behind
his
shoulder
besides
if
the
actual
assault
is
without
danger
the
approach
is
attended
with
a
difficulty
that
increases
the
merit
of
these
poachers
the
coveted
game
is
invisible
it
is
confined
in
the
stronghold
of
a
cell
and
moreover
protected
by
the
surrounding
wall
of
a

to
determine
the

spot
at
which
it

to
lay

on

at

number

of
parasites
for
the
tachina
the
melecta
the
crocisa
the
in
short
for
all
those
who
feed
on
the
provisions
of
others
all
things
considered
is
ignoble
the
right
epithet
to
apply
to
parasitism
no
doubt
in
the
human
race
the
idler
who
feeds
at
other
people
tables
is
contemptible
at
all
points
but
must
the
animal
bear
the
burden
of
the
indignation
inspired
by
our
own
vices
our
parasites
our
scurvy
parasites
live
at
their
neighbour
expense
the
animal
never
and
this
changes
the
whole
aspect
of
the
question
i
know
of
no
instance
not
one
excepting
man
of
parasites
who
consume
the
provisions
hoarded
by
a
worker
of
the
same
species
there
may
be
here
and
there
a
few
cases
of
larceny
of
casual
pillage
among
hoarders
belonging
to
the
same
trade
that
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
but
it
does
not
affect
things
what
would
be
really
serious
and
what
i
formally
deny
is
that
in
the
same
zoological
species
there
should
be
some
who
possessed
the
attribute
of
living
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
in
vain
do
i
consult
my
memory
and
my
notes
my
long
entomological
career
does
not
furnish
me
with
a
solitary
example
of
such
a
misdeed
as
that
of
an
insect
leading
the
life
of
a
parasite
upon
its
fellows
when
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
works
in
her
thousands
at
her
cyclopean
edifice
each
has
her
own
home
a
sacred
home
where
not
one
of
the
tumultuous
swarm
except
the
proprietress
dreams
of
taking
a
mouthful
of
honey
it
is
as
though
there
were
a
neighbourly
understanding
to
respect
the
others
rights
moreover
if
some
heedless
one
mistakes
her
cell
and
so
much
as
alights
on
the
rim
of
a
cup
that
does
not
belong
to
her
forthwith
the
owner
appears
admonishes
her
severely
and
soon
calls
her
to
order
but
if
the
store
of
honey
is
the
estate
of
some
deceased
bee
or
of
some
wanderer
unduly
prolonging
her
absence
then
and
then
alone
a
kinswoman
seizes
upon
it
the
goods
were
waste
property
which
she
turns
to
account
and
it
is
a
very
proper
economy
the
other
bees
and
wasps
behave
likewise
never
i
say
never
do
we
find
among
them
an
idler
assiduously
planning
the
conquest
of
her
neighbour
possessions
no
insect
is
a
parasite
on
its
own
species
what
then
is
parasitism
if
one
must
look
for
it
among
animals
of
different
races
life
in
general
is
but
a
vast
brigandage
nature
devours
herself
matter
is
kept
alive
by
passing
from
one
stomach
into
another
at
the
banquet
of
life
each
is
in
turn
the
guest
and
the
dish
the
eater
of
becomes
the
eaten
of
tomorrow
hodie
tibi
cras
mihi
everything
lives
on
that
which
lives
or
has
lived
everything
is
parasitism
man
is
the
great
parasite
the
unbridled
thief
of
all
that
is
fit
to
eat
he
steals
the
milk
from
the
lamb
he
steals
the
honey
from
the
children
of
the
bee
even
as
the
melecta
pilfers
the
pottage
of
the
anthophora
sons
the
two
cases
are
similar
is
it
the
vice
of
indolence
no
it
is
the
fierce
law
which
for
the
life
of
the
one
exacts
the
death
of
the
other
in
this
implacable
struggle
of
devourers
and
devoured
of
pillagers
and
pillaged
of
robbers
and
robbed
the
melecta
deserves
no
more
than
we
the
title
of
ignoble
in
ruining
the
anthophora
she
is
but
imitating
man
in
one
detail
man
who
is
the
infinite
source
of
destruction
her
parasitism
is
no
blacker
than
ours
she
has
to
feed
her
offspring
and
possessing
no
ignorant
besides
of
the
art
of
harvesting
she
uses
the
provisions
of
others
who
are
better
endowed
with
implements
and
talents
in
the
fierce
riot
of
empty
bellies
she
does
what
she
can
with
the
gifts
at
her
disposal
chapter
the
theory
of
parasitism
the
melecta
does
what
she
can
with
the
gifts
at
her
disposal
i
should
leave
it
at
that
if
i
had
not
to
take
into
consideration
a
grave
charge
brought
against
her
she
is
accused
of
having
lost
for
want
of
use
and
through
laziness
the
workman
tools
with
which
so
we
are
told
she
was
originally
endowed
finding
it
to
her
advantage
to
do
nothing
bringing
up
her
family
free
of
expense
to
the
detriment
of
others
she
is
alleged
to
have
gradually
inspired
her
race
with
an
abhorrence
for
work
the
less
and
less
often
employed
dwindled
and
perished
as
organs
having
no
function
the
species
changed
into
a
different
one
and
finally
idleness
turned
the
honest
worker
of
the
outset
into
a
parasite
this
brings
us
to
a
very
simple
and
seductive
theory
of
parasitism
worthy
to
be
discussed
with
all
respect
let
us
set
it
forth
some
mother
nearing
the
end
of
her
labours
and
in
a
hurry
to
lay
her
eggs
found
let
us
suppose
some
convenient
cells
provisioned
by
her
fellows
there
was
no
time
for
and
foraging
if
she
would
save
her
family
she
must
perforce
appropriate
the
fruit
of
toil
thus
relieved
of
the
tedium
and
fatigue
of
work
freed
of
every
care
but
that
of
laying
eggs
she
left
a
progeny
which
duly
inherited
the
maternal
slothfulness
and
handed
this
down
in
its
turn
in
a
more
and
more
accentuated
form
as
generation
followed
on
generation
for
the
struggle
for
life
made
this
expeditious
way
of
establishing
yourself
one
of
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
the
success
of
the
offspring
at
the
same
time
the
organs
of
work
left
unemployed
became
atrophied
and
disappeared
while
certain
details
of
shape
and
colouring
were
modified
more
or
less
so
as
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
new
circumstances
thus
the
parasitic
race
was
definitely
established
this
race
however
was
not
too
greatly
transformed
for
us
to
be
able
in
certain
cases
to
trace
its
origin
the
parasite
has
retained
more
than
one
feature
of
those
industrious
ancestors
so
for
instance
the
psithyrus
is
extremely
like
the
whose
parasite
and
descendant
she
is
the
stelis
preserves
the
ancestral
characteristics
of
the
anthidium
the
recalls
the
thus
speak
the
evolutionists
with
a
wealth
of
evidence
derived
not
only
from
correspondence
in
general
appearance
but
also
from
similarity
in
the
most
minute
particulars
nothing
is
small
i
am
as
much
convinced
of
that
as
any
man
and
i
admire
the
extraordinary
precision
of
the
details
furnished
as
a
basis
for
the
theory
but
am
i
convinced
rightly
or
wrongly
my
turn
of
mind
does
not
hold
minutiae
of
structure
in
great
favour
a
joint
of
the
palpi
leaves
me
rather
cold
a
tuft
of
bristles
does
not
appear
to
me
an
unanswerable
argument
i
prefer
to
question
the
creature
direct
and
to
let
it
describe
its
passions
its
mode
of
life
its
aptitudes
having
heard
its
evidence
we
shall
see
what
becomes
of
the
theory
of
parasitism
before
calling
upon
it
to
speak
why
should
i
not
say
what
i
have
on
my
mind
and
mark
me
first
of
all
i
do
not
like
that
laziness
which
is
said
to
favour
the
animal
prosperity
i
have
also
believed
and
i
still
persist
in
believing
that
activity
alone
strengthens
the
present
and
ensures
the
future
both
of
animals
and
men
to
act
is
to
live
to
work
is
to
go
forward
the
energy
of
a
race
is
measured
by
the
aggregate
of
its
action
no
i
do
not
like
it
at
all
this
idleness
so
much
commended
of
science
we
have
quite
enough
of
these
zoological
brutalities
man
the
son
of
the
ape
duty
a
foolish
prejudice
conscience
a
lure
for
the
simple
genius
neurosis
patriotism
jingo
heroics
the
soul
a
product
of
protoplasmic
energies
god
a
puerile
myth
let
us
raise
the
and
go
out
for
scalps
we
are
here
only
to
devour
one
another
the
summum
bonum
is
the
chicago
packer
enough
quite
enough
of
that
without
having
transformism
next
to
break
down
the
sacred
law
of
work
i
will
not
hold
it
responsible
for
our
moral
ruin
it
has
not
a
sturdy
enough
shoulder
to
effect
such
a
breach
but
still
it
has
done
its
worst
no
once
more
i
do
not
like
those
brutalities
which
denying
all
that
gives
some
dignity
to
our
wretched
life
stifle
our
horizon
under
an
extinguisher
of
matter
oh
do
come
and
forbid
me
to
think
though
it
were
but
a
dream
of
a
responsible
human
personality
of
conscience
of
duty
of
the
dignity
of
labour
everything
is
linked
together
if
the
animal
is
better
off
as
regards
both
itself
and
its
race
for
doing
nothing
and
exploiting
others
why
should
man
its
descendant
show
greater
scruples
the
principle
that
idleness
is
the
mother
of
prosperity
would
carry
us
far
indeed
i
have
said
enough
on
my
own
account
i
will
call
upon
the
animals
themselves
more
eloquent
than
i
are
we
so
very
sure
that
parasitic
habits
come
from
a
love
of
inaction
did
the
parasite
become
what
he
is
because
he
found
it
excellent
to
do
nothing
is
repose
so
great
an
advantage
to
him
that
he
abjured
his
ancient
customs
in
order
to
obtain
it
well
since
i
have
been
studying
the
bee
who
endows
her
family
with
the
property
of
others
i
have
not
yet
seen
anything
in
her
that
points
to
slothfulness
on
the
contrary
the
parasite
leads
a
laborious
life
harder
than
that
of
the
worker
watch
her
on
a
slope
blistered
by
the
sun
how
busy
she
is
how
anxious
how
briskly
she
covers
every
inch
of
the
radiant
expanse
how
indefatigable
she
is
in
her
endless
quests
in
her
visits
which
are
generally
fruitless
before
coming
upon
a
nest
that
suits
her
she
has
dived
a
hundred
times
into
cavities
of
no
value
into
galleries
not
yet
victualled
and
then
however
kindly
her
host
the
parasite
is
not
always
well
received
in
the
hostelry
no
it
is
not
all
roses
in
her
trade
the
expenditure
of
time
and
labour
which
she
finds
necessary
in
order
to
house
an
egg
may
easily
equal
or
even
exceed
that
of
the
worker
in
building
her
cell
and
filling
it
with
honey
that
industrious
one
has
regular
and
continuous
work
an
excellent
condition
for
success
in
her
the
other
has
a
thankless
and
precarious
task
at
the
mercy
of
a
thousand
accidents
which
endanger
the
great
undertaking
of
installing
the
eggs
one
has
only
to
watch
the
prolonged
hesitation
of
a
coelioxys
seeking
for
the
cells
to
recognize
that
the
usurpation
of
another
nest
is
not
effected
without
serious
difficulties
if
she
turned
parasite
in
order
to
make
the
rearing
of
her
offspring
easier
and
more
prosperous
certainly
she
was
very
instead
of
rest
hard
work
instead
of
a
flourishing
family
a
meagre
progeny
to
generalities
which
are
necessarily
vague
we
will
add
some
precise
facts
a
certain
stelis
stelis
nasuta
latr
is
a
parasite
of
the
of
the
walls
when
the
chalicodoma
has
finished
building
her
dome
of
cells
upon
her
pebble
the
parasite
appears
makes
a
long
inspection
of
the
outside
of
the
home
and
proposes
puny
as
she
is
to
introduce
her
eggs
into
this
cement
fortress
everything
is
most
carefully
closed
a
layer
of
rough
plaster
at
least
of
an
inch
thick
entirely
covers
the
central
accumulation
of
cells
which
are
each
of
them
sealed
with
a
thick
mortar
plug
and
it
is
the
honey
of
these
chambers
that
has
to
be
reached
by
piercing
a
wall
almost
as
hard
as
rock
the
parasite
pluckily
sets
to
the
idler
becomes
a
glutton
for
work
atom
by
atom
she
perforates
the
general
enclosure
and
scoops
out
a
shaft
just
sufficient
for
her
passage
she
reaches
the
lid
of
the
cell
and
gnaws
it
until
the
coveted
provisions
appear
in
sight
it
is
a
slow
and
painful
process
in
which
the
feeble
stelis
wears
herself
out
for
the
mortar
is
much
the
same
as
roman
cement
in
hardness
i
myself
find
a
difficulty
in
breaking
it
with
the
point
of
my
knife
what
patient
effort
then
the
task
requires
from
the
parasite
with
her
tiny
pincers
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
long
the
stelis
takes
to
make
her
as
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
or
rather
the
patience
to
follow
the
work
from
start
to
finish
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
a
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
incomparably
larger
and
stronger
than
the
parasite
when
demolishing
before
my
eyes
the
lid
of
a
cell
sealed
only
the
day
before
was
unable
to
complete
her
undertaking
in
one
afternoon
i
had
to
come
to
her
assistance
in
order
to
discover
before
the
end
of
the
day
the
object
of
her
housebreaking
when
the
mortar
has
once
set
its
resistance
is
that
of
stone
now
the
stelis
has
not
only
to
pierce
the
lid
of
the
she
must
also
pierce
the
general
casing
of
the
nest
what
a
time
it
must
take
her
to
get
through
such
a
task
a
gigantic
one
for
her
poor
tools
it
is
done
at
last
after
infinite
labour
the
honey
appears
the
stelis
slips
through
and
on
the
surface
of
the
provisions
side
by
side
with
the
chalicodoma
eggs
the
number
varying
from
time
to
time
the
victuals
will
be
the
common
property
of
all
the
new
arrivals
whether
the
son
of
the
house
or
strangers
the
violated
dwelling
can
not
remain
as
it
is
exposed
to
marauders
from
without
the
parasite
must
herself
wall
up
the
breach
which
she
has
contrived
the
quondam
housebreaker
becomes
a
builder
at
the
foot
of
the
pebble
the
stelis
collects
a
little
of
that
red
earth
which
characterizes
our
stony
plateaus
grown
with
lavender
and
thyme
she
makes
it
into
mortar
by
wetting
it
with
saliva
and
with
the
pellets
thus
prepared
she
fills
up
the
displaying
all
the
care
and
art
of
a
regular
only
the
work
clashes
in
colour
with
the
chalicodoma
the
bee
goes
and
gathers
her
on
the
adjoining
the
metal
of
which
consists
of
broken
and
very
seldom
uses
the
red
earth
under
the
pebble
supporting
the
nest
this
choice
is
apparently
dictated
by
the
fact
that
the
chemical
properties
of
the
former
are
more
likely
to
produce
a
solid
structure
the
lime
of
the
road
mixed
with
saliva
yields
a
harder
cement
than
red
clay
would
do
at
any
rate
the
chalicodoma
nest
is
more
or
less
white
because
of
the
source
of
its
materials
when
a
red
speck
a
few
millimetres
wide
appears
on
this
pale
background
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
a
stelis
has
been
that
way
open
the
cell
that
lies
under
the
red
stain
we
shall
find
the
parasite
numerous
family
established
there
the
rusty
spot
is
an
infallible
indication
that
the
dwelling
has
been
violated
at
least
it
is
so
in
my
neighbourhood
where
the
soil
is
as
i
have
described
we
see
the
stelis
therefore
at
first
a
rabid
miner
using
her
mandibles
against
the
rock
next
a
kneader
of
clay
and
a
plasterer
restoring
broken
ceilings
her
trade
does
not
seem
one
of
the
least
arduous
now
what
did
she
do
before
she
took
to
parasitism
judging
from
her
appearance
the
transformists
tell
us
that
she
was
an
anthidium
that
is
to
say
she
used
to
gather
the
soft
from
the
dry
stalks
of
the
lanate
plants
and
fashion
it
into
wallets
in
which
to
heap
up
the
which
she
gleaned
from
the
flowers
by
means
of
a
brush
carried
on
her
abdomen
or
else
springing
from
a
genus
akin
to
the
she
used
to
build
resin
partitions
in
the
spiral
stairway
of
a
dead
snail
such
was
the
trade
driven
by
her
ancestors
really
so
to
avoid
slow
and
painful
work
to
achieve
an
easy
life
to
give
herself
the
leisure
favourable
to
the
settlement
of
her
family
the
erstwhile
or
collector
of
took
to
gnawing
hardened
cement
she
who
once
sipped
the
nectar
of
flowers
made
up
her
mind
to
chew
concrete
why
the
poor
wretch
toils
at
her
filing
like
a
she
spends
more
time
in
ripping
up
a
cell
than
it
would
take
her
to
make
a
cotton
wallet
and
fill
it
with
food
if
she
really
meant
to
progress
to
do
better
in
her
own
interest
and
that
of
her
family
by
abandoning
the
delicate
occupations
of
the
old
days
we
must
confess
that
she
has
made
a
strange
mistake
the
mistake
would
be
no
greater
if
fingers
accustomed
to
were
to
lay
aside
velvet
and
silk
and
proceed
to
handle
the
quarryman
blocks
or
to
break
stones
on
the
roadside
no
the
animal
does
not
commit
the
folly
of
voluntarily
embittering
its
lot
it
does
not
in
obedience
to
the
promptings
of
idleness
give
up
one
condition
to
embrace
another
and
a
more
irksome
should
it
blunder
for
once
it
will
not
inspire
its
posterity
with
a
wish
to
persevere
in
a
costly
delusion
no
the
stelis
never
abandoned
the
delicate
art
of
to
break
down
walls
and
to
grind
cement
a
class
of
work
far
too
unattractive
to
efface
the
memory
of
the
joys
of
harvesting
amid
the
flowers
indolence
has
not
evolved
her
from
an
anthidium
she
has
always
been
what
she
is
a
patient
artificer
in
her
own
line
a
steady
worker
at
the
task
that
has
fallen
to
her
share
that
hurried
mother
who
first
in
remote
ages
broke
into
the
abode
of
her
fellows
to
secure
a
home
for
her
eggs
found
this
unscrupulous
method
so
you
tell
us
very
favourable
to
the
success
of
her
race
by
virtue
of
its
economy
of
time
and
trouble
the
impression
left
by
this
new
policy
was
so
profound
that
heredity
bequeathed
it
to
posterity
in
proportions
until
at
last
parasitic
habits
became
definitely
fixed
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
followed
by
the
osmia
will
teach
us
what
to
think
of
this
conjecture
i
have
described
in
an
earlier
chapter
my
installation
of
against
the
walls
of
a
porch
facing
the
south
here
on
a
level
with
my
head
placed
so
that
they
can
easily
be
observed
hang
some
tiles
removed
from
the
neighbouring
roofs
in
winter
together
with
their
enormous
nests
and
their
occupants
every
may
for
five
or
six
years
in
succession
i
have
assiduously
watched
the
works
of
my
from
the
mass
of
my
notes
on
the
subject
i
take
the
following
experiments
which
bear
upon
the
matter
under
discussion
long
ago
when
i
used
to
scatter
a
handful
of
chalicodomae
some
way
from
home
in
order
to
study
their
capacity
for
finding
their
nest
again
i
noticed
that
if
they
were
too
long
absent
the
laggards
found
their
cells
closed
on
their
return
neighbours
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
lay
their
eggs
there
after
finishing
the
building
and
stocking
it
with
provisions
the
abandoned
property
benefited
another
on
realizing
the
usurpation
the
bee
returning
from
her
long
journey
soon
consoled
herself
for
the
mishap
she
began
to
break
the
seals
of
some
cell
or
other
adjoining
her
own
the
rest
let
her
have
her
way
being
doubtless
too
busy
with
their
present
labours
to
seek
a
quarrel
with
the
freebooter
as
soon
as
she
had
destroyed
the
lid
the
bee
with
a
sort
of
feverish
haste
that
burned
to
repay
theft
by
theft
did
a
little
building
did
a
little
victualling
as
though
to
resume
the
thread
of
her
occupations
destroyed
the
egg
in
being
laid
her
own
and
closed
the
cell
again
here
was
a
touch
of
nature
that
deserved
careful
examination
at
eleven
in
the
morning
when
the
work
is
at
its
height
i
mark
of
chalicodomae
with
different
colours
to
distinguish
them
from
one
another
some
are
occupied
with
building
others
are
disgorging
honey
i
mark
the
corresponding
cells
in
the
same
way
as
soon
as
the
marks
are
quite
dry
i
catch
the
ten
bees
place
them
singly
in
screws
of
paper
and
shut
them
all
in
a
box
until
the
next
morning
after
hours
captivity
the
prisoners
are
released
during
their
absence
their
cells
have
disappeared
under
a
layer
of
recent
structures
or
if
still
exposed
to
view
they
are
closed
and
others
have
made
use
of
them
as
soon
as
they
are
free
the
ten
bees
with
one
exception
return
to
their
respective
tiles
they
do
more
than
this
so
accurate
is
their
memory
despite
the
confusion
resulting
from
a
prolonged
incarceration
they
return
to
the
cell
which
they
have
built
the
beloved
stolen
cell
they
minutely
explore
the
outside
of
it
or
at
least
what
lies
nearest
to
it
if
the
cell
has
disappeared
under
the
new
structures
in
cases
where
the
home
is
not
henceforward
inaccessible
it
is
at
least
occupied
by
a
strange
egg
and
the
door
is
securely
fastened
to
this
reverse
of
fortune
the
ousted
ones
retort
with
the
brutal
lex
talionis
an
egg
for
an
egg
a
cell
for
a
cell
you
stolen
my
house
i
steal
yours
and
without
much
hesitation
they
proceed
to
force
the
lid
of
a
cell
that
suits
them
sometimes
they
recover
possession
of
their
own
home
if
it
is
possible
to
get
into
it
sometimes
and
more
frequently
they
seize
upon
some
one
else
even
at
a
considerable
distance
from
their
original
dwelling
patiently
they
gnaw
the
mortar
lid
as
the
general
covering
all
the
cells
is
not
applied
until
the
end
of
the
work
all
that
they
need
do
is
to
demolish
the
lid
a
hard
and
wearisome
task
but
not
beyond
the
strength
of
their
mandibles
they
therefore
attack
the
door
the
cement
disk
and
reduce
it
to
dust
the
criminal
is
allowed
to
carry
out
her
nefarious
designs
without
the
slightest
interference
or
protest
from
any
of
her
neighbours
though
these
must
necessarily
include
the
chief
party
interested
the
bee
is
as
forgetful
of
her
cell
of
yesterday
as
she
is
jealous
of
her
actual
cell
to
her
the
present
is
everything
the
past
means
nothing
and
the
future
means
no
more
and
so
the
population
of
the
tile
leave
the
breakers
of
doors
to
do
their
business
in
peace
none
hastens
to
the
defence
of
a
home
that
might
well
be
her
own
how
differently
things
would
happen
if
the
cell
were
still
on
the
stocks
but
it
dates
back
to
yesterday
to
the
day
before
and
no
one
gives
it
another
thought
it
done
the
lid
is
demolished
access
is
free
for
some
time
the
bee
stands
bending
over
the
cell
her
head
in
it
as
though
in
contemplation
she
goes
away
she
returns
undecidedly
at
last
she
makes
up
her
mind
the
egg
is
snapped
up
from
the
surface
of
the
honey
and
flung
on
the
with
no
more
ceremony
than
if
the
bee
were
ridding
the
house
of
a
bit
of
dirt
i
have
witnessed
this
hideous
crime
again
and
yet
again
i
confess
to
having
repeatedly
provoked
it
in
housing
her
egg
the
displays
a
brutal
indifference
to
the
fate
of
her
neighbour
egg
i
see
some
of
them
afterwards
busy
provisioning
disgorging
honey
and
brushing
pollen
into
the
cell
already
completely
provisioned
i
see
some
masoning
a
little
at
the
orifice
or
at
least
laying
on
a
few
trowels
of
mortar
it
seems
as
if
the
bee
although
the
victuals
and
the
building
are
just
as
they
should
be
were
resuming
the
work
at
the
point
at
which
she
left
it
hours
before
lastly
the
egg
is
laid
and
the
opening
closed
up
of
my
captives
one
less
patient
than
the
rest
rejects
the
slow
process
of
eating
away
the
cover
and
decides
in
favour
of
robbery
with
violence
on
the
principle
that
might
is
right
she
dislodges
the
owner
of
a
cell
keeps
good
watch
for
a
long
time
on
the
threshold
of
the
home
and
when
she
feels
herself
the
mistress
of
the
house
goes
on
with
the
provisioning
i
follow
the
ousted
proprietress
with
my
eyes
i
see
her
seize
upon
a
closed
cell
by
breaking
into
it
behaving
in
all
respects
like
my
imprisoned
chalicodomae
the
whole
occurrence
was
too
significant
to
be
left
without
further
confirmation
i
repeated
the
experiment
therefore
almost
every
year
always
with
the
same
success
i
can
only
add
that
among
the
bees
placed
by
my
artifices
under
the
necessity
of
making
up
for
lost
time
a
few
are
of
a
more
temperament
i
see
some
building
anew
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
way
had
happened
others
this
is
a
very
rare
course
going
to
settle
on
another
tile
as
though
to
avoid
a
society
of
thieves
and
lastly
a
few
who
bring
pellets
of
mortar
and
zealously
finish
the
lid
of
their
own
cell
although
it
contains
a
strange
egg
however
housebreaking
is
the
usual
thing
one
more
detail
not
without
value
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
intervene
and
imprison
for
a
time
in
order
to
witness
the
acts
of
violence
which
i
have
described
if
you
follow
the
work
of
the
swarm
assiduously
you
may
occasionally
find
a
surprise
awaiting
you
a
will
appear
and
for
no
reason
known
to
you
break
open
a
door
and
lay
her
egg
in
the
violated
cell
from
what
goes
before
i
look
upon
the
bee
as
a
laggard
kept
away
from
the
workyard
by
an
accident
or
else
carried
to
a
distance
by
a
gust
of
wind
on
returning
after
an
absence
of
some
duration
she
finds
her
place
taken
her
cell
used
by
another
the
victim
of
an
usurper
villainy
like
the
prisoners
in
my
paper
screws
she
behaves
as
they
do
and
indemnifies
herself
for
her
loss
by
breaking
into
another
home
lastly
it
was
a
matter
of
learning
the
behaviour
after
their
act
of
violence
of
the
masons
who
have
smashed
in
a
door
brutally
expelled
the
egg
within
and
replaced
it
by
one
of
their
own
laying
when
the
lid
is
repaired
to
look
as
good
as
new
and
everything
restored
to
order
will
they
continue
their
burglarious
ways
and
exterminate
the
eggs
of
others
to
make
room
for
their
own
by
no
means
revenge
that
pleasure
of
the
gods
and
perhaps
also
of
bees
is
satisfied
after
one
cell
has
been
ripped
open
all
anger
is
appeased
when
the
egg
for
which
so
much
work
has
been
done
is
safely
housed
henceforth
both
prisoners
and
stray
laggards
resume
their
ordinary
labours
indifferently
with
the
rest
they
build
honestly
they
provision
honestly
nor
meditate
further
evil
the
past
is
quite
forgotten
until
a
fresh
disaster
occurs
to
return
to
the
parasites
a
mother
chanced
to
find
herself
the
mistress
of
another
nest
she
took
advantage
of
this
to
entrust
her
egg
to
it
this
expeditious
method
so
easy
for
the
mother
and
so
favourable
to
the
success
of
her
offspring
made
such
an
impression
on
her
that
she
transmitted
the
maternal
indolence
to
her
posterity
thus
the
worker
gradually
became
transformed
into
a
parasite
capital
the
thing
goes
like
clockwork
as
long
as
we
have
only
to
put
our
ideas
on
paper
but
let
us
just
consult
the
facts
if
you
mind
before
arguing
about
probabilities
let
us
look
into
things
as
they
are
here
is
the
of
the
sheds
teaching
us
something
very
curious
to
smash
the
lid
of
a
cell
that
does
not
belong
to
her
to
throw
the
egg
out
of
doors
and
put
her
own
in
its
place
is
a
practice
which
she
has
followed
since
time
began
there
is
no
need
of
my
interference
to
make
her
commit
burglary
she
commits
it
of
her
own
accord
when
her
rights
are
prejudiced
as
the
result
of
a
absence
ever
since
her
race
has
been
kneading
cement
she
has
known
the
law
of
retaliation
countless
ages
such
as
the
evolutionists
require
have
made
her
adopt
forcible
usurpation
as
an
inveterate
habit
moreover
robbery
is
so
incomparably
easy
for
the
mother
no
more
cement
to
scratch
up
with
her
mandibles
on
the
hard
ground
no
more
mortar
to
knead
no
more
clay
walls
to
build
no
more
pollen
to
gather
on
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
journeys
all
is
ready
board
and
lodging
never
was
a
better
opportunity
for
allowing
one
self
a
good
time
there
is
nothing
against
it
the
others
the
workers
are
imperturbable
in
their
their
outraged
cells
leave
them
profoundly
indifferent
there
are
no
brawls
to
fear
no
protests
now
or
never
is
the
moment
to
tread
the
primrose
path
besides
your
progeny
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
you
can
choose
the
warmest
and
wholesomest
spots
you
can
multiply
your
by
devoting
to
them
all
the
time
that
you
would
have
to
spend
on
irksome
occupations
if
the
impression
produced
by
the
violent
seizure
of
another
property
is
strong
enough
to
be
handed
down
by
heredity
how
deep
should
be
the
impression
of
the
actual
moment
when
the
is
in
the
first
flush
of
success
the
precious
advantage
is
fresh
in
the
memory
dating
from
that
very
instant
the
mother
has
but
to
continue
in
order
to
create
a
method
of
installation
favourable
in
the
highest
degree
to
her
and
hers
come
poor
bee
throw
aside
your
exhausting
labours
follow
the
evolutionists
advice
and
as
you
have
the
means
at
your
disposal
become
a
parasite
but
no
having
effected
her
little
revenge
the
builder
returns
to
her
masonry
the
gleaner
to
her
gleaning
with
unquenchable
zeal
she
forgets
the
crime
committed
in
a
moment
of
anger
and
takes
good
care
not
to
hand
down
any
tendency
towards
idleness
to
her
offspring
she
knows
too
well
that
activity
is
life
that
work
is
the
world
great
joy
what
myriads
of
cells
has
she
not
broken
open
since
she
has
been
building
what
magnificent
opportunities
all
so
clear
and
conclusive
has
she
not
had
to
emancipate
herself
from
drudgery
nothing
could
convince
her
born
to
work
she
persists
in
an
industrious
life
she
might
at
least
have
produced
an
offshoot
a
race
of
housebreakers
who
would
invade
cells
by
demolishing
doors
the
stelis
does
something
of
the
kind
but
who
would
think
of
proclaiming
a
relationship
between
the
chalicodoma
and
her
the
two
have
nothing
in
common
i
call
for
a
scion
of
the
of
the
sheds
who
shall
live
by
the
art
of
breaking
through
ceilings
until
they
show
me
one
the
theorists
will
only
make
me
smile
when
they
talk
to
me
of
erstwhile
workers
relinquishing
their
trade
to
become
parasitic
sluggards
i
also
call
with
no
less
insistence
for
a
descendant
of
the
osmia
a
descendant
given
to
demolishing
i
will
describe
later
how
i
managed
to
make
a
whole
swarm
of
these
osmiae
build
their
nests
on
the
table
in
my
study
in
glass
tubes
that
enabled
me
to
see
the
inmost
secrets
of
the
work
of
the
bee
cf
and
others
by
henri
fabre
translated
by
alexander
teixeira
de
mattos
chapters
to
translator
note
for
three
or
four
weeks
each
osmia
is
scrupulously
faithful
to
her
tube
which
is
laboriously
filled
with
a
set
of
chambers
divided
by
earthen
partitions
marks
of
different
colours
painted
on
the
thorax
of
the
workers
enable
me
to
recognize
individuals
in
the
crowd
each
crystal
gallery
is
the
exclusive
property
of
one
osmia
no
other
enters
it
builds
in
it
or
hoards
in
it
if
through
heedlessness
through
momentary
forgetfulness
of
her
own
house
in
the
tumult
of
the
city
some
neighbour
so
much
as
comes
and
looks
in
at
the
door
the
owner
soon
puts
her
to
flight
no
such
indiscretion
is
tolerated
every
bee
has
her
home
and
every
home
its
bee
all
goes
well
until
just
before
the
end
of
the
work
the
tubes
are
then
closed
at
the
orifice
with
a
thick
plug
of
earth
nearly
the
whole
swarm
has
disappeared
there
remain
on
the
spot
a
score
of
tatterdemalions
in
threadbare
fleeces
worn
out
by
a
month
hard
toil
these
laggards
have
not
finished
their
laying
there
is
no
lack
of
unoccupied
tubes
for
i
take
care
to
remove
some
of
those
which
are
full
and
to
replace
them
by
others
that
have
not
yet
been
used
very
few
of
the
bees
decide
to
take
possession
of
these
new
homes
which
differ
in
no
particular
from
the
earlier
ones
and
even
then
they
build
only
a
small
number
of
cells
which
are
often
mere
attempts
at
partitions
they
want
something
different
a
nest
belonging
to
some
one
else
they
bore
through
the
stopper
of
the
inhabited
tubes
a
work
of
no
great
difficulty
for
we
have
here
not
the
hard
cement
of
the
chalicodoma
but
a
simple
lid
of
dried
mud
when
the
entrance
is
cleared
a
cell
appears
with
its
store
of
provisions
and
its
egg
with
her
brutal
mandibles
she
rips
it
open
and
goes
and
flings
it
away
she
does
worse
she
eats
it
on
the
spot
i
had
to
witness
this
horror
many
times
over
before
i
could
accept
it
as
a
fact
note
that
the
egg
devoured
may
very
well
contain
the
criminal
own
offspring
imperiously
swayed
by
the
needs
of
her
present
family
the
osmia
puts
her
past
family
entirely
out
of
her
mind
having
perpetrated
this
the
depraved
creature
does
a
little
provisioning
they
all
experience
the
same
necessity
to
go
backwards
in
the
sequence
of
actions
in
order
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
their
interrupted
occupations
her
next
work
is
to
lay
her
egg
and
then
she
conscientiously
restores
the
demolished
lid
the
havoc
can
be
more
sweeping
still
one
of
these
laggards
is
not
satisfied
with
a
single
cell
she
needs
two
three
four
to
reach
the
most
remote
the
osmia
wrecks
all
those
which
come
before
it
the
partitions
are
broken
down
the
eggs
eaten
or
thrown
away
the
provisions
swept
outside
and
often
even
carried
to
a
distance
in
great
lumps
covered
with
dust
from
the
loose
plaster
of
the
demolition
floured
all
over
with
the
rifled
pollen
sticky
with
the
contents
of
the
mangled
eggs
the
osmia
while
at
her
brigand
work
is
altered
beyond
recognition
once
the
place
is
cleared
everything
resumes
its
normal
course
provisions
are
laboriously
brought
to
take
the
place
of
those
which
have
been
thrown
away
eggs
are
laid
one
on
each
heap
of
food
the
partitions
are
built
up
again
and
the
massive
plug
sealing
the
whole
structure
is
made
as
good
as
new
crimes
of
this
kind
recur
so
often
that
i
am
obliged
to
interfere
and
place
in
safety
the
nests
which
i
wish
to
keep
intact
and
nothing
as
yet
explains
this
brigandage
bursting
forth
at
the
end
of
the
work
like
a
moral
epidemic
like
a
frenzied
delirium
i
should
say
nothing
if
the
site
were
lacking
but
the
tubes
are
there
close
by
empty
and
quite
fit
to
receive
the
eggs
the
osmia
refuses
them
she
prefers
to
plunder
is
it
from
weariness
from
a
distaste
for
work
after
a
period
of
fierce
activity
not
at
all
for
when
a
row
of
cells
has
been
stripped
of
its
contents
after
the
ravage
and
waste
she
has
to
come
back
to
ordinary
work
with
all
its
burdens
the
labour
is
not
reduced
it
is
increased
it
would
pay
the
bee
infinitely
better
if
she
wants
to
continue
her
laying
to
make
her
home
in
an
unoccupied
tube
the
osmia
thinks
differently
her
reasons
for
acting
as
she
does
escape
me
can
there
be
characters
among
her
characters
that
delight
in
a
neighbour
ruin
there
are
among
men
in
the
privacy
of
her
native
haunts
the
osmia
i
have
no
doubt
behaves
as
in
my
crystal
galleries
towards
the
end
of
the
she
violates
others
dwellings
by
keeping
to
the
first
cell
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
empty
in
order
to
reach
the
next
she
can
utilize
the
provisions
on
the
spot
and
shorten
to
that
extent
the
longest
part
of
her
work
as
usurpations
of
this
kind
have
had
ample
time
to
become
inveterate
to
become
inbred
in
the
race
i
ask
for
a
descendant
of
the
osmia
who
eats
her
grandmother
egg
in
order
to
establish
her
own
egg
this
descendant
i
shall
not
be
shown
but
i
may
be
told
that
she
is
in
process
of
formation
the
outrages
which
i
have
described
are
preparing
a
future
parasite
the
transformists
dogmatize
about
the
past
and
dogmatize
about
the
future
but
as
seldom
as
possible
talk
to
us
about
the
present
transformations
have
taken
place
transformations
will
take
place
the
pity
of
it
is
that
they
are
not
actually
taking
place
of
the
three
tenses
one
is
lacking
the
very
one
which
directly
interests
us
and
which
alone
is
clear
of
the
incubus
of
theory
this
silence
about
the
present
does
not
please
me
overmuch
scarcely
more
than
the
famous
picture
of
the
crossing
of
the
red
sea
painted
for
a
village
chapel
the
artist
had
put
upon
the
canvas
a
broad
ribbon
of
brightest
scarlet
and
that
was
all
that
the
red
sea
said
the
priest
examining
the
masterpiece
before
paying
for
it
the
red
sea
right
enough
but
where
are
the
israelites
have
passed
replied
the
painter
the
egyptians
are
on
the
way
transformations
have
passed
transformations
are
on
the
way
for
sake
can
not
they
show
us
transformations
in
the
act
must
the
facts
of
the
past
and
the
facts
of
the
future
necessarily
exclude
the
facts
of
the
present
i
fail
to
understand
i
call
for
a
descendant
of
the
chalicodoma
and
a
descendant
of
the
osmia
who
have
robbed
their
neighbours
with
gusto
when
occasion
offered
since
the
origin
of
their
respective
races
and
who
are
working
industriously
to
create
a
parasite
happy
in
doing
nothing
have
they
succeeded
no
will
they
succeed
yes
people
maintain
for
the
moment
nothing
the
osmiae
and
chalicodomae
of
are
what
they
were
when
the
first
trowel
of
cement
or
mud
was
mixed
then
how
many
ages
does
it
take
to
form
a
parasite
too
many
i
fear
for
us
not
to
be
discouraged
if
the
sayings
of
the
theorists
are
going
on
strike
and
living
by
shifts
was
not
always
enough
to
assure
parasitism
in
certain
cases
the
animal
must
have
had
to
change
its
diet
to
pass
from
live
prey
to
vegetarian
fare
which
would
entirely
subvert
its
most
essential
characteristics
what
should
we
say
to
the
wolf
giving
up
mutton
and
browsing
on
grass
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
idleness
the
boldest
would
shrink
from
such
an
absurd
assumption
and
yet
transformism
leads
us
straight
to
it
here
is
an
example
in
july
i
split
some
in
which
osmia
tridentata
has
built
her
nests
in
the
long
series
of
cells
the
lower
already
hold
the
osmia
cocoons
while
the
upper
contain
the
larva
which
has
nearly
finished
consuming
its
provisions
and
the
topmost
show
the
victuals
untouched
with
the
osmia
egg
upon
them
it
is
a
cylindrical
egg
rounded
at
both
extremities
of
a
transparent
white
and
measuring
four
to
five
millimetres
in
length
translator
note
it
lies
slantwise
one
end
of
it
resting
on
the
food
and
the
other
sticking
up
at
some
distance
above
the
honey
now
by
multiplying
my
visits
to
the
fresh
cells
i
have
on
several
occasions
made
a
very
valuable
discovery
on
the
free
end
of
the
egg
another
egg
is
fixed
an
egg
quite
different
in
shape
white
and
transparent
like
the
first
but
much
smaller
and
narrower
blunt
at
one
end
and
tapering
into
a
rather
sharp
point
at
the
other
it
is
two
millimetres
long
by
half
a
millimetre
wide
translator
note
it
is
undeniably
the
egg
of
a
parasite
a
parasite
which
compels
my
attention
by
its
curious
method
of
installing
its
family
it
opens
before
the
osmia
egg
the
tiny
grub
as
soon
as
it
is
born
begins
to
drain
the
rival
egg
of
which
it
occupied
the
top
part
high
up
above
the
honey
the
extermination
soon
becomes
perceptible
you
can
see
the
osmia
egg
turning
muddy
losing
its
brilliancy
becoming
limp
and
wrinkled
in
hours
it
is
nothing
but
an
empty
sheath
a
crumpled
bit
of
skin
all
competition
is
now
removed
the
parasite
is
the
master
of
the
house
the
young
grub
when
demolishing
the
egg
was
active
enough
it
explored
the
dangerous
thing
which
had
to
be
got
rid
of
quickly
it
raised
its
head
to
select
and
multiply
the
now
lying
at
full
length
on
the
surface
of
the
honey
it
no
longer
shifts
its
position
but
the
undulations
of
the
digestive
canal
betray
its
greedy
absorption
of
the
osmia
store
of
food
the
provisions
are
finished
in
a
fortnight
and
the
cocoon
is
woven
it
is
a
fairly
firm
ovoid
of
a
very
colour
two
characteristics
which
at
once
distinguish
it
from
the
osmia
pale
cylindrical
cocoon
the
hatching
takes
place
in
april
or
may
the
puzzle
is
solved
at
last
the
osmia
parasite
is
a
wasp
called
the
spotted
sapyga
sapyga
punctata
now
where
are
we
to
class
this
wasp
a
true
parasite
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
a
consumer
of
others
provisions
her
general
appearance
and
her
structure
make
it
clear
to
any
eye
more
or
less
familiar
with
entomological
shapes
that
she
belongs
to
a
species
akin
to
that
of
the
scoliae
moreover
the
masters
of
classification
so
scrupulous
in
their
comparison
of
characteristics
agree
in
placing
the
sapygae
immediately
after
the
scoliae
and
a
little
before
the
mutillae
the
scoliae
feed
their
grubs
on
prey
so
do
the
mutillae
the
parasite
therefore
if
it
really
derives
from
a
transformed
ancestor
is
descended
from
a
though
it
is
now
an
eater
of
honey
the
wolf
does
more
than
become
a
sheep
he
turns
himself
into
a
will
never
get
an
out
of
an
acorn
franklin
tells
us
with
that
homely
of
his
in
this
case
the
passion
for
jam
must
have
sprung
from
a
love
of
venison
any
theory
might
well
be
deficient
in
balance
when
it
leads
to
such
vagaries
as
this
i
should
have

it
would
be

to
find
a
better

than
the
tribulations
suffered
by
the
chalicodoma
of

the
mason
who
builds
on
the
pebbles
may
fairly
boast
of
being
an
industrious
workwoman
throughout
the
month
of
may
we
see
her
black
squads
in
the
full
heat
of
the
sun
digging
with
busy
teeth
in
the
of
the
road
hard

great
is
her

that
she
hardly
moves
out

to

still
retain

imparted
by

the

the
work
of
making

is
slow
and
painful
it
is
scraped
up
atom
by

and
by
means
of
saliva
turned
into
mortar
then
and
there
when
it
is
all
well
kneaded
and
there
is
enough
to
make
a
load
the
mason
sets
off
with
an
impetuous
flight
in
a
straight
line
and
makes
for
her
pebble
a
few
hundred
paces
away
the
trowel
of
fresh
mortar
is
soon
spent
either
in
adding
another
storey
to
the
edifice
or
in
cementing
into
the
wall
lumps
of
gravel
that
give
it
greater
solidity
the
journeys
in
search
of
cement
are
renewed
until
the
structure
attains
the
regulation
height
without
a
moment
rest
the
bee
returns
a
hundred
times
to
the
always
to
the
one
spot
recognized
as
excellent
the
victuals
are
now
collected
honey
and
if
there
is
a
pink
carpet
of
sainfoin
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
is
there
that
the
mason
goes
plundering
by
preference
though
it
cost
her
a
four
hundred
yards
journey
every
time
her
crop
swells
with
honeyed
exudations
her
belly
is
floured
with
pollen
back
to
the
cell
which
slowly
fills
and
back
straightway
to
the
and
all
day
long
with
not
a
sign
of
weariness
the
same
activity
is
maintained
as
long
as
the
sun
is
high
enough
when
it
is
late
if
the
house
is
not
yet
closed
the
bee
retires
to
her
cell
to
spend

night
there
head
downwards
tip
of
her
abdomen
outside
a
habit
foreign
to
the
chalicodoma
of

sheds
then
and
then
alone
the
mason
rests
but
it
is
a
rest
that
is
in
a
sense
equivalent
to
work
for
thus
placed
she
blocks
the
entrance
to
the
and
defends
her
treasure
against
twilight
or
night
marauders
being
anxious
to
form
some
estimate
of
the
total
distance
covered
by
the
bee
in
the
construction
and
provisioning
of
a
single
cell
i
counted
the
number
of
steps
from
a
nest
to
the
road
where
the
mortar
was
mixed
and
from
the
same
nest
to
the
where
the
harvest
was
gathered
i
took
such
note
as
my
patience
permitted
of
the
journeys
made
in
both
directions
and
completing
these
data
with
a
comparison
between
the
work
done
and
that
which
remained
to
do
i
arrived
at
nine
and
a
half
miles
as
the
result
of
the
total
travelling
of
course
i
give
this
figure
only
as
a
rough
calculation
greater
precision
would
have
demanded
more
perseverance
than
i
can
boast
such
as
it
is
the
result
which
is
probably
under
the
actual
figure
in
many
cases
is
of
a
kind
that
gives
us
a
vivid
idea
of
the
activity
the
complete
nest
will
comprise
about
fifteen
cells
moreover
the
heap
of
cells
will
be
coated
at
the
end
with
a
layer
of
cement
a
good
thick
this
massive
fortification
which
is
less
finished
than
the
rest
of
the
work
but
more
expensive
in
materials
represents
perhaps
in
itself
one
half
of
the
complete
task
so
that
to
establish
her
dome
chalicodoma
muraria
coming
and
going
across
the
arid
traverses
altogether
a
distance
of
miles
which
is
nearly
half
of
the
greatest
dimension
of
france
from
north
to
south
afterwards
when
worn
out
with
all
this
fatigue
the
bee
retires
to
a
to
languish
in
solitude
and
die
she
is
surely
entitled
to
say
have
laboured
i
have
done
my
duty
yes
certainly
the
mason
has
toiled
with
a
vengeance
to
ensure
the
future
of
her
offspring
she
has
spent
her
own
life
without
reserve
her
long
life
of
five
or
six
weeks
duration
and
now
she
breathes
her
last
contented
because
everything
is
in
order
in
the
beloved
house
copious
rations
of
the
first
quality
a
shelter
against
the
winter
frosts
ramparts
against
incursions
of
the
enemy
everything
is
in
order
at
least
so
she
thinks
but
alas
what
a
mistake
the
poor
mother
is
making
here
the
hateful
fatality
stands
revealed
aspera
fata
which
ruins
the
producer
to
provide
a
living
for
the
drone
here
we
see
the
stupid
and
ferocious
law
that
sacrifices
the
worker
for
the
benefit
what
have
we
done
we
and
the
insects
to
be
ground
with
sovran
indifference
under
the
of
such
wretchedness
oh
what
terrible
what
questions
the
misfortunes
would
bring
to
my
lips
if
i
gave
free
scope
to
my
sombre
thoughts
but
let
us
avoid
these
useless
whys
and
keep
within
the
province
of
the
mere
recorder
there
are
some
ten
of
them
plotting
the
ruin
of
the
peaceable
and
industrious
bee
and
i
do
not
know
them
all
each
has
her
own
tricks
her
own
art
of
injury
her
own
exterminating
tactics
so
that
no
part
of
the
mason
work
may
escape
destruction
some
seize
upon
the
victuals
others
feed
on
the
larvae
others
again
convert
the
dwelling
to
their
own
use
everything
has
to
submit
cell
provisions
nurselings
the
stealers
of
food
are
the
stelis
nasuta
and
the
dioxys
cincta
i
have
already
said
how
in
the
absence
the
stelis
perforates
the
dome
of
cell
after
cell
lays
her
eggs
there
and
afterwards
repairs
the
breach
with
a
mortar
made
of
red
earth
which
at
once
betrays
the
parasite
presence
to
a
watchful
eye
the
stelis
who
is
much
smaller
than
the
chalicodoma
finds
enough
food
in
a
single
cell
for
the
rearing
of
several
of
her
grubs
the
mother
lays
a
number
of
eggs
which
i
have
seen
vary
between
the
extremes
of
two
and
twelve
on
the
surface
next
to
the
mason
egg
which
itself
undergoes
no
outrage
whatever
things
do
not
go
so
badly
at
first
the
feasters
swim
it
is
the
only
word
in
the
midst
of
plenty
they
eat
and
digest
like
brothers
presently
times
become
hard
for
the
hostess
son
the
food
decreases
dearth
sets
in
and
at
length
not
an
atom
remains
although
the
larva
has
attained
at
most
a
quarter
of
its
growth
the
others
more
expeditious
feeders
have
exhausted
the
victuals
long
before
the
victim
has
finished
his
normal
repast
the
swindled
grub
shrivels
up
and
dies
while
the
gorged
larvae
of
the
stelis
begin
to
spin
their
strong
little
brown
cocoons
pressed
close
together
and
lumped
into
one
mass
so
as
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
scanty
space
in
the
crowded
dwelling
should
you
inspect
the
cell
later
you
will
find
between
the
heaped
cocoons
on
the
wall
a
little
corpse
it
is
the
larva
that
was
such
an
object
of
care
to
the
mother
mason
the
efforts
of
the
most
laborious
of
lives
have
ended
in
this
lamentable
relic
it
has
happened
to
me
just
as
often
when
examining
the
secrets
of
the
cell
which
is
at
once
cradle
and
tomb
not
to
come
upon
the
deceased
grub
at
all
i
picture
the
stelis
before
laying
her
own
eggs
destroying
the
chalicodoma
egg
and
eating
it
as
the
osmiae
do
among
themselves
or
i
picture
the
dying
thing
an
irksome
mass
for
the
numerous
spinners
at
work
in
a
narrow
habitation
being
cut
to
pieces
to
make
room
for
the
medley
of
cocoons
but
to
so
many
deeds
of
darkness
i
would
not
like
to
add
another
by
an
oversight
and
i
prefer
to
admit
that
i
failed
to
perceive
the
grub
that
died
of
hunger
let
us
now
show
up
the
dioxys
at
the
time
when
the
work
of
construction
is
in
progress
she
is
an
impudent
visitor
of
the
nests
exploiting
with
the
same
effrontery
the
enormous
cities
of
the
of
the
sheds
and
the
solitary
cupolas
of
the
of
the
pebbles
an
innumerable
population
coming
and
going
humming
and
buzzing
strikes
her
with
no
awe
on
the
tiles
hanging
from
the
walls
of
my
porch
i
see
her
with
her
red
scarf
round
her
body
stalking
with
sublime
assurance
over
the
ridged
expanse
of
nests
her
black
schemes
leave
the
swarm
profoundly
indifferent
not
one
of
the
workers
dreams
of
chasing
her
off
unless
she
should
come
bothering
too
closely
even
then
all
that
happens
is
a
few
signs
of
impatience
on
the
part
of
the
hustled
bee
there
is
no
serious
excitement
no
eager
pursuits
such
as
the
presence
of
a
mortal
enemy
might
lead
us
to
suspect
they
are
there
in
their
thousands
each
armed
with
her
dagger
any
one
of
them
is
capable
of
slaying
the
traitress
and
not
one
attacks
her
the
danger
is
not
suspected
meanwhile
she
inspects
the
workyard
moves
freely
among
the
ranks
of
the
masons
and
bides
her
time
if
the
owner
be
absent
i
see
her
diving
into
a
cell
coming
out
again
a
moment
later
with
her
mouth
smeared
with
pollen
she
has
been
to
try
the
provisions
a
dainty
connoisseur
she
goes
from
one
store
to
another
taking
a
mouthful
of
honey
is
it
a
tithe
for
her
personal
maintenance
or
a
sample
tested
for
the
benefit
of
her
coming
grub
i
should
not
like
to
say
what
i
do
know
is
that
after
a
certain
number
of
these
tastings
i
catch
her
stopping
in
a
cell
with
her
abdomen
at
the
bottom
and
her
head
at
the
orifice
this
is
the
moment
of
laying
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
when
the
parasite
is
gone
i
inspect
the
home
i
see
nothing
abnormal
on
the
surface
of
the
mass
the
sharper
eye
of
the
owner
when
she
gets
back
sees
nothing
either
for
she
continues
the
victualling
without
betraying
the
least
uneasiness
a
strange
egg
laid
on
the
provisions
would
not
escape
her
i
know
how
clean
she
keeps
her
warehouse
i
know
how
scrupulously
she
casts
out
anything
introduced
by
my
agency
an
egg
that
is
not
hers
a
bit
of
straw
a
grain
of
dust
so
according
to
my
evidence
and
that
of
the
chalicodoma
which
is
more
conclusive
the
dioxys
egg
if
it
is
really
laid
then
is
not
placed
on
the
surface
i
suspect
without
having
yet
verified
my
suspicion
and
i
reproach
myself
for
the
neglect
i
suspect
that
the
egg
is
buried
in
the
heap
of
when
i
see
the
dioxys
come
out
of
a
cell
with
her
mouth
all
over
yellow
flour
perhaps
she
has
been
surveying
the
ground
and
preparing
a
for
her
egg
what
i
take
for
a
mere
tasting
might
well
be
a
more
serious
act
thus
concealed
the
egg
escapes
the
eagle
eye
of
the
bee
whereas
if
left
uncovered
it
would
inevitably
perish
would
be
flung
on
the
rubbish
heap
at
once
by
the
owner
of
the
nest
when
the
spotted
sapyga
lays
her
egg
on
that
of
the
osmia
she
does
the
deed
under
cover
of
darkness
in
the
gloom
of
a
deep
well
to
which
not
the
least
ray
of
light
can
penetrate
and
the
mother
returning
with
her
pellet
of
green
putty
to
build
the
closing
partition
does
not
see
the
usurping
germ
and
is
ignorant
of
the
danger
but
here
everything
happens
in
broad
daylight
and
this
demands
more
cunning
in
the
method
of
installation
besides
it
is
the
one
favourable
moment
for
the
dioxys
if
she
waits
for
the
to
lay
it
is
too
late
for
the
parasite
is
not
able
to
break
down
doors
as
the
stelis
does
as
soon
as
her
egg
is
laid
the
of
the
sheds
comes
out
of
her
cell
and
at
once
turns
round
and
proceeds
to
close
it
up
with
the
pellet
of
mortar
which
she
holds
ready
in
her
mandibles
the
material
is
employed
with
such
method
that
the
actual
sealing
is
done
in
a
moment
the
other
pellets
the
object
of
repeated
journeys
will
serve
merely
to
increase
the
thickness
of
the
lid
the
chamber
is
inaccessible
to
the
dioxys
from
the
first
touch
of
the
trowel
hence
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
see
to
her
egg
before
the
of
the
sheds
has
disposed
of
hers
and
no
less
necessary
to
conceal
it
from
the
mason
watchful
eye
the
difficulties
are
not
so
great
in
the
nests
of
the
of
the
pebbles
after
this
bee
has
laid
her
egg
she
leaves
it
for
a
time
to
go
in
search
of
the
cement
needed
for
closing
the
cell
or
if
she
already
holds
a
pellet
in
her
mandibles
this
is
not
enough
to
seal
it
properly
as
the
orifice
is
larger
more
pellets
are
needed
to
wall
up
the
entrance
entirely
the
dioxys
would
have
time
to
strike
her
blow
during
the
mother
absences
but
everything
seems
to
suggest
that
she
behaves
on
the
pebbles
as
she
does
on
the
tiles
she
steals
a
march
by
hiding
the
egg
in
the
mass
of
pollen
and
honey
what
becomes
of
the
mason
egg
confined
in
the
same
cell
with
the
egg
of
the
dioxys
in
vain
have
i
opened
nests
at
every
season
i
have
never
found
a
vestige
of
the
egg
nor
of
the
grub
of
either
chalicodoma
the
dioxys
whether
as
a
larva
on
the
honey
or
enclosed
in
its
cocoon
or
as
the
perfect
insect
was
always
alone
the
rival
had
disappeared
without
a
trace
a
suspicion
thereupon
suggests
itself
and
the
facts
are
so
compelling
that
the
suspicion
is
almost
equal
to
a
certainty
the
parasitic
grub
which
hatches
earlier
than
the
other
emerges
from
its
from
the
midst
of
the
honey
comes
to
the
surface
and
with
its
first
bite
destroys
the
egg
of
the
as
the
sapyga
does
the
egg
of
the
osmia
it
is
an
odious
but
a
supremely
efficacious
method
nor
must
we
cry
out
too
loudly
against
such
foul
play
on
the
part
of
a
new
born
infant
we
shall
meet
with
even
more
heinous
tactics
later
the
criminal
records
of
life
are
full
of
these
horrors
which
we
dare
not
search
too
deeply
an
infinitesimal
creature
a
grub
with
the
of
its
egg
still
clinging
to
it
is
led
by
instinct
at
its
first
inspiration
to
exterminate
whatever
is
in
its
way
so
the
mason
egg
is
exterminated
was
it
really
necessary
in
the
dioxys
interest
not
in
the
least
the
hoard
of
provisions
is
too
large
for
its
requirements
in
a
cell
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
how
much
more
so
in
a
cell
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
pebbles
she
eats
not
a
half
hardly
a
third
of
it
the
rest
remains
as
it
was
untouched
we
see
here
in
the
destruction
of
the
mason
egg
a
flagrant
waste
which
aggravates
the
crime
hunger
excuses
many
things
for
lack
of
food
the
survivors
on
the
raft
of
the
medusa
indulged
in
a
little
cannibalism
but
here
there
is
enough
food
and
to
spare
when
there
is
more
than
she
needs
what
earthly
motive
impels
the
dioxys
to
destroy
a
rival
in
the
germ
stage
why
can
not
she
allow
the
larva
her
to
take
advantage
of
the
remains
and
afterwards
to
shift
for
itself
as
best
it
can
but
no
the
offspring
must
needs
be
stupidly
sacrificed
on
the
top
of
provisions
which
will
only
grow
mouldy
and
useless
i
should
be
reduced
to
the
gloomy
lucubrations
of
a
schopenhauer
if
i
once
let
myself
begin
on
parasitism
such
is
a
brief
sketch
of
the
two
parasites
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
pebbles
true
parasites
consumers
of
provisions
hoarded
on
behalf
of
others
their
crimes
are
not
the
bitterest
tribulations
of
the
if
the
first
starves
the
mason
grub
to
death
if
the
second
makes
it
perish
in
the
egg
there
are
others
who
have
a
more
pitiable
ending
in
store
for
the
worker
family
when
the
bee
grub
all
plump
and
fat
and
greasy
has
finished
its
provisions
and
spun
its
cocoon
wherein
to
sleep
the
slumber
akin
to
death
the
necessary
period
of
preparation
for
its
future
life
these
other
enemies
hasten
to
the
nests
whose
fortifications
are
powerless
against
their
hideously
ingenious
methods
soon
on
the
sleeper
body
lies
a
nascent
grub
which
feasts
in
all
security
on
the
luscious
fare
the
traitors
who
attack
the
larvae
in
their
lethargy
are
three
in
number
an
anthrax
a
leucopsis
and
a
microscopic
monodontomerus
cupreus
for
this
and
the
anthrax
cf
the
life
of
the
fly
chapters
and
the
leucopsis
is
a
hymenopteron
the
essay
upon
whom
forms
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
present
translator
note
their
story
deserves
to
be
told
without
reticence
and
i
shall
tell
it
later
for
the
moment
i
merely
mention
the
names
of
the
three
exterminators
the
provisions
are
stolen
the
egg
is
destroyed
the
young
grub
dies
of
hunger
the
larva
is
devoured
is
that
all
not
yet
the
worker
must
be
exploited
thoroughly
in
her
work
as
well
as
in
her
family
here
are
some
now
who
covet
her
dwelling
when
the
mason
is
constructing
a
new
edifice
on
a
pebble
her
almost
constant
presence
is
enough
to
keep
the
aspirants
to
free
lodgings
at
a
distance
her
strength
and
vigilance
overawe
whoso
would
annex
her
masonry
if
in
her
absence
one
greatly
daring
thinks
of
visiting
the
building
the
owner
soon
appears
upon
the
scene
and
ousts
her
with
the
most
discouraging
animosity
she
has
no
need
then
to
fear
the
entrance
of
unwelcome
tenants
while
the
house
is
new
but
the
bee
of
the
pebbles
also
uses
old
dwellings
for
her
laying
as
long
as
they
are
not
too
much
dilapidated
in
the
early
stages
of
the
work
neighbours
compete
for
these
with
an
eagerness
which
shows
the
value
attached
to
them
face
to
face
at
times
with
their
mandibles
interlocked
now
both
rising
into
the
air
now
coming
down
again
then
touching
ground
and
rolling
over
each
other
next
flying
up
again
for
hours
on
end
they
will
wage
battle
for
the
property
at
issue
a
nest
a
family
heirloom
which
needs
but
a
little
restoring
is
a
precious
thing
for
the
mason
ever
sparing
of
her
time
we
find
so
many
of
the
old
homes
repaired
and
restocked
that
i
suspect
the
bee
of
laying
new
foundations
only
when
there
are
no
secondhand
nests
to
be
had
to
have
the
chambers
of
a
dome
occupied
by
a
stranger
therefore
means
a
serious
privation
now
several
bees
however
industrious
in
gathering
honey
building
and
contriving
receptacles
for
provisions
are
less
clever
at
preparing
the
resorts
in
which
the
cells
are
to
be
stacked
the
abandoned
chambers
of
the
chalicodoma
now
larger
than
they
were
originally
through
the
addition
of
the
hall
of
exit
are
acquisitions
for
them
the
great
thing
is
to
occupy
these
chambers
first
for
here
possession
is
nine
parts
of
the
law
once
established
the
mason
is
not
disturbed
in
her
home
while
she
in
her
turn
does
not
disturb
the
stranger
who
has
settled
down
before
her
in
an
old
nest
the
patrimony
of
her
family
the
disinherited
one
leaves
the
bohemian
to
enjoy
the
ruined
manor
in
peace
and
goes
to
another
pebble
to
establish
herself
at
fresh
expense
in
the
first
rank
of
these
free
tenants
i
will
place
an
osmia
osmia
cyanoxantha
perez
and
a
megachile
or
bee
megachile
apicalis
spin
cf
and
others
chapter
translator
note
both
of
whom
work
in
may
at
the
same
time
as
the
mason
while
both
are
small
enough
to
lodge
from
five
to
eight
cells
in
a
single
chamber
of
the
chalicodoma
a
chamber
increased
by
the
addition
of
an
outer
hall
the
osmia
subdivides
this
space
into
very
irregular
compartments
by
means
of
slanting
upright
or
curved
partitions
subject
to
the
dictates
of
space
there
is
no
art
consequently
in
the
accumulation
of
little
cells
the
only
task
is
to
use
the
breadth
at
her
disposal
in
a
frugal
manner
the
material
employed
for
the
partitions
is
a
green
vegetable
putty
which
the
osmia
must
obtain
by
chewing
the
shredded
leaves
of
a
plant
whose
nature
is
still
uncertain
the
same
green
paste
serves
for
the
thick
plug
that
closes
the
abode
but
in
this
case
the
insect
does
not
use
it
unadulterated
to
give
greater
power
of
resistance
to
the
work
it
mixes
a
number
of
bits
of
gravel
with
the
vegetable
cement
these
materials
which
are
easily
picked
up
are
lavishly
employed
as
though
the
mother
feared
lest
she
should
not
fortify
sufficiently
the
entrance
to
her
dwelling
they
form
a
sort
of
coarse
stucco
on
the
more
or
less
smooth
cupola
of
the
chalicodoma
and
this
unevenness
as
well
as
the
green
colouring
of
its
mortar
of
masticated
leaves
at
once
betrays
the
osmia
nest
in
course
of
time
under
the
prolonged
action
of
the
air
the
vegetable
putty
turns
brown
and
assumes
a
tint
especially
on
the
outside
of
the
plug
and
it
would
then
be
difficult
for
any
one
who
had
not
seen
them
when
freshly
made
to
recognize
their
nature
the
old
nests
on
the
pebbles
seem
to
suit
other
osmiae
my
notes
mention
osmia
morawitzi
perez
and
osmia
cyanea
as
having
been
recognized
in
these
dwellings
although
they
are
not
very
assiduous
visitors
lastly
to
complete
the
enumeration
of
the
bees
known
to
me
as
making
their
homes
in
the
mason
cupolas
i
must
add
megachile
apicalis
who
piles
in
each
cell
a
or
more
constructed
with
disks
cut
from
the
leaves
of
the
wild
rose
and
an
anthidium
whose
species
i
can
not
state
having
seen
nothing
of
her
but
her
white
cotton
sacks
the
of
the
sheds
on
the
other
hand
supplies
free
lodgings
to
two
species
of
osmiae
osmia
tricornis
and
osmia
latreillii
both
of
whom
are
quite
common
the
osmia
frequents
by
preference
the
habitations
of
the
bees
that
build
their
nests
in
populous
colonies
such
as
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
and
the
anthophora
latreille
osmia
is
nearly
always
found
with
the
osmia
at
the
chalicodoma
the
real
builder
of
the
city
and
the
exploiter
of
the
labour
of
others
work
together
at
the
same
period
form
a
common
swarm
and
live
in
perfect
harmony
each
bee
of
the
two
species
attending
to
her
business
in
peace
they
share
and
share
alike
as
though
by
tacit
agreement
is
the
osmia
discreet
enough
not
to
put
upon
the
mason
and
to
utilize
only
abandoned
passages
and
waste
cells
or
does
she
take
possession
of
the
home
of
which
the
real
owners
could
themselves
have
made
use
i
lean
in
favour
of
usurpation
for
it
is
not
rare
to
see
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
clearing
out
old
cells
and
using
them
as
does
her
sister
of
the
pebbles
be
this
as
it
may
all
this
little
busy
world
lives
without
strife
some
building
anew
others
dividing
up
the
old
dwelling
those
osmiae
on
the
contrary
who
are
the
guests
of
the
of
the
pebbles
are
the
sole
occupants
of
the
dome
the
cause
of
this
isolation
lies
in
the
unsociable
temper
of
the
proprietress
the
old
nest
does
not
suit
her
from
the
moment
that
she
sees
it
occupied
by
another
instead
of
going
shares
she
prefers
to
seek
elsewhere
a
dwelling
where
she
can
work
in
solitude
her
gracious
surrender
of
a
most
excellent
lodging
in
favour
of
a
stranger
who
would
be
incapable
of
offering
the
least
resistance
if
a
dispute
arose
proves
the
great
immunity
enjoyed
by
the
osmia
in
the
home
of
the
worker
whom
she
exploits
the
common
and
peaceful
swarming
of
the
of
the
sheds
and
the
two
osmiae
proves
it
in
a
still
more
positive
fashion
there
is
never
a
fight
for
the
acquisition
of
another
goods
or
the
defence
of
one
own
property
never
a
brawl
between
osmiae
and
chalicodomae
robber
and
robbed
live
on
the
most
neighbourly
terms
the
osmia
considers
herself
at
home
and
the
other
does
nothing
to
undeceive
her
if
the
parasites
so
deadly
to
the
workers
move
about
in
their
very
ranks
with
impunity
without
arousing
the
faintest
excitement
an
equally
complete
indifference
must
be
shown
by
the
dispossessed
owners
to
the
presence
of
the
usurpers
in
their
old
homes
i
should
be
greatly
put
to
it
if
i
were
asked
to
reconcile
this
calmness
on
the
part
of
the
expropriated
one
with
the
ruthless
competition
that
is
said
to
sway
the
world
fashioned
so
as
to
instal
herself
in
the
mason
property
the
osmia
meets
with
a
peaceful
reception
from
her
my
feeble
eyes
can
see
no
further

proportions
the

threatens
the

with
a
speedy

it
is
time
to
abandon

good
the

its

thereupon
the
crumbling

i
have
said
nothing
yet
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
shrubs
my
silence
is
not
due
to
negligence
but
to
the
circumstance
that
i
am
almost
destitute
of
facts
relating
to
her
parasites
of
the
many
nests
which
i
have
opened
in
order
to
study
their
inhabitants
only
one
so
far
has
been
invaded
by
strangers
this
nest
the
size
of
a
large
walnut
was
fixed
on
a
it
comprised
eight
cells
of
which
seven
were
occupied
by
the
chalicodoma
and
the
eighth
by
a
little
chalcis
the
plague
of
a
whole
host
of
the
apart
from
this
instance
which
was
not
a
very
serious
case
i
have
seen
nothing
in
those
aerial
nests
swinging
at
the
end
of
a
twig
not
a
dioxys
a
stelis
an
anthrax
a
leucopsis
those
dread
ravagers
of
the
other
two
masons
never
any
osmiae
megachiles
or
anthidia
those
lodgers
in
the
old
buildings
the
absence
of
the
latter
is
easily
explained
the
chalicodoma
masonry
does
not
last
long
on
its
frail
support
the
winter
winds
when
the
shelter
of
the
foliage
has
disappeared
must
easily
break
the
twig
which
is
little
thicker
than
a
straw
and
liable
to
give
way
by
reason
of
its
heavy
burden
threatened
with
an
early
fall
if
it
is
not
already
on
the
ground
last
year
dwelling
is
not
restored
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
present
generation
the
same
nest
does
not
serve
twice
and
this
does
away
with
the
osmiae
and
with
their
rivals
in
the
art
of
utilizing
old
cells
the
elucidation
of
this
point
does
not
remove
the
obscurity
of
the
next
i
can
see
nothing
to
account
for
the
absence
or
at
least
the
extreme
rareness
of
usurpers
of
provisions
and
consumers
of
grubs
both
of
whom
are
very
indifferent
to
the
new
or
old
conditions
of
the
nest
so
long
as
the
cells
are
well
stocked
can
it
be
that
the
lofty
position
of
the
edifice
and
the
shaky
support
of
the
twig
arouse
distrust
in
the
dioxys
and
other
malefactors
for
lack
of
a
better
explanation
i
will
leave
it
at
that
if
my
idea
is
not
an
empty
fancy
we
must
admit
that
the
chalicodoma
of
the
shrubs
was
singularly
in
building
in
you
have
seen
of
what
misfortunes
the
other
two
are
victims
if
i
take
a
census
of
the
population
of
a
tile
many
a
time
i
find
the
dioxys
and
the
in
almost
equal
proportions
the
parasite
has
wiped
out
half
the
colony
to
complete
the
disaster
it
is
not
unusual
for
the
the
leucopsis
and
her
rival
the
pygmy
chalcis
to
have
decimated
the
other
half
i
say
nothing
of
anthrax
sinuata
whom
i
sometimes
see
coming
from
the
nests
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
her
larva
preys
on
the
osmia
the
visitor
all
solitary
though
she
be
on
her
boulder
which
would
seem
the
proper
thing
to
keep
away
exploiters
the
scourge
of
dense
populations
the
chalicodoma
of
the
pebbles
is
no
less
sorely
tried
my
notes
abound
in
cases
such
as
the
following
of
the
nine
cells
in
one
dome
three
are
occupied
by
the
anthrax
two
by
the
leucopsis
two
by
the
stelis
one
by
the
chalcis
and
the
ninth
by
the
mason
it
is
as
though
the
four
miscreants
had
joined
forces
for
the
massacre
the
whole
of
the
family
has
disappeared
all
but
one
young
mother
saved
from
the
disaster
by
her
position
in
the
centre
of
the
citadel
i
have
sometimes
stuffed
my
pockets
with
nests
removed
from
their
pebbles
without
finding
a
single
one
that
has
not
been
violated
by
one
or
other
of
the
malefactors
and
oftener
still
by
several
of
them
at
a
time
it
is
almost
an
event
for
me
to
find
a
nest
intact
after
these
funereal
records
i
am
haunted
by
a
gloomy
thought
the
weal
of
one
means
the
woe
of
another
chapter
the
leucopses
this
chapter
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
essays
entitled
the
anthrax
and
larval
dimorphism
forming
chapters
and
of
the
life
of
the
fly
translator
note
let
us
visit
the
nests
of
chalicodoma
muraria
in
july
detaching
them
from
their
pebbles
with
a
sideward
blow
as
i
explained
when
telling
the
story
of
the
anthrax
the
cocoons
with
two
inhabitants
one
devouring
the
other
in
process
of
being
devoured
are
numerous
enough
to
allow
me
to
gather
some
dozens
in
the
course
of
a
morning
before
the
sun
becomes
unbearably
hot
we
will
give
a
smart
tap
to
the
flints
so
as
to
loosen
the
clay
domes
wrap
these
up
in
newspapers
fill
our
box
and
go
home
as
fast
as
we
can
for
the
air
will
soon
be
as
fiery
as
the
devil
kitchen
inspection
which
is
easier
in
the
shade
indoors
soon
tells
us
that
though
the
devoured
is
always
the
wretched
the
devourer
belongs
to
two
different
species
in
the
one
case
the
cylindrical
form
the
colouring
and
the
little
nipple
constituting
the
head
reveal
to
us
the
larva
of
the
anthrax
which
does
not
concern
us
at
present
in
the
other
the
general
structure
and
appearance
betray
the
grub
of
some
hymenopteron
the
mason
second
exterminator
is
in
fact
a
leucopsis
leucopsis
gigas
fab
a
magnificent
insect
stripped
black
and
yellow
with
an
abdomen
rounded
at
the
end
and
hollowed
out
as
is
also
the
back
into
a
groove
to
contain
a
long
rapier
as
slender
as
a
horsehair
which
the
creature
unsheathes
and
drives
through
the
mortar
right
into
the
cell
where
it
proposes
to
establish
its
egg
before
occupying
ourselves
with
its
capacities
as
an
inoculator
let
us
learn
how
its
larva
lives
in
the
invaded
cell
it
is
a
hairless
legless
sightless
grub
easily
confused
by
inexperienced
eyes
with
those
of
various
hymenoptera
its
more
apparent
characteristics
consist
of
a
colouring
like
that
of
rancid
butter
a
shiny
and
as
it
were
oily
skin
and
a
segmentation
accentuated
by
a
series
of
marked
swellings
so
that
when
looked
at
from
the
side
the
back
is
very
plainly
indented
when
at
rest
the
larva
is
like
a
bow
bending
round
at
one
point
it
is
made
up
of
thirteen
segments
including
the
head
this
head
which
is
very
small
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
body
displays
no
under
the
lens
at
most
you
see
a
faint
red
streak
which
calls
for
the
microscope
you
then
distinguish
two
delicate
mandibles
very
short
and
fashioned
into
a
sharp
point
a
small
round
mouth
with
a
fine
piercer
on
the
right
and
left
is
all
that
the
powerful
instrument
reveals
as
for
my
best
single
they
show
me
nothing
at
all
on
the
other
hand
we
can
quite
easily
without
arming
the
eye
with
a
lens
perceive
the
and
particularly
the
mandibles
of
either
a
such
as
an
osmia
chalicodoma
or
megachile
or
a
such
as
a
scolia
ammophila
or
bembex
all
these
possess
stout
pincers
capable
of
gripping
grinding
and
tearing
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
leucopsis
invisible
implements
his
method
of
consuming
will
tell
us
like
his
prototype
the
anthrax
the
leucopsis
does
not
eat
the
that
is
to
say
he
does
not
break
it
up
into
mouthfuls
he
drains
it
without
opening
it
and
digging
into
its
vitals
in
him
again
we
see
exemplified
that
marvellous
art
which
consists
in
feeding
on
the
victim
without
killing
it
until
the
meal
is
over
so
as
always
to
have
a
portion
of
fresh
meat
with
its
mouth
assiduously
applied
to
the
unhappy
creature
skin
the
lethal
grub
fills
itself
and
waxes
fat
while
the
fostering
larva
collapses
and
shrivels
retaining
just
enough
life
however
to
resist
decomposition
all
that
remains
of
the
decanted
corpse
is
the
skin
which
when
softened
in
water
and
blown
out
swells
into
a
balloon
without
the
least
escape
of
gas
thus
proving
the
continuity
of
the
integument
all
the
same
the
apparently
unpunctured
bladder
has
lost
its
contents
it
is
a
repetition
of
what
the
anthrax
has
shown
us
with
this
difference
that
the
leucopsis
seems
not
so
well
skilled
in
the
delicate
work
of
absorbing
the
victim
instead
of
the
clean
white
granule
which
is
the
sole
residue
when
the
fly
has
finished
her
joint
the
insect
with
the
long
probe
has
a
plateful
of
leavings
not
seldom
soiled
with
the
brownish
tinge
of
food
that
has
gone
bad
it
would
seem
that
towards
the
end
the
act
of
consumption
becomes
more
savage
and
does
not
disdain
dead
meat
i
also
notice
that
the
leucopsis
is
not
able
to
get
up
from
dinner
or
to
sit
down
to
it
again
as
readily
as
the
anthrax
i
have
sometimes
to
tease
him
with
the
point
of
a
in
order
to
make
him
let
go
and
once
he
has
left
the
joint
he
hesitates
a
little
before
putting
his
mouth
to
it
again
his
adhesion
is
not
the
mere
result
of
a
kiss
like
that
of
a
it
can
only
be
explained
by
hooks
that
need
releasing
i
now
see
the
use
of
the
microscopic
mandibles
those
two
delicate
spikes
are
incapable
of
chewing
anything
but
they
may
very
well
serve
to
pierce
the
epidermis
with
an
aperture
smaller
than
that
made
by
the
finest
needle
and
it
is
through
this
puncture
that
the
leucopsis
sucks
the
juices
of
his
prey
they
are
instruments
made
to
perforate
the
bag
of
fat
which
slowly
without
suffering
any
internal
injury
is
emptied
through
an
opening
repeated
here
and
there
the
anthrax
is
here
replaced
by
piercers
of
exceeding
sharpness
and
so
short
that
they
can
not
hurt
anything
beyond
the
skin
thus
do
we
see
in
operation
with
a
different
sort
of
implements
that
wise
system
which
keeps
the
provisions
fresh
for
the
consumer
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
to
those
who
have
read
the
story
of
the
anthrax
that
this
kind
of
feeding
would
be
impossible
with
a
victim
whose
tissues
possessed
their
final
hardness
the
grub
is
therefore
emptied
by
the
leucopsis
larva
while
it
is
in
a
semifluid
state
and
deep
in
the
torpor
of
the
nymphosis
the
last
fortnight
in
july
and
the
first
fortnight
in
august
are
the
best
times
to
witness
the
repast
which
i
have
seen
going
on
for
twelve
and
fourteen
days
later
we
find
nothing
in
the
cocoon
except
the
leucopsis
larva
gloriously
fat
and
by
its
side
a
sort
of
thin
rancid
rasher
the
remains
of
the
deceased
things
then
remain
as
they
are
until
the
hot
part
of
the
following
summer
or
at
least
until
the
end
of
june
then
appears
the
nymph
which
teaches
us
nothing
striking
and
at
last
the
perfect
insect
whose
hatching
may
be
delayed
until
august
its
exit
from
the
mason
fortress
has
no
likeness
to
the
strange
method
employed
by
the
anthrax
endowed
with
stout
mandibles
the
perfect
insect
splits
the
ceiling
of
its
abode
by
itself
without
much
difficulty
at
the
time
of
its
deliverance
the
who
work
in
may
have
long
disappeared
the
nests
on
the
pebbles
are
all
closed
the
provisioning
is
finished
the
larvae
are
sleeping
in
their
yellow
cocoons
as
the
old
nests
are
utilized
by
the
mason
so
long
as
they
are
not
too
much
dilapidated
the
dome
which
has
just
been
vacated
by
the
leucopsis
now
more
than
a
year
old
has
its
other
cells
occupied
by
the
children
there
is
here
without
seeking
farther
a
fat
living
for
the
leucopsis
offspring
which
she
well
knows
how
to
turn
to
profit
it
depends
but
on
herself
to
make
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
into
the
residence
of
her
family
besides
if
she
has
a
fancy
for
distant
exploration
clay
domes
abound
in
the
harmas
the
inoculation
of
the
eggs
through
the
walls
will
begin
shortly
before
witnessing
this
curious
performance
let
us
examine
the
needle
that
is
to
effect
it
the
insect
abdomen
is
hollowed
at
the
top
into
a
furrow
that
runs
up
to
the
base
of
the
thorax
the
end
which
is
broader
and
rounded
has
a
narrow
slit
which
seems
to
divide
this
region
into
two
the
whole
thing
suggests
a
pulley
with
a
fine
groove
when
at
rest
the
or
ovipositor
remains
packed
in
the
slit
and
the
furrow
the
delicate
instrument
thus
almost
completely
encircles
the
abdomen
underneath
on
the
median
line
we
see
a
long
scale
pointed
fixed
by
its
base
to
the
first
abdominal
segment
with
its
sides
prolonged
into
membranous
wings
which
are
fastened
tightly
to
the
insect
flanks
its
function
is
to
protect
the
underlying
region
a
region
in
which
the
probe
has
its
source
it
is
a
cuirass
a
lid
which
protects
the
delicate
during
periods
of
inactivity
but
swings
from
back
to
front
and
lifts
when
the
implement
has
to
be
unsheathed
and
used
we
will
now
remove
this
lid
with
the
scissors
so
as
to
have
the
whole
apparatus
before
our
eyes
and
then
raise
the
ovipositor
with
the
point
of
a
needle
the
part
that
runs
along
the
back
comes
loose
without
the
slightest
difficulty
but
the
part
embedded
in
the
groove
at
the
end
of
the
abdomen
offers
a
resistance
that
warns
us
of
a
complication
which
we
did
not
notice
at
first
the
tool
in
fact
consists
of
three
pieces
a
central
piece
or
and
two
which
together
constitute
a
scabbard
the
two
latter
are
more
substantial
are
hollowed
out
like
the
sides
of
a
groove
and
when
uniting
form
a
complete
groove
in
which
the
filament
is
sheathed
this
bivalvular
scabbard
adheres
loosely
to
the
dorsal
part
but
farther
on
at
the
tip
of
the
abdomen
and
under
the
belly
it
can
no
longer
be
detached
as
its
valves
are
welded
to
the
abdominal
wall
here
therefore
we
find
between
the
two
joined
protecting
parts
a
simple
trench
in
which
the
filament
lies
covered
up
as
for
this
filament
it
is
easily
extracted
from
its
sheath
and
released
down
to
its
base
under
the
shield
formed
by
the
scale
seen
under
the
it
is
a
round
stiff
horny
thread
midway
in
thickness
between
a
human
hair
and
a
its
tip
is
a
little
rough
pointed
and
bevelled
to
some
length
down
the
microscope
becomes
necessary
if
we
would
see
its
real
structure
which
is
much
less
simple
than
it
at
first
appears
we
perceive
that
the
bevelled
consists
of
a
series
of
truncated
cones
fitting
one
into
the
other
with
their
wide
base
slightly
projecting
this
arrangement
produces
a
sort
of
file
a
sort
of
rasp
with
very
much
blunted
teeth
when
pressed
on
the
slide
the
thread
divides
into
four
pieces
of
unequal
length
the
two
longer
end
in
the
toothed
bevel
they
come
together
in
a
very
narrow
groove
which
receives
the
two
other
rather
shorter
pieces
these
both
end
in
a
point
which
however
is
not
toothed
and
does
not
project
as
far
as
the
final
rasp
they
also
unite
to
form
a
groove
which
fits
into
the
groove
of
the
other
two
the
whole
constituting
a
complete
channel
or
duct
moreover
the
two
shorter
pieces
considered
together
can
move
lengthwise
in
the
groove
that
receives
them
they
can
also
move
one
over
the
other
always
lengthwise
so
much
so
that
on
the
slide
of
the
microscope
their
terminal
points
are
seldom
situated
on
the
same
level
if
with
our
scissors
we
cut
a
piece
of
the
from
the
living
insect
and
examine
the
section
under
the
we
shall
see
the
inner
groove
lengthen
out
and
project
beyond
the
outer
groove
and
then
go
in
again
in
turn
while
from
the
wound
there
oozes
a
tiny
albimunous
drop
doubtless
proceeding
from
the
liquid
that
gives
the
egg
the
singular
appendage
to
which
we
shall
come
presently
by
means
of
these
longitudinal
movements
of
the
inner
trench
inside
the
outer
trench
and
of
the
sliding
one
over
the
other
of
the
two
portions
of
the
former
the
egg
can
be
despatched
to
the
end
of
the
ovipositor
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
any
muscular
contraction
which
is
impossible
in
a
horny
conduit
we
have
only
to
press
the
upper
surface
of
the
abdomen
to
see
it
disjoint
itself
from
the
first
segment
as
though
the
insect
had
been
cut
almost
in
two
at
that
point
a
wide
gap
or
hiatus
appears
between
the
first
and
second
rings
and
under
a
thin
membrane
the
base
of
the
ovipositor
bulges
out
bent
back
into
a
stout
hook
here
the
filament
passes
through
the
insect
from
end
to
end
and
emerges
underneath
its
issue
is
therefore
near
the
base
of
the
abdomen
instead
of
at
the
tip
as
usual
this
curious
arrangement
has
the
effect
of
shortening
the
of
the
ovipositor
and
bringing
the
of
the
filament
nearer
to
the
fulcrum
namely
the
legs
of
the
insect
and
of
thus
assisting
the
difficult
task
of
inoculation
by
making
the
most
of
the
effort
expended
to
sum
up
the
ovipositor
when
at
rest
goes
round
the
abdomen
starting
at
the
base
on
the
lower
surface
it
runs
round
the
belly
from
front
to
back
and
then
returns
from
back
to
front
on
the
upper
surface
where
it
ends
at
almost
the
same
level
as
its
its
length
is
millimetres
inch
translator
note
this
fixes
the
limit
of
the
depth
which
the
probe
is
able
to
reach
in
the
nests
one
last
word
on
the
leucopsis
weapon
in
the
dying
insect
beheaded
stripped
of
legs
and
wings
with
a
pin
stuck
through
its
body
the
sides
of
the
fissure
containing
the
quiver
violently
as
if
the
belly
were
going
to
open
divide
in
two
along
the
median
line
and
then
reunite
its
two
halves
the
thread
itself
gives
convulsive
tremblings
it
comes
out
of
its
scabbard
goes
back
and
slips
out
again
it
is
as
though
the
could
not
persuade
itself
to
die
before
accomplishing
its
mission
the
insect
supreme
aim
is
the
egg
and
so
long
as
the
least
spark
of
life
remains
it
makes
dying
efforts
to
lay
leucopsis
gigas
exploits
the
nests
of
the
of
the
pebbles
and
the
of
the
sheds
with
equal
zest
to
observe
the
insertion
of
the
egg
at
my
ease
and
to
watch
the
operator
at
work
over
and
over
again
i
gave
the
preference
to
the
mason
whose
nests
removed
from
the
neighbouring
roofs
by
my
orders
have
hung
for
some
years
in
the
arch
of
my
basement
these
clay
hives
fastened
to
tiles
supply
me
with
fresh
records
each
summer
i
am
much
indebted
to
them
in
the
matter
of
the
leucopsis
by
way
of
comparison
with
what
took
place
under
my
roof
i
used
to
observe
the
same
scenes
on
the
pebbles
of
the
surrounding
wastelands
my
excursions
alas
did
not
all
reward
my
zeal
which
zeal
was
not
without
merit
in
the
merciless
sunshine
but
still
at
rare
intervals
i
succeeded
in
seeing
some
leucopsis
digging
her
probe
into
the
mortar
dome
lying
flat
on
the
ground
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
operation
which
sometimes
lasted
for
hours
i
closely
watched
the
insect
in
its
every
movement
while
my
dog
weary
of
being
out
of
doors
in
that
scorching
heat
would
discreetly
retire
from
the
fray
and
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
his
tongue
hanging
out
go
home
and
stretch
himself
at
full
length
on
the
cool
tiles
of
the
hall
how
wise
he
was
to
scorn
this
i
would
come
in
as
brown
as
a
berry
to
find
my
friend
bull
wedged
into
a
corner
his
back
to
the
wall
sprawling
on
all
fours
while
with
heaving
sides
he
panted
forth
the
last
sprays
of
steam
from
his
overheated
interior
yes
he
was
much
to
return
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
shade
of
the
house
why
does
man
want
to
know
things
why
is
he
not
indifferent
to
them
with
the
lofty
philosophy
of
the
animals
what
interest
can
anything
have
for
us
that
does
not
fill
our
stomachs
what
is
the
use
of
learning
what
is
the
use
of
truth
when
profit
is
all
that
matters
why
am
i
the
descendant
so
they
tell
me
of
some
tertiary
baboon
afflicted
with
the
passion
for
knowledge
from
which
bull
my
friend
and
companion
is
exempt
why
oh
where
have
i
got
to
i
was
going
in
was
i
with
a
splitting
headache
quick
let
us
get
back
to
our
subject
it
was
in
the
first
week
of
july
that
i
saw
the
inoculation
begin
on
my
chalicodoma
sicula
nests
the
parasite
is
at
her
task
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
close
on
three
in
the
afternoon
and
work
goes
on
almost
to
the
end
of
the
month
decreasing
gradually
in
activity
i
count
as
many
as
twelve
leucopses
at
a
time
on
the
most
pair
of
tiles
the
insect
slowly
and
awkwardly
explores
the
nests
it
feels
the
surface
with
its
antennae
which
are
bent
at
a
right
angle
after
the
first
joint
then
motionless
with
lowered
head
it
seems
to
meditate
and
to
debate
within
itself
on
the
fitness
of
the
spot
is
it
here
or
somewhere
else
that
the
coveted
larva
lies
there
is
nothing
outside
absolutely
nothing
to
tell
us
it
is
a
stony
expanse
bumpy
but
yet
very
uniform
in
appearance
for
the
cells
have
disappeared
under
a
layer
of
plaster
a
work
of
public
interest
to
which
the
whole
swarm
devotes
its
last
days
if
i
myself
with
my
long
experience
had
to
decide
upon
the
suitable
point
even
if
i
were
at
liberty
to
make
use
of
a
lens
for
examining
the
mortar
grain
by
grain
and
to
auscultate
the
surface
in
order
to
gather
information
from
the
sound
emitted
i
should
decline
the
job
persuaded
in
advance
that
i
should
fail
nine
times
out
of
ten
and
only
succeed
by
chance
where
my
discernment
aided
by
reason
and
my
optical
contrivances
fails
the
insect
guided
by
the
wands
of
its
antennae
never
blunders
its
choice
is
made
see
it
unsheathing
its
long
instrument
the
probe
points
normally
towards
the
surface
and
occupies
nearly
the
central
spot
between
the
two
a
wide
dislocation
appears
on
the
back
between
the
first
and
second
segments
of
the
abdomen
and
the
base
of
the
instrument
swells
like
a
bladder
through
this
opening
while
the
point
strives
to
penetrate
the
hard
clay
the
amount
of
energy
expended
is
shown
by
the
way
in
which
the
bladder
quivers
at
every
moment
we
expect
to
see
the
frail
membrane
burst
with
the
violence
of
the
effort
but
it
does
not
give
way
and
the
wire
goes
deeper
and
deeper
raising
itself
high
on
its
legs
to
give
free
play
to
its
apparatus
the
insect
remains
motionless
the
only
sign
of
its
arduous
labours
being
a
slight
vibration
i
see
some
perforators
who
have
finished
operating
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
these
are
the
quickest
at
the
business
they
have
been
lucky
enough
to
come
across
a
wall
which
is
less
thick
and
less
hard
than
usual
i
see
others
who
spend
as
many
as
three
hours
on
a
single
operation
three
long
hours
of
patient
watching
for
me
in
my
anxiety
to
follow
the
whole
performance
to
the
end
three
long
hours
of
immobility
for
the
insect
which
is
even
more
anxious
to
make
sure
of
board
and
lodging
for
its
egg
but
then
is
it
not
a
task
of
the
utmost
difficulty
to
introduce
a
hair
into
the
thickness
of
a
stone
to
us
with
all
the
dexterity
of
our
fingers
it
would
be
impossible
to
the
insect
which
simply
pushes
with
its
belly
it
is
just
hard
work
notwithstanding
the
resistance
of
the
substance
traversed
the
leucopsis
perseveres
certain
of
succeeding
and
she
does
succeed
although
i
am
still
unable
to
understand
her
success
the
material
through
which
the
probe
has
to
penetrate
is
not
a
porous
substance
it
is
homogeneous
and
compact
like
our
hardened
cement
in
vain
do
i
direct
my
attention
to
the
exact
point
where
the
instrument
is
at
work
i
see
no
fissure
no
opening
that
can
facilitate
access
a
miner
drill
penetrates
the
rock
only
by
pulverizing
it
this
method
is
not
admissible
here
the
extreme
delicacy
of
the
implement
is
opposed
to
it
the
frail
stem
requires
so
it
seems
to
me
a
way
a
crevice
through
which
it
can
slip
but
this
crevice
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
what
about
a
dissolving
fluid
which
would
soften
the
mortar
under
the
point
of
the
ovipositor
no
for
i
see
not
a
trace
of
humidity
around
the
point
where
the
thread
is
at
work
i
fall
back
upon
a
fissure
a
lack
of
continuity
somewhere
although
my
examination
fails
to
discover
any
on
the
nest
i
was
better
served
in
another
case
leucopsis
dorsigera
settles
her
eggs
on
the
larva
of
the
diadem
anthidium
who
sometimes
makes
her
nest
in
i
have
repeatedly
seen
her
insert
her
auger
through
a
slight
rupture
in
the
side
of
the
reed
as
the
wall
was
different
wood
in
the
latter
case
and
mortar
in
the
former
perhaps
it
will
be
best
to
look
upon
the
matter
as
a
mystery
my
sedulous
attendance
during
the
best
part
of
july
in
front
of
the
tiles
hanging
from
the
walls
of
the
arch
allowed
me
to
reckon
the
inoculations
each
time
that
the
insect
on
finishing
the
operation
removed
its
probe
i
marked
in
pencil
the
exact
point
at
which
the
instrument
was
withdrawn
and
i
wrote
down
the
date
beside
it
this
information
was
to
be
utilized
when
the
leucopsis
finished
her
labours
when
the
perforators
are
gone
i
proceed
with
my
examination
of
the
nests
covered
with
my
hieroglyphics
the
pencilled
notes
one
result
one
which
i
fully
expected
compensates
me
straightway
for
all
my
weary
waitings
under
each
spot
marked
in
black
under
each
spot
whence
i
saw
the
ovipositor
withdrawn
i
always
find
a
cell
with
not
a
single
exception
and
yet
there
are
intervals
of
solid
stone
between
the
cells
the
alone
would
account
for
some
moreover
the
compartments
which
are
very
irregularly
disposed
by
a
swarm
of
toilers
who
all
work
in
their
own
sweet
way
have
great
irregular
cavities
between
them
which
end
by
being
filled
up
with
the
general
plastering
of
the
nest
the
result
of
this
arrangement
is
that
the
massive
portions
cover
almost
the
same
space
as
the
hollow
portions
there
is
nothing
outside
to
show
whether
the
underlying
regions
are
full
or
empty
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
decide
if
by
digging
straight
down
i
shall
come
to
a
hollow
cell
or
to
a
solid
wall
but
the
insect
makes
no
mistake
the
excavations
under
my
bear
witness
to
that
it
always
directs
its
apparatus
towards
the
hollow
of
a
cell
how
is
it
apprised
whether
the
part
below
is
empty
or
full
its
organs
of
information
are
undoubtedly
the
antennae
which
feel
the
ground
they
are
two
fingers
of
unparalleled
delicacy
which
pry
into
the
basement
by
tapping
on
the
part
above
it
then
what
do
those
puzzling
organs
perceive
a
smell
not
at
all
i
always
had
my
doubts
of
that
and
now
i
am
certain
of
the
contrary
after
what
i
shall
describe
in
a
moment
do
they
perceive
a
sound
are
we
to
treat
them
as
a
superior
kind
of
microphone
capable
of
collecting
the
infinitesimal
echoes
of
what
is
full
and
the
reverberations
of
what
is
empty
it
is
an
attractive
idea
but
unfortunately
the
antennae
play
their
part
equally
well
on
a
host
of
occasions
when
there
are
no
vaults
to
reverberate
we
know
nothing
and
are
perhaps
destined
never
to
know
anything
of
the
real
value
of
the
antennal
sense
to
which
we
have
nothing
analogous
but
though
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
say
what
it
does
perceive
we
are
at
least
able
to
recognize
to
some
extent
what
it
does
not
perceive
and
in
particular
to
deny
it
the
faculty
of
smell
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
notice
with
extreme
surprise
that
the
great
majority
of
the
cells
visited
by
the
leucopsis
probe
do
not
contain
the
one
thing
which
the
insect
is
seeking
namely
the
young
larva
of
the
enclosed
in
its
cocoon
their
contents
consist
of
the
refuse
so
often
met
with
in
old
liquid
honey
left
unemployed
because
the
egg
has
perished
spoilt
provisions
sometimes
mildewed
or
sometimes
a
tarry
mass
a
dead
larva
stiffened
into
a
brown
cylinder
the
shrivelled
corpse
of
a
perfect
insect
which
lacked
the
strength
to
effect
its
deliverance
dust
and
rubbish
which
has
come
from
the
afterwards
closed
up
by
the
outer
coating
of
plaster
the
odoriferous
effluvia
that
can
emanate
from
these
relics
certainly
possess
very
diverse
characters
a
sense
of
smell
with
any
subtlety
at
all
would
not
be
deceived
by
this
stuff
sour
musty
or
tarry
as
the
case
may
be
each
compartment
according
to
its
contents
has
a
special
aroma
which
we
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
perceive
and
this
aroma
most
certainly
bears
no
resemblance
to
that
which
we
may
assume
the
fresh
larva
to
possess
if
nevertheless
the
leucopsis
does
not
distinguish
between
these
various
cells
and
drives
the
probe
into
all
of
them
indifferently
is
this
not
an
evident
proof
that
smell
is
no
guide
whatever
to
her
in
her
search
other
considerations
when
i
was
treating
of
the
hairy
ammophila
enabled
me
to
assert
that
the
antennae
have
no
olfactory
powers
the
frequent
mistakes
of
the
leucopsis
whose
antennae
are
nevertheless
constantly
exploring
the
surface
make
this
conclusion
absolutely
certain
the
perforator
of
clay
nests
has
so
it
seems
to
me
delivered
us
from
an
old
physiological
fallacy
she
would
deserve
studying
if
for
no
other
result
than
this
but
her
interest
is
far
from
being
exhausted
let
us
look
at
her
from
another
point
of
view
whose
full
importance
will
not
be
apparent
until
the
end
let
us
speak
of
something
which
i
was
very
far
from
suspecting
when
i
was
so
assiduously
watching
the
nests
of
my
the
same
cell
can
receive
the
leucopsis
probe
a
number
of
times
at
intervals
of
several
days
i
have
said
how
i
used
to
mark
in
black
the
exact
place
at
which
the
had
entered
and
how
i
wrote
the
date
of
the
operation
beside
it
well
at
many
of
these
already
visited
spots
concerning
which
i
possessed
the
most
authentic
documents
i
saw
the
insect
return
a
second
a
third
and
even
a
fourth
time
either
on
the
same
day
or
some
while
after
and
drive
its
in
again
at
precisely
the
same
place
as
though
nothing
had
happened
was
it
the
same
individual
repeating
her
operation
in
a
cell
which
she
had
visited
before
but
forgotten
or
different
individuals
coming
one
after
the
other
to
lay
an
egg
in
a
compartment
thought
to
be
unoccupied
i
can
not
say
having
neglected
to
mark
the
operators
for
fear
of
disturbing
them
as
there
is
nothing
except
the
mark
of
my
pencil
a
mark
devoid
of
meaning
to
the
insect
to
indicate
that
the
auger
has
already
been
at
work
there
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
same
operator
finding
under
her
feet
a
spot
already
exploited
by
herself
but
effaced
from
her
memory
repeats
the
thrust
of
her
tool
in
a
compartment
which
she
believes
herself
to
be
discovering
for
the
first
time
however
retentive
its
memory
for
places
may
be
we
can
not
admit
that
the
insect
remembers
for
weeks
on
end
as
well
as
point
by
point
the
topography
of
a
nest
covering
a
surface
of
some
square
yards
its
recollections
if
it
have
any
serve
it
badly
the
outward
appearance
gives
it
no
information
and
its
drill
enters
wherever
it
may
happen
to
discover
a
cell
at
points
that
have
already
perhaps
been
pierced
several
times
over
it
may
also
happen
and
this
appears
to
me
the
most
frequent
case
that
one
exploiter
of
a
cell
is
succeeded
by
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
and
others
still
all
fired
with
the
newcomer
zeal
because
their
predecessors
have
left
no
trace
of
their
passage
in
one
way
or
another
the
same
cell
is
exposed
to
manifold
layings
though
its
contents
the
be
only
the
bare
ration
of
a
single
these
reiterated
borings
are
not
at
all
rare
i
noted
a
score
of
them
on
my
tiles
and
in
the
case
of
some
cells
the
operation
was
repeated
before
my
eyes
as
often
as
four
times
nothing
tells
us
that
this
number
was
not
exceeded
in
my
absence
the
little
that
i
observed
prevents
me
from
fixing
any
limit
and
now
a
momentous
question
arises
is
the
egg
really
laid
each
time
that
the
probe
enters
a
cell
i
can
see
not
the
slightest
excuse
for
supposing
the
contrary
the
ovipositor
because
of
its
horny
nature
can
have
but
a
very
dull
sense
of
touch
the
insect
is
apprised
of
the
contents
of
the
cell
only
by
the
end
of
that
long
a
not
very
trustworthy
witness
i
should
imagine
the
absence
of
resistance
tells
it
that
it
has
reached
an
empty
space
and
this
is
probably
the
only
information
that
the
insensible
implement
can
supply
the
drill
boring
through
the
rock
can
not
tell
the
miner
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
cavern
which
it
has
entered
and
the
case
must
be
the
same
with
the
rigid
filament
of
the
leucopses
now
that
the
thread
has
reached
its
goal
what
does
the
cell
contain
mildewed
honey
dust
and
rubbish
a
shrivelled
larva
or
a
larva
in
good
condition
above
all
does
it
already
contain
an
egg
this
last
question
calls
for
a
definite
answer
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
impossible
for
the
insect
to
learn
anything
from
a
on
that
most
delicate
matter
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
egg
a
mere
atom
of
a
thing
in
that
vast
apartment
even
admitting
some
sense
of
touch
at
the
end
of
the
drill
one
insuperable
difficulty
would
always
remain
that
of
finding
the
exact
spot
where
the
tiny
speck
lies
in
those
spacious
and
mysterious
regions
i
go
so
far
as
to
believe
that
the
ovipositor
tells
the
insect
nothing
or
at
any
rate
very
little
of
the
inside
of
the
cell
whether
propitious
or
not
to
the
development
of
the
germ
perhaps
each
thrust
of
the
instrument
provided
that
it
meets
with
no
resistance
from
solid
matter
lays
the
egg
to
whose
lot
there
falls
at
one
time
good
wholesome
food
at
another
mere
refuse
these
anomalies
call
for
more
conclusive
proofs
than
the
rough
deductions
drawn
from
the
nature
of
the
horny
ovipositor
we
must
ascertain
in
a
direct
fashion
whether
the
cell
into
which
the
auger
has
been
driven
several
times
over
actually
contains
several
occupants
in
addition
to
the
larva
of
the
when
the
leucopses
had
finished
their
borings
i
waited
a
few
days
longer
so
as
to
give
the
young
grubs
time
to
develop
a
little
which
would
make
my
examination
easier
i
then
moved
the
tiles
to
the
table
in
my
study
in
order
to
investigate
their
secrets
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
and
here
such
a
disappointment
as
i
have
rarely
known
awaited
me
the
cells
which
i
had
seen
actually
seen
with
my
own
eyes
pierced
by
the
probe
two
or
three
or
even
four
times
contained
but
one
one
alone
eating
away
at
its
chalicodoma
others
which
had
also
been
repeatedly
probed
contained
spoilt
remnants
but
never
a
leucopsis
o
holy
patience
give
me
the
courage
to
begin
again
dispel
the
darkness
and
deliver
me
from
doubt
i
begin
again
the
is
familiar
to
me
i
can
recognize
it
without
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
in
the
nests
of
both
the
chalicodoma
of
the
pebbles
and
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
all
through
the
winter
i
rush
about
getting
my
nests
from
the
roofs
of
old
sheds
and
the
pebbles
of
the
i
stuff
my
pockets
with
them
fill
my
box
load
favier
knapsack
i
collect
enough
to
litter
all
the
tables
in
my
study
and
when
it
is
too
cold
out
of
doors
when
the
biting
mistral
blows
i
tear
open
the
fine
silk
of
the
cocoons
to
discover
the
inhabitant
most
of
them
contain
the
mason
in
the
perfect
state
others
give
me
the
larva
of
the
anthrax
others
very
numerous
these
give
me
the
larva
of
the
leucopsis
and
this
last
is
alone
always
alone
invariably
alone
the
whole
thing
is
utterly
incomprehensible
when
one
knows
as
i
know
how
many
times
the
probe
entered
those
cells
my
perplexity
only
increases
when
on
the
return
of
summer
i
witness
for
the
second
time
the
leucopsis
repeated
operations
on
the
same
cells
and
for
the
second
time
find
a
single
larva
in
the
compartments
which
have
been
bored
several
times
over
shall
i
then
be
forced
to
accept
that
the
auger
is
able
to
recognize
the
cells
already
containing
an
egg
and
that
it
thenceforth
refrains
from
laying
there
must
i
admit
an
extraordinary
sense
of
touch
in
that
bit
of
or
even
better
a
sort
of
divination
which
declares
where
the
egg
lies
without
having
to
touch
it
but
i
am
raving
there
is
certainly
something
that
escapes
me
and
the
obscurity
of
the
problem
is
simply
due
to
my
incomplete
information
o
patience
supreme
virtue
of
the
observer
come
to
my
aid
once
more
i
must
begin
all
over
again
for
the
third
time
until
now
my
investigations
have
been
made
some
time
after
the
laying
at
a
period
when
the
larva
is
at
least
fairly
developed
who
knows
something
perhaps
happens
at
the
very
commencement
of
infancy
that
may
mislead
me
afterwards
i
must
apply
to
the
egg
itself
if
i
would
learn
the
secret
which
the
grub
will
not
reveal
i
therefore
resume
my
observations
in
the
first
fortnight
of
july
when
the
leucopses
are
beginning
to
visit
busily
both
nests
the
pebbles
in
the
supply
me
with
plenty
of
buildings
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
walls
the
byres
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
fields
give
me
under
their
dilapidated
roofs
in
fragments
broken
off
with
the
chisel
the
edifices
of
the
chalicodoma
of
the
sheds
i
am
anxious
not
to
complete
the
destruction
of
my
home
hives
already
so
sorely
tried
by
my
experiments
they
have
taught
me
much
and
can
teach
me
more
alien
colonies
picked
up
more
or
less
everywhere
provide
me
with
my
booty
with
my
lens
in
one
hand
and
my
forceps
in
the
other
i
go
through
my
collection
on
the
same
day
with
the
prudence
and
care
which
only
the
permits
the
results
at
first
fall
far
short
of
my
expectations
i
see
nothing
that
i
have
not
seen
before
i
make
fresh
expeditions
after
a
few
days
interval
i
bring
back
fresh
loads
of
lumps
of
mortar
until
at
last
fortune
smiles
upon
me
reason
was
not
at
fault
each
thrust
means
the
laying
of
an
egg
when
the
probe
reaches
the
cell
here
is
a
cocoon
of
the
of
the
pebbles
with
an
egg
side
by
side
with
the
but
what
a
curious
egg
never
have
my
eyes
beheld
the
like
and
then
is
it
really
the
egg
of
the
leucopsis
great
was
my
apprehension
but
i
breathed
again
when
i
found
a
couple
of
weeks
later
that
the
egg
had
become
the
larva
with
which
i
was
familiar
those
cocoons
with
a
single
egg
are
as
numerous
as
i
can
wish
they
exceed
my
wishes
my
little
glass
receptacles
are
too
few
to
hold
them
and
here
are
others
more
precious
ones
still
with
manifold
layings
i
find
plenty
with
two
eggs
i
find
some
with
three
or
four
the
offer
me
as
many
as
five
and
to
crown
my
delight
the
joy
of
the
seeker
to
whom
success
comes
at
the
last
moment
when
he
is
on
the
verge
of
despair
here
again
duly
furnished
with
an
egg
is
a
sterile
cocoon
that
is
to
say
one
containing
only
a
shrivelled
and
decaying
larva
all
my
suspicions
are
confirmed
down
to
the
most
inconsequent
the
egg
housed
with
a
mass
of
putrefaction
the
nests
of
the
of
the
walls
are
the
more
regular
in
structure
and
are
easier
to
examine
because
their
base
is
wide
open
once
it
is
separated
from
the
supporting
pebble
and
it
was
these
which
supplied
me
with
by
far
the
greater
part
of
my
information
those
of
the
of
the
sheds
have
to
be
chipped
away
with
a
hammer
before
one
can
inspect
their
cells
which
are
heaped
up
anyhow
and
they
do
not
lend
themselves
anything
like
so
well
to
delicate
investigations
as
they
suffer
both
from
the
shock
and
the
and
now
the
thing
is
done
it
remains
certain
that
the
leucopsis
laying
is
exposed
to
very
exceptional
dangers
she
can
entrust
the
egg
to
sterile
cells
without
provisions
fit
to
use
she
can
establish
several
in
the
same
cell
though
this
cell
contains
nourishment
for
one
only
whether
they
proceed
from
a
single
individual
returning
several
times
by
inadvertence
to
the
same
place
or
are
the
work
of
different
individuals
unaware
of
the
previous
borings
those
multiple
layings
are
very
frequent
almost
as
much
so
as
the
normal
layings
the
largest
which
i
have
noticed
consisted
of
five
eggs
but
we
have
no
authority
for
looking
upon
this
number
as
an
outside
limit
who
could
say
when
the
perforators
are
numerous
to
what
lengths
this
accumulation
can
go
i
will
set
forth
on
some
future
occasion
how
the
ration
of
one
egg
remains
in
reality
the
ration
of
one
egg
despite
the
multiplicity
of
banqueters
i
will
end
by
describing
the
egg
which
is
a
white
opaque
object
shaped
like
a
oval
one
of
the
ends
is
lengthened
out
into
a
neck
or
pedicle
which
is
as
long
as
the
egg
proper
this
neck
is
somewhat
wrinkled
sinuous
and
as
a
rule
considerably
curved
the
whole
thing
is
not
at
all
unlike
certain
gourds
with
an
elongated
paunch
and
a
neck
the
total
length
pedicle
and
all
is
about
millimetres
about
of
an
translator
note
it
is
needless
to
say
after
recognizing
the
grub
manner
of
feeding
that
this
egg
is
not
laid
inside
the
fostering
larva
yet
before
i
knew
the
habits
of
the
leucopsis
i
would
readily
have
believed
that
every
hymenopteron
armed
with
a
long
probe
inserts
her
eggs
into
the
sides
as
the
do
to
the
caterpillars
i
mention
this
for
the
benefit
of
any
who
may
be
under
the
same
erroneous
impression
the
leucopsis
egg
is
not
even
laid
upon
the
larva
it
is
hung
by
its
bent
pedicle
to
the
fibrous
wall
of
the
cocoon
when
i
go
to
work
very
delicately
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
arrangement
in
knocking
the
nest
off
its
support
and
then
extract
and
open
the
cocoon
i
see
the
egg
swinging
from
the
silken
vault
but
it
takes
very
little
to
make
it
fall
and
so
most
often
even
though
it
be
merely
the
effect
of
the
shock
sustained
when
the
nest
is
removed
from
its
pebble
i
find
the
egg
detached
from
its
and
lying
beside
the
larva
to
which
it
never
adheres
in
any
circumstances
the
leucopsis
probe
does
not
penetrate
beyond
the
cocoon
traversed
and
the
egg
remains
fastened
to
the
ceiling
in
the
crook
of
some
silky
thread
by
means
of
its
hooked
pedicle
