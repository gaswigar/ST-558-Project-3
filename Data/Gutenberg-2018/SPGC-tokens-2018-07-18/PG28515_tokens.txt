in
the
plains
around

cocks
crowed
daoud
ibn
abdallah
pushed
himself
slowly
to
his
feet
after
days
and
nights
of
walking
his
legs
ached
abominably
tired
as
he
was
he
looked
around
carefully
studying
the
other
travelers
who
rested
near
him
on
the
road
peering
at
the
city
wall
a
hundred
paces
away
with
its
shut
gate
of
oak
in
his
stomach
he
felt
the
hollow
ball
of
dread
that
had
not
left
him
since
he
landed
in
italy
am
alone
in
the
land
of
the
dawn
gave
a
pink
tint
to
the
pale
yellow
stones
of
the
wall
about
twice
the
height
of
a
man
above
it
in
the
distance
covering
the
summit
of
the
central
hill
rose
the
citadel
of
lucera
surrounded
by
its
own
huge
wall
set
with
more
than
a
dozen
towers
daoud
feet
throbbed
in
his
boots
for
three
days
he
had
walked
along
the
carter
track
from
the
port
of
manfredonia
on
the
adriatic
coast
into
the
hills
around
lucera
yesterday
at
daybreak
he
had
been
able
to
see
from
a
great
distance
the
outline
of
the
fortress
emerging
from
the
center
of
a
rolling
plain
it
had
taken
him
another
day
and
a
night
to
reach
its
gate
around
daoud
now
were
dozens
of
people
who
had
gathered
at
the
gate
during
the
night
mostly
merchants
with
packs
on
their
backs
a
few
farmers
hitched
to
carts
loaded
with
melons
peaches
and
oranges
had
dragged
their
burden
over
the
plain
the
more
prosperous
had
donkeys
to
pull
the
wagons
one
man
with
a
long
stick
drove
six
small
sheep
and
a
cart
near
daoud
was
piled
high
with
wooden
cages
full
of
squawking
chickens
walking
in
his
direction
was
a
tiny
dwarf
of
a
man
who
appeared
permanently
doubled
over
as
if
his
back
had
been
broken
it
seemed
to
daoud
that
if
the
man
were
not
holding
his
arms
out
from
his
sides
for
balance
his
knuckles
would
almost
have
brushed
the
ground
his
little
cart
was
piled
with
broken
tree
limbs
firewood
to
sell
in
the
city
the
dwarf
lifted
his
head
and
grinned
at
daoud
through
a
bushy
black
mustache
daoud
smiled
back
thinking
be
kind
to
you
my
from
within
the
city
issued
a
familiar
cry
in
arabic
that
tore
at
daoud
heart
come
to
prayer
come
to
security
god
is
most
great
it
was
the
adhan
the
cry
of
the
muezzins
in
the
minarets
of
mosques
for
though
he
was
in
a
christian
land
lucera
was
a
city
mostly
populated
by
muslims
daoud
wanted
to
fall
to
his
knees
but
he
was
pretending
to
be
a
christian
and
could
only
stand
and
ignore
the
call
to
prayer
as
the
christians
around
him
did
he
said
the
words
of
the
salat
the
required
prayer
in
his
mind
the
people
near
daoud
spoke
to
one
another
sleepily
softly
in
the
tongue
of
southern
italy
someone
laughed
someone
sang
a
snatch
of
song
when
the
muslim
prayer
ended
they
expectantly
looked
up
at
the
town
wall
daoud
saw
two
soldiers
standing
in
the
tower
to
the
left
of
the
gate
they
were
accoutred
in
the
muslim
manner
with
turbans
wrapped
around
their
helmets
and
scimitars
at
their
belts
one
lifted
a
long
brass
trumpet
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
series
of
notes
that
sent
shivers
along
daoud
spine
with
a
few
changes
it
could
have
been
the
call
that
had
awakened
him
every
morning
in
the
mameluke
barracks
on
raudha
island
in
the
nile
using
ropes
the
other
soldier
hoisted
onto
a
tall
pole
a
yellow
banner
bearing
a
black
bird
with
spread
wings
and
claws
and
two
heads
facing
in
opposite
directions
the
eagle
of
king
family
the
hohenstaufen
with
a
great
squealing
of
cables
and
squeaking
of
hinges
the
tall
wooden
door
swung
wide
daoud
reached
down
and
picked
up
the
leather
pack
that
had
lain
between
his
feet
leaning
forward
he
pushed
his
arms
through
the
shoulder
straps
he
wore
draped
over
his
pack
a
long
countryman
cloak
of
cheap
brown
wool
his
tunic
and
hose
were
of
lightweight
undyed
cotton
only
his
high
boots
were
expensive
he
needed
good
ones
for
the
long
walk
from
the
coast
to
lucera
a
sword
swung
at
his
belt
short
and
unadorned
the
sort
any
man
of
small
means
might
wear
he
had
chosen
it
in
el
kahira
out
of
a
stack
of
swords
taken
from
christian
during
the
last
crusade
he
drew
the
hood
of
his
cloak
over
his
head
later
his
blond
hair
and
gray
eyes
would
guarantee
that
no
one
would
suspect
what
he
was
but
here
in
southern
italy
where
most
ordinary
people
were
dark
complexioned
his
appearance
might
draw
unwanted
attention
even
though
the
sun
had
just
risen
he
felt
the
heat
on
his
back
but
it
was
not
the
dry
heat
of
egypt
that
he
had
known
most
of
his
life
a
heaviness
in
the
air
called
forth
a
dampness
from
within
his
flesh
his
tunic
clung
to
him
a
christian
asks
me
what
month
this
is
i
must
remember
to
say
he
brushed
the
dust
from
his
clothing
and
fell
into
line
behind
the
bent
man
with
his
cart
of
firewood
once
inside
lucera
he
would
find
his
way
to
the
inn
of
and
tonight
the
chancellor
aziz
would
come
to
him
from
king
manfred
the
line
shuffled
forward
three
guards
were
standing
in
the
shadows
just
inside
the
gateway
they
were
big
dark
men
wearing
long
green
capes
over
red
tunics
red
turbans
were
wrapped
around
their
helmets
curving
swords
hung
from
their
belts
a
boy
in
a
red
tunic
and
turban
held
a
sheaf
of
lightweight
spears
their
thick
beards
reminded
daoud
how
much
he
missed
his
own
beard
shaved
off
in
preparation
for
this
mission
daoud
felt
a
sudden
warmth
at
the
familiar
sight
of
warriors
of
islam
the
feeling
was
nonsense
he
told
himself
these
were
not
his
people
but
the
saracens
of
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
their
arab
ancestors
had
once
ruled
southern
italy
but
the
christians
had
conquered
them
over
a
century
before
no
these
muslim
warriors
were
not
daoud
people
in
truth
on
this
whole
earth
there
were
no
people
daoud
ibn
abdallah
could
truly
call
his
own
once
he
had
been
david
langmuir
living
with
his
crusader
father
and
mother
in
a
castle
near
ascalon
by
the
plain
of
gaza
an
english
ancestor
had
been
one
of
the
first
crusaders
in
the
holy
land
just
after
david
ninth
birthday
geoffrey
langmuir
his
father
had
ridden
out
to
war
in
gleaming
mail
with
a
cross
of
red
silk
sewn
on
his
white
surcoat
david
never
saw
him
again
some
weeks
later
the
saracens
appeared
before
the
castle
and
there
were
days
of
thirst
and
hunger
and
constant
fear
he
remembered
the
thunderous
pounding
at
the
walls
and
the
dark
men
in
their
yellow
robes
and
green
turbans
their
swords
coated
with
blood
he
remembered
his
mother
lady
evelyn
in
her
blue
dress
running
up
the
spiral
stairs
of
a
tower
he
heard
her
distant
scream
when
the
saracens
dragged
him
out
of
the
castle
with
men
being
cut
down
by
swords
all
around
him
and
women
thrown
to
the
ground
by
laughing
turks
who
fell
upon
them
he
saw
at
the
base
of
the
tower
a
bundle
of
blue
linen
splashed
with
red
that
must
have
been
his
mother
on
their
leisurely
journey
back
to
the
nile
the
turks
forced
him
to
lie
on
his
belly
and
they
used
him
as
men
use
women
he
would
never
forget
the
tip
of
a
curving
dagger
touched
to
his
eyeball
as
a
bashi
with
a
flowing
black
beard
demanded
that
daoud
use
his
mouth
to
give
him
pleasure
whenever
daoud
remembered
that
time
his
insides
knotted
and
his
face
burned
with
shame
one
day
he
stood
naked
on
a
platform
in
el
kahira
capital
of
the
sultans
the
city
the
christians
called
cairo
a
fat
laughing
slave
dealer
who
had
raped
him
till
he
bled
the
night
before
offered
him
for
sale
a
tall
man
with
one
eye
a
glittering
blue
and
the
other
a
blank
white
a
scimitar
in
a
jeweled
scabbard
thrust
through
the
embroidered
sash
around
his
waist
came
forward
a
silence
fell
over
the
crowd
of
slave
buyers
followed
by
whispers
the
warrior
paid
the
price
asked
in
gold
dinars
and
without
haggling
and
when
the
slaver
fondled
david
loins
one
last
time
as
he
covered
him
with
a
ragged
tunic
the
warrior
seized
the
slaver
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
forcing
him
to
his
knees
and
squeezed
till
he
collapsed
unconscious
in
the
dust
of
the
marketplace
david
was
almost
mad
with
terror
as
the
warrior
took
him
to
his
mansion
beside
a
lake
in
the
center
of
el
kahira
but
the
tall
man
spoke
kindly
to
him
and
treated
him
decently
amazingly
he
could
speak
french
david
language
though
with
a
strange
and
heavy
accent
he
told
david
that
he
was
called
baibars
baibars
the
crossbowman
he
was
an
emir
of
the
bhari
mamelukes
which
meant
he
said
slaves
of
the
river
but
though
the
mamelukes
were
slaves
they
were
also
great
and
powerful
warriors
baibars
gave
david
a
new
name
daoud
and
told
him
that
he
had
selected
him
to
be
a
mameluke
he
explained
in
a
firm
but
kindly
way
that
daoud
did
have
a
choice
but
that
the
alternative
was
a
life
of
unrelieved
wretchedness
as
a
ghulman
a
menial
slave
as
a
mameluke
daoud
would
be
set
free
when
his
training
was
complete
and
he
could
win
riches
and
glory
and
be
a
warrior
for
god
and
his
emir
i
have
long
watched
for
such
a
one
as
you
baibars
said
who
could
look
like
a
christian
but
have
the
mind
and
heart
of
a
mameluke
one
like
you
could
be
a
great
weapon
against
the
enemies
of
the
faith
your
faith
is
not
my
david
who
was
to
be
called
daoud
thought
not
daring
to
speak
your
enemies
are
not
my
his
longing
to
please
this
man
the
first
muslim
to
treat
him
with
respect
struggled
as
the
years
passed
with
his
memories
of
a
christian
childhood
daoud
underwent
the
training
of
a
mameluke
and
baibars
watched
him
closely
daoud
accepted
islam
and
took
the
common
surname
of
a
convert
ibn
abdallah
he
took
naturally
to
the
life
of
a
warrior
and
grew
in
strength
and
skill
year
by
year
baibars
too
became
more
powerful
at
last
he
made
himself
sultan
of
el
kahira
ruler
of
an
empire
that
stretched
from
north
africa
to
syria
daoud
hand
had
wielded
the
flame
dagger
of
the
hashishiyya
that
ended
the
previous
sultan
life
now
having
raised
daoud
trained
him
as
a
mameluke
and
educated
him
in
statecraft
having
sent
him
to
learn
wisdom
from
the
sufi
and
terror
from
the
hashishiyya
having
given
him
a
new
name
and
a
new
faith
baibars
had
sent
daoud
into
the
christian
country
called
italy
the
stones
of
the
gateway
seemed
to
be
marble
unusual
for
a
fortification
daoud
noticed
large
iron
rings
set
at
intervals
under
the
arch
his
feet
crunched
on
fresh
straw
the
space
under
the
arch
was
about
ten
paces
from
outer
portal
to
inner
on
one
side
a
official
sat
at
a
table
the
man
glanced
up
at
daoud
looked
down
at
a
ledger
in
which
he
was
writing
then
raised
his
eyes
again
for
a
longer
look
this
time
the
brown
eyes
met
daoud
the
official
grizzled
hair
formed
a
cap
of
curls
around
his
head
hiding
his
ears
he
had
a
thick
mustache
black
streaked
with
white
his
shirt
of
violet
silk
looked
costly
on
the
straw
beside
him
lay
a
huge
dog
doubtless
bred
for
hunting
with
short
gray
fur
forepaws
stretched
before
it
like
a
sphinx
people
live
with
unclean
daoud
thought
with
distaste
when
the
official
leaned
back
in
his
chair
daoud
saw
the
long
straight
dagger
that
hung
from
his
belt
in
a
scabbard
decorated
with
crossed
bands
of
gold
ribbon
fear
tightened
daoud
throat
this
man
see
through
me
will
he
guess
what
i
am
he
chided
himself
have
gone
among
christians
before
you
have
walked
in
the
midst
of
crusaders
in
the
streets
of
acre
and
antioch
you
have
landed
on
the
island
of
cyprus
you
have
even
gone
as
baibars
emissary
to
the
greeks
of
constantinople
commend
yourself
to
god
and
cast
fear
he
visualized
what
the
hashishiyya
called
the
face
of
steel
within
the
mask
of
clay
what
he
showed
this
official
would
be
his
mask
of
clay
the
look
and
manner
of
the
merchant
he
was
pretending
to
be
beneath
it
unseen
was
his
true
face
a
face
of
steel
forged
over
years
of
bodily
and
spiritual
training
the
mustached
man
allowed
most
of
the
people
in
line
to
pass
into
the
city
after
a
few
quick
questions
daoud
heartbeat
quickened
and
he
tensed
when
his
turn
came
to
pass
come
here
lower
your
hood
the
man
said
walking
slowly
toward
him
daoud
reached
up
and
pushed
back
his
hood
the
official
raised
thick
black
brows
and
beckoned
to
a
guard
if
he
makes
a
move
you
do
not
like
skewer
him
yes
messer
lorenzo
daoud
felt
a
stiffness
in
his
neck
and
a
knot
in
his
belly
king
manfred
chancellor
aziz
had
written
that
daoud
would
be
quietly
admitted
to
the
town
the
heavyset
muslim
soldier
took
a
spear
from
the
boy
standing
near
him
and
leveled
it
at
daoud
his
face
hard
now
then
said
lorenzo
give
us
your
sword
this
overzealous
guard
captain
or
whatever
he
was
was
paying
too
much
attention
to
him
but
to
avoid
more
attention
he
must
readily
cooperate
he
unbuckled
his
sword
belt
and
held
it
out
another
muslim
guard
took
it
and
stepped
beyond
daoud
reach
messer
lorenzo
said
open
your
pack
and
show
me
what
is
in
it
silk
your
signory
daoud
shrugged
the
pack
off
his
shoulders
and
laid
it
on
the
table
he
unlaced
its
flap
and
drew
out
a
folded
length
of
deep
blue
silk
and
then
a
crimson
one
the
shiny
cloth
slid
through
his
long
fingers
i
am
not
a
lord
said
lorenzo
softly
reaching
out
to
caress
the
silk
do
not
insult
me
by
addressing
me
incorrectly
yes
messere
lorenzo
took
the
pack
with
both
hands
and
shook
it
a
shiny
circular
object
a
little
larger
than
a
man
hand
fell
out
lorenzo
picked
it
up
and
frowned
at
it
what
is
this
a
mirror
yes
messere
our
trebizond
mirrors
are
famed
in
byzantium
persia
and
the
holy
land
i
brought
this
as
another
sample
of
what
we
can
offer
it
is
a
good
mirror
lorenzo
agreed
it
shows
me
my
ugly
face
all
too
well
daoud
was
relieved
to
see
lorenzo
had
not
guessed
the
secret
of
the
mirror
that
it
contained
a
deadly
disk
of
hindustan
thrown
properly
the
disk
would
slice
into
an
opponent
like
a
knife
at
lorenzo
command
two
of
the
guards
searched
daoud
briskly
and
efficiently
they
even
made
him
take
off
his
boots
the
fingers
of
one
guard
found
the
chain
around
daoud
neck
and
pulled
on
it
the
locket
daoud
had
hidden
under
his
tunic
came
out
what
is
that
lorenzo
growled
a
chill
ran
over
daoud
body
could
lorenzo
possibly
guess
what
the
locket
was
a
locket
with
a
holy
inscription
in
our
greek
language
messere
open
it
up
with
a
leaden
feeling
in
his
belly
daoud
turned
a
small
screw
in
the
hammered
silver
case
perhaps
he
should
not
have
taken
the
locket
with
him
what
would
lorenzo
see
when
he
looked
at
it
the
cover
fell
open
and
he
glanced
down
at
the
intricate
etched
lines
and
curves
on
the
inner
face
of
the
locket
when
daoud
saw
beginning
to
appear
on
the
crystal
the
face
of
a
woman
with
accents
of
paint
around
her
eyes
he
looked
away
he
leaned
forward
to
give
lorenzo
a
closer
look
at
it
without
taking
it
from
around
his
neck
the
locket
magic
should
work
only
for
the
person
to
whom
it
was
given
daoud
heard
a
low
growl
the
great
hound
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
staring
at
him
with
eyes
as
dark
brown
as
his
master
his
upper
lip
curled
revealing
teeth
like
ivory
scimitars
silence
scipio
lorenzo
said
his
voice
was
soft
but
iron
with
command
the
dog
sat
down
again
but
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
daoud
heart
pounding
he
waited
for
lorenzo
reaction
to
the
locket
the
official
grasped
it
pulling
daoud
head
closer
still
mh
this
is
greek
writing
you
say
it
looks
more
like
arabic
to
me
it
is
very
ancient
messere
and
the
two
alphabets
are
similar
i
can
not
read
it
myself
but
it
has
been
blessed
by
our
christian
priests
lorenzo
let
go
of
the
locket
and
glowered
at
him
what
christian
priests
where
did
you
say
you
are
from
what
is
your
name
with
deep
relief
daoud
stepped
back
from
lorenzo
snapped
the
locket
shut
and
dropped
it
back
inside
the
collar
of
his
tunic
i
am
david
burian
from
trebizond
messere
trebizond
i
never
heard
of
it
said
the
mustached
man
it
is
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
black
sea
you
have
come
such
a
great
distance
with
only
a
few
yards
of
silk
and
a
mirror
in
your
pack
would
you
have
me
believe
this
is
how
you
expect
to
make
your
fortune
daoud
reached
deep
in
his
lungs
for
breath
now
he
would
see
whether
the
christians
would
believe
the
story
he
and
baibars
had
devised
messere
my
city
trebizond
lies
on
the
only
road
to
the
east
not
cut
off
by
the
saracens
a
few
brave
merchants
come
from
the
land
called
cathay
bearing
silk
and
spices
the
samples
i
have
brought
with
me
doubtless
you
can
see
are
of
the
highest
quality
we
can
send
you
many
bales
of
such
silk
overland
from
trebizond
to
constantinople
then
by
ship
to
your
port
of
manfredonia
i
am
here
to
arrange
this
trade
arrange
it
with
whom
daoud
hesitated
he
had
come
to
lucera
to
meet
with
king
manfred
if
through
some
mistake
he
should
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
he
would
try
to
get
word
to
the
king
that
he
was
there
your
local
merchants
your
royal
officials
he
said
even
your
king
manfred
if
he
wishes
to
talk
to
me
so
a
dusty
peddler
comes
to
our
city
gate
and
wants
to
speak
with
the
king
he
turned
to
the
guard
with
the
spear
take
him
to
the
castello
daoud
molded
the
face
of
clay
into
an
expression
of
naive
wonderment
the
castello
where
king
manfred
is
lorenzo
grinned
without
mirth
where
king
manfred
is
my
man
where
we
hang
the
people
sent
by
the
pope
to
murder
king
manfred
lorenzo
eyes
were
hard
as
chips
of
obsidian
and
when
he
said
the
word
daoud
could
feel
the
rough
rope
tightening
around
his
neck
but
he
was
more
angry
now
than
frightened
his
jaw
muscles
clenched
why
had
aziz
not
made
sure
there
would
be
no
mistake
like
this
why
are
you
doing
this
to
me
messer
lorenzo
i
mean
no
harm
and
i
intend
to
see
to
it
that
you
no
harm
in
this
place
messere
of
trebizond
lorenzo
shot
back
he
waved
to
the
guard
to
the
guardroom
ahmad
a
thousand
afrits
hound
this
infidel
to
his
thought
daoud
angrily
and
what
will
you
do
with
me
messer
lorenzo
i
will
examine
you
further
at
my
leisure
after
i
have
passed
all
these
good
people
into
the
city
one
arm
made
a
flowing
gesture
toward
the
waiting
throng
daoud
noticed
that
the
tiny
firewood
seller
who
had
already
passed
by
the
guards
had
paused
at
the
inner
portal
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
touched
forehead
shoulders
and
chest
in
that
sign
christians
made
to
recall
the
cross
of
jesus
their
messiah
i
believe
he
is
praying
for
me
that
is
kindly
ahmad
the
guard
pointed
his
spear
at
daoud
and
jerked
his
head
daoud
stood
his
ground
what
of
my
silk
if
you
keep
it
i
will
truly
have
no
honest
business
in
lucera
lorenzo
smiled
he
stuffed
the
lengths
of
silk
and
the
mirror
back
into
the
pack
and
held
it
out
to
daoud
there
is
not
enough
here
to
be
worth
stealing
take
it
then
and
my
sword
lorenzo
laughed
gruffly
forget
your
sword
take
him
away
ahmad
they
had
missed
the
precious
object
hidden
in
a
pouch
tied
in
his
groin
and
they
missed
the
scorpion
the
miniature
crossbow
devised
by
the
hashishiyya
its
parts
concealed
in
the
hem
of
his
cloak
nor
did
they
have
any
idea
that
the
tie
that
held
his
cloak
at
the
neck
could
be
pulled
loose
to
become
a
long
strangling
cord
flexible
as
silk
and
hard
as
steel
daoud
pulled
his
hood
back
over
his
head
shrugged
into
the
pack
under
his
cloak
and
began
walking
every
step
he
took
sent
a
jolt
of
anger
through
his
body
he
would
like
to
use
his
strangling
cord
on
the
man
responsible
for
this
blunder
the
news
might
well
travel
northward
that
a
blond
merchant
had
been
arrested
trying
to
enter
lucera
and
if
that
man
should
later
appear
at
the
court
of
the
pope
there
might
be
those
who
would
remember
hearing
of
him
and
wonder
why
he
had
gone
first
to
the
pope
enemy
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
his
first
feelings
of
anger
became
a
cold
turmoil
in
his
belly
as
he
thought
what
could
happen
if
his
mission
failed
el
kahira
leveled
its
people
slaughtered
islam
crushed
beneath
the
feet
of
barbarian
conquerors
he
must
not
let
that
happen
the
narrow
street
he
walked
on
was
lined
with
circular
houses
their
brick
walls
a
warm
yellow
color
the
conical
roofs
were
covered
with
thin
slates
a
muslim
sword
maker
looked
up
from
his
forge
to
stare
at
daoud
and
his
guard
as
they
passed
veiled
women
with
red
pottery
jars
on
their
heads
stopped
and
looked
boldly
into
his
eyes
daoud
lifted
his
gaze
to
the
octagonal
central
tower
of
the
citadel
bright
flags
flying
from
its
battlements
instead
of
being
squared
off
the
battlements
were
topped
by
forked
points
like
the
tails
of
swallows
proclaiming
allegiance
to
the
ghibellini
partisans
of
the
hohenstaufen
family
enemies
of
the
pope
closer
to
the
citadel
noises
of
men
and
animals
came
at
daoud
from
all
directions
he
saw
many
buildings
all
connected
with
one
another
their
small
windows
protected
by
iron
grillwork
to
his
right
in
a
large
grassy
open
field
a
hundred
or
more
muslim
guards
in
red
and
green
were
swinging
their
scimitars
as
an
officer
on
a
stone
platform
called
out
the
count
in
arabic
daoud
and
his
guard
passed
by
a
second
yard
where
still
more
muslim
soldiers
were
grooming
their
slender
arab
horses
a
pungent
smell
of
many
beasts
and
fowl
pent
up
close
hung
in
the
warm
damp
air
another
row
of
buildings
echoed
with
the
shrieks
of
birds
falconers
in
tunics
walked
up
and
down
holding
wicker
cages
as
he
peered
into
a
doorway
daoud
saw
the
golden
eyes
of
birds
of
prey
gleaming
at
him
out
of
the
shadows
the
sun
was
high
by
the
time
they
came
to
the
gateway
of
the
castello
so
far
they
have
taken
me
where
i
wanted
to
daoud
thought
grimly
the
entry
hall
of
the
castello
was
a
large
vaulted
room
as
daoud
had
expected
he
had
studied
the
citadel
of
lucera
before
leaving
egypt
as
he
had
studied
many
other
strongholds
in
italy
memorizing
building
plans
and
talking
at
length
with
agents
of
the
sultan
who
had
been
there
a
strange
almost
dizzying
sensation
came
over
daoud
he
recognized
the
feeling
having
had
it
several
times
before
when
in
disguise
he
entered
christian
fortresses
as
he
gazed
around
the
shadowy
stone
hall
its
gloom
relieved
by
shafts
of
light
streaming
in
through
high
narrow
windows
he
seemed
to
be
seeing
everything
through
two
pairs
of
eyes
one
pair
belonged
to
a
mameluke
warrior
daoud
ibn
abdallah
scouting
an
enemy
stronghold
the
other
eyes
were
those
of
a
boy
named
david
langmuir
to
whom
a
christian
castle
had
been
home
and
as
always
on
sensing
that
inner
division
daoud
felt
a
crushing
sadness
ahmad
took
daoud
through
a
series
of
small
rooms
in
the
base
of
the
castle
he
spoke
briefly
to
an
officer
seated
at
a
table
dressed
like
himself
in
red
turban
and
green
tunic
he
gestured
to
a
door
reinforced
with
strips
of
iron
in
there
messer
david
every
muscle
in
daoud
body
screamed
out
in
protest
as
part
of
his
initiation
into
the
hashishiyya
he
had
been
locked
in
a
tiny
black
chamber
in
the
great
pyramid
for
days
and
except
for
the
deaths
of
his
mother
and
father
it
was
the
worst
memory
of
his
life
now
he
ached
to
strike
down
ahmad
and
the
other
muslim
soldier
and
flee
instead
he
said
quietly
how
long
will
i
have
to
wait
ahmad
shrugged
god
alone
knows
ahmad
southern
italian
dialect
was
as
heavily
accented
as
daoud
own
surprised
he
would
be
if
i
were
to
address
him
in
who
is
this
man
who
orders
me
imprisoned
daoud
demanded
ahmad
and
the
other
guard
shrugged
at
the
question
he
is
messer
lorenzo
celino
of
sicily
he
serves
king
manfred
what
does
he
do
for
king
manfred
whatever
the
king
tells
him
to
ahmad
smiled
at
daoud
and
gestured
again
at
the
ironbound
door
thank
you
for
making
the
work
of
guarding
you
easy
may
god
be
kind
to
you
daoud
bowed
in
thanks
remembering
the
proper
christian
farewell
he
said
addio
the
other
soldier
unlocked
the
door
with
a
large
iron
key
and
daoud
walked
reluctantly
into
a
shadowy
room
the
door
slammed
shut
behind
him
and
again
he
went
rigid
with
his
hatred
of
confinement
the
walls
had
recently
been
whitewashed
but
the
little
room
stank
abominably
the
odor
daoud
saw
came
from
a
privy
hole
in
one
corner
where
large
black
flies
circled
in
a
humming
swarm
came
in
through
a
window
covered
with
a
black
iron
grill
whose
openings
were
barely
wide
enough
to
push
a
finger
through
noticing
what
appeared
to
be
a
bundle
of
bedding
against
a
wall
daoud
approached
it
and
squatted
down
for
a
closer
look
he
prodded
it
feeling
straw
under
a
stained
cotton
sheet
at
his
probing
black
dots
almost
too
small
to
see
began
moving
about
rapidly
over
the
sheet
daoud
crossed
the
room
unslung
his
pack
from
his
back
and
dropped
it
to
the
floor
he
sat
down
on
the
flagstones
as
far
from
the
bedding
and
the
privy
opening
as
he
could
get
his
back
against
the
wall
his
knees
drawn
up
like
a
bedouin
in
his
tent
am
daoud
thought
and
terror
and
rage
rose
up
in
him
like
two
djinns
released
from
their
jars
threatening
to
overwhelm
him
he
sat
perfectly
still
to
bring
himself
under
control
he
began
the
contemplative
exercise
his
sufi
teacher
sheikh
saadi
called
the
presence
of
god
god
is
everywhere
and
most
of
all
in
man
heart
saadi
had
said
his
old
eyes
twinkling
he
can
not
be
seen
or
heard
or
touched
or
smelled
or
tasted
therefore
make
your
mind
as
empty
as
the
great
desert
and
you
may
converse
with
god
whose
name
be
praised
daoud
touched
the
farewell
present
saadi
had
given
him
when
he
left
el
kahira
to
begin
the
journey
to
italy
it
was
a
leather
case
tied
around
his
neck
and
it
contained
a
piece
of
paper
called
a
tawidh
an
invocation
whose
words
were
represented
by
arabic
numerals
like
the
locket
it
would
arouse
curiosity
if
someone
searching
him
found
it
but
it
could
be
simply
explained
as
one
of
those
curious
objects
a
traveler
from
distant
places
might
have
about
his
person
and
like
the
locket
it
was
simply
too
precious
to
be
worn
saadi
said
the
tawidh
would
help
wounds
heal
faster
daoud
refused
to
let
himself
think
about
wounds
he
tried
to
make
his
mind
a
blank
and
in
the
effort
he
forgot
for
a
time
where
he
was
ii
messer
lorenzo
celino
of
sicily
strode
into
the
cell
he
held
in
his
hands
a
large
round
slice
of
bread
heaped
with
steaming
slivers
of
meat
that
gave
off
an
unfamiliar
but
succulent
smell
daoud
slowly
climbed
to
his
feet
the
hound
scipio
trailing
celino
watched
him
standing
in
the
doorway
as
if
unwilling
to
enter
the
chamber
daoud
measured
celino
the
top
of
the
sicilian
head
would
come
to
daoud
chin
but
the
shoulders
under
his
violet
tunic
were
broad
and
straight
and
he
moved
with
menacing
grace
daoud
judged
that
though
celino
must
be
close
to
fifty
he
would
be
quick
and
deadly
with
hands
and
feet
and
a
good
swordsman
as
well
god
beard
man
i
did
mean
to
keep
you
sitting
in
this
room
all
day
without
food
or
drink
celino
said
the
damned
farmers
and
traders
kept
coming
and
coming
but
you
can
not
eat
in
this
stinking
place
come
out
daoud
emerged
into
the
next
room
and
lorenzo
motioned
him
to
sit
at
the
guards
table
even
though
daoud
felt
deep
relief
at
being
out
of
the
cell
he
sensed
he
was
in
greater
danger
than
before
his
mouth
went
dry
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
turned
cold
as
his
eyes
scanned
the
room
for
weapons
or
an
escape
route
lorenzo
set
the
trencher
and
its
burden
of
meat
down
before
daoud
just
butchered
here
eat
in
good
health
and
here
is
a
beaker
of
our
good
red
wine
of
monte
vultura
daoud
heard
a
false
note
in
present
heartiness
and
liked
it
even
less
than
his
earlier
gruff
suspicion
wine
an
abomination
forbidden
by
the
prophet
as
celino
set
a
pitcher
and
two
cups
down
on
the
table
daoud
recalled
the
nights
he
had
spent
with
sheikh
saadi
learning
to
master
wine
and
other
drugs
prohibits
the
drinking
of
wine
and
the
eating
of
unclean
foods
not
for
his
good
for
nothing
can
harm
him
but
for
our
good
therefore
when
a
man
goes
among
the
infidel
as
a
spy
god
permits
him
to
eat
and
drink
the
forbidden
things
lest
he
be
discovered
and
put
to
death
you
must
learn
to
separate
your
mind
from
your
body
so
that
what
harms
your
body
will
not
affect
your
daoud
raised
the
cup
wondering
if
he
would
have
as
much
power
over
wine
drunk
in
the
land
of
the
infidel
as
he
did
when
he
drank
it
with
his
teacher
he
sipped
the
red
liquid
was
thick
and
bitter
and
burned
his
mouth
but
he
made
himself
smile
sigh
appreciatively
and
sip
again
he
kept
god
at
the
center
of
his
thoughts
celino
was
watching
him
closely
raising
his
cup
in
salute
he
also
drank
good
good
now
eat
fresh
roasted
pork
daoud
fingers
poised
over
the
meat
stopped
short
already
made
ill
by
hunger
by
the
vile
odor
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
confined
and
by
the
wine
that
made
his
stomach
churn
he
felt
himself
on
the
point
of
vomiting
for
nearly
twenty
years
the
prohibition
against
eating
the
flesh
of
pigs
had
been
impressed
upon
him
until
the
very
thought
of
pork
made
him
sick
he
knew
he
should
have
prepared
himself
by
eating
it
before
he
left
el
kahira
but
he
had
never
found
time
for
that
so
now
a
prisoner
of
the
enemy
he
faced
for
the
first
time
the
test
of
pork
celino
was
watching
him
with
a
half
smile
would
not
test
me
with
wine
and
pig
meat
unless
he
suspected
i
am
a
daoud
fingers
grasped
a
slice
of
the
hot
meat
he
tore
it
in
half
using
both
his
clean
right
hand
and
his
unclean
left
as
a
would
he
stuffed
a
slice
of
pork
into
his
mouth
it
had
smelled
good
until
he
found
out
what
it
was
now
it
seemed
slimy
and
tasteless
his
stomach
clenched
but
he
held
himself
rigid
expressionless
he
started
to
chew
and
found
that
his
mouth
was
dry
his
life
might
depend
on
his
giving
a
convincing
imitation
of
pleasure
he
chewed
the
meat
to
fragments
and
as
though
savoring
it
swallowed
the
abomination
crumb
by
crumb
he
realized
he
was
still
holding
the
other
scrap
of
pork
in
his
left
hand
to
give
himself
a
respite
he
tossed
it
to
the
flagstone
floor
before
lorenzo
hound
unclean
to
the
unclean
he
thought
scipio
looked
at
daoud
with
an
almost
human
look
of
surprise
then
bent
to
devour
the
meat
friday
scipio
said
celino
sharply
you
are
forbidden
meat
the
dog
looked
sadly
up
at
celino
licked
its
chops
and
sat
back
on
its
haunches
leaving
the
meat
untouched
in
spite
of
his
predicament
daoud
laughed
you
see
said
celino
even
a
dog
can
learn
to
obey
the
commandments
celino
gestured
to
the
dog
all
right
scipio
the
bishop
of
palermo
gives
you
a
dispensation
the
dog
stood
and
struck
at
the
meat
with
his
long
muzzle
it
vanished
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
gulping
sounds
he
likes
it
better
than
you
do
celino
said
you
do
not
act
very
hungry
for
a
man
who
has
not
eaten
all
day
come
on
man
fill
your
belly
realizing
that
the
pork
would
taste
worse
as
it
cooled
daoud
braced
himself
and
stuffed
piece
after
piece
into
his
mouth
chewing
and
swallowing
as
rapidly
as
he
could
and
said
celino
watching
him
with
narrowed
eyes
a
dog
can
be
trained
to
break
the
commandments
when
permitted
from
time
to
time
daoud
threw
a
scrap
to
scipio
grateful
for
the
hound
help
but
as
he
ate
daoud
noticed
that
the
meat
began
to
taste
better
to
him
and
the
juices
of
his
mouth
began
to
flow
the
familiar
feeling
of
sorrow
came
over
him
and
he
looked
around
at
the
white
walls
and
ceiling
the
wooden
beams
overhead
painted
blue
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
in
their
place
yellow
stone
walls
and
a
vaulted
ceiling
and
remembered
that
he
had
last
tasted
the
flesh
of
pig
at
table
with
his
father
and
mother
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
sleeve
and
sat
back
thank
you
i
feel
better
now
celino
stood
up
took
the
stale
disk
of
bread
and
dropped
it
to
the
floor
scipio
picked
it
up
in
his
mouth
then
have
the
goodness
to
accompany
me
to
the
hall
of
mars
messer
david
he
said
and
turned
shows
me
that
he
is
not
afraid
to
turn
his
daoud
thought
picking
up
his
pack
and
following
celino
the
hall
of
mars
he
remembered
was
an
indoor
exercise
hall
for
manfred
troops
they
climbed
stairs
and
walked
through
rooms
in
which
muslim
soldiers
were
cleaning
and
polishing
helmets
coats
of
mail
and
weapons
in
one
room
men
were
painting
shields
all
the
shields
were
yellow
and
bore
the
black
eagle
of
the
hohenstaufens
daoud
followed
lorenzo
into
a
very
large
bare
room
with
a
floor
of
polished
hardwood
ropes
and
chains
hung
from
the
walls
and
the
beamed
ceiling
tall
windows
cut
high
up
in
smooth
walls
too
high
to
jump
to
let
in
afternoon
sunlight
and
fresh
air
that
did
not
quite
dispel
a
heavy
odor
of
sweat
opposite
the
doorway
through
which
they
passed
was
another
and
larger
entrance
with
double
doors
the
room
was
not
square
the
walls
were
of
differing
lengths
and
set
at
angles
daoud
recalled
the
octagonal
shape
of
castello
lucera
central
tower
he
reviewed
the
plan
of
the
castle
he
had
committed
to
memory
in
el
kahira
he
was
sure
that
behind
the
double
doors
was
the
great
royal
audience
hall
the
wide
doorway
would
allow
troops
assembled
in
the
hall
of
mars
to
march
into
the
audience
chamber
for
a
review
daoud
noticed
a
group
of
muslim
guards
lounging
in
one
corner
at
lorenzo
entrance
they
touched
their
hands
to
their
turbans
in
salute
lorenzo
responded
with
the
same
gesture
scipio
carried
the
trencher
in
his
mouth
to
a
corner
of
the
room
where
he
lay
down
and
began
pushing
the
hard
bread
around
with
his
forepaws
and
working
at
it
with
his
formidable
teeth
making
loud
crunching
noises
celino
led
daoud
to
the
center
of
the
room
he
turned
suddenly
on
daoud
now
spy
you
will
tell
me
exactly
who
you
are
and
exactly
where
you
come
from
he
said
rapidly
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
or
you
will
die
here
and
now
daoud
came
within
a
breath
of
answering
then
realized
lorenzo
had
spoken
in
arabic
relieved
laughter
bubbled
up
toward
his
throat
he
had
not
been
caught
he
choked
it
down
and
assumed
a
puzzled
expression
i
do
not
understand
daoud
said
in
italian
what
tongue
are
you
speaking
messer
lorenzo
liar
said
lorenzo
still
in
arabic
his
eyes
narrowing
i
understand
italian
greek
and
of
course
the
speech
of
scythia
said
daoud
if
you
would
question
me
speak
in
one
of
those
tongues
daoud
sensed
that
the
sicilian
sudden
shifts
of
mood
were
calculated
while
his
mouth
uttered
accusations
celino
eyes
watched
him
with
a
calm
intelligence
that
reminded
daoud
of
an
emir
examining
a
horse
for
hidden
flaws
daoud
saw
at
the
edge
of
his
vision
that
the
guards
who
had
been
lounging
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
were
now
in
motion
he
glanced
quickly
left
and
right
three
men
about
fifty
paces
away
were
coming
at
him
curved
swords
drawn
the
dog
scipio
had
abandoned
the
trencher
and
risen
to
his
feet
and
he
too
was
advancing
on
daoud
fangs
bared
lorenzo
stepped
away
from
daoud
still
pointing
at
him
spegni
kill
tension
crackled
across
daoud
stomach
like
a
lash
three
swords
and
a
dog
that
looked
capable
of
killing
a
man
none
of
the
weapons
he
had
hidden
on
him
would
do
for
this
he
slung
his
pack
toward
the
wall
behind
him
leaving
both
hands
free
he
half
turned
to
keep
lorenzo
in
sight
while
watching
the
advancing
men
the
sicilian
had
a
long
dagger
in
a
scabbard
hung
by
his
right
side
but
he
did
not
draw
it
facing
the
three
swords
daoud
had
not
yet
raised
his
hands
but
his
legs
tensed
he
bent
at
the
knees
shifted
his
weight
to
the
balls
of
his
feet
he
whirled
and
sprang
at
lorenzo
the
sicilian
jumped
backward
and
daoud
could
hear
behind
him
the
pounding
of
booted
feet
on
the
wooden
floor
the
dog
barked
furiously
daoud
grappled
with
lorenzo
the
sicilian
grabbed
his
forearms
trying
to
hold
him
at
a
distance
and
his
strength
was
almost
a
match
for
daoud
but
daoud
twisted
his
arms
free
drove
in
and
caught
neck
in
the
bend
of
his
left
arm
he
swung
him
around
so
that
the
sicilian
body
was
between
himself
and
the
three
attacking
soldiers
while
lorenzo
stumbled
daoud
plucked
the
man
dagger
out
of
its
scabbard
it
had
two
sharp
edges
and
came
to
a
point
scipio
leapt
at
him
but
daoud
shifted
lorenzo
between
himself
and
the
hound
and
scipio
fell
back
his
enraged
barking
was
deafening
like
the
roar
of
a
lion
his
fangs
were
a
row
of
bone
he
danced
right
and
left
seeking
a
way
to
get
past
lorenzo
to
daoud
the
joy
of
battle
the
weapon
in
his
hand
made
daoud
feel
the
power
coursing
through
his
arms
but
that
damned
dog
had
to
be
stopped
his
teeth
were
as
dangerous
to
daoud
as
the
curving
blades
of
the
three
muslim
soldiers
those
fangs
could
rip
through
his
boots
tear
the
muscles
of
his
legs
and
cripple
him
he
would
prefer
death
releasing
lorenzo
neck
daoud
gripped
lorenzo
wrist
and
twisted
hard
and
fast
biting
his
lip
lorenzo
resisted
but
he
had
to
turn
and
bend
or
the
pressure
on
his
arm
would
break
it
daoud
laid
the
edge
of
lorenzo
dagger
against
his
throat
call
off
your
dog
or
i
cut
your
throat
daoud
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
no
one
was
behind
him
by
all
means
cut
my
throat
lorenzo
flung
back
at
him
and
scipio
will
tear
throat
out
if
the
dog
jumps
at
me
i
will
gut
him
the
devil
roast
your
balls
lorenzo
growled
scipio
sit
the
hound
stopped
barking
and
stared
at
lorenzo
down
scipio
lorenzo
said
he
will
not
hurt
me
to
daoud
he
said
if
you
do
hurt
me
you
will
suffer
such
things
that
you
will
beg
us
to
kill
you
scipio
reluctantly
crouched
murder
in
his
brown
eyes
and
a
steady
low
growling
issuing
from
his
throat
the
three
muslim
guards
were
still
moving
forward
far
more
warily
daoud
felt
strong
and
able
now
to
deal
with
these
four
men
but
he
could
almost
feel
the
weight
of
the
overwhelming
trap
he
was
in
the
thick
walls
the
thousands
of
soldiers
it
was
hopeless
he
could
fight
on
only
until
he
died
and
that
was
not
what
he
had
come
here
for
at
all
daoud
stepped
back
toward
the
farther
doorway
pulling
lorenzo
with
him
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
be
sure
no
one
was
behind
him
for
my
part
said
daoud
i
will
hurt
you
till
you
beg
to
put
down
their
swords
i
will
start
by
breaking
your
arm
he
gave
the
twisted
arm
a
vicious
upward
push
till
he
could
almost
feel
the
agony
of
the
tendons
lorenzo
grunted
and
scipio
barked
angrily
most
men
daoud
thought
would
have
screamed
aloud
at
that
no
matter
what
you
do
to
me
it
will
not
help
you
said
lorenzo
three
more
turbaned
muslim
soldiers
joined
those
coming
at
daoud
they
spread
out
in
a
wide
circle
some
of
them
trying
to
slip
around
to
his
rear
stand
where
you
are
or
i
kill
him
daoud
shouted
to
show
he
meant
it
he
pressed
the
knife
edge
hard
against
celino
throat
and
sliced
with
it
just
enough
to
draw
blood
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
the
taste
of
your
own
intestines
lorenzo
said
he
dug
his
boot
heels
into
the
wooden
floor
trying
to
slow
down
effort
to
drag
him
to
the
door
daoud
pushed
up
harder
on
his
arm
to
make
him
move
faster
daoud
felt
no
fear
of
death
and
he
would
not
let
them
take
him
prisoner
to
torture
him
he
would
die
fighting
and
go
straight
to
paradise
but
how
foolish
all
this
was
a
waste
of
his
own
life
and
the
lives
he
would
take
with
him
and
many
of
those
he
would
kill
were
muslims
like
himself
you
must
know
that
you
will
be
the
first
to
die
here
he
said
and
believe
me
i
will
take
many
of
your
men
with
me
i
may
even
manage
to
kill
your
precious
dog
i
did
not
come
here
to
fight
with
king
men
why
are
you
doing
this
celino
who
had
been
struggling
against
daoud
now
relaxed
and
turned
his
head
you
are
too
dangerous
to
live
dangerous
to
whom
to
me
said
a
deep
voice
behind
daoud
iii
daoud
turned
dragging
celino
a
blond
man
stood
hands
on
hips
eyeing
him
with
a
faint
smile
one
of
the
big
doors
leading
into
the
royal
audience
chamber
was
slightly
ajar
daoud
was
angry
at
himself
for
letting
someone
slip
up
behind
him
unnoticed
sire
get
back
lorenzo
shouted
daoud
knew
at
once
who
this
was
the
same
height
as
lorenzo
as
daoud
now
saw
the
man
had
the
very
broad
shoulders
christian
knights
developed
from
wielding
their
huge
swords
daoud
guessed
his
age
at
a
little
over
thirty
his
hair
so
blond
it
was
almost
silver
hung
in
soft
waves
below
his
ears
curling
at
the
ends
his
mustache
was
carefully
trimmed
his
eyelids
crinkled
with
amusement
he
wore
a
tunic
of
silk
under
a
short
cloak
trimmed
with
white
fur
his
hose
and
boots
were
also
shades
of
green
from
a
chain
around
his
neck
hung
a
silver
star
with
a
spherical
ruby
in
its
center
in
every
point
he
fit
the
description
daoud
had
been
given
the
despair
daoud
had
been
feeling
a
moment
before
gave
way
to
a
profound
relief
it
had
seemed
that
everything
stood
in
the
way
of
his
meeting
this
man
and
now
at
last
they
were
sire
daoud
said
in
italian
i
know
who
you
are
and
you
must
know
who
i
am
i
do
indeed
said
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
still
smiling
please
release
messer
lorenzo
daoud
hesitated
only
a
moment
but
if
manfred
allowed
lorenzo
to
hurt
him
now
the
mission
was
a
failure
anyway
tensed
for
attack
he
let
go
of
lorenzo
who
sprang
away
in
an
instant
the
sicilian
had
taken
a
curving
islamic
sword
from
a
soldier
sire
at
least
move
back
from
him
lorenzo
said
you
know
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
quiet
lorenzo
snapped
manfred
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
peddler
from
some
misty
land
beyond
the
black
sea
who
happens
to
be
infernally
nimble
that
is
all
daoud
was
pleased
to
hear
manfred
go
along
with
his
disguise
he
relaxed
a
bit
and
eyed
the
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
a
man
with
a
charm
that
daoud
felt
after
only
a
moment
acquaintance
will
the
peddler
be
so
kind
as
to
return
my
dagger
lorenzo
asked
with
heavy
irony
this
side
of
the
black
sea
it
is
considered
discourteous
to
stand
in
the
king
presence
holding
a
naked
weapon
of
course
said
daoud
holding
the
dagger
by
its
guard
and
handing
it
to
lorenzo
who
in
turn
gave
the
saracen
soldier
back
his
sword
daoud
was
glad
he
had
not
had
to
kill
lorenzo
the
sicilian
like
his
master
manfred
was
clearly
a
man
above
the
common
run
his
behavior
toward
daoud
so
far
had
been
a
series
of
clever
pretenses
indeed
daoud
was
sure
he
had
not
gotten
to
the
bottom
of
lorenzo
yet
i
thank
you
for
entertaining
us
with
this
display
of
your
fighting
skills
messer
david
said
king
manfred
now
let
us
talk
of
the
silk
trade
join
us
lorenzo
manfred
led
the
way
into
the
audience
chamber
beyond
the
hall
of
mars
walking
beside
daoud
celino
snapped
his
fingers
at
scipio
the
big
gray
hound
rose
and
followed
casting
a
hostile
look
at
daoud
did
they
try
to
kill
me
in
the
audience
hall
marble
pillars
supported
a
vaulted
ceiling
pierced
by
circular
glazed
windows
a
dozen
or
more
men
and
women
stood
around
staring
at
daoud
his
glance
quickly
took
in
the
feathered
caps
of
the
men
the
pale
rose
and
violet
gowns
of
the
women
and
the
gilded
nets
that
held
their
hair
he
tried
not
to
stare
at
the
women
whose
faces
were
bare
in
the
manner
of
unbelievers
but
they
were
all
he
noted
beautiful
in
varying
degrees
several
had
striking
blond
hair
and
blue
eyes
though
it
was
his
own
coloring
he
was
not
used
to
seeing
fair
women
and
his
heartbeat
quickened
but
the
gaze
of
a
darker
woman
met
his
her
eyes
seemed
to
burn
her
nose
was
small
the
nostrils
flaring
her
lips
full
and
dark
red
the
face
was
carefully
without
expression
revealing
as
little
as
if
it
were
indeed
covered
with
a
veil
the
dark
woman
black
hair
was
coiled
on
top
of
her
head
in
braids
intertwined
with
ropes
of
pearls
her
scarlet
gown
was
decorated
with
long
strips
of
satin
embroidered
in
floral
designs
over
her
narrow
shoulders
she
wore
a
shawl
of
silk
having
been
to
constantinople
daoud
recognized
her
style
of
dress
as
byzantine
she
made
the
other
women
of
manfred
court
look
like
barbarians
she
held
his
gaze
steadily
he
bowed
his
head
courteously
and
she
responded
with
a
faint
nod
then
he
was
past
her
standing
on
a
dais
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
a
large
chair
of
black
wood
with
painted
panels
to
the
left
of
the
dais
sat
a
small
group
of
men
holding
string
and
wind
instruments
on
the
right
was
a
small
doorway
a
servant
leapt
to
fling
open
the
door
for
manfred
who
strode
briskly
toward
it
tossing
pleasantries
to
his
courtiers
the
door
led
through
a
series
of
rooms
where
clerks
wrote
busily
and
daoud
noticed
with
surprise
that
they
went
right
on
scribbling
as
their
king
walked
through
obviously
manfred
preferred
their
work
to
their
homage
daoud
sensed
that
their
path
was
taking
them
on
a
circuit
of
the
great
structure
they
passed
through
a
small
kitchen
where
bakers
were
preparing
fruit
pastries
manfred
plucked
a
freshly
baked
cherry
tart
from
a
tray
bit
into
it
and
nodded
to
the
bowing
cook
to
his
surprise
daoud
noticed
a
small
figure
in
one
corner
the
little
bent
man
who
had
earlier
looked
on
him
with
pity
the
dwarf
lay
curled
up
on
his
side
with
closed
eyes
on
his
empty
firewood
cart
not
a
bad
occupation
daoud
thought
supplying
firewood
to
the
king
pastry
kitchen
beyond
the
kitchen
the
three
men
entered
another
great
hall
so
brightly
lit
that
daoud
eyes
hurt
for
a
moment
the
afternoon
sun
streamed
through
arched
windows
of
white
glass
set
as
in
the
hall
of
mars
high
in
the
walls
the
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
loaded
with
books
and
compartments
filled
with
scrolls
walkways
at
three
levels
ran
around
the
walls
and
ladders
were
spaced
along
them
men
in
long
gray
tunics
browsed
at
the
shelves
or
sat
at
tables
in
the
center
of
the
room
reading
books
and
scrolls
and
making
notes
on
parchment
a
servant
opened
a
grill
in
the
shortest
wall
of
the
library
and
the
three
men
stepped
out
under
the
sky
into
an
octagonal
space
filled
with
trees
and
plants
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
a
colonnaded
gallery
in
the
center
of
the
garden
a
small
fountain
played
topped
by
a
small
bronze
statue
of
a
naked
woman
straddling
a
dolphin
the
water
spurting
from
the
dolphin
mouth
daoud
was
momentarily
shocked
the
most
powerful
and
corrupt
emir
in
egypt
would
not
dare
to
have
such
a
statue
where
strangers
might
see
it
manfred
beckoned
and
daoud
followed
him
down
a
pebble
path
to
the
basin
of
the
fountain
small
dark
green
fish
flickered
through
the
water
the
king
seated
himself
on
a
marble
bench
and
the
two
men
stood
before
him
at
a
gesture
from
lorenzo
scipio
lay
down
in
the
sun
beside
a
bush
bearing
dozens
of
roses
the
sun
gleamed
on
manfred
pale
hair
what
does
your
sultan
want
of
me
he
asked
i
am
ordered
to
speak
openly
only
to
you
and
your
secretary
aziz
said
daoud
his
glance
shifting
to
lorenzo
ah
you
did
not
know
then
that
aziz
is
the
name
lorenzo
celino
uses
when
he
writes
to
the
sultan
of
cairo
for
me
lorenzo
celino
aziz
daoud
turned
to
celino
and
laughed
with
delighted
surprise
you
write
excellent
arabic
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
you
were
not
one
of
us
lorenzo
accepted
daoud
compliment
with
a
small
bow
one
of
said
manfred
and
what
are
you
then
messere
i
see
before
me
a
strapping
man
blond
enough
to
be
one
of
my
swabian
knights
yet
who
claims
to
come
from
the
sultan
of
cairo
you
are
no
arab
or
turk
indeed
not
sire
said
daoud
i
am
a
mameluke
a
blond
mameluke
manfred
nodded
where
are
you
from
then
russia
or
circassia
without
emotion
daoud
told
the
king
of
his
descent
from
crusaders
and
his
capture
by
the
muslims
what
a
strange
world
this
is
said
manfred
and
when
did
this
happen
to
you
twenty
years
ago
sire
for
most
of
those
years
i
have
served
my
lord
baibars
who
is
now
sultan
of
cairo
and
you
are
a
muslim
of
course
sire
manfred
stood
up
and
came
close
to
him
of
course
you
say
that
so
firmly
do
you
not
remember
the
christian
teachings
of
your
childhood
the
question
made
daoud
angry
soul
is
undivided
king
or
not
how
dare
this
infidel
question
that
god
willed
that
i
find
the
truth
sire
he
said
simply
manfred
shrugged
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
i
have
lived
among
muslims
all
my
life
may
i
know
sire
why
your
secretary
to
whom
my
master
sent
me
in
good
faith
tried
to
kill
me
daoud
asked
manfred
turned
his
back
on
daoud
and
strolled
a
short
distance
down
the
pebble
path
lorenzo
is
neither
my
secretary
nor
does
he
normally
command
my
gate
guards
he
performs
for
me
tasks
that
require
a
man
of
uncommon
courage
loyalty
and
wit
such
as
testing
you
first
by
taking
you
prisoner
then
by
giving
you
pork
and
wine
and
speaking
to
you
in
arabic
finally
by
trying
to
kill
you
but
i
might
have
killed
him
i
did
not
realize
how
much
of
a
risk
i
was
taking
said
lorenzo
we
did
not
think
baibars
could
find
anywhere
in
his
empire
a
man
who
could
go
to
the
papal
court
undetected
we
hoped
to
show
him
his
error
and
send
you
back
but
you
are
quite
a
remarkable
man
david
baibars
his
error
manfred
might
be
a
brilliant
man
but
he
evidently
underestimated
baibars
daoud
sensed
himself
feeling
a
bit
superior
and
warned
himself
not
to
make
the
same
mistake
and
underestimate
manfred
perhaps
now
that
you
have
tested
my
ability
sire
you
might
be
more
inclined
to
help
me
help
you
to
do
what
there
was
a
note
of
irritation
in
voice
your
sultan
baibars
has
asked
me
only
to
help
you
carry
out
a
mission
in
the
papal
states
what
is
your
mission
daoud
said
sire
my
master
chose
not
to
entrust
his
plan
to
writing
but
sent
me
to
tell
it
to
you
instead
i
am
here
for
one
purpose
to
prevent
the
forming
of
an
alliance
between
christians
and
tartars
manfred
looked
surprised
and
stared
intently
at
daoud
tartars
those
barbarians
who
invaded
europe
how
long
ago
lorenzo
lorenzo
frowned
over
twenty
years
sire
daoud
said
fifty
years
ago
they
were
nothing
a
scattering
of
herdsmen
like
the
bedouin
now
they
are
the
most
powerful
people
on
earth
manfred
nodded
yes
i
remember
now
when
they
rode
into
poland
and
hungary
i
was
just
a
boy
everyone
was
in
terror
of
them
their
emperor
sent
letters
to
all
the
monarchs
of
europe
demanding
that
they
surrender
he
contemptuously
offered
them
positions
in
his
court
he
grinned
at
daoud
my
father
showed
me
the
letter
he
was
sending
back
if
tartar
emperor
succeeded
in
conquering
europe
my
father
said
he
would
be
well
qualified
to
serve
as
his
falconer
daoud
inclined
his
head
your
family
love
of
falconry
is
well
known
to
your
admirers
in
the
lands
of
islam
my
lord
the
sultan
considers
you
an
old
friend
and
hopes
that
you
will
see
fit
to
help
him
in
his
time
of
need
manfred
held
out
his
hands
palms
up
if
i
can
now
the
tartars
have
fallen
upon
the
lands
of
islam
daoud
said
they
have
conquered
persia
they
have
a
hundred
thousand
mounted
warriors
in
the
field
and
allies
and
auxiliaries
they
have
leveled
our
holy
city
of
baghdad
destroyed
it
utterly
and
killed
every
man
woman
and
child
who
lived
there
even
the
commander
of
the
faithful
our
caliph
himself
these
are
no
fanciful
tales
sire
i
have
fought
against
the
tartars
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
ashes
of
baghdad
and
the
heaps
of
its
dead
the
scene
of
desolation
arose
in
his
mind
as
it
had
so
many
times
before
the
gray
plain
where
a
city
had
been
the
unbelievable
sight
of
a
landscape
strewn
with
rotting
headless
corpses
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
he
hurried
on
with
what
he
had
to
say
now
their
armies
advance
through
syria
threatening
the
realm
of
my
lord
the
sultan
of
cairo
we
have
had
word
that
hulagu
khan
commander
of
the
tartar
armies
in
persia
has
sent
two
emissaries
to
the
pope
they
are
sailing
across
the
middle
sea
now
from
the
island
of
cyprus
to
venice
hulagu
khan
wants
to
form
an
alliance
with
the
christian
rulers
of
europe
to
attack
us
from
both
directions
at
once
east
and
west
our
whole
people
our
whole
muslim
faith
could
be
utterly
wiped
out
manfred
nodded
grimly
and
all
of
christian
europe
would
rejoice
at
your
destruction
not
i
certainly
but
the
rest
of
them
what
do
you
propose
to
do
about
these
tartar
emissaries
to
the
pope
for
that
i
will
need
your
help
sire
i
too
will
go
to
the
court
i
understand
that
he
resides
at
orvieto
a
small
town
north
of
rome
yes
lorenzo
put
in
and
there
he
will
stay
he
has
not
set
foot
in
rome
since
he
galloped
in
to
be
crowned
at
saint
peter
and
galloped
out
again
he
is
terrified
of
the
roman
mob
as
well
he
should
be
since
most
of
their
leaders
are
in
our
pay
trade
secrets
celino
said
manfred
raising
a
cautioning
finger
so
you
will
go
to
orvieto
and
then
i
will
present
myself
at
the
pope
court
as
i
have
here
as
david
a
merchant
of
trebizond
i
will
take
up
residence
with
friends
who
can
help
me
reach
the
ears
of
men
of
influence
i
will
spread
stories
throughout
orvieto
true
stories
of
the
horrors
the
tartars
have
perpetrated
everywhere
they
have
gone
of
their
determination
to
conquer
the
entire
world
manfred
shook
his
head
what
you
plan
to
do
is
very
dangerous
proven
to
us
that
you
are
a
skilled
and
resourceful
man
but
still
what
if
you
are
discovered
he
shook
his
head
have
you
any
idea
of
how
your
people
are
in
europe
david
if
it
were
known
that
i
helped
a
muslim
spy
to
steal
into
the
court
of
the
pope
all
the
kingdoms
of
christendom
would
turn
against
me
the
pope
need
but
snap
his
fingers
and
i
and
my
little
realm
would
be
swept
away
no
david
you
ask
me
to
risk
too
much
daoud
was
momentarily
surprised
then
angry
he
had
expected
that
manfred
would
cooperate
with
him
if
the
young
king
vacillated
daoud
might
have
journeyed
from
egypt
to
italy
for
nothing
and
then
a
ripple
of
fear
crept
up
his
spine
if
he
failed
to
persuade
manfred
the
tartars
might
destroy
the
world
he
had
come
to
love
and
believe
in
help
me
to
stop
them
i
must
not
go
back
to
el
kahira
a
he
must
choose
his
words
with
care
he
was
dealing
here
with
a
king
and
one
did
not
argue
with
kings
better
to
ask
questions
than
offer
arguments
does
not
the
pope
wish
even
now
to
take
your
throne
from
you
sire
he
said
how
can
matters
between
you
and
him
be
any
worse
manfred
nodded
true
pope
urban
keeps
offering
my
crown
to
this
prince
and
that
claiming
that
i
had
no
right
to
inherit
it
from
my
father
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
have
it
in
the
first
place
manfred
bit
his
lip
and
the
light
pink
of
his
cheeks
reddened
but
only
the
french
are
powerful
enough
to
take
it
from
me
and
king
louis
of
france
is
kindly
disposed
to
me
and
will
not
permit
any
of
his
great
barons
to
make
war
on
me
i
rely
on
louis
continued
goodwill
but
the
man
who
wants
to
join
with
the
tartars
to
annihilate
islam
is
that
same
king
louis
of
france
daoud
said
france
as
you
said
is
the
only
kingdom
with
the
power
to
help
the
pope
dethrone
you
should
the
pope
decide
against
allying
with
the
tartars
king
louis
will
continue
to
prohibit
his
subjects
from
joining
the
pope
war
against
you
help
me
and
you
come
between
king
louis
and
the
pope
intrigue
requires
gold
said
manfred
does
your
master
expect
me
to
pay
for
your
activities
what
i
have
brought
with
me
will
pay
for
all
daoud
replied
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
undid
the
laces
that
held
his
hose
tight
around
his
waist
celino
moved
closer
tense
ready
in
case
daoud
should
reach
for
a
weapon
daoud
slipped
his
fingers
into
the
breeches
he
wore
under
his
hose
and
found
the
bag
tied
to
the
drawstring
what
is
the
man
doing
said
manfred
with
a
wondering
smile
celino
shook
his
head
daoud
pulled
out
a
bag
of
heavy
red
silk
full
and
round
with
what
it
held
he
felt
a
childlike
delight
in
mystifying
the
two
men
pay
me
from
your
royal
treasury
what
this
is
worth
said
daoud
and
i
shall
have
gold
enough
for
all
i
need
to
do
he
pulled
apart
the
mouth
of
the
silk
bag
and
drew
out
of
it
a
globe
of
green
fire
he
held
it
out
to
manfred
celino
gasped
daoud
was
gratified
at
their
wonderment
are
you
not
afraid
i
will
steal
this
from
you
and
dump
you
in
an
unmarked
grave
said
manfred
with
a
bright
grin
the
hohenstaufen
family
have
been
friends
of
the
sultans
of
egypt
since
your
father
day
said
daoud
we
have
learned
to
trust
you
just
listen
to
that
lorenzo
said
manfred
the
saracens
think
better
of
me
than
the
pope
does
besides
daoud
thought
manfred
knew
that
baibars
arm
was
long
manfred
daoud
was
sure
knew
that
baibars
would
not
permit
anyone
even
a
distant
head
of
state
to
betray
him
so
flagrantly
his
eyes
wide
manfred
extended
his
palm
and
daoud
unhesitatingly
placed
the
emerald
in
it
manfred
raised
it
close
to
his
face
peering
through
the
dark
depths
into
its
glowing
heart
the
jewel
irregular
in
shape
but
nearly
spherical
reflected
little
spots
of
pale
green
light
on
his
cheeks
he
shook
his
head
green
the
color
i
love
best
in
all
the
world
the
color
of
hope
he
encircled
it
with
thumb
and
forefinger
look
lorenzo
i
can
not
get
my
fingers
around
it
i
am
amazed
that
your
master
is
willing
to
part
with
such
a
wonder
how
did
he
come
by
it
it
has
been
through
many
hands
sire
said
daoud
it
once
belonged
to
emir
fakr
who
commanded
the
army
of
egypt
when
king
louis
invaded
our
land
to
think
baibars
let
you
take
this
emerald
from
him
and
you
came
all
this
way
from
alexandria
with
it
and
delivered
it
to
me
and
baibars
trusted
you
as
he
trusts
you
sire
daoud
put
in
quickly
are
like
a
falcon
are
you
not
said
manfred
smiling
into
daoud
eyes
released
to
fly
far
afield
for
your
sultan
manfred
strode
to
daoud
suddenly
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
let
it
be
done
as
your
master
wishes
then
the
trader
from
trebizond
will
go
to
orvieto
with
my
help
a
surge
of
joy
sprang
up
within
daoud
and
almost
burst
past
his
lips
he
bowed
his
heart
pounding
be
thanked
manfred
said
we
must
see
about
turning
this
jewel
of
yours
into
gold
coins
or
smaller
jewels
they
would
be
easier
to
carry
than
gold
manfred
looked
lovingly
at
the
emerald
again
then
carefully
dropped
it
into
his
belt
pouch
and
smiled
at
daoud
you
should
not
go
alone
into
the
papal
states
david
you
may
have
studied
europe
from
afar
but
you
do
not
know
italy
firsthand
lorenzo
here
shall
go
with
you
i
trust
lorenzo
to
travel
far
and
secretly
in
my
service
even
as
your
master
trusts
you
celino
sighed
daoud
and
celino
eyed
each
other
daoud
began
searching
for
ways
to
dissuade
manfred
a
short
while
earlier
he
and
celino
had
been
trying
to
kill
each
other
and
celino
would
be
putting
manfred
interests
first
not
those
of
islam
obviously
aware
of
his
hesitation
manfred
took
his
arm
listen
to
me
mameluke
you
will
be
wise
to
accept
every
bit
of
help
that
is
offered
to
you
i
have
powerful
allies
in
northern
italy
in
florence
pisa
siena
and
other
cities
but
you
do
not
know
them
and
they
do
not
know
you
lorenzo
speaks
for
me
he
knows
who
the
key
ghibellini
are
in
the
north
and
they
know
him
do
not
object
to
taking
him
with
you
manfred
would
not
let
him
go
daoud
realized
unless
celino
went
with
him
and
the
argument
that
celino
could
put
him
in
touch
with
the
ghibellini
of
the
north
was
a
strong
one
is
perhaps
twenty
years
older
than
i
but
he
is
and
quick
on
his
feet
and
yes
i
would
rather
not
go
alone
i
could
easily
make
a
mistake
from
ignorance
i
am
better
off
with
a
man
like
this
to
guide
a
tentative
smile
played
under
celino
grizzled
mustache
my
royal
master
is
determined
in
this
what
do
you
say
daoud
bowed
i
accept
with
gratitude
we
shall
travel
this
road
together
whatever
happens
to
the
two
of
you
manfred
said
no
one
must
ever
know
that
i
am
involved
i
guarantee
that
sire
said
celino
manfred
rubbed
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
there
is
one
other
person
i
propose
to
send
with
you
she
can
be
a
great
help
to
you
celino
turned
quickly
to
manfred
i
do
not
advise
it
sire
why
not
said
manfred
she
will
be
perfect
because
she
will
not
want
to
go
there
was
censure
in
celino
dark
stare
and
a
boyish
defiance
in
manfred
answering
look
do
not
question
me
said
manfred
i
have
no
choice
for
her
good
and
for
my
own
she
must
leave
here
and
she
be
useful
to
you
instead
of
replying
celino
only
sighed
again
a
woman
daoud
was
thunderstruck
in
el
kahira
women
left
their
homes
only
to
visit
other
women
he
felt
anxiety
claw
at
his
belly
any
mistake
in
planning
might
wreck
the
mission
and
doom
him
and
celino
to
a
horrible
death
and
to
send
a
woman
to
the
court
of
the
pope
on
such
a
venture
seemed
not
just
a
mistake
but
utter
madness
a
very
beautiful
woman
said
manfred
a
grin
stretching
his
blond
mustache
one
who
has
had
a
lifetime
schooling
in
intrigue
she
is
from
constantinople
and
her
name
is
sophia
which
means
wisdom
in
greek
are
no
more
treacherous
people
on
this
earth
than
the
daoud
thought
they
have
ever
been
enemies
of
argument
surged
up
in
him
but
he
saw
a
hardness
in
manfred
eyes
that
told
him
nothing
he
might
say
would
sway
the
king
he
looked
at
celino
and
saw
in
the
dark
mustached
face
the
same
reluctant
acceptance
he
had
heard
in
the
sigh
whoever
this
sophia
might
be
he
would
have
to
take
her
with
him
iv
sophia
pressed
her
head
back
against
the
pillow
and
screamed
with
pleasure
her
loins
dissolved
into
rippling
liquid
gold
her
fingers
dug
into
the
man
back
and
her
legs
clenched
around
his
hips
trying
to
crush
him
against
her
oh
oh
oh
she
moaned
the
warmth
spread
to
her
toes
her
fingertips
her
scalp
filling
her
with
joy
she
was
so
happy
that
she
wanted
to
cry
as
the
blaze
of
ekstasia
died
down
she
felt
manfred
driving
deep
inside
her
she
felt
his
hardness
his
separateness
as
she
could
not
feel
it
a
moment
ago
when
she
was
at
her
peak
and
they
seemed
to
melt
together
one
being
his
rhythm
was
insistent
inexorable
like
a
heartbeat
his
hands
under
her
back
were
tense
he
was
fighting
for
his
climax
she
delighted
in
the
sight
of
his
massive
shoulders
overshadowing
her
it
was
almost
like
being
loved
by
a
god
manfred
face
was
pressed
against
her
shoulder
his
open
mouth
on
her
collarbone
she
turned
toward
him
and
saw
the
light
in
his
hair
she
slid
one
hand
up
to
his
hair
and
stroked
it
while
with
the
other
she
rubbed
his
back
in
a
circular
motion
she
felt
the
muscles
in
his
body
tighten
against
her
he
drew
in
a
shuddering
breath
yes
yes
good
she
whispered
still
stroking
his
hair
still
caressing
his
back
he
relaxed
panting
heavily
never
makes
much
noise
nothing
like
my
they
lay
without
moving
she
pleased
by
the
warm
weight
of
him
lying
upon
her
as
if
it
protected
her
from
floating
away
the
feel
of
him
still
inside
her
sent
wavelets
of
pleasure
through
her
still
adrift
on
sensations
of
delight
she
opened
her
eyes
to
stare
up
into
the
shadows
of
the
canopy
overhead
on
the
heavy
bed
curtains
to
her
left
the
late
afternoon
sun
cast
an
oblong
of
yellow
light
with
a
pointed
arch
at
the
top
the
shape
of
an
open
window
nearby
she
knew
well
the
play
of
light
in
this
unoccupied
bedchamber
in
an
upper
part
of
the
castle
manfred
and
she
had
met
here
many
times
they
rolled
together
so
that
they
lay
side
by
side
in
a
nest
of
red
and
purple
cushions
the
silk
bolster
under
them
whispered
as
they
shifted
their
weight
and
the
rope
netting
that
held
it
creaked
manfred
propped
his
head
up
with
one
arm
his
free
hand
toyed
with
the
ringlets
of
her
unbound
hair
she
slid
her
palm
over
his
chest
she
remembered
an
ancient
sculpture
she
had
seen
in
a
home
outside
athens
the
torso
of
a
man
head
missing
arms
broken
off
at
the
shoulders
legs
gone
below
the
knees
the
magnificent
body
had
survived
barbarian
invasions
the
coming
of
christianity
the
iconoclasts
the
frankish
conquest
to
stand
now
on
a
plain
pedestal
in
a
room
with
purple
walls
the
yellowish
marble
gleaming
in
the
light
of
many
candles
her
host
showed
it
only
to
his
most
trusted
guests
which
god
is
this
she
had
asked
i
think
it
is
just
an
athlete
said
her
host
the
old
greeks
made
gods
of
their
athletes
manfred
naked
torso
pale
as
marble
seemed
as
beautiful
and
was
alive
she
sighed
happily
how
lucky
i
am
that
there
was
time
for
love
in
my
king
life
this
afternoon
she
spoke
in
the
sicilian
dialect
manfred
favorite
of
all
his
languages
how
lucky
she
thought
that
after
all
her
years
of
wandering
she
had
at
last
found
a
place
in
the
world
where
she
was
loved
and
needed
his
lips
stretched
in
a
smile
but
his
blue
eyes
were
empty
uneasiness
took
hold
of
her
she
sensed
from
the
look
on
his
face
that
he
was
about
to
tell
her
something
she
did
not
want
to
hear
in
memory
she
heard
a
voice
say
was
ours
not
so
long
ago
and
might
be
ours
so
michael
paleologos
the
basileus
emperor
of
constantinople
had
introduced
the
suggestion
that
she
go
to
italy
and
at
just
such
a
moment
as
this
when
they
were
in
bed
together
in
his
hunting
lodge
outside
nicaea
she
had
felt
no
distress
at
the
idea
of
being
parted
from
michael
he
was
a
scrawny
man
with
a
long
gray
beard
and
though
she
counted
herself
enormously
lucky
to
have
attracted
his
attention
she
felt
no
love
for
him
she
had
come
to
lucera
acting
as
michael
agent
and
personal
emissary
to
manfred
and
resenting
michael
use
of
her
but
feeling
she
had
no
choice
she
was
a
present
from
one
monarch
to
another
she
ought
to
be
flattered
she
supposed
she
had
walked
into
manfred
court
in
the
embroidered
jeweled
mantle
michael
had
given
her
her
hair
bound
up
in
silver
netting
lorenzo
celino
had
conducted
her
to
the
throne
and
she
bowed
and
looked
up
and
it
was
like
gazing
upon
the
sun
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
smile
was
brilliant
his
hair
his
eyes
sapphires
he
stepped
down
from
his
throne
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
his
garden
first
she
gave
him
michael
messages
news
that
a
tartar
army
had
stormed
the
crusader
city
of
sidon
leveled
it
and
ridden
off
again
a
warning
that
pope
urban
had
secretly
offered
the
crown
of
naples
and
sicily
manfred
crown
to
prince
edward
heir
apparent
to
the
throne
of
england
your
royal
master
is
kind
but
the
pope
secret
is
no
secret
manfred
had
said
laughing
and
unconcerned
the
nobility
of
england
have
flatly
told
prince
edward
that
they
will
supply
neither
money
nor
men
for
an
adventure
in
italy
the
pope
must
find
another
robber
baron
to
steal
my
crown
and
then
he
asked
her
about
herself
and
they
talked
about
her
and
about
him
she
had
thought
all
westerners
were
savages
but
manfred
amazed
her
with
his
cultivation
he
knew
more
than
many
byzantines
for
whom
constantinople
which
they
always
called
the
polis
the
city
as
if
it
were
the
only
one
was
the
whole
world
in
the
short
time
she
and
manfred
strolled
together
that
day
he
spoke
to
her
in
greek
latin
and
italian
and
she
later
found
out
that
he
knew
french
german
and
arabic
as
well
he
sang
a
song
to
her
in
a
tongue
she
did
not
recognize
and
he
told
her
it
was
provençal
the
language
of
the
troubadours
he
undid
the
clasp
of
her
mantle
and
let
it
fall
to
the
gravel
he
kissed
her
in
the
bright
sunlight
and
she
forgot
michael
paleologos
she
belonged
altogether
to
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
now
with
a
chill
she
remembered
that
she
did
indeed
to
manfred
she
was
not
his
mate
but
his
servant
his
fingertips
stroked
her
nipple
lightly
but
she
ignored
the
tingle
of
pleasure
she
waited
for
him
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
he
said
remember
the
muslim
who
came
to
the
court
today
the
man
from
egypt
you
had
him
killed
i
changed
my
mind
manfred
said
she
felt
relief
she
was
surprised
at
herself
she
had
wanted
the
man
to
live
she
remembered
her
astonishment
when
with
a
gesture
like
a
performing
magician
manfred
threw
open
the
doors
of
his
audience
hall
and
the
entire
court
saw
the
blond
man
with
his
dagger
at
throat
she
had
been
surprised
when
manfred
told
her
that
this
man
dressed
in
a
drab
tunic
and
hose
like
a
italian
merchant
was
the
awaited
saracen
from
the
sultan
of
egypt
the
sight
of
him
as
he
passed
through
the
audience
hall
had
left
her
momentarily
breathless
he
looked
like
one
of
those
blond
men
of
western
europe
the
people
of
constantinople
called
franks
and
had
learned
to
hate
at
sight
his
hair
was
not
as
light
as
manfred
it
was
darker
more
the
color
of
brass
than
of
gold
manfred
lips
were
full
and
red
but
this
man
mouth
was
a
line
the
mouth
of
a
man
who
had
endured
cruelty
without
complaint
and
could
himself
be
cruel
she
wondered
what
he
had
seen
and
done
as
he
had
passed
her
his
eyes
caught
hers
strange
eyes
she
could
not
tell
what
color
they
were
there
was
a
fixity
in
them
akin
to
madness
the
face
was
expressionless
rocklike
this
she
was
sure
was
no
ordinary
man
to
be
disposed
of
as
an
inconvenience
she
was
not
surprised
manfred
had
decided
to
let
him
live
why
did
you
change
your
mind
i
think
this
mameluke
can
help
me
manfred
said
therefore
i
am
going
to
help
him
he
is
going
to
orvieto
on
a
mission
for
his
sultan
i
am
sending
lorenzo
with
him
what
did
you
call
him
a
mameluke
a
slave
warrior
the
turks
who
rule
in
muslim
lands
take
very
young
boys
as
slaves
and
raise
them
in
barracks
to
be
soldiers
they
forget
their
parents
and
are
trained
with
the
utmost
rigor
they
are
said
to
be
the
finest
warriors
in
the
world
does
a
life
like
that
do
to
a
man
it
must
either
destroy
him
or
make
him
the
man
looks
like
a
frank
she
said
he
comes
of
english
stock
said
manfred
you
byzantines
lump
all
of
us
together
english
and
french
and
germans
as
franks
do
you
not
so
you
can
call
him
a
frank
if
you
like
but
whatever
he
looks
like
he
is
a
turk
at
heart
i
learned
that
from
talking
to
him
it
really
quite
amazing
they
were
plunged
into
deep
shadow
as
the
arched
golden
shape
on
the
bed
curtain
disappeared
a
cloud
having
passed
over
the
sun
despite
the
summer
heat
she
felt
cold
and
even
though
she
did
not
trust
manfred
she
reached
for
him
wanting
him
close
but
manfred
drew
away
from
her
preoccupied
she
pulled
a
crimson
cushion
from
behind
him
and
hugged
it
against
her
breasts
alone
the
mameluke
must
feel
even
here
where
muslims
are
tolerated
they
have
tried
to
kill
him
and
when
he
is
in
the
territory
every
man
will
be
his
she
remembered
the
harsh
face
with
its
prominent
cheekbones
and
gray
eyes
and
thought
perhaps
being
alone
holds
no
terror
for
him
all
i
am
alone
and
i
have
made
the
best
of
what
is
his
mission
in
orvieto
she
asked
she
listened
intently
as
manfred
told
her
a
tale
of
trying
to
prevent
the
great
powers
of
east
and
west
from
joining
together
to
crush
islam
between
them
manfred
continued
david
hopes
to
influence
the
pope
counselors
to
turn
against
the
tartars
that
they
may
sway
the
pope
himself
how
can
one
man
attempt
such
a
huge
undertaking
he
brought
me
an
exceedingly
valuable
stone
an
emerald
which
i
will
trade
for
jewels
he
can
carry
to
orvieto
and
exchange
for
coins
it
pleases
me
greatly
that
the
sultan
would
entrust
me
with
such
a
gem
that
helped
to
change
my
mind
about
this
david
the
saracens
are
men
of
honor
in
their
way
he
smiled
at
her
looking
pleased
with
the
situation
and
pleased
with
himself
but
she
was
quiet
unmoving
waiting
for
him
to
say
the
thing
she
feared
to
hear
but
you
are
right
manfred
went
on
he
can
not
do
it
alone
warm
yellow
light
once
more
filled
their
curtained
cubicle
the
cloud
had
passed
away
from
the
sun
but
her
heart
froze
i
have
decided
i
must
entrust
my
own
most
precious
jewel
to
david
he
put
his
hand
on
hers
no
she
thought
anguish
tearing
at
her
heart
as
his
words
confirmed
her
guess
she
felt
a
terrible
pain
as
if
he
had
run
her
through
with
a
spear
she
wanted
to
clutch
at
him
hold
him
in
spite
of
himself
she
had
not
felt
so
lost
since
her
mother
and
father
and
the
boy
she
loved
were
killed
by
the
franks
she
studied
his
face
to
memorize
it
because
soon
she
would
leave
him
and
probably
never
see
him
again
it
would
do
her
no
good
to
let
him
see
how
she
felt
she
must
decide
what
face
to
show
him
am
a
woman
of
constantinople
alone
in
a
country
of
strangers
and
we
are
an
ancient
people
wise
and
subtle
and
we
bide
our
she
sat
up
in
the
bed
hugging
her
knees
thinking
how
will
my
going
with
him
help
you
he
grunted
softly
and
she
looked
at
him
he
appeared
relieved
she
was
making
it
easy
for
him
she
felt
the
beginning
of
dislike
for
him
stirring
within
her
i
thought
you
would
be
perfect
for
this
and
you
are
his
words
puzzled
her
and
she
almost
let
her
growing
anger
show
i
do
not
see
what
you
see
sire
we
are
in
bed
you
may
call
me
manfred
i
do
not
want
to
call
you
what
is
it
you
think
i
would
be
so
good
at
you
can
mask
your
feelings
he
said
with
a
smile
you
are
doing
it
now
you
are
very
good
at
it
thank
you
sire
he
shook
his
head
sat
up
beside
her
and
put
an
arm
around
her
shoulders
i
meant
it
when
i
said
you
are
precious
to
me
but
you
must
go
with
this
man
i
can
not
tell
you
all
my
reasons
but
it
is
for
your
own
safety
as
well
no
doubt
he
was
being
honest
with
her
though
he
was
not
telling
her
everything
just
the
other
day
one
of
manfred
servants
whom
she
had
cultivated
with
gifts
warned
her
that
manfred
queen
helene
of
cyprus
was
demanding
that
manfred
break
with
sophia
of
course
manfred
would
never
be
willing
to
admit
that
his
wife
could
force
him
to
do
such
a
thing
she
wanted
to
get
off
by
herself
and
think
this
out
and
cry
let
tears
release
some
of
the
pain
she
felt
this
curtained
bed
confined
her
like
a
dungeon
cell
she
found
her
white
shift
amid
the
rumpled
bedclothes
getting
up
on
her
knees
she
raised
the
shift
over
her
head
and
struggled
into
it
where
are
you
going
manfred
asked
she
crawled
around
the
bed
to
look
for
her
gown
and
her
belt
i
have
arrangements
to
make
packing
to
do
i
have
not
dismissed
you
he
said
a
bit
sullenly
yes
you
have
she
said
deliberately
making
her
voice
so
low
that
it
would
be
hard
for
him
to
hear
you
have
not
heard
everything
he
took
her
arm
she
wanted
to
pull
away
but
she
let
him
hold
her
i
need
your
help
he
went
on
you
see
if
david
fails
in
a
year
or
two
i
may
be
dead
he
let
go
of
her
she
picked
up
the
blue
gown
she
had
so
eagerly
thrown
off
an
hour
ago
her
fingers
crushed
the
silk
she
wanted
to
be
alone
but
she
needed
to
learn
more
she
paused
kneeling
beside
him
god
forbid
sire
why
should
you
be
dead
this
time
the
pope
is
offering
my
crown
to
the
french
sitting
down
laying
the
gown
in
her
lap
she
sighed
and
turned
all
her
attention
to
him
why
can
you
not
make
peace
with
the
pope
why
is
he
so
determined
to
dethrone
you
like
all
storied
feuds
it
goes
back
so
far
that
no
one
can
remember
what
started
it
said
manfred
smiling
with
his
lips
but
not
his
eyes
at
present
the
pope
refuses
to
recognize
me
because
my
father
promised
to
give
up
the
crown
of
sicily
he
paused
a
moment
and
fixed
her
with
a
strangely
intent
stare
and
because
my
father
did
not
marry
my
mother
even
though
he
loved
her
only
and
never
loved
any
of
his
three
empresses
is
trying
to
tell
me
sophia
thought
but
before
she
could
reply
he
went
on
with
his
tale
of
the
hohenstaufens
and
the
popes
as
the
popes
see
it
to
have
a
hohenstaufen
ruling
southern
italy
and
sicily
is
like
having
a
knife
at
their
throats
this
pope
urban
is
a
frenchman
and
he
is
trying
to
get
the
french
to
help
him
drive
us
out
the
french
it
was
the
french
who
over
fifty
years
ago
had
stormed
constantinople
looted
it
and
ruled
over
it
until
driven
out
by
michael
paleologos
and
now
the
french
threatened
manfred
from
his
island
of
sicily
how
easy
to
launch
another
invasion
of
constantinople
in
memory
she
saw
alexis
the
boy
she
loved
fall
as
the
french
crossbow
bolt
hit
him
she
heard
him
cry
out
to
her
sophia
go
was
i
saved
that
night
if
not
that
i
might
help
to
stop
the
french
from
conquering
constantinople
again
i
can
not
send
an
army
to
orvieto
to
stop
the
pope
intrigues
against
me
manfred
said
that
would
turn
all
christendom
against
me
but
i
can
send
my
two
best
people
my
brave
and
clever
lorenzo
and
my
beautiful
and
clever
sophia
together
with
david
you
two
perhaps
can
turn
my
enemies
against
each
other
you
may
be
gone
six
months
or
a
year
and
afterward
you
can
come
back
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
hers
as
he
said
it
but
there
was
a
flickering
in
their
depths
that
told
her
he
was
not
being
honest
with
her
when
will
i
meet
this
mameluke
tomorrow
we
go
falconing
the
forest
is
a
good
place
to
talk
freely
he
paused
and
grinned
at
her
but
do
not
dress
just
yet
this
may
be
my
last
chance
to
enjoy
your
lovely
body
she
looked
away
she
felt
no
desire
for
him
she
was
sick
of
being
enjoyed
forgive
me
sire
i
have
much
to
do
she
said
before
he
could
object
she
had
slipped
through
the
curtains
around
the
bed
and
was
pulling
her
blue
gown
over
her
head
she
had
left
half
her
clothes
behind
with
manfred
but
that
did
not
matter
her
own
quarters
were
near
and
later
she
could
send
a
servant
for
her
things
as
she
hurried
out
the
door
she
pretended
not
to
hear
manfred
angry
cry
muffled
by
the
bed
thick
curtains
sophia
wrapped
in
white
linen
the
satin
mantle
in
which
she
had
been
presented
at
manfred
court
she
laid
it
in
her
traveling
chest
then
brought
her
jewel
box
from
the
table
on
which
it
had
stood
since
arrived
here
and
laid
it
on
the
mantle
manfred
would
gladly
have
ordered
servants
to
do
this
packing
for
her
but
it
was
easier
to
preserve
her
privacy
when
she
did
for
herself
she
looked
down
at
the
polished
ebony
box
with
the
eagle
of
constantinople
in
inlay
a
gift
from
the
basileus
when
he
sent
her
to
sicily
the
eagle
of
constantinople
tradition
said
was
the
inspiration
for
the
hohenstaufen
eagle
she
folded
a
green
woolen
tunic
and
laid
it
over
the
jewel
box
as
she
stood
with
her
hands
pressed
on
the
tunic
sorrow
welled
up
within
her
there
ever
a
woman
more
alone
in
the
world
than
i
am
in
one
night
made
hideous
by
the
flames
of
the
burning
city
and
the
screams
of
the
dying
she
had
lost
her
father
demetrios
karaiannides
the
silversmith
and
her
mother
danuta
and
her
two
sisters
euphemia
and
eirene
the
people
of
the
polis
had
risen
against
the
franks
and
the
franks
had
retaliated
by
killing
everyone
they
could
lay
hands
upon
the
boy
she
was
going
to
marry
the
boy
she
loved
had
fled
with
her
to
the
marmara
waterfront
there
they
found
a
small
boat
and
then
the
crossbow
bolt
had
torn
through
his
back
dying
he
cast
her
adrift
sophia
go
from
then
on
she
was
alone
am
i
what
is
a
woman
alone
not
a
queen
or
an
empress
not
a
wife
or
a
mother
not
a
daughter
not
a
nun
not
mistress
now
that
michael
and
manfred
had
each
sent
her
away
not
courtesan
or
even
harlot
crossing
the
bosporus
to
asia
minor
she
had
survived
she
did
not
care
to
remember
the
means
by
which
she
survived
of
all
of
them
the
least
dishonorable
was
theft
she
let
herself
be
used
and
she
could
be
very
useful
she
found
her
way
to
the
byzantine
general
michael
paleologos
who
wanted
to
take
constantinople
back
from
the
franks
her
help
had
been
important
to
michael
and
he
had
rewarded
her
after
he
reconquered
the
polis
and
made
himself
its
basileus
by
keeping
her
as
his
favorite
for
a
time
and
she
had
rejoiced
to
see
constantinople
liberated
from
the
barbarians
even
though
no
one
she
loved
was
left
alive
in
it
then
michael
had
made
her
leave
the
one
place
she
loved
sending
her
to
manfred
in
italy
and
now
just
when
she
had
begun
to
lose
the
feeling
of
not
belonging
anywhere
just
when
she
felt
she
had
found
safe
harbor
with
manfred
she
was
cut
loose
again
she
felt
the
tears
coming
and
fought
them
she
turned
her
mind
away
from
the
questions
that
plagued
her
and
thought
about
her
packing
simon
should
go
into
the
chest
in
the
center
where
clothing
above
and
below
would
protect
him
she
went
to
the
table
by
the
window
where
the
small
icon
stood
between
two
candles
in
tall
brass
candlesticks
she
picked
up
the
saint
and
reverently
kissed
his
forehead
then
held
the
icon
out
at
arm
length
to
look
at
it
the
eyes
dominated
the
portrait
transfixing
her
with
a
blue
stare
she
had
painted
it
herself
a
few
years
before
copying
another
larger
icon
that
belonged
to
the
basileus
michael
simon
cheeks
were
hollow
his
mouth
a
tight
line
his
chin
sharp
his
hair
hung
brown
and
lank
to
his
shoulders
framing
his
face
she
had
used
real
gold
dust
in
the
paint
for
the
halo
michael
was
generous
to
her
and
he
laughed
when
she
told
him
that
she
spent
some
of
the
money
he
gave
her
on
expensive
paint
for
an
icon
the
idea
of
a
woman
who
painted
amused
him
like
the
bear
that
danced
in
the
hippodrome
beyond
the
gold
of
the
halo
was
the
ocher
of
the
desert
and
standing
lonely
over
the
saint
right
shoulder
the
pillar
on
which
he
had
lived
in
penance
for
fifteen
years
the
pillar
that
had
given
him
his
name
simon
stylites
do
i
reverence
this
saint
because
he
knew
how
to
endure
alone
and
that
is
what
is
most
well
dear
she
prayed
as
she
lowered
the
icon
into
the
cedar
chest
she
closed
the
gilded
wooden
doors
that
protected
the
painting
breaking
the
grip
of
simon
staring
blue
eyes
she
next
opened
a
small
box
of
dark
polished
wood
its
lid
inlaid
with
bits
of
forming
a
bird
with
swirling
wings
a
dozen
small
porcelain
jars
lay
in
recesses
shaped
to
hold
them
each
jar
was
ornamented
with
the
same
floral
pattern
in
a
different
color
each
color
that
of
the
powdered
pigment
the
tightly
corked
jar
contained
take
a
pinch
of
the
powder
add
water
and
the
clear
liquid
from
a
raw
egg
and
you
had
a
paint
wrapped
in
linen
at
one
end
of
the
box
were
her
quill
pens
brushes
and
charcoal
sticks
as
always
the
sight
of
her
materials
made
her
want
to
stop
what
she
was
doing
and
paint
she
closed
the
lid
gently
stroking
its
cover
remembering
the
merchant
from
soldaia
in
the
crimea
who
had
sold
her
the
box
outside
the
church
of
saint
john
in
stoudion
telling
her
it
came
from
a
land
far
to
the
east
called
cathay
cathayans
must
be
as
civilized
as
we
are
to
make
such
a
she
thought
as
she
put
the
box
in
her
chest
this
blond
saracen
this
mameluke
whom
she
had
seen
briefly
and
would
meet
again
tomorrow
would
not
be
a
civilized
man
he
was
both
turk
and
frank
barbarity
coupled
with
barbarity
kriste
eleison
she
whispered
christ
have
mercy
until
this
moment
she
had
been
able
to
stave
off
her
fear
of
the
danger
she
was
going
into
now
it
struck
her
full
force
leaving
her
paralyzed
over
her
traveling
chest
her
trembling
hand
still
resting
on
her
box
of
paints
as
if
it
were
a
talisman
that
could
protect
her
she
was
going
among
the
worst
enemies
her
people
had
on
earth
more
to
be
feared
than
the
saracens
the
latin
christians
of
the
west
the
floor
seemed
to
shake
under
her
and
her
body
went
cold
and
then
hot
as
she
thought
of
what
she
must
face
if
they
found
out
that
she
was
a
woman
of
constantinople
they
would
tear
the
flesh
from
her
bones
woman
of
constantinople
helping
a
saracen
to
plot
against
the
pope
fear
was
like
a
cold
black
ocean
and
she
was
drowning
in
it
she
dared
not
even
let
herself
imagine
the
horrors
the
torments
that
would
end
her
life
if
those
people
in
orvieto
found
her
out
she
did
not
have
to
go
through
with
it
once
she
and
lorenzo
and
this
david
this
mameluke
were
on
the
road
she
could
slip
away
manfred
had
said
they
would
be
carrying
jewels
perhaps
she
could
take
some
use
them
to
buy
passage
for
herself
to
where
there
was
no
place
in
the
world
she
belonged
but
constantinople
and
her
place
in
the
polis
was
dependent
on
the
basileus
michael
if
she
angered
manfred
she
could
not
dare
go
back
to
michael
to
be
forever
exiled
from
constantinople
would
be
a
living
death
in
her
mind
she
saw
the
polis
glowing
golden
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
she
saw
the
great
gray
walls
that
had
protected
constantinople
against
barbarian
invaders
from
east
and
west
for
a
thousand
years
she
saw
the
gorgeous
pink
marble
of
the
blachernae
palace
of
the
basileus
the
statue
of
justinian
astride
his
horse
his
hand
raised
toward
the
east
the
great
dome
of
hagia
sophia
her
namesake
saint
that
seemed
to
float
over
the
city
held
in
place
by
an
army
of
angels
she
heard
the
roar
of
the
crowd
watching
chariots
race
in
the
hippodrome
and
the
cries
of
the
merchants
from
their
shops
along
the
arcaded
mese
the
polis
was
the
hub
of
the
world
the
fulfillment
of
all
desires
the
vision
sent
strength
and
purpose
surging
through
her
body
and
she
straightened
up
took
her
hand
from
the
paint
box
and
began
moving
around
the
room
again
collecting
her
possessions
she
would
go
with
lorenzo
and
the
mameluke
and
do
as
she
had
always
done
whatever
was
necessary
she
would
see
this
thing
through
with
the
help
of
god
she
might
prevail
after
that
what
future
for
a
woman
as
alone
as
sophia
karaiannides
she
shrugged
time
enough
to
think
about
the
future
after
she
had
been
to
orvieto
and
lived
through
it
of
one
thing
she
was
already
sure
she
would
not
come
back
to
manfred
she
went
back
to
her
table
from
a
reading
stand
at
its
side
she
picked
up
her
book
of
parchment
sheets
and
opened
it
to
a
page
marked
by
a
ribbon
she
studied
the
portrait
of
manfred
she
had
begun
only
two
days
before
most
of
it
was
still
rough
charcoal
strokes
but
she
had
colored
his
beard
in
a
mixture
of
yellow
and
white
paints
because
it
was
the
most
important
color
and
she
wanted
to
get
it
down
first
so
it
could
control
her
choice
of
the
other
colors
the
eyes
would
be
last
because
when
she
painted
in
the
eyes
the
picture
would
in
a
sense
come
to
life
even
with
the
eyes
blank
the
portrait
seemed
to
smile
at
her
and
she
felt
a
ripple
of
remembered
pleasure
grief
followed
almost
at
once
i
try
to
finish
this
tonight
and
give
it
to
him
as
a
parting
gift
after
a
moment
thought
her
fingers
clawed
at
the
parchment
and
tore
it
free
of
the
stitches
that
held
it
in
the
book
she
rolled
it
up
and
held
an
end
to
a
candle
flame
v
keeping
his
face
severe
simon
de
gobignon
walked
slowly
past
the
six
knights
lined
up
on
the
wharf
the
men
faces
were
scarlet
and
glistening
with
sweat
under
their
conical
steel
helmets
simon
felt
rivulets
running
down
his
own
back
under
his
padded
cotton
undershirt
mail
hauberk
and
surcoat
gulls
screamed
overhead
and
the
smell
of
the
salt
sea
and
of
rotting
fish
hung
heavy
in
the
warm
air
venice
in
july
simon
thought
was
no
place
to
be
dressed
in
full
battle
gear
the
two
banners
held
by
at
the
end
of
the
line
hung
limply
the
royal
standard
of
france
gold
on
an
azure
ground
and
that
of
gobignon
gold
crowns
on
purple
simon
reproached
himself
he
had
brought
his
company
down
to
the
waterfront
too
early
as
soon
as
he
had
word
that
the
galley
bearing
the
tartar
ambassadors
from
cyprus
was
in
the
harbor
it
was
there
sure
enough
he
could
see
it
a
long
dark
shape
a
few
hundred
feet
from
shore
but
it
rode
at
anchor
while
officials
of
the
most
serene
republic
inspected
it
for
diseases
and
registered
its
cargo
a
task
that
had
already
taken
hours
while
simon
and
his
men
sweltered
onshore
behind
the
knights
stood
a
lance
of
archers
forty
men
in
four
rows
they
were
talking
and
laughing
among
themselves
in
the
venetian
dialect
which
simon
could
barely
understand
while
growing
up
he
had
learned
the
speech
of
sicily
but
that
was
nearly
a
different
language
the
crossbowmen
should
not
be
chattering
simon
thought
it
was
unmilitary
besides
it
irritated
him
and
added
to
the
tension
of
this
endless
waiting
he
took
a
step
back
and
shouted
silencio
the
archers
looked
up
and
he
saw
more
surprise
and
annoyance
than
respect
in
their
faces
some
eyed
him
expectantly
as
if
they
thought
him
about
to
make
a
speech
he
glared
at
the
archers
for
what
he
felt
was
a
suitable
interval
then
turned
away
and
walked
out
to
the
edge
of
the
jetty
his
thumbs
hooked
in
his
sword
belt
he
ignored
the
muttering
that
arose
the
moment
he
turned
his
back
scusi
your
signory
said
a
rasping
voice
at
his
elbow
simon
turned
andrea
sordello
capitano
of
the
archers
smiled
broadly
at
him
revealing
a
gap
where
one
of
his
eye
teeth
should
have
been
the
bridge
of
his
nose
was
smashed
flat
what
is
it
sordello
the
capitano
had
met
him
in
venice
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
count
charles
brother
of
king
louis
of
france
but
a
insolence
in
the
manner
of
this
bravo
made
simon
uneasy
if
your
signory
wishes
to
command
the
crossbowmen
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
transmit
your
orders
through
me
the
men
do
not
understand
why
you
silenced
them
just
now
they
are
not
used
to
being
told
to
stand
like
statues
for
no
reason
you
would
like
to
make
yourself
popular
with
them
by
disputing
my
order
would
you
not
tell
them
they
have
entered
the
service
of
the
kingdom
of
france
he
told
sordello
it
is
customary
for
french
soldiers
to
maintain
a
military
bearing
and
discipline
forgive
me
your
signory
but
that
may
offend
them
it
is
not
my
duty
to
tell
them
what
they
want
to
hear
but
what
they
hear
said
simon
well
he
thought
to
himself
sì
your
signory
sordello
walked
away
he
had
a
slight
limp
simon
noticed
the
man
had
certainly
been
battered
even
so
uncle
letter
said
he
was
a
fine
troubadour
or
trovatore
as
they
called
them
in
italy
monseigneur
a
shout
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
alain
de
pirenne
his
closest
friend
among
the
six
gobignon
knights
he
had
brought
with
him
was
pointing
out
at
the
harbor
the
two
rows
of
oars
on
either
side
of
the
galley
were
in
motion
even
at
this
distance
simon
could
hear
the
drumbeat
and
the
overseer
calling
count
simon
had
heard
songs
comparing
the
oars
of
galleys
to
the
wings
of
birds
and
he
could
see
the
resemblance
as
the
rows
of
oars
looking
delicate
as
feathers
from
this
distance
rose
and
fell
over
the
water
in
unison
thank
heaven
said
simon
indeed
said
alain
i
am
starting
to
feel
more
like
a
baked
pigeon
than
a
man
as
the
galley
swung
in
to
the
wharf
ropes
flying
through
the
air
to
make
her
fast
to
shore
simon
heard
a
sudden
outcry
behind
him
and
jerked
his
head
around
make
way
for
the
most
serene
make
way
for
the
doge
runners
shouted
musicians
blowing
oliphants
cranking
and
pounding
on
drums
led
a
bright
procession
along
the
wharves
two
men
in
scarlet
tunics
stiff
with
gold
braid
held
poles
between
which
swung
a
huge
banner
on
the
banner
a
winged
lion
in
gold
strode
across
a
green
background
simon
saw
rows
of
gleaming
helmets
and
naked
swords
held
upright
followed
by
ranks
of
men
in
glittering
brocaded
robes
emerald
and
silver
maroon
and
gold
towering
over
all
was
a
huge
sedan
chair
with
a
gilded
roof
and
cloth
of
gold
curtains
followed
by
a
troop
of
men
with
tall
spears
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
in
bright
silk
tunics
and
satin
gowns
laughing
and
chattering
brought
up
the
rear
a
man
in
an
gown
his
cap
heavy
with
gold
thread
confronted
simon
he
was
simon
recalled
a
camerlengo
who
had
been
present
two
weeks
before
when
he
had
his
brief
audience
with
the
doge
and
presented
his
charter
from
king
louis
count
your
troops
are
occupying
the
place
needed
by
the
doge
that
he
may
properly
greet
our
guests
move
them
if
you
please
the
if
you
please
was
uttered
in
a
tone
so
perfunctory
as
to
be
almost
insulting
simon
face
burned
and
his
muscles
tensed
but
when
the
ruler
of
venice
demanded
that
he
give
way
he
was
in
no
position
to
quarrel
he
bowed
curtly
and
turned
to
order
his
men
to
vacate
the
wharf
and
so
after
waiting
for
hours
simon
suddenly
found
himself
watching
the
arrival
of
the
ambassadors
from
behind
ranks
of
venetian
archers
far
more
smartly
turned
out
than
his
own
mercenaries
why
simon
wondered
had
the
doge
not
made
a
place
for
him
in
this
welcoming
ceremony
the
slight
made
him
feel
angry
at
himself
as
much
as
at
the
doge
is
me
uncle
charles
should
have
sent
an
older
man
more
able
to
command
first
to
come
down
the
boarding
ramp
of
the
galley
from
cyprus
was
a
friar
in
a
brown
robe
with
a
white
cord
wrapped
around
his
waist
the
crown
of
his
scalp
was
shaved
and
his
beard
was
long
and
white
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
kissed
it
with
a
loud
smacking
sound
he
rose
and
bowed
to
the
doge
sedan
chair
the
doge
of
venice
rainerio
zeno
emerged
through
curtains
held
for
him
by
two
equerries
in
purple
zeno
was
a
very
old
toothless
man
whose
black
eyes
glittered
like
a
raven
his
bald
head
was
covered
by
a
white
cap
bordered
with
pearls
his
mantle
looked
stiff
and
hard
as
the
shell
of
a
beetle
pages
stood
on
either
side
of
him
and
he
leaned
heavily
on
their
shoulders
using
them
as
crutches
the
friar
bent
and
kissed
zeno
ring
simon
could
not
hear
what
the
doge
and
the
friar
said
to
each
other
the
friar
gestured
toward
the
ship
armed
men
simon
counted
ten
of
them
tramped
down
the
boarding
ramp
and
formed
two
lines
leading
to
the
doge
they
were
short
and
swarthy
wearing
red
and
black
breastplates
of
lacquered
leather
and
round
steel
helmets
polished
to
a
dazzling
finish
topped
with
spikes
bows
were
slung
crosswise
over
their
shoulders
and
long
curved
swords
hung
from
their
belts
were
these
tartars
he
wondered
their
swords
looked
very
much
like
the
one
simon
wore
simon
was
an
egyptian
scimitar
one
of
his
most
precious
possessions
not
because
of
its
jeweled
hilt
a
pearl
set
just
behind
the
guard
a
ruby
at
the
end
of
the
hilt
and
a
row
of
smaller
precious
stones
all
along
the
grip
but
because
of
the
one
who
had
given
it
to
him
and
yet
much
as
he
prized
it
the
scimitar
hurt
him
each
time
he
looked
at
it
reminding
him
of
his
darkest
secret
a
secret
known
to
only
three
living
people
simon
whole
life
the
scimitar
reminded
him
was
built
on
a
lie
and
he
had
accepted
this
mission
in
part
to
expiate
the
shame
he
felt
when
he
remembered
that
now
simon
feeling
very
much
out
of
his
depth
touched
the
hilt
of
his
scimitar
for
reassurance
but
as
he
recalled
that
the
sword
had
once
belonged
to
a
saracen
ruler
his
heart
leapt
in
fear
never
knows
when
or
how
the
saracens
may
count
charles
uncle
charles
had
warned
him
arrow
from
ambush
the
dagger
that
cuts
the
throat
of
a
sleeping
victim
poison
when
they
can
not
kill
they
try
to
corrupt
with
gold
and
lies
and
they
have
allies
in
italy
the
pope
enemy
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
and
his
supporters
the
ghibellini
you
must
be
on
guard
every
simon
eyes
swept
the
row
of
stone
palaces
that
overlooked
this
part
of
the
waterfront
their
battlements
offering
hundreds
of
fine
hiding
places
for
killers
an
enemy
had
only
to
gain
surreptitious
entrance
to
one
of
those
great
houses
not
hard
to
do
when
everyone
attention
was
turned
toward
the
galley
bringing
the
tartars
should
i
do
the
doge
outnumber
mine
and
look
to
be
better
soldiers
and
it
seems
the
tartars
have
brought
their
own
warriors
perhaps
i
am
not
needed
the
thought
brought
him
momentary
relief
but
then
simon
realized
that
he
was
yielding
to
the
temptation
that
had
assailed
him
throughout
his
life
the
urge
to
conceal
himself
did
i
not
undertake
this
task
to
uphold
my
family
good
name
and
my
right
to
bear
it
and
besides
it
is
not
only
my
dignity
that
must
be
upheld
here
but
the
honor
of
king
louis
if
anything
happens
to
the
tartars
now
that
they
are
on
christian
soil
i
will
have
failed
my
simon
was
about
to
push
forward
to
demand
room
for
his
men
when
the
friar
who
had
just
disembarked
raised
his
arm
simon
gaze
followed
the
direction
of
the
gesture
and
came
to
rest
at
the
head
of
the
boarding
ramp
there
stood
two
of
the
men
simon
had
ever
seen
their
faces
were
the
deep
brown
of
leather
the
eyebrows
were
little
black
banners
flying
above
black
slitted
eyes
that
peered
out
over
the
battlements
of
jutting
cheekbones
their
mustaches
were
thin
and
hung
down
in
long
strands
below
small
chins
adorned
with
sparse
beards
one
man
beard
was
white
the
other
black
but
even
the
man
was
not
young
there
were
deep
creases
in
his
face
both
men
wore
cylindrical
caps
each
topped
with
a
polished
spherical
red
stone
their
robes
were
of
maroon
silk
brocaded
with
gold
thread
and
they
wore
short
jackets
with
flowing
sleeves
from
the
neck
of
each
man
hung
a
rectangular
tablet
on
a
gold
chain
simon
wonder
turned
to
fear
as
he
realized
what
perfect
targets
the
tartar
ambassadors
were
making
of
themselves
he
threw
his
weight
against
the
men
and
women
in
front
of
him
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
found
himself
facing
one
of
the
archers
the
man
raised
his
crossbow
threateningly
but
simon
saw
immediately
that
it
was
not
loaded
fine
protection
for
the
emissaries
de
pirenne
de
puys
simon
called
to
the
two
french
knights
nearest
him
follow
me
he
turned
back
to
the
venetian
crossbowman
and
shouted
stand
aside
in
his
loudest
voice
i
am
the
count
de
gobignon
as
he
had
hoped
the
sound
of
his
command
carried
to
doge
zeno
whose
face
wrinkled
as
a
yellow
raisin
turned
in
simon
direction
serenity
simon
called
using
the
customary
form
of
address
for
the
doge
it
is
my
duty
to
guard
these
ambassadors
sordello
at
simon
elbow
said
in
a
low
voice
you
are
a
great
lord
in
your
own
land
your
signory
but
it
would
be
best
if
you
did
not
arouse
the
wrath
of
the
doge
of
venice
be
still
simon
snapped
helmeted
archers
moved
in
on
simon
from
all
sides
but
simon
saw
the
doge
give
an
abrupt
hand
signal
to
their
capitano
at
a
shouted
order
from
the
capitano
the
fell
back
letting
simon
through
why
do
you
disturb
our
ceremonies
young
count
the
doge
voice
was
a
hoarse
whisper
he
smiled
faintly
but
his
eyes
were
cold
as
winter
simon
felt
painfully
embarrassed
the
ruler
of
the
mightiest
city
on
the
middle
sea
was
after
all
as
puissant
as
any
king
on
earth
simon
fell
to
one
knee
before
the
doge
forgive
me
serenity
i
only
wish
to
aid
you
in
protecting
the
emissaries
from
tartary
as
my
king
has
commanded
me
his
knees
trembled
and
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
were
hammering
hard
enough
to
break
his
ribs
the
smile
faded
and
the
aged
eyes
grew
icier
does
the
frankish
count
think
venice
too
feeble
to
protect
her
distinguished
visitors
not
at
all
serenity
said
simon
hastily
only
let
me
add
my
strength
to
yours
say
no
more
said
the
doge
in
a
voice
as
sharp
as
a
dagger
by
now
the
two
tartars
had
descended
the
ramp
and
were
standing
before
the
doge
for
a
moment
simon
eyes
met
those
of
the
tartar
and
he
felt
a
new
inexplicable
and
powerful
fear
he
took
a
step
backward
almost
as
if
he
had
been
struck
a
physical
blow
and
he
gripped
his
sword
hilt
for
reassurance
the
tartar
turned
his
gaze
to
the
doge
and
simon
fear
faded
leaving
him
to
wonder
what
there
was
in
this
little
man
to
inspire
it
what
he
had
seen
in
those
eyes
a
hardness
a
gaze
as
empty
of
concern
for
simon
de
gobignon
as
the
cloudless
blue
sky
overhead
the
friar
said
serenity
this
is
john
chagan
noyon
indicating
the
older
tartar
a
noyon
among
the
tartars
is
equal
in
rank
to
a
prince
in
our
lands
the
khan
hulagu
sends
you
a
prince
to
show
how
earnestly
he
wishes
to
ally
himself
with
christendom
to
destroy
our
mutual
enemies
the
muslims
this
other
gentleman
is
philip
uzbek
baghadur
means
valiant
and
he
is
a
a
commander
of
ten
thousand
he
holds
high
place
in
the
councils
of
hulagu
khan
each
tartar
clasped
his
hands
before
him
and
bowed
low
to
the
doge
as
his
name
was
spoken
how
is
it
that
they
have
christian
names
asked
the
doge
the
franciscan
friar
smiled
john
chagan
comes
of
an
old
christian
family
formerly
subject
to
the
great
christian
king
of
asia
prester
john
and
philip
uzbek
was
baptized
in
his
youth
by
the
bishop
of
karakorum
the
doge
waved
his
bony
hands
making
his
heavy
garments
rustle
christian
tartars
prester
john
the
bishop
of
this
is
too
much
for
an
old
man
to
grasp
all
at
once
but
surely
i
can
learn
much
from
you
and
these
noble
gentlemen
that
will
be
good
for
venice
tell
them
that
i
invite
them
to
bear
me
company
to
my
palace
where
we
will
dine
together
tonight
and
i
will
learn
more
of
the
marvels
of
the
empire
of
tartary
simon
knew
that
the
doge
palace
was
more
than
half
a
mile
down
the
avenue
along
this
bank
of
the
grand
canal
and
the
prospect
of
the
ambassadors
parading
that
distance
alarmed
him
again
his
fear
of
disaster
came
back
full
force
driving
him
once
again
against
all
courtesy
to
speak
out
serenity
i
beg
the
privilege
of
joining
forces
with
you
to
escort
the
ambassadors
to
your
palace
anger
blazed
in
the
gaze
the
doge
turned
upon
him
this
time
young
man
if
you
speak
out
of
turn
once
more
i
will
have
you
thrown
into
the
canal
simon
had
no
doubt
that
the
doge
would
enjoy
making
good
on
his
threat
but
would
the
ruler
of
venice
allow
an
undignified
scuffle
on
the
waterfront
in
the
presence
of
two
ambassadors
simon
doubted
it
and
decided
to
stand
his
ground
forgive
me
serenity
he
said
inclining
his
head
it
is
my
concern
for
these
precious
lives
that
urges
me
to
speak
out
the
doge
took
a
deep
breath
then
his
small
mouth
twitched
in
a
smile
very
well
count
you
may
follow
after
us
while
the
doge
presented
the
assembled
venetian
dignitaries
to
the
tartars
simon
ordered
henri
de
puys
and
alain
de
pirenne
to
draw
up
the
knights
and
sordello
to
form
up
the
archers
and
be
ready
to
follow
the
ambassadors
train
bearers
brought
a
sedan
chair
for
the
tartars
who
climbed
into
it
with
bows
and
smiles
to
simon
distress
the
conveyance
was
open
naturally
enough
since
the
tartars
would
want
to
see
venice
and
the
venetians
would
want
to
see
them
but
it
meant
still
more
danger
the
franciscan
friar
came
over
and
put
his
hand
on
simon
arm
you
are
very
brave
young
man
to
speak
up
to
the
ruler
of
venice
as
you
did
and
who
might
you
be
simon
introduced
himself
and
the
friar
bowed
and
addressed
him
in
french
how
good
to
speak
the
language
of
my
homeland
again
i
am
mathieu
of
the
little
brothers
of
san
francesco
and
i
was
born
near
limoges
which
is
not
far
from
your
estate
count
of
course
no
place
in
france
is
far
from
gobignon
lands
his
broad
smile
told
simon
the
remark
was
meant
in
friendly
jest
it
was
our
good
king
louis
who
sent
me
to
the
tartars
years
ago
i
am
glad
we
will
be
in
french
hands
after
we
leave
venice
he
gave
simon
arm
a
squeeze
and
returned
to
the
doge
procession
simon
had
begun
to
think
the
whole
world
had
turned
against
him
and
friar
mathieu
friendly
words
cheered
him
immensely
he
watched
the
friar
with
a
warm
feeling
as
he
shook
his
head
at
the
attendants
who
held
a
sedan
chair
for
him
as
befitted
a
good
franciscan
sworn
to
poverty
and
dedicated
to
simplicity
the
friar
would
allow
no
one
to
carry
him
but
insisted
on
walking
on
his
own
sandaled
feet
behind
the
tartars
chair
simon
and
his
men
followed
the
last
contingent
of
the
doge
foot
soldiers
along
the
waterfront
ahead
a
stone
bridge
arched
over
one
of
the
many
venetian
canals
the
procession
was
moving
slowly
now
after
crossing
the
bridge
simon
saw
the
ambassadors
sedan
chair
swing
around
a
corner
and
his
pulse
quickened
because
those
he
was
to
protect
were
out
of
his
sight
he
wanted
to
hurry
to
the
corner
but
the
street
narrowed
here
with
the
windowless
white
ground
floor
of
a
palazzo
on
one
side
and
an
iron
railing
on
the
other
there
was
no
room
to
bypass
those
ahead
simon
hurried
his
pace
until
he
was
all
but
treading
on
the
heels
of
the
spearman
in
front
of
him
he
turned
the
corner
into
the
small
square
in
front
of
the
palace
he
saw
the
doge
sedan
chair
and
that
of
the
tartars
pass
through
the
gateway
between
the
palace
and
the
great
basilica
of
san
marco
then
he
stopped
short
feeling
as
if
he
had
crashed
headfirst
into
a
wall
the
tall
gates
leading
into
the
palace
swung
shut
and
facing
him
was
a
triple
line
of
of
the
most
serene
republic
in
green
and
gold
tunics
and
armed
with
long
spears
mère
de
dieu
he
whispered
he
could
not
force
his
way
into
the
palace
if
he
even
tried
he
would
only
look
ridiculous
indeed
he
doubted
that
his
men
would
fight
the
mercenaries
were
venetians
too
and
why
would
they
obey
the
command
of
a
french
seigneur
who
had
hired
them
only
yesterday
to
fight
their
own
countrymen
it
appears
we
are
not
welcome
at
the
palace
your
signory
said
a
voice
at
his
side
simon
turned
and
glared
at
sordello
whose
face
seemed
to
mask
amusement
simon
tried
to
think
of
a
way
to
rescue
his
dignity
find
the
leader
of
the
palace
guards
and
tell
him
i
want
to
speak
to
him
sordello
shrugged
as
you
wish
your
signory
alain
de
pirenne
his
gauntleted
fist
clenched
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
blustered
out
damned
italian
discourtesy
it
would
serve
them
right
if
somebody
did
slip
a
dagger
into
those
tartars
while
we
stand
out
here
forbid
thought
simon
sordello
came
back
with
a
venetian
who
touched
the
brim
of
his
polished
respectfully
this
sergente
has
a
message
for
you
from
his
serenity
the
doge
your
signory
let
him
tell
it
simon
command
of
the
venetian
dialect
was
not
good
enough
to
follow
what
the
man
in
the
said
and
to
make
it
harder
he
spoke
in
what
appeared
to
be
an
embarrassed
mumble
what
did
he
say
sordello
forgive
me
your
signory
said
sordello
the
message
may
offend
you
i
will
repeat
it
only
if
you
wish
it
what
did
he
say
said
simon
again
in
a
tight
voice
the
doge
says
you
are
to
wait
in
quarters
of
your
own
choosing
until
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
are
ready
to
travel
at
that
time
he
will
place
them
in
your
keeping
until
then
you
are
to
trouble
him
no
more
unless
you
are
a
very
good
swimmer
simon
felt
rage
boil
up
within
him
he
clenched
his
fists
and
fought
it
down
tell
him
i
thank
his
serenity
for
his
courtesy
and
will
forever
honor
him
for
it
sordello
nodded
and
there
was
a
look
of
respect
in
his
craggy
face
as
sordello
repeated
simon
words
to
the
sergente
of
the
doge
guards
simon
wheeled
and
strode
back
the
way
he
had
come
to
stare
out
to
sea
tears
of
frustrated
fury
burned
his
eyes
he
could
feel
hot
blood
beating
in
his
temples
the
doge
had
treated
him
like
a
small
boy
that
old
gargoyle
had
insulted
him
had
insulted
the
house
of
gobignon
had
insulted
king
louis
and
there
was
nothing
simon
could
do
about
it
he
felt
furious
and
miserable
a
failure
at
the
very
start
of
his
task
vi
crushed
simon
decided
that
at
least
he
would
quarter
his
french
knights
and
the
venetian
archers
as
near
to
the
doge
palace
as
possible
the
doge
alone
would
be
protecting
the
tartars
for
the
time
being
and
simon
had
no
choice
about
it
with
sordello
help
he
found
lodgings
for
his
men
at
the
outrageous
price
of
two
deniers
a
night
per
man
not
all
the
thieves
were
on
the
highways
at
the
nearest
inn
to
the
piazza
san
marco
just
a
short
distance
down
a
side
street
how
much
of
what
he
paid
the
innkeeper
he
wondered
would
end
up
in
sordello
purse
then
accompanied
by
alain
de
pirenne
he
walked
back
to
the
entrance
gate
to
the
doge
palace
a
long
building
that
stretched
from
the
waterfront
to
the
basilica
he
sent
a
message
in
by
way
of
a
guard
asking
friar
mathieu
to
meet
him
in
the
piazza
the
kindly
franciscan
was
he
suspected
the
most
important
person
in
the
entourage
simon
and
alain
had
taken
off
their
mail
and
were
more
comfortably
dressed
in
silk
tunics
short
capes
and
velvet
caps
each
still
wore
his
weapons
belt
with
longsword
hung
on
the
left
and
dagger
on
the
right
the
leather
heels
of
their
boots
rang
on
the
stones
of
the
piazza
as
they
paced
waiting
to
see
if
friar
mathieu
would
come
out
alain
was
still
indignant
they
have
no
idea
who
you
are
simon
why
you
could
take
this
whole
city
and
set
it
in
one
corner
of
the
gobignon
domain
and
it
would
never
be
noticed
normally
ruddy
alain
was
even
redder
with
anger
his
blond
mustache
bristled
much
as
paris
goes
unnoticed
in
the
midst
of
the
île
de
simon
thought
with
a
smile
now
that
his
armor
was
off
and
an
hour
or
more
had
passed
simon
felt
more
at
ease
and
was
inclined
to
accept
the
situation
after
all
if
he
could
not
get
into
the
doge
palace
he
might
reasonably
hope
that
neither
could
anyone
who
would
want
to
harm
the
tartars
it
is
wealth
and
ships
that
make
this
city
great
alain
not
its
size
that
is
all
these
venetians
care
about
money
like
any
proper
knight
alain
despised
money
and
those
who
loved
it
in
the
course
of
learning
to
manage
his
estate
simon
had
acquired
more
respect
for
money
even
paris
has
no
beauty
to
rival
this
said
simon
feeling
a
shade
disloyal
even
as
he
said
so
look
at
those
horses
he
pointed
to
the
façade
above
the
central
doorway
of
the
cathedral
of
san
marco
where
four
gilded
bronze
horses
pranced
so
proud
and
energetic
as
to
seem
almost
in
motion
alain
whistled
in
appreciation
what
wizard
wrought
them
i
wonder
simon
who
had
been
asking
questions
in
the
week
they
had
been
there
said
they
come
from
constantinople
about
sixty
years
ago
the
venetians
paid
an
army
of
french
crusaders
our
forefathers
to
turn
aside
from
the
holy
land
and
conquer
constantinople
instead
the
venetians
took
those
horses
and
set
them
here
to
proclaim
their
triumph
diverting
a
crusade
is
surely
a
great
sin
said
alain
and
theft
is
theft
but
none
of
my
forefathers
had
anything
to
do
with
the
foul
deed
you
tell
of
no
nor
mine
said
simon
the
french
knights
who
conquered
constantinople
were
our
forefathers
only
in
a
manner
of
speaking
my
predecessor
count
amalric
de
gobignon
did
fouler
things
by
far
as
alain
well
knows
though
he
is
too
good
a
friend
to
mention
still
the
good
taste
of
the
venetians
is
admirable
simon
said
aloud
still
gazing
at
the
horses
for
all
i
know
this
could
be
the
richest
city
in
the
world
said
alain
missing
the
point
but
what
matter
simon
if
its
riches
are
stolen
goods
venice
is
by
no
means
the
richest
city
in
the
world
messire
someone
beside
them
said
startled
simon
turned
to
see
friar
mathieu
who
had
fallen
into
step
with
them
his
eyes
warm
and
friendly
simon
wanted
to
throw
his
arms
around
the
old
man
and
hug
him
there
are
cities
in
the
far
east
so
big
and
so
rich
they
make
venice
look
like
a
fishing
village
friar
mathieu
went
on
his
long
white
beard
blowing
gently
in
the
breeze
from
the
waterfront
people
love
to
tell
wild
stories
about
the
east
said
alain
skeptically
i
heard
of
cities
of
solid
gold
birds
as
big
as
an
elephant
and
so
on
and
on
this
man
has
been
there
simon
wanted
to
shout
much
though
he
liked
alain
simon
was
discovering
in
his
friend
a
narrowness
that
made
him
a
frustrating
traveling
companion
with
alain
here
the
conversation
with
friar
mathieu
would
plod
and
simon
wanted
it
to
gallop
sire
alain
he
said
i
fear
our
hired
may
get
into
trouble
drinking
fighting
and
wenching
unless
someone
keeps
a
sharp
eye
on
them
will
you
see
to
them
please
de
pirenne
held
up
a
broad
hand
i
will
slap
them
down
for
you
if
need
be
monseigneur
now
that
a
third
party
was
present
he
addressed
simon
formally
travel
is
said
to
open
a
man
mind
said
friar
mathieu
when
de
pirenne
was
gone
but
some
minds
are
like
country
châteaus
let
anything
strange
approach
and
the
doors
and
windows
slam
shut
he
took
simon
arm
and
steered
him
over
the
flagstones
of
the
piazza
toward
the
cathedral
the
façade
of
pink
white
and
green
marble
sculptures
and
mosaics
filling
the
spaces
between
them
took
simon
breath
away
there
was
an
opulence
to
the
five
great
domes
that
seemed
to
simon
to
speak
of
the
storied
wealth
of
the
east
they
were
so
different
from
the
pointed
spires
of
the
cathedrals
newly
built
in
france
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
simon
for
trying
so
hard
to
protect
us
today
friar
mathieu
said
the
doge
discourtesy
to
you
was
the
worst
kind
of
rudeness
the
rudeness
of
one
who
thinks
himself
more
refined
than
all
others
simon
felt
better
but
he
wondered
if
the
friar
was
speaking
so
only
out
of
kindness
to
him
it
is
good
of
you
to
reassure
me
he
said
but
the
doge
seems
to
be
guarding
the
ambassadors
well
enough
all
show
said
friar
mathieu
the
venetians
are
not
alert
enough
the
doge
has
no
idea
that
we
are
in
any
danger
nor
does
he
seem
to
care
i
believe
he
has
not
decided
whether
he
has
anything
to
gain
from
an
alliance
between
christians
and
tartars
after
all
the
venetians
trade
quite
happily
with
the
muslims
these
days
simon
was
shocked
is
that
not
a
sin
against
god
perhaps
but
not
against
profit
and
the
common
heading
on
your
venetian
merchant
account
book
is
god
and
profit
young
seigneur
de
gobignon
you
do
not
know
how
happy
i
am
to
talk
to
a
frenchman
again
after
so
many
years
how
long
have
you
been
among
the
tartars
friar
mathieu
the
old
franciscan
sighed
long
enough
to
learn
the
eastern
way
of
counting
the
years
in
cycles
they
give
each
year
the
name
of
a
certain
animal
a
strange
system
a
sensible
system
it
is
easier
to
remember
beasts
than
numbers
let
me
see
this
year
anno
domini
they
call
the
year
of
the
sheep
and
when
i
first
entered
the
camp
of
hulagu
khan
the
tartars
told
me
it
was
the
year
of
the
dragon
from
dragon
to
sheep
there
are
he
counted
on
his
fingers
while
muttering
the
names
of
beasts
under
his
breath
seven
animals
so
seven
years
since
our
good
king
louis
sent
me
to
bear
his
messages
to
the
tartars
then
you
went
in
anno
domini
that
is
right
simon
wanted
very
much
to
know
more
about
life
among
the
tartars
but
he
and
the
old
friar
could
have
long
talks
on
the
road
to
orvieto
for
now
there
were
more
pressing
questions
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
the
friar
pointed
to
the
gateway
between
the
basilica
and
the
doge
palace
there
go
the
armenians
simon
saw
six
of
the
swarthy
men
crossing
the
piazza
in
a
line
though
they
were
there
was
a
swagger
in
the
way
they
walked
they
had
doffed
their
leather
armor
and
wore
tunics
of
white
silk
with
billowing
red
trousers
over
short
black
boots
their
tunics
were
cinched
at
the
waist
with
black
leather
belts
and
in
each
belt
was
thrust
a
curving
saber
in
a
jeweled
scabbard
their
bows
were
slung
across
their
backs
along
with
black
leather
quivers
four
of
them
stayed
behind
to
guard
the
tartars
friar
mathieu
said
simon
had
been
wondering
just
how
his
knights
and
archers
would
share
with
the
armenian
guards
the
responsibility
of
protecting
the
tartars
why
did
the
ambassadors
bring
armenians
and
not
their
own
tartar
warriors
he
asked
friar
mathieu
because
the
armenians
are
christians
and
are
more
like
europeans
than
themselves
the
armenians
are
allies
not
subjects
of
the
tartars
these
ten
who
travel
with
us
are
great
men
among
the
armenian
people
one
of
them
hethum
is
in
line
to
be
king
of
armenia
some
day
one
feels
safer
traveling
with
such
men
simon
watched
the
armenians
disappear
down
a
narrow
side
street
leading
off
the
piazza
he
felt
a
twinge
of
worry
seeing
that
they
were
heading
toward
the
street
in
which
his
own
men
were
quartered
he
wanted
to
follow
after
the
men
from
the
east
but
he
did
not
want
to
interrupt
his
conversation
with
friar
mathieu
feeling
pulled
in
two
directions
he
held
himself
to
the
friar
slow
thoughtful
pace
as
they
approached
the
cathedral
even
some
tartars
are
christians
i
have
heard
simon
said
there
are
many
religions
among
the
tartars
they
had
reached
the
front
of
san
marco
and
friar
mathieu
still
holding
simon
arm
wheeled
them
around
and
started
them
walking
back
toward
the
doge
palace
hulagu
khan
wife
the
khatun
is
a
christian
although
he
is
a
pagan
but
what
all
tartars
really
worship
is
strength
in
their
own
language
they
call
themselves
which
means
strong
simon
looked
at
the
friar
and
saw
a
faraway
look
in
those
old
eyes
one
wonders
why
god
created
them
to
punish
us
for
our
sins
or
to
rule
the
world
and
to
bring
order
to
all
mankind
rule
the
world
said
simon
he
thought
about
the
two
men
in
silk
robes
he
had
seen
disembarking
from
the
galley
a
few
hours
before
he
remembered
the
look
the
older
tartar
had
given
him
so
unfeeling
as
if
looking
down
upon
him
from
a
vast
distance
they
think
it
is
their
destiny
to
rule
the
world
said
friar
mathieu
and
it
is
not
a
foolish
dream
they
have
already
conquered
much
of
it
you
might
sneer
at
me
as
your
skeptical
knight
did
monseigneur
if
i
told
you
how
vast
the
tartar
empire
is
take
france
england
and
the
holy
roman
empire
together
and
they
would
be
swallowed
up
in
the
lands
ruled
by
the
tartars
please
call
me
simon
father
if
you
will
it
embarrasses
me
to
be
addressed
as
monseigneur
by
one
such
as
you
friar
mathieu
patted
simon
hand
very
well
simon
that
is
kindly
spoken
it
will
be
good
for
us
to
be
friends
because
we
have
a
very
difficult
and
doubtful
mission
why
doubtful
we
can
not
be
sure
we
are
doing
the
right
thing
these
two
men
john
and
philip
command
great
armies
in
the
tartar
empire
watch
them
simon
notice
how
they
observe
fortifications
and
weapons
the
same
monks
who
made
christians
of
them
also
taught
them
how
to
write
many
times
at
day
end
in
syria
and
on
cyprus
i
have
seen
them
talking
together
making
notes
drawing
maps
whether
they
form
this
alliance
or
not
they
will
have
much
useful
knowledge
to
bring
back
to
their
khan
might
it
not
be
better
for
all
of
us
if
i
fail
to
protect
the
tartars
and
some
enemy
of
christendom
succeeds
in
killing
them
simon
felt
an
aching
tightness
in
his
forehead
he
desperately
wanted
the
alliance
to
succeed
and
thereby
show
the
nobility
of
france
that
neither
he
nor
his
family
any
longer
deserved
their
scorn
if
the
alliance
failed
he
failed
and
the
house
of
gobignon
would
sink
deeper
into
dishonor
let
others
worry
he
decided
about
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
protect
the
tartars
monseigneur
there
was
urgency
in
the
voice
that
hailed
simon
from
across
the
square
and
a
feeling
of
dread
came
over
him
he
turned
to
see
his
equerry
thierry
his
wavy
black
hair
uncovered
running
across
the
piazza
they
are
fighting
monseigneur
thierry
panted
our
venetian
archers
and
those
men
from
tartary
you
best
come
at
once
jesus
save
us
simon
heard
friar
mathieu
whisper
beside
him
staring
into
thierry
anxious
eyes
simon
felt
himself
getting
angry
six
knights
he
had
brought
with
him
any
knight
worthy
of
his
spurs
should
be
able
to
stop
any
pack
of
commoners
from
fighting
and
if
they
could
not
he
thought
with
a
sudden
shift
from
anger
to
anxiety
what
more
could
he
do
there
was
no
time
to
think
father
will
you
come
please
he
said
to
mathieu
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
struck
thierry
on
the
shoulder
and
began
to
run
with
him
i
follow
as
quickly
as
i
can
my
son
he
heard
from
behind
him
could
you
not
stop
them
he
demanded
of
thierry
as
they
headed
down
a
narrow
cobblestoned
street
at
a
dead
run
dread
made
his
legs
heavy
de
puys
a
veteran
of
the
last
crusade
de
pirenne
a
strong
and
knight
had
sent
for
for
simon
de
gobignon
twenty
years
of
age
who
had
never
in
his
life
been
in
a
battle
breath
of
god
what
did
they
expect
of
him
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
without
killing
the
tartars
bodyguard
said
thierry
you
will
see
how
it
is
when
you
get
there
the
inn
was
a
stone
building
with
houses
on
either
side
the
lower
half
of
the
divided
door
was
shut
but
the
upper
half
was
open
and
simon
heard
shouts
from
within
thierry
ahead
of
him
yanked
the
door
open
for
him
it
took
his
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust
to
the
darkness
of
the
large
room
shadowy
figures
jostled
him
as
he
pushed
his
way
through
a
little
light
came
from
the
grilled
windows
and
from
a
single
huge
yellow
candle
burning
in
a
candlestick
on
a
table
the
room
reeked
of
sweaty
bodies
and
old
wine
make
way
for
monseigneur
le
comte
thierry
called
uselessly
as
the
venetian
mercenaries
jabbered
angrily
in
italian
simon
pushed
his
way
into
the
corner
of
the
room
lit
by
the
candle
and
found
himself
facing
a
scowling
man
pointing
a
gleaming
sword
at
him
five
of
the
armenians
sabers
out
had
formed
a
protective
ring
within
the
ring
the
sixth
armenian
had
a
man
bent
forward
over
a
table
the
man
arms
flailed
feebly
and
his
eyes
bulged
even
in
the
poor
light
simon
could
see
that
his
face
turned
on
its
side
toward
him
was
purple
the
armenian
was
holding
his
bow
behind
the
man
neck
and
was
turning
it
slowly
now
simon
saw
the
string
cutting
into
the
neck
it
hurt
simon
to
look
at
what
was
happening
he
felt
his
own
breath
cut
off
his
heart
pounding
as
if
he
were
laboring
for
air
he
wanted
to
turn
away
and
knew
he
could
not
he
must
somehow
stop
this
before
that
venetian
died
blood
of
god
he
whispered
he
recognized
the
darkened
distorted
face
sordello
all
around
simon
the
venetians
were
edging
closer
to
the
armenians
their
daggers
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
but
none
of
the
foot
soldiers
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
brave
those
sabers
that
meant
simon
thought
heart
pounding
that
he
would
have
to
face
them
the
devil
are
my
knights
looking
to
the
right
and
left
simon
saw
alain
henri
de
puys
and
the
four
others
swords
out
but
like
himself
unarmored
standing
irresolutely
between
the
venetians
and
the
armenians
against
one
wall
he
saw
a
huddle
of
women
their
bare
bosoms
gleaming
in
the
dim
light
standing
protectively
in
front
of
the
women
was
a
man
simon
recognized
as
the
innkeeper
for
the
price
simon
was
paying
why
could
not
this
man
keep
order
in
his
own
house
aha
now
we
have
the
stinking
figlii
di
cagne
a
man
behind
simon
cried
simon
turned
and
saw
a
crossbow
leveled
at
shoulder
height
he
had
ordered
that
the
venetians
weapons
be
kept
under
lock
and
key
evidently
someone
had
broken
them
out
once
the
rest
of
the
venetians
armed
themselves
with
their
bows
the
armenians
would
be
slaughtered
simon
body
grew
hot
with
anger
he
would
like
to
kill
the
fool
who
helped
the
venetians
to
their
arms
but
the
armenians
had
their
bows
too
and
one
by
one
they
started
to
unsling
them
simon
heard
the
ominous
squeaking
as
the
venetians
wound
back
their
crossbow
strings
the
armenians
would
never
be
able
to
get
their
arrows
nocked
and
their
bows
drawn
before
the
crossbow
bolts
began
to
fly
simon
actions
followed
instantly
on
his
thoughts
cessi
he
shouted
hoping
the
venetians
would
understand
him
now
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
him
the
muscles
of
his
belly
tightened
as
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
the
right
thing
to
do
the
hands
of
the
venetians
hesitated
on
their
crossbows
as
they
recognized
their
master
de
pirenne
de
puys
the
rest
of
you
make
our
men
put
down
their
crossbows
but
just
as
simon
spoke
the
armenian
strangling
sordello
gave
another
turn
to
his
bow
and
the
old
bravo
gagged
and
gasped
simon
realized
that
if
he
drew
his
scimitar
the
room
would
be
a
charnel
house
in
moments
he
approached
the
armenian
nearest
him
spreading
his
hands
to
show
their
emptiness
he
prayed
that
the
man
whose
bow
and
arrow
was
aimed
at
his
chest
would
not
see
how
those
outstretched
hands
were
trembling
in
his
strongest
voice
he
said
hold
your
arrow
hoping
the
man
would
understand
his
tone
as
he
spoke
he
firmly
grasped
the
arrow
near
its
head
and
pushed
it
aside
his
heart
thudded
and
he
could
almost
feel
that
steel
tip
stabbing
into
his
chest
and
how
bare
was
his
back
to
the
crossbow
quarrels
the
armenian
took
a
step
to
the
side
and
let
simon
pass
simon
let
out
a
deep
breath
of
relief
as
he
stepped
forward
the
soles
of
his
boots
slid
a
little
the
floor
he
realized
must
be
slippery
with
spilled
wine
now
he
was
facing
the
man
who
was
murdering
sordello
a
vagrant
thought
struck
simon
do
not
like
sordello
i
would
not
mind
if
the
armenian
killed
him
why
risk
my
life
for
him
a
good
seigneur
is
loyal
to
his
the
answer
came
at
once
he
spoke
commandingly
but
softly
stop
this
is
my
man
and
you
must
not
kill
him
let
him
go
he
put
his
hand
firmly
on
the
forearm
of
the
armenian
who
was
a
good
deal
shorter
than
he
was
the
man
dark
brows
drew
together
in
a
puzzled
frown
he
was
studying
simon
face
simon
could
feel
a
faint
tremor
in
the
muscles
under
his
hand
any
man
would
be
frightened
at
a
moment
like
this
no
matter
how
brave
how
hardened
simon
thought
but
he
saw
that
the
armenian
face
was
unlined
his
eyes
clear
his
black
mustache
was
small
and
fine
must
be
about
my
age
maybe
even
simon
felt
a
warmth
toward
the
young
armenian
and
hoped
he
could
win
him
over
but
how
could
such
a
fellow
bring
himself
to
strangle
a
man
with
a
bowstring
perhaps
sordello
had
done
something
truly
evil
come
now
simon
said
giving
the
young
man
arm
a
gentle
shake
do
let
him
go
he
essayed
a
smile
hoping
it
would
look
friendly
the
armenian
let
out
a
deep
sigh
and
closed
his
eyes
then
he
released
his
grip
on
the
bow
he
slapped
it
with
one
hand
to
make
it
twirl
simon
heard
a
faint
choking
sound
from
sordello
and
then
the
italian
slid
to
the
stone
floor
a
woman
her
hair
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
rushed
to
the
young
armenian
and
held
his
arm
talking
soothingly
in
italian
he
stiffened
at
first
then
smiled
at
her
thank
you
said
simon
to
the
armenian
shaky
with
relief
he
smiled
and
patted
the
dark
man
free
arm
feeling
foolish
about
his
simple
words
of
gratitude
if
only
friar
mathieu
would
get
here
so
that
he
could
talk
to
these
men
from
the
east
a
cool
feeling
of
relief
bathed
simon
so
far
all
had
gone
amazingly
well
but
he
reminded
himself
this
was
not
over
yet
he
must
continue
to
think
quickly
de
puys
clear
the
venetians
out
of
here
assemble
them
outside
then
march
them
away
from
this
street
altogether
and
collect
their
crossbows
and
get
them
locked
up
again
you
should
never
have
let
them
get
at
those
weapons
de
pirenne
you
stay
here
and
tell
me
what
happened
well
this
is
how
it
was
monseigneur
said
alain
looking
abashed
our
men
were
drinking
quietly
and
this
redheaded
woman
was
sitting
with
sordello
then
these
men
from
tartary
came
in
they
made
no
trouble
just
sat
down
in
their
own
corner
but
the
woman
she
took
a
fancy
to
that
man
you
saw
trying
to
kill
sordello
she
served
him
wine
and
sat
down
with
him
sordello
went
over
and
tried
to
get
her
back
there
were
words
they
did
understand
each
other
but
the
meaning
was
clear
sordello
went
for
the
other
with
a
knife
and
then
the
other
man
it
out
of
his
hand
rather
a
surprise
that
was
to
sordello
too
i
think
and
the
next
thing
i
know
he
was
strangling
sordello
and
his
companions
would
not
let
anyone
stop
it
sordello
had
the
key
to
the
storeroom
where
the
crossbows
were
kept
after
the
armenian
seized
him
he
threw
it
to
one
of
the
venetians
a
typical
muddle
simon
thought
like
most
of
the
cases
brought
to
him
for
justice
since
he
had
become
seigneur
of
gobignon
he
felt
disgusted
with
all
these
fools
no
saying
who
was
at
fault
most
likely
the
damned
woman
thank
the
virgin
he
did
not
have
to
fix
blame
just
put
a
stop
to
the
fighting
sordello
who
had
been
lying
curled
up
on
the
floor
suddenly
lashed
out
with
a
booted
foot
the
woman
screamed
as
simon
stared
the
young
armenian
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
sordello
sprang
upon
him
and
a
dagger
flashed
he
was
striking
at
the
armenian
chest
simon
had
no
time
to
feel
the
panic
that
flooded
through
him
he
grabbed
for
sordello
arm
too
late
to
stop
the
dagger
but
pulling
it
back
so
that
it
drove
upward
through
the
muscles
of
the
chest
instead
of
plunging
deep
the
armenian
bellowed
in
pain
with
all
his
strength
simon
yanked
sordello
off
the
armenian
and
threw
him
backward
de
pirenne
caught
him
and
held
him
shouting
in
their
own
language
and
brandishing
their
swords
the
other
armenians
rushed
at
sordello
a
familiar
voice
cried
out
a
sentence
in
a
strange
tongue
friar
mathieu
rushed
into
the
circle
of
candlelight
his
white
beard
flying
his
arms
upraised
at
his
sudden
appearance
the
armenians
who
were
ready
to
make
mincemeat
of
sordello
and
perhaps
de
pirenne
with
him
hesitated
thank
god
the
weight
of
struggling
to
control
this
dreadful
situation
was
no
longer
simon
alone
to
bear
friar
mathieu
spoke
several
sentences
to
the
armenians
simon
could
not
tell
from
his
tone
whether
he
was
scolding
them
or
trying
to
placate
them
there
were
in
the
room
five
angry
men
who
looked
to
be
formidable
fighters
armed
with
swords
and
bows
and
arrows
and
simon
realized
he
had
just
sent
away
all
but
one
of
his
knights
and
all
of
his
crossbowmen
simon
cursed
himself
for
letting
sordello
wound
the
young
man
said
sordello
dropped
a
dagger
why
did
i
not
think
to
look
for
it
he
felt
himself
growing
hot
and
cold
as
he
realized
this
incident
might
wreck
everything
for
christendom
for
louis
and
for
the
honor
of
the
house
of
gobignon
now
friar
mathieu
fell
to
his
knees
beside
the
young
armenian
whose
white
tunic
was
splashed
deep
scarlet
with
blood
he
spoke
comforting
words
to
him
and
then
turned
an
agonized
face
to
simon
this
is
prince
hethum
said
the
friar
the
tartars
will
be
furious
when
they
learn
what
has
happened
this
may
destroy
any
chance
of
an
alliance
at
the
very
least
they
will
demand
satisfaction
am
to
protect
these
emissaries
and
one
of
my
own
men
has
stabbed
a
prince
of
despair
was
an
ache
in
simon
chest
what
sort
of
satisfaction
i
fear
they
will
require
that
man
life
said
friar
mathieu
sadly
by
god
beard
i
have
done
no
wrong
sordello
rasped
his
voice
was
a
croak
be
silent
simon
snapped
his
rage
against
himself
turning
to
fury
at
sordello
you
are
a
fool
but
being
a
fool
will
not
save
you
your
signory
sordello
cried
how
could
i
let
him
take
the
woman
from
me
my
honor
honor
simon
raged
what
is
your
wandering
blackguard
honor
compared
to
the
honor
of
france
the

him
over
you
look
at
her
sordello
glared
at
simon
but
was
silent
the
woman
crouched
over
the
fallen
prince
hethum
crooning
softly
in
italian
yet
uncle
charles
would
not
want
me
to
sacrifice
sordello
and
the
armenian
did
try
to
kill
him
my
knights
and
will
lose
all
respect
for
me
if
i
let
the
tartars
have
their
way
with
if
he
goes
unpunished
if
the
armenian
prince
goes
unrevenged
there
will
be
no
alliance
at
and
it
would
be
his
fault
the
little
honor
that
was
left
to
the
house
of
gobignon
would
be
lost
a
wave
of
anger
at
himself
swept
over
him
had
he
dedicated
himself
to
the
alliance
only
so
that
he
might
free
himself
from
the
agony
of
his
guilty
secret
and
his
house
from
dishonor
he
thought
of
king
louis
and
how
pure
was
his
desire
to
win
back
for
christendom
the
places
where
christ
had
lived
how
impure
were
simon
own
motives
as
long
as
he
put
his
own
needs
first
he
would
continue
to
deserve
the
burdens
of
guilt
and
shame
vii
in
the
name
of
god
the
beneficent
the
merciful
all
praise
be
to
god
lord
of
the
worlds
master
of
the
day
of
judgment
daoud
stood
perfectly
still
looking
into
the
violet
sky
reciting
in
his
mind
the
salat
the
prayer
required
of
a
muslim
five
times
daily
this
was
mughrab
the
moment
when
the
last
light
of
sunset
had
drained
away
an
evening
breeze
cooled
his
face
welcome
after
a
day
of
traveling
under
the
summer
sky
of
italy
oriented
by
a
bright
crescent
moon
just
rising
he
faced
southeast
toward
mecca
his
back
was
to
the
stone
wall
of
the
inn
called
the
capo
di
bue
the
ox
head
where
he
and
sophia
and
celino
had
decided
to
spend
the
night
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
loud
voices
contended
for
attention
the
sound
of
travelers
in
the
common
room
settling
down
to
supper
praying
in
the
dusk
reminded
daoud
that
he
was
alone
what
would
it
be
like
now
in
el
kahira
the
guarded
one
he
would
be
praying
with
hundreds
of
fellow
muslimin
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
all
equal
before
god
in
the
gray
mosque
all
listening
to
the
call
of
the
blind
muezzins
from
the
minarets
come
to
the
house
of
praise
god
is
almighty
there
is
no
god
but
god
all
facing
the
prophet
birthplace
together
in
holy
submission
daoud
prayer
might
be
the
only
one
going
up
to
god
tonight
from
anywhere
near
rome
all
around
him
towered
ruins
the
silhouettes
of
broken
columns
rose
against
the
darkening
sky
and
across
the
appian
way
the
ragged
shape
of
what
had
once
been
a
wall
pines
stood
tall
and
black
where
according
to
lorenzo
some
wealthy
woman
of
ancient
rome
had
her
tomb
he
tried
to
forget
his
surroundings
and
to
think
only
of
the
salat
it
was
hard
to
concentrate
when
he
could
not
assume
the
proper
positions
for
prayer
raise
his
hands
kneel
strike
his
forehead
on
the
ground
he
fixed
his
mind
on
the
infinity
of
god
do
not
try
to
see
him
abu
hamid
saadi
had
told
him
if
you
see
him
in
your
mind
you
are
looking
at
an
idol
daoud
did
not
try
to
see
god
but
as
he
prayed
a
muslim
all
alone
in
the
heart
of
christendom
he
could
not
help
but
see
sheikh
saadi
the
sufi
master
who
had
brought
him
to
islam
the
face
was
very
dark
the
rich
black
of
a
cup
of
kaviyeh
out
of
the
blackness
peered
eyes
that
saw
into
the
very
souls
of
his
students
often
as
he
sat
listening
to
sheikh
saadi
read
from
the
koran
the
book
to
be
read
and
explain
its
meaning
voices
from
the
past
reproached
him
the
voice
of
father
adrian
the
chaplain
of
their
castle
rang
in
his
mind
the
quiet
voice
of
his
mother
teaching
him
the
lord
prayer
and
the
hail
mary
whispered
to
him
like
thunder
his
father
spoke
of
war
and
of
what
it
was
to
be
a
knight
he
could
escape
the
torment
of
these
voices
only
by
listening
closely
to
the
sufi
sheikh
saadi
was
trying
to
teach
him
how
to
be
good
and
that
was
the
same
thing
his
mother
and
father
had
wanted
for
him
so
they
would
not
mind
if
he
learned
from
saadi
sheikh
saadi
wearing
the
white
woolen
robe
of
a
sufi
sat
on
a
carpet
of
mosul
an
open
copy
of
the
koran
resting
on
an
ornately
carved
lectern
before
him
his
hand
as
dark
as
the
mahogany
of
the
stand
caressed
the
page
as
he
read
aloud
as
persevere
in
seeking
their
lord
countenance
and
are
regular
in
prayer
and
spend
of
that
which
we
bestow
upon
them
secretly
and
openly
and
overcome
evil
with
good
theirs
will
be
the
heavenly
home
dogs
daoud
remembered
father
adrian
in
his
black
and
white
robes
shouting
in
the
chapel
at
château
langmuir
is
the
author
of
that
vile
book
they
call
the
by
the
age
of
eleven
daoud
had
already
known
cruelty
and
evil
at
the
hands
of
the
turks
who
had
captured
him
kindness
with
baibars
and
goodness
with
sheikh
saadi
the
sufi
sheikh
had
never
made
any
claim
but
daoud
had
no
doubt
that
he
often
walked
and
talked
with
god
secretly
and
openly
are
we
to
give
the
old
man
was
saying
god
has
been
generous
to
us
and
we
must
be
generous
in
turn
when
you
are
kind
to
a
bird
or
a
donkey
or
even
to
an
unclean
animal
like
a
pig
or
a
dog
he
loves
you
for
it
he
loves
you
more
when
you
are
kind
to
a
slave
or
to
a
woman
or
to
one
of
the
unfortunate
like
a
cripple
or
an
unbeliever
daoud
is
both
a
slave
and
unbeliever
said
gamal
ibn
nasir
with
a
faint
sneer
must
i
be
kind
to
him
daoud
stared
at
gamal
burning
with
hatred
all
the
more
because
what
he
said
was
true
gamal
was
a
slender
boy
whom
no
one
dared
cross
because
he
was
a
grandson
of
the
reigning
sultan
of
egypt
al
salih
ayub
most
of
saadi
students
were
boys
of
noble
family
and
daoud
knew
that
he
was
permitted
to
enter
this
circle
only
because
all
men
feared
and
respected
baibars
and
even
though
he
studied
islam
with
them
because
it
was
baibars
wish
daoud
remained
an
outsider
because
he
was
an
unbeliever
the
boys
sat
in
a
semicircle
their
rectangles
of
carpet
spread
over
the
blue
and
white
tiles
of
the
inner
courtyard
of
the
gray
mosque
where
saadi
had
been
teaching
since
long
before
these
students
were
born
the
old
black
man
sat
with
his
back
to
the
gray
stones
of
the
western
wall
the
stones
that
gave
the
mosque
its
name
he
taught
in
the
late
afternoon
when
he
and
the
boys
could
sit
in
the
shade
god
is
compassion
itself
gamal
sheikh
saadi
said
with
a
smile
but
even
he
may
find
it
hard
to
love
a
mean
spirit
the
sultan
grandson
blushed
angrily
and
his
eyes
fell
thinking
about
the
compassion
of
god
daoud
opened
his
eyes
wide
as
a
startling
idea
occurred
to
him
but
after
the
insult
from
gamal
his
tongue
felt
thick
in
his
throat
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
went
cold
at
the
thought
of
speaking
he
still
stumbled
over
the
arabic
tongue
in
which
sheikh
saadi
conducted
his
lessons
saadi
looked
warmly
upon
him
daoud
has
a
question
daoud
stared
down
at
his
hands
which
seemed
very
large
as
they
lay
in
his
lap
yes
master
those
kindly
eyes
seemed
to
draw
speech
out
of
him
if
god
loves
the
compassionate
how
can
he
look
with
favor
upon
the
warrior
who
wounds
and
kills
saadi
turbaned
head
lifted
his
grizzled
beard
thrust
forward
and
his
eyes
grew
round
and
serious
he
looked
daoud
thought
like
a
thoroughbred
steed
pricking
up
his
ears
to
a
trumpet
call
i
say
to
you
daoud
and
to
gamal
and
to
all
of
you
the
work
of
a
warrior
is
a
holy
calling
when
the
prophet
muhammad
may
god
bless
and
salute
him
began
to
teach
he
did
not
want
the
believers
to
be
men
of
the
sword
but
the
pagans
beat
those
who
went
to
hear
him
and
they
would
not
let
him
teach
and
so
he
learned
that
a
true
man
of
god
must
go
forth
with
the
book
in
one
hand
and
the
sword
in
the
other
daoud
felt
a
warm
pride
in
his
chest
he
was
not
a
despicable
slave
he
would
one
day
be
a
warrior
in
a
way
a
holy
man
like
saadi
who
helped
spread
the
teachings
of
god
i
am
an
he
listened
for
the
frankish
voices
in
his
mind
crying
out
against
the
saracens
against
the
devilish
religion
of
the
one
they
called
mahound
but
the
voices
were
silent
a
pale
boy
with
a
grave
face
asked
if
god
made
man
how
can
he
love
one
who
butchers
his
creatures
sheikh
saadi
raised
an
admonishing
finger
the
warrior
of
god
is
no
butcher
he
strikes
with
sorrow
and
compassion
he
hates
evil
but
he
loves
his
fellow
men
even
the
one
he
fights
against
the
warrior
of
god
is
known
not
by
his
willingness
to
kill
but
by
his
willingness
to
die
he
is
a
man
who
would
give
his
life
for
his
friends
saadi
went
on
to
speak
of
other
things
but
daoud
mind
remained
fixed
on
the
words
warrior
of
god
ever
since
the
day
the
saracens
carried
him
off
he
had
lived
without
a
home
he
had
drunk
from
gold
cups
in
the
palace
of
baibars
had
seen
that
a
mameluke
might
rise
to
earthly
glory
but
such
rewards
fell
to
only
one
in
a
thousand
for
the
rank
and
file
the
life
of
a
mameluke
was
a
hard
one
often
ending
in
early
death
lately
baibars
had
sent
him
to
live
with
the
other
mameluke
boys
in
training
on
the
island
of
raudha
in
the
bhar
the
river
nile
every
morning
when
he
woke
to
the
rapping
of
the
drill
master
stick
on
the
wooden
wall
of
his
sleeping
shed
his
first
feeling
was
anguish
sometimes
he
prayed
before
sleeping
that
he
might
not
wake
up
again
only
when
he
journeyed
twice
a
week
by
boat
and
on
foot
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
saadi
did
he
feel
any
peace
but
what
if
god
had
chosen
him
to
be
a
mameluke
then
it
was
a
blessed
life
a
holy
calling
as
saadi
had
said
there
was
a
world
beyond
this
one
a
place
the
koran
called
a
heavenly
home
all
men
christian
and
muslim
believed
that
as
a
warrior
he
could
hope
that
his
hardship
would
be
turned
to
joy
in
that
heavenly
home
in
that
world
not
one
in
ten
thousand
but
every
good
man
would
dwell
in
a
palace
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
heard
the
soft
deep
voice
of
saadi
as
one
hears
the
constant
murmur
of
the
windblown
sand
in
the
desert
the
boys
around
him
and
the
men
who
came
and
went
in
the
gray
mosque
all
were
believers
as
a
warrior
of
god
he
could
be
part
of
that
and
not
the
least
part
he
would
no
longer
be
a
stranger
in
this
world
he
would
be
at
home
the
lesson
was
over
the
boys
stood
with
saadi
and
bowed
their
heads
in
prayer
after
the
prayers
they
bowed
again
to
their
teacher
and
alone
or
in
pairs
pattered
out
of
the
courtyard
of
the
gray
mosque
when
they
were
all
gone
daoud
stood
alone
facing
saadi
what
does
daoud
have
to
say
to
me
in
a
rush
of
love
for
his
master
daoud
threw
himself
to
his
knees
and
struck
his
forehead
on
saadi
red
carpet
bumping
his
head
hard
enough
to
be
slightly
stunned
what
is
it
daoud
saadi
voice
was
a
comforting
rumble
daoud
sat
back
and
looked
up
the
figure
of
the
sufi
towered
over
him
but
saadi
bent
his
head
and
looking
into
the
dark
face
daoud
felt
as
if
someone
huge
and
powerful
had
taken
him
into
his
arms
master
i
want
to
embrace
islam
daoud
was
mentally
repeating
the
salat
for
the
third
time
when
he
heard
footsteps
and
the
click
of
hooves
coming
up
the
road
he
shut
his
eyes
to
resist
the
distraction
a
voice
interrupted
the
fourth
repetition
peace
be
unto
you
signore
can
you
tell
me
if
there
is
room
at
the
sign
of
the
capo
di
bue
for
my
son
and
me
and
our
donkey
daoud
was
annoyed
at
having
to
stop
his
prayers
but
he
had
to
reply
or
call
unwanted
attention
to
himself
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
in
the
shadows
before
him
a
short
man
with
a
full
white
beard
holding
the
reins
of
a
donkey
that
breathed
heavily
and
shifted
its
feet
nervously
on
the
great
black
paving
stones
of
the
appian
way
a
second
figure
obscure
in
the
darkness
sat
on
the
donkey
the
two
seemed
heavily
dressed
for
summer
the
bearded
man
wore
a
round
black
hat
with
a
narrow
brim
of
a
type
daoud
had
never
seen
before
it
is
not
overly
full
he
said
impatiently
but
the
man
with
the
black
hat
still
stood
before
him
are
you
sure
that
we
will
be
welcome
signore
you
can
pay
for
a
place
in
the
common
bed
can
you
not
said
daoud
eager
to
finish
the
prayer
oh
we
do
not
require
a
bed
signore
said
the
old
man
we
will
sleep
in
the
stable
or
sit
up
he
chuckled
or
even
sleep
standing
up
as
our
donkey
does
it
is
just
that
we
can
not
go
farther
tonight
rome
has
more
robbers
than
a
dog
has
fleas
why
in
the
name
of
god
was
the
man
so
hesitant
daoud
seeing
no
need
to
continue
the
conversation
remained
silent
the
old
man
sighed
peace
be
to
you
signore
he
said
again
come
my
son
the
man
son
climbed
down
and
the
two
travelers
pulled
the
donkey
through
the
inn
gate
leather
packs
hung
from
either
side
of
the
donkey
and
daoud
wondered
what
was
in
them
probably
nothing
of
value
but
robbers
would
attack
anyone
who
looked
vulnerable
and
the
old
fear
was
doubtless
justified
daoud
thought
of
the
precious
stones
he
and
celino
carried
between
them
he
felt
the
cold
breath
of
danger
on
the
back
of
his
neck
in
this
inn
they
may
all
be
honest
men
but
if
they
knew
what
wealth
we
had
even
honest
men
would
try
to
cut
our
he
turned
his
mind
again
to
his
prayers
by
the
time
he
finished
and
turned
to
go
through
the
gate
leading
to
the
courtyard
he
sensed
a
change
in
the
noises
from
within
shrill
angry
voices
had
replaced
the
cheerful
murmur
of
general
conversation
the
donkey
and
the
boy
who
had
ridden
it
huddled
in
the
corner
where
the
stables
met
the
main
building
daoud
stood
listening
in
the
center
of
the
inn
yard
his
hand
resting
lightly
on
the
dagger
at
his
belt
he
faced
the
main
building
the
dining
hall
at
ground
level
the
beds
that
slept
six
or
more
upstairs
access
to
the
sleeping
room
was
by
way
of
a
flight
of
outside
wooden
stairs
leading
to
a
platform
and
an
upper
door
the
doors
and
the
window
shutters
on
both
levels
were
open
to
let
in
the
cool
night
air
stables
secured
with
half
doors
on
his
left
a
storage
shed
on
his
right
as
daoud
strode
past
the
old
man
son
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
bright
black
eyes
reflecting
the
light
from
oil
lanterns
hung
on
wooden
pegs
set
high
on
either
side
of
the
inn
door
daoud
moved
to
the
doorway
and
as
he
looked
into
the
smoky
candlelit
hall
his
heart
sank
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
in
the
room
were
turned
toward
lorenzo
celino
he
stood
against
the
far
wall
the
long
blade
of
his
sword
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
facing
six
naked
daggers
beside
celino
the
hound
scipio
stood
tail
whipping
from
side
to
side
fangs
bared
growling
softly
fear
of
that
dog
was
keeping
celino
opponents
back
as
much
as
fear
of
his
sword
thought
daoud
the
bearded
old
man
who
had
spoken
to
daoud
was
standing
to
left
and
a
little
behind
him
celino
eyes
flicked
toward
daoud
for
an
instant
and
then
quickly
away
before
anyone
might
notice
that
he
had
looked
toward
the
doorway
daoud
scanned
the
room
for
sophia
she
was
standing
in
the
shadows
almost
invisible
in
a
long
hooded
cloak
no
one
was
threatening
her
one
of
the
men
facing
celino
daoud
recognized
was
the
innkeeper
himself
he
was
a
huge
man
with
broad
rounded
shoulders
and
a
shock
of
thick
black
hair
cut
off
at
the
same
length
all
the
way
around
so
it
looked
like
a
bowl
the
dagger
he
held
was
a
long
murderous
blade
but
his
big
hand
made
it
look
like
a
toy
give
us
the
jew
the
innkeeper
said
to
celino
we
have
no
quarrel
with
you
the
old
man
was
a
jew
how
was
it
daoud
demanded
of
himself
that
these
people
had
known
that
and
he
had
not
you
do
have
a
quarrel
with
me
said
celino
because
i
do
not
care
to
see
you
torment
and
rob
this
old
man
daoud
swore
to
himself
was
this
the
kind
of
madman
manfred
had
yoked
him
with
sworn
to
the
utmost
secrecy
carrying
a
fortune
in
jewels
and
now
he
brings
a
whole
inn
down
around
his
ears
by
defending
some
dusty
old
man
does
not
god
love
the
compassionate
us
the
the
innkeeper
had
said
daoud
knew
that
christians
took
delight
in
mistreating
jews
i
told
the
old
man
to
go
in
there
but
i
did
not
know
he
was
a
jew
or
that
these
people
would
harm
whether
celino
was
a
madman
or
not
daoud
would
have
to
get
him
out
of
this
because
he
was
carrying
half
of
their
supply
of
precious
stones
when
they
left
lucera
daoud
and
celino
had
divided
the
jewels
manfred
had
traded
for
the
great
emerald
each
carried
half
of
the
precious
stones
in
a
pouch
hidden
under
his
tunic
daoud
studied
the
room
there
must
be
a
good
thirty
people
there
most
of
them
men
aside
from
the
six
surrounding
celino
few
of
them
seemed
menacing
but
if
someone
jumped
in
to
help
celino
more
might
join
the
other
side
do
i
have
to
help
me
that
boy
who
came
with
the
old
man
sophia
and
celino
and
the
if
only
he
thought
he
had
the
scorpion
but
that
was
in
the
dining
hall
there
with
all
their
other
baggage
which
celino
the
fool
was
supposed
to
be
guarding
he
backed
out
into
the
small
courtyard
and
bumped
into
the
boy
who
had
followed
him
to
the
door
you
your
father
is
in
danger
in
there
and
my
friend
has
gotten
into
trouble
trying
to
help
him
we
must
get
them
out
you
and
i
why
should
christians
help
us
the
bitter
voice
was
high
the
boy
must
be
very
young
he
was
wrapped
up
like
a
bedouin
his
head
and
face
were
swathed
in
a
dark
cloth
his
body
cloaked
only
those
sparkling
eyes
showed
i
must
help
my
friend
daoud
said
if
he
lives
you
can
ask
him
why
he
chose
to
defend
your
father
are
you
just
going
to
cower
here
what
should
i
do
what
would
make
those
men
leave
celino
alone
long
enough
to
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
standing
outside
the
doorway
with
the
boy
eyes
searched
the
courtyard
again
as
his
mind
tried
to
fit
what
he
saw
into
a
plan
daoud
looked
up
at
the
lanterns
again
fire
was
sure
to
take
men
minds
off
a
fight
take
the
lanterns
and
run
up
those
stairs
throw
them
into
the
bedding
and
get
a
good
fire
going
make
sure
the
floor
is
burning
then
come
back
down
to
me
daoud
took
the
two
lanterns
down
from
their
pegs
and
handed
them
to
the
boy
who
raced
up
the
stairs
that
clung
to
the
outer
wall
of
the
inn
daoud
went
to
the
stable
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
stalls
that
held
their
four
horses
he
dragged
out
the
saddles
and
bridles
and
threw
them
over
the
horses
backs
trained
with
horses
since
boyhood
he
worked
with
practiced
speed
by
the
time
the
boy
was
beside
him
again
he
had
two
of
the
horses
saddled
he
looked
up
and
saw
bright
yellow
flames
flickering
in
the
upper
windows
you
did
that
well
he
said
you
know
how
to
saddle
horses
yes
messere
get
these
two
ready
then
do
it
right
you
will
be
riding
one
and
hold
them
here
with
your
donkey
daoud
turned
and
shouted
fire
he
ran
to
the
doorway
looked
in
long
enough
to
see
the
darkened
spot
with
its
glowing
center
in
the
wooden
ceiling
of
the
dining
hall
and
gestured
toward
it
as
he
again
shouted
fire
then
he
stepped
back
to
let
the
crowd
tumble
out
past
him
the
burly
innkeeper
was
among
the
first
to
exit
jamming
his
dagger
back
into
its
scabbard
and
shouting
for
help
take
water
from
the
horse
trough
get
buckets
pots
anything
waving
his
long
arms
he
towered
over
the
men
milling
around
him
like
a
giant
commanding
an
army
of
dwarves
when
the
first
rush
had
pushed
through
the
doorway
daoud
ran
into
the
dining
hall
he
could
see
the
blackening
circle
spreading
in
the
ceiling
and
flames
licking
around
its
edges
celino
and
the
old
jew
were
still
standing
together
by
the
far
wall
only
three
men
faced
them
now
come
on
daoud
shouted
he
strode
to
the
table
where
they
had
been
sitting
and
grabbed
up
their
packs
stay
where
you
are
a
woman
voice
cried
it
was
the
wife
a
gaunt
woman
nearly
as
tall
as
her
husband
with
bulging
eyes
and
a
face
as
sharp
as
the
carving
knife
she
brandished
an
earthenware
jug
crashed
down
on
her
head
her
eyes
rolled
up
till
only
the
whites
showed
as
she
slumped
to
the
floor
daoud
saw
sophia
behind
her
done
byzantine
scipio
spegni
celino
shouted
with
a
roar
like
a
lion
scipio
leapt
at
the
central
figure
among
the
three
men
confronting
his
master
scipio
prey
screamed
then
stumbled
over
a
bench
and
fell
to
the
floor
on
his
back
the
hound
sprang
onto
his
chest
snarls
of
rage
all
but
drowning
out
his
victim
shrieks
the
other
two
men
their
mouths
gaping
their
eyes
fixed
on
nothing
ran
past
daoud
without
seeing
him
stop
your
dog
daoud
called
to
celino
i
want
no
killing
smoke
spreading
from
above
was
searing
his
nostrils
daoud
celino
and
sophia
followed
by
the
old
man
and
the
dog
made
their
way
to
the
door
daoud
threw
saddlebags
to
celino
and
sophia
men
were
dragging
their
rearing
horses
out
of
the
stables
and
through
the
gate
the
giant
innkeeper
and
other
men
were
racing
up
and
down
the
outside
stairs
which
had
also
begun
to
burn
dumping
buckets
of
water
on
the
fire
men
were
fighting
their
way
through
smoke
and
flame
into
the
bedroom
trying
to
rescue
belongings
they
had
left
there
the
boy
stood
by
their
horses
exactly
where
daoud
had
left
him
bravely
done
daoud
thought
hastily
tying
his
packs
down
daoud
unlaced
one
there
were
two
weapons
inside
a
scorpion
the
miniature
crossbow
of
the
hashishiyya
and
a
crossbow
daoud
chose
the
bigger
one
a
genoese
arbalest
drawn
by
crank
a
present
from
king
manfred
the
quarrels
were
loaded
by
spring
from
a
chamber
within
the
stock
that
could
hold
six
at
a
time
so
that
the
bowman
could
fire
it
as
quickly
as
he
could
draw
it
holding
the
arbalest
with
one
hand
daoud
vaulted
into
the
saddle
celino
and
sophia
were
already
up
the
old
man
had
clambered
onto
their
spare
horse
and
his
son
was
on
the
donkey
should
leave
that
old
man
daoud
thought
angrily
it
not
for
him
i
would
be
sleeping
comfortably
right
started
the
fire
it
was
the
innkeeper
wife
in
the
doorway
her
tall
body
and
long
arms
silhouetted
by
leaping
flames
she
pointed
an
accusing
hand
at
daoud
party
stop
them
the
men
who
had
been
trying
to
put
out
the
fire
were
giving
up
and
they
turned
and
started
for
daoud
and
his
companions
throw
them
into
the
fire
shrieked
the
woman
in
the
doorway
motioning
the
others
toward
the
gate
daoud
turned
his
horse
sideways
and
swung
the
crossbow
in
an
arc
to
cover
the
attackers
the
men
stopped
their
rush
but
the
tall
woman
pushed
her
way
through
them
screaming
curses
her
hulking
husband
joined
her
his
long
arms
reaching
for
daoud
he
looked
able
to
knock
a
horse
to
the
ground
daoud
used
both
hands
to
aim
the
crossbow
at
him
gripping
the
horse
with
his
knees
he
hoped
the
threat
would
be
enough
to
stop
the
man
he
did
not
want
to
shoot
the
innkeeper
if
anyone
were
killed
the
deed
could
follow
them
to
orvieto
as
he
hesitated
the
huge
man
drew
back
his
arm
and
threw
the
dagger
with
the
force
of
a
catapult
daoud
heard
a
thump
and
a
groan
behind
him
daoud
thumb
pressed
the
crossbow
release
and
the
string
snapped
forward
with
a
reverberating
bang
the
innkeeper
bellowed
with
pain
the
cry
dying
away
as
he
collapsed
the
bolt
probably
went
right
through
him
thought
daoud
as
the
man
dying
groan
faded
his
wife
scream
rose
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
him
and
the
other
men
crowded
around
them
blood
of
jesus
pandolfo
the
innkeeper
wife
wailed
jerking
the
reins
with
his
left
hand
daoud
wheeled
the
horse
out
the
gate
help
us
now
they
will
be
after
which
one
of
his
people
had
been
hurt
he
found
himself
in
his
anger
hoping
it
was
celino
the
three
other
horses
and
the
donkey
were
bunched
together
outside
the
gate
on
the
dirt
path
that
led
through
trees
to
the
appian
way
some
of
the
men
from
the
inn
were
out
there
too
but
when
daoud
swung
the
crossbow
in
their
direction
they
backed
into
the
inn
yard
leave
me
here
the
old
man
gasped
i
am
dying
so
it
was
he
the
dagger
had
hit
they
would
have
to
leave
him
daoud
thought
and
his
son
would
insist
on
staying
with
him
and
the
vengeful
crowd
from
the
inn
would
tear
the
two
of
them
to
pieces
all
this
fighting
would
have
been
for
nothing
celino
spurred
his
horse
over
to
where
the
old
man
swayed
in
the
saddle
clutching
his
stomach
sorry
to
hurt
you
but
we
are
not
leaving
you
he
said
he
pulled
the
groaning
wounded
man
across
to
his
own
horse
and
swung
one
of
his
legs
over
so
that
he
was
riding
astride
daoud
saw
blood
black
in
the
faint
light
of
the
crescent
moon
running
out
of
the
old
man
mouth
staining
his
white
beard
can
you
ride
a
horse
celino
barked
at
the
son
yes
the
boy
sobbed
get
up
on
this
one
celino
indicated
the
horse
from
which
he
had
just
dragged
the
old
man
take
your
packs
off
the
donkey
and
put
them
on
this
horse
if
you
want
them
quickly
quickly
leave
the
donkey
daoud
fingered
the
crossbow
as
the
boy
hastily
transferred
himself
and
his
goods
to
the
horse
celino
risks
our
lives
with
his
care
for
these
strangers
damned
infidel
i
am
the
leader
of
this
here
they
come
cried
sophia
waving
swords
and
halberds
god
knew
where
they
had
gotten
them
and
sticks
and
pitchforks
the
crowd
from
the
inn
tumbled
through
the
gate
some
of
them
were
on
horses
ride
shouted
daoud
in
the
voice
he
used
to
command
his
mameluke
troop
he
kicked
his
spurs
into
his
horse
side
and
sent
it
galloping
down
the
road
he
and
celino
had
not
talked
about
which
way
to
flee
but
there
was
really
only
one
direction
they
could
go
north
toward
their
destination
that
he
knew
would
take
them
straight
into
the
heart
of
rome
there
would
be
a
price
to
pay
for
the
blood
they
had
shed
this
night
the
great
salah
had
said
it
never
viii
the
clatter
of
four
horses
hooves
over
the
broken
paving
stones
of
the
appian
way
rang
in
daoud
ears
he
heard
shouts
behind
him
as
the
men
from
the
ox
head
organized
a
pursuit
and
beside
him
the
old
man
held
erect
by
celino
powerful
arm
groaned
again
and
again
as
the
wild
ride
jolted
his
stomach
wound
his
legs
dangled
lifelessly
on
either
side
of
the
horse
daoud
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
the
boy
was
keeping
up
riding
next
to
celino
his
robes
were
hiked
up
and
his
skinny
bare
legs
gleamed
in
the
faint
moonlight
daoud
could
hear
him
sobbing
loudly
in
time
with
his
father
groans
as
the
horses
pounded
onward
glancing
over
at
sophia
on
his
right
he
saw
that
she
was
stiff
in
the
saddle
like
one
not
used
to
riding
and
the
moonlight
showed
her
lips
tight
and
her
jaw
clenched
but
she
rode
hard
and
made
no
complaint
she
sat
astride
wearing
trousers
under
a
divided
skirt
daoud
felt
himself
admiring
her
so
far
the
woman
had
proved
no
burden
celino
had
caused
trouble
but
not
she
glancing
quickly
again
at
her
profile
outlined
by
moonlight
he
realized
with
a
start
that
she
reminded
him
of
a
face
he
had
not
seen
in
many
years
nicetas
she
had
the
same
high
forehead
and
long
straight
nose
her
mouth
was
fuller
but
her
lips
had
the
chiseled
shape
of
nicetas
lips
nicetas
even
amid
this
moment
perils
sorrow
gripped
his
heart
for
the
one
who
was
lost
and
could
never
be
recovered
as
if
she
sensed
him
looking
at
her
sophia
turned
her
face
toward
him
but
this
put
her
face
in
shadow
and
he
could
not
make
out
her
expression
he
shrugged
and
looked
away
he
rode
with
one
hand
holding
the
arbalest
across
the
saddle
in
front
of
him
the
other
on
the
reins
guiding
his
mount
the
horses
manfred
had
given
them
ran
well
aided
a
little
by
the
high
crescent
moon
daoud
tried
to
maneuver
his
small
party
to
skirt
dark
patches
in
the
road
where
there
might
be
holes
in
the
pavement
that
could
trip
them
the
cries
of
the
pursuers
were
louder
and
daoud
heard
hoofbeats
behind
them
he
looked
back
and
saw
a
dark
cluster
of
horsemen
rushing
down
the
road
five
or
six
men
he
guessed
there
could
not
have
been
many
more
horses
than
that
stabled
at
the
inn
he
felt
no
fear
for
himself
the
country
might
be
strange
to
him
but
riding
and
fighting
in
darkness
were
not
but
his
stomach
tensed
with
worry
about
the
four
people
with
him
one
of
them
was
already
badly
hurt
could
he
get
them
away
safely
they
were
in
his
care
now
and
it
was
a
duty
celino
was
the
only
one
of
his
charges
who
could
look
out
for
himself
and
he
thought
daoud
angrily
was
the
one
who
had
least
deserved
to
survive
he
is
carrying
half
the
accursed
we
survive
this
it
might
be
best
for
me
to
kill
as
they
rode
on
daoud
kept
glancing
over
his
shoulder
their
pursuers
were
gaining
on
them
celino
horse
carrying
two
riders
was
holding
daoud
party
back
but
that
meant
the
men
from
the
inn
would
soon
be
within
the
arbalest
short
range
he
had
only
three
bolts
left
in
the
box
under
the
stock
he
wished
he
had
a
heavy
turkish
bow
the
kind
he
had
used
at
the
battle
of
the
well
of
goliath
almost
as
powerful
as
a
crossbow
it
was
easier
to
handle
on
horseback
and
would
shoot
much
farther
they
will
see
how
mamelukes
his
eyes
were
now
completely
adjusted
to
the
faint
moonlight
the
road
took
them
into
a
deep
pine
wood
they
splashed
through
a
puddle
in
a
low
place
then
clambered
up
a
slope
down
the
other
side
at
the
bottom
of
the
next
slope
daoud
twisted
around
in
the
saddle
letting
go
of
the
reins
and
guiding
the
horse
with
his
knees
he
aimed
the
crossbow
at
the
top
of
the
hill
when
the
first
rider
came
over
the
crest
clearly
visible
in
the
moonlight
daoud
pressed
the
catch
with
his
thumb
and
released
the
bolt
an
instant
later
the
man
fell
without
a
sound
he
told
himself
a
warrior
of
god
should
not
rejoice
at
the
death
of
an
enemy
but
he
could
not
help
a
small
surge
of
satisfaction
at
his
good
shooting
daoud
cranked
the
string
back
and
another
bolt
snapped
into
place
he
hit
the
next
man
on
the
downslope
it
was
a
harder
shot
and
this
man
did
not
die
instantly
but
toppled
screaming
out
of
the
saddle
after
glancing
forward
to
make
sure
of
the
road
ahead
daoud
turned
again
and
saw
that
the
three
remaining
men
had
stopped
their
horses
milling
around
the
fallen
men
they
would
give
up
pursuit
now
daoud
was
sure
of
it
doubtless
none
of
them
had
any
real
weapons
and
they
could
not
contend
with
a
crossbow
he
felt
his
lips
stretch
in
a
grin
and
he
sighed
deeply
with
relief
he
had
been
more
worried
than
he
realized
he
and
his
companions
topped
another
hill
and
when
he
looked
back
again
their
pursuers
had
disappeared
below
its
crest
daoud
raised
his
hand
and
called
out
slow
down
to
a
trot
no
one
seems
to
be
following
us
we
can
be
easier
on
the
old
man
and
the
horses
and
on
scipio
celino
said
pointing
down
to
a
great
shadow
racing
with
them
along
the
side
of
the
road
daoud
could
hear
the
hound
panting
and
his
claws
drumming
on
the
paving
stones
he
wondered
how
long
scipio
could
keep
up
with
galloping
horses
then
reminded
himself
that
this
was
a
hunting
dog
scipio
could
probably
outrun
horses
soon
the
appian
way
will
take
us
to
the
old
walls
of
rome
said
celino
the
watchmen
there
would
question
us
but
we
can
go
off
to
the
left
toward
the
tiber
and
skirt
the
city
because
celino
knows
such
things
i
can
not
kill
him
but
i
must
see
to
it
that
he
never
again
does
anything
like
this
to
endanger
as
they
rode
on
daoud
realized
that
the
old
man
had
stopped
moaning
he
heard
celino
whispering
something
that
sounded
like
a
prayer
how
fares
the
old
man
celino
sounded
angry
he
dead
on
the
other
side
of
celino
the
boy
let
out
a
wail
of
anguish
and
then
sobbed
bitterly
daoud
felt
a
surge
of
grief
he
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
for
the
boy
or
for
himself
we
should
leave
his
body
behind
he
said
to
celino
going
this
fast
that
horse
can
not
carry
both
of
you
much
farther
anger
at
all
this
useless
trouble
constricted
his
throat
and
made
his
voice
husky
the
boy
cried
no
it
was
almost
a
scream
i
can
manage
said
celino
i
will
not
leave
him
the
boy
shouted
sophia
whispered
i
wish
we
had
never
seen
them
without
our
help
they
might
only
have
been
robbed
that
poor
boy
celino
clenched
his
fist
and
muttered
to
himself
then
he
looked
up
and
motioned
to
daoud
pointing
out
a
road
diverging
westward
from
the
appian
way
daoud
jerked
the
reins
of
his
horse
and
the
hooves
no
longer
rang
on
old
roman
paving
stones
but
thudded
on
dirt
the
trees
closed
together
overhead
and
they
rode
for
a
time
in
almost
total
darkness
celino
dropped
back
now
and
daoud
glancing
over
his
shoulder
a
little
later
saw
the
boy
and
celino
in
conversation
as
they
rode
side
by
side
after
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
so
celino
rode
back
to
join
daoud
and
sophia
the
old
man
body
was
draped
over
his
horse
back
in
front
of
him
you
have
much
to
answer
to
me
for
daoud
said
i
know
that
said
celino
but
as
long
as
we
are
out
of
rome
by
morning
we
are
safe
the
giudecca
the
jewish
quarter
is
along
the
tiber
on
the
south
side
of
the
city
we
can
leave
the
boy
with
them
and
they
will
help
him
bury
his
father
and
take
him
in
it
is
not
far
from
here
daoud
could
not
see
his
face
clearly
in
the
dark
but
there
was
a
note
of
pleading
in
his
tone
how
far
daoud
demanded
we
will
be
there
long
before
dawn
but
then
we
will
have
to
go
into
the
city
daoud
said
how
do
we
explain
to
the
roman
watchmen
why
we
are
carrying
an
old
man
dead
of
a
knife
wound
surely
they
will
be
at
least
as
thorough
in
inspecting
baggage
as
you
were
at
lucera
celino
was
silent
a
moment
you
two
can
cross
a
bridge
that
will
take
you
west
of
the
city
i
will
take
the
old
man
body
and
the
boy
to
the
giudecca
and
i
will
be
the
only
one
who
will
have
to
deal
with
the
watch
sophia
spoke
up
as
you
dealt
with
those
ruffians
at
the
inn
then
we
will
have
all
of
rome
hunting
us
all
of
rome
celino
chuckled
the
romans
can
agree
on
only
one
thing
fighting
among
themselves
there
are
powerful
ghibellino
families
here
who
will
protect
us
if
need
be
he
needed
this
damned
lorenzo
daoud
thought
because
of
his
connections
with
the
ghibellini
how
did
the
men
at
the
inn
know
the
old
man
was
a
jew
daoud
asked
celino
the
hat
he
was
wearing
celino
said
all
jews
are
required
to
wear
those
round
black
hats
in
the
papal
states
to
make
it
easier
for
good
christians
to
persecute
them
daoud
shook
his
head
even
christians
were
treated
better
than
that
in
did
not
know
somehow
out
of
all
that
i
learned
about
the
christian
world
that
detail
about
hats
for
jews
was
left
out
a
little
thing
too
trivial
to
be
mentioned
what
other
deadly
little
omissions
lie
in
wait
for
me
he
felt
like
a
man
in
chains
he
would
have
to
keep
celino
with
him
and
the
prospect
infuriated
him
as
they
continued
riding
westward
daoud
heard
the
boy
weeping
it
made
him
think
of
nights
in
the
mameluke
barracks
on
raudha
island
when
he
lay
on
his
pallet
biting
his
knuckles
so
no
one
would
hear
him
sob
as
he
cried
for
his
mother
and
father
and
for
himself
so
lost
and
lonely
will
help
the
boy
bury
his
father
if
it
does
not
endanger
this
boy
too
was
lost
and
lonely
as
daoud
had
been
while
training
to
be
a
mameluke
as
nicetas
had
been
it
had
been
a
chilly
day
the
day
that
daoud
and
nicetas
became
friends
huge
gray
clouds
billowed
in
the
east
over
the
sinai
desert
in
the
lee
of
a
cliff
formed
of
giant
blocks
of
red
sandstone
a
dozen
small
tents
clustered
on
a
restless
brown
pony
with
a
body
daoud
waited
in
a
line
of
nearly
thirty
julbans
mamelukes
in
training
similarly
mounted
soon
it
would
be
his
turn
to
ride
past
the
wooden
ring
that
a
pair
of
slaves
was
swinging
from
side
to
side
between
the
legs
of
a
scaffold
in
his
hand
daoud
grasped
a
rumh
a
lightweight
lance
longer
than
a
body
with
a
tip
of
sharpened
bone
on
a
low
rise
of
brown
gravel
mahmoud
the
circassian
naqeeb
in
charge
of
their
training
troop
sat
astride
a
sleek
brown
arab
half
blood
he
looked
almost
regal
in
his
long
scarlet
kaftan
and
fur
cap
his
beard
was
full
and
gray
and
a
necklace
of
gold
coins
hung
down
to
his
waist
the
boys
wore
round
caps
of
undyed
cotton
cloth
and
striped
robes
and
they
rode
scrubby
ponies
from
atop
a
galloping
horse
each
boy
was
expected
to
hurl
his
rumh
unerringly
through
the
ring
whose
diameter
was
two
handspans
the
ring
was
attached
to
three
strong
slender
ropes
one
rope
suspended
it
from
the
scaffold
the
other
two
went
out
to
either
side
where
the
slaves
held
them
pulling
in
turn
on
the
ropes
the
two
slaves
swung
the
ring
from
side
to
side
the
boy
just
ahead
of
daoud
in
line
was
a
new
member
of
the
troop
of
young
mamelukes
his
face
was
smooth
and
his
skin
pale
his
hair
and
eyes
very
black
he
turned
to
daoud
and
said
what
if
we
hit
one
of
those
slaves
by
mistake
daoud
had
once
seen
a
slave
transfixed
by
a
wild
cast
of
the
rumh
it
hurt
to
remember
his
screams
and
thrashings
wound
a
slave
and
you
will
be
beaten
he
said
kill
a
slave
and
you
go
without
water
for
three
days
in
this
desert
that
is
a
death
sentence
the
boy
whistled
and
shrugged
hard
punishments
for
us
but
not
much
comfort
to
the
slaves
i
say
it
comforts
them
to
know
we
have
reason
to
be
careful
daoud
answered
after
a
moment
the
boy
smiled
hesitantly
and
said
i
am
nicetas
from
trebizond
where
are
you
from
daoud
rubbed
his
pony
neck
to
settle
it
down
ascalon
not
far
from
here
i
am
called
daoud
he
saw
the
puzzlement
in
nicetas
face
and
added
my
parents
were
franks
oh
said
nicetas
and
looked
sympathetic
as
if
he
had
instantly
grasped
what
had
happened
to
daoud
mother
and
father
and
how
he
came
to
be
a
mameluke
my
mother
was
a
whore
nicetas
said
without
any
sign
of
embarrassment
she
sold
me
to
the
turks
when
i
was
eight
and
i
was
glad
to
go
she
had
sold
me
for
other
things
before
that
this
is
a
good
life
you
learn
to
ride
and
shoot
mamelukes
wear
gold
and
they
lord
it
over
everybody
else
daoud
felt
a
slight
easing
of
the
tension
of
waiting
to
cast
the
rumh
he
enjoyed
talking
to
this
new
boy
there
was
a
warmth
and
liveliness
in
him
that
daoud
liked
and
even
though
their
lives
had
been
different
daoud
felt
more
of
a
kinship
with
this
boy
than
he
ever
had
with
any
of
the
others
in
his
training
group
mamelukes
have
a
good
life
if
they
live
said
daoud
where
is
trebizond
nicetas
waved
his
left
hand
north
of
here
it
is
a
greek
city
on
the
black
sea
but
i
suppose
you
have
never
heard
of
the
black
sea
i
know
where
the
black
sea
is
said
daoud
somewhat
annoyed
that
nicetas
should
think
him
totally
ignorant
how
did
you
come
to
join
our
orta
i
was
enrolled
in
the
fakri
the
mamelukes
of
emir
fakr
the
emir
was
killed
by
the
frankish
invaders
last
year
the
older
fakri
are
staying
together
but
the
young
ones
have
been
transferred
out
to
the
other
ortas
daoud
found
himself
feeling
somewhat
sorry
for
nicetas
he
knew
how
lonely
the
greek
boy
must
be
his
khushdashiya
his
barracks
comrades
were
the
nearest
he
had
to
a
family
and
even
at
that
he
was
not
really
close
to
the
other
boys
he
was
the
only
frank
among
them
and
to
talk
to
them
at
all
he
had
to
learn
their
various
languages
turkish
kurd
farsi
circassian
tartar
they
would
not
bother
to
learn
the
norman
french
which
was
still
the
language
he
heard
in
his
dreams
most
of
the
boys
slept
two
by
two
in
the
field
but
daoud
had
no
close
friend
to
share
a
tent
with
go
shouted
mahmoud
the
circassian
to
nicetas
the
greek
boy
stood
up
in
the
saddle
and
rode
down
the
field
with
a
warbling
scream
that
was
a
perfect
imitation
of
a
bedouin
war
cry
his
trousers
billowed
against
his
long
legs
daoud
watched
his
handsome
profile
as
he
turned
to
fix
his
eyes
on
the
swinging
target
the
bare
arm
drew
back
and
snapped
forward
the
long
black
pole
of
the
rumh
whistled
through
the
air
shot
smoothly
through
the
ring
and
landed
upright
quivering
in
the
dune
beyond
it
daoud
heard
murmurs
of
appreciation
around
him
at
the
naqeeb
next
cry
of
go
daoud
kicked
his
pony
in
the
ribs
and
plunged
forward
to
try
his
own
cast
he
tried
to
ignore
the
fear
of
missing
that
knotted
his
belly
muscles
tried
not
to
think
at
all
about
his
desperate
need
to
make
a
good
cast
he
guided
his
mount
with
the
pressure
of
his
knees
he
squinted
his
eyes
against
the
wind
of
his
rush
and
fixed
them
on
the
ring
his
body
moved
up
and
down
with
the
action
of
the
horse
and
the
ring
swung
back
and
forth
he
twisted
sideways
in
the
saddle
steadying
himself
with
one
hand
on
the
pony
back
grasping
the
rumh
at
the
middle
so
that
it
balanced
he
lifted
it
high
over
his
head
the
little
horse
muscles
rippled
under
his
palm
if
he
fixed
his
gaze
and
his
aim
on
the
point
in
space
that
the
ring
occupied
at
the
lowest
point
of
its
arc
and
released
his
rumh
just
as
the
ring
reached
the
extremity
of
its
swing
the
target
and
rumh
should
arrive
together
the
pony
had
carried
him
opposite
the
ring
now
and
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
whipped
his
arm
forward
his
lance
reached
the
right
spot
an
instant
too
late
he
wanted
to
throw
himself
down
from
his
horse
and
weep
with
frustration
he
heard
groans
and
curses
from
behind
him
not
once
this
morning
had
the
troop
had
a
perfect
round
he
rode
around
to
the
back
of
the
scaffold
where
the
two
slaves
were
sitting
until
the
next
boy
should
take
his
turn
the
ghulmans
kept
their
eyes
down
their
black
faces
expressionless
angrily
he
yanked
his
rumh
out
of
the
sand
and
rode
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
nicetas
patted
his
arm
reassuringly
two
more
boys
missed
after
daoud
and
that
also
made
him
feel
a
bit
better
it
occurred
to
daoud
that
nicetas
was
one
of
the
few
who
had
not
once
missed
the
ring
that
morning
he
was
a
good
horseman
and
seemed
to
have
a
remarkably
keen
eye
with
the
rumh
the
only
other
boy
in
the
troop
who
was
that
good
daoud
thought
was
kassar
the
kipchaq
tartar
daoud
looked
around
for
kassar
and
saw
him
sitting
on
his
pony
partway
out
of
line
eyeing
nicetas
sourly
head
was
round
his
face
flat
and
he
was
already
old
enough
to
have
grown
a
small
black
mustache
from
now
on
the
naqeeb
bellowed
from
his
hilltop
anyone
who
misses
once
will
not
eat
today
anyone
who
misses
twice
will
sleep
in
the
desert
tonight
without
tent
or
blankets
nicetas
who
was
wearing
a
long
sleeveless
robe
grinned
and
shook
himself
it
will
be
cold
out
there
tonight
what
if
someone
misses
a
third
time
naqeeb
someone
called
out
he
is
no
longer
mameluke
said
mahmoud
in
a
soft
voice
that
carried
he
goes
back
to
el
kahira
to
be
a
ghulman
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
kill
himself
first
daoud
thought
he
would
plunge
his
dagger
into
his
own
heart
before
he
would
let
that
happen
to
him
a
frozen
silence
fell
over
the
troop
the
only
sound
daoud
could
hear
was
the
desert
wind
hissing
past
his
ears
but
he
felt
the
fear
all
around
him
just
as
he
felt
the
wind
mahmoud
threat
seemed
to
help
the
troop
marksmanship
only
one
boy
missed
in
the
next
round
in
that
round
and
the
one
that
followed
daoud
rumh
flew
true
both
times
the
second
time
he
felt
dizzy
with
relief
and
he
leaned
forward
and
hugged
his
horse
neck
as
he
rode
back
to
his
place
one
more
round
and
they
could
rest
daoud
body
ached
especially
his
back
and
his
arms
he
felt
a
clenching
in
his
stomach
knowing
that
he
had
to
get
his
lance
through
the
ring
this
time
his
khushdashiya
would
hate
him
and
he
would
hate
himself
if
he
missed
and
the
more
he
feared
missing
the
more
he
would
be
likely
to
miss
never
mind
hitting
a
slave
said
nicetas
just
before
his
turn
do
us
all
a
favor
hit
the
naqeeb
daoud
laughed
nicetas
rode
out
and
hit
the
target
as
usual
feeling
less
tense
daoud
rode
out
to
make
his
third
cast
he
held
his
breath
until
he
saw
his
long
lance
sail
smoothly
through
the
circle
he
shouted
with
joy
and
turned
his
mount
back
toward
the
troop
he
did
not
hug
his
horse
this
time
laughing
he
rode
up
beside
nicetas
threw
his
arms
around
him
and
pulled
the
skinny
body
against
his
larger
frame
nicetas
eyes
seemed
to
sparkle
as
they
looked
into
his
when
daoud
let
him
go
it
turned
out
to
be
another
perfect
round
and
mahmoud
declared
they
could
stop
to
pray
and
eat
god
daoud
said
fervently
to
himself
the
sun
had
crossed
from
the
zenith
to
the
western
part
of
the
sky
mahmoud
led
them
in
reciting
the
prayers
facing
south
toward
mecca
then
each
julban
took
a
portion
of
stale
bread
and
dry
goat
cheese
from
a
pouch
hanging
from
his
saddle
and
a
single
draft
from
his
water
skin
the
swallow
of
warm
water
daoud
took
tasted
foul
but
he
had
to
fight
down
the
impulse
to
drink
more
he
sat
down
before
his
small
tent
to
eat
may
i
sit
with
you
daoud
squinted
up
into
the
sun
to
see
the
greek
boy
standing
over
him
please
said
daoud
gesturing
to
the
sand
beside
him
they
ate
in
silence
for
a
time
daoud
looked
up
from
the
hard
bread
he
was
relentlessly
chewing
and
saw
nicetas
smiling
at
him
he
smiled
back
you
were
eating
by
yourself
nicetas
said
do
you
sleep
alone
too
daoud
nodded
would
you
like
to
have
a
tent
mate
before
daoud
could
answer
a
shadow
fell
over
them
daoud
looked
up
kassar
stood
between
them
and
the
sun
half
a
dozen
of
his
friends
around
him
he
glowered
down
at
nicetas
you
think
you
are
good
nicetas
smile
was
friendly
it
is
in
the
blood
greeks
are
good
at
games
you
throw
like
a
girl
kassar
said
to
nicetas
the
kipchaq
followers
laughed
dutifully
daoud
felt
his
face
burn
with
anger
he
wanted
to
say
something
on
nicetas
behalf
even
though
it
was
the
rule
that
each
boy
must
defend
himself
nicetas
still
smiling
pleasantly
and
looking
quite
unafraid
stood
up
with
lithe
grace
to
face
kassar
my
rumh
pierces
the
target
he
said
making
a
circle
with
thumb
and
forefinger
and
pushing
his
other
forefinger
into
it
you
have
to
be
a
man
to
do
that
this
time
the
laughter
was
spontaneous
but
kassar
did
not
smile
i
will
bet
with
you
that
i
can
throw
the
rumh
better
than
you
can
said
kassar
grimly
i
will
make
you
a
handsome
bet
i
will
put
up
the
mail
shirt
that
i
took
from
a
frankish
knight
at
mansura
daoud
felt
the
sting
of
envy
if
he
had
only
been
a
year
or
two
older
he
too
might
have
souvenirs
of
that
battle
i
possess
nothing
of
value
said
nicetas
what
can
i
put
up
against
your
mail
shirt
grinning
kassar
stepped
closer
to
the
greek
bringing
his
face
down
till
nicetas
nose
almost
touched
his
flat
one
you
will
spend
the
night
in
my
tent
whenever
i
want
you
his
thick
fingers
gripped
nicetas
chin
kneading
the
flesh
of
his
face
nicetas
blushed
and
pulled
away
rubbing
his
chin
but
still
he
smiled
if
your
hand
is
that
rough
i
do
not
wonder
you
need
a
new
tent
mate
this
time
the
boys
all
roared
with
laughter
and
kassar
eyes
narrowed
to
angry
slits
daoud
had
never
before
heard
anyone
speak
openly
of
what
all
the
boys
were
aware
of
but
only
whispered
about
for
more
than
a
year
daoud
had
seen
and
felt
his
body
changing
and
had
been
tormented
by
steadily
growing
needs
within
himself
he
sensed
that
others
of
his
khushdashiya
were
tormented
by
the
same
nearly
unbearable
hungers
he
knew
from
listening
to
the
talk
of
older
men
that
the
answer
to
all
these
yearnings
lay
in
women
but
julbans
were
forbidden
the
company
of
women
he
quickly
learned
how
to
relieve
himself
in
solitude
and
suspected
many
of
the
others
did
the
same
but
some
he
was
sure
made
use
of
each
other
bodies
i
accept
the
contest
said
nicetas
staring
fearlessly
into
eyes
we
must
go
to
the
naqeeb
for
permission
said
kassar
but
we
will
not
tell
him
the
stakes
he
might
get
ideas
about
you
he
grinned
at
nicetas
with
such
frank
lasciviousness
that
daoud
remembering
how
his
captors
had
raped
him
years
ago
wanted
to
smash
his
fist
into
the
tartar
big
white
teeth
he
followed
nicetas
and
kassar
as
they
went
to
mahmoud
large
silk
tent
and
explained
the
contest
yes
said
mahmoud
leading
the
way
back
to
the
practice
field
put
the
ring
on
and
you
will
ride
fifty
paces
from
the
target
you
will
cast
until
one
of
you
misses
and
the
other
follows
with
a
hit
if
both
of
you
miss
you
will
be
beaten
for
disturbing
my
rest
the
slaves
changed
the
target
ring
for
the
smaller
one
and
began
pulling
on
the
guide
ropes
that
swung
the
ring
from
side
to
side
the
naqeeb
paced
off
the
distance
for
kassar
and
nicetas
at
mahmoud
command
kassar
rode
down
the
field
he
made
a
perfect
cast
and
his
friends
cheered
it
was
nicetas
turn
and
he
flew
past
the
target
with
his
warbling
scream
standing
in
the
stirrups
there
was
something
in
the
way
he
stood
swaying
with
the
jolting
movement
of
his
pony
left
arm
outstretched
to
balance
himself
rumh
poised
to
throw
is
daoud
thought
nicetas
rumh
went
perfectly
through
the
ring
the
cheer
for
him
was
lower
after
all
nobody
knew
him
daoud
called
out
god
guides
your
arm
nicetas
some
of
the
other
boys
stared
at
him
and
his
face
grew
hot
both
contestants
made
successful
second
casts
but
when
kassar
made
his
third
throw
daoud
saw
the
ring
wobble
slightly
the
rumh
must
have
brushed
its
inner
edge
nicetas
third
try
once
again
was
flawless
we
can
not
be
at
this
till
sunset
mahmoud
grumbled
move
out
to
seventy
paces
he
paced
off
the
new
distance
and
kassar
and
nicetas
not
looking
at
each
other
rode
to
the
spot
he
pointed
out
to
throw
the
rumh
accurately
from
that
distance
would
take
great
strength
as
well
as
a
keen
eye
daoud
thought
looking
at
slender
arms
and
narrow
shoulders
he
wondered
if
the
greek
boy
could
manage
it
a
wind
rose
stinging
daoud
face
with
tiny
sand
particles
it
was
blowing
from
the
east
across
the
field
where
the
boys
rode
nicetas
would
be
lucky
to
get
his
lance
anywhere
near
the
scaffold
at
mahmoud
barking
command
kassar
galloped
out
across
the
field
he
half
rose
as
he
came
abreast
of
the
target
and
daoud
saw
his
powerful
shoulder
muscles
bunch
under
his
thin
robe
there
was
a
loud
crack
as
kassar
rumh
hit
the
ring
daoud
saw
black
fragments
fly
though
the
air
he
gasped
in
surprise
kassar
lance
had
hit
the
side
of
the
target
ring
and
the
wood
had
shattered
under
the
impact
well
mahmoud
turned
to
nicetas
with
a
laugh
the
target
is
destroyed
let
us
put
another
ring
on
said
nicetas
promptly
just
as
kassar
rode
up
kassar
face
was
tight
with
fury
the
rings
are
different
sizes
it
will
not
be
fair
if
you
have
a
bigger
ring
to
hit
i
want
a
smaller
ring
said
nicetas
with
a
faint
smile
mahmoud
sent
a
boy
galloping
to
the
target
pullers
with
the
order
to
attach
a
new
ring
to
the
ropes
from
where
he
stood
daoud
could
not
even
see
daylight
through
the
new
ring
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
whirlwind
raising
a
cone
of
sand
a
sand
devil
spinning
near
the
red
cliff
think
that
there
is
a
crusader
charging
at
you
and
you
have
to
hit
him
in
the
eye
to
stop
him
mahmoud
suggested
to
nicetas
if
it
were
i
would
not
let
him
get
close
enough
for
me
to
his
eye
said
nicetas
dryly
go
mahmoud
roared
nicetas
screamed
across
the
field
the
rumh
flew
daoud
cried
out
in
amazement
as
the
lance
no
bigger
than
a
splinter
at
this
distance
shot
perfectly
through
the
ring
joy
was
a
white
light
momentarily
blinding
daoud
his
heart
was
beating
as
hard
and
fast
as
if
it
had
been
he
who
had
made
the
cast
nicetas
yah
nicetas
he
cheered
loud
cries
of
admiration
went
up
nicetas
retrieved
his
rumh
and
waved
it
over
his
head
standing
in
the
stirrups
as
he
rode
back
to
the
troop
he
jumped
down
from
his
horse
and
kassar
already
dismounted
went
to
meet
him
kassar
heavy
walk
his
clenched
fists
the
rage
in
his
face
told
daoud
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
he
felt
hot
anger
surging
up
inside
him
but
he
reminded
himself
again
that
nicetas
must
fight
his
own
battles
the
boys
surrounded
kassar
and
nicetas
the
naqeeb
with
his
green
turban
in
their
midst
daoud
pushed
himself
into
the
innermost
circle
bring
me
the
mail
shirt
said
nicetas
won
kassar
declared
glowering
down
at
him
i
smashed
the
ring
a
thing
you
are
too
weak
to
do
he
looked
away
from
nicetas
and
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
glaring
around
the
circle
of
boys
challenging
any
of
them
to
contradict
him
no
one
spoke
no
one
wanted
to
quarrel
with
kassar
especially
on
behalf
of
a
boy
no
one
knew
daoud
felt
angry
words
rushing
up
inside
him
but
he
kept
himself
in
check
to
take
up
nicetas
quarrel
unasked
would
insult
nicetas
if
things
got
too
far
out
of
hand
the
naqeeb
would
intervene
daoud
felt
himself
abruptly
pushed
to
one
side
he
turned
to
protest
and
then
checked
himself
it
was
mahmoud
leaving
the
circle
that
surrounded
nicetas
and
kassar
as
daoud
watched
in
amazement
the
naqeeb
walked
to
his
tent
and
sat
down
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
it
calmly
gazing
at
the
sandstone
cliffs
as
if
what
was
going
on
did
not
concern
him
at
all
should
be
the
one
to
declare
nicetas
the
daoud
thought
as
angry
now
as
he
was
astonished
he
too
afraid
of
kassar
when
you
broke
the
ring
that
was
a
miss
said
nicetas
you
lost
the
shirt
is
mine
you
will
have
to
take
it
from
me
said
kassar
with
a
grin
come
to
my
tent
and
you
can
wrestle
me
for
it
now
he
made
the
gesture
encircling
his
forefinger
that
nicetas
had
made
before
what
would
nicetas
do
daoud
wondered
he
was
not
big
enough
to
hurt
kassar
but
if
he
yielded
kassar
would
make
a
slave
of
him
and
subject
him
to
abominations
i
had
heard
that
a
tartar
never
goes
back
on
his
word
said
nicetas
i
see
now
that
at
least
one
tartar
is
a
lying
jackal
daoud
thought
fiercely
in
a
battle
of
insults
he
felt
sure
the
talkative
greek
would
have
the
upper
hand
over
the
dour
tartar
kassar
reddened
and
he
smashed
his
fist
into
nicetas
jaw
the
greek
boy
fell
to
the
ground
and
daoud
saw
that
his
eyes
were
blank
dazed
but
nicetas
shook
his
head
and
forced
himself
to
his
feet
your
fist
ca
restore
your
honor
kassar
you
have
fucked
it
too
many
times
loud
laughter
burst
out
from
the
watching
boys
choked
off
as
again
the
tartar
swung
hitting
nicetas
in
the
mouth
the
boy
was
thrown
back
against
the
onlookers
and
blood
ran
from
his
nose
and
mouth
daoud
felt
the
blood
pounding
his
temples
as
his
anger
grew
as
long
as
it
was
just
kassar
against
nicetas
he
could
not
get
into
the
fight
but
if
kassar
friends
joined
in
he
promised
himself
he
would
help
nicetas
take
back
what
you
said
kassar
growled
advancing
on
him
daoud
could
not
see
nicetas
behind
kassar
bulky
form
but
suddenly
kassar
head
snapped
back
and
his
white
cap
fell
off
into
the
sand
the
kipchaq
fell
back
and
daoud
saw
that
nicetas
was
on
his
feet
grinning
through
the
blood
and
rubbing
his
knuckles
yah
nicetas
he
shouted
but
he
was
alone
in
cheering
he
sensed
others
looking
at
him
may
they
burn
in
the
flames
if
they
did
not
see
that
nicetas
was
the
better
man
kassar
plowed
into
nicetas
pummeling
him
with
both
fists
when
nicetas
collapsed
under
the
punishment
kassar
kicked
him
in
the
head
sending
him
flying
backward
kassar
friends
shouted
encouragement
daoud
felt
his
whole
body
growing
hot
with
anger
nicetas
rolled
over
on
his
stomach
raised
himself
on
hands
and
knees
and
spat
blood
his
eyes
searched
the
crowd
of
boys
watching
him
and
kassar
and
daoud
knew
that
he
was
looking
for
a
friend
nicetas
daoud
cried
and
the
greek
boy
dazed
eyes
found
him
and
his
bloody
mouth
stretched
in
a
grin
but
if
nicetas
did
not
give
up
kassar
would
kill
him
suddenly
daoud
turned
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
hurried
to
where
mahmoud
was
still
sitting
why
do
you
not
stop
this
he
demanded
it
is
your
duty
to
keep
order
among
us
do
not
tell
me
my
duty
said
mahmoud
have
you
forgotten
what
my
cane
feels
like
you
would
use
the
cane
on
daoud
exclaimed
outraged
when
kassar
is
cheating
there
were
a
thousand
tiny
wrinkles
around
mahmoud
blue
circassian
eyes
from
a
lifetime
of
squinting
into
the
sun
daoud
i
will
tell
you
what
my
duty
is
my
duty
is
to
take
miserable
julbans
and
make
mamelukes
of
you
when
you
are
a
mameluke
there
will
be
no
naqeeb
over
you
to
right
your
wrongs
among
mamelukes
he
who
is
strongest
rules
if
kassar
is
the
strongest
among
you
you
must
be
ruled
by
him
daoud
growled
with
disgust
and
ran
back
to
the
fight
nicetas
had
somehow
gotten
back
on
his
feet
though
his
face
was
a
mass
of
blood
and
dirt
and
his
breath
was
coming
in
gasps
his
eyes
were
glazed
but
he
managed
to
stagger
forward
and
hit
kassar
in
the
nose
with
his
fist
blood
began
to
flow
from
the
young
tartar
wide
nostrils
into
his
mustache
kassar
put
his
fingers
to
his
upper
lip
took
them
away
and
stared
at
the
blood
his
eyes
widened
in
fury
his
head
swung
right
and
left
then
he
sidestepped
to
a
boy
in
front
of
the
circle
from
the
boy
sash
he
pulled
a
dabbus
a
fluted
iron
cylinder
mounted
on
a
wooden
staff
swinging
the
dabbus
so
it
whistled
through
the
air
kassar
charged
at
nicetas
the
boys
fell
back
opening
the
circle
wider
for
the
first
time
daoud
saw
fear
in
nicetas
eyes
he
ducked
as
kassar
swung
the
mace
at
his
head
but
his
movements
were
slow
and
awkward
he
had
been
hit
too
many
times
he
fell
stood
up
and
staggered
backward
the
naqeeb
would
not
interfere
this
could
end
only
one
way
and
daoud
knew
that
he
did
not
want
to
see
nicetas
die
before
his
eyes
he
would
not
allow
it
only
moments
ago
rage
had
raised
a
great
storm
within
him
but
now
his
mind
was
like
the
desert
after
the
storm
has
passed
still
and
empty
like
the
desert
he
felt
himself
full
of
a
terrible
power
without
any
more
thought
he
stepped
out
into
the
ring
behind
kassar
and
shouted
kassar
enough
the
tartar
whirled
holding
the
dabbus
at
shoulder
height
stay
out
of
this
pigshit
frank
let
him
be
kassar
almost
all
daoud
attention
was
on
kassar
but
a
part
of
his
mind
was
free
to
wonder
why
he
felt
no
fear
at
all
somehow
he
was
not
sure
how
the
hours
with
saadi
had
something
to
do
with
it
put
that
down
daoud
said
pointing
at
the
dabbus
in
your
head
kassar
shouted
and
charged
at
him
daoud
kept
his
eyes
on
kassar
but
in
the
edge
of
his
vision
he
saw
the
ridged
mass
of
iron
heavy
enough
to
crack
a
steel
helmet
rushing
toward
his
head
his
head
protected
only
by
a
cloth
cap
at
the
last
possible
moment
he
threw
up
his
hand
and
caught
wrist
he
stepped
back
out
of
the
path
of
the
dabbus
and
jerked
downward
on
kassar
arm
the
weight
of
the
mace
helped
throw
kassar
off
balance
and
he
landed
on
his
chest
with
a
grunt
the
air
driven
out
of
him
daoud
stamped
on
kassar
forearm
and
yanked
the
dabbus
out
of
his
grasp
he
flung
himself
down
on
kassar
and
pinned
him
to
the
sand
though
all
his
attention
was
on
kassar
there
was
room
in
his
mind
for
a
triumphant
surprise
akbar
god
is
great
i
never
thought
i
had
the
strength
to
throw
the
nicetas
won
the
contest
admit
it
or
i
break
your
skull
he
growled
holding
the
dabbus
over
kassar
head
kassar
remained
silent
daoud
lowered
the
dabbus
and
tapped
the
round
skull
through
his
mop
of
straight
black
hair
he
hit
kassar
just
hard
enough
to
let
him
feel
the
weight
of
the
dabbus
admit
that
nicetas
won
all
right
kassar
grunted
his
face
in
the
sand
he
won
swear
by
the
prophet
you
will
leave
him
alone
from
now
on
i
swear
came
the
muffled
voice
by
the
prophet
by
the
prophet
daoud
stood
up
warily
and
handed
the
dabbus
back
to
the
boy
kassar
had
taken
it
from
kassar
rose
slowly
wiping
sand
from
his
face
his
eyes
seemed
to
spark
with
hatred
is
not
finished
daoud
thought
he
looked
for
nicetas
the
greek
boy
was
on
his
feet
he
was
wiping
the
dirt
and
blood
from
his
face
with
the
hem
of
his
robe
he
looked
at
daoud
and
there
was
something
bright
and
solemn
in
his
eyes
no
one
had
ever
looked
at
daoud
like
that
before
daoud
felt
a
great
rush
of
gratitude
to
god
for
giving
him
the
strength
to
save
nicetas
life
i
had
not
fought
kassar
nicetas
would
be
that
face
so
full
of
warmth
and
wit
would
be
so
much
lifeless
clay
daoud
felt
a
lightness
in
his
heart
and
a
smile
bubbling
to
his
lips
he
was
proud
of
his
strength
he
had
used
it
to
save
a
precious
life
he
was
a
warrior
of
god
smiling
he
went
to
nicetas
and
threw
his
arm
around
his
shoulders
he
should
force
kassar
to
give
nicetas
the
mail
shirt
but
he
had
done
enough
fighting
for
one
day
nicetas
did
not
need
the
damned
shirt
let
the
tartar
keep
it
now
then
you
wretched
sons
of
desert
rats
came
mahmoud
voice
he
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
of
the
ring
coin
necklace
glittering
eyes
flashing
in
anger
fighting
eh
trying
to
kill
each
other
save
your
fighting
for
the
emir
enemies
you
are
khushdashiya
brother
mamelukes
of
emir
baibars
if
again
i
see
one
of
you
raise
a
hand
against
his
brother
i
swear
i
will
stake
him
out
on
the
sand
he
raised
his
right
hand
to
heaven
hear
me
god
the
naqeeb
had
a
strange
way
of
making
mamelukes
out
of
them
daoud
thought
but
perhaps
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
that
night
without
anyone
saying
any
more
nicetas
brought
his
tent
and
his
bedding
to
daoud
they
compared
tents
and
decided
that
was
the
larger
they
would
sleep
in
it
after
they
had
tended
their
ponies
and
joined
with
the
rest
of
the
troop
in
the
final
prayer
of
the
night
they
crawled
into
the
tent
and
spread
their
bedding
side
by
side
daoud
felt
nicetas
moving
in
his
half
of
the
tent
and
heard
a
rustling
as
if
his
new
tent
mate
were
shedding
his
clothes
why
would
he
do
that
on
such
a
cold
night
nicetas
pulled
his
blankets
over
both
of
them
and
rolled
toward
daoud
the
greek
boy
skin
felt
warm
and
nicetas
wriggled
even
closer
and
stroked
daoud
chest
arousing
pleasant
tingles
daoud
felt
keener
than
ever
the
powerful
longings
that
had
been
troubling
him
but
then
he
remembered
cruel
turkish
laughter
and
rough
hands
the
unbearable
pain
and
shame
of
his
first
nights
of
captivity
he
struggled
to
free
himself
from
nicetas
arms
all
at
once
nicetas
let
go
of
him
and
turned
over
leaving
a
small
space
in
the
tent
between
them
sleep
well
daoud
there
was
hurt
in
the
soft
voice
remorseful
daoud
reached
for
his
friend
when
his
hand
grasped
the
bare
shoulder
his
fingers
tightened
of
their
own
volition
nicetas
drew
closer
again
until
their
bodies
were
pressed
together
ah
daoud
nicetas
whispered
after
they
had
made
love
daoud
thought
god
sent
nicetas
to
fearing
that
the
thought
might
be
blasphemous
he
put
it
out
of
his
mind
and
fell
into
a
sated
sleep
daoud
sophia
celino
and
the
boy
came
to
a
riverbank
they
had
ridden
in
silence
for
so
long
that
the
moon
crescent
hung
low
in
the
western
sky
casting
a
glow
on
rippling
water
daoud
called
a
halt
and
sat
gazing
at
the
tiber
to
the
bhar
the
river
nile
this
is
the
most
famous
river
in
the
it
was
wide
and
flowed
fast
judging
by
the
ripples
and
looked
deep
looking
upriver
he
saw
that
it
followed
a
winding
course
leading
toward
black
bulks
lit
with
yellow
lights
here
and
there
that
must
be
great
buildings
rome
they
laid
the
old
man
body
down
on
a
cracked
marble
platform
beside
the
river
celino
had
long
since
pulled
the
dagger
out
of
the
old
flesh
and
now
he
handed
it
to
daoud
the
dagger
was
a
throwing
knife
of
good
steel
stained
with
a
film
of
dried
blood
daoud
knelt
washed
it
in
the
tiber
and
wiped
it
with
the
hem
of
his
cloak
he
held
it
out
to
the
boy
i
do
not
want
it
the
boy
face
was
still
wrapped
in
a
blue
scarf
but
daoud
could
see
tears
glittering
on
his
cheek
it
is
a
good
knife
you
may
have
need
of
it
now
that
you
have
no
father
it
is
the
knife
that
killed
him
the
boy
hesitated
all
right
give
it
to
me
daoud
handed
it
to
him
and
the
boy
turned
and
hurled
the
knife
out
over
the
river
it
flew
a
short
distance
and
the
splash
threw
off
light
like
a
handful
of
pearls
well
daoud
said
no
one
had
a
better
right
to
do
that
than
you
he
smiled
to
himself
he
could
understand
quite
well
the
lad
feelings
but
there
was
something
odd
about
the
way
the
boy
arm
had
moved
when
he
threw
the
knife
daoud
recalled
a
phrase
that
he
had
heard
in
memory
while
they
were
riding
toward
the
river
throw
like
a
that
had
not
been
true
of
nicetas
but
it
was
true
of
this
boy
and
his
voice
though
high
was
not
as
light
and
clear
as
the
voice
of
a
child
moved
by
a
sudden
suspicion
daoud
reached
out
too
quickly
for
the
boy
to
draw
away
and
pulled
loose
the
scarf
he
leaned
closer
for
a
good
look
he
heard
celino
standing
behind
him
grunt
with
surprise
revealed
in
the
moonlight
was
not
a
lad
whose
voice
had
not
yet
changed
but
a
girl
her
eyelids
were
puffy
from
her
weeping
but
the
eyelashes
were
long
and
thick
her
nose
delicate
her
lips
full
the
eyes
that
looked
back
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
defiance
were
in
this
light
black
as
obsidian
her
hair
was
coiled
in
a
thick
braid
at
the
back
of
her
head
where
the
scarf
had
hidden
it
he
did
not
have
to
ask
the
reason
for
the
pretense
traveling
with
only
an
aged
father
to
protect
her
she
was
far
safer
as
a
boy
sophia
pushed
past
daoud
and
put
her
arms
around
the
girl
who
began
to
cry
again
you
poor
child
are
you
all
alone
now
there
it
all
right
we
will
help
you
who
was
your
father
said
celino
in
an
equally
kindly
voice
he
was
not
my
father
the
girl
whispered
he
was
angelo
ben
ezra
of
florence
a
seller
of
books
and
he
was
my
husband
sophia
drew
back
in
surprise
then
hugged
the
girl
tighter
oh
poor
little
one
so
young
and
wed
to
such
an
old
man
how
could
your
parents
do
that
to
you
the
girl
angrily
drew
back
from
sophia
do
not
speak
so
my
parents
were
good
to
me
and
my
husband
was
he
never
touched
me
when
my
mother
and
father
died
of
tertian
fever
he
took
me
in
and
he
married
me
so
as
not
to
give
scandal
he
taught
me
to
read
what
is
your
name
girl
celino
asked
rachel
she
dropped
to
her
knees
beside
the
body
stretched
out
on
the
marble
and
her
tears
splashed
on
the
white
face
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
he
is
so
cold
we
must
wrap
him
quickly
and
be
on
our
way
said
daoud
we
have
killed
three
people
and
burned
down
an
inn
i
assure
you
they
have
stopped
chasing
us
only
for
the
moment
celino
i
want
a
word
with
you
sophia
help
the
girl
wrap
her
husband
body
so
we
can
travel
on
i
do
not
need
to
be
commanded
said
sophia
sharply
as
daoud
turned
his
back
on
her
motioning
celino
to
follow
him
in
the
name
of
god
am
i
to
do
with
these
people
daoud
strode
across
the
marble
platform
and
picked
his
way
down
a
flight
of
cracked
stairs
to
the
edge
of
the
tiber
he
followed
a
line
of
tumbled
stones
once
part
of
an
embankment
until
he
felt
sure
sophia
and
the
girl
could
not
hear
them
then
he
whirled
bringing
his
face
inches
from
celino
you
fool
i
ought
to
kill
you
for
what
you
have
done
he
heard
a
soft
growl
to
his
right
send
your
damned
dog
away
he
said
without
taking
his
eyes
off
celino
of
course
said
celino
calmly
scipio
he
snapped
his
fingers
to
the
horses
go
the
hound
turned
head
and
tail
lowered
and
walked
away
but
he
swung
his
long
muzzle
around
to
glance
back
at
daoud
as
he
moved
off
his
pupils
reflected
the
moonlight
like
two
silver
coins
give
me
the
jewels
you
carrying
said
daoud
of
course
said
celino
again
promptly
unbuckling
his
belt
daoud
tensed
himself
in
case
the
sicilian
should
go
for
his
dagger
but
celino
held
the
belt
up
so
that
the
twelve
unset
stones
rubies
pearls
and
amethysts
could
roll
out
of
the
hidden
pocket
into
daoud
palm
daoud
added
them
to
the
twelve
already
in
his
pouch
there
now
you
have
the
stones
back
and
now
are
you
going
to
try
to
kill
me
there
was
a
hint
of
challenge
in
that
word
if
i
had
had
all
these
jewels
at
the
inn
i
would
have
left
you
for
that
crowd
to
kill
how
could
you
be
so
stupid
as
to
involve
us
in
a
tavern
quarrel
i
am
no
man
slave
celino
growled
not
manfred
and
surely
not
yours
i
am
a
slave
that
is
what
the
very
word
mameluke
means
and
i
am
proud
to
be
a
do
you
think
celino
daoud
said
softly
that
you
are
a
better
man
than
i
i
think
myself
better
than
no
man
and
no
man
better
than
me
daoud
looked
away
gazing
up
the
river
he
noticed
a
huge
round
shape
bulking
against
the
horizon
a
fortress
of
some
kind
there
might
be
danger
from
that
direction
celino
you
and
sophia
and
i
are
a
little
army
in
the
land
of
our
enemies
an
army
can
have
only
one
leader
celino
nodded
i
know
that
but
you
must
understand
that
if
i
accept
you
as
our
leader
it
is
of
my
own
free
will
i
am
still
my
own
master
daoud
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
admiration
and
uneasiness
at
this
he
was
painfully
aware
that
among
mamelukes
a
warrior
of
celino
age
would
be
treated
with
great
respect
indeed
king
manfred
clearly
held
lorenzo
in
high
esteem
his
effort
to
save
the
old
man
had
been
noble
in
its
way
but
an
impulse
at
the
wrong
time
even
a
noble
impulse
could
mean
death
for
all
of
them
does
that
mean
you
feel
free
to
disobey
me
i
have
done
whatever
you
wanted
up
to
now
except
for
what
happened
at
the
inn
that
was
different
why
different
daoud
demanded
you
are
not
a
stupid
man
celino
why
did
you
do
such
a
stupid
thing
celino
shook
his
head
and
turned
away
angry
as
you
are
at
me
daoud
you
can
not
be
angrier
than
i
am
at
myself
if
i
had
not
intervened
that
man
angelo
ben
ezra
might
yet
be
alive
and
his
not
widowed
they
might
have
been
hurt
and
they
surely
would
have
been
robbed
but
i
do
not
think
those
tavern
louts
would
have
gone
so
far
as
to
kill
them
daoud
was
astonished
that
celino
did
not
even
defend
his
actions
any
more
than
we
meant
to
kill
any
of
those
men
daoud
agreed
but
a
man
of
your
experience
knows
that
once
the
sword
is
drawn
only
god
knows
who
will
live
or
die
yet
you
drew
your
sword
against
them
the
old
man
wandered
in
out
of
the
night
seeking
hospitality
instead
they
were
beating
him
and
they
were
going
to
take
his
donkey
and
everything
he
owned
and
cast
him
out
because
he
was
a
jew
yes
you
christians
are
very
cruel
to
jews
it
is
not
so
in
the
lands
of
islam
but
you
should
be
used
to
seeing
such
things
i
am
not
a
christian
daoud
i
am
a
jew
myself
and
that
is
why
i
went
to
that
old
man
aid
daoud
blinked
in
surprise
then
began
to
laugh
you
find
that
funny
i
am
just
as
surprised
to
find
out
that
you
are
a
jew
as
others
would
be
to
find
out
that
i
am
a
muslim
daoud
stopped
laughing
i
have
known
many
jews
in
egypt
abd
ibn
adam
sultan
baibars
personal
physician
is
a
jew
but
why
do
you
not
wear
the
required
hat
it
is
not
required
in
manfred
kingdom
and
i
would
not
wear
it
on
this
mission
any
more
than
you
would
wear
a
muslim
turban
then
celino
laughed
but
if
i
were
to
drop
my
breeches
you
would
see
the
mark
of
abraham
i
have
that
as
well
said
daoud
with
a
smile
muslims
are
also
circumcised
i
was
eleven
he
remembered
with
a
twinge
the
old
mullah
chanting
prayers
in
arabic
the
knife
whose
steel
looked
sharper
and
colder
than
any
he
had
seen
before
or
since
now
that
mark
is
all
i
have
left
of
the
religion
i
was
born
into
celino
said
what
do
you
mean
did
you
convert
to
christianity
i
told
you
i
am
not
a
christian
i
profess
no
faith
daoud
drew
back
a
man
who
had
no
faith
at
all
was
somehow
less
than
human
you
believe
in
nothing
one
of
manfred
saracen
scholars
gave
me
a
book
by
your
arab
philosopher
averroës
in
it
he
taught
that
there
are
no
spirits
no
gods
no
angels
no
human
souls
all
things
are
matter
only
that
is
what
i
believe
daoud
made
a
motion
i
have
been
taught
that
averroës
is
a
great
heretic
now
i
see
how
wise
we
are
not
to
read
him
it
was
life
that
made
me
a
nonbeliever
averroës
only
showed
me
that
there
are
learned
men
who
think
likewise
daoud
shook
his
head
baibars
would
never
allow
such
a
man
near
him
why
does
your
king
permit
you
to
have
no
religion
the
truth
of
it
is
he
thinks
as
i
do
as
his
father
emperor
frederic
did
before
him
in
the
kingdom
of
sicily
under
the
hohenstaufens
people
may
believe
as
they
please
as
long
as
they
are
discreet
about
it
of
course
king
manfred
must
pretend
to
be
a
catholic
or
all
the
hosts
of
christendom
would
fall
upon
his
kingdom
and
destroy
him
as
for
me
manfred
trusts
me
because
he
knows
i
do
not
stand
in
awe
of
the
pope
the
same
reason
he
relies
on
his
saracen
warriors
yes
daoud
thought
having
no
religion
might
make
celino
a
more
useful
companion
for
a
mission
like
this
but
how
could
daoud
trust
a
man
who
had
no
faith
in
a
higher
power
but
why
did
you
try
to
fight
for
that
old
man
look
what
you
have
done
to
us
celino
sighed
and
shook
his
head
he
was
so
much
like
my
own
father
i
could
not
help
myself
that
is
a
poor
excuse
celino
looked
steadily
into
daoud
eyes
it
may
seem
so
to
you
it
is
said
that
mamelukes
scarcely
remember
their
mothers
and
fathers
daoud
body
stiffened
with
rage
celino
words
were
a
blow
that
tore
open
an
old
wound
you
know
nothing
of
that
and
for
your
own
safety
you
had
best
not
speak
of
it
to
me
daoud
said
in
a
choked
whisper
celino
inclined
his
head
i
ask
your
forgiveness
remember
that
if
we
fail
in
this
mission
it
will
mean
great
harm
to
your
king
manfred
who
has
been
so
good
to
you
and
raised
you
so
high
daoud
said
celino
head
was
still
lowered
in
submission
you
are
right
to
remind
me
of
that
i
have
been
foolish
daoud
gripped
celino
wrist
the
sicilian
raised
his
head
and
stared
into
daoud
eyes
daoud
said
i
must
have
your
oath
that
this
will
never
happen
again
should
you
see
a
hundred
jews
having
their
throats
cut
you
will
smile
like
a
good
christian
and
declare
the
sight
pleasing
to
god
i
will
do
my
best
daoud
that
is
all
i
can
honestly
promise
you
but
i
think
it
will
be
good
enough
being
honest
as
he
puts
it
he
still
leaves
himself
room
to
defy
and
you
will
obey
my
commands
from
now
on
as
if
they
came
from
your
king
you
have
my
word
of
honor
the
honor
of
an
unbeliever
is
worth
manfred
what
kind
of
a
crazed
camel
have
you
foisted
off
on
me
here
he
was
far
across
the
sea
from
the
only
home
he
had
ever
known
in
the
midst
of
people
who
would
kill
him
in
an
instant
if
they
knew
who
he
was
and
now
he
felt
he
could
not
trust
one
of
the
few
men
he
must
depend
upon
he
felt
a
coldness
beginning
in
his
palms
and
spreading
through
his
body
as
he
wondered
what
further
calamities
like
might
lie
before
them
ix
city
that
founded
my
sophia
thought
sophia
and
david
rode
along
the
tiber
as
it
wound
its
way
through
rome
like
a
brown
serpent
looking
up
from
the
riverbank
sophia
saw
the
peaked
roofs
and
domes
of
churches
and
the
battlements
of
fortified
palaces
the
houses
of
the
common
folk
huddled
at
the
feet
of
the
hills
and
here
and
there
remnants
of
old
rome
rose
like
yellowed
tombstones
today
romans
sophia
thought
built
their
hovels
in
the
shadows
of
marble
ruins
sophia
was
impressed
only
by
the
age
of
the
place
her
own
city
the
polis
was
everything
now
that
this
place
had
been
centuries
ago
rome
had
possessed
civilization
and
had
lost
it
constantinople
had
it
still
on
a
grander
scale
at
dawn
david
party
had
reached
the
place
where
the
tiber
passed
through
crumbling
city
walls
lorenzo
and
rachel
crossed
the
river
into
the
trastevere
quarter
where
the
jews
lived
sophia
wondered
how
they
would
get
past
the
watchmen
at
the
city
gate
with
the
old
man
body
would
lorenzo
tell
a
clever
story
try
bribery
or
use
his
ghibellino
connections
or
would
he
fail
and
he
and
rachel
be
arrested
david
did
not
seem
worried
she
had
seen
his
anger
at
lorenzo
perhaps
he
hoped
to
be
rid
of
him
for
her
part
she
felt
lorenzo
was
far
more
her
friend
than
david
she
had
known
lorenzo
longer
and
he
had
always
been
kind
to
her
she
prayed
he
would
return
safely
to
them
after
finding
a
haven
for
rachel
among
the
jews
of
rome
she
and
david
had
entered
the
city
through
a
gate
on
the
east
side
of
the
tiber
without
difficulty
evidently
news
of
the
incident
at
the
inn
had
not
reached
the
roman
watch
in
the
city
she
rode
beside
david
along
the
river
east
bank
she
touched
david
shoulder
and
pointed
to
a
hilltop
that
hill
is
called
the
capitoline
she
said
at
one
time
the
whole
world
was
ruled
from
there
she
supposed
david
would
find
that
hard
to
believe
though
the
hill
was
still
impressive
with
a
cluster
of
marble
palaces
at
its
top
they
were
passing
through
one
of
the
most
crowded
parts
of
rome
on
their
left
fishermen
hauled
their
nets
out
of
the
river
throwing
flopping
fish
into
baskets
on
their
right
shops
in
the
ground
floors
of
overhanging
houses
offered
fruits
and
flowers
and
vegetables
fish
shoes
straw
rosaries
icons
relics
candles
even
at
this
early
hour
the
street
was
crowded
romans
jostled
the
horses
david
and
sophia
rode
but
they
gave
scipio
plenty
of
room
lorenzo
had
given
the
great
boarhound
a
stern
lecture
after
which
scipio
docilely
allowed
david
to
lead
him
on
a
leash
i
have
seen
two
other
great
imperial
cities
said
david
one
was
baghdad
before
the
tartars
destroyed
it
it
was
then
much
like
this
city
is
now
its
glory
shrunken
and
faded
but
still
the
center
of
our
faith
as
rome
is
the
center
of
christendom
sophia
was
taken
aback
at
his
casual
error
rome
is
the
center
of
christendom
she
said
sharply
ah
how
could
i
have
neglected
constantinople
and
the
greek
church
he
smiled
the
smile
lit
his
deeply
tanned
face
in
a
way
that
surprised
her
held
her
gaze
she
felt
a
warmth
smooth
and
brown
his
skin
you
must
never
forget
constantinople
she
admonished
him
with
a
small
smile
i
spent
a
month
in
constantinople
some
years
ago
that
was
the
other
imperial
city
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
this
made
her
feel
warmer
still
toward
him
then
his
smile
faded
your
city
too
has
suffered
at
the
hands
of
barbarians
the
franks
who
would
destroy
us
us
she
repeated
in
her
mind
he
not
a
child
of
those
frankish
barbarians
on
the
road
from
lucera
to
rome
he
had
told
her
in
a
brusque
fashion
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
someone
other
than
himself
the
story
of
his
childhood
and
how
he
came
to
be
a
mameluke
she
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
he
spoke
of
the
killing
of
his
parents
and
his
enslavement
by
the
saracens
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
blessing
but
she
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
believing
muslim
through
and
through
do
you
never
think
of
yourself
as
a
frank
david
he
smiled
again
never
and
i
hope
you
will
not
think
of
me
as
one
either
because
i
know
you
must
hate
franks
hate
franks
dread
them
was
closer
to
the
truth
last
night
when
they
fought
their
way
free
of
those
people
from
the
inn
she
had
remembered
the
terror
she
had
known
as
a
girl
in
constantinople
it
was
the
return
of
that
terror
that
had
given
her
the
strength
to
smash
a
jug
over
that
horrid
woman
head
she
was
about
to
reply
to
david
when
scipio
broke
into
loud
barking
david
frowned
at
the
sight
of
something
ahead
the
tiber
made
a
sharp
bend
and
beyond
that
on
the
opposite
bank
towered
a
huge
fortress
a
great
cylinder
of
marble
castel
sant
angelo
at
the
base
of
the
citadel
was
a
bridge
and
lorenzo
was
crossing
it
she
knew
him
even
from
this
distance
by
his
purple
cap
and
brown
cloak
sophia
had
expected
to
see
lorenzo
return
alone
it
gave
her
a
little
start
of
surprise
to
see
that
rachel
was
still
with
him
still
riding
their
spare
horse
david
angrily
muttered
something
that
sophia
guessed
must
be
an
arabic
curse
he
checked
his
horse
sophia
reined
up
her
gray
mare
and
they
sat
waiting
for
rachel
and
lorenzo
to
come
up
to
them
they
want
me
as
far
away
from
them
as
possible
rachel
said
she
climbed
down
from
her
mount
at
once
as
if
acknowledging
that
she
had
no
right
to
be
riding
it
she
looked
at
david
with
an
expression
of
appeal
this
was
the
first
time
sophia
had
gotten
a
good
look
at
rachel
the
girl
had
removed
the
scarf
that
hid
her
hair
which
was
and
hung
in
a
single
braid
down
below
her
shoulders
a
dusty
purple
traveling
cloak
enveloped
her
slight
body
her
skin
was
white
as
fine
porcelain
the
eyes
under
her
straight
black
brows
were
bright
but
sophia
could
see
fear
in
them
she
remembered
herself
ten
years
earlier
a
bewildered
terrified
orphaned
girl
in
constantinople
must
help
this
why
will
your
people
not
take
you
david
said
gruffly
they
are
afraid
said
rachel
when
we
told
them
what
happened
at
the
inn
last
night
they
said
we
had
put
them
all
in
deadly
danger
lorenzo
looked
up
from
where
he
crouched
scratching
scipio
long
jaw
and
we
had
better
get
out
of
the
city
quickly
before
the
rulers
of
rome
start
hunting
for
us
rachel
went
on
one
of
the
rabbis
took
angelo
body
and
promised
to
bury
him
at
once
that
much
they
are
willing
to
do
but
they
said
they
could
not
protect
me
if
i
were
discovered
not
only
that
but
it
would
bring
persecution
down
on
them
david
said
but
did
you
not
appear
to
be
a
boy
at
the
inn
the
people
at
the
inn
saw
a
young
person
who
could
be
boy
or
girl
said
lorenzo
the
jews
here
are
constantly
spied
upon
there
are
malshins
paid
informers
among
them
their
leaders
think
keeping
rachel
too
much
of
a
risk
and
knowing
how
many
lives
they
have
in
their
care
i
can
not
blame
them
david
glared
at
lorenzo
could
you
not
do
more
to
persuade
them
lorenzo
spread
his
hands
at
first
they
did
not
trust
me
because
they
thought
i
was
a
christian
when
i
told
them
i
am
a
jew
they
still
distrusted
me
because
i
admitted
being
from
sicily
that
must
have
made
them
suspect
that
i
am
connected
with
king
manfred
the
jews
of
rome
live
as
clients
of
the
pope
they
can
not
afford
to
get
involved
with
ghibellini
rachel
pressed
her
hands
on
david
knee
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
looking
grimly
down
at
her
i
beg
you
let
me
come
with
you
there
is
no
place
for
me
here
in
rome
there
is
no
place
for
you
where
we
are
going
he
said
gruffly
sophia
felt
herself
melting
within
as
she
saw
the
misery
on
face
swinging
her
leg
over
her
mare
back
she
slid
down
rushed
over
to
the
girl
and
put
her
arms
around
her
she
looked
up
at
david
david
please
david
looked
down
at
her
his
face
hard
as
if
carved
from
dark
wood
the
eyes
glittering
like
shards
of
glass
she
could
not
read
his
expression
can
i
know
what
is
in
the
mind
of
a
frank
turned
turk
david
got
down
from
his
horse
and
beckoned
to
sophia
and
lorenzo
they
followed
him
a
short
way
along
the
street
when
he
turned
to
face
them
sophia
saw
fury
in
his
eyes
and
her
heart
fluttered
like
a
trapped
bird
he
spoke
softly
through
tight
lips
and
his
voice
was
as
frightening
as
the
hiss
of
a
viper
i
begin
to
think
king
manfred
is
my
enemy
and
the
enemy
of
my
people
sending
the
two
of
you
with
me
on
this
journey
from
now
on
both
of
you
will
do
as
i
command
and
you
will
not
question
me
desperately
sophia
turned
to
lorenzo
can
you
not
speak
to
him
looking
down
at
the
cobblestones
lorenzo
shook
his
head
i
made
a
terrible
blunder
trying
to
help
rachel
and
her
husband
from
now
on
things
must
go
as
david
commands
if
sophia
had
been
arguing
for
herself
she
could
have
said
no
more
in
the
face
of
david
fury
but
she
looked
away
from
him
to
the
small
figure
standing
by
the
horses
and
her
anguish
for
the
child
forced
her
to
speak
but
david
what
harm
can
rachel
do
now
the
burning
gaze
was
bent
on
her
alone
we
will
be
saying
things
about
ourselves
in
orvieto
that
she
already
knows
are
not
true
he
turned
to
lorenzo
you
talk
of
the
lives
the
jewish
leaders
have
in
their
care
you
do
not
understand
you
can
not
understand
what
will
happen
to
my
people
if
i
fail
what
is
it
to
you
if
the
tartars
kill
every
man
woman
and
child
in
cairo
his
voice
was
trembling
and
sophia
realized
he
must
have
seen
sights
in
the
east
that
made
the
terror
of
the
tartars
real
to
him
as
it
could
not
be
to
her
i
owe
the
girl
nothing
david
went
on
vehemently
nothing
it
was
not
i
who
caused
this
but
a
little
girl
with
her
whole
life
before
her
hanged
or
torn
to
pieces
by
a
mob
the
thought
of
it
made
sophia
want
to
scream
at
david
she
remembered
the
awful
mindless
terror
when
she
and
alexis
ran
through
the
streets
of
constantinople
with
a
roaring
pack
of
frankish
hunting
them
last
night
she
had
relived
that
terror
when
they
fled
from
the
inn
she
thought
she
would
rather
die
herself
than
let
rachel
be
taken
by
a
mob
can
not
abandon
rachel
i
must
try
to
sway
him
is
there
any
way
i
can
touch
david
heart
course
the
same
thing
that
moves
david
she
said
years
ago
when
you
were
a
little
boy
when
the
turks
killed
your
parents
do
you
remember
how
you
felt
david
stared
at
her
so
fixed
were
his
eyes
that
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
might
draw
his
sword
and
strike
her
down
she
waited
trembling
you
have
no
right
to
speak
of
that
to
me
he
said
his
voice
was
tight
with
pain
i
know
i
have
no
right
she
said
ca
you
see
how
desperate
i
am
hope
dawned
faintly
within
her
she
had
touched
him
his
silence
stretched
on
while
the
turmoil
of
the
city
eddied
about
them
she
waited
trembling
he
spoke
he
who
taught
me
islam
said
to
me
lift
up
a
fallen
swallow
is
to
raise
up
your
heart
to
god
relief
flooded
sophia
body
she
wanted
to
weep
instead
she
felt
herself
smiling
but
david
did
not
return
her
smile
swear
that
this
girl
will
learn
nothing
of
our
mission
from
you
he
said
and
you
also
celino
swear
it
by
all
that
you
hold
most
holy
i
swear
it
by
constantinople
said
sophia
fervently
and
gladly
i
will
swear
it
on
the
lives
of
my
wife
and
my
children
said
lorenzo
i
accept
that
said
david
and
when
we
reach
orvieto
the
girl
leaves
us
even
if
she
starves
in
the
streets
i
will
accept
said
lorenzo
lest
you
later
forswear
yourselves
there
is
one
more
thing
that
will
assure
your
compliance
said
david
know
that
if
this
girl
learns
a
word
of
what
we
are
doing
she
will
die
by
my
hand
he
dropped
his
hand
to
the
unadorned
hilt
of
his
sword
sophia
felt
cold
inside
he
cared
about
one
thing
only
after
all
they
turned
back
sophia
saw
rachel
standing
by
a
shop
looking
anxiously
at
them
holding
the
gathered
reins
of
their
horses
in
both
hands
sophia
realized
that
the
girl
might
be
thinking
that
they
were
going
to
drive
her
off
and
she
hurried
to
rachel
with
a
smile
holding
out
her
arms
she
hugged
rachel
and
tentatively
fearfully
rachel
smiled
back
at
her
you
will
come
with
us
she
said
as
far
as
we
are
going
to
orvieto
you
will
have
to
leave
us
there
but
we
will
help
you
find
a
home
oh
thank
you
thank
you
rachel
cried
and
she
burst
into
tears
lorenzo
grinned
reassuringly
at
rachel
i
told
you
it
would
be
all
right
when
he
grinned
like
that
his
teeth
white
under
his
thick
black
mustache
he
reminded
sophia
of
a
large
and
satisfied
cat
rachel
looked
up
at
david
i
thank
signore
i
know
this
is
your
decision
may
i
know
the
name
of
my
benefactor
david
smiled
bitterly
benefactor
rachel
if
you
had
not
met
us
your
protector
would
still
be
alive
i
am
david
burian
a
silk
merchant
of
trebizond
i
go
to
orvieto
hoping
to
open
trade
between
trebizond
and
the
papal
states
and
i
have
hired
these
people
to
help
me
may
i
also
help
you
signore
rachel
said
i
learned
something
of
commerce
from
my
husband
i
think
david
said
looking
at
sophia
and
lorenzo
with
sour
humor
i
already
have
all
the
help
i
need
least
the
man
is
thought
sophia
can
joke
a
she
felt
encouraged
she
had
actually
been
able
to
touch
the
heart
of
this
man
whose
life
and
world
were
utterly
strange
to
her
x
there
is
so
much
water
in
this
country
thought
daoud
raindrops
sparkled
on
every
branch
and
leaf
of
the
trees
around
him
the
sky
once
more
a
bright
blue
after
the
thunderstorm
that
had
passed
over
them
was
reflected
in
water
that
still
streamed
through
the
ditches
beside
the
roadway
fortunate
that
rachel
husband
a
man
who
had
spent
many
months
of
the
year
on
the
roads
of
italy
buying
and
selling
books
in
the
jewish
communities
had
carried
a
tent
with
him
daoud
sophia
rachel
and
even
scipio
had
all
crowded
into
it
when
they
saw
the
storm
coming
the
tent
had
leaked
but
the
heat
of
the
august
afternoon
would
soon
dry
them
daoud
hoped
none
of
the
others
had
noticed
his
fear
during
the
storm
he
had
been
in
the
desert
when
lightning
crackled
in
black
clouds
and
the
wind
blew
smothering
waves
of
sand
but
the
thunderstorms
they
had
been
through
had
seemed
to
be
just
overhead
and
so
much
water
had
fallen
from
the
sky
daoud
was
sure
they
would
soon
be
drowned
it
seemed
almost
miraculous
to
him
that
he
could
emerge
from
rachel
tent
alive
and
find
the
world
outside
as
intact
as
he
had
left
it
better
than
he
left
it
because
it
was
now
washed
clean
of
dust
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
road
to
see
if
lorenzo
was
returning
from
orvieto
orvieto
across
the
valley
out
of
a
forest
rose
a
gigantic
yellow
rock
shaped
like
a
camel
hump
crowning
the
hump
a
wall
of
gray
stone
encircled
the
peaked
roofs
and
bell
towers
of
churches
the
battlements
of
palaces
and
the
roofs
of
houses
one
narrow
road
zigzagged
up
the
steep
side
of
the
great
rock
sometimes
disappearing
into
clumps
of
trees
a
white
streak
against
the
ocher
cliffs
a
city
built
on
an
almost
inaccessible
mountaintop
like
the
strongholds
of
the
hashishiyya
he
spied
a
horseman
in
purple
cap
and
brown
cloak
descending
the
road
from
the
city
celino
following
him
was
a
glittering
gilt
sedan
chair
carried
by
four
bearers
the
breeze
that
had
brought
the
storm
had
died
away
and
daoud
was
beginning
to
feel
the
heat
of
the
sun
on
the
back
of
his
neck
a
mild
sun
compared
to
that
of
egypt
even
though
this
was
the
middle
of
the
italian
summer
but
he
drew
up
his
cotton
hood
to
shade
his
head
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
rachel
and
sophia
were
in
the
clearing
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
watering
the
horses
in
a
stream
that
ran
down
the
hillside
rachel
was
nodding
eagerly
as
sophia
talked
he
hoped
she
was
not
telling
rachel
too
much
just
as
he
himself
might
have
told
sophia
too
much
he
thought
ruefully
celino
arrived
at
daoud
camp
well
ahead
of
the
sedan
chair
scipio
had
bounded
up
the
road
to
meet
his
master
and
now
licked
the
hand
that
celino
held
out
as
he
dismounted
celino
said
cardinal
ugolini
sends
this
messenger
who
may
surprise
you
when
the
sedan
chair
came
to
rest
on
the
side
of
the
road
daoud
saw
that
the
four
bearers
were
black
men
of
africa
they
wore
scarlet
vests
and
sweat
glistened
on
their
bare
arms
and
chests
sheikh
saadi
had
been
such
a
man
and
there
were
many
such
men
in
the
egyptian
army
daoud
wondered
if
these
too
were
muslims
in
the
city
of
the
pope
not
likely
two
of
the
bearers
drew
back
the
curtains
of
the
chair
and
reached
within
bejeweled
white
fingers
grasped
the
bearers
muscular
arms
and
a
turban
brocaded
with
gold
pushed
out
past
the
curtains
followed
by
a
round
body
swathed
in
silk
daoud
was
not
surprised
this
must
be
the
one
who
called
herself
morgiana
in
the
letters
to
baibars
that
came
regularly
from
italy
by
carrier
pigeon
and
ship
thought
daoud
still
clinging
to
the
bearers
the
stout
woman
pulled
herself
erect
then
she
waved
her
servants
away
with
a
flapping
of
sleeves
and
a
jangling
of
bracelets
and
squinted
at
daoud
is
it
time
said
daoud
he
spoke
in
arabic
not
yet
she
answered
in
the
same
language
but
presently
that
completed
their
prearranged
words
of
recognition
salaam
aleikum
morgiana
he
said
smiling
peace
be
to
you
he
pushed
back
his
hood
and
bowed
to
her
he
had
a
warm
sense
of
meeting
an
old
friend
he
had
read
many
of
her
reports
on
matters
of
state
in
italy
wa
aleikum
daoud
she
replied
and
peace
also
to
you
you
will
have
to
know
my
real
name
now
tilia
caballo
at
your
service
he
had
pictured
morgiana
as
a
tall
slender
woman
of
mature
years
darkly
attractive
the
real
morgiana
was
quite
different
her
eyebrows
were
thick
and
black
her
nose
a
tiny
button
between
round
red
cheeks
her
face
was
shiny
with
sweat
even
though
she
had
been
doing
nothing
but
sitting
in
a
sedan
chair
looking
at
her
spherical
body
daoud
felt
great
respect
for
the
strength
of
the
men
who
carried
her
the
silk
clinging
to
her
body
outlined
breasts
like
divan
cushions
and
her
belly
protruded
in
a
parody
of
pregnancy
could
she
truly
be
a
mistress
just
as
sultans
and
emirs
had
chief
wives
who
were
old
and
honored
and
younger
wives
for
play
perhaps
cardinal
ugolini
kept
tilia
caballo
only
as
his
official
mistress
the
clasp
on
her
turban
was
studded
with
diamonds
a
heavy
gold
necklace
spilled
down
the
broad
bare
slope
of
her
chest
from
the
necklace
dangled
a
cross
set
with
blue
and
red
jewels
gold
baibars
has
sent
her
helped
buy
the
fortune
she
he
wondered
how
much
did
baibars
really
know
about
this
woman
i
saw
cardinal
ugolini
for
a
moment
only
messer
david
said
celino
as
soon
as
he
found
out
i
was
from
you
he
insisted
that
i
go
to
this
lady
establishment
celino
speaking
the
dialect
of
sicily
uttered
the
word
stabilimento
with
a
curious
intonation
scipio
stood
with
his
forepaws
on
celino
chest
and
celino
scratched
the
hound
behind
the
ears
he
means
the
finest
house
of
pleasure
in
all
the
papal
states
said
tilia
caballo
smoothing
the
front
of
her
gown
with
a
look
naturally
his
eminence
cardinal
ugolini
can
not
risk
meeting
openly
with
you
until
i
have
seen
you
on
his
behalf
she
had
switched
from
arabic
to
an
italian
dialect
that
was
new
to
daoud
he
had
trouble
understanding
her
he
did
not
think
it
had
been
mentioned
in
her
letters
or
by
baibars
that
she
was
a
brothel
keeper
he
felt
slightly
repelled
he
wondered
if
baibars
knew
he
must
baibars
knew
everything
take
yourself
away
celino
daoud
ordered
and
tell
those
two
to
come
no
closer
he
pointed
to
the
forest
clearing
where
sophia
and
rachel
were
already
starting
toward
him
i
must
be
alone
with
madonna
tilia
yes
messere
said
celino
with
a
bow
scipio
paced
ahead
of
him
like
a
tame
lion
as
he
walked
off
we
expected
you
to
enter
orvieto
alone
said
tilia
looking
at
sophia
and
rachel
who
were
staring
back
at
her
from
across
the
road
why
this
entourage
i
expected
to
meet
with
cardinal
ugolini
at
thought
daoud
with
growing
irritation
he
set
this
woman
up
as
a
barrier
between
himself
and
me
he
explained
briefly
how
celino
sophia
and
rachel
came
to
be
traveling
with
him
tilia
gazed
at
him
with
a
falcon
piercing
stare
daoud
was
not
used
to
being
stared
at
by
a
woman
and
she
made
him
uneasy
but
he
met
her
eyes
in
silence
until
she
turned
to
her
slaves
and
made
a
dropping
gesture
with
her
hand
the
africans
immediately
squatted
in
the
grassy
clearing
where
they
had
set
tilia
chair
daoud
realized
that
he
had
not
heard
a
sound
from
them
and
suspected
they
must
have
been
made
dumb
come
tilia
took
his
arm
again
surprising
him
in
egypt
women
did
not
touch
men
they
had
just
met
but
she
owned
a
house
of
pleasure
she
was
not
a
respectable
woman
why
should
that
bother
him
he
asked
himself
he
had
spent
his
share
of
time
in
houses
of
pleasure
along
the
bhar
what
he
felt
toward
their
owners
was
mostly
gratitude
tilia
drew
daoud
with
her
into
the
thicket
along
the
hillside
stepping
gracefully
despite
her
bulk
around
shrubs
and
over
rocks
and
fallen
branches
she
led
him
away
from
the
road
and
into
a
grove
of
pine
trees
a
little
way
up
the
slope
daoud
felt
his
muscles
tightening
he
was
going
to
have
to
undergo
more
testing
before
she
would
let
him
meet
ugolini
did
they
really
think
that
baibars
would
send
a
fool
to
orvieto
spread
your
cloak
for
me
she
pointed
to
a
spot
under
an
old
pine
whose
trunk
rose
straight
and
bare
twice
the
height
of
a
man
before
the
first
branch
sprouted
daoud
unclasped
his
brown
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
thick
bed
of
brown
pine
needles
tilia
sat
down
smiled
and
patted
the
place
beside
her
a
messenger
brought
the
news
to
the
pope
yesterday
that
the
tartar
ambassadors
have
landed
at
venice
she
said
they
are
on
their
way
to
orvieto
and
should
be
here
in
a
week
or
so
they
are
well
protected
they
brought
their
own
bodyguard
which
is
now
reinforced
by
a
company
of
french
knights
and
venetian
under
a
certain
count
de
gobignon
daoud
felt
a
tingle
of
anticipation
as
he
did
when
he
was
about
to
close
with
the
enemy
in
a
battle
so
i
will
be
in
orvieto
before
them
that
is
good
yes
but
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
has
arrived
here
before
he
speaks
for
the
king
of
france
and
he
has
already
begun
to
press
the
case
for
a
tartar
alliance
before
pope
urban
he
has
arranged
for
the
tartars
and
their
guards
to
live
at
the
palace
of
the
monaldeschi
family
daoud
caught
an
intonation
in
tilia
voice
that
suggested
it
was
a
great
accomplishment
for
the
tartars
to
live
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
was
she
trying
to
discourage
him
what
is
this
monaldeschi
family
he
asked
the
oldest
and
richest
family
in
orvieto
she
said
right
now
the
capo
della
famiglia
the
head
of
the
family
is
the
contessa
elvira
di
monaldeschi
who
is
over
eighty
years
old
but
she
is
more
ruthless
and
savage
than
many
a
younger
man
almost
all
her
menfolk
have
been
killed
off
by
their
blood
enemies
the
filippeschi
and
she
has
had
many
filippeschi
killed
what
do
they
fight
about
said
daoud
who
knows
a
monaldeschi
kills
a
filippeschi
so
a
filippeschi
kills
a
monaldeschi
it
has
been
going
on
forever
tilia
went
on
what
you
must
realize
is
that
the
tartars
will
be
well
guarded
because
the
contessa
has
more
than
the
pope
and
a
very
strong
palace
he
turned
away
from
tilia
daoud
stared
out
through
the
screen
of
pine
branches
at
orvieto
sunlit
rock
platform
a
wagon
inched
its
way
up
the
narrow
road
who
is
this
french
count
who
guards
the
tartars
he
asked
count
simon
de
gobignon
he
is
very
young
and
very
rich
he
holds
huge
estates
in
france
and
numbers
his
vassals
in
the
thousands
he
is
close
to
the
french
royal
family
even
king
louis
himself
and
the
brother
charles
charles
daoud
remembered
lorenzo
saying
that
charles
coveted
the
throne
of
sicily
a
flash
of
light
caught
daoud
eye
a
party
of
helmeted
men
in
yellow
and
white
surcoats
had
come
out
of
the
main
gate
of
orvieto
formed
a
ragged
column
and
were
patrolling
along
the
base
of
the
city
wall
led
by
a
man
with
a
white
plume
on
his
helmet
who
are
those
soldiers
he
asked
tilia
leaned
forward
to
peer
through
the
trees
and
across
the
valley
then
resettled
herself
against
the
tree
trunk
pope
urban
has
two
hundred
guelfo
fighting
men
quartered
in
orvieto
in
all
honesty
daoud
call
me
david
he
interrupted
here
i
must
be
known
by
a
christian
name
well
david
i
think
you
had
best
go
quickly
back
to
egypt
what
can
one
man
do
against
the
french
royal
family
half
the
cardinals
the
pope
the
monaldeschi
and
the
tartars
themselves
he
felt
a
quick
spurt
of
anger
he
knew
as
well
as
she
did
the
odds
he
faced
why
was
she
trying
to
weaken
him
by
making
him
afraid
sent
her
to
discourage
me
it
is
he
who
is
he
felt
more
respect
for
her
coming
out
and
meeting
him
and
trying
to
influence
him
than
he
did
for
this
cardinal
ugolini
who
was
trying
to
protect
himself
he
knew
from
having
read
her
letters
that
she
was
a
shrewd
and
brave
woman
he
had
to
win
her
cooperation
there
was
only
one
way
he
might
hope
to
do
that
daoud
smiled
at
her
does
not
great
wealth
give
one
great
power
she
smiled
back
he
noticed
that
she
had
rubbed
some
kind
of
red
coloring
on
her
cheeks
to
make
herself
look
healthier
and
she
had
painted
shadows
around
her
eyes
as
egyptian
women
did
but
here
and
there
her
sweat
had
made
the
paint
run
in
rivulets
she
said
only
faith
is
more
powerful
than
money
then
here
is
power
daoud
unbuckled
his
belt
and
let
the
jewels
spill
out
of
its
hollow
interior
into
his
hand
he
heard
tilia
gasp
when
the
glittering
stones
filled
his
hand
he
dropped
them
gently
to
the
thin
woolen
cloak
he
had
spread
on
the
ground
and
shook
the
rest
out
of
the
belt
in
the
shadow
of
the
pines
the
jewels
seemed
to
give
off
their
own
light
from
their
polished
rounded
surfaces
red
and
blue
green
and
yellow
a
sapphire
a
topaz
and
a
pearl
were
each
set
in
heavy
gold
rings
the
others
were
loose
some
were
so
small
that
three
or
four
of
them
would
fit
on
the
tip
of
daoud
finger
one
a
ruby
was
the
size
of
a
whole
fingertip
there
were
too
many
of
them
to
count
quickly
but
daoud
knew
that
manfred
had
given
him
and
one
had
gone
to
equip
them
for
the
journey
sanctissima
maria
may
i
touch
them
you
are
welcome
to
he
said
smiling
but
make
sure
none
of
them
sticks
to
your
fingers
she
plucked
some
of
the
jewels
from
the
cloak
and
let
them
trickle
through
her
fingers
catching
the
light
as
they
tumbled
to
the
cloak
she
held
the
big
ruby
up
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
studied
it
turning
it
this
way
and
that
a
drop
of
god
blood
you
should
have
seen
the
single
emerald
i
traded
to
king
manfred
for
these
smaller
stones
there
was
beauty
a
few
at
a
time
these
can
be
turned
into
gold
she
looked
into
his
eyes
she
took
him
more
seriously
now
he
thought
he
was
not
just
some
strange
muslim
whose
rashness
might
get
her
killed
he
was
a
source
of
wealth
they
must
be
sold
carefully
or
their
sudden
appearance
will
be
noticed
she
said
after
all
even
the
princes
of
the
church
would
have
to
stretch
their
purses
for
these
i
have
it
in
mind
to
buy
princes
of
the
church
not
to
sell
jewelry
to
them
we
can
sell
some
of
these
gems
to
the
templars
they
have
enormous
wealth
and
they
are
very
discreet
noting
that
she
had
said
we
daoud
smiled
at
the
thought
of
those
ferocious
enemies
of
the
mamelukes
the
knights
templar
helping
to
provide
the
financing
that
would
weaken
their
foothold
in
islamic
lands
now
he
said
do
you
think
we
can
accomplish
something
to
keep
tartars
and
christians
apart
yes
something
used
wisely
these
jewels
or
their
worth
in
gold
will
gain
you
influence
among
the
men
around
the
pope
you
might
even
pry
a
few
of
the
french
cardinals
loose
from
their
loyalty
to
king
louis
daoud
began
scooping
up
the
stones
and
funneling
them
into
the
hidden
pocket
of
his
belt
you
must
help
me
to
use
them
wisely
exactly
what
do
you
have
in
mind
she
asked
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
jewels
as
they
disappeared
i
expect
cardinal
ugolini
to
take
some
of
the
gold
and
use
it
to
build
a
strong
party
in
orvieto
that
will
oppose
the
alliance
he
eyed
her
trying
to
see
into
her
heart
can
he
manage
such
a
thing
oh
adelberto
is
an
old
hand
at
intrigue
how
else
do
you
suppose
he
got
to
be
a
cardinal
indeed
he
is
the
camerlengo
for
the
college
of
cardinals
what
does
that
mean
daoud
asked
as
he
buckled
his
belt
he
acts
as
a
kind
of
chancellor
to
the
pope
making
announcements
calling
the
college
together
conducting
ceremonies
that
sort
of
thing
daoud
nodded
good
it
is
my
hope
that
he
can
use
this
money
to
draw
cardinals
and
church
officials
to
him
one
way
or
another
and
they
will
join
together
to
turn
the
pope
against
the
tartars
with
all
the
money
those
jewels
will
bring
you
can
indeed
create
such
a
faction
but
i
do
know
what
effect
it
will
have
on
the
pope
the
tartars
offer
the
pope
a
chance
to
wipe
out
islam
once
and
for
all
yes
and
then
after
that
the
tartars
will
wipe
out
christianity
daoud
said
i
can
tell
those
who
will
work
with
us
what
the
tartars
are
truly
like
i
have
seen
them
fought
against
them
i
have
seen
what
they
have
done
to
those
they
conquered
like
a
cloud
passing
over
the
sun
a
memory
of
ruined
baghdad
darkened
his
mind
tilia
eyes
opened
wide
you
intend
to
meet
and
talk
to
bishops
to
cardinals
he
touched
his
face
with
his
fingertips
this
is
why
baibars
sent
me
because
i
can
go
among
christians
as
a
christian
i
will
be
david
of
trebizond
a
silk
merchant
who
has
traveled
in
the
lands
ravaged
by
the
tartars
trebizond
he
could
see
the
doubt
in
her
face
he
must
seem
confident
to
her
he
must
not
let
her
know
that
he
himself
wondered
how
he
a
warrior
from
a
land
utterly
strange
to
these
people
could
make
the
great
ones
of
christendom
listen
to
him
and
believe
in
him
he
could
do
it
only
with
the
help
of
tilia
and
cardinal
ugolini
and
they
would
not
help
him
unless
they
believed
he
could
do
it
trebizond
is
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
black
sea
far
enough
away
that
i
am
not
likely
to
meet
anyone
in
orvieto
who
knows
anything
about
it
do
not
be
too
sure
the
pope
makes
a
point
of
seeing
people
from
everywhere
then
he
will
probably
want
to
meet
me
since
i
am
from
a
strange
and
faraway
place
her
eyes
widened
and
her
full
lips
parted
her
teeth
were
small
bright
and
widely
spaced
you
even
want
to
meet
with
the
he
knew
the
enormity
of
what
he
was
proposing
but
he
fought
down
the
doubt
that
her
evident
horror
had
aroused
in
him
he
made
himself
sound
absolutely
sure
when
he
answered
certainly
cardinal
ugolini
will
arrange
an
audience
for
me
if
the
pope
has
not
yet
made
a
decision
he
will
want
to
listen
to
one
who
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
what
these
tartars
are
i
will
tell
him
that
an
agreement
with
them
would
be
like
a
lamb
allying
itself
with
a
panther
talk
to
the
pope
how
would
you
know
how
to
behave
before
the
pope
among
my
people
madonna
i
am
not
just
a
warrior
i
stand
high
in
the
highest
councils
i
have
met
with
kings
and
great
men
of
religion
as
for
the
details
of
etiquette
of
an
audience
with
the
pope
as
a
traveler
from
trebizond
i
might
be
expected
to
make
mistakes
daoud
saw
that
her
olive
skin
had
turned
a
do
you
want
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
teams
of
horses
she
whispered
i
do
not
and
neither
does
cardinal
ugolini
we
can
not
risk
your
being
found
out
he
must
overcome
her
doubt
of
him
by
seeming
supremely
confident
he
said
then
for
your
own
protection
you
will
teach
me
everything
i
need
to
know
and
if
christians
moved
closer
to
tartars
despite
intrigue
and
persuasion
he
and
baibars
had
already
considered
more
desperate
measures
the
risk
of
failure
would
be
greater
and
the
consequences
more
dire
he
would
not
tell
tilia
about
these
more
drastic
steps
if
his
presence
and
intentions
already
frightened
her
and
ugolini
it
was
best
they
not
know
the
lengths
he
was
prepared
to
go
to
he
hoped
he
would
not
have
to
attempt
such
things
the
complexities
and
difficulties
of
making
them
happen
the
likelihood
of
things
going
disastrously
wrong
all
made
these
courses
too
daunting
if
it
be
god
will
he
would
manage
with
the
help
of
such
allies
as
he
found
in
orvieto
to
oppose
and
obstruct
and
delay
the
alliance
until
the
project
died
of
old
age
or
the
tartar
ambassadors
themselves
died
fights
for
baibars
had
told
him
tartar
empire
is
beginning
to
break
apart
and
the
christians
are
losing
their
eagerness
for
crusading
only
delay
this
alliance
long
enough
and
their
opportunity
to
destroy
us
will
be
tilia
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
help
me
up
my
legs
are
getting
cramped
i
feel
hungry
do
you
have
anything
to
eat
he
was
not
surprised
that
she
asked
for
food
mustapha
the
chief
eunuch
of
baibars
harem
was
monstrously
fat
and
was
always
eating
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
pulled
her
up
the
cross
on
her
bosom
swung
and
flashed
the
top
of
her
head
came
only
to
the
middle
of
his
chest
but
he
suspected
that
she
weighed
as
much
or
more
than
he
did
she
smiled
at
him
you
are
strong
and
you
move
like
a
warrior
ignoring
the
flattery
he
said
sophia
has
bread
and
cheese
that
we
bought
at
a
village
called
bagnioregio
and
some
red
wine
to
wash
it
down
tilia
laughed
bagnioregio
then
you
must
have
passed
near
the
ruins
of
ferento
the
town
that
was
destroyed
for
the
heresy
of
displaying
a
statue
of
christ
on
the
cross
with
open
eyes
what
i
saw
no
ruins
open
eyes
the
ruins
are
off
the
road
but
that
will
give
you
an
idea
of
how
careful
one
must
be
where
religion
is
concerned
i
can
not
imagine
that
anyone
makes
decent
wine
in
bagnioregio
there
is
another
town
near
here
montefiascone
where
they
make
the
best
wine
in
the
world
wait
until
you
taste
that
i
drink
wine
only
to
deceive
christians
he
said
gruffly
i
do
not
like
it
let
us
finish
this
conversation
before
you
refresh
yourself
i
do
not
want
those
two
to
know
any
more
than
i
tell
them
annoyance
flickered
in
her
face
she
was
not
used
to
being
denied
daoud
thought
but
she
shrugged
i
presume
you
plan
to
use
that
beautiful
woman
who
travels
with
you
as
bait
to
win
over
some
of
the
churchmen
to
daoud
surprise
the
thought
pained
him
she
is
a
skilled
courtesan
and
was
manfred
mistress
he
said
and
before
that
king
manfred
told
me
she
was
a
favorite
of
the
emperor
of
constantinople
we
will
want
to
keep
her
in
reserve
i
have
in
mind
that
she
could
live
with
the
cardinal
pose
as
his
niece
hm
and
the
other
girl
she
is
very
pretty
and
very
young
the
older
and
more
powerful
churchmen
are
the
more
they
are
drawn
to
youth
we
owe
rachel
a
debt
we
have
promised
to
find
a
home
for
her
among
the
jews
of
orvieto
oh
is
she
a
jew
but
there
are
no
jews
in
orvieto
somewhere
nearby
then
the
nearest
jews
live
in
rome
rome
where
the
jews
had
already
turned
rachel
away
she
can
not
go
to
rome
well
the
girl
would
find
working
for
me
far
more
rewarding
than
living
on
charity
i
am
sure
of
it
said
daoud
but
a
dark
memory
from
long
ago
rose
to
trouble
him
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
hers
you
would
not
force
her
into
whoring
would
you
tilia
pressed
her
hand
to
her
bosom
in
mock
horror
force
women
to
be
accepted
into
the
family
of
tilia
caballo
terrible
thing
to
do
to
the
child
but
it
would
solve
my
thought
david
already
must
be
aware
that
sophia
and
lorenzo
and
i
are
involved
together
in
some
secret
enterprise
it
would
be
best
to
keep
her
where
we
can
watch
for
the
time
being
rachel
will
stay
with
us
at
the
cardinal
mansion
serving
sophia
as
her
maid
he
said
tilia
looked
up
at
him
startled
you
intend
to
live
with
the
cardinal
her
surprise
in
turn
startled
daoud
but
then
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
too
firmly
fixed
upon
him
and
knew
that
she
was
dissembling
as
morgiana
did
you
not
approve
this
arrangement
with
my
lord
the
sultan
she
shrugged
that
was
when
we
thought
you
were
coming
alone
sophia
and
lorenzo
will
be
of
great
help
to
us
we
will
give
it
out
that
i
am
the
cardinal
guest
lorenzo
will
be
my
servant
giancarlo
and
sophia
will
be
the
cardinal
niece
hm
tilia
frowned
i
am
hungry
let
me
sample
the
delicacies
your
greek
woman
bought
in
bagnioregio
then
i
will
go
back
to
the
city
and
send
word
to
the
cardinal
of
what
you
have
told
me
daoud
heard
the
false
note
in
her
voice
and
bristled
with
suspicion
you
would
keep
me
waiting
out
here
while
you
warn
him
of
what
a
danger
i
am
to
i
will
tell
him
everything
myself
her
eyes
clouded
over
the
cardinal
will
send
for
you
when
he
has
heard
my
report
great
god
woman
daoud
voice
rasped
in
his
anger
do
you
expect
me
to
wait
out
here
until
the
tartars
come
to
orvieto
i
am
sent
by
the
sultan
i
bring
great
wealth
to
you
and
your
master
i
am
fighting
for
my
faith
i
will
not
tilia
patted
his
arm
placatingly
look
here
daoud
in
all
honesty
cardinal
ugolini
is
terrified
when
he
first
got
baibars
message
about
you
he
wept
for
hours
cursing
himself
over
and
over
for
a
fool
imagine
the
outrage
if
the
christians
were
to
discover
that
a
muslim
agent
has
come
so
close
to
their
pope
the
cardinal
would
never
have
taken
the
first
denaro
picciolo
from
your
sultan
if
he
had
ever
known
that
it
would
lead
to
this
a
turk
at
his
door
demanding
his
help
in
a
plot
against
the
pope
i
am
not
at
his
door
said
daoud
pointedly
no
and
before
you
arrive
there
you
must
give
me
time
to
assure
him
that
you
know
what
you
are
doing
that
you
do
not
look
anything
like
a
turk
and
above
all
that
you
bring
him
such
great
wealth
as
to
make
the
risk
worthwhile
if
you
just
appear
at
his
palace
when
he
has
insisted
that
you
wait
here
it
might
throw
him
into
a
panic
he
might
do
something
very
foolish
anger
flared
up
in
him
she
was
obstructing
him
and
threatening
him
and
he
had
had
enough
means
he
might
expose
me
or
order
his
to
kill
me
this
is
manfred
indecision
all
over
he
seized
tilia
arm
his
fingers
sinking
into
soft
flesh
under
her
silk
sleeve
i
am
going
to
the
cardinal
with
my
party
and
you
will
equip
me
with
a
message
for
him
telling
him
you
feel
assured
it
is
safe
for
him
to
admit
us
she
stared
up
at
him
expressionless
for
a
long
time
he
sensed
that
she
was
trying
to
see
into
his
heart
to
weigh
his
will
no
she
said
you
are
not
going
now
first
his
grip
on
her
arm
tightened
and
in
his
anger
he
was
about
to
shake
her
when
her
hand
darted
to
lift
the
pectoral
cross
from
her
breast
her
thumb
pressed
a
dark
red
carbuncle
between
the
arms
and
a
thin
blade
sprang
out
of
the
shaft
please
notice
that
the
cross
is
attached
to
my
neck
by
a
chain
david
i
can
not
hurt
you
unless
you
come
too
close
to
me
i
have
no
wish
to
attack
you
there
is
asp
venom
on
the
blade
by
the
way
his
anger
turned
against
himself
it
was
foolish
to
try
violence
on
a
woman
like
this
had
he
not
told
himself
he
could
not
force
tilia
and
ugolini
to
do
anything
that
he
must
persuade
them
woman
herself
is
as
dangerous
as
an
asp
but
i
need
he
let
go
of
her
arm
pardon
my
crudity
madama
tilia
pointed
her
blade
straight
up
and
pressed
another
jewel
in
the
cross
the
blade
dropped
back
into
the
shaft
i
do
not
mind
crudity
she
said
but
i
do
not
like
to
be
manhandled
she
smiled
slyly
unless
i
invited
it
i
had
already
made
my
mind
up
before
you
laid
violent
hands
on
me
that
i
would
agree
to
your
going
at
once
to
the
cardinal
i
have
decided
that
you
may
be
able
to
accomplish
what
you
set
out
to
do
without
getting
us
all
killed
you
are
brave
and
intelligent
but
you
know
how
to
bargain
too
you
know
when
to
yield
and
you
know
when
to
stand
your
ground
daoud
felt
pleasure
at
her
compliments
but
even
more
pleasure
that
she
was
going
to
cooperate
with
him
then
why
did
you
just
say
we
would
not
be
going
to
the
cardinal
i
was
about
to
add
that
first
you
feed
me
bread
and
cheese
and
the
execrable
wine
of
bagnioregio
i
give
you
a
message
that
will
get
you
into
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
daoud
laughed
that
tilia
had
yielded
was
a
great
relief
and
she
was
both
witty
and
dangerous
a
combination
he
admired
xi
simon
was
surprised
at
how
young
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
looked
the
man
who
stood
with
him
in
a
vineyard
on
the
road
to
orvieto
had
a
long
face
and
glossy
black
hair
that
fell
in
waves
to
his
shoulders
if
his
scalp
was
shaved
in
a
clerical
tonsure
his
red
velvet
cap
covered
it
his
handsome
violet
silk
tunic
reminded
simon
that
his
own
surcoat
was
and
that
thierry
had
not
polished
his
mail
in
days
de
verceuil
tossed
away
the
cluster
of
pale
green
grapes
he
had
been
nibbling
and
spoke
suddenly
count
a
report
has
reached
me
that
you
spoke
rudely
to
the
doge
of
venice
his
booming
bass
voice
sounded
as
if
it
were
emerging
from
the
depths
of
a
tomb
you
do
realize
that
your
actions
reflect
on
the
crown
of
france
he
thrust
his
face
into
simon
as
he
spoke
which
made
simon
involuntarily
draw
back
de
verceuil
was
one
of
the
few
men
simon
had
ever
met
who
matched
his
own
unusual
height
simon
felt
his
face
grow
hot
yes
your
eminence
and
how
could
you
dismiss
the
trovatore
sordello
from
the
post
to
which
count
charles
himself
appointed
him
if
sordello
had
stayed
with
us
the
tartars
might
have
taken
such
offense
as
to
go
back
to
outremer
do
not
be
absurd
would
they
abandon
a
mission
of
such
importance
because
of
a
tavern
brawl
simon
felt
shame
but
deeper
than
that
resentment
he
was
the
count
de
gobignon
and
not
since
he
was
a
child
had
anyone
chastised
him
like
this
he
heard
a
rustling
as
someone
came
down
the
row
of
vines
where
they
were
standing
he
turned
to
see
friar
mathieu
and
hoped
he
was
about
to
be
rescued
after
the
franciscan
had
humbly
greeted
the
cardinal
and
kissed
his
sapphire
ring
he
said
i
must
tell
your
eminence
that
what
happened
was
not
a
mere
tavern
brawl
sordello
stabbed
and
nearly
killed
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
armenia
an
important
ally
of
the
tartars
de
verceuil
stared
at
friar
mathieu
the
cardinal
had
a
mouth
so
small
it
looked
quite
out
of
place
below
his
large
nose
and
above
his
large
chin
a
mean
mouth
simon
thought
your
opinion
does
not
interest
me
de
verceuil
said
i
can
not
imagine
why
king
louis
trusted
a
to
conduct
diplomacy
with
the
empire
of
tartary
the
resentment
simon
had
felt
at
the
cardinal
harsh
speech
at
his
expense
now
flared
up
in
anger
am
young
and
i
do
make
simon
thought
cardinal
or
not
this
man
has
no
right
to
stand
there
in
his
velvet
and
satin
and
jewels
and
sneer
at
this
fine
old
man
no
right
at
but
the
old
friar
merely
stroked
his
white
beard
with
a
wry
smile
and
said
i
said
that
very
thing
to
him
myself
when
he
ordered
me
to
go
still
angry
simon
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
since
your
eminence
feels
i
have
embarrassed
the
king
and
displeased
the
count
of
anjou
there
is
only
one
course
open
to
me
i
will
resign
my
command
of
the
ambassadors
guards
simon
stared
into
de
verceuil
eyes
and
the
cardinal
eyelids
fluttered
in
the
silence
simon
heard
a
blackbird
calling
in
nearby
olive
trees
never
wanted
to
come
here
i
let
uncle
charles
talk
me
into
it
i
do
not
mind
the
danger
and
it
would
be
exciting
to
outguess
a
hidden
enemy
who
is
trying
to
murder
the
tartars
but
i
can
not
endure
the
way
this
man
humiliates
me
and
my
friends
i
will
go
back
to
gobignon
you
must
not
let
a
bit
of
fatherly
correction
wound
you
so
deeply
count
said
the
cardinal
his
voice
still
deep
and
dirgelike
but
no
longer
full
of
scorn
i
would
never
suggest
the
count
of
anjou
had
made
a
mistake
in
choosing
you
for
this
post
what
a
disgusting
thought
but
simon
could
see
that
his
resigning
worried
de
verceuil
uncle
charles
wanted
simon
to
guard
the
ambassadors
just
as
he
had
wanted
sordello
to
head
the
archers
he
had
his
reasons
and
de
verceuil
did
not
want
to
cross
charles
friar
mathieu
laughed
gently
and
patted
simon
on
the
shoulder
if
you
please
be
kind
enough
to
change
your
mind
about
resigning
all
of
us
are
aware
that
you
have
carried
out
the
task
with
intelligence
and
zeal
is
that
not
right
your
eminence
of
course
said
de
verceuil
his
mouth
puckered
and
sour
count
i
would
have
you
present
these
tartar
dignitaries
to
me
i
will
be
happy
to
interpret
for
you
your
eminence
said
friar
mathieu
de
verceuil
did
not
answer
him
as
they
crossed
the
vineyard
the
cardinal
stretched
out
his
long
arm
and
said
i
have
brought
musicians
jongleurs
senators
of
orvieto
two
archbishops
six
bishops
an
abbot
and
many
monsignors
and
priests
a
long
line
of
men
stretched
down
the
road
into
the
nearby
woods
most
of
them
wore
various
shades
of
red
a
few
were
in
or
blue
the
points
of
long
spears
flashed
in
the
sunlight
banners
with
fringes
of
gold
and
silver
swung
at
the
tops
of
poles
seeking
protection
from
the
heat
men
walked
horses
in
the
shade
of
the
woods
beyond
the
treetops
rose
a
distant
pedestal
of
rock
crowned
by
a
city
an
astonishing
sight
orvieto
the
holy
father
will
be
meeting
us
at
the
cathedral
and
will
say
a
special
mass
of
thanksgiving
for
the
safe
arrival
of
the
ambassadors
said
de
verceuil
i
want
the
entry
of
the
tartars
into
orvieto
to
impress
both
the
tartars
themselves
and
the
pope
and
his
courtiers
monsters
cannibals
rotten
apples
pears
and
onions
chunks
of
moldy
bread
flew
through
the
air
small
stones
that
did
not
injure
but
stung
and
worse
the
shouts
and
missiles
came
from
both
sides
of
the
street
but
always
when
simon
was
looking
the
other
way
so
he
could
not
see
his
assailants
the
people
crowded
in
front
of
the
shops
were
mostly
young
men
but
women
and
children
were
scattered
among
them
they
wore
the
dull
grayish
and
brownish
garments
of
workers
and
peasants
the
windows
behind
them
were
shuttered
and
the
doors
were
closed
tight
that
was
a
sure
sign
simon
knew
from
his
paris
student
days
that
the
shopkeepers
expected
trouble
from
the
porta
maggiore
the
main
gate
where
they
had
entered
the
street
curved
toward
the
south
side
of
the
town
though
the
upper
stories
of
many
houses
overshadowed
the
street
there
was
room
enough
for
the
procession
to
move
along
four
horses
abreast
and
for
the
unruly
people
to
gather
on
either
side
approaching
the
south
wall
of
the
city
the
street
made
a
sharp
bend
to
the
left
and
simon
had
lost
sight
of
the
tartar
emissaries
behind
who
were
a
mistake
being
carried
in
an
open
sedan
chair
were
they
being
pelted
with
garbage
why
were
the
people
of
orvieto
doing
this
true
everyone
in
christendom
had
heard
wild
tales
of
the
tartars
that
they
were
monsters
with
heads
that
they
bit
off
the
breasts
of
women
that
they
stank
so
abominably
they
overcame
whole
armies
just
with
their
smell
that
they
were
determined
to
kill
or
enslave
everyone
on
earth
there
were
churches
where
people
prayed
every
sunday
to
be
delivered
from
the
fury
of
the
tartars
but
it
had
been
over
twenty
years
since
the
tartars
had
invaded
europe
and
even
then
they
had
come
no
farther
than
poland
and
hungary
why
should
these
people
of
orvieto
turn
so
violently
against
them
now
when
they
came
in
peace
undoubtedly
someone
was
stirring
them
up
de
verceuil
and
his
simon
thought
should
be
with
the
ambassadors
if
someone
wants
to
kill
them
this
would
be
a
perfect
he
tugged
on
the
reins
of
his
palfrey
pulling
her
head
around
make
way
he
shouted
spurring
his
horse
back
the
way
he
had
come
with
spears
and
crossbows
cursed
at
him
in
various
italian
dialects
but
they
opened
a
path
pushing
back
the
people
thierry
rode
a
small
horse
in
simon
wake
imps
of
satan
came
a
shout
from
the
crowd
the
tartars
are
devils
simon
scanned
the
faces
below
him
some
looked
angry
some
frightened
many
bewildered
no
one
looked
happy
the
cardinal
hope
for
an
impressive
entry
into
orvieto
had
been
quite
dashed
and
simon
felt
a
sneaking
pleasure
at
that
passing
the
corner
where
the
procession
had
turned
he
saw
again
a
building
he
had
passed
earlier
a
formidable
cube
of
yellow
stone
with
slotted
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
iron
bars
over
the
wider
upper
windows
there
is
a
man
who
looks
he
was
standing
in
sunlight
leaning
out
from
the
square
guelfo
battlements
on
the
roof
of
the
big
building
his
hair
was
the
color
of
brass
his
skin
a
smooth
brown
such
as
simon
had
seen
on
pilgrims
newly
returned
from
the
crusader
strongholds
in
outremer
the
blond
man
gazed
down
on
the
jostling
shouting
crowd
smiling
faintly
as
simon
rode
past
him
their
eyes
met
simon
was
startled
by
the
intensity
of
the
other
gaze
it
was
as
if
a
wordless
message
had
crossed
the
space
between
them
a
challenge
but
then
the
blond
man
looked
away
the
tartar
ambassadors
seated
side
by
side
in
a
large
sedan
chair
were
farther
up
the
street
here
simon
noticed
with
relief
the
crowd
had
fallen
quiet
perhaps
curiosity
about
the
tartars
with
their
round
brown
faces
and
robes
had
overcome
whatever
had
roused
these
people
against
them
then
too
the
tartars
were
surrounded
by
their
armenians
marching
on
foot
curved
swords
drawn
as
well
as
by
simon
knights
on
horseback
and
venetian
crossbowmen
the
bows
simon
noticed
were
loaded
and
drawn
who
had
ordered
that
de
verceuil
on
a
huge
black
horse
no
palfrey
this
but
a
powerful
charger
rode
up
to
simon
why
did
you
not
remain
in
the
forefront
what
is
going
on
up
ahead
without
trying
to
defend
himself
simon
described
the
disturbance
could
you
not
control
the
rabble
de
verceuil
growled
and
turned
to
take
a
position
beside
the
tartars
sedan
chair
simon
face
burned
and
his
hands
trembled
as
he
stared
after
de
verceuil
when
they
passed
the
yellow
stone
building
simon
looked
up
and
saw
the
blond
man
still
there
on
the
roof
the
man
was
staring
down
at
the
tartars
with
that
same
burning
look
he
had
thrown
at
simon
but
there
were
no
weapons
in
the
hands
that
gripped
the
battlements
simon
heard
a
slapping
sound
and
an
angry
cry
he
turned
to
see
de
verceuil
his
right
cheek
smeared
brown
death
someone
threw
shit
at
him
and
hit
him
right
in
the
the
cardinal
his
face
distorted
as
if
he
were
about
to
vomit
was
staring
at
the
stained
hand
with
which
he
had
just
wiped
his
cheek
there
was
laughter
from
the
crowd
mixed
with
angry
cries
of
bestioni
creatures
from
hell
for
an
instant
simon
felt
laughter
bubbling
up
to
his
lips
but
cold
horror
swept
all
amusement
away
as
he
sensed
what
was
about
to
happen
de
verceuil
turned
to
the
nearest
crossbowmen
who
had
not
suppressed
their
own
smiles
shoot
he
shouted
shoot
whoever
did
that
the
smiles
remained
fixed
on
the
faces
of
the
venetians
as
three
of
them
aimed
their
crossbows
at
the
crowd
they
did
not
hesitate
this
was
not
their
city
these
were
not
their
people
they
were
fighting
men
who
did
as
they
were
ordered
people
screamed
and
shrank
back
against
the
shuttered
doors
and
windows
three
loud
snaps
of
the
bowstrings
came
at
the
same
moment
as
cry
of
no
he
shouted
without
thinking
and
was
surprised
to
hear
his
own
voice
his
cry
echoed
in
a
sudden
and
terrible
quiet
screams
of
agony
immediately
followed
people
darted
away
from
the
place
where
the
crossbowmen
had
aimed
leaving
that
part
of
the
street
empty
empty
save
for
three
people
two
of
them
screamed
one
was
silent
a
young
man
who
half
sat
half
lay
against
the
stone
wall
of
a
house
blood
was
pouring
out
of
his
mouth
and
more
blood
was
running
from
a
hole
in
his
chest
simon
saw
that
the
blood
was
coming
in
a
steady
stream
not
in
rhythmic
spurts
which
meant
the
fellow
heart
had
stopped
a
glance
at
the
white
face
told
simon
the
dead
youth
could
be
no
more
than
sixteen
beside
the
boy
a
woman
knelt
and
wept
she
was
plump
and
perhaps
his
mother
her
white
linen
tunic
was
bloodied
he
did
nothing
she
cried
oh
jesus
mary
he
did
nothing
there
was
a
plea
in
her
voice
as
if
she
might
bring
the
boy
back
to
life
if
only
she
could
persuade
people
of
his
innocence
the
other
cries
came
from
a
man
who
stood
about
a
yard
from
the
dead
boy
the
bolt
had
gone
through
his
left
shoulder
just
above
the
armpit
and
pinned
him
to
the
oaken
post
of
a
doorway
he
wanted
to
fall
but
he
had
to
stand
or
suffer
unbearable
pain
help
me
he
begged
casting
eyes
right
and
left
help
me
simon
jumped
down
from
his
horse
throwing
the
reins
to
thierry
and
ran
to
the
man
he
put
his
left
hand
on
the
chest
and
pulled
at
the
flaring
end
of
the
quarrel
with
his
right
he
could
not
move
it
the
bolt
was
buried
too
deeply
in
the
wood
the
man
forehead
fell
against
shoulder
and
he
was
silent
simon
hoped
he
had
fainted
now
simon
saw
where
the
third
bolt
had
gone
six
inches
of
it
half
its
length
was
buried
in
a
wall
a
few
feet
to
simon
right
the
wall
was
made
of
the
same
stone
orvieto
was
built
on
the
crossbow
bolt
in
the
man
shoulder
was
thick
and
made
of
hard
wood
simon
had
nothing
that
would
cut
the
man
loose
without
hurting
him
even
more
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
it
was
quite
empty
now
except
for
a
few
people
watching
from
a
distance
the
procession
had
gone
on
he
glanced
up
and
saw
that
the
blond
man
had
left
his
place
on
the
roof
friar
mathieu
knelt
beside
the
dead
young
man
one
hand
moving
in
blessing
the
other
resting
on
the
shoulder
of
the
weeping
woman
de
pirenne
and
thierry
both
mounted
the
equerry
holding
simon
horse
looked
at
him
uncertainly
go
alain
said
simon
impatiently
stay
with
the
tartars
he
himself
was
neglecting
his
duty
he
thought
as
de
pirenne
galloped
off
but
now
that
he
was
trying
to
help
this
poor
devil
he
could
not
abandon
him
can
i
do
anything
monseigneur
thierry
asked
as
simon
was
about
to
answer
he
saw
a
man
wearing
a
carpenter
apron
messere
can
you
bring
a
saw
he
called
hurry
it
seemed
hours
before
the
man
returned
with
a
small
saw
with
a
pointed
end
and
widely
spaced
teeth
he
held
it
out
to
simon
simon
wanted
to
shout
at
the
carpenter
but
he
took
a
grip
on
himself
and
said
patiently
you
are
bound
to
be
better
at
sawing
than
i
per
favore
cut
away
the
end
of
the
crossbow
bolt
so
we
can
free
this
man
gingerly
at
first
then
working
with
a
will
the
carpenter
sawed
off
the
flaring
end
of
the
bolt
with
its
thin
wooden
vanes
the
pinned
man
awoke
and
was
sobbing
and
groaning
once
the
protruding
part
of
the
bolt
was
sawed
away
simon
took
a
deep
breath
wrapped
his
arms
around
the
sobbing
man
and
pulled
him
away
from
the
wall
the
man
screamed
so
loudly
that
simon
ears
rang
then
the
man
sagged
to
the
ground
blood
flowed
from
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
soaking
his
tunic
blood
coated
the
stump
of
the
bolt
still
stuck
in
the
door
post
simon
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
the
wounded
man
a
pool
of
bright
red
widened
rapidly
on
the
flat
paving
stones
what
do
i
do
with
him
i
must
get
back
to
my
he
spoke
with
the
carpenter
press
your
hand
on
the
wound
hard
that
will
slow
the
bleeding
simon
took
the
man
hand
and
put
it
on
the
hole
the
crossbow
bolt
had
made
here
let
me
do
that
friar
mathieu
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
hurt
man
his
hand
covering
the
wound
messere
he
said
to
the
carpenter
ride
my
donkey
to
the
hospital
of
the
franciscans
tell
them
there
is
a
man
badly
hurt
here
and
friar
mathieu
says
they
are
to
send
brothers
to
take
him
for
treatment
simon
stood
up
slowly
as
the
carpenter
climbed
on
mathieu
donkey
it
is
not
safe
for
you
to
stay
here
he
said
to
friar
mathieu
the
people
know
you
were
part
of
the
procession
and
may
blame
you
for
what
happened
mathieu
shook
his
head
no
one
will
hurt
me
go
along
now
simon
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
spurred
his
palfrey
to
a
trot
thierry
rode
beside
him
those
two
did
throw
anything
thierry
said
of
course
not
simon
wondered
if
de
verceuil
cared
that
the
venetians
had
shot
two
innocent
men
when
simon
caught
up
with
the
procession
de
verceuil
was
still
furiously
scrubbing
his
face
with
his
pale
violet
cloak
if
you
had
done
something
sooner
about
the
rioting
this
outrage
would
not
have
happened
to
me
he
said
a
quaver
of
anger
in
his
deep
voice
help
thought
simon
could
easily
grow
to
hate
him
cardinal
or
word
of
the
shootings
must
have
spread
through
the
city
simon
thought
because
the
twisting
street
leading
to
the
cathedral
was
nearly
empty
but
the
piazza
in
front
of
orvieto
cathedral
of
san
giovenale
was
packed
with
people
simon
eye
was
immediately
drawn
to
the
top
of
the
cathedral
steps
there
stood
a
man
wearing
a
red
mantle
over
white
robes
glittering
with
gold
ornament
on
his
head
a
tall
white
miter
embroidered
with
a
red
and
gold
cross
in
his
hand
a
great
golden
shepherd
crook
at
least
seven
feet
tall
simon
mouth
fell
open
and
he
held
his
breath
the
ruler
of
the
whole
catholic
church
the
world
over
the
chosen
of
god
the
anointed
of
christ
the
heir
of
saint
peter
his
holiness
urban
iv
the
pope
himself
simon
felt
almost
as
much
awe
as
he
had
that
day
in
paris
when
king
louis
had
let
him
kiss
the
crown
of
thorns
lucky
i
am
to
be
here
and
see
this
man
whom
most
christians
never
see
it
is
close
as
one
can
come
to
seeing
jesus
christ
it
looked
to
simon
as
if
the
holy
father
were
glowing
with
a
supernatural
light
to
his
left
and
his
right
stood
a
dozen
or
more
men
in
bright
red
robes
and
red
hats
with
long
red
tassels
dangling
down
to
their
shoulders
the
cardinals
the
princes
of
the
church
simon
wondered
if
the
tartars
realized
what
honor
this
did
them
as
soon
as
their
sedan
chair
was
set
before
the
pope
the
two
short
brown
men
stepped
out
of
it
knelt
and
pressed
their
foreheads
to
the
cobblestones
they
stayed
that
way
until
the
pope
gestured
to
de
verceuil
who
bent
and
touched
them
on
the
shoulder
and
raised
them
up
the
pope
turned
and
followed
by
the
tartars
and
then
the
cardinals
proceeded
into
the
cathedral
for
this
meeting
to
succeed
a
papal
mass
was
the
best
possible
beginning
so
many
people
were
ahead
of
simon
that
friar
mathieu
caught
up
with
him
before
he
was
able
to
enter
the
door
of
the
cathedral
what
do
you
think
stirred
up
the
crowd
like
that
simon
asked
as
they
pushed
through
the
people
standing
in
the
nave
of
the
church
in
the
cities
of
italy
the
mob
is
always
either
furious
or
ecstatic
said
friar
mathieu
but
to
defile
a
cardinal
simon
said
that
would
never
happen
in
france
italians
do
not
reverence
the
clergy
as
much
as
frenchmen
do
the
franciscan
said
with
a
little
smile
they
have
had
to
put
up
with
the
princes
of
the
church
for
so
long
that
they
are
a
good
deal
less
awed
by
them
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
was
ablaze
with
the
light
of
a
thousand
candles
but
simon
was
not
impressed
by
the
windows
which
were
small
and
narrow
and
filled
with
glass
this
was
an
old
church
he
thought
remembering
the
huge
windows
of
glass
in
the
newer
cathedrals
of
france
the
crowd
was
so
tightly
packed
that
simon
and
friar
mathieu
could
not
get
to
the
front
of
the
nave
where
chairs
had
been
set
before
the
altar
for
dignitaries
they
had
to
be
content
with
standing
halfway
down
the
length
of
the
church
simon
thought
wryly
that
he
was
getting
used
to
being
pushed
into
the
background
perhaps
he
was
accepting
it
too
easily
pope
urban
his
white
hair
uncovered
had
raised
high
the
round
wafer
of
bread
for
the
consecration
of
the
mass
when
an
angry
shout
echoed
through
the
cathedral
a
chill
went
through
simon
body
cold
as
a
knife
blade
using
his
shoulder
as
a
wedge
he
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
toward
the
source
of
the
sound
near
the
front
of
the
church
ex
tartari
furiosi
the
man
was
shouting
in
latin
libera
nos
domine
the
fury
of
the
tartars
lord
deliver
us
cries
of
dismay
rang
out
near
the
disturbance
and
people
began
shouting
in
italian
stand
aside
let
me
through
simon
shouted
if
this
were
an
assassin
reverence
for
the
mass
even
for
the
pope
must
be
set
aside
again
and
again
the
shout
rose
ex
tartari
furiosi
it
was
harder
to
move
through
the
crowd
people
were
struggling
to
get
away
from
the
man
making
the
uproar
simon
stopped
shoved
men
right
and
left
to
make
room
and
pulled
his
scimitar
from
his
scabbard
people
around
him
turned
at
the
unmistakable
rasp
of
steel
on
leather
a
sound
that
so
often
preceded
sudden
death
they
saw
the
saracen
sword
in
simon
hands
and
drew
back
as
simon
hoped
more
people
noticed
and
fell
over
one
another
trying
to
get
out
of
his
way
like
moses
rod
parting
the
red
sea
simon
scimitar
opened
a
path
for
him
simon
saw
a
young
man
with
a
tangled
mass
of
brown
hair
whipping
about
his
face
and
a
brown
beard
that
spread
over
his
chest
he
was
big
and
and
he
wore
a
plain
white
robe
ragged
and
gray
with
dirt
and
sandals
in
one
hand
he
held
a
dagger
of
jesus
he
must
have
come
here
to
kill
the
terrified
people
had
opened
a
circle
around
the
man
and
as
he
moved
toward
the
front
of
the
cathedral
the
open
space
moved
with
him
stop
simon
cried
baring
teeth
in
a
snarl
the
man
swiveled
his
shaggy
head
toward
simon
then
immediately
rushed
at
him
simon
thought
a
hollow
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
crouched
holding
his
sword
out
before
him
diagonally
across
his
chest
do
not
kill
him
boomed
a
deep
voice
that
simon
recognized
as
de
verceuil
the
man
with
the
dagger
hesitated
now
just
out
of
reach
of
sword
i
to
risk
my
life
to
keep
this
madman
alive
but
de
verceuil
demand
made
sense
they
must
try
to
find
out
who
sent
the
man
simon
took
a
deep
breath
he
had
practiced
sword
fighting
innumerable
times
but
only
twice
in
his
life
had
he
come
up
against
an
armed
man
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
said
he
was
willing
to
kill
this
is
no
different
from
he
told
himself
he
feinted
to
the
man
left
then
jumped
forward
lifting
his
sword
high
and
bringing
the
flat
of
it
down
with
all
his
strength
on
the
hand
that
held
the
dagger
the
dagger
tumbled
through
the
air
simon
saw
at
once
that
the
man
had
no
martial
skill
the
madman
darted
forward
in
a
crouch
to
retrieve
his
dagger
and
as
he
did
so
simon
kicked
him
in
the
chin
the
thick
beard
protected
the
chin
from
the
full
force
of
simon
pointed
leather
boot
but
he
staggered
before
the
bearded
man
recovered
himself
alain
de
pirenne
charged
out
of
the
crowd
seized
him
in
a
bear
hug
and
wrestled
him
to
the
ground
ex
tartari
furiosi
the
shouts
rang
out
again
and
again
as
the
guards
dragged
the
assassin
out
of
the
church
simon
saw
pope
urban
shake
his
bare
white
head
slowly
then
turn
back
to
the
high
marble
altar
and
raise
the
host
overhead
once
more
de
verceuil
and
friar
mathieu
reached
simon
at
the
same
time
the
cardinal
held
out
his
hand
for
the
dagger
which
simon
had
retrieved
and
studied
it
one
could
buy
a
hundred
like
it
in
any
marketplace
he
said
keeping
his
voice
low
now
that
the
mass
had
resumed
he
thrust
the
dagger
into
his
black
leather
belt
with
a
shrug
the
white
robe
and
sandals
are
the
mark
of
the
apostolic
brethren
said
friar
mathieu
heretics
who
preach
the
doctrine
of
joachim
of
floris
about
a
coming
new
age
of
enlightenment
and
equality
when
it
comes
to
heresy
said
de
verceuil
with
an
unfriendly
grin
there
is
little
to
choose
between
the
apostolic
brethren
and
the
franciscans
many
of
your
brethren
are
secret
joachimites
of
course
he
might
have
been
dressed
that
way
only
to
deceive
us
friar
mathieu
went
on
ignoring
the
insult
we
will
find
out
who
he
is
and
whence
he
comes
said
de
verceuil
when
we
are
through
with
him
he
will
tell
us
everything
i
have
ordered
him
handed
over
to
the
podesta
of
orvieto
who
will
subject
him
to
questioning
in
his
chamber
of
torment
he
turned
on
the
ball
of
his
foot
his
violet
cloak
swinging
out
behind
him
and
headed
back
toward
the
altar
not
a
word
about
my
disarming
the
simon
thought
angrily
friar
mathieu
winced
and
shook
his
head
sadly
then
again
that
man
may
not
be
able
to
say
anything
and
the
less
he
can
tell
us
the
more
he
will
suffer
i
pity
him
simon
cringed
inwardly
at
the
thought
that
by
capturing
the
mad
heretic
he
was
the
cause
of
the
man
being
subjected
to
horrible
tortures
but
greater
fears
preoccupied
him
the
tartars
had
been
in
orvieto
only
a
few
hours
and
already
the
people
had
been
stirred
up
against
them
and
they
had
nearly
been
assassinated
somewhere
in
this
town
an
enemy
lurked
and
simon
body
turned
cold
as
he
wondered
what
that
enemy
would
do
next
xii
letter
from
emir
daoud
ibn
abdallah
to
el
malik
baibars
from
orvieto
day
of
rajab
although
the
central
part
of
italy
the
papal
states
is
said
to
be
under
the
control
of
the
pope
i
have
learned
that
his
army
is
barely
large
enough
to
protect
his
person
and
nowhere
near
enough
to
enforce
his
authority
manfred
could
attack
the
pope
whenever
he
wished
but
he
does
not
do
so
because
he
fears
that
the
other
princes
of
europe
would
then
attack
him
the
northern
part
of
italy
is
divided
among
a
number
of
cities
each
of
which
is
a
small
independent
nation
these
cities
are
often
at
war
with
one
another
the
most
important
are
venice
genoa
florence
milan
siena
pisa
and
lucca
within
each
city
there
is
also
constant
warfare
among
various
factions
the
palaces
of
the
great
families
are
all
heavily
fortified
italy
is
also
divided
between
two
parties
the
ghibellini
and
the
guelfi
these
parties
are
to
be
found
everywhere
constantly
at
each
other
throats
they
arose
long
ago
in
the
northern
part
of
the
holy
roman
empire
where
the
german
language
is
spoken
the
hohenstaufen
emperors
came
from
the
town
of
waiblingen
and
in
the
early
days
of
the
hohenstaufens
their
enemies
were
a
family
named
welf
in
italy
welfs
and
waiblings
have
become
guelfi
and
ghibellini
each
day
i
come
to
realize
more
and
more
how
complicated
the
history
of
europe
is
it
seems
that
most
of
italy
has
been
claimed
by
the
holy
roman
empire
but
rome
itself
is
not
part
of
that
empire
members
of
the
hohenstaufen
family
have
been
holy
roman
emperors
for
over
two
hundred
years
and
they
have
always
been
at
war
with
the
popes
why
the
emperor
should
be
called
holy
when
he
is
traditionally
the
enemy
of
the
pope
i
do
not
understand
furthermore
at
this
time
there
is
no
holy
roman
emperor
the
last
one
was
conrad
son
of
frederic
and
half
brother
of
manfred
he
died
ten
years
ago
and
then
manfred
proclaimed
himself
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
the
german
part
of
the
holy
roman
empire
is
in
a
more
chaotic
state
than
italy
if
my
lord
can
imagine
such
a
thing
here
in
orvieto
where
the
pope
has
settled
for
his
safety
there
are
no
ghibellini
the
townsmen
have
managed
to
find
other
reasons
to
fight
among
themselves
the
chief
rivalry
is
between
two
great
families
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
since
the
tartar
emissaries
are
guests
of
the
monaldeschi
i
hope
to
make
friends
with
the
filippeschi
seated
at
a
table
in
his
little
room
at
cardinal
ugolini
daoud
made
two
copies
of
his
letter
to
baibars
on
small
sheets
of
parchment
scraped
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
transparent
he
had
written
the
letters
in
a
code
using
the
arabian
system
of
numbers
even
if
the
message
suffered
the
unlikely
fate
of
being
intercepted
and
finding
its
way
to
one
of
the
few
christians
it
would
remain
an
enigma
daoud
rolled
up
the
two
letters
tightly
and
put
them
in
the
leather
scrip
at
his
belt
he
stepped
out
of
his
room
into
a
narrow
corridor
doors
on
his
right
opened
into
rooms
for
ugolini
guests
and
members
of
his
staff
on
his
left
windows
let
light
into
the
corridor
from
the
atrium
of
the
mansion
ugolini
cabinet
his
private
workroom
was
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
where
it
turned
a
corner
daoud
walked
up
to
the
heavy
oaken
door
and
raised
his
fist
to
knock
he
felt
as
he
did
when
going
into
combat
this
was
combat
of
a
kind
he
had
been
a
guest
in
ugolini
mansion
for
over
two
weeks
now
and
he
had
already
he
thought
hurt
the
tartars
prospects
for
an
alliance
with
the
christians
but
he
needed
to
do
much
more
with
help
from
ugolini
the
cardinal
daoud
knew
would
be
absolutely
terrified
at
the
thought
of
his
muslim
guest
appearing
before
the
pope
and
to
appear
before
the
pope
with
the
cardinal
presenting
him
was
precisely
what
daoud
wanted
to
do
he
knocked
on
the
cabinet
door
to
the
muffled
query
from
within
he
answered
it
is
david
he
heard
a
bolt
slide
back
and
he
entered
the
cabinet
cardinal
ugolini
returned
to
the
chair
at
his
worktable
which
was
strewn
with
books
and
parchment
scrolls
in
the
middle
of
the
table
lay
a
large
circular
brass
instrument
daoud
recognized
as
an
astrolabe
on
shelves
behind
the
cardinal
besides
many
more
books
and
papers
were
a
stuffed
falcon
a
stuffed
owl
and
a
human
skull
with
a
strange
diagram
painted
on
the
cranium
windows
of
translucent
white
glass
in
two
walls
let
in
an
abundance
of
light
a
good
place
to
work
thought
daoud
i
hope
i
do
not
disturb
you
your
eminence
said
daoud
not
at
all
david
said
the
cardinal
it
is
very
necessary
that
we
talk
cardinal
adelberto
ugolini
was
a
short
stout
man
with
long
gray
whiskers
that
swept
out
like
wings
from
his
full
cheeks
his
receding
chin
was
as
bare
as
the
bald
top
of
his
head
partly
covered
now
by
a
red
skullcap
he
wore
a
plain
black
robe
like
a
priest
but
from
a
chain
around
his
neck
hung
a
gold
cross
set
with
five
matching
blue
jewels
daoud
wondered
if
the
cross
concealed
a
poisoned
stiletto
like
tilia
besides
books
and
scrolls
daoud
noticed
there
were
rows
of
porcelain
jars
on
the
shelves
against
the
wall
each
had
a
latin
word
painted
on
it
ugolini
might
well
dabble
in
poison
the
man
they
seized
in
the
cathedral
is
to
be
publicly
torn
to
pieces
ugolini
said
they
have
been
torturing
him
in
the
palazzo
del
podesta
for
three
days
and
two
nights
but
they
have
learned
nothing
from
him
except
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
apostolic
brethren
a
follower
of
the
heretic
joachim
of
floris
i
am
to
go
before
the
pope
i
must
learn
about
the
disputes
among
christians
it
would
not
do
to
offend
the
christian
leaders
by
accidentally
uttering
what
does
this
joachim
teach
ugolini
waved
his
hands
dismissively
joachim
died
long
ago
but
his
rubbish
and
madness
still
stir
up
the
simple
folk
the
church
is
too
wealthy
the
clergy
are
corrupt
the
age
of
the
holy
spirit
is
coming
in
which
there
will
be
peace
justice
and
freedom
and
all
property
will
be
owned
in
common
the
doctrines
of
the
apostolic
brethren
sounded
to
daoud
like
the
teachings
of
the
hashishiyya
as
told
to
him
by
imam
fayum
ugolini
shook
himself
like
a
wet
dog
it
is
dangerous
for
you
to
involve
yourself
with
such
people
as
the
brethren
is
dangerous
for
me
to
be
here
at
daoud
thought
irritated
at
ugolini
timidity
this
heretic
does
not
know
me
so
there
is
nothing
he
can
tell
them
that
will
point
to
us
you
need
not
fear
i
feel
no
fear
ugolini
said
grandly
how
did
you
get
that
man
to
draw
a
dagger
in
the
cathedral
ugolini
asked
and
the
crowd
how
did
you
stir
them
up
daoud
saw
the
tiny
quiverings
of
ugolini
pupils
the
tightness
of
his
lips
the
clenching
of
his
jaws
the
signs
of
a
man
in
a
permanent
state
of
terror
daoud
shrugged
and
smiled
celino
found
the
madman
preaching
against
the
tartars
at
a
crossroads
and
had
men
in
his
pay
bring
him
to
orvieto
we
did
not
tell
him
what
to
do
he
did
what
he
was
moved
to
do
as
for
the
crowd
all
that
was
needed
was
for
celino
to
drop
a
word
here
and
a
coin
there
many
people
believe
the
tartars
are
demons
from
hell
perhaps
they
are
anyway
i
think
we
have
turned
the
people
of
orvieto
against
the
tartars
you
are
like
a
child
playing
with
flint
and
tinder
in
a
barn
full
of
straw
said
ugolini
blinking
his
eyes
rapidly
must
be
prodded
into
daoud
thought
said
the
idea
of
my
appearing
before
the
pope
would
terrify
him
we
must
settle
that
daoud
walked
to
one
of
the
four
mullioned
windows
the
casements
swung
inward
for
air
looking
down
through
the
iron
bars
on
the
outside
of
the
window
daoud
regarded
the
street
where
the
tartars
had
passed
the
pottery
maker
across
the
road
had
washed
away
the
bloodstains
and
was
sitting
in
front
of
his
shop
displaying
his
brightly
colored
wares
what
would
move
this
man
ugolini
money
threats
the
promise
of
personal
power
he
turned
back
and
made
himself
smile
you
do
not
want
me
here
your
eminence
ugolini
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
and
finally
said
for
over
a
dozen
years
baibars
has
been
a
figure
who
sends
me
small
rewards
in
return
for
scraps
of
harmless
information
now
suddenly
his
agent
is
in
my
home
demanding
that
i
the
cardinal
camerlengo
of
the
sacred
college
risk
death
by
torture
to
deceive
the
pope
and
betray
the
church
in
a
week
or
two
in
the
cathedral
piazza
they
will
do
horrible
things
to
that
poor
mad
heretic
but
his
sufferings
will
not
be
the
tenth
part
of
what
they
will
do
to
me
and
to
you
if
we
are
found
out
daoud
bowed
his
head
the
sooner
i
complete
my
work
the
sooner
i
am
gone
while
he
let
that
sink
in
he
decided
that
with
his
next
words
he
would
pit
his
boldness
against
ugolini
timidity
so
you
must
present
me
to
the
pope
as
soon
as
possible
ugolini
eyes
grew
wide
and
his
mouth
trembled
his
stare
with
his
sharp
nose
tiny
chin
and
trembling
whiskers
gave
him
the
look
of
a
jerboa
one
of
those
desert
rats
that
daoud
had
hunted
with
hawks
in
palestine
tilia
told
me
you
had
some
such
mad
notion
said
the
cardinal
if
you
speak
to
the
pope
and
his
court
every
important
man
in
orvieto
will
see
you
if
you
make
the
slightest
slip
that
could
reveal
what
you
really
are
they
will
be
on
you
like
hounds
on
a
fox
he
laughed
nervously
no
no
no
no
i
might
as
well
take
you
to
de
verceuil
and
say
is
the
enemy
you
are
looking
for
behold
a
muslim
even
a
mameluke
and
by
the
way
it
was
who
brought
him
into
orvieto
ugolini
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
he
did
look
as
if
he
had
been
losing
sleep
daoud
thought
remembering
what
tilia
had
told
him
daoud
felt
his
teeth
grinding
together
in
frustration
it
would
be
easier
to
fight
a
band
of
tartars
than
to
try
to
put
courage
into
this
one
little
man
and
he
needed
more
from
the
cardinal
than
compliance
must
make
him
want
not
just
to
help
me
but
to
lead
the
opposition
to
the
tartars
otherwise
this
will
be
like
trying
to
move
the
arms
and
legs
of
a
dead
the
cardinals
speak
latin
to
one
another
do
they
not
daoud
asked
i
will
say
my
piece
in
greek
and
you
will
translate
it
into
latin
for
me
so
you
will
have
a
chance
to
cover
any
errors
i
make
why
must
you
go
before
the
pope
ugolini
demanded
it
is
foolish
bravado
remain
in
seclusion
and
tell
me
what
you
want
done
and
i
will
have
it
done
for
you
the
thought
of
keeping
himself
in
hiding
while
trying
to
act
through
others
made
daoud
flesh
crawl
but
there
was
a
bit
of
hope
here
at
least
ugolini
was
offering
to
do
this
is
a
thing
only
i
can
do
daoud
said
only
i
have
seen
the
tartars
met
them
in
battle
only
i
have
seen
what
they
do
to
a
conquered
city
the
sight
and
smell
of
those
heaps
of
rotting
corpses
arose
in
his
mind
and
he
shut
his
eyes
momentarily
what
i
can
say
is
too
important
a
weapon
to
be
left
unwielded
i
know
the
tartars
better
than
any
man
in
orvieto
except
for
that
priest
in
the
brown
robe
who
came
with
them
and
he
is
on
the
other
side
how
will
you
tell
what
you
know
without
admitting
that
you
are
a
muslim
warrior
many
christian
traders
now
visit
the
lands
occupied
by
the
tartars
david
of
trebizond
has
been
one
of
them
he
spread
his
arms
as
you
see
i
now
dress
like
a
wealthy
merchant
celino
had
gone
out
with
a
bag
of
florins
from
ugolini
first
sale
of
jewels
and
he
had
come
back
with
a
chest
full
of
new
clothes
for
daoud
today
daoud
wore
a
silk
cape
as
red
as
a
cardinal
robe
it
was
light
in
weight
and
came
down
to
his
knees
more
for
display
than
for
covering
under
the
cloak
he
wore
a
tunic
of
deep
purple
embroidered
with
gold
thread
ugolini
shook
his
head
clothing
will
not
deceive
the
pope
and
those
around
him
you
are
asking
too
much
of
me
daoud
wished
he
could
give
this
up
ugolini
was
nothing
but
a
sodden
lump
of
fear
but
he
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
trying
the
cardinal
was
his
gateway
to
the
papal
court
think
of
the
reward
daoud
urged
part
of
the
wealth
i
have
brought
with
me
is
already
yours
if
the
pope
sends
the
tartars
away
without
an
agreement
my
sultan
will
give
to
you
with
both
hands
ugolini
looked
tormented
but
the
peril
daoud
had
been
certain
that
money
would
not
be
enough
to
enlist
ugolini
cooperation
baibars
already
had
been
generous
with
him
alone
will
not
move
this
as
he
searched
his
brain
for
another
approach
his
eyes
explored
the
room
the
skull
the
powders
the
brass
instruments
ugolini
was
a
student
of
many
strange
things
things
verging
on
magic
were
these
not
odd
interests
for
a
christian
prelate
he
knew
greek
which
was
rare
for
a
latin
christian
he
had
spoken
of
heresy
before
was
he
not
in
his
willingness
to
correspond
with
baibars
a
heretic
of
a
kind
and
perhaps
in
these
studies
of
his
as
well
must
remind
him
that
he
sympathizes
with
my
master
sent
me
to
you
because
he
knows
you
are
a
friend
to
islam
ugolini
raised
a
cautioning
hand
mind
you
i
am
a
christian
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
daoud
not
a
very
good
christian
ugolini
went
on
sighing
and
looking
off
into
space
god
grant
that
i
make
a
good
confession
before
i
breathe
my
last
but
i
am
also
of
the
south
of
italy
and
in
my
youth
i
lived
side
by
side
with
muslims
i
had
muslim
teachers
wise
men
from
them
i
learned
about
philosophy
medicine
astrology
alchemy
i
learned
how
much
there
is
to
know
that
i
may
never
know
daoud
felt
his
eager
heart
beat
more
rapidly
ugolini
was
speaking
just
as
he
wanted
god
help
me
i
yearn
so
for
more
worldly
knowledge
ugolini
went
on
that
was
why
i
studied
for
the
priesthood
so
i
could
go
to
the
university
of
napoli
but
what
one
can
learn
at
a
christian
university
is
not
enough
i
want
to
know
what
you
saracens
know
and
so
i
long
for
peace
between
christendom
and
islam
daoud
felt
excitement
surge
through
his
arms
and
legs
he
was
exhilarated
as
when
in
battle
he
sensed
his
opponent
was
weakening
he
pressed
his
point
you
will
never
possess
the
knowledge
you
long
for
if
the
tartars
destroy
it
think
what
was
lost
when
they
leveled
baghdad
think
what
will
be
lost
if
they
destroy
cairo
thebes
alexandria
oh
god
ugolini
cried
waving
hands
bent
like
claws
there
is
so
much
i
could
learn
in
egypt
if
only
this
stupid
enmity
between
muslim
and
christian
did
not
hold
me
back
i
am
tortured
like
tantalus
as
cardinal
camerlengo
the
pope
chamberlain
you
could
bring
before
the
pope
a
traveler
from
far
away
whose
testimony
might
influence
his
decisions
about
the
tartars
because
of
you
all
that
would
be
lost
might
be
saved
daoud
held
his
breath
waiting
for
ugolini
reply
ugolini
smiled
resignedly
to
work
for
what
i
believe
in
to
help
my
friends
and
to
be
rewarded
with
riches
how
can
i
refuse
his
expression
changed
again
as
he
looked
earnestly
at
daoud
i
do
not
know
as
much
as
your
great
islamic
astronomers
but
i
have
plotted
the
courses
of
some
stars
and
i
know
how
they
rule
our
destinies
and
my
recent
readings
have
told
me
that
i
will
take
a
risk
that
will
yield
me
rewards
beyond
my
hopes
then
you
will
present
me
to
the
pope
as
a
witness
ugolini
first
shook
his
head
but
then
sighed
and
nodded
i
can
propose
a
meeting
and
may
the
stars
watch
over
us
he
added
as
his
right
hand
traced
the
christian
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
shoulders
and
breast
stars
your
messiah
and
the
one
god
i
thought
daoud
he
allowed
himself
momentarily
to
feel
the
thrill
of
triumph
ugolini
had
begun
to
move
as
he
wanted
him
to
but
now
he
must
prepare
himself
for
a
much
greater
trial
his
meeting
with
the
pope
a
little
while
later
walking
through
a
doorway
into
the
sunlit
atrium
of
ugolini
mansion
daoud
saw
sophia
and
rachel
standing
by
the
fish
pond
under
orange
and
lemon
trees
the
polished
leaves
reflected
the
sun
upward
and
cast
shade
downward
on
the
stone
paths
and
the
pool
reflected
sunlight
rippled
over
gown
a
narrow
gold
bracelet
on
her
wrist
flashed
as
she
raised
her
hand
to
make
a
point
the
answering
smile
that
lit
face
foretold
that
she
would
be
a
beautiful
woman
in
a
few
years
she
was
dressed
better
than
she
had
been
when
they
first
met
her
daoud
noticed
that
blue
silk
gown
must
belong
to
sophia
the
cardinal
has
just
had
an
immense
turbot
delivered
all
the
way
from
livorno
messer
david
said
rachel
her
black
eyes
bright
with
wonder
alive
in
a
barrel
of
water
look
you
can
see
it
down
there
at
the
bottom
daoud
looked
down
into
the
clear
water
saw
a
tapering
dark
shape
moving
gently
just
above
the
yellow
pebbles
lining
the
bottom
of
the
pool
smaller
brown
carp
darted
this
way
and
that
above
it
the
cardinal
gold
makes
great
things
possible
he
said
will
you
leave
us
for
a
while
rachel
sophia
handed
a
small
book
to
rachel
you
may
read
these
poems
of
ovid
if
you
like
rachel
clasped
the
book
to
her
narrow
chest
i
do
not
read
latin
signora
but
i
will
look
at
the
pictures
have
a
care
said
sophia
with
a
light
laugh
some
of
them
may
shock
you
then
i
will
try
to
enjoy
being
shocked
rachel
bowed
and
hurried
away
daoud
listened
to
the
banter
between
the
woman
and
the
girl
with
mixed
feelings
he
liked
both
of
them
and
he
enjoyed
hearing
them
joke
with
each
other
he
imagined
women
must
talk
that
way
among
themselves
back
in
el
kahira
but
if
they
did
men
never
had
a
chance
to
hear
he
also
felt
deeply
uneasy
at
the
growing
closeness
between
rachel
and
sophia
the
two
of
them
shared
a
room
on
the
top
floor
of
mansion
next
to
daoud
and
lorenzo
his
stomach
tightened
as
he
thought
of
the
long
talks
they
might
have
what
if
rachel
learned
that
sophia
was
actually
a
byzantine
woman
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
the
cardinal
niece
from
sicily
and
what
if
rachel
then
let
that
slip
to
a
servant
byzantines
greek
catholics
were
hated
almost
as
much
as
muslims
here
in
the
lands
of
the
latin
church
one
small
seemingly
harmless
revelation
like
that
could
destroy
them
utterly
must
get
them
turning
to
sophia
daoud
was
struck
once
again
that
so
much
beauty
should
openly
display
itself
outside
a
harem
a
narrow
ribbon
wound
around
her
neck
crossed
between
her
breasts
and
tied
her
pale
peach
gown
tightly
at
the
waist
her
lustrous
black
hair
was
bound
in
a
net
of
gold
thread
she
looked
at
him
quizzically
daoud
studied
her
face
her
long
straight
nose
dark
red
lips
and
delicate
chin
made
him
glad
that
christian
women
went
unveiled
he
could
well
believe
this
woman
had
enjoyed
the
attentions
of
an
emperor
and
a
king
he
himself
could
not
look
at
her
without
wishing
he
might
take
her
in
his
arms
well
my
what
has
your
busy
mind
found
for
me
to
do
do
you
wish
me
to
get
myself
shot
in
the
street
by
venetians
or
create
a
disturbance
in
church
and
be
tortured
to
death
her
thrusts
caught
daoud
off
balance
feeling
a
surge
of
anger
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
jabbed
a
finger
at
her
do
you
understand
what
is
at
stake
here
her
full
lower
lip
pushed
out
i
do
not
understand
why
you
had
to
send
a
pious
simpleton
to
a
horrible
death
guilt
twisted
in
daoud
guts
like
a
hashishiyya
dagger
yet
he
could
not
admit
to
sophia
that
he
regretted
what
happened
to
the
heretic
she
might
approve
his
feeling
but
she
would
also
lose
confidence
in
him
i
will
use
any
weapon
i
can
find
he
said
even
if
it
breaks
in
my
hand
sophia
sat
down
on
the
marble
lip
of
the
fish
pond
after
a
hesitation
daoud
sat
beside
her
smoothing
his
red
cloak
under
him
where
is
lorenzo
she
asked
i
have
not
seen
him
since
the
day
the
tartars
arrived
he
visits
spoleto
to
find
a
few
bold
men
for
me
lorenzo
would
bring
back
two
or
three
men
from
spoleto
later
he
would
gather
more
men
in
viterbo
chiusi
and
other
nearby
cities
imperceptibly
over
the
coming
months
bands
of
armed
men
the
italians
called
them
bravos
would
gather
in
orvieto
to
do
daoud
bidding
acting
as
a
for
daoud
and
the
bravos
was
a
mission
at
which
lorenzo
should
do
well
the
men
lorenzo
brings
here
will
not
know
my
name
or
my
face
he
went
on
in
a
few
days
cardinal
ugolini
will
take
me
before
the
pope
and
i
will
warn
him
against
the
tartars
from
my
own
true
experience
of
them
i
must
not
be
connected
with
other
things
done
against
the
tartars
disturbances
among
the
people
armed
attacks
that
is
why
rachel
is
such
a
danger
she
had
been
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
pebbled
path
when
he
spoke
rachel
name
she
lifted
her
head
to
stare
at
him
are
you
going
to
make
me
give
up
rachel
that
annoyed
him
you
agreed
have
you
forgotten
no
but
i
thought
now
that
she
has
been
with
us
awhile
and
there
has
been
no
trouble
you
might
change
your
mind
i
do
not
change
my
mind
so
easily
by
god
working
with
this
woman
was
an
ordeal
she
argued
and
complained
far
too
much
he
wondered
whether
showing
their
faces
in
public
made
christian
women
overbold
but
where
can
she
go
you
would
not
really
cast
her
out
to
starve
tilia
caballo
will
take
her
in
you
will
force
her
into
that
horrible
fat
woman
brothel
and
she
only
a
child
she
is
nearly
thirteen
many
women
are
married
by
then
she
has
not
even
started
bleeding
yet
how
do
you
know
that
daoud
felt
somewhat
embarrassed
she
told
me
of
course
she
need
only
be
a
serving
girl
at
tilia
no
doubt
tilia
would
find
her
too
precious
a
commodity
to
be
sold
there
are
old
men
who
would
give
that
woman
her
own
weight
in
gold
to
get
their
hands
on
an
intact
virgin
child
and
these
high
churchmen
can
afford
it
daoud
remembered
the
rough
hands
of
the
first
turks
who
captured
him
and
shuddered
inside
himself
she
does
not
have
to
lie
with
men
unless
she
chooses
that
life
do
you
really
think
you
and
tilia
would
be
giving
her
a
choice
said
sophia
angrily
again
daoud
feelings
struggled
against
each
other
he
liked
the
way
she
spoke
up
fiercely
for
the
child
yet
it
angered
him
that
she
was
making
it
harder
for
him
to
deal
with
the
painful
problem
of
rachel
how
much
choice
is
anyone
in
this
world
given
he
demanded
are
you
not
here
by
choice
david
i
am
the
slave
of
my
sultan
he
said
that
is
what
the
word
means
slave
he
sent
me
here
but
i
am
also
here
by
choice
to
save
islam
from
the
tartars
she
reached
her
fingertips
into
the
water
and
dabbed
the
droplets
on
her
forehead
he
caught
the
note
of
skepticism
in
her
voice
yes
do
you
not
believe
that
can
you
see
yourself
through
my
eyes
there
was
an
earnestness
in
her
face
as
if
she
badly
wanted
not
to
doubt
him
no
how
do
you
see
me
he
asked
gently
i
see
a
frankish
warrior
fair
of
hair
and
face
she
turned
and
looked
directly
at
him
then
quickly
cast
her
eyes
down
good
looking
enough
for
a
frank
she
gestured
toward
his
knee
encased
in
scarlet
silk
you
show
a
handsome
leg
in
your
new
hose
she
cares
for
me
he
felt
a
little
leap
of
delight
and
reminded
himself
that
he
must
not
let
himself
be
drawn
to
sophia
you
and
the
turks
call
all
men
from
western
europe
franks
he
said
but
my
parents
were
not
from
france
but
of
english
descent
you
could
go
back
to
france
or
england
with
your
jewels
and
buy
a
castle
and
lands
and
an
army
of
retainers
and
live
like
a
little
king
and
forget
all
about
islam
and
the
tartars
he
did
not
want
to
argue
with
her
he
wanted
to
reach
out
and
touch
her
lips
with
his
fingertips
i
consider
myself
blessed
by
god
to
have
been
raised
amid
the
glories
of
egypt
rather
than
in
ignorance
and
dirt
among
those
you
call
franks
she
nodded
we
greeks
think
the
people
of
arabia
and
egypt
are
the
only
other
civilized
people
in
the
world
almost
as
civilized
as
we
greeks
she
said
the
last
with
a
smile
and
he
noticed
that
her
cheeks
dimpled
he
laughed
what
makes
you
so
civilized
she
clasped
her
hands
between
her
knees
and
cast
her
eyes
upward
as
if
in
deep
thought
ah
well
our
churches
are
huge
and
magnificent
so
are
our
mosques
our
paintings
and
mosaics
and
statues
of
saints
and
angels
and
emperors
are
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
idols
he
interrupted
but
he
turned
to
her
and
smiled
as
she
had
the
prophet
ordered
idols
destroyed
and
therefore
the
art
of
painting
languishes
among
you
she
said
poking
her
forefinger
into
his
shoulder
someday
i
will
show
you
my
paintings
if
you
promise
not
to
destroy
them
his
shoulder
tingled
where
she
had
touched
him
she
must
have
been
carried
away
by
her
feelings
about
the
arts
of
her
homeland
to
make
such
a
gesture
surely
it
could
not
have
been
deliberate
his
hand
rested
between
them
on
the
edge
of
the
fountain
he
moved
a
bit
closer
to
her
so
that
the
edge
of
his
hand
nearly
touched
her
thigh
he
nodded
i
will
teach
you
the
art
of
calligraphy
as
my
sufi
master
practiced
it
and
save
your
soul
would
really
like
to
do
that
ah
but
i
can
not
teach
her
to
write
arabic
what
if
someone
were
to
see
her
practice
work
he
sighed
inwardly
hm
she
grunted
i
doubt
that
can
save
soul
but
as
for
writing
we
are
familiar
with
dramatists
like
sophocles
philosophers
like
aristotle
we
read
latin
poets
like
ovid
whose
book
i
just
gave
to
rachel
here
in
his
native
italy
his
work
is
thought
licentious
i
have
read
aristotle
and
plato
in
arabic
he
said
and
i
have
no
doubt
our
persian
poets
sing
as
gloriously
as
your
greeks
and
latins
and
for
licentious
tales
those
told
in
our
bazaars
would
turn
your
cheeks
bright
red
those
cheeks
were
a
smooth
cream
color
he
observed
he
looked
about
him
there
was
no
one
but
himself
and
sophia
in
the
atrium
a
multistoried
gallery
lined
with
columns
and
arches
ran
around
all
four
sides
of
the
central
courtyard
there
might
be
servants
spies
for
the
cardinal
watching
them
but
he
could
see
no
one
on
any
of
the
levels
the
devil
with
them
for
weeks
he
had
been
wanting
to
reach
out
and
touch
that
unveiled
beauty
that
ivory
skin
now
he
did
it
very
lightly
his
fingers
traveled
from
her
cheekbone
to
her
jaw
she
reached
up
and
took
his
hand
not
to
remove
it
as
he
had
momentarily
thought
she
might
but
to
hold
it
briefly
against
her
cheek
then
let
it
go
they
sat
silently
looking
at
each
other
she
was
so
still
that
she
seemed
not
even
to
breathe
while
he
discovered
that
his
heart
was
beating
fast
and
hard
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
but
not
here
where
hidden
eyes
might
be
watching
but
kissing
her
at
all
would
be
a
mistake
the
thought
shook
him
the
realization
that
he
must
not
get
any
closer
to
her
he
felt
as
if
a
rope
were
tied
around
his
neck
and
a
cruel
slave
master
had
jerked
on
it
is
not
for
me
she
is
for
my
he
turned
away
from
her
it
is
better
if
we
do
not
grow
too
close
he
said
fixing
his
eyes
on
a
nearby
orange
tree
i
must
use
you
i
will
send
you
as
my
sultan
has
sent
me
and
you
will
lie
with
the
man
i
choose
as
my
quarry
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
she
was
smiling
sadly
her
eyes
clouded
with
disappointment
it
pleased
him
in
a
bittersweet
way
to
see
that
she
shared
his
unhappiness
i
am
slave
then
he
shook
his
head
i
do
not
know
whose
you
are
king
manfred
i
suppose
or
perhaps
emperor
michael
you
have
been
given
to
me
in
trust
like
that
emerald
i
brought
here
from
el
kahira
from
cairo
what
you
will
have
to
do
here
will
be
no
worse
i
am
sure
than
what
you
must
have
had
to
do
before
this
i
am
sure
there
was
a
dark
note
in
her
voice
now
he
wished
he
could
take
back
what
he
said
and
ease
her
bitterness
but
he
had
spoken
truly
and
it
was
needful
that
she
realize
it
if
you
serve
me
well
i
will
reward
you
he
promised
you
will
be
able
to
do
anything
in
the
world
you
want
of
that
i
can
not
be
sure
she
said
this
time
it
was
he
who
took
her
hand
and
held
it
tightly
for
a
moment
her
hand
felt
cool
and
lifeless
in
his
grasp
we
may
not
be
lovers
he
said
but
perhaps
we
can
be
friends
perhaps
she
said
distantly
nettled
he
rose
and
left
her
if
she
would
not
accept
him
on
those
terms
could
he
trust
her
he
turned
his
back
on
her
and
left
the
garden
he
longed
to
know
her
thoughts
could
she
love
him
he
knew
he
should
not
hope
for
that
because
it
would
have
to
come
to
nothing
but
he
hoped
she
loved
him
at
least
a
little
it
was
not
until
he
was
back
in
his
apartment
about
to
begin
his
noon
prayer
facing
the
charcoal
mark
he
had
made
on
the
wall
to
point
out
the
direction
of
mecca
that
he
realized
what
she
had
done
to
him
we
settled
nothing
about
he
struck
his
fist
on
the
wall
he
would
have
to
be
more
careful
with
sophia
she
could
be
very
difficult
even
dangerous
is
time
i
had
a
when
a
man
went
without
the
delights
of
the
bedchamber
for
too
long
he
became
too
susceptible
to
the
cleverness
of
beautiful
women
it
had
been
four
months
since
that
last
night
in
el
kahira
when
his
wife
baibars
favorite
daughter
blossoming
reed
had
kept
him
awake
all
night
with
her
devouring
love
not
caring
that
he
must
begin
a
great
journey
the
following
day
yes
he
was
leaving
her
he
remembered
the
words
she
had
said
to
him
when
she
gave
him
the
locket
just
before
the
battle
of
the
well
of
goliath
for
your
pleasure
as
many
women
as
you
like
but
love
always
and
only
me
for
if
you
do
love
another
i
promise
you
that
your
love
will
destroy
both
her
and
it
would
be
best
if
he
went
to
tilia
caballo
brothel
and
enjoyed
a
woman
he
was
not
so
likely
to
fall
in
love
with
daoud
strode
through
the
crowded
streets
at
dusk
enjoying
the
golden
light
that
fell
on
the
upper
stories
of
the
yellow
houses
of
orvieto
his
scarlet
cape
blew
out
behind
him
and
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
heads
turn
to
follow
his
passage
he
walked
close
to
the
houses
on
his
right
keeping
away
from
the
ruts
and
the
rivulets
of
sewage
in
the
center
of
the
street
men
stepped
into
the
filth
making
way
for
him
he
was
bigger
and
better
dressed
than
anyone
he
met
and
a
new
sword
with
a
jeweled
hilt
swung
at
his
belt
the
glances
he
caught
from
the
short
dark
men
of
orvieto
were
not
friendly
think
i
am
a
frank
and
like
sophia
they
hate
pigs
rooted
in
garbage
in
the
quintane
the
narrow
spaces
between
the
houses
small
dogs
ran
under
his
feet
what
backward
unsanitary
people
these
europeans
were
the
sights
and
smells
of
orvieto
made
him
wish
for
the
paved
streets
of
el
kahira
where
every
day
an
army
of
slaves
swept
and
cleared
away
refuse
the
cardinal
had
drawn
a
map
of
orvieto
for
him
showing
the
principal
streets
and
the
way
to
tilia
house
daoud
had
committed
the
map
to
memory
using
the
concentration
technique
saadi
had
taught
him
most
of
the
streets
had
no
names
he
would
have
to
find
his
way
by
landmarks
in
the
days
to
come
he
planned
he
would
explore
and
add
to
the
map
in
his
mind
until
he
knew
every
street
in
orvieto
the
house
of
tilia
caballo
stood
on
a
street
that
was
wider
than
most
at
the
east
end
of
town
even
though
ugolini
had
described
it
as
daoud
was
surprised
to
see
how
much
it
resembled
the
shabby
buildings
on
either
side
of
it
he
had
expected
some
sign
of
luxury
some
flamboyance
he
had
thought
to
hear
music
as
he
approached
as
he
would
have
outside
one
of
the
brothels
of
el
kahira
before
baibars
closed
them
the
house
was
quiet
unadorned
save
for
a
balcony
above
the
entryway
it
gave
no
sign
of
who
its
occupants
were
he
knew
it
only
by
counting
fifth
house
from
the
corner
ugolini
had
said
unlike
the
roof
of
the
cardinal
palace
which
was
flat
the
roof
of
tilia
house
was
sharply
peaked
it
looked
like
anything
but
a
brothel
and
though
there
were
enough
small
houses
near
it
to
hold
two
or
three
hundred
people
the
street
was
not
crowded
as
were
streets
everywhere
else
in
orvieto
he
saw
a
few
men
lounging
in
doorways
a
pair
of
men
walking
arm
in
arm
past
front
door
but
that
was
all
distinguished
churchmen
and
men
of
wealth
and
good
family
could
come
here
without
attracting
notice
so
i
seem
to
be
the
only
visitor
who
comes
before
dusk
well
if
people
see
me
and
think
i
am
a
merchant
who
frequents
orvieto
finest
brothel
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
them
to
he
felt
the
heaviness
in
his
groin
and
the
lightness
in
his
stomach
that
always
accompanied
his
visits
to
women
when
he
had
done
without
pleasure
for
a
long
time
he
wondered
if
the
christian
courtesan
he
picked
tonight
would
be
able
to
match
the
accomplishments
of
the
women
who
served
the
mamelukes
in
el
kahira
she
would
surely
not
be
able
to
equal
the
incredible
pleasures
he
had
enjoyed
with
blossoming
reed
he
knocked
at
the
plain
door
and
it
swung
open
immediately
as
if
the
one
behind
it
had
watched
him
approach
there
stood
one
of
tilia
black
men
wearing
a
turban
robes
and
pantaloons
that
for
all
the
world
made
him
look
like
a
harem
guard
in
el
kahira
the
costume
made
daoud
uneasy
the
slave
bowed
in
silence
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
bade
daoud
enter
the
entrance
hall
was
a
surprise
it
seemed
much
too
large
for
the
building
he
had
just
entered
he
stood
on
a
persian
carpet
in
a
wide
room
filled
with
light
candles
burned
in
sconces
around
the
walls
and
in
two
chandeliers
hanging
from
the
ceiling
two
tall
thick
candles
stood
in
twisting
brass
stands
the
height
of
a
man
on
either
side
of
a
marble
staircase
a
pungent
fragrance
filled
the
air
and
daoud
realized
that
the
candles
were
scented
if
tilia
could
afford
to
burn
this
many
candles
every
night
her
trade
must
be
profitable
indeed
he
understood
now
why
the
interior
of
tilia
establishment
was
so
different
from
the
exterior
she
must
have
acquired
all
the
buildings
side
by
side
along
this
street
and
then
hollowed
them
out
he
noticed
that
where
the
walls
of
the
building
through
which
he
had
entered
should
have
been
there
stood
marble
roman
columns
two
stories
high
counting
the
rows
of
columns
stretching
right
and
left
he
estimated
that
this
great
hall
must
be
as
wide
as
five
of
the
original
houses
that
had
been
absorbed
into
tilia
mansion
the
black
man
struck
a
large
gong
beside
the
door
giving
off
a
low
mellow
note
almost
immediately
tilia
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
smiling
broadly
she
flounced
down
the
steps
the
gold
and
jewels
scattered
over
her
person
throwing
off
sparks
in
every
direction
i
knew
you
would
be
coming
soon
david
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
glad
you
came
early
in
the
evening
we
can
talk
freely
now
if
more
of
my
clients
were
here
we
would
have
to
seclude
ourselves
daoud
jerked
his
head
at
the
black
servant
why
in
god
name
do
you
dress
your
men
as
muslims
here
where
there
is
so
much
fear
and
hatred
of
as
they
call
us
tilia
laughed
the
pillow
of
flesh
under
her
chin
quivering
do
you
not
know
that
it
has
long
been
fashionable
among
christians
to
borrow
from
the
world
of
islam
they
copy
everything
from
ways
of
dressing
to
words
and
ideas
most
people
think
the
hohenstaufens
have
gone
too
far
with
their
saracen
army
but
among
the
great
houses
of
italy
each
must
have
its
moorish
servants
with
great
turbans
and
sashes
and
pantaloons
and
here
in
orvieto
the
pope
city
it
makes
my
clients
feel
especially
wicked
to
enter
a
house
staffed
with
slaves
so
dressed
i
would
not
enjoy
going
into
a
brothel
where
the
servants
were
dressed
like
christian
monks
daoud
said
scornfully
tilia
sighed
i
will
tell
you
what
seeing
these
men
in
saracen
garb
does
for
me
it
reminds
me
of
when
i
was
a
young
woman
in
cairo
she
looked
around
at
her
hall
and
sighed
again
young
and
beautiful
and
unhappy
now
i
am
rich
and
content
but
i
tell
you
in
all
honesty
i
would
give
all
this
up
to
be
young
and
beautiful
daoud
was
surprised
he
had
not
known
that
tilia
had
once
lived
in
el
kahira
was
that
he
wondered
how
baibars
came
to
know
her
was
that
why
even
though
daoud
did
not
fully
trust
her
he
felt
oddly
comfortable
with
her
and
where
are
the
young
and
beautiful
and
unhappy
women
in
this
house
then
she
smiled
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
are
you
here
to
avail
yourself
first
i
want
to
send
a
message
to
my
master
then
that
of
course
come
with
me
he
followed
her
up
the
marble
steps
idly
wondering
if
her
rump
looked
as
huge
with
her
gown
off
and
whether
cardinal
ugolini
actually
did
go
to
bed
with
her
and
if
so
how
he
could
be
aroused
by
such
a
grossly
fat
woman
not
that
ugolini
with
his
rodent
face
was
any
more
attractive
than
his
mistress
the
stairs
to
the
third
floor
were
narrower
and
darker
and
more
winding
and
after
that
there
was
a
maze
of
corridors
to
negotiate
even
with
the
help
of
the
sufi
mental
training
for
warriors
daoud
knew
he
would
never
be
able
to
find
his
way
here
again
tilia
gestured
to
a
trapdoor
push
that
back
for
me
daoud
climbed
a
ladder
raised
the
heavy
door
and
found
himself
on
a
walkway
built
over
the
centerline
of
a
roof
it
was
wide
enough
for
two
men
to
stand
side
by
side
but
there
was
no
railing
and
on
either
side
the
roof
sloped
down
sharply
the
walkway
led
to
a
small
structure
made
of
wooden
slats
from
which
daoud
heard
fluttering
and
cooing
the
sight
of
the
dovecote
and
the
sound
of
the
warbling
pigeons
reminded
daoud
of
the
rooftops
of
el
kahira
and
for
a
moment
he
yearned
for
a
sight
of
the
bhar
flowing
swiftly
past
the
city
or
the
sound
of
the
muezzin
call
to
prayer
he
stopped
to
look
around
this
was
an
excellent
vantage
point
from
here
he
could
see
that
tilia
mansion
was
actually
shaped
like
ugolini
a
hollow
square
around
an
atrium
the
difference
was
that
her
establishment
was
made
from
the
joining
of
many
houses
that
had
once
been
separate
from
here
he
could
also
see
most
of
orvieto
rows
and
rows
of
peaked
roofs
glowed
warm
red
and
orange
in
the
sunset
off
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
city
bulked
the
great
roof
of
the
cathedral
like
a
galley
among
rowboats
to
the
south
the
six
square
turrets
of
the
pope
palace
and
on
all
sides
of
the
city
the
rounded
green
hills
of
this
part
of
italy
called
umbria
the
piccioni
fly
to
napoli
said
tilia
breathlessly
behind
him
daoud
was
amazed
at
how
she
had
managed
to
climb
so
many
steps
and
finally
a
ladder
there
must
be
muscle
under
all
that
fat
he
pulled
open
the
whitewashed
wooden
door
of
the
dovecote
his
entry
set
off
a
furious
flapping
of
wings
unleashing
a
storm
of
feathers
in
the
dark
enclosure
the
smell
of
pigeon
droppings
was
heavy
in
the
warm
air
he
began
breathing
through
his
mouth
to
keep
the
odor
out
of
his
nose
tilia
pushed
past
him
whistling
and
clucking
to
the
pigeons
and
calming
them
down
who
gets
the
messages
in
napoli
he
asked
she
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
another
brothel
keeper
a
man
i
will
not
tell
you
his
name
the
wives
of
my
piccioni
live
in
his
dovecote
when
i
release
a
piccione
here
he
flies
to
napoli
and
visits
with
his
wife
until
one
of
my
servants
rides
there
and
brings
him
back
piccioni
are
much
more
faithful
to
their
mates
than
men
and
women
daoud
laughed
he
enjoyed
tilia
cynicism
the
strong
light
of
the
setting
sun
fell
in
bars
through
the
slats
across
her
face
and
body
how
long
does
it
take
for
the
messages
to
reach
el
kahira
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
simpleton
who
can
say
from
napoli
someone
must
take
the
message
capsules
aboard
a
ship
to
a
port
in
outremer
so
how
long
it
takes
depends
on
whether
the
sea
is
angry
or
calm
once
in
outremer
they
might
go
on
by
piccioni
again
or
by
camel
caravan
once
i
had
a
reply
within
two
months
the
longest
i
had
to
wait
was
a
year
and
three
months
she
had
daoud
noted
the
brothel
good
memory
for
numbers
may
this
arrive
sooner
than
that
daoud
reached
into
a
leather
scrip
at
his
belt
and
drew
out
the
two
rolled
slips
of
parchment
each
crowded
with
tiny
arabic
characters
two
letters
where
is
the
other
one
going
both
to
baibars
they
are
duplicates
we
do
that
in
the
field
whenever
possible
twice
as
much
chance
that
the
message
will
get
through
i
will
send
one
tonight
and
the
other
tomorrow
morning
what
are
you
telling
him
daoud
was
not
sure
tilia
should
be
asking
him
that
but
as
morgiana
she
had
sent
baibars
dozens
of
long
letters
from
orvieto
surely
no
one
had
a
better
right
to
know
about
this
correspondence
daoud
shrugged
that
i
have
arrived
here
safely
with
two
companions
sent
with
me
by
king
manfred
and
that
we
have
been
welcomed
by
the
one
who
was
awaiting
me
even
though
this
is
written
in
a
cipher
your
name
and
the
cardinal
name
are
not
mentioned
i
go
on
to
say
that
we
have
stirred
up
the
people
of
orvieto
against
the
tartars
and
that
i
will
soon
speak
against
them
before
the
pope
and
i
tell
him
something
of
what
i
have
learned
about
italy
he
is
very
curious
about
the
lands
of
the
infidel
the
cardinal
has
agreed
to
present
you
to
pope
urban
then
her
eyebrows
twitched
and
her
mouth
tightened
her
look
of
displeasure
irritated
him
for
all
he
knew
it
was
her
influence
that
made
ugolini
so
difficult
but
he
thought
with
grudging
admiration
she
herself
seemed
more
resolute
than
the
cardinal
he
came
to
see
that
it
was
the
only
course
open
to
us
you
are
persuasive
i
see
better
why
your
master
sent
you
she
took
the
parchments
from
him
rolled
them
even
tighter
and
tied
each
one
into
a
tiny
leather
capsule
one
capsule
disappeared
into
a
jeweled
purse
that
hung
on
her
hip
the
other
she
put
aside
while
she
reached
into
a
cage
whistling
and
twittering
her
hand
came
out
again
grasping
a
pigeon
this
is
tonio
he
is
ten
years
old
he
always
gets
through
daoud
was
amazed
at
how
calmly
the
pigeon
reposed
in
tilia
hand
he
was
even
more
surprised
when
she
handed
the
bird
to
him
but
he
quickly
took
him
holding
him
around
the
back
with
thumb
and
forefinger
behind
his
head
leaving
his
chest
free
so
he
could
breathe
easily
you
handled
birds
before
she
said
deftly
fastening
a
capsule
under
tonio
wing
she
took
the
bird
back
from
daoud
outside
the
coop
she
opened
her
hands
and
the
bird
took
off
with
a
fanning
of
wings
there
now
said
tilia
with
that
out
of
the
way
perhaps
you
would
like
a
piccione
of
another
sort
for
your
pleasure
i
would
indeed
said
daoud
feeling
a
warmth
spread
through
his
body
i
have
just
the
one
for
you
tilia
said
patting
him
on
the
arm
as
they
returned
to
the
trap
door
her
name
is
francesca
she
is
beautiful
and
very
discreet
she
will
serve
you
supper
and
if
you
like
her
you
may
spend
the
night
with
her
and
you
need
pay
me
nothing
you
are
too
generous
madama
said
daoud
recovering
from
a
small
surprise
he
had
assumed
that
tilia
would
give
him
access
to
her
women
out
of
simple
hospitality
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
have
to
pay
xiii
simon
stood
shifting
from
foot
to
foot
in
the
graveled
yard
before
the
palace
of
pope
urban
an
italian
cardinal
had
just
arrived
with
his
retinue
of
bishops
monsignori
priests
and
monks
and
simon
knew
it
would
be
some
time
before
the
procession
passed
all
the
guards
and
the
majordomo
at
the
main
door
alain
de
pirenne
beside
him
said
in
a
low
voice
i
still
believe
it
we
are
about
to
attend
a
council
called
by
the
pope
himself
his
blue
eyes
were
huge
and
his
fair
skin
was
flushed
with
excitement
he
was
dressed
in
his
best
an
azure
tunic
with
silver
embroidery
at
the
sleeves
and
collar
and
on
his
feet
poulaines
black
deerskin
shoes
whose
elongated
toes
came
to
points
the
hilt
of
the
longsword
hanging
at
his
waist
was
plain
but
simon
knew
it
had
been
in
the
pirenne
family
for
generations
do
not
believe
it
yet
alain
simon
said
wryly
we
were
not
invited
and
we
have
not
yet
been
let
in
surely
they
would
not
keep
out
so
great
a
seigneur
as
you
said
alain
especially
when
you
have
been
faithfully
protecting
the
tartars
for
a
month
well
that
is
what
i
am
counting
on
simon
said
they
stood
inside
a
high
wall
of
tufa
the
same
rock
on
which
orvieto
stood
the
wall
topped
with
square
battlements
surrounded
the
papal
palace
simon
gaze
swept
beyond
the
wall
toward
the
bluish
tops
of
nearby
hills
wreathed
in
morning
mist
then
back
to
the
row
of
pine
trees
that
stood
between
the
wall
and
the
palace
the
massed
green
of
the
needles
almost
so
dark
as
to
appear
black
the
palace
itself
fortified
by
six
square
turrets
was
of
white
limestone
it
must
have
cost
the
papal
treasury
a
fortune
simon
thought
to
haul
all
those
big
blocks
up
here
within
this
solid
edifice
surrounded
by
this
high
wall
atop
the
impregnable
mesa
of
orvieto
the
holy
father
was
certainly
well
protected
the
last
monk
in
his
gray
gown
had
passed
the
guards
at
the
door
and
simon
saw
more
clergymen
massing
at
the
outer
gate
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
started
up
the
stairs
de
pirenne
hurrying
behind
him
he
reminded
himself
am
the
count
de
he
said
as
much
to
the
majordomo
who
stood
before
him
in
white
silk
tunic
with
the
keys
of
peter
embroidered
in
black
on
the
left
breast
ah
your
signory
i
saw
your
brave
battle
in
the
cathedral
with
that
heretic
assassin
the
majordomo
had
a
prominent
upper
lip
that
made
him
look
like
a
horse
a
thousand
welcomes
to
the
palace
of
his
holiness
i
will
be
happy
to
tell
him
that
you
are
attending
the
council
he
showed
big
yellow
teeth
in
an
unctuous
grin
then
his
face
fell
as
he
looked
down
at
simon
belt
i
regret
your
signory
but
you
may
not
wear
your
sword
in
the
palace
of
the
pope
even
though
you
wielded
it
most
gloriously
in
his
holiness
service
only
the
papal
guards
may
bear
arms
within
a
thousand
pardons
but
you
must
take
it
off
you
may
leave
it
with
the
capitano
of
the
guard
if
you
wish
simon
face
burned
with
embarrassment
as
he
realized
he
was
going
to
have
to
disappoint
alain
the
scimitar
was
one
of
his
most
precious
possessions
and
he
would
not
entrust
it
to
a
stranger
even
a
stranger
in
the
service
of
the
pope
with
a
sigh
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
handed
it
with
his
dagger
and
the
scimitar
to
de
pirenne
if
only
i
had
thought
to
bring
thierry
with
us
he
said
forgive
me
alain
but
would
you
be
good
enough
to
take
these
back
to
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
then
you
can
meet
me
back
here
forgive
your
signory
the
majordomo
interjected
i
am
desolate
but
his
holiness
himself
has
commanded
that
no
one
is
to
enter
after
the
council
begins
simon
felt
angry
words
forcing
their
way
to
his
lips
but
he
clamped
his
mouth
shut
this
was
after
all
the
court
of
the
vicar
of
christ
on
earth
and
he
did
not
dare
protest
against
its
customs
he
had
the
reputation
of
france
to
think
of
these
italians
already
thought
the
french
were
all
barbarians
i
knew
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
de
pirenne
said
with
a
rueful
smile
as
he
turned
away
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
in
the
yard
outside
monseigneur
simon
shared
his
friend
unhappiness
this
would
have
been
something
for
alain
to
remember
for
the
rest
of
his
life
bring
our
horses
simon
said
we
can
go
riding
in
the
country
after
the
council
is
over
alain
downcast
face
brightened
at
that
simon
knew
that
alain
born
and
reared
in
a
country
castle
hated
being
cooped
up
in
town
simon
turned
away
feeling
dread
at
having
to
go
into
the
papal
court
alone
the
great
hall
of
the
pope
palace
was
long
high
narrow
and
shadowy
even
though
it
was
a
sunny
day
outside
the
small
windows
of
white
glass
on
both
sides
of
the
room
admitted
insufficient
light
and
had
to
be
supplemented
by
a
double
row
of
chandeliers
each
bearing
dozens
of
candles
the
pope
could
have
saved
himself
the
cost
of
a
great
many
candles
simon
thought
if
he
had
built
his
great
hall
in
the
new
style
like
the
king
palace
in
paris
with
buttresses
that
allowed
for
much
larger
windows
but
this
was
italy
he
reminded
himself
where
there
was
war
in
the
city
streets
even
war
against
the
pope
large
glass
windows
would
offer
poor
protection
the
king
of
france
did
not
have
such
worries
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
a
long
flight
of
marble
steps
swept
up
to
an
enormous
gilded
throne
empty
at
present
down
the
center
of
the
steps
ran
a
purple
carpet
and
over
the
carpet
lay
a
wide
strip
of
white
linen
two
rows
of
pews
faced
each
other
on
either
side
of
the
throne
between
them
was
a
table
laid
with
rolls
of
parchment
an
inkstand
and
a
sheaf
of
quills
the
pews
were
as
yet
empty
but
around
them
stood
cardinals
in
bright
red
robes
with
flat
red
hats
some
of
them
simon
remembered
seeing
at
the
cathedral
two
weeks
before
farther
removed
from
the
throne
and
more
numerous
were
the
archbishops
and
bishops
scattered
around
the
hall
were
priests
monks
and
friars
in
black
white
brown
and
gray
there
must
be
nearly
a
hundred
men
in
the
room
simon
guessed
the
air
was
filled
with
a
buzz
of
conversation
he
felt
the
hollow
in
his
stomach
and
the
trembling
in
his
knees
that
disturbed
him
whenever
he
entered
a
roomful
of
strangers
and
these
strangers
were
most
of
them
the
spiritual
lords
of
the
church
he
looked
for
a
place
where
he
could
stand
inconspicuously
he
dared
not
speak
to
anyone
he
felt
as
if
a
frown
from
one
of
these
men
would
be
enough
to
send
him
into
disordered
retreat
and
suddenly
before
him
there
was
the
frowning
face
of
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
the
wide
red
hat
with
its
heavy
tassels
seemed
precariously
balanced
on
his
head
his
gold
pectoral
cross
was
set
with
emeralds
and
rubies
the
buttons
that
ran
down
the
front
of
his
scarlet
cassock
simon
noticed
were
embroidered
with
gold
thread
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
simon
cast
about
wildly
in
his
mind
for
a
sensible
answer
nothing
he
could
say
he
was
sure
would
win
this
cardinal
approval
i
i
feel
it
is
important
that
i
know
what
is
decided
here
your
eminence
these
deliberations
are
no
business
of
yours
your
duty
is
to
protect
the
ambassadors
you
have
deserted
your
post
stung
simon
wished
de
verceuil
were
not
an
ordained
priest
and
a
prince
of
the
church
so
that
he
could
challenge
him
that
he
could
do
nothing
about
de
verceuil
accusation
infuriated
him
the
tartars
are
safely
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
guarded
by
all
of
our
knights
and
when
count
charles
laid
this
task
upon
me
i
understood
that
i
was
to
help
advance
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
i
can
not
do
that
if
i
am
kept
in
ignorance
after
a
pause
he
added
your
eminence
that
was
almost
as
good
as
a
challenge
simon
felt
and
his
limbs
tingled
he
wanted
to
raise
his
arms
and
shake
his
fists
de
verceuil
face
turned
a
deep
maroon
but
before
he
could
speak
a
figure
also
in
cardinal
red
appeared
beside
them
paulus
de
verceuil
is
this
not
the
young
count
de
gobignon
peer
of
the
realm
you
are
remiss
mon
ami
you
should
have
realized
that
the
french
cardinals
here
in
orvieto
would
wish
to
meet
one
of
greatest
barons
this
cardinal
had
a
long
black
beard
and
eyes
set
in
deep
hollows
he
could
easily
have
presented
a
dour
figure
but
stood
smiling
with
his
hands
clasped
over
a
broad
stomach
de
verceuil
took
several
deep
breaths
and
his
cheeks
returned
to
their
normal
color
monseigneur
the
cardinal
guy
le
gros
i
present
the
count
simon
de
gobignon
he
said
in
a
sour
monotone
simon
immediately
dropped
to
one
knee
and
bent
his
head
toward
the
ring
the
cardinal
held
out
to
him
the
stone
as
big
as
cardinal
le
knuckle
was
a
spherical
polished
sapphire
with
a
star
glowing
in
its
center
holding
the
cardinal
cold
soft
hand
simon
touched
the
gem
lightly
with
his
lips
believe
i
am
supposed
to
gain
an
indulgence
from
kissing
this
he
thought
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
tried
to
remember
what
he
knew
about
guy
le
gros
he
had
heard
a
bit
about
each
of
the
fourteen
french
cardinals
le
gros
he
recalled
had
been
a
knight
and
a
prominent
lawyer
ultimately
a
member
of
the
king
cabinet
then
he
had
joined
the
clergy
he
had
been
the
first
cardinal
elevated
by
pope
urban
doubtless
you
knew
count
simon
late
father
said
de
verceuil
to
le
gros
since
you
served
as
a
counselor
to
the
king
simon
wanted
to
shrink
out
of
sight
at
the
reminder
of
amalric
de
gobignon
de
verceuil
had
mentioned
him
out
of
deliberate
cruelty
simon
was
certain
he
felt
even
more
crushed
when
he
saw
the
pained
look
that
passed
briefly
over
cardinal
le
gros
features
oh
yes
i
met
your
father
many
years
ago
said
le
gros
his
light
tone
reassuring
simon
a
bit
he
was
a
tall
man
like
you
but
blond
as
i
recall
the
suggestion
that
he
did
not
resemble
amalric
de
gobignon
chilled
simon
as
a
father
of
unmarried
daughters
cardinal
le
gros
de
verceuil
said
you
might
be
interested
to
know
that
the
count
has
no
wife
le
gros
shrugged
and
smiled
at
simon
his
eminence
never
misses
an
opportunity
to
remind
me
that
i
was
once
a
family
man
perhaps
paulus
envies
my
wider
experience
of
life
not
at
all
de
verceuil
protested
or
perhaps
he
thinks
it
a
scandal
that
a
cardinal
should
have
daughters
said
le
gros
still
addressing
simon
at
least
mine
are
legitimate
unlike
the
offspring
of
certain
other
princes
of
the
church
as
for
the
high
office
it
was
not
my
choice
his
holiness
commanded
me
he
leaned
confidentially
toward
simon
he
needed
more
french
cardinals
he
can
not
trust
the
italians
to
support
him
against
the
accursed
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
even
more
than
that
he
was
hoping
you
could
persuade
king
louis
to
give
his
brother
charles
permission
to
fight
manfred
said
de
verceuil
you
failed
him
in
that
that
case
is
not
closed
said
le
gros
indeed
what
we
do
here
today
may
lead
directly
to
the
overthrow
of
the
odious
manfred
as
i
am
sure
you
both
understand
he
smiled
first
at
simon
then
at
de
verceuil
but
should
we
not
be
speaking
latin
the
mother
tongue
of
the
church
some
lupus
might
be
spying
on
us
in
latin
de
verceuil
answered
i
fear
count
simon
would
be
unable
to
follow
us
not
at
all
domini
mei
simon
cut
in
quickly
also
in
latin
i
have
had
some
instruction
in
that
language
his
many
and
often
quarreling
guardians
had
agreed
at
least
that
he
should
have
an
education
far
superior
to
that
of
most
other
great
barons
having
studied
for
two
years
at
the
university
of
paris
simon
had
once
been
the
victim
of
a
lupus
a
wolf
an
informer
who
reported
students
for
breaking
the
university
rule
that
latin
must
be
spoken
at
all
times
the
fine
he
paid
was
negligible
but
his
embarrassment
was
keen
good
for
you
my
boy
said
le
gros
patting
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
de
verceuil
lips
puckered
as
if
he
had
been
sucking
on
a
lemon
a
sudden
blast
of
trumpets
silenced
the
conversation
in
the
hall
servants
swung
open
double
doors
near
the
papal
throne
and
two
men
entered
one
was
pope
urban
whom
simon
had
not
seen
since
the
day
of
that
papal
mass
for
the
tartar
ambassadors
his
white
beard
fanned
in
wispy
locks
over
his
chest
the
mouth
framed
by
his
beard
was
compressed
and
his
eyes
were
hard
simon
knew
that
he
had
been
born
jacques
pantaleone
at
troyes
in
france
not
far
from
gobignon
and
was
a
shoemaker
son
only
in
the
church
could
a
man
from
such
a
humble
beginning
rise
to
such
high
position
urban
had
the
face
of
a
man
who
could
cut
the
toughest
leather
to
his
pattern
age
had
bent
the
pope
somewhat
and
he
leaned
on
the
shoulder
of
a
man
who
walked
beside
him
this
man
was
so
unusual
a
figure
that
he
drew
simon
attention
away
from
pope
urban
like
the
holy
father
he
was
wearing
white
but
it
was
the
white
robe
of
a
dominican
friar
and
it
curved
out
around
his
belly
like
the
sail
of
a
galley
with
the
wind
behind
it
he
was
partially
bald
his
face
round
as
a
full
moon
and
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
were
half
buried
in
flesh
the
sallow
color
of
new
wheat
he
nodded
repeatedly
in
response
to
something
the
pope
was
earnestly
saying
to
him
who
is
simon
whispered
earning
himself
a
black
look
from
de
verceuil
fra
tomasso
said
cardinal
le
gros
i
am
told
he
is
the
wisest
man
alive
papa
pantaleone
has
appointed
him
to
conduct
this
inquiry
unfortunately
why
unfortunately
dominus
meus
bad
enough
for
us
that
is
italian
he
is
also
a
relative
of
the
hohenstaufens
his
older
brothers
have
served
both
frederic
and
manfred
a
relative
of
the
hohenstaufens
de
verceuil
exclaimed
loud
enough
for
two
nearby
bishops
to
turn
and
stare
at
him
how
can
his
holiness
trust
such
a
man
fra
tomasso
is
not
close
a
relative
said
le
gros
papa
pantaleone
hates
the
hohenstaufens
more
than
anyone
have
they
not
forced
him
to
immure
himself
here
in
the
hills
when
he
should
by
rights
be
reigning
in
rome
and
yet
he
favors
aquino
because
aquino
is
loyal
to
the
church
and
well
informed
come
let
us
find
our
seats
they
walked
together
toward
the
pews
near
the
papal
throne
and
simon
was
suddenly
standing
alone
at
the
back
of
the
congregation
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
leading
up
to
his
throne
pope
urban
turned
smiled
and
spread
his
hands
in
benediction
he
intoned
a
prayer
beginning
dominus
deus
very
rapidly
in
latin
and
followed
with
greetings
to
all
present
he
mentioned
each
cardinal
archbishop
and
bishop
by
name
then
several
distinguished
abbots
and
monsignori
his
white
beard
fluttered
as
he
spoke
then
simon
heard
and
we
greet
with
joy
our
countryman
simon
count
de
gobignon
who
bears
one
of
france
most
ancient
and
honored
names
a
stunning
brightness
blinded
simon
as
if
lightning
had
struck
right
in
front
of
him
and
honored
in
front
of
so
many
leaders
of
the
church
if
at
this
moment
some
hidden
enemy
were
to
shoot
an
arrow
at
the
pope
simon
would
have
leapt
to
take
it
in
his
own
breast
with
joy
magnanimity
simon
thought
he
remembered
the
majordomo
saying
he
would
tell
the
pope
simon
was
there
he
looked
to
see
how
de
verceuil
had
reacted
to
the
pope
singling
him
out
but
the
cardinal
was
hidden
somewhere
in
the
rows
of
figures
lined
up
in
their
pews
on
either
side
of
the
pope
simon
noticed
other
prelates
staring
at
him
then
turning
away
as
he
looked
at
them
and
his
face
went
hot
meanwhile
the
pope
was
talking
about
the
tartars
we
must
soon
decide
whether
it
be
god
will
that
christian
princes
join
with
the
tartars
and
aid
them
in
their
war
against
the
saracens
or
whether
we
should
forbid
this
alliance
with
pagans
we
shall
have
a
private
audience
later
this
week
with
the
two
ambassadors
from
tartary
but
today
we
ask
your
counsel
so
that
all
may
speak
freely
we
have
expressly
not
invited
the
tartar
emissaries
we
ask
god
to
help
us
make
a
wise
decision
he
introduced
fra
tomasso
to
simon
surprise
pope
urban
did
not
then
ascend
to
his
throne
but
instead
came
down
disappearing
into
the
midst
of
his
counselors
the
cardinals
sat
in
their
pews
the
lesser
dignitaries
sat
on
smaller
chairs
in
rows
facing
the
throne
when
everyone
was
in
place
simon
could
see
pope
urban
in
a
tall
oaken
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
there
was
no
chair
for
simon
even
though
the
pope
had
greeted
him
by
name
no
matter
many
of
the
lesser
clergy
also
remained
standing
he
pressed
forward
through
the
crowd
until
he
was
just
behind
the
seated
men
so
that
he
could
see
and
hear
better
the
corpulent
fra
tomasso
took
his
place
behind
the
table
in
a
heavy
chair
wider
than
the
pope
though
its
back
was
not
as
high
he
called
for
cardinal
adelberto
ugolini
the
cardinal
a
tiny
man
with
flowing
side
whiskers
and
a
receding
chin
stood
up
at
his
place
in
the
pews
he
in
turn
summoned
from
the
audience
a
knight
called
sire
cosmas
sire
cosmas
an
elderly
man
walked
stiffly
to
the
pope
and
knelt
before
him
ugolini
told
the
assembly
that
cosmas
had
seen
and
fought
the
tartar
invaders
in
his
native
hungary
and
was
driven
from
his
home
by
them
tartars
have
long
since
withdrawn
from
simon
thought
did
sire
cosmas
never
go
back
there
sire
cosmas
was
lean
and
dark
with
gray
hair
that
fell
to
his
shoulders
over
scarlet
gloves
he
wore
many
rings
that
flashed
as
he
gestured
they
came
without
warning
and
all
at
once
like
a
summer
cloudburst
the
hungarian
said
one
moment
we
were
at
peace
the
next
the
lines
of
tartar
horsemen
darkened
the
eastern
horizon
from
the
baltic
to
the
adriatic
sire
cosmas
latin
was
very
good
fast
and
fluent
simon
stood
transfixed
as
cosmas
described
the
fall
of
one
russian
city
after
another
how
the
tartars
leveled
riazan
moscow
and
kiev
and
butchered
all
their
people
they
would
gather
all
the
women
rape
them
and
cut
their
throats
the
men
they
cut
in
two
impaled
on
stakes
roasted
flayed
alive
used
as
archery
targets
or
suffocated
by
pounding
dirt
down
their
throats
the
details
of
the
atrocities
sickened
simon
on
into
poland
the
tartars
came
cosmas
tale
of
the
trumpeter
of
krakow
who
kept
sounding
the
alarm
from
the
cathedral
tower
until
tartar
arrows
struck
him
down
brought
tears
to
simon
eyes
simon
found
the
hungarian
recital
spellbinding
cosmas
had
undoubtedly
repeated
his
account
many
times
polishing
his
storytelling
skills
a
little
more
with
each
occasion
it
was
probably
easy
and
perhaps
profitable
for
him
to
remain
in
western
europe
telling
and
retelling
in
great
halls
and
at
dinner
tables
his
adventures
with
the
tartars
much
is
cardinal
ugolini
paying
him
for
this
performance
the
flower
of
european
chivalry
engaged
the
tartars
at
liegnitz
in
poland
sire
cosmas
said
and
when
the
battle
was
over
thousands
of
knights
from
hungary
poland
germany
italy
france
england
and
as
far
away
as
spain
lay
dead
and
dying
on
the
field
and
the
tartars
were
triumphant
they
turned
then
to
meet
another
mighty
christian
army
that
of
king
bela
of
hungary
at
mohi
i
fought
in
that
battle
cosmas
declared
the
tartars
bombarded
us
with
terrible
weapons
that
burst
into
flame
and
gave
off
poisonous
smoke
so
that
men
died
of
breathing
it
we
advanced
against
them
and
discovered
that
we
were
surrounded
their
pitiless
volleys
of
arrows
slowly
reduced
our
numbers
all
that
long
day
in
the
late
afternoon
we
saw
their
columns
gathering
for
a
charge
but
we
also
saw
a
gap
in
their
line
many
of
us
myself
among
them
rushed
for
that
gap
throwing
down
our
arms
and
armor
so
we
could
escape
more
quickly
it
was
a
devilish
trick
the
tartar
heavy
cavalry
fell
upon
those
who
remained
behind
now
few
in
number
and
slaughtered
all
the
light
cavalry
rode
along
the
flanks
of
those
who
retreated
shooting
them
down
till
bodies
in
their
thousands
littered
the
road
i
was
one
of
the
few
who
by
grace
and
by
feigning
death
lived
the
tartars
advanced
to
the
danube
he
went
on
burning
everything
killing
all
the
people
in
towns
and
villages
they
burned
pest
to
the
ground
on
christmas
day
in
the
year
the
danube
froze
hard
the
tartars
crossed
and
destroyed
buda
they
advanced
into
austria
tartar
columns
were
sighted
from
the
walls
of
vienna
europe
lay
helpless
before
them
only
the
hand
of
god
saved
us
he
willed
that
at
that
very
moment
the
emperor
of
the
tartars
in
their
homeland
should
die
sire
cosmas
concluded
all
the
kings
and
generals
of
the
tartars
had
to
depart
from
europe
with
their
armies
to
choose
their
next
emperor
those
parts
of
poland
and
hungary
they
had
occupied
they
left
a
dead
silent
desert
since
then
the
tartars
have
made
war
on
the
saracens
which
pleases
us
of
course
but
is
the
enemy
of
our
enemy
truly
our
friend
permit
me
to
doubt
it
good
fathers
we
are
no
better
able
to
fight
the
tartars
now
than
we
were
after
mohi
i
urge
you
to
let
the
tartars
and
saracens
wear
themselves
out
fighting
each
other
let
us
not
help
the
tartars
with
their
distant
wars
losing
knights
and
men
we
might
later
need
to
defend
europe
against
those
devils
themselves
sire
cosmas
words
chilled
simon
he
felt
himself
almost
persuaded
that
the
tartars
were
a
menace
to
the
world
it
might
be
a
grave
error
to
work
for
an
alliance
with
them
and
yet
for
the
sake
of
his
family
he
had
accepted
this
mission
he
could
not
back
down
now
uneasily
he
rubbed
his
damp
palms
on
his
tunic
there
was
a
murmur
of
conversation
as
sire
cosmas
finished
and
bowed
fra
tomasso
scribbling
notes
on
a
parchment
looked
up
and
asked
did
you
say
that
the
tartar
soldiers
have
the
faces
of
dogs
sire
cosmas
cosmas
shook
his
head
looking
himself
somewhat
sheepish
simon
thought
we
spoke
of
them
so
because
their
pointed
fur
caps
made
them
look
like
dogs
i
wondered
because
aristotle
writes
of
men
with
animals
heads
living
in
remote
regions
said
the
stout
dominican
he
made
a
note
cosmas
brightened
they
do
eat
the
flesh
of
living
prisoners
and
i
hope
i
may
not
offend
your
chastity
by
telling
you
this
but
they
slice
off
the
breasts
of
the
women
they
rape
and
serve
them
as
delicacies
to
their
princes
raw
simon
thought
of
john
and
philip
and
wondered
whether
they
had
ever
done
such
horrible
things
he
wished
he
had
learned
more
about
the
tartars
before
agreeing
to
pursue
this
cause
to
hear
of
such
deeds
is
not
likely
to
cause
concupiscent
movements
in
normal
men
said
fra
tomasso
dryly
have
you
seen
such
abominations
with
your
own
eyes
no
said
cosmas
but
i
heard
it
from
many
people
when
the
tartars
were
invading
us
thank
you
said
making
another
note
he
put
his
quill
down
and
started
to
heave
his
bulk
up
from
his
chair
cardinal
ugolini
darted
past
him
resting
his
hand
momentarily
on
shoulder
and
the
dominican
settled
back
down
again
that
cardinal
looks
just
like
a
fat
little
mouse
simon
thought
one
of
the
italians
and
it
was
he
who
had
brought
this
sire
cosmas
to
speak
against
the
tartars
he
might
well
be
a
key
opponent
of
the
alliance
what
would
it
take
to
change
his
mind
ugolini
beckoned
toward
the
audience
and
a
tall
blond
man
came
forward
now
to
stand
beside
him
have
seen
him
simon
thought
holy
fathers
said
ugolini
providence
sends
us
this
man
david
of
trebizond
a
trader
in
cathayan
silks
he
has
traveled
in
recent
years
among
the
tartars
david
speaks
greek
but
not
latin
i
will
translate
what
he
says
simon
remembered
at
last
where
he
had
seen
david
of
trebizond
standing
on
a
balcony
and
looking
pleased
as
the
people
rioted
against
the
tartar
ambassadors
and
now
here
to
speak
against
the
alliance
the
back
of
his
neck
tingling
simon
thought
man
is
an
xiv
ugolini
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
the
blond
man
in
a
language
simon
guessed
was
greek
and
david
answered
at
some
length
you
must
suppose
now
that
i
am
david
speaking
directly
to
you
said
ugolini
in
latin
to
the
assembly
patting
the
front
of
his
red
satin
robe
i
come
from
an
old
merchant
family
of
trebizond
caravans
from
across
turkestan
bring
us
silks
from
cathay
we
are
christians
according
to
the
greek
rite
this
provoked
a
hostile
murmur
from
the
audience
ugolini
hesitated
then
said
i
speak
in
my
own
person
for
a
moment
i
too
am
inclined
to
treat
as
suspect
what
a
catholic
of
the
schismatic
greek
church
tells
me
but
i
have
talked
long
with
david
and
i
am
convinced
he
is
a
virtuous
man
after
all
the
greeks
like
us
are
believers
in
christ
and
trebizond
is
at
war
with
constantinople
so
we
can
trust
this
man
the
more
for
that
again
david
spoke
in
greek
to
ugolini
unable
to
understand
words
simon
listened
to
his
voice
it
was
rich
and
resonant
a
virtuous
man
a
traveling
mountebank
more
likely
he
felt
a
deep
distrust
of
both
david
and
ugolini
from
time
to
time
the
saracens
tried
to
conquer
us
but
with
the
grace
of
god
we
fought
them
off
said
david
through
ugolini
and
when
we
were
not
at
war
with
them
we
traded
with
them
for
trebizond
lives
by
trade
and
now
that
the
tartars
have
conquered
all
of
persia
we
trade
with
them
fra
tomasso
raised
a
broad
hand
and
asked
do
you
find
the
tartars
honest
traders
they
would
rather
take
what
they
want
by
looting
or
tribute
or
taxation
eventually
they
think
they
will
not
have
to
trade
they
believe
the
blue
sky
which
they
worship
will
permit
them
to
conquer
the
whole
world
and
then
all
peoples
will
slave
for
them
just
as
they
use
subject
people
so
if
you
ally
yourselves
with
them
they
will
use
you
you
will
help
them
destroy
the
moslems
and
then
they
will
turn
on
you
hates
the
tartars
i
can
hear
it
in
his
voice
see
it
in
the
glow
in
his
eyes
he
is
sincere
enough
about
a
cardinal
shouted
out
something
in
latin
too
rapid
for
simon
to
understand
an
archbishop
bellowed
an
answer
two
cardinals
were
arguing
loudly
in
the
pews
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
suddenly
all
the
church
leaders
seemed
to
be
talking
at
once
fra
tomasso
picked
up
a
little
bell
from
his
desk
and
rang
it
vigorously
simon
could
barely
hear
it
and
everyone
ignored
it
princes
of
the
church
quarrel
among
themselves
like
ordinary
pope
urban
stood
up
and
lifted
his
arms
silence
he
cried
his
voice
was
shrill
and
louder
than
fra
tomasso
bell
the
argument
died
down
have
you
seen
the
tartar
army
in
action
messer
david
asked
david
was
silent
a
long
time
before
answering
his
face
took
on
a
haunted
look
his
eyes
seemed
to
gaze
at
something
far
away
i
was
at
baghdad
a
week
after
they
took
it
i
came
to
trade
with
the
tartars
there
were
no
other
people
left
in
that
country
to
trade
with
the
tartar
camp
was
many
leagues
away
from
the
ruins
of
baghdad
they
had
to
move
away
from
the
city
to
escape
the
smell
of
the
dead
i
went
to
baghdad
because
i
wanted
to
see
i
saw
nothing
but
ashes
and
corpses
for
miles
and
miles
the
stink
of
rotting
flesh
nearly
killed
me
i
found
people
who
had
survived
those
who
had
not
gone
mad
told
me
what
had
happened
the
tartars
commanded
the
caliph
to
surrender
he
said
he
would
pay
tribute
but
he
could
not
surrender
his
authority
to
them
because
he
was
the
spiritual
head
of
islam
simon
heard
murmurs
of
derision
at
this
but
david
ignored
them
and
speaking
through
ugolini
went
on
over
a
hundred
thousand
tartars
surrounded
baghdad
and
their
siege
machines
began
smashing
its
walls
with
great
rocks
brought
down
from
the
mountains
by
slave
caravans
soon
their
standards
which
are
made
of
the
horns
and
hides
and
tails
of
beasts
were
raised
over
the
southeastern
wall
from
the
racecourse
gate
to
the
persian
tower
the
city
was
lost
the
tartars
promised
to
spare
the
remaining
troops
if
they
would
surrender
the
soldiers
of
baghdad
went
out
unarmed
and
the
tartars
killed
them
all
with
arrows
this
is
the
tartars
notion
of
honor
they
will
do
the
same
to
us
shouted
a
cardinal
the
pope
slapped
his
palm
loudly
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
silence
settled
again
hulagu
khan
the
commander
of
the
tartar
army
now
entered
the
city
and
made
the
caliph
serve
him
a
splendid
dinner
after
dinner
the
khan
demanded
that
the
caliph
show
him
all
the
jewels
and
gold
and
silver
and
other
treasures
that
had
been
gathered
by
the
caliphs
of
baghdad
over
the
centuries
hulagu
promised
to
let
the
caliph
live
together
with
a
hundred
of
his
women
this
brought
a
loud
cackle
from
under
one
of
the
red
hats
in
the
front
row
only
a
hundred
women
a
voice
followed
the
laughter
poor
caliph
how
many
was
he
wont
to
have
seeing
how
ugly
those
saracens
women
are
i
would
think
one
wife
too
many
another
prelate
called
out
irritated
simon
wished
he
could
silence
them
all
this
was
too
serious
a
matter
for
such
unseemly
jokes
the
ribald
jests
continued
to
simon
annoyance
until
fra
tomasso
rang
his
bell
then
david
looking
grimmer
than
ever
spoke
to
ugolini
and
ugolini
began
to
address
the
assembly
next
the
tartars
commanded
all
the
people
of
baghdad
to
herd
out
onto
the
plain
outside
the
city
telling
them
that
they
would
be
made
to
leave
the
city
only
while
the
tartars
searched
it
for
valuables
when
they
had
the
people
at
their
mercy
they
separated
them
into
three
groups
men
women
and
children
when
families
are
broken
up
the
members
do
not
fight
as
hard
to
survive
the
tartars
slaughtered
them
with
swords
and
arrows
two
hundred
thousand
men
women
and
children
they
killed
that
day
after
promising
them
they
would
not
be
harmed
simon
tried
to
imagine
the
butchering
of
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
he
had
never
seen
any
saracens
and
so
the
victims
in
his
eye
tended
to
resemble
the
people
of
paris
he
shuddered
inwardly
as
he
pictured
those
countless
murders
the
tartars
now
entered
the
city
whose
people
were
all
dead
and
sacked
and
burned
it
it
had
been
such
a
great
city
that
it
took
them
seven
days
to
reduce
it
to
ruins
simon
heart
turned
to
ice
if
it
were
paris
could
we
fight
any
harder
for
paris
than
the
saracens
did
for
baghdad
tartari
they
have
a
superstition
that
it
is
bad
luck
to
shed
the
blood
of
royal
personages
so
they
took
the
caliph
and
his
three
royal
sons
who
had
seen
their
city
destroyed
and
all
their
people
killed
tied
them
in
sacks
and
rode
their
horses
over
them
trampling
them
to
death
these
deeds
of
the
tartars
smell
sweet
in
the
nostrils
of
the
lord
shouted
cardinal
de
verceuil
there
were
cries
of
approval
without
waiting
for
david
to
say
more
ugolini
replied
to
de
verceuil
yes
baghdad
was
the
seat
of
a
false
religion
but
it
was
also
a
city
of
philosophers
mathematicians
historians
poets
of
colleges
hospitals
of
wealth
of
science
of
art
and
of
two
hundred
thousand
souls
as
david
has
told
us
muslim
souls
but
souls
nevertheless
now
does
not
and
whoever
thinks
that
the
tartars
will
do
such
things
only
to
saracen
cities
is
a
fool
simon
hated
to
admit
it
but
ugolini
words
made
perfect
sense
to
him
they
will
do
it
everywhere
cried
someone
in
the
audience
now
david
said
through
ugolini
what
is
more
the
tartars
who
rule
in
russia
have
converted
to
islam
they
still
dream
of
the
conquest
of
europe
and
may
return
to
the
attack
at
any
time
perhaps
while
your
armies
are
occupied
in
egypt
or
syria
fra
tomasso
raised
his
quill
for
attention
how
would
you
describe
the
character
of
the
tartars
master
david
what
sort
of
men
are
they
david
answered
and
then
looked
about
with
his
bright
compelling
gaze
while
ugolini
translated
i
have
lived
among
the
tartars
and
traveled
with
them
the
tartar
is
unmoved
by
his
own
pain
or
by
that
of
his
fellows
the
suffering
of
other
people
merely
amuses
him
his
word
given
to
a
foreigner
means
nothing
to
him
he
thinks
his
own
race
superior
to
all
other
peoples
on
earth
fra
tomasso
said
what
you
have
told
us
has
been
most
enlightening
master
david
because
you
have
seen
with
your
own
eyes
but
if
your
empire
of
trebizond
now
trades
with
the
tartars
how
is
it
that
you
come
here
to
denounce
them
i
came
to
orvieto
as
a
merchant
bearing
samples
of
silk
from
cathay
said
david
it
is
only
as
cardinal
ugolini
has
said
god
providence
that
i
am
here
when
you
are
deciding
this
great
question
fra
tomasso
turned
to
pope
urban
holy
father
is
there
anything
else
you
wish
me
to
ask
pope
urban
shook
his
head
i
believe
i
have
heard
enough
for
now
we
do
not
want
to
sit
here
all
day
smiling
he
turned
to
david
master
david
we
thank
you
for
coming
all
this
way
to
bring
us
this
warning
your
holiness
david
bowed
a
fluid
movement
that
made
simon
grunt
with
distaste
the
luck
why
is
there
no
one
here
who
knows
the
tartars
to
answer
this
david
how
do
we
know
he
is
not
a
liar
a
greek
silk
merchant
is
not
the
sort
of
person
i
would
trust
he
would
say
anything
if
he
thought
it
would
help
him
sell
his
but
doubt
cooled
simon
anger
he
did
not
want
to
admit
it
but
cosmas
and
david
tales
had
frightened
him
he
thought
of
the
hard
cold
faces
of
john
and
philip
he
see
them
beheading
women
shooting
children
with
arrows
we
want
to
ally
ourselves
with
such
creatures
king
louis
did
count
charles
uncle
charles
wanted
the
alliance
simon
had
agreed
to
come
here
how
could
he
face
uncle
charles
what
could
he
say
if
he
changed
his
mind
a
lifetime
of
scorn
that
was
what
lay
ahead
of
him
if
he
were
to
turn
back
now
david
sat
stiffly
upright
his
hands
resting
on
his
knees
as
cardinal
ugolini
approached
the
pope
reaching
out
in
appeal
holy
father
your
predecessor
clement
iii
of
happy
memory
declared
a
crusade
against
the
tartars
after
the
battle
of
mohi
i
beg
you
to
sound
the
alarm
again
like
that
brave
trumpeter
of
krakow
a
christian
prince
should
no
more
make
a
pact
with
the
tartars
than
with
the
devil
let
the
nations
of
christendom
be
warned
in
the
sternest
terms
let
us
declare
excommunicate
any
christian
ruler
who
allies
himself
with
the
tartars
shocked
outcries
burst
from
all
parts
of
the
hall
simon
went
cold
the
thought
of
king
louis
being
excommunicated
horrified
him
but
surely
it
would
not
come
to
that
king
louis
was
too
loyal
a
catholic
to
defy
the
pope
but
that
then
meant
that
simon
mission
would
fail
de
verceuil
jumped
to
his
feet
you
ugolini
you
should
be
excommunicated
for
even
suggesting
such
a
thing
cardinal
paulus
you
yourself
have
had
much
to
say
out
of
turn
pope
urban
said
testily
i
give
you
leave
now
to
speak
in
favor
of
this
proposed
alliance
de
verceuil
took
his
stand
in
front
of
the
papal
throne
and
ugolini
returned
to
his
place
in
the
pews
only
the
pope
favored
us
more
he
is
a
frenchman
after
all
what
about
this
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
the
pope
needs
french
help
there
but
what
a
disaster
for
us
that
he
asks
de
verceuil
to
speak
if
any
man
can
turn
friends
into
enemies
it
is
de
verceuil
we
need
friar
mathieu
in
god
name
where
is
he
he
could
answer
this
david
of
de
verceuil
quickly
dismissed
the
hungarian
testimony
all
that
he
said
happened
a
generation
ago
today
the
tartars
would
not
win
such
easy
victories
in
europe
because
we
know
more
about
them
and
they
would
not
invade
europe
again
because
they
know
more
about
us
the
tartars
have
new
leaders
since
those
days
and
that
is
why
they
have
chosen
to
make
war
on
the
mohammedans
christian
friars
have
gone
among
them
and
many
tartars
have
been
baptized
the
wife
of
hulagu
khan
is
a
christian
wherever
the
khan
and
his
wife
travel
they
take
a
christian
chapel
mounted
on
a
cart
and
mass
is
said
for
them
daily
yes
ugolini
cried
from
his
seat
a
nestorian
chapel
the
wife
and
the
other
tartars
you
call
christians
are
nestorian
heretics
from
what
i
have
heard
of
your
dabblings
in
alchemy
and
astrology
it
ill
behooves
you
to
speak
of
heresy
cardinal
ugolini
said
de
verceuil
darkly
ugolini
stood
up
and
advanced
on
de
verceuil
who
was
twice
his
height
as
for
christian
friars
going
among
the
tartars
he
held
up
a
small
book
let
me
read
de
verceuil
turned
to
pope
urban
holy
father
you
have
given
me
leave
to
speak
true
but
more
than
once
you
interrupted
him
said
urban
with
a
smile
let
us
hear
this
the
franciscan
friar
william
of
rubruk
at
the
command
of
king
louis
of
france
visited
the
court
of
the
tartar
emperor
in
karakorum
said
ugolini
this
is
his
account
of
his
travels
in
that
pagan
capital
he
says
the
tartars
were
so
stubborn
in
their
ways
that
he
made
not
a
single
convert
he
opened
to
a
page
marked
with
a
ribbon
here
is
his
conclusion
after
years
among
the
tartars
it
allowed
me
i
would
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
preach
war
against
them
throughout
the
whole
world
ugolini
slapped
the
book
shut
and
sat
down
looking
triumphant
de
verceuil
failed
to
respond
immediately
what
a
poor
advocate
he
was
simon
thought
if
only
friar
mathieu
were
here
he
too
was
a
franciscan
like
this
william
of
rubruk
and
he
might
well
have
the
answer
to
rubruk
words
friar
william
de
verceuil
said
at
last
wrote
years
before
the
tartars
conquered
baghdad
as
for
me
i
count
myself
happy
to
have
heard
the
words
of
this
merchant
from
trebizond
he
pointed
a
long
finger
at
david
who
stood
in
the
crowd
about
twenty
feet
away
from
simon
david
looked
back
at
de
verceuil
with
a
rigid
face
full
of
raw
hatred
that
reminded
simon
of
what
he
had
read
about
basilisks
happy
i
say
de
verceuil
went
on
to
hear
every
detail
of
the
utter
destruction
of
that
center
of
the
satanic
worship
of
mohammed
i
was
reminded
of
the
rain
of
fire
and
brimstone
that
wiped
out
sodom
and
gomorrah
my
heart
sang
with
joy
when
i
heard
of
the
caliph
successor
of
that
false
prophet
trampled
by
tartar
horses
i
hold
that
the
tartars
are
god
instrument
for
the
final
downfall
of
his
enemies
what
wonderful
allies
they
will
make
as
we
liberate
the
holy
land
from
the
saracens
once
and
for
all
and
who
will
liberate
the
holy
land
from
the
tartars
a
cardinal
forgetting
his
latin
shouted
in
italian
be
still
you
fool
cried
another
cardinal
in
french
the
italian
advanced
on
the
frenchman
whoever
says
he
gave
the
french
cardinal
a
vicious
shove
with
both
hands
shall
be
liable
to
the
another
shove
fra
tomasso
rang
his
small
bell
furiously
but
the
furious
prelates
ignored
him
now
someone
had
seized
the
italian
from
behind
simon
was
shocked
having
never
dreamed
the
leaders
of
the
church
could
be
so
unruly
it
seemed
that
anything
the
french
cardinals
were
for
the
italians
were
against
and
was
the
pope
though
a
frenchman
likely
to
approve
the
alliance
with
nearly
half
the
cardinals
against
it
and
even
if
he
did
could
it
succeed
in
the
face
of
that
much
opposition
pax
the
pope
cried
climbing
a
few
steps
toward
his
throne
and
lifting
his
arms
heavenward
peace
the
angry
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
sight
of
him
slowly
brought
quiet
to
the
hall
urban
took
them
to
task
the
whole
future
of
christendom
might
be
at
stake
and
they
were
brawling
like
university
students
perhaps
he
should
treat
them
like
students
and
have
them
whipped
sheepishly
the
cardinals
and
bishops
took
their
seats
with
much
rustling
of
red
and
purple
robes
asked
de
verceuil
if
he
had
finished
he
said
he
had
and
simon
heart
sank
promised
uncle
charles
i
would
work
to
further
the
alliance
i
want
to
believe
in
but
after
listening
to
ugolini
two
witnesses
and
de
verceuil
feeble
attempt
to
refute
them
he
was
beset
by
frightening
doubts
he
prayed
he
would
not
have
to
reverse
himself
if
he
changed
his
colors
now
and
repudiated
the
alliance
count
charles
might
well
feel
himself
betrayed
and
say
that
simon
was
no
better
than
his
father
but
did
not
a
franciscan
named
the
stout
dominican
consulted
his
notes
on
parchment
mathieu
journey
from
outremer
with
these
tartar
ambassadors
why
is
he
not
here
to
tell
us
what
he
knows
about
them
hope
leapt
up
in
simon
heart
yes
if
they
would
only
hear
friar
mathieu
that
might
yet
win
the
day
for
the
alliance
it
might
help
me
to
feel
i
am
doing
the
right
i
assumed
before
this
august
body
my
testimony
would
be
sufficient
said
de
verceuil
with
a
slight
stammer
after
all
what
could
a
mere
franciscan
friar
add
fra
tomasso
raised
his
eyebrows
i
remind
you
cardinal
that
his
holiness
has
entrusted
the
conduct
of
this
inquiry
to
a
friar
myself
and
william
of
rubruk
whose
book
was
quoted
here
today
was
a
friar
can
this
friar
mathieu
be
found
and
quickly
de
verceuil
spread
his
hands
i
have
no
idea
where
he
is
fra
tomasso
he
parted
company
with
us
after
we
arrived
in
orvieto
and
neglected
to
tell
us
his
whereabouts
lie
friar
mathieu
had
told
everyone
he
would
be
at
the
franciscan
hospital
of
santa
clara
simon
was
honor
bound
to
speak
out
still
it
took
all
his
courage
to
force
words
through
his
throat
loud
words
at
that
to
make
himself
heard
over
the
murmur
of
many
conversations
reverend
father
he
called
out
and
his
heart
hammered
in
terror
as
hundreds
of
eyes
turned
toward
him
de
verceuil
first
of
all
reverend
father
fra
tomasso
turned
toward
simon
i
know
where
friar
mathieu
is
simon
called
raised
his
eyebrows
who
are
you
young
man
when
simon
announced
himself
as
the
count
de
gobignon
friar
tomasso
smile
was
welcoming
enough
to
reassure
simon
a
bit
friar
mathieu
is
at
the
hospital
of
the
franciscans
said
simon
he
told
me
he
wanted
to
work
there
until
his
services
were
needed
for
the
embassy
his
services
are
needed
now
said
not
summoning
him
here
was
an
oversight
he
glanced
coolly
at
de
verceuil
the
hospital
is
not
far
away
i
know
where
it
is
reverend
father
simon
had
gone
to
the
hospital
to
inquire
about
the
man
shot
in
the
street
by
the
venetians
he
who
had
died
despite
friar
mathieu
urgent
efforts
then
have
the
friar
fetched
at
once
count
if
you
please
said
simon
shot
a
quick
look
at
de
verceuil
before
he
turned
to
leave
the
cardinal
was
staring
at
him
his
long
face
a
deep
crimson
and
his
eyes
narrowed
to
black
slits
their
eyes
met
and
simon
felt
almost
as
if
swords
had
clashed
why
was
de
verceuil
who
wanted
the
alliance
so
angry
know
he
wanted
to
be
the
authority
on
the
tartars
he
wanted
to
carry
the
day
for
the
alliance
all
by
hard
to
believe
simon
thought
but
it
seemed
de
verceuil
would
rather
see
his
cause
lost
than
have
someone
else
win
credit
for
its
success
i
shall
fetch
him
myself
fra
tomasso
simon
said
loudly
to
his
relief
he
found
de
pirenne
expecting
an
outing
in
the
country
with
their
two
horses
just
outside
the
papal
palace
wall
simon
explained
his
errand
and
together
they
made
the
short
ride
through
the
streets
to
the
franciscan
hospital
there
the
father
superior
hastily
summoned
friar
mathieu
de
pirenne
relinquished
his
horse
to
the
old
franciscan
friar
bare
skinny
shanks
when
he
hiked
up
his
robe
to
sit
in
the
saddle
looked
comical
to
simon
i
knew
the
holy
father
had
called
a
council
today
said
friar
mathieu
but
i
assumed
cardinal
de
verceuil
would
send
for
me
if
i
were
needed
better
to
assume
that
he
will
do
the
opposite
of
what
is
needed
said
simon
friar
mathieu
laughed
and
slapped
simon
shoulder
the
pope
servants
were
passing
flagons
of
wine
and
trays
of
meat
tarts
when
simon
and
friar
mathieu
entered
the
hall
the
arguments
among
the
prelates
had
risen
almost
to
a
roar
but
died
down
as
men
saw
simon
escorting
the
small
figure
of
mathieu
in
his
threadbare
brown
robe
toward
the
papal
throne
fra
tomasso
spoke
softly
and
respectfully
to
the
elderly
franciscan
while
de
verceuil
glowered
from
the
pews
friar
mathieu
stood
before
the
pope
seeming
as
serene
and
as
if
he
were
in
a
chapel
by
himself
why
should
he
not
thought
simon
after
what
simon
had
heard
about
the
tartars
today
it
seemed
to
him
that
anyone
who
could
live
for
years
among
them
could
face
anything
quickly
summarized
what
had
been
said
so
far
hearing
the
clarity
and
simplicity
with
which
the
dominican
conveyed
the
arguments
simon
could
see
why
he
was
thought
of
as
a
great
teacher
and
philosopher
i
must
warn
your
excellencies
said
friar
mathieu
that
if
you
sent
a
thousand
men
to
journey
among
the
tartars
you
would
get
a
thousand
reports
each
very
different
also
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
tartars
are
changing
so
rapidly
that
what
was
true
of
them
a
year
ago
may
no
longer
be
so
today
italy
france
england
the
holy
roman
empire
all
have
existed
for
hundreds
of
years
the
church
has
carried
on
christ
work
for
over
a
thousand
years
this
city
of
orvieto
is
even
older
but
a
mere
hundred
years
ago
the
tartars
were
tribes
of
herdsmen
even
simpler
than
the
hebrews
of
moses
day
now
they
rule
the
largest
empire
the
world
has
ever
seen
how
could
such
a
thing
happen
simon
wondered
it
seemed
almost
miraculous
the
tartars
must
have
had
the
help
of
god
or
the
devil
imagine
a
baby
with
the
size
and
strength
of
a
giant
mathieu
said
with
a
smile
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
such
a
gigantic
infant
might
in
a
moment
of
ungoverned
anger
kill
thousands
of
people
destroy
all
manner
of
precious
objects
even
sweep
away
whole
cities
but
an
infant
learns
rapidly
and
so
it
is
with
the
tartars
the
new
emperor
or
khakhan
as
they
call
him
kublai
reads
and
writes
and
converses
in
many
languages
and
he
does
not
destroy
cities
he
builds
them
he
is
the
brother
of
hulagu
who
sent
the
ambassadors
here
simon
began
to
feel
relieved
friar
mathieu
calm
words
washed
over
him
easing
his
fear
that
he
was
doing
wrong
by
supporting
the
tartar
alliance
fra
tomasso
raised
a
pudgy
finger
if
the
tartars
are
so
powerful
and
are
gaining
in
knowledge
does
this
not
make
them
even
more
of
a
danger
to
christendom
it
could
said
the
old
franciscan
let
me
say
fra
tomasso
and
holy
father
with
a
bow
to
the
pope
i
can
tell
you
only
what
i
have
seen
and
then
with
god
help
you
must
judge
what
is
best
for
christendom
simon
glanced
over
at
the
formidable
david
of
trebizond
who
up
to
now
had
been
the
most
expert
witness
on
the
tartars
he
stood
stiffly
staring
at
is
a
man
sore
and
de
verceuil
who
should
have
been
pleased
at
having
this
help
looked
just
as
vexed
mathieu
outshines
the
cardinal
and
he
is
we
have
been
told
that
the
tartars
plan
to
conquer
the
whole
world
said
for
a
time
they
thought
they
could
friar
mathieu
nodded
but
the
world
surprised
them
by
going
on
and
on
and
now
their
empire
is
so
huge
they
can
not
hold
it
together
and
they
are
such
innocents
the
nations
they
conquer
are
destroying
them
they
die
in
great
numbers
of
the
diseases
of
cities
in
their
prairie
homeland
they
were
not
familiar
with
the
strong
wine
drunk
by
farmers
and
city
folk
and
now
many
of
their
leaders
die
untimely
deaths
of
drink
also
as
they
grow
wealthier
and
more
powerful
they
fight
over
the
spoils
they
have
taken
when
they
invaded
europe
they
were
still
united
and
they
were
able
to
throw
all
their
strength
into
that
war
but
now
they
have
broken
into
four
almost
independent
nations
so
divided
and
extended
they
are
much
less
of
a
danger
to
christendom
how
could
they
hold
their
empire
together
thought
simon
when
they
had
been
nothing
but
ignorant
herdsmen
a
generation
ago
mathieu
discourse
made
sense
so
said
fra
tomasso
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
a
giant
but
with
a
creature
closer
to
our
own
size
yes
said
mathieu
and
the
proof
is
that
only
a
few
years
ago
for
the
first
time
anywhere
in
the
world
the
tartars
lost
a
great
battle
they
were
defeated
by
the
mamelukes
of
egypt
at
a
place
called
the
well
of
goliath
in
syria
if
hulagu
army
had
won
that
battle
the
tartars
would
be
in
cairo
and
they
might
be
demanding
our
submission
instead
of
offering
us
an
alliance
but
you
think
it
is
safe
for
us
to
ally
ourselves
with
them
now
friar
mathieu
looked
sad
and
earnest
if
we
and
the
tartars
make
war
on
the
mamelukes
separately
we
will
be
defeated
separately
and
then
as
sure
as
winter
follows
summer
the
mamelukes
will
take
the
few
cities
and
castles
and
bits
of
land
our
crusaders
still
hold
in
outremer
and
all
those
generations
of
blood
spilled
for
god
and
the
holy
sepulchre
will
have
been
in
vain
now
simon
relief
was
total
he
felt
like
singing
for
joy
he
was
on
the
right
side
after
all
friar
mathieu
stopped
speaking
and
there
was
silence
in
the
hall
gradually
the
prelates
began
talking
but
there
were
no
shrill
outbursts
from
those
who
opposed
the
alliance
the
voices
of
all
were
subdued
respectful
the
pope
beckoned
friar
mathieu
to
his
chair
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
holding
him
by
the
arm
the
old
friar
slowly
lowered
himself
to
his
knees
bent
and
kissed
urban
ring
fra
tomasso
called
for
silence
and
urban
rose
and
blessed
the
assembly
simon
fell
to
his
knees
and
crossed
himself
thinking
i
stay
here
very
long
i
shall
get
enough
of
these
papal
blessings
to
absolve
me
from
punishment
for
a
lifetime
of
accompanied
by
and
a
phalanx
of
priests
the
holy
father
left
the
hall
by
the
side
door
the
arguments
in
the
hall
grew
louder
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
simon
saw
de
verceuil
hurrying
toward
the
front
door
his
small
mouth
tight
with
anger
a
protective
impulse
made
simon
look
about
for
friar
mathieu
there
he
was
at
the
center
of
a
small
group
of
friars
simon
started
toward
him
a
figure
blocked
his
way
even
though
he
touched
nothing
palpable
he
stopped
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
run
into
a
wall
and
the
face
he
was
looking
into
was
hard
as
granite
eyes
alight
with
the
icy
glow
of
diamonds
and
yet
it
was
not
a
cold
face
there
was
something
burning
deep
inside
there
a
fire
this
man
kept
hidden
most
of
the
time
that
fire
simon
felt
could
destroy
anything
in
its
path
if
allowed
to
blaze
forth
david
of
trebizond
was
silent
but
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
spoken
simon
heard
a
voice
say
know
you
and
you
are
my
enemy
simon
realized
that
david
had
intended
to
meet
him
like
this
intended
simon
to
seek
the
unspoken
threat
in
his
eyes
is
trying
to
frighten
simon
thought
and
was
angered
he
held
his
arm
still
but
he
knew
that
if
his
sword
had
been
buckled
at
his
side
nothing
could
have
stopped
him
from
reaching
for
it
simon
looked
the
man
up
and
down
taking
his
measure
david
half
a
head
shorter
than
simon
stood
relaxed
but
imposing
his
hands
hanging
at
his
sides
that
a
man
could
appear
at
once
so
composed
and
so
challenging
was
unique
man
is
no
trader
it
is
not
just
an
accident
that
he
has
come
here
to
speak
against
the
and
what
is
he
really
simon
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
said
in
gruff
italian
let
me
pass
messere
slowly
almost
insolently
david
drew
aside
forgive
me
your
signory
i
was
studying
your
face
he
spoke
italian
with
a
strange
accent
i
thought
i
might
have
seen
you
a
long
time
ago
but
that
is
not
possible
because
a
long
time
ago
you
would
have
been
a
child
does
that
mean
is
he
trying
to
remind
me
that
i
am
younger
than
he
is
i
am
sure
we
have
never
met
messere
simon
said
coldly
quite
right
your
signory
said
david
but
no
doubt
we
will
meet
again
simon
walked
past
the
man
from
trebizond
his
back
felt
terribly
exposed
and
he
held
his
shoulders
rigidly
he
felt
the
enmity
from
behind
him
as
sharp
as
a
dagger
point
xv
simon
guided
the
black
palfrey
carefully
down
the
road
into
the
wooded
valley
west
of
orvieto
the
path
like
the
streets
of
the
city
was
carved
from
rock
and
slippery
when
he
needed
to
think
simon
liked
to
get
out
of
doors
beyond
any
walls
and
to
feel
a
good
horse
moving
under
him
it
was
now
a
week
since
the
day
of
the
papal
council
and
its
inconclusive
outcome
troubled
him
sorely
the
pope
had
repeatedly
postponed
his
audience
with
the
tartar
ambassadors
pleading
a
sudden
excess
of
phlegm
the
tartars
were
growing
restless
pacing
the
courtyard
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
muttering
to
each
other
angrily
and
refusing
to
speak
to
anyone
else
the
longer
the
negotiations
were
delayed
the
greater
the
chance
they
would
fail
the
tartars
might
even
die
friar
mathieu
had
said
that
the
tartars
coming
from
a
land
so
distant
and
so
different
were
especially
vulnerable
to
the
diseases
of
europe
charging
de
pirenne
and
de
puys
to
keep
careful
watch
over
the
two
emissaries
simon
had
ridden
out
into
the
hills
to
think
what
he
might
do
to
help
his
cause
along
it
is
not
my
place
to
try
to
speed
things
up
my
task
is
to
guard
the
ambassadors
nothing
more
if
i
do
only
that
i
have
done
my
but
as
he
rode
out
into
the
valley
under
the
deep
shade
of
huge
old
olive
trees
he
heard
in
his
mind
king
louis
voice
you
too
simon
must
do
whatever
you
can
seize
any
opportunity
to
further
the
cause
of
the
king
louis
lay
prostrate
on
the
floor
of
the
sainte
chapelle
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
simon
impatient
to
speak
to
louis
about
his
mission
to
italy
knelt
on
the
stone
a
few
paces
away
from
the
long
form
the
two
of
them
were
the
entire
congregation
this
morning
far
outnumbered
by
the
twelve
canons
and
fourteen
chaplains
chanting
the
royal
mass
unable
to
keep
his
mind
on
the
mass
simon
kept
gazing
up
at
the
stained
glass
windows
since
the
age
of
eight
when
he
had
become
part
of
the
king
household
he
had
spent
hundreds
of
mornings
here
in
the
chapel
attached
to
the
royal
palace
but
the
building
still
amazed
him
the
walls
seemed
to
be
all
glass
filled
with
light
glowing
with
colors
bright
as
precious
stones
what
held
the
chapel
up
pierre
de
montreuil
the
king
master
builder
had
patiently
explained
the
principles
of
the
new
architecture
to
simon
but
though
simon
understood
the
logic
of
it
the
sainte
chapelle
most
beautiful
of
the
churches
of
the
île
de
la
cité
still
looked
miraculous
to
him
the
mass
ended
and
the
celebrants
proceeded
down
the
nave
of
the
chapel
two
by
two
dividing
when
they
came
to
king
louis
as
the
seine
divides
to
flow
around
the
cité
each
canon
and
chaplain
bowing
as
he
passed
the
prone
figure
when
they
were
all
gone
king
louis
slowly
began
to
push
himself
to
his
feet
simon
hurried
to
help
him
gripping
his
right
arm
with
both
hands
the
king
arm
was
thin
but
simon
felt
muscles
like
hard
ropes
moving
under
his
hands
though
almost
fifty
the
king
still
simon
knew
practiced
with
his
huge
sword
in
his
garden
age
had
not
weakened
him
though
a
mysterious
lifelong
ailment
sometimes
forced
him
to
take
to
his
bed
louis
looked
pained
this
is
not
one
of
my
good
days
for
walking
let
me
lean
on
you
simon
was
grateful
for
the
chance
to
help
king
louis
the
vest
of
coarse
horsehair
that
louis
wore
next
to
his
body
to
torment
his
flesh
as
penance
for
what
faults
simon
could
not
imagine
creaked
as
he
straightened
up
he
put
his
arm
over
simon
shoulder
and
simon
passed
an
arm
around
his
narrow
waist
he
looked
down
at
simon
with
round
sad
eyes
his
nose
was
large
but
his
cheeks
sunken
in
let
us
visit
the
crown
of
thorns
he
said
pointing
to
the
front
of
the
chapel
the
apse
louis
was
leaning
all
his
weight
on
simon
as
they
walked
slowly
up
to
the
wooden
gallery
behind
the
altar
where
the
crown
of
thorns
reposed
even
so
the
king
felt
light
how
could
a
man
be
at
once
so
strong
and
so
fragile
simon
wondered
there
was
barely
room
on
the
circular
wooden
stairway
for
them
to
climb
side
by
side
as
they
stood
before
the
sandalwood
chest
containing
the
reliquary
louis
took
his
arm
from
simon
shoulders
he
took
two
keys
from
the
purse
at
his
plain
black
belt
and
used
one
to
open
the
doors
of
the
chest
inner
doors
of
gold
set
with
jewels
blazed
in
the
light
from
the
stained
glass
windows
louis
opened
the
second
set
of
doors
with
the
other
key
and
with
simon
help
knelt
simon
saw
within
the
chest
lined
with
white
satin
a
gold
reliquary
that
contained
the
crown
of
thorns
it
was
shaped
like
a
king
crown
and
set
with
pearls
and
rubies
and
stood
on
a
gold
stem
and
base
like
a
chalice
simon
was
with
awe
almost
terror
at
the
sight
of
it
to
think
that
what
lay
within
this
gold
case
had
been
worn
by
jesus
christ
himself
twelve
centuries
ago
at
the
supreme
moment
of
his
life
his
death
still
kneeling
louis
slowly
drew
the
reliquary
out
of
the
chest
holding
it
with
both
hands
his
eyes
glowed
with
fervor
as
bright
as
the
pearls
simon
prayed
he
would
not
open
the
reliquary
the
sight
of
the
actual
thorns
that
pierced
jesus
head
would
surely
be
too
much
to
bear
louis
kissed
the
lid
of
the
case
and
held
it
out
to
simon
kiss
this
relic
of
christ
passion
simon
and
beg
his
blessing
on
your
mission
trembling
simon
touched
his
lips
to
the
cool
gold
surface
not
one
christian
in
a
hundred
thousand
had
been
this
close
to
the
crown
of
thorns
he
felt
ashamed
privileged
far
beyond
what
he
deserved
as
they
walked
together
out
of
the
chapel
louis
limping
and
leaning
on
simon
again
said
baldwin
the
french
emperor
of
constantinople
sold
us
two
crowns
after
michael
paleologos
drove
him
out
i
bought
the
crown
of
thorns
and
my
brother
charles
bought
the
title
of
emperor
of
constantinople
which
of
us
i
wonder
made
the
better
bargain
simon
thought
did
count
charles
actually
hope
to
conquer
constantinople
and
if
so
what
did
these
dealings
with
the
tartars
have
to
do
with
it
is
it
your
wish
sire
as
your
brother
count
charles
has
told
me
that
i
should
guard
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
when
they
arrive
in
italy
he
asked
louis
stopped
walking
they
were
almost
to
the
doorway
of
the
chapel
he
turned
his
round
eyes
on
simon
oh
yes
it
is
very
much
my
wish
his
thin
fingers
squeezed
shoulder
for
more
than
twenty
years
ever
since
i
took
the
crusading
vow
i
have
wanted
one
thing
above
all
else
to
win
jerusalem
back
for
christendom
i
led
an
army
into
egypt
and
it
was
god
will
that
the
mamelukes
defeated
me
will
and
amalric
de
gobignon
thought
simon
now
with
the
help
of
the
tartars
we
could
wrest
the
holy
land
from
the
saracens
hands
louis
said
but
if
you
wish
to
ally
yourself
with
the
tartars
sire
should
i
not
bring
the
ambassadors
directly
to
you
instead
of
to
the
pope
no
i
can
not
make
a
treaty
with
the
tartars
without
pope
permission
only
the
holy
father
can
proclaim
a
crusade
if
he
refuses
to
do
that
i
can
not
recruit
an
army
to
join
with
the
tartars
to
rescue
the
holy
land
even
if
he
does
declare
a
crusade
raising
an
army
will
be
terribly
hard
many
of
those
who
went
with
me
last
time
and
endured
our
terrible
defeat
and
survived
with
god
help
have
told
me
they
will
not
go
again
or
send
their
sons
i
must
have
his
holiness
full
support
king
louis
turned
toward
him
fully
now
and
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
you
must
help
me
simon
i
am
asking
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
to
represent
the
cause
of
the
alliance
at
the
court
of
the
pope
and
friar
mathieu
will
be
there
to
testify
that
the
tartars
may
yet
be
won
to
christianity
and
you
too
simon
must
do
whatever
you
can
seize
any
opportunity
to
further
the
cause
of
the
alliance
simon
looked
into
the
king
eyes
their
blue
was
slightly
faded
and
age
and
care
had
etched
red
streaks
in
the
whites
simon
whole
frame
was
shaken
by
an
overwhelming
love
for
the
man
sire
i
will
do
anything
everything
louis
nodded
i
know
how
you
have
suffered
all
your
life
because
of
the
ill
deeds
of
one
i
shall
not
name
i
have
tried
to
shield
you
from
being
unjustly
punished
but
even
a
king
can
not
control
the
hearts
of
men
in
the
end
only
you
can
win
back
for
the
house
of
gobignon
its
place
among
the
great
names
of
france
this
alliance
with
the
tartars
and
what
follows
from
it
the
liberation
of
jerusalem
can
help
you
restore
your
honor
could
a
man
have
more
than
one
father
simon
wondered
surely
king
louis
had
done
more
than
anyone
else
to
make
him
the
man
he
was
today
i
will
work
for
the
alliance
sire
he
said
not
for
my
family
honor
alone
but
for
you
for
king
louis
he
would
guard
the
tartars
with
his
life
for
king
louis
he
would
do
anything
his
horse
slowed
down
to
climb
as
the
road
rose
along
a
steep
slope
opposite
orvieto
green
with
vineyards
friar
mathieu
had
made
a
better
witness
than
david
of
trebizond
simon
thought
but
the
italian
cardinals
remained
vociferous
in
their
opposition
to
the
alliance
the
pope
might
be
french
but
he
had
to
live
with
the
italians
cardinal
ugolini
was
the
key
to
it
he
it
seemed
was
the
leader
of
the
italian
party
in
the
college
of
cardinals
he
was
the
cardinal
camerlengo
after
all
someone
must
try
to
reach
ugolini
it
could
not
be
de
verceuil
either
with
his
arrogance
and
bad
manners
even
if
the
man
were
to
try
to
talk
to
ugolini
which
was
unlikely
he
would
doubtless
make
an
even
greater
enemy
of
him
friar
mathieu
should
do
it
he
could
speak
to
ugolini
as
one
churchman
to
another
but
then
simon
shook
his
head
so
many
of
these
princes
of
the
church
looked
down
on
the
mendicant
friars
any
simon
rode
up
the
hillside
debating
with
himself
just
before
the
road
passed
between
two
rounded
peaks
it
widened
so
that
carters
could
pass
each
other
simon
swung
his
leg
over
the
saddle
and
stepped
down
from
his
horse
to
enjoy
the
view
against
the
hillside
under
a
peaked
roof
a
statue
of
saint
sebastian
writhed
his
body
pierced
by
arrows
the
agony
depicted
on
the
saint
face
made
the
countryside
look
all
the
more
serene
patron
saint
of
archers
let
no
more
harm
come
to
innocent
people
from
my
simon
turned
to
look
at
orvieto
it
was
like
a
city
from
some
tale
of
faeries
a
fantastic
island
on
its
huge
rock
what
was
it
the
italians
called
that
stone
tufa
most
of
the
churches
and
palaces
and
houses
of
orvieto
were
also
built
of
tufa
beautiful
the
clatter
of
hooves
interrupted
his
thoughts
he
looked
up
to
see
four
horsemen
approaching
from
the
north
followed
by
two
heavily
laden
baggage
mules
simon
mood
changed
at
once
from
contemplation
to
tense
alertness
his
hands
moved
to
check
the
position
of
his
sword
and
dagger
making
sure
he
could
draw
them
quickly
you
had
to
be
careful
of
strangers
in
a
strange
country
as
the
men
rode
closer
he
saw
that
they
also
had
short
swords
and
daggers
hanging
at
their
sides
closer
still
and
he
saw
long
swords
slung
over
their
backs
and
crossbows
hanging
from
their
saddles
annoyed
with
himself
for
feeling
afraid
he
yet
followed
the
dictate
of
prudence
and
mounted
his
own
horse
he
kept
his
hand
near
but
not
on
the
jeweled
hilt
of
his
scimitar
as
the
men
rode
closer
highwaymen
would
be
willing
to
kill
him
just
for
that
precious
sword
the
man
in
the
lead
wore
a
soft
velvet
cap
that
draped
down
one
side
of
his
head
under
it
simon
saw
was
curly
black
hair
shot
through
with
white
the
stranger
grizzled
mustache
was
so
thick
as
to
hide
his
mouth
but
courteously
enough
he
touched
his
hand
to
his
cap
where
his
visor
would
be
if
he
were
wearing
a
helmet
buon
giorno
signore
he
said
in
a
deep
but
neutral
voice
simon
returned
his
salutation
and
the
muttered
greetings
of
the
others
thinking
he
really
should
ask
who
they
were
where
bound
and
on
what
business
in
france
especially
in
his
own
domains
he
would
not
have
hesitated
but
then
in
france
he
rarely
traveled
alone
these
men
seemed
not
bent
on
troubling
him
and
it
seemed
wiser
not
to
trouble
them
the
other
three
men
in
the
party
looked
younger
than
the
leader
and
there
was
insolence
almost
a
challenge
in
their
dark
eyes
as
they
looked
him
over
and
rode
on
it
took
an
effort
of
will
on
simon
part
not
to
move
his
hand
closer
to
his
sword
but
he
sat
until
they
were
past
and
on
their
way
down
into
the
valley
what
business
would
bravos
like
that
have
in
orvieto
perhaps
they
had
come
to
join
the
monaldeschi
or
the
filippeschi
in
their
feuding
simon
felt
beleaguered
at
the
thought
of
more
bravos
coming
into
town
orvieto
was
already
full
of
armed
men
serving
the
local
families
as
well
as
others
in
the
retinues
of
the
churchmen
who
had
come
here
with
the
pope
uneasiness
made
his
spine
tingle
anything
that
added
to
disorder
in
orvieto
made
it
a
more
dangerous
place
for
the
tartar
ambassadors
must
get
this
question
of
the
alliance
settled
someone
should
speak
to
cardinal
ugolini
and
find
out
if
anything
would
persuade
him
to
withdraw
his
objections
simon
wondered
why
de
verceuil
had
not
already
attempted
it
could
meet
with
ugolini
he
knows
who
i
am
they
all
do
since
the
pope
greeted
me
publicly
all
i
have
to
do
is
send
thierry
around
with
a
note
asking
for
an
at
once
he
began
trying
to
persuade
himself
to
forget
the
idea
how
could
he
talk
a
cardinal
into
changing
his
mind
about
such
a
great
matter
ridiculous
what
could
he
possibly
do
or
say
and
what
if
this
cardinal
were
one
who
knew
of
the
shame
of
the
house
of
gobignon
any
cardinal
ugolini
shrugged
with
his
bushy
gray
eyebrows
as
well
as
with
his
shoulders
the
question
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
count
now
it
is
up
to
his
holiness
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
but
what
have
you
and
i
to
say
to
each
other
the
solar
the
room
on
the
third
floor
of
the
palace
was
bright
with
light
that
streamed
in
through
white
glass
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
thick
red
and
black
rug
the
walls
decorated
with
frescoes
of
angels
and
saints
lavishly
bedecked
with
gold
leaf
simon
eye
kept
returning
to
a
voluptuous
eve
no
part
of
her
nude
body
hidden
by
the
leaves
or
branches
artists
usually
deployed
for
sake
she
was
handing
a
golden
fruit
it
might
have
been
an
orange
or
a
lemon
rather
than
an
apple
to
a
muscular
and
also
fully
displayed
adam
simon
found
them
disturbingly
sensual
though
they
dealt
with
a
religious
subject
and
he
was
surprised
that
a
cardinal
should
have
such
pictures
on
his
walls
ugolini
small
elaborately
carved
oak
table
set
beside
a
window
was
polished
and
quite
bare
there
were
no
books
or
parchments
anywhere
in
the
large
room
simon
suspected
that
the
cardinal
used
this
room
to
receive
visitors
but
did
little
work
in
it
a
star
was
carved
in
the
back
of
the
cardinal
chair
above
his
head
simon
sat
in
a
small
armless
chair
made
somewhat
comfortable
by
the
cushion
on
its
seat
i
have
come
in
the
hope
of
presenting
to
you
our
french
point
of
view
on
this
proposed
alliance
said
simon
that
sounded
impressive
enough
and
do
you
speak
for
france
young
man
not
officially
your
eminence
said
simon
flustered
i
mean
only
that
i
french
and
that
both
king
louis
and
his
brother
count
charles
have
deigned
to
share
their
views
with
me
ugolini
leaned
forward
his
expression
was
earnest
enough
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
gave
simon
the
uneasy
feeling
that
the
cardinal
was
laughing
at
him
i
am
eager
to
hear
what
you
have
learned
from
the
king
and
his
brother
quite
simply
simon
said
they
look
on
the
advent
of
the
tartars
as
a
golden
opportunity
one
might
say
a
opportunity
to
do
away
with
the
threat
of
the
saracens
once
and
for
all
ugolini
nodded
thoughtfully
so
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
rescuing
the
holy
places
i
giving
away
something
i
should
not
simon
asked
himself
suddenly
it
was
count
charles
he
now
recalled
who
had
said
that
the
alliance
might
make
possible
the
complete
destruction
of
islam
am
in
this
over
my
but
he
had
to
go
on
the
saracens
believe
they
are
called
upon
to
spread
their
religion
by
the
sword
they
will
continue
to
make
war
on
us
unless
we
conquer
them
ugolini
lifted
a
finger
like
a
master
admonishing
a
poorly
prepared
student
the
prophet
muhammad
calls
upon
his
followers
to
their
faith
with
the
sword
but
he
explicitly
states
that
conversions
made
at
sword
point
are
worthless
and
commands
that
christians
and
jews
who
remain
devoted
to
their
own
worship
be
left
in
peace
he
sat
back
and
gazed
as
happily
at
simon
as
at
some
mouse
who
had
the
whole
granary
to
himself
i
can
not
dispute
you
your
eminence
truly
i
am
quite
ignorant
of
the
mohammedan
faith
why
study
false
religions
that
had
been
the
attitude
of
his
teachers
ugolini
nodded
his
side
whiskers
quivering
you
and
most
of
europe
but
jerusalem
bethlehem
nazareth
those
precious
places
we
hear
about
in
the
gospel
simon
argued
we
can
not
leave
them
in
the
hands
of
christ
enemies
the
cardinal
shook
his
head
christ
enemies
indeed
you
know
little
of
them
count
the
muslim
holy
book
the
koran
reveres
jesus
and
his
mother
mary
our
sacred
places
are
sacred
to
them
also
emperor
frederic
von
hohenstaufen
had
the
right
idea
he
made
a
treaty
with
the
saracens
if
the
crusaders
in
syria
had
not
broken
it
pilgrims
would
be
happily
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
our
lord
to
this
day
simon
remembered
the
hatred
in
the
voices
of
de
verceuil
and
le
gros
when
they
spoke
of
the
house
of
hohenstaufen
the
crusades
were
a
mistake
from
the
very
beginning
ugolini
went
on
having
heard
harrowing
tales
from
men
who
had
been
there
of
king
disastrous
defeat
fourteen
years
before
in
egypt
simon
found
it
hard
to
challenge
ugolini
assertion
but
history
could
not
be
undone
and
with
the
help
of
the
tartars
might
this
not
be
the
one
great
crusade
that
would
make
any
more
crusades
unnecessary
we
still
hold
acre
and
tripoli
and
antioch
and
cyprus
simon
said
the
templars
and
the
hospitallers
have
their
castles
along
the
coast
think
of
all
the
men
who
have
died
just
to
get
and
keep
that
much
and
if
we
do
not
beat
the
saracens
now
they
will
surely
choose
their
moment
and
take
those
last
footholds
of
ours
ugolini
stood
up
and
walked
slowly
red
satin
robe
whispering
to
a
small
door
behind
his
table
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
and
ugolini
looked
into
the
next
room
was
there
someone
in
there
simon
wondered
listening
to
this
conversation
am
getting
in
deeper
and
deeper
what
if
my
words
could
somehow
be
used
against
me
or
against
the
alliance
i
should
never
have
come
whatever
he
saw
beyond
the
door
seemed
to
satisfy
ugolini
he
turned
smiling
count
i
am
going
to
suggest
something
to
you
that
i
am
sure
will
shock
you
at
first
perhaps
we
should
leave
the
holy
land
in
peace
simon
felt
troubled
but
having
heard
much
the
same
thing
from
his
parents
and
indeed
from
some
of
the
knights
at
the
royal
palace
when
king
louis
was
out
of
hearing
he
was
not
shocked
but
for
himself
he
had
never
been
able
to
reconcile
such
views
with
his
sense
of
his
obligations
as
a
christian
even
so
he
began
to
see
why
de
verceuil
had
spoken
of
ugolini
as
if
he
were
a
heretic
how
could
a
man
with
such
opinions
get
to
be
a
cardinal
to
leave
the
holy
land
in
the
hands
of
the
infidels
your
eminence
would
it
not
betray
our
lord
himself
ugolini
unperturbed
continued
to
smile
as
he
walked
toward
simon
the
whole
world
belongs
to
god
if
our
savior
wished
the
places
where
he
was
born
died
buried
and
rose
again
to
be
occupied
by
christian
knights
from
europe
he
would
have
permitted
it
to
happen
as
it
is
i
truly
believe
that
if
we
sent
every
man
in
christendom
to
fight
in
outremer
we
could
not
take
jerusalem
back
and
we
could
not
prevent
the
crusader
strongholds
from
falling
to
the
muslims
the
infidels
as
you
call
them
are
defending
their
own
lands
and
a
people
fighting
for
their
homeland
is
always
stronger
than
an
invader
another
crusade
even
with
tartar
help
would
be
a
tragic
waste
ugolini
stood
before
the
seated
simon
and
such
was
the
difference
in
their
heights
that
their
eyes
were
almost
on
a
level
simon
wanted
to
stand
but
somehow
he
dared
not
move
he
was
beginning
to
feel
desperate
he
had
walked
into
a
trap
that
he
had
not
anticipated
he
had
feared
that
he
would
not
persuade
the
cardinal
he
had
not
imagined
that
the
cardinal
might
persuade
him
but
you
would
abandon
the
christians
who
are
there
now
to
be
overrun
and
slaughtered
by
the
turks
simon
asked
he
reproached
himself
it
almost
sounded
as
if
he
were
conceding
that
there
should
be
no
more
crusades
the
cardinal
shook
his
head
i
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
bring
them
home
he
sighed
and
turned
away
you
are
a
most
impressive
young
man
count
simon
i
am
glad
we
have
had
this
chance
to
hear
each
other
out
simon
felt
deeply
shaken
as
if
he
had
been
galloping
in
a
tournament
and
had
been
ignominiously
unhorsed
he
had
been
foolish
to
think
he
could
sway
a
man
of
ugolini
eminence
and
intelligence
courtesy
demanded
he
supposed
that
he
take
his
leave
he
could
only
hope
that
some
of
what
he
said
would
sink
in
and
influence
the
cardinal
thinking
in
the
future
ugolini
standing
before
him
thrust
his
small
hand
suddenly
under
simon
nose
causing
simon
to
sit
back
startled
in
his
chair
then
simon
realized
the
cardinal
was
offering
him
his
ring
to
kiss
he
slid
out
of
the
chair
and
dropped
to
one
knee
he
touched
his
lips
to
the
round
blue
sapphire
which
betokened
ugolini
rank
as
a
cardinal
while
he
still
knelt
the
door
behind
ugolini
swung
open
feeling
awkward
simon
started
to
scramble
to
his
feet
as
he
did
so
he
saw
the
woman
her
features
were
delicate
her
lips
full
her
eyes
dark
and
challenging
she
wore
a
yellow
gown
tied
under
her
bosom
by
an
orange
ribbon
simon
stared
at
her
until
he
realized
he
was
in
a
position
that
must
look
perfectly
ridiculous
he
shut
his
mouth
he
slowly
straightened
buon
giorno
my
dear
sophia
said
cardinal
ugolini
let
me
introduce
our
distinguished
visitor
he
first
presented
simon
to
the
young
woman
and
then
presented
her
to
him
my
niece
sophia
orfali
daughter
of
my
sister
who
lives
at
siracusa
in
sicily
it
registered
somewhere
in
simon
mind
that
sicily
was
part
of
the
hohenstaufen
kingdom
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
whether
sophia
was
of
gentle
birth
it
struck
him
with
much
greater
impact
that
she
was
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
woman
swallowing
hard
he
bowed
over
her
hand
his
fingertips
pressing
into
her
palm
felt
as
if
they
were
burning
his
lips
touched
the
back
of
her
hand
lightly
his
eyes
filled
with
smooth
skin
and
the
pale
blue
tint
of
delicate
veins
as
he
stepped
back
he
noticed
that
she
gave
off
a
faint
scent
of
oranges
she
stood
looking
at
him
with
a
small
smile
waiting
for
him
to
speak
all
sorts
of
absurd
phrases
and
sentences
flooded
into
his
mind
outrageous
compliments
declarations
of
love
the
upper
part
of
her
gown
was
pulled
tight
and
he
had
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
breasts
his
face
burned
and
his
throat
felt
parched
buon
giorno
signora
he
choked
out
it
is
a
great
honor
to
meet
you
her
fine
arched
eyebrows
lifted
slightly
and
she
answered
him
in
french
why
do
you
not
speak
your
native
language
monseigneur
simon
cheeks
burned
hotter
i
assumed
you
would
prefer
italian
madame
she
smiled
and
simon
felt
there
was
a
shade
of
scorn
in
the
smile
i
would
prefer
french
monseigneur
to
italian
as
speak
it
forgive
me
madame
simon
whispered
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
she
said
airily
simon
thought
surely
the
cardinal
would
reprove
his
niece
for
her
unkindness
but
he
stood
there
beaming
like
a
master
showing
off
a
remarkably
gifted
scholar
lady
thought
simon
pray
you
be
merciful
to
ringing
a
small
bell
that
stood
on
his
desk
much
like
the
one
friar
tomasso
had
used
to
keep
order
at
the
pope
court
ugolini
summoned
one
of
the
priests
on
his
household
staff
and
simon
his
head
still
spinning
from
his
unexpected
encounter
with
sophia
found
himself
being
escorted
out
of
the
cardinal
mansion
as
simon
and
the
priest
were
walking
through
the
gallery
that
led
to
the
main
entrance
the
outer
door
swung
open
and
a
large
gray
boarhound
trotted
in
it
was
with
long
ears
a
pointed
aristocratic
muzzle
and
intelligent
brown
eyes
the
dog
jumped
at
simon
resting
his
forepaws
on
simon
chest
and
looking
up
at
him
as
if
studying
his
face
simon
who
had
played
and
hunted
with
hounds
all
his
life
took
an
immediate
liking
to
the
dog
he
scratched
the
back
of
the
animal
head
down
scipio
said
a
deep
voice
and
simon
saw
the
hound
master
the
same
swarthy
man
with
grizzled
curly
hair
and
thick
mustache
he
had
met
on
the
road
from
the
north
three
days
before
the
one
leading
the
little
company
of
bravos
again
that
tense
besieged
feeling
came
over
simon
the
same
as
when
he
met
this
man
on
the
road
there
was
too
much
going
on
in
orvieto
almost
all
of
it
surprising
and
much
of
it
seemingly
dangerous
if
he
wanted
to
be
sure
the
tartars
were
safe
he
would
have
to
give
up
sleeping
the
dog
dropped
to
all
fours
and
stood
beside
his
master
the
other
did
not
acknowledge
having
seen
simon
before
forgive
us
signore
i
fear
scipio
has
gotten
dust
on
your
tunic
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
said
simon
he
brushed
off
his
tunic
do
you
serve
cardinal
ugolini
this
time
he
would
not
let
the
man
pass
without
questioning
him
i
am
giancarlo
signore
a
servant
of
messer
david
of
trebizond
he
bowed
deeply
feeling
angry
because
he
was
sure
he
was
being
lied
to
simon
wanted
to
ask
about
the
men
with
giancarlo
on
the
road
but
decided
it
was
better
not
to
appear
too
suspicious
them
think
i
am
a
naive
young
nobleman
easily
gulled
not
so
far
from
the
truth
are
you
also
from
trebizond
messer
giancarlo
the
dark
brown
eyes
were
watchful
i
am
a
neapolitan
signore
messer
david
hired
me
when
he
arrived
in
italy
it
is
david
of
trebizond
who
is
bringing
bravos
into
the
city
what
for
out
on
the
street
simon
looked
at
the
spot
where
the
crossbowmen
had
spilled
two
men
blood
he
felt
a
weary
anger
two
lives
cut
off
because
of
that
fool
de
verceuil
and
his
vanity
where
the
men
had
been
shot
there
now
stood
rows
of
bowls
and
pots
from
small
to
large
they
were
painted
white
with
pretty
floral
designs
in
red
blue
and
green
a
woman
sat
on
the
ground
beside
the
display
painting
a
freshly
baked
jug
she
looked
up
at
simon
then
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
stood
bowing
deeply
fine
vases
and
plates
your
signory
the
earthenware
of
orvieto
is
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
simon
smiled
no
doubt
but
not
today
thank
you
he
must
remember
to
bring
some
samples
back
to
gobignon
though
he
thought
it
was
ware
and
it
might
give
the
potters
of
some
good
ideas
he
turned
and
stared
back
at
the
mansion
a
great
cube
of
the
same
tufa
as
the
rock
on
which
orvieto
stood
from
that
rooftop
david
of
trebizond
had
watched
the
heckling
the
throwing
of
garbage
and
dung
the
sudden
killings
simon
almost
expected
to
see
david
appear
on
the
roof
now
but
it
remained
empty
the
cardinal
mansion
remained
flat
and
featureless
revealing
nothing
simon
sighed
longingly
for
another
glimpse
of
the
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
and
he
could
not
stand
here
any
longer
sighing
again
he
walked
away
xvi
the
door
leading
from
cardinal
ugolini
private
cabinet
to
the
solar
swung
back
and
david
came
in
as
always
when
she
first
caught
sight
of
david
sophia
felt
her
heart
give
a
little
jongleur
somersault
she
loved
the
look
of
his
hard
eyes
with
their
suggestion
of
weariness
at
having
seen
too
much
but
now
those
eyes
were
turned
toward
her
and
they
were
narrowed
angrily
why
were
you
rude
to
him
his
harsh
tone
when
she
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
hurt
her
she
had
no
ready
answer
for
him
to
give
herself
time
to
think
she
walked
to
the
small
chair
simon
had
occupied
and
sat
down
in
it
cardinal
ugolini
sitting
at
his
carved
oak
table
spoke
up
sophia
put
him
in
his
place
by
demonstrating
to
him
that
she
could
speak
his
language
better
than
he
could
speak
italian
david
there
is
no
end
to
the
arroganzia
of
these
french
david
was
still
looking
at
sophia
the
midday
light
streaming
through
the
white
panes
of
glass
threw
sharp
shadows
under
his
cheekbones
giving
him
the
gaunt
look
of
a
desert
saint
breath
how
i
would
like
to
paint
his
picture
at
least
i
could
have
that
much
of
do
you
think
i
wanted
you
to
meet
him
so
that
you
could
teach
him
better
manners
david
demanded
of
course
not
she
said
but
you
do
not
understand
men
david
laugh
was
as
harsh
as
the
planes
of
his
face
oh
yes
sophia
went
on
impatiently
you
have
always
lived
with
men
and
you
lead
men
and
fight
against
men
but
you
do
not
understand
how
christian
men
especially
frenchmen
and
italians
feel
about
women
you
know
nothing
for
example
of
courtois
yes
said
ugolini
the
head
of
every
young
french
nobleman
is
full
of
two
things
honor
and
courtois
david
looked
from
ugolini
to
sophia
and
back
again
what
is
this
courtois
he
demanded
i
should
know
about
it
why
have
you
not
told
me
ugolini
lifted
his
shoulders
in
a
gesture
that
reminded
sophia
of
a
shopkeeper
on
the
mese
my
dear
fellow
we
can
not
guess
where
the
gaps
are
in
your
knowledge
of
the
christian
world
that
is
why
it
is
so
dangerous
for
you
to
go
about
in
public
david
held
out
his
hands
in
appeal
you
have
seen
me
testify
before
the
pope
himself
how
can
you
still
be
afraid
he
curled
his
fingers
in
toward
himself
inviting
ugolini
to
go
on
tell
me
about
courtly
love
graceful
his
gestures
it
was
begun
many
years
ago
by
a
number
of
noble
ladies
of
france
and
especially
queen
eleanor
of
aquitaine
who
led
an
absolutely
scandalous
life
ugolini
said
she
married
the
king
of
france
accompanied
him
on
crusade
costumed
as
an
amazon
rode
in
jerusalem
jerusalem
divorced
the
king
of
france
married
the
king
of
england
had
lovers
uncounted
besides
i
had
been
born
into
the
nobility
i
might
have
been
a
woman
like
sophia
thought
wistfully
david
shook
his
head
as
if
buzzing
flies
circled
it
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
simon
de
gobignon
as
his
excellency
said
this
simon
comes
out
of
a
world
shaped
by
courtly
love
sophia
answered
there
are
many
strict
rules
about
how
men
and
ladies
should
behave
toward
one
another
one
of
the
most
important
is
that
the
woman
rules
the
man
david
smiled
thinly
she
had
rarely
seen
a
full
open
smile
on
his
face
but
she
remembered
what
a
glorious
sight
it
had
been
and
wished
he
would
smile
that
way
now
so
by
scorning
the
way
he
spoke
italian
you
believe
you
are
making
yourself
more
attractive
to
him
far
better
than
i
would
by
letting
him
put
his
foot
on
my
neck
the
way
your
harem
women
do
you
know
nothing
about
our
women
but
his
eyes
were
crinkled
with
laughter
less
than
i
do
about
your
courtly
lovers
and
what
do
you
think
of
italian
better
than
his
she
said
and
was
rewarded
with
a
broader
smile
she
felt
a
warmth
inside
as
if
her
heart
were
melting
trained
from
childhood
to
hide
her
feelings
she
turned
her
gaze
toward
the
wall
paintings
of
the
nude
adam
and
eve
a
loud
knock
shook
the
outer
door
of
the
solar
at
ugolini
summons
the
door
swung
inward
sophia
briefly
saw
the
tops
of
the
palm
and
lemon
trees
in
the
inner
court
beyond
the
arches
and
columns
of
the
galleria
then
the
door
closed
again
behind
lorenzo
scipio
at
his
side
he
carried
a
small
parchment
scroll
in
his
hand
i
met
the
count
de
gobignon
at
the
entry
way
just
now
he
said
three
days
ago
i
was
bringing
men
back
from
castel
viscardo
and
i
encountered
him
not
knowing
then
who
he
was
on
the
road
david
muttered
something
in
the
saracen
tongue
it
could
have
been
a
curse
or
a
prayer
but
before
he
could
speak
ugolini
fist
struck
the
desk
he
saw
you
bringing
bravos
to
orvieto
he
cried
at
lorenzo
you
will
get
us
all
killed
i
see
it
now
de
gobignon
did
not
come
here
to
persuade
me
to
change
my
mind
about
the
tartars
he
came
here
to
spy
on
us
his
voice
was
shrill
with
fear
scipio
growled
at
the
cardinal
and
lorenzo
slapped
him
sharply
on
the
head
then
on
the
rump
the
dog
fell
silent
at
once
and
trotted
off
to
the
corner
of
the
room
farthest
from
lorenzo
ugolini
and
david
both
eyed
the
animal
with
distaste
perhaps
the
count
should
be
killed
then
said
david
before
he
can
use
against
us
what
he
has
learned
no
please
do
kill
him
sophia
felt
an
urge
to
cry
out
to
do
something
to
protect
simon
and
with
that
protective
feeling
she
saw
him
again
the
glossy
dark
brown
hair
that
hung
in
waves
almost
to
his
shoulders
the
startling
blue
eyes
in
an
angular
intelligent
face
the
tall
slender
body
and
that
name
simon
was
there
an
omen
of
some
sort
in
that
did
not
this
simon
even
look
somewhat
like
her
painting
of
saint
simon
stylites
carried
with
her
all
the
way
from
constantinople
as
the
saint
might
have
looked
when
he
was
a
young
man
as
sophia
orfali
meeting
the
count
de
gobignon
she
had
felt
almost
half
in
love
with
simon
how
can
you
talk
of
killing
him
ugolini
cried
his
voice
almost
cracking
the
french
cardinals
and
their
would
tear
the
city
apart
it
might
be
enough
to
bring
charles
or
king
louis
himself
down
here
with
an
army
sooner
or
later
they
would
trace
it
back
to
us
and
then
if
you
want
to
know
your
fate
his
finger
moved
in
turn
from
david
to
lorenzo
to
sophia
go
see
what
they
do
in
the
piazza
del
cattedrale
to
that
poor
wretch
this
count
captured
sophia
felt
a
sickening
falling
sensation
in
her
stomach
at
this
reminder
of
the
danger
she
was
in
usually
she
managed
to
keep
calm
by
refusing
to
think
about
what
would
happen
if
she
were
caught
she
cursed
ugolini
for
taking
her
defenses
by
surprise
lorenzo
whirled
suddenly
on
ugolini
get
hold
of
yourself
cardinal
how
can
a
man
think
with
you
shrieking
away
like
a
crazy
old
nonna
for
you
she
thought
i
am
a
prince
of
the
roman
catholic
church
ugolini
shouted
you
will
show
respect
unabashed
lorenzo
turned
to
david
despite
his
hysterics
i
do
think
the
cardinal
is
right
if
de
gobignon
were
murdered
the
city
would
be
in
an
uproar
we
could
not
go
on
with
our
work
dear
god
why
did
you
send
these
people
into
my
life
ugolini
groaned
lorenzo
offered
the
scroll
in
his
hand
to
david
this
prince
of
the
church
has
been
making
such
a
commotion
i
nearly
forgot
this
a
man
with
a
clerical
tonsure
brought
it
to
the
door
just
after
the
young
count
left
david
dagger
seemed
to
leap
into
his
hand
the
man
could
move
so
fast
sophia
thought
he
cut
the
black
ribbon
tying
the
scroll
and
slipped
the
dagger
back
into
its
scabbard
he
unrolled
the
parchment
and
studied
it
with
a
frown
this
is
in
latin
he
said
handing
the
scroll
to
ugolini
and
breathing
heavily
ugolini
took
the
scroll
and
read
it
moving
his
finger
along
the
lines
he
shut
his
eyes
as
if
in
pain
whatever
this
message
was
thought
sophia
it
was
upsetting
him
still
more
ugolini
looked
up
with
eyes
it
is
from
fra
tomasso
he
invites
you
to
visit
him
at
the
convent
of
the
dominicans
he
says
he
wants
to
hear
more
about
your
travels
david
nodded
excellent
i
have
been
wanting
to
find
a
way
to
meet
privately
with
him
ugolini
threw
the
paper
to
the
floor
and
shook
both
fists
mother
of
god
do
you
not
understand
that
this
is
a
trap
the
dominicans
are
in
charge
of
the
inquisition
they
are
called
the
domini
canes
the
hounds
of
the
lord
they
can
heresy
david
laughed
they
will
not
smell
it
on
me
i
am
a
good
muslim
though
sophia
felt
inclined
to
share
ugolini
fear
she
delighted
in
david
humorous
courage
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
golden
head
as
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
light
from
the
window
shining
on
him
that
will
find
even
easier
to
detect
than
heresy
said
ugolini
a
small
amused
smile
played
about
david
lips
do
you
not
think
i
have
prepared
myself
for
such
a
conversation
we
need
a
respected
man
who
can
write
letters
and
give
sermons
warning
christendom
against
the
tartars
if
fra
tomasso
can
be
convinced
the
tartars
are
dangerous
and
if
i
can
offer
him
something
he
wants
badly
enough
he
might
be
the
man
he
and
his
fellow
dominicans
will
eat
you
alive
ugolini
moaned
i
can
accomplish
nothing
hiding
here
in
your
palace
david
gazed
down
at
the
cardinal
unruffled
sophia
sat
perfectly
still
hands
folded
in
her
lap
looking
down
at
ugolini
beautiful
persian
carpet
but
the
quarreling
made
her
writhe
inwardly
if
they
could
not
agree
if
they
were
not
careful
in
their
planning
if
they
started
to
hate
one
another
they
surely
would
end
by
being
torn
to
pieces
on
the
public
scaffold
let
us
speak
about
the
young
french
count
she
said
he
too
might
be
a
man
we
can
use
i
did
my
best
to
attract
him
to
me
today
he
thinks
there
is
hope
of
my
seducing
simon
he
will
not
be
so
quick
to
want
to
kill
david
eyes
held
hers
for
a
long
moment
that
is
what
i
want
you
to
do
that
was
why
i
was
angry
not
understanding
this
courtly
love
his
face
was
somber
that
is
what
i
brought
you
here
for
she
nodded
thinking
only
you
could
be
my
lover
there
would
be
nothing
courtly
about
it
and
it
would
bring
us
both
great
but
only
a
moment
ago
had
she
not
been
thinking
of
simon
fearing
for
simon
life
had
she
not
almost
felt
love
for
him
is
happening
to
me
her
hands
in
her
lap
clutched
at
each
other
she
felt
dizzy
it
had
happened
so
easily
so
quickly
was
she
becoming
more
than
one
person
like
someone
possessed
by
spirits
how
could
you
know
who
you
were
unless
you
had
a
place
and
were
firmly
attached
to
other
people
now
looking
at
david
she
was
aware
of
the
feelings
simon
had
aroused
in
her
as
if
they
were
the
feelings
of
another
person
sophia
karaiannides
wanted
david
her
longing
for
him
had
been
growing
in
her
ever
since
their
eyes
first
met
in
manfred
audience
hall
months
before
what
is
troubling
you
david
said
frowning
she
felt
flustered
nothing
when
he
looked
skeptical
she
added
i
am
not
certain
how
he
feels
about
me
david
glowered
at
her
she
tried
to
read
his
expression
he
looked
angry
was
he
angry
at
her
for
being
willing
to
take
simon
as
a
lover
probably
thinks
i
am
nothing
but
a
she
liked
to
think
of
herself
as
a
woman
who
was
able
to
move
easily
in
many
circles
a
woman
who
involved
herself
in
affairs
of
state
but
was
she
not
deceiving
herself
was
it
not
that
all
men
valued
her
for
was
her
body
in
bed
and
david
did
not
even
want
that
he
just
wanted
to
use
her
body
to
ensnare
simon
de
gobignon
then
why
did
he
look
at
her
so
angrily
how
will
you
find
out
what
he
feels
for
you
david
said
will
you
wait
for
him
to
make
the
next
move
i
will
send
him
a
small
favor
something
he
recognizes
as
mine
then
we
will
see
how
interested
he
is
good
said
david
briskly
as
if
dismissing
her
he
turned
to
lorenzo
speaking
of
ladies
and
love
our
young
friend
rachel
is
still
living
here
i
want
you
to
escort
her
to
madama
tilia
house
this
afternoon
sophia
stifled
a
gasp
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
struck
from
behind
she
wanted
to
cry
out
in
protest
but
she
knew
it
was
useless
must
i
said
lorenzo
and
sophia
saw
pain
in
his
eyes
remember
your
promise
to
me
in
rome
david
said
fixing
him
with
a
grim
stare
lorenzo
sighed
i
remember
sophia
heart
already
bruised
by
her
gloomy
thoughts
about
herself
ached
even
harder
for
rachel
she
had
tried
to
save
her
from
being
sent
to
tilia
but
there
was
no
more
she
could
do
if
ugolini
was
right
about
their
being
in
such
terrible
danger
rachel
might
be
safer
at
tilia
than
here
how
could
she
help
rachel
she
thought
desolately
when
she
herself
was
a
stranger
among
strangers
xvii
the
beauty
of
orvieto
simon
thought
was
that
isolated
as
it
was
on
its
great
rock
it
was
as
big
as
it
ever
could
be
and
a
man
could
go
anywhere
in
the
city
quickly
on
foot
those
of
wealth
and
rank
often
rode
but
a
horse
or
a
sedan
chair
was
a
mark
of
distinction
rather
than
a
necessity
a
bird
looking
down
on
the
city
would
see
a
roughly
oval
shape
longer
from
east
to
west
one
might
get
lost
in
the
twisting
side
streets
but
otherwise
could
walk
along
the
corso
from
one
end
of
orvieto
to
the
other
while
less
than
half
the
sand
trickled
through
an
hour
glass
from
ugolini
mansion
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
simon
reached
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
near
the
northern
wall
so
quickly
he
barely
had
time
to
think
over
the
events
of
the
day
david
of
trebizond
was
a
trader
after
all
and
traders
needed
armed
men
to
protect
their
caravans
why
worry
about
the
three
men
with
swords
and
crossbows
he
had
seen
with
giancarlo
they
were
far
from
being
an
army
but
was
david
actually
sending
out
any
caravans
i
could
put
someone
in
the
enemy
camp
before
entering
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
he
surveyed
it
with
a
eye
it
was
a
brown
stone
building
with
a
flat
roof
crowned
by
square
battlements
in
each
of
the
four
corners
of
the
palace
there
were
small
turrets
with
slotted
windows
for
archers
above
the
third
story
rose
a
central
tower
even
as
he
looked
up
he
noticed
a
figure
on
the
battlements
a
helmeted
man
with
a
crossbow
on
his
shoulder
he
looked
down
at
simon
touched
his
hand
to
his
helmet
and
walked
on
it
was
good
to
know
that
the
monaldeschi
family
maintained
a
constant
guard
on
their
palace
the
hidden
enemy
of
the
tartars
could
get
at
them
here
only
by
a
siege
simon
walked
around
the
building
if
there
were
two
archers
in
each
turret
their
overlapping
fields
of
fire
would
cover
every
possible
approach
he
noted
that
the
piazza
in
front
of
the
palace
and
the
broad
streets
on
the
other
three
sides
allowed
attackers
no
cover
the
city
wall
was
nearby
though
he
saw
archers
could
fire
on
the
monaldeschi
roof
from
there
and
at
least
two
of
the
city
defensive
towers
were
so
close
that
stone
casters
set
up
in
them
could
score
hits
on
the
palace
what
if
the
enemy
were
to
attempt
a
siege
must
control
that
section
of
the
city
wall
and
make
it
our
first
line
of
defense
the
buildings
around
the
palace
would
be
our
second
and
the
palace
itself
the
third
to
control
all
that
we
really
need
another
forty
crossbowmen
but
how
to
pay
and
feed
them
and
keep
them
under
discipline
i
will
have
to
make
do
with
my
knights
the
venetians
the
armenians
and
the
monaldeschi
and
he
felt
the
weight
of
responsibility
pressing
on
his
back
like
a
boulder
he
had
studied
siege
warfare
under
veterans
but
how
good
he
asked
himself
would
he
be
in
real
combat
his
entire
experience
of
battle
consisted
of
one
siege
that
ended
as
soon
as
the
rebellious
vassal
saw
the
size
of
simon
army
one
encounter
in
his
private
forest
with
poachers
who
ran
away
when
he
drew
his
sword
and
one
tournament
two
years
ago
in
toulouse
and
yet
if
the
monaldeschi
palace
were
attacked
he
would
be
expected
to
assume
command
the
thought
made
his
stomach
knot
with
anxiety
he
scrutinized
the
palace
itself
he
saw
no
windows
at
all
on
the
ground
floor
but
there
were
slots
for
archers
the
second
story
had
narrow
windows
covered
with
heavy
iron
bars
on
the
highest
level
the
windows
were
wider
and
the
grills
that
protected
them
of
a
more
delicate
construction
on
that
floor
were
the
apartments
of
the
monaldeschi
and
their
more
distinguished
guests
the
darkness
and
cramped
quarters
one
had
to
endure
in
the
palace
because
it
was
so
were
a
measure
of
the
fierceness
of
the
street
fighting
that
had
been
going
on
in
orvieto
as
in
most
of
the
cities
of
northern
and
central
italy
for
generations
french
are
better
off
doing
most
of
our
fighting
in
the
countryside
city
fighting
is
a
dirty
there
were
only
two
ways
into
the
palace
on
the
west
side
a
postern
gate
for
horses
and
carts
was
protected
by
a
gatehouse
with
two
portcullises
and
doors
reinforced
with
iron
in
front
facing
the
piazza
a
gatehouse
with
a
peaked
roof
and
arrow
slots
jutted
out
from
the
center
of
the
building
the
doorway
was
in
the
side
of
the
gatehouse
on
the
second
floor
and
to
reach
it
one
climbed
a
flight
of
narrow
stairs
plan
for
a
siege
that
probably
will
never
take
place
simon
asked
himself
i
have
tried
to
go
beyond
my
duty
this
day
and
accomplished
nothing
i
had
better
be
sure
i
can
do
what
i
am
expected
to
the
door
swung
open
as
simon
reached
the
top
step
oh
you
look
too
serious
ragazzo
caro
do
frown
so
it
will
put
wrinkles
in
your
smooth
brow
surely
your
life
is
not
so
melancholy
as
all
that
fingernails
stroked
his
forehead
and
then
his
cheek
simon
recognized
the
voice
but
after
the
bright
sunlight
of
the
street
it
took
his
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust
to
the
darkness
inside
the
doorway
and
actually
to
see
donna
elvira
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
through
the
inner
door
which
in
the
practice
of
fortified
buildings
was
set
at
right
angles
to
the
outer
one
the
hallway
that
ran
the
length
of
the
second
floor
was
dimly
illuminated
through
the
barred
windows
unlit
brass
oil
lamps
hung
at
intervals
from
the
ceiling
i
saw
you
from
my
window
and
came
down
to
let
you
in
myself
the
contessa
nose
was
sharp
and
hooked
like
a
falcon
beak
it
might
have
been
handsome
on
a
man
but
it
gave
her
an
unpleasantly
predatory
look
simon
felt
distaste
at
the
short
silky
hairs
on
her
upper
lip
and
uneasiness
at
the
bright
black
eyes
that
looked
at
him
so
greedily
she
gave
off
a
strong
smell
of
wine
how
old
was
she
he
wondered
at
least
eighty
he
politely
bowed
over
her
bony
knuckles
and
kissed
them
quickly
she
held
his
hand
longer
than
necessary
your
greeting
does
me
too
much
honor
donna
elvira
simon
said
easing
his
hand
away
from
hers
i
was
frowning
because
i
was
thinking
of
what
we
must
do
to
protect
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
i
am
happy
to
see
that
you
have
a
guard
posted
on
the
roof
always
the
contessa
held
up
a
clenched
bejeweled
fist
but
surely
you
are
not
afraid
for
the
emissaries
who
would
want
to
hurt
those
little
brown
men
no
i
am
ever
on
guard
against
my
family
ancient
enemies
the
filippeschi
simon
felt
the
boulder
on
his
back
grow
a
little
heavier
else
to
worry
is
it
possible
that
the
filippeschi
family
might
attack
us
here
the
contessa
nodded
grimly
they
have
wanted
blood
ever
since
my
retainers
killed
the
three
filippeschi
brothers
the
father
and
the
uncles
of
marco
di
filippeschi
who
is
now
their
capo
della
famiglia
they
caught
them
on
the
road
to
rome
and
cut
off
the
heads
of
all
three
to
my
eternal
joy
six
years
ago
that
was
my
god
why
did
your
retainers
do
that
there
was
more
than
a
little
madness
simon
thought
in
the
toothless
grin
the
contessa
gave
him
ah
that
was
to
pay
them
back
for
the
death
of
my
husband
conte
ezzelino
twenty
years
ago
and
my
son
gaitano
who
died
fighting
beside
him
and
my
nephew
ermanno
whom
they
shot
with
an
arrow
from
ambush
twelve
years
ago
she
held
up
bony
fingers
totaling
up
the
terrible
score
they
cut
out
my
tongue
and
his
heart
horrible
simon
exclaimed
now
there
remain
only
myself
and
my
grandnephew
vittorio
a
ragazzo
of
twelve
to
lead
the
monaldeschi
what
of
vittorio
mother
simon
asked
the
contessa
shrugged
she
went
mad
she
thought
simon
the
contessa
face
turned
scarlet
as
she
recounted
her
injuries
now
that
canaglia
marco
would
surely
love
to
finish
us
by
killing
vittorio
and
me
but
he
is
not
man
enough
and
one
day
i
will
cut
out
tongue
and
heart
might
the
filippeschi
attack
john
and
philip
thinking
it
would
hurt
you
simon
asked
the
contessa
thought
for
a
moment
and
nodded
ah
that
is
very
clever
of
you
certainly
they
would
treat
any
guest
of
mine
as
an
enemy
of
theirs
she
smiled
at
any
rate
you
need
not
worry
about
protecting
the
tartars
today
they
are
not
here
simon
felt
as
if
a
trapdoor
had
opened
under
his
feet
where
are
they
the
contessa
shrugged
riding
out
in
the
hills
they
left
hours
ago
they
took
their
own
guards
and
the
old
franciscan
with
them
he
told
me
they
were
restless
wounds
simon
remembered
the
bloody
fight
between
the
venetians
and
the
armenians
he
remembered
giancarlo
and
his
bravos
he
thought
about
what
the
contessa
had
just
said
about
the
enmity
of
the
filippeschi
he
pictured
the
mutilated
bodies
of
the
tartars
sprawled
on
a
mountain
road
did
my
french
knights
go
with
them
the
contessa
shrugged
they
are
in
the
palazzo
courtyard
practicing
with
wooden
swords
simon
ground
his
teeth
in
rage
idiots
training
themselves
for
some
future
battle
while
their
charges
go
off
to
face
god
knows
what
dangers
which
road
did
the
tartars
take
i
must
go
after
them
the
contessa
was
by
now
rather
obviously
annoyed
at
his
lack
of
interest
in
her
i
do
not
know
perhaps
cardinal
paulus
knows
he
spoke
to
them
before
they
left
simon
bade
the
contessa
a
polite
she
insisted
on
embracing
him
he
wondered
if
he
had
looked
as
foolish
to
sophia
as
donna
elvira
now
appeared
to
him
for
the
second
time
that
day
simon
found
himself
sitting
in
a
chair
that
was
too
small
for
him
the
back
of
this
one
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
halfway
up
his
spine
and
his
shoulders
ached
even
though
he
had
been
sitting
for
only
a
few
moments
he
had
taken
off
his
gloves
and
tucked
them
in
his
sword
belt
and
he
sat
with
his
fists
clenched
in
his
lap
de
verceuil
strode
across
the
room
and
stood
over
simon
i
may
yet
demand
that
you
be
sent
home
i
can
not
imagine
why
the
count
of
anjou
entrusted
such
a
stripling
with
a
mission
of
this
importance
your
eminence
may
not
approve
of
my
visiting
cardinal
ugolini
simon
said
keeping
his
voice
firm
but
can
you
show
me
where
i
have
done
wrong
he
did
not
want
to
talk
about
ugolini
he
wanted
to
find
out
where
the
tartars
were
but
de
verceuil
had
not
even
given
him
time
to
ask
you
could
have
gone
wrong
in
a
thousand
ways
said
de
verceuil
staring
down
at
simon
both
the
king
and
count
charles
have
confided
in
you
rashly
i
believe
you
might
have
revealed
more
about
their
intentions
than
you
should
have
simon
remembered
how
ugolini
had
reacted
at
once
to
the
idea
that
the
purpose
of
the
alliance
was
to
conquer
islam
completely
saying
that
might
indeed
have
been
a
blunder
he
felt
his
face
grow
hot
discomfort
and
anger
pushed
simon
to
his
feet
de
verceuil
had
to
take
a
step
backward
why
have
you
allowed
the
ambassadors
to
go
riding
in
the
hills
with
only
six
men
to
escort
them
simon
demanded
that
is
negligence
your
eminence
a
good
deal
more
dangerous
than
my
visit
to
cardinal
ugolini
where
have
they
gone
de
verceuil
whirled
the
heavy
gold
cross
on
his
chest
swinging
and
paced
to
the
mullioned
window
then
turned
to
face
simon
again
his
face
a
deep
crimson
seemed
to
glow
in
the
light
that
came
in
through
the
translucent
glass
guarding
the
ambassadors
is
your
responsibility
count
he
spoke
in
a
low
relentless
tone
i
did
not
bother
to
inquire
where
they
were
going
if
you
think
they
should
not
have
gone
out
into
the
countryside
you
should
have
been
here
to
stop
them
his
voice
rose
to
a
shout
not
waiting
upon
cardinal
ugolini
simon
face
grew
hot
with
shame
de
verceuil
had
him
even
if
he
had
not
done
anything
wrong
by
visiting
ugolini
he
should
have
first
made
sure
the
ambassadors
would
be
safe
while
he
was
gone
he
could
have
left
explicit
orders
with
henri
de
puys
or
with
alain
de
pirenne
i
will
go
after
them
now
simon
started
for
the
door
i
have
not
dismissed
you
rage
boiled
up
within
simon
i
am
the
count
de
gobignon
only
the
king
can
command
me
de
verceuil
crossed
the
room
to
thrust
his
face
into
simon
once
again
god
can
command
you
young
man
and
the
of
verceuil
is
god
spokesman
have
a
care
or
i
doubt
not
god
will
show
you
how
fleeting
is
worldly
rank
he
trying
to
use
god
to
threaten
me
simon
thought
dumbfounded
if
you
overstep
your
bounds
again
de
verceuil
went
on
i
promise
you
my
messenger
will
fly
to
the
count
demanding
that
you
be
removed
from
this
post
if
the
count
must
choose
between
you
and
me
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
choose
the
more
experienced
head
and
the
one
more
influential
with
the
pope
do
that
said
simon
his
voice
trembling
with
fury
and
i
will
make
my
own
report
to
the
count
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
de
verceuil
shout
of
what
do
you
mean
by
that
was
cut
off
by
the
slam
of
the
heavy
oak
door
it
seemed
to
simon
as
if
the
air
were
filled
with
motes
of
gold
he
his
equerry
thierry
and
de
pirenne
and
de
puys
were
riding
high
on
the
western
slope
of
a
mountain
thickly
clad
with
pines
shadow
drowned
the
valley
below
the
horizon
to
the
west
was
an
undulating
black
silhouette
from
beyond
that
range
the
platinum
glow
of
the
setting
sun
dazzled
his
eyes
look
ahead
monseigneur
said
alain
gripping
simon
shoulder
and
pointing
toward
a
dark
green
hill
with
a
rounded
top
to
the
north
simon
stomach
tightened
as
he
saw
a
party
of
riders
strung
out
along
the
road
they
rode
in
sunlight
and
he
recognized
the
tunics
of
the
armenians
he
thought
sighing
and
smiling
the
tartars
party
had
ridden
far
he
had
followed
their
trail
most
of
the
afternoon
and
found
them
only
now
because
they
were
coming
back
he
squinted
trying
to
see
the
tartars
he
clucked
to
his
palfrey
and
spurred
her
lightly
from
a
walk
to
a
trot
his
three
companions
did
the
same
two
carts
with
high
sides
lurched
down
the
road
behind
the
armenians
a
single
mule
pulled
the
cart
in
front
two
drew
the
second
a
man
in
a
red
tunic
drove
each
cart
where
the
devil
were
the
tartars
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
party
on
the
back
of
a
donkey
he
saw
a
figure
in
brown
friar
mathieu
simon
began
to
feel
panic
again
do
you
see
the
tartars
he
asked
his
men
de
puys
snorted
they
are
probably
too
lazy
to
ride
they
are
sitting
in
one
of
those
carts
fancying
themselves
lords
of
the
earth
tartars
think
it
unmanly
to
be
carried
when
they
can
ride
simon
told
de
puys
annoyed
at
the
old
knight
ignorance
but
i
see
horses
without
riders
alain
de
pirenne
said
four
of
them
simon
squinted
again
and
saw
that
each
of
four
armenians
on
horseback
was
leading
a
riderless
horse
even
though
it
was
a
warm
evening
he
felt
as
if
a
sudden
blast
of
cold
wind
were
blowing
right
through
him
he
sat
frozen
in
the
saddle
god
are
we
too
late
follow
me
he
snapped
kicking
his
palfrey
hard
riding
as
quickly
as
they
dared
down
the
rocky
unfamiliar
road
they
heard
church
bells
chiming
out
the
angelus
the
shadow
cast
by
the
hills
to
the
west
rose
to
engulf
them
as
they
descended
the
armenians
had
gathered
on
the
other
side
of
a
meandering
river
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
valley
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
decide
where
to
cross
simon
still
saw
no
sign
of
the
tartars
but
it
was
too
dark
to
make
anyone
out
clearly
in
his
dread
he
rode
his
horse
straight
into
the
river
she
stumbled
on
the
rocky
bed
a
time
or
two
and
once
plunged
into
a
deep
place
where
she
had
to
swim
it
being
the
end
of
august
all
the
streams
hereabout
were
at
their
lowest
level
even
so
when
simon
got
across
he
was
soaked
up
to
his
waist
he
saw
the
armenians
unslinging
their
bows
and
nocking
arrows
it
is
i
de
gobignon
he
shouted
he
heard
friar
mathieu
call
something
to
the
men
and
they
lowered
their
bows
good
that
they
were
alert
he
thought
but
what
might
have
happened
to
them
on
the
road
to
make
them
so
he
rode
in
among
the
armenians
and
felt
a
hollow
pit
in
his
stomach
as
he
saw
the
rich
saddles
on
two
of
the
riderless
horses
silver
and
inlays
glistening
even
in
the
darkness
of
the
forest
simon
friar
mathieu
on
donkeyback
called
simon
turned
to
the
nearest
cart
and
looked
in
over
the
shoulder
of
the
driver
one
of
the
armenians
who
stared
at
him
from
under
heavy
brows
there
on
a
bed
of
straw
lay
two
bodies
they
had
the
short
broad
build
of
the
tartar
ambassadors
simon
heart
stopped
beating
mary
mother
of
god
simon
whispered
he
got
down
from
his
horse
mathieu
was
beside
him
gripping
his
arm
did
you
come
looking
for
us
simon
simon
was
sick
with
despair
he
gestured
feebly
at
the
two
bodies
what
happened
to
them
you
might
call
it
a
mischance
due
to
their
inexperience
i
tried
to
warn
them
but
they
would
not
heed
me
mischance
what
sort
of
mischance
did
it
matter
simon
wondered
how
this
had
happened
he
had
failed
utterly
and
absolutely
that
was
all
that
counted
his
foolish
decision
to
go
to
ugolini
had
led
to
this
disaster
another
stain
on
the
house
of
gobignon
he
put
his
hands
to
his
face
if
only
i
had
stayed
with
them
this
morning
mathieu
patted
his
arm
do
not
reproach
yourself
no
one
will
blame
you
it
would
probably
have
happened
just
the
same
even
if
you
were
there
simon
felt
the
old
friar
words
like
a
blow
in
the
face
what
shame
to
be
thought
so
useless
that
even
his
presence
would
not
have
saved
the
tartars
but
he
told
himself
turning
the
knife
in
his
own
guts
it
was
true
anyone
stupid
enough
to
let
something
like
this
happen
surely
be
useless
in
a
moment
of
danger
did
you
not
know
how
dangerous
these
hills
could
be
he
asked
they
were
determined
on
a
long
ride
said
friar
mathieu
tartars
are
used
to
vast
distances
and
great
spaces
you
can
not
imagine
how
miserable
they
were
feeling
cooped
up
in
a
hill
town
surrounded
by
a
wall
on
top
of
a
rock
i
felt
sorry
for
them
in
fact
i
even
feared
for
their
health
simon
was
indignant
feared
for
their
health
the
devil
you
say
now
look
at
them
friar
mathieu
squeezed
simon
arm
do
not
mention
the
devil
he
may
come
when
you
call
as
for
them
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
two
inert
forms
in
the
cart
this
is
embarrassing
to
be
sure
but
we
need
not
blame
ourselves
embarrassing
embarrassing
is
that
all
you
call
it
one
of
the
bodies
on
the
straw
moved
as
simon
stared
it
lurched
to
its
knees
he
heard
a
few
slurred
words
in
the
guttural
speech
of
the
tartars
the
figure
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
side
of
the
cart
lifted
its
head
and
vomited
loudly
and
copiously
they
are
not
dead
simon
cried
dead
drunk
said
friar
mathieu
relief
was
so
sudden
and
stunning
that
for
a
moment
simon
could
not
breathe
he
caught
his
breath
and
gasped
the
gasp
was
followed
by
a
roar
of
laughter
simon
stood
his
head
thrown
back
helpless
with
laughter
he
pressed
his
hands
against
his
aching
stomach
friar
mathieu
had
gone
to
attend
the
sick
tartar
he
wiped
the
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
went
to
the
stream
and
washed
the
sleeve
then
came
back
and
pressed
the
wet
wool
to
the
tartar
brow
can
you
not
stop
laughing
he
said
on
his
second
trip
to
the
stream
the
armenians
do
not
like
you
laughing
at
their
masters
dead
drunk
simon
shouted
and
went
into
another
spasm
of
laughter
it
started
innocently
enough
friar
mathieu
explained
as
they
rode
back
together
he
himself
had
proposed
to
take
the
road
to
montefiascone
along
which
he
had
heard
there
was
a
particularly
impressive
view
of
orvieto
simon
remembered
the
spot
he
had
been
enjoying
that
same
view
when
david
of
trebizond
servant
what
was
his
name
giancarlo
came
along
with
those
three
heavily
armed
men
the
tartars
had
been
pleased
enough
with
the
view
but
they
wanted
to
ride
on
friar
mathieu
felt
some
trepidation
that
they
might
encounter
highwaymen
in
the
hills
but
he
had
confidence
in
the
armenians
too
and
so
they
pressed
on
along
the
mountain
road
they
observed
everything
and
talked
to
each
other
in
such
low
voices
i
could
not
hear
them
mathieu
turned
to
give
simon
a
pained
look
i
think
they
were
discussing
how
an
army
might
be
brought
through
these
hills
simon
was
appalled
he
pictured
a
tartar
army
tens
of
thousands
of
savages
on
horseback
sweeping
through
umbria
on
its
way
to
rome
burning
the
towns
and
the
farms
and
slaughtering
the
people
simon
shook
his
head
in
perplexity
if
such
a
thing
happened
he
would
have
helped
to
bring
it
about
by
the
time
the
tartars
and
their
entourage
reached
the
little
town
of
montefiascone
mathieu
went
on
in
the
heart
of
hills
they
were
all
hungry
and
thirsty
they
took
over
the
inn
the
black
looks
cast
by
the
armenians
were
enough
to
drive
out
the
other
patrons
and
proceeded
to
drink
up
the
host
considerable
supply
of
wine
the
wine
of
montefiascone
is
a
great
gift
from
god
mathieu
said
very
clear
almost
as
light
as
spring
water
just
a
touch
sweet
just
a
touch
tart
and
the
host
brought
it
up
from
a
stone
cellar
that
kept
it
deliciously
cold
not
strong
wine
actually
but
the
tartars
drank
there
friar
mathieu
pointed
to
the
young
armenian
leader
prince
hethum
who
was
now
riding
beside
alain
de
pirenne
at
the
head
of
their
procession
back
to
orvieto
the
prince
was
carrying
the
tartars
purse
now
somewhat
less
fat
with
gold
florins
the
host
at
the
inn
had
been
delighted
to
serve
his
thirsty
guests
but
when
his
supply
of
wine
was
gone
the
tartars
turned
ugly
philip
uzbek
the
younger
tartar
grabbed
the
host
by
the
throat
the
armenians
who
were
careful
to
drink
sparingly
fingered
their
bows
the
innkeeper
left
his
wife
as
a
hostage
and
went
out
to
the
nearby
farms
and
after
a
tense
hour
arrived
back
with
a
cartload
of
wine
barrels
this
time
the
wine
outlasted
the
tartars
they
have
no
head
for
wine
you
see
mathieu
said
poor
innocent
world
conquerors
they
drink
a
beverage
called
kumiss
which
is
fermented
mare
milk
very
mild
but
it
satisfies
their
desire
to
get
drunk
when
they
conquered
the
civilized
lands
for
the
first
time
they
could
have
as
much
wine
as
they
wanted
they
have
an
ungodly
appetite
for
it
when
the
tartar
ambassadors
collapsed
unconscious
mathieu
and
the
host
had
both
sighed
with
relief
with
the
tartars
gold
mathieu
bought
two
carts
and
three
mules
and
they
loaded
john
chagan
and
philip
uzbek
in
one
and
the
remaining
barrels
of
montefiascone
wine
in
the
other
montefiascone
may
be
the
only
town
in
the
world
that
can
say
it
has
been
invaded
by
tartars
and
profited
said
mathieu
simon
laughed
he
had
thought
to
bring
flint
tinder
a
lantern
and
a
supply
of
candles
with
him
and
now
thierry
rode
at
the
head
of
the
party
with
the
lantern
raised
on
the
end
of
a
long
tree
branch
giving
them
a
little
light
to
follow
at
least
this
way
the
tartars
would
not
go
over
a
cliff
in
their
cart
in
the
dark
if
i
could
have
found
you
this
morning
i
would
have
asked
you
to
come
along
and
bring
some
of
your
frenchmen
the
old
friar
said
but
you
were
meeting
with
cardinal
ugolini
were
you
not
when
mathieu
mentioned
ugolini
simon
immediately
found
himself
thinking
of
the
cardinal
beautiful
niece
he
wondered
was
she
older
than
he
how
would
she
react
if
he
tried
to
see
her
again
he
wished
he
could
forget
tartars
and
crusaders
and
saracens
and
devote
himself
to
paying
court
to
sophia
of
course
if
he
went
anywhere
near
establishment
again
de
verceuil
would
undoubtedly
think
he
was
trying
to
continue
the
forbidden
negotiations
my
efforts
went
badly
he
told
friar
mathieu
before
going
on
he
peered
as
far
along
the
road
ahead
as
he
could
see
de
pirenne
and
de
puys
were
both
riding
at
the
head
of
the
party
just
behind
thierry
with
his
lantern
hethum
and
the
other
armenians
came
next
and
they
understood
no
french
simon
and
friar
mathieu
were
at
the
end
of
the
line
behind
the
two
carts
there
was
no
risk
in
talking
cardinal
ugolini
nearly
convinced
me
that
our
efforts
to
liberate
the
holy
land
are
futile
and
then
de
verceuil
knew
that
i
had
gone
to
ugolini
and
he
was
furious
how
did
he
know
where
i
had
been
friar
mathieu
smiled
he
had
you
followed
that
snake
the
franciscan
reached
over
and
laid
his
fragile
hand
lightly
on
simon
hush
simon
the
cardinal
will
answer
to
god
one
day
for
his
worldly
ways
simon
shook
his
head
i
tell
you
friar
mathieu
between
persuasion
and
de
verceuil
bullying
i
was
nearly
ready
to
leave
orvieto
today
but
he
would
not
have
left
under
any
circumstances
he
knew
especially
not
after
meeting
sophia
he
recalled
her
smoldering
eyes
and
full
red
lips
and
her
splendid
breasts
ah
no
he
must
stay
in
orvieto
and
become
better
acquainted
with
sophia
orfali
xviii
a
swollen
yellow
moon
appeared
over
the
treetops
and
simon
was
grateful
for
its
light
now
they
would
have
less
trouble
following
the
road
friar
mathieu
said
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
for
so
young
a
man
to
match
wits
with
two
powerful
churchmen
skilled
in
dialectic
i
congratulate
you
on
doing
it
at
all
simon
felt
a
hollow
in
his
stomach
he
saw
himself
going
back
to
france
sneered
at
not
only
for
his
family
disgrace
but
for
his
own
incompetence
our
mission
succeed
he
said
clenching
his
fist
his
voice
rose
above
the
creak
of
the
wagon
wheels
surprising
even
himself
with
his
vehemence
god
has
his
own
ideas
about
what
ought
to
succeed
or
fail
said
friar
mathieu
do
not
try
to
take
the
whole
burden
on
yourself
i
must
said
simon
feeling
tears
burn
his
eyes
the
voice
in
the
semidarkness
beside
him
was
soft
kindly
why
because
of
who
i
am
simon
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
mean
simon
i
tell
simon
wondered
ever
since
seven
years
ago
his
mother
and
roland
had
told
him
the
secret
of
his
birth
questions
of
who
he
really
was
questions
of
right
and
wrong
had
assailed
him
and
there
had
been
no
one
to
ask
he
loved
his
mother
and
he
admired
roland
but
they
were
too
close
to
it
all
but
to
tell
anyone
else
would
bring
calamity
down
on
all
three
of
them
there
had
been
times
during
the
years
simon
had
lived
with
king
louis
that
the
king
had
seemed
ready
to
listen
but
simon
had
also
known
that
king
louis
believed
in
doing
right
no
matter
whom
it
hurt
friar
mathieu
though
seemed
to
have
more
of
a
sense
that
life
was
not
a
matter
of
simple
rights
and
wrongs
he
could
see
the
tartars
for
the
ferocious
creatures
they
were
and
yet
feel
kindly
toward
them
his
wisdom
and
worldly
experience
could
help
simon
sort
things
out
then
too
there
was
a
way
to
bind
friar
mathieu
never
to
speak
of
this
to
anyone
but
when
simon
tried
to
speak
his
chest
and
throat
were
constricted
by
fear
and
his
voice
came
out
in
a
croak
he
felt
as
if
he
were
under
a
spell
to
prevent
him
from
uttering
his
family
secrets
father
may
i
confide
in
you
under
the
seal
of
confession
the
old
franciscan
tugged
on
the
reins
of
his
donkey
so
that
they
fell
farther
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
simon
slowed
his
palfrey
to
fall
back
beside
mathieu
is
it
truly
a
matter
for
confession
or
just
a
secret
simon
hands
were
so
cold
he
pressed
them
against
his
palfrey
neck
to
warm
them
how
could
he
tell
everything
to
this
priest
he
had
known
only
a
few
months
perhaps
he
should
just
apologize
and
say
no
more
but
he
thought
a
little
longer
and
said
it
is
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
and
if
i
am
doing
wrong
i
am
committing
a
terribly
grave
sin
friar
mathieu
looked
around
him
very
well
then
what
you
tell
me
is
under
the
seal
of
the
sacrament
of
confession
and
i
may
repeat
it
to
no
man
under
penalty
of
eternal
damnation
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
begin
simon
touched
his
fingertips
to
forehead
chest
and
shoulders
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
his
mouth
dry
and
his
heart
hammering
he
had
promised
his
mother
and
roland
never
to
tell
anyone
about
this
i
must
i
can
not
have
it
festering
inside
me
for
the
rest
of
my
what
though
if
friar
mathieu
disappointed
him
what
if
he
had
nothing
useful
or
even
comforting
to
say
on
learning
simon
secret
well
there
was
a
way
to
test
him
the
secret
was
really
twofold
one
part
of
it
was
terrible
enough
but
already
known
to
the
king
and
queen
and
many
knights
who
had
been
on
the
last
crusade
simon
could
tell
friar
mathieu
the
lesser
secret
safely
enough
then
weigh
his
response
and
decide
whether
to
tell
him
what
was
known
to
only
three
people
in
the
world
i
said
i
must
make
this
mission
succeed
because
of
who
i
am
what
have
you
heard
about
the
last
count
de
gobignon
by
now
the
moon
had
risen
high
and
simon
could
see
the
old
face
quite
clearly
friar
mathieu
frowned
and
stroked
his
long
white
beard
very
little
i
am
afraid
he
was
a
very
great
landowner
one
of
the
five
peers
of
the
realm
as
you
are
now
and
he
was
zealous
in
putting
down
the
cathar
heretics
in
languedoc
he
cast
a
pained
look
at
simon
i
spent
the
years
when
your
father
was
prominent
wandering
the
roads
as
a
beggar
then
studying
for
the
priesthood
and
i
am
afraid
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
what
was
happening
in
the
world
friar
mathieu
reply
brought
a
sad
smile
to
simon
lips
that
you
like
most
people
know
so
little
of
amalric
de
gobignon
i
owe
to
the
generosity
of
king
louis
and
those
close
to
him
the
man
whose
name
i
inherited
was
a
murderer
an
archtraitor
a
judas
but
when
king
louis
came
back
from
that
failed
crusade
in
egypt
he
decreed
that
count
amalric
deeds
not
be
made
known
i
well
remember
my
horror
when
i
heard
that
the
king
was
captured
and
his
army
destroyed
said
friar
mathieu
i
fell
on
my
knees
in
the
road
weeping
and
prayed
for
him
and
the
queen
and
the
other
captives
what
joy
when
we
learned
they
were
ransomed
and
would
be
coming
back
to
us
it
was
count
amalric
treachery
that
caused
the
calamity
it
seemed
to
simon
that
nicolette
his
mother
and
her
husband
roland
had
told
him
the
story
hundreds
of
times
they
wanted
him
to
know
it
by
heart
he
believed
that
the
cathars
had
murdered
his
father
count
stephen
de
gobignon
my
grandfather
simon
went
on
king
louis
advocated
mercy
toward
heretics
count
amalric
had
a
brother
hugues
a
dominican
inquisitor
who
was
killed
before
his
very
eyes
by
an
assassin
arrow
in
béziers
while
he
was
presiding
over
the
burning
of
cathars
ah
those
dominicans
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
when
hugues
was
killed
count
amalric
blamed
the
king
leniency
toward
heretics
after
that
it
seems
a
madness
possessed
the
count
he
came
to
believe
he
could
overthrow
the
king
and
take
his
throne
he
must
have
been
mad
said
friar
mathieu
never
has
a
king
of
france
been
so
loved
as
this
louis
count
amalric
went
on
crusade
with
king
louis
taking
my
mother
countess
nicolette
along
with
him
even
as
king
louis
took
queen
marguerite
i
was
a
very
young
child
then
they
left
me
in
the
keeping
of
my
mother
sisters
the
crusaders
captured
damietta
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
left
the
noncombatants
there
and
marched
southward
toward
cairo
simon
hesitated
feeling
himself
choke
up
again
these
were
the
crimes
of
the
man
everyone
believed
was
his
father
it
was
agony
to
give
voice
to
them
but
he
plunged
on
at
a
city
called
mansura
count
amalric
led
part
of
his
own
army
into
a
trap
and
most
were
killed
he
tricked
the
rest
of
the
army
including
the
king
into
surrendering
to
the
mamelukes
he
alone
escaped
he
went
to
damietta
supposedly
to
take
charge
of
the
defense
he
made
a
secret
promise
to
the
sultan
of
cairo
to
deliver
damietta
together
with
the
ransom
money
if
the
sultan
would
slay
the
king
and
all
the
other
captive
crusaders
friar
mathieu
gasped
why
in
god
name
would
a
french
nobleman
do
such
dreadful
things
with
the
king
and
his
brothers
dead
he
would
be
the
most
powerful
man
in
france
said
simon
he
might
have
succeeded
but
for
two
things
first
the
mameluke
emirs
led
by
the
same
baibars
who
now
rules
egypt
rose
in
revolt
and
killed
the
sultan
with
whom
count
amalric
was
bargaining
baibars
and
the
mamelukes
preferred
to
deal
honorably
with
their
prisoners
ah
yes
baibars
friar
mathieu
nodded
the
tartars
hate
him
and
all
of
outremer
fears
him
and
then
a
captured
along
with
the
king
one
who
had
an
old
grudge
against
the
count
de
gobignon
offered
to
go
to
damietta
and
meet
the
count
in
single
combat
after
a
fierce
combat
he
slew
count
amalric
the
king
and
the
surviving
crusaders
were
saved
and
they
ransomed
themselves
the
troubadour
name
was
roland
de
vency
i
never
heard
of
him
said
friar
mathieu
no
just
as
you
never
heard
of
count
amalric
treason
the
king
wanted
the
whole
episode
buried
in
an
unmarked
grave
along
with
the
count
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
moment
simon
listened
to
the
cart
wheels
creak
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
painting
the
umbrian
hillsides
silver
soon
they
would
round
a
bend
and
see
the
lights
of
orvieto
simon
torn
by
anguish
wondered
what
friar
mathieu
thought
of
him
did
he
despise
him
as
so
many
great
nobles
did
he
remembered
that
friar
mathieu
had
once
been
a
knight
himself
how
could
he
not
hate
a
man
with
amalric
de
gobignon
blood
in
him
his
muscles
knotted
as
he
waited
to
hear
what
friar
mathieu
would
say
he
looked
at
the
old
franciscan
and
saw
sadness
in
his
watery
eyes
but
what
happened
does
not
lie
buried
much
as
the
king
and
you
would
wish
it
to
simon
felt
tears
sting
his
eyes
and
a
lump
grow
in
his
throat
he
remembered
the
sneers
the
slights
the
whispers
he
had
endured
such
heartbreaking
moments
were
among
his
earliest
memories
he
shook
his
head
miserably
no
what
happened
has
never
been
forgotten
you
are
ashamed
of
the
name
you
bear
the
kindness
in
friar
voice
evoked
a
warm
feeling
in
simon
breast
was
not
mistaken
in
you
are
how
old
twenty
simon
nodded
at
your
age
most
men
especially
those
like
you
with
vast
estates
and
great
responsibilities
are
married
or
at
least
plighted
pain
poured
out
with
simon
words
i
have
been
rebuffed
twice
the
name
of
de
gobignon
is
irrevocably
tainted
friar
mathieu
rubbed
the
back
of
his
donkey
neck
thoughtfully
evidently
the
king
does
not
think
so
or
he
would
not
have
honored
you
with
so
important
a
task
he
did
everything
possible
to
help
me
when
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
fought
over
who
should
have
the
rearing
of
me
the
king
settled
it
by
making
himself
my
guardian
and
taking
me
to
live
in
the
palace
then
his
brother
count
charles
took
me
for
a
time
as
his
equerry
why
did
your
mother
and
grandmother
fight
over
you
the
hollow
of
dread
in
simon
middle
grew
huge
now
they
were
coming
to
the
deepest
secret
of
all
my
mother
married
the
troubadour
roland
de
vency
my
grandmother
count
amalric
mother
could
never
accept
as
a
father
to
me
the
man
who
slew
her
son
he
felt
dizzy
with
pain
remembering
his
grandmother
screams
of
rage
his
mother
weeping
roland
facing
the
sword
points
of
a
dozen
long
mysterious
journeys
hours
of
doing
nothing
in
empty
rooms
while
somewhere
nearby
people
argued
over
his
fate
god
it
had
been
horrible
friar
mathieu
reached
out
from
the
back
of
his
donkey
and
laid
a
comforting
hand
on
simon
arm
ah
i
understand
you
better
now
carrying
this
family
shame
fought
over
in
childhood
no
real
parents
to
live
with
and
the
burden
of
all
that
wealth
and
power
simon
laughed
bitterly
burden
few
men
would
think
wealth
and
power
a
burden
friar
mathieu
chuckled
no
of
course
not
but
you
know
better
do
you
not
you
have
already
realized
that
you
must
work
constantly
to
use
rightly
what
you
have
or
it
will
destroy
you
as
it
destroyed
your
father
but
simon
thought
of
the
endless
fields
and
forests
of
the
gobignon
domain
in
the
north
what
pleasure
it
was
to
ride
through
them
on
the
hunt
how
the
unquestioning
respect
of
vassals
and
serfs
eased
his
doubts
of
himself
he
thought
of
the
complaisant
village
and
peasant
girls
who
happily
helped
him
forget
that
no
woman
of
noble
blood
would
marry
him
he
reminded
himself
that
only
three
or
four
men
in
all
the
world
were
in
a
position
to
tell
him
what
to
do
no
if
only
the
name
he
bore
were
free
of
the
accursed
stain
of
treachery
he
would
be
perfectly
happy
to
be
the
count
de
gobignon
friar
mathieu
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
you
feel
you
must
do
something
grand
and
noble
to
make
up
for
your
father
wickedness
listen
a
man
can
live
only
his
own
life
the
name
de
gobignon
what
is
it
a
puff
of
air
a
scribble
on
a
sheet
of
parchment
you
are
not
your
name
you
are
not
simon
de
gobignon
simon
blood
turned
to
ice
he
know
but
then
he
realized
friar
mathieu
was
speaking
only
figuratively
but
men
of
great
families
scorn
me
because
i
bear
the
name
de
gobignon
he
said
i
will
have
to
live
out
my
life
in
disgrace
god
respects
you
said
friar
mathieu
quietly
and
intensely
weighed
against
that
the
opinion
of
men
is
nothing
is
simon
thought
and
great
chains
that
had
weighed
him
down
as
long
as
he
could
remember
suddenly
fell
away
he
felt
himself
gasping
for
breath
friar
mathieu
continued
the
beauty
of
my
vows
is
that
with
their
help
i
have
come
to
know
who
i
truly
am
i
have
given
up
my
name
my
possessions
the
love
of
women
my
worldly
position
you
need
not
give
up
all
those
things
but
if
you
can
part
with
them
in
your
mind
you
can
come
to
know
yourself
as
god
knows
you
you
can
see
that
you
are
not
what
people
think
of
you
tears
of
joy
burned
simon
eyelids
you
god
for
allowing
me
to
meet
this
yes
simon
whispered
yes
i
understand
but
said
friar
mathieu
a
note
of
light
reproof
in
his
voice
i
know
you
have
not
told
me
everything
caught
by
surprise
simon
was
thankful
that
the
lantern
up
ahead
started
swinging
from
right
to
left
a
ball
of
light
against
the
stars
de
pirenne
voice
came
back
faintly
to
simon
orvieto
from
the
cart
in
front
of
simon
the
one
carrying
the
tartars
came
the
sound
of
loud
snoring
an
armenian
chuckled
and
said
something
in
a
humorous
tone
and
the
others
laughed
simon
pretended
to
be
intensely
interested
in
what
the
armenians
were
saying
and
in
the
view
up
ahead
simon
said
friar
mathieu
he
has
relieved
me
of
one
burden
can
he
not
take
away
the
other
the
greater
patience
father
we
are
coming
to
the
spot
where
the
road
bends
around
the
mountain
and
we
will
be
able
to
see
orvieto
everyone
will
be
gathering
to
rest
a
bit
let
us
wait
until
we
are
spread
out
on
the
road
again
friar
mathieu
shrugged
as
you
wish
across
the
valley
the
silhouette
of
orvieto
loomed
like
an
enchanted
castle
against
the
moonlit
sky
the
yellow
squares
of
candlelit
windows
glowed
among
the
dark
turrets
and
terraces
the
tall
narrow
windows
of
the
cathedral
church
of
san
giovenale
were
multicolored
ribbons
of
light
simon
found
himself
wondering
where
sophia
the
cardinal
niece
was
right
now
and
what
she
was
doing
when
they
were
stopped
by
the
shrine
of
san
sebastian
simon
took
the
lantern
and
peered
down
at
the
tartars
the
stench
of
wine
and
vomit
hung
heavily
over
their
bed
of
straw
and
both
of
them
were
snoring
loudly
aside
from
being
in
a
stupor
they
seemed
well
enough
the
stringy
black
beard
of
the
younger
one
philip
was
clotted
with
bits
of
food
friar
mathieu
produced
a
comb
from
his
robe
and
cleaned
the
beard
simon
rode
to
the
head
of
the
party
what
are
you
and
the
old
monk
gabbling
about
back
there
asked
alain
he
is
hearing
my
confession
said
simon
lightly
alain
laughed
if
you
have
done
anything
you
need
to
confess
been
clever
about
hiding
it
from
me
when
they
were
back
on
the
road
simon
and
friar
mathieu
took
up
their
position
at
the
end
of
the
line
how
did
you
know
there
was
more
father
you
asked
me
to
keep
what
you
have
told
me
secret
under
the
seal
of
the
confessional
said
friar
mathieu
but
you
have
told
me
nothing
that
is
a
sin
on
your
part
guilt
pierced
simon
heart
like
a
sword
twisting
in
the
wound
as
he
thought
how
he
was
betraying
his
true
father
and
his
mother
have
sworn
to
nicolette
and
roland
never
to
tell
this
to
he
took
a
deep
breath
i
may
never
again
have
a
chance
to
talk
about
it
with
a
wise
person
i
can
another
deep
breath
and
then
the
truth
of
it
is
amalric
de
gobignon
was
not
my
father
friar
mathieu
was
silent
for
a
moment
the
man
who
slew
count
amalric
the
man
your
mother
married
soon
after
the
count
was
dead
his
voice
was
soft
and
full
of
kindness
yes
said
simon
almost
choking
and
now
you
know
my
sin
the
world
thinks
i
am
the
son
of
a
traitor
and
murderer
which
is
bad
enough
but
i
am
not
even
that
man
son
i
am
an
impostor
a
bastard
and
i
have
no
right
to
the
title
of
count
de
gobignon
simon
flicked
the
reins
and
his
palfrey
started
picking
her
way
down
the
road
into
the
vallia
de
campesito
mathieu
clucked
to
his
donkey
and
kept
pace
with
him
do
you
believe
that
you
are
committing
a
grave
sin
by
being
the
count
de
gobignon
my
mother
and
roland
say
no
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
very
good
christians
they
are
full
of
pagan
ideas
i
am
count
amalric
only
male
heir
and
the
blood
of
the
house
of
gobignon
does
flow
in
my
veins
i
am
not
the
son
of
count
amalric
de
gobignon
but
i
am
the
grandson
of
his
father
count
stephen
de
gobignon
friar
mathieu
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
i
am
lost
in
the
tangle
of
bloodlines
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
simon
entire
body
burned
with
shame
as
he
thought
how
accursed
his
family
would
seem
to
anyone
hearing
this
for
the
first
time
the
bastard
son
of
a
bastard
son
the
usurper
of
his
half
uncle
title
tangled
indeed
twisted
was
a
better
word
for
it
in
his
agony
he
whispered
the
words
roland
de
vency
my
true
father
is
the
bastard
son
of
count
stephen
de
gobignon
sired
by
rape
in
languedoc
roland
and
count
amalric
were
half
brothers
god
mercy
exclaimed
friar
mathieu
but
then
you
do
have
some
claim
by
blood
to
the
title
to
whom
else
could
it
go
i
suppose
the
fiefdom
could
go
to
my
oldest
sister
isabelle
and
her
husband
he
is
a
landless
knight
a
vassal
of
the
count
of
artois
my
three
sisters
married
far
beneath
their
stations
because
of
what
count
amalric
did
friar
mathieu
sighed
would
any
great
evil
come
of
it
do
you
think
if
you
were
to
give
up
your
estate
my
mother
and
father
my
true
father
roland
de
vency
would
be
exposed
as
adulterers
we
would
all
be
charged
as
criminals
for
defrauding
the
kingdom
and
the
rightful
heirs
whoever
they
might
be
he
saw
his
mother
kneeling
with
her
head
on
a
chopping
block
and
a
chill
of
horror
went
through
him
simon
this
is
no
easy
question
you
have
set
before
me
this
night
the
lives
of
thousands
of
people
even
the
future
of
the
kingdom
could
be
determined
by
who
holds
the
gobignon
domains
i
think
it
is
not
so
important
that
the
count
de
gobignon
be
the
person
as
that
he
be
the
person
do
you
take
my
meaning
i
think
so
said
simon
what
friar
mathieu
was
saying
gave
him
a
faint
feeling
of
hope
i
know
you
well
enough
to
know
that
the
people
of
gobignon
are
blessed
to
have
you
as
their
seigneur
when
a
bad
man
inherits
a
title
we
say
it
must
be
god
will
and
those
who
owe
him
obedience
are
bound
to
accept
him
might
we
not
say
that
when
a
man
like
you
is
invested
with
a
title
regardless
of
how
he
came
by
it
that
is
god
will
too
in
any
case
simon
we
can
not
settle
this
question
tonight
there
is
too
much
at
stake
and
we
must
proceed
thoughtfully
but
what
if
if
something
happens
to
me
while
i
am
in
sin
simon
pictured
himself
lying
in
a
street
in
orvieto
blood
streaming
from
his
chest
as
sophia
watched
weeping
from
a
distant
window
and
then
he
saw
grinning
demons
in
hell
jabbing
him
with
spears
and
scimitars
i
can
give
you
absolution
conditional
on
your
desire
to
do
whatever
is
right
said
friar
mathieu
promise
god
that
you
will
make
all
haste
to
determine
his
will
in
this
matter
and
that
when
you
know
what
he
wants
you
will
faithfully
do
it
whether
it
be
to
give
up
the
title
or
to
keep
the
title
and
the
secret
i
need
hardly
remind
you
that
god
sees
into
your
heart
and
knows
whether
you
truly
mean
to
set
things
right
say
an
act
of
contrition
the
weight
of
shame
seemed
as
crushing
as
ever
and
simon
did
not
think
friar
mathieu
speaking
latin
words
while
he
himself
spoke
the
formula
of
repentance
would
take
the
burden
away
but
he
began
the
act
of
contrition
his
voice
as
he
uttered
the
prayer
was
barely
audible
over
the
clicking
of
the
horses
hooves
on
the
stony
road
the
rumbling
of
the
two
carts
and
the
rustling
of
the
pines
on
the
hillside
he
repeated
what
friar
mathieu
had
said
to
him
about
being
ready
to
follow
god
will
then
the
old
franciscan
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
the
air
the
road
narrowed
now
so
that
there
was
not
enough
room
for
horses
side
by
side
simon
fell
behind
friar
mathieu
and
nicolette
need
never
know
i
told
the
only
way
they
would
find
out
would
be
if
he
felt
called
upon
to
reveal
the
secret
to
the
world
he
felt
as
if
his
whole
body
were
plunged
into
icy
water
he
realized
that
by
his
promise
to
friar
mathieu
to
god
he
was
embarked
on
a
course
that
could
end
in
ruin
or
worse
for
his
mother
and
father
as
well
as
himself
their
pretense
that
simon
was
amalric
child
was
a
crime
he
saw
them
all
brought
as
prisoners
before
king
louis
how
could
he
bear
to
face
the
king
whom
he
admired
more
than
any
other
man
in
france
even
more
than
his
own
true
father
what
punishment
would
the
king
mete
out
to
them
would
they
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
locked
away
in
lightless
dungeons
would
they
have
to
die
for
their
crime
surely
god
would
not
ask
that
of
him
and
then
simon
might
decide
with
god
help
that
he
had
the
best
right
of
anyone
to
the
count
coronet
if
he
kept
it
and
kept
the
secret
of
his
parentage
it
would
be
through
his
own
choice
no
mortal
would
thrust
that
choice
upon
him
he
began
to
feel
better
he
started
humming
a
tune
an
old
crusader
song
roland
had
taught
him
called
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
until
now
other
hands
had
shaped
his
life
from
this
moment
on
he
would
hold
his
destiny
in
his
own
hands
may
i
disturb
you
for
a
moment
your
signory
before
you
retire
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
chief
steward
was
a
man
with
long
white
hair
streaked
with
black
simon
had
just
set
foot
to
the
steps
leading
to
the
third
story
of
the
monaldeschi
palace
where
his
bedchamber
waited
he
most
definitely
did
not
want
to
be
disturbed
this
evening
but
the
steward
had
shown
gravity
and
discretion
arranging
for
the
drunken
tartars
to
be
bundled
off
to
bed
and
simon
felt
that
whatever
he
might
say
would
be
worth
listening
to
late
this
afternoon
a
vagabondo
came
to
our
door
he
claims
to
be
a
former
retainer
of
yours
he
begs
an
audience
with
you
most
humbly
he
says
to
tell
you
he
waits
in
the
kitchen
we
can
keep
him
till
tomorrow
or
we
can
put
him
out
in
the
street
or
you
can
see
him
whatever
your
signory
desires
a
former
retainer
a
sour
suspicion
began
to
grow
in
simon
mind
did
he
at
least
tell
you
his
name
yes
your
signory
sordello
simon
felt
hot
blood
pounding
at
his
temples
in
immediate
anger
that
dog
had
the
temerity
to
follow
me
all
the
way
to
orvieto
send
him
away
he
said
brusquely
and
do
not
be
gentle
about
it
the
steward
stern
face
remained
expressionless
very
good
your
signory
he
bowed
himself
away
a
good
servant
thought
simon
he
showed
neither
approval
nor
disapproval
simon
started
up
the
stairs
the
devil
could
sordello
have
to
talk
to
me
about
not
call
upon
the
devil
he
may
hear
you
and
halfway
up
the
stairs
simon
felt
the
itch
of
curiosity
growing
stronger
and
stronger
perhaps
sordello
had
been
to
see
count
charles
and
had
some
word
from
him
the
feeling
was
like
a
scab
simon
knew
he
should
not
pick
but
could
not
let
alone
he
turned
the
steward
was
almost
invisible
in
the
shadows
at
the
end
of
the
long
hallway
wait
i
will
go
to
him
in
the
kitchen
on
the
bottom
floor
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
under
a
chimney
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
cauldron
big
enough
to
hold
a
man
simmered
over
a
low
fire
from
it
came
a
strong
smell
of
lamb
chicken
onion
celery
peppers
garlic
cloves
and
other
ingredients
simon
could
not
identify
beyond
the
cauldron
a
trapdoor
covered
the
stairs
to
a
locked
cellar
pantry
where
simon
knew
the
monaldeschi
hoarded
possessions
as
costly
as
jewels
their
collection
of
spices
imported
from
the
east
simon
had
just
a
glimpse
of
the
ruddy
face
with
its
broken
nose
before
the
fell
to
his
knees
and
thumped
his
forehead
on
the
brick
floor
i
could
pop
sordello
into
that
cooking
pot
and
be
done
with
him
for
good
and
thank
you
your
signory
for
being
willing
to
see
me
came
the
muffled
voice
from
the
floor
you
are
far
kinder
than
i
deserve
yes
i
am
said
simon
brusquely
get
up
why
have
you
come
to
me
sordello
rocked
back
on
his
heels
and
sprang
to
his
feet
in
a
single
surprising
motion
simon
told
himself
to
be
wary
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
gruff
with
sordello
but
he
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
man
was
a
fighter
a
murderer
and
one
with
a
vile
and
overquick
temper
as
he
had
proved
in
venice
i
have
no
one
else
to
go
to
sordello
spread
his
empty
hands
he
had
grown
a
short
ragged
black
beard
simon
noticed
he
wore
no
hat
or
cloak
and
his
tunic
and
hose
were
stained
and
tattered
his
tunic
hung
loose
unbelted
no
weapons
that
made
simon
feel
a
bit
easier
the
toe
of
one
boot
was
worn
through
and
the
other
was
bound
with
a
bit
of
rag
to
hold
the
sole
to
the
upper
i
thought
you
would
see
the
count
and
simon
had
half
expected
uncle
charles
would
send
sordello
back
with
a
message
insisting
simon
take
the
fellow
back
into
his
service
sordello
laughed
and
nodded
easy
to
say
the
count
your
signory
not
so
easy
to
do
when
you
are
a
masterless
man
with
an
empty
purse
the
count
likes
to
move
about
and
quickly
at
that
but
i
caught
up
with
him
at
lyons
he
already
knew
the
whole
story
i
wrote
to
him
said
simon
well
your
letter
must
have
been
most
eloquent
your
signory
because
the
count
refused
to
take
me
back
into
his
service
he
called
me
a
fool
and
a
few
other
things
and
told
me
i
deserved
exactly
what
i
got
told
me
if
i
was
out
of
the
city
in
an
hour
he
would
have
me
flogged
i
assumed
that
the
count
reposed
great
confidence
in
you
and
i
felt
i
must
convince
him
that
i
had
done
the
right
thing
in
dismissing
you
he
sounded
in
his
own
ears
as
if
he
were
apologizing
he
reminded
himself
firmly
that
the
scoundrel
had
no
right
to
an
apology
you
convinced
him
all
right
sordello
manner
was
becoming
less
humble
by
the
moment
is
either
going
to
attack
me
or
worse
ask
for
his
position
back
i
must
not
be
soft
with
once
a
man
as
well
known
as
the
count
has
expelled
you
from
his
service
you
ca
find
a
position
anywhere
in
france
or
italy
said
sordello
not
if
your
only
skills
are
fighting
and
singing
i
sold
my
horse
in
milan
i
walked
from
there
on
i
ran
out
of
money
in
pisa
i
starved
and
slept
in
ditches
to
get
here
and
stole
here
and
there
too
i
wager
said
simon
determined
to
be
hard
with
sordello
well
here
you
are
and
why
have
you
come
he
knew
the
answer
perfectly
well
and
was
determined
no
matter
how
the
troubadour
tried
to
play
on
his
sympathies
to
send
him
on
his
way
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
take
sordello
back
into
his
service
and
he
most
definitely
did
not
the
armenians
and
the
tartars
would
never
permit
his
presence
among
them
at
any
rate
regardless
of
what
sordello
claimed
he
would
not
starve
he
could
sing
for
his
supper
in
inns
and
families
and
factions
could
always
use
a
dagger
as
quick
as
sordello
i
could
throw
my
lot
in
with
the
ghibellini
your
signory
but
their
prospects
are
poor
said
sordello
as
if
aware
of
simon
thoughts
the
day
is
coming
when
all
of
italy
will
be
in
the
power
of
the
count
i
want
to
get
back
into
his
good
graces
and
the
only
way
i
can
do
that
is
through
you
your
signory
if
you
take
me
back
he
will
take
me
back
of
trebizond
servant
giancarlo
just
today
was
i
not
wishing
i
could
put
someone
in
the
enemy
camp
simon
stood
staring
into
sordello
eyes
deliberately
making
him
wait
for
an
answer
the
troubadour
eyelids
wrinkled
down
to
slits
but
he
held
simon
gaze
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
had
nothing
for
you
simon
saw
face
brighten
at
the
hint
that
simon
would
offer
him
something
but
there
is
a
way
you
can
serve
me
sordello
began
to
smile
it
does
involve
throwing
your
lot
in
with
the
ghibellini
simon
said
but
you
will
be
serving
me
and
through
me
count
charles
does
that
interest
you
sordello
dropped
to
his
knees
seized
simon
hand
and
kissed
it
with
rough
lips
to
spy
upon
them
your
signory
i
was
made
for
such
work
thank
you
thank
you
for
letting
me
serve
you
command
me
your
signory
i
beg
xix
are
there
any
great
collections
of
books
in
trebizond
fra
tomasso
leaned
forward
intently
and
his
belly
swathed
in
the
white
linen
robe
of
his
order
pushed
the
small
black
writing
desk
toward
daoud
fra
tomasso
dialect
was
easy
for
daoud
to
understand
it
was
the
same
as
lorenzo
since
the
friar
came
from
southern
italy
it
was
the
dialect
daoud
had
learned
in
egypt
but
in
another
sense
conversing
with
was
not
at
all
easy
his
body
tense
daoud
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
alert
for
any
question
that
might
be
meant
to
trap
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
burned
for
a
chance
to
persuade
the
stout
dominican
to
oppose
the
tartar
alliance
he
was
both
hunted
and
hunter
today
yes
father
the
basileus
of
trebizond
the
emperor
has
the
biggest
library
with
the
monks
of
mount
gelesias
not
far
behind
several
of
the
great
families
have
large
collections
of
very
old
manuscripts
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
tell
you
what
is
in
any
of
those
libraries
i
know
more
about
spices
and
silks
than
i
do
about
books
is
there
a
particular
book
you
are
interested
in
daoud
relieved
watched
the
round
face
glow
as
the
dominican
seemed
to
relish
the
possibilities
it
would
never
have
done
to
admit
it
to
ugolini
but
daoud
was
not
without
fear
he
realized
that
a
slip
might
lead
to
his
arrest
and
torture
the
end
of
his
mission
and
finally
death
his
head
had
begun
to
ache
from
the
effort
of
posing
and
answering
all
questions
with
care
but
now
he
sensed
a
way
of
reaching
more
than
anything
else
the
man
would
want
books
books
that
would
help
him
write
more
books
of
his
own
perhaps
his
huge
physical
appetite
was
but
a
reflection
of
his
hunger
for
knowledge
ah
messer
david
he
smiled
and
daoud
realized
that
his
mouth
was
not
small
it
only
looked
small
because
of
the
round
cheeks
on
either
side
of
it
there
is
one
book
i
have
heard
of
that
i
would
give
everything
i
possess
if
i
possessed
anything
to
own
you
are
familiar
with
philosopher
aristotle
daoud
nodded
how
wise
it
had
been
of
baibars
he
thought
to
command
him
to
spend
months
with
a
mullah
from
andalus
who
was
versed
in
the
philosophies
of
the
christians
and
of
their
greek
and
roman
predecessors
daoud
had
even
read
works
by
aristotle
in
arabic
much
of
my
work
like
that
of
my
colleagues
is
based
on
the
writings
of
aristotle
went
on
he
has
been
called
the
master
of
those
who
know
i
call
him
philosopher
his
thought
encompassed
every
subject
under
the
sun
and
the
sun
itself
i
believe
the
ancient
writers
refer
to
a
book
by
aristotle
called
in
latin
caelestiis
of
the
in
it
philosopher
writes
about
the
movement
of
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
the
stars
and
the
planets
and
their
relations
with
one
another
that
book
disappeared
during
the
long
wars
that
led
to
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
every
time
i
meet
a
traveler
from
some
distant
part
of
the
world
i
ask
him
about
does
it
tell
how
the
planets
rule
men
fates
daoud
asked
that
is
a
ridiculous
irrational
and
superstitious
notion
fra
tomasso
waved
the
suggestion
away
with
a
hand
daoud
felt
a
cold
wave
of
terror
had
he
said
something
that
gave
him
away
but
fra
tomasso
leaning
back
in
his
squeaking
chair
seemed
unperturbed
and
daoud
remembered
that
ugolini
studied
the
influence
of
the
stars
on
human
lives
so
it
could
not
be
such
an
belief
the
dominican
pointed
over
his
shoulder
to
the
window
of
his
cell
a
large
rectangle
cut
in
the
curving
whitewashed
wall
this
was
one
of
the
few
rooms
daoud
had
entered
in
italy
that
was
not
covered
with
idolatrous
or
obscene
paintings
and
he
liked
its
austerity
except
of
course
for
the
ubiquitous
figure
of
jesus
the
messiah
crucified
hanging
opposite
the
window
daoud
tried
to
avoid
looking
at
the
crucifixes
because
they
reminded
him
of
his
childhood
but
they
were
everywhere
in
orvieto
aristotle
reasoned
about
the
relations
of
the
heavenly
bodies
to
one
another
fra
tomasso
said
one
account
of
the
declares
that
he
believed
that
the
sun
does
not
move
but
we
see
it
move
daoud
said
surprised
we
think
we
see
it
move
smiled
but
have
you
ever
stood
on
the
deck
of
a
galley
as
it
was
pulling
away
from
the
quay
and
had
the
feeling
that
the
quay
was
moving
while
the
ship
was
standing
still
well
then
what
if
the
earth
is
moving
just
like
a
ship
on
whose
deck
we
stand
while
the
sun
remains
fixed
daoud
thought
about
the
vast
and
solid
earth
and
the
daily
journey
of
the
sun
like
a
bright
lamp
across
the
sky
it
was
which
one
of
them
moved
but
he
sensed
that
fra
tomasso
was
in
love
with
this
idea
he
had
best
not
argue
too
strenuously
against
it
ingenious
he
said
he
thought
to
himself
man
dismisses
astrology
and
approves
greater
i
myself
suspected
that
the
sun
might
be
stationary
while
the
earth
moves
long
before
i
learned
that
aristotle
might
also
believe
so
fra
tomasso
waved
a
hand
toward
the
window
again
his
cell
was
the
top
floor
of
one
of
the
towers
fortifying
the
dominican
chapter
house
an
anthill
of
constant
mysterious
activity
window
overlooked
the
north
side
of
orvieto
wall
there
was
no
covering
on
the
window
and
the
shutters
were
open
to
let
in
the
cool
mountain
air
daoud
gazed
upon
the
rolling
hills
bright
green
in
the
sunlight
beyond
battlements
this
was
a
lovely
country
he
thought
back
in
egypt
the
hills
would
be
brown
this
time
of
year
look
how
much
light
and
heat
we
get
from
the
sun
fra
tomasso
went
on
yet
the
sun
appears
small
i
can
hide
it
with
my
thumb
thumb
could
hide
four
or
five
perhaps
it
small
daoud
said
if
it
is
as
big
as
it
must
be
to
produce
such
light
and
heat
it
must
be
very
far
away
thousands
of
leagues
to
appear
so
small
but
if
it
is
that
far
away
it
must
be
bigger
still
for
its
heat
and
light
to
travel
such
a
distance
the
bigger
it
is
the
farther
away
it
must
be
the
farther
away
it
is
the
bigger
it
must
be
do
you
follow
there
must
be
a
strict
rule
of
proportion
daoud
told
himself
to
ignore
this
nonsense
and
concentrate
on
the
important
thing
that
fra
tomasso
badly
wanted
a
book
by
this
pagan
philosopher
aristotle
that
book
might
be
the
means
of
winning
fra
tomasso
not
that
he
could
be
crudely
bribed
but
certainly
such
a
present
would
favorably
dispose
him
to
what
daoud
had
to
say
and
he
saw
another
way
to
make
the
point
he
had
come
to
make
it
may
be
your
reverence
that
the
book
you
want
has
been
lost
forever
when
i
spoke
of
the
destruction
of
baghdad
the
other
day
i
should
have
mentioned
that
the
tartars
burned
there
a
library
rivaled
only
by
the
great
library
of
alexandria
in
its
prime
his
flesh
turned
cold
that
was
a
mistake
in
his
zeal
he
had
momentarily
forgotten
that
it
was
christians
who
had
destroyed
the
library
of
alexandria
as
the
story
was
often
told
in
egypt
when
the
muslim
warriors
took
alexandria
from
the
christians
they
found
that
most
of
what
had
once
been
the
world
greatest
collection
of
books
had
been
used
to
fuel
the
fires
that
warmed
the
public
baths
but
to
daoud
relief
fra
tomasso
only
shut
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
his
cheeks
quivering
gently
like
a
bowl
of
frumenty
god
forgive
the
tartars
god
will
certainly
not
forgive
fra
tomasso
if
we
help
the
tartars
to
destroy
damascus
and
cairo
or
trebizond
and
constantinople
the
dominican
opened
his
eyes
wide
constantinople
in
the
far
east
they
have
taken
greater
cities
and
conquered
much
larger
empires
fra
tomasso
crossed
himself
but
it
is
god
will
even
as
augustine
tells
us
that
cities
be
destroyed
and
empires
rise
and
fall
the
tartars
may
be
the
builders
of
a
christian
empire
that
embraces
the
whole
world
forbid
it
daoud
was
becoming
exasperated
with
the
fat
perhapses
and
maybes
the
earth
moves
and
the
sun
stands
still
maybe
the
tartars
are
god
means
of
making
the
whole
world
he
warned
himself
not
to
let
his
anger
show
this
might
seem
to
be
a
pleasant
conversation
but
actually
he
was
tiptoeing
around
the
edge
of
a
pit
of
quicksand
still
if
this
clever
restless
mind
could
be
recruited
to
work
against
the
alliance
how
persuasive
it
would
be
daoud
had
already
noticed
that
most
of
the
leaders
of
christendom
listened
when
spoke
but
daoud
dared
not
argue
against
the
belief
that
god
decided
the
fate
of
nations
he
recalled
a
teaching
of
his
sufi
master
sheikh
saadi
he
framed
it
in
his
mind
to
offer
to
your
reverence
truly
we
must
accept
as
the
will
of
god
that
which
has
happened
but
to
think
we
can
guess
what
god
wills
for
the
future
is
sinful
pride
we
can
be
guided
only
by
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
he
has
implanted
in
us
let
his
folded
hands
rest
on
the
great
sphere
of
his
belly
his
blue
eyes
gazed
off
at
a
point
somewhere
behind
daoud
whose
muscles
tightened
as
he
waited
for
the
friar
to
speak
he
watched
through
the
open
window
as
a
flock
of
crows
circled
in
the
sky
they
chose
a
direction
and
dwindled
to
a
cloud
of
black
dots
over
the
green
hills
daoud
realized
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
he
let
it
out
just
as
the
last
crow
disappeared
that
is
well
stated
said
fra
tomasso
i
can
find
no
objection
to
that
elated
daoud
pressed
on
and
it
follows
that
if
we
think
the
tartar
destruction
of
civilization
is
wrong
we
must
fight
against
it
he
hoped
he
did
not
sound
too
eager
would
surely
be
suspicious
if
he
saw
how
badly
daoud
wanted
his
cooperation
i
will
have
to
consider
that
said
fra
tomasso
judiciously
but
perhaps
we
could
teach
the
tartars
the
value
of
civilization
if
we
made
allies
of
them
we
could
make
it
a
condition
that
they
not
destroy
any
more
of
the
great
cities
of
the
muslim
world
indeed
our
missionaries
will
be
among
them
they
can
point
out
what
should
be
saved
daoud
breathing
quickened
as
rage
rumbled
up
inside
him
it
sounded
exactly
as
if
fra
tomasso
meant
that
the
tartars
could
slaughter
all
the
people
of
islam
as
long
as
they
left
the
libraries
intact
using
the
hashishiyya
technique
called
the
face
of
steel
within
the
mask
of
clay
he
walled
off
his
anger
he
would
not
contradict
fra
tomasso
last
idea
he
would
try
instead
to
make
the
beginning
of
a
bargain
those
libraries
of
trebizond
you
asked
me
about
daoud
said
i
am
sure
there
are
many
books
in
them
that
exist
nowhere
else
in
the
world
perhaps
even
the
book
you
mentioned
that
rare
book
of
aristotle
would
you
write
down
its
name
for
me
fra
tomasso
i
will
inquire
about
it
in
my
next
report
to
my
trading
partners
the
dominican
leaned
forward
until
most
of
his
belly
disappeared
below
the
horizon
of
his
desk
in
that
position
he
was
able
to
pull
the
desk
closer
and
search
it
for
a
blank
slip
of
parchment
he
dipped
his
quill
ceremoniously
in
his
inkpot
wrote
briefly
then
carefully
poured
fine
white
sand
from
a
jar
to
absorb
the
excess
ink
daoud
rose
to
take
the
parchment
from
him
if
only
such
a
book
exists
somewhere
in
the
lands
where
power
runs
and
if
only
the
weather
on
the
middle
sea
allows
us
to
get
the
book
here
quickly
and
if
only
it
has
the
effect
on
fra
tomasso
that
i
so
many
ifs
far
too
many
the
outcome
of
a
battle
would
be
easier
to
predict
for
the
thousandth
time
daoud
wished
he
were
leading
troops
in
the
field
rather
than
intriguing
in
the
chambers
of
enemy
leaders
i
understand
it
will
be
possible
to
meet
the
two
tartars
when
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
gives
a
reception
in
their
honor
next
week
said
daoud
will
your
reverence
be
attending
fra
tomasso
nodded
but
i
also
intend
to
talk
with
them
privately
as
i
have
with
you
daoud
tensed
inwardly
as
he
heard
that
it
will
be
interesting
though
to
see
how
they
comport
themselves
in
a
gathering
the
dominican
went
on
yes
i
shall
come
to
the
contessa
and
you
as
cardinal
ugolini
guest
said
daoud
with
modesty
and
what
of
the
execution
of
the
heretic
who
threatened
the
ambassadors
in
the
cathedral
will
your
reverence
witness
that
i
understand
it
should
be
a
most
edifying
spectacle
he
folded
fra
tomasso
bit
of
parchment
and
thrust
it
into
the
pouch
at
his
belt
fra
tomasso
shook
his
head
the
good
of
the
community
demands
that
we
make
an
example
of
the
poor
creature
he
refuses
to
admit
his
errors
still
i
can
not
stand
to
see
a
fellow
human
being
suffer
i
will
not
be
there
so
thought
daoud
contemptuously
the
fat
dominican
was
one
of
those
who
could
justify
the
shedding
of
blood
but
could
not
stand
to
see
it
shed
and
in
the
same
way
might
decide
to
be
for
war
or
for
peace
and
never
see
the
consequences
of
his
decision
daoud
might
wish
to
lead
troops
in
battle
but
he
reminded
himself
that
it
was
in
studios
like
this
where
men
of
influence
thought
and
read
and
argued
that
the
real
war
was
being
fought
xx
the
madman
had
a
loud
voice
daoud
could
hear
him
long
before
he
could
see
the
victim
and
his
torturers
the
people
around
daoud
jostled
and
craned
their
necks
toward
the
sound
of
the
screams
the
heretic
in
accordance
with
his
sentence
had
been
dragged
through
every
street
in
the
city
and
tormented
at
every
intersection
but
most
of
orvieto
citizens
had
been
waiting
in
the
piazza
san
giovenale
to
see
his
final
agonies
before
the
cathedral
he
had
desecrated
the
piazza
was
so
packed
with
people
it
seemed
not
another
person
could
squeeze
in
daoud
had
positioned
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
front
steps
of
the
cathedral
he
faced
a
wooden
platform
newly
built
in
the
center
of
the
piazza
on
four
legs
twice
the
height
of
a
man
above
the
platform
rose
a
tall
pole
the
whole
structure
was
of
white
wood
unseasoned
and
unpainted
which
was
only
sensible
since
it
would
shortly
be
destroyed
bundles
of
firewood
were
piled
under
it
daoud
arms
were
wedged
so
tightly
to
his
side
by
the
crowd
of
people
standing
about
him
that
it
was
an
effort
for
him
to
wipe
his
face
with
his
sleeve
he
had
expected
italy
to
be
cooler
than
egypt
now
in
the
middle
of
the
christian
month
of
september
but
the
damp
heat
of
summer
lingered
thick
gray
clouds
hung
low
over
the
city
sweat
streamed
from
under
daoud
red
velvet
cap
and
he
wished
he
could
wear
a
turban
or
a
burnoose
to
keep
his
forehead
cool
and
dry
at
the
top
of
the
cathedral
steps
in
a
space
cleared
by
papal
guards
stood
six
cardinals
ugolini
was
among
them
he
had
not
wanted
to
witness
the
execution
but
daoud
had
persuaded
him
to
go
his
presence
like
daoud
might
counter
the
suspicion
that
those
who
opposed
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
were
connected
with
the
disturbances
against
them
near
ugolini
stood
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
the
tartars
chief
supporter
in
the
sacred
college
in
a
scarlet
robe
trimmed
with
ermine
and
a
red
hat
he
looked
disdainfully
down
at
another
cardinal
who
ugolini
had
pointed
out
to
daoud
as
guy
le
gros
also
a
frenchman
every
so
often
de
verceuil
would
cock
an
ear
to
the
screams
which
were
coming
closer
or
he
would
glance
that
way
with
bright
eager
eyes
behind
the
cardinals
stood
a
holding
a
staff
bearing
the
pope
standard
a
gold
and
white
banner
blazoned
with
the
crossed
keys
of
peter
in
red
ugolini
had
learned
from
the
pope
majordomo
that
his
holiness
would
not
attend
like
fra
tomasso
urban
had
neither
need
nor
desire
to
see
this
execution
one
who
did
have
to
witness
the
torture
and
death
of
the
heretic
stood
with
folded
arms
on
the
cathedral
steps
he
was
stocky
and
much
shorter
than
the
two
guards
in
yellow
and
blue
the
city
colors
who
stood
holding
halberds
on
either
side
of
him
his
face
was
grim
and
there
were
deep
shadows
around
his
eyes
a
small
thin
mustache
adorned
his
upper
lip
daoud
knew
him
to
be
frescobaldo
podesta
of
orvieto
daoud
eye
moved
on
there
was
the
young
hero
the
man
who
had
captured
the
assassin
count
simon
de
gobignon
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
churchmen
and
the
podesta
speaking
to
no
one
it
seemed
he
had
brought
none
of
his
frankish
henchmen
with
him
the
black
velvet
cap
he
wore
and
his
long
hair
contrasted
with
the
pallor
of
his
thin
face
his
dress
was
rich
but
somber
his
silk
mantle
a
deep
maroon
his
tunic
purple
his
gloved
left
hand
played
nervously
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
that
very
sword
that
had
stricken
the
blade
from
the
hand
it
was
surprising
daoud
thought
that
the
count
sword
was
a
long
curving
scimitar
with
a
jeweled
scabbard
and
hilt
what
was
the
boy
doing
with
a
muslim
sword
a
trophy
of
some
past
crusade
no
doubt
enjoying
your
triumph
here
today
are
you
young
frank
born
to
rank
and
power
and
wealth
with
castles
and
knights
and
servants
and
lands
all
around
you
you
have
probably
never
seen
a
battle
much
less
fought
in
one
and
yet
knowing
not
what
war
is
you
try
to
bring
together
the
tartar
hordes
and
your
crusader
knights
that
they
may
lay
waste
my
country
kill
my
people
and
stamp
out
my
recalling
how
he
and
de
gobignon
had
faced
each
other
at
the
council
daoud
once
again
felt
rage
boil
up
within
him
and
wondered
why
he
hated
the
young
nobleman
so
was
it
because
he
intended
to
use
sophia
to
spy
on
de
gobignon
and
corrupt
him
and
that
she
must
bed
with
him
but
that
was
her
work
daoud
tried
to
tell
himself
just
as
warfare
was
his
but
was
this
warfare
to
pander
to
a
fat
friar
yearning
for
an
old
book
to
send
a
lovely
woman
to
the
bed
of
a
spoiled
young
nobleman
to
incite
a
poor
fool
maddened
by
god
into
getting
himself
tortured
to
death
daoud
wished
he
could
fight
openly
draw
his
sword
and
challenge
de
gobignon
to
drive
him
to
his
knees
to
cut
him
down
to
strike
and
strike
for
the
people
he
loved
and
for
god
kill
him
before
all
as
i
did
to
daoud
like
de
gobignon
was
alone
lorenzo
dared
not
come
the
condemned
man
might
recognize
him
and
call
out
to
him
daoud
would
never
bring
sophia
to
witness
such
a
sight
even
though
there
were
many
women
and
even
children
in
the
crowd
the
previous
night
tilia
had
told
him
that
she
had
rented
for
the
day
a
house
overlooking
the
piazza
from
which
some
important
patrons
would
enhance
their
pleasure
with
tilia
women
by
watching
the
pain
of
the
heretic
daoud
looked
around
at
the
colonnaded
façades
of
the
palaces
around
the
square
wondering
which
were
the
windows
through
which
tilia
depraved
clients
watched
a
howl
went
up
from
the
crowd
in
the
square
the
people
around
daoud
shouting
so
loudly
as
to
deafen
him
he
saw
a
cage
made
of
wooden
poles
rocking
into
the
piazza
people
cheered
and
laughed
two
executioners
in
tunics
their
heads
and
faces
covered
with
red
hoods
stood
on
either
side
of
the
cage
each
man
holding
in
his
hands
a
pair
of
pincers
standing
on
tiptoe
daoud
saw
on
the
platform
of
the
cart
a
black
iron
dish
from
which
ribbons
of
gray
smoke
arose
the
prisoner
squatting
in
the
cage
was
silent
for
the
moment
even
at
this
distance
daoud
could
see
his
shoulders
shaking
spasmodically
with
his
panting
he
was
naked
and
all
over
his
flesh
were
bleeding
blackened
wounds
the
executioners
thrust
the
ends
of
their
pincers
into
the
coals
and
held
them
there
when
they
raised
them
out
and
brandished
them
the
claws
were
glowing
red
they
turned
to
the
prisoner
who
started
screaming
at
once
one
executioner
thrust
his
pincers
through
the
front
of
the
cage
the
prisoner
tried
to
back
away
but
the
cage
was
too
small
he
only
pressed
his
buttocks
against
the
bars
behind
him
where
the
other
executioner
had
crept
and
now
dug
the
jaws
of
his
pincers
into
the
man
flesh
as
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
daoud
heard
the
sizzle
the
man
scream
rose
to
a
pitch
that
made
daoud
ears
ring
the
executioner
held
up
his
pincers
with
a
gobbet
of
burnt
flesh
caught
in
them
for
the
crowd
to
see
then
slung
them
so
that
the
bit
of
meat
flew
through
the
air
daoud
saw
people
reach
up
to
grab
at
it
man
is
dying
horribly
because
of
the
thought
bit
into
heart
like
the
claws
when
sophia
had
said
as
much
accusingly
to
him
he
had
shrugged
it
off
now
he
had
to
face
the
fact
your
guilt
pierce
you
through
the
heart
do
not
armor
yourself
against
it
do
not
run
away
from
it
above
all
do
not
turn
your
back
on
so
saadi
had
advised
him
after
he
avenged
himself
on
kassar
the
sands
of
the
eastern
desert
were
the
color
of
drying
blood
the
hooves
of
daoud
pony
sank
into
them
with
each
step
and
he
wished
he
had
a
camel
to
ride
their
training
troop
had
never
traveled
this
far
south
and
nicetas
had
been
a
fool
daoud
thought
to
go
hunting
in
unknown
and
dangerous
country
with
only
a
pony
to
ride
no
wonder
he
had
not
come
back
yesterday
probably
the
sun
had
killed
the
pony
and
nicetas
was
crouched
in
some
wadi
waiting
to
be
rescued
should
have
gone
with
but
they
had
been
friends
and
more
than
friends
for
two
years
and
from
time
to
time
each
needed
to
be
alone
they
both
understood
that
and
so
when
the
naqeeb
mahmoud
gave
them
a
day
of
rest
after
the
trek
down
from
el
kahira
and
nicetas
said
he
wanted
to
go
out
alone
to
get
himself
a
pair
of
antelope
horns
daoud
simply
hugged
him
and
sent
him
on
his
way
daoud
felt
the
murderous
heat
of
the
noon
sun
on
his
head
through
his
burnoose
ten
times
hotter
here
than
at
el
kahira
now
a
hundred
leagues
to
the
north
the
wind
filled
the
air
with
red
dust
and
he
had
wrapped
a
scarf
over
his
nose
and
mouth
only
his
eyes
were
exposed
looking
for
nicetas
horns
not
even
a
lizard
could
live
in
this
he
should
get
into
the
shade
but
he
did
not
want
to
stop
searching
if
nicetas
were
hurt
and
lying
out
in
this
sun
it
would
burn
him
to
death
daoud
saw
a
line
of
hills
off
to
his
left
there
was
shade
there
and
nicetas
would
try
to
reach
shade
he
tapped
his
shoulder
lightly
with
his
switch
and
turned
its
head
toward
the
hills
nearly
there
he
saw
what
looked
like
a
black
rock
ahead
of
him
could
it
be
a
body
for
a
moment
his
heart
hammered
no
it
was
too
big
his
pony
floundered
on
through
the
sand
till
they
reached
the
dark
shape
it
was
nicetas
pony
dead
windblown
sand
half
covered
it
but
he
was
sure
of
it
nicetas
pony
was
black
daoud
swung
down
from
his
horse
looping
the
reins
around
his
wrist
so
it
could
not
run
off
and
knelt
to
examine
the
dead
pony
he
brushed
away
sand
from
the
forehead
three
white
dots
he
knew
those
markings
well
he
scooped
sand
away
from
the
dead
pony
and
found
an
arrow
jutting
out
of
the
chest
in
spite
of
the
fiery
sun
his
body
went
cold
wild
sudanese
were
said
to
prowl
this
desert
he
jerked
on
the
arrow
it
had
gone
in
deep
and
the
head
must
be
broad
it
took
him
long
to
tear
it
free
the
head
was
and
made
of
steel
with
edges
sudanese
tribesmen
had
no
such
arrows
even
mamelukes
had
only
a
few
each
mameluke
carried
two
or
three
to
use
against
a
opponent
oh
god
help
me
find
nicetas
he
prayed
nicetas
was
out
there
somewhere
daoud
pushed
out
of
his
mind
the
thought
that
he
might
be
dead
was
this
punishment
for
their
sin
of
loving
each
other
he
wondered
as
he
mounted
his
little
horse
god
frowned
on
men
lying
with
men
the
mullahs
said
but
everyone
knew
that
men
especially
young
men
far
from
women
often
took
comfort
in
one
another
he
pulled
his
burnoose
farther
down
over
his
eyes
to
shade
them
better
against
the
sun
he
wanted
water
but
he
would
not
let
himself
drink
until
he
had
reached
the
hills
he
might
find
nicetas
there
and
nicetas
might
need
the
water
the
hills
thrust
abruptly
out
of
the
sand
in
long
vertical
folds
half
blinded
by
the
glare
he
could
see
only
opaque
blackness
where
the
sun
did
not
strike
them
he
thought
he
saw
movement
in
one
shadow
he
kicked
the
pony
driving
it
to
struggle
faster
through
the
sand
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
a
deep
crevice
sliced
into
the
hillside
daoud
rode
into
it
cautiously
whoever
killed
nicetas
mount
might
still
be
somewhere
about
once
out
of
the
sun
he
slid
down
from
the
saddle
he
saw
no
water
but
there
was
a
dead
tamarisk
its
branches
like
supplicating
arms
at
the
mouth
of
the
crevice
he
tied
the
pony
to
a
limb
and
moved
slowly
deeper
into
the
shadow
he
looked
down
at
the
floor
of
the
crevice
paved
with
drifting
sand
and
tiny
pebbles
he
felt
a
pain
in
his
heart
as
he
saw
a
trail
of
dark
circular
spots
each
about
the
size
of
his
hand
it
could
be
a
wounded
animal
he
told
himself
then
he
saw
a
palmprint
the
same
dried
color
and
the
pain
in
his
heart
sharpened
he
saw
the
movement
again
at
the
far
end
of
the
crevice
a
figure
lay
with
its
legs
stretched
out
before
it
its
back
propped
against
the
brown
stone
pale
hands
were
clasped
over
its
stomach
he
heard
a
low
moaning
sound
and
realized
it
was
coming
not
from
nicetas
but
from
his
own
mouth
daoud
ran
and
fell
to
his
knees
beside
him
the
eyes
widened
and
the
amber
gaze
turned
in
his
direction
the
greek
boy
face
was
reddened
with
dust
that
clung
to
his
sweat
his
lips
partially
open
were
so
dry
and
encrusted
they
looked
like
scabs
daoud
put
his
hand
on
nicetas
cheeks
his
face
was
burning
now
the
hurt
in
daoud
heart
was
like
death
itself
am
going
to
lose
but
this
was
no
time
to
wail
and
weep
he
must
do
everything
he
could
it
might
yet
be
god
will
that
he
save
his
friend
him
live
oh
god
and
i
will
never
sin
with
him
i
knew
you
would
come
the
voice
was
so
faint
daoud
could
barely
hear
it
above
the
wind
whistling
past
the
mouth
of
the
crevice
daoud
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
his
pony
to
get
his
water
bottle
he
untwisted
the
stopper
over
his
friend
mouth
the
greek
boy
shook
his
head
i
can
not
swallow
just
pour
a
little
in
my
mouth
to
wet
it
daoud
saw
deep
red
cracks
in
nicetas
lips
the
water
trickled
out
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
streaked
his
dusty
cheeks
a
hundred
thoughts
crowded
daoud
mind
his
eyes
burned
and
pain
pounded
at
his
chest
all
he
said
was
what
happened
to
you
it
was
kassar
nicetas
whispered
he
got
me
with
his
first
arrow
then
he
shot
the
pony
and
it
fell
on
me
he
rode
me
down
he
took
my
bow
before
i
could
get
free
all
this
time
daoud
thought
kassar
had
said
nothing
done
nothing
since
the
day
nicetas
beat
him
at
casting
the
rumh
two
years
kassar
had
waited
he
bent
forward
to
take
nicetas
in
his
arms
but
the
greek
boy
shook
his
head
do
not
move
me
it
will
hurt
too
much
where
are
you
hit
in
my
back
still
in
me
i
broke
off
the
shaft
was
i
such
a
fool
to
think
we
were
safe
it
ca
be
a
very
bad
wound
nicetas
closed
his
eyes
bad
enough
that
he
could
use
me
for
his
pleasure
and
i
could
not
fight
him
off
a
dizzying
blackness
blinded
daoud
his
skull
felt
as
if
it
were
going
to
burst
by
god
and
the
prophet
i
will
kill
him
i
want
you
to
did
he
do
any
more
to
hurt
you
yes
he
got
me
here
he
parted
his
hands
and
raised
them
from
his
stomach
his
white
cotton
robe
was
caked
with
black
blood
and
there
was
a
tear
in
the
center
the
wound
was
not
wide
but
daoud
knew
that
it
must
be
very
deep
he
made
sure
to
use
his
rumh
you
see
because
that
was
how
you
beat
him
daoud
wanted
only
to
hold
nicetas
and
cry
but
he
sensed
that
what
would
most
comfort
the
greek
boy
would
be
talking
about
what
happened
to
him
after
the
rumh
i
lay
very
still
and
held
my
breath
he
thought
i
was
dead
he
left
me
lying
there
with
the
pony
took
my
weapons
and
my
water
bottle
i
crawled
here
in
the
sun
yesterday
afternoon
i
bled
and
bled
is
going
to
daoud
thought
he
did
not
want
to
believe
it
for
a
moment
he
was
angry
at
nicetas
why
had
he
been
such
a
fool
as
to
come
out
here
alone
and
then
at
himself
why
had
he
let
him
go
and
then
at
god
did
you
let
this
happen
do
you
hate
us
because
we
love
each
other
i
knew
you
would
come
for
me
daoud
i
stayed
alive
to
greet
you
daoud
took
nicetas
hand
i
will
take
you
back
no
bury
me
out
here
let
him
think
you
never
found
me
bide
your
time
as
he
did
give
him
no
reason
to
fear
you
he
fears
you
already
or
he
would
never
have
done
it
this
way
before
the
year
is
out
you
will
look
down
from
paradise
and
see
him
burning
in
hell
i
sorry
i
was
never
strong
enough
to
be
a
mameluke
no
you
strong
not
strong
enough
to
live
said
nicetas
so
faintly
daoud
could
hardly
hear
him
daoud
remember
the
greek
i
taught
you
you
may
meet
someone
else
who
speaks
greek
i
will
never
meet
anyone
like
you
the
tears
spilled
out
over
his
eyelids
and
he
did
not
try
to
brush
them
away
the
hand
he
held
squeezed
his
weakly
then
relaxed
daoud
bent
forward
and
touched
his
mouth
to
the
split
lips
no
breath
came
from
his
friend
body
a
curtain
of
shadow
swept
before
his
eyes
and
he
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
he
thrust
himself
to
his
feet
as
nicetas
head
fell
to
one
side
he
threw
his
arms
over
his
head
and
screamed
arms
still
upraised
he
dropped
to
his
knees
oh
god
his
voice
echoed
back
from
the
walls
of
the
crevice
god
god
god
the
pain
in
his
heart
was
as
if
a
rumh
had
impaled
it
he
felt
that
he
must
die
too
he
could
not
bear
this
loss
never
to
see
his
friend
smile
again
never
to
hear
his
laughter
that
body
he
had
loved
nothing
now
but
unmoving
empty
clay
he
looked
over
at
nicetas
hoping
to
see
a
movement
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
the
rising
of
the
chest
nothing
daoud
would
never
again
look
on
in
admiration
as
the
greek
boy
rode
wildly
standing
in
the
stirrups
shooting
his
arrows
at
the
gallop
or
casting
his
spear
unerringly
at
the
target
they
would
never
as
he
had
dreamed
ride
side
by
side
into
battle
daoud
crumpled
to
the
ground
in
the
position
of
worship
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
sharp
broken
stones
but
he
was
not
worshiping
he
simply
did
not
have
the
strength
to
hold
himself
upright
it
seemed
hours
later
when
he
at
last
stirred
himself
sobbing
he
carried
nicetas
out
to
a
place
near
the
mouth
of
the
crevice
where
the
sand
had
drifted
in
and
with
his
hands
he
dug
there
a
grave
all
along
the
base
of
the
hillside
were
many
loose
brown
stones
chipped
away
by
the
eternal
wind
with
bleeding
hands
he
piled
the
stones
high
over
nicetas
body
but
tried
to
make
the
pile
look
like
a
rock
slide
so
that
no
one
would
know
someone
was
buried
here
he
knelt
weeping
and
talking
to
nicetas
spirit
until
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
as
nicetas
had
told
him
to
do
daoud
had
pretended
when
he
came
back
from
the
desert
that
he
had
no
idea
what
had
happened
to
his
friend
the
naqeeb
had
declared
that
sudanese
tribesmen
or
wild
animals
must
have
gotten
him
daoud
was
not
alone
in
his
grief
many
of
the
boys
in
the
troop
had
liked
nicetas
even
kassar
had
said
words
of
sympathy
his
face
expressionless
and
his
slanted
eyes
opaque
daoud
held
in
his
rage
a
furnace
in
his
heart
and
in
a
choked
voice
he
thanked
kassar
at
first
he
went
about
in
a
daze
unable
to
think
he
told
himself
that
in
spite
of
his
dissembling
kassar
would
be
on
guard
he
would
have
to
choose
a
time
to
take
his
revenge
when
kassar
would
be
preoccupied
and
daoud
himself
must
be
alert
at
all
times
kassar
might
not
be
satisfied
with
killing
only
nicetas
in
spite
of
these
warnings
to
himself
daoud
mind
remained
numb
he
was
he
told
himself
like
a
mall
ball
hit
one
way
by
grief
the
other
way
by
rage
unable
to
take
control
of
his
destiny
that
thought
of
mall
gave
him
the
beginning
of
a
plan
he
let
three
months
go
by
from
the
day
he
found
nicetas
his
plan
was
very
simple
it
left
much
to
luck
and
it
might
fail
utterly
kassar
might
anticipate
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
turn
the
moment
against
him
killing
him
and
claiming
he
was
defending
himself
kassar
friends
might
thwart
daoud
he
would
have
only
this
one
chance
if
he
failed
he
would
be
dead
or
crippled
or
worst
of
all
cast
out
of
the
mamelukes
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
ghulman
a
menial
slave
but
if
he
succeeded
nicetas
would
be
avenged
before
baibars
and
sultan
qutuz
and
all
daoud
and
nicetas
khushdashiya
whatever
punishment
might
befall
him
then
he
thought
he
could
bear
it
for
nicetas
sake
warrior
of
god
is
a
man
who
would
give
his
life
for
his
on
the
day
daoud
decided
to
act
the
bhari
mamelukes
the
slaves
of
the
river

within
sight
of
the
great
pyramids
built
by
the
ancient
of

people
of

kahira

with
shining
eyes
as
their
guardians
assembled
on
the
field

his
personal
mounted
band
playing
trumpets
and
kettledrums
cymbals
and
hautboys
rode
before
them
sultan
qutuz
came
down
from
the
citadel
of
el
kahira
to
watch
the
games
as
the
guest
of
his
mamelukes
the
troops
of

brought
up
the
rear
of
the
parade
on
their
little
ponies
with
their
naqeebs
riding
before
them
the
oldest
boys
in
the
lead
and
the
and
boys
on

at
the
end
they
wore
plain
brown
shirts
and
white
cotton
trousers
and
caps
no
special
marks
of
rank
were
allowed
these
young
slaves
until
they
became
mamelukes
daoud
troop
the
boys
in
their
fifth
year
of
training
rode
immediately
behind
the
mamelukes
each
boy
carried
a
mallet
which
was
as
much
part
of
his
equipment
as
his
bow
his
rumh
his
dabbus
and
his
saif
the
mallets
were
made
of
cedar
and
were
large
and
heavy
they
had
to
be
to
drive
a
wooden
ball
half
the
size
of
a
man
head
slaves
had
pulled
perforated
water
barrels
in
carts
over
the
field
to
lay
the
dust
baibars
and
the
sultan
and
the
emirs
seated
themselves
on
cushions
in
an
open
pavilion
facing
the
center
of
the
field
daoud
teammates
chattered
excitedly
they
loved
mall
and
to
play
before
the
sultan
was
a
special
honor
kassar
the
captain
of
their
team
boasted
that
he
would
make
ten
goals
that
day
theirs
was
to
be
the
second
match
hefting
his
mallet
daoud
watched
the
first
match
also
between
two
teams
of
trainees
each
team
of
eight
riders
tried
to
drive
the
wooden
ball
between
a
pair
of
stone
pillars
painted
with
red
and
yellow
stripes
defended
by
the
other
team
with
every
crack
of
a
mallet
against
the
ball
a
roar
went
up
from
the
watching
mamelukes
a
judge
with
an
hourglass
called
time
halfway
through
the
match
to
let
the
field
be
watered
again
and
the
teams
change
ponies
by
the
end
of
the
match
the
dust
was
so
thick
daoud
could
not
see
who
had
won
but
he
did
not
care
he
felt
utterly
calm
he
was
past
anger
and
past
fear
he
thought
only
of
watching
for
the
right
moment
now
it
was
time
for
their
team
kassar
daoud
and
the
other
six
riders
lined
up
on
the
east
side
of
the
field
the
eight
members
of
the
troop
they
were
playing
against
forming
on
the
other
side
the
judge
set
the
wooden
ball
yellow
with
a
bright
red
stripe
around
its
middle
in
the
center
of
the
field
the
sultan
held
out
a
blue
silk
scarf
and
dropped
it
kassar
and
the
captain
of
the
other
team
raced
at
the
ball
from
opposite
goals
screaming
their
war
cries
kassar
whirled
his
mallet
over
his
head
and
his
pony
legs
were
a
blur
in
the
dust
he
reached
the
ball
an
instant
before
his
opponent
his
mallet
slammed
into
the
ball
with
a
crack
like
the
splitting
of
a
board
and
the
ball
flew
halfway
toward
the
enemy
goal
the
ball
was
in
play
and
now
the
other
riders
could
join
in
will
make
not
even
one
goal
today
daoud
thought
as
he
galloped
across
the
field
with
his
team
the
players
on
the
other
side
were
trying
to
hit
the
ball
away
from
their
goal
kassar
had
ridden
into
their
midst
his
pony
nimbly
following
the
ball
he
held
his
mallet
low
to
hit
through
the
legs
of
the
opposing
team
ponies
two
of
the
opponents
had
stayed
back
by
their
goalposts
to
deflect
the
ball
should
kassar
hit
it
kassar
was
on
top
of
the
ball
daoud
kicked
his
pony
ribs
hard
and
galloped
after
him
as
kassar
swung
low
from
his
saddle
to
hit
the
ball
daoud
drove
in
on
him
kassar
glanced
up
fear
flashing
across
his
broad
face
whatever
passed
through
his
mind
was
his
last
thought
daoud
swung
his
mallet
up
from
the
ground
smashing
it
into
kassar
jaw
the
force
of
the
blow
knocked
the
white
cap
from
his
head
his
pony
ran
free
of
the
melee
kassar
reeled
unconscious
but
his
horse
nomad
instinct
held
him
in
the
saddle
daoud
jerked
his
pony
around
to
race
after
kassar
in
an
instant
he
was
beside
his
enemy
he
was
about
to
kill
a
khushdashiyin
a
barracks
comrade
in
open
defiance
of
the
code
of
the
mamelukes
and
in
front
of
his
emir
and
his
sultan
am
a
dead
he
thought
as
he
swung
the
mallet
high
his
body
felt
cold
as
death
and
he
hesitated
as
he
did
so
kassar
turned
his
head
and
daoud
saw
consciousness
struggling
to
return
to
his
glazed
eyes
this
was
daoud
last
chance
to
avenge
nicetas
he
heard
a
distant
roar
of
command
from
the
naqeeb
mahmoud
but
he
ignored
it
he
brought
the
mallet
down
with
all
his
strength
on
the
glistening
black
hair
the
shock
of
the
contact
ran
up
his
arm
and
into
his
shoulder
kassar
started
to
fall
daoud
struck
again
with
the
mallet
kassar
pitched
from
his
pony
back
as
he
struck
the
ground
daoud
smashed
the
mallet
into
his
head
a
third
time
just
as
if
he
were
hitting
a
ball
he
tried
to
hit
hard
enough
to
knock
kassar
head
right
off
his
neck
daoud
saw
the
head
suddenly
distorted
flattening
and
knew
the
skull
was
crushed
kassar
lay
on
the
ground
on
his
back
only
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
his
mouth
hanging
open
dust
half
obscured
his
body
daoud
heard
shouts
from
the
bystanders
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
they
were
saying
he
saw
riders
the
other
players
racing
toward
him
a
silence
fell
on
the
playing
field
get
down
from
your
horse
it
was
mahmoud
who
had
run
out
into
the
field
on
foot
as
daoud
and
mahmoud
walked
across
the
field
the
naqeeb
said
you
will
answer
to
el
malik
qutuz
and
to
emir
baibars
for
this
fool
whatever
your
quarrel
was
could
you
not
have
settled
it
in
private
have
you
forgotten
that
baibars
is
a
kipchaq
he
will
not
forgive
you
despite
his
joy
at
seeing
nicetas
murderer
dead
daoud
now
felt
terror
clutching
his
throat
as
he
approached
the
two
seated
figures
in
their
splendid
robes
at
the
side
of
the
field
now
that
the
deed
was
done
and
could
not
be
undone
he
dreaded
facing
these
two
mighty
judges
is
a
kipchaq
but
it
was
baibars
who
bought
me
for
the
daoud
thought
wonder
which
will
mean
more
to
him
this
baibars
and
qutuz
sat
side
by
side
on
cushions
in
the
shade
of
a
silken
canopy
baibars
wore
an
egret
plume
symbol
of
valor
on
his
green
turban
his
wide
harsh
mouth
was
tight
under
the
red
mustache
his
good
eye
as
empty
of
feeling
as
the
blind
one
that
was
crossed
by
a
vertical
saber
scar
god
if
i
must
die
for
what
i
have
done
let
it
be
a
quick
and
clean
death
and
then
i
will
join
el
malik
qutuz
sultan
of
el
kahira
a
mameluke
of
a
kurdish
tribe
was
somewhat
older
than
baibars
his
face
was
with
tiny
wrinkles
his
beard
greased
so
that
it
jutted
like
the
prow
of
a
galley
was
such
a
flat
black
that
it
must
surely
be
dyed
he
wore
a
large
black
turban
and
full
black
robes
with
gold
embroidery
daoud
fell
to
his
knees
and
prostrated
himself
before
the
sultan
get
up
and
take
off
your
cap
said
qutuz
without
preliminary
daoud
rose
to
his
feet
lifting
his
cap
from
his
head
look
at
that
blond
hair
said
qutuz
wonderingly
i
thought
he
had
the
look
of
a
frank
about
him
bunduqdari
i
could
have
told
you
that
said
baibars
flatly
he
belongs
to
me
he
is
known
as
daoud
ibn
abdallah
his
parents
were
franks
we
took
him
when
we
freed
ascalon
he
talked
to
qutuz
daoud
noted
as
if
they
were
equals
baibars
turned
his
one
eye
on
daoud
why
did
you
do
this
he
said
softly
you
are
not
a
fool
and
you
would
not
kill
out
of
foolishness
effendi
he
killed
my
friend
said
daoud
making
himself
stand
straight
and
look
levelly
at
baibars
the
emir
might
sentence
him
to
death
but
he
would
show
himself
a
true
mameluke
he
would
not
cringe
or
beg
he
would
honor
nicetas
how
do
you
know
daoud
told
baibars
how
he
had
found
nicetas
in
the
desert
and
what
he
had
said
to
him
he
kept
his
voice
level
trying
not
to
let
his
fear
show
you
should
have
reported
this
to
me
shouted
naqeeb
mahmoud
his
white
beard
quivering
the
naqeeb
would
bear
some
blame
daoud
thought
for
this
breach
of
discipline
but
daoud
only
turned
to
him
and
threw
his
own
words
back
at
him
among
mamelukes
he
who
is
strongest
rules
perhaps
he
should
not
be
so
defiant
he
thought
both
the
sultan
and
baibars
liked
to
show
themselves
to
be
men
of
great
generosity
but
not
to
a
julban
who
has
broken
the
he
can
not
kill
his
comrade
and
go
unpunished
said
qutuz
he
should
be
beheaded
at
the
words
even
though
he
had
thought
himself
prepared
for
them
daoud
felt
something
shrink
with
dread
inside
him
he
felt
the
blade
slicing
through
his
neck
the
sultan
had
spoken
his
life
was
over
he
is
too
valuable
to
be
beheaded
said
baibars
believe
me
my
lord
daoud
felt
as
if
he
had
fallen
from
a
cliff
and
a
strong
hand
had
reached
out
and
was
dragging
him
back
he
was
breathless
with
a
relief
he
barely
dared
to
feel
he
tried
to
keep
his
face
and
body
still
as
the
two
great
ones
debated
his
fate
but
he
could
not
stop
his
fists
from
clenching
the
sultan
eyes
narrowed
and
a
deep
crease
appeared
between
his
brows
as
he
turned
to
baibars
is
this
frankish
murderer
a
protégé
of
yours
then
baibars
nodded
i
have
seen
reason
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
him
if
it
please
my
lord
what
did
that
mean
what
had
baibars
seen
in
him
that
day
in
the
slave
market
and
why
had
baibars
come
there
that
day
have
long
watched
for
such
a
one
as
you
who
could
have
the
outward
look
of
a
christian
knight
but
the
mind
and
heart
of
a
mameluke
one
like
you
could
be
a
great
weapon
against
the
enemies
of
the
it
does
not
please
me
said
qutuz
shortly
there
is
too
much
breaking
of
rules
among
the
bhari
mamelukes
he
spoke
daoud
thought
as
if
he
were
not
originally
a
mameluke
himself
there
is
a
law
among
mamelukes
more
binding
than
any
lesser
rule
said
baibars
quietly
he
who
feels
himself
greatly
sinned
against
must
strike
back
if
he
can
not
do
that
he
is
not
enough
of
a
man
to
be
a
mameluke
even
as
this
foolish
boy
said
the
strong
must
rule
daoud
saw
grave
approval
in
baibars
brown
face
and
realized
that
it
did
not
matter
at
all
to
baibars
that
kassar
was
a
kipchaq
his
joy
grew
as
he
realized
that
he
had
baibars
on
his
side
daoud
remembered
nicetas
dying
words
am
not
strong
enough
to
be
a
together
we
were
strong
enough
to
do
what
had
to
be
qutuz
said
if
all
mamelukes
believed
only
in
the
rule
of
the
strongest
we
would
have
chaos
only
if
it
were
not
certain
who
strongest
said
baibars
quietly
baibars
and
qutuz
sat
looking
at
each
other
in
a
grave
and
thoughtful
silence
that
seemed
to
stretch
on
forever
finally
qutuz
turned
away
i
must
allow
you
to
discipline
the
bhari
mamelukes
or
not
discipline
them
as
you
see
fit
bunduqdari
that
is
your
responsibility
thank
you
my
lord
said
baibars
with
just
a
hint
of
sarcasm
he
turned
to
mahmoud
take
him
away
daoud
crossed
the
field
walking
beside
mahmoud
wondering
how
his
khushdashiya
clustered
together
around
what
had
been
their
goal
would
greet
him
have
killed
daoud
thought
have
taken
a
it
was
the
first
time
and
he
felt
glad
and
proud
but
he
would
gladly
give
up
this
proud
moment
to
have
nicetas
back
his
grief
for
nicetas
was
sharp
as
ever
not
at
all
eased
by
vengeance
it
wrong
to
have
done
as
i
did
and
to
feel
this
way
a
sharp
voice
rang
out
behind
them
mahmoud
daoud
and
the
naqeeb
turned
together
and
daoud
was
amazed
to
see
that
baibars
splendid
in
his
red
satin
robe
and
green
turban
was
approaching
them
daoud
and
mahmoud
rushed
to
stand
before
him
rigid
and
trembling
mahmoud
baibars
said
when
we
return
to
raudha
island
tonight
you
will
issue
this
fool
the
steel
helmet
of
a
mameluke
trimmed
with
black
fur
he
swung
that
searching
blue
eye
back
to
daoud
tonight
at
the
gray
mosque
i
will
perform
the
ceremony
that
frees
you
you
will
be
a
part
of
my
personal
guard
from
now
on
dizzy
with
exultation
daoud
fell
to
his
knees
and
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
cool
brown
earth
before
the
emir
tears
burned
his
eyes
and
dripped
to
the
ground
may
god
praise
and
bless
you
emir
baibars
he
cried
get
up
baibars
said
briskly
had
you
let
your
friend
go
unavenged
i
would
no
longer
be
interested
in
you
as
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
daoud
saw
mahmoud
smiling
through
his
beard
you
learned
well
the
lesson
i
tried
to
teach
you
dizzy
daoud
tried
to
grasp
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
minds
of
these
men
without
his
realizing
it
baibars
said
now
you
must
learn
to
kill
with
more
grace
and
subtlety
i
shall
see
that
you
are
trained
by
masters
as
i
did
when
i
sent
you
to
sheikh
abu
hamid
saadi
i
must
go
to
sheikh
saadi
thought
daoud
he
may
tell
me
if
i
did
now
it
was
over
ten
years
since
kassar
had
killed
nicetas
and
daoud
had
killed
kassar
and
though
daoud
had
never
felt
guilty
for
killing
kassar
he
understood
what
saadi
meant
about
facing
guilt
if
he
had
not
understood
he
might
have
told
himself
that
it
was
not
his
fault
it
was
these
christian
brutes
who
chose
to
torment
the
poor
madman
in
this
way
he
might
have
told
himself
that
lorenzo
not
he
had
found
the
man
and
brought
him
to
orvieto
he
might
simply
have
said
as
he
had
said
to
sophia
that
in
war
there
must
be
innocent
victims
he
might
have
reminded
himself
that
he
and
lorenzo
thought
that
the
man
would
only
raise
a
commotion
in
the
church
not
that
he
would
draw
a
knife
and
if
he
consented
to
any
of
those
thoughts
he
would
have
been
pinching
off
a
fragment
of
his
soul
just
as
the
executioners
pinched
off
bits
of
this
man
body
he
forced
himself
to
watch
as
the
cage
moved
slowly
into
the
piazza
and
the
executioners
tore
again
and
again
at
the
victim
body
with
their
pincers
he
saw
now
that
six
laughing
young
men
were
pulling
the
cart
of
course
no
beast
its
nostrils
assailed
by
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
and
its
ears
by
the
victim
howls
of
agony
could
remain
calm
and
pull
a
cart
through
this
frenzied
crowd
these
were
the
same
people
who
had
rioted
against
the
tartars
a
month
ago
the
day
this
man
was
arrested
now
they
cheered
and
jeered
at
the
death
of
the
tartars
assailant
and
that
meant
daoud
thought
that
the
man
death
was
in
vain
the
cage
drew
near
him
now
as
it
approached
the
scaffold
daoud
held
his
breath
at
the
thought
that
the
condemned
man
might
look
him
in
the
eye
could
i
bear
that
but
the
man
eyes
he
saw
were
squeezed
shut
with
fear
and
pain
and
guilt
continued
to
cut
into
daoud
like
the
twisting
knife
blade
of
a
hashishiyyin
better
man
than
i
would
have
found
a
way
to
stir
the
people
and
keep
them
stirred
so
that
lives
would
not
be
the
two
executioners
had
set
aside
their
pincers
and
were
dragging
the
heretic
up
the
ladder
to
the
scaffold
his
feet
dangled
on
the
rungs
on
the
platform
stood
another
man
waiting
for
the
victim
daoud
felt
his
eyes
open
wide
and
his
lips
begin
to
work
silently
when
he
saw
who
the
third
executioner
was
his
face
was
left
bare
by
the
executioner
black
hood
whose
long
point
hung
down
the
side
of
his
head
past
his
chin
no
use
to
mask
this
face
his
body
made
him
instantly
recognizable
to
anyone
who
had
ever
seen
him
before
he
smiled
a
serene
almost
kindly
smile
down
at
the
moaning
man
who
was
being
dragged
up
the
ladder
toward
him
he
held
a
cook
knife
in
one
hand
with
a
blade
as
wide
as
his
wrist
and
as
long
as
his
forearm
if
he
were
not
holding
the
knife
up
to
display
it
to
his
victim
the
tip
of
it
would
have
rested
on
the
platform
because
the
executioner
back
was
bent
forward
as
if
it
had
been
broken
in
some
accident
long
ago
firewood
seller
at
lucera
daoud
head
swam
as
he
tried
to
fathom
how
the
crippled
dwarf
who
had
been
part
of
the
crowd
of
tradesmen
entering
the
great
hohenstaufen
stronghold
with
him
who
had
witnessed
daoud
arrest
by
celino
at
the
gate
and
even
seemed
to
pray
in
his
behalf
could
be
here
conducting
a
public
execution
in
the
city
of
the
pope
he
must
have
been
a
guelfo
spy
by
coincidence
infiltrating
lucera
at
the
same
time
as
daoud
he
had
been
in
manfred
pastry
kitchen
had
he
really
been
sleeping
or
had
he
seen
manfred
lorenzo
and
daoud
walk
through
together
he
sees
me
here
in
the
crowd
he
will
expose
me
the
people
around
daoud
their
breath
reeking
of
onions
and
garlic
pressed
him
so
tightly
he
could
barely
move
twisting
his
body
he
managed
to
get
his
back
turned
to
the
scaffold
this
put
him
with
a
man
in
a
tunic
with
a
thick
black
beard
and
mustache
the
man
laughed
at
him
would
you
turn
away
have
you
no
stomach
for
erculio
holy
work
daoud
fixed
the
man
with
a
stare
thinking
of
what
he
would
like
to
do
to
him
he
realized
though
that
if
he
tried
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
piazza
the
little
man
on
the
scaffold
would
certainly
notice
him
if
he
simply
stayed
where
he
was
and
watched
his
would
be
one
face
in
thousands
and
the
dwarf
obviously
had
more
pressing
business
he
reached
up
to
the
soft
cap
on
his
head
making
sure
it
covered
most
of
his
blond
hair
without
a
word
to
the
man
in
brown
who
had
shrunk
from
his
stare
daoud
turned
and
faced
the
platform
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
bent
dwarf
erculio
was
that
his
name
bless
himself
just
as
he
had
at
lucera
daoud
heart
pounded
as
he
imagined
himself
and
lorenzo
and
ugolini
suffering
as
this
naked
bleeding
blistered
heretic
was
sophia
god
forbid
i
would
cut
her
throat
myself
before
i
let
anything
like
this
happen
to
the
thought
of
sophia
being
tortured
in
public
was
such
agony
that
he
wanted
to
scream
and
fight
his
way
out
of
the
piazza
he
did
sufi
breathing
exercises
to
calm
himself
they
had
tied
the
moaning
victim
down
on
a
wooden
sawhorse
lying
on
his
back
he
was
low
enough
that
the
bent
man
could
easily
reach
any
part
of
him
one
of
the
executioners
in
red
held
the
victim
mouth
open
and
the
little
man
reached
in
with
one
hand
pulled
forth
the
tongue
and
sliced
it
off
like
a
jongleur
producing
an
apple
from
his
sleeve
he
waved
the
severed
tongue
at
the
crowd
then
threw
it
a
forest
of
hands
clutched
at
it
common
people
everywhere
daoud
recalled
believed
that
parts
of
the
bodies
of
condemned
men
could
be
used
in
magic
it
took
a
moment
for
erculio
to
saw
the
heretic
nose
off
with
tongue
and
nose
gone
the
condemned
man
screams
no
longer
sounded
human
they
were
like
the
bellowings
of
a
steer
being
clumsily
slaughtered
daoud
realized
that
he
was
grateful
for
the
problem
that
the
little
man
presented
it
gave
him
something
urgent
to
think
about
other
than
what
he
was
watching
erculio
now
stuck
the
knife
point
down
in
the
platform
and
used
both
hands
to
tear
the
heretic
eyeballs
out
the
tormented
man
was
silent
now
he
must
have
fainted
the
little
man
danced
about
him
jabbing
him
repeatedly
with
the
knife
until
the
screams
started
again
were
the
nobles
and
churchmen
enjoying
this
as
much
as
the
common
folk
daoud
wondered
there
seemed
to
be
fewer
prelates
in
red
and
purple
on
the
church
and
steps
when
he
looked
ugolini
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
turning
his
eyes
away
from
the
scene
in
the
piazza
de
verceuil
stared
right
at
the
victim
his
little
mouth
open
in
a
grin
showing
white
teeth
stood
stolidly
between
his
guards
his
arms
folded
he
did
not
seem
to
have
moved
or
changed
the
expression
on
his
face
since
daoud
first
saw
him
simon
de
gobignon
was
pale
as
parchment
and
even
as
daoud
watched
the
young
man
turned
and
hurried
into
the
cathedral
it
is
because
of
you
too
that
this
man
suffers
but
you
can
not
face
erculio
dancing
grimacing
comically
under
his
black
mustache
feinted
repeatedly
with
his
knife
at
the
condemned
man
groin
when
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
had
reached
a
crescendo
he
fell
upon
his
victim
and
sliced
away
testicles
and
penis
with
quick
strokes
the
heretic
gave
a
long
shivering
howl
of
agony
then
was
silent
the
little
man
tossed
the
bloody
organs
into
the
air
an
executioner
in
red
caught
them
and
threw
them
to
the
other
one
who
in
turn
hurled
them
into
the
crowd
hope
dozens
of
them
are
killed
in
the
scramble
god
forgive
me
for
the
pain
i
have
caused
this
the
two
men
in
red
untied
the
condemned
man
and
heaved
him
to
his
feet
his
face
and
body
so
running
with
blood
that
he
too
seemed
dressed
in
red
the
crowd
began
to
back
away
from
the
scaffold
and
daoud
felt
himself
irresistibly
carried
back
with
them
the
executioners
tied
the
limp
form
of
the
heretic
to
the
stake
jutting
up
from
the
center
of
the
platform
the
dwarf
scuttled
like
a
monkey
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
someone
handed
him
a
flaming
torch
he
danced
with
it
he
whirled
it
in
great
circles
around
his
head
and
daoud
heard
it
hissing
even
over
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
he
swung
the
flame
between
his
legs
and
leapt
over
it
he
threw
it
high
in
the
air
the
torch
spinning
under
the
thick
gray
clouds
that
hung
low
over
orvieto
erculio
neatly
caught
it
when
it
came
down
for
a
man
so
badly
deformed
his
agility
was
eerie
erculio
turned
toward
the
cathedral
holding
up
the
torch
daoud
followed
the
dwarf
gaze
and
saw
the
podesta
his
face
a
white
mask
give
a
wave
of
assent
spinning
on
his
heels
the
dwarf
scurried
to
the
ladder
scrambled
down
a
few
rungs
and
threw
the
torch
into
the
tinder
piled
under
the
platform
then
he
turned
and
leapt
out
into
space
the
other
two
executioners
had
left
the
platform
and
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
one
of
them
caught
erculio
and
swung
him
down
the
flames
shot
up
with
a
roar
a
red
and
gold
curtain
around
the
heretic
daoud
heard
no
more
cries
of
pain
perhaps
he
was
already
dead
of
his
wounds
daoud
prayed
to
god
that
it
be
so
the
smoke
did
not
rise
in
the
hot
moist
air
but
coiled
and
spread
around
the
scaffold
people
coughed
and
wiped
their
eyes
and
drew
back
farther
from
the
blaze
daoud
was
close
enough
to
feel
the
heat
and
on
such
a
sweltering
day
it
was
unbearable
but
now
he
discovered
he
could
move
the
crowd
was
dispersing
there
was
nothing
more
to
see
the
heretic
was
surely
dead
and
the
smoke
and
flames
hid
the
destruction
of
his
body
daoud
looked
up
at
the
cathedral
steps
there
were
no
red
or
purple
robes
there
and
the
papal
banner
was
gone
the
count
de
gobignon
had
reappeared
and
was
staring
at
the
fire
as
daoud
watched
the
count
stumbled
down
the
steps
his
arms
hanging
loosely
at
his
sides
daoud
turned
to
go
back
to
ugolini
well
messer
david
do
they
do
as
thorough
a
job
on
heretics
in
trebizond
daoud
path
was
blocked
by
a
man
in
a
scarlet
robe
from
beneath
the
wide
circular
brim
of
a
great
red
hat
the
long
dark
face
of
cardinal
de
verceuil
glowered
at
him
thick
red
tassels
hung
down
from
the
hat
all
around
the
cardinal
head
immediately
behind
de
verceuil
stood
two
attendants
one
held
high
a
white
banner
blazoned
with
a
red
cross
and
a
gold
flower
shape
in
two
of
the
quarters
the
other
man
a
sturdy
young
cleric
in
black
cassock
carried
a
long
golden
rod
that
curved
into
a
tight
spiral
at
the
top
that
was
called
a
crosier
daoud
recalled
and
was
the
cardinal
staff
of
office
behind
them
were
four
who
looked
hard
at
daoud
as
if
expecting
him
to
give
offense
to
their
master
daoud
wondered
if
the
cardinal
would
consider
having
him
killed
here
in
public
daoud
stared
at
him
through
the
smoky
air
measuring
him
looking
for
those
small
signs
of
tension
to
be
found
in
a
man
about
to
order
an
attack
the
man
seemed
too
relaxed
for
that
no
your
eminence
we
only
stone
our
heretics
to
death
de
verceuil
smiled
that
may
be
a
better
way
of
disposing
of
them
after
a
burning
the
unpleasant
thought
always
occurs
to
me
that
i
am
carrying
the
heretic
away
in
my
nostrils
and
lungs
sickened
inwardly
at
this
reminder
of
the
rancid
smell
that
had
come
from
the
heretic
pyre
daoud
smiled
at
the
grisly
jest
as
he
assumed
the
cardinal
expected
him
to
he
remained
silent
waiting
for
de
verceuil
to
reveal
the
reason
for
this
encounter
ordinarily
we
merely
burn
heretics
the
cardinal
went
on
we
had
this
man
tormented
first
because
he
threatened
our
guests
the
tartar
ambassadors
and
disturbed
a
service
in
the
cathedral
with
the
pope
himself
present
we
had
to
be
severe
with
him
assuredly
said
daoud
still
smiling
de
verceuil
italian
sounded
strange
to
him
he
must
be
speaking
it
with
a
french
accent
but
perhaps
since
you
seem
to
think
the
tartars
are
such
a
danger
to
christendom
said
de
verceuil
in
a
voice
that
was
lower
and
more
menacing
you
approve
of
what
that
man
did
he
gestured
toward
the
burning
scaffold
the
stake
and
whatever
was
left
of
the
body
bound
to
it
had
fallen
through
the
platform
into
the
pile
of
faggots
a
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
was
blowing
the
smoke
away
from
daoud
and
the
cardinal
for
which
daoud
thanked
god
i
came
here
today
to
see
justice
done
daoud
said
firmly
you
profess
the
greek
church
said
de
verceuil
eyeing
him
coldly
that
makes
you
a
heretic
yourself
the
behind
the
cardinal
shifted
restlessly
and
daoud
wondered
again
if
de
verceuil
meant
to
provoke
a
fight
leading
to
a
killing
or
perhaps
have
him
arrested
he
looked
past
de
verceuil
and
his
men
and
saw
that
some
curious
citizens
had
formed
a
circle
around
himself
and
the
cardinal
and
there
was
de
gobignon
standing
watchfully
only
a
short
distance
away
at
the
foot
of
the
cathedral
steps
was
his
sword
too
at
the
cardinal
command
if
you
are
concerned
about
justice
it
is
too
bad
you
chose
to
be
cardinal
ugolini
guest
during
your
stay
in
orvieto
de
verceuil
said
you
will
hear
only
a
corrupt
italian
point
of
view
in
his
household
praise
god
de
verceuil
was
not
pursuing
the
matter
of
daoud
heresy
daoud
shrugged
i
have
seen
what
devastation
the
tartars
do
your
eminence
with
respect
let
me
say
to
you
that
they
are
as
much
a
danger
to
your
country
france
as
to
italy
de
verceuil
essayed
what
he
may
have
thought
was
an
ingratiating
smile
but
his
small
mouth
made
him
look
sly
and
sour
i
invite
you
to
come
to
live
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
i
have
spoken
to
the
contessa
and
she
would
be
most
happy
to
receive
you
the
monaldeschi
are
the
wealthiest
family
in
orvieto
and
they
have
connections
with
other
great
families
in
the
papal
states
if
you
wish
to
find
good
customers
for
your
silks
and
spices
here
it
is
the
contessa
you
should
see
and
if
you
would
trade
with
france
perhaps
i
can
help
you
there
the
possibility
of
spending
some
days
and
nights
in
enemy
headquarters
was
intriguing
but
would
it
be
prudent
to
put
himself
into
de
verceuil
and
de
gobignon
hands
daoud
shook
his
head
with
what
he
hoped
was
a
regretful
smile
forgive
me
your
eminence
your
offer
of
the
contessa
hospitality
overwhelms
me
but
i
have
already
promised
to
remain
with
cardinal
ugolini
and
he
would
be
deeply
offended
if
i
were
to
leave
him
de
verceuil
glowered
ugolini
is
from
hohenstaufen
territory
the
monaldeschi
have
always
been
loyal
to
the
pope
and
have
great
influence
with
him
just
as
i
have
with
king
louis
of
france
and
his
brother
count
charles
come
to
us
and
when
you
go
back
to
your
own
land
you
will
be
a
wealthy
man
could
it
be
that
your
eminence
hopes
i
might
change
my
testimony
about
the
tartars
daoud
felt
close
to
laughter
as
the
cardinal
cheeks
reddened
de
verceuil
shot
back
could
it
be
that
your
enmity
to
the
tartars
is
more
important
to
you
than
your
profit
as
a
merchant
daoud
heart
beat
harder
that
was
too
close
to
the
mark
it
was
foolish
of
him
to
jest
with
a
man
who
had
the
power
to
condemn
him
and
his
friends
to
be
tortured
and
burned
like
that
poor
madman
i
regret
that
i
have
offended
your
eminence
he
said
i
have
seen
what
i
have
seen
and
i
am
honor
bound
to
speak
the
truth
and
profit
will
do
me
no
good
if
the
tartars
slaughter
us
all
you
are
ignorant
of
our
ways
de
verceuil
said
ominously
after
a
long
pause
during
which
daoud
felt
raindrops
strike
his
face
have
a
care
that
you
do
not
slip
into
pitfalls
you
can
not
possibly
foresee
first
de
verceuil
joked
then
he
threatened
then
he
offered
hospitality
then
he
threatened
again
he
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
how
to
deal
with
men
if
we
were
on
the
same
side
i
would
hate
him
what
a
trial
he
must
be
for
his
but
daoud
was
eager
to
get
away
without
creating
any
deeper
enmity
between
himself
and
the
cardinal
i
thank
you
again
for
your
offer
of
hospitality
your
eminence
even
if
i
can
not
come
to
live
at
the
monaldeschi

i
do
hope
to
meet
the
contessa
she
has
graciously
invited
cardinal
ugolini
to
her
reception
for

i
shall
accompany

you
are

said
de

angrily
you

being
closely
watched
he
turned
abruptly
and
strode
off
daoud
bowed
politely
to
his
scarlet
back
casting
ugly
looks
at
daoud
the
cardinal
men
followed
daoud
told
himself
that
it
would
be
wise
to
be
frightened
but
what
he
felt
was
more
a
profound
disdain
for
paulus
de
verceuil
a
man
of
religion
or
of
power
how
can
this
squawking
bird
in
red
plumage
compare
with
sheikh
saadi
and
the
imam
fayum
of
the
hashishiyya
the
rain
was
coming
down
harder
it
hissed
in
the
heap
of
wood
and
bones
a
movement
near
the
cathedral
steps
caught
daoud
eye
he
turned
and
saw
simon
de
gobignon
looking
at
him
why
was
he
alone
had
he
like
daoud
not
wanted
any
of
his
comrades
to
see
this
horror
how
infuriating
it
must
be
for
that
proud
young
frank
to
have
to
work
closely
with
a
man
like
cardinal
de
verceuil
the
cardinal
was
so
arrogant
so
overbearing
so
crude
as
to
turn
people
any
cause
he
might
support
no
matter
how
worthy
as
the
rain
fell
on
him
daoud
hardly
noticed
it
he
saw
a
new
plan
shimmering
like
a
mirage
on
the
horizon
of
his
mind
xxi
bonsoir
messire
i
have
not
seen
you
since
the
day
the
heretic
was
burned
i
trust
the
spectacle
did
not
disturb
you
simon
had
deliberately
addressed
david
of
trebizond
in
french
to
find
out
whether
the
trader
spoke
that
language
in
addition
to
greek
and
italian
he
might
be
from
the
other
side
of
the
earth
but
there
was
something
very
about
him
they
stood
facing
each
other
a
little
apart
from
the
crowd
gathered
in
the
sala
maggiore
the
great
hall
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
the
large
room
was
lit
by
hundreds
of
candles
four
musicians
in
a
distant
corner
sawed
away
energetically
at
vielles
of
different
sizes
held
between
their
knees
while
two
others
blew
on
hautboys
tables
were
piled
high
with
meat
and
pastry
along
the
sides
of
the
hall
servants
circulated
refilling
goblets
from
pitchers
of
wine
neither
simon
nor
david
was
holding
a
goblet
the
big
blond
man
who
had
not
been
looking
at
simon
turned
and
stared
at
him
simon
detected
a
pallor
under
his
tan
david
did
not
react
to
the
sound
of
french
like
a
man
who
had
heard
an
unfamiliar
language
he
looked
more
as
if
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
a
ghost
david
bowed
monseigneur
i
had
not
expected
to
be
addressed
in
french
simon
was
surprised
to
hear
in
david
northern
french
the
harsh
accents
of
the
english
channel
coast
where
did
you
learn
my
tongue
messire
simon
asked
david
shrugged
since
the
crusades
began
many
of
your
countrymen
have
passed
through
trebizond
many
crusaders
had
been
normans
simon
thought
it
made
sense
but
it
was
odd
that
this
man
david
who
claimed
to
be
a
greek
not
only
spoke
like
a
norman
but
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
big
blond
norman
knight
simon
had
seen
just
such
faces
square
with
long
straight
noses
and
cold
eyes
everywhere
in
normandy
and
in
england
when
he
had
accompanied
king
louis
on
a
state
visit
to
the
realm
of
his
vassal
king
henry
of
england
but
david
did
not
dress
like
a
norman
simon
noted
his
apparel
was
gaudy
in
the
extreme
he
wore
a
white
cap
with
a
feather
a
short
cape
particolored
hose
light
green
and
peach
and
boots
simon
who
in
emulation
of
king
louis
preferred
somber
colors
had
chosen
for
tonight
a
brown
velvet
singlet
and
maroon
hose
the
brightest
thing
about
him
was
the
jeweled
handle
of
his
prized
scimitar
i
hope
that
you
were
not
upset
by
the
bloody
execution
of
that
heretic
last
week
simon
said
once
again
oh
no
david
smiled
but
i
saw
you
there
and
you
seemed
to
be
wounds
how
true
that
is
was
simon
first
thought
he
had
held
himself
rigid
throughout
the
heretic
horrible
death
afraid
that
he
would
throw
up
but
how
disturbing
to
discover
that
this
greek
merchant
apparently
an
enemy
had
seen
right
through
simon
effort
to
appear
imperturbable
of
all
the
people
in
orvieto
this
man
was
the
last
simon
would
want
to
reveal
himself
to
he
cursed
himself
for
giving
david
such
a
perfect
opening
could
i
be
such
a
fool
and
i
thought
i
was
so
clever
addressing
him
in
simon
had
been
anticipating
his
next
encounter
with
david
with
a
mixture
of
eagerness
fear
and
anger
almost
as
if
it
were
to
be
a
battle
now
he
wished
he
had
stayed
away
from
the
man
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
devil
as
i
believe
a
christian
should
simon
said
did
you
not
there
was
a
baleful
look
in
david
eyes
as
if
he
hated
simon
for
his
answer
but
the
man
from
trebizond
only
shrugged
and
said
i
have
seen
much
blood
and
pain
in
my
life
a
broad
figure
in
a
white
robe
billowed
up
to
simon
and
david
simon
remembered
him
from
the
pope
council
fra
tomasso
the
distinguished
dominican
the
friar
belt
of
rosary
beads
rattled
as
he
walked
it
would
take
a
week
simon
thought
to
recite
all
the
our
fathers
and
hail
marys
that
encircled
fra
tomasso
count
i
trust
you
will
forgive
my
interrupting
you
i
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
messer
david
of
trebizond
but
i
have
wanted
to
speak
to
you
ever
since
you
arrived
in
orvieto
as
a
seminarian
i
studied
for
a
year
in
paris
under
your
uncle
hugues
de
gobignon
a
friar
of
great
renown
his
murder
was
such
a
tragedy
simon
felt
uneasy
at
reminiscence
about
the
uncle
who
was
not
really
his
uncle
as
he
chatted
with
fra
tomasso
his
eyes
roved
through
the
large
room
he
noticed
the
crowd
gathered
around
the
tartars
john
and
philip
who
were
seated
in
large
chairs
placed
near
a
crowned
swan
at
the
center
of
a
serving
table
he
saw
a
servant
pour
wine
into
a
silver
cup
john
held
out
to
him
more
of
that
wonderful
wine
of
montefiascone
beside
the
tartars
stood
a
woman
named
ana
from
the
land
of
the
bulgars
territory
now
ruled
by
the
tartars
anything
thought
simon
bitterly
to
keep
friar
mathieu
from
achieving
too
much
importance
de
verceuil
had
found
her
and
had
taken
her
along
as
interpreter
when
the
tartars
had
their
first
private
audience
with
the
pope
another
group
stood
around
the
seated
pope
urban
many
of
them
in
the
red
and
purple
of
cardinals
archbishops
and
bishops
there
was
de
verceuil
of
course
as
near
to
the
pope
as
he
could
get
the
vanity
as
usual
had
made
him
choose
layman
garb
a
tunic
of
silk
and
a
cape
of
aquamarine
satin
trimmed
with
squirrel
fur
and
between
two
prelates
shoulders
simon
could
just
make
out
the
top
of
cardinal
ugolini
fuzzy
gray
head
if
ugolini
was
here
had
his
niece
sophia
come
tonight
as
well
yes
there
she
was
halfway
across
the
hall
talking
to
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
the
pale
violet
of
sophia
gown
made
her
skin
look
darker
the
poets
always
sang
of
ladies
but
simon
found
her
dark
complexion
wondrously
attractive
she
had
let
her
embroidered
silk
shawl
fall
away
from
her
bare
shoulders
and
he
marveled
at
their
sweet
delicacy
under
her
gauze
veil
the
pearls
in
her
headdress
twinkled
like
stars
against
hair
that
was
black
as
night
excuse
me
fra
tomasso
messer
david
i
have
promised
to
deliver
a
most
urgent
message
to
the
contessa
fra
tomasso
in
the
middle
of
an
anecdote
about
friar
hugues
subtlety
as
an
inquisitor
gave
simon
leave
to
go
as
david
bowed
his
eyes
met
simon
and
his
look
was
at
once
both
knowing
and
bitter
he
too
was
a
guest
in
ugolini
house
thought
simon
was
he
too
attracted
to
sophia
who
would
not
be
as
simon
moved
toward
sophia
the
contessa
majordomo
strode
to
the
center
of
the
sala
maggiore
and
called
in
a
deep
voice
signori
e
madonne
tables
game
boards
and
cards
are
set
for
your
amusement
in
the
inner
galleria
then
simon
was
bowing
before
the
contessa
acutely
aware
of
sophia
standing
beside
her
he
kissed
the
old
lady
shiny
knuckles
hoping
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
kiss
sophia
hand
as
well
my
dear
boy
did
you
hear
the
announcement
do
you
enjoy
cards
or
backgammon
i
understand
your
pious
king
forbids
such
amusements
at
his
court
and
yet
our
holy
father
himself
loves
to
play
alii
she
saw
simon
staring
at
sophia
and
smiled
you
see
my
dear
the
contessa
said
to
sophia
does
this
splendid
young
frenchman
look
as
if
he
is
interested
in
cards
or
dice
or
in
you
enough
of
your
modesty
sophia
lowered
her
eyelids
and
blushed
how
beautiful
her
olive
complexion
was
tinted
with
rose
the
contessa
is
merciless
she
said
in
a
low
voice
merciless
the
contessa
cackled
my
dear
if
i
were
the
envious
sort
then
indeed
would
i
show
you
no
mercy
by
san
giorgio
i
would
have
you
poisoned
but
i
made
up
my
mind
many
many
years
ago
when
i
saw
my
looks
beginning
to
fade
that
i
had
to
choose
between
hating
the
beauty
of
other
women
or
enjoying
it
i
was
already
spending
all
my
hatred
on
the
odious
filippeschi
so
i
decided
that
when
i
saw
beautiful
women
i
would
rejoice
at
their
presence
in
the
world
and
delight
myself
by
remembering
my
own
youth
and
imagining
the
pleasures
they
must
be
experiencing
she
put
her
hand
on
simon
arm
what
do
you
think
count
simon
would
you
like
me
to
present
this
young
lady
to
you
a
thousand
thanks
contessa
said
simon
falling
into
the
extravagant
style
of
speaking
the
occasion
seemed
to
call
for
i
have
already
had
the
great
pleasure
of
meeting
madonna
sophia
at
her
uncle
mansion
the
contessa
nodded
ah
you
have
called
upon
cardinal
ugolini
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
i
would
have
told
you
to
if
you
had
not
done
it
on
your
own
she
turned
again
to
sophia
your
uncle
and
i
have
been
friends
ever
since
the
holy
father
moved
the
papal
household
to
orvieto
i
deeply
admire
and
respect
him
when
he
reads
the
stars
for
me
his
insights
and
predictions
are
remarkably
accurate
his
remedies
for
my
body
complaints
always
achieve
their
purpose
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
other
physicians
i
have
consulted
and
best
of
all
he
finds
time
for
a
lonely
old
lady
when
others
who
should
be
more
attentive
make
excuses
my
uncle
is
a
marvelous
man
your
signory
sophia
murmured
i
am
most
fortunate
to
be
his
niece
otherwise
i
could
never
hope
to
be
present
on
this
magnificent
occasion
to
meet
and
talk
with
you
and
to
be
waited
upon
by
this
handsome
cavaliere
the
contessa
finished
for
her
smiling
broadly
contessa
really
is
enjoying
simon
thought
the
old
lady
was
beaming
with
pleasure
sophia
turned
to
simon
i
am
most
pleased
to
see
you
again
count
her
eyes
seemed
to
shine
at
him
was
it
his
imagination
she
held
out
her
hand
his
whole
body
felt
more
intensely
alive
as
his
fingers
touched
hers
he
noticed
as
he
bent
over
her
hand
that
she
wore
one
ring
a
garnet
of
a
red
so
deep
as
to
be
almost
black
his
lips
touched
the
creamy
skin
of
the
back
of
her
hand
and
he
thought
he
felt
her
tremble
slightly
contessa
elvira
eyed
both
of
them
sighed
happily
and
said
i
think
it
is
time
for
me
to
find
someone
to
play
rota
with
perhaps
i
will
ask
your
uncle
to
tell
my
fortune
with
the
cards
he
reads
the
cards
as
well
as
he
reads
the
stars
they
bowed
as
she
moved
off
as
she
turned
her
back
simon
noticed
that
her
long
blue
velvet
gown
had
threadbare
patches
in
the
rear
she
was
so
old
and
so
powerful
simon
thought
that
such
things
did
not
matter
to
her
perhaps
it
was
a
favorite
gown
from
the
days
when
she
was
young
and
beautiful
like
sophia
but
he
doubted
that
she
had
ever
been
as
beautiful
as
sophia
may
i
bring
you
some
wine
or
something
to
eat
madonna
he
asked
sophia
thank
you
i
am
not
hungry
but
she
gestured
as
if
to
free
him
from
obligation
to
stand
with
her
perhaps
you
oh
no
i
am
quite
content
a
hand
of
cards
then
simon
hoped
she
would
see
that
he
was
making
it
his
responsibility
to
entertain
her
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
simon
felt
a
small
thrill
as
he
watched
her
bosom
rise
and
fall
under
the
fine
silk
of
her
violet
gown
what
i
would
really
like
count
would
be
a
stroll
in
the
garden
this
room
big
as
it
is
is
so
hot
and
crowded
and
even
though
it
is
september
this
evening
it
is
very
warm
do
you
not
think
so
very
warm
said
simon
delightedly
taking
her
arm
as
fra
tomasso
chatted
with
him
daoud
watched
de
gobignon
and
sophia
stroll
across
the
brightly
candlelit
hall
to
the
door
leading
to
the
inner
galleria
gobignon
spoke
to
me
in
the
language
of
my
sire
geoffrey
and
dame
evelyn
langmuir
he
knew
were
of
english
stock
but
daoud
father
had
once
told
him
that
all
the
english
nobility
spoke
french
tonight
was
the
first
time
since
daoud
landed
in
italy
that
he
had
heard
french
or
had
spoken
it
when
he
first
heard
himself
addressed
in
french
he
had
experienced
a
strange
and
frightening
sensation
as
if
his
dead
father
were
speaking
to
him
he
hated
de
gobignon
for
doing
that
to
him
i
hate
him
because
he
will
enjoy
the
woman
i
want
for
the
voice
of
fra
tomasso
faded
away
black
rage
filled
daoud
skull
deafening
and
blinding
him
he
pictured
sophia
naked
in
simon
de
gobignon
arms
and
his
body
trembled
and
when
he
did
become
sophia
lover
the
puppy
would
have
no
understanding
of
how
much
of
a
woman
he
was
possessing
to
him
she
would
be
the
sweet
sicilian
niece
of
a
cardinal
he
would
have
no
idea
of
the
woman
behind
that
mask
sophia
daoud
had
come
to
realize
had
known
suffering
and
loss
she
had
survived
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
world
and
she
had
risen
to
be
the
intimate
of
an
emperor
and
a
king
she
occupied
his
thoughts
daoud
sensed
with
some
uneasiness
far
more
often
than
did
blossoming
reed
back
in
el
kahira
simon
would
know
sophia
orfali
not
sophia
karaiannides
who
had
told
daoud
more
than
once
he
thought
with
a
grim
smile
how
much
she
hated
franks
she
would
make
a
fool
of
this
frank
fra
tomasso
was
rambling
on
about
the
one
sea
voyage
he
had
ever
taken
from
normandy
to
naples
one
would
think
going
around
the
continent
of
europe
like
that
would
take
much
longer
than
making
the
same
journey
overland
it
took
us
only
a
month
whereas
on
land
it
would
have
taken
at
least
three
the
sea
is
a
surface
on
land
one
is
traveling
over
a
surface
and
can
encounter
many
obstacles
and
a
carrier
pigeon
travels
much
faster
than
a
in
a
month
or
two
daoud
request
for
the
book
fra
tomasso
wanted
would
have
reached
baibars
and
a
few
months
after
that
if
baibars
could
obtain
the
book
the
friar
pudgy
hands
would
be
holding
it
listening
with
half
an
ear
daoud
looked
about
him
at
the
marble
pillars
that
ran
up
to
the
gilded
beams
of
the
ceiling
at
the
paintings
of
angels
and
saints
on
the
plaster
walls
at
the
fragments
of
old
roman
statues
that
stood
here
and
there
mostly
nude
torsos
idolatry
yes
but
beautifully
done
the
arts
of
the
christians
and
their
pagan
predecessors
were
not
altogether
as
barbaric
as
he
had
imagined
them
ugolini
suddenly
appeared
at
daoud
elbow
to
interrupt
his
thoughts
and
fra
tomasso
discourse
excuse
me
fra
tomasso
but
his
holiness
wishes
a
word
with
david
the
little
cardinal
eyes
darted
about
nervously
obviously
the
idea
of
a
conversation
between
daoud
and
the
pope
terrified
him
have
you
had
any
wine
said
ugolini
in
a
low
voice
as
they
crossed
the
room
to
where
urban
in
his
white
cassock
a
red
cloak
wrapped
around
his
shoulders
was
sitting
in
a
large
chair
the
spiritual
father
of
all
christians
was
dressed
heavily
for
such
a
warm
evening
daoud
thought
a
sign
of
ill
health
i
never
drink
wine
if
i
can
avoid
it
he
answered
ugolini
well
you
will
not
be
able
to
avoid
it
tonight
but
remember
you
have
no
head
for
it
daoud
was
about
to
retort
sharply
but
he
swallowed
the
impulse
such
unnecessary
advice
was
the
cardinal
way
of
allaying
his
terror
he
had
never
told
ugolini
about
the
training
in
resistance
to
drugs
he
had
undergone
with
sheikh
saadi
the
intoxicating
element
in
wine
could
affect
his
body
but
not
his
mind
this
is
a
very
dangerous
practice
sheikh
saadi
said
as
he
crouched
over
a
small
cooking
pot
suspended
on
a
tripod
above
a
low
fire
but
it
is
now
a
necessary
one
for
you
whatever
was
bubbling
in
the
pot
gave
off
a
strange
cloying
odor
that
daoud
found
frightening
and
seductive
at
the
same
time
they
were
in
the
inner
garden
of
saadi
small
house
in
the
oldest
quarter
of
el
kahira
daoud
half
sat
half
reclined
on
a
pile
of
cushions
he
leaned
back
and
saw
that
the
stars
were
fewer
and
the
sky
was
lighter
they
had
been
up
all
night
drinking
kaviyeh
the
liquid
saadi
was
brewing
now
smelled
nothing
like
kaviyeh
studying
the
simmering
liquid
saadi
seemed
satisfied
he
took
the
pot
off
the
fire
and
set
it
on
a
stone
still
on
his
knees
the
sheikh
swung
around
to
smile
at
daoud
in
the
firelight
his
face
was
many
shades
of
brown
and
black
but
his
beard
in
the
years
daoud
had
known
him
had
gone
from
gray
to
a
white
as
pure
as
the
wool
from
which
the
sufi
took
their
name
kneel
and
compose
your
mind
said
saadi
daoud
rose
from
a
sitting
position
to
his
knees
as
saadi
had
taught
him
and
as
he
had
practiced
for
many
years
he
visualized
his
mind
as
an
empty
pool
walled
with
tiles
a
fountain
sprang
up
in
the
center
of
the
pool
and
filled
it
slowly
with
clear
water
the
walls
of
the
pool
disappeared
and
there
was
nothing
but
clear
water
in
all
directions
stretching
away
to
infinity
saadi
seemed
to
know
when
daoud
had
reached
the
vision
of
infinity
and
he
spoke
again
think
of
god
daoud
saw
a
mountain
a
flame
the
sun
none
of
those
were
god
at
last
he
saw
the
blackness
of
the
spaces
between
the
stars
there
in
the
infinite
lightlessness
was
the
dwelling
place
of
god
like
the
black
stone
in
the
he
saw
the
darkness
that
veiled
god
and
he
locked
the
idea
of
god
in
his
mind
now
hold
the
thought
of
god
and
drink
saadi
held
a
silver
cup
to
his
lips
the
liquid
was
sweet
and
thick
he
swallowed
and
it
burned
the
lining
of
his
stomach
what
is
it
wine
mixed
with
hashish
daoud
was
shocked
spiritual
poison
saadi
himself
had
taught
him
that
and
now
saadi
had
tricked
him
into
sipping
the
vile
stuff
he
swayed
on
his
knees
feeling
dizzy
and
angry
saadi
held
up
a
warning
hand
remain
in
the
presence
of
god
he
will
protect
you
from
the
ill
effects
of
the
poison
this
is
the
practice
daoud
struggled
back
to
the
infinite
emptiness
that
hid
god
and
as
he
did
so
he
felt
his
mind
clear
the
drugs
were
spreading
like
tiny
flames
through
his
body
but
his
body
was
far
away
too
far
away
for
him
to
feel
the
heat
beside
him
saadi
said
everything
made
by
god
has
two
sides
a
useful
side
and
a
harmful
side
that
which
is
sometimes
a
poison
can
at
other
times
be
a
medicine
even
kaviyeh
which
we
drink
in
such
great
quantities
to
give
vigor
to
our
minds
can
be
a
poison
if
a
substance
is
taken
in
the
right
amount
on
the
right
occasion
with
the
right
attitude
it
can
unlock
doors
in
the
mind
our
lord
baibars
peace
be
upon
him
has
told
me
he
plans
to
send
you
to
the
hashishiyya
for
further
training
this
practice
will
help
you
to
gain
more
from
their
teachings
and
protect
you
from
being
corrupted
by
them
in
the
months
to
come
you
will
learn
to
take
in
every
kind
of
intoxicating
substance
and
keep
your
mind
free
this
is
not
magic
this
is
a
power
of
the
spirit
what
are
you
feeling
the
drug
devours
my
body
but
my
mind
is
in
the
presence
of
god
one
day
when
you
have
learned
all
you
can
from
the
hashishiyya
i
will
teach
you
the
secret
of
the
most
powerful
drug
of
all
soma
the
drug
that
is
made
by
the
mind
and
does
not
harm
the
body
at
all
head
for
wine
no
man
in
this
room
is
less
susceptible
to
de
verceuil
still
stood
beside
the
pope
his
gloomy
face
tightened
as
his
eyes
met
daoud
daoud
dropped
to
one
knee
before
the
pope
and
kissed
the
heavy
gold
ring
that
bore
a
tiny
engraving
of
a
man
in
a
boat
he
saw
that
the
old
man
was
wearing
white
satin
slippers
daoud
felt
so
dizzied
by
the
wonder
of
this
moment
that
the
tiled
floor
seemed
to
shake
under
him
he
held
in
his
hand
the
hand
of
the
pope
of
rome
successor
to
those
popes
who
had
sent
wave
after
wave
of
crusaders
crashing
against
the
walls
of
islam
whose
words
had
caused
the
deaths
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
the
faithful
he
daoud
ibn
abdallah
once
david
langmuir
had
penetrated
to
the
very
center
of
christian
power
there
ever
a
moment
like
this
before
in
all
of
time
when
a
servant
of
the
true
god
and
a
believer
in
the
word
of
the
prophet
held
the
hand
of
a
pope
in
his
messer
david
of
trebizond
the
venetians
have
just
raised
the
prices
of
saffron
curry
ginger
and
cardamom
said
the
pontiff
in
a
deep
voice
all
of
which
are
indispensable
to
my
kitchen
can
you
furnish
me
with
spices
more
cheaply
it
took
all
of
daoud
to
hold
in
a
burst
of
laughter
a
mameluke
comes
with
the
pope
and
what
do
they
discuss
the
price
of
spices
but
he
sobered
as
he
realized
how
useful
the
pope
interest
in
spices
could
be
to
him
as
a
purveyor
of
spices
to
the
papal
palace
his
position
in
orvieto
would
be
more
respected
and
more
secure
if
you
deal
with
us
holy
father
you
are
dealing
with
the
people
from
whom
the
venetians
get
those
spices
said
daoud
with
a
smile
as
he
stood
up
this
is
exactly
the
purpose
of
my
visit
good
good
have
cardinal
ugolini
arrange
an
appointment
for
you
with
my
steward
as
they
walked
away
daoud
said
softly
to
ugolini
would
it
not
be
amusing
if
the
sultan
of
cairo
were
to
furnish
the
spices
for
the
kitchen
the
irony
of
it
once
again
struck
him
as
funny
what
a
tale
for
the
bazaars
of
el
kahira
ugolini
stared
at
him
side
whiskers
quivering
not
amusing
at
all
is
right
to
be
afraid
i
saw
what
they
did
to
that
man
in
the
piazza
i
must
not
make
jokes
ugolini
needs
to
feel
he
can
rely
on
celino
emerged
from
the
circle
around
the
tartars
to
stand
before
daoud
at
daoud
insistence
the
sicilian
wore
garments
tailored
specially
for
this
evening
mostly
in
white
with
gold
embroidery
on
the
edges
of
his
cape
and
his
satin
tunic
what
are
the
tartars
doing
daoud
asked
sitting
and
drinking
and
mostly
talking
to
each
other
said
celino
there
is
a
crowd
of
curious
people
around
them
asking
them
questions
where
is
that
friar
mathieu
who
interprets
for
them
celino
shrugged
not
here
there
is
a
woman
from
some
eastern
country
translating
daoud
felt
a
tingle
of
excitement
like
a
hunter
who
had
sighted
prey
he
surveyed
the
room
simon
de
gobignon
his
right
hand
rot
and
had
already
left
with
sophia
as
daoud
and
sophia
had
planned
de
verceuil
still
hovered
near
the
pope
celino
you
heard
the
contessa
servant
announcing
games
in
the
next
room
see
if
you
can
draw
cardinal
de
verceuil
into
a
game
with
you
he
favors
backgammon
said
ugolini
all
the
french
dote
on
backgammon
said
celino
keep
him
entertained
said
daoud
to
entertain
de
verceuil
you
will
have
to
bore
yourself
said
ugolini
he
prefers
a
game
whose
outcome
is
never
in
doubt
daoud
and
ugolini
turned
to
the
serving
table
and
daoud
began
methodically
to
work
his
way
through
the
various
dishes
the
servants
had
set
out
for
her
guests
there
were
eels
steeped
in
a
strange
almost
sauce
there
were
small
tender
lobsters
and
large
meaty
ones
there
were
baby
birds
meant
to
be
eaten
bones
and
all
there
was
white
bread
and
there
were
fine
cakes
daoud
filled
his
stomach
forcing
himself
to
eat
even
those
foods
that
repelled
him
while
he
watched
celino
join
the
group
gathered
with
the
pope
daoud
used
his
dagger
to
cut
himself
a
slice
of
roast
veal
it
was
juicy
and
tender
and
he
cut
himself
another
the
meat
tasted
as
if
the
calf
had
been
killed
that
same
day
it
was
not
heavily
spiced
how
pleasant
to
dine
at
the
home
of
a
wealthy
woman
by
the
time
he
finished
his
fourth
slice
celino
and
de
verceuil
were
in
conversation
daoud
chatted
with
ugolini
about
astrology
in
the
cardinal
opinion
it
was
an
auspicious
night
and
that
assessment
of
the
heavens
helped
calm
the
bewhiskered
little
man
somewhat
it
being
harvest
season
the
contessa
tables
were
laden
with
fresh
fruits
daoud
enjoyed
apricots
and
grapes
and
sliced
open
an
orange
he
watched
celino
and
de
verceuil
move
toward
the
galleria
where
the
contessa
guests
were
playing
games
daoud
eyed
the
two
men
in
their
shimmering
robes
sitting
at
their
ease
in
the
sala
maggiore
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
curious
people
their
chief
guardians
de
verceuil
de
gobignon
and
friar
mathieu
were
all
elsewhere
daoud
as
was
customary
among
these
people
dipped
his
hands
in
a
basin
of
water
and
wiped
them
on
the
table
linen
then
he
began
to
push
his
way
into
the
ring
of
people
around
the
tartars
after
a
few
moments
he
found
himself
staring
down
at
them
they
were
laughing
together
over
some
private
joke
speaking
to
each
other
in
their
chirping
language
fra
tomasso
was
part
of
the
group
around
the
tartars
as
were
several
bishops
and
two
cardinals
a
stout
woman
stood
beside
john
the
older
of
the
two
she
wore
a
stiff
brocaded
blue
gown
and
her
hair
was
tightly
wrapped
in
a
net
of
gold
thread
madonna
ana
said
fra
tomasso
ask
messer
john
chagan
for
me
whether
the
city
called
karakorum
is
still
the
capital
of
the
tartar
empire
the
woman
turned
to
the
john
and
repeated
the
question
in
tartar
speech
john
bowed
and
smiled
to
fra
tomasso
and
spoke
to
the
woman
daoud
almost
felt
envy
at
the
sight
of
john
gorgeous
silk
robe
white
printed
with
flowers
having
massive
crimson
and
purple
heads
along
with
clusters
of
green
leaves
and
wispy
gold
clouds
he
gestured
as
he
spoke
and
his
hands
were
square
and
daoud
had
no
doubt
that
those
hands
had
taken
many
lives
messer
john
says
the
capital
of
their
empire
is
wherever
the
great
khan
makes
his
home
said
the
bulgarian
woman
in
a
flat
tone
it
used
to
be
karakorum
but
now
the
great
khan
is
building
a
city
in
the
land
of
cathay
the
city
is
called
xanadu
and
how
long
would
it
take
to
travel
from
baghdad
to
this
xanadu
fra
tomasso
asked
messer
john
says
for
a
party
of
christians
to
go
to
xanadu
from
baghdad
might
take
as
long
as
a
year
but
for
the
tartar
post
riders
it
takes
two
months
two
months
exclaimed
fra
tomasso
for
a
journey
that
would
take
ordinary
men
a
year
how
far
is
it
permit
me
to
answer
that
father
daoud
interrupted
because
the
tartars
do
not
know
your
system
of
measurements
the
roads
between
baghdad
and
the
great
cities
of
cathay
are
tortuous
and
vast
deserts
and
huge
mountains
stand
in
the
way
but
our
geographers
in
trebizond
estimate
that
a
caravan
going
over
that
route
would
travel
a
distance
of
three
thousand
leagues
and
the
tartars
cover
that
in
two
months
do
they
fly
the
fat
jowls
quivered
daoud
noticed
that
the
front
of
his
white
tunic
was
stained
with
what
appeared
to
be
spots
of
gravy
and
wine
daoud
turned
to
ana
kindly
ask
the
ambassadors
to
explain
to
fra
tomasso
how
their
riders
cover
such
a
distance
so
quickly
after
some
conversation
between
ana
and
the
tartars
fra
tomasso
had
his
answer
the
fastest
riders
and
horses
in
our
empire
carry
messages
in
relays
over
the
major
routes
a
message
never
stops
traveling
night
and
day
until
it
reaches
its
destination
at
night
runners
with
torches
guide
the
riders
the
italians
looked
awed
daoud
felt
unimpressed
the
mamelukes
also
had
post
riders
they
could
carry
a
message
from
el
kahira
to
damascus
in
four
days
how
intelligent
said
fra
tomasso
i
will
warrant
we
would
be
better
governed
here
in
europe
if
we
had
such
a
system
the
note
of
admiration
in
fra
tomasso
voice
made
daoud
uneasy
a
servant
passed
offering
cups
of
wine
on
a
tray
daoud
took
a
goblet
john
and
philip
raised
the
empty
cups
they
held
and
ana
refilled
them
from
a
pitcher
on
the
table
your
empire
is
so
vast
is
it
not
daoud
said
to
the
tartars
through
ana
that
even
messages
that
travel
swiftly
can
not
hold
it
together
philip
the
tartar
answered
that
smiling
fear
of
the
great
khan
holds
our
empire
together
ana
translated
is
the
great
khan
feared
even
in
the
lands
of
kaidu
khan
and
baraka
khan
daoud
asked
naming
the
two
rebels
who
did
not
recognize
hulagu
khan
brother
kublai
he
strove
for
a
tone
of
innocent
curiosity
the
faces
of
the
two
tartars
remained
expressionless
but
daoud
schooled
by
his
hashishiyya
masters
to
notice
signs
of
emotion
in
the
most
guarded
of
men
observed
the
flush
creeping
into
their
brown
cheeks
the
slight
quickening
of
their
breathing
and
the
twitching
of
their
fingers
until
he
asked
his
disturbing
question
they
had
answered
daoud
readily
almost
casually
as
they
would
any
of
the
other
guests
now
in
silence
they
studied
him
waiting
for
them
to
finish
their
inspection
daoud
held
out
his
wine
cup
to
ana
who
filled
it
from
the
pitcher
on
the
table
the
pitcher
was
almost
empty
and
she
signaled
to
a
servant
to
bring
another
john
chagan
said
and
ana
translated
i
do
not
believe
we
have
had
the
honor
of
being
presented
to
you
messere
daoud
turned
to
fra
tomasso
who
was
following
the
conversation
closely
will
you
be
good
enough
to
introduce
us
your
reverence
any
opportunity
to
involve
himself
with
the
dominican
philosopher
could
be
useful
while
fra
tomasso
presented
him
and
ana
translated
daoud
stared
at
the
tartars
with
deliberate
challenge
draining
his
wine
cup
philip
caught
the
meaning
of
the
gesture
at
once
and
drank
deep
from
his
silver
goblet
as
well
john
followed
suit
trebizond
said
john
not
far
from
our
borders
daoud
had
wondered
whether
any
of
the
tartars
sponsors
had
told
them
of
david
of
trebizond
and
his
testimony
against
them
at
the
pope
council
your
khan
hulagu
has
already
pressed
our
emperor
for
tribute
and
submission
said
daoud
refilling
his
cup
he
tensed
wondering
whether
he
was
pushing
the
tartars
too
far
too
quickly
if
they
grew
insulted
and
refused
to
speak
to
him
he
would
have
accomplished
nothing
he
sipped
his
wine
before
tonight
the
taste
of
wine
had
always
puckered
his
mouth
and
he
had
had
to
force
himself
to
drink
it
but
this
wine
was
as
sweet
as
spring
water
john
and
philip
seemed
to
enjoy
it
too
they
quickly
emptied
and
refilled
their
cups
daoud
watched
the
two
tartars
closely
as
ana
translated
his
last
remark
a
suggestion
of
amusement
played
about
the
eyes
of
the
john
chagan
john
he
guessed
must
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
old
enough
to
have
ridden
under
the
founder
of
the
tartar
empire
the
ruler
called
genghis
khan
philip
whose
face
was
fuller
was
probably
half
john
age
we
are
at
peace
with
trebizond
said
john
we
have
exchanged
ambassadors
he
took
a
gulp
of
wine
and
emitted
a
deeply
satisfied
sigh
how
can
a
people
who
believe
that
the
whole
world
belongs
to
them
remain
long
at
peace
with
anyone
asked
daoud
he
watched
the
woman
ana
if
she
were
to
dull
the
edge
of
what
he
said
in
translating
it
his
effort
would
fail
but
she
seemed
unmoved
by
what
he
said
and
repeated
it
quickly
in
the
tartar
tongue
but
now
the
two
tartars
were
glaring
at
him
philip
in
open
fury
john
with
a
cold
hostility
as
if
daoud
were
an
insect
that
needed
to
be
stepped
on
how
much
farther
could
he
press
them
he
wondered
as
he
took
another
sip
of
wine
and
stared
back
xxii
sophia
felt
cooler
here
in
the
atrium
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
than
she
had
in
the
sala
maggiore
a
breeze
blew
through
the
archway
that
led
to
the
rear
courtyard
of
the
palace
but
it
did
not
blow
hard
enough
to
keep
the
mosquitoes
away
nor
did
the
essence
of
lemon
in
the
wax
candles
in
lanterns
that
lit
the
atrium
repel
the
whining
little
pests
though
it
scented
the
air
pleasantly
mingling
with
the
sachet
of
dried
orange
cuttings
she
wore
under
her
gown
between
her
breasts
to
protect
herself
from
the
insects
sophia
wrapped
her
shawl
around
her
bare
shoulders
and
drew
her
gauze
veil
over
her
face
she
thought
it
made
her
look
more
mysteriously
attractive
as
well
perhaps
that
was
the
real
reason
muslim
women
were
willing
to
wear
veils
she
wondered
whether
daoud
had
a
lover
or
a
wife
back
in
cairo
probably
half
a
dozen
of
each
she
glanced
over
at
the
young
french
count
walking
solemnly
beside
her
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
the
mosquitoes
did
not
seem
to
bother
him
or
at
least
he
did
not
slap
at
them
well
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
sharp
features
dark
hair
and
pale
skin
she
imagined
the
blood
of
such
a
man
might
taste
sour
and
not
draw
mosquitoes
he
was
good
to
look
at
surely
but
there
was
a
bitterness
about
him
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
not
a
happy
man
perhaps
i
should
not
walk
alone
with
you
like
this
madonna
he
said
actually
his
italian
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
understand
she
had
criticized
it
only
to
throw
him
off
balance
when
she
first
met
him
probably
her
french
was
no
better
than
his
italian
but
he
had
been
too
gallant
to
say
so
do
you
fear
for
your
virtue
your
signory
she
asked
lightly
he
smiled
and
even
in
the
dim
lantern
light
his
face
took
on
a
sweetness
that
was
quite
at
odds
with
his
previous
solemn
appearance
my
virtue
such
as
it
is
is
yours
to
dispose
madonna
she
felt
warmed
within
by
his
words
and
the
beauty
of
his
smile
they
paused
by
a
square
pool
in
the
center
of
the
atrium
he
bent
and
dipped
his
cupped
hands
then
held
them
out
to
her
filled
with
water
the
contessa
has
told
me
that
the
pool
is
fed
by
an
underground
spring
he
said
the
water
is
the
purest
i
have
ever
tasted
try
it
do
the
monaldeschi
keep
fish
in
it
she
hesitated
thinking
of
cardinal
ugolini
vivarium
no
this
is
their
drinking
water
taste
it
she
lifted
her
veil
and
lowered
her
mouth
into
his
hands
the
water
was
pure
and
sweet
just
as
he
had
said
as
a
lover
she
thought
simon
would
be
like
this
water
sweet
not
bitter
the
water
was
gone
and
her
lips
touched
his
palm
deliberately
she
paused
a
moment
before
drawing
back
he
moved
toward
her
holding
out
both
hands
but
she
turned
as
if
she
had
not
noticed
and
took
a
step
away
from
him
on
the
gravel
dropping
the
gauze
veil
before
her
face
you
have
not
explained
to
me
why
you
think
you
should
not
be
walking
alone
with
me
your
signory
ah
well
he
had
to
gather
his
thoughts
she
saw
such
a
had
a
emperor
and
a
splendid
young
king
as
lovers
she
now
felt
herself
in
love
with
a
strange
saracen
warrior
a
mameluke
who
was
subtle
ruthless
kindly
mysterious
daring
so
many
things
it
dizzied
her
to
think
about
him
but
simon
simplicity
brought
back
memories
of
alexis
the
boy
she
had
loved
when
she
herself
was
as
innocent
as
simon
now
appeared
to
be
simon
said
because
your
uncle
leads
the
faction
here
in
orvieto
that
opposes
the
tartars
and
because
the
chief
witness
against
them
has
been
the
merchant
david
who
dwells
as
you
do
in
the
cardinal
house
hates
she
heard
it
in
his
voice
what
has
that
to
do
with
you
and
me
simon
this
was
the
right
moment
she
thought
to
call
him
by
his
name
i
care
nothing
for
affairs
of
state
in
siracusa
we
have
better
things
to
do
with
our
time
than
worry
about
alliances
and
wars
everyone
will
be
affected
by
what
happens
here
concerning
the
tartars
he
said
even
the
people
of
siracusa
she
tried
to
look
impressed
if
think
it
would
be
so
good
for
christians
and
tartars
to
fight
together
against
the
saracens
i
can
not
imagine
why
my
uncle
is
against
it
i
do
not
understand
that
either
said
simon
or
why
he
brought
this
man
david
to
orvieto
to
cause
so
much
trouble
she
shrugged
i
hardly
ever
see
the
man
from
trebizond
my
mansion
is
so
big
people
can
come
and
go
without
ever
meeting
she
hoped
the
suggestion
would
take
root
it
was
vital
for
him
to
think
there
was
no
connection
between
david
and
herself
this
is
a
opportunity
for
us
to
rescue
the
holy
land
he
said
perhaps
i
can
help
you
she
said
would
you
his
face
brightened
i
could
try
to
find
out
why
my
uncle
opposes
your
cause
if
you
will
tell
me
why
we
christians
ally
ourselves
with
the
tartars
i
will
repeat
your
reasons
to
him
i
will
not
say
they
came
from
you
hearing
the
arguments
in
private
coming
from
a
loved
niece
he
might
open
his
mind
to
them
simon
eyes
opened
wide
in
amazement
you
would
do
all
that
but
why
are
you
so
willing
to
help
me
madonna
when
your
uncle
is
so
opposed
to
my
cause
because
i
would
like
she
hesitated
just
for
a
breath
then
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
you
she
was
on
dangerous
ground
the
tradition
of
courtly
love
in
which
he
had
doubtless
been
reared
called
for
the
woman
to
be
aloof
and
for
the
man
to
beg
for
meetings
but
daoud
had
told
her
she
did
not
have
the
time
to
allow
this
inexperienced
young
man
to
proceed
at
his
own
pace
he
appeared
overwhelmed
with
happiness
her
answer
had
just
the
effect
she
had
hoped
for
but
you
must
help
she
said
with
the
satisfied
feeling
that
she
was
now
closing
the
trap
you
must
teach
me
what
to
say
to
my
uncle
as
i
said
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
come
to
me
without
anyone
knowing
will
you
visit
me
when
i
send
for
you
oh
madonna
command
me
his
eyes
were
huge
now
and
his
smile
was
like
a
full
moon
shining
into
the
atrium
i
command
you
to
come
over
here
with
me
she
said
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
as
a
light
rain
began
to
fall
led
him
into
a
shadowy
corner
of
the
open
gallery
that
surrounded
the
garden
he
pressed
her
back
against
a
column
she
lifted
her
veil
and
let
him
kiss
her
fiercely
as
the
rain
pattered
down
on
the
lemon
trees
she
became
entirely
sophia
orfali
and
tasted
his
kisses
hungrily
dizzy
with
joy
at
having
won
the
love
of
a
splendid
young
nobleman
of
course
i
fought
in
russia
and
poland
ana
said
speaking
for
john
chagan
while
the
old
tartar
threw
out
his
arms
in
a
sweeping
gesture
everyone
went
daoud
smiled
and
nodded
leaning
back
in
the
chair
someone
had
brought
for
him
his
right
leg
crossed
over
the
left
he
tried
to
look
relaxed
though
his
heart
was
beating
fast
he
felt
like
a
man
climbing
a
cliff
whose
slightest
misstep
might
bring
a
disastrous
fall
he
was
feeling
the
effects
of
the
a
hissing
sound
in
his
ears
a
numbness
in
his
face
a
difficulty
focusing
his
eyes
an
urge
difficult
to
suppress
to
splash
the
contents
of
his
wine
cup
in
ugly
face
but
his
mind
was
untouched
he
knew
and
that
meant
he
was
under
better
control
than
these
two
savages
whom
he
had
drawn
into
telling
stories
of
their
wars
was
that
your
first
campaign
he
asked
john
made
a
lengthy
speech
in
answer
to
daoud
question
striking
his
chest
many
times
and
reaching
for
more
wine
finally
ana
translated
she
seemed
made
of
iron
this
bulgarian
woman
she
did
not
drink
she
did
not
get
tired
she
did
not
even
sit
down
and
she
did
not
seem
to
care
what
anyone
said
john
assured
david
that
as
a
young
man
he
had
participated
in
the
destruction
of
the
khwarezmian
empire
khwarezmia
daoud
remembered
a
turkish
nation
was
the
first
muslim
land
to
fall
to
the
tartars
he
glanced
around
and
saw
that
ugolini
and
a
number
of
other
cardinals
both
french
and
italian
had
gathered
to
listen
the
contessa
was
there
too
and
even
as
daoud
looked
the
circle
parted
for
pope
urban
two
servants
hurried
over
carrying
a
chair
for
him
and
he
sat
down
heavily
the
tartars
had
turned
khwarezmia
into
a
desert
but
this
audience
would
not
care
overmuch
about
that
daoud
wondered
if
he
could
turn
the
conversation
back
to
what
they
had
done
in
christian
lands
what
about
moscow
he
said
his
voice
sounded
to
him
as
if
his
ears
were
stuffed
with
cotton
he
worried
that
john
might
realize
that
he
was
being
led
to
talk
about
what
he
had
done
against
christians
moscow
said
john
that
was
much
later
strange
how
john
voice
seemed
to
be
coming
from
ana
lips
i
was
in
command
of
my
own
tuman
there
ten
thousand
men
under
our
great
commander
subotai
baghadur
ah
yes
we
killed
off
all
the
people
of
moscow
daoud
felt
like
leaping
from
his
chair
just
what
he
had
hoped
to
hear
he
made
himself
slump
down
still
more
and
look
sleepier
i
never
could
understand
how
it
is
possible
to
kill
off
the
population
of
a
whole
city
he
said
affecting
a
tone
of
cool
curiosity
it
must
take
days
and
be
very
tiring
philip
uzbek
laughed
when
this
was
translated
clearly
he
thought
it
a
foolish
remark
his
round
flat
face
reminded
daoud
of
kassar
and
with
the
thought
a
red
mist
of
rage
passed
before
daoud
eyes
john
responded
to
daoud
remark
not
at
all
tiring
we
had
five
tumans
at
moscow
there
were
about
fifty
thousand
people
living
in
the
city
and
many
had
died
in
the
siege
subotai
gave
the
honor
of
the
killing
to
the
most
valorous
tuman
which
happened
to
be
mine
we
just
divided
them
up
each
of
us
took
about
five
of
them
you
can
kill
five
people
in
no
time
it
is
not
like
fighting
some
we
shot
with
arrows
others
we
cut
their
heads
off
the
women
are
especially
easy
you
just
pull
their
hair
to
stretch
their
necks
so
the
sword
will
go
through
easier
and
chop
ana
imperturbable
even
now
repeated
the
slicing
gesture
john
made
with
his
hand
the
children
run
away
sometimes
and
you
have
to
chase
them
john
chuckled
it
is
best
to
use
arrows
on
them
but
the
adults
are
so
terrified
they
just
stand
there
daoud
looked
again
at
the
circle
around
them
several
people
looked
a
bit
sick
the
mouth
of
the
elderly
contessa
hung
open
revealing
the
absence
of
two
or
three
lower
front
teeth
pope
urban
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
face
expressionless
driven
by
his
growing
hatred
for
the
tartars
he
pressed
them
to
reveal
more
of
themselves
he
should
be
pleased
he
thought
at
this
much
success
but
he
wanted
to
destroy
them
utterly
you
do
not
mind
killing
children
he
asked
john
seemed
puzzled
by
the
question
what
else
could
we
do
with
them
with
their
parents
dead
they
would
only
starve
to
death
or
if
they
lived
they
would
grow
up
hating
us
and
we
would
have
to
fight
them
could
make
slaves
of
said
a
voice
inside
daoud
and
the
red
mist
swelled
into
a
cloud
of
fury
billowing
up
inside
him
he
had
to
sit
motionless
his
fist
clenched
on
the
stem
of
his
silver
goblet
waiting
for
the
feeling
to
pass
thank
god
for
saadi
teaching
it
was
painful
to
look
directly
with
the
inner
eye
at
the
disorientation
of
his
senses
and
at
the
anger
surging
through
his
body
but
it
saved
him
from
any
fatal
mistake
philip
said
at
baghdad
i
found
a
whole
house
full
of
babies
maybe
thirty
or
forty
i
slit
all
of
their
throats
their
mothers
were
dead
already
i
suppose
they
left
the
babies
behind
when
they
went
out
of
the
city
to
be
executed
hoping
they
would
survive
but
with
no
one
to
suckle
them
the
babies
would
have
starved
to
death
killing
them
was
an
act
of
mercy
remembering
what
he
had
seen
of
baghdad
daoud
felt
his
rage
grow
cold
and
towering
as
the
mountains
of
the
roof
of
the
world
those
were
his
muslim
people
he
wanted
to
draw
the
dagger
at
his
belt
and
slash
the
throats
of
the
two
gloating
drunken
savages
before
him
he
bit
down
hard
on
his
lower
lip
to
keep
himself
under
control
when
we
shot
people
with
arrows
said
john
we
went
around
and
pulled
the
arrows
out
of
the
bodies
afterward
so
we
could
use
them
again
we
do
not
waste
anything
is
trying
to
show
how
admirable
they
daoud
watched
the
stout
bulgarian
woman
ana
speak
john
words
in
italian
still
expressionless
still
standing
motionless
but
to
his
surprise
he
saw
rivulets
of
tears
on
her
round
cheeks
she
had
been
in
bulgaria
when
the
tartars
came
he
thought
she
had
seen
what
christians
called
the
fury
of
the
tartars
she
must
have
been
among
the
survivors
who
submitted
to
their
rule
but
she
had
not
forgotten
perhaps
translating
john
and
philip
words
exactly
as
they
spoke
them
was
her
way
of
taking
revenge
john
held
out
his
goblet
and
ana
refilled
it
he
laughed
softly
at
nothing
in
particular
and
drank
more
but
why
do
this
to
city
after
city
daoud
asked
when
we
invade
a
kingdom
the
rulers
and
people
are
determined
to
resist
us
said
john
to
fight
them
might
cost
us
the
lives
of
thousands
of
our
warriors
but
when
we
wipe
out
one
or
two
whole
cities
they
become
terrified
they
lose
their
will
to
fight
and
surrender
quickly
it
saves
many
lives
on
both
sides
philip
grinned
broadly
it
shows
that
we
have
power
like
no
other
people
on
earth
he
shook
both
fists
we
can
level
whole
cities
this
teaches
all
men
that
eternal
heaven
has
given
us
dominion
over
the
whole
earth
daoud
heard
whispers
from
the
people
around
him
and
pope
urban
coughed
softly
daoud
could
hardly
believe
his
luck
not
luck
he
thought
god
had
delivered
the
tartars
into
his
hands
the
whole
earth
said
daoud
even
europe
even
the
christian
lands
philip
threw
out
his
arms
expansively
the
whole
earth
all
there
is
every
corner
daoud
earlier
rage
had
subsided
instead
he
felt
wild
triumph
and
he
had
to
grip
the
seat
of
his
chair
to
hold
himself
down
daoud
heard
cardinal
ugolini
declare
you
see
exactly
what
we
have
been
saying
you
say
eternal
heaven
gives
you
the
right
to
rule
the
world
daoud
asked
do
you
mean
god
john
shrugged
eternal
heaven
is
what
our
ancestors
called
him
now
that
we
are
christians
we
call
him
god
fra
tomasso
suddenly
cut
in
but
surely
you
realize
that
the
sky
or
whatever
you
worshiped
before
you
became
christians
is
not
the
true
god
after
ana
translated
this
john
questioned
her
squinting
at
the
dominican
as
he
did
so
apparently
wanting
to
make
sure
of
fra
meaning
would
god
have
neglected
us
before
christian
priests
found
their
way
to
our
land
john
said
through
ana
of
course
he
has
spoken
to
us
has
he
not
made
us
the
most
powerful
people
on
earth
perhaps
he
has
done
so
in
order
that
you
might
hear
his
word
said
fra
tomasso
i
am
not
a
priest
john
said
with
a
sudden
broad
grin
but
we
have
the
highest
priests
of
the
christian
faith
here
tonight
let
them
say
whether
eternal
heaven
and
god
are
the
same
he
bowed
his
round
head
and
held
out
his
hand
in
invitation
a
silence
fell
the
little
band
of
musicians
playing
vielles
and
hautboys
in
one
corner
of
the
room
suddenly
sounded
very
loud
daoud
turned
to
look
once
again
at
the
audience
his
dialogue
with
the
tartars
had
drawn
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
fra
tomasso
at
least
half
a
dozen
cardinals
and
pope
urban
himself
their
figures
swam
before
daoud
and
he
knew
the
wine
was
overcoming
him
bodily
at
any
rate
the
faces
of
the
christian
leaders
looked
very
grave
though
and
the
grimmer
they
looked
the
more
pleased
he
felt
fra
tomasso
especially
he
hoped
had
heard
enough
to
sway
him
he
turned
back
to
the
tartars
they
too
seemed
aware
of
the
uneasy
unhappy
silence
the
pope
appeared
not
to
feel
that
john
inquiry
deserved
an
answer
the
older
tartar
smile
faded
and
he
carefully
set
down
his
wine
cup
philip
eyes
darted
this
way
and
that
john
said
something
to
philip
in
a
low
voice
probably
a
warning
to
say
no
more
john
had
the
look
of
a
water
buffalo
beset
by
village
curs
his
eyes
smoldering
his
head
turning
from
side
to
side
daoud
sensed
because
he
often
felt
the
same
way
himself
how
alone
john
must
feel
surrounded
by
enemies
does
not
have
ten
thousand
warriors
at
his
back
daoud
heard
a
stir
behind
him
and
turned
to
see
the
crowd
parting
to
let
pope
urban
leave
the
broad
back
of
fra
tomasso
following
close
behind
him
a
in
black
was
coming
from
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
outer
mantle
for
the
pope
the
contessa
rustled
after
urban
who
turned
and
offered
her
his
hand
to
kiss
as
the
aged
hostess
knelt
unsteadily
before
urban
daoud
rejoiced
at
the
troubled
abstracted
expression
in
the
pope
aged
eyes
daoud
heaved
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
stood
swaying
for
a
moment
his
eyes
would
not
focus
and
he
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
then
he
saw
john
chagan
giving
him
a
look
as
piercing
as
a
tartar
lance
now
daoud
saw
john
understood
what
he
had
done
to
him
as
for
philip
he
sat
slumped
only
half
awake
his
empty
wine
cup
held
loosely
the
stout
ana
stood
impassive
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
as
if
content
to
remain
there
all
night
her
cheeks
were
now
dry
defeated
your
army
at
the
well
of
goliath
tartar
and
now
i
have
defeated
you
at
monsters
it
was
the
voice
of
the
contessa
and
daoud
turned
to
see
her
losing
his
balance
and
having
to
put
out
a
foot
to
catch
himself
he
saw
de
verceuil
as
well
coming
across
the
hall
almost
at
a
run
just
ahead
of
the
contessa
his
aquamarine
cloak
flying
his
eyes
were
wide
his
little
mouth
tight
with
fury
the
contessa
looking
just
as
angry
was
hurrying
to
keep
up
with
him
and
tell
him
what
she
thought
you
have
brought
monsters
into
my
house
everything
bad
i
have
heard
about
them
they
have
now
admitted
in
a
year
or
two
they
will
be
at
the
gates
of
rome
they
are
the
huns
all
over
again
her
eyes
were
huge
and
her
nostrils
flared
with
passion
daoud
suppressed
an
urge
to
laugh
aloud
with
delight
de
verceuil
checked
his
rush
to
get
to
his
tartar
charges
and
turned
to
the
contessa
your
signory
i
beg
you
to
understand
they
have
been
drinking
they
did
not
know
what
they
were
saying
old
boasting
exaggerated
tales
of
their
exploits
the
tartars
are
given
to
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
not
exaggerated
the
old
lady
cried
shrilly
we
have
heard
tales
before
of
their
massacres
now
i
have
heard
the
same
from
their
own
lips
these
very
men
whom
i
have
welcomed
into
my
house
their
hands
drip
with
the
blood
of
children
one
of
them
told
how
he
slit
the
throats
of
forty
babies
and
they
are
proud
of
what
they
have
done
they
feel
no
remorse
old
soldiers
boasting
old
soldiers
boast
of
overcoming
strong
enemies
these
these
bestioni
gloat
over
the
slaughter
of
the
helpless
perhaps
they
look
at
my
palazzo
and
think
that
one
day
it
will
be
theirs
and
you
have
brought
them
under
my
roof
donna
elvira
de
verceuil
pleaded
let
me
find
out
the
truth
about
what
has
been
happening
here
daoud
heartbeat
quickened
he
should
slip
away
now
drunk
as
he
was
he
would
be
too
vulnerable
to
de
verceuil
the
french
cardinal
was
shouting
at
the
bulgarian
woman
john
the
tartar
was
smiling
as
if
de
verceuil
appearance
were
enough
in
itself
to
extricate
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
speech
fleshy
chin
rested
on
his
chest
and
his
eyes
were
fast
shut
something
white
moved
in
the
corner
of
daoud
eye
and
he
looked
toward
the
doorway
leading
to
the
inner
galleria
where
the
gaming
had
been
going
on
lorenzo
was
just
sauntering
out
he
was
all
the
way
across
the
room
and
daoud
vision
was
too
blurred
to
see
his
expression
but
he
was
probably
smiling
he
walked
closer
seeming
to
be
looking
at
daoud
for
a
signal
but
daoud
could
think
of
none
to
send
done
lorenzo
how
badly
i
wonder
did
you
have
to
play
at
backgammon
to
keep
de
verceuil
occupied
all
this
time
how
could
i
stop
them
from
speaking
your
eminence
ana
was
protesting
i
am
here
only
to
translate
what
they
say
this
man
came
up
to
talk
to
them
and
i
simply
repeated
what
they
said
to
him
and
what
he
said
back
to
them
what
man
de
verceuil
asked
the
question
almost
in
a
whisper
and
ana
eyes
turned
toward
daoud
late
now
i
must
face
you
de
verceuil
said
in
the
same
low
voice
daoud
swayed
and
it
came
to
him
at
once
how
best
to
respond
he
would
pretend
to
be
too
drunk
to
understand
what
was
happening
you
provoked
these
indiscretions
the
cardinal
ground
out
the
jeweled
cross
hanging
on
his
chest
winked
and
glittered
as
it
rose
and
fell
with
his
deep
breathing
daoud
put
out
a
hand
to
grasp
the
back
of
his
chair
smiling
at
the
cardinal
he
leaned
heavily
on
the
chair
and
circled
it
methodically
he
sat
down
heavily
on
the
arm
almost
tipping
the
chair
over
then
he
slid
into
the
seat
with
a
thump
he
looked
up
at
de
verceuil
and
said
what
the
cardinal
hands
they
were
very
large
daoud
saw
clenched
and
unclenched
wishes
he
could
strangle
why
have
you
tried
to
embarrass
these
ambassadors
de
verceuil
demanded
his
voice
was
a
good
deal
louder
now
daoud
let
his
head
loll
he
caught
sight
of
lorenzo
again
the
sicilian
was
much
closer
daoud
shook
his
head
ever
so
slightly
and
jerked
his
chin
he
let
his
head
fall
forward
de
verceuil
moved
closer
raising
his
eyes
while
keeping
his
head
lowered
daoud
found
himself
staring
at
the
cardinal
belt
buckle
a
gold
medallion
displaying
an
angel
head
with
wings
growing
out
of
its
curly
hair
i
have
embarrassed
no
one
daoud
mumbled
thickly
i
know
john
and
philip
people
they
are
our
neighbors
he
laughed
and
let
the
laugh
go
on
too
long
we
talked
about
things
everybody
knows
he
felt
those
big
hands
seize
the
front
of
his
tunic
and
jerk
him
to
his
feet
de
verceuil
flushed
face
was
less
than
a
hand
width
from
his
own
the
cardinal
eyes
were
huge
and
dark
daoud
felt
his
muscles
bunch
and
he
forced
them
to
relax
he
felt
fear
not
fear
of
de
verceuil
whom
he
could
easily
kill
but
fear
of
losing
control
of
himself
of
letting
the
face
of
steel
show
through
the
mask
of
clay
such
a
revelation
could
put
an
end
to
his
mission
who
the
devil
are
you
what
are
you
doing
in
orvieto
answer
me
de
verceuil
shook
daoud
violently
daoud
head
rocked
back
and
forth
and
he
saw
two
faces
of
de
verceuil
had
there
been
no
wine
in
his
blood
it
would
have
been
easier
for
daoud
to
control
his
fear
and
his
anger
he
knew
he
must
play
at
being
a
merchant
who
would
be
terrified
at
having
provoked
the
wrath
of
a
prince
of
the
church
but
as
it
was
he
felt
himself
caught
up
in
a
whirlwind
of
rage
and
his
hands
came
up
going
for
the
cardinal
throat
just
in
time
he
changed
the
move
into
a
cringing
gesture
i
could
have
you
killed
de
verceuil
shouted
and
i
will
if
you
do
not
answer
me
stop
the
small
body
of
cardinal
ugolini
was
beside
them
almost
between
them
david
of
trebizond
is
my
guest
daoud
glanced
down
at
ugolini
and
saw
that
he
was
trembling
violently
thinks
i
might
do
something
that
would
expose
us
trebizond
de
verceuil
spat
the
word
this
man
is
a
damned
schismatic
greek
who
has
come
here
to
betray
christianity
on
the
contrary
said
ugolini
he
may
yet
save
christendom
from
a
terrible
error
de
verceuil
i
demand
that
you
take
your
hands
off
him
daoud
let
his
body
go
suddenly
limp
so
that
de
verceuil
was
holding
up
all
of
his
weight
by
his
tunic
at
the
jerk
on
his
arms
de
verceuil
gave
a
snort
of
disgust
and
let
go
pushing
daoud
away
from
him
daoud
collapsed
into
his
chair
i
am
only
a
trader
he
said
plaintively
to
the
room
in
general
i
am
sorry
i
ever
said
a
word
to
the
damned
tartars
it
has
meant
nothing
but
trouble
for
me
why
did
i
not
remain
silent
adding
a
strong
flavoring
of
drunkenness
he
imitated
the
gestures
of
greek
merchants
he
had
seen
in
the
bazaars
of
el
kahira
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
surveying
the
onlookers
he
could
not
see
sophia
which
was
good
he
wanted
her
like
lorenzo
far
away
perhaps
she
was
still
in
the
garden
with
de
gobignon
no
daoud
saw
the
young
french
count
head
he
was
pushing
his
way
through
the
audience
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
her
hands
nervously
smoothing
down
the
front
of
her
blue
velvet
gown
confronted
de
verceuil
eminence
leave
this
man
alone
he
is
a
guest
in
this
house
as
you
are
which
is
a
thing
i
begin
to
regret
contessa
this
is
all
a
mistake
said
de
verceuil
pleadingly
daoud
suspected
he
feared
the
ignominy
of
finding
the
ambassadors
and
himself
out
in
the
street
it
is
not
a
mistake
ugolini
seemed
to
have
plucked
up
his
courage
now
my
esteemed
colleague
of
the
sacred
college
is
trying
to
punish
david
because
the
tartars
spoke
frankly
to
him
david
made
no
accusations
the
tartars
accused
themselves
the
contessa
seized
ugolini
arm
oh
your
eminence
will
god
be
angry
with
me
for
harboring
these
demons
ugolini
patted
her
hands
you
can
not
be
blamed
dear
contessa
you
acted
in
good
faith
at
the
request
of
his
holiness
himself
he
having
heard
what
the
tartars
said
tonight
may
also
regret
this
affair
ugolini
looked
accusingly
at
de
verceuil
who
looked
as
if
he
wished
he
could
tear
his
little
colleague
of
the
sacred
college
limb
from
limb
now
simon
de
gobignon
having
broken
through
the
circle
of
onlookers
declared
this
would
not
have
happened
if
friar
mathieu
had
been
here
interpreting
for
the
tartars
guarding
them
against
indiscretions
instead
you
found
this
woman
who
is
altogether
ignorant
of
what
is
at
stake
here
you
had
her
translate
for
the
tartars
because
you
begrudge
friar
mathieu
his
share
of
the
honor
of
this
diplomatic
accomplishment
except
that
there
will
be
no
accomplishment
because
of
your
bungling
tall
as
de
verceuil
was
de
gobignon
was
taller
righteous
anger
made
the
french
boy
blue
eyes
flash
daoud
wanted
to
laugh
aloud
at
the
count
fury
and
de
verceuil
utter
embarrassment
but
he
decided
he
should
be
too
stupidly
drunk
to
understand
what
was
going
on
you
have
no
right
to
criticize
me
de
verceuil
shouted
be
sure
that
the
count
will
hear
of
this
simon
answered
verceuil
offending
fra
tomasso
would
be
even
better
than
de
verceuil
shouting
at
de
gobignon
if
there
were
a
way
i
could
make
that
happen
sophia
working
through
de
gobignon
even
though
his
sufi
training
helped
him
keep
his
mind
clear
puzzling
out
this
new
idea
was
beyond
his
present
powers
after
all
the
wine
he
had
drunk
daoud
let
his
head
fall
forward
and
his
eyes
met
the
penetrating
black
gaze
of
john
chagan
john
was
drunk
and
he
did
not
speak
the
language
of
these
people
but
daoud
saw
understanding
in
the
crinkled
brown
face
john
could
not
know
daoud
was
a
mameluke
but
he
knew
him
for
an
enemy
he
looked
at
daoud
with
the
same
icy
determination
to
annihilate
all
enemies
as
daoud
had
seen
staring
at
him
from
under
the
helmets
of
the
tartars
at
the
well
of
goliath
and
daoud
slumped
in
his
chair
felt
the
same
implacable
resolution
he
had
felt
that
day
to
fight
back
until
the
last
invader
was
driven
from
the
dar
the
abode
of
islam
the
tartar
army
appeared
as
a
darkness
across
the
eastern
horizon
deepening
as
it
spread
clouds
towered
above
the
line
like
djinns
the
distant
thunder
of
hooves
reached
the
mameluke
commanders
as
they
halted
in
the
plain
between
the
hills
of
galilee
and
the
mountains
of
gilboa
near
a
village
called
ain
jalut
the
well
of
goliath
a
fierce
sun
beat
down
on
yellow
grass
and
dusty
tamarisks
el
malik
qutuz
was
mounted
on
a
stallion
from
hedjaz
in
the
midst
of
his
emirs
baibars
rode
a
mare
part
arabian
and
part
steppe
pony
daoud
in
his
early
twenties
and
risen
through
the
ranks
of
baibars
personal
guard
to
be
second
in
command
of
the
orta
fifteen
thousand
strong
sat
on
his
sturdy
yemenite
stallion
before
the
other
emirs
his
red
turban
shaded
his
face
and
shielded
his
steel
helmet
from
the
sun
his
chest
was
encased
in
the
breastplate
of
an
emir
steel
inlaid
with
gold
the
mameluke
emirs
bashis
and
muqaddams
wore
their
fortunes
into
battle
gold
bracelets
and
belts
jeweled
rings
necklaces
of
coins
jewels
sparkled
on
their
belt
buckles
and
the
scabbards
and
hilts
of
their
scimitars
on
their
turbans
on
the
toes
of
their
boots
on
their
fingers
over
their
mail
shirts
and
breastplates
the
emirs
wore
velvet
vests
and
long
khalats
of
crimson
or
gold
satin
lined
with
white
silk
fastened
with
gold
buttons
trimmed
with
silver
thread
at
the
collars
and
cuffs
and
hems
silk
turbans
were
wound
around
their
helmets
red
blue
yellow
pinned
with
jeweled
clasps
and
adorned
with
the
plumes
of
rare
birds
tied
tight
around
their
waists
were
wide
shawls
printed
with
stars
and
crescents
their
boots
were
of
soft
leather
with
silver
spurs
gold
buckles
and
pointed
toes
all
that
i
daoud
thought
be
torn
from
me
in
an
instant
from
daoud
neck
hung
the
silver
locket
given
to
him
by
his
first
and
so
far
only
wife
baibars
daughter
blossoming
reed
it
was
she
had
told
him
a
magical
thing
the
mamelukes
were
now
the
last
defenders
of
islam
the
tartars
having
conquered
baghdad
and
damascus
el
kahira
was
the
only
remaining
center
of
muslim
strength
if
the
tartars
overcame
the
mamelukes
all
that
remained
of
the
dar
would
lie
open
to
the
invaders
even
the
holiest
place
of
all
mecca
the
house
of
god
we
are
a
hundred
thousand
and
they
not
a
fourth
of
that
said
qutuz
almost
petulantly
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
oncoming
tartars
how
can
they
dare
to
turn
and
fight
us
they
are
tartars
said
baibars
they
do
not
fear
the
numbers
of
their
enemies
being
a
tartar
yourself
you
can
tell
us
how
they
think
said
qutuz
daoud
heard
a
faint
undertone
of
contempt
in
the
kurd
voice
baibars
must
have
heard
it
too
daoud
saw
his
lord
cheeks
darken
slightly
looking
into
the
sultan
set
face
daoud
realized
that
qutuz
despite
his
apparent
disdain
had
already
given
up
the
battle
his
lips
almost
hidden
in
his
oiled
black
beard
were
pressed
tight
in
an
effort
to
keep
them
from
trembling
the
mamelukes
might
outnumber
the
tartars
today
but
the
tartars
had
never
been
defeated
anywhere
in
the
world
the
sultan
must
have
led
the
army
to
what
he
saw
as
certain
death
for
himself
and
all
of
them
only
because
he
knew
his
mameluke
emirs
would
depose
and
kill
him
if
he
did
not
can
a
mameluke
fear
death
or
even
defeat
qutuz
has
been
sultan
too
with
the
help
of
god
my
brothers
said
qutuz
his
voice
hollow
let
us
ride
forth
and
slay
them
i
will
command
the
center
kalawun
the
left
wing
and
baibars
the
right
when
you
see
my
green
banner
dip
we
will
advance
to
surround
and
destroy
them
does
not
believe
that
god
will
help
thought
daoud
he
does
not
believe
he
can
help
riding
over
the
dusty
field
to
rejoin
the
men
under
his
command
daoud
yearned
for
the
fighting
to
begin
his
body
felt
tight
as
if
it
were
being
pressed
inward
from
all
directions
and
his
heart
seemed
to
swell
in
his
chest
trying
to
break
out
of
the
pressure
i
must
die
today
let
me
first
do
a
great
deed
for
god
by
the
time
the
oncoming
tartars
were
clearly
visible
daoud
was
back
with
the
right
wing
of
the
mameluke
army
at
the
head
of
his
own
troop
the
tartars
came
on
at
an
unhurried
trot
spread
out
in
a
series
of
long
ranks
one
behind
the
other
and
he
could
see
their
helmets
their
waving
lances
their
colored
signal
flags
he
could
hear
their
shrill
war
cries
and
the
braying
of
their
horns
above
their
front
rank
flew
their
savage
standard
rows
of
long
black
tails
of
animals
waving
from
crossbars
mounted
on
a
tall
pole
drawn
up
across
the
plain
behind
baibars
yellow
banner
were
dark
ranks
of
mameluke
heavy
cavalrymen
armed
with
tall
spears
and
wearing
steel
chain
mail
and
helmets
daoud
saw
qutuz
green
flag
small
and
far
to
the
west
dip
heard
baibars
cry
relayed
the
shout
to
his
men
in
a
moment
the
parched
earth
of
the
plain
of
the
well
of
goliath
was
trembling
under
the
hooves
of
fifteen
thousand
mameluke
horses
the
kettledrums
of
baibars
tablkhana
his
band
thundered
and
the
trumpets
blared
sending
daoud
blood
racing
daoud
drew
his
bow
of
horn
and
sinew
out
of
the
case
hanging
from
his
saddle
and
nocked
an
arrow
as
the
galloping
hooves
of
his
horse
jolted
his
body
he
let
his
voice
pour
out
of
him
in
a
long
scream
the
braying
of
the
tartars
signal
horns
floated
over
the
plain
they
too
were
galloping
bent
over
the
necks
of
their
ponies
the
tartar
horses
were
their
bodies
encased
in
leather
armor
little
daoud
thought
the
ponies
of
the
tartar
unit
passing
him
all
appeared
to
be
white
with
black
spots
the
tartars
tunics
were
brown
their
trousers
gray
and
their
iron
helmets
painted
red
ahead
of
him
daoud
saw
baibars
yellow
standard
fluttering
against
a
sky
gray
with
dust
baibars
wing
and
the
tartars
were
riding
past
each
other
the
emir
was
leading
his
men
eastward
to
daoud
left
across
an
empty
space
of
grassy
plain
the
tartar
army
was
passing
them
charging
to
the
west
arrows
flew
from
the
tartars
but
singly
not
in
volleys
daoud
loosed
an
arrow
of
his
own
at
the
passing
horde
it
arced
over
the
bare
strip
between
the
two
armies
and
fell
in
the
tartar
mass
without
result
that
he
could
see
he
looked
back
toward
the
center
of
the
mameluke
host
and
saw
small
figures
in
white
robes
striding
through
the
grass
they
were
holy
men
he
knew
dervishes
dedicated
to
death
as
they
marched
on
foot
and
unarmed
against
the
tartars
they
were
calling
on
god
to
avenge
the
martyrs
of
islam
arrows
flew
at
them
from
the
tartar
lines
and
in
an
instant
it
seemed
the
dervishes
vanished
as
they
crumpled
into
the
tall
grass
are
showing
all
of
us
how
to
thought
daoud
by
going
joyfully
to
their
deaths
the
dervishes
reminded
the
mamelukes
that
each
warrior
who
died
here
today
would
be
a
mujahid
one
who
fell
in
holy
war
for
islam
such
a
one
was
destined
for
paradise
but
he
also
realized
uneasily
that
he
had
seen
a
demonstration
of
tartar
marksmanship
signal
flags
yellow
green
and
red
fluttered
among
the
tartar
horsemen
and
horns
bellowed
daoud
heard
the
pounding
of
a
great
battery
of
drums
from
twenty
thousand
tartar
throats
at
once
there
rose
a
long
terrifying
scream
daoud
turned
in
the
saddle
to
see
the
entire
tartar
army
now
in
a
wedge
formation
the
standard
at
the
point
of
the
triangle
rushing
upon
the
green
banner
of
sultan
qutuz
a
blue
flag
fluttered
beside
baibars
yellow
one
the
signal
to
halt
daoud
raised
his
arm
and
shouted
the
order
to
his
troop
the
mameluke
right
wing
rumbled
to
a
stop
and
turned
their
horses
to
face
the
fighting
that
had
just
passed
them
by
reining
up
his
horse
daoud
put
his
bow
back
in
its
case
he
blinked
as
bright
bursts
of
light
flashed
above
the
distant
ranks
in
the
center
of
the
mameluke
army
swiftly
that
part
of
the
field
was
enveloped
in
thick
clouds
of
brown
smoke
a
moment
later
he
heard
popping
sounds
like
the
cracking
of
innumerable
boards
the
dim
shapes
of
horses
plunged
and
reared
in
the
smoke
he
heard
his
men
muttering
to
one
another
behind
him
think
it
is
daoud
having
seen
the
tartar
army
in
action
when
he
visited
baghdad
disguised
as
a
christian
trader
recognized
the
fiery
noisemakers
he
turned
and
shouted
it
is
not
magic
i
seen
this
before
it
is
like
greek
fire
but
it
does
not
hurt
it
just
makes
noise
and
smoke
he
saw
smiles
of
relief
among
those
who
had
heard
him
they
would
pass
the
word
to
the
others
farther
back
and
the
troops
would
settle
down
he
peered
anxiously
into
the
chaos
of
smoke
and
dust
and
horses
and
men
trying
to
see
the
tartar
standard
with
its
long
black
tails
and
qutuz
green
banner
they
had
been
close
together
when
he
last
saw
them
now
he
could
not
find
them
a
movement
near
the
western
horizon
caught
his
eye
he
saw
a
bit
of
green
waving
just
below
the
blue
galilee
hills
that
separated
this
plain
of
esdraelon
from
the
coast
qutuz
banner
smaller
farther
away
despair
clutched
at
daoud
but
qutuz
could
be
feigning
a
retreat
to
lure
the
tartars
into
spreading
themselves
too
thin
then
he
saw
the
black
tartar
standard
much
closer
in
the
midst
of
a
furious
melee
of
fighting
men
and
falling
horses
half
obscured
by
dust
qutuz
would
not
leave
part
of
the
center
behind
to
fight
the
tartars
unless
he
were
running
away
daoud
remembered
the
tightness
he
had
seen
in
qutuz
face
before
the
battle
the
hopelessness
in
the
sultan
voice
is
fleeing
in
terror
we
are
all
dead
men
islam
is
daoud
looked
to
the
east
and
saw
that
baibars
was
still
sitting
motionless
a
small
figure
at
this
distance
on
his
fawn
the
bearer
with
the
yellow
standard
sitting
behind
him
daoud
turned
in
the
saddle
and
swept
his
gaze
over
the
long
line
of
his
own
troop
their
red
turbans
bobbed
up
and
down
as
their
horses
danced
the
wind
was
from
the
north
and
their
scarlet
cloaks
fluttered
behind
them
the
bearded
faces
in
the
front
rank
were
grave
but
there
was
no
fear
there
was
no
murmuring
now
no
questioning
their
mounts
brown
white
and
black
the
finest
steeds
in
stood
with
necks
stretched
and
ears
laid
back
eager
for
the
charge
an
orange
pennant
beside
baibars
standard
summoned
the
commanders
to
confer
with
their
leader
i
go
to
the
emir
for
orders
daoud
said
loudly
so
they
would
not
think
he
was
fleeing
the
field
by
the
time
he
reached
baibars
a
half
circle
of
five
emirs
and
ten
bashis
had
formed
around
their
commander
daoud
could
hear
baibars
muttering
to
himself
in
his
boyhood
kipchaq
tongue
curses
no
doubt
far
to
the
north
daoud
saw
horsemen
riding
westward
away
from
the
battlefield
the
left
wing
under
kalawun
the
tartars
had
come
nowhere
near
them
they
must
have
given
way
to
fear
when
they
saw
the
center
fall
back
daoud
saw
no
fear
in
baibars
brown
face
his
wide
mouth
with
its
thin
lips
was
formed
in
a
half
smile
the
expression
around
his
eyes
the
blue
one
that
saw
so
deeply
and
the
opaque
white
was
calm
and
confident
he
pulled
on
his
reins
to
turn
his
so
that
his
back
was
to
the
field
of
battle
most
of
our
army
has
fled
his
voice
was
deep
and
so
full
of
confidence
daoud
almost
thought
he
heard
laughter
in
it
the
tartars
think
they
have
won
now
therefore
let
us
ride
against
them
the
commanders
looked
at
one
another
in
wonderment
buoyed
up
by
baibars
calm
strength
daoud
felt
himself
despising
the
officers
under
his
and
baibars
command
think
baibars
is
mad
to
the
devil
with
them
even
if
he
is
mad
i
will
follow
him
and
die
with
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
if
baibars
should
fall
god
forbid
then
he
would
have
to
lead
these
fifteen
thousand
men
for
a
moment
he
was
seized
by
fear
whether
of
his
lord
death
or
of
having
to
lead
alone
he
was
not
sure
baibars
saw
the
disbelief
of
his
officers
you
do
not
deserve
to
ride
with
me
he
said
and
now
there
was
scorn
in
his
tone
have
you
not
always
risked
death
in
battle
can
the
tartars
do
more
to
you
than
kill
you
i
tell
you
if
we
are
defeated
better
to
die
here
than
live
as
fugitives
now
go
to
your
troops
in
a
moment
you
will
see
my
standard
move
against
them
do
as
you
will
follow
or
run
away
as
you
choose
and
god
will
reward
you
accordingly
if
i
must
i
will
ride
alone
daoud
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
head
in
dizzy
excitement
you
will
not
ride
alone
lord
said
daoud
fiercely
no
bunduqdari
no
said
another
emir
bektout
a
kipchaq
like
baibars
let
us
offer
our
lives
to
god
and
ride
out
with
light
hearts
the
other
officers
shouted
their
eagerness
to
die
for
islam
daoud
felt
full
of
gratitude
baibars
had
put
the
spirit
of
war
back
into
them
he
had
done
what
qutuz
could
never
do
after
the
other
emirs
had
ridden
back
to
their
troops
baibars
said
quietly
to
daoud
i
truly
believe
i
will
win
until
the
instant
that
they
kill
me
i
will
know
that
i
am
winning
back
at
the
head
of
his
own
troop
daoud
watched
baibars
and
waited
for
a
moment
a
silence
fell
over
this
part
of
the
field
the
drumming
of
hooves
the
clash
of
steel
and
the
screams
of
men
carried
clearly
from
far
to
the
west
baibars
on
horseback
sat
a
short
distance
in
front
of
the
long
dark
ranks
of
mamelukes
he
turned
and
beckoned
to
his
standard
bearer
who
trotted
forward
bearing
the
yellow
silk
banner
inscribed
with
the
words
of
the
koran
in
black
letters
for
the
safety
of
the
faith
slay
the
enemies
of
islam
baibars
took
the
banner
in
his
right
hand
and
held
it
high
then
lowered
it
till
its
end
rested
in
a
leather
socket
beside
his
foot
in
his
left
hand
his
sword
hand
his
long
curved
saif
inlaid
with
gold
flashed
in
the
sunlight
his
fawn
pawed
the
air
with
her
front
hooves
oh
god
give
us
victory
he
shouted
yah
an
echoing
roar
came
back
from
the
ranks
of
the
right
wing
half
standing
in
his
copper
stirrups
guiding
his
mare
with
the
pressure
of
his
legs
baibars
sent
her
into
a
headlong
gallop
daoud
struck
his
spurs
into
his
own
horse
flanks
and
raced
after
him
he
squinted
into
the
wind
that
blew
his
beard
back
against
his
neck
the
dark
blur
of
struggling
tartars
and
mamelukes
grew
rapidly
larger
qutuz
banner
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
the
tartar
standard
rose
up
in
the
west
and
kalawun
black
banner
was
waving
far
to
the
north
they
were
coming
on
the
tartar
horsemen
from
the
flank
and
rear
daoud
was
close
enough
to
see
faces
turn
and
tartars
wheel
their
ponies
to
meet
the
attack
daoud
drew
his
bow
out
again
picked
a
big
tartar
with
a
drooping
black
mustache
and
loosed
an
arrow
at
him
the
tartar
fell
back
over
his
gray
pony
rump
and
the
pony
slowed
trotted
out
of
the
tartar
formation
and
stood
nibbling
on
the
tall
dead
grass
while
its
dead
master
lay
nearby
three
tartars
peeled
off
from
their
formation
and
charged
at
daoud
his
arrows
took
two
of
them
and
an
arrow
from
one
of
his
men
struck
down
the
third
elated
he
whispered
a
prayer
of
thanks
to
god
baibars
yellow
standard
changed
direction
following
it
daoud
pulled
his
horse
around
and
raced
away
from
the
tartars
he
stood
in
the
stirrups
bow
and
an
arrow
in
hand
with
a
arrow
nocked
resting
his
right
knee
against
his
heavy
wood
and
leather
saddle
he
turned
until
he
was
looking
over
his
horse
rear
and
took
careful
aim
to
steady
his
aim
he
fired
the
arrow
just
after
his
horse
four
feet
struck
the
ground
he
saw
a
tartar
thrown
off
his
pony
by
the
force
of
the
arrow
and
he
laughed
aloud
he
saw
files
of
tartars
pulling
away
from
the
main
formation
which
was
pursuing
qutuz
and
kalawun
baibars
attack
was
pulling
the
tartars
apart
love
for
baibars
surged
within
him
the
tartars
were
said
to
be
masters
of
warfare
but
baibars
could
even
them
following
the
yellow
standard
daoud
rode
back
and
forth
over
the
field
he
lost
all
sense
of
the
progress
of
the
battle
for
brief
moments
he
took
his
eyes
off
the
enemy
warriors
to
glance
up
at
the
sun
a
pale
disk
visible
through
a
haze
of
smoke
and
dust
to
see
in
which
direction
he
was
riding
many
times
he
shot
his
last
arrow
got
down
from
his
horse
and
standing
in
the
grass
with
horsemen
galloping
all
around
him
refilled
his
quiver
from
those
of
fallen
mamelukes
and
from
the
bodies
of
tartars
mounted
or
on
foot
he
felt
as
if
no
arrow
or
sword
could
touch
him
he
seemed
when
he
had
ridden
out
to
battle
to
have
left
fear
somewhere
behind
he
recognized
mamelukes
from
other
ortas
riding
beside
him
and
his
hopes
leapt
at
the
sight
of
them
they
must
have
come
back
to
join
the
battle
from
the
shattered
left
wing
and
center
following
the
yellow
standard
he
saw
that
the
tartars
were
now
always
on
his
left
for
the
most
part
he
kept
his
eyes
on
them
and
stayed
close
to
the
other
mamelukes
the
plain
was
almost
featureless
but
glancing
to
his
right
from
time
to
time
he
noticed
certain
twisted
trees
and
black
boulders
he
was
sure
he
had
passed
before
the
sun
was
halfway
between
the
zenith
and
the
western
horizon
when
the
yellow
standard
halted
the
mamelukes
turned
to
face
the
tartars
whose
standard
rose
from
their
midst
looking
to
either
side
daoud
saw
curving
lines
of
mounted
mamelukes
stretching
until
they
disappeared
around
the
edges
of
the
packed
tartar
mass
what
had
happened
baibars
refusal
to
abandon
the
field
and
the
greater
numbers
of
the
mamelukes
must
have
tipped
the
scales
heart
pounded
with
joy
as
he
realized
that
they
had
ground
down
the
numbers
of
the
tartars
and
surrounded
the
survivors
baibars
down
the
mameluke
line
called
out
finish
them
one
by
one
hand
to
hand
he
still
held
high
the
banner
of
the
orta
he
raised
his
curved
saif
and
pointed
it
at
the
tartars
he
turned
toward
daoud
for
a
moment
and
daoud
saw
the
exaltation
in
his
face
baibars
face
was
coated
with
gray
dust
his
gold
khalat
was
streaked
with
blood
and
none
of
it
daoud
was
sure
was
his
an
angel
must
be
riding
on
his
shoulder
with
another
wave
of
his
saif
baibars
charged
into
the
mass
of
tartars
howling
in
an
ecstasy
of
fury
the
rest
of
the
mamelukes
rushed
after
him
daoud
reached
over
his
shoulder
and
pulled
his
curving
saif
from
its
scabbard
he
tried
to
ride
near
baibars
but
a
wall
of
tartars
rose
up
between
them
while
he
fought
for
his
own
life
daoud
could
only
pray
that
god
would
protect
baibars
and
then
he
was
no
longer
fighting
many
tartars
but
just
one
they
had
chosen
each
other
out
of
the
struggling
multitudes
like
partners
in
a
dance
daoud
saw
his
man
as
vividly
as
if
he
had
been
staring
at
him
for
hours
red
ribbons
fluttered
from
the
sides
of
his
iron
helmet
the
ends
of
his
black
mustache
hung
down
on
either
side
of
his
mouth
like
whiplashes
his
cheeks
and
chin
bore
the
ridges
of
thick
scars
he
seemed
to
have
cut
into
his
flesh
his
nose
had
been
crushed
in
some
past
battle
and
it
was
a
shapeless
lump
between
his
jutting
cheekbones
his
eyes
were
hard
and
expressionless
daoud
rode
at
the
tartar
eagerly
rejoicing
that
for
now
the
battle
was
between
himself
and
this
one
man
for
him
now
this
tartar
was
all
tartars
the
scarred
brown
face
was
utterly
concentrated
on
a
single
purpose
to
kill
daoud
the
tartar
reminded
daoud
of
a
tale
told
by
a
storyteller
in
a
bazaar
at
el
kahira
of
invincible
bronze
warriors
statues
brought
to
life
by
a
magician
daoud
yemenite
stallion
leapt
at
the
tartar
as
daoud
brought
his
saif
down
the
tartar
raised
his
round
shield
and
easily
caught
the
blow
of
daoud
sword
while
swinging
his
own
scimitar
around
at
chest
the
blade
struck
daoud
ribs
on
the
left
side
the
cunningly
woven
rings
of
damascene
steel
under
daoud
tunic
stopped
the
edge
of
the
blade
but
the
blow
sent
a
shock
of
pain
through
his
body
daoud
struck
downward
again
with
his
saif
and
chopped
a
deep
gash
in
the
tartar
shield
the
force
of
the
blow
hurt
daoud
arm
his
tall
yemenite
and
the
tartar
piebald
pony
pranced
in
a
cloud
of
dust
as
their
riders
slashed
at
each
other
the
tartar
brown
tunic
hung
in
ribbons
daoud
saw
a
spot
of
sunlight
reflected
from
his
silver
locket
flash
in
the
tartar
eyes
the
tartar
glanced
at
daoud
chest
his
eyes
caught
by
the
light
in
that
instant
daoud
thrust
straight
at
his
throat
he
thought
he
had
no
chance
of
hitting
the
right
spot
but
the
point
of
his
saif
went
in
just
below
the
tartar
chin
and
above
his
high
leather
collar
blood
poured
after
the
sword
point
as
daoud
jerked
it
out
god
daoud
thought
with
delight
as
he
saw
that
he
had
won
and
he
thought
with
thankfulness
of
blossoming
reed
for
her
gift
of
the
locket
for
the
first
time
an
instant
away
from
death
an
expression
of
feeling
crossed
the
tartar
face
his
lips
parted
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
pulled
down
in
a
grimace
of
pain
and
disgust
daoud
had
to
parry
one
more
blow
of
the
scimitar
before
the
tartar
slumped
over
in
the
saddle
and
slid
to
the
ground
disappearing
in
the
dust
kicked
up
by
the
hooves
of
a
dozen
milling
horses
in
his
last
moment
the
tartar
had
still
been
trying
to
kill
him
we
have
destroyed
them
a
voice
cried
near
him
it
was
mahmoud
naqeeb
of
daoud
old
training
troop
he
now
wore
the
plain
gold
belt
buckle
of
an
emir
of
drums
in
command
of
forty
mounted
warriors
his
beard
was
whiter
now
but
he
rode
easily
and
held
his
scimitar
with
a
young
strength
mamelukes
rode
forward
on
all
sides
of
daoud
their
saifs
stabbing
the
air
the
victory
whoops
of
his
fellow
mamelukes
were
for
daoud
a
draft
of
elixir
from
paradise
filling
him
with
new
strength
great
baibars
honor
to
his
name
has
defeated
those
who
never
knew
defeat
mahmoud
exulted
as
the
last
word
left
his
lips
a
tartar
arrow
long
as
a
javelin
thudded
into
his
chest
he
gasped
and
his
eyes
met
daoud
he
dropped
his
scimitar
and
his
hand
reached
out
to
grasp
daoud
arm
a
good
moment
he
grated
praise
god
he
slumped
in
the
saddle
the
flowing
white
beard
fluttering
in
the
east
wind
grief
shot
through
daoud
like
the
tartar
arrow
that
had
pierced
his
old
naqeeb
daoud
knew
what
mahmoud
last
words
meant
it
was
the
best
of
moments
to
die
a
moment
of
triumph
a
moment
of
grief
for
me
mahmoud
because
i
have
seen
you
daoud
rode
forward
over
dead
tartars
to
the
place
where
the
enemy
had
planted
their
standard
on
a
small
hill
bunched
together
the
last
few
tartars
fought
on
foot
a
fierce
joy
swept
daoud
victory
he
had
believed
that
god
would
not
allow
islam
last
defenders
to
be
defeated
but
the
wonder
of
a
triumph
over
the
invincible
tartars
was
so
overwhelming
that
he
almost
fell
from
his
saddle
in
the
midst
of
the
tartars
one
man
dashed
this
way
and
that
shouting
orders
to
the
few
dozen
men
as
if
they
were
still
thousands
he
wore
a
gold
tablet
stamped
with
symbols
on
a
chain
around
his
neck
the
badge
of
a
tartar
officer
scouts
had
reported
that
this
tartar
army
was
commanded
by
one
called
ket
bogha
this
must
be
he
ket
bogha
shot
arrows
into
the
tightening
circle
of
mamelukes
until
he
had
no
more
arrows
left
he
threw
javelins
then
he
stood
with
his
sword
held
before
him
not
the
usual
tartar
saber
but
a
sword
that
he
swung
ferociously
at
anyone
who
approached
with
a
single
swipe
of
his
sword
ket
bogha
cut
off
the
foreleg
of
a
horse
that
rode
at
him
the
horse
toppled
screaming
to
the
ground
and
the
rider
barely
managed
to
jump
free
and
run
away
as
ket
bogha
slashed
at
him
the
battle
ended
for
ket
bogha
as
six
naqeebs
clubbed
the
tartar
general
to
the
ground
with
the
butt
ends
of
their
lances
deserved
better
than
daoud
thought
sadly
but
the
momentary
sympathy
for
his
conquered
enemy
was
swept
away
in
the
ecstatic
floodtide
of
triumph
now
the
battle
was
truly
over
and
the
mamelukes
had
won
over
the
tartars
the
naqeebs
bound
ket
bogha
arms
baibars
himself
dismounted
and
took
the
tartar
general
great
sword
and
tied
it
to
his
own
saddle
then
lifted
the
gold
tablet
from
around
his
neck
and
dropped
it
into
his
saddle
pack
smiling
he
spoke
to
ket
bogha
in
the
language
of
the
tartars
and
tied
a
rope
around
his
neck
then
he
mounted
his
own
mare
and
led
the
defeated
general
past
heaps
of
tartar
and
mameluke
dead
and
clusters
of
rejoicing
muslim
warriors
daoud
and
then
baibars
other
emirs
and
bashis
followed
the
standard
of
qutuz
was
back
on
the
field
looking
more
black
than
green
with
the
afternoon
sun
behind
it
can
it
be
can
it
be
that
we
have
truly
won
mamelukes
cried
running
beside
baibars
horse
baibars
yah
baibars
cried
the
warriors
as
baibars
rode
slowly
over
the
field
tell
us
baibars
that
we
have
won
as
an
answer
baibars
gestured
grandly
to
his
captive
stumbling
along
behind
him
baibars
bringer
of
victory
the
sultan
servants
were
already
setting
up
his
gold
silk
pavilion
on
the
edge
of
the
battlefield
when
baibars
rode
before
qutuz
pulling
ket
bogha
a
deafening
roar
went
up
from
the
emirs
the
bashis
the
muqaddams
the
naqeebs
the
troopers
daoud
glanced
at
qutuz
and
saw
that
his
eyes
were
wide
and
his
face
pale
he
must
still
be
dazed
by
the
outcome
of
this
battle
but
the
sultan
stepped
forward
to
peer
at
ket
bogha
as
the
tartar
general
was
freed
from
baibars
rope
qutuz
gestured
to
his
men
to
untie
ket
bogha
a
circle
of
emirs
formed
around
qutuz
and
the
tartar
commander
to
hear
what
they
would
say
to
each
other
qutuz
had
found
time
at
the
end
of
the
battle
to
have
his
black
beard
combed
and
oiled
and
to
robe
himself
afresh
his
black
and
gold
khalat
glittered
in
the
hazy
sunlight
the
mamelukes
had
stripped
ket
bogha
of
his
armor
and
he
stood
before
the
sultan
in
a
dirty
bloodstained
tunic
that
had
once
been
a
bright
blue
his
shaven
head
was
round
as
a
ball
and
like
most
tartars
daoud
had
seen
his
short
legs
were
bowed
from
a
lifetime
in
the
saddle
once
again
daoud
felt
sorrow
for
the
tartar
leader
who
looked
like
a
lonely
island
in
the
midst
of
a
sea
of
joy
since
baibars
spoke
both
tartar
and
arabic
he
stood
between
the
sultan
and
the
tartar
general
to
translate
you
have
overthrown
kingdoms
from
the
jordan
to
the
roof
of
the
world
said
qutuz
through
baibars
how
does
it
feel
to
be
defeated
yourself
released
from
his
bonds
ket
bogha
paced
furiously
back
and
forth
before
qutuz
he
started
to
talk
so
rapidly
the
interpreter
could
not
keep
up
with
him
daoud
was
amazed
to
see
that
he
actually
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
what
qutuz
had
said
still
feels
the
excitement
of
the
daoud
thought
by
walking
and
talking
as
he
does
he
keeps
at
bay
his
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
army
his
words
are
as
much
for
himself
as
for
the
sultan
and
the
defeat
said
baibars
speaking
ket
bogha
words
oh
sultan
do
not
play
the
fool
by
claiming
this
skirmish
as
a
victory
you
rashly
chose
to
overrun
this
handful
of
men
but
the
harm
you
have
done
to
hulagu
khan
is
that
which
a
gnat
does
to
an
elephant
you
have
not
hurt
him
you
have
angered
him
the
men
and
horses
he
has
lost
here
the
wives
of
his
soldiers
and
the
mares
in
his
paddocks
will
make
up
in
a
single
night
you
talk
like
some
old
storyteller
in
the
marketplace
who
tries
to
frighten
children
said
qutuz
in
a
shrill
voice
amazement
all
of
us
feel
that
we
are
not
only
alive
but
victorious
must
be
even
stronger
in
qutuz
most
of
my
mameluke
comrades
may
think
that
their
sultan
planned
for
victory
all
along
but
he
himself
knows
ket
bogha
stopped
pacing
and
pointed
a
stubby
finger
at
qutuz
soon
hulagu
khan
will
return
from
beyond
the
oxus
and
the
hooves
of
his
horses
will
trample
your
land
all
the
way
to
the
nile
and
beyond
he
will
do
to
your
cairo
what
he
did
to
baghdad
qutuz
laughed
harshly
your
faith
in
your
master
is
touching
but
i
will
have
your
head
carried
before
me
on
a
spear
when
i
ride
back
to
egypt
he
can
not
save
you
from
that
i
would
rather
die
for
my
khan
than
be
like
you
one
who
rose
to
power
by
murdering
his
rightful
lord
ket
bogha
cried
baibars
smiled
wryly
as
he
repeated
the
tartar
words
in
arabic
qutuz
went
white
with
fury
take
him
away
and
cut
his
head
off
he
ordered
and
you
baibars
how
dare
you
repeat
such
a
slander
to
me
i
never
murdered
anyone
qutuz
command
revolted
daoud
after
the
poor
part
the
sultan
had
played
in
the
battle
he
had
no
right
to
take
the
head
of
a
brave
enemy
daoud
heard
baibars
give
a
little
snort
of
disgust
and
the
emir
strode
to
qutuz
side
baibars
spoke
in
a
low
voice
but
daoud
heard
him
my
lord
this
is
not
worthy
of
a
sultan
in
his
hour
of
victory
this
is
a
brave
commander
and
i
repeated
all
that
he
said
because
you
wished
me
to
qutuz
glared
wildly
at
baibars
be
still
i
will
not
spare
your
fellow
tartar
qutuz
daoud
thought
with
smoldering
wrath
was
not
worthy
to
be
sultan
baibars
turned
his
back
on
qutuz
the
brown
face
was
impassive
but
in
the
one
blue
eye
daoud
saw
death
xxiii
the
rats
scavenged
in
the
garbage
and
the
cats
hunted
the
rats
and
cats
and
rats
scurried
out
of
the
way
of
the
two
men
who
staggered
beneath
a
waning
moon
through
the
streets
of
orvieto
i
was
truly
drunk
said
daoud
but
only
my
body
was
drunk
it
is
still
drunk
he
walked
with
one
arm
thrown
over
lorenzo
shoulder
to
steady
his
steps
it
must
have
rained
during
the
evening
the
streets
were
slippery
and
the
clean
vaporous
scent
of
drying
rain
was
stronger
than
the
usual
odor
of
rotting
rubbish
piled
between
the
houses
in
the
spaces
the
orvietans
called
quintane
you
feign
the
extremity
of
drunkenness
quite
well
said
lorenzo
they
had
met
by
prearrangement
on
the
street
outside
the
monaldeschi
palace
sophia
and
cardinal
ugolini
left
earlier
and
separately
carried
in
sedan
chairs
and
escorted
by
the
cardinal
guards
what
hour
is
it
daoud
asked
past
the
third
nocturn
do
you
know
what
that
means
it
was
explained
to
me
once
but
now
my
memory
seems
to
be
drunk
simply
dawn
is
not
far
off
said
celino
the
third
nocturn
is
between
midnight
and
dawn
the
contessa
reception
began
at
the
first
nocturn
between
sunset
and
midnight
tell
me
did
you
never
experience
wine
in
egypt
daoud
decided
that
much
as
he
liked
lorenzo
he
did
not
want
to
confide
any
of
saadi
most
secret
teachings
to
an
atheist
many
times
we
stayed
up
all
night
drinking
kaviyeh
talking
and
watching
the
dancers
but
we
do
not
drink
wine
really
said
lorenzo
glancing
at
him
permit
me
to
be
skeptical
i
know
many
muslims
who
drink
wine
daoud
shook
his
head
most
mamelukes
do
not
drink
wine
when
baibars
became
sultan
he
closed
all
the
wine
shops
in
el
kahira
he
also
decided
not
to
tell
lorenzo
that
in
private
baibars
enjoyed
the
tartar
drink
kumiss
made
from
the
fermented
milk
of
mares
lorenzo
grunted
then
you
mamelukes
are
stricter
in
your
observance
than
many
others
who
were
born
to
islam
they
passed
the
cathedral
of
san
giovenale
it
was
lit
within
and
the
narrow
stained
glass
windows
glowed
red
yellow
blue
and
white
go
into
a
christian
church
during
the
day
and
the
windows
are
all
alight
with
colors
at
night
the
windows
are
black
if
you
are
inside
the
church
but
brightly
lit
if
you
are
outside
as
if
the
church
is
calling
to
those
outside
in
the
so
beautiful
daoud
said
even
if
the
images
were
idolatrous
you
should
see
some
of
the
new
cathedrals
up
near
paris
the
windows
are
much
bigger
and
the
figures
are
more
lifelike
do
you
admire
the
christian
churches
daoud
asked
i
admire
beauty
wherever
i
find
it
on
sicily
there
are
beautiful
stained
glass
windows
in
many
synagogues
we
are
building
a
mosque
in
el
kahira
that
will
be
the
wonder
of
the
world
but
when
were
you
in
paris
four
years
ago
on
a
mission
for
king
manfred
years
ago
i
was
battling
tartars
in
as
they
passed
the
open
front
doors
of
the
cathedral
daoud
looked
up
the
steps
he
saw
the
bright
yellow
light
of
massed
candles
and
heard
a
chorus
of
male
voices
raised
in
song
the
voices
seemed
thin
and
high
as
if
reaching
up
into
the
night
sky
he
had
heard
such
singing
before
a
long
time
before
he
felt
a
catch
in
his
throat
why
are
the
priests
singing
so
late
at
night
those
are
the
priests
of
the
cathedral
chapter
it
is
the
beginning
of
day
for
them
they
are
chanting
lauds
the
dawn
prayer
of
the
church
listening
to
the
voices
daoud
felt
hot
tears
running
down
his
face
lorenzo
glanced
at
him
and
chuckled
i
see
you
are
not
so
impervious
to
the
attractions
of
christianity
daoud
was
embarrassed
but
he
could
not
stop
the
flow
of
tears
it
is
the
wine
he
was
remembering
high
mass
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
with
his
father
hand
on
his
shoulder
as
they
knelt
and
the
chief
priest
in
dazzling
white
and
gold
cope
raised
the
white
wafer
toward
heaven
his
father
whispered
jesus
is
come
down
among
us
and
then
his
strong
tenor
voice
joined
in
veni
creator
spiritus
weep
now
for
my
father
because
i
had
no
chance
to
weep
for
him
when
he
was
suppose
he
is
in
some
christian
heaven
looking
down
at
me
what
would
he
think
daoud
started
at
the
sound
of
his
own
words
must
be
drunk
i
would
never
speak
so
in
front
of
lorenzo
or
anyone
who
is
looking
down
at
you
lorenzo
asked
his
shoulders
were
hard
and
broad
under
daoud
arm
and
he
seemed
to
bear
daoud
weight
without
the
least
difficulty
they
were
past
the
cathedral
now
following
a
straight
fairly
wide
street
that
gently
sloped
downward
broken
clouds
drifted
away
from
the
half
moon
like
a
watchman
lantern
it
hung
over
the
center
of
the
street
between
the
overhanging
second
stories
of
the
houses
my
father
said
daoud
and
a
sob
bubbled
up
in
his
throat
as
he
softly
spoke
the
word
albeit
in
the
unfamiliar
tongue
of
italy
how
he
must
hate
me
and
curse
me
for
fighting
for
islam
lorenzo
halted
his
stride
and
lifted
his
head
then
he
started
walking
again
he
raised
his
hand
and
gripped
the
wrist
daoud
was
resting
on
his
shoulder
in
a
very
low
voice
he
said
someone
is
following
us
now
daoud
stopped
tensing
he
called
on
the
power
of
his
mind
to
resist
the
wine
his
tears
dried
on
the
instant
walk
on
said
lorenzo
in
a
low
voice
keep
your
arm
over
my
shoulder
keep
talking
to
me
in
a
louder
voice
he
said
i
do
not
believe
people
souls
go
to
a
heaven
of
any
sort
can
they
hear
us
daoud
said
softly
de
verceuil
he
thought
he
must
have
decided
to
have
me
killed
his
body
felt
cold
his
journey
from
egypt
and
all
his
work
despite
tonight
triumph
might
end
here
on
a
street
and
what
would
happen
to
sophia
if
he
were
killed
they
can
not
hear
what
we
say
but
careful
they
might
be
able
to
tell
from
the
tone
of
our
voices
whether
we
are
aware
of
them
can
you
fight
not
well
not
well
at
all
the
scorpion
the
small
crossbow
hidden
in
his
cloak
he
thought
might
account
for
one
or
two
of
them
if
he
could
see
well
enough
to
aim
it
he
blinked
his
eyes
he
saw
two
moons
hanging
over
the
street
blinked
again
and
saw
one
do
not
jews
believe
in
an
immortal
soul
he
asked
in
a
normal
voice
keeping
up
the
pretense
of
conversation
he
cursed
his
lack
of
foresight
why
had
he
not
thought
to
arrange
for
some
of
their
bravos
to
meet
them
and
escort
them
back
to
palace
because
he
did
not
want
himself
connected
with
the
fighting
men
lorenzo
had
brought
to
orvieto
that
it
had
been
a
sensible
precaution
did
not
ease
his
anguish
now
maimonides
writes
that
men
and
women
live
on
after
they
die
only
in
the
memory
of
others
said
lorenzo
of
course
orthodox
rabbis
say
that
maimonides
was
a
heretic
if
the
dead
live
on
only
in
memory
then
my
father
is
truly
dead
because
i
have
done
nothing
for
his
memory
and
i
fight
against
all
that
he
fought
for
daoud
realized
that
his
mind
was
hardly
working
he
was
relying
on
lorenzo
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
them
through
this
he
hated
having
his
life
depend
on
another
man
cleverness
he
tried
to
free
his
thoughts
from
the
poisonous
grip
of
it
had
been
easier
earlier
this
evening
but
he
was
very
tired
now
i
prefer
to
believe
that
people
become
more
broadminded
after
they
die
said
lorenzo
they
come
with
the
truth
whatever
it
is
and
they
see
how
each
of
us
turk
and
jew
and
christian
has
been
struggling
to
uphold
a
dimly
glimpsed
version
of
what
they
see
plainly
if
they
do
not
feel
sorry
for
us
then
probably
they
laugh
at
us
and
now
this
way
move
as
silently
as
you
can
abruptly
holding
tight
to
daoud
wrist
lorenzo
made
a
sharp
left
turn
into
an
alley
so
narrow
it
was
almost
invisible
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
quintana
a
tunnel
rather
than
an
alley
the
overhanging
second
stories
of
the
houses
on
either
side
actually
had
a
wall
in
common
lorenzo
pulling
him
daoud
broke
into
a
trot
all
around
them
was
a
hot
blackness
reeking
of
decay
daoud
could
hear
creatures
scrabbling
out
of
his
way
ahead
was
a
bluish
oblong
the
end
of
the
tunnel
and
the
moonlit
space
beyond
it
they
stopped
abruptly
lorenzo
swung
daoud
arm
down
and
stepped
away
from
him
gripping
him
briefly
by
the
shoulders
to
brace
him
now
you
must
clear
your
head
messer
david
i
hear
them
coming
i
think
they
saw
us
duck
in
here
get
out
your
sword
or
your
dagger
whatever
suits
you
best
and
get
ready
to
fight
daoud
heard
the
sound
of
running
boots
he
tried
to
guess
how
many
pursuers
there
were
but
his
head
was
not
clear
enough
of
wine
fumes
for
that
he
fell
against
the
rough
plaster
wall
could
he
and
lorenzo
break
through
a
doorway
into
a
house
and
hide
there
no
the
people
within
would
probably
give
them
away
he
heard
the
slithering
sound
of
lorenzo
sword
being
drawn
he
decided
not
to
use
the
scorpion
it
would
take
too
long
to
load
and
cock
it
and
if
he
fumbled
he
would
be
cut
down
without
a
second
chance
his
mind
was
fairly
clear
of
the
toxic
power
of
but
his
body
still
in
its
grip
felt
half
dead
to
him
can
i
fight
as
dizzy
as
i
am
thou
hast
said
it
o
god
wine
is
an
abomination
forgive
me
for
drinking
it
and
help
me
he
reached
for
his
sword
the
handsome
new
one
he
had
bought
in
orvieto
he
drew
it
out
slowly
as
quietly
as
he
could
and
hefted
it
in
his
hand
a
bit
late
now
to
wonder
how
it
would
stand
up
in
a
fight
the
running
footsteps
stopped
suddenly
looking
at
the
end
of
the
alley
daoud
saw
figures
silhouetted
by
the
moonlight
he
heard
voices
murmuring
then
the
figures
seemed
to
fill
the
rectangular
mouth
of
the
alley
there
seemed
to
be
six
of
them
they
moved
slowly
cautiously
capons
whispered
lorenzo
afraid
to
charge
us
let
us
move
to
where
there
is
light
to
fight
by
he
pulled
daoud
after
him
daoud
felt
his
head
clearing
he
could
hear
better
and
despite
the
darkness
see
better
but
he
staggered
as
they
ran
out
of
the
alley
they
found
themselves
in
a
campiello
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
houses
in
the
center
on
a
small
pedestal
was
a
statue
one
of
their
saint
idols
with
arms
outstretched
daoud
looked
quickly
around
him
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
but
the
alleyway
they
had
entered
through
he
heard
a
loud
thump
to
his
right
a
dark
figure
suddenly
stood
there
another
thump
on
the
left
and
another
in
front
men
were
jumping
down
from
the
rooftops
in
a
moment
four
men
in
a
rough
semicircle
faced
lorenzo
and
daoud
blades
gleamed
silvery
in
the
moonlight
the
six
others
who
had
been
pursuing
them
rushed
out
of
the
alley
filled
with
a
despairing
rage
daoud
clenched
his
teeth
and
raised
his
sword
xxiv
rachel
body
felt
cold
she
knew
the
night
outside
was
warm
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
room
was
stifling
with
all
its
candles
and
the
heavy
silk
draperies
that
held
in
the
heat
but
her
feet
and
hands
were
icy
it
was
fear
that
chilled
her
so
as
she
sat
half
listening
to
tilia
she
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
big
bed
her
feet
tucked
under
her
her
hands
clenched
in
her
lap
she
wanted
to
jump
out
the
window
only
she
was
here
of
her
own
free
will
and
anyway
the
window
was
barred
we
will
be
watching
through
spy
holes
in
the
walls
said
tilia
there
will
be
at
least
three
of
us
if
he
hurts
you
in
any
way
we
will
be
here
in
a
trice
to
rescue
you
tilia
caballo
had
a
face
like
a
frog
rachel
thought
the
fat
old
woman
was
trying
to
be
reassuring
but
just
now
rachel
hated
her
she
could
not
believe
tilia
would
interfere
with
a
wealthy
client
pleasure
no
matter
how
badly
a
girl
of
hers
was
being
hurt
the
skepticism
must
have
shown
in
her
face
because
tilia
had
said
i
know
this
man
he
has
been
here
five
times
he
is
not
the
kind
that
likes
to
hurt
women
i
do
have
patrons
of
that
sort
for
them
i
supply
women
like
olivia
sometime
when
you
are
not
so
frightened
i
may
tell
you
what
olivia
likes
men
to
do
to
her
of
course
she
pretends
not
to
like
it
her
clients
would
get
no
pleasure
if
they
knew
olivia
them
to
do
what
they
do
but
no
matter
how
i
gain
my
livelihood
i
am
still
a
woman
of
honor
she
glowered
fiercely
at
rachel
jowls
quivering
slightly
i
do
not
allow
certain
things
to
take
place
in
my
house
i
do
not
allow
my
women
to
be
mistreated
i
know
said
rachel
that
is
why
i
have
not
run
away
you
need
not
speak
of
running
away
said
tilia
loftily
the
door
will
be
open
for
you
whenever
you
wish
to
walk
through
it
rachel
believed
that
just
as
she
had
believed
gruff
lorenzo
celino
when
he
told
her
she
did
not
have
to
go
to
tilia
house
but
she
also
knew
that
if
she
had
not
come
here
or
if
she
chose
now
to
walk
out
that
door
these
people
would
do
nothing
more
for
her
staying
much
as
she
might
hate
what
would
happen
to
her
was
better
than
wandering
alone
on
the
roads
of
italy
she
looked
up
at
the
canopy
over
the
bed
it
was
as
were
the
bed
curtains
the
walls
of
the
small
room
were
hung
with
yellow
silk
drapes
framing
frescoes
showing
nude
smiling
women
fleeing
from
creatures
that
were
half
man
and
half
goat
with
things
that
stuck
out
before
them
like
spears
real
men
do
not
have
pizzles
as
big
as
that
tilia
had
said
when
she
first
showed
rachel
the
room
pointing
with
a
grin
at
a
bright
red
organ
although
it
may
look
that
big
to
you
the
first
time
you
see
one
in
all
its
glory
tilia
had
stopped
joking
then
and
had
carefully
told
her
exactly
what
would
happen
on
this
night
am
better
rachel
thought
many
a
woman
is
on
her
wedding
indeed
her
own
mother
months
before
she
died
had
already
explained
much
of
this
to
rachel
but
the
thought
of
her
mother
fairly
broke
her
heart
now
her
mother
would
cut
her
own
throat
if
she
could
see
rachel
in
this
place
about
to
let
a
man
do
this
thing
to
her
for
money
her
body
shrank
with
dread
she
would
rather
far
rather
be
the
ignorant
bride
of
a
carpenter
or
a
traveling
merchant
like
her
poor
angelo
who
had
been
her
husband
in
name
only
or
even
the
wife
of
a
butcher
than
to
lie
here
in
this
gorgeously
decorated
room
and
give
her
most
precious
gift
to
a
stranger
who
had
bought
the
right
to
deflower
her
she
found
herself
wishing
poor
old
angelo
had
asserted
his
right
as
her
husband
so
that
she
could
not
now
let
her
virginity
be
defiled
god
angelo
is
not
alive
to
see
this
but
if
he
had
lived
i
would
not
be
doing
will
never
forgive
if
god
does
not
want
me
to
do
what
i
am
doing
why
did
he
let
this
happen
to
me
tilia
sat
beside
the
bed
in
a
big
chair
with
a
curved
bottom
the
jeweled
cross
she
wore
which
reminded
rachel
that
she
was
among
christians
here
and
therefore
not
safe
rested
on
her
bosom
half
covered
by
the
gold
lace
bordering
the
neckline
of
her
gown
the
cross
quivered
minutely
with
tilia
heartbeat
you
are
probably
wondering
child
whether
you
are
doing
the
right
thing
yes
rachel
was
so
choked
with
fear
that
she
could
only
whisper
the
word
well
i
can
tell
you
there
are
thousands
of
women
who
would
give
anything
to
be
in
your
place
in
my
place
to
become
a
putana
tilia
laughed
you
think
most
women
are
contentedly
married
with
husbands
to
take
care
of
them
with
children
who
love
them
and
neighbors
who
respect
them
while
only
a
few
like
me
and
the
women
who
work
for
me
are
putane
whom
the
rest
look
down
on
well
listen
to
me
little
one
other
women
us
a
married
woman
sells
herself
body
and
soul
to
be
some
man
slave
for
life
and
she
gets
damned
little
in
return
we
rent
out
this
little
part
of
our
anatomy
she
patted
her
lap
for
a
moment
and
we
keep
the
profit
for
ourselves
if
we
are
clever
as
i
have
been
we
learn
how
to
keep
and
increase
our
money
so
when
we
no
longer
have
youth
and
beauty
to
sell
we
can
take
care
of
ourselves
and
i
tell
you
that
a
woman
in
her
later
years
is
likely
to
be
a
better
friend
to
herself
than
any
husband
speaks
with
conviction
but
i
can
not
trust
her
either
i
have
not
had
a
true
friend
in
this
world
since
angelo
was
rachel
sighed
it
is
just
that
after
tonight
there
is
no
turning
back
this
is
for
the
rest
of
my
life
that
is
right
said
tilia
you
will
give
up
something
that
you
can
lose
only
once
when
you
have
a
commodity
as
unique
as
that
my
child
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
get
the
most
you
can
for
it
her
eyes
hardened
every
man
wants
to
be
the
first
to
pierce
a
woman
and
hear
her
cry
out
and
make
her
bleed
but
what
woman
gets
anything
worth
having
in
return
she
gives
it
away
on
a
dark
night
to
some
furfante
with
a
smooth
tongue
and
a
handsome
leg
or
else
the
tonto
she
married
takes
it
from
her
and
then
tells
her
to
go
wash
the
bed
linen
she
turned
to
stare
at
rachel
do
you
know
what
i
got
for
my
virginity
her
cheeks
were
red
with
anger
what
did
you
get
signora
the
heat
with
which
tilia
spoke
reassured
rachel
this
was
what
the
woman
really
felt
she
was
not
just
talking
to
lead
rachel
astray
blows
and
slavery
tilia
thrust
her
face
close
to
rachel
to
underline
her
words
blows
and
slavery
the
genoese
may
leprosy
devour
their
limbs
and
may
their
prickles
fall
off
in
their
hands
raided
otranto
they
raped
me
that
was
how
i
lost
virginity
they
sold
me
to
the
turks
you
were
a
slave
to
the
turks
rachel
gasped
where
and
how
did
she
escape
them
and
come
to
orvieto
and
grow
so
rich
and
fat
tilia
looked
away
never
mind
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
rachel
sensed
that
there
was
something
here
tilia
did
not
want
to
talk
about
but
she
resolved
to
pry
the
story
out
of
her
one
day
tilia
head
swung
back
to
face
her
have
i
told
you
what
you
are
getting
this
night
for
giving
this
man
this
proud
moment
of
possessing
a
virgin
i
i
do
not
remember
tilia
had
named
a
figure
but
it
had
been
so
outrageous
and
rachel
had
been
so
frightened
by
the
prospect
that
she
had
promptly
forgotten
it
by
the
five
wounds
of
jesus
you
truly
are
a
child
not
to
remember
something
so
important
well
fix
it
in
your
mind
this
time
and
think
of
it
when
you
are
wondering
whether
you
are
doing
right
five
hundred
golden
florins
five
hundred
newly
minted
in
florence
that
is
your
share
that
is
half
of
what
he
is
paying
the
other
half
is
mine
as
is
only
just
think
of
it
he
pays
the
price
of
a
palazzo
for
you
because
you
are
a
very
young
beautiful
virgin
and
that
is
what
he
most
desperately
desires
compare
that
with
what
most
women
get
when
they
let
a
man
have
them
for
the
first
time
is
far
more
money
than
angelo
ever
saw
in
his
whole
life
who
is
this
man
who
will
pay
so
much
to
have
me
rachel
supposed
tilia
would
tell
her
who
the
man
was
if
she
asked
but
she
had
decided
it
was
better
not
to
know
anything
about
him
ahead
of
time
that
way
she
could
imagine
that
he
would
be
someone
kind
and
gentle
i
do
not
know
what
i
will
do
with
all
that
money
rachel
said
softly
i
lose
it
all
this
will
have
been
for
tilia
wide
mouth
stretched
even
wider
in
a
grin
i
will
show
you
how
to
plant
it
plant
it
yes
and
then
watch
it
grow
there
are
many
many
fields
in
which
to
plant
money
you
can
place
it
with
the
templars
or
certain
lombards
or
men
i
know
among
your
own
jews
and
they
use
it
and
when
they
give
it
back
to
you
there
is
more
miracolo
or
you
can
buy
beautiful
and
valuable
things
with
it
whose
worth
increases
as
they
get
older
or
you
can
buy
shares
in
a
ship
of
venice
or
pisa
or
even
she
spat
genoa
or
a
german
caravan
and
when
the
caravan
or
the
ship
comes
back
if
it
comes
back
you
get
your
money
back
tenfold
that
is
risky
but
it
is
the
quickest
way
to
great
wealth
rachel
felt
a
momentary
excitement
then
she
remembered
how
she
was
going
to
get
the
money
her
body
felt
colder
than
ever
cold
as
death
this
she
thought
must
be
the
way
that
poor
man
they
killed
last
week
felt
when
he
was
waiting
for
the
torturers
to
come
for
him
she
shuddered
and
hugged
her
knees
tight
against
her
chest
under
the
gauzy
gown
tilia
had
given
her
to
wear
tilia
must
have
seen
the
sudden
darkening
of
her
mood
she
moved
over
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
beside
rachel
making
the
frame
of
the
bed
groan
alarmingly
she
put
a
hand
lightly
on
rachel
arm
listen
rachel
i
was
raped
i
will
not
be
party
to
the
rape
of
another
you
do
not
have
to
do
this
just
tell
me
that
you
do
not
want
to
a
sudden
heat
rushed
through
rachel
body
she
was
no
longer
cold
she
burned
with
anger
stop
saying
that
she
screamed
will
you
leave
me
alone
being
reminded
over
and
over
again
that
she
was
doing
this
of
her
own
free
will
was
an
even
worse
torture
than
imagining
what
the
man
would
do
to
her
god
i
am
going
to
cry
and
make
myself
ugly
and
he
will
not
want
me
and
i
will
not
get
the
five
hundred
she
pressed
her
hands
against
her
face
trying
to
stop
tears
i
was
asking
you
to
think
not
carry
on
said
tilia
reprovingly
if
you
want
to
walk
well
in
life
you
had
better
learn
not
to
burst
into
tears
when
you
have
an
important
decision
to
make
rachel
took
deep
breaths
to
calm
herself
i
decided
days
ago
that
i
could
not
do
any
better
for
myself
than
this
signora
tilia
but
i
am
so
afraid
perhaps
the
man
will
not
want
me
when
he
sees
how
afraid
i
am
tilia
grinned
broadly
nonsense
the
more
innocent
and
timid
you
appear
the
more
you
will
delight
him
rachel
heard
a
light
tapping
at
the
door
and
her
heart
beat
so
hard
she
thought
it
would
burst
tilia
rose
brushing
down
her
green
satin
gown
the
signal
that
he
has
arrived
i
thought
he
would
never
get
here
it
almost
morning
i
must
go
down
and
greet
him
child
but
remember
i
will
be
watching
everything
do
not
really
like
tilia
winked
and
pushed
on
what
looked
like
a
plaster
panel
between
two
beams
in
the
wall
it
swung
away
from
her
and
she
squeezed
through
rachel
sat
in
the
bed
drawn
up
into
the
corner
of
it
that
was
farthest
from
the
door
and
waited
she
played
nervously
with
fingers
that
felt
like
icicles
a
short
time
later
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
tilia
pushing
open
the
door
but
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
man
standing
in
the
doorway
she
drew
in
a
deep
gasping
breath
she
wanted
to
scream
the
man
standing
in
the
doorway
was
short
and
broad
he
wore
a
long
brightly
colored
silk
robe
his
skin
was
brown
his
eyes
little
black
slits
a
white
mustache
drooped
below
his
flat
nose
a
thin
white
beard
like
a
goat
hung
from
his
chin
she
had
seen
this
man
once
before
when
she
watched
from
the
window
of
sophia
room
at
cardinal
ugolini
the
day
he
arrived
in
orvieto
in
a
great
procession
rachel
breath
so
long
held
burst
out
of
her
in
a
moan
the
man
who
had
come
to
take
her
virginity
was
a
tartar
it
was
as
much
by
my
choice
as
the
cardinal
that
i
did
not
attend
the
contessa
reception
said
friar
mathieu
yawning
how
could
a
little
brother
of
san
francesco
stay
up
till
all
hours
with
people
stuffing
themselves
with
rich
food
and
drinking
wine
and
gambling
and
kissing
each
other
in
dark
corners
the
old
franciscan
eyes
were
watery
with
sleepiness
but
the
corners
of
his
mouth
quirked
with
humor
under
his
white
mustache
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
which
as
he
had
insisted
when
he
moved
into
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
was
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
simon
paced
the
floor
unable
to
stand
still
simon
felt
the
barb
in
the
mention
of
kissing
but
he
did
not
mind
it
when
he
routed
friar
mathieu
out
of
his
narrow
bed
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
palace
he
admitted
at
once
that
he
had
been
in
the
atrium
with
ugolini
niece
sophia
while
david
of
trebizond
was
so
disastrously
baiting
the
tartars
i
was
wrong
to
pay
court
to
the
cardinal
niece
he
could
still
feel
her
lips
under
his
still
taste
them
and
his
body
tingled
at
the
remembrance
i
am
as
much
at
fault
as
de
verceuil
but
it
was
he
who
found
that
ignorant
woman
to
replace
you
as
interpreter
and
then
he
went
off
to
gamble
with
david
servant
of
all
people
and
left
the
tartars
alone
and
unprotected
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
yes
and
drinking
that
wine
of
montefiascone
i
wonder
why
god
chose
to
make
those
particular
grapes
so
irresistible
simon
pounded
his
fist
into
his
palm
we
must
confront
de
verceuil
friar
mathieu
a
deep
crease
appeared
between
the
thick
white
eyebrows
at
this
hour
simon
saw
the
fatigue
in
mathieu
wrinkled
face
and
felt
guilty
i
am
most
heartily
sorry
for
awakening
you
at
this
ungodly
time
of
night
it
was
just
just
that
you
could
not
sleep
yourself
the
friar
laughed
but
it
is
a
most
godly
time
of
night
the
fact
is
i
would
have
had
to
get
up
soon
to
say
the
first
part
of
my
office
were
i
living
with
my
brother
franciscans
as
i
wish
i
were
i
would
be
up
chanting
lauds
with
them
but
i
fear
the
cardinal
will
be
neither
willing
nor
able
to
talk
to
us
if
we
go
to
him
now
so
much
damage
has
been
done
friar
mathieu
the
contessa
is
furious
i
could
not
begin
to
reason
with
her
she
went
on
and
on
talking
about
murderers
of
babies
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
tomorrow
morning
she
ordered
us
to
leave
her
palazzo
the
old
man
raised
a
hand
pope
urban
would
not
let
her
do
that
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
ambassadors
cardinal
le
gros
told
me
the
pope
looked
pale
and
shaken
when
he
left
he
might
not
care
whether
the
ambassadors
are
insulted
we
can
have
no
more
of
de
verceuil
blundering
friar
mathieu
shook
a
finger
at
him
what
happened
tonight
is
not
the
cardinal
doing
none
of
this
is
accidental
what
happened
tonight
shows
that
ugolini
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
block
this
alliance
but
ugolini
did
nothing
tonight
it
was
all
that
man
from
trebizond
that
is
like
saying
that
the
axe
chops
the
tree
down
and
not
the
woodsman
wielding
it
ugolini
brought
david
to
the
contessa
reception
he
brought
david
servant
an
accomplished
gambler
as
well
as
a
recruiter
of
brigosi
and
he
brought
his
niece
sophia
at
the
mention
of
sophia
a
sharp
pain
went
through
simon
chest
can
not
be
part
of
it
not
when
i
have
just
found
was
it
possible
that
the
passion
she
had
showed
in
their
time
together
in
the
atrium
was
a
sham
that
would
be
too
cruel
and
yet
how
could
he
prove
that
she
was
innocent
it
is
just
a
coincidence
that
sophia
is
here
in
orvieto
now
he
said
she
is
as
undecided
about
this
matter
of
the
tartars
as
the
pope
himself
is
is
the
pope
still
simon
wondered
as
he
spoke
the
wrinkles
around
friar
mathieu
faded
blue
eyes
deepened
a
little
well
i
would
not
expect
you
to
say
otherwise
a
knight
does
not
doubt
the
honor
of
a
lady
he
has
kissed
simon
sensed
friar
mathieu
skepticism
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
sophia
had
knowingly
been
the
cardinal
agent
this
woman
had
made
italy
a
place
of
enchantment
for
him
friar
mathieu
went
on
we
both
agree
do
we
not
that
the
luring
of
cardinal
de
verceuil
by
david
man
giancarlo
was
planned
by
ugolini
glad
to
be
on
safer
ground
simon
nodded
vigorously
we
agree
on
that
to
be
sure
but
we
can
not
simply
go
to
de
verceuil
as
you
proposed
and
denounce
him
for
having
left
the
room
with
giancarlo
not
when
he
can
at
once
point
out
that
you
also
left
the
room
with
sophia
simon
turned
his
back
on
friar
mathieu
and
stared
out
almost
unseeing
toward
the
window
it
had
neither
glass
nor
shutters
nor
parchment
only
a
gauze
curtain
to
discourage
insects
iron
bars
to
keep
out
larger
intruders
he
felt
furious
with
himself
the
mention
of
giancarlo
reminded
him
that
he
had
heard
nothing
from
sordello
by
now
the
old
mercenary
should
have
insinuated
himself
into
the
band
giancarlo
was
gathering
perhaps
through
sordello
simon
could
prove
sophia
innocence
he
noticed
now
that
some
light
was
coming
through
the
curtain
and
he
thought
he
heard
birds
singing
he
had
been
up
all
night
then
you
think
it
pointless
for
us
to
confront
de
verceuil
i
suppose
you
do
not
think
i
should
write
to
count
charles
either
i
think
it
very
unlikely
that
count
charles
would
give
the
responsibilities
in
this
to
someone
else
i
think
it
very
likely
that
cardinal
de
verceuil
has
his
intriguers
around
the
count
who
would
learn
of
your
message
and
might
set
themselves
to
do
you
harm
no
i
do
not
think
we
can
rid
ourselves
of
the
cardinal
but
i
agree
that
we
should
meet
with
him
simon
was
bewildered
to
do
what
friar
mathieu
shrugged
no
man
is
beyond
redemption
he
must
realize
that
because
of
his
blundering
tonight
our
blundering
the
mission
is
perilously
close
to
failing
perhaps
we
can
convince
him
that
in
the
future
we
must
work
together
otherwise
there
will
be
no
glory
for
him
to
steal
from
us
the
old
friar
had
been
sleeping
only
in
a
robe
of
gray
frieze
he
pulled
a
sleeveless
brown
mantle
over
his
head
and
tied
a
white
cord
around
his
waist
and
he
was
dressed
for
the
day
simon
envied
him
the
simplicity
of
his
apparel
it
took
him
a
good
deal
longer
to
dress
himself
in
the
morning
and
he
knew
noblemen
who
spent
hours
in
their
wardrobes
with
servants
to
help
them
before
they
felt
ready
to
face
the
world
we
will
go
now
then
he
asked
well
you
are
up
if
the
cardinal
is
as
upset
about
this
disaster
as
you
are
he
may
well
have
spent
a
sleepless
night
too
let
us
go
and
see
they
walked
side
by
side
down
dim
corridors
cluttered
with
battered
old
chairs
and
tables
past
walls
covered
with
tattered
hangings
dented
shields
and
rusty
coats
of
mail
the
monaldeschi
family
it
seemed
never
threw
away
anything
the
rooms
set
aside
for
the
cardinal
and
his
entourage
were
on
the
third
floor
of
the
palazzo
where
the
windows
were
larger
and
set
with
white
glass
a
man
wrapped
in
a
blanket
lay
on
a
sack
of
straw
outside
the
door
to
the
cardinal
rooms
the
top
of
his
head
shaved
in
a
tonsure
gleamed
dully
in
the
light
of
the
one
fat
candle
that
illuminated
the
corridor
a
cleric
in
minor
orders
no
doubt
simon
shook
him
no
your
signory
the
cleric
said
yawning
and
stretching
as
he
stood
up
to
bow
properly
to
the
count
the
cardinal
is
not
sleeping
but
neither
is
he
here
after
the
contessa
reception
he
and
the
tartars
and
their
guards
all
went
out
his
eminence
did
not
choose
to
tell
me
where
they
were
bound
simon
felt
the
wind
knocked
out
of
him
as
if
he
had
been
running
full
tilt
and
tripped
he
looked
at
friar
mathieu
who
wore
a
pained
even
sad
expression
after
everything
else
that
had
gone
wrong
how
could
de
verceuil
take
the
tartars
into
the
streets
late
at
night
they
might
run
afoul
of
bravos
or
some
of
the
wild
young
men
of
orvieto
feuding
families
why
would
de
verceuil
take
such
a
risk
then
simon
understood
the
reason
for
friar
mathieu
look
of
sadness
men
would
leave
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
at
this
hour
for
only
one
reason
loose
women
simon
had
heard
that
in
the
darkest
hours
a
corrupt
secret
world
glowed
brightly
in
orvieto
hidden
behind
discreet
walls
rumor
told
of
churchmen
who
ventured
behind
those
walls
indeed
it
was
said
that
the
secret
world
existed
because
of
the
patronage
of
such
men
of
course
de
verceuil
would
be
a
patron
of
that
sinful
night
world
and
of
course
he
would
draw
the
tartars
into
it
barbarians
that
they
were
they
no
doubt
expected
the
attentions
of
harlots
as
their
due
i
am
surprised
only
proves
i
suppose
what
a
bumpkin
i
thought
simon
annoyed
at
himself
and
disgusted
with
de
verceuil
he
must
pray
he
thought
with
a
chill
that
the
tartars
guards
were
well
armed
and
alert
xxv
swords
drawn
daoud
and
lorenzo
stood
in
the
shadowy
courtyard
lorenzo
faced
the
six
men
who
had
emerged
from
the
end
of
the
alley
and
were
now
fanning
out
to
surround
them
daoud
confronted
the
four
who
had
jumped
down
into
the
campiello
a
shutter
opened
on
the
overhanging
second
floor
of
a
house
and
daoud
glanced
up
to
see
a
face
the
shutter
slammed
with
a
finality
that
declared
the
householder
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
going
on
below
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
faces
of
the
men
before
him
they
wore
dark
capes
and
two
of
them
carried
long
daggers
in
one
hand
and
swords
in
the
other
one
shadowy
figure
stepped
forward
now
and
daoud
wondered
if
they
were
going
to
challenge
him
messere
let
us
speak
quickly
you
are
david
of
trebizond
are
you
not
the
man
had
asked
the
question
in
an
urgent
but
respectful
tone
feeling
a
bit
more
hopeful
daoud
answered
yes
i
am
david
who
the
devil
are
called
a
voice
from
behind
daoud
the
man
addressed
his
answer
to
daoud
i
am
andrea
sordello
of
rimini
messer
david
these
three
men
are
my
comrades
it
would
honor
us
if
you
would
accept
our
service
accept
his
service
lorenzo
said
at
once
from
behind
daoud
we
have
nothing
to
lose
daoud
made
himself
decide
at
once
if
you
are
willing
to
help
me
i
am
grateful
be
off
with
you
messer
sordello
called
one
of
the
original
pursuers
this
is
no
quarrel
of
yours
and
what
is
quarrel
with
these
men
sordello
replied
that
is
no
affair
of
yours
messere
it
was
the
voice
of
a
very
young
man
intense
passionate
daoud
turned
to
face
the
young
voice
at
once
sordello
moved
to
take
a
position
at
his
side
daoud
realized
that
he
could
see
better
the
first
hint
of
dawn
and
not
only
was
there
more
light
but
his
head
was
clearer
as
well
the
heat
of
his
body
aroused
to
fight
was
burning
away
the
intoxicating
spirits
in
his
blood
the
men
opposite
were
spread
far
apart
the
one
who
spoke
for
them
was
slender
and
wore
a
cap
that
fell
over
one
ear
a
silver
badge
glittered
on
the
cap
sordello
spoke
again
since
you
will
not
say
messere
i
will
tell
what
your
affair
is
you
are
of
the
famiglia
filippeschi
you
saw
these
gentlemen
leaving
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
and
decided
that
any
guest
of
the
monaldeschi
must
be
an
enemy
of
yours
and
so
you
decided
to
hunt
down
and
kill
these
good
gentlemen
who
have
done
you
no
harm
and
are
not
even
citizens
of
orvieto
for
the
offense
of
having
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
your
rivals
filippeschi
daoud
had
been
wanting
to
make
contact
with
them
ever
since
his
arrival
in
orvieto
now
he
had
met
them
and
accursed
luck
they
wanted
to
kill
him
lorenzo
they
are
filippeschi
he
muttered
talk
to
them
there
is
no
talking
to
messer
david
said
sordello
they
are
out
for
your
blood
be
still
said
daoud
the
man
had
offered
his
services
let
him
confine
himself
to
serving
then
lorenzo
stepped
out
in
front
of
daoud
his
sword
still
out
before
him
but
angled
toward
the
ground
messeres
at
least
you
should
know
who
it
is
that
you
have
set
out
to
kill
i
am
giancarlo
of
naples
and
this
is
my
master
david
he
is
a
merchant
from
trebizond
which
is
very
far
away
much
too
far
for
him
to
have
any
connection
with
the
quarrels
of
orvieto
one
of
the
filippeschi
bravos
a
short
man
standing
to
the
left
of
the
slender
leader
said
you
spin
a
tale
to
try
to
fool
us
anyone
can
see
your
master
is
a
frenchman
too
many
damned
french
in
italy
the
monaldeschi
are
toadies
of
the
french
death
to
the
monaldeschi
and
death
to
the
french
what
a
bitter
fate
it
would
be
daoud
thought
if
his
frankish
looks
which
caused
him
to
be
sent
here
earned
him
his
death
in
a
stupid
street
fight
there
are
six
of
you
said
lorenzo
but
now
that
these
four
men
have
joined
us
there
are
six
of
us
bad
odds
for
you
because
no
matter
how
much
you
harm
us
you
will
certainly
come
out
of
this
quarrel
worse
off
than
you
went
into
it
lowering
his
sword
even
more
he
stepped
closer
to
the
young
man
with
the
silver
badge
on
his
cap
signore
which
of
these
men
are
you
willing
to
lose
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
hurting
us
with
his
free
hand
he
pointed
from
man
to
man
in
the
circle
of
six
that
man
that
one
that
one
yourself
we
will
start
with
you
the
short
man
shouted
he
lunged
at
lorenzo
his
sword
thrusting
straight
for
lorenzo
chest
lorenzo
sword
was
up
in
an
instant
parrying
the
short
man
attack
at
the
same
moment
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
daoud
saw
arm
flash
up
then
down
the
short
man
gave
a
cry
and
stumbled
he
staggered
a
few
steps
then
collapsed
in
a
heap
at
the
feet
of
one
of
the
other
filippeschi
bravos
lorenzo
stepped
back
so
that
he
and
sordello
flanked
daoud
three
men
moved
up
beside
them
one
to
the
left
two
to
the
right
you
may
see
to
the
man
who
is
hurt
said
lorenzo
unless
you
want
to
continue
if
he
is
only
hurt
i
should
retire
to
a
monastery
sordello
laughed
indeed
daoud
saw
that
the
man
on
the
ground
was
not
moving
do
not
like
this
daoud
thought
comes
out
of
nowhere
wanting
to
work
for
me
he
kills
in
haste
and
boasts
about
the
young
man
with
the
silver
badge
on
his
cap
knelt
by
the
fallen
bravo
and
felt
under
his
cape
morte
he
said
harshly
and
stood
again
well
messeres
said
lorenzo
we
are
now
six
to
five
we
did
not
choose
to
quarrel
we
still
do
not
wish
to
fight
in
fact
we
ourselves
are
at
odds
with
the
monaldeschi
how
might
that
be
said
the
young
man
are
we
done
fighting
i
wish
to
make
a
proposal
to
you
the
filippeschi
spokesman
glanced
at
his
fellows
what
say
you
alfredo
was
my
cousin
said
a
tall
bravo
in
a
cape
but
i
can
not
avenge
him
alone
alfredo
was
impetuous
said
the
young
man
he
acted
before
i
gave
an
order
you
are
no
leader
marco
if
you
will
not
undertake
the
vendetta
for
one
of
your
men
vendetta
these
italians
are
like
the
desert
tribesmen
kill
one
of
them
and
you
have
his
family
to
deal
i
will
show
you
what
kind
of
a
leader
i
am
if
you
speak
that
way
to
me
again
said
marco
enough
enough
said
one
of
the
other
bravos
and
the
man
in
the
cape
shrugged
it
was
now
almost
daylight
and
daoud
studied
the
face
of
the
young
man
called
marco
he
could
not
be
more
than
seventeen
daoud
thought
looking
at
his
smooth
cheeks
and
downy
black
mustache
he
had
heard
that
the
head
of
the
filippeschi
family
was
a
young
conte
marco
di
filippeschi
what
do
you
propose
messere
said
marco
meet
me
in
front
of
the
church
of
sant
agnes
lorenzo
said
this
evening
at
compline
come
alone
as
i
will
there
are
things
we
can
discuss
i
think
to
our
mutual
profit
marco
bowed
to
lorenzo
i
shall
expect
you
messere
he
gestured
and
the
man
in
the
reddish
cape
and
one
other
picked
up
the
body
of
alfredo
momento
messeres
said
sordello
moving
to
the
body
in
three
quick
strides
he
bent
down
reached
under
the
body
and
with
a
jerk
of
his
hand
pulled
free
a
long
thin
throwing
knife
which
he
wiped
on
his
cape
i
can
ill
afford
to
lose
so
a
knife
as
this
alfredo
cousin
holding
the
body
by
the
shoulders
said
i
know
your
name
andrea
sordello
and
your
face
you
will
not
need
that
knife
much
longer
sordello
made
a
mock
bow
be
assured
messere
this
knife
will
not
miss
if
we
should
meet
again
a
moment
later
the
filippeschi
and
their
burden
had
disappeared
into
the
alley
daoud
studied
the
dark
irregular
stain
where
the
fallen
man
had
bled
on
the
paving
stones
of
the
campiello
it
was
dawn
already
past
fajr
the
time
for
morning
prayer
is
great
in
the
name
of
god
the
beneficent
the
merciful
all
praise
be
to
god
lord
of
the
i
advise
you
not
to
have
any
dealings
with
the
filippeschi
messeres
sordello
said
suddenly
they
betray
you
even
though
he
had
given
no
outward
sign
that
he
was
praying
daoud
was
angered
at
being
interrupted
he
eyed
sordello
the
man
was
shorter
than
he
about
fifty
years
of
age
daoud
judged
his
hair
was
a
good
deal
grayer
than
lorenzo
and
it
hung
lankly
down
to
his
jawline
under
a
shabby
maroon
cap
the
bones
of
sordello
nose
and
brows
were
thickened
and
flattened
as
if
they
had
been
broken
many
times
it
was
the
face
of
an
old
fighter
the
sort
of
face
that
usually
commanded
daoud
respect
be
it
borne
by
christian
or
muslim
but
when
daoud
looked
at
him
sordello
stared
back
fixedly
unnaturally
as
if
it
were
an
effort
to
look
daoud
in
the
eye
was
your
advice
asked
messere
lorenzo
growled
feels
about
the
man
as
i
daoud
thought
now
daoud
thought
sordello
would
bluster
about
saving
their
lives
and
he
would
ask
for
employment
forgive
me
sordello
said
i
presumed
too
much
he
pulled
off
his
cap
and
bowed
to
the
surprised
daoud
either
he
was
a
better
man
than
he
seemed
at
first
glance
or
he
was
much
more
devious
forgive
daoud
said
bowing
back
though
not
as
deeply
and
drawing
a
disapproving
grunt
from
lorenzo
we
owe
you
our
deepest
gratitude
how
came
you
leaping
down
from
the
housetops
when
we
needed
help
so
badly
i
have
been
looking
for
a
chance
to
meet
messer
giancarlo
tonight
i
waited
outside
the
monaldeschi
palace
hoping
that
you
would
emerge
from
the
reception
in
a
good
mood
while
i
and
my
fellows
were
hanging
about
the
palace
we
chanced
to
see
those
brigosi
lurking
in
the
shadows
nearby
when
you
came
out
it
was
you
they
chose
to
follow
so
we
followed
them
when
you
went
down
this
alley
we
took
to
the
rooftops
the
better
to
surprise
your
enemies
why
were
you
looking
for
me
lorenzo
asked
gruffly
i
heard
that
you
pay
well
for
men
who
are
adept
with
sword
and
dagger
and
who
ask
no
questions
about
what
they
might
be
hired
for
i
also
like
a
man
who
does
not
talk
much
said
lorenzo
you
talk
a
great
deal
yes
messer
giancarlo
sordello
lowered
his
eyes
again
that
disarming
humility
the
man
was
resourceful
and
he
was
arrogant
one
moment
humble
the
next
how
did
you
come
to
orvieto
sordello
daoud
asked
him
i
served
sigismundo
malatesta
governor
of
rimini
until
his
death
said
sordello
since
then
i
have
not
found
a
suitable
master
i
was
traveling
south
thinking
perhaps
of
offering
my
sword
to
king
manfred
when
i
heard
of
you
messer
giancarlo
while
passing
through
viterbo
daoud
felt
uneasy
hearing
that
lorenzo
recruiting
expeditions
were
being
gossiped
of
in
the
cities
around
here
and
how
easily
sordello
had
been
able
to
make
the
connection
between
giancarlo
and
david
of
trebizond
just
as
tilia
had
said
it
was
impossible
to
hire
men
without
attracting
attention
he
realized
lorenzo
was
waiting
for
him
to
speak
you
may
walk
with
us
to
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
daoud
said
when
they
emerged
from
the
alley
there
was
no
sign
of
the
filippeschi
two
of
sordello
men
walked
in
front
of
daoud
and
lorenzo
and
sordello
and
the
other
man
followed
behind
them
the
wine
had
worn
off
altogether
but
daoud
felt
a
throbbing
pain
behind
his
eyes
and
a
great
need
to
sleep
well
lorenzo
said
keeping
his
voice
low
the
man
wants
us
to
hire
him
we
need
more
men
and
we
want
clever
street
fighters
said
daoud
he
is
that
yes
but
he
is
the
type
of
man
i
detest
said
lorenzo
i
did
not
need
him
to
kill
that
filippeschi
bravo
for
me
he
acts
before
he
thinks
after
tonight
we
may
not
have
to
attack
the
french
directly
daoud
said
on
the
other
hand
we
are
sure
to
have
further
need
of
bodyguards
and
i
think
sordello
and
his
three
companions
would
suit
let
us
give
ourselves
time
to
think
tell
him
you
will
meet
him
and
give
him
our
answer
in
two
days
xxvi
it
could
not
be
worse
rachel
thought
she
could
not
be
more
degraded
an
old
man
and
a
tartar
were
the
tartars
even
human
she
wondered
or
was
she
about
to
commit
the
further
abominable
sin
of
mating
with
an
animal
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
with
a
terribly
final
sound
and
he
was
standing
in
front
of
it
showing
his
teeth
large
and
strong
and
very
white
in
a
broad
grin
she
wondered
if
he
could
see
her
knees
and
hands
trembling
if
only
she
had
accepted
signora
tilia
offer
to
release
her
from
this
was
it
too
late
could
she
rush
past
the
tartar
to
the
door
and
pull
it
open
and
run
away
if
she
did
that
now
doubtless
the
tartar
would
be
insulted
from
what
she
knew
about
these
creatures
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
make
him
angry
will
pretend
to
be
sick
when
he
is
not
looking
i
will
stick
my
finger
down
my
throat
and
throw
up
that
will
disgust
him
so
he
will
leave
me
or
it
might
antagonize
him
enough
to
kill
her
her
body
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
her
eyes
were
shut
but
she
heard
the
monster
coming
closer
she
thought
of
what
he
would
do
to
her
and
her
stomach
heaved
she
would
throw
up
even
without
trying
to
she
hoped
he
kill
her
better
that
than
his
animal
thing
inside
her
she
opened
her
eyes
to
see
that
he
had
stopped
halfway
between
the
closed
door
and
the
bed
actually
he
was
not
so
hideous
he
had
a
round
brown
face
and
bright
black
eyes
and
his
beard
was
white
as
angelo
had
been
rachel
rachel
the
joy
of
my
old
angelo
would
say
beard
was
white
before
you
were
would
not
rejoice
in
his
old
age
if
he
could
see
me
the
tartar
beard
and
mustache
were
not
full
and
flowing
as
had
been
but
stringy
the
beard
almost
seemed
like
a
false
beard
pasted
on
that
small
sharp
chin
he
said
buona
sera
berra
feeria
he
had
learned
some
italian
but
it
was
not
evening
it
was
almost
morning
and
what
was
he
trying
to
say
bella
figlia
beautiful
daughter
he
had
probably
asked
someone
what
he
should
say
and
they
had
told
him
the
wrong
things
buona
sera
mio
signore
she
answered
inclining
her
head
slightly
her
voice
was
a
terrified
whisper
when
she
heard
how
frightened
she
sounded
she
became
more
frightened
still
and
huddled
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
bed
wishing
she
could
squeeze
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
beside
her
and
disappear
the
tartar
tapped
his
chest
smiling
and
nodding
john
he
wore
a
crimson
silk
tunic
that
fell
to
his
knees
and
over
it
a
pale
green
gown
open
in
front
with
wide
sleeves
when
she
had
stood
by
a
window
in
the
cardinal
palazzo
and
watched
the
tartars
arrival
in
orvieto
he
and
the
other
tartar
had
worn
silk
robes
blood
red
covered
with
blue
birds
with
long
golden
tails
now
he
was
dressed
like
an
italian
he
was
still
nodding
at
her
with
a
questioning
look
on
his
face
he
wanted
her
to
say
her
name
rachel
she
said
touching
her
chest
how
small
her
breasts
were
she
thought
he
could
not
possibly
want
a
girl
with
such
small
breasts
he
certainly
would
not
want
to
devour
them
she
felt
sick
to
her
stomach
again
reicho
buona
sera
reicho
he
could
not
pronounce
the
letter
buona
sera
john
she
answered
she
was
about
to
smile
but
she
checked
herself
if
she
seemed
to
be
encouraging
him
he
would
come
at
her
cold
sweat
broke
out
over
her
skin
is
going
to
come
at
me
a
silver
pitcher
of
wine
with
two
silver
goblets
stood
on
a
small
table
beside
the
bed
wine
might
make
this
easier
for
her
except
that
too
much
wine
would
make
her
sick
well
was
that
not
what
she
wanted
she
stretched
a
trembling
hand
toward
it
will
you
take
some
wine
messer
john
on
earth
did
he
get
a
name
like
john
she
poured
the
wine
carefully
filling
the
goblets
only
full
so
her
trembling
hands
would
not
spill
their
contents
the
tartar
crossed
the
room
and
sat
in
the
chair
tilia
had
occupied
a
short
while
earlier
rachel
held
out
a
goblet
to
him
and
her
hand
shook
so
badly
she
almost
dropped
it
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
maybe
he
was
used
to
being
waited
on
by
trembling
women
he
smiled
and
nodded
tilia
was
watching
all
this
rachel
remembered
she
drained
her
cup
quickly
the
silver
giving
the
wine
a
slightly
metallic
taste
she
poured
a
second
cup
for
herself
and
looked
at
him
he
barely
sipped
from
his
goblet
before
setting
it
on
the
table
holding
his
hand
palm
down
over
it
too
bad
she
thought
she
had
heard
that
men
who
drank
too
much
could
not
get
stiff
enough
to
go
into
women
john
started
talking
to
her
in
his
own
tongue
he
spoke
for
a
long
time
with
many
gestures
some
toward
himself
some
toward
her
she
tried
desperately
to
guess
what
he
was
saying
she
did
not
want
to
respond
the
wrong
way
and
anger
him
he
seemed
quite
at
ease
and
he
laughed
occasionally
as
if
he
were
telling
her
funny
stories
that
amused
him
as
well
she
saw
webs
of
fine
wrinkles
in
the
brown
skin
around
his
eyes
and
thought
could
be
older
than
he
began
to
make
a
strange
sound
a
moan
perhaps
he
was
in
pain
perhaps
was
going
to
be
sick
her
heart
leapt
hopefully
then
the
moan
changed
pitch
and
his
mouth
began
to
shape
words
they
must
be
tartar
words
he
was
singing
to
her
it
was
unmistakably
a
song
but
it
was
strange
and
shrill
to
her
ears
she
almost
burst
out
laughing
but
immediately
felt
terror
at
the
thought
of
offending
him
it
began
to
dawn
on
her
though
that
john
was
not
behaving
like
a
brute
as
she
had
feared
he
would
when
she
first
saw
him
in
the
doorway
if
she
looked
behind
the
black
slits
that
were
his
eyes
under
the
skin
he
seemed
a
pleasant
old
man
his
language
might
be
gibberish
to
her
but
it
was
clear
that
he
was
trying
to
entertain
her
even
woo
her
but
she
hated
the
thought
of
what
he
was
trying
to
woo
her
he
ended
his
song
by
clapping
his
hands
rhythmically
she
counted
nine
handclaps
he
followed
that
with
more
eager
smiles
and
nods
he
actually
wanted
to
know
whether
she
liked
his
song
she
relaxed
a
bit
she
smiled
and
nodded
back
yes
very
good
john
che
bello
perhaps
she
could
get
him
to
sing
more
and
put
off
the
moment
she
dreaded
but
he
stood
up
with
a
look
on
his
face
that
froze
her
heart
in
her
chest
there
was
nothing
ferocious
or
cruel
in
it
or
even
lustful
there
was
neither
kindness
nor
pity
in
it
nor
anything
that
recognized
her
as
a
person
it
was
the
satisfied
smile
of
a
man
looking
upon
a
possession
he
slipped
off
the
gown
and
unbuckled
his
belt
she
began
to
tremble
uncontrollably
daoud
sat
slumped
with
exhaustion
on
the
carpeted
floor
of
cabinet
the
long
night
just
past
had
drained
him
of
all
his
energy
he
wanted
to
sleep
but
first
he
must
see
to
it
that
ugolini
made
good
use
of
the
advantage
they
had
gained
at
the
contessa
reception
a
strong
rich
familiar
smell
filtered
into
his
nostrils
and
his
head
lifted
as
if
a
powerful
hand
had
gripped
it
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
carried
in
a
tray
laden
with
six
small
porcelain
cups
one
each
for
ugolini
daoud
sophia
and
lorenzo
and
two
extra
as
well
as
two
pitchers
ugolini
pushed
aside
a
pile
of
parchment
on
his
work
table
and
the
servant
set
the
tray
down
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
servant
daoud
drew
a
deep
breath
to
identify
the
smell
and
felt
a
glow
of
surprised
pleasure
is
it
possible
he
said
to
ugolini
you
have
found
kaviyeh
ugolini
sitting
in
the
big
chair
behind
his
work
table
just
his
head
and
shoulders
showing
smiled
benignly
you
may
hate
the
tartars
for
invading
the
islamic
lands
my
friend
but
it
means
that
we
christians
can
now
trade
with
that
part
of
the
world
the
venetians
have
been
importing
the
beans
from
the
uplands
of
persia
in
small
and
very
expensive
quantities
i
was
saving
this
for
a
special
occasion
this
morning
after
your
triumph
over
the
tartars
and
your
narrow
escape
from
death
seemed
appropriate
daoud
found
the
strength
to
stand
up
and
pour
the
steaming
black
liquid
from
the
pitcher
into
a
cup
he
held
the
cup
to
his
face
with
both
hands
and
sniffed
deeply
he
felt
happier
than
he
had
in
a
long
time
sophia
sitting
on
a
padded
bench
against
the
wall
opposite
table
said
what
is
that
daoud
heard
shrill
alarm
in
her
voice
she
must
suspect
it
was
some
sort
of
drug
thought
daoud
with
amusement
the
cardinal
chuckled
amiably
only
a
beverage
my
dear
long
used
in
the
orient
by
sages
and
poets
it
produces
a
heightened
state
of
alertness
and
vigor
daoud
sipped
the
hot
liquid
the
taste
was
wondrously
bracing
after
months
of
deprivation
but
it
was
not
quite
strong
enough
this
is
very
good
and
i
am
your
grateful
slave
forever
he
said
but
you
should
tell
your
servants
to
boil
it
longer
having
sensed
that
sophia
feared
his
pleasure
he
wanted
to
share
it
with
her
that
she
might
see
how
harmless
it
was
he
went
to
her
and
held
out
his
cup
try
this
be
careful
the
cup
is
hot
she
took
the
cup
from
him
her
fingers
brushing
his
he
felt
a
tingle
in
his
arm
she
raised
the
cup
sniffed
suspiciously
and
grimaced
but
took
a
small
sip
he
was
disappointed
to
see
her
mouth
pucker
she
did
not
like
it
well
he
could
not
expect
her
to
take
to
it
at
once
he
had
been
drinking
it
ever
since
he
was
a
child
even
his
crusader
family
had
drunk
kaviyeh
a
very
interesting
taste
she
said
handing
back
the
cup
a
byzantine
comment
he
thought
he
heard
lorenzo
chuckle
a
pang
of
jealousy
shot
through
him
he
could
not
expect
her
to
like
kaviyeh
any
more
than
he
could
expect
her
to
love
him
especially
not
after
she
had
been
alone
in
the
monaldeschi
atrium
with
that
damned
french
count
his
longing
for
sophia
made
his
heart
ache
if
only
he
could
have
her
for
himself
and
not
be
forced
to
throw
her
at
simon
de
gobignon
but
she
was
no
more
his
than
that
emerald
baibars
had
entrusted
to
him
resignedly
he
told
himself
he
must
find
out
what
she
had
accomplished
how
did
you
deal
with
the
frankish
count
as
you
wished
me
to
he
walked
back
to
the
cardinal
table
and
turned
to
face
her
her
amber
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
she
must
have
been
watching
him
cross
the
room
does
he
want
to
see
you
again
david
demanded
she
shrugged
he
did
when
i
left
him
but
by
now
he
and
cardinal
de
verceuil
will
have
talked
together
and
may
well
realize
my
part
in
what
we
did
to
them
well
said
ugolini
rubbing
his
hands
together
there
will
be
no
more
need
for
you
to
pursue
count
simon
my
dear
or
for
messer
lorenzo
to
play
backgammon
with
the
french
cardinal
and
no
need
for
our
illustrious
david
to
risk
further
verbal
jousting
with
the
tartars
daoud
felt
a
stab
of
exasperation
just
as
he
had
feared
ugolini
wanted
to
believe
that
with
last
night
triumph
over
the
tartars
their
work
was
done
would
he
be
able
to
persuade
the
cardinal
to
realize
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
a
long
struggle
one
in
which
he
ugolini
must
play
the
chief
part
de
verceuil
is
a
clever
but
sloppy
player
lorenzo
interjected
he
kept
leaving
blots
less
than
six
points
away
from
me
but
i
managed
to
lose
eighty
florins
to
him
that
kept
him
interested
once
he
decided
i
was
not
a
skillful
player
he
kept
doubling
the
stakes
and
pressing
me
to
do
the
same
when
the
choice
was
mine
he
went
over
to
ugolini
work
table
and
poured
himself
a
cup
of
kaviyeh
ugolini
laughed
he
must
now
think
his
winnings
eighty
costly
florins
indeed
he
filled
a
cup
from
another
pitcher
sprang
up
and
carried
the
cup
across
the
room
to
sophia
you
will
enjoy
this
spiced
milk
more
than
the
muslim
kaviyeh
it
is
my
favorite
morning
drink
you
think
it
is
all
over
then
cardinal
daoud
growled
i
can
go
away
and
leave
you
in
peace
and
richer
from
the
suddenly
outraged
face
ugolini
turned
toward
him
daoud
thought
the
cardinal
might
well
be
wishing
the
filippeschi
had
finished
him
off
was
last
night
not
a
victory
the
cardinal
asked
in
a
choked
voice
do
you
know
the
difference
between
winning
a
battle
and
winning
a
war
what
more
can
the
french
do
said
ugolini
we
must
talk
about
that
said
daoud
even
though
in
spite
of
this
good
kaviyeh
my
body
screams
for
rest
he
drained
the
cup
put
it
down
and
stretched
his
arms
with
difficulty
he
brought
his
anger
under
control
he
must
win
ugolini
not
turn
him
into
an
enemy
ugolini
had
sat
down
in
the
chair
behind
his
work
table
his
slender
fingers
restlessly
polished
the
dome
of
the
skull
with
the
diagram
painted
on
its
cranium
that
lay
before
him
he
looked
as
gloomy
as
if
he
were
contemplating
the
day
when
he
himself
would
be
reduced
to
bones
lorenzo
quietly
got
up
and
poured
himself
another
cup
of
kaviyeh
daoud
turned
to
sophia
how
do
you
think
de
gobignon
feels
toward
you
he
hated
to
ask
the
question
he
watched
her
face
closely
what
he
really
wanted
to
know
was
how
felt
about
de
gobignon
her
eyes
were
even
with
senses
he
could
not
guess
what
was
behind
that
damnably
unrevealing
mask
i
think
i
persuaded
him
that
the
cardinal
niece
neither
knows
nor
cares
anything
about
alliances
and
crusades
i
believe
he
could
come
to
love
me
rage
throbbed
in
his
temples
what
in
his
sheltered
existence
could
the
young
count
have
learned
of
love
love
you
unlikely
daoud
challenged
her
he
saw
with
quick
regret
that
he
had
hurt
her
feelings
she
recoiled
as
if
struck
do
you
not
think
me
worthy
of
a
nobleman
love
daoud
crossed
the
room
in
three
quick
steps
and
stood
over
her
such
pampered
creatures
as
he
are
not
capable
of
love
the
mask
was
back
she
shrugged
love
or
lust
he
is
drawn
to
me
do
you
mean
to
make
some
use
of
it
send
him
a
note
by
one
of
the
cardinal
servants
asking
him
to
meet
with
you
in
a
few
days
time
daoud
turned
and
walked
to
the
celestial
globe
beside
ugolini
table
and
spun
it
absently
as
he
studied
sophia
let
him
pick
the
place
so
he
feels
secure
again
he
had
a
glimpse
through
the
mask
her
eyes
widened
in
fear
she
thought
he
meant
to
kill
de
gobignon
that
angered
him
did
she
care
so
much
for
the
frenchman
then
that
his
possible
death
made
her
lose
her
composure
to
daoud
surprise
ugolini
jumped
from
his
chair
and
advanced
on
him
shaking
his
finger
and
crying
all
of
france
will
be
down
on
us
like
an
avalanche
if
you
harm
that
boy
daoud
checked
an
impulse
to
laugh
ugolini
was
such
a
comical
figure
in
the
flapping
white
robe
he
had
donned
on
returning
to
his
mansion
to
daoud
who
had
lived
most
of
his
life
among
men
for
whom
death
was
as
common
as
fear
was
rare
the
little
man
tendency
to
panic
seemed
contemptible
but
anew
he
reminded
himself
that
he
needed
ugolini
and
must
treat
him
with
respect
please
your
eminence
he
said
if
i
meant
to
have
de
gobignon
killed
i
would
not
involve
sophia
i
want
her
to
tell
him
what
we
are
supposedly
doing
i
hope
to
create
conflict
among
the
supporters
of
the
alliance
but
sophia
takes
a
great
risk
meeting
with
him
said
ugolini
what
if
de
gobignon
attempts
to
force
the
truth
out
of
her
the
thought
of
de
gobignon
laying
violent
hands
on
sophia
angered
daoud
and
he
spoke
impulsively
i
will
kill
him
god
help
us
ugolini
went
back
to
his
work
table
and
sat
down
behind
it
his
hands
over
his
face
at
once
daoud
regretted
what
he
had
said
but
was
there
no
way
to
instill
courage
into
this
man
there
is
much
work
for
you
to
do
cardinal
he
said
you
must
not
falter
now
then
let
there
be
no
more
talk
of
killing
said
ugolini
fiercely
taking
his
hands
from
his
face
daoud
poured
himself
another
cup
of
kaviyeh
and
stood
looking
down
at
ugolini
with
so
much
at
stake
surely
you
know
i
would
not
do
anything
rash
you
need
not
think
of
ugolini
said
a
plea
in
his
eyes
as
long
as
the
pope
delays
his
decision
about
the
tartars
your
people
are
safe
true
enough
daoud
thought
delay
was
a
large
part
of
his
mission
but
despite
what
ugolini
might
think
it
was
not
enough
for
the
safety
of
islam
an
alliance
between
tartars
and
christians
must
be
made
impossible
your
eminence
will
it
please
you
to
visit
the
cardinals
who
heard
the
tartars
condemn
themselves
last
night
he
tried
not
to
make
it
sound
like
an
order
i
see
no
need
for
that
said
ugolini
of
course
daoud
thought
the
little
cardinal
mind
was
so
full
of
fear
that
he
could
not
see
at
all
but
i
am
hoping
that
you
can
organize
a
delegation
of
cardinals
to
go
to
the
pope
and
urge
him
to
give
up
the
idea
of
an
alliance
with
the
tartars
after
all
you
are
the
cardinal
camerlengo
your
word
has
weight
ugolini
made
a
bridge
of
his
interlaced
fingers
and
rested
his
forehead
against
them
as
if
his
head
ached
i
have
attacked
the
tartars
at
the
pope
council
he
spoke
down
at
his
table
barely
loud
enough
for
daoud
to
hear
him
i
have
introduced
you
into
the
highest
circles
in
orvieto
i
have
let
you
recruit
criminals
and
instigate
riots
while
you
live
in
my
mansion
i
hear
you
plotting
murder
he
looked
up
suddenly
basta
enough
despair
made
daoud
feel
weak
he
knew
this
sick
feeling
came
partly
from
being
awake
all
night
poisoning
himself
with
and
nearly
getting
himself
murdered
he
told
himself
it
did
not
matter
how
he
felt
he
was
and
could
control
his
feelings
he
was
a
mameluke
and
must
remain
on
the
attack
but
he
chose
not
to
meet
ugolini
refusal
directly
i
also
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
persuade
fra
tomasso
to
write
an
open
letter
to
the
pope
or
to
the
king
of
france
denouncing
the
tartars
copies
of
the
letter
can
be
circulated
to
men
of
influence
throughout
christendom
ugolini
shook
his
head
whiskers
fluttering
fra
tomasso
is
neutral
and
wants
to
stay
that
way
if
i
can
i
intend
to
push
fra
tomasso
away
from
his
surely
he
could
not
have
failed
to
be
moved
by
what
he
heard
last
night
said
daoud
i
could
see
that
he
was
it
will
take
more
than
one
incident
to
move
fra
tomasso
said
ugolini
i
have
him
daoud
glanced
at
lorenzo
who
nodded
encouragingly
daoud
leaned
forward
pressing
both
hands
on
the
table
there
you
yourself
have
said
the
very
thing
i
have
been
trying
to
tell
you
last
night
was
just
one
incident
it
was
not
enough
to
move
fra
tomasso
the
cardinals
the
pope
we
must
do
more
you
can
accomplish
everything
we
want
by
persuasion
and
cunning
and
subterfuge
if
you
do
i
will
never
have
to
put
my
hand
to
my
dagger
and
you
will
have
nothing
to
fear
he
shook
his
open
hand
at
ugolini
take
the
lead
yourself
ugolini
sat
staring
at
the
skull
while
daoud
held
his
breath
the
little
cardinal
pulled
at
his
whiskers
and
looked
up
at
daoud
what
must
i
do
daoud
let
his
breath
out
strength
surged
back
into
his
body
and
despair
fled
before
it
tell
me
he
said
if
fra
tomasso
were
to
turn
against
the
tartars
what
do
you
think
the
franks
would
do
about
it
ugolini
frowned
i
think
that
then
the
only
way
to
reach
him
would
be
through
the
dominicans
if
his
superiors
commanded
him
to
change
his
opinion
on
the
tartars
or
to
be
silent
he
would
have
to
obey
and
who
of
the
alliance
chief
supporters
would
speak
to
the
dominican
order
for
the
french
daoud
pressed
count
simon
lacks
the
authority
ugolini
said
friar
mathieu
is
eloquent
and
knows
the
tartars
well
but
i
can
not
imagine
that
the
chief
dominicans
would
pay
any
attention
to
an
ordinary
franciscan
priest
what
of
de
verceuil
daoud
asked
ugolini
nodded
as
a
cardinal
de
verceuil
can
speak
as
an
equal
to
the
head
of
the
dominican
order
good
said
daoud
that
is
what
i
hoped
you
would
tell
me
he
turned
away
from
ugolini
he
had
accomplished
as
much
as
he
could
for
the
moment
exhaustion
struck
him
like
a
mace
on
the
back
of
his
head
lorenzo
when
you
meet
that
bravo
sordello
tell
him
that
i
have
decided
he
and
the
three
with
him
can
join
us
i
am
going
to
bed
i
have
a
bad
feeling
about
him
said
lorenzo
daoud
paused
to
consider
this
it
was
precisely
for
such
advice
that
he
needed
lorenzo
he
put
his
hand
on
lorenzo
shoulder
if
he
is
spying
on
us
we
need
to
know
who
sought
to
place
him
in
our
camp
let
him
feel
he
is
secure
with
us
then
start
keeping
a
close
watch
on
him
see
to
whom
he
leads
us
daoud
turned
from
lorenzo
to
look
at
sophia
she
was
looking
at
him
intently
but
he
could
not
tell
what
she
was
thinking
or
feeling
tired
as
he
was
he
wished
she
would
come
to
bed
with
him
if
only
she
were
willing
if
only
he
could
invite
her
rachel
lay
with
her
face
to
the
wall
crying
silently
she
wanted
not
to
weep
because
she
was
still
afraid
of
offending
the
tartar
even
though
it
was
all
over
she
realized
that
her
gown
was
still
above
her
waist
and
she
lifted
her
hips
to
pull
it
down
but
what
was
the
point
of
modesty
for
her
anymore
especially
with
this
man
who
had
taken
her
virginity
she
heard
the
rustling
of
silk
as
he
dressed
behind
her
he
had
not
taken
all
of
his
clothes
off
just
enough
to
bare
his
member
it
had
been
smaller
than
she
imagined
once
in
a
stable
in
perugia
a
boy
had
shown
himself
to
her
and
tried
to
rape
her
but
she
had
run
away
that
stableboy
thing
had
been
much
bigger
john
said
something
to
her
but
she
understood
only
his
reicho
he
was
probably
telling
her
to
stop
crying
even
though
he
had
been
kindly
before
getting
into
the
bed
with
her
she
had
expected
that
he
would
become
like
the
wild
savage
tartars
she
had
heard
about
his
weight
on
top
of
her
even
though
he
was
a
small
man
had
frightened
her
but
he
had
entered
her
slowly
and
stopped
and
waited
when
she
cried
out
in
the
end
it
had
been
she
wanting
in
desperation
to
get
it
over
with
who
finished
the
piercing
by
pressing
upward
with
her
hips
his
few
quick
thrusts
and
his
shout
of
pleasure
a
horseman
yell
followed
in
a
moment
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
she
sobbed
aloud
suddenly
and
bit
into
the
pillow
the
thought
that
her
whole
future
had
been
decided
by
a
moment
that
had
not
lasted
even
as
long
as
it
takes
to
light
a
candle
was
too
much
to
bear
would
say
i
am
not
a
good
woman
the
tartar
spoke
again
and
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
his
voice
was
soft
and
kind
quieting
her
sobs
with
one
last
deep
shuddering
sigh
she
rolled
over
to
look
at
him
more
smiles
and
nods
from
him
yes
he
wanted
to
cheer
her
up
she
sensed
that
he
knew
something
about
women
and
what
he
knew
had
come
not
just
from
rapes
committed
on
the
battlefield
he
must
have
a
wife
in
the
faraway
land
he
came
from
and
he
must
long
ago
have
done
to
that
wife
what
he
had
just
done
to
rachel
more
than
one
wife
she
reminded
herself
and
more
than
one
deflowering
because
according
to
tilia
the
tartars
took
several
wives
as
the
muslims
did
he
was
probably
a
grandfather
many
times
over
back
in
that
land
he
stood
beside
the
bed
fully
dressed
he
had
even
tucked
back
and
knotted
his
hair
behind
his
head
his
grin
broadened
when
she
looked
at
him
rachel
had
not
seen
a
jewish
or
a
christian
man
as
old
as
john
with
such
good
teeth
he
untied
a
small
bag
from
his
belt
he
held
it
out
to
her
should
she
take
it
of
course
she
should
was
not
getting
paid
the
whole
point
of
what
she
had
just
gone
through
was
not
money
what
her
body
was
to
be
traded
for
from
now
on
thank
you
messer
john
she
said
and
reached
out
her
hand
but
he
came
closer
and
rubbed
the
soft
leather
of
the
bag
against
her
cheeks
to
dry
her
tears
she
understood
what
he
was
trying
to
tell
her
that
this
money
should
pay
her
for
her
pain
being
a
pagan
he
could
not
understand
the
greater
pain
of
her
soul
because
she
had
sinned
because
she
had
shamed
her
family
and
dishonored
herself
forever
i
have
no
family
none
living
that
is
why
i
am
john
put
the
bag
into
her
hand
and
closed
her
fingers
over
it
then
pushed
her
hand
against
her
chest
the
bag
was
very
heavy
for
its
small
size
he
frowned
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
and
waved
his
hand
he
was
trying
to
tell
her
she
thought
that
this
was
a
special
present
for
her
that
she
was
not
to
tell
madama
tilia
about
it
he
did
not
know
that
tilia
had
been
watching
everything
they
had
done
together
he
pressed
the
callused
palm
of
his
hand
against
her
cheek
and
said
something
then
turned
and
quickly
walked
out
of
the
room
and
rachel
was
alone
with
her
desolation
she
wanted
to
sleep
there
were
no
windows
in
this
room
but
it
must
have
been
morning
by
now
she
realized
that
she
did
not
feel
sleepy
although
she
was
tired
she
felt
a
dull
ache
down
inside
herself
where
he
had
broken
the
seal
of
her
virginity
the
bag
of
money
lay
heavy
in
her
lap
perhaps
if
she
drank
some
wine
it
would
help
her
sleep
she
heard
men
voices
loud
and
rough
in
other
parts
of
the
house
a
man
laughed
and
then
a
woman
laughed
how
many
men
had
come
with
the
tartar
she
felt
too
tired
even
to
crawl
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
pour
herself
the
wine
she
picked
up
the
money
and
pushed
it
under
a
pillow
perhaps
tilia
had
not
seen
him
give
it
to
her
she
had
done
this
for
money
and
she
ought
to
get
as
much
as
she
could
for
it
the
door
swung
open
and
tilia
was
standing
there
her
wide
mouth
stretched
in
a
broad
smile
and
her
hands
rose
in
benediction
you
were
just
what
he
wanted
he
seemed
most
pleased
rachel
tried
to
smile
it
was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
tilia
shrugged
men
who
are
terrible
in
warfare
are
sometimes
kinder
in
bed
i
thought
his
zipolo
rather
small
did
you
not
that
was
lucky
for
you
rachel
felt
her
face
grow
hot
i
have
seen
only
one
other
when
it
was
hard
like
that
and
it
bigger
well
said
tilia
small
as
this
tartar
was
he
was
able
to
mount
you
twice
and
that
is
remarkable
for
a
man
who
has
been
up
drinking
all
night
then
she
laughed
ah
but
you
should
have
seen
the
french
cardinal
who
came
here
with
this
tartar
he
asked
for
three
women
and
he
swived
each
one
of
them
mightily
those
french
i
care
not
for
their
airs
but
they
are
a
lusty
lot
rachel
felt
herself
smiling
was
it
so
easy
to
begin
to
think
like
a
whore
and
laugh
at
whores
jokes
well
said
tilia
we
must
get
you
washed
out
at
once
you
do
not
want
to
be
giving
birth
to
a
little
tartar
in
your
first
year
as
a
woman
do
you
she
went
to
a
cabinet
and
drew
out
a
bladder
with
a
tube
coiled
beside
it
if
you
have
never
seen
one
before
said
tilia
but
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
it
does
not
hurt
we
just
fill
the
pig
stomach
with
warm
water
and
squeeze
it
and
the
water
goes
through
the
vellum
tube
and
up
inside
you
the
women
of
rome
used
them
centuries
ago
when
they
did
not
want
to
get
pregnant
i
suppose
that
is
why
the
barbarians
finally
overran
italy
rachel
looked
at
the
thing
tilia
laid
on
the
bed
beside
her
and
felt
sick
oh
by
the
way
said
tilia
as
she
went
back
to
the
cabinet
and
got
out
a
basin
and
a
pitcher
i
will
let
you
keep
the
purse
he
gave
you
he
looked
so
happy
when
he
left
here
i
think
you
deserve
it
the
tartar
could
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
thought
rachel
but
she
must
stay
even
now
with
over
five
hundred
florins
more
money
than
she
had
ever
had
in
her
life
she
was
alone
she
knew
how
to
travel
she
had
traveled
for
two
years
with
angelo
but
she
also
knew
the
terrors
and
dangers
of
the
road
dangers
that
ultimately
had
killed
angelo
the
best
she
could
hope
for
was
to
endure
this
life
for
a
year
or
two
get
what
she
could
from
it
let
it
make
her
rich
when
she
did
leave
she
would
have
enough
money
to
hire
guards
to
accompany
her
she
would
make
up
an
elaborate
story
about
her
past
she
would
go
where
no
one
knew
her
sicily
perhaps
and
begin
a
new
life
as
a
wealthy
woman
venturing
into
banking
or
trading
for
herself
the
hope
of
a
wealthy
new
life
that
was
the
raft
that
would
bear
her
up
when
she
felt
she
must
drown
in
sorrow
xxvii
daoud
tired
eyes
burned
he
shut
them
as
he
entered
his
bedchamber
against
the
bright
light
coming
through
the
white
window
glass
but
tired
as
he
was
sleep
did
not
come
perhaps
he
was
too
tired
he
had
missed
the
proper
time
for
morning
prayer
but
he
poured
water
into
a
basin
and
washed
his
hands
and
face
then
turned
toward
the
risen
sun
and
humbly
addressed
god
first
bowing
then
kneeling
then
striking
his
forehead
on
the
carpet
i
pray
i
am
at
home
no
matter
where
i
after
praying
he
pushed
open
the
iron
casement
with
its
glass
panels
to
let
in
air
and
then
pulled
the
green
velvet
curtains
across
the
window
to
shut
out
light
he
moved
now
in
a
cool
dimness
as
if
underwater
he
must
rest
to
be
strong
for
the
next
battle
crossing
the
room
to
his
sleeping
mattress
which
lay
on
the
floor
he
stripped
off
his
tunic
and
threw
it
down
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
laid
it
carefully
on
the
mattress
then
he
kicked
off
his
boots
and
dropped
his
hose
and
his
loincloth
he
splashed
water
over
his
body
and
felt
cleaner
and
cooler
there
was
another
way
to
be
home
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
first
time
he
could
feel
he
had
triumphed
he
knew
all
too
well
what
that
way
could
do
to
a
man
in
the
aftermath
of
defeat
sharpen
his
misery
till
he
could
ease
the
pain
only
by
destroying
himself
but
last
night
he
had
unmasked
the
tartars
before
all
the
great
ones
of
orvieto
and
he
had
survived
a
street
encounter
with
bravos
who
intended
to
kill
him
and
so
this
morning
he
could
allow
himself
this
he
had
brought
a
cup
of
kaviyeh
from
ugolini
room
he
set
it
on
the
black
marble
table
beside
his
sleeping
mattress
then
from
his
traveling
chest
he
took
the
dark
brown
leather
pack
that
had
accompanied
him
here
from
lucera
he
felt
for
the
small
packet
and
drew
it
out
unwrapping
the
oily
parchment
he
looked
at
the
small
black
cake
a
square
about
half
the
length
of
his
finger
on
a
side
he
drew
his
dagger
out
of
its
sheath
the
dagger
that
would
have
been
poor
protection
for
him
earlier
if
he
had
had
to
fight
those
filippeschi
men
carefully
he
shaved
peelings
from
the
cake
to
the
polished
black
marble
with
the
sharp
edge
of
the
dagger
he
chopped
at
the
peelings
until
he
had
a
coarse
powder
he
held
the
cup
of
cooling
black
liquid
below
the
edge
of
the
table
and
scraped
the
powder
into
it
he
stirred
the
kaviyeh
with
the
point
holding
the
cup
up
before
him
as
if
he
were
offering
a
toast
he
spoke
the
hashishiyya
invocation
in
the
name
of
the
voice
comes
brightness
he
put
the
cup
to
his
lips
and
sipped
it
slowly
the
lukewarm
kaviyeh
masked
the
other
taste
but
he
knew
it
would
begin
to
work
as
soon
as
it
reached
his
stomach
he
peered
into
the
bottom
of
the
cup
to
make
sure
he
had
missed
no
precious
grains
then
set
it
down
magic
horse
that
flies
to
so
the
hashishiyya
called
it
from
sheikh
saadi
he
had
learned
how
to
resist
the
power
of
drugs
from
imam
fayum
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
he
learned
how
to
use
them
when
he
chose
naked
daoud
lay
back
on
his
mattress
with
a
sigh
that
sounded
like
a
roar
in
his
ears
if
the
filippeschi
came
upon
him
to
kill
him
now
he
would
greet
them
with
a
smile
and
open
arms
lying
on
his
back
his
head
resting
on
a
cushion
he
let
his
senses
expand
to
fill
the
world
around
him
his
eyes
traced
the
intricate
floral
pattern
of
a
damask
wall
hanging
the
humming
of
a
large
black
fly
that
had
blundered
in
through
the
open
casement
and
the
closed
curtains
resounded
in
his
ears
like
a
dervish
chorus
chanting
themselves
into
an
ecstasy
odors
swept
in
through
the
open
window
clean
mountain
air
with
the
scent
of
pines
in
it
but
from
nearby
the
swampy
foul
reek
of
every
kind
of
filth
produced
by
thousands
of
human
beings
living
too
close
to
one
another
it
had
rained
last
night
but
not
enough
to
clean
the
streets
and
the
scavenging
pigs
daoud
heightened
senses
could
hear
and
smell
them
too
could
not
keep
up
with
the
garbage
and
sewage
produced
by
the
overcrowded
people
of
orvieto
but
he
need
not
remain
in
orvieto
he
raised
his
head
and
lifted
the
chain
that
held
the
silver
locket
about
his
neck
turning
the
little
screw
that
fastened
the
lid
of
the
locket
he
let
it
fall
open
it
covered
most
of
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
holding
the
crystal
disk
backed
by
silver
close
to
his
eyes
he
saw
his
face
reflected
back
at
him
from
the
convex
surface
his
image
was
broken
up
by
a
pattern
etched
into
the
transparency
a
webwork
of
interlocking
angles
and
boxes
spirals
and
concentric
circles
the
pattern
formed
a
maze
too
complex
for
the
eye
to
grasp
he
believed
that
the
man
who
used
a
stylus
doubtless
to
cut
the
design
into
the
crystal
must
have
gone
blind
in
the
course
of
his
work
no
mosque
bore
a
more
intricate
or
more
beautiful
pattern
on
its
walls
his
eyes
as
they
always
did
when
he
looked
into
the
locket
tried
to
follow
the
pattern
and
became
lost
in
it
as
the
drug
extended
its
empire
within
him
it
seemed
that
he
could
actually
see
his
eyes
coalesced
into
a
single
eye
staring
back
at
him
from
the
net
of
lines
and
whorls
that
entrapped
it
captive
eye
means
that
the
locket
now
controls
what
i
he
saw
the
face
of
sophia
karaiannides
her
dark
lips
luscious
as
red
grapes
were
parted
slightly
showing
even
white
teeth
her
eyelids
were
half
lowered
over
burning
eyes
her
hair
hung
unbound
in
brunette
waves
on
either
side
of
her
face
she
had
splashed
water
on
her
face
and
the
droplets
gleamed
on
her
cheeks
and
brow
like
jewels
daoud
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
seeing
her
exactly
as
she
was
at
this
moment
somewhere
else
in
the
cardinal
mansion
the
locket
had
that
property
i
do
not
want
to
see
sophia
i
want
blossoming
then
sophia
spoke
to
him
oh
david
why
will
you
not
come
to
my
bed
her
voice
was
rich
as
velvet
his
muscles
tensed
with
a
sudden
hunger
a
need
that
francesca
the
woman
he
bedded
with
now
and
then
at
tilia
caballo
could
never
satisfy
sophia
he
realized
could
give
him
what
he
wanted
what
he
missed
so
terribly
since
leaving
home
let
me
see
blossoming
he
shut
his
eyes
and
sophia
was
still
looking
at
him
the
locket
and
the
drug
together
could
show
a
man
things
he
did
not
want
to
see
make
him
feel
things
he
did
not
want
to
feel
things
that
were
inside
him
that
he
did
not
want
to
know
knowledge
you
run
from
is
the
most
precious
of
saadi
had
said
know
i
want
sophia
i
do
not
hide
that
from
myself
but
i
can
not
have
her
let
me
therefore
see
my
wife
blossoming
reed
she
who
gave
me
this
sophia
image
faded
now
and
he
saw
again
the
crystal
and
its
pattern
that
caught
his
soul
like
a
fish
in
its
toils
gradually
the
pattern
became
the
face
of
blossoming
reed
sparks
flashed
from
her
slanting
eyes
painted
with
black
rings
of
kohl
her
wide
mouth
was
a
downturned
crescent
of
scorn
the
nostrils
of
her
hawklike
nose
flared
proudly
there
was
a
message
in
her
face
what
did
she
know
and
what
was
she
trying
to
tell
him
blossoming
reed
daughter
of
baibars
and
a
canaanite
wife
baibars
had
stolen
from
the
crusader
stronghold
in
sidon
it
was
rumored
that
blossoming
reed
mother
practiced
a
kind
of
sorcery
that
was
ancient
even
when
the
hebrews
were
in
bondage
in
egypt
but
would
baibars
the
mightiest
defender
of
the
faith
since
saladin
allow
in
his
own
house
daoud
could
not
believe
it
and
yet
what
was
this
locket
if
not
the
work
of
some
evil
magician
he
would
not
have
touched
the
thing
much
less
worn
it
had
it
not
come
from
blossoming
reed
whom
he
loved
blossoming
reed
betrothed
to
him
at
twelve
married
to
him
at
fourteen
whose
breasts
were
like
oranges
and
whose
nails
flayed
his
back
in
their
lovemaking
blossoming
reed
baibars
gift
of
honor
to
him
seal
and
symbol
of
eternal
friendship
between
baibars
and
daoud
ibn
abdallah
blossoming
reed
who
now
spoke
to
him
in
anger
out
of
the
magic
of
hashish
and
the
locket
back
to
the
well
daoud
back
to
the
well
to
the
well
of
goliath
he
saw
again
the
plain
of
tamarisk
thorn
bush
and
grass
and
the
long
black
line
of
charging
tartars
eagerly
daoud
leaned
forward
in
the
saddle
tightly
he
gripped
his
bow
devils
now
you
will
pay
for
baghdad
he
had
relived
that
day
the
greatest
battle
of
his
life
hundreds
of
times
in
thoughtful
moments
in
dreams
in
hashish
visions
what
he
saw
now
were
moments
that
seemed
to
leap
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
screaming
a
war
cry
and
brandishing
a
scimitar
a
tartar
galloped
at
him
they
were
in
open
ground
daoud
circled
away
sheathing
his
saif
and
pulling
his
bow
from
its
case
the
tartar
chased
him
guiding
his
horse
with
his
knees
and
firing
arrow
after
arrow
at
daoud
but
he
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
he
was
not
aiming
carefully
and
all
the
arrows
whistled
over
daoud
head
the
muscles
of
the
black
yemenite
stallion
bunched
and
stretched
under
daoud
as
its
hooves
thundered
over
the
plain
he
stood
in
the
saddle
he
turned
and
took
aim
along
the
shaft
of
his
arrow
at
the
center
of
the
tartar
chest
the
arrow
went
low
to
daoud
annoyance
and
struck
the
tartar
in
the
side
of
the
stomach
but
he
must
have
been
wearing
light
leather
armor
for
the
arrow
with
its
steel
point
went
deep
into
him
the
tartar
gave
a
short
cry
and
dropped
his
bow
then
fell
like
a
stone
from
the
saddle
into
the
sand
daoud
wheeled
his
yemenite
about
then
jerked
the
horse
to
a
stop
and
jumped
from
the
saddle
with
his
saif
out
the
tartar
had
somehow
risen
to
all
fours
but
was
vomiting
blood
into
the
sand
daoud
kicked
him
with
his
foot
and
rolled
him
over
on
his
back
holding
his
saif
high
he
looked
into
the
face
of
nicetas
contorted
with
pain
and
fear
oh
god
he
whispered
oh
god
no
he
stood
paralyzed
their
eyes
met
nicetas
said
you
have
to
god
be
merciful
to
me
daoud
said
and
brought
the
saif
down
xxviii
lorenzo
eyes
ached
as
he
stared
through
a
peephole
in
the
doorway
of
a
storeroom
into
the
common
room
of
the
inn
called
the
angel
alternating
his
left
and
right
eye
at
intervals
he
stared
at
a
bench
by
the
opposite
wall
where
a
hooded
figure
sat
alone
holding
a
cup
of
wine
in
his
lap
as
lorenzo
had
instructed
him
the
tavern
keeper
had
put
a
lighted
candle
in
a
sconce
near
where
sordello
was
sitting
so
that
lorenzo
could
watch
his
quarry
the
candle
beside
sordello
was
one
of
only
four
in
the
common
room
just
light
enough
for
the
innkeeper
to
be
certain
he
was
paid
in
honest
coin
while
making
it
hard
for
his
patrons
to
see
the
color
of
his
wine
it
was
early
evening
and
there
were
only
about
six
men
and
women
in
the
room
all
of
them
except
sordello
sat
on
benches
at
the
one
long
table
near
the
wine
barrel
sordello
leaning
against
the
wooden
wall
had
to
set
his
cup
beside
him
the
mercenary
square
hand
lifted
the
painted
pottery
cup
into
the
shadow
of
his
hood
lorenzo
knew
sordello
was
under
the
tightly
drawn
hood
only
because
he
had
followed
him
diligently
through
the
tangle
of
orvieto
streets
from
the
house
where
a
dozen
of
the
brigosi
lorenzo
had
recruited
were
quartered
daoud
secret
army
was
growing
the
evening
after
the
reception
lorenzo
had
sealed
a
bargain
with
marco
di
filippeschi
who
was
ready
to
help
daoud
against
the
alliance
if
it
meant
striking
a
blow
against
the
monaldeschi
before
any
plans
were
made
though
there
remained
the
question
of
sordello
a
stout
woman
in
a
black
gown
came
into
the
common
room
of
the
angel
and
went
straight
to
the
hooded
man
the
lower
part
of
her
face
was
covered
by
a
black
scarf
anyone
watching
the
hooded
sordello
and
the
veiled
lady
would
think
theirs
was
just
everyday
wickedness
an
adulterous
couple
meeting
for
an
assignation
she
sat
beside
him
on
the
bench
their
heads
drew
together
and
lorenzo
behind
a
door
across
the
room
was
too
far
away
to
hear
lorenzo
heard
a
scratching
behind
him
he
turned
but
it
was
too
dark
even
to
see
movement
he
thought
work
continually
brings
a
man
into
the
company
of
rats
rats
and
men
like
he
put
his
eye
to
the
peephole
again
just
in
time
to
see
a
slip
of
paper
disappear
into
the
woman
deep
sleeve
whoever
sordello
was
reporting
to
he
was
putting
it
in
writing
interesting
that
the
man
write
that
put
him
a
cut
above
the
average
bravo
in
education
at
least
the
innkeeper
came
over
to
offer
the
woman
wine
but
she
waved
him
away
without
looking
at
him
she
stood
up
brushing
the
seat
of
her
gown
fastidiously
like
one
who
was
used
to
sitting
in
cleaner
surroundings
without
a
gesture
or
a
handclasp
she
left
sordello
as
quickly
as
she
had
come
nothing
loverlike
about
those
two
lorenzo
decided
to
follow
the
woman
and
left
by
the
bolthole
the
tavern
keeper
had
shown
him
he
doubted
that
the
old
bravo
would
do
anything
other
than
sit
there
and
get
drunk
he
had
to
run
through
the
alley
beside
the
inn
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
going
around
a
corner
she
was
hard
to
see
the
darkness
of
night
was
made
deeper
by
the
jutting
upper
stories
of
the
houses
and
she
was
wearing
black
he
kept
running
his
footfalls
muffled
by
the
mushy
layers
of
moldering
refuse
that
paved
the
streets
a
woman
going
through
the
byways
of
the
poorest
part
of
town
after
dark
was
taking
a
great
chance
with
her
purse
and
her
honor
she
was
either
well
paid
or
very
dedicated
lorenzo
whispering
breathless
curses
twice
had
almost
lost
her
in
the
maze
before
she
emerged
onto
a
wider
street
the
via
di
san
remo
there
lights
from
windows
made
her
easier
to
follow
now
he
was
quite
sure
where
she
was
going
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
leading
to
the
front
door
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
the
door
opened
there
was
a
blaze
of
torchlight
and
she
pulled
down
her
scarf
to
identify
herself
even
from
across
the
street
lorenzo
knew
her
ana
the
woman
who
interpreted
for
the
tartars
sophia
entered
cardinal
ugolini
cabinet
holding
a
letter
written
by
simon
de
gobignon
it
had
been
pressed
into
her
hand
by
the
french
count
young
scudiero
when
she
was
out
walking
she
had
read
it
over
and
over
again
before
bringing
it
to
david
he
was
alone
in
the
room
as
he
looked
up
from
his
seat
on
a
pile
of
cushions
on
the
floor
she
caught
her
breath
in
that
white
light
coming
through
the
translucent
glass
panes
david
grayish
eyes
took
on
an
opalescence
the
cardinal
cabinet
on
the
top
floor
was
the
chamber
in
the
mansion
when
ugolini
was
not
using
the
room
david
often
came
here
to
study
write
and
meditate
and
when
neither
david
nor
ugolini
was
there
sophia
sometimes
came
to
draw
and
paint
she
felt
as
if
david
were
a
magician
and
that
his
eyes
had
cast
a
spell
on
her
in
ugolini
cabinet
it
was
easy
to
think
of
magic
she
had
always
associated
magic
with
darkened
chambers
and
cellars
but
ugolini
practiced
his
magic
at
the
top
of
his
mansion
in
a
room
with
many
windows
the
answer
from
simon
has
come
sophia
said
tossing
the
opened
scroll
down
before
david
david
spread
simon
letter
on
his
lap
and
read
it
while
sophia
looked
around
the
room
on
a
table
near
a
window
lay
that
painted
skull
ugolini
kept
toying
with
on
one
wall
were
two
maps
of
the
heavens
sophia
recognized
the
constellations
in
one
of
them
but
the
other
was
utterly
strange
one
arrangement
of
stars
in
the
second
map
seemed
to
take
the
form
of
a
latin
cross
she
studied
with
interest
the
paintings
on
scrolls
nailed
to
the
walls
of
plants
and
animals
so
that
she
thought
they
might
be
an
artist
inventions
one
was
a
bird
without
wings
another
a
spotted
animal
that
looked
like
a
deer
but
had
an
enormously
elongated
neck
it
might
be
pleasant
to
try
painting
such
creatures
herself
as
david
eyes
ran
over
simon
letter
his
lips
curled
in
a
faint
smile
was
it
a
smile
of
contempt
for
simon
passionate
outpouring
which
she
had
in
her
delight
with
it
all
but
memorized
lady
i
cry
you
mercy
you
know
it
not
but
your
gentle
eyes
are
more
puissant
than
a
mighty
host
from
those
eyes
have
flown
such
bolts
as
wound
but
do
not
kill
and
they
have
pierced
my
heart
i
will
bleed
forever
within
my
breast
where
none
can
see
and
all
will
wonder
at
my
pallor
and
my
weakness
that
have
no
outward
cause
the
physick
for
any
wound
or
illness
sages
tell
us
must
be
like
that
which
caused
the
hurt
thus
only
you
who
have
delivered
this
wound
can
cure
it
let
me
come
to
you
i
beg
under
cover
of
night
let
me
but
adore
you
in
secrecy
for
a
moment
and
my
strength
will
return
he
is
almost
as
good
as
an
arab
poet
david
said
mockingly
as
he
handed
her
back
the
letter
did
it
bother
him
she
wondered
that
simon
wrote
words
of
love
to
her
david
she
saw
was
working
on
a
letter
of
his
own
on
a
tiny
thin
scrap
of
vellum
on
a
writing
board
which
he
now
laid
over
his
knees
as
if
to
show
her
that
simon
letter
was
of
no
moment
to
him
he
added
to
his
own
writing
rapidly
with
a
quill
dipped
in
an
inkpot
but
from
right
to
left
you
write
backwards
she
said
seating
herself
beside
him
on
the
floor
to
look
at
his
work
no
christians
do
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
he
covered
what
he
was
writing
with
his
hand
but
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
lines
that
wavered
and
curled
like
tiny
black
snakes
why
bother
to
cover
it
do
you
really
imagine
that
i
could
read
that
lightly
she
touched
the
hand
that
covered
the
writing
noticing
the
fine
yellow
hairs
on
its
back
i
have
to
keep
up
the
habit
of
secrecy
he
gave
her
one
of
his
rare
full
smiles
and
she
wanted
to
reach
out
and
hold
his
face
between
her
hands
they
were
so
close
she
thought
sitting
side
by
side
here
on
the
floor
and
alone
they
had
but
to
stretch
out
on
this
thick
arabian
carpet
and
wrap
their
arms
around
each
other
but
of
course
ugolini
or
one
of
his
servants
might
come
in
at
any
moment
her
longing
for
david
was
a
constant
ache
she
had
not
thought
of
manfred
save
as
a
figure
in
the
background
of
their
lives
in
weeks
and
as
long
as
she
did
not
have
to
meet
with
simon
she
was
fully
sophia
karaiannides
and
not
troubled
by
the
yearning
of
sophia
orfali
for
the
young
french
count
if
only
david
did
not
insist
on
keeping
her
at
a
distance
do
you
still
want
me
to
let
simon
de
gobignon
visit
me
secretly
she
asked
there
was
a
momentary
silence
between
them
then
have
i
told
you
of
any
change
in
plans
he
said
gruffly
he
looked
down
at
his
scrap
of
parchment
with
the
tiny
crawling
lines
what
shall
i
let
him
do
when
we
are
together
she
asked
quietly
know
david
is
jealous
and
i
am
goading
him
i
want
to
hear
his
he
stood
up
abruptly
and
put
his
writing
board
on
a
table
he
walked
to
an
open
window
and
stood
looking
out
rolling
his
thin
parchment
tightly
between
his
fingers
she
hated
this
conversation
it
turned
him
into
a
panderer
and
her
into
a
whore
and
she
sensed
that
he
hated
it
as
much
as
she
did
do
what
you
think
is
necessary
he
said
coldly
to
what
she
demanded
through
gritted
teeth
he
turned
toward
her
and
held
up
a
finger
to
win
his
trust
he
held
up
a
second
finger
to
hear
and
remember
anything
he
may
let
slip
he
held
up
a
third
finger
most
important
to
tell
him
things
tell
him
what
tell
him
that
cardinal
ugolini
has
persuaded
fra
tomasso
to
oppose
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
and
if
simon
believes
you
have
won
over
fra
tomasso
what
will
that
accomplish
the
unbelievers
are
already
desperate
to
repair
the
damage
i
have
done
to
the
reputation
of
the
tartars
david
said
if
they
think
they
have
lost
fra
tomasso
they
may
be
provoked
to
do
exactly
the
wrong
thing
what
would
that
be
sophia
had
heard
that
muslims
were
devious
she
certainly
could
not
follow
daoud
mind
in
this
not
knowing
fra
tomasso
is
actually
trying
to
remain
neutral
they
will
use
every
means
they
have
to
try
to
win
him
back
as
they
think
to
their
side
i
am
hoping
they
will
try
to
bring
cardinal
de
influence
to
bear
if
de
verceuil
goes
to
fra
tomasso
or
even
better
to
fra
tomasso
superiors
he
may
well
drive
the
learned
friar
over
to
our
side
what
if
you
are
wrong
what
if
de
verceuil
and
the
other
franks
do
persuade
fra
tomasso
to
support
the
alliance
would
it
not
be
better
to
leave
him
where
he
is
neutral
daoud
shook
his
head
at
least
this
way
we
are
trying
to
control
what
happens
she
smiled
i
thought
you
muslims
believed
in
leaving
things
up
to
fate
the
efforts
of
men
are
part
of
the
workings
of
fate
she
would
probably
never
understand
his
muslim
way
of
thinking
perhaps
he
would
not
accept
her
love
because
he
saw
her
as
an
unbeliever
it
made
her
angry
to
think
he
might
hold
himself
aloof
from
her
because
of
her
religion
and
he
not
even
a
muslim
born
the
turks
killed
your
parents
she
said
how
can
you
be
a
muslim
it
was
something
she
had
never
understood
and
had
wanted
to
know
ever
since
she
learned
what
he
was
but
she
asked
it
now
to
hurt
him
he
gave
her
that
silent
burning
stare
and
she
began
to
wonder
with
a
rippling
of
fear
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
if
she
was
in
danger
that
was
my
fate
he
said
i
had
to
lose
my
mother
and
father
to
find
god
before
she
could
catch
herself
she
started
to
laugh
with
a
kind
of
wildness
a
touch
of
hysteria
she
had
been
angry
at
him
and
had
goaded
him
and
feared
his
striking
back
and
instead
he
made
a
statement
that
was
utterly
absurd
lost
my
mother
and
father
and
i
gained
nothing
from
it
i
became
nothing
neither
daughter
nor
wife
nor
at
her
laughter
he
took
a
step
backward
as
if
she
had
struck
him
and
his
tan
face
reddened
now
she
felt
terror
this
time
she
had
surely
gone
too
far
forgive
me
your
answer
surprised
me
it
sounds
so
strange
for
a
man
of
your
profession
to
talk
of
finding
god
what
profession
well
you
are
a
warrior
and
a
spy
not
a
holy
man
we
do
not
need
to
speak
of
this
he
turned
away
from
her
to
stare
out
the
window
she
looked
past
him
at
rooftops
a
flock
of
pigeons
circled
in
the
distance
no
she
said
and
as
an
unbeliever
i
suppose
i
would
not
understand
surprisingly
he
approached
her
and
looked
down
with
eyes
that
were
serious
and
free
of
anger
if
you
ever
in
sincerity
want
to
know
about
islam
come
and
ask
me
and
as
best
i
can
i
will
answer
your
questions
but
do
not
speak
foolishness
and
do
not
laugh
she
thought
she
understood
a
bit
better
the
muslims
had
captured
his
body
but
then
in
his
enslavement
he
had
freely
given
his
soul
to
their
religion
he
did
not
serve
the
turks
he
served
the
god
they
called
allah
how
this
had
come
about
she
could
not
imagine
but
she
knew
a
little
better
why
his
sultan
had
entrusted
him
with
this
undertaking
he
was
perfect
for
it
i
must
go
he
said
as
if
eager
not
to
talk
anymore
to
deliver
your
message
she
gestured
toward
the
clenched
fist
that
held
the
fragile
parchment
is
there
truly
someone
in
orvieto
who
can
read
it
he
smiled
again
oh
that
smile
it
so
easily
overcame
her
anger
and
fear
there
is
no
harm
in
my
telling
you
it
goes
to
my
sultan
by
carrier
pigeon
and
ship
he
must
be
proud
she
thought
of
his
swift
and
secret
courier
system
and
do
you
get
messages
back
in
the
same
way
it
takes
over
a
month
each
way
so
i
have
received
but
one
message
from
the
sultan
since
coming
to
italy
does
the
cardinal
keep
the
pigeons
he
had
taken
a
tiny
leather
capsule
out
of
his
belt
purse
and
was
inserting
the
message
into
it
now
madama
tilia
keeps
the
pigeons
then
are
you
going
to
her
house
sophia
remembered
with
a
feeling
of
guilt
that
she
had
not
thought
of
rachel
in
some
time
please
david
will
you
see
how
rachel
is
while
you
are
there
david
looked
at
her
quickly
and
glanced
away
she
felt
a
coldness
in
her
chest
what
has
happened
to
her
she
demanded
she
seized
david
arm
lest
he
turn
away
from
her
he
did
not
try
to
pull
free
she
is
well
she
is
already
wealthy
in
fact
his
eyes
did
not
meet
hers
at
all
now
oh
my
god
a
man
has
had
her
she
let
go
of
david
and
turned
her
back
on
him
there
was
another
silence
while
fury
churned
in
sophia
she
wanted
to
turn
on
david
to
scratch
his
face
with
her
nails
she
wanted
to
tear
her
clothing
in
anguish
in
mourning
for
rachel
lost
innocence
she
hated
herself
for
her
part
in
the
child
degradation
sophia
david
voice
came
from
behind
her
soft
a
little
uncertain
were
you
so
much
older
than
rachel
when
you
became
a
woman
wrath
overpowered
her
other
feelings
and
she
turned
on
him
do
you
think
is
what
makes
a
girl
into
a
woman
and
you
complain
about
speaking
foolishness
how
old
sophia
his
voice
was
more
confident
now
as
if
her
anger
had
put
him
on
firmer
ground
she
thought
of
alexis
the
boy
she
had
loved
and
the
long
afternoons
they
had
spent
together
hidden
under
an
old
broken
arch
covered
with
vines
and
lapped
by
waves
on
the
aegean
side
of
constantinople
she
shook
her
head
yes
i
was
her
age
but
i
was
in
love
doing
it
for
money
or
for
my
city
came
later
when
i
was
alone
in
the
world
and
older
there
was
appeal
in
his
look
but
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
alone
and
in
need
just
as
you
freely
chose
to
serve
the
emperor
of
constantinople
with
your
body
so
rachel
freely
chose
to
sell
her
virginity
for
a
fortune
in
gold
his
obtuseness
made
her
more
angry
than
ever
you
know
nothing
about
freedom
or
women
rachel
was
no
more
free
to
keep
her
virginity
than
you
were
free
to
remain
a
christian
after
the
turks
captured
you
as
for
me
at
least
i
know
enough
to
hate
the
murderers
of
my
parents
his
fingers
dug
into
her
shoulders
until
they
hurt
and
the
fire
in
his
eyes
terrified
her
but
she
held
her
face
frozen
refusing
to
show
fear
or
pain
say
no
more
he
whispered
in
a
strangled
voice
not
another
word
simon
protect
she
could
see
the
struggle
in
david
face
and
body
she
had
enraged
him
to
the
point
where
he
wanted
to
hurt
her
but
he
was
not
going
to
let
himself
do
it
she
thought
she
must
have
taken
a
hundred
breaths
before
he
released
his
grip
on
her
shoulders
pushing
her
away
a
little
again
she
wondered
what
he
had
been
through
that
would
give
him
such
iron
she
stood
looking
at
him
breathing
heavily
in
the
aftermath
of
her
terror
am
a
fool
to
despise
anything
as
powerful
as
what
he
he
raked
her
with
his
eyes
then
turned
toward
the
door
do
not
bother
to
find
out
about
rachel
for
me
she
said
i
will
go
myself
he
stopped
and
the
fury
in
his
face
made
her
brace
herself
again
for
an
attack
you
can
not
go
you
can
not
be
seen
going
into
tilia
do
you
think
i
have
served
great
men
for
years
without
learning
how
to
move
about
a
city
unnoticed
go
then
his
normally
fair
face
was
scarlet
with
rage
and
learn
from
rachel
own
lips
what
the
tartar
did
to
her
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
go
blind
and
deaf
she
felt
hot
and
cold
at
once
her
body
had
reacted
to
the
meaning
of
his
words
before
her
brain
understood
them
the
man
was
a
tartar
you
let
a
tartar
have
her
sophia
seized
the
first
object
near
her
hand
and
threw
it
at
him
she
saw
as
it
struck
him
that
it
was
the
painted
skull
it
hit
his
chest
with
a
thump
and
he
took
a
step
backward
you
filthy
bastard
she
screamed
pig
of
a
turk
expressionless
he
turned
without
another
word
and
left
her
closing
the
door
of
ugolini
cabinet
behind
him
she
sank
weeping
to
the
floor
rachel
how
could
they
do
this
to
you
with
a
tartar
oh
no
she
sat
there
until
her
tears
stopped
and
her
thoughts
began
to
make
some
sense
the
skull
lying
on
its
side
seemed
to
look
back
at
her
you
david
you
have
made
my
decision
for
me
simon
de
gobignon
shall
have
xxix
this
was
a
fearsome
place
thought
daoud
as
he
gazed
around
the
underground
chamber
hewn
out
of
the
yellow
tufa
on
which
the
building
stood
lit
with
torches
its
vault
was
festooned
with
ropes
and
chains
one
wall
lined
with
whips
rods
and
scourges
hanging
from
hooks
pokers
and
branding
irons
heating
in
smoking
braziers
a
rack
in
one
corner
a
ring
of
wood
and
iron
six
feet
in
diameter
suspended
in
the
center
of
the
room
on
which
a
man
could
be
a
veritable
bazaar
of
torture
instruments
its
door
was
of
solid
oak
reinforced
with
strips
of
iron
designed
to
dash
any
hope
of
escape
daoud
sat
in
a
thronelike
chair
painted
black
tilia
said
it
had
once
belonged
to
a
pope
on
a
raised
platform
against
a
wall
if
the
damned
chair
had
a
few
cushions
in
it
it
might
almost
be
comfortable
this
place
tilia
had
told
him
was
for
patrons
of
hers
who
liked
to
torture
or
be
tortured
it
was
perfect
for
his
purpose
but
could
he
himself
be
as
perfect
as
the
room
this
was
a
hard
and
wily
man
he
had
to
deal
with
tonight
it
would
be
difficult
to
dominate
him
beside
daoud
a
preparation
of
wine
hashish
and
the
distilled
juice
of
the
anatolian
poppy
simmered
in
a
pot
held
on
a
metal
tripod
over
a
candle
flame
he
sniffed
the
faint
steam
that
rose
from
the
warm
potion
he
warned
himself
to
do
no
more
sniffing
or
he
would
be
unable
to
conduct
the
night
proceedings
with
a
clear
head
he
glanced
down
at
one
broad
arm
of
the
throne
where
a
small
brass
bowl
lay
in
the
dish
rested
a
steel
needle
as
long
as
a
forefinger
its
tip
covered
with
a
black
paste
a
nervous
anticipation
tingled
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
but
he
held
himself
very
still
daoud
heard
lorenzo
voice
and
a
moment
later
the
door
swung
open
a
man
stumbled
through
his
head
covered
with
a
black
hood
his
hands
tied
behind
him
his
ankles
chained
close
together
with
two
of
tilia
mute
black
slaves
held
his
arms
behind
him
walked
lorenzo
a
dagger
held
at
waist
level
daoud
sat
straighter
in
the
throne
resting
his
hands
on
the
arms
the
door
boomed
shut
and
at
lorenzo
command
the
slaves
untied
the
prisoner
wrists
and
pulled
the
hood
off
his
head
sordello
stood
before
daoud
blinking
and
staring
angrily
around
him
daoud
watched
pleased
as
the
sight
of
the
irons
and
chains
and
scourges
bore
in
on
sordello
and
the
anger
on
the
bravo
face
changed
to
alarm
why
have
you
done
this
to
me
what
the
devil
is
this
place
an
appropriate
question
daoud
thought
you
are
in
hell
he
said
sordello
squinted
at
daoud
and
who
are
you
supposed
to
be
messer
david
the
prince
of
darkness
is
this
some
sort
of
miracle
play
the
man
defiance
dismayed
daoud
he
had
hoped
that
the
mere
sight
of
the
chamber
would
set
sordello
to
babbling
and
begging
he
needed
to
be
frightened
more
have
them
chain
him
to
the
ring
lorenzo
sordello
aimed
a
kick
at
one
of
the
slaves
following
lorenzo
orders
the
african
gave
sordello
arm
a
quick
twist
and
got
a
howl
of
pain
out
of
him
soon
the
aging
bravo
arms
stretched
out
legs
spread
apart
was
suspended
upright
in
the
great
hoop
the
ring
of
iron
hung
from
the
ceiling
on
a
single
chain
wrapped
around
a
huge
beam
allowing
it
to
rotate
slowly
daoud
imagined
how
helpless
sordello
must
feel
hanging
there
lorenzo
took
hold
of
the
ring
and
gave
it
a
spin
face
and
back
face
and
back
face
and
back
sordello
whirled
before
daoud
his
eyes
bulged
figlii
di
cagne
he
shouted
more
angry
than
frightened
but
perhaps
he
is
just
good
at
concealing
his
daoud
made
a
small
hand
gesture
and
lorenzo
stopped
the
spin
of
the
ring
so
that
sordello
was
facing
daoud
daoud
studied
sordello
looking
for
the
subtle
signs
that
would
reveal
his
true
feelings
his
eyes
gleamed
like
a
caged
hyena
full
of
hatred
for
daoud
lorenzo
had
kept
sordello
locked
in
a
cubicle
in
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
for
a
day
and
a
night
before
bringing
him
here
daoud
studied
the
man
it
was
obvious
from
his
pallor
his
eyelids
and
his
sagging
mouth
that
sordello
had
lain
awake
much
of
the
time
in
the
darkness
daoud
could
see
the
fear
too
in
the
clenching
and
unclenching
of
sordello
jaw
muscles
daoud
flicked
a
finger
at
lorenzo
read
the
love
song
you
found
on
this
trovatore
when
you
seized
him
lorenzo
unfolded
a
square
scrap
of
parchment
and
read
your
magnificence
on
thursday
last
donna
sophia
left
the
cardinal
mansion
alone
on
foot
and
heavily
veiled
as
she
clearly
did
not
want
to
be
seen
your
servant
thought
much
was
to
be
gained
by
following
her
and
so
did
i
regret
to
say
she
spent
the
afternoon
wandering
in
the
craftsmen
market
shopping
for
gloves
purses
and
other
adornments
before
nones
she
went
to
the
church
of
sant
andrea
where
she
prayed
a
while
then
went
to
confession
your
servant
attempted
to
approach
close
enough
to
overhear
but
was
unable
to
do
so
without
being
seen
lorenzo
looked
up
and
shook
his
head
what
a
furfante
you
are
trying
to
eavesdrop
on
penitents
he
went
on
with
the
reading
david
of
trebizond
has
spent
his
days
riding
about
orvieto
meeting
with
the
fattori
of
various
trading
houses
that
deal
in
silks
and
spices
your
servant
adds
a
list
below
the
cardinal
sleeps
most
of
the
day
and
works
through
the
night
behind
the
locked
door
of
his
cabinet
on
the
top
floor
of
the
palazzo
sometimes
he
mounts
to
the
roof
and
studies
the
stars
with
the
aid
of
magical
instruments
of
the
servant
giancarlo
i
am
unable
to
make
report
having
not
seen
him
all
this
week
lorenzo
laughed
that
is
the
only
true
statement
in
this
list
of
lies
you
did
not
see
me
all
week
because
i
have
been
constantly
at
back
sordello
spat
at
lorenzo
feet
ladruncolo
sneak
at
this
lorenzo
and
daoud
broke
into
laughter
while
sordello
glared
at
them
helplessly
the
hoop
on
which
he
was
splayed
turned
slowly
one
way
and
then
back
the
other
you
are
indignant
at
being
spied
upon
lorenzo
chuckled
then
imagine
how
we
feel
and
what
is
worse
you
do
not
even
tell
the
truth
about
us
i
piss
in
your
teeth
sordello
snarled
for
instance
what
you
write
about
madonna
sophia
lorenzo
went
on
unperturbed
you
lost
her
a
mere
three
streets
from
the
mansion
she
knew
you
were
following
her
and
took
pains
to
rid
herself
of
your
unwanted
attentions
but
you
could
not
admit
to
your
master
what
a
buffone
you
are
so
you
made
up
all
that
about
her
buying
gloves
in
the
bazaar
and
going
to
church
actually
daoud
thought
that
was
the
afternoon
sophia
had
come
here
to
tilia
house
to
see
rachel
and
it
would
have
been
disastrous
if
sordello
had
followed
her
they
would
then
have
had
to
kill
him
which
would
have
been
unfortunate
since
this
way
of
handling
him
was
so
much
better
of
course
they
might
still
have
to
kill
him
he
already
knew
enough
about
them
to
send
them
all
to
the
stake
if
he
ever
spoke
out
he
must
be
brought
under
control
to
serve
their
purposes
or
he
must
quietly
disappear
so
you
not
only
spy
on
us
but
you
lie
about
us
said
daoud
and
to
whom
do
you
send
these
lies
when
the
bulgarian
woman
ana
takes
your
weekly
reports
back
to
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
to
whom
does
she
deliver
them
de
verceuil
de
gobignon
go
peddle
your
silks
and
spices
messer
david
the
man
was
so
he
had
not
the
sense
to
try
to
protect
himself
by
hiding
his
anger
and
defiance
daoud
gritted
his
teeth
in
frustration
sordello
was
not
breaking
quickly
enough
daoud
sent
lorenzo
a
signal
with
two
fingers
lorenzo
sprang
at
sordello
with
his
blade
a
dagger
so
big
it
was
almost
a
short
sword
and
slashed
at
his
tunic
belt
and
hose
the
blacks
grinned
sordello
roared
his
protests
a
last
flick
of
the
blade
cut
away
his
grimy
loincloth
in
a
moment
sordello
hung
naked
on
the
ring
his
shredded
clothes
hanging
from
his
ankles
or
lying
on
the
flagstone
floor
his
body
was
wiry
and
muscular
with
only
a
small
paunch
at
the
waist
the
flickering
torchlight
picked
out
the
shadows
of
scars
crossing
his
chest
and
belly
daoud
stared
with
curiosity
and
faint
distaste
at
the
uncircumcised
penis
peeping
from
its
thicket
of
grizzled
hair
daoud
put
his
fingertips
together
and
casually
crossed
his
legs
lounging
back
in
the
throne
letting
the
contrast
between
his
position
and
sordello
sink
in
he
prayed
that
the
man
might
succumb
his
soul
must
be
made
of
sand
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
ring
slowly
rotated
sordello
twisted
his
head
to
look
over
his
shoulder
at
daoud
if
you
kill
me
he
will
know
there
was
the
faintest
quiver
in
his
voice
daoud
chose
not
to
ask
the
obvious
question
who
he
was
but
said
keeping
his
voice
soft
and
kindly
what
will
he
learn
from
your
death
sordello
before
sordello
could
answer
lorenzo
burst
out
we
are
not
going
to
kill
him
for
a
long
while
are
we
messer
david
you
promised
me
i
could
have
some
sport
quiet
giancarlo
said
daoud
narrowing
his
eyes
you
shall
have
your
sport
why
torture
me
why
kill
me
there
was
a
plea
in
sordello
voice
now
i
have
told
nothing
that
could
hurt
you
you
have
told
nothing
sordello
daoud
stood
up
the
platform
on
which
the
throne
chair
stood
gave
him
impressive
height
and
the
torches
high
in
the
wall
behind
him
threw
his
shadow
across
the
room
i
admire
your
fidelity
to
your
master
whoever
he
is
daoud
said
with
a
smile
what
a
pity
he
will
never
know
about
it
as
i
told
you
this
is
hell
and
you
are
dead
already
you
will
just
vanish
like
a
bit
of
rubbish
washed
out
of
the
city
by
the
rain
your
master
will
probably
think
you
deserted
him
as
your
sort
of
wandering
ladrone
so
often
does
i
am
not
a
highwayman
sordello
cry
echoed
against
the
stone
vault
i
am
a
man
of
honor
i
am
an
educated
man
a
trovatore
you
are
feccia
lorenzo
shouted
and
slapped
sordello
face
hard
for
that
i
will
one
day
slice
open
your
guts
sordello
growled
exasperated
daoud
saw
that
hurting
sordello
only
made
him
angrier
if
they
hurt
him
enough
certainly
they
would
have
him
begging
for
mercy
but
by
then
they
might
have
injured
him
so
badly
he
would
be
of
no
use
to
them
let
him
be
giancarlo
daoud
snapped
i
saved
your
life
sordello
said
to
daoud
i
killed
a
man
for
you
is
this
how
you
repay
me
letting
this
pig
strip
me
and
beat
me
his
narrowed
eyes
gave
a
hint
of
slyness
i
could
be
worth
ten
of
this
neapolitan
mezzano
to
you
you
dare
call
me
a
pimp
lorenzo
lunged
at
sordello
again
this
time
aiming
the
point
of
the
huge
dagger
at
his
belly
sordello
twisted
his
body
in
the
chains
and
gave
a
cry
of
fright
giancarlo
daoud
shouted
sternly
back
sordello
hung
rigid
in
his
chains
sweat
ran
down
his
face
his
whole
body
was
covered
with
sweat
glistening
in
the
torchlight
and
daoud
suspected
he
would
be
cold
to
the
touch
sordello
eyes
rolled
from
lorenzo
who
stood
frozen
with
the
dagger
outstretched
to
daoud
and
back
again
the
two
blacks
stood
behind
lorenzo
smiling
broadly
you
are
worth
nothing
to
me
at
the
moment
sordello
because
you
refuse
even
to
give
me
the
one
harmless
piece
of
information
i
ask
for
you
will
not
tell
me
who
set
you
to
spy
on
me
so
i
might
as
well
give
you
to
giancarlo
here
for
his
amusement
he
held
a
hand
out
to
lorenzo
as
if
giving
him
leave
to
proceed
it
is
simon
de
gobignon
sordello
cried
it
is
to
him
my
messages
go
daoud
heart
leapt
with
exultation
and
he
allowed
himself
a
satisfied
little
sigh
a
flicker
of
a
finger
told
lorenzo
to
lower
his
knife
sordello
had
made
the
first
surrender
on
which
all
further
success
with
him
depended
but
de
gobignon
that
was
a
surprise
daoud
had
been
sure
it
would
be
cardinal
de
verceuil
who
would
try
to
place
a
spy
in
his
camp
a
frankish
knight
like
de
gobignon
would
prefer
the
frontal
attack
the
pitched
battle
to
trickery
that
was
why
the
franks
were
gradually
losing
their
grip
on
the
land
they
called
outremer
the
french
cardinal
was
another
story
daoud
had
seen
in
him
a
combination
of
pride
ambition
and
lack
of
scruple
that
would
use
any
means
to
defeat
an
enemy
how
to
find
out
the
truth
he
ground
his
teeth
you
are
lying
daoud
said
firmly
it
is
cardinal
de
verceuil
you
serve
giancarlo
daoud
gestured
and
lorenzo
went
over
to
the
brazier
and
slowly
drew
out
an
iron
the
tip
of
it
glowed
red
in
the
dim
light
of
the
chamber
his
teeth
flashing
white
under
his
thick
mustache
lorenzo
advanced
on
sordello
no
it
is
the
truth
sordello
shrieked
the
chain
that
suspended
the
hoop
rattling
as
he
tried
to
pull
himself
away
from
lorenzo
and
the
smoking
metal
rod
he
held
as
lorenzo
slowly
approached
sordello
babbled
out
a
tale
of
having
been
sent
to
venice
by
charles
brother
of
the
king
of
france
to
recruit
and
command
archers
for
count
simon
he
had
gotten
into
a
brawl
and
wounded
an
armenian
prince
who
had
come
to
venice
with
the
tartars
and
simon
had
sent
him
away
i
can
not
serve
count
simon
openly
because
the
armenians
still
want
my
blood
sordello
explained
so
he
set
me
to
spy
on
you
instead
the
frantic
haste
with
which
sordello
spilled
out
his
story
gave
it
the
sound
of
truth
this
was
going
much
better
daoud
tense
jaw
muscles
were
relaxing
daoud
picked
up
the
bowl
with
the
needle
in
it
gestured
lorenzo
back
and
slowly
strolled
across
the
chamber
to
sordello
he
gave
the
bowl
to
lorenzo
to
hold
and
drew
closer
until
his
face
was
only
a
hand
width
from
sordello
until
he
could
smell
the
inner
rot
on
the
man
breath
sordello
eyes
rolled
sideways
trying
to
watch
the
needle
in
the
bowl
lorenzo
was
holding
what
does
de
gobignon
say
of
me
daoud
whispered
what
does
he
think
i
am
he
thinks
you
are
a
foreigner
brought
here
by
ugolini
to
thwart
the
french
plans
for
a
crusade
sordello
gasped
he
says
ugolini
is
an
agent
of
the
hohenstaufen
king
he
thinks
giancarlo
is
gathering
a
band
of
men
to
murder
the
tartars
please
for
the
love
of
god
do
not
hurt
me
messere
his
eyes
would
fall
out
of
his
head
if
he
stared
any
harder
at
the
needle
give
me
a
candle
giancarlo
said
daoud
he
reached
out
without
looking
and
lorenzo
pressed
the
lighted
candle
into
his
hand
taking
a
step
back
he
held
the
flame
before
sordello
sweating
face
his
lips
trembling
sordello
turned
his
head
away
look
at
the
flame
sordello
said
daoud
softly
just
look
at
the
flame
and
listen
to
me
look
at
the
flame
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
really
am
daoud
passed
the
candle
back
and
forth
before
face
murmuring
reassurance
sordello
eyes
followed
the
candle
he
wondered
if
this
would
work
it
seemed
too
much
like
magic
he
had
seen
it
done
by
hashishiyya
imams
but
he
had
never
done
it
himself
i
am
a
sorcerer
sordello
a
mighty
wizard
i
can
pass
through
any
obstacle
i
can
see
what
people
are
doing
thousands
of
leagues
away
i
can
bring
the
dead
back
to
life
i
told
you
that
you
are
a
dead
man
sordello
you
are
truly
dead
but
you
have
nothing
to
fear
because
my
power
can
bring
you
back
to
life
the
bravo
hung
lax
in
the
chains
his
eyes
still
moving
from
right
to
left
following
the
candle
flame
his
knees
had
buckled
and
his
belly
sagged
daoud
handed
the
candle
to
lorenzo
and
beckoned
to
one
of
the
africans
who
took
the
simmering
pot
of
drugged
wine
from
the
tripod
holding
it
by
a
wooden
handle
and
gave
it
to
daoud
where
are
you
sordello
i
am
in
hell
and
what
are
you
a
dead
man
and
i
a
mighty
wizard
very
good
now
drink
this
daoud
felt
the
lip
of
the
pot
to
make
sure
it
was
not
too
hot
then
brought
it
to
sordello
mouth
obediently
sordello
lifted
his
chin
and
opened
his
lips
allowing
daoud
to
pour
the
warm
wine
into
his
mouth
and
then
swallowed
daoud
poured
more
into
him
and
then
gave
the
pot
back
to
tilia
servant
now
you
will
truly
know
my
power
sordello
prepare
yourself
for
the
most
wonderful
night
of
your
life
you
will
make
a
journey
from
hell
to
heaven
close
your
eyes
and
raise
your
head
lorenzo
held
out
the
brass
bowl
with
the
needle
and
daoud
took
the
needle
holding
it
firmly
with
his
thumb
and
first
two
fingers
gesturing
to
lorenzo
to
bring
the
candle
close
to
sordello
throat
he
searched
out
a
vein
just
where
the
neck
met
the
shoulder
you
can
feel
nothing
you
can
feel
no
pain
at
all
daoud
took
a
deep
breath
and
prayed
to
god
to
guide
his
hand
he
jabbed
the
needle
into
sordello
neck
the
bravo
remained
utterly
motionless
and
daoud
heard
lorenzo
gasp
in
amazement
daoud
left
the
needle
stuck
in
the
pale
pink
flesh
he
watched
sordello
closely
and
put
his
palm
before
his
lax
mouth
he
could
feel
sordello
breath
on
his
palm
slow
and
steady
the
breath
of
a
sleeping
man
after
a
time
the
craggy
block
of
a
head
fell
forward
and
the
body
hung
limp
in
the
chains
so
far
all
was
working
as
he
had
hoped
but
the
man
was
stronger
than
he
had
thought
he
had
been
harder
to
break
there
was
always
the
danger
that
somewhere
deep
in
his
soul
a
part
would
remain
free
daoud
had
heard
of
such
things
happening
of
slaves
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
who
suddenly
rebelled
the
methods
of
the
hashishiyya
were
not
perfect
he
would
have
to
chance
it
it
was
in
god
hands
now
are
you
sure
he
is
not
dead
lorenzo
said
in
a
low
awed
voice
look
for
yourself
he
breathes
his
heart
beats
lorenzo
shook
his
head
what
is
that
stuff
daoud
pointed
to
the
two
africans
who
stood
calmly
by
awaiting
orders
know
in
the
jungle
below
the
great
desert
where
it
is
very
hot
and
wet
a
body
can
rot
in
hours
tiny
men
less
than
half
our
size
live
there
and
they
hunt
large
animals
for
their
meat
they
smear
this
stuff
on
their
darts
it
comes
from
a
mushroom
that
grows
in
their
forest
the
animal
struck
is
paralyzed
and
unconscious
but
it
lives
they
have
time
to
carry
it
back
to
their
village
which
may
take
days
and
then
they
can
slaughter
it
and
butcher
it
but
what
a
blessing
this
could
be
for
the
wounded
and
the
sick
said
lorenzo
why
does
the
world
not
know
of
it
daoud
shrugged
the
tiny
men
kill
those
who
venture
into
their
forests
what
little
is
brought
back
by
arab
traders
is
kept
as
a
precious
secret
only
sultans
may
permit
its
use
he
turned
to
the
two
blacks
take
him
upstairs
now
xxx
well
satisfied
with
what
tilia
had
accomplished
daoud
gazed
about
at
the
frescoed
moons
stars
and
suns
scattered
across
the
dark
blue
walls
of
the
apartment
a
cool
night
breeze
blew
through
the
rooms
from
windows
hidden
by
screens
and
gauzy
curtains
in
the
large
central
chamber
an
oval
pool
gave
off
a
scent
of
roses
hangings
of
violet
silver
and
azure
turned
the
rooms
into
a
maze
that
baffled
the
eye
everywhere
daoud
looked
he
saw
beds
and
divans
and
cushions
the
floors
were
covered
with
soft
rugs
and
the
tables
laden
with
pitchers
of
wine
and
plates
of
peaches
grapes
and
melon
slices
in
a
corner
of
a
smaller
room
its
walls
covered
with
maroon
and
black
drapes
the
flame
of
a
large
candle
warmed
a
solution
of
wine
and
hashish
in
a
green
earthenware
bowl
a
single
silver
cup
stood
beside
the
candle
all
this
for
one
lousy
traditore
said
lorenzo
after
he
has
experienced
what
i
have
prepared
for
him
tonight
he
will
no
longer
be
a
traitor
said
daoud
his
very
soul
will
be
mine
and
that
will
be
worth
all
this
he
watched
the
two
silent
black
men
lug
in
the
naked
body
of
sordello
and
he
pointed
to
a
divan
beside
the
pool
gently
they
laid
sordello
there
tilia
caballo
appeared
from
behind
a
curtain
at
a
gesture
from
her
the
two
black
men
bowed
to
daoud
and
left
three
women
followed
tilia
into
the
room
goddesses
whispered
lorenzo
staring
daoud
who
had
chosen
them
agreed
two
of
them
tilia
had
told
him
were
sisters
whose
specialty
was
working
together
with
one
man
they
had
hair
the
color
of
honey
olive
skin
and
grecian
profiles
each
had
a
gold
fillet
in
her
hair
and
wore
a
short
tunic
of
pure
white
linen
each
tunic
left
one
delicate
shoulder
and
one
perfect
breast
exposed
on
orenetta
the
uncovered
side
was
the
right
and
on
caterina
the
left
the
third
woman
was
tall
taller
than
most
men
and
her
bare
shoulders
were
broad
but
her
body
tightly
wrapped
in
a
gown
of
black
silk
that
stopped
just
above
her
breasts
was
magnificently
female
her
long
unbound
hair
was
lustrous
and
black
as
her
gown
her
skin
pale
as
snow
a
gold
collar
that
appeared
to
be
woven
of
spiral
strands
encircled
her
neck
maiga
tilia
said
was
from
hibernia
an
island
west
of
britain
and
she
spoke
no
italian
and
did
not
need
to
daoud
felt
a
fluttering
in
his
chest
as
the
sight
of
the
three
women
and
the
scent
of
the
simmering
wine
brought
back
memories
of
his
own
initiation
at
the
hands
of
the
hashishiyya
it
had
been
the
tartars
indirectly
who
had
made
it
possible
for
him
to
take
that
training
they
had
besieged
and
destroyed
alamut
the
great
persian
fortress
of
the
sheikh
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
and
kicked
him
to
death
after
he
surrendered
the
old
man
surviving
followers
scattered
across
the
lands
of
islam
it
was
inevitable
that
some
of
the
highest
adepts
came
for
protection
to
sultan
qutuz
of
el
kahira
after
they
were
settled
baibars
had
gone
to
them
with
the
proposal
that
certain
mameluke
emirs
be
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
sect
fayum
the
new
sheikh
saw
an
opportunity
to
infiltrate
the
highest
levels
of
the
mamelukes
and
was
only
too
pleased
to
comply
and
so
it
had
come
about
that
daoud
already
trained
by
saadi
to
resist
the
power
of
hashish
passed
through
the
gates
of
paradise
and
learned
in
time
how
to
administer
the
same
experience
to
others
of
course
sordello
after
he
went
through
this
would
be
no
adept
he
would
learn
no
secrets
he
would
be
the
lowest
of
the
low
a
tool
like
the
fedawi
the
devoted
killers
who
were
the
source
of
the
sheikh
power
this
is
a
lucky
man
said
tilia
her
big
mouth
splitting
her
face
in
a
lascivious
grin
he
will
experience
delights
here
tonight
that
many
of
my
most
distinguished
patrons
have
never
enjoyed
his
pleasures
will
be
limited
only
by
what
his
body
can
endure
she
walked
over
to
sordello
asleep
on
the
divan
and
ran
caressing
fingers
down
his
bare
chest
and
belly
and
he
looks
to
be
a
strong
man
for
his
age
these
scars
quite
the
veteran
bravo
eh
though
the
room
seemed
cool
to
daoud
sweat
ran
over
tilia
bare
bosom
down
into
the
deep
square
collar
of
her
purple
gown
her
deadly
pectoral
cross
lay
heavily
against
the
purple
satin
between
her
breasts
she
might
need
that
cross
tonight
daoud
thought
if
anything
went
wrong
with
sordello
i
begin
to
envy
the
man
said
lorenzo
as
he
has
been
up
to
now
surely
you
are
not
such
a
fool
said
daoud
brusquely
but
then
he
thought
lorenzo
had
no
real
idea
what
initiation
into
the
hashishiyya
did
to
a
man
a
few
last
soft
words
of
instruction
to
caterina
orenetta
and
maiga
and
tilia
led
daoud
and
lorenzo
to
a
wall
panel
which
swung
open
at
the
pressure
of
her
finger
on
a
spring
the
room
they
entered
was
as
cool
as
the
one
they
had
just
left
its
large
open
window
covered
over
with
fine
netting
to
let
in
air
and
keep
out
insects
but
it
was
darker
only
a
single
fat
candle
burned
in
a
large
stick
enameled
green
red
and
white
francesca
the
woman
daoud
had
lain
with
on
his
previous
visits
to
tilia
rose
with
a
smile
and
came
to
him
as
daoud
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
she
squeezed
his
fingers
the
polished
carved
beams
that
ran
up
the
walls
and
across
the
ceiling
of
this
room
were
the
same
color
as
francesca
hair
a
dark
brown
opposite
the
window
there
was
a
small
fireplace
dark
and
empty
here
here
and
here
are
the
places
from
which
you
can
watch
what
goes
on
in
there
said
tilia
marching
along
one
wall
and
pointing
to
tiny
circular
openings
each
one
ringed
with
a
little
of
wood
under
each
opening
was
a
couch
and
the
openings
were
low
enough
in
the
wall
so
that
one
could
sit
or
even
lie
down
and
still
look
through
them
the
light
in
this
room
had
to
be
lower
than
in
the
room
where
sordello
was
daoud
realized
or
the
peepholes
would
be
visible
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
francesca
is
here
for
your
pleasure
should
you
find
what
is
happening
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
arousing
said
tilia
dabbing
with
a
handkerchief
at
the
pool
of
sweat
that
kept
forming
at
the
top
of
her
cleavage
it
must
be
her
weight
daoud
thought
that
made
her
perspire
so
much
you
have
thought
of
everything
tilia
said
daoud
there
is
more
she
said
with
a
smile
and
pulled
on
an
embroidered
strip
of
purple
velvet
hanging
from
the
wall
daoud
heard
a
bell
ring
somewhere
beyond
the
wall
then
through
the
door
to
the
outer
gallery
came
two
more
of
tilia
black
servants
the
first
one
bore
a
wide
silver
tray
and
daoud
smelled
a
familiar
and
savory
odor
that
filled
the
air
of
the
room
as
the
servant
laid
the
tray
on
a
round
table
daoud
saw
slices
of
roast
kid
garnished
with
shredded
cheese
on
a
bed
of
rice
with
peppers
roast
yearling
daoud
exclaimed
delighted
he
bit
into
a
sliver
of
kid
it
was
delicious
the
meat
was
accompanied
by
sliced
boiled
lemons
sprinkled
with
nadd
and
scented
with
ambergris
but
where
did
you
learn
to
prepare
such
a
dish
the
stout
little
woman
rolled
her
eyes
there
is
much
you
do
not
know
about
me
if
i
find
you
deserving
i
will
tell
you
one
day
meanwhile
partake
and
you
lorenzo
and
francesca
levantine
cookery
will
not
poison
you
the
second
servant
set
a
platter
of
peaches
and
figs
and
a
flagon
of
kaviyeh
beside
the
lamb
a
good
meal
for
a
long
night
thought
daoud
he
sat
on
one
of
the
couches
to
peer
through
a
peephole
he
could
see
the
three
women
gathered
around
sordello
inert
form
they
were
massaging
him
gently
as
instructed
but
it
would
be
a
while
yet
before
he
woke
and
found
himself
with
three
beautiful
women
every
pleasure
they
gave
him
enhanced
by
hashish
in
the
south
we
know
and
love
saracen
dishes
said
lorenzo
with
a
grin
as
he
licked
his
fingers
after
helping
himself
to
the
kid
but
madama
tilia
am
i
to
have
food
only
shall
i
not
have
a
companion
to
help
me
endure
this
night
work
tilia
reached
up
and
pulled
at
the
end
of
his
grizzled
mustache
only
rarely
does
a
sicilian
bullock
set
foot
in
my
house
i
am
saving
you
for
myself
meraviglioso
lorenzo
exclaimed
instead
of
one
of
the
handmaidens
of
venus
i
shall
have
venus
herself
lorenzo
wit
was
itself
meraviglioso
thought
daoud
but
for
him
something
other
than
the
games
of
venus
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
ever
since
his
angry
words
with
sophia
of
a
few
days
before
he
had
been
troubled
by
the
thought
of
rachel
and
especially
tonight
when
even
as
he
passed
the
time
here
at
tilia
simon
de
gobignon
was
visiting
sophia
sophia
had
been
to
see
rachel
herself
but
had
refused
to
talk
about
her
he
wanted
to
reassure
himself
that
sophia
had
been
wrong
to
condemn
him
and
that
all
was
well
with
the
girl
while
we
wait
tilia
he
said
i
would
have
a
private
word
with
you
when
they
stepped
out
of
the
room
daoud
said
i
want
to
see
rachel
tilia
frowned
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
in
all
honesty
she
is
well
and
happy
and
richer
by
nearly
two
thousand
florins
your
companion
sophia
visited
her
and
found
nothing
amiss
and
the
roast
kid
will
get
cold
two
thousand
florins
nearly
enough
daoud
reckoned
to
buy
a
mansion
like
ugolini
but
what
of
rachel
herself
just
take
me
to
her
madama
when
he
first
saw
rachel
surprised
smile
he
thought
that
she
was
indeed
well
and
happy
as
tilia
had
said
but
then
her
dark
gaze
was
averted
her
straight
brows
drawn
together
in
a
little
frown
she
started
playing
with
the
gold
lace
on
the
hem
of
her
white
satin
gown
daoud
said
well
rachel
you
look
like
a
queen
sitting
there
each
woman
at
tilia
had
her
special
room
daoud
knew
the
hangings
in
rachel
room
were
the
tables
and
chairs
and
the
bedposts
painted
ivory
and
the
canopy
over
the
bed
was
she
sat
in
one
corner
of
the
bed
with
her
legs
curled
under
her
must
have
been
on
this
bed
that
the
tartar
had
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
you
messer
david
she
said
in
a
low
voice
how
can
i
serve
you
she
smiled
at
him
but
his
trained
eye
saw
that
it
was
a
false
smile
and
the
hint
of
defiance
he
had
noticed
on
first
meeting
her
in
rome
was
gone
rachel
i
only
wanted
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
that
you
are
content
here
and
well
treated
her
eyebrows
lifted
slightly
and
she
shrugged
i
have
never
till
now
known
such
comfort
messer
david
daoud
realized
that
he
should
ask
her
about
the
tartar
tilia
herself
had
given
him
an
account
of
rachel
first
night
with
john
chagan
the
pain
daoud
felt
at
hearing
what
he
had
delivered
rachel
to
was
relieved
only
slightly
by
knowing
that
the
tartar
had
been
surprisingly
gentle
with
her
at
first
though
he
had
hated
tilia
for
being
willing
to
risk
rachel
and
impulsively
he
had
resolved
to
kill
john
that
made
him
feel
a
little
better
until
a
moment
later
he
remembered
that
hating
tilia
and
killing
the
tartar
would
be
no
help
whatever
to
rachel
and
he
as
much
as
anyone
was
guilty
of
what
had
happened
to
her
since
john
chagan
first
visit
daoud
knew
he
had
been
back
twice
more
paying
a
thousand
florins
each
time
to
spend
part
of
the
night
with
rachel
he
seemed
much
taken
with
her
and
continued
to
be
careful
and
kindly
in
his
use
of
her
body
tilia
reported
watching
them
tilia
had
learned
nothing
that
daoud
could
use
but
there
were
things
rachel
might
have
noticed
useful
things
tilia
could
not
have
observed
through
a
spy
hole
tonight
i
will
ask
her
for
information
another
one
thing
he
must
know
though
was
whether
tilia
had
been
telling
him
the
truth
have
you
been
hurt
in
any
way
rachel
looked
at
him
looked
away
and
sighed
how
enormous
her
dark
eyes
were
daoud
thought
how
soulful
her
stare
made
him
uncomfortable
and
he
was
thankful
that
she
soon
looked
away
she
kept
on
toying
with
the
hem
of
her
gown
everyone
has
been
very
kind
you
need
not
worry
about
people
hurting
me
after
all
messer
david
you
are
a
merchant
as
my
angelo
was
and
you
understand
that
goods
must
be
kept
in
the
best
possible
condition
to
obtain
the
best
price
everyone
here
understands
that
too
there
was
no
mistaking
the
bitterness
and
despair
in
her
voice
had
he
felt
any
differently
after
the
turks
captured
him
raped
him
beat
him
and
sold
him
in
the
slave
market
you
are
being
given
the
money
you
have
earned
she
nodded
not
looking
up
my
share
is
five
hundred
florins
for
each
of
his
visits
and
he
gave
me
a
purse
of
three
hundred
the
first
time
a
bonus
because
i
was
a
virgin
madama
tilia
keeps
it
for
me
but
i
am
allowed
to
look
at
it
and
count
it
she
looked
up
suddenly
and
said
earnestly
i
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
than
madama
tilia
but
there
was
a
deadness
in
her
eyes
that
belied
what
she
said
we
did
not
force
you
to
give
yourself
to
the
tartar
he
burst
out
a
light
came
into
her
eyes
then
the
fire
of
anger
thank
you
for
reminding
me
that
i
became
a
whore
of
my
own
free
will
is
that
why
you
came
to
see
me
messer
david
to
tell
me
that
this
is
all
my
own
fault
her
lips
stretched
in
a
ferocious
grin
pay
me
enough
and
i
will
say
anything
you
want
to
hear
rachel
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
and
his
on
hers
and
they
stayed
that
way
frozen
until
daoud
shut
his
eyes
and
slowly
turned
away
he
could
not
even
think
of
a
word
to
say
in
farewell
as
he
closed
the
door
to
her
room
behind
him
his
eyes
burned
and
there
was
an
aching
heaviness
in
his
chest
remorse
he
felt
as
if
he
had
killed
a
child
two
children
not
just
rachel
but
the
boy
david
who
had
always
lived
inside
him
the
pain
was
unbearable
he
longed
to
escape
it
xxxi
tilia
eyed
daoud
apprehensively
is
it
not
as
i
have
said
she
is
well
and
happy
she
lifted
the
pectoral
cross
to
raise
its
gold
chain
away
from
her
bosom
and
mop
her
flesh
with
a
square
of
pale
green
silk
he
remembered
the
blade
in
the
cross
and
wondered
if
she
was
afraid
he
might
attack
her
he
wished
he
could
hate
her
for
what
had
happened
to
rachel
but
all
tilia
had
done
was
introduce
rachel
to
a
way
of
life
that
tilia
herself
had
found
rewarding
she
is
as
well
as
i
could
have
hoped
he
said
hearing
in
his
own
voice
the
deadness
he
had
heard
in
rachel
he
sat
down
heavily
on
a
divan
lorenzo
looked
at
him
searchingly
his
big
mustache
hid
his
mouth
when
it
was
in
repose
but
his
eyes
were
wide
and
they
glistened
wetly
in
the
light
of
the
one
candle
that
illuminated
this
small
room
the
sicilian
hands
lay
limp
in
his
lap
the
hands
of
a
man
in
pain
and
unable
to
do
anything
about
it
through
a
peephole
daoud
saw
that
sordello
had
awakened
the
bravo
was
staring
about
him
in
wonder
only
six
feet
away
from
eye
while
maiga
gently
pressed
his
shoulders
back
against
the
divan
orenetta
stroked
his
chest
and
whispered
to
him
and
caterina
blond
head
rose
and
fell
between
his
legs
francesca
sat
on
the
divan
beside
daoud
offering
him
a
slice
of
kid
he
took
it
and
chewed
it
but
even
though
tilia
had
cooked
and
seasoned
it
perfectly
it
was
tasteless
to
him
it
was
not
only
rachel
fate
that
troubled
him
he
realized
it
was
what
was
happening
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
those
three
lovely
women
ministering
like
houris
of
paradise
to
that
old
ruffian
they
would
do
it
with
skill
and
even
with
the
appearance
of
enthusiasm
because
they
had
no
choice
they
did
not
even
think
of
choosing
they
just
did
as
they
were
told
their
orders
came
through
tilia
from
daoud
francesca
here
beside
him
would
do
whatever
he
wanted
not
because
it
was
what
wanted
but
because
she
too
had
no
choice
and
he
had
never
really
thought
what
it
meant
for
women
to
live
this
way
until
he
saw
tonight
what
had
happened
to
rachel
is
a
sheikh
saadi
used
to
say
each
human
soul
a
spark
from
that
flame
when
we
treat
our
brother
or
sister
like
a
thing
we
trample
god
they
were
all
slaves
in
this
house
of
tilia
he
had
sent
rachel
here
to
become
a
slave
too
was
once
a
but
as
a
mameluke
he
was
free
these
women
did
not
have
that
way
of
escape
as
long
as
they
could
they
must
perform
the
act
of
love
as
it
was
called
with
whoever
paid
them
or
starve
baibars
had
done
well
to
close
the
brothels
of
el
kahira
it
was
the
very
meaning
of
love
that
it
was
freely
given
love
was
free
submission
to
another
just
as
islam
was
free
submission
to
god
daoud
had
first
experienced
love
when
he
and
nicetas
gave
their
bodies
to
each
other
and
later
with
blossoming
reed
even
though
theirs
was
an
arranged
marriage
that
too
was
love
he
could
not
lie
with
francesca
tonight
it
would
be
too
much
like
lying
with
rachel
he
could
not
watch
what
orenetta
caterina
and
maiga
would
do
with
sordello
the
thing
he
was
having
them
do
to
sordello
was
an
abomination
despicable
though
sordello
was
he
too
had
a
soul
and
tonight
daoud
was
trampling
upon
god
in
the
person
of
sordello
and
yet
he
must
see
that
all
went
as
planned
tonight
did
he
want
his
homeland
destroyed
i
have
to
get
away
from
he
stood
up
suddenly
i
must
go
back
to
cardinal
ugolini
tilia
lorenzo
and
francesca
stared
at
him
tilia
recovered
first
but
you
were
to
stay
the
night
here
what
about
she
gestured
toward
the
wall
daoud
shook
his
head
i
am
not
needed
and
i
have
an
important
matter
to
discuss
with
ugolini
which
you
just
remembered
lorenzo
said
eyeing
him
sourly
daoud
pressed
his
lips
together
those
three
women
know
what
to
do
there
is
no
need
for
anyone
to
intervene
unless
he
starts
to
resist
and
then
you
can
kill
him
as
easily
as
i
can
lorenzo
stood
up
and
bowed
formally
thank
you
for
your
trust
messere
i
am
right
in
thinking
that
he
hates
this
as
much
as
i
do
then
he
hates
me
for
making
him
stay
the
thump
of
daoud
boots
on
the
cobblestones
echoed
against
the
fronts
of
the
huddled
houses
armed
with
sword
and
dagger
his
head
clear
and
keeping
to
the
wider
streets
daoud
felt
safe
from
attack
even
though
it
was
well
past
midnight
besides
the
filippeschi
had
been
won
over
so
he
need
no
longer
fear
them
fear
he
thought
was
the
wrong
word
for
it
tonight
he
would
welcome
battle
and
he
had
the
scorpion
with
him
tonight
he
no
longer
ever
made
the
mistake
of
going
about
in
the
streets
of
orvieto
at
night
without
carrying
the
scorpion
in
a
concealed
pocket
in
his
cloak
he
walked
past
the
cathedral
church
of
san
giovenale
and
once
again
from
the
open
doors
heard
the
pale
voices
of
the
priests
of
the
cathedral
chapter
a
heavy
odor
of
incense
carried
on
the
moist
night
air
filled
his
nostrils
pain
crushed
his
heart
as
he
passed
beyond
the
pool
of
light
that
spilled
out
the
cathedral
door
he
seemed
to
feel
a
heavy
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
up
conjured
up
from
memory
his
blond
father
appeared
to
tower
over
him
a
red
cross
on
the
shoulder
of
his
white
mantle
a
warm
hand
gripped
daoud
and
his
mother
her
hair
bound
with
pearls
smiled
down
at
him
her
dress
was
blue
like
the
dress
she
had
died
in
memories
torment
he
wondered
just
ahead
of
him
the
narrow
street
opened
into
the
broader
one
that
ran
past
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
he
had
just
passed
an
inn
called
vesuvio
after
the
burning
mountain
near
napoli
when
a
door
opened
softly
behind
him
very
softly
but
it
did
not
escape
his
trained
ear
he
glanced
back
and
saw
the
upper
half
of
a
divided
door
mate
with
its
lower
half
for
me
that
was
unlikely
because
a
spy
watching
for
him
would
have
had
no
idea
when
to
expect
him
and
would
have
had
to
stand
by
that
door
all
night
he
looked
back
again
at
the
doorway
and
then
at
the
cardinal
residence
the
street
was
wide
enough
to
allow
a
person
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
inn
a
good
view
of
the
front
of
the
mansion
he
walked
out
into
the
square
and
turned
to
the
right
so
that
he
could
no
longer
be
seen
from
the
inn
behind
a
filmy
curtain
on
the
third
story
of
the
mansion
shone
a
yellow
glow
sophia
room
was
that
simon
de
gobignon
in
the
inn
doorway
no
it
was
not
because
now
he
saw
de
gobignon
the
unmistakable
tall
figure
was
standing
in
the
candlelit
window
behind
the
curtain
a
thin
arm
pushed
the
curtain
back
and
though
the
light
was
behind
de
gobignon
daoud
could
see
the
frenchman
plainly
looking
down
into
the
square
even
though
he
was
sure
de
gobignon
could
not
see
him
daoud
stepped
farther
back
into
the
shadows
de
gobignon
in
sophia
room
daoud
clenched
his
fists
and
his
lips
drew
back
in
a
snarl
the
scorpion
would
not
carry
that
far
no
but
he
could
stride
closer
in
an
instant
aim
at
that
spidery
figure
silhouetted
against
lighted
window
and
bring
down
his
enemy
with
a
single
bolt
am
i
thinking
such
a
thing
was
he
going
mad
sophia
would
let
simon
make
love
to
her
and
in
his
passion
he
would
tell
her
much
perhaps
daoud
could
find
out
more
about
why
simon
had
sent
sordello
into
his
camp
perhaps
simon
would
give
sophia
some
hint
about
the
countermove
he
must
be
planning
meanwhile
sophia
would
trick
simon
into
thinking
that
fra
tomasso
had
turned
against
the
alliance
killing
simon
would
be
foolishness
until
now
the
mishaps
that
had
befallen
the
french
and
the
tartars
had
seemed
accidental
murder
simon
and
his
enemies
would
have
proof
that
there
were
plotters
in
orvieto
and
they
would
seek
them
out
and
the
first
place
they
would
look
would
be
the
place
where
simon
was
killed
the
establishment
of
cardinal
ugolini
the
chief
opponent
of
the
alliance
still
daoud
felt
his
blood
seethe
he
remembered
a
summer
night
over
ten
years
before
when
he
had
bribed
a
slave
and
slipped
through
an
unlocked
gate
into
the
arms
of
ayesha
the
young
wife
of
emir
tughril
then
his
commanding
officer
they
had
lain
together
all
that
night
on
the
roof
of
the
mansion
of
tughril
bathed
in
sweat
and
the
sweet
terror
of
the
blades
that
would
hew
his
naked
body
to
pieces
if
they
were
discovered
goaded
him
into
plunging
into
her
again
and
again
only
the
moon
and
stars
bore
witness
that
he
was
enjoying
the
wife
of
his
commander
the
man
who
ordered
him
about
and
punished
him
when
he
made
an
error
the
man
who
had
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
him
toward
dawn
the
delight
of
it
bubbled
up
in
his
throat
and
he
laughed
so
loudly
that
the
small
circassian
girl
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
now
he
does
to
me
that
which
i
did
to
tughril
daoud
shook
his
head
nonsense
sophia
was
not
his
wife
and
it
was
for
this
very
purpose
to
seduce
corrupt
and
spy
upon
the
enemy
that
he
had
brought
her
here
use
her
as
i
used
rachel
and
the
women
at
tilia
first
the
tartar
took
rachel
and
now
de
gobignon
takes
sophia
and
i
am
nothing
but
a
slave
and
a
a
second
silhouetted
figure
appeared
beside
simon
much
shorter
with
unbound
hair
falling
in
waves
and
a
narrow
waist
daoud
saw
sophia
rest
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
moment
later
she
took
the
frenchman
hand
and
they
both
turned
away
from
the
window
the
curtain
fell
back
in
place
behind
them
leads
him
to
bed
daoud
was
shaking
with
rage
every
muscle
in
his
body
ached
to
kill
de
gobignon
god
give
me
the
chance
to
destroy
him
he
heard
another
sound
to
his
left
the
scrape
of
a
boot
on
cobblestones
his
hand
darting
to
his
sword
he
glanced
toward
the
street
he
had
just
passed
through
nothing
de
gobignon
had
brought
a
friend
or
servant
with
him
the
friend
was
waiting
at
that
inn
where
he
could
watch
the
front
of
mansion
and
perhaps
signal
to
de
gobignon
as
dawn
approached
de
gobignon
friend
had
been
watching
daoud
he
must
be
all
in
a
sweat
knowing
that
daoud
had
seen
the
young
count
in
sophia
window
he
would
expect
daoud
to
raise
an
alarm
and
if
daoud
did
not
then
de
gobignon
would
guess
that
david
of
trebizond
simon
making
love
to
the
cardinal
niece
and
from
that
it
would
only
be
a
step
to
realizing
that
david
and
sophia
must
be
plotting
together
it
would
extinguish
any
suspicion
of
sophia
the
count
might
have
if
daoud
were
to
rush
into
the
mansion
raise
an
alarm
and
pursue
simon
but
if
de
gobignon
were
caught
it
would
mean
a
scandal
his
french
compatriots
would
certainly
do
all
they
could
to
stop
him
from
seeing
sophia
again
again
daoud
heard
the
scrape
of
a
boot
sole
on
the
stone
of
the
street
he
drew
farther
back
under
the
overhanging
upper
story
of
a
house
facing
the
mansion
now
de
gobignon
man
could
not
see
him
without
showing
himself
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
and
it
gave
daoud
grim
satisfaction
to
realize
it
can
not
kill
simon
de
gobignon
but
i
have
to
kill
his
he
drew
the
scorpion
from
its
pocket
in
the
hem
of
his
cloak
quickly
and
silently
he
unfolded
it
a
leather
case
held
a
sting
for
the
scorpion
a
steel
dart
half
again
as
long
as
his
finger
coated
with
the
same
paste
he
had
used
to
render
sordello
unconscious
he
pulled
the
string
of
twisted
rawhide
back
with
his
fist
slipped
the
dart
into
place
the
frank
took
a
step
out
of
hiding
daoud
saw
him
as
a
big
shadow
at
the
corner
of
the
building
he
imagined
the
frank
thoughts
he
must
be
trying
desperately
to
think
of
some
way
to
warn
his
master
before
the
cardinal
guards
were
roused
daoud
raised
the
scorpion
but
the
darkness
made
the
shot
difficult
de
gobignon
man
was
too
hard
to
see
messire
he
said
in
the
language
he
had
not
used
since
he
was
ten
i
have
a
message
for
monseigneur
the
count
de
gobignon
he
spoke
in
as
casual
and
friendly
a
tone
as
he
could
muster
daoud
was
close
enough
now
to
see
that
the
man
hand
was
on
his
sword
hilt
why
do
you
speak
of
the
count
to
me
the
voice
was
young
because
you
are
his
man
said
daoud
and
he
thumbed
the
notched
wheel
that
held
the
bowstring
in
place
the
string
thrummed
the
dowels
sprang
forward
and
the
dart
buried
itself
in
the
frenchman
body
to
avoid
hitting
breastbone
or
rib
daoud
had
aimed
for
the
stomach
the
frank
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
anger
and
his
left
hand
clutched
at
his
middle
as
his
right
hand
drew
his
sword
you
greek
bastard
he
groaned
and
fell
first
to
his
knees
then
on
his
face
so
he
had
recognized
him
as
david
of
trebizond
he
must
surely
die
daoud
rolled
the
unconscious
man
over
on
his
back
his
fingers
quickly
found
the
dart
just
a
bit
of
it
protruded
from
the
frank
stomach
his
fall
had
driven
it
deeper
daoud
pulled
the
dart
out
keeping
his
finger
on
the
wound
he
laid
the
dart
on
the
ground
and
drew
his
dagger
he
drove
it
upward
just
below
the
breastbone
striking
the
heart
the
torso
jerked
violently
the
body
trying
to
save
itself
even
though
the
mind
was
asleep
as
daoud
pulled
the
blade
out
blood
flowed
out
after
it
warm
on
his
hand
he
whispered
a
curse
and
wiped
his
hand
and
his
blade
on
the
man
tunic
this
must
look
like
a
street
stabbing
a
man
murdered
for
his
purse
daoud
thrust
his
dagger
into
the
body
again
this
time
in
the
place
where
the
dart
had
gone
in
he
felt
for
a
heartbeat
and
found
none
he
sheathed
his
dagger
felt
for
the
dart
on
the
street
beside
the
frank
and
put
it
back
in
its
case
case
and
scorpion
went
back
in
the
hidden
pocket
in
his
cloak
the
frank
dead
body
was
heavy
as
he
dragged
it
into
the
deeper
darkness
under
the
overhang
of
the
nearest
house
he
fumbled
about
the
dead
man
until
he
found
his
purse
a
small
one
and
not
very
heavy
and
tucked
it
into
his
own
belt
the
pottery
maker
would
be
shocked
in
the
morning
to
find
a
robbed
and
murdered
man
on
his
doorstep
had
anyone
seen
the
houses
around
the
square
were
dark
and
silent
as
so
many
stone
tombs
there
was
only
that
one
light
in
the
window
of
ugolini
mansion
he
could
not
enter
the
mansion
now
with
blood
on
him
whoever
unlocked
the
gate
for
him
would
be
sure
to
connect
him
with
the
murdered
man
who
would
be
found
in
the
morning
orvieto
authorities
would
be
questioning
everyone
and
ugolini
could
not
control
what
his
servants
might
say
back
to
tilia
then
he
chose
another
street
leading
out
of
the
square
so
as
not
to
pass
the
inn
where
de
gobignon
man
had
been
on
watch
as
he
walked
he
cast
his
mind
back
over
what
he
had
done
the
killing
left
him
troubled
saadi
had
taught
him
never
to
waste
human
life
wage
war
is
a
holy
obligation
but
have
a
care
that
you
kill
not
with
a
small
soul
but
with
a
great
this
had
been
a
necessary
murder
daoud
thought
this
young
frank
had
to
die
that
islam
might
be
saved
from
infidel
hordes
of
east
and
west
but
looking
into
his
heart
daoud
knew
that
he
had
indeed
killed
with
a
small
soul
he
had
been
forced
to
kill
de
gobignon
man
but
he
had
also
wanted
to
and
he
had
felt
unworthy
triumph
over
simon
de
gobignon
it
had
not
even
been
an
honorable
fight
the
frank
had
no
chance
my
heart
oh
he
prayed
as
he
walked
back
to
tilia
caballo
brothel
xxxii
simon
remembered
those
kisses
in
the
garden
of
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
as
he
looked
again
at
sophia
and
his
arms
ached
to
hold
her
but
he
must
keep
himself
in
check
he
was
still
not
sure
he
could
trust
her
and
even
if
he
were
certain
of
her
honesty
courtly
love
commanded
him
not
to
touch
her
until
months
perhaps
years
of
worshipful
wooing
had
passed
sophia
said
i
must
tell
my
uncle
that
his
mansion
is
not
as
well
protected
as
he
thinks
it
is
his
guards
must
have
been
asleep
tonight
her
oval
face
reflected
the
warm
glow
of
the
five
or
six
small
candles
she
had
placed
around
her
room
her
dark
brown
hair
was
unbound
and
fell
in
waves
to
her
shoulders
he
felt
his
heartbeat
quicken
as
he
looked
at
her
you
did
invite
me
here
madonna
simon
felt
rather
proud
of
the
way
he
had
scaled
the
wall
by
the
courtyard
gate
waited
till
the
guards
were
out
of
sight
then
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
central
wing
yes
but
i
did
nothing
to
help
you
and
i
truly
do
not
see
how
you
got
here
she
stood
facing
him
her
hands
at
her
sides
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
gown
she
wore
was
for
bed
or
for
him
or
both
it
was
a
translucent
white
tunic
sleeveless
and
cut
deep
in
front
revealing
the
swelling
of
her
breasts
pulled
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
a
large
gold
medallion
stamped
with
a
horse
head
hung
from
a
gold
chain
around
her
neck
his
eyes
kept
traveling
from
her
shoulders
to
her
bosom
to
her
narrow
waist
the
effort
of
holding
himself
back
from
touching
her
was
agony
sweet
agony
i
am
trained
in
the
art
of
stealing
into
castles
i
thought
the
french
were
more
given
to
marching
up
to
a
castello
in
broad
daylight
banners
flying
and
taking
it
by
storm
she
said
her
teeth
flashed
in
the
candlelight
he
wished
she
would
invite
him
to
sit
down
but
then
he
saw
in
what
she
said
an
opportunity
to
raise
the
subject
of
trust
true
madonna
we
french
excel
at
open
warfare
whereas
you
italians
seem
more
adept
at
intrigue
intrigue
what
do
you
mean
he
tried
to
sound
lighthearted
oh
for
instance
the
clever
way
you
diverted
my
attention
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
while
david
of
trebizond
had
the
tartar
ambassadors
making
fools
of
themselves
for
a
moment
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
abruptly
i
bid
you
good
night
your
signory
he
drew
back
shocked
madonna
the
same
way
you
came
will
see
you
out
i
but
meant
to
praise
your
skill
at
diplomacy
i
hope
i
have
not
given
offense
a
gentleman
always
when
he
is
giving
offense
i
i
merely
wish
to
clear
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
simon
stammered
he
cursed
himself
for
his
attempt
to
test
her
it
was
true
the
french
were
no
good
at
intrigue
rest
your
mind
somewhere
else
she
went
to
the
door
and
stood
there
back
to
him
was
she
going
to
call
for
help
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
if
he
were
caught
here
the
beautiful
curve
of
her
back
distracted
and
confused
him
still
more
if
you
do
not
leave
i
will
said
sophia
grasping
the
black
iron
door
handle
you
may
stay
in
this
room
forever
if
you
wish
a
brouillement
i
have
made
of
this
casting
about
frantically
in
his
mind
simon
wondered
what
his
troubadour
father
roland
would
have
done
sire
tristan
or
sire
gawain
what
would
they
do
now
there
was
no
more
time
to
think
he
must
act
he
threw
himself
to
his
knees
arms
outstretched
and
waited
a
long
silent
moment
passed
finally
sophia
turned
her
head
her
lips
those
tender
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
widened
she
turned
all
the
way
around
she
started
to
laugh
laugh
at
me
if
you
will
but
do
not
cast
me
out
the
sound
of
her
laughter
was
like
the
chiming
of
a
bell
after
a
moment
she
stopped
laughing
and
smiled
a
lovely
smile
he
thought
a
kindly
smile
he
could
happily
kneel
here
for
as
long
as
she
went
on
smiling
i
have
never
had
a
man
kneel
to
me
before
a
faint
vexation
flickered
across
her
face
first
you
accuse
me
of
kissing
you
only
to
further
my
uncle
plots
against
the
tartars
then
you
kneel
to
me
what
am
i
to
make
of
you
relief
swept
over
him
as
he
realized
she
was
no
longer
angry
make
me
your
slave
my
slave
you
are
toying
with
me
your
signory
toying
with
you
never
call
me
simon
if
it
please
you
you
would
be
my
friend
i
would
be
more
than
your
friend
madonna
she
came
to
him
and
held
out
her
hands
her
smile
was
dazzling
well
then
simon
you
may
call
me
sophia
and
you
may
rise
simon
grasped
her
hands
feeling
joy
in
his
very
fingertips
he
vaulted
to
his
feet
and
thought
of
taking
her
in
his
arms
but
she
freed
her
hands
with
a
quick
unexpected
motion
and
took
a
step
backward
just
a
movement
of
her
hands
she
can
lift
me
up
or
cast
me
for
a
man
to
kneel
to
a
woman
is
not
the
custom
in
sicily
simon
she
said
softly
it
was
as
he
suspected
she
was
not
familiar
with
the
ways
of
courtly
love
if
i
do
anything
that
seems
strange
to
you
sophia
he
used
her
name
for
the
first
time
and
it
thrilled
him
know
that
my
actions
are
ruled
by
what
we
call
courtois
which
means
that
we
know
how
to
value
women
whose
value
is
beyond
price
i
have
heard
of
courtly
love
it
sounds
blasphemous
to
me
almost
as
if
the
man
worships
the
woman
i
do
not
think
your
patron
saint
would
approve
my
patron
saint
him
she
pointed
to
the
small
painting
in
a
gilt
wooden
case
that
stood
open
on
a
large
black
chest
candles
in
heavy
enamel
sticks
stood
on
either
side
of
the
painting
sophia
took
his
hand
at
the
touch
of
her
cool
fingers
the
muscles
of
his
arms
tensed
she
led
him
across
the
room
still
holding
his
hand
she
spread
the
wings
of
the
case
wider
apart
so
he
could
see
the
image
that
it
was
a
saint
was
apparent
at
once
from
the
aureole
of
gold
paint
encircling
the
black
hair
simon
saw
a
narrow
face
with
huge
staring
blue
eyes
painted
with
such
bright
paint
they
looked
like
sapphires
compared
with
the
saint
eyes
the
sky
behind
his
head
seemed
pale
there
were
purplish
shadows
under
the
eyes
and
the
cheeks
curved
inward
like
those
of
a
starving
man
the
beard
and
mustache
hung
straight
but
were
ragged
at
the
ends
and
what
little
could
be
seen
of
the
robe
was
gray
to
the
left
of
the
halo
in
the
background
stood
a
fluted
ivory
pillar
with
a
square
base
and
a
flaring
top
the
pillar
connected
the
azure
sky
and
ochre
ground
simon
felt
admiration
for
the
face
in
that
desolate
scene
the
saint
must
have
endured
great
privation
and
come
through
with
holy
wisdom
a
wonderful
face
he
said
turning
to
sophia
with
a
smile
and
you
say
this
is
my
patron
saint
simon
of
the
desert
she
said
simon
stylites
stylites
what
does
that
mean
i
do
not
know
greek
neither
do
i
she
said
but
a
priest
told
me
that
his
name
means
of
the
pillar
saint
simon
was
a
hermit
who
lived
ages
ago
when
the
church
was
young
he
dwelt
and
prayed
for
thirty
years
on
top
of
a
pillar
that
was
all
that
was
left
of
an
ancient
pagan
temple
that
is
the
pillar
behind
him
live
on
top
of
a
pillar
for
thirty
years
questions
crowded
into
mind
how
did
he
keep
from
falling
off
when
he
slept
would
not
the
burning
desert
sun
have
killed
him
how
did
he
get
food
and
water
after
thirty
years
the
pillar
ought
to
be
surrounded
by
quite
a
pile
of
no
he
put
that
thought
firmly
out
of
his
mind
after
all
the
whole
point
about
saints
was
that
they
were
not
subject
to
natural
laws
he
asked
only
one
question
how
high
was
the
pillar
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
so
high
that
he
had
to
climb
a
ladder
to
get
to
the
top
then
his
disciples
took
the
ladder
away
she
pointed
at
the
pillar
in
the
painting
i
tried
to
paint
it
so
that
it
could
be
any
height
you
might
imagine
painted
this
you
find
that
hard
to
believe
she
said
with
amused
resignation
that
is
why
i
hardly
ever
tell
anyone
many
people
would
be
sure
i
was
lying
others
would
think
that
a
woman
who
paints
is
some
kind
of
freak
or
that
it
is
somehow
dishonorable
for
a
lady
to
paint
as
if
you
for
instance
were
to
engage
in
trade
what
do
you
think
i
think
god
has
given
you
a
very
great
gift
said
simon
solemnly
she
squeezed
his
hand
giving
him
exquisite
pleasure
and
then
to
his
sorrow
let
it
go
i
hoped
you
would
understand
she
put
the
candlestick
down
and
saint
simon
stylites
receded
into
the
shadows
i
knew
that
you
were
going
to
be
someone
very
important
in
my
life
when
i
found
out
your
name
is
simon
she
said
i
think
my
saint
wished
us
to
meet
how
sweetly
innocent
she
was
simon
mused
he
was
ashamed
of
the
thoughts
he
had
been
entertaining
about
her
ever
since
they
had
kissed
in
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
garden
over
the
days
and
nights
he
had
gradually
grown
more
and
more
familiar
with
her
in
his
fancy
he
had
thought
about
holding
her
breasts
through
her
gown
then
putting
his
hand
on
the
warm
soft
flesh
had
thought
about
lying
beside
her
in
her
bed
both
of
them
nude
he
had
even
one
cool
night
allowed
himself
to
imagine
entering
her
body
and
lying
very
still
clasped
inside
her
the
ultimate
act
of
courtois
this
had
been
quite
beyond
his
power
of
with
the
women
who
played
at
courtly
love
with
him
in
paris
the
way
sophia
excited
him
it
was
even
less
likely
that
he
could
hold
himself
back
while
remaining
inside
her
for
hours
as
a
true
courtly
lover
was
expected
to
do
and
now
sophia
went
over
to
the
very
bed
he
had
imagined
and
perched
on
it
the
frame
of
the
canopied
bed
was
high
above
the
floor
and
when
sophia
sat
on
it
her
feet
dangled
prettily
reminding
simon
how
much
shorter
than
he
she
was
the
sight
of
her
on
the
bed
made
him
tremble
frightened
by
his
own
passion
there
was
no
one
here
to
protect
this
innocent
girl
from
him
except
himself
sit
with
me
she
said
patting
the
coverlet
beside
her
he
knew
that
the
best
way
to
protect
her
was
to
go
nowhere
near
her
but
he
wanted
desperately
to
sit
beside
her
to
feel
her
hand
in
his
again
to
put
his
arms
around
her
if
i
take
her
in
my
arms
on
her
very
bed
how
can
i
stop
myself
still
she
had
invited
him
to
sit
with
her
and
an
invitation
from
his
lady
was
a
command
he
had
intended
to
sing
a
love
song
to
her
he
had
not
the
skill
at
making
poetry
to
be
a
troubadour
but
he
had
a
good
tenor
voice
and
he
had
learned
dozens
of
troubadour
songs
early
in
life
from
roland
he
had
sung
them
before
he
understood
what
they
meant
because
he
liked
the
sound
of
them
he
bowed
and
went
to
the
bed
he
sat
as
far
from
her
as
possible
will
you
let
me
sing
for
you
when
she
smiled
he
noticed
dimples
appeared
in
her
cheeks
oh
that
would
be
a
pleasure
but
softly
please
we
do
not
want
to
rouse
my
uncle
servants
softly
then
he
sang
my
love
is
the
flower
that
opens
at
morning
that
greets
with
her
petals
the
radiant
sun
yet
methinks
is
not
she
who
lives
by
the
sun
but
the
sun
gives
its
light
so
my
lady
may
shine
sophia
smile
was
itself
sunny
as
he
finished
the
first
verse
she
leaned
back
putting
her
hands
out
behind
her
on
the
bed
and
closed
her
eyes
as
he
sang
the
second
and
third
when
he
began
the
fourth
verse
she
drew
closer
to
him
till
their
legs
were
touching
making
himself
concentrate
on
his
music
he
went
on
to
the
fifth
verse
he
resolved
that
at
the
end
of
it
he
would
stand
up
and
move
away
at
sunset
my
love
will
close
up
her
petals
till
with
the
dawn
she
awakens
again
and
her
beauty
will
blaze
out
to
dazzle
the
day
to
see
her
the
sun
will
be
eager
to
rise
by
the
end
of
that
verse
she
was
leaning
against
him
and
had
reached
around
behind
him
to
stroke
his
neck
without
his
consciously
willing
it
his
arm
stole
around
her
waist
and
pulled
her
to
him
his
song
he
realized
was
insidious
in
its
power
he
had
thought
only
to
entertain
her
with
his
music
but
he
was
seducing
her
her
head
rested
on
his
shoulder
her
eyes
closed
her
fingers
crept
slowly
delicately
across
the
back
of
his
neck
under
his
hair
sending
thrills
down
his
spine
he
could
not
move
away
from
her
stop
he
whispered
please
stop
are
you
afraid
of
me
she
asked
softly
i
am
afraid
for
both
of
us
you
do
not
know
what
a
raging
fire
a
lovely
woman
like
you
can
kindle
in
a
man
like
me
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
neck
and
let
it
rest
on
his
thigh
that
he
thought
made
it
even
more
difficult
for
him
i
must
tell
you
something
she
said
i
am
not
wholly
innocent
his
heart
felt
a
sudden
chill
how
could
this
dear
creature
be
anything
but
innocent
now
her
hands
were
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
were
cast
down
as
you
surely
know
most
women
past
twenty
unless
they
are
nuns
have
been
married
for
years
you
must
have
wondered
what
i
am
doing
in
orvieto
unmarried
living
with
my
uncle
i
never
thought
about
it
then
are
very
innocent
simon
felt
himself
wilt
inwardly
how
could
he
have
been
so
blind
as
not
to
wonder
why
sophia
was
not
married
she
had
seemed
timeless
to
him
and
attached
to
no
one
even
her
relation
to
the
cardinal
except
that
it
put
her
in
the
enemy
camp
seemed
unimportant
you
have
a
husband
his
voice
was
heavy
with
sorrow
foolish
as
it
was
he
had
dreamed
that
she
might
be
virginal
but
that
made
no
sense
now
that
he
considered
it
the
rule
in
courtly
love
was
to
fall
in
love
with
a
lady
who
was
married
to
someone
else
his
parisian
courtly
lovers
had
been
married
women
if
sophia
were
already
married
that
should
make
it
better
then
why
did
he
feel
so
disappointed
i
was
married
at
fourteen
his
name
was
alessandro
he
died
two
years
later
of
the
damned
fever
that
takes
so
many
of
our
good
sicilian
people
he
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
was
inconsolable
ah
you
are
still
in
mourning
for
him
she
turned
her
hands
over
showing
empty
palms
i
loved
him
so
much
that
i
could
not
think
of
marrying
another
man
in
siracusa
at
length
my
mother
and
father
decided
to
send
me
to
live
with
my
uncle
in
the
hope
that
i
could
forget
alessandro
enough
to
consider
marrying
again
do
you
wish
to
marry
again
i
have
met
no
one
i
am
drawn
to
but
you
simon
and
marriage
between
you
and
me
would
be
unthinkable
my
family
station
is
so
far
beneath
yours
his
heart
leapt
happily
she
was
free
yet
as
she
said
not
wholly
innocent
he
need
not
feel
quite
so
guilty
about
the
passionate
thoughts
he
had
been
having
about
her
and
as
for
marriage
between
them
being
unthinkable
she
did
not
know
that
none
of
the
great
houses
of
france
would
consider
a
daughter
of
theirs
taking
the
name
de
gobignon
her
nonclerical
family
might
be
of
low
station
just
as
the
pope
father
had
been
a
shoemaker
but
sophia
was
the
niece
of
a
cardinal
a
prince
of
the
church
it
was
love
not
thoughts
of
marriage
that
had
brought
him
here
tonight
still
he
must
respect
her
honorable
widowhood
since
she
had
loved
her
husband
she
might
be
more
susceptible
to
him
and
he
must
guard
her
virtue
all
the
more
steadfastly
perhaps
she
thought
that
he
respected
her
less
as
a
widow
he
must
reassure
her
she
was
not
holding
him
any
longer
he
could
stand
up
without
tearing
himself
away
from
her
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
strode
to
the
center
of
the
room
believe
me
i
think
you
just
as
pure
as
if
you
had
never
been
married
at
all
she
looked
up
at
him
surprised
her
hands
still
folded
in
her
lap
her
dark
eyes
wide
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
but
she
cast
her
eyes
down
and
smiled
faintly
does
that
mean
there
is
to
be
nothing
at
all
between
us
i
love
you
simon
declared
i
will
always
love
you
i
think
of
you
night
and
day
i
beg
you
to
love
me
in
return
oh
simon
how
beautiful
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
but
he
stayed
where
he
was
and
raised
his
hands
warningly
i
mean
to
love
you
according
to
the
commandments
of
courtois
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
i
yearn
to
be
altogether
yours
but
you
must
restrain
me
i
must
you
must
be
what
the
poets
of
old
languedoc
called
dons
my
lord
you
must
rule
me
one
day
we
will
join
together
in
body
but
only
after
i
have
been
tested
and
found
worthy
is
that
what
courtly
love
means
yes
and
that
is
why
it
is
more
beautiful
than
marriage
husband
and
wife
may
embrace
carnally
the
moment
the
priest
says
the
words
over
them
no
they
are
to
courtly
lovers
know
each
other
only
when
love
has
fully
prepared
the
way
so
that
their
coming
together
may
be
a
moment
of
perfect
beauty
sophia
looked
at
him
silently
her
face
was
suddenly
unreadable
do
you
understand
he
asked
after
he
had
stood
awhile
gazing
into
her
lustrous
brown
eyes
these
ideas
are
perhaps
new
to
you
the
woman
is
ruler
of
the
man
yes
the
corners
of
her
mouth
quirked
then
what
if
i
were
to
command
you
to
get
into
this
bed
with
me
he
was
certain
from
her
sly
smile
that
she
was
joking
but
he
could
think
of
no
clever
answer
he
considered
what
he
had
read
what
he
had
been
told
what
he
had
done
with
other
women
none
of
it
helped
the
women
who
fell
into
bed
with
him
on
the
first
tryst
had
not
been
serious
about
love
nor
had
he
been
in
all
the
lore
of
courtois
the
woman
made
the
man
wait
sometimes
for
years
sometimes
for
his
entire
life
and
the
man
was
happy
to
wait
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
then
he
remembered
something
his
mother
had
said
a
secret
so
precious
he
would
never
tell
anyone
not
even
sophia
not
even
friar
mathieu
needed
to
know
it
but
it
guided
simon
now
first
time
your
father
and
i
were
alone
together
i
wanted
him
then
and
there
but
he
was
strong
enough
for
both
of
us
it
was
a
whole
year
before
we
possessed
each
other
in
body
and
you
came
of
that
you
will
not
command
me
so
he
said
with
cheerful
confidence
her
eyebrows
rose
they
were
strong
and
dark
like
a
raven
wings
indeed
because
you
know
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
wait
we
both
want
each
other
now
but
if
we
restrain
that
hunger
it
will
grow
it
will
be
not
just
a
desire
of
the
flesh
but
a
longing
of
the
spirit
it
is
said
that
the
souls
in
paradise
know
no
greater
happiness
than
two
lovers
do
who
are
united
in
soul
as
well
as
body
prodigioso
she
said
but
i
am
just
a
sicilian
girl
and
i
do
not
perhaps
have
the
refined
spiritual
appetite
of
a
french
nobleman
what
if
i
can
not
wait
it
is
natural
simon
said
thinking
again
of
what
his
mother
had
confided
to
him
then
i
must
be
strong
enough
for
both
of
us
the
thought
of
her
powerful
passions
which
she
restrained
with
such
difficulty
excited
him
holding
himself
back
from
her
was
going
to
be
painful
but
delightfully
so
and
think
of
the
ecstasy
when
at
last
they
were
united
sophia
released
a
long
sigh
and
brought
the
palms
of
her
hands
down
on
her
knees
with
a
slap
of
finality
so
be
it
simon
you
will
teach
me
the
ways
of
courtly
love
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
be
your
what
did
you
call
it
mi
dons
my
lord
her
teeth
flashed
white
in
the
candlelight
and
her
lips
glistened
simon
own
lips
burned
to
taste
hers
how
strange
as
if
i
were
the
man
ah
but
you
are
very
much
a
man
simon
and
you
make
me
feel
very
much
a
maiden
simon
turned
and
went
to
the
window
the
night
air
blew
through
the
gauze
curtains
and
he
felt
a
wonderful
aliveness
all
over
his
body
he
wondered
whether
alain
out
there
in
the
dark
somewhere
could
see
him
here
in
the
window
he
pushed
the
curtain
aside
so
alain
if
he
was
there
could
get
a
good
look
and
know
that
his
seigneur
was
safe
and
happy
dawn
must
still
be
hours
away
what
would
he
tell
alain
about
what
transpired
this
night
the
truth
assuredly
but
would
alain
believe
him
and
if
he
did
would
he
mock
simon
for
not
bedding
sophia
no
alain
would
understand
he
respected
the
good
in
men
and
women
as
much
as
simon
did
which
was
why
they
were
friends
as
well
as
lord
and
vassal
sophia
stood
beside
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
can
not
stand
there
all
night
simon
come
back
and
sit
down
he
bowed
as
mi
dons
commands
he
let
her
take
his
hand
and
draw
him
away
from
the
window
there
was
one
chair
in
the
room
and
he
took
it
foolish
to
expose
himself
to
temptation
by
sitting
beside
her
on
the
bed
again
the
chair
was
straight
with
a
tall
back
and
no
arms
the
only
touch
of
comfort
in
its
rectilinear
shape
was
a
cushion
laid
upon
its
seat
sophia
smiled
and
shrugged
and
sat
again
on
her
bed
would
she
let
him
spend
the
night
whenever
he
had
been
all
night
with
a
woman
they
had
made
love
should
he
sing
to
her
again
would
she
want
to
sleep
he
pictured
himself
watching
over
her
while
she
slept
perhaps
kneeling
by
her
bedside
and
the
beauty
of
it
thrilled
him
now
he
remembered
something
she
had
said
earlier
that
he
had
accused
her
of
kissing
him
to
further
my
uncle
plots
against
the
she
was
aware
then
of
what
ugolini
was
doing
has
no
idea
how
much
she
revealed
to
he
sang
another
troubadour
song
white
hands
she
let
him
draw
off
her
red
silk
slippers
and
he
almost
cast
away
all
his
promises
to
himself
as
she
curled
her
toes
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
forced
himself
to
stand
up
and
pace
the
room
while
she
lounged
back
on
her
bed
her
head
propped
up
on
her
elbow
watching
him
with
that
delicious
smile
of
hers
she
questioned
him
about
his
life
and
he
offered
her
a
simple
version
of
it
telling
her
nothing
about
his
secret
illegitimacy
and
the
dishonor
of
the
man
whose
name
he
bore
it
struck
him
while
talking
to
her
that
perhaps
these
two
sins
that
had
shaped
his
life
amalric
de
gobignon
treason
and
nicolette
de
gobignon
adultery
had
given
him
the
strength
to
resist
the
temptation
to
assail
sophia
virtue
he
told
her
how
he
had
spent
much
of
his
youth
in
the
household
of
the
king
of
france
and
how
this
had
led
to
count
charles
giving
him
the
task
of
protecting
the
tartar
ambassadors
and
thus
inevitably
their
talk
got
around
to
the
tartars
why
did
you
accept
this
task
from
the
count
of
anjou
she
asked
you
have
a
lofty
title
huge
estates
everything
you
could
want
why
trouble
yourself
with
all
this
intrigue
having
decided
not
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
his
past
simon
now
could
not
answer
her
question
both
honestly
and
fully
he
could
not
say
that
he
had
committed
himself
to
this
mission
to
clear
the
stain
of
treason
from
the
name
of
de
gobignon
and
to
prove
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
title
so
he
told
her
of
another
reason
equally
true
i
am
in
part
an
orphan
and
the
king
was
like
a
second
father
to
me
it
is
his
wish
that
christians
and
tartars
join
together
to
liberate
the
holy
land
and
i
would
do
anything
for
him
sophia
frowned
i
find
that
hard
to
understand
as
for
me
i
hate
the
tartars
simon
mind
pounced
on
that
could
she
be
more
involved
in
scheming
than
she
had
admitted
why
do
you
hate
the
tartars
you
know
so
little
about
them
i
know
that
they
almost
made
enemies
of
us
because
you
thought
i
was
kissing
you
just
to
help
my
uncle
carefully
again
she
was
hinting
at
her
uncle
involvement
in
all
that
had
gone
wrong
for
the
alliance
but
if
he
asked
her
about
it
outright
she
might
think
as
he
had
thought
of
her
that
he
was
courting
her
only
to
further
his
cause
well
i
am
sure
your
uncle
is
following
his
conscience
as
we
all
are
said
simon
actually
he
believed
nothing
of
the
kind
but
he
did
not
want
to
offend
sophia
and
perhaps
courtois
would
permit
a
small
lapse
in
one
bound
to
be
truthful
to
his
lady
and
your
conscience
tells
you
to
guard
those
savages
i
want
to
see
jerusalem
liberated
and
the
saracens
conquered
simon
said
every
good
christian
does
she
sat
up
in
bed
looking
at
him
earnestly
do
you
not
fear
that
the
tartars
are
worse
than
the
saracens
that
is
what
my
uncle
says
step
by
step
as
if
he
were
defending
a
philosophical
proposition
at
the
university
of
paris
simon
explained
to
her
what
he
believed
yes
the
tartars
were
barbarians
and
had
committed
unspeakable
atrocities
but
the
saracens
united
under
the
mameluke
sultan
of
egypt
were
more
powerful
now
than
they
had
been
in
hundreds
of
years
if
not
stopped
now
they
would
sweep
all
the
crusaders
out
of
outremer
the
land
beyond
the
sea
and
a
wave
of
mohammedan
conquests
might
well
not
end
there
to
this
day
the
moors
were
a
power
in
spain
and
it
was
not
that
long
ago
that
there
were
saracens
in
france
and
here
in
italy
surely
she
remembered
that
her
own
island
of
sicily
had
been
conquered
for
a
time
by
the
saracens
indeed
king
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
army
was
made
up
partly
of
saracens
and
he
himself
was
an
infidel
with
their
belief
in
spreading
their
religion
by
the
sword
the
saracens
were
a
far
greater
danger
to
christendom
than
the
tartars
the
tartars
were
simple
pagans
easily
converted
to
christianity
friar
mathieu
had
personally
baptized
over
a
dozen
tartars
she
listened
intently
her
eyes
so
fixed
on
his
that
he
feared
more
than
once
to
lose
his
train
of
thought
but
he
persevered
to
the
end
when
he
finished
she
nodded
thoughtfully
now
he
thought
he
could
turn
the
conversation
to
her
uncle
all
this
is
so
obvious
he
said
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
your
uncle
should
have
formed
a
party
to
oppose
the
alliance
she
touched
her
fingertips
to
her
mouth
in
surprise
that
mouth
it
was
like
a
blooming
rose
you
mean
my
uncle
is
the
of
those
who
are
against
the
alliance
this
reminded
him
of
mornings
he
had
tiptoed
through
his
forest
at
gobignon
longbow
drawn
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
stag
brown
coat
and
then
losing
sight
of
it
again
in
the
thick
broussailles
trying
to
stay
downwind
and
draw
close
enough
for
a
good
shot
without
frightening
the
deer
into
headlong
flight
but
i
thought
you
already
knew
that
he
said
if
she
denied
that
she
knew
any
such
thing
then
his
quarry
had
escaped
him
so
he
put
david
of
trebizond
up
to
baiting
the
tartars
while
you
and
i
were
so
delightfully
engaged
wicked
uncle
to
think
i
almost
lost
you
on
his
account
she
clenched
a
pretty
fist
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
chiseled
in
marble
on
one
finger
her
small
garnet
ring
glittered
in
the
candlelight
i
believe
he
brought
david
of
trebizond
and
his
servant
giancarlo
here
to
orvieto
as
well
as
that
hungarian
knight
sire
cosmas
who
spoke
at
the
pope
council
to
discredit
the
tartars
simon
wondered
whether
he
should
tell
sophia
about
the
bravos
giancarlo
was
recruiting
no
if
he
told
her
what
he
knew
about
them
he
would
have
to
require
her
to
keep
it
a
secret
and
that
might
make
her
feel
disloyal
to
ugolini
she
nodded
now
i
understand
why
he
spends
so
much
time
closeted
with
that
silk
merchant
talking
about
who
is
fra
tomasso
di
di
robe
fra
tomasso
she
nodded
that
was
the
name
he
sent
david
to
see
this
fra
tomasso
and
when
david
came
back
i
overheard
my
uncle
joyfully
shouting
tomasso
is
with
us
over
and
over
again
is
he
an
important
man
this
fra
tomasso
simon
tried
to
keep
his
face
calm
but
he
was
horrified
simon
recalled
now
that
the
family
were
from
southern
italy
the
kingdom
of
manfred
the
unbeliever
as
was
ugolini
and
were
not
the
even
related
to
the
hohenstaufens
something
must
be
done
about
this
at
once
how
far
had
the
plotters
that
was
what
they
were
plotters
gotten
with
how
much
further
dare
he
pursue
this
subject
before
sophia
grew
suspicious
of
him
and
how
much
further
before
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
degrading
their
love
love
but
she
has
not
said
she
loves
the
realization
was
like
a
thunderclap
in
his
mind
what
he
really
wanted
to
know
was
whether
she
loved
him
or
not
to
come
right
out
and
ask
her
was
not
the
way
of
courtly
love
he
must
wait
for
her
to
say
but
she
would
never
speak
of
love
as
long
as
they
went
on
about
the
tartars
and
ugolini
the
devil
with
ugolini
and
david
of
trebizond
and
fra
tomasso
and
the
tartars
he
had
learned
enough
anyway
he
decided
she
had
confirmed
his
suspicion
that
ugolini
was
the
ringleader
of
the
forces
in
orvieto
arrayed
against
the
tartars
she
had
let
him
know
that
they
had
drawn
fra
tomasso
into
their
conspiracy
of
one
thing
he
felt
certain
if
she
were
working
with
her
uncle
to
block
the
alliance
she
would
not
have
let
him
learn
so
much
xxxiii
a
hand
shook
simon
shoulder
his
whole
right
side
ached
he
fought
wakefulness
trying
to
plunge
deeper
into
sleep
he
was
in
a
cool
blue
lake
surrounded
by
dark
masses
of
spruce
he
had
just
seen
a
wolf
with
a
coat
drinking
from
the
lake
on
the
opposite
shore
and
he
was
trying
to
swim
to
it
simon
you
must
wake
up
he
opened
his
eyes
right
before
his
face
was
a
twisting
streak
of
orange
against
a
royal
blue
background
and
he
realized
he
was
lying
on
his
side
on
the
persian
carpet
in
sophia
bedchamber
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
rubbed
his
aching
side
he
saw
sophia
face
just
above
him
he
could
not
help
himself
he
reached
up
with
both
arms
and
pulled
her
down
to
him
and
kissed
her
her
lips
felt
cool
and
dry
and
he
had
a
sudden
fear
that
his
breath
must
be
sour
from
sleep
she
pushed
herself
away
from
him
and
he
did
not
try
to
hold
her
there
is
light
coming
through
the
window
and
i
hear
birds
singing
she
said
you
must
go
now
many
of
my
uncle
servants
get
up
at
dawn
he
sat
up
she
was
kneeling
beside
him
still
wearing
the
same
gown
he
remembered
now
that
they
had
talked
of
courtly
love
and
a
little
about
her
childhood
in
sicily
to
his
disappointment
she
had
not
said
that
she
loved
him
the
necessities
of
nature
had
forced
on
them
an
intimacy
of
one
sort
while
each
had
pretended
not
to
notice
the
other
had
used
the
chamber
pot
discreetly
placed
behind
the
red
and
green
diamonds
of
a
screen
she
had
been
the
first
to
fall
asleep
sleep
had
overtaken
him
too
but
each
time
he
dozed
off
he
started
to
topple
off
the
small
straight
chair
he
was
sitting
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
this
had
happened
he
gave
up
sitting
and
stretched
out
on
the
carpet
quickly
simon
please
if
my
uncle
ever
finds
out
you
were
here
he
will
send
me
back
to
siracusa
forfend
the
habits
of
his
knightly
training
took
over
and
he
strode
quickly
to
the
corner
where
he
had
left
his
sword
and
belt
leaning
against
the
wall
and
buckled
them
on
he
remembered
that
alain
was
supposed
to
sing
an
aubade
a
dawn
song
in
the
street
below
to
warn
and
rouse
him
an
old
troubadour
custom
perhaps
he
had
sung
and
simon
sleeping
so
soundly
had
not
heard
did
you
hear
anyone
singing
out
in
the
street
he
asked
sophia
smiled
and
shook
her
head
alain
he
must
have
overslept
sophia
said
but
how
will
you
get
out
of
here
it
is
not
as
easy
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
as
it
is
to
climb
down
from
it
simon
went
to
the
window
and
pushed
the
curtain
aside
the
rope
he
had
climbed
down
on
was
still
dangling
from
above
he
gave
it
a
hard
pull
and
it
held
firm
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
a
deep
violet
with
only
a
few
faint
stars
and
one
brightly
shining
planet
morning
star
might
be
venus
a
good
omen
for
a
his
heart
was
light
even
though
he
was
leaving
sophia
it
had
been
a
beautiful
night
a
cup
of
wine
stood
on
the
table
by
her
bed
he
swigged
it
to
rinse
his
mouth
swallowed
then
wiped
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
tried
to
think
of
some
parting
word
worthy
of
a
troubadour
but
none
occurred
to
him
she
stood
by
the
bed
her
eyes
warm
he
held
out
his
arms
and
she
slipped
into
them
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
been
lovers
for
years
she
was
so
much
shorter
than
he
that
he
had
to
lean
down
to
kiss
her
and
as
he
did
she
arched
her
body
against
him
i
love
you
he
whispered
embarrassed
by
its
prosaic
simplicity
but
it
was
simple
truth
and
i
love
you
she
kissed
him
quickly
on
the
lips
and
turned
away
her
words
stunned
him
he
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
going
to
fall
dead
on
the
spot
and
that
if
he
did
it
would
be
a
perfect
moment
to
die
the
candles
were
almost
burned
to
the
bottom
he
looked
over
at
the
painting
of
saint
simon
stylites
whose
blue
eyes
seemed
to
gleam
out
at
him
from
the
shadows
he
wrapped
the
rope
around
both
arms
gave
it
another
yank
to
be
sure
it
was
tied
tightly
above
and
stepped
up
on
the
windowsill
he
swung
around
so
that
he
was
facing
the
wall
of
the
mansion
and
began
to
climb
his
joy
at
her
parting
words
making
him
feel
stronger
and
more
agile
his
hands
gripped
the
rough
rope
his
feet
in
calfskin
boots
pressed
against
the
wall
pointed
toes
seeking
out
cracks
he
did
not
look
at
the
street
three
stories
below
he
heard
voices
in
the
street
and
froze
there
were
men
gathered
down
there
if
they
looked
up
they
would
see
him
climbing
up
the
front
of
the
cardinal
mansion
he
told
himself
he
scrambled
up
to
the
square
guelfo
merlon
around
which
his
rope
was
tied
pulled
himself
over
the
parapet
and
dropped
with
relief
to
the
flagstones
of
the
flat
roof
he
untied
the
rope
curiosity
made
him
want
to
look
at
the
men
whose
raised
voices
he
heard
coming
from
across
the
street
something
had
disturbed
them
but
he
had
the
feeling
that
if
he
did
not
look
at
them
they
would
not
see
him
holding
the
loosely
coiled
rope
in
one
gloved
hand
he
ran
as
lightly
as
he
could
so
as
not
to
disturb
anyone
in
the
rooms
below
him
he
came
to
the
back
of
the
building
where
two
stories
below
him
a
crenelated
lower
wall
protecting
the
courtyard
joined
the
main
building
he
uncoiled
the
rope
found
its
center
and
doubled
the
line
around
an
angled
merlon
at
the
corner
of
the
roof
battlements
so
that
both
halves
dangled
down
just
above
the
courtyard
wall
then
gripping
the
doubled
rope
he
swung
himself
out
and
began
to
climb
down
a
thunderous
roar
battered
at
his
ears
he
saw
in
the
courtyard
a
big
gray
hound
racing
over
the
paving
stones
twice
as
fast
as
any
man
could
run
it
kept
up
a
furious
enraged
barking
in
a
deep
voice
in
an
instant
the
dog
was
below
him
its
bellowing
was
sure
to
rouse
the
cardinal
guards
its
huge
pointed
white
teeth
glistened
its
tail
lashed
from
side
to
side
i
fell
that
damned
dog
would
eat
me
he
remembered
seeing
the
dog
before
with
giancarlo
david
of
servant
it
had
been
friendly
enough
that
day
but
now
it
saw
him
as
an
intruder
called
it
by
name
what
the
devil
was
it
if
i
could
speak
its
name
maybe
i
could
get
it
to
shut
simon
stood
on
the
courtyard
wall
thankful
that
it
was
too
high
for
the
dog
to
reach
him
the
hound
sprang
at
the
top
of
the
wall
at
the
same
time
emitting
a
bark
so
loud
it
almost
knocked
simon
off
his
perch
simon
pulled
on
one
end
of
the
rope
and
it
snaked
around
the
merlon
and
came
rippling
down
to
him
to
his
horror
one
end
fell
past
him
into
the
courtyard
in
an
instant
those
great
ivory
fangs
had
sunk
into
the
braided
hemp
simon
yanked
on
the
rope
but
there
was
no
tearing
it
loose
hoping
to
catch
the
dog
by
surprise
simon
gave
the
rope
some
slack
and
then
jerked
with
all
his
might
but
succeeded
only
in
dragging
the
beast
a
foot
or
so
claws
scraping
on
cobblestones
at
least
the
animal
could
not
bite
the
rope
and
bark
at
the
same
time
enraged
muffled
growls
issued
around
its
clenched
teeth
it
snapped
its
head
from
side
to
side
trying
to
tear
the
rope
out
of
simon
hands
he
cut
part
of
the
rope
away
with
his
dagger
letting
the
end
the
dog
held
fall
into
the
courtyard
even
as
he
was
coiling
up
the
rest
of
the
rope
the
beast
gave
a
howl
of
fury
and
with
a
tremendous
leap
was
halfway
up
the
wall
the
remaining
rope
tied
to
his
belt
simon
hung
by
his
hands
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
and
let
himself
drop
hitting
the
stone
street
with
a
thud
that
sent
jolts
of
pain
through
his
shinbones
he
heard
shouts
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
mingling
with
the
roars
of
the
hound
limping
a
little
at
first
from
the
force
of
the
drop
he
staggered
into
the
nearest
side
street
he
would
have
to
circle
back
to
the
avenue
that
ran
in
front
of
the
cardinal
palace
approaching
it
from
another
direction
it
seemed
to
take
hours
for
him
to
find
his
way
through
the
snake
nest
of
byways
but
he
felt
not
the
least
bit
disturbed
it
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
because
sophia
parting
words
to
him
had
been
i
love
he
felt
like
dancing
through
the
crooked
streets
by
the
time
he
emerged
near
the
east
side
of
the
cardinal
palace
he
could
see
quite
clearly
there
was
no
sun
though
the
morning
was
damp
and
gray
he
would
have
to
cross
the
avenue
and
walk
back
past
the
cardinal
mansion
to
find
the
inn
he
and
alain
had
picked
for
their
rendezvous
it
must
be
near
where
that
crowd
of
men
had
formed
a
circle
around
something
are
you
the
watch
messere
a
man
said
coming
up
to
him
as
he
approached
the
crowd
i
am
not
said
simon
with
a
slight
haughtiness
and
the
man
fell
back
eyeing
simon
rich
clothing
sword
and
dagger
scusi
signore
really
should
not
let
myself
be
seen
around
with
deference
to
simon
dress
and
manner
the
crowd
parted
for
him
when
he
joined
them
to
see
what
they
were
looking
at
it
was
the
body
of
a
dead
man
it
was
alain
simon
staggered
back
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
struck
in
the
heart
by
a
mailed
fist
no
he
cried
do
you
know
this
man
signore
someone
asked
him
simon
did
not
answer
he
fell
to
his
knees
beside
alain
horrified
by
the
face
so
white
it
seemed
carved
from
marble
he
saw
now
the
great
bloodstain
down
the
front
of
alain
pale
green
tunic
flies
with
gleaming
bodies
were
humming
above
the
bloodstain
settling
down
again
after
simon
arrival
disturbed
them
he
raised
his
head
and
through
the
tears
that
clouded
his
vision
he
recognized
a
face
last
night
innkeeper
a
short
balding
man
with
large
eyes
and
a
generous
nose
we
have
sent
for
the
watch
your
signory
said
the
man
did
anyone
see
or
hear
anything
my
wife
heard
your
friend
go
out
before
dawn
he
never
came
back
have
mercy
on
thought
simon
is
my
fault
he
went
out
to
await
the
dawn
so
he
could
warn
me
and
someone
killed
tears
were
pouring
from
his
eyes
he
was
sobbing
convulsively
poverello
he
heard
someone
mutter
sympathetically
here
he
was
a
knight
a
count
kneeling
in
the
street
weeping
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
strangers
he
did
not
care
guilt
crushed
him
he
wanted
to
lie
beside
his
friend
body
and
be
dead
with
him
but
how
could
he
no
he
had
to
find
and
kill
murderer
still
kneeling
beside
alain
he
wiped
his
face
with
the
edge
of
his
cape
and
surveyed
the
crowd
to
keep
his
identity
a
secret
seemed
unimportant
now
i
am
the
count
de
gobignon
of
france
i
will
pay
handsomely
anyone
who
helps
me
find
the
man
who
did
this
if
anyone
can
name
the
murderer
i
will
pay
he
thought
a
moment
a
thousand
florins
a
murmuring
ran
through
the
crowd
a
fortune
foolish
perhaps
simon
thought
to
offer
such
a
reward
a
man
would
accuse
his
own
brother
to
get
that
much
money
may
hear
many
names
i
will
have
to
be
he
looked
down
at
poor
alain
the
flies
were
crawling
on
his
face
and
he
brushed
them
away
alain
lips
had
turned
blue
he
looked
for
alain
purse
and
saw
none
on
his
belt
stabbed
to
death
for
the
few
coins
he
carried
dead
at
twenty
years
of
age
tears
overflowed
his
eyes
again
oddly
alain
still
wore
his
sword
and
dagger
alain
weapons
were
still
both
sheathed
whoever
had
stabbed
him
had
not
given
him
time
to
defend
himself
yet
there
were
no
recessed
doorways
or
alley
openings
where
an
armed
robber
might
hide
himself
the
spot
was
unpleasantly
familiar
this
was
where
simon
archers
at
de
verceuil
orders
had
shot
two
orvietans
had
alain
been
tricked
by
someone
pretending
to
be
a
friend
was
the
killer
someone
alain
knew
my
poor
friend
what
a
shame
it
is
when
a
young
knight
dies
without
sword
in
simon
clenched
his
fist
the
tears
falling
unceasingly
the
wounds
in
christ
body
i
swear
i
will
avenge
the
wounds
that
killed
you
simon
remembered
now
that
the
watch
was
on
the
way
when
they
got
here
they
would
ask
him
questions
about
what
he
and
alain
were
doing
here
questions
he
did
not
want
to
answer
until
he
had
time
to
think
scandal
would
give
de
verceuil
a
chance
to
eat
me
alive
and
i
must
get
friar
mathieu
to
help
send
someone
to
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
for
my
horse
he
said
to
the
innkeeper
standing
suddenly
as
you
wish
your
signory
the
innkeeper
hurried
off
simon
swept
the
crowd
with
his
gaze
remember
all
of
you
anyone
who
saw
anything
heard
anything
you
will
be
paid
come
to
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
simon
sat
down
on
the
stone
street
to
wait
for
the
horse
silently
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
waited
with
him
when
the
innkeeper
servant
brought
the
horse
simon
lifted
body
with
the
help
of
two
other
men
and
lashed
it
securely
facedown
over
his
horse
back
with
the
rope
he
had
used
to
climb
to
sophia
room
he
had
been
so
happy
just
moments
ago
because
she
said
she
loved
him
as
they
parted
was
she
looking
down
now
seeing
this
pitiful
sight
fresh
sobs
forced
their
way
into
his
throat
and
he
leaned
against
his
horse
covering
his
face
with
his
arms
have
to
get
away
from
here
he
forced
himself
to
stop
crying
and
took
hold
of
the
reins
the
orvietans
fell
back
as
he
led
the
horse
up
the
street
leading
northward
to
the
monaldeschi
palace
he
felt
warmth
on
his
neck
and
looked
up
to
see
the
sun
through
a
break
in
the
clouds
alain
would
never
see
the
sun
again
did
this
to
you
alain
i
will
not
rest
until
i
have
killed
him
with
my
own
xxxiv
sordello
face
looking
as
if
hewn
from
granite
by
an
indifferent
sculptor
was
gray
with
fatigue
his
arms
bound
behind
his
back
he
knelt
before
daoud
wearing
a
tattered
brown
frieze
robe
tilia
had
somewhere
found
for
him
daoud
sat
once
again
on
the
former
papal
throne
dressed
in
black
cassocks
and
hoods
that
covered
their
faces
lorenzo
and
five
of
black
servants
stood
along
the
walls
of
the
room
every
so
often
sordello
eyes
flickered
to
the
implements
of
torture
around
the
room
and
quickly
away
again
yet
the
night
assault
on
his
mind
had
not
altogether
broken
his
spirit
if
you
think
to
frighten
me
with
this
clowning
think
again
messer
david
i
have
stood
undaunted
before
the
inquisition
in
my
day
and
they
are
a
good
deal
more
fearsome
than
you
and
your
henchmen
him
his
shred
of
daoud
thought
man
who
has
lost
that
is
too
we
are
beyond
fear
now
sordello
are
we
not
sordello
eyes
glowed
in
the
torchlight
like
a
trapped
animal
what
kind
of
devil
are
you
daoud
tried
to
smile
kindly
you
call
me
a
devil
after
i
have
sent
you
to
paradise
the
old
bravo
sighed
and
his
eyes
closed
i
did
not
know
that
my
body
was
capable
of
feeling
so
much
pleasure
even
when
i
was
twenty
and
at
my
best
i
never
knew
such
delight
it
shook
me
to
the
very
root
of
my
soul
i
know
said
daoud
he
was
thinking
back
to
his
own
initiation
given
sanctuary
in
egypt
the
hashishiyya
had
built
a
of
wood
and
silk
west
of
el
kahira
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramids
over
a
series
of
moonlit
nights
daoud
had
drunk
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
brew
he
had
entered
hell
in
the
bowels
of
the
great
pyramid
and
then
had
ascended
into
paradise
where
the
houris
promised
by
the
prophet
had
ministered
to
him
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
yes
he
knew
very
well
what
delights
sordello
had
experienced
what
are
you
then
sordello
growled
his
eyes
flashing
open
some
kind
of
stregone
what
was
that
witches
potion
you
made
me
drink
do
you
wish
to
return
to
paradise
you
a
devil
maestro
you
want
my
soul
the
man
was
quick
daoud
thought
for
all
that
he
was
a
flawed
man
he
had
a
strong
mind
he
remembered
being
made
to
drink
the
preparation
of
wine
and
hashish
and
he
already
realized
why
daoud
had
done
this
to
him
delicate
this
now
the
bond
must
be
forged
as
a
succession
of
old
men
of
the
mountain
had
forged
it
between
themselves
and
their
disciples
in
alamut
in
masyaf
in
all
those
mountain
strongholds
across
persia
and
syria
from
which
terror
had
gone
forth
for
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
i
am
but
a
man
like
you
sordello
i
do
not
want
your
soul
i
want
your
loyalty
you
want
my
treachery
you
mean
you
want
me
to
betray
my
master
the
count
de
gobignon
there
was
more
than
quickness
here
daoud
thought
there
was
that
foolhardiness
he
had
seen
in
sordello
before
a
man
of
sense
knowing
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
a
force
beyond
his
control
even
beyond
his
understanding
would
do
nothing
to
antagonize
that
force
yet
sordello
persisted
in
challenging
daoud
at
the
mention
of
simon
de
gobignon
name
daoud
concentration
wavered
when
de
gobignon
found
his
knight
dead
outside
mansion
what
would
he
do
there
would
be
trouble
over
this
surely
there
would
be
trouble
daoud
cursed
himself
for
leaving
tilia
house
and
going
back
to
the
cardinal
mansion
he
forced
his
mind
back
to
sordello
how
to
work
with
this
provoking
spirit
to
send
you
into
the
enemy
camp
as
he
did
count
simon
must
have
great
confidence
in
your
ability
sordello
laughed
angrily
confidence
that
high
and
mighty
french
fop
he
was
probably
hoping
you
would
catch
me
sia
maledetto
he
curses
de
gobignon
excellent
or
is
this
merely
for
my
benefit
daoud
peered
at
sordello
wishing
the
room
were
lit
by
more
than
a
few
torches
burning
in
cressets
the
flickering
light
was
impressive
like
this
gilded
throne
but
if
daoud
could
get
closer
to
sordello
and
see
better
he
could
be
more
sure
of
what
the
man
was
really
feeling
daoud
said
he
who
is
loyal
to
me
is
never
cast
out
no
matter
how
foolishly
he
behaves
does
he
who
is
loyal
to
you
get
to
go
to
paradise
often
maestro
sordello
voice
was
thick
with
yearning
it
was
time
for
the
final
step
daoud
beckoned
the
nearest
hooded
figure
on
his
right
who
was
actually
lorenzo
came
forward
with
a
green
earthenware
cup
he
bent
and
held
it
before
the
kneeling
sordello
more
of
your
stregoneria
or
have
you
finally
decided
to
poison
me
would
i
have
showered
you
with
wonders
as
i
have
tonight
only
to
kill
you
no
i
have
one
final
wonder
to
show
you
drink
sordello
wonder
probably
will
be
the
death
of
you
but
not
for
a
after
a
long
hesitation
the
old
bravo
lifted
his
head
and
swallowed
the
liquid
lorenzo
poured
down
his
throat
he
made
a
sour
face
paugh
it
tastes
bad
daoud
said
nothing
and
waited
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
sordello
sat
back
on
his
heels
his
gray
head
began
to
nod
his
eyes
closed
daoud
arose
from
the
throne
and
went
down
to
him
holding
a
candle
in
one
hand
look
at
me
sordello
the
prisoner
head
lifted
and
his
brown
eyes
stared
fixedly
into
daoud
daoud
bent
and
passed
the
candle
flame
before
sordello
face
but
his
eyes
remained
motionless
do
you
love
simon
de
gobignon
or
do
you
hate
him
hate
i
hate
him
sordello
said
in
a
dull
voice
i
have
suffered
much
on
his
account
would
you
kill
him
if
you
had
the
chance
even
in
his
trance
sordello
eyes
seemed
to
glow
and
his
face
flushed
yes
oh
yes
maestro
gladly
that
was
good
the
will
must
already
be
there
then
it
remained
only
to
shape
the
deed
daoud
reached
inside
the
collar
of
his
tunic
and
pulled
out
the
silver
locket
blossoming
reed
had
given
him
it
was
he
had
decided
better
than
a
word
or
combination
of
words
it
was
something
sordello
would
never
see
again
unless
daoud
wished
him
to
see
it
he
dangled
the
locket
by
its
chain
before
sordello
face
letting
it
swing
from
side
to
side
he
held
the
candle
so
its
flame
reflected
from
the
silver
disk
watch
the
locket
sordello
look
closely
at
it
the
design
on
its
face
is
like
no
other
in
the
world

certain
that
you
would
know
it
if
you
saw
it
again
for
a
time
he
let
the
locket
swing
and
sordello
head
turned
from
side
to
side
following
it
do

locket

and

yes
maestro
daoud
went
back
to
the
throne
and
sat
down
he
slipped
the
chain
over
his
head
and
dropped
the
silver
disk
back
inside
his
tunic
sordello
slumped
in
his
kneeling
posture
like
a
figure
of
wax
that
had
been
placed
too
close
to
a
fire
daoud
waited
patiently
and
in
a
few
moments
sordello
raised
his
head
his
eyes
bloodshot
but
alert
will
you
let
me
visit
paradise
again
soon
his
memory
had
gone
back
to
the
moment
before
he
drank
the
drug
not
soon
said
daoud
but
serve
me
well
and
it
will
happen
again
he
could
not
make
sordello
wait
a
year
as
the
hashishiyya
usually
did
with
their
initiates
but
it
must
be
a
wait
of
some
months
or
the
experience
would
lose
its
magic
and
in
months
his
work
in
orvieto
might
be
done
then
again
i
might
still
be
here
ten
years
from
tell
me
what
i
have
to
do
maestro
serve
me
faithfully
and
from
time
to
time
when
it
pleases
me
you
will
visit
paradise
disobey
me
or
betray
me
we
will
know
instantly
if
you
do
and
when
you
least
expect
it
you
will
find
yourself
in
hell
not
the
one
we
created
for
you
last
night
the
real
one
you
do
need
to
threaten
me
said
sordello
with
a
flash
of
his
old
rebelliousness
just
tell
me
what
you
want
simply
go
on
doing
what
you
have
been
doing
you
will
give
the
count
de
gobignon
information
about
us
but
from
now
on
we
will
tell
you
what
to
tell
him
and
you
will
keep
me
informed
about
the
young
count
hardly
any
work
at
all
you
see
sordello
grunted
i
doubt
it
will
be
that
easy
but
as
long
as
you
offer
a
reward
so
great
i
am
your
man
thought
daoud
hoping
that
his
pity
for
this
creature
did
not
show
in
his
face
but
he
must
remember
that
there
were
hidden
places
in
this
man
soul
and
he
had
never
before
tried
to
enslave
a
man
as
the
hashishiyya
did
it
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
had
succeeded
fully
and
so
he
had
made
a
creature
potentially
as
dangerous
to
himself
as
to
anyone
else
the
flesh
on
the
back
of
his
neck
crawled
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
staring
out
at
the
spot
on
the
street
where
the
young
man
body
had
lain
she
heard
the
door
open
behind
her
she
turned
and
there
was
david
lean
tall
with
those
eyes
she
forgot
herself
and
felt
a
leap
of
love
and
then
her
heart
clenched
like
a
fist
with
anger
let
him
tell
it
before
i
judge
he
closed
the
door
slowly
a
strange
expression
on
his
face
she
looked
from
him
to
the
image
of
the
saint
yes
the
look
around
the
eyes
was
the
same
they
had
accepted
pain
and
sorrow
did
not
struggle
against
it
as
ordinary
people
did
and
they
knew
except
that
david
eyes
were
not
the
bright
blue
of
the
saint
david
eyes
seemed
to
reflect
whatever
color
was
about
him
how
could
it
be
that
the
icon
she
had
painted
could
remind
her
of
two
such
different
men
as
simon
de
gobignon
and
david
of
trebizond
he
stood
there
looking
at
her
and
she
realized
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
he
wanted
to
know
what
she
and
simon
had
done
in
this
room
and
he
did
not
want
to
ask
and
she
knew
at
that
instant
watching
his
face
that
he
was
expecting
to
be
hurt
by
what
she
would
tell
him
about
herself
and
simon
what
about
that
young
frenchman
in
the
street
i
saw
simon
kneel
by
him
weep
for
him
bear
him
something
terrible
has
happened
she
said
his
eyes
narrowed
you
did
not
succeed
with
de
gobignon
no
someone
killed
his
friend
who
was
waiting
for
him
down
there
in
the
street
everything
is
ruined
simon
will
not
want
to
see
me
again
he
will
be
certain
to
blame
me
for
that
young
man
death
why
should
he
david
walked
over
to
the
chest
where
the
enameled
candlesticks
on
either
side
of
the
painting
of
the
saint
still
held
stumps
of
candles
he
sat
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
chest
he
rested
his
forearms
on
his
knees
and
his
gaze
on
the
flame
and
azure
carpet
there
were
deep
lines
in
his
face
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
slept
all
last
night
his
face
in
front
of
the
saint
face
looking
from
one
to
the
other
sophia
saw
the
resemblance
more
plainly
than
ever
she
sighed
and
spoke
with
elaborate
patience
what
else
can
simon
think
but
that
his
friend
was
killed
by
some
overzealous
protector
of
mine
why
would
a
protector
kill
a
man
standing
in
the
street
when
there
is
another
man
up
in
the
bedroom
with
the
woman
he
is
supposed
to
protect
there
was
something
in
the
harshness
of
his
gaze
a
flatness
in
his
eyes
that
told
her
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
it
was
he
who
had
killed
simon
young
companion
but
had
he
not
been
at
tilia
house
all
night
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
simon
will
probably
think
that
way
too
from
his
seat
on
the
floor
david
looked
up
at
her
with
a
hard
smile
and
since
i
am
certain
you
gave
him
incomparable
pleasure
in
bed
he
will
overcome
any
objections
he
has
to
seeing
you
again
she
felt
as
if
he
had
stamped
on
her
heart
to
him
she
was
nothing
but
a
harlot
to
be
used
to
ensnare
his
enemies
and
if
that
was
all
thought
she
was
how
could
she
find
it
possible
to
think
any
better
of
herself
i
am
not
a
whore
what
am
i
but
she
would
tell
him
the
truth
whether
or
not
he
chose
to
believe
it
nothing
happened
between
us
she
said
tonelessly
he
stared
at
the
carpet
she
saw
hope
struggling
with
doubt
in
his
face
doubt
won
his
smile
was
cynical
you
failed
to
seduce
him
i
can
not
believe
that
whatever
you
may
believe
that
was
how
it
was
why
do
you
bother
to
lie
to
me
anger
smoldered
in
his
face
his
cheeks
were
reddening
why
i
lie
to
you
it
would
make
no
difference
to
you
if
i
went
to
bed
with
simon
if
as
you
say
nothing
happened
then
explain
to
me
why
it
did
not
he
folded
his
arms
and
sat
hunched
forward
when
a
man
like
simon
is
in
love
she
said
and
stopped
you
understand
what
i
mean
by
love
how
did
a
man
brought
up
in
egypt
as
a
slave
to
turks
feel
about
women
saracens
she
knew
kept
their
many
wives
locked
up
most
of
the
time
daoud
shrugged
i
can
only
guess
at
what
mean
by
love
a
man
like
simon
shows
his
love
by
holding
back
his
ardor
he
does
not
realize
that
i
know
this
i
have
let
him
think
he
is
teaching
me
about
courtly
love
and
what
did
you
learn
by
letting
him
woo
you
in
this
courtly
way
he
looked
pleased
he
was
beginning
to
believe
her
he
tried
to
find
out
things
from
me
he
is
such
an
innocent
he
had
no
idea
that
i
was
telling
him
what
you
told
me
to
tell
him
david
sighed
stood
up
and
walked
to
the
window
she
could
see
the
tension
in
his
back
how
broad
his
shoulders
were
not
huge
like
those
of
some
knights
but
graceful
and
powerful
his
posture
was
not
just
erect
it
was
perfect
straight
yet
flexible
like
a
blade
of
the
finest
steel
she
imagined
him
with
his
shirt
off
the
palms
of
her
hands
tingled
at
the
thought
of
stroking
his
shoulders
did
you
not
want
to
take
him
into
your
bed
his
voice
was
cold
she
thought
back
to
her
night
with
simon
during
those
hours
when
she
had
been
sophia
orfali
she
had
been
disappointed
when
simon
insisted
that
he
would
not
touch
her
but
sophia
orfali
had
to
accept
his
judgment
earlier
she
had
wanted
to
take
simon
to
bed
as
a
kind
of
revenge
on
david
for
letting
rachel
be
used
by
the
tartar
but
last
night
she
had
let
simon
decide
what
they
would
do
when
she
was
with
simon
she
was
what
simon
wanted
her
to
be
that
what
i
am
a
woman
who
becomes
whatever
the
man
she
is
with
wishes
she
expelled
her
breath
in
a
short
sharp
sigh
i
wanted
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
make
love
to
him
i
would
have
done
it
she
shut
her
eyes
momentarily
her
head
spun
now
with
david
here
she
wanted
david
not
simon
and
she
hated
herself
for
wanting
him
when
he
saw
her
as
no
more
than
a
useful
object
as
manfred
had
only
alexis
had
lived
these
loves
i
feel
for
men
for
manfred
for
simon
for
david
i
can
not
help
myself
and
it
betrays
me
it
divides
me
against
myself
and
they
do
not
return
my
and
yet
she
was
sure
david
did
care
for
her
perhaps
even
loved
her
though
he
would
never
admit
it
why
else
this
jealous
questioning
might
even
have
been
why
he
killed
simon
friend
the
thought
made
her
heart
stop
beating
for
an
instant
and
her
body
turn
cold
killing
simon
would
have
upset
david
plans
but
he
might
have
taken
out
his
jealous
rage
on
simon
friend
but
what
did
you
to
do
with
de
gobignon
he
demanded
turning
from
the
window
he
would
not
let
it
alone
she
slid
off
the
bed
and
got
to
her
feet
she
went
to
the
chest
and
stood
with
her
back
to
david
staring
at
the
picture
of
the
saint
anger
clouded
over
her
vision
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
painting
she
clasped
her
hands
together
to
control
their
trembling
i
do
not
have
to
tell
you
that
she
said
in
a
choked
voice
it
does
not
matter
i
do
what
is
necessary
as
i
do
there
was
a
snarl
in
his
voice
what
did
he
mean
by
that
she
wondered
she
turned
and
the
look
she
saw
on
his
face
made
her
stomach
knot
itself
his
teeth
were
bared
and
his
eyes
were
narrowed
to
glowing
slits
now
she
had
to
hear
him
say
it
did
you
kill
that
boy
she
watched
him
slowly
regain
command
of
himself
calm
returned
to
the
hard
tan
features
his
eyes
held
hers
and
their
color
seemed
to
change
from
to
the
cold
gray
of
iron
of
course
she
felt
something
break
inside
her
grief
overwhelmed
her
she
mourned
for
the
young
frenchman
she
did
not
know
the
man
david
had
killed
but
she
imagined
him
to
be
just
like
simon
she
wept
for
him
and
for
simon
and
for
david
she
did
not
want
to
cry
but
she
could
not
help
herself
she
walked
slowly
to
her
bed
and
sat
down
heavily
she
could
feel
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
why
did
you
kill
him
i
had
to
leave
tilia
i
made
the
mistake
of
coming
back
here
from
across
the
street
i
saw
de
gobignon
in
this
window
his
voice
was
tight
his
words
clipped
as
if
he
were
trying
to
hold
something
in
at
the
same
time
the
frank
who
was
on
watch
saw
me
if
i
had
allowed
him
to
live
de
gobignon
would
have
known
that
i
approved
of
his
being
with
you
and
he
was
no
boy
but
a
knight
strong
and
trained
he
could
have
been
no
match
for
you
i
gave
him
no
chance
to
match
himself
against
me
this
is
not
some
tournament
your
life
is
in
as
much
danger
as
mine
is
i
never
forget
that
she
said
david
had
killed
simon
friend
she
wished
that
she
had
gone
to
bed
with
simon
do
you
think
de
gobignon
will
now
be
afraid
to
try
to
see
you
again
there
was
a
sneer
in
david
voice
and
she
felt
the
heated
blood
rising
to
her
face
he
is
no
coward
he
looked
at
her
with
weary
eyes
and
a
tight
little
smile
well
then
he
will
want
to
see
you
again
send
a
message
to
him
have
him
meet
you
someplace
other
than
here
someplace
where
he
will
feel
safe
a
church
perhaps
a
church
yes
that
is
a
good
suggestion
then
you
will
not
have
to
wonder
what
we
are
doing
from
what
i
have
heard
of
christian
churches
that
is
not
necessarily
true
she
wished
she
had
the
skull
to
throw
at
him
again
that
was
all
that
poor
young
knight
would
soon
be
a
skull
buried
in
the
earth
how
dare
you
insult
the
religion
you
were
born
into
she
shouted
have
you
forgotten
that
i
am
a
christian
he
glared
at
her
turned
on
his
heel
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
feeling
alone
unloved
and
desolate
not
even
sure
who
she
was
sophia
sat
heavily
on
her
bed
sobs
racked
her
chest
one
after
the
other
not
willing
to
admit
how
much
daoud
had
hurt
her
she
struggled
with
her
tears
for
a
time
then
gave
in
and
threw
herself
full
length
on
the
bed
pain
spreading
through
her
body
xxxv
is
it
not
a
sin
father
to
explore
a
man
body
like
that
it
is
considered
a
crime
in
many
places
but
it
is
not
a
sin
when
it
is
done
with
reverence
to
discover
the
truth
watching
friar
mathieu
simon
felt
his
stomach
rebel
the
old
priest
bent
over
the
long
naked
form
of
alain
de
pirenne
stretched
out
on
simon
bed
wielding
a
freshly
sharpened
carving
knife
borrowed
from
the
monaldeschi
kitchen
the
knife
flashed
in
the
light
of
the
many
candles
set
around
the
bed
as
friar
mathieu
enlarged
the
wound
in
alain
belly
simon
kept
looking
away
and
then
staring
back
fascinated
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
treat
alain
so
said
simon
though
i
know
you
mean
to
do
good
my
brother
franciscan
friar
roger
of
oxford
says
that
if
you
want
to
know
god
you
must
look
as
closely
as
possible
at
his
works
he
says
that
to
read
the
book
of
god
creation
is
better
than
reading
philosophy
and
is
a
form
of
prayer
philosophy
yes
said
simon
i
learned
last
night
that
fra
tomasso
is
an
enemy
one
moment
friar
mathieu
had
tripled
the
width
of
the
lower
wound
and
was
now
pulling
the
lips
of
the
gash
apart
peering
intently
into
it
if
alain
had
been
alive
simon
knew
blood
would
have
been
pouring
out
of
that
incision
sickened
simon
turned
away
he
wondered
if
he
could
sleep
again
in
this
bed
knowing
that
alain
poor
naked
body
had
been
stretched
out
there
to
be
tormented
in
death
by
this
old
franciscan
if
he
abandoned
the
bed
he
would
have
to
give
up
the
room
though
and
it
was
one
of
the
few
private
rooms
in
the
monaldeschi
palace
it
was
a
warlike
room
as
befitted
a
young
knight
decorated
with
battered
monaldeschi
arms
crossed
halberds
spotted
with
rust
were
hung
on
the
stone
chimney
that
ran
up
from
the
kitchen
on
the
first
floor
shields
dented
and
scratched
each
almost
as
tall
as
a
man
faced
each
other
from
opposite
walls
they
were
probably
quite
old
since
they
bore
simple
blazons
the
one
on
simon
right
was
ocher
with
a
black
chevron
dividing
it
across
the
middle
the
other
bore
an
azure
cross
against
a
white
background
this
being
the
top
floor
of
the
palace
the
mullioned
window
was
spacious
and
friar
mathieu
had
drawn
back
the
curtains
and
pulled
the
twin
window
frames
inward
on
their
hinges
to
get
more
light
simon
went
to
the
window
and
looked
through
the
protective
iron
grill
down
into
the
square
two
men
and
three
horses
were
gathered
by
the
steps
leading
to
the
front
door
they
wore
yellow
and
blue
livery
the
colors
of
the
city
of
orvieto
i
think
i
have
found
something
said
friar
mathieu
just
as
he
finished
speaking
simon
door
shook
under
a
heavy
knock
say
nothing
said
the
franciscan
i
will
tell
you
later
the
knock
sounded
again
simon
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
stocky
man
whose
bald
head
came
up
to
the
middle
of
simon
chest
stood
there
simon
observed
that
the
man
carried
more
muscle
than
fat
on
his
sturdy
frame
he
wore
a
yellow
silk
tunic
trimmed
with
blue
and
a
short
cape
a
bright
gold
medallion
on
a
gold
chain
hung
from
his
neck
two
daggers
one
long
and
stout
the
other
short
and
slender
hung
from
the
right
side
of
his
belt
the
sword
on
his
left
side
reached
from
his
waist
to
his
ankle
simon
knew
he
had
seen
him
before
but
he
could
not
remember
where
your
signory
count
de
gobignon
it
is
my
honor
to
address
you
the
stout
man
said
his
words
were
polite
but
his
tone
was
perfunctory
he
had
to
tilt
his
head
back
to
look
at
simon
but
his
voice
and
expression
made
simon
feel
very
young
and
small
even
so
simon
held
his
silence
and
did
not
step
aside
to
let
the
man
in
let
him
introduce
himself
first
after
a
pause
the
man
said
your
signory
i
am
frescobaldo
podesta
of
orvieto
he
stopped
eyeing
simon
he
had
sparkling
black
eyes
and
his
black
mustache
was
trimmed
so
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
thin
line
above
his
mouth
simon
remembered
now
having
seen
this
man
the
governor
of
the
city
at
the
execution
of
that
poor
heretic
a
month
ago
signore
podesta
simon
bowed
the
honor
is
mine
not
at
all
your
signory
now
the
stout
man
looked
past
simon
into
the
room
and
his
eyebrows
flew
up
simon
turned
and
saw
friar
mathieu
anointing
alain
brow
with
his
thumb
forming
a
cross
on
the
white
forehead
most
of
alain
body
was
under
an
embroidered
coverlet
and
the
kitchen
knife
had
disappeared
blessed
himself
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
examine
the
body
after
the
good
father
is
finished
with
the
last
rites
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
step
out
of
the
room
count
so
that
we
can
talk
closing
the
door
behind
him
simon
followed
through
the
corridor
out
to
the
colonnaded
galleria
overlooking
the
lemon
trees
where
he
and
sophia
had
kissed
on
the
night
of
the
contessa
reception
for
the
tartars
so
long
ago
that
seemed
now
though
it
was
little
more
than
a
month
and
so
much
tragedy
had
come
of
it
simon
told
the
story
he
had
worked
out
that
he
and
alain
had
gone
to
that
inn
searching
for
women
and
had
gotten
separated
there
were
large
bags
under
the
podesta
eyes
dark
as
bruises
they
contracted
as
he
listened
to
simon
forgive
me
your
signory
but
i
must
be
clear
are
you
telling
me
that
you
slept
with
a
woman
last
night
simon
tried
to
look
abashed
and
reluctant
to
speak
yes
and
where
did
this
take
place
your
signory
in
my
private
room
at
the
inn
who
was
she
simon
had
prepared
his
answer
i
do
not
know
a
pleasant
lady
whom
i
met
in
the
common
room
the
bags
under
eyes
twitched
there
are
no
whores
in
that
part
of
town
signore
it
is
one
of
my
duties
to
see
that
the
prostitutes
are
limited
to
a
quarter
of
the
city
where
they
will
not
offend
the
holy
or
the
a
cardinal
has
his
residence
across
the
street
from
where
your
friend
body
was
found
mouth
stretched
but
neither
his
eyes
nor
the
dark
bulges
under
them
joined
in
the
smile
the
woman
who
entertained
you
must
have
been
an
ordinarily
respectable
person
who
chose
to
go
astray
that
evening
he
paused
and
looked
grimly
up
at
simon
simon
felt
as
if
a
clammy
hand
had
taken
him
by
the
back
of
the
neck
he
should
have
realized
this
vaguely
imagined
woman
would
not
satisfy
any
determined
questioner
he
struck
his
fist
against
his
leg
eyes
flickered
and
simon
knew
he
had
caught
the
gesture
he
felt
as
if
a
net
were
slowly
being
drawn
around
him
and
he
resented
it
back
home
no
mere
city
governor
would
dare
trouble
the
count
de
gobignon
any
more
than
he
would
disturb
the
king
or
one
of
his
brothers
as
continued
to
stare
silently
at
him
simon
studied
the
podesta
this
was
a
man
who
was
jealous
of
his
power
simon
decided
a
man
who
despite
his
politeness
would
enjoy
embarrassing
a
young
nobleman
what
was
the
woman
name
pressed
him
i
have
no
idea
the
thick
black
eyebrows
rose
again
wrinkling
the
balding
scalp
you
spent
the
entire
night
with
this
woman
and
never
called
her
by
name
simon
had
been
intending
to
claim
that
honor
forbade
him
to
tell
the
woman
name
he
felt
certain
the
governor
would
reject
that
argument
as
trivial
under
the
circumstances
we
spoke
very
little
i
addressed
her
with
various
foolish
endearments
could
you
describe
her
most
of
the
time
we
were
in
the
dark
simon
felt
had
pressed
him
enough
it
was
time
to
fight
back
signore
podesta
my
good
friend
and
vassal
was
murdered
in
the
street
a
street
supposedly
under
the
protection
of
your
watch
i
fail
to
see
how
it
helps
you
to
do
your
duty
of
finding
his
killer
by
questioning
me
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
the
podesta
brows
drew
together
and
he
took
a
few
steps
backward
diminishing
the
importance
of
the
difference
in
height
between
him
and
simon
your
signory
i
have
questioned
everyone
who
lives
in
that
neighborhood
and
everyone
i
could
find
who
was
passing
through
it
last
night
he
said
i
learned
from
the
innkeeper
at
the
vesuvio
that
your
friend
slept
alone
last
night
i
know
that
you
did
not
meet
anyone
in
the
inn
woman
or
man
you
stopped
there
briefly
left
your
friend
and
went
somewhere
else
you
did
not
engage
a
private
room
for
yourself
the
innkeeper
and
several
other
people
agree
to
that
will
your
signory
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
where
you
did
go
simon
heard
with
dismay
the
weakness
in
his
tone
and
was
appalled
at
how
easily
had
exposed
his
lies
those
you
spoke
to
about
what
i
did
must
have
been
mistaken
he
said
perhaps
they
did
not
notice
my
return
to
the
inn
an
inspiration
struck
him
they
may
be
trying
to
protect
the
woman
i
was
with
smiled
thinly
i
see
then
you
are
telling
me
that
you
had
carnal
relations
with
this
woman
while
your
good
friend
and
vassal
looked
on
simon
was
momentarily
at
a
loss
for
words
it
would
have
delighted
him
to
reply
by
running
through
they
stood
bristling
at
each
other
like
two
hostile
hounds
when
simon
heard
a
door
open
a
moment
later
to
his
enormous
relief
friar
mathieu
joined
them
by
the
marble
railing
overlooking
the
atrium
if
you
wish
to
examine
young
sire
de
pirenne
body
he
lies
in
count
simon
room
waiting
for
you
signore
said
friar
mathieu
this
is
a
very
sad
day
for
us
with
a
black
look
at
simon
bowed
to
the
old
priest
and
left
the
galleria
when
they
were
alone
friar
mathieu
grunted
a
good
thing
i
merely
extended
the
wounds
sire
alain
had
already
suffered
the
podesta
might
well
bring
charges
against
me
for
desecrating
a
corpse
if
he
saw
i
had
made
incisions
in
the
body
did
you
learn
anything
simon
asked
i
am
convinced
that
sire
alain
was
not
merely
stabbed
to
death
what
do
you
mean
simon
was
eager
to
get
friar
mathieu
advice
on
how
to
handle
the
podesta
but
this
was
more
important
when
i
looked
closely
at
the
wound
in
his
stomach
i
discovered
that
it
was
two
wounds
said
friar
mathieu
he
was
punctured
there
by
a
thin
round
object
like
a
large
needle
then
he
was
stabbed
through
the
heart
and
blood
poured
out
of
him
and
then
the
killer
stabbed
him
in
the
belly
to
try
to
mask
the
dart
wound
how
do
you
know
that
the
belly
wound
did
not
bleed
much
so
the
heart
wound
must
have
preceded
it
when
the
killer
drove
his
knife
into
the
puncture
in
the
belly
it
did
not
go
in
exactly
the
same
direction
the
smaller
wound
goes
upward
at
a
slight
angle
as
if
the
needle
were
driven
in
from
the
level
of
the
killer
waist
the
knife
wound
goes
straight
in
i
had
to
dig
below
the
skin
and
ribs
to
discover
the
needle
wound
a
needle
could
not
have
killed
alain
it
could
have
been
a
poisoned
dart
alain
lips
are
blue
that
is
sometimes
a
sign
of
poison
simon
heard
a
clumping
of
boots
in
the
corridor
he
hurried
in
from
the
galleria
to
find
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
accompanied
by
two
priests
striding
toward
the
room
where
alain
lay
now
one
of
your
knights
has
been
killed
de
verceuil
boomed
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
cerise
tunic
with
particolored
hose
and
boots
with
pointed
toes
the
only
indications
of
his
ecclesiastical
office
were
the
absence
of
a
sword
and
the
presence
of
the
large
jeweled
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
a
purple
velvet
cap
adorned
with
a
black
feather
was
draped
over
his
glossy
black
hair
simon
told
the
cardinal
he
and
alain
had
been
out
late
and
had
decided
to
stay
at
an
inn
rather
than
cross
town
during
the
dangerous
night
hours
friar
mathieu
came
and
stood
beside
him
greeting
the
two
priests
who
had
accompanied
de
verceuil
they
loftily
eyed
the
old
brown
robe
and
responded
with
curt
nods
when
simon
finished
his
recital
de
verceuil
leaned
forward
his
small
lower
lip
outthrust
if
you
can
not
protect
your
own
knights
how
can
you
protect
the
emissaries
from
tartary
that
was
not
a
question
but
an
assault
simon
decided
and
required
no
answer
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
find
his
killer
your
eminence
by
god
footprints
i
wish
this
were
my
bishopric
de
verceuil
exclaimed
i
would
take
a
dozen
men
from
that
neighborhood
and
i
would
hang
one
man
a
day
until
the
killer
was
found
i
would
have
the
man
the
door
to
the
room
where
alain
lay
swung
open
and
the
stout
podesta
emerged
he
stood
silently
glowering
up
at
de
verceuil
simon
wondered
whether
had
learned
anything
from
looking
at
poor
corpse
and
what
your
eminence
if
the
people
of
that
neighborhood
truly
do
not
know
who
killed
the
sire
de
pirenne
said
friar
mathieu
until
that
moment
simon
had
assumed
alain
had
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of
some
orvietan
cutthroat
if
not
such
a
one
then
who
he
remembered
giancarlo
and
the
bravos
he
had
met
on
the
road
alain
money
had
been
taken
but
not
his
weapons
and
giancarlo
served
david
of
trebizond
and
david
served
ugolini
was
this
ugolini
way
of
protecting
his
honor
if
giancarlo
had
anything
to
do
with
it
sordello
ought
to
be
able
to
find
out
if
we
arrested
all
the
men
who
live
on
the
street
where
he
was
killed
said
de
verceuil
more
than
likely
among
them
would
be
the
man
who
did
it
these
italians
shopkeepers
by
day
and
robbers
by
night
the
faces
of
the
two
priests
with
him
tightened
simon
glanced
at
and
saw
a
flush
darkening
his
brown
cheeks
the
people
of
that
street
are
among
the
most
respectable
in
orvieto
signore
the
podesta
growled
how
delightful
simon
thought
if
the
odious
de
verceuil
and
the
odious
were
to
tear
into
each
other
de
verceuil
stared
at
the
podesta
in
amazement
and
wrath
while
the
two
priests
turned
their
heads
from
one
to
the
other
in
embarrassment
after
a
moment
one
priest
murmured
de
verceuil
identity
to
while
the
other
softly
told
the
cardinal
who
the
podesta
was
forgive
me
your
eminence
if
my
tone
was
less
respectful
than
you
deserve
said
bowing
to
kiss
de
verceuil
haughtily
extended
sapphire
ring
i
have
encountered
nothing
but
disrespect
from
orvietans
since
i
came
here
said
the
cardinal
and
simon
remembered
that
vile
smear
of
dung
on
his
cheek
the
day
they
arrived
i
had
actually
thought
orvieto
had
no
governor
forgive
me
again
that
i
did
not
pay
my
respects
to
you
before
said
he
did
not
rise
to
the
bait
simon
noticed
an
intelligent
man
a
french
knight
has
been
murdered
in
your
city
podesta
de
verceuil
said
regardless
of
your
high
opinion
of
the
people
of
the
quarter
where
it
happened
i
expect
you
to
press
them
hard
until
you
find
the
killer
a
thing
like
this
can
not
happen
without
someone
seeing
something
or
hearing
something
that
reminded
simon
that
no
one
had
come
forward
to
claim
the
reward
he
had
offered
if
someone
had
heard
or
seen
something
that
person
was
doubtless
too
frightened
to
speak
of
it
your
eminence
gives
me
most
valuable
advice
said
i
promise
you
we
shall
not
rest
until
the
killer
is
found
his
round
body
bobbed
forward
in
a
bow
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
sword
and
daggers
swinging
and
marched
away
pompous
little
man
said
de
verceuil
and
doubtless
incompetent
and
treacherous
the
cardinal
turned
to
simon
now
do
not
leave
it
to
that
watch
commander
to
find
the
killer
the
knight
what
was
his
name
simon
told
him
de
pirenne
was
your
man
and
you
are
responsible
for
his
death
put
all
the
men
under
you
to
work
hunting
down
the
murderer
do
whatever
has
to
be
done
we
must
not
let
the
death
of
a
french
knight
go
unavenged
as
your
eminence
wills
so
i
will
said
simon
de
verceuil
raised
a
finger
and
we
will
have
a
splendid
funeral
the
pope
himself
will
be
present
let
the
grandeur
of
the
ceremony
show
that
we
french
do
not
take
the
death
of
one
of
our
number
lightly
let
these
sneaking
italians
tremble
before
our
wrath
again
the
two
priests
looked
at
each
other
and
one
of
them
shrugged
resignedly
barbarians
we
must
seem
to
simon
face
grew
hot
with
embarrassment
xxxvi
canaglia
give
way
or
i
will
have
your
heart
on
a
platter
hearing
the
shout
simon
stifled
a
curse
and
turned
to
see
arms
waving
a
man
in
helmet
and
leather
chest
armor
fall
back
pushed
by
another
the
man
shouting
and
pushing
was
peppino
one
of
simon
venetian
crossbowmen
the
man
peppino
had
knocked
down
was
grigor
one
of
the
tartars
bodyguards
dear
god
not
today
sunk
in
grief
though
he
was
he
would
have
to
do
something
for
alain
that
today
of
all
days
the
day
of
alain
funeral
might
not
be
marred
by
brawling
from
his
seat
atop
a
stallion
in
the
gateway
of
the
monaldeschi
courtyard
he
looked
down
on
a
boiling
mass
of
bright
conical
helmets
all
of
them
now
moving
toward
the
action
in
the
center
of
the
yard
he
kicked
his
horse
flanks
and
drove
into
the
crowd
he
had
to
break
up
the
fight
before
it
started
the
armenian
was
on
his
feet
and
reaching
for
his
dagger
and
peppino
had
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
own
blade
before
simon
could
reach
them
teodoro
whom
simon
had
appointed
capitano
of
the
crossbowmen
after
dismissing
sordello
forced
his
way
between
the
two
men
he
turned
his
back
on
the
armenian
and
gave
peppino
a
violent
shove
with
both
hands
stupido
back
in
line
what
devil
work
is
this
simon
demanded
teodoro
turned
and
saluted
simon
smartly
your
signory
peppino
is
a
fool
but
the
armenians
provoked
him
they
insist
on
marching
before
us
in
the
cortege
are
we
not
to
march
behind
the
french
knights
idiots
what
difference
did
it
make
they
had
forgotten
that
this
parade
was
for
alain
they
thought
it
was
for
them
he
felt
a
dull
hatred
for
both
the
venetians
and
the
armenians
simon
sent
for
ana
the
multilingual
bulgarian
woman
who
translated
for
the
armenians
simon
explanation
that
the
french
knights
must
ride
as
an
honor
guard
directly
behind
alain
bier
and
that
since
the
venetians
were
directly
under
the
command
of
the
french
they
must
come
next
also
no
one
must
come
between
the
tartar
ambassadors
and
their
armenian
bodyguards
therefore
the
venetians
must
precede
the
armenians
sergentes
get
your
men
back
into
line
simon
shouted
at
the
leaders
of
the
hundred
monaldeschi
milling
about
in
the
courtyard
along
with
the
venetians
and
the
armenians
simon
spurred
his
horse
back
to
the
head
of
the
procession
where
he
took
his
position
just
behind
alain
bier
which
was
already
in
the
street
the
sire
de
pirenne
lay
upon
a
huge
square
of
red
samite
edged
with
gold
draped
over
the
flat
bed
of
a
cart
red
ribbons
were
woven
into
the
spokes
of
the
wheels
the
two
farm
horses
that
drew
the
cart
chosen
for
their
docility
also
wore
red
surcoats
red
for
martyrdom
red
for
the
blood
poor
alain
had
shed
simon
sighed
inwardly
and
hoped
that
god
considered
alain
a
martyr
and
had
taken
him
up
to
heaven
had
he
not
died
while
in
the
service
of
the
church
was
this
not
a
crusade
in
all
but
name
alain
was
dressed
in
a
white
linen
surcoat
and
a
white
silk
mantle
simon
henri
de
puys
and
the
other
four
knights
had
dressed
him
themselves
what
agony
the
struggle
to
get
poor
dead
alain
big
frame
into
his
garments
had
taken
nearly
an
hour
thank
heaven
de
puys
had
stopped
simon
from
trying
to
dress
alain
in
his
mail
shirt
and
hose
as
simon
had
originally
intended
de
puys
pointed
out
that
alain
family
were
poor
and
that
alain
younger
brother
would
have
need
of
the
expensive
armor
so
the
armor
would
be
sent
back
to
the
gobignon
domain
along
with
the
news
that
alain
was
dead
oh
the
woe
alain
widowed
mother
and
younger
brother
would
feel
when
simon
letter
reached
them
friar
mathieu
had
helped
him
compose
the
impossible
lines
but
simon
still
felt
they
were
not
gentle
enough
not
comforting
enough
he
hated
himself
for
feeling
relieved
that
family
was
too
far
away
for
him
to
deliver
the
news
in
person
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
sending
the
letter
and
alain
armor
to
his
chaplain
at
château
gobignon
with
instructions
to
take
it
personally
to
the
de
pirennes
and
read
it
to
them
offering
them
all
possible
consolation
they
being
almost
certainly
unlettered
around
alain
waist
was
clasped
his
jeweled
belt
of
knighthood
and
to
his
leather
boots
were
fastened
his
knight
silver
spurs
his
hands
resting
on
his
chest
grasped
the
hilt
of
his
naked
longsword
simon
would
buy
another
sword
for
his
brother
his
helmet
polished
to
mirror
brightness
by
his
sobbing
equerry
rested
beside
his
blond
head
his
shield
square
at
the
top
and
pointed
at
the
bottom
blazoned
with
five
black
eaglets
on
a
gold
ground
lay
crosswise
at
his
feet
those
things
alain
must
take
to
his
final
rest
simon
stomach
was
a
hollow
of
anguish
those
splendid
arms
and
alain
had
never
had
a
chance
to
use
any
of
them
a
breeze
stirred
the
curly
yellow
locks
of
the
pale
head
that
lay
on
a
red
silk
pillow
the
air
of
orvieto
had
grown
chilly
in
the
three
days
since
alain
murder
the
city
had
enjoyed
almost
summer
weather
until
late
in
the
fall
but
now
november
had
fallen
upon
it
with
icy
talons
the
sky
this
morning
was
a
heavy
and
a
dampness
in
the
air
foretold
chill
rain
at
the
very
head
of
the
procession
walked
henri
de
puys
bareheaded
but
in
full
armor
leading
alain
riderless
great
horse
the
cart
bearing
the
body
driven
by
a
servant
in
orange
and
green
monaldeschi
livery
followed
then
came
simon
and
the
other
french
knights
god
let
nothing
else
unseemly
happen
today
let
us
bury
your
servant
the
sire
alain
de
pirenne
with
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
two
tartars
wearing
their
cylindrical
caps
adorned
with
red
stones
and
their
red
and
blue
silk
jackets
had
mounted
their
horses
because
alain
was
a
warrior
and
they
were
warriors
they
rode
horses
to
honor
him
today
the
sight
of
them
was
a
reproach
to
simon
if
he
had
thought
only
of
the
tartars
and
not
become
involved
with
sophia
alain
would
be
alive
today
after
the
tartars
rows
of
spear
points
and
helmets
glittered
the
monaldeschi
retainers
and
behind
the
monaldeschi
banner
two
green
chevrons
on
an
orange
background
rose
a
curtained
sedan
chair
draped
with
black
mourning
streamers
in
it
simon
knew
were
the
contessa
and
her
grandnephew
simon
had
been
waiting
for
the
contessa
to
appear
he
raised
his
arm
in
a
signal
to
de
puys
who
began
to
walk
southward
toward
the
corso
pulling
the
reins
of
alain
horse
the
wheels
of
the
cart
creaked
into
motion
as
the
procession
wound
its
way
through
the
larger
streets
of
orvieto
the
thought
occurred
to
simon
that
alain
killer
might
be
among
the
onlookers
one
of
the
faces
that
watched
with
little
emotion
from
the
sidelines
or
looked
out
of
a
window
sordello
had
sent
word
through
ana
that
among
giancarlo
hired
bravos
none
had
any
idea
who
might
have
stabbed
alain
simon
knew
what
the
orvietans
most
of
them
must
be
saying
french
knight
goes
whoring
and
gets
himself
stabbed
and
they
give
him
the
greatest
funeral
since
julius
a
stab
of
guilt
shot
through
him
to
protect
sophia
he
had
told
de
verceuil
and
that
he
and
alain
had
gone
wenching
he
had
besmirched
alain
reputation
the
cortege
stopped
at
every
church
in
orvieto
and
before
each
body
was
blessed
by
two
or
three
cardinals
who
then
with
their
entourages
joined
the
long
line
of
mourners
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
simon
could
no
longer
see
the
end
of
the
procession
it
disappeared
around
a
distant
turning
in
the
street
not
all
orvietans
were
without
feeling
many
girls
and
young
women
wept
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
threw
flowers
from
balconies
to
the
handsome
frenchman
murdered
in
his
prime
alain
would
have
welcomed
more
attention
from
them
when
he
was
alive
simon
thought
bitterly
at
the
convent
of
the
dominicans
a
collection
of
brown
stone
buildings
behind
a
high
wall
the
rotund
fra
tomasso
emerged
followed
by
two
dozen
or
more
of
his
dominican
brothers
all
in
white
wool
tunics
with
black
mantles
three
of
the
leading
members
of
the
preaching
friars
the
superior
general
the
father
visitor
for
northern
italy
and
the
prior
of
the
convent
blessed
the
body
fra
tomasso
was
to
deliver
the
funeral
sermon
a
great
honor
for
alain
it
must
be
downright
painful
for
the
fat
friar
to
walk
from
his
convent
to
the
cathedral
that
was
an
honor
in
itself
but
the
sight
of
fra
tomasso
made
simon
cold
with
anxiety
remembering
how
sophia
had
told
him
that
the
stout
dominican
had
turned
against
the
tartars
the
one
thing
that
might
even
if
only
in
a
small
way
make
up
for
the
infinite
tragedy
of
alain
death
was
that
important
piece
of
information
sophia
had
unwittingly
given
simon
and
when
simon
had
told
it
to
friar
mathieu
the
old
franciscan
feeling
he
had
no
choice
had
taken
the
news
to
de
verceuil
simon
hated
to
see
him
do
that
but
he
had
to
agree
that
de
verceuil
was
the
only
one
in
their
party
whose
position
was
exalted
enough
to
permit
him
to
make
demands
on
fra
tomasso
de
verceuil
had
paid
a
call
on
the
superior
general
of
the
dominicans
but
what
went
on
behind
the
walls
of
the
preaching
friars
convent
simon
and
friar
mathieu
had
never
learned
in
his
usual
infuriating
way
de
verceuil
had
refused
to
talk
about
it
at
the
gateway
to
his
palace
pope
urban
all
in
gold
and
white
met
the
procession
as
simon
dismounted
and
knelt
on
the
stone
street
to
receive
the
pope
blessing
he
noted
that
the
old
man
face
was
as
pale
as
his
vestments
and
that
his
hands
were
trembling
had
alain
murder
affected
him
so
or
was
he
ill
urban
was
flanked
by
six
cardinals
in
red
hats
and
brilliant
red
robes
on
his
right
were
three
french
cardinals
including
de
verceuil
beside
him
was
guy
le
gros
whom
simon
had
met
at
the
pope
council
le
gros
looked
angry
simon
hoped
he
was
angry
about
alain
murder
every
frenchman
in
orvieto
should
be
but
what
a
shame
that
alain
had
to
die
in
order
that
all
these
people
care
about
him
on
urban
left
were
three
italians
the
diminutive
ugolini
standing
right
beside
the
pope
the
sight
of
him
was
a
blow
to
simon
heart
simon
had
been
in
his
mansion
wooing
sophia
when
alain
was
murdered
alain
bleeding
body
had
lain
across
the
street
from
ugolini
mansion
for
how
many
hours
and
where
was
sophia
anxiously
simon
scanned
the
crowd
for
a
sight
of
her
would
she
not
come
had
alain
death
frightened
her
would
he
ever
see
her
again
he
despised
himself
for
still
wanting
to
see
sophia
when
his
tryst
with
her
had
caused
alain
death
he
should
give
her
up
can
not
give
her
after
the
blessing
pope
urban
took
his
place
with
his
escort
of
cardinals
at
the
head
of
the
procession
they
moved
to
the
piazza
before
the
cathedral
as
packed
with
people
as
it
had
been
the
day
the
heretic
was
executed
there
death
death
here
they
were
again
to
celebrate
death
when
alain
body
reached
the
cathedral
pope
urban
blessed
it
once
more
simon
and
the
other
french
knights
raised
a
pallet
that
was
hidden
under
the
red
samite
cloth
and
carried
alain
into
the
cathedral
the
cathedral
was
a
festival
of
light
and
the
sight
of
it
made
simon
feel
a
little
better
simon
and
de
verceuil
had
agreed
to
share
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
which
included
the
rows
of
candles
lighting
the
altar
all
of
the
purest
beeswax
and
the
double
line
of
fat
candles
in
tall
brass
sticks
running
down
the
middle
of
the
church
benches
had
been
cleared
from
the
nave
of
the
cathedral
to
make
room
for
the
funeral
procession
the
shadows
where
the
massed
candle
flames
did
not
reach
were
illuminated
by
a
dim
underwater
glow
faint
because
the
sky
was
overcast
that
seeped
in
through
the
narrow
stained
glass
windows
touching
a
mourner
here
or
there
with
a
spot
of
red
light
or
blue
or
green
the
french
knights
carried
alain
to
the
front
of
the
cathedral
and
set
his
body
down
on
a
platform
simon
took
a
position
to
the
right
of
the
body
from
here
he
could
see
rows
of
cardinals
and
bishops
on
either
side
of
him
the
cardinals
in
their
red
hats
sat
in
the
first
row
and
simon
recognized
de
verceuil
by
his
height
and
by
the
shining
waves
of
black
hair
that
tumbled
from
under
the
wide
brim
of
his
tasseled
hat
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
walked
slowly
up
the
aisle
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
plump
grandnephew
as
she
neared
the
altar
cardinal
ugolini
suddenly
broke
away
from
his
position
beside
pope
urban
and
bustled
down
to
take
her
other
arm
with
these
two
escorts
both
the
same
height
the
contessa
tottered
to
a
cushioned
seat
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
ugolini
stroked
her
hand
whispered
to
her
kissed
her
cheek
and
went
back
up
the
altar
steps
to
stand
beside
the
pope
wish
he
were
not
so
friendly
with
the
contessa
it
is
a
danger
to
the
it
occurred
to
simon
suddenly
that
alain
death
would
go
for
nothing
if
the
pact
between
tartars
and
christians
were
not
sealed
now
simon
had
another
reason
beside
the
restoration
of
his
family
honor
beside
his
love
for
king
louis
to
strive
for
the
alliance
on
the
side
of
the
altar
opposite
the
contessa
also
in
a
armchair
sat
a
dark
young
man
about
simon
age
in
a
surcoat
of
blue
velvet
with
a
heavy
gold
chain
around
his
neck
he
sat
very
erect
and
his
dark
eyes
burned
with
hatred
as
he
stared
across
the
altar
at
the
contessa
and
her
grandnephew
he
had
been
pointed
out
before
to
simon
as
marco
di
filippeschi
capo
della
famiglia
of
the
archenemies
the
contessa
herself
had
suggested
that
a
filippeschi
might
have
murdered
alain
just
because
he
was
a
guest
of
the
monaldeschi
family
simon
supposed
the
filippeschi
chieftain
was
paying
public
respect
to
alain
to
demonstrate
his
family
innocence
the
filippeschi
simon
had
heard
were
opposed
to
a
french
presence
in
italy
perhaps
simply
because
the
monaldeschi
were
friendly
to
the
french
so
opposed
that
they
would
murder
an
innocent
young
man
simon
burned
to
seize
marco
di
filippeschi
and
throttle
the
truth
from
him
by
turning
his
head
slightly
simon
could
see
friar
mathieu
on
the
left
side
of
the
church
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
franciscan
congregation
beyond
the
franciscans
in
the
shadow
of
a
pillar
stood
a
stout
man
in
dark
cape
and
tunic
the
podesta
observing
the
funeral
thinking
perhaps
that
alain
killer
might
attend
he
prayed
that
the
podesta
would
stop
wasting
his
time
pursuing
the
nonexistent
women
simon
and
alain
had
been
with
alain
killer
damn
you
simon
thought
clenching
his
teeth
simon
turned
briefly
to
survey
the
crowd
that
filled
the
nave
all
the
way
to
the
doors
halfway
back
a
spot
of
red
light
from
a
window
fell
on
a
man
blond
hair
simon
was
almost
certain
that
was
david
of
trebizond
he
still
saw
no
sign
of
sophia
and
his
heart
fell
as
simon
watched
the
pope
celebrate
the
mass
assisted
by
the
two
cardinals
the
italian
ugolini
and
the
french
le
gros
he
wondered
whether
alain
was
watching
from
heaven
he
must
be
in
heaven
was
he
not
a
martyr
but
did
alain
care
about
what
was
happening
on
this
earth
surely
a
man
would
want
to
see
his
own
funeral
for
a
moment
simon
imagined
he
could
speak
to
alain
reach
out
and
touch
him
do
you
like
this
my
friend
the
pope
himself
says
mass
for
simon
choked
on
a
sob
and
had
to
wipe
tears
from
his
face
the
pope
sang
the
gospel
in
a
quavering
voice
and
a
chorus
of
stout
young
priests
boomed
back
the
responses
the
voices
rising
and
falling
in
the
chant
devised
by
pope
gregory
the
great
unaccompanied
by
any
instrument
rebounded
from
the
heavy
stones
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
simon
swore
to
himself
he
would
write
about
this
to
alain
mother
when
it
came
time
for
the
sermon
fra
tomasso
rose
from
the
bench
that
had
been
set
for
him
at
the
front
of
the
cathedral
he
turned
and
bowed
to
the
pope
who
sat
in
a
throne
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
pope
urban
hand
twitched
in
a
small
gesture
of
blessing
standing
at
the
head
of
alain
bier
simon
was
close
enough
to
fra
tomasso
to
hear
the
breath
whistling
through
his
nostrils
as
he
exerted
himself
to
move
his
bulk
from
bench
to
altar
steps
the
black
rosary
around
his
middle
rattled
with
his
steps
and
creaked
with
his
heavy
breathing
a
hush
heavy
with
the
odor
of
incense
fell
over
the
crowd
assembled
in
the
nave
for
a
sermon
by
a
bishop
or
even
a
cardinal
this
crowd
of
prelates
would
probably
go
on
whispering
to
each
other
but
all
were
interested
in
hearing
the
who
was
famous
throughout
christendom
whom
some
revered
as
a
living
saint
and
a
few
others
considered
a
subtle
heretic
fra
tomasso
spoke
latin
as
was
customary
before
any
assemblage
of
churchmen
his
tenor
voice
sent
reverberations
through
the
nave
of
the
great
church
it
is
a
sad
moment
he
said
when
god
chooses
to
cut
off
a
young
man
in
his
prime
yet
it
happens
all
too
often
i
share
the
sorrow
of
the
family
and
friends
of
this
excellent
young
knight
he
said
and
simon
felt
comforted
indeed
all
christendom
must
mourn
the
loss
of
such
a
fine
young
man
killed
while
performing
his
duty
far
from
home
guarding
an
embassy
to
his
holiness
from
the
other
side
of
the
earth
accompanying
a
friend
making
a
secret
visit
to
a
the
stout
friar
waxed
philosophic
as
was
expected
of
him
discoursing
on
the
fifth
commandment
thou
shalt
not
kill
using
alain
as
an
example
the
sire
de
pirenne
death
was
murder
ambush
out
of
the
dark
he
said
loud
coughing
interrupted
the
sermon
simon
looked
and
saw
that
it
was
pope
urban
bent
double
cardinal
le
gros
holding
his
arm
and
resting
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
while
cardinal
ugolini
looked
alarmed
the
coughing
had
a
burbling
sound
to
it
as
if
the
old
pope
lungs
were
full
of
fluid
a
cough
like
that
in
november
was
an
ominous
thing
thought
simon
fra
tomasso
resumed
when
his
holiness
had
quieted
to
kill
is
not
always
a
sin
he
said
but
to
kill
the
innocent
is
it
is
not
a
sin
therefore
to
wage
war
on
the
saracens
as
pope
after
pope
has
called
upon
good
christian
warriors
to
do
because
the
saracens
are
not
innocent
they
hold
in
their
clutches
the
most
sacred
places
of
christendom
the
lands
where
our
lord
jesus
christ
was
born
and
died
they
rob
and
murder
pilgrims
seeking
to
visit
those
holy
places
and
they
seek
to
spread
the
false
religion
of
mohammedanism
which
denies
the
central
mystery
of
our
faith
christ
crucified
dead
and
risen
again
for
all
these
reasons
the
saracens
should
be
fought
fra
tomasso
paused
and
looked
about
him
simon
felt
that
the
pause
was
intended
to
be
significant
that
the
great
dominican
was
about
to
say
something
very
important
but
the
silence
was
disturbed
by
a
whispering
it
came
from
behind
simon
and
to
his
right
he
glanced
in
that
direction
and
saw
that
the
bulgarian
woman
ana
was
sitting
with
the
two
tartars
and
was
whispering
her
translation
of
fra
tomasso
sermon
to
john
the
older
one
who
was
immediately
on
her
left
we
may
ask
ourselves
why
does
god
permit
an
innocent
young
man
like
this
to
die
fra
tomasso
went
on
the
answer
is
of
course
that
he
permits
it
to
make
possible
a
greater
good
the
exercise
of
human
free
will
i
say
to
you
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
crucified
at
the
age
of
is
the
type
of
all
innocent
young
men
done
to
death
by
evil
and
evil
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
human
freedom
fra
tomasso
looked
out
over
his
audience
for
another
silent
moment
then
said
god
must
value
freedom
very
highly
if
he
allows
so
much
evil
to
occur
just
so
freedom
can
exist
never
thought
of
but
there
was
very
little
freedom
in
the
world
simon
thought
apart
from
the
power
to
sin
everybody
from
kings
down
to
the
meanest
serfs
was
bound
in
a
net
of
obligations
duties
laws
loyalties
obedience
simon
remembered
what
friar
mathieu
had
said
about
using
fra
vow
of
obedience
through
de
verceuil
speaking
to
his
dominican
superior
to
force
him
to
give
up
his
opposition
to
the
alliance
and
now
simon
noticed
that
fra
tomasso
was
looking
at
de
verceuil
often
all
too
often
one
man
will
seek
to
rob
another
of
the
freedom
to
do
what
is
right
fra
tomasso
said
if
a
superior
commands
another
to
do
wrong
and
the
inferior
obeys
the
one
who
gives
the
wrongful
order
bears
the
greater
burden
of
guilt
but
some
guilt
also
falls
upon
the
one
who
obeys
it
is
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
and
after
the
greatest
deliberation
that
one
should
disobey
any
order
from
one
of
higher
rank
but
there
are
times
when
it
must
be
done
again
he
looked
at
de
verceuil
thus
when
we
see
a
mighty
nation
that
again
and
again
does
harm
to
the
innocent
said
fra
tomasso
we
are
bound
in
conscience
to
denounce
it
simon
felt
as
if
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
with
a
rock
now
he
was
sure
of
what
was
coming
and
so
evidently
were
others
because
a
murmuring
was
arising
in
the
church
fra
tomasso
blinked
slowly
as
if
to
show
his
calm
acceptance
of
the
stir
he
was
causing
we
are
obliged
to
denounce
unjust
war
even
when
the
evildoer
offers
us
the
hand
of
fellowship
when
a
puissant
nation
takes
up
arms
against
the
world
when
it
makes
war
its
chief
occupation
when
it
attacks
peoples
that
have
not
harmed
it
when
it
threatens
all
humanity
we
are
not
permitted
to
condone
such
wrongs
when
this
nation
carries
war
to
innocent
unarmed
men
women
and
children
slaughtering
these
noncombatants
by
the
tens
and
hundreds
of
thousands
we
are
obliged
to
condemn
it
my
god
if
this
is
the
church
verdict
all
is
simon
looked
at
the
pope
on
his
throne
to
the
right
of
the
altar
he
sat
slumped
his
white
mitre
tilted
forward
his
eyes
half
shut
as
if
in
thought
simon
saw
no
sign
that
urban
objected
to
what
fra
tomasso
was
saying
the
murmur
was
louder
now
despairing
simon
turned
to
look
back
at
the
tartars
little
points
of
candlelight
were
reflected
in
their
black
eyes
and
their
brown
faces
were
tight
simon
could
imagine
what
would
happen
to
anyone
holy
man
or
not
who
spoke
out
against
them
so
in
their
own
camp
the
stout
dominican
stretched
an
arm
in
a
flowing
white
sleeve
toward
the
still
body
on
the
red
bier
it
may
be
asked
why
do
i
speak
of
such
things
on
this
sad
day
when
we
mourn
a
young
man
cruelly
struck
down
in
youth
i
answer
that
this
young
man
came
here
and
died
here
because
christendom
is
now
faced
with
this
great
moral
dilemma
what
we
owe
this
young
man
what
we
owe
any
man
who
dies
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
is
to
do
our
own
duty
enough
sit
down
came
a
hoarse
whisper
from
simon
left
and
he
turned
to
see
de
verceuil
half
out
of
his
chair
fists
clenched
it
had
been
de
verceuil
who
had
wanted
fra
tomasso
as
the
most
distinguished
speaker
in
orvieto
to
deliver
the
funeral
sermon
and
doubtless
it
was
the
cardinal
dealing
with
fra
tomasso
that
had
provoked
this
particular
sermon
and
now
de
verceuil
was
trying
publicly
to
silence
fra
tomasso
making
more
enemies
for
their
cause
fra
tomasso
turned
in
the
cardinal
direction
then
once
again
slowly
shut
his
eyes
and
slowly
opened
them
as
he
turned
away
he
went
on
speaking
and
perhaps
god
has
taken
this
young
man
from
us
to
remind
us
how
many
other
innocent
lives
may
be
lost
if
we
wage
war
unwisely
simon
and
the
other
five
french
knights
turned
the
wooden
pallet
so
that
alain
head
was
toward
the
altar
and
his
feet
toward
the
church
door
the
weight
had
not
bothered
simon
carrying
alain
into
the
church
but
now
the
burden
seemed
twice
as
heavy
he
was
afraid
as
he
descended
the
stairs
in
front
of
the
cathedral
one
worn
stone
step
at
a
time
that
his
knees
might
buckle
and
he
might
spill
alain
to
the
ground
he
would
be
anxious
until
he
got
alain
back
on
the
cart
that
would
carry
him
to
his
final
resting
place
in
the
cemetery
on
a
hill
to
the
north
of
orvieto
great
rock
where
will
i
go
trying
to
get
de
verceuil
to
change
fra
tomasso
mind
had
been
a
serious
error
in
judgment
every
important
churchman
and
official
in
orvieto
had
heard
the
greatest
thinker
in
christendom
attack
the
plan
of
christians
and
tartars
waging
war
together
on
the
saracens
what
would
happen
now
nothing
would
happen
and
that
was
all
that
was
needed
for
the
alliance
to
fail
the
tartars
would
go
home
they
would
continue
their
war
against
the
saracens
the
war
they
had
been
losing
lately
without
christian
help
and
eventually
the
mameluke
waves
would
roll
over
palestine
and
syria
and
the
christian
strongholds
in
outremer
would
crumble
like
sand
castles
the
escutcheon
of
gobignon
is
a
little
more
tarnished
and
i
have
led
my
dearest
vassal
to
useless
death
whenever
the
tartars
leave
italy
and
it
will
probably
be
soon
i
will
return
to
château
gobignon
a
he
thought
back
to
his
meeting
with
charles
on
the
wall
of
the
louvre
last
july
it
had
seemed
then
that
helping
the
tartars
to
ally
themselves
with
the
christians
was
a
way
to
change
his
whole
life
for
the
better
he
would
take
his
rightful
place
in
the
kingdom
as
a
great
baron
he
would
end
the
shame
and
suffering
he
had
always
lived
with
he
would
hold
his
head
up
among
the
nobility
and
king
louis
and
count
charles
would
love
and
respect
him
now
he
would
accomplish
none
of
those
things
he
had
been
knocked
from
his
horse
and
was
rolling
in
the
dust
he
would
go
back
to
the
living
death
of
being
afraid
to
show
his
face
beyond
the
bounds
of
gobignon
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
he
was
known
and
respected
go
back
to
gobignon
and
never
see
sophia
again
she
at
least
would
not
think
less
of
him
because
the
grand
alliance
had
failed
she
probably
felt
sorry
for
alain
perhaps
even
felt
responsible
for
his
death
simon
should
go
and
reassure
her
and
then
what
bid
her
farewell
he
and
de
puys
on
the
other
side
two
knights
behind
each
of
them
slid
alain
body
with
a
dry
rasping
sound
along
the
unpainted
gray
wood
of
the
cart
bed
the
red
ribbons
on
the
four
tall
cartwheels
fluttered
in
the
slight
breeze
a
thought
that
had
fleetingly
occurred
to
simon
before
now
formed
itself
solidly
in
his
mind
what
if
he
were
to
take
sophia
back
to
gobignon
as
his
bride
many
there
were
who
would
rail
against
him
for
doing
it
his
grandmother
in
particular
herself
the
daughter
of
a
king
would
be
beside
herself
with
fury
king
louis
and
uncle
charles
might
even
try
to
stop
him
but
he
was
the
count
de
gobignon
a
peer
of
the
realm
almost
a
king
in
his
own
right
and
he
had
tried
to
do
what
his
elders
expected
of
him
and
he
had
failed
twice
he
had
loved
women
whose
lands
and
high
birth
made
them
proper
matches
for
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
twice
he
had
been
prevented
from
marrying
the
woman
of
his
choice
because
of
count
amalric
legacy
of
wickedness
well
the
devil
take
all
of
them
if
they
would
not
accept
him
as
a
member
of
the
noblesse
then
he
was
not
obliged
to
behave
as
one
surely
his
mother
and
father
considering
the
way
their
own
marriage
had
come
about
would
understand
and
approve
his
choice
and
somehow
he
doubted
that
cardinal
ugolini
would
raise
any
objection
to
his
marrying
his
niece

open
letter
from
fra
tomasso
of
the
order
of
preaching
friars
to
the
christian
sovereigns
of
europe
from
orvieto
day
of
november
let
us
leave
these
wild
beasts
tartars
and
muslims
alike
to
devour
each
other
that
they
may
all
be
consumed
and
perish
and
we
when
we
proceed
against
the
enemies
of
christ
who
remain
will
slay
them
and
cleanse
the
face
of
the
earth
so
that
all
the
world
will
be
subject
to
the
one
catholic
church
and
there
be
one
shepherd
and
one
fold
when
simon
and
friar
mathieu
climbed
the
stone
steps
into
fra
cell
pushing
up
a
trapdoor
to
enter
he
was
bent
over
a
scroll
he
held
the
two
ends
apart
with
his
fingertips
and
as
he
read
he
very
gently
pushed
down
the
bottom
part
of
the
roll
allowing
the
part
he
had
read
to
roll
up
the
scroll
looked
very
old
and
the
dominican
friar
handled
it
as
if
it
might
fall
apart
in
his
hands
he
did
not
look
up
at
his
two
visitors
his
large
head
moved
ever
so
slightly
from
side
to
side
as
he
scanned
the
lines
of
writing
and
simon
could
hear
his
loud
breathing
just
as
he
had
a
week
ago
in
the
cathedral
simon
and
friar
mathieu
stood
quietly
and
waited
for
fra
tomasso
to
stop
reading
and
notice
them
it
had
taken
friar
mathieu
franciscan
superiors
a
week
of
delicate
negotiations
after
alain
funeral
to
arrange
an
audience
with
the
dominican
philosopher
for
friar
mathieu
and
simon
simon
prayed
feeling
the
sweat
break
out
on
his
forehead
that
their
intrusion
would
not
annoy
fra
tomasso
he
desperately
hoped
that
they
could
persuade
him
to
change
his
mind
about
the
alliance
it
was
really
up
to
friar
mathieu
he
thought
that
simon
could
have
any
effect
on
such
a
brilliant
philosopher
was
unthinkable
simon
noticed
a
single
deep
crease
between
the
great
eyebrows
his
forehead
bulged
on
either
side
of
the
crease
as
if
the
muscles
that
made
him
frown
had
grown
from
much
exercise
the
brows
themselves
were
so
fair
and
sparse
as
to
seem
almost
invisible
fra
tomasso
laid
a
broad
right
hand
on
the
scroll
to
hold
it
open
picked
up
a
feather
pen
with
his
left
hand
dipped
the
sharpened
tip
into
a
tiny
ink
jar
and
began
making
small
rapid
marks
on
a
piece
of
parchment
simon
watched
with
interest
since
his
university
days
he
rarely
saw
people
reading
and
writing
and
could
not
remember
ever
seeing
anyone
write
with
his
left
hand
when
the
pen
ran
dry
fra
tomasso
happened
to
glance
up
as
he
dipped
it
again
dear
lord
forgive
me
he
said
his
eyes
round
with
surprise
friends
i
did
not
hear
you
enter
please
pardon
my
rudeness
simon
was
gratified
to
hear
him
speak
french
and
impressed
by
his
fluency
it
is
we
who
are
guilty
of
rudeness
fra
tomasso
said
friar
mathieu
for
interrupting
your
work
my
brothers
in
christ
are
more
important
than
books
said
the
stout
dominican
gesturing
to
them
to
take
seats
on
his
bed
his
cell
was
a
circular
room
occupying
the
top
floor
of
a
tower
in
the
compound
that
housed
his
order
in
orvieto
the
curved
walls
of
the
room
were
painted
as
white
as
fra
tomasso
robe
a
black
wooden
cross
surmounted
by
a
white
ivory
figure
of
jesus
hung
over
the
bed
fra
tomasso
sat
his
chair
hidden
by
his
great
bulk
with
his
back
to
a
window
at
a
large
trestle
table
with
stacks
of
books
and
boxes
of
scrolls
on
either
side
of
him
his
bed
was
a
wide
sturdy
wooden
platform
covered
with
a
mattress
and
a
blanket
the
size
of
a
galley
sail
a
giant
could
lie
on
that
bed
simon
thought
i
must
admit
this
scroll
is
a
great
treasure
and
i
am
reluctant
to
tear
my
eyes
from
it
he
said
a
hitherto
lost
treatise
of
aristotle
on
the
composition
and
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
this
copy
might
be
over
six
hundred
years
old
in
greek
you
are
familiar
with
philosopher
he
looked
from
friar
mathieu
to
simon
eagerly
i
did
study
for
a
year
at
père
sorbonne
college
in
paris
your
reverence
said
simon
we
read
the
works
of
several
philosophers
fra
tomasso
smiled
indulgently
i
always
refer
to
aristotle
as
philosopher
because
i
can
learn
more
from
him
than
from
any
other
ancient
or
modern
thinker
do
you
not
agree
reverend
father
he
turned
to
friar
mathieu
or
are
you
like
so
many
of
your
fellow
franciscans
uninterested
in
philosophy
god
he
scorns
thought
simon
with
dread
sure
to
i
truly
would
like
to
find
the
time
for
it
said
friar
mathieu
unruffled
but
i
seem
to
be
always
traveling
fra
tomasso
nodded
you
and
that
merchant
from
trebizond
are
the
only
two
christians
in
orvieto
who
have
traveled
among
the
tartars
i
found
your
testimony
at
his
holiness
council
quite
fascinating
but
not
persuasive
friar
mathieu
leaned
forward
intently
simon
caught
his
breath
fra
tomasso
had
given
them
an
opening
i
presumed
that
was
why
you
had
come
to
see
me
said
fra
tomasso
with
a
smile
let
me
assure
you
good
friar
and
noble
count
that
until
a
little
over
a
week
ago
i
had
tried
to
keep
to
a
strict
neutrality
feeling
that
in
that
way
i
could
be
more
useful
to
his
holiness
even
after
hearing
the
tartars
condemn
themselves
out
of
their
own
mouths
at
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
reception
but
then
i
changed
my
mind
let
me
ask
you
a
rather
delicate
question
your
reverence
said
friar
mathieu
fra
tomasso
leaned
back
and
rested
his
hands
fingers
laced
on
his
huge
belly
any
question
at
all
did
cardinal
de
verceuil
behavior
toward
you
have
anything
to
do
with
your
change
of
mind
the
crease
in
the
dominican
philosopher
forehead
deepened
simon
winced
inwardly
what
if
now
they
had
truly
offended
fra
tomasso
surely
you
do
not
suggest
that
i
would
let
personal
pique
determine
my
position
on
a
matter
so
important
to
the
future
of
christendom
i
am
not
surprised
knowing
your
reverence
reputation
that
you
grasp
just
how
important
the
matter
is
friar
mathieu
said
neatly
sidestepping
fra
tomasso
question
simon
thought
exactly
thus
it
was
that
when
cardinal
de
verceuil
went
to
fra
augustino
da
varda
my
superior
general
demanding
that
he
order
me
to
change
my
position
on
the
tartars
i
realized
it
was
time
for
me
to
come
to
a
conclusion
i
made
a
terrible
mistake
said
friar
mathieu
as
much
to
himself
and
simon
as
to
fra
tomasso
may
god
forgive
me
what
mistake
was
that
asked
fra
tomasso
not
trying
to
discuss
this
with
your
reverence
myself
as
i
am
doing
now
to
be
honest
i
feared
you
would
not
care
to
meet
with
a
poor
franciscan
again
you
do
me
an
injustice
said
fra
tomasso
philosopher
tells
us
that
we
acquire
knowledge
first
of
all
through
the
senses
therefore
if
you
would
know
about
something
ask
of
those
who
have
seen
it
firsthand
then
perhaps
you
have
new
questions
said
friar
mathieu
simon
felt
despair
pressing
on
him
like
a
mail
shirt
that
was
too
heavy
fra
tomasso
was
a
man
whose
whole
life
was
argument
how
could
friar
mathieu
hope
to
persuade
him
to
change
his
mind
about
anything
his
chair
creaking
loudly
fra
tomasso
leaned
forward
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
i
am
so
sure
of
my
conclusions
that
i
have
written
to
emperor
sigismund
in
germany
king
boleslav
in
poland
and
king
wenceslas
in
hungary
all
lands
that
have
suffered
from
the
depredations
of
the
tartars
urging
them
to
beg
his
holiness
to
repudiate
this
scheme
that
will
bring
the
frontier
of
tartary
so
much
closer
to
us
i
have
written
to
king
louis
of
france
your
liege
lord
too
young
count
de
gobignon
even
though
he
is
said
to
be
eager
for
a
pact
with
the
tartars
furthermore
father
da
varda
is
considering
my
proposal
that
the
dominican
order
all
over
christendom
preach
against
an
alliance
with
the
tartars
hearing
in
fra
tomasso
words
the
ruin
of
all
his
hopes
simon
could
not
contain
himself
he
burst
out
fra
tomasso
looked
surprised
even
a
bit
affronted
for
all
the
reasons
you
heard
in
church
last
friday
they
are
not
simple
savages
my
young
friend
they
are
diabolical
it
was
hopeless
simon
heart
sank
lower
and
lower
the
great
preacher
mind
was
made
up
yes
but
your
reverence
simon
felt
driven
by
desperation
to
debate
with
a
man
whom
he
knew
was
invincible
in
argument
we
all
know
of
many
times
when
christians
and
saracens
have
been
just
as
cruel
friar
mathieu
gave
a
little
grunt
of
agreement
fra
tomasso
looked
down
at
his
thumbs
the
tips
pressed
together
as
they
rested
on
his
wide
belly
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
he
was
thinking
simon
realized
hardly
ever
had
simon
seen
a
man
stop
to
think
before
speaking
in
an
argument
he
began
to
tremble
inwardly
expecting
to
be
crushed
fra
tomasso
raised
a
fat
finger
yes
i
know
that
christian
knights
have
also
committed
barbarities
but
they
did
so
in
mindless
rage
and
afterward
they
were
ashamed
even
the
mohammedan
faith
teaches
the
saracens
to
wage
only
just
wars
to
be
compassionate
to
spare
the
innocent
and
helpless
i
stipulate
that
neither
christians
nor
mohammedans
live
up
to
these
laws
but
they
them
the
tartars
have
no
such
laws
in
their
bottomless
ignorance
they
think
that
it
is
to
commit
deeds
of
unimaginable
horror
and
they
do
it
with
calculation
exemplum
as
david
of
trebizond
has
told
me
when
they
wipe
out
the
population
of
a
city
they
know
there
will
be
a
few
survivors
so
weeks
later
they
return
to
the
ruins
when
the
remaining
few
people
have
emerged
from
hiding
and
they
slaughter
them
all
that
is
the
worst
sort
of
evil
evil
done
with
utter
deliberation
of
trebizond
may
he
roast
in
hell
thought
simon
with
respect
your
reverence
said
friar
mathieu
the
tartars
have
lived
isolated
in
their
prairie
homeland
since
the
beginning
of
time
but
i
beg
of
you
to
believe
that
they
can
be
won
to
the
mercy
of
christ
i
have
seen
it
i
have
it
are
gaining
simon
thought
if
fra
tomasso
really
could
be
swayed
by
the
testimony
of
a
person
who
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
they
had
a
chance
a
hammering
from
beneath
the
floor
made
simon
start
someone
was
knocking
on
the
trapdoor
friar
mathieu
nibbled
at
his
mustache
in
vexation
while
fra
tomasso
smiled
broadly
and
called
come
up
the
heavy
door
creaked
upward
pushed
by
a
hand
in
a
white
sleeve
a
shiny
tonsured
scalp
reflected
the
light
from
the
tower
window
the
young
dominican
who
emerged
was
almost
too
breathless
to
speak
reverend
father
news
from
bolsena
un
miracolo
fra
tomasso
eyes
widened
bolsena
is
that
near
here
so
near
reverend
father
that
the
miracle
happened
yesterday
and
the
news
reached
us
this
afternoon
what
miracle
a
foreign
priest
from
some
eastern
country
was
saying
mass
and
when
he
got
to
the
consecration
and
raised
the
sacred
host
the
young
friar
eyes
glowed
the
host
dripped
blood
simon
head
spun
in
confusion
frustrated
rage
at
being
interrupted
when
they
were
so
close
to
victory
struggled
with
amazement
at
this
tale
of
a
bleeding
communion
wafer
he
looked
at
fra
tomasso
and
all
hope
ebbed
away
the
philosopher
face
fairly
glowed
with
relief
sadness
swelled
in
simon
they
did
not
have
a
chance
perhaps
they
had
never
had
one
before
they
knew
it
it
seemed
friar
mathieu
and
simon
were
walking
together
out
the
gate
of
the
dominican
convent
behind
them
there
were
shouts
and
friars
bustling
to
and
fro
like
a
flock
of
startled
doves
the
whole
convent
it
seemed
was
in
an
uproar
over
the
miracle
at
bolsena
fra
tomasso
had
courteously
but
firmly
dismissed
mathieu
and
simon
saying
that
he
must
question
the
one
who
brought
the
news
he
might
he
said
be
called
upon
to
look
further
into
the
event
at
bolsena
and
he
must
be
fully
prepared
simon
had
wanted
to
protest
if
fra
tomasso
would
only
give
them
a
little
more
time
he
would
surely
have
to
change
his
mind
about
the
tartars
but
simon
sensed
that
fra
tomasso
did
not
want
to
change
his
mind
the
sky
was
cold
and
gray
as
chain
mail
carters
horsemen
and
laborers
on
foot
bustled
along
their
cloaks
pulled
tight
around
them
against
the
chill
north
wind
is
simon
thought
as
he
had
after
alain
funeral
just
when
they
were
gaining
ground
with
fra
tomasso
news
of
a
miracle
was
god
himself
against
them
skulking
back
to
gobignon
forever
to
be
known
not
as
the
count
who
helped
liberate
jerusalem
but
as
the
son
of
the
traitor
amalric
i
should
give
it
all
up
and
become
a
franciscan
like
friar
where
did
he
get
that
scroll
friar
mathieu
wondered
what
can
we
do
now
said
simon
he
was
not
really
asking
it
was
only
a
way
of
saying
he
thought
nothing
could
be
done
he
was
in
despair
over
the
failure
of
their
mission
then
he
thought
of
sophia
in
an
instant
a
light
bloomed
within
him
skulking
back
to
gobignon
no
riding
back
in
triumph
with
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
beside
him
as
his
bride
he
had
not
yet
nerved
himself
to
propose
to
sophia
but
now
that
they
had
failed
with
fra
tomasso
he
could
not
wait
to
see
her
again
friar
mathieu
scratched
his
white
beard
thoughtfully
it
was
de
verceuil
who
tipped
the
scales
against
the
tartars
and
it
was
we
who
sent
de
verceuil
i
thought
this
might
be
the
one
time
he
could
be
useful
to
us
fra
tomasso
had
already
sided
with
ugolini
faction
simon
said
that
is
why
we
sent
de
verceuil
he
told
us
today
that
he
had
been
trying
to
be
neutral
said
friar
mathieu
but
sophia
told
you
that
fra
tomasso
had
already
sided
with
ugolini
party
do
you
suppose
the
great
dominican
was
not
being
candid
with
us
or
was
it
sophia
who
was
not
being
candid
simon
gasped
at
the
sudden
pain
of
a
blow
that
was
worse
than
their
failure
with
fra
tomasso
sophia
not
honest
no
he
could
not
live
with
that
he
stiffened
so
suddenly
that
his
horse
stopped
walking
he
stared
at
friar
mathieu
in
dismay
friar
mathieu
reached
over
and
put
his
hand
on
simon
arm
his
touch
was
light
but
firm
know
where
you
are
going
simon
do
not
travel
blindly
simon
nodded
there
was
a
way
to
find
out
the
truth
about
sophia
he
must
put
sordello
to
work
the
mere
thought
of
that
blackguard
spying
on
sophia
twisted
his
heart
with
anguish
but
he
had
to
know
the
truth
xxxviii
letter
from
emir
daoud
ibn
abdallah
to
el
malik
baibars
from
orvieto
day
of
muharram
o
pillar
of
the
faith
the
gift
of
the
ancient
scroll
to
the
christian
scholar
tomasso
has
served
our
purposes
beyond
my
expectations
at
the
same
time
that
i
delivered
the
scroll
to
him
i
arranged
for
the
allies
of
the
tartars
to
be
deceived
into
thinking
that
the
priest
tomasso
was
already
in
our
camp
they
chose
the
arrogant
cardinal
de
verceuil
of
whom
i
have
told
you
to
bring
his
influence
to
bear
on
the
priest
tomasso
the
treatment
of
tomasso
so
offended
him
that
he
was
driven
to
take
the
side
we
wished
of
him
this
tomasso
has
turned
the
clouds
ugolini
and
i
stirred
up
into
a
veritable
thunderstorm
the
pope
can
not
proclaim
a
crusade
unless
he
has
the
support
of
the
christian
kingdoms
and
peoples
otherwise
they
will
support
him
only
halfheartedly
or
not
at
all
i
confess
i
am
surprised
at
how
often
the
christians
of
europe
choose
to
neglect
or
even
refuse
to
do
what
the
pope
demands
of
them
as
we
know
the
christians
of
today
have
not
the
zeal
to
make
war
on
us
that
their
forefathers
had
let
time
pass
and
hulagu
khan
will
lose
patience
and
recall
his
ambassadors
the
christians
will
fight
among
themselves
here
in
europe
and
if
god
wills
it
islam
will
know
peace
such
is
my
deepest
desire
time
o
malik
dahir
is
our
ally
daoud
stood
at
his
writing
desk
smiling
at
the
tiny
arabic
characters
with
which
he
had
covered
the
thin
square
of
parchment
el
malik
dahir
the
victorious
king
how
well
daoud
remembered
the
day
baibars
had
with
his
help
assumed
that
title
riding
back
from
the
victory
at
the
well
of
goliath
the
mameluke
army
was
camped
outside
bilbeis
two
days
ride
northeast
of
el
kahira
tomorrow
sultan
qutuz
would
hold
audience
at
bilbeis
and
soon
after
he
would
ride
into
el
kahira
in
triumph
a
triumph
baibars
had
earned
for
him
baibars
was
alone
in
his
tent
when
daoud
answered
his
summons
his
blue
eye
glittered
out
of
deep
shadows
cast
on
his
face
by
a
small
oil
lamp
that
hung
in
the
center
of
the
tent
with
his
own
hand
baibars
served
daoud
kaviyeh
from
a
pot
on
a
brazier
and
the
two
men
sat
side
by
side
turned
toward
each
other
again
he
refused
me
baibars
said
i
have
given
him
every
chance
daoud
baibars
face
was
calm
but
daoud
knew
that
the
fury
of
a
tartar
was
boiling
within
him
a
reddish
haze
obscured
the
tent
for
daoud
as
he
fought
back
his
own
rage
at
the
injustice
to
baibars
he
thinks
i
want
to
be
governor
of
aleppo
merely
out
of
ambition
baibars
said
the
sultan
is
a
fool
said
daoud
the
single
sighted
eye
transfixed
him
no
not
a
fool
he
played
the
game
of
power
well
enough
when
he
made
himself
sultan
no
one
could
blame
him
for
the
murders
of
ai
beg
and
spray
of
pearls
he
restored
order
to
el
kahira
his
mistake
now
is
in
not
trusting
me
and
that
is
an
understandable
mistake
baibars
stretched
his
thin
lips
in
a
sudden
grin
understandable
how
daoud
experienced
that
unsettling
sense
he
often
had
that
the
emir
was
always
two
or
three
jumps
ahead
of
him
it
comes
of
too
much
cleverness
said
baibars
he
does
not
believe
me
when
i
say
i
want
to
be
governor
of
aleppo
because
it
is
the
first
city
hulagu
khan
will
attack
he
suspects
me
of
a
hidden
motive
he
thinks
that
if
he
gives
me
aleppo
i
will
break
with
el
kahira
and
claim
all
of
syria
for
my
own
because
that
is
what
would
do
but
hulagu
khan
seeking
vengeance
for
the
well
of
goliath
is
coming
from
persia
with
all
his
power
may
god
send
to
the
eternal
fire
a
commander
wicked
enough
to
divide
the
kingdom
at
such
a
time
the
kaviyeh
daoud
held
had
cooled
he
drained
the
glazed
earthenware
cup
and
put
it
down
beside
him
the
sultan
himself
divides
the
kingdom
said
daoud
by
dishonoring
you
it
is
more
than
dishonor
it
is
war
if
he
thinks
me
too
dangerous
to
be
ruler
of
aleppo
it
means
that
he
thinks
me
too
dangerous
to
live
daoud
felt
as
if
his
heart
had
dropped
into
the
cold
black
bottom
of
a
well
if
qutuz
destroyed
baibars
he
would
destroy
islam
and
el
kahira
and
all
of
them
daoud
whole
world
what
will
you
do
said
daoud
i
do
not
know
what
i
will
do
said
baibars
fixing
his
one
eye
on
daoud
but
you
know
that
if
he
kills
me
he
will
kill
all
close
to
me
what
will
do
daoud
felt
the
edge
of
the
headsman
blade
on
the
back
of
his
neck
as
he
had
not
felt
it
since
that
day
qutuz
demanded
his
death
the
thought
of
being
executed
at
qutuz
command
outraged
him
it
was
one
thing
to
die
as
a
mujahid
a
martyr
in
holy
war
for
islam
destined
to
be
taken
at
once
into
paradise
but
what
a
shameful
fate
to
be
murdered
because
your
own
sovereign
lord
did
not
trust
you
i
am
your
slave
effendi
not
slave
daoud
you
are
as
near
a
son
to
me
as
a
mameluke
can
be
are
you
not
the
husband
of
my
favorite
daughter
i
speak
now
with
you
because
i
must
speak
and
in
all
this
camp
you
are
the
only
one
i
can
rely
on
absolutely
daoud
felt
tears
coming
to
his
eyes
he
was
embarrassed
even
though
he
knew
it
was
a
manly
thing
to
weep
easily
for
him
crying
was
rare
baibars
rested
a
large
strong
hand
on
daoud
arm
never
to
know
any
brothers
but
our
khushdashiya
our
barracks
mates
never
to
know
any
father
but
the
emir
who
trained
and
freed
us
it
makes
us
the
hardest
the
finest
warriors
in
the
world
but
we
long
for
the
loving
families
we
never
had
daoud
wiped
his
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
while
daoud
stroking
his
thick
blond
beard
grappled
with
what
baibars
was
asking
of
him
asking
not
in
words
but
in
the
spaces
between
the
words
baibars
spoke
remember
what
the
tartar
general
ket
bogha
called
qutuz
the
murderer
of
his
master
the
world
belittles
us
because
each
sultan
has
climbed
to
the
throne
over
the
murdered
body
of
the
last
sultan
turan
shah
murdered
he
held
up
his
left
hand
his
sword
hand
i
myself
killed
turan
shah
because
he
betrayed
the
mamelukes
next
ai
beg
murdered
the
sultana
spray
of
pearls
murdered
ali
son
of
ai
beg
murdered
each
murder
weakens
the
throne
itself
the
throne
is
as
strong
as
the
man
who
holds
it
said
daoud
baibars
continued
to
look
at
his
left
hand
his
head
turned
to
the
side
in
his
way
even
so
ai
beg
did
not
himself
kill
turan
shah
and
qutuz
did
not
himself
kill
ali
if
i
kill
qutuz
and
take
the
throne
with
his
blood
on
my
hand
i
am
inviting
every
other
mameluke
emir
to
kill
me
when
my
back
is
turned
the
title
of
el
malik
the
sultan
chief
sovereign
of
islam
will
be
like
a
ball
in
a
game
of
mall
flying
this
way
and
that
daoud
felt
as
if
he
were
standing
at
the
mouth
of
an
enormous
black
cave
it
was
one
thing
to
know
that
qutuz
was
not
fit
to
rule
it
was
another
thing
to
think
of
striking
down
the
sultan
the
anointed
of
god
if
daoud
entered
this
cave
he
might
never
come
out
again
he
might
leave
it
only
to
fall
into
the
flames
of
hell
he
seemed
to
see
stars
in
the
depths
of
the
cave
as
if
he
were
looking
into
the
world
beyond
the
world
somewhere
among
those
stars
god
dwelt
in
his
paradise
with
those
he
loved
around
him
the
archangel
gabriel
and
the
prophet
and
abraham
and
jesus
and
the
saints
and
martyrs
of
islam
it
god
will
that
i
kill
the
sultan
how
can
i
know
he
could
not
know
but
he
did
know
that
second
only
to
his
submission
to
god
the
most
important
thing
in
his
life
was
devotion
to
his
emir
as
baibars
said
his
khushdashiya
and
his
emir
were
all
a
mameluke
had
he
leaned
closer
to
baibars
whoever
dishonors
my
lord
baibars
deserves
instant
death
at
the
hands
of
my
lord
servant
baibars
closed
both
eyes
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
have
i
asked
you
to
kill
anyone
he
said
no
effendi
they
sat
in
silence
again
the
desert
wind
hummed
in
the
ropes
of
baibars
tent
and
the
poles
shifted
and
creaked
if
someone
wished
to
kill
qutuz
said
baibars
he
should
recall
that
we
are
now
very
close
to
el
kahira
once
qutuz
rides
on
streets
festooned
with
silks
and
carpeted
with
flowers
once
people
see
him
as
the
victor
of
the
well
of
goliath
they
will
love
him
too
much
they
would
never
accept
his
being
taken
from
them
we
could
not
control
their
fury
daoud
said
tomorrow
when
he
holds
audience
at
the
palace
of
the
governor
of
bilbeis
men
from
all
over
the
district
with
requests
for
favors
with
claims
with
grievances
will
surround
him
clamoring
anyone
could
easily
approach
him
baibars
nodded
let
him
be
struck
down
before
the
eyes
of
many
let
it
be
like
a
public
sacrifice
i
would
rather
see
it
done
so
than
by
poison
or
ambush
his
thin
lips
curved
in
a
smile
i
seem
to
recall
that
you
too
have
a
preference
for
taking
vengeance
in
public
if
the
other
emirs
demand
that
he
who
killed
the
sultan
be
punished
said
daoud
you
will
have
to
sacrifice
your
servant
baibars
face
tightened
they
will
not
they
will
accept
what
you
and
i
do
nevertheless
if
it
seems
needful
to
secure
your
place
on
the
throne
you
must
give
the
killer
up
you
will
not
have
to
explain
that
to
me
and
you
will
still
be
my
lord
my
father
ah
daoud
baibars
said
daoud
saw
a
wetness
in
both
baibars
eyes
now
the
sighted
and
the
blind
daoud
stood
beside
a
spiral
pillar
near
the
front
of
the
audience
hall
of
the
governor
of
bilbeis
it
was
a
small
chamber
but
an
elegant
one
the
floor
was
of
mottled
green
marble
and
pink
columns
lined
the
approach
from
the
front
door
to
the
massive
gilded
throne
on
its
dais
merchants
and
small
landholders
officials
in
red
fezzes
bedouin
sheikhs
in
black
robes
and
burnooses
crowded
the
hall
each
man
held
a
petition
scroll
for
the
sultan
daoud
carried
no
petition
but
the
sleeve
of
his
left
arm
hid
strapped
to
his
wrist
a
scabbard
holding
a
twisting
dagger
a
flame
dagger
the
weapon
of
the
hashishiyya
he
longed
for
qutuz
to
come
into
the
hall
for
the
dance
of
death
he
had
rehearsed
a
thousand
times
in
his
mind
to
begin
he
had
prayed
this
morning
longer
and
with
greater
fervor
than
he
had
for
many
years
would
qutuz
come
at
the
doorways
and
around
the
edges
of
the
room
stood
warriors
of
the
halkha
the
sultan
bodyguard
their
steel
helmets
and
breastplates
inlaid
with
gold
their
tunics
bright
yellow
what
would
they
do
when
they
saw
him
strike
at
qutuz
they
were
mamelukes
they
had
seen
fear
at
the
well
of
goliath
and
his
pretensions
afterward
but
it
was
their
duty
to
protect
him
daoud
could
not
guess
what
feelings
would
move
them
here
and
there
around
the
room
rose
the
spherical
white
turbans
of
the
mameluke
emirs
who
had
been
at
the
well
of
goliath
there
was
kalawun
called
the
thousander
because
his
first
master
had
bought
him
for
the
incredible
price
of
a
thousand
gold
dinars
there
bektout
beside
a
pillar
another
kipchaq
like
baibars
six
or
so
others
talked
quietly
under
the
pointed
arch
of
the
public
entrance
to
the
audience
chamber
none
of
the
emirs
paid
attention
to
the
petitioners
who
streamed
past
them
into
the
room
in
the
corner
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
dais
baibars
stood
alone
a
head
taller
than
anyone
around
him
he
swung
his
head
from
side
to
side
so
that
he
could
survey
the
room
with
his
one
good
eye
his
glance
seemed
to
pass
over
daoud
without
seeing
him
a
side
door
to
the
throne
room
from
the
governor
private
apartments
swung
open
and
two
officers
of
the
halkha
strode
through
one
of
the
officers
drew
himself
up
and
shouted
the
beloved
of
god
the
victor
of
the
well
of
goliath
el
malik
qutuz
the
buzz
of
conversation
in
the
room
at
once
stilled
and
heartbeat
filled
his
ears
then
a
roar
arose
as
qutuz
entered
briskly
arrayed
in
a
bejeweled
green
turban
and
a
black
and
silver
robe
of
honor
his
chamberlain
a
stout
man
carrying
a
basket
followed
him
the
petitioners
rushed
forward
clamoring
and
waving
their
scrolls
the
men
of
the
halkha
made
no
attempt
to
hold
them
back
a
merchant
in
a
blue
robe
was
the
first
to
reach
qutuz
and
he
hugged
the
sultan
weeping
he
first
thrust
a
small
silk
bag
into
qutuz
hand
which
disappeared
quickly
under
the
sultan
black
robe
then
pressed
a
scroll
upon
him
qutuz
handed
the
scroll
to
his
chamberlain
who
put
it
into
the
basket
the
petitioners
were
the
people
of
islam
and
it
was
their
right
as
it
had
been
since
the
days
of
the
prophet
to
clamor
for
their
attention
and
though
they
might
shout
and
beg
and
even
manhandle
the
sultan
he
must
endure
it
because
these
were
the
richest
men
of
the
district
the
men
of
highest
rank
those
on
whom
the
sultan
power
in
this
place
depended
qutuz
enjoyed
daoud
knew
playing
father
to
his
people
and
though
one
might
think
the
sultan
of
el
kahira
had
wealth
enough
he
was
not
averse
to
increasing
it
with
the
gifts
of
gold
and
jewels
offered
him
on
occasions
like
this
qutuz
moved
slowly
through
the
petitioners
head
high
his
oiled
beard
pointed
like
the
prow
of
a
majestic
ship
a
small
indulgent
smile
played
about
his
lips
he
allowed
them
to
impede
his
progress
to
the
throne
the
petitioners
crowded
around
him
some
plucking
at
his
sleeve
some
falling
at
his
feet
some
pulling
at
the
hem
of
his
robe
even
kissing
it
in
their
urgency
another
man
this
one
a
sheikh
in
desert
robes
seized
the
sultan
in
an
embrace
bellowing
his
entreaty
this
time
when
qutuz
stopped
he
disappeared
behind
a
forest
of
upraised
arms
the
babble
of
voices
each
one
trying
to
outshout
the
other
made
daoud
head
ache
men
elbowed
those
beside
them
and
pushed
their
hands
into
one
another
faces
daoud
even
saw
one
man
claw
his
way
up
the
backs
of
two
who
stood
in
front
of
him
and
climb
over
their
shoulders
to
get
closer
to
qutuz
from
his
position
near
the
front
of
the
hall
daoud
could
catch
only
glimpses
of
the
sultan
green
turban
from
time
to
time
and
follow
his
progress
by
watching
where
the
turmoil
was
fiercest
the
melee
was
like
one
of
those
towering
dust
storms
that
whirl
across
the
desert
and
qutuz
was
at
the
center
when
daoud
judged
that
qutuz
was
halfway
to
the
throne
he
began
to
move
he
plunged
now
into
that
black
cave
where
god
dwelt
somewhere
in
infinite
spaces
doubt
and
fear
he
left
at
the
mouth
of
that
cave
he
must
give
all
his
strength
and
will
to
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
charged
into
the
storm
around
qutuz
though
these
magistrates
and
merchants
were
feeble
compared
to
him
their
frenzy
and
the
mere
weight
of
their
struggling
bodies
formed
a
wall
that
took
all
his
strength
to
break
through
each
man
was
so
intent
upon
his
own
desperate
need
to
reach
the
sultan
that
none
of
them
seemed
to
feel
daoud
forcing
his
way
past
them
qutuz
saw
him
coming
the
dark
brown
eyes
met
daoud
questioning
frowning
a
mameluke
emir
of
daoud
rank
did
not
usually
join
a
crowd
of
petitioners
the
sultan
arms
and
hands
were
full
of
scrolls
his
chamberlain
had
long
since
been
carried
away
from
him
in
the
crush
oh
sultan
grant
my
prayer
daoud
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
your
qutuz
jaw
clenched
and
his
eyes
widened
in
the
beginning
of
fear
as
daoud
bore
down
on
him
daoud
had
reached
the
center
of
the
storm
color
and
movement
whirled
about
him
shouts
deafened
him
he
forced
his
mind
to
blot
out
the
chaos
all
around
and
to
focus
totally
on
qutuz
he
made
himself
as
oblivious
to
the
shrieking
men
around
him
as
they
were
to
him
he
threw
his
arms
around
the
sultan
crushing
the
satin
of
his
kaftan
and
his
armload
of
scrolls
against
his
body
when
daoud
arms
came
together
behind
qutuz
back
his
right
hand
reached
into
his
left
sleeve
and
pulled
the
dagger
from
its
sheath
qutuz
hands
pushed
against
daoud
chest
so
tight
was
daoud
embrace
that
he
felt
the
sultan
take
a
deep
breath
to
cry
for
help
they
were
locked
together
like
lovers
daoud
stretched
out
his
right
arm
and
then
with
all
the
strength
in
that
arm
drove
the
dagger
into
the
sultan
back
he
struck
for
the
center
of
the
back
between
two
ribs
so
that
the
point
would
reach
and
stop
qutuz
heart
his
thrust
went
true
the
strong
lean
body
jerked
violently
then
went
limp
in
his
arms
qutuz
was
a
weight
against
him
sliding
downward
daoud
was
sure
he
was
already
dead
because
he
did
not
move
or
cry
out
triumph
blazed
up
within
him
he
had
done
it
he
had
killed
the
sultan
daoud
let
go
of
the
dagger
in
qutuz
back
he
stepped
backward
quickly
pressing
himself
into
the
crowd
around
them
his
heartbeat
was
thundering
in
his
ears
and
his
knees
were
quivering
qutuz
toppled
toward
him
as
he
moved
back
the
sultan
falls
a
man
next
to
him
screamed
hands
reached
out
to
catch
qutuz
as
he
fell
cries
of
the
sultan
has
fainted
god
help
us
the
sultan
is
hurt
went
up
all
around
daoud
he
continued
to
back
away
through
the
crowd
if
attacked
he
had
decided
he
would
draw
his
saif
and
fight
if
he
must
die
he
desperately
wanted
to
die
fighting
not
on
the
headsman
block
he
had
not
truly
believed
he
could
strike
qutuz
down
without
being
seen
but
no
one
was
yet
pointing
at
him
blood
someone
shrieked
a
dagger
the
shrieks
and
prayers
were
deafening
all
the
men
who
had
clustered
around
the
fallen
sultan
backed
away
daoud
was
carried
farther
from
the
dead
qutuz
by
the
crowd
craning
his
neck
over
the
heads
around
him
he
could
see
the
body
lying
sprawled
face
down
on
the
green
marble
floor
a
spreading
bright
red
stain
in
the
black
and
silver
robes
around
the
dagger
hilt
the
babble
of
voices
was
so
confused
that
daoud
could
no
longer
tell
what
anyone
was
saying
mansur
ibn
ziri
commander
of
the
halkha
and
anis
master
of
the
hunt
pushed
their
way
through
to
qutuz
body
while
some
men
still
clutching
scrolls
ran
from
the
chamber
they
must
fear
even
being
in
the
room
where
the
sultan
was
murdered
have
killed
the
though
his
whole
body
shook
with
reaction
and
his
limbs
felt
weak
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
his
hand
on
his
sword
hilt
daoud
surveyed
the
large
chamber
the
mameluke
emirs
were
looking
not
at
qutuz
body
but
at
one
another
and
they
kept
glancing
at
daoud
had
seen
daoud
throw
his
arms
around
qutuz
they
knew
who
had
killed
qutuz
and
they
knew
why
he
had
done
it
baibars
still
stood
apart
in
a
far
corner
his
good
eye
met
daoud
but
his
face
was
a
mask
as
the
last
of
the
local
men
fled
the
place
of
death
a
silence
fell
over
the
room
the
mamelukes
were
alone
with
the
body
of
their
sultan
the
men
of
the
halkha
the
sultan
they
were
sworn
to
protect
now
dead
looked
at
the
emirs
the
only
voices
now
were
the
murmured
words
of
mansur
and
anis
as
they
bent
over
qutuz
body
with
an
effort
mansur
pulled
the
dagger
from
qutuz
back
anis
grunted
when
he
saw
the
twisting
blade
heart
hammering
daoud
tensed
himself
would
mansur
turn
and
accuse
him
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
no
one
was
behind
him
and
took
gliding
steps
backward
until
his
shoulders
were
pressed
against
a
pillar
mansur
said
in
a
voice
that
carried
through
the
room
the
flame
dagger
our
lord
has
been
struck
down
by
the
hashishiyya
daoud
almost
laughed
aloud
with
relief
with
an
immense
effort
he
held
himself
rigid
his
fists
clenched
so
tightly
at
his
side
they
hurt
mansur
was
telling
everyone
who
knew
what
had
happened
what
they
were
to
tell
everyone
who
did
not
know
would
anyone
contradict
mansur
no
one
did
relief
spread
through
him
carefully
almost
delicately
mansur
laid
the
dagger
on
the
floor
beside
qutuz
he
stood
up
wiping
his
hands
on
his
mantle
with
rapid
strides
the
commander
of
the
halkha
crossed
the
chamber
toward
baibars
to
arrest
him
what
choice
had
mansur
made
to
bow
deeply
before
baibars
he
made
a
graceful
sweeping
gesture
toward
the
vacant
throne
my
lord
the
power
is
yours
to
god
baibars
gaze
paused
for
an
instant
daoud
saw
as
it
fell
upon
each
of
the
emirs
in
the
look
he
fixed
upon
each
there
was
both
question
and
challenge
some
of
the
emirs
bowed
their
turbaned
heads
slightly
others
like
kalawun
simply
looked
back
at
him
in
silence
and
that
was
assent
enough
baibars
raised
his
right
hand
toward
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
wide
sleeve
of
his
robe
falling
away
from
his
powerful
arm
with
your
help
o
god
he
did
not
shout
but
his
deep
voice
carried
through
the
room
slowly
but
with
a
terrible
firmness
he
walked
across
the
room
so
quiet
was
the
audience
chamber
that
daoud
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
could
hear
the
scrape
of
baibars
boots
on
the
three
marble
steps
to
the
throne
baibars
turned
and
sat
on
the
throne
resting
his
hands
on
its
arms
he
leaned
back
a
little
and
his
eye
seemed
to
rest
on
some
spot
above
and
beyond
the
heads
of
those
who
watched
him
mansur
ibn
ziri
turned
to
an
officer
of

pray
for
the
long
life
of
your
sultan
baibars
me
hail
him
thought
daoud
if
he
wants
to
kill
me
for
what
i
did
let
it
be
trembling
with
exhilaration
he
strode
through
the
crowd
and
up
the
center
of
the
room
toward
the
throne
lord
sultan
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
el
malik
dahir
victorious
king
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
prostrated
himself
striking
his
forehead
on
the
hard
cold
floor
hearing
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
daoud
rolled
up
the
slip
of
thin
parchment
and
dropped
it
into
the
purse
at
his
belt
sordello
entered
at
his
command
greeting
and
saluting
him
i
see
you
are
one
of
us
messer
david
one
of
who
sordello
pointed
to
the
writing
desk
where
daoud
had
been
standing
and
the
sheaf
of
quill
pens
one
who
had
his
letters
i
write
down
all
my
songs
daoud
had
no
wish
to
feel
kinship
with
sordello
the
bravo
had
not
bothered
to
clean
the
whiskers
from
his
face
for
several
days
and
there
was
gray
stubble
like
fur
under
his
nose
and
on
his
cheeks
and
chin
a
man
should
grow
a
beard
daoud
thought
or
keep
his
cheeks
smooth
what
brings
you
to
me
daoud
asked
curtly
the
count
de
gobignon
sent
a
message
to
me
by
way
of
ana
the
bulgarian
woman
would
you
care
to
read
it
de
gobignon
note
read
the
lady
sophia
cardinal
ugolini
niece
has
represented
herself
to
me
as
an
honest
woman
who
knows
nothing
of
politics
and
takes
sides
neither
for
nor
against
the
tartar
alliance
find
out
if
she
is
telling
the
truth
report
to
me
in
three
days
time
daoud
felt
pleased
with
himself
turning
sordello
into
a
spy
for
himself
was
yielding
useful
results
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
frenchman
was
suspicious
of
sophia
she
was
so
close
to
the
party
opposing
the
alliance
how
could
he
think
otherwise
but
now
daoud
thought
happily
they
had
the
means
to
put
his
suspicions
to
rest
daoud
handed
the
note
back
to
sordello
saying
that
is
short
and
to
the
point
but
he
does
not
tell
you
how
you
are
to
learn
whether
madonna
sophia
is
telling
him
the
truth
or
not
i
could
tell
him
that
i
have
sung
at
dinner
for
the
household
said
sordello
i
could
report
a
conversation
at
table
which
shows
madonna
sophia
to
be
the
innocent
he
would
like
to
think
she
is
you
keep
talking
about
your
songs
and
your
singing
daoud
said
answer
me
truly
are
you
any
good
at
those
things
sordello
shrugged
i
could
claim
to
be
one
of
the
finest
trovatores
in
all
italy
but
if
i
did
you
would
rightfully
ask
why
i
have
to
make
my
living
as
a
hired
so
i
will
say
only
that
i
am
good
enough
that
i
wish
i
could
spend
all
my
time
making
poetry
and
singing
a
worthy
wish
daoud
thought
hearing
his
careful
respect
for
the
man
increased
a
bit
then
you
sing
at
the
cardinal
table
your
suggestion
is
a
good
one
i
will
also
arrange
for
you
to
be
with
madonna
sophia
at
other
times
as
well
so
that
you
can
honestly
claim
to
know
something
about
her
very
good
messer
david
sordello
turned
to
go
then
turned
back
again
messere
yes
do
you
think
you
might
send
me
on
another
trip
to
paradise
sometime
soon
the
eager
light
in
his
eyes
sickened
daoud
do
your
work
well
and
i
will
see
that
you
are
properly
rewarded
sordello
left
and
daoud
brooded
over
his
shame
at
what
he
had
done
to
the
man
turned
him
into
something
less
than
human
less
than
animal
a
kind
of
demon
with
a
single
appetite
after
a
moment
he
forced
himself
to
put
that
out
of
his
mind
a
fighter
in
jihad
holy
war
must
do
many
an
ugly
thing
but
all
was
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
xxxix
the
hymn
o
salutaris
hostia
sung
by
over
a
thousand
strong
voices
abetted
by
several
thousand
more
uncertain
ones
echoed
from
the
hillsides
the
entire
clergy
of
orvieto
from
the
pope
down
to
the
lowliest
subdeacon
had
come
out
of
the
city
and
so
had
most
of
the
lay
population
but
daoud
attention
was
drawn
not
by
the
great
procession
coming
down
the
cliffside
road
or
by
the
crowd
in
the
meadow
around
him
but
by
the
astonishing
change
that
had
come
over
the
landscape
it
was
as
if
some
devastating
disease
had
struck
all
the
growing
things
of
the
region
from
the
tallest
trees
to
the
very
blades
of
grass
the
leafless
groves
raised
black
skeletal
arms
up
to
the
bright
blue
sky
like
men
praying
the
vineyards
on
the
slopes
were
gray
clumps
of
shrubbery
the
meadow
grass
on
which
he
stood
was
yellow
and
brittle
it
broke
to
bits
underfoot
he
had
known
of
course
that
such
changes
came
over
the
european
landscape
each
winter
but
to
see
such
desolation
with
his
own
eyes
was
more
amazing
even
frightening
than
he
realized
it
would
be
soon
the
christians
would
be
celebrating
the
birth
of
jesus
the
messiah
whom
they
believed
was
god
seeing
death
in
the
landscape
all
around
him
daoud
found
it
easier
to
understand
why
these
idolators
might
feel
driven
to
worship
a
god
who
rose
from
the
dead
he
hoped
it
would
help
his
mission
that
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
for
the
miracle
at
bolsena
had
swept
everyone
in
orvieto
from
the
pope
on
down
he
hoped
they
would
have
neither
time
to
think
about
the
tartars
nor
interest
in
dealing
with
them
but
this
miracle
and
all
the
talk
about
it
made
him
uneasy
the
frenzy
in
the
christian
faces
around
him
might
be
turned
he
thought
in
any
direction
it
must
be
the
same
frenzy
that
had
driven
generations
of
crusaders
to
hurl
themselves
against
the
dar
fra
tomasso
was
at
the
very
center
of
the
furor
it
was
he
who
had
sent
word
from
bolsena
that
in
his
judgment
the
miracle
was
indeed
authentic
might
this
new
preoccupation
distract
him
from
his
efforts
to
prevent
the
alliance
and
there
was
something
else
something
that
revived
a
terror
buried
deep
in
daoud
soul
jesus
the
crucified
god
of
the
christians
stirred
in
this
miracle
as
a
boy
growing
up
among
muslims
daoud
had
renounced
belief
in
the
crucifixion
and
resurrection
of
jesus
now
he
felt
again
his
father
ghostly
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
the
hairs
lifted
on
the
back
of
his
neck
look
at
the
sick
people
and
the
cripples
lining
the
road
said
lorenzo
i
would
not
have
thought
there
could
be
that
many
infirm
people
in
orvieto
he
and
daoud
stood
side
by
side
at
a
spot
where
the
road
between
bolsena
and
orvieto
passed
through
a
wide
valley
their
horses
tethered
in
a
nearby
grove
of
poplar
trees
they
had
moved
back
a
few
paces
from
the
edge
of
the
road
to
make
room
for
a
dozen
men
and
women
on
stretchers
wrapped
in
blankets
who
had
been
carried
here
by
franciscan
friars
from
their
hospital
all
around
lorenzo
and
daoud
stood
cardinal
ugolini
servants
and
maids
ugolini
entire
household
was
here
except
for
the
few
of
highest
rank
who
would
march
with
the
cardinal
who
marched
behind
the
pope
fearing
that
scipio
would
go
uncared
for
lorenzo
had
brought
him
along
holding
him
on
a
thick
leather
leash
the
gray
boarhound
paced
nervously
and
growled
from
time
to
time
in
the
meadow
across
the
road
the
pope
servants
had
erected
a
pavilion
without
walls
just
a
roof
of
silk
gold
and
white
the
papal
colors
coming
to
three
points
held
up
by
a
dozen
or
more
stout
poles
there
pope
urban
would
say
mass
after
receiving
the
sanctified
cloth
daoud
glanced
down
the
road
to
where
sophia
stood
they
had
agreed
that
in
public
it
would
be
best
for
them
to
appear
far
apart
from
each
other
she
was
dressed
as
any
italian
woman
might
be
her
hair
covered
with
a
round
flat
linen
cap
bound
under
her
chin
a
chemise
with
long
tight
sleeves
and
a
sleeveless
gown
of
light
blue
silk
over
it
beside
sophia
stood
a
slighter
figure
in
gray
veil
and
gown
they
had
their
heads
close
together
talking
who
is
that
with
sophia
daoud
asked
lorenzo
oh
rachel
i
think
lorenzo
studiously
examined
scipio
head
for
fleas
she
appears
in
public
with
rachel
daoud
said
angrily
lorenzo
shrugged
no
one
knows
who
rachel
is
he
slapped
rump
sit
i
did
not
like
sophia
visiting
rachel
daoud
said
even
less
do
i
like
their
being
seen
together
in
public
trumpets
shrilled
and
drums
sounded
as
the
hymn
came
to
an
end
daoud
looked
toward
orvieto
the
road
that
wound
down
past
the
folds
of
tufa
was
filled
with
people
at
the
head
of
the
procession
walked
the
pope
in
gold
and
white
and
the
cardinals
of
the
sacred
college
in
bright
red
the
middle
of
the
long
line
was
bright
with
the
purples
of
archbishops
and
bishops
and
the
variegated
raiment
of
the
nobility
the
rear
was
dark
with
the
grays
and
browns
of
common
folk
from
this
distance
daoud
could
not
see
pope
urban
face
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
mitre
with
its
glittering
triple
crown
lucky
for
the
pope
the
weather
was
cold
thought
daoud
wearing
those
heavy
vestments
on
a
hot
day
would
surely
kill
the
old
man
that
today
he
chose
to
go
on
foot
showed
how
much
this
miracle
meant
to
him
daoud
turned
and
looked
to
the
west
the
marchers
from
bolsena
were
close
and
people
were
falling
to
their
knees
all
over
the
meadow
will
have
to
kneel
too
and
seem
to
worship
their
idols
forgive
me
daoud
saw
sophia
and
rachel
drop
to
their
knees
they
think
as
little
of
this
as
i
coming
toward
daoud
from
the
west
was
a
great
banner
that
offended
his
every
religious
feeling
painted
on
the
red
cloth
were
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
bearded
man
jesus
the
messiah
with
huge
staring
eyes
on
his
head
was
a
plaited
wreath
of
thorns
and
behind
it
a
disk
of
gold
from
the
nail
holes
that
pierced
his
upraised
palms
fell
painted
drops
of
blood
an
idol
such
as
the
koran
forbade
and
the
prophet
had
come
into
this
world
to
destroy
and
then
he
thought
of
the
great
crucifix
that
hung
in
the
chapel
of
château
langmuir
outside
ascalon
and
his
mother
taking
him
by
the
hand
to
pray
before
it
because
lived
and
died
here
he
remembered
her
sweet
voice
saying
that
is
why
we
are
here
in
this
holy
land
he
felt
momentarily
dizzy
they
his
mother
and
father
and
all
these
people
here
thought
that
the
bearded
man
with
the
wounds
of
crucifixion
in
his
hands
was
god
and
he
had
believed
it
once
too
no
god
was
one
he
could
not
be
a
father
who
reigned
in
heaven
and
a
son
who
came
down
to
earth
god
was
glorious
and
he
could
not
be
crucified
god
was
the
creator
he
could
not
be
part
of
his
creation
and
yet
the
cold
hand
still
lay
upon
his
shoulder
a
gentle
hand
but
it
frightened
him
all
around
daoud
the
infidels
were
throwing
themselves
on
their
knees
even
on
their
faces
in
the
road
before
the
advancing
banner
a
man
in
a
black
robe
was
walking
before
the
banner
bearer
despite
his
long
gray
beard
there
was
something
about
his
staring
eyes
and
wide
downturned
mouth
that
reminded
daoud
of
a
fish
the
bearded
priest
father
kyril
was
holding
up
by
its
corners
a
white
square
of
linen
that
thought
daoud
must
be
the
altar
cloth
on
which
the
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
from
the
wafer
of
bread
as
he
walked
he
slowly
solemnly
turned
from
side
to
side
to
allow
people
on
both
sides
of
the
road
to
see
the
cloth
david
for
god
sake
lorenzo
ground
out
beside
him
his
curiosity
had
made
him
forget
himself
he
dropped
to
his
knees
feeling
dry
grass
prick
his
skin
through
his
silk
hose
lorenzo
knelt
beside
him
gripping
the
dog
collar
the
sick
and
crippled
people
lying
beside
the
road
were
wailing
and
holding
up
their
arms
in
supplication
again
daoud
asked
god
forgiveness
for
his
seeming
idolatry
father
kyril
and
the
altar
cloth
were
only
a
dozen
paces
away
and
now
daoud
could
see
the
brown
bloodstains
on
the
white
cloth
amazingly
they
appeared
to
form
the
profile
of
a
bearded
man
as
a
cold
wind
against
his
spine
he
felt
his
fear
of
the
wrath
of
the
christian
god
the
big
hound
right
beside
him
let
out
a
thunderous
bark
daoud
started
with
surprise
his
heart
pounded
in
his
chest
scipio
barked
and
barked
so
loudly
daoud
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
father
kyril
took
a
step
backward
people
who
had
been
venerating
the
bloodstained
cloth
turned
with
angry
shouts
the
hands
of
the
escorting
father
kyril
twitched
groping
for
the
weapons
they
were
not
carrying
scipio
lorenzo
gave
the
hound
a
sharp
slap
on
the
side
of
the
head
the
dog
kept
up
its
barking
father
kyril
had
stopped
walking
and
looked
frightened
he
clutched
the
stained
cloth
to
his
breast
at
a
word
from
him
daoud
thought
the
crowd
would
tear
to
pieces
the
dog
lorenzo
and
perhaps
daoud
himself
lorenzo
grabbed
scipio
muzzle
with
both
hands
forcing
it
shut
scipio
kept
up
a
growling
through
his
teeth
lorenzo
growled
back
be
still
he
wrestled
the
dog
down
until
the
lean
gray
head
was
pressed
into
the
grass
barking
is
the
only
way
he
knows
to
greet
the
savior
said
lorenzo
with
an
ingratiating
grin
looking
up
at
the
people
glaring
at
him
there
could
be
a
devil
in
that
dog
a
friar
said
ominously
but
scipio
relaxed
under
lorenzo
hands
and
those
around
daoud
and
lorenzo
turned
back
to
the
procession
daoud
was
furious
lorenzo
damned
dog
had
been
like
a
stone
in
his
shoe
ever
since
they
set
out
from
lucera
lorenzo
was
a
valuable
man
but
he
insisted
on
attaching
others
to
him
who
caused
endless
trouble
like
the
dog
like
rachel
a
scream
rose
above
the
music
so
shrill
daoud
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
again
my
god
i
can
see
a
woman
was
standing
clasping
her
hands
together
and
flinging
them
wide
again
and
again
one
of
the
franciscans
threw
his
arms
around
her
whether
to
rejoice
with
her
or
restrain
her
daoud
could
not
tell
but
she
pushed
him
away
and
went
stumbling
after
father
kyril
from
the
way
her
hands
pawed
the
air
daoud
suspected
she
could
not
see
very
well
but
she
shouted
with
joy
all
the
same
she
joined
a
crowd
of
people
many
of
them
waving
walking
sticks
and
crutches
others
with
bloodstained
bandages
trailing
from
their
hands
one
man
daoud
saw
to
his
horror
was
missing
a
foot
and
was
limping
along
in
the
dirt
road
without
the
aid
of
crutch
or
cane
on
one
whole
leg
and
one
stump
bound
with
a
dirty
cloth
that
ended
at
the
ankle
his
face
was
red
and
blindly
ecstatic
behind
the
rejoicing
invalids
walked
rows
of
clergymen
from
bolsena
daoud
recognized
a
familiar
figure
in
the
foreground
fra
tomasso
his
cheeks
crimson
with
cold
and
exertion
his
black
mantle
blowing
in
the
wind
he
had
spent
the
last
two
weeks
daoud
knew
in
bolsena
investigating
the
miracle
and
overseeing
preparations
for
the
altar
cloth
to
be
brought
to
pope
urban
what
did
he
think
now
daoud
ached
to
know
would
he
still
work
as
hard
to
defeat
the
tartar
alliance
did
this
miracle
mean
daoud
had
gained
ground
or
lost
ground
a
sudden
silence
fell
over
the
meadow
pope
urban
with
trembling
hands
upraised
approached
father
kyril
whose
back
was
to
daoud
father
kyril
went
down
on
his
knees
before
the
pope
holding
up
the
white
cloth
over
his
head
like
a
banner
then
the
pope
also
knelt
somewhat
shakily
with
the
assistance
of
two
young
priests
in
white
surplices
and
black
cassocks
urban
reached
up
for
the
cloth
and
pulled
it
down
to
his
face
and
kissed
it
is
seeing
that
cloth
for
the
first
time
and
yet
he
seems
to
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
looking
at
the
blood
of
his
god
that
daoud
felt
a
chill
that
was
colder
than
the
december
air
daoud
pushed
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
open
pavilion
where
the
pope
assisted
by
father
kyril
and
fra
tomasso
was
saying
high
mass
a
band
of
musicians
blew
on
hautboys
and
clarions
sawed
at
vielles
stroked
harps
and
thumped
on
drums
the
white
cloth
with
its
strange
stain
was
stretched
on
a
gilded
frame
above
the
altar
daoud
felt
uneasy
whenever
he
looked
at
it
just
when
it
seemed
he
had
found
the
key
to
wrecking
the
union
of
tartars
and
crusaders
a
miracle
what
did
it
portend
memory
showed
him
his
mother
and
father
celebrating
easter
standing
hand
in
hand
before
the
altar
at
château
langmuir
receiving
holy
communion
the
sacred
host
from
their
chaplain
when
he
was
old
enough
his
mother
had
told
him
he
too
would
be
allowed
to
take
jesus
into
his
heart
by
swallowing
the
communion
wafer
what
a
strange
belief
but
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
beautiful
bear
witness
that
god
is
one
that
muhammad
is
the
messenger
of
god
he
glanced
around
the
pavilion
and
saw
many
faces
he
had
come
to
know
in
the
last
few
months
there
was
cardinal
de
verceuil
with
his
big
nose
and
small
mouth
there
was
ugolini
the
size
of
a
child
dressed
up
as
a
cardinal
blinking
rapidly
looking
rather
bored
in
the
front
row
of
standing
worshipers
were
john
and
philip
the
tartars
in
silk
robes
beside
them
friar
mathieu
the
franciscan
cleverest
of
opponents
daoud
gauged
him
to
be
a
genuinely
holy
man
if
an
infidel
could
be
called
holy
and
next
to
him
was
the
pale
young
face
of
the
count
de
gobignon
as
daoud
looked
at
him
de
gobignon
looked
back
and
his
eyes
widened
slightly
day
count
you
will
die
by
my
the
mass
began
and
even
though
there
must
have
been
five
thousand
people
in
the
valley
there
was
complete
silence
the
quiet
was
eerie
at
a
muslim
religious
celebration
this
large
the
crowd
would
be
chanting
in
unison
there
would
be
music
dervishes
singing
and
dancing
impromptu
sermons
would
be
delivered
in
various
parts
of
the
crowd
by
mullahs
or
by
ordinary
men
moved
to
speak
here
all
was
focused
on
the
center
pope
urban
rose
to
speak
he
had
removed
his
mitre
to
say
mass
his
white
hair
his
long
beard
and
his
trailing
mustache
seemed
much
more
sparse
than
they
had
been
when
daoud
had
first
seen
the
pope
last
summer
his
face
was
as
pale
as
his
hair
and
his
hands
trembled
a
few
months
ago
daoud
had
heard
urban
voice
rise
robustly
from
the
center
of
his
body
today
his
voice
was
high
and
thin
and
seemed
to
come
from
his
throat
he
told
the
story
of
the
miracle
of
bolsena
and
explained
that
father
kyril
was
a
priest
from
bohemia
who
had
developed
doubts
about
whether
christ
was
really
present
in
each
and
every
consecrated
communion
wafer
could
a
small
piece
of
bread
really
become
the
body
of
jesus
when
a
priest
said
a
few
words
over
it
is
the
illness
daoud
eye
told
him
it
was
deep
within
pope
urban
it
had
sunk
its
claws
into
his
chest
do
not
think
this
pope
has
long
to
ugolini
had
told
daoud
that
urban
wanted
desperately
before
he
himself
died
to
strike
a
death
blow
against
the
hohenstaufen
family
he
wanted
count
charles
brother
of
the
king
of
france
to
wrest
the
crown
of
sicily
from
manfred
but
king
louis
had
thus
far
forbidden
his
brother
to
make
war
on
manfred
king
louis
wanted
a
different
war
a
joint
war
of
christians
and
tartars
against
islam
thus
far
the
pope
had
withheld
his
approval
of
any
christian
monarch
allying
himself
with
the
tartars
as
urban
heard
the
approaching
wings
of
the
angel
of
death
might
he
be
more
inclined
to
grant
louis
what
he
wanted
the
crowd
was
no
longer
silent
daoud
heard
waves
of
murmuring
run
through
it
as
people
relayed
the
pope
words
to
those
who
were
too
far
away
to
hear
him
he
noticed
now
the
hawklike
profile
of
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
she
was
seated
in
a
chair
in
front
of
the
worshipers
on
the
side
of
the
pavilion
opposite
daoud
a
plump
young
boy
in
red
velvet
stood
beside
her
seeing
her
daoud
looked
for
marco
di
filippeschi
he
could
not
be
sure
but
the
back
of
a
dark
head
on
this
side
of
the
pavilion
looked
like
that
of
the
filippeschi
chieftain
those
organizing
this
ceremony
would
of
course
be
careful
to
separate
the
leaders
of
the
two
feuding
families
pope
urban
continued
father
kyril
realizing
that
he
was
doomed
to
eternal
damnation
if
he
did
not
overcome
his
doubts
had
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
but
rome
had
fallen
on
evil
days
its
streets
turned
into
battlefields
by
the
ghibellini
followers
of
the
vile
hohenstaufens
and
father
kyril
found
no
peace
there
he
decided
to
ask
the
prayers
of
the
pope
himself
at
orvieto
that
decision
was
rewarded
before
he
even
reached
here
two
months
ago
while
saying
mass
at
bolsena
on
his
way
to
orvieto
and
praying
that
his
doubts
be
resolved
father
kyril
raised
the
sacred
host
over
his
head
after
the
consecration
and
hundreds
of
witnesses
saw
drops
of
blood
fall
from
it
to
the
cloth
spread
on
the
altar
and
now
pope
urban
gestured
to
the
cloth
spread
above
the
altar
we
can
behold
with
our
own
eyes
the
blood
of
christ
himself
and
see
this
proof
which
having
faith
we
should
not
need
to
see
that
jesus
lives
in
the
blessed
sacrament
we
propose
to
offer
triple
thanks
to
god
for
his
generosity
in
granting
us
this
miracle
said
pope
urban
first
let
the
day
on
which
father
kyril
saw
the
host
bleed
be
celebrated
henceforward
as
the
feast
of
the
body
of
christ
corpus
christi
let
this
be
proclaimed
throughout
christendom
second
to
house
and
display
this
most
sacred
relic
the
blood
of
our
savior
himself
let
a
great
and
beautiful
new
cathedral
be
built
here
at
orvieto
which
will
forever
be
the
center
for
the
veneration
of
the
body
of
christ
daoud
sighed
inwardly
at
the
thought
of
still
another
great
building
dedicated
to
idolatry
yet
the
chapel
at
château
langmuir
had
been
such
a
lovely
and
quiet
place
as
the
pontiff
words
were
repeated
the
murmuring
grew
louder
someone
near
daoud
said
but
the
miracle
happened
in
bolsena
someone
else
hushed
the
person
who
protested
should
not
wonder
if
these
cities
went
to
war
with
each
other
over
such
a
thought
daoud
finally
said
pope
urban
oblivious
of
the
discontent
his
previous
proclamation
had
caused
among
the
citizens
of
bolsena
we
command
that
all
priests
of
holy
church
shall
read
a
special
office
on
the
feast
of
corpus
christi
of
each
year
commemorating
this
miracle
god
has
willed
that
there
should
be
dwelling
with
us
here
at
orvieto
the
most
gifted
scholar
and
writer
of
this
age
fra
tomasso
daoud
saw
that
fra
tomasso
face
was
almost
as
bright
a
red
as
a
cardinal
hat
and
we
charge
our
beloved
and
most
gloriously
gifted
son
fra
tomasso
with
the
duty
of
writing
this
office
rose
heavily
from
a
bench
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
puffing
sweating
despite
the
chill
of
the
day
he
bowed
to
the
pope
with
hands
clasped
before
him
great
honor
that
must
daoud
thought
fra
tomasso
was
silent
for
the
moment
but
he
would
write
words
that
would
be
repeated
by
thousands
of
priests
all
over
the
world
as
long
as
christians
celebrated
this
feast
was
more
than
ever
indebted
to
the
pope
if
the
pope
were
to
want
help
in
persuading
the
french
to
go
to
war
against
manfred
he
would
collect
that
debt
looking
at
fra
tomasso
as
he
sat
listening
to
pope
urban
talk
on
about
his
plans
for
the
feast
for
the
cathedral
for
the
office
daoud
saw
a
glow
on
those
rounded
features
that
made
him
uneasy
daoud
had
felt
that
with
cardinal
ugolini
and
fra
tomasso
stirring
up
opposition
to
the
alliance
throughout
christendom
he
had
but
to
wait
for
the
plan
to
die
of
old
age
he
could
no
longer
be
sure
of
that
fra
tomasso
opposition
to
the
alliance
had
a
fragile
basis
at
best
and
this
miracle
might
have
shattered
it
the
blood
of
the
messiah
had
power
to
change
the
course
of
events
daoud
felt
himself
trembling
xl
daoud
hands
were
cold
and
his
heart
was
racing
he
had
been
waiting
all
morning
for
ugolini
to
come
back
from
the
dominican
convent
he
sat
at
ugolini
worktable
trying
to
read
he
had
found
an
old
book
in
arabic
in
ugolini
library
the
of
ibn
zaina
a
book
saadi
had
often
praised
at
another
time
he
would
have
devoured
it
but
his
mind
refused
to
follow
the
words
sending
ugolini
to
fra
tomasso
was
his
final
effort
to
learn
what
had
gone
wrong
and
to
see
what
might
be
saved
what
would
fra
tomasso
say
to
ugolini
at
least
ugolini
could
be
trusted
not
to
make
things
worse
as
de
verceuil
had
for
their
opponents
this
was
the
christian
month
of
february
and
the
chill
that
pervaded
daoud
body
came
from
the
air
around
him
as
well
as
from
his
troubled
spirit
the
small
wood
fire
that
burned
on
the
hearth
beside
the
table
did
little
to
dispel
the
cold
in
the
room
in
the
two
months
that
followed
the
coming
of
the
bloodstained
altar
cloth
to
orvieto
tomasso
had
gradually
but
completely
reversed
himself
according
to
a
dominican
in
ugolini
pay
the
philosopher
had
sent
new
letters
to
the
european
kings
confessing
that
his
opposition
to
an
alliance
between
christians
and
tartars
had
been
an
error
at
least
three
italian
cardinals
had
told
ugolini
that
fra
tomasso
had
come
to
them
personally
with
the
same
message
cardinal
gratiano
marchetti
whispered
that
pope
urban
who
did
not
expect
to
live
through
the
winter
had
promised
the
stout
friar
a
voice
in
the
election
of
the
next
pope
where
urban
had
been
neutral
toward
the
alliance
perhaps
even
opposed
something
now
caused
him
to
favor
it
just
as
the
tumbling
of
a
single
grain
of
sand
could
bring
a
whole
dune
crashing
down
to
bury
a
caravan
so
those
drops
of
blood
at
bolsena
had
been
the
start
of
an
avalanche
of
reversals
daoud
awaited
ugolini
coming
and
the
message
he
bore
as
a
man
accused
of
a
capital
crime
awaits
the
verdict
of
his
judge
and
if
it
was
true
that
fra
tomasso
had
irrevocably
turned
against
them
daoud
must
begin
all
over
again
with
a
new
plan
to
stop
the
alliance
the
fire
gave
off
the
sour
odor
of
strange
substances
ugolini
had
previously
burned
on
the
hearth
daoud
pushed
himself
out
of
the
cardinal
chair
and
went
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
he
opened
the
casement
window
and
saw
ugolini
sedan
chair
borne
by
four
servants
turning
in
toward
the
door
of
the
mansion
the
cardinal
chair
passed
the
shop
across
the
street
where
rows
of
large
and
small
pots
brightly
painted
with
floral
designs
were
laid
out
on
a
large
blanket
the
potter
and
his
wife
bundled
up
in
heavy
cloaks
were
calling
out
for
the
cardinal
blessing
daoud
saw
a
tiny
hand
emerge
from
the
curtains
of
the
sedan
chair
closed
against
the
february
cold
the
hand
shaped
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
the
air
as
the
shopkeepers
fell
to
their
knees
daoud
wondered
whether
the
potter
and
his
wife
felt
they
had
an
unlucky
spot
to
offer
their
wares
that
was
where
last
august
de
archers
had
shot
down
two
men
in
the
crowd
when
the
tartars
were
entering
the
city
and
it
was
in
front
of
that
shop
shuttered
then
for
the
night
that
alain
de
pirenne
body
had
been
found
had
the
shopkeeper
or
his
wife
seen
anything
and
were
they
keeping
silent
only
out
of
fear
months
had
gone
by
but
the
podesta
was
still
investigating
the
killing
questioning
and
requestioning
everyone
who
might
know
something
about
it
daoud
paced
the
room
anxiously
until
ugolini
came
in
throwing
his
cape
and
his
red
hat
to
a
servant
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
daoud
had
been
using
daoud
closed
the
door
as
a
man
dying
of
thirst
begs
for
water
daoud
prayed
for
good
news
but
ugolini
pale
face
haggard
eyes
and
downturned
mouth
told
a
different
tale
daoud
heart
plunged
into
despair
has
he
turned
against
us
he
hated
the
note
of
pleading
he
heard
in
his
voice
ugolini
went
to
his
worktable
sighed
and
sat
down
heavily
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
crossed
staring
down
his
pointed
nose
at
the
painted
skull
that
grinned
back
at
him
his
restless
fingers
found
the
dioptra
lying
on
the
table
and
he
started
to
roll
the
brass
tube
in
his
hand
i
used
every
argument
i
could
think
of
he
said
i
even
repeated
back
to
him
the
arguments
he
used
in
the
letters
and
sermons
he
wrote
against
the
tartars
arguing
with
fra
tomasso
is
like
trying
wrestle
a
djinn
daoud
said
i
admire
your
courage
in
even
trying
ugolini
raised
a
finger
i
thought
i
was
getting
somewhere
with
him
he
kept
trying
to
change
the
subject
he
kept
asking
me
if
the
earth
moves
while
the
sun
stands
still
he
seems
to
be
convinced
that
is
what
happens
then
what
path
does
the
earth
follow
i
told
him
that
the
greeks
he
stopped
and
stared
at
daoud
oh
never
mind
the
greeks
the
point
is
he
was
mocking
me
mocking
you
yes
talking
about
the
heavenly
bodies
he
was
referring
to
that
scroll
you
gave
me
to
present
to
him
that
work
of
aristotle
what
a
waste
giving
that
to
him
what
would
i
not
give
to
have
it
myself
why
did
he
keep
changing
the
subject
did
he
never
tell
you
where
he
stands
on
the
alliance
ugolini
closed
his
eyes
and
nodded
yes
finally
he
said
he
made
a
grave
mistake
opposing
the
alliance
he
said
that
if
christians
do
not
seize
this
chance
the
tartars
may
be
converted
to
the
religion
of
mohammed
as
those
in
russia
already
have
been
which
would
be
the
worst
of
all
possible
disasters
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
daoud
we
have
lost
him
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
to
change
his
mind
i
truly
believe
it
is
hopeless
hearing
those
words
daoud
felt
drained
he
sagged
against
the
wall
of
ugolini
cabinet
wanting
to
sit
on
the
floor
but
unable
to
do
so
because
then
he
could
not
see
the
cardinal
it
is
urban
who
has
done
this
to
us
said
ugolini
he
must
have
decided
that
supporting
the
alliance
is
the
only
way
he
can
get
french
help
against
king
manfred
he
tempted
fra
tomasso
with
something
far
more
valuable
to
him
than
an
old
scroll
he
offered
him
greater
glory
and
power
in
the
church
the
angel
of
death
thought
daoud
had
done
it
feeling
himself
mortally
ill
the
pope
had
realized
he
could
no
longer
bargain
with
the
king
of
france
on
an
equal
basis
he
would
have
to
offer
louis
what
he
wanted
permission
to
ally
himself
with
the
tartars
will
the
pope
now
support
the
alliance
openly
if
daoud
chose
to
fight
he
thought
he
would
have
to
strike
hard
and
fast
he
would
have
to
strike
at
the
tartars
despite
the
downward
turn
of
his
fortunes
daoud
felt
a
strange
lightness
of
heart
as
he
considered
the
prospect
he
had
tried
every
other
way
of
preventing
tartars
and
christians
from
forming
an
alliance
persuasion
bribery
the
spreading
of
lies
now
he
could
turn
to
the
way
he
was
best
at
war
urban
will
not
come
out
for
the
alliance
at
once
said
ugolini
before
bolsena
fra
tomasso
and
my
italian
colleagues
in
the
sacred
college
stirred
up
so
much
feeling
against
the
tartars
that
urban
would
lose
support
all
over
europe
if
he
were
to
call
now
for
a
pact
between
christians
and
tartars
so
he
must
move
slowly
with
fra
tomasso
now
working
with
him
winning
approval
for
the
alliance
what
if
the
french
sent
an
army
to
him
now
daoud
asked
ugolini
laughed
do
you
think
king
louis
of
france
can
sow
teeth
and
have
an
army
spring
up
in
his
fields
overnight
he
would
have
to
summon
the
great
barons
of
france
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
they
support
his
cause
then
assemble
the
lesser
barons
and
knights
supplies
must
be
gathered
money
found
to
pay
the
knights
and
it
can
take
years
to
raise
an
army
big
enough
to
wage
a
war
mamelukes
would
be
ready
to
ride
in
a
had
the
crusaders
managed
to
make
any
inroads
at
all
in
the
dar
if
the
pope
is
not
ready
to
declare
for
the
alliance
there
is
time
said
daoud
nothing
is
settled
yet
time
for
what
what
will
you
do
now
he
pushed
himself
away
from
the
wall
went
to
a
mullioned
window
and
pulled
open
one
of
the
casements
to
the
northwest
a
tower
of
orange
brick
with
square
battlements
looked
arrogantly
down
upon
the
huddled
masses
of
peaked
red
roofs
from
the
tower
fluttered
the
orange
and
green
banner
of
the
monaldeschi
there
the
tartars
were
he
turned
from
the
window
and
moved
slowly
toward
ugolini
table
i
am
sorry
he
said
as
gently
as
he
could
this
is
not
ended
ugolini
had
been
playing
with
the
dioptra
he
dropped
it
with
a
clank
what
do
you
mean
fear
made
his
voice
shrill
and
quavering
i
mean
i
must
attack
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
attack
the
monaldeschi
it
was
almost
a
scream
daoud
spread
his
hands
i
have
no
choice
ugolini
sprang
to
his
feet
pazzia
you
are
mad
is
you
who
are
almost
mad
with
daoud
thought
he
was
going
to
have
trouble
with
ugolini
no
question
aloud
he
said
only
we
will
discuss
it
you
can
help
us
plan
pardon
me
your
eminence
while
i
send
for
lorenzo
it
will
have
to
be
late
at
night
of
course
said
lorenzo
and
i
would
think
a
friday
evening
would
be
best
when
the
will
be
off
their
guard
and
many
of
them
out
carousing
but
it
finally
depends
on
when
marco
di
filippeschi
says
his
family
men
can
be
ready
they
need
to
buy
weapons
daoud
and
lorenzo
stood
by
the
cardinal
table
while
ugolini
paced
with
many
short
steps
between
the
windows
and
the
hearth
he
muttered
to
himself
and
his
hands
trembled
as
he
ran
them
through
his
tufts
of
white
hair
what
of
our
men
said
daoud
we
have
over
two
hundred
now
scattered
throughout
the
city
said
lorenzo
i
could
be
in
the
palazzo
before
the
fighting
begins
ugolini
stopped
his
pacing
and
faced
them
you
talk
like
moonstruck
men
you
would
unleash
a
civil
war
right
here
in
orvieto
not
us
your
eminence
said
lorenzo
have
not
these
two
families
been
fighting
for
generations
what
is
your
objection
said
daoud
gently
ugolini
fixed
them
with
a
ferocious
glare
for
six
months
half
a
year
i
have
lain
awake
imagining
arrest
disgrace
torture
execution
through
miracles
you
have
managed
to
carry
out
your
plans
without
being
caught
now
you
want
to
launch
still
wilder
plans
incredible
fantastic
things
i
have
had
enough
god
has
kept
me
alive
this
long
i
will
not
tempt
him
further
my
dear
cardinal
daoud
said
once
the
tartars
are
dead
this
will
all
be
over
i
will
go
back
to
egypt
lorenzo
and
sophia
will
return
to
manfred
kingdom
you
will
have
nothing
further
to
fear
you
could
have
tried
to
kill
the
tartars
at
any
time
since
they
came
here
said
ugolini
why
now
i
needed
to
create
as
much
ill
will
as
possible
between
christians
and
tartars
said
daoud
if
i
had
killed
the
tartars
at
once
i
could
not
have
had
them
discredit
themselves
out
of
their
own
mouths
fra
tomasso
and
your
colleagues
among
the
italian
cardinals
could
not
have
stirred
up
so
much
fear
and
hatred
toward
them
now
though
i
have
done
all
i
can
along
those
lines
and
fra
tomasso
is
already
undoing
what
together
we
have
accomplished
and
why
involve
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
ugolini
pressed
him
to
make
it
seem
that
the
tartars
have
been
killed
by
feuding
italians
then
hulagu
khan
will
think
again
about
whether
he
wants
such
people
as
his
allies
ugolini
shook
his
head
i
do
not
have
to
tell
you
of
all
people
what
war
is
like
and
i
think
messer
lorenzo
by
the
way
he
carries
himself
has
known
battle
more
than
once
you
both
know
that
chance
rules
every
moment
in
war
true
said
daoud
and
if
chance
decided
against
them
for
a
moment
he
saw
sophia
naked
being
torn
apart
by
the
torturers
pincers
he
almost
shuddered
and
had
to
hold
himself
rigid
i
take
it
you
intend
to
be
part
of
this
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
ugolini
went
on
i
do
said
daoud
ugolini
threw
up
his
hands
as
if
daoud
had
already
proved
his
case
for
him
well
then
what
if
someone
recognizes
you
attacking
the
palace
i
will
not
openly
lead
i
will
enter
the
palace
and
kill
the
tartars
so
said
ugolini
you
will
not
just
be
somewhere
in
the
street
outside
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
you
will
be
the
in
the
midst
of
all
your
enemies
alone
attempting
to
assassinate
the
tartars
tell
me
does
that
sound
like
the
plan
of
a
reasonable
cautious
man
to
you
daoud
thought
it
sounded
as
if
he
were
to
put
it
as
ugolini
had
tempting
god
but
ugolini
did
not
understand
that
daoud
had
not
only
the
skills
of
mameluke
but
had
also
received
the
secret
training
of
the
hashishiyya
fighters
the
fedawi
whose
powers
many
in
the
lands
of
islam
thought
magical
i
will
be
masked
i
will
be
dressed
in
garments
that
will
make
it
almost
impossible
to
see
me
i
will
not
expose
myself
i
will
move
in
darkness
i
have
been
trained
to
find
my
way
in
darkness
as
surely
as
if
it
were
sunlight
ugolini
shook
his
head
understand
me
i
would
not
go
on
arguing
with
you
like
this
did
i
not
feel
i
am
arguing
for
my
life
and
tilia
and
the
lives
of
those
who
depend
on
you
you
must
admit
that
you
might
be
captured
or
killed
my
house
guest
found
trying
to
murder
the
tartar
ambassadors
daoud
spread
his
hands
you
would
then
denounce
me
you
say
you
never
knew
what
a
demon
you
had
taken
into
your
home
ugolini
laughed
loudly
and
bitterly
are
our
opponents
fools
do
you
really
think
they
would
believe
me
even
for
a
moment
after
perhaps
hundreds
of
people
have
been
killed
after
a
civil
war
in
orvieto
anyone
who
is
even
suspect
will
die
the
monaldeschi
the
french
the
church
authorities
all
will
take
their
revenge
surely
you
understand
that
daoud
heart
grew
cold
as
he
looked
along
the
road
ugolini
was
describing
and
saw
defeat
massacre
the
hideous
deaths
of
his
comrades
and
beyond
that
iron
waves
of
crusaders
and
endless
columns
of
tartar
horsemen
sweeping
over
the
dar
and
he
could
not
look
into
ugolini
eyes
and
declare
that
all
would
turn
out
well
but
what
would
happen
if
he
did
nothing
he
looked
down
that
path
and
saw
the
same
masses
of
crusaders
and
tartars
saw
the
burning
mosques
the
emptied
cities
the
heaps
of
corpses
he
saw
the
gray
mosque
in
el
kahira
ruined
his
teacher
saadi
hacked
to
pieces
by
crusader
swords
then
he
heard
words
saadi
had
spoken
are
god
instruments
by
which
he
brings
about
that
which
he
wills
the
fool
does
nothing
and
leaves
the
outcome
to
god
the
ordinary
man
acts
and
prays
that
god
will
grant
a
good
result
the
wise
man
acts
and
leaves
the
outcome
to
he
would
act
he
turned
to
lorenzo
standing
near
him
by
the
cardinal
table
your
life
is
at
stake
in
this
what
do
you
think
lorenzo
face
was
as
grave
as
daoud
had
ever
seen
it
if
the
filippeschi
attack
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
they
will
be
driven
off
but
with
more
than
five
hundred
men
attacking
the
palace
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
french
to
guard
the
tartars
adequately
if
you
get
in
kill
them
and
get
out
safely
i
think
we
can
hide
our
part
in
the
fighting
if
you
are
caught
or
killed
i
think
it
is
as
the
cardinal
says
we
are
all
doomed
exactly
cried
ugolini
from
where
he
stood
behind
his
table
then
why
risk
it
because
we
must
lorenzo
said
to
him
if
we
do
not
stop
the
alliance
by
force
the
pope
will
strike
a
bargain
with
the
king
of
france
there
will
be
a
french
army
marching
against
my
king
manfred
and
after
that
crusaders
and
tartars
will
fall
upon
messer
david
people
ugolini
uttered
a
deep
groan
and
sank
into
his
chair
relief
swept
over
daoud
he
had
already
decided
to
make
the
attempt
on
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
even
if
lorenzo
opposed
it
but
to
have
lorenzo
side
with
him
gave
him
more
confidence
that
he
could
carry
it
off
lorenzo
turned
those
somber
eyes
to
him
again
it
all
depends
on
you
i
am
gambling
that
you
can
do
it
daoud
felt
a
powerful
warmth
toward
the
sicilian
there
were
times
when
he
had
wished
lorenzo
were
not
with
him
times
when
he
distrusted
him
the
foolishness
of
involving
them
with
rachel
and
her
husband
the
fact
that
lorenzo
was
a
jew
who
had
abandoned
his
religion
even
his
dog
was
a
nuisance
but
at
this
moment
to
have
lorenzo
support
made
him
feel
as
strong
and
confident
as
if
the
mameluke
orta
he
commanded
had
suddenly
appeared
in
orvieto
he
grinned
at
lorenzo
you
proved
how
good
a
gambler
you
are
by
losing
to
de
verceuil
lorenzo
chuckled
what
must
we
do
first
daoud
said
arrange
for
me
to
meet
secretly
with
marco
di
filippeschi
and
send
word
to
king
manfred
that
the
pope
and
the
french
are
about
to
reach
agreement
on
the
tartar
alliance
and
when
they
do
the
french
will
come
pouring
into
italy
tell
him
now
is
the
time
for
his
ghibellino
allies
in
the
north
to
march
on
orvieto
lorenzo
nodded
i
will
send
one
of
my
men
to
lucera
he
shook
his
head
my
god
how
i
wish
i
could
go
myself
once
the
tartars
are
dead
daoud
said
we
will
all
go
home
now
find
sordello
and
send
him
to
my
room
as
daoud
left
ugolini
cabinet
he
glanced
back
to
see
the
little
cardinal
slumped
over
the
table
knotting
his
fingers
in
his
fuzzy
white
hair
he
would
have
to
spend
more
time
with
him
to
build
up
his
courage
sophia
was
standing
in
the
hallway
when
daoud
emerged
from
his
room
that
night
on
his
way
to
meet
with
the
filippeschi
chieftain
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
her
someone
ugolini
or
lorenzo
would
have
told
her
about
his
new
plan
he
beckoned
her
into
his
room
and
closed
the
door
each
time
the
thought
of
defeat
arose
in
his
mind
he
had
felt
the
greatest
anguish
over
what
it
would
mean
for
sophia
that
forced
him
to
admit
to
himself
how
much
he
cared
for
her
now
that
he
looked
into
her
amber
eyes
and
told
her
what
he
intended
to
do
the
pain
he
felt
was
sharper
than
ever
he
wanted
to
persuade
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
but
he
knew
that
would
be
a
lie
he
tried
to
keep
what
he
said
simple
practical
you
like
sordello
will
bear
witness
that
lorenzo
and
i
had
gone
to
perugia
while
the
monaldeschi
palazzo
was
under
siege
lorenzo
has
allies
in
perugia
who
will
confirm
that
sophia
stared
at
him
with
wide
solemn
eyes
you
are
risking
everything
she
reached
out
and
seized
his
hand
gripping
it
urgently
if
they
find
out
who
you
are
while
you
are
in
the
monaldeschi
palace
it
will
be
the
end
for
all
of
us
he
felt
the
strength
in
her
fingers
the
softness
of
her
palm
and
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
he
held
himself
in
check
there
could
be
nothing
between
them
as
long
as
de
gobignon
was
alive
i
know
a
hundred
ways
to
get
into
a
castle
and
out
again
he
said
wishing
there
had
been
time
to
share
with
her
more
of
his
life
once
i
am
inside
i
will
search
out
and
kill
the
two
tartars
while
all
the
armed
men
are
occupied
with
the
fighting
outside
and
then
i
will
leave
he
spread
his
hands
to
show
how
easy
it
would
be
inwardly
he
was
ashamed
he
was
preparing
to
sacrifice
this
life
knowing
that
she
might
die
a
terrible
death
rape
torture
mutilation
public
execution
how
could
he
face
her
at
all
that
he
had
made
his
decision
in
order
to
save
hundreds
of
thousands
of
his
people
from
slaughter
his
faith
from
destruction
was
no
comfort
at
this
moment
alone
with
sophia
will
you
fight
simon
he
felt
his
blood
go
hot
that
she
should
think
at
all
of
de
gobignon
at
this
moment
rather
than
of
herself
or
of
him
made
him
so
angry
he
forgot
for
a
moment
his
own
guilt
and
fear
for
her
life
the
young
count
will
probably
be
leading
the
fight
on
the
battlements
daoud
tasted
the
venom
in
what
he
was
about
to
say
but
he
could
not
help
himself
it
will
be
quite
a
shock
when
he
finds
the
tartars
dead
and
realizes
how
he
has
failed
sophia
stood
breathing
hard
her
eyes
glistening
with
tears
if
only
you
were
not
daoud
was
already
wishing
he
had
not
spoken
so
to
her
not
what
not
blind
she
cried
she
turned
swiftly
and
reached
for
the
door
handle
but
daoud
could
not
let
her
go
he
was
there
before
her
and
he
faced
her
and
seized
her
hand
i
am
not
blind
he
rasped
i
see
that
pretending
to
be
what
you
are
not
is
tearing
you
apart
i
wish
we
could
be
our
true
selves
with
each
other
we
can
not
she
said
bitterly
and
to
speak
of
it
only
makes
it
hurt
more
let
me
go
he
relaxed
his
grip
on
her
hand
and
she
was
gone
he
thought
day
looking
at
the
closed
door
daoud
felt
an
almost
unbearable
inner
pain
he
had
thrust
her
at
simon
he
had
lashed
out
at
her
hurt
her
unjustly
having
done
that
to
her
he
was
about
to
put
her
in
far
worse
danger
how
could
he
claim
even
in
the
secrecy
of
his
own
heart
that
he
loved
her
daoud
could
barely
see
marco
di
filippeschi
in
the
darkness
moonlight
touched
the
gold
medallion
that
hung
from
marco
neck
and
on
the
silver
badge
in
his
cap
for
the
rest
he
was
a
figure
carved
out
of
shadow
despite
the
full
moon
this
narrow
alleyway
between
a
stone
house
and
the
city
wall
was
almost
as
black
as
the
bottom
of
a
well
daoud
senses
needed
no
light
to
see
by
he
had
learned
to
see
with
his
ears
as
well
as
with
his
sense
of
smell
he
could
sense
what
weapons
marco
di
filippeschi
was
wearing
a
shortsword
and
two
daggers
at
his
belt
and
from
the
difference
in
footfalls
a
third
dagger
in
a
sheath
in
his
right
boot
he
knew
the
position
of
marco
hands
and
he
knew
that
marco
had
told
the
truth
when
he
said
he
had
come
to
this
rendezvous
alone
lorenzo
had
assured
him
that
marco
would
leap
like
a
hungry
wolf
at
any
chance
to
avenge
himself
on
the
monaldeschi
but
daoud
wondered
would
the
volatile
young
clan
chieftain
really
be
willing
to
undertake
an
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
that
had
more
chance
of
failing
than
succeeding
i
can
offer
you
over
two
hundred
lusty
bravos
collected
by
one
who
is
known
to
you
daoud
said
hoping
to
make
marco
a
little
less
certain
about
who
his
ultimate
benefactor
was
he
avoided
naming
giancarlo
marco
could
destroy
daoud
and
all
his
comrades
by
revealing
the
identity
of
the
man
who
had
incited
his
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
if
he
were
captured
and
tortured
strong
and
fierce
though
he
might
be
it
was
likely
he
would
tell
everything
daoud
reached
into
the
purse
at
his
belt
where
he
had
earlier
put
two
emeralds
he
held
them
out
in
his
open
palm
so
that
the
moonlight
glistened
on
their
polished
surfaces
please
accept
these
as
a
gift
he
said
if
you
decide
to
assault
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
your
preparations
will
be
costly
the
jewels
must
be
called
a
gift
the
capo
della
famiglia
filippeschi
was
not
a
man
you
paid
to
do
your
work
for
you
marco
hand
closed
around
the
emeralds
and
his
other
hand
seized
daoud
forearm
i
shall
spend
this
on
weapons
he
said
crossbows
to
kill
more
monaldeschi
stone
guns
to
batter
down
their
walls
i
care
not
what
price
i
must
pay
is
thought
daoud
the
price
may
be
very
i
will
need
until
spring
marco
continued
it
will
take
that
long
to
buy
the
weapons
i
must
work
slowly
and
quietly
so
the
old
vulture
does
not
get
wind
of
what
i
am
doing
the
monaldeschi
are
collaborating
with
this
french
pope
and
his
french
cardinals
daoud
said
to
spur
marco
on
and
the
french
party
is
about
to
invite
an
army
under
charles
of
anjou
into
italy
damn
the
french
said
marco
and
damn
that
putana
and
her
family
for
working
with
them
also
as
everyone
knows
daoud
said
the
pope
has
not
long
to
live
strike
a
blow
now
for
italy
and
you
will
frighten
the
cardinals
at
a
time
when
they
will
soon
be
choosing
the
next
pope
so
your
attack
had
better
come
no
later
than
spring
we
filippeschi
are
as
loyal
to
the
papacy
as
the
monaldeschi
perhaps
more
my
master
whom
i
prefer
not
to
name
said
daoud
knowing
that
marco
would
think
he
meant
king
manfred
does
not
wish
to
see
the
pope
in
league
with
the
french
this
war
of
guelfi
and
ghibellini
leaves
us
prey
to
every
french
and
german
ladrone
who
wants
to
come
down
and
loot
our
country
said
marco
obviously
he
had
no
great
love
for
the
hohenstaufens
either
how
will
you
start
the
fighting
daoud
asked
him
two
or
three
of
my
cousins
will
take
a
walk
in
the
piazza
before
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
on
a
friday
evening
when
everybody
strolls
marco
said
if
their
mere
presence
in
that
part
of
the
city
does
not
cause
an
incident
they
will
step
on
a
few
toes
it
will
take
some
courage
to
go
into
the
lion
den
daoud
remarked
the
young
filippeschi
chieftain
laughed
ruefully
we
possess
more
of
courage
than
we
do
of
anything
else
if
they
did
not
also
possess
some
prudence
and
the
ability
to
keep
a
secret
daoud
thought
everything
was
lost
xli
the
stained
glass
in
the
cathedral
deeply
recessed
rear
windows
broke
the
sunlight
of
the
april
morning
into
blue
yellow
and
red
beams
walking
slowly
through
the
nave
simon
wondered
why
sordello
had
insisted
this
time
on
meeting
him
in
person
in
the
cathedral
rather
than
sending
his
news
through
ana
the
departure
from
their
routine
gave
simon
an
uneasy
feeling
that
some
disaster
was
about
to
befall
him
the
miraculous
altar
cloth
with
the
dark
spots
in
its
center
was
mounted
in
a
gilded
frame
above
the
altar
on
each
side
of
it
a
tall
white
candle
burned
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
two
priests
in
black
cassocks
and
white
surplices
knelt
on
benches
their
heads
resting
on
their
folded
arms
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
they
were
sleeping
or
praying
in
the
four
months
since
the
cloth
had
been
brought
to
orvieto
it
had
never
been
left
unattended
the
pope
had
decreed
that
priests
in
hourly
shifts
would
watch
day
and
night
before
the
blood
of
the
savior
simon
suspected
reverence
was
not
the
only
motive
for
this
vigil
he
knew
several
tales
of
famous
relics
being
stolen
not
only
from
pious
zeal
but
because
relics
attracted
pilgrims
and
their
money
and
the
people
of
bolsena
might
still
be
jealous
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
simon
approached
the
altar
genuflected
and
walked
into
the
shadows
on
the
left
side
of
the
cathedral
he
paused
by
a
fluted
pillar
that
rose
like
a
tree
trunk
approaching
him
was
a
beggar
in
a
tattered
gray
cloak
that
hung
to
his
ankles
a
deep
hood
hid
his
face
the
man
gripped
simon
arm
the
face
of
sordello
looked
out
of
the
shadows
under
the
hood
simon
pulled
his
arm
free
i
have
something
important
to
tell
your
signory
but
it
is
not
about
cardinal
ugolini
and
his
circle
sordello
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
filippeschi
are
going
to
make
a
surprise
attack
on
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
the
news
hit
simon
like
a
kick
in
the
belly
the
tartars
and
he
and
his
men
would
be
caught
in
the
middle
he
thought
back
to
alain
murder
even
since
then
he
had
felt
that
orvieto
could
be
a
death
trap
for
him
and
all
his
men
simon
leaned
forward
to
peer
into
sordello
pinkish
eyes
when
will
the
attack
come
tonight
after
vespers
now
simon
blood
froze
time
no
time
a
voice
shrieked
inside
him
he
wanted
to
run
back
to
the
palace
shouting
warnings
all
the
way
it
took
all
his
strength
to
keep
him
standing
with
sordello
to
force
his
mind
galloping
like
a
runaway
horse
to
slow
down
and
frame
questions
how
did
you
find
out
tavern
talk
some
of
giancarlo
hired
bravos
were
drinking
with
filippeschi
men
sweat
that
felt
like
a
cold
rain
broke
out
all
over
simon
body
the
tartars
he
must
get
them
out
of
the
monaldeschi
palace
but
the
contessa
had
been
his
hostess
for
many
months
he
himself
had
no
quarrel
with
the
filippeschi
but
he
had
an
obligation
to
defend
the
contessa
how
long
have
you
known
this
i
just
learned
it
last
night
but
they
must
have
been
preparing
for
months
why
sordello
eyes
met
his
the
filippeschi
think
the
monaldeschi
are
betraying
italy
to
you
french
if
the
filippeschi
were
attacking
now
because
he
was
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
then
indeed
he
had
a
quarrel
with
them
whether
or
not
he
wanted
one
and
it
was
his
fault
in
a
sense
that
the
contessa
was
in
danger
betraying
italy
to
the
french
what
does
that
mean
sordello
ticked
off
points
on
his
fingers
the
pope
is
french
he
asks
the
contessa
to
take
the
tartars
into
her
house
then
you
and
cardinal
de
verceuil
come
with
the
tartars
and
now
everyone
has
heard
that
the
pope
wants
charles
to
come
in
and
take
sicily
and
southern
italy
from
king
manfred
the
filippeschi
want
to
turn
the
tide
now
they
say
before
the
french
own
all
of
italy
the
face
of
uncle
charles
flashed
vividly
before
simon
mind
the
big
nose
the
staring
eyes
when
they
had
talked
of
this
mission
over
a
year
ago
at
the
louvre
he
had
said
nothing
of
sicily
had
spoken
only
of
the
liberation
of
jerusalem
and
the
destruction
of
islam
was
sicily
what
he
really
wanted
or
perhaps
even
all
of
italy
what
should
he
do
it
struck
simon
with
frightening
force
that
there
was
no
one
but
he
to
take
the
responsibility
he
was
in
command
he
must
make
the
plans
and
the
decisions
his
heart
thudded
frantically
and
he
prayed
that
sordello
could
not
see
the
consternation
that
filled
him
what
forces
do
they
have
what
weapons
sordello
shook
his
head
as
to
that
your
signory
i
know
very
little
i
have
been
at
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
not
among
the
filippeschi
i
would
guess
they
must
have
at
least
five
hundred
men
and
siege
weapons
they
would
be
mad
to
start
this
thing
with
less
five
hundred
men
and
siege
weapons
simon
pictured
the
monaldeschi
palace
with
its
great
tower
crumbling
under
a
bombardment
of
boulders
he
saw
men
swarming
over
it
like
ants
he
saw
the
defenders
lying
dead
in
the
ruins
de
puys
thierry
the
armenians
the
venetians
himself
he
saw
the
tartars
with
their
throats
cut
again
he
felt
the
urge
to
run
back
to
the
palace
to
prepare
at
once
again
he
suppressed
the
urge
so
he
could
ask
more
questions
where
did
they
get
such
forces
sordello
shrugged
they
are
a
big
family
they
have
relatives
in
the
outlying
towns
simon
bent
down
to
look
deep
into
sordello
bloodshot
eyes
are
you
sure
ugolini
and
david
of
trebizond
and
the
rest
are
not
involved
if
we
french
and
the
tartars
are
the
provocation
ugolini
must
be
behind
this
sordello
tapped
his
cheek
just
under
his
right
eye
your
signory
i
watch
them
as
closely
as
those
priests
watch
the
miraculous
altar
cloth
ugolini
has
been
in
despair
all
winter
since
fra
tomasso
changed
sides
he
buries
himself
in
his
cabinet
with
his
magical
instruments
david
has
lost
interest
in
the
tartars
and
thinks
only
about
trade
he
talks
to
giancarlo
of
making
up
a
caravan
to
go
back
to
trebizond
the
two
of
them
left
for
perugia
on
business
yesterday
what
about
giancarlo
bravos
altogether
giancarlo
has
hired
only
a
dozen
such
men
including
myself
we
guard
david
goods
and
escort
his
caravans
sordello
waved
a
hand
in
dismissal
and
what
of
the
cardinal
niece
said
simon
trying
not
to
sound
especially
interested
sordello
shrugged
that
lovely
lady
stays
apart
she
goes
to
church
she
reads
she
paints
worried
though
he
was
about
the
impending
filippeschi
attack
heart
felt
lightened
by
joy
sophia
was
innocent
his
love
for
her
was
vindicated
after
this
was
over
he
would
come
to
her
and
broach
marriage
you
must
watch
madonna
sophia
for
me
simon
said
stay
close
to
her
do
not
let
her
go
out
tonight
stay
close
to
her
sordello
grinned
that
will
not
be
hard
your
signory
simon
seized
the
front
of
sordello
tunic
never
speak
that
way
of
her
sordello
jerked
away
from
simon
and
brushed
his
tunic
i
am
a
man
your
signory
do
not
treat
me
like
a
slave
the
coarse
face
was
pale
with
outraged
pride
forgets
his
place
so
easily
but
there
is
no
one
else
to
guard
sophia
for
i
want
you
to
be
thinking
about
her
safety
and
that
alone
he
said
in
a
calmer
voice
sordello
bowed
i
understand
your
signory
but
resentment
still
burned
in
his
narrowed
eyes
in
the
midst
of
his
fear
like
a
single
candle
glowing
in
a
cathedral
simon
felt
a
tingle
of
anticipation
there
was
something
in
him
deeply
buried
but
powerful
that
keenly
looked
forward
to
taking
command
in
battle
if
you
learn
any
more
try
to
get
word
to
me
he
told
sordello
he
turned
and
hurried
through
the
nave
of
the
cathedral
to
the
front
doors
still
holding
in
check
the
urge
to
run
for
them
to
attack
is
pazzia
said
the
contessa
we
have
twice
the
they
do
yet
i
pray
god
this
rumor
is
true
by
tomorrow
morning
marco
di
filippeschi
will
be
hanging
from
our
battlements
the
cords
in
her
neck
stood
out
her
nose
was
thrust
forward
like
a
beak
and
her
eyes
glittered
simon
said
with
respect
contessa
they
must
have
more
men
than
you
do
i
was
told
they
might
have
five
hundred
and
siege
machines
they
were
seated
in
the
small
council
room
of
the
monaldeschi
palace
simon
the
contessa
de
verceuil
sire
henri
de
puys
and
friar
mathieu
around
a
circular
table
of
warm
brown
wood
but
surely
we
have
better
men
said
henri
de
puys
in
french
what
sort
of
fighters
could
these
muster
routiers
highwaymen
friar
mathieu
turned
to
de
verceuil
might
i
suggest
that
your
eminence
use
your
influence
with
pope
urban
perhaps
his
holiness
can
stop
this
battle
yes
said
de
verceuil
i
will
try
to
speak
to
him
but
he
is
sick
and
pays
little
attention
to
anything
de
verceuil
is
annoyed
because
he
did
not
think
first
of
going
to
the
i
should
think
it
would
endanger
his
health
even
more
if
a
war
broke
out
in
orvieto
said
friar
mathieu
i
will
him
said
de
verceuil
but
i
will
also
arm
myself
and
my
men
to
help
defend
this
place
simon
expected
de
verceuil
to
next
propose
himself
as
commander
of
the
defense
but
to
his
delight
the
cardinal
had
nothing
more
to
say
then
the
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
de
verceuil
did
not
want
to
have
to
take
the
blame
in
case
of
defeat
grazie
your
eminence
said
the
contessa
simon
said
i
must
go
to
signore
surely
the
podesta
will
not
let
civil
war
break
out
in
the
city
he
governs
the
contessa
laughed
a
knowing
cackle
go
to
him
if
you
like
but
you
waste
your
time
he
can
not
will
not
stop
the
filippeschi
he
has
filippeschi
relatives
you
know
but
he
could
not
stop
me
either
if
i
chose
to
attack
them
friar
mathieu
said
perhaps
we
should
take
the
ambassadors
to
the
papal
palace
that
would
get
them
out
of
harm
way
until
this
is
over
simon
body
went
rigid
the
tartars
were
his
responsibility
he
would
never
give
them
up
to
the
pope
no
he
said
the
duty
of
guarding
them
is
mine
and
i
will
surrender
it
to
no
one
de
puys
struck
the
table
with
his
open
palm
bravely
spoken
monseigneur
friar
mathieu
sighed
de
verceuil
pointed
a
finger
at
simon
count
you
have
no
right
to
risk
the
ambassadors
lives
just
for
your
own
glory
simon
looked
around
the
table
he
was
the
youngest
person
here
and
they
were
treating
him
like
a
child
he
remembered
the
doge
zeno
threat
to
have
him
thrown
into
the
water
of
venice
san
marco
canal
he
remembered
the
many
times
de
verceuil
had
been
overbearing
with
him
to
think
man
would
accuse
anyone
else
of
being
too
concerned
with
his
own
glory
he
was
about
to
shout
defiance
when
he
thought
of
royal
councils
he
had
attended
as
a
page
to
king
louis
those
close
to
the
king
often
disagreed
with
him
but
they
usually
ended
up
doing
what
he
wanted
louis
was
perhaps
the
strongest
man
in
his
gentle
way
simon
had
ever
met
but
he
had
never
heard
him
raise
his
voice
instead
of
defying
de
verceuil
and
the
others
he
tried
to
speak
with
dignity
even
humility
as
king
louis
himself
might
his
majesty
brother
count
charles
entrusted
this
task
to
me
shall
i
give
it
up
at
the
first
threat
shall
i
turn
over
the
protection
to
men
unknown
to
me
some
of
whom
may
be
moved
by
the
same
hatred
of
us
french
that
moves
the
filippeschi
i
have
a
duty
not
to
let
the
ambassadors
go
beyond
the
walls
i
guard
when
he
finished
there
was
silence
friar
mathieu
said
count
simon
makes
an
excellent
point
john
and
philip
may
well
be
safer
guarded
by
our
men
even
under
attack
now
that
they
had
agreed
simon
heart
sank
if
the
tartars
were
killed
in
the
coming
battle
because
he
had
insisted
on
keeping
them
in
the
palace
he
would
bear
the
guilt
instead
of
restoring
his
name
he
would
end
by
plunging
it
deeper
into
the
mire
de
puys
looked
from
simon
to
the
cardinal
and
said
perhaps
our
knights
and
crossbowmen
could
go
with
the
tartars
to
the
pope
palace
no
cried
the
contessa
now
when
i
am
attacked
because
i
opened
my
home
to
the
tartars
and
the
french
will
you
all
abandon
me
all
the
men
of
my
family
are
dead
but
the
boy
vittorio
she
turned
to
simon
and
seized
his
wrist
with
her
clawlike
hand
you
must
stay
and
defend
me
you
must
be
my
cavaliere
simon
pressed
her
hand
in
both
of
his
and
saw
tears
running
down
her
withered
cheeks
i
would
not
think
of
leaving
you
contessa
but
contessa
said
friar
mathieu
if
the
tartars
were
to
leave
your
palace
the
filippeschi
might
not
attack
you
no
no
the
contessa
shook
her
head
if
they
think
they
are
strong
enough
to
attack
me
they
will
they
have
long
sought
to
kill
me
and
vittorio
canaglia
may
god
send
that
little
bastard
marco
and
all
the
filippeschi
straight
to
hell
friar
mathieu
winced
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
inwardly
simon
winced
too
as
he
always
did
at
the
word
bastard
but
bastard
or
not
he
was
about
to
command
a
palace
under
siege
he
felt
his
chest
swelling
at
the
thought
the
candlelit
audience
chamber
of
the
podesta
was
hung
with
somber
maroon
drapes
drawn
against
the
night
air
on
the
wall
behind
a
tapestry
depicted
jesus
and
barabbas
being
offered
to
the
crowd
in
jerusalem
while
pilate
washed
his
hands
simon
had
never
seen
such
a
large
scene
with
such
finely
embroidered
figures
and
he
admired
it
aloud
i
keep
it
here
as
a
reminder
that
a
judge
who
heeds
the
popular
clamor
may
make
a
grave
error
said
the
small
man
behind
the
large
table
how
may
i
serve
you
count
as
simon
told
the
podesta
what
he
knew
of
the
planned
filippeschi
assault
on
the
contessa
palace
leaned
back
in
a
tall
chair
that
seemed
too
big
for
him
his
eyes
distant
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
down
under
his
thin
mustache
when
simon
finished
asked
are
cardinal
ugolini
or
any
of
his
guests
involved
in
this
very
question
i
asked
sordello
interesting
that
the
podesta
shares
my
the
person
who
warned
me
said
they
were
not
peered
at
him
and
who
warned
you
i
would
rather
not
say
i
have
an
informant
in
cardinal
household
really
good
for
you
the
podesta
gave
him
a
look
of
amused
respect
that
kindled
a
warm
glow
of
pride
in
him
well
your
signory
if
there
is
a
battle
between
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
i
can
do
nothing
about
it
simon
was
swept
by
strange
mixed
feelings
he
was
ready
to
do
almost
anything
to
prevent
the
coming
battle
but
in
the
midst
of
his
despair
at
refusal
to
help
he
kept
seeing
himself
in
armor
rallying
his
men
on
the
monaldeschi
battlements
but
he
had
to
try
to
persuade
to
help
he
could
not
leave
without
having
done
his
best
is
it
not
your
duty
to
keep
the
peace
in
orvieto
all
my
watchmen
together
are
not
a
tenth
of
the
number
of
armed
men
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
can
put
into
the
streets
i
assure
you
that
if
the
watch
did
try
to
stop
the
fight
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
would
join
forces
and
annihilate
my
men
before
they
went
on
to
tear
each
other
to
pieces
look
your
signory
mine
is
a
lifetime
appointment
which
means
that
how
long
i
live
depends
on
how
well
i
please
those
who
appointed
me
the
families
wish
me
to
prevent
or
punish
fraud
theft
rape
and
murder
but
when
the
families
have
quarrels
that
can
be
settled
only
by
bloodshed
they
want
no
interference
did
the
contessa
send
you
here
to
appeal
for
my
help
no
she
told
me
you
could
not
stop
the
filippeschi
said
simon
appalled
at
this
glimpse
of
the
chaos
that
lay
under
the
pretty
surface
of
this
town
nodded
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
of
course
no
doubt
she
sees
this
as
her
chance
to
kill
off
marco
di
filippeschi
something
she
has
longed
to
do
for
years
i
can
not
do
what
you
ask
i
know
the
limits
of
my
power
power
thought
simon
brute
strength
that
was
what
would
decide
this
clash
and
all
he
could
do
was
make
sure
his
side
was
stronger
he
felt
a
resolve
at
once
grim
and
gleeful
growing
inside
him
he
stood
up
and
inclined
his
head
the
stout
little
man
rose
and
bowed
back
then
i
can
not
rely
on
you
simon
said
shrugged
i
am
still
trying
to
discover
the
murderer
of
your
companion
i
have
learned
that
neither
david
of
trebizond
nor
his
servant
giancarlo
were
in
cardinal
ugolini
palace
when
your
friend
was
killed
i
think
tonight
while
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
are
at
each
other
throats
the
best
place
for
me
would
be
at
ugolini
asking
those
two
worthies
where
they
were
that
night
if
i
can
not
find
out
perhaps
your
informant
in
that
household
could
help
why
not
ask
her
thinks
i
was
talking
about
simon
wished
he
could
go
to
sophia
what
if
he
were
killed
tonight
and
never
saw
her
again
he
wished
there
was
at
least
time
to
send
her
a
poem
had
probably
guessed
that
simon
was
visiting
sophia
when
alain
was
murdered
simon
felt
his
face
grow
hot
with
chagrin
he
had
failed
to
keep
his
secret
his
and
sophia
he
remembered
sordello
telling
him
that
david
and
giancarlo
had
gone
to
perugia
simon
could
save
from
a
waste
of
time
by
telling
him
that
why
bother
he
been
no
help
to
angry
with
the
podesta
and
with
himself
and
unwilling
to
yield
any
more
information
to
the
little
man
simon
took
his
leave
with
two
of
his
knights
the
sires
de
borione
and
de
vilbiz
flanking
him
simon
hurried
back
from
the
podesta
palace
to
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
they
looked
over
their
shoulders
so
often
as
they
strode
through
the
darkening
street
that
simon
began
to
feel
they
were
looking
backward
as
much
as
forward
but
no
bravos
sprang
at
them
from
ambush
no
arrows
flew
from
housetops
indeed
the
streets
were
unusually
quiet
and
empty
for
late
saturday
afternoon
with
the
clink
of
the
spurs
and
the
tramp
of
their
heels
on
the
cobbles
the
loudest
sounds
of
all
windows
were
shuttered
doors
closed
tight
the
whole
neighborhood
thought
simon
must
be
aware
of
what
was
about
to
happen
they
turned
a
corner
into
the
square
before
the
monaldeschi
palace
and
heard
the
sound
of
hammers
simon
had
ordered
de
puys
to
supervise
the
building
of
slanting
wooden
screens
above
the
battlements
to
be
covered
with
wet
blankets
to
protect
the
roof
from
fire
arrows
the
job
was
almost
done
and
simon
reminded
himself
to
compliment
de
puys
when
he
saw
him
his
first
task
here
at
the
palace
was
to
insure
the
safety
of
the
tartars
he
had
already
decided
that
the
safest
place
in
the
palace
was
the
spice
pantry
in
the
cellar
and
what
if
the
palace
were
overwhelmed
and
the
tartars
were
trapped
and
killed
in
the
spice
pantry
simon
made
up
his
mind
that
he
himself
would
not
surrender
the
filippeschi
would
have
to
kill
him
to
get
to
the
tartars
friar
mathieu
answered
simon
knock
simon
had
never
seen
the
chambers
before
and
he
was
shocked
mattresses
covered
with
blankets
lay
along
the
walls
rugs
and
cushions
were
scattered
about
but
there
was
no
bed
table
or
chair
to
be
seen
an
overpowering
smell
of
burnt
meat
filled
the
first
room
simon
entered
in
the
center
of
the
wooden
floor
an
area
about
three
feet
across
was
covered
with
blackened
flagstones
and
atop
the
stones
was
a
heap
of
charred
wood
beside
this
crude
hearth
was
a
pile
of
broken
animal
bones
melon
rinds
and
other
refuse
an
open
wine
barrel
added
its
sweetish
smell
to
the
general
odor
of
smoke
and
decay
simon
wondered
whether
the
contessa
had
seen
this
squalor
she
had
shown
the
tartars
special
favor
giving
them
three
rooms
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
third
floor
in
most
palaces
a
single
room
was
the
most
even
a
very
distinguished
visitor
could
expect
if
she
thought
they
were
savages
after
david
of
trebizond
had
baited
them
at
her
reception
what
would
she
think
after
seeing
this
pigsty
john
and
philip
rose
at
simon
entrance
and
bowed
smiling
broadly
they
seemed
not
the
least
embarrassed
by
the
foul
condition
of
their
chambers
simon
bowed
back
trying
also
to
smile
if
cardinal
ugolini
were
to
show
these
rooms
to
the
sacred
college
many
of
the
cardinals
would
join
him
in
detesting
the
tartars
simon
said
to
friar
mathieu
a
wonder
the
smoke
has
not
smothered
them
with
a
wry
smile
friar
mathieu
pointed
at
the
ceiling
an
irregular
hole
had
been
broken
through
above
the
tartars
hearth
fortunately
for
everyone
they
are
on
the
top
floor
of
the
palace
the
franciscan
said
all
they
have
tried
to
do
is
reproduce
the
kind
of
home
they
are
used
to
living
in
even
to
the
smoke
hole
in
the
roof
the
john
said
something
in
the
tartar
tongue
to
friar
mathieu
they
have
heard
of
the
coming
fight
the
franciscan
said
they
want
weapons
and
a
place
on
the
battlements
they
say
it
is
their
duty
as
guests
to
defend
their
hostess
the
contessa
simon
tensed
himself
for
trouble
he
had
feared
this
he
chose
his
words
carefully
i
am
sure
the
contessa
will
be
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
when
i
tell
her
of
such
a
gracious
offer
but
we
would
not
want
to
have
to
answer
to
the
mighty
hulagu
khan
if
something
happened
to
them
or
to
their
noble
mission
tell
them
that
and
that
it
is
duty
to
keep
safe
there
is
a
stone
storeroom
underneath
the
kitchen
a
spice
pantry
i
have
explored
the
palace
and
that
is
the
securest
place
they
must
go
there
the
moment
the
filippeschi
attack
they
should
take
the
armenians
with
them
the
tartars
looked
angry
and
shouted
vigorous
staccato
protests
when
friar
mathieu
translated
this
philip
the
younger
one
especially
addressed
himself
to
simon
philip
seized
the
oblong
gold
tablet
of
office
that
hung
around
his
neck
and
shook
it
at
simon
he
reminds
you
that
his
title
is
baghadur
which
means
valiant
he
says
you
insult
him
by
asking
him
to
hide
in
the
cellar
among
his
people
nobody
hides
even
the
women
and
children
fight
simon
felt
his
assurance
collapsing
what
if
the
tartars
simply
refused
to
seek
safety
he
could
not
put
them
in
chains
earnestly
he
said
tell
them
it
is
their
duty
to
their
khan
to
stay
alive
and
continue
negotiations
be
as
courteous
as
you
have
the
power
to
be
in
their
language
oh
i
am
being
very
polite
one
always
is
with
them
after
another
exchange
friar
mathieu
said
they
say
hulagu
khan
would
expect
them
to
fight
simon
had
a
sudden
inspiration
tell
them
that
if
they
were
to
fight
and
if
anything
happened
to
them
even
the
slightest
injury
the
king
of
france
would
cut
my
head
off
there
was
a
particle
of
truth
in
that
simon
thought
as
friar
mathieu
translated
kindly
as
king
louis
was
decapitation
would
be
preferable
to
facing
his
reproach
if
simon
weakness
caused
the
tartars
death
john
shrugged
and
answered
friar
mathieu
quietly
simon
held
his
breath
praying
that
this
last
effort
would
work
friar
mathieu
said
john
says
that
you
are
a
brave
young
warrior
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
your
head
cut
off
when
you
have
a
lifetime
of
battles
ahead
of
you
for
your
sake
they
will
forgo
the
pleasure
of
this
fight
but
they
insist
on
taking
only
two
guards
with
them
they
insist
that
the
rest
of
their
men
fight
beside
yours
relief
washed
over
simon
he
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
think
as
quickly
in
the
coming
battle
as
he
had
just
then
i
can
use
their
other
men
have
whatever
the
ambassadors
need
for
their
comfort
carried
to
the
spice
pantry
he
looked
again
at
the
pile
of
garbage
tell
them
they
will
be
next
to
the
kitchen
they
should
like
that
xlii
count
simon
simon
recognized
the
crackling
voice
of
the
contessa
she
was
wearing
a
gown
of
deep
purple
velvet
she
held
up
a
bronze
medallion
on
a
silver
chain
please
take
this
my
young
paladino
wear
it
into
battle
for
me
simon
went
to
her
his
feet
echoing
in
the
hallway
all
his
movements
felt
slow
and
clumsy
in
the
mail
shirt
that
hung
to
his
thighs
and
the
mail
breeches
that
protected
him
from
waist
to
ankle
embossed
on
the
medallion
was
a
mounted
knight
driving
his
lance
into
a
coiling
dragon
baring
huge
fangs
in
rage
where
the
lance
pierced
the
scales
was
set
a
tiny
ruby
thank
you
donna
elvira
he
breathed
full
of
admiration
for
the
workmanship
it
is
most
beautiful
she
reached
up
and
put
it
around
his
neck
he
could
feel
its
weight
through
his
mail
shirt
san
giorgio
it
was
my
husband
and
i
have
kept
it
locked
away
in
my
jewel
casket
since
the
day
the
puzzolenti
filippeschi
murdered
him
it
is
yours
now
san
giorgio
will
give
you
victory
she
raised
her
thin
body
on
tiptoe
and
he
felt
her
dry
lips
press
against
his
cheek
i
will
never
forget
this
moment
madonna
he
touched
her
yellow
cheeks
with
his
fingertips
to
brush
away
her
tears
he
did
not
want
her
to
know
that
this
was
his
first
his
very
first
battle
climbing
the
spiral
stairs
to
the
tower
his
legs
ached
as
he
pushed
his
mailed
weight
upward
and
his
neck
felt
strained
under
his
mail
hood
and
steel
helmet
it
had
been
weeks
since
he
had
worn
his
mail
days
since
he
had
practiced
his
sword
drill
he
swore
at
himself
he
emerged
through
a
trapdoor
onto
a
square
platform
paved
with
flagstone
three
helmeted
heads
turned
to
him

his
head
covered
with
mail
leaving
only
a
circle
for
his
eyes
nose
and
mustached
mouth
teodoro

de
verceuil
whose
tall
helmet
was
painted
bright
red
and
shaped
like
a
cardinal
mitre
covering
his
entire
face
with
the
stem
of
a
gold
cross
running
up
the
center
and
the
arms
of
the
cross
spread
over
the
eyeholes
dressed
for
war
de
verceuil
looked
more
like
a
cardinal
than
he
usually
did
simon
thought
ironically
of
the
four
men
on
the
tower
platform
de
verceuil
wore
the
most
elaborate
armor
with
steel
plates
over
his
mail
at
his
shoulders
knees
and
shins
hanging
from
a
broad
belt
at
his
side
was
a
mace
an
iron
ball
on
the
end
of
a
steel
handle
a
foot
long
this
was
simon
knew
the
proper
weapon
for
a
clergyman
who
was
not
supposed
to
shed
blood
over
his
mail
shirt
de
verceuil
wore
a
long
crimson
surcoat
sewn
with
maltese
crosses
de
puys
like
simon
wore
a
purple
surcoat
on
which
the
three
gold
crowns
of
gobignon
were
embroidered
over
and
over
again
teodoro
simple
breastplate
of
hardened
leather
was
reinforced
with
steel
plates
leaning
into
a
crenel
between
two
square
merlons
simon
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
mild
spring
air
it
would
be
a
pleasant
evening
did
he
not
know
that
many
men
were
going
to
die
he
watched
the
last
wagons
bringing
in
casks
of
water
and
wine
loads
of
hay
and
sacks
of
grain
and
beans
supplies
in
case
the
fighting
dragged
on
over
the
drawbridge
through
the
rear
gate
water
especially
was
in
short
supply
in
the
city
on
the
rock
the
palace
had
its
own
spring
but
it
did
not
produce
enough
water
to
supply
the
whole
establishment
simon
remembered
sophia
drinking
from
his
hands
in
the
garden
he
stopped
short
at
the
thought
of
her
to
whisper
a
little
prayer
for
her
safety
but
she
was
in
no
danger
no
one
was
threatening
cardinal
ugolini
simon
had
ordered
that
every
cask
of
water
available
in
orvieto
be
bought
and
every
vessel
filled
the
attackers
would
surely
use
fire
as
a
weapon
he
had
also
sent
for
a
supply
of
rocks
from
a
quarry
outside
the
city
extra
ammunition
for
the
stone
casters
mounted
on
the
roof
he
recalled
that
sordello
had
said
the
filippeschi
intended
a
surprise
attack
they
were
certain
to
learn
of
these
preparations
and
realize
that
the
monaldeschi
had
discovered
their
plan
what
if
they
did
not
come
at
all
if
the
fact
that
the
monaldeschi
were
ready
was
enough
to
prevent
the
attack
that
would
be
the
best
possible
outcome
but
simon
realized
with
a
pang
that
if
the
filippeschi
did
not
come
he
would
be
terribly
disappointed
he
shook
his
head
at
his
own
madness
sunset
reddened
the
tile
roofs
surrounding
the
monaldeschi
palace
from
up
there
simon
could
see
the
tall
campaniles
of
orvieto
five
churches
and
the
towers
of
the
other
palaces
all
battlements
square
because
this
was
a
guelfo
city
a
green
flag
too
small
from
this
distance
to
make
out
the
device
on
it
flew
over
a
tower
on
the
southwest
side
of
the
city
the
palace
of
the
filippeschi
he
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
to
look
at
the
city
wall
orange
and
green
monaldeschi
banners
flew
there
he
had
assigned
twenty
monaldeschi
archers
all
he
dared
subtract
from
the
defenders
of
the
palace
to
secure
the
nearest
section
of
the
wall
he
had
wanted
to
station
men
in
the
houses
near
the
palace
as
well
but
de
puys
persuaded
him
that
such
outposts
would
surely
be
overrun
and
the
men
speedily
lost
better
to
concentrate
his
forces
in
the
palace
itself
he
could
not
make
out
cardinal
ugolini
house
somewhere
to
the
southeast
of
him
it
had
no
tower
to
distinguish
it
but
he
thought
again
of
sophia
how
lovely
it
would
be
to
be
with
her
sitting
and
chatting
instead
of
up
in
this
tower
awaiting
a
deadly
onslaught
how
wonderful
if
his
only
worry
were
whether
or
not
she
would
accept
his
marriage
proposal
he
stared
out
over
the
city
and
thought
somewhere
out
there
was
another
enemy
even
if
as
sordello
reported
cardinal
ugolini
were
not
behind
this
attack
there
might
be
someone
behind
both
the
filippeschi
and
cardinal
ugolini
ever
since
he
had
come
to
orvieto
simon
had
sensed
the
presence
in
this
city
of
a
hidden
enemy
an
enemy
who
knew
him
and
watched
him
but
whom
he
did
not
know
the
one
simon
was
sure
of
it
who
had
killed
alain
am
waiting
for
he
said
gripping
the
red
bricks
of
the
battlements
every
old
soldier
simon
had
ever
talked
to
had
said
that
war
consisted
more
of
waiting
than
of
fighting
simon
found
the
combination
of
boredom
and
fear
well
nigh
unbearable
de
puys
sat
with
his
back
against
the
battlements
and
dozed
like
a
large
cat
de
verceuil
also
sat
his
helmet
on
the
tower
floor
beside
him
reading
from
a
small
book
whispering
the
latin
words
simon
supposed
it
must
be
his
office
the
prayers
every
priest
was
required
to
say
every
day
the
cardinal
would
have
to
get
today
office
read
quickly
the
light
was
fading
fast
capitano
teodoro
preferred
to
be
busy
he
kept
shuttling
back
and
forth
between
the
tower
and
rooftop
two
stories
below
where
his
men
were
deployed
teodoro
would
make
a
circuit
of
the
tower
battlements
frowning
down
at
his
company
of
archers
then
he
would
go
down
and
order
six
or
so
men
to
change
position
he
would
inspect
everyone
weapons
he
inspected
the
bows
of
even
the
eight
armenians
in
their
bright
red
surcoats
who
would
fight
beside
the
venetians
the
friction
between
the
armenians
and
the
venetians
simon
had
noticed
had
lessened
considerably
after
he
promoted
teodoro
he
was
a
good
leader
at
the
contessa
request
teodoro
inspected
the
monaldeschi
who
were
mostly
stationed
at
the
two
gates
and
in
the
hallways
and
apartment
windows
after
each
inspection
tour
teodoro
would
come
back
up
study
the
situation
then
go
down
and
rearrange
the
men
likely
as
not
returning
them
to
their
earlier
positions
but
staying
busy
made
sense
it
kept
everyone
alert
simon
left
the
tower
once
to
visit
his
four
knights
on
the
rooftop
each
one
stationed
with
six
by
a
stone
caster
at
a
corner
of
the
roof
so
that
their
missiles
would
clear
the
screening
he
had
built
over
the
battlements
the
machines
were
set
well
back
from
the
edge
of
the
roof
the
knights
did
not
like
supervising
the
stone
casters
they
wanted
they
told
him
a
chance
to
charge
the
enemy
during
the
attack
simon
tried
to
be
about
insisting
that
they
remain
within
the
palace
but
it
was
hard
giving
orders
to
men
who
were
older
than
himself
and
combat
veterans
he
missed
alain
realizing
only
now
how
much
he
had
relied
on
his
young
friend
as
a
for
himself
and
the
other
knights
returning
to
the
tower
roof
simon
kept
pacing
from
one
corner
to
the
other
he
fingered
the
jeweled
hilt
of
his
scimitar
he
tried
to
divert
himself
by
thinking
of
sophia
by
imagining
how
he
would
phrase
his
marriage
proposal
to
her
he
dreaded
the
fighting
but
wished
it
would
start
like
a
rising
tide
the
shadows
spread
and
deepened
swallowing
up
the
hills
beyond
the
city
then
the
city
walls
then
the
towers
the
four
men
stood
in
darkness
no
torchlight
up
here
to
make
them
an
easy
target
the
only
light
on
the
roof
below
was
the
shimmer
of
charcoals
burning
in
four
braziers
for
fire
arrows
an
orange
glow
appeared
over
the
hills
to
the
east
the
moon
starting
to
rise
simon
heard
distant
shouting
battle
cries
filippeschi
it
was
teodoro
voice
simon
saw
flickering
red
light
dancing
on
house
walls
coming
toward
them
converging
from
front
sides
and
rear
the
streets
were
too
narrow
to
permit
sight
of
the
advancing
bravos
and
their
torches
even
though
they
know
we
are
ready
for
them
they
have
from
the
street
directly
opposite
the
main
entrance
to
the
palace
a
long
dark
shape
emerged
like
a
gigantic
tortoise
similar
shapes
issued
from
other
streets
opening
on
the
piazza
the
tortoises
were
big
enough
to
shelter
at
least
a
dozen
men
there
were
six
of
them
crawling
across
the
open
space
use
the
fire
arrows
simon
shouted
teodoro
repeated
the
order
to
his
men
on
the
roof
below
men
raced
from
the
battlements
to
the
braziers
and
back
again
and
streaks
of
light
arced
from
the
rooftop
at
the
tortoise
shapes
simon
could
hear
the
burning
arrows
sizzle
on
the
wet
wooden
frameworks
and
wet
hides
the
hides
did
not
burn
but
the
light
from
the
arrows
made
it
easier
for
the
crossbowmen
shooting
from
the
battlements
to
see
their
targets
teodoro
was
down
on
the
roof
directing
their
fire
the
archers
volleyed
at
the
closest
tortoise
the
steel
bolts
tore
right
through
the
skins
piercing
the
men
beneath
simon
heard
the
thump
of
thirty
bolts
striking
a
tortoise
at
once
then
screams
the
framework
stopped
moving
and
simon
saw
men
crawling
from
under
it
some
ran
frantically
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
side
streets
others
crept
a
few
paces
and
collapsed
something
whizzed
past
simon
head
and
struck
the
brick
merlon
beside
him
a
shower
of
chips
clattered
on
his
mail
one
stung
his
cheek
shooting
back
said
teodoro
from
the
sides
torchlight
flickered
from
behind
wooden
mantlets
at
the
mouths
of
the
streets
approaching
the
palace
from
the
north
and
south
the
rectangles
of
wood
filled
the
street
from
side
to
side
from
this
height
simon
could
see
the
crowds
of
men
behind
each
mantlet
fire
arrows
from
mantlets
and
tortoises
hissed
overhead
and
fell
trailing
sparks
into
the
atrium
of
the
palace
simon
heard
splashes
as
servants
threw
water
on
the
trees
put
more
of
your
men
on
the
sides
he
said
to
teodoro
who
hurried
down
the
stairs
inside
the
tower
the
moon
was
now
a
red
oval
low
in
the
eastern
sky
the
light
would
help
the
filippeschi
target
the
defenders
on
the
rooftop
but
it
would
not
expose
them
in
the
streets
a
loud
crash
startled
simon
and
he
felt
the
tower
floor
shake
another
crash
and
another
stone
casters
the
stones
were
coming
from
all
directions
and
simon
could
hear
screams
he
turned
to
de
puys
fire
our
stone
casters
with
de
puys
gone
only
simon
and
the
cardinal
were
left
in
the
tower
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
the
cardinal
had
donned
his
helmet
at
the
first
sign
of
the
filippeschi
and
simon
could
not
see
his
face
simon
longed
for
teodoro
to
come
back
it
was
simon
equerry
thierry
who
pushed
open
the
trapdoor
capitano
teodoro
is
hit
blood
of
god
simon
pushed
past
de
puys
to
hurry
down
the
inner
staircase
teodoro
lay
near
the
entrance
to
the
tower
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
his
breathing
came
in
hoarse
gasps
alternating
with
grunts
of
pain
it
was
too
dark
for
simon
to
see
him
well
he
knelt
beside
teodoro
and
a
vile
smell
of
excrement
choked
him
someone
beside
simon
was
sobbing
teodoro
had
been
much
liked
among
the
venetians
carefully
simon
felt
down
the
capitano
body
the
hard
leather
cuirass
he
wore
was
cracked
down
the
center
just
below
his
chest
simon
hand
met
the
huge
rock
it
was
wet
probably
with
teodoro
blood
it
caught
him
right
in
the
middle
said
an
archer
standing
over
simon
broke
him
in
two
crushed
his
belly
and
his
spine
only
the
part
of
him
above
the
stone
is
alive
a
gurgling
sound
rose
in
teodoro
throat
he
was
vomiting
and
warm
liquid
gushed
over
simon
hand
his
own
stomach
writhed
and
bile
burned
his
throat
he
stood
up
suddenly
and
instantly
regretted
it
because
he
had
wanted
to
comfort
teodoro
in
his
dying
but
the
gasping
had
stopped
teodoro
had
probably
never
known
he
was
there
simon
hands
and
knees
were
trembling
this
is
what
it
is
like
to
be
killed
in
he
wiped
his
hand
on
his
surcoat
careful
to
make
his
voice
firm
he
ordered
the
archers
back
to
their
positions
the
weight
of
his
mail
almost
unbearable
he
stumbled
back
to
the
doorway
to
the
tower
he
felt
his
arm
gripped
and
heard
friar
mathieu
voice
simon
i
heard
you
lost
your
capitano
of
archers
this
is
much
worse
than
i
ever
thought
it
would
be
father
he
whispered
almost
as
if
confessing
the
hand
on
his
arm
squeezed
through
his
mail
trust
yourself
simon
you
will
do
what
you
must
do
by
the
light
of
a
fire
arrow
burning
itself
out
in
the
overhead
screen
simon
saw
the
contessa
her
purple
gown
tied
up
to
her
knees
so
she
could
move
more
quickly
she
called
friar
mathieu
to
see
to
a
wounded
man
then
greeted
simon
thinks
i
am
a
hero
if
only
she
knew
the
horror
i
who
was
teodoro
yes
peppino
peppino
was
the
one
who
had
fought
with
the
armenians
at
alain
funeral
but
a
new
capitano
must
be
appointed
immediately
there
was
no
time
to
balance
considerations
he
managed
to
find
peppino
and
appointed
him
to
lead
the
venetians
then
on
shaking
legs
he
pushed
himself
back
up
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
they
are
bombarding
the
rear
gatehouse
with
mangonels
de
puys
said
simon
heard
rocks
thudding
against
the
drawbridge
at
the
rear
of
the
palace
the
entrance
for
horses
and
wagons
by
moonlight
he
was
able
to
make
out
across
the
street
from
the
rear
of
the
palace
four
mangonels
stone
guns
shaped
like
giant
crossbows
where
did
the
filippeschi
get
so
many
men
and
machines
simon
wondered
aloud
one
would
suppose
you
could
answer
that
said
de
verceuil
his
voice
muffled
by
his
helmet
are
you
not
our
military
expert
simon
was
still
too
gripped
by
horror
to
be
angry
but
a
part
of
his
mind
somehow
kept
trying
to
think
about
what
the
filippeschi
intended
he
became
lost
in
thought
as
he
gnawed
at
the
problem
and
all
but
forgot
the
battle
raging
around
him
numerous
as
they
seemed
the
filippeschi
had
just
a
chance
no
more
than
that
of
overwhelming
the
monaldeschi
palace
especially
having
lost
the
advantage
of
surprise
was
their
hatred
of
the
monaldeschi
so
deep
that
such
an
uncertain
chance
was
reason
enough
for
them
to
make
this
effort
i
could
but
capture
marco
di
filippeschi
and
force
him
to
tell
me
why
he
is
doing
this
what
if
this
attack
were
a
diversion
a
cover
for
the
real
blow
to
be
struck
by
stealth
simon
body
went
cold
i
must
see
to
the
tartar
ambassadors
he
said
he
turned
toward
the
trapdoor
in
the
tower
roof
monseigneur
look
the
filippeschi
are
attacking
again
de
puys
protested
simon
turned
back
looked
over
the
edge
and
saw
the
tortoise
shapes
moving
forward
again
over
the
piazza
while
stones
from
mangonels
slammed
into
the
gatehouse
he
thought
if
they
break
down
the
door
they
could
never
get
up
the
stairs
this
attack
is
a
i
believe
the
ambassadors
are
in
danger
he
said
by
god
robe
de
verceuil
boomed
from
under
his
helmet
you
are
quitting
the
battle
the
battle
is
where
the
ambassadors
are
simon
said
the
whole
purpose
of
this
attack
is
to
get
at
them
the
whole
purpose
of
your
saying
that
is
to
get
out
of
danger
de
verceuil
retorted
simon
quivered
with
rage
de
verceuil
eyes
glittered
coldly
at
him
in
the
moonlight
through
holes
cut
in
the
helmet
simon
wished
he
could
draw
his
sword
and
swing
it
at
the
damned
cardinal
head
but
he
felt
as
if
he
were
suddenly
wrapped
in
chains
with
de
verceuil
accusing
him
of
cowardice
how
could
he
leave
the
tower
de
puys
put
a
steadying
hand
on
his
arm
monseigneur
no
one
can
get
at
the
ambassadors
not
as
long
as
we
hold
fast
here
in
the
florid
face
with
its
drooping
mustaches
simon
saw
pity
but
also
a
trace
of
contempt
the
old
warrior
too
thought
his
young
seigneur
wanted
to
run
away
if
simon
left
the
tower
now
he
would
have
to
bear
his
vassal
scorn
nor
was
it
likely
that
de
puys
would
keep
silent
about
this
the
tale
would
spread
throughout
the
gobignon
domain
i
know
i
am
not
a
searching
his
heart
he
knew
that
though
he
was
afraid
of
the
flying
crossbow
bolts
and
stones
he
could
direct
the
battle
from
the
tower
all
night
if
need
be
even
after
teodoro
death
and
the
blood
still
sticky
on
the
mailed
glove
that
hung
from
his
right
wrist
he
felt
strong
enough
to
go
on
fighting
if
he
went
to
the
ambassadors
and
no
one
struck
at
them
he
would
have
been
mistaken
but
his
leaving
here
would
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
battle
what
was
happening
out
here
was
a
simple
matter
of
force
against
force
if
he
remained
here
and
the
tartars
were
attacked
and
murdered
all
would
be
lost
i
do
not
do
what
i
believe
i
should
because
i
am
afraid
of
what
these
men
think
then
truly
i
am
a
he
tried
to
make
the
other
two
understand
the
safety
of
the
ambassadors
is
my
first
obligation
enemies
could
be
in
the
palace
now
de
verceuil
brought
his
face
close
to
simon
it
is
known
that
there
is
tainted
blood
in
your
family
simon
face
went
as
hot
as
if
a
torch
had
suddenly
been
thrust
at
him
it
was
a
moment
before
he
could
speak
if
you
were
not
a
man
of
the
church
i
would
kill
you
for
saying
that
his
voice
trembled
really
i
doubt
you
would
dare
de
verceuil
turned
away
monseigneur
de
puys
cried
his
face
redder
than
ever
do
not
make
me
ashamed
to
wear
the
purple
and
gold
that
hurt
even
more
than
what
de
verceuil
had
said
it
hurt
so
much
simon
wanted
to
weep
with
anger
and
frustration
instead
he
bent
forward
and
lifted
the
trapdoor
and
hurried
down
the
steps
he
heard
de
verceuil
say
something
to
de
puys
but
he
could
not
hear
what
it
was
fortunately
he
stopped
on
the
roof
to
look
for
friar
mathieu
groups
of
crossbowmen
were
running
from
one
side
to
the
other
friar
mathieu
was
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
a
fallen
man
i
think
the
tartars
may
be
in
danger
friar
mathieu
simon
said
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
so
that
i
can
talk
to
them
to
simon
relief
the
old
franciscan
did
not
object
let
us
take
two
of
the
armenians
with
us
he
said
if
there
is
danger
you
should
not
go
alone
now
that
he
was
away
from
de
verceuil
and
de
puys
simon
could
reflect
that
he
might
indeed
be
mistaken
but
he
had
to
act
even
though
he
doubted
himself
simon
friar
mathieu
and
two
armenian
warriors
named
stefan
and
grigor
hurried
down
the
tower
inner
staircase
to
the
ground
floor
single
candles
burning
low
lit
the
corridor
at
long
intervals
here
were
storerooms
and
cubbyholes
where
servants
worked
and
lived
the
relentless
pounding
of
rocks
reverberated
in
the
stone
walls
punctuated
by
occasional
screams
penetrating
through
the
arrow
slits
monaldeschi
standing
at
the
embrasures
with
crossbows
kept
their
backs
turned
to
simon
as
he
hurried
past
an
odor
of
damp
stone
pervaded
the
still
air
simon
noted
that
as
he
had
ordered
buckets
of
water
had
been
placed
along
the
corridor
to
douse
fires
the
kitchen
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
building
it
was
dark
as
a
cave
the
cooking
fire
in
the
great
fireplace
big
enough
for
a
man
to
walk
into
it
had
been
put
out
they
passed
empty
cauldrons
piles
of
full
sacks
rows
of
barrels
all
barely
visible
in
the
light
of
a
taper
in
a
candlestick
on
a
table
a
large
water
cask
surrounded
by
buckets
and
pots
stood
in
the
center
of
the
kitchen
attackers
could
be
hiding
here
but
simon
knew
he
did
not
have
enough
men
to
search
he
must
get
to
the
tartars
and
stay
with
them
the
pantry
where
the
contessa
kept
her
costly
stock
of
spices
imported
from
the
east
was
below
ground
stefan
lifted
a
heavy
trapdoor
and
one
by
one
they
climbed
down
a
narrow
flight
of
wooden
steps
without
a
banister
grigor
bringing
up
the
rear
held
a
candle
to
light
their
way
a
door
of
rough
oaken
planks
bound
together
with
iron
straps
stood
before
him
he
felt
his
stomach
knot
as
he
walked
up
to
it
what
if
he
were
too
late
simon
had
ordered
that
the
square
black
iron
lock
set
in
the
door
be
left
unlocked
in
the
case
the
tartars
should
have
to
escape
he
pulled
on
the
handle
the
door
was
bolted
from
the
inside
of
course
with
a
bolt
he
had
only
that
afternoon
ordered
the
monaldeschi
carpenter
to
install
from
the
other
side
a
voice
asked
a
question
it
is
count
simon
he
said
let
us
in
friar
mathieu
added
a
few
words
in
the
tartar
tongue
the
bolt
slid
back
and
the
door
opened
inward
simon
stepped
forward
to
see
how
his
charges
had
fared
the
storeroom
was
dimly
lit
by
a
small
oil
lantern
the
two
armenians
within
had
risen
from
chairs
they
had
their
bows
in
their
hands
arrows
nocked
they
stood
in
front
of
the
tartars
john
the
tartar
and
philip
the
one
sat
on
cushions
on
the
floor
leaning
back
against
the
shelves
of
spice
jars
that
covered
three
walls
of
the
room
their
bows
were
on
the
table
and
their
curving
swords
in
scabbards
lay
in
their
laps
simon
was
pleased
to
see
that
they
looked
alert
it
must
be
maddening
to
sit
down
here
in
semidarkness
and
do
nothing
while
a
battle
raged
above
he
reminded
himself
that
if
no
one
attacked
the
tartars
while
the
filippeschi
besieged
the
palace
his
reputation
would
be
ruined
he
felt
a
momentary
pang
of
anguish
and
found
himself
actually
hoping
that
the
enemy
would
come
here
quickly
he
stifled
the
feeling
not
call
on
the
devil
he
may
hear
you
and
xliii
hidden
in
the
cellar
behind
a
rack
of
wine
barrels
daoud
watched
the
frankish
count
the
old
priest
and
the
two
armenians
as
they
paused
before
the
door
of
the
spice
pantry
he
thought
can
plan
and
plan
but
god
will
surprise
and
he
had
been
just
about
to
try
to
trick
the
tartars
into
letting
him
into
the
spice
pantry
when
de
gobignon
and
the
others
came
down
the
stairs
he
suppressed
his
fury
and
forced
himself
to
stay
calm
the
spice
pantry
door
opened
for
de
gobignon
and
those
with
him
from
his
hiding
place
daoud
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
the
tartars
both
sitting
with
sheathed
swords
in
their
laps
their
two
guards
standing
in
front
of
them
their
refuge
appeared
to
be
lit
by
a
single
lantern
daoud
was
perhaps
only
twelve
paces
from
the
doorway
but
the
cellar
was
mostly
in
darkness
and
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
his
head
covered
with
a
tight
black
hood
his
face
masked
for
ease
and
silence
of
movement
he
wore
no
mail
the
garb
of
a
fedawi
a
hashishiyya
fighter
with
gestures
de
gobignon
ordered
his
two
armenians
to
stand
guard
outside
the
door
one
set
a
candle
in
a
sconce
high
in
the
cellar
wall
then
they
unslung
their
bows
and
nocked
arrows
and
stood
on
either
side
of
the
door
which
closed
behind
gobignon
and
the
old
priest
daoud
heard
a
bolt
slide
shut
with
a
clank
baffled
he
bit
his
lower
lip
what
demon
had
inspired
de
gobignon
to
come
down
from
the
battlements
and
join
the
tartars
just
at
this
moment
now
he
could
not
get
to
the
pantry
door
without
being
seen
and
having
to
fight
the
two
armenians
outside
that
would
alert
those
inside
and
the
door
was
bolted
from
within
he
took
deep
breaths
to
clear
his
head
of
frustration
he
would
have
to
change
his
plan
of
attack
to
get
into
the
monaldeschi
palace
he
had
used
a
peasant
cloak
and
high
boots
like
those
he
had
worn
last
summer
when
he
landed
at
manfredonia
it
had
been
an
easy
matter
paying
a
few
silver
denari
to
a
farmer
and
then
helping
with
the
loading
and
unloading
of
sacks
of
rice
being
delivered
to
the
monaldeschi
once
inside
the
palace
courtyard
it
had
been
the
work
of
a
moment
to
slip
away
from
the
carts
and
hide
himself
in
the
maze
of
dark
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
palace
there
he
had
shed
the
peasant
costume
leaving
his
black
hashishiyya
garb
and
he
pulled
the
hood
and
mask
over
his
head
but
the
very
thing
that
made
it
easy
for
him
to
get
into
the
palace
with
that
cartload
of
rice
left
him
shocked
and
uneasy
the
monaldeschi
were
preparing
for
a
siege
he
had
seen
screens
against
fire
arrows
being
set
up
on
the
roof
and
householders
in
the
neighborhood
locking
their
doors
and
fleeing
someone
had
warned
the
monaldeschi
when
the
filippeschi
came
tonight
their
hereditary
enemies
would
be
ready
for
them
heart
pounding
he
pondered
what
if
the
filippeschi
called
off
the
attack
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
it
would
not
matter
even
the
expectation
of
a
siege
would
so
distract
the
tartars
protectors
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
at
them
and
he
promised
himself
if
he
came
out
alive
he
would
search
out
and
repay
whoever
had
betrayed
him
he
had
rechecked
his
weapons
the
strangling
cord
the
scorpion
the
tiny
vessel
of
greek
fire
in
its
padded
pouch
the
disk
of
hindustan
and
a
dagger
its
blade
painted
black
after
nightfall
he
would
seek
out
the
tartars
apartment
which
he
knew
was
on
the
third
floor
of
the
palace
where
the
best
rooms
were
in
the
meantime
he
had
hidden
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
behind
a
large
water
cask
he
had
squatted
there
and
waited
taut
as
a
bowstring
to
find
out
whether
the
filippeschi
would
attack
when
he
heard
the
first
battle
shouts
through
the
narrow
embrasures
on
the
ground
floor
he
let
out
a
little
sigh
of
relief
of
course
marco
di
filippeschi
would
go
through
with
the
attack
even
without
surprise
he
was
doubtless
better
prepared
tonight
to
fight
the
monaldeschi
than
ever
before
in
his
life
and
marco
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
once
committed
to
a
course
would
turn
back
even
as
these
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
daoud
had
been
surprised
to
see
the
two
tartars
with
two
of
their
armenian
guards
stride
past
him
of
course
he
thought
de
gobignon
must
have
realized
that
the
tartars
might
be
a
target
and
he
was
moving
them
to
a
safer
place
for
a
moment
the
tartars
had
been
abreast
of
him
two
poisoned
darts
from
the
scorpion
would
do
it
but
just
then
a
dozen
or
so
monaldeschi
archers
crossbows
loaded
and
cranked
back
had
trotted
into
the
kitchen
and
nearby
rooms
and
taken
up
stations
by
the
embrasures
daoud
his
body
aquiver
with
excitement
the
little
crossbow
already
in
his
hands
had
sunk
back
into
hiding
if
he
shot
the
tartars
he
might
have
been
able
to
escape
the
two
armenians
but
so
many
would
certainly
kill
or
worse
capture
him
and
once
they
discovered
who
he
was
sophia
ugolini
all
those
working
with
him
would
swiftly
be
in
the
hands
of
the
franks
seething
with
frustration
he
had
watched
an
armenian
open
a
cellar
trapdoor
the
two
tartars
and
the
two
armenian
guards
descended
out
of
sight
daoud
still
crouched
behind
the
water
cask
then
decided
that
god
had
been
kind
to
him
even
if
he
had
been
denied
this
opportunity
to
kill
them
at
least
he
had
seen
where
the
tartars
were
he
had
sat
in
his
hiding
place
relaxed
but
alert
listening
to
the
monaldeschi
bowmen
shout
encouragement
to
one
another
as
they
fired
on
the
filippeschi
trying
to
cross
the
piazza
the
arrow
slits
were
cut
through
the
thick
walls
in
angled
pairs
so
that
two
archers
side
by
side
would
have
a
full
field
of
fire
after
a
while
daoud
began
to
despair
of
ever
getting
into
the
cellar
several
times
servants
came
running
to
fill
buckets
from
the
cask
to
put
out
fires
in
the
atrium
crouched
in
the
darkness
behind
the
cask
daoud
saw
grouped
around
it
buckets
pots
and
kettles
all
sorts
of
vessels
already
filled
with
water
for
immediate
use
long
after
the
battle
began
a
pageboy
came
running
down
the
stairs
to
the
ground
floor
with
an
order
for
the
archers
to
come
up
to
the
roof
they
left
only
one
man
to
watch
through
the
arrow
slots
his
back
sheathed
in
a
shiny
brown
leather
cuirass
was
turned
toward
daoud
the
noise
of
fighting
from
outside
was
loud
enough
daoud
thought
to
mask
any
sound
he
might
make
he
slipped
from
behind
the
cask
and
picked
up
a
wooden
bucket
full
of
water
carrying
the
bucket
he
stepped
silent
on
his
boots
to
the
cellar
trapdoor
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
crossbowman
he
put
the
bucket
down
and
holding
his
breath
grasped
the
handle
of
the
trapdoor
and
lifted
it
the
archer
moved
as
daoud
crouched
by
the
open
trapdoor
daoud
froze
but
the
man
back
remained
turned
he
was
only
shifting
from
one
arrow
slot
to
the
one
beside
it
to
get
a
view
of
the
piazza
from
a
different
angle
when
the
archer
was
settled
in
his
new
position
daoud
crept
down
the
cellar
stairs
bucket
in
one
hand
and
lowered
the
door
over
his
head
he
watched
the
archer
until
the
slab
of
wood
cut
off
his
view
he
was
in
a
cellar
smelling
of
wine
he
saw
a
crack
of
light
from
under
a
door
and
heard
voices
he
was
about
to
go
and
knock
pretending
to
be
a
with
a
message
when
the
two
armenians
within
opened
the
door
he
would
douse
their
lantern
with
the
water
he
was
carrying
and
then
move
in
on
the
tartars
in
the
dark
just
then
the
trapdoor
above
had
opened
he
hid
behind
the
wine
barrels
as
de
gobignon
the
friar
and
two
more
armenians
came
down
to
join
their
tartar
charges
stones
were
slamming
into
the
walls
in
such
rapid
succession
that
the
building
was
continually
shaking
this
must
be
the
climax
of
the
filippeschi
attack
next
would
come
a
rush
of
all
the
fighting
men
they
would
storm
the
palace
and
either
break
through
or
be
driven
off
probably
daoud
thought
the
attack
would
fail
but
even
so
it
would
give
him
the
opportunity
he
needed
the
two
armenian
guards
held
their
bows
laxly
resting
their
backs
against
the
wall
by
the
door
the
candle
in
the
sconce
was
six
paces
away
from
the
guards
silently
he
lifted
the
bucket
of
water
he
had
brought
down
with
him
and
moved
it
out
in
front
of
the
wine
barrel
rack
so
that
later
he
could
quickly
reach
it
then
he
loaded
the
scorpion
drawing
back
its
string
he
stepped
out
from
behind
the
barrels
aiming
for
the
eye
of
the
nearest
guard
and
fired
the
steel
dowels
snapped
forward
propelling
the
bolt
through
the
eyeball
and
into
the
skull
the
man
collapsed
without
an
outcry
his
body
clad
in
leather
and
steel
hit
the
stone
floor
with
a
crash
the
other
armenian
gave
a
shrill
shout
in
his
native
tongue
he
stared
in
horror
at
daoud
and
his
heavy
compound
bow
was
up
the
iron
arrowhead
pointing
at
daoud
chest
daoud
had
already
taken
the
disk
of
hindustan
out
of
the
flat
pouch
on
the
left
side
of
his
belt
dropping
the
scorpion
into
its
pocket
he
transferred
the
disk
to
his
right
hand
the
disk
was
heavy
by
frankish
weight
it
would
probably
be
half
a
pound
its
center
was
of
strong
flexible
steel
bonded
to
its
edges
was
a
more
brittle
steel
that
would
take
an
edge
sharp
enough
to
slice
a
hair
lengthwise
daoud
scaled
the
disk
at
the
candle
that
rested
in
the
sconce
at
the
door
to
the
pantry
it
sliced
through
the
candle
tip
just
below
the
wick
the
flame
went
out
plunging
the
cellar
into
total
darkness
the
disk
rang
against
the
stone
wall
then
clanged
to
the
floor
trained
hearing
registered
the
place
where
it
fell
the
armenian
bolt
whistled
past
him
and
hit
the
wall
with
a
sharp
crack
voices
from
inside
the
spice
pantry
shouted
questions
that
must
be
the
two
armenians
who
had
first
gone
in
there
with
the
tartars
the
man
outside
answered
and
daoud
could
hear
fear
in
his
voice
de
gobignon
would
not
want
to
open
the
door
to
help
the
armenian
for
fear
of
endangering
the
tartars
somehow
he
had
to
be
made
to
open
the
door
daoud
stood
still
listening
to
the
guard
rapid
heavy
breathing
the
scraping
of
his
boot
soles
on
the
stone
floor
after
a
moment
he
tiptoed
to
the
side
of
the
chamber
retrieved
his
disk
and
dropped
it
into
its
pouch
in
his
tunic
silently
picking
up
the
water
bucket
in
front
of
the
wine
barrel
rack
he
drifted
closer
to
the
guard
thinking
of
smoke
as
the
hashishiyya
had
taught
him
to
make
himself
move
even
more
quietly
he
heard
the
armenian
sling
his
bow
over
his
shoulder
and
the
slithering
of
his
sword
coming
out
of
his
scabbard
daoud
set
the
water
down
and
crept
close
to
the
guard
utterly
silent
listening
for
the
many
small
noises
that
would
tell
him
where
the
man
was
and
how
he
was
standing
breathing
swallowing
and
the
licking
of
lips
the
creak
of
leather
armor
the
rustle
of
cloth
the
clink
of
steel
slowly
and
very
carefully
daoud
reached
out
toward
the
throat
then
with
a
sudden
movement
seized
it
his
thumb
and
fingers
gripping
like
a
falcon
talons
his
action
had
the
desired
effect
the
armenian
screamed
forcing
air
through
his
constricted
throat
again
and
again
he
tried
to
slash
at
daoud
arm
but
missed
with
his
free
hand
daoud
grabbed
the
guard
wrist
and
gave
it
a
sharp
turn
he
let
go
of
his
opponent
throat
and
used
both
hands
to
force
his
sword
arm
down
he
straightened
the
arm
out
and
brought
his
knee
down
hard
on
the
elbow
throwing
all
his
weight
on
it
the
guard
screamed
with
pain
and
his
sword
clattered
to
the
floor
daoud
kicked
it
off
into
the
darkness
then
danced
away
the
armenian
fell
back
against
the
spice
pantry
door
groaning
in
pain
and
fear
daoud
heard
muffled
cries
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
they
demanded
to
know
what
was
happening
they
begged
to
know
what
was
happening
the
armenian
agonized
voice
cried
out
to
them
also
begging
to
be
let
in
to
be
saved
from
the
man
who
was
killing
him
in
the
blackness
daoud
readied
himself
finding
the
water
bucket
again
in
the
dark
and
picking
it
up
he
held
it
with
both
hands
by
the
handle
and
by
the
base
he
would
have
only
a
little
time
to
use
it
before
they
found
some
way
to
stop
him
he
heard
the
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
slide
back
the
iron
bolt
it
was
the
only
thing
they
could
do
daoud
thought
the
other
armenians
could
not
bear
to
keep
the
door
shut
and
let
their
comrade
die
the
wooden
door
swung
inward
light
sprang
out
into
the
cellar
from
only
one
lantern
but
dazzled
daoud
because
he
had
been
in
complete
darkness
since
he
put
out
the
candle
he
now
saw
the
man
he
had
been
fighting
a
squat
man
with
a
thick
black
mustache
tears
of
pain
running
from
his
eyes
his
right
arm
dangling
limply
in
the
fraction
of
an
instant
before
his
enemies
saw
him
daoud
took
in
everything
in
the
spice
pantry
de
gobignon
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
holding
his
beautiful
scimitar
out
before
him
in
his
right
hand
with
his
left
hand
he
reached
for
the
wounded
guard
to
pull
him
in
on
either
side
of
him
were
the
other
two
armenians
bows
drawn
ready
to
fire
beyond
them
daoud
glimpsed
the
tartars
also
with
bows
loaded
and
pulled
and
the
old
priest
but
the
most
important
thing
in
there
was
that
small
weak
flame
flickering
behind
sheets
of
horn
in
a
lantern
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
daoud
stepped
as
close
as
he
dared
into
the
doorway
and
raised
the
bucket
high
heaving
the
water
in
a
stream
at
the
table
he
heard
a
bow
thrum
and
an
arrow
whistle
past
his
shoulder
his
eyes
met
de
gobignon
just
as
the
light
went
out
like
a
stone
fired
from
a
catapult
he
hurled
himself
crouching
low
into
the
pantry
landing
silently
inside
the
room
he
changed
direction
once
twice
a
third
time
ending
up
at
the
door
he
slammed
it
shut
and
bolted
it
they
should
all
now
be
thoroughly
confused
in
total
darkness
seeing
with
his
senses
of
hearing
smell
and
touch
he
began
to
stalk
the
tartars
xliv
simon
heard
the
thick
door
slam
and
the
iron
bolt
driven
into
place
he
stood
in
a
blackness
darker
than
any
night
outdoors
would
have
been
his
scimitar
heavy
and
invisible
in
his
hand
it
was
all
he
had
against
an
enemy
who
was
also
invisible
he
felt
death
rushing
upon
him
out
of
the
darkness
except
for
the
occasional
vibrations
of
a
rock
hitting
the
palace
wall
all
sounds
of
battle
were
blocked
out
of
the
spice
pantry
in
the
deep
silence
simon
heartbeat
thundered
in
his
ears
like
a
kettledrum
was
my
stupidity
that
opened
the
door
to
he
had
caught
only
a
glimpse
of
the
enemy
all
in
black
from
head
to
foot
eyes
shining
through
oval
holes
in
his
mask
truly
like
a
devil
the
stalker
had
deliberately
doused
the
light
which
must
mean
he
could
find
his
victims
in
the
dark
simon
body
went
from
hot
to
cold
while
he
stood
here
helplessly
the
men
with
him
could
be
dying
he
tried
to
force
himself
to
think
but
his
mind
was
motionless
as
a
stone
all
around
simon
was
confusion
he
heard
grigor
the
guard
who
had
staggered
into
the
room
just
before
the
light
went
out
moaning
with
pain
he
heard
men
stumbling
about
they
kept
bumping
into
him
he
lowered
his
scimitar
to
avoid
stabbing
someone
by
accident
a
crash
made
simon
jump
that
was
the
lantern
smashed
probably
by
the
man
in
black
so
that
no
one
could
relight
it
next
he
would
start
killing
them
one
by
one
if
only
i
had
some
light
just
a
the
odors
of
the
precious
spices
the
monaldeschi
stored
in
this
pantry
pervaded
the
air
saffron
cardamom
pepper
cloves
ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
when
simon
had
first
entered
the
spice
pantry
a
short
time
ago
it
had
seemed
a
pleasant
enough
smell
now
it
was
making
him
sick
was
there
still
a
lighted
candle
in
the
cellar
outside
the
door
he
shouted
get
the
door
open
friar
mathieu
repeated
his
command
in
the
armenian
tongue
he
heard
a
scraping
as
of
someone
pulling
on
the
heavy
bolt
that
held
the
door
shut
then
a
thud
and
a
choking
cry
of
pain
then
a
sound
like
a
heavy
sack
being
dropped
simon
groaned
inwardly
he
could
picture
what
had
happened
now
the
door
was
held
shut
not
just
by
a
bolt
but
by
a
dead
body
he
felt
ice
cold
but
sweat
trickled
under
his
mail
the
blackness
was
thick
a
blanket
smothering
him
the
smells
of
the
spices
were
cloying
dizzying
his
stomach
felt
queasy
flint
and
tinder
simon
shouted
and
friar
mathieu
repeated
his
words
for
the
armenians
and
tartars
everything
he
said
had
to
be
translated
the
delay
was
maddening
and
simon
realized
anyone
who
tried
to
strike
a
light
would
make
himself
the
enemy
next
target
god
blood
even
by
answering
friar
mathieu
the
tartars
would
give
away
their
location
to
the
stalker
the
man
in
black
must
be
able
to
find
his
victims
by
listening
for
them
so
if
sound
would
make
them
visible
then
the
only
way
to
thwart
this
demon
would
be
by
silence
and
even
now
men
were
starting
to
answer
simon
call
for
flint
silence
he
shouted
his
voice
sounded
shrill
in
his
ears
like
a
frightened
boy
for
a
moment
there
was
no
sound
in
the
blackness
he
finds
us
by
the
sounds
we
make
simon
said
everyone
remain
still
and
we
will
hear
him
when
he
moves
as
friar
mathieu
translated
simon
realized
that
either
he
or
friar
mathieu
could
be
the
next
victim
the
stalker
would
want
to
kill
the
franciscan
so
simon
could
not
communicate
with
the
others
and
one
armenian
was
badly
hurt
one
was
probably
dead
outside
and
one
dead
by
the
door
left
able
to
fight
were
only
simon
the
tartars
and
one
armenian
guard
they
had
swords
and
bows
but
the
bows
would
just
be
encumbrances
in
this
total
blackness
in
minutes
the
ambassadors
could
be
dead
simon
felt
terrified
drowning
in
darkness
almost
overcome
with
helplessness
must
make
him
come
to
the
thought
frightened
simon
even
more
he
did
not
know
whether
he
would
have
the
courage
to
act
on
it
what
weapons
did
the
stalker
have
in
the
glimpse
simon
had
of
him
before
he
put
the
candle
out
the
man
in
black
had
seemed
to
be
his
weapons
must
be
small
ones
that
could
kill
but
might
not
be
quite
so
dangerous
to
a
man
in
mail
everyone
remain
still
simon
said
loudly
you
will
hear
me
moving
steadily
about
if
you
hear
someone
else
as
well
it
is
the
enemy
he
racked
his
brain
to
remember
the
size
and
shape
of
the
room
holding
his
sword
low
he
put
his
hand
up
before
his
face
and
forced
himself
to
take
one
step
then
another
an
attack
might
come
from
any
direction
the
trembling
of
his
hands
and
knees
made
his
mail
jingle
faintly
the
mailed
glove
dangling
from
his
wrist
rattled
as
his
bare
hand
encountered
a
man
face
the
man
gasped
and
pulled
away
moi
said
simon
just
to
let
the
man
hear
his
voice
knowing
it
did
not
matter
what
language
he
spoke
he
was
not
afraid
of
calling
attention
to
himself
he
wanted
the
stalker
to
come
for
him
and
he
wanted
those
on
his
side
to
know
where
he
was
so
they
would
not
attack
him
by
mistake
the
face
he
felt
was
hot
sweaty
with
a
bushy
mustache
one
of
the
armenians
the
killer
had
been
masked
simon
patted
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
moved
on
he
doubted
that
he
could
find
the
man
in
black
this
way
if
the
stalker
were
as
skilled
at
moving
about
in
the
dark
as
he
seemed
to
be
he
could
easily
evade
simon
the
tartars
seemed
to
have
understood
the
peril
they
were
in
they
had
been
silent
now
for
a
long
time
the
thought
struck
him
like
ice
between
his
shoulder
blades
what
if
the
killer
had
already
gotten
to
them
and
they
were
silent
because
they
were
dead
he
wanted
to
call
out
to
them
or
to
friar
mathieu
to
be
sure
they
were
all
right
he
suppressed
the
urge
and
reached
out
for
another
face
this
time
he
felt
a
beard
it
was
long
and
full
friar
mathieu
moi
simon
said
again
and
a
hand
reached
up
and
squeezed
his
reassuringly
the
next
face
was
hard
bony
there
was
a
mustache
that
his
fingers
followed
long
below
the
mouth
the
beard
was
thin
sprouting
from
the
chin
only
one
of
the
tartars
simon
felt
the
face
move
under
his
touch
thank
god
the
man
was
alive
he
reached
beyond
the
tartar
and
felt
a
shoulder
this
must
be
the
other
tartar
but
no
the
shoulder
was
high
as
high
as
the
tartar
head
just
as
he
was
about
to
jump
back
he
felt
something
brush
over
his
hair
a
cord
was
around
his
neck
it
jerked
tight
with
such
force
that
simon
breath
was
instantly
cut
off
pain
circled
his
neck
like
a
band
of
fire
his
scream
forced
its
way
through
his
throat
as
a
grunt
as
the
cord
tightened
still
more
he
could
feel
the
blood
in
his
head
pressing
out
against
his
temples
and
eyeballs
he
felt
as
if
nails
were
being
driven
into
his
head
he
had
his
scimitar
he
raised
it
and
drove
it
back
over
his
right
shoulder
it
went
through
empty
air
the
killer
had
felt
it
coming
and
ducked
out
of
the
way
but
for
a
moment
the
cord
cutting
into
throat
let
up
just
a
bit
he
heard
voices
all
around
him
the
others
knew
what
was
happening
they
stumbled
about
but
they
could
not
see
to
reach
him
he
felt
himself
being
dragged
backward
pulled
away
from
his
comrades
the
cord
was
digging
into
his
windpipe
harder
and
harder
in
a
moment
his
mind
would
go
black
he
would
not
even
know
when
he
died
he
fought
his
terror
knowing
that
if
he
yielded
to
it
he
would
surely
die
he
live
he
see
sophia
again
he
tried
to
lean
forward
to
bend
his
knees
to
find
some
purchase
on
the
stone
for
his
feet
still
the
attacker
pulled
him
simon
felt
he
had
only
a
child
strength
compared
to
the
man
in
black
dizzily
simon
remembered
games
when
he
had
been
a
page
at
the
royal
palace
one
side
lets
go
everyone
on
the
other
side
falls
with
his
last
bit
of
consciousness
simon
squeezed
his
whole
body
into
a
crouch
then
sprang
up
and
backward
like
a
bow
released
his
weight
and
the
attacker
momentum
threw
them
both
backward
they
crashed
together
against
shelving
and
simon
heard
porcelain
shatter
clouds
of
ground
spices
enveloped
them
and
they
fell
sideways
to
the
floor
simon
on
top
of
his
attacker
he
heard
a
gasp
as
the
man
breath
was
knocked
out
of
him
and
now
could
breathe
he
choked
on
air
saturated
with
cinnamon
and
curry
but
the
cord
was
loose
the
fall
had
knocked
his
scimitar
out
of
his
hand
anguished
he
felt
for
it
but
it
was
as
if
it
had
fallen
into
a
well
simon
where
are
you
friar
mathieu
shouted
ah
ah
simon
let
his
breath
out
and
sucked
it
in
gasping
he
wanted
to
cry
for
help
but
he
could
not
use
his
voice
his
body
shook
with
terror
and
he
felt
the
body
under
him
moving
with
swift
and
terrible
power
the
cord
snapped
tight
again
but
not
before
simon
got
his
right
hand
under
it
the
killer
gave
a
vicious
jerk
on
the
thin
cord
and
it
felt
as
if
it
might
slice
through
his
fingers
but
simon
pushed
against
it
with
all
the
strength
in
his
right
arm
and
loosened
the
cord
enough
to
be
able
to
pull
air
into
his
throat
he
worked
his
other
hand
under
it
his
shout
burst
from
his
throat
help
me
here
here
boots
pounded
toward
him
he
felt
men
around
him
he
heard
them
coughing
and
sneezing
from
the
spices
that
filled
the
air
a
sword
poked
him
through
his
mail
under
me
stab
stab
you
can
not
hurt
me
the
cord
went
lax
the
attacker
had
let
go
of
it
simon
drew
air
frantically
through
his
tortured
windpipe
before
he
could
get
to
his
feet
an
arm
hard
as
if
clad
in
mail
whipped
around
his
neck
clamping
him
to
his
enemy
he
felt
the
edge
of
a
dagger
at
his
throat
simon
could
hear
the
devil
breathing
right
by
his
ear
frantic
he
jerked
his
head
forward
and
drove
it
back
ramming
the
back
of
his
head
into
his
attacker
face
slamming
the
enemy
head
against
the
stone
floor
simon
felt
stunned
but
the
other
must
have
been
stunned
too
he
heard
a
whispered
gasp
can
the
devil
be
so
silent
he
heard
men
speaking
above
him
and
feet
shuffling
around
him
but
despite
his
command
no
swords
were
jabbing
downward
they
were
afraid
of
stabbing
him
even
though
he
was
wearing
mail
he
arched
his
body
and
brought
all
his
mailed
weight
down
hard
he
felt
the
edge
of
the
enemy
dagger
scrape
across
the
chain
around
his
neck
a
bolt
of
terror
shot
through
him
if
not
for
that
medallion
he
would
be
bleeding
to
death
right
now
simon
thrust
his
elbows
into
his
enemy
ribs
the
gasp
was
louder
this
time
and
with
a
violent
heave
he
freed
himself
he
twisted
over
arms
reaching
to
wrap
around
his
enemy
have
to
pin
him
down
i
can
not
let
him
get
loose
in
this
room
but
the
knees
below
him
drew
up
and
the
feet
kicked
against
him
throwing
him
back
right
in
front
of
me
simon
cried
get
him
and
then
he
realized
despairingly
that
none
of
the
armed
men
on
his
side
could
understand
him
and
no
one
it
seemed
had
flint
and
steel
to
strike
a
light
he
knew
he
was
carrying
none
such
a
simple
thing
yet
tonight
its
lack
might
be
his
death
his
foot
kicked
something
that
rang
against
the
stone
floor
his
sword
he
swooped
down
on
it
seized
it
and
thrust
blindly
straight
ahead
the
point
struck
a
stone
wall
and
he
felt
the
blade
bend
he
checked
his
thrust
just
in
time
to
keep
the
scimitar
from
breaking
he
heard
a
movement
to
his
left
and
stabbed
again
again
he
struck
blank
stone
devil
is
somewhere
in
this
part
of
the
the
door
simon
shouted
mathieu
get
the
door
open
he
heard
the
iron
bolt
shoved
back
the
creak
of
hinges
the
scrape
of
a
body
being
pushed
aside
but
the
blackness
remained
absolute
must
have
put
out
the
candle
in
the
cellar
before
he
broke
in
simon
heard
running
footsteps
outside
the
spice
pantry
sandals
slapping
up
wooden
stairs
the
creaking
of
the
trapdoor
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
steps
and
then
there
was
light
gray
faint
but
after
what
seemed
like
hours
spent
in
utter
darkness
it
was
as
if
the
sun
had
suddenly
risen
bless
you
scimitar
at
the
ready
simon
swept
the
room
with
his
gaze
a
shadowy
figure
stood
halfway
along
one
of
the
side
walls
holding
something
out
before
him
in
both
hands
a
miniature
crossbow
a
thing
simon
turned
to
see
where
it
was
pointed
he
saw
john
chagan
on
the
other
side
of
the
pantry
facing
the
killer
he
heard
a
snap
but
grigor
the
armenian
who
had
been
hurt
outside
the
spice
pantry
had
stepped
between
john
and
the
crossbow
and
he
took
the
bolt
in
his
leather
cuirass
simon
felt
his
mind
moving
much
more
slowly
than
things
were
happening
trying
to
grasp
it
all
grigor
eyes
opened
wide
perhaps
simon
thought
he
had
expected
that
a
bolt
from
such
a
little
bow
would
merely
bounce
off
his
hardened
leather
armor
or
perhaps
he
knew
that
it
would
kill
him
in
the
semidarkness
simon
could
not
see
the
hole
in
the
cuirass
but
grigor
hand
went
to
his
chest
and
then
he
toppled
over
the
tartar
philip
had
picked
up
a
bow
from
the
floor
and
so
had
the
other
armenian
both
raised
their
weapons
toward
the
man
in
black
we
have
him
cornered
and
in
a
moment
i
will
rip
off
his
mask
and
know
who
he
the
stalker
hand
flashed
upward
and
he
threw
a
tiny
round
object
into
the
pile
of
broken
wooden
shelves
on
the
floor
a
roar
deafened
simon
and
a
blaze
of
white
flame
blinded
him
the
wooden
shelves
were
afire
the
flames
feeding
on
the
powdered
spices
that
floated
in
the
air
heat
seared
simon
face
of
god
he
truly
is
a
devil
by
the
time
simon
and
the
others
had
recovered
from
the
burst
of
fire
the
enemy
was
out
the
door
and
running
for
the
cellar
stairs
simon
cried
out
wordlessly
in
frustrated
rage
he
must
not
get
away
not
after
all
he
had
done
to
them
as
the
man
in
black
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
philip
stepped
into
the
doorway
drew
his
bow
as
calmly
and
carefully
as
if
he
were
hunting
and
loosed
an
arrow
the
man
in
black
jerked
to
a
stop
simon
could
see
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
protruding
from
his
right
thigh
the
man
reached
down
and
with
a
sudden
movement
snapped
away
the
arrow
shaft
he
drew
a
dagger
with
a
strange
blade
that
did
not
gleam
it
was
dead
black
he
raced
on
up
the
stairs
limping
but
with
inhuman
strength
and
speed
two
more
arrows
flew
at
him
but
missed
clattering
against
the
cellar
walls
friar
mathieu
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
held
his
arms
out
a
lit
white
candle
in
one
hand
blocking
the
stalker
path
the
man
came
at
him
with
the
dagger
no
simon
screamed
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
the
man
in
black
threw
friar
mathieu
down
from
the
banisterless
stairs
the
old
priest
fell
six
feet
to
the
cellar
floor
struck
with
a
loud
sickening
thump
and
lay
there
still
and
the
enemy
was
gone
by
the
time
simon
and
the
others
had
climbed
up
to
the
kitchen
the
man
in
black
had
vanished
into
the
maze
of
dark
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
the
palace
simon
wild
with
rage
and
grief
forced
himself
to
think
he
was
alive
god
be
thanked
and
he
had
saved
the
tartars
but
just
for
this
moment
the
man
in
black
seemingly
routed
might
renew
his
attack
at
any
time
friar
mathieu
dear
god
do
let
him
be
dead
what
was
the
creature
simon
had
fought
in
the
darkness
christian
saracen
or
as
his
most
frightening
imaginings
hinted
a
being
from
hell
itself
clearly
it
was
not
some
filippeschi
bravo
who
had
somehow
broken
through
the
palace
defenses
simon
inspiration
on
the
battlements
had
been
right
the
filippeschi
attack
had
been
only
a
diversion
if
a
demon
of
this
sort
opposed
the
alliance
simon
felt
more
than
ever
determined
that
the
alliance
must
succeed
this
was
the
hidden
enemy
whose
presence
he
had
sensed
since
coming
to
orvieto
the
force
determined
to
prevent
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
the
one
who
had
incited
orvieto
people
against
the
tartars
when
they
first
came
who
had
set
that
poor
devil
of
a
heretic
to
draw
his
dagger
against
them
in
the
cathedral
alain
murderer
stalker
enemy
killer
devil
hatred
blazed
up
within
simon
if
only
he
could
have
killed
the
man
in
black
or
caught
him
before
he
escaped
now
he
must
guard
against
an
enemy
as
evil
as
satan
an
enemy
powerful
enough
to
throw
an
army
against
a
fortified
palace
subtle
enough
to
reach
into
an
impregnable
chamber
and
strike
at
his
intended
victims
a
being
whose
strength
and
skills
made
him
seem
more
than
human
cruel
and
pitiless
ready
to
murder
anyone
who
stood
in
his
way
it
was
as
certain
as
the
judgment
of
god
that
they
would
fight
again
