preface
this
translation
was
undertaken
in
the
belief
that
there
are
many
people
who
feel
more
than
a
merely
superficial
interest
in
ethical
research
but
who
may
not
read
german
with
sufficient
ease
to
make
them
care
to
take
up
the
original
the
present
essay
is
one
of
the
most
important
contributions
to
ethics
since
the
time
of
kant
and
as
such
is
indispensable
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
subject
moreover
from
whatever
point
of
view
it
be
regarded
whether
the
reader
find
when
he
closes
the
book
that
his
conviction
harmonises
with
the
conclusion
reached
or
not
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
any
treatise
on
moral
science
more
calculated
to
stimulate
thought
and
lift
it
out
of
infantile
imitation
of
some
prescribed
pattern
the
believer
in
the
kantian
or
any
other
basis
of
ethics
could
hardly
measure
the
strength
or
the
weakness
of
his
own
position
more
surely
than
by
comparing
it
with
the
schopenhauerian
while
he
who
is
yet
in
search
of
a
foundation
will
find
much
in
the
following
pages
to
claim
his
attention
those
acquainted
with
the
luminous
imagery
the
subtle
irony
the
brusque
and
penetrating
vigour
of
the
german
will
doubtless
admit
that
it
is
no
easy
task
to
reduce
schopenhauer
to
adequate
english
prose
and
if
this
has
been
attempted
by
the
present
writer
no
one
can
be
more
conscious
than
he
of
the
manifold
shortcomings
discoverable
but
such
as
it
is
the

in
the
danish
royal
society
of
sciences
propounded
as
subject
for
a
prize
competition
the
question
with
which
this
treatise
opens
and
schopenhauer
who
was
glad
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
becoming
better
known
prepared
and
sent
to
copenhagen
the
earliest
form
of
the
basis
of
morality
in
january
the
work
was
pronounced
unsuccessful
though
there
was
no
other
candidate
in
september
of
the
same
year
it
was
published
by
the
author
with
only
a
few
unimportant
additions
but
preceded
by
a
long
introduction
which
cast
in
the
form
of
an
exceedingly
caustic
philippic
is
in
its
way
a
masterpiece
in
only
a
month
before
schopenhauer
death
the
second
edition
was
printed
with
many
enlargements
and
insertions
the
short
preface
dated
august
being
one
of
the
last
things
he
wrote
the
reason
why
the
prize
was
withheld
is
not
far
to
seek
and
need
not
detain
us
at
that
time
the
philosophical
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
hegel
and
to
a
certain
extent
with
fichte
hence
it
is
easy
to
imagine
with
what
ruffled
not
to
say
scandalised
feelings
the
academy
must
have
risen
from
its
perusal
of
the
work
moreover
putting
hegel
and
fichte
out
of
the
question
the
position
advanced
was
in
so
new
indeed
so
paradoxical
as
schopenhauer
himself
admits
there
is
at
times
such
an
aggressiveness
in
the
style
the
whole
essay
is
so
much
more
calculated
to
startle
than
to
conciliate
that
we
can
not
feel
much
surprise
at
the
official
decision
in
the
judgment
published
by
the
society
three
reasons
are
given
for
its
unfavourable
attitude
the
second
is
declared
to
be
not
only
dissatisfaction
with
the
mode
of
discussion
disserendi
but
also
inability
to
see
that
schopenhauer
proves
his
case
as
the
third
is
alleged
the
unseemly
language
employed
in
connection
with
certain
hegel
and
fichte
these
two
objections
are
of
course
in
themselves
perfectly
legitimate
and
how
far
the
academy
was
right
or
wrong
may
be
left
for
the
reader
to
determine
but
the
first
reason
stated
is
of
a
different
kind
and
affords
as
neat
an
instance
of
proceeding
as
can
well
be
found
it
is
true
that
the
question
is
worded
vaguely
enough
but
if
it
means
anything
it
asks
where
the
moralis
fons
et
the
foundation
of
moral
science
is
to
be
sought
for
where
it
is
to
be
found
turning
to
the
judgment
we
read
he
schopenhauer
has
omitted
to
deal
with
the
essential
part
of
the
question
apparently
thinking
that
he
was
required
to
establish
some
fundamental
principle
of
ethics
which
he
was
required
to
do
unless
the
society
latin
is
borrowed
from
and
then
it
goes
on
to
declare
that
he
treated
as
secondary
indeed
as
an
supererogationis
the
very
thing
which
the
academy
intended
should
occupy
the
first
place
namely
the
connection
between
metaphysics
and
ethics
but
the
et
ethicae
so
far
from
being
formulated
in
the
question
as
the
chief
point
to
be
considered
is
not
even
mentioned
the
society
thus
denies
having
asked
what
it
actually
did
ask
while
the
discussion
which
it
asserts
was
specially
indicated
is
not
suggested
by
a
single
word
its
embarrassment
is
sufficiently
shown
by
this
unworthy
shifting
to
enlarge
upon
which
would
here
be
out
of
place
it
is
not
intended
to
offer
any
criticism
either
on
schopenhauer
main
position
in
this
essay
or
on
the
various
involved
the
reader
is
supposed
to
be
accurately
acquainted
with
the
fundamentals
of
his
philosophy
as
contained
in
welt
als
wille
und
and
is
invited
to
be
the
critic
himself
but
perhaps
a
few
remarks
on
the
structure
and
general
trend
of
the
work
may
not
be
amiss
after
preliminary
considerations
partly
to
show
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
partly
to
clear
the
ground
part
i
the
treatise
opens
with
a
searching
critique
of
kant
ethical
basis
of
the
leading
principle
of
his
system
and
of
its
derived
forms
part
chapters
schopenhauer
conclusion
is
that
the
categorical
imperative
is
a
very
cleverly
woven
web
yet
in
reality
nothing
but
the
old
theological
basis
in
disguise
the
latter
being
the
indispensable
if
invisible
clothes
peg
for
the
former
and
that
kant
de
of
deducing
his
moral
theology
from
ethics
is
like
inverting
a
pyramid
the
theory
of
conscience
is
next
discussed
chapter
the
element
which
kant
introduced
under
the
highly
dramatic
form
of
a
court
of
justice
holding
secret
session
in
the
breast
is
examined
and
eliminated
and
conscience
is
defined
as
the
knowledge
that
we
have
of
ourselves
through
our
acts
but
if
so
far
the
result
obtained
is
distinctly
unfavourable
to
kant
schopenhauer
is
glad
to
agree
with
him
on
one
point
namely
the
theory
of
freedom
to
a
brief
notice
of
which
he
now
passes
chapter
he
points
out
that
the
solution
of
this
question
is
found
in
the
doctrine
of
the
of
liberty
and
necessity
according
to
which
the
basis
of
our
nature
the
intelligible
character
that
lies
outside
the
forms
attaching
to
phaenomena
namely
time
space
and
causality
is
transcendentally
free
while
the
empirical
character
together
with
the
whole
person
being
as
a
phaenomenon
the
transient
objectivation
of
the
intelligible
character
under
the
laws
of
the
is
strictly
determined
part
ii
closes
with
a
sufficiently
amusing
examination
of
fichte
chapter
his
proper
function
is
shown
to
be
that
of
a
magnifying
glass
for
kant
by
means
of
this
powerful
human
lens
we
can
see
the
monstrous
shapes
into
which
the
kantian
pet
creations
are
capable
of
developing
thus
we
find
the
categorical
imperative
become
a
despotic
imperative
the
absolute
ought
grown
into
a
fathomless
inscrutable
etc
with
part
iii
we
reach
the
positive
part
of
the
work
schopenhauer
begins
chapter
i
by
emphasising
the
necessity
of
finding
a
basis
for
ethics
that
appeals
not
to
the
intellect
but
to
the
intuitive
perception
such
he
says
can
never
be
any
artificial
formula
which
surely
crumbles
to
powder
beneath
the
rough
touch
of
real
life
rather
must
it
be
something
springing
out
of
the
heart
of
things
and
therefore
lying
at
the
root
of
man
nature
but
is
there
he
asks
chapter
ii
after
all
such
a
thing
as
natural
morality
is
anything
good
ever
done
absolutely
without
an
egoistic
motive
the
conclusion
arrived
at
is
that
although
much
may
be
and
has
been
at
all
times
said
in
favour
of
the
sceptical
view
and
although
this
view
is
in
fact
true
as
regards
the
greater
number
of
apparently
unselfish
acts
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
truly
moral
conduct
does
occur
that
deeds
of
justice
and
are
occasionally
performed
without
the
smallest
hope
of
reward
or
fear
of
punishment
involved
in
their
omission
the
last
paragraph
of
chis
chapter
is
important
because
it
puts
in
the
clearest
light
what
according
to
schopenhauer
is
the
end
of
ethics
its
aim
he
says
is
to
treat
of
that
which
people
to
for
ought
has
no
place
except
in
theological
morals
whether
explicit
or
implicit
but
to
point
out
all
the
varied
moral
lines
of
human
conduct
to
explain
them
and
to
trace
them
to
their
ultimate
source
this
definition
which
assigns
no
educative
function
to
ethics
strictly
agrees
with
the
doctrine
of
the
unchangeableness
of
character
chapter
ix
of
this
part
our
philosopher
then
proceeds
to
show
chapter
iii
that
there
are
two
fundamental
antimoral
incentives
in
man
nature
egoism
and
malice
be
it
however
here
remarked
that
a
still
simpler
classification
would
reduce
these
two
to
one
malice
may
well
be
regarded
as
nothing
but
egoism
carried
to
its
extreme
developed
to
gigantic
proportions
it
is
a
distinct
source
of
gratification
to
certain
natures
to
witness
the
suffering
of
another
because
a
diminution
of
the
latter
capacity
for
action
whether
effected
by
itself
or
not
is
regarded
by
an
ego
of
this
kind
as
an
increase
of
its
own
power
to
do
as
it
likes
as
an
enhancement
of
its
own
glorification
in
chapter
iv
the
ultimate
test
of
truly
moral
conduct
is
explained
to
be
the
absence
of
all
egoistic
motivation
and
in
chapters
by
a
process
of
careful
reasoning
every
human
act
is
traced
to
one
of
three
original
springs
namely
egoism
malice
and
compassion
or
to
a
combination
of
and
or
and
of
these
the
third
is
shown
to
be
the
only
to
the
first
and
second
and
in
fact
the
sole
source
of
the
two
cardinal
virtues
justice
and
which
are
explained
as
the
manifestation
of
compassion
in
a
lower
and
a
higher
degree
respectively
in
the
course
of
the
demonstration
the
question
as
to
how
far
a
lie
is
legitimate
comes
incidentally
under
discussion
as
also
the
theory
of
duty
duties
being
defined
as
actions
the
simple
omission
of
which
constitutes
a
wrong
cf
part
chapter
iii
the
position
now
reached
namely
that
compassion
is
the
one
and
only
fount
of
true
morality
because
it
is
the
sole
source
of
action
is
says
schopenhauer
a
strange
paradox
hence
the
testimony
of
experience
and
of
universal
human
sentiment
is
appealed
to
in
confirmation
of
it
under
nine
different
considerations
chapter
they
are
as
follows
an
imaginary
case
cruelty
which
means
the
maximum
deficiency
in
compassion
is
the
mark
of
the
deepest
moral
depravity
therefore
the
real
moral
incentive
must
be
compassion
compassion
is
the
only
thoroughly
effective
spring
of
moral
conduct
limitless
compassion
for
all
living
things
is
the
surest
and
most
certain
token
of
a
really
good
man
the
evidence
of
separate
matters
of
detail
compassion
is
more
easily
discerned
in
its
higher
power
it
is
more
obviously
the
root
of
than
of
justice
compassion
does
not
stop
short
with
men
it
includes
all
living
beings
considered
simply
from
the
empirical
point
of
view
compassion
is
the
best
possible
antidote
to
egoism
no
less
than
the
most
soothing
balsam
for
the
world
inevitable
suffering
rousseau
testimony
is
quoted
as
well
as
passages
from
the
pausanias
lucian
stobaeus
and
lessing
and
reference
is
made
to
chinese
ethics
and
hindu
customs
part
iii
closes
chapter
ix
with
an
inquiry
into
the
ethical
difference
of
character
the
theory
that
this
difference
is
innate
and
immutable
is
supported
by
numerous
extracts
from
various
writers
of
all
periods
and
illustrated
in
many
ways
but
all
the
evidence
accumulated
hardly
amounts
to
more
than
so
many
hints
and
indications
and
the
matter
says
schopenhauer
was
only
satisfactorily
explained
by
kant
doctrine
of
the
intelligible
and
empirical
character
cf
part
chapter
viii
according
to
this
the
ethical
difference
between
man
and
man
is
an
original
and
ultimate
datum
caused
by
the
transcendentally
free
act
of
the
intelligible
character
that
is
the
will
as
thing
in
itself
outside
phaenomena
the
empirical
character
being
so
to
say
the
reflection
of
the
intelligible
mirrored
through
the
functions
of
our
perceptive
faculty
namely
time
space
and
causality
hence
the
former
while
manifested
in
plurality
and
difference
of
acts
yet
necessarily
always
wears
the
same
unchangeable
features
inasmuch
as
it
is
but
the
of
the
unity
behind
if
the
reader
asks
why
the
essential
constitution
of
the
thing
in
itself
underlying
the
phaenomenon
is
so
enormously
different
in
different
individuals
it
can
only
be
said
that
our
intellect
conditioned
as
it
is
by
the
laws
of
causality
space
and
time
has
no
power
to
deal
with
noumena
its
range
being
limited
to
phaenomena
and
that
therefore
this
question
is
one
of
those
which
have
no
conceivable
answer
cf
welt
als
wille
und
vol
chap
epiphilosophie
the
discussion
now
terminated
points
to
the
conclusion
that
or
perhaps
of
what
we
do
is
more
or
less
due
to
egoism
conscious
or
unconscious
while
acts
of
real
morality
that
is
of
unselfish
justice
and
pure
admitting
that
they
occur
are
to
be
attributed
to
compassion
that
is
the
sense
of
another
nor
is
the
principle
of
altruism
new
it
is
as
old
as
man
himself
all
the
rare
and
sensitive
natures
in
the
world
have
given
utterance
to
it
each
in
his
own
way
like
a
golden
thread
it
runs
from
the
earliest
indian
literature
to
george
eliot
to
tolstoï
and
every
day
for
unnumbered
ages
from
youth
to
eld
from
sire
to
son
in
lowly
dwellings
and
in
palaces
it
has
been
unawares
translated
into
action
and
if
we
may
forecast
the
future
from
the
past
it
would
appear
that
in
all
the
stormy
seas
yet
to
be
traversed
by
the
human
race
before
its
little
day
is
spent
compassion
will
ever
be
the
surest
guide
to
better
things
and
that
the
light
of
knowledge
illuminating
the
path
whereby
the
world
may
become
relatively
happier
will
always
vary
directly

susceptibility
to

promptings

than

the
metaphysical
explanation
of
compassion
which
for
those
who
still
think
that
metaphysics
is
something
more
than
a
of
the
past
like
alchemy
or
astrology
will
have
special
interest
it
should
be
observed
as
is
pointed
out
in
our
author
preface
to
the
first
edition
that
the
line
of
thought
followed
does
not
belong
to
any
particular
metaphysical
school
but
to
many
being
in
fact
a
principle
at
the
root
of
the
oldest
systems
in
the
world
and
traceable
in
one
form
or
another
down
to
kant
as
in
the
dawn
of
history
it
was
our
own
aryan
forefathers
who
divined
with
subtle
intuition
the
ideality
of
time
and
space
so
in
the
fulness
of
the
ages
it
was
reserved
for
another
aryan
of
scotch
descent
to
formulate
the
same
in
exact
language
now
by
the
vast
majority
of
men
the
ideality
of
the
is
undoubtedly
either
not
consciously
realised
at
all
or
else
but
dimly
perceived
under
the
form
of
allegories
and
mythologies
yet
if
this
theory
be
true
if
individuation
be
only
a
phaenomenon
depending
on
the
subjectivity
of
time
and
space
then
compassion
and
its
external
expression
the
that
is
greater
than
faith
and
hope
receive
their
final
explanation
and
every
every
word
that
vibrates
in
harmony
with
the
inspired
rhapsody
of
corinthians
xiii
every
act
of
genuine
justice
or
of
true
done
by
man
to
man
as
well
as
the
uplifting
emotion
which
stirs
our
hearts
at
the
sight
of
such
conduct
all
these
things
become
fraught
with
a
new
and
luminous
significance
the
secret
writing
is
interpreted
its
deepest
meaning
disclosed
moreover
the
thou
shalt
and
the
thou
shalt
not
no
less
of
the
various
theologies
than
of
the
categorical
imperative
may
from
this
point
of
view
be
accounted
for
on
the
ground
of
the
of
man
so
far
as
he
is
with
the
transcendental
reality
behind
phaenomena
the
crude
threats
of
punishment
and
promises
of
reward
the
stern
moral
law
poised
in
mid
air
these
hypotheses
and
all
their
varieties
whose
function
is
in
reality
nothing
else
but
to
check
egoism
are
seen
to
be
due
to
the
imperfect
comprehension
of
or
rather
its
vague
groping
after
the
transcendental
unity
of
life
however
individualised
and
differentiated
as
a
phaenomenon
in
time
and
space
it
thus
becomes
apparent
that
the
position
developed
by
schopenhauer
in
the
third
and
fourth
parts
of
the
essay
is
not
so
much
destructive
as
explanatory
of
the
usual
theories
which
if
once
the
former
be
fully
grasped
lose
themselves
in
it
as
stars
and
moon
in
the
light
of
day
they
are
at
once
interpreted
and
shown
to
be
no
longer
of
importance
similarly
all
the
religions
of
the
world
which
are
the
metaphysics
of
the
people
find
their
in
the
same
doctrine
the
theory
of
an
takes
its
place
as
the
natural
mode
of
denoting
in
children
language
the
metaphysical
entity
whose
in
terms
of
our
consciousness
is
called
the
universe
the
circle
is
completed
the
discords
vanish
and
an
ultimate
harmony
is
reached
and
so
over
the
skein
of
phaenominal
existence
a
simplifying
and
integrating
light
is
shed
showing
that
the
is
but
the
reflection
of
the
under
the
forms
of
our
faculty
of
perception
namely
time
space
and
causality
forms
which
necessarily
imply
plurality
and
change
on
which
again
in
the
last
resort
the
depends
the
one
remains
the
many
change
and
pass
life
like
a
dome
of
glass
stains
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
until
death
tramples
it
to
fragments
what
an
unspeakable
gain
says
richard
wagner
we
should
bring
to
those
who
are
terrified
by
the
threats
of
the
church
and
on
the
other
hand
to
those
who
are
reduced
to
despair
by
our
physicists
if
we
could
quicken
the
noble
edifice
of
faith
and
hope
with
a
clear
consciousness
of
the
ideality
of
the
world
conditioned
by
the
laws
of
space
and
time
which
form
the
sole
basis
of
our
perceptive
capacity
in
that
case
all
anxious
inquiries
as
to
a

of
the
world
would
be
understood
to
be
only
answerable
by
a
blissful
smile
for
if
there
is
a
solution
to
these
questions
which
seem
of
such
boundless
importance
our
philosopher
has
given
it
with
incomparable
precision
and
beauty
in
the
following
sentence
which
to
a
certain
extent
is
only
a
corollary
to
the
definition
of

ideality

whole

undivided

the
widest
possible

touch

or

leading
conception
of
the
supreme
moral
law
occurs
by
a
necessity
which
seems
peculiar
to
the
subject
but
which
is
by
no
means
a
logical
one
both
in
that
science
whose
object
it
is
to
set
forth
the
knowledge
of
what
is
moral
and
also
in
real
life
where
it
shows
itself
partly
in
the
judgment
passed
by
conscience
on
our
own
actions
partly
in
our
moral
estimation
of
the
actions
of
others
moreover
most
of
the
chief
conceptions
in
ethics
springing
as
they
do
out
of
that
idea
and
inseparable
from
it
as
for
instance
the
conception
of
duty
and
the
ascription
of
praise
or
blame
assert
themselves
with
the
same
necessity
and
under
the
same
conditions
in
view
of
these
facts
and
because
it
appears
highly
desirable
considering
the
trend
of
philosophic
investigation
in
our
time
to
submit
this
matter
to
further
scrutiny
the
society
desires
that
the
following
question
be
carefully
considered
and
discussed
the
fountain
and
basis
of
morals
to
be
sought
in
an
idea
of
morality
which
lies
directly
in
the
consciousness
or
conscience
and
in
the
analysis
of
the
other
leading
ethical
conceptions
which
arise
from
it
or
is
it
to
be
found
an
some
other

the
problem
why
do
philosophers
differ
so
widely
as
to
the
first
principles
of
morals
but
agree
respecting
the
conclusions
and
duties
which
they
deduce
from
those
principles
this
is
the
question
which
was
set
as
subject
for
a
prize
essay
by
the
royal
society
of
holland
at
harlem
and
solved
by
meister
and
in
comparison
with
the
task
before
us
the
inquiry
presented
no
extraordinary
difficulty
for
the
present
question
of
the
royal
society
has
to
do
with
nothing
less
important
than
the
objectively
true
basis
of
morals
and
consequently
of
morality
it
is
an
academy
be
it
observed
which
invites
this
inquiry
and
hence
from
its
position
it
has
no
practical
purpose
in
view
it
asks
for
no
discourse
inculcating
the
exercise
of
uprightness
and
virtue
with
arguments
based
on
evidence
of
which
the
plausibility
is
dwelt
on
and
the
sophistry
evaded
as
is
done
in
popular
manuals
rather
as
its
aim
is
not
practical
but
only
theoretical
it
desires
nothing
but
the
purely
philosophical
that
is
the
objective
undisguised
and
naked
exposition
of
the
ultimate
basis
of
all
good
moral
conduct
independent
of
every
positive
law
of
every
improved
assumption
and
hence
free
from
all
groundwork
whether
metaphysical
or
mythical
this
however
is
a
problem
whose
bristling
difficulties
are
attested
by
the
circumstance
that
all
philosophers
in
every
age
and
land
have
blunted
their
wits
on
it
and
still
more
by
the
fact
that
all
gods
oriental
and
occidental
actually
derive
their
existence
therefrom
should
therefore
this
opportunity
serve
to
solve
it
assuredly
the
royal
society
will
not
have
expended
its
money
amiss
apart
from
this
a
peculiar
disadvantage
will
be
found
to
attach
to
any
theoretical
examination
of
the
basis
of
morals
because
such
an
investigation
is
suspiciously
like
an
attempt
to
undermine
and
occasion
the
collapse
of
the
structure
itself
the
fact
is
that
in
this
matter
we
are
apt
to
so
closely
associate
practical
aims
with
theory
that
the
zeal
of
the
former
is
with
difficulty
restrained
from
intervention
nor
is
it
within
the
power
of
every
one
to
clearly
dissociate
the
purely
theoretical
search
for
objective
truth
purged
of
all
interest
even
of
that
of
morality
as
practised
from
a
shameless
attack
on
the
heart
sacred
convictions
therefore
he
who
here
puts
his
hand
to
the
plough
must
for
his
encouragement
ever
bear
in
mind
that
from
the
doings
and
affairs
of
the
populace
from
the
turmoil
and
bustle
of
the
nothing
is
further
removed
than
the
quiet
retreat
and
sanctuary
of
the
academy
where
no
noise
of
the
world
may
enter
and
where
the
only
god
raised
on
a
pedestal
is
truth
in
solitary
naked
sublimity
the
conclusion
from
these
two
premises
is
that
i
must
be
allowed
complete
freedom
of
speech
as
well
as
the
right
of
questioning
everything
and
furthermore
that
if
i
succeed
in
really
contributing
something
however
small
to
this
subject
then
that
contribution
will
be
of
no
little
importance
but
there
are
still
other
difficulties
obstructing
my
path
the
royal
society
asks
for
a
short
monograph
setting
forth
the
basis
of
ethics
entirely
by
itself
which
means
to
say
independent
of
its
connection
with
the
general
system
the
actual
metaphysics
of
any
philosophy
such
a
demand
must
not
only
render
the
accomplishment
of
the
task
more
difficult
but
necessarily
make
it
imperfect
long
ago
christian
wolff
in
his
p
observed
in
philosophia
practica
non
dispelluntur
nisi
luce
metaphysica
darkness
in
practical
philosophy
is
only
dispersed
when
the
light
of
metaphysics
shines
on
it
and
kant
in
the
preface
to
his
zur
metaphysik
der
remarks
metaphysics
must
precede
and
is
in
every
case
indispensable
to
moral
philosophy
for
just
as
every
religion
on
earth
so
far
as
it
prescribes
morality
does
not
leave
the
latter
to
rest
on
itself
but
backs
it
by
a
body
of
dogmas
the
chief
end
of
which
is
precisely
to
be
the
prop
of
the
moral
sense
so
with
philosophy
the
ethical
basis
whatever
it
be
must
itself
attach
to
and
find
its
support
in
one
system
of
metaphysics
or
another
that
is
to
say
in
a
presupposed
explanation
of
the
world
and
of
existence
in
general
this
is
so
because
the
ultimate
and
true
conclusion
concerning
the
essential
nature
of
the
universe
must
necessarily
be
closely
connected
with
that
touching
the
ethical
significance
of
human
action
and
because
in
any
case
that
which
is
presented
as
the
foundation
of
morality
if
it
is
not
to
be
merely
an
abstract
formula
floating
in
the
clouds
and
out
of
contact
with
the
real
world
must
be
some
fact
or
other
discoverable
either
in
the
objective
kosmos
or
else
in
man
consciousness
but
as
such
it
can
itself
be
only
a
phaenomenon
and
consequently
like
all
other
phaenomena
it
requires
a
further
explanation
and
this
explanation
is
supplied
by
metaphysics
philosophy
indeed
is
such
a
connected
whole
that
it
is
impossible
to
exhaustively
discuss
any
one
part
without
all
the
others
being
involved
thus
plato
says
quite
correctly

do
you
think
then
it
is
possible
to
understand
at
all
adequately
the
nature
of
the
soul
without
at
the
same
time
understanding
the
nature
of
the
whole
the
totality
of
things
the
metaphysics
of
nature
the
metaphysics
of
morals
and
the
metaphysics
of
the
beautiful
mutually
presuppose
each
other
and
only
when
taken
as
connected
together
do
they
complete
the
explanation
of
things
as
they
really
are
and
of
existence
in
general
so
that
whoever
should
exactly
trace
one
of
these
three
to
its
ultimate
origin
would
be
found
to
have
necessarily
brought
the
others
into
his
solution
of
the
problem
just
as
an
absolutely
clear
and
exhaustive
understanding
of
any
single
thing
in
the
world
would
imply
a
perfect
comprehension
of
everything
else
now
if
we
were
to
start
from
a
given
system
of
metaphysics
which
is
assumed
to
be
true
we
should
reach
synthetically
a
basis
of
morals
and
this
basis
being
so
to
say
built
up
from
below
would
provide
the
resulting
ethical
structure
with
a
sure
foundation
but
in
the
present
case
since
the
terms
of
the
question
enforce
the
separation
of
ethics
from
all
metaphysics
there
remains
nothing
but
the
analytic
method
which
proceeds
from
facts
either
of
external
experience
or
of
consciousness
it
is
true
that
thus
the
ultimate
origin
of
the
latter
may
be
traced
back
to
the
human
spirit
a
source
which
then
however
must
be
taken
as
a
fundamental
fact
a
primary
phaenomenon
underivable
from
anything
else
with
the
result
that
the
whole
explanation
remains
simply
a
psychological
one
at
best
its
connection
with
any
general
metaphysical
standpoint
can
only
be
described
as
accessory
on
the
other
hand
the
fundamental
datum
the
primary
phaenomenon
of
ethics
so
found
in
man
nature
could
itself
in
its
turn
be
accounted
for
and
explained
if
we
might
first
treat
of
metaphysics
and
then
by
the
synthetic
method
deduce
ethics
from
it
this
would
mean
however
nothing
less
than
the
construction
of
a
complete
system
of
philosophy
whereby
the
limits
of
the
given
question
would
be
far
exceeded
i
am
therefore
compelled
to
answer
it
within
the
lines
which
its
own
isolated
narrowness
has
laid
down
and
lastly
there
is
the
following
consideration
the
basis
on
which
it
is
here
intended
to
place
ethics
will
prove
to
be
a
very
small
one
and
the
consequence
is
that
of
the
many
lawful
approvable
and
praiseworthy
actions
of
mankind
only
the
minority
will
be
found
to
spring
from
purely
moral
motives
while
the
majority
will
have
to
be
attributed
to
other
sources
this
gives
less
satisfaction
has
not
such
a
specious
glitter
as
let
us
say
a
categorical
imperative
which
always
stands
ready
for
commands
only
that
itself
in
its
turn
may
command
what
ought
to
be
done
and
what
ought
to
be
left
undone
not
to
mention
other
foundations
that
are
entirely
material
i
can
only
therefore
remind
the
reader
of
the
saying
in
ecclesiastes
iv
better
is
an
handful
with
quietness
than
both
the
hands
full
with
travail
and
vexation
of
spirit
in
all
knowledge
the
genuine
indestructible
coefficient
is
never
large
just
as
in
the
earth
metallic
strata
a
hundredweight
of
stone
hides
but
a
few
ounces
of
gold
but
whether
others
will
prefer
as
i
do
the
assured
to
the
bulky
possession
the
small
quantity
of
gold
which
remains
in
the
crucible
to
the
big
lump
of
matter
that
was
brought
along
with
it
or
whether
i
shall
rather
be
charged
with
having
removed
from
ethics
its
basis
instead
of
providing
one
in
so
far
as
i
prove
that
the
lawful
and
commendable
actions
of
mankind
often
do
not
contain
a
particle
of
pure
moral
worth
and
in
most
cases
only
a
very
little
resting
as
they
do
otherwise
on
motives
the
sufficiency
of
which
must
ultimately
be
referred
to
the
egoism
of
the
doer
all
this
i
must
leave
undecided
and
i
do
so
not
without
anxiety
nay
rather
with
resignation
because
i
have
long
since
been
of
the
same
mind
as
johann
georg
von
zimmermann
when
he
said
rest
assured
until
your
dying
day
that
nothing
in
the
world
is
so
rare
as
a
good
judge
die
pt
ch
p
for
all
true
and
voluntary
righteousness
for
all
for
all
nobleness
wherever
these
qualities
may
be
found
my
theory
can
only
point
to
a
very
small
foundation
whereas
my
opponents
confidently
construct
broad
bases
for
morals
which
are
made
strong
enough
for
every
possible
burden
and
are
at
the
same
time
thrust
upon
every
doubter
conscience
accompanied
with
a
threatening
at
his
own
morality
as
contrasted
with
these
my
own
position
is
indeed
in
sore
and
sorry
plight
it
is
like
that
of
cordelia
before
king
lear
with
her
weakly
worded
assurance
of
dutiful
affection
compared
with
the
effusive
protestations
of
her
more
eloquent
sisters
so
that
there
seems
to
be
need
of
a
cordial
that
may
be
furnished
by
some
maxim
taken
from
intellectual
hunting
grounds
such
as
est
vis
veritatis
et
great
is
the
strength
of
truth
and
it
will
prevail
but
to
a
man
who
has
lived
and
laboured
even
this
fails
to
give
much
encouragement
meanwhile
i
will
for
once
make
the
venture
with
truth
on
my
side
and
what
opposes
me
will
at
the
same
time
oppose
truth
that
is
the
categorical
imperative
appears
at
first
as
your
obedient
humble
servant
ready
to
perform
any
useful
service
the
solving
of
ethical
riddles
while
it
ends
by
gaining
the
upper
hand
and
chapter
ii
general
retrospect
for
the
people
morality
comes
through
and
is
founded
on
theology
as
the
express
will
of
god
on
the
other
hand
we
see
philosophers
with
few
exceptions
taking
special
pains
to
entirely
exclude
this
kind
of
foundation
indeed
so
they
may
but
avoid
it
they
prefer
even
to
find
a
refuge
in
sophistry
whence
comes
this
antithesis
assuredly
no
more
efficient
basis
for
ethics
can
be
imagined
than
the
theological
for
who
would
be
so
bold
as
to
oppose
the
will
of
the
almighty
and
the
omniscient
unquestionably
no
one
if
only
this
will
were
proclaimed
in
an
authentic
official
manner
if
one
may
say
so
whereby
no
possible
room
for
doubt
could
be
left
this
however
is
precisely
the
condition
which
does
not
admit
of
being
realised
it
is
rather
the
inverse
process
which
is
attempted
the
law
declared
to
be
the
will
of
god
men
try
to
accredit
as
such
by
demonstrating
its
agreement
with
our
own
independent
and
hence
natural
moral
views
and
an
appeal
is
consequently
made
to
these
as
being
more
direct
and
certain
but
this
is
not
all
we
perceive
that
an
action
performed
solely
through
threat
of
punishment
and
promise
of
reward
would
be
moral
much
more
in
appearance
than
in
reality
since
after
all
it
would
have
its
root
in
egoism
and
in
the
last
resort
the
scale
would
be
turned
by
the
greater
or
less
amount
of
credulity
evinced
in
each
case
now
it
was
none
other
than
kant
who
destroyed
the
foundations
of
speculative
theology
which
up
to
his
time
were
accounted
unshakable
speculative
theology
had
hitherto
sustained
ethics
and
in
order
to
procure
for
the
former
an
existence
of
some
sort
if
only
an
imaginary
one
his
wish
was
to
proceed
inversely
and
make
ethics
sustain
speculative
theology
so
that
it
is
now
more
than
ever
impossible
to
think
of
basing
ethics
on
theology
for
no
one
knows
any
longer
which
of
the
two
is
to
be
the
supporter
and
which
the
supported
and
the
consequence
is
a
it
is
precisely
through
the
influence
of
kant
philosophy
through
the
contemporaneous
effect
of
the
unparalleled
progress
made
in
all
the
natural
sciences
with
regard
to
which
every
past
age
in
comparison
with
our
own
appears
childish
and
lastly
through
the
knowledge
of
sanskrit
literature
and
of
those
most
ancient
and
widest
spread
faiths
brahmanism
and
buddhism
which
as
far
as
time
and
space
go
are
the
most
important
religions
systems
of
mankind
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
are
the
original
native
religions
of
our
own
race
now
well
known
to
be
of
asiatic
descent
our
race
to
which
in
its
new
strange
home
they
once
more
send
a
message
across
the
centuries
it
is
because
of
all
this
i
say
that
the
fundamental
philosophical
convictions
of
learned
europe
have
in
the
course
of
the
last
fifty
years
undergone
a
revolution
which
perhaps
many
only
reluctantly
admit
but
which
can
not
be
denied
the
result
of
this
change
is
that
the
old
supports
of
ethics
have
been
shown
to
be
rotten
while
the
assurance
remains
that
ethics
itself
can
never
collapse
whence
the
conviction
arises
that
for
it
there
must
exist
a
groundwork
different
from
any
hitherto
provided
and
adaptable
to
the
advanced
views
of
the
age
the
need
of
such
is
making
itself
felt
more
and
more
and
in
it
we
undoubtedly
find
the
reason
that
has
induced
the
royal
society
to
make
the
present
important
question
the
subject
of
a
prize
essay
in
every
age
much
good
morality
has
been
preached
but
the
explanation
of
its
has
always
been
encompassed
with
difficulties
on
the
whole
we
discern
an
endeavour
to
get
at
some
objective
truth
from
which
the
ethical
injunctions
logically
deduced
and
it
has
been
sought
for
both
in
the
nature
of
things
and
in
the
nature
of
man
but
in
vain
the
result
was
always
the
same
the
will
of
each
human
unit
was
found
to
gravitate
solely
towards
its
own
individual
welfare
the
idea
of
which
in
its
entirety
is
designated
by
the
term
blissfulness
and
this
striving
after
leads
mankind
by
a
path
very
different
to
the
one
morality
would
fain
point
out
the
endeavour
was
next
made
now
to
identify
blissfulness
with
virtue
now
to
represent
it
as
virtue
consequence
and
effect
both
attempts
have
always
failed
and
this
for
no
want
of
sophistry
then
recourse
was
had
to
artificial
formulas
purely
objective
and
abstract
as
well
as
from
which
correct
ethical
conduct
undoubtedly
admitted
of
being
deduced
but
there
was
nothing
found
in
man
nature
to
afford
these
a
footing
whereby
they
might
have
availed
to
guide
the
strivings
of
his
volition
in
face
of
its
egoistic
tendency
it
appears
to
me
superfluous
to
verify
all
this
by
describing
and
criticising
every
hitherto
existing
foundation
of
morality
not
only
because
i
share
augustine
opinion
est
pro
magno
habendum
quid
homines
senserint
sed
quae
sit
rei
it
is
the
truth
about
a
thing
not
men
opinions
thereon
that
is
of
importance
but
also
because
it
would
be
like
εἰς
carrying
coals
to
newcastle
for
previous
attempts
to
give
a
foundation
to
ethics
are
sufficiently
to
the
royal
society
and
the
very
question
proposed
shows
that
it
is
also
convinced
of
their
inadequateness
any
reader
less
will
find
a
careful
if
not
complete
presentment
of
the
attempts
hitherto
made
in
garve
der
vornehmsten
principien
der
and
again
in
der
it
is
of
course
very
disheartening
to
reflect
that
ethics
which
so
directly
concerns
life
has
met
with
the
same
unhappy
fate
as
the
abstruse
science
of
metaphysics
and
that
its
first
principle
though
perpetually
sought
for
ever
since
the
time
of
socrates
has
still
to
be
found
moreover
we
must
remember
that
in
ethics
much
more
than
in
any
other
science
what
is
essential
is
contained
in
its
fundamental
propositions
the
deductions
are
so
simple
that
they
come
of
themselves
for
all
are
capable
of
drawing
a
conclusion
but
few
of
judging
and
this
is
exactly
the
reason
why
lengthy
and
dissertations
on
morals
are
as
superfluous
as
they
are
tedious
meantime
if
i
may
postulate
an
acquaintance
with
all
the
former
foundations
of
ethics
my
task
will
be
lightened
whoever
observes
how
ancient
as
well
as
modern
philosophers
the
church
creed
sufficed
for
the
middle
ages
have
had
recourse
to
the
most
diverse
and
extraordinary
arguments
in
order
to
provide
for
the
generally
recognised
requirements
of
morality
a
basis
capable
of
proof
and
how
notwithstanding
they
admittedly
failed
he
will
be
able
to
measure
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
and
estimate
my
contribution
accordingly
and
he
who
has
learned
to
know
that
none
of
the
roads
hitherto
struck
on
lead
to
the
goal
will
be
the
more
willing
to
tread
with
me
a
very
different
path
from
these
a
path
which
up
to
now
either
has
not
been
noticed
or
else
has
been
passed
over
with
contempt
perhaps
because
it
was
the
most
natural
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
solution
of
the
question
will
remind
many
of
columbus
egg
it
is
solely
to
the
latest
attempt
at
giving
a
basis
to
ethics
i
mean
the
kantian
that
a
critical
examination
will
be
devoted
i
shall
make
it
all
the
more
exhaustive
partly
because
the
great
ethical
reform
of
kant
gave
to
this
science
a
foundation
having
a
real
superiority
to
previous
ones
and
partly
because
it
still
remains
the
last
important
pronouncement
in
this
domain
for
which
reason
it
has
obtained
general
acceptance
up
to
the
present
day
and
is
universally
taught
although
differently
garnished
by
certain
changes
in
the
demonstration
and
in
the
terminology
it
is
the
ethical
system
of
the
last
sixty
years
which
must
be
removed
ere
we
enter
on
another
path
furthermore
my
criticism
of
the
kantian
basis
will
give
me
occasion
to
examine
and
discuss
most
of
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
ethics
and
the
outcome
of
this
investigation
i
shall
later
on
be
able
to
postulate
besides
inasmuch
as
opposites
illustrate
each
other
it
is
exactly
this
course
which
will
be
the
best
preparation
and
guide
indeed
the
direct
way
to
my
own
position
which
in
its
essential
points
is
diametrically
opposed
to
kant
it
would
therefore
be
a
very
perverse
beginning
to
skip
the
following
criticism
and
turn
at
once
to
the
positive
part
of
my
exposition
which
then
would
remain
only
half
intelligible
in
any
case
the
time
has
assuredly
arrived
for
once
to
cite
ethics
before
the
bar
of
a
searching
scrutiny
during
more
than
half
a
century
it
has
been
lying
comfortably
on
the
restful
cushion
which
kant
arranged
for
it
the
cushion
of
the
categorical
imperative
of
practical
reason
in
our
day
this
imperative
is
mostly
introduced
to
us
under
a
name
which
being
smoother
and
less
ostentatious
has
obtained
more
currency
it
is
called
the
moral
law
and
thus
entitled
with
a
passing
bow
to
reason
and
experience
it
slips
through
unobserved
into
the
house
once
inside
there
is
no
end
to
its
orders
and
commands
nor
can
it
ever
afterwards
be
brought
to
account
it
was
proper
indeed
inevitable
that
kant
as
the
inventor
of
the
thing
should
remain
satisfied
with
his
creation
particularly
as
he
shelved
by
its
means
errors
still
more
glaring
but
to
be
obliged
to
look
on
and
see
asses
disporting
themselves
on
the
comfortable
cushion
which
he
prepared
and
which
since
his
time
has
been
more
and
more
trampled
on
and
flattened
out
this
truly
is
hard
i
allude
to
the
daily
hackney
compilers
who
with
the
ready
confidence
born
of
stupidity
imagine
that
they
have
given
a
foundation
to
ethics
if
they
do
but
appeal
to
that
moral
law
which
is
alleged
to
be
inherent
in
our
reason
and
then
they
complacently
weave
upon
this
such
a
confused
and
tissue
of
phrases
that
they
succeed
in
rendering
unintelligible
the
clearest
and
simplest
relations
of
life
and
all
this
without
ever
once
seriously
asking
themselves
whether
in
point
of
fact
there
really
does
exist
such
a
moral
law
as
a
convenient
code
of
morality
graven
in
our
heads
or
hearts
hence
i
admit
the
especial
pleasure
i
feel
in
proceeding
to
remove
from
ethics
its
broad
cushion
of
repose
and
i
unreservedly
declare
my
intention
of
proving
that
kant
practical
reason
and
categorical
imperative
are
completely
unwarrantable
baseless
and
fabricated
assumptions
and
i
shall
further
show
that
whole
system
like
those
of
his
predecessors
is
in
want
of
a
solid
foundation
consequently
ethics
will
again
be
consigned
to
its
former
entirely
helpless
condition
there
to
remain
until
i
come
to
demonstrate
the
true
moral
principle
of
human
nature
a
principle
which
is
incontestably
efficient
and
has
its
root
in
our
very
being
the
latter
however
has
no
such
broad
basis
to
offer
as
the
cushion
so
that
doubtless
those
who
are
accustomed
to
take
things
easily
will
not
abandon
their
comfortable
old
seat
before
they
are
thoroughly
aware
how
deeply
the
ground
on
which
it
stands
is
undermined

preliminary
remarks
it
is
kant
great
service
to
moral
science
that
he
purified
it
of
all
eudaemonism
with
the
ancients
ethics
was
a
doctrine
of
eudaemonism
with
the
moderns
for
the
most
part
it
has
been
a
doctrine
of
salvation
the
former
wished
to
prove
that
virtue
and
happiness
are
identical
but
this
was
like
having
two
figures
which
never
coincide
with
each
other
no
matter
how
they
may
be
placed
the
latter
have
endeavoured
to
connect
the
two
not
by
the
principle
of
identity
but
by
that
of
causation
thus
making
happiness
the
result
of
virtue
but
to
do
this
they
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
sophisms
or
else
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
world
beyond
any
possible
perception
of
the
senses
among
the
ancients
plato
alone
forms
an
exception
his
system
is
not
eudaemonistic
it
is
mystic
instead
even
the
ethics
of
the
cynics
and
stoics
is
nothing
but
a
special
form
of
eudaemonism
to
prove
which
there
is
no
lack
of
evidence
and
testimony
but
the
nature
of
my
present
task
forbids
the
space
the
ancients
then
equally
with
the
moderns
plato
being
the
single
exception
agree
in
making
virtue
only
a
means
to
an
end
indeed
strictly
speaking
even
kant
banished
eudaemonism
from
ethics
more
in
appearance
than
in
reality
for
between
virtue
and
happiness
he
still
leaves
a
certain
mysterious
connection
there
is
an
obscure
and
difficult
passage
in
his
doctrine
of
the
highest
good
where
they
occur
together
while
it
is
a
patent
fact
that
the
course
of
virtue
runs
entirely
counter
to
that
of
happiness
but
passing
over
this
we
may
say
that
with
kant
the
ethical
principle
appears
as
something
quite
independent
of
experience
and
its
teaching
it
is
transcendental
or
metaphysical
he
recognises
that
human
conduct
possesses
a
significance
that
oversteps
all
possibility
of
experience
and
is
therefore
actually
the
bridge
leading
to
that
which
he
calls
the
intelligible
world
the
the
world
of
things
in
themselves
the
fame
which
the
kantian
ethics
has
won
is
due
not
only
to
this
higher
level
which
it
reached
but
also
to
the
moral
purity
and
loftiness
of
its
conclusions
it
is
by
the
latter
that
most
people
have
been
attracted
without
paying
much
attention
to
the
foundation
which
is
propounded
in
a
very
complex
abstract
and
artificial
form
and
kant
himself
required
all
his
powers
of
acumen
and
synthesis
to
give
it
an
appearance
of
solidity
fortunately
he
separated
his
ethics
from
the
exposition
of
its
basis
devoting
to
the
latter
a
special
work
entitled
the
zur
metaphysik
der
the
theme
of
which
will
be
found
to
be
precisely
the
same
as
that
of
our
prize
essay
for
on
page
xiii
of
the
preface
he
says
the
present
treatise
is
nothing
else
but
an
attempt
to
find
out
and
establish
the
supreme
principle
of
morality
this
is
an
investigation
whose
scope
is
complete
in
itself
and
which
should
be
kept
apart
from
all
other
moral
it
is
in
this
book
that
we
find
the
basis
that
is
to
say
the
essentials
of
his
ethics
set
forth
with
an
acute
penetration
and
systematic
conciseness
as
in
no
other
of
his
writings
it
has
moreover
the
great
advantage
of
being
the
first
of
kant
moral
works
appearing
as
it
did
only
four
years
later
than
the
der
reinen
and
consequently
it
dates
from
the
period
when
although
he
was
the
detrimental
effect
of
old
age
on
his
intellect
was
not
yet
perceptible
on
the
other
hand
this
is
distinctly
traceable
in
the
der
praktischen
which
was
published
in
or
one
year
later
than
the
unhappy
remodelling
of
the
der
reinen
in
the
second
edition
whereby
the
latter
his
immortal
was
obviously
marred
an
analysis
of
this
question
is
to
be
found
in
the
preface
to
the
new
edition
by
rosenkranz
from
which
my
own
investigation
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
dissent
the
der
praktischen
contains
in
its
essentials
the
same
material
as
the
only
the
latter
has
a
more
concise
and
rigorous
form
while
in
the
former
the
subject
is
handled
with
greater
prolixity
interspersed
with
digressions
and
even
padded
with
some
pieces
of
moral
rhetoric
to
heighten
the
impression
when
kant
wrote
it
he
had
at
last
and
late
in
life
become
deservedly
famous
hence
being
certain
of
boundless
attention
he
allowed
greater
play
to
the
garrulity
of
old
age
but
the
der
praktischen
contains
two
sections
which
are
peculiar
to
itself
first
the
exposition
of
the
relation
between
freedom
and
necessity
pp
of
the
fourth
edition
and
pp
in
rosenkranz
this
passage
is
above
all
praise
and
undoubtedly
was
framed
earlier
in
his
life
as
it
is
entirely
in
harmony
with
his
treatment
of
the
same
subject
in
the
der
reinen
pp
rosenkranz
and
secondly
the
which
will
more
and
more
come
to
be
recognised
as
the
real
object
kant
had
in
view
in
his
anfangsgründe
der
this
to
the
deplorable
written
in
the
debility
of
old
age
is
at
length
fully
for
all
these
reasons
the
present
criticism
will
mainly
deal
with
the
treatise
first
mentioned
the
zur
metaphysik
der
and
the
reader
will
please
understand
that
all
the
page
numbers
given
by
themselves
refer
to
it
both
the
other
works
will
only
be
considered
as
accessory
and
secondary
for
a
proper
comprehension
of
the
present
criticism
which
in
probing
the
kantian
ethics
to
its
depths
bears
directly
and
principally
on
this
it
is
very
desirable
that
the
latter
be
carefully
read
through
again
so
that
the
mind
may
have
a
perfectly
clear
and
fresh
presentment
of
what
it
contains
it
is
but
a
matter

derived
from
myself
but
in
this
place
i
am
speaking
incognito
chapter
ii
on
the
imperative
form
of
the
kantian
ethics
kant
first
false
step
lies
in
his
conception
of
ethics
itself
and
this
is
found
very
clearly
expressed
on
page
in
a
system
of
practical
philosophy
we
are
not
concerned
with
adducing
reasons
for
that
which
takes
place
but
with
formulating
laws
regarding
that
which
to
take
place
even
if
it
never
does
take
this
is
at
once
a
distinct
who
tells
you
that
there
are
laws
to
which
our
conduct
to
be
subject
who
tells
you
that
that
to
take
place
which
in
fact
never
does
take
what
justification
have
you
for
making
this
assumption
at
the
outset
and
consequently
for
forcing
upon
us
as
the
only
possible
one
a
system
of
ethics
couched
in
the
imperative
terms
of
legislation
i
say
in
contradistinction
to
kant
that
the
student
of
ethics
and
no
less
the
philosopher
in
general
must
content
himself
with
explaining
and
interpreting
that
which
is
given
in
other
words
that
which
really
is
or
takes
place
so
as
to
obtain
an
of
it
and
i
maintain
furthermore
that
there
is
plenty
to
do
in
this
direction
much
more
than
has
hitherto
been
done
after
the
lapse
of
thousands
of
years
following
the
above
kant
straightway
without
any
previous
investigation
assumes
in
the
preface
which
is
entirely
devoted
to
the
subject
that
purely
moral
laws
exist
and
this
assumption
remains
thenceforth
undisturbed
and
forms
the
very
foundation
of
his
whole
system
we
however
prefer
first
of
all
to
examine
the
conception
denoted
by
the
word
law
the
true
and
original
meaning
of
the
term
is
limited
to
law
as
between
citizens
it
is
the
of
the
romans
and
greeks
a
human
institution
and
depending
on
human
volition
it
has
a
secondary
derived
figurative
metaphorical
meaning
when
applied
to
nature
whose
operations
partly
known
partly
learnt
by
experience
and
which
are
always
constant
we
call
natural
laws
only
a
very
small
portion
of
these
natural
laws
can
be
discerned
and
with
admirable
acuteness
kant
set
them
apart
and
classed
them
under
the
name
metaphysics
of
nature
there
is
also
undoubtedly
a
law
for
the
human
will
in
so
far
as
man
belongs
to
nature
and
this
law
is
strictly
provable
admits
of
no
exception
is
inviolable
and
immovable
as
the
mountains
and
does
not
like
the
categorical
imperative
imply
a
but
rather
a
complete
and
absolute
one
it
is
the
law
of
motivation
a
form
of
the
law
of
causation
in
other
words
it
is
the
causation
which
is
brought
about
by
the
medium
of
the
understanding
it
is
the
sole
demonstrable
law
to
which
the
human
will
is
subject
it
means
that
every
action
can
only
take
place
in
consequence
of
a
sufficient
motive
like
causality
in
general
it
is
a
natural
law
on
the
other
hand
moral
laws
apart
from
human
institution
state
ordinance
or
religious
doctrine
can
not
rightly
be
assumed
as
existing
without
proof
kant
therefore
by
taking
such
laws
for
granted
is
guilty
of
a
which
is
all
the
bolder
in
that
he
at
once
adds
page
vi
of
the
preface
that
a
moral
law
ought
to
imply
but
absolute
necessity
is
everywhere
characterised
by
an
inevitable
chain
of
consequence
how
then
can
such
a
conception
be
attached
to
these
alleged
moral
laws
as
an
instance
of
which
he
adduces
thou
shalt
not
lie
every
one
knows
and
he
himself
admits
that
no
such
consecution
for
the
most
part
takes
place
the
reverse
indeed
is
the
rule
in
scientific
ethics
before
we
admit
as
controlling
the
will
other
laws
besides
that
of
which
are
original
and
independent
of
all
human
ordinance
we
must
first
prove
and
deduce
their
existence
that
is
provided
in
things
ethical
we
are
concerned
not
merely
with
recommending
honesty
but
with
practising
it
until
that
proof
be
furnished
i
shall
recognise
only
one
source
to
which
is
traceable
the
importation
into
ethics
of
the
conception
precept
it
is
one
which
is
foreign
to
philosophy
i
mean
the
mosaic
decalogue
indeed
the
spelling
in
the
above
instance
of
a
moral
law
the
first
put
forward
by
kant
naïvely
betrays
this
origin
a
conception
however
which
point
to
no
other
source
than
this
has
no
right
without
undergoing
further
scrutiny
thus
to
force
its
way
into
philosophical
ethics
it
will
be
rejected
until
introduced
by
duly
accredited
proof
thus
on
the
threshold
of
the
subject
kant
makes
his
first
and
that
no
small
one
our
philosopher
then
by
begging
the
question
in
his
preface
simply
assumes
the
conception
of
as
given
and
existing
beyond
all
doubt
and
he
treats
the
closely
related
conception
of
duty
page
exactly
in
the
same
way
without
subjecting
it
to
any
further
test
he
admits
it
forthwith
as
a
proper
appurtenance
of
ethics
but
here
again
i
am
compelled
to
enter
a
protest
this
conception
equally
with
the
kindred
notions
of
command
taken
thus
unconditionally
has
its
source
in
theological
morals
and
it
will
remain
a
stranger
to
philosophical
morals
so
long
as
it
fails
to
furnish
sufficient
credentials
drawn
either
from
man
nature
or
from
the
objective
world
till
then
i
can
only
recognise
the
decalogue
as
the
origin
of
all
these
connected
conceptions
since
the
rise
of
christianity
there
is
no
doubt
that
philosophical
has
been
unconsciously
moulded
by
theological
ethics
and
since
the
latter
is
essentially
dictatorial
the
former
appears
in
the
shape
of
precepts
and
inculcation
of
duty
in
all
innocence
and
without
any
suspicion
that
first
an
ulterior
sanction
is
needful
for
this
rather
does
she
suppose
it
to
be
her
proper
and
natural
form
it
is
true
that
all
peoples
ages
and
creeds
and
indeed
all
philosophers
with
the
exception
of
the
materialists
proper
have
undeniably
recognised
that
the
ethical
significance
of
human
conduct
is
a
metaphysical
one
in
other
words
that
it
stretches
out
beyond
this
phaenomenal
existence
and
reaches
to
eternity
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
presentment
of
this
fact
in
terms
of
command
and
obedience
of
law
and
duty
is
no
part
of
its
essence
furthermore
separated
from
the
theological
hypotheses
whence
they
have
sprung
these
conceptions
lose
in
reality
all
meaning
and
to
attempt
a
substitute
for
the
former
by
talking
with
kant
of
obligation
and
of
duty
is
to
feed
the
reader
with
empty
words
nay
more
is
to
give
him
a
in
to
digest
every
obligation
derives
all
sense
and
meaning
simply
and
solely
from
its
relation
to
threatened
punishment
or
promised
reward
hence
long
before
kant
was
thought
of
locke
says
for
since
it
would
be
utterly
in
vain
to
suppose
a
rule
set
to
the
free
actions
of
man
without
annexing
to
it
some
enforcement
of
good
and
evil
to
determine
his
will
we
must
wherever
we
suppose
a
law
suppose
also
some
reward
or
punishment
annexed
to
that
law
on
the
human
bk
ch
what
to
be
done
is
therefore
necessarily
conditioned
by
punishment
or
reward
consequently
to
use
kant
language
it
is
essentially
and
inevitably
and
never
as
he
maintains
if
we
think
away
these
conditions
the
conception
of
obligation
becomes
void
of
sense
hence
absolute
obligation
is
most
certainly
a
in
a
commanding
voice
whether
it
come
from
within
or
from
without
can
not
possibly
be
imagined
except
as
threatening
or
promising
consequently
obedience
to
it
which
may
be
wise
or
foolish
according
to
circumstances
is
yet
always
actuated
by
selfishness
and
therefore
morally
worthless
the
complete
unthinkableness
and
nonsense
of
this
conception
of
an
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
kantian
ethics
appears
later
in
the
system
itself
namely
in
the
der
praktischen
just
as
some
concealed
poison
in
an
organism
can
not
remain
hid
but
sooner
or
later
must
come
out
and
show
itself
for
this
said
to
be
so
nevertheless
postulates
more
than
one
condition
in
the
background
it
assumes
a
rewarder
a
reward
and
the
immortality
of
the
person
to
be
rewarded
this
is
of
course
unavoidable
if
one
really
makes
duty
and
obligation
the
fundamental
conception
of
ethics
for
these
ideas
are
essentially
relative
and
depend
for
their
significance
on
the
threatened
penalty
or
the
promised
reward
the
guerdon
which
is
assumed
to
be
in
store
for
virtue
shows
clearly
enough
that
only
in
appearance
she
works
for
nothing
it
is
however
put
forward
modestly
veiled
under
the
name
of
the
which
is
the
union
of
virtue
and
happiness
but
this
is
at
bottom
nothing
else
but
a
morality
that
derives
its
origin
from
happiness
which
means
a
morality
resting
on
selfishness
in
other
words
it
is
eudaemonism
which
kant
had
solemnly
thrust
out
of
the
front
door
of
his
system
as
an
intruder
only
to
let
it
creep
in
again
by
the
postern
under
the
name
of
the
this
is
how
the
assumption
of
absolute
concealing
as
it
does
a
contradiction
avenges
itself
obligation
on
the
other
hand
can
not
of
course
be
any
first
principle
for
ethics
since
everything
done
out
of
regard
for
reward
or
punishment
is
necessarily
an
egoistic
transaction
and
as
such
is
without
any
real
moral
value
all
this
makes
it
clear
that
a
nobler
and
wider
view
of
ethics
is
needed
if
we
are
in
earnest
about
our
endeavour
to
truly
account
for
the
significance
of
human
conduct
a
significance
which
extends
beyond
phaenomena
and
is
eternal
as
all
obligation
is
entirely
dependent
on
a
condition
so
also
is
all
duty
both
conceptions
are
very
closely
related
indeed
almost
identical
the
only
difference
between
them
might
be
said
to
be
that
obligation
in
general
may
rest
on
mere
force
whereas
duty
involves
the
sense
of
obligation
deliberately
undertaken
such
as
we
see
between
master
and
servant
principal
and
subordinate
rulers
and
the
ruled
and
since
no
one
undertakes
a
duty
every
duty
implies
also
a
right
the
slave
has
no
duties
because
he
has
no
rights
but
he
is
subject
to
an
obligation
which
rests
on
sheer
force
in
the
following
part
i
shall
explain
the
only
meaning
which
the
conception
has
in
ethics
if
we
put
ethics
in
an
form
making
it
a
doctrine
of
duties
and
regard
the
moral
worth
or
worthlessness
of
human
conduct
as
the
fulfilment
or
violation
of
duties
we
must
remember
that
this
view
of
duty
and
of
obligation
in
general
is
undeniably
derived
solely
from
theological
morals
and
primarily
from
the
decalogue
and
consequently
that
it
rests
essentially
and
inseparably
on
the
assumption
of
man
dependence
on
another
will
which
gives
him
commands
and
announces
reward
or
punishment
but
the
more
the
assumption
of
such
a
will
is
in
theology
positive
and
precise
the
less
should
it
be
quietly
and
unsuspectingly
introduced
into
philosophical
morals
hence
we
have
no
right
to
assume
beforehand
that
for
the
latter
the
the
ordaining
of
commands
laws
and
duties
is
an
essential
and
a
matter
of
course
and
it
is
a
very
poor
shift
to
substitute
the
word
absolute
or
categorical
for
the
external
condition
which
is
indissolubly
attached
to
such
conceptions
by
their
very
nature
for
this
gives
rise
as
explained
above
to
a
in
kant
then
without
more
ado
or
any
close
examination
borrowed
this
of
ethics
from
theological
morals
the
hypotheses
of
the
latter
in
other
words
theology
really
lie
at
the
root
of
his
system
and
as
these
alone
in
point
of
fact
lend
it
any
meaning
or
sense
so
they
can
not
be
separated
from
indeed
are
implicitly
contained
in
it
after
this
when
he
had
expounded
his
position
the
task
of
developing
in
turn
a
theology
out
of
his
morals
the
famous
was
easy
enough
for
the
conceptions
which
are
implicitly
involved
in
his
imperative
and
which
lie
hidden
at
the
base
of
his
morals
only
required
to
be
brought
forward
and
expressed
explicitly
as
postulates
of
practical
reason
and
so
it
was
that
to
the
world
great
edification
a
theology
appeared
depending
simply
on
ethics
indeed
actually
derived
therefrom
but
this
came
about
because
the
ethical
system
itself
rests
on
concealed
theological
hypotheses
i
mean
no
derisive
comparison
but
in
its
form
the
process
is
analogous
to
that
whereby
a
conjurer
prepares
a
surprise
for
us
when
he
lets
us
find
something
where
he
had
previously
employed
his
art
to
place
it
described
in
the
abstract
kant
procedure
is
this
what
ought
to
have
been
his
first
principle
or
hypothesis
theology
he
made
the
conclusion
and
what
ought
to
have
been
deduced
as
the
conclusion
the
categorical
command
he
took
as
his
hypothesis
but
after
he
had
thus
turned
the
thing
upside
down
nobody
not
even
he
himself
recognised
it
as
being
what
it
really
was
namely
the
old
system
of
theological
morals
how
this
trick
was
accomplished
we
shall
consider
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
chapters
of
the
present
part
ethics
was
of
course
frequently
put
in
the
imperative
form
and
treated
as
a
doctrine
of
duties
also
in
philosophy
but
it
was
always
then
based
upon
the
will
of
a
god
whose
existence
had
been
otherwise
proved
and
so
there
was
no
inconsequence
as
soon
however
as
the
attempt
was
made
as
kant
attempted
to
give
a
foundation
to
ethics
independent
of
this
will
and
establish
it
without
metaphysical
hypotheses
there
was
no
longer
any
justification
for
taking
as
its
basis
the
words
thou
shalt
and
it
is
thy
duty
that
is
the
imperative
form
without
first
deducing
the
truth
thereof
from
some
other
source
du
sollt
nicht
lügen
sollt
is
the
old
form
for
cf
icel
a
contradiction
in
the
adjective
this
occurs
when
the
epithet
applied
to
a
noun
contradicts
its
essential
like
the
converse
of
a
geometrical
proposition
this
kantian
inversion
is
not
necessarily
true
its
validity
in
fact
depends
on
the
conclusion
being
implicitly
contained
in
the
hypothesis
chapter
iii
on
the
assumption
of
duties
towards
ourselves
in
particular
this
form
of
the
doctrine
of
duties
was
very
acceptable
to
kant
and
in
working
out
his
position
he
left
it
untouched
for
like
his
predecessors
along
with
the
duties
towards
others
he
ranged
also
duties
towards
ourselves
i
however
entirely
reject
this
assumption
and
as
there
will
be
no
better
opportunity
i
shall
here
incidentally
explain
my
view
duties
towards
ourselves
must
just
as
all
others
be
based
either
on
right
or
on
love
duties
towards
ourselves
based
on
right
are
impossible
because
of
the
fundamental
principle
non
fit
where
the
will
assents
no
injury
is
done
for
what
i
do
is
always
what
i
will
consequently
also
what
i
do
to
myself
is
never
anything
but
what
i
will
therefore
it
can
not
be
unjust
next
as
regards
duties
towards
ourselves
based
on
love
ethics
here
finds
her
work
already
done
and
comes
too
late
the
impossibility
of
violating
the
duty
of
is
at
once
assumed
by
the
first
law
of
christian
morals
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
according
to
this
the
love
which
each
man
cherishes
for
himself
is
postulated
as
the
and
as
the
condition
of
all
other
love
while
the
converse
love
thyself
as
thy
neighbour
is
never
added
for
every
one
would
feel
that
the
latter
does
not
claim
enough
moreover
would
be
the
sole
duty
regularly
involving
an
kant
himself
says
in
the
anfangsgründe
zur
that
which
each
man
inevitably
wills
of
himself
does
not
belong
to
the
conception
of
duty
this
idea
of
duties
towards
ourselves
is
nevertheless
still
held
in
repute
indeed
it
enjoys
for
the
most
part
special
favour
nor
need
we
feel
surprise
but
it
has
an
amusing
effect
in
cases
where
people
begin
to
show
anxiety
about
their
persons
and
talk
quite
earnestly
of
the
duty
of
the
while
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
fear
will
lend
them
legs
soon
enough
and
that
they
have
no
need
of
any
law
of
duty
to
help
them
along
first
among
the
duties
towards
ourselves
is
generally
placed
that
of
not
committing
suicide
the
line
of
argument
taken
being
extremely
prejudiced
and
resting
on
the
shallowest
basis
unlike
animals
man
is
not
only
a
prey
to
pain
limited
to
the
passing
moment
but
also
to
those
incomparably
greater
sufferings
which
reaching
forwards
and
backwards
draw
upon
the
future
and
the
past
and
nature
by
way
of
compensation
has
granted
to
man
alone
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
end
his
life
at
his
own
pleasure
before
she
herself
sets
a
term
to
it
thus
while
animals
necessarily
live
so
long
as
they
can
man
need
only
live
so
long
as
he
whether
he
ought
on
ethical
grounds
to
forego
this
privilege
is
a
difficult
question
which
in
any
case
can
not
be
decided
by
the
usual
superficial
reasoning
the
arguments
against
suicide
which
kant
does
not
deem
unworthy
of
adducing
and
i
can
not
conscientiously
describe
as
other
than
pitiable
and
quite
undeserving
of
an
answer
it
is
laughable
indeed
to
suppose
that
reflections
of
such
a
kind
could
have
wrested
the
dagger
from
the
hands
of
cato
of
cleopatra
of
cocceius
nerva
tac
vi
or
of
arria
the
wife
of
paetus
iii
if
real
moral
motives
for
not
committing
suicide
actually
exist
it
is
certain
that
they
lie
very
deep
and
can
not
be
reached
by
the
plummet
of
ordinary
ethics
they
belong
to
a
higher
view
of
things
than
is
adaptable
even
to
the
standpoint
of
the
present
treatise
that
which
generally
comes
next
on
the
rubric
of
duties
towards
ourselves
may
be
divided
partly
into
rules
of
worldly
wisdom
partly
into
hygienic
prescriptions
but
neither
class
belongs
to
morals
in
the
proper
sense
last
on
the
catalogue
comes
the
prohibition
of
unnatural
lust
onanism
and
bestiality
of
these
onanism
is
mainly
a
vice
of
childhood
and
must
be
fought
against
much
more
with
the
weapon
of
dietetics
than
with
that
of
ethics
hence
we
find
that
the
authors
of
books
directed
against
it
are
physicians
tissot
and
others
rather
than
moralists
after
dietetics
and
hygiene
have
done
their
work
and
struck
it
down
by
irrefutable
reasoning
if
ethics
desires
to
take
up
the
matter
she
finds
little
left
for
her
to
do
bestiality
again
is
of
very
rare
occurrence
it
is
thoroughly
abnormal
and
exceptional
and
moreover
so
loathsome
and
foreign
to
human
nature
that
itself
better
than
all
arguments
of
reason
passes
judgment
on
itself
and
deters
by
sheer
disgust
for
the
rest
as
being
a
degradation
of
human
nature
it
is
in
reality
an
offence
against
the
species
as
such
and
in
the
abstract
not
against
human
units
of
the
three
sexual
perversions
of
which
we
are
speaking
it
is
consequently
only
with
that
ethics
has
to
do
and
in
treating
of
justice
this
vice
finds
its
proper
place
for
justice
is
infringed
by
it
in
face
of
which
fact
the
dictum
non
fit
is
unavailing
the
injustice
consists
in
the
seduction
of
the
younger
and
inexperienced
person
who
is
thereby
ruined
physically
and
morally
there
are
ascetic
reasons
which
may
be
found
in
the
fourth
book
vol
of
my
chief
work
welt

chapter
iv
on
the
basis
of
the
kantian
ethics
with
the
imperative
form
of
ethics
which
in
chapter
ii
we
proved
to
be
a
is
directly
connected
a
favourite
idea
of
kant
that
may
be
excused
but
can
not
be
adopted
sometimes
we
see
a
physician
after
having
employed
a
certain
remedy
with
conspicuous
success
henceforth
prescribing
it
for
almost
all
diseases
to
such
a
one
kant
may
be
likened
by
separating
the
from
the
in
human
knowledge
he
made
the
most
brilliant
and
pregnant
discovery
that
metaphysics
can
boast
of
what
wonder
then
that
thereafter
he
should
try
to
apply
this
method
this
sundering
of
the
two
forms
everywhere
and
should
consequently
make
ethics
also
consist
of
two
parts
a
pure
an
knowable
part
and
an
empirical
the
latter
of
these
he
rejects
as
unreliable
for
the
purpose
of
founding
ethics
to
trace
out
the
former
and
exhibit
it
by
itself
is
his
purpose
in
the
der
metaphysik
der
which
he
accordingly
represents
as
a
science
purely
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
he
sets
forth
the
anfangsgründe
der
he
asserts
in
fact
that
the
which
without
warrant
without
deduction
or
proof
of
any
sort
he
postulates
as
existing
is
furthermore
a
law
knowable
and
independent
of
all
or
it
he
says
on
conceptions
of
pure
reason
and
is
to
be
taken
as
a
synthetic
proposition
a
der
praktischen
of
fourth
edition
but
from
this
definition
the
implication
immediately
follows
that
such
a
law
can
only
be
formal
like
everything
else
known
and
consequently
has
only
to
do
with
the
of
actions
not
with
their
let
it
be
thought
what
this
means
he
emphatically
adds
vi
of
the
preface
to
the
that
it
is
useless
to
look
for
it
either
subjectively
in
man
nature
or
objectively
in
the
accidents
of
the
external
world
and
preface
of
the
same
page
vii
that
nothing
whatever
connected
with
it
can
be
borrowed
from
knowledge
relating
to
man
from
anthropology
on
page
he
repeats
that
one
ought
on
no
account
to
fall
into
the
mistake
of
trying
to
derive
one
principle
of
morality
from
the
special
constitution
of
human
nature
and
again
on
page
he
says
that
everything
derived
from
any
natural
disposition
peculiar
to
man
or
from
certain
feelings
and
propensities
or
indeed
from
any
special
trend
attaching
solely
to
human
nature
and
not
necessarily
to
be
taken
as
the
will
of
rational
is
incapable
of
affording
a
foundation
for
the
moral
law
this
shows
beyond
all
possibility
of
contradiction
that
kant
does
not
represent
the
alleged
moral
law
as
a
of
capable
of
empirical
proof
which
is
how
the
later
philosophers
both
individually
and
collectively
wish
to
pass
it
off
in
discarding
every
empirical
basis
for
morals
he
rejects
all
internal
and
still
more
decidedly
all
external
accordingly
he
founds
and
i
call
special
attention
to
this
his
moral
principle
not
on
any
provable
of
such
as
an
inner
natural
disposition
nor
yet
upon
any
objective
relation
of
things
in
the
external
world
no
that
would
be
an
empirical
foundation
instead
of
this
conceptions
a
conceptions
which
so
far
contain
nothing
derived
from
internal
or
external
experience
and
thus
are
simply
shells
without
kernels
these
are
to
be
made
the
basis
of
morals
let
us
consider
the
full
meaning
of
such
a
position
human
consciousness
as
well
as
the
whole
external
world
together
with
all
the
experience
and
all
the
facts
they
comprise
are
swept
from
under
our
feet
we
have
nothing
to
stand
upon
and
what
have
we
to
hold
to
nothing
but
a
few
entirely
abstract
entirely
unsubstantial
conceptions
floating
in
the
air
equally
with
ourselves
it
is
from
these
or
more
correctly
from
the
mere
form
of
their
connection
with
judgments
made
that
a
is
declared
to
proceed
which
by
is
supposed
to
be
valid
and
to
be
strong
enough
to
lay
bit
and
bridle
on
the
surging
throng
of
human
desires
on
the
storm
of
passion
on
the
giant
might
of
we
shall
see
if
such
be
the
case
with
this
preconceived
notion
that
the
basis
of
morals
must
be
necessarily
and
strictly
a
priori
and
entirely
free
from
everything
empirical
another
of
kant
favourite
ideas
is
closely
connected
the
moral
principle
that
he
seeks
to
establish
is
he
says
a
proposition
a
priori
of
merely
formal
and
hence
exclusively
a
matter
of
and
accordingly
as
such
to
be
regarded
as
valid
only
for
but
for
possible
rational
indeed
he
declares
it
to
hold
good
for
man
on
this
account
alone
because
man
comes
under
the
category
of
rational
beings
here
lies
the
cause
of
his
basing
the
moral
principle
not
on
any
feeling
but
on
which
knows
nothing
but
itself
and
the
statement
of
its
antithesis
so
that
this
is
taken
not
as
it
really
and
exclusively
is
an
intellectual
faculty
of
man
but
a
hypostatic
yet
without
the
smallest
authority
the
pernicious
effects
of
such
example
and
precedent
being
sufficiently
shown
in
the
pitiful
philosophy
of
the
present
day
indeed
this
view
of
morals
as
existing
not
for
men
as
men
but
for
all
rational
beings
as
such
is
with
kant
a
principle
so
firmly
established
an
idea
so
favourite
that
he
is
never
tired
of
repeating
it
at
every
opportunity
i
on
the
contrary
maintain
that
we
are
never
entitled
to
raise
into
a
that
which
we
only
know
of
in
a
single
species
for
we
could
bring
nothing
into
our
idea
of
the
but
what
we
had
abstracted
from
this
one
species
so
that
what
we
should
predicate
of
the
could
after
all
only
be
understood
of
the
single
species
while
if
we
should
attempt
to
think
away
without
any
warrant
the
particular
attributes
of
the
species
in
order
to
form
our
we
should
perhaps
remove
the
exact
condition
whereby
the
remaining
attributes
hypostatised
as
a
are
made
possible
just
as
we
recognise
in
to
be
an
attribute
of
animal
beings
alone
and
are
therefore
never
justified
in
thinking
of
it
as
existing
outside
and
independent
of
animal
nature
so
we
recognise
as
the
exclusive
attribute
of
the
human
race
and
have
not
the
smallest
right
to
suppose
that
reason
exists
externally
to
it
and
then
proceed
to
set
up
a
called
rational
beings
differing
from
its
single
known
species
man
still
less
are
we
warranted
in
laying
down
laws
for
such
imaginary
beings
in
the
to
talk
of
rational
beings
external
to
men
is
like
talking
of
external
to
bodies
one
can
not
help
suspecting
that
kant
was
thinking
a
little
of
the
dear
cherubim
or
at
any
rate
counted
on
their
presence
in
the
conviction
of
the
reader
in
any
case
this
doctrine
contains
a
tacit
assumption
of
an
rationalis
which
as
being
entirely
different
from
the
and
the
is
supposed
to
persist
after
death
and
then
to
be
indeed
nothing
else
but
but
in
the
der
reinen
kant
himself
has
expressly
and
elaborately
made
an
end
of
this
most
transcendent
hypostasis
nevertheless
in
his
ethics
generally
and
in
the
der
praktischen
especially
there
seems
always
to
hover
in
the
background
the
thought
that
the
inner
and
eternal
essence
of
man
consists
of
in
this
connection
where
the
matter
only
occurs
incidentally
i
must
content
myself
with
simply
asserting
the
contrary
reason
as
indeed
the
intellectual
faculty
as
a
whole
is
secondary
is
an
attribute
of
phaenomena
being
in
point
of
fact
conditioned
by
the
organism
whereas
it
is
the
in
man
which
is
his
very
self
the
only
part
of
him
which
is
metaphysical
and
therefore
indestructible
the
success
with
which
kant
had
applied
his
method
to
the
theoretical
side
of
philosophy
led
him
on
to
extend
it
to
the
practical
here
also
he
endeavoured
to
separate
pure
from
empirical
knowledge
for
this
purpose
he
assumed
that
just
as
we
know
the
laws
of
space
of
time
and
of
causality
so
in
like
manner
or
at
any
rate
analogously
we
have
the
moral
for
our
conduct
given
us
prior
to
all
experience
and
revealed
in
a
categorical
imperative
an
absolute
ought
but
how
wide
is
the
difference
between
this
alleged
moral
law
and
our
theoretical
knowledge
of
space
time
and
causality
the
latter
are
nothing
but
the
expression
of
the
forms
the
functions
of
our
intellect
whereby
alone
we
are
capable
of
grasping
an
objective
world
and
wherein
alone
it
can
be
mirrored
so
that
the
world
as
we
know
it
is
absolutely
conditioned
by
these
forms
and
all
experience
invariably
and
exactly
correspond
to
them
just
as
everything
that
i
see
through
a
blue
glass
must
appear
blue
while
the
former
the
moral
law
is
something
that
experience
pours
ridicule
on
at
every
step
indeed
as
kant
himself
says
it
is
doubtful
whether
in
practice
it
has
ever
really
been
followed
on
any
single
occasion
how
completely
unlike
are
the
things
which
are
here
classed
together
under
the
conception
of
moreover
kant
overlooked
the
fact
that
according
to
his
own
teaching
in
theoretical
philosophy
it
is
exactly
the
of
our
knowledge
of
time
space
and
causality
independent
as
this
is
of
experience
that
limits
it
strictly
to
phaenomena
to
the
picture
of
the
world
as
reflected
in
our
consciousness
and
makes
it
entirely
invalid
as
regards
the
real
nature
of
things
as
regards
whatever
exists
independently
of
our
capacity
to
grasp
it
similarly
when
we
turn
to
practical
philosophy
his
alleged
moral
law
if
it
have
an
origin
in
ourselves
must
also
be
only
phaenomenal
and
leave
entirely
untouched
the
essential
nature
of
things
only
this
conclusion
would
stand
in
the
sharpest
contradiction
as
much
to
the
facts
themselves
as
to
kant
view
of
them
for
it
is
precisely
the
moral
principle
in
us
that
he
everywhere
kritik
der
praktischen
represents
as
being
in
the
closest
connection
with
the
real
essence
of
things
indeed
as
directly
in
contact
with
it
and
in
all
passages
in
the
der
reinen
vernunft
where
the
mysterious
thing
in
itself
comes
forward
a
little
more
clearly
it
shows
itself
as
the
in
us
as
but
of
this
he
failed
to
take
account
in
chapter
ii
of
this
part
i
explained
how
kant
took
over
bodily
from
theological
morals
the
of
ethics
the
conception
of
obligation
of
law
and
of
duty
and
how
at
the
same
time
he
was
constrained
to
leave
behind
that
which
in
the
realm
of
theology
alone
lends
force
and
significance
to
these
ideas
but
he
felt
the
need
of
some
basis
for
them
and
accordingly
went
so
far
as
to
require
that
the
of
itself
should
be
also
the
of
its
in
other
words
that
it
should
itself
be
its
own
enforcement
an
action
he
says
has
no
genuine
moral
worth
unless
it
be
done
simply
as
a
matter
of
duty
and
for
duty
sake
without
any
liking
for
it
being
felt
and
the
character
only
begins
to
have
value
if
a
man
who
has
no
sympathy
in
his
heart
and
is
cold
and
indifferent
to
others
sufferings
and
who
is
by
nature
a
lover
of
his
is
nevertheless
a
doer
of
good
actions
solely
out
of
a
pitiful
sense
of
duty
this
assertion
which
is
revolting
to
true
moral
sentiment
this
apotheosis
of
lovelessness
the
exact
opposite
as
it
is
of
the
christian
doctrine
of
morals
which
places
love
before
everything
else
and
teaches
that
without
it
nothing
profiteth
cor
xiii
this
stupid
moral
pedantry
has
been
ridiculed
by
schiller
in
two
apposite
epigrams
entitled
scruples
of
conscience
and
decision
it
appears
that
some
passages
in
the
der
praktischen
which
exactly
suit
this
connection
were
the
immediate
occasion
of
the
verses
thus
for
instance
on
we
find
obedience
to
the
moral
law
which
a
man
feels
incumbent
on
him
is
based
not
on
voluntary
inclination
nor
on
endeavour
willingly
put
forth
without
any
authoritative
command
but
on
a
sense
of
duty
yes
it
must
be
commanded
what
slavish
morality
and
again
on
feelings
of
compassion
and
of
sympathy
would
be
actually
troublesome
to
persons
who
think
aright
because
through
such
emotions
their
well
weighed
maxims
would
become
confused
and
so
the
desire
would
grow
up
to
be
rid
of
them
and
to
be
subject
solely
to
the
lawgiver
reason
now
i
maintain
without
hesitation
that
what
opens
the
hand
of
the
loveless
doer
of
good
who
is
indifferent
to
the
sufferings
of
other
people
can
not
provided
he
have
no
secondary
motives
be
anything
else
than
a
slavish
fear
of
the
gods
equally
whether
he
calls
his
fetich
categorical
imperative
or
fitzlipuzli
for
what
but
fear
can
move
a
hard
heart
furthermore
on
in
accordance
with
the
above
view
we
find
that
the
moral
worth
of
an
action
is
supposed
to
lie
by
no
means
in
the
which
led
to
it
but
in
the
maxim
which
was
followed
whereas
i
on
the
contrary
ask
the
reader
to
reflect
that
it
is
the
which
decides
as
to
the
moral
worth
or
worthlessness
off
an
action
so
that
the
same
act
may
deserve
condemnation
or
praise
according
to
the
intention
which
determined
it
hence
it
is
that
whenever
men
discuss
a
proceeding
to
which
some
moral
importance
is
attached
the
is
always
investigated
and
by
this
standard
alone
the
matter
is
judged
as
likewise
it
is
in
the
alone
that
every
one
seeks
justification
if
he
see
his
conduct
misinterpreted
or
excuse
if
its
consequence
be
mischievous
on
we
at
last
reach
the
definition
of
duty
which
is
the
fundamental
conception
of
kant
entire
ethical
system
it
is
the
necessity
of
an
action
out
of
respect
for
the
law
but
what
is
takes
place
with
absolute
certainty
while
conduct
based
on
pure
duty
generally
does
not
come
off
at
all
and
not
only
this
kant
himself
admits
that
there
are
certain
on
record
of
conduct
determined
solely
by
pure
duty
and
on
he
says
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
know
with
certainty
from
experience
whether
there
has
ever
really
been
one
single
case
in
which
an
action
however
true
to
duty
has
rested
simply
on
its
idea
and
similarly
on
and
in
what
sense
then
can
be
attributed
to
such
an
action
as
it
is
only
fair
always
to
put
the
most
favourable
interpretation
on
an
author
words
we
will
suppose
him
to
mean
that
an
act
true
to
duty
is
necessary
but
accidental
only
it
is
precisely
this
that
is
more
easily
said
than
thought
for
where
is
the
of
this
necessity
the
consequence
of
which
for
the
most
part
perhaps
indeed
always
fails
to
be
realised
in
objective
reality
with
every
wish
to
be
unbiassed
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
expression
of
an
is
nothing
but
an
artificially
concealed
very
forced
paraphrase
of
the
word
ought
this
will
become
clearer
if
we
notice
that
in
the
same
definition
the
word
respect
is
employed
where
obedience
is
meant
similarly
in
the
note
on
we
read
signifies
simply
the
subordination
of
my
will
to
a
law
the
direct
determination
of
the
will
by
a
law
and
the
consciousness
that
it
is
so
determined
this
is
what
is
denoted
by
in
what
language
in
german
the
proper
term
is
but
the
word
so
unsuitable
as
it
is
can
not
without
a
reason
have
been
put
in
place
of
the
word
it
must
serve
some
purpose
and
this
is
obviously
none
other
than
to
veil
the
derivation
of
the
imperative
form
and
of
the
conception
of
duty
from
theological
morals
just
as
we
saw
above
that
the
expression
necessity
of
an
action
which
is
such
a
forced
and
awkward
substitute
for
the
word
shall
was
only
chosen
because
shall
is
the
exact
language
of
the
decalogue
the
above
definition
duty
is
the
necessity
of
an
action
out
of
respect
for
the
law
would
therefore
read
in
natural
undisguised
plain
language
duty
signifies
an
action
which
to
be
done
out
of
obedience
to
a
law
this
is
the
real
form
of
the
poodle
but
now
as
to
the
law
which
is
the
real
foundation
stone
of
the
kantian
ethics
does
it
contain
and
where
is
it
inscribed
this
is
the
chief
point
of
inquiry
in
the
first
place
be
it
observed
that
we
have
two
questions
to
deal
with
the
one
has
to
do
with
the
the
other
with
the
of
ethics
two
entirely
different
things
although
they
are
frequently
and
sometimes
indeed
intentionally
confused
the
principle
or
main
proposition
of
an
ethical
system
is
the
shortest
and
most
concise
definition
of
the
line
of
conduct
which
it
prescribes
or
if
it
have
no
imperative
form
of
the
line
of
conduct
to
which
it
attaches
real
moral
worth
it
thus
contains
in
the
general
terms
of
a
single
enunciation
the
direction
for
following
the
path
of
virtue
which
is
derived
from
that
system
in
other
words
it
is
the
of
virtue
whereas
the
of
any
theory
of
ethics
is
the
of
virtue
the
of
the
obligation
enjoined
of
the
exhortation
or
praise
given
whether
it
be
sought
in
human
nature
or
in
the
external
conditions
of
the
world
or
in
anything
else
as
in
all
sciences
so
also
in
ethics
the
must
be
clearly
distinguished
from
the
but
most
teachers
of
morals
wilfully
confound
this
difference
probably
because
the
is
so
easy
the
so
exceedingly
difficult
to
give
they
are
therefore
glad
to
try
to
make
up
for
the
poverty
on
the
one
hand
by
the
riches
on
the
other
and
to
bring
about
a
happy
marriage
between
poverty
and
plenty
by
putting
them
together
in
one
proposition
this
is
generally
done
by
taking
the
familiar
out
of
the
simple
form
in
which
it
can
be
expressed
and
forcing
it
into
an
artificial
formula
from
which
it
is
only
to
be
deduced
as
the
conclusion
of
given
premises
and
the
reader
is
led
by
this
performance
to
feel
as
if
he
had
grasped
not
only
the
thing
but
its
cause
as
well
we
may
easily
convince
ourselves
of
this
by
recalling
all
the
most
familiar
principles
of
morals
as
however
in
what
follows
i
have
no
intention
of
imitating
acrobatic
tricks
of
this
sort
but
purpose
proceeding
with
all
honesty
and
straightforwardness
i
can
not
make
the
principle
of
ethics
equivalent
to
its
basis
but
must
keep
the
two
quite
separate
accordingly
this
the
principle
the
fundamental
proposition
as
to
which
in
its
essence
all
teachers
of
morals
are
really
at
one
however
much
they
may
clothe
it
in
different
costumes
i
shall
at
once
express
in
the
form
which
i
take
to
be
the
simplest
and
purest
possible
neminem
laede
immo
omnes
quantum
potes
do
harm
to
no
one
but
rather
help
all
people
as
far
as
lies
in
your
power
this
is
in
truth
the
proposition
which
all
ethical
writers
expend
their
energies
in
endeavouring
to
account
for
it
is
the
common
result
of
their
manifold
and
widely
differing
deductions
it
is
the
for
which
the
is
still
sought
after
the
consequence
the
cause
of
which
is
wanting
hence
it
is
itself
nothing
but
the
the
thing
given
in
relation
to
which
the
the
thing
required
is
the
problem
of
every
ethical
system
as
also
of
the
present
prize
essay
the
solution
of
this
riddle
will
disclose
the
real
foundation
of
ethics
which
like
the
philosopher
stone
has
been
searched
for
from
time
immemorial
that
the
the
the
principle
is
most
purely
expressed
by
the
enunciation
i
have
given
can
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
it
stands
to
every
other
precept
of
morals
as
a
conclusion
to
given
premises
and
therefore
constitutes
the
real
goal
it
is
desired
to
attain
so
that
all
other
ethical
commandments
can
only
be
regarded
as
paraphrases
as
indirect
or
disguised
statements
of
the
above
simple
proposition
this
is
true
for
instance
even
of
that
trite
and
apparently
elementary
maxim
tibi
fieri
non
vis
alteri
ne
do
not
to
another
what
you
are
unwilling
should
be
done
to
yourself
the
defect
here
is
that
the
wording
only
touches
the
duties
imposed
by
law
not
those
required
by
virtue
a
thing
which
can
be
easily
remedied
by
the
omission
of
and
thus
changed
it
really
means
nothing
else
than
laede
immo
omnes
quantum
potes
but
as
this
sense
is
only
reached
by
a
periphrasis
the
formula
gains
the
appearance
of
having
also
revealed
its
own
ultimate
foundation
its
which
however
is
not
the
case
because
it
does
not
in
the
least
follow
that
if
i
am
unwilling
that
something
be
done
to
myself
i
ought
not
to
do
it
to
others
the
same
is
true
of
every
other
principle
or
leading
proposition
of
ethics
that
has
hitherto
been
put
forward
if
we
now
return
to
the
above
question
how
does
the
law
read
in
obeying
which
according
to
kant
duty
consists
and
on
what
is
it
based
we
shall
find
that
our
philosopher
like
most
others
has
in
an
extremely
artificial
manner
closely
connected
the
principle
of
morals
with
its
basis
i
again
call
attention
to
what
i
have
already
examined
at
the
outset
i
mean
the
kantian
claim
that
the
principle
of
ethics
must
be
purely
and
purely
formal
indeed
an
synthetical
proposition
which
consequently
may
not
contain
anything
material
nor
rest
upon
anything
empirical
whether
objectively
in
the
external
world
or
subjectively
in
consciousness
such
as
any
feeling
inclination
impulse
and
the
like
kant
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
this
position
for
on
he
says
it
will
be
seen
that
philosophy
has
here
indeed
reached
a
precarious
standpoint
which
yet
is
to
be
immovable
notwithstanding
that
it
is
neither
dependent
on
nor
supported
by
anything
in
heaven
or
on
earth
we
shall
therefore
with
all
the
greater
interest
and
curiosity
await
the
solution
of
the
problem
he
has
set
himself
namely
how
something
is
to
arise
out
of
nothing
that
is
how
out
of
purely
conceptions
which
contain
nothing
empirical
or
material
the
laws
of
material
human
action
are
to
grow
up
this
is
a
process
which
we
may
find
symbolised
in
chemistry
where
out
of
three
invisible
gases
azote
hydrogen
and
chlorine
and
thus
in
apparently
empty
space
solid
is
evolved
before
our
eyes
i
will
however
explain
more
clearly
than
kant
either
would
or
could
the
method
whereby
he
accomplishes
this
difficult
task
the
demonstration
is
all
the
more
necessary
because
what
he
did
appears
to
be
seldom
properly
understood
almost
all
kant
disciples
have
fallen
into
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
he
presents
his
categorical
imperative
directly
as
a
fact
of
consciousness
but
in
that
case
its
origin
would
be
anthropological
and
as
resting
on
experience
although
internal
it
would
have
an
empirical
basis
a
position
which
runs
directly
counter
to
the
kantian
view
and
which
he
repeatedly
rejects
thus
on
he
says
it
can
not
be
empirically
determined
whether
any
such
categorical
imperative
exists
everywhere
and
again
on
the
possibility
of
the
categorical
imperative
must
be
investigated
entirely
on
grounds
because
here
we
are
not
helped
by
any
testimony
of
experience
as
to
its
reality
even
reinhold
his
first
pupil
missed
this
point
for
in
his
zur
uebersicht
der
philosophie
am
anfange
no
we
find
him
saying
kant
assumes
the
moral
law
to
be
a
direct
and
certain
reality
an
original
fact
of
the
moral
consciousness
but
if
kant
had
wished
to
make
the
categorical
imperative
a
fact
of
consciousness
and
thus
give
it
an
empirical
foundation
he
certainly
would
not
have
failed
at
least
to
put
it
forward
as
such
and
this
is
precisely
what
he
never
does
as
far
as
i
know
the
categorical
imperative
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
der
reinen
of
the
first
and
of
the
fifth
edition
entirely
ex
nunc
unexpectedly
without
any
preamble
and
merely
connected
with
the
preceding
sentence
by
an
altogether
unjustifiable
therefore
it
is
only
in
the
zur
metaphysik
der
a
book
to
which
we
here
devote
especial
attention
that
it
is
first
introduced
expressly
and
formally
as
a
deduction
from
certain
concepts
whereas
in
reinhold
concordiae
des
we
actually
read
on
the
following
sentence
we
distinguish
moral
from
the
with
which
it
as
an
original
fact
transcending
all
knowledge
is
bound
up
in
the
human
consciousness
and
we
understand
by
such
the
consciousness
of
that
is
of
the
we
are
under
of
admitting
the
legitimacy
whether
pleasurable
or
the
reverse
of
the
will
as
the
stimulus
and
as
the
measure
of
its
own
operations
this
would
of
course
be
a
charming
with
a
very
pretty
to
boot
but
seriously
into
what
an
outrageous
do
we
find
kant
moral
law
here
developed
if
were
true
ethics
would
indubitably
have
a
basis
of
incomparable
solidity
and
there
would
be
no
need
of
any
questions
being
set
for
prize
essays
to
encourage
inquiry
in
this
direction
but
the
greatest
marvel
would
be
that
men
had
been
so
slow
in
discovering
such
a
fact
of
consciousness
considering
that
for
the
space
of
thousands
of
years
a
basis
for
morals
has
been
sought
after
with
zealous
patient
toil
how
kant
himself
is
responsible
for
this
deplorable
mistake
i
shall
explain
further
on
nevertheless
one
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
undisputed
predominance
of
such
a
radical
error
among
his
disciples
have
they
never
whilst
writing
all
their
numberless
books
on
the
kantian
philosophy
noticed
the
disfigurement
which
the
der
reinen
underwent
in
the
second
edition
and
which
made
it
an
incoherent
work
it
seems
that
this
has
only
now
come
to
light
and
in
my
opinion
the
fact
has
been
quite
correctly
analysed
in
rosenkranz
preface
to
the
second
volume
of
his
complete
edition
of
kant
works
we
must
however
remember
that
many
scholars
being
unceasingly
occupied
as
teachers
and
authors
find
very
little
time
left
for
private
and
exact
research
it
is
certain
that
i
learn
by
teaching
is
not
unconditionally
true
sometimes
indeed
one
is
tempted
to
parody
it
by
saying
docendo
nihil
by
always
teaching
i
learn
nothing
and
even
what
diderot
puts
into
the
mouth
of
nephew
is
not
altogether
without
reason
as
for
these
teachers
do
you
suppose
they
understand
the
sciences
they
give
instruction
in
not
a
bit
of
it
my
dear
sir
not
a
bit
of
it
if
they
possessed
sufficient
knowledge
to
be
able
to
teach
them
they
would
not
do
so
they
would
have
devoted
their
lives
to
the
study
of
them
goethe
translation
p
lichtenberg
too
says
i
have
rather
observed
that
professional
people
are
often
exactly
those
who
do
not
know
best
but
to
return
to
the
kantian
ethics
most
persons
provided
only
the
conclusion
reached
agrees
with
their
moral
feelings
immediately
assume
that
there
is
no
flaw
to
be
found
in
its
derivation
and
if
the
process
of
deduction
looks
difficult
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
much
about
it
but
are
content
to
trust
the
faculty
thus
the
foundation
which
kant
gave
to
his
moral
law
by
no
means
consists
in
its
being
proved
empirically
to
be
a
fact
of
consciousness
neither
does
he
base
it
on
an
appeal
to
moral
feeling
nor
yet
on
a
under
its
fine
modern
name
of
an
absolute
postulate
it
is
formed
rather
of
a
very
subtle
process
of
thought
which
he
twice
advances
on
and
and
and
which
i
shall
now
proceed
to
make
clear
kant
be
it
observed
ridiculed
all
empirical
stimuli
of
the
will
and
began
by
removing
everything
whether
subjective
or
objective
on
which
a
law
determining
the
will
action
could
be
empirically
based
the
consequence
is
that
he
has
nothing
left
for
the
substance
of
his
law
but
simply
its
now
this
can
only
be
the
abstract
conception
of
but
the
conception
of
lawfulness
is
built
up
out
of
what
is
valid
for
all
persons
equally
therefore
the
substance
of
the
law
consists
of
the
conception
of
what
is
universally
valid
and
its
contents
are
of
course
nothing
else
than
its
hence
the
formula
will
read
as
follows
act
only
in
accordance
with
that
precept
which
you
can
also
wish
should
be
a
general
law
for
all
rational
beings
this
then
is
the
real
foundation
for
the
most
part
so
greatly
misunderstood
which
kant
constructed
for
his
principle
of
morals
and
therefore
for
his
whole
ethical
system
compare
also
the
der
praktischen
the
end
of
note
i
pay
kant
a
tribute
of
sincere
admiration
for
the
great
acumen
he
displayed
in
carrying
out
this
dexterous
feat
but
i
continue
in
all
seriousness
my
examination
of
his
position
according
to
the
standard
of
truth
i
will
only
observe
and
this
point
i
shall
take
up
again
later
on
that
here
because
and
in
so
far
as
it
works
out
the
above
explained
special
ratiocination
receives
the
name
of
now
the
categorical
imperative
of
practical
reason
is
the
law
which
results
from
this
process
of
thought
consequently
practical
reason
is
not
in
the
least
what
most
people
including
even
fichte
have
regarded
it
a
special
faculty
that
can
not
be
traced
to
its
source
a
a
sort
of
moral
instinct
like
hutcheson
moral
sense
but
it
is
as
kant
himself
in
his
preface
xii
and
elsewhere
often
enough
declares
one
and
the
same
with
is
in
fact
itself
in
so
far
as
the
latter
works
out
the
ratiocinative
process
i
have
described
it
is
noticeable
that
fichte
calls
the
categorical
imperative
of
kant
an
der
gesammten
tübingen
note
this
is
the
modern
more
showy
expression
for
and
thus
we
see
that
he
too
regularly
accepted
the
categorical
imperative
and
consequently
must
be
included
among
those
who
have
fallen
into
the
mistake
above
criticised
the
objection
to
which
this
kantian
basis
of
morals
is
at
once
and
directly
exposed
lies
in
the
fact
that
such
an
origin
of
a
moral
law
in
us
is
impossible
because
of
its
assumption
that
man
would
quite
of
his
own
accord
hit
on
the
idea
of
looking
about
for
and
inquiring
after
a
law
to
which
his
will
should
be
subject
and
which
should
shape
its
actions
this
procedure
however
can
not
possibly
occur
to
him
of
itself
at
best
it
could
only
be
after
another
moral
stimulus
had
supplied
the
first
impulse
and
motive
thereto
and
such
a
stimulus
would
have
to
be
positively
operative
and
real
and
show
itself
to
be
such
as
well
as
spontaneously
influence
indeed
force
its
presence
upon
the
mind
but
anything
of
this
sort
would
run
counter
to
assumption
which
according
to
the
chain
of
reasoning
above
described
is
to
be
regarded
as
itself
the
origin
of
all
moral
conceptions
in
fact
the
of
morality
consequently
as
long
as
there
is
no
such
antecedent
incentive
because
there
exists
no
other
moral
stimulus
but
the
process
of
thought
already
explained
so
long
egoism
alone
must
remain
as
the
of
human
conduct
as
the
guiding
thread
of
the
law
of
motivation
so
long
the
entirely
empirical
and
egoistic
motives
of
the
moment
alone
and
unchecked
must
determine
in
each
separate
case
the
conduct
of
a
man
since
on
this
assumption
there
is
no
voice
to
arrest
him
neither
does
any
reason
whatever
exist
why
he
should
be
minded
to
inquire
after
to
say
nothing
of
anxiously
searching
for
a
law
which
should
limit
and
govern
his
will
and
yet
it
is
only
possible
on
this
supposition
that
he
should
think
out
the
above
remarkable
piece
of
mental
legerdemain
it
matters
not
how
far
we
may
care
to
put
a
strict
and
exact
interpretation
on
this
kantian
process
or
whether
we
choose
to
tone
it
down
to
some
dim
obscurely
felt
operation
of
thought
no
modification
of
it
can
attack
the
primary
truths
that
out
of
nothing
nothing
comes
and
that
an
effect
requires
a
cause
the
moral
stimulus
like
every
motive
that
effects
the
will
must
in
all
cases
make
itself
felt
spontaneously
and
therefore
have
a
positive
working
and
consequently
be
real
and
because
for
men
the
only
thing
which
has
reality
is
the
empirical
or
else
that
which
is
supposed
to
have
a
possibly
empirical
existence
therefore
it
follows
that
the
moral
stimulus
can
not
but
be
empirical
and
show
itself
as
such
of
its
own
accord
and
without
waiting
for
us
to
begin
our
search
it
must
come
and
press
itself
upon
us
and
this
with
such
force
that
it
may
at
least
possibly
overcome
the
opposing
egoistic
motives
in
all
their
giant
strength
for
ethics
has
to
do
with
actual
human
conduct
and
not
with
the
building
of
card
houses
a
performance
which
yields
results
that
no
man
would
ever
turn
to
in
the
stern
stress
and
battle
of
life
and
which
in
face
of
the
storm
of
our
passions
would
be
about
as
serviceable
as
a
syringe
in
a
great
fire
i
have
already
noticed
above
how
kant
considered
it
a
special
merit
of
his
moral
law
that
it
is
founded
solely
on
abstract
pure
conceptions
consequently
on
whereby
its
validity
obtains
he
says
not
only
for
men
but
for
all
rational
beings
as
such
all
the
more
must
we
regret
that
pure
abstract
conceptions
without
real
contents
and
without
any
kind
of
empirical
basis
can
never
move
at
any
rate
men
of
other
rational
beings
i
am
of
course
incapable
of
speaking
the
second
defect
then
in
kant
ethical
basis
is
its
lack
of
real
substance
so
far
this
has
escaped
notice
because
the
real
nature
of
his
foundation
has
in
all
probability
been
thoroughly
understood
only
by
an
exceedingly
small
number
of
those
who
were
its
enthusiastic
propagandists
the
second
fault
i
repeat
is
entire
want
of
reality
and
hence
of
possible
efficacy
the
structure
floats
in
the
air
like
a
web
of
the
subtlest
conceptions
devoid
of
all
contents
it
is
based
on
nothing
and
can
therefore
support
nothing
and
move
nothing
and
yet
kant
loaded
it
with
a
burden
of
enormous
weight
namely
the
hypothesis
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
in
spite
of
his
oft
declared
conviction
that
freedom
in
human
action
has
absolutely
no
place
that
theoretically
not
even
its
possibility
is
thinkable
der
praktischen
that
if
the
character
of
a
man
and
all
the
motives
which
work
on
him
were
exactly
known
his
conduct
could
be
calculated
as
certainly
and
as
precisely
as
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
he
nevertheless
makes
an
assumption
of
freedom
although
only
and
as
a
postulate
by
his
celebrated
conclusion
you
can
because
you
ought
and
this
on
the
strength
of
his
precious
ethical
basis
which
as
we
see
floats
in
the
air
incorporeal
but
if
it
has
once
been
clearly
recognised
that
a
thing
and
can
not
what
is
the
use
of
all
the
postulates
in
the
world
it
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
to
cast
away
that
on
which
the
postulate
is
based
because
it
is
an
impossible
supposition
and
this
course
would
be
justified
by
the
rule
non
posse
ad
non
esse
valet
and
by
a
ad
which
would
at
the
same
time
be
fatal
to
the
categorical
imperative
instead
of
which
one
false
doctrine
is
built
up
on
the
other
the
inadmissibility
of
a
basis
for
morals
consisting
of
a
few
entirely
abstract
and
empty
conceptions
must
have
been
apparent
to
kant
himself
in
secret
for
in
the
der
praktischen
where
as
i
have
already
said
he
is
not
so
strict
and
methodical
in
his
work
and
where
we
find
him
becoming
bolder
on
account
of
the
fame
he
had
gained
it
is
remarkable
how
the
ethical
basis
gradually
changes
its
nature
and
almost
forgets
that
it
is
a
mere
web
of
abstract
ideas
in
fact
it
seems
distinctly
desirous
of
becoming
more
substantial
thus
for
instance
on
of
the
above
work
are
the
words
the
moral
law
some
sort
a
fact
of
pure
what
is
one
to
think
of
this
extraordinary
expression
in
every
other
place
that
which
is
fact
is
opposed
to
what
is
knowable
by
pure
reason
similarly
on
we
read
of
a
reason
which
directly
determines
the
will
and
so
on
now
let
us
remember
that
in
laying
his
foundation
kant
expressly
and
repeatedly
rejects
every
anthropological
basis
everything
that
could
prove
the
categorical
imperative
to
be
a
fact
of
consciousness
because
such
a
proof
would
be
empirical
nevertheless
his
successors
were
so
emboldened
by
incidental
utterances
like
the
above
that
they
went
to
much
greater
lengths
fichte
in
his
work
der
warns
us
expressly
not
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
misled
into
trying
to
explain
and
derive
from
external
sources
the
consciousness
that
we
have
duties
because
this
would
be
detrimental
to
the
dignity
and
absoluteness
of
the
law
a
very
nice
excuse
again
on
he
says
the
principle
of
morality
is
a
thought
which
is
based
on
the
of
the
absolute
activity
of
the
intelligence
and
which
is
directly
conceived
by
the
pure
intelligence
of
its
own
accord
what
a
fine
flourish
to
conceal
the
helplessness
of
this
whoever
may
like
to
convince
himself
how
kant
disciples
little
by
little
totally
forgot
and
ignored
the
real
nature
of
the
foundation
and
derivation
which
their
master
originally
gave
to
the
moral
law
should
read
a
very
interesting
essay
in
reinhold
zur
uebersicht
der
philosophie
im
anfange
no
in
it
on
pp
and
it
is
maintained
that
in
the
kantian
philosophy
autonomy
which
is
the
same
thing
as
the
categorical
imperative
is
a
fact
of
consciousness
and
can
not
be
traced
further
back
inasmuch
as
it
declares
itself
by
means
of
a
direct
consciousness
but
in
this
case
it
would
have
an
anthropological
and
consequently
empirical
foundation
a
position
which
is
diametrically
opposed
to
kant
explicit
and
repeated
utterances
again
on
we
find
both
in
the
practical
philosophy
of
criticism
and
in
the
whole
of
the
purified
or
higher
transcendental
philosophy
autonomy
is
that
which
is
founded
and
which
founds
by
itself
alone
and
which
is
neither
capable
of
nor
requires
any
other
foundation
it
is
that
which
is
absolutely
original
true
and
certain
se
the
primal
truth
the
κατ
ἐξοχήν
par
excellence
the
absolute
principle
whoever
therefore
imagines
requires
or
seeks
any
basis
for
this
autonomy
external
to
itself
can
only
be
regarded
by
the
kantian
school
as
wanting
in
moral
consciousness
or
else
as
failing
to
interpret
this
consciousness
correctly
through
the
employment
of
false
first
principles
in
his
speculations
the
school
of
fichte
and
schelling
declares
him
to
be
afflicted
with
a
dulness
of
intellect
that
renders
him
incapable
of
being
a
philosopher
and
forms
the
characteristic
of
the
unholy
and
the
sluggish
brute
or
to
use
more
veiled
expression
of
the
and
the
every
one
will
understand
how
much
truth
there
can
be
in
a
doctrine
which
it
is
sought
to
uphold
by
such
defiant
and
dogmatic
rhetoric
meanwhile
we
must
doubtless
explain
by
the
respect
that
this
language
inspired
the
really
childish
credulity
with
which
followers
accepted
the
categorical
imperative
and
at
once
treated
it
as
a
matter
beyond
dispute
the
truth
is
that
in
this
case
any
objections
raised
to
a
theoretical
assertion
might
easily
be
confounded
with
moral
obliquity
so
that
every
one
although
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
in
his
own
mind
of
the
categorical
imperative
yet
preferred
to
be
silent
believing
as
he
did
in
secret
that
others
were
probably
better
off
and
had
succeeded
in
evolving
a
clearer
and
more
definite
mental
picture
of
it
for
no
one
likes
to
turn
his
conscience
inside
out
thus
in
the
kantian
school
practical
reason
with
its
categorical
imperative
appears
more
and
more
as
a
hyperphysical
fact
as
a
delphian
temple
in
the
human
soul
out
of
whose
dark
recesses
proceed
oracles
that
infallibly
declare
not
alas
what
will
but
what
ought
to
happen
this
doctrine
of
practical
reason
as
a
direct
and
immediate
fact
once
it
had
been
adopted
or
rather
introduced
by
artifice
combined
with
defiance
was
unhappily
later
on
extended
also
to
theoretical
reason
and
not
unnaturally
for
kant
himself
had
often
said
that
both
are
but
one
and
the
same
reason
preface
xii
after
it
had
been
once
admitted
that
in
the
domain
of
the
practical
there
is
a
reason
which
dictates
it
was
an
easy
step
to
concede
the
same
privilege
to
theoretical
reason
also
closely
related
as
the
latter
is
to
the
former
indeed
consubstantial
with
it
the
one
was
thus
pronounced
to
be
just
as
immediate
as
the
other
the
advantage
of
this
being
no
less
immense
than
obvious
then
it
was
that
all
philosophasters
and
with
jacobi
the
denouncer
of
atheists
at
their
head
came
crowding
to
this
postern
which
was
so
unexpectedly
opened
to
them
they
wanted
to
bring
their
small
wares
to
market
or
at
least
to
save
what
they
most
valued
of
the
old
heirlooms
which
kant
teaching
threatened
to
pulverise
as
in
the
life
of
the
individual
a
single
youthful
mistake
often
ruins
the
whole
career
so
when
kant
made
that
one
false
assumption
of
a
practical
reason
furnished
with
credentials
exclusively
transcendent
and
like
the
supreme
courts
of
appeal
with
powers
of
decision
without
grounds
the
result
was
that
out
of
the
austere
gravity
of
the
critical
philosophy
was
evolved
a
teaching
utterly
heterogeneous
to
it
we
hear
of
a
reason
at
first
only
dimly
surmising
then
clearly
comprehending
the
supersensuous
and
at
last
endowed
with
a
perfect
intellectual
intuition
of
it
every
dreamer
could
now
promulgate
his
mental
freaks
as
the
absolute
officially
issued
deliverances
and
revelations
of
this
reason
nor
need
we
be
surprised
if
the
new
privilege
was
fully
taken
advantage
of
here
then
is
the
origin
of
that
philosophical
method
which
appeared
immediately
after
kant
and
which
is
made
up
of
of
mystification
of
imposture
of
deception
and
of
throwing
dust
in
the
eyes
this
era
will
be
known
one
day
in
the
history
of
philosophy
as
the
period
of
dishonesty
for
it
was
signalised
by
the
disappearance
of
the
characteristic
of
honesty
of
searching
after
truth
in
common
with
the
reader
which
was
well
marked
in
the
writings
of
all
previous
philosophers
the
philosophaster
object
was
not
to
instruct
but
to
befool
his
hearers
as
every
page
attests
at
first
fichte
and
schelling
shine
as
the
heroes
of
this
epoch
to
be
followed
by
the
man
who
is
quite
unworthy
even
of
them
and
greatly
their
inferior
in
point
of
talent
i
mean
the
stupid
and
clumsy
charlatan
hegel
the
chorus
is
composed
of
a
mixed
company
of
professors
of
philosophy
who
in
solemn
fashion
discourse
to
their
public
about
the
endless
the
absolute
and
many
other
matters
of
which
they
can
know
absolutely
nothing
as
a
to
raise
reason
to
her
prophetic
throne
a
wretched
was
actually
dragged
in
and
made
to
serve
it
was
asserted
that
as
the
word
reason
comes
from
to
comprehend
therefore
means
a
capacity
to
the
supersensuous
or
this
pretty
notion
met
with
boundless
approval
and
for
the
space
of
thirty
years
was
constantly
repeated
in
germany
with
immense
satisfaction
indeed
it
was
made
the
foundation
of
philosophic
manuals
and
yet
it
is
as
clear
as
that
of
course
reason
comes
from
to
comprehend
but
only
because
reason
makes
man
superior
to
animals
so
that
he
not
only
hears
but
also
by
no
means
what
is
going
on
in
but
what
is
said
as
by
one
reasonable
person
to
another
the
words
spoken
being
by
the
listener
and
this
capacity
is
called
such
is
the
interpretation
that
all
peoples
ages
and
languages
have
put
on
the
word
reason
it
has
always
been
understood
to
mean
the
possession
of
general
abstract
ideas
named
which
are
denoted
and
fixed
by
means
of
words
this
faculty
alone
it
is
which
in
reality
gives
to
men
their
advantage
over
animals
for
these
abstract
ideas
or
concepts
that
is
mental
impressions
formed
of
the
sum
of
many
separate
things
are
the
condition
of
and
through
it
of
actual
through
which
again
they
determine
the
consciousness
not
only
of
the
present
which
animals
also
have
but
of
the
past
and
the
future
as
such
whence
it
results
that
they
are
the
so
to
say
of
clear
recollection
of
circumspection
of
foresight
and
of
intention
the
constant
factor
in
the
evolution
of
systematic
of
the
state
of
trades
arts
sciences
religions
and
philosophies
in
short
of
everything
that
so
sharply
distinguishes
human
from
animal
life
beasts
have
only
intuitive
ideas
and
therefore
also
only
intuitive
motives
consequently
the
dependence
of
their
volition
ou
motives
is
manifest
with
man
this
dependence
is
no
less
a
fact
he
too
with
due
allowance
for
individual
character
is
affected
by
motives
under
the
strictest
law
of
necessity
only
these
are
for
the
most
part
not
but
ideas
that
is
conceptions
or
thoughts
which
nevertheless
are
the
result
of
previous
intuitions
hence
of
external
influences
this
however
gives
him
a
relative
freedom
relative
that
is
as
compared
with
an
animal
for
his
action
is
not
determined
as
it
is
in
all
other
creatures
by
the
surroundings
of
the
moment
as
intuitively
perceived
but
by
the
thoughts
he
has
derived
from
experience
or
gained
by
instruction
consequently
the
motive
by
which
he
too
is
necessarily
swayed
is
not
always
at
once
obvious
to
the
simultaneously
with
the
act
it
lies
concealed
in
the
brain
it
is
this
that
lends
to
all
his
movements
as
well
as
to
his
conduct
and
work
as
a
whole
a
character
manifestly
different
from
that
observable
in
the
habits
of
beasts
he
seems
as
though
guided
by
finer
invisible
threads
whence
all
his
acts
bear
the
stamp
of
deliberation
and
premeditation
thus
gaining
an
appearance
of
independence
which
sufficiently
distinguishes
them
from
those
of
animals
all
these
great
differences
however
spring
solely
out
of
the
capacity
for
ideas
this
capacity
is
therefore
the
essential
part
of
that
is
of
the
faculty
peculiar
to
man
and
it
is
called
λογιστικον
la
ragione
il
discorso
raison
reason
discourse
of
if
i
were
asked
what
the
distinction
is
between
it
and
entendement
i
should
reply
thus
the
latter
is
that
capacity
for
knowledge
which
animals
also
possess
in
varying
degrees
and
which
is
seen
in
us
at
its
highest
development
in
other
words
it
is
the
direct
consciousness
of
the
law
of
a
consciousness
which
precedes
experience
being
constituted
by
the
very
form
of
the
understanding
whose
essential
nature
is
in
fact
therein
contained
on
it
depends
in
the
first
place
the
intuitive
perception
of
the
external
world
for
the
senses
by
themselves
are
only
capable
of
a
thing
which
is
very
far
from
being
indeed
the
former
is
nothing
but
the
material
of
the
latter
ὁρᾷ

καὶ

the
mind
hears
everything
else
is
deaf
and
blind
is
the
result
of
our
directly
referring
the
impressions
of
the
to
their
cause
which
exactly
because
of
this
act
of
the
intelligence
presents
itself
as
an
under
the
mode
of
intuition
proper
to
us
in
this
is
a
proof
that
the
law
of
causality
is
known
to
us
and
does
not
arise
from
experience
since
experience
itself
inasmuch
as
it
presupposes
intuitive
perception
is
only
possible
through
the
same
law
all
the
higher
qualities
of
the
intellect
all
cleverness
sagacity
penetration
acumen
are
directly
proportional
to
the
exactness
and
fulness
with
which
the
workings
of
causality
in
all
its
relations
are
grasped
for
all
knowledge
of
the
of
things
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
is
based
on
the
comprehension
of
this
law
and
the
clearness
and
accuracy
with
which
it
is
understood
is
the
measure
of
one
man
superiority
to
another
in
shrewdness
cunning
on
the
other
hand
the
epithet
has
at
all
times
been
applied
to
the
man
who
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
guided
by
intuitive
impressions
but
by
and
and
who
therefore
always
sets
to
work
logically
after
due
reflection
and
forethought
conduct
of
this
sort
is
everywhere
known
as
not
that
this
by
any
means
implies
uprightness
and
love
for
one
fellows
on
the
contrary
it
is
quite
possible
to
act
in
the
most
reasonable
way
that
is
according
to
conclusions
scientifically
deduced
and
weighed
with
the
nicest
exactitude
and
yet
to
follow
the
most
selfish
unjust
and
even
iniquitons
maxims
so
that
never
before
kant
did
it
occur
to
any
one
to
identify
just
virtuous
and
noble
conduct
with
the
two
lines
of
behaviour
have
always
been
completely
separated
and
kept
apart
the
one
depends
on
the
of
the
other
on
the
difference
in
fundamental
principles
only
after
kant
because
he
taught
that
virtue
has
its
source
in
pure
reason
did
the
virtuous
and
the
reasonable
become
one
and
the
same
thing
despite
the
usage
of
these
words
which
all
languages
have
adopted
a
usage
which
is
not
fortuitous
but
the
work
of
universal
and
therefore
uniform
human
judgment
reasonable
and
vicious
are
terms
that
go
very
well
together
indeed
great
crimes
are
only
possible
from
their
union
similarly
unreasonable
and
are
often
found
associated
if
i
give
to
the
needy
man
what
i
shall
myself
require
more
urgently
than
he
or
if
i
am
so
far
affected
as
to
hand
over
to
one
in
distress
the
sum
which
my
creditor
is
waiting
for
and
such
cases
could
be
multiplied
indefinitely
we
have
seen
that
this
exaltation
of
reason
to
be
the
source
of
all
virtue
rests
on
two
assertions
first
as
it
is
said
to
issue
like
an
oracle
peremptory
imperatives
purely
secondly
taken
in
connection
with
the
false
explanation
of
as
given
in
the
der
reinen
it
is
presented
as
a
certain
faculty
essentially
concerned
with
the
as
manifested
in
three
alleged
ideas
the
impossibility
of
which
the
intellect
at
the
same
time
recognises
and
we
found
that
this
position
as
an
vitiis
led
our
philosophers
jacobi
at
their
head
from
bad
to
worse
they
talked
of
as
directly
comprehending
the
and
absurdly
declared
that
it
is
a
certain
mental
property
which
has
to
do
essentially
with
things
transcending
all
experience
with
metaphysics
and
that
it
perceives
directly
and
intuitively
the
ultimate
causes
of
all
things
and
of
all
being
the
supersensuous
the
absolute
the
divine
etc
now
had
it
been
wished
to
use
reason
instead
of
deifying
it
such
assertions
as
these
must
long
ago
have
been
met
by
the
simple
remark
that
if
man
by
virtue
of
a
special
organ
furnished
by
his
reason
for
solving
the
riddle
of
the
world
possessed
an
innate
metaphysics
that
only
required
development
in
that
case
there
would
have
to
be
just
as
complete
agreement
on
metaphysical
matters
as
on
the
truths
of
arithmetic
and
geometry
and
this
would
make
it
totally
impossible
that
there
should
exist
on
the
earth
a
large
number
of
radically
different
religions
and
a
still
larger
number
of
radically
different
systems
of
philosophy
indeed
we
may
rather
suppose
that
if
any
one
were
found
to
differ
from
the
rest
in
his
religious
or
philosophical
views
he
would
be
at
once
regarded
as
a
subject
for
mental
pathology
nor
would
the
following
plain
reflection
have
failed
to
present
itself
if
we
discovered
a
species
of
apes
which
intentionally
prepared
instruments
for
fighting
or
building
or
for
any
other
purpose
we
should
immediately
admit
that
it
was
endowed
with
reason
on
the
other
hand
if
we
meet
with
savages
destitute
of
all
metaphysics
or
of
all
religion
and
there
are
such
it
does
not
occur
to
us
to
deny
them
reason
on
that
account
the
reason
that
its
pretended
supersensuous
knowledge
was
duly
brought
back
to
bounds
by
kant
critique
but
wonderful
reason
that
directly
the
supersensuous
he
must
indeed
have
thought
all
criticism
meanwhile
a
certain
imperious
and
oracular
reason
of
the
same
kind
is
still
at
the
universities
fastened
on
the
shoulders
of
our
innocent
youth
note
if
we
wish
to
reach
the
real
origin
of
this
hypothesis
of
practical
reason
we
must
trace
its
descent
a
little
further
back
we
shall
find
that
it
is
derived
from
a
doctrine
which
kant
totally
confuted
but
which
nevertheless
in
this
connection
lies
secretly
indeed
he
himself
is
not
aware
of
it
at
the
root
of
his
assumption
of
a
practical
reason
with
its
imperatives
and
its
autonomy
a
reminiscence
of
a
former
mode
of
thought
i
mean
the
rational
psychology
according
to
which
man
is
composed
of
two
entirely
heterogeneous
substances
the
material
body
and
the
immaterial
soul
plato
was
the
first
to
formulate
this
dogma
and
he
endeavoured
to
prove
it
as
an
objective
truth
but
it
was
descartes
who
by
working
it
out
with
scientific
exactness
perfectly
developed
and
completed
it
and
this
is
just
what
brought
its
fallacy
to
light
as
demonstrated
by
spinoza
locke
and
kant
successively
it
was
demonstrated
by
spinoza
because
his
philosophy
consists
chiefly
in
the
refutation
of
his
master
twofold
dualism
and
because
he
entirely
and
expressly
denied
the
two
substances
of
descartes
and
took
as
his
main
principle
the
following
proposition
cogitans
et
substantia
externa
una
eademque
est
substantia
quae
jam
sub
hoc
jam
sub
illo
attribute
it
was
demonstrated
by
locke
for
he
combated
the
theory
of
innate
ideas
derived
all
knowledge
from
the
sensuous
and
taught
that
it
is
not
impossible
that
matter
should
think
and
lastly
it
was
demonstrated
by
kant
in
his
der
rationalen
as
given
in
the
first
edition
leibnitz
and
wolff
were
the
champions
on
the
bad
side
and
this
brought
leibnitz
the
undeserved
honour
of
being
compared
to
the
great
plato
who
was
really
so
unlike
him
but
to
enter
into
details
here
would
be
out
of
place
according
to
this
rational
psychology
the
soul
was
originally
and
in
its
essence
a
substance
and
only
as
a
consequence
thereof
did
it
become
possessed
of
volition
according
as
it
carried
on
these
two
modes
of
its
activity
perception
and
volition
conjoined
with
the
body
or
incorporeal
and
entirely
so
it
was
endowed
with
a
lower
or
higher
faculty
of
perception
and
of
volition
in
like
kind
in
its
higher
faculty
the
immaterial
soul
was
active
solely
by
itself
and
without
of
the
body
in
this
case
it
was
being
composed
of
concepts
belonging
exclusively
to
itself
and
of
the
corresponding
acts
of
will
both
of
which
were
absolutely
spiritual
and
had
nothing
sensuous
about
them
the
sensuous
being
derived
from
the
body
so
that
it
perceived
nothing
else
but
pure
abstracts
universals
innate
conceptions
etc
wherefore
also
its
volition
was
entirely
controlled
by
purely
spiritual
ideas
like
these
on
the
other
hand
the
soul
faculty
of
perception
and
volition
was
the
result
of
its
working
in
concert
and
close
union
with
the
various
organs
of
the
body
whereby
a
prejudicial
effect
was
produced
on
its
an
mixed
spiritual
activity
here
to
this
faculty
was
supposed
to
belong
every
perception
which
consequently
would
have
to
be
obscure
and
confused
while
the
formed
by
separating
from
objects
their
qualities
would
be
clear
the
will
which
was
determined
by
preceptions
thus
sensuously
conditioned
formed
the
lower
volition
and
it
was
for
the
most
part
bad
for
its
acts
were
guided
by
the
impulse
of
the
senses
while
the
other
will
the
higher
was
untrammelled
was
guided
by
pure
reason
and
appertained
only
to
the
immaterial
soul
this
doctrine
of
the
cartesians
has
been
best
expounded
by
de
la
forge
in
his
de

in

read

of
the
dim
reminiscence
of
such
views
there
finally
arose
doctrine
of
the
autonomy
of
the
will
which
as
the
of
pure
practical
reason
lays
down
the
law
for
all
rational
beings
as
such
and
recognises
nothing
but
motives
as
opposed
to
the
latter
determining
only
the
lower
faculty
of
desires
to
which
the
higher
is
hostile
for
the
rest
this
whole
theory
which
was
not
really
systematically
set
forth
till
the
time
of
descartes
is
nevertheless
to
be
found
as
far
back
as
aristotle
in
his
i
it
is
sufficiently
clearly
stated
while
plato
in
the
pp
and
edit
bipont
had
already
paved
the
way
with
no
uncertain
hints
after
being
elaborated
to
great
perfection
by
the
cartesian
doctrine
we
find
it
a
hundred
years
later
waxed
bold
and
strong
and
occupying
the
foremost
place
but
precisely
for
this
reason
forced
to
reveal
its
true
nature
an
excellent
of
the
view
which
then
prevailed
is
presented
in
muratori
forza
della
fantasia
chaps
and
in
this
work
the
imagination
is
regarded
as
a
parely
material
corporeal
organ
of
the
brain
the
lower
faculty
of
perception
its
function
being
to
intuitively
apprehend
the
external
world
on
the
data
of
the
senses
and
nought
remains
for
the
immaterial
soul
but
thinking
reflecting
and
determining
it
must
have
been
felt
how
obviously
this
position
involves
the
whole
subject
in
doubt
for
if
matter
is
capable
of
the
intuitive
apprehension
of
the
world
in
all
its
complexity
it
is
inconceivable
that
it
should
not
also
be
capable
of
abstracting
this
intuition
wherefrom
everything
else
would
follow
abstraction
is
of
course
nothing
else
than
an
elimination
of
the
qualities
attaching
to
things
which
are
not
necessary
for
general
purposes
in
other
words
the
individual
and
special
differences
for
instance
if
i
disregard
or
abstract
that
which
is
peculiar
to
the
sheep
ox
stag
camel
i
reach
the
conception
of
ruminants
by
this
operation
the
ideas
lose
their
intuitiveness
and
as
merely
abstract
notions
or
concepts
they
require
words
to
fix
them
in
the
consciousness
and
allow
of
their
being
adequately
handled
all
this
shows
that
kant
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
of
that
doctrine
when
he
propounded
his
practical
reason
with
its
imperatives
these
epigrams

chapter
on
the
leading
principle
of
the
kantian
ethics
after
having
tested
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
actual
basis
of
ethics
i
now
turn
to
that
which
rests
on
it
his
principle
of
the
latter
is
very
closely
connected
with
the
former
indeed
in
a
certain
sense
they
both
grew
up
together
we
have
seen
that
the
formula
expressing
the
principle
reads
as
follows
act
only
in
accordance
with
that
precept
which
you
can
also
wish
should
be
a
general
law
for
all
rational
beings
it
is
a
strange
proceeding
for
a
man
who
is
seeking
a
law
to
determine
what
he
should
do
and
what
he
should
leave
undone
to
be
instructed
first
to
search
for
one
fit
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
all
possible
rational
beings
but
we
will
pass
over
that
it
is
sufficient
only
to
notice
the
fact
that
in
the
above
guiding
rule
as
put
forth
by
kant
we
have
obviously
not
reached
the
moral
law
itself
but
only
a
or
indication
where
it
is
to
be
looked
for
the
money
so
to
say
is
not
yet
paid
down
but
we
hold
a
safe
draft
for
it
and
who
then
is
the
cashier
to
say
the
truth
at
once
a
paymaster
in
this
connection
surely
very
unexpected
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
as
i
shall
now
demonstrate
the
precept
it
is
said
which
can
were
the
guide
of
all
men
conduct
is
itself
the
real
moral
principle
that
which
can
is
the
hinge
on
which
the
given
direction
turns
but
what
can
i
truly
wish
and
what
not
clearly
in
order
to
determine
what
i
can
wish
in
the
matter
under
discussion
i
require
yet
another
criterion
for
without
such
i
could
never
find
the
key
to
the
instruction
which
comes
to
me
like
a
sealed
order
where
then
is
this
criterion
to
be
discovered
certainly
nowhere
else
but
in
my
egoism
which
is
the
nearest
ever
ready
original
and
living
standard
of
all
volition
and
which
has
at
any
rate
the
primi
before
every
moral
principle
the
direction
for
finding
the
real
moral
law
which
is
contained
in
the
kantian
rule
rests
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
tacit
assumption
that
i
can
only
wish
for
that
which
is
most
to
my
advantage
now
because
in
framing
a
precept
to
be
generally
followed
i
can
not
regard
myself
as
always
active
but
must
contemplate
my
playing
a
part
and
at
times
therefore
from
this
point
of
view
my
decides
for
justice
and
not
from
any
wish
to
these
virtues
but
because
it
desires
to
them
we
are
reminded
of
the
miser
who
after
listening
to
a
sermon
on
beneficence
exclaims
gründlich
ausgeführt
wie
schön
möcht
ich
betteln
gehn
how
well
thought
out
how
excellent
almost
i
like
to
beg
this
is
the
indispensable
key
to
the
direction
in
which
kant
leading
principle
of
ethics
is
embedded
nor
can
he
help
supplying
it
himself
only
he
refrains
from
doing
so
at
the
moment
of
propounding
his
precept
lest
we
should
feel
shocked
it
is
found
further
on
in
the
text
at
a
decent
distance
so
as
to
prevent
the
fact
at
once
leaping
to
light
that
here
after
all
in
spite
of
his
grand
edifice
is
sitting
on
the
judge
seat
scales
in
hand
moreover
it
does
not
occur
till
after
he
has
decided
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
passive
side
that
this
position
holds
good
for
the
active
as
well
thus
on
we
read
that
i
could
not
for
a
general
law
to
establish
lying
because
people
would
no
longer
believe
me
or
else
pay
me
back
in
the
again
on
the
universality
of
a
law
to
the
effect
that
every
one
could
promise
what
he
likes
without
any
intention
of
keeping
his
word
would
make
the
promise
itself
together
with
the
object
in
view
whatever
that
might
be
impossible
for
no
one
would
it
on
in
connection
with
the
maxim
of
we
find
the
following
a
will
which
should
determine
this
would
contradict
itself
for
cases
can
occur
in
which
a
man
needs
the
love
and
sympathy
of
others
and
in
which
he
by
virtue
of
such
a
natural
law
evolved
from
his
own
will
would
deprive
himself
of
all
hope
of
the
help
which
he
desires
similarly
in
the
der

part
vol
chap
if
every
one
were
to
regard
others
distress
with
total
indifference
and
you
were
to
belong
to
such
an
order
of
things
would
you
be
there
with
the
concurrence
of
your
will
temere
in
nosmet
legem
sancimus
one
could
reply
these
passages
sufficiently
show
in
what
sense
the
phrase
to
be
able
to
wish
in
kant
formula
is
to
be
understood
but
it
is
in
the
anfangsgründe
der
that
this
real
nature
of
his
ethical
principle
is
most
clearly
stated
in
we
read
for
every
one
wishes
to
be
helped
if
however
a
man
were
to
give
utterance
to
his
rule
of
unwillingness
to
help
others
all
people
would
be
justified
in
refusing
him
assistance
thus
this
rule
of
selfishness
contradicts
itself
be
he
says
be
here
then
it
is
declared
as
explicitly
as
anything
can
be
that
moral
obligation
rests
solely
and
entirely
on
presupposed
consequently
it
is
utterly
selfish
and
only
admits
of
being
interpreted
by
egoism
which
under
the
condition
of
knows
how
to
make
a
compromise
cleverly
enough
such
a
course
would
be
quite
in
place
if
it
were
a
question
of
laying
down
the
fundamentals
of
but
not
when
we
come
to
construct
those
of
ethics
in
the
the
following
sentence
occurs
the
principle
of
always
acting
in
accordance
with
that
precept
which
you
can
also
wish
were
universally
established
as
law
this
is
the
only
condition
under
which
a
man
will
can
never
be
in
antagonism
with
itself
from
what
has
been
said
above
it
will
be
apparent
that
the
true
meaning
of
the
word
antagonism
may
be
thus
explained
if
a
man
should
sanction
the
precept
of
injustice
and
he
would
subsequently
in
the
event
of
his
playing
a
part
recall
it
and
so
his
will
would
itself
from
this
analysis
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
kant
famous
leading
principle
is
not
as
he
maintains
with
tireless
repetition
a
but
in
reality
a
imperative
because
it
tacitly
presupposes
the
condition
that
the
law
to
be
established
for
what
i
do
inasmuch
as
i
make
it
universal
shall
also
be
a
law
for
what
is
done
to
me
and
because
i
under
this
condition
as
the
party
can
not
possibly
for
injustice
and
but
if
i
strike
out
this
proviso
and
trusting
perhaps
to
my
surpassing
strength
of
mind
and
body
think
of
myself
as
always
and
never
then
in
choosing
the
precept
which
is
to
be
universally
valid
if
there
exists
no
basis
for
ethics
other
than
kant
i
can
perfectly
well
wish
that
injustice
and
should
be
the
general
rule
and
consequently
order
the
world
upon
the
simple
plan
that
they
should
take
who
have
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
wordsworth
in
the
foregoing
chapter
we
showed
that
the
kantian
leading
principle
of
ethics
is
devoid
of
all
real
foundation
it
is
now
clear
that
to
this
singular
defect
must
be
added
notwithstanding
kant
express
assertion
to
the
contrary
its
concealed
hypothetical
nature
whereby
its
basis
turns
out
to
be
nothing
else
than
egoism
the
latter
being
the
secret
interpreter
of
the
direction
which
it
contains
furthermore
regarding
it
solely
as
a
formula
we
find
that
it
is
only
a
periphrasis
an
obscure
and
disguised
mode
of
expressing
the
rule
tibi
fieri
non
vis
alteri
ne
do
not
to
another
what
you
are
unwilling
should
be
done
to
yourself
if
that
is
by
omitting
the
and
we
remove
the
limitation
and
include
the
duties
taught
by
love
as
well
as
those
prescribed
by
law
for
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
the
only
precept
which
i
can
wish
should
regulate
the
conduct
of
all
men
speaking
of
course
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
possibly
i
may
play
where
my
is
touched
this
rule
tibi
fieri
is
however
in
its
turn
merely
a
circumlocution
for
or
if
it
be
preferred
a
premise
of
the
proposition
which
i
have
laid
down
as
the
simplest
and
purest
definition
of
the
conduct
required
by
the
common
consent
of
all
ethical
systems
namely
laede
immo
omnes
quantum
potes
do
harm
to
no
one
but
rather
help
all
people
as
far
as
lies
in
your
power
the
true
and
real
substance
of
morals
is
this
and
never
can
be
anything
else
but
on
what
is
it
based
what
is
it
that
lends
force
to
this
command
this
is
the
old
and
difficult
problem
with
which
man
is
still
confronted
for
on
the
other
side
we
hear
egoism
crying
with
a
loud
voice
juva
immo
omnes
si
forte
conducit
help
nobody
but
rather
injure
all
people
if
it
brings
you
any
advantage
nay
more
malice
gives
us
the
variant
omnes
quantum
potes
but
rather
injure
all
people
as
far
as
you
can
to
bring
into
the
lists
a
combatant
equal
or
rather
superior
to
egoism
and
malice
combined
this
is
the
task
of
all
ethics
rhodus

the
division
of
human
duty
into
two
classes
has
long
been
recognised
and
no
doubt
owes
its
origin
to
the
nature
of
morality
itself
we
have
the
duties
ordained
by
law
otherwise
called
the
perfect
obligatory
narrower
duties
and
those
prescribed
by
virtue
otherwise
called
imperfect
wider

preferably
the
duties
taught
by

we
find
kant
desiring
to
give
a
further
confirmation
to
the
moral
principle
which
he
propounded
by
undertaking
to
derive
this
classification
from
it
but
the
attempt
turns
out
to
be
so
forced
and
so
obviously
bad
that
it
only
testifies
in
the
strongest
way
against
the
soundness
of
his
position
for
according
to
him
the
duties
laid
down
by
statutes
rest
on
a
precept
the
contrary
of
which
taken
as
a
general
natural
law
is
declared
to
be
quite
without
contradiction
while
the
duties
inculcated
by
virtue
are
made
to
depend
on
a
maxim
the
opposite
of
which
can
he
says
be
conceived
as
a
general
natural
law
but
can
not
possibly
be
wished
for
i
beg
the
reader
to
reflect
that
the
rule
of
injustice
the
reign
of
might
instead
of
right
which
in
the
kantian
view
is
not
even
thinkable
as
a
natural

is
in
reality
and
in
point
of
fact
the
dominant
order
of

not
only
in
the

kingdom

among

has
been
made
among
civilised
peoples
to
obviate
its
injurious
effects
by
means
of
all
the
machinery
of

as
soon
as
this
wherever
or
of
whatever
kind
it

eluded
the

immediately
resumes
its
sway
indeed
between

never

customary
jargon
about
justice
is
well
known
to
be
nothing
but
diplomacy
official
style
the
real
arbiter
is
brute
force
on
the
other
hand
genuine
voluntary
acts
of
justice
do
occur
beyond
all
doubt
but
always
only
as
exceptions
to
the
rule
furthermore
wishing
to
give
instances
by
way
of
introducing
the
classification
kant
establishes
the
duties
prescribed
by
law
first
through
the
duty
towards
oneself
the
duty
of
not
ending
one
life
voluntarily
if
the
pain
outweigh
the
pleasure
accordingly
the
rule
of
suicide
is
held
to
be
not
even
as
a
general
natural
law
i
on
the
contrary
maintain
that
since
here
there
can
be
no
intervention
of
state
control
it
is
exactly
this
rule
which
is
proved
to
be
an
actually
existing
unchecked
natural
law
for
it
is
absolutely
certain
as
daily
experience
attests
that
men
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
turn
to
directly
the
gigantic
strength
of
the
innate
instinct
of
is
distinctly
overpowered
by
great
suffering
to
suppose
that
there
is
any
thought
whatever
that
can
have
a
deferring
effect
after
the
fear
of
death
which
is
so
strong
and
so
closely
bound
up
with
the
nature
of
every
living
thing
has
shown
itself
powerless
in
other
words
to
suppose
that
there
is
a
thought
still
mightier
than
this
fear
is
a
daring
assumption
all
the
more
so
when
we
see
that
it
is
one
which
is
so
difficult
to
discover
that
the
moralists
are
not
yet
able
to
determine
it
with
precision
in
any
case
it
is
certain
that
arguments
against
suicide
of
the
sort
put
forward
by
kant
in
this
connection
and
have
never
hitherto
restrained
any
one
tired
of
life
even
for
a
moment
thus
a
natural
law
which
incontestably
exists
and
is
operative
every
day
is
declared
by
kant
to
be
simply
without
contradiction
and
all
for
the
sake
of
making
his
moral
principle
the
basis
of
the
classification
of
duties
at
this
point
it
is
i
confess
not
without
satisfaction
that
i
look
forward
to
the
groundwork
which
i
shall
give
to
ethics
in
the
sequel
from
it
the
division
of
duty
into
what
is
prescribed
by
law
and
what
is
taught
by
love
or
better
into
justice
and
results
quite
naturally
though
a
principle
of
separation
which
arises
from
the
nature
of
the
subject
and
which
entirely
of
itself
draws
a
sharp
line
of
demarkation
so
that
the
foundation
of
morals
which
i
shall
present
has
in
fact
ready
to
hand
that
confirmation
to
which
kant
with
a
view
to
support
his
own
position
lays
a
completely
groundless
claim
how
rashly
do
we
sanction
an
unjust
law
which
will
come
home
to
ourselves

on
the
derived
forms
of
the
leading
principle
of
the
kantian
ethics
it
is
well
known
that
kant
put
the
leading
principle
of
his
ethics
into
another
quite
different
shape
in
which
it
is
expressed
directly
the
first
being
indirect
indeed
nothing
more
than
an
indication
as
to
how
the
principle
is
to
be
sought
for
beginning
at
he
prepares
the
way
for
his
second
formula
by
means
of
very
strange
ambiguous
not
to
say
distorted
definitions
of
the
conceptions
and
which
may
be
much
more
simply
and
correctly
denoted
thus
an
is
the
direct
motive
of
an
act
of
the
will
a
the
indirect
sigillum
simplicity
is
the
seal
of
truth
kant
however
slips
through
his
wonderful
enunciations
to
the
statement
indeed
every
rational
being
exists
an
end
in
on
this
i
must
remark
that
to
exist
as
an
end
in
is
an
unthinkable
expression
a
in
to
be
an
end
means
to
be
an
object
of
volition
every
end
can
only
exist
in
relation
to
a
will
whose
end
as
above
stated
whose
direct
motive
it
is
only
thus
can
the
idea
end
have
any
sense
which
is
lost
as
soon
as
such
connection
is
broken
but
this
relation
which
is
essential
to
the
thing
necessarily
excludes
every
in
itself
end
in
oneself
is
exactly
like
saying
friend
in
oneself
enemy
in
oneself
uncle
in
oneself
north
or
east
in
itself
above
or
below
in
itself
and
so
on
at
bottom
the
end
in
itself
is
in
the
same
case
as
the
absolute
ought
the
same
thought
the
theological
secretly
indeed
unconsciously
lies
at
the
root
of
each
as
its
condition
nor
is
the
absolute
worth
which
is
supposed
to
be
attached
to
this
alleged
though
unthinkable
end
in
itself
at
all
better
circumstanced
it
also
must
be
characterised
without
pity
as
a
in
every
worth
is
a
valuation
by
comparison
and
its
bearing
is
necessarily
twofold
first
it
is
since
it
exists
for
some
one
and
secondly
it
is
as
being
compared
with
something
else
and
estimated
accordingly
severed
from
these
two
conditions
the
conception
worth
loses
all
sense
and
meaning
and
so
obviously
that
further
demonstration
is
needless
but
more
just
as
the
phrases
end
in
itself
and
absolute
worth
outrage
logic
so
true
morality
is
outraged
by
the
statement
on
that
irrational
beings
that
is
animals
are
and
should
therefore
be
treated
simply
as
which
are
not
at
the
same
time
ends
in
harmony
with
this
it
is
expressly
declared
in
the
anfanggründe
der
tugendlehre
a
man
can
have
no
duties
towards
any
being
except
towards
his
and
then
we
read
to
treat
animals
cruelly
runs
counter
to
the
duty
of
man
because
it
deadens
the
feeling
of
sympathy
for
them
in
their
sufferings
and
thus
weakens
a
natural
tendency
which
is
very
serviceable
to
morality
in
relation
to
so
one
is
only
to
have
compassion
on
animals
for
the
sake
of
practice
and
they
are
as
it
were
the
pathological
phantom
on
which
to
train
one
sympathy
with
men
in
common
with
the
whole
of
asia
that
is
not
tainted
by
islâm
which
is
tantamount
to
judaism
i
regard
such
tenets
as
odious
and
revolting
here
once
again
we
see
withal
how
entirely
this
philosophical
morality
which
is
as
explained
above
only
a
theological
one
in
disguise
depends
in
reality
on
the
biblical
ethics
thus
because
christian
morals
leave
animals
out
of
consideration
of
which
more
later
on
therefore
in
philosophical
morals
they
are
of
course
at
once
outlawed
they
are
merely
things
simply
to
ends
of
any
sort
and
so
they
are
good
for
vivisection
for
and
they
may
be
whipped
to
death
as
they
struggle
along
with
heavy
quarry
carts
shame
on
such
a
morality
which
is
worthy
of
pariahs
chandalas
and
mlechchas
which
fails
to
recognise
the
eternal
reality
immanent
in
everything
that
has
life
and
shining
forth
with
inscrutable
significance
from
all
eyes
that
see
the
sun
this
is
a
morality
which
knows
and
values
only
the
precious
species
that
gave
it
birth
whose
characteristic
it
makes
the
condition
under
which
a
being
may
be
an
object
of
moral
regard
by
this
rough
path
then
indeed
fas
et
by
fair
means
and
by
foul
kant
reaches
the
second
form
in
which
he
expresses
the
fundamental
principle
of
his
ethics
act
in
such
a
way
that
you
at
all
times
treat
mankind
as
much
in
your
own
person
as
in
the
person
of
every
one
else
not
only
as
a
means
but
also
as
an
end
such
a
statement
is
a
very
artificial
and
roundabout
way
of
saying
do
not
consider
yourself
alone
but
others
also
this
in
turn
is
a
paraphrase
for
tibi
fieri
non
vis
alteri
ne
do
not
to
another
what
you
are
unwilling
should
be
done
to
yourself
and
the
latter
as
i
have
said
contains
nothing
but
the
premises
to
the
conclusion
which
is
the
true
and
final
goal
of
all
morals
and
of
all
moralising
laede
immo
omnes
quantum
potes
do
harm
to
no
one
but
rather
help
all
people
as
far
as
lies
in
your
power
like
all
beautiful
things
this
proposition
looks
best
unveiled
be
it
only
observed
that
the
alleged
duties
towards
oneself
are
dragged
into
this
second
kantian
edict
intentionally
and
not
without
difficulty
some
place
of
course
had
to
be
found
for
them
another
objection
that
could
be
raised
against
the
formula
is
that
the
malefactor
condemned
to
be
executed
is
treated
merely
as
an
instrument
and
not
as
an
end
and
this
with
perfectly
good
reason
for
he
is
the
indispensable
means
of
upholding
the
terror
of
the
law
by
its
fulfilment
and
of
thus
accomplishing
the
law
end
the
repression
of
crime
but
if
this
second
definition
helps
nothing
towards
laying
a
foundation
for
ethics
if
it
can
not
even
pass
muster
as
its
leading
principle
that
is
as
an
adequate
and
direct
summary
of
ethical
precepts
it
has
nevertheless
the
merit
of
containing
a
fine
of
moral
psychology
for
it
marks
by
an
exceedingly
characteristic
token
which
is
quite
worth
while
being
here
more
closely
considered
this
then
of
which
each
of
us
is
full
and
to
conceal
which
as
our
we
have
invented
is
perpetually
peering
through
every
veil
cast
over
it
and
may
especially
be
detected
in
the
fact
that
our
dealings
with
all
those
who
come
across
our
path
are
directed
by
the
one
object
of
trying
to
find
before
everything
else
and
as
if
by
instinct
a
possible
to
any
of
the
numerous
with
which
we
are
always
engrossed
when
we
make
a
new
acquaintance
our
first
thought
as
a
rule
is
whether
the
man
can
be
useful
to
us
in
some
way
if
he
can
do
for
our
benefit
then
as
soon
as
we
are
convinced
of
this
he
himself
generally
becomes
nothing
to
us
to
seek
in
all
other
people
a
possible
means
to
our
ends
in
other
words
to
make
them
our
instruments
is
almost
part
of
the
very
nature
of
human
eyes
and
whether
the
instrument
will
have
to
suffer
more
or
less
in
the
using
is
a
thought
which
comes
much
later
sometimes
not
at
all
that
we
assume
others
to
be
similarly
disposed
is
shown
in
many
ways
by
the
fact
that
when
we
ask
any
one
for
information
or
advice
we
lose
all
confidence
in
his
words
directly
we
discover
that
he
may
have
some
in
the
matter
however
small
or
remote
for
then
we
immediately
take
for
granted
that
he
will
make
us
a
means
to
his
ends
and
hence
give
his
advice
not
in
accordance
with
his
but
with
his
and
this
no
matter
how
exact
the
former
may
be
or
how
little
the
latter
seem
involved
since
we
know
only
too
well
that
a
cubic
inch
of
desire
weighs
much
more
than
a
cubic
yard
of
discernment
conversely
when
we
ask
in
such
cases
what
ought
i
to
do
as
a
rule
nothing
else
will
occur
to
our
counsellor
but
how
we
should
shape
our
action
to
suit
his
own
ends
and
to
this
effect
he
will
give
his
reply
immediately
and
as
it
were
mechanically
without
so
much
as
bestowing
a
thought
on
our
ends
because
it
is
his
will
that
directly
dictates
the
answer
or
ever
the
question
can
come
before
the
bar
of
his
real
judgment
hence
he
tries
to
mould
our
conduct
to
his
own
benefit
without
even
being
conscious
of
it
and
while
he
supposes
that
he
is
speaking
out
of
the
abundance
of
his
discernment
in
reality
he
is
nothing
but
the
of
his
own
desire
indeed
such
may
lead
him
so
far
as
to
utter
lies
without
being
aware
of
it
so
greatly
does
the
influence
of
the
will
preponderate
that
of
the
intelligence
consequently
it
is
not
the
testimony
of
our
own
consciousness
but
rather
for
the
most
part
that
of
our
interest
which
avails
to
determine
whether
our
language
be
in
accordance
with
what
we
discern
or
what
we
desire
to
take
another
case
let
us
suppose
that
a
man
pursued
by
enemies
and
in
danger
of
life
meets
a
pedlar
and
inquires
for
some
of
escape
it
may
happen
that
the
latter
will
answer
him
by
the
question
do
you
need
any
of
my
wares
it
is
not
of
course
meant
that
matters
are
always
like
this
on
the
contrary
many
a
man
is
found
to
show
a
direct
and
real
participation
in
another
weal
and
woe
or
in
kant
language
to
regard
him
as
an
end
and
not
as
a
means
how
far
it
seems
natural
or
the
reverse
to
each
one
to
treat
his
neighbour
for
once
in
the
way
as
an
end
instead
of
as
usual
a
means
this
is
the
criterion
of
the
great
ethical
difference
existing
between
character
and
character
and
that
on
which
the
mental
attitude
of
sympathy
rests
in
the
last
resort
will
be
the
true
basis
of
ethics
and
will
form
the
subject
of
the
third
part
of
this
essay
thus
in
his
second
formula
kant
distinguishes
egoism
and
its
opposite
by
a
very
characteristic
trait
and
this
point
of
merit
i
have
all
the
more
gladly
brought
out
into
strong
light
and
illustrated
because
in
other
respects
there
is
little
in
the
groundwork
of
his
ethics
that
i
can
admit
the
third
and
last
form
in
which
kant
put
forward
his
moral
principle
is
the
of
the
will
the
will
of
every
rational
being
is
universally
legislative
for
all
rational
beings
this
of
course
follows
from
the
first
form
as
a
consequence
of
the
third
however
we
are
asked
to
believe
see
that
the
specific
characteristic
of
the
categorical
imperative
lies
in
the
of
all
by
the
will
when
acting
from
a
sense
of
duty
all
previous
moral
principles
had
thus
he
says
broken
down
because
the
latter
invariably
attributed
to
human
actions
at
bottom
a
certain
interest
whether
originating
in
compulsion
or
in
pleasurable
attraction
an
interest
which
might
be
one
own
or
another
let
this
be
particularly
noticed
whereas
a
universally
legislative
will
must
prescribe
actions
which
are
based
on
any
at
all
but
solely
on
a
feeling
of
duty
i
beg
the
reader
to
think
what
this
really
means
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
less
than
volition
without
motive
in
other
words
effect
without
cause
interest
and
motive
are
interchangeable
ideas
what
is
interest
but
mea
that
which
is
of
importance
to
me
and
is
not
this
in
one
word
whatever
stirs
and
sets
in
motion
my
will
consequently
what
is
an
interest
other
than
the
working
of
a
motive
upon
the
will
therefore
where
a
motive
moves
the
will
there
the
latter
has
an
interest
but
where
the
will
is
affected
by
no
motive
there
in
truth
it
can
be
as
little
active
as
a
stone
is
able
to
leave
its
place
without
being
pushed
or
pulled
no
educated
person
will
require
any
demonstration
of
this
it
follows
that
every
action
inasmuch
as
it
necessarily
must
have
a
motive
necessarily
also
presupposes
an
interest
kaut
however
propounds
a
second
entirely
new
class
of
actions
which
are
performed
without
any
interest
without
motive
and
these
actions
are
all
deeds
of
justice
and
it
will
be
seen
that
this
monstrous
assumption
to
be
refuted
needed
only
to
be
reduced
to
its
real
meaning
which
was
concealed
through
the
word
interest
being
trifled
with
meanwhile
kant
celebrates
sqq
the
triumph
of
his
autonomy
of
the
will
by
setting
up
a
moral
utopia
called
the
kingdom
of
ends
which
is
peopled
with
nothing
but
these
one
and
all
are
always
willing
without
willing
any
actual
without
interest
the
only
thing
that
they
will
is
that
they
may
all
perpetually
will
in
accordance
with
one
maxim
autonomy
est
satiram
non
it
is
difficult
to
refrain
from
writing
a
satire
but
there
is
something
else
to
which
kant
is
led
by
his
autonomy
of
the
will
and
it
involves
more
serious
consequences
than
the
little
innocent
kingdom
of
ends
which
is
perfectly
harmless
and
may
be
left
in
peace
i
mean
the
conception
of
now
this
dignity
is
made
to
rest
solely
on
man
autonomy
and
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
law
which
he
ought
to
obey
is
his
own
work
his
relation
to
it
thus
being
the
same
as
that
of
the
subjects
of
a
constitutional
government
to
their
statutes
as
an
ornamental
finish
to
the
kantian
system
of
morals
such
a
theory
might
after
all
be
passed
over
only
this
expression
once
it
was
uttered
by
kant
became
the
shibboleth
of
all
perplexed
and
moralists
for
behind
that
imposing
formula
they
concealed
their
lack
not
to
say
of
a
real
ethical
basis
but
of
any
basis
at
all
which
was
possessed
of
an
intelligible
meaning
supposing
cleverly
enough
that
their
readers
would
be
so
pleased
to
see
themselves
invested
with
such
a
dignity
that
they
would
be
quite
satisfied
let
us
however
look
at
this
conception
a
little
more
carefully
and
submit
it
to
the
test
of
reality
kant
defines
as
an
unconditioned
incomparable
value
this
is
an
explanation
which
makes
such
an
effect
by
its
magnificent
sound
that
one
does
not
readily
summon
up
courage
to
examine
it
at
close
quarters
else
we
should
find
that
it
too
is
nothing
but
a
hollow
hyperbole
within
which
there
lurks
like
a
gnawing
worm
the
in
every
value
is
the
estimation
of
one
thing
compared
with
another
it
is
thus
a
conception
of
comparison
and
consequently
relative
and
this
relativity
is
precisely
that
which
forms
the
essence
of
the
idea
according
to
diogenes
laertius
book
chap
this
was
already
correctly
taught
by
the
stoics
he
says
δὲ
ἀξίαν
εἶναι
ἀμοιβὴν
δοκιμάστου
ἢν
ἂν
ὁ
ἔμπειρος
τῶν
πραγμάτων
τάξῃ
ὅμοιον
εἐπεῑν
ἀμείβεσθαι
πυροὺς
πρὸς
τὰς
σὺν
ἡμιονô
an
unconditioned
absolute
such
as
dignity
is
declared
by
kant
to
be
is
thus
like
so
much
else
in
philosophy
the
statement
in
words
of
a
thought
which
is
really
unthinkable
just
as
much
as
the
highest
number
or
the
greatest
space
eben
wo
begriffe
stellt
ein
wort
zu
rechter
zeit
sich
but
where
conceptions
fail
just
there
a
word
comes
in
to
fill
the
blank
so
it
was
with
this
expression
a
most
acceptable
phrase
was
brought
into
currency
thereon
every
system
of
morals
that
was
spun
out
through
all
classes
of
duty
and
all
forms
of
casuistry
found
a
broad
basis
from
which
serene
elevation
it
could
comfortably
go
on
preaching
at
the
end
of
his
exposition
kant
says
but
how
it
is
that
without
other
motives
that
may
have
their
derivation
elsewhere
can
by
itself
be
that
is
how
without
there
being
any
object
for
the
will
to
take
an
antecedent
interest
in
the
simple
principle
of
the
universal
validity
of
all
the
precepts
of
pure
reason
as
laws
can
of
itself
provide
a
motive
and
bring
about
an
interest
which
may
be
called
purely
moral
or
in
other
words
how
it
is
that
pure
reason
can
be
practical
to
explain
this
problem
all
human
reason
is
inadequate
and
all
trouble
and
work
spent
on
it
are
vain
now
it
should
be
remembered
that
if
any
one
asserts
the
existence
of
a
thing
which
can
not
even
be
conceived
as
possible
it
is
incumbent
ou
him
to
prove
that
it
is
an
actual
reality
whereas
the
categorical
imperative
of
practical
reason
is
expressly
not
put
forward
as
a
fact
of
consciousness
nor
otherwise
founded
on
experience
rather
are
we
frequently
cautioned
not
to
attempt
to
explain
it
by
having
recourse
to
empirical
anthropology
cf
vi
of
the
preface
and
pp
moreover
we
are
repeatedly
assured
that
no
instance
can
show
and
consequently
there
can
be
no
empirical
proof
that
an
imperative
of
this
sort
exists
everywhere
and
further
on
we
read
that
the
reality
of
the
categorical
imperative
is
not
a
fact
of
experience
now
if
we
put
all
this
together
we
can
hardly
avoid
the
suspicion
that
kant
is
jesting
at
his
readers
expense
but
although
this
practice
may
be
allowed
by
the
present
philosophical
public
of
germany
and
seem
good
in
their
eyes
yet
in
kant
time
it
was
not
so
much
in
vogue
and
besides
ethics
then
as
always
was
precisely
the
subject
that
least
of
all
could
lend
itself
to
jokes
hence
we
must
continue
to
hold
the
conviction
that
what
can
neither
be
conceived
as
possible
nor
proved
as
actual
is
destitute
of
all
credentials
to
attest
its
existence
and
if
by
a
strong
effort
of
the
imagination
we
try
to
picture
to
ourselves
a
man
possessed
as
it
were
by
a
in
the
form
of
an
that
speaks
only
in
categorical
imperatives
and
confronting
his
wishes
and
inclinations
claims
to
be
the
perpetual
controller
of
his
actions
in
this
figure
we
see
no
true
portrait
of
human
nature
or
of
our
inner
life
what
we
discern
is
an
artificial
substitute
for
theological
morals
to
which
it
stands
in
the
same
relation
as
a
wooden
leg
to
a
living
one
our
conclusion
therefore
is
that
the
kantian
ethics
like
all
anterior
systems
is
devoid
of
any
sure
foundation
as
i
showed
at
the
outset
in
my
examination
of
its
the
structure
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
an
inversion
of
theological
morals
cloaked
in
very
abstract
formulae
of
an
apparently
origin
that
this
disguise
was
most
artificial
and
unrecognisable
is
the
more
certain
from
the
fact
that
kant
in
all
good
faith
was
actually
himself
deceived
by
it
and
really
believed
that
he
could
establish
independently
of
all
theology
and
on
the
basis
of
pure
intelligence
those
conceptions
of
the
law
and
of
the
hests
of
duty
which
obviously
have
no
meaning
except
in
whereas
i
have
sufficiently
proved
that
with
him
they
are
destitute
of
all
real
foundation
and
float
loosely
in
mid
air
however
the
mask
at
length
falls
away
in
his
own
workshop
and
theological
ethics
stands
forth
unveiled
as
witness
his
doctrine
of
the
highest
good
the
postulates
of
practical
reason
and
lastly
his
moral
theology
but
this
revelation
freed
neither
kant
nor
the
public
from
their
illusion
as
to
the
real
state
of
things
on
the
contrary
both
he
and
they
rejoiced
to
see
all
those
precepts
which
hitherto
had
been
sanctioned
by
faith
now
ratified
and
established
by
ethics
although
only
and
for
practical
purposes
the
truth
is
that
they
in
all
sincerity
put
the
effect
for
the
cause
and
the
cause
for
the
effect
inasmuch
as
they
failed
to
perceive
that
at
the
root
of
this
system
of
morals
there
lay
as
absolutely
necessary
assumptions
however
tacit
and
concealed
all
the
alleged
consequences
that
had
been
drawn
from
it
at
the
end
of
this
severe
investigation
which
must
also
have
been
tiring
to
my
readers
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
by
way
of
diversion
to
make
a
jesting
indeed
frivolous
comparison
i
would
liken
kant
in
his
to
a
man
who
at
a
ball
has
been
flirting
the
whole
evening
with
a
masked
beauty
in
hopes
of
making
a
conquest
till
at
last
throwing
off
her
disguise
she
reveals
herself
as
his
wife
to
keep
the
play
of
words
in
verschrobene
we
may
perhaps
render
them
twisted
mistwisted
a
contradiction
in
that
which
is
added
a
term
applied
to
two
ideas
which
can
not
be
brought
into
a
thinkable
a
chaṇḍāla
or
ćaṇḍāla
means
one
who
is
born
of
a
brahman
woman
by
a
śūdra
husband
such
a
union
being
an
abomination
hence
it
is
a
term
applied
to
a
low
common
person
mlechcha
or
mleććha
means
a
foreigner
one
who
does
not
speak
sanskṛit
and
is
not
subject
to
hindu
institutions
the
transition
from
a
a
barbarian
to
a
bad
or
wicked
man
is
these
duties
have
been
discussed
in

it
appears
that
block
in
his

was
the
first
to
make
human
dignity
expressly
and
exclusively
the
of
ethics
which
he

built
up
entirely
on

and
a
chapter
vii
kant
doctrine
of
conscience
the
alleged
practical
reason
with
its
categorical
imperative
is
manifestly
very
closely
connected
with
conscience
although
essentially
different
from
it
in
two
respects
in
the
first
place
the
categorical
imperative
as
commanding
necessarily
speaks
the
act
whereas
conscience
does
not
till
afterwards
the
act
conscience
can
at
best
only
speak
that
is
by
means
of
reflection
which
holds
up
to
it
the
recollection
of
previous
cases
in
which
similar
acts
after
they
were
committed
received
its
disapproval
it
is
on
this
that
the
etymology
of
the
word
conscience
appears
to
me
to
rest
because
what
has
already
taken
place
is
certain
undoubtedly
through
external
inducement
and
kindled
emotion
or
by
reason
of
the
internal
discord
of
bad
humour
impure
base
thoughts
and
evil
desires
rise
up
in
all
people
even
in
the
best
but
for
these
a
man
is
not
morally
responsible
and
need
not
load
his
conscience
with
them
since
they
only
show
what
the
genus
not
what
the
individual
who
thinks
them
would
be
capable
of
doing
other
motives
if
not
simultaneously
yet
almost
immediately
come
into
his
consciousness
and
confronting
the
unworthy
inclinations
prevent
them
from
ever
being
crystallised
into
deeds
thus
causing
them
to
resemble
the
minority
of
an
acting
committee
by
deeds
alone
each
person
gains
an
empirical
knowledge
no
less
of
himself
than
of
others
just
as
it
is
deeds
alone
that
burden
the
conscience
for
unlike
thoughts
these
are
not
problematic
on
the
contrary
they
are
certain
they
are
unchangeable
and
are
not
only
thought
but
the
latin
and
the
greek
have
the
same
sense
conscience
is
thus
the
that
a
man
has
about
what
he
has
done
the
second
point
of
difference
between
the
alleged
categorical
imperative
and
conscience
is
that
the
latter
always
draws
its
material
from
experience
which
the
former
can
not
do
since
it
is
purely
nevertheless
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
doctrine
of
conscience
will
throw
some
light
on
this
new
conception
of
an
which
he
introduced
his
theory
is
most
completely
set
forth
in
the
anfangsgründe
zur
and
in
the
following
criticism
i
shall
assume
that
the
few
pages
which
contain
it
are
lying
before
the
reader
the
kantian
interpretation
of
conscience
makes
an
exceedingly
imposing
effect
before
which
one
used
to
stand
with
reverential
awe
and
all
the
less
confidence
was
felt
in
demurring
to
it
because
there
lay
heavy
on
the
mind
the
fear
of
having
theoretical
objections
construed
as
practical
and
if
the
correctness
of
view
were
denied
of
being
regarded
as
devoid
of
conscience
i
however
can
not
be
led
astray
in
this
manner
since
the
question
here
is
of
theory
not
of
practice
and
i
am
not
concerned
with
the
preaching
of
morals
but
with
the
exact
investigation
of
the
ultimate
ethical
basis
we
notice
at
once
that
kant
employs
exclusively
latin
legal
terminology
which
however
would
seem
little
adapted
to
reflect
the
most
secret
stirrings
of
the
human
heart
yet
this
language
this
judicial
way
of
treating
the
subject
he
retains
from
first
to
last
as
though
it
were
essential
and
proper
to
the
matter
and
so
we
find
brought
upon
the
stage
of
our
inner
self
a
complete
court
of
justice
with
indictment
judge
plaintiff
defendant
and
sentence
nothing
is
wanting
now
if
this
tribunal
as
portrayed
by
kant
really
existed
in
our
breasts
it
would
be
astonishing
if
a
single
person
could
be
found
to
be
i
do
not
say
but
as
to
act
against
his
conscience
for
such
a
supernatural
assize
of
an
entirely
special
kind
set
up
in
our
consciousness
such
a
secret
court
like
another
fehmgericht
held
in
the
dark
recesses
of
our
inmost
being
would
inspire
everybody
with
a
terror
and
fear
of
the
gods
strong
enough
to
really
keep
him
from
grasping
at
short
transient
advantages
in
face
of
the
dreadful
threats
of
superhuman
powers
speaking
in
tones
so
near
and
so
clear
in
real
life
on
the
contrary
we
find
that
the
efficiency
of
conscience
is
generally
considered
such
a
vanishing
quantity
that
all
peoples
have
bethought
themselves
of
helping
it
out
by
means
of
positive
religion
or
even
of
entirely
replacing
it
by
the
latter
moreover
if
conscience
were
indeed
of
this
peculiar
nature
the
royal
society
could
never
have
thought
of
the
question
put
for
the
present
prize
essay
but
if
we
look
more
closely
at
kant
exposition
we
shall
find
that
its
imposing
effect
is
mainly
produced
by
the
fact
that
he
attributes
to
the
moral
verdict
passed
on
ourselves
as
its
peculiar
and
essential
characteristic
a
form
which
in
fact
is
not
so
at
all
this
metaphorical
bar
of
judgment
is
no
more
applicable
to
moral
than
it
is
to
every
other
reflection
as
regards
what
we
have
done
and
might
have
done
otherwise
where
no
ethical
question
is
involved
for
it
is
not
only
true
that
the
same
procedure
of
indictment
defence
and
sentence
is
occasionally
assumed
by
that
obviously
spurious
and
artificial
conscience
which
is
based
on
mere
superstition
as
for
instance
when
a
hindu
reproaches
himself
with
having
been
the
murderer
of
a
cow
or
when
a
jew
remembers
that
he
has
smoked
his
pipe
at
home
on
the
sabbath
but
even
the
which
springs
from
no
ethical
source
being
indeed
rather
unmoral
than
moral
often
appears
in
a
shape
of
this
sort
as
the
following
case
may
exemplify
suppose
i
but
thoughtlessly
have
made
myself
surety
for
a
friend
and
suppose
there
comes
with
evening
the
clear
perception
of
the
heavy
responsibility
i
have
taken
on
myself
a
responsibility
that
may
easily
involve
me
in
serious
trouble
as
the
wise
old
saying
παρά
δ
predicts
then
at
once
there
rise
up
within
me
the
accuser
and
the
counsel
for
the
defence
ready
to
confront
each
other
the
latter
endeavours
to
palliate
my
rashness
in
giving
bail
so
hastily
by
pointing
out
the
stress
of
circumstance
or
of
obligation
or
it
may
be
the
simple
straightforwardness
of
the
transaction
perhaps
he
even
seeks
excuse
by
commending
my
kind
heart
last
of
all
comes
the
judge
who
inexorably
passes
the
sentence
a
fool
piece
of
work
and
i
am
overwhelmed
with
confusion
so
much
for
this
judicial
form
of
which
kant
is
so
fond
his
other
modes
of
expression
are
for
the
most
part
open
to
the
same
criticism
for
instance
that
which
he
attributes
to
conscience
at
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
as
its
peculiar
property
applies
equally
to
all
other
scruples
of
an
entirely
different
sort
he
says
it
conscience
follows
him
like
his
shadow
try
though
he
may
to
escape
by
pleasures
and
distractions
he
may
be
stupefied
and
billed
to
sleep
but
he
can
not
avoid
occasionally
waking
up
and
coming
to
himself
and
then
he
is
immediately
aware
of
the
terrible
voice
etc
obviously
this
may
be
just
as
well
understood
word
for
word
of
the
secret
consciousness
of
some
person
of
private
means
who
feels
that
his
expenses
far
exceed
his
income
and
that
thus
his
capital
is
being
affected
and
will
gradually
melt
away
we
have
seen
that
kant
represents
the
use
of
legal
terms
as
essential
to
the
subject
and
that
he
keeps
to
them
from
beginning
to
end
let
it
now
be
noted
how
he
employs
the
same
style
for
the
following
finely
devised
sophism
he
says
that
a
person
accused
by
his
conscience
should
be
identified
with
the
judge
is
an
absurd
way
of
portraying
a
court
of
justice
for
in
that
case
the
accuser
would
invariably
lose
and
he
adds
by
way
of
elucidating
this
statement
a
very
ambiguous
and
obscure
note
his
conclusion
is
that
if
we
would
avoid
falling
into
a
contradiction
we
must
think
of
the
judge
in
the
judicial
that
is
enacted
in
our
breasts
as
different
from
us
in
fact
as
another
person
nay
more
as
one
that
is
an
omniscient
knower
of
hearts
whose
hests
are
obligatory
on
all
and
who
is
almighty
for
every
purpose
of
executive
authority
he
thus
passes
by
a
perfectly
smooth
path
from
conscience
to
superstition
making
the
latter
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
former
while
he
is
secretly
sure
that
he
will
be
all
the
more
willingly
followed
because
the
earliest
training
will
have
certainly
rendered
him
familiar
with
such
ideas
if
not
have
made
them
his
second
nature
here
then
kant
finds
an
easy
task
a
thing
he
ought
rather
to
have
despised
for
he
should
have
concerned
himself
not
only
with
preaching
but
also
with
practising
truthfulness
i
entirely
reject
the
above
quoted
sentence
and
all
the
conclusions
consequent
thereon
and
i
declare
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
shuffling
trick
it
is
that
the
accuser
must
always
lose
when
the
accused
is
the
same
person
as
the
judge
at
least
not
in
the
court
of
judgment
in
our
hearts
in
the
instance
i
gave
of
one
man
going
surety
for
another
did
the
accuser
lose
or
must
we
in
this
case
also
if
we
wish
to
avoid
a
contradiction
really
assume
a
personification
after
kant
fashion
and
be
driven
to
view
objectively
as
that
voice
whose
deliverance
would
have
been
those
terrible
words
a
fool
piece
of
work
a
sort
of
mercury
forsooth
in
living
flesh
or
perhaps
a
prosopopoeia
of
the
cunning
recommended
by
homer
xxiii
but
thus
we
should
only
be
landed
as
before
on
the
broad
path
of
superstition
aye
and
pagan
superstition
too
it
is
in
this
passage
that
kant
indicates
his
moral
theology
briefly
indeed
yet
not
without
all
its
vital
points
the
fact
that
he
takes
care
not
to
attribute
to
it
any
objective
validity
but
rather
to
present
it
merely
as
a
form
subjectively
unavoidable
does
not
free
him
from
the
arbitrariness
with
which
he
constructs
it
even
though
he
only
claims
its
necessity
for
human
consciousness
his
fabric
rests
as
we
have
seen
on
a
tissue
of
baseless
assumptions
so
much
then
is
certain
the
entire
imagery
that
of
a
judicial
drama
whereby
kant
depicts
conscience
is
wholly
unessential
and
in
no
way
peculiar
to
it
although
he
keeps
this
figure
as
if
it
were
proper
to
the
subject
right
through
to
the
end
in
order
finally
to
deduce
certain
conclusions
from
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
sufficiently
common
form
which
our
thoughts
easily
take
when
we
consider
any
circumstance
of
real
life
it
is
due
for
the
most
part
to
the
conflict
of
opposing
motives
which
usually
spring
up
and
which
are
successively
weighed
and
tested
by
our
reflecting
reason
and
no
difference
is
made
whether
these
motives
are
moral
or
egoistic
in
their
nature
nor
whether
our
deliberations
are
concerned
with
some
action
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
now
if
we
strip
from
kant
exposition
its
dress
of
legal
metaphor
which
is
only
an
optional
dramatic
appendage
the
surrounding
nimbus
with
all
its
imposing
effect
immediately
disappears
as
well
and
there
remains
nothing
but
the
fact
that
sometimes
when
we
think
over
our
actions
we
are
seized
with
a
certain
which
is
marked
by
a
special
characteristic
it
is
with
our
conduct
that
we
are
discontented
not
with
its
result
and
this
feeling
does
not
as
in
every
other
case
in
which
we
regret
the
stupidity
of
our
behaviour
rest
on
egoistic
grounds
for
on
these
occasions
the
cause
of
our
dissatisfaction
is
precisely
because
we
have
been
too
egoistic
because
we
have
taken
too
much
thought
for
ourselves
and
not
enough
for
our
neighbour
or
perhaps
even
because
without
any
resulting
advantage
we
have
made
the
misery
of
others
an
object
in
itself
that
we
may
be
dissatisfied
with
ourselves
and
saddened
by
reason
of
sufferings
which
we
have
inflicted
not
undergone
is
a
plain
fact
and
impossible
to
be
denied
the
connection
of
this
with
the
only
ethical
basis
that
can
stand
an
adequate
test
we
shall
examine
further
on
but
kant
like
a
clever
special
pleader

by
magnifying
and
embellishing
the
original
to
make
all
that
he
possibly
could
of
it
in
order
to
prepare
a
very
broad
foundation

his
ethics

kant
doctrine
of
the
intelligible
and
empirical
character
theory
of
freedom
the
attack
i
have
made
in
the
cause
of
truth
on
kant
system
of
morals
does
not
like
those
of
my
predecessors
touch
the
surface
only
but
penetrates
to
its
deepest
roots
it
seems
therefore
only
just
that
before
i
leave
this
part
of
my
subject
i
should
bring
to
remembrance
the
brilliant
and
conspicuous
service
which
he
nevertheless
rendered
to
ethical
science
i
allude
to
his
doctrine
of
the
of
freedom
and
necessity
we
find
it
first
in
the
der
reinen
pp
of
the
first
and
pp
of
the
fifth
edition
but
it
is
still
more
clearly
expounded
in
the
der
praktischen
fourth
edition
pp
pp
the
strict
and
absolute
necessity
of
the
acts
of
will
determined
by
motives
as
they
arise
was
first
shown
by
hobbes
then
by
spinoza
and
hume
and
also
by
dietrich
von
holbach
in
his
de
la
and
lastly
by
priestley
it
was
most
completely
and
precisely
demonstrated
this
point
indeed
has
been
so
clearly
proved
and
placed
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
must
be
reckoned
among
the
number
of
perfectly
established
truths
and
only
crass
ignorance
could
continue
to
speak
of
a
freedom
of
a
arbitrium
a
free
and
indifferent
choice
in
the
individual
acts
of
men
nor
did
kant
owing
to
the
irrefutable
reasoning
of
his
predecessors
hesitate
to
consider
the
will
as
fast
bound
in
the
chains
of
necessity
the
matter
admitting
as
he
thought
of
no
further
dispute
or
doubt
this
is
proved
by
all
the
passages
in
which
he
speaks
of
freedom
only
from
the
standpoint
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
our
actions
are
attended
with
a
consciousness
of
independence
and
original
initiative
which
makes
us
recognise
them
as
our
own
work
and
every
one
with
ineradicable
certainty
feels
that
he
is
the
real
author
of
his
conduct
and
morally
for
it
but
since
responsibility
implies
the
possibility
of
having
acted
otherwise
which
possibility
means
freedom
in
some
sort
or
manner
therefore
in
the
consciousness
of
responsibility
is
indirectly
involved
also
the
consciousness
of
freedom
the
key
to
resolve
the
contradiction
that
thus
arises
out
of
the
nature
of
the
case
was
at
last
found
by
kant
through
the
distinction
he
drew
with
profound
acumen
between
phaenomena
and
the
thing
in
itself
ding
an
this
distinction
is
the
very
core
of
his
whole
philosophy
and
its
greatest
merit
the
individual
with
his
immutable
innate
character
strictly
determined
in
all
his
modes
of
expression
by
the
law
of
causality
which
as
acting
through
the
medium
of
the
intellect
is
here
called
by
the
name
of
motivation
the
individual
so
constituted
is
only
the
the
in
itself
which
underlies
this
phaenomenon
is
outside
of
time
and
space
consequently
free
from
all
succession
and
plurality
one
and
changeless
its
constitution
in
itself
is
the
which
is
equally
present
in
all
the
acts
of
the
individual
and
stamped
on
every
one
of
them
like
the
impress
of
a
signet
on
a
thousand
seals
the
empirical
character
of
the
phaenomenon
the
character
which
manifests
itself
in
time
and
in
succession
of
acts
is
thus
determined
by
the
intelligible
character
and
consequently
the
individual
as
phaenomenon
in
all
his
modes
of
expression
which
are
called
forth
by
motives
must
show
the
invariableness
of
a
natural
law
whence
it
results
that
all
his
actions
are
governed
by
strict
necessity
now
it
used
to
be
commonly
maintained
that
the
character
of
a
man
may
be
transformed
by
moral
admonitions
and
remonstrances
appealing
to
reason
but
when
the
distinction
between
the
intelligible
and
empirical
character
had
once
been
drawn
it
followed
that
the
unchangeableness
the
inflexible
rigidity
of
the
empirical
character
which
thinking
people
had
always
observed
was
explained
and
traced
to
a
rational
basis
and
consequently
accepted
as
an
established
fact
by
philosophy
thus
the
latter
was
so
far
harmonised
with
experience
and
ceased
to
stand
abashed
before
popular
wisdom
which
long
before
had
spoken
the
words
of
truth
in
the
spanish
proverb
que
entra
con
el
capillo
sale
con
la
that
which
comes
in
with
the
child
cap
goes
out
with
the
or
que
en

leche
se
mama
en
la
mortaja
se
what
is
imbibed
with
the
milk
is
poured
out
again
in
the
this
doctrine
of
the
of
freedom
and
necessity
i
regard
as
the
greatest
of
all
the
achievements
of
human
sagacity
with
the
transcendental
aesthetics
it
forms
the
two
great
diamonds
in
the
crown
of
kant
fame
which
will
never
pass
away
in
his
treatise
on
freedom
schelling
obviously
served
up
the
kantian
teaching
in
a
paraphrase
which
by
reason
of
its
lively
colouring
and
graphic
delineation
is
for
many
people
more
comprehensible
the
work
would
deserve
praise
if
its
author
had
had
the
honesty
to
say
that
he
is
drawing
on
kant
wisdom
not
on
his
own
as
it
is
a
certain
part
of
the
philosophic
public
still
credits
him
with
the
entire
performance
the
theory
itself
and
the
whole
question
regarding
the
nature
of
freedom
can
be
better
understood
if
we
view
them
in
connection
with
a
general
truth
which
i
think
is
most
concisely
expressed
by
a
formula
frequently
occurring
in
the
scholastic
writings
sequitur
in
other
words
everything
in
the
world
operates
in
accordance
with
what
it
is
in
accordance
with
its
inherent
nature
in
which
consequently
all
its
modes
of
expression
are
already
contained
potentially
while
actually
they
are
manifested
when
elicited
by
external
causes
so
that
external
causes
are
the
means
whereby
the
essential
constitution
of
the
thing
is
revealed
and
the
modes
of
expression
so
resulting
form
the
character
whereas
its
hidden
ultimate
basis
which
is
inaccessible
to
experience
is
the
character
that
is
the
real
nature
of
the
particular
thing
in
question
man
forms
no
exception
to
the
rest
of
nature
he
too
has
a
changeless
character
which
however
is
strictly
individual
and
different
in
each
case
this
character
is
of
course
as
far
as
we
can
grasp
it
and
therefore
only
while
the
character
is
whatever
may
be
the
real
nature
in
itself
of
the
person
his
actions
one
and
all
being
as
regards
their
external
constitution
determined
by
motives
can
never
be
shaped
otherwise
than
in
accordance
with
the
unchangeable
individual
character
as
a
man
is
so
he
his
bound
to
act
hence
for
a
given
person
in
every
single
case
there
is
absolutely
only
one
way
of
acting
possible
sequitur
freedom
belongs
only
to
the
intelligible
character
not
to
the
empirical
the
conduct
of
a
given
individual
is
necessarily
determined
externally
by
motives
internally
by
his
character
therefore
everything
that
he
does
necessarily
takes
place
but
in
his
in
what
he
is
we
find
freedom
he
have
something
different
and
guilt
or
merit
attaches
to
that
which
he
is
all
that
he
does
follows
from
what
he
is
as
a
mere
corollary
through
doctrine
we
are
freed
from
the
primary
error
of
connecting
necessity
with
what
one
is
and
freedom
with
what
one
does
we
become
aware
that
this
is
a
misplacement
of
terms
and
that
exactly
the
inverse
arrangement
is
the
true
one
hence
it
is
clear
that
the
moral
responsibility
of
a
man
while
it
first
of
all
and
obviously
of
course
touches
what
he
does
yet
at
bottom
touches
what
he
is
because
what
he
is
being
the
original
his
conduct
as
motives
arise
could
never
take
any
other
course
than
that
which
it
actually
does
take
but
however
strict
be
the
necessity
whereby
in
the
individual
acts
are
elicited
by
motives
it
yet
never
occurs
to
anybody
not
even
to
him
who
is
convinced
of
this
necessity
to
exonerate
himself
on
that
account
and
cast
the
blame
on
the
motives
for
he
knows
well
enough
that
objectively
considered
any
given
circumstance
and
its
causes
perfectly
admitted
quite
a
different
indeed
a
directly
opposite
course
of
action
nay
that
such
a
course
would
actually
have
taken
place
only
he
had
been
a
different
that
he
is
precisely
such
a
one
as
his
conduct
proclaims
him
to
be
and
no
other
this
it
is
for
which
he
feels
himself
responsible
in
his
what
he
is
lies
the
vulnerable
place
where
the
sting
of
conscience
penetrates
for
conscience
is
nothing
but
acquaintance
with
one
own
self
an
acquaintance
that
arises
out
of
one
actual
mode
of
conduct
and
which
becomes
ever
more
intimate
so
that
it
is
the
what
one
is
which
in
reality
is
accused
by
conscience
while
the
what
one
does
supplies
the
incriminating
evidence
since
we
are
only
conscious
of
through
the
sense
of
therefore
where
the
latter
lies
the
former
must
also
be
in
the
in
one
being
it
is
the
what
one
does
that
is
subject
to
necessity
but
we
can
only
get
to
know
ourselves
as
well
as
others
we
have
no
knowledge
of
our
character
certainly
our
natural
tendency
is
to
cherish
a
very
high
opinion
of
it
because
the
maxim
praesumitur
bonus
donec
probetur
every
one
is
presumed
to
be
good
until
the
contrary
is
proved
is
perhaps
even
more
true
of
the
inner
court
of
justice
than
of
the
world
tribunals
note
he
who
is
capable
of
recognising
the
essential
part
of
a
thought
though
clothed
in
a
dress
very
different
from
what
he
is
familiar
with
will
see
as
i
do
that
this
kantian
doctrine
of
the
intelligible
and
empirical
character
is
a
piece
of
insight
already
possessed
by
plato
the
difference
is
that
with
kant
it
is
sublimated
to
an
abstract
clearness
with
plato
it
is
treated
mythically
and
connected
with
metempsychosis
because
as
he
did
not
perceive
the
ideality
of
time
he
could
only
represent
it
under
a
temporal
form
the
identity
of
the
one
doctrine
with
the
other
becomes
exceedingly
plain
if
we
read
the
explanation
and
illustration
of
the
platonic
myth
which
porphyrius
has
given
with
such
clear
exactitude
that
its
agreement
with
the
abstract
language
of
kant
comes
out
unmistakably
in
the
second
book
of
his
eclogues
chap
stobaeus
has
preserved
for
us
that
part
of
one
of
porphyrius
lost
writings
which
specially
comments
on
the
myth
in
question
as
plato
gives
it
in
the
second
half
of
the
tenth
book
of
the
republic
the
whole
section
is
eminently
worth
reading
as
a
specimen
i
shall
quote
the
short
in
the
hope
of
inducing
any
one
who
cares
for
these
things
to
study
stobaeus
for
himself
it
will
then
immediately
become
apparent
that
this
platonic
myth
is
nothing
less
than
an
allegory
of
the
profound
truth
which
kant
stated
in
its
abstract
purity
as
the
doctrine
of
the
intelligible
and
empirical
character
and
consequently
that
the
latter
had
been
reached
in
its
essentials
by
plato
thousands
of
years
ago
indeed
this
view
seems
to
go
back
much
further
still
for
porphyrins
is
of
opinion
that
plato
took
it
from
the
egyptians
certainly
we
already
find
the
same
theory
in
the
brahmanical
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
and
it
is
from
this
indian
source
that
the
egyptian
priests
in
all
probability
derived
their
wisdom
is

it
is
the
ήρὸς
τοῡ
to
sum
up
what
plato
meant
seems
to
be
this
souls
he
said
have
free
power
before
passing
into
bodies
and
different
modes
of
being
to
choose
this
or
that
form
of
life
which
they
will
pass
through
in
a
certain
kind
of
existence
and
in
a
body
adapted
thereto
for
a
soul
may
choose
a
lion
equally
with
a
man
mode
of
being
but
this
free
power
of
choice
is
removed
simultaneously
with
entrance
into
one
or
other
of
such
forms
of
life
for
when
once
they
have
descended
into
bodies
and
instead
of
unfettered
souls
have
become
the
souls
of
living
things
then
they
take
that
measure
of
free
power
which
belongs
in
each
case
to
the
organism
of
the
living
thing
in
some
forms
this
power
is
very
intelligent
and
full
of
movement
as
in
man
in
some
it
has
but
little
energy
and
is
of
a
simple
nature
as
in
almost
all
other
creatures
moreover
this
free
power
depends
on
the
organism
in
such
a
way
that
while
its
capability
of
action
is
caused
by
itself
alone
its
impulses
are
determined
by
the
desires
which
have
their
origin
in
the
chapter
ix
fichte
ethics
as
a
magnifying
glass
for
the
errors
of
the
kantian
just
as
in
anatomy
and
zoology
many
things
are
not
so
obvious
to
the
pupil
in
preparations
and
natural
products
as
in
engravings
where
there
is
some
exaggeration
so
if
there
is
any
one
who
after
the
above
criticism
is
still
not
entirely
satisfied
as
to
the
worthlessness
of
the
kantian
foundation
of
ethics
i
would
recommend
him
der
as
a
sure
means
of
freeing
him
from
all
doubt
in
the
old
german
marionnettes
a
fool
always
accompanied
the
emperor
or
hero
so
that
he
might
afterwards
give
in
his
own
way
a
highly
coloured
version
of
what
had
been
said
or
done
in
like
manner
behind
the
great
kant
there
stands
the
author
of
the
a
true
in
order
to
secure
his
own
and
his
family
welfare
fichte
formed
the
idea
of
creating
a
sensation
by
means
of
subtle
mystification
it
was
a
very
suitable
and
reasonable
plan
considering
the
nature
of
the
german
philosophic
public
and
he
executed
it
admirably
by
outdoing
kant
in
every
particular
he
appeared
as
the
latter
living
superlative
and
produced
a
perfect
caricature
of
his
philosophy
by
magnifying
all
its
salient
points
nor
did
the
ethics
escape
similar
treatment
in
his
der
we
find
the
categorical
imperative
grown
into
a
despotic
imperative
while
the
absolute
ought
the
reason
and
the
hest
of
duty
have
developed
into
a
an
unfathomable
necessity
requiring
mankind
to
act
strictly
in
accordance
with
certain
maxims
to
judge
pp
from
the
pompous
show
made
a
great
deal
must
depend
on
these
formulae
although
one
never
quite
discovers
what
so
much
only
seems
clear
as
in
bees
there
is
implanted
an
instinct
to
build
cells
and
a
hive
for
life
in
common
so
men
it
is
alleged
are
endowed
with
an
impulse
leading
them
to
play
in
common
a
great
strictly
moral
comedy
their
part
being
merely
to
figure
as
puppets
nothing
else
but
there
is
this
important
difference
between
the
bees
and
men
the
hive
is
really
brought
to
completion
while
instead
of
a
moral
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
exceedingly
immoral
one
is
enacted
here
then
we
see
the
imperative
form
of
the
kantian
ethics
the
moral
law
and
the
absolute
ought
pushed
further
and
further
till
a
system
of
ethical
is
evolved
which
as
it
is
worked
out
lapses
at
times
into
the
comic
if
in
kant
doctrine
we
trace
a
certain
moral
pedantry
with
fichte
this
pedantry
reaches
the
absurd
and
furnishes
abundant
material
for
satire
let
the
reader
notice
for
example
pp
how
he
decides
the
instance
of
casuistry
where
of
two
human
lives
one
must
be
lost
we
find
indeed
all
the
errors
of
kant
raised
to
the
superlative
thus
on
we
read
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
sympathy
of
compassion
and
of
is
distinctly
unmoral
indeed
this
line
of
conduct
as
such
is
contrary
to
morality
again
on
the
impulse
that
makes
us
ready
to
serve
others
must
never
be
an
inconsiderate
but
a
clearly
purpose
that
namely
of
furthering
as
much
as
possible
the
causality
of
reason
however
between
these
sallies
of
ridiculous
pedantry
fichte
real
philosophic
crudeness
peeps
out
clearly
enough
as
we
might
only
expect
in
the
case
of
a
man
whose
teaching
left
no
time
for
learning
he
seriously
puts
forward
the
arbitrium
a
free
and
indifferent
choice
giving
as
its
foundation
the
most
trivial
and
frivolous
reasons
pp
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
motive
although
working
through
the
medium
of
the
intelligence
is
nevertheless
a
cause
and
consequently
involves
the
same
necessity
of
effect
as
all
other
causes
the
corollary
being
that
all
human
action
is
a
strictly
necessary
result
whoever
remains
unconvinced
of
this
is
still
philosophically
speaking
barbarous
and
ignorant
of
the
rudiments
of
exact
knowledge
the
perception
of
the
strict
necessity
governing
man
conduct
forms
the
line
of
demarcation
which
separates
philosophic
heads
from
all
others
arrived
at
this
limit
fichte
clearly
showed
that
he
belonged
to
the
others
moreover
following
the
footsteps
of
kant
he
proceeds
to
make
various
statements
which
are
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
above
mentioned
passages
but
this
inconsistency
like
many
more
in
his
writings
only
proves
that
he
being
one
who
was
never
serious
in
the
search
for
truth
possessed
no
strong
convictions
to
build
on
as
indeed
for
his
purpose
they
were
not
in
the
least
necessary
nothing
is
more
laughable
than
the
fact
that
this
man
has
received
so
much
posthumous
praise
for
strictly
consequential
reasoning
his
pedantic
style
full
of
loud
declamation
about
trifling
matters
being
actually
mistaken
for
such
the
most
complete
development
of
fichte
system
of
is
found
in
his
last
work
wissenschaftslehre
in
ihrem
allgemeinen
umrisse
berlin
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
only
pages
duodecimo
long
while
it
contains
his
whole
philosophy
in
a
nutshell
it
is
therefore
to
be
recommended
to
all
those
who
consider
their
time
too
precious
to
be
wasted
on
his
larger
productions
which
are
framed
with
a
length
and
tediousness
worthy
of
christian
wolff
and
with
the
intention
in
reality
of
deluding
not
of
instructing
the
reader
in
this
little
treatise
we
read
on
the
intuitive
perception
of
a
phaenomenal
world
only
came
about
to
the
end
that
in
such
a
world
the
ego
as
the
might
be
visible
to
itself
on
we
actually
find
the
the
moral
necessity
of
the
visibility
and
on
an
a
moral
necessity
of
the
perception
that
i
this
then
is
what
we
have
come
to
so
soon
after
kant
imperative
with
its
unproved
which
it
secured
as
a
most
convenient
standpoint
is
indeed
an
vitiis
for
the
rest
all
that
i
have
said
does
not
overthrow
the
service
fichte
rendered
kant
philosophy
this
late
masterpiece
of
human
sagacity
in
the
very
land
where
it
arose
he
obscured
nay
supplanted
by
empty
bombastic
superlatives
by
extravagances
and
by
the
nonsense
which
is
found
in
his
der
gesammten
wissenschaftslehre
appearing
under
the
disguise
of
profound
penetration
his
merit
was
thus
to
show
the
world
unmistakably
what
the
capacity
of
the
german
philosophical
public
is
for
he
made
it
play
the
part
of
a
child
who
is
coaxed
into
giving
up
a
precious
gem
in
exchange
for
a
nürnberg
toy
the
fame
he
obtained
in
this
fashion
still
lives
on
credit
and
still
fichte
is
always
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
kant
as
being
another
such
καὶ
πίθηêκος
indeed
his
name
is
often
placed
above
the
latter
it
was
of
course
fichte
example
that
encouraged
his
successors
in
the
art
of
enveloping
the
german
people
in
philosophic
fog
these
were
animated
by
the
same
spirit
and
crowned
with
the
same
prosperity
every
one
knows
their
names
nor
is
this
the
place
to
consider
them
at
length
needless
to
say
their
different
opinions
down
to
the
minutest
details
are
still
set
forth
and
seriously
discussed
by
the
professors
of
philosophy
as
if
one
had
really
to
do
with
philosophers
we
must
then
thank
fichte
for
lucid
documents
now
existing
which
will
have
to
be
revised
one
day
before
the
tribunal
of
posterity
that
court
of
appeal
from
the
verdicts
of
the
present
which
like
the
last
judgment
looked
forward
to
by
the
saints
at
almost
all
periods

been
left

give

true

its
just
award

blank

we
might
translate

and
scientific
misinstruction
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
my
words
space
prevents
me
from
quoting
more
than
a
few
passages
the
moral
instinct
is
absolute
and
its
requirements
are
peremptory
without
any
object
outside
itself
in
consequence
of
the
moral
law
the
empirical
being
in
time
must
be
an
exact
copy
of
the
original
ego
the
whole
man
is
a
vehicle
of
the
moral
law
i
am
only
an
instrument
a
mere
tool
of
the
moral
law
not
in
any
sense
an
end
the
end
laid
before
every
one
is
to
be
the
means
of
realising
reason
this
is
the
ultimate
purpose
of
his
existence
for
this
alone
he
has
his
being
and
if
this
end
should
not
be
attained
there
is
not
the
least
occasion
for
him
to
live
i
am
an
instrument
of
the
moral
law
in
the
phaenomenal
world
it
is
an
ordinance
of
the
moral
law
to
nourish
one
body
and
study
one
health
this
of
course
should
be
done
in
no
way
and
for
no
other
purpose
except
to
provide
an
for
furthering
the
end

by

its
realisation
cf
p
every
human
body
is
an
instrument
for
furthering
the
end
decreed
by
reason
its
realisation
therefore
the
greatest
possible
fitness
of
each
instrument
must
constitute
for
me
an
end
consequently
i
must
take
thought
for
every
one
this
is
fichte
derivation
of
i
can
and
dare
take

for
myself
solely
because

i
conditions
of
the
problem
thus
the
foundation
which
kant
gave
to
ethics
which
for
the
last
sixty
years
has
been
regarded
as
a
sure
basis
proves
to
be
an
inadmissible
assumption
and
merely
theological
morals
in
disguise
it
sinks
therefore
before
our
eyes
into
the
deep
gulf
of
philosophic
error
which
perhaps
will
never
be
filled
up
that
the
previous
attempts
to
lay
a
foundation
are
still
less
satisfactory
i
take
for
granted
as
i
have
already
said
they
consist
for
the
most
part
of
unproved
assertions
drawn
from
the
impalpable
world
of
dreams
and
at
the
same
time
like
kant
system
itself
full
of
an
artificial
subtlety
dealing
with
the
finest
distinctions
and
resting
on
the
most
abstract
conceptions
we
find
difficult
combinations
rules
invented
for
the
purpose
formulae
balanced
on
a
needle
point
and
stilted
maxims
from
which
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
look
down
and
see
life
as
it
really
is
with
all
its
turmoil
such
niceties
are
doubtless
admirably
adapted
for
the
if
only
with
a
view
to
sharpening
the
wits
but
they
can
never
be
the
cause
of
the
impulse
to
act
justly
and
to
do
good
which
is
found
in
every
man
as
also
they
are
powerless
to
counterbalance
the
tendency
to
injustice
and
hardness
of
heart
neither
is
it
possible
to
fasten
the
reproaches
of
conscience
upon
them
to
attribute
the
former
to
the
breaking
of
such
precepts
only
serves
to
make
the
same
ridiculous
in
a
word
artificial
associations
of
ideas
like
these
can
not
possibly
if
we
take
the
matter
seriously
contain
the
true
incentive
to
justice
and
rather
must
this
be
something
that
requires
but
little
reflection
and
still
less
abstraction
and
complicated
synthesis
something
that
independent
of
the
training
of
the
understanding
speaks
to
every
one
even
to
the
rudest
a
something
resting
simply
on
intuitive
perception
and
forcing
its
way
home
as
a
direct
emanation
from
the
reality
of
things
so
long
as
ethics
can
not
point
to
a
foundation
of
this
sort
she
may
go
on
with
her
discussions
and
make
a
great
display
in
the
but
real
life
will
only
pour
contempt
upon
her
i
must
therefore
give
our
moralists
the
paradoxical
advice
first
to
look
about
them
a
little
among
their
chapter
ii
sceptical
view
but
when
we
cast
a
retrospect
over
the
attempts
made
and
made
in
vain
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
to
find
a
sure
basis
for
ethics
ought
we
not
perhaps
to
think
that
after
all
there
is
no
natural
morality
independent
of
human
institution
shall
we
not
conclude
that
all
moral
systems
are
nothing
but
artificial
products
means
invented
for
the
better
restraint
of
the
selfish
and
wicked
race
of
men
and
further
that
as
they
have
no
internal
credentials
and
no
natural
basis
they
would
fail
in
their
purpose
if
without
the
support
of
positive
religion
the
legal
code
and
the
police
are
not
sufficient
in
all
cases
there
are
offences
the
discovery
of
which
is
too
difficult
some
indeed
where
punishment
is
a
precarious
matter
where
in
short
we
are
left
without
public
protection
moreover
the
civil
law
can
at
most
enforce
justice
not
and
beneficence
because
of
course
these
are
qualities
as
regards
which
every
one
would
like
to
play
the
passive
and
no
one
the
active
part
all
this
has
given
rise
to
the
hypothesis
that
morality
rests
solely
on
religion
and
that
both
have
the
same
aim
that
of
being
complementary
to
the
necessary
inadequacy
of
state
machinery
and
legislation
consequently
there
can
not
be
it
is
said
a
natural
morality
one
based
simply
on
the
nature
of
things
or
of
man
and
the
fruitless
search
of
philosophers
for
its
foundation
is
explained
this
view
is
not
without
plausibility
and
we
find
it
as
far
back
as
the
pyrrhonians

also
in
modern
times
distinguished
thinkers
have
given
their
adherence
to
it
a
careful
examination
therefore
it
deserves
although
the
easier
course
would
be
to
shelve
it
by
giving
an
inquisitorial
glance
at
the
consciences
of
those
in
whom
such
a
theory
could
arise
we
should
fall
into
a
great
a
very
childish
blunder
if
we
believed
all
the
just
and
legal
actions
of
mankind
to
have
a
moral
origin
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
as
a
rule
between
the
justice
which
men
practise
and
genuine
singleness
of
heart
there
exists
a
relation
analogous
to
that
between
polite
expressions
and
the
true
love
of
one
neighbour
which
unlike
the
former
does
not
ostensibly
overcome
egoism
but
really
does
so
that
honesty
of
sentiment
everywhere
so
carefully
exhibited
which
requires
to
be
regarded
as
above
all
suspicion
that
deep
indignation
which
is
stirred
by
the
smallest
sign
of
a
doubt
in
this
direction
and
is
ready
to
break
out
into
furions
anger
to
what
are
we
to
attribute
these
symptoms
none
but
the
inexperienced
and
simple
will
take
them
for
pure
coin
for
the
working
of
a
fine
moral
feeling
or
conscience
in
point
of
fact
the
general
correctness
of
conduct
which
is
adopted
in
human
intercourse
and
insisted
on
as
a
rule
no
less
immovable
than
the
hills
depends
principally
on
two
external
necessities
first
on
legal
ordinance
by
virtue
of
which
the
rights
of
every
man
are
protected
by
public
authority
and
secondly
on
the
recognised
need
of
possessing
civil
honour
in
other
words
a
good
name
in
order
to
advance
in
the
world
this
is
why
the
steps
taken
by
the
individual
are
closely
watched
by
public
opinion
which
is
so
inexorably
severe
that
it
never
forgives
even
a
single
false
move
or
slip
but
remembers
it
against
the
guilty
person
as
an
indelible
blot
all
his
life
long
as
far
as
this
goes
public
opinion
is
wise
enough
for
starting
from
the
fundamental
principle
sequitur
what
one
does
is
determined
by
what
one
is
it
shows
its
conviction
that
the
character
is
unchangeable
and
that
therefore
what
a
man
has
once
done
he
will
assuredly
do
again
if
only
the
circumstances
be
precisely
similar
such
are
the
two
custodians
that
keep
guard
on
the
correct
conduct
of
people
without
which
to
speak
frankly
we
should
be
in
a
sad
case
especially
with
reference
to
property
this
central
point
in
human
life
around
which
the
chief
part
of
its
energy
and
activity
revolves
for
the
purely
ethical
motives
to
integrity
assuming
that
they
exist
can
not
as
a
rule
be
applied
except
very
indirectly
to
the
question
of
ownership
as
guaranteed
by
the
state
these
motives
in
fact
have
a
direct
and
essential
bearing
only
on
right
with
right
their
connection
is
merely
indirect
in
so
far
as
the
latter
is
based
on
the
former
natural
right
however
attaches
to
no
other
property
than
that
which
has
been
gained
by
one
own
exertion
because
when
this
is
seized
the
owner
is
at
the
same
time
robbed
of
all
the
efforts
he
expended
in
acquiring
it
the
theory
of
preoccupancy
i
reject
absolutely
but
can
not
here
set
forth
its
refutation
now
of
course
all
estate
based
on
positive
right
ought
ultimately
and
in
the
last
instance
it
matters
not
how
many
intermediate
links
are
involved
to
rest
on
the
natural
right
of
possession
but
what
a
distance
there
is
in
most
cases
between
the
that
belong
to
our
civil
life
and
this
natural
right
their
original
source
indeed
their
connection
with
the
latter
is
generally
either
very
difficult
or
else
impossible
to
prove
what
we
hold
is
ours
by
inheritance
by
marriage
by
success
in
the
lottery
or
if
in
no
way
of
this
kind
still
it
is
not
gained
by
our
own
work
with
the
sweat
of
the
brow
but
rather
by
shrewdness
and
bright
ideas
in
the
field
of
speculation
yes
and
sometimes
even
by
our
very
stupidity
which
through
a
conjunction
of
circumstances
is
crowned
and
glorified
by
the
it
is
only
in
a
very
small
minority
of
cases
that
property
is
the
fruit
of
real
labour
and
toil
and
even
then
the
work
is
usually
mental
like
that
of
lawyers
doctors
civilians
teachers
etc
and
this
in
the
eyes
of
the
rude
appears
to
cost
but
little
effort
now
when
wealth
is
acquired
in
any
such
fashion
there
is
need
of
considerable
education
before
the
ethical
right
can
be
recognised
and
respected
out
of
a
purely
moral
impulse
hence
it
comes
about
that
not
a
few
secretly
regard
the
possessions
of
others
as
held
merely
by
virtue
of
positive
right
so
if
they
find
means
to
wrest
from
another
man
his
goods
by
using
or
perhaps
by
evading
the
laws
they
feel
no
scruples
for
in
their
opinion
he
would
lose
what
he
holds
in
the
same
way
in
which
he
had
previously
obtained
it
and
they
consequently
regard
their
own
claims
as
equal
to
his
from
their
point
of
view
the
right
of
the
stronger
in
civil
society
is
superseded
by
the
right
of
the
cleverer
incidentally
we
may
notice
that
the
man
often
shows
an
inflexible
correctness
of
conduct
why
because
with
his
whole
heart
he
is
attached
to
and
rigidly
maintains
a
rule
on
the
observance
of
which
his
entire
wealth
and
all
its
attendant
advantages
depend
for
this
reason
his
profession
of
the
principle
to
each
his
own
is
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
shows
an
unswerving
consistency
no
doubt
there
is
an
loyalty
to
sincerity
and
good
faith
which
avails
to
keep
them
sacred
but
such
loyalty
is
based
simply
on
the
fact
that
sincerity
and
good
faith
are
the
foundation
of
all
free
intercourse
among
men
of
good
order
and
of
secure
ownership
consequently
they
very
often
benefit
and
with
this
end
in
view
they
must
be
preserved
even
at
some
cost
just
as
a
good
piece
of
land
is
worth
a
certain
outlay
but
integrity
thus
derived
is
as
a
rule
only
to
be
met
with
among
wealthy
people
or
at
least
those
who
are
engaged
in
a
lucrative
business
it
is
an
especial
characteristic
of
tradesmen
because
they
have
the
strongest
conviction
that
for
all
the
operations
of
commerce
the
one
thing
indispensable
is
mutual
trust
and
credit
and
this
is
why
mercantile
honour
stands
quite
by
itself
on
the
other
hand
the
man
who
can
not
make
both
ends
meet
and
who
by
reason
of
the
unequal
division
of
property
sees
himself
condemned
to
want
and
hard
work
while
others
before
his
eyes
are
lapped
in
luxury
and
idleness
will
not
easily
perceive
that
the
of
this
inequality
is
a
corresponding
inequality
of
service
and
honest
industry
and
if
he
does
recognise
this
how
is
he
to
be
governed
by
the
purely
ethical
motive
to
uprightness
which
should
keep
him
from
stretching
out
his
hand
to
grasp
the
superfluity
of
another
generally
it
is
the
order
of
government
as
established
by
law
that
restrains
him
but
should
ever
the
rare
occasion
present
itself
when
he
discovers
that
he
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
police
and
that
he
could
by
a
single
act
throw
off
the
galling
burden
of
penury
which
is
aggravated
by
the
sight
of
others
opulence
if
he
feels
this
and
realises
that
he
could
thus
enter
into
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
all
that
he
has
so
often
coveted
what
is
there
then
to
stay
his
hand
religions
dogmas
it
is
seldom
that
faith
is
so
firm
a
purely
moral
incentive
to
be
just
and
upright
perhaps
in
a
few
isolated
cases
but
in
by
far
the
greater
number
there
is
in
reality
nothing
but
the
anxiety
a
man
feels
to
keep
his
good
name
his
civil
honour
a
thing
that
touches
closely
even
those
in
humble
circumstances
he
knows
the
imminent
danger
incurred
of
having
to
pay
for
dishonest
conduct
by
being
expelled
from
the
great
masonic
lodge
of
honourable
people
who
live
correct
lives
he
knows
that
property
all
over
the
world
is
in
their
hands
and
duly
apportioned
among
themselves
and
that
they
wield
the
power
of
making
him
an
outcast
for
life
from
good
society
in
case
he
commit
a
single
disgraceful
action
he
knows
that
whoever
takes
one
false
step
in
this
direction
is
marked
as
a
person
that
no
one
trusts
whose
company
every
one
shuns
and
from
whom
all
advancement
is
cut
off
to
whom
as
being
a
fellow
that
has
stolen
the
proverb
is
applied
he
who
steals
once
is
a
thief
all
his
life
these
then
are
the
guards
that
watch
over
correct
behaviour
between
man
and
man
and
he
who
has
lived
and
kept
his
eyes
open
will
admit
that
the
vast
majority
of
honourable
actions
in
human
intercourse
must
be
attributed
to
them
nay
he
will
go
further
and
say
that
there
are
not
wanting
people
who
hope
to
elude
even
their
vigilance
and
who
regard
justice
and
honesty
merely
as
an
external
badge
as
a
flag
under
the
protection
of
which
they
can
carry
out
their
own
freebooting
propensities
with
better
success
we
need
not
therefore
break
out
into
holy
wrath
and
buckle
on
our
armour
if
a
moralist
is
found
to
suggest
that
perhaps
all
integrity
and
uprightness
may
be
at
bottom
only
conventional
this
is
what
holbach
helvetius
and
others
of
their
time
did
and
following
out
the
theory
they
endeavoured
with
great
acumen
to
trace
back
all
moral
conduct
to
egoistic
motives
however
remote
and
indirect
that
their
position
is
literally
true
of
most
just
actions
as
having
an
ultimate
foundation
centred
in
the
self
i
have
shown
above
that
it
is
also
true
to
a
large
extent
of
what
is
done
in
kindness
and
humanity
there
can
be
no
doubt
acts
of
this
sort
often
arise
from
love
of
ostentation
still
oftener
from
belief
in
a
retribution
to
come
which
may
be
dealt
out
in
the
second
or
even
the
third
power
or
they
can
be
explained
by
other
egoistic
motives
nevertheless
it
is
equally
certain
that
there
occur
actions
of
disinterested
and
entirely
voluntary
justice
to
prove
the
latter
statement
i
appeal
only
to
the
facts
of
experience
not
to
those
of
consciousness
there
are
isolated
yet
indisputable
cases
on
record
where
not
only
the
danger
of
legal
prosecution
but
also
all
chance
of
discovery
and
even
of
suspicion
has
been
excluded
and
where
notwithstanding
the
poor
man
has
rendered
to
the
rich
his
own
for
example
things
lost
and
found
have
been
given
back
without
any
thought
or
hope
of
reward
a
deposit
made
by
a
third
person
has
been
restored
after
his
death
to
the
rightful
owner
a
poor
man
secretly
intrusted
with
a
treasure
by
a
fugitive
has
faithfully
kept
and
then
returned
it
instances
of
this
sort
can
be
found
beyond
all
doubt
only
the
surprise
the
emotion
and
the
high
respect
awakened
when
we
hear
of
them
testify
to
the
fact
that
they
are
unexpected
and
very
exceptional
there
are
in
truth
really
honest
people
like
clover
their
existence
is
not
a
fiction
but
hamlet
uses
no
hyperbole
when
he
says
to
be
honest
as
this
world
goes
is
to
be
one
man
pick
out
of
ten
thousand
if
it
be
objected
that
after
all
religious
dogmas
involving
rewards
and
penalties
in
another
world
are
at
the
root
of
conduct
as
above
described
cases
could
probably
be
adduced
where
the
actors
possessed
no
religions
faith
whatever
and
this
is
a
thing
by
no
means
so
infrequent
as
is
generally
maintained
those
who
combat
the
appeal
specially
to
the
testimony
of
but
conscience
itself
is
impugned
and
doubts
are
raised
about
its
natural
origin
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
a
false
conscience
which
is
often
confounded
with
the
true
the
regret
and
anxiety
which
many
a
man
feels
for
what
he
has
done
is
frequently
at
bottom
nothing
but
fear
of
the
possible
consequences
not
a
few
people
if
they
break
external
voluntary
and
even
absurd
rules
suffer
from
painful
searchings
of
heart
exactly
similar
to
those
inflicted
by
the
real
conscience
thus
for
instance
a
bigoted
jew
if
on
saturday
he
should
smoke
a
pipe
at
home
becomes
really
oppressed
with
the
sense
of
having
disobeyed
the
command
in
exodus
xxxv
ye
shall
kindle
no
fire
throughout
your
habitations
upon
the
sabbath
day
how
often
it
happens
that
a
nobleman
or
officer
is
the
victim
of
because
on
some
occasion
or
other
he
has
not
properly
complied
with
that
fools
codex
which
is
called
knightly
honour
nay
more
there
are
many
of
this
class
who
if
they
see
the
impossibility
of
merely
doing
enough
in
some
quarrel
to
satisfy
the
code
to
say
nothing
of
keeping
their
pledged
word
of
honour
are
ready
to
shoot
themselves
instances
of
both
have
come
under
my
knowledge
and
this
while
the
man
would
with
an
easy
mind
break
his
promise
every
day
if
only
the
shibboleth
honour
be
not
involved
in
short
every
inconsequent
and
thoughtless
action
all
conduct
contrary
to
our
prejudices
principles
or
convictions
whatever
these
may
be
indeed
every
indiscretion
every
mistake
every
piece
of
stupidity
rankles
in
us
secretly
and
leaves
its
sting
behind
the
average
individual
who
thinks
his
conscience
such
an
imposing
structure
would
be
surprised
could
he
see
of
what
it
actually
consists
probably
of
about
fear
of
men
superstition
prejudice
vanity
and
habit
so
that
in
reality
he
is
no
better
than
the
englishman
who
said
quite
frankly
i
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
conscience
religious
people
of
every
creed
as
a
rule
understand
by
conscience
nothing
else
than
the
dogmas
and
injunctions
of
their
religion
and
the
based
thereon
and
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
expressions
of
and
of
are
used
the
same
interpretation
was
always
given
by
the
theologians
schoolmen
and
casuists
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
later
times
whatever
a
man
knew
of
the
formulae
and
prescriptions
of
the
church
coupled
with
a
resolution
to
believe
and
obey
it
constituted
his
conscience
thus
we
find
the
terms
a
doubting
conscience
an
opinionated
conscience
an
erring
conscience
and
the
like
and
councils
were
held
and
confessors
employed
for
the
special
purpose
of
setting
such
irregularities
straight
how
little
the
conception
of
conscience
just
as
other
conceptions
is
determined
by
its
own
object
how
differently
it
is
viewed
by
different
people
how
wavering
and
uncertain
it
appears
in
books
all
this
is
briefly
but
clearly
set
forth
in
stäudlin
der
lehre
vom
these
facts
taken
in
conjunction
are
not
calculated
to
establish
the
reality
of
the
thing
they
have
rather
given
rise
to
the
question
whether
there
is
in
truth
a
genuine
inborn
conscience
i
have
already
had
occasion
in
part
chapter
where
the
theory
of
freedom
is
discussed
to
touch
on
my
view
of
conscience
and
i
shall
return
to
it
below
all
these
sceptical
objections
added
together
do
not
in
the
least
avail
to
prove
that
no
true
morality
exists
however
much
they
may
moderate
our
expectations
as
to
the
moral
tendency
in
man
and
the
natural
basis
of
ethics
undoubtedly
a
great
deal
that
is
ascribed
to
the
ethical
sense
can
be
proved
to
spring
from
other
incentives
and
when
we
contemplate
the
moral
depravity
of
the
world
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
stimulus
for
good
can
not
be
very
powerful
especially
as
it
often
does
not
work
even
in
cases
where
the
opposing
motives
are
weak
although
then
the
individual
difference
of
character
makes
itself
fully
felt
it
should
be
observed
that
this
moral
depravity
is
all
the
more
difficult
to
discern
because
its
manifestations
are
checked
and
cloaked
by
public
order
as
enforced
by
law
by
the
necessity
of
having
a
good
name
and
even
by
ordinary
polite
manners
and
this
is
not
all
people
commonly
suppose
that
in
the
education
of
the
young
their
moral
interests
are
furthered
by
representing
uprightness
and
virtue
as
principles
generally
followed
by
the
world
later
on
it
is
often
to
their
great
harm
that
experience
teaches
them
something
else
for
the
discovery
that
the
instructors
of
their
early
years
were
the
first
to
deceive
them
is
likely
to
have
a
more
mischievous
effect
on
their
morality
than
if
these
persons
had
given
them
the
first
example
of
ingenuous
truthfulness
by
saying
frankly
the
world
is
sunk
in
evil
and
men
are
not
what
they
ought
to
be
but
be
not
misled
thereby
and
see
that
you
do
better
all
this
as
i
have
said
increases
the
difficulty
of
recognising
the
real
immorality
of
mankind
the
state
this
masterpiece
which
sums
up
the
intelligent
egoism
of
all
consigns
the
rights
of
each
person
to
a
power
which
being
enormously
superior
to
that
of
the
individual
compels
him
to
respect
the
rights
of
all
others
this
is
the
leash
that
restrains
the
limitless
egoism
of
nearly
every
one
the
malice
of
many
the
cruelty
of
not
a
few
the
illusion
thus
arising
is
so
great
that
when
in
special
cases
where
the
executive
power
is
ineffective
or
is
eluded
the
insatiable
covetousness
the
base
greed
the
deep
hypocrisy
or
the
spiteful
tricks
of
men
are
apparent
in
all
their
ugliness
we
recoil
with
horror
supposing
that
we
have
stumbled
on
some
monster
whereas
without
the
compulsion
of
law
and
the
necessity
of
keeping
an
honourable
name
these
sights
would
be
of
every
day
occurrence
in
order
to
discover
what
from
a
moral
point
of
view
human
beings
are
made
of
we
must
study
anarchist
records
and
the
proceedings
connected
with
criminals
the
thousands
that
throng
before
our
eyes
in
peaceful
intercourse
each
with
the
other
can
only
be
regarded
as
so
many
tigers
and
wolves
whose
teeth
are
secured
by
a
strong
muzzle
let
us
now
suppose
this
muzzle
cast
off
or
in
other
words
the
power
of
the
state
abolished
the
contemplation
of
the
spectacle
then
to
be
awaited
would
make
all
thinking
people
shudder
and
they
would
thus
betray
the
small
amount
of
trust
they
really
have
in
the
efficiency
either
of
religion
or
of
conscience
or
of
the
natural
basis
of
morals
whatever
it
be
but
if
these
immoral
antinomian
forces
should
be
unshackled
and
let
loose
it
is
precisely
then
that
the
true
moral
incentive
hidden
before
would
reveal
its
activity
and
consequently
be
most
easily
recognised
and
nothing
would
bring
out
so
clearly
as
this
the
prodigious
moral
difference
of
character
between
man
and
man
it
would
be
found
to
be
as
great
as
the
intellectual
which
is
saying
much
the
objection
will
perhaps
be
raised
that
ethics
is
not
concerned
with
what
men
actually
do
but
that
it
is
the
science
which
treats
of
what
their
conduct
to
be
now
this
is
exactly
the
position
which
i
deny
in
the
critical
part
of
the
present
treatise
i
have
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
the
conception
of
in
other
words
the
of
ethics
is
valid
only
in
theological
morals
outside
of
which
it
loses
all
sense
and
meaning
the
end
which
i
place
before
ethical
science
is
to
point
out
all
the
varied
moral
lines
of
human
conduct
to
explain
them
and
to
trace
them
to
their
ultimate
source
consequently
there
remains
no
way
of
discovering
the
basis
of
ethics
except
the
empirical
we
must
search
and
see
whether
we
can
find
any
actions
to
which
we
are
obliged
to
ascribe
moral
actions
that
is
of
voluntary
justice
of
pure
and
of
true
nobleness
such
conduct
when
found
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
given
phaenomenon
which
has
to
be
properly
accounted
for
in
other
words
its
real
origin
must
be
explored
and
this
will
involve
the
investigation
and
explanation
of
the
peculiar
motives
which
lead
men
to
actions
so
radically
distinct
from
all
others
that
they
form
a
class
by
themselves
these
motives
together
with
a
responsive
susceptibility
for
them
will
constitute
the
ultimate
basis
of
morality
and
the
knowledge
of
them
will
be
the
foundation
of
ethics
this
is
the
humble
path
to
which
i
direct
the
science
of
morals
it
contains
no
construction
no
absolute
legislation
for
all
rational
beings
it
lacks
all
official
academic
sanction
therefore
whoever
thinks
it
not
sufficiently
fashionable
may
return
to
the
categorical
imperative
to
the
shibboleth
of
human
dignity
to
the
empty
phrases
the
cobwebs
and
the
of
the
schools
to
principles
on
which
experience
pours
contempt
at
every
step
and
of
which
no
one
outside
the
knows
anything
or
has
ever
had
the
least
notion
on
the
other
hand
the
foundation
which
is
reached
by
following
my
path
is
upheld
by
experience
and
it
is
experience
which
daily
and
hourly
delivers
its
silent
testimony
in
favour
of
my
theory
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
by
nature
but
these
things
are
decided
by
human
judgment

chapter
iii
antimoral
incentives
the
chief
and
fundamental
incentive
in
man
as
in
animals
is
that
is
the
urgent
impulse
to
exist
and
exist
under
the
best
circumstances
the
german
word
involves
a
false
secondary
idea
of
disease
the
term
denotes
egoism
so
far
as
the
latter
is
guided
by
reason
which
enables
it
by
means
of
reflection
to
prosecute
its
purposes
systematically
so
that
animals
may
be
called
egoistic
but
not
i
shall
therefore
retain
the
word
for
the
general
idea
now
this
egoism
is
both
in
animals
and
men
connected
in
the
closest
way
with
their
very
essence
and
being
indeed
it
is
one
and
the
same
thing
for
this
reason
all
human
actions
as
a
rule
have
their
origin
in
egoism
and
to
it
accordingly
we
must
always
first
turn
when
we
try
to
find
the
explanation
of
any
given
line
of
conduct
just
as
when
the
endeavour
is
made
to
guide
a
man
in
any
direction
the
means
to
this
end
are
universally
calculated
with
reference
to
the
same
motive
egoism
is
from
its
nature
limitless
the
individual
is
filled
with
the
unqualified
desire
of
preserving
his
life
and
of
keeping
it
free
from
all
pain
under
which
is
included
all
want
and
privation
he
wishes
to
have
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
pleasurable
existence
and
every
gratification
that
he
is
capable
of
appreciating
indeed
he
attempts
if
possible
to
evolve
fresh
capacities
for
enjoyment
everything
that
opposes
the
strivings
of
his
egoism
awakens
his
dislike
his
anger
his
hate
this
is
the
mortal
enemy
which
he
tries
to
annihilate
if
it
were
possible
he
would
like
to
possess
everything
for
his
own
pleasure
as
this
is
impossible
he
wishes
at
least
to
control
everything
all
things
for
me
and
nothing
for
others
is
his
maxim
egoism
is
a
huge
giant
overtopping
the
world
if
each
person
were
allowed
to
choose
between
his
own
destruction
and
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
i
need
not
say
what
the
decision
would
be
in
most
cases
thus
it
is
that
every
human
unit
makes
himself
the
centre
of
the
world
which
he
views
exclusively
from
that
standpoint
whatever
occurs
even
for
instance
the
most
sweeping
changes
in
the
destinies
of
nations
he
brings
into
relation
first
and
foremost
with
his
own
interests
which
however
slightly
and
indirectly
they
may
be
affected
he
is
sure
to
think
of
before
anything
else
no
sharper
contrast
can
be
imagined
than
that
between
the
profound
and
exclusive
attention
which
each
person
devotes
to
his
own
self
and
the
indifference
with
which
as
a
rule
all
other
people
regard
that
self
an
indifference
precisely
like
that
with
which
he
in
turn
looks
upon
them
to
a
certain
extent
it
is
actually
comic
to
see
how
each
individual
out
of
innumerable
multitudes
considers
himself
at
least
from
the
practical
point
of
view
as
the
only
real
thing
and
all
others
in
some
sort
as
mere
phantoms
the
ultimate
reason
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
every
one
is
conscious
of
himself
but
of
others
only
through
his
mind
eye
and
the
direct
impression
asserts
its
right
in
other
words
it
is
in
consequence
of
the
subjectivity
which
is
essential
to
our
consciousness
that
each
person
is
himself
the
whole
world
for
all
that
is
objective
exists
only
indirectly
as
simply
the
mental
picture
of
the
subject
whence
it
comes
about
that
everything
is
invariably
expressed
in
terms
of
the
only
world
which
the
individual
really
grasps
and
of
which
he
has
certain
knowledge
he
carries
in
himself
as
a
mirrored
image
fashioned
by
his
brain
and
he
is
therefore
its
centre
consequently
he
is
all
in
all
to
himself
and
since
he
feels
that
he
contains
within
his
ego
all
that
is
real
nothing
can
be
of
greater
importance
to
him
than
his
own
self
moreover
this
supremely
important
self
this
microcosm
to
which
the
macrocosm
stands
in
relation
as
its
mere
modification
or
accident
this
which
is
the
individual
whole
world
he
knows
perfectly
well
must
be
destroyed
by
death
which
is
therefore
for
him
equivalent
to
the
destruction
of
all
things
such
then
are
the
elements
out
of
which
on
the
basis
of
the
will
to
live
egoism
grows
up
and
like
a
broad
trench
it
forms
a
perennial
separation
between
man
and
man
if
on
any
occasion
some
one
actually
jumps
across
to
help
another
such
an
act
is
regarded
as
a
sort
of
miracle
which
calls
forth
amazement
and
wins
approval
in
part
chapter
where
kant
principle
of
morals
is
discussed
i
had
the
opportunity
of
describing
how
egoism
behaves
in
everyday
life
where
it
is
always
peering
out
of
some
corner
or
other
despite
ordinary
politeness
which
like
the
traditional
is
used
as
a
covering
in
point
of
fact
politeness
is
the
conventional
and
systematic
disavowal
of
egoism
in
the
trifles
of
daily
intercourse
and
is
of
course
a
piece
of
recognised
hypocrisy
gentle
manners
are
expected
and
commended
because
that
which
they
conceal
egoism
is
so
odious
that
no
one
wishes
to
see
it
however
much
it
is
known
to
be
there
just
as
people
like
to
have
repulsive
objects
hidden
at
least
by
a
curtain
now
unless
external
force
under
which
must
be
included
every
source
of
fear
whether
of
human
or
superhuman
powers
or
else
the
real
moral
incentive
is
in
effective
operation
it
is
certain
that
egoism
always
pursues
its
purposes
with
unqualified
directness
hence
without
these
checks
considering
the
countless
number
of
egoistic
individuals
the
omnium
contra
would
be
the
order
of
the
day
and
prove
the
ruin
of
all
thus
is
explained
the
early
construction
by
reflecting
reason
of
state
government
which
arising
as
it
does
from
a
mutual
fear
of
reciprocal
violence
obviates
the
disastrous
consequences
of
the
general
egoism
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
by
procedure
where
however
the
two
forces
that
oppose
egoism
fail
to
be
operative
the
latter
is
not
slow
to
reveal
all
its
horrible
dimensions
nor
is
the
spectacle
exactly
attractive
in
order
to
express
the
strength
of
this
antimoral
power
in
a
few
words
to
portray
it
so
to
say
at
one
stroke
some
very
emphatic
hyperbole
is
wanted
it
may
be
put
thus
many
a
man
would
be
quite
capable
of
killing
another
simply
to
rub
his
boots
over
with
the
victim
fat
i
am
only
doubtful
whether
this
after
all
is
any
exaggeration
then
is
the
first
and
principal
though
not
the
only
power
that
the
has
to
contend
against
and
it
is
surely
sufficiently
clear
that
the
latter
in
order
to
enter
the
lists
against
such
an
opponent
must
be
something
more
real
than
a
sophism
or
an
in
war
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
know
the
enemy
well
and
in
the
shock
of
battle
now
impending
as
the
chief
combatant
on
its
own
side
is
best
set
against
the
virtue
of
which
in
my
opinion
is
the
first
and
original
cardinal
virtue
the
virtue
of
on
the
other
hand
is
rather
to
be
matched
with
or
the
origin
and
successive
stages
of
which
we
will
now
consider
in
its
lower
degrees
is
very
frequent
indeed
almost
a
common
thing
and
it
easily
rises
in
the
scale
goethe
is
assuredly
right
when
he
says
that
in
this
world
indifference
and
aversion
are
quite
at
part
chap
it
is
very
fortunate
for
us
that
the
cloak
which
prudence
and
politeness
throw
over
this
vice
prevents
us
from
seeing
how
general
it
is
and
how
the
omnium
contra
is
constantly
waged
at
least
in
thought
yet
ever
and
anon
there
is
some
appearance
of
it
for
instance
in
the
relentless
backbiting
so
frequently
observed
while
its
clearest
manifestation
is
found
in
all
of
anger
which
for
the
most
part
are
quite
disproportional
to
their
cause
and
which
could
hardly
be
so
violent
had
they
not
been
compressed
like
gunpowder
into
the
explosive
compound
formed
of
long
cherished
brooding
hatred
usually
arises
from
the
unavoidable
collisions
of
egoism
which
occur
at
every
step
it
is
moreover
objectively
excited
by
the
view
of
the
weakness
the
folly
the
vices
failings
shortcomings
and
imperfections
of
all
kinds
which
every
one
more
or
less
at
least
occasionally
affords
to
others
indeed
the
spectacle
is
such
that
many
a
man
especially
in
moments
of
melancholy
and
depression
may
be
tempted
to
regard
the
world
from
the
aesthetic
standpoint
as
a
cabinet
of
caricatures
from
the
intellectual
as
a
madhouse
and
from
the
moral
as
a
nest
of
sharpers
if
such
a
mental
attitude
be
indulged
misanthropy
is
the
result
lastly
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
is
envy
or
rather
the
latter
is
itself
kindled
by
the
happiness
possessions
or
advantages
of
others
no
one
is
absolutely
free
from
envy
and

envy
is
a
natural
growth
in
man
from
the
beginning
but
its
degrees
vary
considerably
it
is
most
poisonous
and
implacable
when
directed
against
personal
qualities
because
then
the
envious
have
nothing
to
hope
for
and
precisely
in
such
cases
its
vilest
form
also
appears
because
men
are
made
to
hate
what
they

the

is
referred

the

the
former
is

the
latter
is
diabolical

in
practice
they
become
malice
and
cruelty
it
is
true
that
egoism
may
lead
to
wickedness
and
crime
of
every
sort
but
the
resulting
injury
and
pain
to
others
are
simply
the
means
not
the
end
and
are
therefore
involved
only
as
an
accident
whereas
malice
and
cruelty
make
misery
the
end
in
itself
the
realisation
of
which
affords
distinct
pleasure
they
therefore
constitute
a
higher
degree
of
moral
turpitude
the
maxim
of
egoism
at
its
worst
is
juva
immo
omnes
si
forte
thus
there
is
always
a
condition
help
no
body
but
rather
injure
all
people
if
it
brings
you
any
advantage
the
guiding
rule
of
malice
is
quantum
potes
injure
all
people
as
far
as
you
can
as
malicious
joy
is
in
fact
theoretical
cruelty
so
conversely
cruelty
is
nothing
but
malicious
joy
put
into
practice
and
the
latter
is
sure
to
show
itself
in
the
form
of
cruelty
directly
an
opportunity
offers
an
examination
of
the
special
vices
that
spring
from
these
two
primary
antimoral
forces
forms
no
part
of
the
present
treatise
its
proper
place
would
be
found
in
a
detailed
system
of
ethics
from
we
should
probably
derive
greed
gluttony
lust
selfishness
avarice
covetousness
injustice
hardness
of
heart
pride
arrogance
etc
while
to
might
be
ascribed
disaffection
envy
malice
pleasure
in
seeing
others
suffer
prying
curiosity
slander
insolence
petulance
hatred
anger
treachery
fraud
thirst
for
revenge
cruelty
etc
the
first
root
is
more
bestial
the
second
more
devilish
and
according
as
either
is
the
stronger
or
according
as
the
moral
incentive
to
be
described
below
predominates
so
the
salient
points
for
the
ethical
classification
of
character
are
determined
no
man
is
entirely
free
from
some
traces
of
all
three
here
i
bring
to
an
end
my
review
of
these
terrible
powers
of
evil
it
is
an
array
reminding
one
of
the
princes
of
darkness
in
pandemonium
but
my
plan
which
in
this
respect
of
course
differs
from
that
of
all
other
moralists
required
me
to
consider
at
the
outset
this
gloomy
side
of
human
nature
and
like
dante
to
descend
first
to
tartarus
it
will
now
be
fully
apparent
how
difficult
our
problem
is
we
have
to
find
a
motive
capable
of
making
a
man
take
up
a
line
of
conduct
directly
opposed
to
all
those
propensities
which
lie
deeply
ingrained
in
his
nature
or
given
such
conduct
as
a
fact
of
experience
we
must
search
for
a
motive
capable
of
supplying
an
adequate
and
explanation
of
it
the
difficulty
in
fact
is
so
great
that
in
order
to
solve
it
for
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
it
has
been
everywhere
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
machinery
from
another
world
gods
have
been
pointed
to
whose
will
and
command
the
required
mode
of
behaviour
was
said
to
be
and
who
were
represented
as
emphasising
this
command
by
penalties
and
rewards
either
in
this
or
in
another
world
to
which
death
would
be
the
gate
now
let
us
assume
that
belief
in
a
doctrine
of
this
sort
took
general
root
a
thing
which
is
certainly
possible
through
strenuous
inculcation
at
a
very
early
age
and
let
us
also
assume
that
it
brought
about
the
intended
effect
though
this
is
a
much
harder
matter
to
admit
and
not
nearly
so
well
confirmed
by
experience
we
should
then
no
doubt
succeed
in
obtaining
strict
legality
of
action
even
beyond
the
limits
that
justice
and
the
police
can
reach
but
every
one
feels
that
this
would
not
in
the
least
imply
what
we
mean
by
morality
of
the
heart
for
obviously
every
act
arising
from
motives
like
those
just
mentioned
is
after
all
derived
simply
from
pure
egoism
how
can
i
talk
of
unselfishness
when
i
am
enticed
by
a
promised
guerdon
or
deterred
by
a
threatened
punishment
a
recompense
in
another
world
thoroughly
believed
in
must
be
regarded
as
a
bill
of
exchange
which
is
perfectly
safe
though
only
payable
at
a
very
distant
date
it
is
thus
quite
possible
that
the
profuse
assurances
which
beggars
so
constantly
make
that
those
who
relieve
them
will
receive
a
thousandfold
more
for
their
gifts
in
the
next
world
may
lead
many
a
miser
to
generous
for
such
a
one
complacently
views
the
matter
as
a
good
investment
of
money
being
perfectly
convinced
that
he
will
rise
again
as
a
croesus
for
the
mass
of
mankind
it
will
perhaps
be
always
necessary
to
continue
the
appeal
to
incentives
of
this
nature
and
we
know
that
such
is
the
teaching
promulgated
by
the
different
religions
which
are
in
fact
the
of
the
be
it
however
observed
in
this
connection
that
a
man
is
sometimes
just
as
much
in
error
as
to
the
true
motives
that
govern
his
own
acts
as
he
is
with
regard
to
those
of
others
hence
it
is
certain
that
many
persons
while
they
can
only
account
to
themselves
for
their
noblest
actions
by
attributing
them
to
motives
of
the
kind
above
described
are
nevertheless
really
guided
in
their
conduct
by
far
higher
and
purer
incentives
though
the
latter
may
be
much
more
difficult
to
discover
they
are
doing
no
doubt
out
of
direct
love
of
their
neighbour
that
which
they
can
but
explain
as
the
command
of
their
god
on
the
other
hand
philosophy
in
dealing
with
this
as
with
all
other
problems
endeavours
to
extract
the
true
and
ultimate
cause
of
the
given
phaenomena
from
the
disclosures
which
the
nature
itself
of
man
yields
and
which
freed
as
they
must
be
from
all
mythical
interpretation
from
all
religious
dogmas
and
transcendent
hypostases
she
requires
to
see
confirmed
by
external
or
internal
experience
now
as
our
present
task
is
a
philosophical
one
we
must
entirely
disregard
all
solutions
conditioned
by
any
religion
and
i
have
here
touched
on
them
merely
in
order
to
throw
a
stronger
light
on
the
magnitude
of
the
difficulty
i
venture
to
use
this
word
although
irregularly
formed
because
antiethical
would
not
here
give
an
adequate
meaning
in
accordance
with
good
manners
and
contrary
to
good
manners
which
have
lately
come
into
vogue
are
bad
substitutes
for
moral
and
immoral
first
because
is
a
scientific
conception
which
as
such
requires
to
be
denoted
by
a
greek
or
latin
term
for
reasons
which
may
be
found
in
welt
als
wille
und
vol
chap
sqq
and
secondly
because
is
a
weaker
and
tamer
expression
difficult
to
distinguish
from
modest
which
in
popular
acceptation
means
simpering
no
concessions
must
be
made
to
this
extravagant
love
of
germanising
in
sick
and
seek
there
is
an
apparent
confusion
between
the
two
bases
suk
to
be
ill
and
sôkyan
to
seek

it
should
be
noticed
that
while
from
the
side
a
self
assumes
these
gigantic
proportions
it
shrinks
to
almost
nothing
namely
to
about
the
part
of
the
human
race
the

of

against
all
hobbes

chapter
iv
criterion
of
actions
of
moral
worth
there
is
first
the
empirical
question
to
be
settled
whether
actions
of
voluntary
justice
and
unselfish
which
are
capable
of
rising
to
nobleness
and
magnanimity
actually
occur
in
experience
unfortunately
this
inquiry
can
not
be
decided
altogether
empirically
because
it
is
invariably
only
the
act
that
experience
gives
the
not
being
apparent
hence
the
possibility
always
remains
that
an
egoistic
motive
may
have
had
weight
in
determining
a
just
or
good
deed
in
a
theoretical
investigation
like
the
present
i
shall
not
avail
myself
of
the
inexcusable
trick
of
shifting
the
matter
on
to
the
reader
conscience
but
i
believe
there
are
few
people
who
have
any
doubt
about
the
matter
and
who
are
not
convinced
from
their
own
experience
that
just
acts
are
often
performed
simply
and
solely
to
prevent
a
man
suffering
from
injustice
most
of
as
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
are
persuaded
that
there
are
persons
in
whom
the
principle
of
giving
others
their
due
seems
to
be
innate
who
neither
intentionally
injure
any
one
nor
unconditionally
seek
their
own
advantage
but
in
considering
themselves
show
regard
also
for
the
rights
of
their
neighbours
persons
who
when
they
undertake
matters
involving
reciprocal
obligations
not
only
see
that
the
other
party
does
his
duty
but
also
that
he
gets
his
own
because
it
is
really
against
their
will
that
any
one
with
whom
they
have
to
do
should
be
shabbily
treated
these
are
the
men
of
true
probity
the
few
just
among
the
countless
number
of
the
unjust
such
people
exist
similarly
it
will
be
admitted
i
think
that
many
help
and
give
perform
services
and
deny
themselves
without
having
any
further
intention
in
their
hearts
than
that
of
assisting
another
whose
distress
they
see
when
arnold
von
winkelried
exclaimed
lieben
eidgenossen
wullt
minem
wip
und
kinde
and
then
clasped
in
his
arms
as
many
hostile
spears
as
he
could
grasp
can
any
one
believe
that
he
had
some
selfish
purpose
i
can
not
to
cases
of
voluntary
justice
which
can
not
be
denied
without
deliberate
and
wilful
trifling
with
facts
i
have
already
drawn
attention
in
chapter
ii
of
this
part
should
any
one
however
persist
in
refusing
to
believe
that
such
actions
ever
happen
then
according
to
his
view
ethics
would
be
a
science
without
any
real
object
like
astrology
and
alchemy
and
it
would
be
waste
of
time
to
discuss
its
basis
any
further
with
him
therefore
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
address
myself
to
those
who
allow
that
we
are
dealing
with
something
more
than
an
imaginary
citation
it
is
then
only
to
conduct
of
the
above
kind
that
genuine
moral
worth
can
be
ascribed
its
special
mark
is
that
it
rejects
and
excludes
the
whole
class
of
motives
by
which
otherwise
all
human
action
is
prompted
i
mean
the
motives
using
the
word
in
its
widest
sense
consequently
the
moral
value
of
an
act
is
lowered
by
the
disclosure
of
an
accessory
selfish
incentive
while
it
is
entirely
destroyed
if
that
incentive
stood
alone
the
absence
of
all
egoistic
motives
is
thus
the
of
an
action
of
moral
value
it
may
no
doubt
be
objected
that
also
acts
of
pure
malice
and
cruelty
are
not
selfish
but
it
is
manifest
that
the
latter
can
not
be
meant
since
they
are
in
kind
the
exact
opposite
of
those
now
being
considered
if
however
the
definition
be
insisted
on
in
its
strict
sense
then
we
may
expressly
except
such
actions
because
of
their
essential
token
the
compassing
of
others
suffering
there
is
also
another
characteristic
of
conduct
having
real
moral
worth
which
is
entirely
internal
and
therefore
less
obvious
i
allude
to
the
fact
that
it
leaves
behind
a
certain
which
is
called
the
approval
of
conscience
just
as
on
the
other
hand
injustice
and
unkindness
and
still
more
malice
and
cruelty
involve
a
secret
lastly
there
is
an
external
secondary
and
accidental
sign
that
draws
a
clear
line
between
the
two
classes
acts
of
the
former
kind
win
the
approval
and
respect
of
disinterested
witnesses
those
of
the
latter
incur
their
disapproval
and
contempt
those
actions
that
bear
the
stamp
of
moral
value
so
determined
and
admitted
to
be
realities
constitute
the
phaenomenon
that
lies
before
us
and
which
we
have
to
explain
we
must
accordingly
search
out
what
it
is
that
moves
men
to
such
conduct
if
we
succeed
in
our
investigation
we
shall
necessarily
bring
to
light
the
true
moral
incentive
and
as
it
is
upon
this
that
all
ethical
science
must
depend
our
problem
will
then
be
solved
comrades
true
and
loyal
to
our
oath
care
for
my
wife
and

in
remembrance
of
this
acts
of
malice
and

are
so
many
gratifications
of
the
ego
and
are
therefore

a
certain
sense

pp

and

statement
and
proof
of
the
only
true
moral
incentive
the
preceding
considerations
which
were
unavoidably
necessary
in
order
to
clear
the
ground
now
enable
me
to
indicate
the
true
incentive
which
underlies
all
acts
of
real
moral
worth
the
seriousness
and
indisputable
genuineness
with
which
we
shall
find
it
is
distinguished
removes
it
far
indeed
from
the
subtleties
sophisms
assertions
formulated
out
of
airy
nothings
and
which
all
systems
up
to
the
present
have
tried
to
make
at
once
the
source
of
moral
conduct
and
the
basis
of
ethics
this
incentive
i
shall
not
put
forward
as
an
hypothesis
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
as
one
pleases
i
shall
actually
that
it
is
the
only
possible
one
but
as
this
demonstration
requires
several
fundamental
truths
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
reader
attention
is
first
called
to
certain
propositions
which
we
must
presuppose
and
which
may
properly
be
considered
as
axioms
except
the
last
two
which
result
from
the
analysis
contained
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
in
part
chapter
iii
no
action
can
take
place
without
a
sufficient
motive
as
little
as
a
stone
can
move
without
a
sufficient
push
or
pull
similarly
no
action
can
be
left
undone
when
given
the
character
of
the
doer
a
sufficient
motive
is
present
unless
a
stronger
necessarily
prevents
it
whatever
moves
the
will
this
and
this
alone
implies
the
sense
of
weal
and
woe
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
term
and
conversely
weal
and
woe
signify
that
which
is
in
conformity
with
or
which
is
contrary
to
a
will
hence
every
motive
must
have
a
connection
with
weal
and
woe
consequently
every
action
stands
in
relation
to
and
has
as
its
ultimate
object
a
being
susceptible
of
weal
and
woe
this
being
is
either
the
doer
himself
or
another
whose
position
as
regards
the
action
is
therefore
since
it
is
done
either
to
his
harm
or
to
his
benefit
and
advantage
every
action
which
has
to
do
as
its
ultimate
object
with
the
weal
and
woe
of
the
agent
himself
is
the
foregoing
propositions
with
regard
to
what
is
done
apply
equally
to
what
is
left
undone
in
all
cases
where
motive
and
play
their
parts
from
the
analysis
in
the
foregoing
chapter
it
results
that
and
the
of
an
action
absolutely
exclude
each
other
if
an
act
have
an
object
as
its
motive
then
no
moral
value
can
be
attached
to
it
if
an
act
is
to
have
moral
value
then
no
egoistic
object
direct
or
indirect
near
or
remote
may
be
its
motive
in
consequence
of
my
elimination
in
part
chapter
of
alleged
duties
towards
ourselves
the
moral
significance
of
our
conduct
can
only
lie
in
the
effect
produced
upon
others
its
relation
to
the
latter
is
alone
that
which
lends
it
moral
worth
or
worthlessness
and
constitutes
it
an
act
of
justice
or
the
reverse
from
these
propositions
the
following
conclusion
is
obvious
the
and
which
according
to
our
third
axiom
must
as
its
ultimate
object
lie
at
the
root
of
everything
done
or
left
undone
is
either
that
of
the
doer
himself
or
that
of
some
other
person
whose
with
reference
to
the
action
is
passive
conduct
in
the
first
case
is
necessarily
as
it
is
impelled
by
an
interested
motive
and
this
is
not
only
true
when
men
as
they
nearly
always
do
plainly
shape
their
acts
for
their
own
profit
and
advantage
it
is
equally
true
when
from
anything
done
we
expect
some
benefit
to
ourselves
no
matter
how
remote
whether
in
this
or
in
another
world
nor
is
it
less
the
fact
when
our
honour
our
good
name
or
the
wish
to
win
the
respect
of
some
one
the
sympathy
of
the
lookers
on
is
the
object
we
have
in
view
or
when
our
intention
is
to
uphold
a
rule
of
conduct
which
if
generally
followed
would
occasionally
be
useful
to
ourselves
for
instance
the
principle
of
justice
of
mutual
succour
and
aid
and
so
forth
similarly
the
proceeding
is
at
bottom
egoistic
when
a
man
considers
it
a
prudent
step
to
obey
some
absolute
command
issued
by
an
unknown
but
evidently
supreme
power
for
in
such
a
case
nothing
can
be
the
motive
but
of
the
disastrous
consequences
of
disobedience
however
generally
and
indistinctly
these
may
be
conceived
nor
is
it
a
whit
the
less
egoism
that
prompts
us
when
we
endeavour
to
emphasise
by
something
done
or
left
undone
the
high
opinion
whether
distinctly
realised
or
not
which
we
have
of
ourselves
and
of
our
value
or
dignity
for
the
diminution
of
which
might
otherwise
occur
would
involve
the
wounding
of
our
pride
lastly
it
is
still
egoism
that
is
operative
when
a
man
following
wolff
principles
seeks
by
his
conduct
to
work
out
his
own
perfection
in
short
one
may
make
the
ultimate
incentive
to
an
action
what
one
pleases
it
will
always
turn
out
no
matter
by
how
circuitous
a
path
that
in
the
last
resort
what
affects
the
actual
weal
and
woe
of
the
agent
himself
is
the
real
motive
consequently
what
he
does
is
and
therefore
moral
there
is
only
a
single
case
in
which
this
fails
to
happen
namely
when
the
ultimate
incentive
for
doing
something
or
leaving
it
undone
is
precisely
and
exclusively
centred
in
the
weal
and
woe
of
some
one
else
who
plays
a
passive
part
that
is
to
say
when
the
person
on
the
active
side
by
what
he
does
or
omits
to
do
simply
and
solely
regards
the
weal
and
woe
of
another
and
has
absolutely
no
other
object
than
to
benefit
him
by
keeping
harm
from
his
door
or
it
may
be
even
by
affording
help
assistance
and
relief
it
is
this
aim
alone
that
gives
to
what
is
done
or
left
undone
the
stamp
of
moral
worth
which
is
thus
seen
to
depend
exclusively
on
the
circumstance
that
the
act
is
carried
out
or
omitted
purely
for
the
benefit
and
advantage
of
another
if
and
when
this
is
not
so
then
the
question
of
weal
and
woe
which
incites
to
or
deters
from
every
action
contemplated
can
only
relate
to
the
agent
himself
whence
its
performance
or
is
entirely
egoistic
and
without
moral
value
but
if
what
i
do
is
to
take
place
solely
on
account
of
some
one
else
then
it
follows
that
weal
and
woe
must
directly
constitute
motive
just
is
ordinarily
weal
and
woe
form
it
this
narrows
the
limits
of
our
problem
which
may
now
be
stated
as
follows
how
is
it
possible
that
another
weal
and
woe
should
influence
my
will
directly
that
is
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
otherwise
my
own
move
it
how
can
that
which
affects
another
for
good
or
bad
become
my
immediate
motive
and
actually
sometimes
assume
such
importance
that
it
more
or
less
supplants
my
own
interests
which
are
as
a
rule
the
single
source
of
the
incentives
that
appeal
to
me
obviously
only
because
that
other
person
becomes
the
ultimate
object
of
my
will
precisely
as
usually
i
myself
am
that
object
in
other
words
because
i
directly
desire
weal
and
not
woe
for
him
just
as
habitually
i
do
for
myself
this
however
necessarily
implies
that
i
suffer
with
him
and
feel
his
woe
exactly
as
in
most
cases
i
feel
only
mine
and
therefore
desire
his
weal
as
immediately
as
at
other
times
i
desire
only
my
own
but
for
this
to
be
possible
i
must
in
some
way
or
other
be
with
him
that
is
the
between
myself
and
him
which
is
the
precise
of
my
egoism
must
be
at
least
to
a
certain
extent
now
since
i
do
not
live
in
his
skin
there
remains
only
the
knowledge
that
is
the
mental
picture
i
have
of
him
as
the
possible
means
whereby
i
can
so
far
identify
myself
with
him
that
my
action
declares
the
difference
to
be
practically
effaced
the
process
here
analysed
is
not
a
dream
a
fancy
floating
in
the
air
it
is
perfectly
real
and
by
no
means
infrequent
it
is
what
we
see
every
day
the
phaenomenon
of
in
other
words
the
direct
participation
independent
of
all
ulterior
considerations
in
the
sufferings
of
another
leading
to
sympathetic
assistance
in
the
effort
to
prevent
or
remove
them
whereon
in
the
last
resort
all
satisfaction
and
all
and
happiness
depend
it
is
this
compassion
alone
which
is
the
real
basis
of
all
justice
and
all
only
so
far
as
an
action
springs
therefrom
has
it
moral
value
and
all
conduct
that
proceeds
from
any
other
motive
whatever
has
none
when
once
compassion
is
stirred
within
me
by
another
pain
then
his
weal
and
woe
go
straight
to
my
heart
exactly
in
the
same
way
if
not
always
to
the
same
degree
as
otherwise
i
feel
only
my
own
consequently
the
difference
between
myself
and
him
is
no
longer
an
absolute
one
no
doubt
this
operation
is
astonishing
indeed
hardly
comprehensible
it
is
in
fact
the
great
mystery
of
ethics
its
original
phaenomenon
and
the
boundary
stone
past
which
only
transcendental
speculation
may
dare
to
take
a
step
herein
we
see
the
wall
of
partition
which
according
to
the
light
of
nature
as
reason
is
called
by
old
theologians
entirely
separates
being
from
being
broken
down
and
the
to
a
certain
extent
identified
with
the
ego
i
wish
for
the
moment
to
leave
the
metaphysical
explanation
of
this
enigma
untouched
and
first
to
inquire
whether
all
acts
of
voluntary
justice
and
true
really
arise
from
it
if
so
our
problem
will
be
solved
for
we
shall
have
found
the
ultimate
basis
of
morality
and
shown
that
it
lies
in
human
nature
itself
this
foundation
however
in
its
turn
can
not
form
a
problem
of
ethics
but
rather
like
every
other
ultimate
fact
as
such
of
metaphysics
only
the
solution
that
the
latter
offers
of
the
primary
ethical
phaenomenon
lies
outside
the
limits
of
the
question
put
by
the
danish
royal
society
which
is
concerned
solely
with
the
basis
so
that
the
transcendental
explanation
can
be
given
merely
as
a
voluntary
and
unessential
appendix
but
before
i
turn
to
the
derivation
of
the
cardinal
virtues
from
the
original
incentive
as
here
disclosed
i
have
still
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
reader
two
observations
which
the
subject
renders
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
easier
comprehension
i
have
simplified
the
above
presentation
of
compassion
as
the
sole
source
of
truly
moral
actions
by
intentionally
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
incentive
of
which
while
it
is
equally
useless
to
the
self
as
compassion
makes
the
of
others
its
ultimate
purpose
we
are
now
however
in
a
position
by
including
it
to
state
the
above
proof
more
completely
and
rigorously
as
follows
there
are
only
fundamental
springs
of
human
conduct
and
all
possible
motives
arise
from
one
or
other
of
these
they
are
egoism
which
desires
the
weal
of
the
self
and
is
limitless
malice
which
desires
the
woe
of
others
and
may
develop
to
the
utmost
cruelty
compassion
which
desires
the
weal
of
others
and
may
rise
to
nobleness
and
magnanimity
every
human
act
is
referable
to
one
of
these
springs
although
two
of
them
may
work
together
now
as
we
have
assumed
that
actions
of
moral
worth
are
in
point
of
fact
realities
it
follows
that
they
also
must
proceed
from
one
of
these
primal
sources
but
by
the
eighth
axiom
they
can
not
arise
from
the
first
and
still
less
from
the
second
since
all
conduct
springing
from
the
latter
is
morally
worthless
while
the
offshoots
of
the
former
are
in
part
neither
good
nor
bad
in
themselves
hence
they
must
have
their
origin
in
the
third
incentive
and
this
will
be
established
in
the
sequel
direct
sympathy
with
another
is
limited
to
his
sufferings
and
is
not
immediately
awakened
by
his
the
latter
leaves
us
indifferent
rousseau
in
his
bk
iv
expresses
the
same
view
maxime
il
pas
dans
le
cœur
humain
de
se
mettre
à
la
place
des
gens
qui
sont
plus
heureux
que
nous
mais
seulement
de
ceux
qui
sont
plus
à
etc
the
reason
of
this
is
that
pain
or
suffering
which
includes
all
want
privation
need
indeed
every
wish
is
and
works
on
the
consciousness
whereas
the
nature
of
satisfaction
of
enjoyment
of
happiness
and
the
like
consists
solely
in
the
fact
that
a
hardship
is
done
away
with
a
pain
lulled
whence
their
effect
is
we
thus
see
why
need
or
desire
is
the
condition
of
every
pleasure
plato
understood
this
well
enough
and
only
excepted
sweet
odours
and
intellectual
enjoyment
edit
bipont
and
voltaire
says
pas
de
vrais
plaisirs
de
vrais
pain
then
is
and
makes
itself
known
by
itself
satisfaction
or
pleasure
is
simply
the
removal
of
the
former
this
principle
explains
the
fact
that
only
the
suffering
the
want
the
danger
the
helplessness
of
another
awakens
our
sympathy
directly
and
as
such
the
lucky
or
contented
man
leaves
us
indifferent
in
reality
because
his
state
is
negative
he
is
without
pain
indigence
or
distress
we
may
of
course
take
pleasure
in
the
success
the
the
enjoyment
of
others
but
if
we
do
it
is
a
secondary
pleasure
and
caused
by
our
having
previously
sorrowed
over
their
sufferings
and
privations
or
else
we
share
the
joy
and
happiness
of
a
man
not
but
because
and
in
so
far
as
he
is
our
child
father
friend
relation
servant
subject
etc
in
a
word
the
good
fortune
or
pleasure
of
another
as
does
not
arouse
in
us
the
same
direct
sympathy
as
is
certainly
elicited
by
his
misfortune
privation
or
misery
as
if
even
on
own
it
is
only
suffering
under
which
must
be
reckoned
all
wants
needs
wishes
and
even
ennui
that
stirs
our
activity
and
if
contentment
and
prosperity
fill
us
with
indolence
and
lazy
repose
why
should
it
not
be
the
same
when
others
are
concerned
for
as
we
have
seen
our
sympathy
rests
on
an
identification
of
ourselves
with
them
indeed
the
sight
of
success
and
enjoyment
as
is
very
apt
to
raise
the
envy
to
which
every
man
is
prone
and
which
has
its
place
among
the
antimoral
forces
enumerated
above
in
connection
with
the
exposition
of
compassion
here
given
as
the
coming
into
play
of
motives
directly
occasioned
by
another
calamity
i
take
the
opportunity
of
condemning
the
mistake
of
cassina
which
has
been
so
often
repeated
his
view
is
that
compassion
arises
from
a
sudden
hallucination
which
makes
us
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
the
sufferer
and
then
imagine
that
we
are
undergoing
pain
in
own
this
is
not
in
the
least
the
case
the
conviction
never
leaves
us
for
a
moment
that
he
is
the
sufferer
not
we
and
it
is
precisely
in
his
person
not
in
ours
that
we
feel
the
distress
which
afflicts
us
we
suffer
him
and
therefore
in
him
we
feel
his
trouble
as
and
are
not
under
the
delusion
that
it
is
ours
indeed
the
happier
we
are
the
greater
the
contrast
between
our
own
state
and
his
the
more
we
are
open
to
the
promptings
of
compassion
the
explanation
of
the
possibility
of
this
extraordinary
phaenomenon
is
however
not
so
easy
nor
is
it
to
be
reached
by
the
path
of
pure
psychology
as
cassina
supposed
the
key
can
be
furnished
by
metaphysics
alone
and
this
i
shall
attempt
to
give
in
the
last
part
of
the
present
treatise
i
now
turn
to
consider
the
derivation
of
actions
of
real
moral
worth
from
the
source
which
has
been
indicated
the
general
rule
by
which
to
test
such
conduct
and
which
consequently
is
the
leading
principle
of
ethics
i
have
already
enlarged
upon
in
the
foregoing
part
and
enunciated
as
follows
laede
immo
omnes
quantum
potes
do
harm
to
no
one
but
rather
help
all
people
as
far
as
lies
in
your
power
as
this
formula
contains
two
clauses
so
the
actions
corresponding
to
it
fall
naturally
into
two
classes
first
maxim
it
is
not
in
our
hearts
to
identify
ourselves
with
those
who
are
happier
than
we
are
but
only
with
those
who
are
less

the
virtue
of
justice
if
we
look
more
closely
at
this
process
called
compassion
which
we
have
shown
to
be
the
primary
ethical
phaenomenon
we
remark
at
once
that
there
are
two
distinct
degrees
in
which
another
suffering
may
become
directly
my
motive
that
is
may
urge
me
to
do
something
or
to
leave
it
undone
the
first
degree
of
compassion
is
seen
when
by
egoistic
and
malicious
motives
it
keeps
me
from
bringing
pain
on
another
and
from
becoming
myself
the
cause
of
trouble
which
so
far
does
not
exist
the
other
higher
degree
is
manifested
when
it
works
positively
and
incites
me
to
active
help
the
distinction
between
the
duties
of
law
and
duties
of
virtue
better
described
as
justice
and
which
was
effected
by
kant
in
such
a
forced
and
artificial
manner
here
results
entirely
of
itself
whence
the
correctness
of
the
principle
is
attested
it
is
the
natural
unmistakable
and
sharp
separation
between
negative
and
positive
between
doing
no
harm
and
helping
the
terms
in
common
use
namely
the
duties
of
law
and
the
duties
of
virtue
the
latter
being
also
called
duties
of
love
or
imperfect
duties
are
in
the
first
place
faulty
because
they
the
with
the
for
justice
is
one
of
the
virtues
and
next
they
owe
their
origin
to
the
mistake
of
giving
a
much
too
wide
extension
to
the
idea
duty
which
i
shall
reduce
to
its
proper
limits
below
in
place
therefore
of
these
duties
i
put
two
virtues
the
one
justice
and
the
other
and
i
name
them
cardinal
virtues
since
from
them
all
others
not
only
in
fact
proceed
but
also
may
be
theoretically
derived
both
have
their
root
in
natural
compassion
and
this
compassion
is
an
undeniable
fact
of
human
consciousness
is
an
essential
part
of
it
and
does
not
depend
on
assumptions
conceptions
religions
dogmas
myths
training
and
education
on
the
contrary
it
is
original
and
immediate
and
lies
in
human
nature
itself
it
consequently
remains
unchanged
under
all
circumstances
and
reveals
itself
in
every
land
and
at
all
times
this
is
why
appeal
is
everywhere
confidently
made
to
it
as
to
something
necessarily
present
in
every
man
and
it
is
never
an
attribute
of
the
strange
gods
as
he
who
appears
to
be
without
compassion
is
called
inhuman
so
humanity
is
often
used
as
its
synonyme
the
first
degree
then
in
which
this
natural
and
genuine
moral
incentive
shows
itself
is
only
originally
we
are
all
disposed
to
injustice
and
violence
because
our
need
our
desire
our
anger
and
hate
pass
into
the
consciousness
directly
and
hence
have
the
primi
the
right
of
the
first
occupant
whereas
the
sufferings
of
others
caused
by
our
injustice
and
violence
enter
the
consciousness
indirectly
that
is
by
the
secondary
channel
of
a
mental
picture
and
not
till
they
are
understood
by
experience
thus
seneca
says
neminem
ante
bona
mens
venit
quam
good
feelings
never
come
before
bad
ones
in
its
first
degree
therefore
compassion
opposes
and
baffles
the
design
to
which
i
am
urged
by
the
antimoral
forces
dwelling
within
me
and
which
will
bring
trouble
on
a
it
calls
out
to
me
stop
and
encircles
the
other
as
with
a
fence
so
as
to
protect
him
from
the
injury
which
otherwise
my
egoism
or
malice
would
lead
me
to
inflict
on
him
so
arises
out
of
this
first
degree
of
compassion
the
rule
do
harm
to
no
one
this
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
virtue
of
justice
and
here
alone
is
to
be
found
its
origin
pure
and
simple
an
origin
which
is
truly
moral
and
free
from
all
extraneous
admixture
otherwise
derived
justice
would
have
to
rest
on
egoism
a
ad
if
my
nature
is
susceptible
of
compassion
up
to
this
point
then
it
will
avail
to
keep
me
back
whenever
i
should
like
to
use
others
pain
as
a
means
to
obtain
my
ends
equally
whether
this
pain
be
immediate
or
an
whether
it
be
effected
directly
or
indirectly
through
intermediate
links
i
shall
therefore
lay
hands
on
the
property
as
little
as
on
the
person
of
another
and
avoid
causing
him
distress
no
less
mental
than
bodily
i
shall
thus
not
only
abstain
from
doing
him
physical
injury
but
also
with
equal
care
i
shall
guard
against
inflicting
on
him
the
suffering
of
mind
which
mortification
and
calumny
anxiety
and
vexation
so
surely
work
the
same
sense
of
compassion
will
check
me
from
gratifying
my
desires
at
the
cost
of
women
happiness
for
life
or
from
seducing
another
man
wife
or
from
ruining
youths
morally
and
physically
by
tempting
them
to
not
that
it
is
at
all
necessary
in
each
single
case
that
compassion
should
be
definitely
excited
indeed
it
would
often
come
too
late
but
rather
the
rule
is
formed
by
noble
minds
out
of
the
knowledge
gained
once
for
all
of
the
injury
which
every
unjust
act
necessarily
entails
upon
others
and
which
is
aggravated
by
the
feeling
of
having
to
endure
wrong
through
a
such
natures
are
led
by
reflecting
reason
to
carry
out
this
principle
with
unswerving
resolution
they
respect
the
rights
of
every
man
and
abstain
from
all
encroachment
on
them
they
keep
themselves
free
from
by
refusing
to
be
the
cause
of
trouble
they
do
not
shift
on
to
shoulders
not
their
own
by
force
or
by
trickery
the
burdens
and
sorrows
of
life
which
circumstances
bring
to
every
one
they
prefer
to
bear
themselves
the
portions
allotted
to
them
so
as
not
to
double
those
of
their
neighbours
for
although
generalising
formulae
and
abstract
knowledge
of
whatever
kind
are
not
in
the
least
the
cause
or
the
real
basis
of
morality
these
are
nevertheless
indispensable
for
a
moral
course
of
life
they
are
the
cistern
or
reservoir
in
which
the
habit
of
mind
that
springs
from
the
fount
of
all
morality
a
fount
not
at
all
moments
flowing
may
be
stored
up
thence
to
be
drawn
off
as
occasion
requires
there
is
thus
an
analogy
between
things
moral
and
things
physiological
among
many
instances
of
which
we
need
only
mention
that
of
the
which
is
used
for
keeping
the
secretion
of
the
liver
without
firmly
held
principles
we
should
inevitably
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
antimoral
incentives
directly
they
are
roused
to
activity
by
external
influences
and
lies
precisely
in
steadfast
adherence
and
obedience
to
such
principles
despite
the
motives
which
oppose
them
in
general
the
feminine
half
of
humanity
is
inferior
to
the
masculine
in
the
virtue
of
justice
and
its
derivatives
uprightness
conscientiousness
etc
the
explanation
is
found
in
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
weakness
of
its
reasoning
powers
the
former
is
much
less
capable
than
the
latter
of
understanding
and
holding
to
general
laws
and
of
taking
them
as
a
guiding
thread
hence
injustice
and
falseness
are
women
besetting
sins
and
lies
their
proper
element
on
the
other
hand
they
surpass
men
in
the
virtue
of
because
usually
the
stimulus
to
this
is
and
consequently
appeals
directly
to
the
sense
of
compassion
of
which
females
are
much
more
susceptible
than
males
for
the
former
nothing
but
what
is
intuitive
present
and
immediately
real
has
a
true
existence
that
which
is
knowable
only
by
means
of
concepts
as
for
instance
the
absent
the
distant
the
past
the
future
they
do
not
readily
grasp
we
thus
find
compensation
here
as
in
so
much
else
justice
is
more
the
masculine
more
the
feminine
virtue
the
mere
idea
of
seeing
women
sitting
on
the
judges
bench
raises
a
smile
but
the
sisters
of
mercy
far
excel
the
brothers
of
charity
now
animals
as
they
have
no
power
of
gaining
knowledge
by
reason
that
is
of
forming
abstract
ideas
are
entirely
incapable
of
fixed
resolutions
to
say
nothing
of
principles
they
consequently
totally
lack
and
are
helplessly
given
over
to
external
impressions
and
internal
impulses
this
is
why
they
have
no
conscious
morality
although
the
different
species
show
great
contrasts
of
good
and
evil
in
their
characters
and
as
regards
the
highest
races
these
are
traceable
even
in
individuals
from
the
foregoing
considerations
we
see
that
in
the
single
acts
of
the
just
man
compassion
works
only
indirectly
through
his
formulated
principles
and
not
so
much
as
much
in
the
same
way
as
in
statics
the
greater
length
of
one
of
the
owing
to
its
greater
power
of
motion
balances
the
smaller
weight
attached
to
it
with
the
larger
on
the
other
side
and
works
while
at
rest
only
not
yet
with
the
same
efficiency
nevertheless
compassion
is
always
ready
to
pass
into
active
operation
therefore
whenever
in
special
cases
the
established
rule
shows
signs
of
breaking
down
the
one
incentive
for
we
exclude
of
course
those
based
on
egoism
which
is
capable
of
infusing
fresh
life
into
it
is
that
drawn
from
the
itself
compassion
this
is
true
not
only
where
it
is
a
question
of
personal
violence
but
also
where
property
is
concerned
for
instance
when
any
one
feels
the
desire
to
keep
some
valuable
object
which
he
has
found
in
such
cases
if
we
set
aside
all
motives
prompted
by
worldly
wisdom
and
by
religion
nothing
brings
a
man
back
so
easily
to
the
path
of
justice
as
the
realisation
of
the
trouble
the
grief
the
lamentation
of
the
loser
it
is
because
this
is
felt
to
be
true
that
when
publicity
is
given
to
the
loss
of
money
the
assurance
is
so
often
added
that
the
loser
is
a
poor
man
a
servant
etc
it
is
hoped
that
these
considerations
have
made
it
clear
that
however
contrary
appearances
may
be
at
first
sight
yet
undoubtedly
justice
as
a
genuine
and
voluntary
virtue
has
its
origin
in
compassion
but
if
any
one
should
suppose
such
a
soil
too
barren
and
meagre
to
bear
this
great
cardinal
virtue
let
him
reflect
on
what
is
said
above
and
remember
how
small
is
the
amount
of
true
spontaneous
unselfish
unfeigned
justice
among
men
how
the
real
thing
only
occurs
as
a
surprising
exception
and
how
to
its
counterfeit
the
justice
that
rests
on
mere
worldly
wisdom
and
is
everywhere
published
abroad
it
is
related
both
in
quality
and
quantity
as
gold
is
to
copper
i
should
like
to
call
the
one
common
ordinary
justice
the
other
heavenly
justice
for
the
latter
is
she
who
according
to
hesiod
leaves
the
earth
in
the
iron
age
to
dwell
with
the
celestial
gods
to
produce
such
a
rare
exotic
as
this
the
root
we
have
indicated
is
surely
vigorous
enough
it
will
now
be
seen
that
or
always
consists
in
on
another
therefore
the
conception
of
wrong
is
and
antecedent
to
the
conception
of
right
which
is
and
simply
denotes
the
actions
performable
without
injury
to
others
in
other
words
without
wrong
being
done
that
to
this
class
belongs
also
whatever
is
effected
with
no
other
object
than
that
of
warding
off
from
oneself
meditated
mischief
is
an
easy
inference
for
no
participation
in
another
interests
and
no
sympathy
for
him
can
require
me
to
let
myself
be
harmed
by
him
that
is
to
undergo
wrong
the
theory
that
right
is
negative
in
contradistinction
to
wrong
as
positive
we
find
supported
by
hugo
grotius
the
father
of
philosophical
jurisprudence
the
definition
of
justice
which
he
gives
at
the
beginning
of
his
work
jure
belli
et
bk
chap
runs
as
follows
hic
nihil
aliud
quam
quod
justum
est
significant
idque
negante
magis
sensu
quam
aiente
ut
jus
sit
quod
injustum
non
the
negative
character
of
justice
is
also
established
little
as
it
may
appear
even
by
the
familiar
formula
give
to
each
one
his
own
now
there
is
no
need
to
give
a
man
his
own
if
he
has
it
the
real
meaning
is
therefore
take
from
none
his
own
since
the
requirements
of
justice
are
only
negative
they
may
be
effected
by
coercion
for
the
can
be
practised
by
all
alike
the
coercive
apparatus
is
the
state
whose
sole
is
to
protect
its
subjects
individually
from
each
other
and
collectively
from
external
foes
it
is
true
that
a
few
german
philosophers
of
this
venal
age
wish
to
distort
the
state
into
an
institution
for
the
spread
of
morality
education
and
edifying
instruction
but
such
a
view
contains
lurking
in
the
background
the
jesuitical
aim
of
doing
away
with
personal
freedom
and
individual
development
and
of
making
men
mere
wheels
in
a
huge
chinese
governmental
and
religious
machine
and
this
is
the
road
that
once
led
to
inquisitions
to
and
religious
wars
frederick
the
great
showed
that
he
at
least
never
wished
to
tread
it
when
he
said
in
my
land
every
one
shall
care
for
his
own
salvation
as
he
himself
thinks
best
nevertheless
we
still
see
everywhere
with
the
more
apparent
than
real
exception
of
north
america
that
the
state
undertakes
to
provide
for
the
metaphysical
needs
of
its
members
the
governments
appear
to
have
adopted
as
their
guiding
principle
the
tenet
of
quintus
curtius
res
efficacius
multitudinem
regit
quam
superstitio
alioquin
impotens
saeva
mutabilis
ubi
vana
religione
capta
est
melius
vatibus
quam
ducibus
suis
we
have
seen
that
wrong
and
right
are
convertible
synonymes
of
to
do
harm
and
to
refrain
from
doing
it
and
that
under
right
is
included
the
warding
off
of
injury
from
oneself
it
will
be
obvious
that
these
conceptions
are
independent
of
and
antecedent
to
all
positive
legislation
there
is
therefore
a
pure
ethical
right
or
natural
right
and
a
pure
doctrine
of
right
detached
from
all
positive
statutes
the
first
principles
of
this
doctrine
have
no
doubt
an
empirical
origin
so
far
as
they
arise
from
the
idea
of
harm
done
but
they
rest
on
the
pure
understanding
which
furnishes
ready
to
hand
the
axiom
causae
est
causa
the
cause
of
a
cause
is
the
cause
of
the
effect
taken
in
this
connection
the
words
mean
if
any
one
desires
to
injure
me
it
is
not
i
but
he
that
is
the
cause
of
whatever
i
am
obliged
to
do
in
and
i
can
consequently
oppose
all
encroachments
on
his
part
without
wronging
him
here
we
have
so
to
say
a
law
of
moral
repercussion
thus
it
comes
about
that
the
union
of
the
empirical
idea
of
injury
done
with
the
axiom
supplied
by
the
pure
understanding
gives
rise
to
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
wrong
and
right
which
every
one
grasps
and
learns
by
actual
trial
to
immediately
adopt
the
empiric
who
denies
this
and
refuses
to
accept
anything
but
the
verdict
of
experience
may
be
referred
to
the
testimony
of
the
savage
races
who
all
distinguish
between
wrong
and
right
quite
correctly
often
indeed
with
nice
precision
as
is
strikingly
manifested
when
they
are
engaged
in
bartering
and
other
transactions
with
europeans
or
visit
their
ships
they
are
bold
and
when
they
are
in
the
right
but
uneasy
when
they
know
they
are
wrong
in
disputes
a
just
settlement
satisfies
them
whereas
unjust
procedure
drives
them
to
war
the
doctrine
of
eight
is
a
branch
of
ethics
whose
function
is
to
determine
those
actions
which
may
not
be
performed
unless
one
wishes
to
injure
others
that
is
to
be
guilty
of
and
here
the
part
played
is
kept
in
view
but
legislation
applies
this
chapter
of
moral
science
conversely
that
is
with
reference
to
the
side
of
the
question
and
declares
that
the
same
actions
need
not
be
endured
since
no
one
ought
to
have
wrong
inflicted
on
him
to
frustrate
such
conduct
the
state
constructs
the
complete
edifice
of
the
law
as
positive
right
its
intention
is
that
no
one
shall
wrong
the
intention
of
the
doctrine
of
moral
right
is
that
no
one
shall
wrong
if
by
unjust
action
i
molest
some
one
whether
in
his
person
his
freedom
his
property
or
his
honour
the
wrong
as
regards
remains
the
same
but
with
respect
to
it
may
vary
very
much
this
difference
in
the
amount
of
wrong
effected
appears
not
to
have
been
as
yet
investigated
by
moralists
although
it
is
everywhere
recognised
in
real
life
because
the
censure
passed
is
always
proportional
to
the
harm
inflicted
so
also
with
just
actions
the
right
done
is
constant
in
quality
but
not
in
quantity
to
explain
this
better
he
who
when
dying
of
starvation
steals
a
loaf
commits
a
wrong
but
how
small
is
this
wrong
in
comparison
with
the
act
of
an
opulent
proprietor
who
in
whatever
way
despoils
a
poor
man
of
his
last
penny
again
the
rich
person
who
pays
his
hired
labourer
acts
justly
but
how
insignificant
is
this
piece
of
justice
when
contrasted
with
that
of
a
penniless
toiler
who
voluntarily
returns
to
its
wealthy
owner
a
purse
of
gold
which
he
has
found
the
measure
however
of
this
striking
difference
in
the
quantity
of
justice
and
injustice
the
being
always
constant
is
not
direct
and
absolute
as
on
a
graduated
scale
it
is
indirect
and
relative
like
the
ratio
of
sines
and
tangents
i
give
therefore
the
following
definition
the
amount
of
injustice
in
my
conduct
varies
as
the
amount
of
evil
which
i
thereby
bring
on
another
divided
by
the
amount
of
advantage
which
i
myself
gain
and
the
amount
of
justice
in
my
conduct
varies
as
the
amount
of
advantage
which
injury
done
to
another
brings
me
divided
by
the
amount
of
harm
which
he
thereby
suffers
we
have
further
to
notice
a
form
of
injustice
which
is
specifically
different
from
the
simple
kind
be
it
never
so
great
this
variety
may
be
detected
by
the
fact
that
the
amount
of
indignation
shown
by
disinterested
witnesses
which
is
always
proportional
to
the
amount
of
wrong
inflicted
never
reaches
the
except
when
it
is
present
we
then
see
how
the
deed
is
loathed
as
something
revolting
and
heinous
as
an
abomination
before
which
as
it
were
the
gods
veil
their
faces
injustice
occurs
when
some
one
after
definitely
undertaking
the
obligation
of
protecting
his
friend
master
client
in
a
special
way
not
only
is
guilty
of
of
that
duty
which
of
itself
would
be
injurious
to
the
other
and
therefore
a
wrong
but
when
in
addition
he
turns
round
and
attacks
the
man
and
strikes
at
the
very
spot
which
he
promised
to
guard
instances
are
the
appointed
watch
or
guide
who
becomes
an
assassin
the
trusted
caretaker
who
becomes
a
thief
the
guardian
who
robs
his
ward
of
her
property
the
lawyer
who
prevaricates
the
judge
who
is
corruptible
the
adviser
who
deliberately
gives
some
fatal
counsel
all
such
conduct
is
known
by
the
name
of
and
is
viewed
with
abhorrence
by
the
whole
world
hence
dante
puts
traitors
in
the
lowest
circle
of
hell
where
satan
himself
is
found
xi
as
we
have
here
had
occasion
to
mention
the
word
obligation
this
is
the
place
to
determine
the
conception
of
which
is
so
often
spoken
of
both
in
ethics
and
in
real
life
but
with
too
wide
an
extension
of
meaning
we
have
seen
that
wrong
always
signifies
injury
done
to
another
whether
it
be
in
his
person
his
freedom
his
property
or
his
honour
the
consequence
appears
to
be
that
every
wrong
must
imply
a
positive
aggression
and
so
a
definite
act
only
there
are
actions
the
simple
omission
of
which
constitutes
a
wrong
and
these
are
duties
this
is
the
true
philosophic
definition
of
the
conception
duty
a
term
which
loses
its
characteristic
note
and
hence
becomes
valueless
if
it
is
used
as
hitherto
it
has
been
in
moral
science
to
designate
all
praiseworthy
conduct
it
is
forgotten
that
duty
necessarily
means
a
which
is
owing
being
thus
an
action
by
the
simple
omission
of
which
another
suffers
harm
that
is
a
wrong
comes
about
clearly
in
this
case
the
injury
only
takes
place
through
the
person
who
neglects
the
duty
having
distinctly
pledged
or
bound
himself
to
it
consequently
all
duties
depend
on
an
obligation
which
has
been
entered
into
this
as
a
rule
takes
the
form
of
a
definite
if
sometimes
tacit
agreement
between
two
parties
as
for
instance
between
prince
and
people
government
and
its
servants
master
and
man
lawyer
and
client
physician
and
patient
in
a
word
between
any
and
every
one
who
undertakes
to
perform
some
task
and
his
employer
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
hence
every
duty
involves
a
right
since
no
one
undertakes
an
obligation
without
a
motive
which
means
in
this
case
without
seeing
some
advantage
for
himself
there
is
only
obligation
that
i
know
of
which
is
not
subject
to
an
agreement
but
arises
directly
and
solely
through
an
act
this
is
because
one
of
the
persons
with
whom
it
has
to
do
was
not
in
existence
when
it
was
contracted
i
refer
to
the
duty
of
parents
towards
their
children
whoever
brings
a
child
into
the
world
has
incumbent
on
him
the
duty
of
supporting
his
offspring
until
the
latter
is
able
to
maintain
himself
and
should
this
time
never
come
owing
to
incapacity
from
blindness
deformity
cretinism
and
the
like
neither
does
the
duty
ever
come
to
an
end
it
is
clear
that
merely
by
failing
to
provide
for
the
needs
of
his
son
that
is
by
a
simple
omission
the
father
would
injure
him
indeed
jeopardise
his
life
children
duty
towards
their
parents
is
not
so
direct
and
imperative
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
as
every
duty
involves
a
right
parents
also
must
have
some
just
claim
on
their
issue
this
is
the
foundation
of
the
duty
of
filial
obedience
which
however
in
course
of
time
ceases
simultaneously
with
the
right
out
of
which
it
sprang
it
is
replaced
by
gratitude
for
that
which
was
done
by
father
and
mother
over
and
above
their
strict
duty
nevertheless
although
ingratitude
is
a
hateful
often
indeed
a
revolting
vice
gratitude
can
not
be
called
a
because
its
omission
inflicts
no
injury
on
the
other
side
and
is
therefore
no
otherwise
we
should
have
to
suppose
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
the
benefactor
aims
at
making
a
good
bargain
it
should
be
noticed
that
reparation
made
for
harm
done
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
duty
arising
directly
through
an
action
this
however
is
something
purely
negative
as
it
is
nothing
but
an
attempt
to
remove
and
blot
out
the
consequences
of
an
unjust
deed
as
a
thing
that
ought
never
to
have
taken
place
be
it
also
observed
that
equity
is
the
foe
of
justice
and
often
comes
into
harsh
collision
with
it
so
that
the
former
ought
only
to
be
admitted
within
certain
limits
the
german
is
a
friend
of
equity
while
the
englishman
holds
to
justice
the
law
of
motivation
is
just
as
strict
as
that
of
physical
causality
and
hence
involves
the
same
irresistible
necessity
consequently
wrong
may
be
compassed
not
only
by
violence
but
also
by
cunning
if
by
violence
i
am
able
to
kill
or
rob
another
or
compel
him
to
obey
me
i
can
equally
use
cunning
to
accomplish
the
same
ends
that
is
i
can
place
false
motives
before
his
intellect
by
reason
of
which
he
must
do
what
otherwise
he
would
not
these
false
motives
are
effected
by
lies
in
reality
lies
are
unjustifiable
solely
in
so
far
as
they
are
instruments
of
cunning
in
other
words
of
compulsion
by
means
of
motivation
and
this
is
precisely
their
function
as
a
rule
for
in
the
first
place
i
can
not
tell
a
falsehood
without
a
motive
and
this
motive
will
certainly
be
with
the
rarest
exceptions
an
unjust
one
namely
the
intention
of
holding
others
over
whom
i
have
no
power
under
my
will
that
is
of
coercing
them
through
the
agency
of
motivation
also
in
mere
exaggerations
and
untruthful
bombast
there
is
the
same
purpose
at
work
for
by
employing
such
language
a
man
tries
to
place
himself
higher
in
the
sight
of
others
than
is
his
due
the
binding
force
of
a
promise
or
a
compact
is
contained
in
the
fact
that
if
it
be
not
observed
it
is
a
deliberate
lie
pronounced
in
the
most
solemn
manner
a
lie
whose
intention
that
of
putting
others
under
moral
compulsion
is
in
this
case
all
the
clearer
because
its
motive
the
desired
performance
of
something
on
the
other
side
is
expressly
declared
the
contemptible
part
of
the
fraud
is
that
hypocrisy
is
used
to
disarm
the
victim
before
he
is
attacked
the
highest
point
of
villainy
is
reached
in
which
as
we
have
seen
is
a
injustice
and
is
always
regarded
with
loathing
it
is
then
obvious
that
just
as
i
am
not
wrong
that
is
right
in
resisting
violence
by
violence
so
where
violence
is
not
feasible
or
it
appears
more
convenient
i
am
at
liberty
to
resort
to
cunning
accordingly
whenever
i
am
entitled
to
use
force
i
may
if
i
please
employ
falsehood
for
instance
against
robbers
and
miscreants
of
every
sort
whom
in
this
way
i
entice
into
a
trap
hence
a
promise
which
is
extorted
by
violence
is
not
binding
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
right
to
avail
myself
of
lies
extends
further
it
occurs
whenever
an
unjustifiable
question
is
asked
which
has
to
do
with
my
private
or
business
affairs
and
is
hence
prompted
by
curiosity
for
to
answer
it
or
even
to
put
it
off
by
the
words
i
ca
tell
you
would
expose
me
to
danger
here
an
untruth
is
the
indispensable
weapon
against
unwarranted
inquisitiveness
whose
motive
is
hardly
ever
a
one
for
just
as
i
have
the
right
to
oppose
the
apparent
bad
will
of
another
and
to
anticipate
with
physical
resistance
to
the
danger
of
my
aggressor
the
physical
violence
presumably
thence
resulting
so
that
for
instance
as
a
precaution
i
can
protect
my
garden
wall
with
sharp
spikes
let
loose
savage
dogs
in
my
court
at
night
and
even
if
circumstances
require
it
set
and
for
the
evil
consequences
of
which
the
burglar
has
only
himself
to
thank
if
i
have
the
right
to
do
this
then
i
am
equally
authorised
in
keeping
secret
at
any
price
that
which
if
known
would
lay
me
bare
to
the
attack
of
others
and
i
have
good
reason
for
acting
thus
because
in
moral
no
less
than
in
physical
relations
i
am
driven
to
assume
that
the
bad
will
of
others
is
very
possible
and
must
therefore
take
all
necessary
preventive
measures
beforehand

the

of

as
the
deepest
insult

who
on

are

truthful
than

all
unjustifiable
questions
having

affairs
are
looked
upon
as
a
piece
of
which
is
denoted
by
the
expression
to
ask
questions
certainly
every
sensible
person
even
when
he
is
of
the
strictest
rectitude
follows
the
principle
above
set
forth
suppose
for
instance
such
a
one
is
returning
from
a
remote
spot
where
he
has
raised
a
sum
of
money
and
suppose
an
unknown
traveller
joins
him
and
after
the
customary
whither
and
whence
gradually
proceeds
to
inquire
what
may
have
taken
him
to
that
place
the
former
will
undoubtedly
give
a
false
answer
in
order
to
avoid
the
danger
of
robbery
again
if
a
man
be
found
in
the
house
of
another
whose
daughter
he
is
wooing
and
he
is
asked
the
cause
of
his
unexpected
presence
unless
he
has
entirely
lost
his
head
he
will
not
give
the
true
reason
but
unhesitatingly
invent
a
pretext
and
the
cases
are
numberless
in
which
every
reasonable
being
tells
an
untruth
without
the
least
scruple
of
conscience
it
is
this
view
of
the
matter
alone
that
removes
the
crying
contradiction
between
the
morality
which
is
taught
and
that
which
is
daily
practised
even
by
the
best
and
most
upright
of
men
at
the
same
time
the
restriction
of
a
falsehood
to
the
single
purpose
of
must
be
rigidly
observed
for
otherwise
this
doctrine
would
admit
of
terrible
abuse
a
lie
being
in
itself
a
very
dangerous
instrument
but
just
as
even
in
time
of
public
peace
the
law
allows
every
one
to
carry
weapons
and
to
use
them
when
required
for
so
ethics
permits
lies
to
be
employed
for
the
same
purpose
and
be
it
observed
for
this
one
purpose
only
every
mendacious
word
is
a
wrong
excepting
only
when
the
occasion
arises
of
defending
oneself
against
violence
or
cunning
hence
justice
requires
truthfulness
towards
all
men
but
the
entirely
unconditional
and
unreserved
condemnation
of
lies
as
properly
involved
in
their
nature
is
sufficiently
refuted
by
well
known
facts
thus
there
are
cases
where
a
falsehood
is
a
especially
for
doctors
and
there
are
lies
as
for
instance
that
of
the
marquis
posa
in
or
that
in
the

occur
indeed
whenever
a
man
wills
to

and

to

to
prejudice
in
the
chapter
of
his
dealing

he
loads
them
with
every
kind
of
defamatory
epithet
but
does
not
adduce
a
single
adequate
reason
for
their
condemnation
which
would
have
been
more
to
the
point
declamation
is
easier
than
demonstration
and

moralise

difficult
than
to
be

would
have
done
better
to
open
the
vials
of
his
wrath
on
that
vice
which
takes
pleasure
in
seeing
others
suffer
it
is
the
latter
and
not
a
falsehood
which
is
truly
fiendish
for
malignant
joy
is
the
exact
opposite
of
compassion
and
nothing
else
but
powerless
cruelty
which
unable
itself
to
bring
about
the
misery
it
so
gladly
beholds
others
enduring
is
thankful
to
for
having
done
so
instead
according
to
the
code
of
knightly
honour
the
reproach
of
being
a
liar
is
of
extreme
gravity
and
only
to
be
washed
out
with
the
accuser
blood
now
this
obtains
not
because
the
lie
is
wrong
in
itself
since
were
such
the
reason
to
accuse
a
man
of
an
injury
done
by
violence
would
certainly
be
regarded
as
equally
outrageous
which
is
not
the
case
as
every
one
knows
but
it
is
due
to
that
principle
of
chivalry
which
in
reality
bases
right
on
might
so
that
whoever
when
trying
to
work
mischief
has
recourse
to
falsehood
proves
that
he
lacks
either
power
or
the
requisite
courage
every
untruth
bears
witness
of
his
fear
and
this
is

it
is
true
that
has
existed
at
all
times
in
practice
and
in
fact
but
it
was
reserved
for
christianity
whose
greatest
service
is
seen
in
this
to
theoretically
formulate
and
expressly
advance
it
not
only
as
a
virtue
but
as
the
queen
of
all
and
to
extend
it
even
to
enemies
we
are
thinking
of
course
only
of
europe
for
in
asia
a
thousand
years
before
the
boundless
love
of
one
neighbour
had
been
prescribed
and
taught
as
well
as
practised
the
vedas
are
full
of
it
while
in
the
itihāsa
and
purāna
it
constantly
recurs
to
say
nothing
of
the
preaching
of
the
buddha
and
to
be
quite
accurate
we
must
admit
that
there
are
traces
to
be
found
among
the
greeks
and
romans
of
a
recommendation
to
follow
for
instance
in
cicero
and
also
in
pythagoras
according
to
iamblichus
vita
chap
my
task
is
now
to
give
a
philosophical
derivation
of
this
virtue
from
the
principle
i
have
laid
down
it
has
been
demonstrated
in
chapter
of
this
part
that
the
sense
of
compassion
however
much
its
origin
is
shrouded
in
mystery
is
the
one
and
sole
cause
whereby
the
suffering
i
see
in
another
of
itself
and
as
such
becomes
directly
my
motive
and
we
have
seen
that
the
first
stage
of
this
process
is
the
second
degree
is
sharply
distinguished
from
the
first
through
the
character
of
the
actions
resulting
therefrom
for
at
this
point
compassion
does
more
than
keep
me
back
from
injuring
my
neighbour
it
impels
me
to
help
him
and
according
as
on
the
one
hand
my
sense
of
direct
participation
is
keen
and
deep
and
on
the
other
hand
the
distress
is
great
and
urgent
so
shall
i
be
constrained
by
this
motive
which
be
it
noted
is
purely
and
wholly
moral
to
make
a
greater
or
less
sacrifice
in
order
to
meet
the
need
or
the
calamity
which
i
observe
and
this
sacrifice
may
involve
the
expenditure
of
my
bodily
or
mental
powers
the
loss
of
my
property
freedom
or
even
life
so
that
in
this
direct
another
which
rests
on
no
arguments
and
requires
none
is
found
the
one
simple
origin
of
in
other
words
that
virtue
whose
rule
is
quantum
potes
help
all
people
as
far
as
lies
in
your
power
and
from
which
all
those
actions
proceed
which
are
prescribed
by
ethics
under
the
name
of
duties
of
virtue
otherwise
called
duties
of
love
or
imperfect
duties
it
is
solely
by
direct
and
as
it
were
instinctive
participation
in
the
sufferings
which
we
see
in
other
words
by
compassion
that
conduct
so
defined
is
occasioned
at
least
when
it
can
be
said
to
have
moral
worth
that
is
be
declared
free
from
all
egoistic
motives
and
when
on
that
account
it
awakens
in
us
that
inward
contentment
which
is
called
a
good
satisfied
approving
conscience
and
elicits
from
the
spectator
not
without
making
him
cast
a
humiliating
glance
at
himself
that
remarkable
commendation
respect
and
admiration
which
are
too
to
be
denied
but
if
a
beneficent
action
have
any
other
motive
whatever
then
it
must
be
egoistic
if
not
actually
malicious
for
as
the
fundamental
springs
of
all
human
conduct
chapter
of
this
part
are
three
namely
egoism
malice
compassion
so
the
various
motives
which
are
capable
of
affecting
men
may
be
grouped
under
three
general
heads
one
own
weal
others
woe
others
weal
now
if
the
motive
of
a
kind
act
does
not
belong
to
the
third
class
it
must
of
course
be
found
in
the
first
or
second
to
the
second
it
is
occasionally
to
be
ascribed
for
instance
if
i
do
good
to
some
one
in
order
to
vex
another
to
whom
i
am
hostile
or
to
make
the
latter
sufferings
more
acute
or
it
may
be
to
put
to
shame
a
third
person
who
refrained
from
helping
or
lastly
to
inflict
a
mortification
on
the
man
whom
i
benefit
but
it
much
more
usually
springs
from
the
first
class
and
this
is
the
case
whenever
in
doing
some
good
i
have
in
view
my
own
weal
no
matter
how
remote
or
indirect
it
may
be
that
is
whenever
i
am
influenced
by
the
thought
of
reward
whether
in
this
or
in
another
world
or
by
the
hope
of
winning
high
esteem
and
of
gaining
a
reputation
for
nobleness
of
character
or
again
when
i
reflect
that
the
person
whom
i
now
aid
may
one
day
be
able
to
assist
me
in
return
or
otherwise
be
of
some
service
and
benefit
or
when
lastly
i
am
guided
by
the
consideration
that
i
must
keep
the
rules
of
magnanimity
and
beneficence
because
i
too
may
on
some
occasion
profit
thereby
in
a
word
my
motive
is
egoistic
as
soon
as
it
is
anything
other
than
the
purely
objective
desire
of
simply
knowing
without
any
ulterior
purpose
that
my
neighbour
is
helped
delivered
from
his
distress
and
need
or
freed
from
his
suffering
if
such
an
aim
shorn
as
it
is
of
all
subjectivity
be
really
mine
then
and
then
only
have
i
given
proof
of
that
which
it
is
the
great
and
distinguishing
merit
of
christianity
to
have
preached
it
should
be
observed
in
this
connection
that
the
injunctions
which
the
gospel
adds
to
its
commandment
of
love
μὴ
γνώτω
ἡ
ἀρίστερα
σου
τί
ποιεῑ
ἡ
δεξιά
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth
and
the
like
are
in
point
of
fact
based
on
a
consciousness
of
the
conclusion
i
have
here
reached
namely
that
distress
of
itself
alone
without
any
further
consideration
must
be
my
motive
if
what
i
do
is
to
be
of
moral
value
and
in
the
same
place
vi
we
find
it
stated
with
perfect
truth
that
ostentations
almsgivers
τὸν
μισθὸν
get
in
full
exhaust
their
reward
although
in
this
respect
too
the
vedas
shed
on
us
the
light
of
a
higher
teaching
they
repeatedly
declare
that
he
who
desires
any
sort
of
recompense
for
his
work
is
still
wandering
in
the
path
of
darkness
and
not
yet
ripe
for
deliverance
if
any
one
should
ask
me
what
he
gets
from
a
charitable
act
my
answer
in
all
sincerity
would
be
this
that
the
lot
of
the
poor
man
you
relieve
is
just
so
much
the
lighter
otherwise
absolutely
nothing
if
you
are
not
satisfied
and
feel
that
such
is
not
a
sufficient
end
then
your
wish
was
not
to
give
alms
but
to
make
a
purchase
and
you
have
effected
a
bad
bargain
but
if
the
one
thing
you
are
concerned
with
is
that
he
should
feel
the
pressure
of
poverty
less
then
you
have
gained
your
object
you
have
diminished
his
suffering
and
you
see
exactly
how
far
your
gift
is
requited
now
how
is
it
possible
that
trouble
which
is
not
mine
and
by
which
i
am
untouched
should
become
as
direct
a
motive
to
me
as
if
it
were
my
own
and
incite
me
to
action
as
already
explained
only
through
the
fact
that
although
it
comes
before
me
merely
as
something
outside
myself
by
means
of
the
external
medium
of
sight
or
hearing
i
am
nevertheless
sensible
of
it
with
the
sufferer
i
feel
it
as
my
own
not
indeed
in
myself
but
in
him
and
so
what
calderon
said
comes
to
pass
entre
el
y
el
distancia
siempre
lo
peor
es
jorn
esc
this
however
presupposes
that
to
a
certain
extent
i
have
become
identified
with
the
other
and
consequently
that
the
barrier
between
the
ego
and
the
is
for
the
moment
broken
down
it
is
then
and
then
only
that
i
make
his
interests
his
need
his
distress
his
suffering
directly
my
own
it
is
then
that
the
empirical
picture
i
have
of
him
vanishes
and
i
no
longer
see
the
stranger
who
is
entirely
unlike
myself
and
to
whom
i
am
indifferent
but
i
share
his
pain
in
him
despite
the
certainty
that
his
skin
does
not
enclose
my
nerves
only
in
this
way
is
it
possible
for
woe
distress
to
become
a
motive
otherwise
i
should
be
influenced
solely
by
my
own
this
process
is
i
repeat
for
it
is
one
which
reason
can
give
no
direct
account
of
and
its
causes
lie
outside
the
field
of
experience
and
yet
it
is
of
daily
occurrence
every
one
has
often
felt
its
working
within
himself
even
to
the
most
and
selfish
it
is
not
unknown
each
day
that
passes
brings
it
before
our
eyes
in
single
acts
on
a
small
scale
whenever
a
man
by
direct
impulse
without
much
reflection
helps
a
and
comes
to
his
aid
sometimes
even
exposing
himself
to
the
most
imminent
peril
for
the
sake
of
one
he
has
never
seen
before
and
this
without
once
thinking
of
anything
but
the
fact
that
he
witnesses
great
distress
and
danger
it
was
manifested
on
a
large
scale
when
after
long
consideration
and
many
a
stormy
debate
the
british
nation
gave
twenty
millions
of
pounds
to
ransom
the
negroes
in
its
colonies
with
the
approbation
and
joy
of
a
whole
world
if
any
one
refuses
to
recognise
in
compassion
the
cause
of
this
deed
magnificent
as
it
is
in
its
grand
proportions
and
prefers
to
ascribe
it
to
christianity
let
him
remember
that
in
the
whole
of
the
new
testament
not
one
word
is
said
against
slavery
though
at
that
time
it
was
practically
universal
and
further
that
as
late
as
in
north
america
when
the
question
was
being
discussed
a
man
was
found
who
thought
to
strengthen
his
case
by
appealing
to
the
fact
that
abraham
and
jacob
kept
slaves
what
will
be
in
each
separate
case
the
practical
effect
of
this
mysterious
inner
process
may
be
left
to
ethics
to
analyse
in
chapters
and
paragraphs
entitled
duties
of
virtue
duties
of
love
imperfect
duties
or
whatever
other
name
be
used
the
root
the
basis
of
all
these
is
the
one
here
indicated
for
out
of
it
arises
the
primary
precept
quantum
potes
from
which
in
turn
everything
else
required
can
very
easily
be
deduced
just
as
out
of
the
the
first
half
of
my
principle
all
duties
of
justice
are
derivable
ethics
is
in
truth
the
easiest
of
all
sciences
and
this
is
only
to
be
expected
since
it
is
incumbent
on
each
person
to
construct
it
for
himself
and
himself
form
the
rule
for
every
case
as
it
occurs
out
of
the
fundamental
law
which
lies
deep
in
his
heart
for
few
have
leisure
and
patience
enough
to
learn
a
system
of
morals
from
justice
and
spring
all
the
other
virtues
for
which
reason
these
two
may
properly
be
called
cardinal
and
the
disclosure
of
their
origin
lays
the
of
moral
science
the
entire
ethical
content
of
the
old
testament
is
justice
being
that
of
the
new
the
latter
is
the
the
new
commandment
xiii
which
according
to
paul
xiii
includes
all
christian
virtues
plato
taught
that
justice
includes
in
itself
the
three
other
virtues
of
wisdom
σοϕία
fortitude
and
temperance
with
aristotle
too
justice
is
the
chief
of
virtues
while
the
stoic
doctrine
is
that
virtue
is
manifested
in
four
leading
forms
wisdom
justice
fortitude
and
there
are
four
vedas

this
chapter
describes
the
pythagorean
ϕίλια

which
comes
very
near
to
it
contains
also
certain
τῆς
ϕίλιας
for
between
the
view
of

and

itself

sc
chapter
viii
the
proof
now
given
confirmed
by
experience
the
truth
i
have
here
laid
down
that
compassion
is
the
sole
stimulus
and
therefore
the
only
really
moral
one
is
a
strange
indeed
almost
incomprehensible
paradox
i
shall
hope
therefore
to
render
it
less
extraordinary
to
the
reader
if
i
show
that
it
is
confirmed
by
experience
and
by
the
universal
testimony
of
human
sentiment
for
this
purpose
i
shall
in
the
first
place
state
an
imaginary
case
which
in
the
present
investigation
may
serve
as
an
a
crucial
test
but
not
to
make
the
matter
too
easy
i
shall
take
no
instance
of
but
rather
a
breach
of
lawful
right
and
that
of
the
worse
kind
let
us
suppose
two
young
people
caius
and
titus
to
be
passionately
in
love
each
with
a
different
girl
and
that
both
are
completely
thwarted
by
two
other
men
who
are
preferred
because
of
certain
external
circumstances
they
have
both
resolved
to
put
their
rivals
out
of
the
way
and
are
perfectly
secure
from
every
chance
of
detection
even
from
all
suspicion
but
when
they
come
to
actually
prepare
for
the
murder
each
of
them
after
an
inward
struggle
draws
back
they
are
now
to
give
us
a
truthful
and
clear
account
of
the
reasons
why
they
abandoned
their
project
as
for
caius
i
leave
it
entirely
to
the
reader
to
choose
what
motive
he
likes
it
may
be
that
religions
grounds
checked
him
for
instance
the
thought
of
the
divine
will
of
future
retribution
of
the
judgment
to
come
etc
or
perhaps
he
may
say
i
reflected
that
the
principle
i
was
going
to
apply
in
this
case
would
not
be
adapted
to
provide
a
rule
universally
valid
for
all
possible
rational
beings
because
i
should
have
treated
my
rival
only
as
a
means
and
not
at
the
same
time
as
an
end
or
following
fichte
he
may
deliver
himself
as
follows
every
human
life
is
a
means
towards
realising
the
moral
law
consequently
i
can
not
without
being
indifferent
to
this
realisation
destroy
a
being
ordained
to
do
his
part
in
effecting
it
p
this
scruple
be
it
observed
in
passing
he
might
well
overcome
by
the
hope
of
soon
producing
a
new
instrument
of
the
moral
law
when
once
in
possession
of
his
beloved
or
again
he
may
speak
after
the
fashion
of
wollaston
i
considered
that
such
an
action
would
be
the
expression
of
a
false
tenet
or
like
hutcheson
the
moral
sense
whose
perceptions
equally
with
those
of
every
other
sense
admit
of
no
final
explanation
forbade
me
to
commit
such
a
deed
or
like
adam
smith
i
foresaw
that
my
act
would
awaken
no
sympathy
with
me
in
the
minds
of
the
spectators
or
his
language
may
be
borrowed
from
christian
wolff
i
recognised
that
i
should
thereby
advance
neither
the
work
of
making
myself
perfect
nor
the
same
process
in
any
one
else
or
from
spinoza
nihil
utilius
homine
ergo
hominem
interimere
to
man
nothing
is
more
useful
than
man
therefore
i
was
unwilling
to
destroy
a
man
in
short
he
may
say
what
one
pleases
but
titus
whose
explanation
is
supplied
by
myself
will
speak
as
follows
when
i
came
to
make
arrangements
for
the
work
and
so
for
the
moment
had
to
occupy
myself
not
with
my
own
passion
but
with
my
rival
then
for
the
first
time
i
saw
clearly
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
but
simultaneously
i
was
seized
with
compassion
and
pity
sorrow
for
him
laid
hold
upon
me
and
overmastered
me
i
could
not
strike
the
blow
now
i
ask
every
honest
and
unprejudiced
reader
which
of
these
two
is
the
better
man
to
which
would
he
prefer
to
entrust
his
own
destiny
which
is
restrained
by
the
purer
motive
consequently
where
does
the
basis
of
morality
lie
there
is
nothing
that
revolts
our
moral
sense
so
much
as
cruelty
every
other
offence
we
can
pardon
but
not
cruelty
the
reason
is
found
in
the
fact
that
cruelty
is
the
exact
opposite
of
compassion
when
we
hear
of
intensely
cruel
conduct
as
for
instance
the
act
which
has
just
been
recorded
in
the
papers
of
a
mother
who
murdered
her
little
son
of
five
years
by
pouring
boiling
oil
into
his
throat
and
her
younger
child
by
burying
it
alive
or
what
was
recently
reported
from
algiers
how
a
casual
dispute
between
a
spaniard
and
an
algerine
ended
in
a
fight
and
how
the
latter
having
vanquished
the
other
tore
out
the
whole
of
his
lower
jaw
bone
and
carried
it
off
as
a
trophy
leaving
his
adversary
still
alive
when
we
hear
of
cruelty
like
this
we
are
seized
with
horror
and
exclaim
how
is
it
possible
to
do
such
a
thing
now
let
me
ask
what
this
question
signifies
does
it
mean
how
is
it
possible
to
fear
so
little
the
punishments
of
the
future
life
it
is
difficult
to
admit
this
interpretation
then
perhaps
it
intends
to
say
how
is
it
possible
to
act
according
to
a
principle
which
is
so
absolutely
unfitted
to
become
a
general
law
for
all
rational
beings
certainly
not
or
once
more
how
is
it
possible
to
neglect
so
utterly
one
own
perfection
as
well
as
that
of
another
this
is
equally
unimaginable
the
sense
of
the
question
is
assuredly
nothing
but
this
how
is
it
possible
to
be
so
utterly
bereft
of
compassion
the
conclusion
is
that
when
an
action
is
characterised
by
an
extraordinary
absence
of
compassion
it
bears
the
certain
stamp
of
the
deepest
depravity
and
loathsomeness
hence
compassion
is
the
true
moral
incentive
the
ethical
basis
or
the
original
moral
stimulus
which
i
have
disclosed
is
the
only
one
that
can
be
justly
said
to
have
a
real
and
extended
sphere
of
effective
influence
no
one
will
surely
venture
to
maintain
as
much
of
all
the
other
moral
principles
that
philosophers
have
set
up
for
these
are
composed
of
abstract
sometimes
even
of
propositions
with
no
foundation
other
than
an
artificial
combination
of
ideas
such
that
their
application
to
actual
conduct
would
often
incline
to
the
comic
a
good
action
inspired
solely
by
kant
moral
principle
would
be
at
bottom
the
work
of
philosophic
pedantry
or
else
would
lead
the
doer
into
through
his
reason
interpreting
conduct
which
had
other
perhaps
nobler
incentives
as
the
product
of
the
categorical
imperative
and
of
the
conception
of
duty
which
as
we
have
seen
rests
on
nothing
but
not
only
is
it
true
that
the
moral
principles
purely
theoretical
as
they
are
have
seldom
any
operative
power
of
those
established
by
and
expressly
framed
for
practical
purposes
it
is
equally
difficult
to
predicate
any
marked
efficiency
the
chief
evidence
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
the
great
religious
differences
in
the
world
the
amount
of
morality
or
rather
of
immorality
shows
no
corresponding
variation
but
in
essentials
is
pretty
much
the
same
everywhere
only
it
is
important
not
to
confound
rudeness
and
refinement
with
morality
and
immorality
the
religion
of
hellas
had
an
exceedingly
small
moral
tendency
it
hardly
went
further
than
respect
for
oaths
no
dogma
was
taught
and
no
system
of
ethics
publicly
preached
nevertheless
all
things
considered
it
does
not
appear
that
the
greeks
were
morally
inferior
to
the
men
of
the
christian
era
the
morality
of
christianity
is
of
a
much
higher
kind
than
that
of
any
other
religion
which
previously
appeared
in
europe
but
if
any
one
should
believe
for
this
reason
that
european
morals
have
improved
proportionally
and
that
now
at
any
rate
they
surpass
what
obtains
elsewhere
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
demonstrate
that
among
the
mohammedans
gnebres
hindus
and
buddhists
there
is
at
least
as
much
honesty
fidelity
toleration
gentleness
beneficence
nobleness
and
as
among
christian
peoples
indeed
the
scale
will
be
found
rather
to
turn
unfavourably
for
christendom
when
we
put
into
the
balance
the
long
list
of
inhuman
cruelties
which
have
constantly
been
perpetrated
within
its
limits
and
often
in
its
name
we
need
only
recall
for
a
moment
the
numerous
religious
wars
the
crusades
that
nothing
can
justify
the
extirpation
of
a
large
part
of
the
american
aborigines
and
the
peopling
of
that
continent
by
negroes
brought
over
from
africa
without
the
shadow
of
a
right
torn
from
their
families
their
country
their
hemisphere
and
as
slaves
condemned
for
life
to
forced
labour
the
tireless
persecution
of
heretics
the
unspeakable
atrocities
of
the
inquisition
that
cried
aloud
to
heaven
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
the
execution
of
persons
in
the
netherlands
by
the
duke
of
alva
and
these
are
but
a
few
facts
among
many
speaking
generally
however
if
we
compare
with
the
performances
of
its
followers
the
excellent
morality
which
christianity
and
more
or
less
every
creed
preaches
and
then
try
to
imagine
how
far
theory
would
become
practice
if
crime
were
not
impeded
by
the
secular
arm
of
the
state
nay
more
what
would
probably
happen
if
for
only
one
day
all
laws
should
be
suspended
we
shall
be
obliged
to
confess
that
the
effect
of
the
various
religions
on
morals
is
in
fact
very
small
this
is
of
course
due
to
weakness
of
faith
theoretically
and
so
long
as
it
is
only
a
question
of
piety
in
the
abstract
every
one
supposes
his
belief
to
be
firm
enough
only
the
searching
of
all
our
convictions
is
what
we
do
when
the
moment
for
acting
arrives
and
our
faith
has
to
be
tested
by
great
and
heavy
sacrifices
then
its
feebleness
becomes
evident
if
a
man
is
seriously
planning
some
evil
he
has
already
broken
the
bounds
of
true
and
pure
morality
thenceforward
the
chief
restraint
that
checks
him
is
invariably
the
dread
of
justice
and
the
police
should
he
be
so
hopeful
of
escaping
detection
as
to
cast
such
fears
aside
the
next
barrier
that
meets
him
is
regard
for
his
honour
if
this
second
rampart
be
crossed
there
is
very
little
likelihood
after
both
these
powerful
hindrances
are
withdrawn
that
any
religious
dogma
will
appeal
to
him
strongly
enough
to
keep
him
back
from
the
deed
for
if
he
be
not
frightened
by
near
and
immediate
dangers
he
will
hardly
be
curbed
by
terrors
which
are
distant
and
rest
merely
on
belief
moreover
there
is
a
positive
objection
that
may
be
brought
against
all
good
conduct
proceeding
solely
from
religions
conviction
it
is
not
purged
of
but
done
out
of
regard
for
reward
and
punishment
and
hence
can
have
no
purely
moral
value
this
view
we
find
very
clearly
expressed
in
a
letter
of
the
celebrated
of
weimar
karl
august
he
writes
baron
weyhers
was
himself
of
opinion
that
he
who
is
good
through
religion
and
not
by
natural
inclination
must
be
a
bad
fellow
at
heart
vino
veritas
letters
to
no
but
now
let
us
turn
to
the
moral
incentive
which
i
have
disclosed
who
ventures
for
a
moment
to
deny
that
it
displays
a
marked
and
truly
wonderful
influence
at
all
times
among
all
peoples
in
all
circumstances
of
life
even
when
constitutional
law
is
suspended
and
the
horrors
of
revolutions
and
wars
fill
the
air
in
small
things
and
in
great
every
day
and
every
hour
who
will
refuse
to
admit
that
it
is
constantly
preventing
much
wrong
and
calling
into
existence
many
a
good
action
often
quite
unexpectedly
and
where
there
is
no
hope
of
reward
is
there
any
one
who
will
gainsay
the
fact
that
where
it
and
it
alone
has
been
operative
we
all
with
deep
respect
and
emotion
unreservedly
recognise
the
presence
of
genuine
moral
worth
boundless
compassion
for
all
living
beings
is
the
surest
and
most
certain
guarantee
of
pure
moral
conduct
and
needs
no
casuistry
whoever
is
filled
with
it
will
assuredly
injure
no
one
do
harm
to
no
one
encroach
on
no
man
rights
he
will
rather
have
regard
for
every
one
forgive
every
one
help
every
one
as
far
as
he
can
and
all
his
actions
will
bear
the
stamp
of
justice
and
on
the
other
hand
if
we
try
to
say
this
man
is
virtuous
but
he
is
a
stranger
to
compassion
or
he
is
an
unjust
and
malicious
man
yet
very
compassionate
the
contradiction
at
once
leaps
to
light
in
former
times
the
english
plays
used
to
finish
with
a
petition
for
the
king
the
old
indian
dramas
close
with
these
words
may
all
living
beings
be
delivered
from
pain
tastes
differ
but
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
more
beautiful
prayer
than
this
also
from
separate
matters
of
detail
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
original
stimulus
of
true
morality
is
compassion
for
instance
to
make
a
man
lose
a
hundred
thalers
by
legal
tricks
involving
no
danger
is
equally
unjust
whether
he
be
rich
or
poor
but
in
the
latter
case
the
rapping
of
conscience
is
much
louder
the
censure
of
disinterested
witnesses
more
emphatic
aristotle
was
well
aware
of
this
and
said
δέ
εστι
τὸν
ἀτυχοῡντα
ἢ
τον
ετὐχοῡντα
it
is
worse
to
injure
a
man
in
adversity
than
one
who
is
prosperous
xxix
if
the
man
have
wealth
is
proportionally
faint
and
grows
still
fainter
if
it
be
the
treasury
that
has
been
overreached
for
state
coffers
can
form
no
object
of
compassion
it
thus
appears
that
the
grounds
for
as
well
as
for
the
spectators
blame
are
not
furnished
directly
by
the
infringement
of
the
law
but
chiefly
by
the
suffering
thereby
brought
upon
others
the
violation
of
right
by
itself
and
as
such
which
is
involved
in
cheating
the
exchequer
to
take
the
above
instance
will
be
disapproved
by
the
conscience
alike
of
actor
and
witness
but
only
because
and
in
so
far
as
the
rule
of
respecting
right
which
forms
the
qua
of
all
honourable
conduct
is
in
consequence
broken
the
stricture
passed
will
in
fact
be
indirect
and
limited
if
however
it
be
a
confidential
in
the
service
that
commits
the
fraud
the
case
assumes
quite
another
aspect
it
then
has
all
the
specific
attributes
of
and
belongs
to
that
class
of
actions
described
above
whose
characteristic
is
a
the
analysis
here
given
explains
why
the
worst
charge
which
can
ever
be
brought
against
rapacious
extortioners
and
legal
sharpers
is
that
they
appropriate
for
themselves
the
goods
of
widows
and
orphans
the
reason
appears
in
the
fact
that
the
latter
more
than
others
owing
to
their
helplessness
might
be
expected
to
excite
compassion
in
the
most
callous
heart
hence
we
conclude
that
the
entire
absence
of
this
sense
is
sufficient
to
lower
a
man
to
the
last
degree
of
villainy
compassion
is
the
root
no
less
of
justice
than
of
but
it
is
more
clearly
evidenced
in
the
latter
than
in
the
former
we
never
receive
proofs
of
genuine
on
the
part
of
others
so
long
as
we
are
in
all
respects
prosperous
the
happy
man
may
no
doubt
often
hear
the
words
of
on
his
and
friends
lips
but
the
expression
of
that
pure
disinterested
objective
participation
in
the
condition
and
lot
of
others
which
begets
is
reserved
for
him
who
is
stricken
with
some
sorrow
or
suffering
whatever
it
be
for
the
fortunate
we
do
not
feel
sympathy
unless
they
have
some
other
claim
on
us
they
remain
alien
to
our
hearts
sibi
they
may
keep
their
own
affairs
pleasures
to
themselves
nay
if
a
man
has
many
advantages
over
others
he
will
easily
become
an
object
of
envy
which
is
ready
should
he
once
fall
from
his
height
of
prosperity
to
turn
into
malignant
joy
nevertheless
this
menace
is
for
the
most
part
not
fulfilled
the
sophoclean
δ
ἐχθροί
his
enemies
laugh
does
not
generally
become
an
actual
fact
as
soon
as
the
day
of
ruin
comes
to
one
of
fortune
spoiled
children
there
usually
takes
place
a
great
transformation
in
the
minds
of
his
acquaintances
which
for
us
in
this
connection
is
very
instructive
in
the
first
place
this
change
clearly
reveals
the
real
nature
of
the
interest
that
the
friends
of
his
happiness
took
in
him
cadis
cum
faece
siccatis
when
the
casks
are
drained
to
the
dregs
one
friends
run
away
on
the
other
hand
the
exultation
of
those
who
envied
his
prosperity
the
mocking
laugh
of
malicious
satisfaction
which
he
feared
more
than
adversity
itself
and
the
contemplation
of
which
he
could
not
face
are
things
usually
spared
him
jealousy
is
appeased
and
disappears
with
its
cause
while
compassion
which
takes
its
place
is
the
parent
of
those
who
were
envious
of
and
hostile
to
a
man
in
the
full
tide
of
success
after
his
downfall
have
not
seldom
become
his
friends
ready
to
protect
comfort
and
help
who
has
not
at
least
in
a
small
way
himself
experienced
something
of
the
sort
where
is
the
man
who
when
overtaken
by
some
calamity
of
whatever
nature
has
not
noticed
with
surprise
how
the
persons
that
previously
had
displayed
the
greatest
coldness
nay
towards
him
then
came
forward
with
unfeigned
sympathy
for
misfortune
is
the
condition
of
compassion
and
compassion
the
source
of
when
our
wrath
is
kindled
against
a
person
nothing
quenches
it
so
quickly
even
when
it
is
righteous
as
the
words
he
is
an
unfortunate
man
and
the
reason
is
obvious
compassion
is
to
anger
as
water
to
fire
therefore
whoever
would
fain
have
nothing
to
repent
of
let
him
listen
to
my
advice
when
he
is
inflamed
with
rage
and
meditates
doing
some
one
a
grievous
injury
he
should
bring
the
thing
vividly
before
his
mind
as
a
he
should
clearly
picture
to
himself
this
other
tormented
with
mental
or
bodily
pain
or
struggling
with
need
and
misery
so
that
he
is
forced
to
exclaim
this
is
my
work
such
thoughts
as
these
if
anything
will
avail
to
moderate
his
wrath
for
compassion
is
the
true
antidote
of
anger
and
by
practising
on
oneself
this
artifice
of
the
imagination
one
awakes
beforehand
while
there
is
yet
time
pitié
dont
la
voix
est
vengé
fait
entendre
ses
voltaire
v
and
in
general
the
hatred
we
may
cherish
for
others
is
overcome
by
nothing
so
easily
as
by
our
taking
a
point
of
view
whence
they
can
appeal
to
our
compassion
the
reason
indeed
why
parents
as
a
rule
specially
love
the
sickly
one
of
their
children
is
because
the
sight
of
it
perpetually
stirs
their
compassion
there
is
another
proof
that
the
moral
incentive
disclosed
by
me
is
the
true
one
i
mean
the
fact
that
animals
also
are
included
under
its
protecting
aegis
in
the
other
european
systems
of
ethics
no
place
is
found
for
them
strange
and
inexcusable
as
this
may
appear
it
is
asserted
that
beasts
have
no
rights
the
illusion
is
harboured
that
our
conduct
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
has
no
moral
significance
or
as
it
is
put
in
the
language
of
these
codes
that
there
are
no
duties
to
be
fulfilled
towards
animals
such
a
view
is
one
of
revolting
coarseness
a
barbarism
of
the
west
whose
source
is
judaism
in
philosophy
however
it
rests
on
the
assumption
despite
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
of
the
radical
difference
between
man
and
beast
a
doctrine
which
as
is
well
known
was
proclaimed
with
more
trenchant
emphasis
by
descartes
than
by
any
one
else
it
was
indeed
the
necessary
consequence
of
his
mistakes
when
leibnitz
and
wolff
following
out
the
cartesian
view
built
up
out
of
abstract
ideas
their
rational
psychology
and
constructed
a
deathless
rational
soul
then
the
natural
claims
of
the
animal
kingdom
visibly
rose
up
against
this
exclusive
privilege
this
human
patent
of
immortality
and
nature
as
always
in
such
circumstances
entered
her
silent
protest
our
philosophers
owing
to
the
qualms
of
their
intellectual
conscience
were
soon
forced
to
seek
aid
for
their
rational
psychology
from
the
empirical
method
they
accordingly
tried
to
reveal
the
existence
of
a
vast
chasm
an
immeasurable
gulf
between
animals
and
men
in
order
to
represent
them
in
the
teeth
of
opposing
testimony
as
existences
essentially
different
these
efforts
did
not
escape
the
ridicule
of
boileau
for
we
find
him
saying
animaux
des
universités
fleurir
chez
eux
des
quatre
facultés
such
a
supposition
would
end
in
animals
being
pronounced
incapable
of
distinguishing
themselves
from
the
external
world
and
of
having
any
any
ego
as
answer
to
such
absurd
tenets
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
point
to
the
boundless
egoism
innate
in
every
animal
even
the
smallest
and
humblest
this
amply
proves
how
perfectly
they
are
conscious
of
their
self
as
opposed
to
the
world
which
lies
outside
it
if
any
one
of
the
cartesian
persuasion
with
views
like
these
in
his
head
should
find
himself
in
the
claws
of
a
tiger
he
would
be
taught
in
the
most
forcible
manner
what
a
sharp
distinction
such
a
beast
draws
between
his
ego
and
the
corresponding
to
these
philosophical
fallacies
we
notice
a
peculiar
sophism
in
the
speech
of
many
peoples
especially
the
germans
for
the
commonest
matters
connected
with
the
processes
of
life
for
food
drink
conception
the
bringing
forth
of
young
for
death
and
the
dead
body
such
languages
have
special
words
applicable
only
to
animals
not
to
men
in
this
way
the
necessity
of
using
the
same
terms
for
both
is
avoided
and
the
perfect
identity
of
the
thing
concealed
under
verbal
differences
now
since
the
ancient
tongues
show
no
trace
of
such
a
dual
mode
of
expression
but
frankly
denote
the
same
things
by
the
same
words
it
follows
that
this
miserable
artifice
is
beyond
all
doubt
the
work
of
european
priestcraft
which
in
its
profanity
knows
no
limit
to
its
disavowal
of
and
blasphemy
against
the
eternal
reality
that
lives
in
every
animal
thus
was
laid
the
foundation
of
that
harshness
and
cruelty
towards
beasts
which
is
customary
in
europe
and
on
which
a
native
of
the
asiatic
uplands
could
not
look
without
righteous
horror
in
english
this
infamous
invention
is
not
to
be
found
assuredly
because
the
saxons
when
they
conquered
england
were
not
yet
christians
nevertheless
the
english
language
shows
something
analogous
in
the
strange
fact
that
it
makes
all
animals
of
the
neuter
gender
the
pronoun
it
being
employed
for
them
just
as
if
they
were
lifeless
things
this
idiom
has
a
very
objectionable
sound
especially
in
the
case
of
dogs
monkeys
and
other
primates
and
is
unmistakably
a
priestly
trick
designed
to
reduce
beasts
to
the
level
of
inanimate
objects
the
ancient
egyptians
who
dedicated
all
their
days
to
religion
were
accustomed
to
place
in
the
same
vault
with
a
human
mummy
that
of
an
ibis
a
crocodile
etc
in
europe
it
is
a
crime
an
abomination
to
bury
a
faithful
dog
beside
the
of
his
master
though
it
is
there
perhaps
that
he
with
a
fidelity
and
attachment
unknown
to
the
sons
of
men
awaited
his
own
end
to
a
recognition
of
the
identity
in
all
essentials
of
the
phaenomena
which
we
call
man
and
beast
nothing
leads
more
surely
than
the
study
of
zoology
and
anatomy
what
shall
we
say
then
when
in
these
days
a
canting
dissector
has
been
found
who
presumes
to
insist
on
an
absolute
and
radical
difference
between
human
beings
and
animals
and
who
goes
so
far
as
to
attack
and
calumniate
honest
zoologists
that
keep
aloof
from
all
priestly
guile
and
hypocrisy
and
dare
to
follow
the
leading
of
nature
and
of
truth
those
persons
must
indeed
be
totally
blind
or
else
completely
chloroformed
by
the
jewish
stench
who
do
not
discern
that
the
truly
essential
and
fundamental
part
in
man
and
beast
is
identically
the
same
thing
that
which
distinguishes
the
one
from
the
other
does
not
lie
in
the
primary
and
original
principle
in
the
inner
nature
in
the
kernel
of
the
two
phaenomena
this
kernel
being
in
both
alike
the
will
of
the
individual
it
is
found
in
what
is
secondary
in
the
intellect
in
the
degree
of
perceptive
capacity
it
is
true
that
the
latter
is
incomparably
higher
in
man
by
reason
of
his
added
faculty
of
abstract
knowledge
called
reason
nevertheless
this
superiority
is
traceable
solely
to
a
greater
cerebral
development
in
other
words
to
the
corporeal
difference
which
is
quantitative
not
qualitative
of
a
single
part
the
brain
in
all
other
respects
the
similarity
between
men
and
animals
both
psychical
and
bodily
is
sufficiently
striking
so
that
we
must
remind
our
judaised
friends
in
the
west
who
despise
animals
and
idolise
reason
that
if
they
were
suckled
by
their
mothers
so
also
was
the
dog
by
his
even
kant
fell
into
this
common
mistake
of
his
age
and
of
his
country
and
i
have
already
administered
the
censure
which
it
is
impossible
to
withhold
the
fact
that
christian
morality
takes
no
thought
for
beasts
is
a
defect
in
the
system
which
is
better
admitted
than
perpetuated
one
astonishment
is
however
all
the
greater
because
with
this
exception
it
shows
the
closest
agreement
with
the
ethics
of
brahmanism
and
buddhism
being
only
less
strongly
expressed
and
not
carried
to
the
last
consequences
imposed
by
logic
on
the
whole
there
seems
little
room
for
doubting
that
in
common
with
the
idea
of
a
god
become
man
or
avatar
it
has
an
asiatic
origin
and
probably
came
to
judaea
by
way
of
egypt
so
that
christianity
would
be
a
secondary
reflection
of
the
primordial
light
that
shone
in
india
which
falling
first
on
egypt
was
unhappily
refracted
from
its
ruins
upon
jewish
soil
an
apt
symbol
of
the
insensibility
of
christian
ethics
to
animals
while
in
other
points
its
similarity
to
the
indian
is
so
great
may
be
found
in
the
circumstance
that
john
the
baptist
comes
before
us
in
all
respects
like
a
hindu
sannyasin
except
that
he
is
clothed
in
skins
a
thing
which
would
be
as
is
well
known
an
abomination
in
the
eyes
of
every
follower
of
brahmanism
or
buddhism
the
royal
society
of
calcutta
only
received
their
copy
of
the
vedas
on
their
distinctly
promising
that
they
would
not
have
it
bound
in
leather
after
european
fashion
in
silken
binding
therefore
it
is
now
to
be
seen
on
the
shelves
of
their
library
again
the
gospel
story
of
peter
draught
of
fishes
which
the
saviour
blesses
so
signally
that
the
boats
are
overladen
and
begin
to
sink
forms
a
characteristic
contrast
to
what
is
related
of
pythagoras
it
is
said
that
the
latter
initiated
as
he
was
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
bought
the
draught
from
the
fishermen
while
the
net
was
still
under
water
in
order
to
at
once
set
at
liberty
the

compassion
for
animals
is
intimately
connected
with
goodness
of
character
and
it
may
be
confidently
asserted
that
he
who
is
cruel
to
living
creatures
can
not
be
a
good
man
moreover
this
compassion
manifestly
flows
from
the
same
source
whence
arise
the
virtues
of
justice
and
towards
men
thus
for
instance
people
of
delicate
sensitiveness
on
realising
that
in
a
fit
of
or
anger
or
under
the
influence
of
wine
they
punished
their
dog
their
horse
their
ape
undeservedly
or
unnecessarily
or
excessively
are
seized
with
the
same
remorse
feel
the
same
dissatisfaction
with
themselves
as
when
they
are
conscious
of
having
done
some
wrong
to
one
of
their
fellows
the
only
difference
a
purely
nominal
one
is
that
in
the
latter
case
this
remorse
this
dissatisfaction
is
called
the
voice
of
conscience
rising
in
rebuke
i
remember
having
read
of
an
englishman
who
when
hunting
in
india
had
killed
a
monkey
that
he
could
not
forget
the
dying
look
which
the
creature
cast
on
him
so
that
he
never
fired
at
these
animals
again
another
sportsman
william
harris
by
name
a
true
nimrod
has
much
the
same
story
to
tell
during
the
years
he
travelled
far
into
the
heart
of
africa
merely
to
indulge
his
passion
for
the
chase
a
passage
in
his
book
published
at
bombay
in
describes
how
he
shot
his
first
elephant
a
female
next
morning
on
going
to
look
for
his
game
he
found
that
all
the
elephants
had
fled
from
the
neighbourhood
except
a
young
one
which
had
spent
the
night
beside
its
dead
mother
seeing
the
huntsmen
it
forgot
all
fear
and
came
to
meet
them
with
the
clearest
and
most
lively
signs
of
disconsolate
grief
and
put
its
tiny
trunk
about
them
as
if
to
beg
for
help
then
says
harris
i
was
filled
with
real
remorse
for
what
i
had
done
and
felt
as
if
i
had
committed
a
murder
the
english
nation
with
its
fine
sensibility
is
in
fact
distinguished
above
all
others
for
extraordinary
compassion
towards
animals
which
appears
at
every
opportunity
and
is
so
strong
that
despite
the
cold
superstition
which
otherwise
degrades
them
these
have
been
led
through
its
operation
to
fill
up
by
legislation
the
that
their
religion
leaves
in
morality
for
this
gap
is
precisely
the
reason
why
in
europe
and
america
there
is
need
of
societies
for
the
protection
of
animals
which
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
law
for
their
efficiency
in
asia
the
religions
themselves
suffice
consequently
no
one
there
ever
thinks
of
such
associations
meanwhile
europeans
are
awakening
more
and
more
to
a
sense
that
beasts
have
rights
in
proportion
as
the
strange
notion
is
being
gradually
overcome
and
outgrown
that
the
animal
kingdom
came
into
existence
solely
for
the
benefit
and
pleasure
of
man
this
view
with
the
corollary
that
living
creatures
are
to
be
regarded
merely
as
things
is
at
the
root
of
the
rough
and
altogether
reckless
treatment
of
them
which
obtains
in
the
west
to
the
honour
then
of
the
english
be
it
said
that
they
are
the
first
people
who
have
in
downright
earnest
extended
the
protecting
arm
of
the
law
to
animals
in
england
the
miscreant
that
commits
an
outrage
on
beasts
has
to
pay
for
it
equally
whether
they
are
his
own
or
not
nor
is
this
all
there
exists
in
london
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
a
corporate
body
voluntarily
formed
which
without
state
assistance
and
at
great
cost
is
of
no
small
service
in
lessening
the
tale
of
tortures
inflicted
on
animals
its
emissaries
are
ubiquitous
and
keep
secret
watch
in
order
to
inform
against
the
tormentors
of
dumb
sensitive
creatures
and
such
persons
have
therefore
good
reason
to
stand
in
fear
of
them
at
all
the
steep
bridges
in
london
this
society
stations
a
pair
of
horses
which
without
any
charge
is
attached
to
heavy
is
not
this
admirable
does
it
not
elicit
our
approval
as
unfailingly
as
any
beneficent
action
towards
men
also
the
philanthropic
society
of
london
has
done
its
part
in
it
offered
a
prize
of
for
the
best
exposition
of
the
moral
reasons
which
exist
to
keep
men
from
torturing
animals
the
line
of
argument
however
had
to
be
taken
almost
exclusively
from
christianity
whereby
the
difficulty
of
the
task
was
of
course
increased
but
two
years
later
in
macnamara
was
the
successful
competitor
at
philadelphia
there
is
an
animals
friends
society
having
the
same
aims
and
it
is
to
the
president
of
the
latter
that
a
book
called
or
moral
reflections
on
the
actual
condition
of
animals
and
the
means
of
improving
the
brussels
has
been
dedicated
by
its
author
forster
it
is
original
and
well
written
forster
earnestly
commends
to
his
readers
the
humane
treatment
of
animals
as
an
englishman
he
naturally
tries
to
strengthen
his
position
by
the
support
of
the
bible
but
he
is
on
slippery
ground
and
meets
with
such
poor
success
that
he
ends
by
catching
at
the
following
ingenious
position
jesus
christ
he
says
was
born
in
a
stable
among
oxen
and
asses
which
was
meant
to
indicate
symbolically
that
we
ought
to
regard
the
beasts
as
our
brothers
and
treat
them
accordingly
all
that
i
have
here
adduced
sufficiently
proves
that
the
moral
chord
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
now
at
length
beginning
to
vibrate
also
in
the
west
for
the
rest
we
may
observe
that
compassion
for
sentient
beings
is
not
to
carry
us
to
the
length
of
abstaining
from
flesh
like
the
brahmans
this
is
because
by
a
natural
law
capacity
for
pain
keeps
pace
with
the
intelligence
consequently
men
by
going
without
animal
food
especially
in
the
north
would
suffer
more
than
beasts
do
through
a
quick
death
which
is
always
unforeseen
although
the
latter
ought
to
be
made
still
easier
by
means
of
chloroform
indeed
without
meat
nourishment
mankind
would
be
quite
unable
to
withstand
the
rigours
of
the
northern
climate
the
same
reasoning
explains
too
why
we
are
right
in
making
animals
work
for
us
it
is
only
when
they
are
subjected
to
an
excessive
amount
of
toil
that
cruelty
begins
it
is
perhaps
not
impossible
to
investigate
and
explain
metaphysically
the
ultimate
cause
of
that
compassion
in
which
alone
all
conduct
can
have
its
source
but
let
us
for
the
moment
put
aside
such
inquiries
and
consider
the
phaenomenon
in
question
from
the
empirical
point
of
view
simply
as
a
natural
arrangement
now
if
nature
intention
was
to
soften
as
much
as
possible
the
numberless
sufferings
of
every
sort
to
which
our
life
is
exposed
and
which
no
one
altogether
escapes
if
she
wished
to
provide
some
counterbalance
for
the
burning
egoism
which
fills
all
beings
and
often
develops
into
malice
it
will
at
once
strike
every
one
as
obvious
that
she
could
not
have
chosen
any
method
more
effectual
than
that
of
planting
in
the
human
heart
the
wonderful
disposition
which
inclines
one
man
to
share
the
pain
of
another
and
from
which
proceeds
the
voice
that
bids
us
in
tones
strong
and
unmistakable
take
thought
for
our
neighbour
calling
at
one
time
protect
at
another
help
assuredly
from
the
mutual
succour
thus
arising
there
was
more
to
be
hoped
for
towards
the
attainment
of
universal
than
from
a
stern
command
of
duty
couched
in
general
abstract
terms
the
product
of
certain
reasoning
processes
and
of
artificial
combinations
of
conceptions
from
such
an
imperative
indeed
all
the
less
result
could
be
expected
because
to
the
rough
human
unit
general
propositions
and
abstract
truths
are
unintelligible
the
concrete
only
having
some
meaning
for
him
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
mankind
in
its
entirety
a
very
small
part
alone
excepted
has
always
been
rude
and
must
remain
so
since
the
large
amount
of
bodily
toil
which
for
the
race
as
a
whole
is
inevitable
leaves
no
time
for
mental
culture
whereas
in
order
to
awaken
that
sense
which
has
been
proved
to
be
the
sole
source
of
disinterested
action
and
consequently
the
true
basis
of
morals
there
is
no
need
of
abstract
knowledge
but
only
of
intuitive
perception
of
the
simple
comprehension
of
a
concrete
case
to
this
compassion
is
at
once
responsive
without
the
mediation
of
other
thoughts
the
following
circumstance
will
be
found
in
complete
accord
with
the
last
paragraph
the
foundation
which
i
have
given
to
ethics
leaves
me
without
a
forerunner
among
the
school
philosophers
indeed
my
position
is
paradoxical
as
far
as
their
teaching
goes
and
many
of
them
for
instance
the
stoics
seneca
spinoza
prop
and
kant
der
praktischen
vernunft
only
notice
the
motive
of
compassion
to
utterly
reject
and
contemn
it
on
the
other
hand
my
basis
is
supported
by
the
authority
of
the
greatest
moralist
of
modern
times
for
such
undoubtedly
rousseau
is
that
profound
reader
of
the
human
heart
who
drew
his
wisdom
not
from
books
but
from
life
and
intended
his
doctrine
not
for
the
professorial
chair
but
for
humanity
he
the
foe
of
all
prejudice
the
of
nature
whom
alone
she
endowed
with
the
gift
of
being
able
to
moralise
without
tediousness
because
he
hit
the
truth
and
stirred
the
heart
i
shall
therefore
venture
here
to
cite
some
passages
from
his
works
in
support
of
my
theory
observing
that
so
far
i
have
been
as
sparing
as
possible
with
regard
to
quotations
in
the

inside

as

remarked
there
is
not
a

of
my
position
but
outside
i
have
other
testimony
to
cite
in
addition
to
rousseau
the
chinese
admit
five
cardinal
virtues
tschang
of
which
the
chief
is
compassion
the
other
four
are
justice
courtesy
wisdom
and
sincerity
similarly
among
the
hindus
we
find
that
on
the
tablets
placed
to
the
memory
of
dead
chieftains
compassion
for
men
and
animals
takes
the
first
place
in
the
record
of
their
virtues
at
athens
there
was
an
altar
to
compassion
in
the
agora

pausanias

also
mentions
this

in

compassion
as

it
is
clear
then
that
the
real
source
of
morality
has
been
distinctly
recognised
at
all
times
and
in
all
countries
europe
alone
excepted
owing
to
the
jewish
stench
which
here
pervades
everything
and
is
the
reason
why
the
western
races
require
for
the
object
of
their
obedience
a
command
of
duty
a
moral
law
an
imperative
in
short
an
order
and
decree
they
remain
wedded
to
this
habit
of
thought
and
refuse
to
open
their
eyes
to
the
fact
that
such
a
view
is
after
all
based
upon
nothing
but
egosim
of
course
now
and
then
isolated
individuals
of
fine
perception
have
felt
the
truth
and
given
it
utterance
such
a
one
was
rousseau
and
such
lessing
in
a
letter
written
by
the
latter
in

read
the
best
man
and
the
one
most
likely
to
excel
in
all
social
virtues
in
all
forms
of
magnanimity
is
he
who
is
most
compassionate
this
term
appears
to
have
been
first
used
by
newton
and
boyle
the
sense
is
undoubtedly
derived
from
bacon

of

have
shown
that
its
origin
can
be
traced
to
the
old
testament
how
seriously
the
matter
is
being
taken
up
may
be
seen
from
the
following
case
which
is
quite
recent
i
quote
from
the
of
december
arrest
of
a
company
of
abettors
of
it
had
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
society
of
animals
friends
that
the
square
in
fox
street
birmingham
was
yesterday
to
be
the
scene
of
a
measures
were
accordingly
taken
to
secure
the
assistance
of
the
police
and
a
strong
detachment
of
constables
was
sent
to
the
spot
at
the
right
moment
all
the
persons
present
were
arrested
these
precious
conspirators
were
then
handcuffed
together
in
pairs
and
the
whole
party
was
made
fast
by
a
long
rope
passing
between
each
couple
in
this
fashion
they
were
marched
off
to
the
police
station
where
mayor
and
magistrate
were
sitting
in
readiness
for
them
the
two
ringleaders
were
condemned
to
pay
each
a
fine
of
and
costs
in
default
to
undergo
hard
labour
the
coxcombs
whose
habit
is
never
to
miss
noble
sport
of
this
sort
must
have
looked
somewhat
crestfallen
in
the
midst
of
the
procession
but
the
of
april
supplies
a
still
more
striking
instance
from
the
present
day
and
here
we
find
the
paper
itself
assuming
judicial
functions
and
imposing
the
right
punishment
it
recounts
the
case
of
a
very
wealthy
scotch
baronet
daughter
the
matter
had
been
brought
before
the
law
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
girl
had
used
a
cudgel
and
knife
on
her
horse
with
the
greatest
cruelty
for
which
she
was
ordered
to
pay
a
fine
of
but
for
one
in
her
position
such
a
sum
means
nothing
and
she
would
practically
have
got
off
had
not
the
intervened
to
inflict
on
her
a
proper
correction
such
as
she
would
really
feel
it
twice
mentions
the
young
lady
name
in
full
printing
it
in
large
type
and
concludes
as
follows
we
can
not
help
saying
that
a
few
imprisonment
with
the
addition
of
an
occasional
whipping
administered
in
private
but
by
the
most
muscular
woman
in
hampshire
would
have
been
a
much
more
suitable
penalty
for
miss
a
wretched
being
of
this
sort
has
forfeited
all
the
consideration
and
the
privileges
that
attach
to
her
sex
we
can
not
regard
her
any
longer
as
a
woman
these
newspaper
paragraphs
i
would
especially
recommend
to
the
notice
of
the
associations
now
formed
in
germany
against
cruelty
to
animals
for
they
show
what
lines
should
be
adopted
in
order
to
reach
some
solid
result
at
the
same
time
i
desire
to
express
my
cordial
appreciation
of
the
praiseworthy
zeal
shown
by
herrn
hofrath
perner
of
munich
who
has
entirely
devoted
himself
to
this
branch
of
and
succeeded
in
arousing
interest
in
it
all
over
the
country
it
should
be
observed
that
the
first
portion
of
this
note
belongs
to
the
earliest
edition
of
the
work
published
september
the
latter
part
was
written
for
the
second
edition
which
appeared
in
august
this
explains
why
schopenhauer
says
that
the
first
instance
dated
is
quite
recent
and
that
the
second
dated
is
taken
from
the
present
there
is
another
principle
which
hobbes
did
not
perceive
at
all
it
was
implanted
in
man
in
order
to
soften
in
certain
circumstances
the
fierceness
of
his
and
it
moderates
the
ardour
which
he
feels
for
his
own
by
producing
a
certain
aversion
to
the
sight
of
a
in
attributing
to
man
only
natural
virtue
which
even
the
most
advanced
scepticism
has
been
forced
to
recognise
i
stand
assuredly
in
no
fear
of
any
contradiction
i
allude
to
etc
mandeville
was
right
in
thinking
that
with
all
their
systems
of
morality
men
would
never
have
been
anything
but
monsters
if
nature
had
not
given
them
to
support
their
reason
but
he
failed
to
see
that
this
one
quality
spring
all
the
social
which
he
was
unwilling
to
credit
mankind
with
in
reality
what
is
generosity
clemency
humanity
if
not
applied
to
the
weak
to
the
guilty
or
to
the
human
race
as
a
whole
even
benevolence
and
friendship
if
we
look
at
the
matter
rightly
are
seen
to
result
from
a
constant
compassion
directed
upon
a
particular
object
for
to
desire
that
some
one
should
not
suffer
is
nothing
else
than
to
desire
that
he
should
be
happy
the
more
closely
living
spectator
identifies
himself
with
the
living
sufferer
the
more
active
does
pity
become
it
is
then
quite
certain
that
compassion
is
a
natural
feeling
which
checking
as
it
does
the
love
of
self
in
each
individual
helps
by
a
reciprocal
process
to
preserve
the
whole
race
this
it
is
which
in
the
state
of
nature
takes
the
place
of
laws
customs
and
virtues
with
the
added
advantage
that
no
one
will
be
tempted
to
disobey
its
gentle
voice
this
it
is
which
will
restrain
every
savage
provided
he
hope
to
find
his
own
livelihood
elsewhere
from
robbing
a
weak
child
or
depriving
an
infirm
old
man
of
the
subsistence
won
by
hard
toil
this
it
is
which
inspires
all
men
not
indeed
with
that
sublime
maxim
of
reasoned
justice
do
to
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
but
with
another
rule
of
natural
goodness
no
doubt
less
perfect
but
perhaps
more
useful
namely
do
what
is
good
for
yourself
with
the
least
possible
harm
to
others
in
a
word
it
is
this
natural
feeling
rather
than
in
subtle
that
we
must
look
for
the
reason
of
the
repugnance
with
which
every
one
is
accustomed
to
view
bad
conduct
quite
independently
of
the
principles
laid
down
by
education
in
fact
how
is
it
that
we
let
ourselves
be
moved
to
pity
if
not
by
getting
out
of
our
own
consciousness
and
identified
with
the
living
sufferer
by
so
to
say
own
being
and
entering
into
his
we
do
not
suffer
except
as
we
suppose
he
suffers
is
not
in
us
it
is
in
that
we
suffer
offer
a
young
man
objects
on
which
the
expansive
force
of
his
heart
can
act
objects
such
as
may
enlarge
his
nature
and
incline
it
to
go
out
to
in
whom
he
may
everywhere
himself
keep
carefully
away
those
things
which
narrow
his

on

there
still

a
question

can
be
presented
in

it
is
this
on
what

the

difference
in

of

rest
if
compassion
be
the
original

of
all

that
is
disinterested
justice
and
how
comes
it
that
some
are

others
are

thereby
are
we
to
suppose
that
ethics
which
discloses
the
moral
stimulus
is
also
capable
of
setting
it
in
motion
can
ethics
fashion
the
man
anew
so
that
he
becomes
compassionate
and
as
a
consequence
just
and
humane
certainly
not
the
difference
of
character
is
innate
and
ineradicable
the
wicked
man
is
born
with
his
wickedness
as
much
as

on
examining
the
virtues
and
vices
as
summarised
by
aristotle
in
the

et
it
will
be
found
that
all
of
them
without
exception
are
not
properly
thinkable
unless
assumed
to
be
inborn
qualities
and
that
only
as
such
can
they
be
genuine
if
in
consequence
of
reasoned
reflection
we
take
them
as
voluntary
they
are
then
seen
to
lose
their
reality
and
pass
into
the
region
of
empty
forms
whence
it
immediately
follows
that
their
permanence
and
resistance
under
the
storm
and
stress
of
circumstance
could
not
be
counted
on
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
virtue
of
of
which
aristotle
in
common
with
all
the
ancients
knows
nothing
montaigne
keeps
of
course
his
sceptical
tone
but
he
practically
agrees
with
the
venerable
authorities
above
quoted
when
he
says

chap
lichtenberg
hits
the
mark
exactly
in
his
moralische
he
writes
all
virtue
arising
from
premeditation
is
not
worth
much
what
is
wanted
is
feeling
or
habit
lastly
it
should
be
noted
that
christianity
itself
in
its
original
teaching
recognises
and
bears
witness
to
this
inherent
immutable
difference
between
character
and
character
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
we
find
the
allegory
of
the
fruit
which
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
tree
that
bears
it

cf

and
then
in

his
profound
doctrine
of
the
and
character
he
showed
that
the
empirical
character
which
manifests
itself
in
time
and
in
multiplicity
of
action
is
a
phaenomenon
while
the
reality
behind
it
is
the
intelligible
character
which
being
the
essential
constitution
of
the
thing
in
itself
underlying
the
phaenomenon
is
independent
of
time
space
plurality
and
change
in
this
way
alone
can
be
explained
what
is
so
astonishing
and
yet
so
well
known
to
all
who
have
learnt
lessons
the
fixed
unchangeableness
of
human
character
there
are
certain
ethical
writers
whose
aim
is
the
moral
improvement
of
men
and
who
talk
of
progress
made
in
the
path
of
virtue
but
their
assurances
are
always
met
and
victoriously
confuted
by
the
irrefragable
facts
of
experience
which
prove
that
virtue
is
nature
work
and
can
not
be
inculcated
the
character
is
an
original
datum
immutable
and
incapable
of
any
amelioration
through
correction
by
the
intellect
now
were
this
not
so
and
further
if
as
the
preachers
maintain
an
improvement
of
the
character
and
hence
a
constant
advance
towards
the
good
were
possible
by
means
of
moral
instruction
then
unless
we
are
prepared
to
suppose
that
all
the
various
religious
institutions
and
all
the
efforts
of
the
moralists
fail
in
their
purpose
we
should
certainly
expect
to
find
that
the
older
half
of
mankind
at
least
on
an
average
is
distinctly
better
than
the
younger
this
however
is
so
far
from
being
the
case
that
it
is
not
to
the
old
who
have
as
we
see
grown
worse
by
experience
but
to
the
young
that
we
look
for
something
good
it
may
happen
that
in
his
old
age
one
man
appears
somewhat
better
another
worse
than
he
was
in
his
youth
but
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
it
is
simply
because
with
length
of
days
the
intelligence
by
constant
correction
becomes
riper
and
hence
the
character
stands
out
in
purer
and
clearer
shape
while
early
life
is
a
prey
to
ignorance
mistakes
and
chimeras
which
now
present
false
motives
and
now
veil
the
real
for
a
fuller
explanation
i
would
refer
the
reader
to
the
principles
laid
down
in
chapter
iii
of
the
preceding
essay
on
the
freedom
of
the
will
it
is
true
that
among
convicts
the
young
have
a
large
majority
but
this
is
because
when
a
tendency
to
crime
exists
in
the
character
it
soon
finds
a
way
of
expressing
itself
in
acts
and
of
reaching
its
goal
the
galleys
or
the
gibbet
while
he
whom
all
the
inducements
to
wrong
doing
which
a
long
life
offers
have
failed
to
lead
astray
is
not
likely
to
fall
at
the
eleventh
hour
hence
the
respect
paid
to
age
is
in
my
opinion
due
to
the
fact
that
the
old
are
considered
to
have
passed
through
a
test
of
sixty
or
seventy
years
and
kept
their
integrity
unsullied
for
this
of
course
is
the
qua
of
the
honour
accorded
them
these
things
are
too
well
known
for
any
one
in
real
life
to
be
misled
by
the
promises
of
the
moralists
we
have
spoken
of
he
who
has
once
been
proved
guilty
of
is
never
again
trusted
just
as
the
noble
nature
of
which
a
man
has
once
given
evidence
is
always
confidently
believed
in
whatever
else
may
have
changed
sequitur
what
one
does
follows
from
what
one
is
forms
as
we
have
seen
in
part
chapter
a
pregnant
tenet
of
the
schoolmen
everything
in
the
world
works
according
to
the
unchangeable
constitution
of
which
its
being
its
is
composed
and
man
is
no
exception
as
the
individual
is
so
will
he
so
must
he
act
and
the
arbitrium
free
and
indifferent
choice
is
an
invention
of
philosophy
in
her
childhood
long
since
exploded
although
there
are
some
old
women
in
doctor
academicals
who
still
like
to
drag
it
about
with
them
the
three
fundamental
springs
of
human
action
egoism
malice
compassion
are
inherent
in
every
one
in
different
and
strangely
unequal
proportions
their
combination
in
any
given
case
determines
the
weight
of
the
motives
that
present
themselves
and
shapes
the
resulting
line
of
conduct
to
an
egoistic
character
egoistic
motives
alone
appeal
and
those
which
suggest
either
compassion
or
malice
have
no
appreciable
effect
thus
a
man
of
this
type
will
sacrifice
his
interests
as
little
to
take
vengeance
on
his
foes
as
to
help
his
friends
another
whose
nature
is
highly
susceptible
to
malicious
motives
will
not
shrink
from
doing
great
harm
to
himself
so
only
he
may
injure
his
neighbour
for
there
are
characters
which
take
such
delight
in
working
mischief
on
others
that
they
forget
their
own
loss
which
is
perhaps
equal
to
what
they
inflict
one
may
say
of
such
alteri
noceat
sui
disregarding
himself
so
long
as
he
injures
the
other
these
are
the
people
that
plunge
with
passionate
joy
into
the
battle
in
which
they
expect
to
receive
quite
as
many
wounds
as
they
deal
indeed
experience
not
seldom
testifies
that
they
are
ready
deliberately
first
to
kill
the
man
who
thwarts
their
purposes
and
then
themselves
in
order
to
escape
the
penalty
of
the
law
on
the
other
hand
of
consists
of
a
deeply
felt
compassion
for
everything
that
has
breath
and
especially
for
man
because
in
proportion
as
the
intelligence
develops
capacity
for
pain
increases
and
hence
the
countless
sufferings
of
human
beings
in
mind
and
body
have
a
much
stronger
claim
to
compassion
than
those
of
animals
which
are
only
physical
and
in
any
case
less
acute
this
goodness
of
heart
therefore
in
the
first
place
restrains
a
man
from
doing
any
sort
of
harm
to
others
and
next
it
bids
him
give
succour
whenever
and
wherever
he
sees
distress
and
the
path
of
compassion
may
lead
as
far
in
one
direction
as
malice
does
in
the
other
certain
rare
characters
of
fine
sensibility
take
to
heart
the
calamities
of
others
more
than
their
own
so
that
they
make
sacrifices
which
it
may
be
entail
on
themselves
a
greater
amount
of
suffering
than
that
removed
from
those
they
benefit
nay
in
cases
where
several
or
perhaps
a
large
number
of
persons
at
one
time
can
be
helped
in
this
way
such
men
do
not
if
need
be
flinch
from
absolute
arnold
von
winkelried
was
one
of
these
so
was
paulinus
bishop
of
nola
in
the
fifth
century
when
the
vandals
crossed
over
from
africa
and
invaded
italy
of
him
we
read
in
johann
von
müller
bk
chap
that
in
order
to
ransom
some
of
the
prisoners
he
had
already
disposed
of
all
the
church
plate
his
own
and
his
friends
private
property
then
on
seeing
the
anguish
of
a
widow
whose
only
son
was
being
carried
off
he
offered
himself
for
servitude
in
the
other
stead
for
whoever
was
of
suitable
age
and
had
not
fallen
by
the
sword
was
taken
captive
to
carthage
there
is
then
an
enormous
difference
between
character
and
character
being
original
and
innate
it
measures
the
responsiveness
of
the
individual
to
this
or
that
motive
and
those
alone
to
which
he
is
specially
sensitive
will
appeal
to
him
with
anything
like
compelling
force
as
in
chemistry
with
unchangeable
certainty
one
substance
reacts
only
upon
acids
another
only
upon
alkalies
so
with
equal
invariableness
different
natures
respond
to
different
stimuli
the
motives
suggesting
which
stir
so
deeply
a
good
disposition
can
of
themselves
effect
nothing
in
a
heart
that
listens
only
to
the
promptings
of
egoism
if
it
be
wished
to
induce
the
egoist
to
act
with
beneficence
and
humanity
this
can
be
done
but
in
one
way
he
must
be
made
to
believe
that
the
assuaging
of
others
suffering
will
somehow
or
other
surely
turn
out
to
his
what
indeed
are
most
moral
systems
but
attempts
of
different
kinds
in
this
direction
but
such
procedure
only
misleads
does
not
better
the
will
to
make
a
real
improvement
it
would
be
necessary
to
transform
the
entire
nature
of
the
individual
susceptibility
for
motives
thus
from
one
we
should
have
to
remove
his
indifference
to
the
suffering
of
others
as
such
from
another
the
delight
which
he
feels
in
causing
pain
from
a
third
the
natural
tendency
which
makes
him
regard
the
smallest
increase
of
his
own
as
so
far
outweighing
all
other
motives
that
the
latter
become
as
dust
in
the
balance
only
it
is
far
easier
to
change
lead
into
gold
than
to
accomplish
such
a
task
for
it
means
the
turning
round
so
to
say
of
a
man
heart
in
his
body
the
remoulding
of
his
very
being
in
point
of
fact
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
clear
the
correct
the
and
so
bring
him
to
a
better
comprehension
of
the
objective
realities
and
actual
relations
of
life
this
effected
the
only
result
gained
is
that
his
will
reveals
itself
more
logically
distinctly
and
decidedly
with
no
false
ring
in
its
utterance
it
should
be
noted
that
just
as
many
a
good
act
rests
at
bottom
on
false
motives
on
yet
illusory
representations
of
an
advantage
to
be
obtained
thereby
in
this
or
another
world
so
not
a
few
misdeeds
are
due
solely
to
an
imperfect
understanding
of
the
conditions
of
human
life
it
is
on
this
latter
truth
that
the
american
penitentiary
system
is
based
here
the
aim
is
not
to
improve
the
but
simply
to
educate
the
of
the
criminal
so
that
he
may
intellectually
come
to
perceive
that
prosperity
is
more
surely
indeed
more
easily
reached
by
work
and
honesty
than
by
idleness
and
knavery
by
the
proper
presentment
of
motives
may
be
secured
but
not
it
is
possible
to
remodel
what
one
does
but
not
what
one
to
and
it
is
to
the
will
alone
that
real
moral
worth
belongs
it
is
not
possible
to
change
the
goal
which
the
will
strives
after
but
only
the
path
expected
to
lead
thither
instruction
may
alter
the
selection
of
means
but
not
the
choice
of
the
ultimate
object
which
the
individual
keeps
before
him
in
all
he
does
this
is
determined
by
his
will
in
accordance
with
its
original
nature
it
is
true
that
the
egoist
may
be
brought
to
understand
that
if
he
gives
up
certain
small
advantages
he
will
gain
greater
and
the
malicious
man
may
be
taught
that
by
injuring
others
he
will
injure
himself
still
more
but
egoism
itself
and
malice
itself
will
never
be
argued
out
of
a
person
as
little
as
a
cat
can
be
talked
out
of
her
inclination
for
mice
similarly
with
goodness
of
heart
if
the
judgment
be
trained
if
the
relations
and
conditions
of
life
become
understood
in
a
word
if
the
intellect
be
enlightened
the
character
dominated
by
will
be
led
to
express
itself
more
consistently
and
completely
than
it
otherwise
could
this
happens
when
we
perceive
the
remoter
consequences
which
our
conduct
has
for
others
the
sufferings
perhaps
that
overtake
them
indirectly
and
only
after
lapse
of
time
through
one
act
or
another
of
ours
which
we
had
no
idea
was
so
harmful
it
occurs
too
when
we
come
to
discern
the
evil
results
of
many
a
action
as
for
instance
the
screening
of
a
criminal
and
it
is
especially
true
when
we
realise
that
the
injure
no
one
has
in
all
cases
precedence
over
the
help
all
men
in
this
sense
there
is
undoubtedly
such
a
thing
as
a
moral
education
an
ethical
training
capable
of
making
men
better
but
it
goes
only
as
far
as
i
have
indicated
and
its
limits
are
quickly
discovered
the
head
is
filled
with
the
light
of
knowledge
the
heart
remains
unimproved
the
fundamental
and
determining
element
in
things
moral
no
less
than
in
things
intellectual
and
things
physical
is
that
which
is
inborn
art
is
always
subordinate
and
can
only
lend
a
helping
hand
each
man
is
what
he

but
the
reader
i
am
sure
has
long
been
wishing
to
put
the
question
where
then
does
blame
and
merit
come
in
the
answer
is
fully
contained
in
part
il
chapter
to
which
i
therefore
beg
to
call
particular
attention
it
is
there
that
the
explanation
which
otherwise
would
now
follow
found
a
natural
place
because
the
matter
is
closely
connected
with
kant
doctrine
of
the
of
freedom
and
necessity
our
investigation
led
to
the
conclusion
that
once
the
motives
are
brought
into
play
the
what
is
done
is
a
thing
of
absolute
necessity
consequently
freedom
the
existence
of
which
is
betokened
solely
by
the
sense
of
can
not
but
belong
to
the
what
one
is
no
doubt
the
reproaches
of
conscience
have
to
do
in
the
first
place
and
ostensibly
with
our
acts
but
through
these
they
in
reality
reach
down
to
what
we
are
for
what
we
do
is
the
only
indisputable
index
of
what
we
and
reflects
our
character
just
as
faithfully
as
symptoms
betray
the
malady
hence
it
is
to
this
to
what
we
that
blame
and
merit
must
ultimately
be
attributed
whatever
we
esteem
and
love
or
else
despise
and
hate
in
others
is
not
a
changeable
transient
appearance
but
something
constant
stable
and
persistent
it
is
that
which
they
are
if
we
find
reason
to
alter
our
first
opinion
about
any
one
we
do
not
suppose
that
he
is
changed
but
that
we
have
been
mistaken
in
him
in
like
manner
when
we
are
pleased
or
displeased
with
our
own
conduct
we
say
that
we
are
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
with
ourselves
meaning
in
reality
with
that
which
we
are
and
are
unalterably
irreversibly
and
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
our
intellectual
qualities
nay
it
even
applies
to
the
physiognomy
how
is
it
possible
then
for
blame
and
merit
to
lie
otherwise
than
in
what
we
as
we
saw
in
part
chapter
conscience
is
that
of
our
acts
which
is
always
growing
longer
and
therefore
that
acquaintance
with
ourselves
which
every
day
becomes
more
complete
conscience
concerns
itself
directly
with
all
that
we
do
when
at
one
time
actuated
by
egoism
or
perhaps
malice
we
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
compassion
which
bids
us
at
least
refrain
from
harming
others
if
we
will
not
afford
them
help
and
protection
or
when
again
at
another
time
we
overcome
the
first
two
incentives
and
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
third
both
cases
measure
the
we
between
ourselves
and
and
on
depends
in
the
last
resort
the
degree
of
our
morality
or
immorality
that
is
of
our
justice
and
or
the
reverse
little
by
little
the
number
of
those
actions
whose
testimony
is
significant
on
this
point
accumulates
in
the
storehouse
of
our
memory
and
thus
the
lineaments
of
our
character
are
depicted
with
ever
greater
clearness
and
a
true
knowledge
of
ourselves
is
nearer
attainment
and
out
of
such
knowledge
there
springs
a
sense
of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
with
ourselves
with
that
which
we
are
according
as
we
have
been
ruled
by
egoism
by
malice
or
else
by
compassion
in
other
words
according
as
the
difference
we
have
made
between
ourselves
and
others
is
greater
or
smaller
and
when
we
look
outside
ourselves
it
is
by
the
same
standard
that
we
judge
those
about
us
and
we
become
acquainted
with
their
character
less
perfectly
indeed
yet
by
the
same
empirical
method
as
we
employ
with
reference
to
our
own
in
this
case
our
feelings
take
the
form
of
praise
approval
respect
or
on
the
other
hand
of
reproach
displeasure
contempt
and
they
are
the
objective
translation
so
to
say
of
the
subjective
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
the
latter
deepening
perhaps
into
remorse
which
arises
in
us
when
we
sit
in
judgment
on
ourselves
lastly
there
is
the
evidence
of
language
we
find
certain
constantly
occurring
forms
of
speech
which
bear
eloquent
testimony
to
the
fact
that
the
blame
we
cast
upon
others
is
in
reality
directed
against
their
unchangeable
character
touching
but
superficially
what
they
do
that
virtue
and
vice
are
practically
if
tacitly
regarded
as
inherent
unalterable
qualities
the
following
are
some
of
these

is
the

as
delivered

a
little
consideration
will
show
that
this
definition
harmonises
perfectly
with
and
hence
receives
additional
confirmation
from
what
i
have
here
specially
emphasised
namely
the
fact
that
for
the
motives
of
egoism
of
malice
and
of
compassion
which
is
so
widely
dissimilar
in
different
individuals
and
on
which
the
whole
moral
value
of
a
man
depends
can
not
be
interpreted
by
anything
else
nor
be
gained
or
removed
by
instruction
as
if
it
were
something
born
in
time
and
therefore
variable
and
subject
to
chance
on
the
contrary
we
have
seen
that
it
is
innate
and
fixed
an
ultimate
datum
admitting
of
no
further
explanation
thus
an
entire
life
with
the
whole
of
its
manifold
activity
may
be
likened
to
a
that
marks
every
movement
of
the
internal
works
as
they
were
made
once
for
all
or
it
resembles
a
mirror
wherein
alone
with
the
eye
of
his
intellect
each
person
sees
reflected
the
essential
nature
of
his
own
will

is
the
core
of
his
being

trouble
to
thoroughly

discover
in
the
foundation
given
by
me
to
ethics
a
logical
consecution
a
rounded
completeness
wanting
to
all
other
theories
to
say
nothing
of
the
consonance
of
my
view
with
the
facts
of
experience
a
consonance
which
he
will
look
for
in

elsewhere
for
only
the
truth
can
uniformly
and
consistently
agree
with
itself
and
with
nature
while
all
false
principles
are
internally
at
variance
with
themselves
and
externally
contradict
the
testimony
of
experience
which
at
every
step
records
its
silent
protest
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
the
truths
advanced
in
this
essay
and
particularly
here
at
the
close
strike
directly
at
many
deeply
rooted
prejudices
and
mistakes
and
especially
at
those
attaching
to
a
certain
rudimentary
system
of
morals
now
much
in
vogue
and
suitable
for
elementary
schools
but
i
can
not
own
to
feeling
any
penitence
or
regret
for
in
the
first
place
i
am
addressing
neither
children
nor
the
but
an
academy
of
light
and
learning
their
inquiry
is
a
purely
theoretical
one
concerned
with
the
ultimate
fundamental
verities
of
ethics
and
to
a
most
serious
question
a
serious
answer
is
undoubtedly
expected
and
secondly
in
my
opinion
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
harmless
mistakes
still
less
privileged
or
useful
ones
on
the
contrary
every
error
works
infinitely
more
evil
than
good
if
however
it
is
wished
to
make
existing
prepossessions
the
standard
of
truth
or
the
boundary
beyond
which
its
investigation
is
not
to
go
then
it
would
be
more
honest
to
abolish
philosophical
faculties

altogether

on
the
metaphysical
explanation
of
the
primal
ethical
phaenomenon
chapter
i
how
this
appendix
must
be
understood
in
the
foregoing
pages
the
moral
incentive
compassion
has
been
established
as
a
fact
and
i
have
shown
that
from
it
alone
can
proceed
unselfish
justice
and
genuine
and
that
on
these
two
cardinal
virtues
all
the
rest
depend
now
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
ethics
with
a
foundation
this
is
sufficient
in
a
certain
sense
that
is
in
so
far
as
moral
science
necessarily
requires
to
be
supported
by
some
actual
and
demonstrable
basis
whether
existing
in
the
external
world
or
in
the
consciousness
the
only
alternative
is
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
that
so
many
of
my
predecessors
have
left
in
other
words
to
choose
arbitrarily
some
proposition
or
other
some
bare
and
abstract
formula
and
make
it
the
source
of
all
that
morality
prescribes
or
like
kant
to
sublimate
a
mere
idea
that
of
into
the
of
the
ethical
arch
but
dismissing
this
method
for
the
reasons
discussed
above
in
the
second
part
the
investigation
proposed
by
the
royal
society
appears
to
me
now
completed
for
their
question
as
it
stands
deals
only
with
the
foundation
of
ethics
as
to
a
possible
metaphysical
explanation
of
this
foundation
nothing
whatever
is
asked
nevertheless
at
the
point
we
have
reached
i
am
very
sensible
that
the
human
spirit
can
find
no
abiding
satisfaction
no
real
repose
as
in
all
branches
of
practical
research
so
also
in
ethical
science
when
all
is
said
man
is
inevitably
confronted
with
an
ultimate
phaenomenon
which
while
it
renders
an
account
of
everything
that
it
includes
and
everything
deducible
from
it
remains
itself
an
unexplained
riddle
so
that
here
as
elsewhere
the
want
is
felt
of
a
final
interpretation
which
obviously
can
not
but
be
of
the
ultimate
data
as
such
and
through
these
if
they
be
taken
in
their
entirety
of
the
world
and
here
too
this
want
finds
utterance
in
the
question
how
is
it
that
what
is
present
to
our
senses
and
grasped
by
our
intellect
is
as
it
is
and
not
otherwise
and
how
does
the
character
of
the
phaenomenon
as
manifest
to
us
shape
itself
out
of
the
essential
nature
of
things
indeed
in
moral
science
the
need
of
a
metaphysical
basis
is
more
urgent
than
in
any
other
because
all
systems
philosophical
no
less
than
religious
are
at
one
in
persistently
attaching
to
not
only
an
ethical
but
also
a
metaphysical
significance
which
passing
beyond
the
mere
appearance
of
things
transcends
every
possibility
of
experience
and
therefore
stands
in
the
closest
connection
with
human
destiny
and
with
the
whole
cosmic
process
for
if
life
it
is
averred
have
a
meaning
then
the
supreme
goal
to
which
it
points
is
undoubtedly
ethical
nor
is
this
view
a
bare
unsupported
theory
it
is
sufficiently
established
by
the
undeniable
fact
that
as
death
draws
nigh
the
thoughts
of
each
individual
assume
a
moral
trend
equally
whether
he
be
credulous
of
religious
dogmas
or
not
he
is
manifestly
anxious
to
wind
up
the
affairs
of
his
life
now
verging
to
its
end
entirely
from
the
standpoint
in
this
particular
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
is
of
special
value
standing
as
they
do
outside
the
pale
of
christian
influence
i
shall
therefore
here
quote
a
remarkable
passage
preserved
by
stobaeus
in
his
chap
it
has
been
attributed
to
the
earliest
hellenic
lawgiver
zaleucus
though
according
to
bentley
and
heyne
its
source
is
pythagorean
the
language
is
graphic
and
unmistakable

furthermore
to
come
to
an
historical
personage
we
find
pericles
on
his
unwilling
to
hear
anything
about
his
great
achievements
and
only
anxious
to
know
that
he
had
never
brought
trouble
on
a
citizen
plutarch
of
turning
to
modern
times
if
a
very
different
case
may
be
placed
beside
the
preceding
i
remember
having
noticed
in
a
report
of
depositions
made
before
an
english
jury
the
following
occurrence
a
rough
negro
lad
fifteen
years
old
had
been
mortally
injured
in
some
brawl
on
board
a
ship
as
he
was
dying
he
eagerly
begged
that
all
his
companions
might
be
fetched
in
haste
he
wanted
to
ask
if
he
had
ever
vexed
or
insulted
any
one
of
them
and
after
hearing
that
he
had
not
his
mind
appeared
greatly
relieved
it
is
indeed
the
uniform
teaching
of
experience
that
those
near
death
wish
to
be
reconciled
with
every
one
before
they
pass
away
but
there
is
evidence
of
another
kind
that
ethics
can
only
be
finally
explained
by
metaphysics
it
is
well
known
that
while
the
author
of
an
intellectual
performance
even
should
it
be
a
supreme
masterpiece
is
quite
willing
to
take
whatever
remuneration
he
can
get
those
on
the
other
hand
who
have
done
something
morally
excellent
almost
without
exception
refuse
compensation
for
it
the
latter
fact
is
specially
observable
where
conduct
rises
to
the
heroic
for
instance
when
a
man
at
the
risk
of
his
life
has
saved
another
or
perhaps
many
from
destruction
as
a
rule
he
simply
declines
all
reward
poor
though
he
may
be
because
he
instinctively
feels
that
the
metaphysical
value
of
his
act
would
be
thereby
impaired
at
the
end
of
bürger
song
the
brave
man
we
find
a
poetical
presentment
of
this
psychological
process
nor
does
the
reality
for
the
most
part
differ
at
all
from
the
ideal
as
i
have
frequently
noticed
in
english
papers
conduct
of
this
kind
occurs
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
independently
of
all
religious
differences
in
human
beings
there
is
an
undeniable
ethical
tendency
rooted
however
unconsciously
in
metaphysics
and
without
an
explanation
of
life
on
these
lines
no
religion
could
gain
for
it
is
by
virtue
of
their
ethical
side
that
they
all
alike
keep
their
hold
on
the
mind
every
religion
makes
its
body
of
dogmas
the
basis
of
the
moral
incentive
which
each
man
feels
but
which
he
does
not
on
that
account
understand
and
it
unites
the
two
so
closely
that
they
appear
to
be
inseparable
indeed
the
priests
take
special
pains
to
proclaim
unbelief
and
immorality
as
one
and
the
same
thing
the
reason
is
thus
apparent
why
believers
regard
unbelievers
as
identical
with
the
vicious
and
why
expressions
such
as
godless
atheistic
unchristian
heretic
are
used
as
synonymes
for
moral
depravity
the
religions
have
in
fact
a
sufficiently
easy
task
is
the
principle
they
start
from
hence
they
are
in
a
position
to
simply
insist
on
its
application
to
their
dogmas
and
this
even
to
the
point
of
employing
threats
but
philosophy
has
no
such
convenient
instrument
ready
to
hand
if
the
different
systems
be
examined
it
will
be
found
that
the
situation
is
beset
with
difficulties
both
as
regards
the
foundation
to
be
provided
for
ethics
and
in
relation
to
the
point
of
connection
discoverable
in
any
such
foundation
with
the
given
metaphysical
theory
and
yet
as
i
have
emphasised
in
the
introduction
with
an
appeal
to
the
authority
of
wolff
and
kant
we
are
under
the
stringent
necessity
of
obtaining
from
metaphysics
a
support
for
moral
science
now
of
all
the
problems
that
the
human
intellect
has
to
grapple
with
that
of
metaphysics
is
by
far
the
hardest
so
much
so
that
it
is
regarded
by
many
thinkers
as
absolutely
insoluble
apart
from
this
in
the
present
case
i
labour
under
the
special
disadvantage
which
the
form
of
a
detached
monograph
involves
in
other
words
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
start
from
some
definite
metaphysical
system
of
which
i
may
be
an
adherent
because
if
i
did
either
it
would
have
to
be
expounded
in
detail
which
would
take
too
much
space
or
else
there
would
be
the
necessity
of
supposing
it
granted
and
unquestioned
an
exceedingly
precarious
proceeding
the
consequence
is
that
i
am
as
little
able
to
use
the
synthetic
method
here
as
in
the
foregoing
part
analysis
alone
is
possible
that
is
i
must
work
backwards
from
the
effects
to
their
cause
and
not
this
stern
obligation
however
of
having
at
the
outset
no
previous
hypothesis
no
standpoint
other
than
the
commonly
accepted
one
made
the
discovery
of
the
ethical
basis
so
laborious
that
as
i
look
back
upon
the
task
i
seem
to
have
accomplished
some
wondrous
feat
of
dexterity
not
unlike
that
of
a
man
who
executes
with
subtlest
skill
in
mid
air
what
otherwise
is
only
done
on
a
solid
support
but
now
that
we
have
come
to
the
question
whether
there
can
be
given
a
metaphysical
explanation
of
the
foundation
obtained
the
difficulty
of
proceeding
without
any
assumption
becomes
so
enormous
that
but
one
course
appears
to
me
open
namely
to
attempt
nothing
beyond
a
general
sketch
of
the
subject
i
shall
therefore
indicate
rather
than
elaborate
the
line
of
thought
i
shall
point
out
the
way
leading
to
the
goal
but
not
follow
it
thither
in
short
i
shall
present
but
a
very
small
part
of
what
under
other
circumstances
could
be
adduced
in
adopting
this
attitude
for
the
reasons
stated
i
wish
before
beginning
to
emphatically
remark
that
in
any
case
the
actual
problem
put
forward
has
now
been
solved
consequently
that
what
i
here
add
is
an
an
appendix
to
be
given
and
taken
entirely
at
will
we
ought
to
realise
as
if
before
our
eyes
that
moment
of
time
when
the
end
comes
to
each
one
for
deliverance
from
living
because
all
who
are
about
to
die
are
seized
with
repentance
remembering
as
they
do
their
unjust
deeds
and

filled
with

the
metaphysical
groundwork
so
far
all
our
steps
have
been
supported
by
the
firm
rock
of
experience
but
at
this
point
it
fails
us
and
the
solid
earth
sinks
from
under
our
feet
as
we
press
forward
in
our
search
after
a
final
theoretical
satisfaction
there
where
no

can
ever
by

possibility
penetrate

hint
one

may

our
procedure
we
shall
not
make
shift
with
dreams
and
serve
up
fairy
tales
after
the
fashion
of
the
philosophers
nor
shall
we
like
them
seek
by
a
wordy
exuberance
to
impose
upon
the
reader
and
cast
dust
in
his
eyes
a
little
is
all
we
promise
but
that
little
will
be
presented
in
perfect
sincerity
the
principle
which
we
discovered
to
be
the
final
explanation
of
ethics
now
in
turn
itself
requires
explaining
so
that
our
present
problem
has
to
deal
with
that
natural
compassion
which
in
every
man
is
innate
and
indestructible
and
which
has
been
shown
to
be
the
sole
source
of
conduct
this
kind
alone
being
of
real
moral
worth
now
many
modern
thinkers
treat
the
conceptions
of
good
and
bad
as
that
is
as
neither
needing
nor
admitting
any
elucidation
and
then
they
go
on
for
the
most
part
to
talk
very
mysteriously
and
devoutly
of
an
idea
of
the
good
out
of
which
they
make
a
pedestal
for
their
moral
system
or
at
least
a
cloak
for
their
poverty
hence
i
am
obliged
in
this
connection
to
point
out
parenthetically
that
these
conceptions
are
anything
but
much
less
that
they
in
fact
express
a
relation
and
are
derived
from
the
commonest
daily
experience
whatever
is
in
conformity
with
the
desires
of
any
individual
will
is
relatively
to
it
termed
for
instance
good
food
good
roads
a
good
omen
the
contrary
is
called
and
in
the
case
of
living
beings
and
so
one
who
by
virtue
of
his
character
has
no
wish
to
oppose
what
others
strive
after
but
rather
as
far
as
he
reasonably
may
shows
himself
favourable
and
helpful
to
them
one
who
instead
of
injuring
assists
his
neighbours
and
promotes
their
interests
when
he
can
is
named
by
the
latter
in
respect
to
themselves
a
the
term
being
applied
to
him
in
the
sense
of
the
above
definition
and
from
their
own
point
of
view
which
is
thus
relative
empirical
and
centred
in
the
passive
subject
now
if
we
examine
the
nature
of
such
a
man
not
only
as
it
affects
others
but
as
it
is
in
itself
we
are
enabled
by
the
foregoing
exposition
to
perceive
that
the
virtues
of
justice
and
which
he
practises
are
due
to
a
direct
participation
in
weal
and
woe
external
to
himself
and
we
have
learnt
that
the
source
of
such
participation
is
compassion
if
further
we
pause
to
consider
what
is
the
essential
part
in
this
type
of
character
we
shall
certainly
find
it
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
such
a
person
less
distinction
between
himself
and
others
than
is
usually
in
the
eyes
of
the
malicious
individual
this
difference
is
so
great
that
he
takes
direct
delight
in
the
spectacle
of
suffering
a
delight
which
he
accordingly
seeks
without
thought
of
any
other
benefit
to
himself
nay
sometimes
even
to
his
own
hurt
from
the
egoist
point
of
view
the
same
difference
is
still
large
enough
to
make
him
bring
much
trouble
on
his
neighbours
in
order
to
obtain
a
small
personal
advantage
hence
for
both
of
these
between
the
which
is
limited
to
their
own
persons
and
the
which
includes
all
the
rest
of
the
world
there
is
fixed
a
great
gulf
a
mighty
abyss
mundus
dum
ego
salvus
the
world
may
perish
provided
i
be
safe
is
their
maxim
for
the
good
man
on
the
contrary
this
distinction
is
by
no
means
so
pronounced
indeed
in
the
case
of
magnanimous
deeds
it
appears
to
become
a
vanishing
quantity
because
then
the
weal
of
another
is
advanced
at
the
cost
of
the
benefactor
the
self
of
another
placed
on
an
equality
with
his
own
and
when
it
is
a
question
of
saving
a
number
of
total
may
be
developed
the
one
giving
his
life
for
many
the
inquiry
now
presents
itself
whether
the
latter
way
of
looking
at
the
relation
subsisting
between
the
ego
and
the
which
forms
the
mainspring
of
a
good
man
conduct
is
mistaken
and
due
to
an
illusion
or
whether
the
error
does
not
rather
attach
to
the
opposite
view
on
which
egoism
and
malice
are
based
no
doubt
the
theory
lying
at
the
root
of
egoism
is
from
the
perfectly
justified
from
the
testimony
of
experience
the
between
one
own
person
and
that
of
another
appears
to
be
absolute
i
do
not
occupy
the
same
space
as
my
neighbour
and
this
difference
which
separates
me
from
him
physically
separates
me
also
from
his
weal
and
woe
but
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
observed
that
the
knowledge
we
have
of
our
own
selves
is
by
no
means
exhaustive
and
transparent
to
its
depths
by
means
of
the
intuition
which
the
brain
constructs
out
of
the
data
supplied
by
the
senses
that
is
to
say
in
an
indirect
manner
we
recognise
our
body
as
an
object
in
space
through
an
inward
perception
we
are
aware
of
the
continuous
series
of
our
desires
of
our
volitions
which
arise
through
the
agency
of
external
motives
and
finally
we
come
to
discern
the
manifold
movements
now
stronger
now
weaker
of
our
will
itself
to
which
all
feelings
from
within
are
ultimately
traceable
and
that
is
all
the
perceiving
faculty
is
not
in
its
turn
on
the
contrary
the
real
substratum
of
our
whole
phaenomenal
nature
our
inmost
essence
in
itself
that
which
wills
and
perceives
is
not
accessible
to
us
we
see
only
the
outward
side
of
the
ego
its
inward
part
is
veiled
in
darkness
consequently
the
knowledge
we
possess
of
ourselves
is
in
no
sort
radical
and
complete
but
rather
very
superficial
the
larger
and
more
important
part
of
our
being
remains
unknown
and
forms
a
riddle
to
speculate
about
or
as
kant
puts
it
the
ego
knows
itself
only
as
a
phaenomenon
of
its
real
essence
whatever
that
may
be
it
has
no
knowledge
now
as
regards
that
side
of
the
self
which
falls
within
our
ken
we
are
undoubtedly
sharply
distinguished
each
from
the
other
but
it
does
not
follow
therefrom
that
the
same
is
true
of
the
remainder
which
shrouded
in
impenetrable
obscurity
is
yet
in
fact
the
very
substance
of
which
we
consist
there
remains
at
least
the
possibility
that
the
latter
is
in
all
men
uniform
and
identical
what
is
the
explanation
of
all
plurality
of
all
numerical
diversity
of
existence
time
and
space
indeed
it
is
only
through
the
latter
that
the
former
is
possible
because
the
concept
many
inevitably
connotes
the
idea
either
of
succession
time
or
of
relative
position
space
now
since
a
homogeneous
plurality
is
composed
of
i
call
space
and
time
as
being
the
conditions
of
multiplicity
the
the
principle
of
individuation
and
i
do
not
here
pause
to
consider
whether
this
expression
was
exactly
so
employed
by
the
schoolmen
if
in
the
disclosures
which
kant
wonderful
acumen
gave
to
the
world
there
is
anything
true
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
transcendental
aesthetics
that
is
to
say
in
his
doctrine
of
the
ideality
of
space
and
time
on
such
solid
foundations
is
the
structure
built
that
no
one
has
been
able
to
raise
even
an
apparent
objection
it
is
kant
triumph
and
belongs
to
the
very
small
number
of
metaphysical
theories
which
may
be
regarded
as
really
proved
and
as
actual
conquests
in
that
field
of
research
it
teaches
us
that
space
and
time
are
the
forms
of
our
own
faculty
of
intuition
to
which
they
consequently
belong
and
not
to
the
objects
thereby
perceived
and
further
that
they
can
in
no
way
be
a
condition
of
things
in
themselves
but
rather
attach
only
to
their
mode
of
such
as
is
alone
possible
for
us
who
have
a
consciousness
of
the
external
world
determined
by
strictly
physiological
limits
now
if
to
the
thing
in
itself
that
is
to
the
reality
underlying
the
kosmos
as
we
perceive
it
time
and
space
are
foreign
so
also
must
multiplicity
be
consequently
that
which
is
objectivated
in
the
countless
phaenomena
of
this
world
of
the
senses
can
not
but
be
a
unity
a
single
indivisible
entity
manifested
in
each
and
all
of
them
and
conversely
the
web
of
plurality
woven
in
the
loom
of
time
and
space
is
not
the
thing
in
itself
but
only
its
externally
to
the
thinking
subject
this
as
such
has
no
existence
it
is
merely
an
attribute
of
our
consciousness
bounded
as
the
latter
is
by
manifold
conditions
indeed
depending
on
an
organic
function
the
view
of
things
as
above
stated
that
all
plurality
is
only
apparent
that
in
the
endless
series
of
individuals
passing
simultaneously
and
successively
into
and
out
of
life
generation
after
generation
age
after
age
there
is
but
one
and
the
same
entity
really
existing
which
is
present
and
identical
in
all
alike
this
theory
i
say
was
of
course
known
long
before
kant
indeed
it
may
be
carried
back
to
the
remotest
antiquity
it
is
the
alpha
and
omega
of
the
oldest
book
in
the
world
the
sacred
whose
dogmatic
part
or
rather
esoteric
teaching
is
found
in
the
there
in
almost
every
page
this
profound
doctrine
lies
enshrined
with
tireless
repetition
in
countless
adaptations
by
many
varied
parables
and
similes
it
is
expounded
and
inculcated
that
such
was
moreover
the
fount
whence
pythagoras
drew
his
wisdom
can
not
be
doubted
despite
the
scanty
knowledge
we
possess
of
what
he
taught
that
it
formed
practically
the
central
point
in
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
eleatic
school
is
likewise
a
familiar
fact
later
on
the
new
platonists
were
steeped
in
the
same
one
of
their
chief
tenets
being
τὴν
ἑνότητα
ἀπάντων
πάσας
ψuχὰς
mίαν
all
souls
are
one
because
all
things
form
a
unity
in
the
ninth
century
we
find
it
unexpectedly
appearing
in
europe
it
kindles
the
spirit
of
no
less
a
divine
than
johannes
scotus
erigena
who
endeavours
to
clothe
it
with
the
forms
and
terminology
of
the
christian
religion
among
the
mohammedans
we
detect
it
again
in
the
rapt
mysticism
of
the
in
the
west
giordano
bruno
can
not
resist
the
impulse
to
utter
it
aloud
but
his
reward
is
a
death
of
shame
and
torture
and
at
the
same
time
we
find
the
christian
mystics
losing
themselves
in
it
against
their
own
will
and
intention
whenever
and
wherever
we
read
of
them
spinoza
name
is
identified
with
it
lastly
in
our
own
days
after
kant
had
annihilated
the
old
dogmatism
and
the
world
stood
aghast
at
its
smoking
ruins
the
same
teaching
was
revived
in
schelling
eclectic
philosophy
the
latter
took
all
the
systems
of
plotinus
spinoza
kant
and
jacob
boehm
and
mixing
them
together
with
the
results
of
modern
natural
science
speedily
served
up
a
dish
sufficient
to
satisfy
for
the
moment
the
pressing
needs
of
his
contemporaries
and
then
proceeded
to
perform
a
series
of
variations
on
the
original
theme
the
consequence
is
that
in
the
learned
circles
of
germany
this
line
of
thought
has
come
to
be
generally
accepted
indeed
even
among
people
of
ordinary
education
it
is
almost
universally
diffused
a
solitary
exception
is
formed
by
the
university
philosophers
of
the
present
day
they
have
the
hard
task
of
fighting
what
is
called
being
brought
through
the
stress
of
battle
into
great
embarrassment
and
difficulty
they
anxiously
catch
now
at
the
most
pitiful
sophisms
now
at
phrases
of
choicest
bombast
so
only
they
may
patch
together
some
sort
of
respectable
disguise
wherein
to
dress
up
the
favourite
petticoat
philosophy
that
has
duly
received
official
sanction
in
a
word
the
καὶ
has
been
in
all
ages
the
of
fools
for
the
wise
a
subject
of
perpetual
meditation
nevertheless
the
strict
demonstration
of
this
theory
is
only
to
be
obtained
from
the
kantian
teaching
as
i
have
just
shown
kant
himself
did
not
carry
it
out
after
the
fashion
of
clever
orators
he
only
gave
the
premises
leaving
to
his
hearers
the
pleasure
of
drawing
the
conclusion
now
if
plurality
and
difference
belong
only
to
the
if
there
is
but
one
and
the
same
entity
manifested
in
all
living
things
it
follows
that
when
we
obliterate
the
distinction
between
the
and
the
we
are
not
the
sport
of
an
illusion
rather
are
we
so
when
we
maintain
the
reality
of
individuation
a
thing
the
hindus
call
that
is
a
deceptive
vision
a
phantasma
the
former
theory
we
have
found
to
be
the
actual
source
of
the
phaenomenon
of
compassion
indeed
compassion
is
nothing
but
its
translation
into
definite
expression
this
therefore
is
what
i
should
regard
as
the
metaphysical
foundation
of
ethics
and
should
describe
it
as
the
sense
which
identifies
the
with
the
so
that
the
individual
directly
recognises
in
another
his
own
self
his
true
and
very
being
from
this
standpoint
the
profoundest
teaching
of
theory
pushed
to
its
furthest
limits
may
be
shown
in
the
end
to
harmonise
perfectly
with
the
rules
of
justice
and
as
exercised
and
conversely
it
will
be
clear
that
practical
philosophers
that
is
the
upright
the
beneficent
the
magnanimous
do
but
declare
through
their
acts
the
same
truth
as
the
man
of
speculation
wins
by
laborious
research
by
the
loftiest
flights
of
intellect
meanwhile
moral
excellence
stands
higher
than
all
theoretical
sapience
the
latter
is
at
best
nothing
but
a
very
unfinished
and
partial
structure
and
only
by
the
circuitous
path
of
reasoning
attains
the
goal
which
the
former
reaches
in
one
step
he
who
is
morally
noble
however
deficient
in
mental
penetration
reveals
by
his
conduct
the
deepest
insight
the
truest
wisdom
and
puts
to
shame
the
most
accomplished
and
learned
genius
if
the
latter
acts
betray
that
his
heart
is
yet
a
stranger
to
this
great
principle
the
metaphysical
unity
of
life
individuation
is
real
the
individuationis
with
the
consequent
distinction
of
individuals
is
the
order
of
things
in
themselves
bach
living
unit
is
an
entity
radically
different
from
all
others
in
my
own
self
alone
i
have
my
true
being
everything
outside
it
belongs
to
the
and
is
foreign
to
me
this
is
the
creed
to
the
truth
of
which
flesh
and
bone
bear
witness
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
egoism
and
which
finds
its
objective
expression
in
every
loveless
unjust
or
malicious
act
individuation
is
merely
an
appearance
born
of
space
and
time
the
latter
being
nothing
else
than
the
forms
under
which
the
external
world
necessarily
manifests
itself
to
me
conditioned
as
they
are
by
my
brain
faculty
of
perception
hence
also
the
plurality
and
difference
of
individuals
is
but
a
that
is
exists
only
as
my
mental
picture
my
true
inmost
being
subsists
in
every
living
thing
just
as
really
as
directly
as
in
my
own
consciousness
it
is
evidenced
only
to
myself
this
is
the
higher
knowledge
for
which
there
is
in
sanskrit
the
standing
formula
tvam
that
art
thou
out
of
the
depths
of
human
nature
it
wells
up
in
the
shape
of
compassion
and
is
therefore
the
source
of
all
genuine
that
is
disinterested
virtue
being
so
to
say
incarnate
in
every
good
deed
it
is
this
which
in
the
last
resort
is
invoked
whenever
we
appeal
to
gentleness
to
whenever
we
pray
for
mercy
instead
of
justice
for
such
appeal
such
prayer
is
in
reality
the
effort
to
remind
a
of
the
ultimate
truth
that
we
are
all
one
and
the
same
entity
on
the
other
hand
egoism
and
its
derivatives
envy
hatred
the
spirit
of
persecution
hardness
of
heart
revenge
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
suffering
and
cruelty
all
claim
support
from
the
other
view
of
things
and
seek
their
justification
in
it
the
emotion
and
joy
we
experience
when
we
hear
of
still
more
when
we
see
and
most
of
all
when
we
ourselves
do
a
noble
act
are
at
bottom
traceable
to
the
feeling
of
certainty
such
a
deed
gives
that
beyond
all
plurality
and
distinction
of
individuals
which
the
like
a
kaleidoscope
shows
us
in
evanescent
forms
there
is
an
underlying
unity
not
only
truly
existing
but
actually
accessible
to
us
for
lo
in
tangible
objective
form
it
stands
before
our
sight
of
these
two
mental
attitudes
according
as
the
one
or
the
other
is
adopted
so
the
love
or
the
hatred
of
empedocles
appears
between
man
and
man
if
any
one
who
is
animated
by
could
forcibly
break
in
upon
his
most
detested
foe
and
compel
him
to
lay
bare
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
heart
to
his
surprise
he
would
find
again
in
the
latter
his
very
self
for
just
as
in
dreams
all
the
persons
that
appear
to
us
are
but
the
masked
images
of
ourselves
so
in
the
dream
of
our
waking
life
it
is
our
own
being
which
looks
on
us
from
out
our
neighbours
eyes
though
this
is
not
equally
easy
to
discern
nevertheless
tvam
the
preponderance
of
either
mode
of
viewing
life
not
only
determines
single
acts
it
shapes
a
man
whole
nature
and
temperament
hence
the
radical
difference
of
mental
habit
between
the
character
and
the
the
latter
feels
everywhere
that
a
thick
wall
of
partition
hedges
him
off
from
all
others
for
him
the
world
is
an
and
his
relation
to
it
an
essentially
hostile
one
consequently
the
of
his
disposition
is
hatred
suspicion
envy
and
pleasure
in
seeing
distress
the
good
character
on
the
other
hand
lives
in
an
external
world
homogeneous
with
his
own
being
the
rest
of
mankind
is
not
in
his
eyes
a
he
thinks
of
it
rather
as
myself
once
more
he
therefore
stands
on
an
essentially
amicable
footing
with
every
one
he
is
conscious
of
being
in
his
inmost
nature
akin
to
the
whole
human
race
takes
direct
interest
in
their
weal
and
woe
and
confidently
assumes
in
their
case
the
same
interest
in
him
this
is
the
source
of
his
deep
inward
peace
and
of
that
happy
calm
contented
manner
which
goes
out
on
those
around
him
and
is
as
the
presence
of
a
good
diffused
whereas
the
bad
character
in
time
of
trouble
has
no
trust
in
the
help
of
his
if
he
invokes
aid
he
does
so
without
confidence
obtained
he
feels
no
real
gratitude
for
it
because
he
can
hardly
discern
therein
anything
but
the
effect
of
others
folly
for
he
is
simply
incapable
of
recognising
his
own
self
in
some
one
else
and
this
even
after
it
has
furnished
the
most
incontestible
signs
of
existence
in
that
other
person
on
which
fact
the
repulsive
nature
of
all
unthankfulness
in
reality
depends
the
moral
isolation
which
thus
naturally
and
inevitably
encompasses
the
bad
man
is
often
the
cause
of
his
becoming
the
victim
of
despair
the
good
man
on
the
contrary
will
appeal
to
his
neighbours
for
assistance
with
an
assurance
equal
to
the
consciousness
he
has
of
being
ready
himself
to
help
them
as
i
have
said
to
the
one
type
humanity
is
a
to
the
other
myself
once
more
the
magnanimous
character
who
forgives
his
enemy
and
returns
good
for
evil
rises
to
the
sublime
and
receives
the
highest
meed
of
praise
because
he
recognises
his
real
self
even
there
where
it
is
most
conspicuously
disowned
every
purely
beneficent
act
all
help
entirely
and
genuinely
unselfish
being
as
such
exclusively
inspired
by
another
distress
is
in
fact
if
we
probe
the
matter
to
the
bottom
a
dark
enigma
a
piece
of
mysticism
put
into
practice
inasmuch
as
it
springs
out
of
and
finds
its
only
true
explanation
in
the
same
higher
knowledge
that
constitutes
the
essence
of
whatever
is
mystical
for
how
otherwise
than
metaphysically
are
we
to
account
for
even
the
smallest
offering
of
alms
made
with
absolutely
no
other
object
than
that
of
lessening
the
want
which
afflicts
a
such
an
act
is
only
conceivable
only
possible
in
so
far
as
the
giver
that
it
is
his
very
self
which
stands
before
him
clad
in
the
garments
of
suffering
in
other
words
so
far
as
he
recognises
the
essential
part
of
his
own
being
under
a
form
not
his
it
now
becomes
apparent
why
in
the
foregoing
part
i
have
called
compassion
the
great
mystery
of
ethics
he
who
goes
to
meet
death
for
his
fatherland
has
freed
himself
from
the
illusion
which
limits
a
man
existence
to
his
own
person
such
a
one
has
broken
the
fetters
of
the
in
his
widened
enlightened
nature
he
embraces
all
his
countrymen
and
in
them
lives
on
and
on
nay
he
reaches
forward
to
and
merges
himself
in
the
generations
yet
unborn
for
whom
he
works
and
he
regards
death
as
a
wink
of
the
eyelids
so
momentary
that
it
does
not
interrupt
the
sight
we
may
here
sum
up
the
characteristics
of
the
two
human
types
above
indicated
to
the
egoist
all
other
people
are
uniformly
and
intrinsically
strangers
in
point
of
fact
he
considers
nothing
to
be
truly
real
except
his
own
person
and
regards
the
rest
of
mankind
practically
as
troops
of
phantoms
to
whom
he
assigns
merely
a
relative
existence
so
far
as
they
may
be
instruments
to
serve
or
barriers
to
obstruct
his
purposes
the
result
being
an
immeasurable
difference
a
vast
gulf
between
on
the
one
side
and
the
on
the
other
in
a
word
he
lives
exclusively
centred
in
his
own
individuality
and
on
his
he
sees
all
reality
indeed
the
whole
world
coming
to
an
end
along
with
himself
whereas
the
altruist
discerns
in
all
other
persons
nay
in
every
living
thing
his
own
entity
and
feels
therefore
that
his
being
is
commingled
is
identical
with
the
being
of
whatever
is
alive
by
death
he
loses
only
a
small
part
of
himself
patting
off
the
narrow
limitations
of
the
individual
he
passes
into
the
larger
life
of
all
mankind
in
whom
he
always
recognised
and
recognising
loved
his
very
self
and
the
illusion
of
time
and
space
which
separated
his
consciousness
from
that
of
others
vanishes
these
two
opposite
modes
of
viewing
the
world
are
probably
the
chief
though
not
indeed
the
sole
cause
of
the
difference
we
find
between
very
good
and
exceptionally
bad
men
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
meet
their
last
hour
in
all
ages
truth
poor
thing
has
been
put
to
shame
for
being
paradoxical
and
yet
it
is
not
her
fault
she
can
not
assume
the
form
of
error
seated
on
his
throne
of
sovereignty
so
then
with
a
sigh
she
looks
up
to
her
tutelary
god
time
who
nods
assurance
to
her
of
future
victory
and
glory
but
whose
wings
beat
the
air
so
slowly
with
their
mighty
strokes
that
the
individual
perishes
or
ever
the
day
of
triumph
be
come
hence
i
too
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
paradox
which
this
metaphysical
explanation
of
the
ultimate
ethical
phaenomenon
must
present
to
western
minds
accustomed
as
they
are
to
very
different
methods
of
providing
morals
with
a
basis
nevertheless
i
can
not
offer
violence
to
the
truth
all
that
is
possible
for
me
to
do
out
of
consideration
for
european
blindness
is
to
assert
once
more
and
demonstrate
by
actual
quotation
that
the
metaphysics
of
ethics
which
i
have
here
suggested
was
thousands
of
years
ago
the
fundamental
principle
of
indian
wisdom
and
to
this
wisdom
i
point
back
as
copernicus
did
to
the
pythagorean
cosmic
system
which
was
suppressed
by
aristotle
and
ptolemaeus
in
the
bhagavadgîtâ
lectio
xiii
according
to
von
schlegel
translation
we
find
the
following
passage
in
omnibus
animantibus
consistentem
summum
dominum
istis
pereuntibus
kaud
pereuntem
qui
cernit
is
vere
cernit
eundem
vero
cernens
ubique
praesentem
dominum
non
violat
semet
ipsum
sua
ipsius
culpa
exinde
pergit
ad
summum
with
these
hints
towards
the
elaboration
of
a
metaphysical
basis
for
ethics
i
must
close
although
an
important
step
still
remains
to
be
taken
the
latter
would
presuppose
a
further
advance
in
moral
science
itself
and
this
can
hardly
be
made
because
in
the
west
the
highest
aim
of
ethics
is
reached
in
the
theory
of
justice
and
virtue
what
lies
beyond
is
unknown
or
at
any
rate
ignored
the
omission
therefore
is
unavoidable
and
the
reader
need
feel
no
surprise
if
the
above
slight
outline
of
the
metaphysics
of
ethics
does
not
bring
into
view
even
remotely
the
of
the
whole
metaphysical
edifice
nor
reveal
the
connection
of
all
the
parts
composing
the
such
a
presentment
moreover
is
involved
neither
in
the
question
set
nor
in
my
own
plan
a
man
can
not
say
everything
in
one
day
and
should
not
answer
more
than
he
is
asked
he
who
tries
to
promote
human
knowledge
and
insight
is
destined
to
always
encounter
the
opposition
of
his
age
which
is
like
the
dead
weight
of
some
mass
that
has
to
be
dragged
along
there
on
the
ground
it
lies
a
huge
inert
deformity
defying
all
efforts
to
quicken
its
shape
with
new
life
but
such
a
one
must
take
comfort
from
the
certainty
that
although
prejudices
beset
his
path
yet
the
truth
is
with
him
and
truth
does
but
wait
for
her
ally
time
to
join
her
once
he
is
at
her
side
she
is
perfectly
sure
of
victory
which
if
delayed
will
be
won
the
conception
of
in
its
purity
is
an
one

whose
substance
loses
itself

p
it
is
obvious
that
this
writer
would
like
to
transform
the
familiar
nay
trivial
conception
into
a
sort
of
to
be
set
up
as
an
idol
in
his
temple
fallen
from

and
so
a
thing
of
divine
origin

ground

marginal

were
added

copyists

interpolated

text

has
however
been
fully
established
by
the
sanskrit
scholar
windischmann

in
his

based
on
a
thorough
and
exact
knowledge
of
the

has
only
to
compare
it
with
recent
translations
of
some
of
the
upanishads
by
rammohun

by
poley

especially
with

with

are
obviously
groping
in
obscurity
and
driven
to
make
shift
with
hazy
conjectures
so
that
without
doubt
their
work
is
much
less
accurate

will
be

on

the
fountain
and

of
morals
to
be
sought
for
in
an
idea
of
morality
which
lies
directly
in
the
consciousness

and
in
the
analysis
of
the
other
leading
ethical
conceptions
which
arise
from
it
or
is
it
to

source
of
knowledge
there
was
only
one
competitor
but
his
dissertation
written
in

and
bearing
the
motto

morality
is
easy
to
found
it
is
we
can
not
adjudge
worthy
of
the
prize
he
has
omitted
to
deal
with
the
essential
part
of
the
question
apparently
thinking
that
he
was
asked
to
establish
some
fundamental
principle
of
ethics
consequently
that
part
of
the
treatise
which
explains
how
the
moral
basis
he
proposes
is
related
to
his
system
of
metaphysics
we
find
relegated
to
an
appendix
as
an
although
it
was
precisely
the
connection
between
metaphysics
and
ethics
that
our
question
required
to
be
put
in
the
first
and
foremost
place
the
writer
attempts
to
show
that
compassion
is
the
ultimate
source
of
morality
but
neither
does
his
mode
of
discussion
appear
satisfactory
to
us
nor
has
he
in
point
of
fact
succeeded
in
proving
that
such
a
foundation
is
adequate
indeed
he
himself
is
obliged
to
admit
that
it
is
not
lastly
the
society
can
not
pass
over
in
silence
the
fact
that
he
mentions
several
recent
