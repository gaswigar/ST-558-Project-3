trailed
off

cheek
since

had
come
home
and
was
by
her
side
holding
her
hand
the
pounded
toes
were
thrust
out
before
her
tied
up
in
an
old
cloth
and
waiting
for
the
wormwood
which
was
steeping
on
the
fire
grandma
bascom
protesting
that
soon
phronsie
wouldn
t
know
that
she
had
any
toes
sank
into
a
chair
and
beamed
at

you
pretty
creeter

joel
burrowing
on
the
floor
his
head
in
polly
s
lap
where
her
soft
fingers
could
smooth
his
stubby
black
hair
sh
said
polly
with
a
warning
pinch
go
on
begged
davie
hanging
over
her
chair
intent
as
phronsie
on
the
fate
of
the
white
chicken
did
she
go
in
polly
did
she
phronsie
sat
still
her
eyes
on
polly
s
face
her
fat
little
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
while
she
held
her
breath
for
the
answer
dear
me
yes
cried
polly
quickly
she
stretched
her
neck
like
this
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
for
polly
always
acted
out
as
much
as
she
could
all
her
stories
particularly
on
emergencies
like
the
present
one
and
peered
around
the
corner
susan
wasn
t
there
for
she
was
up
at
the
house
sitting
on
a
stool
and
sewing
patchwork
but
there
was
a
black
object
over
in
the
corner
and
oh
you
pretty
creeter
you
exclaimed
grandma
suddenly
at
phronsie
on
whom
she
had
gazed
unceasingly
so
you
did
pound
your
toes
there
there
you
pretty
creeter
ugh
ugh
make
her
stop
howled
joel
twitching
up
his
head
from
its
soft
nest
oh
dear
we
can
t
hear
anything
stop
her
polly
joel
said
polly
hush
this
minute
just
think
how
good
she
s
been
and
the
raisins
o
joey
they
are
dreadful
hard
grumbled
joel
but
he
slipped
his
head
back
on
polly
s
lap
wishing
her
fingers
would
smooth
his
hair
again
but
they
didn
t
so
he
burrowed
deeper
and
tried
not
to
cry
meanwhile
phronsie
with
a
troubled
expression
settling
over
her
face
at
this
condition
of
things
made
as
though
she
would
slip
from
the
old
chair
take
me
polly
she
begged
holding
out
her
arms
oh
no
you
mustn
t
you
pretty
creeter
declared
grandma
getting
out
of
her
chair
to
waddle
over
to
the
scene
her
trembling
violently
you
ll
hurt
your
toes
you
must
set
where
you
be
till
you
get
the
wormwood
and
davie
running
over
to
put
his
arms
around
phronsie
and
beg
her
to
keep
still
the
little
old
kitchen
soon
became
in
great
confusion
till
it
seemed
as
if
the
white
chicken
must
be
left
for
all
time
peering
in
at
susan
s
playhouse
and
the
black
object
in
the
corner
oh
dear
me
cried
polly
at
her
wit
s
end
now
you
see
joey
whatever
shall
i
do
take
me
polly
implored
phronsie
leaning
out
of
the
big
chair
at
the
imminent
danger
of
falling
on
her
nose
and
two
tears
raced
over
her
round
cheeks
at
sight
of
these
polly
suddenly
lifted
her
out
and
over
to
her
lap
joel
deserting
that
post
in
a
trice
and
wishing
he
was
phronsie
so
that
he
could
cry
and
be
comforted
illustration
take
me
polly
implored
phronsie
dear
dear
dear
exclaimed
grandma
bascom
gustily
trotting
off
to
the
tin
cup
with
the
wormwood
steeping
on
the
stove
she
must
have
the
wormwood
on
whatever
ll
become
of
her
toes
if
she
don
t
set
still
i
d
no
there
there
she
s
a
pretty
i
don
t
want
any
on
said
phronsie
from
her
nest
in
polly
s
arms
and
contentedly
snuggling
down
please
don
t
let
her
put
any
on
polly
she
whispered
up
against
her
neck
i
ll
put
it
on
said
polly
soothingly
well
now
phronsie
patting
the
yellow
head
and
with
an
anxious
look
up
at
the
old
clock
you
know
i
can
t
bake
mamsie
s
birthday
cake
unless
you
have
that
wormwood
on
and
sit
in
her
chair
like
a
good
girl
and
then
think
how
very
dreadful
it
would
be
to
have
mamsie
come
home
and
it
shouldn
t
be
done
oh
i
can
t
think
of
such
a
thing
polly
s
hand
dropped
away
from
the
yellow
hair
and
fell
to
her
lap
as
she
sat
quite
still
phronsie
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
her
i
ll
have
the
wet
stuff
on
polly
and
sit
in
the
chair
she
said
with
a
long
sigh
lift
me
back
polly
do
then
you
can
bake
mamsie
s
so
phronsie
was
lifted
back
with
great
ado
polly
kissing
her
many
times
and
telling
her
how
glad
she
would
be
on
the
morrow
when
mamsie
s
birthday
cake
would
be
a
beautiful
success
and
how
happy
mamsie
would
be
to
know
that
phronsie
helped
to
bake
it
by
being
such
a
good
girl
and
the
little
toes
were
wet
with
the
wormwood
and
tied
up
in
an
old
cloth
and
grandma
bascom
dropping
the
tin
cup
which
she
was
bearing
back
to
the
stove
with
a
clatter
on
the
floor
created
such
a
diversion
as
polly
and
the
boys
ran
to
get
cloths
and
spoons
to
save
the
precious
wormwood
and
wipe
the
floor
clean
that
the
little
old
kitchen
rang
with
the
noise
and
it
was
some
time
before
polly
could
get
it
quieted
down
again
at
last
polly
drew
a
long
breath
well
now
children
if
you
ll
be
very
still
i
ll
tell
you
the
rest
about
the
white
chicken
while
i
m
making
mamsie
s
cake
and
i
ll
pull
your
chair
phronsie
up
to
the
table
so
you
can
see
let

screamed
joel
hopping
up
to
lay
hasty
hands
on
the
old
rocker
i
want

pull
it
i
want
to
begged
david
just
as
nimble
on
the
other
side
so
you
shall
you
can
both
help
cried
polly
merrily
deep
in
thought
over
the
intricacies
of
mirandy
s
weddin
well
said
grandma
seeing
phronsie
on
such
a
high
road
to
recovery
i
m
dretful
glad
i
found
that
receet
i
put
it
in
my
bible
so
s
to
have
it
handy
to
give
john
s
folks
when
they
come
they
set
great
store
by
it
to
the
weddin
and
i
must
go
home
now
cause
i
left
some
meat
so
off
she
waddled
joel
going
to
the
door
and
gallantly
assisting
her
down
the
steps
and
to
the
gate
glad
to
make
amends
then
he
rushed
back
now
for
the
white
chicken
he
cried
drawing
a
long
breath
and
perching
on
the
end
of
the
yes
said
polly
but
you
ve
got
to
have
on
one
of
mamsie
s
old
slippers
first
oh
ho
phronsie
laughed
gleefully
how
funny
so
one
of
mamsie
s
old
cloth
slippers
was
tied
on
to
phronsie
s
little
foot
with
a
bit
of
string
through
the
middle
the
children
one
and
all
protesting
that
it
looked
like
an
old
black
and
polly
began
again
now
she
said
absently
i
ll
tell
you
about
the
little
white
chicken
just
as
soon
as
i
have
oh
dear
me
let
me
see
if
i
have
all
my
things
she
wrinkled
her
brows
and
thought
a
minute
joel
kicked
his
heels
impatiently
against
the
while
davie
clasped
his
hands
tight
so
as
not
to
say
anything
to
worry
polly
yes
i
believe
they
re
all
here
said
polly
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
the
children
well
there
now
children
i
m
ready
to
begin
on
the
story
oh
let
me
see
all
but
the
big
bowl
and
she
ran
into
the
buttery
and
brought
it
out
and
began
to
mix
the
cake
with
quite
an
important
air
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
of
delight
that
ended
in
a
happy
little
crow
you
must
know
that
the
white
chicken
made
up
her
mind
that
she
go
into
susan
s
playhouse
although
you
told
that
interrupted
joel
filliping
at
the
dish
where
the
raisins
with
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
flour
lay
ready
to
lend
their
magnificence
to
mamsie
s
birthday
cake
go
on
where
you
left
off
you
said
she
saw
a
black
object
over
in
the
corner
said
davie
with
big
eyes
tell
about
oh
yes
so
i
did
said
polly
now
joe
you
mustn
t
touch
the
raisins
every
single
one
must
go
into
mamsie
s
joel
drew
away
his
hand
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
regard
the
plate
on
which
he
kept
his
gaze
fastened
well
in
crept
the
little
white
chicken
said
polly
tragically
and
stirring
briskly
the
with
the
long
wooden
spoon
hoping
the
black
object
wouldn
t
see
her
she
had
to
go
in
you
see
because
just
outside
the
door
coming
under
the
was
a
noise
and
it
sounded
very
much
like
a
boy
and
the
little
white
chicken
had
rather
be
scared
by
a
black
object
in
the
corner
inside
than
to
let
that
boy
spy
her
so
she
crept
in
and
was
just
beginning
to
tuck
up
her
feet
and
sit
down
behind
the
door
when
the
black
object
stirred
and
over
went
the
little
white
chicken
all
in
a
joel
gave
a
grunt
of
great
satisfaction
and
tore
his
eyes
from
the
what
was
it
gasped
davie
fearfully
and
getting
nearer
to
polly
s
side
phronsie
kept
her
wide
eyes
on
polly
s
face
and
sat
quite
still
her
little
hands
folded
in
her
lap
you
wait
and
see
said
polly
gayly
and
stirring
away
for
dear
life
well
over
went
the
little
white
chicken
and
you
said
that
interrupted
joel
do
hurry
and
tell
the
then
she
shut
her
eyes
just
like
this
polly
stopped
stirring
and
turned
to
phronsie
wrinkling
up
her
face
as
much
like
a
chicken
in
despair
as
was
possible
oh
you
can
t
think
how
she
felt
she
was
frightened
she
tried
to
call
her
mother
but
the
peep
peep
that
always
used
to
be
so
loud
and
clear
stuck
way
down
in
her
throat
and
then
she
knew
she
never
in
all
this
world
could
make
her
mother
hear
because
she
hadn
t
minded
her
and
outside
she
could
hear
old
hen
calling
her
brothers
and
sisters
to
come
and
get
the
worms
she
had
just
scratched
and
wouldn
t
the
little
white
chicken
ever
get
a
worm
broke
out
phronsie
in
dreadful
excitement
wouldn
t
she
polly
ever
no
oh
yes
she
could
when
she
was
good

o
joel
reproved
polly
stirring
away
whoever
would
want

little
white
chicken

than
for

boy
to

her
bad
enough
to
be
scared
and
have
the
awful
black
thing
be
a
bear
and
most
bite
her
to
death
and
chew
her

cried
joel
feeling
delicious
thrills
at
the
dreadful
possibilities
that

begged
phronsie
and
she
put
up
her
lip
while
the
brown
eyes
were
imploringly
fixed
on
polly
s
face
joel
squirmed
all
over
the
just
such
a
little
bear
he
remonstrated
hoh
he
couldn
t
bite

i
d
just
as

phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
decidedly
i
don
t
want
him
to
bite
her
any
poor
little
white
chicken
and
she
looked
so
very
near
to
crying
and
mamsie
s
old
black
slipper
on
the
pounded
toes
began
to
flap
so
dismally
that
polly
hastened
to
say
oh

have
tommy
come

oh
whickety
whooped
joel
david
clasped
his
hands
ecstatically
this
was
much
better
to
have
tommy
and
the
bear
than
the
bear
and
the
little
white
chicken
phronsie
laughed
delightedly
make
him
come
quick
do
polly
she
screamed
hurry

joel
o

on
polly
stirring
away
for
dear
life
that
when
susan
went
into
the
house
to
sit
on
the
stool
and
do
patchwork
her
brother
tommy
thought
he
would
take
his
gun
and
see
if
he
could
find
anything
to
shoot
like
rabbits
and
no
no
cried
joel
in
alarm
twitching
her
sleeve
bears
bears
he
didn
t
expect
to
see
a
bear
said
polly
he
went
out
to
shoot
rabbits
but
he
found
the
bear
instead
you
know
catching
sight
of
joel
s
face
which
immediately
cleared
up
and
he
settled
back
contentedly
well
tommy
went
along
by
old
mother
hen
clucking
and
scratching
and
all
the
rest
of
the
chickens
except
the
little
white
one
and
just
as
he
was
going
by
susan
s
playhouse
he
thought
he
would
look
in
and
scare
the
dolls
with
his
big
don
t
let
him
polly
begged
phronsie
in
a
worse
fright
than
before
oh
don
t
let
him
don
t
let
him
ow
there
ain
t
any
fun
phron
keeps
stopping
us
all
the
time
howled
joel
let
him
polly
gee
whiz
bang
that
s
the
way
i
d
do
bringing
an
imaginary
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
blazing
away
well
then
he
d
have
scared
the
bear
so
he
couldn
t
have
shot
him
said
little
davie
quietly
so
he
would
davie
said
polly
approvingly
and
dropping
the
spoon
to
pet
phronsie
if
joel
had
been
there
the
bear
would
have
got
joel
much
discomfited
at
this
ducked
suddenly
and
looked
sheepish
well
go
on
he
said
and
tommy
didn
t
scare
the
dolls
because
you
see
he
was
scared
himself
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
little
white
chicken
crouched
down
like
down
went
polly
on
the
old
kitchen
floor
and
made
herself
so
much
like
a
little
white
chicken
very
much
frightened
that
the
children
held
their
breath
to
see
her
and
then
tommy
looked
at
what
scared
the
little
white
chicken
went
on
polly
hopping
up
and
beginning
to
stir
the
again
and
he
the
illustration
and
he
saw
the
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
this
statement
had
on
the
old
kitchen
and
its
occupants
and
polly
well
pleased
rushed
on
dilating
on
how
the
bear
looked
and
how
tommy
looked
and
how
the
little
white
chicken
looked
till
in
a
pause
the
crackling
in
the
old
stove
proclaimed
all
things
ready
for
the
baking
of
mamsie
s
birthday
cake
and
she
exclaimed
deary
me
i
must
hurry
oh
well
tommy
saw
the
bear
getting
ready
to
spring
just
like
this
and
he
put
up
his
gun
like
this
and
it
went
bang
bang
and
over
went
bear
quite
quite
like
this
cried
joel
tumbling
off
from
the
to
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
old
floor
just
like
this
polly
sticking
up
his
stubby
black
head
to
look
at
her
no
no
cried
davie
hurrying
to
make
another
heap
of
himself
by
joel
s
side
he
stuck
up
his
legs
didn
t
he
polly
and
out
went
david
s
arms
and
legs
as
stiff
as
sticks
as
he
lay
on
his
back
staring
at
the
ceiling
hoh
hoh
laughed
joel
in
derision
bears

t
tumble
down
that
way
dave
when

re
killed
do
they
polly
yes

contradicted
little
david
not
moving
a
muscle
don
t
they
polly
while
phronsie
tried
to
get
out
of
her
big
chair
to
show
too
how
she
thought
the
bear
would
tumble
over
oh
no
phronsie

cried
polly
in
alarm

both
of
you

his
legs
up
stiff
but
he
was
on
his
back
like

back
cried
joel
whirling
over
while
david
s
stiff
little
wooden
legs
and
arms
fell
down
in
a
twinkling
well
now
you
boys

the
cinnamon
said
polly
with
a
brisk
eye
on
the

the
two

hopping
up
to

off
ii
the
princess
esmeralda
s
ball
it
was
a
most
beautiful
place
cried
polly
oh

she
clasped
her

and
sighed

all
begged
in
one
breath
crowding
around
her
chair
well
i
can
t
till
ben

because
you

he
wanted
to

story
and
polly
flew
out
of
her
rapture
and
picked
up
her
needle
again
dear
me
she
exclaimed
and
a
wave
of
remorse
sent
the
color
flying
over
her
cheek
i
didn
t
mean
to
stop
even
for
a
minute
and
she
glanced
up
at
the
old
clock
ben
never

grumbled
joel
racing
to
the
window
with
davie
at
his
heels
he
s
so
awful
well
it
s
slow
work
said
polly
stitching
away
briskly
to
carry
a
great
heavy
molasses
jug
and
a
bag
of
indian
meal
way
up
here
from
the
store
now
if

boys

joel
kicking
his
toes
against
the
wall
as
he
stared
out
of
the
window
it

dave

turn
now
oh

davie

truly
i
and
we

on
joel
ignoring
david
s
remarks
and
we
had
such
a
lot
to
do
polly
he
added
in
an
injured
tone
you

polly
with
a
fine
scorn
i
said
if

declared
joel
loudly
and
he
kicked
his
toes
triumphantly
phronsie
curled
up
in
a
ball
on
the
floor
at
polly
s
feet
while
she
nursed
seraphina
stared
at
them
gravely
i
ll

she
said
at
last
laying
seraphina
with
a
sigh
on
the
floor
and
getting
up
to
her
feet
oh

said
polly
quickly
you
re
too
little
why

phronsie
and
she
began
to
laugh
but
she
turned
a
cold
shoulder
to
the
boys
i
m
very
big
polly
said
phronsie
gravely
and
standing
up
on
her
tiptoes
see
oh
so
big
and
i
must
go
down
and
help
poor
bensie
let
me
polly
do
and
she
put
up
her
lips
and
the
tears
began
to
come
into
the
brown
eyes
now
you
see
boys
began
polly
casting
aside
her
work
to
take
phronsie
on
her
lap
oh

cried
little
davie
springing
forward
his
face
all
in
a
flame

howled
joel
dashing
away
from
his
window
you

been
ever
so
many
times
dave
i
m
joel
cried
polly
as
he
was
rushing
off
come
here
a
he
came
back
slowly
with
one
eye
on
davie
what
do

polly
he
cried
impatiently
david
to
go
said
polly
slowly
and
looking
steadily
into
his
flushed
face
now
unless
you
really
want
to
go
to
help
bensie
why
you
must
stay
at
i
want
to
go
to
help
bensie
declared
joel
insistently
with
a
very
red
face
o
polly
i
do
let
me
he
was
so
near
to
crying
that
polly
said
hastily
i
know
joey
you
do
want
to
help
bensie
there
there
and
she
gave
him
an
approving
little
pat
i
want
to
help
bensie
cried
joel
his
smiles
all
come
again
to
the
chubby
face
and
off
he
dashed
now
davie
said
polly
in
her
briskest
fashion
and
setting
to
on
the
long
seam
i
think
if
i
were
you
i
d
play
with
phronsie
a
bit
with
a
glance
at
the
disappointed
little
face
come
on
phronsie
said
little
david
gulping
down
his
disappointment
for
now
that
joel
was
fairly
on
the
way
to
meet
ben
nothing
seemed
better
than
to
be
of
the
party
but
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
where
phronsie
immediately
crouched
beside
him
and
in
a
minute
the
only
sound
in
the
old
kitchen
was
the
soft
hum
of
their
voices
and
phronsie
s
delighted
little
gurgle
as
the
play
went
on
i
better
be
going
over
that
story
again
in
my
mind
said
polly
to
herself
i
ve
a
good
chance
now
it
s
so
quiet
and
lovely
and
she
beamed
at
davie
when
he
looked
up
in
a
way
to
make
his
little
heart
glad
and
then
polly
was
lost
in
the
depths
of
her
story
till
the
old
kitchen
and
the
little
brown
house
and
the
children
faded
away
and
she
was
revelling
in
the
glories
of
the
palace
with
retinues
of
courtiers
and
servants
at
her
beck
and
call
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
royalty
around
her
for
was
she
not
the
princess
esmeralda
herself
and
a
smile
played
around
polly
s
lips
as
she
stitched
on
all
unconscious
of
the
task
her
fingers
were
performing
it
was
joel
shouting
close
to
her
chair
and
there
was
ben
coming
in
the
door
with
a
pleased
look
on
his
face
now
for
the
story
screamed
joey
setting
down
the
bag
of
meal
with
a
bang
on
the
table
and
down
tumbled
polly
s
castle
all
around
her
ears
well
i
m
glad
i
ve
got
it
fast
in
my
mind
so
i
can
tell
it
good
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
yes
i
m
ready
and
she
smiled
at
ben
that
s
good
said
ben
heartily
that
you
didn
t
tell
that
story
until
i
got
home

you
suppose
i
would
ben
said
polly
with
an
air
of
reproach
no
i
didn
t
really
said
ben
wiping
his
hot
face
but
it
was
good
of
you
polly
to
wait
for
me
and
it
was
good
of
you
joe
too
to
come
to
meet
me

parson

t

had

this
world

and
she
looked
so
distressed
that
ben
hastened
to
say
most
assuringly
i
know
you
wouldn
t
polly
and
don
t
you
think
henderson
said
it
was
a
most
important
letter
indeed
and
if
henderson

t
had
it
it
would
have
been
very
oh
i

so
glad
he

it
ben
pepper

out
of
her
chair
to
run
and
throw
her
arms
around
him
and
you
were
the
one
to
carry
it
to
illustration
polly
threw
her
arms
around
ben
and
then
when
i
got
to
the
four
corners
went
on
ben
there
was
joel
running
to
meet
me
you
can
t
think
how
good
it
seemed
to
see
him
o
joey

down
to
the
four
corners
cried
polly
turning
to
him
in
a
transport
yes

did
bobbed
joel
glad
to
think
he
had
run
every
step
of
the
way
without
stopping
to
think
and
forgetting
how
his
arms
ached
carrying
the
now
polly

story

so

will
cried
polly
merrily
rushing
back
to
her
chair
and
the
sewing
oh
it
s
so
splendid
that
ben
s
back
we
ve
got
a
whole
hour
now
before
mamsie
s
to
be
home
now
then
as
the
group
huddled
up
around
her
once
upon
a
time
long
years
ago
there
was
one
of
the
richest
kings
and
queens
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
why
they
had
so
much
money
that
nobody
had
ever
counted
it
they
hadn
t
time
you
know
and
it
kept
coming
in
until
the
bags
of
gold
pieces
filled
up
all
one
side
of
the
courtyard
and
they
had
to
build
great
sheds
to
put
the
rest
where
d
it
come
from
broke
in
joel
abruptly
unable
to
keep
still
at
thought
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
oh
the
things
they
sold
in
the
whole
kingdom
were
so
many
said
polly
there
were
millions
no
billions
of
bushels
of
corn
and
wheat
and
rye
and
silks
and
ribbons
and
butter
and
cheese
and
laces
and
artificial
flowers
and
candy
and
oh
my
cried
joel
smacking
his
lips
like
the
pink
sticks
old
beebe
gave
phronsie
the
day
she
hurt
her
toe
queried
david
his
mouth
watering
at
the
remembrance
yes
the
very
same
said
polly
now
you
children
mustn
t
interrupt
every
single
minute
commanded
ben
if
you
do
polly
and
i
will
go
off
into
a
corner
and
she
will
tell
me
the
story
and
phronsie
we
ll
take
her
because
she
hasn
t
said
a
oh

won
t
we
won
t
again

we
dave
cried
joel
with
a
punch
on
that
individual
s
back
no
said
little
david
promptly
please
go
on
you
see
everything
that
anybody
wanted
to
buy
i
mean
the
people
in
other
countries
was
all
for
sale
in
this
kingdom
and
big
ships
went
sailing
off
ever
so
many
times
a
day
with
the
things
piled
in
them
and
when
they
came
back
the
captain
brought
all
the
money
he
got
for
the
things
tied
up
in
big
bags
and
the
ships
kept
coming
back
ever
so
many
a
day
so
that
there
was
no
hope
that
the
gold
pieces
would
ever
be
any
less
and
one
day
the
king
walked
up
and
down
his
palace
hall
wringing
his
hands
oh
i
wish
there
wasn
t
so
much
money
in
the
world
he
cried
for
pretty
soon
i
shall
be
turned
with
all
the
gold
pieces
crowding
me
and
he
looked
so
very
sad
as
his
wife
the
queen
put
her
head
in
the
doorway
that
she
said
my
dear
we
will
have
the
golden
coach
brought
around
to
take
us
out
to
don
t
say
golden
anything
to
me
cried
the
king
in
a
passion
for
he
was
almost
beside
himself
i
m
sick
of
the
sound
of
the
word
my
dear
and
he
beckoned
her
to
him
and
they
went
and
sat
together
on
the
great
throne
at
one
end
of
the
hall
it
shone
with
diamonds
and
rubies
and
emeralds
and
all
manner
of
precious
stones
and
it
had
great
curtains
of
twisted
ropes
of
jewels
looped
up
over
their
heads
and
there
they
sat
and
he
held
her
hand
i
m
really
afraid
and
he
looked
in
her
face
that
something
must
be
done
for
this
is
a
dreadful
state
of
now
if
you
are
going
to
talk
business
said
the
queen
tartly
i
think
it
is
time
to
call
you
see
whenever
there
was
anything
to
decide
in
the
kingdom
the
king
and
queen
never
did
the
leastest
little
bit
of
a
thing
about
it
without
at
first
calling
esmeralda
and
laying
the
case
before
her
so
now
they
rang
five
or
six
golden
bells
in
turn
and
the
king
blew
a
blast
on
a
glass
horn
oh
ever
so
many
feet
long
that
hung
by
his
side
of
the
throne
and
the
queen
whistled
on
a
tremendous
silver
whistle
that
hung
by
her
side
of
the
throne
and
pretty
soon
esmeralda
came
running
in
all
out
of
breath
she
was
dressed
in
satin
over
a
white
lace
petticoat
pinned
up
with
diamonds
and
she
had
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
hand
that
were
sweet
with
the
morning
dew
she
had
long
floating
yellow
hair
just
like
phronsie
s
and
polly
paused
long
enough
to
glance
lovingly
at
the
small
head
snuggled
up
against
her
knee
illustration
in
came
the
princess
father
and
mother
said
the
princess
esmeralda
kneeling
before
her
parents
sitting
on
the
throne
and
she
laid
the
flowers
with
the
morning
dew
on
them
in
their
hands
we
have
summoned
you
esmeralda
said
the
king
in
a
troubled
way
because
we
are
in
dire
extremity
and
must
have
your
esmeralda
wrinkled
her
pretty
brow
and
looked
very
wise
but
her
heart
beat
dreadfully
against
her
bodice
and
what
s
a
bod
began
joel
ugh
cried
ben
with
a
warning
finger
held
up
as
joel
ducked
instantly
it
s
a
waist
that
princesses
always
wear
said
polly
and
esmeralda
s
was
all
spangled
with
gold
and
silver
it
shone
so
that
no
one
could
look
at
it
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
well
so
she
said
yes
father
and
yes
we
have
too
much
gold
said
the
king
smiting
his
hands
together
esmeralda
i
tell
you
truly
if
it
keeps
coming
in
we
shall
all
have
to
move
out
from
this
palace
and
find
another
home
what
shall
we
do
my
child
esmeralda
jumped
up
from
her
knees
and
ran
to
the
casement
and
climbed
up
the
golden
seat
beneath
it
and
peered
out
there
were
the
ships
below
her
in
the
harbor
with
the
men
taking
out
the
bags
and
bags
and
bags
of
gold
and
as
far
as
her
eye
could
reach
there
were
more
ships
and
more
ships
and
more
ships
all
coming
in
filled
with
bags
to
the
very
brim
she
got
down
and
ran
back
it
is
certainly
very
dreadful
father
and
mother
she
said
clasping
her
hands
indeed
it
is
declared
the
king
and
he
began
to
tear
his
hair
husband
don
t
feel
so
badly
implored
the
poor
queen
at
that
sight
throwing
her
arms
around
him
esmeralda
you
must
think
quickly
because
you
see
we
are
both
going
quite
so
esmeralda
said
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
you
might
tell
the
men
to
untie
the
bags
and
pour
the
gold
pieces
into
the
sea
at
the
mouth
of
the
the
very
thing
exclaimed
the
king
in
delight
and
his
face
was
covered
with
smiles
oh
what
it
is
to
have
a
clever
child
and
the
queen
fell
upon
esmeralda
s
neck
and
kissed
and
kissed
her
so
then
the
king
rang
all
his
bells
and
blew
his
long
glass
horn
and
then
he
struck
a
big
silver
gong
that
was
always
the
signal
for
the
lord
high
chamberlain
to
appear
and
when
he
popped
in
with
his
robes
of
office
all
caught
up
in
his
hands
to
let
him
run
to
obey
the
king
s
call
and
his
high
peaked
hat
awry
for
the
same
reason
the
king
gave
him
the
order
just
as
esmeralda
said
and
then
the
lord
high
chamberlain
plunged
out
after
bowing
himself
before
the
throne
five
and
twenty
times
to
the
marble
floor
and
the
king
said
to
the
queen
in
the
greatest
satisfaction
my
dear
we
must
give
esmeralda
a
ball
for
being
so
and
the
queen
said
yes
a
ball
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
esmeralda
hopped
up
and
down
in
glee
she
was
so
happy
and
she
danced
and
danced
until
off
flew
of
the
diamonds
from
her
lace
petticoat
and
rolled
away
into
as
many
cracks
and
crevices
in
the
corners
of
the
marble
hall
but
she
didn
t
care
for
there
were
bushels
in
her
room
and
a
dozen
or
two
women
always
sitting
on
their
crickets
with
their
needles
threaded
with
silver
thread
ready
to
sew
on
more
so
then
the
word
went
out
from
the
palace
all
over
the
kingdom
that
there
was
to
be
a
ball
for
the
princess
esmeralda
and
all
the
while
the
golden
stream
was
pouring
out
every
minute
from
the
big
bags
into
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
esmeralda
fell
asleep
every
night
to
dream
of
the
beautiful
music
and
flowers
and
lights
and
the
gay
young
princes
to
be
sent
for
as
company
from
every
other
kingdom
for
you
must
know
that
never
had
there
been
such
a
ball
in
all
this
world
before
as
this
one
was
to
be
and
every
morning
esmeralda
waked
up
quite
quite
happy
because
the
ball
night
was
just
so
much
nearer
and
at
last
her
dress
was
all
ready
and
laid
out
upon
her
little
white
bed
it
was
polly
paused
most
impressively
to
allow
her
hearers
to
take
it
all
in
properly
it
was
made
out
of
the
very
finest
cobwebs
that
had
all
been
spun
in
the
sunshine
of
the
palace
for
this
millions
of
spiders
had
been
caught
by
the
command
of
the
king
who
had
sent
out
an
edict
for
that
purpose
and
they
had
been
set
spinning
until
they
had
made
this
beautiful
dress
of
the
princess
and
it
was
trimmed
around
the
bottom
and
the
neck
by
a
rainbow
and
o
polly
exclaimed
ben
there
ben
s
talking
broke
in
joel
in
huge
delight
hoh
hoh
yes
a
rainbow
repeated
polly
stoutly
a
beautiful
red
and
green
and
blue
and
yellow
rainbow
oh
you
can
t
begin
to
think
children
how
perfectly
lovely
esmeralda
did
look
when
she
was
all
dressed
ready
for
the
ball
well
and
then
the
princes
began
to
arrive
there
were
two
hundred
of
them
and
each
one
brought
the
princess
a
present
but
the
king
had
said
that
she
should
not
accept
anything
of
gold
so
it
had
been
some
little
trouble
for
them
to
get
anything
that
was
nice
enough
without
having
it
golden
but
they
did
and
there
were
two
hundred
presents
set
out
in
the
palace
hall
and
esmeralda
was
to
walk
up
and
down
the
whole
length
and
choose
the
present
she
liked
the
best
out
of
the
whole
collection
and
then
she
was
to
dance
with
the
prince
who
had
given
her
this
present
oh
dear
me
she
thought
she
would
cry
her
eyes
out
when
the
king
decided
this
must
be
done
for
how
was
she
to
choose
between
so
many
perfectly
beautiful
things
and
there
would
be
one
hundred
and
princes
feeling
very
unhappy
indeed
she
was
just
going
to
say
oh
my
father
i
can
not
do
it
and
then
she
knew
the
king
would
ring
and
strike
his
big
silver
gong
and
blow
for
the
lord
high
chamberlain
to
take
him
off
from
the
throne
and
put
him
to
bed
and
then
the
lights
would
be
turned
out
and
everybody
would
go
home
and
there
would
be
no
ball
at
all
she
couldn
t
do
that
of
course
as
you
see
so
she
stopped
a
minute
to
think
as
she
always
did
when
she
had
hard
questions
to
decide
until
the
king
roared
at
her
do
as
i
say
daughter
or
out
go
the
lights
and
then
she
said
the
first
thing
that
came
in
her
head
i
like
all
the
presents
best
and
we
ll
all
dance
together
at
dear
me
exclaimed
the
king
how
clever
and
he
screamed
joyfully
to
the
musicians
to
begin
and
the
princess
and
the
two
hundred
princes
all
began
hopping
and
jumping
about
the
hall
and
presently
it
looked
so
nice
the
king
gave
his
hand
to
the
queen
and
she
slid
down
from
the
throne
and
began
to
hop
about
too
and
the
lord
high
chancellor
picked
up
his
flowing
robes
and
danced
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
and
the
court
ladies
skipped
back
and
forth
and
the
servants
came
to
look
in
the
doorways
and
so
did
the
retinues
of
soldiers
and
they
couldn
t
help
it
the
music
was
so
fine
and
oh
dear
me
it
went
just
like
this
and
polly
broke
off
into
a
merry
little
tune
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
held
out
her
hands
come
on
let
us
all
dance
and
she
seized
ben
s
arms
and
danced
him
half
across
the
old
kitchen
floor
take
me
polly
begged
joel
who
had
tumbled
over
himself
in
surprise
and
now
got
to
his
feet
to
run
after
the
two
spinning
off
so
finely
can
t
said
polly
over
her
shoulder

phronsie
and
then
she
began
again
on
the
gay
tune
ben
whistling
away
for
dear
life
as
an
accompaniment
dave
s
got
her
said
joel
in
great
discomfiture
turning
around
to
see
little
davie
and
phronsie

pink
calico
gown
flying
along
at
a
merry
rate
i
haven
t

stopped
short
come
with
us
and
she
held
out
her
hand
and
ben
grasped
joel
s
arm
and
away
they
went
till
the
old
kitchen
rang
with
the
fun
iii

the
babel
of
rejoicing

have
it
bensie
she
whispered
you

they

it

rained
for
three
days

and
you

there

t
dare
let
her
have
any
more
to

until
he
d
sold
what
he
had
and
trade
s
so
and
polly
sighed
and
wiped
away
two
tears
ben
turned
away
a
moment
and
swallowed
something
hard
that
was
in
his
throat
polly
at
sight
of
this
began
to
laugh
and
she
said
gayly
yes

the
circus
story
now
get
your
chairs
and
let
s
sit
round
in
a
ring
with
that
the
babel
of
rejoicing
changed
into
a
scuffle
for
chairs
and
crickets
joel
protesting
that
he
should
sit
next
to
polly
and
phronsie
scuttling
along
to
crowd
into
polly
s
lap
till
the
little
old
kitchen
fairly
rang
with
the
noise
let
s
sit
in
a
ring
on
the
floor
polly
that
s
best
begged
little
david
so
they
all
got
down
and
polly
had
joel
on
one
side
and
phronsie
on
the
other
though
to
be
sure
everybody
was
next
to
everybody
else
as
the
ring
was
constantly
moving
up
closer
till
it
was
a
bunch
of
five
little
peppers
and
everybody
looked
as
if
there
had
been
plenty
of
breakfast
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
in
the
little
brown
house
enough
for
all
time
to
come
now
you
know
children
said
polly
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
feeling
quite
elegant
to
be
sitting
down
in
the
morning
telling
stories
and
she
looked
at
them
impressively
i
ve
promised
you
the
circus
story
for
a
yes
we
know
said
joel
hitching
impatiently
don
t
talk
but
polly
shot
him
a
reproving
glance
that
made
him
duck
behind
davie
who
sat
next
as
she
went
on
and
now
i
m
going
to
give
it
to
you
i
know
mamsie
d
say
twas
best
everything
s
all
clean
spick
span
and
she
glanced
with
pride
around
the
little
old
kitchen
that
shone
from
top
to
toe
mamsie
d
like
it
cooed
phronsie
and
she
patted
her
pink
apron
down
and
looked
at
polly
to
begin
the
circus
story
said
polly
beginning
with
a
great
flourish
is
about
so
many
best
and
splendid
things
that
you
must
keep
quite
still
and
not
interrupt
me
a
single
teenty
wee
illustration
the
circus
story
said
polly
is
about
so
many
best
and
splendid
things
that
you
must
keep
quite
they
one
and
all
protested
that
they
wouldn
t
say
a
word
so
she
began
while
each
one
sat
as
still
as
a
mouse
way
far
over
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
said
polly
so
far
that
no
one
had
ever
been
entirely
over
it
at
least
to
come
back
lived
a
big
man
he
was
so
large
that
he
couldn
t
have
found
any
house
in
all
badgertown
big
enough
to
get
into
if
he
had
tried
ever
and
ever
so
much
he
had
arms
and
legs
and
eyes
to
match
you
know
and
feet
and
ears
so
he
could
take
perfectly
dreadfully
large
steps
and
he
could
lift
as
big
rocks
in
his
hands
as
the
one
hanging
over
cherry
brook
oh
and
he
could
see
with
his
big
eyes
that
stood
right
out
of
his
face
just
like
cannon
balls
so
that
nothing
could
hide
from
him
even
if
it
tried
ever
so
joel
twisted
uneasily
and
wriggled
up
nearer
to
polly
s
side
and
one
day
the
big
man
sat
down
on
a
spur
of
the
mountain
and
dangled
his
feet
down
the
side
this
was
his
swing
you
know
and
he
always
sat
there
when
he
was
thinking
hard
over
anything
or
making
plans
well
there
he
sat
thinking
thinking
away
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
and
pretty
soon
he
got
up
and
slapped
his
knee
just
as
tisbett
does
you
know
and
he
roared
out
the
very
thing
the
thing
and
folks
down
in
the
valley
all
ran
to
their
windows
and
said
it
thundered
and
they
drove
into
the
barns
and
sheds
and
got
ready
for
the
storm
well
after
the
big
man
stopped
roaring
the
very
thing
and
slapping
his
knee
he
looked
down
the
mountain
the
side
he
lived
on
you
know
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
hippo
hippo
moppi
here
polly
paused
to
take
breath
she
was
very
fond
of
long
words
and
it
was
her
great
delight
to
wrestle
with
them
so
now
she
thought
she
had
done
very
well
indeed
and
she
ran
on
in
the
best
of
spirits
oh
he
was
so
big
there
isn
t
anything
children
that
can
tell
you
how
big
he
was
well
the
big
man
no
sooner
saw
him
than
he
ran
like
lightning
on
his
perfectly
dreadfully
large
feet
down
his
side
of
the
mountain
and
he
said
to
the
hippo
pippo
poppi
moppicus
here
you
sir
put
your
head
in
this
and
he
twitched
out
of
one
of
his
side
pockets
a
string
it
was
made
of
leather
and
was
just
as
strong
oh
you
can
t
think
well
the
hippo
i
m
going
to
call
him
that
for
short
said
polly
suddenly
quite
tired
out
took
a
good
look
all
around
but
he
saw
no
way
of
escape
and
the
big
man
kept
growing
more
dreadfully
cross
every
minute
he
waited
so
the
poor
hippo
at
last
said
as
you
please
sir
and
he
put
his
head
into
the
string
and
was
tied
fast
to
a
big
tree
that
was
one
hundred
and
feet
round
then
the
big
man
laughed
a
perfectly
dreadful
laugh
and
he
said
when
he
had
finished
now
you
are
going
to
the
circus
sir
and
see
the
pennies
taken
in
at
the
then
he
went
off
up
to
his
again
and
presently
he
looked
down
his
side
of
the
mountain
again
and
he
spied
a
big
snake
oh
a
beautiful
one
all
green
and
gold
stripes
and
great
flashing
green
eyes
to
match
for
the
big
man
watched
snake
raise
his
head
as
he
wriggled
along
and
he
ran
down
his
side
of
the
mountain
on
his
dreadfully
large
feet
as
quick
as
a
flash
and
stood
in
front
of
snake
who
looked
this
way
and
that
for
a
chance
to
escape
but
there
was
none
you
see
for
the
dreadfully
large
feet
of
the
big
man
took
up
all
the
room
so
at
last
snake
said
in
a
voice
just
like
this
if
you
please
sir
would
you
move
just
a
little
put
your
head
in
here
sir
roared
the
big
man
at
him
so
that
the
snake
shook
and
shook
just
like
a
leaf
on
one
of
our
in
a
storm
well
and
at
last
he
had
his
head
with
the
flashing
green
eyes
fast
in
a
big
bag
which
you
must
know
in
a
twinkling
the
big
man
had
pulled
out
of
his
other
side
pocket
and
then
he
was
left
to
go
flopping
and
flopping
around
on
the
ground
most
dismally
and
then
the
big
man
scrambled
up
to
his
again
well
said
polly
with
a
long
breath
the
next
thing
he
saw
was
a
as
much
bigger
than
the
others
as
you
can
imagine
and
he
got
him
fast
too
so
he
couldn
t
get
away
and
then
he
went
up
to
spy
out
more
animals
and
by
the
time
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
mountain
and
he
couldn
t
catch
any
more
he
had
two
hundred
creatures
all
tied
fast
to
trees
or
with
their
heads
in
bags
and
then
he
sat
down
on
a
big
stone
to
i
should
think
he
d
have
to
said
ben
under
his
breath
polly
shot
him
a
reproving
glance
and
hurried
on
well
after
he
was
all
rested
nicely
again
he
jumped
up
from
his
stone
and
looked
them
all
in
the
face
that
is
he
looked
those
who
were
tied
to
trees
in
the
face
but
those
with
their
heads
in
bags
of
course
he
couldn
t
and
he
said
my
friends
for
he
thought
he
ought
to
treat
them
kindly
they
d
been
so
good
to
him
i
m
going
to
take
you
to
see
the
world
a
then
he
untied
those
who
were
tied
to
the
trees
and
set
them
in
a
line
the
hippo
in
front
because
he
had
him
the
longest
so
it
was
right
to
give
him
the
first
place
and
the
creatures
with
their
heads
in
the
bags
he
set
in
the
middle
because
they
didn
t
need
to
see
but
could
just
follow
the
noise
of
the
animals
stepping
in
front
of
them
and
then
a
long
line
of
more
animals
then
the
big
man
cut
down
one
of
the
large
trees
and
switched
it
at
the
heels
of
the
last
animal
which
was
a
o
polly
gasped
ben
yes
twas
she
declared
positively
with
red
cheeks
i
m
quite
sure
of
that
word
for
i
saw
it
in
the
book
parson
higginson
lent
us
so
there
ben
well
never
mind
said
ben
faintly
go
on
with
the
story
so
polly
made
her
rhododendron
move
as
swiftly
as
all
the
others
in
the
line
and
presently
the
whole
procession
with
the
big
man
at
its
rear
switching
the
heels
of
the
last
animal
was
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
then
he
called
in
a
loud
voice
come
and
get
your
polly
got
over
this
very
well
and
hurried
on
glibly
and
all
the
people
who
had
opened
their
and
houses
thinking
there
was
to
be
no
storm
clapped
them
to
again
in
a
fright
all
except
one
man
and
they
screamed
to
him
that
he
was
risking
his
life
but
he
didn
t
care
and
he
wouldn
t
pay
any
attention
to
them
so
he
poked
his
head
out
of
his
doorway
and
he
screamed
i
m
going
up
the
mountain
to
see
for
myself
if
there
s
going
to
be
a
and
they
all
bade
him
and
said
they
were
sure
they
should
never
see
him
again
and
then
they
locked
their
doors
and
padlocked
them
and
away
he
ran
up
the
mountain
the
big
man
was
waiting
for
him
and
he
said
to
his
animals
now
my
friends
when
that
man
s
head
begins
to
show
over
that
there
pointing
to
the
tree
do
you
all
say
how
do
you
do
and
do
you
do
and
how
do
you
do
so
the
animals
said
they
would
and
as
soon
as
the
man
s
head
was
to
be
seen
peeping
over
the
as
he
ran
pretty
fast
they
all
said
it
the
hippo
roared
it
and
snake
grumbled
it
clear
down
half
his
length
and
the
squealed
it
and
the
elephant
howled
it
and
the
what
did
the
rhododendron
do
asked
ben
and
the
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
there
was
a
perfectly
splendid
in
the
collection
said
polly
not
taking
any
notice
of
ben
and
he
said
it
big
and
loud
in
his
natural
voice
and
the
monkey
shrieked
it
and
oh
is
there
a
dear
sweet
little
monkey
cried
phronsie
in
a
transport
o
polly
i
want
him
to
play
with
i
oh
no
phronsie
you
can
t
said
polly
hurrying
on
the
has
to
have
him
you
know
well
and
oh
dear
me
every
single
one
of
those
animals
said
how
do
you
do
and
do
you
do
and
how
do
you
do
and
the
man
took
one
look
at
them
and
he
said
pretty
well
i
thank
and
the
big
man
said
you
re
the
man
for
me
and
i
give
all
these
animals
to
you
for
you
are
the
only
one
who
isn
t
afraid
now
march
and
and
the
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
and
there
wasn
t
any
big
man
all
that
was
left
was
the
long
line
of
animals
and
crawling
things
so
down
the
the
procession
went
and
at
the
foot
there
were
sixteen
red
carts
with
yellow
borders
and
a
cunning
little
carriage
drawn
by
ever
and
ever
so
many
dear
sweet
ponies
no
bigger
than
dogs
and
then
in
a
minute
out
from
behind
the
trees
came
rushing
as
many
as
a
dozen
no
two
dozen
big
horses
with
long
tails
and
they
swept
up
to
the
to
have
him
scratch
their
the
five
little
peppers
now
became
dreadfully
excited
and
joel
jumped
up
he
screamed
as
he
pranced
around
and
around
the
group
on
the
floor
stepping
high
and
slapping
himself
as
he
raced
along
come
on
dave
this
is
the
way
i
d
make
em
go
all
those
polly
do
you
suppose
we
ll
ever
see
a
circus
cried
little
davie
with
shining
eyes
ever
in
all
this
world
ever
in
all
this
world
hummed
phronsie
while
ben
set
his
teeth
tight
together
and
looked
at
her
yes
indeed
declared
polly
confidently
with
eyes
only
for
ben
don
t
look
so
ben
she
cried
we
ll
see
one
polly
always
gets
her
flowers
said
little
davie
in
a
moment
in
a
reflective
way
and
if
we
don
t
ever
get
to
see
a
really
truly
circus
cried
polly
impulsively
we
can
hear
all
about
it
same
s
we
have
already
from
and
beebe
so
just
think
what
those
children
must
have
to
do
who
don
t
ever
have
anybody
to
tell
them
about
it
as
we
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
was
lost
in
thought
g
lang
cried
joel
with
an
awful
noise
making
his
steeds
put
forth
all
their
best
paces
around
the
little
old
kitchen
and
i
m
so
glad
polly
was
saying
that
and
beebe
did
see
a
circus
when
they
went
down
to
rockport
it
s
the
greatest
comfort
now
if
you
don
t
stop
joel
i
can
t
tell
the
rest
of
the
story
and
you
make
so
much
noise
we
can
t
hear
anything
said
ben
so
joel
gave
up
slapping
his
imaginary
beasts
and
bounded
into
the
middle
of
the
group
again
and
the
little
old
kitchen
quieting
down
polly
took
up
the
story
once
more
well
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
big
white
tent
that
was
really
the
home
of
all
the
animals
and
crawling
things
when
they
actually
got
home
and
staid
still
exclaimed
polly
starting
off
oh
it
was
quite
magnificent
i
can
tell
you
it
was
as
big
as
the
and
it
had
a
great
flag
on
top
that
swung
out
in
the
breeze
at
every
bit
of
wind
and
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
seats
all
around
it
in
a
ring
and
down
in
the
middle
was
the
place
where
the
horses
danced
and
like
this
whooped
joel
breaking
away
again
from
the
bunch
of
five
little
peppers
on
the
floor
but
ben
picked
him
by
the
jacket
sleeve
and
made
him
sit
down
suddenly
hold
on
there
he
said
you
keep
still
joe
you
re
worse
than
a
tornado
go
on
polly
i
ll
hold
him
as
polly
laughed
and
hurried
on
one
day
they
were
having
a
beautiful
time
the
band
that
always
rode
in
the
red
wagon
with
the
yellow
wheels
was
playing
away
oh
such
lovely
music
sighed
polly
and
the
big
tent
was
just
crammed
full
of
people
and
the
horses
were
dancing
and
everybody
was
just
as
happy
as
could
be
when
a
great
big
man
oh
his
head
was
almost
up
to
the
top
of
the
tent
when
he
stood
up
straight
came
up
to
the
door
and
stooped
down
and
peeked
in
go
right
away
screamed
the
at
him
as
cross
as
he
could
be
where
s
the
asked
the
great
big
man
and
he
kept
peeking
in
i
sha
n
t
go
till
i
ve
seen
the
illustration
where
s
the
asked
the
great
big
man
so
somebody
had
to
run
and
get
the
and
they
made
him
stop
although
he
was
just
in
the
midst
of
showing
off
the
monkey
who
was
having
a
waltz
on
the
back
of
the
biggest
elephant
and
he
was
pretty
cross
and
he
marched
up
to
the
great
big
man
and
he
pretended
not
to
know
him
and
he
said
very
sharply
go
right
off
you
re
making
a
perfectly
dreadful
noise
and
you
haven
t
paid
and
you
can
t
go
don
t
you
know
me
cried
the
great
big
man
and
he
stood
up
quite
straight
and
his
eyes
that
stuck
out
like
two
cannon
balls
stared
at
him
go
right
away
said
the
angrily
i
never
saw
you
before
in
all
my
life
or
i
ll
set
the
dogs
on
you
and
he
snapped
his
whip
oh

said
the
great
big
man
the
next
time
you
come
up
to
my
mountain
you
needn
t
stop
to
see
me
come
every
single
one
of
you
beasts
and
beastesses
and
reptiles
and
reptilesses
and
animals
it
s
time
to
go
home
he
roared
and
everybody
inside
the
big
tent
screamed
that
it
thundered
and
that
they
d
all
be
killed
and
the
elephant
knocked
the
monkey
off
from
his
back
and
the
big
snake
slipped
out
and
the
rhinoceros
jumped
over
the
heads
of
the
children
who
were
giving
him
peanuts
and
the
hippo
ran
and
and
the
rhododendron
said
ben
what
did
he
do
don
t
forget
him
and
the
said
polly
with
a
cold
shoulder
for
ben
and
all
of
them
they
just
ran
and
jumped
and
skipped
and
hopped
and
wriggled
out
of
that
tent
and
the
great
big
man
was
going
off
on
his
perfectly
dreadfully
large
feet
till
he
was
miles
away
in
a
few
minutes
and
off
they
all
hurried
every
single
one
of
them
after
him
and
although
the
chased
and
chased
and
after
them
he
never
could
catch
them
and
that
s
all
said
polly
leaning
back
quite
exhausted
well
well
exclaimed
mother
pepper
coming
in
suddenly
upon
the
absorbed
little
group
now
that
looks
comfortable
and
her
face
lighted
up
and
she
beamed
at
polly
o

every
one
of

bunch
as

sprang
to
their

mamsie
brightly
but
nobody

ask
her
if

sacks

a
long
sigh
phronsie

took
her

old
clock

polly
i

just

to
when
you
stopped
me
about
the
that
s
just
it
said
ben
over
his
shoulder
i
wouldn
t
tell
him
a
single
thing
if
he
goes
on
like
that
take
my
advice
polly
and
don
t
promise
him
another
but
polly
was
already
launched
into
her
gayest
and
best
narration
and
joel
slipped
off
from
his
to
the
floor
where
he
snuggled
up
against
her
feet
his
head
on
her
knees
phronsie
longing
to
do
the
same
thing
but
remembering
what
polly
had
said
about
sewing
mamsie
s
seams
she
sat
up
very
straight
in
her
chair
and
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
did
johnny
have
tin
soldiers
too
asked
david
in
an
tone
of
course
child
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
why
he
had
a
big
house
full
of
just
make
dave
stop
talking
said
joel
irritably
we
can
t
hear
anything
do
go
on
about
the
soldiers
polly
you
said
you
now
the
first
one
of
you
children
that
says
a
word
said
polly
merrily
will
have
to
go
out
into
the
provision
room
and
stay
till
i
finish
this
story
i
never
shall
get
through
at
this
rate
now
good
for
you
ben
bobbed
his
approval
and
set
in
two
or
three
nails
with
smart
little
taps
of
his
hammer
well
johnny
made
up
his
mind
that
his
tin
soldiers
had
too
easy
a
time
because
there
hadn
t
been
anybody
to
fight
you
know
for
one
thing
johnny
being
off
for
three
days
fishing
with
the
mullen
boy
who
lived
next
door
and
too
busy
to
get
up
a
battle
with
any
one
and
so
things
had
got
to
be
pretty
easy
and
the
tin
soldiers
were
just
as
lazy
as
could
be
and
some
of
them
don
t
you
think
were
lying
on
their
backs
on
the
closet
shelf
and
one
had
even
rolled
off
and
was
having
a
nap
down
in
the
corner
where
he
thought
nobody
could
see
wake
up
there
hallooed
johnny
flinging
wide
the
closet
door
very
suddenly
there
s
going
to
be
a
big
battle
attention
get
ready
form
ugh
ugh
grunted
joel
starting
up
then
he
clapped
his
two
brown
hands
over
his
mouth
and
sat
down
again
polly
ran
on
with
an
approving
smile
at
him
and
then
johnny
saw
the
poor
little
fellow
fast
asleep
in
the
here
she
caught
sight
of
phronsie
opening
her
mouth
and
she
hastened
to
add
and
he
picked
him
up
and
set
him
straight
now
fall
into
line
my
men
he
shouted
at
them
and
before
anybody
knew
just
how
there
they
were
every
single
little
tin
soldier
out
in
the
garden
under
the
arbor
and
illustration
ugh
ugh
cried
joel
explosively
then
he
ducked
and
came
up
red
and
shining
his
lips
tightly
pressed
together
you
re
such
a
good
boy
josey
exclaimed
polly
now
you
see
how
perfectly
elegant
it
is
to
tell
stories
without
having
to
stop
every
minute
to
explain
things
well
and
there
were
jack
mullen
s
wooden
soldiers
all
standing
up
to
fight
with
jack
as
proud
and
stiff
as
he
could
be
back
of
them
they
weren
t
as
nice
as
johnny
s
because
you
see
jack
had
left
his
out
in
the
rain
the
night
his
mother
gave
a
party
he
forgot
to
take
em
in
and
the
paint
was
all
washed
off
and
one
soldier
had
his
legs
chipped
off
a
bit
where
jack
s
little
cousin
had
tried
his
new
knife
on
it
so
he
went
lame
and
another
one
had
his
gun
smashed
where
it
got
stepped
on
by
the
hired
man
when
jack
dropped
it
in
the
barn
one
day
but
they
were
brave
as
they
could
be
and
there
they
were
all
ranged
up
in
when
johnny
brought
out
his
soldiers
cried
johnny
prancing
along
driving
his
soldiers
down
the
path
their
swords
and
guns
were
clanking
and
they
looked
so
smart
in
their
scarlet
coats
and
caps
with
the
nodding
plumes
my
men
can
beat
yours
any
day
jack
mullen
you
ll
see
cried
jack
firing
up
let
s
get
em
to
work
that
s
all
i
say
and
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
laughed
long
and
loud
johnny
went
around
among
his
men
and
whispered
something
in
each
ear
it
sounded
like
cakes
and
then
every
soldier
nodded
real
pleased
and
smacked
his
lips
and
here
there
was
tremendous
excitement
among
the
children
but
polly
pretended
not
to
see
it
and
only
stopping
to
bite
off
her
thread
she
hurried
on
and
suddenly
johnny
screamed
wait
a
minute
and
off
he
dashed
and
ran
into
the
kitchen
jane
jane
i
must
have
sixteen
no
seventeen
cakes
make
em
big
jane
and
put
pink
on
top
same
as
my
sunday
screamed
joel
but
davie
in
alarm
lest
joe
should
be
sent
off
to
the
provision
room
and
just
in
the
most
splendid
part
of
the
story
jumped
off
from
his
chair
and
flung
his
arms
around
him
in
distress
hurry
up
roared
jack
after
him
else
i
ll
begin
the
battle
and
shoot
every
one
of
your
men
s
heads
off
bang
bang
here
polly
put
down
the
big
sack
a
minute
and
thrust
up
an
imaginary
gun
to
her
shoulder
to
show
exactly
how
jack
mullen
looked
ben
dropped
the
washboard
and
came
out
of
his
corner
to
look
at
her
and
sure
enough
said
polly
with
kindling
eyes
he
was
at
it
when
johnny
got
back
red
and
breathless
from
his
run
from
the
kitchen
so
of
course
his
tin
soldiers
had
a
perfectly
awful
time
from
the
very
beginning
oh
you
can
t
think
children
how
they
did
have
to
fight
and
don
t
you
believe
they
were
crowded
off
inch
by
inch
down
that
perfectly
beautiful
under
the
arbor
until
there
was
only
one
little
corner
to
stand
on
for
a
place
of
defence
and
the
guns
banged
and
the
cannon
roared
and
the
smoke
was
so
thick
you
could
cut
it
with
a
knife
and
in
and
through
it
all
were
the
scarlet
coats
and
caps
with
the
nodding
plumes
of
the
little
tin
soldiers
and
every
one
of
em
was
as
brave
as
could
be
and
saying
cakes
to
himself
but
there
must
come
an
end
and
joel
was
just
going
to
scream
no
no
don
t
let
it
come
to
an
end
polly
when
he
remembered
in
time
and
she
ran
on
gayly
and
johnny
was
hopping
up
and
down
feeling
dreadfully
but
trying
to
get
up
a
last
charge
and
jack
was
screaming
we
ve
beaten
you
hurrah
for
my
men
when
a
dozen
boys
jumped
over
the
fence
and
dashed
right
into
the
the
are
coming
down
this
street
screamed
every
single
one
of
em
come
on
the
tin
soldiers
of
course
supposed
in
the
din
of
battle
and
all
that
dreadful
smoke
that
a
terrible
charge
from
the
wooden
soldiers
had
come
set
on
by
those
perfectly
dreadful
boys
and
the
wooden
soldiers
thought
that
the
boys
were
helping
the
tin
soldiers
so
each
side
started
to
run
away
from
the
other
and
the
tin
soldiers
ran
the
fastest
because
they
were
thinner
and
lighter
so
they
didn
t
find
out
their
mistake
until
too
late
and
they
all
fell
into
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
meanwhile
after
johnny
and
jack
had
climbed
the
fence
and
were
off
at
the
corner
of
the
street
with
the
twelve
boys
jane
came
out
with
seventeen
little
cakes
with
pink
on
top
and
not
finding
any
one
she
placed
the
tray
on
the
seat
under
the
and
the
black
cat
the
largest
one
at
johnny
s
house
you
know
the
one
with
the
green
eyes
came
stepping
softly
up
and
smelt
them
all
over
then
she
yowed
for
the
neighbor
s
gray
cat
with
whom
she
was
quite
sociable
and
they
ate
them
all
up
every
christmas
at
the
big
house
you
must
know
children
said
polly
most
impressively
that
there
was
to
be
a
christmas
at
the
big
christmas
each
of
the
three
younger
peppers
the
children
as
polly
and
ben
called
them
set
up
a
shout
at
the
magic
word
ben
set
his
teeth
together
hard
and
listened
no
one
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
christmas
or
knew
in
the
least
what
it
was
like
only
from
what
jasper
had
told
them
and
now
polly
was
to
draw
from
her
imagination
and
give
them
a
no
wonder
at
the
babel
that
ensued
the
big
house
began
polly
had
ever
and
ever
so
many
windows
and
doors
to
it
and
it
set
back
from
the
street
and
there
was
a
road
up
for
the
carriages
and
another
for
folks
to
walk
up
oh
and
there
were
lots
of
children
that
belonged
to
the
house
as
many
as
we
are
and
polly
glanced
around
on
the
bunch
of
little
peppers
well
you
know
the
big
house
had
always
had
a
christmas
every
year
whenever
it
came
around
they
had
hung
up
their
stockings
and
had
trees
just
like
what
jasper
told
us
of
and
all
sorts
of
nice
things
they
d
tried
time
and
again
so
what
to
do
this
christmas
why
none
of
them
could
think
at
last
jenny
she
was
the
biggest
girl
proposed
that
each
child
should
write
out
what
he
or
she
wanted
to
do
most
of
all
and
not
let
any
one
else
see
what
was
written
but
fold
the
paper
and
tuck
it
into
grandpapa
s
white
hat
in
the
hall
grandpapa
always
wore
a
tall
white
hat
whenever
he
went
out
and
when
he
was
at
home
the
hat
stood
on
its
head
on
the
and
no
one
was
ever
allowed
to
touch
that
hat
so
the
children
knew
it
would
be
a
perfectly
safe
place
to
drop
the
papers
in
and
then
when
all
were
in
even
the
baby
s
because
jenny
would
write
hers
for
mehitable
that
was
the
baby
s
name
why
grandpapa
would
take
the
hat
and
turn
out
all
the
papers
and
read
them
and
decide
what
they
better
do
in
order
to
keep
christmas
well
every
single
child
in
the
big
house
had
written
on
his
paper
and
put
it
carefully
into
grandpapa
s
big
white
hat
and
grandpapa
had
taken
out
all
the
papers
the
children
had
seen
him
as
they
peeked
out
of
the
door
into
the
hall
and
then
he
went
away
into
another
room
and
shut
himself
in
illustration
grandpapa
had
taken
out
all
the
papers
children
he
said
as
at
last
after
what
seemed
to
them
a
perfect
age
he
opened
his
door
and
came
out
we
will
have
a
tree
this
christmas
then
he
laughed
and
held
up
seven
papers
for
you
must
know
that
besides
the
five
children
who
always
and
every
day
lived
at
the
big
house
there
were
two
cousins
a
girl
and
a
boy
who
were
visiting
there
every
single
paper
declared
grandpapa
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
had
tree
written
across
well
you
see
by
that
the
children
were
not
tired
of
christmas
trees
and
as
soon
as
grandpapa
told
them
that
they
were
to
have
one
they
were
quite
satisfied
although
jenny
did
say
that
if
she
had
known
every
one
else
had
chosen
it
she
would
have
written
some
other
thing
on
her
paper
but
that
didn
t
make
any
difference
now
and
what
they
all
had
to
do
was
to
get
ready
and
the
next
day
found
the
whole
big
house
in
oh
such
a
bustle
you
would
think
they
never
had
gotten
a
tree
ready
for
christmas
in
all
their
lives
there
was
such
a
fuss
made
in
the
first
place
grandpapa
had
to
go
out
and
speak
to
a
man
to
send
up
into
the
country
and
get
him
a
big
of
good
shape
not
long
and
spindling
but
stout
and
with
a
pointed
tip
for
the
big
house
was
in
the
city
and
of
course
no
city
trees
could
be
cut
down
without
folks
being
put
into
jail
for
it
and
then
everybody
had
to
sit
down
and
count
up
the
money
they
had
to
spend
and
if
that
wasn
t
enough
they
had
to
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
out
some
more
that
is
the
big
folks
did
and
as
the
children
were
emptying
their
banks
to
see
how
much
they
had
grandpapa
came
up
behind
them
and
dropped
a
gold
dollar
into
each
one
s
it
was
impossible
for
the
five
little
peppers
to
keep
still
at
that
but
after
they
were
quiet
once
more
polly
occasioned
a
fresh
outburst
by
saying
and
then
grandmamma
came
up
behind
them
and
she
dropped
a
gold
dollar
on
each
pile
polly
cried
little
davie
quite
overcome
did
they
have
the
tree
too
yes
child
said
polly
and
dear
me
lots
of
other
things
too
a
big
christmas
dinner
for
one
o
polly
cried
joel
turkey
and
pudding
o
my
yes
and
candy
and
raisins
and
everything
declared
polly
with
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
and
roast
beef
and
fixings
ben
for
the
life
of
him
could
not
help
asking
this
yes
yes
answered
polly
you
can
t
think
of
anything
that
those
children
didn
t
have
at
that
christmas
dinner
but
i
must
tell
you
about
the
tree
well
you
must
see
it
took
a
great
while
to
get
everything
ready
besides
the
things
that
jenny
and
her
cousin
mary
and
jenny
s
brother
tom
and
his
cousin
edward
were
making
there
were
ever
so
many
presents
to
buy
and
to
get
these
all
the
children
had
to
go
to
the
shops
with
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
and
with
each
other
and
then
they
had
to
hide
them
in
all
the
places
they
could
so
that
no
one
would
find
them
until
they
were
hanging
on
the
christmas
tree
oh
there
was
just
everything
to
do
and
the
day
before
christmas
they
all
went
to
the
shops
for
the
last
things
that
had
been
forgotten
till
then
it
had
snowed
the
night
before
but
it
was
sunny
and
cheery
on
this
afternoon
and
the
walks
had
a
little
bit
of
snow
too
hard
to
clear
off
nicely
and
just
enough
to
slide
on
when
the
procession
came
out
of
the
big
house
and
turned
down
the
street
where
the
shops
were
everybody
was
out
buying
things
they
had
little
bags
of
money
dangling
by
their
sides
only
some
held
their
purses
in
their
hands
and
kept
looking
at
them
to
be
sure
they
were
there
but
oh
the
shops
tell
about
them
begged
all
the
other
peppers
together
tell
every
single
thing
that
was
in
them
said
joel
oh
i
can
t
begin
to
tell
half
that
was
in
those
shops
laughed
polly
merrily
mercy
me
joey
there
was
just
everything
there
drums
and
tin
soldiers
and
little
boxes
that
had
music
shut
up
in
em
and
dolls
and
and
mittens
and
comforters
and
trains
of
cars
and
candy
and
flowers
and
birds
in
cages
and
oh
boots
and
shoes
and
books
and
oh
just
polly
brought
up
suddenly
with
a
gasp
being
quite
tired
out
go
on
urged
joel
breathlessly
she
can
t
there
s
too
many
things
said
ben
never
mind
going
over
them
just
tell
what
the
folks
did
well
you
see
the
children
each
wanted
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
to
help
them
choose
things
that
all
the
others
were
not
to
see
said
polly
and
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
couldn
t
go
in
seven
places
at
once
so
at
last
one
of
them
it
was
tom
thought
of
a
plan
it
was
to
rush
off
himself
and
choose
something
and
then
come
running
back
down
the
and
when
the
others
all
saw
him
coming
they
were
to
hurry
away
from
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
and
let
him
whisper
what
it
was
into
their
ears
so
nobody
else
heard
and
would
you
and
then
if
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
said
yes
away
tom
would
rush
and
buy
it
whatever
it
was
so
all
the
other
children
tried
the
very
same
plan
and
don
t
you
believe
when
they
asked
would
you
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
always
said
yes
my
they
did
every
single
time
well
and
finally
they
came
out
of
the
last
shop
and
the
lamps
in
the
street
were
being
lighted
and
the
snow
under
their
feet
shone
and
creaked
as
they
stepped
and
every
one
of
the
children
would
have
slidden
if
their
arms
had
not
been
full
of
bundles
clear
up
to
their
chins
and
grandpapa
laughed
and
said
they
ought
to
have
brought
an
express
wagon
and
grandmamma
said
oh
no
she
wouldn
t
have
them
sent
home
if
she
could
it
was
so
nice
to
carry
and
everybody
they
met
had
big
and
little
white
paper
parcels
and
people
knocked
into
each
other
the
streets
were
so
crowded
and
the
bundles
stuck
out
so
and
so
finally
they
got
home
and
all
the
bundles
were
put
in
one
big
room
where
the
tree
was
and
the
door
was
locked
and
grandmamma
put
the
key
in
her
black
silk
pocket
well
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
that
big
house
was
still
as
could
be
all
the
children
were
asleep
in
their
beds
something
came
softly
over
the
roof
and
stopped
right
by
the
chimney
there
was
just
a
little
like
the
noise
henderson
s
cow
makes
when
she
shakes
her
bell
and
then
a
just
like
one
of
tisbett
s
horses
when
he
puts
his
foot
down
quietly
the
gray
one
i
mean
and
somebody
said
hush

up
the

he
went
into

and
now
she
hid
her
face
on
polly

arm
while
soft
little
sobs
shook
her
figure

joel
thrusting
his
head
up
quickly
and
wiping
his
wet
face
on
polly
s
gown
yes

t
think
how
good
teddy

all
through
that
year
said
polly
happily
his
mother
called
him
little
comfort
and
his
father
said
he
was
a
little
that
s
nice
said
joel
smiling
through
his
tears
phronsie
when
she
saw
that
joel
was
all
right
and
that
no
one
else
was
crying
lifted
up
her
head
from
polly
s
arm
and
laughed
gleefully
so
on
polly
ran
with
the
story
well
and
after
santa
claus
had
gone
for
you
know
he
had
so
many
other
children
to
go
to
see
and
it
was
pink
all
over
the
sky
and
the
children
were
out
of
bed
why
it
was
the
hardest
thing
to
keep
them
out
of
that
room
where
the
tree
was
and
that
day
oh
it
was
the
very
longest
in
all
the
days
of
the
year
but
at
last
it
was
night
and
then
the
candles
on
the
tree
were
all
lighted
oh
i
guess
there
were
two
hundred
of
them
and
they
gleamed
out
such
a
sparkling
brightness
just
like
little
stars
and
two
hundred
candles
polly
cried
every
one
yes
said
polly
i
surely
believe
there
were
two
hundred
candles
all
lighted
and
winking
away
on
that
beautiful
tree
and
somebody
the
children
s
mother
i
believe
played
on
the
piano
and
everybody
marched
in
line
and
the
big
door
was
thrown
open
and
there
with
its
tip
almost
to
the
top
of
the
room
was
the
most
beautiful
tree
and
every
branch
was
crowded
with
presents
and
everybody
got
what
was
most
wanted
and
there
were
flowers
everywhere
oh
and
a
little
bird
sang
they
d
put
the
cage
at
the
bottom
of
the
tree
because
it
was
too
heavy
for
the
branches
and
there
sat
his
black
eyes
as
big
as
could
be
and
he
was
stretching
his
throat
and
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
then
everybody
took
hold
of
hands
and
danced
around
and
around
that
most
beautiful
tree
a
whole
hour
i
guess
and
santa
claus
all
the
while
was
peeking
in
at
the
window
you
see
he
goes
around
the
next
night
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
to
see
how
the
children
like
his
presents
o
children
and
polly
glanced
out
of
the
window
if
here
doesn
t
come
beebe
vi
father
kangaroo
and
the
fat
little
bird
phronsie
was
wailing
dismally
sitting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
old
bed
her
face
pricked
she
said
and
she
was
rubbing
it
vigorously
with
both
fat
little
hands
and
then
crying
worse
than

phronsie
but
mamsie
couldn
t
come
she
was
sewing
away
for
dear
life
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
so
polly
curled
up
on
the
bed
beside
phronsie
and
fed
her
mouthfuls
of
the
toast
with
its
unwonted
richness
the
sweet
butter
that
henderson
the
parson
s
wife
sent
over
while
she
told
the
doings
of
all
the
chickens
in
the
hendersons
then
gayly
launched
off
into
other
stories
and
this
is
one
of
the
stories
she
told
you
must
know
began
polly
briskly
as
phronsie
leaned
back
against
the
pillow
the
last
morsel
of
toast
despatched
that
the
children
had
never
seen
a
kangaroo
and
keep
your
toes

phronsie
and
polly
jumped
off
the
bed
and
gave
a
quick
pull
at
the
oh

dreadful
old
measles

catch
phronsie
pulled
in
her
fat
little
toes
where
she
had
stuck
them
out
from
the
edge
of
the
patched
and
huddled
them
under
her
in
terror
they
re
so
hot
polly
she
wailed
oh

they
polly
hugging

out
phronsie
there

anything

polly
asked
phronsie
fearfully
still
huddling
up
in
a
heap
no

come
on
mister
toes
sang
polly
gayly
pulling
at
them
doctor
said
you
mustn
t
get
cold
or
the
measles
would
run
in
there
that
s
all
right
as
phronsie
s
toes
came
down
again
now
everything
s
just
splendid
and
i
ll
go
on
about
my
lovely
kangaroo
he

sighed
phronsie
wriggling
all
her
toes
and
they
prick
polly
they
do
well
we
can
t
help
that
said
polly
you

toes
too
sometimes
phronsie
now
i
m
going
to
get
up
on
the
bed
again
and
hold
your
hand
and
then

polly
hopped
up
beside
phronsie
and
took
her
hot
little
hand
in
both
of
her
bigger
ones
and
began
again
you
see
he
please

t
let
him

the
the
broke
in
phronsie
turning
her
flushed
face
eagerly
toward
polly
s
on
the
pillow
don
t
polly
she
begged
have
the
what
cried
polly
racking
her
brains
to
think
what
she
could
do
with
her
kangaroo
she
must
tell
phronsie
a
good
story
about
him
well
i
ve
seen
the
picture
of
him
in
the
minister
s
book
and
i
guess
i
can
make
up
something
about
him
that
she
ll
like
what
is
it
that
you
want
me
not
to
do
to
him
phronsie
she
asked
don
t
let
him
have
th
these
things
like
mine
pleaded
phronsie
the
tears
coming
into
the
brown
eyes
and
despite
all
her
efforts
she
wriggled
her
toes
and
cried
oh
it
pricks
so
polly
burrowing
down
deep
in
the
old
bed
and
rubbing
her
chubby
face
oh
he
sha
n
t
have
the
measles
cried
polly
and
you
mustn
t
do
so
phronsie
all
in
one
breath
and
pulling
phronsie
up
against
the
pillow
again
polly
seized
both
of
the
little
fat
hands
and
held
them
close
there
there
just
hear
all
about
my
lovely
kangaroo
phronsie
why
he
ran
into
the
forest
and
he
carried
all
the
little
bits
of
kangarooses
in
a
bag
with
did
he
have
a
bag
asked
phronsie
and
she
let
her
hands
stay
quite
still
in
polly
s
clasp
and
the
two
tears
on
her
round
cheeks
ran
down
on
the
old
quilt
unheeded
yes
indeed
a
big
bag
that
hung
down
in
front
of
him
and
whenever
he
called
all
his
little
children
kangarooses
would
run
and
hop
and
jump
into
that
oh
screamed
phronsie
delightedly
yes
and
then
the
old
father
kangaroo
would
peek
over
the
edge
of
the
bag
and
say
lie
still
my
children
and
don
t
kick
each
other
and
then
he
did
he
tie
it
asked
phronsie
anxiously
and
poking
up
her
head
to
peer
into
polly
s
face
please
don
t
let
him
tie
it
tight
no
he
couldn
t
tie
it
said
polly
because
you
see
there
were
no
strings
to
his
oh
said
phronsie
sinking
back
very
much
relieved
he
gripped
the
edges
together
fast
and
but
the
little
kangarooses
had
cunning
little
places
they
could
stick
their
noses
out
she
hastened
to
add
as
she
caught
sight
of
phronsie
s
face
oh
they
liked
it
ever
so
much
and
then
the
old
father
kangaroo
would
run
oh
such
dreadful
big
steps
he
would
take
phronsie
you
can
t
think
as
big
as
all
across
this
bed
in
one
hop
phronsie
s
eyes
widened
delightedly
and
she
gave
a
long
sigh
of
content
tell
me
some
more
she
begged
well
one
day
father
kangaroo
was
out
in
the
forest
getting
dinner
he
had
short
little
wee
feet
in
front
and
he
couldn
t
walk
very
fast
you
see
and
where
was
the
mother
kan
what
was
it
polly
interrupted
phronsie
tell
me
polly
kangaroo
oh
she
was
in
the
house
working
away
you
see
with
so
many
phronsie
there
was
lots
and
lots
to
do
said
polly
growing
quite
desperate
at
the
thought
of
mother
pepper
sewing
out
there
in
the
old
kitchen
and
all
the
dishes
not
yet
washed
and
everything
else
at
a
standstill
now
you
lie
still
and
perhaps
you
ll
go
to
sleep
while
i
tell
the
i
can
t
go
to
sleep
said
phronsie
putting
up
her
lip
sorrowfully
never
mind
said
polly
merrily
don
t
oh
where
was
i
you
said
father
kangaroo
went
off
to
get
some
dinner
said
phronsie
concluding
not
to
cry
oh
yes
well
you
see
they
hadn
t
any
of
them
had
any
breakfast
just
think
of
that
phronsie
and
you
ve
had
toast
and
elegant
butter
and
polly
s
mouth
watered
for
she
hadn
t
tasted
any
of
the
little
pat
that
henderson
sent
hadn
t
they
asked
phronsie
sadly
no
not
a
single
bite
well
father
kangaroo
just
stalked
off
that
is
he
hopped
with
great
big
hops
for
he
knew
he
had
to
get
some
dinner
else
the
little
bits
of
kangarooses
would
starve
to
death
and
pretty
soon
he
came
right
into
the
very
middle
of
the
forest
and
there
under
the
trees
in
the
midst
of
a
lay
a
little
bird
oh
such
a
cunning
little
bird
you
can
t
think
phronsie
so
fat
and
juicy
oh
don
t
let
father
kangaroo
catch
the
little
bird
polly
screamed
phronsie
in
terror
and
springing
up
she
seized
polly
s
neck
with
both
hands
and
burst
into
tears
oh
dear
me
what
shall
i
do
cried
polly
in
despair
and
cuddling
her
up
no
he
sha
n
t
eat
the
bird
phronsie
now
stop
crying
this
minute
the
kangaroo
sha
n
t
eat
him
i
say
i
ll
make
the
little
bird
go
home
with
him
and
sing
to
the
children
kangarooses
there
there
now
says
i
we
ll
lie
down
so
she
patted
and
tucked
phronsie
in
again
under
the
clothes
and
wiped
her
face
dry
with
the
old
soft
handkerchief
mamsie
had

polly
well
then
you

the
big
father

fat
bird
so
he
said
now
my
dear

t
you
want

fly
out
of
my
bag
and
go
home
and
the
little
fat
bird
huddled
down
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
bag
and
he
piped
out
oh

haven
t

kangaroo
a
great
cross
old
squirrel
came
up
to
my
nest
this

i
flew

and

the
oh

cried
phronsie
in
dismay
but
wasn
t
it
good
that
father
kangaroo
found
the
fat
little
bird
cried
polly
in
her
cheeriest
fashion
yes
said
phronsie
it
was
good
well
so
father
kangaroo
said
i
ll
take
you
to
my
he
didn
t
know
what
in
all
the
world
he
should
do
for
he
had
six
no
seven
hungry
little
kangarooses
and
not
a
bit
to
give
them
for
dinner
but
he
couldn
t
leave
the
poor
little
fat
bird
to
starve
you
he
was
a
good
father
kan
what
is
it
polly
declared
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
kangaroo
yes
wasn
t
he
phronsie
so
he
looked
down
into
the
bag
and
he
said
now
don
t
you
cry
little
bird
and
you
shall
go
home
with
me
where
the
cross
old
squirrels
can
not
catch
you
for
he
thought
he
heard
the
little
fat
bird
sobbing
down
in
the
dark
and
was
he
cried
phronsie
perhaps
so
a
little
wee
bit
but
he
didn
t
cry
any
more
for
as
soon
as
he
heard
father
kangaroo
say
that
he
chirped
out
thank
you
and
i
ll
sing
for
you
all
the
day
that
was
nice
in
the
little
bird
wasn
t
it
polly
cried
phronsie
wiggling
her
toes
in
a
satisfied
way
yes
indeed
well
so
away
they
trudged
i
mean
father
kangaroo
trudged
and
hopped
and
skipped
with
great
long
steps
and
pretty
soon
he
came
to
his
home
and
the
little
kangarooses
saw
him
coming
and
they
all
ran
and
hopped
out
to
meet
him
screaming
o
pappy
have
you
brought
us
our
dinner
oh
dear
said
phronsie
very
much
troubled
he
hadn
t
any
but
just
think
what
a
dear
sweet
little
fat
bird
he
had
brought
them
who
was
going
to
sing
all
day
long
phronsie
yes
said
phronsie
but
she
sighed
tell
me
some
more
polly
well
so
father
kangaroo
didn
t
say
anything
about
dinner
for
he
thought
if
they
saw
the
little
bird
first
and
heard
him
sing
they
would
forget
all
about
that
they
were
and
did
they
asked
phronsie
yes
indeed
they
never
thought
of
it
again
and
they
hopped
and
danced
all
around
the
fat
little
bird
and
he
told
them
of
good
father
kangaroo
who
had
saved
him
when
he
got
caught
in
the
where
he
fell
when
he
flew
away
from
the
cruel
squirrel
and
then
he
sang
oh
it
was
just
lovely
to
hear
him
sing
polly
lay
back
upon
the
pillow
and
folded
her
hands
lost
in
thought
tell
me
some
more
polly
cried
phronsie
pulling
her
sleeve
oh
yes
well
then
you
see
all
that
noise
brought
mother
kangaroo
in
and
she
just
held
up
her
paws
in
astonishment
and
she
didn
t
like
it
very
well
and
she
said
what
bring
another
hungry
mouth
to
feed
and
you
haven
t
any
dinner
for
us
and
father
kangaroo
sat
down
in
the
corner
and
his
big
head
went
down
on
his
breast
and
he
sat
still
to
don
t
let
mother
kangaroo
send
the
poor
little
bird
away
polly
don
t
let
her
do
it
protested
phronsie
in
distress
no
i
won
t
promised
polly
well
when
mother
kangaroo
saw
father
kangaroo
sitting
so
sad
and
still
over
in
the
corner
she
hopped
over
to
him
and
put
both
her
paws
around
his
neck
and
she
kissed
his
furry
cheek
the
little
bird
shall
stay
she
said
and
i
ll
go
out
and
get
some
and
all
the
little
took
hold
of
paws
and
danced
around
the
fat
little
bird
in
oh
oh
cried
phronsie
in
delight
mercy
me
exclaimed
pepper
putting
her
head
in
the
doorway
i
thought
phronsie
was
worse
now
that
s
cosey
and
she
beamed
at
polly
in
a
way
that
made
the
little
sunbeams
sink
right
down

heart
vii

kitchen
table
and
mamsie
brought
her
big
basket
and
seraphina
s
bonnet

snipped
out

so
long
waiting

bits
of
bright
paper
from

the
bedroom
and
ben
got
out
his
big
and
commenced
to
whittle
bravely
and
everything
was
as
brisk
as
a
bee
and
as
cheery
and
the
tongues
flew
just
as
fast
as
the
fingers
till
the
little
old
kitchen
was
alive
with
the
work
of
getting
ready
for
christmas
illustration
the
two
pulled
out
the
kitchen
table
but
on
the
next
morning
all
the
signs
of
the
coming
festivity
tucked
carefully
away
and
the
work
done
up
then
didn
t
polly
just
have
to
spin
off
a
story
when
in
marched
joel
with
a
come
on
dave
polly
s
sewing
now
for
the
story
he
whooped
and
threw
himself
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
o
joel
polly
was
just
ready
to
cry
out
i
can
t
think
of
a
and
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
promised
dear
me
joe
what
do
you
want
she
asked
and
making
her
needle
fly
faster
than
ever
oh
something
nice
about
having
joel
smacked
his
lips
and
bears
and
wolves
and
crocodiles
tell
a
good
one
polly
and
it
s
got
to
be
long
he
waved
his
arms
as
far
as
he
could
long
as
that
now
i
ll
tell
about
a
said
polly
wrinkling
her
brows
that
s
the
first
thing
you
asked
for
and
and
bears
and
wolves
and
crocodiles
said
joel
hastily
i
want
all
those
you
ve
got
to
polly
cause
i
go
to
bed
every
night
and
you
said
you
i
can
t
get
all
those
things
into
one
story
said
polly
hoh
yes
you
can
contradicted
joel
that
s
just
as
easy
now
begin
well
once
there
was
a
boy
said
polly
with
a
flourish
of
her
needle
as
she
put
in
a
new
thread
and
his
mother
had
to
hide
the
whenever
she
baked
any
cause
she
was
afraid
to
leave
em
round
and
don
t
tell
such
a
story
howled
joel
in
disgust
tell
something
nice
he
winked
his
black
eyes
fast
and
polly
thought
she
saw
something
shine
in
them
and
then
he
dug
his
fists
in
them
and
hid
his
stubby
head
on
her
lap
in
among
her
sewing
so
i
will
joey
she
cried
dropping
her
work
to
lean
over
and
drop
a
kiss
on
his
black
hair
and
then
it
all
came
to
her
what
to
say
and
before
she
knew
it
she
had
begun
again
on
the
wonderful
boy
and
the
you
see
it
was
long
long
ago
ran
on
polly
in
her
gayest
fashion
and
almost
anything
could
have
happened
then
why
adolphus
lived
ages
before
this
time
when
we
are
living
in
badgertown
so
he
had
all
sorts
of
funny
people
as
his
neighbors
and
they
did
all
kinds
of
queer
things
and
the
animals
all
talked
just
like
boys
and
girls
and
everybody
understood
them
and
it
was
just
the
strangest
world
you
can
t
think
and
that
s
the
reason
that
the
story
is
just
as
it
go
on
said
joel
quite
himself
again
and
his
mouth
opened
in
an
expansive
smile
come
on
dave
polly
s
going
to
tell
an
elegant
buster
of
a
joel
i
sha
n
t
tell
a
single
thing
if
you
say
such
dreadful
words
declared
polly
sternly
as
little
david
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
by
joel
s
side
i
won
t
cried
joel
in
alarm
say
it
again
ever
think
how
badly
mamsie
would
feel
to
hear
it
said
polly
reprovingly
o
joe
how
can
you
down
went
joel
s
head
on
her
lap
i
won
t
again
polly
he
burst
out
trying
not
to
cry
o
polly
i
won
t
i
don
t
want
mamsie
to
feel
bad
and
he
burrowed
deep
in
her
lap
he
won
t
polly
said
little
david
anxiously
patting
joel
s
stubby
head
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
pulling
polly
s
gown
i
most
know
he
won
t
say
any
more
dreadful
see
that
you
don
t
then
joe
said
polly
and
both
of
you
boys
must
remember
that
it
would
make
mamsie
sick
to
hear
you
say
any
such
things
well
now
for
the
story
the
wonderful
boy
and
the
oh
oh
cried
davie
in
a
transport
and
clasping
his
hands
joel
sat
up
quite
straight
and
held
his
breath
the
boy
lived
in
an
old
stone
house
began
polly
all
overgrown
with
vines
there
were
big
trees
that
sent
their
arms
clear
across
the
top
of
his
house
and
the
vines
ran
all
over
them
so
that
it
looked
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
was
a
great
arbor
well
and
just
a
little
ways
off
about
as
far
as
from
here
to
grandma
bascom
s
was
a
gre
at
big
cave
and
that
was
all
grown
over
with
vines
too
and
funny
dangling
trees
that
looked
as
if
they
were
upside
oh
laughed
joel
how
funny
and
how
funny
said
little
david
yes
but
it
wasn
t
half
so
funny
as
it
was
inside
of
the
house
and
the
cave
said
polly
sewing
away
busily
because
you
see
the
man
who
was
adolphus
s
father
owned
all
the
wild
beasts
that
were
in
the
cave
and
as
he
had
them
all
brought
out
of
the
cave
and
up
to
the
big
house
sometimes
when
he
had
company
and
he
wanted
to
amuse
them
why
you
know
everything
was
made
so
they
might
show
off
and
the
people
could
have
a
good
tell
about
it
cried
joel
crowding
up
to
polly
s
work
so
closely
that
she
couldn
t
see
where
to
set
her
stitches
take
care
joe
she
warned
i
sewed
that
crooked
atkins
won
t
give
mamsie
any
more
sacks
to
do
if
they
re
done
badly
and
i
want
to
learn
to
sew
them
all
for
and
polly
s
face
was
very
sad
as
she
picked
out
the
poor
work
joel
huddled
out
of
the
way
in
dismay
there
that
s
all
right
now
announced
polly
in
a
minute
you
didn
t
do
any
mischief
joe
let
me
see
where
was
i
you
said
adolphus
s
father
had
all
the
wild
beasts
brought
out
of
the
cave
and
into
the
house
when
he
had
company
cried
joel
oh
make
him
bring
em
all
in
now
polly
do
so
he
shall
nodded
polly
you
see
boys
adolphus
s
father
had
lots
and
lots
of
animals
in
his
cave
but
he
liked
the
wolves
and
the
bears
and
the
crocodiles
the
oh
dear
me
said
davie
quite
overcome
now
adolphus
liked
the
best
thing
in
the
world
yes
the
very
best
thing
in
all
the
world
and
he
had
it
for
breakfast
dinner
and
whick
oh
dear
me
exploded
joel
yes
all
the
beasts
liked
too
every
single
one
of
all
those
sixteen
hundred
were
there
sixteen
hundred
of
em
cried
little
david
with
flaming
cheeks
and
pushing
up
close
to
her
work
yes
said
polly
recklessly
adolphus
s
father

sixteen
hundred
wild
beasts
in
his
cave
and

joel

firmly
he

a
single
one
more
than

hundred

a
single
one
well

said
joel
but
the
beasts
couldn
t
get
any
ever
said
polly
hurrying
on
why
broke
in
both
of
the
boys
because
adolphus
s
mother
said
that
she
couldn
t
spend
the
time
to
bake
for
so
many
beasts
and
beastesses
because
you
see
all
the
animals
would
have
to
have
a
pie
apiece
and
adolphus
used
to
go
out
into
the
front
yard
and
eat
his
pie
and
all
the
creatures
would
come
out
of
their
cave
and
stand
in
their
yard
and
lick
their
chops
and
wish
they
had
and
so
do
i
wish
i
had
some
polly
declared
joel
licking
his
mouth
did
it
have
plums
in
polly
gre
at
big
ones
declared
polly
oh
so
rich
and
juicy
my
there
never
was
such
a
pie
as
those
that
adolphus
got
every
day
one
for
breakfast
and
one
for
dinner
and
one
for
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
both
boys
again
unable
to
find
other
words
well
one
day
there

one
of
the
wolves
ran
up

ears
nobody

he
is
afraid
here
he
cried
yes

are
going
to
have

it
was
impossible
to
describe
the
excitement
that
now
seized
the
two
boys
as
they
huddled
closer
and
closer
to
polly
as
she
hurried
on
and
when
all
the
beasts
and
beastesses
had
promised
to
do
just
as
the
white
polar
bear
should
tell
them
he
roared
at

perfectly
dreadful
voice

i

scrunch
your
heads
off
if

so
they
all
said
it
after
him
the
crocodile
weeping
great
tears
that
ran
over
his
cheeks
as
he
repeated
the
words
and
then
every
animal
went
to
bed
and
the
next
night
the
company
came
to
the
big
house
under
the
vines
and
adolphus
s
father
sent
for
all
the
beasts
and
and
did
they
scrunch
their
heads
off
screamed
joel

cried
joel
lowering
his
voice
oh

all
their
heads
every
single
one
you
must
wait
and
see
said
polly
and
don
t
interrupt
or
i
never
will
get
a
chance
to
tell
the
story
well
all
the
animals
went
up
to
adolphus
s
house
two
by
two
and
there
in
the
long
hall
sat
all
the
company
in
tall
chairs
and
adolphus
in
the
middle
and
the
first
thing
that
anybody
knew
before
one
of
them
was
asked
to
perform
a
single
thing
the
white
cat
that
lived
up
at
the
big
house
and
always
slept
on
a
white
satin
cushion
and
drank
from
a
silver
bowl
sprang
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
and
made
a
bow
and
a
curtsey
she
had
a
green
ribbon
embroidered
in
silver
tied
under
her
chin
and
she
looked
too
perfectly
splendid
for
anything
my
master
wishes
me
to
say
she
announced
with
another
low
bow
down
to
the
ground
that
you
are
asked
over
not
to
show
off
but
to
eat
behold
and
there
right
at
her
elbow
were
boys
dressed
in
green
and
scarlet
and
all
with
big
trays
full
of
with
plums
sticking
out
all
over
them
and
ugh
grunted
joel
and
kicking
his
heels
in
great
disgust
now
the
white
polar
bear
can
t
scrunch
those
people
s
heads
off
hoh
that
s
no

viii
the
cunning
little
duck
the
little

joel
with
a
gusto

bunch
of

shouted
at
the
idea
of

s
being

and
joel
got
up
and
whirled
around
clapping
his
fists
together
till
the
old
kitchen

with
the
noise

a
big

more

and
all
trimmed
with
beautiful
lace

crinkling
up
the
paper
on
her
head
to
make
it
look
as
much
like
an
old
lady

cap
as
possible
and
nearly
putting

polly
coming
entirely
out
from
under
her
big
paper
cap
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
when
polly
looked
like
that
it
always
made
them
think
of
mamsie
so
joel
turned
at
once
and
went
slowly
down
the
steps
to
the
provision
room
dragging
the
after
him
he
soon
came
back

little
red
hand
and
soon
polly

cap
was
tied
on
in
the
most
approved
style
amid
the
shouts
of
the
children
who
all
escorted
her
to
the
cracked
over
the
bedroom
bureau
when
she
pronounced
it

absorbed
little
face

to
the
word
and
twisting
his

of
a
knot
as

a
cunning
little

and
she
put
out
her
little
hands
as
if
she
had
the
duck
between
them
but

a
peck
of
trouble
cried
poor
polly
picking
frantically
at
the
bad

then
her
old
paper
cap
with
its
deep
border
slid
down
over
her
eyes
and

midst
of

boys
go
and
tell
dear
beebe
all
about
it
while
i
take
her
in
my
lap
and
fix
that
duck
s
so
joel
and
david
very
important
at
the
piece
of
work
set
them
ran
over
and
poured
the
whole
recital
into
good
beebe
s
ear
how
polly
was
playing
grandmother
and
they
hadn
t
anything
to
make
a
cap
of
but
an
old
piece
of
brown
paper
that
came
around
the
sacks
from
the
store
that
pepper
brought
home
to
sew
and
how
the
old
thing
kept
tumbling
over
polly
s
nose
so
that
she
sewed
up
the
seam
wrong
and
she
was
trying
to
pick
it
out
because
you
see
she
had
to
get
it
done
before
mamsie
got
home
who
had
gone
to
the
minister
s
to
help
henderson
make
her
soft
soap
and
how
phronsie
almost
cried
because
polly
said
the
little
duck
s
leg
was
bent
in
the
grass
because
maybe
the
cat
stepped
on
it
and
how
that
was
the
reason
polly
was
talking
to
her
now
and
fixing
the
leg
up
and
oh
dear
me
all
this
and
much
more
good
beebe
oh
ing
and
ah
ing
at
just
the
right
times
and
that
s
all
announced
little
david
at
last
flushed
and
important
joel
hung
his
head
no
it
isn
t
he
blurted
out
i
was
you
were
bad
echoed
beebe
oh
no
i
guess
not
she
said
soothingly
yes
i
was
said
joel
stoutly
i
scuffled
davie
and
got
the
david
shifted
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
he
put
it
back
he
said
polly
made
me
said
joel
twisting
his
mouth
not
to
cry
and
with
an
eye
to
the
big
basket
which
was
not
for
naughty
boys
oh
dear
me
old
beebe
cast
a
puzzled
glance
at
him
but
was
saved
the
necessity
of
replying
for
old
beebe
came
in
just
then
rubbing
his
hands
well
how
are
you
all
my
pretty
dears
i
can
t
stay
a
minute
for
my
shop

basket
and
then
come
out
an
get
in
the
beebe
gave
a
sigh
dear
me
she
said
i
wish
i
could
set
awhile
but
then
there
s
the
so
she
got
out
of
her
chair
and
began
to
undo
the
basket
and
polly
with
phronsie
radiant
and
hanging
to
her
hand
came
running
up
and
they
all
crowded
around
the
good
woman
and
old
beebe
laughed
and
shook
his
fat
sides
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
worse
than
ever
and
at
last
all
the
things
were
out
and
on
the
table
ready
to
surprise
mamsie
with
when
she
came
home
and
i
guess
if
one
of
you
will
feel
in
my
pockets
he
said
at
last
when
his
wife
clapped
to
the
cover
of
the
empty
basket
p
raps
maybe
now
you
d
find
something
you
d
let
david
said
joel
swallowing
hard
no
let
phronsie
said
little
david
so
phronsie
went
up
to
old
beebe
who
lifted
her
into
a
chair
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
pockets
in
his
and
oh
oh
first
she
drew
out
slowly
a
pink
stick
and
then
a
great
thick
white
one
of
peppermint
candy
and
then
midst
a
babel
of
thanks
from
the
five
little
peppers
and
one
or
two
kisses
from
old
and
beebe
away
the
big
empty
basket
and
the
two
good
people
went
to
their
wagon
i
m
sure
said
polly
to
herself
long
after
they
had
danced
and
danced
around
the
table
with
its
good
things
none
of
them
care
for
the
little
duck
now
so
i
can
fly
to
my
sewing
and
have
a
good
time
to
pick
it
out
and
do
it
so
she
settled
herself
in
the
old
chair
in
the
corner
the
children
in
great
excitement
still
circling
around
the
gifts
which
they
were
not
to
touch
till
mamsie
got
home
i
choose
that
said
joel
smacking
his
lips
that
big
fat
doughnut
all
crisp
and
brown
o
whickets
joel
said
polly
over
in
her
corner
what
did
you
say
joel
hung
his
head
and
i
choose
that
said
davie
pointing
to
some
gingerbread
dark
and
moist
while
he
carefully
licked
the
remnant
of
pink
stick
in
his
hand
for
phronsie
had
insisted
on
sharing
her
candy
with
them
all
the
minute
the
beebes
had
gotten
into
their
green
wagon
what
do
you
choose
phronsie
i
like
this
said
phronsie
holding
up
a
sticky
wad
of
pink
stick
in
her
fat
little
hand
and
smiling
with
a
very
much
smeared
face
oh
deary
me
cried
polly
at
sight
of
her
well
i
s
pose
it
s
no
use
to
wash
her
up
till

s
all

well
i
am
thankful
i
didn
t
have
to
tell
all
the
rest
about
that
dreadful
little
ix
the
old
the
rain
dripped
most
dismally
on
the
roof
of
the
little
brown
house
it
had
rained
just
so
without
any
appearance
of
stopping
for
three
days
and
phronsie
held
a
sad
little
face
against
the
won
t
it
ever
stop
polly
she
asked
yes
i
s
pose
so
said
polly
dismally
though
i
don
t
know
when
mamsie
did
you
ever
see
it
rain
so
long
dear
me
yes
said
pepper
looking
up
from
her
over
in
the
corner
plenty
of
times
polly
if
folks
don
t
worry
over
the
weather
and
talk
about
it
it
s
all
right
fly
at
your
baking
child
and
let
the
rain
take
care
of
illustration
dear
me
yes
said
mrs
pepper
it
s
so
dark
said
polly
discontentedly
we
can
t
see
anything
as
she
went
into
the
buttery
for
the
flour
it
s
so
dark
grumbled
joel
trying
to
make
a
box
over
in
the
corner
and
catching
her
tone
can
t
see
davie
sighed
and
went
over
to
his
mother
s
corner
and
stood
there
with
a
very
long
face
there
now
you
see
polly
said
pepper
as
polly
came
back
with
the
and
the
and
set
them
on
the
kitchen
table
polly
looked
around
the
kitchen
with
a
startled
air
oh
i
m
awfully
sorry
she
cried
a
wave
of
color
flying
up
to
her
brown
hair
mamsie
i
truly
then
she
rushed
over
to
joel
who
was
banging
petulantly
at
a
refractory
nail
look
out
you
ll
pound
your
thumb
and
she
kneeled
down
beside
him
don
t
care
said
joel
crossly
can
t
see
anything
mean
old
rain
spoils
joel
it
was
mother
pepper
who
spoke
and
her
black
eyes
flashed
sternly
that
s
wicked
don
t
you
let
me
hear
you
say
such
things
o
mamsie
began
polly
and
a
boy
who
talks
about
the
rain
in
such
a
way
is
not
only
wicked
but
foolish
i
think
he
had
better
go
into
the
provision
room
and
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
and
think
by
himself
for
a
o
exclaimed
polly
imploringly
go
straight
along
joey
said
pepper
and
when
you
feel
right
about
it
you
may
come
joel
laid
down
his
clumsy
hammer
and
his
round
face
working
dreadfully
he
stumbled
off
and
down
the
rickety
steps
and
presently
they
could
hear
him
shut
the
old
door
fast
o
mamsie
mamsie
polly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
rushed
tumultuously
across
the
room
and
threw
herself
at
pepper
s
feet
it
s
all
my
fault
she
sobbed
burying
her
face
in
the
apron
and
i
am
the
one
who
ought
to
be
sent
into
the
provision
you
re
too
big
to
send
there
polly
said
pepper
sadly
why
you
re
ten
years
she
laid
down
her
mending
and
her
hands
smoothed
the
brown
hair
gently
but
i
made
joel
say
the
bad
things
cried
polly
gustily
her
shoulders
shaking
with
her
efforts
not
to
cry
aloud
phronsie
who
had
turned
in
her
chair
where
she
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
unusual
disturbance
in
the
old
kitchen
now
got
down
very
gravely
and
came
over
to
mother
pepper
s
corner
what
is
the
matter
with
polly
she
asked
with
wide
disapproving
eyes
mamsie
will
take
care
of
polly
said
pepper
she
s
sick
i
guess
said
little
davie
wonderingly
at
that
phronsie
uttered
a
low
cry
oh
don
t
let
my
polly
be
sick
don
t
let
her
mamsie
then
she
screamed
in
dismay
polly
said
mother
pepper
putting
the
stockings
into
the
big
with
a
hasty
hand
and
drawing
phronsie
to
her
lap
now
i
guess
you
ll
have
to
do
your
best
my
child
to
set
matters
there
there
phronsie
stop
screaming
polly
s
all
polly
felt
for
the
first
minute
as
if
she
could
never
lift
her
head
and
speak
cheerily
to
the
children
oh
how
much
she
would
give
to
be
phronsie
s
age
and
be
cuddled
and
allowed
to
have
her
cry
out
but
mamsie
s
words
she
swallowed
hard
the
terrible
lump
in
her
throat
wiped
off
the
tears
and
said
brokenly
i
m
all
right
there
see
pet
and
put
up
her
head
when
phronsie
saw
that
polly
could
really
move
she
stopped
screaming
and
davie
began
to
smile
i
guess
she
ain
t
no
indeed
said
polly
finding
it
easier
to
control
herself
since
she
had
begun
and
hopping
to
her
feet
i
m
going
back
to
my
baking
she
cried
so
do
cried
mother
pepper
approvingly
with
a
little
smile
over
at
polly
that
ran
right
down
into
the
sad
little
heart
may
i
bake
cried
phronsie
the
last
tear
rolling
off
by
itself
in
a
lonely
fashion
may
i
polly
may
i
and
she
scrambled
down
from
her
mother
s
lap
and
ran
over
to
the
table
yes
indeed
cried
polly
delighted
at
the
change
in
affairs
then
i
shall
said
davie
at
least
when
joel
gets
out
may
i
call
him
mamsie
he
begged
no
said
pepper
picking
up
the
stocking
again
and
attacking
the
biggest
hole
joel
must
wait
till
he
knows
he
s
then
i
don
t
want
to
bake
yet
said
david
with
a
sigh
polly
flew
around
at
her
preparations
for
baking
making
a
great
clatter
with
the
things
and
keeping
up
a
cheery
little
chat
with
phronsie
but
all
the
while
her
heart
was
sore
over
joel
sitting
lonely
and
disconsolate
in
the
old
provision
room
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
bear
it
another
minute
longer
when
suddenly
she
heard
the
door
open
slowly
and
his
feet
coming
over
the
rickety
steps
pepper
mended
steadily
on
and
did
not
turn
her
head
polly
held
her
breath
as
joel
without
a
glance
for
any
one
else
marched
straight
past
the
and
over
to
mamsie
s
side
i
m
sorry
i
was
bad
mamsie
he
began
but
he
never
got
any
further
for
mother
pepper
had
him
in
her
arms
and
there
he
was
cuddled
to
his
heart
s
content
and
polly
deserted
the
leaving
phronsie
to
work
her
own
sweet
will
among
the
materials
while
she
rushed
over
and
dropped
a
kiss
on
joel
s
stubby
head
telling
him
it
was
she
who
was
so
naughty
and
she
never
was
going
to
do
it
again
and
little
david
clasped
his
hands
and
beamed
at
them
all
in
great
satisfaction
now
you
had
better
see
what
phronsie
is
about
advised
pepper
wisely
i
don
t
care
cried
polly
in
a
glad
recklessness
and
plunging
over
to
the
with
both
boys
at
her
heels
oh
my
goodness
me
what
have
you
been
doing
phronsie
baking
a
cake
hummed
phronsie
in
a
state
of
bliss
she
had
upset
the
in
trying
to
pull
it
toward
her
and
what
didn
t
fly
over
the
floor
was
on
her
face
and
pinafore
while
she
patted
the
yeast
in
the
cracked
cup
with
her
spoon
hoh
hoh
how
you
look
laughed
joel
and
david
just
like
the
old
with
that
brown
flour
all
over
your
but
phronsie
didn
t
care
so
while
polly
shook
off
the
flour
and
cleaned
things
up
taking
great
care
to
get
the
the
length
of
the
table
away
from
the
little
fingers
she
was
singing
all
the
time
i
m
going
to
bake
a
cake
polly
said
at
last
the
bread
was
made
and
covered
with
an
old
towel
was
set
down
to
rise
by
the
stove
phronsie
s
cake
was
set
in
her
own
little
tin
and
tucked
into
the
oven
and
then
the
three
children
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
it
was
still
dark
the
rain
going
patter
patter
patter
worse
than
ever
on
the
roof
mamsie
do
you
mind
if
i
tell
them
a
story
asked
polly
looking
at
them
all
no

cried
pepper
cheerily

thing
polly
i
m
glad

of
it
i
sh
d
like
to

would

mamsie
cried
polly
quite
delighted
yes
indeed
seems
as
if
my
needle
would
go
in
and
out
faster
if
i
could
hear
something
meanwhile
replied
mother
pepper
so
polly
feeling
quite
important
at
being
about
to
tell
a
story
that
mother
pepper
was
to
listen
to
gathered
the
three
children
in
a
knot
about
her
on
the
floor
ready
to
begin
i
wish
ben

here
began
joel
it
s
good
ben
has
wood
to
saw
at
blodgett
s
spoke
up
pepper
quickly
he
s
in
that
nice
tight
woodshed
so
the
rain
won
t
hurt
him
and
just
think
children
of
the
money
he
ll
bring
polly
couldn
t
help
but
give
a
little
sigh
how
perfectly
lovely
it
would
be
if
she
weren
t
a
girl
but
could
go
off
and
earn
money
just
like
ben
to
keep
the
little
brown
house
going
but
mother
pepper
didn
t
hear
the
sigh
it
was
such
a
tiny
one
as
polly
saw
by
glancing
over
at
her
and
so
away
flew
the
as
fast
as
she
could
on
her
entertainment
now
children
began
polly
hoping
mamsie
would
like
the
story
and
racking
her
brains
to
make
it
up
as
she
went
along
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
an
old
hoh
hoh
jeered
joel
knocking
his

together
that

david
looking
over
at
the
pepper
humming
away
on
the
stove

pepper
if

used
to
go
out
every
single
day
and
pick
up
pieces
of
branches
of
trees
to
burn
you
see
she
didn
t
have
any
children
to
go
for
her
and
the
cat
stayed
home
to
mind
the
house
and
there
was
nobody
to
talk
to
but
the
old
oh
dear
me
said
david
now
the
old
was
cross
sometimes
said
polly
she
was
so
very
how
old
interrupted
joel
oh
i
don
t
know
fifty
years
i
guess
said
polly
at
a
venture
and
she
was
black
all
over
oh
as
black
as
she
could
be
blacker
n
anything
i
see
round
here
said
polly
glancing
at
the
rusty
little
shoes
stuck
out
before
her
well
and
she
was
tired
too
besides
being
black
because
you
see
she
had
sung
and
hummed
and
buzzed
every
single
day
for
all
that
long
time
just
in
that
one
spot
oh
she
was
so
tired
she
just
wanted
to
roll
down
on
the
floor
and
off
and
away
to
see
the
world
and
one
morning
the
old
woman
put
on
her
big
black
cap
over
her
white
one
and
took
down
her
thick
stick
with
a
knob
on
the
end
of
it
mind
the
house
now
she
said
to
the
cat
who
sat
by
the
fire
and
off
she
went
to
the
wood
to
get
her
branches
and
sticks
illustration
mind
the
house
now
she
said
to
the
cat
suddenly
there
was
a
big
noise
just
like
this
and
polly
gave
a
hiss
as
near
like
a
as
she
could
manage
and
then
a
voice
said
oh
that
s
you
said
the
cat
without
turning
her
head
who
else
would
it
be
but
me
said
the
old
sharply
when
there
s
not
a
soul
comes
in
here
day
after
day
come
you
cross
thing
why
don
t
you
talk
for
the
cat
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
sleep
that
very
minute
i
haven
t
anything
to
talk
about
said
the
cat
sleepily
well
i
have
snapped
the
puff
puff
and
i
m
very
angry
indeed
and
i
m
tired
of
staying
in
this
old
place
day
after
day
and
i
tell
you
what
i
m
going
to
do
i
m
going
to
jump
right
down
and
go
off
to
see
the
world
yes
i
you
can
t
said
the
cat
still
not
turning
her
head
for
you
haven
t
any
as
if
that
was
any
matter
snorted
the
old
then
she
raised
her
lid
and
sent
out
angry
little
whiffs
of
steam
so
that
the
cat
moved
uneasily
i
don
t
have
to
depend
on
legs
like
you
great
lazy
things
i
can
roll
just
as
with
that
she
gave
a
great
lunge
and
over
she
went
on
her
fat
side
and
off
with
a
bang
to
the
floor
the
cat
not
knowing
which
way
she
might
come
wisely
sprang
for
the
old
table
and
peered
at
her
over
the
side
like
this
said
polly
hanging
over
an
imaginary
the
children
screamed
with
delight
and
mamsie
set
a
whole
row
of
stitches
briskly
into
place
while
she
smiled
contentedly
over
her
needle
oh
you
bad
naughty
thing
cried
the
cat
phif
spit
meow
to
do
such
things
and
run
away
while
the
mistress
is
i
can
t
help
it
said
the
old
rolling
busily
on
toward
the
door
while
a
pool
of
hot
water
trailed
off
into
little
streams
on
the
floor
i
m
tired
to
death
sitting
in
a
hump
on
that
old
stove
day
in
and
day
out
you
can
go
out
and
see
the
world
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
to
i
have
to
mind
the
house
said
the
cat
sitting
up
stiffly
on
the
table
her
tail
lashed
around
her
body
and
her
green
eyes
staring
at
the
old
nonsense
the
had
got
through
puffing
because
you
see
there
wasn
t
any
steam
left
in
her
and
now
she
began
to
roll
along
more
slowly
at
last
she
knocked
up
against
the
door
with
a
bump
you
can
t
get
out
exclaimed
the
cat
anyway
for
you
don
t
know
how
to
open
the
and
she
laughed
softly
under
her
whiskers
to
herself
sitting
there
on
the
table
the
old
lifted
its
long
nose
angrily
in
the
air
jump
down
this
minute
she
cried
and
open
it
for
me
come
i
m
in
a
hurry
for
i
m
going
to
see
the
i
sha
n
t
open
the
door
declared
the
cat
with
great
composure
said
polly
feeling
very
glad
she
had
slipped
over
the
big
word
so
well
so
there
and
she
lashed
her
tail
stiffer
than
ever
around
her
legs
the
old
cried
and
whimpered
and
begged
but
it
was
no
use
the
cat
sat
up
like
a
wooden
cat
and
just
stared
at
her
at
last
the
rolled
over
on
her
side
and
laid
her
long
nose
on
the
floor
i
m
afraid
she
s
dead
said
the
cat
to
herself
and
and
was
she
dead
asked
little
davie
was
she
polly
you
ll
see
she
cried
pretty
soon
well
so
the
cat
was
so
awfully
afraid
the
poor
old
was
dead
that
she
stepped
down
from
the
table
and
went
and
bent
over
and
looked
at
her
and
no
sooner
had
she
touched
her
with
her
paw
to
feel
and
be
sure
about
it
than
the
old
hopped
up
as
quick
as
a
wink
and
the
cat
flew
back
and
then
she
had
to
run
oh
so
dreadfully
fast
because
the
began
to
roll
at
her
and
round
and
round
the
room
they
went
and
the
kept
always
between
the
table
and
the
cat
so
she
couldn
t
jump
on
that
and
she
couldn
t
hop
on
the
stove
because
it
was
hot
so
she
had
to
open
the
door
and
before
she
could
shut
it
there
was
the
close
behind
her
and
did
she
get
away
cried
joel
clear
off
to
see
the
world
yes
said
polly
and
she
never
came
back
she
screamed
out
as
she
rolled
down
the
long
hill
before
the
cottage
door
by
oh

said
both
boys
and
by
cat
sang
phronsie
and
did

ever

joel
looking
up
and
nearly
upsetting
david
as
he
jumped
clear
past
him

little
bunch
of
peppers
together
in
the
as
the
edge
of
the
twilight
was
called
when
it
was
too
soon
to
light
a
candle
because
mother
pepper
couldn
t
afford
any
light
in
the
old
kitchen
except
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
then
she
began
yes
they
all
lived
together
in
the
big
where

cried
joel
insistently
at
which
the
others
clamored

window
of
the
little
shop
just
like

green

joel
and
a
big
knocker
that

clang
clang
like

and
he
jumped

imaginary
brass
knocker

green
door

joel

sharp
black

her
closely

said
joel
bringing
down
his

to
her
lap
you
said
they
were
in
the
big
polly
smacking
his
lips
yes
oh
and
it
stood
on
the
shelf
that
ran
along
inside
the
window
and
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
man
who
kept
the
shop
and
he
had
a
little
bit
of
a
wife
who
helped
him
and
why

minute
i
can
t

i

little
davie
patiently
and
drawing
a
long
sigh
yes

joel
said
polly
and
it
keeps

me
so
i
want
the
pink
and
white
sticks
said
phronsie
stretching
out
her
feet
please
hurry
so
joel
clapped
one
hand
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
interrupting
polly
again
and
she
began
once
more
yes
old
periwinkle
and
periwinkle
were
little
and
dried
up
just
like
two
little
withered
nuts
and
they
had
ever
so
many
little
periwinkleses
and
so
they
had
to
work
very
hard
to
keep
shoes
and
stockings
on
their
feet
and
to
get
them
enough
to
eat
so
periwinkle
used
to
make
candy
and
doughnuts
and
oo
exploded
joel
forgetting
himself
then
he
clapped
the
other
hand
too
upon
his
mouth
and
then
periwinkle
would
run
out
into
the
shop
and
say
to
periwinkle
here
s
another
batch
of
candy
my
dear
or
look
what
i
ve
brought
you
sliding
a
pan
of
doughnuts
on
the
counter
just
in
time
for
the
folks
opening
the
green
door
and
coming
into
the
shop
to
buy
things
well
one
day
a
perfectly
dreadful
thing
happened
polly
drew
a
long
breath
and
gazed
at
her
audience
what
was
it
cried
little
davie
breathlessly
phronsie
sat
quite
still
with
clasped
hands
and
wide
eyes
fixed
on
polly
s
face
joel
was
cramming
his
fists
up
against
his
mouth
in
great
distress
why
the
pink
and
white
candy
sticks
were
gone
and
there
was
the
big
jar
all
tumbled
down
on
its
side
said
polly
with
a
very
impressive
air
just
think
of
that
children
oh
dear
exclaimed
the
two
little
peppers
while
joel
nodded
his
stubbly
black
head
yes
they
were
said
polly
still
more
impressively
every
single
one
of
all
those
pink
and
white
how
many
were
there
ugh
cried
joel
forgetting
himself
then
he
clapped
his
hands
up
to
his
mouth
again
oh
i
don
t
know
yes
there
were
six
no
i
guess
eleven
of
those
pink
and
white
sticks
said
polly
thoughtfully
six
white
ones
and
five
pink
i
d
rather
have
had
six
pink
ones
said
little
davie
reflectively
well
i
ll
change
them
said
polly
accommodatingly
and
let
the
white
ones
be
five
yes
that
s
best
after
all
there
were
six
pink
ones
children
well
and
so
i
d
rather
have
the
white
ones
be
six
cried
joel
in
a
roar
and
dropping
his
fists
they
re
best
any
way
beebe
s
white
ones
were
bigger
n
the
pink
ones
and
lots
sweeter
let
the
white
ones
be
six
polly
do
thereupon
an
animated
discussion
began
as
to
which
should
be
six
and
which
should
be
five
between
the
two
boys
little
david
taking
an
unusually
firm
stand
as
he
insisted
on
the
pink
ones
so
at
last
polly
broke
in
i
ll
tell
you
children
what
we
will
do
there
shall
be
twelve
sticks
six
pink
and
six
white
ones
now
that
s
yes
that
s
fine
cried
joel
and
david
together
well
go
on
now
where
do
you
suppose
those
pink
and
white
sticks
could
have
gone
to
cried
polly
clasping
her
hands
mr
periwinkle
and
periwinkle
hadn
t
sold
them
what
have
become
of
them
the
little
peppers
shook
their
heads
and
the
little
periwinkleses
hadn
t
touched
them
oh
no
indeed
declared
polly
in
a
tone
of
horror
so
what
could
really
have
become
of
them
what
it
was
phronsie
who
asked
this
and
she
crept
into
polly
s
lap
and
put
her
little
hand
up
on
polly
s
neck
illustration
she
crept
into
polly
s
lap
and
put
her
little
hand
up
on
her
neck
well
nobody
knew
said
polly
stopping
only
long
enough
to
give
phronsie
a
hug
and
ever
so
many
kisses
and
then
what
do
you
think
children
they
found
had
happened
to
the
pink
and
white
sticks
at
this
there
was
great
excitement
the
children
protesting
they
couldn
t
guess
and
wouldn
t
polly
hurry
and
tell
them
so
she
dashed
along
well
periwinkle
said
he
was
going
to
sit
up
that
night
and
watch
and
periwinkle
said
she
was
going
to
and
all
the
little
periwinkleses
said
they
were
going
to
do
the
same
thing
so
nobody
went
to
bed
at
oh
dear
me
said
david
didn
t
the
littlest
little
peri
what
is
it
polly
asked
phronsie
in
a
troubled
way
periwinkleses
said
polly
yes
didn
t
the
very
littlest
get
into
the
asked
phronsie
no
not
even
the
littlest
of
the
periwinkleses
said
polly
she
was
the
baby
and
she
sat
up
in
periwinkle
s
oh
said
phronsie
well
along
about
ten
o
clock
no
i
guess
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
night
said
polly
all
the
periwinkleses
were
keeping
just
as
still
as
could
be
you
know
and
there
they
sat
on
their
chairs
and
crickets
with
their
eyes
wide
open
staring
at
that
big
jar
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
periwinkle
and
periwinkle
had
put
some
more
pink
and
white
sticks
in
it
so
as
to
see
what
would
happen
to
them
and
were
there
six
pink
and
six
white
ones
screamed
joel
before
the
others
could
say
a
word
yes
i
guess
there
were
just
exactly
so
many
said
polly
and
there
they
stood
up
as
tall
and
splendid
in
the
oo
joel
smacked
his
lips
well
along
in
the
middle
of
the
night
nobody
stirred
but
all
the
eyes
were
staring
at
those
pink
and
white
sticks
when
suddenly
there
was
a
little
wee
faint
phronsie
snuggled
up
closer
to
polly
it
came
from
under
the
counter
and
pretty
soon
they
all
heard
a
faint
voice
say
is
it
time
to
come
out
and
do
it
yes
said
another
voice
the
clock
has
just
struck
twelve
and
all
the
big
periwinkles
and
the
little
periwinkleses
are
but
they
ain
t
polly
broke
in
phronsie
suddenly
sitting
straight
in
polly
s
lap
i
know
pet
but
these
little
things
with
the
voices
under
the
counter
thought

and
tumbled
down
inside
among

in
peace
to
get

tired
and
hungry
before
long
but
at

and
the
children
tired
of

began
to
tease
polly
for
the
story
she
had
promised

joel
drove
tisbett

big
into

joel
stood
perfectly
still
and
did
not
speak
a
word
for
several
minutes
quite
overcome
at
this
so
polly
seized
the
opportunity
to
rush
along
as
fast
as
she
could
in
the
story
well
and
there
was
a
funny
old
man
who
drove
the
he
wasn

in
the
least
like
our
tisbett
he
was
little
and

her

world
like
our
nice
good
he

david
with
a
lively
remembrance
of
his

polly
so
you
see
people
didn
t
say
much
to
him
but
they
just
paid
down
their
money
into
his
hands
and
hopped
in
as
soon
as
ever
they
how

joel
abruptly
and

joel
kicking
out
behind

then
going
through
as
wonderful
evolutions
as
he
thought
his
steeds
could
accomplish
if
he
held
the
reins
yes

as
full
as
it

said
little
david
hugging
himself
in
great
satisfaction
there
was
a
fat
old
woman
who
took
up
most
of
one
whole
seat
and
she
had
a
parrot
in
a
big
cage
tied
over
with
a
newspaper
all
except
a
hole
at
the
top
so
she
could
breathe
and
the
old
woman
kept
leaning
over
and
peeping
into
this
hole
and
asking

then
besides

of
seeds

said
polly
absently
well
so

phronsie
in
a
grieved
little
voice
that

polly
at
sight
of
her
face
yes

corner
of
the
felt
in
his
pocket
and
he
found
one

phronsie
in
great
relief
well

me
see
where

polly
wrinkling
her
brows
oh

in
the
other
side
of
the
sitting
with
their
backs
to
the
horses
two
of
them
were
black
and
two

white
said
joel
yes
polly
hurried
on
to
get
him
off
from
the
horses
well
there
were
three
boys
crowded
into
the
seat
and
they
had
a
basket

she
set
her
teeth
together
hard
how

she
could
make
a
if
she
ever
had
the
chance
why
couldn
t
the
little
brown
house
ever
have
anything
and
for
a
moment
she
drooped
her
shoulders
in
a
sorry
little
fashion
and
all
the
brightness
went
out
of
her
round
face
we
never
have
anything
said
little
davie
plaintively
never
said
phronsie
sadly
shaking
her
yellow
head
and
there
they

two
sorry
little
figures

the
matter
was
with
the
everybody

but
the
big
black
now
i
know
that
he
is
going
to
eat
up
the
boys
grandmother
s
cried
joel
oh

till

to
em
joe
cried
polly
who
dearly
loved
to
announce
all
the
startling
surprises
in
her
stories
with
as
much
of
a
flourish
as
possible
well
i
most
know
he
is
said
joel
subsiding
into
a
loud
whisper
ain
t
he
polly
maybe
well
now
you
know
everybody
was
peering
and
looking
this
way
and
that
all
over
the
big
i
don
t
see
anything
broken
said
the
little
thin
man
getting
down
on
his
knees
on
the
hard
frozen
ground
to
examine
it
underneath
and
neither
do
i
said
the
big
fat
woman
very
angrily
and
i
m
just
going
to
get
in
no
you
won
t
either
ma
am
declared
the
cross
little
for
this
is
my
and
i
tell
you
i
heard
something
twas
a
piece
of
a
stone
in
the
road
i
guess
said
the
thin
little
man
getting
up
from
his
knees
and
brushing
the
dirt
off
or
a
stick
you
ran
over
most
likely
said
another
but
the
little
old
said
no
very
crossly
it
wasn
t
either
of
these
it
sounded
just
like
the
bottom
of
his
cracking
and
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
it
smashed
and
he
kept
them
all
out
there
in
the
cold
till
he
looked
over
and
under
and
around
it
very
carefully
at
last
as
he
couldn
t
find
anything
not
even
the
smallest
tiniest
bit
of
a
crack
he
let
them
get
in
again
so
the
big
fat
woman
picked
up
her
parrot
in
the
cage
with
the
newspaper
tied
over
it
all
except
a
hole
in
the
top
for
it
to
breathe
through
and
everybody
else
got
their
things
and
clambered
in
all
but
the
three
boys
who
couldn
t
find
the
they
were
carrying
to
their
grandmother
that
was
under
the
bush
by
the
oh
dear
me
they
all
exclaimed
while
phronsie
clasped
her
small
hands
in
despair
and
sat
quite
still
no
it
wasn
t
there
declared
polly
shaking
her
brown
head
not
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
the
crust
nor
a
bit
of
the
dish
nor
a
single
speck
of
the
basket
and
oh
how
those
boys
did
feel
what
did
they
do
cried
joel
feeling
such
a
calamity
not
to
be
borne
they
just
couldn
t
do
anything
said
polly
and
down
they
sat
on
three
stones
by
the
roadside
and
everybody
had
stopped
getting
in
and
turned
to
help
look
for
the
pie
and
pretty
soon
they
all
heard
a
dreadful
what
was
it
asked
phronsie
fearfully
oh
now
i
know
it
is
the
coming
back
and
those
three
boys
can
take
it
to
their
grandmother
exclaimed
little
david
joyfully
hoh
hoh
a
can
t
come
back
like
that
said
joel
with
a
snort
and
the
little
thin
man
came
skurrying
out
of
the
bushes
and
dragging
after
him
his
big
black
dog
said
polly
with
a
fine
flourish
who
smelt
of
all
over
his
face
and
he
wouldn
t
look
at
anybody
and
especially
the
three
boys
sitting
on
their
stones
by
the
roadside
but
he
rolled
his
eyes
up
like
this
polly
looked
off
sideways
and
up
at
an
imaginary
sky
and
his
master
the
thin
little
man
said
and
he
dragged
him
by
his
collar
up
in
front
of
those
boys
now

you
re
sorry
you
ve
eaten
up
all
that
pie
and

bark
bark
just
as

phronsie
screamed
in
great
excitement
and
clapped
her
hands
together
to
think
of
the
big
dog
then
she
grew
very
sober
but
what
will
the
boys
do
polly
and
the
grandmother
finished
joel
and
david
together
oh
the
little
thin
man
said

he
dropped

two
three

joel
excitedly

polly
nodding
away

two
dozen
all
richer
and
juicier
and
better
than
the
one
the
boys
were
carrying
to
their

vexed
tone
and
looking

corner
then
she
remembered
what
mamsie

the
buttery

moment
to

joel
knocking

of

polly
sat
down
on
the
floor
feeling
still
very
queer
to
be
telling
stories
in
the
daytime
without
a
needle
in
her
fingers
and
joel
squirmed
along
and
laid
his

on
the
flat
leaning
both

on
a
knobby
old
stick
and
his
head
underneath
his
torn
hat
was
bobbing
as
he
trembled
with
age
the

she
began
in
a
faltering
voice

and
crowding
past
her
to

of
their

said
with
a

sigh
and
resting
his
head
on
his
shaking
hands
joel
said
polly
drawing

great
difficulty

time
joe
if

where

re
i
caught
my
toe
in

rug
said
joe
racing
over
to
the
table
i
was
looking
at
the
pan
and
i
didn
t
see
where
i
was
well
you
must
use
your
eyes
so
you
do
see
where

said
polly
with
a
merry
laugh
there
now
and
she
put
the
second
pan
in
joel
s
happy
hands
this
one
will
go
all
right
i
and
this
one
did
and
it
was
presently
shut
up
tight
in
the
hot
oven
along
with
the
lonely
little
now
puffing
up
finely
and
joel
proud
as
he
could
be
strutted
up
and
down
the
kitchen
floor
and
polly
put
away
her
and
soon
the
old
kitchen
was
it
was
so
fresh
and
tidy
and
now
she
said
we
can
t
do
anything
for
that
poor
old
man
till
those
biscuits
are
done
oh
dear
me
how
perfectly
splendid
here
comes
mamsie
and
out
through
the
old
doorway
and
over
the
flat
stone
raced
polly
with
joel
at
her
heels
and
they
seized
mother
pepper
on
both
sides
holding
her
arms
while
joel
took
her
big
bundle
all
the
time
pouring
the
story
of
the
poor
old
man
and
the
dreadful
state
he
was
in
and
the
biscuits
baking
and
oh
joel
must
confess
how
he
had
upset
the
pan
with
the
first
ones
though
polly
tried
to
stop
him
and
oh
couldn
t
mamsie
fry
him
some
potatoes
right
away
and
ever
so
much
more
till
they
all
three
stood
in
the
old
kitchen
he
must
have
some
tea
said
pepper
with
a
sharp
look
at
him
and
throwing
off
her
shawl
run
polly
and
get
the
o
mammy
exclaimed
polly
mother
pepper
never
had
tea
unless
she
had
caught
cold
or
was
so
tired
she
must
take
it
or
get
sick
and
there
was
now
such
a
very
little
bit
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
caddy
and
polly
stood
quite
still
run
i
say
polly
commanded
pepper
and
she
pulled
the
old
into
a
hotter
part
of
the
stove
a
fine
cup
of
tea
will
do
his
bones
good
more
n
anything
there
s
such
a
little
bit
left
gasped
polly
not
moving
polly
pepper
turned
suddenly
on
her
why
polly
hush
he
ll
hear
you
for
shame
child
he
s
such
a
very
poor
old
and
then
you
won
t
have
any
said
polly
at
her
end
of
o
mamsie
i
wish
i
hadn
t
brought
him
in
she
added
under
her
breath
and
she
burst
into
tears
pepper
only
stopped
to
pat
her
head
and
then
she
hurried
into
the
pantry
and
brought
out
the
and
polly
with
the
tears
racing
over
her
face
watched
her
as
the
precious
tea
was
poured
into
the
little
black
pot
and
set
on
the
stove
now
run
polly
child
cried
mother
pepper
as
cheerily
as
ever
and
get
the
big
cup
on
the
upper
this
used
to
be
father
pepper
s
and
was
carefully
laid
away
so
while
polly
ran
off
with
her
tears
wiping
them
on
her
apron
pepper
sliced
up
some
cold
potatoes
and
set
them
in
the
spider
to
fry
joel
in
the
meantime
had
been
opening
his
mother
s
big
bundle
as
he
always
tried
to
do
whenever
she
brought
home
the
fresh
supply
of
sacks
and
coats
to
make
so
he
heard
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
and
i
guess
you
better
have
a
look
at
those
biscuits
in
the
oven
observed
pepper
wisely
as
she
sliced
away
so
polly
ran
and
kneeled
down
before
the
stove
and
drew
out
first
one
pan
and
then
the
other
the
one
with
the
lonely
little
lumps
in
it
o
mamsie
she
exclaimed
happily
see
they
re
as
fine
as
they
can
be
and
sure
enough
they
were
every
biscuit
had
turned
a
lovely
brown
and
it
had
puffed
up
in
just
the
right
place
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
we
did
our
so
they
are
cried
pepper
pleased
to
see
polly
all
right
once
more
it
beats
all
polly
to
see
how
nicely
you
can
bake
things
mother
s
proud
of
polly
set
down
the
two
hot
pans
on
the
kitchen
table
and
ran
round
back
of
her
mother
and
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
black
hair
i
m
awfully
sorry
she
whispered
i
know
it
said
pepper
and
now
we
just
won
t
say
any
more
about
it
polly
then
she
briskly
began
to
turn
her
that
were
sizzling
away
in
the
spider
in
the
cheeriest
fashion
and
polly
got
a
little
old
towel
very
clean
and
nice
and
spread
it
on
the
tray
and
she
put
the
big
cup
upon
it
and
mamsie
poured
the
tea
into
it
and
dished
out
some
crisp
on
a
plate
and
polly
put
some
little
biscuits
around
it
all
and
there
was
a
dinner
fit
for
a
king
oh
my
howled
joel
smelling
the
potatoes
what
have
you
got
jumping
up
and
nearly
upsetting
polly
and
tray
and
all
as
she
carried
it
slowly
across
the
kitchen
to
the
old
man
s
chair
take
care
joe
warned
pepper
following
to
help
polly
oh
oh
joel
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
everything
but
father
pepper
s
cup
and
he
pointed
an
astonished
finger
at
it
i
know
it
said
pepper
setting
her
lips
together
firmly
father
d
like
to
have
us
let
the
old
man
take
it
now
polly
you
can
feed
him
the
potato
and

said
joel
crowding
in
between
and
trying
to
get
possession
of
the
fork
no
i
think
polly
better
but
you
can
break
the
biscuits
apart
said
pepper
so
pretty
soon
the
old
man
was
sitting
up
quite
straight
for
him
and
after
he
had
taken
one
or
two
good
draughts
of
the
steaming
tea
he
felt
quite
revived
and
let
polly
feed
him
the
crisp
and
the
biscuits
which
joel
industriously
broke
apart
until
pepper
put
down
the
empty
cup
and
regarded
polly
s
plate
on
which
there
wasn
t
a
scrap
of
anything
left
but
the
fork
i
can
t
thank
you
said
the
old
man
quite
heartened
up
and
looking
around
at
them
all
no
don
t
try
said
pepper
you
can
go
to
sleep
now
come
children
and
she
drew
them
off
into
the
bedroom
now
polly
she
said
when
the
door
was
shut
you
must
run
down
to
parson
henderson
s
at
once
he
ll
know
what
to
do
with
the
poor
old
man
for
we
can
t
let
him
go
he
ll
tumble
down
in
the
i
will
mother
cried
polly
tying
on
her
what

i
say
mammy
say
why

just
what
it
all
is
how
he
came
and
ask
parson
henderson

and
don
t
let
the
grass

under
your
will
parson
henderson

what
to
do
with
him
cried
joel
in
a
loud
whisper
yes
of
course
said
polly
quickly
parson
henderson
knows
everything
but
spose
he
shouldn
t
be
home
and
i
sh
d
see
miss
jerusha
and
polly
s
round
cheek
turned
pale
with
fright
go
along
child
and
don
t
worry
about
things
till
you
get
to
em
said
pepper
the
lord
ll
provide
and
i
believe
he
ll
let
parson
henderson
be
so
polly
ran
off
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
presently
back
she
came
in
state
riding
in
the
big
old
chaise
that
parson
henderson
had
borrowed
from
one
of
his
parishioners
and
on
the
way
the
minister
told
so
many
pleasant
things
that
polly
wished
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
mamsie
s
anxiety
over
the
old
man
that
that
ride
might
last
forever
and
then
they
were
in
front
of
the
little
brown
house
to
which
they
drove
up
with
a
flourish
bringing
joel
out
with
an
envious
whoop
and
pepper
to
the
window
and
then
parson
henderson
and
pepper
and
the
children
helped
the
poor
old
man
tenderly
into
the
big
chaise
to
go
to
the
nice
place
that
the
parson
knew
about
till
he
would
be
well
enough
to
go
on
his
journey
and
then
home
came
phronsie
and
david
from
grandma
bascom
s
down
the
lane
just
in
time
to
see
the
chaise
go
whirling
off
and
ben
hungry
as
a
beaver
came
rushing
in
from
his
work
for
dinner
so
mother
pepper
and
polly
had
to
fly
to
get
the
midday
meal
ready
leaving
it
to
joel
to
tell
the
story
in
his
own
way
an
opportunity
that
he
improved
to
the
utmost
and
after
dinner
ben
said
that
he
wanted
joel
to
go
back
with
him
to
work
for
there
was
wood
to
pile
and
that
meant
ten
cents
more
pay
at
night
so
it
was
evening
before
joel
thought
of
the
interrupted
story
and
he
screamed
right
out
o
polly
pepper
you
didn
t
finish
about
nutcracker
no
said
polly
i
didn
t
and
how
could

declared
joel
in
a
very
injured
fashion
why
joel
pepper
look
at
that
clock
cried
polly
pointing
to
it
it
s
only
half
a
little
after
seven
said
joel
looking
every
way
but
at
the
clock
o
joe

s
minutes
to
eight
said
davie
running
up
to
stand
under
the
clock
well
that
isn
t
much
grumbled
joel
it
s
five
minutes
after
your
joel
said
mother
pepper
going
into
the
bedroom
for
her
big
so
take
yourself
and
i
ll
finish
nutcracker
joe
promised
polly
as
joel
clattered
xiii
nutcracker
and
so
it
came
about
that
polly
began
on
the
morrow
without
any
more
ado
the
story
of
nutcracker
for
mother
pepper
said
that
she
might
sit
down
as
soon
as
the
dishes
were
washed
and
tell
it
to
joel
so
this
is
it
mr
nutcracker
began
polly
in
her
gayest
fashion
was
very
high
up
in
the
world
in
fact
he
didn
t
like
to
have
anybody
above
him
so
he
built
his
house
clear
up
ever
so
far
above
everybody
else
then
he
was
quite
what
kind
of
a
house
broke
in
joel
never
mind
you
wait
till
you
hear
more
of
the
story
said
polly
well
nutcracker
liked
her
house
that
he
built
her
very
much
indeed
that
is
she
would
have
liked
it
but
the
children
the
little
nutcrackers
you
see
wouldn
t
stay
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
joel
no
they
kept
jumping
out
as
fast
as
they
could
and
those
that
didn
t
jump
out
tumbled
oh
dear
me
said
joel
again
until
it
was
very
dreadful
declared
polly
shaking
her
brown
head
for
it
kept
poor
nutcracker
running
every
minute
to
the
door
of
her
house
to
try
to
keep
her
children
in
at
last
she
said
to
her
husband
nutcracker
pa
you
surely
must
build
me
a
house
nearer
to
the
and
did
he
cried
joel
absorbed
in
interest
no
he
said
oh
never
no
nutcracker
has
ever
lived
lower
down
in
the
world
than
we
are
and
i
can
t
do
it
my
dear
that
was
bad
of
him
exploded
joel
with
very
red
cheeks
bad
mean
old
man
not
to
do
as
nutcracker
wanted
him
to
do
wasn
t
he
polly
well
you
ll
see
said
polly
hurrying
along
as
fast
as
she
could
and
the
little
nutcrackerses
kept
jumping
and
tumbling
out
of
the
house
at
a
great
rate
until
one
day
something
very
dreadful
tell
about
it
cried
joel
hugely
pleased
yes
i
m
going
to
well
pa
nutcracker
had
gone
off
about
his
business
and
nutcracker
was
doing
the
work
when
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
noise
down
on
the
ground
and
two
or
three
of
the
little
nutcrackerses
jumped
out
to
the
door
and
leaned
over
and
said
they
were
going
down
to
see
what
it
was
and
then
away
they
rushed
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
and
six
of
them
brothers
and
sisters
said
they
were
going
and
they
were
in
such
a
hurry
they
didn
t
look
straight
before
them
and
they
tumbled
through
the
air
whiz
whiz
did
they
come
on
their
heads
cried
joel
excitedly
no
they
stuck
their
feet
out
and
they
came
right
down
on
them
said
polly
just
as
good
as
could
be
so
you
see
they
weren
t
hurt
a
bit
well
and
then
as
nutcracker
was
all
alone
why
she
thought
she
might
as
well
go
too
so
she
went
down
and
there
was
the
nutcracker
house
left
all
by
itself
then
came
the
dreadful
what
was
it
asked
joel
fearfully
and
snuggling
closer
to
polly
well
at
first
it
was
just
as
still
said
polly
dropping
her
voice
to
a
little
whisper
you
can
t
think
how
still
it
was
joey
pepper
not
a
creature
was
stirring
and
why
didn
t
she
shut
the
door
cried
joel
when
she
went
out
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
say
polly
why
there
wasn
t
any
key
said
polly
racing
along
now
you
mustn
t
stop
me
any
more
joe
else
i
never
ll
get
mr
nutcracker
wasn
t
a
nice
man

all
i
think
said
joel
in
great
disapproval
if
he
couldn
t
give
em
a
key
was
he
polly
you
ll
see
said
polly
redoubling
her
speed
well
when
nutcracker
ran
along
so
swiftly
being
in
such
a
hurry
you
see
her
great
long
train
to
her
dress
swept
out
and
is
it
a
train
of
cars
asked
joel
his
eyes
sticking
out
as
far
as
possible
o
polly
i
ve
never
seen
em
cept
in
a
no
said
polly
then
she
burst
out
laughing
how
could
a
train
of
cars
be
hanging
on
nutcracker
s
dress
joe
dear
me
that
would
be
funny
you
said
train
declared
joel
dreadfully
disappointed
i
know
but
this
is
different
it
s
something
made
like
the
rest
of
the
dress
and
it
hangs
off
when
the
one
who
s
got
the
dress
on
walks
and
she
can
swish
it
around
perfectly
splendidly
just
like
this
joel
pepper
and
polly
hopped
to
her
feet
and
began
to
parade
up
and
down
the
old
kitchen
floor
holding
an
imaginary
trailing
gown
and
then
letting
it
fall
like
a
peacock
s
tail
as
it
swept
the
ground
while
she
held
her
head
high
and
sailed
off

polly
began
to
parade
up
and
down
the
old
kitchen
floor

joel
in
disdain
joel

cried
coming
up
to

joel
loudly
in
an
injured
tone

exclaimed
polly
all

airs
and

tumbling
off
from

in
a
flash
and
she
skurried
back
to
joel

sight
of
her
long
train
sweeping
away
and
he
snapped
his
green
eyes
with
delight

laughed

perfectly
dreadful
laugh
and
he
said

she
replied
laughing
well
so
sure
enough
just
as
soon
as
nutcracker
was
fairly
off
in
hurried
this
dreadful
creature
right
in
the
doorway
of
the
nutcracker
did
he
get
on
nutcracker
s
bed
cried
joel

grumbled
joel
and
i
am
going

all
through
this
story
said
polly
coolly
so
it
won
t
be
any
use
for
you
to
ask
me
joe
well
and
there
he
was
as
quick
as
could
be
inside
that
dear
little
house
and
all
those
nutcrackers
polly
spread
her
hands
in
a
sad
little
way
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
joel
in
distress
well
now
you
know
when
nutcracker
went
down
she
didn
t
mean
to
stay
long
but
she
met
a
friend
who
was
it
asked
joel
abruptly
oh
it
was
dear
me
said
polly
bursting
into
a
little
laugh
it
was
her
cousin
and
you
said
it
was
her
friend
corrected
joel
well
and
so
it
was
said
polly
merrily
i
m
sure

cousin
is
a
very
nice
friend
i
wish

had
a
cousin
said
joel
i
ve
never
had
one
why
don
t
we
have
some
polly
some
what
asked
polly
absently
with
her
mind
on
the
story
wondering
how
she
should
end
it
some
cousins
said
joel
twitching
her
gown
why
don
t
we
ever
have
any
say
polly
oh
some
folks
don
t
have
any
said
polly
stifling
a
sigh
as
she
thought
how
very
nice
it
would
be
to
have
a
houseful
of
cousins
to
go
and
see
i
s
pose
poor
folks
don
t
have
any
said
joel
reflectively
um
maybe
said
polly
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
only
half
hearing
what
he
said
well
do
go
on
begged
joel
in
alarm
lest
he
should
never
get
the
end
of
that
story
and
jogging
her
elbow
what
next
polly
oh
polly
started
suddenly
and
rushed
on
again
yes
there
he
was
that
dreadful
creature
right
in
the
you
said
that
cried
joel
mrs
nutcracker
met
her
cousin
you
told
already
now
what
next
so
i
did
said
polly
brightly
yes
she
met
her
cousin
and
so
they
stopped
to
talk
and
to
ask
after
each
other
s
families
and
that
took
a
good
deal
of
time
you
know
and
all
this
while
there
was
that
dreadful
creature
in
nutcracker
s
little
oh
dear
me
cried
joel
yes
and
there
were
all
the
little
nutcrackerses
having
such
a
good
time
running
round
trying
to
find
out
what
the
noise
was
all
about
and
nutcracker
too
he
polly
asked
joel
suddenly
what
was
the
noise
about
oh
it
was
nothing
but
a
boy
driving
a
lot
of
pigs
to
market
and
they
wouldn
t
go
the
way
he
wanted
em
to
so
he
chased
em
and
he
switched
his
stick
over
their
backs
and
they
squealed
awfully
and
the
little
nutcrackerses
were
so
sorry
that
they
had
taken
the
trouble
to
come
down
just
for
that
so
they
said
they
d
race
up
home
again
and
see
who
would
illustration
and
the
pigs
wouldn
t
go
the
way
he
wanted
em
to
o
polly
cried
joel
in
great
excitement
and
did
they
and
find
the
dreadful
creature
with
the
green
eyes
waiting
for
em
in
their
home
did
they
polly
yes
said
polly
they
did
and
the
littlest
of
the
nutcrackerses
jim
nutcracker
he
got
home
first
and
he
rushed
in
the
doorway
screaming
out
i
ve
beaten
oh
dear
me
there
was
the
great
creature
lying
down
on
the
floor
ready
to
eat
him
up
joel
clapped
his
little
brown
hands
in
delight
make
him
bite
him
he
begged
do
oh
no
i
can
t
said
polly
he
was
such
a
little
nutcracker
you
know
well
he
tumbled
right
back
against
his
brothers
and
sisters
rushing
up
don
t
go
in
he
screamed
at
them
so
they
stopped
and
all
got
in
a
round
ring
and
thought
about
it
and
the
dreadful
creature
in
the
house
kept
oh
so
still
hoping
little
jim
nutcracker
hadn
t
seen
him
or
at
least
that
he
d
come
back
and
bring
his
brothers
and
sisters
with
him
and
pretty
soon
nutcracker
got
through
talking
with
her
cousin
and
so
she
came
hurrying
up
home
and
after
her
running
as
fast
as
could
be
because
you
see
it
was
getting
late
came
nutcracker
oh
here
come
mammy
and
pappy
screamed
all
the
children
as
glad
as
they
could
be
and
oh
make
nutcracker
fight
the
dreadful
man
with
the
green
eyes
in
his
house
cried
joel
make
him
knock
him
down
and
hit
him
and
bang
him
all
over
and
o
joey
cried
polly
yes
do
begged
joel
and
bite
him
till
he
squealed
just
like
the
pigs
will
you
polly
well
you
ll
see
said
polly
again
nodding
wisely
now
nutcracker
wasn
t
a
bit
afraid
so
he
cried
out
very
boldly
be
quiet
my
children
to
all
the
little
nutcrackerses
i
ll
take
care
of
the
bad
creature
in
our
but
nutcracker
was
awfully
scared
for
she
thought
if
she
had
only
stayed
at
home
the
dreadful
thing
couldn
t
have
got
in
so
when
father
nutcracker
started
to
go
and
fight
the
bad
wicked
creature
she
just
grasped
hold
of
his
ta
i
mean
his
train
and
did
father
nutcracker
wear
a
dress
cried
joel
in
the
greatest
astonishment
he
oh
no
laughed
polly
then
little
gurgles
kept
running
up
and
down
her
throat
while
joel
persisted
you
said
so
you
said
she
grabbed
hold
of
his
train
so
o
joey
i
didn
t
say
grabbed
corrected
polly
who
dearly
loved
to
use
nice
words
well
anyway
you
said
she
took
hold
of
it
and
he
had
a
train
just
like
nutcracker
s
so
he
must
have
worn
a
dress
cried
joel
stoutly
i
think
that
s
so
i
sh
d
think
said
polly
laughing
again
well
now
he
didn
t
wear
a
dress
and
you
mustn
t
interrupt
me
again
joe
if
you
do
i
shall
never
get
through
this
story
in
all
this
world
come
children
cried
nutcracker
and
polly
dashed
off
speedily
help
me
to
hold
your
pa
for
he
mustn
t
fight
that
dreadful
thing
in
our
so
all
the
little
nutcrackerses
ran
up
to
their
mother
and
helped
her
hold
nutcracker
fast
and
oh
i
think
that
s
too
bad
howled
joel
horribly
disappointed
now
there
won
t
be
any
fight
polly
pepper
you
wait
and
see
advised
polly
once
more
then
i
guess
you
ll
like
it
joel
so
joel
smiled
again
quite
comfortably
since
polly
said
he
d
like
it
he
was
quite
sure
he
should
and
so
on
polly
hurried
well
there
was
nutcracker
with
nutcracker
and
all
those
little
nutcrackerses
hanging
on
to
him
oh
so
tight
and
fast
so
he
couldn
t
get
away
you
see
although
he
begged
and
begged
and
then
nutcracker
spoke
up
loud
and
sharp
children
you
hold
tight
on
to
your
pa
and
don
t
you
let
him
go
while
i
run
down
and
get
the
cousins
to
come
and
help
o
polly
now
i
know
exclaimed
joel
in
great
glee
there
s
going
to
be
a
big
big
fight
i
like
it
a
great
deal
better
to
have
all
those
cousins
come
and
help
i
do
polly
so
i
thought
said
polly
bobbing
her
brown
head
well
i
must
hurry
so
nutcracker
ran
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
carry
her
down
to
the
ground
and
she
called
every
one
of
those
cousins
she
d
been
talking
to
such
a
little
while
ago
and
the
big
tears
rolled
out
from
her
eyes
and
she
couldn
t
speak
for
a
whole
minute
dear
dear
dear
cried
all
the
cousins
huddling
around
her
what
is
the
matter
cousin
nutcracker
and
then
she
finally
told
them
all
about
it
and
every
one
of
those
cousins
promised
he
d
go
up
with
nutcracker
and
help
to
drive
out
the
bad
wicked
creature
who
had
stolen
into
her
oh
that
was
nice
screamed
joe
in
a
joyful
tone
now
there
s
going
to
be
a
big
big
fight
and
he
wriggled
all
over
in
great
satisfaction
and
so
up
they
all
came
in
a
troop
i
guess
there
was
a
dozen
of
em
said
polly
oh
my
exclaimed
joel
yes
and
nutcracker
rushed
up
ahead
of
em
all
to
her
husband
pa
she
cried

the
bad
naughty
wicked
thing
from
our
and
every
single
one
of
those
cousins
said
yes

ll
help
you
cousin
so
the
little
nutcrackers
let
their
pa
go
and
they
were
very
glad
to
do
so
for
they
ached
all
over
holding
him
so
long
he
was
very
big
you
know
and
he
kicked
dreadfully
and
bit
and
scratched
whenever
he
didn
t
like
things
and
that
wasn
t
nice
in
a
man
observed
joel
i
ain
t
going
to
bite
and
scratch
when
i
m
grown

then
she
laughed

now
i
m
going

and
just
as
soon
as

in
the
doorway
do
you

in
and
scream
now
we

and
beat
him
and
pitch
him
out

joel
gripped
polly

arm
in
speechless
enjoyment
all
right
said
the
cousins
bobbing
their
heads
and
i
approve
of
your
plan
pa
said
nutcracker
very
proudly
and
the
little
nutcrackerses
hopped
and
skipped
in
joy
and
so
they
joel
s
eyes
got
very
big
but
he
didn
t
say
a
word
as
he
clung
to
polly
s
arm
and
don
t
you
think
said
polly
that
the
hateful
bad
old
thing
in
the
nutcrackers
house
didn
t
hear
them
coming
they
all
stepped
on
the
tips
of
their
toes
you
know
and
he
just
winked
and
blinked
his
green
eyes
as
he
said
to
himself
i
ll
catch
em
every
one
pretty
and
then
he
looked
up
and
there
was
nutcracker
s
nose
in
the
joel
jumped
as
if
he
were
shot
o
polly
he
screamed
and
after
him
came
all
those
cousins
and
nutcracker
she
was
slower
cause
she
was
so
big
you
know
yes
and
every
single
one
of
those
little
nutcrackerses
they
just
ran
in
between
all
the
others
and
all
together
they
jumped
and
hopped
onto
the
great
big
dreadful
creature
and
make
him
hop
at
them
and
kick
too
polly
that
big
man
with
the
green

joel
quite
gone
in
excitement
oh

very
dreadful
exclaimed
polly
holding
up
both
hands
for
about
a
minute
or
so
and
instead
of
the
great
dreadful
thing
crying
out
i
ve
got
you
he
began
to
whimper
and
beg
oh
let
me
go
let

go
and
pretty
soon
all
the
whole
bunch
of
nutcrackerses
and
their
cousins
who
had
come
to
help
just
lifted
up
that
bad
wicked
horrid
thing
with
the
green
eyes
that
had
stolen
into
their
house
and
they
pitched
him
head
over
heels
through
the
doorway
and
down
down
and
he
was
ten
feet
long
so
he
was
dreadful
slow

was
bad
you

the
nutcrackers
house
when

word
in
by
way
of
beginning
well
once
upon

the
brown
eyes
were
laughing
as
she
hurried
on
with
quite
a
flourish
you

that

the
time
when

rug
and
laughing
merrily
in

and
she
sat
straight
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
ll
begin
and
if

another
time
old

jasper
in
his
fiercest
fashion

polly
i

mood
in

telling

the
grounds
and
way
way
off
i
don
t
know
how
far
and
every
single
bit
of
it
was
full
and
running
over
with
how
many
cried
van
thoughtlessly
sh
jasper
held
up
his
hand
and
made
a
great
show
of
springing
in
van
s
direction
which
made
that
individual
duck
suddenly
behind
percy
s
back
you
see
he
had
to
have
a
great
many
pumpkins
to
take
to
market
because
there
were
such
lots
of
children
at
his
house
and
that
was
all
they
had
to
live
did
they
pumpkins
cried
percy
in
a
tone
of
disgust
they
didn
t
exactly
eat
them
said
polly
at
least
not
all
the
while
but
they
ate
the
things
their
father
bought
with
the
money
he
sold
them
for
at
the
oh
well
go
and
every
day
all
those
children
would
climb
up
to
all
the
windows
in
farmer
stebbins
s
house
and
watch
to
see
the
pumpkins
growing
bigger
and
the
first
thing
they
did
in
the
morning
was
to
run
out
and
count
them
to
see
if
anybody
had
run
off
with
any
in
the
how
many
were
there
asked
van
bobbing
up
from
his
retirement
cried
jasper
oh
i
don
t
know
about
a
million
i
suppose
said
polly
recklessly
o
polly
pepper
exclaimed
percy
in
astonishment
why
that
can
t
possibly
be
of
course
it
isn
t
said
polly
coolly
this
is
a
story
you
and
if
you
two
chaps
don
t
keep
still
you
ll
get
no
story
declared
jasper
again
here
s
dick
now
is
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
you
might
learn
manners
from
i
want
to
hear
polly
pepper
tell
the
story
said
little
dick
folding
his
hands
tightly
together
of
course
you
do
so
we
all
do
and
that
s
the
only
way
we
can
hear
it
by
keeping
quiet
well
go
on
polly
so
polly
began
again
well
the
pumpkins
grew
and
grew
first
they
were
green
you
know
and
funny
little
things
and
the
vines
quite
covered
them
and
then
they
grew
bigger
and
swelled
all
up
fat
and
round
and
ran
their
heads
through
the
green
leaves
and
the
frost
came
one
night
and
bit
the
grass
and
all
the
tender
things
everywhere
and
the
next
morning
when
all
the
stebbinses
ran
out
it
didn
t
seem
as
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
but
big
yellow
pumpkins
all
the
vines
were
just
puckered
and
shrivelled
up
but
the
pumpkins
were
just
as
proud
as
could
be
and
they
said
now
we
ve
got
the
whole
world
to
and
farmer
stebbins
went
up
and
down
among
them
all
rubbing
his
hands
just
like
this
and
polly
looked
so
like
him
that
everybody
burst
out
laughing
and
he
said
now
says
i
my
fine
pumpkins
we
ll
put
you
in
a
pile
very
soon
and
when
your
coats
get
yellow
away
you
go
to
what
did
he
mean
demanded
percy
be
still
and
she
ll
tell
you
said
jasper
and
sure
enough
what
do
you
think
every
single
one
of
those
million
pumpkins
soon
found
himself
in
a
great
big
pile
against
the
barn
and
there
they
were
to
stay
until
the
farmer
said
they
were
yellow
enough
then
away
they
would
drive
to
the
market
well
one
cold
night
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
in
the
farmhouse
and
even
snap
the
great
brindled
dog
was
asleep
and
all
was
as
still
as
it
could
be
when
one
yellow
pumpkin
up
top
of
the
very
tip
of
the
pile
whispered
and
every
other
pumpkin
listened
with
all
his
might
to
hear
what
he
was
going
to
say
we
are
all
very
foolish
said
the
tip
top
pumpkin
if
we
stay
here
to
be
carted
off
to
that
old
market
where
somebody
comes
along
to
buy
us
to
carry
us
home
to
eat
what
can
we
do
cried
all
the
others
straight
through
the
big
pile
hush
don
t
make
such
a
dreadful
noise
warned
the
tip
top
pumpkin
or
we
shall
have
the
whole
house
after
us
i
m
not
going
to
be
made
up
into
a
thanksgiving
pie
i
can
tell
at
the
word
pie
all
the
other
pumpkins
shivered
so
that
down
came
the
pile
rolling
and
clattering
to
the
ground
and
some
of
them
were
going
so
fast
they
couldn
t
stop
but
kept
right
on
and
were
never
seen
more
let
s
all
run
said
the
tip
top
pumpkin
suddenly
come
with
that
he
tumbled
himself
down
with
a
will
and
set
off
down
the
road
towards
the
village
but
the
other
pumpkins
didn
t
dare
to
follow
but
they
huddled
together
just
where
they
fell
and
so
tip
top
i
m
going
to
call
him
went
on
alone
but
he
didn
t
care
and
he
sang
to
himself
as
he
rolled
along
just
as
jolly
and
gay
and
the
first
thing
he
knew
an
awful
thing
came
thwacking
on
his
back
and
a
big
hand
said
here
stop
there
you
re
coming
with
and
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
oh
oh
screamed
the
three
boys
oh
no
i
m
not
going
with
you
gasped
poor
mr
tip
top
i
m
going
by
myself
thank
and
he
wished
a
thousand
times
he
was
back
again
on
the
snug
pile
with
the
other
pumpkins
the
great
big
giant
only
laughed
and
he
slipped
the
pumpkin
into
his
pocket
where
he
rattled
round
no
bigger
than
a
hickory
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
percy
while
van
struck
his
hands
together
in
delight
and
then
the
giant
stamped
on
the
ground
and
poor
mr
tip
top
thought
it
thundered
and
he
began
to
beg
with
all
his
might
to
be
let
out
and
in
a
minute
some
boys
three
or
four
times
as
big
as
farmer
simpson
in
size
came
running
up
what
do
you
want
master
they
cried
catch
me
a
young
elephant
roared
the
giant
at
them
a
juicy
tender
one
and
half
a
dozen
young
lions
for
sauce
and
then
run
home
and
heat
the
pot
boiling
hot
for
i
ve
got
a
juicy
pumpkin
in
my
pocket
for
a
nice
little
morsel
to
go
with
oh
how
poor
mr
tip
top
trembled
down
deep
in
that
giant
s
dreadful
pocket
it
was
as
black
as
a
well
and
however
much
he
struggled
he
knew
he
never
could
get
up
please
giant
he
said
in
a
very
weak
voice
he
was
so
afraid
do
let
me
out
you
are
so
big
i
could
only
make
you
a
mouthful
and
i
want
to
go
be
quiet
roared
the
giant
at
him
or
i
ll
chew
your
head
right
off
in
one
bite
so
poor
miserable
mr
tip
top
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
roll
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
pocket
and
shiver
and
shake
and
hope
for
some
means
of
escape
and
away
sped
the
giant
across
the
fields
and
then
the
poor
pumpkin
knew
he
was
being
carried
to
the
castle
under
ground
where
the
giant
lived
and
that
he
would
never
come
out
alive
oh
dear
how
he
shivered
and
shook
and
pretty
soon
down
went
the
giant
over
a
long
pair
of
steps
two
at
a
time
then
down
some
more
till
the
poor
pumpkin
s
head
became
quite
dizzy
and
at
last
he
stopped
and
stamped
on
the
ground
and
mr
tip
top
was
very
sure
this
time
that
it
thundered
what
ho
screamed
the
giant
is
everybody
asleep
that
you
do
not
come
when
i
call
and
there
was
a
great
scampering
and
all
the
little
giants
and
mrs
giant
and
all
the
servants
came
running
as
fast
as
could
be
and
the
ground
shook
like
everything
till
poor
mr
tip
top
thought
he
should
die
of
fright
see
what
i
ve
brought
cried
the
giant
in
a
dreadful
voice
and
he
tipped
up
his
pocket
and
out
rolled
the
yellow
pumpkin
all
the
giants
and
giantesses
and
mrs
giant
raced
after
him
with
dreadful
big
steps
but
he
rolled
under
a
big
stone
chair
cut
out
of
the
side
of
the
rock
that
the
cave
was
made
of
oh
save
me
save
me
he
cried
and
he
began
to
cry
as
hard
as
he
could
i
ll
catch
him
cried
every
one
of
those
dreadful
creatures
hunting
for
him
and
at
last
one
great
big
giant
boy
seized
him
and
carried
him
off
in
triumph
but
the
others
ran
after
him
trying
to
get
the
pumpkin
away
and
there
was
such
a
dreadful
time
as
they
tossed
poor
mr
tip
top
back
and
forth
like
a
big
yellow
ball
that
his
head
spun
round
and
round
on
his
shoulders
until
old
father
giant
roared
out
stop
playing
with
him
for
the
pot
is
boiling
hot
now
and
i
m
going
to
have
him
for
my
supper
i
won
t
wait
for
the
elephant
and
the
little
lions
for
i
m
very
very
and
the
pumpkin
was
so
scared
at
that
that
he
gave
a
great
jump
and
rolled
away
into
a
crack
in
the
floor
and
although
every
one
of
those
giants
and
giantesses
got
down
on
their
knees
and
flattened
their
faces
to
see
him
they
couldn
t
get
him
out
and
old
father
giant
in
great
anger
said
he
would
have
to
stay
there
till
the
next
day
when
he
would
send
for
the
carpenter
to
take
up
the
floor
then
he
should
be
boiled
in
the
pot
for
a
sweet
morsel
with
his
dinner
oh
how
poor
mr
tip
top
shivered
and
shook
and
about
the
middle
of
the
night
when
not
a
single
person
was
awake
and
every
thing
was
as
still
as
a
mouse
there
came
a
little
call
just
beside
the
crack
pumpkin
say

for

on
if
they
didn
i
know
it
said
mr
tip
top
quite
humbly
oh

me
out
well
i
will
said
johnny
but
you
must
do
just
as
i
so
the
yellow
pumpkin
promised
he
would
and
johnny
ran
around
the
outside
of
the
cave
and
pretty
soon
mr
tip
top
heard
him
say
roll
over
so
the
yellow
pumpkin
rolled
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
and
there
was
a
hole
big
enough
for
him
to
get
out
of
and
oh
in
a
minute
there
he
was
out
in
the
fresh
air
and
then
johnny
said
roll
home
now
as
fast
as
you
can
i
m
going
to
stay
and
scare
the
big
giant
and
mrs
giant
and
all
the
little
giants
and
cut
their
heads
oh

johnny
cried
mr
tip
top
and
he
burst
out
crying
do

home
he
ll
kill
you
and
chew
your
head
pshaw
no
he
won
t
said
johnny
and
i
ve
got
to
kill
that
old
giant
and
mrs
giant
and
all
those
dreadful
giantesses
else
they
ll
steal
all
our
pumpkins
see
what
i
ve
got
and
he
ran
behind
a
big
tree
and
came
out
again
with
a
perfectly
horrible
head
of
a
wild
beast
with
flaming
eyes
and
a
big
mouth
and
oh
a
screamed
percy
and
van
and
dick
together
polly
nodded
gayly
and
dashed
on
mr
tip
top
took
one
look
at
it
and
he
said
very
bravely
i
m
going
to
stay
too
and
help
you
make
me
look
like
so
in
two
minutes
mr
tip
top
had
flaming
eyes
in
him
and
a
horrible
big
mouth
out
of
which
he
kept
saying
now
we
ll
scare
them
twice
as
soon
come
on
johnny
and
in
they
crept
into
the
cave
oh
dear
you
never
heard
such
screams
and
roars
the
giant
called
for
his
sword
and
his
servants
and
then
he
huddled
under
the
and
pulled
them
up
over
his
ears
so
johnny
cut
off
his
head
easy
enough
and
mrs
giant
ran
screaming
out
of
the
cave
and
she
was
going
so
fast
she
couldn
t
stop
herself
running
down
the
hill
and
so
she
rolled
into
the
pond
at
the
bottom
and
all
the
little
giant
boys
and
girls
ran
this
way
and
that
and
climbed
into
the
trees
so
they
were
all
caught
and
the
servants
too
and
then
johnny
took
a
great
piece
of
he
had
brought
along
in
his
pocket
and
stuck
the
stone
door
fast
so
it
couldn
t
be
opened
and
then
away
he
and
mr
tip
top
went
home
and
farmer
stebbins
was
so
pleased
with
mr
tip
top
that
he
said
he
should
sit
up
on
top
of
the
big
old
clock
in
the
kitchen
and
there
he
is
now
i
suppose
finished
polly
with
a
flourish
xv
the
robbers
and
their
bags
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
what
shall
i
tell
about
she
had
just
run
into
the
library
after
her
music
lesson
was
over
and
monsieur
had
tripped
off
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
his
waxed
trembling
with
delight
in
his
enthusiasm
over
mademoiselle
peppaire
and
her
progress
i
can
t
think
of
an
earthly
thing
to
make
a
story
of
and
she
wrinkled
her
brows
in
dismay
let
her
off
van
cried
jasper
no
no

cried
van
in
alarm
she
said
she
d
tell
a
story
as
soon
as
she
got
through
her
music
yes
she
did
said
percy
and
it
rains
and
we
can
t
go
out
you
know
jasper
and
he
gazed
dismally
from
the
long
window
oh
i
ll
tell
it
polly
made
haste
to
say
i
did
promise
it
boys
and
you
shall
have
it
so
come
over
here
and
she
ran
to
the
corner
with
the
cushioned
seats
under
the
windows
now
then
let
me
see
oh
i
ll
tell
you
about
the
robbers
and
their
bags
she
announced
saying
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
oh
oh
oh
screamed
the
boys
in
the
greatest
glee
while
little
dick
quite
overcome
with
the
idea
rushed
out
in
the
hall
to
proclaim
the
fact
to
the
first
person
he
might
meet
who
chanced
to
be
his
grandfather
polly
s
going
to
tell
us
a
story
about
robbers
and
she
s
got
bags
and
just
everything
he
screamed
excitedly
dick
exclaimed
old
king
whose
plans
for
the
day
had
all
been
set
aside
by
the
rain
you
must
look
where
you
are
going
child
and
not
run
into
people
so
as
little
dick
stumbled
up
against
him
but
she
is
grandpapa
she
really
and
truly
is
cried
dick
positively
who
is
and
going
to
do
what
demanded
king
polly
and
she
s
going
to
tell
us
a
perfectly
splendid
and
then
away
dick
dashed
back
to
the
library
again
in
that
case
observed
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
i
might
as
well
add
myself
to
the
youngsters
and
phronsie
will
probably
be
so
as
he
had
been
waiting
till
polly
should
be
through
with
her
music
lesson
for
phronsie
always
sat
patiently
with
one
of
her
numerous
dolls
in
the
long
on
these
occasions
he
marched
to
the
scene
of
the
hilarity
over
the
story
which
was
now
fairly
launched
and
so
you
see
polly
was
saying
as
he
opened
the
door
oh
boys
here
comes
dear
grandpapa
all
the
boys
were
on
their
feet
in
an
instant
to
get
old
king
the
best
chair
in
the
room
an
attention
which
pleased
him
immensely
and
he
was
soon
seated
in
their
circle
joel
planting
himself
down
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
phronsie
looked
over
from
polly
s
lap
where
she
was
snuggling
does
your
head
ache
grandpapa
she
asked
gently
it
feels
as
if
it
were
going
to
all
the
while
phronsie
said
the
old
gentleman
artfully
phronsie
put
up
one
little
hand
and
patted
polly
s
cheek
i
must
go
and
sit
with
grandpapa
polly
she
whispered
and
keep
him
from
being
and
she
got
down
and
hurried
over
to
climb
in
his
lap
now
i
guess
it
won
t
ache
grandpapa
dear
she
said
smoothing
his
white
hair
gently
it
won
t
now
you
are
here
phronsie
said
old
king
holding
her
close
now
then
polly
my
girl

wrathfully

said
van
pleasantly
who

o
van
exclaimed
polly

old

now
then
polly
begin
so
polly
with
a
nod
and
a
reassuring
smile
for
him
rushed
on
well
you
see
these
robbers
lived
in
a
cave
dark
and
big
it
was
against
a
mountain
around
which
ran
a
lonely
road
nobody
ever
went
that
way
who
could
help
it
because
for
years
and
years
robbers
had
been
there
and
scared
all
the
travellers
away
so
you
see
the
robbers
had
it
pretty
much
to
themselves
well
at
the
end
of
the
long
and
lonely
road
was
a
little
village
it
was
about
as
big
as
badgertown
but
not
nearly
so
pretty
said
polly
with
a
light
in
her
brown
eyes
bad
ger
began
joel
ugh
exclaimed
van
at
him
while
grandpapa
held
up
a
warning
finger
yes
it
was
just
about
as
big
said
polly
well
there
were
some
men
who
were
pretty
rich
lived
there
in
fine
smart
houses
about
six
no
i
guess
a
dozen
of
them
and
the
robbers
had
waited
a
good
while
to
see
if
they
would
come
down
their
long
and
lonely
road
but
they
never
had
for
you
see
whenever
they
had
to
get
to
the
next
place
they
went
clear
away
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
so
kept
off
from
the
dreadful
robbers
and
their
cave
well
so
one
night
all
the
robbers
sat
and
made
up
a
plan
and
how
many
began
joel
abruptly
but
one
look
at
old
king
stopped
him
well
there
were
just
about
a
hundred
robbers
said
polly
seeing
it
was
expected
of
her
to
have
a
good
number
oh
my
exclaimed
percy
and
they
all
decided
that
as
the
splendid
rich
men
who
lived
in
the
big
houses
wouldn
t
come
to
them
they
would
go
after
oh
dear
said
little
dick
yes
and
so
the
head
robber
oh
he
was
too
perfectly
splendid
to
look
at
cried
polly
waxing
enthusiastic
as
she
looked
at
her
absorbed
audience
he
was
all
dressed
up
in
red
velvet
and
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
that
trailed
off
in
the
air
and
he
had
a
long
sword
in
his
belt
and
it
clanked
every
step
he
took
and
two
or
three
knives
and
pistols
oh
and
other
things
stuck
in
round
his
waist
so
he
was
perfectly
dreadful
too
well
he
told
twelve
of
his
robbers
to
go
and
catch
the
splendid
rich
men
and
get
all
their
money
and
how
did
they
get
it
polly
cried
percy
ho
ho
who
s
interrupting
now
cried
van
bursting
into
a
laugh
hush
said
jasper
over
at
percy
who
ducked
immediately
you
ll
see
said
polly
gayly
well
so
one
dark
night
oh
you
couldn
t
see
your
hand
before
your
face
hardly
don
t
you
think
all
the
twelve
splendid
rich
men
got
twelve
letters
i
mean
each
man
got
one
saying
he
was
to
go
off
just
as
quick
as
he
could
go
over
to
the
big
house
where
the
minister
lived
cause
he
wanted
to
see
him
on
very
important
business
indeed
and
he
couldn
t
wait
a
minute
so
every
single
one
of
those
twelve
splendid
rich
men
started
from
his
home
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
and
before
he
had
gone
very
far
he
met
a
man
he
didn
t
see
him
it
was
so
dark
but
he
ran
up
against
him
and
they
nearly
knocked
each
other
over
stop
there
roared
the
man
that
the
man
who
was
running
knocked
up
against
what
are
you
doing
tumbling
me
down
in
this
fashion
oh
i
didn
t
mean
to
said
the
poor
man
very
humbly
and
he
couldn
t
breathe
very
well
because
you
see
he
d
been
running
so
fast
and
he
d
bumped
into
the
other
one
so
suddenly
i
won
t
do
it
again
but
the
minister
i
expect
is
sick
so
excuse
me
and
he
tried
to
go
by
no
you
don
t
go
any
farther
roared
the
other
man
at
him
in
a
dreadful
voice
and
he
pulled
out
from
under
his
arm
a
big
bag
and
popped
it
over
the
head
of
the
poor
man
who
had
been
running
and
then
he
tumbled
him
upside
down
and
shook
him
around
in
the
bag
down
into
the
bottom
of
it
and
then
he
tied
up
the
o
polly
tied
up
the
man
s
neck
asked
ben
no
i
mean
the
neck
of
the
bag
said
polly
then
he
set
the
bag
with
the
man
in
it
on
a
big
stone
by
the
roadside
now
there
you
must
stay
till
i
come
for
you
he
said
and
he
laughed
as
hard
as
he
could
and
hopped
off
in
the
oh
oh
oh
cried
all
the
group
with
smothered
exclamations
yes
and
away
he
went
to
find
the
other
eleven
robbers
they
each
had
a
bag
you
know
just
like
his
well
every
time
one
of
them
met
one
of
the
splendid
rich
men
running
to
the
minister
s
house
why
the
robber
pulled
out
his
big
bag
from
under
his
arm
and
popped
it
over
the
other
man
s
head
and
turned
him
upside
down
and
shook
him
into
the
bottom
of
the
bag
and
then
tied
up
the
neck
the
neck
of
the
bag
i
mean
and
then
put
him
on
a
big
stone
by
the
roadside
and
told
him
to
stay
there
until
he
came
back
for
him
and
then
those
twelve
robbers
just
looked
at
each
other
and
said
they
wanted
to
sit
down
and
i
should
think
they
d
want
to
said
ben
under
his
breath
well
and
then
one
of
them
said
suddenly
come
now
let
s
go
to
the
first
house
belonging
to
those
men
in
the
bags
we
ll
find
bushels
of
gold
i
expect
in
the
cellar
and
and
did
they
screamed
van
forgetting
himself
ho
ho
who
s
talking
now
cried
percy
with
a
disagreeable
little
laugh
hush
said
old
king
holding
up
a
warning
finger
at
both
of
them
and
so
they
ran
softly
off
on
the
tips
of
their
toes
said
polly
hurrying
on
and
before
any
one
could
breathe
hardly
there
they
were
in
the
house
of
one
of
the
perfectly
splendid
rich
men
now
there
was
a
wise
old
cat
there
living
in
that
very
house
she
was
all
black
but
two
green
eyes
no
i
guess
this
cat
had
yellow
eyes
yellow
with
long
black
stripes
in
them
that
grew
big
when
she
was
angry
now
she
knew
everything
almost
and
she
was
as
good
as
she
was
clever
well
she
just
softly
tripped
along
to
her
mistress
s
bed
and
hopped
up
and
whispered
in
her
ear
don
t
you
be
afraid
mistress
dear
but
lie
perfectly
still
and
i
ll
take
care
of
those
robber
men
and
won
t
let
them
hurt
you
so
the
mistress
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
she
was
a
nice
cat
said
phronsie
pausing
in
her
work
of
patting
old
king
s
white
hair
to
turn
and
look
at
polly
and
i
like
her
i
do
as
polly
sent
a
smile
over
to
her
and
then
raced
on
well
the
cat
ran
off
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
and
hopped
up
to
the
kitchen
shelf
and
took
down
in
her
mouth
a
long
sharp
knife
and
then
she
flew
out
of
the
back
door
i
tell
you
oh
so
fast
and
away
off
and
pretty
soon
she
came
up
to
a
big
bag
with
a
man
inside
it
sitting
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
master
dear
she
cried
hopping
up
to
put
her
mouth
close
to
the
bag
is
that
you
oh
dear
me
yes
said
the
poor
man
in
the
bag
in
a
muffled
voice
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
get
well
said
the
wise
old
cat
i
ll
let
you
out
in
a
so
she
took
the
sharp
knife
in
her
paw
and
she
just
slashed
it
good
through
the
string
that
tied
up
the
neck
of
the
bag
and
in
a
minute
out
popped
the
man
and
stood
up
on
his
feet
and
then
they
heard
a
cry
oh
dear
me
i
d
like
to
get
out
and
don
t
you
think
right
around
the
corner
was
another
big
bag
with
a
man
inside
it
all
tied
up
around
the
neck
and
sitting
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
and
so
the
man
that
had
just
got
out
and
his
wise
old
cat
who
slipped
the
sharp
knife
into
her
mouth
again
rushed
around
the
corner
and
the
cat
took
the
knife
in
her
paw
before
her
master
had
a
chance
to
and
she
just
slashed
it
through
the
string
that
tied
up
the
bag
and
in
a
minute
that
man
too
was
out
and
standing
on
his
feet
on
the
phronsie
laughed
in
delight
and
clapped
her
hands
polly
i
like
that
cat
and
she
s
good
she
cried
again
dreadfully
excited
so
she
is
pet
cried
polly
nodding
away
to
her
then
she
raced
on
well
those
two
men
stared
into
each
other
s
faces
and
one
said
well
i
declare
how
do
you
do
brown
and
the
other
man
said
well
i
declare
how
do
you
do
smith
and
just
then
they
all
heard
a
little
cry
and
around
another
corner
was
another
bag
all
tied
up
just
as
the
other
two
had
been
and
sitting
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
and
then
the
wise
old
cat
did
just
as
she
had
done
before
and
pretty
soon
there
were
three
men
standing
up
quite
straight
on
the
ground
and
they
all
said
this
is
perfectly
dreadful
isn
t
it
now
i
tell
you
sirs
said
the
wise
old
cat
sitting
down
before
them
and
staring
at
them
very
hard
i
ve
got
a
plan
in
my
head
and
you
must
do
as
i
indeed
you
must
whispered
her
master
to
the
others
because
when
she
looks
like
that
she
knows
how
to
do
things
and
she
s
got
something
on
her
just
as
soon
as
we
find
all
the
men
in
this
town
who
are
tied
up
in
bags
and
set
on
stones
by
the
roadside
and
get
them
out
said
the
wise
old
cat
we
must
hurry
right
home
but
we
ve
got
to
have
twelve
men
and
she
bobbed
her
head
to
herself
but
she
didn
t
tell
her
master
that
there
were
twelve
robbers
in
his
house
for
you
see
she
had
counted
them
and
all
this
while
those
twelve
robbers
were
eating
up
the
that
belonged
to
that
cat
s
mistress
and
there
she
was
going
to
have
all
the
cousins
over
to
dinner
the
very
next
day
and
those
dreadful
robbers
sat
on
the
kitchen
table
and
ate
and
ate
and
ate
and
then
they
drank
up
all
the
phronsie
stirred
uneasily
and
looked
very
sad
over
this
so
polly
hastened
to
say
before
she
could
ask
the
question
except
some
in
the
pitcher
up
on
the
top
shelf
that
was
put
there
for
the
littlest
little
but
still
phronsie
s
face
was
very
grave
won
t
there
be
any
left
for
that
nice
old
cat
when
she
gets
home
polly
she
asked
you
must
make
some
be
reserved
for
that
cat
polly
said
grandpapa
nodding
furiously
over
at
polly
dear
me
yes
we
wouldn
t
let
that
wise
old
cat
go
without
hers
exclaimed
polly
quickly
such
a
dear
as
she
is
oh
there
was
a
whole
bowl
full
phronsie
on
another
shelf
clear
way
back
that
the
robbers
didn
t
see
phronsie
leaned
back
and
put
her
head
on
old
king
s
breast
while
she
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
please
tell
some
more
polly
she
begged
well
so
the
wise
old
cat
gave
three
nods
over
to
the
three
men
waiting
there
for
her
to
tell
them
things
and
she
said
to
each
of
them
now
put
your
bag
under
your
arm
you
ll
want
it
before
long
and
follow
me
and
away
she
trotted
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
till
she
had
found
and
untied
nine
other
men
inside
of
big
bags
and
sitting
on
stones
on
the
roadside
um
said
the
cat
her
paw
on
her
mouth
i
guess
this
is
all
anyway
we
ve
got
twelve
now

must
run

was
waiting
there
on
the
front
as
they
all
came
puffing
and
panting
up
now
do
just
as
i
say
she
whispered
into
their
ears
and
each
of
you
pick
out
the
robber
you
see
first
as
you
go
in
and
rush
up
and
pop
your
bag
over
his
head
and
tie
it
down
fast
with
your
string
before
he
can
scream
they
re
just
getting
through
eating
for
you
see
while
she
was
waiting
for
these
men
to
come
she
had
taken
the
time
to
creep
along
the
and
peep
within
the
kitchen

her
master
eating
up
my
wife
s
the
villains
now

cat
commanded

and
in
they
rushed
and
every
man
caught
a
robber
by
flopping
his
big
bag
over
his
head
before
he
saw
him
coming
and
then
they
every
one
tied
the
neck
of
the
bag
up
just
as
it
had
been
done
before
and
while
the
robbers
wriggled
and
screamed
and
beat
and
kicked
as
the
bags
were
shaken
up
and
down
they
couldn
t
get
out
and
the
wise
old
cat
went
around
to
each
bag
yes

said
quite
satisfied
the
knots

all
oh

joel
and
everybody
was
so
delighted
with
the
capture
of
the
robbers
that
they
forgot
to
reprove
him
and
phronsie
clapped
her
little
hands
and
crowed
and
laughed
with

warningly

exclaimed
polly
well
and
then
the
cat
cried
in
a
very
loud
voice
now
i
must
go
and
wake
so
she
ran
up
into
the
bedroom
and
she
skipped
upon
the
bed
and
she
called
close
to
her
ear
wake
up
mistress

robbers

caught
and
waiting

so
her
mistress
turned
over
and
opened
her
eyes
and
she
looked
at
the
cat
and
said
is
that
so
and
then
she
sat
up
straight
and
then
she
hopped
off
from
the
bed
and
ran
down
the
stairs
after
the
wise
old
cat
shoulder
your
bags
every
one
of
you
commanded
the
cat
running
into
the
kitchen
and
she
jumped
up
to
the
table
to
see
that
they
obeyed
and
every
man
picked
up
the
bag
that
had
the
robber
inside
it
that
he
had
caught
and
he
swung
it
off
up
on
his
shoulder

joel
beating
his
hands
together
in
great

phronsie
said
jasper
with
a
smile
polly
thanked
him
with
a
little
nod
and
hurried
on
well
so
you
see
off
they
all
went
to
jail
it
was
a
great
big
stone
house
oh
as
big
as
three
or
four
houses
that
folks
live
in
and
there
was
a
row
of
pens
that
asked
joel
abruptly
dear
me
no
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
they
were
prisoners
pens
and
the
wise
old
cat
just
raced
along
as
hard
as
she
could
all
the
twelve
men
with
their
bags
on
their
backs
coming
after
and
she
spoke
up
as
bold
as
you
please
to
the
man
at
the
gate
who
had
a
big
iron
key
in
his
hand
oh
as
big
as
could
be
i
ve
got
a
dozen
robbers
for
you
to
shut
up
and
keep
at
that
the
man
at
the
gate
put
his
big
key
in
the
lock
open
flew
the
gate
and
in
went
all
the
dozen
robbers
in
their
bags
on
the
twelve
men
s
backs
with
the
wise
old
cat
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
in
a
minute
they
were
each
in
one
of
the
little
pens
and
illustration
the
robbers
and
their
bags
couldn
t
they
take
off
the
bags
then
polly
cried
phronsie
please
let
them
for
a
very
little
bit
of
a
yes
said
polly
they
did
the
wise
old
cat
asked
the
gateman
who
locked
them
all
in
to
undo
the
bags
but
you
can
have
only
your
heads
out
said
the
gateman
to
the
robbers
clanking
his
big
key
against
the
wall
so
you
can
see
and
he
tied
the
bags
all
up
around
their
necks
each
head
stuck
out
you
know
and
the
bag
was
drawn
up
in
a
ruffle
and
tied
oh
exclaimed
phronsie
but
that
was
much
better
said
jasper
cheerfully
just
think
phronsie
to
get
their
heads
yes
said
phronsie
slowly
and
the
next
day
the
judge
the
man
who
sat
on
a
platform
at
the
end
of
the
big
hall
told
one
of
the
servants
to
bring
a
big
bell
and
call
everybody
in
and
to
scream
as
loud
as
he
could
twelve
robbers
in
bags
to
be
and
the
people
kept
coming
in
and
coming
in
and
coming
in
until
there
was
only
a
little
path
in
the
centre
for
them
to
bring
the
robbers
in
and
pretty
soon
the
man
with
the
bell
went
up
and
down
and
roared
out
bring
the
robbers
in
and
twelve
other
servants
went
out
and
got
them
and
set
them
up
in
a
row
right
in
front
of
the
judge
on
the
platform
and
were
their
heads
out
asked
phronsie
yes
their
heads
were
all
out
the
bags
were
tied
in
ruffles
you
know
around
their
necks
and
they
tried
to
get
on
their
knees
to
beg
the
judge
not
to
kill
them
but
instead
they
flopped
over
and
the
servants
had
to
go
around
among
them
and
set
them
up
straight
again
well
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
wise
old
cat
sat
up
on
the
platform
the
judge
invited
her
you
know
and
the
judge
whispered
something
to
the
man
with
the
big
bell
and
he
ran
out
and
came
racing
back
with
a
long
knife
and
after
him
came
another
man
wheeling
and
trundling
a
big
grindstone
oh
screamed
joel
in
the
greatest
glee
they
re
going
to
chop
off
all
the
robbers
heads
i
o
polly
began
phronsie
just
ready
to
cry
wait
and
you
ll
see
pet
said
polly
reassuringly
old
king
put
his
hand
over
phronsie
s
small
ones
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
so
she
snuggled
up
against
his
breast
once
more
well
oh
let
me
see
where
was
i
oh
you
are
going
to
chop
off
all
those
robbers
heads
howled
joel
and
van
together
now
said
the
judge
in
a
perfectly
awful
voice
and
looking
at
all
those
dozen
robbers
you
ve
got
to
promise
to
show
the
way
to
your
cave
or
off
go
your
heads
and
he
pointed
to
the
man
sharpening
up
the
long
knife
on
the
grindstone
the
robbers
shook
so
in
their
bags
they
all
flopped
over
again
and
rolled
on
the
floor
so
somebody
had
to
go
and
set
them
all
straight
in
a
row
once
more
hurry
up
cried
the
judge
and
say
yes
for
the
knife
is
the
man
sharpening
up
the
long
knife
began
to
brandish
it
in
the
air
over
the
head
stuck
out
of
the
bag
of
the
robber
first
in
the
line
ow
screamed
the
robber
trying
to
draw
his
head
under
the
ruffle
i
say
and
i
say
yes
screamed
every
one
of
the
rest
of
the
robbers
huddling
as
best
they
could
under
their
ruffles
very
well
then
said
the
judge
so
the
man
with
the
knife
laid
it
down
by
the
grindstone
and
the
judge
gave
his
hand
to
the
cat
you
must
go
to
the
cave
he
said
and
capture
the
rest
of
the
joel
and
van
who
were
horribly
disappointed
when
the
man
put
up
his
knife
now
brightened
up
at
prospect
of
livelier
work
and
more
to
their
taste
at
the
cave
do
hurry
polly
they
clamored
well
then
the
judge
told
the
man
who
had
rung
the
bell
to
jingle
it
again
and
scream
out
men
wanted
at
once
because
you
see
he
knew
there
were
just
one
hundred
robbers
in
all
and
when
they
came
in
he
told
them
to
go
out
and
get
a
bag
apiece
just
like
the
ones
the
twelve
robbers
were
in
and
pretty
soon
they
were
all
ready
and
off
they
started
with
the
wise
old
cat
at
the
head
and
after
her
came
the
twelve
men
with
the
robbers
in
the
bags
all
but
their
heads
because
you
see
those
would
have
to
be
out
for
them
to
see
the
way
and
the
robbers
said
left
right
as
they
had
to
turn
all
along
the
way
to
the
cave
down
the
long
and
lonely
road
well
and
finally
they
reached
the
place
and
they
stopped
and
listened
they
are
boiling
their
for
supper
said
one
of
the
robbers
because
you
see
all
the
men
made
them
tell
things
this
is
the
time
then
said
the
wise
old
cat
to
the
first
robber
now
do
you
call
out
big
and
loud
to
let
you
so
the
robber
did
it
he
had
to
you
know
and
a
voice
inside
said
oh
that
you
jim
back
again
and
the
great
stone
door
flew
open
and
just
as
quick
as
you
could
think
there
they
were
all
inside
and
every
man
pulled
out
a
bag
from
under
his
arms
and
flopped
it
over
the
head
of
a
robber
all
except
the
robber
who
was
stirring
the
over
a
big
iron
kettle
he
fell
into
the
kettle
instead
because
he
ducked
his
head
when
he
saw
the
bag
coming
well
and
oh
they
were
all
hauled
off
to
jail
but
first
the
nice
old
cat
took
some
she
had
been
wise
enough
to
bring
with
her
from
the
jail
and
she
stuck
the
big
stone
door
all
up
tight
so
that
no
more
robbers
could
use
that
cave
and
the
judge
sentenced
all
the
hundred
robbers
in
a
bunch
to
a
desert
island
where
there
wasn
t
any
cave
nor
anybody
else
not
a
single
person
besides
themselves
so
they
were
all
taken
off
in
boats
the
next
day
and
and
could
they
get
out
of
their
bags
then
asked
phronsie
with
a
long
breath
yes
after
they
got
to
the
island
said
polly
but
not
a
single
minute
before
and
as
soon
as
they
rolled
them
out
of
the
boats
the
men
who
brought
them
untied
the
bags
and
said
scat
and
away
ran
the
robbers
and
were
never
seen
xvi
polly
pepper
s
yes
indeed
jasper
cried
polly
i
ll
tell
about
the
i
made
only
twasn
t
a
at
all
and
she
broke
off
into
a
merry
laugh
hold
on
cried
ben
you
ll
spoil
it
all
polly
tell
the
story
first
that
s
so
i
will
said
polly
well
in
the
first
place
none
of
us
in
the
little
brown
house
ever
knew
where
it
came
from
to
begin
with
ben
found
it
one
day
in
a
swamp
down
by
the
meadow
as
he
was
digging
to
sell
to
get
some
money
to
buy
a
pair
of
boots
for
the
winter
it
wasn
t
hurt
in
the
least
only
it
was
so
small
it
couldn
t
get
out
the
wonder
is
how
it
ever
got
there
at
all
however
ben
didn
t
care
for
that
so
long
as
he
could
get
master
chick
in
his
possession
so
he
took
an
old
and
by
dint
of
poking
and
urging
the
chicken
which
didn
t
want
to
come
and
by
floundering
and
tumbling
round
in
the
bog
till
he
was
pretty
wet
himself
at
last
he
caught
it
oh
you
must
know
it
was
a
fine
black
chicken
a
shanghai
and
ben
grasped
it
oh
so
tightly
under
one
arm
and
he
flew
home
and
bursting
into
the
door
he
scared
us
and
he
most
upset
me
i
was
helping
mamsie
to
pull
out
the
of
the
coat
she
had
just
finished
and
goodness
me
how
that
chicken
did
scream
illustration
ben
grasped
it
tightly
under
one
arm
and
flew
home
yes
and
so
did
you
most
as
bad
said
ben
bursting
into
a
laugh
i
never
will
forget
you
said
i
d
scared
you
most
to
well
and
so
you
did
declared
polly
we
didn
t
see
that
dreadful
chicken
till
you
flapped
it
in
our
faces
it
was
lucky
that
the
children
weren
t
there
or
i
don
t
know
but
what
the
roof
of
the
little
brown
house
would
have
flown
off
with
the
where
were
the
children
demanded
percy
joel
twisted
uneasily
it
had
always
been
a
great
trial
to
think
of
his
absence
on
such
a
momentous
occasion
polly
answered
briskly
why
the
two
boys
were
down
in
farmer
brown
s
there
was
a
little
hole
full
of
water
something
like
a
pond
you
know
and
they
were
sailing
boats
and
oh
dear
me
i
wish
we
hadn
t
been
grunted
joel
i
d
rather
have
seen
the
black
chicken
come
and
phronsie
had
been
put
to
bed
early
it
was
almost
dark
you
know
and
she
was
tired
out
so
mamsie
and
i
were
all
and
mamsie
thought
it
was
a
crow
said
ben
to
mother
pepper
who
still
was
at
work
over
her
the
same
as
ever
didn
t
you
mamsie
yes
said
pepper
with
a
smile
at
the
remembrance
he
was
more
like
a
crow
children
i
m
sure
than
anything
else
he
was
so
oh
how
i
wish
we
could
have
seen
it
exclaimed
percy
and
van
together
and
ben
said
he
d
give
me
half
of
the
chicken
ran
on
polly
and
then
we
could
have
him
for
thanksgiving
and
i
could
make
my
pie
oh
you
ought
to
have
seen
polly
dance
when
i
told
her
that
said
ben
laughing
again
oh
dear
you
did
have
such
good
times
in
the
little
brown
house
cried
percy
enviously
why
couldn
t
we
have
been
there
and
then
we
began
to
count
up
how
long
it
would
be
to
thanksgiving
we
d
never
had
one
you
know
said
polly
never
had
a
thanksgiving
cried
all
the
whitney
children
together
hush
exclaimed
jasper
with
a
warning
pull
at
the
jacket
nearest
to
him
i
remember
said
pepper
laying
down
her
work
it
was
july
then
and
there
were
four
months
to
wait
but
if
we
could
find
out
where
the
chicken
belonged
i
told
you
we
must
give
it
and
did
you
give
it
back
did
you
did
you
clamored
the
whitney
boys
no
said
polly
because
we
couldn
t
find
anybody
who
had
ever
seen
him
so
we
put
him
in
the
shed
where
the
old
gray
goose
was
and
oh
did
you
have
an
old
gray
goose
polly
pepper
cried
van
tell
about
him
so
polly
dilated
at
great
length
on
the
old
gray
goose
how
it
was
the
only
living
thing
they
had
because
they
were
too
poor
to
buy
a
cow
or
a
pig
or
even
a
chicken
and
how
the
old
goose
had
lived
there
ever
since
they
could
remember
and
how
cross
it
was
so
they
couldn
t
play
with
it
and
how
it
bit
sally
brown
one
day
when
she
came
over
with
an
errand
from
her
mother
and
tell
about
how
it
bit
sally
brown
interrupted
van
eagerly
if
you
stop
for
everything
polly
never
ll
get
that
baked
said
ben
yes
said
jasper
now
don
t
interrupt
again
it
s
a
shame
to
have
to
tell
stories
and
be
stopped
every
oh
i
don
t
mind
it
said
polly
brightly
only
if
you
have
all
about
sally
brown
and
everything
else
why
i
sha
n
t
get
through
with
the
go
on
about
the
then
do
polly
said
van
reluctantly
mentally
determining
to
have
the
whole
of
sally
brown
and
the
old
gray
goose
some
time
and
so
polly
ran
on
again
how
they
always
fed
the
old
gray
goose
every
day
most
carefully
and
phronsie
saved
something
from
her
dinner
for
it
most
especially
and
it
used
to
eat
awfully
grumbled
joel
hush
said
ben
and
so
you
see
cried
polly
gayly
how
perfectly
fine
it
was
to
have
such
a
splendid
chicken
come
to
us
seems
as
if
it
was
just
on
purpose
for
thanksgiving
for
you
must
know
that
mamsie
had
promised
us
a
as
soon
as
she
could
manage
it
and
it
was
to
be
all
wings
and
drumsticks
and
and
o
polly
pepper
exclaimed
percy
with
a
little
laugh
chickens
don
t
have
but
one
i
can
t
help
it
retorted
polly
recklessly
seems
as
if
this
was
going
to
be
better
than
any
other
that
was
ever
baked
in
all
this
world
oh
and
the
crust
was
to
be
thick
and
the
gravy
was
to
be
just
lovely
and
phronsie
was
to
have
the
yes
i
was
said
phronsie
with
a
small
sigh
and
folding
her
hands
and
so
you
see
when
mister
shanghai
dropped
down
from
the
clouds
in
the
way
he
did
why
we
were
just
as
happy
as
we
could
be
well
every
day
when
the
work
was
done
up
we
talked
over
just
how
that
pie
was
to
be
baked
and
when
it
was
too
dark
to
see
for
we
didn
t
light
the
candle
any
earlier
than
we
could
help
and
why
didn
t
you
light
the
candle
early
asked
little
dick
pushing
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
group
why
because
we
were
poor
said
polly
and
we
had
to
save
the
candles
as
long
as
we
could
well
and
we
used
to
play
it
really
was
thanksgiving
and
the
table
was
set
and
and
polly
always
played
that
she
had
a
bunch
of
flowers
to
trim
the
chicken
with
said
ben
well
and
now
something
very
dreadful
happened
said
polly
very
dreadful
indeed
i
won
t
tell
you
what
it
was
but
oh
tell
tell
polly
pepper
do
cried
all
the
whitney
boys
in
a
clamor
no
not
just
yet
said
polly
shaking
her
brown
head
decidedly
because
that
would
spoil
the
story
but
i
m
going
to
pretend
that
the
old
gray
goose
and
the
black
chicken
could
talk
together
and
tell
you
what
they
illustration
the
old
gray
goose
holds
a
conversation
with
the
black
chicken
and
then
will
you
tell
us
the
perfectly
dreadful
thing
that
happened
asked
van
anxiously
while
the
others
cried
delightedly
oh
that
will
be
fine
yes
said
polly
with
a
reassuring
nod
over
at
him
i
will
vanny
tell
it
all
well
so
here
is
what
they
said
the
old
gray
goose
began
it
humph
she
said
with
a
very
knowing
look
you
don
t
know
as
much
as
you
will
in
a
short
time
say
in
now
what
november
was
the
chicken
of
course
couldn
t
tell
for
he
had
never
seen
a
november
so
he
asked
the
cross
old
goose
very
plainly
but
very
politely
one
day
to
tell
him
exactly
what
she
did
mean
this
was
the
week
before
thanksgiving
and
it
rained
and
it
was
cold
and
dreary
and
the
two
were
perched
on
a
rail
shivering
with
the
cold
but
what
the
old
gray
goose
was
saying
made
shanghai
shake
and
shiver
worse
than
anything
else
only
he
pretended
that
he
wasn
t
frightened
a
bit
now
you
must
know
that
the
old
gray
goose
was
very
angry
at
the
shanghai
chicken
for
coming
there
at
all
and
when
she
saw
us
all
feed
it
she
got
angrier
and
angrier
till
she
tried
to
say
very
bad
things
indeed
to
that
poor
little
black
that
was
naughty
little
dick
burst
out
vehemently
yes
she
was
very
naughty
indeed
said
phronsie
shaking
her
head
gravely
so
she
was
declared
polly
wait
and
you
ll
see
what
happened
well
she
went
on
and
on
and
talked
and
talked
about
how
the
chicken
was
to
be
baked
in
pieces
in
a
pie
and
all
that
i
ve
seen
em
she
said
with
the
air
of
one
who
knew
everything
year
after
year
hens
and
chickens
yes
and
geese
stepping
around
in
the
morning
oh
so
happy
and
smart
and
then
at
evening
they
would
go
past
here
to
market
all
stiff
and
stark
with
their
heads
off
and
brown
s
boy
holding
them
by
their
legs
all
for
pies
and
so
that
people
may
eat
themselves
sick
and
they
call
it
a
thanksgiving
oh
how
the
chicken
shook
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
fall
off
from
its
perch
but
it
was
very
dark
so
the
old
goose
didn
t
notice
it
shanghai
wouldn
t
for
all
the
world
have
had
her
so
he
controlled
himself
and
being
a
brave
little
fellow
he
stopped
the
beating
of
his
heart
and
he
spoke
up
loud
well
why
weren
t
you
baked
in
a
pie
then
along
with
the
others
what
why
well
stammered
the
goose
they
were
going
to
kill
me
time
and
again
but
well
the
fact
is
they
thought
so
much
of
me
they
couldn
t
bear
in
spite
of
its
fright
the
chicken
couldn
t
help
laughing
softly
to
itself
well
come
you
d
better
go
to
bed
crossly
snapped
the
goose
they
ll
come
for
you
bright
and
early
in
the
morning
i
heard
em
saying
well
then
i
say
declared
the
chicken
drawing
himself
up
on
his
long
legs
till
he
looked
oh
so
tall
they
won
t
find
here
that
s
all
i
ve
got
to
say
why
where
will
you
go
demanded
the
goose
seeing
that
she
had
gone
too
far
in
the
desire
to
make
the
poor
little
chicken
as
unhappy
as
possible
oh
i
m
going
to
set
out
for
my
own
fortune
gayly
replied
the
chicken
at
any
rate
it
can
t
be
any
worse
than
to
be
baked
in
a
pie
i
think
i
see
myself
staying
here
for
no
mrs
goose
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
i
m
off
yes
and
be
stuck
in
a
bog
for
your
pains
scornfully
hissed
the
old
goose
seeing
it
was
useless
to
advise
or
to
urge
further
but
the
chicken
s
long
legs
were
going
at
a
pretty
smart
pace
down
the
hill
and
it
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
it
was
never
seen
by
any
of
us
in
the
little
brown
house
oh
dear
me
screamed
percy
and
van
together
then
you
didn
t
have
any
why
polly
pepper
and
you
said
you
had
one
while
little
dick
roared
steadily
only
the
words
chicken
and
pie
and
oh
dear
oh
dear
could
be
heard
when
the
noise
was
quelled
as
best
it
could
be
by
jasper
and
ben
polly
was
saying
well
that
was
the
very
dreadful
thing
that
happened
you
know
i
told
you
about
and
and
didn
t
you
have
anything
any
pie
any
pie
at
all
screamed
and
wailed
the
whitney
children
beside
themselves
with
distress
so
polly
hastened
to
reassure
them
there
there
don
t
feel
so
boys
you
ll
see
it
all
turned
out
beautifully
after
how
could
it
exclaimed
van
horribly
disappointed
if
you
didn
t
have
any
after
all
you
ll
see
was
all
that
polly
would
tell
him
by
way
of
comfort
as
she
hurried
on
well
twas
a
beautiful
morning
wasn
t
it
ben
cried
polly
when
you
went
out
to
kill
the
chicken
yes
said
ben
but
what
i
remember
most
of
all
was
how
you
all
screamed
and
cried
and
said
you
d
rather
go
without
the
pie
than
to
have
the
chicken
oh
exclaimed
the
little
bunch
of
whitneys
i
know
it
said
polly
and
so
after
all
it
was
better
that
that
black
shanghai
ran
o
polly
pepper
cried
all
the
children
but
phronsie
yes
said
polly
stoutly
i
really
think
it
was
well
never
mind
let
us
go
on
and
hear
the
rest
of
it
joel
was
the
first
one
to
tell
us
the
chicken
had
gone
he
rushed
screaming
in
o
mamsie
mamsie
the
chicken
isn
t
there
oh
dear
me
interrupted
joel
i
and
after
him
came
davie
flying
in
and
then
i
can
t
tell
you
how
we
all
acted
in
that
you
didn
t
polly
said
ben
hastily
all
the
rest
of
us
i
know
i
was
just
as
bad
as
any
of
us
said
polly
well
anyway
then
we
all
went
out
and
hunted
for
the
chicken
and
and
didn
t
you
ever
find
him
demanded
percy
no
she
said
so
before
said
van
she
said
they
never
saw
him
again
don
t
you
know
no
we
couldn
t
find
him
said
polly
to
percy
though
we
hunted
high
and
low
in
the
woodshed
and
the
provision
room
and
all
about
the
house
and
down
in
the
pine
wood
oh
and
over
by
cherry
brook
well
you
can
t
think
how
we
searched
for
that
long
black
chicken
yes
and
ben
ran
down
to
the
swamp
where
he
had
found
it
when
he
was
digging
to
see
if
perhaps
mister
shanghai
had
run
back
there
and
got
stuck
in
the
bog
but
no
he
wasn
t
there
not
a
bit
of
him
so
finally
we
all
had
to
come
home
and
tell
mamsie
that
we
couldn
t
find
him
and
it
rained
dreadfully
all
that
afternoon
and
there
was
the
standing
up
all
ready
in
the
pantry
oh
dear
and
so
we
had
to
tell
stories
to
keep
the
children
from
being
too
sorry
and
forlorn
and
you
did
polly
corrected
ben
i
couldn
t
but
you
told
some
splendid
oh
will
you
tell
us
some
of
those
splendid
stories
polly
pepper
cried
percy
radiantly
will
you
that
you

that
rainy
afternoon
when
the
black
chicken
ran
away
she
s
going
to
tell
us
how
the
old
gray
goose
bit
sally
brown
too
declared
van
positively
not
losing
sight
of
this
future
bliss
and
so
i
will
van
promised
polly
and
i
ll
tell
you
one
of
the
stories
i
told
the
children
on
that
dreadful
afternoon
when
it
rained
and
the
black
chicken
ran
away
but
not
now
i
must
finish
about
the
tell
more
than
one
polly
begged
the
children
tell
us
all
the
stories
you
told
we
ll
see
said
polly
brightly
i
ll
tell
you
some
but
i
don
t
know
as
i
could
tell
you
all
the
stories
i
told
that
dreadful
afternoon
i
had
to
tell
a
good
many
you
know
it
was
so
very
hard
to
get
over
well
now
we
must
hurry
where
was
i
oh
you
said
you
were
telling
stories
shouted
van
first
of
all
yes
i
know
well
it
was
ben
who
first
proposed
the
best
thing
you
could
think
of
in
all
this
world
all
of
a
sudden
he
jumped
up
and
waved
his
hand
like
polly
sprang
to
her
feet
see
here
children
why
not
let
s
have
the
old
gray
goose
she
shouted
and
you
all
screamed
at
me
the
goose
in
great
scorn
said
ben
i
know
we
did
said
polly
humbly
her
hand
falling
to
her
side
but
that
was
because
we
weren
t
as
smart
as
you
were
to
see
what
a
wise
thing
it
was
to
have
the
old
gray
goose
i
remember
you
said
if
we
can
t
have
why
we
must
take
the
next
best
and
that
s
well
you
all
came
around
finely
in
a
little
while
though
said
ben
smiling
at
her
and
mamsie
said
i
think
ben
is
right
and
the
old
gray
goose
is
really
too
cross
to
be
allowed
to
live
for
it
isn
t
safe
to
have
her
around
any
longer
so
she
really
ought
to
be
killed
anyway
and
we
can
boil
her
a
good
while
to
make
her
as
tender
as
possible
so
you
can
have
your
pie
polly
oh
dear
me
said
the
whitney
children
and
polly
said
but
why
couldn
t
the
old
gray
goose
have
run
away
i
wonder
and
that
made
us
all
laugh
said
ben
instead
of
crying
any
oh
i
m
so
glad
screamed
van
and
he
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
floor
in
a
ball
now
the
old
gray
goose
the
bad
naughty
hateful
old
thing
is
going
to
be
killed
instead
of
the
chicken
she
scared
so
am
i
cried
percy
but
he
sat
quite
straight
and
dignified
in
his
chair
only
clapping
his
hands
by
way
of
approval
oh
do
tell
on
polly
he
begged
and
so
the
old
gray
goose
huddling
in
from
the
rain
and
chuckling
to
herself
at
the
state
of
affairs
didn
t
dream
what
was
coming
and
on
the
next
morning
chop
off
went
her
head
and
we
had
our
and
polly
had
some
flowers
on
it
after
all
said
ben
for
at
the
last
minute
a
neighbor
ran
in
with
a
bunch
of
posies
and
she
said
i
m
real
sorry
you
had
such
a
time
about
your
pie
so
you
see
the
old
gray
goose
was
decked
up
fine
after
all
for
polly
stuck
them
in
her
bony
tough
old
and
mamsie
baked
us
such
a
beautiful
pudding
cried
polly
looking
over
at
pepper
with
a
bright
smile
most
all
plums
said
joel
smacking
his
lips
at
the
remembrance
my
wasn
t
it
good
though
and
did
phronsie
get
her
asked
little
dick
anxiously
why
how
could
she
when
the
black
chicken
ran
away
with
it
cried
polly
xvii
phronsie
pepper
s
new
shoes
it
was
such
hard
work
to
make
the
fire
burn
that
morning
said
polly
something
was
the
matter
with
the
old
stove
worse
than
usual
the
big
cracks
seemed
bigger
than
ever
although
ben
had
stuffed
them
up
with
putty
the
week
before
and
what
had
he
stuffed
them
up
for
demanded
little
dick
plunging
into
the
centre
of
the
group
hush
said
van
laying
a
violent
hand
on
his
jacket
do
be
still
you
crowd
so
and
ask
i
don
t
crowd
so
and
ask
questions
said
little
dick
tartly
and
he
turned
a
very
red
face
to
polly
what
did
he
do
so
for
polly
why
we
were
very
poor
you
know
said
polly
and
the
old
stove
was
all
tired
out
it
had
been
baking
so
long
oh
for
years
and
years
and
it
had
big
holes
and
cracks
come
in
it
that
let
the
air
through
and
then
that
put
the
fire
oh
said
little
dick
we
weren
t
so
very
poor
said
joel
uneasily
who
never
could
bear
to
be
pitied
no
not
when
our
ships
came
in
said
ben
soberly
but
his
eyes
twinkled
at
which
polly
laughed
merrily
oh
dear
me
she
cried
wiping
her
eyes
joel
s
ships
were
always
coming
what
do
you
mean
polly
pepper
cried
van
quickly
you
say
so
many
funny
things
what
were
joel
s
ships
and
when
did
they
come
in
now
see
here
said
jasper
if
you
ask
so
many
questions
polly
never
can
get
to
the
story
how
phronsie
got
her
new
shoes
and
to
think
how
you
three
chaps
have
been
teasing
her
to
tell
it
if
i
were
polly
i
wouldn
t
give
you
a
single
scrap
of
but
polly
tossed
him
a
bright
smile
over
her
shoulder
and
dashed
off
again
as
fast
as
she
could
you
see
boys
when
the
putty
that
ben
had
stuffed
into
the
old
stove
tumbled
out
that
morning
i
was
just
going
to
put
my
pans
of
bread
into
the
oven
think
of
that
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
the
whitney
boys
well
there
wasn
t
any
more
putty
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
ben
was
away
at
his
work
so
he
couldn
t
fix
it
and
besides
there
wasn
t
why
didn
t
you
take
some
cotton
wool
cried
van
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
with
a
little
laugh
we
never
had
cotton
wool
that
would
have
been
splendid
most
as
good
as
having
a
new
stove
but
sometimes
davie
used
to
give
us
a
and
a
cried
both
of
the
whitney
boys
together
yes
when
anybody
gave
him
an
old
he
d
save
it
for
the
stove
the
bits
of
leather
stuffed
it
up
just
finely
and
i
d
have
given
a
too
if
i
d
had
it
said
joel
grimly
and
his
chubby
face
lengthened
oh
joel
was
splendid
too
said
polly
turning
a
radiant
face
on
him
he
gave
things
too
and
helped
to
do
the
stuffing
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
ever
have
done
in
all
this
world
without
those
two
boys
and
she
beamed
at
them
well
i
must
hurry
or
you
never
will
hear
about
phronsie
s
new
shoes
oh
where
was
i
why
you
were
stuffing
up
the
old
stove
to
make
it
burn
said
all
the
whitney
boys
together
don
t
you
know
polly
pepper
oh
yes
well
and
i
was
in
the
midst
of
it
when
phronsie
came
out
of
the
bedroom
and
said
oh
i
am
so
hungry
dear
me
and
there
i
was
my
hands
were
just
as
black
as
could
be
and
joel
and
david
were
away
you
know
and
so
phronsie
begged
to
go
to
the
provision
room
herself
to
the
that
always
hung
under
the
steps
and
i
told
her
she
might
illustration
oh
i
am
so
hungry
well
when
she
went
along
said
polly
hurrying
over
this
part
of
it
as
she
thought
she
saw
phronsie
s
head
droop
a
bit
she
took
the
big
out
of
the
cupboard
she
thought
you
know
it
would
help
me
and
the
first
thing
anybody
knew
down
she
rolled
over
those
dreadful
old
rickety
steps
every
one
in
the
group
sat
perfectly
still
as
if
not
daring
to
breathe
and
little
dick
threw
his
arms
around
phronsie
while
his
mouth
worked
dreadfully
as
he
tried
not
to
cry
and
i
cut
my
thumb
said
phronsie
holding
it
up
yes
said
polly
hurrying
on
it
was
only
her
thumb
she
cut
but
how
it
did
scare
me
i
don
t
know
how
i
ever
got
down
over
those
stairs
and
there
she
was
in
a
little
heap
at
the
bottom
and
that
dreadful
old
lying
down
on
the
floor
a
little
way
off
oh
dear
me
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
it
even
now
and
there
were
little
dabs
of
blood
on
her
pink
apron
and
all
over
her
face
but
she
said
it
was
only
her
yes
said
phronsie
gravely
it
was
only
my
and
so
it
was
surely
as
i
soon
found
out
said
polly
drawing
a
long
breath
well
we
soon
got
phronsie
all
yes
said
joel
and
the
first
thing
polly
did
she
said
to
the
old
stove
oh
you
old
naughty
thing
now
think
what
you
ve
done
this
morning
that
s
what
she
told
and
then
i
had
to
get
some
to
stick
the
cut
together
with
said
polly
so
phronsie
sat
in
mamsie
s
old
while
i
ran
over
to
grandma
bascom
s
for
it
for
you
know
of
course
that
if
any
of
us
got
into
any
trouble
why
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
get
into
mamsie
s
chair
if
she
wasn
t
phronsie
put
one
soft
little
hand
on
mother
pepper
s
lap
and
patted
it
and
she
had
cake
said
joel
mamsie
s
chair
and
a
piece
of
cake
yes
there
was
a
piece
that
had
been
given
mamsie
and
we
were
saving
it
up
for
a
treat
that
we
were
to
have
had
that
very
night
but
when
phronsie
got
hurt
why
of
course
she
must
have
it
well
i
thought
grandma
bascom
never
would
find
that
she
wanted
so
to
hear
all
about
how
phronsie
got
hurt
in
the
first
place
and
then
she
didn
t
know
where
she
had
put
the
and
oh
dear
me
i
thought
i
should
fly
to
think
of
poor
phronsie
curled
up
in
the
big
chair
waiting
for
me
but
at
last
grandma
found
it
in
the
cupboard
drawer
and
she
cut
off
a
piece
and
then
it
wasn
t
but
a
minute
or
two
and
the
cut
was
stuck
together
and
tied
up
in
an
old
handkerchief
and
phronsie
s
pink
apron
was
taken
off
and
she
had
a
clean
one
on
and
i
brushed
her
curls
and
everything
was
getting
all
right
again
and
then
in
popped
ben
and
ben
whistled
whew
said
little
davie
just
as
loud
as
he
could
polly
told
us
he
and
they
both
kissed
phronsie
all
around
again
and
ben
kissed
her
the
most
because
he
hadn
t
been
there
at
the
first
said
joel
polly
told
us
oh
and
then
polly
said
oh
let
me
tell
begged
david
in
great
excitement
no
i
began
first
said
joel
i
want
to
myself
yes
he
did
begin
first
davie
said
polly
smiling
into
his
little
eager
face
joel
ought
to
so
joel
began
again
triumphantly
in
a
loud
voice
well
polly
said
oh
i
d
rather
dave
told
you
may
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
looking
over
at
david
no
said
davie
you
began
first
you
tell
but
joel
wants
you
to
davie
said
polly
smiling
over
at
joel
in
a
way
to
make
the
color
fly
up
on
his
round
cheeks
in
his
delight
so
i
let
phronsie
tell
said
joel
that
s
best
go
on
phron
tell
what
polly
she
said
began
phronsie
right
in
bensie
s
ear
she
told
me
so
that
i
ought
to
have
my
new
shoes
yes
she
did
just
think
of
that
exclaimed
old
king
who
hadn
t
spoken
a
word
but
had
sat
quite
still
holding
phronsie
cuddled
up
in
his
arms
i
should
say
so
too
it
was
just
the
time
for
those
new
shoes
to
be
but
polly
didn
t
tell
me
then
said
phronsie
twisting
around
to
look
into
his
face
she
whispered
to
bensie
and
he
whispered
in
her
ear
and
they
told
me
to
just
think
of
that
said
grandpapa
patting
her
small
hand
as
it
lay
confidingly
in
his
big
palm
yes
said
phronsie
they
did
and
polly
said
sh
sh
if
mamsie
will
only
say
well
and
at
in
flew
joel
and
davie
hungry
as
bears
they
were
always
hungry
said
polly
laughing
and
the
bread
was
not
done
and
and
we
had
to
eat
the
old
crusts
in
the
pail
we
always
had
to
grumbled
joel
and
joel
said
he
could
have
rolled
down
the
stairs
without
getting
hurt
said
david
and
he
was
going
to
take
the
and
try
but
i
got
that
away
from
you
sir
said
ben
we
d
had
enough
cuts
for
that
and
i
showed
them
my
thumb
said
phronsie
with
an
important
air
yes
and
polly
took
off
the
handkerchief
but
she
wouldn
t
let
us
peek
under
the
said
david
well
i
guess
not
said
polly
and
then
she
told
us
lots
and
lots
of
stories
said
joel
oh
will
you
tell
them
to
us
polly
pepper
when
you
get
through
about
phronsie
s
new
shoes
begged
the
whitney
boys
all
together
oh
not
said
polly
i
will
some
other
time
they
ve
got
to
be
lots
and
lots
of
them
declared
all
three
together
well
do
let
polly
finish
this
one
first
cried
jasper
father
can
t
you
stop
these
chaps
from
interrupting
her
every
minute
appealing
to
old
king
instead
of
this
the
old
gentleman
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
so
long
and
so
heartily
that
every
one
in
the
room
joined
and
when
they
sobered
down
polly
was
saying
and
then
mamsie
came
home
and
everything
was
all
and
mamsie
said
i
could
have
my
new
shoes
shoes
declared
phronsie
very
much
excited
and
sitting
very
straight
in
old
king
s
lap
she
did
so
she
did
assented
the
old
gentleman
bowing
his
stately
head
gravely
that
s
nothing
said
percy
whitney
in
a
dissatisfied
way
to
have
a
pair
of
shoes
given
you
why
didn
t
they
give
you
something
better
than
that
phronsie
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
i
never
had
a
pair
whole
mine
before
she
said
simply
never
had
a
pair
of
shoes
before
screamed
percy
and
van
together
while
little
dick
made
a
big
o
of
his
mouth
in
utter
astonishment
jasper
leaned
forward
and
tried
to
pull
all
three
jackets
together
gently
boys
said
whitney
laying
a
soft
hand
on
the
shoulder
nearest
to
her
don
t
you
understand
said
polly
that
we
were
very
poor
very
poor
indeed
and
phronsie
had
never
had
a
pair
of
shoes
all
to
herself
the
whitney
boys
had
no
words
to
offer
at
that
but
sat
quite
speechless
and
mamsie
had
promised
them
just
as
soon
as
she
could
get
the
and
i
never
had
any
new
shoes
said
phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
no
i
never
and
one
day
i
heard
her
asking
seraphina
her
doll
do
you
suppose
i
ll
ever
get
my
new
shoes
not
till
i
get
to
be
a
big
woman
i
and
did
you
say
yes
pepper
did
you
did
you
cried
van
jumping
out
from
the
centre
of
the
group
to
precipitate
himself
at
mother
pepper
s
elbow
yes
i
did
said
pepper
smiling
at
him
i
thought
seeing
phronsie
had
got
hurt
it
was
just
the
right
time
for
those
new
shoes
to
be
she
did
she
did
say
yes
proclaimed
van
flying
back
again
as
if
bearing
a
wholly
new
fact
and
i
should
say
so
too
declared
old
king
positively
and
gathering
phronsie
up
closely
in
his
arms
again
well
and
so
it
was
all
really
and
truly
as
phronsie
said
settled
ran
on
polly
once
more
and
now
just
think
phronsie
was
to
have
her
new
shoes
and
all
to
herself
it
was
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
of
this
announcement
upon
her
auditors
as
polly
made
this
statement
most
impressively
and
she
rushed
on
and
ben
was
to
run
over
and
ask
deacon
brown
if
we
couldn
t
have
his
green
wagon
and
and
we
were
to
sit
in
behind
shouted
joel
dave
and
me
oh
g
lang
didn
t
we
have
fun
though
cracking
an
imaginary
whip
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
van
discontentedly
and
rolling
over
on
the
library
rug
why
couldn
t
we
ever
have
lived
in
a
little
brown
house
and
sat
in
behind
in
a
green
mamma
screamed
little
dick
with
cheeks
all
aflame
and
plunging
up
to
whitney
s
side
can
t
we
can
t
we
what
dear
asked
whitney
sit
in
behind
in
a
green
wagon
can
t
we
mamma
just
like
polly
and
phronsie
and
ha
ha
polly
and
phronsie
didn
t
sit
in
behind
shouted
joel
they
sat
on
the
seat
with
ben
dave
and
me
sat
i
sat
with
polly
and
bensie
announced
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
in
delight
and
drawing
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
i
could
see
the
horse
and
we
were
going
to
get
yes
she
wanted
them
said
ben
nodding
to
the
others
oh
it
just
scared
me
for
i
was
afraid
we
couldn
t
get
but
we
did
declared
phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
positively
oh
beautiful
ones
grandpapa
and
she
turned
to
him
confidingly
bless
your
heart
exclaimed
old
king
suddenly
and
patting
her
little
hands
so
you
did
dear
me
yes
to
be
well
it
was
a
time
to
get
phronsie
ready
the
next
day
said
polly
with
a
long
sigh
dear
me
i
thought
i
never
should
get
through
and
then
she
had
to
sit
in
her
little
chair
and
wait
for
the
rest
of
us
and
for
ben
to
bring
the
horse
and
the
green
wagon
from
deacon
brown
s
oh
and
we
were
so
afraid
it
would
rain
just
suppose
it
had
and
she
brought
up
suddenly
at
the
direful
prospect
and
did
it
did
it
rain
cried
percy
anxiously
pulling
her
sleeve
no
it
was
clear
as
a
bell
said
polly
oh
you
can
t
think
how
beautiful
that
day
was
seems
to
me
i
never
saw
the
sun
shine
any
brighter
twas
just
as
if
it
were
made
for
us
and
mamsie
stood
on
the
to
see
us
go
and
the
last
thing
she
said
was
be
sure
not
to
get
them
rights
and
lefts
they
ll
wear
longer
and
get
them
plenty
broad
and
i
had
her
purse
with
the
money
in
and
joe
and
david
were
just
dreadful
said
ben
as
polly
stopped
a
minute
to
take
breath
they
dangled
their
legs
out
the
back
of
the
wagon
and
they
screamed
and
made
an
awful
racket
we
couldn
t
keep
them
still
they
scared
the
old
horse
most
to
well
he
wouldn
t
go
unless
he
was
scared
said
joel
would
he
dave
no
laughed
davie
and
then
ben
said
he
d
turn
around
and
drive
home
again
if
we
didn
t
stop
so
that
scared
us
and
then
polly
thought
she
d
lost
mamsie
s
purse
with
all
the
money
in
it
and
that
was
worse
than
yes
said
polly
with
a
long
breath
how
frightened
we
all
were
that
was
perfectly
but
she
didn
t
lose
it
polly
didn
t
cried
phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
positively
at
them
all
no
she
truly
didn
t
and
i
had
my
new
shoes
and
they
were
ones
she
brought
up
triumphantly
yes
said
ben
that
was
the
hardest
part
of
it
all
phronsie
wanted
ones
and
that
scared
polly
and
me
dreadfully
for
there
was
only
a
little
bit
of
a
chance
that
beebe
would
have
any
you
know
and
but
he
did
interrupted
phronsie
eagerly
and
leaning
forward
to
look
into
old
king
s
face
my
dear
beebe
did
have
shoes
he
did
the
only
answer
the
old
gentleman
gave
was
to
clasp
her
closer
to
his
breast
while
polly
hurried
on
well
a
time
as
we
had
getting
into
old
beebe
s
shop
she
cried
holding
up
both
hands
dear
me
i
thought
we
never
should
begin
to
try
on
those
shoes
and
then
and
there
were
oh
so
many
shoes
cried
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
hanging
up
in
the
window
and
yes
and
rubber
boots
broke
in
joel
i
always
wanted
them
dave
and
i
did
but
we
never
got
them
he
added
under
his
breath
yes
just
lots
and
lots
of
shoes
polly
was
saying
but
that
wasn
t
anything
to
the
ones
inside
why
they
hung
up
all
around
the
shop
just
every
place
a
shoe
could
hang
oh
and
there
were
ever
so
many
in
boxes
too
and
old
beebe
keep
pulling
out
one
after
another
and
he
had
them
tucked
under
the
shelves
and
everywhere
else
and
it
did
smell
so
nice
and
lovely
of
beautiful
leather
she
sighed
in
delight
at
the
remembrance
illustration
tell
about
the
sticks
polly
begged
davie
pulling
gently
at
her
sleeve
and
the
doughnuts
said
joel
i
liked
them
well
i
didn
t
said
david
decidedly
i
liked
the
sticks
so
did
i
said
joel
when
i
was
eating
them
but
the
doughnuts
lasted
longer
so
i
liked
those
and
of
course
we
couldn
t
get
rights
and
lefts
said
polly
because
you
know
mamsie
told
us
they
wouldn
t
wear
as
good
so
it
seemed
as
if
we
never
could
get
phronsie
fitted
in
all
this
and
i
couldn
t
see
any
shoes
in
all
that
shop
declared
ben
to
the
group
hanging
on
every
word
although
i
walked
around
and
around
and
stared
at
everything
with
all
my
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
all
the
auditors
in
great
distress
no
i
couldn
t
and
i
was
just
going
to
give
it
up
and
make
up
my
mind
to
go
home
without
getting
phronsie
any
when
don
t
you
think
old
beebe
said
you
tell
them
polly
what
he
said
and
ben
stopped
quite
tired
out
no
you
tell
said
polly
delighted
to
get
ben
to
talking
and
she
leaned
back
and
folded
her
hands
restfully
well
he
said
began
ben
seeing
that
polly
was
not
really
to
tell
it
i
made
a
pair
once
for
the
squire
s
little
daughter
down
to
the
point
but
her
ma
didn
t
take
them
cause
they
were
too
well
you
can
just
think
how
we
didn
t
dare
breathe
for
fear
they
wouldn
t
but
they
did
cried
phronsie
greatly
excited
my
dear
beebe
made
them
fit
me
he
yes
said
ben
drawing
a
long
breath
on
the
shoe
went
just
as
nice
and
he
buttoned
it
up
as
snug
as
could
be
and
he
said
but
perhaps
you
ll
object
to
em
cause
they
re
just
think
of
that
the
whitney
boys
screamed
right
out
at
this
stage
of
affairs
and
even
jasper
shared
in
the
general
excitement
until
phronsie
s
shoes
seemed
to
be
the
same
little
specks
of
color
before
their
eyes
as
when
she
danced
around
the
old
kitchen
to
show
them
to
pepper
well
now
said
old
king
at
last
in
a
lull
we
must
let
polly
tell
the
rest
of
it
go
on
polly
my
girl
what
next
well
then
phronsie
had
to
get
off
from
the
little
wooden
chair
old
beebe
made
her
sit
down
in
and
stamp
in
the
shoes
real
hard
to
see
if
they
really
were
a
good
fit
and
then
i
paid
him
out
of
the
money
in
mamsie
s
purse
and
he
rolled
up
the
old
ones
in
a
newspaper
and
then
he
gave
her
don
t
you
think
the
most
oh
you
can
t
think
it
shone
just
like
silver
and
and
was
it
silver
demanded
van
who
seeing
the
story
on
the
wane
was
jealous
of
every
bit
of
statistic
by
which
to
spin
it
out
was
it
really
silver
polly
pepper
sh
be
still
van
said
jasper
with
a
little
nudge
polly
can
not
possibly
get
on
if
you
interrupt
her
all
the
no
it
wasn
t
really
and
truly
silver
said
polly
with
a
bright
smile
for
jasper
but
it
was
just
as
good
oh
and
then
dear
old
beebe
gave
us
another
doughnut
apiece
out
of
the
big
stone
pot
and
then
we
came
out
of
the
shop
and
climbed
into
the
old
green
wagon
and
drove
and
i
had
my
new
shoes
on
grandpapa
announced
phronsie
turning
to
the
old
gentleman
as
if
a
wholly
new
fact
were
to
be
stated
and
they
were
they
were
yes
she
kept
sticking
her
feet
out
from
under
the
shawl
mamsie
had
told
me
to
tuck
her
up
in
every
minute
to
be
sure
the
shoes
were
really
there
laughed
polly
oh
dear
such
a
time
as
i
had
to
get
her
home
and
it
was
most
night
she
stuck
them
out
just
like
this
declared
joel
running
out
his
feet
spasmodically
regardless
of
his
neighbors
look
out
joe
said
ben
and
keep
your
feet
to
yourself
goodness
me
there
s
some
difference
between
them
and
phronsie
i
think
she
put
them
out
like
this
said
little
davie
making
gentle
thrusts
with
his
shoes
and
she
didn
t
knock
folks
well
i
don
t
care
declared
joel
pulling
in
his
feet
as
suddenly
as
he
had
sent
them
out
the
doughnuts
were
good
anyway
veering
off
to
safe
ground
so
they
were
said
ben
smacking
his
lips
and
it
was
nice
to
get
home
to
mother
said
polly
with
dancing
eyes
and
she
had
two
candles
lighted
in
the
kitchen
i
don
t
know
when
we
d
had
more
than
one
at
a
time
before
and
she
said
she
couldn
t
have
done
better
about
phronsie
s
shoes
if
she
had
gone
herself
i
always
remembered
that
and
polly
turned
a
beaming
face
over
at
mother
pepper
busy
darning
the
whitney
boys
stockings
pepper
looked
up
and
sent
her
a
bright
smile
in
return
and
phronsie
said
she
was
going
to
take
her
shoes
to
bed
with
ha
ha
laughed
the
whitney
boys
jasper
tried
to
pull
all
the
three
jackets
but
only
succeeded
in
reaching
van
who
was
nearest
be
still
can
t
you
he
said
under
his
breath
with
a
glance
at
phronsie
sitting
and
radiant
in
grandpapa
s
lap
yes
said
polly
dashing
on
quickly
and
what
do
you
think
i
saw
when
i
went
to
bed
with
mamsie
what
what
cried
the
boys
why
phronsie
in
the
one
shoe
was
held
tightly
in
her
well
hand
but
the
other
she
couldn
t
hold
it
very
well
you
know
because
of
the
cut
thumb
and
there
it
was
tumbled
right
down
over
her
illustration
and
there
was
the
shoe
tumbled
right
over
her
nose
xviii

old
gray
goose

cried
van
in
a
loud
vindictive
voice
now
polly
pepper
you
did
just
as
true
as
well
she
didn
t
promise
she
d

now
said
jasper
you
two
boys
would
tire
her
to
death
if
you
had
your
way
polly
i
wouldn
t
oblige
them
they
re
perfect
well
she
did
promise
repeated
van
positively
and
shaking
his
brown
head
and
when
she
says
she
ll
do
anything
polly
pepper
always
does
it
he
brought
up
triumphantly
yes
i
did
promise
them
jasper
said
polly
stifling
a
sigh
as
she
thought
of
the
hole
in
her
time
that
the
story
would
cut
so
i
ll
do
it
oh
goody
exclaimed
percy
who
had
kept
still
through
fear
of
not
standing
well
in
jasper
s
eyes
van
turned
a
somersault
in
the
middle
of
the
library
floor
and
came
up
bright
and
smiling
but
speechless
let
her
off
boys
begged
jasper
seeing
polly
s
face
she
ll
tell
you
just
as
good
a
one
some
other
no
no
howled
van
in
alarm
it
s
got
to
be
now
you
said
so
polly
this
very
morning
at
breakfast
that

tell
it
just
as
soon
as
you
got
through
with
your
so
there
and
so
i
will
vanny
said
polly
brightly
i
m
going
to
begin
it
this
very
minute
that
is
as
soon
as
you
ve
called
joel
and
david
and
phronsie
and
ben
we
couldn
t
ever
in
all
this
world
have
a
story
without
we
might
without
joel
said
van
making
lively
progress
toward
the
door
having
certain
reasons
of
his
own
for
a
cooling
off
toward
that
individual
since
the
contest
in
strength
with
the
fists
of
the
little
country
lad
for
shame
cried
jasper
after
him
we
all
want
van
doesn
t
like
joel
since
joe
beat
him
said
percy
pleasantly
who
dearly
loved
to
take
van
down
well
i
could
have
beat
him
as
easy
as
not
shouted
back
van
rushing
out
into
the
hall
with
a
very
red
face
to
execute
his
errand
but
he
was
company
and
i
didn
t
want
to
hit
ha
ha
laughed
percy
in
derision
and
doubling
up
in
amusement
polly
stood
quite
still
and
looked
at
him
long
and
intently
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
no
one
had
ever
talked
so
in
the
little
brown
house
and
over
her
came
at
this
moment
an
intense
longing
to
be
back
in
the
dear
old
kitchen
where
all
was
bright
and
cheery
and
sunny
percy
being
unable
to
get
away
from
her
gaze
grew
very
red
and
uncomfortable
at
last
he
said
van
is
such
a
nuisance
as
he
fidgeted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
still
polly
didn
t
say
anything
and
he
s
always
boasting
of
what
he
can
percy
now
was
in
such
distress
that
he
had
no
more
words
at
his
command
and
he
looked
ready
to
cry
as
he
stood
helplessly
before
her
but
there
was
no
chance
for
polly
to
say
anything
for
in
burst
joel
and
david
with
phronsie
flying
along
in
the
rear
van
having
gone
to
look
up
ben
both
of
them
presently
making
their
appearance
now
that
s
good
of
you
polly
said
ben
beaming
at
her
for
it
s
raining
so
dismally
it
s
just
the
thing
to
have
a
so
that
polly
felt
quite
cheered
and
glad
already
that
she
was
to
tell
the
story
isn
t
it
cried
van
quite
importantly
well
i
made
percy
made
a
movement
involuntarily
as
if
he
were
about
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
went
to
the
outside
of
the
group
and
sat
down
quietly
on
the
corner
of
the
sofa
the
others
drawing
up
chairs
and
crickets
to
a
circle
around
polly
well
said
polly
with
a
flourish
then
she
looked
over
and
saw
percy
oh
come
over
here
she
cried
to
him
here
jasper
let
percy
sit
next
so
jasper
moved
away
from
polly
s
side
and
pretty
soon
percy
dragging
up
a
chair
was
sitting
close
to
polly
and
she
was
smiling
down
at
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
now
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
about
the
old
gray
goose
she
began
but
a
shout
interrupted
her
oh
that
s
fine
cried
van
when
the
noise
died
away
because
it
rains
just
about
as
badly
as
it
did
on
that
november
day
when
the
black
chicken
ran
away
and
spoiled
our
thanksgiving
pie
said
polly
with
warm
little
thrills
at
her
heart
to
see
the
happy
faces
before
her
so
you
see
it
s
just
the
time
to
have
the
do
begin
urged
percy
unable
to
keep
still
longer
well
the
old
gray
goose
had
lived
with
us
you
know
ever
since
i
could
remember
ran
on
polly
so
she
was
awfully
tough
why
we
never
thought
of
killing
her
to
eat
but
you
did
cried
little
dick
with
big
eyes
you
said
so
polly
illustration
you
said
so
polly
pepper
cried
little
dick
with
big
eyes
dear
me
yes
said
polly
bobbing
her
brown
head
but
that
was
afterward
when
we
had
to
but
before
the
black
chicken
ran
away
why
no
one
ever
in
all
this
world
thought
of
killing
that
old
gray
goose
to
eat
well
she
was
so
old
and
tough
and
she
had
grown
cross
and
one
day
she
bit
sally
tell
about
it
polly
do
begged
van
percy
so
far
forgetting
all
unpleasantness
that
he
begged
eagerly
too
yes
said
polly
i
am
going
to
well
you
know
sally
brown
was
deacon
brown
s
daughter
and
she
lived
in
did
her
father
let
you
take
the
big
green
wagon
when
phronsie
had
her
new
shoes
asked
van
abruptly
yes
he
oh
i
do
so
wish
we
had
a
deacon
brown
who
would
let
us
have
a
big
green
wagon
and
go
off
to
places
said
percy
enviously
well
twouldn
t
be
badgertown
i
can
tell
you
that
said
joel
swelling
up
importantly
delighted
to
see
percy
s
face
no
you
needn
t
expect
to
have
such
good
times
as
the
peppers
had
in
their
little
brown
house
said
jasper
decidedly
because
you
can
t
no
matter
where
you
are
i
know
for
i
ve
been
jappy
always
feels
so
big
said
van
irritably
because
he
s
seen
the
little
brown
house
well
do
go
on
polly
he
added
quickly
so
i
will
said
polly
with
a
merry
laugh
if
you
boys
will
let
me
but
you
interrupt
me
so
all
the
while
that
sometimes
i
don
t
know
where
i
i
should
think
so
too
said
jasper
polly
i
wouldn
t
tell
them
another
thing
unless
they
d
promise
to
keep
thereupon
such
an
alarm
lest
polly
should
stop
altogether
seized
the
group
that
everybody
kept
still
as
polly
ran
on
well
you
see
sally
brown
lived
in
a
big
red
house
her
father
was
awfully
rich
and
he
had
two
barns
oh
and
a
big
henhouse
and
a
great
pen
where
the
pigs
were
at
this
there
was
every
appearance
of
an
outbreak
but
a
glance
at
jasper
made
them
clap
their
hands
over
their
mouths
yes
oh
and
there
were
cows
and
sometimes
cunning
little
calves
and
everything
just
nice
and
splendid
at
deacon
brown
s
till
you
couldn
t
think
of
anything
he
didn
t
have
why
they
had
milk
every
single
day
to
drink
the
brown
children
had
well
one
day
sally
brown
s
mother
sent
her
to
our
house
to
ask
mamsie
to
come
over
to
help
brown
to
make
soft
exclaimed
both
whitney
boys
together
but
jasper
shot
them
such
a
keen
glance
from
his
dark
eyes
that
they
both
ducked
simultaneously
without
another
word
yes
said
polly
hurrying
on
you
see
mamsie
was
always
so
very
glad
whenever
anybody
wanted
help
about
anything
because
we
were
very
poor
you
know
and
the
money
got
us
some
indian
meal
and
oh
said
the
boys
well
sally
brown
says
she
ran
across
the
meadows
you
see
deacon
brown
s
house
was
off
on
the
road
to
cherry
brook
and
so
whenever
we
went
to
the
brown
s
or
they
came
over
to
see
us
that
is
we
children
why
we
would
run
cross
lots
and
what
s
cross
lots
broke
in
van
ha
ha
don
t
know
what
cross
lots
is
laughed
joel
heartily
for
shame
joe
said
ben
and
why
joey
how
could
they
know
what
tis
to
run
cross
lots
when
they
ve
never
lived
in
the
country
said
polly
well
cross
lots
is
just
prime
exclaimed
joel
lustily
it
s
to
jump
and
race
and
tear
and
holler
over
the
grass
and
the
corn
and
through
folks
orchards
and
over
the
stone
walls
lickety
split
he
jumped
up
and
began
prancing
through
an
imaginary
race
down
the
long
apartment
steering
clear
of
the
oaken
furniture
and
damask
furnishings
with
a
keen
eye
for
the
distance
come
on
dave
he
shouted
over
his
shoulder
let
s
show
them
what
it
s
like
while
the
whitney
boys
sat
transfixed
with
longing
at
every
step
no
you
don
t
joe
commanded
ben
sharply
in
the
house
stop
this
minute
and
little
davie
said
quietly
we
ought
to
wait
till
we
get
well
come
on
out
now
then
cried
joel
whirling
around
in
his
tracks
and
looking
like
a
held
up
against
his
will
why
polly
s
telling
about
how
our
old
gray
goose
bit
sally
brown
said
david
getting
closer
to
polly
we
can
t
now
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
sally
brown
grumbled
joel
very
much
out
of
sorts
and
i
wish
the
old
gray
goose
had
bit
her
worse
i
o
joey
reproved
polly
think
how
good
deacon
brown
was
to
us
and
brown
well
sally
wasn
t
said
joel
shamefacedly
digging
his
toes
into
the
soft
carpet
she
bit
me
once
and
scratched
my
well
then
i
suppose
you
were
bad
to
her
said
ben
coolly
so
come
back
joe
and
don
t
interrupt
this
story
again
besides
it
s
raining
like
well
we
can
go
on
the
veranda
said
joel
but
he
came
reluctantly
back
and
sat
down
again
well
so
sally
ran
cross
lots
said
polly
picking
up
the
narrative
again
she
told
us
all
about
it
you
know
and
she
says
she
never
saw
the
old
gray
goose
till
just
as
she
ran
into
the
lane
down
by
grandma
bascom
s
and
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
hiss
exclaimed
polly
suddenly
stretching
up
her
neck
as
much
like
a
goose
as
possible
so
that
every
one
of
her
auditors
jumped
and
the
whitney
boys
looked
at
the
door
involuntarily
as
if
expecting
to
see
an
old
gray
goose
walking
in
at
which
they
all
laughed
right
merrily
so
that
old
king
popped
his
head
in
the
door
to
see
what
it
all
meant
sally
brown
is
biting
the
old
gray
goose
piped
out
phronsie
flying
to
him
at
which
they
all
laughed
worse
than
ever
so
that
it
really
seemed
as
if
polly
never
would
finish
that
story
in
the
world
illustration
sally
brown
and
the
old
gray
goose
at
last
everything
quieted
down
and
polly
was
under
way
again
in
the
midst
of
the
narration
so
just
as
she
turned
into
the
lane
down
by
grandma
bascom
s
hiss
came
something
after
her
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
our
old
gray
goose
running
on
its
sticks
of
legs
as
fast
as
it
could
with
its
long
neck
stuck
out
straight
at
her
and
screaming
and
hissing
like
everything
oh
dear
me
and
sally
was
so
frightened
she
couldn
t
run
another
step
and
so
she
just
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
covered
up
her
eyes
with
her
two
she
always
was
a
silly
declared
joel
in
scorn
why
didn
t
she
just
turn
and
stare
at
that
old
goose
that
s
the
way
i
d
done
and
then
says
i
i
d
taken
a
stick
and
run
after
her
and
whacked
her
over
the
and
what
did
the
old
gray
goose
do
then
demanded
van
whitney
with
one
ear
out
for
what
joel
would
have
done
why
that
dreadful
old
bird
just
climbed
up
into
sally
brown
s
lap
and
nipped
a
little
bit
of
her
arm
into
her
bill
and
bit
it
and
sally
squealed
perfectly
awfully
and
grandma
bascom
heard
her
and
she
came
out
of
her
door
and
shook
her
broom
at
the
old
gray
goose
so
then
she
went
away
who
did
sally
asked
percy
with
a
puzzled
air
no
the
old
gray
goose
did
said
polly
she
took
her
sticks
of
legs
out

of

and

arm
with
opodeldoc
said
polly
glad
she
could
do
so
well
with
the
long
word
what
s
opodel
and
the
rest
of
it
polly
asked
percy
who

always
uncomfortable
if
he
couldn
t
get
the
smallest
detail
of
a
story
oh
i
don
t

said
polly
wishing
very
much
that

had
learned
all
about

so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
now
it
s
green
stuff
like

and

grandma
bascom
gave
us
that

suppose
we
didn
t
have
any
opodeldoc
in
the
house
that
day
but
sometimes
mamsie
would
have
wormwood
too
because
we
used
to
get
hurt
some
of
us
pretty
often
of
course
and
we
had
to
be
tied
up
you
know

cross
lots

the
green
umbrella
polly
was
at
her
wits
end
to
think
of
anything
to
make
a
story
out
of
she
was
longing
to
run
out
into
the
conservatory
and
be
with
turner
in
his
work
among
the
flowers
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
feet
must
carry
her
off
in
spite
of
herself
but
there
were
all
four
of
the
boys
standing
in
a
row
before
her
and
phronsie
s
little
face
expectantly
lifted
waiting
for
polly
to
begin
oh
dear
me
she
exclaimed
with
an
impatient
little
flounce
i
do
wish
is
that
the
story

asked
phronsie
wonderingly
no
it
isn
t
said
van
and
i
don
t
believe
she
means
to

the
faces
all
fell
dismally
at
that
don
t
you
polly
asked
phronsie
anxiously
well

polly
began
half
ashamed
of
her
ill
humor

declared
joel
scanning
polly
s
face
closely
she
s
going
off
somewhere
maybe
with
ben
and
she
won
t
tell
us
where
i
m
going
to
tag
oh

joe
said
polly
quickly
i
was
going
into
the
conservatory
to
help
turner
work
over
the
oh
bother
that
old
conservatory
exclaimed
joel
who
was
always
lost
in
wonder
over
polly
s
love
for
flowers
it
s
mean
not
to
stay
and
tell
us
a
story
he
added
in
a
dudgeon
we
haven
t
heard
one
for
ever
so
polly
wants
to
work
over
the
flowers
said
phronsie
yet
she
looked
very
grave
as
she
said
it
yes
i
do
said
polly
and
she
turned
back
and
regarded
the
little
group
of
boys
most
decidedly
and
i
m
tired
to
death
telling
you
children
stories
i
want
to
have
a
nice
time
once
in
a
while
myself
and
a
little
red
spot
began
to
come
on
each
cheek
the
boys
all
stared
at
her
without
a
word
and
phronsie
crept
nearer
and
put
her
little
hand
against
polly
s
dress
and
you
tease
and
tease
the
life
out
of
me
cried
polly
who
now
that
she
had
begun
found
it
impossible
to
stop
herself
and
i
wish
you
d
go
away
and
let
me
and
there
stood
mother
pepper
how
she
got
there
no
one
ever
knew
but
there
she
was
in
the
doorway
polly
said
pepper
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
black
eyes
that
made
polly
s
brown
ones
droop
you
needn
t
tell
any
story
just
illustration
polly
said
pepper
you
needn
t
tell
any
story
just
o
mamsie
cried
polly
all
the
color
gone
from
her
cheek
and
bursting
into
a
torrent
of
tears
she
rushed
to
mother
pepper
s
side
please
let
me
oh

i
d
rather
tell
a
story
than

anything
else
i
would
oh

t

screamed
joel
breaking
away
from
the
others
to
precipitate
himself
into
pepper
s
arms
his
face
working
frightfully
in
his
efforts
not
to
cry
the
other
boys
stood
helplessly
by
lost
in
astonishment
no
polly
said
pepper
firmly
not
now
the
story
must
wait
and
now
children
you
can
go
away
and
shut
the
can
i
stay
begged
phronsie
two
tears
rolling
down
her
round
cheeks
as
she
came
up
and
stood
imploringly
by
mother
pepper
s
side
no
so
phronsie
crept
off
like
a
hurt
little
thing
after
the
others
and
carefully
shut
the
door
then
they
all
sat
down
on
the
lowest
stairs
to
think
about
it
was
that
really
polly
pepper
asked
van
in
an
whisper
after
a
long
silence
who
did
you
think
it
could
be
if
it
wasn
t
polly
demanded
percy
crossly
and
turning
on
him
some
old
witch
dressed
up
in
polly
s
clothes
said
van
stoutly
little
davie
laid
his
head
down
on
the
stair
above
him
nobody
could
get
into
pol
polly
s
clothes
he
sobbed
convulsively
of
course
not
said
percy
gloomily
it
s
only
because
van
is
such
a
silly
that
he
says
and
if
you
say
that
again
about
an
old
witch
getting
our
polly
s
clothes
i
ll

you
cried
joel
with
a
very
red
face
and
doubling
up
his
stout
little
fists
he
made
a
lunge
at
van
van
pretended
not
to
be
afraid
but
managed
to
get
on
the
other
side
of
percy
oh

wailed
david
steadily
and
you
ve
made
dave
cry
cried
joel
and
i
ll
pound
and
bang
you
for
this
time
he
managed
to
reach
van
but
in
the
same
moment
exclaimed
a
voice
above
them
and
there
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
looking
down
at
them
was
grandpapa
what
are
you
all
doing
he
asked
regarding
them
fixedly
we
re
just
sitting
here
said
percy
who
was
the
only
one
to
find
his
tongue
and
looking
up
sidewise
so
i
perceive
said
the
old
gentleman
joel
was
pitching
into
van
grandpapa
cried
little
dick
in
the
most
cheerful
of
tones
and
scrambling
at
a
very
rapid
rate
and
polly
ugh
screamed
joel
after
him
don
t
let
him
tell
grandpapa
he
begged
bounding
over
the
steps
to
rush
past
dick
and
reach
the
old
gentleman
s
side
first
you
pushed
me
cried
little
dick
savagely
and
coming
up
and
shining
he
pushed
me
grandpapa
and
he
doubled
up
his
fists
at
joel
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
again
you
mustn
t
be
so
free
with
your
fists
my
it

said
joel
i
was
going
to
pitch

van
don

grandpapa
he
begged
anxiously
polly
said
began
dick
but
joel
clapped
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
there
were
the
two
boys
whirling
round
and
round
the
old
gentleman
in
the
centre
looking
at
them
helplessly
meantime
phronsie
had
come
over
the
stairs
to
put
her
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
s
please
stop
them
grandpapa
she
begged
piteously
goodness
me
dear
exclaimed
king
there
there
phronsie
child
don
t
at
the
word
cry
joel
s
hand
fell
helplessly
down
from
dick
s
mouth
and
he
stood
quite
still
while
little
dick
slid
out
from
under
his
arm
triumphantly
if
you
do
speak
you
ll
be
a
mean
little
beggar
dick
whitney
cried
van
flying
over
the
stairs
and
polly
pepper
won
t
ever
tell
you
a
story
in
all
this
world
at
these
words
dick
closed
his
mouth
and
concluded
not
to
say
what
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
i
was
just
as
bad
as
joel
grandpapa
went
on
van
crowding
up
to
the
old
gentleman
s
side
for
i
said
bad
things
about
ugh
exclaimed
joel
turning
on
him
suddenly
don
t
let
him
tell
grandpapa
make
him
phronsie
said
old
king
turning
to
her
very
much
puzzled
i
can
t
make
anything
out
of
these
boys
they
re
in
a
bad
way
you
come
with
me
child
and
he
seized
her
little
hand
and
moved
a
step
or
two
away
but
phronsie
gently
pulled
him
back
i
think
i
ought
to
stay
here
grandpapa
she
said
regarding
the
boys
gravely
while
the
tears
went
slowly
over
her
round
cheeks
nonsense
child
you
can
t
do
them
any
good
if
they
want
to
pound
each
other
s
heads
they
ll
do
it
and
i
think
myself
it
might
be
a
good
dose
for
them
but
they
ought
not
to
grandpapa
said
phronsie
in
distress
polly
wouldn
t
like
at
mention
of
polly
s
name
joel
left
pursuit
of
van
and
plunged
up
to
old
king
i
won
t
touch
either
of
them
he
cried
i
don
t
care
if
they
pound
me
i
ll
let
and
i
m
not
going
to
pound
him
declared
van
with
a
positive
air
i
am
announced
little
dick
magnificently
i
shall
knock
joel
flat
and
he
beat
the
air
with
his
fists
at
this
old
king
burst
into
such
a
laugh
in
which
percy
and
van
and
joel
joined
that
the
tears
forgot
to
roll
down
phronsie
s
cheeks
and
david
got
off
from
the
lowest
stair
and
came
up
to
add
himself
to
the
group
well
now
said
grandpapa
cheerfully
seeing
everything
is
so
nice
and
comfortable
you
would
all
do
well
to
come
into
my
room
and
see
what
i
ve
got
for
you
put
up
your
fists
in
your
pocket
dickybird
and
save
them
for
next
with
that
he
marched
the
whole
bunch
of
children
before
him
into
his
own
and
there
behind
the
table
and
waiting
for
them
was
polly
pepper
the
children
all
stared
at
her
a
moment
then
phronsie
piped
out
rushing
tumultuously
over
behind
the
table
to
get
into
polly
s
lap
it
is
polly
she
s
got
yes
polly
has
got
back
said
the
old
gentleman
now
polly
before
any
one
had
a
chance
to
say
a
word
i
think
you
would
better
set
right
to
work
about
that
and
he
bustled
about
in
such
a
lively
manner
getting
everybody
into
chairs
that
almost
before
the
children
knew
it
there
was
polly
in
the
very
midst
of
the
green
umbrella
and
it
began
like
this
ever
and
ever
so
many
years
ago
said
polly
there
was
a
queer
little
man
and
he
lived
in
the
middle
of
a
big
city
in
a
perfectly
funny
little
house
with
only
one
window
in
it
besides
the
door
and
he
had
a
little
daughter
she
was
only
so
high
polly
put
her
hands
up
above
the
a
little
way
and
she
could
speak
different
o
polly
exclaimed
old
king
under
his
breath
and
there
wasn
t
anything
that
would
make
music
that
she
couldn
t
play
on
said
polly
so
they
didn
t
have
to
have
the
stop
in
front
of
the
house
the
queer
little
old
man
used
to
climb
up
the
tree
in
front
of
the
perfectly
funny
little
house
and
if
he
saw
a
man
coming
along
he
would
scream
out
go
right
away
my
daughter
makes
all
the
music
i
illustration
go
right
away
my
daughter
makes
all
the
music
i
even
if
there
was
a
monkey
with
him
asked
joel
breaking
in
yes
even
if
there
was
a
monkey
said
polly
that
made
no
difference
he
made
him
go
away
all
the
same
well
and
then
down
the
queer
little
man
would
slide
along
the
tree
till
he
got
to
the
ground
and
then
he
would
rush
into
the
house
in
a
great
state
and
he
would
cry
out
come
my
daughter
and
play
me
a
tune
and
then
he
would
begin
to
dance
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
he
would
spin
until
his
feet
were
all
twinkling
in
and
out
underneath
his
coat
for
i
must
tell
you
that
he
wore
a
long
coat
that
flapped
around
his
heels
every
step
he
ha
ha
laughed
joel
in
which
the
others
joined
polly
smiling
at
them
to
see
their
brightness
restored
well
and
there
he
would
keep
araminta
sophia
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
her
name
playing
away
till
she
almost
tumbled
down
she
was
so
tired
and
at
last
when
he
had
danced
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
he
said
now
take
the
green
umbrella
and
go
out
and
buy
me
some
fish
for
so
araminta
sophia
hopped
up
from
the
and
ran
out
into
the
shed
that
was
tacked
onto
the
perfectly
funny
little
house
and
there
hanging
on
a
gold
peg
was
the
green
real
gold
polly
pepper
cried
van
yes
said
polly
real
true
gold
and
it
was
oh
so
big
you
can
t
think
and
ever
so
thick
through
well
and
on
it
dangled
the
green
umbrella
for
that
was
the
place
where
it
always
had
to
be
kept
whenever
araminta
sophia
brought
it
home
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
happened
if
she
hadn
t
hung
it
up
didn
t
anybody
ever
carry
it
but
araminta
sophia
asked
percy
dear
me
no
said
polly
for
if
they
should
it
would
run
away
with
oh
make
the
queer
old
man
carry
it
and
have
it
run
away
with
him
screamed
joel
do
no
no
said
old
king
seeing
polly
hesitate
i
sha
n
t
have
any
such
work
as
that
this
story
is
begun
and
i
m
going
to
hear
the
rest
about
araminta
sophia
go
on
polly
my
and
some
other
day
i
ll
tell
you
how
the
queer
old
man
did
carry
the
green
umbrella
and
it
did
run
away
with
him
said
polly
with
a
bright
smile
for
all
well
so
araminta
sophia
took
down
the
green
umbrella
from
its
golden
peg
and
then
she
hung
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
to
bring
the
fish
home
in
and
off
she
started
as
nice
as
you
please
and
just
as
soon
as
she
got
outside
the
door
of
the
perfectly
funny
little
house
all
the
birds
in
the
tree
that
hung
over
it
and
in
the
trees
all
around
whispered
to
each
other
and
piped
and
trilled
and
sang
it
over
and
over
here
comes
the
green
umbrella
here
comes
the
green
umbrella
what
did
they
all
say
that
for
asked
joel
oh
you
ll
hear
answered
polly
if
you
wait
well
that
is
just
what
all
the
birds
did
say
they
always
said
it
whenever
they
saw
araminta
sophia
come
out
under
the
green
umbrella
you
see
if
she
hadn
t
got
it
all
the
birds
would
have
flown
at
her
and
jumped
down
on
her
head
and
made
a
nest
in
her
oh
dear
me
cried
all
the
boys
together
and
so
she
had
to
take
it
every
single
time
she
went
out
to
walk
said
polly
decidedly
else
it
would
have
been
perfectly
dreadful
well
off
she
went
with
the
little
basket
that
she
was
to
bring
the
fish
home
in
hanging
on
her
arm
when
as
she
turned
a
sudden
corner
an
old
woman
with
a
big
brown
cloak
on
and
her
face
all
hidden
in
the
back
of
a
big
hood
stepped
up
to
her
and
said
pretty
little
lady
what
have
you
there
now
araminta
sophia
had
always
been
told
by
her
father
the
queer
little
man
not
to
talk
to
strangers
and
she
was
going
right
on
under
her
green
umbrella
when
the
old
woman
said
again
pretty
little
lady
how
your
eyes
shine
what
have

araminta
sophia
stopping
just
a
moment
and
before
she
could
say
another
word
the
old
woman
put
her
hand
under
her
long
brown
cloak
and
drawing
it
out
she
bent
over
the
little
basket
look

the
old
woman
what

it
shouted
joel
and
the
others
demanding
to
know
the
same
thing
old
king
s
was
presently
the
scene
of
great
confusion
when
it
cleared
away
polly
was
saying
and
so
araminta
sophia
peered
into
the
basket
and
the
more
she
looked
she
couldn
t
see
anything
and
so
she
said
pretty
soon

minute
stupid
creature
said
the
old
woman
i

it
for
now
araminta
sophia
wanted
dreadfully
the
beautiful
gift
the
old
woman
had
put
in
the
basket
hold
the
umbrella
carefully
over
my
head
she
said
giving
it
into
the
skinny
hand
and
in
a
minute
as
soon
as
the
words
had
left
her
mouth
away
flew
the
old
woman
the
green
umbrella
and
all
into
the
oh

howled
all
the
boys
together
phronsie
snuggled
down
into
polly
s
lap
and
held
tightly
to
her
pretty
creature
with
the
shining
eyes

out
for
the
birds
screamed
the
old
woman
in
the
brown
cloak
mounting
the
sky
and
holding
the
green
umbrella
tightly
in
her
skinny
hands
and
then
she
laughed
a
dreadful
laugh
and
araminta
sophia
sat
down
on
a
big
stone
by
the
roadside
and
put
her
face
in
her
two
hands
and
cried
as
hard
as
she
oh
dear
me
said
the
boys
again
while
phronsie
gave
a
long
sigh
and
crept
within
polly
s
arms
closer
than
ever
don
t
feel
badly
said
polly
but
wait
and
see
if
perfectly
splendid
times

t
come
to
araminta
sophia
well
there
she
sat
crying
away
on
her
stone
her
little
basket
dangling
on
her
arm
and
the
birds
flying
about
her
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
old
woman
mount
up
to
the
sky
carrying
the
green
umbrella
every
single
bird
screamed
right
out
oh
come
the
green
umbrella
s
gone
the
green
umbrella
s
gone
and
they
all
hopped
down
on
araminta
sophia
s
head
till
you
couldn
t
see
anything
but
a
heap
of
birds
and
oh
dear
me
cried
all
the
boys
again
and
do
make
somebody
come
out
and
shoot
them
cried
joel
in
great
excitement
wait
and
see
said
polly
merrily
well
when
araminta
sophia
felt
all
the
birds
hopping
down
on
her
head
she
spoke
up
very
humbly
oh
if
you
please
little
birds
i
should
like
to
have
you
get
off
from
my
we
can
t
said
one
of
the
birds
peering
at
her
with
one
eye
for
the
old
woman
that
has
gone
up
into
the
sky
won
t
let
she
s
a

old
woman
shouted
joel
vindictively
make
something
come
and
eat
her
please

from
my
head
begged
araminta
sophia
and
we
can
t
because
the
old
woman
up
in
the
sky
won
t
let
us
the
birds
kept
saying
when
suddenly
when
no
one
was
looking
along
came
a
man
with
a
big
gun
over
his
shoulder
ah
ha
he
said
now
i
ll
have
those
goody
cried
joel
slapping
his
hands
together
smartly
oh

aramin
what

phronsie
araminta
sophia
no

she
s
not
to

promised
polly
patting
phronsie
s
yellow
hair
well
up
went
the
man
s
big
gun
and
bang
bang
every
single
bird
fell
dead
to
the
it
was
impossible
to
describe
the
excitement
now
and
polly
felt
warm
little
thrills
at
her
heart
to
see
it
all
and
don
t
you
think
boys
and
phronsie
she
ran
on
gayly
that
the
old
woman
in
the
brown
cloak
who
had
mounted
the
sky
carrying
the
green
umbrella
peered
down
from
under
it
and
when
she
saw
what
was
going
on
she
was
very
angry
and
she
cried
great
big
tears
and
she
couldn
t
stop
but
kept
crying
and
crying
and
the
tears
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
they
fell
all
over
her
skinny
hands
and
washed
the
handle
of
the
green
umbrella
out
of
them
for
the
tears
fell
over
them
so
fast
she
couldn
t
hold
it
you
know
and
so
away
it
fell
down
to
earth
again
down
down
till
it
came
right
on
top
of
araminta
sophia
s
and
ara
what
is
it
polly
cried
phronsie
greatly
excited
got
her
green
umbrella
again
didn
t
she
polly
yes
said
polly
nodding
her
head
briskly
there
it
was
just
as
good
as
ever
so
araminta
sophia
jumped
up
and
was
just
going
off
with
her
little
basket
she
was
to
bring
home
the
fish
in
and
carrying
the
green
umbrella
over
her
head
when
the
man
with
the
big
gun
said
stay
so
araminta
sophia
stopped
right
straight
off
where
she
was
is
that
old
woman
in
a
brown
cloak
any
relation
of
yours
for
the
old
woman
was
coming
down
from
the
sky
and
they
could
just
see
her
cloak
oh
no
said
araminta
sophia
looking
out
from
under
her
green
umbrella
and
getting
up
closer
to
the
man
with
the
big
gun
she
ran
off
with
my
green
flew
off
you
mean
said
the
man
you
should
always
say
what
you
mean
child
well
now
old
woman
with
the
brown
cloak
you
have
flown
up
there
and
there
you
must
let
me
come
down
squealed
the
old
woman
angrily
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
me
come
no
indeed
said
the
man
and
he
put
his
big
gun
to
his
shoulder
you
flew
up
there
and
there
you
must
stay
or
i
ll
shoot
your
head
howled
joel
springing
to
his
feet
followed
by
davie
and
the
whitney
boys
this
way
and
he
put
an
imaginary
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
took
aim
at
a
fanciful
old
woman
in
a
brown
cloak
up
in
the
sky
bang
bang
there
you
go
old
woman
and
your
head
s
no
no
he
didn
t
say
so
cried
davie
running
up
to
joel
the
man
with
the
big
gun
said
he
would
shoot
her
head
off
if
she
came
down
i
don
t
care
said
joel
banging
away
i
m
going
to
shoot
her
anyway
she
s
a
horrible
old
woman
and
i
sha
n
t
let
her
come
down
bang
bang
well
that
isn
t
the
way
to
do
it
said
van
twitching
at
the
imaginary
gun
you
don
t
aim
high
and
couldn
t
the
old
woman
come
down
polly
asked
phronsie
a
troubled
look
beginning
to
settle
over
her
face
no
dear
said
polly
there
she
had
to
not
come
down
persisted
phronsie
no
that
is
as
she
looked
at
phronsie
s
face
i
guess
the
man
with
the
big
gun
would
let
her
come
down
once
in
a
while
and
then
araminta
sophia
could
stay
in
the
perfectly
funny
little
house
and
shut
the
door
you
know
so
the
old
woman
couldn
t
let
any
more
birds
get
in
her
hair
and
then
back
she
would
have
to
fly
up
into
the
sky
again
the
old
woman
with
the
brown
cloak
i
mean
for
the
man
with
the
big
gun
said
if
she
didn
t
he
should
know
it
and
he
would
come
and
shoot
her
head
polly
said
phronsie
laying
her
cheek
against
polly
s
rosy
one
i
am
so
very
glad
you
let
that
old
woman
come
down
sometimes
because
maybe
she
had
a
little
girl
and
she
wanted
to
see
her
i
am
so
glad
xx
the
green
umbrella
and
the
queer
little
man
come
on
shouted
van
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
polly
pepper
is
going
to
tell
the
story
of
the
green
umbrella
and
the
queer
little
come
on
and
in
two
minutes
the
bunch
of
the
youngest
peppers
with
percy
and
little
dick
precipitated
themselves
over
the
stairs
and
raced
along
at
his
heels
until
they
all
brought
up
in
jasper
s
den
now
that
s
fine
exclaimed
jasper
jumping
out
of
his
chair
behind
the
as
they
all
plunged
in
van
having
made
the
appointment
in
advance
but
where
s
polly
oh
she
s
coming
cried
van
rushing
around
and
tumbling
over
everybody
else
in
his
eagerness
to
draw
up
the
seats
she
s
up
in
ben
s
room
and
they
re
both
coming
in
a
minute
or
two
here
you
fellows
to
percy
and
dick
help
along
with
these
chairs
will
you
percy
who
didn
t
like
to
move
quickly
at
anything
that
was
like
work
slowly
managed
to
draw
up
one
chair
into
which
he
planted
himself
drawing
a
long
sigh
as
he
sat
down
that
s
nice
growled
van
quite
red
in
the
face
from
his
exertions
you
feel
smart
don
t
you
to
leave
us
to
do
all
the
work
as
percy
pretended
not
to
hear
which
so
enraged
van
that
he
ran
up
and
planted
a
smart
rap
on
percy
s
back
as
he
leaned
back
composedly
in
his
chair
do
that
again
will
you
he
cried
whirling
around
to
glare
at
van
i
ll
knock
your
head
off
if
you
here
here
exclaimed
jasper
looking
up
quickly
from
the
corner
where
he
was
piling
away
his
till
it
was
time
to
fly
to
work
on
them
again
you
ll
march
out
of
this
room
if

on
like
that
i
can
tell
you

and
apologize
to
each
other
now
both
of
you
he
s
always
pitching
into
me
cried
percy
his
face
getting
a
lively
red
for
he
hated
above
all
things
to
miss
jasper
s
approval
and
i
m
tired
of
apologize
i
say
commanded
jasper
with
a
bob
of
his
head
that
percy
knew
meant
business
or
out
you
go
while
as
for
you
van
i
don
t
know
but
what
i
much
better
pitch

out
neck
and
heels
as
it
seems
you
begun
oh
i
ll
apologize
i
ll
say
anything
you
want
jappy
cried
van
in
alarm
for
invitations
to
jasper
s
den
didn
t
come
often
enough
to
be
lightly
regarded
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
ran
around
percy
s
chair
and
stuck
out
his
hand
i
m
sorry
but
i
wish
somebody
else
would
pitch
into
you
for
you
re
so
mean
and
hold
on
roared
jasper
at
him
that
s
no
i
don
t
mind
it
said
percy
carelessly
and
he
extended
his
hand
with
a
patronizing
air
that
made
van
furious
and
sent
him
back
to
his
work
over
the
seats
in
anything
but
a
sweet
frame
of
mind
how
polly
pepper
ever
gets
along
with
you
i
don
t
see
said
jasper
in
despair
as
he
retreated
to
his
corner
oh
we
don
t
act
so
before
her
observed
van
pleasantly
pulling
and
pushing
some
refractory
chairs
into
place
well
i
should
be
ashamed
to
act
worse
when
she
is
not
by
retorted
jasper
scornfully
think
how
dreadfully
she
would
feel
to
see
you
chaps
going
on
percy
hung
his
head
and
van
cried
out
in
alarm
oh
don
t
tell
her
jappy
don
t
tell
her
as
if
i
d
want
to
tell
her
exclaimed
jasper
in
greater
scorn
than
ever
meantime
polly
who
had
taken
her
recreation
hour
the
day
before
to
plan
out
this
story
of
the
green
umbrella
and
the
queer
little
man
was
sitting
down
on
the
floor
her
head
in
mother
pepper
s
lap
while
mamsie
s
hands
softly
smoothed
the
brown
hair
i
don
t
see
how
i
came
to
say
it
she
mourned
for
about
the
fortieth
time
the
words
seemed
to
slip
out
mamsie
without
my
saying
them
and
then
i
couldn
t
no
that
is
generally
the
way
observed
mother
pepper
when
any
one
lets
ill
temper
say
the
first
word
to
all
peace
of
mind
so
watch
the
first
word
down
went
polly
s
head
lower
than
ever
in
mother
pepper
s
lap
i
know
you
were
tired
of
telling
stories
to
the
children
went
on
pepper
but
that
s
no
excuse
and
besides
you
had
i
know
it
mumbled
poor
polly
into
mother
pepper
s
stuff
gown
and
if
a
body
is
going
to
do
a
kindness
for
another
it
s
best
to
do
it
cheerfully
remember
that
polly
didn
t
say
anything
and
the
kind
hands
kept
up
their
stroking
of
the
brown
hair
and
the
clock
on
the
shelf
ticked
away
busily
as
much
as
to
say
remember
that
and
now
said
pepper
at
last
quite
cheerily
i
wouldn
t
ever
say
anything
more
about
this
we
ve
talked
it
over
you
and
i
a
good
many
times
and
you
ve
told
king
so
it
s
no
good
to
keep
it
alive
just
do
the
best
you
can
now
polly
only
remember
never
to
let
it
happen
mamsie
exclaimed
polly
lifting
her
head
from
pepper
s
lap
suddenly
and
sitting
quite
straight
on
the
floor
her
brown
eyes
shining
through
her
tears
i
just
hope
there
ll
be
oh
lots
and
lots
to
do
for
those
boys
i
love
to
tell
them
stories
and
i
m
going
to
do
everything
else
i
can
think
of
for
them
there
ll
be
enough
you
can
do
for
them
i
guess
polly
observed
her
mother
wisely
and
that
s
the
better
way
to
show
you
re
sorry
than
talking
about
it
there
here
comes
one
of
them
now
for
you
as
van
bounded
in
holding
out
both
hands
much
as
if
polly
pepper
were
a
parcel
and
he
was
to
bear
her
down
to
the
waiting
group
below
o
polly
we
re
ready
he
began
but
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
interrupted
him
oh
for
the
story
van
all
right
i
ll
go
and
she
ran
to
the
door
but
she
came
flying
back
mamsie
and
she
tried
to
set
a
kiss
on
the
smoothly
banded
black
hair
but
pepper
lifted
her
head
quickly
so
the
soft
little
kiss
dropped
on
the
end
of
her
nose
which
made
them
all
laugh
merrily
here
she
is
cried
van
throwing
open
the
door
of
jasper
s
den
and
handing
polly
pepper
in
with
a
flourish
and
polly
wasn
t
in
ben
s
room
after
all

had
the
greatest
time
to

depths
of
his
comfortable
chair

find

van
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
a
glance
at
jasper
made
him
send
the
words
back
sit
here
polly
jasper
was
saying
conducting
polly
to
the
big
chair
back
of
the
table
o
jasper
that
looks
as
if

was
going
to

a
lecture
laughed
polly

polly
brightly

together
they
piled
the
papers
up
neatly
and
jasper
crammed
the
whole
budget
into
the
then
he
rapped
with
the
the
meeting

when
the
door

and
in

it
at
once
if
you
don
t
stop
talking
and
be
quiet
i
ll
pitch

out
of

he
added
in
his
natural
voice
that

a
great
way
to
address
an
audience
i
should
think
said
ben
in
pretended
indignation

all
the
roomful

in
great
satisfaction

so
here

now
you

araminta
sophia

green
umbrella
all
safely
back
again
when
the

with

by
the
jacket

golden
key
when

on
polly
you

had
to
buy

before

could
go

to
look
at
polly

fish

polly
of
course
i
just

phronsie
shaking
her
head

fish

other
thing

don
t
know
what
you
mean
phronsie
said
polly
looking
around
on
the
group
in
a
puzzled
way
the
other
thing
persisted
phronsie
clambering
down
from
her
chair
to
come
to
polly
s
side
what
the
old
woman
said
she
put
in
oh
said
polly
then
she
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
none
of
you
boys
remembered
to
ask
me
that
and
i
forgot
it
myself
oh
twas
just
her
fingers
phronsie
that
was
whose
fingers
asked
phronsie
very
much
mystified
why
the
long
skinny
ones
that
belonged
to
the
old
woman
said
polly
she
put
them
in
the
basket
and
just
pulled
them
out
but
she
said
she
put
in
a
gift
for
ara
what
did
you
call
her
polly
said
phronsie
araminta
sophia
said
polly
well
she
said
that
because
she
was
a
naughty
old
woman
phronsie
there
wasn
t
any
gift

all
now
go
and
sit
in
your
chair
again
that
s
a
good
girl
then
i
ll
go
on
with
the
so
phronsie
clambered
into
her
chair
and
laid
her
hands
in
her
lap
but
her
mind
was
busy
over
the
naughty
old
woman
and
the
absence
of
the
gift
in
the
little
basket
that
was
to
bring
home
the
fish
well
where
was
i
began
polly
again
oh
i
know
araminta
sophia
was
hanging
up
the
green
umbrella
on
the
golden
hook
when
suddenly
the
door
of
the
shed
opened
wide
and
in
came
her
father
the
queer
little
man
what
a
time
you
have
been
away
daughter
he
squeaked
out
i
couldn
t
help
it
father
said
araminta
sophia
and
then
she
told
him
the
reason
why
and
all
about
it
but
the
queer
little
man
only
said
what
a
tiresome
story
tell
me
some
other
i
don
t
think
that
was
very
polite
began
joel
but
ben
took
another
hold
of
his
jacket
collar
he
was
more
polite
than
you
are
whispered
ben
and
you
needn
t
take
the
trouble
to
hang
up
that
green
umbrella
daughter
said
the
queer
little
old
man
for
i
am
going
out
to
walk
with
it
father
exclaimed
araminta
sophia
turning
pale
with
fright
why
you
ve
never
done
such
a
thing
in
all
your
life
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
around
the
green
umbrella
silly
chit
cried
the
queer
little
old
man
in
a
terrible
passion
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
tell
me
what
to
do
give
me
that
umbrella
this
very
araminta
sophia
tumbled
down
to
her
knees
holding
on
to
the
green
umbrella
and
besought
him
that
he
wouldn
t
take
it
from
her
but
would
let
her
hang
it
in
its
place
on
the
golden
hook
the
man
out
there
with
his
gun
will
shoot
you
at
last
she
said
he
s
most
dreadfully
big
too
which
was
the
very
worst
thing
she
could
have
said
for
the
queer
little
man
always
fancied
that
he
was
as
strong
as
a
lion
and
it
made
him
very
angry
to
hear
of
anybody
bigger
than
he
was
so
now
he
squeaked
out
in
what
he
fancied
was
a
terrible
voice
give
me
that
umbrella
this
instant
or
i
ll
put
you
up
in
the
corner
with
your
face
to
the
after
this
terrible
threat
araminta
sophia
handed
him
the
green
umbrella
without
a
word
and
then
she
tumbled
over
on
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
and
the
old
white
cat
who
caught
all
the
spiders
and
mice
in
the
perfectly
funny
little
house
crept
in
and
licked
her
face
until
she
came
to
and
sat
up
that
was
nice
of
the
old
white
cat
said
phronsie
to
herself
smoothing
down
her
apron
again
in
satisfaction
illustration
phronsie
smoothed
down
her
white
apron
in
satisfaction
but
by
that
time
the
queer
little
old
man
was
gone
and
the
green
umbrella
with
him
at
first
he
walked
along
quite
fiercely
taking
what
he
thought
were
very
big
steps
but
they
were
little
bits
of
mincing
steps
like
show
us
polly
do
begged
van
so
polly
hopped
out
from
her
seat
behind
the
table
and
amid
peals
of
laughter
she
minced
up
and
down
like
a
tiny
queer
little
man
until
she
nearly
tumbled
over
on
her
nose
dear
me
she
exclaimed
as
she
hopped
into
her
seat
again
it
s
perfectly
dreadful
to
be
so
little
well
where
was
i
oh
well
off
he
stepped
holding
up
the
green
umbrella
as
proudly
as
possible
and
wishing
there
was
somebody
to
see
how
nice
he
looked
but
there
wasn
t
only
a
pig
behind
a
fence
looking
out
through
the
holes
and
he
didn
t
care
in
the
least
for
he
was
grunting
for
something
to
eat
so
you
see
the
queer
little
old
man
had
to
go
mincing
and
nipping
on
quite
alone
well
and
before
he
knew
it
he
was
stepping
off
very
briskly
dear
me
how
young
i
feel
he
exclaimed
to
himself
it
all
comes
of
carrying
this
green
umbrella
now
i
mean
to
take
it
out
to
walk
every
and
as
he
finished
the
last
word
he
found
himself
running
this
is
perfectly
splendid
he
cried
joyfully
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
had
such
a
good
run
now
i
ll
enjoy
it
till
i
get
to
that
tree
yonder
then
i
must
stop
for
i
shall
be
quite
and
in
a
minute
he
was
close
to
the
big
tree
but
just
as
swiftly
before
he
could
draw
another
breath
he
was
whisked
by
he
stuck
out
his
arm
the
one
that
wasn
t
carrying
the
green
umbrella
you
know
and
he
tried
to
catch
hold
of
the
tree
but
alas
he
was
running
by
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
now
the
big
tree
was
clear
way
behind
and
and
couldn
t
he
stop
cried
phronsie
with
wide
eyes
do
make
him
stop
i
can
t
said
polly
because
this
is
the
story
you
know
of
how
the
green
umbrella
ran
away
with
the
queer
little
old
illustration
the
umbrella
runs
away
with
the
queer
little
man
this
queer
little
old
man
has
got
to
run
phronsie
said
jasper
so
we
shall
have
to
let
but
phronsie
sighed
as
she
folded
her
hands
and
the
queer
little
old
man
knew
too
by
this
time
that
he
had
got
to
run
polly
was
saying
and
he
began
to
sigh
and
to
groan
oh
i
wish
i
hadn
t
taken
this
green
umbrella
and
all
the
while
he
was
going
faster
and
faster
till
his
head
began
to
spin
and
he
thought
he
should
drop
down
in
the
road
but
he
couldn
t
you
see
for
his
little
bits
of
feet
kept
hopping
and
skipping
along
so
of
course
there
was
no
time
for
him
to
tumble
flat
and
in
a
minute
he
came
to
a
great
big
pond
and
like
what
you
said
cherry
brook
was
cried
van
breaking
in
dear
me
no
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
this
was
ever
and
ever
so
many
times
bigger
like
oh
i
know
declared
joel
in
an
important
way
quite
delighted
to
show
van
his
superior
knowledge
it
was
like
spot
pond
polly
over
by
badgertown
yes
said
polly
with
shining
eyes
it
was
joel
just
like
dear
old
spot
pond
by
badgertown
woods
and
she
leaned
her
cheeks
on
her
two
hands
and
her
elbows
on
the
table
lost
in
delightful
reminiscence
over
joel
s
words
van
got
out
of
his
chair
and
slipping
away
from
the
reach
of
jasper
s
fingers
he
plucked
polly
s
sleeve
you
said
the
queer
little
old
man
and
the
green
umbrella
came
to
a
big
place
just
like
spot
pond
he
whispered
in
her
ear
what
oh
said
polly
lifting
her
head
up
suddenly
yes
so
i
did
well
now
said
the
poor
little
queer
old
man
to
himself
i
shall
surely
stop
i
am
so
glad
to
see
this
water
for
i
am
really
almost
run
to
but
the
green
umbrella
made
him
hop
clear
across
the
pond
and
there
he
was
on
the
other
side
running
for
dear
life
through
a
brambly
wood
and
up
the
side
of
a
van
ran
back
to
his
seat
hugging
himself
joyfully
at
this
entrancing
stage
of
the
story
now
there
were
some
people
living
on
the
top
of
that
mountain
said
polly
quite
impressively
who
were
very
funny
people
indeed
they
were
thin
and
tall
oh
just
as
thin
as
and
as
high
and
when
they
went
out
they
always
pulled
on
boots
and
what
are
those
boots
polly
asked
phronsie
quickly
oh
let
me
tell
her
cried
van
eagerly
delighted
to
think
there
was
something
he
could
show
off
in
to
advantage
i
know
my
fairy
book
tells
all
about
well
i
shall
tell
declared
percy
for
the
same
reason
you
see
phronsie
no
indeed
you
shall
not
exclaimed
van
in
a
dudgeon
and
forgetting
all
about
polly
pepper
being
there
i
began
first
and
deserting
his
chair
again
he
ran
over
to
phronsie
s
side
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
kept
it
folded
over
the
other
one
in
her
lap
and
looked
gravely
at
him
and
i
say
i
shall
cried
percy
in
a
passion
and
forgetting
the
same
thing
and
as
for
your
beginning
first
you
are
always
crowding
in
so
that
s
polly
leaned
back
in
her
big
chair
and
looked
at
them
in
dismay
and
i
think
you
would
both
better
go
out
of
my
den
said
jasper
coldly
o
jasper
exclaimed
polly
quickly
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
both
boys
turned
and
looked
at
her
i
didn
t
mean
to
exclaimed
van
wilting
miserably
and
i
didn
t
either
cried
percy
wishing
he
wasn
t
so
big
and
could
creep
into
a
corner
and
please
don
t
cried
polly
at
them
and
she
clasped
her
hands
and
her
cheeks
got
rosy
red
again
we
won
t
we
won
t
they
both
promised
and
van
slipped
back
to
his
seat
and
percy
said
you
may
tell
phronsie
van
if
you
want
no
i
don
t
said
van
getting
down
as
small
in
his
chair
as
he
could
feeling
polly
s
brown
eyes
looking
him
through
i
would
rather
have
polly
tell
me
said
phronsie
with
grave
eyes
for
both
of
the
boys
yes
you
tell
her
polly
do
said
jasper
that
is
so
polly
told
phronsie
all
about
what
boots
were
and
how
the
people
who
wore
them
could
take
great
big
steps
longer
than
anybody
else
in
all
the
world
and
how
they
could
jump
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
to
another
one
just
as
easily
as
anything
and
nothing
could
catch
them
and
so
you
see
said
polly
winding
up
her
description
when
these
tall
thin
people
heard
the
little
queer
man
with
the
green
umbrella
coming
up
they
all
burst
out
laughing
we
ll
show
him
what
running
is
get
on
your
boots
said
every
one
to
each
other
and
every
single
one
of
them
hurried
and
pulled
on
his
oh
goody
howled
joel
slipping
away
from
ben
s
hand
now
the
queer
little
old
man
tried
to
stop
when
he
got
up
to
them
but
instead
of
that
he
whisked
along
by
them
and
there
he
was
way
ahead
and
going
at
a
perfectly
dreadful
rate
ho
ho
cried
the
you
little
upstart
you
what
do
you
mean
by
going
by
us
without
a
word
for
you
see
they
didn
t
like
it
to
see
such
a
very
little
person
treat
them
so
coolly
and
there
he
was
way
off
ahead
of
them
we
ll
teach
you
better
manners
and
off
after
him
they
and
did
they
catch
him
cried
van
and
what
did
they
do
to
him
asked
percy
little
dick
who
hadn
t
spoken
but
had
been
lost
in
thought
now
got
out
of
his
chair
and
stumbled
into
the
centre
of
the
group
ha
ha
ha
he
screamed
suddenly
as
loud
as
he
could
goodness
me
dicky
how
you
scared
me
exclaimed
polly
with
a
jump
he
scared
us
all
i
guess
said
ben
and
you
would
better
get
back
into
that
chair
of
yours
said
jasper
if
you
don
t
want
the
house
to
come
down
on
our
heads
after
that
little
dick
thus
adjured
plunged
back
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
and
climbed
into
his
chair
but
step
as
long
and
as
high
as
they
could
the
couldn
t
come
up
to
the
queer
little
man
with
the
green
umbrella
for
just
as
soon
as
he
flew
out
of
one
city
over
the
and
the
big
houses
they
would
just
be
coming
in
and
so
all
they
could
see
of
him
would
be
the
green
umbrella
flying
along
and
a
little
twinkling
thing
with
tiny
sticks
of
legs
and
arms
under
it
and
at
last
besides
being
very
angry
they
were
very
much
puzzled
we
ve
never
had
anything
beat
us
before
they
called
to
each
other
as
they
stepped
along
and
all
the
while
don
t
you
think
the
queer
little
old
man
was
calling
and
screaming
back
at
them
oh
you
dear
big
for
he
didn
t
know
anything
about
boots
do
stop
me
for
i
m
running
away
and
i
can
t
stop
and
at
last
the
stopped
in
surprise
unable
to
take
another
step
they
were
so
much
astonished
let
s
talk
it
over
they
said
and
then
when
we
ve
come
to
a
conclusion
what
the
matter
is
why
we
ll
start
again
after
so
they
all
stopped
on
the
tip
of
the
nearest
mountain
and
sat
down
and
put
their
chins
in
their
hands
it
s
something
about
that
umbrella
at
last
said
one
suddenly
lifting
his
head
sure
enough
cried
another
slapping
him
on
the
back
that
s
the
brightest
thing
that
has
been
said
yet
think
some
i
believe
it
s
because
it
s
green
said
another
who
wanted
to
be
just
as
bright
too
sure
enough
said
the
who
had
said
so
before
now
we
must
get
him
to
throw
away
that
dreadful
green
umbrella
for
we
can
t
be
beaten
you
we
must
get
him
to
throw
away
that
dreadful
green
umbrella
repeated
every
one
of
the
then
they
all
got
up
and
and
did
they
get
the
queer
little
man
to
throw
away
the
green
umbrella
cried
little
davie
impulsively
oh
i
didn
t
mean
to
interrupt
polly
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
thought
i
know
davie
you
ve
been
real
good
said
polly
smiling
approvingly
at
him
well
now
you
ll
see
so
off
they
all
stepped
with
their
dreadfully
long
steps
after
the
queer
little
old
man
with
the
green
umbrella
and
pretty
soon
one
of
the
who
was
a
little
ahead
called
out
i
spy
him
he
isn
t
more
than
seven
miles
oh
my
screamed
joel
and
sure
enough
there
he
was
running
along
the
green
umbrella
just
flying
through
the
air
and
the
little
sticks
of
arms
and
legs
under
it
twinkling
in
and
out
hurry
hurry
hurry
now
for
your
lives
roared
all
the
at
each
other
and
they
raced
as
they
had
never
in
all
their
lives
raced
before
and
at
last
when
they
were
nearly
ready
to
drop
they
came
so
near
to
the
queer
little
man
that
they
could
hear
him
faintly
squeal
out
oh
do
stop
me
i
m
running
away
and
i
can
t
throw
down
that
dreadful
green
umbrella
roared
all
the
at
him
together
i
can
t
squealed
the
queer
little
man
running
on
faster
than
ever
it
won
t
let
go
of
my
neck
for
you
must
know
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
crooked
handle
that
used
to
hang
on
the
golden
peg
in
the
woodshed
where
araminta
sophia
hung
it
up
had
hooked
itself
after
he
got
to
running
fast
around
the
neck
of
the
queer
little
old
man
and
there
he
was
fast
and
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
ever
so
many
voices
did
it
hurt
him
asked
phronsie
piteously
oh
no
i
guess
not
pet
answered
polly
he
was
running
so
fast
i
don
t
believe
he
felt
it
much
anyway
he
couldn
t
get
it
off
try
as
hard
as
he
would
and
so
on
he
ran
worse
than
can
t
he
stop
asked
little
dick
suddenly
in
great
excitement
you
ll
see
dicky
said
polly
with
a
smile
while
the
others
begged
her
not
to
stop
but
to
hurry
on
shut
up
that
dreadful
green
umbrella
then
screamed
out
one
of
the
with
the
first
thing
that
came
in
his
head
and
in
a
minute
before
they
could
take
another
step
went
the
green
umbrella
went
the
green
umbrella
and
the
poor
little
legs
and
arms
of
the
queer
little
man
came
to
a
standstill
how
very
queer
he
gasped
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
before
he
snapped
out
as
the
all
came
up
for
he
was
very
cross
by
this
time
why
didn
t
you
think
of
it
yourself
instead
of
making
us
chase
you
all
over
the
world
they
snapped
back
for
you
see
they
were
very
cross
o
polly
had
they
been
all
over
the
world
cried
percy
in
astonishment
pretty
much
said
polly
and
you
see
they
were
very
tired
and
besides
they
didn
t
like
it
for
they
never
had
been
obliged
to
take
such
a
chase
i
should
like
to
ask
said
ben
what
this
queer
little
man
happened
to
be
standing
on
when
the
green
umbrella
got
shut
up
you
stopped
him
in
the
air
you
know
oh
i
forgot
to
say
polly
answered
briskly
with
a
little
laugh
that
they
happened
to
be
just
running
over
a
very
high
mountain
so
when
the
green
umbrella
got
shut
up
why
of
course
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
stand
still
on
the
top
of
oh
said
ben
xxi
the
little
dear
me
how
we
have

exclaimed
polly
sitting
down
and
wiping
her
hot
face
and

joel
excitedly

the
big

cried
joel
with
a
crow
of
delight
well
i
choose
for
polly
to

a
story
now
and
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
grassy
terrace
by
her
side
o
joel
pepper
exclaimed
jasper
in
dismay
we
none
of

joel
obstinately
and
shaking
his
stubby
black
hair
and
i
don
t
want
anything
else
so
begin
polly
do
and
he
drummed
impatiently
against
the
green
bank
with
his
heels
ben
said
jasper
in
despair
rushing
up
to
that
individual
isn
t
there

do
to

joe
to
his
senses
polly
s
tired
to

not
when
joe
makes
up
his
mind
and
we
did
promise
but

and
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
face
dropped
longer
yet
ben
s
going
to
tell
the
story
announced
jasper
rushing
back
cheerily
now
all
sit
down
as
phronsie
pattered
back
along
the
winding
road
through
the
shrubbery
having
run
a
race
with
herself
quite
contentedly
here
child
and
he
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
drew
her
into
his
lap
but
i

cried
joel
coolly
i

asserted
in
a
loud
and
positive
tone

said
jasper
shortly
here

contradicted
joel
looking
in
surprise
at
polly
s
blooming
cheeks
she
s
never
tired
and
you
ve
promised
he
repeated
in
an
injured
tone
and
i
m
quite
rested
now
exclaimed
polly
tossing
back
the
damp
rings
of
hair
away
from
her
brow
so
i
can
tell
it
just
as
well
but
what
in
the
world
shall
it
be
about
and
she
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
don
t
try
to
think
said
ben
who
threw
himself
on
the
grass
by
her
side
joe
s
a
mean
little
beggar
to
ask
it
polly
he
whispered
in
her
ear
but
polly
tossed
him
a
scrap
of
a
whisper
back
again
and
then
she
began
now
it
s
so
hot
and
the
middle
of
summer
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
it
ever
had
been
winter
with
the
snow
on
the
ground
and
it
will
make
us
cool
with
nice
little
creeps
all
down
our
backs
if
i
tell
you
about
our
little
and
joel
jumped
to
his
feet
with
howls
of
delight
o
polly
he
screamed
do
tell
about
it
that
s
the
most
splendid
story
of
all
then
he
suddenly
became
very
grave
and
stood
quite
still
come
along
and
sit
down
then
joel
said
polly
and
i
ll
but
joel
didn
t
move
come
along
cried
ben
quite
out
of
sorts
and
get
into
your
seat
and
don
t
stand
there
like
a
but
still
joel
stood
very
still
i
don
t
want
any
story
he
blurted
out
suddenly
don
t
want
any
story
repeated
percy
and
van
in
surprise
while
little
dick
began
to
cry
piteously
and
laid
his
head
in
polly
s
lap
polly
doesn
t
want
to
tell
it
began
joel
in
a
gasp
and
wishing
very
much
that
he
had
stayed
at
the
big
gate
where
he
won
the
race
oh
yes
i
do
cried
polly
brightly
i
want
to
tell
it
joey
i
do
truly
so
sit
down
like
a
good
boy
and
i
ll
begin
right
do
you
really
asked
joel
edging
up
with
both
black
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
yes
indeed
i
m
all
rested
now
declared
polly
and
if
i
don
t
tell
that
story
i
shall
feel
very
badly
indeed
joey
so
joel
feeling
that
it
was
quite
right
to
be
glad
that
the
story
was
to
be
told
since
polly
had
said
that
she
should
feel
badly
if
she
didn
t
tell
it
gave
another
whoop
of
delight
and
scuttled
back
to
crowd
in
next
to
polly
while
the
others
settled
down
in
great
satisfaction
and
polly
began
in
her
cheeriest
fashion
well
you
must
know
boys
that
we
used
to
have
just
the
best
times
in
the
little
brown
house
the
minute
it
began
to
be
winter
and
the
snow
commenced
to
fall
and
we
could
look
out
and
see
it
all
and
plan
what
we
could
and
you
could
get
your
sleds
out
burst
in
van
and
go
sleighing
too
said
percy
oh
we
didn
t
have
sleds
said
polly
quickly
at
least
only
one
that
ben
made
didn
t
have
sleds
exclaimed
the
whitney
boys
i
helped
said
joel
sturdily
and
so
did
well
i
guess
it
wouldn
t
have
been
much
of
a
sled
unless
ben
had
made
it
said
polly
looking
up
at
ben
affectionately
but
you
two
boys
did
help
though
she
made
haste
to
add
as
she
saw
their
faces
and
we
couldn
t
go
coasting
only
when
we
had
all
our
work
done
polly
went
on
because
you
see
we
were
poor
and
that
was
there
was
silence
for
the
space
of
a
moment
it
being
quite
beyond
the
power
of
the
whitney
boys
to
say
anything
but
when
mamsie
did
let
us
go
oh
it
was
perfectly
splendid
and
polly
s
cheeks
grew
rosy
red
and
her
eyes
kindled
in
delight
at
the
remembrance
tell
us
tell
us
begged
percy
and
van
coming
out
of
their
deep
reflection
well
maybe
some
time
said
polly
but
now
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
our
little
you
see
it
had
been
awfully
cold
one
winter
here
polly
hurried
on
with
all
her
speed
after
a
glance
at
ben
s
face
and
we
hadn
t
had
much
snow
because
it
was
most
too
cold
to
snow
and
we
children
had
been
hoping
that
we
might
have
some
and
every
day
joel
would
come
shouting
in
that
he
guessed
it
would
snow
before
night
and
and
we
had
to
fill
the
and
chop
kindlings
all
the
time
i
remember
grumbled
joel
and
our
fingers
most
froze
didn
t
they
maybe
said
david
with
a
glance
at
polly
s
face
and
very
much
wishing
that
the
question
had
not
been
asked
never
mind
said
ben
don
t
bother
to
tell
any
more
about
the
cold
polly
but
get
along
to
the
and
so
i
will
she
said
briskly
with
another
look
at
his
face
well
and
one
day
oh
i
remember
it
as
well
as
could
be
for
joel
had
said
the
same
thing
about
the
snow
coming
over
and
over
and
and
it
did
come
interrupted
joel
triumphantly
so
there
you
mustn
t
tell
before
i
get
to
it
said
polly
that
s
a
fact
said
ben
if
polly
tells
this
story
she
must
be
let
alone
now
joe
don
t
you
say
another
joel
at
this
subsided
and
folded
his
chubby
hands
tightly
together
and
polly
went
on
well
and
pretty
soon
do
you
know
down
came
the
white
flakes
of
snow
so
soft
and
pretty
and
white
and
mamsie
said
we
might
stop
our
work
for
five
minutes
and
watch
it
from
the
window
we
d
wanted
it
so
you
know
for
days
and
days
and
then
david
and
joel
began
to
scream
how
they
were
going
to
take
the
sled
ben
had
made
out
that
afternoon
as
soon
as
the
ground
was
covered
and
have
a
fine
time
coasting
and
then
mamsie
told
us
to
look
around
at
the
clock
and
we
did
and
then
our
time
was
up
and
we
had
to
fly
at
our
work
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
the
whitney
boys
with
one
voice
well
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
snow
was
pretty
deep
it
had
been
falling
just
as
thick
and
fast
as
could
be
and
joel
came
stamping
in
from
the
woodshed
where
he
had
been
cutting
kindlings
and
he
pulled
on
his
mittens
and
said
now
mamsie
may
we
and
come
on
david
all
at
the
same
just
as
he
says
two
thing
together
now
said
ben
bursting
into
a
laugh
in
which
all
joined
at
joel
s
expense
until
he
laughed
too
but
mamsie
shook
her
head
not
until
i
ve
gone
into
the
provision
room
and
seen
how
many
potatoes
and
how
much
indian
meal
we
have
left
joey
she
said
and
then
off
she
went
and
joel
pounded
his
heels
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
slapped
his
hands
in
the
mittens
together
and
kept
calling
on
david
to
hurry
and
be
ready
when
mamsie
came
back
oh
i
remember
just
as
well
as
can
be
just
everything
about
that
afternoon
and
polly
came
to
a
sudden
stop
lost
in
thought
polly
pepper
polly
pepper
cried
van
shaking
her
elbow
do
tell
us
the
and
did
she
let
joel
and
david
go
coasting
begged
percy
trying
to
conceal
the
eagerness
he
felt
in
the
recital
you
ll
see
said
polly
waking
out
of
her
revery
well
at
last
mamsie
came
back
from
the
provision
room
and
the
very
first
look
that
we
had
of
her
face
we
knew
that
joel
and
david
couldn
t
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
the
whitney
children
horribly
disappointed
boys
said
mamsie
there
isn
t
very
much
indian
meal
ahead
and
the
stock
of
potatoes
is
getting
low
now
i
could
let
you
off
this
afternoon
but
it
s
wiser
not
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
so
we
must
lay
in
another
supply
and
that
s
all
she
said
but
she
just
and
i
didn
t
want
to
go
to
the
store
after
that
old
meal
and
those
old
potatoes
blurted
out
joel
suddenly
not
looking
at
any
one
but
you
did
go
joel
cried
polly
immediately
oh
yes
he
did
boys
she
repeated
emphatically
he
went
real
good
and
mamsie
was
joel
brightened
up
at
that
and
brought
down
his
gaze
from
the
tip
of
one
of
the
tallest
trees
on
the
opposite
terrace
as
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
yes
said
mamsie
and
i
remember
just
exactly
how
she
looked
as
she
said
it
it
is
always
the
right
thing
to
get
what
will
be
needed
before
it
is
and
then
the
boys
ran
off
and
dragged
the
sled
out
of
the
woodshed
and
away
they
ran
off
down
the
road
pulling
it
after
and
couldn
t
they
go
coasting
as
soon
as
they
got
the
potatoes
demanded
percy
and
the
meal
begged
van
anxiously
why
you
see
atkins
the
man
who
kept
the
store
you
know
had
a
great
deal
to
do
that
afternoon
and
it
took
so
long
to
wait
on
all
his
customers
that
it
was
dark
before
the
boys
got
home
and
they
had
to
fill
the
for
the
next
morning
and
so
mamsie
said
they
must
wait
until
illustration
the
boys
bringing
home
the
meal
and
potatoes
oh
exclaimed
the
two
whitneys
well
we
all
went
to
bed
early
that
night
joel
and
david
meant
to
get
up
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
go
out
and
coast
they
said
it
was
snowing
beautifully
when
mamsie
looked
out
the
last
thing
and
it
was
dreadfully
deep
and
ben
said
he
d
be
sure
to
find
time
to
give
phronsie
a
ride
on
the
sled
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
it
was
morning
only
we
didn
t
know
it
was
morning
said
polly
with
a
funny
little
laugh
what
do
you
mean
that
you
didn
t
know
it
was
morning
asked
van
oh
i
mean
never
mind
you
ll
see
when
i
get
to
it
said
polly
who
never
liked
to
be
pushed
ahead
of
her
story
well
the
first
thing
i
knew
mamsie
was
calling
me
polly
in
such
a
funny
voice
that
i
hopped
right
up
into
the
middle
of
the
big
bed
get
on
your
clothes
as
quickly
as
possible
and
come
out
here
said
mamsie
and
i
flew
out
of
bed
oh
how
i
wanted
to
just
peep
into
the
kitchen
and
see
what
was
the
matter
but
i
knew
mamsie
wouldn
t
like
it
so
i
got
dressed
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
and
ran
out
there
was
mamsie
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
polly
child
she
said
we
re
snowed
in
there
was
a
breathless
silence
for
a
minute
that
nobody
seemed
able
to
break
yes
said
polly
and
don
t
you
think
there
we
were
buried
up
in
our
little
brown
o
polly
cried
van
in
a
horrified
tone
didn
t
you
ever
get
out
why
yes
said
polly
of
course
or
else
we
wouldn
t
be
here
don
t
feel
so
van
as
she
saw
his
face
it
didn
t
hurt
us
any
you
know
because
we
all
got
out
in
good
time
and
we
had
some
fun
while
being
shut
up
in
our
little
is
that
what
you
mean
by
the
little
the
story
is
about
asked
percy
who
was
so
bound
up
in
the
story
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
opportunity
to
laugh
at
van
yes
said
polly
gayly
it
was
and
our
little
brown
house
was
made
into
a
little
and
now
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
it
well
when
mamsie
said
that
i
just
put
my
arms
around
her
and
she
held
me
close
for
a
minute
for
you
see
we
didn
t
know
what
to
do
and
then
i
said
i
m
going
to
call
illustration
the
little
but
polly
didn
t
call
us
then
said
joel
in
an
injured
tone
and
dave
and
i
slept
over
till
ever
so
and
so
did
phronsie
said
ben
and
i
wish
we
could
have
kept
you
all
in
bed
the
rest
of
that
but
you
couldn
t
said
joel
bobbing
his
head
and
just
as
soon
as
we
did
wake
up
we
found
out
all
about
well
keep
still
now
joe
said
ben
and
let
polly
finish
the
it
was
just
as
dark
polly
was
saying
oh
you
can
t
think
how
dreadfully
dark
it
was
till
mamsie
lighted
her
candle
for
when
we
tried
to
look
out
of
the
window
why
we
couldn
t
because
you
see
there
was
the
white
snow
piled
up
against
it
tight
and
we
couldn
t
open
the
why
not
asked
little
dick
because
we
d
go
right
into
a
big
snowbank
if
we
did
oh
ever
and
ever
so
much
higher
than
our
heads
and
besides
the
snow
would
tumble
in
the
house
and
then
we
couldn
t
shut
the
door
again
so
mamsie
told
us
not
to
touch
it
oh
dear
dear
it
was
perfectly
dreadful
a
shiver
passed
over
the
group
that
made
the
nice
little
creeps
run
down
each
back
as
polly
began
again
well
and
there
we
were
shut
up
in
our
little
brown
house
and
we
didn
t
know
when
any
one
would
come
to
dig
us
why
didn
t
you
run
and
look
out
cried
van
thrusting
himself
forward
excitedly
dear
me
we
did
that
the
first
thing
said
polly
i
mean
ben
did
he
tried
to
look
out
of
the
window
in
the
loft
because
you
know
we
didn
t
have
any
but
a
little
place
in
the
loft
where
the
boys
slept
and
all
he
could
see
was
the
top
of
the
snow
where
it
had
blown
all
up
everywhere
and
then
he
ran
down
and
told
mamsie
and
me
in
the
kitchen
oh
you
can
t
think
how
perfectly
dreadful
it
was
those
first
few
minutes
we
were
so
glad
the
children
were
fast
asleep
in
their
well
we
weren
t
grumbled
joel
who
always
felt
defrauded
out
of
every
one
of
those
dreadful
minutes
dave
and
i
wanted
to
be
down
in
the
kitchen
with
mamsie
and
why
you
didn
t
know
anything
of
it
said
ben
with
a
little
laugh
well
we
wanted
to
be
there
if
we
didn
t
said
joel
not
minding
the
laugh
in
which
the
others
joined
and
mamsie
said
we
were
not
to
worry
for
god
would
take
care
of
us
said
polly
gravely
and
then
she
asked
him
to
do
it
and
to
send
some
one
to
dig
us
out
and
then
she
said
and
i
ll
never
forget
it
now
children
we
must
set
ourselves
to
think
what
we
ought
to
do
and
go
to
work
because
god
doesn
t
help
people
who
do
not
help
and
then
we
all
sat
down
to
think
up
the
best
thing
to
do
and
ben
said
he
thought
we
ought
to
tie
something
to
a
long
stick
and
run
it
out
the
window
and
maybe
no
that
was
polly
s
idea
said
ben
quickly
she
thought
of
it
o
ben
you
surely
said
so
cried
polly
with
rosy
cheeks
well
you
spoke
of
it
first
and
so
i
said
i
d
do
it
declared
ben
positively
it
was
polly
who
thought
it
all
well
you
got
the
red
blanket
and
tied
it
on
the
broom
said
polly
so
you
did
it
that
s
nothing
said
ben
we
all
thought
of
the
blanket
because
it
was
red
and
would
show
against
the
snow
and
after
that
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
so
we
all
three
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
and
looked
at
each
yes
said
polly
shaking
her
head
very
mournfully
that
was
the
hardest
part
of
it
all
there
wasn
t
anything
to
do
oh
dear
me
it
was
perfectly
dreadful
you
can
t
think
how
dreadful
it
all
and
pretty
soon
mamsie
said
now
children
we
ll
get
breakfast
the
same
as
usual
thank
god
that
we
have
got
a
large
supply
of
meal
and
potatoes
in
the
provision
room
so
we
sha
n
t
starve
look
at
the
clock
polly
and
there
don
t
you
think
said
polly
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
was
ticking
away
the
minutes
as
fast
as
it
could
and
it
was
eight
and
we
always
used
to
get
up
at
six
o
clock
in
winter
i
six
o
clock
in
winter
cried
percy
in
amazement
who
dearly
loved
his
bed
of
a
morning
oh
dear
me
that
s
the
middle
of
the
well
if
you
think
that
s
early
what
do
you
think
of
five
o
clock
said
ben
under
his
breath
and
just
think
of
ben
polly
was
saying
with
a
little
pat
on
ben
s
back
he
used
to
have
all
his
chores
done
by
six
o
clock
because
he
had
to
go
and
help
other
people
and
earn
percy
tumbled
right
over
on
the
green
bank
quite
overcome
by
this
and
lay
there
lost
in
thought
yes
it
was
eight
said
polly
impressively
and
when
i
looked
at
the
clock
i
jumped
up
glad
of
something
to
do
for
i
d
been
twisting
my
hands
together
trying
not
to
cry
she
confessed
drooping
her
brown
head
in
a
shamedfaced
way
but
you
didn
t
cry
declared
ben
stoutly
polly
didn
t
let
a
single
tear
come
out
of
her
eyes
she
was
just
splendid
all
the
no
i
wasn
t
splendid
said
polly
but
the
color
ran
over
her
cheek
again
and
up
to
the
little
waves
of
hair
on
her
brow
as
she
smiled
at
ben
and
when
mamsie
told
us
to
get
breakfast
why
ben
and
i
were
glad
enough
to
hop
up
and
set
to
work
so
he
ran
and
kindled
the
fire
and
pretty
soon
there
it
was
blazing
away
right
merrily
because
you
see
we
had
our
new
stove
then
what
we
should
have
done
with
our
old
one
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
said
polly
holding
up
both
hands
and
i
said
it
was
lucky
we
had
such
a
splendid
lot
of
wood
all
cut
in
the
woodshed
said
ben
when
i
came
back
to
fill
up
the
again
after
i
had
made
the
fire
and
mamsie
said
never
say
lucky
again
ben
but
say
faithful
work
provides
for
the
i
ve
thought
of
it
ever
and
that
s
the
reason
you
ve
got
plenty
of
wood
now
said
polly
took
up
the
story
quickly
and
she
said
that
ben
had
been
plucky
instead
of
lucky
to
stick
to
it
when
he
wanted
to
rest
well
then
we
heard
an
awful
noise
up
in
the
what
was
it
cried
van
getting
involuntarily
nearer
to
polly
and
ben
was
it
bears
worse
than
bears
said
ben
decidedly
worse
than
bears
van
was
quite
delighted
but
he
drew
still
farther
within
the
centre
of
the
group
and
cast
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
expected
something
to
jump
from
behind
the
trees
yes
said
ben
nodding
his
head
was
it
a
snake
asked
little
dick
huddling
up
close
to
polly
to
lay
his
head
in
her
lap
again
worse
than
a
snake
said
ben
oh
dear
dear
what
was
it
cried
van
and
dick
together
while
percy
got
up
quickly
and
pushed
in
between
the
others
what
was
it
he
asked
too
those
two
boys
said
ben
pointing
to
joel
and
davie
they
made
more
noise
than
a
dozen
bears
as
soon
as
they
woke
up
and
found
out
how
things
were
i
tell
you
it
was
pretty
lively
then
down
in
the
and
we
hadn
t
seen
ben
run
out
the
stick
with
the
red
blanket
on
said
joel
in
a
dudgeon
flinging
himself
flat
on
the
grass
to
drum
his
heels
on
the
green
sward
it
was
mean
not
to
wake
us
well
you
saw
it
afterward
said
ben
coolly
and
if
you
d
had
your
way
joe
the
old
broom
would
have
rattled
down
a
dozen
times
you
wanted
to
shake
it
so
that
was
to
make
folks
see
it
and
come
and
dig
us
out
said
joel
squinting
up
at
the
sky
well
let
polly
tell
the
story
said
jasper
who
had
been
quiet
all
this
time
and
then
just
think
what
mamsie
said
to
those
two
here
polly
jumped
up
to
her
feet
oh
it
was
so
splendid
and
her
eyes
kindled
and
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
she
said
and
these
are
just
her
words
boys
you
ve
maybe
saved
all
our
lives
by
giving
up
your
play
yesterday
and
getting
that
meal
and
those
just
think
of
that
cried
polly
again
clasping
her
hands
mamsie
said
that
to
two
boys
oh
i
m
so
proud
of
them
with
that
polly
ran
back
to
the
green
bank
and
in
a
minute
she
had
her
two
arms
around
joel
and
david
and
jasper
proposed
three
cheers
and
van
led
them
off
percy
coming
in
in
time
for
the
end
as
phronsie
gave
a
delighted
little
gurgle
twasn
t
anything
said
joel
red
and
shining
in
his
efforts
to
escape
all
praise
dave
and
i
didn
t
do
twas
meal
and
potatoes
cried
little
dick
stumbling
up
and
down
the
path
and
getting
in
everybody
s
way
and
then
they
all
laughed
and
settled
down
for
the
end
of
the
story
well
said
polly
with
a
long
breath
and
beginning
again
you
can
t
think
how
glad
we
were
to
have
work
to
do
on
that
dreadful
day
we
washed
every
dish
in
the
house
over
and
over
and
cleaned
and
tidied
up
and
then
when
we
hadn
t
any
more
work
we
sat
round
and
told
oh
will
you
tell
us
some
of
those
stories
you
told
in
the
little
polly
pepper
cried
van
in
a
shout
some
time
said
polly
go
on
polly
said
ben
and
tell
about
sitting
around
the
oh
yes
said
polly
briskly
you
see
children
we
couldn
t
burn
our
candles
all
day
because
mamsie
hadn
t
such
a
very
great
many
and
so
after
phronsie
woke
up
and
our
work
was
done
up
we
sat
around
the
stove
and
told
stories
in
the
oh
oh
exclaimed
the
whitney
boys
yes
and
then
said
ben
polly
asked
mamsie
if
we
might
play
blindman
she
said
yes
and
so
we
yes
and
we
played
and
all
sorts
of
things
we
never
had
the
time
to
play
on
other
days
we
played
in
our
little
oh
we
had
a
lovely
time
after
all
and
didn
t
anybody
come
to
dig
you
out
asked
percy
feeling
as
if
the
delights
of
such
a
frolic
wouldn
t
pay
him
for
being
shut
up
in
a
little
and
he
shivered
as
he
spoke
no
said
polly
at
least
not
till
the
next
day
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
some
one
screamed
hallo
there
and
don
t
you
think
we
heard
deacon
brown
s
voice
through
the
snow
they
d
dug
quite
a
piece
towards
us
and
they
were
shouting
to
let
us
know
they
were
and
didn
t
you
scream
back
polly
pepper
didn
t
you
didn
t
you
cried
all
the
whitneys
together
in
intense
excitement
i
rather
guess
we
did
said
ben
with
shining
eyes
it
s
a
wonder
the
roof
of
the
little
brown
house
didn
t
fly
off
with
the
noise
we
peppers
xxii
lucy
ann
s
garden
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
said
polly
as
the
little
group
settled
down
in
one
corner
of
mother
pepper
s
room
when
i
told
the
others
the
story
of
lucy
ann
s
garden
i
remember
the
time
because
we
were
all
feeling
pretty
badly
to
be
shut
up
in
the
little
for
we
always
ran
every
now
and
then
you
know
even
when
we
were
working
and
it
seemed
just
like
a
prison
and
then
we
didn
t
know
when
we
would
be
dug
out
and
but
you
were
dug
out
some
time
weren
t
you
polly
pepper
interrupted
van
anxiously
a
shout
greeted
this
question
when
they
came
out
of
the
laugh
polly
said
yes
but
it
was
two
whole
days
and
every
single
hour
seemed
oh
as
long
you
can
t
think
you
see
everybody
else
was
snowed
in
too
and
great
high
drifts
were
piled
along
the
roads
so
they
couldn
t
get
to
us
and
so
all
we
could
do
was
to
wait
but
oh
dear
me
polly
had
no
further
words
at
her
command
and
her
hands
fell
idly
to
her
lap
well
go
this
time
it
was
percy
who
pulled
her
sleeve
so
i
know
all
about
the
time
when
i
began
to
tell
about
lucy
ann
s
garden
said
polly
beginning
again
i
thought
i
d
make
up
a
story
about
summer
and
flowers
and
all
the
things
we
have
when
it
is
warm
and
sunny
so
we
could
look
forward
to
it
all
and
that
s
the
reason
i
told
them
tell
us
now
said
jasper
do
so
polly
began
the
story
in
earnest
lucy
ann
s
garden
wasn
t
a
bit
like
any
other
garden
in
all
the
world
it
was
up
on
the
tops
of
ever
so
many
trees
oh
oh
exclaimed
the
bunch
of
whitneys
in
delight
jasper
adding
his
approval
to
the
rest
this
is
a
splendid
story
declared
joel
to
van
who
was
next
you
better
hush
said
van
edging
away
i
can
t
hear
polly
when
you
you
see
lucy
ann
s
father
had
ever
so
many
he
was
going
to
cut
down
because
they
didn
t
have
anything
on
them
but
shrivelled
up
miserable
little
apples
and
he
got
his
big

and

day
and
lucy

saw
him
and
she
ran
after
him
father
father
she
cried
what
are
you
going
to
do
and
then
he
told
her
oh
dear
me
said
lucy
ann
and
then
she
just
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
cried
for
she
couldn
t
bear
to
have
a
tree
cut
down
around
her
home
nor
a
chicken
killed
nor
anything
how
could
they
ever
have
then
asked
percy
abruptly
why
they
had
to
send
lucy
ann
over
to
spend
the
day
with
her
grandmother
said
polly
and
then
they
killed
all
the
chickens
they
wanted
to
eat
for
a
week
but
lucy
ann
always
cried
quarts
of
tears
when
she
came
home
and
found

exclaimed
van

t

in
the
world
said
polly
stoutly
and
i
m
making
up
a
girl
who
could
cry
quarts
of
tears
so
she
cried
them
every
time
she
came
home
and
found
one
of
those
chickens
now
it
s
hard
enough
to
have
to
tell
stories
by
the
dozen
as
polly
pepper
does
and
be
called
to
account
for
every
word
said
jasper
polly

quarts
begged
joel
glowering
at
van
make
it
gallons
no
said
polly
decidedly
lucy
ann
cried
quarts
of
tears
well
so
when
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
cried
her
father
fell
into
a
tremble
and
he
shook
so
the
big
axe
in
his
hand
went
every
way
for
he
couldn
t
hold
it
straight
and
he
looked
at
lucy
ann
and
he
said
daughter
i
wish
you
would
stop
i
can
t
said
lucy
ann
crying
worse
than
ever
till
her
tears
ran
into
the
grass
and
off
a
little
stream
trickling
away
like
a
tiny
wee
river
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
her
father
in
despair
this
is
something
very
then
he
set
his
axe
carefully
up
against
the
first
tree
he
was
going
to
cut
off
and
he
went
to
lucy
ann
daughter
he
said
if
you
ll
stop
crying
this
very
minute
by
my
watch
i
ll
give
you
this
first
tree
i
was
going
to
cut
so
lucy
ann
took
her
face
up
for
she
was
bending
over
to
sob
and
she
wiped
the
tears
that
were
coming
out
of
her
eyes
away
with
her
hand
and
her
father
ran
cheerfully
back
and
picked
up
his
axe
again
now
that
is
good
my
daughter
he
said
in
a
gleeful
voice
and
he
hurried
to
the
next
tree
and
raised
the
axe
just
like
here
polly
swung
an
imaginary
axe
over
her
shoulder
now
then
but
he
didn
t
bring
it
down
for
lucy
ann
squealed
right
out
o
father
don
t
now
i
ve
got
to
cry
some
more
and
away
she
went
to
sobbing
just
as
much
worse
than
at
first
as
you
could
think
and
the
tears
got
bigger
and
rounder
and
they
raced
through
the
grass
so
fast
that
they
wet
her
feet
till
she
began
to
sneeze
like
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
little
dick
in
dismay
well
lucy
ann
s
father
when
he
saw
that
set
down
the
axe
again
and
he
pulled
his
hair
in
distress
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
he
always
pulled
his
hair
when
he
felt
troubled
about
anything
that
was
much
better
than
to
pull
any
one
else
s
hair
observed
ben
under
his
breath
to
jasper
and
he
said
o
my
daughter
lucy
ann

you
only
won
t
cry
any
more
i
ll
give
you
all
those
trees
this
very
minute
and
you
may
do
what
you
want
to
with
so
lucy
ann
stopped
sobbing
and
wiped
her
eyes
again
and
got
up
from
the
grass
and
went
around
and
around
those
trees
she
went
around
times
before
she
could
decide
what
she
would
do
with
them
and
at
last
she
said
father
i
ll
have
a
garden
up
on
top
of

exclaimed
van
the
minute
lucy
ann
said
she
would
have

garden
up
on
top
of
the
trees
her
father
put
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
made
a
perfectly
awful
whistle
and
oh
i
know
how
he
did
it
exclaimed
joel
springing
to
his
feet
dave
and
i
used
to
do
it
this
way
and
he
clapped
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
but
ben

boy
for

m
going
on
with
the
story
well
as
soon
as
the
whistle
echoed
all
over
the
place
there
came
running
from
every
direction
ever
so
many
men
and
every
one
had
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
lucy
ann
s
father
and
lucy
ann
they
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
handles
of
their
axes
and
said
did
you
call
us
master

talking
roared
lucy
ann
s
father
at
them
for
he
wanted
to
be
cross
with
somebody
and
he
didn
t
want
to
scold
his
daughter
do
just
as
she
tells
you
to
and
then
he
picked
up
his
own
axe
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
feet
would
carry
him
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
and
locked

off
all
the
tops
of
those

s
only
the
tops
she
wanted

off
and
ben
said
wait
and
hear
the
rest
of
the
and
so
the
men
with
the
axes
did
exactly
as
lucy
ann
told
them
and
pretty
soon
all
the
trees
were
snipped
off
even
and
just
alike
now
go
and
bring
a
board
big
enough
to
set
on
the
tops
of
all
those
trees
she
commanded
and
lay
it
on
them
for
i
m
going
to
have
a
garden
up
oh
oh
oh
screamed
the
whitneys
delightedly
and
in
just
ten
minutes
by
lucy
ann
s
little
diamond
watch
in
her
belt
it
o
polly
did
lucy
ann
have
a
watch
all
made
of

polly
in
her
most
decisive
fashion
and
hers
was
just
one
big
diamond
with
the
minute
hand
and
the
hour
hand
set
in
the
middle
oh
gasped
ben
tumbling
back
in
his
seat
and
in
just
ten
minutes
repeated
polly
by
that
little
diamond
watch
stuck
in
her
belt
the
board
was
up
on
top
of
all
those
trees
and
then
she
commanded
the
men
to
cover
it
all
over
with
dirt
ever
so
deep
and
after
that
she
made
them
build
some
cunning
little
steps
leading
up
to
it
two
pairs
of
steps
because
i
never
mean
to
go
down
the
same
pair
i
come
up
she
said
to
herself
and
in
just
half
an
hour
from
the
time
she
began
to
think
about
it
there
was
her
garden
all
done
and
her
father
peeped
out
of
the
window
all
the
time
and
he
called
her
mother
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
and
every

took
a
window
and
watched
to
see
how
the
work
went
i
should
think
they
d

ben
with
another
gasp
and
then
lucy
ann
said
now

just
as
fast
as
you
can
every
single
one
of
you
and
she
stamped
her
foot
to
make
them
run
faster
so
they
picked
up
their
axes
and
scampered
off
and
she
was
left
alone
and
then
she
walked
around
her
garden
times
more
trying
to
think
what
she
would
plant
in
and
what
did
she
polly
pepper
demanded
van
eagerly
what
did
she
plant
in
it
wait
and
see

polly
gayly
well
when
she
had
got
around
the
time
she
sat
down
quite
tired
out
and
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
over
the
grass
came
running
a
little
girl
not
much
bigger
than

so
betserilda

then
the
two

suddenly
i

into
the
house
and
get
my
pink
gauze
gown
all
ready
and
my
little
silver

on

bed
and
then
tell

cook
to
make
five
hundred
little
and
cakes
and
put
each
on
a
big
green
leaf
when

s
ready
to
bring
up
to
the
garden
run
for
your
life
so
betserilda
ran
for
her
life
down
one
pair
of
stairs
and
lucy
ann
hopped
down
the
other
pair
and
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
and
the
and
the
snakes
and
all
the
rest
of
them
kept
combing
their
hair
and
prinking
up
and
peeking
out
of
the
wood
and
saying
to
each
other
hasn
t
the
sun
gone
down
yet
and
isn
t
the
moon
ever
coming
up
until
at
last
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
party
and
everybody
in
lucy
ann
s
house
kept
peeking
out
of
all
the
windows
they
didn
t
even
stop
for
dinner
but
had
the
servants
bring
it
to
them
and
they
ate
it
sitting
in
the
windows
so
they
needn
t
miss
anything
so
when
the
moonlight
really
did
come
they
were
all
ready
to
see
every
bit
of
the
party
too
well
lucy
ann
in
her
pink
gauze
gown
tripped
away
across
the
grass
in
her
little
silver
slippers
and
went
up
the
stairs
to
her
garden
with
betserilda
coming
after
and
when
all
the
saw
her
going
up
and
knew
that
the
party
was
actually
to
begin
they
all
started
in
fine
shape
but
they
had
to
wait
a
bit
which
was
quite
a
pity
for
the
biggest
squirrel
and
the
long
brown
snake
fell
into
a
quarrel
which
should
go
first
in
the
procession
lucy
ann
invited
me
first
said
the
big
squirrel
chattering
so
fast
they
could
hardly
hear
the
words
she
likes
me
best
said
the
long
brown
snake
lashing
the
on
the
ground
with
his
tail
this
made
the
big
squirrel
very
angry
and
he
cried
in
a
sharp
voice
i
ll
bite
you
and
he
was
just
going
to
do
it
when
somebody
way
back
in
the
procession
cried
out
you
re
mussing
your
hair
flying
in
such
a
to
be
sure
said
the
big
squirrel
putting
up
one
paw
to
smooth
his
head
carefully
let
us
not
quarrel
and
bite
till
after
the
party
we
will
both
go
in
together
that
s
the
best
as
you
like
said
the
long
brown
snake
who
didn
t
want
to
fight
there
is
room
enough
for
us
both
as
i
am
quite
so
they
both
led
off
and
soon
they
were
all
up
in
the
garden
and
making
splendid
bows
and
courtesies
to
lucy
ann
and
as
fast
as
each
one
made
his
bow
or
courtesy
she
would
say
if
it
pleased
her
that
s
a
good
one
check
it
off
betserilda
and
betserilda
would
make
a
little
mark
in
a
big
black
book
she
had
in
her
hand
and
if
it
was
very
bad
lucy
ann
would
say
it
must
be
done
over
again
but
at
last
they
were
ready
to
who
danced
with
lucy
ann
asked
van
breaking
in
but
jasper
pulled
him
back
and
polly
went
on
and
the
cricket
band
struck
up
and
then
lucy
ann
stood
upon
a
mushroom
she
had
had
brought
up
in
the
garden
for
a
stool
so
she
looked
very
tall
and
big
and
she
said
look
at
me
and
everybody
looked
at
her
with
all
his
eyes
i
am
going
to
say
i
m
not
going
to
dance
with
any
of
you
she
said
for
you
see
i
can
not
dance
with
all
i
should
be
quite
tired
out
there
are
so
many
of
you
but
i
must
dance
so
i
am
going
to
wait
for
my
prince
for
of
course
some
one
will
come
and
she
smoothed
down
her
pink
gauze
gown
in
great
contentment
and
fluttered
her
pink
feather
fan
now
begin
i
shall
wait
for
my
prince
and
she
hopped
off
from
her
mushroom
stool
and
the
cricket
band
struck
up
their
liveliest
tune
and
while
lucy
ann
sat
down
by
a
little
clump
of
violets
at
the
very
end
of
her
garden
every
single
one
of
the
party
folks
began
to
dance
now
there
was
in
the
wood
one
person
who
didn
t
happen
to
be
invited
to
that
party
lucy
ann
didn
t
know
he
was
there
so
she
couldn
t
send
him
an
invitation
you
see
and
he
had
only
arrived
that
day
being
on
his
way
to
another
place
when
he
succeeded
in
running
away
from
a
cruel
master
and
when
he
saw
the
nice
cool
wood
he
thought
he
would
stop
awhile
and
get
rested
and
then
he
overheard
the
chatter
about
the
party
though
nobody
saw
him
and
after
that
he
made
up
his
mind
he
would
stay
and
see
it
all
from
an
overhanging
i
know
what
it
was
piped
phronsie
in
a
gleeful
voice
he
was
a
hush
hush
cried
ben
springing
forward
and
don
t
tell
pet
from
polly
as
she
rushed
on
and
when
he
heard
lucy
ann
say
that
about
her
prince
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
dance
with
her
he
said
to
himself
why
shouldn
t
i
be
the
prince
and
the
next
minute
he
was
combing
his
hair
and
prinking
up
and
then
he
was
oh
oh
screamed
all
those
who
hadn
t
heard
the
story
in
the
little
and
joel
kept
nudging
van
and
saying
didn
t
i
tell
you
it
was
a
prime
one
well
it
was
getting
pretty
late
now
you
know
for
the
prince
was
so
anxious
to
look
nice
he
took
a
good
deal
of
time
to
prink
up
and
lucy
ann
began
to
look
sad
and
she
called
betserilda
who
had
to
stand
perfectly
still
behind
the
clump
of
violets
i
am
really
afraid
i
shall
have
to
cry
said
lucy
ann
for
my
prince
doesn
t
come
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
for
my
tears
will
make
it
so
wet
in
the
garden
that
they
will
all
get
cold
and
just
then
up
came
the
prince
his
cap
in
his
hand
along
the
stairway
and
there
was
the
sweetest
dearest
little
monkey
you
ever
saw
in
a
red
coat
standing
before
her
cried
polly
with
a
sudden
flourish
and
jumping
to
her
feet
xxiii
the
china
mug
oh
no
i
won
t
have
them
on
declared
little
dick
shaking
his
head
savagely
till
it
seemed
as
if
every
one
of
the
small
bits
of
brown
paper
must
fly
off
o
dicky
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
you
ve
bumped
your
head
so
falling
haven
t
bumped
my
head
cried
dick
whirling
around
so
that
none
of
the
children
could
investigate
the
big
lumps
on
his
head
i
wish
they
d
all
tumble
off
and
he
gave
another
vigorous
shake
that
made
the
biggest
piece
of
wet
brown
paper
settle
over
his
left
eye
very
well
said
polly
coolly
we
must
go
to
whitney
then
and
tell
her
that
you
are
shaking
off
all
the
brown
paper
i
was
going
to
tell
you
a
story
but
we
can
t
have
it
little
dick
plucked
off
the
big
bit
of
wet
brown
paper
from
his
eye
and
looked
at
her
i
ll
stick
them
on
again
he
said
illustration
little
dick
plucked
off
the
big
bit
of
wet
brown
paper
from
his
eye
very
well
said
polly
once
more
i
ll
put
them
back
that
s
a
good
boy
and
she
proceeded
to
do
so
till
dicky
was
ornamented
with
the
brown
paper
bits
all
in
the
right
places
now
says
i
as
grandma
bascom
used
to
say
we
ll
have
the
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
the
china
i
m
glad
of
that
said
jasper
because
that
was
one
of
the
stories
we
had
on
a
in
the
little
brown
house
do
you
remember
polly
as
if
we
could
ever
forget
cried
polly
happily
and
thereupon
ensued
such
a
do
you
remember
this
and
oh
you
haven
t
forgotten
that
in
the
little
brown
house
that
the
whitney
children
fell
into
despair
and
began
to
implore
that
the
story
might
begin
at
once
you
re
always
talking
of
the
good
times
in
the
little
brown
house
cried
van
who
never
could
forgive
jasper
for
his
good
fortune
in
having
been
there
can
t
help
it
said
jasper
showing
signs
of
rushing
off
again
in
reminiscence
so
polly
hastened
to
say
we
really
ought
not
to
talk
any
more
about
it
but
get
on
with
the
story
well
you
know
the
china
mug
was
china
mug
and
it
stood
on
the
left
corner
of
the
shelf
in
the
kitchen
of
the
little
brown
is
it
a
true
story
clamored
van
oh
you
mustn
t
ask
me
cried
polly
gayly
who
wasn
t
going
to
be
called
from
the
land
of
fancy
just
then
by
any
question
don
t
interrupt
any
of
you
said
jasper
or
i
ll
ask
polly
not
to
tell
about
the
china
mug
you
would
better
keep
still
for
it
s
a
fine
story
i
can
tell
so
van
doubled
himself
up
in
a
ball
on
the
corner
of
the
big
sofa
and
subsided
into
quiet
and
polly
began
once
more
yes
the
china
mug
was
really
and
truly
our
china
mug
on
the
left
corner
of
the
shelf
in
the
kitchen
of
the
little
brown
house
it
was
a
very
old
mug
oh
i
don
t
know
how
many
years
old
two
or
three
hundred
i
guess
for
you
see
it
was
our
father
s
mug
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
his
father
had
it
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
did
they
all
drink
their
milk
from
it
broke
in
little
dick
forgetting
all
about
the
indignity
of
having
his
head
plastered
up
with
bits
of
wet
brown
paper
all
those
little
boys
polly
yes
i
suppose
so
said
polly
for
you
see
they
were
all
called
samuel
and
every
samuel
in
the
family
had
this
mug
so
i
wish
i
could
be
samuel
and
have
a
mug
that
was
in
the
little
brown
house
said
dick
reflectively
well
it
had
a
funny
twisted
handle
said
polly
hurrying
on
and
oh
the
loveliest
lady
with
a
pink
sash
and
long
floating
hair
and
she
had
a
basket
of
roses
on
one
arm
and
she
was
picking
up
her
gown
and
courtesying
just
like
polly
jumped
to
her
feet
and
executed
a
most
remarkable
courtesy
was
she
standing
on
the
handle
asked
percy
who
had
a
fancy
for
all
minute
details
oh
dear
me
no
said
polly
laughing
merrily
and
she
nearly
fell
on
her
nose
as
she
was
just
finishing
the
courtesy
she
couldn
t
stand
on
the
handle
she
was
on
the
front
of
the
china
mug
to
be
sure
and
there
was
a
most
beautiful
little
man
and
he
had
a
cocked
hat
under
his
arm
and
he
was
bowing
to
her
as
she
tell
how
the
beautiful
little
man
bowed
begged
the
children
so
polly
who
had
hopped
into
her
seat
had
to
jump
up
again
and
show
them
just
exactly
how
the
beautiful
little
man
with
the
cocked
hat
under
his
arm
bowed
to
the
lovely
lady
with
a
pink
sash
on
and
a
basket
of
roses
hanging
on
her
arm
then
she
hurried
back
quite
tired
out
to
her
place
illustration
the
beautiful
man
and
the
lovely
lady
on
the
china
mug
he
had
on
a
blue
coat
and
his
hair
was
all
white
and
o
polly
was
he
so
very
old
cried
van
from
his
dear
me
no
said
polly
again
he
was
young
and
most
beautiful
but
his
hair
was
powdered
just
as
the
man
s
is
in
the
big
picture
in
the
and
it
was
tied
up
in
the
back
with
a
bow
of
ribbon
just
like
that
one
too
and
he
had
buckles
on
his
knees
and
on
his
shoes
just
the
very
same
well
he
kept
bowing
and
bowing
all
the
time
and
the
lovely
lady
with
the
pink
sash
on
and
the
basket
of
roses
hanging
on
her
arm
kept
courtesying
to
him
all
the
time
and
they
had
been
doing
that
for
two
or
three
hundred
o
polly
pepper
exclaimed
percy
quite
shocked
how
could
they
bow
and
courtesy
for
two
hundred
years
well
they
did
said
polly
hurrying
on
and
if
you
interrupt
again
out
you
go
from
jasper
and
at
last
one
night
when
we
were
all
abed
mamsie
and
phronsie
and
i
in
the
bedroom
and
the
three
boys
in
the
loft
and
all
of
us
fast
asleep
suddenly
the
beautiful
little
man
exclaimed
i
am
quite
tired
out
bowing
to
you
and
i
am
quite
quite
exhausted
courtesying
to
you
all
the
time
declared
the
lovely
lady
and
i
shall
stop
bowing
and
turn
my
back
on
you
said
the
beautiful
little
man
and
i
shall
not
courtesy
again
but
i
shall
turn
my
back
on
you
said
the
lovely
lady
and
i
shall
walk
away
said
the
beautiful
little
man
and
i
shall
walk
away
from
you
declared
the
lovely
lady
and
so
they
both
whirled
around
and
walked
away
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
from
each
other
and
when
they
got
to
the
funny
twisted
handle
on
the
back
of
the
mug
the
lovely
lady
went
under
it
but
the
beautiful
little
man
hopped
over
it
briskly
and
on
they
both
hurried
and
the
first
thing
either
of
them
knew
there
they
were
on
the
front
of
the
mug
staring
into
each
other
s
faces
as
they
went
by
and
so
round
and
round
the
mug
they
walked
and
they
never
spoke
when
they
went
past
each
other
except
to
say
i
shall
not
bow
to
you
and
i
shall
not
courtesy
to
you
and
then
away
they
went
again
oh
it
was
too
dreadful
to
think
of
and
at
last
they
had
been
going
on
so
around
and
around
oh
two
million
times
i
guess
and
the
lovely
lady
s
poor
little
feet
had
become
so
tired
out
that
she
could
hardly
step
on
them
and
she
sobbed
out
to
herself
she
had
just
passed
the
beautiful
little
man
on
the
front
of
the
mug
so
he
couldn
t
see
her
i
know
i
shall
drop
down
and
die
if
i
keep
on
like
this
so
she
gave
a
great
jump
and
she
flew
clear
over
the
edge
of
the
mug
and
hopped
down
oh
oh
screamed
little
dick
in
a
transport
and
when
the
beautiful
little
man
came
stepping
around
to
the
front
of
the
mug
the
next
time
lo
and
behold
there
was
no
lovely
lady
with
a
basket
of
roses
hanging
on
her
arm
to
say
i
won
t
courtesy
to
how
glad
i
am
that
that
tiresome
creature
has
gone
he
exclaimed
as
he
skipped
off
around
the
mug
and
he
said
it
the
next
time
and
i
don
t
think
he
was
nice
at
all
observed
little
dick
bobbing
his
head
so
decidedly
that
some
of
the
brown
paper
concluded
to
fly
off
at
once
and

after
when

came
to
the
front
once
more
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
bursting
into
tears
and
at
last
he
screamed
right
out

said
polly
and
he
began
to
cry
dreadfully
big
tears
all
over
his
fine
blue
coat
and
his
cocked
hat
and
every
time
before
he
reached
the
front
of
the
mug
he
watched
between
his
sobs
to
see
if
she
had
got
back
and
when
he
found
that
she
hadn
t
he
screamed
worse
than

and
there
she
was
all
huddled
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
mug
said
polly
crying
so
hard
she
could
scarcely
breathe
and
she
tried
to
call
back
to
him
oh
dear
beautiful
little
man
do
come
and
help
me
out
but
her
voice
didn
t
reach
anywhere
for
it
was
such
a
wee
little
squeal
so
on
he
had
to
go
around
and
around
and
she
kept
on
shaking
and
trembling
down
in
the
very
bottom
of
the
the
excitement
among
the
whitney
boys
was
intense
the
little
bunch
of
peppers
and
jasper
preserving
a
smiling
content
knowing
well
what
was
to
become
of
the
lovely
lady
and
the
beautiful
little
man
since
polly
had
told
it
more
than
once
in
the
little
brown
house
do
hurry
and
tell
them
whispered
ben
in
her
ear
so
polly
laughed
and
hastened
on
i
ll
help
you
suddenly
said
a
voice
close
by
on
the
shelf
the
lovely
lady
bobbing
away
in
the
very
bottom
of
the
mug
and
the
beautiful
little
man
crying
his
eyes
out
as
he
walked
around
and
around
the
china
mug
stopped
weeping
and
screaming
to
listen
with
all
their
ears
i
am
sir
declared
the
voice
which
came
out
you
must
know
of
phronsie
s
crockery
dog
that
a
lady
in
the
centre
of
badgertown
gave
her
when
she
was
a
baby
to
cut
her
teeth
on
phronsie
used
to
put
his
head
in
her
mouth
and
bite
hard
and
that
made
her
teeth
come
through
quicker
well
he
was
brown
and
ugly
and
one
ear
was
gone
because
she
had
dropped
him
a
good
many
times
oh
and
two
or
three
of
his
toes
were
broken
off
but
he
was
a
great
help
now
in
this
dreadful
trouble
that
had
overtaken
the
lovely
lady
and
the
beautiful
little
man
because
he
had
a
good
head
to
think
out
i
am
so
glad
phronsie
didn
t
bite
it
off
said
van
with
a
sigh
of
relief
well
go
on
said
percy
briefly
sir
cleared
his
throat
then
he
asked
sharply
are
you
sure
you
won
t
ever
say
such
dreadful
things
as
i
heard
from
you
ever
again
in
all
this
world
oh
quite
quite
sure
said
the
lovely
lady
heaving
a
long
sigh
if
you
will
only
get
me
out
of
this
dismal
place
sir
i
will
be
just
as
good
as
i
can
and
if
you
will
only
bring
back
that
lovely
lady
i
will
be
just
as
good
as
i
can
be
said
the
beautiful
little
man
sir
i
promise
and
they
couldn
t
hear
each
other
only
what
the
brown
crockery
dog
said
and
he
asked
again
are
you
sure
you
won
t
turn
your
backs
on
each
other
but
you
will
bow
and
courtesy
as
prettily
as
you
always
used
to
and
they
both
promised
him
most
solemnly
that
they
would
do
that
very
thing
if
he
would
only
help
them
now
out
of
this
dreadful
dreadful
trouble
so
the
brown
crockery
dog
jumped
up
to
the
top
of
the
funny
twisted
handle
of
the
china
mug
and
sat
there
and
scratched
his
head
very
gravely
and
thought
and
thought
while
the
beautiful
little
man
walked
twice
around
the
china
mug
the
very
thing
at
last
exclaimed
sir
now
then
hurry
lovely
lady
and
he
put
one
of
his
paws
over
the
top
of
the
mug
and
then
peeped
over
can
t
you
reach
up
he
asked
but
the
lovely
lady
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
china
mug
although
she
stood
on
all
her
tip
toes
couldn
t
so
much
as
touch
the
end
of
his
paw
i
shall
die
here
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
huddling
down
in
a
miserable
little
heap
and
beginning
to
weep
again
nonsense
cried
sir
although
he
was
terribly
afraid
that
she
would
i
ll
think
so
he
scratched
his
head
once
more
and
thought
while
the
beautiful
little
man
walked
twice
around
the
china
mug
this
time
i
have
it
declared
the
brown
crockery
dog
and
he
put
his
paw
over
the
edge
of
the
mug
twine
the
roses
in
the
basket
on
your
arm
into
a
vine
and
throw
up
one
end
over
my
paw
and
i
will
pull
you
and
the
lovely
lady
stopped
crying
and
began
to
laugh
all
the
while
she
set
to
work
busily
making
a
vine
out
of
the
roses
in
the
basket
hanging
on
her
arm
and
she
twisted
the
thorns
and
leaves
all
in
and
out
so
nicely
that
before
long
she
had
a
streaming
garland
and
she
threw
up
one
end
of
it
over
the
paw
of
sir
just
as
he
had
told
her
to
do
and
in
a
minute
there
she
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
china
mug
up
by
the
funny
twisted
handle
that
s
fine
cried
sir
so
greatly
pleased
that
he
wanted
to
bark
but
he
didn
t
dare
for
fear
of
scaring
the
beautiful
little
man
who
was
now
approaching
the
funny
twisted
handle
hurry
and
hop
down
o
lovely
lady
and
run
to
your
place
for
here
he
comes
so
the
lovely
lady
hopped
down
and
hurried
with
all
her
might
to
her
old
place
on
the
front
of
the
china
mug
crowding
her
rose
garland
into
the
basket
hanging
on
her
arm
as
she
went
along
and
she
had
just
got
there
and
was
picking
up
her
gown
to
make
a
little
courtesy
when
the
beautiful
little
man
came
up
and
stood
quite
still
i
will
make
you
a
bow
all
the
rest
of
my
life
he
said
bowing
away
as
fast
as
he
could
and
i
will
courtesy
to
you
as
long
as
i
live
she
said
dropping
him
a
most
beautiful
one
and
so
as
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
sir
ran
to
his
end
of
the
shelf
and
stood
up
as
stiff
as
ever
and
that
s
the
way
we
found
them
all
the
next
morning
when
we
got
up
and
went
into
the
kitchen
said
polly
xxiv
brown
betty
whitney
sat
in
her
room
her
soft
hair
floating
over
her
with
little
dick
in
her
arms
just
as
he
had
run
wailing
with
his
story
of
distress
my
throat
isn
t
sore
he
screamed
between
his
tears
and
i
want
to
go
out
with
the
other
polly
running
along
the
hall
with
a
new
book
that
jasper
had
loaned
her
tucked
under
her
arm
a
happy
dancing
before
her
eyes
heard
him
and
stopped
suddenly
then
she
turned
back
and
put
her
brown
head
in
the
doorway
oh
dear
and
she
came
close
to
whitney
s
chair
i
m
not
sick
and
i
want
to
go
out
with
the
boys
roared
dick
worse
than
ever
i
want
to
go
out
i
want
to
go
i
suppose
that
s
just
what
brown
betty
cried
said
polly
saying
the
first
thing
that
popped
into
her
head
of
all
the
stories
she
used
to
tell
in
the
little
brown
house
eh
little
dick
lifted
his
head
from
the
nest
where
he
had
burrowed
under
his
mother
s
soft
hair
and
regarded
her
closely
through
his
tears
polly
knelt
down
by
whitney
s
side
and
turned
her
back
on
jasper
s
new
book
where
she
laid
it
on
the
floor
you
don
t
know
how
brown
betty
wanted
to
get
out
she
said
but
she
couldn
t
do
it
not
a
bit
of
why
not
demanded
dick
suddenly
and
edging
along
on
his
mother
s
lap
to
look
into
polly
s
eyes
why
couldn
t
she
get
out
polly
why
because
she
fell
in
said
polly
shaking
her
brown
head
sadly
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
out
no
matter
how
much
she
cried
so
she
made
up
her
mind
not
to
cry
at
didn
t
she
cry
a
teenty
wee
bit
asked
little
dick
trying
to
wipe
away
the
drops
on
his
cheeks
with
his
chubby
hand
not
a
single
bit
of
a
tear
said
polly
decidedly
what
was
the
use
it
wouldn
t
help
her
to
get
out
you
see
it
was
just
this
way
she
was
hurrying
down
the
garden
path
just
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
carry
her
and
she
had
a
big
bundle
in
her
mouth
in
her
mouth
repeated
little
dick
in
astonishment
and
slipping
from
his
mother
s
lap
he
cuddled
on
the
floor
beside
polly
and
folded
his
small
hands
yes
in
her
mouth
said
polly
merrily
oh
didn
t
i
tell
you
brown
betty
was
a
dear
little
bug
just
as
brown
as
could
be
and
the
bundle
in
her
mouth
was
a
piece
of
a
dead
fly
she
was
taking
home
for
her
children
s
oh
said
dick
tell
me
whitney
slipped
out
of
her
chair
to
finish
her
dressing
first
pausing
to
pat
polly
s
brown
hair
so
you
see
poor
brown
betty
couldn
t
look
very
well
where
she
was
going
for
the
piece
of
a
dead
fly
stuck
out
in
front
of
her
eyes
so
far
that
the
first
thing
she
knew
down
she
went
down
down
down
and
she
never
stopped
till
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
black
o
polly
exclaimed
little
dick
in
dismay
yes
said
polly
and
there
she
was
and
she
couldn
t
speak
for
a
minute
for
she
had
come
so
far
and
so
fast
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
catch
her
breath
so
the
black
creatures
ran
around
and
around
her
in
great
glee
and
every
one
of
them
said
how
very
nice
and
fat
you
are
now
we
ll
eat
you
o
polly
cried
little
dick
again
and
snuggling
up
closer
didn
t
she
cry
no
said
polly
she
didn
t
because
you
see
it
wouldn
t
have
done
any
good
she
d
got
to
think
up
things
how
to
get
out
and
all
that
you
know
so
there
wasn
t
any
time
to
cry
and
she
spoke
up
just
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
her
breath
oh
what
a
wonderful
place
is
this
and
she
rolled
her
little
bits
of
eyes
all
around
and
the
ants
said
oh
were
the
hundreds
of
black
creatures
ants
asked
little
dick
yes
indeed
oh
didn
t
i
tell
you
cried
polly
all
in
one
breath
they
were
dear
little
black
ants
and
the
deep
deep
place
that
brown
betty
tumbled
into
when
she
was
carrying
home
the
piece
of
a
dead
fly
was
their
house
and
when
she
said
oh
what
a
wonderful
place
is
this
they
were
all
very
much
pleased
and
they
ran
around
and
around
her
faster
than
ever
all
talking
together
and
they
said
she
seems
to
be
very
wise
it
s
a
pity
to
eat
her
just
now
we
will
wait
and
let
her
tell
us
things
and
brown
betty
heard
them
say
that
as
they
were
all
running
around
and
around
her
for
you
see
when
she
made
up
her
mind
not
to
cry
she
thought
she
would
better
keep
her
ears
open
as
well
as
her
eyes
and
find
out
some
way
to
what
s
escape
interrupted
little
dick
oh
to
get
out
so
they
wouldn
t
eat
her
up
said
polly
well
and
so
when
she
heard
them
say
that
why
brown
betty
thought
of
something
else
that
would
give
her
more
time
to
think
up
things
how
to
get
away
and
she
said
oh
if
i
might
only
see
some
of
the
splendid
places
you
ve
got
in
your
house
i
should
be
so
happy
for
you
see
she
had
heard
how
the
ants
build
great
long
halls
and
rooms
and
ever
so
many
nooks
and
crannies
and
the
big
ant
that
made
them
all
mind
everything
she
said
heard
her
say
it
because
brown
betty
called
it
as
out
loud
as
she
could
and
so
the
big
ant
spoke
up
and
ordered
a
company
of
a
hundred
ants
to
get
into
o
polly
a
hundred
ants
cried
little
dick
with
an
absorbed
face
illustration
o
polly
a
hundred
ants
cried
little
dick
with
an
absorbed
face
yes
indeed
that
s
nothing
said
polly
sometimes
they
had
a
thousand
march
off
somewhere
wherever
the
big
queen
ant
would
tell
them
to
go
well
these
hundred
ran
right
around
brown
betty
and
got
her
in
the
middle
now
go
and
show
her
the
long
corridor
said
the
big
mother
you
said
she
was
the
queen
ant
corrected
dick
yes
so
she
was
and
the
mother
ant
too
said
polly
but
i
like
that
best
so
i
m
going
to
call
her
so
well
polly
said
little
dick
hastily
i
very
much
wish
you
d
call
her
captain
well
i
will
said
polly
bursting
into
a
merry
laugh
that
made
whitney
smile
too
a
smile
that
went
right
down
into
polly
s
heart
and
made
her
forget
all
about
jasper
s
new
book
lying
there
on
the
floor
now
she
s
captain
ant
we
mustn
t
forget
that
we
mustn
t
forget
that
repeated
dick
in
great
satisfaction
now
go
on
polly
so
the
company
of
a
hundred
ants
went
off
just
as
captain
ant
had
told
them
to
show
brown
betty
the
long
what
s
a
long
cor
what
is
that
word
polly
corridor
oh
that
s
a
great
long
hall
ever
and
ever
so
long
said
polly
and
it
was
broad
and
splendid
and
the
walls
were
as
smooth
as
a
board
and
the
top
was
just
as
smooth
too
and
out
of
it
ran
different
rooms
and
nooks
and
crannies
and
funny
little
places
so
when
brown
betty
heard
captain
ant
command
them
to
show
her
the
long
corridor
she
began
to
set
her
busy
little
head
to
thinking
that
perhaps
she
might
steal
away
from
them
and
hide
somewhere
in
one
of
these
queer
little
and
did
she
cried
little
dick
eagerly
oh
i
can
t
tell
you
now
said
polly
wait
and
see
well
off
they
went
down
the
long
corridor
with
the
smooth
dirt
walls
and
you
said
it
was
board
corrected
little
dick
oh
no
dicky
said
polly
i
said
it
was
as
smooth
as
a
board
but
they
were
all
made
of
dirt
dirt
walls
and
everything
was
all
polished
off
by
the
ants
till
it
was
straight
and
high
and
splendid
well
off
they
went
what
a
perfectly
remarkable
place
cried
brown
betty
rolling
up
her
little
bits
of
eyes
at
everything
as
they
marched
her
along
in
the
middle
which
pleased
them
very
much
so
they
let
her
drop
behind
the
procession
once
in
a
while
to
admire
something
or
oh
now
she
is
going
to
run
away
i
know
said
dick
in
great
excitement
oh
she
can
t
get
away
yet
said
polly
you
wait
and
see
dicky
just
then
while
she
was
hanging
back
from
the
rest
of
the
company
for
they
were
all
talking
together
as
they
ran
around
and
around
and
saying
how
extremely
wise
she
was
and
what
a
pity
it
was
that
they
had
got
to
eat
her
up
after
they
had
shown
her
all
about
she
heard
a
little
noise
you
see
she
was
peering
into
a
little
what
s
a
cranny
asked
dick
abruptly
oh
a
little
place
in
the
wall
said
polly
well
she
was
peering
in
there
and
wondering
if
she
could
slip
in
when
the
hundred
ants
weren
t
looking
when
she
heard
this
little
what
was
it
asked
dick
getting
as
close
to
polly
as
he
could
you
ll
see
and
then
as
she
peered
in
she
saw
another
brown
bug
just
like
herself
only
bigger
chained
to
the
side
of
the
wall
so
she
couldn
t
get
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
dick
how
big
was
the
chain
oh
it
wasn
t
big
at
all
said
polly
how
could
it
be
to
fasten
up
that
wee
brown
bug
it
was
all
made
of
the
hairs
of
the
black
spiders
dropped
in
the
garden
where
the
ant
house
was
and
the
ants
had
twisted
them
together
and
made
chains
to
tie
up
their
prisoners
oh
said
dicky
drawing
a
long
breath
and
was
she
tied
up
tight
oh
just
as
tight
said
polly
the
chain
went
all
around
her
leg
and
over
her
neck
and
there
she
was
sobbing
away
as
if
her
heart
would
what
made
her
cry
asked
dick
why
didn
t
she
think
up
things
how
to
get
away
just
like
your
brown
bug
polly
and
he
drew
himself
up
with
the
determination
to
be
like
brown
betty
well
you
see
she
didn
t
said
polly
that
s
just
the
difference
so
there
she
was
chained
to
the
wall
of
that
cranny
they
re
waiting
till
i
get
fat
enough
said
this
poor
creature
to
brown
betty
then
they
ll
eat
me
i
heard
them
say
now
brown
betty
couldn
t
act
as
if
she
heard
anything
you
know
for
all
those
hundred
ants
would
pounce
on
them
both
and
cut
their
heads
off
maybe
so
she
said
hush
and
i
ll
try
to
save
you
then
she
hurried
off
to
the
company
now
show
me
something
more
wonderful
yet
she
said
we
ll
show
her
the
hall
of
justice
said
the
ants
one
to
what
is
that
polly
asked
little
dick
oh
you
ll
see
the
ants
are
going
to
tell
brown
betty
all
about
it
then
you
ll
know
well
so
off
they
went
and
by
this
time
they
thought
so
much
of
brown
betty
s
wisdom
for
they
were
all
talking
of
it
together
that
they
got
very
careless
about
keeping
her
in
the
middle
but
they
let
her
wander
at
the
end
of
the
procession
and
stop
when
she
wanted
to
admire
anything
very
illustration
brown
betty
and
the
ants
oh
now
i
know
that
she
is
going
to
run
away
exclaimed
little
dick
striking
his
hands
together
in
great
delight
and
at
last
there
they
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
great
hall
of
justice
brown
betty
just
blinked
her
eyes
she
was
so
afraid
she
should
cry
when
the
ants
all
screamed
out
together
we
try
our
prisoners
here
before
we
eat
them
but
she
pretended
she
didn
t
care
and
she
said
what
s
that
big
chair
up
there
pointing
to
the
end
of
the
long
room
that
is
not
a
chair
said
the
ants
all
together
that
is
the
what
s
a
throne
asked
brown
betty
to
gain
time
to
think
out
things
by
keeping
them
talking
besides
she
was
trembling
so
with
fright
that
her
poor
little
knees
knocked
together
and
she
had
to
say
something
or
she
would
have
dropped
in
a
dead
faint
oh
oh
so
wise
a
creature
not
to
know
what
a
throne
is
exclaimed
all
the
ants
together
in
astonishment
and
they
ran
around
and
around
worse
than
ever
till
poor
brown
betty
s
head
spun
to
see
them
go
they
made
her
so
giddy
it
s
where
the
queen
ant
sits
to
you
said
you
d
call
her
captain
ant
broke
in
dick
oh
yes
so
i
did
well
captain
ant
corrected
polly
well
it
s
where
the
captain
sits
said
the
ants
all
together
still
running
around
and
around
to
try
the
oh
said
brown
betty
her
poor
knees
knocking
together
worse
than
ever
then
she
managed
to
pick
up
courage
to
ask
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
how
does
she
try
them
one
of
the
hundred
ants
ran
out
from
the
company
and
close
up
to
brown
betty
she
is
so
wise
he
said
to
himself
i
want
to
show
her
that
i
am
wise
so
he
hurried
up
to
her
side
do
you
see
that
sword
hanging
up
there
he
whispered
and
the
other
ants
were
all
talking
together
and
running
about
so
they
didn
t
hear
him
where
asked
brown
betty
peering
up
above
the
throne
i
see
of
course
said
the
ant
who
wanted
to
show
how
wise
he
was
and
he
laughed
softly
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
could
tell
her
something
new
you
can
t
see
it
till
i
tell
you
where
it
is
so
i
am
wiser
than
you
well
when
the
queen
has
that
in
her
hand
she
can
do
anything
she
pleases
it
all
comes
to
pass
it
hangs
just
back
of
the
throne
at
the
top
now
don
t
you
think
i
am
wise
brown
betty
s
heart
gave
a
great
jump
oh
sir
she
cried
what
a
wonderful
creature
you
are
which
so
delighted
the
ant
that
he
ran
round
and
round
her
sixty
times
without
stopping
talking
to
himself
all
the
while
she
says
i
m
a
wonderful
all
this
time
brown
betty
was
thinking
how
she
could
get
up
into
that
throne
and
presently
she
said
as
loud
as
she
could
one
of
the
most
wonderful
places
that
ever
i
was
in
is
this
very
spot
but
i
must
sit
on
that
throne
before
i
can
say
it
is
most
wonderful
place
she
added
boldly
while
her
poor
knees
shook
and
knocked
so
together
she
thought
she
should
die
she
must
say
it
is
most
wonderful
place
she
was
ever
in
declared
the
company
of
ants
in
consternation
else
captain
ant
will
have
our
heads
off
when
we
carry
her
back
and
they
ran
round
and
round
her
worse
than
ever
saying
this
over
all
the
time
at
last
they
all
stopped
and
swarmed
around
her
keeping
her
in
the
middle
will
you
say
this
is
most
wonderful
place
i
was
ever
in
if
we
let
you
get
up
in
the
throne
they
cried
at
her
i
will
promised
brown
betty
as
quick
as
a
flash
so
they
opened
their
ranks
and
before
she
could
think
twice
there
she
was
up
in
the
throne
and
looking
down
into
their
faces
but
how
to
get
hold
of
the
sword
she
didn
t
o
polly
do

her
get
that
sword
cried
little
dick
in
great
distress
please

her
how
please
hurry
polly
and
show
her
how
and
there
she
was
looking
down
into
their
faces
and
she
knew
she
must
hurry
and
say
the
words
she
had
promised
and
then
get
down
and
she
was
at
her
wits
end
to
know
what
to
please
hurry
and
show
her
how
quick
begged
little
dick
his
knees
knocking
together
what
a
wonderful
top
to
that
throne
cried
brown
betty
i
must
see
that
first
and
as
quickly
as
she
said
the
words
up
she
ran
with
all
speed
to
the
very
tip
of
the
throne
spread
over
her
head
the
wise
ant
who
had
told
her
of
the
sword
just
then
screamed
out
hold
her
back
but
it
was
too
late
brown
betty
s
little
bits
of
eyes
were
keen
and
sharp
there
was
the
sword
hanging
before
her
and
in
a
second
it
was
in
her
mouth
and
she
was
waving
it
over
the
hundred
ants
stop
where
you
are
she
screamed
at
them
or
i
ll
cut
your
heads
off
and
not
a
single
ant
she
killed
them
all
she
killed
them
piped
dicky
in
the
most
joyful
tone
and
springing
to
his
feet
he
danced
all
over
the
singing
brown
betty
killed
them
all
oh
no
she
didn
t
said
polly
as
soon
as
she
could
make
herself
heard
she
didn
t
kill
them
exclaimed
little
dick
coming
to
a
dead
stop
in
amazement
oh
no
of
course
not
said
polly
brown
betty
wouldn
t
do
such
a
cruel
thing
if
she
could
get
away
and
help
the
other
brown
bug
off
without
hurting
them
she
just
slipped
down
from
the
throne
waving
her
sword
at
them
and
telling
them
she
would
cut
their
heads
off
if
they
stirred
but
they
couldn
t
you
know
then
she
slammed
the
door
of
the
hall
of
justice
tight
to
and
locked
them
all
that
was
worse
said
dicky
coming
up
quite
close
to
her
oh
some
of
the
other
ants
would
come
by
and
by
to
look
for
them
said
polly
comfortingly
and
let
them
out
so
down
the
long
corridor
she
ran
with
the
captain
s
sword
in
her
mouth
till
she
reached
the
cranny
where
the
other
brown
bug
was
tied

she
commanded
and
with
one
flash
of
the
sword
she
snipped
the
chain
everywhere

was
fastened
now
come
on
and
she
dragged
the
prisoner
out
and
away
they
went
brown
betty
waving
the
sword
high
for
she
didn
t
know
when
she
would
meet
any
ants
and
she
must
be
ready
to
keep
them
off

her
into

and
out
into
the
long
corridor
they

and
ran
like
lightning
and
then
after
awhile
turn
she
said
i
heard
them
say
that
they
had
built
a
secret
way
and
there
was
a
little
narrow
slit
of
a
way
down
which
they
turned
and
they
turned
and
they
turned
till
finally
after
they
had
got
through
turning
all
of
a
sudden
out
it
came
into
the
green
grass
and

the
other
brown
and

phronsie
getting

on
the
and
she
quickly
brought
it
up
in
her
hand
oh

s
good
exclaimed
polly
in
great
satisfaction
with
one
eye
on
the
french
mantel
clock
now
if

hunt
for
that
tiresome
pink
silk
the
whole
quarter
of

hour

and
i
must
try
this
rosebud
to
show
to
auntie
she
seized
her
embroidery
work
huddling
up
silks
and
thimble
and
all
and
ran
to
ensconce
herself
in
a
cosey
corner
of
the
library
sofa
humming
softly
to
herself
the
last
piece
of
music
monsieur
had
given
to
her
i
might
have
a
of
the
silly
little
brook
said
phronsie
standing
quite
still
by
the
table
what
is
it
cried
polly
coming
out
from
the
trills
and
runs
to
stare
at
her
oh
that
story
i
forgot
all
about
it
phronsie
yes

and
a
remorseful
wave
made
her
cheek
rosy
red
i
m
a
selfish
little
pig
phronsie
come
over
and
i
ll
tell
it
right
you
re
not
a
little
pig
said
phronsie
hurrying
over
to
the
sofa
to
tuck
herself
away
in
a
blissful
frame
of
mind
close
to
polly
and
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
tell
it
and
please
begin
right
off
polly
all
in
one
breath
yes
indeed
i
will
said
polly
with
a
sorry
little
twinge
for
the
minutes
lost
well
you
know
the
silly
little
brook
was
not
our
cherry
brook
she
began
well
knowing
that
fact
must
usher
in
the
story
it
was
not
our
cherry
brook
repeated
phronsie
distinctly
and
smoothing
down
her
white
apron
because
our
cherry
brook
was
a
nice
brook
and
didn
t
do
silly
that
s
so
assented
polly
wondering
if
she
was
making
her
rosebud
pink
enough
well
one
day
quite
early
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
was
peeping
over
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
tell
how
he
peeped
over
please
polly
begged
phronsie
who
dearly
loved
to
have
polly
act
out
her
stories
so
polly
laid
down
her
rosebud
thimble
and
all
in
phronsie
s
lap
and
got
up
and
told
it
over
again
to
phronsie
s
intense
satisfaction
then
she
hopped
back
to
her
embroidery
work
and
at
the
same
time
the
silly
little
brook
awoke
and
opened
its
eyes
to
the
sun
and
the
world
oh
how
do
you
do
said
the
sun
laughing
as
the
silly
little
brook
blinked
its
eyes
at
him
who
are
you
asked
the
silly
little
brook
i
never
saw
you
of
course
not
said
the
sun
laughing
worse
than
ever
because
you
have
never
been
awake
before
come
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
get
to
work
you
ve
been
a
long
time
asleep
look
back
of
the
silly
little
brook
did
just
as
the
sun
told
her
and
looked
back
of
her
i
don
t
see
anything
she
said
except
a
black
hole
in
the
of
course
you
don
t
said
the
sun
because
that
s
all
there
is
to
see
you
ve
just
come
out
of
that
hole
where
you
ve
been
asleep
all
your
life
now
look
ahead
the
sun
said
this
so
loud
and
stared
at
her
face
so
long
that
the
silly
little
brook
began
to
feel
quite
uncomfortable
so
she
winked
and
blinked
and
said
nothing
look
ahead
commanded
the
sun
sharply
oh
you
silly
stupid
little
thing
and
this
time
she
obeyed
and
there
was
a
tiny
wee
little
stream
of
clear
white
water
trickling
away
like
a
thread
down
the
it
was
the
silly
little
brook
cried
phronsie
clapping
her
hands
in
glee
just
as
if
she
hadn
t
heard
the
story
time
and
again
yes
said
polly
bobbing
her
head
and
setting
in
quick
stitches
so
it
was
now
hurry
up
said
the
sun
by
this
time
he
was
very
fierce
for
his
face
had
been
getting
rounder
and
bigger
every
minute
and
set
to
work
for
you
have
a
great
deal
to
do
be
a
useful
little
brook
and
don
t
stop
on
your
way
and
i
shall
be
glad
that
you
woke
up
and
the
silly
little
brook
felt
her
feet
give
way
before
her
and
in
a
minute
she
was
slipping
and
sliding
down
down
the
mountain
side
i
m
not
going
to
be
sent
down
in
this
fashion
she
grumbled
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
her
breath
while
she
rested
a
bit
in
a
hollow
i
shall
choose
my
way
and
what
i
ll
do
and
i
m
not
going
to
work
all
the
time
either
and
that
cross
old
sun
needn
t
think
he
can
command
me
to
do
it
i
m
going
to
play
as
much
as
i
want
with
that
she
rested
in
the
hollow
all
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
phronsie
shook
her
yellow
head
mournfully
as
one
who
knows
a
sorrowful
tale
too
well
illustration
phronsie
shook
her
yellow
head
mournfully
the
first
day
said
polly
hurrying
on
the
birds
came
to
see
the
silly
little
brook
and
they
sang
sweet
songs
over
her
head
and
they
told
her
pretty
stories
and
they
dipped
their
beaks
in
her
clear
little
pool
of
water
in
the
hollow
and
the
silly
little
brook
said
to
herself
oh
what
a
lovely
time
this
is
how
good
it
was
for
me
that
i
didn
t
mind
what
the
cross
old
sun
said
to
me
when
he
told
me
not
to
stop
forsooth
i
shall
stop
here
as
long
as
i
want
what
does
for
what
is
it
polly
mean
asked
phronsie
who
always
asked
this
question
at
this
particular
stage
of
the
story
oh
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
said
polly
carelessly
then
why
did
she
say
it
persisted
phronsie
oh
because
it
sounded
nice
said
polly
twitching
her
pink
silk
thread
out
to
replace
it
with
a
green
one
to
begin
on
the
calyx
people
have
to
say
things
sometimes
that
don
t
mean
anything
in
a
do
they
said
phronsie
with
wondering
eyes
well
she
did
any
way
said
polly
so
she
said
forsooth
and
tossed
her
head
and
immediately
she
felt
very
big
and
grand
and
the
next
day
the
birds
came
and
everything
was
lovely
and
the
silly
little
brook
went
to
sleep
at
night
and
dreamed
of
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
but
the
day
after
she
looked
up
and
saw
to
her
astonishment
a
flock
of
birds
that
was
whirring
along
over
the
tip
of
the
pause
when
they
got
to
her
and
look
down
then
they
whispered
together
and
presently
off
they
flew
chattering
oh
no
no
we
ll
not
stop
there
what
to
make
of
it
the
silly
little
brook
did
not
know
she
only
tossed
her
head
and
grew
angrier
and
angrier
and
said
she
didn
t
care
but
she
went
to
sleep
sobbing
as
hard
as
she
could
that
night
and
her
pillow
a
clump
of
moss
was
wet
with
phronsie
moved
uneasily
but
said
not
a
word
at
last
as
morning
broke
the
silly
little
brook
heard
a
voice
close
to
her
ear
say
o
dear
brook
wake
up
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
there
was
robin
i
am
so
glad
he
has
come
polly
ejaculated
phronsie
in
relief
the
silly
little
brook
at
that
opened
her
eyes
what
is
it
she
asked
sadly
don
t
you
know
why
the
birds
are
flying
over
your
head
to
seek
other
streams
without
so
much
as
giving
you
a
gentle
word
and
no
one
remains
to
tell
you
the
truth
but
me
asked
robin
no
i
don
t
said
the
silly
little
brook
tell
me
look
for
yourself
said
robin
redbreast
so
the
silly
little
brook
turned
her
eyes
to
look
at
herself
in
the
little
hollow
where
she
had
rested
and
lo
and
behold
instead
of
the
clear
white
water
with
the
shade
just
like
the
violets
in
our
woods
at
badgertown
you
know
phronsie
and
polly
s
hands
with
their
work
dropped
to
her
lap
why
yes
yes
i
know
said
phronsie
with
a
small
sigh
hearing
which
polly
picked
up
her
work
again
and
hurried
on
why
there
was
a
dark
dirty
pool
of
water
with
a
little
green
scum
coming
all
over
the
top
of
it
oh
horrors
screamed
the
silly
little
brook
why
where
have
i
gone
that
isn
t
my
little
yes
it
is
said
robin
shaking
his
head
sadly
you
re
turned
into
this
hateful
thing
because
you
staid
still
o
dear
brook
why
didn
t
you
obey
the
good
sun
and
go
on
i
will
now
said
the
silly
little
brook
bursting
into
a
torrent
of
tears
and
she
tried
to
start
but
her
feet
were
all
tangled
up
in
a
mess
of
leaves
and
green
things
that
weren
t
nice
and
she
couldn
t
stir
a
phronsie
here
moved
uneasily
again
but
waited
for
polly
to
go
on
i
ll
help
you
said
robin
redbreast
quickly
and
jumping
down
he
picked
patiently
all
the
sticks
and
leaves
he
could
in
his
bill
and
carried
them
out
of
the
way
of
the
silly
little
brook
when
she
should
once
more
start
to
run
down
the
he
was
a
nice
robin
redbreast
polly
and
i
like
him
phronsie
exclaimed
joyfully
so
he
was
pet
polly
made
haste
to
answer
well
but
as
fast
as
he
picked
off
the
leaves
and
sticks
out
of
the
way
of
the
silly
little
brook
ever
so
many
others
would
come
blowing
down
on
her
from
the
trees
and
choke
up
the
path
again
so
at
last
poor
robin
redbreast
had
to
sit
down
quite
tired
out
and
declare
he
could
do
no
please
hurry
and
tell
it
polly
begged
phronsie
pulling
her
sleeve
for
polly
dearly
loved
to
stop
a
bit
in
the
most
impressive
spots
well
and
then
the
silly
little
brook
began
to
sob
and
to
scream
louder
than
ever
and
the
sticks
and
leaves
flew
around
her
thick
and
fast
for
it
was
a
very
windy
day
and
the
birds
flew
over
her
head
never
so
much
as
giving
her
a
glance
and
it
was
very
dreadful
indeed
said
polly
holding
up
her
embroidery
at
arm
s
length
to
see
if
the
calyx
was
beginning
to
look
exactly
as
if
the
rosebud
were
just
picked
from
the
garden
please
hurry
begged
phronsie
pulling
her
sleeve
again
so
i
will
said
polly
i
think
that
is
just
as
near
right
as
i
can
get
it
although
it
doesn
t
look
like
a
real
rose
she
sighed
but
you
must
let
me
stop
once
in
a
while
child
for
the
story
sounds
but
i
want
the
silly
little
brook
to
stop
crying
and
get
out
said
phronsie
in
gentle
haste
well
so
i
will
let
her
out
you
ll
see
promised
polly
hurrying
on
to
set
in
more
green
stitches
determined
since
she
couldn
t
make
it
like
a
real
rose
from
grandpapa
s
garden
she
would
have
it
as
good
a
one
as
possible
i
shall
die
here
mourned
the
silly
little
brook
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
sobbed
over
her
she
will
die
there
until
robin
redbreast
let
his
head
droop
on
his
pretty
red
please
hurry
polly
said
phronsie
pleadingly
and
there
were
tears
in
the
brown
eyes
but
suddenly
up
jumped
robin
cried
polly
casting
aside
her
embroidery
on
the
sofa
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
waved
her
arms
and
he
trilled
out
loud
and
clear
while
he
flapped
his
wings
stop
your
crying
dear
brook
i
will
go
and
bring
some
help
for
he
had
heard
what
the
silly
little
brook
had
not
been
able
to
hear
as
she
was
weeping
so
hard
the
notes
way
up
in
the
sky
of
some
little
birds
that
he
polly
exclaimed
phronsie
in
great
excitement
and
slipping
from
the
sofa
to
plant
herself
in
front
of
polly
still
waving
her
arms
and
crying
stop
your
crying
dear
brook
i
will
go
and
bring
some
help
i
love
that
robin
redbreast
i
well
we
must
get
back
to
the
sofa
and
finish
this
story
or
mamsie
ll
call
us
before
we
re
ready
laughed
polly
her
arms
tumbling
to
her
sides
and
she
picked
up
phronsie
and
in
a
minute
there
they
were
in
the
cosey
corner
once
more
so
off
he
flew
hurried
on
polly
picking
up
her
needle
once
more
to
set
quick
stitches
and
oh
as
soon
as
you
could
think
back
he
came
and
a
whole
troop
of
robin
redbreasts
who
were
on
a
journey
together
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
they
picked
out
every
stick
and
leaf
before
the
new
ones
had
a
chance
to
choke
up
the
way
and
pretty
soon
start
now
they
said
and
the
silly
little
brook
put
out
her
feet
and
away
she
went
slipping
and
sliding
and
trickling
and
running
like
a
mad
little
thing
down
the
illustration
the
birds
and
the
silly
little
brook
phronsie
clapped
her
hands
and
shouted
in
glee
don
t
stop
again
screamed
every
one
of
those
robin
redbreasts
after
her
but
go
on
and
on
and
pol
called
mamsie
over
the
stairs
and
phron
it
s
time
to
go
down
town
to
buy
your
xxvi
down
in
the
orchard
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
have
an
orchard
said
polly
clasping
her
hands
in
delight
at
the
remembrance
you
can
t
think
and
we
used
to
have
such
fun
out
there
when
the
work
was
done
up
how
many
trees
were
there
asked
percy
with
an
eye
for
details
oh
there
weren
t
any
said
polly
quickly
there
was
just
one
but
we
played
there
were
ever
and
ever
so
many
so
we
called
it
an
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
percy
and
van
together
it
was
an
said
joel
and
there
weren
t
any
apples
on
it
either
only
we
used
to
play
there
o
joel
exclaimed
polly
have
you
forgotten
don
t
you
remember
one
year
that

got
some
mean
old
things
declared
joel
and
so
hard
they
d
almost
break
your
well
you
and
dave
managed
to
eat
them
said
ben
laughing
because
we
couldn
t
get
any
others
said
joel
and
they
were
only
about
a
dozen
of
them
i
that
was
better
than
nothing
said
polly
well
you
see
we
did
have
apples
on
the
tree
sometimes
so
we
could
call
it
an
orchard
and
when
we
had
our
work
done
we
could
go
out
there
and
play
and
phronsie
could
always
take
seraphina
and
stay
there
ever
so
long
because
it
was
just
a
little
way
back
of
the
so
you
see
we
thought
a
great
deal
indeed
of
our
tell
us
what
you
used
to
do
out
in
your
orchard
begged
van
abruptly
every
single
oh

me
said
polly
drawing
a
long
breath
at
the
delightful
remembrances
i
can
t
tell
you
all
the
things
we
used
to
do
there
any
more
than
i
can
about
all
the
good
times
we
had
in
the
dear
old
there
s
no
use
in
asking
the
peppers
to
tell
all
the
good
times
they
had
in
the
little
brown
house
declared
jasper
with
kindling
eyes
because
you
see
they
just
can
t
do
it
i
know
because
i
ve
been
jappy
always
feels
so
smart
because
he
s
been
at
the
little
brown
house
exclaimed
van
enviously
well
why
shouldn
t
i
retorted
jasper
gayly
it
s
something
to
feel
smart
over
i
can
tell
you
to
go
to
the
little
brown
i
wish
we
could
ever
go
there
said
percy
wishfully
well
if
you
want
to
hear
polly
tell
of
what
we
did
down
in
our
orchard
you
would
better
stop
talking
and
let
her
begin
advised
ben
i
think
so
too
laughed
jasper
i
m
as
bad
as
the
rest
but
when
it
comes
to
talking
about
the
little
brown
house
why
i
just
forget
and
pitch
in
now
do
go
on
polly
we
beg
your
pardon
and
he
shook
his
head
at
the
other
boys
yes
we
do
beg
your
pardon
percy
and
van
made
haste
to
say
seeing
that
jasper
had
said
it
first
all
right
said
polly
then
i
ll
begin
straight
off
to
tell
you
of
one
nice
time
we
had
down
in
our
orchard
you
see
mamsie
was
off
at
the
minister
s
house
helping
to
make
over
the
parlor
carpet
and
we
really
hadn
t
any
work
to
do
and
for
a
wonder
ben
was
home
because
there
was
no
wood
for
him
to
chop
anywhere
and
it
was
a
long
hot
summer
afternoon
first
we
thought
we
d
go
off
to
the
woods
and
and
why
didn
t
you
broke
in
van
with
wide
eyes
for
the
indifference
to
the
charms
of
the
woods
hush
said
jasper
holding
up
his
hand
percy
was
just
going
to
say
i
should
think
you
d
have
gone
to
the
woods
and
dug
up
moss
and
flowers
and
cunning
little
but
hearing
jasper
s
hush
he
ducked
involuntarily
very
glad
he
hadn
t
spoken
oh
phronsie
wasn
t
very
well
said
polly
that
is
she
hadn
t
been
and
we
knew
mamsie
wouldn
t
want
her
to
walk
so
far
and
besides
it
was
just
as
much
fun
to
play
in
our
orchard
so
we
all
decided
to
go
there
well
off
we
started
why
i
thought
you
said
it
was
just
a
little
way
back
of
the
said
percy
surprised
out
of
himself
so
it
was
answered
polly
but
we
played
it
was
ever
so
far
off
and
we
walked
around
and
around
the
little
brown
house
all
but
phronsie
she
sat
on
the
till
we
were
ready
to
go
into
the
orchard
then
she
got
down
and
we
all
went
in
together
said
polly
with
a
grand
flourish
as
if
escorting
her
auditors
into
enchanted
space
big
beyond
description
well
and
don
t
you
think
there
was
the
greatest
surprise
when
we
got
there
oh
tell
us
begged
all
the
whitney
boys
impatiently
why
ben
had
run
off
after
we
had
talked
over
whether
we
would
go
to
the
woods
or
not
and
we
didn
t
think
we
ought
to
for
mamsie
wouldn
t
like
to
have
phronsie
walk
so
far
and
he
had
brought
back
some
flowers
and
some
moss
and
ever
so
many
that
s
nice
said
percy
in
a
satisfied
way
and
there
they
were
on
the
little
stone
table
said
polly
oh
did
you
have
a
stone
table
in
your
orchard
asked
van
yes
i
ve
seen
it
ever
so
many
times
said
jasper
then
he
pulled
himself
up
laughing
beg
pardon
ho
ho
you
re
talking
cried
van
at
him
can
t
help
it
said
jasper
recklessly
when
you
begin
to
ask
about
the
good
times
in
the
little
brown
house
i
must
you
see
said
polly
to
the
whitney
boys
we
had
to
have
a
table
for
our
and
ever
so
many
other
things
and
so
ben
chose
a
big
stone
in
a
field
it
was
deacon
brown
s
meadow
and
he
you
said
it
was
a
field
polly
pepper
interrupted
percy
in
his
most
literal
way
well
it
was
just
about
the
same
thing
said
polly
laughing
never
mind
him
polly
said
jasper
and
you
never
will
get
this
story
if
you
keep
stopping
her
all
the
time
from
ben
so
polly
hurried
on
and
deacon
brown
was
just
as
glad
as
he
could
be
of
course
to
have
that
big
stone
carried
off
from
his
why
asked
van
i
should
think
all
the
brown
children
would
have
wanted
it
to
play
oh
there
are
such
oceans
of
stones
in
badgertown
cried
polly
lifting
her
hands
o
polly
exclaimed
ben
of
stones
well
i
mean
such
a
very
very
great
many
said
polly
with
the
color
flooding
her
face
you
can
t
think
boys
and
they
bother
the
farmers
dreadfully
when
they
want
to
cut
their
grass
the
poor
cows
have
such
hard
work
to
get
their
noses
in
between
them
the
stones
i
mean
in
order
to
get
anything
to
the
farmers
almost
have
to
whittle
off
the
cows
noses
for
them
to
get
a
bite
said
ben
and
joel
and
david
would
pick
rocks
for
the
farmers
sometimes
said
polly
but
that
was
nice
because
mean
old
work
said
joel
stretching
himself
picking
rocks
didn
t
our
backs
ache
dave
little
david
twisted
uneasily
in
his
chair
unwilling
to
say
how
very
unpleasant
he
had
found
the
task
of
picking
rocks
and
wishing
that
the
question
had
not
been
asked
well
said
polly
brightly
it
was
nice
when
the
boys
brought
home
the
fresh
vegetables
that
the
farmers
would
give
them
for
picking
those
rocks
you
ought
to
have
seen
mamsie
s
face
then
joel
straightened
up
at
that
and
forgot
all
about
his
aching
back
and
little
david
was
very
glad
he
hadn
t
been
obliged
to
say
anything
so
now
you
see
ran
on
polly
how
very
glad
deacon
brown
was
to
give
ben
the
big
stone
for
our
orchard
table
so
ben
tugged
and
tugged
and
and
we
helped
dave
and
i
did
shouted
joel
didn
t
we
ben
yes
indeed
said
ben
heartily
you
did
both
of
you
i
don
t
believe
i
could
ever
have
brought
the
great
thing
down
to
the
orchard
without
thereupon
joel
felt
very
big
and
tall
and
little
david
sat
up
as
high
in
his
chair
as
possible
oh
it
was
a
perfectly
splendid
table
exclaimed
polly
you
can
t
think
how
fine
it
was
when
it
was
all
set
up
under
our
it
was
most
flat
on
top
and
it
was
as
high
as
this
and
as
big
as
this
and
she
put
out
her
hands
and
began
to
measure
it
all
off
briskly
ho
that
isn
t
near
big
enough
cried
joel
springing
to
her
side
twas
as
big
as
this
and
he
executed
the
most
remarkable
series
of
curves
spreading
his
arms
to
the
infinite
discomfort
of
every
one
in
his
neighborhood
illustration
twas
as
big
as
this
see
here
called
ben
at
him
amidst
the
general
laugh
at
joel
s
table
if
you
go
on
knocking
off
all
our
heads
in
this
fashion
we
ll
put
you
out
this
second
yes
sir
the
idea
of
such
a
stone
as
that
why
it
would
have
taken
a
pair
of
horses
and
a
cart
to
bring
it
let
alone
our
digging
it
up
o
joe
i
don
t
care
said
joel
sturdily
it
was
as
big
as
that
anyway
bringing
his
arms
in
with
a
sudden
swoop
well
now
joe
said
jasper
if
you
don
t
keep
quiet
we
sha
n
t
get
any
further
in
this
story
than
that
table
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
joel
into
his
seat
as
quickly
as
he
had
jumped
off
and
polly
began
again
before
he
had
a
chance
to
speak
and
there
on
the
top
of
the
table
was
a
big
bunch
of
flowers
we
had
a
that
mamsie
had
given
us
because
it
was
cracked
and
the
handle
was
gone
and
ben
had
put
some
of
the
flowers
he
brought
from
the
woods
into
it
but
the
rest
he
made
up
into
little
bunches
and
laid
one
on
every
little
stone
seat
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
boys
had
brought
five
little
stones
one
for
each
of
us
so
we
could
always
have
our
chairs
ready
for
us
you
oh
dear
me
sighed
little
dick
quite
overcome
with
longing
how
i
do
wish
we
could
have
little
stone
seats
and
a
stone
table
added
van
enviously
and
a
whole
orchard
finished
percy
just
like
the
meantime
polly
was
hurrying
on
well
when
we
saw
all
those
lovely
things
that
ben
had
done
phronsie
spied
them
first
we
just
danced
around
him
and
we
held
our
hands
together
tight
so
he
couldn
t
get
out
of
the
ring
and
we
all
courtesied
and
bowed
and
thanked
him
as
much
as
we
i
should
think
you
did
said
ben
laughing
then
we
made
him
take
the
best
seat
in
honor
of
it
all
went
on
polly
and
polly
made
a
speech
of
thanks
said
joel
it
was
prime
and
ben
said
much
obliged
for
the
and
then
we
set
about
giving
our
play
said
polly
quickly
our
what
asked
the
whitneys
why
our
play
said
polly
didn
t
you
know
that
was
what
we
were
going
to
do
that
hot
afternoon
when
we
decided
to
go
out
in
the
orchard
well
i
must
tell
you
we
were
going
to
act
a
little
oh
oh
how
fine
exclaimed
percy
and
van
while
ben
cried
it
was
polly
s
play
she
thought
it
all
well
they
helped
to
act
it
said
polly
and
that
was
best
do
go
on
begged
the
whitney
boys
and
this
time
jasper
said
too
do
go
on
well
the
play
was
the
little
white
rabbit
and
mister
oh
oh
exclaimed
the
whitneys
while
jasper
smiled
approval
yes
phronsie
was
to
be
the
white
rabbit
you
see
we
d
got
an
old
white
bedspread
mamsie
let
us
take
for
our
plays
and
we
tied
up
two
ends
so
they
stuck
up
high
and
those
made
the
ears
and
when
she
was
in
it
and
the
paws
all
puckered
up
she
looked
very
nice
and
and
i
was
the
white
rabbit
jasper
said
phronsie
gravely
turning
to
him
i
know
pet
he
said
smiling
at
her
so
you
were
to
be
sure
as
polly
hurried
on
well
ben
was
mister
fox
and
he
did
look
so
funny
cried
polly
bursting
into
a
laugh
in
which
joel
and
david
joined
in
the
remembrance
you
see
he
had
a
big
piece
of
an
old
fur
rug
that
the
minister
s
wife
gave
him
one
day
to
carry
away
because
the
moths
had
got
into
it
and
she
didn
t
want
it
any
longer
and
it
made
just
a
splendid
bear
or
a
wolf
or
a
lion
only
this
time
it
was
a
fox
oh
that
old
fur
rug
was
fine
exploded
joel
with
sparkling
eyes
breaking
in
and
one
time
we
but
ben
pulling
him
down
polly
was
allowed
to
go
on
well
the
first
thing
in
the
play
said
polly
briskly
the
little
white
rabbit
is
fast
asleep
under
the
tree
and
old
mister
fox
comes
stealing
up
behind
her
and
says
very
softly
my
dear
miss
rabbit
and
she
opens
her
eyes
and
wakes
up
oh
she
says
is
that
you
mister
fox
and
he
says
yes
and
won
t
you
come
home
with
me
and
see
my
little
teenty
wee
foxes
oh
were
there
little
foxes

cried
the
whitney
boys
delightedly
yes
indeed
there
were
said
polly
quickly
there
were
two
little
foxes
in
a
hole
a
little
way
off
they
were
joel
and
david
you
know
they
were
spectators
with
me
while
little
white
rabbit
was
asleep
and
mister
fox
was
waking
her
up
then
when
he
invited
her
to
go
and
see
his
little
foxes
why
the
boys
scampered
off
and
got
into
their
where
was
the
hole
polly
asked
percy
oh
we
had
scooped
a
place
under
the
bank
where
the
grass
grew
high
said
polly
and
it
made
a
splendid
cave
whenever
we
wanted
wild
beasts
only
it
was
the
house
of
the
teenty
wee
little
foxes
well
so
then
little
white
rabbit
said
she
would
go
with
mister
fox
and
see
his
little
foxes
and
he
gave
her
his
hand
and
off
he
led
illustration
the
little
white
rabbit
and
mister
fox
o
polly
the
little
white
rabbit
didn
t
really
go
with
mister
fox

she
exclaimed
little
dick
in
horror
oh
yes
she
did
dicky
said
polly
then
seeing
his
face
she
made
haste
to
add
but
it
was
ben
you
know
so
she
wasn
t
oh
yes
it
was
ben
repeated
little
dick
hugging
himself
in
relief
well
and
so
off
they
went
to
the
hole
where
the
teenty
wee
little
foxes
were
said
polly
and
the
little
white
rabbit
put
her
paw
in
mister
fox
s
paw
and
when
they
got
there
mister
fox
says
now
just
step
down
into
my
hole
where
the
teenty
wee
little
foxes
are
because
you
can
see
them
so
very
much
and
did
she
polly

she
interrupted
little
dick
anxiously
yes
said
polly
but
the
teenty
little
wee
foxes
were
joel
and
david
you
know
so
they
couldn
t
hurt
the
little
white
oh
yes
they
were
joel
and
david
said
little
dick
drawing
a
relieved
sigh
well
when
phronsie
i
mean
the
little
white
rabbit
had
stepped
down
into
the
hole
up
jumps
the
two
teenty
little
foxes
and
they
ran
and
they
ran
past
her
and
past
mister
fox
as
quickly
as
they
could
so
as
to
be
audience
you
know
because
i
was
the
man
with
the
big
gun
to
go
out
and
shoot
mister
fox
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
do
it
so
joel
and
david
i
mean
the
two
teenty
little
wee
foxes
sat
down
on
their
stone
seats
and
the
man
with
the
big
gun
picked
it
up
and
he
ran
and
he
ran
to
the
hole
and
just
as
mister
fox
was
going
to
eat
up
the
little
white
rabbit
he
put
his
gun
up
to
his
shoulder
and
it
went
and
over
tumbled
mister
fox
and
little
white
rabbit
was
safe
it
was
impossible
to
describe
the
excitement
that
now
possessed
the
entire
group
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
anybody
could
be
heard
then
joel
cried
polly
tell
the
rest
tell
the
rest
oh
yes
cried
polly
with
shining
eyes
the
best
was
what
came
after
what
do
you
think
we
found
when
we
all
raced
back
you
know
i
had
hold
of
the
little
white
rabbit
s
paw
and
mister
fox
was
scampering
after
why
i
thought
you
said
when
the
man
s
big
gun
went
mister
fox
tumbled
over
dead
cried
percy
oh
yes
so
he
did
said
polly
coolly
but
he
had
to
jump
up
you
know
and
come
and
be
audience
because
then
the
little
foxes
were
going
to
try
to
get
the
little
white
rabbit
and
you
see
he
had
to
take
their
place
and
look
on
or
there
wouldn
t
be
any
oh
said
the
whitney
boys
yes
well
we
were
all
three
running
along
mister
fox
just
behind
when
joel
and
david
i
mean
the
little
teenty
wee
foxes
came
racing
over
the
grass
o
polly
pepper
they
screamed
come
come
and
then
they
turned
and
flew
back
i
can
tell
you
we
all
ran
then
what
was
it
oh
what
was
it
screamed
percy
and
van
and
little
dick
together
why
there
on
the
stone
lay
what
do
you
think
a
big
orange
and
a
bag
of
peanuts
oh
dear
me
cried
all
the
whitney
boys
tumbling
backward
in
dreadful
disappointment
is
that
all
gasped
percy
all
repeated
polly
why
you
can
t
think
how
perfectly
splendid
it
was
to
see
that
big
orange
as
yellow
as
gold
and
that
magnificent
bag
of
peanuts
standing
there
on
that
stone
table
why
it
seemed
as
if
they
must
have
dropped
right
down
from
the
little
puffy
white
clouds
sailing
above
our
heads
for
we
couldn
t
imagine
where
they
came
from
and
we
never
thought
of
finishing
up
our
play
but
the
little
white
rabbit
hopped
out
of
her
white
skin
and
mister
fox
tumbled
out
of
his
old
fur
rug
and
it
took
us
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
to
cut
and
divide
that
splendid
big
yellow
orange
and
to
count
out
those
magnificent
peanuts
and
to
give
them
all
around
except
the
time
it
took
to
eat
that
was
best
exclaimed
joel
smacking
his
lips
and
we
saved
some
for
mamsie

little
davie

t
we
