forth
some
gasping
truth
and
truth
looks
a
misshapen
and
untimely
growth
the
terror
of
the

its
shame
a
monster
coiling
in
its

lap
that
some
would
strangle

would
starve

still
it
breathes

passed

the
rough

of
its

changes
to
shining
locks
its
snaky
hair
and
moves
transfigured
into
angel
guise
welcomed
by
all
that
cursed
its
hour
of
birth

folded
in

slumbers

from
the
high

the
solemn
assurance
floated
forth
to
be
a
warning
or
a
promise
according
to
the
mental
state
of
those
whose
ears
it
filled
and
the
mind
familiar
with
the
phrase
continued
it
involuntarily
carrying
the
running
accompaniment
as
well
as
the
words
and
the
melody
on
to
the
end
after
the
last
reverberation
of
the
last
stroke
of
every
hour
had
died
away
and
just
when
expectation
had
been
succeeded
by
the
sense
of
silence
they
rang
it
out
by
day
and
night
the
bells
and
the
four
winds
of
heaven
by
day
and
night
spread
it
abroad
over
the
great
wicked
city
and
over
the
fair
flat
country
by
many
a
tiny
township
and
peaceful
farmstead
and
scattered
hamlet
on
on
it
was
said
to
the
sea
to
the
sea
which
was
twenty
miles
away
but
there
were
many
who
doubted
this
though
good
men
and
true
who
knew
the
music
well
declared
they
had
heard
it
every
note
distinct
on
summer
evenings
when
they
sat
alone
on
the
beach
and
the
waves
were
still
and
it
sounded
then
they
said
like
the
voice
of
a
tenor
who
sings
to
himself
softly
in
murmurous
monotones
and
some
thought
this
must
be
true
because
those
who
said
it
knew
the
music
well
but
others
maintained
that
it
could
not
be
true
just
for
that
very
reason
while
others
again
although
they
confessed
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
distance
sound
may
travel
under
special
circumstances
ventured
nevertheless
to
assert
that
the
chime
the
people
heard
on
those
occasions
was
ringing
in
their
own
hearts
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
strange
if
those
in
whose
mother
ears
it
had
rung
before
they
were
born
who
knew
it
for
one
of
their
first
sensations
and
felt
it
to
be
like
a
blood
relation
a
part
of
themselves
though
having
a
separate
existence
had
not
carried
the
memory
of
it
with
them
wherever
they
went
ready
to
respond
at
any
moment
like
sensitive
chords
vibrating
to
a
touch
but
everything
in
the
world
that
is
worth
a
thought
becomes
food
for
controversy
sooner
or
later
and
the
chime
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
differences
of
opinion
regarding
it
had
always
been
numerous
and
extreme
and
it
was
amusing
to
listen
to
the
wordy
warfare
which
was
continually
being
waged
upon
the
subject
there
were
people
living
immediately
beneath
it
who
wished
it
far
enough
they
said
but
they
used
to
boast
about
it
nevertheless
when
they
went
to
other
places
just
as
they
did
about
their
troublesome
children
whom
they
declared
in
like
manner
that
they
expected
to
be
the
death
of
them
when
they
and
their
worrying
ways
were
within
range
of
criticism
it
was
a
flagrant
instance
of
the
narrowness
of
small
humanity
which
judges
people
and
things
not
on
their
own
merits
but
with
regard
to
their
effect
upon
itself
a
circumstance
being
praised
because
importance
is
to
be
derived
from
importance
and
blamed
because
a
bilious
attack
makes
thought
on
any
subject
irritating
other
people
liked
the
idea
of
the
chime
but
were
not
content
with
its
arrangement
if
it
had
been
set
in
another
way
you
know
it
would
have
be
so
different
they
asserted
with
as
much
emphasis
as
if
there
were
wisdom
in
the
words
and
some
said
it
would
have
been
more
effective
if
it
had
not
rung
so
regularly
and
some
maintained
that
it
owed
its
power
to
that
same
regularity
which
suggested
something
permanent
in
this
weary
world
of
change
among
the
minor
details
of
the
discussion
there
was
one
point
in
particular
which
exercised
the
more
active
minds
but
did
not
seem
likely
ever
to
be
settled
it
was
as
to
whether
the
expression
given
to
the
announcement
by
the
bells
did
not
vary
at
different
hours
of
the
day
and
night
or
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
at
all
events
and
opinion
differed
as
widely
upon
this
point
as
we
are
told
they
did
on
one
occasion
in
some
other
place
with
regard
to
the
question
whether
a
fish
weighed
heavier
when
it
was
dead
than
when
it
was
alive
a
question
that
would
certainly
never
have
been
settled
either
had
it
not
happened
after
a
long
time
and
much
discussion
that
someone
accidentally
weighed
a
fish
when
it
was
found
there
was
no
difference
the
question
of
expression
however
could
not
be
decided
in
that
way
expression
being
imponderable
and
it
was
pretty
generally
acknowledged
that
the
truth
could
not
be
ascertained
and
must
therefore
remain
a
matter
of
opinion
but
that
did
not
stop
the
talk
once
indeed
someone
declared
positively
that
the
state
of
a
man
feelings
at
the
moment
would
influence
his
perceptions
and
make
the
chimes
sound
glad
when
he
was
glad
and
mournful
when
he
was
melancholy
but
nobody
liked
the
solution
let
them
wrangle
as
they
might
however
the
citizens
were
proud
of
their
chime
and
for
a
really
good
reason
it
meant
something
it
was
not
a
mere
jingle
of
bells
as
most
chimes
are
but
a
phrase
with
a
distinct
idea
in
it
which
they
understood
as
we
understand
a
foreign
language
when
we
can
read
it
without
translating
it
it
might
have
puzzled
them
to
put
the
phrase
into
other
words
but
they
had
it
off
pat
enough
as
it
stood
and
they
held
it
sacred
which
is
why
they
quarrelled
about
it
it
being
usual
for
men
to
quarrel
about
what
they
hold
sacred
as
if
the
thing
could
only
be
maintained
by
hot
insistence
the
things
they
hold
sacred
that
is
although
they
can
not
be
sure
of
them
like
the
forms
of
a
religion
which
admit
of
controversy
as
distinguished
from
the
god
they
desire
to
worship
about
whom
they
have
no
doubt
and
therefore
never
dispute
in
this
latter
respect
however
the
case
of
the
people
of
morningquest
was
just
the
reverse
of
that
which
obtains
in
most
other
places
for
in
consequence
of
the
hourly
insistence
of
the
chime
their
most
impressive
monitor
they
talked
much
more
of
him
whom
they
should
worship
than
of
various
ways
to
worship
him
and
the
most
persistent
of
all
the
questions
which
occupied
their
attention
arose
out
of
the
involuntary
but
continuous
effort
of
one
generation
after
another
to
define
with
scientific
accuracy
and
to
everybody
satisfaction
his
exact
nature
and
attributes
in
consequence
of
which
efforts
there
had
come
to
be
several
most
distinct
but
quite
contradictory
ideas
upon
the
subject
there
were
some
folk
to
whom
the
chime
typified
a
god
essentially
masculine
and
like
a
man
hugely
exaggerated
but
somewhat
amorphous
because
they
could
not
see
exactly
in
what
the
exaggeration
consisted
except
in
the
size
of
him
they
pictured
him
sitting
alone
on
a
throne
of
ivory
and
gold
inlaid
with
precious
stones
and
recited
the
catalogue
of
those
mentioned
in
the
book
of
the
revelation
by
preference
as
imparting
a
fine
scriptural
flavor
to
the
dea
and
he
sat
upon
the
throne
day
and
night
looking
down
upon
the
earth
and
never
did
anything
else
nor
felt
it
monotonous
buddha
himself
in
nirvana
could
not
have
attained
to
a
greater
perfection
of
contemplation
than
that
with
which
they
credited
this
curious
divinity
who
served
solely
for
a
finish
to
their
mental
range
as
the
sky
was
to
their
visual
a
useful
point
at
which
to
aim
their
rudimentary
faculty
of
reverence
but
others
again
of
a
different
order
of
intelligence
had
passed
beyond
this
stage
and
saw
in
him
more
of
a
creature
moving
about
in
worlds
not
realized
very
like
jove
but
unmarried
he
was
both
beneficent
and
jealous
and
had
to
be
propitiated
by
regular
attendance
at
church
but
further
than
that
he
was
not
exacting
and
therefore
they
ventured
to
take
his
name
in
vain
when
they
were
angry
and
also
to
call
upon
him
for
help
with
many
apologies
when
there
was
nobody
else
to
whom
they
could
apply
although
so
long
as
the
current
of
their
lives
ran
smoothly
on
they
seldom
troubled
their
heads
about
him
at
all
there
were
deeper
natures
than
those
however
who
were
not
content
with
this
small
advance
and
these
last
had
by
degrees
as
suited
their
convenience
but
without
perceiving
it
gradually
discovered
in
him
every
attribute
good
bad
or
indifferent
which
they
found
in
themselves
thus
ascribing
to
him
a
nature
of
a
highly
complex
and
most
extraordinarily
inconsistent
kind
less
that
of
a
god
than
of
a
demon
to
them
he
was
still
a
great
shape
like
a
man
but
a
shape
to
be
loved
as
well
as
feared
a
god
of
peace
who
patronized
war
a
gentle
lamb
who
looked
on
at
carnage
complacently
a
just
god
who
condemned
the
innocent
to
suffer
an
omnipotent
god
who
was
powerless
to
make
his
law
supreme
and
they
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
of
constantly
adding
to
or
slightly
altering
this
picture
but
having
completed
it
so
far
they
were
thoroughly
well
satisfied
with
it
and
incongruous
as
it
was
they
managed
to
make
it
the
most
popular
of
all
the
presentments
partly
because
being
so
flexible
it
could
be
adjusted
to
every
state
of
mind
but
also
because
there
was
money
in
it
numbers
of
people
lived
by
it
and
made
name
and
fame
besides
and
these
kept
it
going
by
damaging
anybody
who
ventured
to
question
its
beauty
for
there
is
no
faith
that
a
man
upholds
so
forcibly
as
the
one
by
which
he
earns
his
livelihood
whether
it
be
faith
in
the
fetish
he
has
helped
to
make
or
in
a
particular
kind
of
leather
that
sells
quickest
because
it
wears
out
so
fast
in
these
latter
days
however
it
began
to
appear
as
if
the
supremacy
of
the
great
masculine
idea
was
at
last
being
seriously
threatened
for
even
in
morningquest
a
new
voice
of
extraordinary
sweetness
had
already
been
heard
not
the
voice
of
man
but
the
collective
voice
of
humanity
which
declared
that
he
watching
was
the
good
the
great
moral
law
the
spirit
of
pure
love
elohim
mistranslated
in
the
book
of
genesis
as
he
only
but
signifying
the
union
to
which
all
nature
testifies
the
male
and
female
principles
which
together
created
the
universe
the
infinite
father
and
mother
without
whom
in
perfect
accord
and
exact
equality
the
best
government
of
nations
has
always
been
crippled
and
abortive
those
who
heard
this
final
voice
were
they
who
loved
the
chime
most
truly
and
reverenced
it
but
they
did
not
speak
about
it
much
only
when
the
message
sounded
they
listened
with
that
pleasure
which
is
the
best
praise
and
thanks
mendelssohn
must
have
felt
it
when
the
melody
first
occurred
to
him
and
the
words
had
wedded
themselves
to
the
music
in
his
soul
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
and
the
chime
certainly
had
power
to
move
the
hearts
of
many
but
it
would
be
hard
to
say
when
it
had
most
power
or
upon
whom
doubtless
the
majority
of
those
who
had
ears
to
hear
in
the
big
old
fashioned
city
heard
not
use
having
dulled
their
faculties
or
if
perchance
the
music
reached
them
it
conveyed
no
idea
to
their
minds
and
passed
unheeded
it
was
but
an
accustomed
measure
one
more
added
to
the
myriad
other
sounds
that
make
up
the
buzz
of
life
and
help
like
each
separate
note
of
a
chord
to
complete
the
varied
murmur
which
is
the
voice
of
a
whole
city
full
but
of
course
there
were
times
when
it
was
specially
apt
to
strike
home
in
the
early
morning
for
instance
when
the
mind
was
fresh
and
hope
was
strong
enough
to
interpret
the
assurance
into
a
promise
of
joy
and
again
at
noon
when
fatigue
was
growing
and
the
mind
perceived
a
sympathetic
melancholy
in
the
tones
which
was
altogether
restful
but
it
was
at
midnight
it
had
most
power
it
seemed
to
rise
then
to
the
last
pitch
of
enthusiasm
sounding
triumphant
like
the
special
effort
that
finishes
a
strain
as
if
to
speed
the
departing
interval
of
time
but
when
it
rang
again
after
the
first
hour
of
the
new
day
its
voice
had
dropped
as
it
were
to
that
tone
of
indifference
which
expresses
the
accustomed
doing
of
some
monotonous
duty
which
has
become
too
much
of
a
habit
to
excite
either
pleasure
or
pain
to
the
tired
watcher
then
for
whom
the
notes
were
mere
tones
conveying
no
idea
the
soft
melancholy
cadence
dulled
by
distance
was
like
the
echo
of
her
own
last
stifled
sigh
it
is
likely
however
that
the
chime
failed
less
of
its
effect
outside
the
city
than
it
did
within
but
there
again
it
depended
upon
the
hearer
when
the
mellow
tones
floated
above
the
heath
where
the
gipsies
camped
only
one
perchance
might
listen
lifting
her
bright
eyes
with
pleasure
and
longing
in
them
dumbly
as
a
child
might
yet
showing
for
a
moment
some
glimmering
promise
of
a
soul
but
to
many
in
the
village
close
at
hand
the
chime
brought
comfort
it
seemed
to
assure
the
sick
counting
the
slow
hours
that
they
were
not
forsaken
and
helped
them
to
bear
their
pain
with
patience
it
seemed
to
utter
to
the
wayworn
a
word
which
told
them
their
trouble
was
not
in
vain
it
seemed
to
invite
all
those
who
waited
and
were
anxious
to
trust
their
care
to
him
and
seek
repose
it
was
all
this
and
much
more
to
many
people
and
yet
when
it
spread
in
another
direction
over
the
fields
it
meant
nothing
to
the
yawning
ploughman
either
musical
or
poetical
had
no
significance
whatever
for
him
if
it
were
not
of
the
time
of
day
gathered
however
with
the
help
of
sundry
other
sensations
of
which
hunger
and
fatigue
were
chief
it
probably
conveyed
as
much
and
neither
more
nor
less
to
the
team
he
drove
but
perhaps
of
all
the
affairs
of
life
with
which
the
chime
had
mingled
the
most
remarkable
could
they
be
collected
and
recorded
would
be
the
occasions
on
which
the
hearing
of
the
message
had
marked
a
turning
point
in
the
career
of
some
one
person
as
happened
once
on
a
summer
afternoon
when
it
was
heard
by
a
lancashire
collier
a
young
lad
with
an
unkempt
mop
of
golden
hair
delicate
features
and
limbs
which
were
too
refined
for
his
calling
who
was
coming
up
the
river
morne
on
a
barge
the
river
winds
for
a
time
through
a
fertile
undulating
bit
of
country
and
nothing
of
the
city
can
be
seen
until
you
are
almost
in
it
except
the
castle
of
the
duke
of
morningquest
high
perched
on
a
hill
on
the
farther
side
and
the
spire
of
the
cathedral
which
might
not
attract
your
attention
however
if
it
were
not
pointed
out
to
you
above
the
trees
when
the
chime
floated
over
this
sparsely
peopled
tract
filling
the
air
with
music
but
coming
from
no
one
could
tell
whence
there
was
something
mysterious
in
the
sound
of
it
to
an
imaginative
listener
in
so
apparently
remote
a
place
and
once
twice
as
the
long
hours
passed
the
young
collier
heard
it
ring
and
wondered
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
listen
and
watch
the
man
on
the
bank
who
led
the
horse
that
was
towing
the
barge
or
address
a
rare
remark
to
his
solitary
companion
an
old
sailor
dressed
in
a
blue
jersey
and
the
invariable
drab
trowsers
and
long
boots
of
his
calling
who
steered
automatically
facing
the
meadows
in
beautiful
abstraction
he
would
have
faced
an
atlantic
gale
however
with
that
same
look
when
the
chime
rang
out
for
the
third
time
the
young
collier
spoke
it
the
varse
of
a
song
maybe
he
suggested
aye
lad
was
the
laconic
rejoinder
the
barge
moved
on
passed
a
little
farmhouse
close
to
the
water
edge
passed
some
lazy
cattle
standing
in
a
field
flicking
off
flies
with
their
tails
passed
a
patient
fisherman
who
had
not
caught
a
thing
that
day
and
scarcely
expected
to
but
still
fished
on
the
sun
sparkled
down
on
the
water
the
weary
man
and
horse
plodded
along
the
bank
far
away
a
sweet
bird
sang
and
the
collier
spoke
again
dost
tha
know
the
varse
he
said
the
old
man
had
been
brought
up
in
those
parts
he
knew
it
well
and
slowly
repeated
it
to
the
lad
who
listened
without
a
sign
sitting
with
his
dreamy
eyes
fixed
on
the
water
he
watching
over
israel
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
there
was
another
long
silence
and
then
the
lad
spoke
once
more
with
apathetic
gravity
asking
who
the
old
man
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
distant
reach
of
the
river
and
moved
no
muscle
of
his
face
i
guess
it
christ
he
said
at
last
ah
niver
tell
on
the
collier
answered
slowly
hast
tell
on
christ
the
old
man
asked
in
measured
tones
i
thowt
ivery
one
know
on
why
what
religion
are
you
well
me
feyther
a
liberal
leastways
as
brought
me
up
was
the
passionless
rejoinder
slowly
spoken
but
ah
doa
know
no
one
o
the
name
o
christ
an
what
more
ah
sure
doa
work
down
our
way
with
which
he
sauntered
forward
with
his
hands
in
his
trowser
pockets
and
sat
in
the
bow
and
the
old
man
steered
on
as
before
how
like
a
mind
is
to
a
river
both
may
be
pure
and
transparent
and
lovable
and
strong
to
support
and
admirable
each
may
mirror
the
beauties
of
earth
and
sky
and
still
have
a
wonderful
beauty
of
its
own
to
delight
us
both
are
always
moving
onward
bound
irresistibly
to
be
absorbed
in
a
great
ocean
mystery
to
be
swept
away
irreclaimably
without
hope
of
return
but
leaving
memories
of
themselves
in
good
or
evil
wrought
by
them
and
both
are
pure
at
the
outset
but
can
be
contaminated
when
they
in
turn
contaminate
and
being
perverted
in
their
use
become
accursed
and
curse
again
with
all
the
more
effect
because
the
province
of
each
was
to
bless
the
collier
lad
in
the
bow
of
the
barge
felt
something
of
the
fascination
of
the
river
that
day
he
saw
it
sparkle
in
the
sunshine
he
heard
it
ripple
along
its
banks
he
felt
the
slow
and
dreamy
motion
of
the
boat
it
bore
and
his
mind
was
filled
with
unaccustomed
thought
and
a
strange
yearning
which
he
did
not
understand
there
was
something
singularly
attractive
about
the
lad
although
his
clothes
were
tattered
his
golden
hair
and
delicate
skin
were
begrimed
his
great
bright
eyes
had
no
intelligent
expression
in
them
and
there
was
that
discontented
undisciplined
look
about
his
mouth
which
is
common
to
uneducated
men
he
had
no
human
knowledge
but
he
had
capacity
and
he
had
music
the
divine
gift
in
his
soul
and
the
voice
of
an
angel
to
utter
it
what
passed
through
his
dim
consciousness
in
the
interval
which
followed
his
last
remark
no
one
will
ever
know
but
the
chime
had
once
more
sounded
and
suddenly
as
he
sat
there
he
took
up
the
strain
and
sang
it
and
the
labourers
in
the
fields
and
the
loiterers
by
the
river
and
the
ladies
in
their
gardens
even
the
very
cattle
in
the
meadows
looked
up
and
listened
wondering
while
he
varied
the
simple
melody
as
singers
can
finding
new
meaning
in
the
message
and
filling
the
summer
silence
with
perfect
raptures
of
ecstatic
sound
it
was
a
voice
to
gladden
the
hearts
of
men
and
one
who
heard
it
knew
this
and
followed
the
barge
and
took
the
lad
and
had
him
taught
so
that
in
after
days
the
world
was
ready
to
fall
at
his
feet
and
worship
the
gift
and
so
time
passed
change
followed
change
but
the
chime
was
immutable
and
always
whatever
came
it
rang
out
calmly
over
the
beautiful
old
city
of
morningquest
and
entered
into
it
and
was
part
of
the
life
of
it
mixing
itself
impartially
with
the
good
and
evil
with
all
the
sin
and
suffering
the
pitiful
pettiness
the
indifference
the
cruelty
and
every
form
of
vice
as
much
as
with
the
purity
above
reproach
the
charity
the
the
unswerving
truth
the
patient
endurance
and
courage
not
to
be
daunted
which
are
in
every
city
mixing
itself
with
these
as
the
light
and
air
of
heaven
do
and
with
effects
doubtless
as
unexpected
and
as
fine
and
ready
also
to
be
a
help
to
the
helpless
a
guide
to
the
rash
and
straying
a
comfort
to
the
comfortless
a
reproach
to
the
reckless
and
a
warning
to
the
wicked
perhaps
an
ambitious
stranger
passing
through
the
city
would
hear
the
chime
and
pause
to
listen
and
in
the
pause
a
flash
of
recollection
would
show
him
the
weary
way
he
had
gone
the
disappointments
which
were
the
inevitable
accompaniments
of
even
his
most
brilliant
successes
in
the
years
of
toil
that
had
been
his
since
he
made
the
world
his
idol
and
swerved
from
the
higher
life
and
then
he
would
ask
himself
the
good
of
it
all
and
finding
that
there
was
no
good
he
would
go
his
way
cherishing
the
new
impression
and
asking
of
all
things
is
it
too
late
now
and
perhaps
at
the
same
moment
a
lady
rolling
past
in
her
carriage
would
say
how
sweet
or
the
beauty
of
the
bells
might
win
some
other
thoughtless
tribute
from
her
if
she
heard
the
chime
at
all
but
probably
she
never
heard
it
because
the
accustomed
tones
were
as
familiar
as
the
striking
of
the
hour
the
striking
of
an
hour
that
bore
no
special
significance
for
her
and
therefore
set
no
chord
vibrating
in
her
soul
the
thoughts
of
her
mind
deafened
her
heart
to
it
as
completely
as
the
thunder
of
a
waggon
had
at
the
same
time
deafened
the
waggoner
ears
while
the
bells
uttered
their
message
above
him
and
so
it
was
with
the
doctor
overworked
and
anxious
hurrying
on
his
rounds
the
grasping
lawyer
absorbed
in
calculation
and
all
the
other
the
indolent
woman
the
and
the
toiler
for
daily
bread
if
they
heard
they
heeded
not
because
their
hour
had
not
yet
come
at
least
this
is
what
some
thought
who
believed
that
for
every
one
a
special
hour
would
come
when
they
would
be
called
and
then
left
to
decide
as
it
were
between
life
and
if
they
accepted
life
the
next
message
would
be
fraught
with
strength
and
help
and
blessing
but
if
they
rejected
it
the
bells
would
utter
their
condemnation
and
leave
them
to
their
fate

chapter
i
at
nineteen
evadne
looked
out
of
narrow
eyes
at
an
untried
world
inquiringly
she
wanted
to
know
she
found
herself
forced
to
put
prejudice
aside
in
order
to
see
beneath
it
deep
down
into
the
sacred
heart
of
things
where
the
truth
is
and
the
bewildering
clash
of
human
precept
with
human
practice
ceases
to
vex
and
this
not
of
design
but
of
necessity
it
was
a
need
of
her
nature
to
know
when
she
came
across
something
she
did
not
understand
a
word
a
phrase
or
an
allusion
to
a
phase
of
life
the
thing
became
a
haunting
demon
only
to
be
exorcised
by
positive
knowledge
on
the
subject
ages
of
education
ages
of
hereditary
preparation
had
probably
gone
to
the
making
of
such
a
mind
and
rendered
its
action
inevitable
for
generations
knowledge
is
acquired
or
rather
instilled
by
force
in
families
but
once
in
a
way
there
comes
a
child
who
demands
instruction
as
a
right
and
in
her
own
family
evadne
appears
to
have
been
that
child
not
that
she
often
asked
for
information
her
faculty
was
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
acquire
it
without
troubling
herself
or
anybody
else
a
word
being
enough
on
some
subjects
to
make
whole
regions
of
thought
intelligible
to
her
it
was
as
if
she
only
required
to
be
reminded
of
things
she
had
learnt
before
her
mother
said
she
was
her
most
satisfactory
child
she
had
been
easy
of
education
in
the
schoolroom
she
had
listened
to
instruction
with
interest
and
intelligence
and
had
apparently
accepted
every
article
of
faith
in
god
and
man
which
had
been
offered
for
her
guidance
through
life
with
unquestioning
confidence
at
least
she
had
never
been
heard
to
object
to
any
axiom
and
she
did
in
fact
accept
them
all
but
only
provisionally
she
wanted
to
know
silent
sociable
sober
and
sincere
she
had
walked
over
the
course
of
her
early
education
and
gone
on
far
beyond
it
with
such
ease
that
those
in
authority
over
her
never
suspected
the
extent
to
which
she
had
outstripped
them
it
was
her
father
who
struck
the
keynote
to
which
the
tune
of
her
early
intellectual
life
was
set
she
was
about
twelve
years
old
at
the
time
and
they
were
sitting
out
on
the
lawn
at
fraylingay
one
day
after
dinner
as
was
their
wont
in
the
summer
he
on
this
occasion
under
the
influence
of
a
good
cigar
mellow
in
mind
and
moral
in
sentiment
but
inclining
to
be
didactic
for
the
moment
because
the
coffee
was
late
she
in
a
receptive
mood
ready
to
gather
silently
and
store
with
care
in
her
capacious
memory
any
precept
that
might
fall
from
his
lips
to
be
taken
out
and
tried
as
opportunity
offered
where
is
your
mother
he
asked
i
do
know
father
evadne
answered
i
think
she
is
in
the
drawing
room
never
say
you
my
dear
about
matters
of
fact
he
said
when
it
is
possible
to
it
is
your
business
to
find
out
and
if
you
can
not
find
out
you
must
say
you
do
know
it
is
moral
cowardice
injurious
to
yourself
not
to
own
your
ignorance
and
you
may
also
be
misleading
or
unintentionally
deceiving
someone
else
how
might
the
moral
cowardice
of
not
owning
my
ignorance
be
injurious
to
myself
father
she
asked
why
do
you
see
he
answered
you
would
suffer
in
two
ways
if
the
habit
of
inaccuracy
became
confirmed
your
own
character
would
deteriorate
and
by
leading
people
to
suppose
that
you
are
as
wise
as
themselves
you
lose
opportunities
of
obtaining
useful
information
they
wo
tell
you
things
they
think
you
know
already
evadne
bent
her
brows
upon
this
lesson
and
reflected
and
doubtless
it
was
the
origin
of
the
verbal
accuracy
for
which
she
afterward
became
notable
patient
investigation
had
always
been
a
pleasure
but
from
that
time
forward
it
became
a
principle
also
she
understood
from
what
her
father
had
said
that
to
know
the
facts
of
life
exactly
is
a
positive
duty
which
in
a
limited
sense
was
what
he
had
intended
to
teach
her
but
the
extent
to
which
she
carried
the
precept
would
have
surprised
him
her
mind
was
prone
to
experiment
with
every
item
of
information
it
gathered
in
order
to
test
its
practical
value
if
she
could
turn
it
to
account
she
treasured
it
if
not
she
rejected
it
from
whatever
source
it
came
but
she
was
not
herself
aware
of
any
reservation
in
her
manner
of
accepting
instruction
the
trick
was
innate
and
in
no
way
interfered
with
her
faith
in
her
friends
which
was
profound
she
might
have
justified
it
however
upon
her
father
authority
for
she
once
heard
him
say
to
one
of
her
brothers
find
out
for
yourself
and
form
your
own
opinions
a
lesson
which
she
had
laid
to
heart
also
not
that
her
father
would
have
approved
of
her
putting
it
into
practice
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
believe
emphatically
that
a
woman
should
hold
no
opinion
which
is
not
of
masculine
origin
and
the
maxims
he
had
for
his
boys
differed
materially
in
many
respects
from
those
which
he
gave
to
his
girls
but
these
precepts
of
his
were
after
all
only
matches
to
evadne
which
fired
whole
trains
of
reflection
and
lighted
her
to
conclusions
quite
other
than
those
at
which
he
had
arrived
himself
in
this
way
however
he
became
her
principal
instructor
she
had
attached
herself
to
him
from
the
time
that
she
could
toddle
and
had
acquired
from
his
conversation
a
proper
appreciation
of
masculine
precision
of
thought
if
his
own
statements
were
not
always
accurate
it
was
from
no
want
of
respect
for
the
value
of
facts
for
he
was
great
on
the
subject
and
often
insisted
that
a
lesson
or
principle
of
action
is
contained
in
the
commonest
fact
but
he
snubbed
evadne
promptly
all
the
same
on
one
occasion
when
she
mentioned
a
fact
of
life
and
drew
a
principle
of
action
therefrom
for
herself
only
confusion
comes
of
women
thinking
for
themselves
on
social
subjects
he
said
you
must
let
me
decide
all
such
matters
for
you
or
you
must
refer
them
to
your
husband
when
you
come
under
his
control
evadne
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
this
however
because
she
remembered
another
remark
of
his
with
which
she
could
not
make
it
agree
the
remark
was
that
women
never
had
thought
for
themselves
and
that
therefore
it
was
evident
that
they
could
not
think
and
that
they
should
not
try
now
as
it
is
obvious
that
confusion
can
not
come
of
a
thing
that
has
never
been
done
the
inaccuracy
in
one
or
other
of
these
statements
was
glaring
enough
to
put
both
out
of
the
argument
but
what
evadne
did
note
was
the
use
of
the
word
control
as
she
grew
up
she
became
her
father
constant
companion
in
his
walks
and
flattered
by
her
close
attention
he
fell
into
the
way
of
talking
a
good
deal
to
her
he
enjoyed
the
fine
flavour
of
his
own
and
so
did
she
but
in
such
a
silent
way
that
nothing
ever
led
him
to
suspect
it
was
having
any
but
the
most
desirable
effect
upon
her
mind
she
never
attempted
to
argue
and
only
spoke
in
order
to
ask
a
question
on
some
point
which
was
not
clear
to
her
or
to
make
some
small
comment
when
he
seemed
to
expect
her
to
do
so
he
often
contradicted
himself
and
the
fact
never
escaped
her
attention
but
she
loved
him
with
a
beautiful
confidence
and
her
respect
remained
unshaken
when
she
had
to
set
herself
right
between
his
discrepancies
she
did
not
dwell
on
the
latter
as
faults
in
him
but
only
thought
of
how
wise
he
was
when
he
warned
her
to
be
accurate
and
felt
grateful
and
in
this
way
she
formed
her
mind
upon
his
sayings
and
as
a
direct
result
of
the
long
informal
generally
peripatetic
lectures
to
which
she
listened
without
prejudice
and
upon
which
she
brought
unsuspected
powers
of
discrimination
to
bear
he
had
unconsciously
made
her
a
more
logical
reasoning
reasonable
being
than
he
believed
it
possible
for
a
woman
to
be
poor
papa
all
that
he
really
knew
of
his
most
interesting
daughter
was
that
she
was
growing
up
a
good
child
physically
strong
and
active
morally
well
educated
with
a
fortunately
equable
temper
and
that
she
owed
a
great
deal
to
him
what
precisely
was
never
defined
but
when
the
thought
of
his
kindness
recurred
to
him
it
always
suffused
him
with
happiness
he
was
a
portly
man
with
a
place
in
the
country
and
a
house
in
town
not
rich
for
his
position
but
well
off
a
magistrate
and
much
respected
well
educated
in
the
ideas
of
the
ancients
with
whom
his
own
ideas
on
many
subjects
stopped
short
and
hardly
to
be
called
intellectual
a
moderate
churchman
a
bigoted
conservative
narrow
and
strongly
prejudiced
rather
than
highly
principled
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
moral
progress
of
the
world
at
the
present
time
and
ready
to
resent
even
the
upward
tendency
of
evolution
when
it
presented
itself
to
him
in
the
form
of
any
change
including
of
course
changes
for
the
better
and
more
especially
so
if
such
change
threatened
to
bring
about
an
improvement
in
the
position
of
women
or
increase
the
weight
of
their
influence
for
good
in
the
world
the
mere
mention
of
the
subject
made
him
rabid
and
he
grew
apoplectic
whenever
he
reflected
upon
the
monstrous
pretensions
of
the
sex
at
the
present
time
but
the
thing
that
roused
his
scorn
and
indignation
most
was
when
a
woman
ventured
to
enter
any
protest
against
the
established
order
of
iniquity
he
allowed
that
a
certain
number
of
women
must
of
necessity
be
abandoned
and
raised
no
objection
to
that
but
what
he
did
consider
intolerable
was
that
any
one
woman
should
make
a
stand
against
the
degradation
of
her
own
sex
he
thought
that
immoral
he
was
well
enough
to
live
with
however
this
obstinate
english
country
gentleman
although
without
sympathetic
insight
and
liable
to
become
a
petty
domestic
tyrant
at
any
moment
sound
was
what
he
would
have
called
himself
and
he
was
a
man
to
be
envied
upon
the
whole
for
his
family
loved
him
and
his
friends
knew
no
ill
of
him
chapter
ii
evadne
like
the
vicar
of
wakefield
was
by
nature
a
lover
of
happy
human
faces
and
she
could
be
playful
herself
on
occasion
but
she
had
little
if
any
of
the
saving
sense
of
humor
her
habit
was
to
take
everything
grand
and
to
consider
it
when
other
people
were
laughing
she
would
be
gravely
observant
as
if
she
were
solving
a
problem
and
she
would
sooner
have
thought
of
trying
to
discover
what
combination
of
molecules
resulted
in
a
joke
with
a
view
to
benefiting
her
species
by
teaching
them
how
to
produce
jokes
at
will
than
of
trying
to
be
witty
herself
she
had
too
a
quite
irritating
trick
of
remaining
to
all
outward
seeming
stolidly
unmoved
by
events
which
were
causing
an
otherwise
general
commotion
but
in
cases
of
danger
or
emergency
she
was
essentially
swift
to
act
as
on
one
occasion
for
instance
when
the
hamilton
house
twins
were
at
fraylingay
the
twins
had
arrived
somewhat
late
in
the
married
lives
of
their
parents
and
had
been
welcomed
as
angel
visitants
under
which
fond
delusion
they
were
christened
respectively
angelica
and
theodore
before
they
were
well
out
of
their
nurse
arms
however
society
with
discernment
had
changed
theodore
name
to
diavolo
but
angelica
was
sanctioned
the
irony
being
obvious
the
twins
were
alike
in
appearance
but
not
nearly
so
much
so
as
twins
usually
are
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
to
distinguish
them
apart
even
if
one
had
not
been
dark
and
the
other
fair
and
for
this
mercy
everybody
connected
with
them
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
age
of
active
indiscretion
they
would
certainly
have
got
themselves
mixed
if
they
could
angelica
was
the
dark
one
and
she
was
also
the
elder
taller
stronger
and
wickeder
of
the
two
the
organizer
and
commander
of
every
expedition
before
they
were
five
years
old
everybody
about
the
place
was
upon
the
alert
both
in
and
also
to
see
that
the
twins
did
not
kill
themselves
bars
of
iron
had
to
be
put
on
the
upstairs
windows
to
prevent
them
making
ladders
of
the
traveller
joy
and
wisteria
modes
of
egress
which
they
very
much
preferred
to
commonplace
doors
and
had
been
reluctantly
obliged
to
have
the
moat
which
was
deep
and
full
of
fish
and
had
been
the
glory
of
hamilton
house
for
generations
drained
for
fear
of
accidents
argument
was
unavailing
with
the
twins
as
a
means
of
repression
but
they
were
always
prepared
to
argue
out
any
question
of
privilege
with
their
father
and
mother
cheerfully
punishment
too
had
an
effect
quite
other
than
that
intended
they
were
interested
at
the
moment
but
they
would
slap
each
other
hands
and
put
each
other
in
the
corner
for
fun
five
minutes
after
they
had
received
similar
chastisement
in
solemn
earnest
they
would
have
lived
out
of
doors
altogether
by
choice
and
they
managed
to
make
their
escape
in
all
weathers
if
the
vigilant
watch
that
was
kept
upon
them
were
relaxed
for
a
moment
they
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
and
would
probably
only
be
recovered
at
the
farthest
limit
of
their
property
or
in
the
kitchen
of
some
neighbouring
country
gentleman
where
they
were
sure
to
be
popular
they
were
always
busy
about
something
and
when
every
usual
occupation
failed
they
fought
each
other
after
a
battle
they
counted
scars
and
scratches
for
the
honour
of
having
most
and
if
there
were
not
bruises
enough
to
satisfy
one
of
them
the
other
was
always
obligingly
ready
to
fight
again
until
there
were
had
great
faith
in
the
discipline
of
the
church
service
for
them
and
was
anxious
that
they
should
be
early
accustomed
to
go
there
they
behaved
pretty
well
while
the
solemnity
was
strange
enough
to
awe
them
and
one
sunday
when
lady
adeline
their
mother
could
not
accompany
him
ventured
to
go
alone
with
them
he
took
the
precaution
to
place
them
on
either
side
of
him
so
as
to
separate
them
and
interpose
a
solid
body
between
them
and
any
signals
they
might
make
to
each
other
but
in
the
quietest
part
of
the
service
when
everybody
was
kneeling
some
movement
of
diavolo
attracted
his
attention
for
a
moment
from
angelica
and
when
he
looked
again
the
latter
had
disappeared
she
had
discovered
that
it
was
possible
to
creep
from
pew
to
pew
beneath
the
seats
and
had
started
to
explore
the
church
on
her
way
however
she
observed
a
pair
of
stout
legs
belonging
to
a
respectable
elderly
woman
who
was
too
deep
in
her
devotion
to
be
aware
of
the
intruder
and
being
somewhat
astonished
by
their
size
she
proceeded
to
test
their
quality
with
a
pin
the
consequence
being
an
appalling
shriek
from
the
woman
which
started
a
shrill
treble
cry
from
herself
the
service
was
suspended
and
the
most
precise
of
men
hastened
down
the
aisle
and
fished
his
daughter
out
an
awful
spectacle
of
dust
from
under
the
seat
incontinently
when
and
lady
adeline
went
from
home
for
any
length
of
time
they
were
obliged
to
take
their
children
with
them
as
servants
who
knew
the
latter
would
rather
leave
than
be
left
in
charge
of
them
and
this
was
how
it
happened
that
evadne
made
their
acquaintance
at
an
early
age
it
was
during
their
first
visit
to
fraylingay
while
they
were
still
quite
tiny
and
she
was
hardly
in
her
teens
that
the
event
referred
to
in
illustration
of
one
of
evadne
characteristics
occurred
the
twins
had
arrived
late
in
the
afternoon
and
were
taken
into
the
dining
room
where
the
table
was
already
decorated
for
dinner
it
evidently
attracted
a
good
deal
of
their
attention
but
they
said
nothing
at
dessert
however
to
which
evadne
had
come
down
with
the
elder
children
the
dining
room
door
was
seen
to
open
with
portentous
slowness
and
there
appeared
in
the
aperture
two
little
figures
in
long
nightgowns
their
forefingers
in
their
mouths
their
inquisitive
noses
tilted
in
the
air
and
their
bright
eyes
round
with
astonishment
it
was
like
the
middle
of
the
night
to
them
and
they
had
expected
to
find
the
room
empty
oh
you
naughty
children
lady
adeline
exclaimed
the
cried
frayling
evadne
mother
let
them
come
in
and
she
picked
up
angelica
and
held
her
on
her
knee
one
of
the
other
ladies
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
long
table
taking
diavolo
up
at
the
same
time
but
the
moment
the
children
found
themselves
on
a
level
with
the
table
they
made
a
dart
for
the
centre
piece
simultaneously
on
their
hands
and
knees
regardless
of
the
smash
of
dessert
plates
decanters
wineglasses
and
fruit
dishes
which
they
upset
by
the
way
it
shrieked
angelica
thumping
the
flat
mirror
which
was
part
of
the
table
decorations
triumphantly
it
is
cried
lady
adeline
endeavoring
to
reach
the
child
it
mamma
diavolo
said
it
was
water
there
was
much
amusement
at
the
words
and
at
the
quaint
spectacle
of
the
two
little
creatures
sitting
amid
the
wreckage
in
the
middle
of
the
table
not
a
bit
abashed
by
the
novelty
of
their
conspicuous
position
only
evadne
who
was
standing
behind
her
mother
chair
remained
grave
she
seemed
to
be
considering
the
situation
severely
and
acting
on
her
own
responsibility
she
picked
diavolo
up
in
the
midst
of
the
general
hilarity
and
carried
him
out
of
the
room
with
her
hand
pressed
tight
on
his
thigh
the
child
had
come
down
armed
with
an
open
penknife
with
which
to
defend
angelica
should
they
encounter
any
ogres
or
giants
on
the
stairs
and
in
scrambling
up
the
table
he
had
managed
to
strike
himself
in
the
thigh
with
it
and
had
severed
the
femoral
artery
but
with
the
curious
shame
which
makes
some
children
dislike
to
own
that
they
are
hurt
he
had
contrived
to
conceal
the
accident
for
a
moment
with
his
nightgown
under
cover
of
the
flowers
and
it
was
only
evadne
observant
eye
and
presence
of
mind
that
had
saved
his
life
no
one
in
the
house
could
make
a
tourniquet
and
she
sat
with
the
child
on
her
knee
while
a
doctor
was
being
fetched
keeping
him
quiet
as
by
a
miracle
and
stopping
the
hemorrhage
with
the
pressure
of
her
thumb
not
even
his
parents
daring
to
relieve
her
since
diavolo
had
never
been
known
to
be
still
so
long
in
his
life
with
anybody
else
she
held
him
till
the
operation
of
tying
the
artery
was
safely
accomplished
by
which
time
diavolo
was
sufficiently
exhausted
to
be
good
and
go
to
sleep
and
then
she
quietly
fainted
but
she
was
about
again
in
time
to
catch
him
when
he
woke
and
keep
him
quiet
and
so
by
unwearied
watching
she
prevented
accidents
until
all
danger
was
over
diavolo
afterward
heard
his
parents
praise
her
in
unmeasured
terms
to
parents
one
day
in
her
absence
she
happened
to
return
while
they
were
still
in
the
room
and
being
doubtless
wide
awake
to
the
advantages
of
such
a
connection
he
took
the
opportunity
of
promising
solemnly
in
the
presence
of
such
respectable
witnesses
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
he
was
able
she
had
added
the
word
tourniquet
to
her
vocabulary
during
this
time
and
having
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
she
requested
the
doctor
to
be
so
good
as
to
teach
her
to
make
one
while
doing
so
the
doctor
became
interested
in
his
silent
intelligent
pupil
and
it
ended
in
his
teaching
her
all
that
a
young
lady
could
learn
of
bandaging
of
antidotes
to
poisons
of
what
to
do
in
case
of
many
possible
accidents
and
also
of
nursing
theoretically
but
this
was
not
a
solitary
instance
of
the
quiet
power
of
the
girl
which
already
compelled
even
elderly
gentlemen
much
overworked
and
to
sacrifice
themselves
in
her
service
chapter
iii
it
is
a
notable
thing
that
in
almost
every
instance
it
was
her
influence
which
forced
evadne
to
draw
conclusions
in
regard
to
life
quite
unlike
any
of
his
own
and
very
distasteful
to
him
he
was
the
most
conservative
of
men
and
yet
he
was
continually
setting
her
mind
off
at
a
tangent
in
search
of
premises
upon
which
to
found
conclusions
his
primitive
theories
about
women
and
all
that
they
are
good
for
for
one
thing
which
differed
so
materially
from
the
facts
as
she
observed
them
every
day
formed
a
constant
mental
stimulus
to
which
her
busy
brain
was
greatly
indebted
women
should
confine
their
attention
to
housekeeping
he
remarked
once
when
the
talk
about
the
higher
education
of
women
first
began
to
irritate
elderly
gentlemen
it
is
all
they
are
fit
for
is
it
said
evadne
yes
and
they
do
know
arithmetic
enough
to
do
that
properly
do
they
why
she
asked
because
they
have
no
brains
he
answered
but
some
women
have
been
clever
she
ventured
seriously
yes
of
course
exceptional
women
but
you
ca
argue
from
exceptional
women
then
ordinary
women
have
no
brains
and
can
not
learn
arithmetic
she
concluded
precisely
he
answered
irritably
such
signs
of
intelligence
always
did
irritate
him
somehow
evadne
found
food
for
reflection
in
these
remarks
she
had
done
a
certain
amount
of
arithmetic
herself
in
the
schoolroom
and
had
never
found
it
difficult
but
then
she
had
not
gone
far
enough
perhaps
and
she
went
at
once
to
get
a
colenso
or
a
barnard
smith
to
see
she
found
them
more
fascinating
when
she
attacked
them
of
her
own
free
will
and
with
all
her
intelligence
than
she
had
done
when
necessity
in
the
shape
of
her
governess
forced
her
to
pay
them
some
attention
and
she
went
through
them
both
in
a
few
weeks
at
odd
times
and
then
asked
her
father
advice
about
a
book
on
advanced
mathematics
advanced
mathematics
he
exclaimed
can
you
keep
accounts
i
do
know
she
answered
doubtfully
then
what
is
this
nonsense
about
advanced
mathematics
oh
i
have
finished
barnard
smith
and
i
thought
i
should
like
to
go
on
she
explained
now
is
that
like
your
sex
he
observed
smiling
at
his
own
superiority
you
pick
things
up
with
a
sharpness
but
intelligence
enough
to
make
any
practical
application
of
them
a
woman
closely
resembles
a
parrot
in
her
mental
processes
and
in
the
use
she
makes
of
fine
phrases
which
she
does
not
understand
to
produce
an
effect
of
cleverness
such
as
mathematics
evadne
bent
her
brow
and
let
him
ruminate
a
little
in
infinite
then
asked
abruptly
can
men
keep
accounts
who
have
never
seen
accounts
kept
no
of
course
not
he
answered
seeing
in
this
a
new
instance
of
feminine
imbecility
and
laughing
ah
she
observed
then
added
thoughtfully
as
she
moved
away
i
should
like
to
see
how
accounts
are
kept
she
never
had
any
more
conversation
with
her
father
upon
this
subject
but
from
that
time
forward
mathematics
which
had
before
been
only
an
incident
in
the
way
of
lessons
became
an
interest
in
life
and
a
solid
part
of
her
education
but
although
she
found
she
could
do
arithmetic
without
any
great
difficulty
it
never
occurred
to
her
either
that
her
father
could
be
wrong
or
that
there
might
be
in
herself
the
making
of
an
exceptional
woman
the
habit
of
love
and
respect
kept
her
attention
from
any
point
which
would
have
led
to
a
judgment
upon
her
father
and
she
was
too
unconscious
of
herself
as
a
separate
unit
to
make
personal
application
of
anything
as
yet
her
mind
at
this
time
like
the
hold
of
a
ship
with
a
general
cargo
was
merely
being
stored
with
the
raw
materials
which
were
to
be
distributed
over
her
whole
life
and
turned
by
degrees
to
many
purposes
useful
beautiful
not
impossibly
detestable
but
that
remark
of
her
father
about
all
that
women
are
fit
for
which
he
kept
well
watered
from
time
to
time
with
other
conventional
expressions
of
a
contemptuous
kind
was
undoubtedly
the
seed
of
much
more
than
a
knowledge
of
the
higher
mathematics
it
was
that
which
set
her
mind
off
on
a
long
and
patient
inquiry
into
the
condition
and
capacity
of
women
and
made
her
in
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
essentially
herself
but
she
did
not
begin
her
inquiry
of
set
purpose
she
was
not
even
conscious
of
the
particular
attention
she
paid
to
the
subject
she
had
no
foregone
conclusion
to
arrive
at
no
wish
to
find
evidence
in
favour
of
the
woman
which
would
prove
the
man
wrong
only
coming
across
so
many
sneers
at
the
incapacity
of
women
she
fell
insensibly
into
the
habit
of
asking
why
the
question
to
begin
with
was
always
why
are
women
such
inferior
beings
but
by
degrees
as
her
reading
extended
it
changed
its
form
and
then
she
asked
herself
doubtfully
are
women
such
inferior
beings
a
position
which
carried
her
in
front
of
her
father
at
once
by
a
hundred
years
and
led
her
rapidly
on
to
the
final
conclusion
that
women
had
originally
no
congenital
defect
of
inferiority
and
that
although
they
have
still
much
way
to
make
up
it
now
rests
with
themselves
to
be
inferior
or
not
as
they
choose
she
had
an
industrious
habit
of
writing
what
she
thought
about
the
works
she
studied
and
there
is
an
interesting
record
still
in
existence
of
her
course
of
reading
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
nineteen
it
consists
of
one
thick
volume
on
the
title
page
of
which
she
had
written
roundly
but
without
a
flourish
commonplace
book
and
the
date
the
first
entries
are
made
in
a
careful
unformed
childish
hand
and
with
diffidence
evidently
but
they
became
rapidly
decided
both
in
caligraphy
and
tone
as
she
advanced
the
handwriting
is
small
and
cramped
but
the
latter
probably
with
a
view
to
economy
of
space
and
it
is
always
clear
and
neat
there
are
few
erasures
or
mistakes
of
grammar
or
spelling
even
from
the
first
and
little
tautology
but
she
makes
no
attempt
at
literary
style
or
elegance
of
expression
still
all
that
she
says
is
impressive
and
probably
on
that
account
she
chooses
the
words
best
calculated
to
express
her
meaning
clearly
and
concisely
and
undoubtedly
her
meaning
is
always
either
a
settled
conviction
or
an
honest
endeavour
to
arrive
at
one
it
is
the
honesty
in
fact
that
is
so
impressive
she
never
thinks
of
trying
to
shine
in
the
composition
of
words
there
was
no
idea
of
budding
authorship
in
her
mind
she
had
no
more
consciousness
of
purpose
in
her
writing
than
she
had
in
her
pinging
when
she
sang
about
the
place
the
one
was
as
involuntary
as
the
other
and
the
outcome
of
similar
sensations
it
pleased
her
to
write
and
it
pleased
her
to
sing
and
she
did
both
when
the
impulse
came
upon
her
she
must
however
have
had
considerable
natural
facility
of
expression
writing
seems
always
to
have
been
her
best
mode
of
communication
she
was
shy
from
the
first
in
conversation
but
bold
to
a
fault
with
her
pen
some
of
the
criticisms
she
wrote
in
her
commonplace
book
are
quite
exhaustive
most
of
them
are
temperate
although
she
does
give
way
occasionally
to
bursts
of
fiery
indignation
at
things
which
outrage
her
sense
of
justice
but
the
general
characteristic
is
a
marked
originality
not
only
in
her
point
of
view
but
also
in
the
use
she
makes
of
quite
unpromising
materials
in
fact
the
most
notable
part
of
the
record
is
the
proof
it
contains
that
all
the
arguments
upon
which
she
formed
her
opinions
were
found
in
the
enemy
works
alone
she
had
drawn
her
own
conclusions
but
after
having
done
so
as
it
happened
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
confirmation
strong
in
john
stuart
mill
on
the
subjection
of
women
which
she
came
across
by
accident
an
accident
by
the
way
for
which
lady
adeline
was
responsible
she
brought
the
book
to
fraylingay
and
forgot
it
when
she
went
home
and
evadne
happening
to
find
it
throwing
about
took
charge
of
it
read
it
with
avidity
and
found
for
herself
a
world
of
thought
in
which
she
could
breathe
freely
the
vicar
of
wakefield
was
one
of
her
early
favourites
she
read
it
several
times
and
makes
mention
of
it
twice
in
her
commonplace
book
her
first
notice
of
it
is
a
childish
little
synopsis
very
quaint
in
its
unconscious
irony
but
interesting
principally
from
the
fact
that
she
was
struck
even
then
by
the
point
upon
which
she
afterward
became
so
strong
the
vicar
she
says
was
a
good
man
and
very
fond
of
his
wife
and
family
and
they
were
very
fond
of
him
but
his
wife
was
queer
and
could
only
read
a
little
he
never
taught
her
to
improve
herself
he
had
books
and
was
learned
footnote
this
is
the
point
alluded
to
he
had
two
daughters
who
were
spiteful
and
did
not
like
other
girls
to
be
pretty
they
had
bad
taste
too
and
wanted
to
go
to
church
overdressed
and
thought
it
finer
to
ride
a
than
walk
it
does
not
say
that
they
ever
read
anything
either
if
they
had
they
would
have
known
better
there
is
a
very
nasty
man
in
the
book
called
squire
thornhill
and
a
nice
one
called
sir
william
thornhill
who
was
his
uncle
sir
william
marries
sophia
and
squire
thornhill
marries
olivia
although
he
does
not
intend
to
olivia
was
a
horrid
deceitful
girl
and
it
served
her
right
to
get
such
a
husband
they
have
a
brother
called
moses
who
used
to
talk
philosophy
with
his
father
at
dinner
and
once
sold
a
cow
for
a
gross
of
green
spectacles
a
gross
is
twelve
dozen
of
course
they
were
all
annoyed
but
the
vicar
himself
was
cheated
by
the
same
man
when
he
went
to
sell
the
horse
he
seemed
to
think
a
great
deal
of
knowing
latin
and
greek
but
it
was
not
much
use
to
him
then
it
was
funny
that
he
should
be
conceited
about
what
he
knew
himself
and
not
want
his
wife
to
know
anything
he
said
to
her
once
never
dispute
your
abilities
to
make
a
goose
pie
and
i
beg
you
leave
argument
to
me
which
she
might
have
thought
rude
but
perhaps
she
was
not
a
lady
as
ladies
do
not
make
goose
pies
i
forgot
though
they
had
lost
all
their
money
they
had
great
troubles
and
the
vicar
was
put
in
prison
he
was
very
ill
but
preached
to
the
prisoners
and
everybody
loved
him
i
like
vicar
of
wakefield
very
much
and
if
i
can
not
find
another
book
as
nice
i
shall
read
it
again
gentle
hermit
is
silly
i
suppose
took
edwin
and
angelina
out
of
it
to
laugh
at
them
quite
three
years
must
have
elapsed
before
she
again
mentions
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
in
the
meantime
she
had
been
reading
a
fair
variety
of
books
but
for
the
most
part
under
schoolroom
supervision
carefully
selected
for
her
some
however
she
had
chosen
for
herself
during
the
holidays
when
discipline
was
relaxed
but
it
was
a
fault
which
she
had
to
confess
and
she
does
so
always
honestly
lewes
life
of
goethe
was
one
of
these
she
wrote
a
glowing
description
of
it
at
the
end
of
which
she
says
i
found
the
book
on
a
sofa
in
the
drawing
room
and
began
it
without
thinking
and
read
and
read
until
i
had
nearly
finished
it
quite
forgetting
to
ask
leave
but
of
course
i
went
at
once
to
tell
father
as
soon
as
i
thought
of
it
mother
was
there
too
and
inclined
to
scold
but
father
frowned
and
said
her
alone
it
will
do
her
no
harm
she
wo
understand
it
i
asked
if
i
might
finish
it
and
he
said
yes
impatiently
i
think
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
and
i
am
sorry
i
interrupted
him
at
an
inconvenient
time
mother
often
does
not
agree
with
father
but
she
always
gives
in
very
often
she
is
right
however
and
he
is
wrong
last
week
she
did
not
want
us
to
go
out
one
day
because
she
was
sure
it
would
rain
but
he
did
not
think
so
and
said
we
had
better
go
it
did
rain
poured
and
we
got
wet
through
and
have
had
colds
ever
since
but
when
we
came
in
mother
scolded
me
for
saying
see
you
were
right
she
said
i
should
be
saying
told
yon
so
next
in
a
nasty
jeering
way
as
the
boys
do
which
really
means
rejoicing
because
somebody
else
is
wrong
and
is
not
generous
i
hope
i
shall
never
come
to
that
but
i
know
if
i
am
ever
sure
of
a
thing
being
right
which
somebody
else
thinks
is
wrong
it
wo
matter
what
it
is
or
who
it
is
i
shall
not
give
in
i
do
see
how
i
could
her
pen
seldom
ran
away
with
her
into
personal
matters
like
these
in
the
early
part
of
the
book
but
from
the
first
she
was
apt
to
be
beguiled
occasionally
by
the
pleasure
of
perceiving
a
powerful
stimulant
under
the
influence
of
which
everything
is
lost
sight
of
but
the
point
perceived
she
had
never
to
fight
a
daily
and
exhausting
battle
for
her
private
opinions
as
talkative
people
have
simply
because
she
rarely
if
ever
expressed
an
opinion
but
her
father
stood
ready
always
a
post
of
resistance
to
innovation
upon
which
she
could
sharpen
the
claws
of
her
conclusion
silently
whenever
they
required
it
when
next
she
mentions
the
vicar
of
wakefield
she
says
expressly
i
do
not
remember
what
i
wrote
about
it
the
first
time
i
read
it
and
i
will
not
look
to
see
until
i
have
written
what
i
think
now
because
i
should
like
to
know
if
i
still
agree
with
myself
as
i
was
then
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
very
much
she
does
agree
with
herself
as
she
was
then
the
feeling
in
fact
is
the
same
but
it
has
passed
from
her
heart
to
her
head
and
been
resolved
by
the
process
into
positive
opinion
held
with
conscious
knowledge
and
delivered
with
greatly
improved
power
of
expression
vicar
of
wakefield
makes
me
think
a
good
deal
she
continues
but
there
is
no
order
in
my
thoughts
there
is
however
one
thing
in
the
book
that
strikes
me
first
and
foremost
and
above
all
others
which
is
that
the
men
were
educated
and
the
women
were
ignorant
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
women
preferred
to
be
ignorant
and
therefore
i
presume
they
were
not
allowed
the
educational
advantages
upon
which
the
men
prided
themselves
the
men
must
accordingly
have
withheld
these
advantages
by
main
force
yet
they
do
not
scorn
to
sneer
at
the
consequences
of
their
injustice
there
is
a
sneer
implied
in
the
vicar
remark
about
his
own
wife
could
read
any
english
book
without
much
spelling
that
her
ignorance
was
not
the
consequence
of
incapacity
is
proved
by
the
evidence
which
follows
of
her
intelligence
in
other
matters
had
primrose
been
educated
she
might
have
continued
less
lovable
than
the
vicar
but
she
would
probably
have
been
wiser
the
vicar
must
always
have
been
conscious
of
her
defects
but
had
never
apparently
thought
of
a
remedy
nor
does
he
dream
of
preventing
a
repetition
of
the
same
defects
in
his
daughters
by
providing
them
with
a
better
education
he
takes
their
unteachableness
for
granted
remarking
complacently
that
an
hour
of
recreation
taken
up
in
innocent
mirth
between
my
wife
and
daughters
and
in
philosophical
arguments
between
my
son
and
me
as
if
mirth
were
as
much
as
he
could
reasonably
expect
from
such
inferior
beings
as
a
wife
and
daughters
must
necessarily
be
the
average
school
girl
of
is
a
child
of
light
on
the
subject
of
her
own
sex
compared
with
the
gentle
vicar
and
incapable
even
before
her
education
is
half
over
of
the
envy
and
meanness
which
the
latter
thinks
it
kindest
to
take
a
humourous
view
of
and
of
the
disingenuousness
at
which
he
also
smiles
as
the
inevitable
outcome
of
feminine
inferiority
at
least
never
met
a
girl
in
my
position
who
would
not
have
admired
miss
wilmot
beauty
nor
do
i
know
one
who
would
not
answer
her
father
frankly
however
embarrassing
the
question
might
be
if
he
asked
her
opinion
of
a
possible
lover
the
next
entry
in
the
book
is
on
the
subject
of
caudle
curtain
lectures
and
like
most
of
the
others
it
merits
attention
from
the
unexpected
view
she
takes
of
the
position
it
does
not
strike
her
as
being
humourous
but
pathetic
she
feels
the
misery
of
it
and
she
had
already
begun
to
hold
that
human
misery
is
either
a
thing
to
be
remedied
or
a
sacred
subject
to
be
dwelt
on
in
silence
and
she
considers
caudle
entirely
with
a
view
to
finding
a
cure
for
her
case
the
caudles
were
petty
tradespeople
she
says
respectable
in
their
own
position
but
hardly
lovable
according
to
our
ideas
caudle
with
meek
persistency
goes
out
to
amuse
himself
alone
when
his
day
work
is
done
caudle
day
work
never
is
done
she
has
the
wearing
charge
of
a
large
family
and
the
anxiety
of
making
both
ends
meet
on
a
paltry
income
which
entails
much
self
denial
and
sordid
parsimony
but
is
conscientiously
done
if
not
cheerfully
nevertheless
it
is
caudle
however
who
grumbles
making
no
allowance
for
extra
pressure
of
work
on
washing
days
when
she
is
too
busy
to
hash
the
cold
mutton
the
rule
of
her
life
is
weariness
and
worry
from
morning
till
night
and
for
relaxation
in
the
evening
she
must
sit
down
and
mend
the
clothes
and
even
when
that
is
done
she
goes
to
bed
with
the
certainty
of
being
roused
from
her
rest
by
a
husband
who
brings
a
sickening
odour
of
bad
tobacco
and
spirits
home
with
him
and
naturally
her
temper
suffers
she
knows
nothing
of
love
and
sympathy
she
has
no
pleasurable
interest
in
life
fatigue
and
worry
are
succeeded
by
profound
disheartenment
one
can
imagine
that
while
she
was
young
the
worn
garments
she
was
wont
to
mend
during
those
long
lonely
evenings
were
often
wet
with
tears
the
dulness
must
have
been
deadly
and
dulness
added
to
fatigue
time
after
time
ended
at
last
not
in
tears
but
in
peevish
irritation
ebullitions
of
spleen
and
ineffectual
resistance
the
woman
was
thoroughly
embittered
and
the
man
had
to
pay
the
penalty
whatever
pleasure
there
might
have
been
in
their
joint
lives
he
had
secured
for
himself
leaving
her
to
stagnate
for
want
of
a
little
variety
to
keep
her
feelings
flowing
wholesomely
and
she
did
stagnate
dutifully
but
she
was
to
blame
for
it
had
she
gone
out
and
amused
herself
with
other
wives
similarly
situated
and
had
tobacco
and
beer
if
she
liked
them
every
evening
it
would
have
been
better
for
herself
and
her
husband
there
must
have
been
some
system
in
evadne
reading
for
the
naggletons
came
immediately
after
caudle
and
are
dismissed
curtly
enough
vulgar
lower
class
people
she
calls
them
objectionable
to
contemplate
from
every
point
of
view
but
a
book
which
should
enlighten
the
class
whom
it
describes
on
the
subject
of
their
own
bad
manners
do
nag
she
owed
her
acquaintance
with
the
next
two
books
she
mentions
to
the
indirect
instigation
of
her
father
and
she
must
have
read
them
when
she
was
about
eighteen
and
emancipated
from
schoolroom
supervision
but
not
yet
fairly
entered
upon
the
next
chapter
of
her
existence
for
they
are
among
the
last
she
notices
before
she
came
out
the
date
is
fixed
by
an
entry

appears
on
a
subsequent
page

becomes
more
interesting
than
literature
evidently
for
the
book
ceases
to
be
a
record
of
reading
and
thought
with
an
occasional
note
on
people
and
circumstances
and
becomes
just
the
opposite
a
diary
of
events
interspersed
with
sketches
of
character
and
only
a
rare
allusion
to
literature
but
judging
by
the
number
and
variety
and
the
careful
record
kept
of
the
works
she
read
the
six
months
or
so
immediately
preceding
her
presentation
must
have
been
a
time
of
the
greatest
intellectual
activity
her
father
influence
being
as
usual
often
apparent
as
primary
instigator
once
when
they
were
having
coffee
out
on
the
lawn
after
dinner
he
began
a
discussion
in
her
hearing
about
books
with
another
gentleman
who
was
staying
in
the
house
and
in
the
course
of
it
he
happened
to
praise
roderick
random
and
tom
jones
eloquently
he
said
they
were
superior
in
their
own
line
to
anything
which
the
present
day
has
produced
they
are
true
to
life
in
every
particular
he
maintained
and
not
only
to
the
life
of
those
times
but
of
all
time
in
fact
you
feel
as
you
read
that
it
is
not
fiction
but
human
nature
itself
that
you
are
studying
and
there
is
an
education
in
moral
philosophy
on
every
page
evadne
was
much
impressed
and
being
anxious
to
know
what
an
education
in
moral
philosophy
might
be
she
got
roderick
random
and
tom
jones
out
of
the
library
when
she
went
in
that
evening
and
took
them
to
her
own
room
to
study
they
were
the
two
books
already
referred
to
as
being
among
the
last
she
read
just
before
she
came
out
they
did
not
please
her
but
she
waded
through
them
from
beginning
to
end
conscientiously
nevertheless
and
then
she
made
her
remarks
of
roderick
random
she
wrote
the
hero
is
a
kind
of
young
man
if
a
thing
were
not
right
in
itself
he
acted
as
if
the
pleasure
of
doing
it
sanctified
it
to
his
use
sufficiently
after
a
career
of
vice
in
which
he
revels
without
any
sense
of
personal
degradation
he
marries
an
amiable
girl
named
narcissa
and
everyone
seems
to
expect
that
such
a
union
of
vice
and
virtue
would
be
productive
of
the
happiest
consequences
in
point
of
fact
he
should
have
married
miss
williams
for
whom
he
was
in
every
respect
a
suitable
mate
if
anything
miss
williams
was
the
better
of
the
two
for
roderick
sinned
in
weak
wantonness
while
she
only
did
so
of
necessity
they
repent
together
but
she
is
married
to
an
unsavoury
manservant
named
strap
as
a
reward
while
roderick
considers
himself
entitled
to
the
peerless
narcissa
miss
williams
moreover
becomes
confidential
friend
and
the
whole
disgraceful
arrangement
is
made
possible
by
narcissa
herself
who
calmly
accepts
these
two
precious
associates
at
their
own
valuation
and
admits
them
to
the
closest
intimacy
without
any
knowledge
of
their
true
characters
and
early
lives
the
fine
flavour
of
real
life
in
the
book
seems
to
me
to
be
of
the
putrid
kind
which
some
palates
relish
perhaps
but
it
can
not
be
wholesome
and
it
may
be
poisonous
the
moral
is
be
as
vicious
as
you
please
but
prate
of
virtue
tom
jones
she
dismissed
with
greater
contempt
if
possible
another
young
man
she
wrote
steeped
in
vice
although
acquainted
with
virtue
he
also
marries
a
spotless
heroine
such
men
marrying
are
a
danger
to
the
community
at
large
the
two
books
taken
together
show
well
the
and
injustice
of
men
the
fatal
ignorance
and
slavish
apathy
of
women
and
it
may
be
good
to
know
these
things
but
it
is
not
agreeable
the
ventilation
of
free
discussion
would
doubtless
have
been
an
advantage
to
evadne
at
this
impressionable
period
when
she
was
still
as
it
were
more
an
intellectual
than
a
human
being
travelling
upon
her
head
rather
than
upon
her
heart
so
to
speak
and
one
can
not
help
speculating
about
the
probable
modification
it
would
have
wrought
in
some
of
her
opinions
unfortunately
however
her
family
was
one
of
those
in
which
the
is
rigorously
applied
when
any
attempt
is
made
to
introduce
ideas
which
are
not
already
old
and
accustomed
it
was
as
if
her
people
were
satisfied
that
by
enforcing
silence
they
could
prevent
thought
chapter
iv
it
is
interesting
to
trace
the
steps
by
which
evadne
advanced
one
item
of
knowledge
accidentally
acquired
compelling
her
to
seek
another
as
in
the
case
of
some
disease
mentioned
in
a
the
nature
of
which
she
could
not
comprehend
without
studying
the
construction
of
the
organ
it
affected
but
haphazard
seems
to
have
determined
her
pursuits
much
more
than
design
as
a
rule
some
people
in
after
life
who
liked
her
views
said
they
saw
the
guiding
hand
of
providence
directing
her
course
from
the
first
but
those
who
opposed
her
said
it
was
the
devil
and
others
again
in
idleness
or
charity
or
the
calm
neutrality
of
indifference
set
it
all
down
to
the
inevitable
a
fashionable
first
cause
at
this
time
which
is
both
comprehensive
convenient
and
inoffensive
since
it
may
mean
anything
and
so
suits
itself
to
everybody
prejudices
but
she
certainly
made
her
first
acquaintance
with
anatomy
and
physiology
without
design
of
her
own
her
mother
sent
her
up
to
a
lumber
room
one
day
to
hunt
through
an
old
box
of
books
for
a
story
she
wanted
her
to
read
to
the
children
and
the
box
happened
to
contain
some
medical
works
which
evadne
peeped
into
during
her
search
a
plate
first
attracted
her
attention
and
then
she
read
a
little
to
see
what
the
plate
meant
and
then
she
read
a
little
more
because
the
subject
fascinated
her
and
the
lucid
language
of
a
great
scientific
man
certain
of
his
facts
satisfied
her
and
carried
her
on
insensibly
she
continued
standing
until
one
leg
tired
then
she
rested
on
the
other
then
she
sat
on
the
hard
edge
of
the
box
and
finally
she
subsided
on
to
the
floor
in
the
dust
where
she
was
found
hours
later
still
reading
my
dear
child
where
you
been
her
mother
exclaimed
irritably
when
at
last
she
appeared
i
sent
you
to
get
a
book
to
read
to
the
children
there
it
is
mother
gold
thread
evadne
answered
but
i
can
not
read
to
the
children
until
after
their
tea
they
were
at
their
lessons
this
morning
and
we
are
all
going
out
this
afternoon
she
had
neither
forgotten
the
children
nor
the
time
they
wanted
their
book
which
was
eminently
characteristic
she
never
did
forget
other
people
interests
however
much
she
might
be
absorbed
by
the
pleasure
of
her
own
pursuits
and
i
found
three
other
books
mother
that
i
should
like
to
have
may
i
she
continued
they
are
all
about
our
bones
and
brains
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
digestion
it
says
in
one
of
them
that
muriatic
acid
the
chemical
agent
by
which
the
stomach
dissolves
the
food
is
probably
obtained
from
muriate
of
soda
which
is
common
salt
contained
in
the
blood
is
that
interesting
and
it
says
that
pleasure
not
excitement
you
know
is
the
result
of
the
action
of
living
organs
and
it
goes
on
to
explain
it
shall
i
read
it
to
you
my
dear
child
what
nonsense
have
you
got
hold
of
now
frayling
exclaimed
laughing
it
is
all
here
mother
evadne
remonstrated
tapping
her
books
do
look
at
them
frayling
turned
over
a
few
pages
with
dainty
fingers
tracing
from
without
inward
the
various
coverings
of
the
brain
are
she
read
in
one
the
superior
extremity
consists
of
the
shoulder
the
arm
the
forearm
and
the
hand
she
saw
in
another
harley
also
confirms
the
opinion
of
chaveau
that
the
sugar
is
not
destroyed
in
any
appreciable
quantity
during
its
passage
through
the
tissues
she
learned
from
the
third
oh
how
nasty
she
ejaculated
alluding
to
the
dust
on
the
cover
and
what
a
state
you
are
in
yourself
you
seem
to
have
a
perfect
mania
for
grubbing
up
old
books
what
do
you
want
with
them
you
can
not
possibly
understand
them
why
ca
it
is
all
vanity
you
know
here
take
them
away
but
mother
i
want
to
keep
them
they
ca
do
me
any
harm
if
i
understand
them
you
really
tiresome
evadne
her
mother
rejoined
it
is
quite
bad
taste
to
be
so
persistent
i
am
sorry
mother
i
apologize
but
i
can
read
them
i
suppose
as
you
do
see
anything
objectionable
in
them
do
see
dear
child
that
i
am
trying
to
write
a
letter
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
do
so
while
you
stand
chattering
there
at
my
elbow
you
wo
understand
the
books
but
you
are
too
obstinate
for
anything
and
you
had
better
take
them
and
try
i
do
expect
to
hear
anything
more
about
them
she
added
complacently
as
she
resumed
her
letter
nor
did
she
but
she
felt
the
effect
of
them
strongly
in
after
years
when
evadne
went
out
for
a
ride
with
three
of
her
sisters
that
afternoon
her
mind
was
full
to
overflowing
of
her
morning
studies
and
she
would
liked
to
have
shared
such
interesting
information
with
them
but
they
discouraged
her
is
it
curious
she
began
our
skulls
are
not
all
in
one
piece
when
we
born
i
call
it
simply
said
julia
she
was
the
one
who
screamed
at
a
mouse
you
be
a
bore
if
you
do
mind
cried
evelyn
who
monopolized
the
conversation
as
a
rule
barbara
politely
requested
her
to
shurrup
a
word
of
the
boys
which
she
permitted
herself
to
borrow
in
the
exuberance
of
her
spirits
and
the
sanctity
of
private
life
whenever
evadne
threatened
as
on
the
present
occasion
to
be
kind
evadne
turned
back
then
and
left
them
not
because
they
vexed
her
but
because
she
wanted
to
have
her
head
to
the
wind
and
her
thick
brown
hair
blown
back
out
of
her
eyes
and
full
leisure
to
reflect
upon
her
last
acquisition
as
she
cantered
home
happily
chapter
evadne
was
never
a
great
reader
in
the
sense
of
being
omnivorous
in
her
choice
of
books
but
she
became
a
very
good
one
she
always
had
a
solid
book
in
hand
and
some
standard
work
of
fiction
also
but
she
read
both
with
the
utmost
deliberation
and
with
intellect
clear
and
senses
unaffected
by
anything
after
studying
anatomy
and
physiology
she
took
up
pathology
as
a
matter
of
course
and
naturally
went
on
from
thence
to
prophylactics
and
therapeutics
but
was
quite
unharmed
because
she
made
no
personal
application
of
her
knowledge
as
the
coarser
mind
masculine
of
the
ordinary
medical
student
is
apt
to
do
she
read
of
all
the
diseases
to
which
the
heart
is
subject
and
thought
of
them
familiarly
as
cardiac
affections
without
fancying
she
had
one
of
them
and
she
obtained
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
the
digestive
processes
and
their
ailments
without
realizing
that
her
own
might
ever
be
affected
she
possessed
in
fact
a
mind
of
exceptional
purity
as
well
as
of
exceptional
strength
one
to
be
enlightened
by
knowledge
not
corrupted
but
had
it
been
otherwise
she
must
certainly
have
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
effect
of
the
curiously
foolish
limitations
imposed
upon
her
by
those
who
had
charge
of
her
conventional
education
subjects
were
surrounded
by
mystery
which
should
have
been
explained
an
impossible
ignorance
was
the
object
aimed
at
and
so
long
as
no
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
it
was
supposed
to
be
attained
the
risk
of
making
mysteries
for
an
active
intellect
to
feed
upon
was
never
even
considered
nor
did
anyone
perceive
the
folly
of
withholding
positive
knowledge
which
when
properly
conveyed
is
the
true
source
of
from
a
child
whose
intelligent
perception
was
already
sufficiently
keen
to
require
it
principles
were
dealt
out
to
her
for
one
thing
with
a
generous
want
of
definition
which
must
have
made
them
fatal
to
all
progress
had
she
been
able
to
take
them
intact
her
mother
favourite
and
most
inclusive
dictum
alone
that
everything
is
for
the
best
and
all
things
work
together
for
good
should
have
forced
her
to
a
matter
of
fact
acceptance
of
wickedness
as
a
thing
inevitable
which
it
would
be
waste
of
time
to
oppose
since
it
was
bound
to
resolve
itself
into
something
satisfactory
in
the
end
like
the
objectionable
refuse
which
can
be
converted
by
ingenious
processes
into
an
excellent
substitute
for
butter
but
she
was
saved
from
the
stultification
of
such
a
position
by
finding
it
impossible
to
reconcile
it
practically
with
the
constant
opposition
which
she
found
herself
at
the
same
time
enjoined
to
oppose
to
so
many
things
if
everything
is
for
the
best
it
appeared
to
her
clearly
we
can
not
logically
oppose
ourselves
to
anything
and
there
must
accordingly
be
two
trinities
in
ethics
good
better
best
and
bad
worse
worst
which
it
is
impossible
to
condense
into
one
comprehensive
axiom
but
most
noticeably
prominent
to
her
credit
through
all
this
period
are
the
same
desirable
characteristics
that
provisional
acceptance
already
noticed
of
what
she
was
taught
by
those
whom
she
delighted
to
honor
and
obey
and
the
absence
of
prejudice
which
enabled
her
to
differ
from
them
when
she
saw
good
cause
without
antagonism
drop
the
subject
when
you
do
not
agree
there
is
no
need
to
be
bitter
because
you
know
you
are
right
was
the
maxim
she
used
in
ordinary
social
intercourse
but
she
was
at
the
same
time
forming
principles
to
be
acted
upon
in
opposition
to
everybody
when
occasion
called
for
action
another
noticeable
point
too
was
the
way
in
which
her
mind
returned
from
every
excursion
into
no
matter
what
abstruse
region
of
research
to
the
position
of
women
her
original
point
of
departure
withholding
education
from
women
was
the
original
sin
of
man
she
concludes
mind
as
creator
appealed
to
her
less
than
mind
as
recorder
reasoner
and
ruler
and
for
one
gem
of
poetry
or
other
beauty
of
purely
literary
value
which
she
quotes
there
are
fifty
records
of
principles
of
action
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
was
her
favourite
pastime
her
principal
pleasure
in
life
and
there
were
no
doubts
of
her
own
ability
to
disturb
her
so
long
as
there
was
no
unfortunately
however
for
her
tranquillity
the
had
to
come
she
approached
the
verge
of
womanhood
she
was
made
to
do
up
her
hair
she
was
encouraged
to
think
of
being
presented
coming
out
and
having
a
home
of
her
own
eventually
her
liberty
of
action
was
sensibly
curtailed
but
all
supervision
in
the
matter
of
her
mental
pursuits
was
withdrawn
she
had
received
the
accustomed
education
for
a
girl
in
her
position
which
her
parents
held
without
knowing
it
themselves
perhaps
to
consist
for
the
most
part
in
being
taught
to
know
better
than
to
read
anything
which
they
would
have
considered
objectionable
but
the
end
of
the
supervision
which
should
have
been
a
joy
to
her
brought
the
first
sudden
sense
of
immensity
and
was
chilling
she
perceived
that
the
world
is
large
and
strong
and
that
she
was
small
and
weak
that
knowledge
is
infinite
capacity
indifferent
life
short
and
then
came
the
inevitable
moment
she
does
not
say
what
caused
the
first
overwhelming
sense
of
self
in
her
own
case
but
the
change
it
wrought
is
evident
and
the
disheartening
doubts
with
which
it
was
accompanied
are
expressed
she
picks
her
flower
in
the
crannied
wall
and
realizes
her
own
limitations
but
if
i
could
understand
what
you
are
root
and
all
and
all
in
all
i
should
know
what
god
and
man
is
and
from
this
time
forward
there
is
less
literature
and
more
life
in
the
commonplace
book
chapter
vi
and
lady
adeline
with
the
inevitable
twins
came
constantly
to
fraylingay
while
evadne
was
in
the
schoolroom
and
generally
during
the
holidays
that
she
might
be
at
liberty
to
look
after
the
twins
whose
moral
obliquities
she
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
control
better
than
anybody
else
they
once
told
their
mother
that
they
liked
evadne
because
she
was
so
good
and
lady
adeline
had
a
delicious
moment
of
hope
if
the
twins
had
begun
to
appreciate
goodness
they
would
be
better
themselves
directly
she
was
thinking
when
diavolo
exclaimed
we
can
shock
her
easier
than
anybody
and
hope
died
prematurely
they
had
been
a
source
of
interest
and
also
of
some
concern
to
evadne
from
the
first
she
took
a
grave
view
of
their
vagaries
and
entertained
doubts
on
the
subject
of
their
salvation
should
an
providence
catch
them
peering
into
a
sewer
resolve
itself
into
a
poisonous
gas
and
cut
them
off
suddenly
a
fate
which
had
actually
overtaken
a
small
brother
of
her
own
who
was
not
a
good
little
boy
either
a
fact
which
was
the
cause
of
much
painful
reflection
to
evadne
she
understood
all
about
the
drain
and
the
poisonous
gas
but
she
could
not
fit
in
the
providence
acting
only
for
the
best
which
was
introduced
as
primary
agent
in
the
sad
affair
by
their
dear
campbell
as
her
mother
called
him
in
a
most
touching
and
strengthening
discourse
he
delivered
from
the
pulpit
on
the
subject
if
binny
were
naughty
and
binny
naughty
beyond
all
hope
of
redemption
according
to
the
books
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
for
he
not
only
committed
one
but
each
and
every
sin
sufficient
in
itself
for
condemnation
all
in
one
day
too
when
he
could
and
twice
over
if
there
were
time
he
disobeyed
orders
he
fought
cads
he
stole
apples
he
told
lies
in
fact
he
preferred
to
tell
lies
truth
had
no
charm
for
him
and
all
these
things
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
regularly
to
the
best
of
his
ability
when
he
was
cut
off
and
how
such
an
end
could
be
all
for
the
best
if
the
wicked
must
perish
and
it
is
not
good
to
perish
was
the
puzzle
there
was
something
she
could
not
grasp
of
a
contradictory
nature
in
it
all
that
tormented
her
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
might
have
been
a
help
but
she
had
not
heard
of
it
she
told
the
twins
the
story
of
binny
sad
end
once
in
the
orthodox
way
as
a
warning
but
the
warning
was
the
only
part
of
it
which
failed
to
impress
them
and
do
you
know
she
said
solemnly
there
were
some
green
apples
found
in
his
pockets
after
he
was
dead
actually
what
a
pity
diavolo
exclaimed
if
they
had
been
found
in
his
stomach
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
satisfactory
how
did
he
get
the
apples
off
the
tree
or
out
of
the
storeroom
i
do
know
said
evadne
they
would
have
green
apples
in
the
storeroom
angelica
thought
oh
yes
they
might
diavolo
considered
those
big
cooking
fellows
you
know
they
green
enough
but
they
not
nice
said
angelica
no
but
you
do
think
of
that
till
you
got
them
was
the
outcome
of
diavolo
experience
is
your
storeroom
on
the
ground
floor
he
asked
evadne
no
she
answered
is
there
a
creeper
outside
the
window
he
pursued
no
creepers
wo
grow
because
a
big
lime
tree
hangs
it
the
children
exchanged
glances
i
should
have
made
that
room
a
storeroom
said
angelica
lime
trees
bring
flies
there
something
flies
like
on
the
leaves
but
any
tree
will
bring
flies
if
you
smear
the
leaves
with
sweet
stuff
said
diavolo
you
remember
that
outside
papa
dressing
room
window
angelica
yes
she
said
thoughtfully
he
had
to
turn
out
of
his
dressing
room
this
summer
he
could
stand
them
but
was
binny
often
caught
evadne
diavolo
asked
often
she
said
and
punished
but
i
suppose
he
had
generally
eaten
the
apples
angelica
suggested
anxiously
it
better
to
eat
them
at
once
sighed
diavolo
did
you
say
he
did
everything
he
was
told
not
to
do
yes
i
expect
when
he
was
told
not
to
do
a
thing
he
could
not
think
of
anything
else
until
he
done
it
said
angelica
and
now
he
in
heaven
diavolo
speculated
looking
up
through
the
window
with
big
bright
eyes
pathetically
the
twins
thought
a
good
deal
about
heaven
in
their
own
way
lady
adeline
did
not
like
them
to
be
talked
to
on
the
subject
they
were
indefatigable
explorers
and
it
was
popularly
supposed
that
only
the
difficulty
of
being
present
at
an
inquest
on
their
own
bodies
which
they
would
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
had
kept
them
so
far
from
trying
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
next
world
they
discovered
the
storeroom
at
fraylingay
half
an
hour
after
they
had
discussed
the
improving
details
of
binny
exciting
career
and
had
found
it
quite
easy
of
access
by
means
of
the
available
lime
tree
they
both
suffered
a
good
deal
that
night
and
they
thought
of
binny
but
there
nothing
in
pockets
that
one
comfort
diavolo
exclaimed
suddenly
to
the
astonishment
of
his
mother
who
was
sitting
up
with
him
angelica
heaved
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
evadne
patience
with
the
twins
was
wonderful
she
always
took
charge
of
them
cheerfully
on
wet
days
and
in
other
times
of
trouble
and
managed
them
with
infinite
tact
how
do
you
do
it
my
dear
lady
adeline
asked
do
you
talk
to
them
and
tell
them
stories
no
said
evadne
i
do
talk
much
i
just
do
lose
sight
of
them
or
interfere
if
i
can
possibly
help
it
the
twins
had
no
reverence
for
anything
or
anybody
one
day
they
were
in
evadne
little
sitting
room
which
overlooked
the
courtyard
it
was
an
antechamber
to
her
bedroom
and
peculiarly
her
own
by
right
of
primogeniture
nobody
ever
thought
of
going
there
without
her
special
permission
except
of
course
the
twins
but
even
they
assumed
hypocritical
airs
of
innocent
apology
for
accidental
intrusion
when
they
wanted
to
make
things
pleasant
for
themselves
on
this
particular
occasion
evadne
was
sitting
beside
her
little
busy
with
her
needle
and
the
twins
were
standing
together
looking
out
of
the
window
there
papa
said
diavolo
he
going
for
a
ride
said
angelica
does
he
mount
queerly
diavolo
observed
he
be
safer
in
a
bath
chair
not
if
we
were
wheeling
him
angelica
suggested
with
a
chuckle
what
shall
we
do
yawned
diavolo
shall
we
fight
yes
let
said
angelica
you
must
do
no
such
thing
evadne
interfered
not
fight
why
angelica
demanded
we
fight
you
know
diavolo
asserted
i
do
see
that
said
evadne
why
should
you
fight
it
good
for
the
circulation
of
the
blood
said
angelica
warms
a
body
you
know
and
there
the
property
too
said
diavolo
we
got
to
fight
for
that
evadne
did
not
understand
so
angelica
kindly
explained
you
see
i
the
eldest
but
diavolo
a
boy
so
he
gets
the
property
because
of
the
entail
and
we
neither
of
us
think
it
fair
so
we
fight
for
it
and
whichever
wins
is
to
have
it
i
won
the
last
battle
so
it
mine
just
now
but
diavolo
may
win
it
back
if
we
fight
again
before
papa
dies
why
he
wants
to
fight
now
i
expect
yes
diavolo
candidly
confessed
but
we
generally
fight
when
we
see
papa
go
out
for
a
ride
because
you
are
afraid
he
will
catch
you
and
punish
you
as
you
deserve
if
he
at
home
i
suppose
you
bad
children
not
at
all
said
angelica
it
because
he
looks
so
unsafe
on
a
horse
you
never
know
what
happen
it
a
kind
of
a
last
chance
said
diavolo
and
that
makes
it
exciting
but
would
you
be
very
sorry
if
your
father
died
evadne
asked
the
twins
looked
at
each
other
doubtfully
should
we
diavolo
said
to
angelica
i
wonder
said
angelica
one
wet
day
they
chose
to
paint
in
evadne
room
because
they
could
not
go
out
she
found
pictures
and
got
everything
ready
for
them
and
then
they
sat
themselves
down
at
a
little
table
opposite
each
other
but
the
weather
affected
their
spirits
and
made
them
both
fractious
they
wanted
the
same
picture
to
begin
with
and
only
settled
the
question
by
demolishing
it
in
their
attempts
to
snatch
it
from
each
other
then
there
was
only
one
left
between
them
but
happily
they
remembered
that
artists
sometimes
work
at
the
same
picture
and
it
further
occurred
to
them
that
it
would
be
an
original
method
or
funny
as
they
phrased
it
for
one
of
them
to
work
at
it
wrong
side
up
so
angelica
daubed
the
sky
blue
on
her
side
of
the
table
and
diavolo
flung
green
on
the
fields
from
his
they
had
large
genial
mouths
at
that
time
indefinite
noses
threatening
to
turn
up
a
little
and
bright
dark
eyes
quick
glancing
but
with
no
particular
expression
in
them
no
symptom
either
of
love
or
hate
nothing
but
living
interest
it
was
pretty
to
see
diavolo
fair
head
touching
angelica
dark
one
across
the
little
table
but
when
it
came
too
close
angelica
would
dunt
it
sharply
out
of
the
way
with
her
own
which
was
apparently
the
harder
of
the
two
and
diavolo
would
put
up
his
hand
and
rub
the
spot
absently
he
was
too
thoroughly
accustomed
to
such
sisterly
attentions
to
be
altogether
conscious
of
them
the
weather
darkened
down
i
wish
i
could
see
he
grumbled
get
out
of
your
own
light
said
angelica
how
can
i
get
out
of
my
own
light
when
there
is
any
light
to
get
out
of
angelica
put
her
paint
brush
in
her
mouth
and
looked
up
at
the
window
thoughtfully
let
make
it
into
a
song
she
said
let
said
diavolo
intent
upon
making
blue
and
yellow
into
green
no
light
have
we
and
that
we
do
resent
and
learning
this
the
weather
will
relent
repent
relent
angelica
sang
diavolo
paused
with
his
brush
halfway
to
his
mouth
and
nodded
intelligently
now
said
angelica
and
they
repeated
the
parody
together
angelica
making
a
perfect
second
to
diavolo
exquisite
treble
evadne
looked
up
from
her
work
surprised
her
own
voice
was
contralto
but
it
would
have
taken
her
a
week
to
learn
to
sing
a
second
from
the
notes
and
she
had
never
dreamt
of
making
one
i
did
know
you
could
sing
she
said
oh
yes
we
can
sing
angelica
answered
cheerfully
we
a
decided
talent
for
music
angelica
can
make
a
song
in
a
moment
said
diavolo
let
me
paint
your
nose
green
evadne
you
can
paint
mine
if
you
like
said
angelica
no
i
sha
i
shall
paint
my
own
no
you
paint
mine
and
i
paint
yours
angelica
suggested
well
both
together
then
diavolo
answered
honest
injin
angelica
agreed
and
they
set
to
work
evadne
sat
with
her
embroidery
in
her
lap
and
watched
them
their
faces
would
have
to
be
washed
in
any
case
and
they
might
as
well
be
washed
for
an
acre
as
for
an
inch
of
paint
she
never
nagged
with
do
do
this
and
do
do
that
about
everything
if
their
offences
could
be
summed
up
and
wiped
out
in
some
such
way
all
at
once
we
sing
you
an
anthem
some
day
angelica
presently
promised
why
not
now
said
evadne
the
spirit
does
not
move
us
diavolo
answered
but
you
may
forget
said
evadne
we
never
forget
our
promises
angelica
protested
as
proudly
as
was
possible
with
a
green
nose
nor
did
they
curiously
enough
they
made
a
point
of
keeping
their
word
but
in
their
own
way
and
this
one
was
kept
in
due
course
the
time
they
chose
was
when
a
certain
grand
duke
was
staying
in
the
house
they
had
quite
captivated
him
and
he
expressed
a
wish
to
hear
them
sing
shall
we
said
diavolo
we
will
said
angelica
not
because
he
a
prince
but
because
we
promised
evadne
an
anthem
and
we
might
as
well
do
it
now
she
added
with
true
british
independence
the
prince
chuckled
what
shall
it
be
said
diavolo
settling
himself
at
the
piano
he
always
played
the
accompaniments
i
think
said
angelica
what
is
lady
adeline
asked
anxiously
very
nice
or
you
would
have
married
him
answered
angelica
go
on
diavolo
if
you
sing
flat
i
slap
you
if
you
impertinent
miss
i
put
you
out
diavolo
retorted
go
on
said
evadne
sharply
fearing
a
fight
but
to
everybody
intense
relief
the
prince
laughed
and
then
the
distinguished
manners
appeared
in
a
new
and
agreeable
light
papa
they
sang
says
that
we
that
we
that
we
are
little
devils
and
so
we
are
we
are
we
are
and
ever
shall
be
world
without
am
a
diavolo
trilled
exquisitely
am
a
art
a
chip
thou
art
a
angelica
responded
are
both
they
concluded
harmoniously
of
the
old
old
block
and
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
and
ever
shall
be
world
without
end
amen
you
sang
that
last
phrase
flat
you
cried
angelica
i
ca
both
sing
and
play
diavolo
protested
you
say
you
ca
eat
and
breathe
next
she
retorted
giving
his
hair
a
tug
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
demanded
just
to
waken
you
up
she
answered
are
they
always
like
this
the
prince
asked
much
edified
this
is
nothing
groaned
nothing
if
it
is
not
genius
the
prince
suggested
gracefully
the
ineffectual
genius
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
fancy
which
betrays
itself
by
strange
incongruities
and
contrasts
of
a
violent
kind
but
is
otherwise
unproductive
orton
beg
whispered
to
frayling
incautiously
lady
adeline
looked
up
i
could
not
help
hearing
she
said
oh
adeline
i
am
sorry
orton
beg
exclaimed
thank
you
said
lady
adeline
sighing
courtly
phrases
are
pleasant
plums
even
to
palates
which
are
losing
all
taste
for
such
dainties
but
they
are
not
nourishing
i
would
rather
know
my
children
to
be
merely
naughty
and
spend
my
time
in
trying
to
make
them
good
than
falsely
flatter
myself
that
there
is
anything
great
in
them
and
indulge
them
on
that
plea
until
i
had
thoroughly
confirmed
them
in
faults
which
i
ought
to
have
been
rigorously
repressing
you
right
there
said
frayling
but
all
the
same
you
be
able
to
make
a
good
deal
of
that
boy
or
i
much
mistaken
and
as
for
angelica
why
when
she
is
at
the
head
of
an
establishment
of
her
own
she
will
require
all
her
smartness
but
teach
her
housekeeping
lady
adeline
that
is
the
thing
for
evadne
was
sitting
near
her
father
not
taking
part
in
the
conversation
but
attending
to
it
and
lady
adeline
happening
to
look
at
her
at
this
moment
saw
something
which
gave
her
pause
to
ponder
evadne
face
recalled
somewhat
the
type
of
old
egypt
egypt
with
an
intellect
added
her
eyes
were
long
and
apparently
narrow
but
not
so
in
reality
a
trick
she
had
of
holding
them
half
shut
habitually
gave
a
false
impression
of
their
size
and
veiled
the
penetration
of
their
glance
also
which
was
exceptionally
keen
in
moments
of
emotion
however
she
would
open
them
to
the
full
unexpectedly
and
then
the
effect
was
startling
and
peculiar
and
it
was
one
of
these
transient
flashes
which
surprised
lady
adeline
when
frayling
made
that
last
remark
it
was
a
mere
gleam
but
it
revealed
evadne
to
lady
adeline
as
a
flash
of
lightning
might
have
revealed
a
familiar
landscape
on
a
dark
night
she
saw
what
she
expected
to
see
but
all
transformed
and
she
saw
something
beyond
which
she
did
not
expect
and
could
neither
comprehend
nor
forget
so
far
she
had
only
thought
of
evadne
as
a
nice
quiet
little
thing
with
nothing
particular
in
her
from
that
evening
however
she
suspended
her
opinion
suspecting
something
but
waiting
to
know
more
evadne
was
then
in
her
eighteenth
year
but
not
yet
out
chapter
vii
orton
beg
was
a
sister
of
frayling
and
an
oracle
to
evadne
frayling
was
fair
plump
sweet
yielding
commonplace
prolific
orton
beg
was
a
barren
widow
slender
sincere
silent
firm
and
tender
frayling
for
lack
of
insight
was
unsympathetic
orton
beg
was
just
the
opposite
and
she
and
evadne
understood
each
other
and
were
silent
together
in
the
most
companionable
way
in
the
world
when
evadne
went
to
her
own
room
on
the
evening
made
memorable
by
the
twins
famous
anthem
she
was
haunted
by
that
word
ineffectual
which
orton
beg
had
used
ineffectual
genius
there
was
something
familiar
as
well
as
high
sounding
in
the
epithet
it
recalled
an
idea
with
which
she
was
already
acquainted
what
was
it
she
opened
her
commonplace
book
and
sat
with
her
pen
in
her
hand
cogitating
comfortably
she
had
no
need
to
weary
her
fresh
young
brain
with
an
irritating
pursuit
of
what
she
wanted
she
had
only
to
wait
and
it
would
recur
to
her
and
presently
it
came
her
countenance
brightened
she
bent
over
the
book
and
wrote
a
few
lines
read
them
when
she
had
blotted
them
and
was
satisfied
i
have
it
she
wrote
shelley
genius
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
ineffectual
angel
beating
in
the
void
his
luminous
wings
in
vain
when
she
had
done
this
she
took
up
a
book
went
to
the
fire
settled
herself
in
an
and
began
to
read
the
book
was
ruth
by
gaskell
and
she
was
just
finishing
it
when
she
had
done
so
she
went
back
to
the
table
and
copied
out
the
following
paragraph
the
daily
life
into
which
people
are
born
and
into
which
they
are
absorbed
before
they
are
aware
forms
chains
which
only
one
in
a
hundred
has
moral
strength
enough
to
despise
and
to
break
when
the
right
time
comes
when
an
inward
necessity
for
independent
action
arises
which
is
superior
to
all
outward
conventionalities
she
stopped
here
and
pushed
the
volume
away
from
her
it
was
the
only
passage
in
it
which
she
cared
to
remember
she
had
lost
the
confidence
of
the
child
by
this
time
and
become
humbly
doubtful
of
her
own
opinion
and
instead
of
summing
up
ruth
boldly
as
she
would
have
done
the
year
before
she
paused
now
a
moment
to
reflect
before
she
wrote
with
diffidence
the
principal
impression
this
book
has
made
upon
me
is
that
gaskell
must
have
been
a
very
lovable
woman
footnote
george
eliot
thought
so
too
years
before
evadne
was
born
and
expressed
the
thought
in
a
letter
in
which
she
also
prophesied
that
ruth
would
not
live
through
a
generation
the
impression
the
book
made
upon
evadne
is
another
proof
of
prescience
in
the
great
writer
the
story
seems
to
me
long
drawn
out
and
of
small
significance
it
is
full
of
food
for
the
heart
but
the
head
goes
empty
away
and
both
should
be
satisfied
by
a
work
of
fiction
i
think
but
perhaps
it
is
my
own
mood
that
is
at
fault
at
another
time
i
might
have
found
gems
in
it
which
now
in
my
dulness
i
have
failed
to
perceive
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
as
she
blotted
the
words
come
in
auntie
she
said
as
if
in
answer
to
an
accustomed
signal
and
orton
beg
entered
in
a
long
loose
voluminously
draped
white
wrapper
evadne
drew
an
to
the
fire
for
her
sit
down
auntie
she
said
and
be
cosey
you
are
late
i
was
afraid
you
were
not
coming
orton
beg
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
evadne
room
every
evening
when
she
was
at
fraylingay
to
chat
or
sit
silently
sociable
over
the
fire
with
her
before
saying
goodnight
do
i
ever
fail
you
she
asked
smiling
no
but
i
have
been
afraid
of
the
fatal
fascination
of
that
great
fat
foreign
prince
he
singled
you
out
for
special
attention
and
i
have
been
jealous
well
you
need
not
have
been
for
he
singled
me
out
in
order
to
talk
about
you
he
thinks
you
are
a
nice
child
you
interest
him
defend
me
said
evadne
but
you
mistake
me
dear
aunt
it
was
not
of
him
i
was
jealous
but
of
you
the
fat
prince
is
nothing
to
me
and
you
are
a
very
great
deal
orton
beg
face
brightened
at
the
words
but
she
continued
to
look
into
the
fire
silently
for
some
seconds
after
evadne
had
spoken
and
made
no
other
visible
sign
of
having
heard
them
i
do
think
i
ought
to
encourage
you
to
sit
up
so
late
she
said
presently
lady
adeline
has
just
been
asking
me
who
it
is
that
burns
the
midnight
oil
up
here
so
regularly
lady
adeline
must
be
up
very
late
herself
to
see
it
said
evadne
i
suppose
those
precious
twins
disturb
her
i
wish
she
would
let
me
take
entire
charge
of
them
when
she
is
here
it
would
be
a
relief
i
should
think
it
would
be
an
imposition
said
orton
beg
but
you
are
a
brave
girl
evadne
would
not
venture
oh
they
delight
me
evadne
answered
and
i
know
them
well
enough
now
to
forestall
them
when
i
told
lady
adeline
that
these
were
your
rooms
her
aunt
pursued
she
said
something
about
a
lily
maid
high
in
her
chamber
up
a
tower
to
the
east
guarding
the
sacred
shield
of
lancelot
singularly
inappropriate
said
evadne
for
my
tower
is
south
and
west
thank
heaven
and
there
is
a
symptom
of
lancelot
her
aunt
concluded
young
ladies
do
guard
sacred
shields
nowadays
said
evadne
no
answered
her
aunt
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
open
book
on
the
table
they
have
substituted
the
sacred
book
full
of
thought
i
fancy
you
speak
regretfully
auntie
but
is
it
better
to
think
and
be
happy
than
to
die
of
atrophy
for
a
sentiment
i
do
think
it
better
to
extinguish
all
sentiment
life
without
sentiment
would
be
so
bald
but
life
with
that
kind
of
sentiment
does
last
it
seems
and
nobody
is
benefited
by
it
it
is
extreme
misery
to
the
girl
herself
and
she
dies
young
leaving
a
legacy
of
lifelong
regret
and
bitterness
to
her
friends
i
should
think
it
small
comfort
to
become
the
subject
for
a
poem
or
a
picture
at
such
a
price
and
surely
auntie
sentiments
which
are
silly
or
dangerous
would
be
better
extinguished
orton
beg
smiled
at
the
fire
enigmatically
but
the
poem
or
the
picture
may
become
a
lasting
benefit
to
mankind
she
suggested
presently
humph
said
evadne
you
doubt
it
well
you
see
auntie
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it
when
you
first
come
across
the
poem
or
the
picture
which
perpetuates
the
sentiment
that
slew
the
girl
and
beautifies
it
you
feel
a
glow
all
over
and
fancy
you
would
like
to
imitate
her
and
think
that
you
would
deserve
great
credit
for
it
if
you
did
but
when
you
come
to
consider
there
is
nothing
very
noble
after
all
in
a
hopeless
passion
for
an
elderly
man
of
the
world
who
is
past
being
benefited
by
it
even
if
he
could
reciprocate
it
elaine
should
have
married
a
man
of
her
own
age
and
made
him
happy
she
would
have
done
some
good
in
her
time
so
and
been
saved
from
setting
us
a
bad
example
i
think
it
a
sin
to
make
unwholesome
sentiments
attractive
then
lancelot
does
not
charm
you
no
said
evadne
thoughtfully
i
should
have
preferred
the
king
ah
yes
because
he
was
the
nobler
the
more
ideal
man
no
not
exactly
evadne
answered
but
because
he
was
the
more
wholesome
my
dear
child
are
you
speaking
literally
yes
auntie
good
heavens
orton
beg
ejaculated
softly
the
times
changed
yes
we
know
more
now
evadne
answered
tranquilly
you
are
fulfilling
the
promise
of
your
youth
evadne
her
aunt
remarked
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
remember
reading
a
fairy
tale
of
jean
ingelow
aloud
to
you
children
in
the
nursery
long
ago
i
forget
the
name
of
it
but
it
was
the
one
into
which
morning
oh
so
early
comes
and
you
started
a
controversy
as
to
whether
speaking
of
the
dove
when
the
lark
said
us
glory
she
should
have
made
answer
us
peace
or
the
latter
you
maintained
as
being
the
more
natural
and
the
most
sensible
i
must
have
been
a
horrid
little
prig
in
those
days
said
evadne
smiling
but
auntie
there
can
be
no
peace
without
plenty
and
i
think
i
would
rather
be
a
sensible
realist
than
a
foolish
idealist
you
mean
that
you
think
me
too
much
of
a
utilitarian
do
you
not
you
are
in
danger
i
think
utilitarianism
is
bentham
happiness
is
it
not
evadne
asked
yes
greatest
human
happiness
her
aunt
replied
well
i
do
know
how
that
can
be
dangerous
in
principle
but
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
such
questions
practically
only
i
do
seem
to
perceive
that
you
must
rest
on
a
solid
basis
of
real
advantages
before
you
can
reach
up
to
ideal
perfection
with
any
chance
of
success
you
seem
to
be
very
wide
awake
evadne
orton
beg
rejoined
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
your
peculiar
views
oh
i
am
a
kind
of
owl
i
think
auntie
evadne
answered
apologetically
you
see
i
never
had
anything
to
do
in
the
schoolroom
that
i
could
not
manage
when
i
was
half
asleep
and
so
i
formed
a
habit
of
dozing
over
my
lessons
by
day
and
waking
up
when
i
came
to
bed
at
night
having
a
room
of
my
own
always
has
been
a
great
advantage
i
have
been
secure
all
along
of
a
quiet
time
at
night
for
reading
and
thought
and
that
is
real
life
auntie
is
it
i
do
care
to
talk
much
as
a
rule
do
you
i
like
to
listen
and
watch
people
but
i
always
wake
up
at
this
time
of
the
night
and
i
feel
as
if
i
could
be
quite
garrulous
now
when
everybody
else
is
going
to
sleep
but
auntie
do
use
such
an
ominous
expression
as
views
about
anything
i
say
are
always
in
ill
odour
and
peculiarities
even
peculiar
perfections
would
isolate
one
and
that
i
dread
it
would
be
awful
to
be
out
of
sympathy
with
one
and
have
them
look
suspiciously
at
one
and
it
would
be
no
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
want
of
sympathy
is
the
proof
of
a
narrow
nature
and
that
suspicion
is
the
inevitable
outcome
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
i
do
want
to
despise
my
i
would
rather
share
their
ignorance
and
conceit
and
be
sociable
than
find
myself
isolated
even
by
a
very
real
superiority
the
one
would
be
pleasant
enough
i
should
think
the
other
pain
beyond
all
bearing
of
it
orton
beg
heart
contracted
with
a
momentary
fear
for
her
niece
but
she
dismissed
it
promptly
the
room
to
yourself
has
been
a
doubtful
advantage
i
fancy
she
said
it
has
made
you
theoretical
but
you
will
lose
all
that
by
and
by
and
in
the
meantime
you
must
remember
that
in
such
matters
we
have
small
choice
we
are
born
with
superior
or
inferior
faculties
and
must
make
use
of
them
such
as
they
are
to
become
inferior
cooks
or
countesses
or
superior
ditto
as
the
case
may
be
but
there
are
always
plenty
of
one
own
kind
whichever
it
is
to
consort
with
birds
of
a
feather
you
know
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
isolated
you
are
thinking
of
ordinary
faculties
auntie
i
was
thinking
of
extraordinary
but
even
with
ordinary
ones
we
are
hampered
birds
of
a
feather
would
flock
together
if
they
could
of
course
but
then
they
always
and
suppose
being
superior
you
find
yourself
forced
to
associate
with
inferior
cooks
of
your
kind
what
then
be
their
queen
which
unless
you
were
a
queen
of
hearts
would
really
amount
to
being
an
object
of
envy
and
dislike
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
evadne
you
talk
like
a
book
go
to
bed
orton
beg
exclaimed
laughing
it
is
you
who
have
made
me
talk
then
evadne
rejoined
promptly
and
i
feel
inclined
to
ask
now
with
all
proper
respect
what
has
come
to
you
it
must
be
the
prince
yes
it
must
be
the
prince
orton
beg
responded
raising
her
slender
white
hand
to
smother
a
yawn
and
it
must
be
too
or
rather
just
look
at
the
clock
it
is
nearly
three
chapter
viii
the
next
morning
all
the
guests
left
fraylingay
and
the
family
there
settled
into
their
accustomed
grooves
evadne
and
her
father
walked
and
rode
conversing
together
as
usual
he
enjoying
the
roll
and
rumble
and
fine
flavour
of
his
own
amazingly
and
she
also
impressed
by
the
roll
and
rumble
but
when
it
was
all
over
and
he
had
marched
off
in
triumph
she
would
collect
the
mutilated
remains
of
the
argument
and
examine
them
at
her
leisure
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
proved
to
be
quartz
that
he
had
crushed
and
contemned
overlooking
the
gold
it
contained
but
releasing
it
for
her
to
find
and
add
exultingly
to
her
own
collection
in
this
way
therefore
she
continued
to
obtain
her
wealth
of
ore
from
him
and
both
were
satisfied
he
because
he
was
sure
that
thanks
to
him
she
was
a
thoroughly
sensible
girl
with
no
nonsense
of
notions
about
her
and
she
because
being
his
daughter
she
had
not
altogether
escaped
the
form
of
mental
myopia
from
which
he
suffered
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
only
what
she
hoped
and
wished
to
see
in
those
she
loved
man
the
unjust
and
iniquitous
was
to
her
always
the
outside
vague
theoretical
man
of
the
world
never
the
dear
undoubted
papa
at
home
evadne
was
the
eldest
of
six
girls
and
their
mother
had
a
comfortable
feeling
about
them
all
but
she
prided
herself
most
upon
evadne
as
answering
in
every
particular
to
the
conventional
idea
of
what
a
young
lady
should
be
the
dear
child
she
wrote
to
lady
adeline
is
and
than
we
dared
to
hope
to
have
her
become
i
can
assure
you
she
has
never
caused
me
a
moment
anxiety
in
her
life
except
of
course
such
anxiety
for
her
health
and
happiness
as
every
mother
must
feel
i
have
had
her
educated
with
the
utmost
care
and
her
father
has
i
may
say
himself
to
the
task
of
influencing
her
in
the
right
direction
in
matters
of
opinion
and
has
ably
seconded
all
my
endeavours
in
other
respects
she
speaks
french
and
german
and
knows
a
little
italian
in
fact
i
may
say
that
she
has
a
special
aptitude
for
languages
she
does
not
draw
but
is
a
fair
musician
and
is
still
having
lessons
being
most
anxious
to
improve
herself
and
she
sings
very
sweetly
but
best
of
all
as
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
i
notice
in
her
a
deeply
religious
disposition
she
is
devout
and
beautifully
reverential
in
her
manner
both
in
church
and
to
us
her
parents
and
indeed
to
all
who
are
older
and
wiser
than
herself
she
is
very
clever
too
they
tell
me
but
of
course
i
am
no
judge
of
that
i
do
know
however
that
she
is
perfectly
innocent
and
i
am
indeed
thankful
to
think
that
at
eighteen
she
knows
nothing
of
the
world
and
its
wickedness
and
is
therefore
eminently
qualified
to
make
somebody
an
excellent
wife
and
all
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
the
destined
somebody
will
come
for
her
all
too
soon
for
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
parting
with
her
she
is
not
like
other
girls
in
things
i
am
afraid
mere
trifles
however
as
for
instance
about
her
presentation
i
know
was
in
quite
a
flutter
of
excitement
for
days
before
was
presented
and
was
quite
bewildered
with
agitation
at
the
time
but
evadne
displayed
no
emotion
whatever
i
never
knew
so
equable
as
she
is
in
fact
seems
to
ruffle
her
wonderful
calm
it
is
almost
provoking
sometimes
on
the
way
home
she
would
not
have
made
a
remark
i
think
if
i
had
not
spoken
to
her
you
think
it
was
a
very
pretty
sight
i
said
at
last
she
answered
doubtfully
and
then
she
added
with
genuine
feeling
il
y
a
des
longuers
oh
mother
the
hours
we
have
spent
hanging
about
draughty
corridors
half
dressed
and
shivering
with
cold
and
the
crowding
and
crushing
and
unlovely
faces
all
looking
so
miserable
and
showing
the
discomfort
and
fatigue
they
were
enduring
so
plainly
i
call
it
positive
suffering
and
i
never
want
to
see
another
drawing
room
my
soul
desires
nothing
now
but
decent
clothing
and
hot
tea
and
that
is
all
she
has
ever
said
about
the
drawing
room
in
my
hearing
but
was
it
a
very
curious
view
for
a
girl
to
take
of
course
the
arrangements
are
detestable
and
one
does
suffer
a
great
deal
from
cold
and
fatigue
and
for
want
of
refreshments
but
still
never
thought
of
those
things
when
was
a
girl
did
you
i
never
thought
of
anything
in
fact
but
whether
i
was
looking
my
best
or
not
do
let
me
make
you
imagine
however
that
evadne
was
whining
and
querulous
she
never
is
you
know
and
i
should
call
her
tone
sorrowful
if
it
were
not
so
absurd
for
a
girl
to
be
saddened
by
the
sight
of
other
people
in
distress
well
not
quite
in
distress
that
is
an
exaggeration
but
at
all
events
not
quite
comfortably
situated
on
what
was
really
one
of
the
greatest
occasions
of
her
own
life
i
am
half
inclined
to
fear
that
she
may
not
be
quite
so
strong
as
we
have
always
thought
her
and
that
she
was
depressed
by
the
long
fasting
and
fatigue
which
would
account
for
a
momentary
morbidness
but
excuse
my
garrulity
i
always
have
so
much
to
say
to
i
will
spare
you
any
more
for
the
present
however
only
do
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
your
own
lovely
children
and
how
is
remember
that
you
are
to
come
to
us
twins
and
all
on
your
way
home
as
usual
this
year
we
are
anxiously
expecting
you
and
i
hope
your
next
letter
will
fix
the
day
ever
dear
adeline
your
loving
friend
elizabeth
frayling
we
return
to
fraylingay
so
please
write
to
me
there
the
following
is
lady
adeline
reply
to
frayling
letter
hamilton
house
morningquest
july
my
dear
elizabeth
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
been
wondering
what
has
become
of
us
but
i
know
you
will
acquit
me
of
all
blame
for
the
long
delay
in
answering
your
letter
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
only
just
received
it
we
had
left
paris
before
it
arrived
for
what
is
always
to
me
a
tiresome
tour
about
the
continent
and
it
has
been
following
us
from
pillar
to
post
finally
reaching
me
here
at
home
where
we
have
been
settled
a
fortnight
i
had
not
forgotten
your
kind
invitation
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
give
up
all
idea
of
going
to
you
this
year
we
hurried
back
because
became
homesick
suddenly
while
we
were
abroad
and
i
do
think
it
will
be
possible
to
get
him
to
move
again
for
some
time
but
wo
you
come
to
us
do
dear
and
bring
your
and
i
am
sure
most
charming
evadne
for
our
autumn
gayeties
if
frayling
would
come
too
we
should
be
delighted
but
i
know
he
has
a
poor
opinion
of
coverts
and
i
despair
of
being
able
to
tempt
him
from
his
own
shooting
and
therefore
i
ask
first
and
foremost
in
the
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
come
whether
he
does
or
not
i
have
been
thinking
much
of
all
you
have
told
me
about
evadne
she
had
already
struck
me
as
being
a
most
interesting
child
and
full
of
promise
and
i
do
hope
that
now
she
is
out
of
the
schoolroom
i
shall
see
more
of
her
i
know
you
will
trust
her
to
me
although
i
do
think
that
in
parts
of
her
education
you
have
been
acting
by
the
half
light
of
a
past
time
and
following
a
method
now
out
of
date
i
can
not
agree
for
instance
that
it
is
either
right
or
wise
to
keep
a
girl
in
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
her
own
being
and
of
the
state
of
the
community
in
which
she
will
have
to
pass
her
existence
while
she
is
at
an
age
to
be
influenced
in
the
right
way
she
should
be
fully
instructed
by
those
she
loves
and
not
left
to
obtain
her
knowledge
of
the
world
haphazard
from
anyone
with
whom
accident
may
bring
her
acquainted
people
perhaps
whose
point
of
view
may
not
only
differ
materially
from
her
parents
but
be
extremely
offensive
to
them
the
first
impression
in
these
matters
you
know
is
all
important
and
my
experience
is
that
what
you
call
innocence
and
what
i
consider
is
not
a
safe
state
in
which
to
begin
the
battle
of
life
in
the
matter
of
marriage
especially
an
ignorant
girl
may
be
fatally
deceived
and
indeed
i
know
cases
in
which
the
man
who
was
liked
well
enough
as
a
companion
was
found
to
be
objectionable
in
an
unendurable
degree
as
soon
as
he
became
a
husband
you
will
think
i
am
tainted
with
new
notions
and
i
do
hope
i
am
in
so
far
as
these
notions
are
juster
and
better
than
the
old
ones
for
surely
the
elder
ages
did
not
discover
all
that
is
wisdom
and
certainly
there
is
still
room
for
modes
of
life
and
manners
purer
laws
if
this
were
not
allowed
moral
progress
must
come
to
a
standstill
so
i
say
instruct
the
knowledge
must
come
sooner
or
later
let
it
come
wholesomely
a
girl
must
find
out
for
herself
if
she
is
not
taught
and
she
may
in
these
times
obtain
a
wholly
erroneous
theory
of
life
and
morality
from
a
newspaper
report
which
she
reads
without
intention
in
an
idle
moment
while
enjoying
her
afternoon
tea
we
are
in
a
state
of
transition
we
women
and
the
air
is
so
full
of
ideas
that
it
would
be
strange
if
an
active
mind
did
not
catch
some
of
them
and
i
find
myself
that
stray
theories
swallowed
whole
without
due
consideration
are
of
uncertain
application
difficult
in
the
working
if
not
impracticable
and
apt
to
disagree
theories
should
be
absorbed
in
detail
as
dinner
is
if
they
are
to
become
an
addition
to
our
strength
and
not
an
indigestible
item
of
inconvenience
seriously
affecting
our
mental
temper
but
you
ask
me
about
my
twins
in
health
they
continue
splendid
in
spirits
they
are
tremendous
but
their
tricks
are
simply
terrible
we
never
know
what
mischief
they
will
devise
next
and
angelica
is
much
the
worst
of
the
two
if
we
had
taken
them
to
fraylingay
it
would
have
been
in
fear
and
trembling
but
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
take
them
had
we
gone
ourselves
for
they
somehow
found
out
that
you
had
asked
them
and
they
insisted
upon
going
and
threatened
to
burn
down
hamilton
house
in
our
absence
if
we
did
not
take
them
a
feat
which
we
doubt
not
they
would
have
accomplished
had
they
had
a
mind
to
indeed
i
can
not
tell
you
what
these
children
are
imagine
their
last
device
to
extort
concessions
from
their
father
you
know
how
nervous
he
is
well
if
he
will
not
do
all
that
they
require
of
him
they
blow
him
up
literally
and
actually
they
put
little
trains
of
gunpowder
about
in
unexpected
places
with
lucifer
matches
that
go
off
when
they
are
trodden
upon
and
you
can
imagine
the
consequence
i
told
him
what
it
would
be
when
he
would
spoil
them
so
but
it
was
no
use
and
now
they
rule
him
instead
of
him
them
so
that
he
has
to
enter
into
solemn
compacts
with
them
about
not
infringing
what
they
call
their
rights
and
only
fancy
he
is
so
fond
to
foolishness
as
to
be
less
annoyed
by
their
naughtiness
than
pleased
because
when
they
promise
not
to
do
anything
again
injun
as
they
phrase
it
they
keep
their
word
galbraith
calls
them
in
derision
heavenly
twins
but
have
i
told
you
about
galbraith
he
is
the
new
master
of
fountain
towers
and
a
charming
as
well
as
remarkable
man
quite
young
being
in
fact
only
but
already
distinguished
as
a
medical
man
he
became
a
professional
man
of
necessity
having
no
expectation
at
that
time
of
ever
inheriting
property
but
now
that
he
is
comparatively
speaking
a
rich
man
he
continues
to
practice
for
the
love
of
science
and
also
from
philanthropic
motives
he
is
a
fine
looking
young
man
physically
with
a
strong
face
of
most
attractive
plainness
only
redeemed
from
positive
ugliness
in
fact
by
good
gray
eyes
white
teeth
and
an
expression
which
makes
you
trust
him
at
once
after
the
first
five
minutes
conversation
with
him
i
have
heard
people
say
that
they
not
only
could
but
would
positively
have
enjoyed
telling
him
all
the
things
that
ever
they
did
so
great
is
the
confidence
he
inspires
he
and
sir
daniel
adopted
son
sir
daniel
is
galbraith
uncle
were
my
brother
great
friends
at
oxford
where
the
three
of
them
were
known
as
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
because
they
passed
unscathed
through
the
burning
fiery
furnace
of
temptation
to
which
young
men
of
position
at
the
universities
are
exposed
galbraith
is
somewhat
abrupt
in
manner
and
quick
of
temper
but
most
with
my
terrible
children
nevertheless
of
course
they
impose
upon
his
good
nature
and
they
are
always
being
punished
but
that
they
do
not
mind
in
fact
i
heard
angelica
say
once
is
all
in
the
day
work
when
she
had
a
long
imposition
to
do
for
something
outrageous
and
diavolo
called
to
her
over
the
stairs
only
yesterday
for
me
a
minute
in
the
hall
till
i
been
thrashed
for
letting
the
horses
and
dogs
loose
and
then
go
and
snare
pheasants
in
the
far
plantation
they
explained
to
me
once
that
being
found
out
and
punished
added
the
same
zest
to
their
pleasures
that
cayenne
pepper
does
to
their
diet
a
little
too
much
of
it
stings
but
just
the
right
quantity
relieves
the
insipidity
and
adds
to
the
interest
and
then
there
is
the
element
of
uncertainty
which
has
a
charm
of
its
own
they
never
know
whether
they
will
it
hot
or
not
when
they
found
out
they
always
confess
everything
with
a
frankness
which
is
quite
provoking
because
they
so
evidently
enjoy
the
recital
of
their
own
misdeeds
and
they
defend
themselves
by
quoting
various
anecdotes
of
the
naughty
doings
of
children
which
have
been
written
for
our
amusement
and
it
is
in
vain
that
i
explain
to
them
that
parents
who
are
hurt
and
made
anxious
by
their
children
disobedience
can
not
see
anything
to
laugh
at
in
their
pranks
at
least
not
for
a
very
long
time
afterward
they
pondered
this
for
some
time
and
then
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
when
they
were
grown
up
and
no
longer
a
nuisance
to
me
i
should
be
a
jolly
old
lady
because
i
should
have
such
a
lot
of
funny
stories
all
my
own
to
tell
people
but
i
shall
weary
you
with
this
inexhaustible
subject
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
do
for
i
am
terribly
anxious
about
my
young
turks
if
they
are
equal
to
such
enormities
in
the
green
leaf
i
am
always
asking
myself
what
will
they
do
in
the
dry
i
own
that
my
sense
of
humour
is
tickled
sometimes
but
never
enough
to
make
me
forget
the
sense
of
danger
present
and
to
come
which
all
this
keeps
forever
alive
come
and
comfort
me
and
tell
me
how
you
have
made
your
own
children
so
charming
ever
lovingly
yours
adeline
mrs
frayling
wrote
a
full
account
of
evadne
presentation
at
court
to
her
sister
orton
beg
who
was
wandering
about
norway
by
herself
at
the
time
and
concluded
her
description
of
the
dear
child
gown
very
charming
appearance
and
dignified
with
some
remarks
about
her
character
to
the
same
effect
as
those
which
she
had
addressed
to
lady
adeline
it
was
natural
perhaps
that
the
last
conversation
orton
beg
had
had
with
evadne
at
fraylingay
which
was
in
fact
the
first
articulate
outcome
of
evadne
coming
as
it
did
at
the
end
of
a
day
of
pleasurable
interest
and
excitement
should
have
made
no
immediate
impression
upon
her
tired
faculties
but
she
recollected
it
now
and
smiled
as
she
read
her
sister
letter
if
that
is
all
you
know
of
your
daughter
my
dear
elizabeth
was
her
mental
comment
i
fancy
there
will
be
surprises
at
fraylingay
but
in
reply
she
merely
observed
that
she
was
glad
evadne
was
so
satisfactory
she
was
too
wise
a
woman
to
waste
words
on
her
sister
elizabeth
who
in
consequence
of
having
had
them
in
abundance
to
squander
all
her
life
long
had
lost
all
sense
of
their
value
and
would
have
failed
to
appreciate
the
force
which
they
collect
in
the
careful
keeping
of
such
silent
folk
as
orton
beg
frayling
was
not
able
to
accept
lady
adeline
invitation
that
year
chapter
ix
this
was
the
period
when
evadne
looked
out
of
narrow
eyes
at
an
untried
world
inquiringly
and
was
warmed
to
the
heart
by
what
she
saw
of
it
theoretically
people
are
cruel
and
unjust
but
practically
to
an
attractive
young
lady
of
good
social
position
and
just
out
their
manners
are
most
agreeable
and
when
evadne
returned
to
fraylingay
after
her
first
season
in
town
she
thought
less
and
sang
more
a
little
bird
in
the
air
is
singing
of
thyri
the
fair
the
sister
of
svend
the
dane
and
the
song
of
the
garrulous
bird
in
the
streets
of
the
town
is
heard
and
repeated
again
and
again
she
carolled
about
the
house
while
the
dust
collected
upon
her
books
she
took
up
one
old
favourite
after
another
when
she
first
returned
but
her
attention
wandered
from
her
best
beloved
and
all
that
were
solid
came
somehow
to
be
set
aside
and
replaced
the
nourishing
fact
by
inflated
fiction
reason
and
logic
by
rhyme
and
rhythm
and
sense
by
sentimentality
so
far
had
her
strong
simple
earnest
mind
deteriorated
in
the
unwholesome
atmosphere
of
london
drawing
rooms
it
was
only
a
phase
of
course
and
she
could
have
been
set
right
at
once
had
there
been
anybody
there
to
prescribe
a
strengthening
tonic
but
failing
that
she
tried
sweet
stimulants
that
soothed
and
excited
but
did
not
nourish
tales
that
caused
chords
of
pleasurable
emotion
to
vibrate
while
they
fanned
the
higher
faculties
into
inaction
vampire
things
inducing
that
fatal
repose
which
enables
them
to
drain
the
soul
of
its
life
blood
and
compass
its
destruction
but
evadne
escaped
without
permanent
injury
for
fortunately
for
herself
among
much
that
was
far
too
sweet
to
be
wholesome
she
discovered
oliver
wendell
holmes
the
breakfast
table
series
elsie
venner
and
the
guardian
angel
and
was
insensibly
fixed
in
her
rightful
place
and
sustained
by
them
the
sun
streaming
into
her
room
one
morning
at
this
time
awoke
her
early
and
tempted
her
up
and
out
there
was
a
sandy
space
beyond
the
grounds
a
long
level
of
her
father
land
extending
to
the
eastern
cliffs
and
considered
barren
by
him
but
rich
with
a
certain
beauty
of
its
own
the
beauty
of
open
spaces
which
rest
and
relieve
the
mind
and
of
immensity
in
the
shining
beyond
the
cliffs
and
the
arching
vault
of
the
sky
overhead
dipping
down
to
encircle
the
earth
and
of
colour
for
all
moods
from
the
vividest
green
of
grass
and
yellow
of
gorse
to
the
amethyst
ling
and
the
browns
with
which
the
waning
year
tipped
every
bush
and
bramble
things
which
when
properly
appreciated
make
life
worth
living
it
was
in
this
direction
that
evadne
walked
taking
it
without
design
but
drawn
insensibly
as
by
a
magnet
to
the
sea
she
had
thought
herself
early
up
but
the
whole
wild
world
of
the
heath
was
before
her
and
she
began
to
feel
belated
as
she
went
there
was
a
suspicion
of
frost
in
the
air
which
made
it
deliciously
fresh
and
exhilarating
the
early
morning
mists
still
hung
about
but
the
sun
was
brightly
busy
dispelling
them
the
rabbits
were
tripping
hither
and
thither
too
intent
on
their
own
business
to
pay
much
heed
to
evadne
a
bird
sprang
up
from
her
feet
and
soared
out
of
sight
and
she
paused
a
moment
with
upturned
face
dilated
eyes
and
lips
apart
to
watch
him
but
a
glimpse
of
the
gorse
recalled
her
and
she
picked
some
yellow
blooms
with
delicate
finger
tips
and
carried
them
in
her
bare
hand
savouring
the
scent
and
at
the
same
time
looking
and
listening
with
an
involuntary
straining
to
enjoy
the
perception
of
each
separate
delicate
delight
at
once
till
presently
the
enthusiasm
of
nature
called
forth
some
further
faculty
and
she
found
herself
sensible
of
every
tint
and
tone
sight
and
sound
distinguishing
deciphering
but
yet
perceiving
all
together
as
the
trained
ear
of
a
musician
does
the
parts
played
by
every
instrument
in
an
orchestra
and
takes
cognizance
of
the
whole
effect
as
well
at
the
end
of
the
waste
there
was
a
little
church
overlooking
the
sea
she
saw
that
the
door
was
open
as
she
approached
it
and
she
paused
to
look
in
the
early
weekday
service
was
in
progress
a
few
quiet
figures
sat
apart
in
the
pews
the
light
was
subdued
something
was
being
read
aloud
by
a
voice
of
caressing
quality
and
musical
she
did
not
attend
to
the
words
but
the
tone
satisfied
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
peace
of
god
invited
and
she
slipped
into
the
nearest
pew
she
found
a
bible
on
the
seat
beside
her
and
opening
it
haphazard
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
words
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
that
do
business
in
great
waters
these
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
the
lap
of
the
little
waves
on
the
beach
below
was
distinctly
audible
the
bird
calls
and
their
twitterings
intermittent
incessant
persistent
came
close
and
departed
and
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
crushed
in
her
hand
rose
to
remind
her
they
were
there
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
it
was
a
passage
to
be
felt
at
the
moment
with
the
sea
itself
so
near
and
as
she
paused
to
ponder
it
her
mind
attuned
itself
involuntarily
to
the
habit
of
holy
thought
associated
with
the
place
while
the
scents
and
sounds
of
nature
streamed
in
upon
her
forming
now
a
soft
undercurrent
now
a
delicious
accompaniment
which
filled
the
interval
between
what
she
knew
of
this
world
and
all
that
she
dreamt
of
the
next
the
cycle
of
sensation
was
complete
and
in
a
moment
her
whole
being
blossomed
into
gladness
her
intellectual
activity
was
suspended
her
senses
awoke
it
was
the
morning
of
life
with
her
and
she
sank
upon
her
knees
and
lifted
up
her
heart
to
express
the
joy
of
it
in
one
ecstatic
note
o
blessed
lord
lord
of
the
happy
earth
lord
of
the
sun
and
our
senses
he
who
comes
to
us
first
in
love
name
and
bids
us
rejoice
and
be
glad
not
he
who
would
have
us
mourn
chapter
x
after
the
experiences
of
that
early
morning
walk
evadne
did
not
go
to
bed
so
late
she
got
up
early
and
went
to
church
the
agreeable
working
of
her
intellectual
faculties
during
the
early
part
of
her
absorbing
had
kept
her
senses
in
abeyance
but
when
the
discipline
of
all
regular
routine
was
relaxed
they
were
set
free
to
get
the
upper
hand
if
they
would
and
now
they
had
begun
to
have
their
way
a
delicate
dreamy
way
of
a
surety
but
it
was
a
sensuous
way
nevertheless
and
not
at
all
a
spiritual
way
as
her
mother
maintained
it
to
be
because
of
the
sometimes
sense
sometimes
intellect
is
the
first
to
awake
in
us
supposing
we
are
dowered
with
an
intellect
but
pain
which
is
the
perfecting
of
our
nature
must
precede
the
soul
awakening
and
for
evadne
at
that
age
with
her
limited
personal
knowledge
of
life
and
scant
experience
of
every
form
of
human
emotion
which
involves
suffering
such
an
awakening
was
impossible
the
first
feeling
of
a
girl
as
happily
situated
and
physically
strong
as
she
was
is
bound
to
be
pleasurable
and
had
she
been
a
young
man
at
this
time
she
would
not
improbably
have
sought
to
heighten
and
vary
her
sensations
by
adding
greater
quantities
of
alcohol
to
her
daily
diet
she
would
have
grown
coarse
of
skin
by
eating
more
than
she
could
assimilate
she
would
have
smelt
strongly
enough
of
tobacco
as
a
rule
to
try
the
endurance
of
a
barmaid
she
would
have
been
anxious
about
the
fit
of
coats
fastidious
as
to
the
choice
of
ties
quite
impossible
in
the
matter
of
trousers
and
prone
to
regard
her
own
image
in
the
glass
caressingly
she
would
have
considered
that
every
petticoat
held
a
divinity
or
every
woman
had
her
price
according
to
the
direction
in
which
nature
had
limited
her
powers
of
perception
with
a
view
to
the
final
making
of
her
into
a
sentimental
or
a
vicious
fool
when
she
should
have
been
hard
at
work
she
would
have
stayed
in
bed
in
the
morning
flattering
her
imagination
with
visions
of
the
peerless
beauties
who
would
all
adore
her
and
the
proud
place
she
would
conquer
in
the
world
and
she
would
have
gone
in
earnest
had
she
been
a
young
man
but
being
as
she
was
she
got
up
early
and
went
to
church
it
was
the
one
way
she
had
of
expressing
the
silent
joy
of
her
being
and
of
intensifying
it
she
practised
an
extreme
ritual
at
this
time
and
found
in
it
the
most
complete
form
of
expression
for
her
mood
possible
and
in
those
early
morning
walks
when
she
brushed
the
cobwebs
from
the
gorse
and
startled
the
twittering
birds
from
their
morning
meal
in
the
caressing
of
healthy
odours
the
uplifting
of
all
sweet
natural
sounds
the
soothing
of
the
great
the
sense
of
infinity
in
the
level
landscape
of
beauty
in
form
and
colour
of
rest
and
peace
in
the
grateful
shadow
of
the
little
church
on
the
cliff
but
above
all
in
the
release
from
mental
tension
and
the
ease
of
feeling
after
the
strain
of
thought
she
found
the
highest
form
of
pleasure
she
had
tasted
the
most
rarefied
the
most
intense
the
valentine
day
of
her
development
was
approaching
and
her
heart
had
begun
already
to
practise
the
notes
of
the
into
which
she
would
burst
when
it
came
it
is
a
nice
question
that
as
to
where
the
sensuous
ends
and
the
spiritual
begins
the
dovetail
is
so
exact
just
at
the
junction
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
and
it
is
there
that
spirit
and
flesh
grow
one
with
delight
on
occasion
but
the
test
of
the
spiritual
lies
in
its
continuity
pleasures
of
the
senses
pall
upon
repetition
but
pleasures
of
the
soul
continue
and
increase
a
delicate
dish
soon
wearies
the
palate
but
the
power
to
appreciate
a
poem
or
a
picture
grows
greater
the
more
we
study
them
illustrations
as
trite
by
the
way
as
those
of
the
average
divine
in
his
weekly
sermon
but
calculated
to
comfort
to
the
same
extent
in
that
they
possess
the
charm
of
familiarity
which
satisfies
by
proving
that
we
know
quite
as
much
of
some
subjects
as
those
who
profess
to
teach
them
still
a
happy
condition
of
the
senses
may
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
great
outpouring
of
spiritual
enthusiasm
and
many
an
inspiring
soul
unconsciously
stimulates
them
in
ways
less
pardonable
perhaps
than
the
legitimate
joy
of
a
good
dinner
to
a
hungry
man
or
the
more
subtle
pleasure
which
a
refined
woman
experiences
while
sharing
the
communion
of
saints
on
a
cushioned
seat
listening
to
exquisite
music
in
a
fashionable
church
sensations
of
gladness
send
some
people
to
church
whom
grief
of
any
kind
would
drive
from
thence
effectually
it
is
a
matter
of
temperament
there
are
those
who
are
by
nature
grateful
for
every
good
gift
who
even
bow
their
heads
and
suffer
meekly
if
they
perceive
that
they
will
have
their
reward
but
are
ready
to
rebel
with
rage
against
any
form
of
ineffectual
pain
this
was
likely
to
be
evadne
case
yet
her
mother
had
been
right
about
her
having
a
deeply
religious
disposition
the
vicar
in
charge
of
the
church
on
the
cliff
he
of
the
musical
voice
borthwick
by
name
became
aware
at
once
of
evadne
regular
attendance
he
was
a
young
man
very
earnest
very
devout
worn
thin
with
hard
work
but
happy
in
that
he
had
it
to
do
and
with
that
serene
expression
of
countenance
which
comes
of
the
habit
of
conscientious
endeavour
as
a
matter
of
course
with
such
men
at
the
present
time
he
sought
solace
in
ritual
his
whole
nature
thrilled
to
the
roll
of
the
organ
to
the
notes
of
a
grateful
anthem
to
the
sight
and
scent
of
his
beautiful
flowers
on
the
altar
and
to
the
harmony
of
colour
and
conventional
design
on
the
walls
of
his
little
church
he
spent
his
life
and
his
substance
upon
it
doing
what
he
could
to
beautify
it
himself
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
finding
in
the
act
of
worship
a
refinement
of
pleasure
difficult
of
attainment
but
possible
and
precious
and
while
all
that
sufficed
for
him
he
honestly
entertained
the
idea
of
celibacy
as
a
condition
necessary
for
the
perfect
purification
of
his
own
soul
and
desirable
as
giving
him
a
place
apart
which
would
help
to
maintain
and
strengthen
his
influence
with
his
people
a
layman
may
remain
a
bachelor
without
attracting
attention
but
a
priest
who
abjures
matrimony
insists
that
he
makes
a
sacrifice
and
deserves
credit
for
the
same
he
says
that
the
laws
of
nature
are
the
laws
of
god
yet
arranges
his
own
life
in
direct
opposition
to
the
greatest
of
them
he
can
give
no
unanswerable
reason
for
maintaining
that
the
legitimate
exercise
of
one
set
of
natural
functions
is
less
holy
than
the
exercise
of
the
others
but
that
is
what
he
believes
and
curiously
inconsistent
as
the
conclusion
is
the
rev
henry
borthwick
had
adopted
this
view
emphatically
at
the
outset
of
his
clerical
career
and
had
announced
his
intention
of
adhering
to
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
just
as
the
snow
under
the
cool
and
quiet
stars
at
dusk
might
feel
full
force
in
itself
to
vow
to
the
rising
moon
that
it
will
not
melt
and
find
nevertheless
of
necessity
when
the
sun
appears
that
it
can
not
keep
its
vow
so
did
the
idea
of
celibacy
pass
from
the
mind
of
the
rev
henry
borthwick
when
evadne
began
to
attend
his
morning
services
insensibly
his
first
view
of
the
subject
vanished
altogether
and
was
immediately
replaced
first
by
an
uplifting
vision
of
the
advantages
of
having
a
wife
help
in
the
parish
then
by
a
glimpse
of
the
tender
pleasure
of
a
wife
presence
in
the
house
and
extraordinary
as
it
may
seem
this
final
thought
occurred
to
him
while
the
psalms
were
being
sung
in
church
one
morning
so
uncertain
is
the
direction
of
mind
at
any
time
he
even
had
a
vision
of
the
joy
of
a
wife
kiss
when
the
sweet
red
lips
that
gave
it
were
curved
like
those
of
the
girl
before
him
he
felt
a
great
outpouring
of
spiritual
grace
during
that
service
his
powers
of
devotion
were
intensified
but
the
moment
it
was
over
he
hurried
to
the
vestry
tore
off
his
surplice
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
met
evadne
as
she
left
the
church
and
lingered
long
on
the
cliffs
with
her
in
earnest
conversation
she
was
late
for
breakfast
that
morning
and
her
mother
asked
her
what
had
detained
her
borthwick
was
talking
to
me
about
the
sacraments
of
the
church
mother
she
answered
her
calm
true
eyes
meeting
her
mother
without
confusion
and
about
the
necessity
for
and
the
advantage
of
frequent
communions
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
dear
i
think
i
should
like
it
her
mother
said
no
more
young
borthwick
was
a
cadet
of
good
family
with
expectations
in
the
way
of
money
influence
enough
to
procure
him
a
deanery
at
least
and
with
a
reputation
for
ability
which
with
his
other
advantages
gave
him
as
fair
a
prospect
as
anybody
she
knew
of
a
bishopric
eventually
just
the
thing
for
evadne
she
reflected
so
she
did
not
interfere
this
was
really
a
happy
time
for
evadne
the
young
priest
frequently
met
her
after
the
early
service
and
she
liked
his
devotion
she
liked
his
face
too
and
his
musical
voice
he
was
her
perfection
of
a
priest
and
when
he
did
not
meet
her
she
missed
him
she
did
not
care
for
him
so
much
when
he
called
at
the
house
however
she
associated
him
somehow
with
her
morning
moods
with
religious
discourses
and
the
church
service
but
when
he
ventured
beyond
these
limits
they
lost
touch
and
so
she
held
him
down
to
them
rigorously
he
tried
to
resist
he
even
conceived
a
distaste
for
ecclesiastical
subjects
and
endeavoured
to
float
her
attention
from
these
on
little
boats
of
fancy
phrases
made
out
of
the
first
freshness
of
new
days
the
beauty
of
the
sun
on
the
sea
the
of
grass
on
the
cliffs
the
pleasure
he
took
in
the
songs
of
birds
and
other
more
mundane
matters
but
he
lost
her
sympathetic
interest
when
he
did
so
receiving
her
polite
attention
instead
which
was
cold
in
comparison
and
therefore
did
not
satisfy
him
so
he
determined
to
try
and
come
to
a
perfect
understanding
and
during
one
of
their
morning
walks
he
startled
her
by
making
her
a
solemn
and
abrupt
offer
of
marriage
she
considered
the
proposition
in
silence
for
some
time
then
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
had
never
seen
him
before
then
she
said
not
knowing
she
was
cruel
and
only
desiring
to
be
frank
i
have
never
thought
of
you
as
a
man
you
know
only
as
a
priest
and
in
that
character
i
think
you
perfect
i
respect
and
reverence
you
i
even
love
you
but
but
what
he
asked
eagerly
his
delicate
face
flushing
his
whole
being
held
in
suspense
but
i
could
not
marry
a
priest
it
would
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
sacrilege
she
was
very
pale
when
she
went
in
that
morning
and
her
mother
noticed
it
and
questioned
her
borthwick
asked
me
to
marry
him
mother
she
answered
straight
to
the
point
as
was
her
wont
he
surprised
me
i
am
not
surprised
dear
her
mother
rejoined
smiling
did
you
suppose
he
would
mother
yes
i
was
sure
of
it
oh
i
wish
you
had
warned
me
then
you
have
accepted
him
evadne
no
i
have
always
understood
that
it
is
not
right
for
a
priest
to
marry
and
the
idea
of
marrying
one
repels
me
he
has
lowered
himself
in
my
estimation
by
thinking
of
such
a
thing
i
could
not
think
of
him
as
i
do
of
other
men
i
can
not
dissociate
him
from
his
office
i
expect
him
somehow
to
be
always
about
his
and
pulpit
frayling
face
had
fallen
but
she
only
said
i
wish
you
could
have
felt
otherwise
dear
evadne
went
up
to
her
room
and
stood
leaning
against
the
frame
of
the
open
window
looking
out
over
the
level
landscape
the
poor
priest
had
shown
deep
feeling
and
it
was
the
first
she
had
seen
of
such
suffering
it
pained
her
terribly
she
got
up
early
next
morning
and
went
out
as
usual
but
the
scent
of
the
gorse
was
obtrusive
the
had
lost
their
charm
the
sound
of
the
sea
had
a
new
and
melancholy
note
in
it
and
the
little
church
on
the
cliff
looked
lonely
against
the
sky
she
could
not
go
there
again
to
be
reminded
of
what
she
would
fain
have
forgotten
no
that
phase
was
over
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
complete
and
to
banish
all
recollection
of
it
she
tried
with
a
will
to
revive
the
suspended
animation
of
her
interest
in
her
books
chapter

all

love
in
women
of
a
certain
let
us
not
say
age
but
youth
says
the
professor
an
electrical
current
passing
through
a
coil
of
wire
makes
a
magnet
of
a
bar
of
iron
lying
within
it
but
not
touching
it
so
a
woman
is
turned
into
a
by
a
tingling
current
of
life
running
round
her
i
should
like
to
see
one
of
them
balanced
on
a
pivot
properly
adjusted
and
watch
if
she
did
not
turn
so
as
to
point
north
and
south
as
she
would
if
the
are
like
those
of
the
earth
our
mother
this
passage
indicates
exactly
the
point
at
which
evadne
had
now
arrived
and
where
she
was
pausing
the
attempt
to
return
to
her
books
had
been
far
from
successful
her
eye
would
traverse
page
after
page
without
transferring
a
single
record
to
her
brain
and
she
would
sit
with
one
open
in
her
lap
by
the
hour
together
not
absorbed
in
thought
but
lost
in
feeling
she
was
both
glad
and
sad
at
the
same
time
glad
in
her
youth
and
strength
and
sad
in
the
sense
of
something
wanting
what
was
it
if
she
had
well
she
longed
and
knew
not
wherefore
had
the
world
nothing
she
might
live
to
care
for
no
second
self
to
say
her
evening
prayer
for
the
poor
little
bird
loved
the
old
nest
but
she
had
unconsciously
outgrown
it
and
was
perplexed
to
find
no
ease
or
comfort
in
it
any
more
she
certainly
entertained
the
idea
of
marriage
at
this
time
she
had
acquired
a
sort
of
notion
from
her
friends
that
it
was
good
to
marry
and
her
own
inclinations
seconded
the
suggestion
she
meant
to
marry
when
she
should
find
the
right
man
but
the
difficulty
of
choice
disturbed
her
she
had
still
much
of
the
spirit
which
made
her
at
twelve
see
nothing
but
nonsense
in
the
turn
gentle
hermit
of
the
dale
drivel
and
she
was
quite
prepared
to
decide
with
her
mind
she
never
took
her
heart
into
consideration
or
the
possibility
of
being
overcome
by
a
feeling
which
is
stronger
than
reason
she
made
her
future
husband
a
subject
of
prayer
however
she
prayed
that
he
might
be
an
upright
man
that
he
might
come
to
her
soon
she
even
asked
for
some
sign
by
which
she
should
know
him
this
was
during
the
morning
service
in
church
one
sunday
not
the
little
one
on
the
cliff
which
was
only
a
but
the
parish
church
to
which
the
whole
family
went
regularly
her
thoughts
had
wandered
away
from
the
lesson
that
was
being
read
to
this
subject
of
private
devotion
and
as
she
formulated
the
desire
for
a
sign
for
some
certainty
by
which
she
might
know
the
man
whom
the
dear
lord
intended
to
be
her
husband
she
looked
up
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
she
met
a
glance
that
abashed
her
she
looked
away
but
her
eyes
were
drawn
back
inevitably
and
this
time
the
glance
of
those
other
eyes
enlightened
her
her
heart
bounded
her
face
flushed
this
was
the
sign
she
was
sure
of
it
she
had
felt
nothing
like
it
before
and
although
she
never
raised
her
eyes
again
she
thrilled
through
the
rest
of
the
service
to
the
consciousness
that
there
not
many
yards
away
her
future
husband
sat
and
sighed
for
her
after
the
service
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
claimed
her
acquaintance
and
was
introduced
by
him
to
her
as
major
colquhoun
he
looked
about
and
was
a
big
blond
man
with
a
heavy
moustache
and
a
delicate
skin
that
flushed
easily
his
hair
was
thin
on
the
forehead
in
a
few
more
years
he
would
be
bald
there
frayling
asked
him
to
lunch
and
evadne
sat
beside
him
she
scarcely
spoke
a
word
the
whole
time
or
looked
at
him
but
she
knew
that
he
looked
at
her
and
she
glowed
and
was
glad
the
little
church
on
the
cliff
seemed
a
long
way
off
and
out
in
the
cold
now
she
was
sorry
for
borthwick
she
had
full
faith
in
the
sign
was
not
the
fact
that
major
colquhoun
whom
she
had
never
even
heard
of
in
her
life
before
was
sitting
beside
her
at
that
moment
confirmation
strong
if
any
were
wanting
but
she
asked
no
more
after
lunch
her
father
carried
his
guest
off
to
smoke
and
she
went
up
to
her
own
room
to
be
alone
and
sat
in
the
sun
by
the
open
window
with
her
head
resting
on
the
back
of
her
chair
looking
up
at
the
sky
and
sighed
and
smiled
and
clasped
her
hands
to
her
breast
and
revelled
in
sensations
major
colquhoun
had
been
staying
with
a
neighbouring
county
gentleman
but
she
found
when
she
met
him
again
at
afternoon
tea
that
her
father
had
persuaded
him
to
come
to
fraylingay
for
some
shooting
he
was
to
go
back
that
night
and
return
to
them
the
following
tuesday
evadne
heard
of
the
arrangement
in
silence
and
unsurprised
had
he
gone
and
returned
she
would
have
wondered
but
this
sudden
admission
of
a
stranger
to
the
family
circle
although
unusual
was
not
unprecedented
at
fraylingay
where
after
it
was
certain
that
you
knew
the
right
people
pleasant
manners
were
the
only
passport
necessary
to
secure
a
footing
of
easy
intimacy
and
besides
it
was
inevitable
that
the
sign
might
be
fulfilled
so
evadne
folded
her
hands
as
it
were
and
calmly
awaited
the
course
of
events
not
doubting
for
a
moment
that
she
knew
exactly
what
that
course
was
to
be
she
did
not
actually
much
of
major
colquhoun
in
the
days
that
followed
although
when
he
was
not
out
shooting
he
was
always
beside
her
but
such
timid
glances
as
she
stole
satisfied
her
and
she
heard
her
mother
say
what
a
man
he
was
and
her
father
emphatically
pronounced
him
to
be
a
very
good
fellow
he
was
irish
by
his
side
scotch
by
his
father
but
much
more
irish
than
scotch
by
predilection
and
it
was
his
mother
tongue
he
spoke
exaggerating
the
accent
slightly
to
heighten
the
effect
of
a
tender
speech
or
a
good
story
with
the
latter
he
kept
frayling
well
entertained
and
evadne
he
plied
with
the
former
on
every
possible
occasion
his
visit
was
to
have
been
for
a
few
days
only
but
it
extended
itself
to
some
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
time
evadne
had
accepted
him
the
engagement
had
been
announced
in
the
proper
papers
frayling
was
radiant
congratulations
poured
in
and
everybody
concerned
was
in
a
state
of
pleasurable
excitement
from
morning
till
night
frayling
was
an
affectionate
woman
and
it
was
touching
to
see
her
writing
fluent
letters
of
announcement
to
her
many
friends
the
smiles
on
her
lips
broken
by
ominous
quiverings
now
and
then
and
a
handkerchief
held
crumpled
in
her
left
hand
and
growing
gradually
damper
as
she
proceeded
with
the
happy
tears
that
threatened
her
neat
epistle
with
blots
and
blisters
it
has
been
the
prettiest
idyl
to
us
onlookers
she
wrote
to
lady
adeline
love
at
first
sight
with
both
of
them
and
their
first
glimpse
of
each
other
was
in
church
which
we
all
take
to
be
the
happiest
omen
that
god
blessing
is
upon
them
and
will
sanctify
their
union
evadne
says
little
but
there
is
such
a
delicate
tinge
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
always
and
such
a
happy
light
in
her
eyes
that
i
can
not
help
looking
at
her
george
is
senior
major
and
will
command
the
regiment
in
a
very
short
time
and
his
means
are
quite
ample
enough
for
them
to
begin
upon
there
is
twenty
years
difference
in
their
ages
which
sounds
too
much
theoretically
but
practically
when
you
see
them
together
you
never
think
of
it
he
is
very
handsome
every
inch
a
soldier
and
an
irishman
with
all
an
irishman
brightness
and
wit
and
altogether
the
most
taking
manners
i
tell
evadne
i
am
quite
in
love
with
him
myself
he
is
a
thoroughly
good
churchman
too
which
is
a
great
blessing
never
misses
a
service
and
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
to
see
him
kneeling
beside
evadne
as
rapt
and
intent
as
she
is
he
was
rather
wild
as
a
young
man
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
he
has
been
quite
frank
about
all
that
to
frayling
and
there
is
nothing
now
that
we
can
object
to
in
fact
we
think
he
is
exactly
suited
to
evadne
and
we
are
thoroughly
satisfied
in
every
way
you
can
imagine
that
i
find
it
hard
to
part
with
her
but
i
always
knew
that
it
would
be
the
case
as
soon
as
she
came
out
and
so
was
prepared
in
a
way
still
that
will
not
lessen
the
wrench
when
it
comes
but
of
course
i
must
not
consider
my
own
feelings
when
the
dear
child
happiness
is
in
question
and
i
think
that
long
engagements
are
a
mistake
and
as
there
is
really
no
reason
why
they
should
wait
they
are
to
be
married
at
the
end
of
next
month
which
gives
us
only
six
weeks
to
get
the
trousseau
we
are
going
to
town
at
once
to
see
about
it
and
i
think
that
probably
the
ceremony
will
take
place
there
too
it
would
be
such
a
business
at
fraylingay
with
all
the
tenants
and
everything
and
altogether
one
has
to
consider
expense
but
do
write
at
once
and
promise
me
that
we
may
expect
you
and
and
the
twins
wherever
it
is
in
fact
i
believe
evadne
is
writing
to
theodore
at
this
moment
to
ask
him
to
be
her
page
and
angelica
will
of
course
be
a
bridesmaid
during
the
first
days
of
her
absorbing
passion
evadne
devotion
to
god
was
intensified
sing
to
the
lord
a
new
song
was
forever
upon
her
lips
when
the
question
of
her
engagement
came
to
be
mooted
she
had
had
a
long
talk
with
her
father
following
upon
a
still
longer
talk
which
he
had
with
major
colquhoun
and
you
are
satisfied
with
my
choice
father
she
said
you
consider
george
in
every
respect
a
suitable
husband
for
me
in
all
respects
my
dear
he
answered
heartily
he
is
a
very
fine
manly
fellow
there
was
nothing
in
his
past
life
to
which
i
should
object
she
ventured
timidly
oh
nothing
nothing
he
assured
her
he
has
been
perfectly
straightforward
about
himself
and
i
am
satisfied
that
he
will
make
you
an
excellent
husband
it
was
all
the
assurance
she
required
and
after
she
had
received
it
she
gave
herself
up
to
her
happiness
without
a
doubt
and
unreservedly
the
time
flew
major
colquhoun
leave
expired
and
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
regiment
at
shorncliffe
but
they
wrote
to
each
other
every
day
and
this
constant
communion
was
a
new
source
of
delight
to
evadne
just
before
they
left
fraylingay
she
went
to
see
her
aunt
orton
beg
the
latter
had
sprained
her
ankle
severely
and
would
therefore
not
be
able
to
go
to
evadne
wedding
she
lived
in
morningquest
and
had
a
little
house
in
the
close
there
morningquest
was
only
twenty
miles
from
fraylingay
but
the
trains
were
tiresomely
slow
and
did
not
run
in
connection
so
that
it
took
as
long
to
get
there
as
it
did
to
go
to
london
and
people
might
live
their
lives
in
fraylingay
and
know
nothing
of
morningquest
orton
beg
husband
was
buried
in
the
old
cathedral
city
and
she
lived
there
to
be
near
his
grave
she
could
never
tear
herself
away
from
it
for
long
together
the
light
of
her
life
had
gone
out
when
he
died
and
was
buried
with
him
but
the
light
of
her
love
fed
upon
the
blessed
hope
of
immortality
burnt
brighter
every
day
her
existence
in
the
quiet
close
was
a
very
peaceful
dreamy
one
soothed
by
the
chime
uplifted
by
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
old
cathedral
and
regulated
by
its
service
evadne
found
her
lying
on
a
couch
beside
an
open
window
in
the
drawing
room
which
was
a
long
low
room
running
the
full
width
of
the
house
and
with
a
window
at
either
end
one
looking
up
the
close
to
the
north
the
other
to
the
south
into
a
flower
garden
and
this
was
the
one
near
which
orton
beg
was
lying
i
think
i
should
turn
to
the
cathedral
aunt
olive
evadne
said
i
do
her
aunt
answered
but
not
at
this
time
of
day
i
travel
round
with
the
sun
it
would
fill
my
mind
with
beautiful
thoughts
to
live
here
evadne
said
looking
up
at
the
lonely
spire
reverently
i
have
no
doubt
that
your
mind
is
always
full
of
beautiful
thoughts
her
aunt
rejoined
smiling
but
i
know
what
you
mean
there
are
thoughts
carved
on
those
dumb
gray
stones
which
can
only
come
to
us
from
such
a
source
of
inspiration
the
sincerity
of
the
old
workmen
their
love
and
their
reverence
were
wrought
into
all
they
produced
and
if
only
we
hold
our
own
minds
in
the
right
attitude
we
receive
something
of
their
grace
do
you
remember
that
passage
of
longfellow
ah
from
what
agonies
of
heart
and
brain
what
exultations
trampling
on
despair
what
tenderness
what
tears
what
hate
of
wrong
what
passionate
outcry
of
a
soul
in
pain
uprose
this
poem
of
the
earth
and
air
this
medieval
miracle
sitting
here
alone
sometimes
i
seem
to
feel
it
all
all
the
capacity
for
loving
sacrifice
and
all
the
energy
of
human
passion
which
wrought
itself
into
that
beautiful
offering
of
its
devotion
and
made
it
acceptable
but
tell
me
evadne
are
you
very
happy
i
am
happy
i
think
auntie
but
i
ca
talk
about
it
i
must
keep
the
consciousness
of
it
close
in
my
own
heart
and
guard
it
jealously
lest
i
dissipate
any
atom
of
it
by
attempting
to
describe
it
do
you
think
then
that
love
is
such
a
delicate
thing
that
the
slightest
exposure
will
destroy
it
i
do
know
what
i
think
but
the
feeling
is
so
fresh
now
auntie
i
am
afraid
to
run
the
risk
of
uttering
a
word
or
hearing
one
that
might
tarnish
it
she
strolled
out
into
the
garden
during
the
afternoon
and
sat
on
a
chair
in
the
shade
of
the
old
brick
wall
with
eyes
half
closed
and
a
smile
hovering
about
her
lips
the
wall
was
curtained
with
canaryensis
virginia
creeper
rich
in
autumn
tints
ivy
and
giant
nasturtiums
great
sunflowers
grew
up
against
it
and
a
row
of
single
dahlias
of
every
possible
hue
crowded
up
close
to
the
sunflowers
they
made
a
background
to
the
girl
slender
figure
she
sat
there
a
long
time
happily
absorbed
and
orton
beg
memory
as
she
watched
her
slipped
back
inevitably
to
her
own
love
days
till
tears
came
of
the
inward
supplication
that
evadne
future
might
never
know
the
terrible
blight
which
had
fallen
upon
her
own
life
evadne
walked
through
the
village
on
her
way
back
to
fraylingay
a
young
woman
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
was
standing
at
the
door
of
her
cottage
looking
out
as
she
passed
and
she
stopped
to
speak
to
her
the
child
held
out
his
little
arms
and
kicked
and
crowed
to
be
taken
and
when
his
mother
had
intrusted
him
to
evadne
he
clasped
her
tight
round
the
neck
and
nibbled
her
cheek
with
his
warm
moist
mouth
sending
a
delicious
thrill
through
every
fibre
of
her
body
a
first
foretaste
of
maternity
she
hurried
on
to
hide
her
emotion
but
all
the
way
home
there
was
a
singing
at
her
heart
a
certainty
of
joys
undreamt
of
hitherto
the
tenderest
sweetest
most
womanly
joys
her
own
house
her
own
husband
her
own
children
perhaps
it
all
lay
in
that
her
chapter
xii
the
next
few
weeks
were
decked
with
the
richness
of
autumn
tints
the
glory
of
autumn
skies
but
evadne
was
unaware
of
either
she
had
no
consciousness
of
distinct
days
and
nights
and
indeed
they
were
pretty
well
mingled
after
she
went
to
town
for
she
often
danced
till
daylight
and
slept
till
dusk
and
it
was
all
a
golden
haze
this
time
with
impressions
of
endless
shops
of
silks
satins
and
lovely
laces
of
costly
trinkets
of
little
notes
flying
between
london
and
shorncliffe
and
of
everybody
so
happy
that
it
was
impossible
to
help
sitting
down
and
having
a
good
cry
occasionally
the
whirl
in
which
she
lived
during
this
period
was
entered
upon
without
thought
her
own
inclinations
agreeing
at
the
time
to
every
usage
sanctioned
by
custom
but
in
after
years
she
said
that
those
days
of
dissipation
and
excitement
appeared
to
her
to
be
a
curious
preparation
for
the
solemn
duties
she
was
about
to
enter
upon
evadne
felt
the
time
fly
and
she
felt
also
that
the
days
were
never
ending
it
was
six
weeks
at
first
and
then
all
at
once
as
it
seemed
there
was
only
one
week
and
then
it
was
tomorrow
all
that
last
day
there
was
a
terrible
racket
in
the
house
and
she
was
hardly
left
alone
a
single
moment
and
was
therefore
thankful
when
finally
late
at
night
she
managed
to
escape
to
her
own
room
not
that
she
was
left
long
in
peace
even
then
however
for
two
of
her
bridesmaids
were
staying
in
the
house
and
they
and
her
sisters
stormed
her
chamber
in
their
and
had
a
pillow
fight
to
begin
with
and
then
sat
down
and
cackled
for
an
hour
speculating
as
to
whether
they
should
like
to
be
married
or
not
they
decided
that
they
should
because
of
the
presents
you
know
and
the
position
and
the
delight
of
having
such
a
lot
of
new
gowns
and
being
your
own
mistress
with
your
own
house
and
servants
they
thought
of
everything
in
fact
but
the
inevitable
husband
the
possession
of
whom
certainly
constituted
no
part
of
the
advantages
which
they
expected
to
secure
by
marriage
evadne
sat
silent
and
smiled
at
their
chatter
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
solved
the
problem
and
knows
but
she
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
and
when
they
had
gone
she
got
her
sacred
commonplace
book
and
glanced
through
it
dreamily
then
rousing
herself
a
little
she
went
to
her
writing
table
and
sat
down
and
wrote
this
is
the
close
of
the
happiest
girlhood
that
girl
ever
had
i
can
not
recall
a
single
thing
that
i
would
have
had
otherwise
when
she
had
locked
the
book
away
with
some
other
possessions
in
a
box
that
was
to
be
sent
to
await
her
arrival
at
her
new
home
she
took
up
a
photograph
of
her
lover
and
gazed
at
it
rapturously
for
a
moment
then
pressed
it
to
her
lips
and
breast
and
placed
it
where
her
eyes
might
light
on
it
as
soon
as
she
awoke
she
was
aroused
by
a
kiss
on
her
lips
and
a
warm
tear
on
her
cheek
next
morning
wake
darling
her
mother
said
this
is
your
wedding
day
oh
mother
she
cried
flinging
her
arms
round
her
neck
how
good
of
you
to
come
yourself
i
so
happy
lady
adeline
and
the
heavenly
twins
had
been
at
the
fraylings
since
breakfast
and
nothing
had
happened
lady
adeline
having
seen
the
children
safely
and
beautifully
dressed
for
the
ceremony
angelica
as
a
bridesmaid
diavolo
as
page
left
them
sitting
with
a
between
them
like
model
twins
really
she
said
to
i
think
the
occasion
is
too
interesting
for
them
to
have
anything
else
in
their
heads
but
the
moment
she
left
them
alone
those
same
heads
went
up
and
set
themselves
in
a
listening
attitude
diavolo
said
angelica
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
her
mother
departing
footsteps
had
died
away
diavolo
dashed
the
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
sprang
up
and
followed
angelica
swiftly
but
stealthily
to
the
very
top
of
the
house
when
the
wedding
party
assembled
in
the
drawing
room
the
twins
were
nowhere
to
be
found
went
peering
through
his
eyeglass
into
every
corner
removed
the
glass
and
looked
without
it
then
dusted
it
and
looked
once
more
to
make
sure
while
lady
adeline
grew
rigid
with
nervous
anxiety
the
search
had
to
be
abandoned
however
but
when
the
party
went
down
to
the
carriages
it
was
discovered
to
everybody
great
relief
that
the
children
had
already
modestly
taken
their
seats
in
one
of
them
with
their
backs
to
the
horses
each
was
carefully
covered
with
an
elegant
wrap
and
sitting
bolt
upright
the
picture
of
primness
the
wraps
were
superfluous
and
was
about
to
remonstrate
but
lady
adeline
exclaimed
for
heaven
sake
interfere
it
is
such
a
if
you
irritate
them
goodness
knows
will
happen
but
manlike
he
could
not
let
things
be
where
have
you
been
you
naughty
children
he
demanded
in
his
precisest
way
you
have
really
given
a
great
deal
of
trouble
well
papa
angelica
retorted
hotly
at
the
top
of
her
voice
through
the
carriage
window
for
the
edification
of
the
crowd
you
said
we
were
to
be
good
children
and
not
get
into
everybody
way
and
here
we
have
been
sitting
an
hour
as
good
as
possible
and
quite
out
of
the
way
and
you
are
satisfied
it
quite
unreasonable
is
it
diavolo
papa
get
on
i
believe
finding
fault
with
us
it
just
a
bad
habit
he
got
and
when
we
give
him
no
excuse
he
invents
one
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
the
party
arrived
at
the
church
without
mishap
but
when
the
procession
was
formed
there
was
a
momentary
delay
they
were
waiting
for
the
bride
page
who
descended
with
the
youngest
bridesmaid
from
the
last
carriage
and
the
two
came
into
the
church
demurely
hand
in
hand
what
darlings
are
they
pretty
what
a
sweet
little
boy
with
his
lovely
dark
curls
was
heard
from
all
sides
but
there
was
also
an
audible
titter
lady
adeline
turned
pale
frayling
fan
dropped
evadne
lost
her
countenance
the
twins
had
changed
clothes
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
then
however
so
angelica
obtained
the
coveted
pleasure
of
acting
as
page
to
evadne
and
diavolo
escaped
the
trouble
of
having
to
hold
up
her
train
and
managed
besides
to
have
some
fun
with
a
small
but
amorous
boy
who
was
to
have
been
angelica
pair
and
who
knowing
nothing
of
the
fraud
which
had
been
perpetrated
insisted
on
kissing
the
fair
diavolo
to
that
young
gentleman
lasting
delight
it
was
a
misty
morning
with
only
fitful
glimpses
of
sunshine
frayling
was
not
a
bit
superstitious
nobody
is
but
she
had
been
watching
the
omens
most
people
do
and
she
would
have
been
better
satisfied
had
the
day
been
bright
but
still
she
felt
no
shadow
of
a
foreboding
until
the
twins
appeared
then
however
there
arose
in
her
heart
a
horrified
exclamation
it
is
unnatural
it
will
bring
bad
luck
there
was
no
fun
for
the
heavenly
twins
apart
so
they
decided
to
sit
together
at
the
wedding
breakfast
and
nobody
dared
to
separate
them
lest
worse
should
come
of
it
diavolo
bet
he
would
drink
as
much
champagne
as
major
colquhoun
and
having
secured
a
seat
opposite
to
an
uncorked
bottle
he
proceeded
conscientiously
to
do
his
best
to
win
the
wager
toward
the
end
of
breakfast
however
he
lost
count
and
then
he
lost
his
head
and
showed
signs
of
falling
off
his
chair
you
must
go
to
sleep
under
the
table
now
said
angelica
it
the
proper
thing
to
do
when
you
drunk
going
to
but
i
not
far
enough
gone
yet
my
legs
are
queer
but
my
head
is
steady
get
under
will
you
i
be
down
directly
and
she
cautiously
but
rapidly
dislodged
him
and
landed
him
at
her
feet
everybody
attention
being
occupied
at
the
moment
by
the
gentleman
who
was
gracefully
returning
thanks
for
the
ladies
when
the
speech
was
over
lady
adeline
remembered
the
twins
with
a
start
and
at
once
missed
diavolo
where
is
he
she
asked
anxiously
he
is
just
doing
something
for
me
mamma
angelica
answered
he
was
acting
at
that
moment
as
her
footstool
under
the
table
she
did
not
join
him
there
as
she
had
promised
however
because
when
the
wine
made
her
begin
to
feel
giddy
she
took
no
more
she
said
afterward
she
saw
no
fun
in
feeling
nasty
and
she
thought
a
person
must
be
a
fool
to
think
there
was
and
diavolo
who
was
suffering
badly
at
the
moment
from
headache
and
nausea
the
effect
of
his
potations
agreed
that
was
on
the
evening
of
the
eventful
day
at
their
own
town
house
their
father
and
mother
having
hurried
them
off
there
as
soon
after
diavolo
was
discovered
in
a
helpless
condition
as
they
could
conveniently
make
their
escape
the
twins
had
been
promptly
put
to
bed
in
their
respective
rooms
and
told
to
stay
there
but
of
course
it
did
not
in
the
least
follow
that
they
would
obey
and
locking
them
up
had
not
been
found
to
answer
angelica
did
remain
quiet
however
an
hour
or
so
resting
after
all
the
excitement
of
the
morning
but
she
got
up
eventually
put
on
her
dressing
gown
and
went
to
diavolo
and
it
was
then
they
discussed
the
drink
question
discussion
however
was
never
enough
for
the
twins
they
always
wanted
to
something
so
now
they
went
down
to
the
library
together
erected
an
altar
of
valuable
books
and
arrayed
themselves
in
white
sheets
which
they
tore
from
the
parental
couch
for
the
purpose
considerably
disarranging
the
same
and
the
sheets
they
covered
with
crimson
curtains
taken
down
at
imminent
risk
of
injuring
themselves
from
one
of
the
dining
room
windows
with
the
help
of
a
ladder
abstracted
from
the
area
by
way
of
the
front
door
although
they
in
their
the
time
chosen
for
this
revel
being
when
their
parents
were
in
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
and
all
the
servants
were
having
their
supper
and
safe
out
of
the
way
the
ladder
was
used
to
go
down
to
the
coal
cellar
and
never
of
course
replaced
the
consequence
being
that
the
next
person
who
went
for
coal
fell
in
in
the
dark
and
broke
her
leg
an
accident
which
cost
from
first
to
last
a
considerable
sum
he
being
a
generous
man
and
unwilling
to
let
anyone
suffer
in
pocket
in
his
service
he
thought
the
risks
to
life
and
limb
were
sufficient
without
that
having
completed
these
solemn
preparations
the
twins
swore
a
ghastly
oath
on
the
altar
never
to
touch
drink
again
and
might
they
be
found
out
in
everything
they
did
on
earth
if
they
broke
it
and
never
see
heaven
when
they
died
the
wedding
breakfast
went
off
merrily
enough
and
when
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
left
the
table
and
the
dining
room
door
was
safely
shut
there
was
much
girlish
laughter
in
the
hall
and
an
undignified
scamper
up
the
stairs
also
a
tussle
as
to
who
should
take
the
first
pin
from
the
bride
veil
and
be
married
next
and
much
amusement
when
mrs
elderly
maid
unconsciously
appropriated
it
herself
in
the
way
of
business
evadne
hugged
her
exclaiming
you
dear
old
jenny
you
be
married
next
and
i
be
your
bridesmaid
oh
no
you
wo
cried
one
of
the
girls
you
never
be
a
bridesmaid
again
then
suddenly
there
was
silence
never
again
is
chilling
in
effect
it
is
such
a
very
long
time
as
evadne
was
leaving
the
room
in
her
travelling
dress
she
noticed
some
letters
lying
on
her
dressing
table
which
she
had
forgotten
and
turned
back
to
get
them
they
had
come
by
the
morning
post
but
she
had
not
opened
any
of
them
and
now
she
began
to
put
them
into
her
pocket
one
by
one
to
read
at
her
leisure
glancing
at
the
superscriptions
as
she
did
so
one
was
from
aunt
olive
dear
aunt
olive
how
kind
of
her
two
were
letters
of
congratulation
from
friends
of
the
family
a
fourth
was
from
the
old
housekeeper
at
fraylingay
she
kissed
that
the
fifth
was
in
a
strange
and
peculiar
hand
which
she
did
not
recognize
and
she
opened
it
first
to
see
who
her
correspondent
might
be
the
letter
was
from
the
north
and
had
been
addressed
to
fraylingay
and
she
should
have
received
it
some
days
before
as
she
drew
it
from
its
envelope
she
glanced
at
the
signature
and
at
the
last
few
words
which
were
uppermost
and
seemed
surprised
she
knew
the
writer
by
name
and
reputation
very
well
although
they
had
never
met
and
feeling
sure
that
the
communication
must
be
something
of
importance
she
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
it
at
once
deliberately
from
beginning
to
end
when
she
appeared
among
the
guests
again
she
was
pale
her
lips
were
set
and
she
held
her
head
high
her
mother
said
the
dear
child
was
quite
overwrought
but
she
saw
only
what
she
expected
to
see
through
her
own
eyes
and
other
people
were
differently
impressed
they
thought
evadne
was
cold
and
preoccupied
when
it
came
to
the
parting
and
did
not
seem
to
feel
leaving
her
friends
at
all
she
went
out
after
kissing
her
mother
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
bowed
polite
but
unsmiling
acknowledgments
to
her
friends
and
drove
off
with
major
colquhoun
with
as
little
show
of
emotion
and
much
the
same
air
as
if
she
had
merely
been
going
somewhere
on
business
and
expected
to
return
directly
thank
goodness
all
that
is
over
major
colquhoun
exclaimed
she
looked
at
him
coolly
and
critically
he
was
sitting
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
she
noticed
that
his
hair
was
thin
on
his
forehead
and
there
was
nothing
of
youth
in
his
eyes
i
expect
you
are
tired
he
further
observed
no
i
am
not
tired
thank
you
evadne
answered
then
she
set
her
lips
once
more
leant
back
and
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
at
the
street
all
sloppy
with
mud
and
the
poor
people
seeming
so
miserable
in
the
rain
which
had
been
falling
steadily
for
the
last
hour
poor
weary
creatures
she
thought
we
have
so
much
and
they
so
little
but
she
did
not
speak
again
till
the
carriage
pulled
up
at
the
station
when
she
leant
forward
with
anxious
eyes
and
said
something
confusedly
about
the
crowd
major
colquhoun
thought
she
was
afraid
of
being
stared
at
he
took
out
his
watch
you
will
only
have
to
cross
the
platform
to
the
carriage
he
said
and
the
train
ought
to
be
up
by
this
time
but
if
you
do
mind
being
left
alone
a
moment
i
just
go
myself
and
see
if
it
is
and
where
they
are
going
to
put
us
and
then
i
can
take
you
there
straight
and
you
feel
the
crowd
at
all
he
was
not
gone
many
minutes
but
when
he
returned
the
carriage
was
empty
where
is
mrs
colquhoun
he
said
she
followed
you
sir
the
coachman
answered
touching
his
hat
confound
he
pulled
himself
up
she
be
back
in
a
moment
i
suppose
he
muttered

said
major
colquhoun
engaged

she

to
the

and
he
started
to
see
the
porter
following
him
did
you
notice
a
young
lady
in
a
gray
dress
pass
this
way
he
asked
the
man
as
they
went
with
a
pink
feather
in
sir

way
sir
the
man
rejoined
she
got
into
a
over

and
drove
off

it
was
the
same
young
lady
major
colquhoun
stopped
short
the
compartment
reserved
for
them
was
empty
also
dover

the

said

ordinary

to
major
colquhoun

deliberately

all

this
was
to

as
he
popped

shut

then
the
whistle
shrieked
derisively
the
crank
turned
and
the
next
moment
the
train
slid
out
into
the
mist
major
colquhoun
had
watched
it
off
like
any
ordinary
spectator
and
when
it
had
gone
he
looked
at
the
porter
and
the
porter
looked
at
him
was
your
luggage
in
the
train
sir
the
man
asked
him
yes
but
only
booked
to
dover
major
colquhoun
answered
carelessly
taking
out
a
cigarette
case
and
choosing
a
cigarette
with
exaggerated
precision
when
he
had
lighted
it
he
tipped
the
porter
and
strolled
back
to
the
entrance
on
the
chance
of
finding
the
carriage
still
there
but
it
had
gone
and
he
called
a
hansom
paused
a
moment
with
his
foot
on
the
step
then
finally
directed
the
man
to
drive
to
the
fraylings
swell
bin
sold
commented
the
porter
and
if
i
was
a
swell
i
would
take
on
neither
chapter
xiii
the
fraylings
had
decided
to
postpone
all
further
festivities
till
the
bride
and
bridegroom
return
so
that
the
wedding
guests
had
gone
and
the
house
looked
as
drearily
commonplace
as
any
other
in
the
street
when
the
hansom
pulled
up
a
little
short
of
the
door
for
major
colquhoun
to
alight
the
servant
who
answered
his
ring
made
no
pretense
of
concealing
his
astonishment
when
he
saw
who
it
was
but
major
colquhoun
manner
effectually
checked
any
expression
of
it
he
was
not
the
kind
of
a
man
whom
a
servant
would
ever
have
dared
to
express
any
sympathy
with
however
obviously
things
might
have
gone
wrong
but
there
was
nothing
in
major
colquhoun
appearance
at
that
moment
to
show
that
anything
had
gone
wrong
except
his
return
when
he
should
have
been
off
on
his
wedding
journey
there
was
probably
a
certain
amount
of
assumption
in
his
apparent
indifference
he
had
always
cultivated
an
inscrutable
bearing
as
being
the
thing
in
his
set
so
that
it
was
easy
for
him
now
to
appear
to
be
cooler
and
more
collected
than
he
was
his
attitude
however
was
largely
due
to
a
want
of
proper
healthy
feeling
for
he
was
a
man
with
small
capacity
left
for
any
great
emotion
he
walked
into
the
hall
and
hung
up
his
hat
is
frayling
alone
he
said
yes
sir
with
frayling
and
the
family
upstairs
in
the
drawing
room
the
man
stammered
ask
him
to
see
me
down
here
please
say
a
gentleman
he
stepped
to
a
mirror
as
he
spoke
and
carefully
twisted
the
ends
of
his
blond
moustache
very
good
sir
said
the
servant
major
colquhoun
walked
into
the
library
in
the
same
deliberate
way
and
turned
up
the
gas
frayling
came
hurrying
down
fat
and
fussy
and
puffing
a
little
but
cheerfully
rubicund
upon
the
success
of
the
proceedings
and
apprehending
nothing
untoward
when
he
saw
his
he
opened
his
eyes
stopped
short
turned
pale
and
gasped
is
evadne
here
major
colquhoun
asked
quietly
here
no
what
should
she
be
doing
here
what
has
happened
frayling
exclaimed
aghast
that
is
just
what
i
do
rightly
know
myself
if
she
is
not
here
major
colquhoun
replied
the
quiet
demeanour
he
had
assumed
contrasting
favourably
with
his
fuss
and
fume
why
have
you
left
her
what
are
you
doing
here
explain
frayling
demanded
almost
angrily
major
colquhoun
related
the
little
he
knew
and
frayling
plumped
down
into
a
chair
to
listen
and
bounced
up
again
when
all
was
said
to
speak
let
me
send
for
her
mother
he
began
showing
at
once
where
in
an
emergency
he
felt
that
his
strength
lay
no
though
i
better
go
myself
and
prepare
her
he
added
on
second
thought
we
must
make
a
fuss
with
all
the
servants
about
too
they
would
talk
and
then
he
fussed
off
himself
with
agitation
evident
in
every
step
something
like
a
smile
disturbed
major
colquhoun
calm
countenance
for
a
moment
and
then
he
stood
twisting
the
ends
of
his
fair
moustache
slowly
with
his
left
hand
and
gazing
into
the
fire
which
shone
reflected
in
his
steely
blue
eyes
making
them
glitter
like
pale
sapphires
coldly
while
he
waited
frayling
returned
with
his
wife
almost
immediately
the
latter
had
had
her
handkerchief
in
her
hand
all
day
but
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
now
major
colquhoun
had
to
repeat
his
story
did
you
look
for
her
in
the
waiting
rooms
frayling
asked
no
she
may
be
there
waiting
for
you
at
this
very
moment
it
was
a
practical
suggestion
but
the
porter
said
he
saw
her
get
into
a
hansom
major
colquhoun
objected
he
said
he
saw
a
young
lady
in
gray
get
into
a
hansom
i
understood
you
to
say
frayling
corrected
him
a
young
lady
in
gray
is
not
necessarily
evadne
there
might
be
a
dozen
young
ladies
in
gray
in
such
a
crowd
there
might
yes
frayling
agreed
and
the
proof
that
it
was
not
evadne
is
that
she
is
not
here
her
mother
proceeded
if
she
had
been
seen
getting
into
a
hansom
it
could
only
have
been
to
come
here
a
hansom
might
break
down
on
the
way
said
major
colquhoun
entertaining
the
idea
for
a
moment
that
is
not
impossible
frayling
decided
but
why
should
she
come
here
major
colquhoun
slowly
pursued
looking
hard
at
his
had
she
any
objection
to
marrying
me
was
she
overpersuaded
into
it
oh
frayling
exclaimed
emphatically
how
you
suppose
such
a
thing
we
should
never
have
of
influencing
the
dear
child
in
such
a
matter
if
there
were
ever
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
it
was
one
why
her
first
words
on
awaking
this
morning
were
mother
i
so
happy
and
that
does
sound
like
being
overpersuaded
then
what
in
god
name
is
the
explanation
of
all
this
major
colquhoun
exclaimed
showing
some
natural
emotion
for
the
first
time
that
is
it
said
frayling
energetically
there
must
be
some
explanation
heaven
grant
that
the
dear
child
has
not
been
entrapped
in
some
way
and
carried
off
and
robbed
and
murdered
or
something
frayling
cried
giving
way
to
the
strain
all
at
once
and
wringing
her
hands
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
the
period
of
speculation
was
followed
by
a
momentary
interregnum
of
silence
which
would
in
due
course
be
succeeded
by
a
desire
to
act
to
do
something
if
nothing
happened
in
the
meantime
something
did
happen
however
the
door
bell
rang
violently
they
looked
up
and
listened
the
hall
door
was
opened
footsteps
approached
paused
outside
the
library
and
then
the
butler
entered
and
handed
frayling
a
telegram
on
a
silver
salver
is
there
any
answer
sir
he
asked
frayling
opened
it
with
trembling
hands
and
read
it
no
no
answer
he
said
the
butler
looked
at
them
all
as
if
they
interested
him
and
withdrew
well
cried
frayling
her
patience
exhausted
is
it
from
her
yes
frayling
replied
it
was
handed
in
at
the
general
post
office
at
the
general
post
office
major
colquhoun
ejaculated
what
on
earth
took
her
there
the
hansom
you
know
said
frayling
oh
dear
to
her
husband
read
it
well
i
going
to
if
you
let
me
he
answered
irritably
but
delaying
nevertheless
to
mutter
something
irrelevant
about
tongues
then
he
read
be
anxious
about
me
have
received
information
about
major
character
and
past
life
which
does
not
satisfy
me
at
all
and
am
going
now
to
make
further
inquiries
will
write
information
about
my
character
and
past
life
exclaimed
major
colquhoun
why
what
is
wrong
with
my
character
what
have
i
done
oh
the
child
is
mad
she
must
be
mad
frayling
ejaculated
frayling
fumed
up
and
down
the
room
in
evident
perturbation
he
had
not
a
single
phrase
ready
for
such
an
occasion
nor
the
power
to
form
one
and
was
consequently
compelled
to
employ
quite
simple
language
you
had
better
make
inquiries
at
the
post
office
he
said
to
major
colquhoun
and
try
and
trace
her
you
must
follow
her
and
bring
her
back
at
once
if
possible
not
i
indeed
was
major
colquhoun
most
unexpected
rejoinder
i
shall
not
give
myself
any
trouble
on
her
account
she
may
go
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
say
that
george
frayling
exclaimed
you
love
her
and
she
loves
i
she
does
some
person
has
come
between
you
but
wait
wait
until
you
know
more
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
i
am
it
will
major
colquhoun
compressed
his
lips
and
looked
sullenly
into
the
fire
chapter
xiv
on
the
third
day
after
evadne
wedding
in
the
afternoon
orton
beg
was
sitting
alone
in
her
long
low
drawing
room
by
the
window
which
looked
out
into
the
garden
she
had
found
it
difficult
to
occupy
herself
with
books
and
work
that
day
her
sprained
ankle
had
been
troublesome
during
the
night
and
she
had
risen
late
and
when
her
maid
had
helped
her
to
dress
and
she
had
limped
downstairs
on
her
crutches
and
settled
herself
in
her
long
chair
she
found
herself
disinclined
for
any
further
exertion
and
just
sat
reclining
upon
pale
pink
satin
cushions
her
slender
hands
folded
upon
her
lap
her
large
dark
luminous
eyes
and
delicate
refined
features
all
set
in
a
wistful
sadness
there
was
a
singular
likeness
between
herself
and
evadne
in
some
things
a
vague
haunting
family
likeness
which
continually
obtruded
itself
but
could
not
be
defined
it
had
been
more
distinct
when
evadne
was
a
child
and
would
doubtless
have
grown
greater
had
she
lived
with
her
aunt
but
the
very
different
mental
attitude
which
she
gradually
acquired
had
melted
the
resemblance
as
it
were
so
that
at
nineteen
although
her
slender
figure
and
air
and
carriage
continually
recalled
orton
beg
who
was
then
in
her
year
the
expression
of
her
face
was
so
different
that
they
were
really
less
alike
than
they
had
been
when
evadne
was
four
years
younger
evadne
disposition
it
must
be
remembered
was
essentially
swift
to
act
she
would
as
a
human
being
have
her
periods
of
strong
feeling
but
that
was
merely
a
physical
condition
in
no
way
affecting
her
character
and
the
only
healthy
minded
happy
state
for
her
was
the
one
in
which
thought
instantly
translated
itself
into
action
with
orton
beg
it
was
different
her
spiritual
nature
predominated
her
habits
of
mind
were
dreamy
she
lived
for
the
life
to
come
entirely
and
held
herself
in
constant
communion
with
another
world
she
felt
it
near
her
she
said
she
believed
that
its
inhabitants
visit
the
earth
and
take
cognizance
of
all
we
do
and
suffer
and
she
cherished
the
certainty
of
one
day
assuming
a
wondrous
form
and
entering
upon
a
new
life
as
vivid
and
varied
and
as
real
as
this
but
far
more
perfect
her
friends
were
chiefly
of
her
own
way
of
thinking
but
her
faith
was
so
profound
and
the
charm
of
her
conversation
so
entrancing
that
the
hardest
headed
materialists
were
apt
to
feel
strange
delicious
thrills
in
her
presence
forebodings
of
possibilities
beyond
the
test
of
reason
and
knowledge
and
they
would
return
time
after
time
to
dispute
her
conclusions
and
argue
themselves
out
of
the
impression
she
had
produced
but
only
to
relapse
into
their
former
state
of
blissful
sensation
so
soon
as
they
once
more
found
themselves
within
range
of
her
influence
opinions
are
germs
in
the
moral
atmosphere
which
fasten
themselves
upon
us
if
we
are
predisposed
to
entertain
them
but
some
states
of
feeling
are
a
perfume
which
every
sentient
being
must
perceive
with
emotions
that
vary
from
extreme
repugnance
to
positive
pleasure
through
diverse
intermediate
strata
of
lively
interest
or
mere
passive
perception
and
the
feeling
which
emanated
from
orton
beg
is
one
that
is
especially
contagious
for
in
the
first
place
the
beauty
of
goodness
appeals
pleasurably
to
the
most
depraved
to
be
elevated
above
themselves
for
a
moment
is
a
rare
delight
to
them
and
in
the
second
there
is
a
deeply
implanted
leaning
in
the
heart
of
man
toward
the
something
beyond
everything
the
impalpable
impossible
imperceptible
which
he
can
not
know
and
will
not
credit
but
is
nevertheless
compelled
to
feel
in
some
of
his
moods
or
in
certain
presences
and
having
once
felt
finds
himself
fascinated
by
it
and
so
returns
to
the
subject
for
the
sake
of
the
sensation
in
that
long
low
drawing
room
of
orton
beg
with
the
window
at
either
end
in
view
of
the
gray
old
cathedral
towering
above
the
gnarled
elms
of
the
lower
close
itself
the
scene
of
every
form
of
human
endeavour
every
expression
of
human
passion
in
surroundings
so
heavy
with
memories
of
the
past
and
listening
to
the
quiet
tone
of
conviction
in
which
orton
beg
spoke
with
the
double
charm
of
extreme
polish
and
simplicity
combined
in
that
same
room
even
the
worldliest
had
found
themselves
rise
into
the
ecstasy
of
the
higher
life
spiritually
freed
for
the
moment
and
with
the
desire
to
go
forth
and
do
great
deeds
of
love
orton
beg
had
sat
idle
an
hour
looking
out
of
the
window
her
mind
in
the
mood
for
music
but
bare
of
thought
a
gale
was
blowing
without
the
old
elms
in
the
close
were
tossing
their
stiff
bare
arms
about
the
ground
was
strewed
with
branches
and
leaves
from
the
limes
and
a
watery
wintry
sun
made
the
misery
of
the
muddy
ground
apparent
and
accentuated
the
blight
of
the
flowers
and
torn
untidiness
of
the
creepers
and
all
the
items
which
make
autumn
gardens
so
desolate
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
early
that
year
they
began
on
evadne
wedding
day
with
a
fearful
storm
which
raged
all
over
the
country
and
burst
with
especial
violence
upon
morningquest
and
the
wind
continued
high
and
showed
no
sign
of
abating
it
was
depressing
weather
and
orton
beg
sighed
more
than
once
unconsciously
but
presently
the
cathedral
clock
began
to
strike
and
she
raised
her
head
to
listen
one
two
three
four
the
round
notes
fell
then
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
chime
rolled
out
over
the
city
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
mechanically
orton
beg
repeated
the
phrase
with
each
note
as
it
floated
forth
filling
the
silent
spaces
and
then
she
awoke
with
a
start
to
thought
once
more
and
knew
that
she
had
been
a
long
long
time
alone
she
was
going
to
ring
but
at
that
moment
a
servant
entered
and
announced
and
miss
beale
they
were
the
wife
and
daughter
of
the
bishop
of
morningquest
the
one
a
very
pleasant
attractive
elderly
lady
the
other
a
girl
of
seventeen
like
her
mother
but
with
more
character
in
her
face
ah
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
orton
beg
exclaimed
trying
to
rise
and
what
a
delicious
breath
of
fresh
air
you
have
brought
in
with
you
my
dear
olive
do
move
beale
rejoined
preventing
her
we
have
been
nearly
blown
away
walking
this
short
distance
just
look
at
hair
i
feel
quite
tempest
tossed
said
edith
getting
up
and
going
to
a
glass
before
which
she
removed
her
hat
and
let
down
her
hair
which
was
the
colour
of
burnished
brass
and
fell
to
her
knees
in
one
straight
heavy
coil
without
a
wave
you
remind
me
of
some
saxon
edith
i
have
seen
in
a
picture
said
orton
beg
looking
at
her
admiringly
but
dear
child
her
mother
deprecated
should
you
make
a
dressing
room
of
the
drawing
room
i
know
orton
beg
will
pardon
me
said
edith
rolling
her
hair
up
deftly
and
neatly
as
she
spoke
with
the
air
of
a
privileged
person
quite
at
home
orton
beg
smiled
at
her
affectionately
but
before
she
could
speak
the
door
opened
once
more
and
the
servant
announced
lord
dawne
and
there
entered
a
grave
distinguished
looking
man
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
apparently
with
black
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
at
once
penetrating
and
winning
in
expression
orton
beg
greeted
him
with
pleasure
beale
with
pleasure
also
but
with
more
ceremony
edith
quite
simply
and
naturally
and
then
he
sat
down
he
was
in
riding
dress
with
his
whip
and
hat
in
his
hand
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
i
did
not
know
you
were
at
morne
said
orton
beg
is
claudia
with
you
no
i
have
only
come
for
a
few
days
lord
dawne
replied
i
came
to
see
adeline
specially
but
they
do
return
from
town
till
they
have
all
been
assisting
at
the
marriage
of
a
niece
of
yours
i
hear
and
the
heavenly
twins
have
been
prolonging
the
festivities
on
their
own
account
adeline
wrote
to
me
in
despair
and
i
have
come
to
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
my
sister
he
added
turning
to
beale
with
his
bright
almost
boyish
smile
which
was
like
his
nephew
diavolo
and
made
them
both
irresistible
my
sister
flatters
herself
that
i
have
some
influence
with
the
children
and
as
it
is
quite
certain
that
nobody
else
has
i
am
careful
not
to
dispel
the
illusion
it
is
a
comfort
to
her
but
the
twins
will
not
allow
me
to
deceive
myself
upon
that
head
they
put
me
in
my
place
every
time
i
see
them
the
last
time
we
had
a
serious
talk
together
i
noticed
that
diavolo
was
thinking
deeply
and
hoped
for
a
moment
that
it
was
about
what
i
was
saying
but
that
apparently
had
not
interested
him
at
all
for
i
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
just
to
see
if
i
had
perchance
made
any
impression
and
discovered
that
he
had
had
something
else
in
his
mind
the
whole
time
was
just
wondering
he
answered
you
care
much
about
being
duke
of
morningquest
not
very
much
i
assured
him
i
was
pretty
certain
you
did
he
replied
you
see
do
so
i
was
just
thinking
you
remain
as
you
are
when
grandpapa
dies
and
let
me
walk
into
the
title
then
i
give
angelica
the
hamilton
house
property
and
it
would
be
very
jolly
for
all
of
us
look
here
angelica
broke
in
in
her
energetic
way
you
going
to
be
a
duke
i
wo
be
left
plain
miss
could
be
plain
miss
anything
diavolo
gallantly
assured
her
bowing
in
the
most
courtly
way
but
angelica
said
with
more
force
than
refinement
that
that
was
all
rot
and
then
diavolo
lost
his
temper
and
pulled
her
hair
and
she
got
hold
of
his
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
room
by
his
my
presence
of
course
counted
for
nothing
and
the
next
i
saw
of
them
they
were
on
their
ponies
in
a
secluded
grassy
glade
of
the
forest
tilting
at
each
other
with
long
poles
for
the
dukedom
angelica
says
she
means
to
beat
demosthenes
hollow
i
use
her
own
phraseology
to
give
character
to
the
quotation
that
delivering
orations
with
a
natural
inclination
to
stammering
was
nothing
to
get
over
compared
to
the
disabilities
which
being
a
girl
imposes
upon
her
but
she
means
to
get
over
them
all
by
hook
which
she
explains
as
being
the
proper
development
of
her
muscles
and
physique
generally
and
by
crook
which
she
defines
as
circumventing
the
slave
drivers
of
her
sex
a
task
which
she
seems
to
think
can
easily
be
accomplished
by
finessing
and
what
was
the
last
thing
orton
beg
inquired
smiling
indulgently
oh
that
was
very
simple
lord
dawne
rejoined
diavolo
dressed
in
velvet
was
caught
and
taken
up
by
a
policeman
for
recklessly
driving
a
hansom
in
oxford
street
angelica
being
inside
the
same
disguised
in
something
of
her
mother
i
wonder
it
was
angelica
who
went
inside
orton
beg
exclaimed
well
that
was
what
her
mother
said
lord
dawne
replied
and
both
her
parents
seem
to
think
the
matter
was
not
nearly
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
in
consequence
had
to
pay
a
fine
for
the
furious
driving
and
use
all
his
influence
with
the
press
to
keep
the
thing
out
of
the
papers
but
where
did
the
children
get
the
hansom
beale
begged
to
be
informed
i
regret
to
say
that
they
hailed
it
through
the
dining
room
window
and
plied
the
driver
with
raw
brandy
until
his
venal
nature
gave
in
to
their
earnestly
persuasive
eloquence
and
the
contents
of
their
purses
and
he
consented
to
let
diavolo
try
what
it
was
like
to
sit
up
on
that
high
box
angelica
having
previously
got
inside
and
of
course
the
moment
the
young
scamp
had
the
reins
in
his
hands
he
drove
off
full
tilt
oh
dear
lady
adeline
beale
exclaimed
lord
dawne
smiled
again
and
changed
the
subject
did
you
feel
the
storm
much
here
he
asked
my
trees
have
suffered
a
great
deal
i
am
sorry
to
say
ah
that
reminds
me
beale
began
a
very
strange
and
solemn
thing
happened
on
the
day
of
the
storm
have
you
heard
of
it
olive
no
orton
beg
answered
with
interest
what
was
it
well
you
know
the
dean
brother
has
a
large
family
of
daughters
beale
replied
and
they
had
a
very
charming
governess
miss
winstanley
a
lady
by
birth
and
an
accomplished
person
and
extremely
well
on
the
morning
of
the
storm
she
was
sitting
at
work
with
one
of
her
pupils
in
the
schoolroom
when
another
came
in
from
the
garden
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
she
saw
miss
winstanley
did
you
get
in
and
take
your
things
off
so
quickly
she
said
have
not
been
out
miss
winstanley
answered
i
saw
you
i
ran
past
you
over
by
the
duck
pond
child
you
must
be
mistaken
i
have
been
out
the
governess
answered
smiling
well
that
child
got
out
her
work
and
sat
down
but
she
had
hardly
done
so
when
another
came
in
and
also
exclaimed
miss
winstanley
how
you
get
here
i
saw
you
standing
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
picture
gallery
as
i
ran
past
this
minute
must
have
a
double
said
miss
winstanley
lightly
it
you
the
child
insisted
saw
you
quite
well
flowers
and
all
the
governess
was
wearing
some
scarlet
geranium
know
what
they
say
if
people
are
seen
like
that
where
they
have
never
been
in
the
body
she
said
jokingly
say
it
is
a
sign
that
that
person
is
going
to
die
in
the
afternoon
beale
continued
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
round
involuntarily
and
in
the
momentary
pause
the
rush
of
the
gale
without
sounded
obtrusively
in
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
she
went
out
alone
for
a
walk
and
did
not
return
and
they
became
alarmed
at
last
and
sent
some
men
to
search
for
her
when
the
storm
was
at
its
height
and
they
found
her
lying
across
a
stile
she
had
been
killed
by
the
branch
of
a
tree
falling
on
her
how
do
you
explain
that
orton
beg
said
softly
to
lord
dawne
i
should
not
attempt
to
explain
it
he
answered
rising
must
you
go
yes
i
am
sorry
to
say
claudia
and
ideala
charged
me
with
many
messages
for
you
they
are
together
as
usual
and
well
i
trust
yes
he
answered
and
most
anxious
to
hear
a
better
account
of
your
foot
ah
i
hope
to
be
able
to
walk
soon
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
what
a
charming
man
he
is
beale
remarked
when
he
had
gone
there
is
no
hope
of
his
marrying
i
suppose
she
added
trying
not
to
look
at
her
daughter
oh
no
orton
beg
exclaimed
in
an
almost
horrified
tone
lord
dawne
friends
made
no
secret
of
his
grand
and
chivalrous
devotion
to
the
distinguished
woman
known
to
them
all
as
ideala
every
one
of
them
was
aware
although
he
had
never
let
fall
a
word
on
the
subject
that
he
had
remained
single
on
her
account
every
one
but
ideala
herself
she
never
suspected
it
or
thought
of
love
at
all
in
connection
with
lord
dawne
and
besides
she
was
married
when
her
friends
had
gone
that
day
orton
beg
sat
long
in
the
gathering
dusk
watching
the
newly
lighted
fire
burn
up
and
thinking
she
was
thinking
of
evadne
chiefly
wondering
why
she
had
had
no
news
of
her
why
her
sister
elizabeth
did
not
write
and
tell
her
all
about
the
wedding
and
she
was
just
on
the
verge
of
anxiety
in
that
state
when
various
possibilities
of
trouble
that
might
have
occurred
to
account
for
delays
begin
to
present
themselves
to
the
mind
when
all
at
once
without
hearing
anything
she
became
conscious
of
a
presence
near
her
and
looking
up
she
was
startled
to
see
evadne
herself
my
dear
child
she
gasped
what
has
happened
why
are
you
here
nothing
has
happened
auntie
do
be
alarmed
evadne
answered
i
am
here
because
i
have
been
a
fool
she
spoke
quietly
but
with
concentrated
bitterness
then
sat
down
and
began
to
take
off
her
gloves
with
that
exaggerated
show
of
composure
which
is
a
sign
in
some
people
of
suppressed
emotion
her
face
was
pale
but
her
eyes
were
bright
and
the
pupils
were
dilated
i
have
come
to
claim
your
hospitality
auntie
she
pursued
to
ask
you
for
shelter
from
the
world
for
a
few
days
i
have
been
a
fool
may
i
stay
surely
dear
child
orton
beg
replied
and
then
she
waited
mastering
the
nervous
tremor
into
which
the
shock
of
evadne
sudden
appearance
had
thrown
her
with
admirable
and
here
again
the
family
likeness
between
aunt
and
niece
was
curiously
apparent
both
masked
their
agitation
because
both
by
temperament
were
shy
and
ashamed
to
show
strong
feeling
evadne
looked
into
the
fire
for
a
little
trying
to
collect
herself
i
knew
what
was
right
she
began
at
last
in
a
low
voice
i
knew
we
should
take
nothing
for
granted
we
should
never
be
content
merely
to
feel
and
suppose
and
hope
for
the
best
in
matters
about
which
we
should
know
exactly
and
yet
i
took
no
trouble
to
ascertain
i
fell
in
love
and
liked
the
sensation
and
gave
myself
up
to
it
unreservedly
certainly
i
was
a
fool
there
is
no
other
word
for
it
but
are
you
married
evadne
orton
beg
asked
in
a
voice
rendered
unnatural
by
the
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
let
me
tell
you
auntie
all
about
it
evadne
answered
hoarsely
she
drew
her
chair
a
little
closer
to
the
fire
and
spread
her
hands
out
to
the
blaze
there
was
no
other
light
in
the
room
by
this
time
the
wind
without
howled
dismally
still
but
at
intervals
as
if
with
an
effort
during
one
of
its
noisiest
bursts
the
cathedral
clock
began
to
strike
and
hushed
it
as
it
were
suddenly
it
seemed
to
be
listening
to
be
waiting
and
evadne
waited
and
listened
too
raising
her
head
there
was
a
perceptible
momentary
pause
then
came
the
chime
full
round
mournful
melodious
yet
glad
too
in
the
strength
of
its
solemn
assurance
filling
the
desolate
regions
of
sorrow
and
silence
with
something
of
hope
whereon
the
weary
mind
might
repose
illustration
musical

lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
when
the
last
reverberation
of
the
last
note
had
melted
out
of
hearing
evadne
sighed
then
she
straightened
herself
as
if
collecting
her
energy
and
began
to
speak
yes
i
am
married
she
said
but
when
i
went
to
change
my
dress
after
the
ceremony
i
found
this
letter
it
was
intended
you
see
to
reach
me
some
days
before
it
did
but
unfortunately
it
was
addressed
to
fraylingay
and
time
was
lost
in
forwarding
it
she
handed
it
to
her
aunt
who
raised
her
eyebrows
when
she
saw
the
writing
as
if
she
recognized
it
hastily
drew
the
letter
from
its
envelope
and
held
it
so
that
the
blaze
fell
upon
it
while
she
read
evadne
knelt
on
the
hearthrug
and
stirred
the
fire
making
it
burn
up
brightly
orton
beg
returned
the
letter
to
the
envelope
when
she
had
read
it
what
did
you
do
she
said
i
read
it
before
i
went
downstairs
and
at
first
i
could
not
think
what
to
do
so
we
drove
off
together
but
on
the
way
to
the
station
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
me
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
go
at
once
and
hear
all
that
there
was
to
tell
and
fortunately
major
colquhoun
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
getting
away
without
any
dispute
he
went
to
see
about
something
leaving
me
in
the
carriage
and
i
just
got
out
walked
round
the
station
took
a
hansom
and
drove
off
to
the
general
post
office
to
telegraph
to
my
people
but
why
did
you
go
home
for
several
reasons
evadne
answered
the
best
being
that
i
never
thought
of
going
home
i
wanted
to
be
alone
and
think
i
fancied
that
at
home
they
either
could
not
or
would
not
tell
me
anything
of
major
colquhoun
past
life
and
i
was
determined
to
know
the
truth
exactly
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
sayings
of
my
father
recurred
to
me
all
at
once
with
a
new
significance
and
made
me
fear
that
there
was
some
difference
between
his
point
of
view
and
mine
on
the
subject
of
a
suitable
husband
he
told
me
himself
that
major
colquhoun
had
been
quite
frank
about
his
past
career
and
then
when
i
came
to
think
it
appeared
to
me
clearly
that
it
was
the
frankness
which
had
satisfied
my
father
the
career
itself
was
nothing
you
heard
how
pleased
they
were
about
my
engagement
yes
orton
beg
answered
slowly
and
i
confess
i
was
a
little
surprised
when
i
heard
from
your
mother
that
your
had
been
in
his
youth
for
i
remembered
some
remarks
you
made
last
year
about
the
kind
of
man
you
would
object
to
marry
and
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
description
that
major
colquhoun
was
very
much
that
kind
of
man
then
why
did
you
warn
me
evadne
exclaimed
i
do
know
whether
i
quite
thought
it
was
a
subject
for
warning
orton
beg
answered
and
at
any
rate
girls
talk
in
that
way
sometimes
not
really
meaning
it
i
thought
it
was
mere
on
our
part
and
theory
and
i
do
know
now
whether
i
quite
approve
of
your
having
been
told
of
this
new
departure
she
added
indicating
the
letter
do
said
evadne
decidedly
i
would
stop
the
imposition
approved
of
custom
connived
at
by
parents
made
possible
by
the
state
of
ignorance
in
which
we
are
carefully
kept
the
imposition
upon
a
innocence
and
inexperience
of
a
disreputable
man
for
a
husband
orton
beg
was
startled
by
this
bold
assertion
which
was
so
unprecedented
in
her
experience
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
utter
a
word
and
when
she
did
speak
she
avoided
a
direct
reply
because
she
thought
any
discussion
on
the
subject
of
marriage
except
from
the
sentimental
point
of
view
was
indelicate
but
tell
me
your
position
exactly
she
begged
what
you
did
next
why
you
are
here
i
went
by
the
night
mail
north
evadne
answered
and
saw
them
they
were
very
kind
they
told
me
everything
i
ca
repeat
the
details
they
disgust
me
no
pray
do
orton
beg
exclaimed
hastily
she
had
no
mind
for
anything
unsavoury
they
had
been
abroad
you
know
evadne
pursued
otherwise
i
should
have
heard
from
them
as
soon
as
the
engagement
was
announced
they
hoped
to
be
in
time
however
they
had
no
idea
the
marriage
would
take
place
so
soon
orton
beg
reflected
for
a
little
and
then
she
asked
in
evident
trepidation
for
she
had
more
than
a
suspicion
of
what
the
reply
would
be
anc
what
are
you
going
to
do
decline
to
live
with
him
evadne
answered
this
was
what
orton
beg
had
begun
to
suspect
but
there
is
often
an
element
of
surprise
in
the
confirmation
of
our
shrewdest
suspicions
and
now
she
sat
upright
leant
forward
and
looked
at
her
niece
aghast
she
demanded
i
shall
decline
to
live
with
him
evadne
repeated
with
emphasis
orton
beg
slowly
resumed
her
reclining
position
acting
as
one
does
who
has
heard
the
worst
and
realizes
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
recover
from
the
shock
i
thought
you
loved
him
she
ventured
after
a
prolonged
pause
yes
so
did
i
evadne
answered
frowning
but
i
was
mistaken
it
was
a
mere
affair
of
the
senses
to
be
put
off
by
the
first
circumstance
calculated
to
cause
a
revulsion
of
feeling
by
lowering
him
in
my
estimation
a
thing
so
slight
that
after
reading
the
letter
as
we
drove
to
the
station
even
so
soon
i
could
see
him
as
he
is
i
noticed
at
once
but
it
was
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
that
although
his
face
is
handsome
the
expression
of
it
is
not
noble
at
all
she
shuddered
as
at
the
sight
of
something
repulsive
you
see
she
explained
my
taste
is
cultivated
to
so
fine
an
extent
i
require
something
extremely
for
the
dish
which
is
to
be
the
de
of
my
my
appetite
is
delicate
it
requires
to
be
tempted
and
a
husband
of
that
kind
a
moral
leper
she
broke
off
with
a
gesture
spreading
her
hands
palms
outward
as
if
she
would
fain
put
some
horrid
idea
far
from
her
besides
marrying
a
man
like
that
allowing
him
an
assured
position
in
society
is
countenancing
vice
and
she
glanced
round
apprehensively
then
added
in
a
fearful
whisper
to
spread
orton
beg
knew
in
her
head
that
reason
and
right
were
on
side
but
she
felt
in
her
heart
the
full
force
of
the
custom
and
prejudice
that
would
be
against
her
and
shrank
appalled
by
the
thought
of
what
the
cruel
struggle
to
come
must
be
if
evadne
persisted
in
her
determination
in
view
of
this
she
sat
up
in
her
chair
once
more
energetically
prepared
to
do
her
best
to
dissuade
her
but
then
again
she
relapsed
giving
in
to
a
doubt
of
her
own
capacity
to
advise
in
such
an
emergency
accompanied
by
a
sudden
and
involuntary
feeling
of
respect
for
evadne
principles
however
peculiar
and
unprecedented
they
might
be
and
for
the
strength
of
character
which
had
enabled
her
so
far
to
act
upon
them
you
must
obey
your
own
conscience
evadne
was
what
she
found
herself
saying
at
last
i
will
help
you
to
do
that
i
would
rather
not
influence
you
you
may
be
right
i
can
not
be
sure
and
yet
i
do
agree
with
you
for
i
know
if
i
could
have
my
husband
back
with
me
i
would
welcome
him
even
if
he
were
a
leper
evadne
compressed
her
lips
in
steady
disapproval
i
should
think
only
of
his
future
i
should
forgive
the
past
that
is
the
mistake
you
good
women
all
make
said
evadne
you
set
a
detestably
bad
example
so
long
as
women
like
you
will
forgive
anything
men
will
do
anything
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
set
up
a
high
standard
of
excellence
for
men
to
reach
in
order
to
have
the
privilege
of
associating
with
you
there
is
this
quality
in
men
that
they
will
have
the
best
of
everything
and
if
the
best
wives
are
only
to
be
obtained
by
being
worthy
of
them
they
will
strive
to
become
so
as
it
is
however
why
should
they
instead
of
punishing
them
for
their
depravity
you
encourage
them
in
it
by
overlooking
it
and
besides
she
added
you
must
know
that
there
is
no
past
in
the
matter
of
vice
the
consequences
become
hereditary
and
continue
from
generation
to
generation
again
orton
beg
felt
herself
checked
where
did
you
hear
all
this
evadne
she
asked
i
never
heard
it
i
read
and
i
thought
she
answered
but
i
am
only
now
beginning
to
understand
she
added
i
suppose
moral
axioms
are
always
the
outcome
of
pained
reflection
knowledge
cries
to
us
in
vain
as
a
rule
before
experience
has
taken
the
sharp
edge
off
our
egotism
by
experience
i
mean
the
addition
of
some
personal
feeling
to
our
knowledge
i
do
understand
you
in
the
least
evadne
orton
beg
replied
your
husband
was
a
good
man
evadne
answered
indirectly
you
have
never
thought
about
what
a
woman
ought
to
do
who
has
married
a
bad
one
in
an
emergency
like
mine
that
is
you
think
i
should
act
as
women
have
been
always
advised
to
act
in
such
cases
that
i
should
sacrifice
myself
to
save
that
one
man
soul
i
take
a
different
view
of
it
i
see
that
the
world
is
not
a
bit
the
better
for
centuries
of
on
the
woman
part
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
time
we
tried
a
more
effectual
plan
and
i
propose
now
to
sacrifice
the
man
instead
of
the
woman
orton
beg
was
silent
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
auntie
evadne
asked
at
last
caressingly
i
do
not
like
to
hear
you
talk
so
evadne
every
word
you
say
seems
to
banish
something
something
from
this
room
something
from
my
life
to
which
i
cling
i
think
it
is
my
faith
in
love
and
loving
you
may
be
right
but
yet
the
consequences
the
struggle
if
we
must
resist
it
is
best
to
submit
it
is
better
not
to
know
it
is
easier
to
submit
yes
it
is
disagreeable
to
know
evadne
translated
there
was
another
pause
then
orton
beg
broke
out
do
make
me
think
about
it
surely
i
have
suffered
enough
disagreeable
to
know
it
is
torture
if
i
ever
let
myself
dwell
on
the
horrible
depravity
that
goes
on
unchecked
the
depravity
which
you
say
we
women
license
by
ignoring
it
when
we
should
face
and
unmask
it
i
should
go
out
of
my
mind
i
do
know
we
all
know
how
can
we
live
and
not
know
but
we
do
think
about
it
we
ca
we
dare
see
i
try
always
to
keep
my
own
mind
in
one
attitude
to
keep
it
filled
for
ever
with
holy
and
beautiful
thoughts
when
i
am
alone
i
listen
for
the
chime
and
when
i
have
repeated
it
to
myself
slowly
he
watching
over
israel
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
my
heart
swells
i
leave
all
that
is
inexplicable
to
him
and
thank
him
for
the
love
and
the
hope
with
which
he
feeds
my
heart
and
keeps
it
from
hardening
i
thank
him
too
she
went
on
hoarsely
for
the
terrible
moments
when
i
feel
my
loss
afresh
those
early
morning
moments
when
the
bright
sunshine
and
the
beauty
of
all
things
only
make
my
own
barren
life
look
all
the
more
bare
in
its
loneliness
when
my
soul
struggles
to
free
itself
from
the
shackles
of
the
flesh
that
it
may
spread
its
wings
to
meet
that
other
soul
which
made
earth
heaven
for
me
here
and
will
i
know
make
all
eternity
ecstatic
as
a
dream
for
me
hereafter
it
is
good
to
suffer
yes
but
surely
i
suffer
enough
my
husband
if
i
cry
to
him
he
will
not
hear
me
if
i
go
down
on
my
knees
beside
his
grave
and
dig
my
arms
in
deep
deep
i
shall
not
reach
him
i
can
not
raise
him
up
again
to
caress
him
or
move
the
cruel
weight
of
earth
from
off
his
breast
the
voice
that
was
always
kind
will
gladden
me
no
more
the
arms
that
were
so
willing
to
protect
the
world
just
think
how
big
it
is
and
if
i
traverse
it
every
yard
i
shall
not
find
him
he
is
not
anywhere
in
all
this
huge
expanse
ah
god
the
agony
of
yearning
the
ache
the
ache
why
must
i
live
auntie
evadne
cried
i
am
selfish
she
knelt
down
beside
her
and
held
her
hand
i
have
made
you
think
of
your
own
irreparable
loss
compared
with
which
i
know
my
trouble
is
so
small
forgive
me
orton
beg
put
her
arms
round
the

neck
and
kissed

said
i
am
so
weak

ah
you

chapter
xv
the
fraylings
had
sent
their
children
and
the
majority
of
their
servants
back
to
fraylingay
the
day
after
the
wedding
but
had
decided
to
stay
in
london
themselves
with
major
colquhoun
until
evadne
wrote
to
relieve
their
anxiety
which
was
extreme
and
gave
them
some
information
about
her
movements
and
intentions
frayling
spent
most
of
the
interval
in
prancing
up
and
down
he
recollected
all
his
past
grievances
real
and
imaginary
and
recounted
them
and
also
speculated
about
those
that
were
to
come
and
mentioned
the
number
of
things
he
was
always
doing
for
everybody
the
position
he
had
to
keep
up
and
consider
for
the
sake
of
his
family
the
scandal
there
would
be
if
this
story
got
about
and
described
in
one
breath
both
his
determination
to
hush
it
up
and
his
conviction
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
do
so
whenever
the
postman
knocked
he
went
to
the
door
to
look
for
a
letter
and
coming
back
each
time
he
invariably
remarked
that
it
was
disgraceful
simply
disgraceful
and
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
his
life
there
was
blame
and
severity
in
his
attitude
toward
poor
frayling
he
seemed
to
insinuate
that
she
might
and
should
have
done
something
to
prevent
all
this
while
there
was
a
mixture
of
sympathy
deprecation
and
apology
in
his
manner
to
his
combined
with
a
certain
air
of
absolving
himself
from
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
major
colquhoun
own
attitude
was
wholly
enigmatical
he
smoked
cigars
read
novels
and
said
nothing
except
in
answer
to
such
remarks
as
were
specially
addressed
to
him
and
then
he
confined
himself
to
the
shortest
and
simplest
form
of
rejoinder
possible
the
dear
fellow
patience
is
exemplary
frayling
remarked
to
her
husband
as
they
went
to
bed
one
night
he
conceals
his
own
feelings
and
never
utters
a
complaint
humph
grunted
frayling
who
scented
some
reproach
in
this
remark
if
the
dear
fellow
does
not
suffer
from
impatience
and
has
no
feelings
to
conceal
it
is
not
much
marvel
if
he
utters
no
complaint
i
believe
he
does
care
a
rap
and
is
only
thinking
of
how
to
get
out
of
the
whole
business
oh
my
dear
how
frayling
exclaimed
i
am
sure
you
are
quite
mistaken
you
do
understand
him
at
all
frayling
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
snorted
he
despised
feminine
conclusions
too
much
to
reply
to
them
but
not
nearly
enough
to
be
wholly
unmoved
by
them
frayling
spent
the
three
days
in
sitting
still
embroidering
silk
flowers
on
a
satin
ground
and
watering
them
well
with
her
tears
but
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
by
the
first
post
letters
arrived
which
put
an
end
to
their
suspense
one
was
from
orton
beg
and
the
other
from
evadne
herself
frayling
read
them
aloud
at
the
breakfast
table
and
the
three
sat
for
an
hour
in
solemn
conclave
considering
them
orton
beg
had
had
time
to
recover
herself
and
reflect
before
she
wrote
and
the
consequence
was
some
modification
of
her
first
impression
my
dear
elizabeth
evadne
is
here
she
arrived
this
afternoon
on
her
wedding
day
she
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
whose
name
i
am
not
allowed
to
mention
here
but
written
under
the
impression
that
evadne
was
being
kept
in
ignorance
of
major
colquhoun
past
life
and
offering
to
give
her
any
information
that
had
been
withheld
so
that
she
might
not
be
blindly
entrapped
into
marrying
him
under
the
delusion
that
he
was
a
worthy
man
the
letter
arrived
too
late
but
evadne
went
off
nevertheless
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
make
further
inquiries
the
result
of
which
is
great
indignation
on
her
part
for
having
been
allowed
to
marry
a
man
of
such
antecedents
and
a
determination
not
to
live
with
him
she
wishes
to
stay
here
with
me
for
he
present
and
i
am
very
glad
to
have
her
i
give
her
an
asylum
but
i
shall
not
speak
a
word
to
influence
her
decision
in
any
way
if
i
can
help
it
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
her
and
i
perceive
that
her
moral
consciousness
and
mine
are
not
quite
the
same
but
in
the
present
state
of
my
ignorance
i
feel
that
it
would
be
presumption
on
my
part
to
set
my
own
up
as
superior
and
therefore
i
think
it
better
not
to
interfere
in
any
way
you
need
not
be
in
the
least
anxious
about
evadne
she
is
quite
well
has
an
excellent
appetite
and
is
not
at
all
inclined
to
pose
as
a
martyr
i
confess
i
should
have
thought
myself
she
would
have
suffered
more
in
the
first
days
of
her
disillusion
for
she
certainly
was
very
much
in
love
with
major
colquhoun
but
her
principles
are
older
than
her
acquaintance
with
him
and
ingrained
principle
is
a
force
superior
to
passion
it
seems
which
is
as
it
should
be
i
am
sorry
for
you
all
and
for
you
especially
dear
in
this
dilemma
for
i
know
how
you
will
feel
it
and
i
am
the
more
sorry
because
i
can
not
say
a
single
word
which
would
relieve
the
state
of
perplexity
you
must
be
in
or
be
in
any
way
a
comfort
to
you
your
loving
sister
olive
orton
beg
evadne
letter
ran
thus
the
close
morningquest
october
my
dear
father
and
mother
aunt
olive
has
kindly
written
to
tell
you
exactly
why
i
am
here
so
that
my
letter
need
only
be
a
supplement
to
hers
for
whatever
trouble
and
anxiety
i
may
have
caused
you
forgive
me
the
thought
of
it
will
be
a
pang
to
me
as
long
as
i
live
since
i
left
you
i
have
been
fully
informed
of
circumstances
in
major
colquhoun
past
career
which
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
live
with
him
as
his
wife
i
find
that
i
consented
to
marry
him
under
a
grave
misapprehension
of
his
true
character
that
he
is
not
at
all
a
proper
person
for
a
young
girl
to
associate
with
and
that
in
point
of
fact
his
mode
of
life
has
very
much
resembled
that
of
one
of
those
heroes
roderick
random
or
tom
jones
specimens
of
humanity
whom
i
hold
in
peculiar
and
especial
detestation
i
consider
i
should
be
wanting
in
all
right
feeling
if
i
held
myself
bound
to
him
by
vows
which
i
took
in
my
ignorance
of
his
history
but
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
some
difficulty
about
the
legal
business
kindly
find
out
for
me
what
will
be
the
best
arrangement
to
make
for
our
separation
and
tell
me
also
if
i
ought
to
write
to
major
colquhoun
myself
i
should
like
it
better
if
my
father
would
relieve
me
of
this
dreadful
necessity
until
we
have
arranged
matters
i
should
prefer
to
stay
here
with
aunt
olive
i
am
very
well
and
happier
too
than
i
should
have
expected
to
be
after
the
shock
of
such
a
disappointment
though
perhaps
less
so
than
i
ought
in
gratitude
to
be
considering
the
merciful
deliverance
i
have
had
from
what
would
have
been
the
shipwreck
of
my
life
your
affectionate
daughter
evadne
good
heavens
good
heavens
frayling
ejaculated
several
times
major
colquhoun
had
curled
his
moustache
during
the
reading
of
the
letter
with
the
peculiar
set
expression
of
countenance
he
was
in
the
habit
of
assuming
to
mask
his
emotions
what
language
what
ideas
frayling
proceeded
i
have
been
much
deceived
in
that
unhappy
child
and
he
shook
his
head
at
his
wife
severely
as
if
it
were
her
fault
major
colquhoun
muttered
something
about
having
been
taken
in
himself
after
the
reading
of
the
letter
frayling
comely
plump
face
looked
drawn
and
haggard
she
could
not
utter
a
word
at
first
and
had
even
exhausted
her
stock
of
tears
all
at
once
however
she
recovered
her
voice
and
gave
sudden
utterance
to
a
determination
i
must
go
to
that
child
she
exclaimed
i
must
i
must
go
at
once
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
her
husband
thundered
he
had
no
reason
in
the
world
for
opposing
the
motherly
impulse
but
it
relieves
the
male
of
certain
species
to
roar
when
he
is
irritated
and
the
relief
is
all
the
greater
when
he
finds
some
sentient
creature
to
roar
at
that
will
shrink
from
the
noise
and
be
awed
by
it
frayling
looked
up
at
him
pathetically
then
riveted
her
eyes
upon
the
tablecloth
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
but
answered
never
a
word
major
colquhoun
with
the
surface
sympathy
of
sensual
men
who
resent
anything
that
produces
a
feeling
of
discomfort
in
themselves
felt
sorry
for
her
and
relieved
the
tension
by
asking
what
was
to
be
said
in
reply
to
evadne
letter
this
led
to
a
discussion
of
the
subject
which
was
summarily
ended
by
frayling
who
deputed
to
his
wife
the
task
of
answering
the
letter
without
allowing
her
any
choice
in
the
matter
it
was
never
his
way
to
do
anything
disagreeable
if
he
could
insist
upon
her
doing
it
for
him
but
frayling
was
nothing
loth
upon
this
occasion
well
she
began
humbly
i
undertake
the
task
since
you
wish
it
but
i
should
have
thought
a
word
from
you
would
have
gone
further
than
anything
i
can
say
however
she
ventured
to
lift
a
hopeful
head
i
have
certainly
always
been
able
to
manage
evadne
she
turned
to
major
colquhoun
i
can
assure
you
george
that
child
has
never
given
me
a
moment
anxiety
in
her
life
and
she
added
in
a
broken
voice
i
never
never
thought
that
she
would
live
to
quote
books
to
her
parents
frayling
found
in
his
own
inclinations
a
reason
for
everything
he
was
very
tired
of
being
shut
up
in
london
and
he
therefore
decided
that
they
should
go
back
to
fraylingay
at
once
and
suggested
that
major
colquhoun
should
follow
them
in
a
few
days
if
evadne
had
not
in
the
meantime
come
to
her
senses
major
colquhoun
agreed
to
this
he
would
have
hidden
himself
anywhere
done
anything
to
keep
his
world
in
ignorance
of
what
had
befallen
him
even
a
man
independence
is
injured
by
excesses
as
the
tissues
waste
the
esteem
of
men
is
fawned
for
instead
of
being
honestly
earned
criticism
is
deprecated
importance
is
attached
to
the
babbling
of
blockheads
and
even
to
the
opinion
of
fools
what
should
have
been
in
major
colquhoun
had
degenerated
into
a
devouring
vanity
which
rendered
him
to
the
slightest
aspersion
he
had
married
evadne
in
order
to
win
the
credit
of
having
secured
an
exceptionally
young
and
attractive
wife
and
now
all
he
thought
of
was
what
fellows
would
say
if
they
knew
of
the
slight
she
had
put
upon
him
to
conceal
this
was
the
one
object
of
his
life
at
present
the
thought
that
forever
absorbed
him
frayling
felt
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
get
away
from
his
if
the
fellow
would
only
speak
he
exclaimed
when
he
was
alone
with
his
wife
what
the
deuce
he
always
thinking
about
i
imagine
he
is
in
great
grief
frayling
maintained
as
soon
as
she
was
settled
at
fraylingay
she
wrote
to
evadne
my
poor
misguided
child
your
whole
action
since
your
marriage
and
your
extraordinary
resolution
have
occasioned
your
dear
father
your
poor
husband
and
myself
the
very
greatest
anxiety
and
pain
we
have
grave
fears
for
your
sanity
i
have
never
in
my
life
heard
of
a
young
lady
acting
in
such
a
way
your
poor
husband
has
been
very
sweet
and
good
all
through
this
dreadful
trial
he
very
much
fears
the
ridicule
which
of
course
would
attach
to
him
if
his
brother
officers
hear
what
has
happened
but
so
far
i
am
thankful
to
say
no
inkling
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
has
leaked
out
the
servants
talk
of
course
but
they
nothing
what
they
suspect
however
is
i
believe
that
you
have
gone
out
of
your
mind
and
i
even
ventured
to
suggest
something
of
the
kind
to
jenny
who
after
all
these
years
is
naturally
concerned
at
the
sight
of
my
deep
distress
i
assure
you
i
have
taken
nothing
since
your
letter
arrived
but
a
little
tea
so
do
dear
child
end
this
distressing
state
of
things
by
returning
to
your
right
state
of
mind
you
are
a
legally
married
woman
and
you
must
obey
the
law
of
the
land
but
of
course
your
husband
would
rather
not
invoke
the
law
and
make
a
public
scandal
if
he
can
help
it
he
does
not
wish
to
force
your
inclinations
in
any
way
and
he
therefore
generously
gives
you
more
time
to
consider
in
fact
he
says
must
come
back
of
her
own
free
will
footnote
what
he
did
say
exactly
was
she
went
of
her
own
accord
and
she
must
come
back
of
her
own
accord
or
not
at
all
just
as
she
likes
shall
not
trouble
about
her
and
he
is
as
ready
i
am
sure
as
your
father
and
myself
are
to
forgive
you
freely
for
all
the
trouble
and
anxiety
you
have
caused
him
and
is
waiting
to
welcome
you
to
his
heart
and
home
with
open
arms
and
evadne
remember
a
woman
has
it
in
her
power
to
change
even
a
reprobate
into
a
worthy
man
and
i
know
from
the
way
george
talks
that
he
is
far
from
being
a
reprobate
now
and
just
think
what
a
work
that
is
the
angels
in
heaven
rejoice
over
the
sinner
that
repents
and
you
have
before
you
a
sphere
of
action
which
it
should
gladden
your
heart
to
contemplate
i
do
deny
that
there
things
in
george
past
life
which
it
is
very
sad
to
think
of
but
women
have
always
much
to
bear
it
is
our
and
you
must
take
up
yours
patiently
and
be
sure
that
you
will
have
your
reward
the
lord
loveth
he
i
wish
now
that
i
had
talked
to
you
on
the
subject
before
you
were
married
and
prepared
you
to
meet
some
forms
of
wickedness
in
a
proper
spirit
you
would
not
then
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
wicked
woman
who
has
caused
all
this
mischief
she
is
some
clever
designing
adventuress
i
suppose
and
she
must
have
told
you
dreadful
things
which
you
should
never
have
heard
of
at
your
age
and
i
suspect
that
jealousy
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
she
may
herself
have
been
cast
off
in
her
wickedness
for
my
own
sweet
innocent
child
sake
when
i
think
of
all
the
happiness
she
has
destroyed
of
these
dark
days
following
such
bright
prospects
i
could
see
her
evadne
i
could
indeed
everything
had
arranged
itself
so
beautifully
he
is
an
excellent
match
the
irish
property
which
he
have
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
and
as
there
is
only
one
fragile
child
between
him
and
the
scotch
estates
you
might
almost
venture
to
calculate
upon
becoming
mistress
of
them
also
and
then
he
certainly
is
a
handsome
and
attractive
man
of
most
charming
manners
so
what
more
do
you
want
he
is
a
good
churchman
too
you
know
how
regularly
he
accompanied
you
to
every
service
and
if
you
will
just
think
for
a
i
am
sure
you
will
see
yourself
that
you
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
and
repent
while
it
is
called
today
but
we
do
not
blame
you
entirely
dear
you
have
surprised
and
distressed
us
but
we
all
freely
forgive
you
and
if
you
will
come
back
at
once
you
need
fear
reproaches
for
not
another
word
will
be
said
on
the
i
am
dear
child
ever
your
loving
mother
elizabeth
frayling
your
father
is
so
horrified
at
your
conduct
that
he
declares
he
will
neither
write
to
you
nor
speak
to
you
until
you
return
to
your
duty
evadne
took
a
day
and
a
half
to
consider
her
mother
letter
and
then
she
wrote
the
following
reply
the
close
morningquest
october
my
dear
mother
i
answer
your
postscript
first
because
i
am
cut
to
the
quick
by
my
father
attitude
i
was
sure
that
and
just
as
i
have
always
thought
him
he
would
allow
that
a
woman
is
entitled
to
her
own
point
of
view
in
a
matter
which
to
begin
with
concerns
her
own
happiness
more
than
anybody
else
and
that
if
she
accepts
a
fallen
angel
for
a
husband
knowing
him
to
be
such
she
shows
a
poor
appreciation
of
her
own
worth
i
am
quite
ready
to
rejoice
over
any
sinner
that
repents
if
i
may
rejoice
as
the
angels
themselves
do
that
is
to
say
at
a
safe
distance
i
would
not
be
a
stumbling
block
in
the
way
of
any
man
reformation
i
only
maintain
that
i
am
not
the
right
person
to
undertake
such
a
task
and
that
if
women
are
to
do
it
at
all
they
should
be
mothers
or
other
experienced
persons
and
not
young
wives
i
am
pained
that
you
should
make
such
a
cruel
insinuation
against
the
character
and
motives
of
the
lady
whom
i
have
to
bless
for
my
escape
from
a
detestable
position
but
even
if
she
had
been
the
kind
of
character
you
describe
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
it
would
have
been
a
triumph
for
me
to
have
obtained
the
reversion
of
her
equally
culpable
associate
that
i
ought
in
fact
to
have
gratefully
accepted
a
secondhand
sort
of
man
you
would
not
counsel
a
son
of
yours
to
marry
a
society
woman
of
the
same
character
as
major
colquhoun
and
neither
more
nor
less
degraded
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
her
would
you
mother
i
know
you
would
not
and
as
a
woman
soul
is
every
bit
as
precious
as
a
man
one
sees
what
cant
this
talk
of
reformation
is
it
seems
to
me
that
such
cases
as
major
colquhoun
are
for
the
clergy
who
have
both
experience
and
authority
and
not
for
young
wives
to
tackle
and
at
any
rate
although
reforming
reprobates
may
be
a
very
noble
calling
i
do
not
at
nineteen
feel
that
i
have
any
vocation
for
it
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
you
mother
with
your
experience
your
known
piety
and
your
sweet
disposition
would
be
a
much
more
suitable
person
to
reform
major
colquhoun
than
i
should
be
his
past
life
seems
to
inspire
you
with
no
horror
the
knowledge
of
it
makes
shrink
from
him
my
husband
must
be
a
man
i
have
very
strong
convictions
you
see
on
the
subject
of
the
sanctity
and
responsibilities
of
marriage
there
are
certain
conditions
which
i
hold
to
be
essential
on
both
sides
i
hold
also
that
human
beings
are
sacred
and
capable
of
deep
desecration
and
that
marriage
their
closest
bond
is
sacred
too
the
holiest
relationship
in
life
and
one
which
should
only
be
entered
upon
with
the
greatest
care
and
in
the
most
reverent
spirit
i
see
no
reason
why
marriage
should
be
a
lottery
but
evidently
major
colquhoun
views
upon
the
subject
differ
widely
from
mine
and
it
seems
to
me
utterly
impossible
that
we
should
ever
be
able
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
each
other
principles
had
i
known
soon
enough
that
he
did
not
answer
to
my
requirements
i
should
have
dismissed
him
at
once
and
thought
no
more
about
him
and
all
this
misery
would
never
have
occurred
but
having
been
kept
in
ignorance
i
consider
that
i
was
inveigled
into
consenting
that
the
vow
i
made
was
taken
under
a
grave
misapprehension
that
therefore
there
is
nothing
either
holy
or
binding
in
it
and
that
every
law
of
morality
absolves
me
from
fulfilling
my
share
of
the
contract
this
of
course
is
merely
considering
marriage
from
the
higher
and
most
moral
point
of
view
but
even
when
i
think
of
it
in
the
lower
and
more
ordinary
way
i
find
the
same
conclusion
forces
itself
upon
me
for
there
certainly
is
no
romance
in
marrying
a
man
old
already
in
every
emotion
between
whom
and
me
the
recollection
of
some
other
woman
would
be
forever
intruding
my
whole
soul
sickens
at
the
possibility
and
i
think
that
it
must
have
been
women
old
in
emotion
themselves
who
first
tolerated
the
staleness
of
such
lovers
i
feel
that
my
letter
is
very
inadequate
mother
the
thought
that
i
am
forced
to
pain
and
oppose
you
distracts
me
but
i
have
tried
conscientiously
to
show
you
exactly
what
my
conviction
and
principles
are
and
i
do
think
i
have
a
right
to
beg
that
you
will
at
least
be
tolerant
however
much
you
may
disagree
with
me
your
affectionate
daughter
evadne
frayling
reply
to
this
letter
arrived
by
return
of
post
red
hot
evadne
glancing
at
the
envelope
frowned
to
find
herself
addressed
as
mrs
colquhoun
the
name
had
not
struck
her
on
her
mother
first
communication
which
was
also
the
first
occasion
upon
which
she
had
been
so
addressed
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
until
now
that
she
would
have
to
be
colquhoun
from
thenceforth
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
she
felt
it
to
be
unjust
distinctly
a
gross
infringement
of
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
she
opened
her
mother
letter
with
rage
and
rebellion
at
her
heart
and
found
the
contents
anything
but
soothing
to
such
a
state
of
mind
it
ran
as
follows
you
most
unnatural
child
we
shall
all
be
disgraced
if
this
story
gets
out
so
far
the
world
knows
nothing
and
there
is
time
for
you
to
save
yourself
i
warn
you
that
your
father
anger
is
extreme
he
says
he
shall
be
obliged
to
put
you
in
a
lunatic
asylum
if
you
do
not
give
in
at
once
and
consent
to
live
with
your
husband
and
there
is
the
law
too
which
your
husband
can
invoke
and
think
of
your
five
sisters
will
anybody
marry
them
after
such
a
business
with
you
their
prospects
will
be
simply
ruined
by
your
heartless
selfishness
no
girl
in
my
young
days
would
have
acted
so
outrageously
it
is
not
decent
it
is
positively
immodest
i
repeat
that
your
father
is
the
proper
person
to
judge
for
you
you
know
nothing
of
the
world
and
even
if
you
did
you
are
not
old
enough
to
think
for
yourself
you
do
not
imagine
yourself
to
be
a
sort
of
seer
i
hope
better
informed
by
intuition
than
your
parents
are
by
wisdom
and
knowledge
for
that
would
be
a
certain
sign
of
insanity
your
father
thinks
your
opposition
is
mere
conceit
and
certainly
no
good
can
come
of
it
all
right
minded
women
have
submitted
and
suffered
patiently
and
have
had
their
reward
think
of
the
mother
of
augustin
her
husband
returned
to
her
penitent
after
years
of
depravity
wise
woman
buildeth
her
house
but
the
foolish
pluck
it
down
and
that
is
what
you
are
doing
continual
dropping
on
a
rainy
day
and
a
contentious
woman
are
alike
for
heaven
sake
my
child
do
not
become
a
contentious
woman
see
also
prov
viii
if
only
you
had
read
your
bible
regularly
every
day
prayed
humbly
for
a
contrite
heart
and
your
as
you
have
always
been
taught
to
do
we
should
never
have
had
all
this
dreadful
trouble
with
you
but
you
show
yourself
wanting
in
respect
in
every
way
and
in
all
right
and
proper
feeling
and
really
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
do
indeed
oh
do
remember
that
forgiveness
is
still
offered
to
you
and
repent
while
it
is
called
i
assure
you
that
your
poor
husband
is
even
more
ready
than
your
father
and
myself
to
forgive
and
forget
i
pray
for
you
continually
evadne
i
do
indeed
if
you
have
any
natural
feeling
at
all
write
and
relieve
my
anxiety
at
once
your
affectionate
mother
elizabeth
frayling
evadne
read
this
letter
in
the
drawing
room
and
stood
for
a
little
leaning
against
the
window
frame
looking
up
at
the
close
at
the
old
trees
dishevelled
by
the
recent
gale
and
at
the
wall
of
the
south
transept
of
the
cathedral
from
which
the
beautiful
spire
sprang
upward
but
she
rendered
no
account
to
herself
of
these
marvels
of
nature
and
art
something
in
her
attitude
as
she
stood
there
with
one
hand
resting
flat
upon
the
window
frame
high
above
her
head
and
the
other
hanging
down
beside
her
loosely
holding
her
mother
letter
attracted
orton
attention
and
made
her
wonder
what
thought
her
niece
was
so
intent
upon
not
one
of
the
thoughts
of
youth
which
are
long
long
thoughts
apparently
for
the
expression
of
her
countenance
was
not
far
away
and
neither
was
it
sad
nor
angry
but
only
intent
presently
she
turned
from
the
window
languidly
strolled
to
the
writing
table
her
letter
and
began
to
write
without
moving
a
muscle
of
her
face
as
she
proceeded
however
she
compressed
her
lips
and
bent
her
brows
portentously
and
orton
beg
was
sure
that
she
heard
no
note
of
the
mellow
chime
which
sounded
once
while
she
was
so
engaged
and
seemed
to
her
aunt
to
plead
with
her
solemnly
to
cast
her
care
on
the
great
power
watching
and
continue
passively
in
the
old
worn
grooves
as
orton
beg
herself
had
done
evadne
began
abruptly
the
close
morningquest
october
dear
mother
you
say
that
no
girl
in
your
young
days
would
have
behaved
so
outrageously
as
i
am
doing
i
wish
you
had
said
decidedly
instead
of
for
i
am
sure
that
any
resistance
to
the
old
iniquitous
state
of
things
is
a
quite
hopeful
sign
of
coming
change
for
the
better
we
are
a
long
way
from
the
days
when
it
was
considered
right
and
becoming
for
women
in
our
position
to
sit
in
their
do
berlin
woolwork
and
say
nothing
we
should
call
that
conniving
now
but
happily
women
are
no
longer
content
to
be
part
of
the
livestock
about
the
place
they
have
acquired
the
right
of
reason
and
judgment
in
matters
concerning
themselves
in
particular
and
the
welfare
of
the
world
at
large
public
opinion
now
is
composed
of
what
think
to
a
very
great
extent
you
remind
me
of
what
other
women
have
done
and
how
patiently
they
have
submitted
i
have
found
the
same
thing
said
over
and
over
again
in
the
course
of
my
reading
but
i
have
not
yet
found
any
particular
mention
made
of
the
great
good
which
would
naturally
have
come
of
all
the
submission
which
has
been
going
on
for
so
many
centuries
if
submission
on
our
part
is
truly
an
effectual
means
of
checking
sin
on
the
contrary
monica
doubtless
made
things
pleasanter
for
her
own
husband
by
rewarding
him
with
forgiveness
a
happy
home
and
good
nursing
when
he
returned
to
her
exhausted
by
vice
but
at
the
same
time
she
set
a
most
pernicious
example
so
long
as
men
believe
that
women
will
forgive
anything
they
will
do
anything
do
you
see
what
i
mean
the
mistake
from
the
beginning
has
been
that
women
have
practised
when
they
should
have
been
teaching
men
you
say
that
i
do
not
know
the
world
but
my
father
does
and
that
therefore
i
must
let
him
judge
for
me
he
probably
does
know
the
world
but
he
quite
evidently
does
not
know
me
our
point
of
view
you
see
is
necessarily
very
different
i
have
no
doubt
that
major
colquhoun
is
agreeable
in
the
temporary
good
fellowship
of
the
smoking
room
and
he
is
agreeable
in
the
drawing
room
also
but
society
and
his
own
interests
require
him
to
be
so
it
is
a
trick
of
manner
merely
which
may
conceal
the
most
objectionable
mind
character
is
what
we
have
most
to
consider
in
the
choosing
of
a
partner
for
life
and
how
are
we
to
consider
it
except
by
actions
such
as
a
man
misdeeds
which
are
specially
the
outcome
of
his
own
individuality
and
are
calculated
in
their
consequences
to
do
more
injury
to
his
family
than
could
be
compensated
for
by
the
most
charming
manners
in
the
world
of
course
i
deprecate
my
father
anger
but
i
must
again
repeat
i
do
not
consider
that
i
deserve
it
the
lunatic
asylum
is
a
nonsensical
threat
and
the
law
i
am
inclined
to
invoke
myself
for
the
purpose
of
ventilating
the
question
do
i
understand
that
major
colquhoun
presumes
to
send
messages
of
forgiveness
what
has
to
forgive
may
i
ask
surely
am
the
person
who
has
been
imposed
upon
do
not
i
beg
allow
him
to
repeat
such
an
impertinence
but
mother
why
do
you
persistently
ignore
my
reason
for
refusing
to
live
with
major
colquhoun
summed
up
it
comes
to
this
really
and
i
give
it
now
vulgarly
baldly
boldly
and
once
for
all
colquhoun
is
not
good
enough
and
i
wo
have
that
is
plain
i
am
sure
and
i
must
beg
you
to
accept
it
as
my
final
decision
the
tone
of
our
correspondence
is
becoming
undignified
on
both
sides
and
the
correspondence
itself
must
end
here
i
shall
not
write
another
word
on
the
subject
and
i
only
wish
you
had
not
compelled
me
to
write
so
much
forgive
me
mother
do
for
being
myself
i
do
know
how
else
to
put
it
but
i
know
that
none
of
the
others
could
do
as
i
have
done
and
yet
i
can
not
help
it
i
can
not
act
otherwise
and
preserve
my
honesty
and
it
is
conscience
and
not
caprice
that
i
am
obeying
i
wish
i
could
make
you
realize
that
but
at
all
events
do
write
me
any
more
hard
words
mother
they
burn
into
my
memory
and
obliterate
the
loving
thoughts
i
have
of
you
it
is
terrible
to
be
met
with
bitterness
and
reproach
where
hitherto
one
has
known
nothing
but
kindness
and
indulgence
so
i
do
entreat
you
mother
once
more
to
forgive
me
for
being
myself
and
above
everything
to
say
nothing
which
will
destroy
my
affection
for
you
believe
me
i
always
have
been
and
hope
always
to
be
your
most
loving
child
evadne
the
last
lines
were
crowded
into
the
smallest
possible
space
and
there
had
hardly
been
room
enough
for
her
name
at
the
end
she
glanced
at
the
clock
as
she
folded
the
letter
and
finding
that
there
was
only
just
time
to
catch
the
post
she
rang
for
a
servant
and
told
her
to
take
it
at
once
then
she
took
her
old
stand
in
the
window
and
watched
the
girl
hurrying
up
the
close
holding
the
white
letter
carelessly
and
waving
it
to
and
fro
on
a
level
with
her
shoulder
as
she
went
i
wish
i
had
had
time
to
it
evadne
thought
shall
i
call
her
back
no
anything
will
be
better
for
mother
than
another
day
suspense
but
i
think
i
might
have
expressed
myself
better
i
do
know
though
she
turned
from
the
window
and
met
her
aunt
kind
eyes
fixed
upon
her
you
are
flushed
evadne
the
latter
said
were
you
writing
home
yes
auntie
evadne
answered
wearily
you
are
looking
more
worried
than
i
have
seen
you
yet
i
worried
auntie
and
i
lost
my
temper
i
could
not
help
it
and
i
am
dissatisfied
i
know
i
have
said
too
much
and
i
have
said
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
and
gone
round
and
round
the
subject
too
and
altogether
i
am
disheartened
i
can
not
imagine
you
saying
too
much
about
anything
evadne
orton
beg
commented
smiling
when
i
am
speaking
you
mean
but
that
is
different
i
am
always
afraid
to
speak
but
i
dare
write
anything
the
subject
is
closed
now
however
i
shall
write
no
more
she
advanced
listlessly
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
close
beside
the
couch
on
which
her
aunt
was
lying
have
you
ever
felt
compelled
to
say
something
which
all
the
time
you
hate
to
say
and
afterward
hate
yourself
for
having
said
that
is
what
i
always
seem
to
be
doing
now
she
looked
up
at
the
cathedral
as
she
spoke
how
i
envy
you
your
power
to
say
exactly
what
you
mean
she
added
who
told
you
i
always
say
exactly
what
i
mean
her
aunt
asked
smiling
well
exactly
what
you
ought
to
say
then
evadne
answered
responding
to
the
smile
orton
beg
sighed
and
resumed
her
knitting
she
was
making
some
sort
of
wrap
out
of
soft
white
wool
and
evadne
noticed
the
glint
of
her
rings
as
she
worked
and
also
the
delicacy
of
her
slender
white
hands
as
she
held
them
up
in
the
somewhat
tiring
attitude
which
her
position
on
the
couch
necessitated
how
patient
you
are
auntie
evadne
said
and
then
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
cheeks
it
is
easy
to
be
patient
when
one
greatest
trial
is
only
the
waiting
for
a
happy
certainty
orton
beg
answered
but
you
will
be
patient
too
evadne
sooner
or
later
you
are
at
the
passionate
age
now
but
the
patient
one
will
come
all
in
good
time
you
have
always
a
word
of
comfort
evadne
said
there
is
one
word
more
i
would
say
although
i
do
not
wish
to
influence
you
orton
beg
began
hesitatingly
you
mean
evadne
answered
and
shook
her
head
no
that
word
is
of
no
use
to
me
mine
is
it
seems
to
me
that
those
who
dare
to
rebel
in
every
age
are
they
who
make
life
possible
for
those
whom
temperament
compels
to
submit
it
is
the
rebels
who
extend
the
boundary
of
right
little
by
little
narrowing
the
confines
of
wrong
and
crowding
it
out
of
existence
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
on
the
ground
with
bent
brows
thinking
deeply
and
then
she
slowly
sauntered
from
the
room
and
presently
passed
the
south
window
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
took
one
turn
round
the
garden
and
then
subsided
into
the
chair
on
which
she
had
sat
and
fed
her
fancy
with
dreams
of
love
a
few
weeks
before
her
marriage
the
day
was
one
of
those
balmy
mild
ones
which
come
occasionally
in
the
sheltered
garden
had
suffered
little
in
the
recent
gale
from
where
orton
beg
reclined
there
was
no
visible
change
in
the
background
of
single
dahlias
sunflowers
and
the
old
brick
wall
curtained
with
creepers
nor
was
there
any
great
difference
apparent
in
the
girl
herself
the
delicate
of
passion
had
faded
to
milky
white
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
her
attitude
somewhat
fatigued
but
that
was
all
a
dance
the
night
before
would
have
left
her
so
exactly
and
orton
beg
watching
her
wondered
at
the
small
effect
of
blighted
affection
as
she
saw
it
in
evadne
compared
with
the
terrible
consequences
which
popular
superstition
attributes
to
a
disappointment
evadne
had
certainly
suffered
but
more
because
her
parents
in
whom
she
had
always
had
perfect
confidence
and
whom
she
had
known
and
loved
as
long
as
she
could
remember
anything
had
failed
her
than
because
she
had
been
obliged
to
cast
a
man
out
of
her
life
who
had
merely
lighted
it
for
a
few
months
with
a
flame
which
she
recognized
now
as
lurid
at
the
best
and
uncertain
and
which
she
would
never
have
desired
to
keep
burning
continually
with
that
feverish
glare
to
the
extinguishing
of
every
other
interesting
object
she
would
have
been
happiest
when
passion
ended
and
love
began
as
it
does
in
happy
marriages
and
she
was
herself
comparing
the
two
states
of
mind
as
she
sat
there
she
was
conscious
of
a
blank
now
dull
and
dispiriting
enough
but
no
more
likely
to
endure
than
the
absorbing
passion
it
succeeded
she
knew
it
for
an
interregnum
and
was
thinking
of
the
books
she
would
send
for
when
she
had
mastered
herself
sufficiently
to
be
interested
in
books
again
it
was
as
if
her
mind
had
been
out
of
health
but
was
convalescent
now
and
recovering
its
strength
and
she
was
as
well
aware
of
the
fact
as
if
she
had
been
suffering
from
some
physical
ailment
which
had
interrupted
her
ordinary
pursuits
and
was
making
plans
for
the
time
when
she
should
be
able
to
resume
them
while
so
engaged
however
she
fell
asleep
as
convalescents
do
and
orton
beg
smiled
at
the
consummation
it
was
not
romantic
but
it
was
eminently
healthy
at
the
same
time
she
heard
the
hall
door
opened
from
without
as
by
one
who
had
a
right
to
enter
familiarly
and
a
man
step
in
the
hall
come
in
she
said
in
answer
to
a
firm
tap
at
the
door
and
smiled
looking
over
her
shoulder
as
it
opened
it
was
galbraith
on
his
way
back
through
morningquest
to
his
own
place
fountain
towers
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
orton
beg
as
he
took
her
hand
i
am
on
my
way
back
from
the
castle
he
rejoined
sitting
down
beside
her
and
i
have
just
come
in
for
a
moment
to
see
how
the
ankle
progresses
quicker
now
i
am
thankful
to
say
she
answered
i
can
get
about
the
house
comfortably
if
i
rest
in
between
times
but
is
there
anything
wrong
at
the
castle
the
same
old
thing
said
galbraith
with
a
twinkle
in
his
bright
gray
eyes
the
duke
has
been
seeing
visions
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
and
lady
fulda
has
been
dreaming
dreams
fatigue
and
fasting
food
and
rest
for
her
she
will
be
undisturbed
by
dreams
and
a
severe
course
of
dieting
for
him
orton
beg
smiled
really
life
is
becoming
too
prosaic
she
said
since
you
dreadfully
clever
people
began
to
discover
a
reason
for
everything
lady
fulda
beauty
and
goodness
would
have
been
enough
to
convince
any
man
at
one
time
that
she
is
a
saint
indeed
and
privileged
to
heal
the
sick
and
converse
with
angels
but
you
are
untouched
by
either
on
the
contrary
he
answered
i
never
see
her
or
think
of
her
without
acknowledging
to
myself
that
she
is
one
of
the
loveliest
and
most
angelic
women
in
the
world
and
she
has
the
true
magnetic
touch
of
a
nurse
too
there
is
healing
in
it
i
have
seen
it
again
and
again
but
that
is
a
natural
process
many
quite
wicked
doctors
are
endowed
in
the
same
way
and
even
more
strongly
than
she
is
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that
he
broke
off
with
a
little
gesture
and
smiled
genially
but
anything
orton
beg
supplemented
anything
supernatural
in
fact
you
ridicule
one
can
not
ridicule
with
which
lady
fulda
name
is
associated
he
answered
but
tell
me
he
exclaimed
catching
sight
of
evadne
placidly
sleeping
in
the
chair
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
held
up
so
as
to
conceal
the
lower
part
of
her
face
are
visions
about
that
one
that
i
see
there
before
me
if
i
were
faust
i
should
love
such
a
marguerite
i
wish
she
would
let
her
hat
drop
i
want
to
see
the
lower
part
of
her
face
the
upper
part
satisfies
me
it
is
fine
the
balance
of
brow
and
frontal
development
are
perfect
orton
beg
coloured
with
a
momentary
annoyance
she
had
forgotten
that
evadne
was
there
but
galbraith
had
entered
so
abruptly
that
there
would
have
been
no
time
to
warn
her
away
in
any
case
no
vision
she
began
or
if
a
vision
one
of
the
nineteenth
century
sort
tangible
and
of
satisfying
continuance
she
is
a
niece
of
mine
and
i
warn
you
in
case
you
have
a
momentary
desire
to
forsake
your
books
and
become
young
in
mind
again
for
her
sake
that
she
is
a
very
long
way
after
marguerite
whom
i
think
she
would
consider
to
have
been
a
very
weak
and
foolish
person
i
can
imagine
her
saying
about
faust
sacrificing
one
self
for
the
transient
pleasure
of
a
moonlight
meeting
or
two
with
a
man
and
a
few
jewels
however
unique
when
one
can
in
italics
and
with
a
note
of
admiration
i
can
put
my
elbow
here
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
my
head
on
my
hand
and
in
a
moment
i
perceive
delights
past
present
and
to
come
of
equal
intensity
more
certain
quality
and
longer
continuance
than
passion
i
perceive
the
gradual
growth
of
knowledge
through
all
the
ages
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
superstition
slowly
parting
breaking
up
and
rolling
away
to
let
the
light
of
science
shine
science
being
truth
and
there
is
all
art
and
all
natural
beauty
from
the
beginning
everything
that
lasts
and
life
why
even
to
think
on
such
subjects
warms
my
whole
being
with
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
which
is
in
itself
a
more
exquisite
pleasure
than
passion
and
not
alloyed
like
the
latter
with
uncertainty
that
terrible
ache
i
might
take
my
walk
in
the
garden
with
my
own
particular
faust
like
any
other
girl
and
as
i
take
my
glass
of
champagne
at
dinner
for
its
pleasurably
stimulating
quality
but
i
hope
i
should
do
both
in
moderation
and
as
to
making
faust
my
all
or
even
giving
him
so
large
a
share
of
my
attention
as
to
limit
my
capacity
for
other
forms
of
enjoyment
absurd
we
are
long
past
the
time
when
there
was
only
one
incident
of
interest
in
a
woman
life
and
that
was
its
love
affair
there
was
no
sense
of
proportion
in
those
days
is
that
how
you
interpret
her
he
said
one
who
holds
herself
well
in
hand
bent
upon
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
life
and
all
the
variety
of
it
perceiving
that
it
is
stupid
to
narrow
it
down
to
the
indulgence
of
one
particular
set
of
emotions
and
determined
not
to
swamp
every
faculty
by
constant
cultivation
of
the
animal
instincts
to
which
all
ages
have
created
altars
best
for
herself
i
suppose
but
hardly
possible
at
present
the
capacity
you
know
is
only
coming
women
have
been
cramped
into
a
small
space
so
long
that
they
can
not
expand
all
at
once
when
they
let
out
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
stretching
and
growing
and
when
they
are
not
on
their
guard
they
will
often
find
themselves
falling
into
the
old
attitude
as
newborn
babes
are
apt
to
resume
the
position
she
will
have
the
perception
the
inclination
but
the
power
unless
she
is
exceptional
the
power
will
only
be
for
her
daughter
daughter
then
she
must
suffer
and
do
no
good
she
must
suffer
yes
but
i
do
know
about
the
rest
she
may
be
a
seventh
wave
you
know
what
is
a
seventh
wave
it
is
a
superstition
of
the
they
say
that
when
the
tide
is
coming
in
it
pauses
always
and
remains
stationary
between
every
seventh
wave
waiting
for
the
next
and
unable
to
rise
any
higher
till
it
comes
to
carry
it
on
and
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
tide
of
human
progress
is
raised
at
intervals
to
higher
levels
at
a
bound
in
some
such
way
the
seventh
waves
of
humanity
are
men
and
women
who
by
the
impulse
of
some
one
action
which
comes
naturally
to
them
but
is
new
to
the
race
gather
strength
to
come
up
to
the
last
halting
place
of
the
tide
and
to
carry
it
on
with
them
ever
so
far
beyond
he
stopped
abruptly
and
brushed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
now
that
i
have
said
that
he
added
it
seems
as
old
as
the
cathedral
there
and
as
familiar
yet
the
moment
before
i
spoke
it
appeared
to
have
only
just
occurred
to
me
if
it
is
an
reminiscence
and
you
come
across
the
original
in
some
book
i
am
afraid
you
will
lose
your
faith
in
me
forever
but
i
pray
you
of
your
charity
make
due
allowance
i
must
go
oh
no
not
yet
a
moment
orton
beg
exclaimed
i
want
to
ask
you
how
are
lady
adeline
and
the
twins
i
have
seen
lady
adeline
for
a
month
he
answered
rising
to
go
as
he
spoke
but
dawne
tells
me
that
the
twins
are
as
awful
as
ever
it
is
a
question
of
education
now
and
it
seems
that
the
twins
have
their
own
ideas
on
the
subject
and
are
teaching
their
parents
but
take
care
of
your
girlie
out
there
he
added
his
strong
face
softening
as
he
took
a
last
look
at
her
her
body
is
not
so
robust
as
her
brain
i
should
say
and
it
is
late
in
the
year
to
be
sitting
out
of
doors
tell
me
galbraith
orton
beg
began
detaining
him
you
are
a
scotchman
you
should
have
the
second
sight
tell
me
the
fate
of
my
girlie
out
there
i
am
anxious
about
her
she
will
marry
he
answered
in
his
deliberate
way
humouring
her
but
not
have
many
children
and
her
husband
name
should
be
george
oh
most
oracular
a
very
oracle
a
delphic
oracle
only
to
be
interpreted
by
the
event
just
so
he
answered
from
the
door
and
then
he
was
gone

in

getting
damp
evadne
roused
herself
and
entered
at
once
by
the
window
i
have
been
hearing
voices
through
my
dim
dreaming
consciousness
she
said
have
you
had
a
visitor
only
the

her
aunt
replied
by
the
way

she
added
what

answered
surprised
why
auntie
nothing
i
wanted
to

chapter
xvi
when
breakfast
was
over
at
fraylingay
next
morning
and
the
young
people
had
left
the
table
frayling
helped
herself
to
another
cup
of
coffee
and
solemnly
opened
evadne
last
letter
the
coffee
was
cold
for
the
poor
lady
had
been
waiting
not
daring
to
take
the
last
cup
herself
because
she
knew
that
the
moment
she
did
so
her
husband
would
want
more
the
emptying
of
the
urn
was
the
signal
which
usually
called
up
his
appetite
for
another
cup
he
might
refuse
several
times
and
even
leave
the
table
amiably
so
long
as
there
was
any
left
but
the
knowledge
or
suspicion
that
there
was
none
set
up
a
sense
of
injury
unmistakably
expressed
in
his
countenance
and
not
to
be
satisfied
by
having
more
made
immediately
although
he
invariably
ordered
it
just
to
mark
his
displeasure
he
would
get
up
and
ring
for
it
emphatically
and
would
even
sit
with
it
before
him
for
some
time
after
it
came
but
would
finally
go
out
without
touching
it
and
be
as
poor
frayling
mentally
expressed
it
oh
dear
quite
upset
for
the
rest
of
the
day
on
this
occasion
however
the
pleasure
of
a
wholly
new
grievance
left
no
space
in
his
fickle
mind
for
the
item
of
irritation
and
he
never
even
noticed
that
the
coffee
was
done
dear
george
sat
beside
frayling
she
kept
him
there
in
order
to
be
able
to
bestow
a
stray
pat
on
his
hand
or
make
him
some
other
sign
of
that
maternal
tenderness
of
which
she
considered
the
poor
dear
fellow
stood
so
much
in
need
frayling
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
reading
a
local
paper
with
one
eye
as
it
were
and
watching
his
wife
for
her
news
with
the
other
a
severely
critical
expression
sat
singularly
ill
upon
his
broad
face
which
was
like
a
baked
apple
puffy
and
wrinkled
and
red
and
there
was
about
him
a
queerly
air
of
settled
opposition
to
everything
which
did
duty
for
both
the
real
and
spurious
object
of
his
attention
frayling
read
the
letter
through
to
herself
and
then
she
put
it
down
on
the
table
and
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
with
a
heavy
sigh
well
what
does
she
say
now
frayling
exclaimed
throwing
down
the
local
paper
and
giving
way
to
his
impatience
openly
dear
george
was
perfectly
cool
she
says
frayling
enjoined
between
two
sniffs
that
major
colquhoun
is
good
enough
and
she
wo
have
him
well
i
understand
that
at
all
events
better
than
anything
else
she
has
said
major
colquhoun
observed
almost
as
if
a
weight
had
been
removed
from
his
mind
and
i
am
quite
inclined
to
come
to
terms
with
her
for
i
do
care
much
myself
for
a
young
lady
who
gets
into
hysterics
about
things
that
other
women
think
nothing
of
oh
say
think
of
george
frayling
deprecated
we
lament
and
deplore
but
we
forgive
and
endure
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
said
major
colquhoun
a
big
dog
which
sat
beside
him
with
its
head
on
his
knee
thumped
his
tail
upon
the
ground
here
and
whined
sympathetically
and
he
laid
one
hand
caressingly
upon
his
head
while
he
twirled
his
big
blond
moustache
with
the
other
he
was
fond
of
children
and
animals
and
all
creatures
that
fawned
upon
him
and
were
not
able
to
argue
if
they
disagreed
with
him
or
resent
it
if
he
kicked
them
actually
or
metaphorically
speaking
not
that
he
was
much
given
to
that
kind
of
thing
he
was
agreeable
naturally
as
all
people
are
only
when
he
did
lose
his
temper
that
was
the
way
he
showed
it
he
would
cut
a
woman
to
the
quick
with
a
word
and
knock
a
man
down
but
both
ebullitions
were
momentary
as
a
rule
it
was
really
too
much
trouble
to
cherish
anger
and
just
then
he
was
thinking
quite
as
much
about
his
moustache
as
about
his
wife
it
had
once
been
the
pride
of
his
life
but
had
come
to
be
the
cause
of
some
misgivings
for
heavy
moustaches
had
gone
out
of
fashion
in
polite
society
frayling
followed
up
the
last
remark
this
is
very
hard
on
you
colquhoun
very
hard
he
declared
pushing
his
plate
away
from
him
and
i
may
say
that
it
is
very
hard
on
me
too
but
it
just
shows
you
what
would
come
of
the
higher
education
of
women
why
they
raise
some
absurd
standard
of
excellence
and
want
to
import
angels
from
eden
if
we
come
up
to
it
major
colquhoun
looked
depressed
yes
mrs
frayling
protested
shaking
her
head
she
says
her
husband
must
be
a
christlike
man
she
says
men
have
agreed
to
accept
christ
as
an
example
of
what
a
man
should
be
and
asserts
that
therefore
they
must
feel
in
themselves
that
they
live
up
to
his
standard
if
they
chose
there
now
mr
frayling
exclaimed
triumphantly
that
is
just
what
i
said
a
christlike
man
indeed
what
absurdity
will
women
want
next
i
do
know
what
to
advise
colquhoun
i
really
do
ca
you
her
frayling
suggested
order
her
how
can
order
her
she
belongs
to
major
colquhoun
now
he
retorted
irritably
but
with
a
fine
conservative
regard
for
the
rights
of
property
and
this
is
the
way
she
keeps
her
vow
of
obedience
major
colquhoun
muttered
oh
but
you
see
the
poor
misguided
child
considers
that
she
made
the
vow
under
a
misapprehension
frayling
explained
her
maternal
instinct
acting
on
the
defensive
when
her
offspring
integrity
was
attacked
and
making
the
position
clear
to
her
do
you
think
dear
to
her
husband
that
if
you
asked
the
bishop
he
would
talk
to
her
the
bishop
frayling
ejaculated
with
infinite
scorn
know
what
women
are
when
they
go
off
like
this
once
they
set
up
opinions
of
their
own
there
talking
to
them
why
have
they
gone
to
the
stake
for
their
opinions
she
would
obey
the
whole
bench
of
bishops
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
and
if
they
condescended
to
talk
to
her
they
would
only
confirm
her
belief
in
her
own
powers
she
would
glory
to
find
herself
opposing
what
she
calls
her
opinions
to
theirs
oh
the
child
is
mad
frayling
wailed
i
said
it
all
along
she
quite
mad
is
there
any
insanity
in
the
family
major
colquhoun
asked
looking
up
suspiciously
none
none
whatever
frayling
hastened
to
assure
him
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
fact
the
women
on
both
sides
have
always
been
celebrated
for
good
sense
and
exceptional
abilities
women
of
course
and
several
of
the
men
have
distinguished
themselves
as
you
know
that
does
not
alter
opinion
in
the
least
mrs
frayling
put
in
evadne
must
be
mad
she
worse
i
think
major
colquhoun
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
deep
disgust
she
worse
than
mad
she
clever
you
can
do
something
with
a
mad
woman
you
can
lock
her
up
but
a
clever
woman
the
devil
and
never
have
thought
it
of
her
he
added
regretfully
such
a
nice
quiet
little
thing
as
she
seemed
with
hardly
a
word
to
say
for
herself
you
would
have
imagined
that
she
knew
what
are
let
alone
having
any
of
her
own
but
that
is
just
the
way
with
women
there
no
being
up
to
them
that
is
true
said
frayling
well
i
do
know
where
she
got
them
frayling
protested
for
i
am
sure
have
any
but
she
seems
to
know
so
much
about
she
declared
glancing
at
the
letter
at
age
i
knew
i
can
vouch
for
that
her
husband
exclaimed
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
oppose
the
education
of
women
might
and
main
and
then
jeer
at
them
for
knowing
nothing
he
was
very
particular
about
the
human
race
when
it
was
likely
to
suffer
by
an
injurious
indulgence
on
the
part
of
women
but
when
it
was
a
question
of
extra
port
wine
for
himself
he
never
considered
the
tortures
of
gout
he
might
be
entailing
upon
his
own
hapless
descendants
however
there
was
an
excuse
for
him
on
this
occasion
for
it
is
not
every
day
that
an
irritated
man
has
an
opportunity
of
railing
at
his
incapacity
and
the
inconvenient
intelligence
of
his
daughter
both
in
one
breath
but
how
has
evadne
obtained
all
this
mischievous
information
i
can
not
think
how
she
could
have
obtained
it
he
ejaculated
knitting
his
brows
at
his
wife
in
a
suspicious
way
as
he
always
did
when
this
importunate
thought
recurred
to
him
in
such
ordinary
everyday
matters
as
the
management
of
his
estate
and
his
other
duties
as
a
county
gentleman
and
also
in
solid
comprehension
of
the
political
situation
of
the
period
he
was
by
no
means
wanting
but
his
mind
simply
circled
round
and
round
this
business
of
evadne
like
a
helpless
swimmer
in
a
whirlpool
able
to
keep
afloat
but
with
nothing
to
take
hold
of
the
risk
of
sending
the
mind
of
an
elderly
gentleman
of
settled
prejudices
spinning
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
at
such
a
rate
is
considerable
during
the
day
he
wandered
up
to
the
rooms
which
had
been
evadne
they
were
kept
very
much
as
she
was
accustomed
to
have
them
but
there
was
that
something
of
bareness
about
them
and
a
kind
of
conveying
a
sense
of
emptiness
and
desertion
which
strikes
cold
to
the
heart
when
it
comes
of
the
absence
of
someone
dear
and
frayling
felt
the
discomfort
of
it
the
afternoon
sunlight
slanted
across
the
little
sitting
room
falling
on
the
backs
of
a
row
of
books
and
showing
the
scars
of
use
and
abuse
on
them
without
deliberate
intention
frayling
followed
the
ray
and
read
the
bald
titles
by
its
uncompromising
clearness
histology
pathology
anatomy
physiology
prophylactics
therapeutics
botany
natural
history
ancient
and
outspoken
history
not
to
mention
the
modern
writers
and
the
various
philosophies
frayling
took
out
a
work
on
sociology
opened
it
read
a
few
passages
which
evadne
had
marked
and
solemnly
ejaculated
good
heavens
several
times
he
could
not
have
been
more
horrified
had
the
books
been
mademoiselle
de
maupin
nana
la
terre
madame
bovary
and
sapho
yet
had
women
been
taught
to
read
the
former
and
reflect
upon
them
our
sacred
humanity
might
have
been
saved
sooner
from
the
depth
of
degradation
depicted
in
the
latter
the
discovery
of
these
books
was
an
adding
of
alkali
to
the
acid
of
frayling
disposition
at
the
moment
and
he
went
down
to
look
for
his
wife
while
he
was
still
effervescing
how
did
evadne
get
them
he
wanted
to
know
frayling
could
not
conceive
she
had
forgotten
all
about
evadne
discovery
of
the
box
of
books
in
the
attic
and
the
sort
of
general
consent
she
had
given
when
evadne
worried
her
for
permission
to
read
them
she
must
be
a
most
deceitful
girl
i
shall
go
and
talk
to
her
myself
frayling
concluded
and
doubtless
if
only
he
had
had
a
pair
of
wings
to
spread
he
would
presently
have
appeared
sailing
over
the
cathedral
into
the
close
at
morningquest
a
portly
bird
in
a
frock
coat
tall
hat
and
a
very
bad
temper
but
poor
gentleman
he
really
was
an
object
for
compassion
all
his
ideas
of
propriety
and
the
natural
social
order
of
the
universe
were
being
outraged
and
by
his
favourite
daughter
too
the
one
whom
everybody
thought
so
like
him
and
in
truth
she
was
like
him
especially
in
the
matter
of
sticking
to
her
own
opinion
just
the
very
thing
he
had
no
patience
with
for
he
detested
obstinate
people
he
said
so
himself
he
did
not
go
however
having
preparations
to
make
and
a
train
to
wait
for
gave
him
time
to
reflect
and
perceiving
that
the
interview
must
inevitably
be
of
a
most
disagreeable
nature
he
decided
to
send
his
wife
next
day
to
reason
with
her
daughter
frayling
came
upon
evadne
unawares
and
the
shock
it
gave
the
girl
to
see
her
mother
all
miserably
agitated
and
worn
with
worry
was
a
more
powerful
point
in
favour
of
the
success
of
the
latter
mission
than
any
argument
would
have
been
the
poor
lady
was
handsomely
dressed
and
of
a
large
presence
calculated
to
inspire
awe
in
inferiors
unaccustomed
to
it
she
was
a
woman
with
even
teeth
thick
brown
hair
scarcely
tinged
with
gray
and
a
beautiful
soft
transparent
pink
and
white
complexion
and
evadne
had
always
seen
her
in
a
state
of
placid
content
never
really
interrupted
except
by
such
surface
squalls
as
were
caused
by
having
to
scold
the
children
or
the
shedding
of
a
few
sunshiny
tears
and
had
thought
her
lovely
but
when
she
entered
now
and
had
given
her
daughter
the
corner
of
her
cheek
to
kiss
for
form
sake
she
sat
down
with
quivering
lips
and
watery
eyes
all
red
with
crying
and
a
aspect
generally
which
cut
the
girl
to
the
quick
oh
mother
evadne
cried
kneeling
down
on
the
floor
beside
her
and
putting
her
arms
about
her
it
grieves
me
deeply
to
see
you
so
distressed
but
frayling
held
herself
stiffly
refusing
to
be
embraced
and
presenting
a
surface
for
the
operation
as
unyielding
as
the
figurehead
of
a
ship
if
you
are
sincere
she
said
severely
you
will
give
up
this
nonsense
at
once
evadne
arms
dropped
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
with
fingers
interlaced
in
front
of
her
looking
down
at
her
mother
for
a
moment
and
then
up
at
the
cathedral
her
talent
for
silence
came
in
naturally
here
you
do
say
anything
because
you
know
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
for
you
frayling
began
you
broken
my
heart
evadne
indeed
you
have
and
after
everything
had
gone
off
so
well
too
what
a
tragedy
how
could
you
forget
and
on
the
very
day
itself
your
wedding
day
just
think
why
we
keep
ours
every
year
and
all
your
beautiful
presents
and
such
a
trousseau
i
am
sure
no
girl
was
ever
more
kindly
considered
by
father
mother
friends
everybody
she
was
obliged
to
stop
short
for
a
moment
ideas
by
which
she
was
not
much
troubled
as
a
rule
had
suddenly
crowded
in
so
thick
upon
her
when
she
began
to
speak
that
she
became
bewildered
and
in
an
honest
attempt
to
make
the
most
of
them
all
only
succeeded
in
laying
hold
of
an
end
of
each
to
the
great
let
and
hindrance
of
all
coherency
as
she
herself
felt
when
she
pulled
up
yes
you
may
well
look
up
at
the
cathedral
she
began
again
unreasonably
provoked
by
evadne
attitude
but
what
good
does
it
do
you
i
should
have
supposed
that
the
hallowed
associations
of
this
place
would
have
restored
you
to
a
better
frame
of
mind
i
do
feel
the
force
of
association
strongly
evadne
answered
and
that
is
why
i
shrink
from
major
colquhoun
people
have
their
associations
as
well
as
places
and
those
that
cling
about
him
are
anything
but
hallowed
mrs
frayling
assumed
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
depression
i
never
heard
a
girl
talk
so
in
my
life
she
said
it
is
positively
indelicate
it
really
is
but
have
done
all
we
could
now
honestly
have
you
anything
to
complain
of
nothing
mother
nothing
evadne
exclaimed
oh
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
understand
what
is
there
to
understand
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
that
you
have
behaved
outrageously
and
written
letters
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
quoting
scripture
too
for
your
own
purposes
i
can
not
think
that
you
are
in
your
right
mind
evadne
i
really
can
not
no
girl
ever
acted
so
before
if
only
you
would
read
your
bible
properly
and
say
your
prayers
you
would
see
for
yourself
and
repent
besides
what
is
to
become
of
you
we
ca
have
you
at
home
again
you
know
how
we
are
any
of
us
to
appear
in
the
neighbourhood
if
the
story
gets
about
and
of
course
it
must
get
about
if
you
persist
i
can
not
think
and
everybody
said
too
how
sweet
you
looked
on
your
wedding
day
evadne
but
i
said
when
those
children
changed
clothes
it
was
unnatural
and
would
bring
bad
luck
and
there
was
a
terrible
gale
blowing
too
and
it
rained
everything
went
so
well
up
to
the
very
day
itself
but
since
then
for
no
reason
at
all
but
your
own
wicked
obstinacy
all
has
gone
wrong
you
ought
to
have
been
coming
back
from
your
honeymoon
soon
now
and
here
you
are
in
hiding
yes
literally
hiding
like
a
ashamed
to
be
seen
it
mast
be
a
terrible
trial
for
my
poor
sister
olive
and
a
great
imposition
on
her
good
nature
having
you
here
you
consider
no
one
and
i
might
have
been
a
grandmother
in
time
too
although
i
do
so
much
mind
about
that
for
i
do
think
it
is
any
blessing
to
a
military
man
to
have
a
family
they
have
to
move
about
so
much
but
however
all
that
it
seems
is
over
and
your
poor
sisters
five
of
them
are
curious
to
know
what
george
is
doing
all
this
time
at
fraylingay
and
asking
questions
you
can
not
have
imagined
difficulties
or
you
never
would
have
been
so
selfish
and
unnatural
i
had
to
box
barbara
ears
the
other
day
i
had
indeed
and
who
will
marry
them
now
i
should
like
to
know
if
only
you
had
turned
roman
catholic
and
gone
into
a
convent
or
died
or
never
been
born
oh
dear
oh
dear
evadne
looked
down
at
her
mother
again
she
was
very
white
but
she
did
not
utter
a
word
why
do
you
speak
frayling
exclaimed
why
do
you
stand
there
like
a
stone
or
statue
deaf
to
all
my
arguments
evadne
sighed
mother
i
will
do
anything
you
suggest
except
the
one
thing
i
will
not
live
with
major
colquhoun
as
his
wife
she
said
i
thought
so
frayling
exclaimed
you
will
do
everything
but
what
you
ought
to
do
it
is
just
what
your
father
says
once
you
a
girl
you
can
do
nothing
with
her
she
gives
herself
such
airs
and
you
have
managed
to
yourself
somehow
although
remains
a
mystery
but
one
thing
i
am
determined
upon
your
poor
sisters
shall
never
have
a
book
i
do
know
off
by
heart
myself
i
shall
lock
them
all
up
not
that
it
is
much
use
for
no
one
will
marry
them
now
no
man
will
ever
come
to
the
house
again
to
be
robbed
of
his
character
as
major
colquhoun
has
been
by
you
i
am
sure
no
one
ever
knew
anything
bad
about
him
at
least
never
did
whatever
your
father
may
have
done
until
you
went
and
ferreted
all
those
dreadful
stories
out
you
are
shameless
evadne
you
really
are
and
what
good
have
you
done
by
it
all
i
should
like
to
know
when
you
might
have
done
so
much
too
frayling
paused
here
and
evadne
looked
up
at
the
cathedral
again
feeling
for
her
pitifully
this
new
view
of
her
mother
was
another
terrible
disillusion
and
the
more
the
poor
lady
exposed
herself
the
greater
evadne
felt
was
the
claim
she
had
upon
her
filial
tenderness
why
do
you
say
something
frayling
recommenced
mother
what
i
say
if
you
knew
what
a
time
i
have
had
with
your
father
and
your
husband
you
would
pity
me
i
can
assure
you
george
has
been
so
sullen
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
him
and
the
trouble
i
have
had
and
the
excuses
i
have
made
for
you
i
am
quite
worn
out
he
said
if
you
were
that
kind
of
girl
yon
might
go
and
i
had
to
go
down
on
my
knees
to
him
almost
to
make
him
forgive
you
and
now
i
will
go
down
on
my
knees
to
you
she
exclaimed
acting
on
a
veritable
inspiration
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
to
beg
you
for
the
sake
of
your
sisters
and
for
the
love
of
god
not
to
disgrace
us
all
oh
mother
no
do
do
that
get
up
do
get
up
this
is
too
dreadful
evadne
cried
almost
hysterically
here
i
shall
kneel
until
you
give
in
frayling
sobbed
clasping
her
hands
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
to
her
daughter
and
conscious
of
the
strength
of
her
position
evadne
tried
in
vain
to
raise
her
her
bonnet
had
slipped
to
one
side
her
dress
had
been
caught
up
by
the
heels
of
her
boots
and
the
soles
were
showing
behind
her
mantle
was
disarranged
she
was
a
figure
for
a
farce
but
evadne
saw
only
her
own
mother
shaken
with
sobs
on
her
knees
before
her
mother
mother
she
cried
sinking
into
a
chair
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
to
hide
the
dreadful
spectacle
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
suggest
something
if
you
would
even
consent
frayling
began
gathering
herself
up
slowly
and
standing
over
her
daughter
if
you
would
even
consent
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
until
you
get
used
to
him
and
forget
all
this
nonsense
i
am
sure
he
would
agree
for
he
is
afraid
of
scandal
evadne
i
never
knew
a
man
more
so
in
fact
he
shows
nothing
but
right
and
proper
feeling
and
you
will
love
him
as
much
as
ever
again
when
you
know
him
better
and
get
over
all
these
exaggerated
ideas
consent
to
this
dear
child
for
my
sake
you
shall
have
your
own
way
in
everything
else
and
i
will
arrange
it
all
for
you
and
get
his
written
promise
to
allow
you
to
live
in
his
house
quite
independently
like
brother
and
sister
as
long
as
you
like
and
there
will
be
no
awkwardness
for
you
whatever
do
my
child
do
consent
to
this
and
the
poor
old
lady
knelt
once
more
and
put
her
arms
about
her
daughter
and
wept
aloud
evadne
broke
down
the
sight
of
the
dear
face
so
distorted
the
poor
lips
quivering
the
kind
eyes
all
swollen
and
blurred
with
tears
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
and
cried
i
consent
mother
for
your
sake
to
keep
up
appearances
but
only
that
mother
you
promise
me
you
will
arrange
all
that
i
promise
you
my
dear
i
promise
frayling
rejoined
rising
with
alacrity
her
countenance
clearing
on
the
instant
her
heart
swelling
with
the
joy
and
pride
of
a
great
victory
she
knew
she
had
done
what
the
whole
bench
of
bishops
could
not
have
done
nor
that
most
remarkable
man
her
husband
either
for
the
matter
of
that
and
she
enjoyed
her
triumph
as
she
had
anticipated
major
colquhoun
made
no
difficulty
about
the
arrangement
i
should
not
care
a
rap
for
an
unwilling
wife
he
said
let
her
go
way
and
i
go
mine
all
i
want
now
is
to
keep
up
appearances
it
would
be
a
deuced
nasty
thing
for
me
if
the
story
got
about
fellows
would
think
there
was
more
in
it
than
there
is
but
she
will
come
round
said
frayling
if
only
you
are
nice
to
her
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
she
is
sure
to
come
round
oh
of
course
she
will
frayling
decided
and
major
colquhoun
smiled
complacently
he
often
asserted
that
there
was
no
knowing
women
but
he
took
credit
to
himself
for
a
superior
knowledge
of
the
sex
all
the
same
chapter
xvii
before
writing
the
promise
which
evadne
required
major
colquhoun
begged
to
be
allowed
to
have
an
interview
with
her
and
to
this
also
she
consented
at
her
mother
earnest
solicitation
although
the
idea
of
it
went
very
much
against
the
grain
she
perceived
however
that
the
first
meeting
must
be
awkward
in
any
case
and
she
was
one
of
those
energetic
people
who
when
there
is
a
disagreeable
thing
to
be
done
do
it
and
get
it
over
at
once
so
she
strengthened
her
mind
by
adding
a
touch
of
severity
to
her
costume
and
sat
herself
down
in
the
drawing
room
with
a
book
on
her
lap
when
the
morning
came
well
nerved
for
the
interview
her
heart
began
to
beat
unpleasantly
when
he
rang
and
she
heard
him
in
the
hall
doubtless
inquiring
for
her
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
arose
from
her
seat
involuntarily
and
stood
literally
awaiting
in
fear
and
trembling
the
dreadful
moment
of
meeting
what
a
horrible
sensation
she
ejaculated
mentally
colonel
colquhoun
the
servant
announced
he
entered
with
an
air
of
displeasure
he
could
not
conceal
and
bowed
to
her
from
a
distance
stiffly
but
although
she
looked
hard
at
him
she
could
not
see
him
so
great
was
her
trepidation
it
was
she
however
who
was
the
first
to
speak
i
i
nervous
she
gasped
clasping
her
hands
and
holding
them
out
to
him
piteously
colonel
colquhoun
relaxed
it
flattered
his
vanity
to
perceive
that
this
curiously
and
exceedingly
young
lady
became
as
weakly
emotional
as
any
ordinary
school
girl
the
moment
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
him
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
blandly
assured
her
will
you
sit
down
evadne
managed
to
mumble
dropping
into
her
own
chair
again
from
sheer
inability
to
stand
any
longer
colonel
colquhoun
took
a
seat
at
an
exaggerated
distance
from
her
his
idea
was
to
impress
her
with
a
sense
of
his
extreme
delicacy
but
the
act
had
a
contrary
effect
upon
her
his
manners
had
been
perfect
so
far
as
she
had
hitherto
seen
them
but
thus
to
emphasize
an
already
sufficiently
awkward
position
was
not
good
taste
and
she
registered
the
fact
against
him
after
they
were
seated
there
was
a
painful
pause
evadne
knit
her
brows
and
cast
about
in
her
mind
for
something
to
say
suddenly
the
fact
that
the
maid
had
announced
him
as
colonel
colquhoun
recurred
to
her
have
you
been
promoted
she
asked
very
naturally
yes
he
answered
i
congratulate
you
she
faltered
again
he
bowed
stiffly
but
evadne
was
recovering
herself
she
could
look
at
him
now
and
it
surprised
her
to
find
that
he
was
not
in
appearance
the
monster
she
had
been
picturing
him
no
more
a
monster
indeed
than
he
had
seemed
before
she
knew
of
his
past
until
now
however
except
for
that
one
glimpse
in
the
carriage
she
had
always
seen
him
through
such
a
haze
of
feeling
as
to
make
the
seeing
practically
null
and
void
so
far
as
any
perception
of
his
true
character
might
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
and
useless
for
anything
really
but
ordinary
purposes
of
identification
now
however
that
the
misty
veil
of
passion
was
withdrawn
from
her
eyes
the
man
whom
she
had
thought
noble
she
saw
to
be
merely
big
the
face
which
had
seemed
to
beam
with
intellect
certainly
remained
still
but
it
was
like
the
work
of
a
talented
artist
when
it
lacks
the
perfectly
perceptible
indefinable
finishing
touch
of
genius
that
would
have
raised
it
above
criticism
and
drawn
you
back
to
it
again
but
wanting
which
after
the
first
glance
of
admiration
interest
fails
and
you
pass
on
only
convinced
of
a
certain
cleverness
a
thing
that
soon
satiates
without
satisfying
evadne
had
seen
soul
in
her
lover
eyes
but
now
they
struck
her
as
hard
shallow
glittering
and
obtrusively
blue
and
she
noticed
that
his
forehead
although
high
shelved
back
abruptly
to
the
crown
of
his
head
which
dipped
down
again
sheer
to
the
back
of
his
neck
a
very
precipice
without
a
single
boss
upon
which
to
rest
a
hope
of
some
saving
grace
in
the
way
of
eminent
social
qualities
thank
heaven
i
see
you
as
you
are
in
time
thought
evadne
colonel
colquhoun
was
the
next
to
speak
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
rather
a
better
position
now
he
said
yes
she
replied
but
she
did
not
at
all
appreciate
the
advantage
because
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
in
an
inferior
position
may
i
speak
to
you
with
reference
to
our
future
relations
he
continued
she
bowed
a
kind
of
cold
assent
then
looked
at
him
expectantly
her
eyes
opening
wide
and
her
heart
thumping
horribly
in
the
very
natural
perturbation
which
again
seized
upon
her
as
they
approached
the
subject
yet
in
spite
of
her
quite
perceptible
agitation
there
was
both
dignity
and
determination
in
her
attitude
and
colonel
colquhoun
meeting
the
unflinching
glance
direct
became
suddenly
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
timid
little
girl
with
sleepy
eyes
he
had
had
such
a
fancy
for
and
this
young
lady
modestly
shrinking
in
every
inch
of
her
sensitive
frame
but
undaunted
in
spirit
nevertheless
were
two
very
different
people
there
had
been
misapprehension
of
character
on
both
sides
it
seemed
but
he
liked
pluck
and
by
jove
the
girl
was
handsomer
than
he
had
imagined
views
or
no
views
he
would
lay
siege
to
her
senses
in
earnest
there
would
be
some
satisfaction
in
such
a
conquest
is
there
no
hope
for
me
evadne
he
pleaded
none
none
she
burst
out
impetuously
becoming
desperate
in
her
embarrassment
but
i
can
not
discuss
the
subject
i
beg
you
will
let
it
drop
her
one
idea
was
to
get
rid
of
this
big
blond
man
who
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
in
his
eyes
from
which
now
that
her
own
passion
was
dead
she
shrunk
in
revolt
again
colonel
colquhoun
bowed
stiffly
as
you
please
he
said
my
only
wish
is
to
please
you
he
paused
for
a
reply
but
as
evadne
had
nothing
more
to
say
he
was
obliged
to
recommence
the
regiment
he
said
is
going
to
malta
at
once
and
i
must
go
with
it
and
what
i
would
venture
to
suggest
is
that
you
should
follow
when
you
feel
inclined
by
and
fellows
will
understand
that
i
do
care
to
have
you
come
out
on
a
troopship
and
i
should
like
to
get
your
rooms
fitted
up
for
you
too
before
you
arrive
i
am
anxious
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
meet
your
wishes
i
will
make
every
arrangement
with
that
end
in
view
and
if
you
can
suggest
anything
yourself
that
does
not
occur
to
me
i
shall
be
glad
you
had
better
bring
an
english
maid
out
with
you
or
a
german
frenchwomen
are
flighty
he
got
up
as
he
said
this
and
added
you
like
malta
i
think
it
is
a
bright
little
place
and
very
jolly
in
the
season
evadne
rose
too
thank
you
she
said
you
are
showing
me
more
consideration
than
i
have
any
right
to
expect
and
i
am
sure
to
be
satisfied
with
any
arrangement
you
may
think
it
right
to
make
i
will
telegraph
to
you
when
my
arrangements
for
your
reception
are
complete
he
concluded
and
i
think
that
is
all
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
she
answered
then
he
said
she
rejoined
and
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
voyage
and
all
possible
success
with
your
regiment
thank
you
he
answered
putting
his
heels
together
and
making
her
a
profound
bow
as
he
spoke
so
they
parted
and
he
went
his
way
through
the
old
cathedral
close
with
that
set
expression
of
countenance
which
he
had
worn
when
he
first
became
aware
of
her
flight
but
curiously
enough
although
he
had
no
atom
of
feeling
left
for
her
and
the
amount
of
thought
she
had
displayed
in
her
letters
had
shocked
his
most
cherished
prejudices
on
the
subject
of
her
sex
she
had
gained
in
his
estimation
he
liked
her
pluck
he
felt
she
could
be
nothing
but
a
credit
to
him
she
remained
for
a
few
seconds
as
he
had
left
her
listening
to
his
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
the
shutting
of
the
door
and
then
from
where
she
stood
she
saw
him
pass
and
watched
him
out
of
sight
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
certainly
and
she
sighed
she
had
been
touched
by
his
consideration
and
thought
it
a
pity
that
such
a
kindly
disposition
should
be
unsupported
by
the
solid
qualities
which
alone
could
command
her
lasting
respect
and
affection
she
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
there
drumming
idly
on
the
glass
thinking
over
the
conclusion
they
had
come
to
for
some
time
after
colonel
colquhoun
had
disappeared
she
felt
it
to
be
a
lame
one
and
she
was
far
from
satisfied
but
what
under
the
circumstances
would
have
been
a
better
arrangement
the
persistent
question
contained
in
itself
its
own
answer
only
the
prospect
was
blank
blank
the
excitement
of
the
contest
was
over
now
the
reaction
had
set
in
she
ventured
to
look
forward
and
seeing
for
the
first
time
what
was
before
her
the
long
dark
dreary
level
of
a
hopelessly
uncongenial
existence
reaching
from
here
to
eternity
as
it
seemed
from
her
present
point
of
view
her
nerves
gave
way
and
when
orton
beg
came
to
her
a
moment
later
she
threw
herself
into
her
arms
and
sobbed
hysterically
oh
auntie
i
have
suffered
horribly
i
wish
i
were
dead
chapter
xviii
the
first
news
that
evadne
received
on
arriving
in
malta
was
contained
in
a
letter
from
her
mother
it
announced
that
her
father
had
determined
to
cut
her
off
from
all
communication
with
her
family
until
she
came
to
her
senses
she
had
remained
quiety
with
orton
beg
until
it
was
time
to
leave
england
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
fraylingay
she
shrank
from
occupying
her
old
rooms
in
her
new
state
of
mind
and
she
would
not
have
thought
of
proposing
such
a
thing
herself
but
she
did
half
expect
to
be
asked
this
not
liking
to
return
home
not
recognizing
it
as
home
any
longer
or
herself
as
having
any
right
to
go
there
uninvited
marked
the
change
in
her
position
and
made
her
realize
it
with
a
pang
her
mother
came
and
went
but
she
brought
no
message
from
her
father
nor
ever
mentioned
him
something
in
ourselves
warns
us
at
once
of
any
change
of
feeling
in
a
friend
and
evadne
asked
no
questions
and
sent
no
messages
either
but
this
attitude
did
not
satisfy
her
father
at
all
he
thought
it
her
duty
clearly
to
throw
herself
at
his
feet
and
beg
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
and
he
waited
for
her
to
make
some
sign
of
contrition
until
his
patience
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
then
he
asked
his
wife
has
evadne
eh
what
is
her
attitude
at
present
she
is
perfectly
cheerful
and
happy
frayling
replied
she
expresses
no
remorse
for
her
most
unjustifiable
conduct
she
thinks
she
only
did
what
is
right
frayling
reminded
him
then
she
is
quite
indifferent
to
my
opinion
he
began
swelling
visibly
and
getting
red
in
the
face
has
she
asked
what
i
think
does
she
ever
mention
me
no
never
frayling
declared
apprehensively
a
most
unnatural
child
he
exclaimed
in
his
pompous
way
a
most
unnatural
child
it
was
after
this
that
he
became
obstinately
determined
to
cut
evadne
off
from
all
communication
with
her
friends
until
she
should
become
reconciled
to
colonel
colquhoun
as
a
husband
frayling
was
not
an
astute
man
he
was
simply
incapable
of
sitting
down
and
working
out
a
deliberate
scheme
of
punishment
which
should
have
the
effect
of
bringing
evadne
unruly
spirit
into
what
he
considered
proper
subjection
in
this
matter
he
acted
not
upon
any
system
which
he
could
have
reduced
to
writing
but
rather
as
the
lower
animals
do
when
they
build
nests
or
burrow
in
the
ground
or
repeat
generation
after
generation
other
arrangements
of
a
like
nature
with
a
precision
which
the
cumulative
practice
of
the
race
makes
perfect
in
each
individual
he
possessed
a
certain
faculty
transmitted
from
father
to
son
that
gives
the
stupidest
man
a
power
in
his
dealings
with
women
which
the
brightest
intelligence
would
not
acquire
without
it
and
he
used
to
obtain
his
end
with
the
decision
of
instinct
which
is
always
neater
and
more
effectual
than
reason
and
artifice
in
such
matters
he
denied
hotly
for
instance
that
evadne
had
any
natural
affection
and
yet
it
was
upon
that
woman
weakness
of
hers
that
he
set
to
work
at
once
proving
himself
to
be
possessed
of
a
perfect
if
unconscious
knowledge
of
her
most
vulnerable
point
and
he
displayed
much
ingenuity
in
his
manner
of
making
it
a
means
of
torture
he
let
no
hint
of
the
cruel
edict
be
breathed
before
she
went
abroad
she
might
have
altered
her
arrangements
had
she
known
of
it
before
and
remained
with
orton
beg
and
there
was
something
of
foresight
too
in
timing
her
mother
letter
of
farewell
good
advice
pious
exhortation
and
plaintive
reproach
to
meet
her
on
her
arrival
to
greet
her
on
the
threshold
of
her
new
life
and
make
her
realize
the
terrible
gulf
which
she
was
setting
between
herself
and
those
who
were
dearest
to
her
by
her
obstinacy
the
object
was
to
make
her
suffer
and
she
did
suffer
but
her
cruelty
did
not
alter
the
facts
of
the
case
or
appeal
to
her
reason
as
an
argument
worthy
to
influence
her
decision
orton
beg
ventured
to
express
her
opinion
to
frayling
on
the
subject
seriously
she
often
said
more
to
him
in
her
quiet
way
than
most
people
would
have
dared
to
i
think
you
are
making
a
mistake
she
said
what
he
exclaimed
ready
to
bluster
would
you
have
me
countenance
such
conduct
why
it
is
perfectly
revolutionary
if
other
women
follow
her
example
not
one
man
in
ten
will
be
able
to
get
a
wife
when
he
wants
to
marry
it
is
very
terrible
she
answered
in
her
even
way
to
hear
that
so
large
a
majority
will
be
condemned
to
celibacy
but
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
good
grounds
for
making
the
assertion
that
is
not
the
point
however
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
the
risk
you
run
of
bringing
more
serious
trouble
on
yourself
by
cutting
evadne
adrift
from
every
influence
of
her
happy
childhood
and
casting
her
lot
among
strangers
and
into
a
world
of
intrigue
alone
she
will
come
to
her
senses
when
she
finds
herself
so
situated
perhaps
he
retorted
testily
and
if
she
does
not
it
will
just
show
that
she
is
incorrigible
evadne
answered
this
last
letter
of
her
mother
with
dignity
of
course
i
regret
my
father
decision
she
wrote
and
i
consider
it
neither
right
nor
wise
but
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
writing
to
you
regularly
every
mail
nevertheless
i
know
my
letters
will
be
a
pleasure
to
you
although
you
can
not
answer
them
but
where
is
the
reason
and
right
mother
in
this
decision
of
my
father
we
both
know
you
and
i
that
it
is
merely
the
outcome
of
irritation
caused
by
a
difference
of
opinion
and
no
more
binding
in
reason
upon
you
than
upon
me
when
frayling
received
this
letter
she
wrote
a
hurried
note
to
evadne
saying
that
she
did
think
her
husband
unreasonable
and
also
that
he
had
no
right
to
separate
her
from
any
of
her
children
and
that
therefore
she
should
write
to
evadne
as
often
as
she
liked
but
without
letting
him
know
it
she
thought
his
injustice
quite
justified
such
tactics
but
evadne
answered
no
there
has
been
too
much
of
that
kind
of
cowardice
among
women
already
she
wrote
whatever
we
do
we
should
do
openly
and
fearlessly
we
are
not
the
property
of
our
husbands
they
do
not
buy
us
we
are
perfectly
free
agents
to
write
to
whomsoever
we
please
and
so
long
as
we
order
our
lives
in
all
honour
and
decency
they
have
no
more
right
to
interfere
with
us
than
we
with
them
tell
him
once
for
all
that
you
see
no
reason
in
his
request
and
write
openly
what
can
he
do
storm
i
suppose
but
storming
is
no
proof
of
his
right
to
interfere
between
you
and
me
once
on
a
time
the
ignorant
were
taught
to
believe
that
the
lord
spoke
in
the
thunder
and
they
could
be
influenced
through
their
terror
and
respect
to
do
anything
while
an
opportune
storm
was
raging
and
when
women
were
weak
and
ignorant
men
used
their
wrath
in
much
the
same
way
to
convince
them
of
error
to
us
educated
as
we
are
however
an
outburst
of
rage
is
about
as
effectual
an
argument
as
a
clap
of
thunder
would
be
both
are
startling
i
grant
but
what
do
they
prove
i
have
seen
my
father
in
a
rage
his
face
swells
and
gets
very
red
he
prances
up
and
down
the
room
he
shouts
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
presents
altogether
a
very
disagreeable
spectacle
which
one
never
quite
forgets
but
he
can
not
go
like
that
forever
mother
so
tell
him
gently
you
have
been
thinking
about
his
proposition
and
are
sorry
that
you
find
you
must
differ
from
him
but
you
consider
that
it
is
clearly
your
duty
to
correspond
with
me
then
sit
still
and
say
nothing
and
let
him
storm
till
he
is
tired
and
when
he
goes
out
and
bangs
the
door
finish
your
letter
and
put
it
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
hall
table
to
be
posted
he
will
scarcely
tear
it
up
but
if
he
does
write
another
send
it
to
the
post
yourself
and
tell
him
you
have
done
so
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
be
open
before
everything
and
stand
upon
your
dignity
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
indeed
when
an
honourable
woman
only
dares
to
write
to
her
own
daughter
surreptitiously
as
if
she
were
doing
something
she
should
be
ashamed
of
poor
frayling
was
not
equal
to
such
opposition
she
would
rather
have
faced
a
thunderstorm
than
her
husband
in
his
wrath
so
she
concealed
evadne
letter
from
him
and
wrote
to
her
again
surreptitiously
in
order
to
reproach
her
for
seeming
to
insinuate
that
she
her
mother
would
stoop
to
do
anything
underhand
evadne
sighed
when
she
received
this
letter
and
thought
of
letting
the
matter
drop
why
should
she
dislike
to
see
her
father
in
the
position
unreasonable
husbands
and
fathers
usually
occupy
that
of
being
ostensibly
obeyed
while
in
reality
they
are
carefully
kept
in
the
dark
as
to
what
is
going
on
about
them
and
why
should
she
object
to
allow
her
mother
to
act
as
so
many
other
worthy
but
weak
women
daily
do
in
and
for
the
love
of
peace
and
quietness
there
seemed
to
be
no
great
good
to
be
gained
by
persisting
and
she
might
perhaps
have
ended
by
acquiescing
under
protest
if
her
mother
had
not
added
by
way
of
postscript
i
doubt
very
much
if
i
shall
be
allowed
to
receive
your
letters
your
father
will
probably
send
any
he
may
capture
straight
back
to
you
and
at
any
rate
he
will
insist
upon
seeing
them
so
do
not
my
dear
child
allude
to
having
heard
from
me
i
earnestly
entreat
you
to
remember
this
but
the
request
only
made
evadne
blood
boil
again
she
did
not
belong
to
the
old
corrupt
state
of
things
herself
and
she
would
not
submit
to
anything
savouring
of
deceit
if
her
mother
were
too
weak
to
assert
her
own
independence
she
felt
herself
forced
to
do
it
for
her
so
she
wrote
to
her
father
sharply
my
mother
tells
me
that
you
intend
to
stop
all
communication
between
her
and
myself
i
consider
that
you
have
no
right
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
and
unless
i
hear
from
her
regularly
in
answer
to
my
letters
i
shall
be
reluctantly
compelled
to
send
a
detailed
statement
of
my
case
to
every
paper
in
the
kingdom
in
order
to
find
out
from
my
fellow
countrywomen
what
their
opinion
of
your
action
in
the
matter
is
and
also
what
they
would
advise
us
to
do
you
know
my
mother
affection
for
you
you
have
never
had
any
reason
to
complain
of
want
of
devotion
on
her
part
and
when
you
make
your
disagreement
with
me
a
whip
to
scourge
her
with
you
are
guilty
of
an
unjustifiable
act
of
oppression
this
letter
arrived
at
fraylingay
late
one
afternoon
and
was
handed
to
frayling
on
his
return
from
a
pleasant
country
ride
he
read
it
standing
in
the
hall
and
lost
his
equanimity
at
once
where
is
mrs
frayling
he
asked
a
servant
who
happened
to
be
passing
speaking
in
a
way
which
caused
the
man
to
remark
afterward
that
frayling
was
going
to
catch
it
about
somethin
and
seemed
to
think
made
away
with
frayling
was
in
the
drawing
room
writing
one
of
her
pleasant
chatty
letters
to
a
friend
in
india
with
a
cheerful
expression
on
her
comely
countenance
and
all
recollections
of
her
domestic
difficulties
banished
for
the
moment
when
frayling
entered
in
his
riding
dress
with
his
whip
in
his
hand
and
his
hat
on
his
head
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
most
punctilious
with
strange
ladies
but
do
not
feel
it
necessary
to
behave
like
gentlemen
in
the
presence
of
their
own
wives
making
it
appear
as
if
the
latter
had
lost
cast
and
forfeited
all
claim
to
their
respect
by
marrying
them
frayling
looked
round
from
her
writing
and
smiled
have
you
had
a
nice
ride
dear
she
said
read
that
he
exclaimed
slapping
evadne
letter
with
his
whip
and
then
throwing
it
down
on
the
table
before
her
rudely
read
that
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
your
daughter
now
frayling
fair
face
clouded
on
the
instant
and
her
affectionate
heart
which
had
been
so
happily
expanded
the
moment
before
by
the
kind
thoughts
about
her
absent
friend
that
came
crowding
as
she
wrote
to
her
contracted
now
with
a
painful
spasm
of
nervous
apprehension
she
read
the
letter
through
and
then
put
it
down
on
the
table
beside
her
without
a
word
she
did
not
look
at
her
husband
but
at
some
miniatures
which
hung
on
the
wall
before
her
they
were
portraits
of
her
own
people
father
mother
grandmother
a
great
aunt
and
uncle
and
other
near
relations
together
with
a
brother
and
sister
much
older
than
herself
and
both
dead
and
forgotten
as
a
rule
but
at
that
moment
all
that
she
had
ever
known
of
them
details
of
merry
games
together
and
childish
naughtinesses
which
got
them
into
trouble
at
the
time
but
made
them
appear
to
have
been
only
amusingly
mischievous
now
recurred
to
her
in
one
great
flash
of
memory
which
showed
her
also
some
lost
illusions
of
her
early
girlhood
about
a
husband
love
and
tenderness
his
constant
friendship
the
careful
patient
teaching
of
the
more
powerful
mind
which
was
to
strengthen
her
mind
and
enlarge
it
too
and
the
constant
companionship
which
would
banish
for
ever
the
indefinite
gnawing
sense
of
loneliness
from
which
all
healthy
young
unmated
creatures
suffer
she
had
actually
expected
at
one
time
to
be
more
to
her
husband
than
the
mere
docile
female
of
his
own
kind
which
was
all
he
wanted
his
wife
to
be
she
had
had
aspirations
which
had
caused
her
to
yearn
for
help
to
develop
something
beyond
the
animal
side
of
her
proving
the
possession
in
embryo
of
faculties
other
than
those
which
had
survived
frayling
rule
but
her
nature
was
plastic
one
of
those
which
requires
the
strong
and
delicate
hand
of
a
master
to
mould
it
into
distinct
and
lovely
form
motherhood
as
it
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
delicate
dreams
of
those
young
days
had
promised
to
be
a
beautiful
and
blessed
privilege
but
then
the
children
of
her
happy
imaginings
had
been
less
her
own
than
those
of
the
shadowy
perfection
who
was
to
have
been
her
husband
she
had
little
sense
of
humour
but
yet
she
could
have
smiled
when
in
this
moment
of
absolute
insight
she
saw
the
ideal
compared
with
the
real
husband
this
great
fat
country
gentleman
the
folly
of
having
expected
even
motherhood
with
such
a
father
for
her
children
to
be
anything
but
unsatisfactory
and
disappointing
at
the
best
dawned
upon
her
for
an
instant
with
disheartening
effect
but
fortunately
the
outlook
was
so
hopeless
there
seemed
nothing
more
to
sigh
for
and
so
she
sat
for
once
looking
up
at
the
miniatures
without
washing
out
with
tears
the
little
mental
strength
she
had
left
frayling
waited
impatiently
for
her
to
make
some
remark
when
she
had
read
evadne
letter
almost
anything
she
could
have
said
must
have
given
him
some
further
food
for
provocation
and
there
is
nothing
more
gratifying
to
an
angry
man
than
fresh
fuel
for
his
wrath
however
silence
sometimes
fans
the
flame
as
effectually
as
words
and
it
did
so
on
this
occasion
for
having
waited
till
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
burst
out
so
suddenly
that
frayling
raised
her
large
soft
white
hand
to
the
heavy
braids
which
it
was
then
the
fashion
to
pile
high
on
the
head
and
have
hanging
down
in
two
rows
to
the
nape
of
the
neck
behind
as
if
she
expected
them
to
be
disarranged
by
the
concussion
may
i
ask
if
you
approve
of
that
letter
he
demanded
but
she
only
set
her
lips
frayling
took
a
turn
about
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
holding
his
riding
whip
upright
and
flicking
himself
between
the
shoulders
with
it
as
he
went
let
her
write
to
the
papers
he
exclaimed
addressing
the
pictures
on
the
walls
as
if
he
were
sure
of
their
sympathy
let
her
write
to
the
papers
i
do
care
what
she
does
i
cast
her
off
forever
this
comes
of
the
higher
education
of
women
a
promising
specimen
woman
rights
indeed
woman
shamelessness
and
want
of
common
decency
once
she
is
let
loose
from
proper
control
she
make
the
matter
public
will
she
a
girl
of
nineteen
and
take
the
opinion
of
her
fellow
countrywomen
on
the
subject
egad
because
i
wo
let
her
mother
write
to
her
and
my
not
doing
so
is
an
unjustifiable
act
of
oppression
is
it
what
do
you
consider
it
yourself
he
demanded
of
his
wife
striding
up
to
her
and
standing
over
her
in
a
way
which
with
a
flourish
of
the
whip
was
unpleasantly
suggestive
of
an
impulse
to
visit
her
daughter
offence
upon
her
shoulders
actually
as
well
as
figuratively
frayling
did
not
shrink
but
her
comely
pink
and
white
face
usually
so
lineless
in
its
healthy
matronly
plumpness
suddenly
took
on
a
look
of
age
and
hardness
the
one
moment
of
horrid
repulsion
marking
it
more
deeply
than
years
of
those
household
cares
which
write
themselves
on
the
mind
without
contracting
the
heart
had
done
do
you
consider
he
repeated
that
i
have
been
guilty
of
an
unmanly
act
of
oppression
i
think
you
have
been
very
unkind
she
answered
meaning
the
same
thing
her
conduct
was
bad
enough
to
begin
with
but
now
it
will
be
ten
times
worse
she
will
write
to
the
papers
if
she
says
she
will
evadne
is
as
brave
you
ca
understand
her
courage
she
will
do
anything
she
thinks
right
and
now
there
will
be
a
public
scandal
after
all
we
have
done
to
prevent
it
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
show
your
face
again
anywhere
for
there
is
a
mother
in
the
country
from
her
majesty
downward
who
will
not
take
my
part
and
say
you
have
no
right
to
separate
me
from
my
daughter
i
know
what
the
end
of
it
will
be
he
roared
i
know
what
happens
when
women
leave
the
beaten
track
they
go
to
the
bad
altogether
that
what
will
happen
you
see
she
write
a
volume
next
to
prove
that
she
has
a
right
to
be
an
immoral
woman
if
she
chooses
she
be
a
common
hussey
yet
i
promise
you
said
frayling
stung
into
dignity
for
a
moment
and
rising
to
her
feet
in
order
to
confront
him
boldly
while
she
spoke
sir
i
have
been
a
good
and
loyal
wife
to
you
as
my
daughter
says
and
it
seems
she
was
right
too
when
she
declared
that
you
are
capable
of
making
your
disapproval
of
her
opinions
a
whip
to
scourge
me
with
but
i
warn
you
if
you
do
not
instantly
retract
that
cowardly
insult
i
shall
walk
straight
out
of
your
house
and
make
the
matter
public
myself
frayling
stared
at
her
i
i
beg
your
pardon
elizabeth
he
faltered
in
sheer
astonishment
what
with
you
and
your
daughter
i
am
provoked
past
endurance
i
do
know
what
i
am
saying
no
amount
of
provocation
justifies
such
an
attack
upon
your
reputation
frayling
rejoined
following
up
her
advantage
if
she
had
been
that
kind
of
girl
she
would
not
have
objected
to
colonel
colquhoun
and
at
any
rate
she
has
every
right
to
as
much
of
your
charity
as
you
give
him
women
are
different
frayling
ventured
feebly
are
they
said
frayling
some
of
evadne
wisdom
occurring
to
her
with
the
old
worn
axiom
upon
which
for
untold
ages
the
masculine
excuse
for
at
the
expense
of
the
woman
has
rested
i
believe
evadne
is
right
after
all
i
shall
get
out
her
letters
and
read
them
again
and
what
is
more
i
shall
write
to
her
just
as
often
as
i
please
frayling
stared
again
in
his
amazement
and
then
he
walked
out
of
the
room
without
uttering
another
word
he
had
not
foreseen
the
possibility
of
such
spirited
conduct
on
the
part
of
his
wife
but
since
she
had
ventured
to
revolt
the
question
of
a
public
scandal
was
disposed
of
and
that
being
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
he
said
no
more
salving
his
lust
of
power
with
the
reflection
that
by
deciding
the
question
for
herself
she
had
removed
all
responsibility
from
his
shoulders
and
proved
herself
to
be
a
contumacious
woman
and
blameworthy
so
long
as
there
is
no
risk
of
publicity
the
domestic
tyrannies
of
respectable
elderly
gentlemen
of
irascible
disposition
may
be
carried
to
any
length
but
once
there
is
a
threat
of
scandal
they
coil
up
by
that
one
act
of
overt
rebellion
frayling
secured
some
comfort
in
her
life
for
a
few
months
at
least
and
taught
her
husband
a
little
lesson
which
she
ought
to
have
endeavoured
to
inculcate
long
before
it
was
too
late
then
however
to
do
him
any
permanent
good
the
habit
of
the
was
formed
when
a
woman
sacrifices
her
individuality
and
the
right
of
private
judgment
at
the
outset
of
her
married
life
and
limits
herself
to
what
thou
biddest
unargued
i
obey
taking
it
for
granted
that
god
is
thy
law
without
making
any
inquiries
and
accepting
the
assertion
that
to
know
no
more
is
woman
happiest
knowledge
and
her
praise
as
confidently
as
if
the
wisdom
of
it
had
been
proved
beyond
a
doubt
and
its
truth
had
never
been
known
to
fail
in
a
single
instance
she
withdraws
from
her
poor
husband
all
the
help
of
her
keener
spiritual
perceptions
which
she
should
have
used
with
authority
to
hold
his
grosser
nature
in
check
and
leaves
him
to
drift
about
on
his
own
conceit
prejudices
and
inclinations
until
he
is
past
praying
for
there
was
a
temporary
lull
at
fraylingay
after
that
last
battle
during
which
frayling
wrote
to
her
daughter
freely
and
frequently
she
described
the
fight
she
had
had
for
her
rights
and
concluded
now
the
whole
difficulty
has
blown
over
and
i
have
no
more
opposition
to
contend
against
to
which
evadne
had
replied
in
a
few
words
judiciously
adding
before
the
curing
of
a
strong
disease
even
in
the
instant
of
repair
and
health
the
fit
is
strongest
evils
that
take
leave
on
their
departure

chapter
xix
it
came
to
be
pretty
generally
known
that
all
had
not
gone
well
with
the
colquhouns
immediately
after
their
marriage
something
of
the
story
had
of
necessity
leaked
out
through
the
servants
but
as
the
fraylings
had
the
precaution
common
to
their
class
to
keep
their
private
troubles
to
themselves
nobody
knew
precisely
what
the
difficulty
had
been
and
their
intimate
friends
whom
delicacy
debarred
from
making
inquiries
least
of
all
lady
adeline
just
mentioned
the
matter
to
orton
beg
and
asked
is
it
a
difficulty
that
may
be
discussed
no
better
not
i
think
the
latter
answered
and
of
course
the
subject
dropped
but
poor
lady
adeline
was
too
much
occupied
with
domestic
anxieties
of
her
own
at
that
time
to
feel
more
than
a
passing
gleam
of
sympathetic
interest
in
other
people
as
lord
dawne
had
hinted
to
orton
beg
it
was
now
a
question
of
how
best
to
educate
the
twins
their
parents
had
made
what
they
considered
suitable
arrangements
for
their
instruction
but
the
children
unfortunately
were
not
satisfied
with
these
they
had
had
a
governess
in
common
while
they
were
still
quite
small
but
had
ideas
about
the
superior
education
of
boys
and
consequently
when
the
children
had
outgrown
their
nursery
governess
he
decided
that
angelica
should
have
another
more
advanced
and
had
at
the
same
time
engaged
a
tutor
for
diavolo
sending
him
to
school
being
out
of
the
question
because
of
the
fear
of
further
trouble
from
the
artery
he
had
severed
when
this
arrangement
became
known
the
children
were
seen
to
put
their
heads
together
do
we
like
having
different
teachers
diavolo
inquired
tentatively
no
we
do
said
angelica
lady
adeline
had
tried
to
prepare
the
governess
but
the
latter
brought
no
experience
of
anything
like
angelica
to
help
her
to
understand
that
young
lady
and
so
the
warning
went
for
nothing
a
little
affection
goes
a
long
way
with
a
child
she
said
to
lady
adeline
and
i
always
endeavour
to
make
my
pupils
understand
that
i
care
for
them
and
do
not
wish
to
make
their
lessons
a
task
but
a
pleasure
to
them
it
is
a
good
system
i
should
think
lady
adeline
observed
speaking
dubiously
however
can
you
do
long
division
my
dear
the
governess
asked
angelica
when
they
sat
down
to
lessons
for
the
first
time
no
miss
apsley
angelica
answered
sweetly
then
i
will
show
you
how
but
you
must
attend
you
know
this
last
was
said
with
playful
authority
so
angelica
attended
how
did
you
get
on
this
morning
lady
adeline
asked
miss
apsley
anxiously
afterward
oh
perfectly
the
latter
answered
the
dear
child
was
all
interest
and
endeavour
lady
adeline
said
no
more
but
such
docility
was
unnatural
and
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
at
all
next
day
angelica
with
an
innocent
air
gave
miss
apsley
a
long
division
sum
which
she
had
completed
during
the
night
it
was
done
by
an
immense
number
of
figures
and
covered
four
sheets
of
foolscap
gummed
together
miss
apsley
worked
at
it
for
an
hour
to
verify
it
and
finding
it
quite
correct
she
decided
that
angelica
knew
long
division
enough
and
must
go
on
to
something
else
her
first
impression
was
that
she
had
secured
a
singularly
apt
pupil
and
she
was
much
surprised
when
she
began
to
teach
angelica
the
next
rule
in
arithmetic
to
find
that
she
could
make
the
dear
child
see
it
angelica
listened
and
tried
with
every
appearance
of
honest
intention
getting
red
and
hot
with
the
effort
and
she
would
not
put
the
slate
down
she
would
go
on
trying
till
her
head
ached
she
was
so
eager
to
learn
but
work
as
she
might
she
could
do
nothing
but
long
division
miss
apsley
said
she
had
never
known
anything
so
singular
lady
adeline
sighed
for
about
a
week
the
twins
lay
low
the
tutor
had
found
it
absolutely
impossible
to
teach
diavolo
anything
the
boy
was
perfectly
docile
he
would
sit
with
his
bright
eyes
riveted
on
his
master
face
listening
with
might
and
main
apparently
but
at
the
end
of
every
explanation
the
tutor
found
the
same
thing
diavolo
never
had
the
faintest
idea
of
what
he
had
been
talking
about
at
the
end
of
a
week
however
the
children
changed
their
tactics
when
lessons
ought
to
have
begun
one
morning
diavolo
went
to
miss
apsley
and
sat
himself
down
beside
her
in
angelica
place
with
a
smiling
countenance
and
without
a
word
of
explanation
while
angelica
presented
herself
to
the
tutor
with
all
diavolo
books
under
her
arm
please
sir
she
said
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
diavolo
and
i
find
that
we
were
mixed
somehow
wrong
and
i
got
his
mind
and
he
got
mine
i
can
do
his
lessons
quite
easily
but
i
ca
do
my
own
and
he
can
do
mine
but
he
ca
do
these
holding
up
the
books
it
like
this
you
see
i
ca
learn
from
a
lady
and
he
ca
learn
from
a
man
so
going
to
be
your
pupil
and
he
going
to
be
miss
apsley
you
understand
twins
i
expect
it
always
awkward
about
them
there
so
often
something
wrong
with
us
you
know
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
am
diavolo
and
is
me
the
tutor
and
governess
appealed
to
and
sent
for
the
twins
and
lectured
them
lady
adeline
sitting
by
seriously
perplexed
the
children
stood
to
attention
together
and
listened
respectfully
and
then
went
back
to
their
lessons
with
undeviating
cheerfulness
but
diavolo
did
angelica
and
angelica
did
his
diligently
and
none
other
would
they
do
but
this
state
of
things
could
not
continue
and
in
order
to
end
it
had
recourse
to
a
weak
expedient
which
he
had
more
than
once
successfully
employed
unknown
to
lady
adeline
he
sent
for
the
twins
and
consulted
their
wishes
privately
what
do
you
want
he
asked
well
sir
diavolo
answered
we
do
think
it
fair
for
angelica
only
to
have
a
beastly
governess
to
teach
her
when
she
knows
as
much
as
i
do
and
is
a
precious
sight
sharper
i
taught
you
all
you
know
diavolo
did
i
angelica
broke
in
yes
said
diavolo
with
a
wise
nod
and
it
is
beastly
unfair
she
continued
to
put
me
off
with
a
squeaking
governess
and
long
division
when
i
ought
to
be
doing
mathematics
and
latin
and
greek
my
dear
child
what
use
would
mathematics
and
latin
and
greek
be
to
you
protested
just
as
much
use
as
they
will
to
diavolo
she
answered
decidedly
he
does
know
half
as
much
about
the
good
of
education
as
i
do
just
ask
him
she
whisked
round
on
her
brother
as
she
spoke
and
demanded
tell
papa
diavolo
what
the
use
of
being
educated
i
am
sure
i
do
know
diavolo
answered
impressively
my
dear
boy
mathematics
are
an
education
in
themselves
began
didactically
moving
his
long
white
hands
in
a
way
that
always
suggested
lace
ruffles
they
will
teach
you
to
reason
then
they
teach
me
to
reason
too
said
angelica
setting
herself
down
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
as
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
intended
to
let
them
know
it
all
her
movements
were
quick
all
diavolo
deliberate
men
are
always
jeering
at
women
in
books
for
not
being
able
to
reason
and
going
to
learn
if
there
any
help
in
mathematics
she
continued
i
found
something
the
other
day
where
is
it
now
she
was
down
on
her
knees
in
a
moment
emptying
the
contents
of
her
pocket
on
to
the
floor
and
sifting
them
there
were
two
of
fine
texture
and
exceedingly
dirty
as
if
they
had
been
there
for
months
the
one
she
used
she
carried
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
or
up
her
sleeve
a
ball
of
string
a
catapult
and
some
swan
shot
a
silver
pen
a
pencil
holder
part
of
an
old
song
book
a
pocket
book
some
tin
tacks
a
knife
with
several
blades
and
scissors
etc
also
a
silver
fruit
knife
two
coloured
pencils
indiarubber
and
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
wrapped
round
a
piece
of
almond
toffee
this
was
apparently
what
she
wanted
for
she
took
it
off
the
toffee
threw
the
latter
into
the
grate
whither
diavolo
eyes
followed
it
regretfully
and
spread
the
paper
out
on
her
lap
whence
it
was
seen
to
be
covered
with
figures
here
you
are
she
said
i
copied
it
out
of
a
book
the
other
day
and
put
it
round
the
toffee
because
i
knew
i
should
be
wanting
that
and
then
i
should
see
it
every
time
i
took
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
not
forget
it
but
why
did
you
throw
the
toffee
away
said
diavolo
shut
up
and
listen
angelica
rejoined
from
the
floor
politely
and
then
she
began
to
read
make
men
wise
poets
witty
mathematics
subtle
natural
philosophy
deep
moral
grave
logic
and
rhetoric
able
to
contend
now
that
what
i
want
papa
i
want
to
know
all
that
and
have
a
good
time
and
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
contend
to
get
it
you
soon
learn
how
said
diavolo
encouragingly
had
always
enjoyed
his
children
precocity
and
provided
they
amused
him
they
could
make
him
do
anything
so
after
the
conference
he
announced
that
he
had
been
questioning
angelica
and
had
found
that
she
really
was
too
far
advanced
for
a
governess
and
he
had
therefore
decided
that
she
should
share
diavolo
lessons
with
the
tutor
the
governess
accordingly
disappeared
from
hamilton
house
the
first
tutor
found
that
he
had
no
vocation
for
teaching
and
left
also
and
another
was
procured
with
great
difficulty
and
at
considerable
expense
for
the
fame
of
the
heavenly
twins
was
and
their
parents
were
determined
besides
not
to
let
any
candidate
engage
himself
under
the
pleasing
delusion
that
the
task
of
teaching
them
would
be
something
of
a
sinecure
the
tutor
they
finally
secured
turned
out
to
be
a
very
good
fellow
fortunately
a
gentleman
and
with
a
keen
sense
of
humour
which
the
twins
appreciated
so
that
they
took
to
him
at
once
and
treated
him
pretty
well
on
the
whole
but
lessons
were
usually
a
lively
time
angelica
who
continued
to
be
the
taller
stronger
and
wickeder
of
the
two
soon
proved
herself
the
cleverer
also
like
evadne
she
was
consumed
by
the
rage
to
know
and
insisted
upon
dragging
diavolo
on
with
her
it
was
interesting
to
see
them
sitting
side
by
side
the
dark
head
touching
the
fair
one
as
they
bent
together
intently
over
some
problem
when
diavolo
was
not
quick
enough
angelica
would
rouse
him
up
in
the
old
way
by
knocking
her
head
which
was
still
the
harder
of
the
two
against
his
angelica
did
i
see
you
strike
your
brother
ellis
sternly
demanded
the
first
time
he
witnessed
this
performance
i
do
know
whether
you
saw
me
or
not
sir
but
i
certainly
did
strike
him
angelica
answered
irritably
why
to
wake
him
up
you
see
sir
diavolo
proceeded
to
explain
in
his
imperturbable
drawl
angelica
discovered
that
i
was
born
with
a
predisposition
to
be
a
muff
we
mostly
are
on
father
side
of
the
family
and
if
he
is
one
it
because
i
slapped
the
tendency
out
of
him
as
soon
as
i
perceived
it
angelica
interrupted
get
on
diavolo
i
no
patience
with
you
when
you
so
slow
you
know
you
do
want
to
learn
this
and
that
why
you
snailing
it
was
rather
a
trick
of
diavolo
to
snail
over
his
lessons
for
in
that
as
in
many
other
things
he
was
very
unlike
the
good
little
boy
who
loved
his
book
besides
evincing
many
other
traits
of
character
equally
unpopular
at
the
present
time
diavolo
would
not
work
unless
angelica
made
him
and
the
worst
collision
with
the
tutor
was
upon
this
subject
wake
up
theodore
will
you
ellis
said
during
the
first
week
of
their
studies
not
until
you
call
me
diavolo
was
the
bland
response
ellis
resisted
for
some
time
but
diavolo
was
firm
and
would
do
nothing
and
lady
adeline
cautioned
the
tutor
to
give
in
if
he
saw
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
with
dignity
but
the
young
scamp
will
be
jeeringly
triumphant
if
i
do
ellis
objected
oh
no
lady
adeline
answered
diavolo
prides
himself
upon
being
a
gentleman
and
he
says
a
gentleman
never
jeers
or
makes
himself
unpleasant
his
ideas
on
the
latter
point
by
the
way
are
peculiarly
his
own
and
you
will
probably
differ
from
him
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
unpleasant
ellis
made
a
point
of
calling
the
boy
diavolo
in
a
casual
way
as
if
he
had
forgotten
the
dispute
as
early
as
possible
after
this
and
found
that
lady
adeline
was
right
diavolo
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
having
heard
but
he
got
out
his
books
at
once
and
did
his
lessons
as
if
he
liked
them
had
a
habit
of
always
saying
a
little
more
than
was
necessary
on
some
subjects
he
was
either
a
born
or
had
never
conquered
the
problem
of
what
not
to
say
and
he
was
so
incautious
as
to
come
into
the
schoolroom
one
morning
while
lessons
were
going
on
and
warn
ellis
to
be
most
careful
about
what
he
gave
the
twins
to
read
in
latin
because
some
of
the
classic
delicacies
which
boys
are
expected
to
swallow
without
injury
to
themselves
are
much
too
highly
seasoned
for
a
young
lady
you
must
make
judicious
excerpts
he
said
slap
came
the
dictionary
down
upon
the
table
and
angelica
was
deep
in
the
ex
in
a
moment
excerpt
she
found
was
to
pick
or
take
out
she
passed
the
dictionary
to
diavolo
who
studied
the
definition
but
neither
of
them
made
a
remark
from
that
day
forth
however
they
spent
every
spare
moment
they
had
in
poring
over
latin
until
they
mastered
the
language
simply
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
what
it
was
that
angelica
ought
not
to
know
there
were
as
has
already
been
stated
some
lively
scenes
at
lessons
talk
less
and
do
more
ellis
rashly
recommended
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
and
after
that
when
they
disagreed
they
claimed
that
they
had
his
authority
to
settle
the
difference
by
tearing
each
hair
or
scratching
each
other
across
the
table
and
when
he
interfered
sometimes
they
scratched
him
too
raised
his
salary
eventually
the
children
invariably
had
a
discussion
about
everything
as
soon
as
it
was
over
they
called
it
talking
it
out
and
after
they
had
sinned
and
suffered
punishment
their
great
delight
was
to
come
and
coax
the
tutor
to
talk
it
out
they
would
then
criticize
their
own
conduct
and
his
impartially
point
out
what
they
might
have
done
and
what
he
might
have
done
and
what
ought
to
have
been
done
on
both
sides
these
discussions
usually
took
place
at
the
schoolroom
tea
a
meal
which
both
tutor
and
children
as
a
rule
thoroughly
enjoyed
ellis
was
not
bound
to
have
tea
with
the
twins
but
they
had
politely
invited
him
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
explaining
that
their
parents
were
out
and
it
would
give
them
great
pleasure
to
entertain
him
tea
being
ready
they
took
him
to
the
schoolroom
where
he
found
a
square
table
just
large
enough
for
four
daintily
decorated
with
flowers
and
very
nice
china
we
have
to
buy
our
own
china
because
we
break
so
much
angelica
said
seeing
that
the
tutor
noticed
it
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
papa
got
for
us
indicating
a
hugely
thick
white
cup
and
saucer
which
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
on
a
stand
of
royal
blue
plush
and
covered
with
a
glass
shade
we
broke
the
others
but
we
had
that
one
mounted
as
a
warning
to
him
papa
has
no
taste
at
all
the
tutor
face
was
a
study
it
was
the
first
of
these
remarks
he
had
heard
the
children
decided
that
it
would
balance
the
table
better
if
he
poured
out
the
tea
and
he
acquiesced
and
sat
down
with
angelica
on
his
right
and
diavolo
on
his
left
the
fourth
seat
opposite
was
unoccupied
but
there
was
a
cover
laid
and
he
asked
who
was
expected
oh
that
is
for
the
peace
angel
said
diavolo
casually
prevents
difficulties
at
tea
you
know
angelica
supplemented
do
mind
difficulties
but
we
thought
you
might
object
so
we
asked
his
holiness
indicating
the
empty
chair
to
preserve
order
ellis
did
not
at
first
appreciate
the
boon
which
was
conferred
on
him
by
the
presence
of
the
peace
angel
but
he
soon
learnt
to
i
am
on
my
honour
and
thick
bread
and
butter
said
diavolo
looking
longingly
at
the
plentiful
supply
and
variety
of
cakes
on
the
table
what
does
that
mean
exactly
ellis
asked
pausing
with
the
teapot
raised
to
pour
why
you
see
he
was
naughty
this
morning
angelica
explained
and
as
mamma
was
going
out
she
put
him
on
his
honour
as
a
punishment
not
to
eat
cake
i
a
good
mind
not
to
eat
anything
said
diavolo
considering
the
plate
of
thick
bread
and
butter
beside
him
discontentedly
then
you
be
cutting
off
your
nose
to
vex
your
face
said
angelica
diavolo
caught
up
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
to
throw
at
her
but
she
held
up
her
hand
crying
i
appeal
to
the
peace
angel
i
forgot
said
diavolo
transferring
the
bread
to
his
plate
the
children
studied
the
tutor
during
tea
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
somewhat
careworn
about
the
eyes
but
with
an
excessively
kind
and
pleasant
face
clean
shaven
and
thick
hair
he
was
above
the
middle
height
a
little
stooped
at
the
shoulders
but
of
average
strength
i
like
the
look
of
you
said
angelica
frankly
thank
you
he
answered
smiling
and
i
vote
for
a
permanent
arrangement
she
said
looking
at
diavolo
he
was
just
then
hidden
behind
a
huge
slice
of
bread
biting
it
but
he
nodded
intelligently
the
permanent
arrangement
referred
to
was
to
have
the
tutor
to
tea
and
he
agreed
wisely
stipulating
however
that
the
presence
of
the
peace
angel
should
also
be
permanent
he
even
tried
to
persuade
the
twins
to
invite
him
to
lessons
but
that
they
firmly
declined
you
like
being
our
tutor
i
think
diavolo
observed
during
this
first
tea
he
will
if
we
like
him
said
angelica
significantly
are
we
going
to
diavolo
asked
yes
i
think
so
she
answered
taking
another
good
look
at
ellis
i
like
the
look
of
that
red
in
his
hair
now
is
that
a
woman
reason
diavolo
exclaimed
appealing
to
ellis
yes
it
is
said
angelica
preparing
to
defend
it
by
shuffling
a
out
of
her
pocket
and
ruffling
the
leaves
over
listen
to
this
and
she
read
tinge
of
red
in
the
hair
denotes
strength
and
energy
of
character
and
good
staying
power
we
do
want
a
muff
for
a
tutor
do
we
there
are
born
muffs
enough
in
the
family
without
importing
them
and
a
woman
reason
is
always
a
good
one
as
men
might
see
if
they
only
stop
chattering
and
listen
to
it
it
may
be
well
expressed
but
it
will
bear
examination
ellis
suggested
do
you
like
being
a
tutor
diavolo
it
depends
on
whom
i
have
to
teach
if
you
a
good
fellow
you
have
a
nice
time
here
on
the
whole
i
hope
sir
angelica
observed
but
why
are
you
a
tutor
to
earn
my
living
ellis
answered
smiling
again
the
children
remembered
this
and
when
they
were
having
tea
under
the
shadow
of
the
supposititious
peace
angel
wing
after
the
first
occasion
on
which
when
the
tutor
tried
to
separate
them
during
a
fight
at
lessons
they
had
turned
simultaneously
and
attacked
him
they
made
it
the
text
of
some
recommendations
he
expressed
a
strong
objection
to
having
manual
labour
imposed
upon
him
as
well
as
his
other
work
but
they
maintained
that
if
only
he
had
called
the
affray
a
struggle
for
daily
bread
or
a
fight
for
a
livelihood
he
would
quite
have
enjoyed
it
and
they
further
suggested
that
such
diversion
must
be
much
more
interesting
than
being
a
mere
commonplace
tutor
who
only
taught
lessons
they
could
not
understand
why
a
fight
was
not
as
much
fun
for
him
as
for
them
and
thought
him
unreasonable
when
they
found
he
was
not
to
be
persuaded
to
countenance
that
way
of
varying
the
monotony
not
that
there
was
ever
much
monotony
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
heavenly
twins
they
managed
to
introduce
variety
into
everything
and
their
quickness
of
action
when
both
were
roused
was
phenomenal
one
day
while
at
work
they
saw
a
sparrow
pick
up
a
piece
of
bread
take
it
to
the
of
an
angle
of
the
house
visible
from
the
schoolroom
window
drop
it
and
chase
it
as
it
fell
and
the
twins
had
made
a
bet
as
to
which
would
beat
bird
or
bread
quarrelled
because
they
could
not
agree
as
to
which
had
bet
on
bird
and
which
on
bread
and
boxed
each
other
ears
almost
before
the
race
was
over
ellis
although
continually
upon
his
guard
was
not
by
any
means
always
a
match
for
them
over
and
over
again
he
found
that
his
caution
had
been
fanned
to
sleep
by
flattering
attentions
while
traps
were
being
laid
for
him
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
as
on
one
occasion
when
diavolo
betrayed
him
into
a
dissertation
on
the
consistency
of
the
scriptures
and
angelica
asked
him
to
kindly
show
her
how
to
reconcile
prov
viii
for
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
be
compared
to
it
with
eccles
i
for
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
his
way
with
them
was
admirable
however
and
he
completely
won
their
hearts
the
thing
that
they
respected
him
for
most
was
the
fact
that
he
took
in
on
his
own
account
and
could
show
you
a
lot
of
things
in
it
that
you
could
never
have
discovered
yourself
as
angelica
said
and
read
bits
in
a
way
that
made
them
seem
ever
so
much
funnier
than
when
read
them
and
could
tell
you
who
drew
the
pictures
the
moment
he
looked
at
them
so
that
day
came
to
be
looked
forward
to
by
the
children
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
events
of
the
week
lessons
were
suspended
the
moment
the
paper
arrived
if
they
had
been
good
but
when
they
were
naughty
ellis
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
and
that
was
the
greatest
punishment
he
could
inflict
upon
them
the
only
one
that
ever
made
them
sulk
they
would
be
good
for
hours
in
advance
to
earn
the
right
of
having
shown
to
them
the
moment
it
came
and
it
was
certainly
by
means
of
his
intelligent
interpretation
of
it
that
their
tutor
managed
to
cultivate
their
tastes
in
many
ways
and
give
them
true
ideas
of
art
and
the
importance
of
art
at
the
outset
and
also
of
ethics
he
was
as
careful
of
angelica
physical
as
of
her
mental
education
being
himself
strongly
imbued
by
the
then
new
idea
that
a
woman
should
have
the
full
use
of
her
limbs
lungs
heart
and
every
other
organ
and
muscle
so
that
life
might
be
a
pleasure
to
her
and
not
a
continual
exertion
he
had
a
strong
objection
to
the
artificial
waist
and
impressed
the
beauty
of
tenniel
classical
purity
of
figure
upon
the
children
by
teaching
them
to
appreciate
the
contrast
it
presents
to
the
bulging
vulgarities
made
manifest
by
keene
and
showed
them
also
that
while
du
maurier
depicted
with
admirable
artistic
interpretation
the
refined
surroundings
and
attenuated
forms
of
women
as
they
are
linley
sambourne
that
master
of
lovely
line
pointed
the
moral
by
drawing
women
as
they
should
be
there
was
nothing
conventional
about
the
heavenly
twins
and
it
was
therefore
easy
to
make
a
good
impression
upon
them
in
this
direction
and
the
tutor
soon
had
a
practical
proof
of
his
success
which
must
have
been
eminently
satisfactory
if
a
trifle
embarrassing
the
children
were
out
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
one
afternoon
when
a
lady
arrived
to
call
upon
their
mother
they
were
struck
by
her
appearance
as
she
descended
from
her
carriage
and
followed
her
into
the
drawing
room
to
have
a
good
look
at
her
she
was
one
of
those
heroic
women
who
have
the
constancy
to
squeeze
their
figures
in
beyond
the
y
shape
which
is
the
commonest
deformity
to
that
of
the
hourglass
which
bulges
out
more
above
and
below
the
line
of
compression
there
were
a
good
many
other
people
in
the
room
whom
the
heavenly
twins
saluted
politely
and
then
they
sat
down
opposite
to
the
object
of
their
interest
and
gazed
at
her
why
are
you
tied
so
tight
in
the
middle
angelica
asked
at
last
in
a
voice
that
silenced
everybody
else
in
the
room
does
it
hurt
i
mean
to
have
a
figure
when
i
grow
up
like
the
venus
de
medici
you
know
i
can
show
you
a
picture
of
her
if
you
like
she
has
a
stitch
on
her
she
looks
awfully
nice
though
said
diavolo
and
angelica
thinks
be
able
to
eat
more
with
that
kind
of
figure
yes
angelica
candidly
confessed
looking
at
her
victim
compassionately
i
should
think
now
that
you
can
eat
both
pudding
and
meat
can
you
not
to
mention
dessert
diavolo
ejaculated
with
genuine
concern
ellis
will
you
get
those
children
out
of
the
room
somehow
lady
adeline
whispered
to
the
tutor
who
had
come
in
for
tea
is
it
true
do
you
think
ellis
began
loudly
addressing
across
the
room
is
it
true
that
galbraith
is
going
to
try
some
horrible
experiments
in
vivisection
this
afternoon
what
is
vivisection
asked
angelica
diverted
cutting
up
live
animals
to
find
out
what
makes
them
go
said
the
tutor
in
three
minutes
there
was
a
vestige
of
the
heavenly
twins
about
the
place
chapter
xx
the
twins
had
a
code
of
ethics
which
differed
in
some
respects
from
that
ordinarily
accepted
in
their
state
of
life
they
honoured
their
mother
they
could
help
it
as
they
said
themselves
apologetically
but
their
father
they
looked
upon
as
fair
game
for
their
amusement
what
was
that
unearthly
noise
i
heard
this
morning
ellis
asked
one
day
oh
did
we
wake
you
sir
diavolo
exclaimed
we
did
mean
to
we
were
only
yowling
papa
out
of
bed
with
our
fiddles
he
idle
sometimes
and
wo
get
up
and
it
so
bad
for
him
you
know
i
wish
you
could
see
him
scooting
down
the
corridor
after
us
angelica
observed
and
do
you
know
he
speaks
just
the
same
at
that
time
of
day
in
his
dressing
gown
as
he
does
in
the
evening
in
dress
clothes
you
die
if
you
heard
him
another
habit
of
the
twins
was
to
read
any
letters
they
might
find
lying
about
it
is
dishonourable
to
read
other
people
letters
ellis
admonished
them
severely
when
he
became
aware
of
this
peculiarity
it
is
for
us
angelica
answered
defiantly
you
might
as
well
say
its
dishonourable
to
squint
we
always
done
it
and
everybody
knows
we
do
it
we
warn
them
not
to
leave
their
letters
lying
about
do
we
diavolo
that
is
because
it
is
greater
fun
to
hunt
for
them
diavolo
interpreted
precisely
when
angelica
gave
a
reason
he
usually
cleared
it
of
all
obscurity
in
this
way
and
how
are
we
to
know
what
goes
on
in
the
family
if
we
do
read
the
letters
angelica
demanded
what
necessity
is
there
for
you
to
know
every
necessity
she
retorted
not
be
interested
in
one
own
family
affairs
why
we
should
we
wanting
in
intelligence
and
we
not
that
you
know
and
we
should
be
wanting
in
affection
too
and
every
right
feeling
and
i
hope
we
are
not
that
either
ellis
but
you
need
be
afraid
about
your
own
letters
we
sha
touch
them
no
drawled
diavolo
of
course
that
would
be
a
very
different
thing
i
am
glad
you
draw
the
line
somewhere
ellis
observed
sarcastically
he
was
far
from
satisfied
however
but
he
noticed
eventually
that
the
dust
collected
on
letters
of
his
own
if
he
left
them
lying
about
and
he
soon
discovered
that
when
his
intelligent
pupils
gave
their
word
they
kept
it
uncompromisingly
it
was
one
of
their
virtues
and
the
other
was
loyalty
to
each
other
their
devotion
to
their
mother
hardly
counted
for
a
virtue
because
they
never
carried
it
far
enough
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
her
sake
but
they
would
have
sacrificed
their
very
lives
for
each
other
and
would
have
fought
for
the
right
to
die
until
there
was
very
little
left
of
either
of
them
to
execute
of
such
peculiar
quality
were
their
affections
they
had
gone
straight
to
fountain
towers
by
the
shortest
cut
across
the
fields
that
afternoon
when
ellis
suggested
vivisection
as
a
possible
occupation
for
galbraith
they
never
doubted
but
that
they
should
discover
him
hard
at
work
in
some
underground
cellar
most
likely
to
which
they
would
be
guided
by
the
cries
of
his
victims
and
would
be
able
to
conquer
his
reluctance
to
allow
them
to
assist
at
his
experiments
by
threats
of
exposure
and
they
were
considerably
chagrined
when
having
carefully
concealed
themselves
in
a
thick
shrubbery
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
house
they
came
upon
him
in
the
garden
innocently
occupied
in
the
idle
pursuit
of
pruning
rose
trees
he
was
somewhat
startled
himself
when
he
suddenly
saw
their
hot
red
faces
set
like
two
moons
in
a
clump
of
greenery
peeping
out
at
him
with
animated
eyes
hollo
he
said
are
you
hungry
the
faces
disappeared
behind
the
bushes
are
we
angelica
diavolo
whispered
anxiously
of
course
we
are
she
retorted
i
thought
we
were
too
angry
disgusted
disappointed
he
murmured
apologetically
but
evidently
much
relieved
galbraith
went
on
with
his
pruning
and
presently
the
twins
appeared
walking
down
the
proper
approach
to
the
garden
hand
in
hand
demurely
after
they
had
saluted
their
host
politely
they
stood
and
stared
at
him
well
he
said
at
last
i
suppose
we
are
too
late
said
angelica
for
what
he
asked
without
pausing
in
his
occupation
for
the
vivinesectionining
what
on
earth
oh
light
broke
in
upon
him
who
told
you
i
was
ellis
said
angelica
no
he
did
tell
us
you
were
exactly
diavolo
explained
with
conscientious
accuracy
he
asked
papa
if
it
was
true
that
you
were
going
to
this
afternoon
and
what
were
doing
galbraith
asked
astutely
we
were
in
the
drawing
room
angelica
answered
trying
to
find
out
from
a
lady
why
she
tied
herself
up
so
tight
in
the
middle
and
so
you
came
off
here
to
see
yes
said
diavolo
we
wanted
to
catch
you
at
it
you
little
brute
misbegotten
by
the
galbraith
began
but
diavolo
interrupted
him
he
exclaimed
drawing
himself
up
with
an
expression
of
as
much
indignation
as
could
be
got
into
his
small
patrician
features
if
you
do
not
instantly
withdraw
that
calumny
i
shall
have
to
fight
you
on
my
mother
behalf
and
i
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
inform
her
of
the
insinuation
which
is
the
cause
of
offence
i
apologize
said
galbraith
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
low
i
assure
you
the
expression
was
used
as
a
mere
de
i
accept
your
explanation
sir
said
diavolo
returning
the
salute
but
i
caution
you
to
be
careful
for
the
future
what
is
a
de
angelica
he
whispered
as
he
put
his
hat
on
oh
just
a
way
of
saying
it
she
answered
i
wish
you
would
talk
so
much
men
are
always
cackling
by
the
hour
all
about
nothing
if
people
come
to
see
me
when
have
a
house
of
my
own
i
shall
not
forget
the
rites
of
hospitality
the
doctor
put
up
his
pruning
knife
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
gray
eyes
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
come
this
way
he
said
my
slaves
will
prepare
a
small
collation
on
the
instant
oh
yes
said
diavolo
arabian
nights
you
know
you
must
have
fresh
fruits
and
dried
fruits
choice
wines
cakes
sweets
and
nuts
it
shall
be
done
as
my
lord
commands
said
the
doctor
that
same
evening
when
he
took
the
children
home
galbraith
found
lady
adeline
alone
she
was
a
plain
woman
but
in
appearance
and
tender
thoughts
had
carved
a
sweet
expression
on
her
face
next
to
her
brother
dawne
dawne
most
intimate
friend
galbraith
was
the
man
in
the
world
upon
whom
she
placed
the
greatest
reliance
i
have
brought
back
the
children
he
said
ah
then
they
been
with
you
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
relief
we
hoped
they
were
oh
yes
he
said
smiling
they
showed
me
exactly
what
the
difficulty
here
had
been
and
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
win
back
their
esteem
for
they
made
it
appear
plainly
that
they
despised
me
when
they
found
me
peacefully
pruning
rose
trees
instead
of
dismembering
live
rabbits
as
ellis
had
apparently
led
them
to
expect
they
told
you
then
oh
exactly
i
am
sure
about
the
lady
tied
too
tight
in
the
middle
and
everything
they
are
terrible
george
those
children
lady
adeline
declared
my
whole
life
is
one
ache
of
anxiety
on
their
account
i
am
always
in
doubt
as
to
whether
their
unnatural
acuteness
portends
vice
or
is
promising
and
whether
we
are
doing
all
that
ought
to
be
done
for
them
i
am
sure
they
are
in
very
good
hands
now
he
answered
cheerfully
ellis
is
an
exceedingly
good
fellow
they
like
him
too
and
i
do
think
anybody
could
manage
them
better
no
said
lady
adeline
but
that
only
means
that
no
one
can
manage
them
at
all
they
are
everywhere
they
know
everything
they
have
already
mastered
every
fact
in
natural
history
that
can
be
learnt
upon
the
estate
and
they
will
do
almost
anything
and
are
so
unscrupulous
that
i
fear
sometimes
they
are
going
to
take
after
some
criminal
ancestor
there
may
have
been
in
the
family
although
i
never
heard
of
one
and
go
to
the
bad
altogether
now
what
is
to
be
done
with
such
children
i
hardly
dare
allow
myself
to
hope
that
they
have
good
qualities
enough
to
save
them
and
yet
and
yet
they
are
lovable
she
added
looking
at
him
wistfully
most
lovable
and
i
am
sure
you
need
not
disturb
yourself
seriously
he
answered
with
confidence
the
children
have
vivid
imaginations
and
incomparable
courage
and
their
love
of
mischief
comes
from
exuberance
of
spirits
only
i
am
sure
when
angelica
womanly
instincts
develop
and
she
has
seen
something
of
the
serious
side
of
life
been
made
to
it
i
mean
she
will
become
a
very
different
person
or
i
am
much
mistaken
her
character
promises
to
be
as
fine
when
it
is
formed
as
it
will
certainly
be
unusual
and
as
for
diavolo
well
i
have
seen
no
sign
of
any
positive
vice
in
either
of
them
you
comfort
me
said
lady
adeline
how
did
you
entertain
them
oh
we
had
great
fun
he
replied
laughing
we
had
an
impromptu
arabian
night
entertainment
with
all
the
men
and
women
about
the
place
disguised
as
slaves
and
they
all
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
heartily
i
assure
you
i
never
enjoyed
anything
more
in
my
life
but
i
must
go
i
am
on
my
way
to
town
to
read
a
paper
morning
upon
a
most
interesting
case
of
retarded
brain
development
which
i
have
been
studying
for
the
last
year
if
i
am
right
in
my
conclusions
we
are
upon
the
high
road
to
some
extraordinary
and
most
valuable
discoveries
now
that
is
a
singular
man
lady
adeline
remarked
to
ellis
afterward
she
had
been
telling
the
tutor
about
the
success
of
his
stratagem
he
spent
valuable
hours
playing
with
my
children
and
he
says
he
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
his
life
and
i
quite
believe
him
and
he
will
probably
astonish
the
scientific
world
with
a
discovery
of
the
last
importance
i
call
him
a
human
being
perfectly
possessed
of
all
his
faculties
ellis
answered
the
twins
worked
well
by
fits
and
starts
but
when
they
did
not
chose
to
be
diligent
they
considerately
gave
their
tutor
a
holiday
the
last
threat
of
a
thrashing
for
diavolo
happened
to
be
on
the
first
of
these
occasions
it
looks
a
good
morning
for
fishing
he
remarked
casually
to
angelica
just
after
they
had
settled
down
to
lessons
yes
it
does
she
answered
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
then
away
went
their
books
and
they
were
off
out
of
the
window
but
ellis
succeeded
in
capturing
them
and
laying
hold
of
an
arm
of
each
he
dragged
them
before
the
paternal
tribunal
in
the
library
he
was
not
intimate
with
the
peculiar
relations
of
the
household
to
each
other
at
that
particular
time
and
he
thought
would
prefer
to
order
the
punishment
himself
for
so
serious
an
offence
angelica
shook
her
hair
over
her
face
and
made
sufficient
feint
of
resistance
to
tumble
her
frock
on
the
way
while
diavolo
pretended
to
be
but
this
was
only
to
please
ellis
with
the
delusion
that
fear
of
their
father
gave
him
a
moral
hold
over
them
for
the
moment
frowned
upon
them
they
straightened
themselves
and
beamed
about
blandly
ordered
diavolo
to
be
thrashed
and
diavolo
dashed
off
for
the
cane
and
handed
it
to
his
tutor
politely
saying
at
the
same
time
do
be
quick
ellis
i
want
to
get
out
you
would
dare
to
thrash
him
if
he
were
big
enough
to
thrash
you
back
angelica
shrieked
waltzing
round
like
a
tornado
and
it
fair
to
thrash
him
and
not
me
for
i
am
much
worse
than
he
is
you
know
i
am
papa
and
i
shall
you
if
diavolo
is
thrashed
and
teach
him
how
to
make
your
life
a
burden
to
you
for
a
month
i
stamping
her
foot
it
always
made
her
blood
boil
if
there
were
any
question
of
corporal
punishment
for
diavolo
she
could
have
endured
it
herself
without
a
murmur
but
she
had
a
feminine
objection
to
knowing
that
it
was
being
inflicted
especially
as
she
was
not
allowed
to
be
present
do
be
an
idiot
angelica
diavolo
drawled
i
would
rather
be
thrashed
and
have
done
with
it
it
does
fellows
good
to
be
thrashed
makes
them
manly
they
say
in
the
books
and
it
hurts
a
jolly
sight
less
than
being
scratched
by
if
that
is
any
comfort
oh
you
mean
angelica
exclaimed
wait
till
we
get
outside
i
think
sir
ellis
ventured
to
suggest
in
answer
to
an
appealing
glance
from
and
looking
dubiously
at
the
cane
i
think
since
diavolo
does
care
a
rap
about
being
flogged
i
had
better
devise
a
form
of
punishment
for
which
he
will
care
then
come
along
diavolo
angelica
exclaimed
making
a
dash
for
the
door
they
wo
want
us
while
they
devising
ellis
would
have
followed
them
but
gently
restrained
him
it
is
no
use
ellis
he
said
sighing
deeply
i
would
recommend
you
to
keep
up
a
show
of
disapproval
for
form
sake
but
i
beg
that
you
will
not
give
yourself
any
unnecessary
trouble
they
are
quite
incorrigible
i
hope
not
the
tutor
answered
well
i
leave
them
to
you
make
what
you
can
of
them
their
father
rejoined
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
responsibility
while
you
are
here
the
heavenly
twins
got
their
day
sport
on
that
occasion
and
returned
with
a
basket
full
of
trout
for
tea
fishy
themselves
and
tired
but
bland
and
conciliatory
they
dressed
for
the
evening
carefully
and
without
coercion
which
was
always
a
sign
of
repentance
and
then
they
went
down
to
the
schoolroom
where
they
found
ellis
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
reading
a
newspaper
he
looked
at
them
each
in
turn
as
they
entered
and
they
looked
at
him
but
he
made
no
remark
i
wish
you
would
give
us
a
good
scolding
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
angelica
observed
he
made
no
sign
of
having
heard
however
but
quietly
turned
the
paper
over
chose
a
fresh
item
of
information
and
began
to
read
it
angelica
sat
down
in
her
place
at
table
leant
back
with
her
short
frock
up
to
her
knees
and
her
long
legs
tucked
under
her
chair
and
reflected
diavolo
did
the
same
yawning
aggressively
i
sell
my
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
with
pleasure
this
minute
he
exclaimed
what
was
pottage
mr
ellis
angelica
asked
insinuatingly
you
do
suppose
the
recipe
has
been
handed
down
in
the
ellis
family
do
you
said
diavolo
angelica
looked
round
for
a
missile
to
hurl
at
him
but
there
being
nothing
handy
she
tried
the
effect
of
a
withering
glance
to
which
he
responded
by
making
a
face
at
her
a
storm
was
evidently
brewing
but
fortunately
just
at
that
moment
the
tea
arrived
and
caused
a
diversion
which
prevented
further
demonstrations
happily
for
those
in
charge
of
the
twins
their
outbursts
of
feeling
were
all
squalls
which
subsided
as
suddenly
as
those
of
the
innocent
babe
which
howls
everybody
in
the
house
out
of
bed
for
his
bottle
and
is
beyond
all
comfort
till
he
gets
it
when
his
anger
instantly
goes
out
and
only
a
few
gurgling
oh
of
intense
satisfaction
mark
the
point
from
which
the
racket
proceeded
for
a
week
ellis
maintained
an
attitude
of
dignified
reserve
with
the
twins
and
their
sociable
souls
were
much
exercised
to
devise
a
means
to
break
down
the
barrier
of
coldness
which
they
found
between
themselves
and
their
tutor
they
tried
everything
they
could
think
of
to
beguile
him
back
to
the
old
friendly
footing
and
it
was
only
after
all
other
means
had
failed
that
they
thought
at
last
of
apologising
for
their
unruly
conduct
it
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
in
their
lives
spontaneously
and
they
were
so
proud
of
it
that
they
went
and
told
everybody
they
knew
ellis
having
graciously
accepted
the
apology
found
himself
expected
to
discuss
the
whole
subject
at
tea
that
evening
of
course
we
were
quite
in
the
wrong
said
angelica
taking
advantage
of
the
peace
angel
presence
to
sum
up
comprehensively
but
you
must
acknowledge
that
we
were
not
altogether
to
blame
for
you
really
have
not
been
making
our
lessons
sufficiently
interesting
to
rivet
our
attention
lately
that
is
true
said
the
diligent
diavolo
my
attention
has
not
been
riveted
for
weeks
after
the
twins
had
made
their
memorable
apology
they
were
so
impressed
by
the
importance
of
the
event
that
they
determined
to
celebrate
it
in
some
special
way
they
wanted
to
do
something
really
worthy
of
the
occasion
we
do
some
good
to
somebody
shall
we
said
angelica
not
unless
there
some
fun
in
it
said
diavolo
well
who
proposed
to
do
anything
without
fun
in
it
angelica
wanted
to
know
you
no
sense
at
all
diavolo
when
people
get
up
fancy
fairs
and
charity
balls
do
they
pretend
to
be
doing
it
for
fun
no
they
say
my
dear
i
so
busy
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
first
but
what
keeps
me
up
is
the
object
the
good
object
and
then
they
enjoying
it
as
hard
as
they
can
all
the
time
and
that
what
we
do
we
give
the
school
children
a
treat
the
twins
were
allowed
an
hour
to
riot
about
the
place
after
their
early
dinner
and
then
a
bell
was
rung
to
summon
them
in
to
lessons
but
on
that
particular
day
ellis
waited
in
vain
for
them
angelica
had
concealed
her
riding
habit
in
a
loft
and
as
soon
as
they
got
out
they
ran
to
the
stables
which
were
just
then
deserted
the
men
being
at
their
dinner
and
angelica
changed
her
dress
while
diavolo
got
out
their
ponies
and
saddled
them
and
having
carefully
stolen
through
a
thick
plantation
on
to
the
high
road
they
scampered
off
to
morningquest
as
hard
as
their
lively
little
steeds
could
carry
them
they
were
well
known
in
morningquest
and
many
an
admiring
as
well
as
inquiring
glance
followed
them
as
they
cantered
close
together
side
by
side
through
the
quaint
old
streets
the
people
were
wondering
what
on
earth
they
were
up
to
everybody
looks
so
pleased
to
see
us
said
diavolo
smiling
genially
i
think
we
ought
to
come
oftener
we
will
said
angelica
they
pulled
up
at
the
principal
confectioner
in
the
place
and
bought
as
many
pounds
of
sweets
as
they
could
carry
desiring
the
proprietor
in
a
lordly
way
to
send
the
bill
to
hamilton
house
at
his
earliest
convenience
and
then
they
rode
off
to
the
largest
day
school
in
the
city
stationed
themselves
on
either
side
of
a
narrow
gateway
through
which
both
girls
and
boys
had
to
pass
to
get
in
and
pelted
the
children
with
sweets
as
they
returned
from
their
midday
dinners
and
as
they
had
chosen
sugar
almonds
birds
eggs
and
other
varieties
of
a
hard
and
heavy
nature
which
although
interesting
in
the
mouth
of
a
child
are
inconvenient
when
received
in
its
eyes
and
cause
irritation
which
is
apt
to
be
resented
when
pelted
at
the
back
of
its
head
the
scene
in
a
few
minutes
was
extremely
animated
this
was
what
the
heavenly
twins
called
giving
the
school
children
a
treat
and
they
told
ellis
afterward
that
they
enjoyed
doing
good
very
much
what
shall
we
do
now
said
diavolo
as
they
walked
their
ponies
aimlessly
down
the
street
when
that
episode
was
over
let
call
on
grandpapa
and
the
bishop
angelica
suggested
the
bishop
first
then
said
diavolo
they
such
good
cakes
at
the
palace
well
that
just
why
we
should
do
grandpapa
first
said
angelica
do
you
see
we
can
have
cake
at
morne
and
we
shall
be
able
to
eat
the
ones
at
the
palace
too
if
they
better
yes
said
diavolo
with
grave
precision
i
notice
myself
that
however
much
i
have
had
i
can
always
eat
a
little
more
of
something
better
that
what
they
mean
by
tempting
the
appetite
observed
angelica
sagely
when
the
children
arrived
at
the
castle
it
occurred
to
them
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
idea
to
ride
right
in
and
go
upstairs
on
their
ponies
but
they
only
succeeded
in
mounting
the
broad
steps
and
entering
the
hall
where
they
were
captured
by
the
footmen
and
respectfully
persuaded
to
alight
they
announced
that
they
had
come
to
call
on
the
duke
of
morningquest
and
were
conducted
to
his
presence
with
pomp
and
ceremony
enough
to
have
embarrassed
any
other
equally
dusty
dishevelled
mortals
but
the
twins
were
not
troubled
with
and
entered
with
perfect
confidence
the
duke
was
delighted
if
there
was
one
thing
which
could
give
him
more
pleasure
than
another
in
his
old
age
it
was
the
wicked
ways
of
the
heavenly
twins
and
especially
of
the
promising
angelica
who
very
much
resembled
him
both
in
appearance
decision
of
character
and
sharpness
of
temper
she
promised
however
to
be
on
a
much
larger
scale
for
the
duke
was
diminutive
he
looked
like
one
who
stands
in
a
picture
at
the
end
of
a
long
line
of
ancestors
considerably
reduced
by
the
perspective
and
it
was
as
if
in
his
person
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
breed
the
race
down
to
the
vanishing
point
his
feet
were
admired
as
models
of
size
and
shape
and
so
also
were
his
slender
delicate
hands
but
neither
were
agreeable
to
an
educated
eye
and
an
intelligence
indifferent
to
the
dignity
of
dukes
but
nice
in
the
matter
of
proportion
the
children
found
their
grandfather
in
the
oriel
room
so
called
because
of
the
great
oriel
window
which
was
a
small
room
in
itself
although
it
looked
as
you
approached
the
castle
no
bigger
than
a
swallow
nest
on
the
face
of
the
solid
masonry
being
the
only
excrescence
visible
above
the
trees
from
that
point
of
view
the
castle
stood
on
a
hill
which
descended
precipitously
from
under
the
oriel
so
that
the
latter
almost
overhung
the
valley
in
which
the
city
lay
below
and
commanded
a
magnificent
view
of
the
flat
country
beyond
thridded
by
a
shining
winding
ribbon
of
river
the
hill
was
wooded
on
that
side
to
the
top
and
the
castle
crowned
it
rising
above
the
trees
in
irregular
outline
against
the
sky
imposingly
the
old
duke
sat
in
the
oriel
often
looking
down
at
the
wonderful
prospect
but
thinking
less
of
his
own
vast
possessions
than
of
the
great
cathedral
of
morningquest
which
he
coveted
for
holy
church
he
had
become
a
convert
to
roman
catholicism
in
his
old
age
and
his
bigotry
and
credulity
were
as
great
now
as
his
laxity
and
scepticism
had
been
before
his
conversion
he
was
sitting
alone
with
his
confessor
and
private
chaplain
father
ricardo
a
man
of
middle
age
middle
height
attenuated
form
round
head
with
coarse
black
hair
piercing
dark
eyes
aquiline
nose
somewhat
thick
and
the
loose
mouth
characteristic
of
devout
roman
catholics
high
church
people
and
others
who
are
continually
being
wound
up
to
worship
an
unseen
deity
by
means
of
sensuous
enjoyment
the
uncertain
lines
into
which
the
lips
fall
in
repose
indicating
fairly
the
habitual
extent
of
their
emotional
indulgences
his
manners
were
suave
and
deferential
his
motives
sincerely
disinterested
in
the
interests
of
the
church
his
method
of
gaining
his
ends
unhampered
by
any
sense
of
the
need
of
extreme
verbal
accuracy
he
was
reading
to
the
duke
when
the
children
were
announced
and
rose
and
bowed
low
to
them
as
they
entered
with
a
smile
of
respectful
and
affectionate
interest
diavolo
raised
his
dusty
cap
to
his
chest
and
returned
the
bow
with
punctilious
gravity
angelica
tossed
him
a
nod
as
she
passed
up
the
room
in
a
way
to
where
her
grandfather
was
sitting
facing
the
window
the
old
duke
looked
round
as
the
children
approached
and
his
face
relaxed
he
did
not
absolutely
smile
but
his
eyes
twinkled
angelica
plumped
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
deposited
a
superficial
kiss
somewhere
in
the
region
of
his
ear
while
diavolo
wrung
his
hand
more
ceremoniously
but
with
much
energy
both
children
seemed
sure
of
their
welcome
and
comported
themselves
with
their
usual
unaffected
ease
of
manner
the
old
duke
controlled
his
mouth
but
there
was
something
in
the
expression
of
his
countenance
which
meant
that
he
would
have
chuckled
if
his
old
sense
of
humour
had
not
been
checked
by
the
presence
of
the
priest
which
held
him
somehow
to
his
new
professions
of
faith
and
the
severe
dignity
of
demeanour
that
best
befits
the
piety
of
a
professional
saint
he
was
wearing
a
little
black
velvet
skull
cap
and
angelica
still
sitting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
took
it
off
as
soon
as
she
had
saluted
him
looked
into
it
and
clapped
it
on
to
the
back
of
his
head
again
somewhat
awry
i
am
glad
you
have
your
black
velvet
coat
on
she
said
embracing
the
back
of
his
chair
with
an
arm
and
kicking
her
long
legs
about
in
her
fidgety
way
it
goes
well
with
your
hair
and
i
like
the
feel
of
it
have
you
a
holiday
the
duke
demanded
with
an
affectation
of
sternness
yes
said
angelica
absently
taking
up
one
of
his
delicate
hands
and
transferring
a
costly
ring
from
his
slender
white
forefinger
to
her
own
dirty
brown
one
no
the
more
exact
diavolo
contradicted
we
gave
ellis
a
holiday
to
tell
you
the
truth
grandpapa
i
had
forgotten
all
about
lessons
said
angelica
candidly
i
fancy
ellis
is
fizzing
by
this
time
you
diavolo
what
are
you
doing
here
if
you
have
a
holiday
their
grandfather
asked
visiting
you
sir
diavolo
answered
in
his
peculiar
drawl
which
always
left
you
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
intended
an
impertinence
or
not
he
was
lying
at
full
length
on
the
floor
facing
his
grandfather
with
the
back
of
his
head
resting
on
the
low
window
sill
and
the
old
gentleman
was
looking
at
him
admiringly
he
was
not
at
all
sure
of
the
import
of
diavolo
last
reply
but
had
the
tact
not
to
pursue
the
subject
the
priest
had
remained
standing
with
his
hands
folded
upon
the
book
he
had
been
reading
and
a
set
smile
upon
his
thin
intellectual
face
behind
which
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
busy
thoughts
came
crowding
angelica
turned
on
him
suddenly
flinging
herself
from
the
arm
of
her
grandfather
chair
on
to
a
low
seat
which
stood
with
its
back
to
the
window
in
order
to
do
so
i
say
papa
ricardo
i
want
to
ask
you
she
began
what
do
you
think
of
that
baronne
de
chantal
whom
you
call
sainte
when
her
son
threw
himself
across
the
threshold
of
their
home
to
prevent
her
leaving
the
house
and
she
stepped
across
his
body
to
go
and
be
it
was
the
heroic
act
of
a
holy
woman
the
priest
replied
but
i
thought
home
was
the
woman
sphere
said
angelica
yes
the
priest
rejoined
unless
god
calls
them
to
religion
but
did
god
give
her
all
those
children
angelica
pursued
yes
indeed
said
father
ricardo
children
are
the
gift
of
god
well
so
i
thought
i
had
heard
angelica
remarked
with
a
genial
air
of
being
much
interested
but
it
seems
such
bad
management
to
give
a
lady
a
lot
of
children
and
then
take
her
away
so
that
she
ca
look
after
them
the
poor
old
duke
had
been
dull
all
day
his
mind
under
the
influence
of
his
father
confessor
had
been
running
on
the
horrors
of
hell
and
such
subjects
together
with
the
necessity
of
accomplishing
certain
good
works
and
setting
aside
large
sums
of
money
in
order
to
excuse
himself
from
such
condemnation
as
the
priest
had
ventured
to
hint
courteously
that
even
a
great
duke
might
entail
upon
himself
by
the
quite
excusable
errors
of
his
youth
but
since
the
heavenly
twins
arrived
the
old
gentleman
had
begun
to
see
things
again
from
a
point
of
view
more
natural
to
one
of
his
family
and
his
countenance
cleared
in
a
way
which
denoted
that
his
spirits
were
rising
father
ricardo
was
accustomed
to
say
that
the
dear
children
high
spirits
were
apt
to
be
too
much
for
his
grace
but
this
was
a
mistake
due
doubtless
to
his
extreme
humility
which
would
not
allow
him
to
mention
himself
for
whom
there
was
no
doubt
the
dear
children
apt
to
be
too
much
the
old
duke
upon
that
last
remark
of
angelica
twinkled
a
glance
at
his
father
confessor
which
had
an
effect
on
the
latter
that
made
itself
apparent
in
the
severity
of
his
reply
the
ways
of
the
lord
are
inscrutable
he
said
and
it
is
presumptuous
for
mortals
however
great
their
station
to
attempt
to
fathom
them
i
have
heard
that
before
too
often
said
diavolo
with
a
wise
nod
of
commendation
so
have
i
said
angelica
and
then
both
children
beamed
at
the
priest
cordially
and
the
chuckle
escaped
from
the
duke
father
ricardo
retired
into
himself
grandpapa
diavolo
resumed
the
heavenly
twins
never
allowed
the
conversation
to
flag
grandpapa
do
you
believe
there
ever
was
a
little
boy
who
never
never
told
a
lie
i
hope
sir
you
do
not
mean
me
to
infer
that
you
are
mendacious
the
old
gentleman
sternly
rejoined
mendacious
diavolo
repeated
that
do
i
tell
lies
is
it
well
you
see
sir
it
like
this
if
i
been
up
to
something
and
you
asked
me
if
i
done
it
i
say
like
a
shot
but
if
angelica
had
been
up
to
something
and
i
knew
all
about
it
and
you
asked
me
if
she
done
it
i
say
flatly
do
i
understand
sir
that
you
would
tell
me
a
lie
yes
said
diavolo
decidedly
if
you
were
mean
enough
to
expect
me
to
sneak
on
angelica
father
ricardo
the
latter
began
energetically
when
you
tell
a
lie
do
you
look
straight
at
a
person
or
just
past
the
side
of
their
heads
always
look
straight
at
a
person
myself
said
diavolo
gravely
considering
the
priest
i
ca
help
it
it
the
best
way
said
angelica
with
the
assurance
of
one
who
has
tried
both
i
suppose
grandpapa
she
pursued
when
people
get
old
they
have
nothing
to
tell
lies
about
they
just
sit
and
listen
to
them
and
again
she
looked
hard
at
father
ricardo
whose
face
had
gradually
become
suffused
with
an
angry
red
i
should
think
father
ricardo
said
diavolo
observing
this
if
you
were
a
layman
you
would
be
feeling
now
as
if
you
could
throttle
us
but
before
the
poor
priest
could
utter
the
reproof
which
trembled
on
his
lips
the
door
opened
and
the
duke
unmarried
daughter
and
youngest
child
the
beautiful
lady
fulda
entered
and
changed
the
moral
atmosphere
in
a
moment
both
children
rose
to
receive
her
tender
kisses
affectionately
their
passionate
appreciation
of
all
things
beautiful
betrayed
itself
in
the
way
they
gazed
at
her
and
hers
was
the
only
presence
that
ever
subdued
them
for
a
moment
i
like
her
in
white
and
gold
angelica
remarked
to
diavolo
when
she
had
looked
her
longest
so
do
i
diavolo
rejoined
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
my
dear
children
lady
fulda
exclaimed
you
must
not
discuss
my
appearance
in
that
way
you
speak
of
me
as
if
i
were
not
here
you
never
seem
to
be
here
somehow
said
diavolo
struggling
with
a
big
thought
he
could
not
express
i
always
feel
when
you
come
in
as
if
you
were
miles
and
miles
away
from
us
now
mamma
is
always
close
to
us
and
papa
gets
quite
in
the
way
but
you
seem
to
be
he
raised
both
hands
high
above
his
head
with
the
palms
spread
outward
and
then
let
his
arms
sink
to
his
sides
slowly
the
gesture
expressed
an
immeasurable
distance
above
and
beyond
him
yes
said
angelica
i
feel
that
too
but
sometimes
when
there
music
and
flowers
and
no
light
to
speak
of
in
church
you
know
and
you
feel
as
if
angels
might
be
about
or
even
the
lord
himself
i
rise
up
beside
you
somehow
and
come
quite
close
lady
fulda
eyes
deepened
with
feeling
as
angelica
spoke
and
drawing
the
child
to
her
side
she
smoothed
her
hair
and
gazed
down
into
her
face
earnestly
as
if
she
would
penetrate
the
veil
of
flesh
that
baffled
her
when
she
tried
to
see
clearly
the
soul
of
which
angelica
occasionally
gave
her
some
such
glimpse
the
old
duke
glanced
round
at
the
clock
and
instantly
the
attentive
priest
stepped
to
the
window
and
opened
it
wide
then
the
duke
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
enjoin
silence
and
presently
the
music
of
the
bells
of
the
city
clocks
striking
the
hour
in
various
tones
and
all
at
different
moments
causing
a
continuous
murmurous
sea
of
sound
arose
from
below
when
the
last
vibration
ceased
there
was
a
quite
perceptible
pause
the
duke
took
off
his
little
round
black
velvet
cap
and
leant
forward
listening
intently
lady
fulda
bent
her
head
and
her
lips
moved
the
priest
folded
his
hands
and
looked
straight
before
him
with
the
unconscious
eyes
of
one
absorbed
in
thought
or
prayer
who
sees
not
the
twins
assuming
a
sanctimonious
expression
bowed
their
hypocritical
heads
and
watched
what
was
going
on
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
there
was
a
moment
interval
and
then
came
the
chime
mellowed
by
distance
but
clear
and
resonant
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
it
was
the
habit
of
the
old
duke
to
listen
for
it
hour
by
hour
and
while
it
rang
he
and
those
of
his
household
who
shared
his
faith
offered
a
fervent
prayer
for
the
restoration
of
holy
church
lady
fulda
insisted
on
sending
the
children
home
under
proper
escort
they
strongly
objected
they
said
they
were
not
going
straight
home
they
had
to
call
on
the
bishop
of
morningquest
why
are
you
going
to
call
on
the
bishop
of
morningquest
their
aunt
asked
we
wish
to
see
him
angelica
answered
stiffly
on
the
subject
of
rotten
potatoes
diavolo
supplemented
lady
fulda
stared
sainte
chantal
you
know
said
the
ready
angelica
the
reason
was
new
to
her
but
the
twins
usually
understood
each
other
like
a
flash
they
put
a
rotten
potato
on
her
plate
one
day
at
dinner
and
she
ate
it
she
was
so
hungry
suggested
lady
fulda
trying
hard
to
remember
the
story
no
so
humble
angelica
answered
at
least
so
they
say
in
the
book
but
we
do
think
it
could
have
been
humility
it
must
have
been
horrid
bad
taste
but
we
going
to
ask
the
bishop
he
so
temperate
you
know
we
tried
to
discuss
the
matter
with
father
ricardo
but
he
shut
us
up
promptly
my
dear
child
lady
fulda
exclaimed
what
an
expression
i
assure
you
it
is
the
right
one
aunt
fulda
angelica
maintained
he
got
quite
red
in
the
face
yes
said
diavolo
gazing
at
father
ricardo
thoughtfully
he
looked
hot
enough
to
set
fire
to
us
if
he
touched
us
i
should
think
he
would
have
been
invaluable
in
the
inquisition
said
angelica
to
whom
that
last
remark
of
diavolo
had
opened
up
a
boundless
field
of
speculation
and
retrospect
would
you
like
to
hear
a
heretic
go
off
pop
on
a
pile
she
inquired
turning
to
father
ricardo
the
duke
and
lady
fulda
glanced
at
him
involuntarily
and
very
tried
to
smile
this
however
did
not
necessitate
such
an
effort
as
the
mere
cold
reading
of
the
twins
remark
might
make
it
appear
for
they
both
had
a
certain
charm
of
manner
expressive
of
an
utter
absence
of
any
intention
to
offend
which
no
kindly
disposed
person
could
resist
and
father
ricardo
was
essentially
kindly
disposed
the
twins
were
taking
their
leave
by
this
time
angelica
proceeded
to
deposit
one
of
her
erratic
kisses
somewhere
on
the
old
duke
head
with
an
emphasis
which
caused
him
to
wince
perceptibly
then
she
went
up
to
father
ricardo
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
hope
the
next
time
we
come
you
will
be
able
to
tell
us
some
nice
bogey
stories
about
death
and
the
judgment
and
hell
and
that
kind
of
thing
she
said
politely
they
interest
us
very
much
you
remember
you
told
us
some
before
it
must
be
very
jolly
for
grandpapa
to
have
you
here
always
ready
to
make
his
blood
run
cold
whenever
he
feels
dull
diavolo
observed
looking
up
at
the
priest
admiringly
you
do
it
so
well
you
know
just
as
if
you
believed
it
all
we
tried
it
once
with
some
children
we
had
to
spend
the
day
with
us
at
hamilton
house
angelica
said
we
took
them
into
a
dark
room
the
long
room
you
know
aunt
fulda
and
diavolo
rubbed
a
match
on
the
wall
at
the
far
end
and
i
explained
that
that
was
a
glimmer
of
at
a
great
distance
off
and
then
we
told
them
if
they
did
keep
quite
still
the
old
devil
himself
would
come
creeping
up
behind
without
any
noise
and
jump
on
their
backs
and
the
little
beggars
howled
diavolo
added
as
if
that
consequence
still
filled
him
with
astonishment
my
dear
children
i
am
afraid
you
tell
dreadful
stories
lady
fulda
exclaimed
in
a
horrified
tone
yes
said
angelica
with
her
grave
little
nod
and
we
improving
but
we
can
not
come
up
to
father
ricardo
yet
in
that
line
not
by
a
long
chalk
said
diavolo
but
my
child
lady
fulda
solemnly
asserted
father
ricardo
tells
you
but
what
is
true
how
do
you
know
angelica
asked
oh
oh
lady
fulda
stammered
and
then
looked
at
the
priest
appealingly
when
you
are
older
and
able
to
understand
these
things
father
ricardo
began
with
gentle
earnestness
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
but
how
do
you
it
true
yourself
angelica
demanded
did
you
ever
the
devil
with
his
little
spade
and
shovel
digging
praties
in
the
garden
with
his
tail
cocked
up
diavolo
chanted
accompanying
the
words
with
a
little
dance
in
which
angelica
holding
up
her
habit
joined
incontinently
lady
fulda
remained
grave
but
the
old
duke
and
father
ricardo
himself
were
moved
to
mirth
and
there
was
no
more
talk
of
revealed
religion
the
power
of
the
popedom
and
the
glory
of
the
church
on
earth
at
morne
that
day
lady
fulda
had
been
firm
about
sending
the
children
home
under
escort
and
they
found
a
steady
old
groom
waiting
ready
to
mount
a
spirited
horse
when
they
went
down
to
the
courtyard
to
get
on
their
ponies
they
had
discovered
a
box
of
croquet
mallets
on
their
way
downstairs
and
borrowed
one
each
as
they
descended
the
steep
hill
leading
from
the
castle
at
a
walk
they
began
to
discuss
recent
events
as
their
habit
was
what
did
you
do
when
the
chime
went
and
you
hung
your
head
said
angelica
i
hoped
there
be
hot
cakes
for
tea
bat
i
did
mean
it
for
a
prayer
diavolo
answered
as
if
the
matter
admitted
of
a
doubt
i
glad
we
decided
to
go
secondly
to
the
palace
i
did
think
much
of
grandpapa
tea
angelica
observed
it
was
all
china
and
no
cakes
to
speak
of
no
crisp
ones
you
know
well
you
see
his
teeth
are
bad
said
diavolo
indulgently
he
has
enough
of
them
then
angelica
answered
yes
but
they
are
much
good
they
so
loose
you
know
every
now
and
again
you
can
see
them
waggle
said
diavolo
i
like
to
see
him
bite
a
fig
said
angelica
chuckling
they
stick
i
suppose
said
diavolo
meditatively
i
expect
there
will
be
great
improvements
in
those
matters
by
the
time
we
want
to
be
patched
the
groom
who
had
been
riding
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
suddenly
perceived
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
children
altogether
the
descent
was
steep
just
there
and
winding
and
knowing
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
the
man
urged
his
horse
on
straining
his
eyes
at
every
turn
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
twins
but
vainly
till
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
when
they
bounced
out
on
him
suddenly
from
among
the
trees
on
either
side
of
the
road
whooping
and
flourishing
their
mallets
wildly
the
horse
which
was
very
fresh
gave
one
great
bound
and
bolted
and
the
heavenly
twins
shrieking
with
delight
hunted
him
hard
into
morningquest
when
they
arrived
at
the
palace
angelica
asked
with
the
utmost
confidence
if
the
bishop
were
at
home
and
being
informed
by
an
obsequious
footman
that
he
was
the
twins
marched
into
the
hall
and
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
beale
and
her
daughter
edith
tell
his
lordship
we
are
here
angelica
said
to
the
servant
authoritatively
before
she
performed
her
salutations
when
these
were
over
the
twins
sat
down
opposite
to
edith
and
inspected
her
we
just
been
seeing
aunt
fulda
diavolo
remarked
angelica
caught
the
connection
your
hair
is
about
the
same
colour
as
hers
but
your
face
is
smoother
she
observed
it
looks
like
porcelain
hers
has
little
stipples
you
know
about
the
nose
when
you
go
close
they
seem
to
come
as
you
get
older
uncle
dawne
calls
you
saxon
edith
said
diavolo
do
you
wonder
he
does
want
to
marry
you
do
when
i
old
enough
i
going
to
propose
to
you
do
you
think
you
will
have
me
have
you
i
should
think
not
indeed
angelica
exclaimed
with
a
jealous
flash
at
that
time
the
notion
of
sharing
her
brother
affection
with
anybody
always
enraged
her
diavolo
was
irritated
by
her
scornful
manner
i
am
a
little
afraid
he
began
addressing
beale
in
his
deliberate
way
i
am
a
little
afraid
angelica
will
stand
in
the
way
of
my
making
a
good
match
no
respectable
wife
would
have
her
about
quick
as
thought
angelica
had
him
by
the
hair
and
the
two
were
tumbling
over
each
other
on
the
floor
beale
and
edith
sprang
forward
to
separate
them
but
that
was
impossible
until
the
twins
had
banged
each
other
to
their
heart
content
when
they
got
up
with
their
feelings
thoroughly
relieved
and
resumed
their
seats
and
the
conversation
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
skirmish
however
had
been
severe
although
short
diavolo
had
a
deep
scratch
over
his
right
eyebrow
which
began
to
bleed
profusely
angelica
was
the
first
to
notice
it
and
tearing
out
a
handkerchief
which
was
up
her
sleeve
she
rolled
it
into
a
bandage
roughly
whirled
over
to
diavolo
and
tied
it
round
his
head
covering
his
right
eye
and
leaving
a
great
knot
and
two
long
ends
sticking
up
like
rabbit
ears
amongst
his
fair
hair
and
a
pointed
flap
hanging
down
on
the
opposite
side
i
must
cut
my
nails
she
remarked
giving
a
finishing
touch
to
this
labour
of
love
which
made
diavolo
rock
on
his
chair
but
he
accepted
her
attentions
as
a
merely
drawling
angelica
is
energetical
as
he
recovered
his
balance
just
at
this
moment
the
bishop
bustled
in
he
had
been
engaged
upon
some
important
diocesan
duties
when
the
twins
were
announced
but
thinking
they
must
have
come
with
an
urgent
message
he
suspended
the
work
of
the
diocese
and
hurried
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
twins
rose
to
receive
him
with
their
usual
unaffected
affability
he
was
a
short
stout
man
with
a
pleasant
face
and
a
cordial
manner
a
little
apt
to
be
fussy
on
occasion
and
destitute
of
any
sense
of
humour
in
other
people
although
given
to
making
his
own
little
jokes
he
was
a
bishop
of
the
kind
owing
his
position
to
family
influence
rather
than
to
any
special
attainment
or
qualification
but
he
was
a
good
man
and
popular
and
the
see
of
morningquest
would
have
had
much
to
regret
if
the
back
door
by
which
he
got
into
the
church
had
been
shut
before
he
passed
through
it
i
am
afraid
there
has
been
an
accident
he
said
with
concern
when
he
saw
diavolo
head
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
oh
no
thank
you
sir
that
young
gentleman
assured
him
it
is
only
a
scratch
did
it
said
the
candid
angelica
and
it
looked
unpleasant
so
i
tied
it
up
oh
the
bishop
ejaculated
glancing
inquiringly
at
his
wife
and
daughter
you
wanted
to
see
me
yes
said
diavolo
preparing
to
suit
his
conversation
to
the
taste
there
are
a
great
many
things
we
want
to
discuss
with
you
what
were
they
angelica
i
am
sure
i
have
forgotten
them
all
let
me
see
said
angelica
sainte
chantal
and
the
rotten
potato
had
quite
gone
out
of
her
mind
it
was
just
to
have
a
little
interesting
conversation
you
know
we
getting
on
very
well
with
our
lessons
diavolo
gravely
assured
him
anticipating
the
inevitable
question
we
just
come
from
morne
said
angelica
indeed
the
bishop
answered
how
is
your
grandfather
rather
flat
said
angelica
he
did
say
anything
of
interest
did
even
lecture
us
no
but
he
looked
pleasant
said
diavolo
i
like
him
to
lecture
angelica
insisted
i
like
him
to
talk
about
the
church
how
it
is
going
to
encompass
the
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
and
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
boom
boom
he
makes
you
feel
as
if
every
word
he
uttered
ought
to
be
printed
in
capital
letters
and
it
seems
as
if
your
eyes
opened
wider
and
wider
and
your
skin
got
tight
diavolo
nodded
his
head
to
one
side
in
intelligent
acquiescence
not
being
troubled
with
he
wore
the
handkerchief
with
which
his
head
was
decorated
with
the
grave
dignity
of
his
best
behaviour
i
sometimes
think
sir
he
began
addressing
the
bishop
exactly
in
his
father
precise
way
that
there
is
something
remarkable
about
my
grandfather
he
is
a
kind
of
a
prophet
i
imagine
to
whom
the
lord
does
speak
edith
walked
to
the
window
beale
got
out
her
handkerchief
hastily
the
bishop
countenance
relaxed
i
suppose
you
would
like
us
to
be
converted
angelica
asked
we
call
it
dear
child
said
beale
well
they
call
it
just
as
positively
up
at
the
castle
angelica
rejoined
not
argumentatively
merely
stating
the
fact
i
wonder
what
the
angels
call
it
said
diavolo
looking
up
in
their
direction
out
of
a
window
opposite
and
then
glancing
at
the
bishop
as
if
he
thought
he
ought
to
know
i
do
suppose
they
care
a
button
what
we
call
it
angelica
decided
out
of
her
own
inner
consciousness
but
you
would
not
like
us
to
be
either
or
would
you
she
asked
the
bishop
i
am
afraid
i
must
not
discuss
so
serious
a
question
with
you
he
answered
i
am
very
busy
and
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
i
thought
you
looked
unsettled
angelica
observed
i
know
what
it
is
when
you
got
to
come
to
the
drawing
room
and
want
to
be
somewhere
else
they
wo
excuse
us
at
home
as
a
rule
but
we
excuse
you
if
you
like
eh
thank
you
the
old
gentleman
answered
glancing
with
a
smile
at
his
wife
but
i
should
think
some
tea
would
do
you
good
diavolo
suggested
have
you
not
had
any
tea
edith
asked
stretching
her
hand
out
toward
the
bell
well
yes
he
answered
we
had
a
little
the
tone
implied
but
not
nearly
enough
we
always
like
your
cakes
you
know
said
angelica
and
ours
at
hamilton
house
are
generally
nice
but
at
morne
they
sometimes
sodden
the
bishop
withdrew
at
this
point
and
the
children
devoted
the
rest
of
their
attention
to
the
cakes
now
we
got
to
go
and
settle
with
ellis
diavolo
remarked
to
angelica
yawning
as
they
walked
their
ponies
out
of
the
palace
grounds
well
at
any
rate
we
done
the
celebration
thoroughly
she
answered
and
enjoyed
it
he
wo
be
able
to
help
that
now
oh
by
the
way
grandpapa
ring
i
forgot
it
it
does
matter
said
diavolo
he
knows
you
take
care
of
it
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
old
duke
at
morne
missed
the
ring
and
remarked
ah
i
remember
angelica
has
it
she
put
it
on
her
finger
when
she
was
sitting
beside
me
this
afternoon
shall
i
go
at
once
to
hamilton
house
and
bring
it
back
with
me
father
ricardo
asked
somewhat
officiously
no
sir
thank
you
said
the
duke
with
dignity
my
will
return
the
ring
when
it
suits
her
convenience
next
day
angelica
begged
her
father
to
take
the
ring
back
for
her
with
a
note
of
apology
explaining
that
she
had
forgotten
it
and
expressing
her
regret
chapter
xxi
part
of
the
old
gray
palace
at
morningquest
had
been
a
monastery
the
walls
were
thick
the
windows
gothic
the
bedrooms
small
the
reception
rooms
huge
as
if
built
for
the
accommodation
of
a
whole
community
at
a
time
and
with
unexpected
alcoves
and
angles
and
deep
embrasures
all
very
picturesque
and
also
extremely
inconvenient
but
edith
beale
who
had
been
born
in
the
palace
and
grown
up
there
under
the
protection
of
the
great
cathedral
as
it
were
and
the
influence
of
its
wonderful
chime
was
never
conscious
of
the
inconvenience
and
would
not
at
any
rate
have
exchanged
it
for
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
the
best
appointed
modern
house
the
bishop
of
morningquest
and
beale
had
three
sons
but
edith
was
their
only
daughter
their
white
child
their
pearl
and
certainly
she
was
a
lovely
specimen
of
a
english
girl
on
the
day
following
that
upon
which
the
heavenly
twins
had
celebrated
the
important
occasion
of
their
first
spontaneous
as
they
called
it
in
the
early
morning
edith
being
still
asleep
turned
toward
the
east
window
of
her
room
the
blind
of
which
was
up
and
fell
into
a
dream
the
sun
as
he
rose
smiled
in
upon
her
she
had
flung
her
left
hand
up
above
her
head
with
the
pink
palm
outward
and
the
fingers
half
bent
the
right
lay
on
the
sheet
beside
her
palm
downward
spread
out
and
all
relaxed
her
whole
attitude
expressed
the
most
complete
abandonment
of
deep
and
restful
sleep
the
night
had
been
warm
and
the
heavier
draperies
had
slipped
from
her
bed
on
the
farther
side
leaving
only
the
sheet
her
warm
bright
hair
partly
loosened
from
the
one
thick
braid
into
which
it
had
been
plaited
fell
from
off
the
pillow
to
the
floor
on
her
right
and
the
sun
looking
in
lit
it
up
and
made
it
sparkle
she
left
that
window
with
the
blind
undrawn
so
that
he
might
arouse
her
every
morning
and
now
as
the
first
pale
ray
gleamed
over
her
face
her
eyelids
quivered
and
half
opened
but
she
was
still
busy
with
her
dream
and
did
not
wake
she
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
dreams
and
of
mystic
old
associations
events
of
the
days
gone
by
were
often
more
distinctly
pictured
in
her
mind
than
incidents
of
yesterday
orton
beg
her
mother
and
all
the
gentle
mannered
women
among
whom
she
had
grown
up
thought
less
of
this
world
even
as
they
knew
it
than
of
the
next
as
they
imagined
it
to
be
and
they
received
and
treasured
with
perfect
faith
every
legend
hint
and
shadow
of
a
communication
which
they
believed
to
have
come
to
them
from
thence
they
neglected
the
good
they
might
have
done
here
in
order
to
enjoy
their
bright
and
tranquil
dreams
of
the
hereafter
their
spiritual
food
was
faith
and
hope
they
kept
their
tempers
even
and
unruffled
by
never
allowing
themselves
to
think
or
know
so
far
as
it
is
possible
with
average
intelligence
not
to
do
either
in
this
world
anything
that
is
evil
of
anybody
they
prided
themselves
on
only
believing
all
that
is
good
of
their
this
was
their
idea
of
christian
charity
thus
they
always
believed
the
best
about
everybody
not
on
evidence
but
upon
principle
and
then
they
acted
as
if
their
attitude
had
made
their
acquaintances
all
they
desired
them
to
be
they
seemed
to
think
that
by
ignoring
the
existence
of
sin
by
refusing
to
obtain
any
knowledge
of
it
they
somehow
helped
to
check
it
and
they
could
not
have
conceived
that
their
attitude
made
it
safe
to
sin
so
that
when
they
refused
to
know
and
to
resist
they
were
actually
countenancing
evil
and
encouraging
it
the
kind
of
christian
charity
from
which
they
suffered
was
a
vice
in
itself
to
keep
their
own
minds
pure
was
the
great
object
of
their
lives
which
really
meant
to
save
themselves
from
the
horror
and
pain
of
knowing
edith
by
descent
by
teaching
by
association
and
in
virtue
of
the
complete
ignorance
in
which
she
had
been
kept
was
essentially
one
of
that
set
it
is
impossible
for
any
adult
creature
to
be
more
spiritually
minded
than
she
was
she
lived
in
a
state
of
exquisite
feeling
the
whole
training
of
her
mind
had
been
so
directed
as
to
make
her
existence
one
long
beatific
vision
and
she
was
unconsciously
prepared
to
resent
in
her
gentle
way
and
to
banish
at
once
if
possible
any
disturbing
thought
that
might
break
in
upon
it
in
her
dream
that
morning
she
smiled
at
first
and
then
she
fairly
laughed
she
had
met
the
heavenly
twins
and
they
were
telling
her
something
what
was
it
the
most
amusing
thing
she
had
ever
heard
them
say
she
knew
it
by
the
way
it
had
made
her
laugh
why
could
she
repeat
it
she
was
trying
to
tell
her
mother
and
while
in
the
act
she
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
strange
place
and
diavolo
kneeling
at
her
feet
clasping
her
left
hand
and
kissing
it
she
felt
the
touch
of
his
lips
distinctly
they
were
soft
and
warm
he
was
beseeching
her
to
marry
him
she
understood
and
she
was
going
to
laugh
at
him
for
being
a
ridiculous
boy
but
it
was
the
steadfast
dark
blue
eyes
of
lord
dawne
that
met
hers
and
she
was
looking
up
at
him
and
not
down
at
the
diavolo
kneeling
before
her
she
caught
the
gloss
on
lord
dawne
black
hair
the
curve
of
his
slight
moustache
and
the
gleam
of
his
white
teeth
he
was
grave
but
his
lips
were
parted
and
he
carried
a
little
child
in
his
arms
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
like
the
dear
lord
in
a
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
which
she
had
in
her
room
he
held
the
little
child
out
to
her
she
took
it
from
him
smiling
raised
its
little
velvet
cheek
to
hers
and
then
drew
back
to
look
at
it
but
was
horrified
because
it
was
not
beautiful
at
all
as
it
had
been
the
moment
before
but
deformed
and
its
poor
little
body
was
covered
with
sores
the
sight
sickened
her
and
she
tried
to
cover
it
with
her
own
clothes
she
tore
at
the
skirt
of
her
gown
she
struggled
to
take
off
a
cloak
she
wore
she
stripped
herself
in
the
endeavour
and
cried
aloud
in
her
shame
but
she
could
not
help
herself
and
dawne
could
not
help
her
and
in
the
agony
of
the
attempt
she
awoke
and
sprang
up
clutching
at
the
bedclothes
but
was
not
able
to
find
them
at
first
because
they
had
fallen
on
the
floor
and
she
fancied
herself
still
in
her
horrible
dream
big
drops
of
perspiration
stood
on
her
forehead
her
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
sun
and
she
was
all
confused
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
stood
a
moment
trying
to
collect
herself
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
distinctly
was
the
picture
of
the
saviour
on
the
wall
a
stood
beneath
it
and
she
went
and
knelt
there
her
beautiful
yellow
hair
streaming
behind
her
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
wonderful
sad
sweet
face
dear
lord
she
prayed
passionately
keep
me
from
all
knowledge
of
unholy
things
by
which
she
meant
sights
and
circumstances
that
were
unlovely
and
horrified
she
knelt
for
some
minutes
longer
with
all
articulate
thought
suspended
but
by
degrees
there
came
to
her
that
glow
in
the
chest
that
expansion
of
it
which
is
the
accompaniment
of
the
exalted
sentiment
known
to
us
as
adoration
or
love
love
purged
of
all
earthly
admixture
of
doubt
and
fear
which
is
the
most
delicious
sensation
human
nature
is
capable
of
experiencing
and
presently
she
arose
free
from
the
painful
impression
made
by
the
revolting
details
of
her
dream
put
her
hands
under
her
hair
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
then
raised
them
up
above
her
head
and
her
hair
with
them
stretching
herself
and
yawning
slightly
then
she
brought
her
hair
all
around
to
the
right
in
a
mass
and
let
it
hang
down
to
her
knees
and
looked
at
it
dreamily
and
then
began
to
twist
it
slowly
preparatory
to
coiling
it
round
her
head
she
went
to
the
for
hairpins
to
fasten
it
holding
up
her
long
nightdress
above
her
white
feet
with
one
hand
that
she
might
not
trip
and
standing
before
the
mirror
blushed
at
the
beauty
of
her
own
reflection
when
she
had
put
her
hair
out
of
the
way
she
glanced
at
her
bed
somewhat
longingly
then
at
her
watch
it
was
very
early
and
the
morning
was
chilly
so
she
put
on
her
white
flannel
dressing
gown
got
a
book
returned
to
her
bed
and
propped
herself
up
in
a
comfortable
position
for
reading
and
so
she
spent
the
time
happily
until
her
maid
came
to
call
her
her
book
that
morning
was
the
life
of
frances
ridley
havergal
and
she
found
it
absorbingly
interesting
chapter
xxii
the
ladies
of
an
artist
family
usually
arrange
and
decorate
their
rooms
in
a
way
which
recalls
the
manner
called
artistic
more
especially
when
the
artist
is
a
figure
or
subject
as
distinguished
from
a
landscape
painter
for
the
latter
lives
too
much
in
the
free
fresh
air
to
cultivate
draperies
even
if
he
does
not
absolutely
detest
them
as
being
stuffy
and
in
the
same
way
the
bedroom
of
the
only
daughter
of
the
bishop
of
morningquest
would
have
made
you
think
of
matters
ecclesiastical
the
room
itself
with
its
thick
walls
high
stone
mantelpiece
small
gothic
windows
and
plain
ridged
vault
was
so
in
fact
and
a
sense
of
suitability
as
well
as
the
natural
inclination
of
the
occupant
had
led
her
to
choose
the
furniture
and
decoration
as
severely
in
keeping
as
possible
the
pictures
consisted
of
photographs
or
engravings
of
sacred
subjects
all
of
roman
catholic
origin
there
was
a
virgin
and
child
by
botticelli
and
another
by
perugini
our
lady
of
the
cat
by
baroccio
the
exquisite
vision
of
helena
by
paolo
veronese
correggio
ecce
homo
and
others
less
with
a
ghastly
crucifixion
too
painful
to
be
endured
especially
by
a
young
girl
had
not
custom
dulled
all
genuine
perception
of
the
horror
of
it
the
whole
effect
however
was
a
delicious
impression
of
freshness
and
serenity
which
inspired
something
of
the
same
respect
for
edith
sanctum
that
one
felt
for
edith
herself
as
was
evident
on
one
occasion
when
the
ladies
of
his
family
being
absent
the
bishop
of
morningquest
had
taken
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
a
gentleman
who
had
lately
settled
in
that
neighbourhood
over
the
palace
when
they
came
to
edith
room
he
had
opened
the
door
absently
and
then
remembering
whose
it
was
he
said
my
daughter
room
and
they
had
both
looked
in
without
entering
and
both
becoming
aware
at
the
same
moment
that
they
had
their
hats
on
removed
them
involuntarily
edith
dress
too
was
characteristic
all
the
ornamentation
was
out
of
sight
the
lining
of
her
gowns
being
often
more
costly
than
the
materials
of
which
they
were
made
in
the
same
way
her
simple
unaffected
manners
were
the
plain
garment
which
concealed
the
fine
quality
and
cultivation
of
her
mind
she
might
have
done
great
good
in
the
world
had
she
known
of
the
evil
she
would
have
fought
for
the
right
in
defiance
of
every
prejudice
as
women
do
but
she
had
never
been
allowed
to
see
the
enemy
she
had
been
fitted
by
education
to
move
in
the
society
of
saints
and
angels
only
and
so
rendered
as
unsuited
as
she
was
unprepared
to
cope
with
the
world
she
would
have
to
meet
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
as
she
herself
would
have
phrased
it
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
her
when
she
left
her
room
that
morning
she
went
to
her
mother
sitting
room
which
was
on
the
same
floor
edith
and
her
mother
usually
breakfasted
here
together
sometimes
the
bishop
joined
them
and
chatted
over
an
extra
cup
of
tea
but
he
was
an
early
riser
and
had
generally
breakfasted
with
his
chaplain
and
private
secretary
and
done
an
hour
work
or
so
before
his
wife
appeared
for
beale
was
delicate
at
that
time
and
obliged
to
forego
the
early
breakfast
with
her
husband
which
had
hitherto
been
the
habit
and
pleasure
of
her
whole
married
life
the
bishop
did
not
come
up
to
the
sitting
room
that
morning
however
and
when
edith
and
her
mother
had
breakfasted
they
read
the
psalms
for
the
day
together
and
a
chapter
of
the
bible
verse
by
verse
then
edith
wrote
some
notes
for
her
mother
who
was
busy
making
a
cushion
for
a
bazaar
after
which
she
went
into
the
garden
and
gathered
flowers
in
one
of
the
conservatories
which
she
brought
in
to
paint
on
a
screen
she
was
making
also
for
the
bazaar
mother
and
daughter
worked
together
without
any
conversation
to
speak
of
until
lunch
they
were
too
busy
to
talk
after
lunch
they
drove
out
into
the
country
and
paid
a
call
on
the
way
back
edith
noticed
a
beggar
a
young
slender
very
girl
lying
across
the
footpath
with
her
feet
toward
the
road
a
tiny
baby
lay
on
her
lap
her
head
and
shoulders
were
pillowed
upon
the
high
bank
which
flanked
the
path
her
face
was
raised
as
if
her
last
look
had
been
up
at
the
sky
above
her
her
hands
had
slipped
helplessly
on
to
the
ground
on
either
side
of
her
releasing
the
child
which
had
rolled
over
on
to
its
face
and
so
continued
inertly
edith
caught
only
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
group
and
she
made
no
remark
until
they
had
driven
on
some
distance
but
then
she
asked
did
you
notice
that
poor
girl
mother
no
beale
answered
where
was
she
lying
on
the
ground
she
had
a
baby
on
her
lap
i
think
she
was
they
were
in
an
open
carriage
and
beale
looked
round
over
the
back
of
it
it
was
a
straight
road
but
she
could
only
see
something
lying
on
the
footpath
which
looked
like
a
bundle
at
that
distance
are
you
sure
it
was
a
girl
she
said
yes
quite
mother
edith
answered
stop
the
carriage
then
said
beale
and
we
will
turn
back
and
see
what
we
can
do
they
found
the
girl
in
the
same
attitude
edith
was
about
to
alight
but
her
mother
stopped
her
let
edwards
the
footman
who
was
an
old
servant
see
what
is
the
matter
she
said
edith
instantly
sat
down
again
and
the
footman
went
and
stood
by
the
girl
looking
down
at
her
curiously
then
he
stooped
took
off
his
glove
and
put
the
points
of
the
four
fingers
of
his
right
hand
on
her
chest
like
an
amateur
doctor
afraid
of
soiling
his
hands
a
perfunctory
way
of
ascertaining
if
she
still
breathed
i
know
who
it
is
he
said
returning
to
the
carriage
french
and
was
a
dressmaker
in
there
were
two
of
them
sisters
doing
a
very
good
business
but
they
got
to
know
some
of
the
gentry
beale
stopped
him
she
would
not
have
heard
the
story
for
the
world
she
not
dead
is
she
edith
asked
in
a
horrified
tone
the
man
looked
at
the
girl
again
from
where
he
stood
no
miss
he
answered
i
think
not
she
dead
beat
after
a
long
tramp
the
soles
are
wore
off
her
shoes
or
likely
she
fainted
it
a
pity
of
her
he
added
for
the
relief
of
his
own
feelings
looking
at
her
again
compassionately
oh
mother
ca
we
do
something
edith
exclaimed
but
what
we
do
beale
responded
helplessly
looking
at
edwards
for
a
suggestion
we
not
very
far
from
the
workus
he
said
looking
down
the
road
they
had
just
retraversed
we
might
call
there
as
we
pass
and
leave
a
message
for
them
to
send
and
take
her
in
let
us
go
at
once
said
beale
in
a
tone
of
relief
edith
whose
face
was
pale
looked
pityingly
once
more
at
the
girl
and
her
little
child
as
they
drove
off
it
had
not
occurred
to
either
of
the
two
ladies
gentle
tender
and
good
as
they
were
to
take
the
poor
dusty
disgraced
tramp
into
their
carriage
and
restore
her
to
life
and
use
and
name
and
fame
as
they
might
have
done
the
incident
however
had
naturally
made
a
painful
impression
upon
them
both
and
when
they
returned
to
the
palace
they
ordered
tea
in
the
drawing
room
immediately
feeling
that
they
must
have
something
and
went
there
with
their
things
still
on
to
wait
for
it
neither
of
them
could
get
the
tramp
and
her
baby
out
of
their
heads
but
they
had
not
mentioned
her
since
they
came
in
until
beale
broke
a
long
silence
by
exclaiming
we
will
drive
that
way
again
and
find
out
how
they
are
edith
needed
no
explanation
as
to
whom
she
was
alluding
they
would
take
her
in
at
once
of
course
mother
they
could
not
put
it
off
she
said
oh
no
not
when
we
asked
them
her
mother
answered
the
tea
was
brought
at
this
moment
and
immediately
afterward
the
footman
announced
from
the
door
sir
mosley
menteith
and
a
tall
man
about
thirty
with
a
small
fine
moustache
the
ends
of
which
were
waxed
and
turned
up
toward
the
corners
of
his
eyes
entered
and
shook
hands
with
beale
looking
into
her
face
intently
as
he
did
so
as
if
he
particularly
wanted
to
see
what
she
was
like
then
he
turned
to
edith
shook
hands
and
looked
at
her
intently
also
and
taking
a
seat
near
her
he
continued
to
scrutinize
her
in
away
that
brought
the
blood
to
her
cheeks
and
caused
her
to
drop
her
eyes
every
time
she
looked
at
him
but
they
were
old
acquaintances
and
she
was
not
displeased
he
was
a
young
man
although
he
had
a
face
which
some
people
called
empty
because
of
the
singular
immobility
of
every
feature
except
his
eyes
but
whether
the
set
expression
was
worn
as
a
mask
or
whether
he
really
had
nothing
in
him
was
a
question
which
could
only
be
decided
on
intimate
acquaintance
for
although
some
effect
of
personality
continually
suggested
the
presence
in
him
of
thoughts
and
feelings
disguised
or
concealed
by
an
affectation
of
impassivity
nothing
he
did
or
said
at
an
ordinary
interview
ever
either
quite
confirmed
or
destroyed
the
impression
i
thought
you
had
gone
abroad
with
your
regiment
said
beale
who
had
received
him
cordially
no
not
yet
he
answered
looking
away
from
edith
for
a
minute
in
order
to
scrutinize
her
mother
he
always
seemed
to
be
inspecting
the
person
he
addressed
and
never
spoke
of
anyone
without
describing
their
charms
or
blemishes
categorically
fact
is
i
just
come
to
say
i
been
abroad
on
leave
for
two
months
took
mine
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
he
looked
intently
at
edith
again
when
he
had
said
this
orton
beg
the
servant
announced
orton
beg
ankle
was
strong
enough
now
for
her
to
walk
from
her
little
house
in
the
close
to
the
palace
but
she
had
to
use
a
stick
she
was
bleached
by
being
so
much
indoors
and
looked
very
fragile
in
the
costly
simplicity
of
her
black
draperies
as
she
entered
beale
and
edith
received
her
affectionately
and
sir
mosley
rose
and
transferred
his
scrutinizing
gaze
to
her
while
they
were
so
occupied
he
inspected
her
dark
glossy
hair
eyes
nose
mouth
and
figure
down
to
her
feet
then
looked
into
her
eyes
again
and
bowed
on
being
presented
by
beale
sir
mosley
is
in
the
colquhoun
highlanders
the
latter
explained
to
orton
beg
he
is
just
going
out
to
malta
to
join
them
orton
beg
looked
up
at
him
with
interest
from
the
low
chair
into
which
she
had
subsided
then
you
know
my
niece
i
suppose
she
said
mrs
colquhoun
i
have
not
yet
the
pleasure
he
answered
smiling
so
that
he
showed
his
teeth
they
were
somewhat
discoloured
by
tobacco
but
the
smile
was
a
pleasant
one
to
which
people
instantly
responded
he
went
to
the
tea
table
when
he
had
spoken
and
stood
there
waiting
to
hand
orton
beg
a
cup
of
tea
which
beale
was
pouring
out
for
her
but
i
have
seen
colquhoun
he
added
i
was
at
the
wedding
she
looked
remarkably
well
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
vacancy
here
and
turned
his
attention
inward
in
order
to
contemplate
a
vision
of
evadne
in
her
wedding
dress
his
first
question
about
a
strange
woman
was
always
is
she
and
his
first
thought
when
one
whom
he
knew
happened
to
be
mentioned
was
always
as
to
whether
she
was
attractive
in
appearance
or
not
he
was
one
of
several
of
colonel
colquhoun
brother
officers
who
had
graced
the
wedding
there
was
not
much
variety
amongst
them
they
were
all
excessively
clean
and
neat
in
appearance
their
manners
in
society
were
unexceptionable
the
morals
of
most
of
them
not
worth
describing
because
there
was
so
little
of
them
and
their
comments
to
each
other
on
the
occasion
neither
original
nor
refined
generations
of
them
had
made
the
same
remarks
under
similar
circumstances
the
bishop
came
in
during
the
little
diversion
caused
by
handing
tea
and
cake
to
orton
beg
ah
how
do
you
do
he
said
shaking
hands
with
the
latter
how
is
the
foot
better
that
right
oh
is
that
you
mosley
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
boy
here
they
shook
hands
i
did
not
see
you
at
first
very
glad
you
come
i
sure
how
is
your
mother
not
with
your
regiment
eh
he
peered
at
sir
mosley
through
a
pair
of
very
thick
glasses
he
wore
and
seemed
to
read
an
answer
to
each
question
as
he
put
it
written
on
the
latter
face
will
you
have
some
tea
dear
said
beale
eh
what
did
you
say
my
dear
tea
yes
if
you
please
that
is
what
i
came
for
he
turned
to
the
tea
table
as
he
spoke
and
stood
over
it
rubbing
his
hands
and
beaming
about
him
blandly
sir
mosley
menteith
had
been
a
good
deal
at
the
palace
as
a
youngster
he
and
edith
still
called
each
other
by
their
christian
names
the
bishop
had
seen
him
grow
up
from
a
boy
and
knew
all
about
him
so
he
would
have
said
although
he
had
not
seen
much
of
him
and
had
heard
absolutely
nothing
for
several
years
so
you
are
not
with
your
regiment
he
repeated
interrogatively
i
am
just
on
my
way
to
join
it
now
the
young
man
answered
looking
up
at
the
bishop
from
the
chair
near
edith
on
which
he
was
again
sitting
and
giving
the
corners
of
his
little
light
moustache
a
twirl
on
either
side
when
he
had
spoken
all
his
features
except
his
eyes
preserved
an
imperturbable
gravity
his
lips
moved
but
without
altering
the
expression
of
his
face
his
eyes
however
inspected
the
bishop
intelligently
and
always
when
he
spoke
to
him
they
rested
on
some
one
point
his
vest
his
gaiters
his
apron
the
top
of
his
bald
head
the
end
of
his
nose
galbraith
the
footman
announced
and
the
doctor
entered
in
his
easy
unaffected
but
somewhat
awkward
way
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
there
was
a
shade
of
weariness
or
depression
on
his
strong
pale
face
but
his
deep
gray
kindly
eyes
the
redeeming
feature
were
as
sympathetically
penetrating
as
usual
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
except
sir
mosley
at
whom
he
just
glanced
sufficiently
long
to
perceive
that
he
was
a
stranger
beale
named
them
to
each
other
and
they
both
bowed
slightly
looking
at
the
ground
and
then
they
exchanged
glances
not
much
like
a
medico
if
you
are
one
thought
menteith
not
difficult
to
take
your
measure
thought
the
doctor
after
which
he
turned
at
once
to
the
like
one
at
home
and
stood
there
waiting
for
a
cup
his
manner
was
quite
unassuming
but
he
was
one
of
those
men
of
marked
individuality
who
change
the
social
atmosphere
of
a
room
when
they
enter
it
people
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
strength
almost
before
they
saw
him
or
heard
him
speak
and
he
possessed
that
peculiar
charm
common
to
lord
dawne
and
others
of
their
set
which
came
of
giving
the
whole
of
their
attention
to
the
person
with
whom
they
were
conversing
for
the
moment
his
eyes
never
wandered
and
if
his
interest
flagged
he
did
not
allow
the
fact
to
become
apparent
so
that
he
drew
from
everybody
the
best
that
was
in
them
and
people
not
ordinarily
brilliant
were
often
surprised
on
reflection
at
the
amount
of
information
they
had
been
displaying
and
the
number
of
ideas
which
had
come
crowding
into
their
usually
vacant
minds
while
he
talked
with
them
he
turned
his
attention
to
beale
now
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
late
for
tea
he
said
i
had
to
turn
back
about
something
i
was
delayed
we
were
late
ourselves
this
afternoon
said
beale
curiously
enough
the
same
cause
had
delayed
them
both
for
galbraith
coming
into
morningquest
by
the
road
beale
had
chosen
for
her
drive
that
day
had
noticed
the
insensible
girl
and
her
baby
lying
on
the
footpath
and
had
got
down
lifted
them
into
his
carriage
and
driven
back
some
miles
with
them
in
order
to
leave
them
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
tenants
a
respectable
widow
whom
he
had
trained
as
a
nurse
and
to
whose
kind
care
he
now
confided
them
with
strict
orders
for
their
comfort
and
the
wherewithal
to
carry
the
orders
out
galbraith
took
his
tea
now
and
sat
down
he
had
come
for
a
special
purpose
and
hastened
to
broach
the
subject
at
once
have
you
decided
where
to
go
this
winter
he
asked
beale
you
will
be
having
another
attack
of
bronchitis
and
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
travel
it
is
not
safe
to
put
it
off
too
long
his
orders
were
that
she
should
winter
abroad
that
year
and
edith
was
to
accompany
her
but
they
were
both
reluctant
to
go
because
of
the
bishop
whose
duties
obliged
him
to
remain
behind
alone
beale
glanced
at
him
now
affectionately
he
was
leaning
back
in
a
low
chair
paunch
protuberant
and
little
legs
crossed
and
he
answered
the
look
with
a
smile
which
was
meant
to
be
encouraging
but
was
only
disturbed
he
was
a
perfect
coward
this
ruler
of
a
great
diocese
in
matters
which
were
of
moment
to
the
health
and
of
his
own
family
he
hated
to
have
to
decide
for
them
why
not
come
to
malta
sir
mosley
suggested
that
would
be
nice
for
evadne
orton
beg
exclaimed
her
mind
taking
in
at
a
glance
all
the
advantage
for
the
latter
of
having
a
companion
of
her
own
age
and
without
quirks
like
edith
and
the
womanly
restraining
influence
of
a
friend
like
dear
old
beale
what
kind
of
a
place
is
malta
the
bishop
asked
generally
tapping
the
edge
of
his
saucer
with
his
teaspoon
then
addressing
galbraith
in
particular
he
added
would
it
be
suitable
just
the
thing
the
latter
answered
picturesque
good
society
and
delightful
climate
at
this
time
of
the
year
accessible
too
you
can
go
directly
by
and
and
the
little
sea
voyage
would
be
good
for
mrs
beale
it
would
be
nice
to
have
evadne
there
said
edith
considering
the
proposition
favourably
i
have
hardly
seen
her
at
all
since
we
were
both
in
the
nursery
she
was
such
a
quiet
child
said
beale
unnaturally
so
but
they
used
to
say
she
was
clever
she
is
said
orton
beg
decidedly
so
and
original
or
rather
i
believe
that
is
the
proper
word
now
oh
dear
said
beale
is
that
nice
well
orton
beg
answered
smiling
i
can
not
say
it
is
not
a
matter
of
law
you
know
but
of
opinion
evadne
is
nice
however
so
much
i
will
venture
to
declare
she
used
to
be
very
good
to
the
little
beale
gave
out
as
a
point
in
her
favour
oh
you
hear
about
the
heavenly
twins
yesterday
edith
exclaimed
addressing
galbraith
they
came
to
call
on
papa
and
he
could
make
out
what
they
wanted
he
did
look
so
puzzled
and
they
sat
down
and
endeavoured
to
draw
him
into
a
theological
discussion
after
having
had
a
fight
on
the
floor
the
children
i
mean
not
papa
of
course
they
always
endeavour
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
people
with
whom
they
happen
to
be
said
galbraith
when
they
call
upon
me
they
come
primed
with
medical
matters
and
discuss
the
present
condition
of
surgical
practice
and
the
future
prospects
of
advance
in
that
direction
and
i
rather
suspect
that
my
own
books
and
papers
are
the
sources
from
which
they
derive
their
information
i
lock
up
my
library
and
consulting
rooms
now
as
a
rule
when
i
go
out
but
sometimes
i
forget
to
shut
the
windows
they
are
very
singular
little
people
said
the
bishop
with
his
benign
smile
very
singular
they
are
very
little
people
i
think
said
beale
galbraith
laughed
as
at
some
ludicrous
reminiscence
but
will
you
come
to
malta
said
sir
mosley
because
if
you
will
and
would
allow
me
i
could
see
about
making
arrangements
for
your
accommodation
you
are
very
kind
said
the
bishop
but
when
should
we
be
obliged
to
go
mrs
beale
asked
meaning
how
long
may
we
stay
at
home
you
must
go
as
soon
as
possible
galbraith
decided
inexorably
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
after
some
little
discussion
of
details
during
which
lady
adeline
and
frayling
came
in
the
latter
was
in
morningquest
for
the
day
doing
some
shopping
she
had
lunched
with
her
sister
orton
beg
and
had
come
to
have
tea
with
beale
and
she
and
lady
adeline
had
encountered
each
other
at
the
door
frayling
looked
very
well
she
was
a
wonderfully
preserved
woman
and
being
of
an
elastic
temperament
a
day
away
from
home
always
sufficed
to
smooth
out
the
wrinkles
which
her
husband
peculiar
method
of
loving
and
cherishing
her
tended
to
confirm
and
she
was
especially
buoyant
just
then
for
it
was
immediately
after
the
battle
of
the
letters
and
frayling
was
so
meek
in
his
manner
and
she
felt
altogether
so
free
and
independent
that
she
had
actually
ventured
to
come
into
morningquest
that
day
without
first
humbly
asking
his
permission
she
had
just
informed
him
of
her
intention
and
walked
out
before
he
could
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
oppose
it
galbraith
had
taken
his
leave
when
they
entered
the
room
and
only
waited
a
moment
afterward
to
exchange
a
word
with
lady
adeline
when
he
had
gone
sir
mosley
asked
the
latter
who
had
known
him
since
he
was
a
boy
but
did
not
love
him
is
that
ugly
man
a
medical
doctor
yes
she
answered
in
her
gentle
but
downright
way
he
a
medical
man
but
not
an
man
at
all
is
mosley
calling
galbraith
ugly
beale
exclaimed
now
think
he
has
the
face
a
most
kind
of
ugliness
said
orton
beg
menteith
perceived
that
any
attempt
to
disparage
galbraith
in
that
set
was
a
mistake
and
retired
from
the
position
cleverly
there
is
a
kind
of
ugliness
which
is
attractive
in
a
man
he
said
with
his
infectious
smile
edith
responded
and
then
they
drew
apart
from
the
rest
and
began
to
talk
to
each
other
exclusively
there
was
a
bright
tinge
of
colour
in
her
transparent
cheeks
her
eyes
sparkled
and
a
pleased
perpetual
smile
hovered
about
her
lips
the
entrance
of
sir
mosley
menteith
had
changed
the
unemotional
feminine
atmosphere
he
was
an
eligible
and
his
near
neighbourhood
caused
the
girl
heart
to
swell
with
a
sensation
like
enthusiasm
she
felt
as
if
she
could
be
eloquent
but
no
suitable
subject
presented
itself
and
so
she
said
little
she
was
very
glad
however
and
she
looked
so
and
naturally
she
thought
no
more
for
the
moment
of
the
poor
little
french
girl
who
was
just
then
awaking
to
a
sense
of
pain
mental
and
physical
to
horror
of
the
past
and
fear
for
the
future
and
the
heavy
sense
of
an
existence
marred
not
by
reason
of
her
own
weakness
so
much
as
by
the
possession
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
qualities
in
human
nature
the
power
to
love
and
trust
is
the
old
swing
still
on
the
elm
said
sir
mosley
yes
edith
answered
not
exactly
the
same
rope
you
know
but
we
keep
a
swing
there
always
who
uses
it
now
children
who
come
to
see
us
she
said
and
sometimes
i
sit
in
it
myself
she
added
laughing
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
it
again
he
said
come
and
see
it
then
she
answered
rising
as
she
spoke
mosley
wants
to
see
the
old
swing
she
said
to
her
mother
as
they
left
the
room
together
what
a
nice
looking
young
man
frayling
observed
his
head
is
too
small
lady
adeline
said
has
he
anything
in
him
oh
yes
well
good
average
abilities
i
should
say
beale
rejoined
too
much
ability
you
know
is
rather
dangerous
men
with
many
ideas
so
often
get
into
mischief
that
is
true
said
frayling
and
it
is
worse
with
women
when
have
ideas
as
my
husband
was
saying
only
this
morning
they
become
quite
outrageous
ideas
of
course
i
mean
you
know
he
seems
to
admire
edith
very
much
orton
beg
observed
beale
smiled
complacently
edith
sat
long
in
her
room
that
night
on
the
seat
of
the
window
that
faced
the
east
she
had
taken
off
her
evening
dress
and
put
on
her
white
flannel
wrapper
the
soft
material
draped
itself
to
her
figure
and
fell
in
heavy
folds
to
her
feet
her
beautiful
hair
which
was
arranged
for
the
night
in
one
great
plait
with
the
ends
loose
hung
down
to
the
ground
beside
her
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
but
not
visible
from
where
she
sat
its
light
however
flooded
the
open
spaces
of
the
garden
beneath
her
and
cast
great
shadows
of
the
trees
across
the
lawn
the
sombre
afternoon
had
cleared
to
a
frosty
night
and
the
deep
indigo
sky
was
sparsely
sprinkled
with
brilliant
stars
edith
looked
out
she
saw
the
stars
and
the
earth
with
its
heavy
shadows
and
the
wavering
outlines
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
felt
a
kinship
with
them
she
was
very
happy
but
she
did
not
think
she
did
not
want
to
think
when
any
obtrusive
thought
presented
itself
she
instantly
strove
to
banish
it
and
at
first
she
succeeded
she
wanted
to
recall
the
pleasurable
sensations
of
the
day
and
to
prolong
them
the
last
sixteen
hours
seemed
longer
in
the
retrospect
than
any
other
measure
of
time
with
which
she
had
been
acquainted
she
felt
as
if
the
terrible
dream
from
which
she
had
awakened
that
morning
in
affright
had
happened
in
some
other
state
of
being
which
ended
abruptly
while
she
was
pacing
the
shady
walks
of
the
old
palace
garden
with
mosley
menteith
in
the
afternoon
and
was
now
only
to
be
vaguely
recalled
some
great
change
in
herself
had
taken
place
since
then
she
would
not
define
it
she
imagined
she
could
not
but
she
knew
what
it
was
all
the
same
and
rejoiced
they
were
going
to
malta
the
feeling
resolved
itself
into
that
clear
idea
inevitably
and
after
a
little
pause
it
was
followed
by
the
question
well
and
what
then
but
either
her
mind
refused
to
receive
the
reply
or
else
in
the
book
of
fate
the
answer
was
still
unwritten
for
none
came
to
her
consciousness
turning
at
last
from
the
window
she
found
the
eyes
of
the
good
shepherd
in
the
picture
fixed
upon
her
the
beautiful
benign
eyes
she
loved
so
well
and
looking
up
at
him
responsively
she
waited
a
moment
for
her
heart
to
expand
anew
and
then
set
herself
to
meditate
upon
his
life
it
was
a
religious
exercise
she
had
taught
herself
not
knowing
that
the
roman
catholics
practise
it
as
a
duty
always
she
thought
of
him
first
as
the
dear
lord
who
died
for
her
and
her
heart
awoke
trembling
with
joy
and
fear
at
the
realization
of
the
glorious
deed
his
tenderness
came
upon
her
and
she
bowed
her
head
to
receive
it
her
ears
were
straining
as
it
were
to
hear
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
she
sank
on
her
knees
before
his
image
to
be
the
nearer
to
him
while
she
dwelt
on
the
mystery
of
his
divine
patience
and
felt
herself
filled
with
the
serene
intensity
of
his
holy
love
she
recalled
the
faultless
grace
and
beauty
of
his
person
and
revelled
in
the
thought
of
it
till
suddenly
a
deep
and
sensuous
glow
of
delight
in
him
flooded
her
being
and
her
very
soul
was
faint
for
him
she
called
him
by
name
caressingly
dear
lord
she
confessed
her
passionate
attachment
to
him
she
implored
him
to
look
upon
her
lovingly
she
offered
him
the
devotion
of
her
life
and
then
she
sank
into
a
perfect
stupor
of
ecstatic
contemplation
this
was
the
way
she
worshipped
dwelling
on
the
charms
of
his
person
and
character
with
the
same
senses
that
her
delicate
maiden
mind
still
shrank
from
devoting
to
an
earthly
lover
calling
him
what
she
would
have
had
her
husband
be
master
the
woman
ideal
of
perfect
bliss
a
strong
support
a
sure
refuge
praying
him
to
strengthen
her
to
make
her
wise
to
keep
her
pure
to
help
to
guide
to
comfort
her
and
finding
in
each
repetition
of
familiar
phrases
the
luxurious
gladness
of
a
great
enthusiasm
but
these
emotional
excesses
were
not
to
be
indulged
in
with
impunity
when
edith
arose
from
her
knees
she
had
already
begun
to
suffer
the
punishment
of
a
chilling
reaction
the
faded
from
her
face
the
glow
of
ecstatic
passion
was
extinguished
in
her
heart
the
festal
robes
of
enraptured
feeling
fell
from
her
consciousness
and
were
replaced
by
the
rags
of
unwelcome
recollections
she
thought
of
the
poor
delicate
little
french
girl
lying
by
the
wayside
exhausted
and
longed
to
know
if
she
were
at
that
moment
sheltering
in
the
workhouse
and
rested
and
restored
she
wondered
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
the
workhouse
alone
without
a
single
friend
to
speak
kindly
to
her
but
the
bare
thought
of
such
a
position
made
her
shudder
if
only
she
could
have
befriended
that
poor
creature
and
her
little
child
the
sweet
maternal
instinct
of
her
own
being
set
up
a
yearning
which
softened
her
heart
the
more
tenderly
toward
the
mother
because
of
the
child
she
did
so
wish
that
she
could
have
done
something
for
both
of
them
and
then
she
recollected
her
horrible
dream
and
began
involuntarily
to
piece
the
vision
of
the
morning
to
the
incident
of
the
afternoon
in
order
to
find
some
faint
foreshadowing
for
her
guidance
of
the
one
event
in
the
other
next
day
she
persuaded
her
mother
to
send
to
the
workhouse
directly
after
breakfast
to
ask
if
the
girl
had
been
taken
in
and
how
she
was
edwards
the
old
footman
could
have
told
his
mistress
the
girl
whole
history
and
she
knew
him
also
to
be
an
honest
man
of
simple
speech
not
given
to
exaggerate
but
she
scented
something
unpleasant
in
the
whole
affair
and
she
would
have
looked
coldly
for
the
rest
of
her
life
on
anyone
as
being
a
suspicious
character
who
had
ventured
to
suggest
that
she
should
make
herself
acquainted
with
the
details
of
such
a
case
she
considered
that
any
inquiries
of
that
kind
would
have
been
improper
to
the
last
degree
she
sent
edwards
to
the
workhouse
however
to
know
if
the
girl
had
been
found
and
when
he
brought
back
word
that
she
had
not
although
the
most
careful
search
for
her
had
been
made
in
the
neighbourhood
beale
concluded
that
she
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
continue
her
weary
tramp
and
very
gladly
dismissed
the
whole
matter
from
her
mind

had
been
steadily
making
each
acquaintance
colonel
colquhoun
had
met
evadne
on
board
the
steamer
on
her
arrival
and
had
found
her
enchanted
by
her
first
glimpse
of
the
place
and
too
girlishly
glad
in
the
excitement
of
change
the
bustle
and
movement
and
novelty
to
give
a
thought
to
anything
else
the
healthy
young
of
the
human
race
have
a
large
capacity
for
enjoyment
and
they
have
also
the
happy
knack
of
banishing
all
thought
which
threatens
to
be
an
interruption
to
pleasurable
sensation
when
a
thing
was
once
settled
it
was
disposition
to
have
done
with
it
and
since
she
had
come
to
satisfactory
terms
with
colonel
colquhoun
and
recovered
from
the
immediate
effects
of
the
painful
contest
the
matter
had
not
troubled
her
she
had
perfect
confidence
in
his
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
and
was
prepared
to
find
it
no
more
awkward
to
live
in
his
house
and
have
him
for
an
occasional
companion
than
it
would
to
be
a
guest
of
good
position
in
any
other
establishment
his
own
attitude
was
that
of
a
kind
of
pleased
curiosity
he
considered
their
bargain
a
thing
to
be
carried
out
to
the
letter
so
long
as
she
held
him
to
it
like
a
debt
of
honour
not
legally
binding
but
morally
and
he
was
prepared
with
gentlemanly
tack
to
keep
faith
without
further
discussion
of
the
subject
the
arrangement
did
not
trouble
him
at
all
it
was
original
and
therefore
somewhat
piquant
and
so
was
evadne
they
met
therefore
without
more
than
a
momentary
embarrassment
and
his
first
glimpse
of
her
fresh
young
face
flushed
with
excitement
and
full
of
intelligent
interest
and
of
unaffected
pleasure
in
everything
was
an
unexpected
revelation
of
yet
another
facet
of
her
manifold
nature
and
a
bright
one
too
what
a
pity
she
had
views
but
there
was
always
a
hope
the
determination
to
live
up
to
them
was
merely
an
infantile
disease
of
which
society
would
soon
cure
her
society
has
views
too
it
believes
all
it
hears
in
the
churches
without
feeling
at
all
bound
to
practise
any
inconvenient
precept
implied
in
the
faith
colonel
colquhoun
had
gone
out
on
a
government
steam
launch
to
meet
the
mail
as
soon
as
she
was
signalled
and
finding
evadne
on
deck
had
remained
there
with
her
watching
the
wonderful
panorama
of
the
place
gradually
unfolding
itself
he
showed
her
the
various
points
of
interest
as
they
came
along
and
she
smiled
silent
acknowledgments
of
the
courtesy
the
sun
was
just
dispelling
the
diaphanous
mists
of
early
morning
making
them
hang
luminous
a
moment
and
then
disperse
like
tinted
gauze
that
flutters
slowly
upward
in
a
breeze
and
vanishes
great
white
clouds
and
crisp
piled
themselves
up
fantastically
and
floated
off
also
leaving
the
deep
blue
vault
to
mirror
itself
in
the
answering
azure
of
the
sea
the
eternal
calm
above
awful
in
its
intensity
of
stillness
the
ceaseless
movement
below
a
type
of
life
throbbing
murmurous
changeful
more
interesting
than
more
to
be
wondered
at
than
revered
colonel
colquhoun
pointed
out
the
lighthouses
of
elmo
patron
saint
of
sailors
on
the
right
and
ricasoli
on
the
left
then
they
were
met
by
a
rainbow
fleet
of
dghaisas
gorgeous
in
colour
and
propelled
by
oarsmen
who
stood
to
their
work
and
were
also
brightly
clad
both
boats
and
boatmen
clothed
by
the
sun
as
it
were
having
blossomed
into
colour
unconsciously
as
the
flowers
do
in
genial
atmospheres
the
boats
carrying
fruits
flowers
tobacco
cheap
jewellery
and
coarse
clothing
for
sailors
each
cargo
adding
something
of
picturesqueness
to
the
scene
formed
a
gay
flotilla
about
the
steamer
and
accompanied
her
she
towering
majestically
above
them
and
appearing
to
attract
them
and
hold
them
to
her
sides
as
a
great
cork
in
the
water
does
a
handful
of
chopped
straw
the
boatman
held
up
their
wares
chattering
and
gesticulating
their
faces
all
animation
and
changeful
as
children
one
moment
they
would
be
smiling
up
and
speaking
in
wheedling
tones
to
the
passengers
and
the
next
they
would
be
frowning
round
at
each
other
and
resenting
some
offence
with
torrents
of
abuse
so
the
mail
glided
into
the
grand
harbour
evadne
wondering
at
the
fortifications
and
straining
her
eyes
to
make
out
somewhat
of
the
symbols
alternate
eye
and
ear
carved
on
the
old
watch
tower
of
angelo
noticing
too
the
sharp
outline
of
everything
in
the
pellucid
atmosphere
and
feeling
herself
suddenly
aglow
with
warmth
and
colour
a
part
of
the
marvellous
beauty
and
brightness
and
uplifted
in
spirit
out
of
the
everyday
world
above
all
thought
and
care
into
regions
of
the
purest
pleasure
what
a
lovely
place
she
exclaimed
it
looks
like
a
great
irregular
enchanted
palace
it
very
jolly
said
colonel
colquhoun
smiling
upon
the
scene
complacently
and
looking
as
important
as
if
he
were
himself
responsible
for
the
whole
arrangement
but
was
too
magnanimous
to
mention
the
fact
i
thought
you
like
it
but
wait
till
you
see
it
by
moonlight
we
come
off
and
dine
with
one
of
the
naval
fellows
some
night
i
sure
you
be
delighted
it
just
like
a
photograph
evadne
found
that
colonel
colquhoun
had
secured
a
good
house
for
her
and
had
bestowed
much
care
upon
the
arrangement
of
it
it
was
the
kind
of
occupation
in
which
he
delighted
and
he
did
it
well
he
showed
evadne
over
the
house
himself
as
soon
as
she
arrived
and
what
struck
her
as
most
delightful
were
the
flowers
and
foliage
plants
which
decorated
every
available
corner
and
nearly
all
growing
oranges
and
oleanders
in
great
tubs
and
palms
and
ferns
in
oriental
china
stands
and
in
majolica
vases
one
only
sees
it
so
for
a
ball
at
home
she
said
or
some
other
special
occasion
he
looked
at
her
keenly
a
moment
her
face
was
serenely
content
well
this
is
a
kind
of
a
special
occasion
with
me
he
said
rather
gloomily
he
went
on
as
he
spoke
evadne
following
him
from
room
to
room
pleased
with
everything
and
looking
it
which
is
a
much
more
convincing
token
of
appreciation
than
the
best
chosen
words
but
when
they
came
to
the
rooms
which
were
to
be
hers
she
was
quite
overcome
for
colonel
colquhoun
had
chosen
two
opening
into
each
other
as
nearly
as
possible
like
those
she
had
occupied
at
fraylingay
and
had
filled
them
with
all
the
beloved
possessions
books
pictures
and
ornaments
which
she
had
left
behind
her
how
good
you
are
how
very
good
you
are
she
exclaimed
impulsively
i
hope
we
shall
be
friends
oh
we
shall
be
friends
he
answered
with
affected
carelessness
but
really
well
pleased
i
thought
you
would
settle
better
if
you
had
your
own
pet
things
to
begin
with
i
had
a
great
fight
with
your
father
about
the
books
he
said
you
got
all
your
nonsense
out
of
them
but
i
suggested
that
it
might
be
a
case
of
a
little
learning
being
a
dangerous
thing
so
i
captured
all
the
old
ones
and
i
got
a
lot
more
for
you
see
here
zola
and
daudet
complete
and
george
sand
you
like
them
better
i
fancy
when
you
get
into
them
than
herbert
spencer
and
francis
galton
but
i
got
you
some
more
of
their
books
as
well
all
that
you
had
got
you
are
really
good
said
evadne
getting
her
the
books
was
like
putting
butter
on
the
paws
of
a
strange
cat
to
make
it
settle
she
sat
down
beside
them
and
began
to
take
off
her
gloves
at
once
colonel
colquhoun
smiled
beneath
his
blond
moustache
then
pleading
regimental
duty
left
her
to
her
treasures
assuring
himself
as
he
went
that
he
really
did
know
women
exceptional
or
otherwise
he
had
arranged
the
books
himself
placing
zola
and
daudet
in
prominent
positions
and
anticipating
much
entertainment
from
the
observation
of
their
effect
upon
her
he
expected
that
she
would
end
by
making
love
to
him
in
which
case
he
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
paying
her
off
by
acting
for
a
time
after
the
manner
proposed
by
the
barber
fifth
brother
when
they
met
again
evadne
had
read
her
mother
letter
and
she
at
once
took
him
into
her
confidence
about
it
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
me
she
asked
i
should
write
to
the
papers
he
answered
gravely
as
if
he
meant
it
he
did
not
at
all
understand
the
strong
simple
earnest
nature
incapable
of
flippancy
with
which
he
had
to
deal
nor
appreciate
the
danger
of
playing
with
it
and
he
never
dreamt
that
she
would
seriously
consider
the
suggestion
i
can
not
understand
why
my
father
should
continue
to
feel
vexed
about
this
arrangement
of
ours
she
said
seriously
we
do
not
interfere
with
his
domestic
affairs
why
should
he
meddle
with
ours
it
is
not
at
all
his
business
do
you
think
it
is
this
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
arrangement
was
as
satisfactory
to
him
as
it
was
to
her
and
appealing
to
him
in
good
faith
against
himself
and
his
own
interests
as
it
were
touched
colonel
colquhoun
sense
of
the
ludicrous
pleasurably
it
was
always
the
unexpected
apparently
that
was
likely
to
happen
with
evadne
and
he
appreciated
the
charm
of
the
unexpected
and
began
to
believe
he
should
find
more
entertainment
at
home
than
he
had
thought
possible
even
at
the
outset
of
his
matrimonial
venture
when
all
appeared
most
promising
he
got
on
very
well
with
her
father
but
nevertheless
when
it
had
at
last
dawned
upon
him
that
she
was
taking
his
suggestion
about
writing
to
the
papers
seriously
it
jumped
with
his
peculiar
sense
of
humour
which
had
never
developed
beyond
the
stage
into
which
it
had
blossomed
in
his
subaltern
days
to
egg
her
on
to
draw
the
testy
old
gentleman
by
threats
of
publicity
it
was
his
masculine
mind
therefore
that
was
really
responsible
for
her
unnatural
action
in
that
matter
in
bygone
days
when
there
was
any
mischief
afoot
the
principle
used
to
be
la
and
when
she
was
found
the
investigation
stopped
there
but
modern
methods
of
inquiry
are
unsatisfied
with
this
imperfect
search
and
insist
upon
looking
behind
the
woman
when
lo
invariably
there
appears
a
skulking
creature
of
the
opposite
sex
who
is
not
ashamed
to
be
concealed
by
the
petticoats
generously
spread
out
to
screen
him
while
the
world
approves
man
struts
and
crows
taking
all
the
credit
but
when
there
is
blame
about
he
whines
fashion
it
was
me
la
chapter
ii
beale
and
edith
arrived
in
malta
almost
immediately
after
evadne
herself
and
it
so
happened
that
the
latter
when
she
went
with
colonel
colquhoun
to
call
upon
them
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
drawing
room
most
of
the
people
to
whom
she
was
to
become
really
attached
during
her
sojourn
in
malta
there
were
sillenger
wife
of
the
colonel
of
one
of
the
other
regiments
stationed
on
the
island
malcomson
also
the
wife
of
a
military
man
the
rev
basil
john
a
man
of
good
family
pronounced
refinement
and
practices
and
austin
b
price
a
distinguished
american
diplomatist
and
man
of
letters
to
whom
she
became
specially
attached
beale
and
edith
also
were
from
that
time
forward
two
of
her
dearest
and
most
valued
friends
she
looked
very
charming
on
the
occasion
of
that
first
visit
beale
received
her
with
quite
effusive
kindliness
she
had
promised
orton
beg
to
be
a
mother
to
her
and
had
been
building
a
little
aerial
castle
wherein
she
saw
herself
installed
as
principal
adviser
comforter
confidential
friend
and
invaluable
help
generally
under
certain
circumstances
of
peculiar
trial
and
happy
interest
to
which
young
wives
are
subject
evadne
and
edith
looked
at
each
other
with
a
kind
of
pleased
surprise
how
tall
you
have
grown
said
evadne
and
how
young
you
are
to
be
married
edith
rejoined
i
was
so
glad
when
orton
beg
told
us
you
were
here
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
which
decided
us
to
come
i
think
i
hope
we
shall
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
said
evadne
that
would
be
delightful
edith
answered
then
suddenly
she
blushed
she
had
recognized
someone
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
evadne
narrowing
her
eyes
to
see
who
it
was
recognized
him
as
sir
mosley
menteith
a
captain
in
the
colquhoun
highlanders
whose
acquaintance
she
had
made
the
day
before
when
he
called
upon
her
for
the
first
time
he
shook
hands
with
beale
and
stood
talking
to
her
looking
down
at
her
intently
until
someone
else
claimed
her
attention
then
he
turned
away
rested
the
back
of
his
left
hand
in
which
he
was
holding
his
hat
on
his
haunch
fixed
an
eyeglass
in
his
eye
and
looked
round
with
an
expression
of
great
gravity
twirling
first
one
end
and
then
the
other
of
his
little
light
moustache
slowly
as
he
did
so
he
was
extremely
in
appearance
and
wore
kid
gloves
the
room
was
pretty
full
by
that
time
and
he
seemed
to
have
some
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
person
whom
he
sought
but
at
last
he
made
out
edith
and
evadne
sitting
together
and
going
over
to
them
greeted
them
both
and
then
took
a
vacant
chair
beside
them
he
began
by
inspecting
first
one
and
then
the
other
carefully
in
turn
as
if
he
were
comparing
them
point
by
point
uttering
little
remarks
the
while
of
so
thin
and
weak
a
nature
that
evadne
had
to
make
quite
an
effort
to
grasp
them
she
had
thawed
under
the
influence
of
edith
warm
frank
cordiality
but
now
she
froze
again
suddenly
and
began
to
have
disagreeable
thoughts
she
noticed
something
repellent
about
the
expression
of
sir
mosley
mouth
she
acknowleged
that
his
nose
was
good
but
his
eyes
were
small
peery
and
too
close
together
and
his
head
shelved
backward
like
an
ape
she
could
not
have
kept
up
a
conversation
with
him
had
she
wished
to
but
she
preferred
to
withdraw
herself
and
let
him
monopolize
edith
i
like
you
best
in
blue
sir
mosley
was
saying
will
you
wear
blue
at
our
dance
oh
no
edith
rejoined
archly
smiling
up
at
him
with
lips
and
eyes
i
have
worn
nothing
but
blue
lately
i
shall
soon
be
known
as
the
blue
girl
i
must
have
a
change
gray
and
pink
are
evidently
colours
evadne
evadne
looked
down
at
her
draperies
as
a
polite
intimation
that
she
had
heard
but
just
then
her
attention
was
diverted
by
the
conversation
of
two
ladies
and
a
gentleman
who
were
sitting
together
in
a
window
on
her
right
the
gentleman
was
john
the
ritualistic
divine
whose
face
with
its
firm
mouth
finely
formed
nose
with
sensitive
nostrils
and
kindly
dark
eyes
attracted
her
at
once
he
was
very
fragile
in
appearance
and
had
a
troublesome
cough
ah
mrs
malcomson
he
was
saying
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
see
the
old
exquisite
ideal
of
womanhood
disturbed
by
these
new
notions
what
can
be
more
admirable
more
elevating
to
contemplate
more
powerful
as
an
example
than
her
beautiful
submission
to
the
hardships
of
her
lot
or
less
effectual
seeing
that
no
good
but
rather
the
contrary
has
come
of
it
all
malcomson
answered
that
is
the
poetry
of
the
pulpit
and
the
logic
too
i
may
add
she
said
leaning
back
in
her
chair
luxuriously
for
what
could
be
less
effectual
for
good
than
the
influence
has
been
of
those
women
poor
wingless
creatures
of
the
whose
ideal
of
duty
rises
no
higher
than
silent
abject
submission
to
all
the
worst
vices
we
know
to
be
inseparable
from
the
unchecked
habitual
possession
of
despotic
authority
what
do
you
say
mrs
sillenger
the
other
lady
smiled
agreement
she
was
older
than
malcomson
and
otherwise
presented
a
contrast
to
the
latter
being
taller
slighter
with
a
prettier
sweeter
and
altogether
more
womanly
face
as
some
people
said
a
stranger
might
have
thought
that
she
had
less
character
too
but
that
was
not
the
case
she
suffered
neither
from
weakness
nor
want
of
decision
but
her
manner
was
more
diffident
and
she
said
less
malcomson
belonged
to
a
somewhat
different
order
of
being
she
had
a
strong
and
handsome
face
with
regular
features
a
proud
mouth
slightly
sarcastic
in
expression
and
dark
gray
eyes
given
to
glow
with
fiery
enthusiasm
her
hair
was
dark
brown
but
showed
those
shades
of
red
in
certain
lights
which
betoken
an
energetic
temperament
and
good
staying
power
it
was
crisp
and
broke
into
little
natural
curls
on
her
forehead
and
neck
or
wherever
it
could
escape
from
bondage
but
she
had
not
much
of
it
and
it
was
usually
rather
picturesque
than
tidy
sillenger
on
the
contrary
was
straight
and
luxuriant
and
always
neat
it
had
been
light
in
her
youth
but
was
somewhat
faded
malcomson
spoke
as
well
as
she
looked
the
resonant
tones
of
her
rich
contralto
voice
pleasing
the
ear
more
than
her
opinions
startled
the
understanding
she
owed
half
her
success
in
life
to
the
careful
management
of
her
voice
by
simple
modulations
of
it
she
could
always
differ
from
an
opponent
without
giving
personal
offence
and
she
seldom
provoked
bitter
opposition
because
nothing
she
said
ever
sounded
aggressive
if
she
had
not
been
a
good
woman
she
would
have
been
a
dangerous
one
since
she
could
please
eye
and
ear
at
will
a
knack
which
obtains
more
concessions
from
the
average
man
than
the
best
chosen
arguments
it
seems
to
me
that
your
of
the
pulpit
is
very
mischievous
she
pursued
you
have
pleased
our
senses
with
it
for
ages
you
have
flattered
us
into
in
action
by
it
and
used
it
as
a
means
to
stimulate
our
vanity
and
indolence
by
extolling
a
helpless
condition
under
the
pompous
title
of
patient
submission
you
have
administered
soothing
sedatives
of
consolation
as
you
call
it
under
the
baleful
influence
of
which
we
have
existed
with
all
our
highest
faculties
dulled
and
drugged
you
have
curtailed
our
grand
power
to
resist
evil
by
narrowing
us
down
to
what
you
call
the
sphere
wherein
you
insist
that
we
shall
be
unconditional
slaves
of
man
doing
always
and
only
such
things
as
shall
suit
his
pleasure
and
convenience
ah
but
when
you
remember
that
the
law
which
man
delivers
to
woman
he
receives
direct
from
god
you
must
confess
that
that
alters
the
whole
aspect
of
the
argument
john
deprecated
i
confess
that
it
would
alter
it
if
it
were
true
malcomson
replied
but
it
is
not
true
man
does
not
deliver
the
law
of
god
to
us
but
the
law
of
his
own
inclinations
and
by
assuming
to
himself
the
right
among
other
things
of
undisputed
authority
over
us
he
has
held
the
best
half
of
the
conscience
of
the
race
in
abeyance
until
now
and
so
checked
the
general
progress
he
has
confirmed
himself
in
his
own
worst
vices
arrogance
egotism
injustice
and
greed
and
has
developed
the
worst
in
us
also
among
which
i
class
that
tendency
to
sycophantic
adulation
which
is
an
effort
of
nature
to
secure
the
necessaries
of
life
for
ourselves
but
women
generally
do
not
think
that
any
change
for
the
better
is
necessary
in
their
position
they
are
satisfied
john
observed
smiling
women
generally
are
fools
malcomson
ruefully
confessed
and
the
generally
to
whom
you
allude
as
being
satisfied
are
the
women
well
off
in
this
world
goods
themselves
who
do
think
for
others
the
first
symptom
of
deep
thought
in
a
woman
is
dissatisfaction
i
wonder
men
like
yourself
john
sillenger
began
in
her
quiet
diffident
way
continue
so
prejudiced
on
this
subject
how
you
could
help
on
the
moral
progress
of
the
world
if
only
you
would
forget
the
sweet
soporific
of
the
pulpit
as
malcomson
calls
it
and
learn
to
think
of
us
women
not
as
angels
or
beasts
of
burden
the
two
extremes
between
which
you
wander
but
as
human
beings
oh
he
protested
interrupting
her
i
hope
i
have
not
made
you
imagine
that
i
do
not
recognize
certain
grave
injustices
to
which
women
are
at
present
subject
those
i
as
earnestly
hope
to
see
remedied
as
you
do
but
what
i
do
think
objectionable
is
the
way
in
which
women
are
putting
themselves
forward
you
are
right
there
said
sillenger
i
think
myself
that
men
might
be
allowed
to
continue
to
monopolize
the
right
of
impudent
but
do
not
lend
yourself
to
the
silencing
system
any
longer
john
malcomson
implored
the
silent
acquiescence
of
women
in
an
iniquitous
state
of
things
is
merely
an
indication
of
the
sensual
apathy
to
which
your
ruinous
of
the
pulpit
has
reduced
the
greater
number
of
us
i
quite
agree
with
you
evadne
exclaimed
then
stopped
colouring
crimson
she
had
forgotten
in
her
interest
that
she
was
a
stranger
to
these
people
and
only
remembered
it
when
they
all
looked
at
her
rather
blankly
as
she
imagined
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
addressing
malcomson
i
could
not
help
overhearing
the
discussion
and
i
am
deeply
interested
i
am
colquhoun
she
broke
off
covered
with
confusion
oh
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
malcomson
said
warmly
i
called
on
you
on
my
way
here
but
you
were
out
and
so
did
i
said
sillenger
and
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
very
soon
john
added
bowing
beale
joined
the
group
just
then
you
have
been
talking
so
merrily
in
this
corner
she
said
sitting
down
on
a
high
chair
as
she
spoke
i
have
been
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
rights
malcomson
uttered
in
deeply
tragic
tones
woman
rights
oh
dear
me
how
dreadful
beale
exclaimed
comfortably
i
wo
hear
a
word
on
the
subject
not
on
the
subject
of
cooking
said
malcomson
what
has
cooking
to
do
with
it
beale
asked
why
everything
malcomson
answered
smiling
if
only
john
and
a
few
other
very
good
men
would
stand
up
in
their
pulpits
boldly
and
assure
those
who
dread
innovation
that
their
food
will
be
the
better
cooked
and
the
itself
will
roll
along
all
the
more
smoothly
for
the
changes
we
find
necessary
there
would
be
an
end
of
their
opposition
i
would
not
promise
women
cooks
for
i
really
think
myself
that
the
men
are
superior
they
put
so
much
more
feeling
into
it
and
i
can
never
understand
why
they
do
not
quarrel
with
us
for
the
possession
of
that
department
i
am
sure
we
are
quite
ready
to
resign
it
and
really
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
it
is
obvious
that
the
kitchen
is
much
more
the
man
sphere
than
the
woman
for
it
is
there
that
his
heart
is
you
beguile
me
my
dear
beale
said
smiling
but
i
will
not
listen
to
your
wicked
railleries
she
looked
at
sillenger
i
came
to
ask
you
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
play
us
something
she
said
sillinger
was
a
perfect
musician
and
as
evadne
listened
her
heart
expanded
when
the
music
ceased
she
looked
up
and
about
her
blankly
like
one
who
is
bewildered
by
the
sudden
discovery
of
an
unexpected
loss
and
with
that
expression
still
upon
her
face
she
met
the
bright
penetrating
kindly
eye
of
a
small
thin
elderly
gentleman
with
refined
features
a
wrinkled
forehead
and
thick
gray
hair
who
was
looking
at
her
so
fixedly
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
at
first
her
own
glance
fell
but
the
next
moment
she
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
look
at
him
again
the
attraction
was
mutual
he
got
up
at
once
from
the
low
ottoman
on
which
he
was
sitting
and
came
across
to
her
and
she
welcomed
his
approach
with
a
smile
excuse
the
liberty
of
an
old
man
who
has
not
been
introduced
he
said
you
are
colquhoun
i
know
and
my
name
is
price
i
am
an
american
and
i
came
to
europe
on
official
business
for
my
country
first
of
all
but
i
am
now
travelling
for
my
own
pleasure
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
evadne
answered
before
they
could
say
another
word
to
each
other
however
there
was
a
general
move
of
guests
departing
and
colonel
colquhoun
came
to
carry
her
off
she
held
out
her
hand
to
price
we
shall
meet
again
she
said
with
your
permission
i
will
call
he
answered
chapter
iii
john
and
price
were
staying
at
the
same
hotel
and
they
walked
back
to
it
together
they
had
only
just
made
each
other
acquaintance
and
were
feeling
the
attraction
which
there
is
in
a
common
object
pursued
by
the
most
dissimilar
means
they
were
both
humanitarians
price
by
choice
and
of
set
purpose
john
of
necessity
seeing
that
he
was
a
good
man
but
unconsciously
the
consequence
being
much
confusion
of
mind
on
the
subject
and
a
wide
difference
between
his
words
and
his
deeds
he
preached
for
instance
the
degrading
doctrine
that
we
ought
to
be
miserable
in
this
world
that
all
our
wonderful
powers
of
enjoyment
were
only
given
to
us
to
be
suppressed
and
further
blasphemed
our
sacred
humanity
by
maintaining
that
we
are
born
in
sin
and
sinners
we
must
remain
fight
as
we
will
to
release
ourselves
from
that
bondage
but
yet
his
whole
life
was
spent
in
trying
to
make
his
better
and
the
world
itself
a
pleasanter
place
to
live
in
the
means
which
he
employed
however
was
the
old
anodyne
believe
the
best
that
is
to
say
cultivate
agreeable
feelings
price
motto
on
the
other
hand
was
know
the
worst
the
foe
must
be
known
must
be
recognized
must
be
met
and
fought
in
the
open
if
he
is
to
be
subdued
at
all
this
was
the
difference
which
drew
the
two
together
each
felt
the
deepest
interest
in
the
point
where
the
other
diverged
and
yearned
to
convert
him
to
his
own
way
of
thought
price
would
have
had
the
clergyman
know
the
world
john
would
have
taught
price
to
ignore
it
to
look
up
as
he
called
it
or
in
other
words
to
sit
and
sigh
for
heaven
while
the
heathen
raged
and
the
wicked
went
their
way
here
undisturbed
although
he
had
not
realized
up
to
the
present
that
that
was
practically
what
his
system
amounted
to
he
belonged
by
birth
to
the
caste
which
is
vowed
to
the
policy
of
ignoring
and
was
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
about
delicate
matters
nationally
price
was
the
son
and
had
advanced
a
generation
men
are
what
women
choose
to
make
them
john
mother
was
the
best
kind
of
woman
of
the
old
order
price
was
the
product
of
the
new
and
the
two
were
typical
representatives
of
the
chivalry
of
the
past
unforeseeing
and
the
chivalry
of
the
present
which
reaches
on
always
into
futurity
with
the
long
arm
of
knowledge
not
deceiving
itself
with
romantic
misrepresentations
of
things
by
the
way
but
fully
recognizing
what
is
wrong
from
the
outset
and
making
direct
for
the
root
of
the
evil
instead
of
contenting
itself
by
lopping
a
branch
here
and
there
i
think
you
said
you
were
going
to
winter
here
price
remarked
as
they
stepped
into
the
street
yes
if
the
place
suits
me
john
answered
and
so
far
that
is
to
say
for
the
last
month
it
has
done
so
very
well
are
you
a
resident
well
no
not
exactly
the
old
gentleman
answered
but
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
for
years
it
is
an
interesting
place
said
john
teeming
with
historical
associations
yes
it
is
an
interesting
place
price
agreed
making
a
little
pause
before
he
added
full
of
food
for
reflection
life
at
large
is
represented
at
malta
during
the
winter
season
and
in
a
little
place
like
this
humanity
is
under
the
microscope
as
it
were
which
makes
it
a
happy
hunting
ground
for
those
who
have
to
know
the
world
ah
john
ejaculated
deliberately
i
should
think
there
are
some
very
nice
people
here
yes
and
some
very
nasty
ones
price
rejoined
but
of
course
one
must
know
both
oh
i
differ
from
you
there
john
answered
smiling
walk
not
in
sinners
way
you
know
on
the
contrary
i
should
say
price
rejoined
smiling
responsively
and
twitching
his
nose
as
if
a
gnat
had
tickled
it
but
i
allow
you
have
got
to
have
a
good
excuse
when
you
do
john
smiled
again
slightly
but
said
nothing
there
were
elephants
once
in
malta
i
am
told
he
began
after
a
little
pause
changing
the
subject
adroitly
but
they
dwindled
down
from
the
size
which
makes
them
so
useful
by
way
of
comparison
till
they
were
no
bigger
than
shetland
ponies
before
they
finally
became
extinct
and
there
is
a
set
in
society
on
the
island
now
price
pursued
formed
of
representatives
of
old
english
houses
that
once
brought
men
of
notable
size
and
virile
into
the
world
but
are
now
only
equal
to
the
production
of
curious
survivals
tending
surely
to
extinction
like
the
elephant
and
by
an
analogous
process
here
we
are
said
john
as
they
arrived
at
their
place
of
abode
will
you
come
to
my
room
and
smoke
a
cigarette
with
me
thank
you
i
do
smoke
but
i
go
to
your
room
and
see
you
smoke
one
with
pleasure
price
responded
when
they
got
to
john
room
the
latter
took
off
his
clerical
coat
and
waistcoat
and
put
on
a
coloured
smoking
jacket
which
had
the
curious
effect
of
transforming
him
from
an
ascetic
looking
high
churchman
into
what
from
his
refined
intellectual
face
and
rather
long
straight
hair
most
people
would
have
mistaken
for
an
actor
suffering
from
overwork
having
provided
price
with
a
comfortable
seat
in
the
window
which
was
open
he
lighted
a
cigarette
drew
up
another
and
stretched
himself
out
in
it
luxuriously
he
was
easily
fatigued
at
that
time
and
the
rest
and
quiet
were
grateful
after
the
talk
and
crowd
at
beale
there
was
a
little
wooden
balcony
outside
his
window
full
of
flowers
and
foliage
plants
and
from
where
he
sat
he
saw
the
people
passing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
below
and
could
also
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
mediterranean
appearing
between
the
yellow
houses
at
the
end
of
the
street
intensely
blue
and
sparkling
in
the
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
it
was
altogether
a
soothing
scene
and
had
he
been
alone
he
would
have
sunk
into
that
state
of
intellectual
apathy
which
is
so
often
miscalled
contemplative
the
homely
duties
of
hospitality
however
compelled
him
to
exert
himself
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guest
several
of
the
people
they
had
just
met
at
beale
went
past
together
laughing
and
talking
and
of
this
he
remarked
it
a
bright
little
world
yes
on
the
smoothly
smiling
surface
of
society
i
allow
it
bright
price
rejoined
the
surface
however
is
but
a
small
part
of
it
john
took
a
whiff
of
his
cigarette
do
you
see
that
man
price
pursued
indicating
a
man
below
the
middle
height
with
broad
shoulders
a
black
beard
and
moustache
streaked
with
brown
a
ruddy
complexion
and
obtrusively
blue
eyes
who
was
passing
at
the
moment
captain
belliot
of
john
answered
using
the
ship
nickname
and
holding
out
his
cigarette
between
his
finger
and
thumb
as
he
spoke
his
fluent
patrician
english
losing
in
significance
what
it
gained
in
melody
compared
with
the
slow
dry
intonation
of
the
american
yes
sir
price
rejoined
now
he
is
one
of
the
survivals
i
just
now
mentioned
a
typical
specimen
i
rather
like
the
man
john
answered
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
but
he
pleasant
enough
to
meet
just
so
price
rejoined
the
manners
of
the
kind
are
agreeable
on
the
surface
one
must
give
the
devil
his
due
but
on
closer
acquaintance
you
wo
find
that
their
general
characteristics
are
exactly
pleasant
their
minds
are
hopelessly
tainted
with
exhalations
from
the
literary
sewer
which
streams
from
france
throughout
the
world
and
their
habits
are
not
nicer
than
their
books
ah
well
said
john
whose
sensitive
lip
had
curled
in
dislike
of
the
subject
it
is
never
too
late
to
mend
i
believe
too
that
the
evil
is
exaggerated
but
at
all
events
they
repent
and
marry
and
become
respectable
men
eventually
well
yes
sir
they
marry
as
a
rule
price
rejoined
and
the
worst
of
it
john
held
his
cigarette
poised
in
the
air
on
the
way
to
his
mouth
and
looked
at
him
interrogatively
will
what
you
call
repentance
restore
a
rotten
constitution
price
responded
will
it
prevent
a
drunkard
children
from
being
weakly
vicious
or
the
daughters
of
a
licentious
man
from
being
foredoomed
to
destruction
by
an
inherited
appetite
for
the
vices
which
you
seem
to
flatter
yourself
end
in
effect
when
they
are
repented
of
you
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
once
vicious
man
becomes
the
father
of
vicious
children
and
the
grandfather
of
criminals
you
persuade
women
to
marry
these
men
the
arrangement
is
perfect
man
safety
and
pleasure
if
there
is
any
sin
in
it
the
she
weak
she
ca
retaliate
john
cigarette
went
out
he
had
begun
to
think
these
are
horrors
he
ejaculated
but
i
know
thank
heaven
that
the
right
feeling
of
the
community
is
against
the
perpetration
of
them
that
so
said
the
american
unfortunately
it
is
not
with
the
right
feeling
of
the
community
but
with
the
wrong
feeling
of
individuals
that
women
have
to
deal
heaven
forbid
that
women
should
ever
know
anything
about
it
i
say
so
too
said
price
at
present
however
heaven
permits
them
by
the
thousand
to
make
painful
personal
acquaintance
with
the
subject
and
i
assure
you
sir
that
the
indignation
which
has
long
been
simmering
in
whispers
over
tea
tables
in
the
seclusion
of
scented
boudoirs
amongst
those
same
delicate
dames
whom
you
have
it
in
your
mind
to
keep
in
ignorance
of
the
source
of
most
of
their
sufferings
mental
and
physical
is
fast
approaching
the
boiling
point
of
rebellion
do
you
know
this
for
a
fact
i
do
and
the
time
is
at
hand
i
think
for
a
thorough
ventilation
of
the
subject
it
is
the
question
of
all
others
which
must
either
be
ignored
until
society
is
disintegrated
by
the
licence
that
attitude
allows
or
considered
openly
and
seriously
that
is
why
i
mentioned
it
i
see
in
you
every
inclination
to
help
and
defend
the
suffering
sex
and
every
quality
except
the
habit
of
handling
facts
the
subject
repulsive
enough
i
allow
people
shrink
in
disgust
even
from
what
is
their
obvious
duty
in
the
matter
and
shirk
it
upon
various
pretexts
visiting
their
own
pain
like
when
she
boxed
the
ears
of
the
doctor
boy
upon
the
most
boxable
person
they
can
reach
and
that
is
generally
the
one
who
has
forced
their
attention
to
it
there
was
a
pause
after
this
then
the
clergyman
observed
one
knows
that
there
are
sores
which
must
be
exposed
to
view
if
they
are
to
be
prescribed
for
at
all
or
treated
with
any
chance
of
success
yes
yes
that
is
just
it
price
exclaimed
you
will
perceive
if
you
reflect
for
a
moment
that
there
must
have
been
a
good
deal
that
was
disagreeable
in
the
cleansing
of
the
augean
stables
to
which
people
in
the
neighbourhood
would
certainly
and
very
naturally
object
at
the
time
but
it
has
since
been
pretty
generally
conceded
that
the
undertaking
was
a
very
good
sanitary
measure
nevertheless
and
had
hercules
lived
in
our
day
and
survived
the
shower
of
stones
with
which
he
was
sure
to
have
been
encouraged
during
his
conduct
of
the
business
we
should
doubtless
have
given
him
a
dinner
or
in
the
other
case
an
epitaph
at
least
but
there
is
work
for
the
strong
man
still
the
augean
stable
of
our
modern
civilization
must
be
cleansed
and
it
is
a
more
difficult
task
than
the
other
was
and
one
to
put
him
on
his
mettle
and
win
him
great
renown
because
it
is
held
to
be
impossible
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
looked
at
john
with
concern
as
the
latter
struggled
with
a
bad
fit
of
coughing
i
am
afraid
i
have
talked
too
much
for
your
strength
he
added
oh
no
john
answered
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
on
the
contrary
i
assure
you
you
have
taken
me
out
of
myself
and
that
is
always
good
must
you
go
i
must
thank
you
do
rise
but
john
had
risen
and
was
surprised
to
find
himself
towering
over
the
little
gentleman
as
they
shook
hands
a
feeling
which
recurred
to
him
always
afterward
when
they
met
there
being
about
price
the
something
that
makes
the
impression
of
size
and
strength
and
courage
which
is
usually
only
associated
with
physical
force
chapter
iv
next
day
there
was
an
afternoon
dance
on
board
captain
belliot
ship
facetiously
for
no
particular
reason
and
evadne
was
there
with
colonel
colquhoun
she
was
dressed
in
white
heavily
trimmed
with
gold
and
being
a
bride
was
an
object
of
special
attention
and
interest
it
was
the
first
entertainment
of
the
kind
she
had
appeared
at
since
her
arrival
and
not
having
a
scrap
of
morbid
sentiment
about
her
she
was
prepared
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
but
in
her
own
way
of
course
which
as
she
was
new
to
the
place
and
the
people
would
naturally
be
a
very
quiet
observant
way
captain
belliot
received
her
when
she
came
on
board
and
they
shook
hands
she
was
taller
than
he
was
and
looking
down
at
him
while
in
the
act
noticed
the
streaks
of
brown
in
his
black
beard
his
skin
tight
as
a
gooseberry
and
his
obtrusively
blue
eyes
queen
weather
he
remarked
yes
she
answered
looking
out
at
the
sparkling
water
it
a
pretty
place
he
continued
yes
she
agreed
glancing
toward
the
shore
but
seeing
only
with
the
mind
eye
her
pupils
dilated
however
as
she
recalled
the
way
she
had
come
the
narrow
picturesque
steep
streets
almost
all
well
worn
with
high
irregular
houses
on
either
side
yellow
with
green
wooden
verandas
jutting
out
the
wharf
on
which
they
had
waited
a
moment
for
the
boat
to
take
them
off
and
the
maltese
ruffians
with
their
brown
faces
and
brightly
coloured
clothing
lying
idly
about
in
the
sun
or
chattering
together
at
the
top
of
their
voices
in
little
groups
they
had
seemed
to
look
at
her
too
with
friendly
eyes
and
she
saw
the
sapphire
sea
which
parted
in
dazzling
white
foam
from
the
prow
of
the
boat
as
they
came
along
saw
the
steady
sweep
of
the
oars
rising
and
falling
rhythmically
the
flash
of
the
blades
in
the
sunshine
the
faces
of
the
men
who
looked
at
her
shyly
but
with
the
same
look
which
she
took
to
be
friendly
and
their
smart
uniforms
she
would
liked
to
have
shaken
hands
with
them
all
and
there
was
more
still
in
her
mind
when
captain
belliot
asked
her
if
she
thought
the
place
pretty
yet
all
she
found
for
answer
was
the
one
word
yes
and
he
being
no
physiognomist
rashly
concluded
that
was
all
she
had
in
her
do
you
dance
he
proceeded
making
one
more
effort
to
induce
her
to
entertain
him
not
in
the
afternoon
she
said
sir
mosley
menteith
tried
next
you
come
from
morningquest
do
you
not
he
asked
looking
into
her
eyes
my
people
live
near
morningquest
she
answered
ah
then
i
suppose
you
know
everybody
there
he
observed
looking
hard
at
her
brooch
she
reflected
a
moment
then
answered
deliberately
not
by
any
means
i
should
think
it
is
a
large
neighbourhood
he
twisted
each
side
of
his
little
light
moustache
and
changed
the
subject
inspecting
her
figure
as
he
did
so
do
you
ride
he
asked
yes
she
said
there
was
a
pause
during
which
she
noticed
a
suspicion
of
powder
on
his
face
and
he
felt
dissatisfied
because
she
did
seem
to
be
going
to
entertain
him
the
band
struck
up
a
waltz
do
you
dance
he
said
looking
down
from
her
face
to
her
feet
not
in
the
afternoon
she
answered
the
dance
had
begun
and
a
pair
came
whirling
down
toward
them
evadne
moved
back
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
menteith
looking
round
for
a
partner
saw
guthrie
brimston
opposite
smiling
at
him
he
went
over
to
her
well
what
do
you
make
of
the
bride
she
asked
her
conversation
is
not
exactly
animated
he
answered
looking
into
guthrie
brimston
face
intently
she
was
a
round
woman
short
in
the
body
and
and
she
had
a
trick
of
wagging
her
skirts
and
perking
at
a
man
when
talking
to
him
she
did
so
now
nodding
and
smiling
in
a
way
that
made
her
speech
piquant
with
the
suggestion
that
she
thought
or
knew
a
great
deal
more
than
she
meant
to
say
you
have
made
her
acquaintance
i
suppose
menteith
added
oh
yes
she
answered
her
husband
is
an
old
friend
of
ours
you
know
so
bobbie
thought
we
ought
to
call
at
once
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
suggested
that
she
and
bobbie
merely
meant
to
tolerate
colquhoun
for
her
husband
sake
bobbie
was
major
guthrie
brimston
a
very
useful
little
man
to
his
wife
by
way
of
reference
when
she
wanted
to
say
a
smart
thing
which
might
or
might
not
be
considered
objectionable
according
to
the
taste
of
the
person
she
addressed
and
she
very
often
did
she
always
presented
it
as
a
quotation
from
him
bobbie
thinks
she
added
now
that
if
there
were
an
order
of
the
silent
sewing
machine
colquhoun
would
be
sure
to
be
a
distinguished
member
of
it
a
royal
personage
whom
evadne
had
met
at
home
recognized
her
at
this
moment
and
shook
hands
with
her
with
somewhat
effusive
cordiality
making
a
remark
to
which
she
responded
quietly
she
seems
to
be
a
pretty
young
woman
too
menteith
observed
her
composure
is
perfect
ah
guthrie
brimston
ejaculated
those
stupid
people
have
no
nerves
now
should
shake
all
over
in
such
a
position
the
band
played
the
next
few
bars
hard
and
fast
the
dancers
whirled
like
teetotums
then
stopped
with
the
final
crash
of
the
instruments
and
separated
scattering
the
groups
of
onlookers
who
themselves
into
new
combinations
immediately
guthrie
brimston
leaned
against
the
bulwarks
colonel
beston
of
the
artillery
and
colonel
colquhoun
joined
her
also
her
bobbie
and
menteith
remained
the
conversation
was
animated
evadne
having
moved
could
now
hear
every
word
of
it
and
thought
it
extremely
stupid
it
was
all
what
he
said
and
she
said
what
they
ought
to
have
said
and
what
they
really
meant
guthrie
brimston
made
some
cutting
remarks
she
talked
to
all
the
men
at
once
and
they
appeared
to
appreciate
her
sallies
but
their
own
replies
were
vapid
she
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
of
the
party
with
any
wit
beston
joined
her
she
was
a
little
dark
woman
with
a
patient
anxious
face
and
eyes
that
wandered
incessantly
till
she
discovered
her
husband
with
guthrie
brimston
evadne
surprised
the
glance
entreating
reproachful
loving
helpless
what
was
it
the
look
of
a
woman
who
finds
it
a
relief
to
know
the
worst
evadne
heart
began
to
contract
the
girlish
gladness
went
out
of
her
eyes
beale
and
edith
arrived
and
joined
her
and
menteith
came
and
attached
himself
to
them
at
once
you
put
on
the
blue
frock
he
said
softly
to
edith
looking
down
at
her
with
animal
eyes
and
a
flush
partly
of
gratified
vanity
on
his
face
edith
smiled
and
blushed
she
could
not
reason
about
him
her
wits
had
forsaken
her
that
a
case
i
think
said
guthrie
brimston
several
more
men
had
joined
her
by
this
time
and
they
all
looked
across
at
edith
and
menteith
half
the
men
on
the
island
took
their
opinions
especially
of
the
women
from
guthrie
brimston
she
was
forever
lowering
her
own
sex
in
their
estimation
and
they
with
docility
bowed
to
her
dictates
and
never
dreamt
of
judging
for
themselves
price
persuaded
john
to
come
and
look
on
at
the
dance
they
were
leaning
now
against
the
bulwarks
beside
guthrie
brimston
who
tried
to
absorb
them
into
her
circle
but
found
them
heavy
price
despised
her
and
john
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
he
had
passed
the
night
in
painful
reflection
and
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
he
was
more
than
half
convinced
that
price
had
not
exaggerated
but
now
with
the
smiling
surface
of
society
under
observation
and
his
senses
both
soothed
and
exhilarated
by
the
animated
scene
and
the
lively
music
he
could
not
believe
it
he
had
thought
for
the
moment
that
the
old
american
minister
was
a
strong
and
disinterested
philanthropist
but
now
he
saw
in
him
only
the
victim
of
a
diseased
imagination
the
habit
of
seeing
society
through
a
haze
of
feeling
as
it
should
be
was
older
than
the
american
entreaties
that
he
should
learn
to
know
it
as
it
is
and
he
deliberately
chose
to
be
unconvinced
the
person
is
casting
covetous
eyes
at
the
bishop
pretty
ewe
lamb
colonel
beston
observed
to
guthrie
brimston
a
kind
of
bower
had
been
made
of
the
stern
sheets
by
screening
them
off
from
the
main
deck
with
an
awning
and
from
out
of
this
a
lady
a
young
widow
stepped
just
at
this
moment
followed
by
a
young
man
they
had
been
out
of
sight
together
innocently
occupied
leaning
over
watching
the
fish
darting
about
down
in
the
depths
of
the
transparent
water
the
moment
they
appeared
however
the
men
about
guthrie
brimston
exchanged
glances
of
unmistakable
significance
and
the
young
widow
perceiving
this
flushed
crimson
with
indignation
guilty
conscience
major
guthrie
brimston
remarked
upon
this
with
a
chuckle
john
had
witnessed
the
incident
and
overheard
the
remark
and
the
import
of
both
forced
itself
upon
his
attention
price
words
recurred
to
him
you
are
right
he
remarked
they
are
gross
of
nature
these
people
the
animal
in
them
predominates
at
present
but
the
spiritual
the
immortal
part
is
there
too
it
must
be
it
has
not
been
cultivated
and
therefore
it
is
undeveloped
we
should
direct
our
whole
energies
to
the
cultivation
of
it
it
is
a
serious
subject
for
thought
and
prayer
price
twitched
his
nose
and
studied
the
physiognomies
about
him
i
doubt
myself
if
the
spiritual
nature
has
been
as
generally
diffused
as
you
seem
to
imagine
he
remarked
in
his
crisp
dry
way
but
if
the
germ
of
it
is
anywhere
it
is
in
the
women
help
them
out
of
their
difficulties
and
you
will
help
the
world
at
large
now
there
is
one
indicating
evadne
who
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
still
quietly
observant
i
was
looking
at
her
john
broke
in
she
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
those
sensitive
creatures
affected
by
sun
and
wind
and
rain
and
all
atmospheric
influences
to
their
joy
or
sorrow
who
will
suffer
a
martyrdom
in
secret
with
beautiful
womanly
endurance
and
be
very
much
to
blame
for
it
price
interrupted
that
is
your
idea
of
her
character
now
mine
is
different
i
should
say
that
she
is
a
being
so
nicely
balanced
so
human
that
either
senses
or
intellect
might
be
tipped
up
by
the
fraction
of
an
ounce
which
is
right
surely
since
the
senses
are
instrumental
in
sustaining
nature
while
the
intellect
helps
it
to
perfection
and
as
to
her
beautiful
womanly
endurance
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
the
palms
of
his
hands
upward
i
know
of
course
but
i
am
no
judge
of
character
if
she
does
not
prove
to
be
one
of
the
new
women
who
are
just
appearing
among
us
with
a
higher
ideal
of
duty
than
any
which
men
have
constructed
for
women
i
expect
she
will
be
ready
to
resent
as
an
insult
every
attempt
to
impose
unnecessary
suffering
either
upon
herself
or
her
sex
at
large
well
i
hope
she
will
not
become
a
contentious
woman
john
said
the
way
in
which
women
are
putting
themselves
forward
just
now
on
any
subject
which
happens
to
attract
their
attention
is
quite
deplorable
i
think
and
pushing
themselves
into
the
professions
too
and
entering
into
rivalry
with
men
generally
you
must
confess
that
all
that
is
unwomanly
it
seems
to
me
to
depend
entirely
upon
how
it
is
done
price
answered
judicially
and
i
deny
the
rivalry
all
that
women
ask
is
to
be
allowed
to
earn
their
bread
honestly
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
majority
of
men
would
rather
see
them
on
the
streets
the
old
gentleman
stopped
and
compressed
his
lips
into
a
sort
of
smile
i
can
see
he
said
that
you
are
dissenting
from
every
word
i
say
but
i
am
not
disheartened
i
feel
sure
that
the
scales
will
fall
from
your
eyes
some
day
and
then
you
will
look
back
and
see
clearly
for
yourself
the
way
in
which
all
moral
progress
has
been
checked
for
ages
by
the
criminal
repression
of
women
repression
of
women
exclaimed
captain
belliot
who
caught
the
words
just
as
the
band
stopped
good
lord
i
beg
your
pardon
john
but
it
a
subject
i
feel
very
strongly
upon
it
impossible
to
tell
what
the
devil
women
will
be
at
next
why
i
went
into
a
hotel
in
devonport
for
a
brandy
and
soda
just
before
i
sailed
and
i
happened
to
remark
to
a
fellow
that
was
with
me
that
something
was
damned
nuisance
and
the
barmaid
leant
over
the
counter
shilling
sir
she
said
with
the
coolest
cheek
in
the
world
for
i
demanded
fine
sir
for
swearing
she
answered
with
the
most
perfect
assurance
look
here
young
woman
i
said
just
shut
up
for
i
not
going
to
stand
any
of
your
damned
nonsense
shillings
sir
she
said
in
just
the
same
tone
i
wanted
to
argue
the
question
but
she
would
say
a
word
more
she
just
sent
for
the
proprietor
and
he
said
it
was
his
wife
orders
she
would
have
any
female
in
her
service
insulted
by
bad
language
and
that
fellow
the
proprietor
actually
supported
his
wife
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
petticoat
government
he
made
me
pay
up
too
by
jove
i
was
obliged
to
do
it
to
save
a
row
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
sign
of
the
times
price
twitched
his
nose
and
looked
at
john
some
signs
of
the
times
are
hopeful
certainly
the
latter
said
enigmatically
what
talking
seriously
in
these
our
hours
of
ease
guthrie
brimston
broke
in
what
is
it
all
about
i
was
just
about
to
remark
that
i
like
a
woman
to
a
woman
captain
belliot
rejoined
ogling
the
lady
and
with
the
general
air
of
being
sure
that
she
at
least
could
have
no
higher
ambition
than
to
attain
to
his
ideal
these
bold
creatures
who
put
themselves
forward
as
so
many
of
them
do
nowadays
are
highly
antipathetic
to
me
and
if
you
saw
them
the
most
awful
old
harridans
with
voices
sisterhood
half
come
up
to
it
malcomson
passed
at
that
moment
should
you
call
an
old
harridan
john
asked
smiling
involuntarily
no
the
naval
man
was
obliged
to
confess
she
deuced
handsome
but
she
presumes
on
her
good
looks
and
does
trouble
herself
to
be
agreeable
i
took
her
in
to
dinner
the
other
night
and
could
hardly
get
a
word
out
of
her
not
that
she
ca
talk
mind
you
she
just
would
to
pique
my
interest
you
know
you
may
take
your
oath
that
was
it
no
being
up
to
women
but
she
find
herself
stranded
if
she
take
care
sha
bother
myself
to
pay
her
any
more
attention
and
i
a
bad
prophet
if
the
other
men
in
the
place
go
out
of
their
way
to
be
civil
to
her
much
longer
either
besides
he
said
to
price
lowering
his
voice
but
not
enough
to
prevent
john
hearing
her
husband
jealous
he
turned
up
his
eyes
game
not
worth
you
know
again
price
looked
at
john
the
band
struck
up
another
waltz
began
scarcely
anything
else
had
been
danced
oh
this
eternal
one
two
three
price
ejaculated
how
it
wearies
the
mind
society
has
sacrificed
its
most
varied
wholesome
and
graceful
recreation
dancing
to
this
monotonous
one
two
three
he
passed
on
leaving
john
to
his
reflections
captain
belliot
bent
before
guthrie
brimston
our
dance
i
think
he
said
offering
her
his
arm
she
took
it
perking
and
preening
herself
and
began
to
say
something
about
malcomson
in
agreement
with
his
last
remark
you
are
quite
right
about
her
john
overheard
she
is
always
jeering
at
men
she
abuses
you
wholesale
i
heard
her
often
captain
belliot
face
darkened
but
he
put
his
arm
round
his
partner
and
they
glided
off
together
slowly
when
next
they
passed
john
their
faces
wore
a
similar
expression
of
drowsy
sensuous
delight
which
gave
them
for
the
moment
a
curious
likeness
to
each
other
they
looked
incapable
of
speech
or
thought
or
anything
but
the
slow
measure
of
their
interwoven
paces
and
inarticulate
emotion
the
scene
made
a
painful
impression
on
john
and
he
began
to
feel
as
much
out
place
as
he
looked
we
churchmen
are
a
failure
he
thought
we
have
done
no
good
and
are
barely
tolerated
poetry
of
the
pulpit
spiritual
anodyne
what
is
it
something
i
can
not
grasp
but
something
wrong
somewhere
is
malcomson
right
is
price
where
are
they
he
looked
about
but
the
dancers
with
parted
lips
and
drowsy
dreamy
eyes
intoxicated
with
music
and
motion
floated
past
him
in
endless
regular
succession
hemming
him
in
so
that
he
could
not
move
till
the
music
stopped
chapter
malcomson
had
made
her
way
over
to
where
evadne
and
beale
were
sitting
both
welcomed
her
cordially
and
evadne
in
particular
brightened
visibly
when
she
saw
her
approach
she
was
wearied
by
these
vapid
men
who
had
all
said
the
same
thing
and
looked
at
her
with
the
same
expression
one
after
the
other
the
whole
afternoon
sillenger
and
price
were
also
of
the
party
and
malcomson
in
a
merry
mood
was
holding
forth
brightly
when
john
joined
them
oh
yes
we
have
our
reward
we
englishwomen
she
was
saying
we
religiously
obey
our
men
we
do
nothing
of
which
they
disapprove
we
are
the
meekest
sheep
in
the
world
we
scorn
your
independent
american
women
price
we
think
them
bold
and
unwomanly
and
do
all
we
can
to
be
as
unlike
them
as
possible
and
what
happens
do
our
men
adore
us
well
they
continue
to
say
so
but
it
is
the
americans
they
marry
price
twitched
his
nose
and
smiled
but
tell
me
price
malcomson
rattled
on
the
fate
of
nations
has
hung
upon
your
opinion
and
your
decisions
are
matter
of
history
so
kindly
condescend
of
your
goodness
and
of
your
wisdom
to
tell
us
if
you
think
that
womanliness
is
endangered
by
our
occupations
or
the
cut
of
our
clothes
i
have
it
she
broke
off
clasping
her
hands
make
us
a
speech
oh
yes
the
rest
exclaimed
simultaneously
price
mobile
countenance
twitched
all
over
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
then
entering
into
the
jest
he
struck
an
attitude
if
true
womanliness
has
been
endangered
by
occupation
or
the
fashion
of
a
frock
in
the
past
it
will
not
be
so
much
longer
or
the
signs
of
the
times
are
most
misleading
he
began
with
the
ease
of
an
orator
the
old
ideals
are
changing
and
we
regret
them
not
for
their
value
for
they
were
often
mischievous
enough
but
as
a
sign
of
change
to
which
in
itself
mankind
has
an
ineradicable
objection
yet
these
changes
must
take
place
if
we
are
ever
to
progress
for
myself
he
continued
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
that
anything
which
honourable
women
of
the
day
consider
a
reform
and
propose
to
adopt
is
or
until
it
has
been
thoroughly
tried
and
proved
to
be
so
it
sounds
mere
idiotcy
the
thing
is
so
obvious
when
one
reduces
it
to
words
but
yet
neither
men
nor
women
themselves
for
the
most
part
seem
to
recognize
the
fact
that
womanliness
is
a
matter
of
sex
not
of
circumstances
occupation
or
clothing
and
each
sex
has
instincts
and
proclivities
which
are
peculiar
to
it
and
do
not
differ
to
any
remarkable
extent
even
in
the
most
diverse
characters
from
which
we
may
be
sure
that
those
instincts
are
safe
whatever
happens
and
as
to
the
value
of
cherished
of
womankind
well
we
have
only
to
look
back
at
many
of
the
old
ones
which
had
to
be
abandoned
and
have
been
held
up
to
the
laughter
and
contempt
of
succeeding
ages
although
doubtless
they
were
dear
enough
to
the
heart
of
man
in
their
own
day
to
appreciate
the
worth
of
such
that
little
incident
of
jane
austin
hiding
away
the
precious
manuscript
she
was
engaged
upon
under
her
plain
sewing
when
visitors
arrived
ashamed
to
be
caught
at
the
occupation
of
writing
romances
and
shrinking
with
positive
pain
from
the
remarks
which
such
poor
foolish
people
as
those
she
feared
would
have
made
about
her
that
little
incident
alone
which
i
remarked
very
early
in
life
has
saved
me
from
braying
with
the
rest
of
the
world
upon
this
subject
if
those
brave
women
sure
of
themselves
and
of
their
message
who
have
written
in
the
face
of
all
opposition
had
not
dared
to
do
so
how
much
the
poorer
and
meaner
and
worse
we
should
all
men
and
women
alike
have
been
for
want
of
the
nourishment
of
strength
and
goodness
with
which
they
have
kept
us
provided
and
you
will
find
it
so
in
these
questions
of
our
day
women
are
bringing
a
storm
about
their
ears
but
they
are
prepared
for
that
and
it
will
not
deter
them
for
they
have
an
infallible
prescience
in
these
matters
which
men
have
not
and
they
know
what
they
are
doing
and
why
and
could
make
their
motives
plain
to
us
if
it
were
not
for
our
own
stupid
prejudices
and
density
ah
these
are
critical
times
but
i
believe
what
a
of
mine
has
already
written
i
believe
that
the
women
will
save
us
i
do
not
fear
the
fate
of
the
older
peoples
i
am
sure
that
we
shall
not
fall
into
nothingness
from
the
present
height
of
our
civilization
by
reason
of
our
sensuality
and
vice
as
all
the
great
nations
have
done
heretofore
the
women
will
rebel
the
women
will
not
allow
it
but
he
added
with
his
benign
smile
dropping
into
a
lighter
tone
as
if
he
felt
that
he
had
been
more
serious
than
the
occasion
warranted
and
addressing
malcomson
specially
but
you
must
not
despise
your
personal
appearance
beauty
is
a
great
power
and
it
may
be
used
for
good
as
well
as
for
evil
beauty
is
beneficent
as
well
as
malign
angels
are
always
allowed
to
be
beautiful
and
our
highest
ideal
of
manhood
is
associated
with
physical
as
well
as
moral
perfection
yes
be
sure
that
beauty
is
a
legitimate
means
of
grace
and
i
will
venture
to
suggest
that
you
who
have
it
should
use
it
as
such
here
he
was
interrupted
by
applause
true
beauty
i
mean
of
course
he
added
descending
from
the
rostrum
as
it
were
and
speaking
colloquially
not
the
fashionable
travesty
of
it
well
that
is
a
piece
of
servility
i
have
never
been
so
degraded
as
to
practise
malcomson
exclaimed
ah
my
dear
it
does
not
do
to
be
singular
beale
mildly
remonstrated
a
dance
concluded
just
at
this
moment
and
edith
joined
the
group
followed
by
sir
mosley
menteith
the
ladies
looked
at
her
as
she
approached
with
affectionate
interest
and
admiration
i
am
always
conscious
of
their
presence
she
was
saying
whose
presence
dear
her
mother
asked
the
presence
of
those
who
love
us
mother
in
the
other
life
she
said
looking
out
into
space
with
great
serious
eyes
as
if
she
saw
something
grand
and
beautiful
and
also
the
words
and
her
presence
changed
the
whole
mental
attitude
of
the
group
the
intellectual
element
subsided
the
spiritual
which
trenches
on
sensation
and
is
warm
began
to
glow
in
their
breasts
edith
was
the
actor
now
and
malcomson
became
a
mere
spectator
john
was
the
first
to
appreciate
the
change
edith
presence
more
than
her
words
was
enough
in
itself
to
relax
the
tension
of
pained
reflection
which
had
possessed
him
the
whole
afternoon
it
was
as
if
a
draught
of
the
sacred
anodyne
to
which
he
had
been
so
long
accustomed
were
being
held
out
to
him
and
he
had
drained
it
eagerly
to
excite
feeling
and
to
drown
thought
mosley
does
not
think
they
are
so
near
us
as
i
know
them
to
be
edith
pursued
but
i
tell
him
if
only
he
would
allow
himself
he
would
perceive
their
presence
just
as
i
do
he
says
this
scene
is
so
worldly
it
would
frighten
them
but
i
answer
that
they
can
not
be
frightened
they
are
incorruptible
so
that
there
is
nothing
for
them
to
fear
for
themselves
but
they
may
fear
for
us
and
when
they
do
we
know
that
it
is
then
that
they
are
nearest
to
us
they
come
to
guard
us
menteith
glance
wandered
over
her
person
as
she
spoke
and
returned
again
to
meet
her
eyes
he
quite
enjoyed
a
thrill
of
superstitious
awe
it
was
an
excellent
to
what
he
called
his
sentiments
by
which
he
meant
the
state
of
his
senses
at
the
moment
he
recognized
in
edith
no
higher
quality
than
that
of
innocence
which
is
so
appetizing
but
a
gentle
thrill
as
of
an
electric
shock
had
passed
through
them
all
silencing
them
beale
with
a
sigh
released
herself
from
the
uneasy
impression
malcomson
words
had
made
upon
her
and
felt
the
peace
of
mind
which
she
managed
to
preserve
by
refusing
to
know
of
anything
that
might
disturb
it
and
rouse
her
soul
from
its
apathetic
calm
to
the
harassing
point
of
action
restored
sillenger
gave
herself
up
for
the
moment
also
her
fine
nature
although
highly
tempered
and
exceedingly
sensitive
was
too
broad
to
allow
her
to
delude
herself
by
imagining
that
it
is
right
to
countenance
evil
by
ignoring
it
she
shrank
from
knowledge
but
still
she
had
the
courage
to
possess
herself
of
it
and
fortunately
her
very
sensitiveness
enabled
her
to
turn
with
ease
from
the
consideration
of
terrible
facts
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
fine
idea
malcomson
and
austin
price
looked
at
each
other
involuntarily
the
new
element
was
not
congenial
to
either
of
them
but
john
was
satisfied
his
heart
had
expanded
to
the
full
price
is
wrong
malcomson
is
wrong
was
the
new
measure
to
which
he
set
his
thoughts
they
exaggerated
the
evil
they
have
never
perceived
in
what
the
good
consists
and
what
do
they
do
with
all
their
wondrous
clever
talk
they
withdraw
our
attention
from
the
contemplation
of
holy
things
only
to
pain
and
excite
us
for
sin
must
continue
and
suffering
must
continue
and
we
can
do
no
more
than
we
have
done
example
a
good
example
we
have
only
each
to
set
one
and
say
nothing
talk
talk
talk
i
will
listen
no
more
to
such
tattle
it
is
mere
pride
of
intellect
which
is
put
to
shame
by
the
first
gentle
innocent
girl
who
comes
strong
in
purity
and
faith
and
simply
bids
us
all
look
up
did
not
our
heart
burn
within
us
was
not
the
worst
among
us
and
the
most
worldly
moved
to
repent
he
looked
across
at
menteith
but
suddenly
the
exaltation
ceased
and
his
soul
shot
with
a
pang
to
another
extreme
he
is
not
worthy
of
her
he
is
not
worthy
of
her
no
no
heaven
help
me
to
save
her
from
such
a
fate
his
mind
had
been
nourished
upon
inconsistencies
and
he
was
as
unconscious
of
any
now
as
he
was
when
he
preached
as
he
had
been
taught
that
god
orders
all
things
for
the
best
and
at
the
same
time
prayed
him
to
avert
some
special
catastrophe
menteith
was
bending
over
edith
i
want
to
lunch

me

love
to
hear
you
talk
just
to
be

a
better
man
of
me
but
you
can
make
anything
you
like
of

you
know
you
can
may
i
come
edith
glanced
tip
at
him
and
smiled
and
the
young
man
taking
this
for
acquiescence
bowed
and
withdrew
in
triumph
making
way
for
colonel
colquhoun
evadne
looked
up
at
the
latter
and
smiled
too
shall
we
go
she
said
i
came
to
see
if
you
were
ready
he
answered
and
then
she
rose
took
leave
of
the
friends
about
her
crossed
the
deck
to
where
captain
belliot
her
host
was
standing
shook
hands
with
him
and
left
the
ship
many
eyes
had
followed
her
with
curiosity
and
interest
and
many
tongues
made
remarks
about
her
when
she
was
gone
expressing
positive
opinions
with
the
confident
conceit
of
mediocrity
although
she
had
not
at
that
time
made
any
sign
of
what
manner
of
person
she
really
was
she
had
only
been
a
week
amongst
them
and
her
mind
had
been
in
a
state
of
passive
receptivity
the
whole
time
subject
to
the
impressions
which
might
be
made
upon
it
but
not
itself
producing
any
it
was
her
appearance
that
they
presumed
to
judge
her
by
but
her
intellect
had
been
both
nourished
and
stimulated
that
afternoon
and
when
she
went
to
her
room
at
night
she
hunted
up
a
manuscript
book
suitable
for
the
purpose
and
resumed
her
old
habit
of
noting
everything
of
interest
which
she
had
seen
and
heard
there
were
blank
pages
still
in
the
old
commonplace
book
and
she
had
it
with
her
but
she
never
dreamt
of
making
another
note
in
it
she
had
written
her
last
there
once
for
all
the
night
before
her
wedding
expecting
to
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
existence
and
she
had
indeed
entered
upon
a
new
phase
although
not
at
all
in
the
way
she
had
expected
and
now
she
felt
that
only
a
new
volume
would
be
appropriate
to
contain
the
record
of
it
she
ended
her
notes
that
night
with
a
maxim
which
probably
contained
all
the
wisdom
she
had
been
able
to
extract
from
her
late
experiences
just
do
a
thing
and
do
talk
about
it
she
wrote
expressing
herself
colloquially
this
is
the
great
secret
of
success
in
all
enterprises
talk
means
discussion
discussion
means
irritation
irritation
means
opposition
and
opposition
means
hindrance
always
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
chapter
vi
evadne
settled
down
into
her
new
position
at
once
she
took
charge
of
the
household
and
managed
it
well
colonel
colquhoun
was
scrupulous
in
matters
of
etiquette
and
evadne
love
of
order
and
exactitude
made
her
punctilious
too
so
that
there
was
one
subject
which
they
agreed
upon
perfectly
and
it
very
soon
came
to
be
said
of
them
that
they
always
did
the
right
thing
they
appeared
together
everywhere
at
the
palace
receptions
the
opera
entertainments
on
naval
vessels
dinners
and
dances
polo
and
picnics
and
at
church
if
there
was
one
thing
that
colquhoun
was
more
particular
about
than
another
it
was
in
the
language
of
his
own
profession
church
parade
watching
evadne
to
detect
the
first
symptom
of
new
tactics
on
her
part
became
one
of
the
interests
of
his
life
it
would
have
been
good
form
to
take
another
man
into
his
confidence
for
betting
purposes
seeing
that
the
lady
was
colquhoun
but
a
wager
laid
upon
the
chances
of
change
in
her
views
was
the
only
zest
lacking
to
the
pleasure
he
took
in
the
study
of
this
new
specimen
of
her
sex
he
used
to
dance
a
good
deal
himself
and
danced
well
too
but
after
evadne
joined
him
he
gave
it
up
to
a
great
extent
and
might
often
have
been
seen
leaning
against
a
pillar
in
a
ball
room
gravely
observing
her
it
was
a
kind
of
curiosity
he
suffered
from
a
sort
of
rage
to
make
her
out
he
was
very
attentive
to
her
at
that
period
treating
her
always
with
the
deference
due
to
a
young
lady
and
for
that
reason
she
accepted
his
attentions
gratefully
because
they
were
delicately
paid
and
he
was
really
kind
but
also
as
a
matter
of
course
they
had
begun
well
together
from
the
very
first
day
and
she
was
soon
satisfied
that
her
position
at
malta
was
the
happiest
possible
the
beautiful
place
the
bright
clear
atmosphere
the
lively
society
all
suited
her
she
had
none
of
the
trials
peculiar
to
married
life
to
injure
her
health
and
break
her
spirit
none
of
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
a
girl
to
limit
her
pleasures
and
she
enjoyed
her
independence
thoroughly
but
of
course
there
were
drawbacks
and
the
thing
of
all
others
she
disliked
most
was
being
toadied
there
was
one
pair
of
inveterate
toadies
in
the
garrison
major
and
guthrie
brimston
they
belonged
to
a
species
in
the
service
and
tolerated
on
the
principle
of
pourvu
que
tu
nous
major
guthrie
brimston
claimed
to
be
one
of
the
morningquest
family
and
he
had
a
portrait
of
the
duke
as
the
head
of
the
house
in
his
dressing
room
it
was
balanced
on
the
right
by
and
on
the
left
by
the
but
it
was
popularly
supposed
that
he
worshipped
the
duke
the
pair
acted
the
role
of
devoted
husband
and
wife
successfully
being
in
fact
sincere
in
their
habit
of
playing
into
each
other
hands
for
their
own
selfish
purposes
and
people
who
wished
for
an
excuse
to
tolerate
them
because
they
were
amusing
might
say
of
them
quite
truly
well
whatever
their
faults
they
are
certainly
devoted
to
each
other
but
it
was
a
partnership
of
enhanced
by
a
little
sentimentality
and
they
understood
it
themselves
for
guthrie
brimston
confessed
in
a
moment
of
expansion
that
she
knew
bobbie
would
marry
again
directly
if
she
died
and
certainly
she
would
do
the
same
if
she
lost
him
why
should
she
guthrie
brimston
was
a
woman
of
extremely
coarse
conversation
and
without
compromising
herself
she
was
a
fecund
source
of
corruption
in
others
no
younger
woman
of
undecided
character
could
come
under
her
influence
without
being
tainted
in
mind
if
not
in
manners
she
delighted
in
objectionable
stories
and
her
husband
fed
her
fancy
from
the
clubs
liberally
her
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
these
stories
which
she
would
retail
to
her
lady
friends
at
afternoon
teas
she
told
them
remarkably
well
too
and
knew
exactly
how
to
suit
them
to
palates
which
were
only
just
beginning
to
acquire
a
taste
for
such
fare
and
were
still
fastidious
wherever
she
came
there
was
laughter
among
the
ladies
of
the
high
hysteric
bacchante
kind
not
true
mirth
but
a
loud
laxity
into
which
they
were
beguiled
for
the
moment
and
which
was
the
cause
of
disgust
and
regret
upon
reflection
to
the
better
kind
if
the
question
of
motive
is
to
be
taken
into
account
in
considering
the
words
and
deeds
of
people
it
may
be
confidently
asserted
that
the
guthrie
brimstons
never
said
a
thing
nor
did
a
kind
one
i
say
minnie
if
i
give
that
sergeant
of
mine
a
goose
at
christmas
i
think
i
get
more
work
out
of
the
fellow
next
year
major
brimston
said
to
his
wife
at
breakfast
one
morning
yes
do
his
wife
answered
sympathetically
and
i
say
bobbie
going
to
work
captain
askew
a
bedspread
he
an
awfully
useful
little
man
one
form
of
pleasantry
the
guthrie
brimstons
greatly
affected
was
nicknaming
they
nicknamed
everybody
always
opprobriously
often
happily
in
the
way
of
hitting
off
a
salient
peculiarity
but
they
were
not
in
the
least
aware
that
they
were
themselves
the
best
nicknamed
people
in
the
service
and
they
would
not
have
liked
it
had
they
known
it
for
they
were
both
exceedingly
touchy
they
held
no
feelings
of
another
sacred
but
their
own
supreme
guthrie
brimston
was
known
as
the
brimston
woman
her
conversation
bristled
with
vain
repetitions
she
was
always
a
worm
when
asked
after
her
health
and
everything
that
pleased
her
was
pucka
she
knew
no
language
but
her
own
and
that
she
spoke
indifferently
her
command
of
it
being
limited
for
the
most
part
to
slang
expressions
which
are
the
scum
of
language
and
a
few
stock
phrases
of
polite
quality
for
special
occasions
but
she
used
the
latter
awkwardly
as
workmen
wear
their
sunday
clothes
of
the
guthrie
brimston
morals
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
would
neither
of
them
have
broken
either
the
sixth
seventh
or
eighth
commandments
but
they
bore
false
witness
freely
not
in
open
assertion
however
for
that
could
be
easily
refuted
and
fair
fight
was
not
at
all
in
their
line
but
when
false
witness
could
be
meanly
conveyed
by
implication
and
innuendo
it
formed
the
staple
of
their
conversation
those
guthrie
brimstons
should
be
public
prosecutors
evadne
said
to
colonel
colquhoun
at
breakfast
one
morning
commenting
upon
some
story
of
theirs
which
he
had
just
retailed
to
her
i
notice
when
character
is
brought
forward
to
be
judged
by
society
they
are
always
counsel
for
the
prosecution
these
were
the
people
whom
colonel
colquhoun
first
introduced
to
evadne
they
amused
him
and
therefore
he
encouraged
them
to
come
to
the
house
guthrie
brimston
suited
him
exactly
to
use
their
own
choice
language
he
would
have
given
her
away
at
any
time
and
she
him
but
that
did
not
prevent
them
enjoying
each
other
society
thoroughly
true
to
her
determination
to
make
things
pleasant
for
colonel
colquhoun
if
possible
and
seeing
that
he
found
these
people
congenial
evadne
did
her
best
to
cultivate
their
acquaintance
for
his
sake
never
successfully
however
a
mere
tolerance
was
as
far
as
she
got
but
even
that
was
intermittent
and
the
undercurrent
of
criticism
which
streamed
through
her
mind
in
their
presence
could
never
be
checked
but
she
was
slow
to
read
character
her
impulse
was
always
to
believe
in
people
and
to
like
them
and
she
had
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
their
faults
painfully
bit
by
bit
but
colonel
colquhoun
helped
her
here
he
was
an
inveterate
gossip
very
much
in
the
manner
of
guthrie
brimston
herself
only
that
he
was
more
refined
when
he
talked
to
evadne
and
at
breakfast
their
one
meal
in
the
day
it
was
his
habit
to
tell
her
such
club
stories
as
were
sufficiently
decent
and
what
he
said
and
what
she
said
of
each
other
upon
which
he
would
strike
an
average
to
arrive
at
the
probable
truth
do
you
happen
to
know
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
feud
between
guthrie
brimston
and
mrs
malcomson
he
asked
her
one
morning
at
breakfast
guthrie
brimston
defects
of
character
obviously
said
evadne
sententiously
then
you
prefer
mrs
malcomson
he
suggested
now
ca
get
on
with
her
a
bit
she
always
appears
to
me
so
cold
and
censorious
does
she
said
evadne
thoughtfully
but
she
is
not
really
so
at
all
she
is
judicial
though
and
sincere
which
gives
one
a
sense
of
security
in
her
presence
but
she
is
deadly
dull
said
colonel
colquhoun
oh
no
evadne
exclaimed
smiling
you
mistake
her
entirely
she
made
me
laugh
immoderately
only
yesterday
i
should
like
to
see
you
laugh
immoderately
said
colonel
colquhoun
major
guthrie
brimston
surprised
evadne
more
perhaps
than
his
wife
did
she
began
by
overlooking
the
little
man
somehow
without
the
least
intending
it
and
as
he
seemed
to
himself
to
fill
the
horizon
when
in
society
and
block
out
all
view
of
anybody
else
he
could
only
believe
that
she
did
it
on
purpose
he
was
by
way
of
being
an
amateur
actor
a
low
comedy
man
but
he
was
not
sincere
enough
to
personate
any
character
or
be
anything
either
on
the
stage
or
off
it
but
his
own
small
inartistic
self
and
no
amount
of
bawling
could
make
him
an
actor
though
he
bawled
himself
hoarse
as
a
rule
mistaking
sound
for
the
science
of
expression
still
it
was
the
fashion
to
consider
him
funny
people
called
him
grigsby
and
kickleberry
brown
and
laughed
when
he
twiddled
his
thumbs
he
was
forever
buffooning
and
if
he
sat
on
a
high
stool
with
his
toes
just
touching
the
floor
his
head
on
one
side
a
sad
expression
of
countenance
and
the
tips
of
his
fingers
touching
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
something
amusing
and
the
effort
would
be
rewarded
with
laughter
in
which
however
evadne
could
not
join
these
performances
outraged
her
sense
of
the
dignity
of
poor
human
nature
which
it
is
easy
enough
to
discount
but
very
difficult
to
maintain
and
made
her
sorry
for
him
his
hands
were
another
offence
to
her
they
were
fat
and
podgy
with
short
pointed
fingers
indicative
of
animalism
and
the
opposite
of
all
that
is
refined
and
beautiful
truly
of
necessity
an
offence
to
her
it
was
at
first
that
she
had
overlooked
him
but
after
a
time
when
she
began
to
know
him
better
the
little
fat
funny
man
magnetized
her
attention
she
could
not
help
gravely
considering
him
wherever
she
met
him
and
wondering
about
him
wondering
about
them
both
in
fact
she
wondered
for
one
thing
why
they
were
so
fond
of
eating
and
drinking
her
own
taste
in
those
matters
being
of
the
simplest
description
i
never
deny
myself
anything
said
guthrie
brimston
and
she
looked
like
it
evadne
wondered
also
at
their
meanness
when
she
saw
them
saving
money
by
borrowing
the
carriages
of
people
whom
she
had
heard
them
class
as
nothing
but
shopkeepers
you
know
we
should
speak
to
them
anywhere
else
and
whom
they
ridiculed
habitually
for
the
mispronunciation
of
words
and
for
accents
unmistakably
provincial
what
could
evadne
have
in
common
with
these
flippant
people
scum
themselves
forever
on
the
surface
incapable
even
of
seeing
beneath
their
every
idea
and
motive
a
falsification
of
something
divine
in
life
or
thought
they
did
not
even
speak
the
same
language
to
their
insidious
slang
she
opposed
a
smooth
current
of
perfect
english
which
seemed
to
reflect
upon
the
inferior
quality
of
their
own
expressions
and
led
to
mutual
embarrassment
evadne
meant
every
word
she
uttered
and
was
careful
to
choose
the
one
which
should
best
express
her
meaning
guthrie
brimston
meanings
on
the
other
hand
told
best
when
half
concealed
another
difficulty
was
too
that
evadne
clear
decided
speech
had
the
effect
of
exposing
innuendo
and
insincerity
and
making
both
bad
form
which
socially
speaking
is
a
much
more
terrible
stigma
to
bear
than
an
accusation
of
dishonesty
however
well
authenticated
and
even
their
very
manner
of
expressing
legitimate
mirth
was
not
the
same
for
guthrie
brimston
laughed
aloud
while
evadne
laugh
was
soundless
evadne
suffered
when
she
found
herself
being
toadied
by
these
people
she
said
nothing
however
they
were
colonel
colquhoun
friends
and
she
felt
herself
forced
to
be
civil
to
them
so
long
as
he
chose
to
bring
them
to
the
house
and
they
were
besides
an
evil
out
of
which
good
came
to
her
quickly
for
as
soon
as
she
understood
their
manners
and
their
modes
of
thought
she
felt
her
heart
fill
with
earnest
if
these
are
the
kind
of
people
whom
colonel
colquhoun
prefers
was
her
mental
ejaculation
what
an
escape
i
have
had
thank
heaven
he
is
nothing
to
me
chapter
vii
society
in
malta
during
the
sunny
winter
is
very
much
like
the
society
of
a
london
season
only
that
it
is
more
representative
because
there
are
fewer
specimens
of
each
class
and
those
who
do
go
out
are
like
delegates
charged
with
a
concentrated
extract
of
the
peculiarities
and
prejudices
of
their
own
set
when
evadne
arrived
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
the
rest
of
the
party
had
already
assembled
there
were
naval
people
military
commercial
landed
gentry
clerical
royalty
and
beer
the
principal
representative
of
this
latter
interest
was
a
lady
whom
guthrie
brimston
called
the
queen
of
beersheba
because
of
her
splendid
habiliments
and
this
is
a
fair
specimen
of
guthrie
brimston
wit
evadne
was
received
in
silence
as
it
were
for
abroad
the
question
is
not
generally
who
are
you
as
at
home
but
what
are
you
like
or
how
much
can
you
do
for
us
and
people
were
waiting
till
she
showed
her
colours
she
never
did
show
any
decided
colours
of
the
usual
kind
however
she
was
not
a
beauty
beyond
doubt
some
people
did
not
admire
her
in
the
least
she
was
not
the
same
or
nice
to
everybody
for
she
had
strong
objections
to
certain
people
and
showed
that
she
had
and
she
was
not
by
way
of
entertaining
at
all
although
she
did
as
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
as
other
ladies
of
her
station
but
yet
with
all
these
negatives
she
made
a
distinct
impression
on
the
place
as
soon
as
she
appeared
it
sounds
paradoxical
but
she
was
celebrated
at
once
for
her
silence
and
for
what
she
had
said
the
weight
of
her
occasional
utterances
told
and
if
it
were
fair
to
call
guthrie
brimston
counsel
for
the
prosecution
evadne
might
have
been
set
up
as
counsel
for
the
defence
for
it
so
happened
that
when
she
did
speak
in
those
early
days
it
was
usually
in
defence
of
something
or
somebody
people
principles
absent
friends
enemies
anything
unfairly
attacked
generally
when
she
said
anything
cutting
it
was
so
clearly
incisive
you
hardly
knew
for
a
moment
where
you
were
injured
she
did
it
like
the
executioner
of
that
eastern
potentate
who
decapitated
a
criminal
with
such
skill
and
with
so
sharp
an
instrument
that
the
latter
did
not
know
when
he
was
executed
and
went
on
talking
his
head
remaining
until
he
sneezed
there
was
one
old
gentleman
lord
groome
whom
she
had
disposed
of
several
times
in
that
way
without
however
being
able
to
get
rid
of
him
quite
because
his
stupidity
was
a
hardy
perennial
which
came
up
again
all
the
fresher
and
stronger
for
having
been
lopped
he
was
a
degenerated
old
object
a
man
with
the
most
touching
confidence
in
his
tailor
which
the
latter
invariably
betrayed
by
never
making
him
a
garment
that
fitted
him
he
had
begun
by
admiring
evadne
and
had
endeavoured
to
pay
his
senile
court
to
her
with
fulsome
flatteries
in
the
manner
approved
of
his
kind
but
he
ended
by
being
afraid
of
her
his
first
collision
with
evadne
was
on
the
subject
of
those
low
radicals
against
whom
he
had
been
launching
out
in
unmeasured
terms
why
low
because
radical
she
asked
i
should
have
thought
among
so
many
that
some
must
be
honest
men
and
nothing
honest
can
be
low
i
tell
you
my
dear
lady
he
replied
his
temper
tried
by
her
words
but
controlled
by
her
appearance
i
tell
you
the
radicals
are
a
low
lot
the
whole
of
them
ah
then
i
suppose
you
know
them
all
she
said
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
the
want
of
intelligence
in
the
community
at
large
was
made
painfully
apparent
by
the
stories
of
her
peculiar
opinions
which
were
freely
circulated
and
seldom
suspected
the
queen
of
beersheba
declared
that
evadne
approved
of
the
frightful
cruelties
which
the
people
inflicted
on
the
nobles
during
the
reign
of
terror
that
she
had
heard
her
say
so
herself
what
evadne
did
say
was
the
revolutionary
excesses
were
inevitable
they
came
at
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
which
the
nobles
themselves
had
set
in
motion
and
if
you
consider
the
sufferings
that
had
been
inflicted
on
the
people
and
their
long
endurance
of
them
you
will
be
more
surprised
to
think
that
they
kept
their
reason
so
long
than
that
they
should
have
lost
it
at
last
la
populace
ce
jamais
par
envie
se
soulčve
mais
par
impatience
de
souffrir
but
the
french
revolution
is
an
abstract
subject
of
impersonal
interest
compared
with
the
irish
question
at
the
present
time
and
the
commotion
which
was
caused
by
the
misrepresentation
of
evadne
remarks
about
the
reign
of
terror
was
insignificant
compared
with
what
followed
when
her
feeling
for
ireland
had
been
misinterpreted
she
gave
out
the
text
which
called
forth
the
second
series
of
imbecilities
daring
a
dinner
party
at
her
own
house
one
night
her
old
friend
lord
groome
supplying
her
with
a
peg
upon
which
to
hang
her
conclusions
by
making
an
intemperate
attack
upon
the
irish
chapter
viii
captain
belliot
was
not
one
of
the
guests
at
that
dinner
party
of
evadne
but
he
happened
to
call
on
guthrie
brimston
next
day
and
finding
her
alone
had
tea
with
her
and
of
course
she
entertained
him
with
her
own
version
of
what
had
occurred
the
night
before
the
dinner
itself
was
very
good
she
said
all
their
dinners
are
you
know
but
colquhoun
was
she
raised
her
hands
and
nodded
her
head
well
just
awful
she
concluded
indeed
he
observed
leaning
back
in
his
chair
crossing
his
legs
and
settling
himself
for
a
treat
generally
you
surprise
me
because
she
has
never
struck
me
as
being
the
kind
of
person
who
would
set
the
thames
on
fire
in
any
way
guthrie
brimston
smiled
enigmatically
do
you
admire
her
very
much
she
asked
with
the
utmost
suavity
well
he
answered
warily
she
is
rather
peculiar
in
appearance
you
know
guthrie
brimston
drew
her
own
conclusions
not
from
the
words
but
from
the
wariness
and
proceeded
it
is
not
in
appearance
only
that
that
she
is
peculiar
then
she
astonished
us
all
last
night
i
can
assure
you
how
he
asked
to
fill
up
an
artistic
pause
by
the
things
she
said
guthrie
brimston
answered
with
an
affectation
of
reserve
now
you
do
surprise
me
captain
belliot
declared
because
i
can
not
imagine
her
saying
anything
but
do
you
do
and
and
you
and
you
think
so
on
my
honour
those
words
are
all
i
have
ever
heard
her
utter
and
i
have
met
her
as
often
as
anybody
on
the
island
now
like
a
woman
with
something
in
her
he
concluded
ogling
guthrie
brimston
well
then
she
must
have
been
hibernating
or
something
when
she
first
came
out
for
she
has
begun
to
talk
now
with
a
vengeance
guthrie
brimston
answered
smartly
but
what
has
she
been
saying
he
asked
with
great
curiosity
i
simply
can
not
tell
you
she
answered
pointedly
so
bad
as
that
he
said
raising
his
eyebrows
yes
things
that
woman
should
have
said
she
subjoined
with
emphasis
there
was
of
course
only
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
and
it
would
have
been
drawn
at
the
club
later
in
the
day
inevitably
even
if
other
ladies
had
not
also
declared
that
colquhoun
had
said
such
dreadful
things
that
they
really
could
not
repeat
them
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
men
of
the
party
mentioned
the
matter
in
a
different
way
and
one
when
asked
what
it
was
exactly
that
colquhoun
had
said
even
answered
casually
oh
some
rot
about
the
irish
question
but
the
explanation
made
no
impression
and
was
immediately
forgotten
captain
belliot
himself
was
so
excited
by
the
news
that
he
hurried
away
from
guthrie
brimston
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
excuse
himself
without
giving
offence
and
went
at
once
to
call
upon
evadne
in
order
to
inspect
her
from
this
unexpected
point
of
view
he
found
her
talking
tranquilly
to
john
edith
and
beale
and
although
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
she
never
said
a
word
of
the
slightest
significance
that
however
proved
nothing
either
one
way
or
the
other
and
he
left
her
with
his
confidence
in
guthrie
insinuations
quite
unshaken
his
theory
being
that
the
women
whose
minds
are
in
reality
the
most
corrupt
are
as
a
rule
very
carefully
guarded
in
their
conversation
although
of
course
they
always
betray
themselves
sooner
or
later
by
some
such
slip
as
that
with
which
he
credited
evadne
an
idea
which
he
proceeded
to
expand
at
the
club
with
great
effect
evadne
reputation
was
in
danger
after
that
and
she
risked
it
still
further
by
acting
in
defiance
of
the
public
opinion
of
the
island
generally
in
order
to
do
what
she
conceived
to
be
an
act
of
justice
guthrie
brimston
went
to
her
one
morning
brimming
over
with
news
my
husband
has
just
received
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
his
in
india
major
lopside
telling
him
to
warn
us
all
not
to
call
on
clarence
who
has
just
joined
your
regiment
she
burst
out
i
thought
i
ought
to
let
you
know
at
once
she
met
her
husband
in
india
major
lopside
says
and
it
was
a
runaway
match
but
that
is
not
all
for
he
says
he
knows
for
a
fact
that
they
travelled
together
for
three
hundred
miles
down
country
sleeping
at
all
the
dak
bungalows
by
the
way
before
they
married
waiting
until
they
came
to
some
place
where
they
could
be
married
i
suppose
evadne
suggested
guthrie
brimston
laughed
taking
a
sort
of
trial
trip
i
should
say
she
ventured
but
it
was
very
good
of
major
lopside
to
let
us
know
i
should
certainly
have
called
if
he
had
you
make
me
feel
sick
evadne
began
i
knew
i
should
mrs
guthrie
brimston
interposed
triumphantly
sick
at
heart
evadne
pursued
to
think
of
an
englishman
being
capable
of
writing
a
letter
for
the
express
purpose
of
ruining
a
reputation
brimston
changed
countenance
we
think
it
was
awfully
kind
of
major
lopside
to
let
us
know
she
repeated
perking
well
think
said
evadne
her
slow
utterance
giving
double
weight
to
each
word
think
he
must
be
an
exceedingly
low
person
himself
and
one
probably
whom
clarence
has
had
to
snub
he
could
only
have
been
actuated
by
animus
when
he
wrote
that
letter
one
may
be
quite
sure
that
a
man
is
never
disinterested
when
he
does
a
low
thing
it
was
a
private
letter
written
for
our
private
information
guthrie
brimston
asserted
she
was
ruffled
considerably
by
this
time
no
not
written
for
your
private
information
evadne
rejoined
or
if
it
were
you
are
making
a
strange
use
of
it
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
it
was
designed
for
the
very
purpose
to
which
you
are
putting
it
the
purpose
of
spoiling
the
clarences
chance
of
happiness
in
a
new
place
and
it
is
precisely
to
the
character
of
the
document
that
i
take
exception
if
this
major
lopside
has
any
accusation
to
bring
against
captain
clarence
he
should
have
done
it
publicly
and
not
in
this
underhand
manner
he
should
have
written
to
colonel
colquhoun
nonsense
said
guthrie
brimston
her
native
rudeness
getting
the
better
of
her
habitual
caution
at
this
provocation
major
lopside
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
report
a
man
to
his
own
chief
why
he
might
get
the
worst
of
it
himself
if
there
were
an
inquiry
exactly
evadne
answered
he
thinks
it
safer
to
stab
in
the
dark
will
you
kindly
excuse
me
i
am
very
busy
this
morning
writing
my
letters
for
the
mail
but
many
thanks
for
letting
me
know
about
this
malicious
story
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
retire
after
this
which
guthrie
brimston
did
discomfited
and
with
an
uneasy
feeling
which
had
been
growing
upon
her
lately
that
evadne
was
not
quite
the
nonentity
for
which
she
had
mistaken
her
colonel
colquhoun
had
lunched
at
mess
that
day
and
evadne
did
not
see
him
until
quite
late
when
she
met
him
on
the
barraca
with
the
guthrie
brimstons
it
was
the
hour
when
the
barraca
is
thronged
and
evadne
had
gone
with
a
purpose
expecting
to
find
him
there
he
left
the
guthrie
brimstons
and
joined
her
as
soon
as
she
appeared
i
have
been
home
to
look
for
you
he
said
but
i
found
that
you
had
gone
out
without
an
escort
no
one
knew
where
i
have
been
making
calls
evadne
answered
and
making
acquaintance
also
oh
there
she
is
leaning
against
that
arch
with
her
husband
have
you
met
her
yet
let
me
introduce
you
she
is
charmingly
pretty
but
very
timid
colonel
colquhoun
brow
contracted
i
thought
guthrie
brimston
had
warned
you
me
evadne
quietly
interposed
guthrie
brimston
brought
me
a
scandalous
story
which
had
the
effect
of
making
me
call
on
clarence
at
once
i
suppose
you
have
seen
this
precious
major
lopside
letter
yes
he
answered
and
i
am
sorry
you
called
without
consulting
me
you
really
ought
to
have
consulted
me
it
will
make
it
doubly
awkward
for
you
having
called
but
we
rush
the
fellow
i
make
him
send
in
his
papers
at
once
why
is
it
awkward
for
me
what
is
awkward
for
me
evadne
asked
why
having
a
lady
in
the
regiment
you
ca
know
to
begin
with
and
having
to
cut
her
after
calling
upon
her
he
answered
if
you
would
only
condescend
to
consult
me
occasionally
i
could
save
you
from
this
kind
of
thing
but
why
may
i
not
countenance
mrs
clarence
you
can
not
countenance
a
woman
there
is
a
story
about
he
responded
decidedly
but
where
is
the
proof
of
the
story
she
asked
colonel
colquhoun
reflected
a
man
would
write
a
letter
of
that
kind
without
some
grounds
for
it
he
said
we
must
find
out
what
the
exact
grounds
were
said
evadne
well
you
see
none
of
the
other
ladies
are
speaking
to
her
colonel
colquhoun
observed
with
the
air
of
one
whose
argument
is
unanswerable
they
are
sheep
said
evadne
but
they
can
be
led
aright
as
well
as
astray
i
suppose
we
see
at
all
events
but
do
let
me
keep
you
from
your
friends
i
want
to
speak
to
mrs
malcomson
there
was
a
quiet
sense
of
power
about
evadne
when
she
chose
to
act
which
checked
opposition
at
the
outset
and
put
an
end
to
argument
colonel
colquhoun
looked
disheartened
but
like
a
gentleman
he
acted
at
once
on
the
hint
to
go
he
did
not
rejoin
the
guthrie
brimstons
however
but
sat
alone
under
one
of
the
arches
of
the
barraca
turning
his
back
on
the
entrancing
view
of
the
grand
harbour
a
jewel
of
beauty
set
in
silence
colonel
colquhoun
was
watching
he
saw
clarence
turn
from
the
strange
christian
women
who
eyed
her
coldly
and
lean
over
the
parapet
he
saw
the
influence
of
the
scene
upon
her
mind
in
the
sweet
and
tranquil
expression
which
gradually
replaced
the
look
her
face
had
been
wearing
he
saw
her
husband
standing
beside
her
but
with
his
back
to
the
parapet
looking
at
the
people
gloomily
and
with
resentment
but
also
perceiving
that
his
wife
was
being
slighted
and
wondering
why
colonel
colquhoun
saw
guthrie
brimston
also
going
from
one
group
to
another
with
the
peculiar
gait
of
a
woman
followed
by
her
little
fat
bobbie
smiling
herself
and
met
with
smiles
which
were
followed
by
noisy
laughter
and
he
noticed
too
that
invariably
the
eyes
of
those
she
addressed
turned
upon
clarence
and
their
faces
grew
hard
and
unfriendly
and
not
one
person
to
whom
she
spoke
looked
the
happier
or
the
better
for
the
attention
when
she
left
them
colonel
colquhoun
with
a
set
countenance
slowly
curled
his
blond
moustache
only
his
eyes
moved
following
guthrie
brimston
for
a
while
and
then
returning
to
evadne
she
was
speaking
to
malcomson
and
the
latter
looked
as
she
listened
at
guthrie
brimston
then
evadne
took
her
arm
and
the
two
sauntered
over
to
beale
an
important
person
who
always
adopted
the
last
charitable
opinion
she
heard
expressed
positively
and
acted
upon
it
it
was
malcomson
who
spoke
to
her
and
the
effect
of
what
she
said
was
instantaneous
for
the
old
lady
bridled
visibly
and
then
set
out
accompanied
by
edith
with
the
obvious
intention
of
heading
the
relief
party
herself
that
very
minute
she
stationed
herself
beside
clarence
and
stood
patting
the
poor
girl
hand
with
motherly
tenderness
smiling
at
her
and
saying
conventional
nothings
in
a
most
cordial
manner
colonel
colquhoun
had
watched
these
proceedings
understanding
them
perfectly
but
remaining
impassive
as
at
first
and
guthrie
brimston
had
also
seen
signs
of
the
the
moment
it
set
in
and
shown
her
astonishment
she
was
not
accustomed
to
be
checked
in
full
career
when
it
pleased
her
to
be
down
upon
another
woman
and
she
did
quite
know
what
to
do
she
looked
first
at
colonel
colquhoun
inviting
him
to
rejoin
her
but
he
ignored
the
glance
and
she
therefore
found
herself
obliged
either
to
give
him
up
or
to
go
to
him
she
decided
to
go
to
him
and
set
out
attended
by
her
own
bobbie
by
the
time
she
had
reached
him
however
the
last
act
of
the
little
play
had
begun
evadne
was
standing
apart
with
captain
clarence
looking
up
at
him
and
speaking
with
her
usual
unimpassioned
calm
to
judge
by
the
expression
of
her
face
but
guthrie
brimston
had
begun
to
realize
that
when
evadne
did
speak
it
was
to
some
purpose
and
she
watched
now
and
awaited
the
event
in
evident
trepidation
she
not
telling
him
she
never
would
dare
to
slipped
from
her
unawares
they
are
coming
this
way
colonel
colquhoun
observed
significantly
i
shall
go
cried
mrs
guthrie
brimston
come
bobbie
it
was
too
late
however
they
were
surrounded
be
good
enough
to
remain
a
moment
captain
clarence
exclaimed
authoritatively
then
turning
to
colonel
colquhoun
he
said
i
understand
that
these
people
have
in
their
possession
a
letter
containing
a
foul
slander
against
my
wife
and
myself
and
that
they
have
been
using
it
to
injure
us
in
the
estimation
of
everybody
here
if
it
be
possible
sir
i
should
like
to
have
an
official
inquiry
instituted
into
the
circumstances
of
my
marriage
at
once
very
well
captain
clarence
colonel
colquhoun
answered
ceremoniously
i
apologise
major
guthrie
brimston
gasped
but
captain
clarence
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
back
to
his
wife
as
if
he
had
not
heard
how
the
inquiry
was
conducted
was
not
made
public
but
when
it
was
that
the
clarences
had
been
cleared
and
that
the
guthrie
brimstons
had
not
suffered
society
declared
it
to
have
been
a
case
of
six
of
one
and
of
the
other
which
left
matters
exactly
where
they
were
before
those
who
chose
to
believe
in
the
calumny
continued
to
do
so
and
the
only
difference
being
that
evadne
generous
action
in
the
matter
brought
blame
upon
herself
from
one
set
and
also
what
was
worse
brought
her
into
a
kind
of
vogue
with
another
which
would
have
caused
her
to
rage
had
she
understood
it
for
the
story
that
she
had
said
things
which
no
woman
could
repeat
added
to
the
fact
that
she
was
seen
everywhere
with
a
lady
whose
reputation
had
been
attacked
made
men
of
a
certain
class
feel
a
sudden
interest
in
her
birds
of
a
feather
they
maintained
then
spoke
of
her
slightingly
in
public
places
and
sent
her
bouquets
innumerable
her
next
decided
action
however
put
an
effectual
stop
to
this
nuisance
chapter
ix
colonel
colquhoun
came
to
evadne
one
day
and
asked
her
if
she
would
not
go
out
she
put
down
her
work
rose
at
once
smiling
and
declared
that
she
should
be
delighted
there
had
been
a
big
regimental
guest
night
the
day
before
and
colonel
colquhoun
had
dined
at
mess
and
was
consequently
irritable
acquiescence
is
as
provoking
as
opposition
to
a
man
in
that
mood
and
he
chose
to
take
offence
at
evadne
evident
anxiety
to
please
him
she
makes
quite
a
business
of
being
agreeable
to
me
he
reflected
while
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
put
her
hat
on
she
requires
me
to
be
on
my
good
behaviour
as
if
i
were
a
out
for
a
and
thinks
it
her
duty
to
entertain
me
by
way
of
reward
i
suppose
and
thereupon
he
set
himself
determinedly
against
being
entertained
and
accordingly
when
evadne
rejoined
him
and
made
some
cheerful
remark
he
responded
to
it
with
a
sullen
grunt
which
did
small
credit
to
his
manners
either
as
a
man
or
a
gentleman
and
naturally
checked
the
endeavour
for
the
moment
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
as
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
converse
she
showed
her
respect
for
his
mood
by
being
silent
herself
but
this
was
too
much
for
him
he
stood
it
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
he
burst
out
do
you
never
talk
i
do
know
she
said
surprised
do
you
like
talkative
women
i
like
a
woman
to
have
something
to
say
for
herself
while
evadne
was
trying
in
her
slow
way
to
see
precisely
what
he
meant
by
this
little
outbreak
they
met
one
of
the
officers
of
the
regiment
escorting
a
very
showy
young
woman
and
as
everybody
in
malta
knows
everybody
else
in
society
and
this
was
a
stranger
evadne
asked
more
however
to
oblige
colonel
colquhoun
by
making
a
remark
than
because
she
felt
the
slightest
curiosity
on
the
subject
who
is
that
with
finchley
a
new
arrival
i
suppose
oh
only
a
girl
he
brought
out
from
england
with
him
colonel
colquhoun
answered
coarsely
staring
hard
at
the
girl
as
he
spoke
and
forgetting
himself
for
once
in
his
extreme
irritability
he
ought
not
to
bring
her
here
though
he
added
carelessly
finchley
had
passed
them
hanging
his
head
and
pretending
not
to
see
them
evadne
flushed
crimson
do
you
mean
that
he
brought
out
a
girl
he
is
not
married
to
and
is
living
with
her
here
she
asked
that
is
the
position
exactly
colonel
colquhoun
rejoined
and
i
see
him
in
the
orderly
room
and
interview
him
on
the
subject
he
has
no
business
to
parade
her
publicly
where
the
other
fellows
wives
may
meet
her
and
i
not
have
it
evadne
said
no
more
but
there
was
a
ball
that
evening
and
during
an
interval
between
the
dances
when
she
was
standing
beside
colonel
colquhoun
and
several
ladies
in
a
prominent
position
and
much
observed
for
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
she
was
at
the
height
of
her
unenviable
vogue
finchley
came
op
and
asked
her
to
dance
she
had
drawn
herself
up
proudly
as
he
approached
and
having
looked
at
him
deliberately
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
there
was
no
mistaking
her
intention
colonel
colquhoun
hand
paused
on
its
way
to
twirl
his
blond
moustache
and
there
was
a
perceptible
sensation
in
the
room
captain
belliot
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
deceived
in
an
honest
endeavour
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
and
is
disheartened
she
took
me
in
completely
he
said
i
should
never
have
guessed
she
was
that
kind
of
woman
what
is
society
coming
to
she
must
be
deuced
herself
you
know
or
she
would
have
known
finchley
had
a
woman
out
with
him
said
major
livingston
whom
guthrie
brimston
called
lady
betty
because
of
his
nice
precise
little
ways
with
ladies
oh
trust
a
prude
said
captain
brown
they
spy
out
all
the
beastliness
that
going
colonel
colquhoun
did
not
take
this
last
proof
of
evadne
peculiar
views
at
all
well
he
was
becoming
even
more
sensitive
as
he
grew
older
to
what
fellows
say
or
think
and
he
was
therefore
considerably
annoyed
by
her
conduct
so
much
so
indeed
that
he
actually
spoke
to
her
upon
the
subject
himself
people
will
say
that
i
have
married
grundy
he
grumbled
i
suppose
so
she
answered
tranquilly
you
see
i
do
not
feel
at
all
about
these
things
as
you
do
i
wish
you
feel
as
i
do
but
seeing
that
you
can
not
it
is
fortunate
is
it
not
that
we
are
not
really
married
it
sounds
as
if
you
were
congratulating
yourself
upon
the
fact
of
our
position
he
said
but
do
congratulate
yourself
she
answered
in
surprise
surely
you
have
had
as
narrow
an
escape
as
i
had
you
would
have
been
miserable
too
he
made
no
answer
it
is
perhaps
easier
to
resign
an
inferior
husband
than
a
superior
wife
but
he
let
the
subject
drop
then
for
the
moment
only
for
the
moment
however
for
later
in
the
day
he
had
a
conversation
with
guthrie
brimston
that
little
business
about
the
clarences
had
not
interrupted
the
intimacy
between
colonel
colquhoun
and
the
guthrie
brimstons
how
could
it
guthrie
brimston
was
as
amusing
as
ever
and
colonel
colquhoun
remained
in
command
of
a
crack
regiment
and
was
a
handsome
man
well
and
soldier
like
into
the
bargain
it
was
evadne
who
had
caused
all
the
annoyance
and
consequently
there
was
really
no
excuse
for
a
rupture
especially
as
evadne
met
the
guthrie
brimstons
herself
with
as
much
complacency
as
ever
colonel
colquhoun
had
gone
to
guthrie
brimston
that
afternoon
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
the
advisability
of
getting
some
experienced
woman
of
the
world
to
speak
to
evadne
with
a
view
to
putting
a
stop
to
her
nonsense
and
the
consultation
ended
with
an
offer
from
guthrie
brimston
to
undertake
the
task
herself
her
interference
however
produced
not
the
slightest
effect
on
evadne
chapter
x
those
who
can
contemplate
certain
phases
of
life
and
still
believe
that
there
is
a
divine
providence
ordering
all
things
for
the
best
will
see
its
action
in
the
combination
of
circumstances
which
placed
evadne
in
the
midst
of
a
community
where
she
must
meet
the
spirit
of
evil
face
to
face
continually
and
since
acquiescence
was
impossible
forced
her
to
develop
her
own
strength
by
steady
and
determined
resistance
but
her
position
was
more
than
difficult
it
was
desperate
there
was
scarcely
one
even
amongst
the
most
indulgent
of
her
friends
who
did
not
misunderstand
her
and
blame
her
at
times
she
kept
the
pendulum
of
public
opinion
swaying
vehemently
during
the
whole
of
her
first
season
in
malta
major
livingston
shook
his
head
about
her
from
the
first
i
ca
get
on
with
her
he
said
as
if
the
fact
were
not
at
all
to
her
credit
he
was
a
survival
himself
one
of
the
kind
of
military
men
who
were
all
formed
on
the
same
plan
they
got
their
uniform
their
politics
their
vices
and
their
code
of
honour
cut
and
dried
upon
entering
the
service
and
occasionally
left
the
latter
with
their
agents
to
be
taken
care
of
for
them
while
they
served
evadne
gave
offence
to
representatives
of
the
next
generation
also
seeing
that
she
was
young
and
attractive
it
was
clearly
her
duty
to
think
only
of
meriting
their
attention
and
when
she
was
discovered
time
after
time
during
a
ball
hanging
quite
affectionately
on
the
arm
of
austin
b
price
a
dried
up
old
american
and
pacing
the
balcony
to
and
fro
with
him
in
the
moonlight
by
the
hour
together
when
there
were
plenty
of
young
fellows
who
wanted
to
dance
with
her
and
when
worse
still
it
was
observed
that
she
was
serenely
happy
on
these
occasions
listening
to
austin
b
price
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
or
even
and
actually
talking
herself
why
they
declared
she
was
womanly
she
could
be
john
was
one
of
the
friends
who
very
much
deprecated
attitude
at
this
time
he
did
not
speak
to
her
himself
being
diffident
and
delicate
but
he
went
to
price
who
was
he
knew
quite
in
her
confidence
you
have
influence
with
her
restrain
her
he
said
no
good
is
done
by
making
herself
the
subject
of
common
gossip
my
dear
fellow
price
replied
she
is
quite
irresponsible
certain
powers
of
perception
have
developed
in
her
to
a
point
beyond
that
which
has
been
reached
by
the
people
about
her
and
she
is
forced
to
act
up
to
what
she
perceives
to
be
right
they
blame
her
because
they
can
not
see
so
far
in
advance
of
themselves
and
she
has
small
patience
with
them
for
not
at
once
recognizing
the
use
and
propriety
of
what
comes
so
easily
and
naturally
to
her
so
far
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
her
surely
but
further
than
that
it
is
impossible
to
go
because
she
is
as
yet
an
incomplete
creature
in
a
state
of
progression
with
fair
play
she
should
continue
on
but
on
the
other
hand
her
development
may
be
entirely
arrested
it
is
curious
that
priesthoods
while
preaching
perfection
invariably
do
their
best
to
stop
progress
you
will
never
believe
that
any
change
is
for
the
better
until
it
is
accomplished
and
there
is
no
denying
it
and
so
you
hinder
forever
when
you
should
be
the
first
to
help
and
encourage
and
you
are
bringing
yourselves
into
disrepute
by
it
just
try
and
realize
the
difference
between
the
position
and
powers
of
judgment
of
women
now
and
that
which
obtained
among
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
think
too
of
the
hard
battles
they
have
had
to
fight
for
every
inch
of
the
way
they
have
made
and
of
the
desperate
resolution
with
which
they
have
stood
their
ground
always
advancing
never
receding
and
with
supernumeraries
ready
whenever
one
falls
out
exhausted
to
step
in
and
take
her
place
however
dangerous
it
may
be
oh
i
tell
you
man
women
are
grand
grand
but
i
do
see
how
we
have
imposed
upon
women
john
objected
i
can
show
you
in
a
minute
price
rejoined
twitching
his
face
it
was
the
submission
business
you
know
to
begin
with
not
so
many
years
ago
we
men
had
only
to
insist
that
a
thing
was
either
right
or
necessary
and
women
believed
it
and
meekly
acquiesced
in
it
we
told
them
they
were
fools
to
us
and
they
believed
it
and
we
told
them
they
were
angels
of
light
and
purity
and
goodness
whose
mission
it
was
to
marry
and
reform
us
and
above
all
pity
and
sympathize
with
us
when
we
defiled
ourselves
because
we
could
help
it
and
they
believed
it
we
told
them
they
did
really
care
for
moral
probity
in
man
and
they
believed
it
we
told
them
they
had
no
brains
that
they
were
illogical
unreasoning
and
incapable
of
thought
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
by
jove
they
took
all
that
for
granted
such
was
their
beautiful
confidence
in
us
and
never
even
to
think
until
one
day
when
quite
by
accident
i
feel
sure
one
of
them
found
herself
arriving
at
logical
conclusions
involuntarily
her
brain
was
a
rich
soil
although
untilled
which
began
to
teem
of
its
own
accord
and
that
my
dear
fellow
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
old
state
of
things
but
i
believe
myself
that
all
this
unrest
and
rebellion
against
the
old
established
abuses
amongst
women
is
simply
an
effort
of
nature
to
improve
the
race
the
men
of
the
present
day
will
have
a
bad
time
if
they
resist
the
onward
impulse
but
in
any
case
the
men
of
the
future
will
have
good
reason
to
arise
and
call
their
mothers
blessed
to
you
do
interfere
with
evadne
and
think
just
watch
and
and
pray
if
you
like
the
old
gentleman
smiled
and
twitched
his
face
when
he
had
spoken
and
they
shook
hands
and
parted
in
complete
disagreement
as
was
usually
the
case
chapter
xi
when
any
difference
of
opinion
arose
between
evadne
and
colonel
colquhoun
they
discussed
it
tranquilly
as
a
rule
and
with
much
forbearance
upon
either
side
and
having
done
so
the
subject
was
allowed
to
drop
they
each
generally
remained
of
the
same
opinion
still
but
neither
would
interfere
with
the
other
afterward
had
he
had
anything
in
him
could
he
have
made
her
feel
him
to
be
superior
in
any
way
she
must
have
grown
to
love
him
with
passion
once
more
but
as
it
was
he
remained
only
an
erring
in
her
estimation
for
whom
she
grew
gradually
to
feel
both
pity
and
affection
it
is
true
but
toward
whom
her
attitude
generally
speaking
was
that
of
most
polite
indifference
she
had
her
moments
of
rage
however
there
were
whole
days
when
her
patient
tolerance
of
the
position
gave
way
and
one
wild
longing
to
be
free
pursued
her
but
she
made
no
sign
on
such
occasions
only
sat
with
lips
severely
placid
felt
the
knot
climb
in
her
throat
and
with
her
foot
unseen
crushed
the
wild
passion
out
against
the
floor
beneath
the
banquet
where
the
meats
become
as
wormwood
and
uttered
not
a
word
yet
there
was
nothing
in
colonel
manner
nothing
in
his
treatment
of
her
in
the
least
objectionable
what
she
suffered
from
was
simply
contact
with
an
inferior
moral
body
and
the
intellectual
starvation
inevitable
in
constant
association
with
a
mind
too
shallow
to
contain
any
sort
of
mental
sustenance
for
the
sharing
the
pleasing
fact
that
he
and
evadne
were
getting
on
very
well
together
dawned
on
him
quite
suddenly
one
day
but
it
was
she
who
perceived
that
the
absence
of
friction
was
entirely
due
to
the
restriction
which
polite
society
imposes
upon
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
in
ordinary
everyday
intercourse
when
their
bond
is
not
the
bond
of
man
and
wife
i
should
say
we
are
very
good
friends
evadne
should
you
he
remarked
in
a
cheerful
tone
yes
she
responded
cordially
they
were
both
in
evening
dress
when
this
occurred
she
sitting
beside
a
table
with
one
bare
arm
resting
upon
it
toying
with
the
tassel
of
her
fan
he
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
looking
down
upon
her
it
was
after
dinner
and
they
were
lingering
over
their
coffee
until
it
should
be
time
to
stroll
in
for
an
hour
or
so
to
the
opera
he
said
after
a
pause
have
you
read
any
of
those
books
i
got
for
you
any
of
the
french
ones
her
face
set
somewhat
but
she
looked
up
at
him
and
answered
without
hesitation
yes
i
have
read
the
terre
bovary
and
she
stopped
there
and
he
then
waited
in
vain
for
her
to
express
an
opinion
well
he
said
at
last
what
has
struck
you
most
in
them
the
suffering
george
she
exclaimed
awful
needless
suffering
it
was
a
veritable
cry
of
anguish
and
as
she
spoke
she
threw
her
arms
forward
upon
the
table
beside
which
she
was
sitting
laid
her
face
down
on
them
and
burst
into
passionate
sobs
colonel
colquhoun
bit
his
lip
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
the
girl
in
that
way
at
all
events
he
took
a
step
toward
her
hesitated
not
knowing
quite
what
to
do
and
finally
left
the
room
when
next
evadne
went
to
her
bookshelves
she
discovered
a
great
gap
the
whole
of
those
dangerous
works
of
fiction
had
disappeared
chapter
xii
colonel
colquhoun
had
gradually
fallen
into
the
habit
of
riding
out
or
walking
alone
with
guthrie
brimston
continually
and
of
course
people
began
to
make
much
of
the
intimacy
and
to
talk
of
the
way
he
neglected
his
poor
young
wife
but
the
only
part
of
the
arrangement
which
was
not
agreeable
to
the
latter
was
having
to
entertain
major
guthrie
brimston
sometimes
during
his
lady
absence
and
the
lady
herself
when
she
stayed
to
tea
for
there
was
really
no
harm
in
the
flirtation
as
evadne
was
acute
enough
to
perceive
guthrie
brimston
was
one
of
those
women
who
pride
themselves
upon
having
a
train
of
admirers
and
are
not
above
robbing
other
women
of
the
companionship
of
their
husbands
in
order
to
swell
their
own
following
while
many
men
rather
affect
the
society
of
these
ladies
because
they
are
not
a
bit
stiff
you
know
and
allow
a
certain
laxity
of
language
which
is
particularly
piquant
to
the
masculine
mind
when
the
complacent
lady
is
no
relation
and
is
really
all
right
herself
you
know
guthrie
brimston
was
really
quite
right
you
know
she
and
her
husband
understood
each
other
perfectly
while
evadne
on
her
part
was
content
to
know
that
colonel
colquhoun
was
so
innocently
occupied
for
she
was
beginning
to
think
of
him
as
a
kind
of
big
child
of
weak
moral
purpose
for
whose
good
behaviour
she
would
be
held
responsible
and
it
was
a
relief
when
guthrie
brimston
took
him
off
her
hands
no
human
being
likes
to
dwell
on
the
misery
which
another
is
suffering
or
has
suffered
and
it
is
therefore
a
comfort
to
know
that
upon
the
whole
at
this
period
of
her
life
evadne
was
not
at
all
unhappy
she
had
her
friends
her
pleasures
and
her
occupations
the
latter
being
multifarious
the
climate
of
malta
at
that
time
of
the
year
suited
her
to
perfection
and
the
picturesque
place
with
its
romantic
history
and
strange
traditions
was
in
itself
an
unfailing
source
of
interest
and
delight
to
her
dear
old
beale
had
kept
her
heart
from
hardening
into
bitterness
just
by
loving
her
and
giving
her
a
good
motherly
hug
now
and
then
when
evadne
was
inclined
to
rail
she
would
say
pity
the
wicked
people
my
dear
pity
them
pity
does
more
good
in
the
world
than
blame
however
well
deserved
you
may
soften
a
sinner
by
pitying
him
but
never
by
hard
words
and
once
you
melt
into
the
mood
of
pity
yourself
you
will
be
able
to
endure
things
which
would
otherwise
drive
you
mad
malcomson
helped
her
too
during
that
first
burst
of
unpopularity
which
she
brought
upon
herself
by
daring
to
act
upon
her
own
perception
of
right
and
wrong
in
defiance
of
the
old
established
injustices
of
society
when
even
the
most
kindly
disposed
hung
back
suspiciously
not
knowing
what
dangerous
sort
of
a
new
creature
she
might
eventually
prove
herself
to
be
at
the
earliest
mutter
of
that
storm
malcomson
came
forward
boldly
to
support
evadne
and
so
also
did
sillinger
john
was
another
of
evadne
particular
friends
he
had
injured
his
health
by
excessive
devotion
to
his
duties
and
been
sent
to
malta
in
the
hope
that
the
warm
bright
climate
might
strengthen
his
chest
which
was
his
weak
point
and
restore
him
but
it
was
not
really
the
right
place
for
him
and
he
had
continued
delicate
throughout
the
winter
and
required
little
attentions
which
evadne
was
happily
able
to
pay
him
and
in
this
way
their
early
acquaintance
had
rapidly
ripened
into
intimacy
he
was
a
clever
man
in
his
own
profession
of
exceptional
piety
but
narrow
which
did
not
however
prevent
him
from
being
congenial
to
one
side
of
nature
she
had
never
doubted
her
religion
it
was
a
thing
apart
from
all
her
knowledge
and
opinions
something
to
be
essentially
not
as
anything
but
a
pleasurable
and
elevating
sensation
or
considered
except
in
the
way
of
referring
all
that
is
noble
in
thought
and
action
to
the
divine
nature
of
its
origin
and
influence
and
she
preserved
her
deep
reverence
for
the
priesthood
intact
and
found
both
comfort
and
spiritual
sustenance
in
their
ministrations
she
still
leaned
to
ritual
and
john
was
a
ritualist
so
that
they
had
much
in
common
and
while
she
was
able
to
pay
him
many
attentions
and
show
him
great
kindness
for
the
want
of
which
as
a
bachelor
and
an
invalid
in
a
foreign
place
he
must
have
suffered
in
his
feeble
state
of
health
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
take
her
out
of
herself
she
said
she
was
always
the
better
for
a
talk
with
him
and
certainly
the
delicate
dishes
and
wines
and
care
generally
which
she
lavished
upon
him
had
as
much
to
do
as
the
climate
with
the
benefit
he
derived
from
his
sojourn
in
malta
they
remained
firm
friends
always
and
many
years
afterward
when
he
had
become
one
of
the
most
distinguished
bishops
on
the
bench
he
was
able
from
the
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
her
character
which
he
had
gained
in
these
early
days
to
do
her
signal
service
and
save
her
from
much
stupid
misrepresentation
and
last
among
her
friends
although
one
of
the
greatest
was
austin
b
price
evadne
owed
this
kind
chivalrous
gentleman
much
gratitude
and
repaid
him
with
much
affection
he
was
really
the
first
to
discover
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
about
her
and
it
was
to
him
she
also
owed
a
considerable
further
development
of
her
originally
feeble
sense
of
humour
price
first
impression
that
she
was
an
uncommon
character
had
been
confirmed
by
one
of
those
rapid
phrases
of
hers
which
contained
in
a
few
words
the
embodiment
of
feelings
familiar
to
a
multitude
of
people
who
have
no
power
to
express
them
she
delivered
it
the
third
time
they
met
which
happened
to
be
at
another
of
those
afternoon
dances
held
on
board
the
flag
ship
on
that
occasion
colonel
colquhoun
liked
her
to
show
herself
although
she
did
not
dance
in
the
afternoon
so
she
was
there
sitting
out
and
price
was
courteously
endeavouring
to
entertain
her
it
surprises
me
he
said
as
an
american
to
find
so
little
inclination
in
your
free
and
enlightened
country
to
do
away
with
your
politically
speaking
useless
and
extremely
expensive
royal
house
well
you
see
said
evadne
we
are
deeply
attached
to
our
royal
house
and
we
can
well
afford
to
keep
it
up
it
was
this
glimpse
of
the
heart
of
the
proud
and
patriotic
little
aristocrat
true
daughter
of
a
nation
great
enough
to
disdain
small
economies
and
not
accustomed
to
do
without
any
luxury
to
which
it
is
attached
that
appealed
to
price
pleasing
the
pride
of
race
with
which
we
contemplate
any
evidence
of
strength
in
our
whether
it
be
strength
of
purpose
or
strength
of
passion
more
than
it
shocked
his
utilitarian
prejudices
when
it
was
evident
that
evadne
had
brought
a
good
deal
that
was
disagreeable
upon
herself
by
her
action
in
the
matter
of
the
clarences
old
beale
came
to
her
one
day
in
all
kindliness
to
tell
her
the
private
opinion
of
the
friends
who
had
stood
by
her
loyally
in
public
i
am
sure
you
did
it
with
the
best
motive
my
dear
and
it
was
bravely
done
the
old
lady
said
patting
her
hand
but
be
advised
by
those
who
know
the
world
and
have
had
more
experience
than
you
have
had
interfere
again
interference
does
no
good
and
people
will
say
such
things
if
you
do
they
will
make
you
pay
for
your
disinterestedness
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
not
i
have
to
pay
but
i
not
bound
to
pay
evadne
rejoined
neglecting
to
do
what
is
to
me
obviously
the
right
thing
and
making
no
endeavour
but
such
as
is
sure
to
be
applauded
working
in
the
hope
of
a
reward
in
fact
seems
to
me
to
be
a
terribly
idea
miserable
remnant
of
the
bribery
and
corruption
of
the
dark
ages
when
the
people
were
kept
in
such
dense
ignorance
that
they
could
be
treated
like
children
and
told
if
they
were
good
they
should
have
this
for
a
prize
but
if
they
were
bad
they
should
be
punished
you
are
quite
right
i
am
sure
my
dear
rejoined
beale
but
all
the
same
i
do
think
i
should
interfere
again
if
i
were
you
it
seems
that
i
have
not
done
the
clarences
any
good
evadne
murmured
one
day
to
price
well
that
was
hardly
to
be
expected
he
answered
at
which
she
raised
her
eyebrows
interrogatively
calumnies
which
attach
themselves
to
a
name
in
a
moment
take
a
lifetime
to
remove
because
such
a
large
majority
of
people
prefer
to
think
the
worst
of
each
other
the
clarences
will
have
to
live
down
their
own
little
difficulty
and
what
you
have
to
consider
now
is
not
how
little
benefit
they
have
derived
from
your
brave
defense
of
them
but
how
many
other
people
you
may
have
saved
from
similar
attacks
i
fancy
it
will
be
some
time
before
people
will
venture
to
spread
scandals
of
the
kind
here
in
malta
again
you
have
taught
them
a
lesson
you
may
be
sure
of
that
so
do
be
disheartened
and
lose
sight
of
the
final
result
in
consideration
of
immediate
consequences
the
hard
part
of
teaching
is
that
the
teacher
himself
seldom
sees
anything
of
the
good
he
has
done
it
was
very
evident
at
this
time
that
evadne
view
of
life
was
becoming
much
too
serious
for
her
own
good
and
perceiving
this
price
let
fall
some
words
one
day
in
the
course
of
conversation
which
she
afterward
treasured
in
her
heart
to
great
advantage
it
is
our
duty
to
be
happy
he
said
every
human
being
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
in
life
but
in
order
to
be
happy
you
must
think
of
the
world
as
a
mischievous
big
child
let
your
attitude
be
one
of
amused
contempt
so
long
as
you
detect
no
vice
in
the
mischief
once
you
do
however
if
you
have
the
gift
of
language
use
it
lash
out
unmercifully
and
do
desist
because
the
creature
howls
at
you
the
louder
it
howls
the
more
you
may
congratulate
yourself
that
you
have
touched
it
on
the
right
spot
which
is
sure
to
be
tender
but
he
did
not
limit
his
kindly
attentions
to
the
giving
of
good
advice
in
fact
he
very
seldom
gave
advice
at
all
what
he
chiefly
did
was
to
devise
distractions
for
her
which
should
take
her
out
of
herself
and
one
of
these
was
a
children
party
which
he
induced
her
to
give
at
christmas
the
party
was
to
take
place
on
christmas
eve
and
the
whole
of
the
day
before
and
far
into
the
night
the
colquhoun
house
was
thronged
with
actors
rehearsing
charades
and
tableaux
and
officers
painting
and
preparing
decorations
and
putting
them
up
all
were
in
the
highest
spirits
the
talk
and
laughter
were
incessant
the
work
was
being
done
with
a
will
and
none
of
them
looked
as
if
they
had
ever
had
a
sorrowful
thought
in
their
lives
least
of
all
evadne
whose
gaiety
seemed
the
most
spontaneous
of
all
late
at
night
she
had
come
to
the
hall
with
nails
for
the
decorators
and
was
handing
them
up
as
they
were
wanted
by
those
on
the
ladders
the
men
were
in
their
shirt
sleeves
the
most
becoming
dress
that
a
gentleman
ever
appears
in
and
during
a
pause
she
happened
to
notice
colonel
colquhoun
who
had
stepped
back
to
judge
the
effect
of
some
drapery
he
was
putting
up
price
was
a
little
behind
him
and
two
of
the
younger
men
the
three
making
an
excellent
foil
to
colonel
colquhoun
evadne
was
struck
by
the
contrast
the
outside
aspect
of
the
man
still
pleased
her
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
his
species
a
splendid
animal
to
look
at
what
a
pity
he
should
have
had
a
regrettable
past
the
kind
of
past
too
which
can
never
be
over
and
done
with
a
returned
convict
is
always
a
returned
convict
and
a
vicious
man
reformed
is
not
repaired
by
the
process
the
stigma
is
in
his
blood
evadne
sighed
she
was
too
highly
tempered
a
creature
to
be
the
victim
of
any
one
passion
and
least
of
all
of
that
transient
state
of
feeling
miscalled
love
physical
attraction
moral
repulsion
that
was
what
she
was
suffering
from
and
now
involuntarily
she
sighed
a
sigh
of
rage
for
what
might
have
been
and
just
at
that
moment
colonel
colquhoun
happening
to
look
at
her
found
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
strange
expression
was
there
going
to
be
a
chance
for
him
after
all
he
did
not
understand
evadne
he
had
no
conception
of
the
human
possibility
of
anything
so
perfect
as
her
and
when
she
showed
no
feeling
he
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
because
she
had
none
but
during
the
games
next
day
he
obtained
a
glimpse
of
her
heart
which
surprised
him
she
had
paid
a
forfeit
and
in
order
to
redeem
it
she
was
requested
to
state
her
favourite
names
gentlemen
and
ladies
barbara
evelyn
julia
elizabeth
pauline
mary
bertram
and
evrard
she
answered
instantly
i
do
not
know
if
i
think
them
the
most
beautiful
names
but
they
are
the
ones
that
i
love
the
best
and
have
always
in
my
mind
colonel
colquhoun
countenance
set
upon
this
they
were
the
names
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
whom
she
never
mentioned
to
him
by
any
chance
and
whom
he
had
not
imagined
that
she
ever
thought
of
yet
it
seemed
that
they
were
always
in
her
mind
he
had
so
little
conception
of
the
depth
and
tenderness
of
her
nature
or
of
her
fidelity
that
had
he
been
required
to
put
his
feelings
on
the
subject
into
words
before
this
revelation
he
would
without
a
moment
hesitation
have
declared
her
to
be
cold
and
wanting
in
natural
affection
a
girl
with
views
and
no
heart
but
after
this
a
few
questions
and
a
very
little
observation
served
to
convince
him
that
she
not
only
cared
for
her
friends
especially
her
brothers
and
sisters
but
fretted
for
their
companionship
continually
in
secret
and
felt
the
separation
all
the
more
because
her
father
harsh
prohibition
was
still
in
force
and
none
of
them
were
allowed
to
write
to
her
her
mother
excepted
whose
letters
however
came
but
rarely
now
and
were
always
unsatisfactory
the
truth
was
that
the
poor
lady
had
relapsed
into
slavery
and
been
nagged
into
an
outward
show
of
acquiescence
in
her
husband
original
mandate
which
forbade
her
to
correspond
with
her
recalcitrant
daughter
and
in
her
attempts
to
conceal
her
relapse
from
the
latter
and
at
the
same
time
to
keep
frayling
quiet
under
the
conviction
that
her
submission
was
genuine
the
style
of
her
letters
suffered
considerably
and
their
numbers
tended
always
to
diminish
but
the
thing
that
touched
colonel
colquhoun
was
the
care
which
evadne
had
taken
to
conceal
her
trouble
from
him
the
fact
that
she
had
not
allowed
a
single
complaint
to
escape
her
or
made
a
sign
that
might
have
worried
him
by
implying
a
reproach
he
had
his
moments
of
good
feeling
however
and
his
kindly
impulses
too
being
as
already
asserted
anything
but
a
monster
and
under
the
influence
of
one
of
them
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
sharp
remonstrance
to
frayling
which
however
only
drew
from
that
gentleman
an
expression
of
his
sincere
admiration
for
his
generous
disposition
and
of
his
regret
that
a
daughter
of
his
should
behave
so
badly
to
one
who
could
show
himself
so
nobly
forgiving
with
a
reiteration
of
his
determination
however
not
to
countenance
her
until
she
should
come
to
her
senses
so
that
no
actual
good
was
done
although
doubtless
colonel
colquhoun
himself
was
the
better
for
acting
on
the
impulse
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
evadne
had
gradually
formed
a
party
of
her
own
and
was
making
his
house
a
centre
of
attraction
to
all
the
best
people
in
the
place
he
knew
that
such
support
was
an
evidence
of
her
strength
and
would
only
confirm
her
in
her
views
especially
when
even
those
who
had
opposed
her
most
bitterly
at
first
were
caught
intriguing
to
get
into
the
colquhoun
house
clique
but
naturally
he
was
gratified
by
a
position
which
reflected
credit
upon
himself
his
respect
for
evadne
increased
and
consequently
they
became
if
possible
better
friends
than
ever
chapter
xiii
on
the
day
following
her
children
party
evadne
went
to
see
edith
she
always
went
there
when
she
felt
and
and
came
away
refreshed
edith
ignorance
of
life
amazed
and
perplexed
her
she
thought
it
foolish
and
she
thought
it
unsafe
for
a
mature
young
woman
to
know
no
more
of
the
world
than
a
child
does
but
still
she
shrank
from
sharing
the
pain
of
her
own
knowledge
with
her
and
had
never
had
the
heart
to
say
a
word
that
might
disturb
her
beautiful
serenity
she
showed
some
selfishness
in
that
she
could
be
a
child
in
mind
again
with
edith
and
only
with
edith
and
it
was
really
for
her
own
pleasure
that
she
avoided
all
serious
discussion
with
the
latter
although
she
firmly
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
entirely
out
of
deference
to
wishes
and
prejudices
she
owed
a
great
deal
as
has
already
been
said
to
beale
when
her
attitude
began
to
attract
attention
and
provoked
criticism
the
old
lady
declined
emphatically
to
hear
a
word
against
her
from
anybody
and
so
supported
her
in
public
while
in
private
the
influence
of
her
sweet
womanliness
was
restraining
in
the
way
that
orton
beg
had
foreseen
it
was
a
check
upon
evadne
and
prevented
her
from
going
too
far
and
fast
at
a
time
argument
would
not
have
hindered
her
but
when
beale
was
present
she
often
suppressed
a
of
a
phrase
because
it
would
have
wounded
her
as
she
went
out
that
afternoon
she
met
old
lord
groome
on
the
doorstep
just
coming
to
call
on
her
and
hesitated
a
moment
between
asking
him
in
or
allowing
him
to
accompany
her
as
far
as
beale
but
decided
on
the
latter
because
she
would
get
rid
of
him
so
much
the
sooner
her
attitude
toward
him
however
was
kindly
and
tolerant
as
a
rule
and
she
was
even
amused
by
his
curious
conceit
he
was
always
ready
to
express
what
he
called
an
opinion
on
any
subject
but
more
especially
when
it
bore
reference
to
legislation
and
the
government
of
peoples
generally
for
he
was
comfortably
confident
that
he
had
inherited
the
brain
power
necessary
for
a
legislator
as
well
as
a
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
and
the
position
of
one
a
pardonable
error
surely
since
it
is
so
very
common
socially
he
lived
in
a
comfortable
conception
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
were
agreeable
to
him
morally
he
did
not
exist
at
all
religiously
he
supported
the
established
church
and
politically
he
believed
in
every
antiquated
error
still
extant
in
which
respect
most
of
his
friends
resembled
him
ah
and
so
you
are
going
to
see
miss
beale
that
right
he
observed
patronisingly
i
like
to
see
one
young
lady
with
her
work
in
her
hand
tripping
in
to
sit
and
chat
with
another
and
while
away
the
long
hours
till
the
gentlemen
return
one
can
imagine
all
their
little
jests
and
confidences
young
ladyhood
is
charming
to
contemplate
the
implication
that
a
young
lady
has
no
great
interest
in
life
but
in
the
return
of
the
gentlemen
and
that
while
awaiting
them
her
pursuits
must
of
necessity
be
petty
and
trivial
both
amused
and
provoked
evadne
and
she
answered
with
a
dry
enigmatical
a
few
steps
further
on
they
overtook
that
person
of
singular
views
malcomson
from
whom
lord
groome
would
have
fled
had
he
seen
her
in
time
for
they
detested
each
other
cordially
and
she
never
spared
him
she
was
strolling
along
alone
with
her
eyes
cast
down
humming
a
little
tune
to
herself
and
thinking
there
was
a
tinge
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
for
the
air
was
fresh
for
malta
her
eyes
were
bright
her
hair
as
usual
had
broken
from
bondage
into
little
brown
curls
all
crisp
and
shining
on
her
forehead
and
neck
and
her
lips
were
parted
as
if
they
only
waited
for
an
excuse
to
break
into
a
smile
a
healthier
pleasanter
happier
handsomer
young
woman
lord
groome
could
not
have
wished
to
encounter
and
consequently
his
disapproval
of
those
absurd
notions
of
hers
which
were
an
effectual
bar
sir
as
he
said
himself
the
kind
of
thing
that
destroys
a
woman
charm
and
makes
it
impossible
to
get
on
with
her
mounted
to
his
forehead
in
a
frown
of
perplexity
what
are
you
so
busy
about
evadne
asked
her
my
profession
she
answered
laconically
and
what
is
that
lord
groome
inquired
with
that
ponderous
affectation
of
playfulness
which
he
believed
to
be
acceptable
to
women
the
higher
education
of
man
she
rejoined
then
darted
down
a
side
street
laughing
i
am
afraid
you
are
too
intimate
with
that
lady
lord
groome
observed
severely
you
must
not
allow
yourself
to
be
bitten
by
her
revolutionary
ideas
she
is
a
dangerous
person
not
but
evolutionary
evadne
answered
smiling
yes
malcomson
has
taught
me
a
great
deal
she
is
a
very
remarkable
person
the
world
will
hear
more
of
her
i
am
sure
and
be
all
the
better
for
her
passage
through
it
but
here
we
are
thank
you
for
accompanying
me
what
a
hot
afternoon
she
shook
hands
with
him
then
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
leaving
him
outside
he
felt
the
dismissal
somewhat
summary
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
philosophically
and
walked
on
reflecting
of
malcomson
that
just
the
way
with
women
when
they
begin
to
have
ideas
they
spread
them
everywhere
and
all
the
other
women
in
the
neighbourhood
catch
them
and
are
spoiled
by
them
evadne
spirits
had
risen
in
the
open
air
but
the
moment
she
found
herself
alone
a
reaction
set
in
the
hall
was
dark
and
cool
and
she
stopped
there
thinking
oh
the
dissatisfaction
of
it
all
there
were
no
servants
about
and
the
house
seemed
curiously
still
she
heard
the
ripple
of
running
water
from
an
unseen
fountain
somewhere
and
the
intermittent
murmur
of
voices
in
a
room
close
by
but
there
is
a
silence
that
broods
above
such
sounds
and
this
it
was
that
evadne
felt
close
to
where
she
stood
was
a
divan
with
some
tall
foliage
plants
behind
it
and
she
sat
down
there
and
leaning
forward
with
her
arms
resting
on
her
knees
began
listlessly
to
trace
out
the
pattern
of
the
pavement
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
she
had
no
notion
why
she
was
lingering
there
alone
when
she
had
come
out
for
the
sole
purpose
of
not
being
alone
but
the
will
to
do
anything
else
had
suddenly
forsaken
her
her
mind
however
had
become
curiously
active
all
at
once
in
a
jerky
disconnected
sort
of
way
lord
groome
thank
heaven
for
having
got
rid
of
him
so
easily
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
more
difficult
poor
foolish
old
man
yes
it
is
ridiculous
that
the
destinies
of
nations
should
hang
on
the
size
of
one
man
liver
where
did
i
hear
that
now
it
seems
as
old
old
as
the
iniquity
itself
subjects
get
into
the
air
i
heard
someone
say
that
too
here
soon
after
i
came
out
who
was
it
oh
the
dance
on
the
malcomson
and
price
said
subjects
were
diseases
which
got
into
the
air
said
they
were
more
like
perfumes
now
should
not
have
compared
them
with
either
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
voices
had
been
murmuring
intermittently
opened
at
that
moment
and
edith
came
out
followed
by
menteith
it
was
a
vision
which
evadne
never
forgot
edith
was
dressed
in
ivory
white
and
wore
a
brooch
of
turquoise
and
diamonds
at
her
throat
a
buckle
of
the
same
at
her
waist
and
a
very
handsome
ring
also
of
turquoise
and
diamonds
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
evadne
took
the
ornaments
in
at
a
glance
she
had
seen
all
that
edith
had
hitherto
possessed
and
these
were
new
but
she
did
not
for
a
moment
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
it
was
edith
radiant
face
that
riveted
her
attention
a
bright
flush
flickered
on
her
delicate
cheek
deepening
or
fading
at
every
breath
her
large
eyes
floated
in
light
even
the
bright
strands
of
her
yellow
hair
shone
with
unusual
lustre
her
step
was
so
buoyant
she
scarcely
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
at
all
she
was
all
shy
smiles
and
as
she
came
with
her
slender
white
right
hand
she
played
with
the
new
ring
she
wore
on
her
left
fingering
it
nervously
but
anyone
more
ecstatically
happy
than
she
seemed
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
menteith
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
he
seemed
to
gloat
over
every
item
of
her
appearance
oh
here
is
evadne
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
welcome
running
up
to
the
latter
and
kissing
her
with
peculiar
tenderness
then
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
menteith
then
back
again
at
evadne
wanting
to
say
something
but
not
liking
to
with
a
start
of
surprise
evadne
awoke
to
the
significance
of
all
this
and
she
knew
too
what
was
expected
of
her
but
she
could
not
say
i
congratulate
you
try
as
she
would
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
drawing
room
was
all
she
was
able
to
gasp
and
she
hastened
off
in
that
direction
as
she
spoke
how
can
you
care
so
much
for
that
cold
unsympathetic
woman
menteith
exclaimed
she
is
not
cold
and
unsympathetic
edith
rejoined
emphatically
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
wrong
i
must
go
and
see
what
it
is
o
mosley
i
feel
all
chilled
it
is
a
bad
omen
this
is
a
bad
damp
hall
he
answered
laughing
at
her
you
are
too
sensitive
to
changes
of
temperature
it
seemed
so
really
for
her
colour
had
faded
and
she
had
not
recovered
it
when
she
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
evadne
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
alone
waiting
for
her
edith
you
are
not
going
to
marry
that
dreadful
man
she
exclaimed
edith
stopped
short
astonished
she
gasped
yon
must
be
mad
evadne
beale
came
into
the
room
just
as
edith
uttered
these
words
and
overheard
them
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
happy
smiles
and
tears
expecting
kind
congratulations
but
at
the
tone
of
edith
voice
almost
more
than
at
what
she
had
said
and
at
the
sight
of
the
two
girls
standing
a
little
apart
looking
into
each
other
faces
in
alarm
and
horror
her
own
countenance
changed
and
an
expression
of
blank
inquiry
succeeded
the
smiles
and
dried
the
tears
oh
mrs
beale
evadne
entreated
you
are
not
going
to
let
edith
marry
that
dreadful
man
mother
she
will
keep
saying
that
edith
exclaimed
my
dear
child
what
you
mean
beale
said
gently
to
evadne
taking
her
hand
i
mean
that
he
is
bad
thoroughly
bad
said
evadne
why
now
tell
me
what
do
you
know
about
him
the
old
lady
asked
leading
evadne
to
a
sofa
and
making
her
sit
down
beside
her
upon
it
her
manner
was
always
excessively
soothing
and
the
first
heat
of
indignation
began
to
subside
as
she
came
under
the
influence
of
it
i
do
know
anything
about
him
she
answered
confusedly
but
i
like
the
way
he
looks
at
me
oh
come
now
that
is
childish
beale
said
smiling
no
it
is
not
i
am
sure
it
is
not
evadne
rejoined
knitting
her
brows
in
a
fruitless
endeavour
to
grasp
some
idea
that
evaded
her
some
item
of
information
that
had
slipped
from
her
mind
i
feel
i
have
a
consciousness
which
informs
me
of
things
my
intellect
can
not
grasp
and
i
know
she
exclaimed
her
mental
vision
clearing
as
she
proceeded
i
have
heard
colonel
colquhoun
drop
hints
and
you
would
condemn
him
upon
hints
edith
interjected
contemptuously
i
know
that
if
colonel
colquhoun
hints
that
there
is
something
objectionable
about
a
man
it
must
be
something
very
objectionable
indeed
evadne
answered
cooling
suddenly
edith
turned
crimson
evadne
beale
remonstrated
patting
her
hand
emphatically
to
restrain
her
edith
has
accepted
him
because
she
loves
him
and
that
is
enough
if
it
were
love
it
would
be
evadne
answered
but
it
is
not
love
she
feels
prove
to
her
that
this
man
is
not
a
fit
companion
for
her
and
she
will
droop
for
a
while
and
then
recover
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
you
separated
them
for
years
without
breaking
off
the
engagement
love
which
lasts
is
a
condition
of
the
mature
mind
it
is
a
fine
compound
of
inclination
and
knowledge
controlled
by
reason
which
makes
the
object
of
it
not
a
thing
of
haphazard
but
a
matter
of
choice
beale
she
reiterated
you
will
not
let
edith
marry
that
dreadful
man
my
dear
child
beale
replied
speaking
with
angelic
mildness
your
mind
is
quite
perverted
on
this
subject
and
how
it
comes
to
be
so
i
can
not
imagine
for
your
mother
is
one
of
the
sweetest
truest
most
long
suffering
women
i
ever
knew
and
so
is
lady
adeline
and
orton
beg
you
have
been
brought
up
among
womanly
women
none
of
whom
ever
even
such
things
as
you
do
not
hesitate
to
utter
i
am
sure
i
once
heard
a
discussion
between
lady
adeline
and
aunt
olive
evadne
rejoined
it
was
about
a
lady
who
had
a
very
bad
husband
and
had
patiently
endured
a
great
deal
is
beautiful
pathetic
pitiful
to
see
a
woman
making
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
in
that
way
aunt
olive
said
may
be
all
that
lady
adeline
answered
is
it
right
if
this
generation
would
object
to
bad
bargains
the
next
would
have
fewer
to
make
the
best
of
ah
that
is
so
like
dear
adeline
beale
observed
but
what
a
memory
you
have
my
dear
to
be
able
to
give
the
exact
words
evadne
countenance
fell
she
was
disheartened
but
still
she
persisted
it
is
you
good
women
she
said
clasping
beale
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
holding
it
to
her
breast
it
is
you
good
women
who
make
marriage
a
lottery
for
us
you
for
instance
because
you
drew
a
prize
yourself
you
see
no
reason
why
every
other
woman
should
not
be
equally
fortunate
i
think
when
people
make
sure
beforehand
that
they
love
each
other
they
are
safe
even
when
the
man
has
been
all
that
he
ought
to
have
been
love
is
a
great
purifier
and
love
for
a
good
woman
has
saved
many
a
man
beale
declared
with
the
fervour
of
full
conviction
that
is
presuming
that
a
man
has
not
been
all
that
he
ought
to
have
been
is
still
able
to
love
said
evadne
which
is
not
the
case
we
are
all
endowed
with
the
power
to
begin
with
but
love
is
a
delicate
essence
as
volatile
as
it
is
delicious
and
when
a
man
moral
fibre
is
loosened
his
share
of
love
escapes
but
this
is
not
the
point
she
broke
off
dropping
beale
hand
and
gathering
herself
together
the
trouble
now
is
that
you
are
going
to
let
edith
throw
herself
away
on
a
man
you
know
nothing
about
ah
my
dear
you
are
mistaken
beale
interrupted
comfortably
triumphant
they
have
known
each
other
all
their
lives
they
used
to
play
together
as
children
and
when
i
wrote
to
ask
her
consent
to
the
engagement
he
replied
that
the
one
thing
which
could
reconcile
him
to
parting
with
edith
was
her
choice
of
a
man
who
had
grown
up
under
our
own
eyes
i
can
assure
you
that
we
know
his
faults
quite
as
well
as
his
good
qualities
i
thought
you
would
like
to
have
me
in
the
regiment
evadne
edith
ventured
with
timid
reproach
i
would
not
like
to
have
you
anywhere
as
that
man
wife
evadne
answered
well
if
he
is
said
edith
with
a
flash
of
enthusiasm
if
he
is
i
will
make
him
good
if
he
is
lost
i
will
save
him
spoken
like
a
true
woman
dearest
her
mother
said
rising
to
kiss
her
and
then
standing
back
to
look
up
at
her
with
yearning
love
and
admiration
evadne
rose
also
with
a
heavy
sigh
i
know
how
you
feel
she
said
to
edith
drearily
you
glow
and
are
glad
from
morning
till
night
you
have
a
great
yearning
here
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
breast
you
find
a
new
delight
in
music
a
new
beauty
in
flowers
unaccountable
joy
in
the
warmth
and
brightness
of
the
sun
and
rapture
not
to
be
contained
in
the
quiet
moonlight
you
despise
yourself
and
think
your
lover
worthy
of
adoration
the
consciousness
of
him
never
leaves
you
even
in
your
sleep
he
is
your
last
thought
at
night
your
first
in
the
morning
even
when
he
is
away
from
you
you
do
not
feel
separated
from
him
as
you
do
from
other
people
for
a
sense
of
his
presence
remains
with
you
and
you
flatter
yourself
that
your
spirits
mingle
when
your
bodies
are
apart
you
think
too
that
the
source
of
all
this
ecstasy
is
holy
because
it
is
pleasurable
you
imagine
it
will
last
forever
edith
stared
at
her
that
evadne
should
know
the
entrancement
of
love
herself
so
exactly
and
not
reverence
it
as
holy
amazed
her
and
you
call
it
love
evadne
added
as
if
she
had
read
her
thought
but
it
is
not
love
the
threshold
of
love
and
hate
adjoin
and
it
this
feeling
stands
midway
between
them
an
introduction
to
either
it
is
always
a
question
as
marriages
are
now
made
whether
when
passion
has
had
time
to
cool
husband
and
wife
will
love
or
detest
each
other
but
what
is
the
use
of
talking
she
exclaimed
you
will
not
heed
me
it
is
too
late
now
she
turned
and
walked
toward
the
door
but
edith
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
stopped
her
evadne
do
not
go
like
this
she
entreated
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
wish
me
well
at
least
i
wish
you
well
said
evadne
with
what
other
motive
could
i
have
said
so
much
but
i
ask
again
what
is
the
use
your
parents
are
content
to
let
you
marry
a
man
of
whose
private
life
they
have
no
knowledge
whatever
beale
interrupted
her
this
is
not
quite
the
case
she
confessed
we
know
that
there
have
been
errors
but
all
that
is
over
now
and
it
would
be
wicked
of
us
not
to
believe
the
best
and
hope
for
the
best
a
young
man
in
his
position
has
great
temptations
and
if
he
succumbs
he
is
pardoned
because
of
his
position
oh
come
now
evadne
beale
remonstrated
you
can
not
think
that
such
a
consideration
affects
our
decision
his
position
and
property
are
very
nice
in
themselves
and
indeed
all
that
we
care
about
in
that
way
for
edith
but
we
were
not
thinking
about
either
when
we
gave
our
consent
it
is
the
dear
fellow
himself
that
we
want
i
can
make
him
all
that
he
ought
to
be
i
know
i
can
edith
exclaimed
fervently
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
up
with
bright
eyes
full
of
confidence
and
passion
evadne
said
not
another
word
but
kissed
them
both
and
left
the
house
mother
how
strange
evadne
is
edith
ejaculated
beale
shook
her
head
several
times
i
heard
that
she
had
some
trouble
at
the
outset
of
her
own
married
life
she
said
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
doubtless
it
accounts
for
her
manner
do
think
about
it
however
she
will
recover
her
as
she
grows
older
a
little
shock
upsets
a
girl
judgment
very
often
but
she
is
so
clever
and
conscientious
she
will
certainly
get
over
it
but
you
are
quite
agitated
yourself
dear
come
think
no
more
about
what
she
said
her
own
marriage
quite
disproves
all
her
arguments
for
colonel
colquhoun
was
notoriously
just
the
kind
of
man
she
would
have
us
believe
mosley
is
and
see
what
she
has
done
for
him
and
how
well
they
get
on
together
think
no
more
about
it
dear
child
but
come
out
with
me
the
air
will
tranquillize
us
both
on
her
way
home
evadne
overtook
john
he
was
walking
slowly
with
his
chin
on
his
chest
looking
down
and
his
whole
demeanour
was
expressive
of
deep
dejection
he
looked
up
with
a
start
when
evadne
overtook
him
and
their
eyes
met
you
have
heard
she
said
he
made
an
affirmative
gesture
i
never
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
she
went
on
i
thought
i
hoped
pardon
me
but
i
hoped
it
would
be
you
she
liked
you
so
much
i
know
she
did
but
not
enough
for
she
refused
me
he
answered
gently
but
doubtless
it
is
all
for
the
best
ways
are
not
our
ways
you
know
and
we
suffer
because
we
are
too
proud
to
resign
ourselves
to
manifestations
of
his
wisdom
which
are
beyond
our
comprehension
when
you
came
up
i
was
feeling
as
if
i
could
never
say
will
be
done
with
my
whole
heart
fervently
in
this
matter
but
since
you
spoke
to
me
i
think
i
can
evadne
took
his
arm
and
the
gentle
pressure
of
her
hand
upon
it
expressed
her
heartfelt
sympathy
eloquently
if
it
had
been
anyone
else
i
thought
at
first
but
doubtless
doubtless
it
is
all
for
the
best
he
added
and
then
he
raised
his
head
and
changed
the
subject
bravely
but
evadne
did
not
hear
what
he
was
saying
for
suddenly
she
found
herself
on
the
cliffs
at
home
and
it
was
a
scented
summer
morning
the
air
was
balmy
the
sun
was
shining
the
little
waves
rippled
up
over
the
sand
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
hung
on
the
yellow
gorse
but
that
joy
in
her
own
being
which
lent
a
charm
to
these
was
wanting
and
the
songs
seemed
tuneless
the
scent
oppressive
the
sea
all
sameness
the
land
a
waste
and
the
sun
itself
a
glaring
garish
baldness
of
light
that
accentuated
her
own
disconsolation
the
length
of
a
life
that
is
not
worth
living
and
the
size
of
a
world
which
contains
no
corner
of
comfort
in
all
its
pitiless
expanse
and
it
was
the
same
story
too
she
was
witnessing
the
same
mystery
of
love
rejected
the
same
worthiness
for
the
same
unworthiness
the
same
fine
discipline
of
resignation
which
made
the
pain
of
it
endurable
listening
to
the
same
old
pulpit
platitudes
even
which
have
such
force
of
soothing
when
reverently
expressed
she
and
edith
were
very
different
types
of
girlhood
and
it
seemed
a
strange
coincidence
that
their
opportunities
should
have
been
identical
nevertheless
but
not
singular
that
their
action
should
have
been
the
same
because
the
force
of
nature
which
controlled
them
is
a
matter
of
constitution
more
than
of
character
and
subject
only
to
a
training
which
neither
of
them
had
received
and
without
which
instead
of
ruling
they
are
ruled
erratically
evadne
had
quite
forgotten
by
this
time
all
her
first
fine
feelings
on
the
subject
of
a
celibate
priesthood
she
now
held
that
the
laws
of
nature
are
the
laws
of
god
and
marriage
is
a
law
of
nature
which
there
is
no
evidence
that
god
has
ever
rescinded
evadne
had
not
heard
what
john
was
saying
and
she
did
not
care
to
hear
she
knew
that
it
was
not
relevant
to
anything
which
either
of
them
had
in
their
minds
but
still
held
his
arm
and
looked
up
at
him
sympathetically
when
he
paused
for
a
reply
and
at
that
moment
colonel
colquhoun
accompanied
by
sir
mosley
menteith
turned
out
of
a
side
street
just
behind
them
and
followed
on
in
the
same
direction
when
menteith
saw
the
two
walking
so
familiarly
arm
in
arm
he
glanced
at
colonel
colquhoun
out
of
the
comers
of
his
eyes
to
see
how
he
took
it
but
colonel
colquhoun
face
remained
serenely
impassive
easy
he
said
we
wo
overtake
them
till
we
arrive
at
the
house
i
expect
he
is
seeing
her
home
and
as
colquhoun
is
only
at
her
best
it
would
be
a
shame
to
deprive
him
of
the
small
recompense
he
will
get
for
his
trouble
he
twisted
his
moustache
and
continued
to
look
at
the
pair
thoughtfully
when
he
had
spoken
and
menteith
glanced
at
him
again
to
see
if
he
might
not
perchance
be
concealing
some
secret
annoyance
under
an
affectation
of
easy
indifference
but
there
was
not
a
trace
of
anything
of
the
kind
apparent
there
is
no
doubt
that
women
cling
to
the
clergy
was
the
outcome
of
colonel
colquhoun
reflections
i
mean
metaphorically
speaking
of
course
he
hastened
to
add
with
a
laugh
perceiving
the
double
construction
that
might
be
put
on
the
remark
in
view
of
the
situation
now
there
is
only
one
fellow
on
the
island
that
evadne
cares
for
as
much
as
she
does
for
her
friend
there
i
think
she
likes
the
other
better
though
you
mean
yourself
of
course
said
menteith
no
i
do
mean
myself
of
course
colonel
colquhoun
answered
putting
myself
out
of
the
question
it
is
price
i
mean
that
old
chap
menteith
exclaimed
well
he
pretty
safe
i
should
say
and
i
should
never
be
jealous
of
a
parson
myself
women
always
treat
them
haut
en
i
believe
sir
that
colquhoun
is
perfectly
with
anyone
whom
she
may
choose
for
a
friend
colonel
colquhoun
said
with
an
emphasis
which
made
menteith
apologize
immediately
colonel
colquhoun
asked
evadne
that
evening
what
she
thought
of
the
projected
marriage
i
think
it
detestable
she
answered
well
i
think
it
a
pity
myself
he
said
she
such
a
nice
looking
girl
too
evadne
turned
to
him
with
a
flash
of
hope
ca
you
do
something
she
exclaimed
ca
you
prevent
it
absolutely
impossible
he
answered
and
i
beg
as
a
favour
to
myself
that
you
wo
try
i
have
done
my
best
already
she
said
then
you
have
made
your
friends
enemies
for
life
he
declared
a
girl
like
that
wo
give
up
a
man
she
loves
even
for
such
considerations
as
have
made
you
indifferent
to
my
happiness
and
welfare
evadne
perceived
the
contradiction
involved
in
commending
edith
for
doing
what
he
considered
it
a
pity
that
she
do
but
she
recognized
her
own
impotence
also
and
was
silent
it
was
the
system
the
horrid
system
that
was
to
blame
and
neither
he
nor
she
nor
any
of
them
colonel
colquhoun
ruminated
for
a
little
it
is
rather
curious
he
finally
observed
that
you
should
both
have
shied
at
the
parsons
seeing
how
very
particular
you
are
who
told
you
we
had
both
refused
a
clergyman
evadne
asked
everybody
in
malta
knows
that
john
proposed
to
miss
beale
he
answered
and
your
father
told
me
about
the
offer
you
had
he
remarked
at
the
time
that
girls
will
only
have
manly
men
and
that
therefore
we
soldiers
get
the
pick
of
them
evadne
was
silent
she
was
thinking
of
something
her
father
had
once
remarked
in
her
presence
on
the
same
subject
i
have
observed
he
had
said
in
his
pompous
way
that
the
clergy
carry
off
all
the
nicest
girls
you
will
see
some
of
the
finest
who
have
money
of
their
own
too
marry
quite
commonplace
parsons
but
the
reason
is
obvious
it
is
their
faith
in
the
superior
moral
probity
of
churchmen
which
weighs
with
them
the
scales
went
home
the
following
week
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
immediately
they
both
wrote
to
evadne
kindly
before
they
left
and
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
but
she
could
not
persuade
herself
to
see
them
again
nor
did
they

edith
was
married
in

at

and
of

the
twins
were
present
at
the
wedding
from
what
social
gathering
were
they
ever
excluded
if
they
chose
to
be
present
beale
had
not
thought
of
asking
them
at
all
but
angelica
intimated
in
her
royal
way
that
she
wished
to
be
a
bridesmaid
and
diavolo
must
be
a
page
and
lady
adeline
begged
beale
for
heaven
sake
to
arrange
it
so
lest
worse
should
come
of
it
but
the
twins
did
not
enjoy
the
occasion
at
all
for
the
truth
was
that
they
were
not
as
they
had
been
angelica
was
rapidly
outstripping
diavolo
as
was
inevitable
at
that
age
he
was
still
a
boy
but
she
was
verging
on
womanhood
and
already
had
thoughts
which
did
not
appeal
to
him
and
moods
which
he
could
not
comprehend
the
consequence
being
continual
quarrels
between
them
those
quarrels
in
which
people
are
hottest
and
bitterest
not
because
of
their
hate
but
because
of
their
love
for
each
other
there
is
such
agony
in
misunderstanding
and
blame
when
all
has
hitherto
been
comprehension
approval
and
sympathy
the
shadow
of
approaching
maturity
which
would
separate
them
inevitably
for
the
next
few
years
already
touched
angelica
perceptibly
and
although
to
the
onlookers
they
seemed
to
treat
each
other
as
usual
both
children
felt
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
their
discomfort
was
all
the
greater
because
neither
of
them
could
account
for
the
change
angelica
had
been
for
some
time
in
her
most
hoydenish
least
human
stage
during
which
she
had
given
up
hugging
diavolo
and
taken
to
butting
him
in
the
stomach
instead
but
she
was
growing
beyond
that
now
and
was
in
fact
just
on
the
borderland
hovering
between
two
states
in
the
one
of
which
she
was
a
child
all
nonsense
and
mischievous
tricks
and
in
the
other
a
girl
with
tender
impulses
and
yearning
senses
seeking
some
satisfaction
she
and
diavolo
had
promised
themselves
some
fun
at
edith
wedding
but
when
the
morning
came
angelica
was
moody
and
irritable
and
diavolo
watched
her
and
waited
in
vain
for
a
suggestion
when
they
were
in
the
cathedral
during
the
ceremony
she
had
a
strange
feeling
that
there
was
something
in
it
ail
that
specially
concerned
her
and
she
looked
at
edith
and
listened
to
the
service
intently
in
an
involuntary
effort
to
obtain
some
clue
to
her
own
sensations
diavolo
who
was
all
sympathy
when
there
was
anything
really
wrong
with
her
became
alarmed
does
your
stomach
ache
he
whispered
they
were
kneeling
side
by
side
no
she
answered
shortly
oh
then
i
suppose
there
is
something
wrong
he
observed
in
a
satisfied
tone
as
if
he
knew
from
experience
that
that
was
a
small
thing
compared
with
the
other
complaint
they
sat
together
at
the
wedding
breakfast
but
angelica
continued
silently
observant
diavolo
had
brought
a
big
boiled
shrimp
in
his
pocket
it
was
black
and
of
great
age
and
he
managed
to
fasten
it
adroitly
on
the
shoulder
of
the
lady
who
sat
next
him
so
that
its
long
antenna
tickled
her
neck
and
provoked
her
attention
to
it
glancing
down
sideways
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
black
eyes
and
many
legs
she
thought
it
was
some
horrid
creature
with
a
sting
and
jumped
up
shrieking
wildly
to
everybody
consternation
angelica
declared
it
was
a
stupid
trick
well
you
put
me
up
to
it
yourself
diavolo
grumbled
did
i
she
snapped
then
i
was
wrong
somebody
began
to
make
a
speech
which
was
all
in
praise
of
the
lovely
bride
and
diavolo
listening
to
it
and
remembering
that
he
had
wished
to
marry
her
himself
became
intensely
sentimental
he
recovered
his
shrimp
and
laying
it
out
on
the
cloth
before
him
gazed
at
it
in
a
melancholy
way
all
the
nice
girls
marry
he
complained
thinking
of
evadne
well
what
that
to
you
angelica
demanded
with
a
jealous
flash
only
that
i
suppose
you
also
will
marry
and
leave
me
some
day
he
readily
responded
diavolo
was
nothing
if
not
courtly
but
angelica
knew
him
and
resented
this
attempt
to
impose
upon
her
i
despise
you
she
exclaimed
and
then
she
turned
to
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
who
was
her
neighbour
on
the
right
and
made
great
friends
with
him
to
spite
diavolo
but
the
latter
was
engrossed
in
his
breakfast
by
that
time
and
took
no
notice
when
they
got
back
to
hamilton
house
ellis
asked
her
how
she
had
enjoyed
the
wedding
it
made
me
feel
she
said
and
then
she
got
a
book
and
flinging
herself
down
on
a
window
seat
with
her
long
legs
straggling
out
behind
her
and
her
face
to
the
light
made
a
pretence
of
reading
diavolo
hovered
about
her
with
a
dismal
face
trying
to
devise
some
method
of
taking
her
out
of
herself
my
ear
does
bother
me
he
said
at
last
sitting
down
beside
her
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
his
legs
stretched
straight
out
before
him
close
together
i
feel
as
if
i
could
tear
it
off
no
do
you
might
want
it
again
angelica
retorted
and
then
the
observation
striking
her
as
ludicrous
she
looked
up
at
him
and
grinned
and
so
broke
the
ice
ellis
was
the
first
to
notice
signs
of
the
impending
change
in
angelica
although
she
was
over
fifteen
she
had
no
coquettish
or
womanly
ways
insisted
on
wearing
her
dresses
up
to
her
knees
expressed
the
strongest
objection
to
being
and
considered
a
young
lady
and
had
never
been
known
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
but
she
began
to
be
less
teasing
and
more
sympathetic
and
sometimes
now
if
the
tutor
were
tired
or
worried
she
noticed
it
and
pulled
diavolo
up
for
being
a
nuisance
the
day
after
the
wedding
in
the
afternoon
galbraith
walked
over
from
fountain
towers
to
hamilton
house
through
the
fields
and
encountered
lord
dawne
in
the
porch
it
was
lovely
summer
weather
i
am
looking
for
the
children
lord
dawne
said
i
have
come
over
from
morne
with
a
message
for
them
from
their
grandfather
do
you
happen
to
have
seen
them
anywhere
yes
i
have
galbraith
answered
drily
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
discovered
them
just
now
in
a
field
of
mine
a
hayfield
not
that
they
were
making
any
pretence
of
hiding
themselves
however
he
hastened
to
add
for
they
were
each
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
separate
haycock
carrying
on
an
animated
discussion
in
tones
as
elevated
as
their
position
so
that
i
heard
them
long
before
i
saw
them
they
will
end
the
discussion
by
demolishing
my
haycocks
i
suppose
he
concluded
resignedly
what
was
it
all
about
lord
dawne
asked
well
i
believe
they
started
with
the
vexed
question
of
primogeniture
galbraith
replied
but
when
i
came
up
with
them
they
were
quarrelling
because
they
could
not
agree
as
to
whether
they
were
more
their
or
their
mother
children
angelica
maintained
the
latter
for
reasons
which
she
gave
at
the
top
of
her
voice
with
admirable
accuracy
when
i
appeared
they
both
appealed
to
me
to
confirm
their
opinions
but
i
fled
i
am
not
so
advanced
as
the
heavenly
twins
lord
dawne
looked
grave
what
will
become
of
the
child
angelica
he
said
oh
you
need
be
anxious
about
her
galbraith
replied
looking
full
at
him
with
sympathy
and
affection
in
his
kind
gray
eyes
she
has
no
vice
in
her
whatever
and
not
a
trace
of
hysteria
her
talk
is
mere
exuberance
of
intellect
i
do
know
her
uncle
answered
peut
tout
dire
arrive
ŕ
tout
you
know
i
find
that
falsified
continually
in
my
profession
galbraith
rejoined
it
depends
entirely
as
a
rule
upon
how
the
thing
is
said
and
why
if
it
be
a
matter
of
inclination
only
controlled
by
fear
of
the
law
or
public
opinion
which
is
expressed
the
aphorism
would
hold
probably
but
language
which
is
the
outcome
of
moods
or
phases
that
are
transient
makes
no
permanent
mark
upon
the
character
lord
dawne
took
galbraith
to
the
drawing
room
where
they
found
lady
adeline
with
and
the
tutor
ellis
had
been
a
great
comfort
to
lady
adeline
ever
since
he
came
to
the
house
she
felt
she
said
that
she
should
always
owe
him
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
for
his
patient
care
of
her
terrible
children
you
are
just
in
time
for
tea
george
she
said
to
galbraith
dawne
you
had
better
wait
here
for
the
children
they
wo
be
late
this
afternoon
i
am
sure
because
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
is
here
and
angelica
likes
him
to
talk
to
ah
now
you
do
surprise
me
said
galbraith
for
i
should
have
thought
that
kilroy
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
interest
angelica
and
so
he
is
observed
in
his
precisest
way
and
she
does
not
profess
to
find
him
interesting
but
what
she
says
is
that
she
must
talk
and
he
does
for
a
target
to
talk
at
lady
adeline
looked
anxiously
at
the
door
while
her
husband
was
speaking
she
was
in
terror
lest
kilroy
should
come
in
and
hear
him
for
had
a
habit
of
threshing
his
subject
out
even
when
it
was
obviously
unfortunate
and
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
interrupted
by
anybody
he
made
his
favourite
gesture
with
his
hands
when
he
had
spoken
which
consisted
in
spreading
his
long
white
fingers
out
as
if
he
wore
lace
ruffles
which
were
in
the
way
and
was
shaking
them
back
a
little
he
had
a
long
cadaverous
face
clean
shaven
straight
hair
of
suspicious
brownness
parted
in
the
middle
and
plastered
down
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
a
general
air
of
being
one
of
his
own
puritan
ancestors
who
should
have
appeared
in
black
velvet
and
lace
and
his
punctilious
manners
strengthened
this
impression
the
one
trinket
he
displayed
was
a
ring
which
he
wore
on
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
a
handsome
intaglio
carved
out
of
crimson
coral
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
part
of
his
natural
costume
which
had
survived
and
came
into
play
continually
kilroy
entered
the
room
in
time
to
hear
the
concluding
remark
but
naturally
did
not
take
it
to
himself
and
lord
dawne
seeing
his
trepidation
came
to
the
rescue
by
diverting
the
subject
into
another
channel
they
were
all
sitting
round
an
open
window
and
just
at
that
moment
the
twins
themselves
appeared
in
sight
straggling
up
the
drive
in
a
deep
discourse
with
their
arms
round
each
other
necks
and
angelica
dark
head
resting
against
diavolo
fair
one
harmony
reigns
among
the
heavenly
bodies
apparently
said
galbraith
the
powers
of
darkness
plotting
evil
more
likely
said
their
uncle
dawne
naughty
children
what
have
they
done
with
their
hats
lady
adeline
exclaimed
discovered
some
ingenious
method
of
doing
damage
to
my
hay
with
them
most
probably
galbraith
observed
they
all
leant
forward
watching
the
children
angelica
is
growing
up
said
lord
dawne
she
has
always
been
the
taller
stronger
and
wickeder
of
the
two
and
will
remain
so
i
expect
said
galbraith
but
how
old
is
she
now
exactly
kilroy
wished
to
know
nearly
sixteen
lady
adeline
answered
but
a
very
young
sixteen
in
some
ways
i
am
thankful
to
say
and
i
believe
we
have
you
to
thank
ellis
for
keeping
her
so
the
tutor
strong
but
careworn
face
flushed
sensitively
but
he
only
answered
with
a
deprecating
gesture
then
how
old
is
diavolo
kilroy
pursued
absently
about
the
same
age
replied
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
lady
adeline
looked
puzzled
of
course
they
are
the
same
age
she
said
as
if
the
point
could
be
disputed
kilroy
woke
up
oh
of
course
of
course
he
exclaimed
with
some
embarrassment
the
twins
had
gone
round
the
house
by
this
time
and
presently
diavolo
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
alone
his
thick
fair
hair
stood
out
round
his
head
like
a
rumpled
mop
his
face
and
hands
were
not
immaculate
and
his
clothes
were
creased
but
he
entered
the
room
with
the
same
courtly
yet
diffident
air
and
ease
which
distinguished
his
uncle
dawne
whom
he
imitated
as
well
as
resembled
in
most
things
he
took
his
seat
beside
him
now
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
nice
day
and
but
before
he
could
finish
the
affable
phrase
the
door
burst
open
from
without
and
angelica
entered
hollo
are
you
all
here
she
said
how
are
you
uncle
dawne
i
wish
you
would
not
be
so
impetuous
diavolo
remonstrated
gently
you
quite
startle
one
you
a
coon
said
angelica
my
dear
child
lady
angeline
began
well
mamma
no
matter
i
do
diavolo
grumps
at
me
angelica
snapped
what
expressions
you
use
sighed
lady
adeline
angelica
plumped
down
on
the
arm
of
her
uncle
chair
and
hugged
him
round
the
head
with
one
hand
she
smelt
overpoweringly
strong
of
hay
and
hot
weather
but
he
patiently
endured
the
caress
which
was
over
in
a
moment
as
it
happened
for
angelica
caught
sight
of
her
cat
lurking
under
a
sofa
opposite
and
bending
down
double
whistled
to
it
then
she
turned
her
attention
to
a
huge
slice
of
bread
butter
and
jam
she
held
in
her
hand
diavolo
soul
appeared
in
his
face
and
shone
out
of
his
eyes
when
she
bit
it
have
some
said
angelica
going
over
to
him
and
edging
him
half
off
his
chair
so
as
to
make
room
for
herself
beside
him
she
held
the
bread
and
butter
to
his
mouth
as
she
spoke
and
they
finished
it
together
bite
and
bite
about
now
i
am
ready
for
tea
said
angelica
when
they
had
done
so
am
i
said
diavolo
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
let
us
have
afternoon
tea
with
you
here
ellis
angelica
coaxed
it
so
much
more
sociable
and
i
want
to
talk
to
mr
kilroy
she
jumped
up
in
her
impetuous
way
plumped
down
again
on
a
low
stool
in
front
of
that
gentleman
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
looked
up
in
his
face
as
she
spoke
that
a
nice
place
you
got
at
she
was
beginning
but
ellis
interrupted
her
by
throwing
up
his
head
and
ejaculating
grammar
angelica
exclaimed
testily
now
you
put
me
all
out
oh
i
was
going
to
say
a
nice
place
at
ilverthorpe
we
were
over
there
the
other
day
and
inspected
it
very
happy
glad
i
am
sure
you
did
not
stand
upon
ceremony
kilroy
answered
but
this
politeness
seemed
altogether
superfluous
to
angelica
and
she
did
not
therefore
acknowledge
it
in
any
way
i
suppose
you
will
go
into
parliament
now
she
pursued
kilroy
looked
surprised
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
lately
but
he
was
not
aware
of
having
mentioned
it
to
anyone
i
hope
you
will
at
all
events
she
continued
and
let
me
write
your
speeches
for
you
that
is
what
diavolo
is
going
to
do
you
see
i
shall
want
a
mouthpiece
until
i
get
in
myself
and
i
do
mind
having
two
if
you
are
clever
at
learning
by
heart
you
a
pleasant
voice
and
good
address
to
begin
with
and
that
is
all
in
your
favour
oh
you
exchange
glances
with
papa
she
broke
off
he
does
know
how
i
mean
to
order
my
life
in
the
least
but
you
will
allow
him
some
voice
in
the
ordering
of
it
at
least
until
you
marry
i
suppose
kilroy
observed
that
depends
angelica
answered
decidedly
you
see
a
child
comes
into
the
world
for
purposes
of
its
own
and
not
in
order
to
carry
out
any
preconceived
ideas
its
father
may
have
of
what
it
is
good
for
and
as
to
marrying
well
that
requires
consideration
now
i
call
that
a
very
proper
spirit
in
which
to
approach
the
subject
kilroy
declared
you
have
every
right
to
expect
to
make
the
best
match
possible
and
the
choice
for
a
young
lady
in
your
position
will
be
restricted
not
at
all
said
angelica
bluntly
is
thy
servant
a
slave
of
a
princess
that
she
should
marry
a
rickety
king
i
have
quite
other
views
for
myself
in
fact
i
think
the
wisest
plan
for
me
would
be
to
buy
a
nice
clean
little
boy
and
bring
him
up
to
suit
my
own
ideas
i
need
marry
him
you
know
if
he
does
turn
out
well
she
slipped
from
the
footstool
on
to
the
floor
as
she
spoke
and
began
to
make
friendly
overtures
to
the
cat
i
always
thought
you
had
designs
on
dr
galbraith
said
diavolo
meaning
to
provoke
her
did
you
she
answered
then
you
must
have
thought
me
of
a
suicidal
tendency
why
he
would
pound
me
up
in
a
mortar
if
i
disagreed
with
him
you
have
heard
him
slam
a
door
he
irascible
diavolo
answered
quite
as
if
galbraith
were
not
present
listening
to
him
he
called
me
a
little
brute
on
one
occasion
which
reminds
me
said
galbraith
what
have
you
done
to
my
decoy
the
birds
have
forsaken
it
we
never
did
anything
to
your
decoy
rejoined
angelica
in
a
positive
tone
you
just
went
down
there
yourself
one
day
and
exploded
some
long
words
at
the
ducks
and
naturally
they
scooted
well
i
warn
you
said
galbraith
frowning
with
decision
i
warn
you
that
i
am
going
to
have
keys
made
for
everything
about
the
place
that
will
lock
up
and
all
the
same
i
shall
only
allow
you
to
come
under
escort
of
the
chief
constable
and
i
shall
keep
a
posse
of
detectives
concealed
about
the
grounds
to
watch
for
you
carefully
the
twins
exploded
with
delight
did
i
promise
you
i
draw
him
this
afternoon
diavolo
exclaimed
you
did
angelica
responded
with
tears
in
her
eyes
lord
dawne
got
up
wo
you
stay
for
tea
lady
adeline
exclaimed
it
is
just
coming
i
do
care
for
any
thank
you
he
answered
and
i
really
ought
not
to
have
stayed
so
long
i
only
came
to
ask
if
you
would
let
the
children
come
both
my
father
and
fulda
have
set
their
hearts
upon
having
them
are
we
to
go
to
morne
cried
angelica
for
a
visit
to
stay
said
diavolo
if
you
behave
yourselves
their
mother
answered
oh
in
that
case
said
diavolo
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
at
an
impossibility
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
be
good
there
said
angelica
grandpapa
would
be
so
dreadfully
disappointed
if
we
were
quite
so
said
diavolo
and
then
they
scampered
out
together
into
the
hall
and
kicked
each
other
in
the
exuberance
of
their
spirits
but
without
chapter
ii
as
soon
as
the
heavenly
twins
were
safely
settled
at
morne
played
them
a
huge
trick
he
made
lady
adeline
pack
up
and
set
off
with
him
for
a
voyage
round
the
world
without
them
when
their
parents
were
well
on
the
way
and
the
news
was
broken
to
the
children
the
people
at
morne
expected
storm
and
trouble
but
the
heavenly
twins
saw
the
joke
at
once
and
chuckled
immoderately
i
wonder
how
long
it
took
him
to
think
it
out
said
diavolo
it
must
have
been
a
brilliant
impromptu
angelica
supposed
because
you
know
our
coming
here
was
all
arranged
in
a
moment
if
you
remember
we
came
because
they
looked
so
sure
that
we
should
i
expect
as
soon
as
we
had
gone
it
was
such
a
relief
that
papa
said
my
dear
we
must
prolong
this
period
of
peace
and
he
just
about
hit
on
the
only
way
to
do
so
i
should
like
to
have
seen
him
though
popping
in
and
out
of
the
train
whenever
it
stopped
he
must
have
been
in
a
perfect
fever
until
they
were
safe
on
board
and
out
at
sea
fearing
we
might
have
heard
that
they
were
off
and
found
some
means
of
following
them
we
might
do
so
still
said
angelica
thoughtfully
no
too
much
bother
said
diavolo
and
besides
there
is
good
deal
going
on
here
you
know
he
added
significantly
but
i
say
he
demanded
becoming
suddenly
do
you
understand
how
they
could
go
off
like
that
without
saying
to
us
i
call
it
beastly
unnatural
oh
give
them
their
due
said
angelica
they
did
say
to
us
do
you
remember
how
particularly
affectionate
they
were
the
last
time
they
came
and
all
the
good
advice
they
gave
us
attend
to
ellis
worry
your
grandfather
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
must
have
relieved
their
own
feelings
thoroughly
well
then
they
did
consider
ours
much
diavolo
grumbled
and
they
might
have
allowed
us
poor
the
comfort
of
bidding
them
farewell
we
write
them
a
letter
said
angelica
diavolo
grinned
and
this
was
how
it
happened
that
the
heavenly
twins
who
had
only
gone
to
morne
for
a
month
remained
a
year
there
and
one
of
the
most
important
years
of
their
lives
as
was
afterward
evident
it
was
during
this
time
that
they
managed
to
identify
themselves
completely
with
their
grandfather
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
of
morningquest
charming
manners
were
a
family
trait
and
the
heavenly
twins
had
always
been
popular
in
the
city
on
their
own
account
their
spontaneity
and
extreme
affability
having
usually
been
held
to
balance
their
monkey
tricks
hamilton
house
however
was
ten
miles
distant
from
morningquest
and
they
had
hitherto
been
thought
of
as
but
after
that
year
at
the
castle
they
became
identified
with
the
old
stock
the
alien
being
dropped
out
of
sight
altogether
the
duke
himself
had
always
been
popular
he
had
like
his
ancestors
lived
much
in
his
castle
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
city
and
had
dominated
the
latter
by
his
personality
as
well
as
by
his
place
so
that
the
people
predisposed
by
the
pressure
of
hereditary
habit
to
recognize
the
of
one
of
his
family
and
being
no
longer
subject
to
the
authority
of
their
duke
as
in
the
old
days
when
he
was
a
ruler
who
must
be
obeyed
looked
up
to
him
involuntarily
as
an
example
to
be
followed
which
was
how
it
came
to
pass
that
for
the
last
half
century
there
had
been
two
influences
at
work
in
morningquest
that
of
the
chime
full
fraught
with
spiritual
suggestion
and
that
of
the
duke
which
was
just
the
opposite
they
were
the
influences
of
good
and
evil
and
needless
to
say
the
effect
of
the
latter
was
much
the
more
certain
of
the
two
a
great
change
however
came
over
the
duke
toward
the
end
of
his
life
in
his
youth
he
had
filled
the
place
with
riot
and
debauchery
in
middle
age
he
had
concealed
his
doings
under
respectable
cloaks
of
excuse
such
as
the
county
club
and
business
but
now
he
was
old
and
superstitious
and
sought
to
sway
the
people
in
another
direction
altogether
for
when
his
youngest
daughter
the
beautiful
lady
fulda
became
a
roman
catholic
she
wrought
upon
him
by
her
earnestness
so
as
to
make
him
fear
the
flames
and
drove
him
in
that
way
to
seek
solace
and
salvation
in
the
church
as
well
and
when
he
had
done
so
himself
he
rather
expected
and
quite
intended
that
everybody
else
should
do
likewise
but
the
people
of
morningquest
who
had
adopted
his
vices
did
not
fear
the
flames
themselves
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
piety
they
were
like
the
children
in
punch
who
when
threatened
with
the
policeman
at
the
corner
exclaimed
in
derision
why
that
father
and
besides
the
times
were
changing
rapidly
and
the
influence
which
remained
to
the
aristocracy
was
already
only
dominant
so
long
as
it
went
the
way
of
popular
feeling
and
was
human
directly
it
retrograded
to
past
privileges
ideas
superstitions
and
tastes
the
people
laughed
at
it
they
knew
that
the
threatened
rule
of
the
priest
was
a
anachronism
which
they
need
not
fear
for
themselves
in
the
aggregate
and
they
therefore
gave
themselves
up
with
interest
to
the
observation
of
such
evidences
of
its
effect
on
the
individual
as
the
duke
should
betray
to
them
from
time
to
time
their
theory
was
that
having
grown
too
old
for
worldly
dissipation
he
had
entered
the
church
in
search
of
new
forms
of
excitement
and
to
vary
the
monotony
generally
as
so
many
elderly
coquettes
do
when
they
can
no
longer
attract
attention
in
any
other
way
this
the
people
maintained
was
the
nature
of
such
religious
consolation
as
he
enjoyed
and
upon
that
supposition
certain
lapses
of
his
were
accounted
for
uncharitably
but
in
truth
the
duke
was
perfectly
sincere
he
had
turned
so
late
in
life
however
that
he
was
apt
by
force
of
habit
to
get
muddled
his
difficulty
was
to
disconnect
the
past
from
the
present
the
two
having
a
tendency
to
mix
themselves
up
in
his
mind
the
great
interest
of
his
old
age
was
the
building
of
a
roman
catholic
cathedral
in
morningquest
but
occasionally
and
always
at
the
most
inconvenient
times
he
would
forget
it
was
a
cathedral
and
imagine
it
was
an
opera
house
he
was
supporting
and
when
he
went
to
distribute
the
prizes
in
the
schools
he
would
compliment
the
pretty
girls
on
their
good
looks
instead
of
lecturing
them
on
the
sin
of
vanity
and
promise
that
they
should
sing
in
the
chorus
or
dance
in
the
ballet
if
their
legs
were
good
when
he
should
have
been
discoursing
about
the
dangers
of
the
vain
world
and
pointing
the
moral
of
happy
humble
obscurity
on
these
occasions
lady
fulda
who
was
always
beside
him
suffered
a
good
deal
she
would
pull
him
up
in
a
whisper
which
he
sometimes
made
her
repeat
until
everyone
in
the
place
had
heard
it
but
himself
and
then
at
last
when
he
did
understand
he
would
hasten
to
correct
himself
but
of
course
it
was
the
mistake
and
not
the
correction
which
made
the
most
lasting
impression
lady
fulda
was
not
at
all
clever
in
the
schoolroom
she
was
always
far
behind
her
sisters
lady
adeline
and
lady
claudia
and
before
his
conversion
her
father
used
to
say
that
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
juno
and
the
capacity
one
would
naturally
expect
from
the
portraits
of
that
matron
now
extant
but
this
was
not
fair
to
her
intelligence
for
she
had
a
certain
range
which
included
sympathetic
insight
and
the
knack
of
saying
the
right
thing
both
for
her
own
purpose
and
for
the
occasion
she
had
a
full
exterior
of
uncrumpled
lineless
delicately
tinted
flesh
a
voice
that
made
impressive
when
she
said
it
a
sincerity
which
paused
upon
every
expression
of
opinion
to
weigh
its
worth
she
would
hardly
say
it
is
a
fine
day
without
first
glancing
at
the
weather
just
to
be
sure
that
it
had
not
changed
since
she
decided
to
make
the
remark
and
she
had
a
great
loving
heart
if
she
did
not
sigh
for
husband
and
children
it
was
because
she
was
never
in
the
presence
of
any
creature
for
many
minutes
without
feeling
a
flood
of
tenderness
for
them
suffuse
her
whole
being
so
that
her
affections
were
always
satisfied
because
of
her
grand
presence
people
expected
great
things
of
her
and
none
of
them
ever
went
disappointed
away
she
filled
their
hearts
and
nobody
ever
complains
of
the
head
when
the
heart
is
full
love
was
the
secret
both
of
her
beauty
and
her
power
the
twins
arrived
late
one
day
at
morne
and
immediately
afterward
the
whole
castle
was
pervaded
by
their
presence
and
signs
of
them
appeared
in
the
most
unlikely
places
a
mysterious
packet
rolled
up
in
a
sheet
of
the
considerably
soiled
and
known
as
angelica
work
which
nobody
had
ever
seen
opened
was
found
in
the
oriel
room
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
sacred
to
the
duke
himself
and
a
cricket
cap
of
diavolo
was
discovered
on
one
of
the
tall
candles
which
stood
on
the
altar
in
the
private
chapel
of
the
castle
as
if
it
had
been
used
as
an
extinguisher
a
peculiar
intentness
was
also
observed
in
the
expression
of
the
countenances
which
was
thought
to
betoken
mischief
because
always
hitherto
it
had
been
noticed
that
when
the
gravity
of
their
demeanour
was
most
exemplary
the
wickedness
of
the
design
upon
which
they
were
engaged
was
sure
to
be
extreme
but
all
the
old
symptoms
were
misleading
at
this
time
for
the
twins
settled
down
at
once
with
lively
intelligent
interest
to
the
innocent
occupation
of
studying
the
ways
of
the
household
their
own
conduct
being
distinguished
for
the
most
part
by
a
masterly
inactivity
for
the
truth
was
they
were
thinking
they
had
lately
taken
to
reading
the
books
and
papers
and
magazines
of
the
day
which
they
found
in
the
library
at
hamilton
house
and
at
morne
they
followed
the
same
occupation
and
thus
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
questions
which
interested
them
treated
from
different
points
of
view
at
home
all
had
been
liberal
protestant
and
progressive
but
at
morne
the
tendency
of
everything
was
roman
catholic
conservative
and
retrograde
and
they
were
doing
their
best
as
their
conversations
with
different
people
at
this
time
showed
to
discover
the
why
and
wherefore
and
right
and
wrong
of
the
difference
angelica
was
naturally
the
first
to
draw
definite
conclusions
for
herself
and
having
made
up
her
own
mind
she
began
to
instruct
diavolo
she
was
teaching
him
to
respect
women
for
one
thing
when
he
did
respect
them
she
beat
him
and
this
made
him
thoughtful
you
would
strike
me
if
you
did
know
that
i
ca
strike
you
back
because
you
a
girl
he
remonstrated
and
you
would
say
that
if
you
did
know
that
the
cruellest
thing
you
can
do
to
a
woman
is
to
hurt
her
feelings
she
retorted
oh
feelings
exclaimed
diavolo
you
got
castanets
that
clack
where
you
should
have
feelings
angelica
raised
her
hand
and
then
dropped
it
by
her
side
again
and
looked
at
him
what
do
you
mean
by
this
nonsense
she
demanded
we
always
fought
everything
out
ever
since
we
were
born
yes
he
said
regretfully
and
you
used
to
be
as
hard
as
nails
when
i
got
a
good
hit
at
you
it
made
my
knuckles
tingle
but
now
you
getting
all
boggy
everywhere
just
look
at
your
arms
angelica
ripped
her
tight
sleeve
open
to
the
shoulder
with
one
of
her
sudden
jerks
and
looked
at
her
arm
now
see
mine
said
diavolo
taking
off
his
coat
and
turning
his
shirt
sleeve
up
in
his
more
deliberate
way
angelica
held
out
her
arm
beside
his
to
compare
them
hers
was
round
and
white
and
firm
with
every
little
blue
vein
visible
beneath
the
fine
transparent
skin
his
was
all
hard
muscle
and
bone
burnt
brown
with
the
sun
and
coarse
of
texture
compared
with
hers
you
see
now
he
said
angelica
slowly
drew
down
the
tattered
remains
of
her
sleeve
and
then
she
looked
at
diavolo
thoughtfully
and
from
him
to
a
reflection
of
herself
in
a
long
mirror
on
the
wall
we
growing
up
she
said
in
a
surprised
sort
of
tone
are
he
said
seem
to
be
just
about
as
young
as
ever
i
was
all
the
more
reason
that
i
should
teach
you
then
said
angelica
education
matures
the
mind
and
the
principal
instrument
of
education
for
your
sex
has
always
been
a
stick
women
are
open
to
reason
from
their
cradles
but
men
have
to
be
whopped
they
are
thrashed
at
school
that
being
as
they
have
always
maintained
themselves
the
best
way
to
deal
with
them
that
spareth
the
rod
hateth
his
son
but
he
that
loveth
him
chasteneth
him
betimes
and
not
correction
from
the
child
for
if
thou
beatest
him
with
the
rod
he
shall
not
die
it
is
only
the
boys
you
see
that
have
their
minds
enlarged
in
that
way
because
if
you
tell
a
girl
a
thing
she
understands
it
at
once
and
when
men
grow
up
and
things
go
wrong
they
still
think
they
ought
to
thrash
each
other
that
is
also
their
primitive
way
of
settling
the
disputes
of
nations
they
just
hack
each
other
down
in
hundreds
sacrificing
the
lives
which
are
precious
to
the
women
they
should
be
loving
for
the
sake
of
ideas
that
are
always
changing
you
certainly
the
stupid
part
of
humanity
she
concluded
and
how
you
ever
discovered
the
way
to
manage
each
other
i
ca
imagine
but
it
was
the
right
one
whip
for
the
horse
a
bridle
for
the
ass
and
a
rod
for
the
fool
back
and
so
saying
she
flounced
out
of
the
room
without
however
administering
the
parting
slap
of
another
kind
which
he
expected
but
the
episode
made
a
lasting
impression
on
diavolo
as
was
apparent
in
much
that
he
said
and
particularly
in
some
remarks
which
he
made
during
a
conversation
he
had
with
his
grandfather
toward
the
end
of
the
year
a
capital
understanding
had
always
existed
between
diavolo
and
his
grandfather
a
fact
which
caused
lady
adeline
heart
to
sink
every
time
she
observed
it
but
had
an
opposite
effect
on
the
duke
himself
a
quite
exhilarating
effect
indeed
which
was
the
cause
of
certain
of
those
lapses
which
lady
fulda
had
so
often
to
deplore
as
when
for
instance
he
aided
and
abetted
diavolo
in
some
of
his
worst
tricks
and
then
had
to
sit
sheepishly
by
saying
nothing
when
the
boy
was
found
out
and
corrected
lady
fulda
was
puzzled
by
the
intelligent
glances
that
passed
between
the
two
at
such
times
but
diavolo
was
perfectly
loyal
and
never
once
got
his
grandfather
into
trouble
one
of
the
dreams
of
the
old
duke
life
was
to
make
a
good
catholic
of
diavolo
and
to
that
end
his
conversation
was
often
directed
intermittently
it
is
true
because
diavolo
was
skilled
in
the
art
of
beguiling
him
into
other
subjects
when
it
suited
himself
the
duke
was
turning
his
attention
at
this
time
under
lady
direction
to
the
spiritual
welfare
of
that
class
of
women
which
in
former
times
he
had
been
accustomed
to
countenance
in
quite
another
way
lady
fulda
had
established
a
refuge
for
these
in
morningquest
and
her
father
was
deeply
interested
in
the
success
of
the
undertaking
the
heavenly
twins
were
also
much
interested
at
first
they
could
not
make
out
why
their
aunt
fulda
so
often
breakfasted
in
her
outdoor
dress
and
whether
she
had
just
come
in
or
was
just
going
out
if
there
were
no
visitors
staying
at
the
castle
the
party
at
breakfast
was
small
there
being
only
the
old
duke
father
ricardo
ellis
and
the
heavenly
twins
as
a
rule
when
lady
fulda
did
appear
the
meal
was
usually
half
over
the
duke
sat
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
with
the
twins
on
either
side
of
him
but
he
was
generally
limp
and
querulous
in
the
morning
and
more
kindly
disposed
toward
father
ricardo
than
to
his
own
flesh
and
blood
as
angelica
pointed
out
on
one
occasion
when
lady
fulda
came
in
she
always
went
up
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
he
did
not
rise
to
receive
the
salute
but
he
invariably
held
her
hand
some
seconds
and
asked
any
news
anxiously
to
which
she
always
answered
yes
or
no
and
then
he
would
say
you
must
tell
me
afterward
go
to
your
seat
now
take
plenty
of
rest
and
refreshment
both
are
necessary
both
are
necessary
the
heavenly
twins
were
inclined
to
regard
this
scene
with
the
scorn
and
contempt
of
ignorance
at
first
but
when
lord
dawne
came
to
the
castle
for
a
few
days
with
their
widowed
aunt
lady
claudia
and
ideala
and
all
these
paid
the
same
reverent
attention
to
lady
fulda
report
as
the
duke
and
father
ricardo
did
they
reserved
judgment
until
they
should
know
more
about
the
matter
they
asked
ellis
for
an
explanation
but
he
told
them
bluntly
to
mind
their
own
business
and
further
puzzled
them
by
a
remark
which
they
chanced
to
hear
him
make
about
lady
fulda
to
galbraith
they
did
not
overhear
what
galbraith
had
said
to
lead
up
to
it
but
ellis
answered
grasp
her
character
she
is
not
a
character
at
all
she
a
beautiful
abstraction
now
ideala
is
human
although
the
twins
were
protestants
by
education
and
also
by
nature
one
may
say
it
had
pleased
them
to
go
regularly
to
certain
services
in
the
chapel
from
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
the
castle
we
enjoy
them
very
much
angelica
said
to
the
great
delight
of
her
aunt
and
grandfather
i
am
sure
the
atmosphere
of
devotion
in
which
we
live
will
have
its
effect
upon
the
children
the
latter
said
several
times
and
so
it
had
it
was
never
the
low
mass
however
at
which
they
appeared
but
the
more
sensuous
sumptuous
functions
when
there
was
music
of
which
they
both
were
exceedingly
fond
both
of
them
being
excellent
musicians
soon
after
her
arrival
at
the
castle
angelica
bought
a
big
drum
she
said
she
could
express
her
feelings
on
any
other
instrument
on
sunday
her
spiritual
fervour
was
so
excessive
her
behaviour
in
chapel
however
was
for
the
most
part
exemplary
her
aunt
noticed
that
she
often
knelt
all
through
the
service
with
a
book
before
her
thoroughly
absorbed
lady
fulda
was
anxious
to
know
what
the
book
was
and
on
one
occasion
when
angelica
remained
on
her
knees
after
the
congregation
had
dispersed
with
her
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
face
apparently
deeply
moved
her
aunt
stole
up
behind
her
softly
and
peeped
over
her
shoulder
expecting
to
see
a
holy
imitation
or
something
of
that
kind
but
to
her
horror
she
found
that
the
book
was
burnand
happy
thoughts
and
that
gurglings
were
not
tears
of
repentance
but
suppressed
explosions
of
hearty
laughter
this
happened
during
what
proved
to
be
rather
a
trying
time
for
lady
fulda
it
was
while
lord
dawne
lady
claudia
and
ideala
were
at
the
castle
and
the
old
duke
was
as
lady
fulda
delicately
phrased
it
to
her
sister
claudia
in
private
inclined
to
be
tiresome
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
had
several
relapses
one
of
these
happened
in
chapel
during
benediction
the
choir
had
been
singing
salutaris
hostia
at
the
conclusion
of
which
everybody
was
startled
by
a
senile
cheer
from
the
stalls
the
duke
had
dosed
off
into
a
dream
of
the
opera
and
had
awakened
suddenly
under
the
impression
that
a
wooden
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
opposite
had
just
completed
a
lovely
solo
and
was
unexpectedly
following
it
up
by
an
audacious
are
our
ancestors
like
us
diavolo
whispered
to
angelica
enthusiastically
but
angelica
dampened
his
ardent
admiration
of
the
by
refusing
to
believe
that
the
diminutive
duke
had
done
it
on
purpose
chapter
iii
the
next
day
diavolo
happened
to
stroll
into
the
oriel
room
about
and
finding
his
grandfather
sitting
there
alone
looking
down
upon
morningquest
from
his
accustomed
seat
in
the
great
deep
window
which
was
open
he
carefully
chose
a
soft
cushion
placing
it
on
the
low
sill
so
that
he
could
rest
his
back
against
it
and
stretching
himself
out
on
the
floor
looked
up
at
the
old
gentleman
sociably
you
growing
a
big
fellow
sir
the
latter
observed
but
not
growing
so
fast
as
angelica
is
said
diavolo
ah
women
mature
earlier
said
the
duke
but
their
minds
never
get
far
beyond
the
first
point
at
which
they
arrive
i
suppose
you
mean
when
they
marry
at
seventeen
or
their
education
is
otherwise
stopped
short
for
them
just
when
a
man
is
beginning
his
properly
diavolo
languidly
suggested
the
duke
frowned
down
at
him
where
is
your
sister
he
asked
that
i
ca
tell
you
diavolo
answered
do
you
know
the
duke
said
sharply
yes
was
the
cool
rejoinder
but
i
do
happen
to
have
my
permission
to
say
the
old
man
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
that
right
my
boy
right
he
said
loyalty
is
a
grand
virtue
be
loyal
to
the
ladies
he
shook
his
head
in
search
of
an
improving
aphorism
but
only
succeeded
in
extracting
a
familiar
saw
kiss
but
never
tell
he
said
it
vulgarly
put
my
boy
but
there
a
whole
code
in
it
and
a
damned
chivalrous
code
too
i
tell
you
men
were
gentlemen
when
they
stuck
to
it
there
was
a
sound
of
stealthy
footsteps
in
the
room
at
this
moment
and
the
old
duke
glanced
over
his
shoulder
apprehensively
while
diavolo
bent
to
one
side
to
peer
round
the
chair
his
grandfather
was
sitting
in
which
was
between
him
and
the
door
it
one
of
the
dogs
he
said
carelessly
father
ricardo
is
out
i
think
the
duke
looked
relieved
well
diavolo
resumed
reflectively
i
should
have
thought
myself
that
it
was
playing
it
pretty
low
down
to
sneak
on
a
woman
but
i
say
sir
he
asked
innocently
how
would
you
define
a
said
the
little
old
gentleman
taking
hold
of
his
collar
to
perk
himself
up
out
of
his
clothes
as
it
were
on
the
strength
of
his
past
reputation
a
is
a
eh
a
fellow
whom
ladies
eh
admire
do
you
mean
real
ladies
or
only
pretty
women
said
diavolo
both
my
boy
both
the
duke
answered
complacently
he
was
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
you
were
one
once
were
you
not
sir
said
diavolo
i
suppose
you
had
a
deuced
good
time
ah
the
duke
ejaculated
with
a
sigh
of
retrospective
satisfaction
then
suddenly
remembering
his
new
role
he
pulled
himself
up
and
added
severely
but
keep
clear
of
women
my
boy
keep
clear
of
women
women
are
the
very
devil
sir
but
supposing
they
run
after
said
diavolo
nowadays
you
know
a
fellow
gets
so
hunted
down
they
say
oh
ah
then
in
that
case
you
see
said
the
duke
relapsing
the
principle
has
always
been
to
take
the
goods
the
gods
may
send
you
and
be
thankful
there
was
a
pause
after
this
during
which
the
duke
again
recollected
himself
we
were
talking
about
women
he
sternly
recommenced
and
i
was
warning
you
that
their
wiles
are
snares
of
the
evil
one
who
finds
them
ever
ready
to
carry
out
his
worst
behests
women
are
bad
are
they
now
said
diavolo
well
i
should
have
thought
taking
them
all
round
you
know
that
they
a
precious
sight
better
than
are
it
was
a
woman
my
boy
the
duke
said
solemnly
who
compassed
the
fall
of
man
well
diavolo
rejoined
with
a
calmly
judicial
air
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
that
story
myself
and
it
does
seem
to
me
to
prove
that
women
are
weak
but
rather
the
contrary
for
you
see
the
woman
could
tempt
the
man
easily
enough
but
it
took
the
very
old
devil
himself
to
tempt
the
woman
humph
said
the
duke
looking
hard
at
his
grandson
and
at
any
rate
diavolo
pursued
it
happened
a
good
while
ago
that
business
and
it
just
as
likely
as
not
that
it
was
adam
whom
the
devil
first
put
up
to
a
thing
or
two
and
eve
got
it
out
of
him
for
i
grant
you
that
women
are
curious
and
then
they
both
came
a
cropper
together
and
it
was
a
case
of
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
it
mostly
is
i
should
think
in
a
business
of
that
kind
well
yes
said
the
duke
in
my
own
experience
i
always
found
that
we
were
just
about
one
as
bad
as
the
other
and
he
chuckled
then
we
may
conclude
that
there
is
a
doubt
about
that
garden
of
eden
story
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
and
it
too
old
for
an
argument
at
any
rate
said
diavolo
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
redemption
it
was
a
woman
who
managed
that
little
affair
and
altogether
it
seems
to
me
in
spite
of
the
disadvantage
of
being
classed
by
law
with
children
lunatics
beggars
and
irresponsible
people
generally
that
in
the
matter
of
who
have
done
most
good
in
the
world
women
come
out
a
long
chalk
ahead
of
us
why
the
devil
do
you
speak
english
sir
the
duke
burst
out
testily
diavolo
started
good
gracious
grandpapa
he
began
with
his
customary
deliberation
how
sudden
you
are
you
quite
made
me
jump
is
it
the
slang
you
do
like
yes
sir
it
the
slang
i
do
like
then
you
only
got
to
say
so
said
diavolo
in
a
tone
of
mild
remonstrance
you
really
quite
upset
me
when
you
so
sudden
angelica
will
tell
you
i
never
could
stand
being
startled
she
tried
all
kinds
of
things
to
cure
me
you
ca
frighten
me
you
know
it
just
the
jump
i
object
to
oh
you
object
do
you
said
the
duke
bending
his
brows
upon
him
then
i
apologise
oh
no
pray
do
mention
it
sir
said
diavolo
i
did
mean
you
to
go
so
far
as
that
you
know
and
it
over
in
a
minute
angelica
burst
into
the
room
at
this
point
followed
by
two
or
three
dogs
and
immediately
took
up
her
favourite
position
on
the
arm
of
her
grandfather
chair
i
want
some
tea
she
said
it
coming
said
diavolo
you
say
that
because
you
do
want
the
trouble
of
getting
up
to
ring
angelica
retorted
diavolo
looked
at
her
provokingly
and
she
was
about
to
say
something
tart
when
a
footman
opened
the
door
wide
and
two
others
entered
carrying
the
and
at
the
same
time
the
rest
of
the
party
began
to
assemble
lady
fulda
was
the
first
to
arrive
with
her
widowed
sister
lady
claudia
they
presented
a
great
contrast
the
one
being
so
perfectly
lovely
the
other
so
decidedly
plain
lady
claudia
was
a
tall
gaunt
woman
hard
in
manner
with
no
pretension
to
any
accomplishments
but
wise
and
of
a
faithful
affectionate
disposition
which
deeply
endeared
her
to
her
friends
lord
dawne
came
in
next
with
galbraith
and
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
and
these
were
followed
by
father
ricardo
and
ellis
after
whom
came
ideala
herself
alone
this
was
before
she
made
her
name
but
already
people
spoke
of
her
and
theoretically
men
were
supposed
not
to
like
her
because
of
her
ideas
do
you
know
which
were
strongly
opposed
in
some
circles
especially
by
those
who
either
did
not
know
or
could
not
understand
them
there
is
no
doubt
that
mankind
have
a
rooted
objection
to
be
judged
when
the
judge
is
a
woman
if
they
can
not
in
common
honesty
deny
the
wisdom
of
her
decisions
they
attack
her
for
venturing
to
decide
at
all
now
said
angelica
skipping
over
to
a
couch
beside
which
kilroy
was
sitting
we
shall
have
a
little
interesting
conversation
i
hope
you
will
kindly
allow
us
to
have
a
little
interesting
tea
first
said
diavolo
who
had
risen
politely
when
the
other
ladies
entered
the
room
a
formality
which
he
omitted
in
angelica
case
because
he
insisted
that
she
was
a
lady
when
the
tea
was
handed
round
and
the
servants
had
withdrawn
he
lounged
over
to
the
couch
where
she
was
in
his
deliberate
way
sat
down
beside
her
and
put
his
tea
cup
on
the
floor
and
then
they
put
their
arms
round
each
other
slanted
their
heads
together
and
sat
expectant
this
had
been
a
favourite
position
of
theirs
from
the
time
they
could
sit
up
at
all
and
when
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gossip
going
on
about
them
it
had
always
been
a
treat
to
see
them
sitting
so
with
blank
countenances
and
ears
open
collecting
capital
doubtless
for
new
outrages
on
public
decency
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
angelica
ideala
asked
smiling
oh
a
lot
of
things
angelica
exclaimed
straightening
herself
energetically
and
giving
diavolo
head
a
knock
with
her
own
to
make
him
move
it
out
of
the
way
i
been
reading
you
know
and
i
want
you
to
explain
i
want
to
know
how
people
can
be
so
silly
in
what
way
ideala
asked
well
i
thinking
of
aunt
fulda
said
the
candid
angelica
you
know
she
very
much
wants
to
make
a
roman
catholic
of
me
and
she
gave
me
some
books
to
read
and
of
course
i
read
them
they
were
all
about
the
church
being
the
true
church
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
i
got
a
lot
of
books
about
other
churches
and
each
said
that
was
the
true
church
just
as
positively
and
aunt
fulda
told
me
that
anyone
who
would
read
about
church
be
convinced
that
it
is
the
true
church
but
the
difficulty
is
to
get
people
to
read
so
when
i
found
these
other
books
i
took
them
to
her
to
show
her
all
about
the
other
true
churches
and
i
told
her
she
ought
to
read
them
because
if
there
were
truth
in
any
of
them
we
could
none
of
us
possibly
be
saved
unless
we
belonged
to
the
different
churches
but
do
you
know
she
would
look
at
a
book
she
said
she
was
allowed
to
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
after
telling
me
what
a
mistake
it
was
not
to
read
lady
fulda
and
her
father
were
talking
together
in
the
window
and
did
not
therefore
overhear
these
remarks
but
father
ricardo
was
listening
and
ideala
flashed
a
mischievous
glance
at
him
as
angelica
spoke
then
the
latter
continued
before
anyone
could
answer
her
aunt
fulda
is
just
as
good
as
she
possibly
be
and
father
ricardo
says
it
is
because
she
has
submitted
to
holy
church
and
orton
beg
and
mamma
are
also
as
good
as
they
possibly
can
be
and
the
bishop
of
morningquest
says
that
orton
beg
is
a
holy
woman
because
she
is
a
humble
follower
of
christ
but
he
rather
shakes
his
head
about
mamma
uncle
dawne
however
and
galbraith
both
maintain
that
mamma
is
admirable
because
she
does
trouble
her
head
about
churches
and
creeds
any
longer
she
used
to
do
so
once
but
now
she
thinks
only
of
what
is
right
or
wrong
and
leaves
the
ecclesiastical
muddle
for
the
divines
to
get
out
of
as
best
they
can
mamma
used
to
dread
bringing
us
to
morne
when
we
were
younger
we
were
always
so
outrageous
here
and
we
told
her
it
was
aunt
fulda
who
made
us
so
because
she
is
too
good
and
the
balance
of
nature
has
to
be
preserved
but
now
i
am
sure
aunt
claudia
is
quite
as
good
as
she
is
and
so
are
you
and
mamma
and
orton
beg
ideala
smiled
at
her
and
so
you
are
puzzled
she
said
well
now
i
will
explain
your
aunts
and
mother
and
orton
beg
are
all
of
those
people
born
good
who
would
have
been
saints
in
any
calendar
buddhist
christian
or
jewish
they
come
occasionally
these
good
people
to
cause
confusion
on
the
subject
of
original
sin
and
overthrow
the
pride
of
professors
who
maintain
that
their
own
code
of
religious
ethics
must
be
the
right
one
because
it
produces
the
best
specimens
of
humanity
there
was
a
chinese
lady
living
at
shanghai
a
few
years
ago
a
devout
buddhist
who
in
her
habits
of
life
her
character
her
prayers
her
penances
and
her
sweetness
of
disposition
exactly
resembled
your
aunt
fulda
the
only
difference
between
them
being
the
names
of
the
ideal
of
goodness
upon
whom
they
called
for
help
their
virtues
were
identical
and
the
moral
outcome
of
their
lives
was
the
same
i
see
what
you
mean
angelica
burst
out
and
you
would
say
either
or
yourself
would
you
well
no
ideala
acknowledged
i
always
adopt
a
little
pleonasm
myself
to
avoid
christian
controversy
and
say
became
a
roman
or
anglican
catholic
a
protestant
positivist
or
whatever
else
it
might
be
and
i
let
them
say
or
whichever
they
like
to
me
because
i
know
that
it
really
can
not
matter
so
long
as
they
are
agreeable
not
that
anybody
ever
expects
them
to
be
poor
little
people
although
they
know
quite
well
that
they
should
never
let
their
angry
passions
rise
they
have
no
sense
of
humour
at
all
but
just
fancy
how
silly
it
must
seem
to
the
angels
when
miss
protestant
throws
down
a
book
she
is
reading
and
shrieks
indeed
while
miss
catholic
at
the
same
moment
groans
indignantly
must
be
rotten
in
the
state
of
denmark
surely
or
one
or
other
of
them
would
have
proved
their
point
by
this
time
or
do
you
suppose
she
added
looking
at
lord
dawne
that
the
opposition
is
mercifully
preordained
by
nature
to
generate
the
right
amount
of
heat
by
friction
to
keep
things
going
so
that
we
do
not
come
to
a
standstill
on
the
way
to
human
perfection
it
is
very
wonderful
any
way
she
added
to
the
looker
on
wonderfully
funny
i
did
not
know
that
lady
adeline
had
definitely
left
the
church
of
england
kilroy
observed
and
i
am
surprised
to
hear
it
are
you
said
ideala
now
we
were
not
adeline
has
always
been
of
a
deeply
religious
disposition
but
it
was
not
bound
to
be
and
it
was
never
likely
to
be
the
religion
of
any
church
which
would
secure
her
lasting
reverence
i
wonder
what
the
religion
of
the
future
will
be
kilroy
remarked
it
will
consist
in
the
deepest
reverence
for
moral
worth
the
tenderest
pity
for
the
frailties
of
human
nature
the
most
profound
faith
in
its
ultimate
perfectibility
ideala
answered
the
religion
of
the
future
must
be
a
thing
about
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
consequently
no
dispute
it
will
be
for
the
peace
and
perfecting
of
man
not
for
the
exercise
of
his
power
to
outwit
an
antagonist
in
an
argument
and
there
are
only
the
great
moral
truths
perceived
since
the
beginning
of
thought
but
hard
to
hold
as
principles
of
action
because
the
higher
faculties
to
which
they
appeal
are
of
slower
growth
than
the
lower
ones
which
they
should
control
and
the
delights
they
offer
are
of
a
nature
too
delicate
to
be
appreciated
by
uncultured
palates
but
it
is
in
these
the
infinite
truths
known
to
buddha
reflected
by
plato
preached
by
christ
undoubted
undisputed
even
by
the
spirit
of
evil
that
religion
must
consist
and
is
steadily
growing
to
consist
while
the
questionable
gauds
of
sensuous
service
are
gradually
being
set
aside
the
religion
of
the
future
will
neither
be
a
political
institution
nor
a
means
of
livelihood
but
an
expression
of
the
highest
moral
attribute
human
or
divine
disinterested
love
she
sat
for
some
time
looking
down
at
the
floor
and
lost
in
thought
when
she
had
said
this
and
then
rousing
herself
she
turned
to
father
ricardo
i
had
a
fit
of
roman
catholicism
once
myself
she
said
to
him
pleasantly
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
while
it
lasted
but
you
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
you
clergy
in
the
first
place
you
begin
by
setting
up
christ
as
an
ideal
of
perfect
manhood
and
then
you
proceed
to
demolish
him
as
a
possible
example
by
maintaining
that
he
was
not
a
man
but
a
god
and
therefore
a
being
whom
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
imitate
oh
you
terrible
terrible
clergy
you
preach
the
parable
of
the
buried
talents
and
side
by
side
with
that
you
have
always
insisted
that
women
should
put
theirs
away
and
you
have
soothed
their
sensitive
consciences
with
the
dreadful
cant
of
obedience
not
obedience
to
the
moral
law
but
obedience
to
the
will
of
man
for
what
moral
law
could
be
affected
by
the
higher
education
of
women
the
anglican
church
is
rather
countenancing
the
higher
education
of
women
is
it
not
said
kilroy
you
do
put
it
properly
ideala
answered
women
after
a
hard
battle
secured
for
themselves
their
own
higher
education
and
now
that
it
is
being
found
to
answer
the
churches
are
coming
in
to
claim
the
credit
dear
how
rapidly
reforms
are
carried
out
when
we
take
them
in
hand
ourselves
she
exclaimed
all
the
spiritual
power
is
ours
and
while
we
refuse
to
know
it
must
be
wasted
for
want
of
direction
but
that
is
what
you
reject
said
father
ricardo
the
church
is
ever
ready
to
direct
her
children
for
her
own
advantage
and
very
badly
ideala
answered
does
her
direction
ever
benefit
the
human
race
generally
or
anybody
but
herself
in
particular
every
great
reform
has
been
forced
on
the
church
from
outside
just
consider
the
state
of
degradation
and
the
dense
ignorance
of
the
people
of
every
country
upon
which
the
curse
of
catholicism
rests
churches
and
monasteries
abound
the
people
are
backward
it
is
written
just
lately
there
has
been
a
little
revival
of
catholicism
a
flash
in
the
pan
here
in
england
due
to
cardinal
newman
and
cardinal
manning
who
introduced
some
good
old
protestant
virtues
into
your
teaching
but
that
can
not
last
you
carry
the
instrument
of
your
own
destruction
along
with
you
in
the
degrading
exercises
with
which
you
seek
to
debase
our
beautiful
wonderful
perfectible
human
nature
but
the
church
has
done
all
that
is
possible
for
the
people
father
ricardo
began
lamely
the
church
has
always
taught
for
one
thing
that
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
but
the
church
never
used
its
influence
to
make
the
hire
worthy
of
the
labourer
instead
of
that
it
has
always
sought
to
grind
the
last
penny
out
of
the
people
and
then
it
pauperized
them
with
alms
said
ideala
why
have
the
priests
done
so
little
good
uncle
dawne
diavolo
asked
because
they
are
no
better
than
other
people
was
the
answer
and
when
they
get
money
they
use
it
just
as
everybody
else
does
to
strengthen
their
own
position
and
make
a
display
with
ah
the
terrible
mistake
it
has
been
this
making
a
paid
profession
of
the
doing
of
good
ideala
exclaimed
angelica
who
had
put
her
arm
round
diavolo
again
and
was
sitting
with
her
head
against
his
listening
gravely
now
looked
at
ideala
i
want
to
know
where
the
true
spirit
of
god
is
she
said
i
can
tell
you
ideala
answered
fearlessly
it
is
in
us
have
preserved
it
and
handed
it
down
from
one
generation
to
another
of
our
own
sex
unsullied
and
very
soon
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
prove
the
possession
of
it
for
already
she
turned
to
father
ricardo
here
and
specially
addressed
him
speaking
always
in
gentle
tones
without
emphasis
already
i
that
is
to
say
woman
am
a
power
in
the
land
while
you
that
is
to
say
priest
retain
ever
less
and
less
even
of
the
semblance
of
power
pardon
me
dear
lady
the
priest
replied
but
it
shocks
me
to
hear
you
assume
such
an
arrogant
tone
i
do
think
the
tone
was
in
the
least
arrogant
angelica
put
in
briskly
and
at
any
rate
it
your
own
tone
exactly
for
i
heard
you
say
as
much
and
more
speaking
of
the
priesthood
not
exactly
diavolo
corrected
her
father
ricardo
always
says
for
some
great
inscrutable
purpose
has
mercifully
vouchsafed
this
wondrous
power
to
us
poor
or
humble
or
unworthy
the
first
adjective
of
that
kind
he
can
catch
i
like
the
short
way
of
putting
it
myself
but
why
do
you
always
try
to
make
out
that
it
is
our
duty
to
be
sinners
angelica
asked
if
we
taught
ourselves
to
be
happy
in
this
world
we
should
grow
to
love
it
too
much
and
then
we
should
not
strive
to
win
the
next
and
that
would
impoverish
the
church
diavolo
suggested
but
why
not
let
be
happy
and
you
raise
money
in
some
other
way
angelica
wanted
to
know
miracles
now
i
should
try
some
miracles
a
miracle
must
be
much
better
than
a
bazaar
to
raise
the
funds
oh
but
you
forget
the
nunneries
father
ricardo
was
telling
us
about
the
other
day
diavolo
said
the
austere
orders
where
they
only
live
a
few
years
you
know
i
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
but
i
read
up
the
subject
at
the
time
and
found
out
that
when
the
nuns
die
all
their
money
remains
in
the
church
is
that
what
you
mean
said
the
practical
angelica
yes
said
diavolo
you
see
it
would
hardly
cost
ten
shillings
a
week
to
keep
a
nun
and
of
course
he
said
to
father
ricardo
the
more
fasting
you
counsel
the
less
outlay
there
would
be
so
i
do
wonder
you
promise
them
more
goodies
in
the
next
world
the
more
austerities
they
practise
in
this
it
must
really
work
like
a
provision
of
nature
for
the
enrichment
of
holy
church
so
many
nuns
worked
off
on
the
prayer
and
fasting
mill
per
annum
so
many
unencumbered
fortunes
added
to
the
establishment
angelica
observed
jerusalem
said
diavolo
how
easy
it
is
to
gull
the
public
the
heavenly
twins
had
been
speaking
in
a
confidential
tone
as
if
they
were
behind
the
scenes
with
father
ricardo
and
now
they
watched
him
seeming
to
wait
for
him
to
wink
at
least
that
was
how
galbraith
afterward
interpreted
the
look
nothing
of
this
kind
coming
to
pass
however
they
both
got
up
and
both
together
strolled
out
of
the
room
yawning
undisguisedly
that
child
angelica
will
be
one
of
us
ideala
whispered
to
lord
dawne
yes
he
answered
gravely
they
will
both
be
of
us
eventually
only
we
must
make
no
move
but
wait
in
patience
the
day
break
and
the
shadows
flee
away
chapter
iv
there
was
much
high
talk
of
doing
good
and
living
for
others
at
morne
in
these
days
to
which
the
twins
listened
attentively
it
is
evident
from
the
thoughts
they
expressed
at
this
time
that
the
minds
of
both
were
in
a
state
of
fermentation
and
that
the
more
active
pursuits
in
which
they
still
indulged
occasionally
were
the
mere
outcome
of
habit
when
the
conversation
was
interesting
they
would
sit
beside
father
ricardo
whom
they
insisted
on
classing
with
themselves
as
an
inferior
being
and
watch
the
speakers
by
the
hour
together
and
father
ricardo
too
gauging
his
moral
temperature
and
noting
every
sigh
of
pity
or
shiver
of
disapprobation
that
shook
his
sensitive
frame
where
does
it
hurt
you
diavolo
asked
him
once
i
know
you
are
a
bad
bad
man
because
you
say
so
yourself
i
never
said
so
father
ricardo
exclaimed
with
a
puzzled
air
well
you
said
you
were
a
miserable
sinner
not
worthy
and
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
diavolo
rejoined
and
i
do
wonder
you
are
disheartened
when
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
you
to
be
as
disinterestedly
good
as
uncle
dawne
and
galbraith
i
feel
so
myself
sometimes
oh
i
hope
i
am
disinterested
father
ricardo
protested
i
ca
make
it
out
if
you
are
said
diavolo
shaking
his
head
you
do
seem
to
love
goodness
for
its
own
sake
but
for
the
reward
here
and
hereafter
the
whole
system
you
preach
is
one
of
reward
and
punishment
father
ricardo
had
an
innocent
hobby
he
was
fond
of
old
china
and
had
made
a
beautiful
collection
with
the
help
of
such
friends
as
lord
dawne
galbraith
and
lady
adeline
who
never
failed
to
bring
him
back
any
good
specimen
they
might
find
in
the
course
of
their
travels
one
day
at
this
time
after
the
talk
had
been
running
as
usual
upon
and
living
for
others
he
invited
the
whole
party
to
inspect
his
collection
and
they
all
went
with
the
exception
of
the
heavenly
twins
who
were
not
to
be
found
at
the
moment
when
the
others
reached
the
room
in
which
father
ricardo
kept
his
treasures
however
they
were
surprised
to
find
the
cabinets
comparatively
speaking
bare
and
with
great
gaps
on
the
shelves
as
if
someone
had
been
weeding
them
indiscriminately
the
good
father
looked
very
blank
at
first
but
the
windows
were
wide
open
and
before
he
could
think
what
had
happened
a
noise
on
the
lawn
below
attracted
everybody
attention
and
on
looking
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
they
beheld
the
heavenly
twins
apparently
intent
upon
organizing
a
revel
they
were
very
busy
at
the
moment
and
had
been
for
some
hours
evidently
for
they
had
collected
an
organ
man
with
a
monkey
a
wandering
musician
with
a
harp
a
man
with
a
hammer
who
had
been
engaged
in
breaking
stones
a
punch
and
judy
party
consisting
of
a
man
woman
and
boy
with
their
five
christy
minstrels
in
their
war
paint
a
respectable
looking
mechanic
with
his
wife
and
three
children
who
were
tramping
from
one
place
to
another
in
search
of
work
and
a
blind
beggar
and
all
these
were
seated
in
more
or
less
awkward
and
constrained
attitudes
on
covered
with
satin
velvet
or
brocade
about
the
lawn
with
little
tables
before
them
on
which
was
spread
all
the
cooked
food
apparently
that
the
castle
contained
when
their
admiring
relatives
first
caught
sight
of
the
twins
angelica
who
had
coiled
up
her
hair
and
wore
a
long
black
dress
borrowed
from
her
aunt
fulda
wardrobe
a
white
apron
with
a
bib
and
a
white
cap
like
a
nurse
the
property
of
one
of
the
lady
maids
was
pouring
tea
out
of
a
silver
urn
and
diavolo
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
serviette
under
his
arm
like
a
waiter
in
a
restaurant
was
standing
beside
her
with
a
salver
in
his
hand
waiting
to
carry
it
to
the
mechanic
lady
what
on
earth
are
you
children
doing
lord
dawne
exclaimed
feeding
the
hungry
sir
diavolo
drawled
cheerfully
well
groaned
the
poor
priest
you
need
have
taken
all
my
best
china
for
that
purpose
we
did
that
sir
diavolo
replied
with
dignity
in
order
that
you
all
unworthy
as
you
are
might
have
the
pleasure
of
participating
in
this
good
work
but
there
he
said
to
angelica
i
told
you
he
would
appreciate
it
to
the
credit
of
the
heavenly
twins
and
their
guests
it
must
be
recorded
that
no
harm
happened
either
to
the
china
or
the
plate
the
next
day
was
a
saint
day
and
the
children
announced
at
breakfast
that
they
intended
to
keep
it
they
said
they
were
going
to
compose
a
religion
for
themselves
out
of
all
the
most
agreeable
practices
enjoined
by
other
religions
and
they
proposed
to
begin
by
making
that
day
a
holiday
ellis
would
have
remonstrated
at
the
waste
of
time
and
father
ricardo
at
the
absence
of
proper
intention
but
the
way
the
twins
had
put
the
proposition
happened
to
amuse
the
duke
and
therefore
they
gained
their
point
but
having
gained
it
they
did
not
know
very
well
what
to
do
with
themselves
angelica
would
make
plans
she
was
thinking
of
the
long
dress
she
had
worn
the
day
before
and
feeling
a
vague
desire
to
have
her
own
lengthened
and
she
wanted
also
to
take
that
mysterious
packet
known
as
her
work
to
her
aunt
fulda
sitting
room
where
the
ladies
usually
spent
the
morning
so
as
to
be
with
them
but
she
knew
that
diavolo
would
scorn
her
if
she
did
and
the
outcome
of
all
this
vagueness
of
intention
was
a
fit
of
excessive
irritability
she
wanted
sympathy
but
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
herself
and
the
way
she
set
about
obtaining
it
was
by
being
excessively
disagreeable
to
everybody
there
was
a
rose
in
a
glass
beside
her
plate
and
she
took
it
out
and
began
to
twiddle
it
between
her
fingers
and
thumb
impatiently
till
she
managed
to
prick
herself
with
the
thorns
and
then
she
complained
of
the
pain
oh
that
sort
of
thing
does
hurt
much
diavolo
declared
it
hurt
she
maintained
aggressively
and
pain
is
pain
whether
the
seat
of
it
be
your
head
heart
or
lady
fulda
exclaimed
with
tragic
emphasis
someone
must
really
talk
to
you
you
are
positively
thank
heaven
angelica
ejaculated
fervently
i
knew
i
was
going
to
be
something
she
get
up
as
she
spoke
and
walked
out
of
the
room
with
her
head
in
the
air
affecting
a
proud
consciousness
of
having
had
greatness
suddenly
thrust
upon
her
lady
fulda
looked
helplessly
first
at
father
ricardo
then
at
ellis
ca
you
do
something
she
said
to
the
latter
ellis
replied
by
an
almost
imperceptible
shrug
of
his
shoulders
we
know
better
than
to
interfere
when
she
in
one
of
her
tantrums
diavolo
explained
when
his
grandfather
left
the
table
he
followed
him
uninvited
on
a
tour
of
inspection
around
the
castle
and
grounds
and
finally
retiring
with
him
to
the
library
whither
the
old
duke
usually
went
to
rest
read
or
meditate
sometime
during
the
morning
he
coiled
himself
up
in
an
armchair
took
a
small
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
to
study
it
dilligently
his
grandfather
glanced
at
him
affectionately
and
with
interest
from
time
to
time
he
was
lonely
in
his
old
age
and
liked
to
have
the
boy
about
he
had
nobody
left
to
him
now
who
could
touch
his
heart
or
take
him
out
of
himself
as
diavolo
did
for
nobody
else
attached
themselves
to
him
in
the
same
way
or
showed
such
an
unaffected
preference
for
having
him
all
to
themselves
what
are
you
reading
sir
he
asked
him
at
last
sir
diavolo
answered
glancing
over
the
top
of
his
book
for
a
moment
as
he
spoke
i
just
where
hippolytus
exclaims
jove
wherefore
indeed
didst
thou
place
in
the
light
of
the
sun
that
specious
evil
to
men
woman
are
you
reading
with
a
his
grandfather
asked
sternly
no
i
am
reading
a
key
to
diavolo
answered
do
you
know
your
greek
sir
his
grandfather
demanded
i
just
looking
to
see
sir
diavolo
rejoined
returning
to
his
book
when
he
had
finished
the
page
he
looked
up
at
his
grandfather
who
was
sitting
with
his
hands
folded
upon
a
large
volume
he
held
open
on
his
knee
meditating
apparently
beastly
bad
tone
about
women
in
the
classics
diavolo
remarked
you
think
so
sir
ah
my
boy
you
do
know
women
yet
the
old
duke
responded
then
i
not
made
the
most
of
my
opportunities
diavolo
said
with
a
grin
for
we
meet
with
a
fine
variety
in
the
houses
about
here
but
what
i
object
to
in
these
classical
chaps
he
resumed
is
the
way
they
sneaked
and
snivelled
about
women
faults
as
if
they
had
none
of
their
own
and
then
their
mean
trick
of
going
back
upon
the
women
and
reproaching
them
with
their
misfortunes
what
do
you
mean
by
that
his
grandfather
asked
well
sir
i
suppose
you
would
call
old
age
a
misfortune
to
a
pretty
woman
diavolo
answered
and
just
look
at
the
language
in
which
that
fellow
horace
taunts
lydia
and
lyce
when
they
grow
old
and
after
the
sickening
way
he
fawned
upon
them
when
they
were
young
too
and
here
again
he
said
holding
up
his
book
is
that
fellow
hippolytus
just
because
one
woman
has
shocked
him
he
says
never
shall
i
be
satisfied
in
my
hatred
against
women
for
in
some
way
or
other
they
are
always
bad
and
a
little
further
back
too
he
scuffed
the
leaves
over
he
says
that
woman
is
a
great
evil
men
squander
away
the
wealth
of
their
houses
upon
them
if
the
men
were
such
superior
beings
why
do
they
show
it
somehow
horace
was
as
spiteful
himself
as
any
old
woman
we
should
have
called
him
a
cad
nowadays
and
all
this
abuse
he
shook
his
is
beastly
bad
form
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
he
ruffled
his
thick
as
he
spoke
and
yawned
in
conclusion
then
you
are
coming
out
as
a
champion
of
women
said
the
duke
oh
by
jove
no
diavolo
exclaimed
straightening
himself
i
the
conceit
to
suppose
they
would
accept
such
a
champion
and
besides
i
think
it
the
other
way
on
now
shall
want
champions
soon
you
see
in
the
old
days
women
were
so
ignorant
and
subdued
they
retaliate
or
fight
for
themselves
in
any
way
they
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
now
if
you
hit
a
woman
she
give
you
one
back
promptly
he
asseverated
rubbing
a
bump
on
his
head
suspiciously
she
put
you
in
or
revile
you
in
the
dailies
magazine
you
write
you
down
an
ass
in
a
novel
blackguard
you
in
choice
language
from
a
public
platform
or
paint
a
picture
of
you
which
will
make
you
wish
you
had
never
been
born
ridicule
he
ejaculated
lowering
his
voice
they
ridicule
you
that
the
worst
of
it
now
there
ideala
she
can
make
a
fellow
ridiculous
without
a
word
when
old
lord
groome
came
back
from
malta
the
other
day
he
called
and
began
to
jeer
at
churston
feet
for
being
big
and
ugly
ideala
let
him
finish
and
then
she
just
looked
down
at
his
own
feet
and
you
could
see
in
a
minute
that
he
wished
himself
an
eastern
potentate
with
petticoats
to
hide
them
under
for
they
were
ugly
enough
to
be
indecent
the
duke
stretched
out
one
of
his
own
miniature
models
of
feet
upon
this
and
glanced
at
it
complacently
where
do
you
get
all
these
ideas
he
asked
at
your
age
i
never
had
any
and
if
i
had
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
own
it
you
be
a
prig
sir
if
you
do
mind
do
mind
diavolo
rejoined
i
heard
you
say
that
ladies
dearly
love
a
prig
and
therefore
i
rather
think
of
cultivating
that
tone
you
should
have
been
sent
to
a
public
school
his
grandfather
said
it
would
have
made
a
man
of
you
oh
time
will
do
that
just
as
well
diavolo
answered
encouragingly
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
lady
fulda
entered
papa
may
i
speak
to
you
now
she
asked
and
diavolo
got
up
politely
and
lounged
off
to
look
for
angelica
he
did
not
succeed
in
finding
her
however
because
she
had
driven
into
morningquest
to
do
some
shopping
with
her
aunt
claudia
and
ideala
she
hated
shopping
as
a
rule
and
could
seldom
be
persuaded
to
do
any
but
that
morning
after
breakfast
she
had
gone
to
lady
fulda
room
where
the
three
ladies
were
sitting
and
after
fidgeting
them
to
death
by
wandering
up
and
down
doing
nothing
with
a
scowl
on
her
face
and
an
ugly
look
of
discontent
in
her
fine
dark
eyes
she
had
burst
out
suddenly
aunt
fulda
i
want
some
long
dresses
lady
fulda
looked
up
at
her
in
blank
amazement
but
lady
claudia
who
was
all
energy
rolled
up
her
work
on
the
instant
rang
the
bell
ordered
the
carriage
and
answered
come
then
and
get
what
you
like
and
ten
minutes
afterward
they
had
started
several
unsuccessful
attempts
had
been
made
to
persuade
angelica
to
wear
long
dresses
and
lady
claudia
felt
that
now
when
she
proposed
it
herself
it
would
never
do
to
check
the
impulse
and
accordingly
in
less
than
a
week
from
that
day
angelica
the
was
to
all
appearance
no
more
and
miss
astonished
the
neighbourhood
she
came
down
to
the
drawing
room
quite
shyly
in
her
first
long
dinner
dress
with
her
dark
hair
coiled
neatly
high
on
her
head
she
had
met
kilroy
on
the
stairs
and
he
had
looked
at
her
in
a
strange
startled
way
but
he
said
nothing
and
neither
did
anybody
else
when
she
entered
the
room
her
grandfather
however
opened
his
eyes
wide
when
he
saw
her
and
smiled
as
if
he
were
gratified
lord
dawne
gave
her
a
second
glance
and
seemed
a
little
sad
and
ideala
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
then
looked
into
her
face
for
a
moment
very
gravely
making
her
feel
as
if
she
were
on
the
eve
of
something
momentous
but
diavolo
would
not
look
at
her
a
second
time
one
glimpse
had
been
enough
for
him
and
during
the
whole
of
dinner
he
never
raised
his
eyes
his
uncle
dawne
saw
what
was
wrong
with
the
boy
and
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
sympathetically
he
meant
to
talk
to
him
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
table
but
diavolo
escaped
unobserved
before
he
could
carry
out
his
intention
ellis
however
had
seen
him
go
and
followed
him
he
found
him
in
the
schoolroom
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
his
slender
frame
all
shaken
with
great
convulsive
sobs
and
the
old
books
and
playthings
which
had
suddenly
assumed
for
him
the
bitterly
pathetic
interest
that
attaches
to
once
loved
things
when
they
are
carelessly
cast
aside
and
forgotten
scattered
about
him
ellis
sat
down
beside
him
and
touched
his
hand
and
tried
to
comfort
him
but
the
tutor
was
sad
at
heart
himself
before
very
long
however
angelica
burst
in
upon
them
with
her
hair
down
and
in
the
shortest
and
oldest
dress
she
possessed
her
passionate
love
for
her
brother
had
always
been
the
great
hopeful
and
redeeming
point
of
her
character
and
if
she
did
show
it
principally
by
banging
his
head
she
never
meant
to
hurt
him
almost
any
other
sister
would
have
owed
him
a
grudge
for
not
admiring
her
in
her
first
fine
gown
and
so
spoiling
her
pleasure
but
angelica
saw
that
he
was
thinking
that
the
old
days
were
over
and
there
had
come
a
change
now
which
would
divide
them
and
she
thought
only
of
the
pain
he
was
suffering
on
that
account
so
when
she
found
that
he
was
not
going
to
join
the
ladies
in
the
drawing
room
she
rushed
upstairs
to
her
own
room
which
her
maid
was
arranging
for
the
night
and
relieved
her
feelings
by
tearing
off
her
dinner
dress
rolling
it
in
a
whisp
and
throwing
it
at
the
woman
her
petticoats
followed
it
and
then
she
kicked
off
her
white
satin
shoes
one
of
which
lit
on
the
mantelpiece
the
other
on
the
dressing
table
and
tearing
out
her
hairpins
flung
them
about
the
floor
in
all
directions
my
old
brown
gown
elizabeth
she
demanded
stamping
what
the
matter
miss
but
angelica
had
snatched
the
gown
from
the
wardrobe
put
it
on
and
was
halfway
downstairs
buttoning
it
as
she
went
before
the
maid
could
finish
the
sentence
when
she
entered
the
schoolroom
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
diavolo
and
hugged
him
tight
as
if
she
been
going
to
lose
him
altogether
or
he
had
just
escaped
from
a
great
danger
i
wo
wear
long
dresses
if
you
do
like
them
she
protested
well
you
ca
go
about
like
that
he
grumbled
recovering
himself
the
moment
he
felt
her
close
to
him
again
and
struck
by
a
sense
of
impropriety
in
her
short
skirt
after
the
appearance
she
had
presented
in
the
long
one
you
look
like
a
beggar
well
if
i
wear
a
long
one
she
declared
it
shall
only
be
a
disguise
i
promise
you
i
be
just
as
bad
as
ever
in
it
and
she
drew
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
which
had
been
left
there
for
months
and
was
frowsy
and
wiped
her
own
eyes
and
diavolo
abruptly
your
feelings
are
quite
boggy
diavolo
she
said
giving
a
dry
sob
herself
as
she
spoke
you
ca
touch
them
at
all
without
coming
to
water
you
cry
when
you
laugh
ellis
had
stolen
softly
out
of
the
room
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
unobserved
and
now
the
twins
were
sitting
together
in
their
favourite
position
on
the
same
chair
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
angelica
dark
head
slanted
so
as
to
lean
against
diavolo
fair
one
he
had
rewarded
her
last
remark
with
a
melancholy
grin
but
the
clouds
had
broken
and
it
now
only
required
time
for
them
to
roll
away
you
get
a
moustache
in
time
angelica
proceeded
in
her
most
tone
i
can
see
signs
of
it
now
in
some
lights
only
so
fair
it
does
show
much
i
shave
it
to
make
it
darker
he
suggested
no
you
must
do
that
she
answered
because
that
make
it
coarse
and
i
want
you
to
have
one
like
uncle
dawne
but
when
it
comes
it
will
make
you
look
as
much
grown
up
as
my
long
dresses
do
me
and
then
study
some
art
and
practise
it
together
and
not
be
separated
all
our
lives
we
will
said
diavolo
but
i
think
we
ought
to
begin
at
once
angelica
added
thoughtfully
just
give
me
time
to
consider
and
come
out
into
the
grounds
for
a
frolic
i
feel
smothered
in
here
and
there
a

chapter
edith
beale
had
now
been
married
for
more
than
a
year
to
sir
mosley
menteith
and
the
whole
of
their
life
together
had
been
to
her
a
painful
period
of
gradual
disillusion
and
all
the
more
painful
because
she
was
totally
unprepared
even
for
the
possibility
of
any
troubles
of
the
kind
which
had
beset
her
parental
opinion
and
prejudice
ignorance
education
and
custom
had
combined
to
deceive
her
with
regard
to
the
transient
nature
of
her
own
feeling
for
her
lover
and
it
was
also
inevitable
that
she
should
lend
herself
enthusiastically
to
the
deception
for
who
would
not
believe
if
they
could
that
a
state
so
ecstatic
is
enduring
even
people
who
do
know
better
are
apt
to
persuade
themselves
that
an
exception
will
be
made
in
their
favour
and
this
being
so
it
naturally
follows
that
a
girl
like
edith
all
faith
and
fondness
is
foredoomed
by
every
circumstance
of
her
life
and
virtue
of
her
nature
to
make
the
fatal
mistake
but
as
evadne
told
her
passion
stands
midway
between
love
and
hate
and
is
an
introduction
to
either
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
menteith
had
been
the
kind
of
repentant
erring
sinner
she
imagined
him
her
first
wild
desire
would
have
cooled
down
into
the
lasting
joy
of
tranquil
love
menteith
however
was
not
at
all
that
kind
of
man
and
consequently
from
the
first
the
marriage
had
been
a
miserable
example
of
the
result
of
uniting
the
spiritual
or
better
part
of
human
nature
with
the
essentially
animal
or
most
degraded
side
of
it
in
that
position
there
was
just
one
hope
of
happiness
left
for
edith
and
that
was
in
her
children
if
such
a
woman
so
situated
can
be
happy
anywhere
it
will
be
in
her
nursery
but
edith
child
which
arrived
pretty
promptly
only
proved
to
be
another
whip
to
scourge
her
although
of
an
unmistakable
type
he
was
apparently
healthy
when
he
was
born
but
had
rapidly
degenerated
and
edith
herself
was
a
wreck
they
had
been
out
to
malta
for
a
short
time
but
had
come
home
menteith
being
invalided
and
were
now
at
a
bracing
place
trying
what
the
air
would
do
for
them
all
it
was
edith
habit
to
send
the
child
out
with
his
nurse
directly
after
breakfast
and
having
done
so
as
usual
one
morning
she
remained
alone
with
her
husband
in
the
breakfast
room
which
looked
out
upon
the
sands
she
had
her
hands
idly
folded
on
her
lap
and
was
watching
menteith
as
she
might
have
watched
a
stranger
about
whom
she
was
curious
he
sat
at
some
distance
from
her
reading
a
paper
and
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
him
but
she
had
changed
very
much
for
the
worse
why
was
she
not
recovering
her
strength
why
had
it
pleased
heaven
to
afflict
her
that
was
what
she
was
thinking
but
at
the
same
time
she
blamed
herself
for
repining
and
in
order
to
banish
the
thought
she
rose
and
going
over
to
her
husband
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
courting
a
caress
he
had
been
lavish
enough
of
caresses
at
first
but
all
that
was
over
now
and
he
finished
the
paragraph
he
was
reading
before
he
noticed
edith
at
all
then
he
glanced
at
her
but
his
eyes
were
cold
and
critical
you
certainly
are
not
looking
well
he
observed
evidently
meaning
not
attractive
as
if
he
were
injured
by
the
fact
he
got
up
when
he
had
spoken
so
that
in
the
act
of
rising
he
dislodged
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
then
he
yawned
and
lounged
over
to
the
window
which
was
wide
open
the
weather
being
warm
and
stood
there
with
his
legs
apart
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
out
one
little
loving
caress
or
kindly
word
would
have
changed
the
whole
direction
of
edith
thoughts
but
wanting
that
she
stood
where
he
had
left
her
for
some
moments
lost
in
pained
reflection
and
then
she
followed
him
listlessly
seated
herself
in
a
low
and
looked
out
also
there
were
crowds
of
people
on
the
sands
and
her
dull
eyes
wandered
from
group
to
group
then
up
to
the
sky
and
down
again
to
the
sea
and
shore
the
sun
shone
radiantly
sparkles
of
light
from
the
rippling
wavelets
responded
to
his
ardent
caress
the
air
fanned
her
face
but
neither
light
nor
air
nor
sound
availed
to
move
her
pleasurably
is
this
to
be
my
life
she
thought
the
tide
was
coming
in
over
the
sands
some
children
with
their
shoes
and
stockings
off
were
playing
close
to
the
water
edge
they
had
made
a
castle
and
were
standing
on
the
top
of
it
all
crowded
together
waiting
for
a
big
wave
to
come
and
surround
them
and
when
at
last
it
came
it
carried
half
their
fortress
away
with
it
and
they
all
hopped
off
into
the
water
and
splashed
up
through
it
with
shouts
of
laughter
to
the
dry
land
i
should
have
enjoyed
that
once
thought
edith
a
party
of
people
cantered
past
upon
donkeys
driven
by
boys
with
big
sticks
the
women
were
clinging
to
the
pommels
of
their
saddles
and
shrieking
as
they
bumped
along
while
the
men
shouted
and
beat
and
kicked
the
donkeys
with
all
their
might
horrid
common
cruel
people
thought
edith
how
dreadful
it
would
be
to
have
to
know
them
a
girl
came
riding
past
alone
on
a
hired
horse
she
wore
a
rusty
black
skirt
over
her
petticoats
it
was
gathered
in
by
a
drawing
string
at
the
waist
and
made
her
look
ludicrously
bunchy
her
stirrup
was
too
short
and
she
clung
desperately
with
both
hands
to
whip
and
reins
and
saddle
only
venturing
to
guide
her
horse
now
and
a
timid
half
apologetic
sort
of
way
as
if
she
were
afraid
he
would
resent
it
she
must
have
felt
far
from
comfortable
but
probably
the
dream
of
her
life
had
been
to
ride
and
now
that
she
was
riding
she
admired
herself
extremely
edith
involuntarily
drew
a
mental
picture
of
the
contrast
she
herself
presented
on
horseback
but
that
girl
is
well
and
happy
she
objected
to
her
own
disadvantage
she
became
aware
at
this
moment
of
another
girl
who
was
passing
on
foot
she
was
one
of
those
girls
of
the
middle
class
who
throng
to
fashionable
in
the
season
young
women
with
senses
rampant
and
minds
undisciplined
impelled
by
natural
instinct
to
find
a
mate
and
practising
every
little
art
of
dress
and
manner
which
they
imagine
will
help
them
to
that
end
by
making
them
attractive
their
object
is
always
evident
in
their
eyes
which
rove
from
man
to
man
pathetically
pleadingly
anxiously
mischievously
according
to
their
temperaments
but
always
with
the
same
inquiry
will
it
be
you
this
girl
had
made
herself
by
into
a
notable
specimen
of
the
figure
bulgy
at
the
bust
and
shoulders
and
tapering
off
at
the
waist
she
had
also
squeezed
her
feet
into
boots
that
were
much
too
small
for
them
and
fluffed
her
hair
out
till
her
head
seemed
preposterously
large
by
which
means
she
had
achieved
the
appearance
known
to
her
set
as
stylish
when
edith
first
saw
her
she
was
walking
along
very
quickly
with
a
dissatisfied
look
on
her
face
but
as
she
approached
the
window
she
glanced
up
and
seeing
menteith
her
countenance
cleared
and
she
slackened
her
speed
seeming
suddenly
to
become
uncertain
of
the
direction
she
wished
to
take
first
she
half
stopped
and
appeared
to
be
thinking
then
she
hastily
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
looked
back
the
way
she
had
come
as
if
she
had
lost
something
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
to
signify
that
it
did
much
matter
and
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
walked
slowly
into
the
sea
this
was
in
order
that
she
might
spring
nimbly
out
again
with
a
fine
pretence
of
confusion
at
her
affected
fit
of
menteith
watched
these
manoeuvres
attentively
patiently
awaiting
the
inevitable
moment
when
she
would
look
at
him
again
so
far
she
had
pretended
to
ignore
him
but
he
understood
her
tactics
and
as
he
observed
them
he
twisted
first
one
end
and
then
the
other
of
his
little
light
moustache
with
a
not
to
be
concealed
he
had
been
feeling
bored
all
the
morning
but
now
his
interest
in
life
revived
he
had
only
the
one
interest
in
life
and
when
the
girl
on
the
beach
had
done
all
she
could
to
excite
it
she
glanced
at
him
again
and
saw
by
the
look
with
which
he
responded
that
she
had
succeeded
then
she
sat
down
on
the
sand
placing
herself
so
that
she
could
meet
his
eyes
every
time
she
looked
up
and
taking
a
letter
out
of
her
pocket
she
began
to
read
it
varying
the
expression
of
her
countenance
the
while
to
show
that
she
derived
great
pleasure
from
the
perusal
this
was
to
pique
menteith
into
supposing
that
he
had
a
rival
the
girl
had
not
troubled
herself
about
edith
presence
but
the
latter
had
also
been
watching
her
wiles
dully
enough
however
until
all
at
once
a
thought
occurred
to
her
a
hateful
thought
it
was
the
emotional
rather
than
the
intellectual
side
of
her
nature
which
had
been
developed
by
early
associations
she
had
been
accustomed
to
feel
more
than
to
think
and
now
when
all
food
for
elevating
emotions
had
been
withdrawn
from
her
daily
life
others
mostly
of
a
distressing
kind
took
possession
of
her
mind
she
had
gone
through
all
the
phases
of
acute
misery
to
which
a
girl
so
trained
and
with
such
a
husband
is
liable
she
had
been
weakened
into
dependence
by
excess
of
sympathy
and
now
was
being
demoralised
for
want
of
any
menteith
had
hung
upon
her
words
at
first
had
been
responsive
to
her
every
glance
but
latterly
he
had
become
indifferent
to
both
and
she
knew
it
without
however
comprehending
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
change
or
of
the
growing
sense
of
something
wanting
which
was
fast
becoming
her
own
normal
condition
she
was
still
fighting
hard
to
preserve
the
spiritual
fervour
which
had
been
the
predominant
characteristic
of
her
girlhood
but
at
this
period
of
their
intercourse
she
knew
better
than
to
attempt
to
in
him
that
semblance
of
spirituality
which
had
deluded
her
in
their
early
but
she
had
from
the
first
cultivated
a
passive
attitude
toward
him
and
that
even
when
the
natural
instinct
of
her
womanhood
impelled
her
to
war
with
him
in
any
case
however
instinct
is
not
safeguard
enough
for
creatures
living
under
purely
artificial
conditions
they
must
have
knowledge
and
edith
had
been
robbed
of
all
means
of
by
the
teaching
which
insisted
that
her
only
duty
as
a
wife
consisted
in
silent
submission
to
her
husband
will
her
intellectual
life
such
as
it
was
had
stopped
short
from
the
time
of
her
intimate
association
with
menteith
and
her
spiritual
nature
had
been
starved
in
close
contact
with
him
only
her
senses
had
been
nourished
and
these
were
now
being
rendered
morbidly
active
by
disease
the
shadow
of
an
awful
form
of
insanity
already
darkened
her
days
the
mental
torture
was
extreme
but
she
fought
for
her
reason
with
the
fearful
malady
valiantly
and
all
the
time
presented
outwardly
only
the
same
dull
apathy
giving
no
sign
and
speaking
no
word
which
could
betray
the
fury
of
the
rage
within
this
last
thought
took
her
unawares
as
usual
and
followed
an
accustomed
course
she
had
entertained
it
for
a
moment
turning
it
over
in
her
mind
with
interest
before
she
realized
its
nature
when
she
did
so
however
her
soul
sickened
what
am
i
coming
to
she
mentally
ejaculated
recovering
herself
with
an
effort
which
resulted
also
in
a
sudden
resolution
i
want
to
go
home
she
said
her
voice
was
very
husky
menteith
startled
from
the
absorbing
occupation
of
ogling
the
girl
on
the
beach
looked
at
her
sharply
had
she
noticed
what
he
was
up
to
and
was
she
jealous
by
any
chance
as
these
confounded
unreasonable
women
are
apt
to
be
no
he
concluded
after
carefully
scrutinizing
her
face
and
attitude
there
was
not
a
trace
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
she
evidently
only
meant
what
she
had
said
and
by
jove
he
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
for
she
looking
anything
but
nice
at
present
marriage
is
certainly
a
lottery
a
fellow
chooses
a
girl
for
her
health
and
beauty
and
gives
her
everything
she
can
want
in
the
world
and
in
less
than
a
year
she
a
wreck
the
injury
done
to
himself
implied
in
this
last
reflection
caused
a
certain
amount
of
irritation
which
betrayed
itself
in
the
politely
nagging
tone
of
his
reply
what
precisely
do
you
mean
by
he
asked
i
mean
morningquest
she
answered
ah
he
ejaculated
that
was
what
i
inferred
i
hope
i
have
not
said
anything
to
annoy
you
she
exclaimed
oh
dear
no
he
assured
her
i
know
your
sex
too
well
to
be
annoyed
by
any
of
its
caprices
but
still
he
added
a
wife
does
not
usually
make
her
with
her
parents
but
we
have
no
settled
home
she
remonstrated
do
you
mean
that
for
a
reproach
because
my
want
of
means
at
present
obliges
me
to
keep
my
houses
shut
up
he
asked
no
she
answered
with
a
gleam
of
spirit
and
you
know
i
do
not
there
was
a
pause
after
this
it
pleased
him
to
make
her
ask
for
his
permission
to
go
to
her
mother
in
so
many
words
he
perceived
that
she
found
it
difficult
to
do
so
and
there
was
satisfaction
in
the
respect
and
fear
which
he
thought
were
betokened
by
her
hesitation
the
sense
of
power
and
possession
flattered
his
and
enlivened
him
do
you
object
she
ventured
at
last
to
what
dear
he
asked
without
interrupting
an
exchange
of
amorous
glances
which
was
just
then
going
on
between
himself
and
the
girl
on
the
beach
to
my
going
home
oh
no
he
exclaimed
smiling
only
to
that
way
of
putting
it
by
the
way
he
added
pleasantly
taking
up
a
pair
of
opera
glasses
that
were
lying
on
a
table
beside
him
and
adjusting
the
sight
shall
i
accompany
you
edith
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
would
as
they
had
never
yet
been
separated
since
their
marriage
and
the
question
striking
as
it
did
another
note
of
change
surprised
and
hurt
her
but
as
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
have
asked
it
had
he
wished
to
go
she
answered
quietly
oh
no
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
it
would
be
no
trouble
i
assure
you
he
answered
confirming
her
first
impression
that
he
did
not
wish
to
go
oh
no
she
repeated
i
could
not
think
of
taking
you
away
from
here
if
the
air
is
doing
you
good
ah
well
he
answered
catching
at
the
excuse
i
suppose
i
ought
to
forego
the
pleasure
for
i
am
just
beginning
at
last
to
feel
some
benefit
from
the
change
and
i
should
probably
lose
the
little
good
it
has
done
me
if
i
go
away
now
morningquest
is
relaxing
however
i
shall
join
you
as
soon
as
i
can
you
know
this
was
said
with
a
plausible
affectation
of
being
impelled
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
act
contrary
to
his
inclination
which
did
not
however
impose
upon
edith
and
the
thought
that
the
wish
to
be
with
her
now
was
not
imperative
she
was
ill
became
another
haunting
torment
during
the
short
remaining
time
they
were
together
but
happily
for
herself
she
never
perceived
that
he
did
not
care
to
accompany
her
principally
she
was
she
left
that
afternoon
with
her
servants
and
child
and
he
saw
to
the
preparations
for
their
departure
with
cheerful
alacrity
she
was
depressed
and
he
told
her
she
must
keep
up
her
spirits
for
everybody
sake
and
set
her
a
good
example
by
keeping
his
own
up
manfully
he
saw
her
off
at
the
station
and
stood
smiling
and
bowing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
until
she
was
out
of
sight
and
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
with
a
jaunty
air
to
look
for
the
girl
on
the
beach
up
to
the
last
moment
edith
would
have
been
thankful
for
any
excuse
to
change
her
mind
and
stay
but
when
she
found
herself
alone
and
the
journey
had
fairly
begun
she
experienced
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
she
had
not
realized
the
fact
but
latterly
her
husband
presence
had
oppressed
her
chapter
vi
the
beales
had
not
seen
their
daughter
and
grandson
for
some
months
and
the
appearance
of
both
was
a
shock
to
them
they
said
not
a
word
to
each
other
at
first
but
neither
of
them
could
help
looking
at
edith
furtively
from
time
to
time
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
when
the
bishop
came
up
to
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
and
had
settled
himself
in
his
accustomed
edith
had
crept
to
his
side
and
slipping
her
hand
through
his
arm
sat
leaning
her
head
against
his
shoulder
and
staring
straight
before
her
neither
speaking
nor
listening
except
when
directly
addressed
her
father
between
whom
and
herself
there
had
always
been
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
was
inexpressively
touched
by
this
silent
appeal
to
his
love
and
letting
the
paper
lie
on
his
lap
he
sat
silent
also
and
serious
feeling
without
in
any
way
knowing
that
all
was
not
well
beale
was
also
depressed
although
she
assured
herself
again
and
again
that
such
deep
devotion
between
father
and
daughter
was
an
elevating
and
beautiful
sight
which
it
was
a
privilege
to
witness
and
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
they
were
all
extremely
happy
in
the
tranquil
joy
of
this
peaceful
evening
spent
alone
together
with
the
world
shut
out
that
child
is
not
right
the
bishop
said
when
edith
had
gone
to
bed
have
you
noticed
her
face
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
at
all
not
at
all
is
that
rather
unkind
dear
beale
replied
i
always
recovered
in
time
you
never
were
as
ill
as
the
poor
child
evidently
is
he
answered
and
retired
to
his
library
much
disturbed
but
beale
determined
not
to
worry
herself
and
managed
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
her
mind
until
next
day
when
she
was
sitting
alone
with
her
daughter
in
the
morning
room
up
stairs
they
were
both
working
but
the
conversation
flagged
and
beale
from
wondering
why
edith
was
so
uncommunicative
found
herself
involuntarily
repeating
the
observation
that
child
is
not
right
and
the
question
what
is
the
matter
with
your
face
dearest
slipped
from
her
unawares
i
do
know
mother
edith
answered
shortly
she
had
never
before
in
her
life
spoken
to
her
mother
in
that
tone
and
the
latter
was
surprised
and
hurt
for
a
moment
but
then
persuaded
herself
that
some
irritability
was
only
natural
if
the
child
were
out
of
health
and
at
once
made
proper
allowances
edith
got
up
when
she
had
spoken
and
left
the
room
she
was
occupying
one
of
the
state
departments
of
the
palace
then
but
on
the
way
to
it
she
had
to
pass
the
room
which
had
been
hers
as
a
girl
the
door
was
open
and
she
went
in
nothing
was
changed
there
but
the
moment
she
entered
she
felt
that
there
was
a
direful
difference
in
herself
the
sad
benignant
christ
with
tender
sympathetic
eyes
looked
down
upon
her
from
the
picture
on
the
wall
but
she
returned
the
glance
indifferently
at
first
and
then
remembering
the
rapture
with
which
she
had
been
wont
to
kneel
at
his
feet
she
looked
again
the
recollection
of
the
once
dear
delight
tantalized
her
now
however
because
it
did
not
renew
it
and
turning
from
the
picture
impatiently
she
went
to
the
window
and
there
sank
on
to
the
seat
from
whence
she
had
looked
out
at
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
it
had
been
arranged
that
she
should
winter
with
her
mother
at
malta
and
here
again
she
endeavoured
to
recall
the
glow
of
sensation
which
had
thrilled
her
then
but
only
the
lifeless
ashes
of
that
fire
remained
and
they
were
burnt
out
past
all
hope
of
rekindling
them
even
the
remembrance
of
what
her
feelings
had
been
eluded
her
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
after
experiences
experiences
of
her
married
life
and
those
precisely
which
it
was
not
wise
to
recall
they
were
not
exactly
thoughts
however
that
occupied
her
but
emotions
to
which
looking
out
on
the
sunlit
garden
with
rounded
eyes
and
pupils
dilated
to
the
uttermost
she
had
unconsciously
lent
herself
for
some
time
as
on
other
occasions
before
she
realized
what
she
was
doing
suddenly
however
she
came
to
her
senses
and
fled
in
affright
to
the
morning
room
where
she
threw
herself
down
on
her
knees
beside
her
mother
impetuously
and
buried
her
face
in
her
lap
take
care
dear
child
beale
exclaimed
you
will
hurt
yourself
mother
mother
edith
cried
i
have
such
terrible
terrible
thoughts
i
can
not
control
them
i
can
not
keep
them
away
the
torment
of
my
mind
is
awful
i
could
kill
myself
beale
turned
pale
pray
dearest
she
ejaculated
i
do
i
do
mother
edith
wailed
but
they
mingle
with
my
prayers
god
is
a
demon
is
he
beale
threw
her
arms
round
her
daughter
and
almost
shook
her
in
her
consternation
edith
darling
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
she
demanded
edith
looked
into
her
face
in
a
bewildered
way
no
mother
what
was
it
she
answered
then
all
outward
sign
of
beale
agitation
subsided
some
shocks
stun
and
some
strengthen
and
steady
us
the
piteous
appeal
in
eyes
the
puzzle
and
the
pain
of
her
face
as
she
made
an
effort
to
recall
her
words
and
understand
them
had
the
latter
effect
upon
her
mother
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
weak
dear
child
the
poor
lady
bravely
responded
weakness
makes
people
you
must
see
the
doctor
and
have
a
tonic
the
doctor
again
edith
groaned
it
has
been
nothing
but
the
doctor
and
ever
since
i
have
been
married
what
does
he
say
is
the
matter
exactly
beale
asked
all
his
endeavour
seems
to
be
not
to
say
what
is
the
matter
exactly
edith
replied
beale
reflected
caressing
her
daughter
the
while
and
under
the
soothing
influence
of
her
loving
touch
edith
countenance
began
to
relax
when
is
mosley
coming
her
mother
said
at
last
edith
face
contracted
again
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
do
know
mother
she
answered
coldly
the
chime
rang
out
at
this
moment
and
she
frowned
as
she
listened
to
it
i
wish
those
bells
could
be
stopped
she
exclaimed
they
deafen
me
beale
had
also
risen
from
her
chair
smiling
mechanically
but
with
pain
and
perplexity
at
her
heart
i
am
sure
it
is
the
journey
she
said
it
has
quite
upset
you
your
nerves
are
all
jarred
you
must
really
lie
down
for
a
little
see
dearest
here
on
the
couch
and
keep
quite
quiet
she
arranged
the
cushions
come
dear
she
urged
like
a
good
child
and
i
will
cover
you
up
edith
had
been
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
gentle
compulsion
all
her
life
and
as
she
yielded
to
it
now
she
began
to
feel
more
like
herself
i
knew
i
should
be
better
with
you
mother
she
said
sighing
and
then
she
reached
up
her
arm
and
drew
her
mother
face
down
to
hers
kiss
me
mother
and
tell
me
you
forgive
me
for
being
impatient
dear
child
you
are
not
impatient
her
mother
answered
adding
to
herself
as
she
returned
to
her
seat
i
hope
it
is
only
impatience
edith
had
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
soon
appeared
to
be
asleep
then
her
mother
went
down
to
the
library
the
bishop
rose
from
his
writing
table
when
she
entered
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
be
polite
to
his
wife
i
think
you
were
right
last
night
about
edith
she
said
she
is
not
as
she
should
be
write
to
galbraith
ask
him
to
come
here
ask
him
to
dine
and
stay
the
night
as
if
it
were
only
an
ordinary
visit
not
to
alarm
her
you
know
but
tell
him
why
we
want
him
to
come
i
am
nervous
about
her
beale
face
quivered
and
she
burst
into
tears
as
she
spoke
oh
my
dear
i
am
sure
there
is
no
need
to
agitate
yourself
the
bishop
exclaimed
now
do
now
do
really
see
i
will
write
at
once
he
sat
down
and
began
my
dear
george
and
then
looked
up
at
his
wife
to
see
if
she
were
not
already
relieved
beale
could
not
speak
but
she
stroked
his
head
once
or
twice
in
acknowledgment
of
his
great
kindness
then
more
tears
came
because
he
so
very
kind
and
finally
she
was
obliged
to
go
to
her
own
room
to
recover
herself
as
the
day
wore
on
however
she
became
reassured
edith
seemed
much
refreshed
by
her
sleep
and
in
the
afternoon
when
the
three
ladies
came
from
the
castle
to
call
upon
her
bringing
angelica
with
them
she
quite
roused
up
what
angelica
a
grown
up
young
lady
in
a
long
dress
she
exclaimed
but
where
is
diavolo
we
had
a
slight
difference
of
opinion
this
morning
angelica
answered
stiffly
dear
me
that
is
a
new
thing
beale
commented
no
it
is
not
angelica
contradicted
bridling
visibly
only
when
we
were
younger
we
used
to
settle
our
differences
at
once
and
have
done
with
them
but
now
that
i
am
in
long
dresses
diavolo
wo
do
that
so
we
have
to
sulk
like
married
people
but
my
dear
child
i
do
see
why
you
should
quarrel
at
all
beale
remonstrated
you
would
if
you
were
with
us
i
expect
angelica
answered
and
then
she
turned
her
attention
to
edith
but
not
by
a
sign
did
she
betray
the
slightest
consciousness
of
the
latter
disfigurement
unless
making
herself
unusually
agreeable
was
a
symptom
of
commiseration
and
in
this
she
succeeded
so
thoroughly
that
when
the
others
rose
to
go
edith
did
not
feel
inclined
to
part
with
her
wo
you
stay
with
me
here
a
few
days
she
entreated
angelica
reflected
it
would
do
him
good
i
should
think
she
said
at
last
i
should
think
it
would
edith
agreed
laughing
did
i
speak
said
angelica
yes
edith
answered
you
informed
me
that
you
are
going
to
stay
here
in
order
to
punish
diavolo
by
depriving
him
of
your
society
for
a
time
i
am
sure
i
did
not
say
all
that
angelica
exclaimed
well
not
exactly
perhaps
edith
confessed
but
you
led
me
to
infer
it
well
i
will
stay
angelica
decided
aunt
fulda
i
going
to
stay
here
for
a
few
days
with
edith
she
answered
very
well
dear
her
aunt
meekly
rejoined
are
you
going
to
stay
now
yes
tell
elizabeth
to
bring
me
some
wearing
apparel
as
they
drove
back
to
morne
lady
claudia
scolded
lady
fulda
for
so
weakly
allowing
angelica
to
have
her
own
way
in
everything
i
thought
you
would
agree
with
me
that
the
sweet
womanly
influence
at
the
palace
would
do
her
good
lady
fulda
answered
in
an
injured
tone
womanly
said
lady
claude
she
will
twist
them
all
round
her
little
finger
and
turn
the
whole
place
upside
down
before
she
leaves
or
i
am
much
mistaken
well
dear
if
you
would
only
make
angelica
do
what
wish
while
you
are
here
to
influence
her
i
should
be
thankful
lady
fulda
rejoined
with
gentle
dignity
lady
claudia
said
no
more
things
went
merrily
at
the
palace
for
the
rest
of
the
day
orton
beg
called
and
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
between
whom
and
angelica
there
was
always
an
excellent
understanding
and
she
entertained
him
now
with
observations
and
anecdotes
which
so
amused
edith
that
as
beale
said
to
the
bishop
afterward
the
dear
naughty
child
quite
took
her
out
of
herself
angelica
had
never
been
in
the
same
house
with
a
baby
before
and
she
was
all
interest
whatever
defects
of
character
the
new
women
may
eventually
acquire
lack
of
maternal
affection
will
not
be
one
of
them
have
you
seen
the
baby
she
asked
elizabeth
when
the
latter
was
brushing
her
hair
for
dinner
he
had
not
been
visible
during
the
afternoon
but
angelica
had
thought
of
him
incessantly
yes
miss
elizabeth
answered
is
he
a
pretty
baby
angelica
wanted
to
know
elizabeth
pursed
up
her
lips
with
an
air
of
reserve
you
do
think
so
angelica
said
she
had
seen
the
maid
face
in
the
mirror
before
her
what
is
he
like
he
exactly
like
the
bishop
miss
angelica
broke
into
a
broad
smile
at
herself
in
the
glass
what
a
little
old
man
baby
she
exclaimed
yes
miss
with
a
cold
in
his
head
the
maid
said
seriously
when
she
was
dressed
angelica
went
to
make
his
acquaintance
on
the
way
she
discovered
her
particular
friend
the
bishop
going
furtively
in
the
same
direction
and
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
we
go
together
she
said
confidentially
taking
it
for
granted
that
his
errand
was
the
same
as
her
own
the
nurse
was
undressing
the
child
when
they
entered
and
edith
sat
watching
her
she
was
already
dressed
for
the
evening
and
looked
worse
in
an
elaborate
toilet
than
she
had
done
in
her
morning
dress
a
stranger
would
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
only
the
year
before
she
had
been
radiantly
healthy
and
beautiful
the
puzzled
pathetic
expression
again
in
her
eyes
as
she
watched
the
child
she
had
no
smile
for
him
and
uttered
no
baby
words
to
him
nor
had
he
a
smile
for
her
he
was
old
old
already
and
exhausted
with
suffering
and
as
his
gaze
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
he
was
asking
each
dumbly
why
had
he
ever
been
born
is
edith
baby
angelica
exclaimed
in
her
astonishment
and
horror
under
her
breath
slipping
her
hand
from
the
bishop
arm
she
had
seen
enough
in
one
momentary
glance
and
she
fled
from
the
room
the
bishop
followed
her
beale
was
there
when
they
entered
standing
behind
her
daughter
chair
but
she
did
not
look
at
her
husband
nor
he
at
her
for
the
first
time
in
their
married
life
poor
souls
they
were
afraid
to
meet
each
other
eyes
chapter
vii
next
day
in
the
afternoon
beale
being
otherwise
engaged
edith
proposed
that
she
and
angelica
should
go
for
a
drive
together
edith
was
feeling
better
and
angelica
had
recovered
her
equanimity
she
suggested
that
they
should
drive
toward
fountain
towers
edith
had
not
been
on
that
road
since
her
marriage
and
when
they
passed
the
place
where
she
and
her
mother
had
seen
the
young
french
girl
lying
insensible
on
the
pathway
with
her
baby
beside
her
she
was
reminded
of
the
incident
and
described
it
to
angelica
adding
i
have
so
often
longed
to
know
what
became
of
her
i
can
tell
you
said
angelica
i
know
her
quite
well
by
sight
she
is
living
with
nurse
griffiths
in
honeysuckle
cottage
on
estate
nurse
griffiths
told
us
he
brought
her
there
one
day
in
his
carriage
very
ill
and
she
has
been
there
ever
since
he
always
gets
angry
and
snaps
at
you
if
he
bothered
about
anybody
who
ill
or
unfortunate
and
diavolo
and
i
met
him
that
day
coming
away
from
the
cottage
and
he
spoke
to
us
so
shortly
we
were
sure
there
was
something
bad
the
matter
so
we
went
to
see
what
it
was
and
nurse
griffiths
said
she
was
french
not
been
there
since
but
i
expect
it
the
same
girl
shall
we
stop
and
see
we
pass
the
end
of
the
lane
where
the
cottage
is
edith
agreed
eagerly
she
said
it
would
be
a
relief
to
her
mind
to
know
that
the
girl
was
well
cared
for
and
happy
oh
everybody
is
well
cared
for
and
happy
on
galbraith
estate
said
angelica
his
tenants
worship
him
and
they
would
rather
be
abused
by
him
than
complimented
by
anybody
else
the
cottage
covered
with
the
honeysuckle
from
which
it
took
its
name
stood
in
a
large
garden
at
the
edge
of
a
fir
plantation
which
sheltered
it
from
the
northeast
wind
at
the
back
and
filled
the
air
about
it
with
balsamic
fragrance
edith
and
angelica
left
the
carriage
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
walked
up
what
a
lovely
spot
edith
exclaimed
on
a
still
bright
day
like
this
it
makes
one
realize
what
the
saints
meant
by
calm
i
think
i
should
like
to
live
in
such
a
place
and
never
hear
another
echo
from
the
outside
world
i
suppose
you
would
just
like
to
add
dear
mosley
to
the
establishment
angelica
suggested
edith
heart
contracted
she
had
not
thought
of
her
husband
and
now
when
she
did
it
was
with
a
pang
because
she
could
not
include
him
in
her
idea
of
eden
the
french
girl
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
with
a
child
in
her
arms
is
nurse
griffiths
in
angelica
asked
edith
looked
at
the
child
it
should
have
been
running
about
by
that
time
but
it
was
small
and
rickety
with
bones
that
bent
beneath
its
weight
slight
as
it
was
edith
had
looked
at
it
first
with
some
interest
but
its
unhealthy
appearance
repelled
her
she
managed
however
to
speak
to
the
girl
about
it
kindly
what
is
your
baby
name
she
asked
mosley
menteith
was
the
answer
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
edith
as
if
all
the
world
were
blotted
out
and
then
again
the
hum
of
bees
the
chirrup
of
birds
the
fall
of
a
the
call
of
the
in
the
wood
sounded
obtrusively
making
the
girl
voice
as
she
continued
speaking
appear
far
off
and
indistinct
i
called
him
after
his
father
then
did
i
she
was
saying
to
the
baby
in
good
english
but
with
a
french
accent
and
he
to
grow
up
and
be
a
big
strong
fellow
and
beat
his
father
is
he
for
he
a
bad
bad
man
nurse
griffiths
hearing
voices
in
the
porch
came
out
hush
louise
she
said
to
the
girl
you
no
call
to
talk
in
that
way
now
you
must
excuse
her
she
added
to
the
ladies
she
had
a
bad
bringing
up
i
ca
believe
you
edith
faltered
tell
me
exactly
well
it
was
in
this
way
the
girl
rejoined
speaking
in
the
prosaic
tone
in
which
her
countrywomen
are
accustomed
to
discuss
matters
that
inspire
ours
with
too
much
disgust
to
be
mentioned
menteith
came
after
me
and
my
sister
wanted
money
so
she
made
me
believe
that
he
marry
me
because
there
was
a
law
to
prevent
it
she
said
he
loved
me
and
if
i
loved
him
well
enough
it
would
be
a
noble
thing
to
disregard
the
law
and
he
gave
her
pounds
for
that
i
found
her
letter
to
menteith
about
it
and
i
got
it
here
tapping
the
bosom
of
her
gown
he
took
me
abroad
when
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
and
left
me
in
paris
with
five
pounds
in
my
pocket
but
it
was
enough
to
bring
me
back
i
was
sick
when
i
landed
at
dover
and
they
sent
me
to
the
workhouse
and
when
i
got
well
again
i
told
them
i
had
friends
in
morningquest
and
they
gave
me
a
little
help
to
get
there
but
i
had
to
tramp
most
of
the
way
and
i
was
weak
i
could
have
got
as
far
as
i
did
if
i
had
wanted
to
kill
them
both
now
hush
said
nurse
griffiths
the
lord
saved
you
from
such
a
sin
the
lord
said
the
girl
derisively
if
the
lord
had
been
inclined
to
help
me
he
would
have
waited
till
i
came
to
murder
it
was
the
lord
saved
she
will
say
that
and
i
ca
cure
her
nurse
griffiths
declared
but
i
afraid
you
feeling
the
heat
and
you
are
not
very
strong
she
added
addressing
edith
who
was
clinging
to
the
porch
for
support
looking
strangely
haggard
wo
you
come
in
and
sit
down
a
bit
no
thank
you
it
is
nothing
edith
answered
steadily
recovering
herself
will
you
come
and
sit
down
with
me
on
that
seat
she
said
to
louise
indicating
a
rustic
bench
under
an
old
pear
tree
at
the
end
of
the
garden
i
want
to
talk
to
you
nurse
griffiths
and
angelica
remained
in
the
porch
who
is
that
lady
miss
the
nurse
asked
when
edith
was
out
of
hearing
lady
menteith
angelica
answered
the
woman
threw
up
her
hands
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
her
and
upon
us
what
a
cruel
cruel
shame
she
showing
her
the
letter
eh
it
enough
to
kill
her
you
generally
know
all
the
mischief
that
going
miss
why
did
you
bring
her
here
i
wish
i
had
known
this
then
said
angelica
whose
heart
was
thumping
painfully
if
any
harm
comes
of
it
i
shall
always
think
it
was
my
fault
well
there
no
call
to
do
that
if
you
did
know
the
woman
answered
i
see
she
was
a
great
lady
myself
but
i
never
thought
it
was
eh
but
it
the
dirty
men
makes
the
misery
on
the
way
back
edith
stopped
the
carriage
at
the
telegraph
office
and
despatched
a
message
to
her
husband
to
come
to
her
come
at
once
they
only
arrived
in
time
to
dress
hurriedly
for
dinner
and
when
they
went
down
to
the
drawing
room
they
found
galbraith
there
with
the
bishop
and
beale
where
have
you
two
been
the
whole
afternoon
the
latter
asked
we
had
tea
in
the
library
at
fountain
towers
angelica
answered
easily
and
obtained
some
useful
knowledge
from
your
books
galbraith
looked
hard
at
her
i
wonder
what
devilment
you
been
up
to
now
he
thought
but
angelica
manner
was
as
unconcerned
as
possible
edith
was
not
however
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
unnaturally
glittering
and
she
became
excited
about
trifles
and
talked
loudly
at
table
and
in
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
she
could
not
keep
still
beale
asked
angelica
to
play
and
angelica
tried
something
soothing
at
first
but
edith
complained
impatiently
that
those
things
always
made
her
melancholy
then
angelica
played
some
bars
of
patriotic
music
stirring
in
the
extreme
but
edith
stopped
her
again
that
wearies
my
brain
she
said
and
began
to
pace
about
the
room
up
and
down
up
and
down
her
mother
watched
her
anxiously
angelica
closed
the
piano
galbraith
and
the
bishop
came
in
from
the
dining
room
and
then
edith
declared
that
driving
in
the
open
air
had
made
her
so
sleepy
she
must
go
to
bed
angelica
noticed
that
galbraith
scrutinized
her
face
sharply
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
god
bless
you
my
dear
child
the
bishop
said
when
she
kissed
him
and
his
lips
moved
afterward
for
some
seconds
as
if
he
were
in
prayer
her
mother
followed
her
out
of
the
room
and
then
silence
settled
on
the
three
who
were
left
the
bishop
was
obviously
uneasy
plainness
was
softened
by
a
serious
expression
which
added
much
to
the
attractiveness
of
his
strong
kind
face
angelica
shivered
and
was
about
to
break
the
spell
of
silence
boldly
in
her
energetic
way
when
suddenly
and
apparently
overhead
a
heavy
bell
tolled
once
it
was
only
the
cathedral
clock
striking
the
hour
but
it
sounded
portentously
through
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
night
and
with
quickened
attention
they
all
looked
up
and
listened
slowly
the
big
bell
boomed
forth
ten
strokes
then
came
a
pause
and
then
the
chime
rolled
through
the
room
a
deafening
volume
of
sound
in
long
reverberations
from
amidst
which
the
constant
message
disentangled
itself
as
it
were
but
distinctly
although
to
each
listener
with
a
different
effect
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
it
awoke
galbraith
from
a
train
of
painful
reflections
it
reassured
the
bishop
and
it
made
angelica
fret
for
diavolo
remorsefully
chapter
viii
angelica
must
have
fallen
asleep
the
moment
she
got
into
bed
that
night
and
just
as
instantly
she
began
to
dream
she
had
never
hitherto
felt
a
throb
of
passion
she
had
given
the
best
love
of
her
life
to
her
brother
and
had
made
no
personal
application
of
anything
she
had
heard
or
seen
or
read
of
lovers
so
that
the
possibility
of
ever
having
one
of
her
own
had
never
cost
her
a
serious
thought
but
the
excitement
of
that
day
and
the
occupations
had
so
wrought
upon
her
imagination
that
when
she
slept
she
dreamt
and
in
her
dream
she
saw
a
semblance
the
semblance
of
a
man
a
changing
semblance
the
features
of
which
she
could
not
discern
although
she
tried
with
frenzied
effort
because
she
knew
that
when
she
saw
him
fully
face
to
face
he
would
be
hers
they
were
not
in
this
world
nor
in
the
next
they
were
not
eyen
in
the
universe
they
were
simply
each
the
centre
of
a
great
light
which
formed
a
sphere
about
them
and
separated
them
from
one
another
and
heaven
and
hell
and
earth
and
sky
and
night
and
day
and
life
and
death
were
all
added
to
the
glory
of
those
spheres
of
light
and
she
knew
but
there
is
no
word
of
human
speech
to
express
it
she
lay
on
light
she
stood
on
light
she
sat
on
light
she
swam
in
light
and
wallowed
and
walked
and
ran
and
leaped
and
soared
rolling
along
in
her
own
sphere
until
the
monotony
made
her
giddy
and
all
her
endeavour
was
to
reach
her
lover
not
for
himself
so
much
as
because
she
knew
that
if
their
two
lights
could
be
added
in
equal
parts
to
each
other
and
mingled
into
one
their
combined
effulgence
would
make
a
pathway
to
heaven
but
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
attain
her
object
and
finally
she
became
so
exhausted
by
the
struggle
that
she
was
obliged
to
desist
the
moment
she
did
so
however
the
other
sphere
tamed
of
its
own
accord
and
rolled
up
to
her
dear
me
said
angelica
how
easily
things
are
done
when
the
right
time
comes
the
semblance
now
took
shape
and
kissed
her
how
nice
thought
angelica
returning
the
kiss
this
is
love
love
is
life
i
am
his
he
is
mine
most
of
all
he
is
no
we
ca
allow
that
said
a
chorus
of
men
from
the
earth
you
beginning
to
know
too
much
you
want
to
be
paid
for
your
labour
next
just
as
well
as
we
are
and
that
is
but
angelica
only
laughed
and
kissed
her
lover
talk
does
no
good
she
said
this
is
the
one
thing
the
great
understands
at
present
so
she
kissed
him
again
and
every
time
she
kissed
him
he
changed
he
was
samson
abraham
lot
antony
caesar
pan
achilles
hercules
jove
he
was
lancelot
and
arthur
percival
galahad
and
gawaine
he
was
henry
richelieu
robespierre
luther
and
several
popes
he
was
david
the
psalmist
beloved
of
the
of
the
hebrews
he
was
absalom
and
paul
in
his
unregenerate
days
but
he
never
was
solomon
she
saw
hundreds
of
women
dividing
solomon
among
them
and
cherishing
the
little
bits
in
the
woman
sphere
of
their
day
and
they
offered
her
a
portion
but
she
refused
to
take
it
she
said
she
would
have
the
whole
of
him
or
none
at
all
and
they
were
horribly
shocked
they
said
fie
you
are
no
true
woman
a
woman
is
satisfied
with
very
little
and
silently
submits
but
angelica
answered
rubbish
what
do
you
know
of
womanhood
and
truth
you
talk
like
a
bishop
and
the
clergy
were
dreadfully
offended
at
this
they
said
she
was
all
wrong
they
said
it
mildly
they
shouted
it
rudely
they
whispered
it
persuasively
and
then
they
blustered
we
are
right
and
you
are
wrong
they
maintained
well
i
have
only
your
word
for
that
said
angelica
which
provoked
them
again
we
speak
in
the
name
of
the
lord
they
answered
oh
anybody
could
do
that
said
angelica
but
it
would
prove
that
they
have
the
lord
permission
to
use
his
name
then
they
reminded
her
that
the
true
spirit
of
god
had
been
bestowed
upon
them
for
transmission
and
she
answered
yes
but
it
was
taken
from
you
again
for
your
sins
and
confided
to
us
and
wherever
a
virtuous
woman
is
there
is
the
spirit
of
god
and
the
will
of
god
and
there
only
then
they
drew
off
a
little
and
consulted
and
when
they
spoke
again
they
had
lowered
their
tone
considerably
but
you
will
allow
i
suppose
that
we
have
done
some
good
in
the
world
they
said
collectively
oh
yes
she
answered
you
have
done
your
duty
here
and
there
to
the
best
of
your
ability
but
your
ability
was
considerably
impaired
by
vice
however
you
have
brought
the
world
up
out
of
the
dark
ages
of
physical
force
at
our
instigation
and
helped
to
prepare
it
for
us
now
step
down
gracefully
take
your
pensions
and
perquisites
and
hold
your
tongues
men
are
the
muscle
the
hard
working
material
of
the
nation
women
are
the
soul
and
spirit
the
directing
intelligence
they
were
about
to
reply
but
before
they
could
do
so
a
stentorian
voice
proclaimed
home
is
the
woman
sphere
who
are
you
said
angelica
coolly
i
am
the
pope
of
rome
he
answered
strutting
up
to
her
with
dignity
and
what
do
know
about
the
woman
sphere
she
said
laughing
i
am
informed
of
god
he
declared
but
she
answered
that
she
had
much
later
information
and
slammed
the
doors
of
the
sphere
in
his
face
then
she
peeped
through
the
keyhole
and
saw
that
the
pope
was
in
consultation
with
the
archbishops
of
canterbury
and
york
and
two
popular
cardinals
they
were
very
quiet
at
first
but
presently
they
began
to
quarrel
do
make
such
a
noise
she
shrieked
through
the
keyhole
go
away
and
be
good
will
you
we
very
busy
in
here
and
you
disturb
us
we
revising
the
moral
laws
the
shock
of
this
intelligence
electrified
them
and
while
they
stared
at
each
other
helplessly
not
knowing
what
to
do
she
armed
herself
with
the
vulgar
vernacular
which
was
the
best
weapon
she
understood
to
level
at
cant
lord
she
said
to
herself
how
diavolo
would
enjoy
this
i
wish
he
was
here
she
found
the
work
of
the
sphere
very
heavy
and
she
tried
to
remember
the
name
of
some
saint
but
for
the
life
of
her
she
think
of
any
so
she
called
upon
ouida
and
rhoda
broughton
then
she
peeped
through
the
keyhole
again
and
finding
that
the
pope
was
listening
she
squirted
water
into
his
ear
the
other
ecclesiastical
commissioners
remained
in
the
background
looking
anxious
we
attending
to
man
the
iniquitous
now
she
called
to
them
kindly
to
relieve
their
minds
been
too
much
for
you
it
seems
but
we
soon
settle
him
you
a
woman
said
the
pope
always
abusive
old
candles
and
vestments
angelica
retorted
candles
and
vestments
said
the
archbishop
of
york
hurriedly
where
and
he
went
off
to
see
about
them
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
a
powerful
voice
proclaimed
at
that
moment
ah
that
is
st
paul
said
angelica
surprised
and
delighted
and
then
she
shook
hands
with
him
the
sacred
duties
of
wife
and
mother
one
of
the
cardinals
began
to
pipe
there
you
are
meddling
again
angelica
interrupted
him
rudely
will
you
go
away
and
let
us
mind
our
own
business
this
is
all
your
fault
the
pope
said
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
archbishop
defended
himself
courteously
but
another
quarrel
seemed
inevitable
nevertheless
before
it
could
come
off
however
it
suddenly
appeared
that
if
it
were
anything
it
was
unwomanly
about
that
they
were
quite
in
accord
and
having
made
the
discovery
they
went
their
several
ways
shaking
their
several
heads
impressively
now
i
shall
have
time
to
consider
the
state
of
the
sphere
said
angelica
just
wait
till
i
can
come
and
teach
you
your
duty
she
called
to
the
women
there
i
am
not
esther
most
decidedly
but
i
am
judith
i
am
jael
i
am
vashti
i
am
godiva
i
am
all
the
heroic
women
of
all
the
ages
rolled
into
one
not
for
the
shedding
of
blood
but
for
the
saving
of
suffering
they
did
not
understand
her
a
bit
however
they
were
so
dazed
and
they
all
looked
askance
at
her
i
see
she
said
i
shall
have
to
save
you
in
spite
of
yourselves
but
when
she
had
looked
a
little
longer
and
seen
men
women
and
children
crowding
like
loathsome
maggots
together
she
was
disheartened
all
this
filth
will
breed
a
pestilence
she
said
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
pestilence
were
me
but
just
at
that
moment
the
light
went
out
someone
uttered
a
cry
and
angelica
awoke
the
room
was
flooded
with
moonlight
i
am
awake
now
she
said
to
herself
and
that
was
a
real
cry
it
was
i
think
and
she
rose
intrepidly
to
rush
to
the
rescue
she
was
going
off
at
once
just
as
she
was
in
her
nightdress
but
the
house
was
so
still
at
the
moment
that
she
thought
she
might
be
mistaken
she
was
determined
to
go
and
see
for
herself
however
in
order
to
make
sure
and
having
pinned
up
her
hair
she
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
dressing
gown
and
opened
the
door
her
heart
beating
wildly
all
the
time
it
was
a
sickening
sensation
but
as
she
listened
she
became
aware
of
voices
speaking
naturally
and
people
moving
to
and
fro
which
somewhat
reassured
her
she
left
the
room
however
and
ran
down
the
corridor
at
the
farther
end
a
bright
shaft
of
light
streamed
across
it
from
a
door
and
she
heard
edith
speaking
wildly
my
poor
child
my
poor
child
beale
answered
with
tears
in
her
voice
do
try
and
calm
yourself
wo
you
tell
us
this
story
that
is
troubling
you
now
you
will
feel
better
if
you
tell
us
no
no
edith
answered
quickly
i
will
not
tell
you
until
he
comes
any
of
you
but
he
comes
there
was
a
pause
then
she
asked
feebly
doctor
what
is
the
matter
with
my
head
but
before
he
could
answer
she
broke
out
into
a
stream
of
horrid
imprecations
angelica
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
flew
back
past
her
own
room
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
there
she
encountered
the
bishop
he
was
trembling
he
was
at
a
loss
nothing
he
had
ever
studied
either
in
theology
or
metaphysics
had
in
the
slightest
degree
prepared
him
for
the
state
of
things
in
society
which
he
was
now
being
forced
to
consider
my
dear
child
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
here
oh
i
frightened
i
frightened
angelica
cried
thumping
him
hard
on
the
chest
with
both
fists
let
us
go
away
and
hide
ourselves
she
seized
his
hand
impetuously
and
dragged
him
downstairs
after
her
sideways
a
mode
of
descent
which
was
more
rapid
than
either
safe
or
graceful
for
a
little
fat
bishop
in
evening
dress
come
come
come
to
the
library
with
me
and
talk
about
god
and
good
angels
and
that
kind
of
thing
she
cried
but
this
is
the
middle
of
the
night
the
bishop
objected
well
and
is
there
any
time
like
the
present
angelica
exclaimed
come
at
once
come
and
say
nice
soothing
things
from
the
psalms
as
she
spoke
she
dragged
him
across
the
hall
and
into
the
library
from
whence
he
had
just
issued
and
then
slammed
the
door
the
bishop
reproved
her
for
this
and
wanted
her
to
go
to
bed
but
she
refused
go
to
bed
and
lie
awake
in
the
dark
with
horrid
words
about
how
can
you
expect
it
she
demanded
i
shall
not
go
to
bed
unless
you
come
and
sit
beside
me
all
night
long
poor
angelica
impetuous
imperious
but
in
that
she
was
her
daughter
not
saved
by
her
wonderful
intelligence
from
being
fantastical
there
must
inevitably
have
been
an
element
of
broad
farce
in
the
veriest
tragedy
into
which
she
might
have
been
brought
at
that
time
an
element
which
was
rendered
all
the
more
conspicuous
by
her
own
inability
to
perceive
at
the
moment
that
she
was
behaving
ridiculously
and
making
others
ridiculous
but
the
bishop
himself
was
not
conscious
of
any
absurdity
or
loss
of
dignity
it
was
only
the
inconvenience
that
he
felt
just
then
for
he
was
fresh
from
a
painful
interview
with
galbraith
and
every
nerve
was
jarring
in
response
to
the
horror
that
had
come
upon
him
his
heart
was
wrung
and
his
conscience
did
not
acquit
him
he
did
recognize
now
however
that
angelica
was
in
no
fit
state
of
mind
to
be
left
alone
and
sitting
down
beside
a
little
table
on
which
stood
his
constant
companion
and
friend
for
many
years
a
large
quarto
copy
of
the
bible
he
folded
his
hands
upon
it
seeming
to
pray
while
he
waited
patiently
until
she
should
have
calmed
herself
her
indignation
had
driven
her
to
seek
a
more
popular
form
of
relief
than
the
bishop
had
chosen
as
she
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
evident
agitation
every
now
and
then
stopping
short
to
wring
her
hands
when
terrible
thoughts
came
crowding
she
became
in
her
own
mind
exceedingly
abusive
she
revised
and
enlarged
her
reply
to
that
cardinal
who
had
piped
to
her
earlier
in
the
night
about
the
sacred
duties
of
wife
and
mother
what
do
know
about
sacred
duties
of
wife
and
mother
she
jeered
increasing
her
pace
as
her
passion
waxed
wait
until
you
a
wife
and
mother
yourself
and
then
perhaps
you
be
able
to
give
an
opinion
and
meanwhile
attend
to
your
own
duties
you
come
poking
your
nose
into
the
sphere
where
it
not
wanted
she
shook
her
fist
at
him
with
your
theories
she
exclaimed
you
meddling
priest
what
you
afraid
of
is
that
there
wo
be
slaves
enough
in
the
world
to
make
money
for
you
or
poor
enough
to
bear
witness
to
your
christian
charity
you
need
be
afraid
though
so
long
as
we
have
there
be
poverty
in
plenty
here
she
became
conscious
of
the
attitude
of
her
companion
the
bishop
blotted
out
the
cardinal
his
wrinkled
hands
meekly
folded
his
white
head
bowed
his
benign
face
expressive
of
intense
mental
suffering
heroically
borne
impressed
her
resignation
no
not
resignation
exactly
her
thoughts
ran
on
to
be
resigned
is
to
acquiesce
resistance
yes
to
resist
but
not
to
resist
with
rage
be
firm
but
be
gentle
she
sat
down
at
last
in
an
and
leaned
back
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
fast
asleep
when
she
awoke
the
room
was
empty
but
outside
she
heard
receding
footsteps
and
springing
up
with
characteristic
impetuosity
she
followed
after
to
see
for
herself
the
shutters
were
still
closed
in
the
library
and
the
lamps
were
burning
but
it
was
broad
daylight
in
the
hall
and
a
heavy
squall
of
rain
was
beating
against
the
windows
with
mournful
effect
angelica
saw
a
manservant
standing
beside
some
baggage
as
she
passed
and
wondered
who
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
overtook
galbraith
and
caught
his
arm
is
edith
better
she
exclaimed
galbraith
looked
down
at
her
clasped
both
her
hands
in
one
of
his
as
they
rested
on
his
arm
and
led
her
upstairs
before
they
reached
the
top
his
firm
cool
touch
had
steadied
her
nerves
and
calmed
her
this
is
your
room
i
think
he
said
stopping
when
they
reached
it
angelica
took
the
hint
and
went
in
but
she
did
not
shut
the
door
you
might
have
told
me
you
pig
and
then
perhaps
i
should
have
been
satisfied
she
reflected
standing
just
inside
her
room
holding
her
head
very
high
and
straining
her
ears
to
listen
she
heard
galbraith
go
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
then
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
ceased
she
knew
that
he
must
have
gone
into
edith
room
the
house
was
oppressively
still
i
suppose
i
am
to
be
tortured
with
suspense
because
i
am
young
she
thought
and
then
she
followed
galbraith
the
shutters
were
still
closed
in
edith
room
and
the
gas
was
burning
nobody
had
thought
of
letting
the
daylight
in
the
door
was
open
and
a
screen
was
drawn
across
it
but
angelica
could
see
past
the
screen
she
saw
edith
first
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
still
dressed
and
sensible
now
but
exhausted
her
yellow
hair
all
in
disorder
fell
over
the
pillow
to
one
side
and
on
the
same
side
her
mother
sat
facing
her
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
holding
edith
hand
which
she
patted
from
time
to
time
in
a
helpless
piteous
sort
of
way
edith
was
lying
on
her
back
with
her
face
turned
toward
angelica
there
were
deep
lines
of
suffering
marked
upon
it
and
her
eyes
glittered
feverishly
but
otherwise
she
was
gray
and
ghastly
and
old
it
was
the
horrible
look
of
age
that
impressed
angelica
there
were
three
gentlemen
present
the
bishop
galbraith
and
sir
mosley
menteith
edith
was
looking
at
her
father
that
is
why
i
sent
for
you
all
she
was
saying
feebly
to
tell
you
you
who
reprersent
the
arrangement
of
society
which
has
made
it
possible
for
me
and
my
child
to
be
sacrificed
in
this
way
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
any
of
you
except
she
sat
up
in
bed
suddenly
and
addressed
her
husband
in
scathing
tones
except
to
you
and
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
is
go
go
father
turn
him
out
of
the
house
do
let
me
ever
see
that
dreadful
man
again
she
fell
back
on
her
pillow
white
and
still
and
shut
her
eyes
my
darling
you
will
kill
yourself
her
mother
exclaimed
galbraith
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
bed
hurriedly
and
bent
over
her
the
bishop
stood
at
the
foot
holding
on
to
the
rail
with
both
hands
his
whole
face
quivering
with
suppressed
emotion
menteith
gave
them
a
vindictive
glance
and
then
stole
quietly
away
angelica
had
made
her
escape
and
was
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
wringing
her
hands
she
was
trembling
with
rage
and
excitement
i
am
jael
i
am
judith
no
i
am
cassandra
she
was
saying
to
herself
i
must
speak
i
wish
to
god
i
had
answered
that
telegram
so
promptly
coming
to
be
made
an
exhibition
of
by
a
sick
woman
in
her
tantrums
menteith
reflected
as
he
walked
down
the
corridor
i
surprised
at
edith
but
it
is
so
like
a
woman
you
never
can
count
upon
them
here
he
caught
sight
of
angelica
and
quite
started
with
interest
that
a
deuced
fine
girl
he
thought
and
followed
her
to
the
library
instinctively
a
servant
had
just
opened
the
shutters
angelica
went
to
one
of
the
windows
and
throwing
it
up
to
the
top
inhaled
a
deep
breath
of
the
fresh
morning
air
the
rain
had
stopped
the
servant
put
out
the
lamps
and
withdrew
after
standing
aside
for
a
moment
respectfully
to
allow
sir
mosley
menteith
to
enter
the
latter
glanced
round
the
room
but
angelica
was
hidden
by
the
curtain
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
the
window
menteith
bit
his
nails
and
stood
still
for
some
time
then
the
bishop
came
followed
by
galbraith
and
walked
straight
up
to
him
it
was
a
bad
moment
for
sir
mosley
menteith
he
tried
to
inspect
his
coolly
but
his
hand
was
somewhat
tremulous
as
he
raised
it
to
twist
the
ends
of
his
little
light
moustache
my
daughter
wishes
you
to
leave
the
house
the
bishop
said
sternly
and
eh
i
may
say
that
i
that
eh
her
father
and
mother
also
wish
you
to
go
eh
now
at
once
angelica
sprang
from
her
hiding
place
and
take
that
she
cried
for
a
present
you
father
of
a
speckled
toad
and
seizing
the
heavy
quarto
bible
from
the
table
she
flung
it
with
all
her
might
full
in
his
face
it
happened
to
hit
him
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
which
it
broke
chapter
ix
later
in
the
day
lord
dawne
who
had
ridden
in
saw
carriage
waiting
before
orton
beg
little
house
in
the
close
he
reined
in
his
horse
which
was
fidgety
and
at
the
same
moment
galbraith
came
out
nothing
wrong
here
i
hope
lord
dawne
inquired
no
was
the
curt
response
it
is
that
poor
child
at
the
palace
i
have
been
up
with
her
all
night
what
is
the
matter
now
lord
dawne
inquired
now
it
is
her
brain
the
doctor
answered
then
stepped
into
his
carriage
and
was
driven
away
lord
dawne
dismounted
and
met
orton
beg
who
was
coming
out
with
her
bonnet
on
no
hope
i
suppose
he
said
in
a
tone
of
deep
commiseration
oh
it
is
worse
than
death
she
answered
i
am
going
there
now
galbraith
says
i
shall
be
of
use
the
bishop
and
angelica
spent
some
time
in
the
library
together
that
morning
the
bishop
had
sent
for
angelica
to
talk
to
her
and
she
had
come
to
talk
to
the
bishop
and
being
quicker
of
speech
than
he
she
had
taken
the
initiative
did
you
ever
feel
like
a
horse
with
a
bearing
rein
champing
his
bit
she
began
the
moment
she
burst
into
the
room
no
i
never
did
said
the
bishop
severely
ah
then
i
can
never
make
you
understand
how
i
feel
now
she
said
throwing
herself
on
to
a
chair
opposite
to
him
sideways
so
that
she
could
clasp
the
back
you
look
very
unsympathetic
she
remarked
it
seems
to
me
the
bishop
began
with
increased
severity
that
you
have
no
respect
for
anybody
no
i
have
not
she
answered
decidedly
at
least
not
for
bishops
and
doctors
who
let
menteith
miscreants
loose
in
society
to
marry
whom
they
please
the
bishop
winced
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
reprove
you
seriously
he
recommenced
shaking
his
head
but
i
feel
that
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
if
i
neglected
to
point
out
to
you
the
extremely
reprehensible
nature
of
your
conduct
first
in
causing
grievous
distress
of
mind
to
edith
in
consequence
of
which
partly
she
is
now
lying
dangerously
ill
upstairs
angelica
stopped
him
by
suddenly
assuming
a
dignified
position
on
her
chair
she
looked
hard
at
him
and
as
she
did
so
great
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
ran
down
her
cheeks
if
i
have
done
edith
any
injury
she
exclaimed
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
well
well
said
the
bishop
kindly
but
do
you
think
i
was
so
much
to
blame
angelica
demanded
interrupting
him
i
only
did
what
you
and
beale
and
everybody
else
did
took
it
for
granted
that
she
had
married
a
decent
man
but
go
on
said
angelica
throwing
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
folding
her
arms
what
else
have
i
done
you
have
grievously
injured
a
oh
if
you
like
and
too
said
angelica
but
the
injury
i
did
him
was
a
piece
of
luck
for
which
i
expect
to
be
congratulated
you
took
the
sacred
word
of
god
the
bishop
began
because
of
the
weight
of
it
angelica
interrupted
again
figuratively
too
it
was
most
appropriate
i
call
it
poetical
justice
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
and
she
burst
into
a
sudden
squall
of
rage
if
you
nag
me
any
more
i
throw
bibles
about
until
there
is
a
whole
one
in
the
house
the
bishop
looked
at
her
steadily
i
shall
say
no
more
he
observed
very
gently
but
i
beg
of
you
to
reflect
then
he
opened
the
quarto
bible
and
began
to
read
to
himself
angelica
remained
sitting
opposite
to
him
looking
moodily
at
the
floor
but
now
and
then
they
stole
furtive
glances
at
each
other
and
every
time
the
bishop
looked
at
angelica
he
shook
his
head
things
have
gone
wrong
in
the
sphere
slipped
from
angelica
at
last
sphere
said
the
bishop
looking
up
what
sphere
woman
sphere
angelica
answered
solemnly
and
then
she
told
him
her
dream
it
took
her
exactly
an
hour
to
relate
it
with
such
comments
and
elucidations
as
she
deemed
necessary
and
the
bishop
heard
her
out
when
she
finished
he
was
somewhat
exhausted
but
he
said
that
he
thought
it
a
very
remarkable
dream
if
you
had
been
able
to
manage
the
sphere
you
see
angelica
concluded
and
to
regulate
the
extent
of
it
you
would
have
been
able
to
make
it
a
proper
place
for
us
to
live
in
by
this
time
my
dear
child
you
are
talking
nonsense
the
bishop
exclaimed
well
it
may
sound
so
to
you
at
present
angelica
answered
temperately
but
there
is
a
small
idea
in
my
mind
which
wo
be
nonsense
when
it
grows
up
she
was
silent
for
a
little
after
that
and
then
she
ejaculated
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
pestilence
were
me
eh
said
the
bishop
did
i
speak
said
angelica
yes
ah
then
that
is
because
i
am
tired
out
i
shall
go
to
bed
do
for
the
life
of
you
let
anybody
disturb
me
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
yawning
desperately
and
very
soon
afterward
her
aunts
came
to
take
her
back
to
morne
but
the
bishop
obeyed
her
last
injunction
implicitly
and
they
were
obliged
to
return
without
her
the
news
that
edith
had
returned
to
the
palace
bringing
her
little
son
for
the
first
time
was
soon
known
in
the
neighbourhood
the
arrival
of
the
boy
was
one
of
those
events
of
life
originally
destined
to
be
a
great
joy
which
soften
the
heart
and
make
it
tender
and
very
soon
carriages
came
rolling
up
with
ladies
leaning
forward
in
them
all
in
a
flutter
of
sympathy
and
interest
eager
to
offer
their
congratulations
to
the
young
mother
and
to
be
introduced
to
the
child
and
meanwhile
beale
sat
beside
her
daughter
bed
patting
her
slender
white
hand
from
time
to
time
as
it
lay
upon
the
coverlet
with
that
little
gesture
which
had
struck
angelica
as
being
so
piteous
edith
had
not
spoken
for
hours
but
suddenly
she
exclaimed
evadne
was
right
beale
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
and
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
slowly
trickled
down
her
cheeks
edith
darling
she
said
at
last
with
a
great
effort
do
you
blame
me
oh
no
mother
oh
no
edith
cried
pressing
her
hand
and
looking
at
her
with
a
last
flash
of
loving
recognition
the
same
thing
may
happen
now
to
any
mother
to
any
daughter
and
happen
so
long
as
we
refuse
to
know
and
resist
a
spasm
of
pain
contracted
her
face
she
pressed
her
mother
hand
again
gently
and
closed
her
eyes
presently
she
laughed
i
am
quite
quite
mad
she
said
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
doing
i
been
murdering
him
i
been
creeping
creeping
with
bare
feet
to
surprise
him
in
his
sleep
and
i
had
a
tiny
knife
very
sharp
and
i
felt
for
the
artery
she
touched
her
neck
and
then
stabbed
quickly
and
he
awoke
and
knew
he
must
die
and
cowered
and
it
was
all
a
pleasure
to
me
oh
yes
i
am
quite
quite
mad
she
did
not
notice
the
coming
and
going
of
people
now
or
anything
that
was
done
in
her
room
that
day
only
once
when
she
heard
a
servant
outside
the
door
whisper
for
her
ladyship
she
asked
what
it
was
and
a
silver
salver
was
brought
to
her
covered
with
visiting
cards
she
looked
at
one
or
two
kind
messages
she
said
great
names
and
i
am
a
great
lady
too
i
suppose
i
made
a
splendid
match
and
now
i
have
a
lovely
little
boy
the
one
thing
wanting
to
complete
my
happiness
what
numbers
of
girls
must
envy
me
ah
they
do
know
but
tell
them
tell
them
that
quite
quite
mad
beale
was
at
last
persuaded
to
go
and
rest
and
orton
beg
replaced
her
i
am
glad
you
have
come
said
edith
i
want
to
show
you
my
lovely
little
son
naturally
i
want
to
show
him
to
everyone
and
she
laughed
late
in
the
evening
when
the
room
was
lighted
up
edith
noticed
her
father
and
mother
and
galbraith
angelica
was
there
too
but
in
the
background
edith
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
shriek
starting
up
in
bed
i
want
to
kill
i
want
to
kill
i
want
to
kill
that
monstrous
child
galbraith
was
in
time
to
prevent
her
springing
out
of
bed
i
know
i
am
mad
she
moaned
in
a
broken
voice
i
am
quite
quite
mad
i
never
hurt
a
creature
in
my
life
never
thought
an
evil
thought
of
anyone
why
must
i
suffer
so
father
my
head
again
she
started
up
you
ca
you
save
me
she
shrieked
father
my
head
my
head
angelica
stole
away
to
her
own
room
put
on
her
things
and
walked
back
to
morne
alone
chapter
angelica
had
been
baptized
into
the
world
of
anguish
she
had
assisted
at
horrid
mysteries
of
life
and
death
and
the
experience
was
likely
to
be
warping
she
had
fled
from
the
palace
first
because
she
could
not
bear
the
place
any
longer
and
secondly
because
she
felt
imperatively
that
she
must
see
diavolo
he
had
been
in
bed
and
asleep
for
some
time
when
she
went
to
his
room
that
night
and
awoke
him
by
flashing
a
light
in
his
face
he
was
startled
at
first
but
when
he
saw
who
it
was
he
remembered
their
last
quarrel
and
the
base
way
she
had
deserted
him
by
going
to
stay
at
the
palace
and
he
thought
it
due
to
his
wounded
heart
to
snap
at
her
what
you
mean
by
disturbing
me
so
late
at
night
he
drawled
plaintively
bringing
in
such
a
beastly
lot
of
fresh
air
with
you
too
you
make
me
shiver
do
be
a
fool
diavolo
angelica
answered
you
know
you
delighted
to
see
me
how
nice
you
look
with
your
hair
all
tousled
i
wish
my
hair
was
fair
like
yours
oh
i
have
such
a
lot
to
tell
you
get
on
then
he
said
lying
back
on
his
broad
white
pillows
resignedly
or
go
away
and
keep
your
confidences
till
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
kindly
consult
my
inclinations
that
is
what
i
should
ask
he
added
politely
angelica
curled
herself
up
on
the
end
of
his
bed
and
leant
against
the
the
room
was
large
and
lofty
and
the
only
light
in
it
was
that
of
the
candle
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
she
had
a
walking
jacket
on
over
an
evening
dress
and
a
hat
but
this
she
took
off
and
threw
on
the
floor
i
run
away
she
said
i
walked
home
all
alone
what
up
all
that
long
dark
hill
he
exclaimed
with
interest
but
without
incredulity
the
heavenly
twins
never
lied
to
each
other
yes
she
answered
impressively
and
i
cut
across
the
pine
woods
and
the
big
black
shadows
fluttered
about
me
like
butterfly
bogies
and
i
was
afraid
i
threw
my
arms
about
and
ran
and
jumped
and
oh
she
exclaimed
after
holding
your
breath
for
hours
in
a
house
full
of
gaslight
and
groans
you
learn
what
it
is
to
be
able
to
breathe
freely
out
under
the
stars
in
the
blessed
dark
and
there
was
a
little
crescent
moon
above
the
trees
she
added
diavolo
had
opened
his
great
gray
eyes
and
looked
out
over
her
head
through
the
wall
opposite
watching
her
with
enthusiasm
as
she
cut
across
the
pine
woods
and
how
did
you
get
in
he
asked
at
the
back
she
answered
they
looked
into
each
other
intelligent
faces
and
grinned
everybody
is
in
bed
she
added
and
i
half
inclined
to
return
to
the
palace
and
come
back
in
the
carriage
properly
i
should
do
that
said
diavolo
feeling
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
an
inartistic
anticlimax
and
it
now
i
should
think
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
peered
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
angelica
held
up
the
candle
it
two
she
said
what
do
you
do
when
you
first
wake
up
in
the
morning
turn
round
and
go
to
sleep
again
diavolo
grunted
always
look
at
the
clock
said
angelica
but
i
want
to
tell
you
you
know
after
you
said
i
was
a
cyclone
in
petticoats
diavolo
nodded
so
you
are
he
remarked
well
i
then
angelica
retorted
have
it
so
only
interrupt
me
i
ca
think
why
i
cared
she
added
upon
reflection
it
seems
so
little
now
and
such
a
long
way
off
is
it
as
far
from
the
point
as
you
are
diavolo
courteously
inquired
ah
i
coming
to
that
she
resumed
and
then
she
graphically
recounted
her
late
painful
experiences
including
the
bishop
charge
to
sir
mosley
menteith
and
poor
edith
last
piteous
appeal
to
heaven
and
earth
for
the
relief
which
she
was
not
to
receive
and
did
she
die
diavolo
asked
in
an
awestruck
whisper
being
less
sturdy
and
more
sensitive
than
angelica
he
was
quite
shaken
by
the
bare
recital
of
such
suffering
not
while
i
was
there
angelica
answered
i
heard
her
as
i
came
out
she
was
calling
on
god
then
they
were
both
silent
for
some
moments
after
this
angelica
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
candle
and
diavolo
looked
up
to
the
unanswering
heaven
full
of
the
vague
wonderment
which
asks
why
why
why
there
is
no
law
you
see
angelica
resumed
either
to
protect
us
or
avenge
us
that
is
because
men
made
the
law
for
themselves
and
that
is
why
women
are
fighting
for
the
right
to
make
laws
too
i
help
them
diavolo
exclaimed
will
you
said
angelica
that
right
shake
hands
having
solemnly
ratified
the
compact
angelica
boldly
asserted
that
all
the
manly
men
were
helping
women
now
including
uncle
dawne
and
galbraith
then
she
thought
she
would
go
to
bed
of
course
she
had
flung
the
door
wide
open
when
she
entered
and
left
it
so
and
happening
to
glance
toward
it
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
horrible
peculiar
kind
of
pitchy
black
darkness
streaming
in
o
diavolo
she
exclaimed
i
frightened
i
dare
go
alone
frightened
he
jeered
after
dancing
home
alone
in
tip
dark
through
the
pine
woods
too
there
were
only
birds
beasts
and
bogies
there
pleasant
creatures
she
said
but
here
behind
those
rows
and
rows
of
closed
doors
there
will
be
ghosts
of
tortured
women
and
i
shall
hear
them
shriek
her
terror
communicated
itself
to
diavolo
quick
imagination
and
he
glanced
toward
the
door
apprehensively
then
he
deliberately
arose
put
on
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
lit
a
candle
by
which
time
his
face
was
steadily
set
come
he
said
i
see
you
safely
to
your
room
diavolo
you
a
real
gentleman
angelica
protested
for
i
know
in
as
big
a
fright
as
i
am
diavolo
drew
himself
up
and
led
the
way
their
rooms
were
far
apart
it
having
been
deemed
advisable
to
separate
them
when
they
first
came
to
the
castle
at
which
time
there
had
been
a
curious
delusion
that
distance
would
do
this
the
first
part
of
their
progress
that
night
was
nervous
work
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
the
new
aspect
which
familiar
things
took
on
by
the
light
of
their
candles
arrested
their
attention
the
light
makes
wink
said
angelica
looking
up
at
a
portrait
and
venus
has
put
on
a
cloak
she
in
said
diavolo
poetically
they
were
talking
quite
unconcernedly
by
this
time
and
in
their
usual
somewhat
loud
tone
of
voice
fear
of
discovery
not
being
one
of
their
characteristics
they
were
bound
to
have
awakened
any
light
sleeper
but
it
so
happened
that
they
passed
no
occupied
rooms
but
their
uncle
dawne
he
however
being
up
heard
them
and
opened
his
door
on
them
suddenly
they
both
jumped
what
are
you
two
doing
he
said
and
why
are
you
here
at
all
angelica
i
did
think
it
delicate
to
stay
at
the
palace
any
longer
under
the
circumstances
she
answered
glibly
lord
dawne
was
struck
by
the
extreme
propriety
of
this
reply
and
may
i
ask
you
returned
he
said
yesterday
she
answered
and
i
had
nothing
to
eat
since
oh
he
observed
and
you
not
had
time
to
remove
your
walking
jacket
either
he
looked
hard
at
her
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
how
you
got
in
he
said
shaking
his
head
the
heavenly
twins
looked
at
him
affably
well
he
concluded
knowing
better
than
to
question
them
i
suppose
you
know
where
to
find
food
if
that
is
your
object
they
both
grinned
come
along
uncle
dawne
and
we
show
you
angelica
burst
out
sociably
yes
diavolo
entreated
come
and
revel
the
heavenly
twins
never
worked
on
any
regular
plan
their
ideas
always
came
to
them
as
they
went
on
lord
dawne
felt
that
this
was
really
claiming
a
kinship
with
him
and
a
picture
which
presented
itself
to
his
mind
eye
of
himself
foraging
for
food
in
his
father
castle
with
the
heavenly
twins
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
appealed
to
him
it
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
lost
very
well
he
said
putting
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
the
short
velvet
jacket
he
was
wearing
and
preparing
to
follow
the
twins
led
the
way
holding
their
candles
aloft
and
descending
the
stairs
in
step
but
exactly
what
the
mysteries
were
into
which
they
initiated
their
uncle
that
night
nobody
knows
only
they
were
all
very
late
for
breakfast
next
morning
and
when
lord
dawne
saw
his
sisters
he
listened
in
silence
to
such
explanations
of
angelica
reappearance
at
the
castle
as
they
were
able
to
offer
angelica
herself
forgot
she
was
not
at
home
and
came
down
to
breakfast
yawning
unconcernedly
the
exclamation
of
surprise
with
which
she
was
greeted
took
her
aback
at
first
she
had
intended
to
send
a
carriage
early
in
the
morning
for
her
maid
elizabeth
and
to
walk
in
herself
with
her
hat
on
when
it
returned
as
if
she
had
come
in
it
but
as
she
only
remembered
this
intention
when
lady
fulda
exclaimed
why
angelica
how
did
you
come
she
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
simple
truth
and
after
answering
blandly
i
walked
auntie
she
left
the
matter
there
for
others
to
elucidate
at
their
leisure
if
they
chose
to
make
inquiries
but
the
accustomed
trouble
with
the
heavenly
twins
seemed
insignificant
at
this
time
compared
with
other
perplexities
which
were
pending
at
the
castle
the
old
duke
had
been
very
queer
lately
he
had
been
dreaming
and
seeing
things
as
diavolo
explained
to
angelica
storms
and
what
dreams
ye
holy
gods
what
dreams
father
ricardo
said
they
were
miraculous
temptations
of
the
devil
the
implication
being
that
the
poor
old
duke
soul
was
more
specially
worth
wrangling
for
than
those
of
less
exalted
sinners
the
one
dear
wish
of
father
ricardo
life
was
to
be
mixed
up
in
something
miraculous
he
was
too
humble
to
expect
anything
to
be
revealed
to
himself
personally
but
he
had
great
hopes
of
the
saintly
lady
fulda
and
certainly
if
concessions
are
to
be
wrung
from
the
infinite
to
the
finite
by
perfect
holiness
of
life
and
mind
she
should
have
obtained
some
she
had
become
deeply
read
in
that
kind
of
lore
under
father
ricardo
direction
and
had
meditated
so
much
about
occurrences
of
the
kind
that
it
would
not
have
surprised
her
if
she
had
met
our
lady
anywhere
bright
light
blue
cloak
supernatural
beauty
indefinite
draperies
lilies
sacred
heart
and
all
she
had
in
fact
thought
too
much
about
it
and
was
becoming
somewhat
hysterical
which
raised
father
ricardo
hopes
for
he
was
not
a
scientific
man
and
knew
nothing
of
the
natural
history
of
the
human
being
and
of
hysteria
and
besides
by
dint
of
long
watching
fasting
and
otherwise
outraging
what
he
believed
to
have
been
created
in
the
image
of
god
his
own
poor
body
and
also
by
the
feverish
fervour
with
which
he
entreated
heaven
to
vouchsafe
them
a
revelation
at
morne
for
the
benefit
of
holy
church
he
was
worn
to
a
shadow
and
had
become
somewhat
hysterical
himself
the
twins
had
discovered
him
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
in
the
chapel
at
night
and
had
been
much
interested
in
the
vain
repetitions
and
other
audible
ejaculations
which
he
was
offering
up
with
many
contortions
of
his
attenuated
form
is
he
enjoying
himself
diavolo
whispered
he
must
be
in
training
to
wrestle
with
the
devil
when
they
meet
angelica
surmised
but
all
this
was
having
a
bad
effect
upon
the
old
duke
in
private
he
and
lady
fulda
and
the
priest
talked
of
nothing
but
apparitions
and
supernatural
occurrences
generally
lord
dawne
had
obtained
a
hint
of
what
was
going
on
from
some
chance
observations
of
the
heavenly
twins
but
until
the
day
after
angelica
return
from
the
palace
neither
his
father
nor
sister
had
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
that
morning
however
he
happened
to
go
into
the
chapel
to
see
how
the
colours
were
lasting
in
some
decorative
work
which
he
had
done
there
himself
years
before
and
there
he
found
his
father
standing
in
the
aisle
to
the
right
of
the
altar
near
the
door
of
the
sacristy
gazing
up
fixedly
at
a
particular
panel
in
the
dark
oakwork
which
covered
that
portion
of
the
wall
anything
wrong
father
he
said
going
up
to
him
dawne
the
old
duke
replied
in
an
undertone
touching
his
son
arm
with
the
point
of
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
and
pointing
up
to
the
panel
with
the
stick
he
held
in
his
right
dawne
if
it
were
not
for
what
that
panel
conceals
he
ended
by
folding
his
hands
on
the
top
of
his
stick
looking
down
at
the
pavement
and
shaking
his
head
i
saw
it
in
a
dream
first
he
resumed
looking
up
at
the
panel
but
now
it
appears
during
every
service
it
comes
out
it
stretches
its
baby
hands
to
me
it
sobs
it
sighs
it
begs
it
prays
and
sometimes
it
smiles
and
then
there
are
dimples
about
its
innocent
mouth
some
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
caused
lord
dawne
to
look
round
at
this
moment
although
he
had
heard
nothing
and
he
was
startled
to
find
his
sister
fulda
standing
behind
him
looking
as
awestruck
as
the
duke
we
must
tear
down
that
panel
the
old
man
exclaimed
becoming
excited
we
must
exorcise
and
purify
and
cleanse
the
house
it
is
that
that
shaking
his
stick
at
the
panel
which
hinders
the
event
bury
it
deep
bury
it
deep
give
it
the
holy
rites
and
his
voice
dropped
he
muttered
something
inaudible
and
walked
feebly
down
the
aisle
lady
fulda
followed
him
out
of
the
chapel
but
presently
she
returned
her
brother
was
still
standing
as
she
had
left
him
looking
now
at
the
pavement
and
now
at
the
panel
and
deep
in
thought
his
grave
face
lighted
with
tenderness
as
he
turned
to
meet
her
she
was
very
pale
i
am
afraid
all
this
is
too
much
for
you
fulda
he
said
seriously
no
this
is
nothing
she
answered
nothing
no
excitement
ever
disturbs
me
but
dawne
i
have
seen
myself
it
what
fulda
the
child
just
as
he
describes
it
it
appears
there
looking
up
at
the
panel
and
stretches
out
its
little
hands
to
me
smiling
but
when
i
move
to
take
it
it
is
gone
my
dear
fulda
lord
dawne
replied
with
a
shiver
which
he
attributed
to
the
chill
of
the
chapel
people
who
live
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
you
do
are
liable
to
things
it
would
ease
my
mind
she
said
clasping
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
and
laying
her
cheek
upon
them
it
would
ease
my
mind
if
that
panel
were
removed
there
is
something
behind
it
it
must
be
solid
masonry
then
he
answered
smiling
and
stepping
up
to
the
panel
he
tapped
it
hard
with
his
knuckles
but
contrary
to
his
expectations
the
sound
it
emitted
was
somewhat
hollow
then
he
examined
it
carefully
and
discovered
that
it
was
not
fitted
into
grooves
as
the
other
panels
were
but
was
held
in
its
place
by
four
screws
the
heads
of
which
had
been
carefully
concealed
by
putty
stained
and
varnished
to
the
color
of
the
oak
i
will
see
about
this
at
once
he
said
the
message
from
the
palace
that
morning
sent
by
orton
beg
had
been
edith
still
lingers
and
lord
dawne
had
intended
to
go
there
to
see
the
bishop
in
times
of
sickness
and
sorrow
he
was
everywhere
welcome
but
now
he
went
with
the
further
intention
of
finding
galbraith
in
this
he
was
successful
and
they
had
a
long
talk
about
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
castle
and
it
was
finally
arranged
that
galbraith
should
dine
there
that
evening
and
remain
for
the
night
that
panel
must
be
removed
he
said
and
it
should
be
done
with
great
ceremony
the
best
time
would
be
midnight
but
leave
all
that
to
father
ricardo
and
only
insist
upon
one
thing
and
that
is
the
presence
of
the
heavenly
twins
are
you
meditating
a
de
theâtre
no
not
at
all
galbraith
replied
only
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
there
is
any
exorcism
to
be
done
the
heavenly
twins
will
accomplish
it
better
than
any
priest
lord
dawne
however
remained
somewhat
uncertain
about
the
wisdom
of
this
recommendation
but
as
galbraith
had
always
managed
his
foibles
and
other
difficult
matters
at
the
castle
with
admirable
tact
and
delicacy
he
gave
in
the
twins
themselves
soon
perceived
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
during
the
day
several
strange
priests
arrived
all
looking
more
or
less
important
but
they
did
not
dine
with
the
duke
the
demeanour
of
the
latter
was
portentously
solemn
diavolo
tried
to
take
him
out
of
himself
but
was
reproved
for
his
levity
and
father
ricardo
and
lady
fulda
went
about
with
exalted
expressions
of
countenance
and
looking
greatly
in
need
of
food
and
rest
even
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
nobody
talked
much
and
as
the
hours
dragged
on
slowly
toward
midnight
the
silence
in
the
castle
became
oppressive
the
servants
stole
about
on
tiptoe
and
in
pairs
being
nervous
about
going
into
the
big
empty
rooms
and
down
the
long
shadowy
corridors
alone
there
was
besides
a
general
inclination
to
glance
about
furtively
as
the
hush
of
anxious
expectancy
settled
upon
everybody
the
twins
felt
it
themselves
but
they
were
everywhere
all
the
same
and
if
any
particular
preparations
had
been
made
it
would
have
been
at
the
risk
of
their
discovering
them
the
night
was
sultry
and
very
dark
galbraith
and
lord
dawne
stood
together
stirring
their
coffee
at
an
open
window
in
the
great
drawing
room
it
is
curiously
still
said
lord
dawne
looking
out
it
reminds
me
of
the
legend
of
nature
waiting
breathless
for
the
happy
release
of
an
imprisoned
soul
i
wonder
how
that
poor
child
edith
is
i
would
give
i
would
give
anything
that
anybody
could
name
galbraith
said
slowly
to
be
quite
sure
that
she
would
pass
into
peace
ah
poor
girl
poor
innocent
girl
lord
dawne
ejaculated
and
then
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
how
long
o
lord
how
long
we
are
so
powerless
we
accomplish
so
little
the
great
sum
of
suffering
never
seems
lessened
do
what
we
will
they
were
silent
for
some
time
after
that
each
occupied
with
painful
thoughts
and
then
galbraith
spoke
with
an
effort
to
change
the
direction
of
them
a
storm
would
be
most
opportune
he
said
but
things
of
that
kind
never
do
happen
opportunely
lord
dawne
rejoined
just
as
he
spoke
however
a
brilliant
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
vividly
the
precipitous
side
of
the
hill
and
the
whole
valley
beneath
them
for
a
moment
let
us
hope
it
is
a
happy
omen
said
galbraith
toward
midnight
the
various
members
of
the
household
who
were
privileged
to
be
present
at
the
coming
ceremony
began
to
assemble
in
the
chapel
but
the
very
first
to
arrive
found
that
the
heavenly
twins
were
before
them
and
had
secured
the
best
seats
for
seeing
and
hearing
the
chapel
was
dim
and
even
dark
at
the
corners
and
at
the
farther
end
there
being
no
light
except
from
the
candles
which
were
burning
upon
the
altar
four
priests
were
kneeling
before
it
at
the
rails
and
a
fifth
came
out
of
the
sacristy
presently
and
passed
in
it
was
father
ricardo
and
as
he
made
the
genuflection
it
was
seen
that
his
face
was
irradiated
by
profound
emotion
he
remained
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
for
some
moments
then
he
arose
and
at
the
same
instant
the
chapel
glowed
in
every
colour
of
the
prism
it
was
merely
the
play
of
the
lightning
through
the
stained
glass
windows
but
the
unexpected
effect
combined
with
the
electricity
in
the
atmosphere
and
the
tension
of
expectancy
wrought
upon
the
nerves
of
all
present
the
heavenly
twins
snuggled
up
close
to
each
other
lady
fulda
lips
began
to
move
rapidly
in
fervent
prayer
angelica
noticed
this
and
as
she
watched
her
aunt
her
own
lips
began
to
move
in
imitation
either
involuntarily
or
in
order
to
see
if
she
could
work
them
as
fast
but
now
the
attention
of
all
present
became
riveted
upon
the
priests
father
ricardo
descended
the
altar
steps
and
two
of
the
others
followed
him
into
the
sacristy
they
returned
in
the
same
order
but
father
ricardo
was
carrying
a
basin
of
holy
water
and
an
aspergillus
with
which
he
proceeded
to
sprinkle
all
present
murmuring
some
inaudible
adjuration
the
while
one
of
the
strange
priests
held
an
open
book
and
the
other
carried
some
common
carpenter
tools
during
this
interval
the
lightning
flashed
again
and
was
seen
to
play
about
the
chapel
in
fantastic
figures
before
the
black
darkness
engulfed
it
a
long
irregular
roll
of
distant
thunder
succeeded
and
then
after
a
perceptible
pause
there
was
a
sound
as
of
hundreds
of
little
feet
pattering
upon
the
roof
they
were
the
advanced
guard
of
rain
drops
heralding
the
approaching
storm
and
halted
instantly
while
the
air
in
the
chapel
became
perceptibly
colder
and
galbraith
himself
began
to
experience
sensations
which
made
him
fear
it
would
have
been
wiser
if
a
less
appropriate
time
had
been
chosen
to
lay
the
ghost
the
priest
now
approached
the
panel
upon
one
corner
of
which
a
ray
of
light
from
the
altar
fell
obliquely
father
ricardo
sprinkled
it
liberally
from
where
he
stood
on
the
ground
repeating
some
formula
as
he
did
so
and
then
mounted
a
small
pair
of
steps
which
had
been
placed
there
for
the
purpose
and
began
to
search
for
the
screws
as
he
found
them
he
cut
out
the
hard
putty
that
concealed
them
with
a
knife
which
one
of
the
priests
had
handed
up
to
him
for
the
purpose
and
when
he
had
accomplished
this
he
exchanged
the
knife
for
a
screwdriver
and
endeavoured
to
turn
the
screws
but
this
required
more
strength
than
his
of
his
poor
body
had
left
in
it
and
he
was
obliged
to
relinquish
the
task
to
one
of
the
other
priests
the
two
who
had
hitherto
knelt
at
the
altar
now
joined
the
group
in
front
of
the
panel
all
five
looked
unhealthy
and
frightened
but
the
one
who
next
ascended
the
steps
made
a
brave
effort
and
began
to
remove
the
screws
he
was
a
muscular
man
but
it
was
hard
work
requiring
his
full
strength
and
those
present
held
their
breath
and
anxiously
watched
him
straining
every
sinew
and
meanwhile
the
storm
gathered
overhead
the
lightning
and
thunder
flashed
and
crashed
almost
simultaneously
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
having
removed
the
screws
the
priest
descended
the
steps
which
he
pushed
on
one
side
and
inserting
the
screwdriver
into
a
crevice
prised
the
panel
outward
it
resisted
for
some
time
then
suddenly
yielding
fell
forward
on
his
head
and
crashed
noisily
to
the
ground
all
present
started
and
stared
the
panel
had
concealed
an
aperture
a
small
niche
rudely
made
by
simply
removing
some
of
the
masonry
it
was
long
and
low
and
there
lay
in
it
what
was
unmistakably
the
body
of
a
young
child
fully
dressed
the
priests
fell
back
lady
fulda
parted
lips
became
set
in
the
act
of
uttering
a
word
the
duke
groaned
aloud
while
an
expression
of
not
being
able
to
believe
their
own
eyes
settled
upon
the
countenances
of
lord
dawne
galbraith
and
the
tutor
ellis
after
the
fall
of
the
panel
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
very
storm
seemed
to
wait
in
suspense
nobody
knew
what
to
do
next
but
before
they
had
recovered
themselves
angelica
broke
the
silence
at
the
top
of
her
voice
you
pushed
me
she
angrily
exclaimed
i
did
diavolo
retorted
you
did
i
did
smack
and
miss
stood
trembling
with
rage
in
the
aisle
then
she
darted
toward
the
aperture
the
priests
fell
back
i
believe
it
all
a
trick
she
said
reaching
up
and
seizing
the
child
by
its
petticoats
lady
fulda
uttered
an
exclamation
the
duke
stood
up
angelica
tugged
the
figure
out
of
the
niche
looked
at
it
and
then
held
it
to
the
light
it
was
a
huge
wax
considerably
battered
which
had
once
been
a
favourite
of
her
own
diavolo
came
out
of
his
seat
hugging
himself
and
bursting
in
eloquent
silence
father
ricardo
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
lord
dawne
bit
his
under
lip
lady
fulda
gathered
herself
up
from
her
knees
and
stood
helpless
everybody
looked
foolish
including
the
duke
whose
eyebrows
contracted
nervously
then
suddenly
that
treacherous
memory
of
his
landed
him
back
in
the
old
days
by
jove
he
exclaimed
aloud
i
more
like
angelica
and
less
of
a
damned
fool
than
i
thought
come
diavolo
this
is
no
place
for
us
angelica
cried
she
seized
his
hand
and
they
both
darted
into
the
sacristy
there
was
a
bang
a
scuffle
and
then
a
dull
thud
but
the
first
to
follow
was
only
in
time
to
see
eight
clinging
for
a
moment
outside
to
the
ledge
of
one
of
the
narrow
windows
which
was
open
they
jumped
out
it
fourteen
feet
hush
listen
and
then
the
congregation
scattered
hurriedly
from
the
sacred
precincts
leaving
the
candles
burning
on
the
altar
the
doll
lying
on
the
pavement
the
gaping
niche
and
the
fallen
panel
to
bear
witness
to
some
of
the
incredible
phases
through
which
the
human
race
passes
on
its
way
from
incomprehensible
nothingness
to
the
illimitable
unknown
chapter
xi
the
heavenly
twins
had
disappeared
for
the
night
those
who
ran
round
to
the
outside
wall
of
the
sacristy
to
look
for
them
found
only
a
shred
of
angelica
gown
hanging
on
a
shrub
their
footsteps
could
be
followed
cutting
across
the
grass
of
a
soppy
lawn
but
beyond
that
was
a
walk
of
hard
asphalt
and
there
all
trace
of
them
was
lost
but
lady
fulda
said
they
must
be
found
and
brought
back
and
sleepy
servants
were
accordingly
aroused
and
set
to
search
the
grounds
while
grooms
were
sent
off
on
horseback
to
scour
the
lanes
the
storm
was
still
muttering
in
the
distance
but
above
morne
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
crescent
moon
shone
out
to
facilitate
the
search
it
was
quite
fruitless
however
from
morne
to
morningquest
the
messengers
went
passing
backward
and
forward
from
the
castle
the
whole
night
long
lady
fulda
never
closed
her
eyes
and
when
the
party
assembled
at
breakfast
next
morning
they
were
all
suffering
from
want
of
sleep
the
duke
lord
dawne
galbraith
ellis
father
ricardo
and
the
four
strange
priests
were
at
table
what
have
become
of
those
children
lady
fulda
was
exclaiming
for
the
hundredth
time
when
the
door
opened
and
the
twins
themselves
appeared
hand
in
hand
smiling
affably
they
looked
as
fresh
as
usual
and
began
to
perform
their
morning
salutations
with
their
habitual
where
have
you
been
the
duke
asked
sternly
in
bed
of
course
angelica
answered
till
we
got
up
at
least
where
else
should
we
be
she
looked
round
in
innocent
inquiry
we
just
ran
round
to
the
garden
door
you
know
diavolo
explained
and
went
to
bed
you
could
expect
us
to
stay
out
on
a
dripping
night
like
that
lord
dawne
afterward
expressed
the
feeling
of
the
whole
household
when
he
declared
well
it
never
did
and
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
me
to
look
for
them
in
their
own
rooms
he
remained
behind
with
them
in
the
breakfast
room
that
morning
when
the
others
withdrew
i
suppose
we
shall
be
sent
for
directly
said
angelica
resignedly
diavolo
grinned
i
say
how
did
you
feel
last
night
when
it
was
all
going
on
she
inquired
awfully
nice
he
rejoined
i
had
little
warm
shivers
all
over
me
so
had
i
she
said
like
small
electric
shocks
and
i
believed
in
the
ghost
and
everything
i
expect
that
is
why
that
kind
of
supernatural
business
is
kept
up
because
it
makes
people
feel
creepy
and
nice
you
ca
get
the
same
sensation
in
any
other
way
and
i
dare
say
there
are
lots
of
people
who
would
like
to
lose
a
whole
set
of
sensations
i
should
think
they
the
kind
of
people
who
collect
the
remains
of
a
language
to
save
it
when
it
begins
to
die
out
i
should
say
those
were
intelligent
people
her
uncle
observed
angelica
looked
at
him
doubtfully
well
at
any
rate
should
like
to
believe
in
ghosts
said
diavolo
so
should
i
said
angelica
in
fun
you
know
and
i
was
thinking
so
last
night
but
then
i
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
fool
aunt
fulda
was
making
of
herself
and
grandpapa
looked
such
a
precious
old
idiot
too
they
were
enjoying
it
a
bit
you
were
the
only
one
of
the
family
uncle
dawne
who
believed
and
looked
dignified
who
told
you
i
believed
he
asked
well
i
not
sure
that
you
did
angelica
answered
but
at
all
events
your
demeanour
was
respectful
hence
the
dignity
perhaps
if
yours
were
a
little
more
respectful
you
would
gain
in
dignity
too
i
imagine
diavolo
observed
angelica
boxed
his
ears
promptly
whereupon
her
uncle
took
her
to
task
with
unusual
severity
for
him
you
are
quite
grown
up
now
he
said
you
talk
like
a
mature
woman
and
act
like
a
badly
brought
up
child
of
ten
you
are
always
doing
something
ridiculous
too
i
should
be
ashamed
to
have
you
at
my
house
angelica
looked
amazed
well
it
is
your
fault
as
much
as
anybody
she
burst
out
when
she
had
recovered
herself
why
do
you
make
me
something
of
a
life
you
ca
expect
me
to
go
on
like
this
forever
getting
up
in
the
morning
riding
driving
lessons
dressing
and
bed
it
the
life
of
a
lapdog
she
got
up
and
going
to
one
of
the
windows
which
was
open
leant
out
dawne
and
diavolo
followed
her
as
the
former
approached
she
turned
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
for
an
answer
you
will
marry
eventually
he
began
like
poor
edith
she
suggested
dawne
compressed
his
lips
that
was
her
ideal
angelica
proceeded
her
own
home
and
husband
and
family
someone
to
love
and
trust
and
look
up
to
she
told
me
all
about
it
at
fountain
towers
under
the
influence
of
indignation
and
strong
tea
and
she
was
exquisite
womanly
creature
no
thank
you
it
is
safe
to
be
an
exquisite
womanly
in
this
rotten
world
the
most
useful
kind
of
heart
for
a
woman
is
one
hard
enough
to
crack
nuts
with
nobody
could
wring
it
then
you
would
lose
all
finer
feeling
lord
dawne
began
including
the
heartache
itself
she
supplemented
but
what
you
want
he
asked
an
object
she
answered
something
something
something
beyond
the
mere
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
going
to
bed
at
night
with
an
interval
of
exercise
between
i
want
to
do
something
for
somebody
lord
dawne
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
he
had
no
idea
that
such
a
notion
had
ever
entered
her
head
at
this
point
a
servant
was
sent
by
his
grace
to
request
the
twins
to
be
so
good
as
to
go
to
him
in
the
library
at
once
it
is
the
inevitable
inquiry
angelica
said
resignedly
come
with
us
uncle
she
coaxed
it
is
sure
to
be
fun
lord
dawne
consented
on
the
way
diavolo
remarked
ambiguously
but
i
do
understand
yet
how
there
came
to
be
a
ghost
as
well
the
inquiry
led
to
nothing
the
heavenly
twins
had
determined
not
to
incriminate
themselves
and
they
refused
to
answer
a
question
they
stood
together
drawn
up
in
line
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
changed
from
one
leg
to
the
other
when
they
were
tired
and
looked
exceedingly
bored
but
they
would
not
speak
the
duke
stormed
lady
fulda
entreated
father
ricardo
prayed
even
lord
dawne
begged
them
not
to
be
obstinate
but
it
was
all
in
vain
and
their
grandfather
losing
all
patience
ordered
them
out
of
the
room
at
last
as
they
retired
diavolo
asked
father
ricardo
if
he
were
thinking
of
thumbscrews
i
feel
quite
sure
that
angelica
did
not
know
the
doll
was
there
lord
dawne
said
when
the
twins
had
gone
i
fancy
it
was
a
trick
diavolo
had
played
her
nobody
mentioned
the
ghost
again
it
was
felt
to
be
a
delicate
subject
lady
fulda
was
made
to
take
rest
and
a
tonic
the
duke
was
rigidly
dieted
and
father
ricardo
was
sent
away
for
change
of
air
but
the
twins
never
ceased
from
troubling
as
soon
as
the
duke
temper
was
restored
they
consulted
the
party
collectively
at
afternoon
tea
in
the
oriel
room
on
the
subject
of
angelica
dissatisfaction
diavolo
affected
to
share
it
but
that
was
only
by
way
of
being
agreeable
as
he
inadvertently
betrayed
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
do
something
myself
he
drawled
in
his
lazy
way
i
should
think
marriage
is
the
best
profession
for
you
said
angelica
scornfully
thank
you
i
will
consider
the
question
diavolo
answered
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
his
habitual
attitude
with
his
head
on
the
windowsill
beaming
about
him
blandly
the
army
is
the
only
possible
profession
for
a
gentleman
in
your
position
the
duke
observed
ah
that
would
not
meet
my
views
at
present
diavolo
rejoined
i
am
advised
that
the
army
is
not
a
career
for
a
man
it
is
a
career
for
a
machine
for
a
machine
with
a
talent
for
converting
other
men
into
machines
and
i
have
the
talent
i
suppose
if
uncle
dawne
marry
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
into
the
house
of
lords
eventually
but
in
the
meantime
i
should
like
to
be
doing
some
good
in
the
world
you
might
go
into
parliament
his
uncle
suggested
ah
no
diavolo
answered
seriously
i
should
never
dream
of
undertaking
any
of
the
actual
work
of
the
world
while
there
are
plenty
of
good
women
to
do
it
for
me
my
modest
idea
was
to
be
a
musician
or
philanthropic
lecturer
or
artist
of
some
kind
something
that
gives
pleasure
you
know
and
the
proceeds
to
be
devoted
to
the
indigent
may
i
ask
if
you
belong
to
the
peace
party
said
the
duke
i
am
a
peace
party
myself
diavolo
answered
anybody
who
has
lived
as
long
with
angelica
as
i
have
would
be
that
if
he
were
not
a
party
in
pieces
i
admire
your
wit
said
angelica
sarcastically
diavolo
bestowed
a
grateful
smile
upon
her
but
everything
is
easy
enough
for
a
man
of
intellect
she
went
on
whatever
his
position
it
is
powers
that
are
wasted
vanity
vanity
said
lady
fulda
why
do
you
suppose
that
your
abilities
are
superior
i
can
prove
that
they
are
angelica
answered
hotly
then
suddenly
her
spirits
went
up
and
she
began
to
be
sociable
for
a
few
days
after
this
the
heavenly
twins
appeared
to
be
very
busy
they
both
wrote
a
great
deal
and
also
practised
regularly
on
their
violins
and
the
piano
and
they
made
some
mysterious
expeditions
slipping
away
unattended
into
morningquest
it
was
suspected
that
they
had
something
serious
on
hand
but
father
ricardo
being
away
the
was
suspended
so
nobody
knew
one
morning
however
big
placards
which
had
been
printed
in
london
appeared
on
every
hoarding
in
morningquest
announcing
in
the
largest
type
that
miss
and
theodore
would
give
an
entertainment
in
the
theatre
for
the
benefit
of
certain
of
the
city
charities
which
were
specified
the
programme
opened
with
music
which
was
to
be
followed
by
a
speech
from
theodore
and
to
conclude
with
a
monologue
entitled
the
condemned
cell
to
be
delivered
by
miss
who
had
written
it
specially
for
the
occasion
this
was
the
news
which
greeted
and
lady
adeline
upon
their
return
from
their
voyage
round
the
world
and
like
everybody
else
when
they
first
saw
the
placard
which
was
as
they
drove
from
the
station
through
morningquest
to
the
castle
they
exclaimed
who
on
earth
is
the
old
duke
was
rather
taken
with
the
idea
of
the
entertainment
it
was
something
quite
in
the
manner
of
his
youth
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
inopportune
arrival
of
his
and
daughter
the
heavenly
twins
would
probably
have
carried
out
their
programme
under
his
distinguished
patronage
galbraith
was
all
in
favour
of
letting
them
do
it
lord
dawne
was
neutral
but
objected
he
caused
the
announcement
to
be
cancelled
and
handsomely
indemnified
the
various
charities
named
to
be
recipients
of
the
possible
proceeds
diavolo
did
not
much
mind
he
was
prepared
to
do
all
that
angelica
required
of
him
but
when
the
necessity
was
removed
he
acknowledged
that
it
would
have
been
rather
a
bore
and
afterward
spoke
disrespectfully
of
the
whole
project
as
the
condemned
sell
angelica
raged
but
the
energy
which
had
collected
during
his
travels
was
not
yet
expended
he
summoned
a
family
council
at
morne
to
sit
upon
the
twins
and
having
tried
them
in
their
absence
they
were
sent
for
to
be
sentenced
without
the
option
of
appeal
angelica
was
to
be
presented
at
court
and
otherwise
brought
out
in
proper
splendour
immediately
while
with
a
view
to
going
into
the
guards
eventually
diavolo
was
to
be
sent
to
sandhurst
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
the
necessary
examinations
about
which
ellis
said
there
would
be
no
difficulty
diavolo
diavolo
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
did
mind
angelica
said
nothing
but
her
brow
contracted
diavolo
indifference
was
putting
an
end
to
everything
it
was
not
that
she
had
any
actual
objection
to
going
to
court
and
coming
out
but
only
to
the
way
in
which
the
arrangement
had
been
made
to
the
coercion
in
fact
she
was
too
shrewd
however
not
to
perceive
that
in
consequence
of
diavolo
attitude
rebellion
on
her
part
would
be
both
undignified
and
ineffectual
so
she
held
her
peace
and
went
to
walk
off
her
irritation
in
the
grounds
alone
and
there
she
encountered
her
fast
friend
of
many
years
standing
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
who
was
just
riding
in
to
lunch
at
the
castle
when
he
saw
her
he
dismounted
and
angelica
snatched
the
whip
from
his
hand
and
clenching
her
teeth
gave
the
horse
a
vicious
slash
with
it
which
set
him
off
at
a
gallop
into
the
woods
kilroy
let
him
go
but
he
was
silent
for
some
seconds
and
then
he
asked
her
in
his
peculiarly
kindly
way
what
is
the
matter
angelica
marry
me
said
angelica
stamping
her
foot
at
him
marry
me
let
me
do
as
i
chapter
xii
evadne
spent
eighteen
months
in
malta
without
going
from
the
island
for
a
change
but
at
the
end
of
her
second
cold
season
she
went
to
switzerland
with
the
malcomsons
and
sillingers
and
colonel
colquhoun
went
on
leave
at
the
same
time
alone
to
some
place
which
he
vaguely
described
as
the
continent
when
they
met
again
evadne
noticed
a
change
in
him
and
she
feared
it
was
a
change
for
the
worse
he
was
out
of
health
out
of
temper
and
depressed
he
had
spent
most
of
his
leave
at
monte
carlo
but
he
did
not
say
so
at
first
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
question
him
had
she
done
so
he
would
have
said
something
snappy
about
feminine
curiosity
as
she
did
not
do
so
he
lost
his
temper
went
off
to
the
mess
and
drank
too
much
it
is
a
terrible
thing
for
a
man
to
be
brought
into
constant
association
with
a
woman
who
never
does
anything
in
a
small
way
that
he
can
carp
at
or
says
a
word
he
can
contradict
she
robs
him
of
all
his
most
cherished
illusions
she
shakes
his
confidence
in
his
own
infallible
strength
discernment
knowledge
judgment
and
superiority
generally
she
outrages
his
prejudices
on
the
subject
of
what
a
woman
ought
to
be
and
leaves
him
nothing
with
which
to
compare
himself
to
his
own
advantage
this
is
the
miserable
state
to
which
evadne
was
rapidly
reducing
poor
colonel
colquhoun
not
certainly
of
but
with
the
best
intentions
he
did
not
like
her
opinions
therefore
she
ceased
to
express
opinions
in
his
presence
he
took
exception
to
many
of
her
observations
and
so
she
let
the
words
i
think
fall
out
of
her
vocabulary
and
confined
her
talk
to
a
clear
narrative
of
occurrences
uninterrupted
by
comments
it
was
an
art
which
she
had
to
acquire
for
she
had
no
natural
aptitude
for
it
her
faculty
of
observation
having
hitherto
served
as
an
instrument
with
which
she
could
extract
lessons
from
life
a
lens
used
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
data
on
exact
scientific
principles
as
matter
from
which
to
draw
conclusions
but
with
practice
she
became
an
adept
in
the
art
of
describing
the
one
while
at
the
same
time
withholding
the
other
so
that
her
conversation
interested
colonel
colquhoun
without
however
giving
him
anything
to
cavil
at
it
was
like
a
dish
exactly
suited
to
his
taste
but
delicate
to
insipidity
because
his
palate
was
hardened
to
pepper
when
she
returned
from
switzerland
she
gave
him
details
of
her
own
doings
which
were
interesting
enough
to
take
him
out
of
himself
until
one
day
when
unfortunately
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
making
an
effort
to
entertain
him
and
he
determined
that
he
would
be
entertained
like
a
child
indeed
she
might
be
a
deuced
clever
woman
and
all
that
but
he
was
going
to
have
those
feminine
airs
of
superiority
so
he
snubbed
her
into
silence
and
having
succeeded
he
became
exceedingly
annoyed
because
she
would
not
talk
it
was
opposition
he
wanted
not
acquiescence
but
she
was
not
clever
enough
with
all
her
cleverness
this
straightforward
nineteenth
century
young
woman
to
understand
such
subtleties
she
had
always
heard
that
the
contrariness
of
women
was
a
cause
of
provocation
and
she
could
never
have
been
made
to
comprehend
that
the
removal
of
the
cause
would
be
even
more
provoking
than
the
contrariness
the
great
endeavour
of
her
life
had
been
to
cultivate
or
acquire
the
qualities
in
which
she
understood
that
women
are
wanting
and
when
she
succeeded
she
expected
to
please
but
she
found
colonel
colquhoun
as
peculiar
on
the
subject
as
her
father
had
been
when
she
proved
that
although
of
the
imbecile
sex
she
could
do
arithmetic
colonel
colquhoun
waited
a
week
to
snap
at
her
for
asking
him
how
he
had
spent
his
leave
but
he
was
obliged
at
last
to
give
up
all
hope
of
being
questioned
and
then
he
felt
himself
aggrieved
she
certainly
took
no
interest
in
him
whatever
he
reflected
she
did
care
a
rap
if
he
went
to
the
dogs
altogether
in
fact
she
would
probably
be
rather
glad
because
then
she
would
be
free
she
would
waste
a
world
of
attention
and
care
upon
any
dirty
little
child
she
picked
up
in
the
street
but
for
him
she
had
neither
thought
nor
sympathy
clearly
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
and
she
should
get
rid
of
him
he
felt
he
was
going
to
the
bad
he
go
to
the
bad
it
was
all
her
fault
and
she
should
know
it
he
had
treated
her
with
every
possible
consideration
she
had
never
had
the
slightest
cause
for
complaint
he
had
even
stuck
up
for
her
against
his
own
interests
with
her
old
ass
of
a
father
and
by
jove
while
she
was
treating
him
colonel
colquhoun
commanding
a
crack
corps
and
one
of
the
smartest
officers
in
her
majesty
service
with
studied
indifference
she
was
thinking
affectionately
of
the
same
dear
old
pompous
portly
papa
to
whom
in
fact
she
had
never
borne
the
slightest
colonel
colquhoun
was
sure
although
he
had
done
her
the
injury
of
allowing
her
to
marry
herself
to
the
kind
of
man
whom
it
was
against
her
principles
even
to
countenance
but
at
this
point
his
irritation
overflowed
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
do
you
know
where
i
spent
most
of
my
leave
he
asked
one
morning
at
breakfast
no
evadne
answered
innocently
at
monte
carlo
he
said
with
emphasis
i
hope
you
enjoyed
it
i
have
always
heard
it
is
a
very
beautiful
place
she
responded
tranquilly
it
effect
on
my
exchequer
has
not
been
beautiful
he
observed
grimly
indeed
she
answered
is
it
so
expensive
gambling
is
when
you
lose
he
declared
ah
yes
i
forgot
the
tables
at
monte
carlo
she
remarked
quite
cheerfully
i
suppose
you
can
lose
a
great
deal
there
you
can
lose
all
you
possess
well
yes
of
course
you
could
if
you
liked
but
i
am
quite
sure
you
would
never
do
anything
so
stupid
he
looked
at
her
curiously
you
do
disapprove
of
gambling
then
he
asked
i
oh
of
course
i
disapprove
but
then
you
see
i
have
no
taste
for
it
this
was
apologetically
said
to
signify
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
mean
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
him
you
have
a
fine
taste
for
driving
people
to
such
extremities
then
he
asserted
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
what
i
mean
is
this
he
explained
that
if
i
could
have
been
with
you
i
should
not
have
gone
to
monte
carlo
evadne
kept
her
countenance
with
some
difficulty
for
just
as
colonel
colquhoun
spoke
she
recollected
a
conversation
they
had
had
at
breakfast
one
morning
under
precisely
similar
circumstances
that
is
to
say
each
in
their
accustomed
place
and
temper
she
placidly
content
he
politely
striving
to
bottle
up
the
chronic
form
of
irritation
from
which
he
suffered
at
that
time
of
the
day
so
as
to
keep
it
nice
and
hot
for
the
benefit
of
his
officers
and
men
for
colonel
colquhoun
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
was
one
person
but
colonel
colquhoun
in
his
own
orderly
room
or
on
parade
was
quite
another
while
in
barracks
he
was
in
the
habit
of
swearing
with
the
same
ease
and
as
unaffectedly
as
he
made
the
responses
in
church
he
probably
did
it
from
a
sense
of
duty
because
he
had
been
brought
up
in
that
school
of
colonel
and
in
the
course
of
years
would
naturally
come
to
consider
that
a
volley
of
oaths
on
parade
although
not
laid
down
in
the
drill
book
was
as
much
a
part
of
his
profession
of
arms
as
good
lord
deliver
us
is
of
the
church
service
at
all
events
he
did
both
punctually
at
the
right
time
and
place
and
never
mixed
his
oaths
with
his
sunday
responses
which
was
creditable
in
fact
he
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
changing
his
frame
of
mind
completely
for
the
different
occasions
and
would
be
prepared
in
advance
as
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
if
a
glove
went
wrong
just
as
he
was
starting
for
church
he
would
send
up
for
another
pair
amiably
but
if
a
similar
accident
happened
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
parade
he
would
swear
at
his
man
till
he
surprised
him
the
man
not
being
a
soldier
servant
but
what
very
nearly
made
evadne
smile
was
the
distinct
recollection
she
had
of
having
asked
him
earnestly
to
join
her
party
in
switzerland
when
he
went
on
leave
and
of
his
answering
no
he
should
not
care
about
that
and
suggesting
that
she
should
meet
him
at
monaco
instead
she
fancied
he
must
have
a
bad
memory
but
of
course
she
said
nothing
what
is
the
use
of
saying
anything
she
thought
however
that
had
she
been
under
his
orders
the
invitation
to
go
to
monaco
would
have
been
a
command
and
the
present
implied
reproach
a
direct
accusation
she
was
most
anxious
that
he
should
understand
perfectly
that
she
quite
shrank
from
interfering
with
him
in
any
way
one
night
not
knowing
if
he
were
at
home
or
not
she
had
occasion
to
go
downstairs
for
a
book
she
had
forgotten
there
was
no
noise
in
the
house
and
consequently
when
she
opened
the
drawing
room
door
she
was
startled
to
find
that
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
that
there
was
a
party
assembled
there
consisting
of
three
strange
ladies
loud
in
appearance
one
or
two
men
she
knew
and
some
she
had
not
seen
before
the
majority
were
seated
at
a
playing
while
the
rest
stood
round
looking
on
and
they
must
have
reached
a
momentous
point
in
the
game
for
evadne
had
not
heard
a
sound
to
warn
her
of
their
presence
before
she
saw
them
colonel
colquhoun
was
one
of
those
looking
on
at
the
game
and
one
of
the
first
to
see
her
he
changed
countenance
and
came
forward
hastily
conscious
of
the
strange
contrast
she
presented
to
those
women
flushed
with
wine
and
horrid
excitement
gambling
at
the
table
as
she
stood
there
rooted
to
the
spot
with
surprise
in
her
draperies
with
a
look
on
her
sweet
grave
face
it
was
a
vision
of
holiness
breaking
in
upon
a
scene
of
sin
and
his
one
thought
was
to
get
her
away
there
was
always
that
saving
grace
of
the
fallen
angel
about
him
he
never
depreciated
what
he
had
lost
but
sometimes
sighed
for
it
sorrowfully
i
beg
your
pardon
for
this
intrusion
evadne
said
looking
at
him
pointedly
so
as
to
ignore
the
rest
of
the
party
i
did
not
even
know
that
you
were
at
home
i
had
forgotten
a
book
and
came
for
it
will
you
kindly
give
it
to
me
it
is
called
she
hesitated
but
it
does
not
matter
she
added
quickly
i
will
read
something
else
and
she
turned
smiling
without
seeming
to
have
seen
anyone
but
colonel
colquhoun
and
calmly
swept
from
the
room
monica
the
complacent
i
should
say
one
of
the
men
suggested
or
vengeance
smiling
with
murder
in
her
mind
said
another
no
a
saint
for
certain
jeered
one
of
the
women
why
not
say
an
angel
at
once
cried
another
i
should
have
thought
colquhoun
could
keep
either
upon
the
premises
laughed
the
third
the
lady
you
are
pleased
to
criticise
is
my
wife
gentlemen
said
colonel
colquhoun
lashing
out
at
them
suddenly
his
face
blazing
with
rage
the
women
tried
not
to
be
abashed
the
men
apologised
but
the
game
was
over
for
that
night
and
the
party
broke
up
abruptly
when
they
had
gone
colonel
colquhoun
looked
about
for
evadne
book
and
found
it
not
a
difficult
matter
for
she
had
a
bad
habit
of
leaving
the
book
she
was
reading
open
and
face
downward
on
any
piece
of
furniture
not
intended
to
hold
books
by
preference
a
chair
where
somebody
might
sit
down
upon
it
this
one
happened
to
be
upon
the
piano
stool
colonel
colquhoun
glanced
at
the
title
as
he
picked
it
up
and
reading
a
vision
of
sin
understood
why
she
had
shrunk
from
naming
it
he
appreciated
her
delicacy
but
he
feared
the
discernment
which
had
shown
her
the
necessity
for
it
and
he
determined
to
disarm
her
resentment
next
day
by
making
her
a
proper
apology
at
once
he
went
down
late
to
breakfast
expecting
black
looks
at
least
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
calm
and
equable
as
usual
and
busy
keeping
his
breakfast
hot
for
him
i
wish
to
apologise
to
you
for
the
scene
you
witnessed
last
night
he
began
ceremoniously
i
think
i
owe
an
apology
for
taking
you
unawares
like
that
she
interrupted
cheerfully
giving
her
best
attention
to
a
very
full
cup
of
coffee
she
was
carefully
carrying
round
the
table
to
him
but
i
hope
you
understand
it
was
an
accident
i
quite
understood
he
answered
sullenly
but
i
want
to
explain
that
those
people
were
also
here
by
accident
at
least
i
was
not
altogether
responsible
for
their
presence
they
were
a
party
from
one
of
the
yachts
in
the
harbour
i
met
them
here
at
the
door
just
as
i
was
coming
in
last
night
and
they
forced
themselves
in
uninvited
i
hope
you
believe
that
i
would
not
willingly
bring
anyone
to
the
house
whom
i
could
not
introduce
to
you
oh
i
quite
believe
it
she
answered
cordially
you
are
always
most
kind
most
considerate
but
i
fear
she
added
with
concern
that
my
being
here
must
inconvenience
you
at
times
pray
pray
do
not
let
that
be
the
case
i
should
regret
it
infinitely
if
you
did
when
evadne
left
colonel
colquhoun
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
sat
chin
on
chest
hands
in
pockets
legs
stretched
out
before
him
giving
way
to
a
fit
of
deep
disgust
he
had
always
had
a
poor
opinion
of
women
but
now
he
began
to
despair
of
them
altogether
and
this
comes
of
letting
them
have
their
own
way
and
educating
them
he
reflected
the
first
thing
they
do
when
they
begin
to
know
anything
is
to
turn
round
upon
us
and
say
we
are
good
enough
and
by
jove
if
we
are
is
it
their
fault
is
it
their
business
to
keep
us
right
when
a
fellow
had
too
good
a
time
in
his
youth
and
suffered
for
it
what
is
to
become
of
him
if
he
ca
find
some
innocent
girl
to
believe
in
him
and
marry
him
but
there
soon
wo
be
any
innocent
girls
here
am
i
now
a
most
utter
bad
lot
and
evadne
knows
it
and
what
does
she
do
apologizes
for
appearing
at
an
inopportune
time
now
beston
wife
would
have
brought
the
house
about
his
ears
if
she
caught
him
with
that
precious
party
i
had
here
last
night
and
that
what
a
woman
ought
to
do
she
ought
to
she
ought
to
be
jealous
and
cry
her
eyes
out
she
ought
to
go
down
on
her
knees
and
take
some
trouble
to
save
a
fellow
soul
it
may
be
mentioned
by
the
way
that
if
evadne
done
so
colonel
colquhoun
would
certainly
have
sworn
at
her
for
meddling
with
things
she
no
business
to
know
anything
about
it
was
however
not
what
he
but
what
she
have
done
that
he
was
considering
just
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
he
concluded
and
i
do
see
what
to
be
gained
by
this
indifference
articulation
ceased
here
because
the
startling
theory
that
a
vicious
dissipated
man
is
not
a
fallen
angel
easily
picked
up
but
a
frightful
source
of
crime
and
disease
recurred
to
him
with
the
charitable
suggestion
that
a
repentant
woman
of
his
own
class
would
be
the
proper
person
to
reform
him
ideas
which
settled
upon
his
soul
and
silenced
him
being
for
him
with
the
cruel
certainty
that
the
end
of
all
womanliness
is
at
hand
chapter
xiii
colonel
colquhoun
first
interest
in
evadne
lasted
longer
than
might
have
been
expected
but
the
pleasure
of
hanging
about
her
palled
on
him
at
last
and
then
he
fell
off
in
his
kind
attentions
this
did
not
happen
however
as
soon
as
it
would
have
done
by
many
months
had
their
relations
been
other
than
they
were
it
began
in
the
usual
way
little
acts
to
which
she
had
become
accustomed
were
omitted
resumed
again
and
once
more
omitted
intermittently
then
finally
allowed
to
drop
altogether
when
the
change
had
set
in
for
certain
evadne
regretted
it
the
kindly
feeling
for
each
other
which
had
come
to
exist
between
them
was
largely
due
to
her
appreciation
of
the
numberless
little
attentions
which
it
had
pleased
him
to
pay
her
at
first
they
had
not
palled
upon
her
and
she
missed
them
not
as
a
wife
would
have
done
however
and
that
she
knew
so
that
when
the
fact
that
there
to
be
a
falling
off
became
apparent
she
found
in
it
yet
another
cause
for
and
one
that
was
great
enough
to
remove
all
sting
from
the
regret
what
she
was
prepared
to
resent
however
was
any
renewal
of
the
gush
after
it
had
once
ceased
she
required
to
be
held
in
higher
estimation
than
a
toy
which
could
be
dropped
and
taken
up
again
upon
occasion
and
colonel
colquhoun
gave
her
an
opportunity
and
what
was
worse
provoked
her
into
saying
so
to
her
intense
mortification
when
she
came
to
reflect
there
was
to
be
a
ball
at
the
palace
one
night
a
grand
affair
given
in
honour
of
that
same
fat
foreign
prince
who
had
stayed
with
her
people
at
fraylingay
just
before
she
came
out
and
had
been
struck
by
the
promise
of
her
appearance
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
colonel
colquhoun
had
given
her
some
very
beautiful
antique
ornaments
of
egyptian
design
and
she
determined
to
wear
them
on
this
occasion
for
the
first
time
but
when
she
came
to
try
them
with
a
modern
she
found
that
they
made
the
latter
look
detestably
vulgar
she
therefore
determined
to
design
a
costume
or
to
adapt
one
which
should
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
artistic
beauty
of
her
jewels
and
this
idea
with
the
help
of
an
excellent
maid
she
managed
to
carry
out
to
perfection
which
by
the
way
was
the
accident
that
led
her
finally
to
adopt
a
distinctive
style
of
dress
always
a
dangerous
experiment
but
in
her
case
fortunately
so
admirably
successful
that
it
was
never
remarked
upon
as
strange
by
people
of
taste
only
as
appropriate
colonel
colquhoun
dined
at
mess
on
the
night
of
the
ball
and
did
not
trouble
himself
to
come
back
to
escort
her
he
said
he
would
meet
her
at
the
palace
and
if
he
missed
her
in
the
crowd
there
were
sure
to
be
plenty
of
other
men
only
too
glad
to
offer
her
an
arm
he
had
been
most
particular
never
to
allow
her
to
go
anywhere
alone
at
first
rather
inconveniently
so
sometimes
but
that
she
had
endured
she
was
reflecting
upon
the
change
as
she
sat
at
her
solitary
dinner
that
evening
and
she
concluded
by
cheerfully
assuring
herself
that
she
really
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
as
if
she
were
married
but
afterward
when
she
found
herself
in
the
drawing
room
it
seemed
big
and
bare
and
all
the
more
so
for
being
brilliantly
lighted
and
suddenly
she
felt
herself
a
very
little
body
all
alone
there
was
no
bitterness
in
the
feeling
however
because
there
was
no
one
neglecting
her
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
her
heart
up
but
it
threatened
to
grow
upon
her
all
the
same
and
in
order
to
distract
herself
she
went
downstairs
to
choose
a
bouquet
she
had
several
sent
her
for
every
occasion
and
they
were
always
arranged
on
a
table
in
the
hall
so
that
she
might
take
the
one
that
pleased
her
best
as
she
went
out
there
were
more
than
usual
this
evening
there
was
one
from
the
grand
duke
which
she
put
aside
there
was
one
from
colonel
colquhoun
he
always
ordered
them
by
the
dozen
for
the
different
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
she
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
was
beautiful
in
its
way
but
sent
at
the
florist
discretion
not
chosen
to
suit
her
gown
and
it
did
not
suit
it
so
that
she
could
not
have
used
it
in
any
case
yet
she
put
it
down
with
a
sigh
the
next
was
of
yellow
roses
violets
and
maidenhair
fern
very
sweet
with
lord
groome
compliments
she
read
on
the
card
that
was
tied
to
it
he
is
back
then
i
suppose
she
thought
funny
old
man
very
sorry
but
you
wo
do
the
next
was
from
one
of
the
survivals
a
man
she
loathed
she
thought
it
an
impertinence
for
him
to
have
sent
her
flowers
at
all
and
she
threw
them
under
the
table
the
rest
she
took
up
one
after
the
other
reading
the
cards
attached
and
admiring
or
disapproving
of
the
different
combinations
without
gratitude
or
sentiment
she
knew
that
prompted
all
of
the
offerings
that
were
not
merely
sent
just
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
there
was
one
unconventional
bunch
however
that
caught
her
eye
it
was
a
mere
handful
of
scarlet
flowers
tied
loosely
together
with
ribbons
of
their
own
colour
and
the
same
tint
of
green
as
their
leaves
it
was
from
a
young
subaltern
in
the
regiment
a
boy
whom
she
had
noticed
first
because
he
was
the
same
age
and
somewhat
resembled
her
brother
bertram
and
had
grown
to
like
afterward
for
himself
his
flowers
were
the
first
to
arouse
her
to
any
expression
of
pleasure
the
arrangement
was
new
at
the
time
but
it
has
since
become
common
enough
he
has
done
that
for
me
himself
she
thought
the
boy
respects
me
i
shall
wear
his
flowers
they
are
beautiful
too
she
added
holding
them
off
at
arm
length
to
admire
them
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
almost
immediately
after
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room
price
was
shown
in
he
was
the
person
of
all
others
at
that
moment
in
malta
whom
she
would
most
have
liked
to
see
could
she
have
chosen
and
her
face
brightened
at
once
when
he
entered
i
have
been
dining
with
your
husband
regiment
he
explained
and
i
found
that
he
could
not
come
back
for
you
to
take
you
to
the
ball
and
that
therefore
you
would
have
to
go
alone
and
so
i
ventured
to
come
myself
and
offer
you
my
escort
ah
how
good
you
are
evadne
cried
feeling
fully
for
the
first
time
how
much
she
had
in
heart
been
dreading
the
ordeal
of
having
perhaps
to
enter
the
ball
room
alone
the
old
gentleman
surveyed
her
some
seconds
in
silence
that
original
he
said
at
last
with
several
nods
approvingly
and
that
is
a
glorious
piece
of
colour
you
have
in
your
hand
is
it
not
she
said
more
beautiful
i
think
than
all
my
jewels
yes
he
agreed
the
flowers
are
the
finishing
touch
the
ball
had
begun
when
evadne
arrived
and
the
first
person
she
encountered
was
the
grand
duke
who
begged
for
a
dance
and
took
her
to
the
ball
room
a
dance
was
just
over
however
when
they
entered
the
great
room
was
pretty
clear
and
the
prince
led
her
toward
the
further
end
where
their
hostess
was
sitting
there
also
was
colonel
colquhoun
and
and
some
other
men
with
guthrie
brimston
he
had
forgotten
evadne
for
the
moment
and
she
was
so
transformed
by
the
beautiful
lines
of
her
dress
that
he
had
looked
at
her
hard
and
admiringly
before
he
recognized
her
who
the
lady
with
the
grand
duke
major
livingston
exclaimed
someone
with
a
figure
by
jove
said
old
lord
groome
loyal
egypt
herself
said
guthrie
brimston
always
apt
at
analogy
why
it
evadne
said
colonel
colquhoun
did
know
his
own
wife
by
jove
lord
groome
exclaimed
well
i
hope
i
may
be
pardoned
at
that
distance
rejoined
colonel
colquhoun
confused
royal
egypt
is
more
audacious
than
ever
guthrie
brimston
observed
this
is
a
new
departure
the
reign
of
ideas
is
over
i
fancy
and
a
season
of
social
success
has
begun
evadne
danced
till
daylight
unconscious
of
the
sensation
she
had
made
and
rose
next
morning
fresh
for
the
usual
occupations
of
the
day
but
her
success
of
the
night
before
had
so
enhanced
her
value
in
colonel
colquhoun
estimation
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
effusive
he
returned
to
lunch
and
hung
about
her
the
whole
afternoon
much
to
her
inconvenience
because
he
had
not
been
included
in
her
arrangements
for
some
months
now
and
she
could
not
easily
alter
them
all
at
once
just
to
humour
a
whim
of
his
but
wherefore
the
whim
a
very
little
reflection
explained
it
looks
and
tones
and
words
of
her
partners
of
the
previous
night
not
heeded
at
the
time
recurred
to
her
now
and
made
her
thoughtful
but
she
could
not
feel
flattered
for
it
was
obviously
not
her
whom
colonel
colquhoun
was
worshipping
it
was
success
and
the
perception
of
this
truth
suggested
a
possible
parallel
which
made
her
shudder
it
was
a
terrible
glimpse
of
what
might
have
been
what
certainly
have
been
had
not
the
dear
lord
vouchsafed
her
the
precious
knowledge
which
had
preserved
her
from
the
ultimate
degradation
and
the
insult
which
such
an
endeavour
as
that
of
a
woman
she
had
in
her
mind
to
win
back
a
wandering
husband
would
have
resulted
in
do
not
care
was
her
happy
thought
when
she
began
to
see
less
of
colonel
colquhoun
but
a
wife
would
feel
differently
and
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
had
i
been
his
wife
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
her
submit
to
his
extra
attentions
in
silence
that
afternoon
because
that
was
her
way
but
he
found
her
looking
at
him
once
or
twice
with
an
expression
of
deep
thought
in
her
eyes
which
provoked
him
at
last
to
ask
what
it
was
all
about
i
was
thinking
she
answered
of
that
painful
incident
in
femme
de
where
julie
so
far
forgot
her
as
to
try
to
her
admiration
for
her
by
displaying
her
superior
accomplishments
at
the
house
of
that
low
woman
mme
de
sčricy
you
remember
she
made
quite
a
sensation
by
her
singing
son
mari
réveillé
par
le
rôle
venait
de
jouer
voulut
fantaiste
et
la
prit
en
goűt
comme
il
eűt
fait
actrice
i
was
thinking
when
she
became
aware
of
what
she
had
done
of
the
degradation
of
the
position
in
which
she
had
placed
herself
how
natural
it
was
that
she
should
despise
herself
cursing
marriage
which
had
brought
her
to
such
a
pass
and
wishing
herself
dead
colonel
colquhoun
became
moody
upon
this
my
having
stayed
at
home
with
you
this
afternoon
suggests
a
parallel
i
suppose
after
your
success
of
last
night
he
inquired
and
you
have
been
congratulating
yourself
all
day
he
proceeded
summing
up
judicially
upon
having
escaped
the
degradation
of
being
the
wife
of
a
man
whose
admiration
for
you
could
cool
under
any
circumstances
and
be
revived
again
by
a
vulgar
success
in
society
she
was
silent
and
he
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
house
from
where
she
sat
she
saw
him
go
twirling
his
blond
moustache
with
one
hand
and
viciously
flipping
at
the
flowers
as
he
passed
with
the
stick
he
carried
in
the
other
a
fine
man
in
appearance
certainly
and
not
wanting
in
intelligence
since
he
could
comprehend
her
so
exactly
but
oh
how
oppressive
when
in
an
admiring
mood
this
was
her
first
feeling
when
she
got
rid
of
him
but
a
better
frame
of
mind
supervened
and
then
she
suffered
some
mortification
for
having
weakly
allowed
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
speaking
so
plainly
yet
it
proved
in
the
long
run
to
have
been
the
kindest
thing
she
could
have
done
for
colonel
colquhoun
was
enlightened
at
last
and
they
were
both
the
better
for
the
understanding
but
the
house
seemed
full
of
him
still
after
he
had
gone
that
day
and
she
therefore
put
on
her
things
and
hurrying
out
into
the
fresh
air
walked
quickly
to
the
house
of
a
friend
where
she
knew
she
would
find
a
fresh
moral
atmosphere
also
she
was
soul
sick
and
depressed
life
felt
like
the
end
of
a
ball
all
confusion
and
every
carriage
up
but
her
own
torn
gowns
worn
countenances
spiteful
remarks
evident
that
were
wont
to
be
concealed
disillusion
generally
and
headache
threatening
but
fortunately
she
found
a
friend
at
home
to
whom
she
instinctively
went
for
a
moral
tonic
this
was
a
new
friend
lady
clan
the
widow
of
a
civil
service
official
who
wintered
all
over
the
world
as
a
rule
but
had
passed
that
year
at
malta
she
was
a
cheery
old
lady
masculine
in
appearance
but
with
a
great
kind
womanly
heart
full
of
sympathetic
insight
and
a
good
friend
to
evadne
whom
she
watched
with
fear
as
well
as
with
interest
doubting
much
what
would
come
of
all
that
was
unaccustomed
about
the
girl
the
sweet
grave
face
and
half
shut
eyes
appealed
to
her
pathetically
that
afternoon
in
particular
as
evadne
sat
silently
beside
her
busy
with
a
piece
of
work
she
had
brought
lady
clan
thought
her
lips
too
firm
as
she
grew
older
she
feared
her
mouth
would
harden
in
expression
if
she
were
not
happy
and
the
old
lady
inwardly
prayed
heaven
that
she
might
be
saved
from
that
prayed
that
little
arms
might
come
to
clasp
her
neck
and
warm
little
lips
shower
kisses
upon
lips
to
keep
them
soft
and
smiling
lest
they
settled
into
stony
coldness
and
forgot
the
trick
chapter
xiv
malta
was
enlivened
that
winter
by
a
joke
which
guthrie
brimston
made
without
intending
it
malcomson
had
written
a
book
she
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
had
been
married
to
a
military
man
for
ten
and
in
that
time
she
had
seen
some
things
which
had
made
a
painful
impression
upon
her
and
suggested
ideas
that
were
only
to
be
got
rid
of
by
publishing
them
ideas
cease
to
belong
to
an
author
as
soon
as
they
are
made
public
if
they
are
new
at
all
somebody
else
appropriates
them
and
if
they
are
old
as
alas
most
of
them
must
be
at
this
period
of
the
world
progress
the
mistaken
reproducer
is
relieved
of
the
horrid
responsibility
by
kindly
critics
promptly
blessed
is
the
man
who
never
flatters
himself
with
the
delusion
that
he
can
do
anything
original
for
verily
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
malcomson
made
no
such
vain
pretension
she
was
quite
clever
enough
to
know
her
own
limitations
exactly
out
of
everyday
experiences
everyday
thoughts
had
come
to
her
and
when
she
began
to
embody
such
thoughts
in
words
she
did
not
suppose
that
their
everyday
character
would
be
altered
by
the
process
she
had
not
met
any
of
those
perfect
beings
who
inhabit
the
realms
of
ideal
prose
fiction
and
make
no
mistakes
but
such
as
are
necessary
to
keep
the
story
going
nor
any
of
the
terrible
demons
without
a
redeeming
characteristic
who
haunt
the
dim
confines
of
the
same
territory
for
purposes
invariably
malign
and
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
pretend
that
she
had
she
was
a
simple
artist
educated
in
the
of
the
world
and
desiring
above
everything
to
be
honest
a
naturalist
in
fact
with
positive
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
and
incapable
of
the
confusion
of
mind
or
laxity
of
conscience
which
denies
on
the
one
hand
that
wrong
may
be
pleasant
in
the
doing
or
claims
on
the
other
with
equal
untruth
that
because
it
is
pleasant
it
must
be
if
not
exactly
right
at
all
events
excusable
so
she
endeavoured
to
represent
things
as
she
saw
them
things
real
not
imaginary
and
when
her
characters
spoke
they
talked
of
the
interests
which
were
daily
discussed
in
her
presence
and
expressed
themselves
as
human
beings
do
she
was
too
independent
to
be
conventional
and
it
was
therefore
inevitable
that
she
should
bring
both
yelp
and
bray
upon
herself
and
be
much
misunderstood
when
asked
why
she
had
written
the
book
she
answered
candidly
for
my
own
benefit
of
course
which
caused
a
perfect
howl
of
disapprobation
for
if
that
were
her
object
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
would
attain
it
as
the
book
had
been
a
success
from
the
first
but
as
people
had
hastily
concluded
that
she
was
setting
up
for
a
social
reformer
and
would
fail
they
were
naturally
disgusted
they
had
been
prepared
to
call
the
supposed
attempt
great
presumption
on
her
part
but
when
they
found
that
she
had
merely
her
own
interests
in
view
and
had
not
let
their
moral
welfare
cost
her
a
thought
they
said
she
was
not
whereupon
she
observed
i
do
mind
having
my
morals
attacked
but
i
should
object
to
be
pulled
up
for
my
grammar
meaning
that
she
was
sure
of
her
morals
but
was
half
afraid
that
her
grammar
might
be
shaky
as
is
inevitable
however
under
such
circumstances
this
obvious
interpretation
was
rejected
and
the
most
uncharitable
construction
put
upon
her
words
it
was
said
among
other
things
that
she
evidently
could
not
be
moral
at
heart
whatever
her
conduct
might
be
because
she
made
mention
of
immorality
in
her
book
her
manner
of
mentioning
the
subject
was
not
taken
into
consideration
because
such
sheep
can
not
consider
they
can
only
criticise
the
next
thing
they
did
therefore
was
to
take
out
the
incident
in
the
book
which
was
most
likely
to
damage
her
reputation
and
declare
that
it
was
autobiographical
there
was
one
man
who
knew
exactly
when
the
thing
had
occurred
who
the
characters
were
and
all
about
it
nunc
dimittis
said
malcomson
when
she
heard
the
story
for
the
same
thing
has
been
said
of
the
author
of
any
book
of
consequence
that
has
ever
appeared
and
naturally
she
was
somewhat
puffed
up
but
it
remained
for
guthrie
brimston
to
cap
the
criticisms
her
smouldering
antagonism
to
malcomson
was
kept
alight
by
a
strong
suspicion
she
had
that
malcomson
was
wont
to
ridicule
her
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
best
jokes
of
that
winter
made
by
malcomson
at
the
expense
of
guthrie
brimston
it
was
not
likely
therefore
that
the
latter
would
spare
malcomson
if
she
ever
had
an
opportunity
of
crushing
her
and
she
watched
and
waited
long
for
a
chance
until
at
last
one
night
at
a
dinner
party
she
thought
the
auspicious
moment
had
arrived
and
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
unfortunately
for
her
she
chose
a
weapon
she
was
unaccustomed
to
handle
and
in
her
awkwardness
she
injured
herself
mr
price
was
giving
the
dinner
and
malcomson
was
not
there
but
the
colquhouns
and
sillengers
were
and
other
friends
of
hers
kindly
disposed
cultivated
people
who
spoke
well
of
her
and
were
all
agreed
in
their
praise
of
her
work
guthrie
brimston
stiffened
as
she
listened
to
their
remarks
but
held
her
peace
for
a
time
with
thin
lips
compressed
and
rising
ire
apparent
i
can
not
class
the
book
said
colonel
sillenger
it
does
not
claim
to
be
fact
exactly
and
yet
it
is
not
fiction
not
a
novel
but
a
novelty
major
guthrie
brimston
put
in
clasping
his
hands
on
his
breast
twiddling
his
thumbs
and
setting
his
head
on
one
side
the
business
with
which
he
usually
accompanied
one
of
his
facetious
sallies
what
i
admire
most
about
malcomson
is
her
courage
said
price
she
ignores
no
fact
of
life
which
may
be
usefully
noticed
and
commented
upon
but
gives
each
in
its
natural
order
without
affectation
do
you
not
agree
with
me
he
asked
turning
to
guthrie
brimston
who
was
standing
beside
him
her
nostrils
flapped
if
you
mean
to
say
that
you
malcomson
book
i
do
agree
with
you
she
answered
decidedly
i
consider
it
simply
there
was
a
momentary
silence
such
as
sometimes
precedes
a
burst
of
applause
at
a
theatre
and
then
there
was
laughter
such
an
objection
from
such
a
quarter
was
considered
too
funny
and
when
it
became
known
there
was
quite
a
run
upon
the
book
for
guthrie
brimston
stories
were
familiar
to
the
members
of
all
the
messes
naval
and
military
in
and
about
the
island
not
to
mention
the
club
men
and
the
curiosity
to
know
what
she
did
consider
an
objectionable
form
of
impropriety
in
narrative
made
malcomson
fortune
from
that
time
forward
however
guthrie
brimston
influence
was
perceptibly
upon
the
wane
even
colonel
colquhoun
wearied
of
her
to
evadne
great
regret
for
guthrie
brimston
vulgarity
and
coarseness
of
mind
were
always
balanced
by
her
undoubted
propriety
of
conduct
and
her
faults
were
altogether
preferable
to
the
exceeding
polish
and
refinement
which
covered
the
absolutely
corrupt
life
of
a
new
acquaintance
colonel
colquhoun
had
made
at
this
time
a
drinkworthy
who
would
not
have
lingered
alone
with
him
anywhere
in
public
but
dressed
sumptuously
at
his
expense
the
whole
season
the
different
estimation
in
which
he
held
the
two
ladies
and
his
respect
for
evadne
herself
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
he
never
brought
drinkworthy
to
the
colquhoun
house
nor
encouraged
evadne
to
associate
with
her
as
he
had
always
encouraged
her
to
associate
with
guthrie
brimston
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
latter
influence
was
restraining
for
after
his
allegiance
to
her
relaxed
evadne
noticed
new
changes
for
the
worse
in
him
and
regretted
them
all
the
more
because
she
feared
that
a
chance
remark
of
her
own
had
had
something
to
do
with
weaning
him
from
the
guthrie
brimstons
she
had
been
having
tea
with
him
there
one
day
and
on
their
way
home
colonel
colquhoun
said
something
to
her
about
the
guthrie
brimstons
baying
been
unusually
amusing
they
only
seemed
unusually
talkative
to
me
she
answered
but
i
always
come
away
from
their
house
depressed
and
with
a
very
low
estimate
of
human
nature
generally
i
feel
that
their
mockery
is
essentially
fume
of
little
minds
and
when
they
are
particularly
facetious
at
other
people
expense
i
leave
them
with
the
pleasing
certainty
that
our
own
peculiarities
will
be
put
under
the
microscope
as
soon
as
we
are
out
of
earshot
a
species
of
inquisition
from
which
no
human
being
can
escape
with
dignity
colonel
colquhoun
reflected
upon
this
his
horror
of
being
made
to
appear
ridiculous
may
have
hitherto
blinded
him
to
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
there
is
no
knowing
but
at
all
events
it
was
from
that
time
forward
that
he
began
to
go
less
to
the
guthrie
brimstons
he
was
just
at
the
age
however
when
the
manners
of
certain
men
begin
to
deteriorate
especially
in
domestic
life
their
capacity
for
pleasure
has
been
lessened
by
abuse
and
they
have
to
excite
it
with
stimulants
they
become
less
careful
in
their
appearance
are
not
particular
in
their
choice
of
words
before
the
ladies
of
their
own
families
nor
nice
in
their
manners
at
table
if
not
already
married
they
look
about
for
something
young
and
docile
on
which
to
inflict
their
and
expect
to
have
their
maladies
of
mind
and
body
tenderly
cared
for
in
return
for
such
ecstatic
joy
as
young
wives
find
in
the
sober
certainties
of
board
and
lodging
should
they
be
married
already
however
heaven
be
good
to
their
wives
for
they
will
have
no
comfort
upon
earth
but
doubtless
in
the
good
time
coming
all
estimable
wives
will
subscribe
to
keep
up
asylums
to
which
their
husbands
can
be
quietly
removed
for
treatment
so
soon
after
the
honeymoon
as
their
manners
show
signs
of
deterioration
when
they
begin
to
be
greedy
forget
to
say
please
thank
you
and
i
beg
your
pardon
show
no
consideration
for
comfort
but
their
own
no
natural
affection
and
lose
control
of
their
tempers
the
best
thing
that
can
be
done
for
them
and
the
kindest
is
to
place
them
under
proper
restraint
at
once
they
can
not
be
treated
at
home
opposition
irritates
them
and
humouring
such
dreadful
propensities
submissively
only
confirms
them
the
deterioration
of
colonel
colquhoun
had
certainly
been
delayed
by
the
arrangement
which
in
honour
bound
him
to
treat
evadne
as
a
young
lady
and
not
as
a
wife
but
that
it
should
set
in
eventually
was
inevitable
when
it
did
begin
however
it
was
less
in
manner
for
the
same
reason
that
had
delayed
it
than
in
pursuits
and
therefore
evadne
position
was
not
affected
by
it
and
she
continued
to
have
a
kindly
affectionate
feeling
for
him
and
to
pity
him
still
without
bitterness
he
began
to
stay
out
late
at
night
at
this
time
and
she
would
hear
him
occasionally
in
the
small
hours
of
the
early
morning
returning
from
a
bachelor
dinner
party
or
a
big
at
mess
reeking
doubtless
of
tobacco
and
stimulants
verily
ouida
knows
what
she
is
writing
about
when
she
invariably
adds
essences
to
the
toilet
of
her
dissipated
men
evadne
would
wake
with
a
start
in
the
gray
of
the
dawn
sometimes
and
hearing
colonel
colquhoun
pass
her
door
with
unsteady
step
on
his
way
to
his
own
room
would
shudder
to
think
what
his
wife
must
have
suffered
and
it
was
not
as
if
the
sacrifice
of
herself
would
have
made
any
difference
to
him
either
if
she
could
have
done
any
good
in
that
way
she
might
have
tried
but
his
habits
were
formed
and
they
were
the
outcome
of
his
nature
nothing
would
have
changed
him
and
the
longer
she
lived
with
him
the
more
reason
she
had
to
be
convinced
of
this
and
to
be
sure
that
her
decision
had
been
a
right
and
wise
one
but
colonel
colquhoun
did
not
agree
with
her
he
cherished
the
vain
delusion
that
although
her
influence
as
a
young
lady
whom
he
admired
and
respected
had
not
availed
to
elevate
him
her
presence
as
a
wife
whose
feelings
he
certainly
would
not
have
felt
bound
to
consider
and
whose
opinion
he
would
not
have
cared
a
rap
for
would
have
made
all
the
difference
they
drifted
into
a
discussion
of
this
subject
one
hot
afternoon
when
he
happened
to
find
evadne
idling
for
a
wonder
with
a
fan
at
an
open
window
you
might
have
made
anything
you
liked
of
me
had
you
adopted
a
different
course
he
said
he
had
been
carousing
the
night
before
and
was
now
mistaking
nausea
and
depression
for
a
naturally
good
disposition
perverted
by
no
she
answered
gently
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
i
should
have
succeeded
where
beston
and
half
a
dozen
other
ladies
i
could
name
even
here
in
a
little
place
like
malta
all
more
lovable
estimable
and
stronger
in
womanly
attributes
generally
than
i
am
have
failed
colonel
beston
is
always
with
your
particular
clique
and
she
is
very
unhappy
she
makes
herself
miserable
then
said
colonel
colquhoun
the
natural
man
reappearing
as
the
passed
off
or
was
forgotten
what
business
is
it
of
hers
where
he
goes
or
what
he
does
so
long
as
he
is
nice
to
her
when
he
at
home
just
reverse
the
position
and
consider
what
colonel
beston
feelings
would
be
if
she
took
to
amusing
herself
as
he
does
and
maintained
that
he
had
no
business
to
interfere
with
her
private
pursuits
would
he
be
satisfied
so
long
as
she
was
to
him
at
home
evadne
asked
colonel
colquhoun
countenance
lowered
that
is
nonsense
he
said
women
are
different
they
must
behave
themselves
evadne
smiled
i
am
beginning
to
know
that
phrase
she
said
it
puzzled
me
at
first
because
it
is
neither
reason
nor
argument
but
merely
an
assertion
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
command
and
equally
applicable
to
either
sex
if
the
other
chose
to
use
it
but
i
know
that
what
you
have
just
said
with
regard
to
beston
having
no
occasion
to
make
herself
miserable
is
your
true
feeling
on
the
subject
and
therefore
i
am
convinced
that
if
i
had
a
different
course
it
would
not
have
been
to
your
advantage
in
any
way
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
very
much
to
the
reverse
of
mine
we
are
excellent
friends
as
it
is
because
we
are
quite
independent
of
each
other
but
had
it
been
otherwise
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
hopeless
misery
of
it
colquhoun
was
silent
there
is
no
hope
for
me
then
he
said
at
last
lamely
i
suppose
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
you
never
cared
for
me
at
all
you
just
thought
you
would
get
married
and
accepted
me
because
i
was
the
first
person
to
propose
and
your
friends
considered
me
eligible
i
think
you
are
evadne
i
have
watched
you
since
you
came
out
here
and
never
seen
you
fancy
any
man
even
for
a
moment
evadne
flushed
angrily
it
is
one
thing
to
consider
ethical
questions
in
relation
to
their
bearing
upon
the
future
of
the
world
at
large
and
another
to
have
it
suggested
that
you
have
been
under
observation
yourself
with
a
view
to
discovering
if
you
found
it
possible
to
live
up
to
your
own
ideas
it
was
a
fact
however
that
no
man
attracted
evadne
during
this
period
as
colonel
colquhoun
himself
had
done
the
shock
of
the
discovery
which
had
destroyed
her
passion
for
him
had
caused
a
revulsion
of
feeling
great
enough
to
subdue
all
further
possibilities
of
passion
for
years
to
come
and
even
if
she
had
been
free
to
marry
she
would
not
have
done
so
all
the
energy
of
her
nature
had
flashed
from
her
heart
to
her
brain
in
a
moment
and
every
instinct
of
her
womanhood
was
held
in
check
by
the
superior
power
of
intellect
since
the
day
of
the
marriage
ceremony
she
had
been
a
child
in
her
pleasures
and
only
mature
in
the
capacity
for
thought
her
senses
had
been
stunned
and
still
slept
heavily
but
there
remained
to
her
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
entrancing
period
which
had
followed
their
first
awakening
and
so
she
answered
colonel
last
remark
decidedly
you
are
mistaken
she
said
if
you
imagine
that
i
did
not
care
for
you
that
i
was
merely
marrying
you
for
the
sake
of
marrying
and
would
have
been
quite
as
content
with
anyone
else
whom
my
friends
might
have
considered
eligible
my
mother
was
very
much
disappointed
because
i
did
not
accept
an
offer
i
had
before
i
saw
you
from
a
man
who
was
certainly
in
every
way
i
think
you
said
my
father
had
told
you
of
it
i
could
not
care
for
but
i
think
my
passion
for
was
blinder
and
more
headlong
if
anything
than
is
usually
the
case
in
very
young
girls
it
possessed
me
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
in
church
that
first
time
you
pleased
my
eyes
as
no
other
man
has
ever
done
and
i
was
only
too
glad
to
take
it
for
granted
that
your
career
and
your
character
were
all
that
they
ought
to
have
been
but
of
course
i
did
not
love
you
for
passion
you
know
is
only
the
introduction
to
love
it
is
a
flame
that
may
be
blown
out
at
any
time
by
a
difference
of
opinion
and
mine
went
out
the
moment
i
learnt
that
your
past
had
been
objectionable
i
really
care
more
for
you
now
than
i
did
in
the
days
when
i
was
with
you
for
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
very
kind
in
every
possible
way
so
much
so
indeed
that
i
have
more
than
once
felt
the
keenest
regret
i
have
wished
that
there
was
no
barrier
between
us
there
is
no
hope
for
me
then
he
again
suggested
but
with
hope
in
his
heart
as
he
spoke
she
shook
her
head
sadly
it
is
what
might
have
been
that
i
regret
she
answered
but
that
does
not
change
what
has
been
and
is
i
suppose
you
consider
that
i
have
spoilt
your
life
he
said
oh
no
she
exclaimed
do
think
that
do
blame
yourself
i
have
never
blamed
you
since
i
was
cool
enough
to
reflect
it
is
the
system
that
is
at
fault
the
laxity
which
permits
anyone
however
unfit
to
enter
upon
the
most
sacred
of
all
human
relations
saints
should
find
a
reward
for
sanctity
in
marriage
but
the
church
with
that
curious
want
of
foresight
for
which
it
is
peculiar
induced
the
saints
to
put
themselves
away
in
barren
celibacy
so
that
their
saintliness
could
not
spread
while
it
encouraged
sinners
satiated
with
vice
to
transmit
their
propensities
from
generation
to
generation
i
believe
firmly
that
marriage
when
those
who
marry
are
of
such
character
as
to
make
the
contract
matrimony
is
a
perfect
state
fulfilling
every
law
of
our
human
nature
and
making
earth
with
all
its
drawbacks
a
heaven
of
happiness
but
such
marriages
as
we
see
contracted
every
day
are
simply
a
degradation
of
all
the
higher
attributes
which
distinguish
men
from
beasts
for
there
is
no
contract
more
carelessly
made
more
ridiculed
more
lightly
broken
no
sacred
subject
that
is
oftener
blasphemed
and
nothing
else
in
life
affecting
the
dignity
and
welfare
of
man
which
is
oftener
attacked
with
vulgar
ribaldry
in
public
or
outraged
in
private
by
the
secret
conduct
of
it
no
you
are
not
to
blame
nor
am
i
it
is
not
our
fault
that
we
form
the
junction
of
the
old
abuses
and
the
new
modes
of
thought
some
two
people
must
have
met
as
we
have
for
the
benefit
of
others
but
it
has
been
much
better
with
us
than
it
might
have
been
thanks
to
your
kindness
i
have
been
quite
happy
here
with
you
much
happier
than
i
should
have
been
at
fraylingay
i
think
all
this
time
you
have
never
interfered
with
my
pursuits
or
endeavoured
to
restrict
my
liberty
in
any
way
and
consequently
my
occupations
and
interests
have
been
more
varied
and
my
content
greater
than
it
would
have
been
at
home
after
my
father
had
discovered
how
very
widely
we
differ
in
opinion
i
am
grateful
to
you
george
and
i
do
hope
that
it
has
been
as
well
with
you
as
it
has
been
with
me
since
i
came
to
malta
oh
yes
i
have
been
all
right
he
answered
in
a
quite
dissatisfied
tone
however
but
presently
that
passed
and
then
he
slid
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
you
are
a
good
woman
evadne
he
said
you
have
played
me
a
ah
nasty
trick
and
i
do
agree
with
you
and
i
believe
there
are
a
dozen
men
in
the
world
at
the
present
moment
who
would
agree
with
you
but
apart
from
your
peculiar
opinions
you
are
about
one
of
the
nicest
girls
i
ever
knew
everything
you
do
is
well
done
never
out
of
temper
you
do
speak
much
as
a
rule
but
you
always
ready
to
respond
cheerfully
when
you
spoken
to
and
you
interfere
i
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
you
had
never
been
taught
to
read
and
write
and
then
you
would
have
had
no
views
to
come
between
us
but
since
you
think
you
can
not
care
for
me
i
shall
not
persecute
you
i
gave
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
never
would
and
i
hope
i
have
kept
it
yes
you
have
been
goodness
itself
she
answered
i
wrote
and
told
your
father
how
very
well
we
get
on
he
continued
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
make
it
up
with
you
but
the
old
gentleman
is
obstinate
he
has
his
own
notion
of
a
wife
duty
and
he
sticks
to
it
but
i
did
my
best
because
i
know
you
feel
the
separation
from
your
own
family
although
you
never
complain
he
ca
get
over
your
wanting
a
man
for
a
husband
he
says
he
laughs
every
time
he
thinks
of
it
the
first
time
he
laughed
at
that
idea
of
yours
i
was
there
and
a
eh
unpleasant
laugh
it
was
it
got
my
back
up
somehow
and
made
me
feel
ready
to
take
your
part
against
him
it
is
a
compliment
you
know
to
have
your
laugh
outright
at
the
notion
of
your
ever
being
able
to
come
up
to
your
wife
idea
of
what
a
man
should
be
and
when
he
came
down
raging
about
your
books
it
was
the
recollection
of
that
laugh
i
believe
that
made
me
determine
to
get
them
for
you
i
asked
your
mother
to
show
me
your
old
rooms
and
i
just
took
all
the
books
i
could
find
and
then
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
make
your
new
rooms
look
as
much
like
the
old
ones
as
possible
it
was
a
very
kind
thought
evadne
answered
i
do
pretend
to
have
been
a
saint
very
much
the
contrary
colonel
colquhoun
proceeded
with
that
assumption
of
humility
often
apparent
in
the
repentant
sinner
who
expects
to
derive
both
credit
and
importance
from
his
past
when
he
frankly
confesses
it
was
wicked
but
i
hope
i
have
always
been
a
gentleman
with
her
saint
and
gentleman
were
synonymous
terms
and
what
i
want
to
say
is
he
continued
i
do
quite
see
how
to
put
it
but
you
have
just
expressed
yourself
satisfied
with
the
arrangements
i
have
made
for
you
so
far
well
if
you
really
think
that
i
have
done
all
i
can
to
make
your
life
endurable
will
you
do
something
for
me
i
am
a
good
deal
older
than
you
are
in
all
human
probability
you
will
outlive
me
will
you
promise
me
that
during
my
lifetime
you
will
not
mix
yourself
up
publicly
will
not
join
societies
make
speeches
or
publish
books
which
people
would
know
you
had
written
on
the
social
subjects
you
are
so
fond
of
of
she
ejaculated
well
perhaps
that
is
not
the
right
expression
he
conceded
no
very
far
from
the
right
expression
she
answered
gently
social
subjects
seem
to
be
forcing
themselves
on
the
attention
of
every
thoughtful
and
person
just
now
and
it
would
be
culpable
cowardice
to
shun
them
while
there
is
the
shadow
of
a
hope
that
some
means
may
be
devised
to
put
right
what
is
so
very
wrong
ignoring
an
evil
is
tantamount
to
giving
it
full
licence
to
spread
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
have
never
known
anyone
who
found
the
knowledge
of
evil
anything
but
distressing
except
guthrie
brimston
and
she
only
delights
in
it
so
long
as
it
is
made
a
jest
of
but
they
are
all
alike
in
that
set
she
belongs
to
their
ideas
of
propriety
are
bounded
by
their
sense
of
pleasure
so
long
as
you
talk
flippantly
they
will
listen
and
laugh
but
if
you
talk
seriously
on
the
same
subject
you
make
the
matter
disagreeable
and
then
they
call
it
colonel
colquhoun
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
on
the
parapet
of
the
veranda
looking
down
a
vista
of
yellow
houses
at
a
glimpse
there
was
of
the
sea
dotted
with
boats
hazy
with
heat
intensely
blue
and
sparkling
back
reflections
of
the
glaring
sun
from
where
evadne
sat
she
saw
the
same
scene
through
the
open
balustrade
over
the
tops
of
the
oleanders
growing
in
the
garden
below
and
gradually
the
heat
and
stillness
and
beauty
stole
over
her
melting
her
mood
to
tenderness
and
filling
her
mind
with
sadly
sweet
memories
of
the
days
of
delight
which
preceded
all
this
she
thought
of
the
yellow
gorse
on
the
common
recalling
its
peculiar
fragrance
of
the
misty
cobwebs
stretched
from
bush
to
bush
and
decked
with
dazzling
drops
of
dew
of
the
healthy
happy
heath
creatures
peeping
out
at
her
shyly
here
a
rabbit
and
there
a
hare
of
a
lark
that
sprang
up
singing
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
a
moment
of
a
thrush
that
paused
to
reflect
as
she
passed
she
thought
of
the
little
church
on
the
high
cliffs
the
bourne
of
her
morning
walks
of
the
long
stretch
of
sand
and
of
the
sea
and
she
felt
the
fresh
free
air
of
those
open
spaces
rouse
her
again
to
a
gladness
in
life
not
often
known
to
ladies
idling
on
languid
afternoons
in
the
sickly
heat
essential
to
the
wellbeing
of
citron
orange
and
myrtle
beloved
of
the
mythical
faun
but
fatal
to
the
best
energies
of
the
human
race
and
by
a
very
natural
transition
her
mind
leaped
on
to
that
morning
in
church
when
the
sense
of
loneliness
which
comes
to
all
young
creatures
that
have
no
mate
resolved
itself
into
that
silent
supplication
the
petition
which
it
is
a
part
of
the
joy
of
life
in
youth
to
present
to
a
heaven
which
is
willing
enough
to
hear
and
she
recalled
the
thrill
of
delight
that
trembled
through
every
nerve
of
her
body
when
she
looked
up
and
found
her
answer
when
she
saw
and
recognized
what
she
sought
in
the
glance
which
flashing
between
them
was
the
spark
that
first
fired
the
train
of
her
blind
passion
for
colonel
colquhoun
she
thought
then
that
her
prayer
was
answered
at
that
moment
and
she
believed
still
that
it
had
been
answered
so
but
for
a
special
purpose
which
she
had
not
then
perceived
colonel
colquhoun
was
not
the
husband
of
her
heart
but
the
rod
of
chastisement
for
her
rash
presumption
he
had
not
been
given
to
her
for
her
own
happiness
but
that
she
might
act
as
she
had
done
to
set
an
example
by
which
she
should
have
the
double
privilege
of
expiating
a
fault
of
her
own
and
at
the
same
time
securing
the
peace
in
life
of
others
it
was
in
this
way
there
hummed
in
her
brain
on
that
hot
afternoon
results
of
the
faith
which
had
been
held
by
her
ancestors
of
the
teaching
which
she
had
herself
received
directly
with
a
curious
glimmering
of
truths
that
were
already
half
apparent
to
her
own
acute
faculties
an
incongruous
jumble
all
leavened
by
the
natural
instincts
of
a
being
rich
in
vitality
and
wholesome
physical
force
with
the
recollection
of
the
old
days
came
back
the
shadow
of
the
old
sensation
the
interval
was
forgotten
for
the
moment
she
saw
before
her
the
man
whose
every
glance
and
word
had
thrilled
her
with
pleasurable
emotion
whom
it
had
been
a
joy
just
to
be
with
and
see
it
was
the
same
man
leaning
there
fine
of
form
and
feature
with
a
dreamy
look
in
his
blue
eyes
softening
the
glitter
which
was
apt
to
be
hard
and
stony
if
only
at
that
moment
colonel
colquhoun
looked
round
at
her
hesitated
although
his
face
flushed
and
then
exclaimed
evadne
you
love
me
i
love
you
she
answered
he
sat
down
beside
her
close
to
her
will
you
forget
all
this
he
said
will
you
forget
my
past
will
you
make
me
a
different
man
will
you
you
can
he
half
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hers
but
then
drew
back
a
gentleman
always
in
that
he
would
not
force
her
inclinations
in
any
way
if
i
do
not
change
we
can
be
again
as
we
are
now
and
there
would
be
no
harm
done
will
you
consent
evadne
will
you
my
wife
will
you
he
leant
forward
so
close
that
her
senses
were
troubled
too
close
for
she
pushed
her
chair
back
to
relieve
herself
of
the
oppression
and
the
act
irritated
him
another
moment
a
little
more
persuasion
and
caressing
of
the
voice
which
he
could
use
so
well
to
that
effect
and
she
might
have
given
in
to
the
kind
of
fascination
which
she
had
felt
in
his
presence
from
the
first
but
when
she
moved
he
drew
back
too
his
countenance
clouded
and
her
own
momentary
yearning
to
be
held
close
close
to
be
kissed
till
she
could
not
think
to
live
the
intoxicating
life
of
the
senses
only
and
not
care
was
over
we
could
never
be
again
as
we
are
now
she
answered
there
would
be
no
return
for
me
a
wife
can
not
feel
as
i
do
and
you
you
would
not
change
or
at
least
you
would
only
change
your
habits
the
consequences
of
them
you
will
carry
to
your
grave
with
you
and
i
doubt
if
you
could
ever
change
your
habits
once
for
all
you
were
a
different
man
for
a
while
when
i
first
came
out
but
you
soon
relapsed
no
i
can
never
regret
my
present
attitude
but
i
have
seen
several
times
already
how
much
reason
i
should
have
to
regret
a
different
arrangement
you
make
light
of
love
he
said
many
a
girl
has
died
of
a
disappointment
many
a
girl
is
a
fool
she
answered
placidly
and
what
can
love
offer
me
in
exchange
for
the
calm
content
of
my
life
just
now
for
my
perfect
health
for
my
freedom
from
care
a
reconciliation
with
your
family
he
suggested
she
sighed
and
sat
silent
a
little
lost
in
thought
i
do
not
live
with
my
family
now
she
answered
at
last
they
have
all
their
own
interests
their
own
loves
apart
from
mine
would
a
letter
or
two
a
year
from
them
make
up
after
all
for
the
risk
of
misery
i
should
be
running
for
the
terrible
helpless
hopeless
incurable
misery
of
an
unhappily
married
woman
if
i
should
become
one
he
rose
and
returned
to
his
old
position
leaning
over
the
veranda
looking
down
to
the
sea
you
are
i
think
evadne
he
reiterated
she
said
nothing
but
rested
her
head
on
the
back
of
her
chair
and
smiled
she
was
not
and
he
knew
it
as
well
as
she
did
she
was
only
a
nineteenth
century
woman
of
the
higher
order
with
senses
so
refined
that
if
her
moral
as
well
as
her
physical
being
were
not
satisfied
in
love
both
would
revolt
they
were
silent
some
time
after
that
and
then
he
turned
to
her
once
more
will
you
promise
me
that
one
thing
evadne
he
asked
promise
me
that
during
my
lifetime
you
will
never
mix
yourself
up
never
take
part
publicly
in
any
question
of
the
day
it
would
be
too
deuced
ridiculous
for
me
you
know
to
have
my
name
appearing
in
the
papers
in
connection
with
measures
of
reform
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
promise
to
spare
you
that
kind
of
annoyance
at
all
events
she
answered
without
hesitation
making
the
promise
not
because
she
was
infirm
of
purpose
but
because
she
was
indefinite
she
had
no
impulse
at
the
time
to
do
anything
and
no
notion
that
she
would
ever
feel
impelled
to
act
in
opposition
to
this
wish
of
his
thank
you
he
said
and
there
was
another
little
pause
which
he
was
again
the
first
to
break
you
would
have
loved
me
then
if
i
had
lived
a
different
life
he
said
yes
she
answered
simply
i
should
have
loved
you
no
other
man
has
made
me
feel
for
a
moment
what
i
felt
for
you
while
i
believed
that
you
were
all
that
a
man
should
be
who
proposes
to
marry
and
i
do
think
any
other
man
ever
will
you
were
born
for
me
why
oh
why
did
you
not
live
for
me
i
wish
to
god
i
had
he
answered
she
rose
impulsively
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
its
was
a
movement
of
pain
and
pity
sorrow
and
sympathy
and
he
understood
it
you
meant
to
marry
always
she
said
you
treasured
in
your
heart
your
ideal
of
a
woman
why
could
you
not
have
lived
so
that
you
would
have
been
ideal
too
when
at
last
you
met
he
took
her
two
little
outstretched
hands
and
held
them
a
moment
in
his
looking
down
at
them
i
wish
to
god
i
had
he
repeated
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
a
woman
has
her
ideal
as
well
as
a
man
she
said
that
she
loves
purity
and
truth
and
loathes
degradation
and
vice
more
than
a
man
does
theoretically
yes
he
answered
but
you
find
practically
that
women
will
marry
anyone
if
they
were
more
particular
we
should
be
more
particular
too
ah
that
is
our
curse
said
evadne
yours
and
mine
if
women
had
been
particular
in
the
past
you
would
have
been
a
good
man
and
i
should
have
been
a
happy
wife
he
raised
her
hands
which
he
was
still
holding
placing
them
palm
to
palm
took
them
in
one
of
his
and
clasped
them
to
his
chest
bringing
her
very
close
to
him
and
then
he
looked
into
her
upturned
face
considering
it
with
that
curious
set
expression
on
his
own
which
always
came
at
a
crisis
her
lips
were
parted
her
cheeks
were
pale
she
still
panted
from
the
passion
of
her
last
utterance
and
her
eyes
as
he
looked
down
into
them
were
pained
in
expression
and
fixed
he
let
her
hands
drop
and
once
more
returned
to
his
old
position
leaning
upon
the
balustrade
with
his
back
to
her
looking
out
over
the
sea
if
it
had
been
possible
to
have
obtained
the
mastery
he
had
dreamed
of
over
her
mere
animal
mastery
the
thought
would
have
repelled
him
now
he
might
have
dominated
her
senses
but
her
soul
would
only
have
been
the
more
confirmed
in
its
loathing
of
his
life
he
knew
the
strength
of
her
convictions
knew
that
so
long
as
they
were
a
few
yards
apart
she
could
always
have
ruled
both
herself
and
him
and
life
is
lived
a
few
yards
apart
it
was
the
best
side
of
his
nature
that
was
under
evadne
influence
and
he
had
now
some
saving
grace
of
manhood
in
him
which
enabled
him
to
appreciate
the
esteem
with
which
she
had
begun
to
repay
his
consideration
for
her
and
to
admire
the
consistent
which
had
brought
her
triumphantly
out
of
all
her
difficulties
and
won
her
a
distinguished
position
in
the
place
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
satisfied
and
knew
that
he
would
have
to
be
she
remained
standing
as
he
had
left
her
and
presently
he
turned
to
her
again
forgive
me
he
said
for
provoking
a
discussion
which
has
pained
you
needlessly
if
repentance
and
remorse
could
wipe
out
the
past
i
should
be
worthy
to
claim
you
this
minute
but
i
know
you
are
right
there
might
have
been
hours
of
intoxication
but
there
would
have
been
years
of
misery
also
for
you
as
my
wife
your
decision
was
best
for
both
of
us
it
was
our
only
chance
of
peace
he
looked
at
her
wistfully
and
approached
a
step
she
met
him
more
than
halfway
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
at
him
but
we
are
friends
george
she
said
with
emotion
i
seem
to
have
nobody
now
but
you
belonging
to
me
and
i
should
be
lonely
indeed
if
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
yes
yes
he
said
huskily
of
course
we
are
friends
the
best
friends
we
shall
always
be
friends
i
have
never
let
anyone
say
a
word
against
you
and
i
never
will
i
am
proud
to
think
that
you
are
known
by
my
name
i
only
wish
that
i
could
make
it
worthy
of
you
and
perhaps
some
day
in
the
field
poor
fellow
the
highest
proof
of
moral
worth
he
knew
of
was
to
be
able
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
some
great
butchery
of
his
without
exhibiting
a
symptom
of
fear
evadne
had
recovered
herself
and
now
smiled
up
at
him
with
wet
eyelashes
not
there
i
hope
she
answered
going
to
war
and
getting
killed
is
not
a
proof
of
affection
and
respect
which
we
modern
women
care
about
i
would
rather
keep
you
safe
at
home
and
quarrel
with
you
colonel
colquhoun
smiled
here
is
tea
he
said
seeing
a
servant
enter
the
room
behind
them
shall
we
have
it
out
here
we
shall
be
cooler
yes
by
all
means
she
answered
and
then
they
began
to
talk
of
things
indifferent
but
with
a
new
and
happy
consciousness
of
an
excellent
understanding
between
them
chapter
xv
the
following
day
as
colonel
colquhoun
went
out
in
the
afternoon
he
met
evadne
coming
in
with
malcomson
and
sillenger
evadne
was
leaning
on
malcomson
arm
she
looked
haggard
and
pale
and
the
other
two
ladies
were
evidently
also
much
distressed
has
anything
happened
colquhoun
asked
with
concern
are
you
ill
evadne
i
am
sick
at
heart
she
answered
bitterly
we
have
had
bad
news
malcomson
said
significantly
colonel
colquhoun
stood
aside
and
let
them
pass
in
then
he
went
on
to
the
club
wondering
very
much
what
the
news
could
be
there
he
found
captain
belliot
colonel
beston
and
a
few
more
of
his
particular
friends
all
discussing
something
in
tones
of
righteous
indignation
price
and
john
were
there
also
a
mail
had
just
arrived
bringing
the
details
of
edith
illness
from
morningquest
john
turned
from
the
group
and
as
he
did
so
colonel
colquhoun
noticed
that
his
gait
was
uncertain
and
his
face
was
white
and
distorted
as
if
with
physical
pain
his
impulse
was
to
offer
him
a
restorative
and
see
him
to
his
rooms
but
price
anticipated
the
kind
intention
it
was
orton
beg
who
had
written
to
evadne
and
she
had
brought
sillenger
and
malcomson
in
to
hear
the
letter
read
edith
is
quite
quite
mad
she
said
unconsciously
choosing
the
poor
girl
own
expression
and
the
most
horrible
part
of
it
is
she
knows
it
herself
she
wants
to
do
the
most
dreadful
things
and
all
the
time
she
feels
as
much
horror
of
such
deeds
as
we
should
my
aunt
says
her
sufferings
are
too
terrible
to
describe
but
she
was
growing
gradually
weaker
when
the
letter
left
how
sillenger
ejaculated
to
think
of
her
as
we
knew
her
so
beautiful
and
so
sweet
and
good
and
true
in
every
way
and
with
her
magnificent
physique
and
now
not
a
soul
that
loves
her
when
they
hear
that
she
is
gradually
weaker
would
wish
it
otherwise
my
aunt
concludes
her
letter
by
saying
am
telling
you
the
state
of
the
case
exactly
evadne
continued
i
did
not
agree
with
you
when
you
were
here
i
had
been
so
shielded
from
evil
myself
that
i
could
not
believe
in
the
danger
to
which
all
women
in
their
weakness
are
exposed
but
i
agree
with
you
now
perfectly
we
must
alter
all
this
and
we
can
put
me
into
communication
with
your
friends
and
you
will
join
us
yourself
evadne
malcomson
exclaimed
certainly
i
shall
she
answered
emphatically
then
all
at
once
something
flashed
through
her
mind
heaven
she
exclaimed
i
had
forgotten
i
can
not
i
can
not
join
you
i
have
given
my
word
to
do
nothing
so
long
as
colonel
colquhoun
is
alive
up
to
this
time
evadne
in
her
home
life
had
been
serene
and
healthy
minded
but
now
suddenly
there
came
a
change
she
began
to
ask
why
should
she
trouble
herself
nobody
who
had
a
claim
upon
her
wished
her
to
do
anything
but
dress
well
and
make
herself
agreeable
and
that
was
what
most
of
the
people
about
her
were
doing
to
the
best
of
their
ability
the
church
enjoined
that
she
should
do
her
duty
what
was
her
duty
clearly
to
acquiesce
as
everybody
else
was
doing
to
refuse
to
know
of
anything
that
might
distress
her
to
be
pleased
and
to
give
pleasure
that
was
all
that
heaven
itself
had
to
offer
her
and
if
she
could
make
heaven
upon
earth
now
with
a
fan
and
a
book
and
a
few
congenial
friends
she
would
this
was
the
first
consequence
of
her
promise
to
colonel
colquhoun
it
had
cramped
her
into
a
narrow
groove
wherein
to
struggle
would
only
have
been
to
injure
herself
ineffectually
there
comes
a
time
when
every
intellectual
being
is
forced
to
choose
some
definite
pursuits
evadne
had
been
formed
for
a
life
of
active
usefulness
but
now
she
found
herself
reduced
to
an
existence
of
objectless
contemplation
and
she
suffered
acutely
until
she
had
recourse
to
paul
and
the
pulpit
from
which
barren
fields
she
succeeded
at
last
in
collecting
samples
enough
to
make
up
a
dose
of
the
anodyne
sacred
to
her
sex
it
is
a
delicious
opiate
which
gives
immediate
relief
but
it
soothes
without
healing
and
is
in
the
long
run
deleterious
and
this
was
the
influence
under
which
evadne
entered
upon
a
new
phase
of
life
altogether
she
gave
up
reading
and
by
degrees
there
grew
upon
her
a
perfect
horror
of
disturbing
emotions
she
burnt
any
books
she
had
with
repulsive
incidents
in
them
she
would
not
have
them
about
even
lest
they
should
remind
her
there
were
some
pictures
also
in
her
rooms
which
depicted
scenes
of
human
suffering
a
battle
piece
a
storm
at
sea
a
caravan
lost
in
the
desert
and
a
prison
scene
and
those
she
had
removed
she
would
have
ended
all
such
horrors
if
she
could
but
as
that
was
impossible
she
would
not
even
think
of
them
and
accordingly
she
had
those
pictures
replaced
by
soothing
subjects
moonlit
spaces
seas
clear
brown
rivulets
lakes
that
mirrored
the
placid
mountains
and
flowers
and
birds
and
trees
she
would
look
at
nothing
that
was
other
than
restful
she
would
read
nothing
that
harrowed
her
feelings
she
would
listen
to
nothing
that
might
move
her
to
indignation
and
reawaken
the
futile
impulse
to
resist
and
she
banished
all
thought
or
reflection
that
was
not
absolutely
tranquillizing
in
effect
or
otherwise
enjoyable
but
all
this
was
extremely
enervating
she
had
owed
her
force
of
character
to
her
incessant
intellectual
activity
which
had
also
kept
her
mind
pure
and
her
body
in
excellent
condition
had
she
not
found
an
outlet
for
her
superfluous
vitality
as
a
girl
in
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
she
must
have
become
morbid
and
hysterical
as
is
the
case
with
both
sexes
when
they
remain
in
the
unnatural
state
of
celibacy
with
mental
energy
unapplied
we
are
like
running
water
bright
and
sparkling
so
long
as
the
course
is
clear
but
divert
us
into
unprogressive
shallows
where
we
lie
motionless
and
very
soon
we
stagnate
and
every
particle
of
life
within
us
becomes
offence
this
was
the
fate
which
threatened
evadne
as
her
mind
grew
sluggish
her
bodily
health
decreased
and
the
climate
began
to
tell
upon
her
malta
has
a
pet
fever
of
its
own
of
a
dangerous
kind
from
which
she
had
hitherto
escaped
but
now
quite
suddenly
she
went
down
with
a
bad
attack
and
hovered
for
weeks
between
life
and
death
colonel
colquhoun
made
arrangements
to
take
her
home
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
strong
to
be
moved
but
just
at
that
time
a
small
war
broke
out
and
his
regiment
was
one
of
the
first
to
be
ordered
to
the
front
he
was
able
to
see
her
off
however
with
other
ladies
of
the
regiment
and
he
telegraphed
to
her
friends
begging
them
to
meet
her
at
southampton
the
hope
of
seeing
them
sustained
evadne
during
the
voyage
but
when
she
arrived
only
orton
beg
appeared
the
latter
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
evadne
her
hair
had
been
cut
short
her
eyes
were
sunken
her
cheeks
were
hollow
she
was
skin
and
bone
and
the
colour
of
death
orton
beg
had
gone
on
board
the
steamer
and
evadne
had
been
brought
up
on
deck
supported
by
one
of
the
ladies
and
her
own
maid
she
looked
at
her
aunt
and
then
she
looked
beyond
her
has
my
mother
not
come
to
meet
me
she
asked
orton
beg
looked
at
her
compassionately
is
she
ill
evadne
added
no
dear
her
aunt
replied
evadne
burst
into
tears
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
and
she
was
very
weak
and
had
suffered
a
great
deal
after
her
arrival
her
pompous
papa
continued
firm
as
he
called
it
and
as
she
was
equally
firm
herself
he
would
not
have
her
at
fraylingay
he
repeated
that
if
there
were
one
human
weakness
which
is
more
reprehensible
than
another
it
is
obstinacy
and
he
told
frayling
that
she
must
choose
between
himself
and
evadne
if
she
preferred
the
latter
she
might
go
to
see
her
but
she
should
not
return
to
him
he
meant
to
be
master
in
his
own
house
and
so
on
at
the
top
of
his
voice
with
infinite
bluster
to
which
it
was
that
frayling
submitted
she
never
could
bear
a
noise
evadne
therefore
saw
nothing
of
her
mother
or
brothers
or
sisters
and
must
have
been
lonely
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
orton
beg
who
took
charge
of
her
and
nursed
her
and
brought
her
round
and
remained
with
her
until
colonel
colquhoun
returned
they
spent
most
of
their
time
in
the
western
highlands
but
stayed
also
in
london
and
paris
colonel
colquhoun
was
absent
a
year
and
made
the
most
of
every
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
at
the
end
of
the
war
he
was
made
and
promoted
to
the
rank
of
colonel
and
his
time
with
his
regiment
having
expired
he
was
further
honoured
by
being
immediately
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
depôt
at
morningquest
evadne
was
glad
to
see
him
again
she
had
missed
him
and
had
waited
anxiously
for
his
return
she
had
no
one
to
care
for
in
his
absence
no
one
that
is
to
say
who
was
specially
her
charge
to
be
attended
to
and
made
comfortable
he
had
narrowed
her
sphere
of
usefulness
down
to
that
by
the
promise
he
had
exacted
and
in
his
absence
she
had
what
to
her
was
a
useless
purposeless
existence
wandering
about
from
place
to
place
during
this
period
she
made
few
notes
in
the
commonplace
book
but
the
few
all
bore
witness
to
one
thing
her
ever
increasing
horror
of
unpleasantness
in
any
shape
or
form
end
of
book
iii
book
iv
the
tenor
and
the
an
interlude
his
words
are
bonds
his
oaths
are
oracles
his
love
sincere
his
thoughts
immaculate
his
tears
pure
messengers
sent
from
his
heart
his
heart
as
far
from
fraud
as

from

gentlemen
of
chapter
morningquest
with
the
sunset
glow
upon
it
might
have
made
you
think
of
arthur
dim
rich
city
but
morningquest
had
already
flourished
a
thousand
years
longer
than
caerlyon
and
was
just
as
many
times
more
wicked
and
it
was
known
to
be
so
although
not
a
tithe
of
the
crimes
committed
in
it
were
ever
brought
to
light
but
even
of
those
which
were
known
and
recorded
no
man
could
have
told
you
the
half
so
great
was
their
number
of
course
as
the
place
was
wicked
the
doctors
were
well
to
the
fore
combating
the
wages
of
sin
gallantly
and
the
lawyers
also
needless
to
say
were
busy
and
so
too
were
the
clergy
in
their
own
way
ecclesiasticism
being
christianity
however
was
much
neglected
so
that
for
the
most
part
the
devil
went
unmolested
in
morningquest
and
had
a
good
time
there
were
churches
besides
the
cathedral
within
the
city
boundary
and
a
large
sprinkling
of
religious
sects
of
all
denominations
which
caused
ferment
enough
to
prevent
stagnation
and
of
course
where
so
many
churches
were
the
clergy
swarmed
and
were
made
the
subject
of
the
usual
pleasantries
if
you
asked
what
good
they
were
doing
you
would
hear
that
nobody
knew
but
you
would
also
be
assured
that
at
all
events
they
were
as
a
rule
too
busy
about
candles
and
vestments
and
what
not
of
that
kind
of
thing
discussing
such
questions
with
heat
enough
to
convince
anyone
that
the
lord
in
heaven
cares
greatly
about
the
use
of
one
gaud
more
or
less
in
his
service
to
do
much
harm
but
upon
the
whole
the
attitude
of
the
citizens
toward
the
clergy
was
friendly
and
unexacting
if
nobody
heeded
them
much
nobody
opposed
them
much
either
so
that
as
in
any
other
profession
they
enjoyed
the
liberty
of
earning
their
livelihood
in
their
own
way
the
people
considered
them
without
reverence
as
a
part
of
the
population
merely
their
services
were
accepted
as
a
necessity
in
the
regular
routine
of
life
as
was
and
doubtless
they
did
good
in
some
such
way
although
the
one
was
as
much
forgotten
as
the
other
before
it
was
well
assimilated
if
the
citizens
mentioned
their
teaching
at
all
it
was
merely
to
repeat
what
they
said
of
the
clergy
themselves
that
it
did
no
harm
this
was
a
pleasantry
of
which
they
never
wearied
but
sometimes
they
would
add
to
it
another
article
of
their
faith
the
lord
is
gracious
they
would
declare
and
when
he
sends
dull
preachers
he
mercifully
sends
sleep
also
to
comfort
his
afflicted
people
so
the
preachers
preached
and
their
congregations
slumbered
tranquilly
and
everbody
was
satisfied
if
the
clergy
squabbled
amongst
themselves
and
with
their
churchwardens
their
were
rather
grateful
to
them
than
otherwise
for
varying
the
monotony
so
that
they
were
encouraged
to
wage
their
internecine
combats
to
their
hearts
content
and
when
these
lapsed
and
they
let
each
other
alone
it
was
always
interesting
to
see
how
they
turned
upon
the
bishop
but
nobody
was
disturbed
for
in
such
a
sleepy
old
place
and
the
respectable
part
of
it
sleepy
men
habitually
view
the
vagaries
of
their
friends
with
smiling
tolerance
and
if
they
comment
upon
them
at
all
it
is
without
bitterness
in
general
history
there
are
always
events
as
there
are
people
that
take
prominent
places
and
attract
attention
long
after
similar
events
are
buried
and
forgotten
they
owe
their
vitality
less
to
their
importance
perhaps
than
to
some
gleam
of
poetry
pathos
or
romance
which
distinguishes
the
actors
in
them
and
most
old
places
have
a
pet
tragedy
amongst
their
traditions
but
morningquest
was
an
exception
to
this
rule
for
although
it
had
its
particular
tragedy
it
was
quite
a
new
one
from
the
first
however
it
was
easy
enough
to
foresee
that
this
one
event
of
all
the
sorrowful
things
which
had
happened
in
that
bad
old
place
having
as
it
were
every
desirable
requirement
of
time
setting
and
person
to
invest
it
with
a
proper
permanent
and
most
pathetic
interest
was
the
likeliest
one
to
be
remembered
morningquest
was
a
city
of
singers
and
the
citizens
were
proud
of
their
cathedral
choir
which
was
chiefly
recruited
from
amongst
themselves
there
being
a
succession
of
exquisite
constantly
forthcoming
to
awaken
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
ancient
pile
and
the
sweet
old
sentiments
in
the
people
hearts
some
of
the
lay
clerks
had
been
choristers
themselves
and
amongst
them
was
one
who
had
been
especially
noted
as
a
boy
for
his
birdlike
treble
it
seemed
a
thousand
pities
when
it
broke
but
as
he
reached
maturity
he
found
himself
able
to
sing
again
and
eventually
he
developed
a
very
true
if
not
very
powerful
tenor
voice
and
rose
in
time
to
be
the
leading
tenor
in
the
choir
people
had
flocked
to
hear
him
sing
in
his
childhood
and
as
they
still
came
it
was
natural
that
he
should
continue
to
think
himself
the
attraction
and
also
natural
that
he
should
be
somewhat
puffed
up
in
consequence
he
wore
a
moustache
he
wore
a
ring
he
put
on
airs
he
scented
his
he
ogled
the
pretty
ladies
in
the
canon
pew
like
an
officer
but
he
was
an
orphan
and
had
a
poor
old
kinswoman
depending
upon
him
and
kept
her
well
he
was
harmless
he
never
did
anyone
an
nor
said
an
evil
thing
and
he
could
sing
so
that
taken
all
round
his
good
qualities
outweighed
his
weaknesses
and
he
was
duly
allowed
the
measure
of
praise
and
respect
which
he
earned
but
his
rings
and
his
scents
and
his
affectations
generally
covered
a
secret
ambition
he
wanted
to
be
more
than
a
tenor
in
the
choir
he
wanted
to
be
an
opera
singer
and
he
entered
into
negotiations
with
a
london
he
did
so
secretly
being
fearful
of
discouragement
and
also
because
he
wished
to
surprise
his
friends
and
when
a
personal
interview
became
necessary
he
did
not
ask
for
the
means
to
make
the
journey
he
had
the
management
of
the
choir
funds
and
there
being
a
surplus
in
his
hands
at
the
moment
he
made
use
of
the
money
borrowing
it
in
perfect
good
faith
and
honestly
sure
that
he
would
be
able
to
repay
it
before
it
was
required
of
him
had
he
succeeded
the
money
would
have
been
returned
at
once
but
alas
he
did
not
succeed
the
money
was
spent
his
hopes
were
shattered
and
his
honest
career
was
at
an
end
if
only
he
had
come
to
me
the
matter
might
have
been
put
right
the
dean
said
and
he
publicly
reproached
himself
for
not
knowing
the
hearts
of
his
people
better
so
that
he
might
have
entered
with
sympathy
into
their
lives
and
won
their
confidence
the
tenor
ought
to
have
trusted
him
but
he
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
was
a
poor
crushed
creature
and
had
abandoned
hope
but
he
went
back
to
morningquest
nevertheless
indeed
where
else
could
he
go
he
knew
no
other
place
and
had
never
a
friend
elsewhere
in
the
world
so
he
went
back
mechanically
and
he
went
to
the
cathedral
and
there
he
hid
himself
and
there
three
times
a
day
for
three
days
he
looked
down
from
the
clerestory
himself
unseen
looked
into
the
faces
he
knew
so
well
faces
which
had
been
friendly
faces
eyes
that
had
watched
him
kindly
all
his
life
and
out
there
in
the
cold
he
followed
the
services
at
which
he
had
been
wont
to
assist
taking
a
leading
part
almost
so
long
as
he
could
remember
and
there
in
the
grim
solitude
by
day
and
the
added
horror
of
ghostly
darkness
by
night
he
lived
on
thought
and
suffered
his
agony
of
remorse
and
the
minor
miseries
of
cold
and
hunger
and
thirst
till
the
need
of
endurance
ceased
to
be
felt
and
then
amid
the
misty
morning
grayness
of
the
fourth
day
he
hanged
himself
from
a
ladder
left
by
some
workmen
engaged
in
repairs
by
whom
his
body
was
afterward
found
desecrating
the
sacred
precincts
these
are
the
materials
out
of
which
morningquest
wove
its
pet
tragedy
the
event
happened
at
the
beginning
of
that
important
year
which
the
heavenly
twins
spent
with
their
grandfather
at
morne
and
doubtless
they
heard
all
about
it
but
being
very
much
occupied
with
a
variety
of
absorbing
interests
at
the
time
it
did
not
make
any
particular
impression
upon
them
it
was
brought
home
to
them
eventually
however
when
it
might
have
been
considered
an
old
story
but
it
had
not
become
so
then
in
anybody
estimation
nor
has
it
since
because
of
the
pity
of
it
which
lent
the
pathetic
interest
that
makes
a
story
deathless
and
ageless
the
subtle
something
which
influences
to
better
moods
and
from
which
the
years
as
they
pass
do
not
detract
but
rather
pay
it
the
tribute
of
an
occasional
addition
thereto
by
which
its
hope
of
immortality
is
greatly
strengthened
after
the
tenor
death
the
difficulty
had
been
who
should
succeed
him
there
was
nobody
immediately
forthcoming
and
this
had
put
the
dean
and
chapter
in
a
fix
for
it
happened
that
there
were
services
of
particular
importance
going
on
in
the
cathedral
at
the
time
to
which
strangers
flocked
from
a
distance
and
it
was
felt
that
it
would
never
do
to
disapppoint
them
of
their
music
so
on
the
morning
of
the
great
day
of
all
after
the
early
service
the
dean
the
precentor
and
the
organist
having
doffed
their
surplices
returned
to
the
choir
and
stood
for
some
time
beside
the
brazen
lectern
discussing
the
subject
while
they
were
so
engaged
a
gentleman
came
up
to
the
dean
and
after
making
a
graceful
apology
for
the
intrusion
explained
that
he
had
heard
of
their
difficulty
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sing
the
tenor
part
and
a
solo
at
the
afternoon
service
the
dean
looked
doubtful
the
precentor
judging
by
the
appearance
and
tone
that
he
might
be
somebody
was
inclined
to
be
obsequious
the
organist
struck
a
neutral
attitude
and
stood
by
ready
to
agree
to
anything
i
can
sing
the
applicant
said
modestly
answering
the
doubt
he
saw
in
the
dean
demeanour
although
i
confess
that
i
have
not
been
doing
so
lately
i
think
i
may
venture
to
promise
however
that
i
shall
not
at
all
events
spoil
the
service
well
sir
the
dean
replied
if
you
help
us
you
will
really
be
putting
us
under
a
great
obligation
for
we
are
in
a
most
awkward
dilemma
what
do
you
say
mr
precentor
i
should
say
as
the
organist
is
here
if
this
gentleman
would
try
his
part
this
morning
that
is
what
i
was
about
to
suggest
the
stranger
interposed
the
precentor
found
the
music
the
organist
retired
to
his
instrument
the
dean
took
a
seat
and
the
stranger
sang
when
he
paused
the
dean
arose
i
thank
you
sir
he
said
with
effusion
and
i
gratefully
accept
your
offer
the
stranger
bowed
to
his
little
audience
returned
the
music
and
left
the
building
he
was
a
young
man
tall
and
striking
in
appearance
clean
shaven
with
delicate
features
dark
dreamy
gray
eyes
and
a
tumbled
mop
of
golden
hair
innocent
of
parting
he
was
but
his
clothes
hung
upon
him
loosely
as
if
he
had
grown
thinner
since
they
were
made
his
face
was
pale
too
and
pinched
in
appearance
and
his
movements
were
languid
giving
him
altogether
the
air
of
a
man
just
recovering
from
some
serious
illness
that
he
was
a
gentleman
no
one
would
have
doubted
for
a
moment
nor
would
they
have
been
surprised
to
hear
that
he
was
a
great
man
in
the
sense
of
being
a
peer
or
something
of
that
kind
for
there
was
that
indefinable
something
in
his
look
and
bearing
which
people
call
aristocratic
and
his
manner
was
calm
and
assured
like
that
of
a
man
of
the
world
accustomed
to
good
society
the
people
who
flocked
to
the
afternoon
service
that
day
regarded
him
with
much
curiosity
and
he
was
certainly
unlike
anyone
whom
they
had
hitherto
seen
in
the
choir
a
surplice
had
been
found
for
him
and
the
dead
white
contrasted
well
with
the
brightness
of
his
hair
and
made
the
refined
beauty
of
his
face
even
more
remarkable
than
it
had
been
in
his
morning
dress
sitting
with
the
lay
clerks
behind
the
choristers
he
looked
like
the
representative
of
another
and
a
higher
race
and
even
those
of
them
whose
personal
attractions
had
hitherto
been
considered
more
than
merely
passable
when
they
appeared
beside
him
were
suddenly
seen
to
be
hopelessly
commonplace
but
although
the
interest
he
excited
was
evident
enough
it
was
equally
evident
that
he
himself
remained
quite
unaware
of
it
in
his
whole
bearing
there
was
not
the
slightest
assumption
he
entered
with
the
choir
and
might
have
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
all
his
life
so
perfectly
unconscious
did
he
seem
of
anything
new
or
strange
in
the
position
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
without
even
glancing
at
the
people
he
had
taken
up
his
music
and
continued
lost
in
the
study
of
it
until
the
service
opened
and
then
he
sang
his
part
with
ease
and
precision
which
however
attracted
less
attention
at
the
moment
than
his
appearance
the
rest
of
the
choir
animated
by
his
presence
exerted
themselves
to
the
utmost
but
were
too
delighted
with
their
own
performances
to
think
much
of
his
before
the
solo
began
then
however
they
awoke
the
first
note
he
uttered
was
a
long
of
such
rich
volume
and
so
sweet
that
the
people
held
their
breath
and
looked
up
this
world
recedes
it
disappears
heaven
opens
my
eyes
my
ears
with
sounds
seraphic
ring
lend
lend
your
wings
i
mount
i
fly
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
it
was
as
if
a
delicious
spell
had
been
cast
upon
the
congregation
which
held
them
bound
until
the
last
note
of
the
exquisite
voice
even
the
last
reverberation
of
the
organ
accompaniment
had
trembled
into
silence
and
then
there
was
a
movement
a
flutter
a
great
sigh
of
relief
heaved
so
to
speak
as
if
the
pleasure
had
been
too
great
and
nerves
and
senses
were
glad
to
be
released
from
the
tension
of
it
the
tenor
was
slightly
flushed
when
he
resumed
his
seat
but
otherwise
his
face
was
as
serenely
impassive
as
ever
it
is
some
great
singer
from
abroad
the
people
whispered
to
each
other
he
is
used
to
every
kind
of
success
and
does
not
even
trouble
himself
to
see
if
we
are
pleased
he
has
sung
doubtless
to
gratify
some
whim
of
his
own
such
artists
are
capricious
folk
to
which
the
answer
was
long
may
such
whims
continue
after
the
service
the
dean
hastened
to
thank
the
stranger
he
shook
his
hand
with
emotion
and
congratulated
him
upon
his
marvellous
gift
may
i
ask
if
you
are
a
professional
singer
the
old
gentleman
said
not
yet
was
the
answer
but
i
wish
to
offer
myself
for
the
vacant
post
of
tenor
in
the
choir
if
you
are
satisfied
with
my
attainments
the
dean
stared
at
him
oh
ah
he
stammered
in
his
surprise
and
then
he
added
something
apologetically
about
references
and
being
obliged
to
ask
a
few
questions
if
you
have
the
time
to
spare
i
think
i
can
satisfy
you
now
the
stranger
answered
the
dean
perceiving
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
him
alone
bowed
courteously
and
requested
the
applicant
to
accompany
him
to
the
deanery
the
precentor
who
had
assisted
at
the
interview
up
to
this
point
now
watched
them
depart
and
as
he
did
so
he
pursed
up
his
lips
significantly
the
stranger
had
sunk
in
his
estimation
from
the
possible
rank
of
a
russian
prince
to
that
of
a
simple
singer
a
considerable
drop
but
the
precentor
was
a
musician
and
he
asserted
that
the
voice
was
of
the
finest
quality
and
trained
to
perfection
he
wanted
to
know
however
what
could
bring
a
man
with
a
fortune
like
that
in
his
throat
to
bury
himself
alive
in
morningquest
and
he
ventured
to
predict
that
it
must
be
something
fishy
the
stranger
had
a
long
private
interview
with
the
dean
but
what
transpired
thereat
was
never
made
public
it
was
known
however
that
when
he
left
the
deanery
the
dean
himself
accompanied
him
to
the
door
and
there
shook
hands
with
him
cordially
and
it
was
immediately
afterward
announced
that
jones
was
to
be
the
new
tenor
indeed
said
morningquest
sarcastically
as
much
as
the
bishop
and
the
precentor
was
sure
that
the
dean
had
been
taken
in
by
a
clever
impostor
which
would
not
have
been
the
case
he
asserted
if
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
him
as
it
ought
to
have
been
but
morningquest
declared
that
there
was
no
imposition
about
that
voice
and
as
to
antecedents
why
it
was
absurd
to
be
too
particular
when
everything
else
was
so
entirely
satisfactory
there
happened
to
be
a
tiny
tenement
in
the
close
vacant
when
the
new
lay
clerk
began
his
duties
as
tenor
in
the
choir
and
this
he
took
it
was
a
detached
house
one
of
a
row
which
faced
the
apse
on
the
south
side
of
the
cathedral
one
step
led
down
from
the
road
into
the
little
front
garden
and
another
from
that
into
the
house
which
was
thus
two
steps
below
the
road
in
front
but
was
level
with
the
garden
at
the
back
the
passage
ran
right
through
the
house
the
garden
door
being
opposite
the
front
door
the
kitchen
was
behind
a
little
sitting
room
on
the
right
as
you
entered
and
on
the
left
were
two
other
rooms
when
the
tenor
took
the
house
the
one
looking
into
the
back
garden
the
other
into
the
front
but
these
two
rooms
he
immediately
turned
into
one
by
having
the
dividing
wall
removed
and
together
they
made
a
long
low
but
comfortably
proportioned
apartment
with
a
french
window
at
either
end
the
tenor
spent
all
his
spare
time
when
he
first
arrived
in
decorating
this
room
work
for
himself
as
the
people
said
and
indeed
that
was
just
what
he
seemed
to
be
doing
for
he
worked
as
a
man
does
who
feels
that
he
ought
to
be
occupied
but
he
takes
no
pleasure
and
finds
no
relief
in
any
occupation
he
frescoed
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
his
room
with
admirable
taste
and
skill
making
it
look
twice
the
size
by
cunning
divisions
of
the
pattern
on
the
walls
and
by
the
proportions
of
dado
and
cornice
the
dean
often
went
to
watch
him
at
his
work
and
sat
on
a
packing
case
the
only
article
which
the
room
contained
at
the
time
by
the
hour
together
talking
to
him
a
circumstance
which
taken
with
the
fact
that
other
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
also
called
upon
him
and
lingered
long
on
the
premises
greatly
exercised
the
inquisitive
minds
of
the
multitude
especially
when
it
was
perceived
that
the
tenor
instead
of
being
elated
by
their
condescension
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
continued
always
the
same
sad
preoccupied
impassive
seldom
smiling
never
surprised
taking
no
healthy
interest
in
anything
when
the
painting
was
finished
furniture
began
to
arrive
and
this
was
another
surprise
for
the
close
where
houses
were
not
adorned
with
the
designs
of
any
one
period
but
were
filled
with
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
articles
generally
aged
and
remarkably
uncouth
everything
in
the
tenor
long
low
room
on
the
contrary
even
down
to
the
shape
of
the
brass
coal
scuttle
and
including
the
case
of
the
grand
piano
was
in
harmony
with
the
colour
and
design
of
the
frescoes
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
floor
which
was
polished
being
adorned
here
and
there
with
rugs
which
suggested
dim
reflections
of
the
tint
and
tone
above
it
was
a
luxurious
apartment
but
not
effeminate
the
luxury
was
masculine
luxury
refined
and
significant
there
was
no
meaningless
feminine
fripperies
about
nor
was
there
any
evidence
of
sensuous
it
was
the
abode
of
a
cultivated
man
but
of
one
who
was
essentially
manly
withal
the
fame
of
this
apartment
having
been
noised
abroad
the
precentor
came
one
day
to
inspect
it
there
is
no
need
to
describe
this
precentor
one
knows
exactly
what
a
man
must
be
who
calls
things
fishy
he
was
an
ordained
clergyman
but
not
at
all
benevolent
neither
was
he
a
christian
for
he
did
not
love
his
neighbour
as
himself
and
his
visit
on
this
occasion
was
anything
but
friendly
in
intention
he
was
determined
to
know
something
more
about
the
tenor
he
said
and
he
meant
to
question
him
his
theory
was
that
the
tenor
had
been
a
public
singer
but
had
disgraced
himself
and
was
unable
to
appear
again
in
consequence
and
on
this
supposition
he
intended
to
proceed
he
found
the
tenor
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
but
the
precentor
was
not
delicate
about
detaining
him
he
walked
into
the
sitting
room
without
waiting
to
be
asked
pried
impertinently
into
everything
and
then
sat
down
the
tenor
meantime
had
remained
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
patiently
waiting
and
he
still
stood
but
the
precentor
did
not
take
the
hint
you
are
an
opera
singer
i
think
you
said
he
remarked
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
the
tenor
looked
at
him
inquiringly
or
was
it
concerts
he
suggested
a
trifle
disconcerted
the
tenor
looked
gravely
amused
it
was
not
the
music
halls
of
course
the
precentor
persuasively
insinuated
well
hardly
said
the
tenor
fixing
his
steady
eyes
upon
the
man
in
a
way
that
made
him
wince
i
have
some
business
to
attend
to
in
the
town
he
added
pray
make
yourself
at
home
so
long
as
it
pleases
you
to
remain
with
which
he
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
glossy
hair
put
on
his
hat
and
sauntered
out
leaving
his
gentle
guest
to
ruminate
the
interest
which
the
tenor
had
begun
by
exciting
in
the
breasts
of
the
quiet
inhabitants
of
morningquest
did
not
diminish
all
at
once
as
might
have
been
expected
he
was
only
a
lay
clerk
to
be
sure
but
then
he
was
so
utterly
unlike
any
other
lay
clerk
he
was
always
so
carefully
dressed
for
one
thing
and
maintained
so
successfully
that
suggestion
of
good
breeding
which
had
been
their
first
impression
of
him
was
altogether
so
distinguished
in
appearance
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
strangers
exclaim
who
that
and
to
be
able
to
surprise
them
with
the
rejoinder
oh
that
is
only
our
tenor
then
he
was
a
stranger
from
nobody
knew
where
he
went
by
the
name
of
jones
which
was
not
believed
to
be
his
he
had
a
magnificent
voice
and
he
remained
in
morningquest
in
an
obscure
position
making
nothing
of
it
true
he
must
have
means
but
what
after
all
were
the
means
which
he
appeared
to
possess
compared
with
the
means
which
he
might
be
enjoying
and
further
and
this
was
considered
the
most
extraordinary
circumstance
of
all
there
was
his
attitude
in
the
cathedral
he
followed
the
services
devoutly
and
such
a
thing
as
attention
let
alone
devotion
on
the
part
of
a
lay
clerk
had
never
been
heard
of
in
morningquest
there
was
not
even
a
remote
tradition
in
existence
to
prepare
anybody
mind
for
such
a
contingency
so
that
altogether
the
man
was
a
mystery
a
mystery
however
toward
which
the
kindly
people
were
and
no
wonder
for
the
manners
were
as
attractive
as
his
appearance
and
his
ways
were
not
at
all
mysterious
when
considered
apart
from
the
points
already
indicated
but
on
the
contrary
simple
in
the
extreme
the
ways
of
one
who
is
kindly
courteous
and
considerate
on
all
occasions
paying
proper
respect
to
every
man
and
also
rigorously
exacting
from
each
the
respect
that
was
due
to
himself
he
would
always
see
people
who
called
upon
him
and
though
it
was
believed
that
he
would
rather
not
have
been
disturbed
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
show
it
in
fact
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
a
gentleman
before
everything
and
not
at
all
like
a
jones
and
therefore
acting
on
some
instinctive
perception
of
the
fitness
of
things
the
citizens
dropped
the
offensive
appellation
altogether
and
called
him
the
tenor
simply
as
they
might
have
called
him
the
duke
there
was
at
first
a
good
deal
of
wonder
as
to
where
the
money
came
from
with
which
he
furnished
his
little
house
in
the
close
how
did
he
manage
to
buy
so
many
books
and
pictures
and
how
could
he
afford
to
give
so
much
away
in
charity
for
it
was
known
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
relieved
the
families
of
the
other
singers
and
had
relieved
them
too
in
a
most
substantial
way
it
was
evident
that
he
had
means
but
if
he
had
means
why
did
he
sing
in
the
choir
this
question
was
the
alpha
and
omega
of
ail
that
concerned
him
it
was
asked
everywhere
and
by
everybody
but
no
one
could
answer
it
save
the
dean
who
was
not
to
be
approached
upon
the
subject
finally
however
people
grew
tired
of
forming
conjectures
which
were
neither
denied
nor
affirmed
and
becoming
accustomed
to
the
tenor
presence
amongst
them
they
ceased
as
a
regular
thing
to
discuss
his
affairs
but
this
was
not
the
case
until
a
story
had
been
circulated
about
him
which
was
generally
believed
although
nobody
knew
from
whence
it
emanated
he
was
according
to
the
story
the
illegitimate
son
of
an
actress
and
some
great
man
from
whom
he
inherited
his
aristocratic
appearance
and
a
small
income
his
mother
it
was
said
had
been
an
opera
singer
which
accounted
for
his
voice
and
shame
they
declared
on
the
discovery
of
his
birth
had
driven
him
into
his
present
retirement
and
caused
him
to
renounce
the
world
as
this
story
accounted
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
for
all
that
was
strange
about
him
it
was
regarded
in
every
respect
as
authentic
and
after
the
wickedness
of
titled
men
and
the
frailty
of
acting
women
had
been
freely
commented
upon
with
much
sage
shaking
of
the
head
as
if
only
titled
men
were
wicked
and
acting
women
frail
and
morningquest
itself
was
a
saintly
city
innocent
of
any
deed
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
its
word
the
matter
was
allowed
to
drop
and
the
tenor
was
left
to
gang
his
ain
gait
which
he
would
have
done
in
any
case
probably
but
which
he
continued
to
do
in
a
quiet
earnest
regular
way
that
won
him
a
friendly
feeling
from
most
men
and
more
than
his
share
of
sympathy
and
attention
from
the
good
women
who
had
not
enough
to
be
wounded
by
his
indifference
unsophisticated
little
maidens
just
budding
into
womanhood
would
peep
after
him
shyly
from
the
houses
sometimes
and
would
feel
in
their
tender
little
hearts
a
gentle
pity
for
one
who
was
so
handsome
and
so
unfortunate
like
the
true
hero
of
romance
he
was
believed
by
them
to
be
supremely
unhappy
and
all
they
asked
was
to
be
allowed
to
comfort
him
but
he
noticed
none
of
them
and
so
the
little
maidens
blushed
at
first
for
having
thought
of
him
at
all
and
then
forgot
him
for
somebody
else
or
if
the
somebody
else
did
not
come
quickly
they
began
to
regard
the
tenor
with
a
totally
different
feeling
almost
as
if
he
had
wronged
them
in
some
way
but
the
tenor
continued
to
gang
his
ain
gait
and
was
alike
indifferent
to
their
pity
or
their
spite
his
little
house
like
most
of
those
in
the
close
had
an
old
walled
garden
behind
it
a
large
garden
for
the
size
of
the
house
and
so
sheltered
that
many
things
grew
there
which
would
not
grow
elsewhere
in
the
open
the
house
itself
was
picturesque
on
that
side
having
a
bright
south
aspect
favourable
to
the
growth
of
creepers
with
which
it
was
thickly
covered
jasmine
clematis
honeysuckle
and
roses
succeeding
each
other
in
their
regular
order
and
the
garden
was
always
full
of
flowers
it
was
here
that
the
tenor
spent
much
of
his
time
hard
at
work
he
had
evidently
a
passion
for
flowers
and
was
a
most
successful
gardener
the
conservatory
and
orchid
house
which
he
had
had
built
soon
after
his
arrival
being
always
lovely
even
in
the
winter
the
building
of
these
two
houses
was
considered
an
extravagance
and
had
caused
the
close
to
point
the
finger
at
him
for
a
while
but
when
someone
declared
that
the
unfortunate
tenor
had
probably
inherited
much
of
his
recklessness
and
was
not
therefore
responsible
as
other
people
were
the
suggestion
was
considered
reasonable
enough
and
from
that
time
forward
the
tenor
expensive
tastes
were
held
to
be
separate
matter
for
commiseration
the
truth
being
that
morningquest
could
not
bear
to
be
on
bad
terms
with
the
tenor
and
would
have
found
an
excuse
for
him
had
he
outraged
the
best
preserved
prejudices
it
ever
held
it
was
only
necessary
to
glance
at
the
tenor
books
to
perceive
that
he
was
a
student
many
valuable
works
in
many
languages
were
scattered
about
his
house
and
it
was
a
fact
that
he
spent
much
of
his
leisure
in
poring
over
these
to
what
end
his
studies
might
be
directed
no
one
of
course
could
tell
but
it
was
assumed
that
he
had
acquired
a
respectable
amount
of
knowledge
from
the
fact
that
the
dean
himself
a
learned
man
delighted
not
a
little
in
his
conversation
when
this
fact
had
been
fully
ascertained
by
careful
observation
smouldering
curiosity
blazed
up
afresh
and
surmise
was
once
more
busy
with
the
tenor
name
did
he
write
for
the
magazines
they
wondered
it
seemed
likely
enough
for
it
was
notorious
in
morningquest
that
people
who
did
that
kind
of
thing
were
not
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
it
soon
came
to
pass
that
certain
articles
relating
to
various
things
such
as
drainage
deep
sea
fishery
the
coinage
of
greece
competitive
examinations
in
china
and
essays
on
other
subjects
likely
to
interest
an
artistic
man
were
confidently
assumed
to
be
his
and
the
shy
little
girls
in
the
houses
who
never
looked
at
anything
in
the
magazines
but
the
pictures
and
the
poetry
were
wont
to
credit
him
with
certain
passionate
lays
from
which
they
got
quite
new
ideas
of
eyes
and
dies
and
sighs
and
other
striking
rhymes
to
musical
metres
which
made
their
little
hearts
throb
pleasurably
but
nothing
more
definite
was
known
of
the
tenor
labours
than
was
known
of
anything
else
concerning
him
and
fortunately
for
himself
there
was
that
in
his
bearing
which
preserved
him
from
being
personally
annoyed
by
impertinent
curiosity
so
that
he
was
most
probably
pretty
nearly
the
only
person
in
the
city
who
had
no
idea
of
the
interest
he
himself
excited
two
years
had
glided
by
in
great
apparent
tranquillity
since
the
day
the
tenor
entered
the
choir
two
years
during
which
he
had
trodden
the
path
of
life
so
uprightly
and
so
purely
that
not
even
a
suspicion
of
was
ever
breathed
against
him
by
gentle
or
simple
good
or
bad
it
was
a
calm
and
passionless
existence
that
he
led
the
life
of
an
ascetic
but
of
a
cultivated
ascetic
devoted
to
the
highest
intellectual
pursuits
and
actuated
by
the
belief
that
their
value
consisted
not
in
their
market
price
nor
in
the
amount
of
attention
called
fame
which
they
might
attract
to
himself
but
in
the
pleasure
they
gave
and
in
the
good
they
did
many
a
weary
man
whose
life
had
been
wasted
in
the
toil
of
bringing
himself
before
the
world
when
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
his
ambition
might
well
have
envied
the
tenor
his
placid
countenance
and
untroubled
lot
some
might
even
have
perceived
that
there
was
more
of
poetry
than
of
commonplace
in
the
quiet
life
which
glided
on
so
evenly
soothed
by
the
cathedral
services
cheered
by
the
chime
and
guarded
by
the
shadow
of
its
gray
protecting
walls
the
tenor
cheeks
had
been
haggard
and
worn
when
he
first
settled
in
morningquest
and
dark
circles
round
his
eyes
had
betokened
sleepless
nights
and
the
ceaseless
gnawing
ache
of
a
great
grief
but
all
that
had
passed
as
the
days
wore
on
giving
place
to
a
settled
expression
of
peace
peace
tinged
with
a
certain
sadness
but
dignified
by
resignation
gradually
too
although
he
remained
slender
he
ceased
to
be
emaciated
and
his
cheeks
assumed
a
healthy
hue
that
very
well
became
them
chapter
ii
it
was
thought
at
first
that
the
dean
intimacy
with
the
new
tenor
arose
from
a
sense
of
duty
sharpened
by
the
feeling
of
with
which
he
had
regarded
his
fancied
neglect
of
the
old
one
but
however
that
might
have
been
it
was
continued
from
a
genuine
liking
for
the
man
himself
no
one
in
morningquest
knew
the
tenor
half
so
well
as
the
dean
did
no
one
could
have
had
a
truer
regard
for
him
or
watched
the
passing
of
his
trouble
with
more
affectionate
interest
or
noted
the
change
for
the
better
which
had
been
wrought
by
the
regular
occupation
of
those
peaceful
days
with
greater
satisfaction
the
dean
knew
the
tenor
story
so
that
their
relations
might
be
called
confidential
but
for
two
years
no
allusion
had
been
made
by
either
of
them
to
the
past
neither
had
any
plans
been
formed
for
the
future
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
the
dean
noticed
signs
of
awakening
energy
in
his
friend
the
tenor
performed
his
duties
less
mechanically
his
apathy
was
broken
by
fits
of
restlessness
he
had
found
the
mornings
long
lately
he
had
thought
the
afternoons
objectless
and
when
evening
came
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
he
wearied
of
his
books
and
music
and
chafed
a
little
for
something
not
change
exactly
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
desire
and
this
he
only
felt
at
times
a
desire
for
some
trifling
human
interest
which
should
make
the
life
he
was
leading
fuller
he
had
awakened
in
fact
from
his
long
lethargy
and
found
himself
alone
the
dean
of
morningquest
was
a
remarkable
man
he
had
the
fine
physique
the
and
the
scholarly
reputation
common
to
that
order
of
divines
who
keep
up
the
dignity
of
the
church
without
doing
much
for
christianity
in
person
he
was
tall
but
stooped
from
the
shoulders
he
had
white
hair
a
fine
intellectual
face
fresh
and
with
that
young
look
in
it
which
has
been
called
and
is
only
seen
on
the
faces
of
those
in
whom
passion
has
not
died
a
natural
death
as
the
vital
powers
decay
but
has
been
brought
into
subjection
and
made
to
do
good
work
instead
of
evil
no
man
consorted
more
habitually
with
his
equals
or
seldomer
entertained
the
notion
that
there
were
such
people
in
the
world
as
his
inferiors
he
practised
his
religion
to
the
last
letter
of
church
law
and
worshipped
christ
the
son
of
god
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
turned
his
exclusive
back
on
christ
the
carpenter
son
and
had
him
prosecuted
for
an
impostor
had
he
presented
himself
with
no
better
pedigree
he
could
tell
the
story
of
the
saviour
sufferings
with
infinite
pathos
because
he
knew
who
the
saviour
was
but
he
could
not
have
told
the
same
story
with
the
same
power
had
the
hero
of
it
been
merely
one
common
man
sacrificing
his
life
for
others
what
affected
the
dean
was
the
enormous
condescension
it
was
the
greatness
of
the
man
not
the
greatness
of
the
deed
that
appealed
to
him
a
poor
tradesman
might
sacrifice
his
life
nobly
also
but
then
what
is
the
life
of
a
tradesman
comparatively
speaking
people
called
the
dean
proud
and
worldly
wise
but
this
was
not
true
of
him
he
may
have
believed
that
all
the
people
of
palestine
belonged
to
county
families
and
were
therefore
called
the
chosen
people
but
he
never
said
so
a
certain
gentle
humility
of
demeanour
always
distinguished
him
no
matter
to
whom
he
spoke
and
he
was
without
doubt
a
thoroughly
good
nineteenth
century
churchman
living
at
his
own
level
of
course
and
true
to
his
caste
toward
the
weaknesses
of
which
he
exercised
much
charity
and
forbearance
while
he
expressed
his
condemnation
of
its
sins
by
rigorously
excluding
from
his
family
circle
any
member
of
it
who
had
been
openly
convicted
of
disgraceful
conduct
just
as
he
excluded
professional
men
and
other
common
citizens
when
they
held
no
official
position
which
he
was
obliged
to
recognize
and
were
not
connected
with
the
landed
gentry
but
these
were
the
characteristics
of
his
position
for
as
a
dean
he
was
required
to
be
the
slave
of
precedent
as
a
man
however
he
was
known
to
be
just
and
generous
and
an
excellent
good
friend
to
all
who
had
any
claim
upon
him
from
the
bishop
who
governed
him
down
to
the
humblest
chorister
in
the
cathedral
which
he
governed
it
was
in
the
early
spring
when
the
dean
first
noticed
what
he
took
to
be
a
change
for
the
better
in
the
tenor
attitude
toward
life
at
large
the
dean
was
susceptible
himself
to
kindly
changes
in
the
season
so
much
so
indeed
that
contrary
to
all
precedent
he
allowed
himself
to
be
tempted
out
after
dark
one
night
into
the
close
by
the
balmy
mildness
of
the
weather
his
mind
had
been
running
all
day
upon
the
tenor
and
noticing
as
he
passed
his
little
house
that
the
blind
was
up
and
the
sitting
room
window
wide
open
showing
the
lamplit
interior
and
the
object
of
his
thoughts
pacing
restlessly
to
and
fro
he
determined
to
go
in
and
have
a
chat
the
tenor
received
him
cordially
but
his
manner
was
somewhat
absent
and
for
a
wonder
the
conversation
flagged
are
you
well
the
dean
asked
at
last
you
look
somewhat
fatigued
i
think
and
pale
yes
i
am
well
thank
you
the
tenor
answered
brushing
his
hand
back
over
his
forehead
and
hair
a
gesture
which
was
habitual
but
i
fancy
he
added
smiling
that
i
am
beginning
to
be
a
little
he
did
not
know
what
ah
said
the
dean
looking
at
him
with
the
grave
critical
air
of
an
anxious
physician
and
ruminating
before
he
pronounced
his
diagnosis
you
have
shown
most
extraordinary
perseverance
in
the
course
of
life
you
marked
out
for
yourself
he
finally
observed
and
i
trust
your
resolution
is
well
recompensed
by
having
obtained
for
you
that
peace
of
mind
which
you
sought
but
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
be
permitted
to
point
out
to
you
i
do
not
venture
to
advise
because
in
the
first
place
it
is
always
a
difficult
matter
to
decide
on
what
would
be
best
for
another
man
welfare
and
in
the
second
the
dean
always
spoke
with
great
deliberation
a
man
who
has
proved
himself
so
capable
of
acting
with
prudence
and
determination
so
competent
to
judge
and
so
firm
in
carrying
out
his
convictions
as
you
have
been
might
well
consider
advice
from
anyone
presumptuous
and
therefore
i
am
merely
going
to
observe
that
lately
it
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
pity
that
your
life
should
continue
much
longer
to
be
a
life
of
inaction
i
hope
and
indeed
i
think
that
the
years
you
have
spent
so
well
in
this
quiet
way
have
been
even
more
beneficial
than
you
yourself
imagine
that
they
have
not
only
reconciled
you
to
life
but
have
given
you
back
the
confidence
and
energy
which
should
belong
to
your
character
and
abilities
and
the
ambition
to
succeed
in
the
world
which
should
belong
to
your
age
for
some
time
past
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
you
are
more
restless
than
you
used
to
be
and
i
have
fancied
indeed
i
may
say
i
have
hoped
that
you
are
at
last
beginning
to
long
for
change
the
tenor
sat
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
while
no
he
began
at
last
i
do
not
even
yet
long
for
change
as
you
would
understand
the
longing
i
have
begun
to
feel
a
want
though
i
scarcely
know
of
what
of
companionship
perhaps
of
some
new
interest
but
i
have
no
inclination
for
any
change
that
would
take
me
away
from
here
after
the
storm
i
passed
through
this
place
has
been
for
me
a
perfect
haven
of
rest
and
now
that
my
peace
of
mind
has
returned
to
me
do
you
think
it
would
be
wise
by
any
voluntary
act
to
alter
the
present
course
of
my
life
seeing
that
it
is
so
well
with
me
as
it
is
when
a
man
is
content
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
any
change
can
be
for
the
better
and
trifles
apart
i
really
am
content
god
grant
it
may
last
the
dean
responded
earnestly
only
i
would
warn
you
to
be
ready
for
change
in
case
it
comes
to
you
in
spite
of
yourself
i
would
warn
you
not
to
feel
too
secure
for
i
have
noticed
this
that
for
some
mysterious
reason
which
no
mortal
can
fathom
it
appears
to
be
the
will
of
heaven
that
when
a
man
is
able
to
say
sincerely
am
happy
when
he
is
most
confident
believing
his
happiness
to
be
as
firmly
placed
as
earthly
happiness
can
be
then
is
the
time
for
him
to
be
most
watchful
for
then
is
change
most
likely
to
be
at
hand
indeed
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
this
feeling
of
security
or
rather
of
content
with
things
as
they
are
is
in
itself
an
indication
of
coming
change
as
he
finished
speaking
the
cathedral
clock
above
them
began
to
strike
the
hour
slowly
the
mellow
notes
followed
each
other
filling
the
night
with
sound
and
dying
away
in
a
long
reverberation
when
the
twelfth
had
struck
then
came
silence
then
the
chime
voicelike
clear
and
resonant
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
after
which
all
was
so
still
that
the
tenor
looking
up
through
the
open
window
at
the
moonlit
cathedral
towering
above
him
gray
shadowy
and
mysterious
felt
as
if
the
world
itself
had
stopped
and
all
the
life
in
it
had
been
resolved
into
a
moment
of
intense
of
illimitable
passionate
yearning
for
something
not
to
be
expressed
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
in
the
afternoon
the
tenor
had
to
sing
chapter
iii
there
is
human
nature
both
literally
and
figuratively
speaking
in
wagner
method
of
setting
a
character
to
a
tune
of
its
own
for
although
our
lives
can
hardly
be
said
to
order
themselves
to
one
consistent
measure
our
days
often
do
for
months
now
when
the
orb
of
day
departs
schubert
song
had
accompanied
the
tenor
it
had
soothed
him
it
had
irritated
him
it
had
expressed
passionate
longing
it
had
been
the
utterance
of
despairing
apathy
it
had
marked
the
vainest
regret
and
it
had
suggested
hope
it
had
wearied
him
it
had
comforted
him
but
it
had
never
left
him
that
saturday
morning
however
when
he
awoke
his
mind
was
set
to
another
measure
schubert
song
had
gone
as
it
had
come
without
conscious
effort
on
his
part
but
it
had
left
a
substitute
for
the
tenor
as
he
lingered
over
his
morning
work
found
himself
continually
murmuring
whole
phrases
of
a
chant
which
he
had
heard
once
upon
a
time
when
he
was
staying
in
an
old
town
in
france
it
was
the
litany
of
the
blessed
virgin
sung
at
benediction
by
some
unseen
singer
with
a
wonderfully
sympathetic
voice
the
tenor
had
gone
again
and
again
to
hear
her
in
this
chant
the
music
of
which
suited
her
as
well
as
it
did
the
theme
the
words
of
adoration
sancta
maria
sancta
dei
genetrix
sancta
virgo
virginum
were
uttered
evenly
on
notes
that
admitted
of
the
tenderest
expression
while
the
supplication
the
ora
pro
nobis
rose
to
the
full
compass
of
the
singer
voice
and
was
delivered
in
tones
of
passionate
entreaty
at
the
end
in
the
agnus
dei
the
music
changed
dropping
into
the
minor
with
impressive
effect
the
effect
of
earnestness
wearied
by
effort
but
still
unshaken
and
it
was
this
final
appeal
in
all
its
pathetic
beauty
that
now
recurred
to
the
tenor
he
had
not
thought
of
the
chant
for
years
nor
had
there
been
anything
apparently
to
recall
it
now
but
all
that
day
it
possessed
him
and
at
intervals
he
caught
himself
involuntarily
singing
it
aloud
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
parce
nobis
domine
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mimdi
exaudi
nos
domine
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
miserere
nobis
he
sang
it
while
he
was
dressing
he
whistled
it
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
while
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
waiting
for
his
breakfast
and
at
breakfast
with
the
newspaper
before
him
he
hummed
it
to
himself
steadily
he
began
it
again
as
he
crossed
the
road
to
enter
the
cathedral
for
the
early
morning
service
he
continued
it
while
he
was
putting
on
his
surplice
he
marched
to
it
in
the
procession
and
he
rapped
it
out
on
his
music
book
when
he
had
taken
his
seat
in
the
choir
he
opened
the
book
to
study
his
solo
for
the
afternoon
service
but
before
he
was
halfway
through
his
mind
was
busily
rendering
not
the
music
before
him
but
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
parce
nobis
domine
the
haunting
strain
had
become
an
intolerable
nuisance
by
this
time
and
he
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
get
rid
of
it
by
giving
his
mind
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
interesting
himself
in
the
people
as
they
entered
and
took
their
places
in
stall
and
choir
and
canon
pew
chancel
and
transept
being
saturday
there
was
a
good
attendance
even
at
this
early
service
strangers
from
a
distance
came
in
to
see
the
cathedral
and
people
in
the
place
came
in
to
see
the
strangers
so
that
there
was
plenty
to
observe
especially
for
one
who
unlike
the
tenor
was
a
little
behind
the
scenes
or
had
peeped
beneath
the
surface
and
beheld
the
various
incidents
of
the
which
were
constantly
being
enacted
in
the
sacred
edifice
itself
from
service
to
service
in
the
midst
and
with
the
help
of
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
prayers
and
sermons
under
the
dean
very
nose
and
often
in
the
presence
of
the
bishop
the
world
at
worship
is
a
worldly
sight
and
there
was
a
certain
appropriateness
in
the
tenor
but
he
failed
to
apply
it
although
it
kept
him
company
to
the
end
and
was
still
faithful
when
he
sallied
forth
from
the
gloom
of
the
cathedral
and
went
on
his
way
with
the
rest
in
the
sunshine
and
freshness
of
a
glad
new
day
as
the
time
for
the
afternoon
service
approached
the
people
began
again
to
flock
to
the
cathedral
but
in
crowds
now
for
it
had
been
rumoured
that
the
tenor
was
to
sing
the
choir
from
their
lateral
position
on
either
side
of
the
aisle
were
able
to
look
up
and
down
the
church
having
on
the
one
hand
and
opposite
the
distinguished
visitors
who
were
accommodated
with
seats
in
the
stalls
the
canon
and
dean
pews
and
on
the
other
the
officiating
clergy
and
the
congregation
generally
it
was
an
advantageous
position
for
those
who
came
to
observe
but
the
tenor
had
not
hitherto
been
one
of
these
the
music
when
it
was
interesting
absorbed
him
and
when
it
was
dull
the
monotony
soothed
him
so
that
he
noticed
nothing
it
had
done
so
this
afternoon
during
all
the
first
part
of
the
service
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
but
did
his
work
mechanically
like
one
in
a
dream
and
in
every
pause
of
it
the
old
chant
recurred
to
him
filling
his
heart
with
a
separate
undercurrent
of
solemn
supplication
now
in
french
agneau
de
dieu
qui
effacez
les
péchés
du
monde
ayez
pitié
de
nous
and
now
in
latin
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
miserere
nobis
the
dean
preached
a
on
saturday
afternoon
which
he
took
the
precaution
to
deliver
before
the
anthem
so
that
the
people
might
still
have
something
to
look
forward
to
and
keep
their
seats
the
over
the
organ
played
the
opening
bars
of
the
solo
and
the
choir
stood
up
while
he
waited
for
the
note
the
tenor
absently
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
lady
in
the
canon
pew
the
spell
of
the
old
chant
was
still
upon
him
and
instead
of
preparing
his
mind
for
his
task
he
let
it
murmur
on
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
parce
nobis
domine
while
a
rapt
silence
fell
upon
the
congregation
not
a
ribbon
rustled
the
expression
of
expectation
was
most
intense
one
would
scarcely
have
expected
the
tenor
to
take
up
the
note
at
the
right
moment
his
mind
being
preoccupied
by
another
strain
but
he
did
the
lady
in
the
canon
pew
held
the
music
of
the
anthem
before
her
and
had
been
following
that
but
when
the
first
clear
notes
of
the
tenor
voice
rang
through
the
building
she
looked
up
as
if
in
surprise
their
eyes
met
and
with
a
shock
the
tenor
awoke
from
his
lethargy
faltered
for
a
moment
and
then
stopped
the
organ
played
on
however
and
he
quickly
recovered
but
the
pause
had
been
quite
perceptible
and
the
people
were
amazed
it
was
the
first
time
that
such
a
thing
had
happened
with
their
tenor
which
made
it
a
matter
of
moment
and
the
wonder
of
it
grew
parties
being
formed
the
one
to
excuse
the
slip
and
call
it
nothing
the
other
to
blame
him
for
his
carelessness
as
people
who
never
disappoint
us
are
blamed
with
bitterness
if
for
once
by
chance
they
err
that
night
the
tenor
restlessness
grew
to
a
head
he
was
engaged
upon
a
piece
of
work
he
wished
to
finish
but
he
could
not
settle
to
it
and
after
making
an
ineffectual
effort
to
concentrate
his
attention
upon
it
he
took
up
his
hat
and
strolled
out
it
was
a
lovely
moonlight
night
the
line
of
trees
in
the
close
were
in
flower
and
their
sweetness
was
overpowering
he
did
not
stay
there
however
but
wandered
out
into
the
city
with
his
hat
pushed
back
from
his
forehead
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
gas
was
not
lighted
in
the
streets
as
the
moon
was
near
the
full
and
beneath
her
rays
all
common
objects
however
obtrusively
vulgar
by
daylight
were
refined
into
beauty
for
the
moment
pater
de
coelis
deus
miserere
nobis
fili
redemptor
mundi
deus
miserere
nobis
spiritus
sancte
deus
miserere
nobis
sancte
trinitas
unus
deus
miserere
nobis
the
tenor
sang
softly
to
himself
as
he
slowly
pursued
his
way
he
had
some
sort
of
a
vague
idea
that
he
would
like
to
go
and
look
at
the
quaint
old
by
moonlight
and
when
he
reached
it
he
stopped
at
the
corner
interrupting
his
song
to
gaze
in
artistic
appreciation
at
the
silent
scene
before
him
at
the
heavy
masses
of
shade
interspersed
with
intervals
of
mellow
moonlight
and
the
angles
of
roof
and
spire
and
ornament
cut
clean
as
cameos
against
the
dark
and
radiant
clarity
of
the
beautiful
night
sky
the
was
an
irregular
square
picturesquely
enclosed
by
tall
houses
of
different
heights
and
most
original
construction
among
them
the
east
end
of
a
church
and
part
of
a
public
building
of
ancient
date
were
crowded
in
without
incongruous
effect
however
the
moonlight
crisp
cool
and
clear
having
melted
hue
and
form
of
all
alike
into
one
harmonious
whole
to
the
charm
of
which
even
the
covered
stalls
used
in
the
day
dealings
and
now
packed
in
the
middle
of
the
square
and
the
deserted
footways
added
something
a
tall
slender
lad
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
pathway
just
in
front
of
the
tenor
he
was
the
only
other
person
about
and
on
that
account
the
tenor
had
looked
at
him
a
second
time
as
he
did
so
a
young
woman
came
suddenly
round
the
corner
and
accosted
the
boy
est
beau
she
exclaimed
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
smiling
up
into
his
face
admiringly
the
boy
stepped
back
to
avoid
her
with
an
unmistakable
gesture
of
disgust
and
in
doing
so
he
accidentally
stumbled
up
against
the
tenor
he
turned
round
and
apologised
confusedly
the
tenor
raised
his
hat
and
answered
courteously
they
were
standing
together
side
by
side
now
and
remained
so
for
some
seconds
silently
surveying
the
scene
and
then
the
tenor
all
unconsciously
began
again
to
sing
sancta
maria
he
entreated
sancta
dei
genetrix
sancta
virgo
virginum
ora
pro
nobis
the
girl
had
been
wandering
off
again
but
at
the
first
note
of
the
supplication
she
stopped
a
chord
of
memory
stirred
she
knew
the
words
she
knew
the
tune
she
had
sung
them
both
herself
often
and
often
at
home
in
france
she
was
a
child
of
mary
then
and
now
as
the
tenor
finished
the
last
note
of
the
phrase
and
paused
she
clasped
her
hands
convulsively
and
gasped
o
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
moi
her
cry
did
not
reach
the
tenor
and
the
boy
neither
had
they
observed
her
distress
for
just
at
that
moment
the
city
clock
struck
one
and
both
had
raised
their
heads
involuntarily
in
expectation
of
the
chime
and
presently
out
upon
the
night
it
rolled
a
great
wave
of
sound
swelling
and
spreading
muffled
by
distance
somewhat
but
still
distinctly
sweet
and
insistent
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
do
you
believe
it
said
the
boy
glancing
toward
the
girl
and
repeating
the
gesture
of
disgust
with
which
he
had
shrunk
from
her
when
she
accosted
him
the
tenor
lifted
his
hat
and
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
do
i
believe
it
in
spite
of
you
would
say
he
answered
considering
the
girl
with
quiet
eyes
yes
i
believe
it
he
declared
in
spite
of
which
has
puzzled
older
heads
than
yours
with
which
he
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
taking
up
the
litany
of
the
blessed
virgin
once
more
as
he
went
the
supplication
agnus
dei
qui
tollis
peccata
mundi
miserere
nobis
being
audible
long
after
he
was
out
of
sight
the
boy
remained
as
he
had
left
him
for
some
time
apparently
lost
in
thought
and
the
girl
still
stood
a
little
way
off
in
a
dejected
attitude
her
hands
clasped
before
her
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
she
looked
ill
and
spiritless
the
boy
glancing
at
her
carelessly
wondered
at
the
intent
expression
of
her
face
he
did
not
perceive
that
she
was
praying
but
she
was
the
midnight
stillness
deepened
about
those
two
there
was
not
another
living
creature
to
be
seen
the
irregular
old
buildings
on
every
side
looked
ruinous
in
the
shadowy
moonlight
and
the
whole
presented
to
the
boy
a
picture
of
desolation
which
chilled
him
he
was
about
to
turn
away
with
a
last
cursory
glance
at
the
other
solitary
figure
when
something
suddenly
occurred
which
arrested
his
attention
it
seemed
to
startle
him
too
for
he
sprang
back
with
prompt
agility
into
a
dark
doorway
behind
him
from
whence
he
watched
what
followed
with
the
keenest
interest
being
careful
however
to
conceal
himself
the
while
he
had
not
felt
any
movement
of
pity
or
kindly
compassion
for
the
girl
perfect
indifference
had
succeeded
the
first
sensation
of
repugnance
he
would
have
left
her
there
to
any
fate
that
might
await
her
and
would
have
expected
all
people
to
do
the
same
it
was
therefore
with
unmitigated
astonishment
that
he
beheld
the
scene
which
was
now
being
enacted
before
him
they
were
no
longer
alone
a
tall
and
graceful
lady
of
most
dignified
bearing
with
a
countenance
of
peculiar
serenity
and
sweetness
had
approached
from
the
opposite
direction
and
was
standing
beside
the
girl
speaking
to
her
evidently
but
the
boy
was
too
far
off
to
hear
what
was
said
he
could
see
however
that
the
girl
whole
attitude
had
changed
she
was
no
longer
dejected
but
eager
and
she
gazed
in
the
lady
face
as
she
listened
to
her
words
with
an
expression
of
admiration
and
wonder
one
had
almost
said
of
adoration
upon
her
own
as
though
it
were
a
heavenly
visitant
who
had
hailed
her
the
lady
as
she
spoke
pointed
to
a
street
opposite
and
the
girl
cast
a
quick
glance
in
that
direction
she
seemed
to
be
measuring
a
distance
she
was
impatient
to
traverse
and
moved
a
step
forward
at
the
same
time
uttering
some
short
sentence
with
rapid
gesticulation
the
pantomime
was
perfectly
intelligible
to
the
boy
who
understood
that
she
was
feverishly
anxious
to
carry
out
some
intention
on
the
instant
the
lady
seemed
to
hesitate
then
laying
her
beautiful
white
ungloved
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
and
looking
into
her
face
she
spoke
again
earnestly
the
girl
answered
with
passionate
protestations
and
then
the
lady
smiled
satisfied
apparently
and
led
the
way
in
the
direction
to
which
she
had
pointed
the
girl
following
in
haste
her
hat
had
fallen
back
her
hair
was
loosened
her
countenance
beamed
with
enthusiasm
as
the
boy
observed
he
was
stealing
softly
after
them
skipping
from
shadow
to
shadow
in
great
enjoyment
of
the
whole
adventure
the
lady
took
the
girl
to
a
long
low
rambling
house
beside
a
church
at
the
door
of
which
she
knocked
it
was
opened
immediately
by
a
singularly
venerable
looking
old
man
evidently
a
priest
with
a
fine
though
rugged
face
instinct
with
zeal
and
benevolence
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
was
just
coming
out
but
when
he
saw
who
had
knocked
he
stopped
short
and
bowed
deferentially
the
girl
sank
down
upon
the
doorstep
as
if
exhausted
i
have
brought
marie
cruchot
home
father
the
lady
said
ah
my
daughter
is
that
you
we
have
been
expecting
you
for
many
days
the
old
man
exclaimed
in
french
taking
the
girl
hand
and
raising
her
gently
as
he
spoke
i
have
prayed
for
you
day
and
night
without
ceasing
and
only
just
now
as
i
passed
the
convent
i
went
to
ask
the
night
portress
for
tidings
of
our
wandering
sheep
and
specially
mentioned
you
but
enter
the
good
sisters
are
waiting
for
you
and
will
welcome
you
with
joy
one
of
two
sisters
of
charity
who
were
standing
behind
the
priest
now
came
forward
and
kissed
the
girl
the
old
man
raised
his
hat
and
looking
up
into
the
clear
depths
of
the
quiet
sky
murmured
a
blessing
and
went
his
way
and
then
the
door
was
closed
humph
said
the
boy
who
was
lurking
up
an
entry
opposite
so
that
is
what
they
do
at
night
is
it
and
that
is
the
young
person
who
sold
her
sister
louise
to
mosley
menteith
now
i
am
beginning
to
know
the
world
and
what
an
extraordinary
old
world
it
is
to
be
sure
one
half
seems
to
be
always
kept
busy
mending
the
mischief
the
other
half
has
made
he
peeped
cautiously
out
of
the
entry
looking
for
the
lady
but
she
had
disappeared
and
night
and
silence
reigned
supreme
chapter
iv
all
that
the
tenor
had
witnessed
of
the
scene
in
the
made
little
or
no
impression
on
him
and
he
would
probably
never
have
thought
of
it
again
had
he
not
encountered
the
boy
a
few
nights
later
standing
idly
observant
as
before
at
the
same
time
and
almost
in
the
same
place
the
tenor
first
impulse
was
to
pass
on
without
speaking
but
the
boy
looked
at
him
and
there
was
something
in
the
look
half
shy
half
appealing
which
caused
him
to
stop
and
having
stopped
he
was
obliged
to
speak
to
his
first
commonplace
remark
the
boy
answered
nervously
and
with
quick
glances
instantly
averted
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
meet
the
tenor
eyes
the
latter
continued
to
talk
however
and
after
a
little
the
timidity
wore
off
and
his
manner
became
assured
this
is
a
curious
old
place
is
it
not
he
remarked
and
curiously
named
if
you
consider
how
very
little
there
is
for
here
for
the
new
day
which
would
bring
the
light
of
truth
after
the
darkness
of
error
it
never
struck
me
that
the
name
could
have
any
allegorical
significance
the
tenor
answered
prosaically
i
believe
it
used
to
be
morn
and
quest
it
stands
at
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
you
know
or
rather
just
below
it
they
run
their
united
race
from
hence
to
the
sea
i
know
said
the
boy
but
it
really
is
a
romantic
old
place
especially
by
moonlight
and
it
teems
with
historical
associations
as
the
guidebook
has
it
with
its
cathedral
cloisters
castle
and
close
the
closest
in
england
they
say
do
you
feel
remote
from
the
world
when
you
get
in
there
and
the
four
old
gates
are
shut
upon
you
the
is
the
most
interesting
to
me
two
of
the
others
are
architecturally
beautiful
where
they
have
been
spoilt
by
restoration
the
tenor
rejoined
ah
the
boy
ejaculated
and
then
continued
boyishly
you
not
a
native
evidently
or
you
would
speak
so
moderately
the
inhabitants
boast
themselves
black
in
the
face
about
everything
in
the
city
they
made
me
believe
that
the
whole
earth
began
here
originally
and
that
it
was
also
the
point
of
departure
for
the
sea
it
did
wash
their
walls
on
the
southern
side
once
upon
a
time
but
the
sinfulness
of
the
people
compelled
it
to
retire
ages
ago
and
it
has
since
enjoyed
a
purer
moral
atmosphere
twenty
miles
away
indeed
said
the
tenor
i
did
not
know
that
the
sea
was
so
fastidious
oh
yes
it
is
naturally
the
boy
declared
but
it
can
not
choose
its
position
for
itself
always
any
more
than
we
can
but
people
are
more
entertaining
than
places
he
pursued
do
you
think
so
now
these
people
how
godfearing
and
orthodox
they
are
and
how
admirably
they
make
religion
part
of
their
daily
life
in
the
matter
of
stretching
a
point
and
using
the
right
of
christian
charity
to
be
lenient
when
a
too
rigorous
adhesion
to
principle
would
injure
their
interest
their
chief
confectioner
retired
from
business
the
other
day
but
they
would
not
give
their
custom
to
his
successor
at
first
because
of
his
religious
opinions
they
forsook
him
for
his
atheism
in
fact
but
in
a
very
short
time
they
returned
to
him
for
his
which
are
excellent
if
you
ever
feel
any
doubt
about
life
being
worth
living
go
and
get
one
it
will
reassure
you
they
had
been
strolling
on
as
they
talked
and
now
the
tenor
turned
to
look
at
his
companion
being
about
to
answer
him
when
something
in
the
boy
face
struck
him
as
familiar
and
he
paused
knitting
his
brows
in
a
perplexed
effort
to
think
what
it
was
measured
beside
himself
the
boy
was
rather
taller
than
he
looked
but
very
slender
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
too
small
he
had
dark
eyebrows
peculiarly
light
luxuriant
hair
and
as
a
natural
accompaniment
a
skin
of
extreme
fairness
and
delicacy
in
fact
he
was
too
fair
for
his
age
it
made
him
look
effeminate
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
dark
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
his
colouring
would
have
been
insipid
as
it
was
however
there
was
no
lack
of
character
in
his
face
and
you
would
have
called
him
a
pretty
boy
while
thinking
it
high
time
he
had
grown
out
of
his
prettiness
this
was
the
tenor
reflection
but
his
too
earnest
gaze
apparently
disconcerted
the
boy
who
returned
it
with
one
quick
anxious
glance
then
seemed
to
fake
fright
and
finally
bolted
leaving
the
tenor
alone
in
the
road
that
young
rascal
is
out
without
leave
and
is
afraid
of
being
recognized
he
concluded
it
was
some
weeks
before
they
met
again
and
during
the
interval
the
tenor
often
thought
of
the
boy
with
curiosity
and
interest
there
was
something
unusual
in
his
manner
and
appearance
which
would
have
attracted
attention
even
if
his
conversation
had
not
been
significant
and
that
it
was
significant
the
tenor
discovered
by
the
continual
recurrence
to
his
mind
of
some
one
or
other
of
the
boy
observations
he
had
not
tried
to
find
out
who
the
boy
was
interest
not
having
stirred
his
characteristic
apathy
in
such
matters
to
that
extent
but
he
looked
for
him
continually
both
by
day
and
night
his
thoughts
being
pretty
equally
divided
between
him
and
the
lady
whose
brilliant
glance
had
had
such
a
magical
effect
upon
him
the
first
time
he
encountered
it
she
came
to
the
cathedral
regularly
now
and
always
sat
in
the
canon
pew
and
always
when
he
sang
she
looked
at
him
and
he
knew
that
the
look
was
an
expression
of
appreciation
and
thanks
he
knew
too
that
the
day
she
did
not
come
would
be
a
blank
day
for
him
chapter
the
moon
had
grown
old
but
the
nights
were
still
scented
by
the
when
the
tenor
met
the
boy
again
he
had
begun
to
believe
that
the
boy
did
not
live
in
morningquest
and
as
often
happens
he
was
thinking
of
him
less
than
usual
on
this
particular
occasion
and
hence
he
came
upon
him
unawares
the
boy
was
lolling
against
the
iron
railings
that
enclosed
the
grassy
space
round
which
the
old
grew
in
the
middle
of
one
arm
of
the
close
it
was
a
bright
clear
night
but
chilly
and
he
was
wrapped
up
in
a
greatcoat
which
lent
a
little
substance
to
his
slender
figure
the
tenor
would
have
passed
him
without
recognizing
him
but
for
his
sandy
hair
which
shone
out
palely
against
the
bark
of
one
of
the
trees
i
was
waiting
for
you
the
boy
said
why
are
you
so
late
how
do
you
know
i
am
later
than
usual
he
asked
because
generally
you
come
out
about
ten
and
it
is
nearly
twelve
now
how
do
you
happen
to
know
i
generally
come
out
about
ten
oh
the
boy
answered
coolly
i
watched
you
i
have
been
studying
your
habits
in
order
to
find
out
what
manner
of
man
you
are
and
i
think
do
he
added
patronizingly
with
a
wise
shake
of
the
head
i
guess
you
were
looking
for
me
too
were
you
the
tenor
smiled
again
and
lifting
his
hat
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
what
makes
you
think
so
he
asked
i
am
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
thing
the
boy
replied
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
people
who
meet
me
once
try
as
a
rule
to
cultivate
my
acquaintance
with
which
he
raised
himself
from
his
lolling
posture
and
added
i
walk
up
and
down
with
you
if
you
like
but
you
must
give
me
your
arm
i
require
support
why
are
you
tired
what
have
you
been
doing
the
tenor
asked
as
he
acquiesced
smiling
in
his
grave
way
for
the
boy
pleased
him
oh
well
considering
i
got
up
this
morning
that
was
a
serious
business
it
was
with
emphasis
for
i
had
to
settle
a
serious
question
before
i
arose
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
about
free
will
and
predestination
if
i
could
believe
in
predestination
i
thought
i
might
have
breakfast
in
bed
without
but
if
it
were
a
matter
of
free
will
i
felt
i
should
be
obliged
to
get
up
and
how
did
you
settle
it
the
tenor
asked
i
did
settle
it
the
boy
replied
for
just
as
i
was
coming
to
a
conclusion
the
breakfast
bell
rang
and
the
force
of
habit
compelled
me
to
jump
out
of
bed
in
a
hurry
i
do
call
free
will
and
i
think
on
the
whole
predestination
had
the
best
of
it
perhaps
for
my
breakfast
was
sent
up
to
me
after
all
without
any
action
on
my
part
and
i
partook
of
it
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
my
own
chamber
with
an
easy
conscience
and
the
luxuries
of
an
open
window
and
a
book
i
suppose
you
can
do
that
every
day
if
you
like
you
have
no
one
to
interfere
with
you
i
have
no
one
to
interfere
with
me
the
tenor
repeated
thoughtfully
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
me
if
i
had
by
better
you
mean
happier
the
boy
responded
clasping
both
hands
round
the
tenor
arm
the
latter
looked
down
at
him
wondering
a
little
but
not
displeased
they
were
walking
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
just
then
and
could
not
see
each
other
faces
but
the
tenor
heart
warmed
more
and
more
to
this
curious
boy
and
he
pressed
the
hand
that
rested
on
his
arm
a
little
closer
it
was
a
long
time
since
the
grave
earnest
man
had
known
anyone
so
young
and
spontaneous
or
felt
a
touch
of
human
sympathy
and
in
both
he
found
refreshment
a
something
of
that
something
which
he
knew
he
needed
but
could
not
name
they
took
a
turn
up
and
down
in
silence
and
then
the
boy
began
again
boyishly
i
say
do
you
suffer
from
nerves
you
made
rather
a
bungle
of
it
the
other
day
did
you
you
mean
when
i
broke
down
in
that
anthem
were
you
there
where
did
you
sit
with
the
distinguished
strangers
of
course
i
did
not
see
you
did
you
look
behind
you
no
but
are
you
a
stranger
here
well
not
exactly
said
the
boy
with
a
great
affectation
of
candour
they
had
passed
out
into
the
open
now
and
the
tenor
could
see
the
face
he
had
glanced
at
him
as
we
do
at
the
person
we
speak
to
but
something
he
saw
arrested
his
glance
and
caused
him
to
look
again
keenly
and
closely
the
something
that
had
perplexed
him
before
the
boy
returned
his
gaze
smiling
and
unabashed
she
put
you
out
she
he
asked
with
a
grin
verily
she
hath
eyes
at
least
i
been
told
so
but
i
am
no
judge
of
such
things
myself
the
puzzled
look
passed
from
the
tenor
face
i
know
what
it
is
he
said
you
are
exactly
like
her
the
boy
laughed
i
meant
to
keep
it
a
secret
i
was
going
to
make
a
mystery
of
myself
he
said
but
faculties
like
yours
are
not
to
be
baffled
and
since
you
have
observed
so
much
i
might
as
well
confess
that
there
are
two
of
us
twins
they
call
us
the
heavenly
twins
what
signs
of
the
zodiac
said
the
tenor
no
signs
of
the
times
said
the
boy
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
the
tenor
observed
i
should
hardly
have
thought
you
were
twins
except
for
the
likeness
your
sister
looks
older
than
you
do
well
you
see
she
so
much
more
depraved
said
the
boy
and
her
lovely
name
is
angelica
excuse
me
i
must
laugh
he
slipped
his
hand
from
the
tenor
arm
leant
his
back
against
a
railing
and
exploded
excuse
me
he
repeated
when
he
could
contain
himself
i
have
suffered
from
this
affliction
all
my
life
i
ca
help
laughing
so
it
seems
said
the
tenor
may
i
ask
what
provoked
this
last
attack
of
your
malady
before
he
could
answer
they
were
accosted
by
a
respectable
looking
man
a
small
farmer
from
a
distance
probably
who
was
making
the
most
of
a
rare
opportunity
by
trying
to
see
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
cathedral
in
the
dark
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
the
boy
was
all
gravity
in
a
moment
but
could
you
tell
me
what
flying
buttresses
are
a
sign
of
rain
said
the
boy
whereupon
the
tenor
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
shook
him
incontinently
for
a
moment
after
he
was
released
the
boy
seemed
to
be
overcome
by
astonishment
but
this
was
rapidly
succeeded
by
an
attack
of
the
malady
he
had
declared
to
be
congenital
apparently
brought
on
by
the
shock
of
the
chastisement
and
the
tenor
who
had
walked
on
a
little
way
with
the
countryman
answering
his
questions
left
him
laughing
all
over
he
waited
leaning
against
the
railing
until
the
tenor
returned
you
little
wretch
the
latter
began
that
right
do
make
a
stranger
of
me
the
boy
interrupted
treat
me
like
a
younger
brother
you
make
me
feel
that
i
have
succeeded
in
establishing
confidential
relations
between
us
which
is
what
i
want
the
tenor
was
about
to
reply
but
his
voice
was
drowned
by
a
sudden
clangour
of
the
bells
above
them
the
clock
struck
the
chime
rang
and
while
they
waited
listening
the
tenor
raised
his
hat
they
were
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
cloisters
looking
up
to
the
clock
tower
and
its
tapering
spire
which
surmounted
the
norman
façade
and
entrance
to
the
south
transept
i
must
go
the
boy
said
when
he
could
hear
himself
speak
will
you
not
come
in
to
my
house
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
wanting
in
hospitality
the
tenor
exclaimed
i
should
have
asked
you
before
i
live
close
by
i
should
be
so
glad
not
the
boy
interrupted
hastily
another
time
chapter
vi
when
next
the
tenor
saw
angelica
after
he
had
learnt
that
she
was
the
boy
sister
he
felt
that
a
new
interest
had
been
added
to
her
attractions
it
was
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
the
cathedral
as
usual
and
she
came
in
late
but
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
her
seat
she
looked
at
the
tenor
with
an
earnest
anxious
glance
that
reminded
him
of
her
brother
and
her
colour
deepened
the
boy
had
told
her
then
the
tenor
thought
and
he
was
glad
she
knew
that
they
had
met
it
was
a
bond
of
union
which
seemed
to
bring
her
nearer
he
noticed
now
how
like
in
feature
the
brother
and
sister
were
the
girl
looked
taller
as
well
as
older
and
was
altogether
on
a
larger
scale
her
figure
being
amply
developed
for
her
age
while
the
boy
was
fragile
to
a
fault
her
hair
was
dark
too
while
his
was
light
but
with
these
slight
differences
there
was
likeness
enough
to
show
that
they
were
twins
they
both
had
the
same
shaped
eyes
the
same
straight
dark
eyebrows
and
long
lashes
the
same
features
the
same
clear
skin
and
even
teeth
but
the
expression
was
different
there
was
never
any
devilment
in
the
girl
face
it
was
always
pale
and
tranquil
almost
to
sadness
as
the
tenor
saw
it
standing
out
in
fair
relief
against
the
dark
oak
carving
of
the
stalls
her
movements
were
all
made
too
with
a
certain
quiet
dignity
that
seemed
habitual
in
the
boy
on
the
contrary
there
was
no
trace
of
that
graceful
attribute
he
threw
himself
about
lolled
lollopped
and
gesticulated
with
as
much
delight
in
the
free
play
of
his
muscles
as
if
he
were
only
let
out
to
exercise
them
occasionally
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
always
be
at
daggers
drawn
with
dignity
but
such
a
slender
intellectual
creature
could
not
without
absurdity
acquire
the
ponderous
movements
and
weight
of
manner
of
smaller
wits
and
duller
brains
in
the
girl
quiescence
was
the
natural
outcome
of
womanly
reserve
in
the
boy
it
would
have
been
mere
affectation
his
lightness
and
brightness
were
his
great
charm
at
present
a
charm
however
which
was
much
enhanced
by
moments
of
thoughtfulness
which
gave
glimpses
of
another
nature
beneath
with
more
substantial
qualities
the
tenor
had
soon
perceived
that
he
was
not
all
mischief
romp
and
boyishness
all
that
was
on
the
surface
but
beneath
there
was
a
strong
will
at
work
with
some
purpose
or
the
tenor
was
much
mistaken
and
there
was
daring
and
there
was
originality
this
was
the
tenor
first
impression
and
further
acquaintance
only
confirmed
it
having
formed
his
opinion
of
the
boy
abilities
the
tenor
began
to
make
plans
for
his
future
and
the
selflessness
of
the
man
nature
showed
itself
in
nothing
more
clearly
perhaps
than
in
the
consideration
he
gave
to
the
lad
career
his
own
had
not
cost
him
so
much
as
a
thought
for
years
but
now
he
roused
himself
and
became
ambitious
all
at
once
for
the
boy
he
believed
that
there
was
the
making
of
a
distinguished
man
in
him
and
he
allowed
the
hope
of
being
able
to
influence
him
in
some
worthy
direction
to
become
as
much
a
part
of
his
daily
life
as
another
hope
had
become
a
hope
which
was
strongly
felt
but
not
yet
acknowledged
except
in
so
far
as
it
took
the
form
of
a
desire
to
see
her
and
made
known
its
presence
with
force
in
the
pang
of
disappointment
which
he
suffered
if
by
chance
she
failed
to
come
as
usual
to
the
service
on
saturday
afternoon
he
saw
in
the
girl
an
ideal
and
had
found
soul
enough
in
the
boy
to
make
him
eager
to
befriend
him
and
thus
into
the
tenor
life
two
new
interests
had
found
their
way
and
something
which
had
hitherto
been
wanting
to
make
the
music
of
it
perfect
was
heard
at
last
in
his
wonderful
voice
when
he
sang
chapter
vii
about
this
time
the
weather
changed
the
nights
were
wet
for
a
week
and
when
it
cleared
up
the
tenor
had
begun
to
do
some
work
for
the
dean
which
kept
him
at
home
in
the
evenings
so
that
he
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
the
boy
who
only
seemed
to
come
abroad
at
night
for
some
little
time
he
saw
his
sister
however
in
the
cathedral
regularly
once
a
week
and
always
she
gave
him
a
friendly
glance
by
which
his
days
were
rounded
as
by
a
blessing
and
he
felt
content
his
being
so
was
entirely
characteristic
another
man
in
his
place
would
have
lost
the
charm
of
the
present
in
anxiety
to
reach
some
future
which
should
be
even
more
complete
but
the
tenor
took
no
thought
for
the
morrow
each
day
as
it
came
was
a
joy
to
him
and
his
hopes
if
he
had
any
were
a
part
of
his
peace
the
work
he
was
doing
for
the
dean
was
interesting
he
was
making
drawings
to
illustrate
a
history
of
times
which
the
dean
was
writing
he
drew
well
and
with
great
facility
but
these
drawings
many
of
which
were
architectural
required
special
care
and
accuracy
with
the
closest
attention
to
detail
which
made
the
work
fatiguing
particularly
as
he
had
to
do
it
at
night
his
only
leisure
time
just
then
and
more
than
once
he
had
tired
himself
out
and
been
obliged
to
put
it
away
and
rest
on
one
of
these
occasions
instead
of
going
to
bed
he
stretched
himself
in
an
beside
the
open
french
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
cathedral
and
prepared
to
indulge
in
the
quiet
luxury
of
a
pipe
while
he
rested
his
weary
eyes
the
great
cathedral
towered
above
him
and
from
where
he
sat
the
tenor
caught
a
beautiful
glimpse
of
it
anglewise
of
the
south
transept
and
tower
and
spire
the
rich
perpendicular
windows
of
the
clerestory
the
bold
span
of
the
flying
buttresses
rising
out
of
the
plain
but
solid
norman
base
every
detail
of
which
he
knew
and
appreciated
it
was
a
fair
still
starry
night
without
and
the
light
air
that
blew
in
upon
him
was
sweet
and
refreshing
his
mind
wandered
from
subject
to
subject
a
sleepy
sign
as
he
smoked
and
presently
he
put
down
his
pipe
and
closed
his
eyes
he
thought
then
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
dreaming
and
in
his
dream
he
fancied
he
heard
himself
sing
this
is
a
queer
dream
he
was
conscious
of
saying
that
is
my
voice
exactly
i
have
often
wondered
how
it
sounded
to
other
people
and
now
i
am
listening
to
it
myself
which
is
strange
but
the
strangest
part
of
it
was
that
the
words
to
which
the
music
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
were
not
the
words
of
any
song
he
knew
but
that
expression
of
human
nature
which
contains
in
itself
some
of
the
grandest
harmony
in
the
language
these
our
actors
as
i
foretold
you
were
all
spirits
and
are
melted
into
air
into
thin
air
and
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
this
vision
the
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
the
solemn
temples
the
great
globe
itself
yea
all
which
it
inherit
shall
dissolve
and
like
this
insubstantial
pageant
faded
leave
not
a
wreck
behind
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
the
last
words
repeated
themselves
over
and
over
again
on
different
notes
and
in
another
key
each
time
and
with
such
powerful
emphasis
that
at
last
it
aroused
the
tenor
upon
whose
sleepy
brain
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
voice
but
a
violin
to
which
he
had
been
listening
dawned
gradually
while
his
trained
ear
further
recognized
the
tone
of
a
rare
instrument
and
the
touch
of
a
master
hand
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
oh
he
exclaimed
is
it
you
and
there
was
a
world
of
pleasure
in
the
exclamation
come
in
the
boy
who
was
standing
in
the
road
opened
the
little
garden
gate
and
entered
i
am
glad
you
have
relented
he
said
for
i
meant
to
play
until
i
had
softened
your
heart
and
had
persuaded
you
to
take
me
in
and
the
hope
deferred
was
making
me
sick
i
was
asleep
the
tenor
answered
why
did
you
come
in
you
must
have
known
you
would
be
welcome
here
is
an
sit
down
and
tell
me
why
do
we
only
meet
at
night
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
i
am
not
a
daylight
beauty
the
boy
declared
i
look
best
at
night
but
seriously
the
tenor
persisted
oh
my
tutor
you
know
sandhurst
exams
and
that
kind
of
thing
you
are
going
into
the
army
then
but
the
boy
smiling
put
the
question
by
the
easy
sensuous
side
of
his
nature
was
evidently
uppermost
and
when
that
was
the
case
it
was
so
natural
for
him
to
shirk
a
disagreeable
subject
that
the
tenor
had
not
the
heart
to
pursue
it
further
wo
you
take
your
hat
off
he
said
presently
the
boy
put
up
both
hands
to
it
my
head
a
queer
shape
he
said
tapping
it
you
wo
want
to
examine
it
phrenologically
will
you
no
the
tenor
answered
smiling
not
if
you
object
i
do
object
i
do
like
to
be
touched
the
tenor
still
smiling
watched
him
as
he
carefully
removed
his
hat
his
head
was
rather
a
peculiar
shape
it
was
too
broad
at
the
back
and
too
large
altogether
for
his
slight
frame
though
probably
the
thickness
of
his
fluffy
light
hair
which
stood
up
all
over
it
innocent
of
parting
as
the
tenor
own
added
considerably
to
this
last
defect
there
was
nothing
so
very
extraordinary
about
it
however
and
the
tenor
did
not
see
why
he
should
be
sensitive
on
the
subject
and
rather
suspected
that
the
boy
was
gravely
poking
fun
at
him
but
as
he
could
not
be
sure
of
this
and
would
not
have
hurt
his
feelings
for
the
world
he
forebore
to
make
any
remark
the
boy
glanced
round
the
room
what
a
wealthy
luxurious
fellow
you
are
he
observed
these
appearances
of
wealth
as
you
call
it
are
delusive
the
tenor
answered
i
just
happened
to
have
money
enough
to
furnish
my
house
when
i
came
here
but
i
am
a
very
poor
man
now
i
have
little
or
nothing
in
fact
but
my
salary
for
singing
in
the
choir
oh
said
the
boy
and
you
might
be
so
rich
with
your
voice
the
tenor
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
are
you
lazy
the
boy
demanded
no
he
answered
smiling
again
the
boy
kept
him
smiling
perpetually
what
is
it
then
why
do
you
work
well
i
do
work
the
tenor
answered
him
i
mean
why
do
you
make
money
oh
because
i
have
no
one
to
make
it
for
if
you
had
and
the
boy
leant
forward
eagerly
would
you
would
you
work
for
a
lady
who
loved
you
if
she
gave
herself
to
you
i
would
work
for
my
wife
said
the
tenor
are
you
engaged
the
boy
asked
there
seemed
no
limit
to
his
capacity
for
asking
the
tenor
shook
his
head
and
shook
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
at
the
same
time
are
you
in
love
the
boy
persisted
the
tenor
made
no
reply
to
this
impertinence
but
a
glow
spread
over
his
face
forehead
and
chin
and
throat
the
boy
whom
nothing
escaped
leant
back
satisfied
i
know
what
it
is
he
said
she
married
and
you
do
like
to
ask
her
to
run
away
with
you
i
expect
she
would
you
know
if
you
did
the
tenor
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
mirth
seemed
to
jar
on
the
boy
who
got
up
and
began
to
pace
about
the
room
frowning
and
dissatisfied
you
look
pale
the
tenor
said
have
you
been
ill
since
i
saw
you
no
yes
the
boy
answered
i
had
a
bad
cold
i
was
very
sorry
for
myself
the
tenor
took
up
his
violin
and
examined
it
where
did
you
study
he
asked
everywhere
was
the
ungraciously
vague
reply
i
wish
you
would
play
again
the
tenor
said
taking
no
notice
of
his
it
would
be
a
rare
treat
for
a
hermit
like
me
no
was
the
blunt
rejoinder
i
do
want
to
make
music
i
want
to
explore
well
make
yourself
at
home
the
tenor
said
humouring
him
me
at
home
the
boy
replied
confidential
relations
you
know
you
may
smoke
if
you
like
oh
thank
you
the
tenor
answered
politely
sitting
down
in
his
from
which
he
had
risen
to
look
at
the
violin
and
taking
up
his
pipe
again
the
boy
was
rummaging
about
now
and
finding
much
to
interest
him
he
presently
recovered
his
temper
and
began
to
banter
his
host
but
even
this
outlet
was
scarcely
sufficient
for
his
superfluous
life
and
energy
so
he
emphasized
his
remarks
by
throwing
a
stray
cushion
or
two
at
the
tenor
he
jumped
over
the
chairs
instead
of
walking
round
them
and
performed
an
occasional
or
pirouette
in
various
parts
of
the
room
when
these
innocent
amusements
palled
upon
him
he
took
up
his
violin
and
played
a
plaintive
air
to
which
he
chanted
there
was
a
merry
dromedary
waltzing
on
the
plain
dromedary
waltzing
dromedary
prancing
and
all
the
people
said
it
is
a
sign
of
rain
when
they
saw
the
good
beast
dancing
executing
grotesque
steps
himself
at
the
same
time
in
illustration
oh
boy
forbear
the
tenor
exclaimed
at
last
or
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
that
it
the
boy
responded
cheerfully
i
mean
to
be
life
or
death
to
you
after
this
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
and
his
chin
on
his
chest
looking
up
from
under
his
eyebrows
at
the
tenor
thoughtfully
it
was
an
interval
of
great
gravity
and
when
he
spoke
again
the
tenor
looked
for
something
serious
i
say
he
began
at
last
the
tenor
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
waited
interrogatively
i
say
i
hungry
the
tenor
looked
his
dismay
boys
always
are
you
know
the
youth
added
encouragingly
and
if
there
should
be
nothing
in
the
house
the
poor
tenor
ejaculated
i
go
and
see
he
returned
quite
crestfallen
there
nothing
he
said
at
least
nothing
but
bread
no
butter
even
i
do
believe
you
said
the
boy
rousing
himself
from
his
indolent
attitude
boy
you
must
say
you
do
believe
me
but
i
do
said
the
boy
i
do
believe
you
know
where
to
look
are
the
servants
out
yes
my
solitary
attendant
does
sleep
here
then
i
go
and
look
myself
oh
do
if
you
like
said
the
tenor
much
amused
and
thinking
the
boy
would
enjoy
himself
best
if
he
were
left
to
rummage
at
his
own
sweet
will
he
took
up
a
book
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
shining
hair
and
was
soon
absorbed
but
presently
he
was
startled
by
a
wild
cry
of
distress
from
the
kitchen
and
jumping
up
hastily
he
went
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
found
the
boy
standing
at
one
end
of
the
kitchen
clutching
a
vegetable
dish
and
gazing
with
a
set
expression
of
absolute
horror
at
some
object
quite
at
the
other
end
the
tenor
strained
his
own
eyes
in
the
same
direction
but
could
not
at
first
make
anything
out
at
last
however
he
distinguished
a
shining
black
thing
moving
which
proved
to
be
a
small
cockroach
well
you
a
baby
he
exclaimed
i
not
the
boy
snapped
it
an
idiosyncrasy
i
ca
bear
creepy
crawly
things
they
give
me
fits
i
begin
to
perceive
boy
that
you
have
a
reason
for
everything
the
tenor
observed
as
he
disposed
of
the
innocent
object
of
the
abhorrence
put
it
out
of
sight
the
latter
entreated
looking
nauseated
but
as
soon
as
the
tenor
had
accomplished
his
mandate
his
good
humour
returned
and
he
began
to
beam
again
what
a
duffer
you
are
he
said
taking
the
lid
off
the
dish
he
held
in
his
hand
you
have
no
imagination
you
never
lifted
a
dish
cover
why
i
found
a
dozen
eggs
fresh
for
i
broke
one
into
a
cup
to
see
and
here
are
a
whole
lot
of
cold
potatoes
it
does
sound
appetizing
cold
potatoes
and
raw
eggs
sound
it
is
sound
you
judge
by
in
matters
of
this
kind
just
you
wait
and
you
shall
see
smell
and
taste
well
if
it
please
you
the
tenor
answered
lazily
i
see
something
already
you
have
lighted
a
fire
yes
and
i
used
all
the
dry
sticks
said
the
boy
with
great
glee
wo
the
old
woman
when
she
comes
in
the
morning
the
tenor
returned
to
his
book
reflecting
as
he
prepared
to
resume
it
on
the
wonderful
provision
of
nature
which
endows
the
growing
animal
not
only
with
such
strong
instincts
of
but
with
the
power
to
gratify
them
and
to
take
itself
off
at
the
same
time
and
be
happy
in
so
doing
thus
saving
those
who
have
outgrown
these
natural
proclivities
from
some
of
their
less
agreeable
consequences
presently
a
hot
red
face
appeared
at
the
door
did
you
say
you
liked
your
eggs
turned
the
boy
wanted
to
know
i
did
say
but
i
do
if
you
frying
them
and
hard
or
soft
oh
soft
how
many
can
you
eat
at
least
the
tenor
returned
at
random
and
i
can
eat
three
with
great
gravity
that
will
make
nine
and
leave
three
for
your
breakfast
in
the
morning
i
daresay
you
wo
want
more
after
such
a
late
supper
i
do
think
i
should
myself
but
do
you
mean
me
to
understand
that
the
voracity
of
the
growing
animal
will
be
satisfied
with
less
than
i
can
eat
well
you
see
the
boy
explained
apologetically
the
heat
of
the
fire
has
taken
a
lot
out
of
me
but
the
waste
must
be
repaired
yes
but
the
expenditure
has
been
followed
by
a
certain
amount
of
exhaustion
and
the
power
to
repair
the
waste
has
yet
to
be
generated
it
will
come
as
a
sort
of
reaction
of
the
organs
which
can
only
set
in
after
a
proper
period
of
repose
a
sort
of
interregnum
of
their
energies
you
know
the
tenor
threw
back
his
golden
head
oh
boy
he
expostulated
make
me
laugh
again
do
please
the
boy
was
very
busy
for
the
next
ten
minutes
arranging
the
table
and
quite
in
his
element
cooing
as
he
proceeded
and
giving
little
muttered
reasons
to
himself
in
his
soft
contralto
voice
for
everything
he
did
that
voice
of
his
was
wonderfully
flexible
he
could
make
it
harsh
grating
gruffly
mannish
and
caressing
as
a
woman
at
will
but
the
tone
that
seemed
natural
to
it
was
the
deep
mellow
contralto
into
which
he
always
relapsed
when
not
thinking
of
himself
the
tenor
thought
it
hardly
rough
enough
for
a
boy
of
his
age
but
it
was
in
harmony
with
his
fragile
form
and
delicate
effeminate
features
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
flashed
through
his
mind
as
he
watched
him
now
coming
and
going
and
he
sighed
it
seemed
so
likely
and
felt
already
that
he
should
miss
the
boy
and
wondered
with
retrospective
how
he
had
managed
to
live
at
all
with
no
such
interest
a
son
of
the
morning
must
be
a
sybarite
the
boy
observed
entering
the
room
at
that
moment
so
i
bring
flowers
and
also
salad
just
cut
and
crisp
may
i
ask
how
you
knew
there
was
salad
in
my
garden
well
you
may
the
boy
responded
cheerfully
but
let
me
see
though
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
you
i
found
that
out
the
last
time
i
was
here
perhaps
you
do
know
that
i
came
i
wanted
to
discover
the
resources
of
the
place
so
i
took
advantage
of
your
temporary
absence
on
business
one
day
and
inspected
it
where
was
i
the
tenor
asked
you
were
busy
at
the
fire
insurance
office
opposite
do
you
mean
the
cathedral
boy
i
will
not
let
you
mock
the
boy
grinned
it
was
the
only
time
i
could
be
at
all
sure
of
you
he
pursued
you
were
going
to
sing
a
solo
i
saw
it
advertised
in
the
paper
and
laid
my
plans
accordingly
but
i
in
a
fright
i
thought
you
might
just
happen
to
feel
bad
and
be
obliged
to
come
out
and
catch
me
i
felt
that
strongly
when
i
was
picking
your
flowers
in
the
greenhouse
he
left
the
room
before
the
tenor
recovered
and
returned
with
a
tray
on
which
was
the
result
of
his
enterprise
if
you
do
like
eggs
and
potatoes
fried
as
i
fry
them
you
never
like
anything
again
in
this
world
he
asserted
confidently
helping
the
tenor
as
he
spoke
the
thing
is
to
have
the
dripping
boiling
to
begin
with
you
know
he
continued
i
only
give
you
two
eggs
at
a
time
then
plunge
them
in
and
as
they
brown
take
them
off
one
by
one
and
put
them
on
a
hot
dish
i
speaking
of
the
potatoes
now
but
do
cover
them
up
it
makes
them
flabby
and
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
them
crisp
they
really
are
good
said
the
tenor
but
he
had
overestimated
his
capacity
and
could
only
dispose
of
three
of
the
eggs
the
boy
was
disgusted
however
he
said
it
did
not
matter
since
he
was
there
to
sacrifice
himself
in
the
interests
of
science
and
preserve
the
balance
of
nature
by
eating
the
rest
himself
a
feat
he
accomplished
easily
now
this
is
what
i
call
good
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
he
observed
may
i
ask
which
is
the
beast
the
tenor
ventured
why
i
am
of
course
said
the
boy
did
you
ever
know
a
boy
who
half
a
beast
yes
it
is
all
a
matter
of
early
association
and
surroundings
well
if
you
knew
the
kind
of
moral
atmosphere
i
have
to
breathe
at
home
you
would
know
also
how
little
you
ought
to
expect
of
me
but
what
shall
we
drink
there
is
some
beer
i
believe
the
tenor
said
dubiously
burgundy
is
more
in
my
line
burgundy
a
boy
like
you
should
know
the
difference
a
like
me
would
probably
the
tenor
smiled
and
what
do
you
call
yourself
pray
a
man
he
asked
no
a
bright
particular
spirit
it
was
not
inappropriate
the
tenor
thought
and
he
got
up
it
does
not
often
happen
so
he
said
but
now
i
think
of
it
i
believe
i
have
some
burgundy
in
the
house
the
dean
sent
me
a
dozen
the
last
time
i
was
out
of
sorts
and
there
is
some
left
i
know
said
the
boy
it
is
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
on
the
left
hand
side
when
the
tenor
came
back
with
the
burgundy
the
boy
settled
himself
in
an
with
a
glass
on
the
table
beside
him
and
it
was
evident
that
his
mood
had
changed
he
was
thoughtful
for
a
little
sitting
with
solemn
eyes
looking
out
at
the
cathedral
opposite
there
was
only
one
lamp
left
alight
in
the
long
low
room
and
the
dimness
within
made
it
possible
to
see
out
into
the
clear
night
and
distinguish
objects
easily
when
i
look
out
at
that
great
pile
and
realize
its
antiquity
i
suffer
the
boy
said
at
last
do
you
know
what
it
is
the
awful
oppression
of
the
ages
the
tenor
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
he
said
i
never
see
you
at
church
i
should
think
not
the
boy
replied
still
speaking
seriously
you
never
see
anyone
but
angelica
the
tenor
flushed
why
do
you
never
speak
to
that
sweet
young
lady
the
boy
asked
tentatively
after
a
little
pause
i
how
could
i
i
fancy
you
ought
to
the
boy
went
on
endeavouring
to
draw
the
tenor
you
ca
expect
her
to
make
up
to
you
you
know
oh
boy
how
can
you
be
so
young
the
tenor
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
but
still
amused
the
boy
sipped
his
wine
and
gazed
into
the
glass
delighting
in
the
rich
deep
colour
i
should
think
she
would
be
delighted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
so
great
an
artist
he
said
the
tenor
bowed
ironically
may
i
ask
if
you
are
pursuing
your
investigations
as
to
what
manner
of
man
i
am
he
asked
well
yes
was
the
candid
rejoinder
i
was
i
suppose
you
think
that
you
ought
not
to
speak
without
an
introduction
well
say
i
gave
you
one
the
tenor
laughed
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
let
the
subject
drop
and
at
the
same
time
yielded
to
temptation
what
would
your
introduction
be
worth
he
asked
everything
the
boy
rejoined
i
am
on
excellent
terms
with
angelica
we
have
always
been
inseparable
and
i
get
on
with
her
capitally
and
not
so
easy
to
get
on
with
i
can
tell
you
he
added
as
if
taking
credit
to
himself
when
she
is
good
she
is
very
good
indeed
but
when
she
is
naughty
she
is
horrid
and
just
now
she
mostly
naughty
she
is
very
happy
the
interest
expressed
in
the
tenor
attitude
was
intensified
and
inquiry
came
into
his
eyes
she
is
not
very
happy
the
boy
pursued
with
extreme
deliberation
because
you
come
no
nearer
boy
you
are
romancing
the
tenor
said
with
a
shade
of
weariness
in
his
voice
i
am
not
the
boy
replied
i
know
all
that
angelica
thinks
and
it
is
of
you
hush
the
tenor
exclaimed
you
must
not
tell
me
but
she
i
will
not
allow
it
well
there
then
do
bite
said
the
boy
and
i
wo
tell
you
against
your
will
that
she
thinks
a
great
deal
about
you
this
in
order
to
get
it
out
before
the
tenor
could
stop
him
but
i
will
tell
you
on
my
own
account
that
i
do
know
the
woman
who
would
a
vivid
flush
suffused
the
tenor
face
and
he
turned
away
i
hope
you
never
say
things
like
that
to
your
sister
he
objected
after
a
time
the
boy
grinned
sometimes
i
do
he
said
only
they
generally
more
so
there
was
a
long
silence
after
this
during
which
the
tenor
changed
his
attitude
repeatedly
he
was
much
disturbed
and
he
showed
it
the
boy
made
a
great
pretence
of
sipping
his
wine
but
he
had
not
in
reality
taken
much
of
it
he
was
watching
the
tenor
and
it
was
curious
how
much
older
he
looked
while
so
engaged
the
tenor
must
have
noticed
the
change
in
him
which
was
quite
remarkable
giving
him
an
entirely
different
character
but
for
his
own
preoccupation
as
it
was
however
he
noticed
nothing
boy
he
began
at
last
in
a
low
voice
and
hesitating
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
the
boy
leant
forward
all
attention
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
will
not
say
anything
like
that
anything
at
all
about
me
to
to
angelica
the
boy
seemed
to
think
i
will
promise
he
slowly
decided
if
you
will
promise
me
one
thing
in
return
what
is
it
will
you
promise
to
tell
me
everything
you
think
about
her
the
tenor
laughed
you
might
as
well
the
boy
expostulated
i
got
to
look
after
you
both
and
see
that
you
do
make
fools
of
yourselves
the
youngness
of
people
in
love
is
a
caution
and
i
should
like
to
see
angelica
safely
settled
with
you
a
man
with
a
voice
like
yours
is
a
match
for
anyone
there
are
obstacles
of
course
but
they
can
be
got
over
if
you
will
trust
me
oh
you
impossible
child
the
tenor
exclaimed
it
is
you
who
are
impossible
the
boy
said
in
dudgeon
you
are
too
ideal
too
content
to
worship
from
afar
off
as
dante
worshipped
beatrice
i
believe
that
was
what
killed
her
if
dante
had
come
to
the
scratch
as
he
should
have
done
she
would
have
been
all
right
beatrice
was
a
married
woman
the
tenor
observed
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
just
then
the
cathedral
clock
struck
three
and
he
hastily
finished
his
wine
i
disperse
he
said
when
the
chime
was
over
take
care
of
my
fiddle
you
find
the
case
under
the
sofa
i
left
it
the
last
time
i
was
here
you
should
make
the
old
woman
stay
at
home
to
look
after
the
place
when
you
out
unscrupulous
people
might
walk
in
uninvited
you
know
ta
ta
and
the
tenor
found
himself
alone
it
was
no
use
to
go
to
bed
he
could
not
rest
his
heart
burned
within
him
it
was
no
use
to
tell
himself
that
the
boy
was
only
a
boy
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
and
he
spoke
confidently
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
and
he
had
said
what
was
it
he
had
said
not
much
in
words
perhaps
but
he
had
conveyed
an
impression
he
had
made
the
tenor
believe
that
she
thought
of
him
he
believed
it
and
he
disbelieved
it
if
she
thought
of
him
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
and
buried
his
face
in
the
cushions
the
bare
supposition
made
every
little
nerve
in
his
body
tingle
with
joy
he
ought
not
to
indulge
in
hope
perhaps
but
as
the
boy
himself
might
have
observed
you
ca
expect
much
sense
from
a
man
in
that
state
of
mind
a
few
days
later
the
tenor
saw
his
lady
again
in
the
canon
pew
and
he
was
sure
quite
sure
she
tried
to
suppress
a
smile
that
little
wretch
has
told
her
and
she
is
laughing
at
my
presumption
was
his
distressed
conclusion
i
wring
his
neck
for
him
when
he
comes
again
but
when
the
service
was
over
and
he
had
taken
his
surplice
off
she
passed
him
in
the
nave
so
close
that
he
might
have
touched
her
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
just
like
the
boy
when
he
was
shy
gave
him
a
quick
look
and
blushed
vividly
gave
him
time
to
speak
too
had
he
chosen
but
the
tenor
was
not
the
man
to
take
advantage
of
a
girlish
indiscretion
when
he
went
home
however
he
was
glad
and
he
opened
his
piano
and
sang
like
i
am
gaining
more
power
in
everything
he
said
to
himself
i
could
make
a
position
for
her
yet
chapter
viii
a
few
nights
later
the
tenor
went
out
for
a
stroll
leaving
the
windows
of
his
sitting
room
closed
but
not
fastened
and
the
lamp
turned
down
on
his
return
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
window
wide
open
and
the
room
lit
up
the
little
garden
gate
was
shut
and
bolted
he
could
easily
have
reached
over
and
opened
it
from
the
outside
but
knowing
that
it
creaked
and
not
wanting
to
disturb
his
nocturnal
visitor
until
he
had
ascertained
his
occupation
he
jumped
over
it
lightly
walked
across
the
grass
plot
to
the
window
and
looked
in
it
was
the
boy
of
course
the
tenor
recognized
him
at
once
although
all
he
could
see
of
him
at
first
were
his
legs
as
he
knelt
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
him
and
his
head
and
shoulders
under
a
sofa
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
he
up
to
now
the
tenor
wondered
just
then
the
boy
got
up
frowning
and
flushed
with
stooping
he
stamped
his
foot
impatiently
and
looked
all
round
the
room
in
search
of
something
suddenly
his
face
cleared
he
had
discovered
his
violin
oh
the
top
of
a
bookshelf
above
him
and
that
was
apparently
what
he
wanted
for
he
made
a
dash
at
it
and
took
it
down
and
hugged
it
affectionately
the
tenor
smiled
and
stepped
down
into
the
room
he
did
not
wish
to
take
his
visitor
unawares
but
the
carpet
was
soft
and
thick
and
his
quick
step
as
he
crossed
to
where
the
boy
was
standing
with
his
back
to
him
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
beloved
instrument
made
no
noise
so
that
when
the
tenor
laid
his
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
he
did
startle
him
considerably
the
boy
did
not
drop
his
instrument
but
he
uttered
an
almost
womanish
shriek
and
faced
round
with
such
a
scared
white
look
that
the
tenor
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
he
recovered
immediately
however
and
then
exclaimed
angrily
how
dare
you
startle
me
so
everybody
knows
i
ca
bear
to
be
startled
if
you
are
nothing
but
a
blunderer
you
will
spoil
everything
and
i
bolted
the
gate
too
it
would
have
made
a
noise
if
you
had
opened
it
as
you
ought
to
have
done
and
then
i
should
have
known
i
a
good
mind
to
go
away
now
and
never
come
back
again
i
am
very
sorry
said
the
tenor
but
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
you
it
might
have
been
a
thief
thieves
do
come
to
steal
grand
pianos
and
armchairs
in
lighted
chambers
with
the
windows
open
and
the
blinds
up
the
boy
retorted
do
you
feel
mean
spying
around
like
that
are
you
an
american
the
tenor
interrupted
blandly
yes
i
am
with
asperity
and
you
must
have
known
quite
well
it
was
me
who
else
could
get
into
the
close
after
the
gates
were
shut
i
never
thought
of
that
said
the
tenor
and
how
you
get
in
pray
by
the
postern
no
was
the
answer
i
come
by
the
and
his
face
cleared
as
he
saw
the
tenor
puzzled
glance
at
his
garments
i
not
wet
he
said
i
do
swim
but
the
ferry
does
not
cross
after
six
no
but
i
do
you
see
and
now
let
us
make
music
he
added
his
good
humour
restored
by
the
tenor
mystification
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
accompany
me
with
your
piano
i
will
give
you
a
treat
i
brought
my
music
the
last
time
i
was
here
and
there
it
was
piled
up
on
a
chair
beside
the
instrument
the
tenor
could
have
sworn
that
neither
chair
nor
music
was
there
when
he
went
out
that
evening
but
what
was
the
use
of
swearing
he
felt
sure
that
the
boy
in
his
present
mood
would
have
outsworn
him
without
scruple
had
it
pleased
him
to
maintain
his
assertion
so
he
opened
his
piano
in
silence
and
the
music
began
and
it
was
a
rare
treat
indeed
which
the
tenor
enjoyed
that
night
the
boy
played
with
great
technical
mastery
of
the
instrument
but
even
that
was
not
so
remarkable
as
the
originality
of
his
interpretations
he
possessed
that
sympathetic
comprehension
of
the
masters
ideas
which
is
the
first
virtue
of
a
musician
but
even
when
he
was
most
true
to
it
he
managed
to
throw
some
of
his
strong
individuality
into
the
rendering
and
hence
the
originality
which
was
the
special
charm
of
his
playing
as
an
artist
he
certainly
satisfied
even
the
sensitive
soul
of
the
tenor
was
refreshed
when
he
played
but
in
other
respects
he
was
obviously
deficient
so
long
as
things
were
pleasant
it
was
a
question
whether
he
would
ever
stop
to
ask
himself
if
they
were
right
acts
which
lead
to
no
bodily
evil
such
as
sickness
or
that
lowering
of
the
system
which
lessens
the
power
of
enjoyment
he
was
not
likely
in
his
present
phase
to
see
much
objection
to
and
for
the
truth
for
verbal
accuracy
in
his
assertions
that
is
he
had
no
particular
respect
all
this
however
the
tenor
was
more
reluctant
to
acknowledge
perhaps
than
slow
to
perceive
he
was
one
of
those
who
expect
a
great
soul
to
accompany
great
gifts
and
what
he
did
know
of
the
boy
shortcomings
he
condoned
he
believed
the
young
power
was
in
itself
an
indication
of
high
aspirations
and
those
he
thought
were
only
temporarily
suppressed
by
a
boyish
affectation
of
cynicism
but
the
boy
did
not
give
the
tenor
much
time
to
think
his
mind
was
like
his
eyes
when
he
was
animated
and
he
carried
the
tenor
along
with
him
from
one
occupation
to
another
with
distracting
glee
when
he
was
tired
of
making
music
as
he
called
it
he
demanded
food
and
so
long
as
he
could
cook
it
and
serve
it
himself
he
delighted
in
bacon
and
eggs
as
much
as
he
did
in
bach
and
beethoven
the
tenor
tried
to
wean
him
of
his
nocturnal
habits
but
to
this
the
boy
would
not
listen
he
said
he
liked
to
sit
up
all
night
and
when
he
said
he
liked
a
thing
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
adduced
an
unanswerable
argument
in
its
favour
the
tenor
complained
of
fatigue
the
long
nights
affected
his
voice
he
said
and
made
him
unfit
for
work
but
the
boy
only
grinned
at
this
and
told
him
he
get
used
to
it
then
he
threatened
to
shut
up
the
house
and
go
to
bed
if
the
boy
did
not
come
in
proper
time
and
on
one
occasion
he
carried
out
his
threat
but
when
the
boy
arrived
he
made
night
hideous
with
horrid
howls
until
the
tenor
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
let
him
in
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
neighbourhood
after
which
the
tenor
ceased
to
remonstrate
and
it
became
one
of
the
pleasures
of
his
life
to
prepare
for
this
terrible
hungry
boy
he
worked
in
his
garden
early
and
late
cultivating
the
succulent
roots
which
the
latter
loved
the
fruits
and
the
vegetables
and
last
but
not
least
the
flowers
for
he
never
could
feed
without
flowers
be
said
and
the
tenor
ministered
to
this
exaction
with
the
rest
he
is
dainty
because
he
is
delicate
the
tenor
thought
always
excusing
him
when
he
is
older
and
stronger
he
will
grow
out
of
all
these
epicurean
niceties
of
taste
i
must
make
him
dig
too
and
fence
and
row
he
soon
develop
more
manliness
that
he
was
spoiling
the
boy
in
the
meantime
never
occurred
to
him
not
even
when
he
noticed
that
the
latter
took
all
these
kindnesses
as
a
matter
of
course
and
only
grumbled
when
some
accustomed
attention
was
omitted
the
tenor
was
vexed
sometimes
and
obliged
to
find
fault
but
the
boy
could
always
soothe
him
i
am
sure
you
love
me
he
would
say
your
life
was
not
worth
living
until
i
came
and
you
could
not
live
without
me
now
i
am
a
horrid
little
brute
i
know
but
i
have
my
finer
feelings
too
my
capacity
for
loving
and
that
raises
me
all
love
is
sweet
given
or
returned
when
the
boy
quoted
or
recited
anything
he
really
felt
he
had
a
way
of
lingering
over
the
words
as
if
each
syllable
were
a
pleasure
to
him
the
deep
contralto
of
his
voice
was
at
its
sweetest
then
and
he
seldom
failed
to
make
his
own
mood
felt
as
he
intended
the
tenor
justly
incensed
by
some
wicked
piece
of
mischief
was
often
obliged
to
turn
away
that
he
might
maintain
his
authority
and
not
be
seen
to
soften
but
he
never
deceived
the
boy
who
could
gauge
the
effect
of
his
persuasion
to
a
nicety
and
would
grin
like
a
fiend
behind
the
back
at
the
success
of
his
own
eloquence
no
matter
what
he
had
done
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
always
managed
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
before
they
parted
he
knew
the
tenor
weak
point
angelica
and
when
everything
else
failed
he
would
play
upon
that
unmercifully
but
he
had
a
way
of
speaking
of
his
sister
which
often
made
the
tenor
seriously
angry
he
did
not
believe
the
boy
meant
half
the
disrespect
with
which
he
mentioned
her
but
it
galled
him
nevertheless
and
on
one
occasion
when
the
boy
had
repeated
some
scandalous
gossip
to
which
the
tenor
objected
and
afterward
excused
himself
by
saying
that
it
was
not
his
but
his
sister
story
the
tenor
indignation
overflowed
and
he
lectured
him
severely
you
should
never
forget
that
your
sister
is
an
innocent
girl
he
said
and
it
is
degrading
to
her
even
to
have
her
name
associated
with
such
ideas
but
the
boy
only
grinned
bless
you
he
retorted
do
make
so
much
ado
about
nothing
she
quite
as
wise
as
we
are
the
tenor
eyes
flashed
i
call
that
disloyal
he
said
even
if
it
were
true
and
it
is
not
true
it
would
be
disloyal
and
i
am
ashamed
of
you
if
you
ever
dare
to
speak
of
your
sister
in
that
light
way
to
me
again
i
thrash
you
for
a
moment
the
boy
was
astonished
by
the
threat
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
stared
at
the
tenor
but
quickly
recovering
himself
he
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
oh
my
he
exclaimed
what
a
you
would
be
how
do
you
know
she
is
such
a
saint
you
are
a
little
brute
was
all
the
answer
the
tenor
vouchsafed
but
the
question
made
him
think
he
could
picture
her
to
himself
at
any
time
as
he
saw
her
in
the
canon
pew
and
the
pale
proud
purity
of
her
face
with
the
unvarying
calm
of
her
demeanour
were
assurances
enough
for
him
his
dear
lady
his
girl
he
would
stop
it
he
would
make
this
scapegrace
brother
of
hers
respect
her
even
as
he
had
threatened
if
necessary
do
you
know
what
she
calls
you
that
youth
asked
presently
breaking
in
upon
the
tenor
meditation
in
a
confident
way
as
if
he
could
not
be
mistaken
about
the
subject
of
it
but
the
tenor
was
not
to
be
beguiled
all
at
once
i
have
already
requested
you
not
to
mention
your
sister
to
me
he
said
i
know
was
the
cool
rejoinder
but
i
promised
on
my
word
of
honour
to
tell
you
what
she
calls
you
she
calls
you
israfil
he
repeated
the
angel
of
song
you
know
but
the
tenor
made
no
sign
the
boy
watched
him
a
moment
and
then
continued
unabashed
i
shall
call
you
israfil
myself
i
think
for
the
future
but
i
like
your
own
name
too
he
added
i
have
only
just
found
it
out
everybody
here
calls
you
the
tenor
you
know
and
how
did
you
find
it
out
pray
if
i
may
ask
i
looked
everywhere
said
the
boy
glancing
round
him
comprehensively
and
at
last
i
found
it
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
that
was
in
that
bible
you
keep
in
your
bedroom
here
it
is
and
he
took
it
out
of
his
david
julian
vanetemple
haysthorpe
castle
hays
a
painful
spasm
contracted
the
tenor
face
oh
boy
he
said
in
a
deep
stern
voice
that
made
the
latter
quail
for
once
have
you
no
sense
of
honour
at
all
you
must
give
that
back
to
me
immediately
the
boy
returned
it
without
a
word
and
the
tenor
went
upstairs
his
step
was
listless
and
when
he
came
back
he
looked
pale
and
disheartened
he
sat
down
in
his
accustomed
seat
beside
the
fireplace
farthest
from
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
the
cathedral
but
facing
it
himself
and
rested
his
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
his
head
on
his
hand
taking
no
notice
of
the
boy
however
who
waited
a
while
casting
anxious
glances
at
him
and
then
rose
softly
and
stole
away
when
the
tenor
roused
himself
he
found
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
table
beside
him
on
which
was
written
dear
israfil
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
it
without
thinking
i
will
never
hurt
you
like
that
again
only
forgive
me
and
the
tenor
forgave
him
on
another
occasion
when
there
was
peace
between
them
and
they
were
both
in
a
merry
mood
the
boy
said
he
had
a
grievance
and
when
the
tenor
asked
what
it
was
he
complained
that
the
tenor
had
never
taken
interest
enough
in
him
to
ask
him
his
name
no
now
you
mention
it
the
tenor
answered
i
never
thought
of
your
having
a
name
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
me
such
a
nonentity
just
the
opposite
your
individuality
is
so
strongly
marked
that
you
do
seem
to
require
to
be
labelled
like
other
people
what
is
your
name
claude
the
tenor
laughed
ironically
oh
no
he
said
it
is
maude
you
mean
delicate
dainty
maude
but
the
boy
only
roared
this
kind
of
insinuation
never
roused
his
resentment
on
the
contrary
it
delighted
him
imagine
the
feelings
of
the
flowers
he
said
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
convulsed
him
if
my
remarkable
head
sunning
over
with
curls
were
to
shine
out
on
them
suddenly
and
want
to
be
their
sun
i
am
afraid
you
are
incorrigible
the
tenor
answered
you
seem
to
glory
in
being
effeminate
if
wholesome
ridicule
has
no
effect
you
die
an
old
woman
in
the
opprobrious
sense
of
the
word
i
make
you
respect
these
delicate
fingers
of
mine
though
the
boy
irritably
interposed
and
then
he
took
up
his
violin
i
make
you
quiver
he
drew
a
long
melodious
wail
from
the
instrument
then
lightly
ran
up
the
chromatic
scale
and
paused
on
an
upper
note
for
an
instant
before
he
began
with
perfect
certainty
of
idea
and
marvellous
modulations
and
transitions
in
the
expression
of
it
to
make
music
that
steeped
the
tenor
whole
being
in
bliss
the
latter
had
noticed
before
that
it
was
to
his
senses
absolutely
not
at
all
to
his
intellect
that
the
boy
playing
always
appealed
but
he
did
not
quarrel
with
it
on
that
account
for
music
was
the
only
form
of
sensuous
indulgence
he
ever
rioted
in
and
besides
once
under
the
spell
of
the
boy
playing
he
could
not
have
resisted
it
even
if
he
would
so
completely
was
he
carried
away
the
boy
white
fingers
were
certainly
not
out
of
place
at
such
work
do
i
play
like
an
old
woman
in
the
opprobrious
sense
of
the
word
he
demanded
mimicking
the
tenor
oh
boy
the
latter
exclaimed
with
a
deep
drawn
sigh
of
satisfaction
yon
have
genius
when
you
play
you
are
like
that
creature
in
the
of
atlas
a
sexless
thing
it
was
and
in
its
growth
it
seemed
to
have
developed
no
defect
of
either
sex
yet
all
the
grace
of
both
but
the
boy
frowned
for
a
moment
at
the
definition
and
then
he
said
is
that
what
you
call
genius
now
i
make
it
something
like
that
only
different
i
believe
it
is
the
attributes
of
both
minds
masculine
and
feminine
perfectly
united
in
one
person
of
either
sex
the
tenor
lolling
in
his
smiled
at
him
lazily
there
was
no
end
to
his
indulgence
of
the
boy
but
still
he
led
him
by
example
principally
but
also
by
suggestion
as
on
one
occasion
when
the
boy
had
been
sketching
out
a
scheme
of
life
in
which
self
was
all
predominant
and
the
tenor
asked
do
you
never
feel
any
impulse
to
do
something
for
your
suffering
to
which
the
boy
at
first
rejoined
derisively
am
i
not
one
of
the
best
of
their
benefactors
would
you
say
that
a
fellow
who
plays
as
i
can
does
nothing
for
his
to
make
music
is
my
vocation
and
i
follow
it
like
a
man
but
after
a
moment
thought
he
confessed
once
indeed
i
did
try
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
but
i
failed
disastrously
what
did
you
try
i
took
a
class
in
a
sunday
school
he
waited
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
this
announcement
on
the
tenor
i
did
indeed
he
protested
but
eh
i
can
not
say
that
success
attended
the
effort
in
fact
both
i
and
my
class
were
forcibly
ejected
from
the
building
before
the
school
closed
you
see
i
had
no
vocation
and
it
was
foolish
to
experiment
the
tenor
said
no
more
on
the
subject
and
did
not
mean
to
but
the
boy
returned
to
it
himself
eventually
and
it
was
evident
that
the
wish
to
do
something
for
somebody
was
taking
possession
of
him
seriously
this
was
the
tenor
tactful
way
with
him
and
from
such
slight
indications
of
awakening
thought
he
continued
to
augur
well
for
the
boy
chapter
ix
so
time
passed
on
changing
all
things
greatly
or
with
infinitesimal
changes
according
to
their
nature
the
colours
worn
in
crowded
thoroughfares
varied
with
the
varying
fashions
the
tint
of
the
summer
foliage
with
sun
and
rain
and
dust
doors
closed
the
whole
long
winter
were
opened
now
and
left
so
and
the
young
people
passed
to
and
fro
thronging
to
river
banks
but
lately
deserted
to
the
cricket
fields
garden
or
wood
or
lawn
the
very
faces
of
the
streets
were
changing
enlivened
by
plaster
and
paint
and
polish
the
face
of
the
land
with
the
certain
advance
of
the
season
the
faces
of
friends
with
something
not
to
be
named
but
visible
strange
and
for
the
most
part
disheartening
it
was
the
old
story
for
ever
and
ever
all
things
changed
always
but
the
chime
was
immutable
as
the
days
grew
gradually
to
weeks
his
one
connecting
link
with
the
outer
world
became
dearer
and
dearer
to
the
lonely
tenor
the
nights
that
brought
the
boy
were
happy
nights
looked
forward
to
with
eagerness
and
prepared
for
with
difficulty
for
at
this
time
the
tenor
denied
himself
some
of
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
that
he
might
buy
him
the
burgundy
he
loved
to
sip
he
did
no
more
than
sip
and
therefore
the
tenor
indulged
him
drink
was
not
to
be
one
of
his
vices
evidently
the
tenor
although
he
would
not
have
acknowledged
it
held
that
the
boy
was
a
creature
apart
and
one
therefore
whom
it
was
not
fair
to
measure
by
the
common
standard
doubtless
the
manner
of
their
meeting
had
something
to
do
with
this
idea
the
boy
was
associated
in
the
tenor
mind
with
many
sweet
associations
with
the
beautiful
still
night
with
the
tenor
far
off
ideal
of
all
that
is
gracious
and
womanly
with
the
music
that
was
in
him
and
further
with
a
sympathetic
comprehension
of
those
moments
when
gray
glimpses
of
the
old
cathedral
or
a
warm
breath
of
perfumed
air
from
the
garden
or
some
slight
sound
such
as
the
note
of
a
night
bird
breaking
the
silence
fired
a
train
of
deep
emotion
and
set
his
whole
poetic
nature
quivering
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
it
joy
sanctified
by
reverence
and
enlarged
beyond
comparison
by
love
with
such
moods
as
these
the
boy
own
mood
was
always
in
harmony
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
tenor
thought
it
was
then
that
he
was
himself
and
that
those
wild
ebullitions
of
spirits
were
only
affected
to
disguise
some
deeper
feeling
of
which
he
was
ashamed
as
their
intimacy
ripened
there
were
times
when
not
only
his
whole
demeanour
but
his
very
nature
seemed
to
change
when
he
craved
for
dimness
and
quiet
and
when
he
would
work
upon
the
tenor
with
little
caressing
ways
that
won
his
heart
and
drew
from
him
although
he
was
habitually
undemonstrative
expressions
of
tenderness
which
were
almost
paternal
in
his
quieter
moods
the
boy
would
sit
in
the
dim
lamplight
on
a
footstool
beside
the
tenor
chair
leaning
his
head
against
the
arm
of
it
while
the
latter
smoked
and
the
tap
tap
tap
of
the
clematis
and
honeysuckle
on
the
window
pane
kept
time
to
the
thoughts
of
each
long
intervals
of
silence
were
natural
to
the
tenor
and
it
was
generally
the
boy
who
broke
the
charm
he
would
talk
seriously
then
and
often
about
his
sister
and
was
not
to
be
silenced
until
he
had
had
his
say
he
conquered
the
tenor
as
usual
by
his
persistence
but
the
latter
was
not
much
influenced
by
what
he
said
at
first
gradually
however
and
by
dint
of
constant
iteration
some
of
the
boy
assertions
became
impressed
upon
his
mind
he
began
to
believe
that
angelica
did
wish
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
to
admit
to
himself
that
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
winning
her
regard
eventually
but
his
high
mindedness
shrank
from
approaching
a
girl
whose
social
position
was
so
far
above
his
own
in
the
matter
of
money
that
is
for
of
course
the
tenor
had
a
proper
respect
for
art
he
knew
that
to
be
a
great
artist
with
the
will
and
power
to
make
his
art
elevating
is
to
be
great
in
the
greatest
way
and
he
also
knew
that
his
own
gift
was
second
to
none
but
would
she
link
her
lot
with
his
he
yearned
for
some
assurance
he
had
no
ambition
whatever
for
himself
but
he
would
have
toiled
to
succeed
for
her
it
was
his
weakness
to
require
someone
to
work
for
as
he
was
working
for
the
boy
a
purely
personal
ambition
seemed
to
him
a
vexing
vain
and
insufficient
motive
for
action
all
selfless
people
suffer
from
indolence
when
only
their
own
interests
are
in
question
they
require
a
strong
incentive
from
without
to
arouse
them
such
incentive
as
the
tenor
had
was
in
itself
a
pleasure
to
him
a
refinement
of
pleasure
which
might
be
coarsened
which
certainly
would
be
impaired
by
any
change
he
had
however
begun
to
make
plans
he
was
determined
to
go
and
take
his
place
amongst
the
singers
of
the
world
but
when
exactly
he
had
not
decided
as
the
boy
declared
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
found
it
difficult
to
tear
himself
away
from
morningquest
of
course
he
would
go
in
fact
he
felt
he
must
go
soon
say
when
these
drawings
for
his
good
friend
the
dean
were
finished
by
the
way
boy
he
asked
one
night
what
is
your
family
name
and
who
are
your
people
my
family
name
is
wells
the
boy
answered
demurely
my
father
has
a
little
place
in
the
neighbourhood
and
my
grandfather
lives
here
too
wells
the
tenor
repeated
i
seem
to
know
the
name
oh
doubtless
the
boy
observed
this
is
a
hotbed
of
wellses
israfil
he
pleaded
he
was
nestling
beside
the
tenor
in
the
dim
half
light
watching
the
latter
smoke
israfil
tell
me
all
about
yourself
tell
me
about
that
old
castle
in
the
north
to
which
your
letter
was
addressed
tell
me
who
you
are
i
want
your
sympathy
you
have
it
all
dear
boy
the
tenor
said
i
shall
not
feel
that
i
have
until
you
ask
for
mine
you
would
not
deny
me
this
if
you
knew
what
a
stranger
i
am
to
the
luxury
of
loving
i
want
to
cultivate
the
power
to
care
for
others
just
now
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
sympathise
with
anyone
for
more
than
a
moment
and
that
is
the
cause
of
all
you
object
to
in
me
but
if
you
would
confide
in
me
if
you
would
make
me
feel
that
i
am
nearer
to
you
than
anybody
else
is
i
believe
i
could
be
different
the
tenor
reflected
for
a
little
if
i
were
to
make
you
my
confidant
boy
would
you
respect
my
confidence
he
said
at
last
assuredly
the
boy
replied
i
promise
on
my
honour
you
shall
tell
her
yourself
the
tenor
ignored
this
last
impertinence
but
the
boy
was
not
abashed
israfil
he
pursued
they
say
you
are
the
son
of
an
actress
and
some
great
nobleman
and
that
when
you
found
it
out
your
intolerable
pride
made
you
give
up
your
profession
and
come
and
bury
yourself
alive
in
morningquest
because
you
could
not
bear
the
stigma
are
you
the
son
of
such
parents
israfil
the
tenor
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
has
your
sister
heard
these
reports
he
asked
yes
and
what
does
she
say
oh
does
mind
she
rather
leans
to
the
nobleman
theory
and
when
people
of
that
kind
i
mean
the
nobility
and
gentry
he
exclaimed
with
a
grin
the
worst
of
being
in
society
is
that
you
are
forced
to
know
so
many
disreputable
people
when
they
come
to
our
house
and
they
do
come
in
shoals
angelica
being
the
attraction
you
know
then
we
speculate
angelica
feels
quite
sure
that
the
duke
of
morningquest
himself
is
your
father
he
was
a
loose
old
fish
they
say
and
there
is
a
sort
of
family
likeness
between
you
angelica
thinks
you
came
here
that
your
presence
might
be
a
continual
reproach
to
him
not
a
very
worthy
thought
said
the
tenor
drily
well
said
the
boy
with
much
candour
i
could
not
swear
it
was
angelica
it
has
a
strong
family
likeness
to
some
of
my
own
it
has
said
the
tenor
he
was
lolling
in
his
deep
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
vest
and
his
legs
crossed
and
now
he
laid
his
sunny
head
back
wearily
against
the
cushion
and
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
it
was
his
accustomed
attitude
in
moments
of
abstraction
and
the
boy
let
him
alone
for
a
little
watching
him
quietly
then
he
grew
impatient
and
broke
the
silence
it
true
israfil
he
asked
is
what
true
lowering
his
eyes
to
look
at
him
without
changing
his
position
is
it
true
that
you
are
the
son
of
an
actress
and
a
duke
probably
the
tenor
answered
anything
is
probable
where
the
most
absolute
uncertainty
prevails
then
you
do
know
who
you
are
the
boy
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
deep
disgust
due
to
baffled
curiosity
i
have
the
most
remote
idea
said
the
tenor
i
do
believe
you
boy
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
will
not
have
my
word
doubted
i
know
said
the
boy
you
are
always
autocratic
but
i
ca
believe
you
do
know
who
you
are
it
is
incredible
you
would
never
give
yourself
such
airs
if
you
had
something
to
go
upon
and
besides
you
command
respect
naturally
as
people
do
and
you
have
all
the
manner
and
bearing
of
a
man
accustomed
to
good
society
you
have
the
accent
too
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
difficulty
in
your
case
is
to
believe
in
the
actress
she
was
a
very
superior
kind
of
actress
i
suspect
and
at
any
rate
you
must
have
been
brought
up
and
educated
by
somebody
do
tell
me
israfil
i
am
burning
to
know
your
curiosity
is
quite
womanish
boy
that
is
quite
the
right
word
the
boy
answered
glibly
women
are
generous
and
elevated
and
generous
and
elevated
mind
is
distinguished
by
nothing
more
certainly
than
an
eminent
curiosity
the
tenor
changed
his
position
slightly
and
in
doing
so
absently
laid
his
hand
on
the
boy
head
what
queer
dry
hair
you
have
he
said
the
boy
drew
back
resentfully
i
wish
you
would
touch
my
hair
he
said
i
know
it
nasty
dry
hair
it
a
sore
point
with
me
i
think
you
should
respect
it
i
beg
your
pardon
the
tenor
answered
i
really
did
know
you
were
so
sensitive
on
the
subject
but
why
on
earth
do
you
come
so
close
you
put
that
remarkable
head
of
yours
under
my
hand
and
then
growl
at
me
for
touching
it
and
really
it
is
a
temptation
if
i
were
a
man
of
science
instead
of
a
simple
artist
i
should
like
to
examine
it
inside
and
out
the
boy
put
both
hands
up
to
his
head
and
laughed
delighted
as
usual
by
any
jest
at
his
own
expense
he
had
moved
his
footstool
back
a
little
now
and
sat
stroking
his
upper
lip
thoughtfully
and
looking
at
the
tenor
there
was
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
desire
to
know
the
tenor
secret
history
why
do
you
wear
a
moustache
he
said
suddenly
the
tenor
looked
at
him
lazily
well
i
never
did
wear
one
he
said
but
i
could
not
in
any
case
have
worn
one
with
a
surplice
the
boy
nodded
his
head
sagely
i
forgot
he
said
of
course
that
would
have
been
bad
form
a
parson
is
always
vulgarized
in
appearance
by
wearing
a
military
moustache
the
effect
is
as
incongruous
as
a
tail
would
be
if
added
to
a
figure
with
wings
but
tell
me
do
you
think
my
moustache
will
be
the
colour
of
my
eyebrows
when
it
comes
oh
boy
the
tenor
exclaimed
this
is
quite
refreshing
especially
from
you
you
will
be
quite
young
in
time
if
you
go
on
the
boy
grinned
in
his
peculiar
way
and
then
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
the
tenor
thought
from
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
was
meditating
mischief
but
before
he
had
time
to
put
it
into
effect
the
big
bell
boomed
above
them
striking
the
hour
and
then
came
the
chime
the
boy
hated
the
chime
he
said
it
was
flat
he
said
it
was
importunate
like
an
person
he
said
it
mingled
inopportunely
with
everything
he
declared
it
had
a
spite
against
him
and
would
do
him
an
injury
if
it
could
when
he
was
good
he
said
it
made
him
bad
and
when
he
was
bad
it
made
him
worse
the
tenor
had
expected
to
hear
him
swear
at
it
but
oddly
enough
considering
some
of
his
aberrations
the
boy
never
swore
his
ideas
were
occasionally
shocking
but
with
the
exception
of
certain
in
the
expression
of
them
he
was
a
purist
he
went
off
now
however
anathematizing
the
chime
and
the
tenor
was
almost
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
the
boy
superabundant
vitality
alone
was
fatiguing
and
when
he
added
as
he
often
did
a
certain
something
of
manner
to
it
which
was
perplexing
and
irritating
in
the
extreme
he
left
the
tenor
not
only
fatigued
but
jarred
all
over
yet
he
spent
the
interval
which
usually
elapsed
before
the
boy
returned
in
making
excuses
for
him
and
also
in
making
preparations
chapter
x
the
tenor
was
obliged
to
leave
the
window
of
his
sitting
room
which
looked
out
on
the
little
grass
plot
in
front
of
his
house
and
the
cathedral
opposite
open
always
now
rain
blow
or

for
the
convenience
of
the
boy
the
latter
had
changed
his
mind
about
forcing
an
entrance
if
the
tenor
he
said
would
not
make
it
quite
evident
that
he
wanted
him
by
leaving
the
window
open
so
that
he
could
come
in
his
own
way
whenever
he
chose
he
should
not
come
at
all
the
window
was
his
way
and
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
found
it
shut
he
had
gone
home
intending
as
he
afterward
declared
never
to
return
but
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
reappeared
after
an
unusually
long
interval
when
the
tenor
to
use
the
boy
own
phrase
caught
it
for
his
want
of
hospitality
of
course
he
acknowledged
he
might
have
come
in
by
the
door
or
he
might
have
knocked
at
the
window
but
then
he
did
not
choose
to
come
in
by
the
door
or
knock
at
the
window
so
that
was
all
about
it
if
the
tenor
wanted
to
see
him
he
knew
how
to
make
him
feel
he
was
welcome
and
so
on
until
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
the
tenor
was
again
obliged
to
yield
oh
the
moods
of
that
terrible
boy
no
two
the
same
and
none
to
be
relied
on
sometimes
he
was
like
a
wild
creature
there
was
no
holding
him
no
knowing
what
he
would
do
next
and
the
tenor
used
to
tremble
lest
he
should
carry
out
one
of
his
impossible
threats
among
which
serenading
the
dean
upsetting
the
chime
climbing
the
cathedral
spire
on
the
outside
or
throwing
stones
at
the
saints
in
the
great
west
window
were
intentions
so
often
expressed
that
there
seemed
some
likelihood
of
one
or
other
of
them
being
eventually
put
into
execution
then
again
he
would
saunter
in
about
midnight
and
sit
down
in
a
dejected
attitude
looking
unutterably
miserable
he
would
hardly
answer
when
the
tenor
spoke
to
him
and
if
he
did
not
speak
he
resented
it
neither
would
he
eat
nor
drink
nor
make
music
and
if
the
tenor
sang
he
sometimes
burst
into
tears
on
other
occasions
he
was
the
most
commonplace
creature
imaginable
he
would
talk
about
a
book
he
had
been
reading
a
new
picture
his
people
had
bought
the
society
in
the
neighbourhood
anything
in
fact
to
which
the
tenor
would
listen
and
the
latter
was
often
astonished
by
the
acuteness
of
his
perceptions
and
the
worldly
wisdom
of
his
conclusions
the
tenor
made
every
allowance
for
these
changes
of
mood
which
if
they
were
trying
at
times
and
certainly
they
were
trying
were
interesting
also
and
amusing
he
knew
what
an
affliction
the
sensitive
nervous
artistic
temperament
is
what
a
power
of
suffering
it
hides
beneath
the
more
superficial
power
to
be
pleased
and
he
pitied
the
boy
who
was
an
artist
in
every
sense
he
also
thought
there
had
been
mistakes
made
in
his
education
did
you
ever
go
to
a
public
school
boy
he
asked
one
night
well
no
the
boy
rejoined
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
educated
with
angelica
they
kindly
allowed
me
to
share
her
tutor
i
was
thrown
in
you
understand
just
to
fill
up
his
time
and
that
is
how
it
is
i
am
so
refined
and
cultivated
but
seriously
said
the
tenor
the
boy
raised
his
eyebrows
seriously
he
repeated
but
do
you
think
it
delicate
to
question
me
so
closely
ah
i
see
poor
fellow
you
know
any
better
but
really
your
curiosity
is
quite
womanish
i
will
tell
you
however
i
had
the
misfortune
to
sever
my
femoral
artery
when
i
was
a
brat
and
although
it
seems
to
have
come
quite
right
now
it
was
not
thought
advisable
for
me
to
rough
it
at
a
public
school
but
why
on
earth
are
they
putting
you
in
the
army
the
tenor
asked
you
mean
i
am
much
too
pretty
said
the
boy
not
to
mention
my
brains
and
manners
well
there
i
must
agree
with
you
it
does
seem
a
sad
waste
of
valuable
material
but
it
is
only
to
fill
up
an
interval
i
shall
be
put
into
a
permanent
billet
of
another
kind
eventually
whether
i
like
it
or
not
you
mean
you
will
be
put
into
the
earth
to
enrich
it
i
suppose
well
no
i
was
not
so
smart
said
the
boy
now
that
is
rather
a
good
one
for
you
oh
i
suspect
if
i
could
plumb
your
depth
i
should
find
myself
but
a
simple
shallow
child
in
comparison
no
what
i
meant
was
that
eventually
a
certain
amount
of
earth
would
come
to
me
to
enrich
me
but
what
does
your
father
think
about
this
military
manoeuvre
my
father
roared
the
boy
o
lord
you
do
know
my
father
and
he
fairly
curled
himself
up
in
convulsions
of
silent
laughter
which
the
tenor
thought
unseemly
considering
the
subject
of
it
but
he
said
no
more
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
such
a
boy
but
to
wait
and
hope
and
that
was
the
attitude
into
which
the
tenor
found
himself
most
prone
to
fall
in
these
days
with
regard
to
things
in
general
being
greatly
cheered
meanwhile
by
the
sight
of
his
lovely
lady
who
smiled
at
him
now
without
doubt
and
was
seldom
absent
from
her
accustomed
seat
in
the
canon
pew
when
he
sang
the
tenor
looked
better
now
and
more
out
of
place
than
ever
in
the
choir
better
that
is
to
say
in
the
sense
of
being
more
attractive
but
he
was
not
looking
strong
and
the
common
faces
about
him
seemed
commoner
still
when
contrasted
with
the
exceptional
refinement
of
his
own
the
constant
he
had
been
obliged
to
exercise
in
order
to
indulge
the
fancies
of
that
rapacious
boy
although
a
pleasure
in
itself
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
him
his
features
had
sharpened
a
little
his
skin
was
transparent
to
a
fault
and
the
brightness
of
his
yellow
hair
if
it
added
to
the
quite
peculiar
beauty
added
something
also
to
the
too
great
delicacy
of
his
face
it
was
the
brightness
of
his
hair
that
suggested
such
names
for
him
as
balder
the
beautiful
and
son
of
the
morning
to
the
boy
who
invariably
called
him
by
some
such
fanciful
appellation
it
was
at
this
time
too
that
a
great
painter
came
to
morningquest
and
painted
a
picture
called
the
interest
of
which
centred
in
the
tenor
himself
singing
while
angelica
gazed
at
him
as
if
she
were
the
boy
used
to
describe
this
picture
to
the
tenor
while
it
was
in
progress
but
the
latter
listening
in
his
dreamy
way
was
under
the
impression
for
some
time
that
the
work
was
one
of
his
young
friend
own
imagination
only
by
degrees
however
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
picture
was
an
actual
fact
and
then
he
was
displeased
he
thought
that
the
artist
had
taken
a
liberty
with
regard
to
himself
and
been
guilty
of
an
impertinence
so
far
as
his
lovely
lady
was
concerned
well
so
i
told
him
said
the
boy
but
you
know
dear
israfil
that
in
the
interests
of
art
as
well
as
in
the
interests
of
science
men
are
carried
away
to
such
an
extent
that
they
sometimes
forget
to
be
scrupulous
it
is
curious
he
broke
off
gazing
at
the
tenor
critically
that
angelica
should
specially
admire
your
chin
it
is
your
mouth
that
appeals
to
me
you
have
a
regular
kind
of
mouth
with
full
firm
lips
i
should
think
the
sort
of
fellow
that
women
would
like
to
kiss
do
try
to
look
as
if
you
would
kiss
a
woman
just
once
in
a
way
dear
old
chap
women
hate
men
like
priests
who
must
kiss
them
if
they
would
and
they
have
no
respect
for
other
men
who
would
kiss
them
if
they
could
i
know
angelica
has
the
last
words
were
delivered
from
outside
in
the
garden
after
the
boy
had
made
his
escape
through
the
window
chapter
xi
how
long
the
tenor
dream
would
have
remained
unbroken
by
action
it
is
hard
to
say
his
want
of
personal
ambition
his
perfect
serenity
of
mind
and
his
thankfulness
for
a
state
of
things
so
much
more
blissful
than
anything
he
had
ever
expected
to
fall
to
his
lot
again
the
languid
summer
weather
and
his
affectionate
anxiety
for
the
boy
all
combined
to
keep
him
in
morningquest
and
to
keep
his
indefinite
plans
for
the
future
still
in
abeyance
other
people
however
were
not
so
apathetic
the
dean
friendly
remonstrances
had
been
redoubled
of
late
the
boy
had
become
importunate
and
even
the
mild
musicians
of
morningquest
whose
boast
it
was
to
have
that
bright
particular
star
in
their
own
little
firmament
ventured
to
hint
respectfully
that
he
was
not
doing
his
duty
by
himself
all
this
kindly
interest
in
his
future
career
was
not
without
its
effect
upon
him
and
if
it
did
not
actually
rouse
him
to
act
it
put
him
in
the
mood
to
be
aroused
he
was
sitting
alone
one
evening
in
his
accustomed
seat
beside
the
fireplace
or
rather
beside
the
bank
of
ferns
and
flowering
plants
which
he
had
arranged
before
the
fireplace
so
as
to
hide
it
at
the
instigation
of
the
boy
a
shaded
lamp
stood
on
a
table
behind
him
throwing
its
softened
light
from
over
his
shoulder
on
to
the
big
book
which
lay
open
on
his
knee
but
he
was
not
reading
he
had
placed
his
hands
upon
the
book
and
was
resting
his
head
on
the
back
of
the
chair
his
yellow
hair
seemed
to
shine
out
of
the
surrounding
gloom
with
a
light
of
its
own
but
his
face
was
in
shadow
the
window
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
behind
him
was
shut
and
the
creepers
outside
brushed
gently
against
it
tapping
now
and
then
and
keeping
up
a
continual
soft
rustle
and
murmur
of
leaves
like
friendly
voices
soothing
insensibly
the
other
window
was
open
as
usual
and
as
he
sat
now
he
could
see
the
old
cathedral
opposite
towering
above
him
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
the
shadows
were
strong
and
the
details
of
the
facade
flying
buttress
gargoyle
and
cornice
with
a
glimpse
of
the
apse
and
spire
were
all
distinct
but
as
the
tenor
thoughtfully
perused
them
the
whole
fabric
suddenly
disappeared
from
view
blotted
out
by
an
opaque
body
round
which
the
moonlight
showed
like
a
rim
of
silver
tracing
in
outline
the
slender
figure
of
the
boy
the
tenor
had
forgotten
him
for
once
and
was
startled
from
his
reverie
by
the
unexpected
apparition
but
he
did
not
alter
his
position
or
make
any
sign
the
boy
preferred
to
come
and
go
like
that
ungreeted
and
unquestioned
and
the
tenor
of
course
humoured
this
harmless
peculiarity
with
the
rest
the
boy
sauntered
in
now
in
a
casual
way
arranged
his
hair
at
a
mirror
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
leant
back
crossed
his
legs
folded
both
hands
on
his
hat
which
lie
held
on
his
knee
and
looked
at
the
tenor
lazily
in
the
little
pause
that
followed
the
tenor
glanced
at
his
book
again
and
then
he
closed
it
israfil
the
boy
said
suddenly
leaning
forward
to
look
at
the
book
as
if
to
make
sure
and
speaking
in
an
awestruck
voice
is
that
the
you
were
reading
any
evidence
of
the
tenor
simple
piety
which
was
neither
concealed
nor
displayed
because
it
was
in
no
way
affected
but
quite
natural
to
him
and
he
was
therefore
unconscious
of
it
had
a
peculiar
effect
upon
the
boy
it
seemed
to
shock
him
but
whether
it
made
him
feel
ashamed
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
say
sometimes
the
first
effect
over
he
would
remain
thoughtful
as
if
subdued
by
it
but
at
others
it
appeared
to
have
irritated
him
and
made
him
aggressively
cynical
he
was
all
subdued
you
believe
it
israfil
do
you
he
said
watching
is
a
fact
for
you
the
tenor
did
not
answer
except
by
folding
his
hands
upon
his
book
again
and
looking
at
the
boy
now
do
believe
a
word
of
it
the
latter
pursued
but
it
makes
me
feel
i
have
my
moments
the
bible
is
a
wonderful
book
i
open
it
sometimes
and
read
it
haphazard
i
did
last
night
and
came
upon
oh
israfil
the
grand
simplicity
of
it
all
the
wonderful
solemn
earnestness
it
brought
me
to
my
knees
and
made
me
hold
up
my
hands
but
i
could
not
pray
i
heard
the
chime
though
that
night
it
sounded
insistent
it
seemed
to
assert
itself
in
a
new
way
it
was
as
if
it
spoke
to
me
alone
and
i
felt
a
strange
sense
of
something
pending
something
for
which
i
shall
have
to
answer
watching
yes
i
feel
all
that
but
dejectedly
one
feels
so
much
more
than
one
knows
and
when
i
want
to
know
i
am
never
satisfied
trying
to
find
the
little
we
know
amongst
the
lot
that
we
feel
is
a
veritable
search
for
mignonette
seeds
in
sand
the
tenor
continued
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
time
but
do
you
never
pray
dear
boy
he
said
at
last
the
boy
shook
his
head
you
never
oh
yes
more
cheerfully
i
used
to
believe
in
all
the
bogies
at
one
time
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
brought
under
some
bad
influence
then
tell
me
who
was
it
angelica
said
the
boy
oh
boy
your
sister
ah
you
do
know
that
young
lady
the
boy
rejoined
with
his
cynical
chuckle
she
is
very
fascinating
i
allow
but
always
in
her
conversation
serpent
hisses
where
the
sweet
bird
sings
the
tenor
toyed
with
the
cover
of
his
book
and
was
silent
after
a
time
the
boy
spoke
diffidently
but
do
pray
israfil
he
asked
yes
the
tenor
answered
i
try
to
make
prayer
the
attitude
of
my
mind
always
i
mean
i
try
to
be
and
to
do
and
to
think
nothing
that
i
could
not
make
a
subject
of
prayer
at
any
time
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
direct
petition
is
the
only
or
best
way
to
pray
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
in
a
certain
attitude
of
mind
we
find
the
highest
form
of
prayer
a
reverential
attitude
toward
all
things
good
and
beautiful
by
which
we
attain
to
an
inexpressible
tenderness
that
enemy
of
evil
emotions
and
also
to
rest
and
peace
and
a
great
deep
solemn
joy
which
is
permanent
i
do
think
i
ever
knew
a
man
before
who
prayed
regularly
the
boy
observed
thoughtfully
rising
as
he
spoke
and
standing
with
his
hat
on
except
the
clergy
i
suppose
but
then
that
is
their
profession
and
so
one
thinks
nothing
of
it
but
i
wonder
if
many
men
of
the
world
pray
i
suppose
they
have
to
give
up
everything
that
makes
life
pleasant
before
they
can
conscientiously
begin
far
from
it
said
the
tenor
smiling
but
you
are
going
early
you
hungry
the
boy
grinned
as
if
the
insinuation
were
flattering
no
i
am
not
hungry
he
answered
i
dined
at
home
for
a
wonder
and
when
i
do
that
i
do
generally
want
any
more
for
some
time
by
home
i
mean
at
my
grandad
where
they
always
have
seven
or
eight
courses
and
i
resist
any
of
them
i
lose
my
self
respect
but
satisfy
my
voracity
which
has
the
effect
of
improving
the
greediness
out
of
my
mind
but
i
am
in
a
hurry
this
evening
and
i
have
already
outstayed
my
time
i
only
came
in
for
a
moment
to
ask
you
if
you
are
to
sing
the
tenor
nodded
in
that
case
i
am
to
beg
you
for
her
angels
angelica
ventures
to
make
the
request
the
words
were
scarcely
spoken
and
his
flying
footsteps
were
still
audible
as
he
ran
lightly
up
the
close
when
the
cathedral
clock
began
to
strike
there
was
only
one
emphatic
throb
of
the
iron
tongue
followed
by
a
long
reverberation
and
then
came
the
chime
the
tenor
who
had
risen
stood
listening
with
upturned
face
until
the
end
but
the
chime
failed
of
its
effect
for
once
there
was
something
weary
and
enigmatical
in
the
old
worn
strain
hitherto
it
had
always
been
a
comfort
and
an
assurance
to
him
but
for
the
first
time
it
was
fraught
with
some
portentous
meaning
was
there
any
cause
for
alarm
in
what
was
happening
any
reason
for
fear
that
should
make
it
merciful
to
prepare
him
with
migivings
it
was
no
new
thing
for
the
tenor
to
be
asked
to
sing
something
special
and
he
tried
to
think
such
a
request
although
it
came
from
angelica
if
indeed
it
came
from
her
and
was
not
a
fabrication
of
the
boy
was
a
whim
as
trifling
as
the
rest
but
even
if
it
were
trifles
as
all
the
world
knows
are
not
to
be
despised
someone
has
said
already
that
they
made
up
the
sum
of
life
and
it
may
also
be
observed
that
the
hand
of
death
is
weighted
by
them
chapter
xii
the
tenor
happened
to
be
entering
the
cathedral
next
day
for
the
afternoon
service
just
as
angelica
was
being
handed
from
a
carriage
by
a
singular
looking
man
who
wore
was
clean
shaven
and
had
an
immense
head
of
hair
angelica
very
evidently
called
the
attention
of
this
gentleman
to
the
tenor
as
he
passed
and
the
latter
heard
the
ach
of
satisfaction
to
which
the
stranger
gave
utterance
when
he
had
adjusted
his
with
undisguised
interest
and
taken
the
tenor
in
the
latter
felt
that
he
had
seen
the
man
before
and
while
he
was
putting
on
his
surplice
he
remembered
who
he
was
an
by
sight
to
regular
opera
goers
and
musicians
generally
having
established
his
identity
the
reason
of
his
presence
there
that
afternoon
was
at
once
apparent
the
tenor
had
been
requested
to
sing
a
solo
which
was
admirably
calculated
to
display
the
range
and
flexibility
of
his
voice
to
the
best
advantage
and
the
had
been
brought
to
hear
him
the
mountain
had
come
to
mahomet
the
tenor
never
sang
better
than
upon
that
occasion
and
he
had
scarcely
reached
his
cottage
after
the
service
was
over
when
the
burst
in
upon
him
having
in
his
eagerness
omitted
the
ceremony
of
knocking
he
seized
the
tenor
hand
exclaiming
in
broken
english
oh
my
tear
froind
you
are
an
ideal
then
he
flung
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
curvetted
about
the
room
alternately
rubbing
his
hands
and
running
his
fingers
upward
through
his
luxuriant
hair
till
it
stood
on
end
all
over
his
head
and
have
i
found
you
he
cried
sentimentally
apostrophising
the
ceiling
oh
have
i
found
you
what
a
ach
gott
it
is
the
prince
himself
boat
and
he
stopped
prancing
in
order
to
point
his
long
forefinger
at
the
tenor
chest
boat
you
are
an
actor
born
my
froind
you
was
the
of
himself
jus
now
you
do
that
part
as
if
you
feel
him
too
why
jerking
his
head
towards
the
cathedral
with
a
gesture
which
signified
that
if
he
had
not
seen
the
thing
himself
he
never
could
have
believed
it
why
you
loose
yourself
in
there
kompletely
then
he
asked
the
tenor
to
sing
again
which
the
tenor
did
being
careful
however
not
to
give
his
excitable
visitor
too
much
lest
the
intoxicating
draught
should
bring
on
a
fit
the
had
come
to
make
the
tenor
golden
offers
and
he
did
not
leave
him
now
until
the
tenor
had
agreed
to
accept
them
the
dean
came
in
by
chance
in
time
to
witness
the
conclusion
of
the
bargain
adding
by
his
congratulations
and
good
wishes
to
the
tenor
own
belief
that
such
an
opportunity
was
not
to
be
lost
the
drawings
the
tenor
had
been
doing
for
the
dean
were
all
but
finished
now
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
tenor
should
enter
upon
his
new
engagement
in
one
month
time
when
he
found
himself
alone
at
last
and
could
think
the
matter
over
he
was
thoroughly
content
with
what
he
had
done
there
could
be
no
doubt
now
as
to
whose
wish
it
was
that
he
should
go
and
make
a
name
for
himself
and
he
felt
sure
that
the
step
he
was
about
to
take
would
not
lead
to
the
separation
he
dreaded
but
rather
to
the
union
for
which
he
might
at
last
without
presumption
after
such
encouragement
venture
to
hope
chapter
xiii
a
few
nights
after
the
tenor
had
signed
the
agreement
the
boy
burst
in
upon
him
exclaiming
in
guttural
accents
oh
my
tear
froind
have
i
found
you
then
he
threw
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
began
to
prance
up
and
down
waving
his
hands
ecstatically
the
tenor
picked
up
a
cushion
and
threw
it
at
him
you
wretched
boy
he
said
laughing
who
told
you
he
did
that
oh
my
israfil
the
boy
replied
why
on
earth
do
you
ask
who
me
you
must
know
by
this
time
and
if
you
do
you
should
that
genius
does
not
require
to
be
told
given
the
man
and
the
circumstances
and
we
tell
you
exactly
what
he
do
do
you
know
and
the
boy
showed
his
teeth
but
the
tenor
was
not
convinced
knowing
your
patience
and
zeal
when
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
i
think
that
was
the
euphemism
you
employed
the
last
time
you
had
to
apologize
for
the
unscrupulous
indulgence
of
your
boundless
curiosity
the
tenor
standing
with
his
back
to
the
boy
observed
with
easy
deliberation
as
he
filled
and
lighted
a
pipe
i
have
little
doubt
that
you
assisted
at
the
interview
from
some
safe
coigne
of
to
borrow
another
of
your
perhaps
from
the
closet
under
the
stairs
there
or
from
behind
the
sofa
the
boy
suggested
with
that
enigmatical
grin
of
his
which
the
tenor
disliked
perhaps
because
it
was
enigmatical
like
my
new
suit
israfil
he
demanded
in
exactly
the
same
tone
he
had
on
a
spotless
flannel
boating
suit
with
a
silk
handkerchief
of
many
colours
knotted
picturesquely
round
his
neck
it
too
new
said
the
tenor
it
looks
as
if
you
got
it
for
private
theatricals
and
taken
great
care
of
it
the
boy
laughed
and
then
assuming
another
character
he
began
to
remonstrate
with
himself
playfully
in
the
tenor
voice
boy
will
you
never
be
more
manly
and
do
mock
boy
and
boy
you
have
no
soul
and
oh
boy
you
not
then
he
did
a
love
scene
between
the
tenor
and
angelica
the
tenor
tried
to
stop
this
last
performance
but
he
only
made
matters
worse
for
the
boy
argued
the
question
out
in
angelica
voice
taking
the
part
of
dear
claude
he
still
insisted
that
his
name
was
claude
and
ending
with
dear
israfil
we
are
so
happy
ourselves
i
think
claude
should
have
a
little
latitude
he
studies
so
hard
poor
boy
he
deserves
some
indulgence
when
this
amusement
ceased
to
divert
him
he
announced
his
intention
of
going
on
the
stage
of
not
going
home
till
morning
and
of
being
rowed
down
the
river
in
the
meantime
but
where
will
you
get
a
boat
at
this
time
of
night
the
tenor
objected
you
not
a
man
of
much
imagination
said
the
boy
or
you
have
asked
such
a
question
how
do
you
suppose
i
come
every
night
after
all
the
world
is
barred
and
bolted
out
of
your
sacred
close
and
the
alternative
lies
between
the
porter
at
the
postern
whom
you
know
i
shun
and
the
do
you
mean
to
say
you
row
yourself
down
the
river
every
time
you
come
i
do
said
the
boy
complacently
i
did
think
you
could
was
the
tenor
naive
ejaculation
the
boy
was
delighted
it
never
struck
you
i
suppose
he
chuckled
that
my
fragile
appearance
might
be
delusive
have
you
noticed
i
never
tire
yes
said
the
tenor
but
i
thought
that
you
probably
paid
for
these
nights
of
dissipation
by
days
of
languor
the
boy
laughed
again
do
know
the
sensation
he
declared
days
of
laziness
would
be
nearer
the
mark
i
have
plenty
of
them
it
was
a
lovely
night
all
pervaded
by
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
in
the
gardens
round
about
the
close
they
sauntered
out
turning
to
the
left
from
the
tenor
cottage
the
cathedral
being
on
their
right
the
cloisters
in
front
the
boy
walked
up
to
the
latter
and
peeped
in
come
here
dear
israfil
he
said
obligingly
and
i
will
show
you
the
beauties
of
the
place
these
are
the
cloisters
and
as
you
see
they
form
a
hollow
square
nearly
two
hundred
feet
long
and
twelve
feet
wide
yon
slowly
rising
moon
shows
the
bare
quadrangle
in
the
centre
and
the
tracery
of
the
windows
opposite
but
the
exquisite
groining
of
the
roof
and
the
quaintly
sculptured
bosses
are
still
hidden
in
deep
darkness
the
light
however
brightens
in
the
northeast
corner
and
if
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
israfil
the
tenor
had
walked
on
but
the
boy
stayed
where
he
was
and
now
began
to
improve
the
occasion
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
tenor
returned
hurriedly
for
heaven
sake
hold
your
tongue
he
expostulated
you
wake
the
whole
close
i
was
calling
your
attention
to
the
details
of
the
architecture
the
boy
rejoined
politely
and
as
usual
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
the
unfortunate
tenor
was
obliged
to
hear
him
out
when
he
stopped
the
tenor
exclaimed
thank
heaven
devoutly
then
added
no
fear
for
your
exams
boy
if
you
can
cram
like
that
but
i
did
not
know
you
were
a
cultivated
archaeologist
nor
am
i
said
the
boy
with
a
shiver
i
hate
architecture
and
i
want
to
know
about
it
but
i
ca
help
picking
it
up
it
is
horrid
to
remember
that
that
arch
yonder
was
built
in
the
time
of
william
the
conqueror
i
never
look
at
it
without
feeling
the
oppression
of
the
ages
come
upon
me
and
when
i
get
into
this
bigoted
close
and
think
of
the
heathenish
way
the
people
live
in
it
shutting
themselves
in
from
the
rest
of
the
citizens
with
unchristian
ideas
of
their
own
superiority
i
am
confirmed
in
my
unbelief
i
feel
if
there
were
any
truth
in
that
religion
those
who
profess
it
would
have
begun
to
practise
its
precepts
by
this
time
they
would
not
be
content
to
teach
it
for
ever
without
trying
it
themselves
and
oh
shaking
his
fist
at
the
cathedral
i
loathe
the
deeds
of
darkness
that
are
done
there
in
the
name
of
the
lord
what
unhappy
experience
are
you
alluding
to
boy
said
the
tenor
concerned
i
was
thinking
of
edith
poor
edith
beale
the
boy
replied
but
ask
me
to
tell
you
that
story
if
you
have
not
heard
it
it
makes
my
blood
boil
with
indignation
i
have
heard
it
the
tenor
answered
sadly
but
boy
dear
every
honest
man
deplores
such
circumstances
as
much
as
you
do
then
why
do
they
occur
the
boy
asked
hotly
if
the
honest
men
were
in
earnest
such
blackguardism
would
not
go
unpunished
but
do
let
us
talk
about
it
they
went
through
the
arm
of
the
close
in
the
centre
of
which
the
lime
trees
grew
round
a
grassy
space
enclosed
from
the
road
by
a
light
iron
railing
this
is
grateful
the
boy
exclaimed
as
they
passed
under
the
old
trees
lingering
a
while
to
listen
to
the
rustle
and
murmur
of
the
leaves
then
they
emerged
once
more
into
the
moonlight
and
took
their
way
down
the
little
lane
that
led
to
the
here
they
found
an
elegant
of
a
boat
tied
up
a
most
ladylike
craft
said
the
tenor
i
steer
said
the
boy
fixing
the
rudder
and
then
arranging
the
cushions
for
himself
while
the
tenor
meekly
took
the
oars
with
one
strong
stroke
he
brought
the
boat
into
then
headed
her
down
the
river
toward
the
sea
and
settled
to
his
oars
with
a
long
steady
pull
that
roused
the
admiration
of
the
boy
you
row
like
a
man
he
said
so
i
should
was
the
laconic
rejoinder
you
a
man
i
am
oxford
then
i
bet
and
did
you
take
your
degree
the
tenor
nodded
well
you
a
queer
chap
said
the
boy
were
you
expelled
the
tenor
shook
his
head
did
you
do
disgraceful
the
tenor
again
made
a
sign
of
negation
then
why
on
earth
did
you
come
and
bury
yourself
alive
in
morningquest
that
i
might
have
the
pleasure
of
rowing
you
down
the
river
by
moonlight
apparently
the
tenor
answered
but
without
a
smile
i
give
my
ears
to
know
the
boy
ejaculated
i
quite
believe
you
would
said
the
tenor
pausing
to
speak
after
which
he
bent
to
his
oars
with
a
will
and
the
banks
became
a
moving
panorama
to
their
vision
as
they
passed
now
they
swept
under
a
light
iron
bridge
that
crossed
the
river
with
one
bold
span
and
connected
a
busy
thoroughfare
of
the
city
with
a
pleasant
shady
suburb
beyond
then
they
wound
round
a
curve
and
on
their
left
was
a
broad
and
beautiful
old
trees
and
a
high
paling
made
of
sleepers
shutting
out
the
view
while
on
the
right
those
crowded
dwellings
of
the
poor
which
add
so
much
to
a
picture
especially
by
moonlight
and
so
little
to
the
loveliness
of
life
rose
from
the
water
edge
and
straggled
up
the
rising
ground
tumbling
over
each
other
in
every
sort
of
picturesque
irregularity
ahead
of
them
the
river
was
landlocked
by
a
wooded
hill
and
also
facing
them
was
an
old
round
tower
on
the
above
which
the
round
moon
shown
in
an
empty
indigo
sky
stop
a
minute
israfil
said
the
boy
and
turn
your
head
who
does
it
make
you
think
of
old
chrome
the
tenor
answered
looking
over
his
shoulder
it
is
perfect
the
river
was
quite
narrow
here
and
on
either
side
were
long
lines
of
moored
to
the
bank
and
an
occasional
flat
for
the
night
with
its
big
brown
sails
looking
like
webbed
wings
hoisted
to
dry
further
on
they
met
a
barge
coming
up
the
river
and
the
boy
wished
the
man
who
was
steering
a
polite
and
hoped
he
have
a
pleasant
passage
and
no
bad
weather
to
which
piece
of
facetiousness
the
bargee
replied
having
mistaken
the
boy
contralto
for
a
woman
voice
an
error
of
judgment
at
which
the
latter
affected
to
rage
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
tenor
but
they
were
out
of
the
city
by
this
time
on
their
right
was
a
gentleman
park
and
sloping
up
from
the
river
to
a
gentle
eminence
crowned
by
a
crest
of
trees
on
their
left
across
some
fields
the
villas
of
that
pleasant
suburb
before
mentioned
studded
the
rising
ground
appearing
also
among
old
trees
beneath
which
they
and
their
quiet
gardens
nestled
peacefully
there
were
trees
everywhere
beech
and
laburnum
and
larch
horsechestnut
and
lime
and
poplar
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
the
latter
standing
straight
up
in
the
barer
spots
were
a
notable
feature
in
the
landscape
as
were
also
the
and
occasional
osier
beds
dotted
about
in
marshy
places
the
pleasant
suburb
straggled
out
to
an
ancient
village
past
which
a
reach
of
the
river
wound
but
the
boy
kept
the
boat
to
the
main
stream
they
could
see
the
village
street
however
with
the
quaint
church
on
the
level
and
light
warm
airs
brought
them
odours
of
roses
and
mignonette
from
the
gardens
it
had
been
a
long
pull
for
a
hot
night
and
the
tenor
shipped
his
oars
here
and
threw
himself
back
in
the
bow
to
rest
he
lay
looking
up
at
the
sky
while
they
drifted
back
little
by
little
with
the
tide
the
balmy
air
the
of
the
water
against
the
boat
the
rock
and
sway
and
sense
of
dreamy
movement
and
ever
and
anon
the
nightingales
made
a
time
of
soft
excitement
such
as
the
boy
loved
o
israfil
he
burst
out
is
it
delicious
just
to
be
alive
he
was
lolling
in
the
stern
with
his
hat
off
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
and
a
tiller
rope
in
each
hand
the
image
of
indolent
ease
yes
this
is
perfect
he
added
it
is
paradise
not
for
you
i
should
think
said
the
tenor
without
an
eve
now
there
you
mistake
me
the
boy
replied
if
there
be
one
thing
i
deprecate
more
than
another
it
is
the
impertinent
intrusion
of
into
everything
you
surprise
me
the
tenor
answered
idly
when
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
love
was
a
favourite
topic
of
yours
ah
at
that
time
yes
said
the
boy
you
see
i
was
merely
pandering
then
to
what
i
supposed
to
be
your
taste
in
order
to
ingratiate
myself
with
you
but
you
may
have
noticed
that
since
i
knew
you
better
i
have
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
except
of
course
when
i
wanted
to
draw
you
that
is
true
said
the
tenor
upon
reflection
and
yet
you
are
the
most
sensuous
little
brute
i
know
sensuous
yes
not
sensual
said
the
boy
i
take
my
pleasures
daintily
and
this
scene
satisfies
me
heart
and
soul
balmy
air
moonlight
with
its
myriad
associations
a
murmurous
multitude
of
sounds
like
sighs
all
soothing
the
silent
drift
and
gentle
rocking
of
the
boat
and
the
calm
human
fellowship
the
brotherly
love
undisturbed
by
a
single
violent
emotion
which
is
the
perfection
of
social
intercourse
to
me
i
say
the
scene
is
hallowed
and
i
have
no
sex
in
my
paradise
the
last
words
were
uttered
irritably
and
he
sat
up
as
he
spoke
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
frowned
at
the
silvery
surface
of
the
river
love
he
ejaculated
rot
it
is
not
love
they
mean
but
do
let
us
desecrate
a
night
like
this
with
any
idea
that
lowers
us
to
the
level
of
a
beastly
french
novel
reeking
with
sensuality
amen
with
all
my
heart
said
the
tenor
lazily
but
do
introduce
the
disturbing
element
of
violence
either
dear
boy
your
sentiments
may
be
refined
but
the
same
can
not
be
said
for
the
expressions
in
which
you
clothe
them
in
fact
to
describe
the
latter
i
do
think
would
be
too
strong
a
word
no
not
coarse
said
the
boy
with
his
uncanny
grin
vigorous
you
mean
dear
but
now
shut
up
i
want
to
think
you
do
you
want
to
feel
said
the
tenor
the
boy
threw
his
cap
at
him
then
they
resettled
themselves
lolling
luxuriously
the
one
in
the
bows
the
other
in
the
stern
and
the
tenor
soul
was
uplifted
as
was
the
case
with
him
in
every
pause
of
life
to
the
heaven
of
heavens
which
only
could
contain
it
while
the
boy
roamed
away
to
realms
of
poesy
where
it
revelled
amid
blossoming
rhymes
or
rested
satisfied
on
full
blown
verses
some
of
which
he
presently
began
to
chant
to
himself
monotonously
i
like
that
he
broke
off
at
last
there
is
quite
an
idea
in
it
well
worked
out
too
do
you
think
so
what
is
the
thing
the
tenor
asked
who
wrote
it
i
wrote
it
myself
said
the
boy
the
tenor
roused
himself
and
got
out
the
oars
but
sat
resting
on
them
with
a
look
in
his
dreamy
eyes
he
was
bareheaded
and
the
moon
played
on
his
yellow
hair
making
it
shine
a
detail
which
did
not
escape
the
boy
whose
pleasure
in
the
tenor
beauty
never
tired
i
did
know
you
were
a
poet
as
well
as
a
musician
the
latter
said
at
last
ah
you
have
much
to
learn
the
boy
answered
complacently
then
added
i
am
extremely
versatile
jack
of
all
trades
said
the
tenor
now
do
be
coarse
said
the
boy
well
i
hope
that
is
not
the
best
specimen
of
your
powers
in
that
line
the
tenor
drily
pursued
by
no
means
was
the
candid
rejoinder
but
the
most
appropriate
seeing
that
i
just
made
it
for
the
occasion
which
is
not
a
great
occasion
you
know
i
heard
something
very
like
it
before
said
the
tenor
yes
said
the
boy
with
a
gratified
smile
is
the
beauty
of
it
there
is
no
nonsense
about
me
my
verses
always
tremble
with
agreeable
reminiscences
they
set
the
sensitive
sympathetic
chords
of
memory
vibrating
pleasurably
you
can
hardly
read
anything
i
write
without
being
reminded
of
some
one
or
other
of
your
best
friends
in
the
language
i
have
written
some
verses
which
i
can
assure
you
were
a
triumph
of
this
art
he
made
an
artistic
pause
here
shook
his
head
and
then
ejaculated
solemnly
but
lord
how
i
did
rage
when
the
fact
was
first
pointed
out
to
me
the
tenor
got
the
boat
round
and
with
an
occasional
dip
of
the
oars
to
keep
it
in
allowed
it
to
drift
slowly
back
toward
morningquest
i
am
afraid
you
are
precocious
boy
he
said
at
last
do
be
so
if
you
can
help
it
the
thing
is
detestable
i
really
think
i
shall
be
obliged
to
avoid
you
israfil
the
boy
rejoined
if
i
let
you
be
intimate
you
will
be
giving
me
good
advice
look
there
the
tenor
turned
hastily
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
it
was
only
that
they
had
reached
a
point
from
which
they
could
obtain
a
view
that
pleased
the
boy
excitable
fancy
a
bend
of
the
river
a
glimpse
of
upland
meadows
woods
with
the
cathedral
spire
above
them
and
the
square
outline
of
the
castle
overhanging
the
city
from
its
dominant
site
on
the
hill
and
seeming
to
guard
it
as
it
slept
the
tenor
looked
a
little
then
dipped
his
oars
and
rowed
a
stroke
or
two
the
boy
mood
had
changed
he
was
keenly
susceptible
to
the
refining
influences
of
beautiful
scenes
his
countenance
cleared
and
softened
as
he
gazed
and
the
tenor
knew
that
he
would
jeer
no
more
that
night
presently
they
heard
the
city
clocks
striking
the
hour
both
listened
waiting
for
the
chime
the
tenor
rested
on
his
oars
and
after
it
had
sounded
muffled
by
distance
but
quite
distinct
he
still
sat
so
gazing
thoughtfully
into
the
water
boy
shall
i
tell
you
something
he
said
at
last
the
boy
gravely
responded
with
a
nod
it
was
not
far
from
where
we
are
now
the
tenor
continued
that
i
first
heard
the
chime
oh
ever
so
many
years
ago
and
he
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
you
were
a
boy
then
yes
a
lad
like
you
perhaps
younger
i
had
been
working
in
a
colliery
the
work
was
too
hard
for
me
and
i
was
coming
up
the
morne
on
a
barge
to
try
and
get
something
lighter
to
do
in
one
of
the
towns
we
came
up
very
slowly
and
it
was
a
hot
day
and
i
idled
about
for
hours
looking
at
the
water
over
the
side
and
at
the
banks
of
the
river
as
we
passed
but
without
thinking
of
anything
what
i
saw
made
me
feel
i
was
conscious
of
various
sensations
pleasure
wonder
amusement
and
above
all
of
a
dreamful
ease
but
i
could
not
translate
sensations
into
words
at
that
time
they
suggested
no
ideas
there
had
been
nothing
in
my
life
so
far
to
rouse
my
mental
faculties
and
i
was
conscious
without
being
intelligent
as
i
suppose
the
beasts
of
the
field
are
i
must
have
been
happy
then
but
i
did
not
know
it
as
we
approached
morningquest
i
heard
the
chime
it
was
very
faint
at
first
for
we
were
still
a
long
way
off
but
the
next
time
it
sounded
we
were
nearer
and
the
next
it
was
quite
distinct
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
mean
something
so
i
asked
the
old
bargee
who
was
steering
and
he
told
me
i
could
neither
read
nor
write
at
that
time
and
i
had
never
heard
of
christ
but
i
loved
music
and
the
idea
of
a
great
beneficent
being
who
slumbered
not
nor
slept
but
watched
over
us
all
forever
took
possession
of
my
imagination
and
i
caught
up
the
notes
and
words
and
sang
them
with
all
my
heart
and
when
we
got
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
a
gentleman
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
sketching
the
old
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
heard
me
and
hailed
the
barge
and
came
on
board
is
your
sweet
singer
he
asked
and
the
old
fellow
who
was
steering
nodded
toward
me
and
answered
lad
there
and
the
gentleman
said
if
i
would
go
away
with
him
he
would
have
me
taught
music
and
make
a
great
singer
of
me
and
you
went
yes
said
the
tenor
with
his
habitual
gesture
the
gentleman
was
a
bachelor
he
resumed
with
few
near
relations
he
was
very
rich
very
liberal
and
passionately
fond
of
art
in
all
its
branches
that
was
why
he
took
me
at
first
but
by
and
by
he
began
to
like
me
for
myself
he
had
me
educated
as
his
own
son
might
have
been
and
i
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
father
oh
boy
he
was
a
good
man
you
never
would
have
scoffed
at
religion
and
truth
had
you
been
brought
up
by
him
i
rested
on
his
affection
as
securely
as
you
rely
on
the
obligation
of
your
nearest
of
kin
i
knew
that
even
if
i
had
lost
my
voice
or
otherwise
disappointed
him
it
would
have
made
no
difference
once
my
friend
he
would
always
have
been
my
friend
but
i
did
not
lose
my
voice
nor
did
i
otherwise
disappoint
him
i
trust
the
tenor
paused
a
moment
he
was
always
sure
that
i
was
gentle
by
birth
he
resumed
and
all
my
tutors
said
i
must
have
come
of
an
educated
race
because
i
was
so
teachable
everything
in
the
new
life
came
to
me
naturally
i
never
had
any
trouble
my
friend
tried
hard
to
find
my
parents
but
all
that
was
known
of
me
in
the
place
i
came
from
was
that
a
collier
who
lived
alone
in
a
little
cottage
went
home
late
one
night
and
found
me
asleep
on
his
bed
they
thought
i
was
only
a
few
days
old
then
and
had
kept
my
clothes
which
were
such
as
a
gentleman
child
would
have
worn
but
there
was
no
mark
on
any
of
them
nor
any
clue
by
which
i
could
be
identified
except
the
name
david
julian
vanetemple
scrawled
on
a
scrap
of
paper
in
a
woman
hand
an
educated
hand
the
collier
brought
me
up
somehow
though
heaven
alone
knows
how
considering
my
age
and
his
own
occupation
do
you
know
boy
one
of
the
most
weary
things
in
life
is
the
sense
of
an
obligation
you
can
never
repay
if
i
could
only
have
done
something
to
prove
my
gratitude
to
my
first
foster
father
but
there
i
must
not
think
of
it
it
is
better
to
hope
that
all
he
did
for
me
was
a
pleasure
to
himself
at
the
time
though
there
must
have
been
much
more
trouble
than
pleasure
at
first
but
he
was
very
kind
and
i
was
very
happy
with
him
here
the
tenor
paused
again
for
a
while
and
then
resumed
when
i
was
old
enough
he
took
me
down
to
the
pit
occasionally
but
he
would
not
let
me
work
until
i
was
much
past
the
age
at
which
the
other
boys
began
he
said
i
was
not
one
of
them
my
build
was
different
and
i
was
quite
unfit
for
such
rough
labour
and
so
it
proved
but
i
persevered
as
long
as
he
lived
it
was
not
very
long
however
for
he
was
killed
one
day
by
an
explosion
of
gas
down
in
the
mine
while
trying
to
rescue
some
other
poor
fellows
who
had
been
blocked
up
in
a
gallery
for
days
by
a
fall
his
dog
was
killed
at
the
same
time
he
liked
to
have
his
family
with
him
he
said
and
we
were
generally
both
beside
him
when
he
was
at
work
but
he
sent
me
off
on
an
impossible
errand
to
a
neighbouring
town
that
day
i
did
not
suspect
it
at
the
time
but
i
know
now
that
it
was
to
keep
me
out
of
harm
way
and
so
i
was
left
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
i
thought
the
place
where
i
had
had
a
friend
was
more
desolate
than
strange
places
with
which
i
had
no
such
tender
associations
would
be
and
so
i
wandered
away
and
wandered
about
until
i
was
found
by
my
next
friend
on
the
barge
and
the
new
life
began
for
me
then
he
never
found
out
who
you
were
the
boy
exclaimed
no
never
and
why
did
you
leave
him
the
tenor
shipped
his
oars
he
had
a
place
in
scotland
to
which
we
went
every
autumn
for
shooting
he
began
to
answer
indirectly
and
then
stopped
the
boy
was
leaning
forward
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
tenor
face
his
delicate
features
were
pale
and
drawn
with
excitement
and
interest
his
lips
were
parted
he
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
there
was
a
long
pause
the
moonlight
still
streamed
down
upon
them
the
water
lapped
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
sparkled
and
rippled
all
around
them
its
murmurs
mingling
with
the
rustle
of
leaves
the
sighing
of
sleeping
cattle
the
manifold
inarticulate
voices
of
the
night
above
which
a
nightingale
in
a
copse
hard
by
sang
out
at
intervals
divinely
my
friend
was
not
conventional
in
anything
the
tenor
began
again
at
last
when
he
went
out
shooting
for
instance
he
liked
to
find
his
own
game
as
he
would
have
had
to
do
in
the
wilds
all
the
sport
of
the
thing
lay
in
that
he
said
it
was
just
the
difference
between
nature
and
artifice
we
were
therefore
in
the
habit
of
going
out
alone
that
is
to
say
with
a
keeper
or
two
and
the
dogs
but
never
with
a
party
here
again
the
tenor
paused
and
all
the
minor
murmurs
of
the
water
and
from
the
land
sounded
aggressively
with
that
sort
of
sound
which
fills
the
ears
but
seems
nevertheless
to
emphasize
the
silence
and
solitude
at
night
the
boy
moved
restlessly
once
or
twice
making
the
little
boat
rock
and
the
tenor
yielding
to
the
eager
expectancy
he
saw
in
his
eyes
resumed
his
story
toward
the
end
of
the
season
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
he
said
we
had
arranged
an
expedition
for
one
particular
morning
but
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
my
friend
got
a
telegram
from
a
man
he
knew
begging
him
as
a
favour
to
be
at
home
that
day
to
receive
a
yachting
party
who
were
anxious
to
come
up
and
see
the
place
and
had
only
a
few
hours
to
do
it
in
i
wanted
to
stay
and
help
him
to
entertain
them
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
my
day
shooting
was
of
more
consequence
to
him
than
the
entertainment
of
many
guests
and
he
made
me
go
alone
but
i
went
reluctantly
i
had
been
out
alone
often
enough
before
and
had
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
but
that
day
somehow
i
hated
to
leave
him
and
only
went
to
please
him
he
made
such
a
point
of
it
once
fairly
started
however
i
began
as
was
natural
to
enjoy
the
tramp
over
the
moors
we
intended
to
send
back
for
any
game
we
might
shoot
so
only
one
old
gillie
accompanied
me
i
carried
out
the
plans
we
had
made
the
night
before
going
the
way
we
had
intended
to
go
it
was
deer
i
was
after
and
as
luck
would
have
it
i
had
some
splendid
sport
and
had
begun
to
enter
into
it
thoroughly
before
we
halted
to
refresh
ourselves
at
noon
after
a
long
rest
we
set
off
again
up
a
wooded
glen
the
keeper
had
noticed
a
herd
of
deer
only
the
day
before
feeding
at
the
other
side
and
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
we
should
get
a
shot
when
we
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
or
we
might
perhaps
meet
some
of
them
coming
down
the
glen
to
drink
the
afternoon
was
waning
then
and
we
had
turned
our
faces
homeward
when
we
got
to
the
head
of
the
glen
the
luck
seemed
still
to
be
favouring
us
for
there
on
our
right
was
a
splendid
fellow
lording
it
alone
on
the
very
crest
of
the
hill
within
range
i
did
not
stop
to
consider
but
raised
my
gun
to
my
shoulder
and
fired
instantly
but
just
as
i
pulled
the
trigger
someone
sprang
up
from
the
heather
between
me
and
the
stag
sprang
up
uttered
a
cry
and
reeled
and
fell
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
a
gasp
and
the
tenor
stopped
for
an
instant
and
then
continued
in
a
hoarse
broken
whisper
to
which
his
companion
had
to
listen
intently
leaning
forward
to
do
so
with
his
great
eyes
dilated
and
his
pale
lips
quivering
sir
the
gillie
exclaimed
shot
the
master
and
you
had
i
had
yes
i
had
shot
him
the
tenor
repeated
o
israfil
cried
the
boy
flinging
himself
down
impetuously
before
him
and
grasping
his
hands
when
his
guests
had
gone
the
latter
continued
in
a
broken
voice
he
strolled
out
to
meet
me
he
had
not
said
anything
about
coming
but
he
knew
i
meant
to
return
by
that
glen
he
did
not
however
know
on
which
side
i
should
be
and
he
had
therefore
taken
up
his
position
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
from
whence
he
could
see
every
point
at
which
i
was
likely
to
appear
probably
he
never
saw
the
stag
it
was
behind
him
and
we
the
gillie
and
i
neither
of
us
saw
anything
else
and
indeed
had
there
been
no
game
we
could
hardly
have
distinguished
him
at
that
time
of
the
day
from
the
hillside
till
he
moved
for
the
suit
he
wore
was
just
the
colour
of
the
rocks
and
heather
we
carried
him
home
but
he
was
dead
dead
quite
dead
and
the
tenor
moaned
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
i
remember
now
the
boy
said
softly
i
heard
all
about
it
at
the
time
and
read
the
case
in
the
papers
but
i
never
thought
of
associating
it
with
you
yet
how
could
i
have
been
so
dull
there
was
an
inquest
and
they
tried
he
hesitated
they
tried
to
make
out
that
i
had
some
motive
something
to
gain
by
his
death
the
tenor
went
on
but
everyone
and
most
of
all
his
nearest
of
kin
his
heir
came
forward
to
exonerate
me
he
had
provided
for
me
in
his
will
by
settling
the
allowance
he
always
made
me
on
me
and
my
heirs
forever
but
he
always
said
that
my
voice
was
my
fortune
and
he
had
no
need
to
make
enemies
for
me
by
giving
me
that
which
belonged
by
right
to
others
he
was
a
just
man
singularly
open
in
all
his
dealings
and
it
was
not
hard
to
clear
me
but
still
oh
he
broke
off
it
was
awful
awful
and
afterward
the
boy
ventured
to
ask
afterward
the
tenor
repeated
slowly
afterward
for
some
months
i
wandered
about
they
were
all
very
kind
they
wanted
me
to
stay
with
them
they
wanted
to
take
me
abroad
they
would
have
done
anything
to
help
and
comfort
me
but
all
i
cared
for
was
to
be
alone
at
first
there
was
a
blank
the
faces
about
me
had
no
meaning
for
me
the
people
when
they
spoke
could
scarcely
make
me
understand
i
was
mad
in
a
way
but
not
mad
enough
to
be
insensible
to
sorrow
i
felt
the
fearful
calamity
that
had
fallen
upon
me
but
nothing
else
i
told
myself
every
hour
of
the
day
that
he
was
dead
dead
cruelly
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
his
happy
life
by
me
whom
he
loved
i
could
not
have
suffered
more
had
i
been
guilty
the
tenor
broke
off
this
lasted
i
hardly
know
how
long
but
eventually
i
began
to
fancy
that
he
saw
my
agony
of
grief
and
that
it
was
a
torment
to
him
not
to
be
able
to
come
and
comfort
me
then
one
day
i
was
in
cornwall
at
the
time
sitting
on
the
sea
shore
and
all
at
once
it
was
the
strangest
thing
in
life
i
heard
the
chime
i
had
not
been
thinking
of
it
i
doubt
if
i
had
thought
of
it
a
dozen
times
since
i
heard
it
first
but
it
sounded
for
me
then
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
i
heard
it
quite
distinctly
and
i
got
up
and
looked
about
me
it
was
the
first
thing
outside
myself
that
had
arrested
my
attention
since
i
had
seen
him
drop
on
the
moor
i
went
back
to
the
inn
i
was
staying
at
and
asked
about
it
but
i
could
scarcely
make
them
understand
what
i
meant
and
there
was
certainly
no
such
chime
in
that
neighbourhood
then
i
felt
it
was
a
message
sent
specially
to
me
and
i
made
my
man
pack
up
my
things
and
then
i
dismissed
him
and
started
at
once
for
morningquest
alone
it
was
a
long
journey
and
although
i
travelled
with
all
possible
speed
i
did
not
arrive
until
nearly
hours
later
it
was
close
on
midnight
then
and
the
first
thing
i
heard
when
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
room
at
the
hotel
was
the
chime
itself
have
you
ever
noticed
or
is
it
only
my
fancy
that
it
seems
to
strike
louder
at
midnight
and
with
greater
intensity
of
expression
as
we
ourselves
strike
final
chords
it
sounded
so
to
me
then
and
suggested
something
i
ca
tell
what
i
define
it
but
something
that
changed
the
current
of
my
thoughts
and
made
me
feel
i
had
done
right
to
come
and
from
that
moment
my
grief
was
less
and
the
blessed
power
to
feel
for
others
began
to
return
to
me
almost
immediately
after
my
arrival
i
heard
of
the
tragedy
in
the
cathedral
the
suicide
of
the
tenor
and
the
trouble
the
dean
and
chapter
were
having
to
find
a
substitute
and
when
i
had
seen
the
quiet
shady
close
and
the
beautiful
old
cathedral
and
my
little
house
with
its
garden
at
the
back
standing
as
it
were
on
holy
ground
i
longed
to
take
up
my
abode
there
where
no
one
would
know
my
story
but
those
to
whom
the
secret
would
be
sacred
and
no
one
would
intrude
upon
my
grief
so
i
applied
for
the
tenor
place
and
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
had
taken
the
step
that
it
was
a
wise
one
i
thought
if
any
thing
could
restore
the
balance
of
my
mind
it
would
be
the
regular
employment
the
quiet
monotony
the
something
to
do
that
i
must
do
the
duty
and
obligation
which
were
just
sufficient
without
being
any
tax
on
my
powers
to
take
me
out
of
myself
and
the
being
able
to
shut
myself
up
from
the
world
in
the
close
as
i
said
before
was
another
inducement
though
by
far
the
greatest
were
the
daily
services
in
the
cathedral
while
taking
part
in
them
i
always
feel
that
i
am
nearer
him
when
i
applied
for
the
place
and
the
dean
heard
who
i
was
of
course
he
knew
the
story
the
whole
world
knew
it
at
that
time
and
heard
how
i
yearned
for
a
life
of
devotion
he
sympathized
with
me
entirely
gladly
acceded
to
my
request
and
agreed
to
keep
my
secret
he
has
told
me
since
that
he
always
hoped
and
believed
the
quiet
regular
life
would
restore
me
and
when
it
had
he
intended
to
urge
me
to
go
away
and
make
the
most
of
my
powers
dear
kind
old
man
he
has
indeed
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
he
is
a
good
man
himself
if
ever
there
were
one
but
i
seem
to
have
known
none
but
good
men
the
tenor
concluded
thoughtfully
but
your
money
israfil
the
boy
said
impatiently
what
did
you
do
with
that
the
question
provoked
the
ghost
of
a
smile
oh
boy
that
is
so
like
you
the
tenor
answered
but
since
you
wish
to
know
i
will
tell
you
my
income
has
all
been
disposed
of
for
some
years
to
come
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
i
should
have
required
in
any
case
and
a
lay
clerk
with
such
means
would
have
been
an
anomaly
not
to
be
tolerated
but
he
meant
that
i
should
enjoy
it
and
so
i
have
i
have
held
it
as
a
sacred
trust
left
to
me
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
worse
off
than
myself
i
keep
the
principal
in
my
own
hands
but
i
dispose
of
the
interest
it
does
not
go
very
far
alas
in
my
profession
where
want
is
the
rule
but
it
enables
me
to
do
something
and
that
till
i
knew
you
boy
was
my
greatest
pleasure
in
life
i
have
earned
my
own
living
almost
ever
since
i
came
to
morningquest
and
being
obliged
to
do
so
has
been
a
very
good
thing
for
me
and
all
these
pensioners
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
them
of
yours
do
they
know
as
a
rule
my
lawyers
manage
the
business
delicately
the
tenor
answered
smiling
he
dipped
his
oars
as
he
spoke
and
began
to
row
back
with
a
will
the
boy
shivering
as
if
with
cold
gathered
up
the
tiller
lines
and
steered
mechanically
they
were
both
subdued
and
scarcely
spoke
till
the
boat
touched
the
landing
place
at
the
and
then
the
boy
begged
the
tenor
to
get
out
saying
that
he
must
row
himself
home
the
tenor
jumped
ashore
and
then
with
a
long
grip
of
each
other
hands
and
a
long
look
into
each
other
eyes
they
parted
in
silence
the
moon
had
set
by
this
time
and
the
summer
dawn
was
near
chapter
xiv
the
next
night
the
boy
appeared
again
in
his
white
boating
suit
with
his
sandy
hair
tumbled
more
than
usual
his
restless
eyes
sparkled
and
glanced
and
there
was
a
glow
beneath
his
clear
skin
which
answered
in
his
to
a
heightened
colour
in
other
complexions
he
was
evidently
excited
about
something
and
the
tenor
thought
he
had
never
seen
him
look
so
well
what
his
mood
was
did
not
become
immediately
apparent
the
tenor
had
learnt
that
the
sparkle
in
his
eyes
either
meant
some
mischievous
design
or
a
strong
desire
to
make
music
but
this
evening
he
was
long
in
coming
to
the
point
he
began
by
pelting
the
tenor
with
roses
through
the
window
and
then
he
entered
and
danced
an
impromptu
breakdown
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
these
preliminaries
might
have
been
an
introduction
to
anything
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
programme
were
not
complete
for
he
next
subsided
into
his
accustomed
seat
on
the
sofa
up
against
the
wall
opposite
the
fireplace
and
remained
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
at
the
tenor
thoughtfully
for
at
least
ten
minutes
the
tenor
was
also
in
his
accustomed
seat
beside
the
hearth
or
rather
beside
the
stand
of
growing
flowers
and
ferns
that
hid
the
hearth
with
a
book
on
his
knee
he
was
sitting
there
when
the
first
rose
whizzed
in
out
of
the
silence
and
solitude
of
night
without
warning
upon
him
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
boy
it
startled
him
somewhat
but
he
did
not
wince
from
the
shower
that
followed
nor
did
he
move
when
the
boy
chose
to
show
himself
but
merely
smiled
and
closed
his
book
and
then
sat
watching
the
next
part
of
the
proceedings
with
the
gravity
of
an
eastern
potentate
he
sat
so
now
looking
up
at
the
great
cathedral
seen
dimly
through
the
open
window
towering
above
them
his
profile
turned
to
the
boy
and
the
roses
all
about
him
on
the
floor
on
the
back
of
his
chair
one
on
his
shoulder
another
on
his
book
and
one
he
held
in
his
hand
there
were
dozens
of
them
of
every
hue
from
that
deep
crimson
damask
which
is
almost
black
to
the
purest
white
fresh
gathered
from
the
trees
apparently
with
the
dew
still
glistening
on
their
perfumed
petals
and
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
leaves
the
tenor
becoming
conscious
of
the
de
he
held
in
his
hand
looked
into
its
creamy
depth
with
quiet
eyes
the
beauty
of
the
flower
was
a
pleasure
to
him
though
for
the
matter
of
that
everything
was
a
pleasure
to
him
now
he
had
no
words
to
tell
it
but
his
face
was
irradiated
by
the
gladness
of
the
hope
which
he
cherished
from
morning
till
night
the
boy
had
been
watching
him
admiringly
you
will
be
one
of
the
beauties
when
you
come
out
dear
israfil
he
said
they
will
photograph
you
and
put
you
into
the
shop
windows
cabinet
size
sounds
rather
vulgar
though
does
it
savours
of
desecration
to
my
mind
but
israfil
you
will
certainly
be
the
rage
one
so
seldom
sees
a
man
women
are
common
enough
and
they
make
themselves
still
commoner
nowadays
which
remark
coming
from
such
a
quarter
amused
the
tenor
whereupon
the
boy
became
irate
oh
jeer
away
he
exclaimed
but
when
you
know
angelica
as
well
as
i
do
you
will
respect
my
knowledge
of
the
subject
but
here
the
tenor
threw
back
his
head
and
groaned
aloud
boy
i
protest
he
exclaimed
i
can
endure
your
garrulousness
but
i
do
bar
your
cynicism
if
you
ca
be
agreeable
be
still
you
in
a
horrid
bad
temper
and
so
saying
the
tenor
rose
in
his
languid
way
got
a
little
table
which
he
placed
beside
his
chair
spread
out
his
pipes
upon
it
and
began
to
clean
them
with
crows
quills
the
boy
watching
the
operation
the
while
with
cheerful
intentness
pipes
and
tobacco
and
roses
he
said
at
last
what
a
mixture
it
sounds
but
it
does
look
bad
dear
israfil
he
added
encouragingly
the
tenor
made
no
remark
his
pipes
seemed
to
be
all
engrossing
he
had
just
filled
the
bowl
of
one
with
a
number
of
fuseeheads
cut
off
short
and
now
he
popped
in
a
light
and
corked
them
up
there
was
a
tiny
explosion
on
the
instant
followed
by
a
rush
of
smoke
through
the
shank
of
the
pipe
which
swept
it
clean
and
added
musk
and
gunpowder
to
the
already
heavy
odour
of
roses
that
filled
the
room
the
boy
still
lolling
on
the
sofa
observing
the
tenor
proceedings
with
interest
drew
up
one
leg
clasping
his
hands
round
it
below
the
knee
and
began
to
sing
to
himself
in
a
monotonous
undertone
as
was
his
wont
the
tenor
said
like
one
who
suddenly
remembers
i
found
some
verses
after
you
were
here
the
other
night
and
he
straightened
himself
to
feel
in
his
pockets
i
suppose
you
dropped
them
here
they
are
and
then
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
again
and
read
aloud
when
the
winter
storms
were
howling
the
ocean
leafless
trees
and
sombre
landscape
cold
and
drear
bitter
winds
and
driving
rains
or
white
commotion
of
the
whirling
snow
that
drifted
far
and
near
then
my
heart
which
had
been
strong
was
bowed
and
broken
i
was
crushed
with
sudden
sense
of
loss
and
fear
dull
as
silence
passed
the
days
and
brought
no
token
of
a
light
to
make
the
darkness
disappear
would
the
grief
that
wrecked
my
life
forever
hold
me
soon
or
later
winter
storms
their
ravage
cease
with
the
coming
of
the
green
leaves
something
told
me
with
the
coming
of
the
green
leaves
there
is
peace
when
the
bursting
buds
proclaim
the
spring
time
nearing
song
of
birds
and
scent
of
flowers
everywhere
drowsy
drone
of
distant
workers
and
the
cheering
hum
of
bees
in
all
the
air
then
my
sorrow
took
swift
wings
and
rose
and
left
me
and
i
knew
no
more
the
aching
of
despair
came
again
to
me
the
joy
that
seemed
bereft
me
and
for
hope
i
changed
the
dreary
weight
of
care
with
the
winter
tempests
pass
the
storms
of
feeling
soon
and
surely
did
their
power
to
pain
me
cease
and
the
summer
rose
revealing
with
the
coming
of
the
green
leaves
there
is
peace
the
tenor
looked
at
the
boy
when
he
had
finished
shook
his
head
mournfully
struck
a
match
set
fire
to
the
paper
upon
which
the
verses
were
written
and
watched
it
burn
with
the
air
of
a
disappointed
man
do
make
any
more
rhymes
boy
he
said
do
write
any
more
at
least
until
you
get
out
of
the
sickly
sentimental
stage
i
thought
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
but
i
really
never
imagined
anything
quite
so
bad
as
that
the
boy
although
he
had
listened
to
the
lines
with
a
fine
affectation
of
enjoyment
was
in
no
way
discomposed
by
the
tenor
adverse
criticism
he
seemed
on
the
contrary
to
enjoy
that
too
for
he
chuckled
and
hugged
himself
ecstatically
before
he
replied
i
should
like
to
know
he
said
with
his
uncanny
grin
how
you
found
out
those
lines
were
mine
for
i
certainly
never
told
you
that
i
wrote
them
the
tenor
mind
misgave
him
did
you
he
said
looking
at
the
ashes
the
boy
threw
himself
back
on
the
sofa
they
were
angelica
he
said
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
now
you
look
as
if
you
would
like
to
have
them
back
again
it
will
take
you
months
to
get
over
that
the
tenor
was
certainly
disconcerted
but
he
merely
resumed
his
pipe
folded
his
hands
and
looked
up
at
the
cathedral
he
had
been
blessed
all
his
life
with
the
precious
gift
of
silence
outside
the
night
was
very
still
there
was
a
fitful
little
breeze
which
rustled
the
leaves
and
made
the
creepers
tap
on
the
window
panes
but
beyond
this
there
was
no
sound
no
sign
of
life
or
movement
nothing
to
remind
them
of
the
whole
cityful
so
close
at
hand
the
tenor
lay
back
in
his
chair
looking
somewhat
dispirited
the
boy
got
up
and
began
to
wander
about
the
room
a
long
pause
followed
which
was
broken
by
the
chime
i
have
been
trying
to
say
something
all
the
evening
and
now
that
beastly
chime
has
gone
and
made
it
impossible
the
boy
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
could
hear
himself
speak
i
hate
it
i
loathe
it
it
is
cruel
as
eternal
damnation
it
is
condemnation
without
appeal
it
is
a
judgment
which
acknowledges
none
of
the
excuses
we
make
for
ourselves
i
wish
they
would
change
it
i
wish
they
would
make
it
say
have
mercy
christ
have
mercy
upon
us
the
tenor
put
down
his
pipe
rose
slowly
and
went
upstairs
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
in
flannels
you
want
exercise
boy
he
said
you
must
come
out
it
is
a
lovely
night
for
the
river
and
i
have
been
shut
up
in
the
close
all
day
the
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
yes
yes
he
exclaimed
with
animation
let
us
go
and
i
bring
my
violin
where
my
hat
you
came
without
one
or
perhaps
you
hung
it
on
the
palings
no
i
did
the
boy
replied
i
must
have
forgotten
it
altogether
but
it
does
matter
i
rather
be
without
one
i
always
take
it
off
when
i
can
so
i
have
seen
said
the
tenor
following
him
out
as
he
walked
through
the
close
still
a
little
behind
the
boy
he
could
not
help
noticing
by
no
means
for
the
first
time
but
more
particularly
than
usual
what
a
graceful
creature
the
latter
was
his
slender
figure
showed
to
advantage
in
the
light
flannels
they
made
him
look
broader
and
more
manly
while
leaving
room
for
the
free
play
of
limb
and
muscle
he
had
knotted
a
crimson
silk
scarf
round
his
neck
sailor
fashion
and
twisted
a
voluminous
cummerbund
of
the
same
round
his
waist
carelessly
so
that
one
heavily
fringed
end
of
it
came
loose
and
now
hung
down
to
his
knee
swaying
with
his
body
as
he
moved
the
tenor
remembered
that
his
socks
were
also
of
crimson
silk
a
detail
which
had
caught
his
eye
as
the
boy
lolled
on
the
sofa
it
was
evident
that
the
costume
had
cost
him
a
thought
and
if
somewhat
theatrical
it
was
certainly
picturesque
and
entirely
characteristic
in
one
respect
the
boy
art
was
perfect
although
he
was
quite
conscious
of
his
good
looks
he
never
had
the
air
of
being
so
every
movement
was
natural
and
spontaneous
like
the
movements
of
a
wild
creature
and
as
agile
he
seemed
to
rejoice
in
his
own
strength
to
delight
in
his
own
suppleness
and
he
walked
on
now
with
healthy
elastic
step
his
violin
held
to
his
shoulder
his
clear
cut
cheek
leant
down
to
it
lovingly
his
luxuriant
light
hair
all
tumbled
and
tossed
while
he
kept
time
to
an
imaginary
tune
with
the
bow
in
his
right
hand
now
flourishing
it
in
the
air
and
now
drawing
it
across
the
instrument
scarcely
seeming
to
touch
the
strings
yet
waking
low
ćolean
harplike
murmurs
or
deep
thrilling
tones
or
bright
melodious
cadences
making
it
respond
to
his
touch
like
a
living
creature
and
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
tenor
as
they
proceeded
with
a
joyous
face
as
if
sure
of
his
sympathy
but
anxious
to
see
if
he
had
it
all
the
same
i
feel
more
amiable
now
he
said
between
cadence
and
cadence
kindly
consider
that
i
have
cancelled
all
my
former
misstatements
cynicism
exist
in
a
healthy
sensorium
with
sounds
like
these
and
he
executed
a
magnificent
passage
on
his
violin
when
i
want
to
play
i
feel
that
i
must
prepare
myself
making
music
is
a
religious
rite
to
me
which
can
only
be
performed
by
one
in
perfect
charity
with
all
men
they
were
seated
in
the
boat
by
this
time
the
tenor
at
the
oars
row
brothers
row
the
boy
played
and
steer
yourself
he
said
i
can
do
nothing
but
accompany
you
and
then
he
began
in
earnest
while
the
tenor
made
the
boat
fly
past
river
bank
and
and
house
and
wharf
past
bridge
and
tower
and
town
it
seemed
but
a
flash
and
they
were
out
in
the
open
country
flat
meadows
on
the
left
and
on
their
right
the
green
and
swelling
upland
dotted
with
slumbrous
cattle
and
sheep
and
shadowy
with
the
heavy
summer
foliage
of
old
trees
the
tenor
stopped
there
exhausted
there
is
madness
in
your
music
boy
he
said
it
puts
me
beside
myself
the
boy
laughed
but
in
the
pause
that
followed
he
shivered
a
little
and
laid
aside
his
instrument
it
was
not
such
a
very
fine
night
on
the
river
as
it
had
appeared
to
be
in
the
close
the
moon
would
rise
later
but
at
present
there
was
no
sign
of
her
and
the
sky
though
cloudless
was
not
clear
the
colour
being
that
misty
opaque
gray
which
hangs
low
at
the
horizon
on
summer
nights
when
the
light
never
wholly
departs
and
is
accompanied
by
a
close
and
sultry
atmosphere
surcharged
with
electricity
the
harbinger
of
storms
it
was
so
that
night
there
were
no
stars
to
relieve
the
murky
heaviness
nor
was
it
dark
a
sort
of
twilight
reigned
as
comfortless
as
tepid
water
and
there
was
no
breeze
now
to
rustle
the
leaves
into
life
all
seemed
ghostly
still
save
for
the
muffled
rush
of
the
river
and
the
melancholy
howling
of
a
dog
at
some
farm
out
of
sight
and
even
the
river
was
not
its
usual
merry
self
but
a
sullen
heavy
body
that
slipped
by
stealthily
making
haste
to
the
sea
as
if
anxious
to
be
away
from
the
spot
without
a
ripple
to
break
its
level
surface
and
without
the
musical
lop
and
gurgle
and
murmur
with
which
it
danced
along
at
brighter
times
in
spite
of
the
heat
or
perhaps
because
of
it
the
air
was
full
of
moisture
and
while
the
tenor
rested
a
dead
white
mist
began
to
appear
above
the
meadows
it
rose
thinly
a
mere
film
at
first
which
coming
suddenly
would
have
made
a
man
brush
his
hand
over
his
eyes
mistaking
the
haze
for
some
defect
of
vision
but
gathering
and
gaining
body
rapidly
and
rising
a
certain
height
clear
from
the
ground
then
seeming
to
hover
a
thick
cloud
poised
between
earth
and
sky
not
touching
either
but
drawn
horizontally
over
the
fields
like
a
pall
with
ragged
edges
through
which
the
trees
showed
in
blurred
outline
their
leaves
dripping
miserably
with
an
intermittent
patter
of
uncertain
drops
as
the
moisture
collected
upon
them
and
fell
and
then
collected
again
the
fog
was
stationary
for
a
time
and
did
not
extend
beyond
the
meadows
but
it
rose
at
intervals
though
the
clearance
was
only
momentary
and
had
scarcely
become
perceptible
before
reinforcements
of
dull
white
vapour
tainted
with
miasma
rolled
up
from
the
marshy
ground
bringing
dank
odours
of
standing
water
and
weedy
vegetation
half
decayed
and
gradually
encroaching
on
the
river
the
smooth
surface
of
which
glowed
with
a
greasy
gleam
beneath
it
making
it
look
like
a
river
of
oil
let
us
go
back
said
the
boy
my
soul
is
sick
with
apprehension
and
the
damp
will
ruin
my
violin
i
thought
it
was
making
you
feel
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
the
tenor
observed
as
he
got
the
boat
round
the
boy
ruffled
his
flaxen
hair
and
laughed
uneasily
get
away
quick
he
said
if
the
elements
do
sympathize
with
man
there
be
a
tragedy
here
before
morning
the
tenor
pulled
on
steadily
and
in
silence
for
some
distance
but
once
out
of
sight
of
the
mist
and
the
meadows
the
boy
ever
varying
spirits
rose
again
he
took
up
his
violin
and
drew
soft
sounds
from
it
which
seemed
to
float
away
far
out
into
the
night
sing
something
he
said
at
last
playing
the
prelude
to
the
most
song
ever
written
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
the
tenor
sang
like
one
inspired
the
boy
uttered
a
deep
sigh
when
he
had
finished
he
was
speechless
with
pleasure
but
the
tenor
went
on
he
sang
of
the
sun
and
the
sea
gliding
from
one
strain
to
another
and
unconsciously
keeping
time
to
the
measure
as
he
rowed
now
making
the
little
boat
leap
forward
with
a
fine
impulse
now
almost
resting
on
his
oars
till
their
progress
through
the
water
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
now
stopping
altogether
while
he
lingered
on
a
closing
cadence
looking
up
people
who
chanced
to
wake
as
the
windings
of
the
river
brought
the
singer
past
their
homes
that
night
sat
up
in
their
beds
and
wondered
the
music
made
them
think
of
old
tales
of
weird
enchantment
in
which
strains
incomprehensibly
sweet
and
thrilling
like
these
coming
from
nobody
could
tell
where
had
played
a
part
and
one
poor
creature
who
had
long
been
dying
in
lingering
pain
thought
heaven
had
opened
for
her
and
smiling
passed
happily
away
it
would
have
been
no
great
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
have
supposed
that
nature
did
sympathize
with
man
in
his
moods
just
then
for
gradually
as
if
to
the
music
the
murky
clouds
had
parted
like
a
curtain
at
a
given
signal
and
rolled
away
leaving
the
vault
of
night
high
and
bare
and
blue
above
them
with
here
and
there
a
diamond
star
or
two
sparsely
sprinkled
from
horizon
to
zenith
radiant
at
first
but
presently
paling
before
a
slender
shaft
of
light
that
shot
up
in
the
east
and
then
opening
was
quickly
followed
by
the
great
golden
rim
of
the
moon
herself
she
rose
from
behind
a
hill
crested
with
fir
trees
which
appeared
for
a
moment
as
if
photographed
on
her
disc
and
then
mounting
rapidly
hung
suspended
in
a
clear
indigo
sky
above
the
quiet
woods
the
river
and
the
little
boat
which
was
motionless
now
an
ideal
moon
in
an
ideal
world
with
ideal
music
to
greet
her
but
the
boy
dropped
the
violin
on
his
knee
and
forgot
to
play
as
he
watched
this
beautiful
transformation
scene
and
the
tenor
song
sank
to
a
murmur
while
he
also
gazed
and
waited
dipping
his
oars
to
keep
the
boat
in
mechanically
joy
and
sadness
are
near
akin
in
music
they
are
like
pleasure
and
happiness
the
one
is
the
surface
of
feeling
the
other
its
depth
and
there
is
solemnity
in
every
phase
of
absolute
beauty
which
can
not
fail
to
influence
such
natures
as
the
tenor
and
the
boy
it
was
the
tenor
though
that
felt
this
moment
most
his
nature
if
not
deeper
was
more
devout
than
the
boy
pleasure
with
him
was
a
veritable
uplifting
of
the
spirit
in
praise
and
thankfulness
and
all
the
peace
and
quietness
about
them
the
marvellous
light
on
hill
and
wood
and
vale
and
even
the
nearness
of
the
unseen
city
which
he
felt
without
perceiving
it
and
from
which
there
came
to
him
that
sense
of
fellowship
and
of
the
sacredness
of
human
life
in
which
all
the
best
qualities
of
man
are
rooted
these
together
sanctified
the
time
although
for
the
matter
of
that
to
such
a
nature
all
times
and
seasons
are
sanctified
for
if
ever
a
man
soul
was
purified
on
earth
his
was
and
if
ever
a
man
deserved
to
see
heaven
he
did
humanly
speaking
there
was
no
stain
on
him
in
thought
word
and
deed
he
was
immaculate
and
true
as
a
little
child
this
moment
was
therefore
peculiarly
his
own
a
moment
of
deep
happiness
which
found
expression
as
all
pleasurable
emotion
did
with
him
in
music
he
lifted
up
his
voice
that
wonderful
voice
which
had
no
equal
then
upon
earth
and
sang
as
he
had
sung
once
before
on
that
very
spot
when
the
first
vague
idea
of
the
omnipresent
majesty
of
a
god
possessed
him
sang
with
all
his
heart
and
it
was
the
litany
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
one
he
had
heard
in
france
in
days
gone
by
the
one
he
had
been
singing
when
first
he
met
the
boy
which
recurred
to
him
now
why
or
wherefore
it
would
be
hard
to
say
he
had
not
thought
of
it
since
but
perhaps
the
moon
which
was
shining
again
as
it
had
shone
that
night
on
the
old
had
helped
to
recall
it
or
perhaps
it
satisfied
him
with
a
sense
of
appropriateness
for
it
was
not
a
dismal
monotonous
product
of
mercenary
dryness
to
which
the
words
were
set
but
the
characteristic
music
of
devotion
by
which
the
spirit
of
prayer
is
made
audible
when
words
fail
as
they
always
do
to
express
it
in
all
its
force
and
fervour
the
boy
listened
a
while
with
parted
lips
it
was
a
new
experience
for
him
and
he
was
deeply
moved
then
his
musical
instinct
awoke
and
presently
he
took
up
the
strain
voice
and
violin
accompanying
the
tenor
who
rowed
on
once
more
while
the
river
banks
resounded
with
christe
audi
nos
christe
exaudi
nos
and
miserere
nobis
at
one
point
as
they
approached
a
lady
appeared
suddenly
and
stood
with
her
hands
clasped
to
her
breast
looking
and
listening
she
was
a
tall
and
graceful
woman
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
and
bareheaded
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
from
somewhere
just
for
the
moment
she
evidently
recognized
the
singer
and
the
boy
would
have
recognized
the
beautiful
face
strong
in
its
calm
sad
serenity
and
compassionate
had
he
looked
that
way
but
he
did
not
look
that
way
and
they
swept
on
the
music
growing
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
till
at
last
the
boat
was
out
of
sight
yet
even
then
a
few
high
notes
continued
to
float
back
but
these
in
turn
quivered
into
silence
and
all
was
still
only
for
a
moment
though
for
the
clocks
had
struck
unheeded
and
now
the
chime
rang
out
through
the
sultry
air
clear
and
resonant

the
lady
listened
looking
up
as
if
the
message
were
for
her
but
sighed
it
will
come
right
i
know
she
said

she
turned

perfumed

the

exaltation

beyond
a
certain
time
at
that
height
and
then
comes
the
inevitable
reaction
it
came
upon
the
tenor
and
the
boy
quite
suddenly
and
for
no
apparent
reason
it
was
the
boy
who
felt
it
first
and
left
off
playing
then
the
song
ceased
and
the
tenor
rowed
on
diligently
they
were
near
the
landing
place
by
this
time
but
the
tenor
did
not
know
it
he
had
not
noticed
the
landmarks
as
they
passed
and
thought
they
had
still
some
distance
to
go
here
boy
he
said
breaking
a
long
silence
take
the
oars
and
row
i
am
tired
and
it
is
your
turn
now
oh
the
boy
exclaimed
derisively
just
as
if
i
would
row
and
blister
my
lovely
white
hands
when
you
are
here
to
row
me
i
can
not
tolerate
such
laziness
the
tenor
protested
it
is
sparing
the
rod
and
spoiling
the
child
here
take
the
oars
or
i
throw
you
overboard
and
he
made
a
gesture
toward
him
the
boy
jumped
up
laughing
and
flourishing
his
violin
as
if
he
would
hit
the
tenor
on
the
head
with
it
do
touch
me
he
cried
or
i
take
care
for
god
sake
the
tenor
exclaimed
but
too
late
his
excitable
companion
in
the
middle
of
cutting
a
fantastic
caper
reeled
lost
his
balance
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
water
and
sank
like
a
stone
without
a
moment
delay
the
tenor
dived
in
after
him
the
cockleshell
of
a
boat
half
capsizing
as
he
went
over
took
in
water
enough
to
sink
her
to
the
gunwale
and
the
whole
thing
happened
so
quickly
that
a
spectator
on
the
bank
who
had
seen
the
boat
and
its
occupants
one
moment
might
have
looked
in
vain
the
next
for
any
trace
of
either
the
tenor
came
to
the
surface
alone
his
dive
in
the
uncertain
light
had
been
unsuccessful
and
now
he
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
wait
in
what
agony
of
suspense
heaven
only
knows
till
the
boy
should
rise
it
could
only
have
been
a
few
seconds
but
it
was
long
enough
for
the
tenor
to
lay
another
man
death
at
his
own
door
to
realize
the
loss
to
himself
the
boy
would
be
and
his
position
when
he
would
have
to
take
the
dreadful
news
to
the
family
only
one
member
of
which
in
all
probability
knew
of
their
intimacy
she
knew
but
good
heaven
would
she
not
blame
him
oh
he
had
been
to
blame
to
blame
it
was
only
a
few
seconds
yet
it
was
time
enough
for
the
unfortunate
tenor
to
live
over
again
the
awful
moment
when
he
had
seen
his
best
friend
drop
dead
only
there
was
a
double
pang
for
time
and
space
were
confounded
and
it
was
as
if
both
father
and
brother
as
they
had
been
to
him
had
gone
down
at
once
and
both
by
his
hand
in
that
brief
interval
of
suffering
his
face
had
become
rigid
and
set
a
stony
mask
with
no
visible
sign
of
emotion
upon
it
and
yet
the
strength
and
power
of
endurance
were
evident
in
this
that
he
had
the
courage
to
wait
and
presently
the
boy
rose
to
the
surface
within
easy
reach
with
an
exclamation
of
relief
the
tenor
grasped
him
and
struck
out
for
the
shore
afraid
at
first
that
the
boy
who
apparently
could
not
swim
would
cling
about
him
in
his
fright
and
hamper
his
movements
and
then
afraid
because
the
boy
did
not
cling
about
him
but
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
through
the
water
inert
like
a
log
helpless
lifeless
no
not
lifeless
the
tenor
argued
with
himself
he
could
not
be
lifeless
you
know
he
had
not
been
in
the
water
long
enough
for
that
the
tenor
noticed
that
he
had
not
let
go
of
his
violin
and
thought
the
ruling
passion
strong
in
no
not
in
death
how
could
a
dead
hand
hold
on
like
that
boy
dear
boy
but
the
boy
made
no
response
the
tenor
had
struck
out
for
the
nearest
bank
which
as
luck
would
have
it
brought
him
to
the
landing
place
at
the
watergate
his
perception
seemed
singularly
quickened
every
sense
was
actively
alive
to
what
was
passing
nothing
escaped
him
and
he
rendered
an
account
to
himself
of
all
that
occurred
feeling
it
strange
the
while
that
he
should
be
able
to
do
so
at
such
a
time
he
noticed
some
detail
of
the
stonework
in
the
arch
as
he
swam
toward
it
he
noticed
the
poplars
some
three
or
four
of
different
heights
which
stood
up
all
stiff
and
vimineous
as
seen
from
below
beside
it
he
remembered
the
boy
once
saying
they
looked
like
hairy
caterpillars
standing
on
their
heads
and
smiled
even
now
at
the
quaint
conceit
when
he
reached
the
steps
and
clutched
the
handrail
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
joy
that
nearly
paralyzed
him
it
was
curious
though
what
odd
and
trivial
phrases
rose
to
his
lips
what
irrelevant
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
must
holloa
till
we
out
of
the
wood
he
warned
himself
as
he
drew
the
boy
from
the
water
with
difficulty
and
getting
him
over
his
shoulder
so
that
he
could
hold
him
with
one
hand
and
steady
himself
on
the
steep
steps
with
the
other
began
to
stagger
up
i
wonder
what
the
boy
would
say
if
he
could
see
me
now
was
his
involuntary
thought
as
he
did
so
the
boy
was
heavier
than
his
slender
figure
would
have
led
one
to
suppose
or
else
the
tenor
was
not
so
strong
as
he
thought
himself
at
all
events
he
swayed
under
his
burden
as
he
carried
him
through
the
silent
close
now
putting
out
his
hand
flat
against
a
wall
to
steady
himself
and
now
staggering
up
to
the
gnarled
trunk
of
one
of
the
old
lime
trees
and
pausing
to
take
breath
while
he
mentally
calculated
the
distance
between
that
and
the
next
support
at
which
he
could
stop
to
rest
noticing
in
the
brief
interval
the
blackness
of
the
shadows
noticing
also
a
little
shiver
of
leaves
above
him
caused
by
a
gust
of
air
the
first
forerunner
of
a
breeze
that
was
rapidly
rising
noticed
this
last
fact
particularly
partly
because
the
wind
chilled
him
in
his
thin
wet
flannels
and
partly
because
it
marked
the
change
and
contrast
between
the
warm
and
happy
time
just
over
the
anxious
present
moment
and
the
dread
of
what
might
be
yet
to
come
the
next
support
was
the
corner
of
the
wall
which
surrounded
the
dean
garden
creeping
on
by
that
till
it
ended
he
made
an
unsteady
dash
across
the
road
for
the
wall
of
the
cathedral
and
then
from
that
across
again
zigzag
to
his
own
little
gate
where
gathering
his
strength
for
the
last
effort
he
took
the
boy
whom
he
apostrophised
as
a
perfect
old
man
of
the
sea
in
both
arms
as
a
mother
does
her
child
and
a
moment
afterward
laid
him
on
the
floor
of
the
long
low
room
where
they
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
together
and
from
whence
he
had
gone
out
a
short
time
before
all
life
and
strength
and
youth
and
beauty
gone
to
his
death
the
tenor
felt
the
phrase
in
his
mind
but
stifled
it
with
a
thank
god
as
he
laid
him
down
he
had
been
fatigued
by
the
long
row
when
the
accident
happened
and
was
now
almost
exhausted
by
excitement
terror
for
the
boy
and
this
last
effort
but
still
his
mind
went
on
with
abnormal
clearness
noting
every
trifle
and
continuing
to
force
him
as
it
were
to
render
an
account
of
each
to
himself
he
noticed
the
perfume
of
roses
the
roses
the
boy
had
showered
in
upon
him
so
short
a
time
before
and
he
found
himself
measuring
the
shortness
of
the
interval
again
as
if
it
would
have
been
easier
to
bear
the
catastrophe
had
it
not
jostled
a
happier
state
of
things
so
closely
he
found
himself
wondering
what
the
boy
would
say
if
he
knew
he
had
brought
him
in
by
the
front
door
instead
of
by
the
window
he
was
sure
he
would
have
insisted
on
the
mode
of
entrance
he
so
much
preferred
had
he
been
conscious
and
felt
as
if
he
had
taken
a
disloyal
advantage
of
the
boy
helpless
condition
but
while
these
trivial
thoughts
flashed
through
his
brain
he
lost
no
time
not
even
in
lighting
a
lamp
though
the
room
was
dark
what
there
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
promptly
and
with
the
same
extraordinary
lucidity
of
mind
he
remembered
every
simple
remedy
there
was
at
his
disposal
he
ran
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
for
the
blankets
off
his
own
bed
he
had
made
up
the
kitchen
fire
as
was
his
wont
that
evening
for
the
boy
to
cook
if
it
pleased
him
and
fortunately
it
was
burning
brightly
still
he
warmed
the
blankets
there
and
then
returning
stripped
the
light
flannel
clothing
from
the
boy
loosened
his
fingers
from
the
violin
which
he
still
clutched
convulsively
rolled
him
up
in
them
and
then
with
an
effort
lifted
him
on
to
the
sofa
where
he
had
sat
and
jested
only
a
little
while
ago
and
again
the
involuntary
reckoning
of
time
to
consider
the
contrast
between
the
then
and
now
smote
the
tenor
to
the
heart
with
a
cruel
pang
boy
dear
boy
he
called
to
him
he
was
kneeling
beside
him
but
could
only
see
a
dim
outline
of
his
face
in
the
obscurity
of
the
room
and
perhaps
it
was
the
darkness
that
made
him
look
so
rigid
boy
dear
boy
he
cried
again
but
the
boy
made
no
sign
o
god
spare
him
the
stricken
man
implored
and
then
he
clasped
the
lad
in
his
arms
and
pressed
his
cheek
to
his
in
a
burst
of
grief
and
tenderness
not
to
be
controlled
he
held
him
so
for
a
few
seconds
and
it
seemed
as
if
in
that
close
embrace
his
whole
being
had
expressed
itself
in
love
and
prayer
as
if
he
had
wrestled
with
death
itself
and
conquered
for
all
at
once
he
felt
the
boy
limbs
quiver
through
their
clumsy
wrappings
and
then
he
heard
him
sigh
oh
the
relief
of
it
the
sudden
reaction
made
him
feel
sick
and
faint
but
the
precious
life
was
not
yet
safe
there
many
a
slip
so
his
mind
began
in
spite
of
an
effort
to
control
it
restoratives
heat
stimulants
friction
he
pulled
the
stand
of
ferns
and
flowering
plants
half
round
from
the
fireplace
roughly
so
that
the
pots
fell
up
against
each
other
or
rolled
on
the
floor
then
he
fetched
the
burning
coals
from
the
kitchen
and
heaped
them
on
till
the
grate
was
full
the
kettle
had
been
boiling
on
the
hob
so
he
brought
it
in
now
hissing
with
brandy
to
make
a
drink
but
he
must
have
more
light
where
are
the
matches
nowhere
of
course
they
never
are
when
they
wanted
however
it
did
matter
a
piece
of
paper
would
do
as
well
and
he
twisted
a
piece
up
and
stooped
among
the
scattered
roses
to
light
it
at
the
fire
and
then
he
lit
the
lamp
and
turned
to
look
at
the
boy
all
this
had
been
done
in
a
moment
as
it
seemed
and
his
face
was
still
bright
with
hope
and
prepared
to
smile
encouragement
but
god
in
heaven
he
cried
under
his
breath
as
a
man
does
who
is
too
shocked
to
speak
out
had
some
strange
metamorphosis
been
brought
about
by
that
sudden
immersion
he
pulled
himself
together
with
an
effort
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
sofa
and
his
hands
upraised
to
his
head
trying
to
steady
himself
then
he
returned
no
he
had
not
been
mistaken
he
was
not
mad
he
was
not
dreaming
it
was
the
boy
who
had
plunged
into
the
water
headforemost
but
this
god
in
heaven
he
ejaculated
again
under
his
breath
and
then
stood
gazing
like
one
transfixed
for
this
with
the
handsome
strong
young
face
upturned
the
smooth
white
throat
the
dark
brown
braids
pinned
close
to
the
head
all
wet
and
shining
this
was
not
the
boy
but
the
tenor
own
lady
his
ideal
of
purity
his
goddess
of
truth
his
angel
of
pity
as
in
his
foolishly
fond
way
idealizing
he
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
her
it
was
angelica
herself
yet
so
complete
had
been
the
deception
to
his
simple
unsuspicious
mind
so
impossible
to
believe
was
the
revelation
and
so
used
was
he
to
associate
some
idea
of
the
boy
with
everything
that
occurred
that
now
with
his
first
conscious
mental
effort
he
began
to
blame
him
as
if
her
being
there
were
due
to
some
unpardonable
piece
of
his
mischief
the
little
wretch
he
began
how
dare
he
he
stopped
there
realizing
the
absurdity
of
it
realizing
that
there
was
no
boy
and
no
lady
for
the
matter
of
that
at
least
none
such
as
he
had
imagined
it
had
all
been
a
cruel
fraud
from
beginning
to
end
it
was
a
terrible
blow
but
the
dignity
of
the
man
was
never
more
apparent
than
in
the
way
he
bore
it
his
face
was
unnaturally
pale
and
set
but
there
was
no
other
sign
of
what
he
suffered
and
the
first
shock
over
he
at
once
resumed
his
anxious
efforts
to
restore
the
girl
whose
consciousness
had
scarcely
yet
returned
although
she
breathed
and
had
moved
it
was
curious
how
the
new
knowledge
already
affected
his
attitude
toward
her
in
preparing
the
hot
drink
he
put
half
the
quantity
of
brandy
he
would
have
used
five
minutes
before
for
the
boy
and
when
he
had
to
raise
her
head
to
make
her
swallow
it
he
did
so
reluctantly
it
was
only
a
change
of
idea
really
the
boy
was
a
girl
that
was
all
but
what
a
difference
it
made
and
would
have
made
even
if
there
had
been
no
question
of
love
and
marriage
in
the
matter
at
any
other
time
the
tenor
himself
might
have
marvelled
at
the
place
apart
we
assign
in
our
estimation
to
one
of
two
people
of
like
powers
passions
impulses
and
purposes
simply
because
one
of
them
is
a
woman
the
stimulant
revived
the
girl
and
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
met
his
as
he
bent
over
her
you
are
better
now
i
hope
he
said
coldly
moving
away
from
her
i
am
better
she
answered
and
again
their
eyes
met
but
there
was
yet
another
moment
of
dazed
before
she
was
able
to
attach
any
meaning
to
the
change
she
saw
in
his
face
and
then
it
flashed
upon
her
what
she
had
hoped
feared
expected
and
prevented
every
time
they
met
had
come
to
pass
he
knew
at
last
and
she
could
see
at
once
what
he
thought
of
her
she
would
never
again
meet
the
tolerant
loving
glance
he
had
had
for
the
boy
nor
note
the
tender
reverence
of
his
face
when
her
own
name
was
mentioned
his
idol
was
shattered
the
dream
and
hope
of
his
life
was
over
and
from
all
that
remained
of
them
herself
as
she
really
was
he
shrank
as
from
the
dishonoured
fragment
of
some
once
loved
and
holy
thing
a
thing
which
is
doubly
painful
to
contemplate
in
its
ruin
because
of
the
importunate
memories
that
cling
about
it
realizing
something
of
this
she
uttered
a
smothered
ejaculation
and
covered
her
face
with
a
gesture
of
intolerable
shame
there
was
always
that
saving
grace
of
womanliness
about
angelica
that
when
there
was
no
excuse
for
her
conduct
she
had
the
honesty
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
in
consequence
of
which
she
was
one
of
those
who
never
erred
in
the
same
way
twice
the
tenor
turned
to
the
fire
and
then
noticing
her
wet
things
scattered
about
he
gathered
them
up
i
will
take
them
and
dry
them
he
said
and
gladly
made
his
escape
what
he
thought
in
the
interval
was
i
must
marry
her
now
i
suppose
and
he
could
not
help
smiling
ironically
at
this
new
way
of
putting
it
nor
wondering
a
little
at
the
possibility
of
such
a
sudden
change
of
feeling
as
that
which
had
all
at
once
transformed
the
dearest
wish
of
his
life
into
a
distasteful
if
not
altogether
repugnant
duty
when
the
things
were
dry
he
took
them
to
her
i
will
leave
you
to
put
them
on
he
said
will
you
kindly
call
me
when
you
are
ready
and
then
he
closed
the
window
that
looked
out
on
the
road
drew
down
the
blind
and
once
more
left
her
no
reproach
could
have
chilled
and
frightened
her
as
this
stiff
and
formal
yet
cool
acceptance
of
the
position
did
she
feared
it
meant
that
all
was
over
between
them
in
a
way
she
had
never
thought
possible
but
still
she
hoped
to
coax
him
round
she
dreaded
the
next
hour
the
day
of
reckoning
as
it
were
but
did
not
try
to
escape
it
on
the
contrary
she
hastened
her
dressing
in
order
to
get
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
israfil
she
called
to
him
boldly
as
soon
as
she
was
ready
the
tenor
returned
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
when
he
entered
and
she
looked
at
him
confidently
and
just
as
the
boy
would
have
done
after
a
piece
of
mischief
which
he
had
determined
to
brazen
out
the
boy
had
two
moods
the
defiant
and
the
repentant
it
seemed
that
the
girl
but
here
the
tenor
checked
his
thoughts
it
was
very
hard
though
to
drop
either
of
the
two
individualities
which
had
hitherto
been
so
distinct
and
different
and
to
realize
that
one
of
them
at
least
had
never
existed
she
certainly
brought
more
courage
to
the
interview
than
he
did
for
he
the
wronged
one
found
as
he
faced
her
now
that
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
himself
for
the
moment
she
was
master
of
the
situation
and
she
began
at
once
as
if
the
whole
thing
were
a
matter
of
course
catching
an
involuntary
glance
of
the
tenor
she
put
both
hands
up
to
her
head
as
the
boy
would
have
done
so
the
tenor
still
confused
between
the
two
expressed
it
to
himself
and
the
old
familiar
gesture
sent
another
pang
through
his
heart
the
water
had
washed
the
flaxen
wig
away
but
the
thick
braids
of
her
hair
were
still
pinned
up
tightly
accounting
for
the
shape
of
the
about
which
the
boy
had
so
often
and
as
was
now
evident
so
recklessly
jested
her
hair
was
very
wet
and
she
began
deliberately
to
take
it
down
and
unplait
it
i
could
not
always
make
it
my
head
you
know
the
same
shape
she
said
answering
his
thought
but
you
never
noticed
the
difference
although
you
often
looked
i
used
to
wonder
how
you
could
look
so
intelligently
and
see
so
little
and
she
glanced
down
at
herself
so
unmistakably
a
woman
now
that
he
knew
she
had
been
like
a
conundrum
the
answer
to
which
you
would
never
have
guessed
for
yourself
but
you
see
it
at
once
when
you
hear
it
and
then
it
seems
so
simple
she
was
rather
inclined
to
speak
to
the
tenor
in
a
half
pitying
patronizing
way
as
to
a
weak
creature
easily
taken
in
but
he
had
recovered
himself
by
this
time
and
something
in
his
look
and
manner
awed
her
determined
as
she
was
and
she
could
not
keep
it
up
he
moved
farther
from
her
and
then
spoke
in
a
voice
made
harsh
by
the
effort
it
cost
him
to
control
it
why
have
you
done
this
thing
he
said
sternly
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
the
colour
left
her
lips
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
covered
once
more
with
shame
and
confusion
but
boy
or
girl
the
charm
of
her
peculiar
personality
was
still
the
same
and
it
had
its
effect
upon
him
even
at
that
moment
indignant
as
he
was
as
she
sat
there
her
long
hair
falling
behind
her
looking
up
at
him
with
timid
eyes
and
with
tremulous
mouth
it
was
pitiful
to
see
her
so
and
it
softened
him
what
was
your
object
he
asked
relenting
excitement
restlessness
if
i
had
any
she
faltered
but
i
had
no
object
i
am
inventing
one
now
because
you
ask
me
it
is
an
afterthought
i
i
took
the
first
step
with
a
dry
sob
and
then
i
i
just
drifted
on
on
you
know
from
one
thing
to
another
but
tell
me
all
about
it
he
persisted
taking
a
seat
as
he
spoke
tell
me
exactly
how
it
began
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
he
was
sitting
in
judgment
upon
her
and
she
felt
that
she
must
make
an
effort
to
satisfy
him
it
began
oh
let
me
see
how
am
i
to
tell
you
and
she
twisted
her
hands
frowning
in
perplexity
i
do
want
to
embellish
the
story
so
as
to
make
it
picturesque
and
myself
more
interesting
and
she
looked
at
the
tenor
with
slightly
elevated
eyebrows
as
if
pained
already
by
her
own
inaccuracy
there
was
something
irresistibly
comic
in
this
candid
avowal
of
the
force
of
habit
and
all
the
more
so
because
she
was
too
much
in
earnest
for
once
to
see
the
humour
of
it
herself
the
tenor
saw
it
however
but
he
made
no
sign
well
begin
he
said
i
ought
to
know
your
method
sufficiently
well
by
this
time
to
enable
me
to
sift
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
angelica
considered
a
little
and
then
she
answered
hesitating
as
if
she
were
choosing
each
word
i
see
where
the
mistake
has
been
all
along
there
was
no
latitude
allowed
for
my
individuality
i
was
a
girl
and
therefore
i
was
not
supposed
to
have
any
bent
i
found
a
big
groove
ready
waiting
for
me
when
i
grew
up
and
in
that
i
was
expected
to
live
whether
it
suited
me
or
not
it
did
not
suit
me
it
was
deep
and
narrow
and
gave
me
no
room
to
move
you
see
i
loved
to
make
music
art
that
was
it
there
is
in
my
own
mind
an
imperative
monitor
which
urges
me
on
always
into
competition
with
other
minds
i
wanted
to
as
well
as
to
and
i
knew
i
wanted
to
do
but
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
begin
my
friends
armed
themselves
with
the
whole
social
system
as
it
obtains
in
our
state
of
life
and
came
out
to
oppose
me
they
used
to
lecture
me
and
give
me
good
advice
as
if
they
were
able
to
judge
and
it
made
me
rage
i
had
none
of
the
domestic
virtues
and
yet
they
would
insist
upon
domesticating
me
and
the
funny
part
of
it
was
that
side
by
side
with
my
natural
aspirations
was
an
innate
tendency
to
conform
to
their
ideas
while
carrying
out
my
own
i
believe
i
could
have
satisfied
them
my
friends
if
only
they
had
not
thwarted
me
but
that
was
the
mistake
i
had
the
ability
to
be
something
more
than
a
young
lady
fiddling
away
her
time
on
useless
trifles
but
i
was
not
allowed
to
apply
it
systematically
and
ability
is
like
steam
a
great
power
when
properly
applied
a
great
danger
otherwise
let
it
escape
recklessly
and
the
chances
are
someone
will
be
scalded
bottle
it
up
and
there
will
be
an
explosion
in
my
case
both
happened
the
steam
was
allowed
to
escape
at
first
instead
of
being
applied
to
help
me
on
in
a
definite
career
and
a
good
deal
of
scalding
ensued
and
then
to
remedy
that
mistake
the
dangerous
experiment
of
bottling
it
up
was
tried
and
only
too
successfully
i
helped
a
little
in
the
bottling
myself
i
suppose
and
then
came
the
explosion
this
is
the
explosion
glancing
round
the
disordered
room
and
then
looking
down
at
her
masculine
attire
i
see
it
all
now
she
proceeded
in
a
spiritless
way
looking
fixedly
into
the
fire
as
if
she
were
trying
to
describe
something
she
saw
there
i
had
the
feeling
never
actually
formulated
in
words
but
quite
easy
to
interpret
now
that
if
i
broke
down
conventional
obstacles
broke
the
hampering
laws
of
society
i
should
have
a
chance
it
is
a
common
mistake
the
tenor
observed
filling
up
the
pause
but
i
did
not
know
how
she
pursued
or
where
to
begin
or
what
particular
law
to
break
until
one
evening
i
was
sitting
alone
at
an
open
window
in
the
dark
and
i
was
tired
of
doing
nothing
and
very
sorry
for
myself
and
i
wanted
an
object
in
life
more
than
ever
and
then
a
great
longing
seized
me
i
thought
it
an
aspiration
i
wanted
to
go
out
there
and
then
i
wanted
to
be
free
to
go
and
come
as
i
would
i
felt
a
galling
sense
of
restraint
all
at
once
and
i
determined
to
break
the
law
that
imposed
it
and
that
alone
was
a
satisfaction
the
finding
of
one
law
that
i
could
break
i
did
suppose
i
could
learn
much
there
was
much
left
to
learn
this
was
said
bitterly
as
if
she
attached
the
blame
of
it
to
somebody
else
but
i
should
be
amused
and
that
was
something
and
i
should
see
the
world
as
men
see
it
which
would
be
from
a
new
point
of
view
for
me
and
that
would
be
interesting
it
is
curious
is
it
she
reflected
that
what
men
call
they
always
go
out
at
night
to
see
and
what
they
mean
by
is
generally
something
disgraceful
it
was
to
the
fire
that
she
made
this
observation
and
then
she
resumed
it
is
astonishing
how
importunate
some
ideas
become
one
now
and
then
of
all
the
numbers
that
occur
to
you
how
it
takes
possession
of
you
and
how
it
insists
upon
being
carried
into
effect
this
one
gave
me
no
peace
i
knew
from
the
first
i
should
do
it
although
i
did
want
to
and
i
intend
to
if
you
can
understand
such
a
thing
but
my
dress
was
an
obstacle
as
a
woman
i
could
not
expect
to
be
treated
by
men
with
as
much
respect
as
they
show
to
each
other
i
know
the
value
of
men
cant
about
protecting
the
sex
because
i
was
a
woman
i
knew
i
should
be
insulted
or
at
all
events
hindered
however
inoffensive
my
conduct
and
so
i
prepared
this
disguise
and
i
began
to
be
amused
at
once
it
amused
me
to
devise
it
i
saw
a
tailor
advertisement
with
instructions
how
to
measure
yourself
and
i
measured
myself
and
sent
to
london
for
the
clothes
these
thin
ones
are
padded
to
make
me
look
square
like
a
boy
and
then
with
some
difficulty
i
got
a
wig
of
the
right
colour
it
fitted
exactly
covered
all
my
own
hair
you
know
and
was
so
beautifully
made
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
unsuspicious
person
to
detect
it
without
touching
it
and
the
light
shade
of
it
too
accounted
for
the
fairness
of
my
skin
which
would
have
looked
suspiciously
clear
and
delicate
with
darker
hair
the
great
difficulty
was
my
hands
and
feet
but
the
different
shape
of
a
boy
shoes
made
my
feet
pass
and
i
crumpled
my
hands
up
and
kept
them
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
but
they
are
not
of
a
degenerated
smallness
she
added
looking
at
them
critically
it
is
more
their
shape
however
when
i
dressed
myself
and
put
on
that
long
ulster
i
saw
the
disguise
would
pass
and
felt
pretty
safe
but
is
it
surprising
the
difference
dress
makes
i
should
hardly
have
thought
it
possible
to
convert
a
substantial
young
woman
into
such
a
slender
boy
as
i
make
but
it
just
shows
how
important
dress
is
the
tenor
groaned
did
you
know
the
risk
you
were
running
he
asked
oh
yes
she
answered
coolly
i
knew
i
was
breaking
a
law
of
the
land
i
knew
i
should
be
taken
before
a
police
magistrate
if
i
were
caught
masquerading
and
that
added
excitement
to
the
pleasure
the
charm
of
danger
but
then
you
see
it
was
danger
without
danger
for
me
because
i
knew
i
should
be
mistaken
for
my
brother
our
own
parents
do
not
know
us
apart
when
we
are
dressed
alike
oh
then
there
two
of
you
the
tenor
said
yes
i
told
you
they
call
us
the
heavenly
twins
said
angelica
yes
you
told
me
the
tenor
repeated
thoughtfully
but
then
you
told
me
so
many
things
well
i
told
you
nothing
that
was
not
absolutely
true
angelica
answered
from
diavolo
point
of
view
i
assumed
his
manner
and
habits
when
i
put
these
things
on
imitated
him
in
everything
tried
to
think
his
thoughts
and
looked
at
myself
from
his
point
of
view
in
fact
my
difficulty
was
to
remember
that
i
was
not
him
i
used
to
forget
sometimes
and
think
i
was
but
i
confess
that
i
never
was
such
a
gentleman
as
diavolo
is
always
under
all
circumstances
poor
dear
diavolo
she
added
regretfully
how
he
would
have
enjoyed
those
fried
potatoes
the
tenor
slightly
changed
his
position
he
only
glanced
at
her
now
and
then
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
for
the
rest
he
sat
as
she
did
with
his
calm
deep
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
and
an
expression
of
patient
sadness
upon
his
face
that
wrung
her
heart
perhaps
it
was
to
stifle
the
pain
of
it
that
she
began
to
talk
garrulously
oh
i
am
sorry
for
the
trick
i
have
played
you
she
exclaimed
with
real
feeling
i
have
been
sorry
all
along
since
i
knew
your
worth
and
i
came
to
tell
you
to
confess
and
to
apologize
when
i
first
knew
you
all
my
was
dormant
if
you
know
what
that
is
i
mean
the
love
in
us
for
our
which
makes
it
pain
to
ourselves
to
injure
them
but
you
that
feeling
and
strengthened
and
added
to
it
until
it
had
become
predominant
so
that
since
i
have
known
you
as
you
are
i
have
hated
to
deceive
you
this
is
the
first
uncomfortable
feeling
of
that
kind
i
have
ever
had
but
for
the
rest
i
did
not
care
i
was
bored
i
was
always
bored
and
i
resented
the
serene
unconcern
of
my
friends
their
indifference
to
my
aspirations
and
the
way
they
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
everything
i
ought
to
want
and
could
therefore
be
happy
if
i
chose
exasperated
me
to
be
bored
seems
a
slight
thing
but
a
world
of
suffering
is
contained
in
the
experience
and
do
you
know
israfil
i
think
it
dangerous
to
leave
an
energetic
woman
without
a
single
strong
interest
or
object
in
life
trouble
is
sure
to
come
of
it
sooner
or
later
which
sounds
like
a
truism
now
that
i
have
said
it
and
truisms
are
things
which
we
habitually
neglect
to
act
upon
in
my
case
nothing
of
this
kind
would
have
happened
and
again
her
glance
round
the
room
expressed
a
comprehensive
view
of
her
present
situation
if
i
had
been
allowed
to
support
a
charity
hospital
with
my
violin
or
something
made
to
feel
responsible
you
know
but
surely
you
must
recognize
the
grave
responsibility
which
attaches
to
all
women
in
the
abstract
angelica
interposed
i
know
if
things
go
wrong
they
are
blamed
for
it
if
they
go
right
the
church
takes
the
credit
the
value
attached
to
the
influence
of
women
is
purely
fictitious
as
individuals
usually
find
when
they
come
to
demand
a
recognition
of
their
personal
power
i
should
have
been
held
to
have
done
my
duty
if
i
had
spent
the
rest
of
my
life
in
dressing
well
and
saying
the
proper
thing
no
one
would
consider
the
waste
of
power
which
is
involved
in
such
an
existence
you
often
hear
it
said
of
a
girl
that
she
should
have
been
a
boy
which
being
interpreted
means
that
she
has
superior
abilities
but
because
she
is
a
woman
it
is
not
thought
necessary
to
give
her
a
chance
of
making
a
career
for
herself
i
hope
to
live
however
to
see
it
allowed
that
a
woman
has
no
more
right
to
bury
her
talents
than
a
man
has
in
which
days
the
man
without
brains
will
be
taught
to
cook
and
clean
while
the
clever
woman
will
be
doing
the
work
of
the
world
well
which
is
now
being
so
shamefully
scamped
but
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
am
sure
all
my
vagaries
have
arisen
out
of
the
dread
of
having
nothing
better
to
do
from
now
until
the
day
of
my
death
as
i
once
said
to
an
uncle
of
mine
but
to
get
up
and
go
to
bed
after
spending
the
interval
in
the
elegant
and
useless
way
ladies
do
a
ride
a
drive
a
dinner
a
dance
a
little
music
trifling
all
the
time
to
no
purpose
not
even
amusing
one
self
for
when
amusement
begins
to
be
a
business
it
ceases
to
be
a
pleasure
this
has
not
mended
matters
i
know
she
acknowledged
drearily
but
it
has
been
a
distraction
and
that
was
something
while
it
lasted
monotony
however
luxurious
is
not
less
irksome
because
it
is
easy
a
hardworking
woman
would
have
rest
to
look
forward
to
but
i
had
even
that
although
i
was
always
wearied
to
death
as
tired
of
my
idleness
or
purposeless
occupations
as
anybody
could
possibly
be
by
work
i
think
if
you
will
put
yourself
in
my
place
you
will
not
wonder
at
me
nor
at
any
woman
under
the
circumstances
who
secure
of
herself
and
her
position
varies
the
monotony
of
her
life
with
an
occasional
escapade
as
one
puts
sauce
into
soup
to
relieve
the
insipidity
deplore
it
if
you
will
but
do
wonder
at
it
it
is
the
natural
consequence
of
an
unnatural
state
of
things
and
there
will
be
more
of
it
still
or
i
am
much
mistaken
again
the
tenor
changed
his
position
i
can
not
comprehend
how
you
could
have
risked
your
reputation
in
such
a
way
he
said
shaking
his
head
with
grave
concern
no
risk
to
my
reputation
she
answered
with
the
insolence
of
rank
everybody
knows
who
i
am
and
if
i
remember
rightly
in
the
captain
but
a
choleric
word
which
in
the
soldier
is
rank
blasphemy
what
would
be
an
unpardonable
offence
if
committed
by
another
woman
less
highly
placed
than
myself
is
merely
an
amusing
eccentricity
in
me
so
for
benefit
conveniently
snobbish
is
society
since
i
grew
up
however
i
find
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
can
say
flippantly
ca
have
everything
and
if
people
have
talents
they
are
not
to
be
expected
to
have
characters
as
well
great
talent
should
be
held
to
be
a
guarantee
for
good
character
the
loss
of
the
one
makes
the
possession
of
the
other
dangerous
but
what
i
do
maintain
is
that
i
have
done
nothing
by
which
i
ought
in
justice
to
be
held
to
have
jeopardised
my
character
i
have
broken
no
commandment
nor
should
i
under
any
circumstances
it
is
only
the
idea
of
the
thing
that
shocks
your
prejudices
you
can
not
bear
to
see
me
decently
dressed
as
a
boy
but
you
would
think
nothing
of
it
if
you
saw
me
half
undressed
for
a
ball
as
i
often
am
yet
if
the
one
can
be
done
with
a
modest
mind
and
you
must
know
that
it
can
so
can
the
other
i
suppose
the
tenor
was
sitting
sideways
on
his
chair
his
elbow
resting
on
the
back
his
head
on
his
hand
his
legs
crossed
half
turned
from
her
and
listening
without
looking
at
her
and
there
was
something
in
the
way
she
made
this
last
remark
that
set
a
familiar
chord
vibrating
not
unpleasantly
perhaps
after
the
revelation
he
had
expected
her
to
turn
into
a
totally
different
person
at
all
events
he
was
somewhat
surprised
but
not
disagreeably
to
perceive
how
like
the
boy
she
was
this
was
the
boy
again
exactly
in
a
bad
mood
and
the
tenor
sought
at
once
as
was
his
wont
to
distract
him
rather
than
argue
him
out
of
it
this
was
the
force
of
habit
and
it
was
also
due
to
the
fact
that
his
mind
was
rapidly
adapting
itself
to
a
strange
position
and
becoming
easier
in
the
new
attitude
the
woman
he
had
been
idolizing
was
lost
irretrievably
but
the
charm
which
had
been
the
boy
remained
to
him
and
he
had
already
begun
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
of
a
girl
who
must
be
helped
and
worked
for
instead
of
a
boy
but
why
should
you
have
chosen
this
impossible
form
of
amusement
in
particular
he
said
why
could
you
not
interest
yourself
in
the
people
about
you
do
something
for
them
i
did
think
of
that
i
did
try
she
answered
petulantly
but
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
to
devote
herself
to
people
for
whom
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
who
do
want
her
devotion
and
besides
devotion
was
my
vocation
but
after
all
she
broke
off
defending
herself
i
only
arrived
at
this
by
slow
degrees
and
i
never
should
have
come
so
far
at
all
if
diavolo
had
stuck
to
me
but
he
got
into
a
state
of
and
separated
his
work
from
mine
by
going
to
sandhurst
then
i
found
myself
alone
and
you
can
not
think
how
a
woman
must
suffer
from
the
awful
loneliness
of
a
life
like
mine
when
i
had
no
one
near
me
in
the
sense
in
which
diavolo
has
always
been
near
a
life
that
is
full
of
acquaintances
as
a
cake
is
full
of
currants
no
two
of
which
ever
touch
each
other
the
tenor
habitual
quiescence
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
he
changed
his
position
incessantly
and
did
so
now
again
it
was
the
only
sign
he
made
of
being
disturbed
at
all
and
as
he
moved
he
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
but
did
not
speak
i
kept
my
disguise
a
long
time
before
i
used
it
she
began
again
another
morsel
of
incident
and
motive
recurring
to
her
i
do
think
i
had
any
very
distinct
notion
of
what
i
should
do
with
it
when
i
got
it
the
pleasure
of
getting
it
had
been
everything
for
the
moment
and
having
succeeded
in
that
and
tried
the
dress
i
hid
it
away
carefully
and
scarcely
ever
thought
of
it
never
dreamt
of
wearing
it
certainly
until
one
night
it
was
quite
an
impulse
at
last
that
night
you
know
the
first
time
we
met
it
was
such
a
beautiful
night
i
was
by
myself
and
had
nothing
to
do
as
usual
and
it
tempted
me
sorely
i
thought
i
should
like
to
see
the
by
moonlight
and
then
all
at
once
i
thought
i
see
it
by
moonlight
that
was
my
first
weighty
reason
for
changing
my
dress
but
having
once
assumed
the
character
i
began
to
love
it
it
came
naturally
and
the
freedom
from
restraint
i
mean
the
restraint
of
our
tight
uncomfortable
clothing
was
delicious
i
tell
you
i
was
a
genuine
boy
i
moved
like
a
boy
i
felt
like
a
boy
i
was
my
own
brother
in
very
truth
mentally
and
morally
i
was
exactly
what
you
thought
me
and
there
was
little
fear
of
your
finding
me
out
although
i
used
to
like
to
play
with
the
position
and
run
the
risk
it
was
marvellous
the
tenor
said
not
at
all
she
answered
not
a
bit
more
marvellous
in
real
life
than
it
would
have
been
upon
the
stage
a
mere
exercise
of
the
actor
faculty
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
and
not
a
bit
more
marvellous
than
to
create
a
character
as
an
author
does
in
a
book
the
process
is
analogous
but
the
same
thing
has
been
done
before
george
sand
for
instance
do
you
remember
how
often
she
went
about
dressed
as
a
man
went
to
the
theatres
and
was
introduced
to
people
and
was
never
found
out
by
strangers
and
there
was
that
woman
who
was
a
doctor
in
the
army
for
so
long
until
she
was
quite
old
james
barry
she
called
herself
and
none
of
her
brother
officers
not
even
her
own
particular
chum
in
the
regiment
she
first
belonged
to
had
any
suspicion
of
her
sex
and
it
was
not
discovered
until
after
her
death
when
she
had
been
an
inspector
general
of
the
army
medical
department
for
many
years
and
there
have
been
women
in
the
ranks
too
and
at
sea
it
was
really
not
extraordinary
that
an
unobservant
and
unsuspicious
creature
like
yourself
should
have
been
deceived
this
recalled
the
patronizing
manner
of
the
boy
at
times
and
the
tenor
smiled
the
meeting
with
you
was
an
accident
of
course
angelica
proceeded
with
her
disjointed
narrative
but
i
thought
i
would
turn
it
to
account
i
was
as
you
used
to
say
devoured
by
curiosity
and
my
mind
is
always
tentative
i
wanted
to
hear
how
men
talk
to
each
other
i
did
believe
in
goodness
in
a
man
and
i
wanted
to
see
badness
from
the
man
point
of
view
i
expected
to
find
you
corrupt
in
some
particular
to
see
your
hoofs
and
your
horns
sooner
or
later
and
i
tried
to
make
you
show
them
but
that
of
course
you
never
did
and
i
soon
realized
my
mistake
i
had
a
standing
quarrel
with
your
sex
however
and
at
first
it
pleased
me
to
deceive
you
simply
because
you
were
a
man
that
was
only
at
the
very
first
for
as
soon
as
i
began
to
appreciate
your
worth
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
do
you
see
israfil
you
have
been
raising
me
all
along
it
has
been
a
very
gradual
process
though
but
still
i
wish
to
undeceive
you
i
would
have
done
so
at
once
if
you
had
not
been
so
far
above
me
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
when
i
gave
you
that
chance
in
the
cathedral
after
the
service
do
you
remember
it
would
have
been
stepping
down
from
your
pedestal
we
should
have
been
on
the
same
level
then
and
i
need
not
have
dreaded
your
righteous
indignation
but
as
it
was
you
maintained
your
high
position
and
i
was
afraid
and
i
could
not
give
you
up
it
was
delightful
to
look
at
myself
an
ideal
self
from
afar
off
with
your
eyes
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
could
be
all
you
thought
me
it
made
me
wish
to
be
so
and
it
also
made
me
more
sorry
than
anything
to
have
you
think
so
highly
of
me
when
i
did
not
deserve
it
all
these
were
signs
of
awakening
which
i
recognized
myself
and
i
did
try
over
and
over
again
to
undeceive
you
about
my
character
but
you
never
would
listen
to
me
i
wish
i
wish
you
had
do
you
love
me
then
the
tenor
asked
her
and
was
startled
himself
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
by
the
immediate
effect
of
the
question
upon
her
it
was
evident
that
she
had
received
a
terrible
shock
she
changed
colour
and
countenance
and
swayed
for
a
moment
as
if
she
were
about
to
faint
and
he
sprang
up
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
but
she
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
check
the
impulse
no
no
she
exclaimed
hoarsely
stop
stop
you
do
know
my
god
how
could
i
have
put
myself
in
such
a
position
i
mean
let
me
tell
you
she
shut
her
eyes
and
waited
the
tenor
looking
at
her
in
pained
surprise
he
sank
again
on
to
the
seat
from
which
he
had
risen
and
waited
also
wondering
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
the
charm
the
charm
she
faltered
has
all
been
in
the
delight
of
associating
with
a
man
intimately
who
did
not
know
i
was
a
woman
i
have
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
free
intercourse
with
your
masculine
mind
undiluted
by
your
masculine
prejudices
and
proclivities
with
regard
to
my
sex
had
you
known
that
i
was
a
woman
even
you
the
pleasure
of
your
companionship
would
have
been
spoilt
for
me
so
unwholesomely
is
the
imagination
of
a
man
affected
by
ideas
of
sex
the
fault
is
in
your
training
you
are
all
of
you
educated
deliberately
to
think
of
women
chiefly
as
the
opposite
sex
your
manner
to
me
has
been
quite
different
from
that
of
any
other
man
i
ever
knew
some
have
fawned
on
me
degrading
me
with
the
supposition
that
i
exist
for
the
benefit
of
man
alone
and
that
it
will
gratify
me
above
all
else
to
know
that
i
please
him
and
some
few
such
as
yourself
have
embarrassed
me
by
putting
me
on
a
pedestal
which
is
i
can
assure
you
an
exceedingly
cramped
and
uncomfortable
position
there
is
no
room
to
move
on
a
pedestal
now
with
you
alone
of
all
men
not
excepting
diavolo
i
almost
think
i
have
been
on
an
equal
footing
and
it
has
been
to
me
like
the
free
use
of
his
limbs
to
a
prisoner
after
long
confinement
with
chains
the
expression
which
the
tenor
abrupt
question
had
called
into
her
countenance
passed
off
as
she
spoke
and
with
it
the
impression
it
had
made
upon
the
tenor
he
mistook
the
remarks
she
had
just
been
making
for
a
natural
girlish
evasion
of
the
subject
and
he
did
not
return
to
it
partly
because
he
felt
it
to
be
an
inopportune
time
but
also
because
he
was
pretty
sure
of
her
feeling
for
him
and
thought
that
he
would
have
ample
leisure
by
and
by
the
leisure
of
a
lifetime
to
press
the
question
there
were
other
explanations
to
be
asked
for
too
which
it
seemed
advisable
to
him
to
get
over
at
once
and
have
done
with
but
how
have
you
managed
to
get
out
night
after
night
he
asked
without
being
missed
not
night
after
night
she
answered
if
you
remember
there
were
often
long
intervals
but
i
have
told
you
i
was
constantly
alone
the
house
is
large
none
of
the
servants
sleep
near
my
room
and
my
husband
your
the
tenor
demanded
turning
round
on
his
chair
to
face
her
every
vestige
of
colour
gone
from
his
countenance
yet
not
convinced
what
did
you
say
he
repeated
aghast
my
husband
she
faltered
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
hitherto
he
had
uttered
no
reproach
but
she
knew
that
this
reticence
was
due
to
rather
than
to
any
lingering
remnant
of
deference
and
now
when
she
saw
his
face
ablaze
she
was
prepared
for
an
outburst
of
wrath
all
he
said
however
was
speaking
with
quiet
dignity
you
need
not
have
allowed
that
part
of
the
deception
to
go
on
you
should
have
told
me
that
at
once
why
did
you
not
for
the
first
time
angelica
lost
her
presence
of
mind
i
i
forgot
she
stammered
the
tenor
threw
back
his
sunny
head
and
laughed
bitterly
it
is
a
curious
fact
angelica
remarked
upon
reflection
and
as
if
speaking
to
herself
but
i
really
had
forgotten
the
tenor
looked
at
the
fire
and
in
the
little
pause
that
ensued
angelica
suddenly
lost
her
temper
if
you
are
deceived
in
me
you
have
deceived
yourself
she
burst
out
for
i
have
tried
my
utmost
to
undeceive
you
you
go
and
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
you
have
never
spoken
to
in
your
life
you
endow
her
gratuitously
with
all
the
virtues
you
admire
without
asking
if
she
cares
to
possess
them
and
when
you
find
she
is
not
the
peerless
perfection
you
require
her
to
be
you
blame
her
oh
is
that
like
a
man
you
all
say
the
same
thing
was
me
what
will
your
husband
say
the
tenor
ejaculated
in
an
undertone
well
you
see
the
bargain
was
when
i
asked
him
to
marry
me
when
you
said
the
tenor
asked
him
to
marry
me
angelica
calmly
repeated
the
bargain
was
that
he
should
let
me
do
as
i
liked
there
being
a
tacit
understanding
between
us
of
course
that
i
should
do
nothing
morally
wrong
i
could
not
under
any
circumstances
do
anything
morally
wrong
not
i
confess
because
i
am
particularly
but
because
i
can
not
imagine
where
the
charm
and
pleasure
of
the
morally
wrong
comes
in
the
best
pleasures
in
life
are
in
art
not
in
animalism
and
all
the
benefit
of
your
acquaintance
i
repeat
has
consisted
in
the
fact
that
you
were
unaware
of
my
sex
i
knew
that
directly
you
became
aware
of
it
another
element
would
be
introduced
into
our
friendship
which
would
entirely
spoil
it
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
as
showing
how
hopelessly
involved
man
moral
perceptions
are
with
his
prejudices
and
faith
in
custom
even
when
reprehensible
that
the
tenor
was
if
anything
more
shocked
by
outspoken
objection
to
grossness
than
he
would
have
been
by
a
declaration
of
passion
on
her
part
the
latter
lapse
is
not
unprecedented
and
therefore
might
have
been
excused
as
natural
but
the
unusual
nature
of
the
declaration
she
had
made
put
it
into
the
category
to
which
all
things
out
of
order
are
relegated
to
be
taken
exception
to
irrespective
of
their
ethical
value
but
he
said
nothing
only
he
turned
from
her
once
more
and
gazed
sorrowfully
into
the
fire
angelica
looked
at
him
with
a
dissatisfied
frown
on
her
face
i
wish
you
would
speak
she
said
to
him
under
her
breath
and
then
she
began
again
herself
with
her
accustomed
volubility
oh
yes
i
married
that
was
what
was
expected
of
me
now
my
brother
when
he
grew
up
was
asked
with
the
most
earnest
solicitude
what
he
would
like
to
be
or
to
do
everything
was
made
easy
for
him
to
enter
upon
any
career
he
might
choose
but
nobody
thought
of
giving
me
a
chance
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
i
should
be
content
to
marry
and
only
to
marry
and
when
i
expressed
my
objection
to
being
so
limited
nobody
believed
i
was
in
earnest
so
here
i
am
and
i
wo
deny
she
confessed
with
her
habitual
candour
that
it
did
occur
to
me
that
i
might
have
cared
for
you
as
a
lover
had
i
not
been
married
but
of
course
the
thought
did
not
disturb
me
it
was
merely
a
passing
glimpse
of
a
when
one
has
a
husband
one
must
be
loyal
to
him
even
in
thought
whatever
terms
we
are
on
the
tenor
rose
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
stood
there
for
a
little
leaning
against
the
with
his
back
to
her
looking
out
at
the
cathedral
he
felt
sick
and
faint
and
found
the
fire
and
the
smell
of
the
roses
overpowering
but
presently
he
recovered
and
then
he
returned
to
her
his
face
was
set
now
white
and
passionless
as
it
had
been
while
he
waited
to
rescue
her
from
the
river
and
when
he
spoke
there
was
no
tone
in
his
voice
it
was
as
if
he
were
repeating
some
dry
fact
by
rote
there
is
no
excuse
for
you
then
he
said
and
she
perceived
with
surprise
that
until
he
knew
she
was
married
he
had
tried
to
believe
that
there
was
you
were
playing
with
me
cheating
me
mocking
me
all
the
time
angelica
looked
at
him
in
dismay
israfil
israfil
she
pleaded
springing
to
her
feet
and
clasping
his
arm
with
both
hands
her
better
nature
thoroughly
aroused
o
israfil
forgive
me
she
almost
shook
him
in
her
vehemence
then
flung
him
from
her
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
eyes
for
an
instant
mocking
you
oh
no
she
protested
believe
me
believe
me
if
you
can
i
respected
you
almost
from
the
first
i
reverenced
you
at
last
i
used
to
tease
you
about
myself
to
begin
with
i
repeat
because
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
you
could
care
seriously
for
a
girl
to
whom
you
had
never
spoken
then
i
began
to
perceive
my
mistake
then
i
felt
anxious
to
get
you
to
go
away
and
return
and
be
properly
introduced
to
us
and
so
you
schemed
i
arranged
a
future
for
you
that
is
worthy
of
you
o
israfil
i
have
some
conscience
i
am
not
so
bad
as
you
think
me
even
if
i
had
not
dared
to
tell
you
i
should
have
sent
you
a
full
explanation
as
soon
as
you
had
gone
i
thought
when
once
you
were
engaged
upon
a
new
career
you
would
forget
all
this
i
am
surprised
to
hear
that
you
did
not
expect
me
to
enjoy
the
joke
at
my
own
expense
the
trick
you
have
played
me
angelica
changed
countenance
it
was
exactly
what
she
had
expected
do
speak
bitterly
to
me
she
exclaimed
it
is
not
natural
for
you
to
do
so
oh
i
should
know
i
know
only
too
well
all
your
good
qualities
my
heart
has
been
wrung
a
hundred
times
by
the
thought
of
all
i
have
lost
by
my
folly
she
raised
her
hands
with
a
despairing
gesture
do
imagine
that
you
suffer
alone
or
more
than
i
do
there
is
hope
for
you
there
is
none
for
me
but
one
thing
has
been
a
comfort
i
knew
you
only
cared
for
an
ideal
creature
not
at
all
like
me
i
was
not
afraid
you
would
break
your
heart
for
a
phantom
that
had
never
existed
and
for
me
as
i
am
i
knew
you
could
have
no
regard
i
see
she
broke
off
i
see
all
the
contradictions
that
are
involved
in
what
i
have
said
and
am
saying
and
yet
i
mean
it
all
in
separate
sections
of
my
consciousness
each
separate
clause
exists
at
this
moment
however
contradictory
and
there
is
no
reconciling
them
but
there
they
are
i
ca
understand
it
myself
and
i
do
want
you
to
try
all
i
ask
you
is
to
believe
me
to
forgive
me
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
after
this
and
then
the
tenor
spoke
again
it
is
nearly
morning
he
said
i
will
see
you
safely
home
the
boy
had
been
allowed
to
come
and
go
as
he
liked
but
with
her
it
was
different
and
the
altered
position
made
itself
again
apparent
in
this
need
for
an
escort
it
was
evident
too
from
the
way
the
tenor
had
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
tacitly
agreeing
to
the
assertion
for
me
as
i
am
i
knew
you
could
have
no
regard
that
he
considered
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
but
angelica
retained
her
childish
habit
of
talking
everything
out
and
this
did
not
satisfy
her
it
was
such
a
lame
conclusion
she
got
up
now
however
to
accompany
him
my
hair
she
exclaimed
recollecting
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
hair
i
suppose
my
wig
is
lost
then
she
burst
out
passionately
oh
why
did
you
save
my
life
and
wrung
her
hands
or
why
are
you
different
now
you
know
ca
you
say
something
to
restore
my
wo
you
forgive
me
the
tenor
face
contracted
as
with
a
spasm
of
pain
he
had
much
to
forgive
and
he
may
be
pardoned
if
he
showed
no
eagerness
but
he
spoke
at
last
i
do
forgive
you
he
said
then
all
at
once
his
great
tender
heart
swelled
with
pity
poor
misguided
girl
he
faltered
with
a
broken
voice
may
god
in
heaven
forgive
you
and
help
you
and
keep
you
safe
and
make
you
good
and
true
and
pure
now
and
always
she
sank
down
at
that
and
clasped
his
feet
and
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
which
were
as
a
fervent
to
the
tenor
prayer
come
he
said
raising
her
come
before
it
is
too
late
you
must
do
something
with
your
hair
but
she
could
not
plait
it
her
hands
trembled
so
and
he
was
obliged
to
help
her
he
got
her
a
hat
to
roll
it
up
under
the
light
is
uncertain
he
said
and
it
is
raining
now
even
if
we
do
meet
anyone
i
do
think
they
would
notice
especially
if
i
can
find
an
umbrella
for
you
he
hunted
one
up
from
somewhere
and
then
he
hurried
her
away
ferried
her
across
the
river
and
left
her
at
the
lodge
gate
safely
his
last
words
being
you
will
do
some
good
in
the
world
you
will
be
a
good
woman
yet
i
know
i
know
you
will
end
of
book
iv
book
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
face
to
face
in
my
chamber
my
silent
chamber
i
saw
her
god
and
she
and
i
only
there
i
sat
down
to
draw
her
soul
through
the
clefts
of
confession
speak
i
am
holding
thee
fast
as
the
angel
of
recollection
shall
do
it
at
last
my
cup
is
with
my
sin
she
said
and
i
pour
it
out
to
the
bitter
lees
as
if
the
angel
of
judgment
stood
over
me
strong
at
last
or
as
thou
wert
as
these
barrett
howbeit
all
is
not
lost
the
warm
noon
ends
in
frost
and
worldly
tongues
of
promise
like
die
from
us
on
the
desert
hills
yet
through
the
silence
shall
pierce
the
call
and

thou

chapter
i
half
an
hour
after
the
tenor
parted
from
angelica
she
was
sleeping
soundly
not
because
she
was
dedolent
but
because
she
was
exhausted
and
when
that
is
the
case
sleep
is
the
blessed
privilege
of
youth
and
strength
let
what
will
have
preceded
it
she
lay
there
in
her
luxurious
bed
with
one
hand
under
her
head
her
thick
dark
hair
just
as
the
tenor
had
braided
it
in
contrast
to
the
broad
white
pillow
her
smooth
face
on
which
no
emotion
of
any
kind
had
written
a
line
as
yet
placid
as
a
little
child
to
all
appearance
an
ideal
of
innocence
and
beauty
and
while
she
slept
the
rain
stopped
the
misty
morning
broke
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
the
sun
shone
forth
welcomed
by
a
buzz
of
insects
and
chirrup
of
birds
the
uprising
of
countless
summer
scents
and
the
opening
of
rainbow
flowers
it
was
one
of
those
radiant
days
harmonizing
best
with
tranquil
or
joyous
moods
when
if
we
are
disconsolate
nature
seems
to
mock
our
misery
and
callous
earth
rejoices
forgetful
of
storms
making
us
wonder
with
a
deeper
discontent
why
we
too
can
not
forget
angelica
slept
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
and
when
she
did
awake
late
in
the
morning
it
was
not
gradually
with
that
pleasant
dreamy
languor
which
precedes
mental
activity
in
happy
times
but
with
a
sudden
start
that
aroused
her
to
full
consciousness
in
a
moment
and
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
occurred
the
night
before
black
circles
round
her
eyes
bore
witness
to
the
danger
fatigue
and
emotion
of
her
late
experiences
she
had
a
sharp
pain
in
her
head
too
and
she
was
unaccustomed
to
physical
pain
but
she
felt
it
less
than
the
dull
ache
she
had
at
her
heart
and
a
general
sense
of
things
gone
wrong
that
oppressed
her
but
which
she
strove
with
stubborn
determination
to
stifle
her
maid
was
busy
in
the
dressing
room
the
door
of
which
was
open
and
she
called
her
elizabeth
yes
and
the
maid
appeared
smiling
she
was
a
woman
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
she
had
come
to
angelica
when
the
latter
got
out
of
her
nurse
hands
and
remained
with
her
ever
since
angelica
being
one
of
those
mistresses
who
win
the
hearts
of
their
servants
by
recognizing
the
human
nature
in
them
and
appreciating
the
kindness
there
is
in
devotion
rather
than
accepting
it
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
obligation
to
earn
wages
bring
me
a
cup
of
coffee
elizabeth
yes
the
maid
rejoined
it
shall
be
ready
for
you
as
soon
as
you
have
had
your
bath
but
i
want
it
now
said
angelica
springing
out
of
bed
energetically
and
holding
first
one
slim
foot
and
then
the
other
out
to
be
shod
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
maid
eye
as
she
answered
please
you
made
me
promise
never
to
give
it
to
you
however
much
you
might
wish
it
until
you
had
had
your
bath
you
said
you
be
sure
to
ask
for
it
and
i
was
to
refuse
because
hot
coffee
was
bad
for
you
just
before
a
cold
bath
and
you
really
enjoyed
it
more
afterward
only
you
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
wait
quite
so
said
angelica
you
a
treasure
elizabeth
really
but
did
i
say
you
were
to
begin
no
not
in
particular
but
the
last
time
i
brought
it
to
you
early
you
scolded
me
after
you
had
taken
it
and
said
if
ever
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
again
you
dismiss
me
on
the
spot
and
you
warned
me
that
you
be
artful
and
get
it
out
of
me
somehow
if
i
did
take
care
so
i
did
said
angelica
she
had
been
brought
up
with
a
pretty
smart
shock
the
night
before
and
was
suffering
from
the
physical
effects
of
the
same
that
morning
the
mental
were
still
in
abeyance
she
felt
a
strange
lassitude
for
one
thing
and
was
strongly
inclined
to
indulge
it
by
being
indolent
she
breakfasted
in
her
own
room
but
could
not
eat
neither
could
she
read
she
turned
her
letters
over
then
tried
a
book
then
going
back
to
her
letters
again
she
picked
one
out
which
she
had
overlooked
before
it
was
from
her
husband
and
as
she
read
it
she
changed
countenance
somewhat
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
the
change
betokened
whether
pleasure
or
the
reverse
elizabeth
she
said
speaking
evenly
as
usual
your
master
is
coming
back
he
will
be
here
for
lunch
the
sickening
sense
of
loss
and
pain
which
had
assailed
her
when
she
awoke
that
morning
did
not
diminish
as
the
day
wore
on
nor
did
her
thoughts
grow
less
importunate
but
she
steadily
refused
to
entertain
any
of
them
or
to
let
her
mental
discomfort
interfere
with
her
occupations
after
reading
her
husband
letter
she
finished
dressing
had
a
long
interview
with
her
housekeeper
went
round
the
premises
as
was
her
daily
habit
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
and
then
retired
to
her
morning
room
and
set
to
work
methodically
to
write
orders
see
to
accounts
and
answer
letters
it
was
a
busy
day
with
her
and
she
had
only
just
finished
when
kilroy
arrived
she
went
to
meet
him
pleasantly
held
up
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
and
said
she
was
glad
he
was
in
time
for
lunch
there
was
no
sign
of
the
joy
or
effusion
with
which
young
wives
usually
receive
their
husbands
after
an
absence
but
the
greeting
was
eminently
friendly
angelica
had
always
had
a
strong
liking
for
kilroy
and
as
she
told
him
marriage
had
not
affected
this
in
any
way
she
had
made
a
friend
of
him
while
she
was
still
in
the
schoolroom
and
confided
to
him
many
things
which
she
would
not
have
mentioned
to
anyone
else
not
even
excepting
diavolo
and
she
continued
to
do
so
still
she
was
sure
of
his
sympathy
sure
of
his
devotion
and
she
respected
him
as
sincerely
as
she
trusted
him
in
fact
had
there
been
any
outlet
for
her
superfluous
mental
energy
any
satisfactory
purpose
to
which
the
motive
power
of
it
might
have
been
applied
she
would
have
made
kilroy
an
excellent
wife
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
but
she
probably
liked
him
all
the
better
on
that
account
for
she
must
have
been
disappointed
in
him
sooner
or
later
had
she
ever
discovered
in
him
those
marvellous
fascinations
which
passion
projects
from
itself
on
to
the
personality
of
the
most
commonplace
person
as
it
was
however
she
had
always
left
him
out
of
her
altogether
she
quite
believed
that
pleasure
is
the
end
of
life
but
then
her
ideal
of
pleasure
was
nice
in
the
extreme
nothing
so
vulgar
and
violent
as
passion
entered
into
it
and
nothing
so
transient
so
enervating
corroding
and
damaging
both
to
the
intellectual
powers
and
the
capacity
for
permanent
enjoyment
and
nothing
so
repulsive
either
in
its
details
its
egotistical
exaltation
and
the
which
arrives
with
that
final
sense
of
satiety
which
she
perceived
to
be
inevitable
that
part
of
her
nature
had
never
been
roused
into
active
life
partly
because
it
was
not
naturally
strong
but
also
because
the
more
refined
and
delicately
sensuous
appreciation
of
beauty
in
life
which
is
so
much
a
characteristic
of
capable
women
nowadays
dominated
such
animalism
as
she
was
equal
to
and
made
all
coarser
pleasures
repugnant
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
that
she
might
with
her
position
and
wealth
form
a
salon
and
lay
herself
out
to
attract
but
she
said
no
thank
you
one
sees
in
the
history
of
french
salons
the
effect
of
irresponsible
power
on
the
women
who
formed
them
i
am
bad
enough
naturally
without
applying
for
a
licence
to
become
worse
by
making
myself
so
agreeable
that
everybody
will
excuse
me
if
i
do
and
as
to
being
a
great
beauty
and
nothing
else
one
might
as
well
be
a
great
cow
the
comfort
would
be
the
same
and
the
anxiety
less
the
amount
of
attention
received
not
depending
on
a
clear
complexion
or
an
increase
of
figure
and
therefore
necessitating
no
limit
in
the
enjoyment
of
such
good
things
as
come
with
the
varying
seasons
the
winter
wurzel
and
summer
state
of
being
in
clover
it
was
to
kilroy
that
these
remarks
were
made
one
day
when
she
wanted
a
target
to
talk
at
for
her
appreciation
of
her
husband
did
not
amount
to
any
adequate
comprehension
of
the
extent
to
which
he
understood
her
the
truth
was
however
that
he
understood
her
better
than
anybody
else
did
the
complete
latitude
he
gave
to
her
to
do
as
she
liked
being
evidence
of
the
fact
if
only
she
could
have
interpreted
it
but
she
had
failed
to
do
so
his
quiet
undemonstrative
manner
having
sufficed
to
deceive
her
superficial
observation
of
him
as
effectually
as
the
treacherous
smoothness
of
her
own
placid
face
when
in
repose
upon
the
unruffled
surface
of
which
there
was
neither
mark
nor
sign
to
indicate
the
current
of
changeful
moods
ambitious
projects
and
poetical
fancies
which
coursed
impetuously
within
might
excusably
have
imposed
upon
him
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
angelica
and
looked
it
but
more
by
reason
of
his
grave
demeanour
than
from
any
actual
mark
of
age
for
his
life
had
been
well
ordered
and
as
free
from
care
as
it
had
been
from
corruption
kilroy
was
not
a
talkative
man
and
what
he
did
say
was
neither
original
nor
brilliant
yet
he
was
generally
trusted
and
his
advice
oftener
asked
and
followed
than
that
of
people
whose
reputations
were
at
least
as
good
and
whose
abilities
were
infinitely
better
the
explanation
of
which
was
probably
to
be
found
in
the
good
feeling
which
he
brought
to
the
consideration
of
all
subjects
some
people
whose
brains
would
be
at
fault
if
they
were
asked
to
judge
are
enabled
by
qualities
of
heart
to
feel
their
way
to
the
most
praiseworthy
conclusions
kilroy
was
one
of
those
people
and
of
ample
means
whom
society
recognizes
as
its
own
but
without
enthusiasm
the
sterling
qualities
which
make
them
such
an
addition
to
its
ranks
being
less
appreciated
than
the
wealth
and
position
which
they
contribute
to
its
resources
still
in
his
case
it
was
customary
for
women
to
describe
him
as
a
thoroughly
nice
man
while
an
exceedingly
good
fellow
was
the
corresponding
masculine
verdict
he
was
in
parliament
now
and
was
consequently
obliged
to
be
in
london
continually
but
latterly
angelica
had
refused
to
accompany
him
she
loved
their
place
near
morningquest
and
she
had
begun
to
appreciate
the
ancient
city
with
its
kindly
benighted
unchristian
ways
its
picturesqueness
and
all
that
was
odd
and
about
it
there
too
she
was
somebody
but
in
crowded
london
she
lost
all
sense
of
her
own
identity
though
to
do
her
justice
she
disliked
it
less
for
that
than
for
itself
for
its
hot
rooms
society
gossip
vapid
men
and
spiteful
women
kilroy
could
rarely
persuade
her
to
accompany
him
and
never
induce
her
to
stay
having
her
with
him
was
just
the
one
thing
that
he
was
a
little
persistent
about
and
her
wilfulness
in
this
respect
had
been
a
real
trouble
to
him
he
had
come
now
to
see
if
she
continued
obdurate
and
he
came
meekly
and
with
conciliation
in
his
whole
attitude
she
thought
however
that
she
knew
how
to
get
rid
of
him
how
to
make
him
return
alone
in
a
week
of
his
own
accord
so
far
as
he
himself
knew
anything
about
it
and
that
too
without
thinking
her
horrid
and
she
laid
her
plans
accordingly
this
was
something
to
do
and
so
irksome
did
she
find
the
purposeless
existence
which
the
misfortune
of
having
been
born
a
woman
compelled
her
to
lead
that
even
such
an
object
was
a
relief
and
her
spirits
rose
something
anything
for
an
occupation
that
was
the
state
to
which
she
was
reduced
she
began
at
once
and
began
by
talking
all
through
lunch
she
discoursed
admirably
and
at
first
kilroy
listened
fascinated
but
by
and
by
his
attention
became
strained
he
found
himself
forced
to
listen
it
was
an
effort
and
yet
he
could
not
help
himself
he
tried
to
check
angelica
by
assuming
an
absent
look
but
she
recalled
him
with
a
sharp
exclamation
he
even
took
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
read
the
superscription
but
put
it
away
again
shamefacedly
upon
her
gently
apologizing
for
monopolizing
so
much
of
his
attention
you
see
it
is
so
long
since
i
saw
you
she
said
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
have
too
much
to
say
when
lunch
was
over
the
carriage
came
round
and
angelica
all
radiant
smiles
took
it
for
granted
that
kilroy
would
go
with
her
for
a
drive
now
if
there
were
one
thing
which
he
disliked
more
than
another
it
was
a
stupid
drive
there
and
back
without
an
object
but
angelica
seemed
so
uncommonly
glad
to
see
him
he
did
not
like
to
refuse
he
had
many
things
to
attend
to
but
he
felt
that
it
would
be
bad
policy
not
to
humour
her
mood
especially
as
it
was
such
an
extremely
encouraging
one
so
he
went
to
please
her
with
perfect
good
grace
although
he
could
not
help
thinking
regretfully
of
the
precious
time
he
was
losing
of
the
accumulation
of
things
there
were
to
be
seen
to
about
his
own
place
and
of
some
important
letters
he
ought
to
have
written
that
afternoon
angelica
beguiled
him
successfully
on
the
way
out
however
so
that
he
did
not
notice
the
distance
but
on
the
way
back
her
manner
changed
so
far
she
had
been
all
brightness
and
animation
now
she
became
lugubrious
and
took
a
morbid
view
of
things
she
talked
of
all
the
men
of
middle
age
who
had
died
lately
and
of
what
they
had
died
of
showing
that
most
of
them
were
taken
off
suddenly
when
in
perfect
health
apparently
and
usually
without
any
premonitory
symptoms
of
disease
it
was
all
the
result
of
some
change
of
habits
she
said
which
was
always
dangerous
in
the
case
of
men
of
middle
age
and
kilroy
began
to
feel
uneasy
in
spite
of
himself
for
he
had
been
obliged
to
alter
his
own
habits
considerably
when
he
married
and
he
was
apt
to
be
a
little
nervous
about
his
health
consequently
he
was
much
depressed
when
they
returned
and
finding
that
he
had
missed
the
post
did
not
tend
to
raise
his
spirits
angelica
came
down
to
dinner
dressed
in
pale
green
with
something
yellow
on
her
head
kilroy
admired
her
immensely
she
was
the
only
subject
upon
which
he
ever
became
poetical
and
somehow
the
combination
of
colours
she
wore
on
this
occasion
with
her
lithe
young
figure
and
skin
made
him
think
of
an
arum
lily
and
he
told
her
so
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
pretty
compliment
when
he
had
paid
it
and
with
the
dinner
and
everything
the
fatal
age
was
forgotten
and
he
allowed
himself
to
be
cheered
by
hopes
of
success
in
his
present
mission
he
had
not
yet
mentioned
it
but
when
they
were
left
alone
at
dessert
he
began
is
my
châtelaine
tired
of
seclusion
and
willing
to
return
with
me
to
the
great
wicked
city
he
ventured
with
an
affectation
of
playfulness
which
rather
betrayed
than
concealed
his
very
real
anxiety
a
wife
place
is
by
her
husband
your
châtelaine
is
not
tired
of
seclusion
she
answered
in
a
cheerful
matter
of
fact
tone
and
it
is
a
wife
duty
to
look
after
her
house
and
keep
it
well
for
him
especially
in
his
absence
but
how
much
will
you
give
me
to
go
my
private
purse
is
empty
kilroy
laughed
it
always
is
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
said
but
a
mercenary
arum
lily
what
an
anomaly
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
pounds
to
buy
dolls
if
you
will
go
back
with
me
next
week
angelica
appeared
to
reflect
i
will
take
fifty
thank
you
and
stay
where
i
am
she
answered
with
decision
kilroy
countenance
fell
if
you
will
not
come
back
with
me
you
shall
not
have
any
he
said
with
equal
firmness
then
i
shall
be
obliged
to
make
it
she
rejoined
with
a
schoolgirl
grin
of
delight
this
threat
to
make
money
with
her
violin
had
kept
her
purse
full
ever
since
her
marriage
not
that
it
was
ever
really
empty
for
she
had
had
a
handsome
settlement
kilroy
however
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
inspect
his
wife
and
besides
whether
she
had
money
or
not
if
it
amused
her
to
obtain
more
he
never
could
be
quite
sure
that
she
would
not
carry
out
that
dreadful
threat
and
try
to
make
it
he
knew
she
would
be
only
too
glad
of
an
excuse
knew
too
that
if
ever
she
tried
she
would
be
certain
to
succeed
what
with
her
talent
presence
family
and
the
interest
which
the
young
wife
of
an
elderly
curmudgeon
that
was
the
character
she
meant
to
assume
she
said
was
sure
to
excite
she
did
not
care
for
money
it
was
the
pleasure
of
the
chase
that
delighted
her
the
fun
of
extorting
it
if
kilroy
had
given
her
all
she
asked
for
without
any
trouble
she
would
have
soon
left
off
asking
but
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
refuse
by
way
of
discipline
seeing
that
she
was
so
young
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
indulge
her
extravagance
and
he
did
his
best
to
curb
the
inclination
gently
before
it
became
a
confirmed
habit
after
dinner
he
went
to
the
library
to
write
those
important
letters
and
angelica
retired
to
the
drawing
room
the
night
was
close
doors
and
windows
stood
wide
open
and
she
got
a
violin
and
began
to
tune
it
she
was
too
good
a
musician
not
to
be
able
to
make
the
instrument
an
instrument
of
torture
if
she
chose
and
now
she
did
choose
she
made
it
screak
she
made
it
wail
she
set
her
own
teeth
on
edge
with
the
horrid
discords
she
drew
from
it
it
crowed
like
a
cock
times
running
with
an
interval
of
half
a
minute
between
each
crow
it
brayed
like
two
asses
on
a
common
one
answering
the
other
from
a
considerable
distance
and
then
it
became
ten
cats
quarreling
with
a
pause
after
every
violent
outburst
broken
at
intervals
by
an
occasional
howl
kilroy
endured
the
nuisance
up
to
that
point
heroically
but
at
last
he
felt
compelled
to
send
a
servant
to
tell
angelica
that
he
was
writing
oh
she
observed
perversely
choosing
to
misinterpret
the
purport
of
this
tactful
message
then
i
need
not
wait
for
him
any
longer
i
suppose
bring
me
my
coffee
please
the
man
withdrew
and
she
proceeded
with
the
torture
kilroy
shut
his
doors
and
windows
hoping
to
exclude
the
sound
when
he
found
the
hint
had
been
lost
upon
her
in
vain
the
library
was
near
the
drawing
room
and
every
note
was
audible
angelica
was
stumbling
over
an
air
now
a
dismal
minor
thing
which
would
have
been
quite
bad
enough
had
she
played
it
properly
but
as
it
was
being
apparently
too
difficult
for
her
she
made
it
distracting
working
her
way
up
painfully
to
one
particular
part
where
she
always
broke
down
then
going
back
and
beginning
all
over
again
twenty
times
at
least
till
kilroy
got
the
thing
on
the
brain
and
found
himself
forced
to
wait
for
the
catastrophe
each
time
she
approached
the
place
where
she
stumbled
presently
he
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
and
a
deprecating
air
he
suspected
no
malice
and
only
came
to
remonstrate
mildly
angelica
my
dear
he
began
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
i
really
can
not
write
i
have
been
overworked
lately
or
i
am
tired
with
the
journey
down
or
something
my
head
is
a
little
confused
in
fact
and
a
trifle
distracts
me
would
you
mind
angelica
put
down
her
violin
with
an
injured
air
oh
i
do
mind
of
course
she
protested
in
a
tone
which
contradicted
the
assertion
flatly
but
it
is
very
hard
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
you
are
so
seldom
at
home
and
when
you
here
you
do
nothing
but
write
stupid
letters
and
never
come
near
me
and
this
time
you
are
horrid
and
cross
about
everything
it
is
such
a
disappointment
when
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
your
return
her
voice
broke
i
wish
i
had
never
asked
you
to
marry
me
you
ought
not
to
have
done
so
it
was
not
right
of
you
if
you
only
meant
to
neglect
me
and
make
me
miserable
you
wo
do
anything
for
me
now
not
even
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
write
out
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
though
it
would
not
take
you
a
minute
two
great
tears
overflowed
as
she
spoke
and
she
raised
her
handkerchief
with
ostentatious
slowness
to
dry
them
kilroy
was
much
distressed
my
child
he
exclaimed
sitting
down
beside
her
there
there
angelica
now
do
please
for
angelica
was
shivering
and
crying
in
earnest
a
natural
consequence
of
her
immersion
on
the
previous
night
and
the
state
of
mind
which
had
ensued
i
am
obliged
to
write
these
letters
i
am
indeed
i
ought
to
have
done
them
this
afternoon
but
i
went
out
with
you
you
know
you
really
are
unjust
to
me
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
do
not
think
it
is
right
for
you
to
be
so
much
alone
but
you
will
not
listen
to
me
come
and
sit
with
me
now
in
the
library
i
would
much
rather
have
you
with
me
i
would
have
asked
you
before
but
i
was
afraid
it
might
bore
you
come
now
do
no
i
should
only
fidget
and
disturb
you
she
answered
but
in
a
mollified
tone
well
then
he
replied
i
will
go
and
finish
as
fast
as
i
can
and
come
back
to
you
here
and
do
fret
my
dear
child
you
know
there
is
nothing
in
reason
i
would
not
do
for
you
in
proof
of
which
he
sent
the
butler
a
little
later
by
way
of
breaking
the
length
of
his
absence
agreeably
with
what
looked
like
a
letter
on
a
silver
salver
angelica
opened
it
and
found
a
cheque
for
a
hundred
pounds
when
she
was
alone
again
she
beamed
round
upon
the
silent
company
of
chairs
and
tables
much
pleased
then
her
conscience
smote
her
he
is
really
very
good
she
said
to
herself
far
too
good
for
me
i
do
think
i
ever
could
have
married
anybody
else
but
there
was
something
dubious
that
resembled
a
question
in
this
last
phrase
the
next
day
was
hopelessly
miserable
out
of
doors
raining
gusty
cold
kilroy
was
not
sorry
he
had
a
good
deal
of
business
connected
with
his
property
to
attend
to
and
did
not
want
to
go
out
and
angelica
was
not
sorry
she
had
some
little
plans
of
her
own
to
carry
out
which
a
wet
day
rather
favoured
than
otherwise
having
finished
her
accustomed
morning
work
and
being
obliged
to
stay
in
it
was
natural
that
she
should
try
to
amuse
herself
also
natural
that
she
should
try
something
in
the
way
of
exercise
so
she
collected
some
dozen
curs
she
kept
about
the
place
demonstrative
mongrels
for
the
most
part
but
all
intelligent
and
brought
them
into
the
hall
where
she
made
them
run
races
for
biscuits
the
being
to
place
a
biscuit
on
the
top
step
of
a
broad
flight
of
stairs
there
was
at
one
end
of
the
hall
then
to
collect
the
dogs
at
the
other
make
them
stand
in
a
row
a
difficult
task
to
begin
with
but
easy
enough
when
they
understood
which
was
very
soon
although
not
without
much
shrieking
of
orders
from
angelica
and
responsive
barking
on
their
part
and
then
start
them
with
a
whip
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
took
the
biscuit
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
others
fought
him
for
it
it
was
indescribably
funny
to
see
the
whole
pack
tear
up
all
eagerness
and
then
come
down
again
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
excitement
of
the
scrimmage
some
of
them
losing
their
tempers
but
all
of
them
enjoying
the
game
returning
of
their
own
accord
to
the
starting
point
waiting
with
yelps
of
excitement
and
eyes
brightly
intent
ears
pricked
jaws
open
tongues
hanging
tails
wagging
sides
panting
till
another
biscuit
was
placed
then
off
once
more
sometimes
after
a
false
start
or
two
caused
by
the
impetuosity
of
a
little
yapping
terrier
which
rush
before
the
signal
was
given
and
had
to
be
brought
back
with
the
whip
the
other
dogs
looking
disgusted
meanwhile
like
honourable
gentlemen
at
a
cad
who
wo
play
fair
angelica
shouting
and
laughing
made
as
much
noise
in
her
way
as
the
dogs
did
in
theirs
and
the
din
was
deafening
an
exasperating
kind
of
din
too
not
incessant
but
intermittent
now
swelling
to
a
climax
now
lulling
until
there
seemed
some
hope
that
it
would
cease
altogether
then
bursting
out
again
whip
cracking
dogs
howling
and
barking
feet
scampering
angelica
shrieking
worse
than
ever
presently
kilroy
appeared
with
remonstrance
written
on
every
line
of
his
countenance
my
dear
angelica
he
said
unable
to
conceal
his
quite
justifiable
annoyance
i
can
do
nothing
if
this
racket
continues
and
deprecatingly
is
it
is
it
quite
seemly
for
you
i
used
to
do
it
at
home
angelica
answered
but
you
are
not
at
home
now
quick
as
light
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
her
great
grieved
eyes
i
mean
he
grew
confused
in
his
haste
to
correct
himself
of
course
you
are
at
home
very
much
so
indeed
you
know
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
as
the
mistress
of
a
large
establishment
dignity
setting
an
example
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
see
none
of
the
servants
are
about
at
this
hour
angelica
answered
it
is
their
dinner
time
but
i
apologize
for
my
thoughtlessness
if
i
have
disturbed
you
she
smiled
up
at
him
as
she
spoke
and
poor
kilroy
retired
to
the
library
quite
disarmed
by
her
gentleness
and
blaming
himself
for
a
selfish
brute
to
have
interfered
with
her
innocent
amusement
in
future
he
determined
he
would
make
more
allowance
for
her
youth
angelica
meanwhile
had
collected
her
dogs
and
disappeared
but
presently
she
returned
and
followed
kilroy
to
the
library
he
was
busy
writing
and
she
went
and
stood
in
the
window
looking
idly
out
at
the
rain
and
drumming
absently
as
it
seemed
on
the
panes
with
ten
strong
fingers
till
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
my
dear
child
he
exclaimed
at
last
ca
you
get
something
to
do
angelica
stopped
instantly
if
her
thoughtlessness
was
exasperating
her
docility
was
exemplary
but
she
seemed
disheartened
then
she
seemed
to
consider
then
she
brightened
a
little
then
she
got
some
letters
sat
down
and
began
to
write
scratch
scratch
scratch
squeak
squeak
squeak
on
rough
paper
with
a
quill
pen
writing
in
furious
haste
at
a
table
just
behind
her
husband
why
did
she
choose
the
library
his
own
private
for
the
purpose
when
there
were
half
a
dozen
other
rooms
at
least
where
she
might
have
been
quite
as
comfortable
kilroy
fidgeted
uneasily
but
he
bore
this
new
infliction
silently
though
with
an
sense
of
irritation
for
some
time
finally
however
an
exclamation
of
impatience
slipped
from
him
unawares
do
i
worry
you
with
my
scribbling
angelica
demanded
with
hypocritical
concern
i
sorry
but
i
just
done
and
she
went
away
with
some
half
dozen
notes
for
the
post
when
they
met
again
at
lunch
she
told
him
triumphantly
that
she
had
refused
all
the
invitations
which
had
come
for
him
since
his
arrival
on
account
of
his
health
she
had
told
everybody
that
he
had
come
home
for
perfect
rest
and
quiet
which
he
much
needed
after
the
strain
of
his
parliamentary
duties
and
as
one
of
the
notes
at
least
would
be
read
at
a
public
meeting
to
explain
his
absence
therefrom
and
would
afterward
appear
in
the
papers
probably
she
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
anywhere
during
his
stay
kilroy
could
not
complain
however
for
had
he
not
himself
said
only
last
night
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
overwork
and
so
alarmed
her
and
he
would
not
have
complained
in
any
case
when
he
saw
her
so
joyfully
triumphant
in
the
belief
that
she
had
cleverly
eased
him
from
an
oppressing
number
of
duties
but
he
determined
to
pick
his
excuses
more
carefully
another
time
for
the
prospect
of
a
prolonged
with
angelica
in
her
present
humour
somewhat
appalled
his
soul
and
the
thought
of
it
did
just
stir
him
sufficiently
for
the
moment
to
cause
him
to
venture
to
suggest
that
in
future
it
might
be
as
well
for
her
to
consult
him
before
she
answered
for
him
in
any
matter
angelica
replied
with
an
intelligent
nod
and
smile
she
was
altogether
charming
in
these
days
in
spite
of
her
perverseness
and
kilroy
while
groaning
inwardly
at
her
irritating
tricks
was
also
touched
and
flattered
by
the
anxiety
she
displayed
for
his
comfort
and
welfare
he
hoped
to
enjoy
a
quiet
cigar
and
a
book
after
luncheon
but
angelica
had
another
notion
in
her
head
she
went
to
the
drawing
room
opened
doors
and
windows
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
began
to
sing
shakes
scales
intervals
the
whole
exercise
book
through
apparently
from
beginning
to
end
and
with
such
good
will
that
her
voice
resounded
throughout
the
house
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
so
as
to
be
able
to
produce
it
with
the
desired
effect
and
there
was
no
escape
from
the
sound
but
poor
kilroy
did
not
like
to
interfere
with
her
industry
as
he
had
done
with
her
idleness
he
was
afraid
he
had
shown
too
much
impatience
already
for
one
day
so
he
endured
this
further
trial
without
exhibiting
a
sign
of
suffering
but
after
an
hour
or
two
of
it
he
found
himself
sighing
for
the
undisturbed
repose
of
his
house
in
town
in
a
way
that
would
have
satisfied
angelica
had
she
known
it
at
dinner
she
looked
very
nice
but
she
did
not
talk
much
conversation
was
not
kilroy
strong
point
but
he
was
good
at
anecdotes
and
now
he
racked
his
brains
for
something
new
to
tell
her
she
listened
however
without
seeming
to
see
the
point
of
some
and
others
caused
her
to
stare
at
him
in
astonishment
as
if
shocked
which
made
him
pause
awkwardly
to
consider
half
fearing
to
find
some
impropriety
which
his
coarser
masculine
mind
had
hitherto
failed
to
detect
this
caused
the
flow
of
reminiscences
to
languish
and
presently
to
cease
then
angelica
began
to
make
bread
pills
she
set
them
in
a
row
and
flipped
them
off
the
table
one
by
one
deliberately
when
the
servants
left
the
room
this
amusement
ended
she
pulled
flowers
to
pieces
between
the
courses
and
hummed
a
little
tune
kilroy
fidgeted
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
saying
do
ever
since
he
came
home
and
he
would
not
now
repeat
it
but
the
disagreed
with
him
and
so
did
his
dinner
dyspepsia
having
waited
on
appetite
in
lieu
of
digestion
after
dinner
angelica
induced
him
to
go
with
her
to
the
drawing
room
and
when
she
had
got
him
comfortably
seated
and
had
given
him
his
coffee
and
a
paper
and
just
peace
enough
to
let
him
fall
into
a
pleasurably
drowsy
state
accompanied
by
a
strong
disinclination
to
move
she
began
to
pick
out
the
dead
march
in
saul
and
kindred
melodies
with
one
finger
on
the
piano
kilroy
bore
this
infliction
also
but
when
she
brought
a
cookery
book
and
insisted
on
reading
the
recipes
aloud
he
went
to
bed
in
chapter
ii
if
the
first
and
second
days
at
home
were
failures
so
far
as
comfort
was
concerned
the
third
was
as
bad
if
not
worse
it
was
a
continual
case
of
please
do
from
morning
till
night
and
angelica
herself
was
touched
at
last
by
the
kindly
nature
which
could
repeat
the
remonstrance
so
often
and
so
patiently
but
all
the
same
she
did
not
forbear
all
that
day
however
kilroy
made
every
allowance
for
her
angelica
was
thoughtless
very
thoughtless
but
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
be
so
considering
her
youth
on
the
next
day
however
it
did
occur
to
him
that
she
was
far
too
exacting
for
she
would
not
let
him
leave
her
for
a
moment
if
she
could
help
it
and
on
the
next
he
was
sufficiently
depressed
to
acknowledge
that
angelica
was
trying
and
if
he
did
not
actually
sigh
for
solitude
he
felt
at
all
events
that
it
would
cost
him
no
effort
to
resign
himself
to
it
if
she
should
again
prove
refractory
and
refuse
to
go
back
with
him
and
angelica
knew
that
he
had
arrived
at
this
state
just
as
well
as
if
he
had
told
her
but
still
she
was
far
from
content
she
wanted
him
to
go
and
she
wanted
him
to
stay
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
she
teased
him
with
as
much
zeal
as
at
first
but
the
amusement
had
ceased
to
distract
her
in
the
least
degree
it
had
become
quite
a
business
now
and
she
only
kept
it
up
because
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
she
was
conscious
of
some
change
in
herself
conscious
of
a
racking
spirit
of
discontent
which
tormented
her
and
of
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
her
superabundant
vitality
she
had
lost
all
zest
for
anything
outwardly
and
also
as
a
matter
of
habit
when
she
was
with
anybody
who
might
have
noticed
a
change
she
maintained
the
dignity
of
demeanour
which
she
had
begun
to
cultivate
in
society
upon
her
marriage
but
inwardly
she
raged
raged
at
herself
at
everybody
at
everything
and
this
mood
again
was
varied
by
two
others
one
of
unnatural
quiescence
the
other
of
feverish
restlessness
in
the
one
she
would
sit
for
hours
at
a
time
doing
nothing
not
even
pretending
to
occupy
herself
in
the
other
she
would
wander
aimlessly
up
and
down
would
walk
about
the
room
and
look
at
the
pictures
without
seeing
them
or
go
upstairs
for
nothing
and
come
down
again
without
perceiving
the
folly
of
it
all
and
she
was
forever
thinking
diavolo
was
at
sandhurst
if
only
he
had
been
at
ilverthorpe
she
might
have
talked
to
him
she
tried
the
effect
of
a
letter
full
of
allusions
which
should
have
aroused
his
curiosity
if
not
his
sympathetic
interest
but
he
made
no
remark
about
these
in
his
reply
and
only
wrote
about
himself
and
his
pranks
which
seemed
intolerably
childish
and
stupid
to
angelica
in
her
present
mood
and
about
his
objection
to
early
rising
and
regular
hours
all
of
which
she
knew
so
that
the
repetition
only
irritated
her
she
considered
kilroy
obtuse
and
thought
bitterly
that
anyone
with
a
scrap
of
intelligent
interest
in
her
must
have
noticed
that
she
had
something
on
her
mind
and
won
her
confidence
this
reflection
occurred
to
her
in
the
drawing
room
one
night
after
dinner
and
immediately
afterward
she
caught
him
looking
at
her
with
a
grave
intensity
which
should
have
puzzled
her
if
it
did
not
strike
her
as
significant
of
some
deeper
feeling
than
that
to
which
the
carnal
admiration
for
her
person
which
she
expected
and
despised
would
have
given
rise
but
she
was
too
to
be
more
observant
than
she
gave
him
the
credit
of
being
the
result
of
kilroy
observation
was
an
effort
to
take
her
out
of
herself
he
began
by
asking
her
to
play
to
him
not
very
graciously
she
got
out
a
violin
remarking
that
she
was
sorry
it
was
not
her
best
one
where
is
your
best
one
he
asked
it
is
not
at
home
she
answered
i
left
it
with
israfil
my
friend
you
know
she
spoke
slowly
holding
the
end
of
the
violin
and
tightening
the
strings
as
she
did
so
the
effort
causing
her
to
compress
her
lips
so
that
the
words
were
uttered
disjointedly
and
as
she
finished
speaking
she
raised
the
instrument
to
her
shoulder
and
her
eyes
to
kilroy
face
into
which
she
gazed
intently
as
she
drew
her
bow
across
the
strings
testing
them
as
to
whether
they
were
in
tune
or
not
and
seeming
rather
to
listen
than
to
look
as
she
did
so
kilroy
still
quietly
observing
her
noticed
that
her
equanimity
had
been
suddenly
restored
but
whether
it
was
the
mellow
tones
of
her
violin
or
some
happy
thought
that
had
released
the
tension
he
could
not
tell
it
was
as
much
relief
however
to
him
to
see
her
brighten
as
it
was
to
her
to
feel
when
she
answered
him
that
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
and
she
would
now
be
able
to
talk
it
out
this
trouble
that
oppressed
her
unrestrainedly
as
was
natural
to
her
when
kilroy
accepted
the
terms
upon
which
she
proposed
to
marry
him
namely
that
he
should
let
her
do
as
she
liked
she
had
voluntarily
promised
to
tell
him
everything
she
did
and
she
had
kept
her
word
as
was
her
wont
telling
him
the
exact
truth
as
on
this
occasion
but
mixing
it
up
with
so
many
romances
that
he
never
knew
which
was
which
he
was
in
town
when
she
first
met
the
tenor
but
when
he
returned
she
told
him
all
that
had
happened
and
continued
the
story
from
time
to
time
as
the
various
episodes
occurred
making
it
extremely
interesting
and
also
almost
picturesque
kilroy
knew
the
tenor
by
reputation
of
course
and
was
much
entertained
by
what
he
believed
to
be
the
romance
which
angelica
was
weaving
about
his
interesting
personality
he
suggested
that
she
should
write
it
just
as
she
told
it
i
have
not
seen
anything
like
it
anywhere
he
said
nothing
half
so
lifelike
oh
but
then
you
see
this
is
all
she
gravely
insisted
oh
of
course
he
answered
smiling
and
now
when
she
answered
that
she
had
left
her
best
violin
with
the
tenor
it
reminded
him
by
the
by
yes
he
said
how
does
the
story
progress
i
was
thinking
about
it
in
the
train
on
my
way
home
but
i
forgot
to
ask
you
other
things
have
put
it
out
of
my
head
since
i
arrived
and
out
of
mine
too
said
angelica
thoughtfully
at
least
i
forgot
to
tell
you
which
is
extraordinary
by
the
way
for
matters
are
now
so
complicated
between
us
that
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
it
will
be
quite
a
relief
to
discuss
the
subject
with
you
she
drew
up
a
little
chair
and
sat
down
opposite
to
him
with
her
violin
across
her
knee
and
began
immediately
and
with
great
earnestness
looking
up
at
him
as
she
spoke
she
described
all
that
had
happened
on
that
last
sad
occasion
minutely
the
row
down
the
river
the
moonrise
the
music
the
accident
the
rescue
the
discovery
and
its
effect
upon
the
tenor
and
all
with
her
accustomed
picturesqueness
speaking
in
the
first
person
singular
and
with
such
force
and
fluency
that
kilroy
was
completely
carried
away
and
declared
as
on
previous
occasions
that
she
set
the
whole
thing
before
him
so
vividly
he
found
it
impossible
not
to
believe
every
word
of
it
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
he
asked
with
his
indulgent
smile
when
she
had
told
him
all
that
there
was
to
tell
at
present
you
can
not
end
it
there
you
know
it
would
be
such
a
lame
conclusion
that
was
just
what
i
thought
she
answered
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
as
a
man
of
the
world
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
well
he
began
then
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
her
up
from
her
little
chair
will
you
come
out
and
sit
on
the
terrace
he
said
and
allow
me
to
smoke
the
night
is
warm
angelica
nodded
and
preceded
him
through
one
of
the
open
windows
well
kilroy
resumed
when
he
had
lit
his
cigar
and
settled
himself
in
a
cane
chair
comfortably
with
angelica
in
another
opposite
what
a
lovely
night
it
is
after
the
rain
yesterday
this
by
way
of
parenthesis
rather
close
though
he
observed
and
then
he
returned
to
the
subject
i
suppose
you
mean
that
you
do
not
want
it
to
be
all
over
between
you
the
tenor
and
the
she
corrected
the
whole
charm
of
the
acquaintance
do
you
see
for
me
consisted
in
that
footing
i
do
know
how
to
express
it
but
perhaps
you
can
grasp
what
i
mean
kilroy
reflected
i
am
afraid
he
said
at
last
that
footing
can
not
be
resumed
the
influences
of
sex
once
the
difference
is
recognized
are
involuntary
but
if
he
has
no
objection
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
be
friends
and
intimate
friends
too
and
with
that
sort
of
man
you
might
make
some
advance
especially
as
you
are
entirely
in
the
wrong
i
am
not
saying
you
know
that
this
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
as
a
rule
but
here
are
exceptional
circumstances
and
here
is
an
exceptional
man
now
that
is
significant
said
angelica
jeering
society
is
so
demoralized
that
if
a
man
is
caught
conducting
himself
with
decency
and
honour
on
all
occasions
when
a
woman
is
in
question
you
involuntarily
exclaim
that
he
is
an
exceptional
man
kilroy
smoked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
quiet
stars
his
attitude
expressed
nothing
but
extreme
quiescence
yet
angelica
felt
reproved
do
snub
me
daddy
she
exclaimed
at
last
i
came
to
you
in
my
difficulty
and
you
do
not
seem
to
care
kilroy
looked
at
his
cigar
and
flicked
the
ash
from
the
end
of
it
tell
me
how
to
get
out
of
this
horrid
dilemma
angelica
pursued
i
shall
never
know
a
moment
peace
until
we
have
resumed
our
acquaintance
on
a
different
footing
and
i
have
been
able
to
make
him
some
reparation
ah
reparation
said
kilroy
dubiously
do
you
think
it
is
impossible
angelica
demanded
not
impossible
perhaps
but
very
difficult
he
answered
really
angelica
he
broke
off
laughingly
i
quite
forget
every
now
and
again
that
we
are
romancing
you
must
write
this
story
for
we
are
romancing
she
said
impatiently
and
i
could
write
it
it
is
too
painful
besides
we
do
seem
to
get
any
further
let
me
see
where
we
were
kilroy
replied
humouring
her
it
is
a
pity
you
can
not
unmarry
yourself
you
see
being
married
complicates
matters
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
if
you
had
been
single
a
girl
might
under
certain
circumstances
be
forgiven
for
an
escapade
of
the
kind
but
when
a
married
woman
does
such
a
thing
it
is
very
different
still
if
you
can
get
well
out
of
it
of
course
the
difficulty
will
make
the
all
the
more
interesting
but
i
do
see
how
i
am
to
get
well
out
of
it
unless
you
will
go
to
him
yourself
and
tell
him
you
know
the
whole
story
and
do
whatever
your
tact
and
goodness
suggest
to
set
the
matter
right
she
bent
forward
with
her
arms
folded
on
her
lap
looking
up
at
him
eagerly
as
she
spoke
and
beating
a
devil
tattoo
with
her
slender
feet
on
the
ground
impatiently
the
while
no
he
answered
deliberately
that
would
not
be
natural
you
see
either
you
must
be
objectionable
or
your
husband
must
and
upon
the
whole
i
think
you
had
better
sacrifice
the
husband
otherwise
you
lose
your
readers
sympathy
make
objectionable
daddy
angelica
exclaimed
the
thing
is
not
to
be
done
i
could
never
have
asked
you
to
marry
me
if
you
had
been
objectionable
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
so
either
entirely
you
know
if
i
had
been
quite
horrid
i
should
not
have
appreciated
you
and
the
tenor
and
uncle
dawne
and
galbraith
oh
dear
why
is
it
when
good
men
are
so
scarce
that
i
should
know
so
many
and
yet
be
tormented
with
the
further
knowledge
that
you
are
all
exceptional
and
crime
and
misery
continue
because
it
is
so
what
is
the
use
of
knowing
when
one
can
do
nothing
again
kilroy
looked
up
at
the
quiet
stars
but
angelica
gave
him
no
time
to
reflect
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
severely
consistent
she
said
let
me
be
a
mixture
not
a
foul
mixture
but
one
of
those
which
eventually
result
in
something
agreeable
after
going
through
a
period
of
fermentation
during
which
they
throw
up
an
unpleasant
scum
that
has
to
be
removed
that
would
do
kilroy
responded
gravely
but
just
now
angelica
resumed
it
seems
as
if
i
should
be
obliged
to
let
matters
take
their
course
and
do
nothing
which
is
intolerable
oh
but
you
must
do
something
kilroy
decided
and
the
first
thing
will
be
to
go
to
him
go
to
him
she
ejaculated
well
yes
he
rejoined
naturally
you
will
feel
it
now
that
you
are
no
longer
made
courageous
by
his
unsuspicious
confidence
i
mean
the
tenor
it
is
quite
proper
for
you
to
be
shy
and
ashamed
of
yourself
as
a
woman
of
course
you
are
not
wanting
in
modesty
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
he
would
never
come
to
you
so
you
must
go
to
him
i
quite
think
that
you
owe
him
any
reparation
you
can
make
and
knowing
the
sort
of
man
he
is
you
have
made
his
character
well
known
in
the
place
have
you
not
angelica
nodded
well
then
a
visit
from
a
lady
of
your
rank
will
create
no
scandal
nor
even
cause
any
surprise
i
should
think
if
you
go
quite
openly
for
you
are
known
to
be
a
musician
and
might
therefore
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
business
with
one
of
the
profession
i
wish
you
had
made
him
an
ugly
man
with
kind
eyes
you
know
it
would
have
been
more
original
i
think
but
you
will
find
out
who
he
is
of
course
no
i
hardly
think
so
angelica
answered
but
you
would
advise
me
to
go
to
him
this
by
way
of
bringing
him
back
to
the
subject
yes
with
a
vigorous
attempt
to
draw
his
cigar
to
life
again
it
having
gone
all
but
out
i
should
advise
you
to
go
to
him
boldly
by
day
of
course
and
just
make
him
forgive
you
insist
on
it
you
will
find
he
can
not
resist
you
then
you
will
start
afresh
on
a
new
footing
as
you
wish
and
the
whole
thing
will
end
happily
you
forget
though
he
did
forgive
me
there
are
various
kinds
of
forgiveness
kilroy
replied
there
is
the
forgiveness
that
washes
its
hands
of
the
culprit
and
refuses
to
be
further
troubled
on
his
behalf
the
least
estimable
form
of
forgiveness
and
there
is
that
which
proves
itself
sincere
by
the
effort
which
is
afterward
made
to
help
the
penitent
that
is
the
kind
of
forgiveness
you
should
try
to
secure
but
somehow
it
still
seems
unfinished
angelica
grumbled
if
you
had
been
single
now
kilroy
suggested
you
would
in
the
natural
course
of
events
have
married
the
tenor
oh
no
angelica
vigorously
interposed
i
should
never
have
wanted
to
marry
him
ca
i
make
you
understand
the
side
of
my
nature
which
i
turned
to
him
as
is
the
only
one
he
has
touched
and
i
could
never
care
for
him
in
any
other
relation
well
i
do
know
kilroy
observed
thoughtfully
it
may
be
so
of
course
but
it
is
unusual
and
so
am
i
unusual
angelica
answered
quickly
but
there
will
be
plenty
more
like
me
by
and
by
now
do
look
forbid
at
me
in
that
way
that
was
not
in
the
least
what
i
intended
to
express
he
answered
with
his
kindly
smile
indulgent
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
your
own
idea
of
loving
him
without
being
in
love
with
him
is
the
best
it
is
so
much
less
commonplace
but
what
do
you
think
speaking
as
if
struck
by
a
bright
idea
what
do
you
think
of
putting
him
under
a
great
obligation
which
will
bind
him
to
you
in
gratitude
and
secure
his
friendship
you
might
with
great
courage
and
devotion
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
find
out
all
about
him
prove
him
to
be
a
prince
or
something
the
heir
to
great
estates
and
hereditary
privileges
with
congenial
duties
attached
the
idea
is
not
exactly
new
but
your
treatment
of
it
would
be
sure
to
be
original
angelica
interrupted
him
by
a
decisive
shake
of
her
head
but
about
going
to
him
she
demanded
you
do
not
think
speaking
as
a
man
of
the
world
yourself
and
remembering
that
he
knows
the
world
too
although
he
such
a
saint
you
do
not
think
such
a
proceeding
on
my
part
will
lower
me
still
further
in
his
estimation
well
no
kilroy
replied
i
feel
quite
sure
it
will
have
just
the
opposite
effect
as
a
man
of
the
world
he
will
know
what
it
has
cost
a
young
lady
like
you
to
humble
herself
to
that
extent
as
a
saint
he
will
appreciate
the
act
looking
at
it
in
the
light
of
a
penance
which
in
point
of
fact
it
would
be
and
as
a
human
being
he
will
be
touched
by
your
confidence
in
him
and
the
value
you
set
upon
his
esteem
so
that
altogether
i
am
convinced
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
do
angelica
made
no
reply
but
got
up
languidly
after
a
moment
thought
carefully
ruffled
his
hair
with
both
hands
as
she
passed
called
him
dear
old
daddy
and
retired
kilroy
did
not
like
to
have
his
hair
ruffled
in
that
way
particularly
as
he
was
apt
to
forget
and
appear
in
public
with
it
all
standing
up
on
end
but
he
bore
the
infliction
as
it
was
intended
for
a
caress
angelica
caresses
always
took
some
such
form
she
assured
him
he
would
like
them
in
time
and
he
sincerely
hoped
he
might
but
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
the
following
evening
they
were
again
in
the
drawing
room
together
kilroy
was
reading
the
papers
angelica
was
sitting
with
her
hands
before
her
doing
nothing
not
even
listening
though
she
affected
to
do
so
when
he
read
aloud
such
news
as
he
thought
would
interest
her
the
week
was
nearly
over
and
nothing
more
had
been
said
about
her
return
to
town
she
was
just
wondering
now
if
kilroy
had
found
the
week
a
long
one
she
had
given
him
more
than
enough
of
her
company
and
made
him
feel
at
least
so
she
hoped
slipping
back
to
the
mood
in
which
he
had
found
her
upon
his
arrival
made
him
feel
how
pleasant
a
thing
it
is
to
dwell
alone
in
your
own
house
with
no
one
to
trouble
you
and
she
quite
expected
to
find
when
it
came
to
the
point
that
he
would
cheerfully
take
no
for
an
answer
presently
she
rose
went
to
a
mirror
that
was
let
into
the
wall
and
looked
at
herself
critically
for
some
seconds
should
you
think
it
possible
for
anybody
to
fall
so
hopelessly
in
love
with
my
appearance
that
when
love
was
found
to
be
out
of
the
question
friendship
would
also
be
impossible
she
demanded
in
a
tone
of
contempt
for
herself
turning
half
round
from
the
mirror
to
look
at
kilroy
as
she
spoke
kilroy
glanced
at
her
over
his
that
same
appearance
which
she
disliked
to
be
valued
for
was
a
source
of
pleasure
to
him
but
he
took
good
care
to
conceal
the
fact
on
this
occasion
however
he
fell
into
the
natural
mistake
of
supposing
that
she
was
coquettishly
trying
to
extricate
a
compliment
from
him
for
once
an
amusing
feminine
device
to
which
she
seldom
condescended
well
i
should
think
it
extremely
probable
he
replied
if
he
were
not
already
in
love
with
another
woman
or
an
idea
angelica
suggested
with
a
yawn
and
kilroy
perceiving
that
he
had
somehow
missed
the
point
took
up
his
paper
and
finished
the
paragraph
he
had
been
reading
then
he
said
looking
up
at
her
again
with
admiring
eyes
i
do
not
think
i
quite
like
that
red
frock
of
yours
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
making
you
look
alarmingly
pale
angelica
returned
to
the
mirror
and
once
more
looked
at
herself
deliberately
perhaps
it
does
she
answered
but
at
any
rate
you
shall
not
see
it
again
and
having
spoken
she
sauntered
out
on
to
the
terrace
with
a
listless
step
and
from
thence
she
wandered
off
into
the
gardens
where
the
scent
of
roses
set
her
thinking
thinking
thinking
she
sought
to
change
the
direction
of
her
thoughts
but
vainly
they
would
go
on
in
spite
of
her
and
they
were
always
busy
with
the
same
subject
always
working
at
the
one
idea
israfil
israfil
there
was
nobody
like
him
and
how
badly
she
had
treated
him
and
how
good
he
had
always
been
to
her
and
how
could
she
go
on
day
after
day
like
this
with
no
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
again
in
the
old
delightful
intimate
way
and
oh
if
she
had
not
done
this
and
oh
if
she
had
not
done
that
it
might
all
have
been
so
different
if
only
had
been
different
but
now
how
could
it
come
right
a
hopeless
hopeless
hopeless
case
she
had
lost
his
respect
forever
and
not
to
be
respected
a
woman
and
not
respected
she
went
down
to
the
lodge
gate
where
they
had
parted
and
remembered
the
chill
misery
of
the
moment
the
gray
morning
light
the
pelting
rain
ah
with
a
sudden
pang
she
only
thought
of
it
now
how
wet
he
must
have
been
he
had
lent
her
his
one
umbrella
and
she
had
kept
it
she
had
it
still
she
had
allowed
him
to
walk
back
in
the
rain
without
wrap
or
protection
of
any
kind
and
now
she
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
never
changed
his
things
after
he
had
rescued
her
he
never
did
think
of
himself
the
most
selfless
man
alive
and
she
alas
had
never
thought
of
him
never
considered
his
comfort
in
anything
oh
remorse
if
only
she
could
have
those
times
all
over
again
or
even
one
of
those
times
so
recklessly
misspent
he
might
have
lost
his
life
through
that
wetting
or
what
if
he
lost
his
voice
singers
have
notoriously
delicate
throats
but
happily
nothing
so
untoward
had
resulted
she
was
saved
the
blame
of
a
crowning
disaster
she
knew
because
she
had
heard
of
him
going
to
the
cathedral
as
usual
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
inquire
not
daring
to
go
herself
and
she
had
seen
in
that
day
paper
that
he
would
sing
the
anthem
so
evidently
he
had
not
suffered
which
was
some
comfort
and
yet
how
could
he
go
to
the
cathedral
every
day
and
sing
as
usual
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
it
might
be
fortitude
but
considering
the
circumstances
it
was
far
more
likely
to
be
indifference
and
so
she
continued
to
torment
herself
thinking
always
thinking
without
any
power
to
stop
the
next
day
kilroy
returned
to
town
alone
he
had
only
once
again
alluded
to
his
wish
that
she
should
accompany
him
and
that
he
did
quite
casually
for
she
had
succeeded
in
making
him
content
that
she
should
refuse
she
had
convinced
him
that
her
exuberant
spirits
were
altogether
too
much
for
him
he
had
not
had
an
hour
peace
since
his
arrival
though
the
place
would
have
held
a
regiment
comfortably
and
what
would
it
be
if
he
shut
her
up
in
london
in
a
confined
space
comparatively
speaking
and
against
her
will
too
he
left
by
an
early
afternoon
train
and
she
drove
to
the
station
with
him
to
see
him
off
she
had
enjoyed
his
visit
very
much
so
she
said
especially
the
last
part
of
it
when
she
had
surpassed
herself
in
ingenious
devices
to
exact
attention
all
that
while
it
lasted
really
had
distracted
her
but
the
occupation
was
not
happiness
far
from
it
it
was
a
sort
of
intoxicant
rather
which
made
her
oblivious
for
the
moment
of
her
discontent
at
every
pause
however
remorse
possessed
her
remorse
for
the
past
yet
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
her
present
misdemeanours
would
be
past
in
time
and
might
also
entail
consequences
which
would
in
turn
come
to
be
causes
of
regret
but
now
when
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
kilroy
she
was
sorry
she
stood
on
the
platform
watching
the
train
until
it
was
out
of
sight
and
then
she
returned
to
her
carriage
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
loss
and
pain
what
should
she
do
with
the
rest
of
the
day
she
even
thought
of
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
a
long
vista
of
weary
days
through
which
she
must
live
alone
and
to
no
purpose
a
waste
of
life
a
waste
of
life
a
barren
waste
a
land
of
sand
and
thorns
she
wished
she
was
a
child
again
playing
pranks
with
diavolo
and
she
also
wished
that
she
had
never
played
pranks
since
it
was
so
hard
to
break
herself
of
the
habit
yet
she
enjoyed
them
still
and
assured
herself
that
she
was
only
discontented
now
because
she
had
absolutely
nobody
left
to
torment
then
she
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
to
have
diavolo
with
her
in
her
present
mood
and
instantly
a
squall
of
conflicting
emotions
burst
in
her
breast
angry
emotions
for
the
most
part
because
he
was
no
longer
with
her
in
either
sense
of
the
word
because
he
was
indifferent
to
all
that
concerned
her
inmost
soul
and
was
content
to
live
like
a
lady
himself
a
trivial
idle
life
the
chief
business
of
which
was
pleasure
unremunerative
pleasure
upon
which
he
would
have
had
her
expend
her
highest
faculties
in
return
for
what
admiring
glances
at
herself
and
her
gowns
but
what
should
she
do
with
the
rest
of
the
day
her
handsome
horses
were
prancing
through
morningquest
as
she
asked
herself
the
question
and
there
was
a
little
milliner
on
the
footway
looking
up
with
kindly
envy
at
the
lady
no
older
than
herself
sitting
alone
in
her
splendid
carriage
with
her
coachman
and
footman
and
nothing
to
do
included
very
much
included
being
in
fact
the
principal
item
i
should
be
helping
her
thought
angelica
she
is
overworked
and
weakly
while
i
am
pampered
and
strong
but
there
is
no
rational
way
for
me
to
do
it
if
i
took
her
home
with
me
and
kept
her
in
luxurious
idleness
for
the
rest
of
her
days
as
i
could
very
well
afford
to
do
i
should
only
have
dragged
her
down
from
the
dignity
of
her
own
honest
exertions
into
the
slough
of
in
which
i
find
myself
and
made
bad
worse
should
have
more
and
should
have
less
but
how
to
arrive
at
that
isolated
efforts
seem
to
be
abortive
yet
she
stopped
the
carriage
and
looked
back
the
girl
had
disappeared
she
desired
the
coachman
to
return
and
kept
him
driving
up
and
down
some
time
in
the
hope
of
finding
her
but
the
girl
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
could
they
trace
her
upon
inquiry
another
opportunity
lost
thought
angelica
a
few
pounds
in
her
pocket
would
have
been
a
few
weeks
rest
for
her
a
few
good
meals
a
few
innocent
pleasures
she
would
have
been
strengthened
and
refreshed
and
i
should
have
been
the
better
too
for
the
recollection
of
a
good
deed
done
the
carriage
had
pulled
up
close
to
the
curb
and
the
footman
stood
at
the
door
waiting
for
orders
what
is
there
to
do
thought
angelica
where
shall
i
go
not
home
the
house
is
empty
calls
i
might
as
well
waste
time
in
that
way
as
any
other
she
gave
the
order
and
passed
the
next
two
hours
in
making
calls
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
she
found
herself
within
about
a
mile
of
hamilton
house
and
determined
to
go
and
see
her
mother
there
was
no
real
confidence
between
them
but
lady
adeline
presence
was
soothing
and
angelica
thought
she
would
just
like
to
go
and
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
have
tea
there
and
not
be
worried
to
talk
these
peaceful
intentions
were
frustrated
however
by
the
presence
of
some
visitors
who
were
there
when
she
arrived
and
of
others
who
came
pouring
in
afterward
in
such
numbers
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
neighbourhood
meant
to
call
that
afternoon
was
making
tea
and
talking
as
usual
with
extreme
precision
angelica
found
him
seated
at
a
small
but
solid
black
ebony
table
with
a
massive
silver
before
him
he
folded
his
hands
when
she
entered
and
without
rising
awaited
the
erratic
kiss
which
it
was
her
habit
to
deposit
somewhere
about
his
head
when
she
met
him
which
ceremony
concluded
he
gravely
poured
her
out
a
cup
of
tea
with
sugar
milk
but
cream
as
he
observed
and
then
he
peeped
into
the
teapot
and
proceeded
to
fill
it
up
from
the
great
urn
which
was
bubbling
and
boiling
in
front
of
him
he
always
made
tea
in
his
own
house
it
was
a
fad
of
his
and
the
more
people
he
had
to
make
it
for
the
better
pleased
he
was
a
servant
was
stationed
at
his
elbow
whose
duty
it
was
to
place
the
cups
as
his
master
filled
them
on
a
silver
salver
held
by
another
servant
who
took
them
to
offer
to
the
visitors
who
were
seated
about
the
room
angelica
knew
the
ceremony
well
and
slipped
away
into
a
corner
as
soon
as
she
could
escape
from
her
father
punctilious
inquiries
about
her
own
health
and
her
husband
and
there
she
became
wedged
by
degrees
as
the
room
grew
gradually
crowded
beside
her
was
a
mirror
in
which
she
could
see
all
who
arrived
and
all
that
happened
and
involuntarily
she
became
a
silent
spectator
the
medium
of
the
mirror
imparting
a
curious
unreality
to
the
scene
which
invested
it
with
all
the
charm
of
a
dream
and
as
in
a
dream
she
looked
and
listened
while
clearly
beneath
the
main
current
of
conversation
and
unbroken
by
the
restless
change
and
motion
of
the
people
her
own
thoughts
flowed
on
consciously
and
continuously
half
turned
from
the
rest
of
the
room
she
sat
at
a
table
listlessly
turning
the
leaves
of
an
album
at
which
she
glanced
when
she
was
not
looking
into
the
mirror
she
saw
the
party
from
morne
enter
the
room
aunt
fulda
and
her
eternal
calm
she
looked
just
the
same
in
the
at
morningquest
that
unlucky
night
when
the
tenor
met
the
boy
she
was
always
the
same
is
it
human
to
be
always
the
same
who
is
that
lady
angelica
heard
a
girl
ask
of
a
benevolent
looking
elderly
clergyman
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
her
oh
that
is
lady
fulda
guthrie
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
duke
of
morningquest
he
replied
is
a
roman
catholic
a
pervert
as
we
say
but
still
a
very
noble
woman
religious
too
in
spite
of
the
errors
of
rome
one
must
confess
it
a
pity
she
ever
left
us
a
great
pity
but
of
course
loss
as
well
as
ours
we
require
such
women
now
though
but
somehow
we
do
not
keep
them
and
i
can
not
think
why
too
cold
angelica
thoughts
ran
on
hollow
shallow
inconsistent
loveless
catholicism
equals
a
modern
refinement
of
pagan
principles
with
all
the
old
deities
on
their
best
behaviour
thrown
in
while
protestantism
is
an
ecclesiastical
system
founded
on
fetish
you
are
a
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
the
benevolent
old
clergyman
was
saying
only
on
a
visit
ah
then
of
course
you
do
know
they
are
a
remarkable
family
somewhat
eccentric
ideala
as
they
call
her
is
no
relation
only
an
intimate
friend
of
lady
claudia
beaumont
and
of
the
marquis
of
dawne
the
three
are
usually
together
the
new
order
is
an
outcome
of
their
ideas
a
sort
of
feminine
so
well
as
i
can
make
out
but
no
good
can
come
out
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
i
trust
as
you
are
a
very
young
lady
not
so
young
i
am
indeed
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
i
should
not
have
thought
you
more
than
nineteen
but
is
not
a
great
age
either
and
i
do
hope
you
will
not
be
drawn
into
that
set
they
are
sadly
misguided
the
ladies
scoff
at
the
wisdom
of
men
look
for
inconsistencies
and
at
them
actually
it
is
very
bad
taste
you
know
and
they
call
it
an
impertinence
for
us
to
presume
to
legislate
exclusively
in
matters
which
specially
concern
their
sex
and
also
object
to
the
interference
of
the
church
as
being
a
distinctly
masculine
organization
in
the
regulation
of
their
lives
men
they
declare
have
always
said
that
they
do
not
understand
women
and
it
is
of
course
the
height
of
folly
for
them
to
presume
to
express
opinions
upon
a
subject
they
do
not
understand
now
can
anything
be
more
absurd
and
it
is
dangerous
besides
absolutely
dangerous
yet
i
hear
that
they
are
very
good
women
the
girl
ventured
and
angelica
thought
that
she
detected
a
note
of
derision
levelled
at
the
clerical
exponent
of
these
reprehensible
ideas
beneath
the
demure
remark
oh
saintlike
he
answered
cordially
but
still
to
blame
misguided
you
know
so
i
venture
to
warn
you
how
can
they
presume
to
reject
proper
direction
their
pride
is
excessive
but
the
church
will
receive
them
and
extend
her
benefits
to
them
still
if
only
they
will
humble
themselves
conversation
over
the
room
entered
upon
a
passage
at
this
moment
and
angelica
lost
the
rest
of
the
sentence
in
the
general
outburst
a
new
voice
presently
claimed
her
attention
the
speaker
was
a
young
man
addressing
another
young
man
and
both
had
their
backs
turned
to
her
and
were
looking
hard
at
a
portrait
of
herself
hung
so
low
on
the
wall
that
they
had
to
stoop
to
look
into
it
painted
by
a
good
man
were
the
first
words
she
heard
rather
fine
face
who
is
it
daughter
of
the
house
do
you
know
old
duke
granddaughter
married
old
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
ah
then
that
was
done
some
time
ago
i
expect
oh
dear
no
only
last
year
it
was
exhibited
in
the
last
academy
then
she
still
young
he
peered
into
the
portrait
once
more
with
an
evident
increase
of
interest
she
looks
as
if
she
might
be
larky
ca
make
her
out
on
my
word
was
the
response
delivered
in
a
tone
of
strong
disapproval
married
to
an
elderly
chap
not
old
exactly
but
a
good
twenty
years
older
than
herself
who
gives
her
her
head
to
an
unlimited
extent
yet
she
says
she
does
care
to
have
a
lot
of
men
bothering
about
and
by
jove
she
acts
as
if
she
meant
it
it
beastly
unnatural
you
know
well
i
must
say
i
like
a
woman
to
be
a
woman
the
other
rejoined
surveying
the
portrait
from
this
new
point
of
view
but
that
the
way
with
all
that
guthrie
lot
and
you
know
dawne
himself
is
so
what
can
you
expect
of
the
rest
the
tone
implied
suddenly
angelica
felt
her
face
flush
one
of
her
ungovernable
fits
of
fury
was
upon
her
she
sprang
to
her
feet
upsetting
her
chair
with
a
crash
and
turned
upon
the
two
young
men
who
recognizing
her
changed
colour
and
countenance
and
shrank
back
apologetically
her
uncle
seeing
something
wrong
had
hurried
across
the
room
to
her
with
anxious
eyes
who
are
those
people
she
asked
him
indicating
the
two
young
men
lord
dawne
always
all
courtesy
and
consideration
himself
was
shocked
by
her
tone
i
think
you
have
met
captain
leicester
before
he
gravely
reminded
her
let
me
introduce
no
for
heaven
sake
angelica
broke
forth
glaring
angrily
at
the
offenders
she
walked
away
abruptly
with
the
words
on
her
lips
leaving
lord
dawne
to
settle
with
the
delinquents
as
he
thought
fit
her
mother
who
was
seated
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
talking
to
a
old
lady
angelica
did
not
know
stretched
out
a
hand
to
her
as
she
approached
and
drew
her
to
a
seat
beside
her
and
instantly
angelica
felt
herself
in
another
moral
atmosphere
this
is
my
daughter
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
lady
adeline
said
to
the
old
lady
then
added
smiling
there
are
so
many
kilroys
in
this
neighbourhood
one
is
obliged
to
specify
angelica
dear
mrs
power
angelica
bowed
and
then
leaned
back
in
her
chair
so
that
she
might
not
have
to
join
in
the
conversation
but
she
listened
in
an
absent
sort
of
way
feeling
soothed
the
while
by
the
tone
of
refinement
of
earnestness
and
sincerity
in
which
every
word
was
uttered
no
i
am
sure
lady
adeline
was
saying
i
am
sure
no
one
who
can
judge
would
mistake
that
lineless
calm
for
a
device
to
cover
all
emotion
i
never
have
done
so
myself
power
rejoined
although
i
do
not
know
her
history
but
i
should
say
judging
merely
from
observation
that
the
fineness
of
her
countenance
which
consists
more
in
the
expression
of
it
than
in
either
form
or
feature
though
both
are
good
is
the
result
of
long
and
stern
discipline
the
evidence
of
a
true
and
beautiful
soul
and
of
a
noble
mind
at
rest
after
some
heavy
sorrow
or
some
great
temptation
which
being
resisted
has
proved
a
blessing
and
a
source
of
strength
angelica
wondered
of
whom
they
were
speaking
and
following
the
direction
of
their
eyes
met
those
of
ideala
fixed
a
little
sadly
a
little
wistfully
upon
herself
young
people
as
they
grow
up
find
their
own
life
history
so
absorbingly
interesting
that
they
think
little
of
what
may
have
happened
or
may
be
happening
to
those
whom
they
have
always
known
as
grown
up
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
angelica
that
any
one
of
the
placid
women
among
whom
she
had
always
lived
in
contrast
to
them
herself
as
a
comet
is
to
the
fixed
stars
had
ever
experienced
any
extremes
of
emotion
now
however
she
felt
as
if
her
eyes
had
been
suddenly
opened
and
she
looked
with
a
new
interest
at
her
old
familiar
friends
and
wondered
her
mind
busy
for
the
moment
with
what
she
had
just
heard
she
could
not
keep
it
there
however
involuntarily
it
slipped
away
back
back
to
that
first
attempt
of
hers
to
see
the
hidden
wheels
of
life
go
round
the
the
tenor
suddenly
she
felt
as
if
she
must
suffocate
if
she
did
not
get
out
into
the
air
and
rising
quickly
she
stole
from
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
unobserved
but
the
babble
of
voices
seemed
to
pursue
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
steps
and
felt
as
if
the
people
were
all
preparing
to
stream
out
of
the
drawing
room
after
her
to
surround
her
and
keep
up
the
distracting
buzz
in
her
ears
by
their
idle
inconsequent
talk
their
horses
were
prancing
about
the
drive
their
empty
carriages
with
cushions
awry
and
wraps
flung
untidily
down
on
the
seats
or
even
hanging
over
the
doors
and
grazing
the
dusty
wheels
gave
her
a
sense
of
disorder
and
discomfort
from
which
she
felt
she
must
fly
where
to
please
the
footman
asked
touching
his
hat
when
he
had
closed
the
door
fountain
towers
angelica
answered
she
would
go
and
see
galbraith
when
the
carriage
drew
up
under
the
porch
at
fountain
towers
she
sat
some
time
as
if
unaware
of
the
fact
but
the
footman
patient
face
as
he
waited
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
ready
to
help
her
to
descend
recalled
her
she
walked
into
the
house
as
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
do
and
instantly
thoughts
of
diavolo
came
crowding
why
had
diavolo
ceased
to
be
all
in
all
to
her
she
asked
herself
the
question
through
a
mist
of
tears
which
gathered
in
her
eyes
but
did
not
fall
and
at
the
same
moment
her
busy
mind
took
note
of
the
singular
appearance
of
a
statue
on
the
staircase
as
she
beheld
it
in
blurred
outline
through
her
bedimmed
vision
she
found
galbraith
in
the
library
sitting
at
his
writing
table
the
door
was
half
open
so
she
entered
without
knocking
and
walked
up
to
him
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
step
rose
smiling
and
held
out
his
hand
when
he
saw
who
it
was
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
this
afternoon
he
remarked
sit
down
but
before
she
had
settled
herself
his
practised
eyes
had
detected
something
wrong
what
is
it
he
asked
nerves
she
answered
give
me
something
he
went
to
an
inner
room
and
returned
presently
with
a
colourless
draught
in
a
medicine
glass
she
took
it
from
him
and
drank
it
mechanically
and
then
he
placed
a
cushion
for
her
and
she
leant
back
in
the
deep
armchair
and
closed
her
eyes
galbraith
looked
at
her
for
a
few
seconds
seriously
and
then
returned
to
his
writing
presently
lord
dawne
came
in
and
raised
his
eyebrows
inquiringly
when
he
saw
angelica
who
seemed
to
be
asleep
overwrought
galbraith
replied
to
the
silent
inquiry
there
was
a
at
hamilton
house
just
now
her
uncle
observed
but
how
is
all
this
going
to
end
well
of
course
but
you
had
better
leave
her
to
me
lord
dawne
quietly
withdrew
oh
the
blessed
rest
and
peace
of
this
place
angelica
exclaimed
shortly
afterward
galbraith
who
had
resumed
his
writing
put
down
his
pen
again
and
turned
to
her
talk
to
me
she
said
i
lost
my
i
lost
heart
i
a
worthless
person
how
am
i
to
get
out
of
this
dreadful
groove
live
for
others
live
openly
he
answered
slowly
looking
up
beyond
her
into
futurity
with
a
kindly
light
in
his
deep
gray
eyes
a
something
of
hope
of
confidence
of
encouragement
expressed
in
his
strong
plain
face
angelica
bowed
her
head
the
familiar
phrases
had
a
new
significance
now
and
diverted
the
stream
of
her
reflections
into
another
channel
she
folded
her
hands
on
her
lap
and
sat
motionless
once
more
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
galbraith
was
a
specialist
in
mental
maladies
he
knew
exactly
how
much
to
say
and
when
to
say
it
if
a
text
were
as
much
as
the
patient
required
or
could
bear
he
never
made
the
mistake
of
preaching
a
sermon
upon
it
in
addition
and
so
for
the
third
time
he
took
up
his
pen
and
returned
to
his
work
leaving
angelica
engaged
in
sober
thought
and
happily
quiescent
chapter
iii
it
was
late
when
at
last
she
went
home
but
the
drive
of
many
miles
in
the
fresh
evening
air
helped
to
revive
her
she
had
dreaded
the
return
the
place
seemed
empty
to
her
imagination
and
strange
and
chill
as
a
south
room
in
which
we
have
sat
and
been
glad
with
friends
all
the
bright
morning
does
if
by
chance
we
return
alone
when
the
sun
has
departed
and
the
place
was
dismal
there
was
no
one
to
welcome
her
even
her
servants
were
out
of
the
way
for
once
and
she
felt
her
heart
sink
as
she
crossed
the
deserted
hall
to
go
upstairs
and
saw
long
lines
of
doors
shut
for
the
most
part
or
if
open
showing
big
rooms
beyond
silent
and
tenantless
as
she
passed
the
library
she
had
noticed
her
husband
chair
half
turned
from
his
writing
table
just
as
he
had
left
it
probably
that
very
morning
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
then
he
must
have
come
to
his
journey
end
ages
ago
she
wondered
if
he
had
felt
it
as
dreary
on
arriving
as
she
did
now
and
an
unaccustomed
wish
to
be
with
him
in
order
to
make
things
pleasanter
for
him
here
obtruded
itself
it
was
one
of
the
least
selfish
thoughts
she
had
had
lately
and
this
was
also
one
of
the
very
few
occasions
on
which
his
leaving
her
had
not
occasioned
her
a
sense
of
liberty
restored
which
was
the
one
unmixed
delight
she
had
hitherto
experienced
her
mind
was
racked
by
inconsistencies
but
she
did
not
perceive
it
herself
otherwise
she
must
also
have
observed
that
she
was
running
up
the
whole
gamut
of
her
past
moods
and
experiences
only
to
find
how
unsatisfactory
in
its
unstableness
and
futility
was
each
and
she
might
still
further
have
perceived
how
fatal
the
habit
of
living
from
day
to
day
without
any
settled
purpose
a
mere
cork
of
a
creature
on
the
waters
of
life
at
the
mercy
of
every
current
of
impulse
is
to
that
permanent
content
to
which
a
steady
effort
to
do
right
at
all
events
whatever
else
we
may
not
do
and
right
only
whatever
happens
alone
gives
rise
making
thereof
a
sure
foundation
of
quiet
happiness
out
of
which
countless
pleasures
known
only
to
those
who
possess
it
spring
perceptibly
or
to
which
they
come
like
butterflies
to
summer
flowers
enriching
them
with
their
beauty
and
vitality
while
they
stay
and
leaving
them
none
the
poorer
when
they
depart
but
rather
it
may
be
gainers
by
the
fertilizing
memories
which
remain
angelica
had
gone
to
her
room
to
dress
for
the
evening
as
usual
she
had
no
idea
of
shirking
the
ordinary
routine
of
daily
life
because
her
mind
was
perturbed
but
that
duty
over
she
descended
to
the
drawing
room
to
wait
until
dinner
should
be
announced
and
so
found
herself
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
once
more
she
went
to
one
of
the
fireplaces
and
stood
with
her
hands
folded
on
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
and
her
forehead
resting
on
them
looking
down
at
the
flowers
and
foliage
plants
which
concealed
the
grate
you
can
not
go
on
like
this
you
know
she
mentally
ejaculated
apostrophising
herself
then
she
became
conscious
of
a
great
sense
of
loneliness
the
kind
of
loneliness
of
the
heart
from
which
there
is
no
escape
except
in
the
presence
of
one
who
knows
what
the
trouble
is
and
can
sympathize
she
had
been
half
inclined
to
confide
in
galbraith
and
now
she
regretted
she
had
not
but
presently
passing
into
a
contrary
mood
she
was
glad
what
good
could
he
have
done
and
as
for
her
husband
an
empty
house
was
better
than
a
bad
tenant
this
was
before
dinner
was
announced
but
afterward
at
dinner
sitting
in
solitary
state
with
the
servants
behind
her
and
a
book
to
keep
her
in
countenance
she
made
a
grievance
of
his
absence
and
then
sighed
for
such
company
as
the
seven
more
who
were
entertained
in
that
house
which
was
swept
and
garnished
for
another
purpose
she
fancied
but
she
could
not
recollect
what
and
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
try
so
her
thoughts
rambled
on
uncontrolled
only
she
believed
they
were
merry
and
that
was
what
she
was
not
but
she
would
be
very
soon
in
spite
of
everything
in
pursuance
of
which
resolve
she
wrote
several
notes
after
dinner
asking
people
she
knew
well
enough
to
kindly
dispense
with
the
ceremony
of
a
long
invitation
and
come
and
lunch
with
her
and
she
dispatched
a
groom
on
horseback
with
the
notes
that
there
might
be
no
delay
she
even
thought
of
making
up
a
house
party
but
here
her
interest
and
energy
flagged
and
she
left
the
execution
of
that
project
till
next
day
then
she
relapsed
into
her
regretful
discontented
mood
if
only
if
only
that
wretched
accident
had
never
occurred
how
different
would
her
feelings
have
been
at
this
moment
was
one
of
her
reflections
as
she
sat
alone
on
the
terrace
outside
the
great
deserted
reception
rooms
she
would
have
been
waiting
now
till
the
house
was
quiet
and
then
she
would
have
dashed
up
to
her
room
to
dress
with
that
exquisite
sense
of
freedom
which
made
the
whole
delight
of
the
thing
and
in
half
an
hour
she
might
have
been
the
with
israfil
you
can
not
go
on
like
this
you
know
angelica
repeated
to
herself
you
must
do
something
but
what
involuntarily
her
mind
returned
to
the
tenor
if
she
could
win
his
respect
she
felt
she
could
start
afresh
with
a
clear
conscience
and
a
steadfast
determination
to
what
was
it
galbraith
had
suggested
live
openly
live
for
others
but
how
to
win
the
tenor
back
to
tolerate
her
if
she
would
make
him
her
friend
she
knew
that
she
must
be
entirely
true
in
thought
word
and
deed
to
every
duty
to
every
principle
of
right
and
how
could
she
be
that
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
theory
of
hereditary
predisposition
coming
as
she
did
of
a
race
foredoomed
apparently
to
the
opposite
course
it
was
folly
to
contend
with
fate
when
fate
took
the
form
of
a
long
line
of
ancestors
who
had
made
a
family
commandment
for
themselves
which
was
be
decent
to
all
seeming
but
sin
all
the
same
to
your
heart
content
and
had
kept
it
courageously
at
least
the
men
had
but
then
the
women
had
been
worthy
in
which
thought
she
suddenly
perceived
that
there
was
food
for
reflection
for
was
not
this
contradictious
fact
a
proof
that
it
was
a
good
deal
a
matter
of
choice
after
all
and
here
the
tenor
parting
words
recurred
to
her
and
with
them
came
the
recollection
of
the
impression
made
at
the
moment
by
the
deep
yet
diffident
tone
of
earnest
conviction
in
which
he
had
uttered
that
last
assurance
you
will
do
some
good
in
the
world
you
will
be
a
good
woman
yet
i
know
i
know
you
will
should
she
was
the
question
she
now
asked
herself
were
the
words
prophetic
she
wondered
and
from
that
moment
her
thoughts
took
a
new
departure
and
she
was
able
as
it
were
to
stand
aloof
and
look
back
at
herself
as
she
had
been
and
forward
to
herself
as
she
might
yet
become
in
this
quiet
hour
of
retrospect
she
was
quite
ready
to
confess
her
sins
she
was
sincerely
sorry
she
had
deceived
the
tenor
but
why
was
she
sorry
why
simply
because
he
had
found
her
out
simply
because
there
was
an
end
of
a
charming
adventure
though
less
on
that
account
than
on
others
for
of
course
she
knew
that
the
end
was
near
that
they
must
have
parted
soon
in
any
case
it
was
the
manner
of
the
parting
that
caused
her
such
regret
she
had
lost
his
affection
lost
his
confidence
lost
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
she
supposed
which
was
more
than
she
could
bear
if
he
met
her
in
the
street
he
would
probably
look
the
other
way
would
he
oh
the
very
notion
stung
her
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
threw
up
her
hands
and
then
as
if
goaded
by
a
lash
but
without
any
distinct
idea
she
ran
down
the
steps
headlong
into
the
garden
and
so
on
through
the
park
till
she
came
to
the
river
when
she
got
there
she
stopped
at
the
landing
place
not
knowing
why
she
had
come
and
as
she
stood
there
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
the
absence
of
some
familiar
object
forced
itself
upon
her
attention
her
boat
it
must
have
been
lost
the
night
of
the
accident
she
did
not
know
whether
it
had
sunk
or
not
but
there
was
no
name
on
it
so
that
even
if
it
had
been
found
it
could
not
have
been
restored
to
her
unless
she
had
claimed
it
and
while
she
thought
this
she
was
conscious
of
another
pang
of
regret
she
knew
that
had
the
boat
been
there
her
next
impulse
would
have
been
to
go
to
the
tenor
just
as
she
was
bareheaded
and
in
her
thin
evening
dress
with
what
object
though
to
beg
for
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
she
supposed
but
alas
she
could
not
sneer
in
earnest
or
laugh
in
earnest
at
any
absurdity
she
chose
to
think
there
was
in
the
idea
for
she
acknowledged
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
knew
that
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
man
an
honour
especially
to
her
as
she
humbly
insisted
although
she
had
not
broken
any
of
the
commandments
and
never
would
and
never
could
slowly
she
returned
to
the
house
a
servant
met
her
on
the
terrace
and
asked
her
if
she
should
require
anything
more
that
night
then
she
discovered
the
lateness
of
the
hour
ordered
the
household
to
bed
and
retired
to
her
own
room
there
she
extinguished
the
lights
threw
the
windows
wider
open
and
sat
looking
out
into
the
dim
mysterious
night
angelica
loved
the
night
no
matter
what
her
mood
might
be
she
felt
its
charm
and
something
also
of
the
hallowed
influence
which
is
peculiarly
its
own
and
now
as
she
leant
looking
out
all
the
beauty
of
it
and
its
heavenly
purity
began
to
steal
into
her
heart
and
to
soften
it
slowly
as
the
tide
goes
out
when
the
sea
is
tempestuous
the
waves
returning
again
and
again
with
angry
burst
and
flow
to
cover
the
same
spot
as
if
loath
to
leave
it
but
receding
inevitably
till
in
the
further
distance
their
harsh
impetuous
roar
sinks
to
a
babble
when
heard
from
the
place
where
they
lately
raged
which
itself
seems
the
safer
for
the
contrast
between
the
now
of
quiet
and
firmness
and
the
then
of
shifting
sand
and
watery
fury
so
it
was
with
angelica
turmoil
of
mind
the
foaming
discontent
the
battling
projects
by
slow
degrees
they
all
subsided
and
after
the
storm
of
uncertainty
there
came
something
like
the
calm
of
a
settled
purpose
to
be
good
to
ascend
to
the
higher
life
if
that
meant
to
feel
like
this
always
she
would
be
good
if
in
her
lay
such
power
she
could
not
be
wholly
without
religion
because
she
found
in
herself
a
reverence
for
what
was
religion
in
others
and
what
after
all
is
religion
an
attitude
of
the
mind
which
develops
in
us
the
power
to
love
reverence
and
practise
all
that
constitutes
moral
probity
but
how
to
attain
to
this
by
trying
and
trusting
faith
that
was
it
faith
in
the
power
of
goodness
upon
the
recognition
of
this
simple
truth
her
spirit
wings
unfurled
and
slowly
as
her
senses
ceased
to
be
importunate
she
became
possessed
by
some
idea
of
deathless
love
and
longing
which
fired
her
soul
with
its
heroism
and
filled
her
heart
with
its
pathos
until
both
mind
and
hands
together
unconsciously
assumed
the
attitude
of
prayer
she
did
not
go
to
bed
at
all
that
night
but
just
sat
there
by
the
open
window
patiently
waiting
for
the
dawn
nor
did
she
feel
the
time
long
her
whole
being
thrilled
to
this
new
sensation
and
was
subdued
by
it
so
that
she
remained
motionless
and
rapturously
absorbed
it
might
only
last
till
daybreak
but
while
it
did
last
it
was
certainly
intense
it
lasted
longer
than
that
however
it
even
survived
the
day
and
the
luncheon
party
to
which
she
had
in
a
rash
moment
invited
her
friends
she
had
determined
to
go
to
the
tenor
that
very
afternoon
in
the
way
her
husband
had
suggested
at
first
she
thought
she
would
drive
but
it
was
a
long
way
round
by
the
road
much
longer
than
by
the
river
and
so
she
decided
to
walk
although
the
weather
was
inclined
to
be
tempestuous
she
crossed
by
the
ferry
thinking
she
would
if
possible
meet
the
tenor
as
he
came
away
from
the
afternoon
service
in
that
hope
however
she
was
disappointed
for
when
she
got
to
the
cathedral
she
found
the
service
over
the
congregation
dispersed
and
the
doors
locked
there
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
go
to
his
own
house
with
a
fast
beating
heart
she
crossed
the
road
and
paused
at
the
little
gate
she
felt
now
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
should
have
taken
her
husband
advice
and
come
in
state
she
would
not
have
felt
half
so
frightened
and
awkward
if
she
could
have
sat
in
her
carriage
and
sent
the
footman
to
inquire
if
the
tenor
would
do
her
the
favour
to
allow
her
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
and
what
would
he
say
to
her
now
and
what
should
she
say
suppose
he
refused
to
see
her
at
all
should
she
ever
survive
it
could
she
take
him
by
storm
as
the
boy
would
have
done
and
demand
his
friendship
and
kind
consideration
as
a
right
oh
for
some
of
the
unblushing
assurance
which
had
distinguished
the
boy
it
must
have
been
part
of
the
costume
but
surely
her
confidence
would
return
at
the
right
moment
and
then
she
would
be
able
to
face
him
boldly
having
to
knock
at
the
door
and
ask
for
him
was
like
the
first
plunge
into
cold
water
just
to
think
of
it
took
her
breath
away
but
the
window
was
doubtless
unfastened
as
usual
should
she
go
in
by
that
no
it
was
absurd
though
how
she
hesitated
especially
after
all
that
had
happened
but
be
deterred
by
this
most
novel
and
uncomfortable
shyness
she
would
not
she
had
come
so
far
and
it
should
not
be
for
nothing
she
would
not
go
back
until
but
now
at
last
with
a
smile
at
her
qualms
and
nervous
tremors
she
knocked
resolutely
there
was
a
little
interval
before
the
knock
was
answered
and
she
filled
it
with
hope
she
knew
just
how
radiant
she
would
feel
as
she
came
away
successful
she
experienced
something
of
the
relief
and
pleasure
which
should
follow
upon
this
pain
and
then
the
door
was
opened
by
the
tenor
elderly
housekeeper
the
woman
had
that
worn
and
worried
look
upon
her
face
which
is
common
among
women
of
her
class
is
your
master
at
home
angelica
asked
not
recollecting
for
the
moment
by
what
name
he
was
known
the
woman
looked
at
her
curiously
as
if
to
determine
her
social
status
before
she
committed
herself
the
question
seemed
to
surprise
her
he
gone
she
answered
dolefully
did
you
know
gone
angelica
echoed
blankly
where
gone
home
the
woman
answered
gone
home
angelica
exclaimed
unable
to
conceal
her
dismay
he
has
no
home
but
this
where
is
his
home
the
woman
gave
her
another
curious
look
took
a
moment
to
choose
her
words
then
blurted
out
he
dead
miss
did
you
know
and
buried

chapter
iv
the
lonely
man
after
leaving
angelica
that
night
had
returned
to
the
close
walking
like
one
that
hath
aweary
dream
when
he
entered
his
little
house
and
the
sitting
room
where
the
lamp
was
still
burning
its
yellow
light
in
sickly
contrast
to
the
pale
twilight
of
the
summer
dawn
which
was
beginning
to
brighten
by
that
time
the
discomfort
consequent
on
disorder
struck
a
chill
to
his
heart
the
roses
still
lay
scattered
about
the
floor
but
they
had
been
trampled
under
foot
and
their
beauty
had
suffered
their
freshness
was
marred
and
their
perfume
rising
acrid
from
bruised
petals
greeted
him
unwholesomely
after
the
fresh
morning
air
and
rendered
the
atmosphere
faint
and
oppressive
the
stand
with
the
flower
pots
much
disarranged
stood
as
he
had
left
it
when
he
pulled
it
roughly
aside
to
get
at
the
grate
and
the
fire
had
burnt
out
leaving
blackened
embers
to
add
to
the
general
air
of
dreariness
and
desertion
angelica
violin
lay
under
the
grand
piano
where
he
had
heedlessly
flung
it
when
he
loosed
it
from
her
rigid
grasp
and
there
were
pipes
and
glasses
and
bottles
about
chairs
upset
and
displaced
books
and
papers
music
and
magazines
piled
up
in
heaps
untidily
to
be
out
of
the
way
all
the
usual
signs
to
sum
up
which
suggest
that
a
room
has
been
used
over
night
for
some
unaccustomed
purpose
convivial
or
the
reverse
a
condition
known
only
to
the
early
maid
as
a
rule
and
therefore
acting
with
peculiarly
dismal
effect
upon
the
chance
observer
but
more
dismal
now
to
the
weary
tenor
than
any
room
he
had
ever
seen
under
similar
circumstances
by
reason
of
the
associations
that
clung
about
it
he
opened
the
window
wide
extinguished
the
lamp
and
began
mechanically
to
put
things
away
and
arrange
the
chairs
the
habit
of
doing
much
for
himself
prompted
all
this
anything
that
was
not
a
matter
of
habit
he
never
thought
of
doing
his
things
were
drying
on
him
and
he
had
forgotten
that
they
had
ever
been
wet
he
had
forgotten
too
that
the
night
was
past
and
over
he
was
heart
sick
and
weary
yet
did
not
feel
that
there
was
any
need
of
rest
the
extraordinary
lucidity
of
mind
of
which
he
had
been
conscious
while
his
much
loved
boy
was
in
danger
had
left
him
now
and
only
a
blurred
recollection
as
of
many
incidents
crowding
thickly
upon
each
other
without
order
or
sequence
recurred
to
him
he
suffered
from
a
sense
of
loss
from
an
overpowering
grief
the
kind
of
grief
which
is
all
the
worse
to
bear
because
it
has
not
come
in
the
course
of
nature
but
by
the
fault
of
man
a
something
that
might
have
been
helped
as
when
a
friend
is
killed
by
accident
or
lost
to
us
otherwise
than
by
death
the
consequence
of
disease
but
one
persistent
thought
beset
him
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
exhausting
him
by
dint
of
forced
reiteration
the
girl
he
had
been
idolizing
well
there
was
no
such
person
and
there
never
had
been
that
was
all
yet
what
an
in
the
first
moment
of
the
terrible
calamity
that
had
befallen
him
it
seemed
now
that
there
could
have
been
nothing
like
the
misery
of
this
home
returning
the
barren
black
despair
of
it
it
was
the
hopeless
difference
between
pain
and
paralysis
then
he
had
suffered
but
at
least
he
could
feel
now
he
felt
nothing
except
that
all
feeling
was
over
when
he
had
finished
the
simple
arrangement
of
his
room
he
still
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
shaking
back
his
yellow
hair
and
brushing
his
hand
up
over
it
as
if
the
gesture
eased
the
trouble
of
his
mind
if
even
the
boy
had
been
left
me
he
thought
and
it
was
the
one
distinct
regret
he
formulated
after
a
while
his
housekeeper
arrived
a
pleasant
elderly
woman
who
had
attended
him
ever
since
he
came
to
morningquest
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
let
any
personal
matter
whether
it
were
pain
or
pleasure
affect
the
temper
of
his
intercourse
with
those
about
him
and
the
force
of
habit
helped
him
now
again
to
rouse
himself
and
greet
the
woman
in
his
usual
kindly
courteous
way
so
that
being
unobservant
she
noticed
no
change
in
him
except
that
he
was
up
earlier
than
usual
but
then
he
was
always
an
early
riser
she
therefore
set
about
her
work
unsuspiciously
and
presently
drove
him
out
of
the
sitting
room
with
her
and
brush
and
he
went
upstairs
there
happening
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
own
haggard
face
and
discreditable
flannels
in
the
mirror
he
began
to
change
mechanically
and
dressed
himself
with
all
his
habitual
neatness
and
precision
then
a
little
choir
boy
came
to
be
helped
with
his
music
it
was
the
one
who
sang
the
soprano
solos
in
the
cathedral
a
boy
with
a
lovely
voice
and
much
general
as
well
as
musical
ability
both
of
which
the
tenor
laboured
to
help
him
to
develop
he
came
every
morning
for
lessons
and
the
tenor
gave
him
these
and
such
a
breakfast
also
as
a
small
boy
loves
but
the
little
fellow
to
do
him
justice
cared
more
for
the
tenor
than
the
breakfast
there
were
three
services
in
the
cathedral
that
day
and
the
tenor
went
to
each
but
he
did
not
sing
he
seemed
to
have
taken
cold
and
was
hoarse
with
a
slight
cough
and
a
peculiar
little
stab
in
his
chest
and
catching
of
the
breath
which
however
did
not
trouble
him
much
to
begin
with
but
as
the
day
advanced
every
bone
in
his
body
ached
with
a
dull
wearying
pain
and
he
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
early
once
there
the
sense
of
fatigue
was
overpowering
yet
he
could
not
sleep
until
long
past
midnight
when
he
dropped
off
quite
suddenly
or
rather
as
it
seemed
to
him
when
all
at
once
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
river
to
rescue
the
boy
and
began
to
go
down
down
down
to
a
depth
the
weight
of
the
water
above
him
becoming
greater
and
greater
till
the
pressure
was
unbearable
and
a
horrid
sense
of
suffocation
increasing
every
instant
impelled
him
to
struggle
to
the
surface
but
vainly
he
could
not
rise
and
down
down
he
continued
to
descend
reaching
no
bottom
yet
dropping
at
last
before
he
could
help
himself
on
a
sharp
stake
pointed
like
a
dagger
that
ran
right
through
his
chest
the
pain
aroused
him
with
a
great
start
but
the
impression
had
been
so
vivid
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
shake
off
the
sensation
of
descending
with
icy
water
about
him
and
even
when
he
was
wide
awake
and
although
he
was
bathed
in
perspiration
the
feeling
of
cold
remained
and
so
did
the
pain
it
was
during
that
night
that
the
weather
changed
the
next
day
it
was
blowing
a
gale
heavy
showers
began
to
fall
at
intervals
chilling
the
atmosphere
and
finally
settled
into
a
steady
downpour
such
as
frequently
occurs
in
the
middle
of
summer
making
everything
indoors
humid
and
unwholesome
and
causing
colds
and
sore
throats
and
other
unseasonable
complaints
the
tenor
taught
his
little
choir
boy
as
usual
in
the
morning
went
to
the
three
services
getting
more
or
less
wet
each
time
and
then
came
home
and
tried
to
do
some
work
but
was
not
equal
to
it
his
head
ached
then
tried
to
smoke
but
the
pipe
nauseated
him
and
finally
resigned
himself
to
idleness
and
just
sat
still
in
his
lonely
room
lonely
of
heart
himself
yet
with
his
hands
patiently
folded
dreamily
watching
the
rain
as
it
beat
upon
the
old
cathedral
opposite
and
streamed
from
eave
and
gargoyle
and
splashed
from
the
narrow
spouting
under
the
roof
making
spreading
pathways
of
dark
moisture
for
itself
on
the
gray
stone
walls
wherever
it
overflowed
it
was
all
his
will
to
the
tenor
and
for
his
sake
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
have
borne
heroically
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
his
cough
was
much
worse
that
day
the
pain
in
his
chest
was
more
acute
and
his
temperature
rose
higher
and
higher
yet
he
did
not
complain
he
knew
he
was
suffering
from
something
serious
now
but
he
derived
from
his
perfect
faith
in
the
beneficence
of
the
power
that
orders
all
things
an
almost
superhuman
fortitude
but
as
he
sat
there
with
his
hands
folded
his
mind
busy
with
many
things
returned
inevitably
to
the
old
weary
theme
just
as
at
the
same
time
angelica
own
was
doing
but
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
always
after
a
startling
event
those
who
have
been
present
as
spectators
or
taken
some
part
in
it
repeat
their
experiences
and
make
some
remark
upon
them
again
and
again
in
exactly
the
same
words
their
minds
working
upon
the
subject
like
heat
upon
water
that
boils
forming
it
into
bubbles
which
it
bursts
and
incessantly
he
began
each
time
with
that
remark
of
angelica
about
the
change
which
mere
dress
effects
and
went
on
to
wonder
at
the
transformation
of
a
strong
young
woman
into
a
slender
boy
by
it
and
then
went
on
to
accept
her
conclusion
that
it
was
natural
he
should
have
been
deceived
seeing
that
in
the
first
place
he
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
and
in
the
second
he
had
never
seen
the
boy
except
in
his
own
dimly
lighted
room
or
out
of
doors
at
night
besides
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
boy
had
been
successfully
personated
by
a
girl
a
man
by
a
woman
but
here
he
found
himself
obliged
to
rehearse
the
instances
which
angelica
had
quoted
then
he
would
reconsider
the
fact
that
the
part
had
been
well
played
not
only
attitudes
and
gestures
but
ideas
and
sentiments
and
the
proper
expression
of
them
had
been
done
to
perfection
which
led
up
again
to
another
assertion
of
hers
she
had
been
a
boy
for
the
time
being
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
and
yet
if
he
had
had
the
slightest
suspicion
there
had
been
the
shyness
at
first
which
had
worn
off
as
it
became
apparent
that
the
disguise
was
complete
the
horror
of
being
touched
or
startled
of
anything
as
he
now
perceived
which
might
have
caused
a
momentary
forgetfulness
and
so
have
led
to
the
boyishnesses
which
alternating
with
older
moods
might
have
suggested
something
but
had
only
charmed
him
the
womanishnesses
of
which
alas
there
had
been
too
few
as
seen
by
the
light
of
this
new
revelation
the
physical
differences
but
they
had
been
cleverly
concealed
as
she
said
by
the
cut
of
her
clothing
and
pads
the
funny
head
however
about
which
they
had
both
jested
so
often
oh
dear
how
sick
he
was
of
the
whole
subject
if
only
it
would
let
him
alone
but
what
pretty
ways
he
had
had
the
boy
what
a
dear
dear
lad
he
had
been
with
all
his
faults
alas
alas
if
only
the
boy
had
been
left
him
then
a
pause
then
off
again
he
had
been
enchanted
like
reymond
of
lusignan
in
olden
times
by
a
creature
that
was
half
a
monster
the
boy
had
been
a
reality
to
him
but
the
lady
had
never
been
more
than
a
lovely
dream
and
the
monster
well
the
monster
had
not
yet
appeared
for
that
dark
haired
girl
in
the
unwomanly
clothes
with
pride
on
her
lips
and
pain
in
her
eyes
was
no
monster
after
all
but
an
erring
mortal
like
himself
a
poor
weak
creature
to
be
pitied
and
prayed
for
and
the
tenor
bowed
his
sunny
head
and
prayed
for
her
earnestly
through
all
the
long
hours
of
solitary
suffering
which
closed
that
day
then
came
another
sleepless
night
and
another
gloomy
morning
which
brought
his
little
chorister
boy
whom
he
tried
to
teach
as
usual
but
even
the
child
saw
what
the
effort
cost
him
and
looked
at
him
with
great
tender
eyes
solemnly
and
was
very
docile
before
the
early
service
one
of
his
fellow
lay
clerks
came
in
to
see
how
he
was
they
had
all
noticed
the
feverish
cold
from
which
he
had
appeared
to
be
suffering
the
whole
week
and
this
one
not
finding
him
better
begged
him
to
stay
in
that
day
and
take
care
of
himself
for
the
sake
of
his
voice
the
tenor
brushed
his
hand
back
over
his
hair
he
had
forgotten
that
he
ever
had
a
voice
but
at
all
events
he
must
go
to
the
morning
service
after
that
he
would
stay
at
home
he
longed
for
the
blessed
sacrament
which
was
always
a
holy
communion
to
him
but
he
did
not
say
so
that
afternoon
he
fell
asleep
in
his
facing
the
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
cathedral
or
into
a
troubled
doze
rather
from
which
he
awoke
all
at
once
with
a
start
and
seeing
the
window
shut
rose
hurriedly
to
go
and
open
it
for
the
boy
he
had
done
so
before
at
night
often
when
he
chanced
to
forget
it
but
when
he
got
to
it
now
he
had
to
clutch
the
frame
to
support
himself
and
he
looked
out
stupidly
for
some
seconds
wondering
in
a
dazed
way
why
the
sun
was
shining
when
it
should
be
dark
then
suddenly
full
consciousness
returned
and
he
remembered
he
should
never
open
the
window
again
for
the
boy
never
again
he
returned
to
his
chair
after
that
and
sat
down
to
think
when
he
began
to
understand
it
thoroughly
the
meaning
of
the
last
incident
he
was
startled
out
of
the
apathy
that
oppressed
him
it
became
evident
now
that
he
was
not
merely
suffering
but
fast
becoming
disabled
by
illness
and
it
was
time
he
let
someone
know
otherwise
there
might
be
confusion
and
annoyance
about
his
work
finding
a
substitute
and
there
would
be
a
risk
about
about
what
was
he
trying
to
think
of
oh
her
name
he
might
mention
it
and
be
overheard
by
curious
people
if
he
lost
his
head
angelica
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
he
wished
he
could
forget
but
he
would
provide
against
the
danger
of
repeating
them
aloud
he
would
telegraph
to
his
own
man
the
fellow
had
written
to
him
the
other
day
being
in
want
of
a
place
a
capital
servant
and
discreet
glad
he
had
thought
of
him
and
then
there
were
other
matters
the
sensible
setting
of
his
house
in
order
which
every
man
threatened
with
illness
would
be
wise
to
see
to
there
were
several
letters
he
must
write
one
to
the
dean
amongst
others
to
ask
him
to
come
and
see
him
writing
was
a
great
effort
but
he
managed
with
much
difficulty
to
accomplish
all
that
he
had
set
himself
to
do
and
then
his
mind
was
at
rest
presently
his
old
housekeeper
came
in
with
some
tea
she
was
anxious
about
him
i
brought
you
this
sir
she
said
you
not
tasted
a
solid
morsel
since
tuesday
morning
and
this
is
thursday
afternoon
try
and
take
something
sir
it
will
do
you
good
you
must
be
getting
quite
faint
and
indeed
you
look
it
now
i
call
that
good
of
you
the
tenor
answered
hoarsely
as
he
took
the
cup
from
her
hand
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
some
tea
i
been
quite
longing
for
something
hot
to
drink
the
woman
was
examining
his
face
with
critical
kindness
she
noticed
the
constant
attempt
to
cough
and
the
painful
catching
of
the
breath
which
rendered
the
effort
abortive
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
at
all
well
sir
she
said
expecting
him
to
deny
it
but
he
did
not
i
am
not
at
all
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
confessed
i
have
just
written
to
the
dean
to
tell
him
and
a
fit
of
coughing
rendered
the
end
of
the
sentence
unintelligible
i
want
you
to
post
these
letters
he
was
able
to
say
at
last
distinctly
send
this
telegram
off
at
once
to
my
servant
and
leave
this
note
at
the
deanery
that
will
do
as
you
go
home
the
man
should
be
here
and
anything
else
there
may
be
can
be
attended
to
when
he
arrives
you
let
your
friends
know
you
not
very
well
sir
the
housekeeper
suggested
those
letters
indicating
the
ones
she
held
in
her
hand
are
to
tell
them
the
woman
seeing
to
whom
the
letters
were
addressed
and
hearing
the
tenor
talk
in
an
way
about
his
manservant
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
the
luxury
all
his
life
feared
for
a
moment
that
his
mind
was
affected
but
then
some
of
those
wild
surmises
as
to
whom
and
what
he
might
be
which
were
rife
all
over
the
ancient
city
when
he
first
arrived
recurred
to
her
and
there
slipped
from
her
unawares
the
remark
well
they
always
said
you
was
and
to
look
at
you
one
might
suppose
you
was
a
dook
or
a
markis
sir
but
i
wo
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
the
tenor
smiled
i
am
afraid
i
am
only
a
tenor
with
an
abominable
cold
he
rejoined
i
really
think
i
must
nurse
it
a
little
when
i
have
seen
the
dean
i
shall
go
to
bed
you
see
the
doctor
first
she
muttered
decisively
as
she
took
up
the
tray
and
withdrew
the
tenor
overheard
her
but
was
past
making
any
objection
he
had
managed
to
take
the
tea
and
eased
by
the
grateful
warmth
he
sank
into
another
heavy
doze
from
which
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
roused
him
it
was
evening
then
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
in
his
courteous
way
to
receive
the
doctor
was
sorry
to
trouble
him
for
anything
so
trifling
as
a
cold
would
not
have
troubled
him
in
fact
had
not
his
officious
old
housekeeper
taken
the
law
into
her
hands
but
now
that
he
had
come
was
very
glad
to
see
him
singers
as
the
doctor
knew
being
fidgety
about
their
throats
and
really
with
a
smile
even
a
cold
was
important
when
it
threatened
one
means
of
livelihood
the
doctor
responded
cheerfully
to
these
cheerful
platitudes
but
he
was
listening
and
observing
all
the
time
then
he
took
out
a
stethoscope
in
two
pieces
and
as
he
screwed
them
together
he
asked
been
wet
lately
well
yes
the
tenor
answered
something
of
that
kind
and
you
did
not
change
immediately
now
i
think
of
it
not
for
hours
in
fact
i
believe
my
things
dried
on
me
shaking
his
head
and
you
been
living
rather
low
before
that
perhaps
just
let
me
take
your
temperature
i
should
say
that
you
had
got
a
little
down
below
par
you
know
eh
well
perhaps
the
tenor
acknowledged
humph
the
doctor
glanced
at
his
clinical
thermometer
you
have
a
temperature
young
man
now
let
me
he
applied
the
stethoscope
i
am
afraid
you
are
in
for
a
bad
dose
he
said
after
a
careful
examination
i
wish
you
had
sent
for
me
hours
sooner
these
things
should
be
taken
in
time
and
it
is
marvellous
how
you
have
kept
about
so
long
but
now
go
to
bed
at
once
keep
yourself
warm
and
the
temperature
as
even
as
possible
it
is
all
a
matter
of
nursing
but
i
save
he
had
been
going
to
say
your
life
but
changed
the
phrase
your
voice
never
fear
the
tenor
smiled
pneumonia
i
suppose
he
said
interrogatively
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
the
doctor
answered
as
he
rose
to
depart
and
double
pneumonia
to
boot
i
send
you
something
to
take
at
once
and
he
hurried
away
before
the
housekeeper
had
time
to
speak
to
him
when
the
medicine
arrived
however
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
administering
a
dose
to
her
master
and
she
begged
at
the
same
time
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
house
that
night
in
case
he
wanted
anything
but
this
the
tenor
would
not
hear
of
he
did
not
think
he
should
want
anything
he
could
think
of
nothing
unfortunately
but
the
risk
of
mentioning
angelica
name
she
might
come
a
little
earlier
in
the
morning
and
get
him
some
tea
probably
he
would
be
glad
of
some
then
he
was
not
going
to
get
up
in
the
morning
he
really
meant
to
take
care
of
himself
the
housekeeper
coaxed
but
in
vain
there
was
no
place
for
her
to
sleep
in
comfort
no
bell
to
summon
her
and
as
to
sitting
up
all
night
that
was
out
of
the
question
who
would
do
her
work
in
the
morning
there
would
be
plenty
of
people
to
look
after
him
one
night
could
make
no
difference
had
she
heard
the
doctor
orders
she
would
have
disobeyed
her
master
but
as
it
was
his
manner
imposed
upon
her
he
spoke
so
confidently
and
accordingly
she
left
the
house
at
the
usual
hour
to
the
tenor
great
relief
when
she
had
gone
he
was
seized
with
an
attack
of
hćmoptysis
and
after
he
had
recovered
from
that
sufficiently
he
went
to
bed
or
rather
he
found
himself
there
not
knowing
quite
how
it
had
come
to
pass
for
the
disease
had
made
rapid
progress
in
the
last
few
hours
and
he
now
suffered
acutely
his
temperature
was
higher
and
the
terrible
sense
of
suffocation
continued
to
increase
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
dean
in
his
comfortable
looked
up
from
the
tenor
note
and
said
to
his
wife
deprecatingly
he
is
ill
it
seems
and
wishes
to
see
me
do
you
think
i
need
go
no
my
dear
not
was
the
emphatic
reply
there
can
not
be
much
the
matter
with
him
i
saw
him
out
only
yesterday
or
the
day
before
and
at
all
events
it
will
do
in
the
morning
you
must
consider
yourself
so
the
dean
stayed
at
home
to
lay
up
a
lifelong
regret
for
himself
but
not
with
an
easy
conscience
he
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
it
would
be
well
to
go
which
his
dislike
to
turning
out
on
a
raw
night
like
that
would
not
have
outweighed
without
his
wife
word
in
the
scale
nothing
was
being
done
to
relieve
the
tenor
there
were
no
medicines
regularly
administered
no
soothing
drinks
for
him
no
equable
temperature
no
boiling
water
to
keep
the
atmosphere
moist
with
steam
the
common
necessaries
of
such
a
case
all
these
the
tenor
knowing
his
danger
had
composedly
foregone
lest
perchance
in
a
moment
of
delirium
he
should
mention
a
lady
name
and
that
he
had
had
the
foresight
to
do
so
was
a
cause
of
earnest
thanksgiving
to
him
when
every
breath
of
cold
air
began
to
stab
like
a
knife
through
his
lungs
and
his
senses
wandered
away
for
lengths
of
time
which
he
could
not
compute
and
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
uttering
his
thoughts
aloud
in
spite
of
himself
it
is
not
so
very
long
till
morning
he
found
himself
saying
once
i
will
just
lie
still
and
bear
it
till
then
i
am
drowsy
enough
and
in
the
morning
but
now
all
at
once
he
asked
himself
was
there
to
be
any
more
morning
for
him
he
was
too
to
long
for
death
and
too
to
shrink
from
it
his
first
feeling
however
when
he
realized
the
near
prospect
was
nothing
but
a
kind
of
mild
surprise
that
it
should
be
near
and
even
this
was
instantly
dismissed
no
more
morning
for
him
meant
little
leisure
to
think
of
her
and
here
he
hastened
to
fold
his
hands
and
bow
his
golden
head
lord
lord
he
entreated
in
the
midst
of
his
martyrdom
make
her
a
good
woman
yet
the
bells
above
him
broke
in
upon
his
prayer
amen
and
amen
they
seemed
to
say
and
then
the
chime
for
him
with
promise
rang
its
constant
message
out
and
as
he
listened
his
heart
expanded
with
hope
his
last
earthly
sorrow
slipped
away
from
him
and
his
soul
relied
upon
the
certainty
that
his
final
supplication
was
not
in
vain
after
this
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
own
sufferings
for
a
little
then
there
came
a
blank
and
next
he
thought
he
was
singing
he
heard
his
own
marvellous
voice
and
wondered
at
it
and
he
remembered
that
once
before
he
had
had
the
same
experiences
but
when
or
where
he
could
not
recall
now
he
would
fain
have
stopped
for
every
note
was
a
dagger
in
his
breast
yet
he
found
himself
forced
to
sing
till
at
last
the
pain
aroused
him
when
full
consciousness
returned
a
terrible
thirst
devoured
him
what
would
he
not
have
given
for
a
drink
something
to
drink
and
someone
to
bring
it
to
him
what
made
him
think
of
his
mother
just
then
where
was
his
mother
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
she
should
not
be
there
to
see
him
suffer
he
had
never
a
bitter
thought
in
his
mind
about
any
person
or
thing
nor
did
he
dream
of
bemoaning
the
cruel
fate
which
left
him
now
at
his
death
as
at
his
birth
deserted
what
he
did
think
of
were
the
many
kind
people
who
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
come
to
his
assistance
had
they
but
known
his
need
but
the
torment
of
thirst
increased
upon
him
he
thought
of
the
dear
lord
in
agony
of
thirst
and
bore
it
for
a
time
then
he
remembered
that
there
must
be
water
in
the
room
with
great
difficulty
he
got
up
to
get
it
for
himself
his
face
was
haggard
and
drawn
by
this
time
and
there
were
great
black
circles
round
his
sunken
eyes
but
the
expression
of
strength
and
sweetness
had
been
intensified
if
anything
and
he
never
looked
more
beautiful
than
then
it
seemed
like
a
day
journey
to
the
washstand
he
reached
it
at
last
however
reached
it
and
grasped
the
carafe
with
such
a
feeling
of
relief
and
thankfulness
alas
it
was
empty
so
also
was
the
jug
the
woman
had
forgotten
for
once
to
fill
them
and
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
to
moisten
his
lips
tears
came
at
this
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
it
was
hard
and
he
was
much
exhausted
but
still
there
was
no
reproach
upon
his
lips
presently
he
found
himself
in
bed
again
with
his
pillows
arranged
so
as
to
prop
him
up
the
struggle
for
breath
was
awful
and
he
could
not
lie
down
he
had
only
to
fight
for
a
little
longer
however
then
suddenly
the
worst
was
over
and
at
the
same
moment
as
it
seemed
to
him
the
chime
rang
out
again
triumphantly
and
almost
immediately
afterward
his
first
friend
and
foster
father
the
rough
collier
grasped
his
hand
but
he
had
scarcely
greeted
him
when
his
second
friend
arrived
and
bending
over
him
called
him
as
of
old
julian
my
dear
dear
boy
this
reminded
the
tenor
where
the
boy
he
said
is
the
window
open
it
is
time
he
came
israfil
i
am
here
was
the
soft
response
the
tenor
face
became
radiant
all
whom
he
had
ever
cared
for
were
present
with
him
coming
as
he
called
them
even
the
dean
who
was
kneeling
now
beside
his
bed
murmuring
accustomed
prayers
what
happiness
the
tenor
murmured
i
was
so
sorrowful
this
afternoon
and
now
a
happy
death
a
happy
death
ah
boy
do
you
not
see
that
he
gives
us
our
heart
desire
he
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
and
the
tenor
face
shone
then
the
chime
was
ringing
again
and
now
it
never
ceased
for
him
he
had
sunk
into
the
last
dreamy
lethargy
from
which
only
the
clash
of
the
bells
above
roused
him
hour
by
hour
during
the
few
that
remained
but
all
sense
of
time
was
over
the
hours
were
one
and
so
the
beloved
music
accompanied
him
till
his
spirit
rose
enraptured
to
the
glory
of
the
beatific
vision
itself
it
was
just
at
the
dawn
when
the
boy
was
wont
to
leave
him
that
according
to
his
ancient
faith
the
wings
were
given
him
the
angel
guardian
led
him
and
the
true
and
beautiful
pure
spirit
was
welcomed
by
its
kindred
into
everlasting
joy
chapter
when
angelica
heard
those
dreadful
words
he
dead
miss
did
you
know
and
buried
yesterday
her
jaw
dropped
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
the
solid
earth
reel
beneath
her
the
colour
left
her
face
and
returned
to
it
red
chasing
white
as
one
breath
follows
another
and
she
glared
at
the
woman
for
her
first
indignant
thought
was
that
she
was
being
insulted
with
a
falsehood
the
thing
was
impossible
he
could
not
be
dead
and
buried
yesterday
the
woman
repeated
i
do
believe
you
angelica
exclaimed
stamping
her
foot
imperiously
the
woman
drew
herself
up
gave
one
indignant
look
then
turned
her
back
and
walked
into
the
house
angelica
ran
down
the
passage
after
her
and
grasped
her
arm
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
but
oh
do
tell
me
do
make
me
understand
for
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
it
the
woman
pushed
open
the
sitting
room
door
and
led
her
in
was
you
a
friend
of
his
miss
or
she
asked
i
am
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
angelica
answered
yes
i
was
a
friend
of
his
i
cared
for
him
greatly
it
is
only
a
few
days
since
i
saw
him
alive
and
well
oh
it
is
true
it
is
true
she
broke
off
wringing
her
hands
i
can
not
believe
it
the
woman
sat
down
threw
her
apron
back
over
her
face
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
angelica
dazed
and
stared
at
her
stupidly
the
shock
had
stunned
her
presently
the
woman
recovered
herself
and
seeing
the
lady
stony
face
forgot
her
own
trouble
for
the
moment
and
hastened
to
help
her
i
do
wonder
you
my
lady
she
said
it
bin
a
awful
blow
to
a
many
a
awful
blow
oh
i
never
thought
when
they
used
to
come
and
see
him
here
in
their
fine
carriages
and
with
their
servants
and
their
horses
and
that
as
it
was
anything
but
the
music
brought
tho
mind
you
he
was
as
easy
with
them
as
they
with
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
angelica
lips
were
so
parched
she
could
hardly
articulate
tell
me
she
gasped
tell
me
all
i
can
not
understand
the
woman
fetched
her
some
water
lie
back
a
bit
in
this
chair
she
said
and
i
just
tell
you
it
come
easier
when
you
know
when
one
knows
it
helps
a
body
you
see
it
was
this
way
and
then
she
poured
forth
the
narrative
of
those
last
sad
days
omitting
no
detail
and
angelica
listened
at
first
but
presently
she
was
seized
upon
by
the
pitifulness
of
it
all
and
then
like
scattered
raindrops
that
precede
a
heavy
shower
the
great
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
slowly
overflowed
forerunners
of
a
storm
which
burst
at
last
in
deep
convulsive
sobs
that
rent
her
so
that
her
suffering
body
came
to
the
relief
of
her
mind
i
wanted
to
stay
with
that
last
night
and
see
to
the
housekeeper
proceeded
for
the
doctor
very
words
to
me
was
when
i
went
to
fetch
before
ever
had
come
to
see
what
was
the
matter
ses
knowing
me
for
a
many
years
ses
look
after
well
sure
jenkins
ses
and
i
answered
sir
please
god
i
will
for
i
felt
as
something
was
over
me
then
i
did
little
i
knowed
what
it
was
and
i
did
my
best
to
persuade
to
let
me
stay
that
night
and
nurse
but
would
hear
of
it
said
there
was
no
need
and
what
with
the
way
as
you
did
like
to
go
agin
in
nothing
and
what
with
bein
so
cheerful
like
imposed
upon
me
so
i
went
away
oh
it
been
a
bad
business
shaking
her
head
disconsolately
a
bad
business
to
think
of
bein
alone
that
night
without
a
soul
near
and
it
last
on
earth
he
not
let
a
dog
die
so
would
angelica
sobs
redoubled
but
i
could
rest
the
woman
went
on
the
whole
night
through
i
kep
awaking
up
and
thinking
of
and
i
every
hour
strike
till
at
last
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
i
just
got
up
and
came
to
see
was
i
bin
less
tired
if
i
a
sat
up
all
night
with
and
i
came
and
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
door
there
she
threw
her
hands
before
her
i
knew
there
was
something
for
the
smell
that
met
me
in
the
passage
it
was
just
for
all
the
world
like
fresh
turned
clay
but
still
i
did
think
it
was
till
afterward
that
i
knowed
it
was
grave
and
i
went
upstairs
not
imaginin
nothin
neither
and
tapped
at
door
and
did
answer
so
i
opens
it
softly
and
ses
are
you
this
mornin
sir
i
ses
quite
softly
like
in
a
whisper
for
fear
of
wakin
if
should
be
asleep
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
need
bin
so
careful
and
i
ses
it
agin
are
you
sir
this
mornin
i
ses
you
a
good
night
i
ses
but
still
did
answer
and
it
struck
me
that
the
was
very
quiet
it
seemed
kind
of
unnatural
still
if
you
understand
so
just
without
knowin
why
like
i
pushed
the
door
open
showing
how
she
did
it
with
her
hands
little
by
little
bit
by
bit
all
for
fear
of
disturbing
till
at
last
i
steps
in
makin
no
noise
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
threw
her
apron
up
over
her
face
again
and
rocked
herself
as
she
stood
and
there
was
she
resumed
huskily
propped
up
by
pillows
in
the
bed
so
as
to
be
almost
sittin
and
the
top
one
was
a
great
broad
pillow
very
white
for
was
always
most
about
such
things
and
all
of
the
very
best
and
face
was
turned
away
from
me
as
i
came
in
so
that
i
only
saw
it
sidewise
and
just
at
first
i
thought
was
asleep
very
sound
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
and
shook
her
head
several
times
and
there
a
little
window
to
room
what
slides
along
instead
of
openin
up
she
proceeded
when
she
had
recovered
herself
sufficiently
with
small
panes
and
outside
roses
and
honeysucklers
what
made
shadows
that
flickered
for
the
was
gusty
though
bright
and
they
deceived
me
i
thought
was
natural
but
while
i
stood
there
the
sun
shone
in
and
just
touched
the
edges
of
and
it
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
crown
of
gold
against
the
white
pillows
it
did
indeed
eh
i
do
wonder
you
take
on
this
emphatically
upon
a
fresh
outburst
of
uncontrollable
grief
from
angelica
for
i
ses
to
myself
when
the
light
fell
on
face
strong
like
that
the
face
of
a
angel
i
ses
but
there
raising
her
hands
palms
outward
slowly
and
bringing
them
down
to
her
knees
again
i
ca
tell
you
but
lips
were
just
a
little
parted
with
a
sort
o
look
on
not
a
smile
you
understand
but
just
a
look
that
sweet
as
made
you
feel
like
smilin
yourself
and
skin
that
transapparent
you
expected
to
see
through
it
but
that
did
make
me
think
nothin
for
it
was
always
so
as
clear
as
your
own
if
you
excuse
the
liberty
and
some
folks
said
it
was
because
he
was
a
great
lord
in
disguise
for
such
do
fine
skins
and
some
said
it
was
because
was
so
good
but
i
think
it
was
both
myself
but
seein
slept
so
sound
i
made
bold
to
creep
in
a
little
nearer
for
was
a
picter
shaking
her
head
solemnly
an
i
was
just
what
a
proud
woman
mother
would
be
if
she
was
me
to
see
at
that
moment
an
so
beautiful
when
but
here
her
voice
broke
and
it
was
some
seconds
before
she
could
add
you
might
me
scream
at
the
cathedral
and
after
i
screamed
i
given
untold
gold
not
to
done
it
for
it
seemed
a
sin
to
make
a
noise
and
so
still
and
oh
bin
dyin
the
o
that
last
afternoon
an
i
never
suspected
more
nor
a
cold
though
i
knew
it
was
bad
an
bin
alone
the
o
that
blessed
night
a
dyin
an
sensible
they
say
to
the
last
an
not
a
soul
to
give
so
much
as
a
drink
an
the
thirst
awful
so
i
told
an
been
up
to
try
an
get
one
for
for
the
bottle
off
the
washstand
was
lyin
on
the
floor
as
if
he
dropped
it
out
of
got
up
to
get
a
drink
for
she
repeated
impressively
an
dyin
and
was
a
drop
o
water
i
knowed
it
i
knowed
it
the
moment
i
see
that
bottle
on
the
floor
i
forgot
to
bring
up
any
before
i
left
the
day
before
though
i
ses
to
myself
when
i
did
the
room
in
the
mornin
must
fetch
that
water
at
once
and
never
thought
of
it
again
from
that
moment
oh
this
is
dreadful
dreadful
angelica
moaned
eh
the
woman
ejaculated
sympathetically
and
the
part
of
it
was
the
way
they
came
when
it
was
too
late
everybody
an
me
forgive
me
thinkin
out
o
mind
when
wrote
to
an
said
they
was
friends
there
was
lordship
the
markis
o
dawne
and
two
sisters
an
that
other
great
lady
what
is
with
so
much
an
they
did
say
much
any
of
except
but
she
wept
an
wrung
and
blamed
and
everybody
for
lettin
the
master
own
way
an
leaving
as
it
seems
it
was
wish
to
be
left
alone
with
some
trouble
but
they
come
to
see
too
galbraith
and
the
markis
many
times
for
i
let
in
myself
an
never
thought
of
it
in
the
way
of
their
bein
friends
of
i
thought
they
came
about
the
music
eh
she
repeated
they
did
say
much
any
of
but
you
could
see
you
could
see
an
the
dean
came
an
you
should
full
o
remorse
was
for
not
the
night
before
though
was
asked
an
they
all
went
upstairs
to
see
an
there
so
quiet
and
all
indifferent
to
their
grief
yet
with
such
a
look
of
peace
upon
face
it
was
sweet
and
it
was
sad
too
for
all
the
world
as
if
bin
cruel
by
somebody
in
feelin
but
forgiven
an
then
bin
glad
to
go
israfil
israfil
the
wretched
angelica
moaned
aloud
she
could
picture
the
scene
her
aunt
fulda
prayerful
but
tearless
only
able
to
sorrow
as
saints
and
angels
do
ideala
with
her
great
human
heart
torn
weeping
and
wailing
and
wringing
her
hands
aunt
claudia
hard
of
aspect
and
soft
of
heart
stealthily
wiping
her
tears
as
if
ashamed
of
them
uncle
dawne
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
galbraith
standing
beside
the
bed
looking
down
on
the
marble
calm
of
the
dead
with
a
face
as
still
but
pained
in
expression
angelica
knew
them
all
so
well
it
was
easy
for
her
imagination
to
set
them
before
her
in
characteristic
attitudes
at
such
a
time
and
she
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
they
had
been
friends
of
his
although
no
hint
of
the
fact
had
ever
reached
her
they
were
a
loyal
set
in
that
little
circle
and
could
keep
counsel
among
themselves
as
she
knew
an
example
which
she
herself
would
have
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
under
similar
circumstances
so
surely
does
the
force
of
early
associations
impel
us
instinctively
to
act
on
the
principles
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
those
about
us
habitually
pursue
an
they
covered
with
flowers
an
one
or
other
of
those
great
ladies
in
the
plainest
black
dresses
with
nothin
except
just
white
linen
collar
an
cuffs
stayed
with
day
an
night
till
they
took
to
long
yesterday
the
woman
concluded
then
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
angelica
heavy
sobs
ca
i
do
nothin
for
you
the
housekeeper
asked
at
last
yes
angelica
answered
leave
me
alone
awhile
and
the
woman
had
tact
enough
to
obey
then
angelica
got
up
and
went
and
knelt
by
the
tenor
empty
chair
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
cold
cushion
it
is
true
it
is
true
it
is
true
she
wailed
again
and
again
but
it
was
long
before
she
could
think
at
all
and
her
dry
eyes
ached
for
she
had
no
more
tears
to
shed
presently
she
became
aware
of
a
withered
rose
in
the
hollow
between
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
the
back
she
knew
it
must
be
one
of
those
she
had
thrown
at
him
that
night
perhaps
the
one
he
had
carelessly
twirled
in
his
hand
while
they
talked
now
and
then
inhaling
its
perfume
as
he
listened
watching
her
with
quiet
eyes
dead
dead
she
whispered
pressing
the
dry
petals
to
her
lips
then
she
looked
about
her
the
light
of
day
falling
on
a
scene
which
was
familiar
only
by
the
subdued
light
of
a
lamp
produced
an
effect
as
of
chill
and
bareness
she
noticed
worn
places
in
the
carpet
and
a
certain
shabbiness
from
constant
use
in
everything
which
had
not
been
visible
at
night
and
now
affected
her
in
an
inexpressibly
dreary
way
there
was
very
little
difference
really
and
yet
there
was
change
which
as
she
perceived
it
began
gradually
to
bring
the
great
change
home
to
her
there
was
the
empty
chair
first
relic
in
importance
and
saddest
in
significance
there
were
his
pipes
neatly
arranged
on
a
little
fretwork
rack
which
hung
where
bell
handles
are
usually
put
beside
the
fireplace
she
remembered
having
seen
him
replace
one
of
them
the
last
time
she
was
there
and
now
she
went
over
and
touched
its
cold
stem
and
her
heart
swelled
the
stand
of
ferns
and
flowers
which
he
had
arranged
with
such
infinite
pains
to
please
the
boy
stood
in
its
accustomed
place
but
ferns
and
flowers
alike
were
dead
or
drooping
in
their
pots
untended
and
uncared
for
and
some
had
been
taken
away
altogether
leaving
gaps
on
the
stand
behind
which
the
common
grate
empty
and
rusted
from
disuse
appeared
there
was
dust
on
her
violin
case
and
dust
on
his
grand
piano
her
violin
which
he
kept
so
carefully
she
opened
the
violin
case
expecting
to
find
the
instrument
ruined
by
water
but
no
it
lay
there
snugly
on
its
velvet
cushion
without
a
scratch
on
its
polished
surface
or
an
injured
string
she
understood
and
perhaps
it
had
been
one
of
his
last
conscious
acts
to
put
it
right
for
her
he
was
always
doing
something
for
her
always
they
said
now
that
his
income
had
been
insufficient
or
that
he
gave
too
much
away
and
that
the
malady
had
been
rendered
hopeless
from
the
first
by
his
weakness
for
want
of
food
the
woman
who
waited
on
him
had
told
her
so
he
feed
that
chorister
brat
what
come
every
morning
she
said
in
a
way
that
was
shameful
but
his
own
breakfast
has
been
dry
bread
and
coffee
without
neither
sugar
nor
milk
for
many
and
many
a
day
and
his
dinner
an
ounce
of
meat
at
noon
with
never
a
bite
nor
sup
to
speak
of
at
tea
as
often
as
not
o
israfil
israfil
she
moaned
when
she
thought
of
it
there
had
always
been
food
and
wine
too
for
that
other
hungry
boy
food
and
wine
which
the
tenor
rarely
touched
she
remembered
that
now
to
see
the
boy
eat
and
be
happy
was
all
he
asked
and
if
hunger
pinched
him
he
filled
his
pipe
and
smoked
till
the
craving
ceased
she
saw
it
all
now
but
why
had
she
never
suspected
it
she
who
was
rolling
in
wealth
his
face
was
wan
enough
at
times
and
worn
to
that
expression
of
sadness
which
comes
of
privation
but
the
reason
had
never
cost
her
a
thought
and
it
was
all
for
her
or
for
him
whom
he
believed
to
be
near
and
dear
to
her
no
one
else
had
ever
sacrificed
anything
for
her
sake
no
one
else
had
ever
cared
for
her
as
he
had
cared
no
one
else
would
ever
again
oh
hateful
deception
she
threw
herself
down
on
her
knees
once
more
o
israfil
israfil
she
cried
only
forgive
me
and
i
will
be
true
only
forgive
me
and
i
will
be
true
it
was
trying
to
rain
outside
the
wind
swept
down
the
close
in
little
gusts
and
dashed
cold
drops
against
the
window
pane
and
in
the
intervals
sprays
of
the
honeysuckle
and
clematis
tapped
on
the
glass
and
the
leaves
rustled
this
roused
her
she
had
heard
them
rustle
like
that
on
many
a
moonlight
night
with
what
a
different
significance
and
he
also
used
to
listen
to
them
and
had
told
her
that
often
when
he
was
alone
at
night
and
tired
they
had
sounded
like
voices
whispering
and
had
comforted
him
for
they
had
always
said
pleasant
things
oh
gentle
loving
heart
to
which
the
very
leaves
spoke
peace
so
spiritually
perfect
was
it
and
these
were
the
same
creepers
to
which
he
had
listened
these
that
tapped
now
disconsolately
and
this
was
his
empty
chair
but
where
was
he
he
who
was
tender
for
the
tiniest
living
thing
who
had
thought
and
cared
for
everyone
but
himself
what
was
the
end
of
it
all
how
had
he
been
rewarded
his
hearth
was
cold
his
little
house
deserted
and
the
wind
and
the
rain
swept
over
his
lonely
grave
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
she
would
go
to
his
grave
she
would
find
him
while
she
stood
on
the
landing
stage
at
the
watergate
waiting
for
the
flat
ferry
boat
which
happened
to
be
on
the
farther
side
of
the
narrow
river
to
be
poled
across
to
her
the
tenor
little
chorister
boy
came
up
and
waited
too
he
had
a
rustic
posy
in
his
hand
but
there
was
no
holiday
air
in
his
manner
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
unnaturally
subdued
for
a
boy
and
angelica
somehow
knew
who
he
was
and
conjectured
that
his
errand
was
the
same
as
her
own
if
so
he
would
show
her
the
way
the
child
seemed
unconscious
of
her
presence
he
stepped
into
the
boat
before
her
and
they
stood
side
by
side
during
the
crossing
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
water
and
he
took
no
notice
of
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
when
they
reached
it
was
a
narrow
lane
a
mere
pathway
between
a
high
wall
on
the
one
hand
and
a
high
hedge
on
the
other
which
led
up
a
steep
hill
to
a
road
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
a
cemetery
the
child
followed
this
path
and
then
angelica
knew
that
she
had
been
right
in
her
conjecture
and
had
only
to
follow
him
he
led
her
quite
across
the
cemetery
to
a
quiet
corner
where
was
an
open
grassy
space
away
from
the
other
graves
two
sides
of
it
were
sheltered
by
great
horse
chestnuts
old
and
umbrageous
and
from
where
she
stood
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
city
below
of
the
cathedral
spire
appearing
above
the
trees
of
morne
in
the
same
direction
a
crest
of
masonry
crowning
the
wooded
steep
and
on
the
other
side
the
country
stretching
away
into
a
dim
blue
hazy
distance
it
was
a
lovely
spot
and
she
felt
with
a
jealous
pang
that
the
care
of
others
had
found
it
for
him
in
life
or
death
it
was
all
the
same
he
owed
her
nothing
the
grass
was
trampled
about
the
grave
there
must
have
been
quite
a
concourse
of
people
there
the
day
before
it
was
covered
with
floral
tokens
wreaths
and
crosses
with
anchors
of
hope
and
hearts
of
love
pathetic
symbols
at
such
a
time
but
was
he
really
there
under
all
that
if
she
dug
down
deep
should
she
find
him
the
little
chorister
boy
had
gone
straight
to
the
grave
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
it
he
looked
at
the
lovely
hothouse
flowers
and
then
glanced
ruefully
at
his
own
humble
offering
sweetwilliam
chiefly
snapdragon
stocks
and
nasturtium
but
he
laid
it
there
with
the
rest
and
heart
was
wrung
anew
as
she
thought
of
the
tender
pleasure
this
loving
act
of
the
child
would
have
been
to
the
tenor
yet
her
eyes
were
dry
the
boy
pressed
the
flowers
on
the
grave
as
if
he
would
nestle
them
closer
to
his
friend
and
then
all
at
once
as
he
patted
the
cold
clay
his
lip
trembled
his
chest
heaved
with
sobs
his
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
and
his
face
was
puckered
with
grief
having
accomplished
his
errand
he
got
up
from
the
ground
slapped
his
knees
to
knock
the
clay
off
them
and
still
sniffing
and
sobbing
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come
in
sturdy
dejection
all
that
was
womanly
in
angelica
went
out
to
the
poor
little
fellow
she
would
like
to
have
comforted
him
but
what
could
she
say
or
do
alas
alas
a
woman
who
can
not
comfort
a
child
what
sort
of
a
woman
is
she
presently
she
found
herself
standing
beside
the
river
looking
up
to
the
iron
bridge
that
crossed
it
with
one
long
span
there
were
trees
on
one
side
of
the
bridge
and
old
houses
piled
up
on
the
other
picturesquely
israfil
had
noticed
them
the
last
time
they
rowed
down
the
river
the
evening
was
closing
in
the
sky
was
deepening
from
gray
to
indigo
there
was
one
bright
star
above
the
bridge
but
why
had
she
come
here
she
had
not
come
to
see
a
bridge
with
one
great
star
above
it
nor
to
watch
a
sullen
river
slipping
by
unless
indeed
she
bent
over
the
water
peering
into
it
she
remembered
that
after
the
first
plunge
there
had
been
no
great
pain
and
even
if
there
had
been
what
was
physical
pain
compared
to
this
terrible
heartache
this
dreadful
remorse
an
incurable
malady
of
the
mind
which
would
make
life
a
burden
to
her
forevermore
if
she
had
the
patience
to
live
patience
and
angelica
what
an
impossible
association
of
ideas
her
face
relaxed
at
the
humour
of
it
and
it
was
with
a
smile
that
she
turned
to
gather
her
summer
drapery
about
her
bending
sideways
to
reach
back
to
the
train
of
her
dress
as
the
insane
fashion
of
tight
skirts
which
were
then
in
vogue
necessitated
in
the
act
however
she
became
aware
of
someone
hastening
after
her
and
the
next
moment
a
soft
white
hand
grasped
her
arm
and
drew
her
back
angelica
how
can
you
stand
so
near
the
edge
in
this
uncertain
light
i
really
thought
you
would
lose
your
balance
and
fall
in
it
was
lady
fulda
who
spoke
uttering
the
words
in
an
irritated
almost
angry
tone
as
mothers
do
when
they
relieve
their
own
feelings
by
scolding
and
shaking
a
child
that
has
escaped
with
a
bruise
from
some
danger
to
life
and
limb
but
that
was
all
she
ever
said
on
the
subject
and
consequently
angelica
never
knew
if
she
had
guessed
her
intention
or
only
been
startled
by
her
seeming
carelessness
as
she
professed
to
be
the
sudden
impulse
passed
from
angelica
as
is
the
way
with
morbid
impulses
the
moment
she
ceased
to
be
alone
the
first
word
was
sufficient
to
take
her
out
of
herself
to
recall
her
to
her
normal
state
and
to
readjust
her
view
of
life
setting
it
back
to
the
proper
focus
but
still
she
looked
out
at
the
world
from
a
low
level
if
healthy
a
dull
dead
level
the
mean
temperature
of
which
was
chilly
while
the
atmosphere
threatened
to
vary
only
from
stagnant
apathy
to
boisterous
discontent
positive
hopeless
and
unconcealed
moved
by
common
consent
the
two
ladies
turned
from
the
river
and
walked
on
slowly
together
and
in
silence
the
feeling
uppermost
in
mind
was
one
of
resentment
her
aunt
had
appeared
in
the
same
unexpected
manner
at
the
outset
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
tenor
and
she
objected
to
her
reappearance
now
at
the
conclusion
it
was
like
an
incident
in
a
melodrama
the
arrival
of
the
good
influence
it
was
absurd
if
she
had
done
it
on
purpose
it
would
have
been
impertinent
the
entrance
to
ilverthorpe
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
where
they
had
met
and
they
had
now
reached
a
postern
which
led
into
the
grounds
angelica
opened
it
with
a
latchkey
and
then
stood
to
let
her
aunt
pass
through
before
her
i
suppose
you
will
come
in
she
said
ungraciously
but
lady
fulda
forgave
the
discourtesy
and
the
two
walked
on
together
up
to
the
house
passing
while
their
road
lay
through
the
park
under
old
forest
trees
that
swayed
continually
in
a
rising
gale
and
somewhat
buffeted
by
the
wind
till
they
came
to
a
narrow
path
sheltered
by
rows
of
tall
shrubs
on
the
thick
foliage
of
which
the
rain
which
had
fallen
at
intervals
during
the
day
had
collected
and
now
splashed
in
their
faces
or
fell
in
wetting
drops
upon
their
dresses
as
the
bushes
struck
by
the
heavy
gusts
swayed
to
and
fro
angelica
whose
nervous
system
was
peculiarly
susceptible
to
discomfort
of
the
kind
felt
more
wretched
than
ever
she
thought
of
the
desolate
grave
with
bedraggled
flowers
upon
it
and
of
the
golden
head
and
beautiful
calm
face
beneath
thought
of
him
as
we
are
apt
to
think
of
our
dead
at
first
imagining
them
still
sentient
aware
of
the
horror
of
their
position
crushed
into
their
narrow
beds
with
a
terrible
weight
of
earth
upon
them
left
out
alone
in
the
cold
uncomforted
and
uncared
for
while
those
they
loved
and
trusted
most
recline
in
easy
chairs
round
blazing
fires
talking
forgetfully
something
like
this
flashed
through
mind
and
a
cry
as
of
acute
pain
escaped
from
her
unawares
her
companion
features
contracted
for
a
moment
but
otherwise
she
made
no
sign
of
having
heard
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
since
they
had
entered
the
grounds
but
now
the
gentle
lady
fulda
began
again
with
some
trepidation
however
for
angelica
manner
continued
to
be
chilling
not
to
say
repellent
and
she
could
not
tell
how
her
advances
would
be
received
i
was
looking
for
you
she
said
for
me
raising
her
eyebrows
yes
i
went
to
his
house
this
afternoon
and
heard
from
the
housekeeper
that
a
young
lady
had
been
there
and
i
felt
sure
from
the
description
and
and
likelihood
that
it
must
be
you
she
said
you
had
been
wholly
unprepared
for
the
dreadful
news
and
it
had
been
a
great
shock
to
you
and
i
thought
you
would
probably
go
to
see
his
grave
it
is
always
first
impulse
and
i
was
going
to
look
for
you
there
when
i
saw
you
in
the
distance
on
the
towing
path
angelica
preserved
her
ungracious
silence
but
her
attention
was
attracted
by
the
way
in
which
her
aunt
spoke
of
the
tenor
in
regard
to
herself
apparently
as
if
she
had
known
of
their
intimacy
lady
fulda
resumed
however
before
angelica
had
asked
herself
how
this
could
be
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
a
very
meddling
person
she
said
speaking
to
her
young
niece
with
the
respect
and
unassuming
diffidence
of
high
breeding
and
good
feeling
but
perhaps
you
know
how
one
fancies
that
one
can
do
something
or
say
something
or
that
one
ought
to
try
to
i
believe
it
is
a
comfort
to
one
self
to
be
allowed
to
try
yes
angelica
assented
thinking
of
her
desire
to
help
the
child
and
thawing
with
interest
at
this
expression
of
an
experience
similar
to
her
own
i
felt
something
of
that
a
while
ago
they
had
reached
the
house
by
this
time
and
angelica
ushered
her
aunt
in
then
led
her
to
the
drawing
room
where
she
herself
usually
sat
the
one
that
opened
onto
the
terrace
this
was
the
sheltered
side
of
the
house
that
day
and
the
windows
stood
wide
open
making
the
room
as
fresh
as
the
outer
air
they
sat
themselves
down
at
one
of
them
from
which
they
could
see
the
tops
of
trees
swaying
immediately
beneath
and
further
off
the
river
then
the
green
upland
terminating
in
a
distance
of
wooded
hills
i
always
think
this
is
prettier
than
the
view
from
morne
although
not
so
fine
lady
fulda
remarked
tentatively
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
way
in
which
angelica
in
her
present
mood
might
receive
any
observation
of
hers
however
inoffensive
she
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
when
she
spoke
but
the
silence
which
followed
caused
her
to
turn
and
look
at
angelica
the
latter
had
risen
for
some
purpose
she
could
not
remember
what
and
now
stood
staring
before
her
in
a
dazed
way
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
dear
lady
fulda
said
taking
her
hand
affectionately
oh
i
am
well
enough
angelica
answered
almost
snatching
her
hand
away
and
making
a
great
effort
to
control
another
tempest
of
tears
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
but
do
do
expect
me
to
be
polite
or
anything
you
do
know
she
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
the
trouble
of
her
mind
betrayed
her
o
aunt
fulda
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
and
wringing
them
i
have
done
such
a
dreadful
thing
i
know
was
the
unexpected
rejoinder
angelica
hands
dropped
and
she
stared
at
her
aunt
her
thoughts
taking
a
new
departure
under
the
shock
of
this
surprise
did
he
tell
you
she
demanded
no
lady
fulda
stammered
i
saw
you
with
him
several
times
at
first
i
thought
it
was
diavolo
and
i
did
not
wonder
he
is
so
naughty
or
rather
he
used
to
be
but
when
i
asked
with
whom
he
was
staying
everybody
was
amazed
and
maintained
that
he
had
not
been
in
the
neighbourhood
at
all
so
i
wrote
to
him
at
sandhurst
and
his
reply
convinced
me
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
then
i
began
to
suspect
in
fact
i
was
sure
lady
fulda
spoke
nervously
and
with
her
accustomed
simplicity
but
angelica
felt
the
fascination
of
the
singular
womanly
power
which
her
aunt
exercised
and
resented
it
is
that
all
she
said
defiantly
why
did
you
interfere
for
one
thing
because
i
did
not
like
to
why
on
your
account
did
you
know
i
was
deceiving
him
yes
or
you
would
not
have
been
with
him
under
such
circumstances
lady
fulda
rejoined
and
then
i
thought
upon
the
whole
it
was
better
not
to
interfere
she
broke
off
recurring
once
more
to
angelica
question
i
was
sure
he
would
find
you
out
sooner
or
later
and
then
i
knew
he
would
do
what
was
right
and
in
the
meantime
the
companionship
of
such
a
man
under
any
circumstances
was
good
for
you
you
seem
to
know
him
very
well
yes
lady
fulda
answered
he
was
at
the
university
with
your
uncle
dawne
and
george
galbraith
they
were
great
friends
and
used
to
come
to
the
castle
a
good
deal
at
that
time
but
eventually
julian
visits
had
to
be
discontinued
lady
fulda
coloured
painfully
as
she
made
this
last
statement
and
angelica
always
apt
to
put
two
and
two
together
instantly
inserted
this
last
fragment
into
an
imperfect
story
she
possessed
of
a
love
affair
and
disappointment
of
her
aunt
and
made
the
tale
complete
she
had
heard
that
never
maiden
glow
but
that
was
in
her
earlier
maidenhood
with
such
a
fervent
flame
of
human
love
which
being
rudely
blunted
glanced
and
shot
only
to
holy
things
to
prayer
and
praise
she
gave
herself
to
fast
and
alms
they
must
have
been
about
the
same
age
angelica
reflected
as
she
examined
the
lineless
perfection
of
lady
fulda
face
and
then
there
glanced
through
her
mind
a
vision
of
what
might
have
been
what
ought
to
have
been
as
it
seemed
to
her
but
why
should
he
have
been
banished
from
the
castle
because
you
cared
for
him
she
asked
point
blank
lady
fulda
confusion
increased
that
was
not
the
reason
she
faltered
making
a
brave
effort
to
confide
in
angelica
in
the
hope
of
winning
the
latter
confidence
in
return
there
was
a
dreadful
mistake
your
grandfather
thought
he
was
paying
attention
to
me
and
spoke
to
him
about
it
telling
him
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
marry
beneath
me
and
julian
said
not
meaning
any
affront
to
me
never
dreaming
that
i
cared
that
he
had
not
intended
to
ask
me
which
made
my
father
angry
and
unreasonable
and
he
scolded
me
because
he
had
made
a
mistake
men
do
that
dear
you
know
they
have
so
little
sense
of
justice
and
and
i
had
little
in
those
days
either
and
i
retorted
and
told
my
father
he
had
spoilt
my
life
for
i
thought
it
would
have
been
different
if
he
had
not
interfered
however
i
do
know
she
sighed
regretfully
but
when
such
absolute
uncertainty
prevailed
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
julian
was
beneath
me
by
birth
and
as
to
position
but
there
she
broke
off
of
course
he
never
came
amongst
us
any
more
otherwise
i
should
have
known
him
all
my
life
angelica
exclaimed
and
there
would
have
been
none
of
this
misery
they
had
returned
to
their
seats
and
she
sat
now
frowning
for
some
seconds
then
asked
her
aunt
does
uncle
dawne
know
did
you
tell
him
about
my
escapade
no
you
are
a
singularly
reticent
person
i
am
a
singularly
one
lady
fulda
answered
and
very
full
of
remorse
for
i
think
now
i
might
have
done
something
to
prevent
she
stammered
the
final
catastrophe
angelica
concluded
then
you
are
laying
his
death
at
my
door
oh
no
heaven
forbid
her
aunt
protested
a
long
pause
ensued
which
was
broken
by
lady
fulda
rising
it
is
time
i
returned
she
said
come
back
with
me
to
morne
it
will
be
less
miserable
for
you
than
staying
here
alone
angelica
looked
up
at
her
for
a
second
or
two
with
a
perfectly
blank
countenance
then
rose
slowly
how
do
you
propose
to
return
she
asked
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
left
the
carriage
in
morningquest
lady
fulda
answered
really
aunt
fulda
angelica
snapped
then
rang
the
bell
impatiently
you
ca
walk
back
to
morningquest
and
be
in
time
for
dinner
at
the
castle
also
i
should
think
the
carriage
immediately
this
was
to
the
man
who
had
answered
the
bell
you
will
accompany
me
lady
fulda
meekly
pleaded
i
suppose
so
was
the
ungracious
rejoinder
that
is
if
you
will
decide
for
me
i
am
tired
of
action
i
just
want
to
drift
come
then
said
lady
fulda
kindly
chapter
vi
i
am
tired
of
action
i
just
want
to
drift
i
am
tired
of
action
i
just
want
to
drift
this
was
the
new
refrain
which
set
itself
as
an
accompaniment
to
angelica
thoughts
she
was
tired
of
thinking
too
but
thought
ran
on
an
inexhaustible
stream
and
the
more
passive
she
became
to
the
will
of
others
outwardly
the
more
active
was
her
mind
she
leant
back
languidly
in
the
carriage
beside
her
aunt
as
they
drove
together
through
the
city
to
morne
and
remained
silent
the
whole
time
and
motionless
all
but
her
eyes
which
roved
incessantly
from
object
to
object
while
she
inwardly
rendered
an
account
to
herself
of
each
and
of
her
own
state
of
mind
keeping
up
disjointed
comments
quotations
and
reflections
consciously
but
without
power
to
check
the
flow
there
were
a
few
blessed
moments
of
oblivion
caused
by
the
bustle
of
their
departure
from
the
house
then
angelica
looked
up
and
instantly
her
intellect
awoke
they
were
driving
down
the
avenue
the
green
leaves
rustle
overhead
was
the
first
impression
that
formulated
itself
into
words
the
carriage
wheels
roll
rhythmically
every
faculty
is
on
the
alert
there
is
something
unaccustomed
in
the
aspect
of
things
things
familiar
this
once
familiar
scene
a
new
point
of
view
the
change
is
in
me
we
used
to
ride
down
that
lane
blackberries
the
day
i
found
a
worm
in
one
ugh
diavolo
diavolo
no
longer
in
touch
a
hundred
thousand
miles
away
what
does
it
matter
i
am
tired
of
action
i
just
want
to
drift
i
am
tired
of
action
i
just
want
to
drift
just
want
to
drift
drifting
now
to
morne
a
restful
place
but
i
shall
drift
from
thence
again
whither
better
be
steered
no
though
i
am
not
a
wooden
ship
to
be
steered
but
a
human
soul
with
a
sacred
individuality
to
be
preserved
and
the
grand
right
of
private
judgment
what
happens
when
such
ennobling
privileges
are
sacrificed
demon
worship
grandpapa
the
old
duke
sat
in
his
velvet
cap
in
a
carved
oak
chair
in
the
oriel
room
nonsense
and
aunt
fulda
as
passive
as
a
cow
is
she
though
is
angelica
as
passive
as
a
cow
for
all
that
she
so
still
poor
daddy
drudging
at
the
house
just
now
not
thinking
of
me
i
hope
not
do
i
hope
not
no
he
belongs
to
me
and
i
care
for
him
the
kind
eyes
the
kind
caress
the
kind
thought
dear
o
daddy
i
sorry
i
tormented
you
sorry
sorry
the
lonely
grave
the
lonely
grave
o
israfil
dead
long
dead
and
my
heart
is
a
handful
of
dust
the
horses
hoofs
beat
out
the
measure
of
my
misery
the
green
leaves
rustle
overhead
the
air
is
delicious
after
the
rain
the
dust
is
laid
only
this
afternoon
i
went
to
see
him
what
was
i
thinking
of
can
i
bring
him
back
again
never
again
never
again
only
this
afternoon
but
time
is
not
measured
by
minutes
time
is
measured
by
the
consciousness
of
it
dead
miss
have
you
heard
and
buried
yesterday
dead
long
dead
the
dearest
friend
to
me
the
kindest
man
the
best
conditioned
and
unwearied
spirit
in
doing
courtesies
on
through
the
dim
rich
city
a
pretty
girl
and
poor
do
you
envy
me
my
dear
stare
at
me
hard
i
am
a
rich
lady
you
see
asked
everywhere
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
you
are
not
one
to
be
desired
the
palace
poor
edith
here
we
are
at
the
castle
hill
and
that
idiot
aunt
fulda
has
forgotten
her
carriage
shall
i
remind
her
there
is
still
time
to
turn
back
no
do
trouble
yourself
them
alone
and
come
home
i
wish
i
had
no
memory
it
is
a
perfect
nuisance
to
have
to
think
in
inverted
commas
all
the
time
and
shakespeare
is
the
greatest
bore
of
all
the
whole
of
life
could
be
set
to
his
expressions
that
can
not
be
quite
right
what
i
mean
is
the
whole
of
life
could
be
expressed
in
his
words
diavolo
and
i
tried
once
to
talk
shakespeare
for
a
whole
day
i
made
the
game
but
diavolo
could
remember
nothing
but
be
or
not
to
be
which
went
no
way
at
all
when
he
tried
to
live
on
it
so
he
said
shakespeare
was
rot
and
i
pulled
his
hair
i
wish
i
could
stop
thinking
suspend
my
thoughts
the
pine
woods
from
the
top
of
the
upright
pine
the
snowlumps
fall
with
a
thud
come
from
where
the
sunbeams
shine
to
lie
in
the
heart
of
the
mud
the
heart
of
the
mud
the
heart
of
the
mud
oh
for
oblivion
nirvana
dewdrop
slips
into
the
shining
sea
we
slipping
into
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
how
many
weary
women
women
waiting
happy
women
despairing
women
thoughtful
women
thoughtless
women
have
those
rows
of
winking
windows
eyed
as
they
entered
women
are
much
more
interesting
than
men
the
lonely
grave
the
lonely
grave
angelica
lady
fulda
exclaimed
as
they
drew
up
at
the
door
i
left
the
carriage
in
morningquest
yes
i
know
said
angelica
my
dear
child
why
did
you
remind
me
angelica
shrugged
her
shoulders
let
them
alone
and
they
come
home
recurred
to
her
and
then
i
must
be
more
gracious
aunt
fulda
aloud
who
are
here
your
uncle
dawne
and
i
suppose
angelica
concluded
derisively
your
aunt
claudia
and
her
friend
are
also
here
lady
fulda
corrected
her
with
dignity
not
exactly
a
successful
attempt
to
be
gracious
angelica
thoughts
ran
on
ah
well
what
does
it
matter
live
and
let
live
forget
and
forgive
forgetting
forgiving
and
everyone
forgets
and
then
again
the
lonely
grave
the
lonely
grave
at
dinner
she
sat
beside
her
grandfather
her
uncle
being
opposite
silent
and
serious
as
usual
but
they
were
all
subdued
that
night
except
the
old
duke
who
unaware
of
any
cause
for
their
painful
preoccupation
and
glad
to
see
angelica
who
roused
him
as
a
rule
with
her
wonderful
spirits
chatted
inconsequently
but
angelica
unnatural
quietude
could
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
rest
of
the
party
and
inquiring
glances
were
directed
to
lady
fulda
in
the
calm
of
whose
passionless
demeanour
however
there
was
no
consciousness
of
anything
unusual
to
be
read
and
of
course
no
questions
were
asked
in
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
angelica
sat
on
a
velvet
cushion
at
her
uncle
feet
and
rested
her
head
against
his
knee
close
beside
her
there
was
a
long
narrow
mirror
let
into
the
wall
of
the
room
like
a
panel
and
in
this
she
could
see
herself
and
him
reflected
at
first
she
turned
from
the
group
impatiently
but
presently
she
looked
again
and
began
to
study
her
uncle
appearance
with
conscious
deliberation
it
was
as
if
she
had
never
seen
him
before
and
was
receiving
a
first
impression
lord
dawne
was
one
of
those
men
who
make
one
think
of
another
and
more
picturesque
age
he
would
have
looked
natural
in
black
velvet
and
point
lace
he
was
about
five
and
thirty
at
that
time
to
judge
by
his
appearance
tall
and
strong
with
the
slim
strength
of
a
race
horse
ail
superfluous
flesh
and
bone
bred
out
of
him
his
skin
was
dark
clear
and
colourless
his
hair
black
wavy
and
abundant
his
eyes
deep
blue
a
contrast
inherited
from
an
irish
mother
a
spanish
hidalgo
in
appearance
angelica
decided
at
this
point
it
was
a
sad
face
as
faces
often
are
you
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
hear
that
his
life
had
been
blighted
at
the
outset
by
some
great
sorrow
or
disappointment
but
it
was
a
strong
face
too
the
face
of
a
manly
man
you
would
have
said
and
of
one
with
courage
endurance
and
devotion
enough
for
a
hero
and
a
martyr
angelica
her
grandfather
broke
in
upon
her
reflections
with
kindly
concern
you
look
pale
do
you
not
feel
well
my
dear
child
not
exactly
thank
you
angelica
answered
mendaciously
with
formal
politeness
hoping
thereby
to
save
herself
the
annoyance
of
further
remarks
then
inwardly
added
sick
at
heart
in
very
truth
to
save
her
conscience
which
was
painfully
sensitive
just
then
when
anyone
addressed
her
thought
was
suspended
by
the
effort
to
answer
after
which
the
rush
returned
but
the
current
had
usually
set
in
a
new
direction
as
was
now
the
case
her
uncle
as
seen
in
the
mirror
gave
place
when
she
had
spoken
to
the
tenor
long
low
room
as
she
had
seen
it
that
afternoon
the
light
shone
in
and
showed
the
shabby
places
should
the
light
be
shut
out
to
conceal
what
is
wrong
oh
no
show
up
expose
make
evident
let
in
knowledge
the
light
but
here
her
grandfather
arose
the
evening
was
to
end
with
service
in
the
chapel
will
you
come
angelica
he
asked
do
you
feel
equal
to
the
exertion
oh
yes
angelica
answered
indifferently
letting
herself
go
again
to
drift
with
the
stream
the
private
chapel
at
morne
was
lavishly
decorated
an
ideal
shrine
the
beauty
of
which
alone
would
have
inclined
your
heart
to
prayer
and
praise
by
reason
of
the
pleasure
it
gave
you
and
of
the
desire
which
is
always
apart
of
this
form
of
pleasure
to
express
your
gratitude
in
some
sort
on
this
occasion
the
altar
was
brilliantly
illuminated
and
as
she
passed
in
before
lord
dawne
she
was
attracted
like
a
child
by
the
light
and
stationed
herself
so
as
to
see
it
fully
admiring
it
as
a
spectator
but
only
so
the
scene
although
familiar
was
always
impressive
being
so
beautiful
and
as
she
settled
herself
on
a
chair
apart
her
spirit
revived
under
its
influence
enough
to
enable
her
to
entertain
the
hope
that
by
force
of
habit
and
association
that
sensation
of
which
is
due
to
the
refined
and
delicate
flattery
of
the
senses
a
soothing
without
excitement
merging
in
content
and
restful
to
the
verge
of
oblivion
would
steal
over
her
and
gradually
possess
her
to
the
exclusion
of
all
importunate
and
painful
thought
and
this
was
what
happened
it
came
at
a
pause
in
the
service
when
the
people
bent
their
heads
and
seemed
to
wait
or
rather
followed
upon
that
impressive
moment
as
did
the
organ
prelude
and
the
first
notes
of
a
glorious
voice
the
voice
of
a
woman
who
suddenly
sang
angelica
looked
up
amazed
by
the
fervour
of
it
while
a
feeling
not
new
but
strange
from
its
intensity
took
possession
of
her
steeping
her
soul
in
bliss
a
feeling
that
made
her
both
tremble
and
be
glad
she
thought
no
more
of
the
lonely
grave
but
of
an
angel
in
ecstasy
an
angel
in
heaven
she
looked
around
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
altar
she
tried
to
seize
upon
some
idea
which
should
continue
with
her
and
be
a
key
with
which
she
could
unlock
this
fountain
of
joy
hereafter
when
she
would
she
almost
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
it
would
be
worthy
to
grovel
for
such
opium
at
the
knees
of
an
oleosaccharine
priest
and
contribute
to
his
support
forever
she
tried
to
think
of
something
to
which
to
compare
the
feeling
but
in
vain
in
the
effort
to
fix
it
her
mind
and
memory
became
a
blank
and
for
a
blissful
interval
she
could
not
think
she
could
only
feel
then
came
the
inevitable
moment
of
grateful
acknowledgment
when
her
senses
brought
of
their
best
to
pay
for
their
indulgence
their
best
on
this
occasion
being
that
vow
to
israfil
which
presently
she
found
herself
renewing
she
would
indeed
be
true
after
this
surfeit
of
sensuous
distraction
she
retired
to
her
room
the
old
room
as
far
away
from
diavolo
as
possible
which
she
had
always
occupied
at
the
castle
she
dismissed
her
maid
and
sat
down
to
think
but
she
was
suffering
from
nervous
irritability
by
this
time
and
could
not
rest
she
drew
up
a
blind
and
looked
out
of
the
open
window
the
night
was
calm
the
air
was
freshly
caressing
a
crescent
moon
hung
in
the
indigo
sky
and
there
were
stars
bright
stars
up
from
the
pine
woods
which
clothed
the
castle
hill
balsamic
airs
were
wafted
and
murmurs
came
as
of
voices
inviting
friendly
voices
of
nature
claiming
a
kinship
with
her
which
she
herself
had
recognized
from
her
earliest
childhood
out
there
in
the
open
was
the
unpolluted
altar
at
which
she
was
bidden
to
worship
and
in
view
of
that
with
the
healthy
breath
of
night
expanding
her
lungs
revivingly
she
felt
that
her
late
experiences
in
the
midst
of
perfumes
too
sweet
to
be
wholesome
and
with
the
help
of
accessories
too
luxurious
to
be
anything
but
enervating
had
been
degrading
to
that
better
part
of
her
to
which
the
purity
and
peace
of
night
appealed
she
would
go
shrive
herself
in
haunted
solitudes
and
listen
to
the
voice
which
spoke
to
her
heart
alone
saying
only
be
true
in
the
silence
of
those
scenes
incomparable
which
tend
to
reverence
promote
endeavour
and
prolong
love
she
went
to
her
door
opened
it
looked
out
and
listened
the
corridor
was
all
in
darkness
an
excessive
silence
pervaded
the
place
the
whole
household
had
apparently
retired
with
confident
steps
although
in
the
dark
angelica
went
to
room
and
presently
returned
with
a
suit
of
his
clothes
these
she
put
on
and
then
without
haste
went
downstairs
crossed
the
hall
opened
a
narrow
door
which
led
into
a
dark
damp
flagged
passage
along
which
she
groped
for
some
distance
then
descended
a
crooked
stone
staircase
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
heavy
door
this
she
opened
with
a
key
careless
of
the
noise
she
made
and
found
herself
out
in
the
open
air
under
the
stars
on
a
gravel
walk
with
a
broad
lawn
stretched
before
her
she
stood
a
moment
breathing
deeply
in
pure
enjoyment
of
the
air
then
put
up
both
hands
to
rearrange
a
little
cloth
cap
she
wore
which
was
slipping
from
off
her
abundant
hair
then
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
stretched
every
limb
in
the
joy
of
perfect
freedom
from
restraint
and
then
with
strong
bounds
she
cleared
the
grassy
space
dashed
down
a
rocky
step
and
found
herself
a
substance
amongst
the
shadows
out
in
the
murmuring
woods
when
she
returned
she
was
making
less
vigorous
demonstrations
of
superabundant
strength
and
vitality
but
still
her
step
was
swift
firm
and
elastic
and
she
was
running
up
the
grand
staircase
from
the
hall
when
she
saw
that
the
door
at
the
top
leading
into
the
suite
of
rooms
occupied
by
lord
dawne
when
he
was
at
the
castle
was
wide
open
showing
the
room
beyond
brilliantly
lighted
she
would
have
to
pass
that
open
door
or
stay
downstairs
till
it
was
shut
but
the
latter
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
do
so
with
scarcely
a
pause
to
nerve
herself
for
what
might
happen
she
continued
rapidly
to
ascend
the
stairs
as
she
expected
when
she
reached
the
top
her
uncle
appeared
oh
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
seeing
diavolo
as
he
supposed
emerging
from
the
darkness
i
thought
it
was
angelica
step
i
fancied
i
heard
her
go
down
some
time
ago
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
her
she
complained
of
not
feeling
well
this
evening
and
i
thought
she
might
possibly
want
something
come
in
he
had
turned
to
lead
the
way
as
he
spoke
he
broke
off
what
are
you
doing
here
you
young
rascal
angelica
overcome
by
one
of
her
mischievous
impulses
and
grinning
broadly
boldly
followed
her
uncle
into
the
room
i
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
that
you
ought
not
to
be
here
it
is
so
natural
to
find
you
marauding
about
the
place
at
night
he
pursued
bending
down
to
adjust
the
wick
of
a
lamp
that
was
flaring
as
he
spoke
angelica
sat
down
and
coolly
waited
for
him
to
turn
and
look
at
her
which
he
did
when
he
had
done
with
the
lamp
meeting
her
dark
eyes
unsuspectingly
at
first
then
with
fixed
attention
inquiringly
angelica
he
exclaimed
how
can
you
i
have
been
out
in
the
woods
she
rejoined
with
her
accustomed
candour
the
suffocating
fumes
of
incense
and
orthodoxy
overpowered
me
in
the
chapel
and
i
was
miserable
besides
but
the
fresh
air
is
a
powerful
tonic
and
it
has
exhilarated
me
the
stars
have
strengthened
me
the
voices
of
the
night
spoke
peace
to
me
and
the
pleasant
creatures
visible
and
invisible
gave
me
welcome
as
one
of
themselves
and
showed
me
how
to
attain
to
their
joy
in
life
she
bent
forward
to
brush
some
fresh
earth
from
the
leg
of
her
trousers
but
you
would
have
me
forego
these
innocent
invigorating
exercises
i
suppose
because
i
am
a
woman
she
pursued
you
would
allow
diavolo
to
disport
himself
so
at
will
and
approve
rather
than
object
although
he
is
not
so
strong
as
i
am
and
then
these
clothes
which
are
decent
and
convenient
for
him
besides
being
a
greater
protection
than
any
you
permit
me
to
wear
you
think
immodest
for
me
you
mass
of
prejudice
lord
dawne
made
no
reply
he
had
taken
a
seat
and
remained
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
for
some
seconds
after
she
had
spoken
there
was
neither
agreement
nor
dissent
in
his
attitude
however
he
was
simply
reflecting
what
is
it
angelica
he
said
at
last
looking
her
full
in
the
face
what
is
what
she
asked
defiantly
what
is
the
matter
he
answered
there
is
something
wrong
i
see
and
if
it
is
anything
that
you
would
like
to
talk
about
i
do
pretend
to
offer
yon
advice
but
sometimes
when
one
speaks
you
know
however
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
a
thing
out
as
you
used
to
call
it
when
you
were
a
little
girl
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
when
she
entered
the
room
fresh
from
the
open
air
a
brilliant
colour
glowed
in
her
cheeks
but
now
she
was
pale
to
her
lips
which
perceiving
caused
him
to
rise
hastily
and
add
but
i
am
afraid
you
have
tired
yourself
and
glancing
at
the
clock
it
is
nearly
breakfast
time
i
go
and
get
you
something
after
a
considerable
interval
he
returned
with
a
tray
upon
which
was
a
plentiful
variety
of
refreshments
prawns
in
aspic
jelly
cold
chicken
and
tongue
a
freshly
opened
tin
of
de
foie
cake
bread
butter
and
champagne
i
think
i
brought
everything
he
remarked
surveying
the
tray
complacently
when
he
had
put
it
down
upon
a
table
beside
her
you
forgotten
the
salt
snapped
angelica
his
complacency
vanished
and
he
retired
apologetically
to
remedy
the
omission
do
you
remember
the
night
you
and
diavolo
taught
me
where
to
find
food
in
my
father
house
he
asked
when
he
returned
yes
angelica
answered
with
a
grin
and
then
she
expanded
into
further
reminiscences
of
that
occasion
by
which
time
she
was
in
such
a
good
humour
that
she
began
to
feel
hungry
and
under
the
stimulating
influences
of
food
and
champagne
she
told
her
uncle
the
whole
story
of
her
intimacy
with
the
tenor
lord
dawne
listened
with
interest
but
almost
in
silence
the
occasion
was
not
one
as
it
appeared
to
him
which
it
would
be
well
to
improve
he
discussed
the
matter
with
her
however
as
well
as
he
could
without
offering
her
advice
or
expressing
an
opinion
of
her
conduct
and
in
consequence
of
this
wise
forbearance
on
his
part
she
found
herself
the
better
in
every
way
for
the
interview
chapter
vii
angelica
awoke
unrefreshed
after
a
few
hours
of
light
and
restless
sleep
much
broken
by
dreams
dead
dead
was
the
first
thought
in
her
mind
but
it
came
unaccompanied
by
any
feeling
is
israfil
really
dead
buried
gone
from
us
all
forever
she
asked
herself
in
a
kind
of
wonder
it
was
not
at
the
thought
of
his
death
that
she
was
wondering
however
but
because
the
recollection
of
it
did
not
move
her
in
any
way
reflections
which
had
caused
her
the
sharpest
misery
only
yesterday
recurred
to
her
now
without
affecting
her
in
the
least
degree
except
in
that
they
made
her
feel
herself
to
be
a
kind
of
monster
of
callousness
coldness
and
egotism
the
lonely
grave
looking
deserted
already
with
the
flowers
fading
upon
it
the
man
himself
as
she
had
known
him
his
goodness
his
kindness
the
disinterested
affection
he
had
lavished
upon
her
she
dwelt
upon
these
things
she
racked
her
brain
to
recall
them
in
order
to
reawaken
her
grief
and
remorse
but
in
vain
mind
and
memory
responded
to
the
effort
but
her
own
heart
she
could
not
touch
the
acute
stage
was
over
for
the
moment
and
a
most
distressing
numbness
attended
by
a
sense
of
chilliness
and
general
physical
discomfort
had
succeeded
it
the
rims
of
her
eyes
were
red
and
the
lids
still
swollen
by
the
tears
of
the
day
before
but
the
state
of
weeping
with
the
nervous
energy
and
mental
excitement
which
had
been
the
first
consequence
of
the
shock
was
a
happy
one
compared
with
the
dry
inhuman
apathy
of
this
and
she
strove
to
recall
it
but
only
succeeded
in
adding
the
old
sensation
of
discontent
with
everything
as
it
is
and
nothing
is
worth
while
to
her
already
deep
depression
she
loved
order
and
regularity
in
a
household
but
now
the
very
thought
of
the
old
accustomed
dull
routine
of
life
at
the
castle
exasperated
her
after
her
grandfather
would
come
her
uncle
and
after
him
in
all
human
probability
diavolo
would
succeed
and
there
would
be
a
long
succession
of
solemn
servants
each
attending
to
the
same
occupations
which
had
been
carried
on
by
other
servants
in
the
same
place
for
hundreds
of
years
horrible
monotony
all
tending
to
nothing
for
she
saw
as
in
a
vision
the
end
of
the
race
to
which
she
belonged
they
and
their
like
were
doomed
and
with
them
the
distinguished
bearing
the
reserve
the
refined
simplicity
and
dignity
of
manner
which
had
held
them
above
the
common
herd
a
class
apart
until
she
came
were
also
doomed
i
am
of
the
day
she
said
to
herself
the
vulgar
outcome
of
a
vulgar
era
bred
so
i
suppose
that
i
may
see
through
others
which
is
to
me
the
means
of
i
see
that
in
this
dispute
of
or
unwomanly
the
question
to
be
asked
is
not
is
the
pursuit
but
are
the
proceeds
no
social
ever
me
letting
a
woman
into
anything
that
pays
it
was
left
for
me
to
translate
the
principle
into
the
vernacular
she
breakfasted
upstairs
so
that
she
might
not
have
to
talk
but
went
down
immediately
afterward
in
order
to
find
somebody
to
speak
to
so
rapid
were
the
alternations
of
her
moods
it
was
not
in
angelica
nature
to
conceal
anything
she
had
done
from
her
friends
for
long
and
before
she
had
been
hours
at
the
castle
she
had
taken
her
aunt
claudia
and
the
lady
known
to
them
all
intimately
as
ideala
into
her
confidence
but
neither
of
them
attempted
to
improve
the
occasion
they
said
even
less
than
her
uncle
had
done
and
this
reticence
perplexed
angelica
she
would
have
liked
them
to
make
much
of
her
wickedness
to
have
reasoned
with
her
lectured
her
and
incited
her
to
argue
she
did
not
perceive
as
they
did
that
she
was
one
of
those
who
must
work
out
their
own
salvation
in
fear
and
trembling
and
she
was
angry
with
them
because
they
continued
their
ordinary
avocations
as
if
nothing
had
happened
when
everything
had
gone
so
wrong
with
her
the
weary
day
dragged
its
slow
length
along
a
walk
about
the
grounds
luncheon
a
long
drive
calling
at
ilverthorpe
on
the
way
back
for
letters
afternoon
tea
with
her
grandfather
in
the
oriel
room
and
afterward
the
accustomed
wait
with
bowed
head
for
the
chime
which
floated
up
at
last
from
afar
distinct
solemn
slow
and
weary
like
the
voice
of
one
who
vainly
repeats
a
blessed
truth
to
ears
that
will
not
hear
illustration
musical
notation
lyrics
he
is
ra
el
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
her
grandfather
raised
his
velvet
cap
and
held
it
above
his
bald
head
while
he
repeated
the
words
aloud
after
which
he
muttered
a
prayer
for
the
restoration
of
holy
church
then
rose
and
leaning
heavily
on
his
ebony
stick
walked
from
the
room
with
the
springless
step
of
age
accompanied
by
his
daughter
claudia
and
his
son
and
followed
by
two
deer
hounds
old
and
faithful
friends
who
seldom
left
him
when
the
door
closed
upon
this
little
procession
angelica
found
herself
alone
with
her
aunt
lady
fulda
to
whom
she
had
not
spoken
since
the
day
before
they
were
sitting
near
to
each
other
angelica
being
in
the
window
from
whence
she
had
looked
down
upon
the
and
the
distant
city
while
they
waited
for
the
chime
the
melancholy
cadence
of
which
had
added
something
to
the
chill
misery
of
her
mood
do
you
still
believe
it
she
asked
ironically
and
then
felt
as
if
she
were
always
asking
that
question
in
that
tone
lady
fulda
had
also
looked
about
as
she
listened
but
now
she
left
the
window
and
taking
a
seat
opposite
to
angelica
answered
bravely
her
face
lighting
up
as
she
spoke
i
do
believe
it
then
why
did
he
let
a
man
like
that
die
angelica
asked
defiantly
why
did
he
create
such
a
man
at
all
merely
to
kill
him
would
a
commoner
creature
have
done
as
well
we
are
not
told
that
any
creature
is
common
in
his
sight
lady
fulda
answered
gently
but
suppose
they
were
would
a
common
creature
have
produced
the
same
effect
upon
you
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
he
was
created
to
please
me
oh
no
not
that
lady
fulda
hastily
interposed
and
angelica
perceiving
that
she
had
at
last
found
somebody
who
would
kindly
improve
the
occasion
turned
round
from
the
window
and
settled
herself
for
a
fray
and
i
do
mean
lady
fulda
pursued
i
dare
not
presume
to
question
but
still
oh
i
must
say
it
your
heart
has
been
very
hard
would
anything
but
death
have
touched
you
so
had
not
every
possible
influence
been
vainly
tried
before
that
to
soften
you
angelica
smiled
disagreeably
you
are
insinuating
that
he
died
for
me
to
save
my
soul
she
politely
suggested
her
aunt
took
no
notice
of
the
sneer
oh
not
for
you
alone
she
answered
earnestly
but
for
all
the
hundreds
upon
whom
you
in
your
position
and
with
your
attractions
will
bring
the
new
power
of
your
goodness
to
bear
you
can
not
think
with
all
your
scepticism
that
such
a
man
has
lived
and
died
for
nothing
you
must
have
some
knowledge
or
idea
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
life
in
such
a
world
of
the
influence
for
good
of
a
great
talent
employed
as
his
was
the
one
as
an
example
and
the
other
as
a
power
to
inspire
and
control
angelica
did
not
attempt
to
answer
this
and
there
was
a
pause
then
she
began
again
i
did
grasp
something
of
what
you
mean
i
saw
for
a
moment
the
beauty
of
holiness
and
the
joy
of
it
continued
with
me
for
a
little
then
i
went
to
tell
israfil
i
was
determined
to
be
true
and
i
should
have
been
true
had
i
not
lost
him
but
now
my
heart
is
harder
than
ever
and
i
shall
be
worse
than
i
was
before
oh
no
her
aunt
exclaimed
you
are
deceiving
yourself
if
you
had
found
him
there
that
day
your
good
resolutions
would
only
have
lasted
until
you
had
bound
him
to
you
enslaved
him
and
then
although
you
would
have
carefully
avoided
breaking
the
letter
of
the
law
you
would
have
broken
the
spirit
you
would
have
tried
to
fascinate
him
and
bring
him
down
to
your
own
level
you
would
have
made
him
loathe
himself
and
then
you
would
have
mocked
him
like
the
heroine
of
a
railway
novel
angelica
began
then
added
doggedly
you
wrong
me
aunt
fulda
there
is
no
one
whose
respect
i
valued
more
there
is
nothing
in
right
or
reason
i
would
not
have
done
to
win
it
that
is
to
say
if
there
had
been
anything
i
could
have
done
but
i
do
not
think
now
that
there
was
this
last
depressing
thought
brought
about
another
of
those
rapid
revulsions
of
feeling
to
which
she
had
been
subject
during
these
latter
days
and
she
broke
off
for
a
moment
then
burst
out
afresh
to
just
the
opposite
effect
i
do
not
know
though
i
am
not
sure
of
anything
probably
you
are
right
and
i
deceived
myself
i
inherit
bad
principles
from
my
ancestors
and
it
may
be
that
i
can
no
more
get
rid
of
them
than
i
could
get
rid
of
the
gout
or
any
other
hereditary
malady
by
simply
resolving
to
cure
myself
it
is
different
with
you
you
were
born
good
i
was
born
bad
and
delight
in
my
wickedness
angelica
her
aunt
remonstrated
do
not
talk
in
that
reckless
way
well
i
exaggerate
angelica
allowed
veering
again
as
the
wind
does
in
squally
weather
before
it
sets
steadily
from
a
single
quarter
but
what
have
i
done
after
all
that
you
should
take
me
to
task
so
seriously
wrong
certainly
but
still
i
have
not
broken
a
single
commandment
not
one
of
the
decalogue
perhaps
but
you
have
sinned
against
the
whole
spirit
of
uprightness
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
you
may
keep
the
ten
commandments
strictly
and
yet
be
a
most
objectionable
person
you
might
smoke
drink
listen
at
doors
repeat
private
conversations
open
other
people
letters
pry
amongst
their
papers
be
vulgar
and
offensive
in
conversation
and
indecent
in
dress
altogether
detestable
if
your
code
of
morality
were
confined
to
the
ten
commandments
but
why
will
you
talk
like
this
angelica
why
will
you
be
so
defiant
when
your
heart
is
breaking
as
i
know
it
is
angelica
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
with
one
dry
sob
that
made
her
whole
frame
quiver
oh
do
not
be
so
hard
the
other
woman
implored
listen
to
your
own
heart
listen
to
all
that
is
best
in
yourself
you
have
good
impulses
enough
i
know
you
have
and
you
have
been
called
to
the
higher
life
more
than
once
but
you
would
not
hear
yes
thoughtfully
but
it
is
no
use
no
help
i
never
profit
by
experiences
because
i
do
object
to
things
while
they
are
happening
it
is
only
afterward
when
all
the
excitement
is
over
and
i
have
had
time
to
reflect
that
i
become
dissatisfied
and
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
so
as
to
display
a
fair
amount
of
slender
foot
and
stocking
as
it
is
the
elegant
fashion
of
the
day
to
do
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
ceiling
being
evidently
determined
to
let
the
subject
drop
lady
fulda
compressed
her
lips
she
was
baffled
and
she
was
perplexed
a
quarter
rang
from
the
city
clocks
do
you
know
she
began
again
i
have
a
fancy
many
people
have
that
a
time
comes
to
us
all
an
hour
when
we
are
called
upon
to
choose
between
good
and
evil
it
is
a
quarter
since
we
heard
the
chime
only
a
quarter
angelica
ejaculated
it
seems
an
age
but
suppose
this
is
your
hour
lady
fulda
patiently
pursued
one
precious
quarter
of
it
has
gone
already
and
still
you
harden
your
heart
you
are
asked
to
choose
now
you
are
called
to
the
higher
life
you
must
know
that
you
are
being
called
specially
this
moment
and
what
if
it
should
be
for
the
last
time
what
if
after
this
you
are
deprived
of
the
power
to
choose
and
forced
by
that
which
is
evil
in
you
to
wander
away
from
ail
that
is
good
and
pure
and
pleasant
into
the
turmoil
and
trouble
the
falseness
the
illusion
and
the
maddening
unrest
of
the
other
life
you
know
it
all
you
can
imagine
what
it
would
be
when
that
last
loophole
of
escape
upon
which
we
all
rely
perhaps
unconsciously
was
closed
when
you
knew
you
never
could
return
when
you
came
to
be
shut
out
from
hope
a
prey
to
remorse
a
tired
victim
compelled
to
pursue
excitement
and
always
to
pursue
it
descending
all
the
time
and
finding
it
escape
you
more
and
more
till
at
last
even
that
hateful
resource
was
lost
to
you
and
you
found
yourself
at
the
end
of
the
road
to
perdition
a
worn
out
woman
face
to
face
with
despair
angelica
slowly
unclasped
her
hands
from
behind
her
head
let
her
chin
sink
on
her
chest
and
looked
up
from
under
her
eyebrows
at
her
aunt
her
eyes
were
bright
but
otherwise
her
face
was
as
still
as
a
statue
and
what
she
thought
or
felt
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
choice
she
answered
coldly
i
chosen
honestly
i
told
you
you
see
what
has
come
of
it
forgive
me
said
lady
fulda
but
you
had
not
chosen
you
had
not
chosen
the
better
life
to
lead
it
for
its
own
sake
but
for
his
you
wanted
to
bring
yourself
nearer
to
him
and
you
would
have
made
goodness
a
means
to
that
end
if
you
could
but
you
see
it
was
not
the
right
way
and
it
has
not
succeeded
angelica
sat
up
and
the
dull
look
left
her
face
she
seemed
interested
you
see
through
all
my
turpitude
she
observed
affecting
to
smile
although
in
truth
she
was
more
moved
than
her
pride
would
allow
her
to
show
her
aunt
sighed
seeing
no
sign
of
softening
she
feared
it
was
labour
lost
but
still
she
felt
impelled
to
try
once
more
before
she
renounced
the
effort
she
was
nervous
about
it
however
being
naturally
diffident
and
hesitated
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
in
the
interval
the
evening
shadows
deepened
the
half
hour
chimed
from
the
city
clocks
and
then
she
spoke
just
think
she
said
sadly
just
think
what
it
will
be
when
you
have
gone
from
here
this
evening
if
you
carry
out
your
determination
and
return
after
dinner
just
think
what
it
will
be
when
you
find
yourself
alone
again
in
that
great
house
with
the
night
before
you
and
your
aching
heart
and
your
bitter
thoughts
and
the
remorse
which
gnaws
without
ceasing
for
companions
and
not
one
night
of
it
only
but
all
the
years
to
come
and
every
phase
of
it
from
the
sharp
pain
of
this
moment
to
the
dull
discontent
in
which
it
ends
and
from
which
nothing
on
earth
will
rouse
you
think
of
yourself
then
without
comfort
and
without
hope
angelica
changed
her
position
uneasily
you
still
hesitate
lady
fulda
continued
you
are
loath
to
commit
yourself
you
would
rather
not
choose
you
prefer
to
believe
yourself
a
puppet
at
the
mercy
of
a
capricious
demon
who
moves
you
this
way
and
that
as
the
idle
fancy
seizes
him
but
you
are
no
puppet
you
have
the
right
of
choice
you
choose
and
having
chosen
if
you
look
up
the
power
divine
will
be
extended
to
you
to
support
you
or
but
either
way
your
choice
will
at
once
become
a
force
for
good
or
evil
she
ended
abruptly
and
then
there
was
another
long
pause
angelica
mind
was
alive
to
everything
to
the
rustle
of
summer
foliage
far
below
to
the
beauty
of
the
woman
before
her
to
the
power
of
her
presence
to
the
absolute
integrity
which
was
so
impressive
in
all
she
said
to
her
simplicity
to
the
grace
of
her
attitude
at
that
moment
as
she
sat
with
an
elbow
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
covering
her
eyes
with
one
white
hand
to
the
tearless
turmoil
in
her
own
breast
the
sense
of
suffering
not
to
be
relieved
the
hopeless
ache
was
there
any
way
of
escape
from
herself
her
conscience
whispered
one
but
was
there
only
one
the
struggle
of
the
last
few
days
had
recommenced
was
it
to
go
on
like
this
forever
and
ever
over
and
over
again
what
a
prospect
and
oh
to
be
able
to
end
it
somehow
anyhow
oh
for
the
courage
to
choose
but
she
must
choose
she
knew
that
aunt
fulda
was
right
her
hour
had
come
the
momentous
question
had
been
asked
and
it
must
be
answered
once
for
all
if
she
should
refuse
to
take
the
hand
held
out
to
help
her
now
where
would
she
drift
to
eventually
should
she
end
by
consorting
with
people
like
and
she
thought
of
an
odious
woman
or
come
to
be
talked
of
at
clubs
named
lightly
by
low
men
and
she
thought
of
some
specimens
of
that
class
but
why
should
she
arrive
at
any
decision
why
should
she
feel
compelled
to
adopt
a
settled
plan
of
action
why
could
she
not
go
on
as
she
had
done
hitherto
was
there
really
no
standing
still
were
people
really
rising
or
sinking
always
doing
good
or
evil
why
no
for
what
harm
had
she
done
quick
answering
to
the
question
with
a
pang
the
rush
of
recollection
caught
her
and
again
the
vow
made
and
forgotten
for
the
moment
as
soon
as
made
burned
in
her
heart
israfil
israfil
only
forgive
me
and
i
will
be
true
she
did
not
wait
to
think
again
the
mere
repetition
was
a
renewal
of
her
vow
and
in
the
act
she
had
unconsciously
decided
slipping
from
her
chair
to
the
ground
she
laid
her
head
on
lady
lap
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
myself
she
said
sighing
deeply
you
must
help
me
aunt
fulda
now
the
dear
lord
help
you
was
the
soft
reply
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
city
clocks
began
to
strike
and
they
both
raised
their
heads
involuntarily
waiting
for
the
chime
it
rang
at
last
with
a
new
significance
for
angelica
the
hour
was
over
which
had
been
her
hour
a
chapter
of
her
life
had
closed
with
it
forever
and
when
she
looked
up
then
she
found
herself
in
another
world
wherein
she
would
walk
henceforth
with
other
eyes
to
better
purpose
chapter
viii
angelica
drove
back
to
ilverthorpe
alone
directly
after
dinner
and
went
straight
to
bed
she
slept
from
ten
that
night
till
the
next
morning
and
awoke
to
the
consciousness
that
the
light
of
day
was
garish
that
she
herself
was
an
insignificant
trifle
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
everything
was
unsatisfactory
now
had
i
been
the
heroine
of
a
story
she
said
to
herself
it
would
have
been
left
to
the
reader
imagination
to
suppose
that
i
remained
forever
in
the
state
of
blissful
exaltation
up
to
which
aunt
fulda
wound
me
by
her
eloquence
yesterday
here
i
am
already
however
with
my
intentions
still
set
fair
i
believe
but
in
spirit
oh
so
flat
a
siphon
of
from
which
the
gas
has
escaped
well
i
suppose
it
must
be
recharged
that
is
all
oh
dear
i
so
tired
just
five
minutes
more
angelica
dear
take
five
minutes
more
she
closed
her
eyes
glad
i
the
mistress
and
not
the
maid
am
i
though
poor
elizabeth
it
spoils
my
comfort
just
to
think
of
her
always
obliged
to
be
up
and
dressed
with
a
racking
headache
perhaps
hardly
able
to
rise
but
forced
to
drag
herself
up
somehow
nevertheless
to
wait
upon
worthless
selfish
me
live
for
others
here
however
thought
halted
grew
confused
ceased
altogether
for
an
imperceptible
interval
and
was
then
succeeded
by
vivid
dreams
she
fancied
that
she
had
wavered
in
her
new
resolutions
and
gone
back
to
her
old
idea
if
the
conditions
of
life
were
different
would
be
different
in
spirit
and
in
truth
instead
of
only
in
outward
seeming
as
now
appeared
to
be
the
case
she
was
doing
no
good
in
the
world
her
days
were
steeped
in
idleness
her
life
was
being
wasted
surely
it
would
be
a
creditable
thing
for
her
to
take
her
violin
and
make
it
what
it
was
intended
to
be
a
delight
to
thousands
such
genius
as
hers
was
never
meant
for
the
benefit
of
a
little
circle
only
but
for
the
world
at
large
and
all
she
wanted
was
to
fulfil
the
end
and
object
of
her
being
by
going
to
work
she
said
so
to
kilroy
and
he
made
no
objection
which
surprised
her
for
always
hitherto
he
had
expressed
himself
strongly
on
the
subject
even
to
the
extent
of
losing
his
temper
on
one
occasion
now
however
he
heard
her
in
silence
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
and
when
she
had
said
her
say
he
uttered
not
a
word
but
just
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
deep
sigh
almost
a
groan
and
a
look
of
weariness
and
perplexity
in
his
eyes
that
smote
her
to
the
heart
and
slowly
left
the
room
i
make
his
life
a
burden
to
him
she
said
to
herself
i
can
do
nothing
right
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
do
and
then
she
followed
him
to
the
library
he
was
sitting
at
his
writing
table
with
his
arms
folded
upon
it
and
his
face
bowed
down
and
hidden
on
them
and
he
did
not
move
when
she
entered
the
deep
dejection
of
his
attitude
frightened
her
she
hastened
to
him
knelt
down
beside
him
and
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
drew
him
toward
her
and
then
he
looked
at
her
trying
to
smile
but
a
more
miserable
face
she
had
never
beheld
o
daddy
daddy
she
cried
remorsefully
i
did
mean
to
vex
you
never
play
in
public
as
long
as
i
live
there
i
promise
you
i
do
wish
you
to
make
rash
promises
he
answered
hoarsely
but
if
you
could
care
for
me
a
little
daddy
i
do
care
for
you
i
do
indeed
she
protested
i
like
to
know
you
are
here
i
like
to
be
able
to
come
to
you
when
whenever
i
like
i
can
not
do
without
you
if
anything
happened
to
you
the
shock
of
such
a
dreadful
possibility
awoke
her
she
was
less
refreshed
than
she
had
been
when
she
first
opened
her
eyes
that
morning
but
she
sprang
out
of
bed
in
an
instant
the
blinds
were
up
and
the
windows
open
as
usual
the
sun
had
spun
round
to
the
south
and
now
streamed
hotly
in
making
her
feel
belated
elizabeth
she
called
then
went
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
standing
a
moment
when
she
had
done
so
and
looking
down
as
if
to
consider
the
blurred
reflection
of
her
bare
white
feet
on
the
polished
floor
but
only
for
an
instant
for
the
paramount
feeling
that
possessed
her
was
one
of
extreme
haste
the
painful
impression
of
that
dream
was
still
vividly
present
with
her
and
she
wanted
to
do
but
what
precisely
she
did
not
wait
to
ask
herself
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
one
duty
after
another
presented
itself
as
usual
and
equally
as
usual
with
her
in
her
own
house
was
carefully
performed
so
that
she
was
fully
occupied
until
lunch
time
but
after
lunch
she
ordered
the
carriage
and
drove
into
morningquest
to
do
some
shopping
for
the
household
this
task
accomplished
she
intended
to
return
but
as
she
passed
the
station
the
recollection
of
the
dream
of
her
husband
bowed
head
of
the
utter
misery
in
his
face
when
he
looked
up
at
her
of
the
pain
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
and
the
effort
he
made
in
his
kindly
way
to
control
it
so
that
he
might
not
hurt
her
with
an
implied
reproach
when
he
said
if
you
could
care
for
me
a
little
dear
daddy
always
so
tender
for
her
always
so
kindly
forbearing
what
was
it
the
london
express
would
go
out
in
five
minutes
it
was
the
train
he
had
gone
by
himself
last
time
how
could
she
let
him
go
alone
stop
at
the
station
write
a
line
to
elizabeth
please
pack
up
my
things
and
follow
me
to
town
immediately
get
me
a
ticket
quick
here
is
the
train
in
off
thank
heaven
angelica
threw
herself
back
in
the
centre
seat
of
the
compartment
and
closed
her
eyes
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
action
suited
her
her
lips
were
smiling
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
there
was
a
young
man
seated
opposite
to
her
who
stared
so
persistently
that
at
last
she
became
aware
of
his
admiring
gaze
and
immediately
despised
him
although
why
she
should
despise
him
for
admiring
her
she
could
not
have
told
when
he
had
left
the
carriage
a
old
quaker
lady
who
was
then
the
only
other
passenger
addressed
angelica
in
the
quaint
grammar
of
her
sect
art
thee
travelling
alone
dear
child
yes
angelica
answered
with
the
affable
smile
and
intonation
for
which
the
heavenly
twins
were
noted
doubtless
there
are
plenty
of
friends
to
meet
thee
at
thy
journey
end
the
lady
suggested
responding
sympathetically
to
angelica
pleasantness
plenty
said
angelica
not
to
mention
my
husband
when
she
had
said
it
she
felt
proud
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
because
she
had
a
husband
ah
the
lady
ejaculated
somewhat
sadly
well
she
added
betraying
her
thought
in
these
sad
days
the
sooner
a
young
girl
has
the
strong
arm
of
a
good
man
to
protect
her
the
better
then
she
folded
her
hands
and
turned
her
placid
face
to
the
window
angelica
looked
at
her
for
a
little
wondering
at
the
delicate
pink
and
white
of
her
withered
cheek
and
becoming
aware
of
a
tune
at
the
same
time
set
to
the
words
good
man
a
good
man
by
the
thundering
throbbing
crank
as
they
sped
along
daddy
was
a
good
man
she
lost
him
nobody
belonged
to
her
as
he
did
she
lost
him
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
world
to
whom
she
could
go
by
right
as
she
was
going
to
him
nobody
else
in
whom
she
had
such
perfect
confidence
nobody
on
whose
devotion
to
herself
she
could
rely
as
she
did
on
his
she
was
all
the
world
to
him
good
man
a
good
man
suppose
suppose
she
lost
him
the
sudden
dread
gripped
her
heart
painfully
it
was
not
death
she
feared
but
that
worse
loss
a
change
in
his
affection
he
was
a
simple
upright
honourable
man
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
but
need
he
ever
know
the
question
was
answered
as
soon
as
asked
for
angelica
felt
in
her
heart
that
she
could
bear
to
lose
him
and
live
alone
better
than
be
beside
him
with
that
invisible
barrier
of
a
deception
always
between
them
to
keep
them
apart
it
was
a
need
of
her
nature
to
be
known
for
what
she
was
exactly
to
those
with
whom
she
lived
the
train
drew
up
at
the
terminus
and
the
moment
she
moved
she
was
again
conscious
of
that
terrible
feeling
of
haste
which
had
beset
her
more
or
less
the
whole
day
long
no
one
to
meet
thee
the
quaker
lady
said
no
i
am
not
expected
angelica
answered
with
her
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
i
am
a
bad
wife
in
a
state
of
repentance
going
to
give
a
good
husband
an
unpleasant
surprise
she
sprang
from
the
carriage
hastened
across
the
platform
and
got
into
a
hansom
telling
the
man
to
drive
quick
quick
on
arriving
at
the
house
she
entered
unannounced
after
some
little
opposition
from
a
new
manservant
who
did
not
know
her
by
sight
and
was
evidently
inclined
to
believe
her
to
be
an
impostor
bent
on
pillage
this
check
on
the
threshold
caused
her
to
feel
deeply
humiliated
her
husband
happened
to
be
crossing
the
hall
at
the
time
but
he
went
on
without
noticing
the
arrival
at
the
door
and
she
followed
him
to
his
study
unconscious
of
her
presence
he
passed
into
the
room
before
her
with
a
heavy
step
and
as
she
noted
this
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
as
he
really
was
of
good
figure
and
quiet
undemonstrative
manners
faultlessly
dressed
distinguished
in
appearance
upon
the
whole
if
not
actually
handsome
a
man
of
position
and
means
accustomed
to
social
consideration
as
was
evident
by
his
bearing
and
not
old
as
she
was
wont
to
think
him
what
difference
did
twenty
years
make
at
respective
ages
no
not
old
but
unhappy
and
lonely
for
if
she
did
not
care
to
be
with
him
who
would
her
heart
smote
her
and
she
stepped
forward
impetuously
anxious
above
everything
to
make
amends
daddy
she
gasped
grasping
his
arm
startled
kilroy
turned
round
and
looked
down
into
her
face
incredulously
is
it
you
angelica
he
faltered
is
anything
the
matter
dear
then
suddenly
his
whole
being
changed
a
glad
light
came
into
his
eyes
making
him
look
years
younger
and
he
was
about
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
she
coldly
repulsed
him
acting
on
one
of
two
impulses
the
other
being
to
respond
to
cling
close
to
him
to
say
something
loving
there
is
nothing
the
matter
she
began
i
thought
i
should
like
to
come
back
to
you
at
least
recollecting
herself
that
is
true
but
i
do
wish
i
had
never
separated
myself
from
you
in
any
way
i
do
wish
i
had
been
different
and
she
threw
herself
into
a
low
easy
armchair
and
leant
back
looking
up
to
him
with
appealing
eyes
mr
kilroy
pride
and
affection
made
him
nicely
observant
of
any
change
in
angelica
but
still
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
new
freak
and
her
manner
alarmed
him
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
he
said
anxiously
she
sat
up
restlessly
then
threw
herself
back
in
the
chair
once
more
and
lay
there
with
her
chin
on
her
chest
in
an
utterly
dejected
attitude
not
looking
up
even
when
she
spoke
oh
i
am
well
thank
you
she
said
quite
well
then
something
has
annoyed
you
he
went
on
kindly
tell
me
what
it
is
dear
child
i
am
the
proper
person
to
come
to
when
things
go
wrong
you
know
so
tell
me
all
about
it
i
i
he
hesitated
she
so
often
snubbed
any
demonstration
of
affection
that
he
shrank
from
expressing
what
he
felt
but
another
look
at
her
convinced
him
that
there
was
little
chance
of
a
rebuff
he
remained
at
a
safe
distance
however
taking
a
chair
that
stood
beside
an
oval
table
near
to
which
he
happened
to
be
standing
newspapers
and
magazines
were
piled
up
on
the
table
and
these
he
pushed
aside
making
room
for
his
right
forearm
to
rest
on
the
cool
mahogany
on
the
polished
surface
of
which
he
kept
up
a
continual
nervous
with
the
ends
of
his
finger
nails
as
he
spoke
if
you
do
not
come
to
me
for
everything
you
want
to
whom
will
you
go
he
inquired
lamely
if
pleasantly
being
perturbed
by
the
effort
he
was
making
to
conceal
his
uneasiness
and
assume
a
cheerful
demeanour
both
at
once
and
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
you
as
you
know
i
am
sure
he
tapped
a
few
times
on
the
table
in
fact
i
should
be
only
too
glad
if
you
would
give
me
the
opportunity
tap
tap
tap
a
little
oftener
you
know
tap
tap
tap
what
i
want
to
say
is
i
should
like
you
to
consult
me
and
eh
to
ask
me
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
want
anything
advice
he
had
been
going
to
add
but
modestly
changed
the
word
money
for
instance
and
now
his
countenance
cleared
he
thought
he
had
accidentally
discovered
the
difficulty
i
expect
you
have
been
running
into
debt
eh
he
spoke
quite
playfully
so
greatly
was
he
relieved
to
think
it
was
only
that
and
you
have
been
thinking
of
me
as
a
sort
of
stern
parent
eh
who
would
storm
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
my
dear
child
you
must
do
that
you
should
never
forget
all
my
worldly
goods
i
thee
endow
i
assure
you
ever
since
i
uttered
those
words
i
have
felt
that
i
held
the
property
in
trust
for
you
and
he
had
been
going
to
add
our
children
but
sighed
instead
i
have
i
know
remonstrated
with
you
when
i
thought
you
unduly
extravagant
i
could
not
conscientiously
countenance
undue
extravagance
in
so
young
a
wife
but
still
i
hope
you
have
never
had
to
complain
of
any
want
of
liberality
on
my
part
in
in
anything
in
fact
what
is
the
good
of
money
to
me
if
you
do
not
care
to
spend
it
come
now
how
much
is
it
this
time
just
tell
me
and
have
done
with
it
and
then
we
will
go
somewhere
or
make
plans
and
a
good
time
as
the
americans
call
it
i
have
a
better
box
than
usual
for
you
at
the
opera
this
year
i
think
i
told
you
and
i
never
lend
it
to
anybody
i
like
to
keep
it
empty
for
you
in
case
you
care
to
go
at
any
time
and
i
have
season
tickets
see
he
got
up
and
rummaged
in
a
drawer
until
he
found
them
for
everything
i
almost
think
i
go
sometimes
myself
just
to
see
what
is
going
on
you
know
and
if
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
would
like
so
as
to
know
what
to
take
you
to
when
you
come
and
i
accept
all
the
nice
invitations
for
you
conditionally
of
course
i
say
if
you
are
in
town
at
the
time
and
i
hope
you
may
be
which
is
true
enough
always
you
will
be
happy
to
go
or
words
to
that
effect
so
you
see
there
is
plenty
for
you
to
do
at
any
time
in
the
way
of
amusement
i
am
always
making
arrangements
it
is
like
getting
ready
to
welcome
you
when
i
am
answering
invitations
or
doing
the
theatres
i
feel
quite
as
if
i
expected
you
it
is
childish
perhaps
but
it
makes
something
to
look
forward
to
and
when
i
am
busy
preparing
for
you
somehow
the
days
do
not
seem
so
blank
angelica
felt
something
rise
in
her
throat
but
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
or
we
might
go
to
paris
he
proceeded
tentatively
shall
we
i
could
pair
with
someone
till
the
end
of
the
session
we
might
go
anywhere
in
fact
and
i
should
enjoy
a
holiday
if
if
you
would
accompany
me
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
but
the
intermittent
telick
telick
telick
of
his
nervous
drumming
on
the
table
told
that
he
was
far
from
feeling
all
the
confidence
he
assumed
for
in
truth
angelica
attitude
alarmed
him
more
and
more
on
other
occasions
when
he
had
tried
to
be
more
than
usually
kind
and
indulgent
she
had
always
called
him
a
nice
old
thing
or
made
some
such
affable
if
somewhat
patronizing
acknowledgment
even
when
she
was
out
of
temper
but
now
finding
that
he
was
waiting
for
an
answer
she
just
looked
up
at
him
once
then
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
ground
again
and
spoke
at
last
in
a
voice
so
hopeless
and
toneless
that
he
would
not
have
recognized
it
i
think
i
have
only
just
this
moment
learnt
to
appreciate
you
she
said
i
used
to
accept
all
your
kind
attentions
as
merely
my
due
but
i
know
now
how
little
i
deserve
them
and
i
wish
i
could
be
different
i
wish
i
could
repay
you
i
wish
i
could
undo
the
past
and
begin
all
over
again
begin
by
loving
you
as
a
wife
should
you
are
ten
thousand
times
too
good
for
me
yet
i
cared
for
you
in
a
way
she
protested
not
a
kind
way
perhaps
but
still
i
have
relied
upon
you
upon
your
friendship
i
have
felt
a
sense
of
security
in
the
certainty
of
your
affection
for
me
and
presumed
upon
it
o
daddy
why
have
you
let
me
do
as
i
like
kilroy
face
became
rigid
and
the
fingers
with
which
he
had
kept
up
that
intermittent
tapping
on
the
table
turned
cold
what
do
you
mean
angelica
he
asked
hoarsely
are
you
in
earnest
have
you
done
anything
or
are
you
only
tormenting
me
if
you
are
it
is
hard
you
know
i
do
care
for
you
i
always
have
done
and
i
have
never
ceased
to
look
forward
to
a
time
when
you
would
love
me
too
god
help
me
if
you
have
come
to
tell
me
that
that
time
will
never
come
again
that
lump
rose
in
angelica
throat
a
horrible
form
of
emotion
had
seized
upon
her
i
had
better
tell
you
and
get
it
over
she
said
speaking
in
hurried
gasps
and
sitting
up
but
not
looking
at
him
you
will
care
less
when
you
know
exactly
you
will
see
then
that
i
am
not
worth
a
thought
i
am
suffering
horribly
i
want
to
she
tore
her
jacket
open
and
threw
her
hat
on
the
floor
what
a
relief
i
was
suffocating
i
do
know
where
to
begin
she
looked
up
at
him
then
stopped
short
frightened
by
the
drawn
and
haggard
look
in
his
face
and
tranquillised
too
forgetting
herself
in
the
effort
to
think
of
something
to
say
to
relieve
him
but
you
do
know
all
about
it
she
added
speaking
more
naturally
than
she
had
done
yet
i
told
you
told
me
about
about
you
thought
i
was
inventing
it
that
story
about
the
tenor
and
the
boy
kilroy
curved
his
fingers
together
and
held
them
up
over
the
table
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
about
to
tap
upon
it
again
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
asked
a
question
it
was
all
true
angelica
proceeded
all
that
i
told
you
but
there
was
more
kilroy
uttered
a
low
exclamation
and
hung
his
head
as
if
in
shame
the
colour
had
fled
from
his
face
leaving
it
ghastly
gray
for
a
moment
like
that
of
a
dead
man
angelica
half
rose
to
go
to
him
fearing
he
would
faint
but
he
had
recovered
before
she
could
carry
out
her
intention
she
looked
at
him
compassionately
she
would
have
given
her
life
to
be
able
to
spare
him
now
but
it
was
too
late
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
on
and
get
it
over
you
remember
the
picture
i
had
painted
kilroy
made
a
gesture
of
assent
that
was
his
portrait
i
always
understood
it
was
an
ideal
singer
an
singer
was
what
i
said
but
it
was
not
even
that
as
you
would
have
seen
for
yourself
if
you
had
ever
gone
to
the
cathedral
it
is
a
good
likeness
nothing
more
and
you
had
yourself
put
into
a
picture
with
a
common
tenor
and
exhibited
to
all
the
world
yes
and
all
the
world
thought
it
a
great
condescension
but
he
did
not
consent
to
it
or
sit
for
it
he
objected
to
the
picture
as
strongly
as
you
do
he
was
not
a
tenor
at
all
he
was
an
old
and
intimate
friend
of
uncle
dawne
and
galbraith
they
all
all
our
people
knew
him
he
was
often
at
morne
before
you
came
to
ilverthorpe
but
i
did
not
know
it
myself
until
afterward
afterward
he
questioned
i
had
better
go
on
from
where
i
left
off
she
replied
her
confidence
returning
i
told
you
about
the
accident
on
the
river
and
his
finding
out
who
i
was
and
his
contempt
for
me
and
i
told
you
i
desired
most
sincerely
to
win
his
respect
and
you
advised
me
to
go
to
him
and
endeavour
to
do
so
well
i
went
she
paused
and
kilroy
looked
hard
at
her
his
face
was
flushed
now
and
he
was
dead
she
gasped
kilroy
seemed
bewildered
i
do
understand
he
exclaimed
i
told
you
there
was
more
and
that
was
it
that
was
all
he
was
dead
she
repeated
kilroy
drew
a
deep
breath
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
feel
relieved
he
began
as
if
speaking
to
himself
yet
i
scarcely
know
what
i
expected
he
looked
down
thoughtfully
at
his
own
hand
as
it
lay
upon
the
table
he
wanted
to
say
something
more
but
his
mind
moved
slowly
and
no
words
came
at
first
he
was
obliged
to
make
a
great
effort
to
collect
himself
and
in
the
interval
he
resumed
that
irregular
tapping
upon
the
table
it
maddened
angelica
who
found
herself
forced
to
watch
and
wait
for
the
recurrence
of
the
sound
let
me
tell
you
though
let
me
finish
the
story
she
exclaimed
at
last
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
and
then
she
gave
him
every
detail
of
her
doings
since
last
they
parted
kilroy
let
his
hand
drop
on
the
table
and
listened
without
looking
at
her
and
that
is
all
he
said
when
she
had
finished
i
mean
have
you
really
told
me
all
angelica
she
met
his
eyes
fearlessly
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
something
innocent
an
unsuspicious
look
of
inquiry
such
as
a
child
assumes
when
it
waits
to
be
questioned
which
would
have
made
him
ashamed
of
a
degrading
doubt
had
he
entertained
one
you
were
not
you
did
not
care
for
him
oh
yes
she
exclaimed
with
most
perfect
and
reassuring
candour
i
cared
for
him
of
course
i
cared
for
him
have
i
told
you
no
one
could
know
such
a
man
and
not
care
for
him
thank
god
he
said
softly
with
tremulous
lips
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
if
he
had
not
been
such
a
man
the
words
brought
down
upon
him
one
of
angelica
of
unreasonable
wrath
are
you
insinuating
that
my
good
conduct
depended
upon
his
good
character
she
demanded
are
you
no
better
than
those
hateful
french
people
who
have
no
conception
of
anything
unusual
in
a
woman
that
does
not
end
in
gross
impropriety
of
conduct
and
fill
their
books
with
nothing
else
kilroy
face
flushed
such
an
unworthy
suspicion
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
in
connection
with
yourself
he
said
at
the
risk
of
appearing
ungenerous
i
must
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
you
yourself
who
have
been
the
first
to
allude
to
the
bare
possibility
of
such
a
thing
for
my
own
part
if
you
chose
to
travel
round
the
world
alone
with
a
man
at
night
or
at
any
other
time
that
suited
your
convenience
i
should
be
content
to
know
that
you
were
doing
so
especially
if
it
amused
you
such
is
my
perfect
confidence
in
your
integrity
and
in
the
discretion
with
which
you
choose
your
friends
i
beg
your
pardon
forgive
me
angelica
humbly
ejaculated
you
shame
me
by
a
delicacy
which
i
can
only
respect
and
admire
in
you
i
can
not
imitate
it
it
is
beyond
me
i
owe
an
apology
he
answered
i
should
have
spoken
plainly
it
was
your
feelings
your
heart
not
your
conduct
that
i
suspected
you
have
never
pretended
to
love
be
in
love
with
me
and
your
tenor
was
a
younger

and
more
attractive

to
me
angelica
hastily
and
sincerely
asseverated
she
did
not
look
up
to
see
the
effect
of
her
words
upon
kilroy
her
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
his
feet
as
she
spoke
and
now
it
struck
her
that
they
were
exceedingly
feet
and
in
the
quiet
way
characteristic
of
the
man
everything
about
him
was
unobtrusive
as
his
own
manner
but
good
as
his
own
heart
angelica
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
a
long
silence
ensued
during
which
she
lapsed
into
her
old
attitude
lying
back
in
her
chair
her
hands
on
the
arms
her
chin
on
her
chest
her
wandering
glance
upon
the
ground
so
that
she
did
not
see
that
her
husband
was
watching
her
with
eyes
that
filled
as
he
looked
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
should
she
lose
his
affection
would
she
be
turned
out
of
the
kind
heart
that
had
loved
her
with
all
her
faults
and
cherished
her
with
a
patient
enduring
fondness
that
was
worth
more
and
had
been
a
greater
comfort
to
her
as
she
knew
now
than
all
the
things
together
youth
beauty
rank
wealth
and
talents
for
which
she
was
envied
if
he
said
to
her
in
his
gentle
way
you
had
better
return
to
ilverthorpe
and
live
there
which
would
mean
that
he
cared
for
her
no
longer
should
she
go
yes
she
would
go
without
a
word
she
would
go
and
drown
herself
but
kilroy
was
far
from
thinking
harsh
thoughts
of
her
on
the
contrary
he
was
blaming
himself
little
as
he
deserved
it
for
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
angelica
to
this
bitter
moment
of
he
was
not
eloquent
either
in
thought
or
speech
and
with
regard
to
his
wife
he
had
always
felt
more
than
he
could
express
even
to
himself
though
what
he
felt
did
find
a
certain
form
of
expression
intelligible
enough
to
a
loving
soul
in
his
constant
care
for
her
and
in
the
uncomplaining
devotion
which
led
him
to
sacrifice
his
own
wishes
to
her
whims
to
absent
himself
when
he
perceived
that
she
did
not
want
him
and
to
suffer
her
neglect
without
bitterness
though
certainly
not
without
pain
and
now
he
never
thought
of
blaming
her
what
occurred
to
him
was
that
this
young
girl
had
been
committed
to
his
care
and
left
by
him
pretty
much
to
her
own
devices
he
had
not
done
his
duty
by
her
he
had
not
influenced
her
in
any
way
he
had
expected
too
much
from
her
it
was
the
old
story
had
he
not
himself
seen
fifty
households
wrecked
because
the
husband
when
he
took
a
girl
little
more
than
a
child
in
years
and
quite
a
child
in
mind
and
experience
from
her
own
family
and
the
wholesome
influences
and
companionship
of
father
mother
brothers
sisters
probably
left
her
to
go
unguided
to
form
her
character
as
best
she
could
putting
that
grave
responsibility
in
her
own
weak
hands
as
if
the
mere
making
a
wife
of
her
must
make
her
a
mature
and
sensible
woman
also
this
was
what
he
had
done
himself
and
if
angelica
had
got
into
bad
hands
and
come
to
grief
irreparable
there
would
have
been
nobody
to
blame
but
himself
for
it
especially
as
he
knew
she
was
headstrong
excitable
wild
original
fearless
and
with
an
intellect
large
out
of
all
proportion
for
the
requirements
of
the
life
to
which
society
condemned
her
a
force
which
was
liable
if
otherwise
unemployed
to
expend
itself
in
outbursts
of
mischievous
energy
although
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
vice
in
her
no
not
a
scrap
he
loyally
insisted
for
just
look
how
she
had
come
to
him
and
told
him
would
a
girl
who
was
not
honest
at
heart
have
done
that
when
she
might
so
easily
have
deceived
him
it
was
this
confidence
which
touched
him
more
than
anything
she
had
come
to
him
as
she
should
have
done
the
first
thing
and
she
had
come
full
of
remorse
and
willing
to
atone
all
this
trouble
was
tending
to
unite
them
it
had
brought
her
home
it
would
prove
what
is
called
a
blessing
in
disguise
after
all
he
hoped
his
great
love
inspired
him
with
insight
and
taught
him
tact
in
all
his
dealings
with
angelica
and
now
it
prompted
him
to
do
the
one
wise
simple
thing
that
would
avail
under
the
circumstances
he
went
to
her
and
bending
over
her
always
delicately
considerate
of
her
inclinations
even
in
the
matter
of
the
least
caress
laid
a
kind
hand
on
her
shoulder
uttering
at
the
same
time
brokenly
the
very
words
of
her
dream
that
morning
if
you
could
care
for
me
a
little
angelica
she
looked
up
amazed
at
first
then
understanding
she
rose
the
distressing
tension
relaxed
in
that
moment
her
heart
expanded
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
overflowed
she
could
not
command
her
voice
to
speak
but
she
threw
herself
impetuously
into
her
husband
arms
and
kissed
him
passionately
and
clung
to
him
until
she
was
able
to
sob
out

let
me

sc
ii
the
fact
that
galbraith
had
not
the
advantage
of
knowing
evadne
early
history
when
they
first
became
acquainted
adds
a
certain
piquancy
to
the
flavour
of
his
impressions
and
the
reader
better
informed
than
himself
with
regard
to
the
antecedents
of
his

will
find
it
interesting
to
note
both
the
accuracy
of
his
insight
and
the
curious
mistakes
which
it
is
possible
even
for
a
trained
observer
like
himself
to
make
by
the
half
light
of
such
imperfect
knowledge
as
he
was
able
to
collect
under
the
circumstances
his
record
which
is
minute
in
all
important
particulars
is
specially
valuable
for
the
way
in
which
it
makes
apparent
the
changes
of
habit
and
opinion
and
the
modifications
of
character
that
had
been
brought
about
in
a
very
short
time
by
the
restriction
colonel
colquhoun
had
imposed
upon
her
in
some
respects
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
she
is
the
same
person
but
more
interesting
still
perhaps
are
the
glimpses
we
get
of
galbraith
himself
in
the
narrative
throughout
which
it
is
easy
to
decipher
the
simple
earnestness
of
the
man
the
cautious
professionalism
and
integrity
the
touches
of
tender
sentiment
held
in
check
the
dash
of
egotism
the
human
nature
the
capacity
for
enjoyment
and
sorrow
the
love
of
life
and
above
all
the
perfect
unconsciousness
with
which
he
shows
himself
to
have
been
a
man
of
fastidious
refinement
and
exemplary
moral
strength
and
delicacy
of
the
highest
possible
character
and
most
lovable
in
spite
of
a
somewhat
irascible
temper
and
manner
which
were
apt
to
be
abrupt
at
times
chapter
evadne
puzzled
me
as
a
rule
men
of
my
profession
and
more
particularly
specialists
like
myself
can
class
a
woman
character
and
gauge
her
propensities
for
good
or
evil
while
he
is
diagnosing
her
disease
if
she
consult
him
or
more
easily
still
during
half
an
hour
ordinary
conversation
if
he
happens
to
be
alone
with
her
but
even
after
i
had
seen
evadne
many
times
and
felt
broadly
that
i
knew
her
salient
points
as
well
as
such
tricks
of
manner
or
habitual
turns
of
expression
as
distinguished
her
from
other
ladies
i
was
puzzled
we
are
not
sufficiently
interested
in
all
the
people
we
meet
to
care
to
understand
their
characters
exactly
but
a
medical
man
who
has
not
insight
enough
to
do
so
at
will
has
small
chance
of
success
in
his
profession
and
when
i
found
myself
puzzled
about
evadne
it
became
a
point
of
importance
with
me
to
understand
her
she
was
certainly
an
interesting
study
and
all
the
more
so
because
of
that
initial
difficulty
a
difficulty
by
the
way
which
i
found
from
the
gossip
of
the
place
that
everybody
else
was
experiencing
more
or
less
for
it
was
evident
from
the
first
that
whatever
her
real
character
might
be
she
was
anything
but
a
nonentity
before
she
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
a
fortnight
she
had
made
a
distinct
impression
and
was
freely
discussed
a
fact
which
speaks
for
itself
in
two
ways
first
her
individuality
was
strongly
marked
enough
to
attract
immediate
attention
and
secondly
there
was
that
about
her
which
provoked
criticism
not
that
the
criticism
of
a
community
like
ours
is
worth
much
consisting
as
it
does
of
carping
mainly
and
the
kind
of
carping
which
reflects
much
more
upon
the
low
level
of
intelligence
that
obtains
in
such
neighbourhoods
than
upon
the
character
of
the
person
criticised
for
what
the
vulgar
do
not
understand
they
are
apt
to
condemn
somebody
has
said
that
to
praise
moderately
is
a
sign
of
mediocrity
and
somebody
might
have
added
that
to
denounce
decidedly
shows
deficiency
in
a
multitude
of
estimable
qualities
among
which
discernment
must
be
specially
mentioned
not
however
that
there
was
any
question
of
denouncing
here
for
evadne
was
always
more
discussed
for
what
she
was
not
than
for
what
she
was
one
lady
of
my
acquaintance
put
part
of
my
own
feeling
into
words
when
she
declared
that
evadne
be
nicer
if
that
part
of
it
which
first
made
me
suspect
that
there
was
something
artificial
in
her
attitude
towards
the
world
at
large
and
more
especially
towards
the
world
of
thought
and
opinion
and
that
had
she
been
natural
she
would
have
differed
from
herself
as
we
knew
her
in
many
material
respects
naturalness
however
is
a
quality
upon
which
too
much
stress
is
generally
laid
if
you
are
naturally
nice
it
is
all
very
well
but
suppose
you
are
naturally
nasty
we
should
be
very
thankful
indeed
to
think
that
some
of
our
friends
are
not
natural
in
looking
back
now
i
am
inclined
to
ask
why
we
evadne
intimate
friends
should
always
have
expected
more
of
her
than
we
did
of
other
people
that
certainly
was
the
case
and
she
disappointed
us
we
felt
that
she
should
have
been
a
representative
woman
such
as
the
world
wants
at
this
period
of
its
progress
making
a
name
for
herself
and
an
impression
on
the
age
and
it
was
probably
her
objection
expressed
with
quite
passionate
earnestness
to
play
a
part
in
which
we
gathered
from
many
chance
indications
that
she
was
eminently
qualified
to
have
excelled
that
constituted
the
puzzle
her
natural
bent
was
certainly
in
that
direction
but
something
had
changed
it
and
here
in
particular
the
external
tormenting
difficulty
with
regard
to
her
occurred
with
full
force
at
a
very
early
period
of
our
acquaintance
however
i
discovered
that
her
attitude
in
this
respect
was
not
inherent
but
deliberately
chosen
i
avoid
questions
of
the
day
as
much
as
possible
she
said
on
one
occasion
in
answer
to
some
remark
of
mine
on
a
current
topic
of
conversation
i
do
not
as
a
rule
read
anything
on
such
subjects
and
if
people
begin
to
discuss
them
in
my
presence
i
fly
if
i
can
i
should
have
thought
that
all
such
questions
would
have
interested
you
deeply
i
observed
they
seem
to
possess
a
quite
fatal
fascination
for
people
who
allow
themselves
to
be
interested
she
answered
evasively
and
in
a
tone
which
forbade
further
discussion
of
the
subject
but
it
was
the
evasion
which
enlightened
me
she
would
not
have
been
afraid
of
the
fatal
fascination
if
she
had
never
felt
it
herself
and
it
was
therefore
evident
that
her
objection
was
not
the
outcome
of
ignorant
prejudice
but
of
knowledge
and
set
purpose
it
was
the
attitude
of
a
burnt
child
the
impression
she
made
upon
the
neighbourhood
was
curious
in
one
way
it
was
so
very
mixed
in
the
adverse
part
of
the
mixture
however
a
good
deal
of
personal
pique
was
apparent
and
one
thing
was
always
obvious
people
liked
her
as
much
as
she
would
let
them
she
even
might
have
been
popular
had
she
chosen
but
popularity
comes
of
condescending
to
the
level
of
the
average
and
evadne
was
exclusive
she
was
vraie
petite
grande
at
heart
as
well
as
in
appearance
and
would
associate
with
none
but
her
equals
and
out
of
those
again
she
was
fastidious
in
the
selection
of
her
friends
to
servants
people
who
knew
their
proper
place
and
retainers
generally
with
legitimate
claims
to
her
consideration
she
was
all
kindly
courtesy
and
they
were
devoted
to
her
but
she
met
the
aspiring
parvenu
seeking
her
acquaintance
on
false
pretences
of
equality
with
that
disdainful
civility
which
is
more
exasperating
than
positive
rudeness
because
a
lady
is
only
rude
to
her
equals
and
hence
most
of
the
animadversion
but
her
manner
was
perfectly
consistent
her
coldness
or
cordiality
to
mere
acquaintances
only
varied
of
necessity
according
to
her
position
and
responsibilities
in
her
own
house
where
the
onus
of
entertaining
fell
upon
her
she
was
charming
to
everybody
neglecting
none
and
giving
an
equally
flattering
share
of
her
attention
to
each
but
if
she
met
the
same
people
at
somebody
else
place
when
she
was
off
duty
as
it
were
she
certainly
showed
no
more
interest
than
she
felt
in
them
i
do
not
believe
however
that
she
ever
committed
a
breach
of
good
manners
in
her
life
when
she
spoke
to
you
she
did
so
with
the
most
perfect
manner
giving
you
her
whole
attention
for
the
moment
and
never
letting
her
eyes
wander
as
underbred
people
so
often
do
especially
in
the
act
of
shaking
hands
fairly
considered
her
attitude
in
society
was
distinguished
by
an
equable
politeness
in
which
however
there
was
no
heart
and
that
was
what
the
world
missed
she
did
not
care
for
society
and
society
demands
your
heart
having
none
of
its
own
she
certainly
did
her
duty
in
that
state
of
life
but
without
any
affectation
of
delight
in
it
she
went
to
all
the
local
entertainments
as
custom
required
and
suffered
from
suspended
animation
under
the
influence
of
the
deadly
dulness
which
prevailed
at
most
of
them
but
in
that
she
was
not
peculiar
and
she
could
conceal
her
boredom
more
successfully
than
almost
anybody
else
i
knew
and
did
so
heroically
in
her
religion
too
she
was
quite
conventional
like
most
people
in
these
days
she
was
a
good
churchwoman
without
being
in
any
sense
a
christian
she
did
not
love
her
neighbour
as
herself
or
profess
to
but
she
went
to
church
regularly
and
made
all
the
responses
pleasing
the
clergy
and
deriving
some
solace
herself
from
the
occupation
at
least
she
always
said
the
services
were
soothing
she
was
genuinely
shocked
by
a
sign
of
irreverence
and
would
sing
the
most
jingling
nonsense
as
a
hymn
with
perfect
gravity
and
without
perceiving
that
there
was
any
flaw
in
it
in
these
matters
she
showed
no
originality
at
all
she
would
repeat
my
duty
towards
my
neighbour
is
to
love
him
as
myself
and
to
do
to
all
men
as
i
would
that
they
should
do
unto
me
fervently
and
come
out
and
cut
chrimes
to
the
quick
just
afterward
because
she
had
the
misfortune
to
be
a
tanner
wife
and
nobody
daughter
in
particular
it
was
what
she
had
been
taught
any
one
of
her
set
would
have
said
my
duty
to
my
neighbour
without
a
doubt
of
their
own
sincerity
and
given
chrimes
the
cold
shoulder
too
the
inconsistency
is
customary
and
in
this
particular
evadne
was
as
much
a
creature
of
custom
as
the
rest
it
was
my
fate
to
take
evadne
in
to
dinner
on
the
first
occasion
of
our
meeting
i
did
not
hear
her
name
when
i
was
presented
and
had
no
idea
who
she
was
but
i
was
struck
by
her
appearance
her
figure
was
fragile
to
a
fault
and
she
was
evidently
delicate
at
that
time
not
having
fully
recovered
as
i
was
afterwards
told
from
a
severe
attack
of
maltese
fever
but
her
complexion
was
not
unhealthy
her
features
were
refined
and
exquisitely
feminine
she
looked
about
twenty
and
her
face
in
repose
would
have
been
expressionless
but
for
the
slight
changes
about
the
mouth
which
showed
that
the
mind
was
working
within
her
long
eyes
seemed
narrow
from
a
trick
she
had
of
holding
them
half
shut
they
were
and
steadfast
and
all
her
movements
struck
one
at
first
as
being
languid
but
that
impression
wore
off
after
a
time
and
then
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
merely
rather
more
deliberate
than
is
usual
with
a
girl
she
answered
my
first
remarks
somewhat
shortly
but
certainly
such
observations
as
one
finds
to
make
to
a
strange
lady
while
taking
her
from
the
drawing
room
to
the
dining
room
and
arranging
her
chair
at
table
are
not
usually
calculated
to
inspire
brilliant
responses
she
had
the
habit
of
society
to
perfection
and
was
essentially
but
i
fancied
she
was
shy
coldness
is
often
a
cover
for
extreme
shyness
in
women
of
her
station
and
i
did
my
best
to
thaw
her
but
the
soup
and
fish
had
been
removed
and
we
had
arrived
at
the
last
before
i
made
a
remark
that
roused
her
in
the
least
i
forget
what
i
said
exactly
but
it
was
some
stupid
commonplace
about
the
difficulties
of
the
political
situation
at
the
moment
i
hate
politics
she
then
observed
business
is
a
disagreeable
thing
whether
it
be
the
business
of
the
nation
or
of
the
shop
i
hear
women
say
that
they
are
obliged
to
interfere
just
now
in
all
that
concerns
themselves
because
men
have
cheated
and
imposed
upon
them
to
a
quite
unbearable
extent
but
they
will
do
no
good
by
it
their
position
is
perfectly
hopeless
and
the
mere
trade
of
governing
is
a
coarse
pursuit
and
therefore
most
objectionable
for
us
she
drew
in
her
breath
and
tightened
her
lips
but
for
myself
she
added
what
i
object
to
mainly
is
the
thought
why
are
they
trying
to
make
us
think
the
great
difficulty
is
not
to
think
there
are
plenty
of
men
to
think
for
us
and
while
they
are
thinking
we
can
be
feeling
i
for
one
have
no
joy
in
eventful
living
feeling
is
life
not
thought
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
give
us
the
suffrage
she
broke
off
with
the
first
glimpse
of
a
smile
i
had
seen
on
her
lips
after
the
excitement
of
conquering
your
opposition
to
it
was
over
we
should
all
be
content
and
not
one
woman
in
a
hundred
would
trouble
herself
to
vote
i
believe
women
are
more
public
spirited
than
that
i
answered
they
are
toiling
everywhere
now
for
the
furtherance
of
all
good
works
and
they
come
forward
courageously
whenever
necessity
compels
them
to
take
such
an
extreme
and
uncongenial
course
in
times
of
war
she
had
been
leaning
back
in
her
chair
in
a
somewhat
languid
attitude
but
now
suddenly
she
straightened
herself
her
face
flushed
crimson
and
i
stopped
short
something
in
the
word
war
either
hurt
or
excited
her
her
long
eyes
opened
on
me
wide
and
bright
for
the
first
time
and
flashed
a
look
into
mine
more
stirring
than
the
wine
that
bubbled
in
the
glass
between
my
fingers
she
is
beautiful
i
said
to
myself
but
up
to
that
moment
i
had
not
suspected
it
war
she
exclaimed
speaking
under
her
breath
but
incisively
do
not
let
us
talk
about
it
war
is
the
dirty
work
of
a
nation
it
is
one
of
the
indecencies
of
life
and
should
never
be
mentioned
she
looked
straight
into
my
face
for
a
moment
with
eyes
wide
open
and
lips
compressed
when
she
had
finished
speaking
and
then
took
her
in
her
left
hand
and
began
to
study
it
with
great
apparent
attention
having
discovered
that
she
thought
politics
a
coarse
contaminating
business
and
war
the
dirty
work
of
a
nation
i
felt
curious
to
know
her
views
on
literature
and
art
i
have
just
been
reading
a
book
that
might
interest
you
i
began
it
strikes
me
as
being
so
true
to
life
i
think
i
should
be
inclined
to
avoid
it
then
she
answered
for
i
always
find
that
to
life
in
a
book
means
something
revolting
unfortunately
yes
it
often
does
i
agreed
but
still
we
ought
to
know
if
we
refused
to
study
the
bad
side
of
life
no
evil
would
ever
be
remedied
do
you
think
any
good
is
ever
done
she
asked
i
am
afraid
you
are
a
pessimist
i
rejoined
but
do
you
really
like
books
that
are
true
to
life
yourself
she
proceeded
do
you
think
we
see
enough
of
life
without
reading
about
it
for
my
own
part
i
am
grateful
to
anyone
who
has
the
power
to
take
me
out
of
this
world
and
make
me
feel
something
realise
something
beyond
the
dash
of
the
supernatural
for
instance
in
inglesant
isaacs
wizard
son
and
little
pilgrim
has
the
effect
of
rest
upon
my
mind
and
gives
me
greater
pleasure
than
the
most
perfect
picture
of
real
life
ever
presented
in
fact
my
ideal
of
perfect
bliss
in
these
days
is
to
know
nothing
and
believe
in
ghosts
this
also
was
a
comprehensive
opinion
and
i
felt
no
further
inclination
to
name
the
book
to
which
i
had
alluded
but
now
that
she
had
begun
to
respond
i
should
have
been
well
content
to
continue
the
conversation
there
was
something
so
unusual
in
most
of
her
opinions
that
i
wanted
to
hear
more
although
i
confess
that
what
she
said
interested
me
less
than
she
herself
did
before
i
could
touch
on
another
topic
however
the
ladies
left
the
table
a
big
blond
man
bald
bland
and
with
a
heavy
moustache
had
been
sitting
opposite
to
us
during
dinner
and
had
attracted
my
attention
by
the
way
he
looked
at
my
partner
from
time
to
time
it
was
a
difficult
look
to
describe
because
there
was
neither
admiration
nor
interest
in
it
approval
nor
disapproval
he
might
have
looked
at
a
block
of
wood
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
it
could
hardly
have
been
less
responsive
once
however
their
eyes
did
meet
and
then
the
glance
became
one
of
friendly
recognition
on
both
sides
but
even
after
that
he
still
continued
to
look
in
the
same
queer
way
and
it
was
this
fact
that
struck
me
as
peculiar
when
the
ladies
had
gone
i
happened
to
find
myself
beside
this
gentleman
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
who
it
was
i
had
taken
in
to
dinner
well
she
is
supposed
to
be
my
wife
he
answered
deliberately
and
i
am
colonel
colquhoun
he
spoke
with
a
decidedly
irish
accent
of
the
educated
sort
and
seemed
to
think
that
i
should
know
all
about
him
when
he
mentioned
his
name
but
i
had
never
heard
of
the
fellow
before
i
rightly
conjectured
however
that
he
was
the
new
man
who
had
come
to
command
the
depôt
at
morningquest
while
i
had
been
abroad
for
my
holiday
chapter
ii
first
impressions
are
very
precious
for
many
reasons
they
have
a
charm
of
their
own
to
begin
with
and
it
is
interesting
to
recall
them
and
salutary
also
if
not
sedative
collect
a
few
and
you
will
soon
see
clearly
the
particular
kind
of
ass
you
are
by
the
mistakes
you
have
made
in
consequence
of
having
confided
in
them
when
i
first
met
evadne
i
was
still
young
enough
in
the
opprobrious
sense
of
the
word
to
suppose
that
i
should
find
her
mentally
when
i
met
her
again
just
where
she
was
when
she
left
me
after
our
little
chat
at
the
and
i
went
to
pay
my
duty
call
upon
her
under
that
most
erroneous
impression
i
intended
to
resume
our
interrupted
conversation
and
never
doubted
but
that
i
should
find
her
willing
to
gratify
my
interest
in
her
peculiar
views
it
was
a
mistake
however
which
anybody
whose
delight
in
his
own
pursuits
is
continuous
might
make
and
one
into
which
the
cleverest
man
is
prone
to
fall
when
the
object
is
a
woman
i
called
on
evadne
the
day
after
the
dinner
she
was
alone
and
rising
from
a
seat
beside
a
small
as
i
entered
advanced
a
step
and
held
out
a
nerveless
hand
to
me
she
was
not
looking
well
her
skin
was
white
and
opaque
her
eyes
dull
her
lips
pale
and
her
apparent
age
ten
years
more
than
i
had
given
her
on
the
previous
evening
she
was
a
lamplight
beauty
i
supposed
but
her
dress
satisfied
it
was
a
long
indoor
gown
which
indicated
without
indelicacy
the
natural
lines
of
her
slender
figure
and
she
was
innocent
of
the
shocking
vulgarity
of
the
small
waist
a
common
enough
deformity
at
that
time
although
now
it
is
said
affected
by
third
rate
actresses
and
women
of
indifferent
character
only
the
waist
is
an
infallible
index
to
the
moral
worth
of
a
woman
very
little
of
the
latter
survives
the
pressure
of
a
tightened
corset
will
you
sit
there
evadne
said
indicating
an
easy
chair
and
subsiding
into
her
own
again
as
she
spoke
colonel
colquhoun
is
not
at
home
she
added
but
i
hope
he
will
return
in
time
to
see
you
he
will
be
sorry
if
he
does
not
it
was
quite
the
proper
thing
to
say
and
her
manner
was
all
that
it
ought
to
have
been
yet
somehow
the
effect
was
not
encouraging
had
i
been
inclined
to
presume
i
should
have
felt
myself
put
in
my
place
but
being
void
of
reproach
my
mind
was
free
to
take
notes
and
i
decided
that
evadne
was
a
society
woman
of
unexceptionable
form
but
ordinary
and
my
nascent
interest
was
nowhere
my
visit
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
time
she
gave
me
back
commonplace
for
commonplace
punctually
doing
damage
to
her
gown
with
a
pin
she
held
in
her
left
hand
the
while
and
only
raising
her
eyes
to
mine
for
an
instant
at
a
time
nothing
could
have
been
easier
colder
thinner
more
uninspiring
than
the
fluent
periods
with
which
she
favoured
me
and
nothing
more
stultifying
to
my
own
brain
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
pin
my
wits
must
have
wandered
as
it
was
however
she
inadvertently
forced
me
to
concentrate
my
attention
upon
the
pin
with
fears
for
her
femoral
artery
by
apparently
sticking
it
into
herself
in
a
reckless
way
whenever
there
was
a
pause
and
each
emphatic
little
dig
startled
my
imagination
into
lively
activity
and
kept
me
awake
but
altogether
the
visit
was
disappointing
and
i
left
her
under
the
impression
that
the
glimpse
of
mind
i
had
had
the
night
before
was
delusive
a
mere
transient
flash
of
intelligence
caused
by
some
swift
current
of
emotion
due
to
external
influences
of
which
i
was
unaware
love
or
an
effervescent
wine
will
kindle
some
such
spark
in
the
dullest
but
there
was
nothing
in
evadne
manner
indicative
of
the
former
influence
and
as
to
the
latter
the
only
use
she
ever
made
of
a
wineglass
was
to
put
her
gloves
in
it
as
i
gathered
up
the
reins
to
drive
my
dogcart
home
that
afternoon
i
was
conscious
of
an
impression
on
my
mind
as
of
a
yawn
but
i
was
relieved
to
have
the
visit
over
and
done
with
as
i
at
first
believed
it
to
be
but
it
was
not
done
with
for
during
the
drive
a
thought
occurred
to
me
with
chastening
rather
than
cheering
effect
a
thought
which
proves
that
my
opinion
of
evadne
capacity
had
begun
to
be
mixed
even
at
that
early
period
of
our
acquaintance
i
acknowledged
to
myself
that
one
of
us
had
been
flat
that
day
and
had
infected
the
other
but
which
was
the
original
flat
one
some
minds
are
like
caves
of
stalactite
and
stalagmite
rich
in
treasures
of
beauty
the
existence
of
which
you
may
never
suspect
because
you
bring
no
light
yourself
to
dispel
the
darkness
that
conceals
them
chapter
iii
the
next
time
i
saw
evadne
it
was
at
her
own
house
also
and
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
my
first
visit
i
was
driving
past
but
encountered
colonel
colquhoun
at
the
gate
and
pulled
up
for
politeness
sake
as
i
had
not
seen
him
when
i
called
he
was
returning
from
barracks
in
a
jovial
mood
and
made
such
a
point
of
my
going
in
that
i
felt
obliged
to
we
found
evadne
alone
in
the
drawing
room
and
i
noticed
to
my
surprise
that
she
was
extremely
nervous
her
manner
was
but
her
hands
betrayed
her
she
fidgeted
with
her
rings
or
her
buttons
or
her
fingers
incessantly
and
certainly
was
relieved
when
i
rose
to
go
the
little
she
said
however
impressed
me
and
i
would
gladly
have
stayed
to
hear
more
had
she
wished
it
i
fancied
however
that
she
did
not
wish
it
and
i
accordingly
took
my
leave
as
soon
as
i
decently
could
as
i
drove
home
i
found
myself
revising
my
revised
opinion
of
her
i
felt
sure
now
that
she
was
something
more
than
an
ordinary
society
woman
still
like
everybody
else
at
that
time
i
could
not
have
said
whether
i
liked
or
disliked
her
but
i
wanted
to
see
her
again
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
however
i
received
a
request
with
regard
to
her
which
developed
my
latent
curiosity
into
honest
interest
and
added
a
certain
sense
of
duty
to
my
half
formed
wish
to
know
more
of
her
the
request
arrived
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
from
lady
adeline
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
and
one
who
has
always
had
my
most
sincere
respect
and
affection
she
is
a
woman
who
lives
altogether
for
others
devoting
the
greater
part
of
her
ample
means
and
all
the
influence
of
an
excellent
position
to
their
service
and
she
is
a
woman
who
stands
alone
on
the
strength
of
her
own
individuality
for
does
not
count
her
great
charm
is
her
perfect
sincerity
she
is
essentially
true
when
i
saw
her
note
on
the
breakfast
table
next
day
i
knew
that
somehow
it
would
prove
to
be
of
more
importance
than
the
whole
of
my
other
letters
put
together
and
i
therefore
hastened
to
open
it
first
villa
mignonne
march
colonel
colquhoun
late
of
the
colqohoun
highlanders
has
been
appointed
to
command
the
depôt
at
morningquest
i
hear
kindly
make
his
acquaintance
at
your
earliest
convenience
to
oblige
me
she
is
one
of
the
fraylings
of
fraylingay
her
mother
is
a
sister
of
orton
beg
and
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
i
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
colquhoun
up
to
the
time
that
she
met
her
husband
and
she
was
then
a
charming
girl
quiet
but
clever
i
lost
sight
of
her
after
her
marriage
however
for
about
two
years
and
only
met
her
again
last
january
in
paris
when
i
found
her
changed
beyond
all
knowing
of
her
and
i
ca
think
why
she
is
not
on
good
terms
with
her
own
people
for
some
mysterious
reason
but
apart
from
that
she
seems
to
have
everything
in
the
world
she
can
want
and
makes
quite
a
boast
of
her
husband
kindness
and
consideration
i
noticed
that
she
did
not
get
on
well
with
men
as
a
rule
and
she
may
repel
you
at
first
but
persevere
for
she
be
fascinating
and
to
both
sexes
too
which
is
rare
but
i
am
told
that
people
who
begin
by
disliking
often
end
by
adoring
her
people
with
anything
in
them
i
mean
for
as
i
have
learnt
to
observe
under
your
able
tuition
the
majority
do
despitefully
by
what
it
can
not
comprehend
and
that
is
why
i
am
writing
to
you
i
am
afraid
evadne
will
come
into
collision
with
some
of
the
prejudices
of
our
enlightened
neighbourhood
she
is
not
perfect
and
nothing
but
perfection
is
good
enough
for
certain
angelic
women
of
our
acquaintance
they
will
call
her
very
character
in
question
at
the
trial
tribunals
of
their
if
she
be
as
i
think
of
the
kind
who
cause
comment
and
they
will
throw
stones
at
her
and
make
her
suffer
even
if
they
do
her
no
permanent
injury
for
i
fear
that
she
is
nervously
sensitive
both
to
praise
and
blame
a
woman
to
be
hurt
inevitably
in
this
battle
of
life
and
a
complex
character
which
i
own
i
do
not
perfectly
comprehend
myself
yet
perhaps
because
parts
of
it
are
still
nebulous
but
doubtless
your
keener
insight
will
detect
what
is
obscure
to
me
and
i
rely
upon
you
to
befriend
her
until
my
return
to
england
when
i
hope
to
be
able
to
relieve
you
of
all
responsibility
tell
me
too
how
you
get
on
with
colonel
colquhoun
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
them
both
adeline
my
answer
to
this
letter
has
lately
come
into
my
possession
and
i
give
it
as
being
of
more
value
probably
than
any
subsequent
record
of
these
early
impressions
fountain
towers
march
my
dear
lady
adeline
i
had
made
colquhoun
acquaintance
before
i
received
your
letter
and
have
seen
her
three
times
altogether
and
three
times
has
not
been
enough
to
enable
me
to
form
a
decided
opinion
of
her
character
which
seems
to
be
out
of
the
common
had
you
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
her
after
our
first
meeting
i
should
have
said
she
is
peculiar
after
the
second
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
presumed
to
say
not
but
now
after
the
third
i
am
prepared
to
maintain
that
she
is
decidedly
interesting
her
manner
is
just
a
trifle
stiff
to
begin
with
but
that
is
so
evidently
the
outcome
of
shyness
that
i
can
not
understand
anybody
being
repelled
by
it
her
voice
is
charming
every
tone
is
exquisitely
modulated
and
she
expresses
herself
with
ease
and
with
a
certain
grace
of
diction
peculiarly
her
own
it
is
a
treat
to
hear
english
spoken
as
she
speaks
it
she
uses
little
or
no
slang
and
few
abbreviations
but
she
is
perfectly
fearless
in
her
choice
of
words
and
invariably
employs
the
one
which
expresses
her
meaning
best
however
strong
it
may
be
yet
somehow
the
effect
is
never
coarse
yesterday
she
wanted
to
know
the
name
of
an
officer
now
at
the
barracks
and
made
her
husband
understand
which
she
meant
in
this
way
is
a
little
man
she
said
puts
his
hands
deep
down
in
his
pockets
hunches
up
his
shoulders
and
says
emphatically
how
she
can
use
such
words
without
offence
is
a
mystery
but
she
certainly
does
all
this
however
you
must
have
observed
for
yourself
and
i
know
that
it
is
merely
skimming
about
your
question
not
answering
it
but
i
humbly
confess
though
it
cost
me
your
confidence
in
my
insight
forever
that
i
can
not
answer
it
so
far
colquhoun
has
appealed
to
me
merely
as
a
text
upon
which
to
hang
conclusions
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
she
is
but
i
can
see
already
what
she
will
become
if
her
friends
are
not
careful
and
that
is
a
colonel
colquhoun
is
likely
to
be
a
greater
favourite
here
than
his
wife
ladies
say
he
is
nice
genial
and
irishman
whatever
they
mean
by
that
he
does
affect
both
brogue
and
blarney
when
he
thinks
proper
perhaps
however
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
that
i
do
not
like
him
and
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
he
strikes
me
as
being
a
very
commonplace
kind
of
military
man
idle
and
unintellectual
and
in
the
habit
of
filling
up
every
interval
of
life
with
brandy
and
soda
water
the
creature
is
rapidly
becoming
extinct
but
specimens
still
linger
in
certain
districts
and
i
should
judge
him
upon
the
whole
to
be
the
sort
of
man
who
pleases
by
his
good
manners
those
whom
he
does
not
repel
by
his
pet
vices
most
people
that
is
to
say
the
world
is
constant
and
kind
to
its
own
they
are
at
the
gloomiest
house
in
the
neighbourhood
i
fancy
colonel
colquhoun
took
it
to
suit
his
own
convenience
without
consulting
his
wife
tastes
or
requirements
and
he
will
be
out
too
much
to
suffer
himself
but
i
fear
she
will
feel
it
she
is
a
fragile
little
creature
for
whose
health
and
generally
i
should
say
that
bright
rooms
and
fresh
air
are
essential
the
air
at
is
not
bad
but
the
rooms
are
damp
that
west
window
in
the
drawing
room
is
the
one
bright
spot
in
the
house
and
the
sun
only
shines
on
it
in
the
afternoon
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
answer
your
letter
more
satisfactorily
but
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
colquhoun
any
service
in
my
power
diavolo
wrote
and
told
me
the
other
day
that
his
colonel
thinks
him
too
good
for
the
guards
and
has
strongly
advised
him
if
he
wishes
to
continue
in
the
service
to
exchange
into
some
other
regiment
i
have
asked
him
to
come
and
stay
with
me
and
hope
to
discover
what
he
has
been
up
to
with
your
permission
i
should
urge
him
to
apply
for
the
depôt
at
morningquest
it
would
do
the
duke
good
to
have
him
about
again
and
angelica
would
be
delighted
and
besides
colonel
colquhoun
would
keep
his
eye
on
him
and
put
up
with
more
pranks
probably
than
those
who
know
not
joseph
angelica
is
very
well
and
happy
her
devotion
to
her
husband
continues
to
be
exemplary
and
he
has
been
enough
to
oblige
her
by
delivering
some
of
her
speeches
in
parliament
lately
with
excellent
effect
she
read
the
one
now
in
preparation
aloud
to
us
the
last
time
i
was
at
ilverthorpe
it
struck
me
as
being
extremely
able
and
eminent
for
refinement
as
well
as
for
force
kilroy
himself
was
delighted
with
it
as
indeed
he
is
with
all
that
she
does
now
he
only
interrupted
her
once
should
say
the
country
is
going
to
the
dogs
there
he
suggested
i
am
afraid
your
originality
would
provoke
criticism
angelica
answered
when
do
you
return
i
avoid
hamilton
house
in
your
absence
it
looks
so
dreary
all
shut
up
yours
always
dear
lady

george
beton

chapter
iv
having
despatched
my
letter
i
began
to
consider
how
i
might
best
follow
up
my
acquaintance
with
evadne
with
a
view
to
such
intimacy
as
should
enable
me
at
any
time
to
have
the
right
to
be
of
service
to
her
should
occasion
offer
and
during
the
day
i
arranged
a
dinner
party
for
her
special
benefit
not
a
very
original
idea
but
by
accident
it
answered
the
purpose
the
colquhouns
accepted
my
invitation
but
when
the
evening
arrived
evadne
came
alone
and
quite
half
an
hour
before
the
time
i
had
dressed
luckily
and
was
strolling
about
the
grounds
when
i
saw
the
carriage
drive
up
the
avenue
and
hastened
round
the
house
to
meet
her
at
the
door
the
days
are
getting
quite
long
she
said
as
i
helped
her
to
alight
then
glancing
up
at
a
clock
in
the
hall
she
happened
to
notice
the
time
is
that
clock
right
she
asked
it
is
i
answered
then
my
coachman
must
have
mistaken
the
distance
she
said
he
assured
me
that
it
would
take
an
hour
to
drive
here
but
i
shall
not
have
occasion
to
regret
the
mistake
if
you
will
let
me
see
the
house
she
added
gracefully
it
seems
to
be
a
charming
old
place
it
would
have
been
a
little
awkward
for
both
of
us
but
for
this
happy
suggestion
there
were
however
points
of
interest
enough
about
the
house
to
fill
up
a
longer
interval
even
but
i
am
forgetting
she
exclaimed
as
i
led
her
to
the
library
i
received
this
note
from
colonel
colquhoun
at
the
last
moment
he
is
detained
in
barracks
most
unfortunately
and
will
not
be
able
to
get
away
until
late
he
begs
me
to
make
you
his
apologies
i
hope
we
shall
see
him
during
the
evening
i
said
oh
yes
she
answered
he
is
sure
to
come
for
me
there
was
a
portrait
of
lady
adeline
in
the
library
and
she
noticed
it
at
once
do
you
know
the
she
asked
brightening
out
of
her
former
manner
instantly
we
are
very
old
friends
i
answered
their
place
is
next
to
mine
you
know
i
did
not
know
she
said
i
have
never
been
there
lady
adeline
knows
my
people
and
used
to
come
to
our
house
a
good
deal
at
one
time
that
is
where
i
met
her
i
like
her
very
much
and
trust
her
that
everybody
does
do
you
know
her
widowed
sister
lady
claudia
beaumont
yes
and
their
brother
lord
dawne
yes
well
he
and
i
were
at
harrow
and
oxford
and
a
common
devotion
to
the
same
social
subjects
has
kept
us
together
since
he
is
a
man
of
most
charming
manners
she
said
thoughtfully
he
is
i
answered
cordially
i
know
no
one
else
so
fastidiously
refined
without
being
a
prig
she
was
sitting
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
with
adeline
photograph
in
her
hand
and
was
silent
a
moment
looking
at
it
meditatively
you
must
know
that
eccentric
as
they
call
her
also
she
said
at
last
glancing
up
at
me
gravely
we
do
not
consider
her
eccentric
i
said
well
you
must
confess
that
she
moves
in
an
orbit
of
her
own
she
rejoined
not
alone
then
i
answered
so
many
luminaries
circle
round
her
lady
adeline
criticises
her
severely
she
ventured
with
a
touch
of
asperity
absents
out
toujours
i
answered
but
at
the
same
time
when
lady
adeline
criticises
ideala
severely
i
am
sure
she
deserves
it
her
faults
are
patent
enough
and
most
provoking
because
she
could
correct
them
if
she
would
you
do
know
her
well
no
ah
then
i
understand
why
you
do
not
like
her
she
is
not
a
person
who
shows
to
advantage
on
a
slight
acquaintance
and
in
that
she
is
just
the
reverse
of
most
people
her
faults
are
all
on
the
surface
and
appear
at
once
her
good
qualities
only
come
out
by
degrees
i
feel
reproved
evadne
answered
smiling
but
it
is
really
hard
to
believe
that
the
main
fabric
of
a
character
is
beautiful
when
one
only
sees
the
spoilt
bits
of
it
you
must
be
quite
one
of
that
clique
she
added
in
a
tone
which
expressed
what
a
pity
quite
clearly
you
are
not
interested
in
social
questions
i
ventured
on
the
contrary
she
answered
decidedly
i
hate
them
all
she
put
the
photograph
down
and
looked
round
the
room
where
does
that
door
lead
to
she
asked
indicating
one
opposite
into
my
study
then
you
do
not
study
in
the
library
no
i
read
here
for
relaxation
when
i
want
to
work
i
go
in
there
let
me
see
where
you
work
i
hesitated
for
i
kept
my
tools
there
and
i
did
not
know
what
might
be
about
it
is
professional
work
i
do
there
i
said
she
was
quick
to
see
my
meaning
oh
in
that
case
she
began
apologetically
i
am
indiscreet
forgive
me
i
have
not
realized
your
position
yet
you
see
it
is
so
anomalous
being
both
a
doctor
and
a
country
gentleman
but
what
a
dear
old
place
this
is
i
can
not
think
how
you
can
mix
up
medical
pursuits
with
the
names
of
your
ancestors
were
i
you
i
should
belong
to
the
psychical
society
only
the
material
for
that
kind
of
research
lingers
long
in
these
deep
recesses
it
is
built
up
in
thick
walls
and
concealed
behind
oak
panels
oh
how
you
be
a
doctor
here
i
am
not
a
doctor
here
i
assured
her
at
least
only
in
the
morning
when
i
make
this
my
consulting
room
i
am
glad
she
said
this
is
a
place
in
which
to
be
human
is
a
doctor
not
human
then
i
asked
a
trifle
piqued
no
she
answered
laughing
a
doctor
is
not
a
man
to
his
lady
patients
but
an
abstraction
a
kindly
abstraction
for
whom
one
sends
when
a
presence
would
be
altogether
inconvenient
if
i
am
ever
ill
i
will
send
for
you
in
the
abstract
confidently
well
i
hope
i
may
more
than
answer
your
expectations
in
that
character
i
replied
should
anything
so
unfortunate
as
sickness
or
sorrow
induce
you
to
do
me
the
favour
of
accepting
my
services
she
gave
me
one
quick
grave
glance
i
know
you
mean
it
she
said
and
i
know
you
mean
more
you
will
befriend
me
if
i
ever
want
a
friend
i
will
i
answered
thank
you
she
said
it
was
exactly
what
i
had
intended
with
regard
to
her
since
i
had
received
lady
adeline
letter
but
a
compact
entered
into
on
the
occasion
of
our
fourth
meeting
struck
me
as
sudden
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
however
at
the
moment
for
evadne
followed
up
her
thanks
with
a
question
how
do
you
come
to
have
an
abode
of
this
kind
and
be
a
doctor
also
she
asked
the
house
came
to
me
from
an
uncle
who
died
suddenly
just
after
i
had
become
a
fully
qualified
practitioner
i
told
her
but
there
is
not
income
enough
attached
to
it
to
keep
it
up
properly
and
i
wanted
to
live
here
and
i
wanted
besides
to
continue
my
professional
career
so
i
thought
i
would
try
and
make
the
one
wish
help
the
other
and
the
experiment
has
succeeded
yes
are
you
very
fond
of
your
profession
it
is
the
finest
profession
in
the
world
all
medical
men
say
that
she
remarked
smiling
well
i
can
claim
the
merit
if
it
be
a
merit
of
having
arrived
at
that
conclusion
before
i
became
eminent
she
suggested
before
i
had
taken
my
degree
i
corrected
so
you
came
and
established
yourself
as
a
doctor
in
this
old
place
she
glanced
round
meditatively
that
seems
to
surprise
you
it
is
the
dual
character
that
surprises
me
she
answered
your
practice
makes
you
a
professional
man
and
you
are
a
county
magnate
also
by
right
of
your
name
and
connections
she
evidently
knew
all
about
me
already
and
i
was
flattered
by
the
interest
she
showed
which
i
thought
special
until
i
found
that
she
was
in
the
habit
of
knowing
and
knowing
accurately
too
all
about
everyone
with
whom
she
was
brought
into
close
contact
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
find
time
for
it
all
she
continued
you
are
not
a
general
practitioner
i
believe
not
exactly
i
answered
of
course
i
never
refuse
to
attend
in
any
case
of
emergency
but
my
regular
practice
is
all
consultation
and
my
speciality
has
somehow
come
to
be
nervous
disorders
sometimes
i
have
my
house
full
of
patients
interesting
cases
which
require
close
attention
i
know
she
said
and
poor
people
who
can
not
pay
as
often
as
the
rich
who
will
give
you
anything
to
attend
them
i
should
very
much
like
you
to
believe
the
most
exaggerated
accounts
of
my
generosity
if
any
such
are
about
i
hastened
to
assure
her
but
honesty
compels
me
to
explain
that
i
benefit
by
every
case
which
i
treat
successfully
goto
you
do
not
deceive
me
she
answered
laughing
up
in
my
face
her
manner
had
quite
changed
now
she
recognized
me
as
one
of
her
own
caste
and
knew
that
however
friendly
and
familiar
she
might
be
i
should
not
presume
when
it
was
time
to
think
of
my
other
guests
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
library
until
they
had
all
arrived
it
would
be
such
an
exertion
to
have
to
explain
to
each
one
separately
how
it
is
that
i
am
here
alone
and
i
do
so
dislike
strange
people
she
added
plaintively
it
makes
me
quite
to
have
to
meet
them
and
besides
she
broke
out
laughing
as
it
is
a
new
place
perhaps
i
ought
to
try
and
make
myself
interesting
and
of
importance
to
the
inhabitants
by
coming
in
late
when
you
keep
people
waiting
for
dinner
you
do
become
of
consequence
to
them
to
their
comfort
and
then
they
think
of
you
but
not
very
charitably
under
such
circumstances
i
suggested
that
depends
she
answered
if
you
arrive
in
time
to
save
their
appetites
they
will
associate
a
pleasant
sense
of
relief
with
your
coming
which
will
make
them
think
well
of
you
for
evermore
they
mistake
the
sensation
for
an
opinion
and
as
they
like
it
they
call
it
a
good
one
she
looked
pretty
when
she
unbent
like
that
and
talked
nonsense
or
what
was
apt
to
strike
you
as
nonsensical
until
you
came
to
consider
it
for
there
was
often
a
depth
of
worldly
wisdom
and
acuteness
underlying
her
most
apparently
careless
sallies
that
surprised
you
she
lingered
long
in
the
library
so
long
that
at
first
i
felt
impatiently
that
she
might
have
remembered
that
i
had
an
appetite
as
well
as
the
strangers
within
my
gates
with
whom
it
apparently
pleased
her
to
trifle
and
i
felt
obliged
during
an
awkward
pause
to
account
for
the
delay
by
explaining
for
whom
we
were
waiting
if
she
were
in
earnest
about
wishing
to
make
a
sensation
or
attract
special
attention
to
herself
she
had
gained
her
end
for
the
moment
i
mentioned
the
name
of
colquhoun
people
began
to
speak
of
her
carefully
because
nobody
knew
as
yet
who
her
friends
might
be
but
with
interest
i
never
supposed
for
a
moment
however
that
she
was
in
earnest
there
was
something
proudly
about
her
which
forbade
all
idea
of
anything
so
paltry
as
manoeuvring
i
did
at
first
think
that
she
might
have
fallen
asleep
but
afterward
on
recollecting
that
she
was
a
nervous
subject
it
occurred
to
me
that
her
courage
might
have
failed
her
and
that
she
would
never
present
herself
to
a
whole
room
full
of
strangers
alone
excusing
myself
to
my
guests
therefore
as
best
i
could
i
went
at
last
to
the
library
and
found
that
this
latter
surmise
was
correct
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
hands
clasped
evidently
in
an
agony
of
nervous
trepidation
i
went
up
to
her
however
as
if
i
had
not
noticed
it
and
offered
her
my
arm
if
you
will
come
now
colquhoun
i
said
we
will
go
to
dinner
she
took
my
arm
without
a
word
but
i
felt
as
soon
as
she
touched
me
that
her
confidence
was
rapidly
returning
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
drawing
room
and
i
had
explained
that
colonel
colquhoun
had
been
detained
by
duty
most
unfortunately
but
colquhoun
had
been
kind
enough
to
come
nevertheless
she
had
quite
recovered
herself
and
only
a
slight
exaggeration
of
the
habitual
me
of
her
ordinary
manner
remained
in
evidence
of
her
shyness
when
we
were
seated
at
table
and
she
was
undoubtedly
at
her
ease
again
i
expected
to
see
her
vivacity
revive
but
the
nervous
crisis
had
evidently
gone
deeper
than
her
manner
and
affected
her
mood
i
had
left
her
all
life
and
animation
a
mere
girl
bent
upon
pleasure
but
with
every
evidence
of
considerable
capacity
for
the
pursuit
but
now
at
dinner
she
sat
beside
me
cold
constrained
and
listless
neither
eating
nor
interested
pretending
however
courageously
and
probably
deceiving
those
about
her
with
the
even
flow
of
polished
periods
which
she
kept
up
to
conceal
her
indifference
i
thought
perhaps
her
husband
absence
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
expected
to
see
her
brighten
up
when
he
arrived
he
did
not
come
at
all
however
and
only
once
at
table
did
she
show
any
sign
of
the
genuine
intellectual
activity
which
i
was
now
pretty
sure
was
either
concealed
or
slumbering
in
these
moods
the
sign
she
made
was
deceptive
and
probably
only
a
man
of
my
profession
accustomed
to
observe
and
often
obliged
to
judge
more
by
indications
of
emotion
than
by
words
would
have
recognized
its
true
significance
in
the
midst
of
her
chatter
she
became
suddenly
silent
and
one
might
have
been
excused
for
supposing
that
her
mind
was
weary
but
that
in
truth
was
the
moment
when
she
really
roused
herself
and
began
to
follow
the
conversation
with
close
attention
there
was
an
old
bore
of
a
doctor
at
table
that
evening
who
would
insist
on
talking
professionally
a
thing
which
does
not
often
happen
in
my
house
for
i
think
of
all
shop
ours
is
the
most
unsuitable
for
general
conversation
because
of
the
morbid
fascination
it
has
for
most
people
ladies
especially
will
listen
with
avidity
to
medical
matters
perceiving
nothing
gruesome
in
the
details
at
the
moment
but
afterward
developing
nerves
on
the
subject
and
probably
giving
the
young
practitioner
good
reason
to
regret
unwary
confidences
i
tried
to
stave
off
the
topic
but
the
of
the
majority
was
against
me
and
finally
i
found
myself
submitting
and
following
my
friend
unwholesome
lead
you
must
have
some
curious
experiences
in
your
branch
of
the
profession
especially
the
lady
on
my
left
remarked
we
do
i
said
answering
her
expectations
against
my
better
judgment
and
partly
i
think
because
this
was
the
moment
when
evadne
woke
up
i
have
had
some
myself
the
extraordinary
systems
of
fraud
and
deceit
which
are
carried
on
by
certain
patients
for
no
apparent
purpose
would
astonish
you
their
delight
is
essentially
in
the
doing
and
the
one
and
only
end
of
it
all
is
invariably
the
same
a
morbid
desire
to
excite
sympathy
by
making
themselves
interesting
i
had
one
girl
under
my
charge
for
six
months
during
which
time
she
suffered
daily
from
long
fainting
fits
and
other
distressing
symptoms
which
reduced
her
to
the
last
degree
of
emaciation
and
puzzled
me
extremely
because
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
them
her
heart
was
perfectly
sound
yet
she
would
lie
in
a
state
of
insensibility
livid
and
all
but
pulseless
by
the
hour
together
there
was
no
disease
of
any
organ
but
certain
symptoms
which
could
not
have
been
simulated
pointed
to
extensive
disorder
of
one
at
least
it
was
a
case
of
hysteria
clearly
but
no
treatment
had
the
slightest
effect
upon
her
and
fearing
for
her
life
i
took
her
at
last
to
sir
shadwell
rock
the
best
specialist
for
nervous
disorders
now
alive
he
confirmed
my
diagnosis
and
ordered
the
girl
to
be
sent
away
from
her
friends
with
a
perfect
stranger
a
hard
cold
unsympathetic
person
who
would
irritate
her
if
possible
and
she
was
not
to
be
allowed
luxuries
of
any
kind
i
had
considered
the
advisability
of
such
a
course
myself
but
the
girl
seemed
too
far
gone
for
it
and
i
own
i
never
expected
to
see
her
alive
again
after
she
went
abroad
i
heard
that
when
she
fainted
she
was
left
just
where
she
fell
to
recover
as
best
she
could
and
when
any
particular
food
disagreed
with
her
it
was
served
to
her
incessantly
until
she
professed
to
have
got
over
her
dislike
for
it
but
in
spite
of
such
heroic
treatment
she
was
not
at
that
time
any
better
then
i
lost
sight
of
her
and
had
forgotten
the
case
when
one
day
without
any
warning
whatever
she
came
into
my
consulting
room
looking
the
picture
of
health
and
happiness
and
with
a
very
fine
child
in
her
arms
suppose
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
alive
she
said
am
married
now
and
this
is
my
boy
is
he
a
beauty
and
i
am
very
happy
or
rather
i
should
be
but
for
one
thing
that
illness
of
mine
when
i
gave
you
so
much
trouble
do
mention
that
i
interrupted
thinking
she
had
come
to
overwhelm
me
with
undeserved
thanks
only
trouble
was
that
i
could
do
nothing
for
you
i
hope
you
recovered
soon
after
you
went
abroad
soon
as
i
thought
fit
she
answered
significantly
that
is
what
i
have
come
about
i
want
to
confess
i
want
to
relieve
my
mind
of
a
burden
of
deceit
doctor
i
was
never
insensible
in
one
of
those
fainting
fits
i
never
had
a
symptom
that
i
could
not
have
controlled
i
was
shamming
from
beginning
to
end
you
nearly
shammed
yourself
out
of
the
world
i
said
me
how
you
did
it
ca
tell
you
exactly
she
answered
i
wanted
to
appear
to
faint
i
just
set
my
mind
somehow
i
ca
do
it
now
that
i
am
happy
and
have
plenty
of
interests
in
life
at
that
time
i
had
nothing
to
take
me
out
of
myself
and
those
daily
doings
were
an
endless
source
of
occupation
and
entertainment
to
me
but
lately
i
have
had
qualms
of
conscience
on
the
subject
and
was
she
cured
evadne
asked
oh
yes
i
answered
there
was
no
fear
for
her
after
she
confessed
when
the
moral
consciousness
returns
in
such
cases
and
there
is
nothing
but
relief
of
mind
to
be
gained
by
confession
the
cure
is
generally
complete
but
what
could
have
been
the
motive
of
such
a
fraud
somebody
asked
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
i
answered
had
it
been
more
extensive
the
explanation
would
have
been
easier
but
as
myself
and
the
young
parents
were
her
only
audience
i
have
never
been
able
to
account
for
it
satisfactorily
i
noticed
while
i
was
speaking
that
evadne
was
thinking
the
problem
out
for
herself
she
would
not
have
given
herself
so
much
trouble
without
a
very
strong
motive
she
now
suggested
and
human
passions
are
the
strongest
motives
for
human
actions
are
they
not
of
course
i
said
but
the
question
is
what
passion
prompted
her
it
could
not
have
been
either
anger
ambition
revenge
or
jealousy
no
she
answered
in
the
tone
of
one
who
merely
arrives
at
a
logical
conclusion
and
it
must
therefore
have
been
love
she
was
in
love
with
you
and
tried
in
that
way
to
excite
your
sympathy
and
attract
your
attention
it
is
quite
evident
that
view
of
the
case
never
occurred
to
you
galbraith
lauder
observed
laughing
and
i
own
that
i
taken
aback
by
it
considerably
not
of
course
as
it
affected
myself
but
because
it
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
an
order
of
mind
totally
different
from
that
with
which
i
should
have
credited
evadne
earlier
in
the
evening
but
how
do
you
treat
these
cases
she
proceeded
is
there
any
cure
for
such
depravity
oh
yes
i
answered
confidently
they
are
being
cured
every
day
so
long
as
there
is
no
organic
disease
i
am
quite
sure
that
wholesome
surroundings
patience
and
kind
care
and
steady
moral
influence
will
do
all
that
is
necessary
the
great
thing
is
to
awaken
the
conscience
patients
who
once
feel
sincerely
that
such
courses
are
depraved
may
cure
themselves
if
they
are
not
robbed
of
their
the
most
hopeless
causes
i
have
come
from
that
class
of
people
who
give
each
other
bits
of
their
mind
very
objectionable
bits
consisting
of
vulgar
abuse
for
the
most
part
and
the
calling
of
names
that
rankle
the
operators
seem
to
derive
a
solemn
kind
of
from
the
treatment
themselves
but
it
does
for
the
patient
almost
invariably
this
led
to
a
discussion
on
bad
manners
during
which
evadne
relapsed
i
saw
the
light
go
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
showed
no
genuine
interest
in
anything
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
when
i
had
wrapped
her
up
and
seen
her
drive
away
i
somehow
felt
that
the
entertainment
had
been
a
failure
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
and
i
wondered
why
she
should
so
soon
be
bored
at
her
age
she
should
have
had
vitality
enough
in
herself
to
carry
her
through
an
evening
colonel
colquhoun
will
regret
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
come
she
said
as
she
wished
me
and
i
noticed
afterward
that
she
was
always
most
punctilious
about
such
little
formalities
she
never
omitted
any
trifle
of
etiquette
and
i
doubt
if
she
could
have
dined
without
dressing
for
dinner
chapter
colonel
colquohoun
called
next
day
himself
to
explain
his
absence
on
the
previous
evening
i
forget
what
excuse
he
made
but
it
sufficed
i
saw
evadne
too
that
same
afternoon
she
had
been
to
make
a
call
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
waiting
at
a
little
country
station
to
return
by
train
something
peculiar
in
her
attitude
attracted
my
attention
before
i
recognized
her
she
was
standing
alone
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
platform
her
slender
figure
silhouetted
with
dark
distinctness
against
the
sloping
evening
sky
she
might
have
been
waiting
anxiously
for
someone
to
come
that
way
or
she
might
have
been
waiting
for
a
train
with
tragic
purpose
she
wore
a
long
dark
green
dress
the
train
of
which
she
was
holding
up
in
her
left
hand
she
showed
no
surprise
when
i
spoke
to
her
although
she
had
not
heard
me
approach
what
do
the
people
here
think
of
me
she
asked
abruptly
what
do
they
say
they
have
yet
to
discover
your
faults
i
answered
she
compressed
her
lips
and
looked
down
the
line
again
that
is
my
train
i
think
she
said
presently
when
i
had
put
her
into
a
carriage
she
shook
hands
with
me
thanking
me
gravely
then
threw
herself
back
in
her
seat
and
was
borne
away
that
was
literally
all
that
passed
between
us
yet
she
left
me
standing
there
staring
after
her
stupidly
and
curiously
impressed
there
was
always
a
suggestion
of
something
unusual
about
her
which
piqued
my
interest
and
kept
it
alive
during
the
summer
and
autumn
i
met
her
at
various
places
and
saw
her
also
in
her
own
house
and
she
seemed
so
far
as
an
outsider
could
judge
as
happily
situated
as
most
women
of
her
station
and
not
at
all
likely
to
require
any
special
service
at
the
hands
of
a
friend
her
husband
was
a
good
deal
older
than
herself
but
the
disparity
made
no
apparent
difference
to
their
comfort
when
he
was
absent
she
never
talked
about
him
but
when
he
was
present
she
treated
him
with
unvarying
consideration
and
they
appeared
together
everywhere
mindful
of
my
promise
to
lady
adeline
i
showed
them
both
every
attention
in
my
power
i
called
regularly
and
colonel
colquhoun
as
regularly
returned
my
calls
sometimes
bringing
evadne
with
him
the
winter
that
year
came
upon
us
suddenly
and
sharply
and
until
it
set
in
i
had
only
seen
her
under
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
cold
weather
she
had
an
illness
which
was
the
means
of
my
learning
to
know
more
of
her
true
character
and
surroundings
in
a
few
days
than
i
should
probably
have
done
in
years
of
mere
social
intercourse
i
stopped
for
a
moment
one
morning
as
i
drove
past
to
leave
her
some
flowers
and
her
own
maid
who
opened
the
door
showed
me
upstairs
to
a
small
sitting
room
the
to
another
room
beyond
at
the
door
of
which
she
knocked
i
heard
no
answer
but
the
girl
entered
and
announced
me
i
followed
her
in
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
evadne
she
was
in
bed
the
maid
withdrew
closing
the
door
after
her
what
nonsense
is
this
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
doctor
evadne
exclaimed
feebly
that
stupid
girl
must
have
thought
that
you
were
coming
to
see
me
professionally
but
oh
let
me
look
at
the
flowers
and
she
stretched
out
her
left
hand
for
them
offering
me
her
right
at
the
same
time
to
shake
and
burying
her
face
and
her
embarrassment
together
her
hand
was
hot
and
dry
i
do
require
you
in
the
least
doctor
she
assured
me
looking
up
brightly
from
the
flowers
but
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
why
are
you
in
bed
i
asked
responding
cheerfully
to
this
cheerful
greeting
oh
i
have
a
little
cold
she
answered
i
drew
a
chair
to
the
bedside
laid
my
hand
on
her
wrist
and
watched
her
closely
as
i
questioned
her
cough
incessant
respiration
rapid
temperature
high
i
judged
pulse
how
long
have
you
had
this
cold
i
asked
about
a
week
she
said
it
makes
me
ache
all
over
you
know
and
that
is
why
i
am
in
bed
i
saw
at
once
that
she
was
seriously
ill
and
i
also
saw
that
she
was
bearing
up
bravely
and
making
as
little
of
it
as
possible
why
is
your
fire
lit
i
asked
oh
i
never
thought
of
having
one
she
answered
and
what
is
that
you
are
drinking
cold
water
well
you
must
drink
any
more
cold
water
or
anything
else
cold
until
i
give
you
leave
i
ordered
and
do
try
to
talk
i
will
come
and
see
you
again
by
and
by
i
went
downstairs
to
look
for
colonel
colquhoun
and
found
him
just
about
to
start
for
barracks
i
am
sorry
to
say
your
wife
is
very
ill
i
said
she
has
an
attack
of
acute
bronchitis
and
it
may
mean
pneumonia
as
well
i
have
not
examined
her
chest
she
must
have
fires
in
her
room
and
a
bronchitis
kettle
at
once
do
let
the
temperature
get
below
till
i
see
her
again
her
maid
can
manage
for
a
few
hours
i
suppose
but
you
had
better
telegraph
for
a
nurse
one
should
be
here
before
night
what
a
damned
nuisance
these
women
are
colquhoun
answered
cheerfully
there
always
something
the
matter
with
them
i
returned
between
five
and
six
in
the
evening
walked
in
and
not
seeing
anybody
about
went
up
to
evadne
sitting
room
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
was
open
and
i
entered
she
was
alone
and
had
propped
herself
up
in
bed
with
pillows
the
difficulty
of
breathing
had
become
greater
and
she
found
relief
in
that
attitude
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
unnaturally
large
and
solemn
as
i
entered
and
it
was
a
full
moment
before
she
recognised
me
the
fires
had
not
been
lighted
in
either
of
the
rooms
and
she
was
evidently
much
worse
why
have
these
fires
been
lighted
i
demanded
this
is
only
october
she
answered
jesting
and
we
do
begin
fires
till
november
i
rang
the
bell
emphatically
do
not
trouble
yourself
doctor
she
remonstrated
gently
what
does
it
matter
i
went
out
into
the
sitting
room
to
meet
the
maid
as
she
entered
why
have
these
fires
been
lighted
i
asked
again
i
do
know
sir
she
answered
i
received
no
orders
about
them
where
is
colonel
colquhoun
he
went
out
after
breakfast
sir
and
has
not
come
back
yet
has
the
nurse
arrived
no
sir
well
light
these
fires
at
once
i
do
light
fires
sir
she
said
drawing
herself
up
it
is
my
work
whose
work
is
it
i
demanded
either
of
the
housemaids
sir
but
they
both
out
she
answered
ogling
me
pertly
i
own
that
i
was
exasperated
and
i
showed
it
in
such
a
way
that
she
fled
precipitately
i
followed
her
downstairs
to
find
the
butler
i
happened
to
know
the
man
his
wife
had
been
in
my
service
and
i
had
attended
her
through
a
severe
illness
since
her
marriage
do
you
know
if
there
such
a
thing
as
a
sensible
woman
in
this
establishment
williamson
i
demanded
well
sir
the
cook
sensible
when
she
sober
he
answered
pinching
his
chin
dubiously
does
she
happen
to
be
sober
now
he
glanced
at
the
clock
i
just
see
sir
he
said
when
he
returned
he
announced
with
perfect
gravity
that
she
was
sober
but
busy
with
the
dinner
then
look
here
i
exclaimed
out
of
all
patience
we
must
do
it
ourselves
yes
sir
he
said
anything
i
do
when
i
explained
the
difficulty
he
suggested
sending
for
his
wife
who
could
manage
he
thought
until
the
trained
nurse
arrived
and
help
her
afterward
it
was
a
good
idea
and
my
man
was
despatched
to
bring
her
immediately
they
a
bad
lot
o
servants
the
women
in
this
at
present
williamson
informed
me
the
missus
did
choose
and
he
shook
his
head
significantly
but
she
knows
what
what
and
going
that
why
they
takin
advantage
i
returned
to
evadne
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
forehead
contracted
every
breath
of
cold
air
was
cutting
her
lungs
like
a
knife
but
she
looked
up
at
me
when
i
took
her
hand
and
smiled
i
never
knew
anybody
so
patient
and
uncomplaining
she
was
lying
on
a
little
iron
bedstead
hard
and
narrow
as
a
camp
bed
the
room
was
the
floor
being
polished
and
with
only
two
small
rugs
one
at
the
fireplace
and
one
beside
the
bed
upon
it
it
looked
like
a
nun
cell
and
there
was
a
certain
suggestion
of
purity
in
the
sweetness
and
order
of
it
quite
consistent
with
the
idea
but
it
was
a
north
room
and
very
cold
evadne
had
unconsciously
clasped
my
hand
and
dozed
off
for
a
few
minutes
holding
it
tight
but
the
cough
her
when
she
looked
at
me
again
her
mind
was
wandering
she
knew
me
but
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
i
am
so
thankful
she
exclaimed
the
peace
of
mind
the
peace
of
mind
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
relief
it
is
williamson
came
in
on
tiptoe
and
lit
the
fire
and
evadne
maid
followed
him
in
and
stood
looking
on
half
sheepishly
and
half
in
defiance
i
noticed
now
that
she
was
a
girl
not
at
all
the
sort
of
person
to
have
about
my
delicate
little
lady
and
when
williamson
arrived
i
ordered
her
out
of
the
room
and
never
allowed
her
to
enter
it
again
during
the
week
she
left
altogether
and
i
was
fortunately
able
to
procure
a
suitable
woman
to
wait
upon
colquhoun
she
has
been
with
her
ever
since
by
the
way
i
felt
pretty
sure
by
this
time
that
no
nurse
had
been
sent
for
and
i
therefore
despatched
one
of
colonel
colquhoun
men
in
a
dogcart
to
morningquest
to
telegraph
for
one
but
she
could
not
arrive
before
daylight
even
by
special
train
and
it
had
now
become
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
as
williamson
had
no
knowledge
of
nursing
to
help
her
good
will
i
determined
to
spend
the
night
beside
my
patient
when
colonel
colquhoun
came
in
and
found
me
making
myself
at
home
in
his
house
he
expressed
himself
greatly
pleased
when
i
returned
this
afternoon
to
see
how
colquhoun
was
progressing
i
found
that
none
of
my
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
now
she
is
dangerously
ill
i
said
severely
faith
he
replied
changing
countenance
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
and
i
afraid
i
to
blame
for
i
was
in
the
deuce
of
a
hurry
when
i
saw
you
this
morning
and
never
thought
of
a
word
you
said
from
that
moment
to
this
now
i
genuinely
sorry
he
repeated
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
orton
beg
she
gone
abroad
for
the
winter
ah
to
be
sure
and
everybody
else
is
away
who
would
be
of
any
use
i
added
and
i
therefore
propose
if
you
have
no
objection
to
stay
here
myself
you
oblige
me
greatly
by
doing
so
he
answered
earnestly
i
know
what
there
is
for
dinner
but
i
shall
enjoy
it
all
the
more
myself
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
he
made
no
special
inquiries
about
his
wife
condition
and
never
went
near
her
but
as
he
was
in
a
tolerably
advanced
state
of
intoxication
before
he
retired
for
the
night
it
was
quite
as
well
perhaps
williamson
had
probably
done
her
day
work
before
i
sent
for
her
and
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
to
wake
and
watch
she
fell
fast
asleep
before
midnight
and
i
let
her
sleep
there
were
only
the
fires
to
be
attended
to
at
least
that
was
all
that
i
could
have
trusted
her
to
do
watching
the
case
generally
and
seizing
opportune
moments
to
administer
remedies
would
not
have
been
in
her
line
at
all
evadne
knew
me
always
but
she
lost
all
count
of
time
you
seem
to
come
every
day
now
doctor
she
said
once
during
the
night
and
i
glad
to
see
you
for
two
hours
toward
dawn
when
the
temperature
is
sensibly
lower
i
gave
my
little
lady
up
but
she
was
better
by
the
time
the
trained
nurse
arrived
and
eventually
she
pulled
through
greatly
owing
i
am
sure
to
her
own
perfect
patience
she
was
always
the
same
all
through
her
illness
gentle
uncomplaining
grateful
for
every
trifle
that
was
done
for
her
and
tranquillity
herself
my
impression
was
that
she
enjoyed
being
ill
i
never
saw
a
symptom
of
depression
the
whole
time
but
when
she
had
quite
recovered
and
although
as
often
happens
after
a
severe
illness
when
trifles
are
discovered
and
checked
which
would
otherwise
have
been
allowed
to
run
on
until
they
grew
serious
although
for
this
reason
she
was
certainly
stronger
than
she
had
ever
been
since
i
became
acquainted
with
her
no
sooner
did
she
resume
her
accustomed
habits
than
that
old
unsatisfactory
something
in
her
which
it
was
so
easy
to
perceive
but
so
difficult
to
define
returned
in
full
force
i
had
ceased
to
be
critical
however
colonel
colquhoun
careless
neglect
of
her
had
continued
throughout
her
illness
and
i
thought
i
understood
chapter
vi
i
had
necessarily
seen
much
of
evadne
during
her
illness
and
the
intimacy
never
again
lapsed
jealousy
was
not
one
of
colonel
colquhoun
vices
he
always
encouraged
any
man
to
come
to
the
house
for
whom
she
showed
the
slightest
preference
and
i
have
heard
him
complain
of
her
indifference
to
admiration
she
dress
herself
up
carefully
in
the
evening
to
sit
at
home
alone
with
me
and
go
out
to
a
big
dinner
party
in
the
dowdiest
gown
she
got
he
told
me
once
she
does
care
a
hang
whether
she
admired
or
not
rather
objects
if
anything
perhaps
colonel
colquhoun
rubbed
his
hands
here
with
a
certain
enjoyment
of
such
perversity
but
i
could
see
that
evadne
did
not
relish
the
subject
it
was
one
afternoon
at
i
was
tired
after
a
long
day
and
had
dropped
in
to
ask
for
some
tea
colonel
colquhoun
came
up
to
entertain
me
and
evadne
went
on
with
her
work
while
we
chatted
familiarly
you
were
never
so
civil
to
any
of
your
admirers
evadne
as
you
were
to
that
great
boy
in
the
regiment
colonel
colquhoun
continued
quite
blind
to
her
obvious
and
natural
though
silent
objection
to
being
made
the
subject
of
conversation
a
young
subaltern
of
ours
he
explained
to
me
a
big
lad
six
feet
high
who
just
worshipped
evadne
poor
boy
said
evadne
sighing
he
was
cruelly
butchered
in
a
horribly
fruitless
skirmish
with
his
fellow
creatures
during
that
last
small
war
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
be
kind
to
him
he
was
always
very
nice
to
me
well
there
a
reason
for
everything
colonel
colquhoun
observed
gallantly
do
you
like
boys
evadne
asked
looking
up
at
me
the
ones
we
have
here
at
the
depôt
when
they
first
come
fresh
from
the
public
schools
are
delightful
with
their
high
spirits
and
their
love
affairs
their
pranks
and
the
something
beyond
which
will
make
men
of
them
eventually
i
can
never
see
enough
of
boys
but
colonel
colquhoun
very
kindly
lets
me
have
as
many
of
them
here
as
i
like
faith
i
ca
keep
them
out
for
they
all
in
love
with
you
said
colonel
colquhoun
and
i
am
in
love
with
them
all
she
answered
brightly
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
holding
up
her
work
to
look
at
it
as
she
did
so
the
lower
half
of
her
face
was
concealed
from
me
and
her
eyes
were
cast
down
i
only
glanced
at
her
but
in
the
act
of
doing
so
i
suddenly
became
aware
by
one
of
those
curious
flashes
of
imperfect
recollection
which
come
to
us
all
at
times
to
torment
us
that
i
had
seen
her
somewhere
before
i
knew
who
she
was
in
that
attitude
exactly
but
where
or
under
what
circumstance
i
failed
to
recollect
the
impression
however
was
indelible
and
haunted
me
ever
afterward
now
there
diavolo
colonel
colquhoun
continued
the
exchange
i
had
suggested
had
been
effected
by
this
time
and
diavolo
was
quartered
at
the
depôt
not
exactly
to
colonel
colquhoun
delight
perhaps
but
he
was
very
good
about
it
now
there
diavolo
he
tells
me
to
my
face
that
he
was
the
first
to
propose
to
colquhoun
and
always
meant
to
marry
her
and
means
it
still
he
said
to
me
coaxingly
only
last
friday
when
i
was
coming
out
of
barracks
me
home
with
you
sir
and
i
answered
pretending
to
be
severe
but
pulling
his
sleeve
you
know
i
wo
you
be
making
love
to
mrs
colquhoun
and
he
got
very
red
and
said
quite
huffily
i
think
you
might
let
a
fellow
look
at
her
and
of
course
i
had
to
bring
him
back
with
me
and
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
there
and
got
on
with
the
most
ridiculous
nonsense
you
could
help
laughing
should
like
to
kill
you
and
carry
her
off
he
said
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
meant
it
and
no
more
harm
in
the
boy
either
than
there
is
in
evadne
herself
colonel
colquhoun
added
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
man
at
his
best
latterly
i
had
seldom
seen
him
in
such
a
genial
mood
at
home
abroad
he
brightened
up
but
in
his
own
house
for
a
process
of
deterioration
had
been
going
on
ever
since
his
arrival
in
morningquest
his
mind
was
apt
to
resemble
a
dark
cave
which
is
transformed
diurnally
by
a
single
shaft
of
sunshine
which
streams
in
for
a
brief
space
at
a
certain
hour
the
happy
moment
with
him
occurred
about
the
time
of
the
tenth
as
nearly
as
i
could
calculate
and
it
lasted
till
the
eleventh
when
he
usually
relapsed
into
gloom
again
and
became
overcast
until
the
next
recurrence
of
the
phenomena
but
whatever
his
mood
was
evadne
humoured
it
she
responded
always
or
tried
to
when
he
was
genial
and
when
he
was
morose
she
was
dumb
i
thought
her
a
model
wife
chapter
vii
after
her
illness
evadne
spent
much
of
her
time
in
the
west
window
of
the
drawing
room
at
with
her
little
beside
her
embroidering
i
never
saw
her
reading
and
there
were
no
books
about
the
room
but
the
work
she
did
was
beautiful
she
used
to
have
a
stand
before
her
with
flowers
arranged
upon
it
and
copy
them
on
to
some
material
in
coloured
silks
direct
from
nature
she
could
not
draw
either
with
pen
or
pencil
or
paint
with
a
brush
but
she
could
copy
with
her
needle
quite
accurately
and
would
do
a
spray
of
lilies
to
the
life
or
in
the
most
approved
conventional
manner
if
it
pleased
her
her
not
being
able
to
draw
struck
me
as
a
curious
limitation
and
i
asked
her
once
if
she
could
account
for
it
in
any
way
i
believe
i
am
an
example
of
how
much
we
owe
to
early
influences
she
answered
laughing
and
probably
i
have
the
talent
both
for
drawing
and
painting
in
me
but
it
remains
latent
for
want
of
cultivation
my
mother
drew
and
painted
beautifully
as
a
girl
but
she
had
given
both
up
before
i
was
old
enough
to
imitate
her
and
only
copied
flowers
as
i
do
with
her
needle
and
i
used
to
watch
her
at
her
work
until
i
felt
impelled
to
do
the
same
if
she
had
gone
on
with
her
drawing
i
am
sure
i
should
have
drawn
too
but
as
it
was
i
never
thought
of
trying
moral
for
mothers
i
observed
keep
up
your
own
accomplishments
if
you
would
have
your
daughters
shine
evadne
was
not
enough
in
the
fresh
air
at
this
time
and
she
was
too
much
alone
i
ventured
once
in
my
professional
capacity
to
say
that
she
should
have
friends
to
stay
with
her
occasionally
but
she
passed
the
suggestion
off
without
either
accepting
or
declining
it
and
then
i
spoke
to
colonel
colquhoun
he
however
the
idea
altogether
she
all
right
he
said
you
do
know
her
she
always
lives
like
that
it
her
way
i
also
counselled
regular
exercise
and
to
that
she
replied
i
go
out
why
you
passed
me
yourself
on
the
road
only
the
other
day
i
certainly
had
seen
her
more
than
once
alone
miles
away
from
home
walking
at
the
top
of
her
speed
as
if
impelled
by
some
strong
emotion
or
inexorable
necessity
and
i
did
not
like
the
sign
one
or
two
hours
walk
regularly
every
day
is
what
you
should
take
i
told
her
the
virtue
of
it
is
in
the
regularity
if
you
make
a
habit
of
taking
a
short
walk
daily
you
will
have
got
more
sunshine
and
fresh
air
which
is
what
you
specially
require
in
one
year
than
you
will
in
two
if
you
continue
to
go
out
in
a
jerky
irregular
way
and
you
must
give
up
covering
impossible
distances
in
feverish
haste
as
you
do
now
walk
gently
and
make
yourself
feel
that
you
have
full
leisure
to
walk
as
long
as
you
like
you
will
find
the
effect
tranquillizing
it
is
a
common
mistake
to
make
a
business
of
taking
exercise
i
am
constantly
lecturing
my
patients
about
it
if
you
want
exercise
to
raise
your
spirits
brace
your
nerves
and
do
you
good
generally
it
must
be
all
pure
pleasure
without
conscious
exertion
pleasurable
moments
prolong
life
thank
you
evadne
answered
gently
i
know
of
course
that
you
are
right
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
profit
by
your
advice
if
it
be
only
to
show
you
how
much
i
appreciate
your
kindness
but
i
must
have
a
scamper
occasionally
a
regular
you
know
please
do
stop
that
the
indulgence
when
i
am
in
the
mood
is
my
pet
vice
at
present
the
great
drawing
room
at
which
i
had
mentioned
in
my
letter
to
lady
adeline
as
containing
the
one
bright
spot
in
that
gloomy
abode
was
an
addition
tacked
on
to
the
end
of
the
house
and
evidently
an
afterthought
it
was
entered
by
a
flight
of
shallow
steps
from
the
hall
and
was
above
the
level
of
the
public
road
which
ran
close
past
that
end
of
the
house
the
grounds
and
approach
being
on
the
other
side
it
was
lighted
by
three
high
narrow
windows
looking
toward
the
north
and
three
more
close
together
looking
west
and
forming
a
bay
so
deep
as
to
be
quite
a
small
room
in
itself
it
almost
overhung
the
only
a
tall
being
between
them
but
so
near
that
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
holly
grew
up
to
the
it
was
a
quiet
road
however
too
far
from
the
town
for
much
traffic
and
evadne
could
sit
there
with
the
windows
open
undisturbed
and
enjoy
the
long
level
prospect
of
fertile
land
field
and
fallow
wood
and
water
that
lay
before
her
she
sat
in
the
centre
window
and
i
think
it
was
from
thence
that
she
learnt
to
appreciate
the
charms
of
a
level
landscape
as
you
look
down
upon
it
about
which
i
heard
her
discourse
so
eloquently
in
after
days
it
was
her
chosen
corner
and
there
she
sat
silent
many
and
many
an
hour
with
busy
fingers
and
thoughts
we
could
not
follow
communing
at
times
with
nature
i
doubt
not
or
with
her
own
heart
and
thankful
to
be
still
the
road
beneath
her
was
one
i
had
to
traverse
regularly
and
it
became
a
habit
to
look
up
as
i
drove
past
if
she
were
in
her
accustomed
seat
she
usually
raised
her
eyes
from
her
work
for
a
moment
to
smile
me
a
greeting
once
she
was
standing
up
leaning
languidly
against
the
window
frame
twirling
a
rose
in
her
fingers
but
she
straightened
herself
into
momentary
energy
when
she
recognized
me
and
threw
the
rose
at
me
with
accurate
aim
it
was
the
youngest
and
most
familiar
thing
i
had
known
her
do
an
impulse
of
pure
mischief
i
thought
for
the
rose
was
and
the
sentiment
as
i
translated
it
was
you
will
value
it
more
than
i
do
for
she
hated
the
french
there
often
occurs
and
recurs
to
the
mind
incessantly
a
verse
or
an
apt
quotation
in
connection
with
some
act
or
event
a
haunting
definition
of
the
impression
it
makes
upon
us
and
evadne
in
the
wide
west
window
bending
busily
over
her
work
set
my
mind
on
one
occasion
to
a
borrowed
measure
of
words
which
never
failed
me
from
that
time
forward
when
i
saw
her
so
engaged
there
she
weaves
by
night
and
day
a
magic
web
of
colour
gay
she
has
heard
a
whisper
say
a
curse
is
on
her
if
she
stay
to
look
down
to
camelot
she
knows
not
what
the
curse
may
be
and
so
she
weaveth
steadily
and
little
other
care
hath
she
the
lady
of
shalott
but
where
was
camelot
fountain
towers
just
appearing
above
the
to
the
north
was
the
only
human
habitation
in
sight
i
had
a
powerful
telescope
on
the
highest
tower
and
one
day
in
an
idle
mood
i
happened
to
be
looking
through
it
with
no
definite
purpose
just
sweeping
it
slowly
from
point
to
point
of
the
landscape
when
all
at
once
evadne
came
into
the
field
of
vision
with
such
startling
distinctness
that
i
stepped
back
from
the
glass
she
was
sitting
in
her
accustomed
place
with
her
work
on
her
lap
her
hands
clasped
before
her
leaning
forward
looking
up
in
my
direction
with
an
expression
in
her
whole
attitude
that
appealed
to
me
like
a
cry
for
help
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
i
ordered
my
dogcart
out
and
drove
over
to
at
once
but
i
found
her
perfectly
tranquil
when
i
arrived
with
no
trace
of
recent
emotion
either
in
her
manner
or
appearance
when
i
went
home
i
had
the
telescope
removed
i
had
forgotten
that
we
overlooked
that
corner
of
chapter
viii
the
idea
that
evadne
was
naturally
unsociable
was
pretty
general
and
colonel
colquhoun
believed
it
as
much
as
anybody
i
remember
being
at
one
afternoon
when
he
rallied
her
on
the
subject
he
had
stopped
me
as
i
was
driving
past
to
ask
me
to
look
at
a
horse
he
was
thinking
of
buying
the
animal
was
being
trotted
up
and
down
the
approach
by
a
groom
for
our
inspection
when
evadne
returned
from
somewhere
driving
herself
she
pulled
up
beside
us
and
got
out
i
never
see
you
driving
any
of
your
friends
about
colonel
colquhoun
remarked
you
very
unsociable
evadne
oh
well
you
see
she
answered
slowly
i
like
to
be
alone
and
think
when
i
am
driving
it
worries
me
to
have
to
talk
to
people
as
a
rule
well
he
said
glancing
at
the
reeking
pony
if
your
thoughts
went
as
fast
as
blue
mick
seems
to
have
done
you
must
have
got
through
a
good
deal
of
thinking
in
the
time
evadne
looked
at
the
pony
take
him
round
she
said
to
the
groom
and
then
she
remarked
that
it
must
be
and
asked
us
both
to
go
in
and
have
some
the
air
had
brought
a
delicate
tinge
of
colour
to
her
usually
pale
cheeks
and
she
looked
bright
and
bonny
as
she
sat
beside
the
taking
off
her
gloves
and
chatting
with
her
hat
pushed
slightly
up
from
her
forehead
it
was
an
expansive
moment
with
her
one
of
the
rare
ones
when
she
unconsciously
revealed
something
of
herself
in
her
conversation
there
were
some
flowers
on
the
which
i
admired
ah
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
in
their
beauty
i
derive
all
my
pleasure
in
life
from
things
inanimate
an
arrangement
of
marigolds
with
brown
centres
in
a
glass
like
these
all
aglow
beneath
the
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
at
this
moment
not
more
pleasure
than
your
friends
do
i
ventured
i
do
know
she
replied
in
the
matter
of
love
amari
friends
disappoint
us
but
in
the
contemplation
of
flowers
all
our
finer
feelings
are
stimulated
and
blended
and
yet
there
is
no
excess
of
feeling
to
end
in
regrets
or
a
painful
reaction
when
the
flowers
fade
we
cheerfully
gather
fresh
ones
but
i
hope
i
do
not
undervalue
my
friends
she
broke
off
i
only
mean
to
say
when
you
think
of
all
the
uncertainties
of
life
of
sickness
and
death
and
other
things
more
dreadful
which
overtake
our
dearest
do
what
we
will
to
protect
them
and
then
that
worst
thing
whether
it
be
in
ourselves
or
others
i
mean
change
when
you
think
of
it
all
surely
it
is
well
to
turn
to
some
delicate
source
of
delight
like
this
for
relief
and
to
forget
and
she
curved
her
slender
hand
round
the
flowers
caressingly
looking
up
at
me
at
the
same
time
as
if
she
were
pleading
to
be
allowed
to
have
her
own
way
i
did
not
remonstrate
with
her
i
hardly
knew
the
danger
then
myself
of
refusing
to
suffer
it
was
some
weeks
before
i
saw
her
again
after
that
i
had
been
busy
but
one
day
as
i
was
driving
into
morningquest
i
overtook
her
on
the
road
walking
in
the
same
direction
i
was
in
a
close
carriage
but
i
pulled
the
checkstring
as
soon
as
i
recognized
her
and
got
out
she
turned
when
she
heard
the
carriage
stop
and
seeing
me
alight
came
forward
and
shook
hands
she
looked
wan
and
weary
those
are
fine
horses
of
yours
was
her
smileless
greeting
how
are
you
have
you
been
having
a
i
said
she
was
quite
five
miles
from
home
she
looked
up
and
down
the
road
for
answer
and
affected
to
laugh
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
not
at
all
in
a
laughing
mood
and
also
that
she
was
already
i
thought
of
begging
to
be
allowed
to
drive
her
back
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
even
if
she
consented
which
was
not
likely
as
she
had
a
perfect
horror
of
giving
trouble
and
would
never
have
been
persuaded
that
i
was
not
going
out
of
my
way
at
the
greatest
personal
inconvenience
merely
to
pay
her
a
polite
attention
but
even
if
she
had
consented
she
would
probably
have
had
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
alone
in
that
great
west
window
with
nothing
to
take
her
out
of
herself
and
nothing
more
enlivening
to
look
at
than
dreary
winter
fields
under
a
sombre
sky
and
that
would
not
do
at
all
a
better
idea
however
occurred
to
me
i
am
going
to
see
orton
beg
i
said
she
is
not
very
well
evadne
had
been
staring
blandly
at
the
level
landscape
but
she
turned
to
me
when
i
spoke
and
some
interest
came
into
her
eyes
have
you
seen
her
lately
i
continued
she
answered
as
if
she
were
considering
not
for
some
time
come
now
i
boldly
suggested
it
will
do
her
good
i
wo
talk
if
you
want
to
think
i
added
her
face
melted
into
a
smile
at
this
and
on
seeing
her
stiffness
relax
i
wasted
no
more
time
in
persuasion
but
returned
to
the
carriage
and
held
the
door
open
for
her
she
followed
me
slowly
although
she
looked
as
if
she
had
not
quite
made
up
her
mind
and
got
in
but
still
as
if
she
were
hesitating
once
she
was
seated
however
i
could
see
that
she
was
not
sorry
she
had
yielded
and
presently
she
acknowledged
as
much
herself
i
believe
i
was
tired
she
said
rest
now
then
i
answered
taking
a
paper
out
of
my
pocket
she
settled
herself
more
luxuriously
in
her
corner
put
her
arm
in
the
strap
and
looked
out
through
the
open
window
the
day
was
mild
though
murky
the
sky
was
leaden
gray
we
rolled
through
the
wintry
landscape
rapidly
brown
hedgerows
leafless
trees
ploughed
fields
a
crow
two
crows
a
whole
flock
from
their
feeding
ground
scattered
cottages
a
woman
at
a
door
looking
out
with
a
child
in
her
arms
three
boys
swinging
on
a
gate
a
man
trudging
along
with
a
bundle
a
labourer
trimming
a
bank
mist
rising
in
the
meadows
grazing
cattle
nibbling
sheep
but
she
did
not
see
these
things
at
first
any
of
them
she
was
thinking
then
she
began
to
see
and
forgot
to
think
then
her
fatigue
wore
off
and
a
sense
of
relief
of
ease
and
of
generally
took
gradual
possession
of
her
i
could
see
the
change
come
into
her
countenance
and
before
we
had
arrived
in
morningquest
she
had
begun
to
talk
to
me
cheerfully
of
her
own
accord
we
had
to
skirt
the
old
gray
walls
which
surrounded
the
palace
gardens
and
as
we
did
so
she
looked
up
at
them
indifferently
at
first
but
immediately
afterward
with
a
sudden
flash
of
recognition
she
said
nothing
but
i
could
see
she
drew
herself
together
as
if
she
had
been
hurt
do
you
go
there
often
i
asked
her
no
edith
died
there
and
then
that
child
she
answered
looking
at
me
as
if
she
were
surprised
that
i
should
have
thought
it
likely
she
shrinks
from
sorrowful
associations
and
painful
sights
i
thought
but
i
did
not
know
when
i
asked
the
question
that
our
poor
edith
had
been
a
particular
friend
of
hers
we
stopped
the
next
moment
at
orton
beg
and
she
leant
forward
to
look
at
the
windows
smiling
and
brightening
again
i
helped
her
out
and
followed
her
to
the
door
which
she
opened
as
if
she
were
at
home
there
she
waited
for
me
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
till
i
put
my
hat
down
and
then
we
went
to
the
drawing
room
together
and
walked
in
in
the
same
familiar
way
orton
beg
was
there
with
another
lady
a
stout
but
very
comely
person
handsomely
dressed
who
seemed
to
have
just
risen
to
take
her
leave
the
moment
evadne
saw
this
lady
she
sprang
forward
mother
she
cried
throwing
her
arms
round
her
neck
evadne
my
dear
dear
child
the
lady
exclaimed
clasping
her
close
and
kissing
her
and
then
holding
her
off
to
look
at
her
why
my
child
how
thin
you
are
and
pale
and
weak
oh
mother
i
so
glad
i
so
glad
evadne
cried
again
nestling
close
up
to
her
and
kissing
her
neck
and
then
she
laid
her
head
on
her
bosom
and
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
i
instantly
left
the
room
and
orton
beg
followed
me
they
have
not
met
since
just
after
evadne
marriage
she
explained
to
me
evadne
offended
her
father
and
there
still
seems
to
be
no
hope
of
a
reconciliation
but
surely
it
is
cruel
to
separate
mother
and
child
i
exclaimed
indignantly
he
has
no
right
to
do
that
no
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
it
with
one
of
us
she
answered
bitterly
but
my
sister
is
of
a
yielding
disposition
she
is
like
beale
one
of
the
women
who
thought
it
their
duty
to
submit
to
everything
and
make
the
best
of
everything
including
injustice
and
any
other
vice
it
pleased
their
lords
to
practise
but
for
this
weakness
of
good
women
the
world
would
be
a
brighter
and
better
place
by
this
time
we
see
the
disastrous
folly
of
submitting
our
reason
to
the
rule
of
and
now
however
and
please
god
we
shall
change
all
that
before
i
die
he
will
be
a
bold
man
soon
who
will
dare
to
have
the
impertinence
to
dictate
to
us
as
to
what
we
should
or
should
not
do
or
think
or
say
no
one
can
pretend
that
the
old
system
of
husband
and
master
has
answered
well
and
it
has
had
a
fair
trial
let
us
hope
that
the
new
method
of
partnership
will
be
more
successful
yes
indeed
i
answered
earnestly
orton
beg
looked
up
in
my
face
and
her
own
countenance
cleared
you
and
evadne
seem
to
be
very
good
friends
she
said
i
am
so
glad
then
she
looked
up
at
me
again
with
a
curious
little
smile
which
i
could
not
interpret
does
she
remind
you
of
anybody
of
anything
ever
she
asked
why
surely
she
is
like
you
i
said
seeing
a
likeness
for
the
first
time
yes
she
answered
in
a
more
indifferent
tone
there
is
a
likeness
i
am
told
i
tried
afterward
to
think
that
this
explained
the
haunting
half
recollection
i
seemed
to
have
of
something
about
evadne
but
it
did
not
on
the
contrary
it
and
confirmed
the
feeling
that
i
had
seen
evadne
before
i
knew
who
she
was
under
circumstances
which
i
now
failed
to
recall
thinking
she
would
like
to
be
alone
after
that
interview
with
her
mother
i
left
the
carriage
for
her
and
walked
back
to
fountain
towers
and
the
state
i
was
in
after
doing
the
ten
miles
warned
me
that
i
had
been
luxuriating
too
much
in
carriages
lately
and
must
begin
to
practise
what
i
preached
again
in
the
way
of
exercise
if
i
did
not
wish
to
lay
up
a
fat
and
flabby
old
age
for
myself
i
made
a
point
of
not
seeing
evadne
for
some
little
time
after
that
event
so
that
she
might
not
feel
bound
to
refer
to
it
in
case
she
should
shrink
from
doing
so
but
the
next
time
we
met
as
it
happened
i
had
another
glimpse
of
her
feeling
for
her
friends
which
showed
me
how
very
much
mistaken
i
had
been
in
my
estimate
of
the
depth
of
her
affections
it
was
at
i
had
walked
over
from
fountain
towers
and
dropped
in
casually
to
ask
for
some
tea
and
colonel
colquhoun
arriving
at
the
same
moment
from
barracks
we
went
up
to
the
drawing
room
together
and
found
evadne
in
her
accustomed
place
busy
with
her
embroidery
as
usual
she
shook
hands
but
said
nothing
to
show
that
she
was
aware
of
the
interval
there
had
been
since
she
saw
me
last
when
she
sat
down
again
however
she
went
on
with
her
work
and
there
was
a
certain
satisfied
look
in
her
face
as
if
some
little
wish
had
been
gratified
and
she
was
content
i
knew
when
she
took
up
her
work
that
she
liked
me
to
be
there
and
wanted
me
to
stay
for
she
always
put
it
down
when
visitors
she
did
not
care
for
called
and
made
a
business
of
entertaining
them
but
we
had
scarcely
settled
ourselves
to
talk
when
the
butler
opened
the
door
and
announced
bertram
frayling
and
a
tall
slender
remarkably
handsome
young
fellow
with
a
strong
family
likeness
to
evadne
herself
entered
with
boyish
diffidence
smiling
nervously
but
looking
important
too
evadne
jumped
up
impetuously
she
exclaimed
holding
out
her
arms
to
him
why
what
a
big
fellow
you
have
grown
she
cried
finding
she
could
hardly
reach
to
his
neck
to
hug
him
and
how
handsome
you
are
they
say
i
am
just
like
you
he
answered
looking
down
at
her
lovingly
with
his
arm
around
her
waist
neither
of
them
took
any
notice
of
us
this
is
your
birthday
dear
evadne
said
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
the
whole
day
long
i
always
keep
all
the
birthdays
did
you
remember
mine
i
do
think
i
did
he
answered
honestly
but
this
is
my
birthday
evadne
and
that
how
it
is
i
am
here
i
am
my
own
master
from
and
the
first
thing
you
do
with
your
liberty
is
to
come
and
see
your
sister
said
colonel
colquhoun
you
made
of
the
right
stuff
my
boy
and
he
shook
hands
with
him
heartily
evadne
clung
with
one
hand
to
his
shoulder
and
pressed
her
handkerchief
first
to
this
eye
and
then
to
that
alternately
with
the
other
looking
so
glad
however
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
she
was
going
to
laugh
or
cry
for
joy
but
are
there
rejoicings
she
asked
oh
yes
he
answered
but
i
told
my
father
if
you
were
not
asked
i
should
not
stay
for
them
i
was
determined
to
see
you
he
flushed
boyishly
as
he
spoke
and
smiled
round
upon
us
all
again
but
was
he
very
angry
evadne
said
yes
her
brother
answered
twinkling
the
girls
got
round
him
and
tried
to
persuade
him
but
they
only
made
him
worse
especially
when
they
all
declared
that
when
they
came
of
age
they
meant
to
do
too
he
said
that
he
was
afflicted
with
the
most
obstinate
family
in
the
county
and
began
to
row
mother
as
if
it
were
her
fault
but
i
would
stand
that
you
were
right
bertram
evadne
exclaimed
clenching
her
hands
now
that
you
are
a
man
never
let
mother
be
made
miserable
did
she
know
you
were
coming
yes
and
was
very
glad
he
answered
and
sent
you
messages
but
here
colonel
colquhoun
and
i
managed
to
slip
from
the
room
evadne
sent
her
brother
back
that
day
to
grace
the
close
of
the
festivities
in
his
honour
but
he
returned
the
following
week
and
stayed
at
and
also
with
me
when
he
confirmed
my
first
exceedingly
good
impression
of
him
evadne
quite
wakened
up
under
his
influence
but
unfortunately
for
her
he
went
abroad
in
a
few
weeks
for
a
two
years
trip
round
the
world
and
i
think
losing
him
again
so
soon
made
it
almost
worse
for
her
than
if
they
had
never
been
reunited
especially
as
another
and
irreparable
loss
came
upon
her
immediately
after
his
departure
this
was
the
sudden
death
of
her
mother
the
news
of
which
arrived
one
day
in
a
curt
note
written
by
her
father
to
colonel
colquhoun
no
previous
intimation
of
illness
having
been
sent
to
break
the
shock
of
the
announcement
i
can
never
be
thankful
enough
for
the
happy
chance
which
brought
about
that
last
accidental
meeting
of
evadne
with
her
mother
but
for
that
they
would
not
have
seen
each
other
again
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
learning
eventually
that
the
perfect
understanding
which
they
arrived
at
during
the
few
hours
they
spent
together
on
that
occasion
afterward
became
one
of
the
most
comforting
recollections
of
life
a
hallowed
memory
as
she
herself
expressed
it
such
as
it
is
very
good
for
us
to
cherish
thank
heaven
for
the
opportunity
which
renewed
and
intensified
my
appreciation
of
my
mother
love
and
goodness
so
as
to
make
my
last
impression
of
her
one
which
must
stand
out
distinctly
forever
from
the
rest
and
be
always
a
joyful
sorrow
to
recall
do
you
know
what
a
sorrow
is
ah
something
that
makes
one
feel
warm
and
forgiving
in
the
midst
of
one
regrets
a
delicious
feeling
when
it
takes
possession
of
you
you
cease
to
be
hard
and
cold
and
fierce
and
want
to
do
good
frayling
died
of
a
disease
for
which
we
have
a
remedy
nowadays
or
to
speak
plainly
she
died
for
want
of
proper
treatment
her
husband
gloried
in
what
he
called
a
rooted
objection
to
notions
and
would
not
send
for
a
modern
practitioner
even
when
the
case
became
serious
preferring
to
confide
it
entirely
to
a
very
worthy
old
gentleman
of
his
own
way
of
thinking
with
one
qualification
who
had
attended
his
household
successfully
for
years
during
which
time
only
one
other
member
of
his
family
had
ever
been
seriously
ill
and
he
also
had
died
but
i
hope
and
believe
that
my
poor
little
lady
never
knew
the
truth
about
her
mother
last
illness
she
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
as
it
was
and
it
cut
one
to
the
quick
to
see
her
day
after
day
in
her
black
dress
sitting
alone
pale
and
still
and
uncomplaining
her
invariable
attitude
when
she
was
deeply
distressed
and
not
to
be
able
to
say
a
word
or
do
a
thing
to
relieve
her
as
usual
at
that
time
of
the
year
everybody
whom
she
cared
to
see
at
all
was
away
except
myself
so
that
during
the
dreariest
of
the
winter
months
she
was
shut
up
with
her
grief
in
the
most
unwholesome
isolation
as
the
spring
returned
however
she
began
to
revive
and
then
suddenly
it
appeared
to
me
that
she
entered
upon
a
new
phase
altogether
chapter
ix
during
the
first
days
of
our
acquaintance
evadne
attitude
whatever
happened
surprised
me
i
could
anticipate
her
action
up
to
a
certain
point
but
just
the
precise
thing
she
would
do
was
the
last
thing
i
had
expected
i
knew
her
feeling
in
fact
but
i
was
ignorant
of
the
material
it
had
to
work
upon
and
by
means
of
which
it
found
expression
i
had
begun
by
believing
her
to
be
cold
and
but
even
before
her
illness
i
had
perceived
in
her
a
strange
desire
for
sympathy
and
foreseen
that
on
occasion
she
would
exact
it
in
large
measure
from
anyone
she
cared
about
it
was
making
much
of
a
cut
finger
one
day
that
she
had
led
me
to
expect
she
would
be
exacting
in
illness
languishing
as
ladies
do
to
excite
sympathy
and
when
the
illness
came
i
found
i
had
been
right
in
so
far
as
i
had
believed
that
she
would
appreciate
sympathy
but
entirely
wrong
about
the
means
she
would
employ
to
obtain
it
instead
of
languishing
when
she
found
herself
really
suffering
she
pulled
herself
together
and
bore
the
trial
with
heroic
calm
as
i
have
said
she
never
uttered
a
complaint
and
she
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
ignore
annoyances
which
few
people
in
perfect
health
could
have
borne
with
fortitude
certainly
her
attitude
then
had
excited
sympathy
and
respect
as
well
it
was
as
admirable
as
it
was
unexpected
i
had
also
perceived
that
she
could
not
bear
anything
disagreeable
she
seldom
showed
the
least
irritability
herself
nor
would
she
tolerate
it
for
a
moment
in
anyone
else
servants
who
were
not
always
cheerful
had
to
go
and
the
kind
of
people
who
snap
at
each
other
in
the
bosom
of
their
families
she
carefully
avoided
turning
from
them
instinctively
as
she
would
have
done
from
any
perception
revolting
to
the
physical
senses
and
that
she
would
fly
disgusted
from
sickening
sights
or
sounds
or
odours
i
never
doubted
but
here
again
i
was
wrong
or
rather
the
evidence
was
utterly
misleading
i
found
her
one
day
sitting
on
the
bridge
of
a
little
river
that
crossed
a
quiet
lane
near
their
house
and
got
down
from
my
horse
to
talk
to
her
and
as
we
stood
looking
over
the
parapet
looking
into
the
stream
the
bloated
carcase
of
a
dead
dog
came
floating
by
she
could
only
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
for
she
drew
back
instantly
but
she
looked
so
pale
and
nauseated
that
i
had
to
take
her
to
the
house
and
insist
upon
her
having
some
wine
and
i
once
took
her
at
her
own
earnest
request
to
visit
a
children
hospital
but
before
we
had
seen
a
dozen
of
the
little
patients
she
cried
so
piteously
i
was
obliged
to
take
her
away
and
she
could
never
bear
to
speak
of
the
place
afterward
and
lastly
i
had
seen
how
she
shrank
from
going
to
the
palace
because
of
the
association
with
edith
terrible
death
and
the
chance
of
seeing
her
poor
repulsive
looking
little
boy
there
yet
when
it
came
to
be
a
question
of
facing
absolute
horrors
in
the
interests
of
the
sufferers
she
was
the
first
to
volunteer
and
she
did
so
with
a
quiet
determination
there
was
no
resisting
and
every
trace
of
inward
emotion
so
carefully
obliterated
that
one
might
have
been
forgiven
for
supposing
her
to
be
altogether
callous
this
happened
after
her
mother
death
in
the
spring
when
she
had
already
begun
to
revive
and
was
the
first
startling
symptom
she
showed
of
the
new
phase
of
interest
and
energy
upon
which
i
suspected
she
was
entering
i
hoped
at
the
time
that
the
great
grief
had
carried
off
the
minor
ailments
of
the
mind
as
the
great
illness
did
of
the
body
and
that
the
change
would
prove
to
be
for
the
better
eventually
although
the
first
outcome
of
it
was
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
liked
at
all
for
her
i
had
not
seen
her
for
a
week
or
so
when
she
was
ushered
one
morning
into
my
consulting
room
she
had
not
asked
for
an
appointment
and
had
been
waiting
to
take
her
turn
with
the
other
patients
well
what
can
i
do
for
i
said
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
her
you
do
look
very
no
thank
goodness
she
answered
cheerfully
and
i
do
mean
to
be
ill
i
have
come
to
be
vaccinated
ah
that
is
wise
i
said
you
have
heard
i
suppose
that
has
broken
out
in
the
barracks
she
said
when
she
was
going
there
are
fifteen
cases
four
of
them
women
and
one
a
child
and
they
are
going
to
put
them
under
canvas
on
the
common
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
and
see
that
they
are
properly
nursed
that
is
why
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
military
nursing
is
of
the
most
primitive
kind
in
times
of
peace
our
doctor
is
all
that
he
should
be
but
what
can
he
do
but
prescribe
it
takes
all
his
time
just
to
go
round
and
get
through
his
ordinary
duties
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
look
after
the
patients
i
asked
politely
yes
she
answered
defiantly
i
am
going
to
be
isolated
with
them
out
on
the
common
my
tent
is
already
pitched
i
shall
not
take
i
assure
you
i
do
see
how
you
can
be
so
sure
i
said
she
gave
me
one
of
her
most
puzzling
answers
one
of
those
in
which
i
felt
there
was
an
indication
of
the
something
about
her
which
i
did
not
understand
oh
because
it
is
such
a
relief
she
said
how
a
relief
i
questioned
oh
i
shall
not
take
the
disease
she
repeated
and
i
shall
enjoy
the
occupation
but
this
i
knew
was
an
evasion
however
i
had
no
time
to
argue
the
point
with
her
just
then
so
i
waited
until
my
consultations
were
over
and
then
went
to
see
colonel
colquhoun
i
thought
if
he
would
not
forbid
he
might
at
all
events
persuade
her
to
abandon
her
rash
design
i
found
him
at
his
own
place
walking
about
the
garden
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
he
was
in
a
facetious
mood
the
one
of
his
i
most
disliked
now
you
look
quite
concerned
he
said
with
an
extra
affectation
of
brogue
when
i
had
told
him
my
errand
sure
she
humbugs
you
evadne
does
if
you
knew
her
as
well
as
i
do
you
not
be
troubling
yourself
about
her
so
much
i
tell
you
she
come
to
no
harm
in
the
world
now
what
do
you
think
were
her
reasons
for
going
to
live
in
the
camp
then
she
gone
i
exclaimed
oh
yes
she
gone
he
answered
the
grass
never
has
time
to
grow
under
that
young
woman
feet
if
she
an
idea
to
carry
out
i
will
say
that
for
her
but
what
do
you
think
she
said
when
i
asked
her
why
she
be
going
among
the
patients
she
said
want
to
see
what
they
look
like
and
she
another
reason
too
she
make
herself
look
like
an
interesting
nurse
you
know
and
quite
enjoy
dressing
up
for
the
part
i
felt
sure
that
all
this
was
a
horrid
perversion
of
the
truth
but
i
let
it
pass
you
not
interfere
then
i
persisted
not
i
indeed
he
answered
she
never
comes
commandering
it
over
me
and
i
not
going
to
meddle
with
her
private
affairs
so
long
as
she
does
come
here
bringing
infection
that
all
but
she
may
catch
the
disease
herself
and
die
of
it
or
be
disfigured
for
life
i
remonstrated
and
she
might
catch
her
death
of
cold
here
in
the
garden
or
be
burnt
beyond
all
recognition
by
a
spark
setting
fire
to
her
the
next
time
she
wears
one
he
answered
philosophically
when
you
look
at
the
chances
now
they
about
equal
he
smiled
at
me
complacently
when
he
had
said
this
and
something
he
saw
in
my
face
inclined
him
to
chuckle
but
he
suppressed
the
inclination
twirling
his
fair
moustache
instead
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
rapidly
in
his
youth
he
must
have
been
one
of
those
small
boys
who
delighted
to
spear
a
bee
with
a
pin
and
watch
it
buzz
round
the
boy
is
pretty
sure
the
bee
ca
hurt
him
but
yet
half
the
pleasure
of
the
performance
lies
in
the
fact
of
its
having
a
sting
it
would
not
have
been
convenient
for
colonel
colquhoun
to
quarrel
with
me
because
there
had
been
certain
money
transactions
between
us
which
left
him
greatly
my
debtor
but
he
thought
me
secured
by
my
interest
in
evadne
and
indulged
himself
on
every
possible
occasion
in
the
pleasure
of
opposing
me
not
that
he
bore
me
any
either
i
knew
that
he
would
borrow
more
money
from
me
at
any
time
in
the
friendliest
way
if
he
happened
to
want
it
i
was
his
honey
bee
and
he
was
fond
of
honey
but
it
delighted
him
also
to
see
me
buzz
i
was
obliged
to
consider
my
own
patients
and
keep
away
from
the
camp
during
the
epidemic
for
fear
of
carrying
infection
and
consequently
i
saw
nothing
of
evadne
and
only
heard
of
her
through
the
military
doctor
for
she
would
not
write
his
report
of
her
however
was
always
the
same
at
first
she
was
the
life
of
the
camp
bright
cheerful
and
active
never
tired
apparently
and
never
disheartened
this
went
on
for
some
time
and
then
one
evening
there
came
another
report
she
was
just
as
cheerful
as
ever
but
looking
most
awfully
done
at
daybreak
next
morning
i
drove
out
to
the
common
and
leaving
my
dogcart
outside
the
camp
went
in
to
look
for
her
i
knew
that
she
was
generally
up
all
night
and
was
therefore
prepared
to
find
her
about
and
i
met
her
making
her
way
toward
her
own
tent
she
was
dressed
like
a
french
in
a
short
dark
blue
gown
made
of
some
washing
material
with
a
white
apron
and
white
cap
and
a
châtelaine
with
useful
implements
upon
it
hanging
from
her
girdle
a
very
suitable
costume
for
the
work
but
she
wore
no
wrap
of
any
kind
and
the
morning
air
was
keen
i
noticed
as
she
walked
toward
me
that
her
gait
was
a
little
uncertain
once
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
seeking
something
to
grasp
and
once
she
staggered
and
stopped
i
hastened
to
her
assistance
and
saw
as
i
approached
her
that
she
was
colourless
even
to
her
lips
her
eyes
were
bright
and
sunken
with
large
black
circles
round
them
and
the
lids
were
heavy
i
drew
her
hand
through
my
arm
without
more
formal
greeting
and
she
grasped
it
gratefully
for
a
moment
then
dropped
it
and
stepped
back
i
forgot
she
said
it
seems
so
natural
to
see
you
anywhere
but
touch
me
i
shall
infect
you
i
shall
have
to
go
home
and
change
in
any
case
i
answered
briskly
i
been
up
all
night
with
a
poor
woman
she
said
and
i
just
tired
out
do
look
concerned
though
i
shall
not
take
my
own
illness
you
remember
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
and
i
am
sure
the
absorbing
distraction
of
helping
to
relieve
others
she
stopped
short
looked
about
her
confusedly
and
then
exclaimed
it
is
quite
time
i
went
to
bed
i
declare
i
do
know
the
hospital
tent
from
the
sandy
common
nor
a
rabbit
running
about
from
a
convalescent
child
and
the
whin
bushes
are
waltzing
round
me
derisively
she
swayed
a
little
recovered
herself
tried
to
laugh
then
threw
up
her
hands
and
fell
forward
into
my
arms
i
carried
her
to
her
tent
guided
by
one
of
the
men
on
the
way
james
joined
us
we
laid
her
on
her
bed
and
looked
anxiously
for
symptoms
of
the
dreadful
disease
but
there
were
none
no
you
see
james
declared
it
just
what
i
expected
sheer
exhaustion
and
nothing
else
but
she
better
be
got
out
of
this
atmosphere
at
once
she
was
in
a
state
half
syncope
half
sleep
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
rousing
her
just
then
so
we
wrapped
her
up
warmly
in
shawls
sent
for
my
dogcart
and
lifted
her
on
the
back
seat
where
i
supported
her
as
best
i
could
while
my
man
drove
us
to
colonel
golquhoun
was
not
up
when
we
arrived
but
i
waited
to
see
her
swallow
some
champagne
after
she
had
been
put
to
bed
and
in
the
meantime
the
bustle
had
aroused
him
when
he
learnt
the
occasion
of
it
his
wrath
knew
no
bounds
he
could
not
have
abused
me
in
choicer
language
if
i
had
been
one
of
his
own
subalterns
but
i
managed
to
keep
my
temper
until
i
could
get
a
word
in
and
then
i
mildly
suggested
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
as
he
was
so
afraid
of
infection
was
to
give
himself
leave
and
be
off
nobody
will
expect
to
stay
and
look
after
your
wife
i
said
you
better
go
to
town
it
was
what
he
would
have
done
if
i
had
not
advised
it
but
the
habit
of
opposing
me
was
becoming
so
inveterate
that
he
changed
his
mind
and
rather
than
act
upon
a
suggestion
of
mine
ran
the
risk
of
living
in
barracks
until
all
fear
of
infection
was
over
happily
evadne
suffered
from
nothing
worse
than
exhaustion
and
soon
recovered
her
strength
but
i
never
could
agree
with
james
about
the
merit
of
her
conduct
during
the
epidemic
chapter
x
it
was
about
this
time
that
is
to
say
immediately
after
the
outbreak
of
was
over
and
in
the
height
of
the
summer
that
and
lady
adeline
returned
from
a
prolonged
absence
abroad
and
settled
themselves
for
a
few
months
at
hamilton
house
i
happened
to
be
in
london
when
they
arrived
and
saw
them
there
as
they
passed
through
lady
adeline
made
particular
inquiries
about
evadne
i
do
think
you
any
of
you
understand
that
girl
she
said
she
is
shy
and
should
be
set
going
she
requires
to
be
to
come
forward
to
do
her
share
of
the
work
of
the
world
but
instead
of
helping
her
everybody
lets
her
alone
to
mope
in
luxurious
idleness
at
she
is
never
idle
i
protested
i
know
what
you
mean
lady
adeline
answered
she
sits
and
sews
but
that
is
idle
trifling
for
a
woman
of
her
capacity
she
was
out
of
health
and
when
i
saw
her
last
with
orton
beg
in
paris
and
therefore
i
held
my
peace
but
now
i
mean
to
take
her
out
of
herself
and
show
her
her
mistake
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
do
so
i
said
and
i
was
not
speaking
ironically
but
all
the
same
i
scarcely
expected
that
she
would
succeed
the
day
after
my
return
home
however
which
was
only
a
week
later
i
called
at
hamilton
house
and
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
she
had
already
made
a
very
good
beginning
it
was
a
brilliant
afternoon
and
i
had
walked
through
the
fields
from
fountain
towers
and
found
lady
adeline
alone
for
the
moment
sitting
out
on
the
terrace
under
an
awning
somewhat
overcome
by
the
heat
you
have
arrived
at
an
acceptable
time
as
you
always
do
she
said
in
her
decided
kindly
way
i
am
enjoying
a
brief
period
of
repose
before
the
racket
begins
again
and
i
invite
you
to
share
it
the
racket
i
inquired
no
the
repose
she
replied
angelica
is
staying
here
and
evadne
colquhoun
and
racket
i
ejaculated
well
it
is
difficult
to
associate
the
two
ideas
i
confess
she
answered
but
you
will
see
for
yourself
angelica
makes
the
racket
of
course
but
evadne
enjoys
it
i
went
to
as
soon
as
i
could
without
waiting
for
her
to
call
upon
me
and
i
found
her
just
as
you
had
led
me
to
expect
all
staid
propriety
and
precision
hiding
deep
dejection
beneath
an
affectation
of
calm
content
at
least
that
was
my
interpretation
of
her
attitude
and
inclined
to
be
stiff
with
me
but
i
approached
her
as
her
mother
oldest
and
dearest
friend
and
she
softened
at
once
and
you
brought
her
here
that
is
quite
the
proper
word
for
it
she
rejoined
i
just
brought
her
i
insisted
upon
her
coming
i
gave
her
no
choice
and
i
also
asked
colonel
colquhoun
but
he
declined
he
said
he
thought
evadne
would
be
all
the
better
for
getting
away
from
home
and
i
agreed
with
him
he
comes
over
however
occasionally
and
they
seem
to
be
very
good
friends
i
dislike
him
at
all
this
was
said
tentatively
but
i
did
not
care
to
discuss
colonel
colquhoun
and
therefore
to
change
the
subject
i
asked
lady
adeline
how
she
found
angelica
very
much
improved
in
every
way
she
answered
the
happiest
understanding
has
come
to
exist
between
herself
and
her
husband
since
that
dreadful
occurrence
they
are
simply
inseparable
she
said
to
me
the
other
day
that
her
only
chance
of
ever
showing
to
any
advantage
at
all
would
be
against
the
quiet
background
of
her
husband
unobtrusive
goodness
and
i
think
myself
that
a
great
many
people
would
never
have
believed
in
her
if
he
had
not
all
her
faults
are
so
apparent
alas
while
the
very
real
and
earnest
purpose
of
her
life
is
so
seldom
seen
she
has
been
working
very
hard
lately
i
believe
yes
lady
adeline
answered
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
she
has
set
up
a
private
secretary
and
who
do
you
think
it
is
our
dear
good
mr
ellis
i
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
of
it
i
said
both
for
his
sake
and
hers
yes
she
agreed
it
did
not
seem
right
that
he
should
ever
go
away
from
amongst
us
and
you
know
how
we
all
felt
the
severance
after
diavolo
went
into
the
service
and
there
seemed
no
help
for
it
as
his
occupation
was
over
i
am
afraid
poor
fellow
his
experiences
since
he
left
us
have
been
anything
but
happy
all
that
is
over
now
however
and
it
does
seem
so
natural
to
have
him
about
again
he
must
make
an
admirable
secretary
i
said
admirable
she
agreed
in
every
way
for
i
do
think
angelica
would
ever
have
got
on
quite
so
well
with
anybody
else
he
was
always
able
to
make
her
respect
him
and
now
the
habit
is
confirmed
so
that
he
has
more
influence
with
her
for
good
than
almost
anybody
else
a
restraining
influence
you
know
her
great
fault
still
is
impatience
she
thinks
everything
should
be
put
right
the
moment
she
perceives
it
to
be
wrong
and
would
raise
revolutions
if
she
were
not
restrained
it
is
always
difficult
to
make
her
believe
that
evolution
if
slower
is
surer
but
here
they
are
as
lady
adeline
spoke
angelica
accompanied
by
kilroy
and
ellis
came
out
of
the
plantation
to
the
left
of
the
terrace
upon
which
we
were
sitting
and
walked
across
the
lawn
toward
us
while
at
the
same
moment
diavolo
and
evadne
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
from
the
opposite
direction
and
went
to
meet
them
evadne
carried
a
parasol
but
wore
neither
hat
nor
gloves
she
looked
very
happy
listening
to
chatter
angelica
carried
a
fishing
rod
and
i
thought
as
she
approached
that
i
had
never
seen
a
more
splendid
specimen
of
hardy
healthy
vigorous
young
womanhood
evadne
looked
sickly
beside
her
and
drooping
like
a
pale
and
fragile
flower
in
want
of
water
the
contrast
must
have
struck
lady
adeline
also
for
presently
she
observed
evadne
was
as
strong
as
angelica
once
do
you
suppose
her
health
has
been
permanently
injured
by
that
horrid
maltese
fever
no
i
said
positively
if
she
would
give
up
sewing
and
take
a
fishing
rod
and
go
out
with
angelica
in
a
sensible
dress
like
that
she
would
be
as
strong
as
ever
in
six
months
but
i
fancy
she
would
be
shocked
by
the
bare
suggestion
angelica
hugged
diavolo
heartily
when
they
met
and
then
being
the
taller
of
the
two
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
all
three
strolled
slowly
on
toward
us
ellis
and
kilroy
having
already
come
up
on
to
the
terrace
and
sat
down
while
greeting
the
two
latter
i
lost
sight
of
the
heavenly
twins
and
when
i
looked
at
them
again
something
had
evidently
gone
wrong
angelica
stood
leaning
on
her
rod
berating
diavolo
who
was
answering
with
animation
while
evadne
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
amazement
as
the
strange
good
child
looks
at
the
strange
naughty
ones
whatever
the
difference
was
it
was
soon
over
and
then
they
came
on
again
talking
and
walking
briskly
followed
by
four
dogs
i
vulgar
decidedly
at
times
angelica
acknowledged
as
she
came
up
the
steps
i
should
be
half
so
amusing
if
i
were
not
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
and
then
threw
herself
into
the
only
unoccupied
chair
on
the
terrace
but
instantly
jumped
up
again
i
beg
your
pardon
evadne
she
said
these
are
my
society
manners
when
i
am
on
the
platform
or
otherwise
engaged
in
pursuits
outside
the
sphere
i
have
to
be
more
considerate
some
more
chairs
were
brought
out
one
of
which
diavolo
placed
beside
me
this
is
for
you
he
said
to
evadne
i
know
you
like
to
be
near
the
don
evadne
flushed
crimson
did
you
ever
hear
that
story
angelica
asked
me
evadne
embarrassment
visibly
increased
angelica
do
tell
it
she
remonstrated
it
is
fair
angelica
laughed
when
evadne
first
came
here
she
proceeded
she
sat
next
you
at
dinner
one
night
and
did
know
who
you
were
but
it
seems
you
made
such
a
profound
and
favourable
impression
upon
her
that
afterward
she
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
when
she
learnt
that
you
were
a
doctor
doctor
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
is
more
like
a
don
than
a
doctor
and
you
have
been
to
her
intimates
ever
since
well
i
feel
flattered
i
said
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
apologise
evadne
began
only
i
meant
no
disrespect
my
dear
angelica
interposed
he
is
delighted
to
be
distinguished
by
you
in
any
way
but
by
the
pricking
of
my
thumbs
something
wicked
and
colonel
colquhoun
came
out
on
to
the
terrace
through
the
drawing
room
behind
us
he
shook
hands
with
us
all
his
wife
included
and
then
sat
down
i
say
evadne
diavolo
began
my
dear
boy
said
lady
adeline
you
must
call
colquhoun
by
her
christian
name
christian
jeered
diavolo
now
that
a
good
one
nothing
christian
about
evadne
we
looked
her
up
in
the
dictionary
ages
ago
did
we
angelica
the
name
means
as
nearly
as
possible
and
it
suits
her
sometimes
evadne
classical
evadne
was
noted
for
her
devotion
to
her
husband
and
distinguished
herself
finally
on
his
funeral
pyre
she
there
we
all
groaned
aloud
it
was
a
somewhat
theatrical
exit
i
confess
diavolo
pursued
but
i
say
angelica
would
it
be
fun
to
burn
the
colonel
and
see
evadne
do
suttee
on
his
body
only
i
doubt
if
she
would
he
turned
to
evadne
colquhoun
he
began
ceremoniously
may
i
have
the
honour
of
calling
you
by
your
heathen
name
as
in
the
days
beyond
recalling
when
you
are
good
she
answered
ugh
he
exclaimed
i
should
have
had
more
respect
for
your
honesty
if
you
said
at
once
and
it
is
very
absurd
of
you
too
evadne
because
you
know
you
are
going
to
marry
me
when
colonel
colquhoun
is
promoted
to
regions
of
the
blest
she
would
have
married
me
first
only
you
stole
a
march
on
me
sir
he
added
addressing
colonel
colquhoun
however
i
feel
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
at
last
there
was
a
banshee
wailing
about
my
quarters
in
a
minor
key
very
flat
last
night
she
had
come
all
the
way
from
ireland
to
warn
colonel
colquhoun
and
mistaken
the
house
i
suppose
my
dear
we
all
looked
round
it
was
addressing
lady
adeline
in
his
most
precise
manner
he
was
standing
in
the
open
french
window
just
behind
us
tapping
one
hand
with
the
he
held
in
the
other
my
dear
the
cat
has
five
kittens
my
lady
adeline
exclaimed
they
have
only
just
arrived
and
never
mind
them
she
cried
hurriedly
but
my
dear
you
were
anxious
to
know
i
do
want
to
know
in
the
least
she
protested
but
only
this
morning
you
said
oh
that
was
upstairs
she
interrupted
what
difference
does
that
make
he
wanted
to
know
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
anxious
about
the
cat
when
you
are
upstairs
and
not
anxious
when
you
come
down
lady
adeline
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
resigned
herself
to
a
long
altercation
before
it
ended
everybody
else
had
disappeared
and
i
saw
no
more
of
evadne
on
that
occasion
but
during
the
next
few
weeks
i
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
wonderful
way
she
was
waking
up
under
the
influence
of
the
heavenly
twins
they
gave
her
no
time
for
reflection
it
was
the
life
of
action
against
the
life
of
thought
and
it
suited
her
the
ladies
frequently
made
my
house
the
object
of
an
afternoon
walk
and
stayed
for
tea
lady
adeline
declared
that
the
girls
dragged
her
over
because
they
wanted
a
new
victim
to
torment
with
their
superabundant
animal
spirits
the
superabundance
was
all
angelica
i
knew
but
still
evadne
was
an
accomplice
and
they
neither
of
them
spared
me
in
those
days
they
would
rob
my
of
the
best
fruits
and
flowers
disarrange
my
books
turn
pictures
they
did
not
like
with
their
faces
to
the
wall
drape
my
statues
fantastically
criticise
what
they
called
my
absurd
bachelor
habits
and
give
me
good
advice
on
the
subject
of
marriage
lady
adeline
sitting
by
meanwhile
aiding
and
abetting
them
with
smiles
although
protesting
that
she
would
not
allow
them
to
make
me
the
butt
of
their
idle
raillery
evadne
had
a
passion
for
the
scent
of
gorse
she
crammed
pockets
sleeves
shoes
and
the
bosom
of
her
dress
with
the
yellow
blossoms
and
i
often
found
these
fragrant
tokens
of
her
presence
scattered
about
my
house
after
she
had
been
there
once
when
we
were
all
out
walking
together
she
stopped
to
pick
some
from
a
bush
and
as
she
was
putting
them
into
her
bodice
she
made
a
remark
which
gave
me
pause
to
ponder
you
will
want
to
know
why
i
do
that
i
suppose
she
said
you
will
be
looking
for
a
motive
for
some
secret
spring
of
action
the
simple
fact
that
i
love
the
gorse
wo
satisfy
you
you
would
like
to
know
why
i
love
it
when
i
first
began
to
love
it
and
anything
else
about
it
that
might
enable
you
to
measure
my
feeling
for
it
this
was
so
exactly
what
i
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
with
regard
to
many
matters
that
i
could
not
say
a
word
but
what
struck
me
as
significant
about
the
observation
was
the
obvious
fact
gathered
by
inference
that
while
i
had
been
studying
her
she
also
had
been
studying
me
and
i
had
never
suspected
it
she
walked
on
with
angelica
after
she
had
spoken
and
i
dropped
behind
with
lady
adeline
evadne
and
colonel
colquhoun
wife
are
two
very
different
people
i
said
the
one
is
a
lively
girl
the
other
a
sad
and
bitter
woman
sad
not
bitter
lady
adeline
corrected
i
have
heard
her
say
bitter
things
i
maintained
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
her
condemn
wrong
ones
rather
too
emphatically
lady
adeline
suggested
but
all
this
is
only
a
phase
she
is
in
rather
a
deep
groove
at
present
but
we
shall
be
able
to
get
her
out
of
it
i
do
know
i
answered
dubiously
i
do
think
it
is
that
exactly
i
believe
there
is
some
kind
of
warp
in
her
mind
i
perceive
it
but
can
neither
define
nor
account
for
it
yet
it
is
something
morbid
that
makes
her
hold
herself
aloof
she
has
never
allowed
anybody
in
the
neighbourhood
to
be
intimate
with
her
even
i
who
have
seen
her
oftener
than
anybody
never
feel
that
i
know
her
really
well
that
i
could
reckon
upon
what
she
would
do
in
an
emergency
and
i
believe
that
there
is
something
artificial
in
her
attitude
but
why
what
is
the
explanation
of
all
that
is
unusual
about
her
lady
adeline
shook
her
head
and
was
silent
for
some
seconds
then
she
said
i
once
had
a
friend
but
her
moral
nature
quite
halted
it
was
because
she
had
lost
her
faith
in
men
a
woman
who
thinks
that
only
women
can
be
worthy
is
like
a
bird
with
a
broken
wing
but
i
do
say
that
that
is
evadne
case
at
all
since
she
came
to
us
she
has
seemed
to
be
much
more
like
one
of
those
marvellous
casks
of
sherry
out
of
which
a
dozen
different
wines
are
taken
the
flavour
depends
on
the
doctoring
here
under
angelica
influence
why
she
has
filled
your
pocket
with
gorse
blossoms
it
was
true
in
taking
out
my
handkerchief
i
had
just
scattered
the
flowers
and
so
discovered
that
they
were
there
then
you
give
her
credit
for
less
individuality
you
think
her
more
at
the
mercy
of
her
surroundings
than
i
do
i
said
but
before
she
could
answer
me
evadne
herself
had
joined
us
i
suppose
i
was
looking
grave
for
she
asked
in
a
playful
tone
did
he
ever
frolic
lady
adeline
this
solemn
seeming
was
he
always
in
earnest
even
on
his
mother
lap
and
occupied
with
weighty
problems
of
life
and
death
when
other
babes
were
wondering
with
wide
open
eyes
at
the
irresponsible
action
of
their
own
pink
toes
which
made
me
reflect
for
if
i
were
in
the
habit
of
being
a
dull
bore
myself
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
seldom
saw
her
looking
lively
the
following
week
evadne
went
home
and
as
soon
as
she
was
settled
at
she
seemed
to
relapse
once
more
into
her
former
state
of
apathy
i
saw
her
day
after
day
as
i
passed
sitting
sewing
in
the
wide
west
window
above
the
holly
hedge
and
so
long
as
she
was
left
alone
she
seemed
to
be
content
but
i
began
to
notice
at
this
time
that
any
interruption
at
her
favourite
occupation
did
not
please
her
the
summer
heat
the
scent
of
flowers
streaming
through
open
windows
the
song
of
birds
the
level
landscape
here
vividly
green
with
the
upspringing
aftermath
there
crimson
and
gold
where
the
poppies
gleamed
amongst
the
ripening
corn
all
such
sweet
sensuous
influences
she
looked
out
upon
lovingly
and
enjoyed
them
so
long
as
she
was
left
alone
on
hot
afternoons
diavolo
would
go
and
lie
at
her
feet
sometimes
with
a
cushion
under
his
head
and
him
she
tolerated
but
only
i
am
sure
because
he
always
fell
asleep
i
had
to
go
to
one
day
to
transact
some
business
with
colonel
colquhoun
and
when
we
had
done
he
asked
me
to
go
up
into
the
drawing
room
with
him
come
and
i
show
you
a
pretty
picture
he
said
it
a
pretty
picture
they
had
both
fallen
asleep
on
that
occasion
it
was
a
torrid
day
outside
but
the
deep
bay
where
they
were
was
cool
and
shady
the
windows
were
wide
open
the
outside
blinds
were
drawn
down
low
enough
to
keep
out
the
glare
but
not
so
far
as
to
hide
the
view
behind
evadne
was
a
stand
of
flowers
and
foliage
plants
diavolo
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
his
favourite
attitude
with
a
black
satin
cushion
under
his
head
and
was
with
his
slender
figure
refined
features
thick
curly
fair
hair
and
fine
transparent
skin
slightly
flushed
by
the
heat
a
perfect
specimen
of
adolescent
grace
and
beauty
he
looked
like
a
young
lover
lying
at
the
feet
of
his
lady
evadne
was
sitting
in
a
low
easy
chair
with
a
high
back
against
which
her
head
was
resting
half
her
face
was
concealed
by
a
fan
of
white
ostrich
feathers
which
she
held
in
her
left
hand
and
the
moment
i
looked
at
her
the
haunting
certainty
of
having
seen
her
in
exactly
that
position
once
before
recurred
to
me
she
was
looking
well
that
afternoon
her
glossy
dark
brown
hair
showed
bright
as
bronze
against
the
satin
background
of
the
chair
she
was
dressed
in
a
gown
of
silver
gray
cashmere
lined
with
turquoise
blue
silk
which
showed
between
the
folds
cool
colours
of
the
best
shade
to
set
off
the
ivory
whiteness
of
her
skin
colonel
colquhoun
considered
the
group
meditatively
she
keeps
her
looks
he
observed
in
an
undertone
and
diavolo
catching
her
up
i
looked
at
him
inquiringly
she
six
or
eight
years
older
than
he
is
you
know
he
explained
but
you
would
think
it
now
i
wondered
what
he
had
in
his
mind
times
are
changing
he
proceeded
now
when
i
was
a
lad
if
a
lady
had
liked
me
as
well
as
evadne
likes
that
boy
i
have
taken
advantage
of
her
preference
not
if
the
lady
had
been
of
her
stamp
i
said
drily
well
true
for
you
he
acknowledged
but
it
is
the
lady
only
in
this
case
it
that
young
sybarite
himself
he
as
particular
as
she
is
he
said
the
other
day
at
mess
it
was
a
guest
night
and
there
was
a
big
dinner
on
and
somebody
proposed
and
women
for
a
toast
but
he
would
drink
it
spare
me
he
said
in
that
slow
way
he
has
something
like
his
father
and
women
as
you
take
them
are
things
as
coarse
in
the
way
of
pleasure
as
pork
and
porter
are
for
food
we
asked
him
then
to
give
us
his
own
ideas
of
pleasure
but
he
said
he
think
anybody
there
was
educated
up
to
them
even
sufficiently
to
understand
them
and
he
was
joking
altogether
either
colonel
colquhoun
concluded
at
that
same
moment
evadne
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
looked
at
us
a
second
before
she
spoke
but
showed
no
other
sign
of
surprise
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
asleep
she
said
rising
deliberately
and
shaking
hands
with
me
across
the
prostrate
diavolo
do
sit
down
she
sank
back
into
her
own
chair
as
she
spoke
and
fanned
a
fly
from
diavolo
face
i
never
knew
anyone
sleep
so
soundly
she
said
looking
down
at
him
lovingly
he
rides
out
here
nearly
every
day
when
he
is
not
on
duty
simply
for
his
siesta
angelica
is
jealous
i
believe
because
he
will
not
go
to
her
he
says
there
is
no
repose
about
angelica
and
that
it
is
only
here
with
me
that
he
finds
the
dreamful
ease
he
loves
there
was
a
sound
of
talking
outside
just
then
and
a
few
minutes
later
angelica
herself
came
in
with
her
father
oh
you
you
a
pretty
boy
she
exclaimed
when
she
saw
diavolo
and
then
she
went
down
on
her
knees
beside
him
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
pulled
him
up
and
hugged
him
roughly
an
attention
which
he
immediately
resented
ah
i
thought
it
was
you
he
said
opening
his
eyes
sweet
sleep
then
he
sat
up
and
turning
his
back
to
evadne
coolly
rested
himself
against
her
knee
i
suppose
we
can
have
tea
now
he
said
there
always
something
to
look
forward
to
papa
dear
touch
the
bell
to
save
the
colonel
the
trouble
colonel
colquhoun
laughed
and
rang
it
himself
diavolo
evadne
exclaimed
pushing
him
away
i
am
not
going
to
nurse
a
great
boy
like
you
well
angelica
must
then
he
said
changing
his
position
so
as
to
lean
against
his
sister
angelica
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
and
her
face
softened
evadne
to
like
to
nurse
me
he
complained
not
nearly
so
nice
since
she
married
i
say
angelica
do
you
remember
the
wedding
breakfast
when
we
agreed
to
drink
as
much
champagne
as
the
bridegroom
i
swore
i
would
never
get
drunk
again
and
i
never
have
faith
said
colonel
colquhoun
there
are
some
who
like
to
be
able
to
say
the
same
thing
some
dogs
had
followed
angelica
in
and
had
now
to
be
turned
out
because
evadne
would
not
have
dogs
indoors
she
said
she
liked
a
good
character
but
could
not
bear
the
smell
of
him
and
how
are
the
children
asked
affably
when
this
diversion
was
over
there
are
no
children
evadne
exclaimed
in
surprise
are
there
not
indeed
now
that
is
singular
he
observed
then
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
about
to
say
something
interesting
but
i
hastily
interposed
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
speculate
about
the
natural
history
of
the
phenomenon
which
had
just
struck
him
as
being
singular
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
evadne
had
no
children
but
he
was
subject
or
affected
to
be
subject
to
moments
of
obliviousness
in
which
he
was
wont
to
ask
embarrassing
questions
the
weather
is
quite
tropical
was
the
original
observation
i
made
felt
if
the
parting
of
his
smooth
straight
hair
was
exactly
in
the
middle
patted
it
on
either
side
then
shook
back
imaginary
ruffles
from
his
long
white
hands
and
interlaced
his
jewelled
fingers
on
his
lap
you
were
never
in
the
tropics
i
think
you
told
me
he
said
to
evadne
with
exaggerated
preciseness
ah
now
i
have
been
off
and
on
several
times
the
heat
is
very
trying
i
knew
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
colonial
governor
who
used
to
be
so
overcome
by
it
that
she
was
obliged
to
undo
all
her
things
let
them
slip
to
the
ground
and
step
out
of
them
leaving
them
looking
like
a
great
cheese
she
told
me
so
herself
i
assure
you
and
she
was
an
exceedingly
stout
person
the
heavenly
twins
went
into
convulsions
suddenly
is
that
tea
at
last
evadne
asked
colonel
colquhoun
and
i
both
gladly
moved
to
make
room
for
the
servants
who
were
bringing
it
in
and
the
conversation
was
not
resumed
until
they
had
withdrawn
then
angelica
began
i
came
to
make
a
last
appeal
to
you
evadne
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
poor
girl
oh
do
break
this
lovely
summer
silence
with
tales
of
woe
evadne
exclaimed
interrupting
her
i
can
not
do
anything
do
ask
me
you
harrow
my
feelings
to
no
purpose
i
will
not
listen
it
is
not
right
that
i
should
be
forced
to
know
well
i
think
you
are
making
a
mistake
evadne
angelica
replied
you
think
so
looking
at
me
she
is
sacrificing
herself
to
save
herself
she
imagines
she
can
secure
her
own
peace
of
mind
by
refusing
to
know
that
there
is
a
weary
world
of
suffering
close
at
hand
which
she
should
be
helping
to
relieve
suffering
for
others
strengthens
our
own
powers
of
endurance
we
lose
them
if
we
do
exercise
them
and
that
is
the
way
you
are
sacrificing
yourself
to
save
yourself
evadne
when
some
big
trouble
of
your
own
one
of
those
which
can
not
be
denied
comes
upon
you
it
will
crush
you
you
will
have
lost
the
moral
muscle
you
should
be
exercising
now
to
keep
it
in
good
working
order
and
develop
it
well
for
your
own
use
when
you
require
it
it
would
not
be
worse
for
you
to
take
a
stimulant
or
a
sedative
to
wind
yourself
up
to
an
artificially
pleasurable
state
when
at
any
time
you
are
not
naturally
cheerful
and
that
is
what
a
too
great
love
of
peace
occasionally
ends
in
evadne
waved
her
ostrich
feather
fan
backward
and
forward
slowly
and
looked
out
of
the
window
she
would
not
even
listen
to
this
friendly
counsel
and
i
felt
sure
she
was
making
a
mistake
i
only
saw
her
once
again
that
summer
under
lady
adeline
salutary
influence
it
was
a
few
days
later
and
evadne
was
in
an
expansive
mood
she
had
been
spending
the
day
with
lady
adeline
and
the
two
had
been
for
a
drive
together
and
had
overtaken
me
on
the
road
and
picked
me
up
on
their
way
back
to
hamilton
house
i
had
been
for
a
solitary
ramble
and
was
then
returning
to
work
but
evadne
said
i
must
go
back
to
tea
with
them
for
your
own
sake
because
it
is
a
shame
to
waste
a
summer
day
in
work
a
glorious
summer
day
so
evidently
sent
for
our
enjoyment
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
is
to
be
in
perfect
condition
for
the
work
one
loves
i
answered
but
i
was
settling
myself
comfortably
in
the
carriage
as
i
spoke
such
is
the
consistency
of
man
but
indeed
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
persuade
me
to
idle
that
afternoon
i
had
been
inclining
that
way
for
weeks
under
the
influence
of
the
intoxicating
heat
doubtless
and
presently
when
i
found
myself
comfortably
seated
on
the
wide
stone
terrace
outside
the
great
drawing
room
at
hamilton
house
under
a
shady
awning
looking
down
upon
lawns
vividly
green
and
lovely
gardens
all
aglow
with
colour
and
alive
with
perfume
which
is
the
soul
of
the
flowers
i
yielded
sensuous
service
to
the
hour
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
it
unreservedly
was
there
making
tea
in
the
precisest
manner
and
looking
more
puritanical
than
ever
how
to
reconcile
his
coldly
formal
exterior
with
the
interior
from
which
emanated
his
choice
of
subjects
in
conversation
is
a
matter
which
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
study
although
i
am
convinced
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
would
prove
to
be
of
great
scientific
value
and
importance
i
was
not
in
the
habit
of
thinking
of
him
as
either
a
man
or
a
woman
myself
however
but
as
a
specimen
of
humanity
broadly
and
domestically
as
a
husband
whom
i
always
suspected
of
being
a
sharp
sword
of
the
law
although
i
had
never
obtained
the
slightest
evidence
of
the
fact
lady
adeline
was
lolling
in
a
low
cane
chair
fatigued
by
her
drive
and
longing
aloud
for
tea
and
evadne
was
flitting
about
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
laughing
and
talking
more
than
any
of
us
she
was
wearing
an
art
gown
very
becoming
to
her
and
suitable
also
for
such
sultry
weather
as
remarked
i
suppose
you
are
a
strong
supporter
of
the
ćsthetic
dress
movement
he
said
doubtless
alluding
to
the
graceful
freedom
of
her
delicate
primrose
draperies
not
at
all
she
answered
seating
herself
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
near
lady
adeline
and
opening
her
fan
gently
as
she
spoke
i
was
inspired
to
ask
for
more
tea
just
then
poured
it
out
and
handed
it
to
me
you
take
milk
he
informed
me
but
no
sugar
then
he
folded
his
hands
and
recommenced
to
return
to
the
original
point
of
departure
he
began
which
was
modern
dress
if
i
remember
rightly
he
smiled
round
upon
us
all
knowing
quite
well
that
he
remembered
rightly
that
brings
us
by
an
obvious
route
to
another
question
of
the
day
i
mean
the
position
of
women
how
do
you
regard
their
position
at
this
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
evadne
i
do
not
regard
it
at
all
if
i
can
help
it
she
answered
incisively
dropped
his
outspread
hands
upon
his
knees
if
i
remember
rightly
he
said
you
take
no
interest
in
politics
either
that
is
quite
a
phenomenon
at
this
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
have
my
duties
the
duties
of
my
social
position
you
know
she
answered
and
my
own
little
pursuits
as
well
neither
of
which
i
can
neglect
for
the
affairs
of
the
world
but
are
they
enough
for
you
lady
adeline
ventured
evadne
glanced
up
to
see
what
she
meant
and
then
smiled
the
wisdom
of
ages
is
brought
to
the
training
of
each
little
girl
she
said
and
to
fit
her
for
our
position
she
is
taught
that
a
woman
one
object
in
life
is
to
be
agreeable
you
mean
that
a
woman
of
decided
opinions
is
not
an
agreeable
person
lady
adeline
asked
decided
opinions
must
always
be
offensive
to
those
who
do
hold
them
evadne
rejoined
a
woman
must
know
that
the
future
welfare
of
her
own
sex
and
the
progress
of
the
world
at
large
depends
upon
the
action
of
women
now
and
the
success
attending
it
angelica
observed
comprehensively
yes
but
she
knows
also
that
her
own
comfort
and
convenience
depend
entirely
on
her
neutrality
evadne
answered
it
is
not
to
be
neutral
i
know
when
it
is
put
in
that
way
but
a
woman
who
is
so
becomes
exactly
what
the
average
man
taken
at
his
word
would
have
her
be
and
he
is
we
are
assured
the
proper
person
to
legislate
she
looked
at
us
all
defiantly
as
she
spoke
and
furled
her
fan
and
just
at
that
moment
colonel
colquhoun
joined
us
he
had
come
to
fetch
her
and
his
entrance
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
conversation
it
has
been
oppressively
hot
all
day
he
observed
yes
lady
adeline
answered
and
i
do
so
long
for
the
mountains
in
weather
like
this
oh
do
you
said
evadne
are
you
subject
to
the
magnet
of
the
mountains
i
am
not
i
do
not
want
to
feel
the
nothingness
of
man
i
like
to
believe
in
his
greatness
in
his
infinite
possibilities
i
like
to
think
of
life
as
a
level
plain
over
which
we
can
gallop
to
some
goal
i
do
know
what
but
something
desirable
and
the
actual
landscape
pleases
me
best
so
the
great
tumbled
mountains
make
me
melancholy
they
are
always
foreboding
something
untoward
even
at
the
best
of
times
but
the
open
spaces
windswept
and
evident
i
love
them
i
am
at
home
on
them
i
can
breathe
there
i
am
free
this
was
the
natural
woman
at
last
in
her
aspirations
unconsciously
showing
herself
superior
to
the
artificial
creature
she
was
trying
to
be
i
hate
the
melancholy
mountains
the
angelica
burst
forth
i
loathe
the
inconstant
sea
the
breezy
plain
for
a
gallop
it
is
there
that
one
feels
free
colonel
colquhoun
looked
at
evadne
meditatively
and
slowly
twisted
each
end
of
his
heavy
blond
moustache
i
have
seen
you
riding
for
some
time
now
he
said
and
it
a
pity
for
you
a
fine
seat
on
a
horse
i
was
obliged
to
make
up
that
night
for
the
time
lost
in
the
afternoon
and
the
dawn
had
broken
when
at
last
i
put
my
work
away
i
opened
the
study
windows
wider
to
salute
it
a
lark
was
singing
somewhere
out
of
sight
die
lerche
die
im
augen
nicht
doch
immer
in
den
ohren
ist
and
the
ripples
of
undecipherable
sound
struck
some
equally
inarticulate
chord
of
sense
and
fell
with
association
the
breeze
murmurous
amongst
the
branches
set
the
leaves
rustling
like
silk
attire
did
i
imagine
it
or
was
there
really
a
faint
sweet
perfume
of
yellow
gorse
in
the
air
a
thrush
on
a
bough
below
began
to
flute
softly
trying
its
tones
before
it
burst
forth
giving
full
voice
to
its
enthusiasm
in
one
clear
call
eloquent
of
life
and
love
and
longing
and
all
expressed
in
just
three
notes
crotchet
quaver
crotchet
and
rest
which
shortly
shaped
themselves
to
a
word
in
my
heart
a
word
of
just
three
syllables
the
accent
being
on
the
penultimate
good
heavens
i
roused
myself
not
a
proper
state
of
mind
certainly
for
a
man
of
my
years
and
pursuits
why
how
old
was
i
not
so
old
in
one
way
yet
ten
years
older
at
least
than
stop
sickly
sentimentality
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
there
must
be
no
dreams
of
scented
gorse
of
posing
in
daffodil
draperies
for
me
must
take
a
holiday
and
rest
take
my
agreeable
ugliness
off
i
was
amused
when
the
heavenly
twins
told
me
their
mother
talked
of
my
agreeable
ugliness
but
now
did
i
like
it
no
i
was
cynical
when
i
said
it
take
my
agreeable
ugliness
off
to
the
mountains
turn
thine
eyes
unto
the
mountains
the
magnet
of
the
mountains
yes
i
felt
it
i
delighted
to
do
so
i
was
not
morbid
to
the
mountains
to
the
cold
which
stays
corruption
the
snows
which
are
pure
and
the
eternal
silence
by
ten
that
night
i
was
well
on
my
way
chapter
xi
i
went
abroad
that
year
for
my
holiday
but
spent
the
last
week
of
it
in
london
on
my
way
home
all
the
vapours
of
sentimentality
had
disappeared
by
that
time
my
nerves
had
been
braced
in
the
alps
my
mind
had
been
calmed
and
refreshed
by
the
warm
blue
mediterranean
my
sense
of
comparison
emphasized
in
egypt
where
i
perceived
anew
the
law
of
mutability
the
inevitable
law
by
the
decree
of
which
the
human
race
is
eternal
while
we
its
constituent
atoms
have
but
a
moment
of
intensity
to
blaze
and
burn
out
perishable
life
and
permanent
matter
are
we
with
a
limit
that
may
be
prolonged
in
idea
by
such
circumstances
as
we
can
dwell
on
with
delight
one
day
being
longer
in
the
record
than
whole
monotonous
years
it
is
good
to
live
and
love
but
if
we
possess
the
burden
of
life
unrelieved
by
the
blessing
of
love
or
the
hope
of
it
well
why
despair
man
is
matter
animated
by
a
series
of
emotions
the
majority
of
which
are
pleasurable
disappointment
ends
like
success
and
the
futile
dust
of
nations
offers
itself
in
evidence
of
the
vanity
of
all
attributes
except
wisdom
the
wisdom
that
teaches
us
to
accept
the
inevitable
silently
and
endure
our
moment
with
equally
undemonstrative
acquiescence
whether
it
comes
full
fraught
with
the
luxury
of
living
or
only
brings
us
that
which
causes
us
to
contemplate
of
necessity
and
without
shrinking
the
crowning
dignity
of
death
i
had
come
back
ready
for
work
and
could
have
cheerfully
dispensed
with
that
week
delay
in
london
but
i
had
promised
it
to
an
old
friend
in
failing
health
whom
i
would
not
disappoint
the
people
at
morne
the
kilroys
the
the
colquhouns
all
my
circle
of
intimate
friends
had
fallen
into
the
background
of
my
recollection
during
my
tour
abroad
but
now
again
when
i
found
myself
so
near
them
the
old
habitual
interests
began
to
be
dominant
i
had
sent
notes
to
apologize
for
not
wishing
them
before
my
sudden
departure
but
i
had
not
written
to
any
of
them
or
heard
from
them
during
my
absence
and
did
not
know
where
they
might
all
be
at
the
moment
and
i
was
just
wondering
one
night
as
i
walked
toward
piccadilly
from
the
direction
of
the
strand
i
was
just
wondering
if
they
were
all
as
i
had
left
them
if
the
civil
war
as
angelica
called
it
was
being
waged
as
actively
as
ever
between
herself
and
evadne
upon
the
point
and
that
made
me
think
of
evadne
herself
i
had
banished
her
name
from
my
mind
for
weeks
but
now
some
inexplicable
trick
of
the
brain
suddenly
set
her
before
me
as
i
oftenest
saw
her
sitting
at
work
in
the
wide
west
window
overlooking
the
road
and
glancing
up
brightly
at
the
sound
of
my
horse
hoofs
or
carriage
wheels
as
i
rode
or
drove
past
to
salute
me
a
lady
might
wait
and
watch
so
at
accustomed
hours
for
her
lover
but
he
would
stop
and
she
would
open
the
window
and
lean
out
with
a
flower
in
her
hand
for
him
and
perhaps
she
would
kiss
it
before
she
tossed
it
to
him
and
he
would
catch
it
and
go
on
his
way
rejoicing
a
pretty
poetical
dream
and
easy
of
fulfilment
if
only
one
could
find
the
lady
suitably
circumstanced
i
had
arrived
at
piccadilly
circus
by
this
time
at
the
turn
into
regent
street
where
the
omnibuses
stop
and
was
delayed
for
a
moment
or
two
by
the
casual
crowd
of
loiterers
and
people
struggling
for
places
and
by
those
who
were
alighting
from
the
various
vehicles
not
being
in
any
hurry
myself
it
amused
me
to
observe
the
turmoil
the
play
of
human
emotion
which
appeared
distinctly
on
the
faces
of
those
who
approached
me
and
were
lost
to
sight
again
as
soon
as
seen
in
the
eddy
and
whirl
of
the
crowd
there
was
temper
here
and
tenderness
there
this
person
was
steadily
bent
on
business
that
on
pleasure
and
one
fussy
little
man
escorting
his
family
somewhere
was
making
the
former
of
the
latter
there
were
two
young
lovers
alone
with
their
love
so
far
as
any
outward
consciousness
of
the
crowd
was
concerned
and
there
was
a
young
wife
silent
and
sad
beside
a
neglectful
elderly
husband
it
was
the
from
the
west
end
i
was
watching
one
had
just
moved
off
toward
the
strand
and
another
pulled
up
in
its
place
and
the
people
began
to
alight
a
fat
man
first
in
a
frenzy
of
haste
a
sallow
priest
whose
soul
seemed
to
sicken
at
the
sight
of
the
seething
mass
of
humanity
amongst
which
he
found
himself
for
he
hesitated
perceptibly
on
the
step
like
a
child
in
a
bathing
machine
who
shrinks
from
the
water
before
he
descended
and
was
engulfed
in
the
crowd
a
musician
with
his
instrument
in
a
case
two
fat
women
talking
to
each
other
a
little
cockney
and
her
young
man
and
then
a
lady
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
her
social
status
the
conductor
standing
by
the
step
recognized
it
at
once
and
held
out
his
arm
to
assist
her
the
gaslight
flared
full
upon
her
face
the
expression
of
which
was
somewhat
set
she
wore
no
veil
and
if
she
did
not
court
observation
she
certainly
did
not
shun
it
she
was
quietly
but
richly
dressed
and
had
one
seen
her
there
on
foot
in
the
morning
one
would
have
surmised
that
she
was
out
shopping
and
looked
for
the
carriage
which
would
probably
have
been
following
her
but
a
lady
striking
in
appearance
and
of
distinguished
bearing
alighting
composedly
from
an
omnibus
at
piccadilly
circus
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
and
calmly
taking
her
way
alone
up
regent
street
was
a
sight
which
would
have
struck
one
as
being
anomalous
even
if
she
had
been
a
stranger
but
this
lady
was
no
stranger
to
me
i
should
have
recognized
her
figure
and
carriage
had
her
countenance
been
concealed
i
had
turned
hot
and
cold
at
the
first
foreshadowing
of
her
presence
and
would
fain
have
found
myself
mistaken
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
doubt
she
passed
me
without
haste
and
so
close
that
i
could
have
laid
my
hand
upon
her
shoulder
but
i
let
her
go
in
sheer
astonishment
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
inexplicable
was
evadne
doing
there
alone
at
that
time
of
night
such
a
proceeding
was
hardly
decent
whatever
her
excuse
and
it
was
certainly
not
safe
this
last
reflection
aroused
me
and
i
started
instantly
to
follow
her
intending
to
overtake
her
and
impose
my
escort
upon
her
she
was
out
of
sight
because
she
had
turned
the
corner
but
she
could
not
have
gone
far
and
i
hurried
headlong
after
her
nearly
upsetting
a
man
who
met
me
face
to
face
as
i
doubled
into
regent
street
it
was
colonel
colquhoun
himself
in
a
joyful
mood
evidently
and
for
once
i
could
have
blessed
his
blinding
potations
he
recognized
me
but
had
apparently
passed
evadne
ah
me
boy
you
here
he
exclaimed
with
an
assumption
of
facetious
particularly
distasteful
to
me
all
the
world
lives
in
london
i
think
it
where
you
always
come
across
anyone
you
want
sly
dog
following
a
lady
i
be
bound
by
jove
i
would
have
thought
it
of
you
galbraith
but
you
not
find
anything
choice
in
regent
street
come
with
me
and
i
introduce
you
excuse
me
i
interrupted
and
hurried
away
from
the
brute
how
had
he
missed
evadne
perhaps
he
was
looking
the
other
way
but
what
a
position
for
her
to
be
in
supposing
he
had
recognized
her
my
being
so
close
would
have
made
it
none
the
better
for
her
and
could
i
be
sure
that
he
had
not
seen
her
i
did
not
think
he
was
the
kind
of
man
with
all
his
faults
to
lay
a
trap
even
for
an
enemy
whom
he
suspected
but
still
one
never
knows
evadne
was
far
ahead
by
this
time
but
the
places
of
amusement
were
still
open
and
therefore
there
were
few
people
in
regent
street
it
is
not
particularly
well
lighted
but
i
was
soon
near
enough
to
make
her
out
by
her
graceful
dignified
carriage
which
contrasted
markedly
with
that
of
every
other
woman
and
girl
i
saw
in
any
other
place
her
bearing
would
have
struck
me
as
that
of
a
person
accustomed
to
consideration
even
if
i
had
not
known
her
but
here
judging
by
the
confident
way
she
held
her
head
up
i
should
have
been
inclined
to
set
her
down
either
as
a
most
abandoned
person
or
as
one
who
was
quite
unconscious
of
anything
peculiar
in
her
present
proceedings
in
another
respect
too
she
was
very
unlike
the
women
and
girls
who
were
loitering
about
the
street
peering
up
anxiously
into
the
face
of
every
man
they
met
evadne
seemed
to
see
no
one
and
passed
on
her
way
superbly
indifferent
to
any
attention
she
might
be
attracting
the
distance
between
us
had
lessened
considerably
and
i
could
now
have
overtaken
her
easily
but
i
hesitated
i
could
not
decide
whether
it
would
be
better
to
join
her
or
merely
to
keep
her
in
sight
for
her
own
safety
i
was
inclined
to
blame
her
severely
for
her
recklessness
she
had
already
passed
her
husband
and
might
meet
half
the
depôt
or
be
recognized
by
heaven
knows
who
before
she
got
to
the
top
of
the
street
and
as
it
was
she
was
attracting
considerable
attention
scarcely
a
man
met
her
who
did
not
turn
when
he
had
passed
and
look
after
her
and
anyone
of
these
might
be
an
acquaintance
my
impulse
had
been
to
insist
upon
her
getting
into
a
hansom
and
allowing
me
to
see
her
safe
home
but
it
had
occurred
to
me
upon
reflection
that
i
might
compromise
her
more
fatally
by
being
seen
with
her
under
such
circumstances
than
could
happen
if
she
went
alone
while
i
hesitated
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
gray
beard
whom
i
thought
i
recognized
from
photographs
seen
in
shop
windows
met
her
stared
hard
as
he
passed
stood
a
minute
looking
after
her
and
then
turned
and
followed
her
if
he
were
the
man
i
took
him
to
be
he
would
probably
know
her
and
my
first
impression
was
that
he
did
so
and
had
recognised
her
and
been
like
myself
too
astonished
to
speak
if
so
he
quickly
recovered
himself
and
as
he
evidently
intended
to
address
her
now
i
was
half
inclined
to
resign
my
responsibility
to
him
then
i
thought
that
if
i
joined
her
also
nothing
could
be
said
two
men
of
known
repute
may
escort
a
lady
anywhere
and
at
any
time
i
quickened
my
steps
but
purposely
let
him
speak
first
coming
up
with
her
from
behind
he
began
in
a
tone
which
was
more
caressing
than
respectful
it
is
a
fine
night
he
said
evadne
started
visibly
looked
at
him
and
shrank
two
steps
away
but
she
answered
in
a
voice
which
i
could
hardly
recognise
as
hers
it
was
so
high
and
strident
i
should
call
it
a
chilly
night
she
said
well
yes
perhaps
he
answered
for
the
time
of
the
year
are
you
going
for
a
walk
i
i
do
know
she
replied
looking
doubtfully
on
ahead
she
was
walking
at
a
pretty
rapid
rate
as
it
was
and
her
elderly
interlocutor
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
her
perhaps
if
we
turned
down
one
of
these
side
streets
to
the
left
it
would
be
quieter
and
we
could
talk
he
suggested
i
do
think
i
want
either
to
be
quiet
or
to
talk
she
said
suddenly
recovering
her
natural
voice
and
tone
well
what
do
you
want
then
he
asked
she
looked
up
at
him
and
slackened
her
speed
perhaps
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
trouble
yourself
about
me
at
all
she
said
i
may
venture
to
ask
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
where
in
london
i
am
his
manner
instantly
changed
you
are
in
regent
street
he
answered
and
that
lighted
place
behind
us
where
the
crowd
is
what
is
that
you
must
mean
piccadilly
circus
and
if
i
walk
on
what
shall
i
come
to
oxford
street
you
do
seem
to
know
london
do
you
live
here
i
do
not
live
in
london
you
have
lost
your
way
perhaps
can
i
direct
you
anywhere
no
thank
you
she
answered
i
can
get
into
a
hansom
you
know
when
i
am
tired
of
this
if
i
might
venture
to
advise
i
should
say
do
so
at
once
he
rejoined
slightly
raising
his
hat
as
he
spoke
and
then
he
slipped
behind
her
and
furtively
hurried
across
the
street
a
considerably
perplexed
man
i
fancied
and
judging
by
the
way
he
peered
to
right
and
left
as
he
went
one
who
was
suffering
from
some
sudden
dislike
to
being
recognised
evadne
paid
as
little
heed
to
his
departure
as
she
had
done
to
his
approach
a
few
steps
farther
brought
her
to
a
stand
of
hansom
cabs
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
got
into
one
i
took
the
next
and
directed
the
driver
to
follow
her
being
determined
either
to
see
her
back
to
her
friends
or
to
interfere
if
i
found
that
she
meant
to
continue
her
ramble
her
driver
struck
into
piccadilly
at
the
next
turn
and
then
drove
steadily
west
for
about
half
an
hour
by
that
time
we
had
come
to
a
row
of
handsome
houses
at
one
of
which
he
stopped
and
my
man
stopped
also
at
an
intelligent
distance
behind
but
evadne
never
looked
back
she
got
out
and
ascended
the
steps
with
the
leisurely
air
peculiar
to
her
the
door
was
opened
as
soon
as
she
rang
and
she
entered
a
moment
later
a
footman
came
out
on
to
the
pavement
and
paid
the
driver
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
remark
or
two
as
he
returned
the
light
from
the
hall
streamed
out
upon
him
and
i
saw
with
a
sense
of
relief
which
made
me
realise
what
the
previous
tension
had
been
that
he
wore
the
livery
and
then
i
recognised
the
town
house
the
driver
of
the
now
empty
hansom
turned
his
horse
and
walked
him
slowly
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
the
incident
was
over
but
what
did
it
all
mean
the
whole
thing
seemed
so
purposeless
what
had
taken
her
out
at
all
was
it
some
jealous
freak
women
have
confessed
to
me
that
they
watch
their
husbands
habitually
one
said
she
did
it
for
love
of
excitement
there
was
always
a
risk
of
being
caught
and
nothing
else
ever
amused
her
half
so
much
another
declared
she
did
it
because
she
could
not
afford
to
employ
a
private
detective
and
she
wanted
to
have
evidence
always
ready
in
case
it
should
suit
her
to
part
from
her
husband
at
any
time
another
said
she
loved
her
husband
and
it
hurt
her
less
to
know
than
to
suspect
but
i
could
not
really
believe
that
evadne
would
do
such
a
thing
for
any
reason
whatever
she
was
fearlessly
upright
and
honest
about
her
actions
and
her
would
have
restrained
her
if
ever
an
isolated
impulse
had
impelled
her
to
such
a
proceeding
but
still
will
you
wait
until
the
lady
returns
sir
the
driver
asked
at
last
peeping
down
upon
me
through
the
trap
in
the
roof
if
he
had
not
spoken
i
might
have
sat
there
half
the
night
puzzling
out
the
problem
now
however
that
he
had
roused
me
i
determined
to
leave
it
for
the
present
i
remembered
my
duty
to
the
friend
with
whom
i
was
staying
and
hurried
back
resolving
to
go
to
evadne
herself
next
day
and
ask
her
point
blank
to
explain
i
believed
she
would
do
so
for
in
all
that
concerned
her
own
pursuits
the
doings
of
the
day
i
had
always
found
her
almost
curiously
frank
after
this
wise
determination
i
ought
to
have
been
philosopher
enough
to
sleep
upon
the
matter
but
her
ladyship
escapade
cost
me
my
night
rest
and
took
me
to
her
early
next
morning
in
an
angry
and
irritable
mood
i
sent
up
my
card
and
evadne
received
me
at
once
in
lady
boudoir
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
she
said
how
did
you
know
i
was
in
town
i
saw
you
in
regent
street
last
night
i
answered
bluntly
what
were
you
doing
there
what
were
you
doing
there
yourself
she
said
the
question
took
me
aback
completely
and
the
more
so
as
it
was
asked
with
an
unmistakable
flash
of
merriment
answer
me
my
question
first
i
said
you
could
have
no
business
out
alone
in
london
at
that
time
of
night
laying
yourself
open
to
insult
i
do
recognise
your
right
to
question
me
at
all
she
answered
unabashed
i
have
the
right
of
any
gentleman
who
does
his
duty
when
he
sees
a
lady
making
a
fool
of
herself
thanks
she
said
laughing
the
privilege
of
protecting
a
woman
of
saving
her
even
in
spite
of
herself
from
the
effects
of
her
own
indiscretion
is
one
of
which
a
man
seldom
avails
himself
and
i
did
not
understand
you
at
first
excuse
me
but
how
do
you
know
i
could
have
no
business
out
at
that
time
of
night
do
you
imagine
that
you
know
all
my
duties
in
life
i
was
bewildered
by
her
confidence
by
her
levity
i
may
say
but
i
persisted
i
can
not
believe
that
you
had
any
business
or
duty
which
necessitated
your
being
in
a
disreputable
part
of
london
alone
late
at
night
i
said
but
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
the
right
of
an
intimate
friend
to
warn
you
if
you
run
risks
in
your
ignorance
or
to
reprove
me
if
i
do
so
with
my
eyes
open
she
suggested
to
ask
for
an
explanation
at
all
events
if
i
do
not
understand
what
your
motive
could
be
you
are
very
kind
she
said
you
want
me
to
excuse
myself
if
i
can
otherwise
you
will
be
forced
to
suspect
something
unjustifiable
that
is
the
literal
truth
i
answered
she
laughed
but
you
have
not
answered
question
she
said
what
were
you
doing
there
yourself
i
had
been
dining
at
the
charing
cross
hotel
with
a
friend
who
had
just
returned
from
india
i
told
her
and
i
was
walking
back
to
the
house
of
the
friend
with
whom
i
am
staying
he
lives
in
a
street
off
piccadilly
but
what
were
you
doing
in
regent
street
following
you
she
laughed
again
did
you
see
that
old
man
speak
to
me
she
asked
yes
horrid
old
creature
is
he
not
he
gave
me
such
a
start
did
you
recognise
him
yes
i
did
not
at
first
but
when
i
did
i
thought
i
would
make
him
useful
she
meditated
for
a
little
then
she
said
it
did
me
good
what
i
asked
that
start
she
replied
it
quite
roused
me
but
now
tell
me
i
should
never
have
supposed
that
you
had
no
business
anywhere
at
any
time
why
are
you
not
equally
charitable
i
was
silent
tell
me
what
you
think
took
me
there
an
unholy
curiosity
i
blurted
out
that
is
an
unholy
inspiration
which
has
only
just
occurred
to
you
and
you
can
not
entertain
the
suspicion
for
a
moment
she
said
this
was
true
but
after
all
she
pursued
what
business
have
you
to
take
me
to
task
like
this
it
is
not
a
professional
matter
i
do
know
that
i
answered
this
was
another
inspiration
and
it
disconcerted
her
for
she
changed
countenance
you
have
a
nice
opinion
of
me
she
exclaimed
i
have
the
highest
opinion
of
you
i
answered
and
nobody
knows
that
better
than
yourself
but
what
am
i
to
think
when
i
find
you
acting
without
any
discretion
whatever
think
that
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
every
wayward
impulse
but
i
know
that
you
are
not
i
replied
and
i
am
unhappy
about
you
will
you
trust
me
will
you
explain
will
you
let
me
help
you
if
i
can
i
believe
there
is
some
trouble
at
the
bottom
of
this
business
do
tell
me
all
about
it
well
i
explain
she
said
still
laughing
i
was
driving
past
and
seeing
you
there
i
thought
i
would
horrify
you
so
i
stopped
the
carriage
you
got
out
of
an
omnibus
i
exclaimed
well
that
was
my
carriage
for
the
time
being
she
answered
in
no
way
disconcerted
you
do
not
expect
me
to
own
that
i
was
in
an
omnibus
do
you
i
wish
you
would
be
serious
for
a
moment
i
remonstrated
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
the
truth
as
i
always
do
tell
the
truth
if
i
tell
anything
i
think
we
had
better
let
the
subject
drop
she
said
with
a
sigh
as
if
she
were
tired
of
it
you
mean
you
can
not
tell
me
that
is
what
i
mean
i
reflected
for
a
moment
does
lady
adeline
know
that
you
were
out
last
night
i
asked
no
she
replied
she
was
out
herself
and
i
returned
before
she
did
then
you
have
not
told
her
either
she
shook
her
head
i
would
really
rather
you
confided
in
her
than
in
me
if
you
can
thank
you
she
answered
drily
can
you
i
persisted
no
i
can
not
was
the
positive
rejoinder
i
rose
to
go
forgive
my
officiousness
i
said
i
ventured
to
hope
you
would
make
use
of
me
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
forcing
my
services
upon
you
too
persistently
she
rose
impulsively
and
held
out
both
hands
to
me
i
wish
i
could
thank
you
she
said
looking
up
at
me
frankly
and
affectionately
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
much
i
appreciate
your
goodness
to
me
and
all
your
disinterestedness
i
wish
i
deserved
it
she
clasped
my
hands
warmly
as
she
spoke
then
dropped
them
and
instantly
i
became
conscious
of
an
indescribable
sense
of
relief
and
prepared
to
depart
at
once
but
she
stopped
me
again
with
a
word
as
i
opened
the
door
galbraith
she
began
with
another
flash
of
merriment
tell
me
you
horrified
now
were
you
not
i
jammed
my
hat
on
my
head
and
left
her
i
did
not
mean
to
slam
the
door
but
her
levity
had
annoyed
me
i
fancied
her
laughing
as
i
descended
the
stairs
and
wondered
at
her
mood
and
yet
i
was
by
it
she
would
not
have
been
so
merry
if
there
had
been
anything
really
wrong
and
it
was
just
possible
that
the
half
explanation
she
had
given
me
and
withdrawn
was
the
true
one
she
might
have
been
in
an
omnibus
for
once
for
some
quite
legitimate
reason
and
while
it
waited
at
piccadilly
circus
she
might
have
seen
me
as
she
had
described
and
got
out
in
a
moment
of
mischief
to
astonish
me
if
that
were
her
object
she
had
certainly
succeeded
and
it
seemed
to
me
more
likely
than
that
she
should
just
have
gone
and
returned
for
the
sake
of
doing
an
unusual
thing
which
was
the
only
other
explanation
that
occurred
to
me
i
saw
lady
adeline
before
i
left
the
house
and
found
that
colonel
colquhoun
was
not
staying
with
them
nor
did
she
seem
to
know
that
he
had
been
in
town
chapter
xii
a
cruel
misfortune
robbed
me
of
a
near
relation
at
this
time
and
added
the
rank
of
baronet
with
a
considerable
increase
of
fortune
to
my
other
responsibilities
the
increase
of
fortune
was
welcome
in
one
way
as
it
enabled
me
to
enlarge
a
small
private
hospital
which
i
had
established
on
my
fountain
towers
estate
for
the
benefit
of
poor
patients
attending
to
these
and
to
the
buildings
which
were
at
once
put
in
progress
was
the
one
absorbing
interest
of
my
life
at
that
time
during
the
next
three
months
i
only
called
once
on
evadne
and
that
was
a
mere
formal
visit
which
i
felt
in
duty
bound
to
pay
her
i
did
not
drive
past
the
house
either
oftener
than
i
could
help
but
when
i
was
obliged
to
go
that
way
i
saw
her
sitting
sewing
in
her
accustomed
place
and
she
would
smile
and
bow
to
me
brightly
at
first
but
after
a
time
with
a
wistful
weary
expression
or
i
fancied
so
it
was
of
necessity
a
hurried
glimpse
that
i
had
although
my
horse
would
slacken
his
speed
of
his
own
accord
as
we
approached
the
holly
hedge
that
bounded
her
bower
but
i
began
to
be
uneasily
aware
of
a
change
in
her
appearance
i
might
be
mistaken
but
i
certainly
thought
her
eyes
looked
unnaturally
large
as
if
her
cheeks
had
fallen
away
and
the
little
patient
face
was
paler
in
the
early
summer
when
she
was
well
she
had
been
wont
to
flush
upon
the
least
occasion
but
now
her
colour
did
not
vary
and
i
suspected
that
she
was
again
shutting
herself
up
too
much
orton
beg
was
at
fraylingay
diavolo
was
keeping
his
grandfather
company
at
morne
the
kilroys
were
in
town
the
had
gone
to
egypt
and
colonel
colquhoun
had
taken
two
months
leave
and
gone
abroad
also
so
that
she
had
no
one
near
her
for
whom
she
had
any
special
regard
colonel
colquhoun
had
called
on
me
before
he
left
and
told
me
he
was
sure
evadne
would
hope
to
see
a
good
deal
of
me
during
his
absence
and
he
wished
i
would
look
after
her
professionally
i
inferred
and
of
course
i
was
always
prepared
to
do
so
but
so
far
she
had
not
required
my
services
happily
and
for
the
rest
well
my
time
was
fully
occupied
and
i
found
it
did
not
suit
me
to
go
to
when
i
noticed
the
change
in
her
appearance
however
i
began
to
think
i
would
look
in
some
day
just
to
see
how
she
really
was
but
before
i
could
carry
out
the
half
formed
intention
she
came
to
me
it
was
during
my
consulting
hours
and
i
was
sitting
at
my
writing
table
seeing
my
patients
in
rotation
when
her
name
was
announced
she
sauntered
in
in
her
usual
leisurely
way
shook
hands
with
me
and
then
subsided
into
the
on
my
right
which
was
placed
facing
the
window
for
my
patients
to
occupy
i
have
a
cold
she
said
and
a
pain
under
my
right
clavicle
and
the
posterior
lobe
of
my
brain
oh
dear
i
have
forgotten
it
all
she
broke
off
laughing
how
i
make
you
understand
you
are
in
excellent
spirits
i
observed
if
you
are
not
in
very
good
health
no
believe
me
she
answered
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
enlivened
me
for
a
moment
but
i
am
really
rather
down
i
had
been
considering
her
attentively
from
a
professional
point
of
view
while
she
was
speaking
and
saw
that
this
was
true
the
brightness
which
animated
her
when
she
entered
faded
immediately
and
then
i
saw
that
her
face
was
thin
and
pale
and
anxious
in
expression
her
eyes
wandered
somewhat
restlessly
her
attitude
betokened
weakness
she
had
a
little
worrying
cough
and
her
pulse
was
unequal
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
lately
i
asked
turning
to
my
writing
table
and
taking
up
a
pen
when
i
had
ascertained
this
last
fact
dreaming
she
said
the
answer
struck
me
dreaming
i
repeated
to
myself
and
then
aloud
to
her
while
i
affected
to
write
dreaming
i
said
what
about
for
example
oh
the
arabian
nights
the
whole
thousand
and
one
of
them
would
not
be
long
enough
to
tell
you
she
replied
i
think
my
dreams
have
lasted
longer
already
are
you
speaking
of
i
asked
yes
you
imagine
things
as
you
sit
at
work
perhaps
yes
she
spoke
languidly
and
evidently
attached
no
special
significance
either
to
my
questions
or
her
own
answers
which
was
what
i
wished
yes
that
is
my
best
time
while
i
work
i
live
in
a
world
of
my
own
creating
in
a
beautiful
happy
dream
at
least
it
was
so
once
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
have
heard
you
say
you
did
not
care
to
read
fiction
you
prefer
to
make
your
own
stories
is
that
the
reason
i
suppose
so
she
said
but
i
never
thought
of
it
before
and
you
never
write
these
imaginings
oh
no
that
would
be
impossible
it
is
in
the
tones
of
voices
as
i
hear
them
in
the
expression
of
faces
as
i
see
them
in
the
subtle
indescribable
perception
of
the
significance
of
events
and
their
intimate
relation
to
each
other
and
influence
on
the
lives
of
my
dream
friends
that
the
whole
charm
lies
such
impressions
are
too
delicate
for
reproduction
even
if
i
had
the
mind
to
try
describing
them
would
be
as
coarse
a
proceeding
as
eating
a
flower
after
inhaling
its
perfume
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
is
the
habit
of
years
has
your
inner
life
been
composed
of
dreams
ever
since
you
were
a
child
no
she
replied
i
do
think
as
a
child
i
was
at
all
imaginative
i
liked
to
learn
and
when
i
was
not
learning
i
lived
an
active
outdoor
life
ah
then
you
have
acquired
the
habit
since
you
grew
up
yes
it
came
on
by
degrees
i
used
to
think
of
how
things
might
be
different
that
was
the
way
it
began
i
tried
to
work
out
schemes
of
life
in
my
head
as
i
would
do
a
game
of
chess
not
schemes
of
life
for
myself
you
know
but
such
as
should
save
other
people
from
being
very
miserable
i
wanted
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
she
paused
here
to
choose
her
words
and
that
kind
of
thought
naturally
resolves
itself
into
action
but
before
the
impulse
to
act
came
upon
me
i
had
made
it
impossible
for
myself
to
do
anything
so
that
when
it
came
i
was
obliged
to
resist
it
and
then
instead
of
reading
and
reflecting
i
took
to
sewing
for
a
sedative
and
turned
the
trick
of
thinking
how
things
might
be
different
into
another
channel
she
was
unconsciously
telling
me
the
history
of
her
married
life
showing
me
a
lonely
woman
gradually
losing
her
mental
health
for
want
of
active
occupation
and
a
wholesome
share
of
the
work
of
the
world
to
take
her
out
of
herself
to
a
certain
extent
then
i
had
been
right
in
my
judgment
of
her
character
her
disposition
was
practical
not
contemplative
but
she
had
been
forced
into
the
latter
attitude
and
the
consequence
was
perhaps
well
it
might
be
a
diseased
state
of
the
mind
but
that
i
had
yet
to
ascertain
and
are
you
happy
in
your
dreams
i
inquired
i
was
she
said
but
my
dreams
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
how
i
asked
at
first
they
were
pleasant
she
answered
when
i
sat
alone
at
work
it
was
my
happiest
time
i
was
master
of
my
dreams
then
and
let
none
but
pleasant
shapes
present
themselves
but
by
degrees
i
do
know
how
i
began
to
be
intoxicated
my
imagination
ran
away
with
me
instead
of
indulging
in
a
daydream
now
and
then
when
i
liked
all
my
life
became
absorbed
in
delicious
imaginings
whether
i
would
or
not
working
walking
driving
in
church
anywhere
and
at
any
time
when
i
could
be
alone
a
moment
i
lived
in
my
world
apart
if
people
spoke
to
me
i
awoke
and
answered
them
but
real
life
was
a
dull
thing
to
offer
and
the
daylight
very
dim
compared
with
the
movement
and
brightness
of
the
land
i
lived
in
while
i
was
master
of
my
dreams
then
you
did
not
remain
master
of
them
always
no
by
degrees
they
mastered
me
and
now
i
am
their
puppet
and
they
are
demons
that
torment
me
when
i
awake
in
the
morning
i
wonder
what
the
haunting
thought
for
the
day
will
be
and
before
i
have
finished
dressing
it
is
upon
me
as
a
rule
at
first
it
was
not
incessant
but
now
the
trouble
in
my
head
is
awful
i
thought
so
but
she
had
said
enough
for
the
present
the
confession
was
ingenuously
made
and
evidently
without
intention
i
merely
asked
a
few
more
questions
about
her
general
health
and
then
sent
her
home
to
nurse
her
cold
promising
to
call
and
see
how
it
was
the
next
day
when
i
opened
my
case
book
to
make
a
note
of
her
visit
and
a
brief
summary
of
the
symptoms
she
had
described
and
betrayed
i
hesitated
a
moment
about
the
diagnosis
and
finally
decided
to
write
provisionally
for
my
guidance
or
rather
by
way
of
prognosis
the
one
word
hysteria
chapter
xiii
next
day
i
found
that
evadne
cold
was
decidedly
worse
and
as
the
weather
was
severe
i
ordered
her
to
stay
in
her
own
rooms
am
i
going
to
be
ill
she
asked
no
i
answered
the
notion
doctor
you
dash
my
hopes
she
said
i
am
always
happy
when
i
am
ill
it
such
a
relief
i
had
heard
her
use
the
phrase
twice
before
but
it
was
only
now
that
i
saw
her
meaning
physical
suffering
was
evidently
a
relief
from
the
mental
misery
and
this
proved
that
the
trouble
was
of
longer
standing
than
i
had
at
first
suspected
she
had
used
the
same
expression
i
remembered
when
i
first
attended
her
during
that
severe
attack
of
pneumonia
colonel
colquhoun
had
returned
she
told
me
but
i
did
not
see
him
that
day
as
he
was
out
next
morning
however
i
came
earlier
on
purpose
and
encountered
him
in
the
hall
he
was
not
in
uniform
i
was
thankful
to
see
for
he
was
very
apt
to
assume
his
orderly
room
manners
therewith
and
they
were
decidedly
objectionable
to
the
average
civilian
whatever
military
men
might
think
of
them
ah
how
do
you
do
he
said
so
you
been
having
honours
thrust
upon
you
well
i
congratulate
you
i
sure
sincerely
in
so
far
as
they
are
a
pleasure
to
you
but
i
condole
with
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
your
loss
i
afraid
colquhoun
is
giving
you
more
trouble
now
do
say
the
trouble
a
pleasure
for
i
not
believe
a
word
of
it
with
all
you
have
to
occupy
you
it
is
no
pleasure
to
see
her
ill
i
answered
how
is
she
on
my
word
i
ca
tell
you
because
i
have
seen
her
i
have
the
to
her
private
apartments
but
come
and
see
my
new
horse
he
broke
off
he
was
in
an
exceedingly
good
humour
i
got
him
in
ireland
and
i
inclined
to
think
him
a
beauty
but
i
like
to
have
your
opinion
it
worth
having
the
horse
was
like
colonel
colquhoun
himself
showy
one
of
those
high
steppers
that
put
their
feet
down
where
they
lift
them
up
almost
and
get
over
no
ground
at
all
to
speak
of
having
occupied
without
compunction
in
inspecting
this
animal
half
an
hour
of
the
time
he
considered
too
precious
to
be
wasted
on
his
wife
colonel
colquhoun
summoned
maid
to
show
me
upstairs
and
cheerfully
went
his
way
but
that
remark
of
his
about
the
to
his
wife
apartments
had
made
an
impression
i
was
in
duty
bound
to
follow
up
any
clue
to
the
cause
of
her
present
state
of
mind
and
here
was
perhaps
a
morbid
symptom
why
have
you
quarrelled
with
your
husband
i
asked
in
my
most
tone
as
soon
as
i
was
seated
and
had
heard
about
her
cold
i
have
not
quarrelled
with
my
husband
she
answered
evidently
surprised
then
what
does
he
mean
by
saying
that
he
has
the
to
your
private
apartments
i
am
sure
he
made
no
complaint
about
that
she
answered
tranquilly
this
was
true
he
had
merely
mentioned
the
fact
casually
and
not
as
a
thing
that
affected
his
comfort
or
happiness
in
any
way
colonel
colquhoun
and
i
are
better
friends
now
if
anything
than
we
have
ever
been
she
added
of
her
own
accord
with
inquiry
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
wanted
to
know
what
could
have
made
me
think
otherwise
i
should
have
said
myself
that
they
were
excellent
friends
but
what
precisely
did
friends
mean
i
scented
something
anomalous
here
however
it
was
not
a
point
that
i
considered
it
advisable
to
pursue
i
had
ascertained
that
there
was
no
morbid
feeling
in
the
matter
and
that
was
all
that
i
required
to
know
i
only
paid
her
a
short
visit
that
morning
and
did
not
return
for
two
days
but
i
had
been
thinking
seriously
about
her
case
in
the
interval
and
carefully
prepared
to
inquire
into
it
particularly
and
an
evident
increase
of
languor
and
depression
gave
me
a
good
opening
tell
me
how
you
are
i
began
any
trouble
the
worry
in
my
head
is
awful
she
exclaimed
let
me
go
downstairs
i
am
better
there
she
was
essentially
a
child
of
light
and
air
and
movement
requiring
sunshine
indoors
as
well
as
out
to
keep
her
in
health
an
italian
proverb
says
where
the
sun
does
not
come
the
doctor
does
and
this
had
been
only
too
true
in
her
case
it
was
pure
animal
instinct
which
had
made
the
west
window
of
the
drawing
room
her
favourite
place
nature
animal
and
vegetable
is
under
an
imperative
law
to
seek
the
sun
and
she
had
unconsciously
obeyed
it
for
her
own
good
but
she
required
more
than
that
transient
gleam
in
the
western
window
a
sun
bath
daily
when
it
could
be
had
is
what
i
should
have
prescribed
for
her
and
from
her
next
remark
i
judged
that
she
had
discovered
for
herself
the
harm
which
the
deprivation
of
light
was
doing
her
i
can
see
the
sun
all
day
long
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
house
she
continued
but
i
want
to
feel
it
too
i
would
like
it
to
shine
on
me
in
the
early
morning
and
wake
me
up
and
warm
me
there
is
no
heat
so
grateful
and
i
only
feel
half
alive
in
these
dark
damp
rooms
i
never
had
bronchitis
or
was
delicate
at
all
in
any
way
until
we
came
here
let
me
go
down
wo
you
well
as
your
cold
is
so
much
better
you
may
go
downstairs
if
you
like
but
you
must
go
out
i
answered
how
are
you
going
to
amuse
yourself
oh
she
looked
around
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
something
i
know
exactly
work
i
suppose
you
do
read
much
no
not
now
she
answered
leaning
forward
with
her
hands
clasped
on
her
lap
and
looking
dreamily
into
the
fire
does
that
mean
that
you
used
to
read
once
i
pursued
you
have
plenty
of
books
here
she
looked
toward
the
cases
yes
she
said
old
friends
i
seldom
open
any
of
them
now
do
you
never
feel
that
they
reproach
you
for
losing
interest
in
them
she
smiled
i
think
perhaps
they
are
relieved
because
i
have
ceased
from
troubling
them
from
requiring
more
of
them
than
they
could
give
me
she
answered
smothering
a
sigh
may
i
look
at
them
i
asked
anticipating
her
permission
by
rising
and
going
toward
them
yes
certainly
she
answered
rising
herself
and
following
me
languidly
the
books
were
arranged
in
groups
science
history
biography
travels
poetry
fiction
with
bound
volumes
of
such
periodicals
as
the
nineteenth
and
the
i
read
the
titles
of
the
volumes
in
the
science
divisions
with
surprise
for
she
had
never
betrayed
nor
had
i
ever
suspected
that
she
had
added
the
incident
of
learning
to
the
accident
of
brains
but
if
she
knew
the
contents
of
but
half
of
these
books
well
she
must
be
a
highly
educated
woman
i
took
out
several
to
see
how
they
had
been
read
and
found
them
all
carefully
annotated
with
marginal
notes
very
clearly
written
and
containing
apposite
quotations
from
and
references
to
the
best
authorities
on
the
various
subjects
this
was
especially
the
case
with
books
on
the
natural
sciences
the
physical
ones
having
apparently
interested
her
less
these
are
not
very
elegant
books
for
a
lady
boudoir
she
said
referring
to
the
plain
dark
bindings
i
dislike
gorgeously
bound
books
and
could
never
make
a
pet
of
one
they
are
like
people
all
one
care
is
concentrated
upon
their
appearance
and
their
real
worth
of
character
if
they
have
any
escapes
one
were
you
ever
an
omnivorous
reader
i
asked
no
i
am
thankful
to
say
she
answered
her
natural
aptitude
for
intellectual
pursuits
overcoming
her
artificial
objection
to
them
as
she
looked
at
her
books
and
became
interested
in
them
in
spite
of
herself
for
i
notice
that
the
average
reader
who
reads
much
remembers
little
and
is
absurdly
inaccurate
it
is
as
bad
to
read
everything
as
to
eat
everything
the
mind
when
it
is
gorged
with
a
surfeit
of
subjects
retains
none
of
them
she
had
a
fairly
representative
collection
of
french
italian
german
books
all
equally
and
annotated
each
in
its
own
language
the
french
and
italian
being
excellent
but
the
german
imperfect
although
as
she
told
me
she
liked
both
the
language
and
the
literature
very
much
the
best
of
the
three
german
suggested
ideas
to
me
she
said
and
that
is
why
i
paid
less
attention
to
the
construction
of
the
language
i
think
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
no
elegancies
in
any
tongue
i
use
for
language
has
always
been
to
me
a
vehicle
of
thought
and
not
a
part
of
art
to
be
employed
with
striking
effect
now
here
is
carlyle
the
arch
phrasemaker
i
always
admired
him
more
than
i
loved
him
but
his
books
are
excellent
for
intellectual
exercise
he
forced
those
phrases
from
his
brain
with
infinite
pains
and
when
you
take
them
collectively
you
find
yourself
obliged
to
force
them
into
yours
in
like
manner
she
had
become
all
interest
and
animation
by
this
time
and
i
had
never
known
her
so
delightful
as
she
was
that
morning
while
showing
me
her
books
she
had
no
objection
to
lending
me
any
that
i
chose
although
i
told
her
that
i
only
wanted
them
to
read
her
notes
i
took
a
variety
but
found
no
morbid
tendency
in
any
remark
she
had
made
upon
them
i
paid
my
visit
late
in
the
afternoon
next
day
and
found
evadne
in
the
drawing
room
she
was
standing
in
the
window
when
i
entered
but
came
down
the
room
to
greet
me
i
have
been
watching
for
you
she
said
i
hoped
you
would
come
early
and
i
have
also
been
watching
that
party
of
jubilant
ducks
waddling
down
the
road
come
and
see
them
i
believe
they
belong
to
us
they
must
have
escaped
from
the
yard
but
are
they
enjoying
the
ramble
that
old
drake
is
quite
puffed
up
with
excitement
and
importance
he
goes
along
nodding
his
head
and
saying
again
and
again
to
the
ducks
did
i
tell
you
so
and
are
you
glad
you
took
my
advice
and
came
and
all
the
ducks
are
smiling
and
complimenting
him
upon
his
wisdom
and
courage
they
ought
to
be
driven
back
but
i
have
the
heart
to
spoil
their
pleasure
just
yet
by
informing
against
them
i
was
standing
beside
her
in
the
window
now
and
she
looked
up
at
me
smiling
as
she
spoke
she
was
brighter
under
the
immediate
influence
even
of
the
watery
winter
sun
now
a
red
ball
glowing
behind
the
brown
branches
of
the
leafless
trees
than
she
had
been
in
her
gloomy
north
room
and
i
took
this
lively
interest
in
the
adventurous
ducks
to
be
a
glimpse
of
the
joyous
healthy
mind
seeing
character
in
all
things
animate
and
gifted
with
sympathy
as
well
as
insight
which
must
naturally
have
been
hers
when
am
i
to
go
out
she
asked
i
begin
to
long
for
a
sight
of
my
i
do
want
to
speak
to
them
i
only
want
to
see
them
but
i
am
sociable
to
that
extent
when
i
am
in
my
right
mind
tell
me
about
this
mental
malady
i
begged
ah
she
began
laughing
up
at
me
but
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
interest
you
now
i
am
a
case
you
do
not
flatter
me
but
i
mean
to
give
you
every
help
in
my
power
if
only
you
could
cure
me
she
clasped
her
hands
and
held
them
out
to
me
the
gesture
of
an
instant
but
full
of
earnest
entreaty
come
from
the
window
i
said
it
is
chilly
here
yes
come
to
the
fire
she
rejoined
leading
the
way
and
sit
down
and
let
us
have
tea
and
talk
and
be
cosey
you
want
me
to
talk
about
myself
and
i
will
if
i
can
i
was
happy
just
now
but
you
see
i
am
depressed
in
a
moment
it
is
misery
to
me
to
be
so
variable
and
i
constantly
feel
as
if
i
wanted
something
to
be
somewhere
or
to
have
something
i
do
know
where
or
what
it
is
a
sort
of
general
dissatisfaction
but
it
is
all
the
worse
for
not
being
positive
if
i
knew
what
i
wanted
i
should
be
cured
by
the
effort
to
obtain
it
she
rang
the
bell
and
began
to
make
up
the
fire
and
i
sat
down
and
watched
her
because
she
liked
to
do
those
things
in
her
own
house
strangers
wait
upon
me
she
said
but
my
friends
allow
me
to
wait
upon
them
when
the
servant
had
brought
tea
and
retired
she
began
again
now
question
me
she
said
and
make
me
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
sure
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
i
asserted
i
am
sure
i
shall
try
she
replied
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
shall
succeed
if
you
provoke
me
i
shall
fence
with
you
if
you
confuse
me
i
shall
unwittingly
say
when
i
mean
in
fact
i
am
surprised
to
find
myself
confiding
this
trouble
to
you
at
all
it
has
come
about
by
accident
but
i
am
very
glad
it
is
such
a
relief
to
speak
but
how
it
come
about
she
broke
off
did
you
suspect
suspect
what
that
i
am
insane
you
are
not
insane
i
answered
harshly
she
looked
at
me
as
if
my
words
or
manner
amused
her
i
remember
now
she
said
i
complained
of
the
worry
in
my
head
and
then
you
questioned
me
it
is
not
an
uncommon
complaint
i
rejoined
is
it
not
she
answered
well
i
do
know
whether
to
be
sorry
for
the
other
sufferers
or
relieved
to
think
that
i
am
not
the
only
one
which
is
what
you
intend
i
believe
but
doctor
the
misery
is
terrible
especially
now
that
it
has
become
almost
incessant
it
drives
me
fills
my
mind
with
such
dreadful
ideas
i
have
actually
meditated
murder
lately
murder
in
the
abstract
i
supposed
no
murder
actually
murder
for
my
own
benefit
or
what
i
fancy
in
that
mood
would
be
for
my
benefit
the
murder
of
one
poor
miserable
creature
whom
i
pity
with
all
my
heart
and
really
care
for
when
i
am
in
my
right
mind
my
heart
sank
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
know
and
i
had
no
inclination
to
ask
who
the
one
poor
miserable
creature
was
and
when
the
impulse
is
on
you
what
do
you
do
i
said
it
is
not
an
impulse
exactly
she
answered
at
least
it
is
nothing
which
i
have
ever
had
the
slightest
inclination
to
act
upon
i
am
just
possessed
by
the
idea
whatever
it
may
be
and
then
i
can
not
sit
still
i
have
to
rush
out
into
regent
street
for
example
i
suggested
her
last
remark
having
thrown
a
sudden
upon
that
occurrence
yes
she
said
but
i
did
know
i
was
going
to
regent
street
i
had
read
of
dickens
prowling
about
the
streets
of
london
late
at
night
when
he
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
overwork
and
recovering
his
tranquillity
and
power
in
that
way
and
i
thought
i
would
try
the
experiment
so
i
went
out
and
just
walked
on
until
i
was
tired
and
then
i
got
into
an
omnibus
so
as
to
be
with
the
people
and
when
it
stopped
and
they
all
got
out
i
got
out
too
and
walked
on
again
and
then
that
horrid
old
man
spoke
to
me
it
was
a
great
shock
but
it
had
the
happiest
effect
i
woke
up
as
it
were
the
moment
i
got
rid
of
him
and
felt
quite
myself
again
and
then
i
hurried
back
as
you
know
you
still
disapprove
well
in
one
way
perhaps
you
are
right
but
still
it
did
me
good
she
stopped
and
looked
into
the
fire
thoughtfully
and
then
she
smiled
forgive
me
do
she
said
i
know
i
behaved
badly
next
day
i
could
not
help
it
the
sudden
relief
to
my
mind
had
sent
my
spirits
up
inordinately
for
one
thing
and
then
your
face
your
consternation
was
really
comical
if
i
had
injured
you
irreparably
in
your
estimation
of
the
value
of
your
own
opinion
of
people
you
could
not
have
cared
more
but
i
am
sorry
very
very
sorry
she
added
with
feeling
that
you
should
have
lost
your
respect
for
me
what
could
make
you
think
that
i
had
lost
my
respect
for
you
i
asked
in
surprise
because
you
know
you
have
never
come
to
see
me
since
as
you
used
to
do
she
looked
at
me
a
moment
wistfully
and
i
knew
she
half
expected
me
to
explain
or
make
some
excuse
but
i
could
not
unfortunately
do
either
without
making
bad
worse
i
could
assure
her
however
honestly
that
i
had
not
lost
my
respect
for
her
and
i
came
to
see
you
when
you
required
me
i
added
but
she
was
not
satisfied
i
know
your
philanthropy
she
said
but
i
would
rather
have
you
come
as
of
old
because
you
believed
in
me
and
like
and
respect
me
i
value
your
friendship
and
it
pains
me
to
find
that
you
can
only
treat
me
now
like
any
other
suffering
sinner
is
it
going
to
be
so
always
will
the
child
kill
me
with
her
innocent
talk
she
had
not
alluded
to
the
discontinuance
of
my
visits
before
i
thought
she
had
not
missed
me
and
being
in
a
double
mood
had
been
somewhat
hurt
by
the
seeming
indifference
although
i
would
not
have
had
her
want
me
when
i
could
not
come
now
however
i
was
greatly
distressed
to
find
the
construction
she
had
put
upon
my
absence
and
all
the
more
so
because
i
could
not
explain
do
not
say
that
i
exclaimed
you
have
always
had
you
always
will
have
my
most
sincere
respect
it
is
part
of
an
unhealthy
state
of
mind
which
makes
you
doubt
the
attachment
of
your
friends
she
was
glad
to
accept
this
assertion
ah
yes
she
said
i
know
the
symptoms
but
i
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
thank
you
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
she
sighed
leaned
back
in
her
chair
folded
her
hands
on
her
lap
and
looked
at
me
if
only
as
a
doctor
she
added
slowly
you
have
some
mysterious
power
over
my
mind
all
great
doctors
have
the
power
i
mean
i
wonder
what
it
is
your
very
presence
restores
me
in
an
extraordinary
way
you
dispel
the
worry
in
my
head
without
a
word
by
just
being
here
however
bad
it
is
i
used
to
long
for
you
so
on
those
days
when
you
never
came
and
i
used
to
watch
for
you
and
be
disappointed
when
you
drove
past
but
then
i
always
said
will
come
and
that
was
something
to
look
forward
to
i
used
to
think
at
first
you
would
get
over
my
escapade
or
learn
to
take
another
view
of
it
but
then
when
you
never
came
i
gradually
lost
heart
and
hope
and
that
is
how
it
was
i
broke
down
i
think
this
guileless
confidence
affected
me
painfully
but
i
want
to
discover
the
secret
of
a
great
doctor
success
she
pursued
what
is
your
charm
there
is
something
mesmeric
about
you
i
think
something
inimical
to
disease
at
all
events
there
is
healing
in
your
touch
and
your
very
manners
make
an
impression
which
cures
knowledge
i
suppose
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
suggested
smiling
no
nothing
she
answered
emphatically
i
have
carried
out
directions
of
yours
successfully
which
had
been
previously
given
to
me
by
another
doctor
and
tried
by
me
without
effect
you
alter
the
attitude
of
mind
somehow
that
is
how
you
do
it
i
believe
well
i
hope
to
alter
the
present
attitude
of
your
mind
completely
i
answered
and
to
resume
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
you
feel
when
one
of
those
tormenting
thoughts
has
passed
do
you
suffer
remorse
for
having
entertained
it
only
an
occasional
pang
she
said
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
sorrow
or
suffer
for
thoughts
which
i
can
not
control
i
am
suffering
from
a
morbid
state
of
mind
and
it
is
my
duty
to
fight
against
the
impulses
which
it
engenders
but
my
responsibility
begins
and
ends
with
the
struggle
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
wiser
to
try
and
forget
that
such
ideas
ever
were
than
to
encourage
them
to
haunt
me
by
recollecting
them
even
for
purposes
of
penitential
remorse
and
when
it
is
not
a
criminal
impulse
that
affects
you
she
ejaculated
aghast
at
the
word
i
had
used
it
on
purpose
to
see
its
effect
upon
her
and
was
satisfied
the
moral
consciousness
was
still
intact
yes
i
persisted
but
when
it
is
not
an
impulse
of
that
kind
what
is
it
that
disturbs
your
mind
thoughts
of
the
suffering
the
awful
needless
suffering
that
there
is
in
the
world
the
perception
of
it
is
a
spur
which
goads
me
at
times
so
that
i
feel
as
if
i
could
do
almost
anything
to
lessen
the
sum
of
it
but
then
you
see
my
hands
are
tied
so
that
all
i
can
do
is
think
think
think
we
must
change
that
to
work
work
work
i
said
it
is
too
late
she
answered
despondently
body
and
mind
have
suffered
mind
and
body
all
that
is
not
wrong
in
me
is
weak
i
would
have
it
otherwise
yes
but
give
me
some
anodyne
to
relieve
the
pain
that
is
all
you
can
do
for
me
now
i
will
give
you
no
anodyne
either
actual
or
figurative
i
answered
rising
to
go
if
you
had
no
recuperative
force
left
in
you
there
would
be
less
energy
in
your
despair
it
rests
with
yourself
now
entirely
to
be
as
as
ever
again
if
you
like
i
never
could
remember
whether
i
said
to
her
that
day
or
just
walked
out
of
the
room
like
the
forgetful
boor
i
sometimes
am
with
the
words
on
my
lips

his
moral
responsibility
before
him
in
the
consideration
of
a
case
must
be
a
very
indifferent
practitioner
and
with
regard
to
evadne
i
felt
mine
to
such
an
extent
that
before
the
interview
was
over
i
had
decided
that
i
was
not
the
proper
person
to
treat
her
i
doubted
my
judgment
for
one
thing
which
showed
that
for
once
my
nerve
was
at
fault
and
i
had
other
reasons
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
i
therefore
determined
to
run
up
to
town
to
consult
sir
shadwell
rock
about
her
he
was
a
distinguished
colleague
and
personal
friend
of
mine
a
man
of
vast
experience
and
many
years
my
senior
and
i
knew
that
if
he
would
treat
her
she
could
not
be
in
better
hands
when
i
left
i
found
that
i
had
just
time
to
drive
to
morningquest
and
catch
the
last
train
to
town
it
was
a
four
journey
but
fortunately
there
was
a
train
in
the
early
morning
which
would
bring
me
back
in
time
for
my
own
work
i
knew
sir
shadwell
was
in
town
and
telegraphed
to
him
to
beg
him
to
see
me
that
night
at
eleven
if
he
possibly
could
and
on
arriving
i
found
him
at
home
very
much
at
home
indeed
in
a
smoking
jacket
and
slippers
over
a
big
fire
in
his
own
private
sanctum
enjoying
his
bachelor
ease
with
a
cigarette
and
the
last
shilling
shocker
i
apologised
for
my
untimely
visit
but
he
put
me
at
my
ease
at
once
by
cordially
assuring
me
that
i
had
done
him
a
favour
i
was
going
to
a
boring
big
dinner
this
evening
when
your
telegram
arrived
and
your
coming
in
this
way
suggested
something
sufficiently
important
to
detain
me
so
i
sent
an
excuse
and
have
had
a
wholesome
chop
and
eh
real
good
he
added
confidentially
tapping
the
novelette
extraordinary
production
this
really
most
entertaining
i
ca
guess
who
did
it
you
know
i
ca
indeed
but
my
dear
boy
to
what
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
what
can
i
do
for
you
first
of
all
give
me
a
wholesome
chop
if
you
have
another
in
the
house
for
i
famishing
oh
a
thousand
pardons
for
my
remissness
he
exclaimed
ringing
the
bell
vehemently
of
course
you
have
dined
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
something
very
important
i
suppose
a
most
interesting
case
mental
yes
a
lady
well
not
another
word
until
you
had
something
to
eat
suitable
surroundings
play
an
important
part
in
the
discussion
of
such
cases
and
suitable
times
and
seasons
also
just
before
dinner
one
is
sanguine
and
just
after
one
is
too
much
so
when
you
have
eaten
take
time
to
reflect
and
a
cigarette
if
you
are
a
smoker
he
had
been
holding
his
book
in
his
hand
all
the
time
but
now
he
pottered
to
a
with
an
old
man
stiffness
peeped
at
the
paragraph
he
had
been
reading
marked
his
place
with
a
paper
cutter
and
muttered
very
strange
for
if
she
did
steal
the
jewels
who
did
must
dip
though
spoils
it
he
put
the
book
down
and
returned
to
me
taking
off
his
spectacles
as
he
came
and
smoothing
his
thick
white
hair
now
do
say
a
word
if
you
read
it
he
cautioned
me
i
always
owe
everybody
a
grudge
who
tells
me
the
plot
of
a
story
i
interested
in
but
let
me
see
what
was
i
saying
oh
take
time
that
was
it
there
is
nothing
like
letting
yourself
settle
if
you
are
at
all
perplexed
when
the
memory
is
crowded
with
details
the
mind
becomes
muddy
and
you
must
let
it
clear
itself
that
is
the
secret
of
my
own
success
in
any
difficulty
i
have
always
waited
do
try
to
think
much
better
dismiss
the
matter
from
your
mind
altogether
make
yourself
comfortable
in
the
easiest
chair
in
the
room
get
a
rousing
book
the
subject
is
of
no
importance
so
long
as
it
interests
you
and
in
half
an
hour
if
the
physical
is
satisfactory
you
will
find
the
mental
tension
gradually
relax
your
ideas
begin
to
flow
your
judgment
becomes
clear
and
you
suddenly
see
for
yourself
in
a
way
that
astonishes
you
then
pray
oblige
me
by
resuming
your
seat
and
cigarette
i
answered
and
let
me
transfer
my
difficulty
to
you
while
the
moment
lasts
moment
when
you
have
dined
he
said
i
wo
hear
a
word
while
you
are
famishing
tell
me
how
you
are
yourself
and
what
you
are
doing
my
dear
boy
it
is
really
a
pleasure
to
see
you
why
are
you
married
now
really
do
you
expect
me
to
answer
such
an
important
question
as
that
with
my
mind
in
its
present
muddy
condition
i
retorted
upon
him
my
many
reasons
are
all
rioting
in
my
recollection
and
i
ca
see
one
clearly
the
old
gentleman
smiled
and
sat
patting
the
arms
of
his
chair
for
a
little
you
looking
fagged
he
remarked
presently
work
wo
hurt
you
but
beware
of
worry
my
dinner
was
brought
to
me
on
a
tray
at
this
instant
and
the
dear
old
man
got
up
to
see
that
it
was
properly
served
he
tried
the
champagne
himself
to
be
sure
it
was
right
and
gave
careful
directions
about
the
coffee
his
interest
in
everything
was
as
fresh
as
a
boy
and
nothing
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
kindness
was
ever
a
trouble
to
him
you
have
been
coming
out
strong
in
defence
of
morality
lately
i
remarked
when
i
had
dined
you
have
somewhat
startled
the
proprieties
startled
the
pruderies
you
mean
he
answered
bridling
the
proprieties
face
any
necessity
for
discussion
with
modest
discretion
however
painful
it
may
be
well
you
done
some
good
at
all
events
i
answered
i
did
not
tell
him
but
only
that
very
day
i
had
heard
it
said
that
his
was
a
name
which
all
women
should
reverence
for
what
he
had
done
for
some
of
them
well
he
said
the
clergy
have
had
a
long
innings
they
have
been
hard
at
it
for
the
last
eighteen
hundred
years
and
society
is
still
rotten
at
the
core
it
is
our
turn
now
but
come
draw
up
your
chair
to
the
fire
and
be
comfortable
well
yes
he
went
on
rubbing
his
hands
i
suppose
eventually
morality
will
be
taught
by
medical
men
and
when
it
is
much
misery
will
be
saved
to
the
suffering
sex
my
own
idea
is
that
a
woman
is
a
human
being
but
the
clerical
theory
is
that
she
is
a
dangerous
beast
to
be
kept
in
subjection
and
used
for
domestic
purposes
only
married
life
is
made
up
to
a
great
extent
of
the
most
heartless
abuse
of
a
love
and
unselfishness
submission
you
know
when
i
had
given
him
the
details
of
evadne
case
so
far
as
i
had
gone
into
it
he
asked
me
what
my
own
theory
was
i
feel
sure
it
is
the
old
story
of
these
cases
in
women
i
answered
the
natural
bent
has
been
thwarted
to
begin
with
yes
he
commented
that
is
a
fruitful
source
of
mischief
even
in
these
days
when
women
so
often
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
lord
himself
speaking
in
their
own
hearts
and
do
what
he
directs
in
spite
of
the
church
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
women
of
ability
warp
their
minds
and
the
rising
generation
suffers
but
how
has
the
natural
bent
been
thwarted
in
this
case
i
have
not
ascertained
i
said
she
is
a
woman
of
remarkable
general
intelligence
but
she
makes
no
use
of
it
and
she
does
not
seem
to
have
any
one
decided
talent
that
she
cares
to
cultivate
and
consequently
she
has
no
absorbing
interest
to
occupy
her
mind
no
purpose
for
which
to
live
and
make
the
most
of
her
abilities
she
attends
punctually
to
her
social
duties
but
they
do
not
suffice
and
she
has
of
necessity
many
spare
hours
of
every
day
on
her
hands
during
which
she
sits
and
sews
alone
i
suppose
a
woman
embroidery
answers
much
the
same
purpose
as
a
man
cigarette
it
quiets
her
nerves
and
helps
her
to
think
if
she
is
satisfied
and
happy
in
her
surroundings
her
reflections
will
probably
be
tranquil
and
healthy
but
if
her
outward
circumstances
are
not
congenial
she
will
banish
all
thoughts
of
them
in
her
hours
of
ease
and
her
mind
will
gradually
become
a
prey
to
vain
imaginings
pleasant
enough
to
begin
with
doubtless
but
likely
to
take
a
morbid
tone
at
any
time
if
her
health
suffers
this
has
been
the
case
with
evadne
with
sir
shadwell
interrupted
with
my
patient
i
stammered
i
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
her
spoken
of
by
her
christian
name
humph
the
old
gentleman
grunted
enigmatically
she
has
one
of
those
minds
which
should
be
occupied
by
a
succession
of
lively
events
all
helping
on
some
desirable
object
i
proceeded
the
mind
of
a
naturally
active
woman
well
he
answered
it
seems
to
be
another
instance
of
the
iniquitous
folly
of
allowing
the
one
sex
to
impose
galling
limitations
upon
the
other
it
is
not
an
uncommon
case
so
far
as
the
mental
symptoms
go
how
does
she
get
on
with
her
husband
does
she
contradict
him
no
never
i
answered
she
is
always
courteous
and
considerate
ah
now
i
thought
so
he
chuckled
a
happily
married
woman
contradicts
her
husband
flatly
whenever
she
thinks
proper
she
knows
she
is
safe
from
wrangling
and
bitterness
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
domestic
position
is
the
difficulty
here
you
do
seem
to
have
inquired
into
that
very
carefully
i
made
no
answer
and
he
looked
at
me
sharply
for
a
moment
then
asked
me
how
old
my
patient
was
i
told
him
he
repeated
and
you
are
intimate
with
both
her
and
her
husband
now
have
you
ever
had
any
reason
to
doubt
her
honesty
her
verbal
honesty
of
course
i
mean
quite
the
contrary
i
answered
i
have
always
found
her
almost
peculiarly
frank
a
woman
may
be
accurate
you
know
in
all
she
says
of
other
people
he
observed
but
that
is
no
proof
that
she
will
be
so
concerning
herself
i
know
was
my
reply
but
i
feel
quite
sure
of
this
lady
word
and
during
the
time
that
you
have
known
her
she
now
confesses
that
she
has
suffered
more
or
less
yes
she
mentioned
one
interval
during
which
she
said
a
new
interest
in
life
took
her
completely
out
of
herself
what
was
the
interest
i
did
not
ask
her
she
fell
in
love
i
suppose
and
you
happened
to
know
the
fact
i
neither
know
nor
suspected
such
a
thing
that
was
it
you
may
be
sure
sir
shadwell
decided
when
a
young
and
attractive
woman
who
speaks
to
her
husband
with
marked
courtesy
and
consideration
instead
of
treating
him
familiarly
talks
of
having
an
interest
in
life
which
takes
her
completely
out
of
herself
you
may
take
it
for
granted
almost
always
that
the
new
interest
is
love
it
is
more
likely
to
have
been
the
epidemic
i
rejoined
and
then
i
gave
him
an
account
of
that
episode
ah
well
perhaps
he
said
we
are
evidently
dealing
with
a
nature
full
of
surprises
he
pursed
up
his
mouth
and
eyed
me
attentively
my
dear
boy
he
said
at
last
i
think
i
see
your
difficulty
you
had
better
turn
this
case
over
to
me
altogether
thank
you
i
answered
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
have
suggested
then
send
the
lady
up
to
town
and
i
will
do
my
best
for
her
chapter
xv
sir
shadwell
rock
was
exactly
the
kind
of
man
evadne
had
had
in
her
mind
i
felt
sure
when
she
spoke
of
the
peculiar
influence
which
distinguished
men
of
my
profession
exercise
upon
their
patients
he
was
a
man
of
taking
manners
to
begin
with
sympathetic
cultivated
humane
and
i
need
hardly
add
scrupulously
conscientious
and
exact
i
could
confide
her
to
his
care
with
the
most
perfect
reliance
upon
his
kindness
as
well
as
upon
his
discretion
and
skill
if
she
would
consent
to
consult
him
at
all
but
that
was
a
little
difficulty
which
had
still
to
be
got
over
i
anticipated
some
opposition
because
i
felt
sure
she
had
not
realized
that
there
was
anything
threatening
to
be
serious
in
her
case
and
would
therefore
see
no
necessity
for
further
advice
this
made
the
arrangement
difficult
it
would
not
do
to
arouse
any
apprehension
about
her
own
state
of
mind
but
how
to
induce
her
to
go
to
london
to
consult
an
eminent
specialist
without
doing
so
was
the
question
had
lady
adeline
been
at
home
the
suggestion
would
have
come
best
from
her
but
in
her
absence
there
was
nobody
to
make
it
except
that
impossible
colonel
colquhoun
if
he
chose
to
order
evadne
to
consult
sir
shadwell
rock
i
knew
she
would
do
so
at
once
for
she
never
opposed
him
and
he
was
so
apt
to
be
unreasonable
and
capricious
that
she
would
probably
not
think
that
the
order
signified
much
but
the
further
question
was
would
he
give
it
after
i
had
finished
my
work
i
drove
to
the
depôt
to
see
the
men
were
on
parade
when
i
entered
the
barrack
square
they
were
drawn
up
in
line
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
colonel
colquhoun
himself
prancing
about
on
his
charger
and
not
in
the
most
amiable
mood
possible
i
imagined
from
the
way
he
was
blackguarding
the
men
he
sat
his
horse
well
and
was
a
fine
soldierlike
man
in
uniform
and
a
handsome
man
too
of
the
martial
order
when
his
bald
head
was
hidden
by
his
cocked
hat
and
his
blond
moustache
had
a
chance
the
sort
of
man
to
take
a
woman
fancy
if
not
the
kind
of
character
to
keep
her
regard
an
unhappy
old
mounted
major
had
got
into
trouble
just
as
i
came
up
his
palfrey
was
an
easy
ambler
but
he
was
the
sort
of
old
gentleman
who
would
not
have
been
safe
in
a
rocking
chair
with
his
sword
drawn
and
his
chief
complimenting
him
you
ride
like
a
damned
tailor
sir
colonel
colquhoun
was
thundering
at
him
just
as
i
drove
up
an
officer
in
undress
uniform
captain
bartlet
and
brigade
surgeon
james
who
was
in
mufti
were
standing
at
an
open
window
in
the
and
i
joined
them
there
and
looked
out
at
the
parade
i
do
know
how
you
fellows
stand
that
kind
of
thing
and
before
the
men
too
i
remarked
of
a
fresh
volley
of
abuse
from
colonel
colquhoun
oh
by
jove
we
got
to
stand
it
many
of
us
for
weighty
considerations
quite
apart
from
our
personal
dignity
captain
bartlet
rejoined
a
man
with
a
wife
and
five
children
depending
upon
him
will
swallow
a
lot
for
their
sake
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
answer
him
but
keeps
us
quiet
a
deuced
sight
oftener
than
discipline
by
the
way
however
he
added
cheerfully
all
are
not
so
bad
as
that
brute
out
there
nor
the
half
of
them
for
the
matter
of
that
but
still
it
a
wonder
what
you
stand
you
combatants
james
observed
shut
up
doctor
captain
bartlet
rejoined
do
presume
upon
your
superior
position
promotion
does
depend
upon
the
colonel
confidential
report
nor
your
peace
in
life
upon
his
fancy
for
you
you
can
disagree
with
him
in
your
own
line
but
we
ca
in
ours
is
colonel
colquhoun
often
so
i
asked
he
had
just
been
assuring
that
unfortunate
major
that
a
billet
in
the
commissariat
department
with
a
pound
of
beef
on
one
spur
and
a
loaf
of
bread
on
the
other
to
prevent
accidents
was
the
thing
for
him
more
or
less
was
the
answer
he
notorious
all
through
the
service
he
brought
his
own
regiment
up
to
a
high
state
of
efficiency
i
must
say
that
for
him
and
led
it
into
action
like
a
man
but
between
ourselves
i
expect
there
never
been
a
time
since
he
got
his
company
when
there
was
a
bullet
ready
for
him
you
remember
james
in
india
of
course
it
was
an
accident
the
doctor
nodded
the
men
call
him
bully
colquhoun
he
supplemented
but
surely
his
character
is
known
at
the
horse
guards
i
said
ah
you
see
he
a
smart
officer
captain
bartlet
rejoined
and
what
are
officers
for
to
knock
about
and
to
be
knocked
about
just
look
at
him
now
see
how
he
bucketing
those
men
about
he
was
a
militiaman
and
that
a
militiaman
all
over
a
man
who
been
through
sandhurst
has
carried
a
rifle
for
a
year
himself
and
he
knows
what
it
is
and
gives
his
men
their
stand
easy
but
a
militiaman
has
no
more
feeling
for
them
than
a
block
well
i
ca
see
why
you
seniors
do
remonstrate
i
rejoined
the
war
office
is
bound
to
support
you
if
you
show
good
cause
yes
and
cashier
you
too
for
very
little
if
you
make
yourself
obnoxious
by
giving
them
trouble
bartlet
replied
roylance
was
the
only
fellow
that
ever
really
stood
up
to
colquhoun
he
was
a
young
subaltern
that
had
just
joined
but
an
awful
devil
when
he
was
roused
and
he
swore
in
the
anteroom
that
if
the
colonel
ever
blackguarded
him
before
the
men
or
anywhere
else
or
presumed
upon
his
position
to
address
him
in
terms
which
one
gentleman
is
not
permitted
to
use
to
another
he
give
him
as
much
as
he
got
well
the
very
next
day
on
parade
roylance
got
the
men
into
a
muddle
colquhoun
a
good
soldier
you
know
and
nothing
riles
him
like
inefficiency
and
by
jove
he
was
down
on
the
lad
like
shot
he
poured
his
whole
vocabulary
on
him
and
then
for
want
of
a
worse
word
he
called
him
damned
dissipated
subaltern
well
roylance
just
stepped
back
so
as
to
make
himself
heard
and
shouted
coolly
that
comes
well
from
you
sir
considering
the
reason
for
the
singular
arrangement
of
your
own
with
which
he
handed
his
sword
to
the
adjutant
and
walked
off
to
his
quarters
you
should
have
seen
colquhoun
face
he
went
on
leave
immediately
afterward
and
of
course
the
matter
was
hushed
up
roylance
exchanged
he
lots
of
money
it
the
men
without
means
that
have
to
stand
that
kind
of
thing
my
voice
was
husky
and
i
could
scarcely
control
it
but
i
managed
to
ask
what
was
the
insinuation
what
about
roylance
just
a
lie
the
lad
life
was
as
clean
as
a
lady
i
meant
about
the
marriage
oh
do
you
know
colquhoun
himself
told
us
all
about
it
in
his
cups
one
night
just
as
they
were
starting
on
their
wedding
trip
she
got
a
letter
containing
certain
allegations
against
him
and
she
gave
him
the
slip
at
the
station
and
went
off
by
herself
to
make
inquiries
and
in
consequence
of
what
she
learnt
she
declined
to
live
with
him
at
all
at
first
but
he
has
a
great
horror
of
being
made
the
subject
of
gossip
you
know
and
her
people
were
also
anxious
to
save
scandal
and
so
between
them
they
managed
to
persuade
her
just
to
consent
to
live
in
the
house
he
having
given
his
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
not
to
molest
her
and
that
has
been
the
arrangement
ever
since
funny
is
it
stranger
than
fiction
you
know
and
that
kind
of
thing
yet
it
seems
to
answer
they
excellent
friends
the
parade
had
been
dismissed
by
this
time
but
i
had
changed
my
mind
and
did
not
wait
to
see
colonel
colquhoun
i
had
to
hurry
back
to
make
arrangements
with
regard
to
my
patients
in
the
hospital
and
then
i
returned
to
town
and
midnight
saw
me
closeted
once
more
with
sir
shadwell
rock
chapter
xvi
the
revolting
story
i
had
heard
in
the
barracks
haunted
me
i
had
thought
incessantly
of
my
poor
little
lady
taken
out
of
the
school
room
to
face
a
position
which
would
be
horrifying
even
in
idea
to
a
right
minded
woman
of
the
world
what
the
girl
mental
sufferings
must
have
been
only
a
girl
can
tell
and
ever
since
the
incubus
of
that
elderly
man
of
unclean
antecedents
all
that
had
been
incomprehensible
about
evadne
was
obvious
now
and
also
the
mistake
she
had
made
during
the
most
important
part
of
the
time
when
a
woman
is
ripe
for
her
best
experiences
when
she
should
be
laying
in
a
store
of
happy
memories
to
fall
back
upon
when
memory
becomes
her
principal
pleasure
in
life
evadne
had
lived
alone
shut
up
in
herself
her
large
intelligence
idle
or
misapplied
and
her
hungry
heart
seeking
such
satisfaction
as
it
could
find
in
pleasant
imaginings
as
she
went
about
punctually
performing
her
ineffectual
duties
or
sat
silently
sewing
she
had
been
to
all
outward
seeming
an
example
to
be
revered
of
graceful
wifehood
and
womanliness
but
when
one
came
to
know
what
her
inner
life
had
become
in
consequence
of
the
fatal
repression
of
the
best
powers
of
her
mind
it
was
evident
that
she
was
in
reality
a
miserable
type
of
a
woman
wasted
the
natural
bent
of
the
average
woman
is
devotion
to
home
and
husband
and
children
but
there
are
many
women
to
whom
domestic
duties
are
distasteful
and
these
are
now
making
life
tolerable
for
themselves
by
finding
more
congenial
spheres
of
action
there
are
many
women
however
above
the
average
who
are
quite
capable
of
acquitting
themselves
creditably
both
in
domestic
and
public
life
and
evadne
was
one
of
these
had
she
been
happily
married
she
would
undoubtedly
have
been
one
of
the
first
to
distinguish
herself
one
of
the
foremost
in
the
battle
which
women
are
waging
against
iniquity
of
every
kind
her
keen
insight
would
have
kept
her
sympathies
actively
alive
and
her
disinterestedness
would
have
made
her
careless
of
criticism
that
was
her
nature
but
nature
thwarted
ceases
to
be
beneficent
she
places
us
here
fully
equipped
for
the
part
she
has
designed
us
to
play
in
the
world
and
if
we
men
or
women
neglect
to
exercise
the
powers
she
has
bestowed
upon
us
the
consequences
are
serious
i
did
not
understand
at
the
time
what
evadne
meant
when
she
said
that
she
had
made
it
impossible
for
herself
to
act
i
thought
she
had
deliberately
shirked
her
duty
under
the
mistaken
idea
that
she
would
make
life
pleasanter
for
herself
by
doing
so
but
i
learnt
eventually
how
the
impulse
to
act
had
been
curbed
before
it
quickened
by
her
promise
to
colonel
colquhoun
which
had
in
effect
forced
her
into
the
disastrous
attitude
which
we
had
all
such
good
reason
to
deplore
it
seemed
cruel
that
all
the
most
beautiful
instincts
of
her
being
her
affection
her
unselfishness
even
her
modest
reserve
and
womanly
should
have
been
used
to
injure
her
but
that
is
exactly
what
had
happened
and
now
the
difficulty
was
how
to
help
her
how
to
rouse
her
from
the
unwholesome
form
of
which
had
brought
about
her
present
morbid
state
of
mind
i
was
sitting
up
late
the
night
after
my
second
visit
to
sir
shadwell
rock
considering
the
matter
sir
shadwell
advice
was
still
the
same
send
her
to
me
but
the
initial
difficulty
how
to
get
her
to
go
remained
how
to
draw
her
from
the
dreary
seclusion
of
her
in
the
woman
and
persuade
her
that
hours
of
ease
are
only
to
be
earned
in
action
i
thought
again
of
lady
adeline
and
sat
down
to
write
to
her
the
household
had
retired
and
the
night
was
oppressively
silent
i
felt
overcome
with
fatigue
but
was
painfully
wide
awake
as
happens
very
often
when
i
am
anxious
about
a
bad
case
but
this
was
the
third
night
since
i
had
been
in
bed
and
i
thought
now
i
would
go
when
i
had
finished
my
letter
to
lady
adeline
and
do
my
best
to
sleep
as
i
crossed
the
hall
which
was
in
darkness
save
for
the
candle
i
carried
in
my
hand
i
fancied
i
heard
an
unaccountable
sound
a
dull
thud
thud
coming
from
i
could
not
tell
whence
for
the
moment
the
senses
are
singularly
acute
in
certain
stages
of
fatigue
and
mine
were
all
alive
that
night
to
any
impression
my
hearing
especially
so
and
there
was
no
mistake
i
had
stopped
short
to
listen
and
impossible
as
i
knew
it
would
have
been
at
any
other
time
i
was
sure
that
i
could
distinctly
hear
a
horse
galloping
on
the
turf
of
the
common
more
than
a
mile
away
a
mounted
horse
with
a
rider
who
was
urging
him
to
his
utmost
speed
and
in
some
inexplicable
manner
i
also
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
horseman
was
a
messenger
sent
in
all
haste
for
me
mechanically
i
put
my
candle
down
and
opened
the
hall
door
it
was
a
bright
night
the
fresh
invigorating
frosty
air
seemed
to
clear
my
mental
vision
still
more
strongly
as
it
blew
in
upon
me
diavolo
in
mess
dress
his
cap
gone
his
fair
hair
blown
back
by
the
wind
breathless
with
excitement
and
speed
with
thought
suspended
but
dry
lips
uttering
incessantly
a
cry
for
help
galbraith
galbraith
galbraith
my
pulses
kept
time
to
the
thud
of
the
horse
hoofs
on
the
common
i
waited
i
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
i
was
wanted
but
i
did
not
ask
myself
by
whom
the
sound
only
ceased
for
a
perceptible
second
or
so
at
the
lodge
gates
were
they
open
had
he
cleared
them
what
a
jump
thud
he
must
be
on
the
drive
now
the
gravel
is
flying
across
the
lawn
diavolo
good
speed
indeed
scarcely
five
minutes
since
i
heard
him
first
till
he
stopped
at
the
steps
in
the
starlight
hoarsely
panting
galbraith
galbraith
i
am
here
my
boy
what
is
it
come
come
to
her
at
once
colonel
colquhoun
is
dead
the
mind
quickened
by
the
shock
of
a
startling
piece
of
intelligence
suddenly
sums
up
our
suspicions
for
us
sometimes
in
one
crisp
homely
phrase
this
is
what
mine
did
the
murder
is
out
i
thought
the
moment
diavolo
spoke
evadne
was
this
the
end
of
it
such
a
state
of
mind
as
hers
had
been
lately
might
continue
for
the
rest
of
her
life
to
her
torment
without
influencing
her
actions
but
on
the
other
hand
an
active
phase
might
supervene
at
any
moment
diavolo
had
dismounted
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
steps
utterly
exhausted
here
take
the
reins
he
said
and
mount
i
done
look
after
myself
do
waste
a
moment
i
needed
no
urging
i
have
actually
meditated
murder
lately
murder
murder
for
my
own
benefit
the
horrible
phrases
in
regular
succession
kept
time
to
the
rhythmical
ring
of
the
iron
shoes
on
the
frozen
ground
as
the
horse
returned
with
me
still
at
a
steady
gallop
to
i
had
recognized
the
animal
it
was
the
same
fine
charger
which
colonel
colquhoun
himself
had
been
riding
so
admirably
on
parade
the
last
time
i
saw
him
only
yesterday
morning
murder
actually
murder
for
my
own
benefit
no
no
stumble
hold
up
only
a
stone
shall
we
ever
be
there
suspense
murder
actually
no
it
shall
not
be
that
hope
is
the
word
i
want
beat
it
out
of
the
hardened
earth
hope
hope
hope
hope
nothing
nothing
but
hope
we
had
arrived
at
last
no
one
about
doors
open
lights
flaring
and
a
strange
silence
leaving
the
horse
to
do
as
he
liked
i
walked
straight
upstairs
and
on
the
first
landing
i
met
evadne
maid
i
hoped
it
was
you
sir
come
this
way
she
whispered
and
pushed
open
a
door
which
stood
already
ajar
gently
as
if
afraid
of
disturbing
some
sleeper
it
was
colonel
colquhoun
bedroom
large
and
luxurious
like
the
man
himself
he
was
stretched
upon
the
bed
in
evening
dress
his
gray
face
upward
one
glance
at
sufficed
but
almost
before
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
i
was
conscious
of
an
indescribable
sense
of
relief
there
were
four
persons
in
the
room
that
poor
old
begad
major
who
could
not
ride
and
captain
bartlet
both
hastily
summoned
from
the
depôt
evidently
and
still
in
mess
dress
james
in
ordinary
morning
costume
with
a
covert
coat
on
and
evadne
herself
in
a
black
evening
dress
open
at
the
throat
it
was
her
attitude
that
relieved
my
mind
the
moment
i
saw
her
she
was
seated
beside
the
bed
crying
heartily
and
healthily
the
three
gentlemen
stood
just
behind
her
gravely
concerned
silent
sympathetic
helpless
waiting
for
me
no
one
spoke
for
the
dead
reverence
i
stood
by
the
bed
looking
down
on
the
splendid
frame
prone
now
and
inert
and
again
i
thought
of
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
finely
mounted
and
exercising
his
authority
arrogantly
i
looked
into
the
blank
countenance
no
other
man
on
earth
had
ever
called
forth
curses
from
my
inmost
soul
such
as
i
had
uttered
to
my
shame
in
one
great
burst
of
rage
that
had
surprised
me
and
shaken
my
fortitude
the
night
before
as
i
journeyed
back
alone
without
the
slightest
prospect
that
i
could
see
of
saving
her
the
blank
face
decently
composed
his
right
hand
palm
upward
was
stretched
out
toward
me
as
if
he
were
offering
it
to
me
and
thankful
i
was
to
feel
that
i
could
clasp
it
honestly
i
had
not
a
word
or
look
on
my
conscience
for
which
i
deserved
a
reproach
from
the
dead
man
lying
there
i
took
his
hand
a
doctor
doing
a
perfunctory
duty
no
a
last
natural
rite
an
act
of
reconciliation
in
that
solemn
moment
still
holding
his
hand
and
gazing
down
into
his
face
i
rejoiced
to
feel
that
the
trouble
had
passed
from
my
soul
that
the
rage
and
bitterness
were
no
more
and
that
only
the
touching
thought
of
his
kindly
hospitality
and
perfect
confidence
in
my
own
integrity
a
confidence
impossible
in
a
man
who
has
not
himself
the
saying
grace
of
a
better
nature
would
remain
with
me
from
that
time
forth
forever
i
laid
my
hand
on
evadne
shoulder
and
she
looked
up
ah
have
you
come
she
cried
her
voice
broken
with
sobs
that
shook
her
is
it
really
true
can
nothing
be
done
oh
poor
poor
man
what
a
life
what
a
death
a
miserable
miserable
misspent
life
and
such
an
end
in
a
moment
without
a
word
of
warning
and
all
these
years
when
i
have
been
beside
him
silent
and
helpless
if
only
i
could
have
done
something
to
help
him
said
something
surely
surely
there
was
i
might
have
done
she
held
her
clasped
hands
out
toward
me
the
familiar
gesture
appealing
to
me
to
blame
her
thank
heaven
i
inwardly
ejaculated
this
is
as
it
should
be
in
the
presence
of
eternal
death
her
own
transient
sufferings
were
forgotten
and
healthy
human
pity
destroyed
any
sense
of
personal
injury
she
might
have
cherished
we
four
men
stood
awkwardly
patiently
by
for
several
minutes
listening
to
her
innocent
knowing
her
story
and
touched
beyond
expression
by
the
utter
absence
of
all
selfish
sentiment
in
any
word
she
said
when
she
was
quite
exhausted
i
drew
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
took
her
to
her
own
room
cardiac
syncope
was
the
cause
of
death
colonel
colquhoun
had
been
out
that
evening
and
had
through
some
mistake
of
the
coachman
missed
his
carriage
and
walked
home
in
a
towering
rage
the
exertion
and
excitement
acting
together
on
a
heart
already
affected
had
brought
on
the
attack
he
was
storming
violently
in
the
hall
with
his
face
flushed
crimson
so
the
servants
told
us
when
all
at
once
he
stopped
and
called
evadne
twice
as
if
in
alarm
and
colquhoun
ran
down
from
the
drawing
room
but
before
she
could
reach
him
he
fell
on
the
floor
and
never
spoke
again
chapter
xvii
much
of
my
time
during
the
next
few
months
was
devoted
i
to
the
consideration
of
evadne
affairs
her
father
made
no
sign
and
she
had
no
other
relation
in
a
position
to
come
forward
and
share
the
responsibility
but
happily
she
had
very
good
friends
i
had
noticed
that
diavolo
was
singularly
agitated
when
he
brought
the
terrible
news
that
night
to
fountain
towers
but
thought
little
of
it
as
i
knew
the
boy
to
be
emotional
the
shock
to
his
own
feelings
did
not
however
prevent
him
thinking
of
others
and
the
next
thing
i
heard
of
him
was
that
he
had
been
to
morningquest
and
waited
till
the
telegraph
office
opened
in
order
to
send
the
news
to
his
own
people
and
beg
them
to
return
at
once
if
they
could
on
evadne
account
and
this
they
did
in
the
kindest
manner
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
i
have
only
come
to
fetch
evadne
lady
adeline
said
when
she
arrived
i
am
going
to
take
her
away
at
once
from
this
dreadful
house
and
this
dreary
english
winter
to
a
land
of
sunshine
and
flowers
and
soft
airs
and
i
hope
to
bring
her
back
in
the
spring
herself
again
as
have
never
known
her
stayed
behind
at
considerable
personal
inconvenience
to
consult
with
me
about
business
colonel
colquhoun
had
died
intestate
and
also
in
debt
what
he
had
done
with
his
money
we
could
not
make
out
except
that
a
large
sum
had
been
sunk
in
an
annuity
which
of
course
died
with
him
but
one
thing
was
quite
evident
which
was
that
evadne
would
have
little
or
nothing
besides
her
pension
from
the
service
and
that
would
be
the
merest
pittance
for
one
always
accustomed
to
the
command
of
money
as
she
had
been
wished
to
impose
a
handsome
sum
on
her
yearly
by
fraud
and
deceit
out
of
his
own
ample
income
really
ladies
are
so
peculiar
about
money
matters
he
said
i
feel
quite
sure
she
would
not
accept
sixpence
from
me
if
i
were
to
offer
it
to
her
but
she
need
not
know
where
the
money
comes
from
it
can
be
paid
into
her
account
at
the
bank
you
see
regularly
and
she
will
take
it
for
granted
that
she
is
entitled
to
it
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
i
answered
with
some
heat
but
at
any
rate
the
plan
is
not
possible
now
my
dear
galbraith
mr
remonstrated
do
not
put
your
foot
down
in
that
way
i
am
the
older
man
and
i
may
also
say
without
offence
the
older
friend
and
i
am
married
and
lady
adeline
will
strongly
approve
of
what
i
propose
i
do
not
doubt
it
i
maintained
but
it
can
not
be
done
she
is
not
the
kind
of
person
to
marry
for
money
observed
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
who
mrs
colquhoun
i
asked
i
do
understand
you
oh
he
answered
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
thinking
such
a
consideration
would
weigh
with
her
in
the
choice
of
a
second
husband
i
stared
at
the
man
he
was
sitting
at
a
writing
table
in
my
library
with
the
papers
we
had
been
going
through
spread
out
before
him
and
i
was
standing
opposite
and
as
he
spoke
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
with
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
it
brought
the
tips
of
his
long
white
fingers
together
and
smiled
up
at
me
bland
as
a
child
innocent
of
all
offence
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
did
secretly
enjoy
the
effect
of
unexpected
remarks
without
in
the
least
appreciating
the
permanent
impression
he
might
be
making
but
i
do
know
some
of
these
apparently
haphazard
observations
of
his
were
pregnant
with
reflection
and
i
believe
if
his
voice
had
been
strong
and
determined
instead
of
precise
and
insinuating
if
he
had
brushed
his
hair
up
instead
of
parting
it
in
the
middle
and
plastering
it
down
smoothly
on
either
side
of
his
head
if
his
hands
had
been
hardened
by
exposure
and
use
instead
of
whitened
by
excessive
care
if
he
had
worn
tweed
instead
of
velvet
would
have
been
called
acute
and
dreaded
for
his
cynicism
but
looking
as
he
did
inoffensive
as
a
lady
luggage
he
was
allowed
to
pass
unsuspected
and
if
his
mind
were
an
infernal
machine
concealed
by
a
quilted
cover
the
world
would
have
to
have
seen
it
to
credit
the
fact
i
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
after
that
last
remark
and
walked
to
the
window
glumly
but
as
i
stood
with
my
back
to
him
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
he
was
making
faces
at
me
or
up
to
any
other
undignified
antics
by
way
of
relaxation
did
he
ever
wriggle
with
merriment
when
he
was
alone
i
turned
suddenly
at
the
thought
he
was
calmly
perusing
a
paper
through
his
with
an
expression
of
countenance
at
once
so
benign
silly
and
that
i
felt
i
should
like
to
have
apologised
for
the
suspicion
there
is
nothing
for
it
galbraith
he
said
that
i
can
see
she
must
either
be
or
have
an
income
provided
for
her
she
has
enough
to
go
on
with
for
the
present
i
answered
you
can
provide
the
money
yourself
if
you
would
rather
he
suggested
in
the
tone
of
one
who
gives
in
to
oblige
you
i
do
care
you
know
where
the
money
comes
from
so
long
as
the
source
is
disinterested
and
respectable
i
had
returned
to
the
table
but
now
again
i
walked
to
the
window
but
i
think
he
continued
while
i
stood
with
my
back
to
him
as
you
say
for
the
present
nothing
need
be
done
give
her
time
for
a
rope
eh
what
i
do
deprecate
is
leaving
her
to
be
driven
by
poverty
to
marry
for
money
my
dear
galbraith
he
broke
off
protesting
you
have
been
on
the
prance
for
the
last
for
a
medical
man
you
have
less
repose
of
manner
than
is
essential
i
should
say
in
fact
you
quite
give
me
the
notion
that
you
are
impatient
but
perhaps
i
am
detaining
you
oh
not
at
all
i
assured
him
well
as
i
was
saying
he
pursued
give
her
time
to
marry
again
that
would
be
the
most
satisfactory
settlement
of
her
difficulties
she
is
i
quite
agree
with
you
a
very
attractive
person
now
there
is
the
duke
of
panama
already
lady
adeline
says
but
she
seems
to
have
an
objection
to
princes
especially
if
they
are
at
all
obese
i
do
not
like
obese
people
myself
now
do
ever
feel
nervous
on
that
score
what
score
the
score
of
obesity
you
are
just
nicely
proportioned
at
present
for
a
man
of
your
age
and
height
of
course
am
far
too
slender
but
if
you
were
to
get
any
stouter
by
and
by
it
would
be
such
a
dreadful
thing
i
hope
flesh
is
not
in
your
family
on
both
sides
on
one
i
know
it
is
now
my
people
are
all
slender
there
is
a
great
deal
in
that
i
notice
he
was
doing
up
the
documents
now
with
much
neatness
and
dexterity
these
had
better
go
to
my
lawyer
he
remarked
why
not
to
mine
i
suggested
oh
allow
me
he
said
with
great
suavity
as
the
older
man
of
course
as
a
question
of
right
we
neither
of
us
have
any
claim
to
the
privilege
of
being
allowed
to
help
this
lady
eventually
however
one
of
us
may
secure
the
right
but
there
is
many
a
slip
you
know
and
perhaps
it
would
be
less
awkward
afterward
if
a
person
whose
disinterestedness
is
quite
above
suspicion
had
had
the
direction
of
affairs
from
the
first
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
what
he
meant
by
this
time
and
the
argument
was
unanswerable
do
you
feel
inclined
to
return
with
me
to
mentone
he
asked
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
get
away
just
now
ah
i
suppose
it
too
soon
well
she
is
quite
safe
with
us
and
we
will
bring
her
back
to
hamilton
house
in
the
smiled
complacently
as
he
took
his
seat
in
his
carriage
i
almost
expected
him
to
thank
me
for
the
sport
i
had
been
giving
him
he
looked
so
like
a
man
who
had
been
enjoying
himself
thoroughly
i
thought
about
that
last
remark
of
his
after
he
had
gone
and
pitied
lady
adeline
it
must
be
trying
to
be
liable
at
any
moment
to
have
words
which
one
deliberately
chooses
to
hide
one
thoughts
set
aside
as
of
no
consequence
and
the
thoughts
themselves
answered
naďvely
however
there
was
no
real
reason
for
hiding
my
thoughts
any
longer
on
that
subject
i
had
done
my
best
manfully
i
hope
while
the
necessity
lasted
to
mask
my
feeling
for
her
even
from
myself
but
there
was
now
no
further
need
for
i
might
live
for
her
and
love
her
honestly
and
openly
at
last
and
accordingly
when
sir
shadwell
rock
came
to
me
for
a
few
days
at
christmas
i
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
my
intention
from
him
it
is
a
great
risk
he
said
gravely
a
very
great
risk
of
course
now
that
the
first
cause
of
all
the
trouble
is
removed
the
mental
health
may
be
thoroughly
restored
so
long
as
there
is
no
organic
brain
lesion
there
is
hope
in
all
such
cases
but
i
tell
you
frankly
that
the
first
call
upon
her
physical
strength
may
set
up
a
recurrence
of
the
moral
malady
and
you
can
not
foresee
the
consequences
however
you
know
as
much
about
that
as
i
do
and
i
can
see
it
no
use
warning
you
you
have
made
up
your
mind
yes
i
answered
i
shall
be
able
to
take
good
care
of
her
if
only
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
win
her
well
well
she
seems
to
be
a
loyal
little
body
the
old
gentleman
replied
and
i
wish
you
success
with
all
my
heart
she
will
have
much
in
her
favour
as
your
wife
and
since
you
are
determined
to
run
the
risk
let
us
hope
for
the
best
and
that
was
just
what
i
did
while
i
waited
for
the
spring
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
i
became
as
a
schoolboy
i
watched
the
birds
building
i
noticed
the
first
faint
green
shadow
on
the
hedges
and
the
yellowing
of
the
gorse
i
listened
in
the
freshness
of
the
dawn
to
the
thrush
that
sang
evadne
and
when
at
last
walked
in
one
day
unexpectedly
and
explained
somewhat
superfluously
that
he
had
come
i
could
have
thrown
up
my
hat
and
cheered
but
without
the
ladies
he
added
have
you
left
them
behind
you
i
demanded
trying
not
to
look
blank
yes
he
answered
very
slowly
then
added
at
hamilton
house
i
suppose
nobody
ever
thought
of
kicking
anything
so
slender
as
mr
or
associated
such
a
vulgar
idea
as
would
have
been
involved
in
the
suspicion
of
a
deliberate
intention
to
sell
you
with
a
person
of
such
courteous
and
distinguished
manners
but
one
did
occasionally
wonder
what
he
was
like
at
school
and
if
blessings
and
abuse
were
often
showered
on
him
then
at
one
and
the
same
time
as
had
come
to
be
the
case
in
later
life
he
had
come
to
ask
me
to
dinner
that
evening
and
when
i
arrived
he
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
gracefully
with
a
fan
in
his
hand
evadne
greeted
me
quietly
lady
adeline
with
affectionate
cordiality
and
diavolo
who
was
the
only
other
member
of
the
party
with
a
grave
yet
bright
demeanour
which
made
him
more
like
his
uncle
dawne
in
miniature
than
ever
the
spring
observed
precisely
waving
his
fan
to
emphasise
each
word
and
addressing
a
remote
angle
of
the
cornice
the
spring
a
young
man
fancy
lightly
turns
to
thoughts
of
love
diavolo
flushed
crimson
lady
adeline
looked
annoyed
but
evadne
sat
pale
and
still
as
if
she
had
not
heard
i
was
right
about
her
not
being
likely
to
leave
her
affairs
in
hands
very
soon
after
her
arrival
she
insisted
upon
having
an
accurate
statement
of
accounts
and
begged
me
to
go
over
to
hamilton
house
one
morning
to
render
it
as
she
found
quite
unapproachable
on
the
subject
she
received
me
in
the
morning
room
alone
and
began
at
once
in
the
most
way
reticence
convinces
me
that
i
am
a
beggar
she
said
cheerfully
tell
me
the
exact
sum
i
have
to
depend
upon
i
named
it
oh
then
she
proceeded
the
question
is
what
shall
i
do
i
can
not
possibly
live
in
the
world
you
know
on
such
a
sum
as
that
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
asked
her
tone
having
suggested
some
definite
plan
already
formed
go
into
a
sisterhood
i
think
she
answered
nonsense
i
exclaimed
she
raised
her
eyebrows
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
but
you
are
not
fit
for
such
a
life
why
in
a
month
you
would
be
seeing
visions
and
dreaming
dreams
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
do
that
now
in
any
case
wherever
i
am
she
sighed
and
then
she
added
smiling
at
her
own
cynicism
and
i
think
i
had
better
go
where
such
things
can
be
turned
to
good
account
i
have
had
no
horrid
thoughts
by
the
way
since
i
left
but
of
course
i
shall
relapse
no
you
will
not
i
blurted
out
if
you
marry
happily
her
face
flushed
all
over
at
the
word
will
you
evadne
i
proceeded
or
rather
could
you
be
happy
with
me
she
rose
and
made
me
a
deep
courtesy
thank
you
she
answered
scornfully
for
your
kind
consideration
sir
george
galbraith
i
always
thought
you
the
most
disinterested
person
i
ever
knew
but
i
had
no
idea
that
even
you
could
go
so
far
as
that
and
then
she
left
me
alone
with
my
consternation
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
perplexing
had
i
offended
her
lady
adeline
came
in
at
that
moment
and
i
put
the
question
to
her
telling
her
exactly
what
i
had
said
she
burst
out
laughing
my
dear
george
she
exclaimed
forgive
me
i
ca
help
it
but
you
think
yourself
you
were
a
little
bit
abrupt
you
do
not
seem
to
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
you
feel
any
special
affection
for
evadne
it
did
not
occur
to
you
to
protest
that
you
loved
her
for
instance
no
it
did
not
i
answered
i
should
think
that
the
fact
is
patent
enough
without
protestations
she
may
have
overlooked
it
all
the
same
lady
adeline
suggested
still
laughing
at
me
i
would
advise
you
to
find
out
the
next
time
you
have
a
chance
where
is
she
i
demanded
going
toward
the
door
oh
you
wo
see
her
again
you
may
be
sure
she
rejoined
and
it
is
just
as
well
you
bear
if
you
mean
to
make
love
to
her
with
that
kind
of
countenance
but
i
would
not
be
advised
i
strode
straight
up
to
her
room
which
i
happened
to
know
and
knocked
at
the
door
she
answered
come
in
evidently
not
expecting
me
and
when
she
saw
who
it
was
she
was
furious
i
can
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
such
conduct
she
exclaimed
well
then
i
make
you
understand
i
retorted
insinuated
afterward
that
evadne
only
accepted
me
to
save
her
life
but
i
protested
against
the
libel
i
have
never
to
my
certain
knowledge
uttered
a
rough
word
either
to
or
before
my
little
lady
in
the
whole
course
of
our
acquaintance
but
why
when
she
loved
me
she
should
have
gone
off
in
that
ridiculous
tantrum
simply
because
i
did
not
begin
by
expressing
my
love
for
her
i
shall
never
be
able
to
understand
she
might
have
been
sure
that
i
should
have
enough
to
say
on
that
subject
as
soon
as
i
was
accepted
the
day
after
the
engagement
was
announced
diavolo
called
upon
me
needless
to
say
he
found
me
in
the
seventh
heaven
i
had
been
walking
about
the
house
unable
to
settle
to
anything
and
when
i
heard
he
had
come
i
thought
it
was
to
congratulate
me
and
i
hurried
down
but
the
first
glimpse
of
his
face
caused
my
heart
to
contract
ominously
well
you
have
played
me
a
nice
trick
he
said
with
concentrated
bitterness
both
of
you
you
knew
what
intentions
were
and
you
gave
me
no
hint
of
your
own
you
preferred
to
steal
a
march
on
me
i
could
not
have
imagined
such
a
thing
possible
from
you
i
should
have
supposed
that
you
would
have
thought
such
underhand
conduct
low
diavolo
i
gasped
are
you
in
earnest
am
i
in
earnest
he
ejaculated
look
at
me
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
incapable
of
deep
feeling
if
only
i
had
known
i
exclaimed
yet
how
could
i
guess
the
difference
of
age
and
diavolo
my
dear
boy
believe
me
i
do
sympathise
with
you
most
sincerely
this
is
a
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
for
me
but
but
even
if
i
had
known
will
it
make
it
worse
for
you
if
i
say
it
it
is
me
she
loves
she
would
not
have
accepted
anyone
but
me
even
if
i
withdrawn
in
your
favour
he
waved
his
hand
to
stop
me
do
distress
yourself
he
said
it
is
fate
we
are
to
be
punished
with
extinction
as
a
family
for
the
sins
of
our
forefathers
my
case
will
be
the
same
as
uncle
dawne
only
he
added
suddenly
and
clenched
his
fists
only
if
you
treat
her
badly
i
blow
your
brains
out
i
hope
you
will
i
answered
he
looked
hard
at
me
with
a
pained
expression
in
his
eyes
ah
i
a
fool
he
said
forgive
me
i
do
know
what
i
saying
i
mad
with
disappointment
and
grief
and
rage
of
course
if
she
loves
you
i
never
had
a
chance
yet
the
possibility
of
giving
me
one
had
you
known
occurred
to
you
well
i
will
show
you
that
i
can
be
as
generous
as
you
are
he
held
out
his
hand
i
i
congratulate
you
he
faltered
only
make
her
happy
but
i
know
you
will
he
felt
about
for
his
hat
and
having
found
it
walked
with
an
uncertain
step
toward
the
door
blinded
with
tears
i
stood
long
as
he
had
left
me
ah
brother
have
you
not
full
oft
found
even
as
the
roman
did
that
in
life
most
delicious
draught
amari
aliquid
lady
adeline
met
me
sadly
the
next
time
i
went
to
hamilton
house
do
you
blame
me
i
faltered
no
oh
no
she
generously
responded
none
of
us
not
one
of
us
not
even
angelica
suspected
for
a
moment
that
he
was
in
earnest
it
had
been
his
you
know
all
his
life
evadne
herself
has
no
inkling
of
the
truth
i
hope
she
never
will
i
said
if
it
rests
with
diavolo
she
will
not
his
mother
answered
proud
of
him
and
with
good
cause
it
is
a
salient
feature
of
the
morningquest
family
history
that
not
one
of
them
ever
had
a
great
grief
which
they
did
not
make
in
the
long
run
a
source
of
joy
to
other
people
diavolo
first
impulse
was
to
go
and
see
service
abroad
but
he
soon
abandoned
that
idea
although
it
would
have
afforded
him
the
distraction
he
so
sorely
needed
and
resigned
his
commission
instead
and
then
took
up
his
abode
at
morne
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
his
grandfather
entirely
and
it
was
in
companionship
that
the
latter
found
the
one
great
pleasure
and
solace
of
his
declining
years
the
old
duke
had
been
wont
to
say
of
diavolo
at
his
worst
that
lad
is
a
gentleman
at
heart
and
mark
my
words
he
will
prove
himself
so
yet
and
so
he
has
his
was
the
first
and
loveliest
present
evadne
received
he
did
not
come
to
her
second
wedding
but
then
nobody
else
did
except
his
father
and
mother
for
it
pleased
us
all
to
keep
the
ceremony
as
quiet
and
private
as
possible
so
that
his
absence
was
not
significant
and
afterward
he
rather
made
a
point
if
anything
of
not
avoiding
us
in
any
way
in
fact
the
only
change
i
noticed
in
him
was
that
he
never
again
made
any
of
those
laughing
protestations
of
love
and
devotion
to
evadne
with
which
he
used
to
amuse
us
all
in
the
dark
days
of
her
captivity
chapter
xviii
we
were
married
in
london
and
when
the
final
arrangements
were
being
discussed
i
asked
her
where
she
would
like
to
go
after
the
ceremony
oh
let
us
go
home
don
she
said
she
insisted
on
calling
me
don
i
told
her
the
name
conveyed
no
idea
to
me
but
she
answered
that
i
was
obtuse
and
she
was
sure
i
should
grow
to
love
it
in
time
even
if
i
did
not
understand
it
if
it
were
only
because
it
was
and
nobody
could
use
it
but
herself
to
which
extent
by
the
way
i
was
very
soon
able
to
endorse
her
opinion
do
let
us
go
to
nasty
foreign
hotels
i
hate
travelling
and
i
hate
the
kind
of
one
does
for
the
sake
of
seeing
we
will
go
home
and
be
happy
no
place
could
be
half
so
beautiful
to
me
as
yours
is
now
that
she
should
call
it
home
at
once
and
long
to
be
settled
there
was
a
good
omen
i
thought
but
she
was
happy
beyond
all
possibility
of
a
doubt
in
the
anticipation
of
her
life
with
me
soon
after
our
return
i
took
her
into
morningquest
and
left
her
to
lunch
with
her
aunt
orton
beg
i
had
business
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
which
detained
me
for
some
hours
and
when
at
last
i
could
get
away
i
hurried
back
being
naturally
impatient
to
rejoin
her
mrs
orton
beg
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room
and
i
suppose
something
in
the
expression
of
my
face
amused
her
for
she
laughed
and
answered
a
question
i
had
not
asked
out
there
she
said
meaning
in
the
garden
i
turned
and
looked
through
the
open
french
window
and
instantly
that
haunting
ghost
of
an
indefinite
recollection
was
laid
evadne
was
sleeping
in
a
chair
with
the
old
brick
wall
for
a
background
and
half
her
face
concealed
by
a
large
summer
hat
which
she
held
in
her
hand
i
thought
you
would
remember
when
you
saw
her
so
said
orton
beg
it
was
just
after
that
unhappy
marriage
fiasco
she
had
run
away
and
sought
an
asylum
here
and
when
you
were
so
struck
by
her
appearance
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
you
had
not
met
before
it
was
too
late
and
then
you
asked
me
to
use
the
scottish
gift
of
second
sight
i
was
thinking
at
the
moment
that
she
was
the
kind
of
girlie
i
should
choose
for
a
wife
and
so
i
said
she
should
marry
a
man
called
george
which
made
it
doubly
a
delphic
oracle
for
vagueness
to
me
said
orton
beg
because
colonel
colquhoun
name
was
also
george
now
this
is
a
singular
coincidence
i
exclaimed
ah
she
ejaculated
but
i
do
not
talk
of
there
is
a
special
providence
you
know
which
deserts
edith
and
protects
evadne
you
are
incorrigible
you
are
a
demon
worshipper
the
infinite
good
gives
us
the
knowledge
and
power
if
we
will
use
it
was
a
seventh
wave
seventh
waves
of
humanity
must
suffer
you
said
we
looked
at
each
other
the
oracle
was
ominous
but
surely
she
has
suffered
enough
heaven
grant
her
happiness
at
last
amen
i
answered
fervently
as
soon
as
we
were
settled
i
tried
to
order
her
life
so
as
to
take
her
mind
completely
out
of
the
old
groove
i
kept
her
constantly
out
of
doors
and
never
let
her
sit
and
sew
alone
for
one
thing
or
lounge
in
easy
chairs
or
do
anything
else
that
is
enervating
i
made
her
ride
too
and
rise
regularly
in
the
morning
not
too
early
for
that
is
as
injurious
in
one
way
as
too
late
is
in
another
the
latter
enervates
but
the
former
exhausts
regularity
is
the
best
discipline
i
taught
her
also
to
shoot
at
a
mark
and
took
her
into
the
coverts
in
the
autumn
but
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
suffering
creatures
and
unfortunately
she
wounded
a
bird
the
first
time
we
were
out
and
i
was
never
able
to
persuade
her
to
shoot
at
another
however
there
was
active
exercise
enough
for
her
without
that
so
long
as
she
was
able
to
take
it
and
when
it
became
necessary
to
curtail
the
amount
she
drove
both
morning
and
afternoon
and
took
short
walks
and
pottered
about
the
grounds
in
between
times
i
had
bought
while
she
was
abroad
with
the
and
had
had
the
whole
place
pulled
down
and
the
site
converted
into
a
plantation
so
that
no
trace
was
left
of
that
episode
to
vex
her
in
fact
i
had
done
all
that
i
could
think
of
as
likely
in
any
way
to
help
to
her
health
and
certainly
she
was
very
happy
everything
i
wished
her
to
do
seemed
to
be
a
pleasure
to
her
and
mind
and
body
grew
rapidly
so
vigorous
that
i
lost
all
fear
for
her
she
said
she
was
a
new
creature
and
she
looked
it
when
we
had
been
married
about
a
year
sir
shadwell
rock
came
to
pay
us
a
visit
evadne
was
quite
at
her
best
then
and
i
introduced
her
to
him
triumphantly
he
asked
about
her
progress
with
kindly
interest
when
we
were
alone
together
and
declared
heartily
that
she
was
certainly
to
all
appearance
thoroughly
restored
that
he
was
quite
in
love
with
her
himself
and
hoped
to
see
her
in
the
van
of
the
new
movement
yet
she
took
to
the
dear
old
man
and
told
him
his
great
reputation
did
not
frighten
her
one
bit
and
she
would
lean
on
his
arm
familiarly
out
in
the
grounds
pelt
him
with
gorse
blossom
fill
his
pockets
with
rose
leaves
surreptitiously
till
they
bulged
out
like
bags
behind
and
keep
him
smiling
perpetually
at
her
pretty
ways
he
had
been
going
abroad
for
a
holiday
but
we
persuaded
him
to
stay
with
us
instead
and
when
we
parted
with
him
at
last
reluctantly
he
declared
that
evadne
had
made
him
young
again
and
the
wrinkles
were
all
smoothed
out
his
last
words
to
me
were
so
far
so
good
galbraith
and
i
knew
he
meant
to
warn
as
well
as
to
congratulate
do
keep
her
in
cotton
wool
too
much
make
her
face
sickness
and
suffering
while
she
is
well
herself
take
warning
by
the
epidemic
she
has
no
morbid
horror
of
that
subject
because
she
knows
practically
how
much
can
be
done
for
the
sufferers
if
she
devote
herself
to
good
works
she
will
be
sanguine
because
so
much
is
being
accomplished
instead
of
dwelling
despondently
on
the
hopeless
amount
there
is
still
to
do
soon
after
this
however
i
began
to
hope
that
a
new
interest
in
life
was
coming
to
cure
her
of
all
morbid
moods
for
ever
i
was
anxious
at
first
but
she
was
so
quietly
happy
in
the
prospect
herself
and
she
continued
so
well
in
spite
of
the
drain
upon
her
strength
that
i
soon
took
heart
again
you
have
got
to
be
very
young
don
since
i
was
so
good
as
to
marry
you
she
said
to
me
one
day
she
had
come
in
with
some
flowers
for
me
and
had
caught
me
whistling
instead
of
working
sir
shadwell
had
consented
in
his
usual
kind
and
generous
way
to
share
the
responsibility
of
this
time
with
me
he
came
down
to
us
for
an
occasional
just
to
see
how
she
progressed
and
his
observations
like
my
own
continued
to
be
satisfactory
it
was
a
crucial
test
we
knew
if
we
could
carry
her
safely
through
this
trying
time
she
would
be
able
to
take
her
proper
place
with
the
best
of
her
sex
in
the
battle
of
life
to
fight
with
them
and
for
them
which
was
what
we
both
ardently
desired
to
see
her
do
there
had
been
never
a
word
of
the
mental
malady
since
colquhoun
death
i
had
judged
it
well
to
let
her
forget
she
had
ever
suffered
so
if
she
could
and
i
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
she
ever
thought
of
it
she
had
had
hours
and
even
days
of
depression
since
our
marriage
but
had
always
been
able
to
account
for
them
satisfactorily
and
now
although
of
course
she
got
down
at
times
she
was
less
often
so
than
is
usually
the
case
under
the
circumstances
and
was
always
easily
consoled
she
paid
me
a
visit
in
my
study
one
day
she
had
a
habit
of
coming
occasionally
when
i
was
at
work
a
habit
that
happily
emphasized
the
difference
between
my
solitary
bachelor
days
and
these
she
was
shy
of
her
caresses
as
a
rule
but
would
occasionally
make
my
knee
her
seat
if
it
happened
to
suit
her
convenience
while
she
filled
the
flower
vases
on
my
table
or
she
would
stand
behind
me
with
her
hands
clasped
round
my
neck
and
lean
her
cheek
against
my
hair
she
did
so
now
you
love
your
work
don
do
you
she
said
yes
sweetheart
i
answered
next
to
you
it
is
the
great
delight
of
my
life
but
don
you
find
it
do
you
no
not
but
sufficiently
so
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
if
you
ever
had
any
great
grief
after
the
first
shock
you
would
return
to
your
old
pursuits
would
you
not
and
by
and
by
you
would
find
solace
in
them
i
unclasped
her
hands
from
my
neck
and
drew
her
round
to
me
there
was
a
new
note
in
her
voice
that
sounded
ominous
what
is
the
trouble
little
woman
i
whispered
when
i
had
her
safe
in
my
arms
i
do
think
i
could
die
and
leave
you
don
if
i
thought
you
would
be
miserable
well
then
do
allow
yourself
to
entertain
any
doubt
on
the
subject
i
answered
for
i
should
be
more
than
i
should
never
care
for
anything
in
the
world
again
but
if
i
should
have
to
die
there
is
no
need
to
distress
either
yourself
or
me
by
such
an
idle
supposition
evadne
i
answered
there
is
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
alarm
i
am
not
she
said
and
then
she
was
silent
a
few
days
later
i
found
her
sitting
on
the
floor
in
the
library
reading
a
book
she
had
taken
from
one
of
the
lower
shelves
it
was
a
book
of
sir
shadwell
rock
on
the
heredity
of
vice
i
took
it
from
her
gently
remarking
as
i
did
so
i
would
rather
you
did
not
read
these
things
just
now
evadne
i
suppose
you
agree
with
sir
shadwell
rock
she
said
let
me
help
you
up
i
answered
do
you
she
persisted
of
course
he
is
our
chief
authority
i
answered
but
promise
me
evadne
not
to
look
at
any
of
those
books
again
without
consulting
me
i
shall
be
having
you
like
the
medical
students
who
imagine
they
have
symptoms
of
every
disease
they
study
it
would
mark
a
strange
change
in
my
mind
she
answered
for
i
used
to
be
able
to
study
any
subject
of
the
kind
without
being
affected
in
that
way
that
her
mind
had
changed
alas
or
rather
that
it
had
been
injured
by
friction
and
pressure
of
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
it
was
the
suspicion
which
necessitated
my
present
precaution
but
i
could
not
say
so
she
held
out
her
hands
for
me
to
help
her
to
rise
why
are
women
kept
in
the
dark
about
these
things
she
said
pointing
to
the
books
on
heredity
why
are
we
never
taught
as
you
are
we
are
the
people
to
be
informed
you
are
quite
right
i
said
it
is
criminal
to
vithhold
knowledge
from
any
woman
who
has
the
capacity
to
acquire
it
but
there
is
a
time
for
everything
you
know
my
sweetheart
now
that
poor
colonel
colquhoun
she
went
on
as
if
i
had
not
spoken
he
for
one
should
never
have
been
born
with
his
ancestry
he
must
have
come
into
the
world
foredoomed
to
a
life
of
dissipation
and
disease
it
is
awful
to
think
we
may
any
of
us
become
the
parents
of
people
who
ca
be
moral
without
upsetting
the
whole
natural
order
of
the
universe
o
don
it
is
dreadful
to
know
it
but
it
is
sinful
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
but
there
is
no
fear
for
our
children
evadne
i
said
ah
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
round
my
arm
come
out
into
the
grounds
then
sweetheart
i
answered
affecting
a
cheerfulness
i
was
far
from
feeling
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
family
history
i
had
to
go
out
that
evening
to
see
a
serious
case
in
consultation
with
a
brother
practitioner
i
had
ordered
the
dogcart
for
ten
and
evadne
came
out
into
the
hall
with
me
from
the
drawing
room
where
i
had
been
reading
to
her
since
dinner
when
it
was
brought
round
you
go
she
said
listlessly
i
am
afraid
i
must
i
answered
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
but
why
should
you
come
too
it
will
be
much
better
than
staying
here
alone
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
sooner
do
come
i
will
send
the
dogcart
back
and
have
the
brougham
it
would
delay
you
she
said
hesitating
oh
no
two
horses
in
the
brougham
will
get
over
the
ground
faster
than
one
in
the
dogcart
come
let
me
get
you
some
wraps
but
when
we
arrive
my
presence
will
be
an
inconvenience
she
objected
in
no
way
i
answered
it
will
not
be
a
long
business
and
you
can
wait
very
well
in
the
carriage
with
a
book
and
a
lamp
she
came
out
and
looked
at
the
night
still
undecided
the
weather
was
damp
and
uninviting
i
do
think
i
go
don
she
said
shivering
and
safe
home
to
you
as
i
drove
along
i
cast
about
in
my
own
mind
for
a
suitable
companion
for
evadne
someone
who
would
vary
the
monotony
for
her
when
i
had
to
be
out
she
had
no
ladyloves
as
so
many
women
have
orton
beg
was
at
fraylingay
again
and
lady
adeline
was
the
only
other
friend
i
knew
of
who
would
be
congenial
just
then
but
she
had
multifarious
duties
of
her
own
to
attend
to
and
it
would
not
have
been
fair
to
ask
her
especially
as
she
was
sure
to
come
if
she
knew
she
was
wanted
however
great
the
inconvenience
to
herself
i
knew
nothing
at
that
time
of
two
other
friends
of
evadne
sillinger
and
malcomson
to
whom
i
afterward
learnt
that
she
was
much
attached
owing
i
think
to
the
unnatural
habit
of
reticence
which
had
been
forced
upon
her
she
had
not
mentioned
them
to
me
although
she
continued
to
correspond
with
them
it
took
her
some
time
to
realize
that
every
interest
of
hers
was
matter
of
moment
to
me
a
certain
colonel
and
guthrie
brimston
had
recently
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
in
order
as
they
gave
out
to
be
near
the
morningquest
family
with
whom
they
claimed
relationship
on
the
ground
i
believe
that
they
also
were
guthries
colonel
guthrie
brimston
led
people
to
suppose
that
he
had
left
the
service
entirely
on
the
duke
account
his
disinterested
intention
being
to
vary
the
monotony
for
the
poor
old
gentleman
during
his
declining
years
they
had
claimed
acquaintance
with
effusion
but
she
had
not
responded
very
cordially
let
them
have
a
carriage
and
horses
whenever
they
like
don
she
said
and
give
them
plenty
to
eat
but
do
otherwise
encourage
them
to
come
here
recollecting
which
i
now
inferred
that
guthrie
brimston
would
not
answer
my
present
purpose
at
all
this
was
the
first
time
evadne
had
shown
any
objection
to
being
left
alone
she
used
to
insist
upon
my
going
away
sometimes
because
she
said
i
should
be
so
very
glad
to
come
back
to
her
but
she
was
never
exacting
in
any
way
and
never
out
of
temper
and
she
had
such
pretty
ways
as
a
wife
little
endearing
womanly
ways
which
one
felt
to
be
the
spontaneous
outcome
of
tenderness
untold
and
inexpressible
it
was
strange
how
her
presence
pervaded
the
house
strange
to
me
that
one
little
body
could
make
such
a
difference
foolishly
fond
if
you
like
but
if
every
man
could
care
as
much
for
a
woman
hallowed
would
be
her
name
and
the
uncertainties
of
heaven
and
hell
would
be
allowed
to
lapse
in
order
to
make
room
for
healthy
human
happiness
our
hearts
have
been
starved
upon
fables
long
enough
we
demand
some
certainty
and
as
knowledge
increases
waging
its
inexorable
war
of
extermination
against
evil
our
beautiful
old
earth
will
be
allowed
to
be
lovable
and
life
a
blessing
and
death
itself
only
a
last
sweet
sleep
neither
to
be
sought
nor
shunned
the
soothing
sinking
down
on
holy
rest
from
which
if
we
arise
again
it
shall
not
be
to
suffer
no
life
could
be
fuller
of
promise
than
mine
at
this
moment
nothing
was
wanting
but
the
patter
of
little
feet
about
the
house
and
they
were
coming
doubts
and
fears
were
latent
for
once
my
hopes
were
limitless
my
content
was
extreme
may
you
have
quiet
rest
my
darling
may
your
heart
grow
strong
and
your
faith
in
man
revive
at
last
about
halfway
to
my
destination
i
met
the
gentleman
who
had
asked
me
out
in
consultation
returning
he
was
on
his
way
to
my
house
to
tell
me
that
the
patient
was
dead
my
presence
could
therefore
be
of
no
avail
and
i
turned
back
also
i
had
not
been
absent
more
than
an
hour
but
i
found
on
entering
the
house
that
evadne
had
already
retired
it
was
a
good
sign
i
thought
as
she
had
been
rather
fidgety
the
whole
day
i
had
some
letters
to
write
and
went
at
once
to
my
study
for
the
purpose
taking
a
candle
with
me
from
the
hall
the
servants
not
expecting
me
back
until
late
had
turned
out
most
of
the
lights
downstairs
the
lamp
in
my
study
however
was
still
burning
it
stood
on
the
writing
table
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
on
entering
the
room
was
a
letter
lying
conspicuously
on
the
blotting
pad
it
was
from
evadne
to
me
she
had
evidently
intended
me
to
get
it
in
the
morning
for
a
tray
was
always
left
for
me
in
the
dining
room
in
case
i
should
be
hungry
when
i
came
in
late
and
my
chances
were
all
against
my
going
to
the
study
again
that
night
i
put
my
candle
down
and
tore
the
note
open
with
trembling
hands
the
first
few
lines
were
enough
i
am
haunted
by
a
terrible
fear
she
wrote
i
have
tried
again
and
again
to
tell
you
but
i
never
could
you
would
not
see
that
it
is
prophetic
as
i
do
in
case
of
our
death
nothing
to
save
my
daughter
from
edith
fate
better
both
die
at
once
so
i
gathered
the
contents
no
time
to
read
i
crumpled
the
note
into
my
pocket
my
labouring
breath
impeded
my
progress
a
moment
but
thank
heaven
i
was
not
paralyzed
involuntarily
i
glanced
at
my
laboratory
it
was
an
inner
room
kept
locked
as
a
rule
but
the
door
was
open
now
as
i
knew
i
had
expected
it
to
be
i
seized
the
candle
and
went
to
the
shelf
where
i
kept
the
bottles
with
the
ominous
red
labels
one
was
missing
evadne
i
shouted
running
back
through
the
study
and
library
into
the
hall
and
calling
her
again
and
again
as
i
went
if
it
were
not
already
too
late
and
she
had
heard
my
voice
i
knew
she
would
hesitate
i
tore
up
the
stairs
and
i
must
have
flown
although
it
seemed
a
century
before
i
reached
her
room
i
flung
open
the
door
she
heard
me
she
was
standing
beside
a
dressing
table
in
a
listening
attitude
with
a
glass
half
raised
to
her
lips
and
her
eyes
met
mine
as
i
entered
my
first
cry
of
distress
had
reached
her
and
the
shock
of
it
had
been
sufficient
had
that
note
fallen
into
my
hands
but
one
moment
later
but
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
even
at
this
distance
of
time
the
recollection
utterly
unmans
me
the
moment
i
saw
her
however
i
could
command
myself
i
took
the
glass
from
her
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
fireplace
with
as
little
show
of
haste
as
possible
to
bed
now
my
sweetheart
i
said
and
no
more
nonsense
of
this
kind
you
know
she
looked
at
the
fragments
of
the
broken
glass
and
then
at
me
in
a
half
wondering
half
regretful
half
inquiring
way
that
was
pitiful
to
see
shaken
as
i
was
i
could
not
bear
it
while
the
danger
lasted
it
was
no
effort
to
be
calm
but
now
i
broke
down
and
throwing
myself
into
a
chair
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
thoroughly
overcome
in
a
moment
she
was
kneeling
beside
me
o
don
she
exclaimed
what
is
it
why
are
you
so
terribly
upset
poor
little
innocent
sinner
the
one
idea
had
possessed
her
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
consideration
i
said
nothing
to
her
of
course
in
the
way
of
blame
it
would
have
been
useless
she
was
bitterly
sorry
to
see
me
grieved
but
her
moral
consciousness
was
suspended
and
she
felt
no
remorse
whatever
for
her
intention
except
in
so
far
as
it
had
given
me
pain
the
impulse
had
passed
for
the
moment
however
and
i
was
so
sure
of
it
that
i
did
not
even
take
the
fatal
phial
away
with
me
when
i
went
to
my
dressing
room
but
for
days
and
nights
i
never
left
her
an
hour
alone
the
one
great
hope
however
that
the
cruel
obliquity
would
be
cured
by
the
mother
love
when
it
awoke
amply
sustained
me
she
was
well
and
cheerful
for
the
rest
of
the
time
greatly
owing
i
am
sure
to
the
influence
of
sir
shadwell
rock
who
came
at
once
like
the
kind
and
generous
friend
he
was
without
waiting
to
be
asked
when
he
heard
what
had
happened
and
announced
himself
prepared
to
stay
until
the
danger
was
over
i
heard
evadne
laugh
very
soon
after
his
arrival
and
could
see
that
the
worry
in
her
head
as
she
described
it
had
gone
again
and
was
forgotten
the
impulse
which
would
have
robbed
me
of
all
my
happiness
and
hopes
had
she
succeeded
in
carrying
it
out
never
cost
her
a
thought
the
saving
suffering
of
an
agony
of
remorse
was
what
we
should
like
to
have
seen
for
in
that
there
would
have
been
good
assurance
of
healthy
moral
consciousness
restored
it
seemed
to
be
only
the
power
to
endure
mental
misery
which
had
been
injured
by
those
weary
days
of
enforced
seclusion
and
unnatural
inactivity
for
i
never
knew
anyone
braver
about
physical
pain
it
was
the
strength
to
contemplate
the
sufferings
of
others
which
grows
in
action
and
is
best
developed
by
turning
the
knowledge
to
account
for
their
benefit
that
had
been
sapped
by
ineffectual
brooding
until
at
last
before
the
moral
shock
of
indignation
which
the
view
of
preventable
human
evils
gave
her
her
right
mind
simply
went
out
and
a
disordered
faculty
filled
the
void
with
projects
which
only
a
perverted
imagination
could
contemplate
as
being
of
any
avail
whatever
doubts
we
may
have
had
about
her
feeling
for
the
child
when
it
came
were
instantly
set
at
rest
nothing
could
have
been
healthier
or
more
natural
than
her
pride
and
delight
in
him
when
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
after
he
was
dressed
i
brought
him
to
her
myself
with
his
little
cheek
against
my
face
o
don
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
opening
wide
with
joy
i
love
to
see
you
like
that
but
what
is
she
like
don
give
her
to
me
indeed
i
answered
do
insult
my
son
he
would
reproach
you
himself
but
he
is
speechless
with
indignation
o
don
do
be
ridiculous
she
cried
stretching
up
her
arms
for
him
is
it
really
a
boy
do
give
him
to
me
i
want
to
see
him
so
when
i
had
put
him
in
her
arms
she
gathered
him
up
jealously
and
covered
him
with
kisses
then
held
him
off
a
little
way
to
look
at
him
and
then
kissed
him
again
and
again
did
you
ever
see
a
baby
before
i
asked
her
no
never
never
she
answered
emphatically
never
such
a
darling
as
this
at
all
events
his
little
cheek
is
just
like
velvet
and
see
he
can
curl
up
his
hands
is
it
wonderful
don
he
like
you
too
sure
he
is
he
quite
dark
he
just
the
colour
of
that
last
sunset
you
were
raving
about
i
told
you
to
be
careful
o
don
how
can
you
she
exclaimed
it
was
beautiful
to
see
her
raptures
she
was
like
a
child
herself
so
unaffectedly
glad
in
her
precious
little
treasure
and
so
surprised
the
fact
that
he
would
move
independently
and
have
ideas
of
his
own
seemed
never
to
have
occurred
to
her
so
far
so
good
as
sir
shadwell
said
and
we
soon
had
her
about
again
but
the
first
time
she
sat
up
after
her
cushions
had
been
arranged
for
her
and
her
baby
laid
on
her
lap
when
i
stooped
to
give
them
both
a
kiss
of
hearty
congratulation
she
burst
into
tears
it
is
nothing
don
do
be
concerned
she
said
trying
bravely
to
smile
again
i
was
thinking
of
my
mother
this
would
have
been
such
a
happy
day
for
her
this
made
me
think
of
the
breach
with
her
father
i
had
forgotten
that
she
had
a
father
but
it
occurred
to
me
now
that
a
reconciliation
might
add
to
her
happiness
and
i
wrote
to
him
accordingly
to
that
effect
making
the
little
grandson
my
excuse
frayling
replied
that
he
had
heard
indirectly
of
his
daughter
second
marriage
but
was
not
surprised
to
receive
no
communication
from
herself
on
the
subject
because
her
whole
conduct
for
many
years
past
had
really
been
most
extraordinary
if
however
she
had
become
a
dutiful
wife
at
last
as
i
had
intimated
he
was
willing
to
forgive
her
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
whereupon
i
asked
him
to
fountain
towers
and
he
came
he
was
extremely
cordial
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
before
he
saw
evadne
during
which
i
discovered
from
whence
she
took
her
trick
of
he
expressed
himself
as
satisfied
with
me
and
my
position
my
reputation
and
my
place
he
also
shook
his
watch
chain
at
my
son
which
denoted
great
approval
i
inferred
and
made
many
improving
remarks
interspersed
with
much
good
advice
on
the
subject
of
babies
and
the
management
of
estates
evadne
had
been
very
nervous
about
meeting
him
again
but
the
baby
broke
the
ice
and
she
was
unfeignedly
glad
to
make
friends
upon
the
whole
however
the
reconciliation
was
not
the
success
that
i
had
anticipated
father
and
daughter
had
lost
touch
and
after
the
first
few
hours
there
was
neither
pleasure
nor
pain
in
their
intercourse
nothing
in
fact
but
politeness
the
flow
of
affection
had
been
too
long
interrupted
it
was
diverted
to
other
channels
now
and
was
too
deeply
imbedded
in
them
to
be
coaxed
back
in
the
old
direction
love
is
a
sacred
stream
which
withdraws
itself
from
the
sacrilegious
who
have
offered
it
outrage
it
was
an
unmitigated
happiness
however
to
evadne
to
have
her
brothers
and
sisters
with
her
again
and
from
that
time
forward
we
bad
generally
some
of
them
at
fountain
towers
kilroy
of
ilverthorpe
otherwise
known
to
her
friends
as
angelica
was
one
of
the
first
people
privileged
to
see
the
baby
oh
you
queer
little
thing
she
exclaimed
pointing
her
finger
at
it
by
way
of
caress
i
been
thinking
all
this
time
that
babies
were
always
speckled
toads
and
you
are
all
rosy
and
dimpled
and
plump
you
pretty
thing
i
wish
i
had
just
a
dozen
like
you
poor
erratic
angelica
with
all
her
waywardness
but
yet
a
woman
there
was
only
the
one
man
that
i
have
ever
known
who
could
have
developed
the
best
that
was
in
angelica
and
him
she
had
just
missed
as
so
often
happens
in
this
world
of
contraries
i
am
thinking
of
our
poor
julian
known
to
her
as
the
tenor
whom
she
had
met
when
it
was
too
late
and
in
an
evil
hour
for
us
and
for
herself
apparently
the
consequences
having
been
his
death
and
her
own
desolation
yet
i
do
know
those
were
the
first
consequences
certainly
but
others
followed
and
are
following
the
memory
of
one
good
man
is
a
light
which
sheds
the
brightest
rays
that
fall
on
the
lives
of
thousands
as
kilroy
has
reason
to
know
with
whom
after
the
tenor
angelica
is
happier
than
she
could
have
been
with
any
other
man
and
then
again
she
has
diavolo
the
close
friendship
between
them
which
had
been
interrupted
for
some
years
was
renewed
again
in
some
inexplicable
way
by
the
effect
of
my
marriage
on
diavolo
and
since
then
they
have
been
as
inseparable
as
their
respective
duties
to
husband
and
grandfather
allow
and
so
the
web
of
life
is
woven
the
puzzling
strands
resolving
themselves
out
of
what
has
seemed
to
be
a
hopeless
tangle
into
the
most
beautiful
designs
some
of
evadne
ideas
of
life
were
considerably
enlarged
in
view
of
the
boy
future
i
am
so
glad
you
are
a
rich
man
she
said
to
me
one
day
and
have
a
title
and
all
that
it
does
matter
for
you
you
know
don
because
you
you
but
it
will
give
the
baby
such
a
start
in
life
she
summoned
me
at
a
very
early
period
of
his
existence
to
choose
a
name
for
him
and
having
decided
upon
george
shadwell
beton
she
had
him
christened
with
all
orthodox
ceremony
by
the
bishop
of
morningquest
as
soon
as
possible
that
duty
once
accomplished
must
have
relieved
her
mind
satisfactorily
with
regard
to
a
name
for
him
for
she
has
insisted
on
calling
him
by
the
heathen
appellation
of
donino
ever
since
for
the
flattering
reason
that
his
temper
when
thwarted
is
exactly
like
mine
i
am
sure
when
you
were
his
age
you
used
to
kick
and
scream
just
as
he
does
when
his
wishes
are
not
carried
out
on
the
instant
she
said
you
do
kick
and
scream
now
when
you
are
vexed
you
look
like
thunder
and
walk
out
of
the
room
baby
seems
to
afford
you
infinite
satisfaction
when
he
kicks
and
screams
you
laugh
and
hug
him
more
if
anything
in
his
tantrums
than
when
he
is
good
i
remarked
i
take
his
tantrums
for
a
sign
of
strength
she
answered
he
is
merely
standing
on
his
dignity
and
demanding
his
rights
as
a
rule
it
was
the
same
thing
with
his
father
when
he
frowned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
he
would
be
sat
upon
either
and
i
used
to
see
in
that
a
sign
of
also
it
is
a
long
time
now
since
i
saw
you
frown
and
walk
out
of
the
room
don
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
attempted
to
sit
upon
me
i
said
i
am
afraid
i
neglect
you
she
answered
apologetically
you
see
donino
requires
so
much
of
my
time
she
continued
to
be
cheerful
for
months
after
the
birth
of
the
boy
and
we
waited
patiently
for
some
sign
which
should
be
an
assurance
of
her
complete
restoration
to
mental
health
or
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
for
an
opportunity
of
testing
her
present
feeling
about
the
subject
that
distressed
her
i
had
given
up
expecting
a
miraculous
cure
in
a
moment
and
now
only
hoped
for
a
gradual
change
for
the
better
the
opportunity
i
was
waiting
for
came
one
winter
afternoon
when
she
was
playing
with
the
baby
it
was
a
moment
of
leisure
with
me
the
afternoon
which
i
always
arranged
to
spend
with
her
if
possible
and
especially
if
she
would
otherwise
have
been
alone
as
was
the
case
on
this
occasion
i
had
been
responding
for
half
an
hour
as
well
as
i
could
to
incessant
appeals
for
sympathy
and
admiration
not
that
i
found
it
difficult
to
admire
the
boy
who
was
certainly
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
human
race
although
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
so
but
my
command
of
language
never
answered
his
mother
expectations
somehow
when
it
came
to
expressing
my
feelings
do
you
think
you
care
as
much
for
him
as
i
do
don
she
burst
out
at
last
more
i
answered
seriously
why
how
she
demanded
surprised
by
my
tone
because
i
never
could
have
hurt
him
hurt
him
she
exclaimed
gathering
him
up
in
her
arms
do
you
mean
that
i
could
hurt
him
hurt
my
baby
oh
she
got
up
and
stood
looking
at
me
indignantly
for
a
few
seconds
with
the
child
face
hidden
against
her
neck
and
then
she
rang
the
bell
sharply
and
sent
him
away
what
do
you
mean
don
she
said
when
we
were
alone
together
again
tell
me
you
would
not
say
a
cruel
thing
like
that
for
nothing
i
am
referring
to
that
night
before
he
was
born
i
said
taking
the
little
bottle
from
my
pocket
this
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
cruellest
operation
that
i
have
ever
had
to
perform
o
don
she
cried
greatly
distressed
i
understand
i
should
have
killed
him
but
why
why
do
you
remind
me
of
that
now
i
want
to
be
quite
sure
that
you
have
learnt
what
a
mistaken
notion
that
was
and
that
you
regret
the
impulse
she
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
remained
so
for
some
time
she
wanted
to
think
it
out
and
tell
me
exactly
i
do
not
feel
any
regret
she
said
at
last
i
would
not
do
the
same
thing
now
but
it
is
only
because
i
am
not
now
occupied
with
the
same
thoughts
they
have
fallen
into
the
background
of
my
consciousness
and
i
no
longer
perceive
the
utility
of
but
do
you
not
perceive
the
sin
of
suicide
not
of
that
kind
of
suicide
she
answered
you
see
we
have
the
divine
example
christ
committed
suicide
to
all
intents
and
purposes
by
deliberately
putting
himself
into
the
hands
of
his
executioners
but
his
motive
makes
responsible
for
the
crime
and
my
motive
would
place
society
in
a
similar
position
your
view
of
the
great
sacrifice
would
startle
theologians
i
imagine
was
my
answer
but
even
allowing
that
christ
was
morally
responsible
for
his
own
death
and
thereby
set
the
example
you
would
have
followed
to
save
others
from
suffering
tell
me
do
you
really
see
any
comparison
between
an
act
which
had
the
redemption
of
the
world
for
its
object
and
the
only
result
that
could
follow
from
the
sacrifice
of
one
little
mother
and
child
what
result
don
breaking
your
husband
heart
spoiling
his
life
and
leaving
him
lonely
forever
she
started
up
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
me
clasping
her
hands
about
my
neck
o
don
do
say
that
again
she
cried
do
say
anything
like
that
again
ever
will
you
you
know
i
should
never
think
of
it
again
if
i
could
be
sure
she
hid
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
but
did
not
answer
immediately
i
am
seeking
for
some
assurance
in
myself
to
give
you
she
said
at
last
but
i
feel
none
the
same
train
of
thought
would
provoke
me
again
no
not
to
the
same
act
but
to
something
desperate
i
ca
tell
what
but
i
suffer
so
don
when
such
thoughts
come
from
grief
and
rage
and
horror
i
would
do
almost
anything
for
relief
but
just
think
i
began
no
do
ask
me
to
think
she
interrupted
all
my
endeavour
is
not
to
think
let
me
live
on
the
surface
of
life
as
most
women
do
i
will
do
nothing
but
attend
to
my
household
duties
and
the
social
duties
of
my
position
i
will
read
nothing
that
is
not
first
weeded
by
you
of
every
painful
thought
that
might
remind
me
i
will
play
with
my
baby
by
day
and
curl
up
comfortably
beside
you
at
night
infinitely
grateful
and
content
to
be
so
happily
circumstanced
myself
don
help
me
to
that
kind
of
life
will
you
and
burn
the
books
let
me
deserve
my
name
and
be
pleasing
one
to
you
first
of
all
the
world
and
then
to
any
with
whom
i
may
come
in
contact
let
me
live
while
you
live
and
die
when
you
die
but
do
not
ask
me
to
think
i
can
be
the
most
docile
the
most
obedient
the
most
loving
of
women
as
long
as
i
forget
my
knowledge
of
life
but
the
moment
i
remember
i
become
a
raging
fury
i
have
no
patience
with
slow
processes
would
be
my
cry
and
i
could
preside
with
an
awful
joy
at
the
execution
of
those
who
are
making
the
misery
now
for
succeeding
generations
but
my
dear
child
it
would
surely
be
happier
for
you
to
try
to
alleviate
no
no
she
again
interrupted
i
know
all
you
can
say
on
that
score
but
i
can
not
bear
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
certain
forms
of
suffering
i
can
not
bear
the
contradictions
of
life
they
make
me
rage
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
you
should
act
and
not
think
i
ventured
how
can
i
act
without
thinking
she
asked
you
see
if
you
do
act
you
must
think
i
pursued
and
if
you
do
think
without
acting
you
become
morbid
the
conditions
of
an
educated
woman
life
now
force
her
to
know
the
world
she
is
too
intelligent
not
to
reason
about
what
she
knows
she
sees
what
is
wrong
and
if
she
is
she
feels
forced
to
use
her
influence
to
combat
it
if
she
resists
the
impulse
her
conscience
can
not
acquit
her
and
she
suffers
herself
for
her
cowardice
i
know
she
answered
but
do
let
us
discuss
the
subject
any
more
we
were
silent
for
some
time
after
that
and
then
i
made
a
move
as
if
to
speak
but
checked
myself
what
is
it
she
asked
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
do
something
to
oblige
me
but
now
i
do
not
like
to
oh
she
exclaimed
much
hurt
do
you
really
think
there
is
anything
i
would
not
do
for
you
if
i
could
well
this
is
mere
trifle
i
answered
i
want
you
to
take
that
sturdy
much
darling
of
yours
to
see
my
poor
sick
souls
in
the
hospital
a
sight
of
his
small
face
would
cheer
them
will
you
why
she
said
how
you
doubt
it
i
shall
be
delighted
and
there
was
another
thing
oh
do
hesitate
like
that
she
exclaimed
you
ca
think
how
you
hurt
me
i
very
much
wish
you
would
take
charge
of
the
flowers
in
the
hospital
for
me
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
should
be
so
pleased
if
you
should
make
them
your
special
care
if
you
would
cut
them
yourself
and
take
them
and
arrange
them
whenever
fresh
ones
are
wanted
you
would
be
giving
me
as
much
pleasure
as
the
patients
and
you
might
say
something
kind
to
them
as
you
pass
through
the
wards
even
a
word
makes
all
the
difference
in
their
day
why
did
you
ask
me
to
do
this
before
she
said
reproachfully
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
asking
you
now
i
answered
i
shall
begin
she
said
tell
me
the
best
time
for
me
to
go
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
way
a
thing
is
put
was
my
trite
reflection
afterward
if
i
had
given
evadne
my
reason
for
particularly
wishing
her
to
visit
the
hospital
she
would
have
turned
it
inside
out
to
show
me
that
it
was
lined
with
objections
but
now
because
i
had
asked
her
to
oblige
me
simply
she
was
ready
to
go
and
would
have
gone
if
had
cost
her
half
her
comfort
in
life
this
was
a
great
step
in
advance
as
in
the
epidemic
so
now
at
the
hospital
she
had
no
horror
of
anything
she
it
was
always
what
she
imagined
that
made
her
morbid
chapter
xix
following
these
days
there
came
a
time
of
perfect
peace
for
both
of
us
evadne
health
was
satisfactory
she
led
the
life
she
had
planned
for
herself
and
so
long
as
she
shut
out
all
thought
of
the
wicked
world
and
nothing
occurred
to
remind
her
of
the
awful
needless
suffering
with
which
she
had
become
acquainted
in
the
past
she
was
tranquilly
happy
donino
rapidly
grew
out
of
arms
he
was
an
independent
young
rascal
from
the
first
and
would
never
be
carried
if
he
could
walk
or
driven
from
the
moment
he
could
sit
a
pony
grip
is
the
word
i
know
but
his
legs
were
not
long
enough
to
grip
when
he
began
and
his
rides
were
therefore
conducted
all
over
the
pony
back
at
first
his
object
was
to
keep
on
and
in
order
to
do
so
without
the
assistance
he
scorned
he
rode
like
a
monkey
evadne
was
proud
of
the
boy
but
she
missed
the
baby
and
complained
that
her
arms
were
empty
it
was
not
long
however
happily
and
of
the
number
of
my
responsibilities
i
was
taken
to
task
severely
one
day
and
discovered
that
i
had
in
my
son
a
staunch
supporter
and
a
counsellor
whose
astuteness
was
not
to
be
despised
i
was
finishing
my
letters
one
afternoon
in
the
library
when
evadne
came
in
with
her
daughter
in
her
arms
and
donino
clinging
to
her
skirt
i
expected
the
usual
don
i
am
sure
you
have
done
enough
come
and
have
some
tea
and
turned
to
meet
it
with
the
accustomed
protest
just
five
minutes
more
my
sweetheart
but
evadne
began
in
quite
another
tone
i
have
just
heard
such
a
thing
about
you
she
said
a
disgraceful
thing
about
me
i
exclaimed
yes
i
hear
you
were
asked
the
other
day
how
many
children
you
had
and
you
answered
or
three
now
will
you
kindly
count
your
children
and
when
you
are
quite
sure
you
know
the
number
off
by
heart
repeat
it
aloud
to
me
so
that
i
may
have
some
hope
that
you
will
not
commit
yourself
in
that
way
again
oh
i
answered
i
know
how
many
there
are
my
difficulty
is
about
you
i
am
never
quite
sure
whether
to
count
you
as
a
child
or
not
now
i
call
that
a
mean
little
score
she
said
carrying
her
baby
off
with
an
affectation
of
indignation
which
deceived
donino
he
had
been
standing
with
his
back
to
the
writing
table
and
his
feet
firmly
planted
before
him
gravely
watching
us
and
now
when
his
mother
left
the
room
he
came
to
my
knee
and
looked
up
at
me
confidentially
ou
bin
naughty
dad
he
asked
it
looks
like
it
i
answered
ou
say
ou
sorry
he
advised
what
will
happen
then
i
wanted
to
know
den
de
missus
kiss
ou
he
explained
den
all
right
truly
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
father
i
observed
donino
knitted
his
brows
and
grumbled
a
puzzled
but
polite
assent
i
saw
signs
of
reflection
afterward
however
which
warned
me
not
to
be
too
sure
that
i
knew
exactly
where
the
limits
of
the
little
understanding
were
but
one
thing
was
evident
the
boy
was
being
educated
on
the
principle
of
repent
and
have
done
with
it
old
accounts
are
not
cast
up
in
this
establishment
donino
watched
me
putting
my
writing
things
away
he
was
waiting
to
see
me
through
my
trouble
when
i
was
ready
he
took
as
much
of
my
hand
as
he
could
hold
in
his
protectingly
and
led
me
to
the
drawing
room
with
a
dignified
air
of
importance
sir
shadwell
rock
was
staying
with
us
at
the
time
and
my
daughter
was
creeping
from
her
mother
to
him
as
we
entered
the
room
and
receiving
a
large
share
of
his
attention
donino
glanced
at
him
fearing
perhaps
that
his
presence
as
audience
would
make
matters
more
unpleasant
for
me
mumme
he
said
dad
turn
evadne
looked
up
inquiringly
i
come
to
say
i
am
sorry
i
exclaimed
oh
said
evadne
a
little
puzzled
that
right
donino
looked
from
one
to
the
other
expectantly
but
as
his
mother
made
no
move
he
edged
up
to
her
side
and
repeated
with
emphasis
dad
sorry
that
right
his
mother
answered
putting
her
arm
round
him
and
caressing
him
fondly
he
drew
away
from
her
dissatisfied
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
stood
with
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
and
his
chin
on
his
chest
o
don
evadne
whispered
do
look
at
yourself
in
miniature
but
what
is
the
matter
what
have
i
done
to
disturb
him
or
left
undone
i
said
i
was
sorry
and
you
have
kissed
me
i
replied
evadne
grasped
the
situation
at
last
and
got
up
i
suppose
i
must
kiss
you
she
said
i
hope
you
wo
be
naughty
again
the
boy
made
no
sign
at
the
moment
but
presently
he
sauntered
back
to
the
as
if
he
were
satisfied
when
the
children
were
gone
sir
shadwell
asked
for
an
explanation
it
is
beautiful
to
watch
the
mind
of
a
young
child
unfold
he
observed
to
notice
its
wonderful
grasp
on
the
one
hand
of
ideas
one
would
have
thought
quite
beyond
its
comprehension
and
on
the
other
its
curious
limitations
now
that
boy
of
yours
reasons
already
from
what
he
observes
clearly
i
answered
he
observes
that
my
position
in
this
house
is
quite
secondary
and
therefore
although
he
sees
his
mother
every
day
he
never
thinks
for
a
moment
of
suggesting
that
she
should
up
to
me
don
you
are
horrid
evadne
exclaimed
the
next
day
she
went
out
early
in
the
afternoon
to
pay
calls
sir
shadwell
and
i
accompanied
her
to
the
door
to
see
her
into
her
carriage
and
she
drove
off
smiling
and
kissing
her
hand
to
us
now
i
said
as
we
lingered
on
the
doorstep
watching
the
carriage
glint
between
the
trees
what
do
you
think
about
the
wisdom
of
my
marriage
oh
he
answered
his
eyes
twinkling
you
did
explain
you
know
so
i
naturally
concluded
that
you
were
merely
marrying
for
your
own
gratification
in
which
case
you
would
have
been
disappointed
when
you
found
what
i
foresaw
that
under
the
circumstances
the
pleasure
would
not
be
unmixed
you
should
have
explained
that
your
sole
purpose
was
to
make
a
very
charming
young
lady
again
and
happy
if
you
wanted
to
know
what
i
thought
of
your
chances
of
success
you
a
confounded
old
cynic
i
said
turning
into
the
house
sir
shadwell
went
out
into
the
grounds
and
there
i
found
him
later
patiently
instructing
donino
in
the
difficult
art
of
stringing
a
bow
his
white
head
bowed
beside
the
boy
dark
one
and
his
benign
face
wrought
into
wrinkles
of
intentness
i
was
busy
during
the
afternoon
but
i
fancied
i
heard
the
carriage
return
evadne
did
not
come
to
report
herself
to
me
however
as
was
her
wont
after
an
expedition
and
i
therefore
thought
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
and
more
especially
so
when
she
did
not
appear
at
after
tea
sir
shadwell
settled
himself
with
a
book
and
i
left
him
in
the
hall
i
met
the
footman
who
had
gone
out
with
evadne
when
did
you
return
i
asked
i
ca
say
rightly
sir
george
the
man
replied
we
only
paid
one
call
this
afternoon
and
then
came
straight
back
her
ladyship
seemed
to
be
poorly
i
ran
upstairs
to
my
wife
sitting
room
she
was
lying
on
a
couch
asleep
her
face
gray
her
eyelids
swollen
and
purple
with
weeping
her
hair
disordered
as
i
stood
looking
down
at
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
held
up
her
arms
to
me
she
looked
ten
years
older
a
mere
wreck
of
the
healthy
happy
smiling
woman
who
had
driven
off
kissing
her
hand
to
us
only
a
few
hours
before
tell
me
the
trouble
my
sweetheart
i
said
kneeling
down
beside
her
where
did
you
go
only
to
guthrie
brimston
she
answered
but
beale
was
there
with
edith
boy
and
we
talked
o
don
she
broke
off
i
wish
my
children
had
never
been
born
the
suffering
the
awful
needless
suffering
how
do
i
know
that
they
will
escape
alas
alas
that
terrible
cry
again
and
just
after
we
had
allowed
ourselves
to
be
sure
that
it
had
been
silenced
at
last
forever
i
did
not
reason
with
her
this
time
i
could
only
pet
her
and
talk
for
the
purpose
of
distracting
her
attention
as
one
does
with
a
child
so
far
i
had
never
for
a
moment
lost
heart
and
hope
i
could
not
believe
that
the
balance
of
her
fine
intelligence
had
been
too
rudely
shaken
ever
to
be
perfectly
restored
but
now
at
last
it
seemed
as
if
her
confidence
in
her
the
source
of
all
mental
health
had
been
destroyed
forever
and
with
that
confidence
her
sense
of
the
value
of
life
and
of
her
own
obligations
had
been
also
injured
or
distorted
to
a
degree
which
could
not
fail
to
be
dangerous
on
occasion
there
are
injuries
which
set
up
carcinoma
of
the
mind
we
know
cancer
spots
confined
to
a
small
area
at
first
but
gradually
extending
with
infinite
pain
until
all
the
surrounding
healthy
tissue
is
more
or
less
involved
and
the
whole
beautiful
fabric
is
absorbed
in
the
morbid
growth
for
which
there
is
no
certain
palliative
in
time
and
no
possible
prospect
of
cure
except
in
eternity
was
this
to
be
evadne
case
alas
alas
but
still
doctors
sometimes
mistake
the
symptoms
and
find
happily
that
they
have
erred
when
they
arrived
at
an
unfavourable
diagnosis
so
i
said
to
myself
but
the
assurance
in
no
way
affected
the
despair
which
had
settled
upon
my
heart
and
was
crushing
it
late
that
night
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
study
i
had
been
reading
solomon
prayer
at
the
dedication
of
the
temple
and
the
book
still
lay
open
before
me
it
was
a
habit
of
mine
to
read
the
bible
when
i
was
much
perturbed
the
solemn
majestic
march
of
the
measured
words
seldom
failed
to
restore
my
tranquillity
in
a
wonderful
way
and
it
had
done
so
now
i
felt
resigned
hearken
therefore
unto
the
supplication
of
thy
servant
i
was
repeating
to
myself
in
fragments
as
the
lines
occurred
to
me
that
thine
eyes
may
be
upon
this
house
day
and
night
hear
thou
from
thy
dwelling
place
even
from
heaven
and
when
thou
hearest
forgive
i
must
have
dozed
a
moment
i
think
when
i
had
pronounced
the
words
for
i
had
heard
no
rustle
of
trailing
garments
in
the
library
beyond
yet
the
next
thing
i
was
conscious
of
was
evadne
kneeling
beside
me
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
drew
my
face
down
to
her
don
she
said
with
a
great
dry
sob
i
am
sorry
i
have
annoyed
you
somehow
not
annoyed
me
my
wife
hurt
you
then
which
is
worse
i
have
taken
all
the
heart
out
of
you
somehow
i
can
see
that
but
i
can
not
can
not
tell
what
it
is
i
have
done
she
looked
into
my
face
piteously
and
then
hid
her
own
on
my
shoulder
and
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
and
tears
if
only
i
could
have
made
her
comprehend
what
the
trouble
was
but
there
i
tried
and
i
had
failed
one
little
white
foot
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
dressing
gown
the
pink
sole
showing
she
had
got
out
of
bed
and
slipped
on
her
only
and
the
night
was
cold
i
might
have
thought
that
she
would
lie
awake
fretting
if
she
were
left
alone
on
a
night
when
her
mind
was
so
disturbed
and
here
had
i
been
seeking
solace
myself
and
forgetting
that
great
as
my
own
trouble
was
hers
must
surpass
it
even
as
the
infinite
does
the
finite
but
that
error
i
could
repair
i
hoped
and
it
should
never
be
repeated
come
my
sweetheart
i
said
gathering
her
up
close
in
my
arms
so
long
as
you
will
let
me
be
a
comfort
to
you
you
will
not
be
able
to
hurt
me
again
but
if
at
any
time
you
will
not
listen
to
my
words
if
nothing
i
can
do
or
say
strengthens
or
helps
you
if
i
can
not
keep
you
from
the
evil
that
it
may
not
grieve
you
then
i
shall
know
that
i
have
lost
all
that
makes
life
worth
having
and
i
shall
not
care
how
soon
this
lamp
of
mine
goes
out
she
looked
up
at
me
in
a
strange
startled
way
and
then
she
clung
closer
and
i
thought
she
meant
that
if
she
could
help
it
i
should
not
lose
the
little
all
i
ask
for
now
the
power
to
make
her
life
endurable
the
end
