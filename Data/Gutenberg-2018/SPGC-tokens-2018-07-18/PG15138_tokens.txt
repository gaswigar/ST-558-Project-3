we

a
postscript
by
the
chronicler
illustrations
sylvia
and
professor
kelton
whoever
wrote
that
letter
was
troubled
about
sylvia
a
sudden
fierce
anger
burned
in
her
heart
sylvia
must
know
just
what
we
know
drawings
by
a
hoosier
chronicle
chapter
i
my
lady
of
the
constellations
sylvia
was
reading
in
her
grandfather
library
when
the
bell
tinkled
professor
kelton
had
few
callers
and
as
there
was
never
any
certainty
that
the
would
trouble
herself
to
answer
sylvia
put
down
her
book
and
went
to
the
door
very
likely
it
was
a
student
or
a
member
of
the
faculty
and
as
her
grandfather
was
not
at
home
sylvia
was
quite
sure
that
the
interruption
would
be
the
briefest
the
kelton
cottage
stood
just
off
the
campus
and
was
separated
from
it
by
a
narrow
street
that
curved
round
the
college
and
stole
after
many
twists
and
turns
into
town
this
thoroughfare
was
called
buckeye
lane
or
more
commonly
the
lane
the
college
had
been
planted
literally
in
the
wilderness
by
its
founders
at
a
time
when
montgomery
for
all
its
dignity
as
the
seat
of
the
county
court
was
the
most
colorless
of
hoosier
hamlets
save
only
as
the
prevailing
mud
colored
everything
buckeye
lane
was
originally
a
in
the
good
old
times
when
every
reputable
villager
kept
a
red
cow
and
pastured
it
in
the
woodlot
that
subsequently
became
madison
athletic
field
in
those
days
the
madison
faculty
and
their
wives
and
daughters
seeking
social
diversion
among
the
hospitable
townfolk
picked
their
way
down
the
lane
by
lantern
light
an
ignorant
municipal
council
had
later
when
natural
gas
threatened
to
boom
the
town
into
cityhood
changed
buckeye
lane
to
university
avenue
but
the
community
refused
to
countenance
any
such
impious
trifling
with
tradition
and
besides
madison
prided
herself
then
as
now
on
being
a
college
that
taught
the
humanities
in
all
soberness
according
to
ideals
brought
out
of
new
england
by
its
founders
the
proposed
change
caused
an
historic
clash
between
town
and
gown
in
which
the
gown
triumphed
university
forsooth
professor
kelton
house
was
guarded
on
all
sides
by
trees
and
shrubbery
and
a
tall
privet
hedge
shut
it
off
from
the
lane
he
tended
with
his
own
hands
a
flower
garden
whose
roses
were
the
despair
of
all
the
women
of
the
community
the
clapboards
of
the
simple
cottage
had
faded
to
a
dull
gray
but
the
little
plot
of
ground
in
which
the
house
stood
was
cultivated
with
scrupulous
care
the
lawn
was
always
fresh
and
crisp
the
borders
of
privet
were
neatly
trimmed
and
the
flower
beds
disposed
effectively
a
woman
would
have
seen
at
once
that
this
was
a
man
work
it
was
all
a
little
too
regular
suggesting
engineering
methods
rather
than
polite
gardening
once
you
had
stepped
inside
the
cottage
the
absence
of
the
feminine
touch
was
even
more
strikingly
apparent
book
shelves
crowded
to
the
door
open
shelves
that
had
the
effect
of
pressing
at
once
upon
the
visitor
the
most
formidable
of
dingy
volumes
signifying
that
such
things
were
of
moment
to
the
master
of
the
house
there
was
no
parlor
for
the
room
that
had
originally
been
used
as
such
was
now
and
and
served
as
an
approach
to
the
study
into
which
it
opened
the
furniture
was
old
and
frayed
as
to
upholstery
and
the
on
an
was
faintly
murmurous
of
some
feminine
hand
the
scant
lares
and
penates
were
sufficient
to
explain
something
of
this
shiplike
trimness
of
the
housekeeping
the
broken
half
of
a
ship
wheel
clung
to
the
wall
above
the
narrow
grate
and
the
white
marble
mantel
supported
a
sextant
a
binocular
and
other
incidentals
of
a
shipmaster
profession
an
engraving
of
the
battle
of
trafalgar
and
a
portrait
of
farragut
spoke
further
of
the
sea
if
we
take
a
liberty
and
run
our
eyes
over
the
bookshelves
we
find
many
volumes
relating
to
the
development
of
sea
power
and
textbooks
of
an
old
vintage
on
the
sailing
of
ships
and
like
matters
and
if
we
were
to
pry
into
the
drawers
of
an
old
walnut
cabinet
in
the
study
we
should
find
illuminative
data
touching
the
life
of
andrew
kelton
it
is
well
for
us
to
know
that
he
was
born
in
indiana
as
far
as
possible
from
salt
water
and
that
after
being
graduated
from
annapolis
he
served
his
country
until
retired
for
disabilities
due
to
a
wound
received
at
mobile
bay
he
thereafter
became
and
continued
for
fifteen
years
the
professor
of
mathematics
and
astronomy
at
madison
college
in
his
native
state
and
it
is
there
that
we
find
him
living
peacefully
with
his
granddaughter
sylvia
in
the
shadow
of
the
college
comfort
had
set
its
seal
everywhere
but
it
was
keyed
to
male
ideals
of
ease
and
convenience
the
thousand
and
one
things
in
which
women
express
themselves
were
absent
the
eye
was
everywhere
struck
by
the
strict
order
of
the
immaculate
small
rooms
and
the
snugness
with
which
every
article
had
been
fitted
to
its
place
the
professor
broad
desk
was
free
of
litter
his
tobacco
jar
neighbored
his
inkstand
on
a
clean
fresh
blotter
it
is
a
bit
significant
that
sylvia
in
putting
down
her
book
to
answer
the
bell
marked
her
place
carefully
with
an
envelope
for
sylvia
we
may
say
at
once
was
a
young
person
disciplined
to
careful
habits
is
this
professor
kelton
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
him
said
the
young
man
to
whom
she
opened
i
sorry
but
he
is
at
home
replied
sylvia
with
that
directness
which
we
shall
find
characterized
her
speech
the
visitor
was
neither
a
member
of
the
faculty
nor
a
student
and
as
her
grandfather
was
particularly
wary
of
agents
she
was
on
guard
against
the
stranger
it
is
important
for
me
to
see
him
if
he
will
be
back
later
i
can
come
again
the
young
man
did
not
look
like
an
agent
he
carried
no
telltale
insignia
he
was
tall
and
straight
and
decidedly
blond
and
he
smiled
pleasantly
as
he
fanned
himself
with
his
straw
hat
where
his
brown
hair
parted
there
was
a
cowlick
that
flung
an
untamable
bang
upon
his
forehead
giving
him
a
combative
look
that
his
smile
belied
he
was
a
trifle
too
old
for
a
senior
sylvia
reflected
soberly
studying
his
lean
face
but
not
nearly
old
enough
to
be
a
professor
and
except
the
pastor
of
the
church
which
she
attended
and
the
physician
who
had
been
called
to
see
her
in
her
childish
ailments
all
men
in
her
world
were
either
students
or
teachers
the
town
men
were
strange
beings
whom
professor
kelton
darkly
called
philistines
and
their
ways
and
interests
were
beyond
her
comprehension
if
you
will
wait
i
think
i
may
be
able
to
find
him
he
may
have
gone
to
the
library
or
to
the
observatory
or
for
a
walk
wo
you
please
come
in
her
gravity
amused
the
young
man
who
did
not
think
it
so
serious
a
matter
to
gain
an
interview
with
a
retired
professor
in
a
small
college
they
debated
with
much
formality
on
both
sides
whether
sylvia
should
seek
her
grandfather
or
merely
direct
the
visitor
to
places
where
he
would
be
likely
to
find
him
but
as
the
stranger
had
never
seen
professor
kelton
they
concluded
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
sylvia
to
do
the
seeking
she
ushered
the
visitor
into
the
library
where
it
was
cooler
than
on
the
doorstep
and
turned
toward
the
campus
it
is
to
be
noted
that
sylvia
moves
with
the
buoyant
ease
of
youth
she
crosses
the
lane
and
is
on
her
own
ground
now
as
she
follows
the
familiar
walks
that
link
the
college
buildings
together
the
students
who
pass
her
grin
cheerfully
and
tug
at
their
caps
several
from
a
distance
wave
a
hand
at
her
one
young
gentleman
leaning
from
the
upper
window
of
the
chemical
laboratory
calls
hello
sylvia
and
jerks
his
head
out
of
sight
sylvia
chin
lifts
a
trifle
disdainful
of
the
impudence
of
sophomores
she
has
recognized
the
culprit
voice
and
will
deal
with
him
later
in
her
own
fashion
sylvia
is
and
dark
of
eye
and
they
are
interesting
eyes
those
of
sylvia
luminous
and
eager
and
not
fully
taken
in
at
a
glance
they
call
us
back
for
further
parley
by
reason
of
their
grave
and
steady
gaze
there
is
something
appealing
in
her
that
takes
hold
of
the
heart
and
we
remember
her
after
she
has
passed
us
by
we
shall
not
pretend
that
her
features
are
perfect
but
their
trifling
irregularities
contribute
to
an
impression
of
individuality
and
character
her
mouth
for
example
is
a
bit
large
but
it
speaks
for
good
humor
even
at
fifteen
her
lips
suggest
firmness
and
decision
her
forehead
is
high
and
broad
and
her
head
is
well
set
on
straight
shoulders
her
dark
hair
is
combed
back
smoothly
and
braided
and
the
braid
is
doubled
and
tied
with
a
red
ribbon
the
same
color
flashes
in
a
flowing
bow
at
her
throat
these
notes
will
serve
to
identify
sylvia
as
she
crosses
the
campus
of
this
honorable
seat
of
learning
on
a
june
afternoon
this
particular
june
afternoon
fell
somewhat
later
than
the
second
consulship
of
grover
cleveland
and
well
within
the
ensuing
period
of
radicalism
the
hoosiers
with
whom
we
shall
have
to
do
are
not
those
set
forth
by
eggleston
but
the
breed
visible
in
urban
marketplaces
who
submit
themselves
meekly
to
tailors
and
schoolmasters
there
is
always
corn
in
their
egypt
and
no
village
is
so
small
but
it
lifts
a
smokestack
toward
a
sky
that
yields
nothing
to
italy
the
heavens
are
a
soundingboard
devised
for
the
sole
purpose
of
throwing
back
the
mellifluous
voices
of
native
orators
at
the
store
philosophers

upon

the

in
indiana
sylvia
was
three
years
old
when
she
came
to
her
grandfather
this
she
knew
from
the
old
servant
but
where
her
earlier
years
had
been
spent
or
why
or
with
whom
she
did
not
know
and
when
her
grandfather
was
so
kind
and
her
studies
so
absorbing
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
trouble
about
any
state
of
existence
antedating
her
first
clear
recollections
which
were
of
days
punctuated
and
governed
by
the
college
bell
and
of
people
who
either
taught
or
studied
with
glimpses
now
and
then
of
the
women
and
children
of
the
professors
households
there
were
times
when
the
winds
whispered
sharply
round
the
cottage
on
winter
nights
or
when
the
snow
lay
white
on
the
campus
and
in
the
woods
beyond
when
some
memory
taunted
her
teasing
and
luring
afar
off
and
once
as
she
walked
with
her
grandfather
on
a
day
in
march
and
he
pointed
to
a
flock
of
wild
geese
moving
toward
the
kankakee
and
the
far
white
canadian
frontier
she
experienced
a
similar
vague
thrill
of
consciousness
as
though
remembering
that
elsewhere
against
blue
spring
sky
she
had
watched
similar
migrant
battalions
sweeping
into
the
north
she
had
never
known
a
playmate
the
children
of
the
college
circle
went
to
school
in
town
while
she
from
her
sixth
year
was
taught
systematically
by
her
grandfather
the
faithful
oversight
of
mary
the
constituted
sylvia
sole
acquaintance
with
anything
approximating
maternal
care
mary
unknown
to
sylvia
and
professor
kelton
sometimes
took
counsel
the
privilege
of
her
long
residence
in
the
lane
of
some
of
the
professors
wives
who
would
have
been
glad
to
help
directly
but
for
the
increasing
reserve
that
had
latterly
marked
professor
kelton
intercourse
with
his
friends
and
neighbors
sylvia
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
existence
of
social
distinctions
but
in
buckeye
lane
these
were
entirely
negligible
they
were
in
fact
purely
academic
to
be
studied
with
other
interesting
phenomena
by
spectacled
professors
in
quiet
laboratories
it
may
however
be
remarked
that
sylvia
had
sometimes
gazed
not
without
a
twinge
upon
the
daughter
of
a
village
manufacturer
whom
she
espied
flashing
through
the
lane
on
a
black
pony
and
this
young
person
symbolized
all
worldly
grandeur
to
sylvia
adoring
vision
sylvia
knew
the
world
chiefly
from
her
reading
miss
alcott
and
whitney
stories
at
first
and
nicholas
every
month
on
a
certain
day
that
found
her
meeting
the
postman
far
across
the
campus
and
she
had
read
all
the
frank
books
the
prized
possessions
of
a
neighbor
boy
from
the
maine
woods
through
the
gunboat
and
prairie
exploits
of
that
delectable
hero
at
fourteen
she
had
fallen
upon
scott
and
bulwer
and
had
devoured
them
voraciously
during
the
long
vacation
in
shady
corners
of
the
deserted
campus
and
she
was
now
fixing
dickens
characters
ineffaceably
in
her
mind
by
cruikshank
drawings
she
was
well
grounded
in
latin
and
had
a
fair
reading
knowledge
of
french
and
german
it
was
true
of
sylvia
then
and
later
that
poetry
did
not
greatly
interest
her
and
this
had
been
attributed
to
her
undoubted
genius
for
mathematics
she
was
old
for
her
age
people
said
and
the
lane
wondered
what
her
grandfather
meant
to
do
with
her
the
finding
of
professor
kelton
proves
to
be
as
sylvia
had
surmised
a
simple
matter
he
is
at
work
in
a
quiet
alcove
of
the
college
library
a
man
just
entering
sixty
with
white
hair
and
beard
the
eyes
he
raises
to
his
granddaughter
are
like
hers
and
there
is
a
further
resemblance
in
the
dark
skin
his
face
brightens
and
his
eyes
kindle
as
he
clasps
sylvia
slender
supple
hand
it
must
be
a
student
are
you
sure
he
is
a
student
sylvia
was
confident
of
it
very
likely
an
agent
then
they
very
clever
about
disguising
themselves
i
never
see
agents
you
know
sylvia
sylvia
declared
her
belief
that
the
stranger
was
not
an
agent
and
the
professor
glanced
at
his
book
reluctantly
very
well
i
will
see
him
i
wish
you
would
run
down
these
references
for
me
sylvia
do
trouble
about
those
i
have
checked
off
it
be
possible
i
am
following
a
false
clue
i
sure
i
printed
that
article
in
the
science
monthly
for
i
recall
perfectly
that
john
fiske
wrote
me
a
letter
about
it
come
home
when
you
have
finished
and
take
our
usual
walk
together
professor
kelton
had
relinquished
his
chair
in
the
college
when
sylvia
came
to
live
with
him
twelve
years
before
the
beginning
of
this
history
and
had
shut
himself
away
from
the
world
but
no
one
knew
why
sylvia
was
the
child
of
his
only
daughter
of
whom
no
one
ever
spoke
though
the
older
members
of
the
faculty
had
known
her
as
they
had
known
also
the
professor
wife
now
dead
many
years
professor
kelton
had
changed
with
the
coming
of
sylvia
so
his
old
associates
said
and
their
wives
wondered
that
he
should
have
undertaken
the
of
the
child
without
other
aid
than
that
of
the
irishwoman
who
had
cooked
his
meals
and
taken
care
of
the
house
ever
since
kelton
death
he
was
still
a
special
lecturer
at
madison
and
he
derived
some
income
from
the
sale
of
his
textbooks
in
mathematics
which
he
revised
from
time
to
time
to
bring
them
in
touch
with
changing
educational
methods
he
had
given
as
his
reason
for
resigning
a
wish
to
secure
leisure
for
writing
and
he
was
known
to
suffer
severely
at
times
from
the
wounds
that
had
driven
him
from
active
naval
service
but
those
who
knew
him
best
imagined
that
he
bore
in
his
breast
deeper
wounds
than
those
of
war
these
old
friends
of
the
college
circle
wondered
sometimes
at
the
strange
passing
of
his
daughter
and
only
child
who
had
vanished
from
their
sight
as
a
girl
never
to
return
they
were
men
of
quality
these
teachers
who
had
been
identified
with
the
college
so
long
they
and
their
households
were
like
a
large
family
and
when
younger
men
joined
the
faculty
and
inquired
or
when
their
wives
asked
perfectly
natural
questions
about
professor
kelton
and
sylvia
their
inquiries
were
met
by
an
evasion
that
definitely
dismissed
the
matter
and
out
of
this
spirit
which
marked
all
the
social
intercourse
of
the
college
folk
affection
for
professor
kelton
steadily
increased
and
its
light
fell
upon
sylvia
abundantly
there
was
a
particular
smile
for
her
into
which
much
might
be
read
there
was
a
tenderness
manifested
toward
her
which
communicated
itself
to
the
students
who
were
proud
to
win
her
favor
and
were
forever
seeking
little
excuses
for
bandying
words
with
her
when
they
met
the
tradition
of
professor
kelton
scholarship
had
descended
to
sylvia
amusingly
she
had
never
attended
school
but
he
had
taught
her
systematically
at
home
and
his
interests
were
hers
the
students
attributed
to
her
the
most
abstruse
knowledge
and
stories
of
her
precocity
were
repeated
proudly
by
the
lane
folk
many
evenings
spent
with
her
grandfather
at
the
observatory
had
not
been
wasted
she
knew
the
paths
of
the
stars
as
she
knew
the
walks
of
the
campus
wandless
the
president
emeritus
addressed
her
always
as
my
lady
of
the
constellations
and
told
her
solemnly
that
from
much
peering
through
the
telescope
she
had
coaxed
the
stars
into
her
own
eyes
professor
kelton
and
his
granddaughter
were
thus
fully
identified
with
the
college
and
its
business
which
was
to
impart
knowledge
an
but
not
yet
wholly
neglected
function
at
madison
she
reckoned
time
by
semesters
the
campus
had
always
been
her
playground
and
the
excitements
of
her
life
were
those
of
a
small
and
sober
academic
community
the
darkest
tragedies
she
had
known
had
indeed
been
related
to
the
life
of
the
college
the
disciplining
of
the
class
of
for
publishing
itself
in
numerals
on
the
face
of
the
clock
the
recurring
conflicts
between
town
and
gown
that
shook
the
community
every
washington
birthday
the
predatory
habits
of
the
greek
professor
cow
that
botanized
freely
in
alien
gardens
and
occasionally
immured
herself
in
professor
kelton
lettuce
frames
these
and
like
heroic
matters
had
marked
the
high
latitudes
of
sylvia
life
in
the
long
vacations
when
most
of
the
faculty
sought
the
northern
lakes
the
keltons
remained
at
home
and
sylvia
knew
all
the
trees
of
the
campus
and
could
tell
you
just
what
books
she
had
read
under
particular
maples
or
elms
andrew
kelton
was
a
mathematical
scholar
of
high
attainments
in
the
field
of
astronomy
he
had
made
important
discoveries
and
he
carried
on
an
extensive
correspondence
with
observers
of
stellar
phenomena
in
many
far
corners
of
the
world
his
name
in
the
madison
catalogue
was
followed
by
a
bewildering
line
of
cabalistic
letters
testifying
to
the
honor
in
which
other
institutions
of
learning
held
him
wishing
to
devise
for
him
a
title
that
combined
due
recognition
of
both
his
naval
exploits
and
his
fine
scholarship
the
undergraduates
called
him
capordoc
and
it
was
part
of
a
freshman
initiation
to
learn
that
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
he
was
to
stand
and
uncover
when
professor
kelton
passed
by
professor
kelton
occasional
lectures
in
the
college
were
a
feature
of
the
year
and
were
given
in
mills
hall
to
accommodate
the
large
audience
of
students
and
town
folk
that
never
failed
to
assemble
every
winter
to
hear
him
for
into
discourses
on
astronomy
he
threw
an
immense
amount
of
knowledge
of
all
the
sciences
and
once
every
year
though
no
one
ever
knew
when
he
would
be
moved
to
relate
it
he
told
a
thrilling
story
of
how
once
guided
by
the
stars
he
had
run
a
confederate
blockade
in
a
waterlogged
ironclad
under
a
withering
fire
from
the
enemy
batteries
and
when
he
had
finished
and
the
applause
ceased
he
glanced
about
with
an
air
of
surprise
and
said
thank
you
young
gentlemen
it
pleases
me
to
find
you
so
enthusiastic
in
your
pursuit
of
knowledge
learn
the
stars
and
you
wo
get
lost
in
strange
waters
as
we
were
saying
it
was
because
of
still
other
stories
which
he
never
told
or
referred
to
but
which
are
written
in
the
nation
history
that
the
students
loved
him
and
it
was
for
this
that
they
gave
him
at
every
opportunity
their
lustiest
cheer
the
professor
found
the
stranger
sylvia
had
announced
waiting
for
him
at
the
cottage
the
young
man
did
not
mention
his
own
name
but
drew
from
his
pocket
a
sealed
letter
is
this
professor
andrew
kelton
i
am
to
give
you
this
letter
and
wait
for
an
answer
professor
kelton
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
slit
the
envelope
the
letter
covered
only
one
page
and
he
read
slowly
to
the
end
he
then
the
whole
carefully
and
placed
the
sheet
on
his
desk
and
laid
a
weight
upon
it
before
he
faced
the
messenger
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
stroked
his
beard
and
said
speaking
slowly
you
were
to
bring
this
letter
and
bear
back
an
answer
to
the
writer
but
you
were
instructed
not
to
discuss
it
in
any
way
or
disclose
the
name
or
the
residence
of
the
person
who
sent
you
so
much
i
learn
from
the
letter
itself
yes
sir
i
know
nothing
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
i
was
told
to
deliver
it
and
to
carry
back
the
answer
very
good
sir
you
have
fulfilled
your
mission
please
note
carefully
what
i
say
the
reply
is
there
must
be
no
mistake
about
that
do
you
understand
i
am
to
report
that
you
answered
that
is
correct
sir
replied
professor
kelton
quietly
the
young
man
rose
and
the
professor
followed
him
to
the
door
i
thank
you
for
your
trouble
it
has
been
a
warm
day
the
warmest
of
the
season
sir
he
watched
the
young
fellow
prompt
exit
through
the
gate
in
the
hedge
to
the
lane
and
then
returned
to
the
library
where
he
the
letter
now
that
he
was
alone
he
relaxed
somewhat
his
manner
expressed
mingled
trepidation
and
curiosity
the
letter
was
and
was
neither
dated
nor
signed
he
carried
it
to
the
window
and
held
it
against
the
sunlight
but
there
was
not
even
a
watermark
by
which
it
might
be
traced
nor
was
there
anything
in
the
few
straightforward
sentences
that
proved
suggestive
the
letter
ran
your
granddaughter
has
reached
an
age
at
which
her
maintenance
and
education
require
serious
consideration
a
friend
who
can
not
be
known
in
the
matter
wishes
to
provide
a
sum
of
money
to
be
held
and
expended
by
you
for
her
benefit
no
obligations
of
any
sort
will
be
incurred
by
you
in
accepting
this
offer
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
you
will
decline
it
though
it
is
quite
optional
with
you
to
do
so
it
will
not
however
be
repeated
kindly
designate
by
a
verbal
yes
or
no
to
the
bearer
whether
you
accept
or
decline
the
messenger
is
a
stranger
to
the
person
making
the
offer
and
the
contents
of
this
communication
are
unknown
to
him
if
you
wish
to
avail
yourself
of
this
gift
the
amount
will
be
paid
in
cash
immediately
and
it
is
suggested
that
you
refrain
from
mentioning
the
matter
to
your
granddaughter
in
any
way
professor
kelton
had
given
his
answer
to
the
messenger
unhesitatingly
and
the
trouble
reflected
in
his
dark
eyes
was
not
due
we
may
assume
to
any
regret
for
his
negative
reply
but
to
the
jangling
of
old
harsh
chords
of
memory
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
room
lost
in
reverie
then
paused
at
his
desk
and
tore
the
letter
once
across
with
the
evident
intention
of
destroying
it
but
he
hesitated
changed
his
mind
and
carried
it
to
his
bedroom
there
he
took
from
a
closet
shelf
a
battered
tin
box
marked
kelton
which
contained
his
commissions
in
the
navy
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
folded
the
letter
the
long
way
of
the
sheet
and
indorsed
it
in
pencil
declined
then
he
slipped
it
under
the
faded
tape
that
bound
the
official
papers
together
and
locked
and
replaced
the
box
sylvia
meanwhile
had
found
the
review
article
noted
on
her
memorandum
and
leaving
a
receipt
with
the
librarian
started
home
with
the
book
under
her
arm
halfway
across
the
campus
she
met
her
grandfather
caller
hurrying
townward
he
lifted
his
hat
and
sylvia
paused
a
moment
to
ask
if
he
had
found
her
grandfather
yes
thank
you
my
business
did
take
much
time
you
see
i
sorry
i
put
you
to
so
much
bother
oh
that
was
nothing
is
that
new
building
the
college
library
yes
replied
sylvia
are
you
a
madison
man
no
i
was
never
here
before
i
went
to
a
very
different
college
and
he
hesitated
a
little
bigger
one
i
suppose
there
are
bigger
colleges
sylvia
remarked
with
the
slightest
accent
on
the
adjective
the
young
man
laughed
that
the
right
spirit
madison
needs
no
praise
from
me
it
speaks
for
itself
is
this
the
nearest
way
to
the
station
it
had
been
on
sylvia
tongue
to
ask
him
the
name
of
his
college
but
he
had
perhaps
read
this
inquiry
in
her
eyes
and
as
though
suddenly
roused
by
the
remembrance
of
the
secrecy
that
had
been
imposed
upon
him
he
moved
on
yes
i
understand
he
called
over
his
shoulder
thank
you
very
much
he
whistled
softly
to
himself
as
he
continued
on
his
way
still
glancing
about
alertly
the
manner
of
the
old
professor
in
receiving
the
letter
and
the
calmness
with
which
he
had
given
his
reply
minimized
the
importance
of
the
transaction
in
the
mind
of
the
messenger
he
was
thinking
of
sylvia
and
smiling
still
at
her
implication
that
while
there
were
larger
colleges
than
madison
there
was
none
better
he
turned
to
look
again
at
the
college
buildings
closely
clasped
by
their
strip
of
woodland
madison
was
not
a
college
to
sneer
at
he
had
scanned
the
bronze
tablet
on
the
library
wall
that
published
the
roll
of
her
sons
who
had
served
in
the
civil
war
many
of
the
names
were
written
high
in
the
state
history
and
for
a
moment
they
filled
the
young
man
mind
as
she
neared
home
sylvia
met
her
friend
wandless
the
former
president
who
always
had
his
joke
with
her
hail
lady
of
the
constellations
you
have
been
looting
the
library
i
see
hast
thou
named
the
stars
without
a
gun
that
is
right
protested
sylvia
you
purposely
misquoting
you
only
spoiled
emerson
line
about
the
birds
bless
me
i
believe
that
so
laughed
the
old
gentleman
but
tell
me
sylvia
thou
bind
the
sweet
influences
of
pleiades
or
loose
the
bands
of
orion
canst
thou
bring
forth
mazzaroth
in
his
season
or
guide
arcturus
with
his
sons
sylvia
with
brightening
eyes
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
answered
knowest
thou
the
ordinances
of
heaven
canst
thou
set
the
dominion
thereof
in
the
earth
ah
if
only
i
could
sylvia
said
the
old
minister
smiling
gravely
they
came
in
high
spirits
to
the
parting
of
their
ways
and
sylvia
kept
on
through
the
hedge
to
her
grandfather
cottage
the
minister
turned
once
a
venerable
figure
with
snowy
beard
and
hair
and
beat
the
path
softly
with
his
stick
and
glanced
back
as
sylvia
red
ribbon
bobbed
through
the
greenery
daughter
art
thou
he
murmured
gently
then
glancing
furtively
about
he
increased
his
gait
as
though
to
escape
from
his
own
thoughts
but
the
question
asked
of
daughter
by
abraham
servant
came
again
to
his
lips
and
he
shook
his
head
as
he
repeated
whose
daughter
art
thou
chapter
ii
sylvia
goes
visiting
how
old
did
you
say
you
were
sylvia
i
sixteen
in
october
grandpa
answered
sylvia
is
it
possible
murmured
the
professor
and
to
think
that
never
been
to
school
why
i
been
going
to
school
every
day
almost
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
have
i
had
the
finest
teacher
in
the
world
all
to
myself
his
face
brightened
responsive
to
her
laugh
this
was
at
the
for
the
keltons
dined
at
noon
in
conformity
with
local
custom
nearly
a
week
after
the
unsigned
letter
had
been
delivered
to
andrew
kelton
by
the
unknown
messenger
sylvia
and
her
grandfather
had
just
returned
from
a
walk
prolonged
into
the
cool
dusk
they
sat
at
the
square
walnut
table
where
they
had
so
long
faced
each
other
three
times
a
day
sylvia
had
never
doubted
that
their
lives
would
go
on
forever
in
just
this
way
that
they
would
always
be
as
her
grandfather
liked
to
put
it
shipmates
walking
together
studying
together
sitting
as
they
sat
now
at
their
simple
meals
with
just
the
same
quaintly
flowered
dishes
the
same
oddly
turned
teapot
with
its
attendant
cream
pitcher
slightly
cracked
as
to
lip
and
the
with
a
laboring
ship
depicted
in
blue
on
its
curved
side
which
was
not
related
even
by
the
most
remote
cousinship
to
anything
else
in
the
pantry
professor
kelton
was
unwontedly
preoccupied
sylvia
saw
that
he
had
barely
touched
his
strawberries
their
first
of
the
season
though
they
were
fine
ones
and
the
cream
was
the
thickest
she
folded
her
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
watched
him
gravely
in
the
light
of
the
four
candles
whose
flame
flared
in
the
breeze
that
swept
softly
through
the
windows
feeling
her
eyes
upon
him
the
old
gentleman
suddenly
roused
himself
we
had
good
times
have
we
sylvia
and
i
wonder
if
i
have
really
taught
you
anything
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
been
sending
you
to
school
with
the
other
youngsters
about
here
but
the
fact
is
that
i
never
saw
a
time
when
i
wanted
to
part
with
you
you
been
a
fine
little
shipmate
but
you
not
so
little
any
more
sixteen
your
next
birthday
if
that
so
it
is
best
for
us
to
go
on
this
way
you
must
try
your
oar
in
deeper
water
you
outgrown
me
and
i
a
dull
old
fellow
at
best
you
must
go
where
you
will
meet
other
girls
and
deal
with
a
variety
of
teachers
not
just
one
dingy
old
fellow
like
me
have
you
ever
thought
what
kind
of
a
school
you
like
to
go
to
i
do
believe
i
have
i
do
know
much
about
schools
well
do
you
think
you
like
to
get
away
from
so
much
mathematics
and
learn
things
that
will
fit
you
to
be
entertaining
and
amusing
you
know
i
taught
you
a
lot
of
things
just
to
amuse
myself
and
they
can
never
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
you
i
suppose
you
are
the
only
girl
of
your
age
in
america
who
can
read
the
sextant
and
calculate
latitude
and
longitude
but
bless
me
what
the
use
oh
if
i
could
only
only
what
he
encouraged
her
he
was
greatly
interested
in
getting
her
point
of
view
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
a
great
idea
possessed
her
oh
if
i
could
only
go
to
college
that
would
be
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
you
think
that
would
be
more
interesting
than
if
you
go
to
college
they
may
require
greek
and
you
do
even
know
what
the
letters
look
like
oh
yes
i
know
a
little
about
it
i
think
not
sylvia
how
could
you
oh
the
letters
were
so
queer
i
learned
them
just
for
fun
out
of
an
old
textbook
i
found
on
the
campus
one
day
nobody
ever
came
to
claim
it
so
i
read
it
all
through
and
learned
all
the
declensions
and
vocabularies
though
i
only
guessed
at
the
pronunciation
professor
kelton
was
greatly
amused
you
tackled
greek
just
for
fun
did
you
he
laughed
then
after
a
moment
absorption
i
going
to
indianapolis
and
i
take
you
with
me
if
you
care
to
go
along
in
fact
i
written
to
owen
that
we
coming
and
kept
this
as
a
little
surprise
for
you
so
after
an
early
breakfast
the
next
morning
they
were
off
for
the
station
in
one
of
those
disreputable
shaky
village
hacks
that
wandless
always
called
dark
icarian
birds
with
their
two
bags
piled
on
the
seat
before
them
on
the
few
railway
journeys
sylvia
remembered
she
had
been
carried
on
tickets
an
ignominy
which
she
recalled
with
shame
she
was
a
passenger
with
a
seat
to
herself
her
grandfather
being
engaged
through
nearly
the
whole
of
their
hour
swift
journey
in
a
political
discussion
with
a
lawyer
who
was
one
of
the
college
trustees
i
told
owen
not
to
meet
us
it
a
nuisance
having
to
meet
people
said
the
professor
when
they
had
reached
the
city
but
she
always
sends
a
carriage
when
she
expects
me
as
they
stepped
out
upon
the
street
a
station
wagon
driven
by
an
old
negro
appeared
promptly
at
the
curb
mawnin
mawnin
yo
just
on
time
mis
sally
tole
me
to
kerry
you
all
right
up
to
the
haouse
yes
seh
sylvia
did
not
know
what
later
historians
may
be
interested
to
learn
from
these
pages
that
the
station
wagon
drawn
by
a
single
horse
was
for
years
the
commonest
vehicle
known
to
the
people
of
the
hoosier
capital
the
panic
of
had
hit
the
town
so
hard
the
punishment
for
its
sins
of
inflation
had
been
so
drastic
that
it
had
accepted
meekly
the
rebuke
implied
in
its
designation
as
a
town
in
came
another
shock
to
confidence
and
in
still
another
earthquake
as
though
the
knees
of
the
proud
must
at
intervals
be
humbled
the
station
wagon
continued
to
symbolize
the
quiet
domesticity
of
the
citizens
of
the
hoosier
capital
women
of
unimpeachable
social
standing
carried
their
own
baskets
through
the
aisles
of
the
city
market
or
drove
home
with
onion
tops
waving
triumphantly
on
the
seat
beside
them
we
had
not
yet
hitched
our
wagon
to
a
gasoline
tank
but
traffic
regulations
were
enforced
by
cruel
policemen
to
the
terror
of
women
long
given
to
leisurely
manoeuvres
on
the
wrong
side
of
our
busiest
thoroughfares
the
driving
of
cattle
through
washington
street
did
not
cease
until
when
cobbles
yielded
to
asphalt
it
was
in
that
same
year
that
benjamin
harrison
was
chosen
to
the
seat
of
the
presidents
what
hallowed
niches
now
enshrine
the
general
fence
utterly
disintegrated
and
appropriated
during
that
bannered
and
vociferous
summer
by
pious
pilgrims
down
the
busy
meridional
avenue
that
opened
before
sylvia
as
they
drove
uptown
loomed
the
tall
shaft
of
the
soldiers
monument
and
they
were
soon
swinging
round
the
encompassing
plaza
professor
kelton
explained
that
the
monument
filled
a
space
once
called
circle
park
where
the
governor
mansion
had
stood
in
old
times
in
her
hurried
glimpses
sylvia
was
unable
to
account
for
the
lack
of
sociability
among
the
distinguished
gentlemen
posed
in
bronze
around
the
circular
thoroughfare
and
she
thought
it
odd
that
william
henry
harrison
wore
so
much
better
clothes
than
george
rogers
clark
who
was
immortalized
for
her
especial
pleasure
in
the
very
act
of
delivering
the
wabash
from
the
british
yoke
i
wonder
whether
owen
will
like
me
said
sylvia
a
little
plaintively
the
least
bit
homesick
as
they
turned
into
delaware
street
of
course
she
will
like
you
laughed
professor
kelton
though
i
will
say
that
she
does
like
everybody
by
any
manner
of
means
you
be
afraid
of
her
she
gets
on
best
with
people
who
are
not
afraid
to
talk
to
her
she
is
like
anybody
you
ever
saw
or
i
think
anybody
you
are
ever
likely
to
see
again
and
the
professor
chuckled
softly
to
himself
owen
big
comfortable
brick
house
stood
in
that
broad
part
of
delaware
street
where
the
maple
arch
rises
highest
and
it
was
surrounded
by
the
smoothest
of
lawns
broken
only
by
a
stone
basin
in
whose
centre
posed
the
jolliest
of
cupids
holding
a
green
glass
umbrella
over
which
a
jet
of
water
played
in
the
most
realistic
rainstorm
imaginable
another
negro
not
quite
as
venerable
as
the
coachman
opened
the
door
and
took
their
bags
he
explained
that
owen
he
called
her
sally
had
been
obliged
to
attend
a
meeting
of
some
board
or
other
but
would
return
shortly
the
guests
rooms
were
ready
and
he
at
once
led
the
way
upstairs
where
a
white
maid
met
them
professor
kelton
explained
that
he
must
go
down
into
the
city
on
some
errands
but
that
he
would
be
back
shortly
and
sylvia
was
thus
left
to
her
own
devices
it
was
like
a
story
book
to
arrive
at
a
strange
house
and
be
carried
off
to
a
beautiful
room
with
a
from
which
one
could
look
down
into
the
most
charming
of
gardens
she
opened
her
bag
and
disposed
her
few
belongings
and
was
exploring
the
bathroom
wonderingly
for
the
bath
at
home
was
an
affair
of
a
tin
tub
to
which
water
was
carried
by
hand
when
a
maid
appeared
with
a
glass
of
lemonade
and
a
plate
of
cakes
it
was
while
she
munched
her
cakes
and
sipped
the
cool
lemonade
in
the
with
an
elm
branches
so
close
that
she
could
touch
them
and
wondered
how
near
to
this
room
her
grandfather
had
been
lodged
and
what
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
like
that
owen
appeared
after
the
lightest
tap
on
the
high
walnut
door
throughout
her
life
sylvia
will
remember
that
moment
when
she
first
measured
owen
fine
height
and
was
aware
of
her
quick
eager
entrance
but
above
all
else
the
serious
gray
eyes
that
were
so
alive
with
kindness
were
the
chief
item
of
sylvia
inventory
i
thought
you
were
older
or
younger
i
did
know
you
would
be
just
like
this
i
did
know
just
when
you
were
coming
or
i
should
have
tried
to
be
at
home
but
there
was
a
meeting
there
are
so
many
things
child
owen
did
not
sigh
at
the
thought
of
her
burdens
but
smiled
quite
cheerfully
as
though
the
fact
of
the
world
being
a
busy
place
was
wholly
agreeable
she
sat
down
beside
sylvia
in
the
and
took
one
of
the
cakes
and
nibbled
it
while
they
talked
sylvia
had
never
been
so
wholly
at
ease
in
her
life
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
launched
into
the
midst
of
an
old
friendship
and
she
felt
that
she
had
conferred
the
greatest
possible
favor
in
consenting
to
visit
this
house
for
was
not
this
dear
old
lady
saying
you
see
i
lonesome
sometimes
and
i
almost
kidnap
people
to
get
them
to
visit
me
i
a
terribly
practical
old
woman
if
you
have
heard
it
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
a
farmer
and
i
do
let
anybody
run
my
business
other
widows
have
to
take
what
the
lawyers
give
them
but
while
i
can
tell
oats
from
corn
and
horses
from
pigs
i
going
to
handle
my
own
money
we
women
are
a
lot
of
geese
i
tell
you
child
treasurer
of
a
lot
of
things
women
run
and
i
can
see
a
deficit
through
a
brick
wall
as
quick
as
any
man
on
earth
do
you
ever
let
any
man
vote
any
proxy
for
you
you
tell
you
attend
the
meetings
yourself
and
when
you
go
kick
sylvia
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
what
proxy
meant
but
she
was
sure
it
must
be
something
both
interesting
and
important
or
owen
would
not
feel
so
strongly
about
it
when
i
was
your
age
owen
continued
girls
were
allowed
to
learn
anything
but
embroidery
and
housekeeping
but
my
father
had
some
sense
he
was
a
kentucky
farmer
and
raised
horses
and
mules
i
never
knew
anything
about
music
for
i
would
learn
but
i
own
a
stock
farm
near
lexington
and
just
between
ourselves
i
do
lose
any
money
on
it
and
most
that
i
know
about
men
i
learned
from
mules
there
nothing
in
the
world
so
interesting
as
a
mule
when
professor
kelton
had
declared
to
sylvia
on
the
way
from
the
station
that
owen
was
unlike
any
other
woman
in
the
world
sylvia
had
not
thought
very
much
about
it
to
be
sure
sylvia
knowledge
of
the
world
was
the
meagrest
but
certainly
she
could
never
have
imagined
any
woman
as
remarkable
as
owen
the
idea
that
a
mule
instead
of
being
a
dull
beast
of
burden
had
really
an
educational
value
struck
her
as
decidedly
novel
and
she
did
not
know
just
what
to
make
of
it
owen
readjusted
the
pillow
at
her
back
and
went
on
spiritedly
your
grandpa
has
often
spoken
of
you
and
it
mighty
nice
to
have
you
here
you
see
a
good
many
of
us
hoosiers
are
kentucky
people
and
your
grandpa
father
was
i
remember
perfectly
well
when
your
grandpa
went
to
the
naval
academy
and
we
were
all
mighty
proud
of
him
in
the
war
owen
white
hair
was
beautifully
soft
and
wavy
and
she
wore
it
in
the
prevailing
manner
her
eyes
narrowed
occasionally
with
an
effect
of
sudden
dreaminess
and
these
momentary
reveries
seemed
to
the
adoring
sylvia
wholly
fascinating
she
spoke
incisively
and
her
voice
was
deep
and
resonant
she
was
exceedingly
thin
and
wiry
and
her
movements
were
quick
and
nervous
hearing
the
whirr
of
a
in
the
yard
she
drew
a
pair
of
spectacles
from
a
case
she
produced
from
an
incredibly
deep
pocket
put
them
on
and
criticized
the
black
man
below
sharply
for
his
manner
of
running
the
machine
this
done
the
spectacles
went
back
to
the
case
and
the
case
to
the
pocket
in
our
capital
a
woman
in
a
kimono
may
still
admonish
her
servants
from
a
window
without
loss
of
dignity
and
gentlemen
holding
high
place
in
dignified
callings
may
sprinkle
their
own
lawns
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
if
they
find
delight
in
that
cheering
diversion
joy
in
the
simple
life
dies
in
us
slowly
the
galloping
will
run
us
down
eventually
but
on
sundays
that
are
not
too
hot
or
too
cold
one
may
even
count
a
handsome
total
of
bank
balances
represented
in
our
churches
so
strong
is
habit
in
a
people
bred
to
righteousness
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
my
bark
is
worse
than
my
bite
you
have
to
talk
just
that
way
to
these
black
people
they
all
worked
for
me
for
years
and
they
do
any
of
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
what
i
say
but
she
concluded
they
be
a
lot
worse
if
i
did
say
it
we
reckon
time
in
our
capital
not
from
fires
or
floods
or
even
urbis
but
from
seemingly
minor
incidents
that
have
nevertheless
marked
new
eras
and
changed
the
channels
of
history
precedents
sustain
us
in
this
a
startled
goose
rousing
the
sleeping
sentinels
on
the
ramparts
a
dull
peasant
sending
an
army
in
the
wrong
direction
the
mischievous
phrase
uttered
by
an
inconspicuous
minister
of
the
gospel
to
a
few
auditors
such
unconsidered
trifles
play
havoc
with
fame
calculations
and
so
in
our
calendar
the
disbanding
of
the
volunteer
fire
department
in
looms
gloomily
above
the
highest
altitudes
of
the
strenuous
sixties
the
fact
that
billy
sanderson
after
his
father
failure
in
became
a
brakeman
on
the
i
railroad
and
invested
his
first
month
salary
in
a
lantern
is
more
luminous
in
the
retrospect
than
the
panic
itself
the
coming
of
a
lady
with
a
lorgnette
in
the
scion
of
one
of
our
ancient
houses
married
her
in
ohio
overshadows
even
the
passing
of
beecher
church
and
the
sojourn
of
henry
james
in
shattered
all
records
and
established
a
new
orientation
for
our
people
it
was
sally
owen
who
said
when
certain
citizens
declared
that
james
was
inaudible
that
many
heard
him
perfectly
that
night
in
the
propylæum
who
had
always
thought
balzac
the
name
of
a
owen
family
the
singletons
had
crossed
the
ohio
into
hoosier
territory
along
in
the
fifties
in
time
for
sally
to
have
been
a
student
not
the
demurest
from
all
accounts
at
indiana
female
college
where
stood
the
college
the
board
of
trade
has
lately
planted
itself
frowning
down
upon
christ
church
whose
admirable
gothic
spire
chimed
for
union
victories
in
the
sixties
there
a
story
about
that
too
and
still
pleads
with
the
ungodly
on
those
days
of
the
week
appointed
by
the
book
of
common
prayer
for
offices
to
be
said
or
sung
jackson
owen
was
at
this
time
sixty
years
old
and
she
had
been
a
widow
for
thirty
years
the
old
citizens
who
remembered
jackson
owen
always
spoke
of
him
with
a
smile
he
held
an
undisputed
record
of
having
been
defeated
for
more
offices
than
any
other
hoosier
of
his
time
his
chief
assets
when
he
died
were
a
number
of
farms
plastered
with
mortgages
scattered
over
the
commonwealth
in
inaccessible
localities
his
wife
left
a
widow
with
a
daughter
who
died
at
fourteen
addressed
herself
zealously
to
the
task
of
paying
the
indebtedness
with
which
the
lamented
jackson
had
encumbered
his
property
she
had
made
a
point
of
clinging
to
all
the
farms
that
had
been
so
profitless
under
his
direction
and
so
successfully
had
she
managed
them
that
they
were
all
paying
handsomely
a
tract
of
the
tallest
corn
i
ever
saw
was
once
pointed
out
to
me
in
greene
county
and
this
plantation
it
was
explained
had
been
a
worthless
bog
before
owen
tiled
it
and
later
i
saw
stalks
of
this
corn
displayed
in
the
rooms
of
the
agricultural
society
to
illustrate
what
intelligent
farming
can
do
at
the
state
fair
every
fall
it
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
that
owen
such
was
her
business
designation
should
win
more
red
ribbons
than
any
other
exhibitor
either
of
cereals
or
live
stock
there
was
nothing
that
sally
owen
did
not
know
about
feeding
cattle
and
a
paper
she
once
read
before
the
breeders
association
is
a
classic
on
this
important
subject
owen
still
retained
the
active
control
of
her
affairs
though
she
had
gradually
given
over
to
a
superintendent
much
of
the
work
long
done
by
herself
but
woe
unto
him
who
ever
tried
to
deceive
her
she
maintained
an
office
on
the
ground
floor
of
her
house
where
she
transacted
business
and
kept
inventories
of
every
stick
of
wood
every
bushel
of
corn
every
litter
of
pigs
to
which
she
had
ever
been
entitled
for
years
she
had
spent
much
time
at
her
farms
particularly
through
the
open
months
of
the
year
when
farm
tasks
are
most
urgent
but
as
her
indulgence
in
masculine
pursuits
had
not
abated
her
womanly
fastidiousness
she
carried
with
her
in
all
her
journeys
a
negro
woman
whose
business
it
was
to
cook
for
her
mistress
and
otherwise
care
for
her
comfort
she
had
acquired
the
farm
in
kentucky
to
continue
her
ties
with
the
state
of
her
birth
but
this
sentimental
consideration
did
not
deter
her
from
making
the
lexington
farm
pay
sally
owen
made
everything
pay
her
southern
ancestry
was
manifest
in
nothing
more
strikingly
than
in
her
treatment
of
the
blacks
she
had
always
had
about
her
she
called
them
niggers
as
only
a
southerner
may
and
they
called
her
mis
sally
and
were
her
most
devoted
and
obedient
servants
much
of
this
sylvia
was
to
learn
later
but
just
now
as
owen
sat
in
the
cool
it
was
enough
for
sylvia
to
be
there
in
the
company
of
the
first
woman
so
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
ever
known
except
irish
mary
at
home
the
wives
of
the
professors
in
buckeye
lane
were
not
like
this
no
one
was
ever
like
this
she
was
sure
we
shall
be
having
luncheon
at
twelve
and
my
grandniece
marian
will
be
here
marian
is
the
daughter
of
my
niece
morton
bassett
who
lives
at
fraserville
marian
comes
to
town
pretty
often
and
i
asked
her
down
particularly
to
meet
you
i
sure
that
is
very
kind
murmured
sylvia
though
she
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
if
just
she
and
her
grandfather
had
been
left
alone
with
owen
there
the
bell
that
must
be
marian
now
said
owen
a
moment
later
and
vanished
in
her
quick
fashion
then
the
door
opened
again
instantly
and
she
returned
to
the
room
smiling
what
your
name
dear
owen
demanded
how
very
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
asked
before
your
grandpa
in
speaking
of
you
always
says
my
granddaughter
and
that
does
tell
anything
does
it
my
name
is
sylvia
sylvia
garrison
and
that
a
very
nice
name
said
owen
looking
at
her
fixedly
with
her
fine
gray
eyes
you
the
first
sylvia
i
have
ever
known
just
plain
sally
then
she
seized
sylvia
hands
and
drew
her
close
and
kissed
her
as
sylvia
had
brought
but
one
white
gown
she
decided
that
the
blue
serge
skirt
and
linen
in
which
she
had
traveled
would
do
for
luncheon
she
put
on
a
fresh
collar
and
knotted
a
black
scarf
under
it
and
went
downstairs
she
ran
down
quickly
to
have
the
meeting
with
the
strange
niece
over
as
quickly
as
possible
owen
was
not
in
sight
and
her
grandfather
had
not
returned
from
town
but
as
sylvia
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
spacious
she
saw
a
golden
head
bent
over
a
music
rack
by
the
piano
sylvia
stood
on
the
threshold
an
instant
shy
and
uncertain
as
to
how
she
should
make
herself
known
the
sun
flooding
the
windows
glinted
on
the
bright
hair
of
the
girl
at
the
piano
she
was
very
fair
and
her
features
were
and
regular
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
the
crisp
rustle
of
the
leaves
of
music
as
the
girl
tossed
them
about
then
as
she
flung
aside
the
last
sheet
with
an
exclamation
of
disappointment
sylvia
made
herself
known
i
sylvia
garrison
she
said
advancing
they
gravely
inspected
each
other
for
a
moment
then
marian
put
out
her
hand
i
marian
bassett
aunt
sally
told
me
you
were
coming
marian
seated
herself
with
the
greatest
composure
and
sylvia
noted
her
white
lawn
gown
and
white
and
the
bow
of
white
ribbon
at
the
back
of
her
head
sylvia
in
her
blue
serge
black
ribbons
and
high
shoes
felt
the
superiority
of
this
radiant
being
marian
took
charge
of
the
conversation
i
suppose
you
like
to
visit
i
love
it
i
visited
a
lot
and
always
coming
to
aunt
sally
i
in
miss
waring
school
here
in
this
city
so
i
come
to
spend
sundays
with
aunt
sally
very
often
mama
is
always
coming
to
town
to
see
how
i
getting
on
she
terribly
ambitious
for
me
but
i
hate
school
and
i
simply
learn
french
miss
waring
is
terribly
severe
she
says
it
merely
a
lack
of
application
in
my
case
that
i
learn
but
wo
when
mama
comes
she
takes
me
to
luncheon
at
the
whitcomb
and
sometimes
to
the
matinée
we
saw
john
drew
last
winter
he
simply
perfect
so
refined
and
gentlemanly
and
i
seen
julia
marlowe
twice
she
my
favorite
actress
mama
says
that
if
i
just
will
read
novels
i
ought
to
read
good
ones
and
she
gave
me
a
set
of
thackeray
for
my
own
but
you
can
skip
a
whole
lot
in
him
i
here
to
state
one
of
our
best
critics
has
said
mama
always
saying
that
that
the
best
readers
are
those
who
know
how
to
skip
and
i
a
good
skipper
i
always
want
to
know
how
going
to
come
out
if
they
ca
live
happy
forever
afterward
i
want
them
to
part
beautifully
with
soft
music
playing
and
must
go
away
and
leave
holding
a
rose
as
a
pledge
that
will
never
forget
when
marian
paused
there
was
a
silence
as
sylvia
tried
to
pick
out
of
this
long
speech
something
to
which
she
could
respond
marian
was
astonishingly
wise
sylvia
felt
herself
immeasurably
younger
and
she
was
appalled
by
her
own
ignorance
before
this
child
who
had
touched
so
many
sides
of
life
and
who
recounted
her
experiences
so
calmly
and
lightly
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
visited
sylvia
confessed
i
live
with
my
grandfather
kelton
right
by
madison
college
that
at
montgomery
you
know
grandfather
was
a
professor
in
the
college
and
still
lectures
there
sometimes
i
never
been
to
school
how
on
earth
do
you
escape
demanded
marian
it
not
an
escape
laughed
sylvia
you
see
grandfather
being
a
professor
began
teaching
me
almost
before
i
began
remembering
oh
but
even
that
would
be
better
than
a
where
they
make
you
study
it
would
be
easy
to
tell
your
grandfather
that
you
did
want
to
do
things
i
suppose
it
would
sylvia
acknowledged
but
it
so
nice
to
have
him
for
a
teacher
that
i
should
know
just
how
to
do
it
this
point
of
view
did
not
interest
marian
and
she
recurred
to
her
own
affairs
i
been
to
europe
papa
took
us
all
last
year
we
went
to
paris
and
london
it
was
fine
my
grandfather
was
in
the
united
states
navy
before
he
began
teaching
at
madison
so
i
know
a
good
deal
from
him
about
europe
blackford
he
my
brother
is
going
to
annapolis
said
marian
thus
reminded
of
her
brother
aspirations
at
least
he
says
he
is
though
he
used
to
talk
about
west
point
i
hope
he
will
go
into
the
army
i
should
like
to
visit
west
point
it
must
be
perfectly
fascinating
i
suppose
it
is
i
think
i
should
like
college
not
for
me
exclaimed
marian
i
want
to
go
to
a
convent
in
paris
i
know
a
girl
right
here
in
indianapolis
who
did
that
and
it
perfectly
fine
and
ever
so
romantic
to
get
into
college
you
have
to
know
algebra
do
you
yes
i
think
they
require
that
sylvia
replied
on
guard
against
a
display
of
too
much
knowledge
do
you
know
algebra
demanded
marian
sometimes
i
think
i
do
well
there
no
doubt
about
me
i
sure
i
do
it
perfectly
horrid
the
entrance
of
owen
and
the
return
of
professor
kelton
terminated
these
confidences
the
four
were
soon
at
the
luncheon
table
where
the
array
of
crystal
and
silver
seemed
magnificent
to
sylvia
unaccustomed
eyes
she
had
supposed
that
luncheon
meant
some
such
simple
meal
as
the
suppers
she
had
been
used
to
at
home
but
it
included
fried
chicken
and
cold
ham
and
there
were
several
vegetables
and
hot
biscuits
and
hot
corn
bread
and
it
became
necessary
for
sylvia
to
decline
an
endless
succession
of
preserves
and
jellies
for
dessert
there
were
the
most
fragrant
red
raspberries
conceivable
with
golden
sponge
cake
the
colored
man
who
served
the
table
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
immensely
he
condescended
to
make
suggestions
as
he
moved
about
a
little
mo
of
the
cold
ham
or
i
you
like
the
sparrograss
mis
marian
he
murmured
the
bread
extra
fine
mis
to
sylvia
the
hossis
is
awdahed
for
three
mis
sally
to
owen
you
still
have
kentucky
cooking
sally
remarked
professor
kelton
who
had
praised
the
corn
bread
i
do
andrew
replied
the
old
lady
everybody
knows
that
the
best
things
in
indiana
came
through
kentucky
that
includes
you
and
me
prompted
by
owen
friendly
questioning
sylvia
found
herself
talking
she
felt
that
she
was
talking
more
than
marian
but
she
was
much
less
troubled
by
this
than
by
marian
sophisticated
manner
of
lifting
her
asparagus
stalks
with
her
fingers
while
sylvia
resorted
to
the
fork
but
sylvia
comforted
herself
with
the
reflection
that
this
was
all
in
keeping
with
marian
bassett
general
superiority
marian
conducted
herself
with
the
most
mature
air
and
she
made
it
quite
necessary
for
professor
kelton
to
defend
the
navy
against
her
assertion
that
the
army
was
much
more
useful
to
the
country
the
unhurried
meal
passed
and
after
they
had
returned
to
the
marian
left
to
meet
her
mother
at
the
dressmaker
and
return
with
her
to
fraserville
i
hope
to
see
you
again
said
marian
shaking
hands
with
sylvia
i
hope
so
too
sylvia
replied
chapter
iii
a
small
dinner
at
professor
kelton
announced
that
he
had
not
finished
his
errands
in
town
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
the
drive
which
owen
had
planned
very
well
andrew
then
i
shall
take
your
sylvia
for
a
longer
drive
than
i
should
expect
you
to
survive
we
go
out
and
see
how
the
wheat
looks
in
this
new
environment
sylvia
was
aware
that
despite
his
efforts
to
appear
gay
her
grandfather
was
not
himself
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
expected
to
spend
the
afternoon
downtown
and
she
wondered
what
was
troubling
him
the
novelty
of
the
drive
however
quickly
won
her
to
the
best
of
spirits
owen
appeared
ready
for
this
adventure
with
her
tall
figure
wrapped
in
a
linen
duster
her
hat
was
a
practical
affair
of
straw
unadorned
save
by
a
black
ribbon
as
she
drew
on
her
gloves
in
the
the
old
coachman
held
the
heads
of
two
horses
that
were
hitched
to
a
smart
road
wagon
when
her
gloves
had
been
adjusted
owen
surveyed
the
horses
critically
lift
pete
forefoot
the
off
one
joe
she
commanded
stepping
down
into
the
asphalt
court
um
that
just
what
i
thought
that
new
blacksmith
knows
his
business
that
shoe
on
straight
that
other
man
never
did
know
anything
all
right
sylvia
owen
explained
as
the
trim
sorrels
stepped
off
smartly
toward
the
north
that
they
were
estabrook
stock
and
that
she
had
raised
them
herself
on
her
kentucky
farm
which
she
declared
sylvia
must
visit
some
day
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
driving
in
this
way
under
a
high
blue
sky
beside
a
woman
whose
ways
and
interests
were
so
unusual
the
spirited
team
held
owen
attention
but
she
never
allowed
the
conversation
to
flag
several
times
as
they
crossed
car
lines
it
seemed
to
sylvia
that
they
missed
being
struck
only
by
perilously
narrow
margins
when
they
reached
the
creek
they
paused
on
the
bridge
to
allow
the
sorrels
to
rest
and
owen
indicated
with
her
whip
the
line
of
the
new
boulevard
and
recounted
the
history
of
the
region
at
the
state
fair
grounds
owen
drove
in
explaining
that
she
wanted
to
see
what
they
were
doing
to
the
track
sylvia
noticed
that
the
employees
they
passed
grinned
at
owen
as
though
she
were
a
familiar
acquaintance
and
the
superintendent
came
up
and
discussed
horses
and
the
track
changes
with
owen
in
a
strange
vocabulary
he
listened
respectfully
to
what
owen
said
and
was
impressed
sylvia
thought
by
her
opinions
she
referred
to
other
tracks
at
lexington
and
louisville
as
though
they
were
of
course
something
that
everybody
knew
about
the
sun
was
hot
but
owen
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
heat
a
particle
the
superintendent
looked
the
sorrels
over
carefully
they
had
taken
no
end
of
ribbons
at
fairs
and
horse
shows
here
was
a
team
owen
announced
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
show
in
madison
square
garden
against
any
competitors
in
its
class
and
the
superintendent
admitted
that
the
estabrooks
were
a
fine
stock
he
nodded
and
kept
repeating
you
right
or
you
mighty
right
to
everything
the
old
lady
said
it
seemed
to
sylvia
that
nobody
would
be
likely
to
question
or
gainsay
any
opinions
owen
might
advance
on
the
subject
of
horses
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
they
were
driving
back
toward
the
gate
and
saw
the
superintendent
looking
after
them
he
watching
the
team
ai
he
sylvia
i
thought
i
touch
up
his
envy
a
little
that
man
continued
owen
really
knows
a
horse
from
an
elephant
he
been
trying
to
buy
this
team
but
he
has
bid
up
high
enough
yet
it
tickles
me
to
think
that
some
of
those
rich
fellows
down
in
new
york
will
pay
me
a
good
price
when
i
send
down
there
to
the
show
they
need
working
you
ca
do
much
with
horses
in
town
the
asphalt
plays
smash
with
their
feet
there
a
good
stretch
of
pike
out
here
and
i
show
you
what
this
team
can
do
this
promised
demonstration
was
the
least
bit
terrifying
to
sylvia
her
knowledge
of
horses
was
the
slightest
and
in
reading
of
horse
races
she
had
not
imagined
that
there
could
be
such
a
thrill
in
speeding
along
a
stretch
of
good
road
behind
a
pair
of
registered
roadsters
the
flower
of
the
estabrook
stock
driven
by
so
intrepid
and
skillful
a
whip
as
sally
owen
i
guess
that
mile
would
worry
the
boys
some
observed
owen
with
satisfaction
as
she
brought
the
team
to
a
walk
this
was
wholly
cryptic
to
sylvia
but
she
was
glad
that
owen
was
not
disappointed
as
they
loitered
in
a
long
shady
lane
owen
made
it
possible
for
sylvia
to
talk
of
herself
sally
owen
was
a
wise
woman
who
was
considered
a
little
rough
and
peculiar
by
some
of
her
townspeople
chiefly
those
later
comers
who
did
not
understand
the
conditions
of
life
that
had
made
such
a
character
possible
but
none
had
ever
questioned
her
kindness
of
heart
and
in
spite
of
her
frank
direct
way
of
speech
she
was
not
deficient
in
tact
sally
owen
had
an
active
curiosity
but
it
was
of
the
healthy
sort
that
wastes
no
time
on
trifling
matters
she
was
curious
about
sylvia
for
sylvia
was
a
little
different
from
the
young
girls
she
knew
quite
naturally
she
was
comparing
the
slim
girl
at
her
side
with
marian
bassett
marian
was
altogether
obvious
whereas
owen
felt
the
barriers
of
reserve
in
sylvia
sylvia
embodied
questions
in
the
kelton
family
history
that
she
could
not
answer
though
she
had
known
andrew
kelton
all
his
life
and
remembered
dimly
his
only
daughter
who
had
unaccountably
vanished
where
do
you
go
to
school
sylvia
she
asked
i
do
go
to
school
not
to
a
real
school
but
grandfather
teaches
me
he
has
always
taught
me
and
you
are
now
about
how
old
sixteen
in
october
i
been
talking
to
grandfather
about
going
to
college
they
do
send
girls
to
college
nowadays
do
they
we
beginning
to
have
some
of
these
college
women
in
our
town
here
i
know
some
of
let
see
what
they
say
against
colleges
for
women
is
that
the
girls
who
go
there
learn
too
much
so
that
men
are
afraid
to
marry
i
wonder
how
that
is
but
that
in
favor
of
college
i
think
do
you
owen
answered
her
own
question
with
a
laugh
and
having
opened
the
subject
she
went
on
to
disclose
her
opinions
further
i
guess
i
too
old
to
be
one
of
these
new
women
we
hearing
so
much
about
even
farming
got
to
be
a
science
and
it
keeps
me
hustling
to
learn
what
the
new
words
mean
in
the
agricultural
papers
i
belong
to
a
generation
of
women
who
know
how
to
sew
rag
carpets
and
make
quilts
and
stir
soft
soap
in
an
iron
kettle
and
darn
socks
and
i
can
still
cure
a
ham
better
than
any
chicago
factory
does
it
she
added
raking
a
fly
from
the
back
of
the
off
sorrel
with
a
neat
turn
of
the
whip
and
i
reckon
i
make
pay
full
price
for
my
corn
well
well
so
headed
for
college
i
hope
so
said
sylvia
then
after
that
i
going
to
teach
poor
pay
and
hard
work
i
know
lots
of
teachers
they
always
having
nervous
prostration
but
you
look
healthy
oh
i
strong
enough
replied
sylvia
i
think
i
should
like
teaching
marian
was
at
miss
waring
school
last
winter
and
i
could
see
what
she
was
interested
in
much
but
chasing
to
matinées
are
you
crazy
about
theatres
why
i
never
been
to
one
sylvia
confessed
you
just
as
well
off
actors
ai
what
they
used
to
be
when
you
saw
edwin
booth
in
or
jefferson
in
you
saw
acting
i
have
been
in
any
theatre
since
i
saw
jefferson
in
the
the
last
time
he
came
round
there
used
to
be
a
stock
company
at
the
metropolitan
about
that
beat
any
of
these
new
actor
folks
rather
see
a
good
circus
any
time
than
one
of
these
singing
pieces
sassafras
tea
and
a
circus
every
spring
i
always
take
both
sylvia
found
these
views
on
the
drama
wholly
edifying
circuses
and
sassafras
tea
were
within
the
range
of
her
experience
and
finding
that
she
had
struck
a
point
of
contact
owen
expressed
her
pity
for
any
child
that
did
not
enjoy
a
round
of
sassafras
tea
every
spring
sassafras
in
the
spring
and
a
few
doses
of
quinine
in
the
fall
to
eliminate
the
summer
possible
accumulation
of
malaria
were
all
the
medicine
that
any
good
hoosier
needed
owen
averred
i
for
all
this
new
science
you
understand
that
owen
continued
a
good
deal
of
it
does
seem
to
me
mighty
funny
but
when
they
tell
me
to
boil
to
kill
the
bugs
in
it
and
show
me
pictures
of
the
bugs
they
take
with
the
microscope
i
do
snort
just
because
my
grandfather
did
know
about
those
things
and
lived
to
be
and
then
died
from
being
kicked
by
a
colt
i
go
into
the
kitchen
and
i
say
to
eliza
the
water
liza
bile
it
twice
that
the
kind
of
a
new
woman
i
am
but
let
see
we
were
speaking
of
marian
i
liked
her
very
much
she
very
nice
and
ever
so
interesting
said
sylvia
bless
you
she
nice
enough
and
pretty
enough
but
about
this
college
business
i
always
say
that
if
it
ai
in
a
colt
the
trainer
ca
put
it
there
my
niece
that
bassett
marian
mother
wants
marian
to
be
an
intellectual
woman
the
kind
that
reads
papers
on
the
poets
before
literary
clubs
bassett
runs
a
woman
club
in
fraserville
and
she
one
of
the
lights
in
the
federation
they
got
me
up
to
fraserville
to
speak
to
their
club
a
few
years
ago
it
one
of
these
solemn
clubs
women
have
awful
literary
and
never
get
nearer
home
than
doctor
johnson
who
was
nothing
but
a
fat
loafer
anyhow
i
told
they
better
let
me
off
but
they
would
have
it
and
so
i
went
up
and
talked
on
ensilage
it
was
fall
and
i
thought
ensilage
was
seasonable
and
they
ought
to
know
about
it
if
they
did
and
they
did
all
right
sylvia
had
been
staring
straight
ahead
across
the
backs
of
the
team
she
was
conscious
suddenly
that
owen
was
looking
at
her
fixedly
with
mirth
kindling
in
her
shrewd
old
eyes
sylvia
had
no
idea
what
ensilage
was
but
she
knew
it
must
be
something
amusing
or
owen
would
not
have
laughed
so
heartily
it
was
a
good
joke
was
it
talking
to
a
literary
club
about
silos
i
told
i
come
back
and
read
my
little
piece
on
feeding
but
they
have
called
me
yet
they
had
driven
across
to
meridian
street
and
owen
sent
the
horses
into
town
at
a
comfortable
trot
they
traversed
the
new
residential
area
characterized
by
larger
grounds
and
a
higher
average
of
architecture
that
edward
thatcher
new
house
the
biggest
one
they
say
easier
to
pay
for
a
castle
like
that
out
here
than
it
is
to
keep
a
cook
so
far
away
from
washington
street
i
let
go
of
ten
acres
right
here
in
the
eighties
we
used
to
think
the
town
would
stop
at
the
creek
owen
explained
and
then
announced
the
dictum
keep
land
mortgage
if
you
got
to
but
never
sell
that
my
motto
it
was
nearly
six
when
they
reached
home
and
dinner
was
appointed
for
seven
owen
drove
directly
into
the
barn
and
gave
minute
instructions
as
to
the
and
feeding
of
the
horses
in
addressing
the
negroes
she
imitated
their
own
manner
of
speech
sylvia
had
noticed
that
owen
did
not
always
pronounce
words
in
the
same
way
but
such
variations
are
marked
among
our
southwestern
people
particularly
where
as
in
owen
case
they
have
lived
on
both
sides
of
the
ohio
river
sometimes
she
said
hoss
unmistakably
and
here
and
again
when
she
said
bile
for
boil
it
was
obviously
with
humorous
intention
except
in
long
speeches
she
did
not
drawl
at
times
she
spoke
rapidly
snapping
off
sentences
abruptly
her
fashion
of
referring
to
herself
in
the
third
person
struck
sylvia
as
most
amusing
look
here
you
joe
it
a
nice
way
to
treat
yo
mis
sally
turning
out
that
wagon
with
the
dash
all
scratched
don
you
think
i
blind
and
ca
tell
when
you
boys
dig
a
broom
into
a
varnished
buggy
next
time
i
catch
yo
doing
that
i
send
you
down
to
greene
county
to
plow
and
yo
not
go
to
any
more
fancy
hoss
shows
with
me
as
she
followed
owen
into
the
house
sylvia
thought
she
heard
suppressed
guffawing
in
the
stable
owen
must
have
heard
it
too
a
worthless
lot
she
muttered
i
going
to
clean
all
out
some
day
and
try
the
irish
but
sally
owen
had
often
made
this
threat
without
having
the
slightest
intention
of
carrying
it
into
effect
professor
kelton
had
just
reached
the
house
and
he
seemed
so
hot
and
tired
that
sylvia
was
struck
with
pity
for
him
he
insisted
however
that
he
was
perfectly
well
but
admitted
that
his
errands
had
proved
to
be
more
vexatious
than
he
had
expected
what
kind
of
a
time
have
you
been
having
he
asked
as
they
went
upstairs
together
oh
the
finest
in
the
world
i
sure
i
learned
a
lot
a
great
many
things
i
never
dreamed
about
before
horses
i
never
knew
before
that
there
was
anything
to
know
about
horses
but
owen
knows
all
about
them
and
that
team
we
drove
behind
is
wonderful
they
move
together
perfectly
and
go
like
lightning
when
you
want
them
to
well
i
glad
you
enjoyed
yourself
you
better
put
on
your
white
dress
you
brought
one
did
you
there
will
be
company
at
dinner
do
you
scare
that
child
about
company
andrew
said
owen
coming
up
behind
them
with
the
linen
duster
flung
over
her
arm
if
you
have
any
white
dress
sylvia
that
blue
one
perfectly
good
and
proper
she
followed
sylvia
to
her
room
continuing
to
reassure
her
she
even
shook
out
the
gown
exclaiming
well
well
sylvia
did
know
why
and
went
out
abruptly
instructing
sylvia
to
ring
for
the
maid
if
she
needed
help
there
were
three
other
guests
for
dinner
and
they
were
unlike
any
other
people
that
sylvia
had
known
she
was
introduced
first
to
admiral
martin
a
retired
officer
of
the
navy
who
having
remained
in
the
service
of
his
country
to
the
retiring
age
had
just
come
home
to
live
in
the
capital
of
his
native
state
he
was
short
and
thick
and
talked
in
a
deep
growling
voice
exactly
as
admirals
should
the
suns
and
winds
of
many
seas
had
burned
and
scored
his
face
and
a
stubby
mustache
gave
him
a
belligerent
aspect
he
mopped
his
brow
with
a
tremendous
handkerchief
and
when
owen
introduced
sylvia
as
professor
kelton
granddaughter
he
glared
fiercely
well
i
declare
andy
your
granddaughter
well
i
declare
he
held
sylvia
hand
a
moment
and
peered
into
her
face
i
remember
your
mother
very
well
andy
i
recall
distinctly
that
you
and
your
wife
were
at
old
point
in
about
the
winter
of
and
your
daughter
was
with
you
so
this
is
your
granddaughter
well
i
declare
i
wish
she
was
mine
i
glad
to
see
you
sylvia
said
martin
a
shy
little
woman
i
remember
that
winter
at
old
point
i
was
waiting
for
my
husband
there
you
look
like
your
mother
it
really
a
very
striking
resemblance
we
were
all
so
fond
of
edna
this
was
the
first
time
that
any
one
except
her
grandfather
had
ever
spoken
to
sylvia
of
her
mother
and
the
words
of
these
strangers
thrilled
her
strangely
and
caused
the
tears
to
shine
suddenly
in
her
eyes
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
for
martin
seeing
trembling
lips
changed
the
subject
quickly
the
last
guest
was
just
entering
a
tall
man
who
crossed
the
room
to
owen
with
a
long
curious
stride
he
had
shaken
hands
with
professor
kelton
and
owen
introduced
him
to
the
martins
who
by
reason
of
their
long
absences
had
never
met
him
before
ware
this
is
sylvia
garrison
said
owen
sylvia
was
given
then
as
later
to
quick
appraisements
and
she
liked
the
reverend
john
ware
on
the
instant
he
did
not
look
or
act
or
talk
in
the
least
like
a
minister
he
was
very
dark
and
his
mustache
was
only
faintly
sprinkled
with
gray
his
hair
still
showed
black
at
a
distance
though
he
was
he
had
been
sometime
earlier
the
pastor
of
the
first
congregational
church
but
after
a
sojourn
in
other
fields
had
retired
to
live
among
his
old
parishioners
in
the
city
which
had
loved
him
best
it
had
been
said
of
him
in
the
days
of
his
pastorate
that
he
drew
the
largest
congregations
and
the
smallest
collections
of
any
preacher
the
community
had
ever
known
but
ware
was
curiously
unmindful
of
criticism
he
had
fished
and
hunted
he
had
preached
charity
and
kindness
and
when
there
was
an
unknown
tramp
to
bury
or
some
unfortunate
girl
had
yielded
to
despair
he
had
officiated
at
the
funeral
and
if
need
be
ridden
to
the
cemetery
on
the
hearse
i
owen
neighbor
you
know
he
explained
to
sylvia
my
family
have
gone
for
the
summer
i
hanging
on
here
till
my
indian
sends
me
a
postal
that
the
fishing
is
right
on
the
nipigon
nothing
like
getting
off
the
train
somewhere
and
being
met
by
an
indian
with
a
paddle
on
his
shoulder
you
can
learn
a
lot
from
an
indian
there
were
candles
and
flowers
on
the
round
table
and
the
dishes
and
silver
were
owen
company
best
which
was
very
good
indeed
the
admiral
and
professor
kelton
sat
at
owen
right
and
left
and
sylvia
found
herself
between
the
minister
and
the
admiral
the
talk
was
at
once
brisk
and
general
the
admiral
voice
boomed
out
tremendously
and
when
he
laughed
the
glasses
jingled
every
one
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
sylvia
was
relieved
to
find
that
her
grandfather
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
the
admiral
jokes
harked
back
to
old
times
when
he
and
kelton
were
at
the
naval
academy
or
to
their
adventures
in
the
war
it
was
odd
to
hear
owen
and
the
admiral
calling
her
grandfather
andrew
and
andy
no
one
else
had
ever
done
that
and
both
men
addressed
owen
as
sally
at
a
moment
when
sylvia
had
begun
to
feel
the
least
bit
awkward
at
being
the
only
silent
member
of
the
company
the
minister
spoke
to
her
he
had
seemed
at
first
glance
a
stoical
person
but
his
brown
eyes
were
bright
with
good
humor
these
old
sea
dogs
made
a
lot
of
history
i
suppose
you
know
a
good
deal
about
the
sea
from
your
grandfather
yes
but
i
never
seen
the
sea
i
crossed
it
once
or
twice
and
tramped
england
and
scotland
i
wanted
to
see
burns
country
and
the
house
at
chelsea
where
carlyle
smoked
his
pipe
but
i
like
our
home
folks
best
ware
growled
the
admiral
a
man
told
me
the
other
day
that
served
in
the
army
i
wish
i
had
a
chaplain
like
you
in
the
navy
i
might
have
been
a
different
man
owen
glanced
at
ware
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
afraid
i
going
to
be
discovered
he
remarked
to
sylvia
as
he
buttered
a
bit
of
bread
well
what
part
of
the
army
did
you
serve
in
demanded
the
admiral
captain
fifth
new
york
cavalry
replied
the
minister
quietly
shrugging
his
shoulders
captain
you
were
a
fighting
man
the
admiral
boomed
sort
of
one
we
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
one
way
or
another
four
years
of
it
did
begin
fighting
the
devil
till
afterward
how
are
things
at
the
college
doctor
kelton
ware
thus
characteristically
turned
the
conversation
from
himself
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
care
to
discuss
his
military
experiences
in
a
moment
they
were
talking
politics
in
which
he
seemed
greatly
interested
we
kept
bosses
out
of
this
state
pretty
well
professor
kelton
was
saying
but
i
can
see
one
or
two
gentlemen
on
both
sides
of
the
fence
trying
to
play
that
game
i
do
believe
the
people
of
indiana
will
submit
to
it
the
bosses
need
big
cities
to
prey
on
and
we
are
big
enough
for
them
to
work
in
and
hide
in
we
all
live
in
the
open
and
we
mostly
seasoned
american
stock
who
wo
be
driven
like
a
lot
of
foreign
cattle
this
city
is
a
country
town
any
longer
but
still
american
i
do
know
of
any
boss
here
well
sally
how
about
mort
bassett
asked
the
admiral
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
speaking
of
him
not
in
the
slightest
owen
replied
the
fact
that
morton
bassett
married
my
niece
does
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
approve
of
all
he
does
and
i
do
when
i
get
a
chance
i
give
him
the
best
licks
i
can
he
a
democrat
but
i
not
neither
am
i
a
republican
they
all
just
as
crooked
as
a
dog
hind
leg
i
gave
up
when
they
beat
tilden
out
of
the
presidency
why
if
i
been
samuel
tilden
i
have
moved
into
the
white
house
and
dared
to
throw
me
out
the
democratic
party
never
did
have
any
gumption
she
concluded
vigorously
a
sound
idea
sally
grumbled
the
admiral
but
it
not
new
bassett
is
a
bad
fellow
remarked
ware
you
can
hardly
call
him
a
boss
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
personally
he
certainly
very
agreeable
said
martin
you
remember
owen
i
visited
your
niece
the
last
time
i
was
home
and
i
never
saw
a
man
more
devoted
to
his
family
than
mr
bassett
there
no
complaint
about
that
owen
assented
and
morton
a
very
intelligent
man
too
you
might
even
call
him
a
student
i
been
sorry
that
he
did
keep
to
the
law
but
he
a
moneymaker
and
he
in
politics
as
a
part
of
his
business
i
wondered
said
professor
kelton
just
what
he
aiming
at
most
of
these
men
are
ambitious
to
go
high
he
a
state
senator
but
not
much
in
that
he
must
see
bigger
game
in
the
future
i
do
know
him
myself
but
from
what
you
hear
of
him
he
must
be
a
man
of
force
weak
men
do
dominate
political
parties
this
political
game
looks
mighty
queer
to
me
the
admiral
remarked
i
never
voted
in
my
life
but
i
guess
i
try
it
now
they
put
me
on
the
shelf
do
you
vote
mr
ware
oh
yes
i
one
of
these
sentimentalists
who
tries
to
vote
for
the
best
man
naturally
no
man
i
ever
vote
for
is
elected
if
i
voted
i
should
want
to
see
the
man
first
owen
averred
i
should
ask
him
how
much
he
expected
to
make
out
of
the
job
you
be
a
tartar
in
politics
sally
said
the
admiral
the
governor
told
me
the
other
day
that
when
he
hears
that
you
coming
to
the
state
house
to
talk
about
the
woman
reformatory
or
whatever
it
is
trustee
of
he
crawls
under
the
table
he
says
they
were
going
to
cut
down
the
reformatory
appropriation
last
winter
but
that
you
went
to
the
legislature
and
gave
an
example
of
lobbying
that
made
the
tough
old
railroad
campaigners
green
with
envy
i
reckon
i
did
i
told
the
members
of
that
committee
that
if
they
cut
that
appropriation
i
go
into
their
counties
and
spend
every
cent
got
fighting
if
they
ever
ran
for
office
again
joshua
fill
the
glasses
sylvia
was
anxious
to
know
the
rest
of
the
story
i
hope
they
gave
you
the
money
owen
she
said
did
they
give
it
to
me
why
child
they
raised
it
twenty
thousand
dollars
i
had
to
hold
down
then
morton
bassett
pulled
it
through
the
senate
for
me
i
told
him
if
he
did
i
cut
his
acquaintance
there
ed
thatcher
too
if
we
restricted
to
the
democratic
camp
the
minister
was
saying
thatcher
has
a
fortune
to
use
if
he
ever
wants
to
try
for
something
big
in
politics
which
does
seem
likely
he
has
a
family
that
can
spend
his
money
said
martin
what
would
he
want
with
an
office
anyway
the
governorship
would
bore
him
to
death
it
might
tickle
him
to
go
to
the
senate
particularly
if
he
had
a
score
to
clean
up
in
connection
with
it
remarked
ware
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
the
admiral
well
ware
replied
he
and
bassett
are
as
thick
as
thieves
just
now
in
business
operations
if
some
day
it
came
about
that
they
did
get
on
so
well
if
bassett
tried
to
drop
him
as
they
say
he
has
sometimes
dropped
men
when
he
did
have
any
more
use
for
them
then
sporting
blood
might
assert
itself
i
should
be
sorry
for
bassett
if
that
time
came
edward
thatcher
knows
a
horse
interposed
owen
i
like
edward
thatcher
i
fished
with
bassett
said
the
minister
a
good
fisherman
ought
to
make
a
good
politician
there
a
lot
i
guess
in
knowing
just
how
to
bait
the
hook
or
where
to
drop
the
fly
and
how
to
play
your
fish
and
bassett
is
a
man
of
surprising
tastes
he
a
book
collector
rare
editions
and
fine
bindings
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
it
possible
the
newspapers
that
abuse
him
never
mention
those
things
of
course
said
martin
a
brief
restraint
fell
upon
the
company
as
they
realized
suddenly
that
they
were
discussing
the
husband
of
their
hostess
niece
whom
the
opposition
press
declared
to
be
the
most
vicious
character
that
had
ever
appeared
in
the
public
life
of
the
state
the
minister
had
spoken
well
of
him
the
others
did
not
know
him
or
spoke
cautiously
and
owen
herself
seemed
during
ware
last
speech
to
be
a
trifle
restless
she
addressed
some
irrelevant
remark
to
the
admiral
as
they
rose
and
adjourned
to
the
long
side
veranda
where
the
men
lighted
cigars
i
think
i
like
this
corner
best
remarked
ware
when
the
others
had
disposed
themselves
miss
sylvia
wo
you
sit
by
me
she
watched
his
face
as
the
match
flamed
to
his
cigar
it
was
and
rugged
with
high
cheek
bones
that
showed
plainly
when
he
shut
his
jaws
it
occurred
to
sylvia
that
but
for
his
mustache
his
face
would
have
been
almost
typically
indian
she
had
seen
somewhere
a
photograph
of
a
sioux
chief
whose
austere
countenance
was
very
like
the
minister
ware
did
not
fit
into
any
of
her
preconceived
ideas
of
the
clerical
office
wandless
the
retired
president
of
madison
college
was
a
minister
and
any
one
would
have
known
it
for
the
fact
was
proclaimed
by
his
dress
and
manner
he
might
in
the
most
casual
meeting
on
the
campus
have
raised
his
hands
in
benediction
without
doing
anything
at
all
extraordinary
ware
belonged
to
a
strikingly
different
order
and
sylvia
did
not
understand
him
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
sylvia
could
not
imagine
wandless
in
a
cavalry
charge
ware
flung
the
away
and
settled
himself
comfortably
into
his
chair
the
others
were
talking
amongst
themselves
of
old
times
and
sylvia
experienced
a
sense
of
ease
and
security
in
the
minister
company
those
people
across
there
are
talking
of
the
hoosiers
that
used
to
be
and
about
the
good
folks
who
came
into
the
wilderness
and
made
indiana
a
commonwealth
i
a
pilgrim
and
a
stranger
comparatively
speaking
not
a
hoosier
are
you
no
ware
i
was
born
in
new
york
city
ho
i
might
have
known
there
was
some
sort
of
tie
between
us
i
was
born
in
new
york
myself
up
in
the
adirondack
country
you
heard
of
old
john
brown
my
father
farm
was
only
an
hour
march
from
brown
place
i
used
to
see
the
old
man
and
it
was
my
fault
i
was
mixed
up
in
some
of
his
scrapes
father
caught
me
and
took
me
home
did
see
any
reason
why
i
should
go
off
and
get
killed
with
a
crazy
man
did
know
brown
was
going
to
be
immortal
there
must
have
been
a
good
many
people
that
did
know
it
sylvia
responded
she
hoped
that
ware
would
talk
of
himself
and
of
the
war
but
in
a
moment
his
thoughts
took
a
new
direction
stars
are
fine
it
a
comfort
to
know
they
up
there
all
the
time
know
matthew
arnold
poems
he
says
joy
the
stars
perform
their
shining
i
like
that
when
i
off
camping
the
best
fun
of
it
is
lying
by
running
water
at
night
and
looking
at
the
stars
odd
though
i
never
knew
the
names
of
many
of
them
would
know
any
if
it
were
for
the
dippers
not
sure
of
them
as
it
is
there
the
north
star
over
there
suppose
your
grandfather
knows
all
i
think
he
does
replied
sylvia
he
still
lectures
about
them
sometimes
wonder
what
that
is
just
across
the
farthest
tip
of
that
maple
familiar
but
i
ca
name
it
that
said
sylvia
is
cassiopeia
so
how
many
constellations
do
you
know
sylvia
was
silent
a
moment
she
was
not
sure
that
it
was
polite
to
disclose
her
knowledge
of
the
subject
to
a
man
who
had
just
confessed
his
ignorance
she
decided
that
anything
beyond
the
most
modest
admission
would
be
unbecoming
i
know
several
or
i
think
i
do
this
is
june
that
the
north
star
over
the
point
of
that
tree
as
you
said
and
above
it
is
ursa
minor
and
winding
in
and
out
between
it
and
the
big
dipper
is
draco
then
to
the
east
higher
up
are
cygnus
lyra
and
aquila
and
in
the
west
she
paused
feeling
that
she
had
satisfied
the
amenities
of
conversation
with
this
gentleman
who
had
so
frankly
stated
his
lack
of
knowledge
ware
struck
his
knee
with
his
hand
and
chuckled
i
should
say
you
do
know
a
few
you
mentioned
some
i
always
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
now
go
back
to
cygnus
the
swan
i
like
the
name
of
that
one
i
must
be
sure
to
remember
it
politeness
certainly
demanded
that
sylvia
should
answer
and
now
that
the
minister
plied
her
with
questions
her
own
interest
was
aroused
and
she
led
him
back
and
forth
across
the
starry
lanes
describing
in
the
most
artless
fashion
her
own
method
of
remembering
the
names
and
positions
of
the
constellations
as
their
range
of
vision
on
the
veranda
was
circumscribed
ware
suggested
that
they
step
down
upon
the
lawn
to
get
a
wider
sweep
a
move
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
others
sylvia
be
careful
of
the
wet
josephus
just
moved
the
sprinkler
and
that
ground
is
soaked
do
call
attention
to
our
feet
our
heads
are
in
the
stars
answered
ware
i
must
tell
the
indian
boys
on
the
nipigon
about
this
he
said
to
sylvia
as
they
returned
to
the
veranda
i
did
know
anybody
knew
as
much
as
you
do
you
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
you
need
be
laughed
sylvia
very
likely
most
that
i
told
you
is
wrong
i
glad
grandfather
did
hear
me
the
admiral
and
professor
kelton
were
launched
upon
a
fresh
exchange
of
reminiscences
and
the
return
of
ware
and
sylvia
did
not
disturb
them
it
seemed
however
that
ware
was
a
famous
and
when
he
had
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
he
recounted
a
number
of
adventures
speaking
in
his
habitual
dry
tone
and
with
curious
unexpected
turns
of
phrase
conversation
in
indiana
seems
to
drift
into
inevitably
john
ware
once
read
a
paper
before
the
indianapolis
literary
club
to
prove
that
this
hoosier
trait
was
derived
from
the
south
he
drew
a
species
of
ellipsoid
of
which
the
ohio
river
was
the
axis
sketching
his
line
to
include
the
missouri
of
mark
twain
the
illinois
of
lincoln
the
indiana
of
eggleston
and
riley
and
the
kentucky
that
so
generously
endowed
these
younger
commonwealths
north
of
the
ohio
the
anecdotal
genius
diminished
he
declared
as
one
moved
toward
the
great
lakes
into
a
region
where
there
had
been
an
infusion
of
population
from
new
england
and
the
middle
states
he
suggested
that
the
early
pioneers
having
few
books
and
no
newspapers
had
cultivated
the
art
of
for
their
own
entertainment
and
that
the
soldiers
returning
from
the
civil
war
had
developed
it
further
having
made
this
note
of
his
thesis
i
hasten
to
run
away
from
it
let
others
prone
to
interminable
debate
tear
it
to
pieces
if
they
must
this
kind
of
social
intercourse
with
its
intimate
talk
the
references
to
famous
public
characters
as
though
they
were
only
human
beings
after
all
the
anecdotal
interchange
was
wholly
novel
to
sylvia
she
thought
stories
much
droller
than
the
admiral
and
quite
as
good
as
her
grandfather
which
was
a
great
concession
the
minister
was
beginning
a
new
story
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
and
threw
out
his
arms
with
one
of
his
odd
jerky
gestures
there
a
good
deal
of
fun
in
living
in
the
woods
up
in
the
adirondacks
there
was
a
lot
for
the
boys
to
do
when
i
was
a
youngster
i
liked
winter
better
than
summer
school
was
in
winter
but
when
you
had
the
fun
of
fighting
big
drifts
to
get
to
it
you
did
mind
getting
licked
after
you
got
there
the
silence
of
night
in
the
woods
when
the
snow
is
deep
the
wind
still
and
the
moon
at
full
is
the
solemnest
thing
in
the
world
not
really
of
this
world
i
guess
sometimes
you
can
hear
a
bough
break
under
the
weight
of
snow
with
a
report
like
a
cannon
the
only
thing
finer
than
winter
is
spring
i
do
mean
lilac
time
but
before
that
the
very
earliest
hint
of
the
used
to
seem
that
there
was
something
wild
in
me
that
wanted
to
be
on
the
march
before
there
was
a
bud
in
sight
i
a
northern
animal
some
way
born
in
december
always
feel
better
in
winter
i
used
to
watch
for
the
northward
flight
of
the
game
fowl
wanted
to
go
with
the
birds
too
bad
they
killing
them
all
off
wild
geese
are
getting
mighty
scarce
geese
always
interested
me
i
once
shot
a
gander
in
a
kankakee
marsh
that
had
an
eskimo
arrow
in
its
breast
a
friend
of
mine
distinguished
ethnologist
verified
that
said
he
knew
the
tribe
that
made
arrows
of
that
pattern
but
i
was
going
to
say
that
one
night
must
have
been
when
i
was
fourteen
i
had
some
fun
with
a
bear
sylvia
did
not
hear
the
rest
of
the
story
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
with
her
lips
apart
listening
wondering
during
this
prelude
ware
references
to
the
north
woods
had
touched
lightly
some
dim
memory
of
her
own
somewhere
she
had
seen
snowy
woodlands
where
silence
lay
upon
the
world
as
soft
as
moonlight
itself
the
picture
drawn
by
the
minister
had
been
vivid
enough
for
a
moment
her
own
memory
of
a
similar
winter
landscape
seemed
equally
clear
but
she
realized
with
impatience
that
it
faded
quickly
and
became
dim
and
illusory
like
a
scene
in
an
steropticon
she
felt
that
a
barrier
lay
between
her
and
those
years
of
her
life
that
antedated
her
coming
to
her
grandfather
house
by
the
college
it
troubled
her
as
such
mirages
of
memory
trouble
all
of
us
but
ware
finished
his
story
and
amid
the
laughter
that
followed
martin
rose
late
hours
sylvia
said
professor
kelton
when
they
were
alone
nearly
eleven
and
time
to
turn
in
chapter
iv
we
learn
more
of
sylvia
andrew
kelton
put
out
his
hand
to
say
a
moment
after
sylvia
had
vanished
sit
down
andrew
said
owen
it
too
early
to
go
to
bed
that
draft
not
good
for
the
back
of
your
head
sit
over
here
he
had
relaxed
after
the
departure
of
the
dinner
guests
and
looked
tired
and
discouraged
owen
brought
a
bottle
of
whiskey
and
a
pitcher
of
water
and
placed
them
near
his
elbow
try
it
andrew
i
usually
take
a
thimbleful
myself
before
going
to
bed
the
novelty
of
this
sort
of
ministration
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
lift
a
weary
and
discouraged
spirit
owen
measured
his
whiskey
and
poured
it
into
a
tall
glass
explaining
as
she
did
so
that
a
friend
of
hers
in
louisville
kept
her
supplied
out
of
the
stores
of
the
pendennis
club
it
off
the
wood
this
bottled
whiskey
is
poison
i
just
as
lief
take
paregoric
i
drew
this
from
my
own
this
morning
do
imagine
i
a
heavy
consumer
a
lasts
me
a
long
time
i
divide
it
around
among
my
friends
remind
me
to
give
you
some
to
take
home
try
one
of
those
cigars
john
ware
keeps
a
box
here
if
cabbage
leaf
it
is
my
fault
no
thanks
sally
you
altogether
too
kind
to
me
it
mighty
good
to
be
here
i
can
tell
you
now
that
you
are
here
andrew
i
want
you
to
remember
that
i
getting
on
and
you
just
a
trifle
ahead
of
me
on
the
dusty
pike
that
has
no
turning
i
wish
i
had
your
eternal
youth
sally
i
feel
about
that
the
reason
i
keeping
you
up
you
came
here
to
talk
about
something
that
on
your
mind
and
the
sooner
it
over
the
better
no
use
in
your
lying
awake
all
night
professor
kelton
played
with
his
glass
and
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
come
right
out
with
it
andrew
if
it
money
that
worries
you
waste
any
time
explaining
how
it
happened
just
tell
me
how
much
i
had
my
bank
book
balanced
yesterday
and
i
got
exactly
twelve
thousand
four
hundred
and
eighteen
dollars
and
eleven
cents
down
at
tom
bank
if
you
can
use
it
you
welcome
if
it
ai
enough
i
about
to
sell
a
bunch
o
colts
i
got
on
my
lexington
place
and
they
good
for
six
thousand
more
i
can
close
the
trade
by
a
night
telegram
right
now
kelton
laughed
the
sums
she
named
so
lightly
represented
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
it
afforded
him
infinite
relief
to
be
able
to
talk
to
her
and
though
he
had
come
to
the
city
for
the
purpose
his
adventures
of
the
day
with
banks
and
trust
companies
had
given
a
new
direction
to
his
needs
but
the
habit
of
secrecy
of
fighting
out
his
battles
alone
was
so
thoroughly
established
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
enter
into
confidences
even
when
this
friend
made
the
way
easy
for
him
come
out
with
it
andrew
you
the
only
person
i
know
who
never
come
to
me
with
troubles
i
begun
to
think
you
were
among
the
lucky
ones
who
never
have
any
or
else
you
were
afraid
of
me
it
not
fair
to
trouble
you
about
this
but
i
in
a
corner
where
i
need
help
when
i
asked
you
to
let
me
bring
sylvia
here
i
merely
wanted
you
to
look
her
over
she
got
to
an
age
where
i
ca
trust
my
judgment
about
her
i
had
a
plan
for
her
that
i
thought
i
could
put
through
without
much
trouble
but
i
found
out
that
it
is
so
easy
i
wanted
to
send
her
to
college
you
want
to
send
her
to
college
and
you
thought
you
would
come
over
and
let
me
give
her
a
little
motherly
counsel
while
you
borrowed
the
money
of
tom
adams
to
pay
her
college
bills
is
that
what
happened
just
about
that
sally
adams
is
all
right
he
has
to
protect
the
bank
adams
is
a
doddering
imbecile
how
much
did
you
ask
him
for
five
thousand
dollars
i
offered
to
put
up
my
life
insurance
policy
for
that
amount
and
some
stock
i
own
he
said
money
was
tight
just
now
and
they
want
a
good
name
on
the
paper
besides
the
collateral
and
that
i
better
try
my
home
bank
i
did
do
that
of
course
because
montgomery
is
a
small
town
and
well
i
rather
not
advertise
my
affairs
to
a
whole
community
i
not
a
business
man
and
these
things
all
seem
terribly
complicated
and
embarrassing
to
me
but
you
tried
other
places
besides
adams
i
saw
it
in
your
eye
when
you
came
home
this
evening
that
you
had
struck
a
snag
well
well
so
money
is
tight
is
it
i
must
speak
to
tom
adams
about
that
he
told
me
yesterday
they
had
more
money
than
they
could
lend
and
that
the
banks
were
cutting
down
their
dividends
he
no
banker
he
ought
to
be
in
the
business
i
ca
blame
him
i
suppose
my
not
being
in
business
and
not
living
here
makes
a
difference
rubbish
but
you
ought
to
have
come
to
me
you
spoke
of
stock
that
in
shares
in
the
white
river
canneries
i
put
all
i
had
in
that
company
everybody
seemed
to
make
money
in
the
canning
business
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
investment
it
promised
well
in
the
prospectus
it
always
does
andrew
replied
the
old
lady
dryly
let
me
see
morton
bassett
was
in
that
i
believe
so
he
was
one
of
the
organizers
um
adams
told
me
there
had
been
a
reorganization
and
that
my
shares
were
valueless
well
well
so
you
were
one
of
the
suckers
that
put
money
into
that
canning
scheme
you
can
charge
it
off
andrew
let
drop
the
money
question
for
a
minute
i
want
to
talk
about
the
little
girl
yes
i
anxious
to
know
what
you
think
of
her
well
she
a
kelton
it
in
the
eyes
but
there
a
good
deal
of
her
grandmother
evans
in
her
too
let
me
see
your
wife
was
one
of
those
posey
county
evanses
i
remember
perfectly
the
old
original
evans
came
to
this
country
with
robert
owen
and
started
in
with
the
new
harmony
community
down
there
there
was
a
streak
o
genius
in
that
whole
set
but
about
sylvia
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
sylvia
mother
after
she
was
sylvia
age
i
do
think
you
did
she
was
away
at
school
a
good
many
years
sylvia
is
the
picture
of
her
mother
it
a
striking
likeness
but
their
natures
are
wholly
different
he
was
very
grave
and
the
despondency
that
he
had
begun
to
throw
off
settled
upon
him
again
andrew
who
was
sylvia
father
i
never
asked
you
that
question
before
and
maybe
i
ought
to
ask
it
now
but
i
often
wondered
let
me
see
what
was
your
daughter
name
edna
just
what
happened
to
edna
andrew
she
persisted
kelton
rose
and
paced
the
floor
thrice
he
crossed
the
room
then
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
davenport
beside
owen
i
do
know
sally
i
do
know
she
was
as
a
girl
a
little
willful
and
impulsive
but
with
the
best
heart
in
the
world
she
lost
her
mother
too
soon
and
in
her
girlhood
we
had
no
home
not
even
the
possible
to
naval
officers
she
had
a
good
natural
voice
and
wanted
to
study
music
so
after
we
had
been
settled
at
madison
college
a
year
i
left
her
in
new
york
with
a
woman
i
knew
pretty
well
the
widow
of
a
brother
officer
it
was
a
horrible
terrible
hideous
mistake
the
life
of
the
city
went
to
her
head
she
wanted
to
fit
herself
for
the
stage
and
they
told
me
she
could
do
it
had
the
gift
and
all
that
i
ought
never
to
have
left
her
down
there
but
what
could
i
do
there
was
nothing
in
a
town
like
montgomery
for
her
she
listen
to
it
you
did
your
best
andrew
you
do
have
to
prove
that
to
me
well
edna
ran
off
without
giving
me
any
hint
of
what
was
coming
it
was
a
queer
business
the
woman
i
had
counted
on
to
look
out
for
her
and
protect
her
seemed
utterly
astonished
at
her
disappearance
and
was
helpless
about
the
whole
matter
when
i
went
down
there
it
was
my
fault
all
my
fault
he
rose
and
flung
up
his
arms
with
a
gesture
of
passionate
despair
sit
down
andrew
and
let
go
through
with
it
she
said
calmly
i
reckon
these
things
are
hard
but
it
better
for
you
to
tell
me
you
ca
tell
everybody
and
somebody
ought
to
know
for
the
sake
of
the
little
girl
upstairs
you
better
tell
me
what
i
said
to
you
i
never
said
to
a
soul
he
went
on
carried
this
thing
all
these
years
and
have
never
mentioned
it
my
friends
at
the
college
are
the
noblest
people
on
earth
they
have
never
asked
questions
but
they
must
have
wondered
yes
and
i
wondered
too
since
the
first
time
you
came
here
and
told
me
you
had
brought
your
daughter
child
home
it
perfectly
natural
andrew
for
folks
to
wonder
go
on
and
tell
me
the
rest
the
rest
he
cried
oh
that
the
hardest
part
of
it
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
she
wrote
me
after
a
time
that
she
was
married
and
was
happy
but
she
did
explain
her
conduct
in
any
way
she
signed
herself
garrison
but
begged
me
not
to
try
to
find
her
she
said
her
husband
was
quite
prepared
to
disclose
his
marriage
to
his
family
but
that
it
would
all
be
right
soon
the
woman
with
whom
i
had
left
her
help
me
to
identify
him
in
any
way
at
least
she
did
help
me
there
had
been
a
number
of
young
men
boarding
in
the
neighborhood
medical
and
law
students
but
there
was
no
garrison
among
them
it
was
in
june
that
this
happened
and
when
i
went
down
to
try
to
trace
her
they
had
all
gone
i
was
never
quite
sure
whether
the
woman
dealt
squarely
with
me
or
not
but
it
was
my
fault
sally
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
have
no
excuse
to
offer
i
do
want
you
to
try
to
say
anything
that
would
make
my
lot
easier
it
was
not
sally
owen
way
to
extenuate
errors
of
commission
or
omission
her
mental
processes
were
always
singularly
direct
are
you
sure
she
was
married
did
you
find
any
proof
of
it
she
asked
bluntly
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
before
he
met
her
eyes
i
have
no
proof
of
it
all
i
have
is
edna
assurance
in
a
letter
their
gaze
held
while
they
read
each
other
thoughts
she
made
no
comment
there
was
nothing
to
say
to
this
nor
did
she
show
surprise
or
repugnance
at
the
dark
shadow
his
answer
had
flung
across
the
meagre
picture
and
garrison
who
was
he
i
do
know
even
that
from
all
i
could
learn
i
think
it
likely
he
was
a
student
in
one
of
the
professional
schools
but
whether
law
or
medicine
art
or
music
i
could
determine
the
whole
colony
of
students
had
scattered
to
the
four
winds
probably
garrison
was
not
his
real
name
but
that
is
wholly
an
assumption
it
clear
enough
that
whoever
the
man
was
and
whether
it
was
straight
or
not
edna
felt
bound
to
shield
him
that
just
like
us
fool
women
how
did
sylvia
come
to
your
hands
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
help
about
four
years
had
passed
since
i
lost
track
of
her
and
i
had
traveled
all
over
the
east
and
followed
every
clue
in
vain
i
spent
two
summers
in
new
york
walking
the
streets
in
the
blind
hope
that
i
might
meet
her
then
one
day
this
was
twelve
years
ago
i
had
a
telegram
from
the
superintendent
of
a
public
hospital
at
utica
that
edna
was
there
very
she
died
before
i
got
there
just
how
she
came
to
be
in
that
particular
place
i
have
no
idea
the
hospital
authorities
knew
nothing
except
that
she
had
gone
to
them
apparently
from
the
train
seriously
ill
the
little
girl
was
with
her
she
asked
them
to
send
for
me
but
told
them
nothing
of
herself
she
had
only
hand
baggage
and
it
told
us
nothing
as
to
her
home
if
she
had
one
or
where
she
was
going
her
clothing
the
nurse
pointed
out
was
of
a
style
several
years
old
but
it
was
clean
and
neat
most
surprising
of
all
she
had
with
her
several
hundred
dollars
but
there
was
nothing
whatever
by
which
to
reconstruct
her
life
in
those
blank
years
but
she
wrote
to
you
the
letters
would
have
given
a
clue
of
some
kind
the
few
letters
she
wrote
me
were
the
most
fragmentary
and
all
in
the
first
year
they
were
like
her
poor
child
her
letters
were
always
the
merest
scraps
in
all
of
them
she
said
she
would
come
home
in
due
course
that
some
of
her
husband
affairs
had
to
be
straightened
out
first
and
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
they
were
traveling
about
she
said
and
she
asked
me
not
to
try
to
write
to
her
the
first
letters
came
from
canada
montreal
and
quebec
then
one
from
albany
then
even
these
messages
ceased
and
i
heard
no
more
until
the
telegram
called
me
to
utica
she
had
never
mentioned
the
birth
of
the
child
i
know
i
do
even
know
where
sylvia
was
born
or
her
exact
age
the
nurse
at
the
hospital
said
edna
called
the
child
sylvia
i
overheard
sylvia
telling
ware
that
she
was
born
in
new
york
could
it
be
possible
no
she
knows
nothing
you
must
remember
that
she
was
only
three
when
she
began
to
ask
me
when
her
birthday
came
well
sally
i
felt
that
better
give
her
one
and
i
told
her
too
that
she
was
born
in
new
york
city
you
understand
of
course
andrew
you
did
perfectly
right
she
likely
to
ask
a
good
many
questions
now
that
she
growing
up
oh
he
cried
despairingly
she
already
asked
them
it
a
heartbreaking
business
i
tell
you
many
a
time
when
she
piped
up
in
our
walks
or
at
the
table
with
some
question
about
her
father
and
mother
i
ignored
it
or
feigned
not
to
hear
but
within
the
past
year
or
two
i
had
to
fashion
a
background
for
her
i
surrounded
her
origin
and
antecedents
with
a
whole
tissue
of
lies
but
sally
it
must
have
been
all
right
i
had
edna
own
word
for
it
he
pleaded
brokenly
it
must
have
been
all
right
well
what
if
it
was
does
it
make
any
difference
about
the
girl
all
this
mystery
is
a
good
thing
the
denser
the
better
maybe
as
long
as
there
any
doubt
at
all
your
good
name
protects
her
it
a
good
name
andrew
but
go
on
you
may
as
well
tell
me
the
whole
business
i
told
you
all
i
know
and
as
i
told
it
i
realized
more
than
before
how
pitifully
little
it
is
well
there
nothing
to
do
about
that
i
never
seen
any
sense
in
worrying
over
what
done
it
the
future
you
got
to
figure
on
for
sylvia
so
you
think
college
is
a
good
thing
for
girls
for
a
girl
like
sylvia
yes
but
i
want
your
opinion
you
the
only
person
in
the
world
i
can
talk
to
it
helped
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
to
shift
some
of
this
burden
to
you
maybe
it
is
fair
you
a
busy
woman
i
guess
i
not
so
busy
i
been
getting
lazy
and
needed
a
hard
jolt
i
been
wondering
a
good
deal
about
these
girls
colleges
some
of
this
new
woman
business
looks
awful
queer
to
me
but
so
did
the
electric
light
and
the
telephone
a
few
years
ago
and
i
can
even
remember
when
people
were
likely
to
drop
dead
when
they
got
their
first
telegram
sylvia
is
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
from
what
you
say
sylvia
is
much
like
her
mother
no
her
qualities
are
wholly
different
edna
had
a
different
mind
altogether
there
was
nothing
of
the
student
about
her
the
only
thing
that
interested
her
was
music
and
that
came
natural
to
her
i
studied
sylvia
carefully
i
ashamed
to
confess
how
carefully
fearing
that
she
would
grow
to
be
like
her
mother
but
another
sort
and
i
doubt
if
she
will
change
you
can
already
see
the
woman
in
her
that
child
sally
has
in
her
the
making
of
a
great
woman
i
been
careful
not
to
crowd
her
but
she
has
a
wonderful
mind
not
the
brilliant
sort
that
half
sees
things
in
lightning
flashes
but
a
vigorous
mind
that
can
grapple
with
a
problem
and
fight
it
out
afraid
to
tell
you
how
remarkable
i
think
she
is
no
poor
edna
was
not
like
that
she
hated
study
sylvia
very
quiet
but
i
reckon
she
takes
everything
in
it
in
her
eyes
that
she
different
and
i
guess
that
quietness
means
she
got
power
locked
up
in
her
children
do
show
it
now
marian
my
grandniece
is
a
different
sort
she
a
forthputting
youngster
that
going
to
be
hard
to
break
to
harness
she
looks
pretty
grazing
in
the
pasture
and
kicking
up
her
heels
but
i
do
see
what
class
she
going
to
fit
into
now
hallie
my
niece
bassett
she
one
of
these
club
fussers
always
studying
poetry
and
reading
papers
and
coming
up
to
town
to
state
conventions
or
federations
and
speaking
pieces
in
a
new
hat
hallie
smart
at
it
she
was
president
of
the
daughters
once
by
way
of
showing
that
our
folks
in
north
carolina
fought
in
the
revolution
which
i
reckon
they
did
though
i
never
saw
where
hallie
proved
it
but
the
speech
i
heard
her
make
at
the
propylæum
have
jarred
things
much
if
it
had
been
for
hallie
feathers
she
likes
her
clothes
she
always
had
you
know
my
brother
blackford
left
her
a
very
nice
fortune
and
morton
bassett
makes
money
well
as
i
started
to
say
there
all
kinds
of
women
the
old
ones
like
me
that
never
went
to
school
much
and
hallie
kind
that
sort
o
walked
through
the
orchard
and
picked
the
nearest
peaches
and
then
starts
in
at
thirty
to
take
courses
in
italian
art
and
marian
who
gives
her
teachers
nervous
prostration
and
sylvia
who
takes
to
books
naturally
there
are
all
kinds
of
girls
just
as
there
are
all
kinds
of
boys
good
students
real
scholars
have
always
been
rare
in
the
world
men
and
women
i
should
like
to
see
sylvia
go
high
and
far
i
should
like
her
to
have
every
chance
all
right
andrew
let
do
it
how
much
does
a
college
course
cost
for
a
girl
i
did
come
here
to
interest
you
in
the
money
side
of
it
sally
i
expected
answer
my
question
andrew
i
had
expected
to
give
her
a
course
for
five
thousand
dollars
the
actual
tuition
is
so
much
it
railroad
fare
clothing
and
other
expenses
owen
turned
towards
kelton
with
a
smile
on
her
kind
shrewd
face
andrew
just
to
please
me
i
want
you
to
let
me
be
partners
with
you
in
this
what
you
told
me
and
what
i
seen
of
that
little
girl
have
clinched
me
pretty
strong
i
wish
she
was
mine
my
little
elizabeth
would
be
a
grown
woman
if
she
lived
and
because
of
her
i
like
to
help
other
people
little
girls
you
know
i
helped
start
elizabeth
house
a
home
for
working
girls
and
i
getting
my
money
back
on
that
a
thousand
times
over
it
a
pretty
state
of
things
if
an
old
woman
like
me
without
a
chick
of
my
own
and
with
no
sense
but
horse
sense
ca
back
a
likely
filly
like
your
sylvia
i
want
you
to
let
me
call
her
our
sylvia
we
train
her
in
all
the
paces
andrew
and
i
hope
one
of
us
will
live
to
see
her
strike
the
home
stretch
come
into
my
office
a
minute
she
said
rising
and
leading
the
way
the
appointments
of
her
office
were
plain
and
substantial
a
desk
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
relic
of
the
lamented
jackson
owen
in
one
corner
was
an
iron
safe
in
which
she
kept
her
account
books
a
print
of
maud
adorned
one
wall
and
facing
it
across
the
room
hung
a
lithograph
of
thomas
hendricks
twice
a
week
a
young
woman
came
to
assist
owen
with
her
correspondence
and
accounts
a
concession
to
age
for
until
she
was
well
along
in
the
fifties
sally
owen
had
managed
these
things
alone
you
seen
my
before
andrew
small
but
select
i
knew
both
the
lady
and
the
gentleman
she
continued
with
one
of
her
humorous
flashes
i
went
to
cleveland
in
to
see
maud
she
ate
up
a
mile
in
the
prettiest
thing
i
ever
saw
you
know
bonner
bought
her
as
a
the
same
bonner
that
owned
the
york
ledger
i
used
to
read
the
clear
through
when
henry
ward
beecher
and
fanny
fern
wrote
for
it
none
of
these
new
magazines
touch
it
and
you
knew
tom
hendricks
that
a
good
picture
tom
looked
like
a
statesman
anyhow
and
that
more
than
most
of
do
she
continued
her
efforts
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
real
matter
at
hand
summoning
from
the
shadows
all
the
hoosier
statesmen
of
the
period
to
aid
her
and
she
purposely
declared
her
admiration
of
several
of
these
to
provoke
kelton
ire
that
right
andrew
jump
on
she
laughed
as
she
drew
from
the
desk
a
check
book
and
began
to
write
when
she
had
blotted
and
torn
out
the
check
she
examined
it
carefully
and
placed
it
near
him
on
the
edge
of
her
desk
now
andrew
kelton
there
a
check
for
six
thousand
dollars
we
call
that
our
educational
fund
you
furnish
the
girl
i
put
in
the
money
i
only
wish
i
had
the
girl
to
put
into
the
business
instead
of
the
cash
but
i
do
need
the
money
yet
i
sha
need
it
till
fall
he
protested
that
all
right
fall
pretty
close
and
you
feel
better
if
you
have
it
now
you
may
count
on
more
when
that
gone
if
you
want
it
in
case
anything
goes
wrong
with
you
or
me
it
be
fixed
i
attend
to
it
i
look
on
it
as
a
good
investment
your
note
look
here
andrew
kelton
if
you
mention
that
life
insurance
to
me
again
i
cut
your
acquaintance
you
go
to
bed
and
do
you
ever
let
on
to
that
baby
upstairs
that
i
have
any
hand
in
her
schooling
she
dropped
her
check
book
into
a
drawer
and
swung
round
in
her
swivel
chair
until
she
faced
him
i
do
want
to
open
up
that
affair
of
sylvia
mother
again
but
there
always
the
possibility
that
something
may
happen
you
know
edna
dead
but
there
always
a
chance
that
sylvia
father
may
turn
up
it
not
likely
but
there
no
telling
about
such
things
and
it
would
be
quite
fair
for
you
to
leave
her
unprepared
if
it
should
happen
there
one
more
circumstance
i
have
told
you
about
it
happened
only
a
few
days
ago
it
was
that
in
fact
which
crystallized
my
own
ideas
about
sylvia
education
a
letter
was
sent
to
me
by
a
stranger
offering
money
for
sylvia
schooling
the
whole
thing
was
surrounded
with
the
utmost
secrecy
so
then
some
one
is
watching
sylvia
keeping
track
of
her
and
must
be
kindly
disposed
from
that
you
never
heard
anything
before
never
i
was
asked
to
send
a
verbal
answer
by
the
messenger
who
brought
me
the
letter
accepting
or
declining
the
offer
i
declined
it
that
was
right
but
there
no
hiding
anything
in
this
world
you
must
have
some
idea
where
the
offer
came
from
i
have
the
slightest
not
the
remotest
idea
the
messenger
was
a
stranger
to
me
from
what
sylvia
said
he
was
a
stranger
at
montgomery
and
had
never
seen
the
college
before
time
had
begun
to
soften
the
whole
thing
and
the
knowledge
that
some
one
has
been
watching
the
child
all
these
years
troubles
me
it
roused
all
my
old
resentment
i
have
hardly
slept
since
it
occurred
it
queer
but
you
better
try
to
forget
it
somebody
conscience
is
hurting
i
reckon
i
would
know
how
to
account
for
it
in
any
other
way
if
it
a
case
of
conscience
it
may
have
satisfied
itself
by
offering
money
if
it
did
you
or
sylvia
may
hear
from
it
again
it
just
that
that
hurts
and
worries
me
the
possibility
that
this
person
may
trouble
sylvia
sometime
when
i
am
not
here
to
help
her
an
awful
thing
for
a
woman
to
go
out
into
the
world
followed
by
a
shadow
it
so
much
worse
for
a
woman
women
are
so
helpless
some
of
us
like
me
are
pretty
tough
too
sylvia
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
herself
you
do
need
to
worry
about
her
if
that
gnawing
some
man
conscience
and
i
reckon
it
is
you
can
forget
all
about
it
a
man
conscience
the
kind
of
man
that
would
abandon
a
woman
he
had
married
or
maybe
had
married
ai
going
to
be
a
ghost
that
walks
often
you
better
go
to
bed
andrew
kelton
lingered
to
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
open
he
had
enjoyed
an
experience
that
he
had
not
known
in
years
that
of
unburdening
himself
to
a
kindly
sympathetic
and
resourceful
woman
while
they
talked
of
her
sylvia
sat
in
her
in
the
dark
above
looking
at
the
stars
she
lingered
there
until
late
enjoying
the
cool
air
and
unwilling
to
terminate
in
sleep
so
eventful
a
day
she
heard
presently
her
grandfather
step
below
as
he
stood
watch
marking
his
brief
course
across
the
dim
garden
by
the
light
of
his
cigar
sylvia
was
very
happy
she
had
for
a
few
hours
breathed
the
ampler
ether
of
a
new
world
but
she
was
unconscious
in
her
dreaming
that
her
girlhood
that
had
been
as
tranquil
water
safe
from
current
and
commotion
now
felt
the
outward
drawing
of
the
tide
chapter
v
introducing
daniel
harwood
on
the
day
following
the
delivery
to
andrew
kelton
of
the
letter
in
which
money
for
sylvia
education
was
offered
by
an
unknown
person
the
bearer
of
the
message
was
to
be
seen
at
indianapolis
in
the
law
office
of
wright
and
fitch
attorneys
and
counselors
at
law
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
white
river
trust
company
building
in
washington
street
in
that
office
young
harwood
was
one
of
half
a
dozen
students
who
ran
errands
to
the
courts
kept
the
accounts
and
otherwise
made
themselves
useful
wright
and
fitch
was
the
principal
law
firm
in
the
state
in
the
period
under
scrutiny
as
may
readily
be
proved
by
an
examination
of
the
court
dockets
the
firm
practice
was
however
limited
persons
anxious
to
mulct
wicked
corporations
in
damages
for
physical
injuries
did
not
apply
to
wright
and
fitch
for
the
excellent
reason
that
this
capable
firm
was
retained
by
most
of
the
public
service
corporations
and
had
no
time
to
waste
on
the
petty
and
vexatious
claims
of
minor
litigants
wright
was
a
republican
fitch
a
democrat
and
each
of
these
gentlemen
occasionally
raised
his
voice
loud
enough
in
politics
to
emphasize
his
party
fealty
in
the
seventies
wright
had
served
a
term
as
city
attorney
on
the
other
hand
fitch
had
once
declined
the
italian
ambassadorship
both
had
been
mentioned
at
different
times
for
the
governorship
or
for
the
united
states
senate
and
both
had
declined
to
enter
the
lists
for
these
offices
daniel
harwood
had
been
graduated
from
yale
university
a
year
before
we
first
observed
him
and
though
the
world
lay
before
him
where
to
choose
he
returned
to
his
native
state
and
gave
himself
to
the
study
of
law
by
day
and
earned
a
livelihood
by
serving
the
courier
newspaper
by
night
as
harwood
is
to
appear
frequently
in
this
chronicle
it
may
be
well
to
summarize
briefly
the
facts
of
his
history
he
was
born
on
a
farm
in
harrison
county
and
his
aversion
to
farm
life
had
been
colored
from
earliest
childhood
by
the
difficulties
his
father
experienced
in
wringing
enough
money
out
of
eighty
acres
of
land
to
buy
food
and
clothing
and
to
pay
taxes
and
interest
on
an
insatiable
mortgage
held
somewhere
by
a
ruthless
life
insurance
company
that
seemed
most
unreasonably
insistent
in
its
collections
daniel
had
two
older
brothers
who
having
satisfied
their
passion
for
enlightenment
at
the
nearest
schoolhouse
meekly
enlisted
under
their
father
in
the
task
of
fighting
the
mortgage
daniel
with
a
weaker
hand
and
a
better
head
and
with
vastly
more
enterprise
resolved
to
go
to
yale
this
seemed
the
most
fatuous
the
most
profane
of
ambitions
if
college
at
all
why
not
the
state
university
to
support
which
the
harwood
eighty
acres
were
taxed
but
a
college
away
off
in
connecticut
there
were
no
precedents
for
this
in
harrison
county
no
harwood
within
the
memory
of
man
had
ever
adventured
farther
into
the
unknown
world
than
to
the
state
fair
at
indianapolis
and
when
it
came
to
education
both
the
judge
of
the
harrison
county
circuit
court
and
the
presiding
elder
of
the
district
had
climbed
to
fame
without
other
education
than
that
afforded
by
the
common
schools
daniel
choice
of
yale
had
been
determined
by
the
fact
that
a
professor
in
that
institution
had
once
addressed
the
county
teachers
and
young
harwood
had
been
greatly
impressed
by
him
the
yale
professor
was
the
first
graduate
of
an
eastern
university
that
daniel
had
ever
seen
and
he
became
the
young
hoosier
ideal
of
elegance
and
learning
daniel
had
acquired
at
this
time
all
that
the
county
school
offered
and
he
made
bold
to
approach
the
visitor
and
ask
his
advice
as
to
the
best
means
of
getting
to
college
we
need
not
trace
the
devious
course
by
which
after
much
burning
of
oil
during
half
a
dozen
winters
dan
harwood
attained
to
a
dignity
at
new
haven
where
arriving
with
his
effects
in
a
canvas
telescope
he
had
found
a
scholarship
awaiting
him
nor
need
we
do
more
than
record
the
fact
that
he
had
cared
for
furnaces
taken
the
night
shift
on
a
trolley
car
and
otherwise
earned
money
until
in
his
junior
year
his
income
from
newspaper
correspondence
and
tutoring
made
further
manual
labor
unnecessary
it
is
with
profound
regret
that
we
can
not
point
to
harwood
as
a
football
hero
or
the
mainstay
of
the
crew
having
ploughed
the
mortgaged
acres
and
tossed
hay
and
broken
colts
college
athletics
struck
him
as
rather
puerile
diversion
he
would
have
been
the
least
conspicuous
man
in
college
if
he
had
not
shone
in
debate
and
gathered
up
such
prizes
and
honors
as
were
accessible
in
that
field
his
big
booming
voice
recognizable
above
the
din
in
all
demonstrations
earned
for
him
the
sobriquet
of
foghorn
harwood
for
the
rest
he
studied
early
and
late
and
experienced
the
doubtful
glory
and
accepted
meekly
the
reproach
of
being
a
grind
history
and
the
dismal
science
had
interested
him
immensely
his
assiduous
attention
to
the
classes
of
professor
sumner
had
not
gone
unnoticed
by
that
eminent
instructor
who
once
called
him
by
name
in
chapel
street
much
to
dan
edification
he
thought
well
of
and
for
a
time
toyed
with
an
ambition
to
enrich
english
literature
with
contributions
of
his
own
during
this
period
he
contributed
to
the
lit
a
sonnet
called
the
which
began
at
rosy
dawn
i
see
thine
argosy
and
which
closed
with
the
invocation
fair
tides
reward
thy
long
laborious
days
the
sonnet
was
neatly
parodied
in
the
record
and
that
journal
printed
a
gratuitous
defense
of
the
fisherman
at
whom
presumably
the
poem
had
been
directed
the
sonnet
discloses
nothing
said
the
record
as
to
the
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
of
the
unfortunate
clammer
to
justify
a
son
of
eli
in
attacking
a
poor
man
laudably
engaged
in
a
perfectly
honorable
calling
the
sonneteer
coming
we
believe
from
the
unsalt
waters
of
the
wabash
seems
to
be
unaware
that
the
fisherman
at
whom
he
has
leveled
his
tuneful
lyre
is
not
seeking
fair
tides
but
clams
we
therefore
suggest
that
the
closing
line
of
the
sextette
be
amended
to
read
fair
clams
reward
thy
long
laborious
days
harwood
was
liked
by
his
fellow
students
in
the
law
office
two
yalensians
already
established
there
made
his
lot
easier
and
they
combined
against
a
lone
harvardian
who
bitterly
resented
habit
of
smoking
a
cob
pipe
in
the
library
at
night
the
bouquet
of
dan
pipe
was
pretty
well
dispelled
by
morning
save
to
the
discerning
nostril
of
the
harvard
man
who
protested
against
it
and
said
the
offense
was
indictable
at
common
law
harwood
stood
stoutly
for
his
rights
and
privileges
and
for
yale
democracy
which
he
declared
his
pipe
exemplified
there
was
much
banter
of
this
sort
in
the
office
harwood
was
busy
filing
papers
when
fitch
summoned
him
to
his
private
room
on
the
day
indicated
fitch
was
short
thin
and
bald
with
a
clipped
reddish
beard
brown
eyes
and
a
nose
he
was
considered
a
better
lawyer
than
wright
who
was
the
orator
of
the
firm
and
its
reliance
in
dealing
with
juries
in
the
preparation
of
briefs
and
in
oral
arguments
before
the
supreme
court
fitch
was
the
superior
his
personal
peculiarities
had
greatly
interested
harwood
as
for
example
fitch
manner
of
locking
himself
in
his
room
for
days
at
a
time
while
he
was
preparing
to
write
a
brief
denying
himself
to
all
visitors
and
only
occasionally
calling
for
books
from
the
library
then
when
he
had
formulated
his
ideas
he
summoned
the
stenographer
and
dictated
at
one
sitting
a
brief
that
generally
proved
to
be
the
reviewing
court
own
judgment
of
the
case
in
hand
some
of
fellow
practitioners
intimated
at
times
that
he
was
tricky
in
conferences
with
opposing
counsel
one
heard
he
required
watching
as
he
was
wary
of
committing
himself
and
it
was
difficult
to
discover
what
line
of
reasoning
he
elected
to
oppose
or
defend
in
such
conferences
it
was
his
fashion
to
begin
any
statement
that
might
seem
even
remotely
to
bind
him
with
the
remark
i
just
thinking
aloud
on
that
proposition
and
do
want
to
be
bound
by
what
i
say
the
students
in
the
office
to
whom
he
was
unfailingly
courteous
apostrophized
him
as
the
fox
he
called
them
all
mister
and
occasionally
flattered
them
by
presenting
a
hypothetical
case
for
their
consideration
fitch
was
sitting
before
the
immaculate
desk
he
affected
no
one
ever
dared
leave
anything
on
it
in
his
absence
when
harwood
entered
the
lawyer
chair
was
an
enormous
piece
of
furniture
in
which
his
small
figure
seemed
to
shrink
and
hide
his
hands
were
thrust
into
his
pockets
as
they
usually
were
and
he
piped
out
in
a
high
tenor
voice
shut
the
door
please
harwood
what
have
you
to
report
about
your
errand
to
montgomery
he
indicated
with
a
nod
the
one
chair
in
the
room
and
harwood
seated
himself
i
found
professor
kelton
without
difficulty
and
presented
the
letter
you
delivered
the
letter
and
you
have
told
no
one
of
your
visit
to
montgomery
no
one
sir
no
one
knows
i
have
been
away
from
town
i
handed
the
letter
to
the
gentleman
in
his
own
house
alone
and
he
gave
me
his
answer
well
is
the
answer
fitch
polished
his
eyeglasses
with
his
handkerchief
he
scrutinized
harwood
carefully
for
a
moment
then
asked
did
the
gentleman
whose
name
by
the
way
you
have
forgotten
yes
sir
i
have
quite
forgotten
it
harwood
replied
promptly
did
he
show
any
feeling
indignation
pique
as
he
read
the
letter
no
but
he
read
it
carefully
his
face
showed
pain
i
should
say
sir
rather
than
indignation
he
gave
his
negative
reply
coldly
a
little
sharply
he
was
very
courteous
a
gentleman
i
should
say
beyond
any
question
i
dare
say
what
kind
of
an
establishment
did
he
keep
a
small
cottage
with
books
everywhere
right
by
the
campus
a
young
girl
let
me
in
she
spoke
of
the
professor
as
her
grandfather
she
went
off
to
find
him
for
me
in
the
college
library
a
young
person
what
did
she
look
like
a
dark
young
miss
with
black
hair
tied
with
a
red
ribbon
fitch
smiled
you
are
sure
of
the
color
are
you
this
man
lives
there
with
his
granddaughter
and
the
place
was
simple
comfortable
no
luxuries
you
had
no
conversation
with
him
i
think
we
exchanged
a
word
about
the
weather
which
was
warm
fitch
smiled
again
his
was
a
rare
smile
but
it
was
worth
waiting
for
what
did
the
trip
cost
you
harwood
named
the
amount
and
the
lawyer
drew
a
check
book
from
his
impeccable
desk
and
wrote
i
have
added
one
hundred
dollars
for
your
services
this
is
a
personal
matter
between
you
and
me
and
does
not
go
on
the
office
books
by
the
way
harwood
what
are
you
doing
out
there
he
asked
moving
his
head
slightly
toward
the
outer
office
i
reading
law
is
it
possible
the
other
youngsters
in
the
office
seem
to
be
talking
politics
or
reading
newspapers
most
of
the
time
how
do
you
manage
to
live
i
do
some
work
for
the
from
time
to
time
ah
you
are
careful
not
to
let
your
legal
studies
get
mixed
with
the
newspaper
work
yes
sir
they
put
me
on
meetings
and
other
night
assignments
as
to
the
confidences
of
this
office
you
need
have
no
fear
of
my
i
have
harwood
let
me
see
it
was
of
you
professor
sumner
wrote
me
last
year
he
an
old
friend
of
mine
he
said
he
thought
you
had
a
sinewy
mind
a
strong
phrase
for
sumner
he
never
told
me
that
said
dan
laughing
he
several
times
implied
quite
the
reverse
he
a
great
man
sumner
i
suppose
you
absorbed
a
good
many
of
his
ideas
at
new
haven
i
hope
i
did
sir
i
believe
in
most
of
them
anyhow
so
do
i
mr
harwood
fitch
pointed
to
a
huge
pile
of
manuscript
on
a
table
by
the
window
it
was
a
stenographic
transcript
of
testimony
in
a
case
which
had
been
lost
in
the
trial
court
and
was
now
going
up
on
appeal
digest
that
evidence
and
give
me
the
gist
of
it
in
not
more
than
five
hundred
words
that
all
harwood
hand
was
on
the
door
when
fitch
arrested
him
with
a
word
to
recur
to
this
private
transaction
between
us
you
have
not
the
remotest
idea
what
was
in
that
letter
and
nothing
was
said
in
the
interview
that
gave
you
any
hint
is
that
entirely
correct
absolutely
very
well
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
myself
i
am
merely
accommodating
a
friend
we
need
not
refer
to
this
again
when
the
door
had
closed
the
lawyer
wrote
a
brief
note
which
he
placed
in
his
pocket
and
dropped
later
into
a
with
his
own
hand
fitch
of
the
law
firm
of
wright
and
fitch
was
not
in
the
habit
of
acting
as
agent
in
matters
he
did
comprehend
and
his
part
in
harwood
errand
was
not
to
his
liking
he
had
spoken
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he
knew
no
more
of
the
nature
of
the
letter
that
had
been
carried
to
professor
kelton
than
the
messenger
and
harwood
replies
to
his
interrogatories
had
told
him
nothing
many
matters
however
pressed
upon
his
attention
and
offered
abundant
exercise
for
his
curiosity
with
harwood
too
pleased
to
have
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
one
hundred
dollars
in
cash
the
incident
was
closed
chapter
vi
home
life
of
hoosier
statesmen
in
no
other
place
can
a
young
man
so
quickly
attain
wisdom
as
in
a
newspaper
office
there
the
names
of
the
good
and
great
are
playthings
and
the
bubble
reputation
is
blown
lightly
and
as
readily
extinguished
as
part
of
the
day
business
no
other
employment
offers
so
many
excitements
in
nothing
else
does
the
laborer
live
so
truly
behind
the
scenes
the
stage
is
wide
the
action
varied
and
constant
the
youngest
tyro
watching
from
the
wings
observes
great
incidents
and
becomes
their
hasty
historian
the
reporter
status
is
unique
youth
on
the
threshold
of
no
other
profession
commands
the
same
respect
gains
audience
so
readily
to
the
same
august
personages
doors
slammed
in
his
face
only
flatter
his
he
becomes
cynical
as
he
sees
how
easily
the
spot
light
is
made
to
flash
upon
the
unworthiest
figures
by
the
flimsiest
mechanism
he
drops
his
plummet
into
shoal
and
deep
water
and
from
his
contemplation
of
the
shore
grows
skeptical
of
the
wisdom
of
all
pilots
harwood
connection
with
the
courier
brought
him
in
touch
with
politics
which
interested
him
greatly
the
courier
was
the
organ
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
state
and
though
his
father
and
brothers
in
the
country
were
republicans
dan
found
himself
more
in
sympathy
with
the
views
represented
by
the
democratic
party
even
after
it
abandoned
its
ancient
conservatism
and
became
aggressively
radical
about
the
time
of
harwood
return
to
his
native
state
the
newspaper
had
changed
hands
at
least
the
corporation
which
had
owned
it
for
a
number
of
years
had
apparently
disposed
of
it
though
the
transaction
had
been
effected
so
quietly
that
the
public
received
no
outward
hint
beyond
the
deletion
of
published
by
the
courier
newspaper
company
from
the
head
of
the
editorial
page
the
policy
of
the
paper
continued
unchanged
the
editorial
staff
had
not
been
disturbed
and
in
the
there
had
been
no
revolution
though
an
utterly
unknown
man
had
appeared
bearing
the
title
of
general
manager
which
carried
with
it
authority
in
all
departments
this
person
was
supposed
to
represent
the
unknown
proprietor
about
whom
there
had
been
the
liveliest
speculation
the
courier
rivals
gave
much
space
to
rumors
real
and
imaginary
as
to
the
new
ownership
attributing
the
purchase
to
a
number
of
prominent
politicians
in
rapid
succession
and
to
syndicates
that
had
never
existed
it
was
an
odd
effect
of
the
change
in
the
courier
ownership
that
almost
immediately
mystery
seemed
to
envelop
the
editorial
rooms
the
managing
editor
whose
humors
and
moods
fixed
the
tone
of
the
office
may
have
been
responsible
but
whatever
the
cause
a
stricter
discipline
was
manifest
and
editors
reporters
and
moved
and
labored
with
a
consciousness
that
an
unknown
being
walked
among
the
desks
and
hung
over
the
forms
to
the
very
last
moment
before
they
were
hurled
to
the
stereotypers
the
editorial
writers
those
astute
counselors
of
the
public
who
are
and
by
their
associates
on
the
news
side
of
every
american
newspaper
wrote
uneasily
under
a
mysterious
hidden
censorship
it
was
possible
that
even
the
young
woman
who
gleaned
society
news
might
by
some
unfortunate
slip
offend
the
invisible
proprietor
but
as
time
passed
nothing
happened
the
imaginable
opaque
pane
that
separated
the
owner
from
the
desks
of
the
courier
reporters
and
philosophers
had
disclosed
no
faintest
shadow
occasionally
the
managing
editor
was
summoned
below
by
the
general
manager
but
the
subordinates
in
the
news
department
were
unable
even
by
much
careful
study
of
their
subsequent
instructions
to
grasp
the
slightest
thread
that
might
lead
them
to
the
concealed
hand
which
swayed
the
courier
destiny
it
must
be
confessed
that
under
this
ghostly
administration
the
paper
improved
every
man
did
his
best
and
the
circulation
statements
as
published
monthly
indicated
a
widening
constituency
even
the
sunday
edition
long
a
forbidding
and
depressing
of
and
rubbish
began
to
show
order
and
intelligence
in
october
following
his
visit
to
professor
kelton
harwood
was
sent
to
fraserville
the
seat
of
fraser
county
to
write
a
sketch
of
the
honorable
morton
bassett
in
a
series
then
adorning
the
sunday
supplement
under
the
title
home
life
of
hoosier
statesmen
the
object
of
the
series
was
frankly
to
aid
the
circulation
efforts
to
build
up
subscription
lists
in
the
rural
districts
and
personal
sketches
of
local
celebrities
had
proved
potent
in
this
endeavor
most
of
the
subjects
that
had
fallen
to
harwood
lot
had
been
of
a
familiar
type
country
lawyers
who
sat
in
the
legislature
or
county
chairmen
or
judges
of
county
courts
as
the
sunday
courier
eschewed
politics
the
series
was
not
restricted
to
democrats
but
included
men
of
all
faiths
it
was
harwood
habit
to
spend
a
day
in
the
towns
he
visited
gathering
local
color
and
collecting
anecdotal
matter
while
this
employment
cut
deeply
into
his
hours
at
the
law
office
he
reasoned
that
there
was
a
compensating
advantage
in
the
knowledge
he
gained
on
these
excursions
of
the
men
of
both
political
faiths
before
the
train
stopped
at
fraserville
he
saw
from
the
car
window
the
name
bassett
written
large
on
a
towering
elevator
a
fact
which
he
noted
carefully
as
offering
a
suggestion
for
the
introductory
line
of
his
sketch
as
he
left
the
station
and
struck
off
toward
the
heart
of
the
town
he
was
aware
that
bassett
was
a
name
that
appealed
to
the
eye
frequently
the
bassett
block
and
bassett
bank
spoke
not
merely
for
a
material
prosperity
rare
among
the
local
statesmen
he
had
described
in
the
courier
but
judging
from
the
prominence
of
the
name
in
fraserville
nomenclature
he
assumed
that
it
had
long
been
established
in
the
community
harwood
had
not
previously
faced
a
second
generation
in
his
pursuit
of
hoosier
celebrities
and
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
prospect
of
a
variation
on
the
threadbare
scenario
of
early
hardship
the
little
red
schoolhouse
patient
industry
and
the
laborious
attainment
of
meagre
political
honors
which
had
begun
to
bore
him
harwood
sought
first
the
editor
of
the
fraser
county
democrat
who
was
also
the
courier
fraserville
correspondent
fraserville
boasted
two
other
newspapers
the
republican
which
offset
the
democrat
politically
and
the
news
an
independent
afternoon
daily
whose
function
was
to
encourage
strife
between
its
weekly
contemporaries
and
boom
the
commercial
interests
of
the
town
the
editor
of
the
democrat
was
an
extremely
stout
person
who
sprawled
at
ease
in
a
battered
swivel
chair
with
his
slippered
feet
thrown
across
a
desk
littered
with
newspapers
clippings
letters
and
manuscript
a
file
hook
was
suspended
on
the
wall
over
his
shoulder
and
on
this
it
was
his
habit
to
impale
by
a
remarkable
twist
of
body
and
arm
gems
for
his
hebdomadal
journal
he
wrote
on
a
pad
held
in
his
ample
lap
the
paste
brush
was
within
easy
reach
and
once
planted
on
his
throne
the
editor
was
established
for
the
day
bound
volumes
of
the
congressional
record
in
their
original
wrappers
were
piled
in
a
corner
a
consular
report
folded
in
half
was
thrust
under
the
editor
right
thigh
easly
accessible
in
ferocious
moments
when
he
indulged
himself
in
the
felicity
of
slaughtering
the
roaches
with
which
the
place
swarmed
he
gave
dan
a
limp
fat
hand
and
cleared
a
chair
of
exchanges
with
one
foot
which
he
thereupon
laboriously
restored
to
its
accustomed
place
on
the
desk
so
you
from
the
well
sir
you
may
tell
your
managing
editor
for
me
that
if
he
does
print
more
of
my
stuff
he
can
get
somebody
else
on
the
job
here
dan
soothed
pettit
feelings
as
best
he
could
he
confessed
that
his
own
best
work
was
mercilessly
cut
and
that
after
all
the
editors
of
city
newspapers
were
poor
judges
of
the
essential
character
of
news
when
pettit
good
humor
had
been
restored
dan
broached
the
nature
of
his
errand
as
he
mentioned
morton
bassett
name
the
huge
editor
face
grew
blank
for
a
moment
then
he
was
shaken
with
mirth
that
passed
from
faint
quivers
until
his
whole
frame
was
convulsed
his
rickety
chair
trembled
and
rattled
ominously
it
was
noiseless
laughter
so
far
as
any
vocal
manifestations
were
concerned
but
it
shook
the
gigantic
editor
as
though
he
were
a
mould
of
jelly
he
closed
his
eyes
but
otherwise
his
fat
face
was
expressionless
goin
to
write
mort
up
are
you
well
by
gum
i
been
readin
those
pieces
in
the
your
work
good
writin
mighty
readin
as
old
uncle
horace
greeley
used
to
say
i
guess
you
carry
the
whitewash
brush
along
with
you
in
your
pilgrimages
you
certainly
did
give
bill
ragsdale
a
clean
bill
o
health
that
must
have
tickled
the
folks
in
tecumseh
county
know
ragsdale
i
set
with
bill
in
the
lower
house
three
sessions
and
i
come
pretty
near
knowin
him
i
do
say
that
bill
is
crooked
but
i
suspect
that
if
bill
moral
nature
could
be
dug
out
and
exposed
to
view
it
would
be
spiral
like
a
bedspring
just
about
it
an
awful
load
on
the
republican
party
in
this
state
having
to
carry
bill
ragsdale
o
lord
he
pursed
his
fat
lips
and
his
eyes
took
on
a
expression
as
though
some
profound
utterance
had
diverted
his
thoughts
to
remote
realms
of
reverie
so
you
goin
to
write
mort
up
well
my
god
the
exact
relevance
of
this
was
not
apparent
harwood
had
assumed
on
general
principles
that
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
of
the
fraser
county
democrat
was
an
humble
and
obedient
servant
of
the
honorable
morton
bassett
and
would
cringe
at
the
mention
of
his
name
to
be
sure
pettit
had
said
nothing
to
disturb
this
belief
but
neither
had
the
editor
manifested
that
meek
submission
for
which
the
reporter
had
been
prepared
the
editor
gargantuan
girth
trembled
again
the
spectacle
he
presented
as
he
shook
thus
with
inexplicable
mirth
was
so
funny
that
harwood
grinned
whereupon
pettit
rubbed
one
of
his
great
hands
across
his
growth
of
beard
evoking
a
harsh
rasping
sound
in
which
he
seemed
to
find
relief
and
satisfaction
you
do
know
mort
well
he
all
right
he
will
he
mighty
nice
to
you
mort
one
of
the
best
fellows
on
earth
you
wo
find
anybody
out
here
in
fraser
county
to
say
anything
against
mort
bassett
no
sir
by
god
again
the
ponderous
frame
shook
again
the
mysterious
look
came
into
the
man
curious
small
eyes
and
harwood
witnessed
another
seismic
disturbance
in
the
bulk
before
him
then
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
grew
serious
you
want
some
facts
for
a
starter
well
i
guess
a
few
facts
do
hurt
in
this
business
providin
you
do
push
in
too
many
of
he
pondered
for
a
moment
then
went
on
as
though
summarizing
from
a
biography
only
child
of
the
late
jeremiah
bassett
founder
of
bassett
bank
old
jerry
was
pure
boiler
plate
he
could
squeeze
ten
per
cent
interest
out
of
a
frozen
parsnip
he
and
blackford
singleton
sort
o
divided
things
up
in
this
section
jerry
bassett
corralled
the
coin
blackford
rolled
up
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
and
capped
it
with
a
united
states
senatorship
mort
not
forty
yet
married
only
child
of
blackford
singleton
jerry
made
the
match
i
guess
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
get
blackford
money
mort
prepared
for
college
but
did
go
took
his
degree
in
law
at
columbia
but
never
practiced
always
interested
in
politics
been
in
the
state
senate
twelve
years
two
children
boy
and
girl
i
guess
mort
bassett
can
do
most
anything
he
wants
to
you
tell
where
he
land
but
the
next
steps
are
obvious
suggested
harwood
encouragingly
the
governorship
the
united
states
senate
ever
onward
and
upward
well
yes
but
you
never
know
anything
from
do
know
and
you
might
think
we
understand
him
pretty
well
up
here
he
declined
to
go
to
congress
from
this
district
could
have
had
it
without
turning
a
hand
but
he
put
in
his
man
and
stayed
in
the
state
senate
i
reckon
he
cuts
some
ice
there
but
he
mighty
quiet
bassett
does
beat
the
to
call
attention
to
himself
i
guess
no
man
swings
more
influence
in
a
state
convention
but
he
peculiar
you
find
him
different
from
these
yahoos
you
been
writin
up
i
know
all
a
man
of
influence
and
power
leading
citizen
in
every
sense
dan
murmured
as
he
scribbled
a
few
notes
yep
mort
considered
rich
you
may
have
noticed
his
name
printed
on
most
everything
but
the
undertaker
and
the
jail
as
you
came
up
from
the
station
the
elevator
and
the
bank
he
inherited
from
his
pap
got
a
finger
in
most
everything
here
owns
everything
said
harwood
with
an
attempt
at
facetiousness
except
the
brewery
pettit
eyes
opened
wide
and
then
closed
again
he
was
it
seemed
that
the
idea
of
linking
morton
bassett
name
with
the
manufacture
of
malt
liquor
was
the
most
stupendous
joke
possible
the
editor
face
did
not
change
expression
the
internal
disturbances
were
not
more
violent
this
time
but
they
continued
longer
when
the
strange
spasm
had
passed
he
dug
a
fat
fist
into
a
tearful
right
eye
and
was
calm
oh
my
god
he
blurted
huskily
breweries
let
us
say
that
he
neither
makes
nor
consumes
malt
vinous
nor
spirituous
liquor
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutes
in
such
cases
made
and
provided
he
and
ed
thatcher
make
a
strong
team
ed
started
out
as
a
brewer
but
nothing
wrong
about
that
i
reckon
over
in
england
they
make
lords
and
dukes
of
brewers
a
man
of
rectitude
enshrined
in
the
hearts
of
his
popular
and
all
that
suggested
harwood
yes
mort
rather
his
heat
i
guess
some
say
he
cold
as
ice
his
ice
is
the
kind
that
freezes
to
what
he
likes
mort
a
gentleman
if
we
have
one
in
fraser
county
if
you
think
you
chasin
one
of
these
blue
jeans
politicians
you
read
about
in
comic
papers
you
hitting
the
wrong
trail
son
mort
can
eat
with
a
fork
without
good
lord
boy
if
you
can
say
these
other
fellows
in
indiana
politics
have
brains
you
got
to
say
that
mort
bassett
has
which
is
different
son
a
dern
sight
different
i
shall
be
glad
to
use
the
word
in
my
sketch
of
bassett
remarked
dan
dryly
it
will
lend
variety
to
the
series
harwood
thanked
the
editor
for
his
courtesy
and
walked
to
the
door
strange
creakings
from
the
editorial
chair
caused
him
to
turn
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
was
in
the
throes
of
another
convulsion
the
attack
seemed
more
severe
than
its
predecessors
dan
waited
for
him
to
invoke
deity
with
the
asthmatic
wheeziness
to
which
mirth
reduced
his
vocal
apparatus
it
nothin
son
it
nothin
it
my
temperament
i
ca
help
it
did
you
say
you
were
from
the
well
you
better
give
mort
a
good
he
appreciates
a
good
job
he
a
sort
o
literary
cuss
himself
as
another
mirthful
spasm
seemed
imminent
dan
retired
wondering
just
what
in
himself
or
in
his
errand
had
so
moved
the
fat
risibilities
he
learned
at
the
bassett
bank
that
bassett
was
spending
the
day
in
a
neighboring
town
but
would
be
home
at
six
so
he
surveyed
fraserville
and
killed
time
until
evening
eating
luncheon
and
supper
with
sundry
commercial
travelers
at
the
grand
hotel
harwood
instructions
were
in
every
case
to
take
the
subjects
of
his
sketches
at
their
own
valuation
and
to
set
them
forth
sympathetically
the
ambitions
of
most
of
the
gentlemen
he
had
interviewed
had
been
obvious
obvious
and
futile
nearly
every
man
who
reached
the
legislature
felt
a
higher
call
to
congress
or
the
governor
chair
harwood
had
already
described
in
the
courier
the
attainments
of
several
statesmen
who
were
willing
to
sacrifice
their
private
interests
for
the
high
seat
at
the
state
capitol
the
pettiness
and
sordidness
of
most
of
the
politicians
he
met
struck
him
humorously
but
the
tone
of
his
articles
was
uniformly
laudatory
when
the
iron
gate
clicked
behind
him
at
the
bassett
residence
his
notebook
was
still
barren
of
such
anecdotes
of
his
subject
as
he
had
usually
gathered
in
like
cases
in
an
afternoon
spent
at
the
stories
of
generosity
of
the
kindly
care
of
widows
and
orphans
gifts
to
indigent
pastors
boys
helped
through
college
and
similar
benefactions
had
proved
altogether
elusive
either
harwood
had
sought
in
the
wrong
places
or
morton
bassett
was
of
tougher
fibre
than
the
other
gentlemen
on
whom
his
pencil
had
conferred
immortality
in
response
to
his
ring
a
boy
opened
the
door
and
admitted
him
without
parley
he
had
a
card
ready
to
offer
but
the
lad
ran
to
announce
him
without
waiting
for
his
name
and
reappeared
promptly
papa
says
to
come
right
in
sir
the
boy
reported
dan
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
girl
at
the
piano
in
the
parlor
who
turned
to
glance
at
him
and
continued
her
playing
the
lad
indicated
an
open
door
midway
of
the
long
hall
and
waited
for
harwood
to
enter
a
lady
carrying
a
small
workbasket
in
her
hand
bade
the
reporter
as
she
passed
out
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
white
and
black
belligerents
stood
at
truce
and
from
the
interrupted
game
rose
a
man
of
medium
height
with
dark
hair
and
a
mustache
who
came
toward
him
inquiringly
i
am
bassett
have
a
chair
harwood
felt
the
guilt
of
his
intrusion
upon
a
scene
so
sheltered
and
domestic
the
father
had
evidently
been
playing
checkers
with
his
son
the
mother
chair
still
rocked
by
another
table
on
which
stood
a
reading
lamp
harwood
stated
his
errand
and
bassett
merely
nodded
offering
none
of
those
protestations
of
surprise
and
humility
those
pleas
of
unworthiness
that
his
predecessors
on
dan
list
had
usually
insisted
upon
dan
made
mental
note
at
once
of
the
figure
before
him
jaw
was
square
and
firm
power
was
manifest
there
unmistakably
and
his
bristling
mustache
suggested
combativeness
his
dark
eyes
met
harwood
gaze
steadily
hardness
might
be
there
though
their
gaze
was
friendly
enough
his
voice
was
deep
and
its
tone
was
pleasant
he
opened
a
drawer
and
produced
a
box
of
cigars
wo
you
smoke
i
do
smoke
myself
but
you
must
mind
that
and
harwood
accepted
a
cigar
which
he
found
excellent
a
moment
later
a
maid
placed
on
the
table
beside
the
checkerboard
a
tray
with
a
decanter
and
glasses
and
a
pitcher
of
water
that
for
us
remarked
bassett
nodding
toward
the
glasses
help
yourself
the
cigar
is
all
i
need
thank
you
the
reporter
was
prepared
to
ask
questions
following
a
routine
he
had
employed
with
other
subjects
but
bassett
began
to
talk
on
his
own
initiative
of
the
town
the
county
the
district
he
expressed
himself
well
in
terse
words
and
phrases
harwood
did
not
attempt
to
direct
or
lead
bassett
had
taken
the
interview
into
his
own
hands
and
was
imparting
information
that
might
have
been
derived
from
a
local
history
at
the
town
library
dan
ceased
after
a
time
to
follow
the
narrative
in
his
absorption
in
the
man
himself
harwood
took
his
politics
seriously
and
the
petty
politicians
with
whom
he
had
thus
far
become
acquainted
in
his
newspaper
work
had
impressed
him
chiefly
by
their
bigotry
or
venality
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
had
worshiped
at
sumner
feet
at
yale
and
he
held
views
that
were
not
readily
reconcilable
with
parochial
and
the
meek
swallowing
of
platforms
bassett
was
not
the
vulgar
intimate
who
slapped
every
man
on
the
back
the
teller
of
good
stories
over
a
glass
of
whiskey
and
a
cigar
he
was
as
pettit
had
said
a
new
type
not
of
the
familiar
the
decanter
was
a
property
placed
in
the
scene
at
the
dictates
of
hospitality
the
checkerboard
canceled
any
suggestion
of
conviviality
that
might
have
been
conveyed
by
the
decanter
of
whiskey
bassett
right
hand
lay
on
the
table
and
dan
found
himself
watching
it
it
was
broad
but
not
heavy
the
fingers
that
opened
and
shut
quietly
on
a
small
paperweight
were
supple
it
was
a
hand
that
would
deal
few
blows
but
hard
ones
harwood
was
aware
at
a
moment
when
he
began
to
be
bored
by
the
bald
facts
of
local
history
that
bassett
had
abruptly
switched
the
subject
parties
are
necessary
to
democratic
government
i
do
believe
merely
in
my
own
party
i
want
the
opposition
to
be
strong
enough
to
make
a
fight
the
people
are
better
satisfied
if
there
a
contest
for
the
offices
i
not
sorry
when
we
lose
occasionally
defeat
disciplines
and
strengthens
a
party
i
have
made
a
point
in
our
little
local
affairs
of
not
fighting
independents
when
they
break
with
us
for
any
reason
believing
as
i
do
that
parties
are
essential
and
that
schismatic
movements
are
futile
i
make
a
point
of
not
attacking
them
their
failures
strengthen
the
party
and
incidentally
kill
the
men
who
have
kicked
out
of
the
traces
you
never
have
to
bother
with
them
a
second
time
but
they
help
clear
the
air
they
serve
a
purpose
suggested
harwood
he
had
acquired
a
taste
for
the
nation
and
the
new
york
evening
post
at
college
and
bassett
frank
statement
of
his
political
opinions
struck
dan
as
mediæval
he
was
however
instinctively
a
reporter
and
he
refrained
from
interposing
himself
further
than
was
necessary
to
stimulate
the
talk
of
the
man
before
him
you
are
quite
right
harwood
they
serve
an
excellent
purpose
they
provide
an
outlet
they
serve
as
a
safety
valve
now
and
then
they
will
win
a
fight
and
that
a
good
thing
too
for
they
will
prove
on
experiment
that
they
are
just
as
human
and
weak
in
practical
application
of
their
ideas
as
the
rest
of
us
i
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
in
certain
circumstances
i
let
them
win
they
help
drive
home
my
idea
that
the
old
parties
like
old
established
business
houses
have
got
to
maintain
a
standard
or
they
will
lose
the
business
to
which
they
are
rightfully
entitled
when
you
see
your
customers
passing
your
front
door
to
try
a
new
shop
farther
up
the
street
you
want
to
sit
down
and
consider
what
the
matter
and
devise
means
of
regaining
your
lost
ground
it
does
pay
merely
to
ridicule
the
new
man
or
cry
that
his
goods
are
inferior
yours
have
got
to
be
superior
or
and
the
gray
eyes
twinkled
for
the
first
time
they
must
be
dressed
up
to
look
better
in
your
show
window
bassett
rose
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
before
he
sat
down
he
poured
himself
a
glass
of
water
from
the
pitcher
and
drank
it
slowly
with
an
air
of
preoccupation
he
moved
easily
with
a
quicker
step
than
might
have
been
expected
in
one
of
his
figure
the
strength
of
his
hand
was
also
in
the
firm
line
of
his
vigorous
frame
and
his
rather
large
head
dan
observed
rested
solidly
on
broad
shoulders
harwood
thoughts
were
however
given
another
turn
at
once
morton
bassett
had
said
all
he
cared
to
say
about
politics
and
he
now
asked
dan
whether
he
was
a
college
man
to
which
prompting
the
reporter
recited
succinctly
the
annals
of
his
life
you
a
harrison
county
boy
are
you
so
you
did
like
the
farm
and
found
a
way
out
that
good
you
may
be
interested
in
some
of
my
books
dan
was
immediately
on
guard
against
being
bored
the
library
of
even
an
intelligent
local
statesman
like
morton
bassett
was
hardly
likely
to
prove
interesting
one
of
his
earlier
subjects
had
asked
him
particularly
to
mention
his
library
which
consisted
mainly
of
government
reports
i
been
a
collector
of
americana
bassett
remarked
throwing
open
several
cases
i
gone
in
for
colonial
history
particularly
and
some
of
these
things
are
pretty
rare
the
shelves
rose
to
the
ceiling
and
bassett
produced
a
ladder
that
he
might
hand
down
a
few
of
the
more
interesting
volumes
for
dan
closer
inspection
here
wainwright
description
of
the
ohio
river
with
some
account
of
the
savages
living
thereon
published
in
london
in
and
there
are
only
three
copies
in
existence
this
is
of
the
chesapeake
settlements
the
best
thing
i
have
the
author
was
an
english
sailor
who
joined
the
colonists
in
the
revolution
and
published
a
little
memoir
of
his
adventures
in
america
the
only
other
copy
of
that
known
to
exist
is
in
the
british
museum
i
fished
mine
out
of
a
pile
of
junk
in
baltimore
about
ten
years
ago
when
i
get
old
and
have
time
on
my
hands
i
going
to
reprint
some
of
these
wide
margins
and
footnotes
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
there
fun
enough
now
in
just
having
them
and
knowing
the
other
fellow
has
he
flung
open
a
panel
of
the
wainscoting
at
a
point
still
free
of
shelves
and
disclosed
a
door
of
a
small
iron
safe
which
he
opened
with
a
key
this
is
the
family
silver
but
a
few
little
things
that
are
more
valuable
these
are
first
editions
of
american
authors
lowell
for
critics
first
edition
and
this
is
a
first
these
are
bound
by
orpcutt
had
them
done
myself
they
feel
good
to
the
hand
do
they
harwood
pleasure
in
the
beautiful
specimens
of
the
binder
art
was
unfeigned
and
to
his
questioning
bassett
dilated
upon
the
craftsmanship
the
red
morocco
of
the
emerson
takes
the
gold
tooling
beautifully
and
the
border
design
could
be
finer
i
believe
this
shade
is
the
best
of
all
this
whittier
a
first
edition
of
war
time
is
by
durand
a
french
artist
and
one
of
the
best
specimens
of
his
work
those
strong
hands
of
his
touched
the
beautiful
books
fondly
harwood
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
bassett
carried
to
the
lamp
under
the
willows
in
gold
and
brown
the
better
to
display
the
deft
workmanship
to
look
more
closely
at
the
owner
of
these
lovely
baubles
the
iron
hand
could
be
very
gentle
bassett
touched
the
volume
caressingly
as
he
called
attention
to
its
perfection
his
face
in
the
lamp
full
light
softened
but
there
was
in
it
no
hint
of
sensuousness
to
prepare
one
for
this
indulgence
in
luxurious
bibliomania
there
was
a
childlike
simplicity
in
bassett
delight
a
man
who
enjoyed
such
playthings
could
not
be
hard
and
dan
heart
warmed
with
liking
are
you
a
reader
of
poetry
asked
dan
as
bassett
carefully
collected
the
books
and
returned
them
to
the
safe
no
that
is
something
we
leave
behind
us
with
our
youth
he
said
and
looking
down
at
the
bent
head
and
sturdy
shoulders
and
watching
the
strong
fingers
turning
the
key
dan
wondered
what
the
man
youth
had
been
and
what
elements
were
mixed
in
him
that
soft
textures
of
leather
and
delicate
tracings
of
gold
on
brown
and
scarlet
and
olive
could
so
delight
him
his
rather
jaunty
attitude
toward
the
home
life
of
hoosier
statesmen
experienced
a
change
morton
bassett
was
not
a
man
who
could
be
hit
off
in
a
few
hundred
words
but
a
complex
character
he
did
not
pretend
to
understand
threads
of
various
hues
had
passed
before
him
but
how
to
intertwine
them
was
a
question
that
already
puzzled
the
reporter
bassett
had
rested
his
hand
on
dan
shoulder
for
a
moment
as
the
younger
man
bent
over
one
of
the
prized
volumes
and
dan
was
not
insensible
to
the
friendliness
of
the
act
bassett
and
the
two
children
appeared
at
the
door
a
little
later
come
in
hallie
said
the
politician
all
of
you
come
in
he
introduced
the
reporter
to
his
wife
and
to
marian
the
daughter
and
blackford
the
son
the
children
were
just
going
up
said
bassett
as
it
saturday
they
have
an
hour
added
to
their
evening
i
think
i
heard
bassett
talking
of
books
a
moment
ago
it
not
often
he
brings
out
his
first
editions
for
a
visitor
they
talked
of
books
for
a
moment
while
the
children
listened
then
bassett
recurred
to
the
fact
already
elicited
that
harwood
was
a
yale
man
whereupon
colleges
were
discussed
many
of
our
small
colleges
do
excellent
work
remarked
bassett
some
educator
has
explained
the
difference
between
large
and
small
colleges
by
saying
that
in
the
large
one
the
boy
goes
through
more
college
but
in
the
small
one
more
college
goes
through
the
boy
of
course
i
not
implying
harwood
that
that
was
true
in
your
case
oh
i
not
sensitive
about
that
bassett
and
i
beg
not
to
be
taken
as
an
example
of
what
yale
does
for
her
students
some
of
the
smaller
colleges
stand
for
the
best
things
there
madison
college
here
in
our
own
state
its
standards
are
severely
high
and
the
place
itself
has
quality
atmosphere
you
feel
even
as
a
casual
visitor
that
it
the
real
thing
so
i
always
heard
remarked
bassett
my
father
always
admired
madison
strange
to
say
i
have
never
been
there
are
you
acquainted
in
montgomery
bassett
bent
forward
slightly
at
the
question
i
was
there
for
an
hour
or
so
last
spring
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
i
did
even
take
time
to
run
into
my
fraternity
house
though
i
saw
its
banner
on
the
outer
wall
your
newspaper
work
must
give
you
many
interesting
adventures
suggested
the
politician
not
always
as
pleasant
as
this
i
assure
you
but
i
a
person
of
two
occupations
i
studying
law
and
my
visit
to
montgomery
was
on
an
errand
for
the
office
where
i
allowed
to
use
the
books
in
return
for
slight
services
of
one
kind
and
another
as
a
newspaper
man
something
of
an
impostor
i
hope
i
only
a
passing
pilgrim
in
the
business
dan
faced
bassett
as
he
made
this
explanation
and
he
was
conscious
as
he
turned
toward
the
master
of
the
house
that
bassett
was
observing
him
intently
his
gaze
was
so
direct
and
searching
that
harwood
was
disconcerted
for
a
moment
then
bassett
remarked
carelessly
i
should
think
newspaper
work
a
good
training
for
the
law
it
drills
faculties
that
a
lawyer
exercises
constantly
bassett
now
made
it
possible
for
marian
and
young
blackford
to
contribute
to
the
conversation
i
going
to
annapolis
announced
the
boy
you
had
a
change
of
heart
said
his
father
with
a
smile
it
was
west
point
last
week
well
it
will
be
annapolis
next
week
the
lad
declared
and
then
as
if
to
explain
his
abandonment
of
a
military
career
in
the
navy
you
get
to
see
the
world
and
in
the
army
you
likely
to
be
stuck
away
at
some
awful
place
on
the
plains
where
you
never
see
anything
the
indians
are
nearly
all
killed
anyhow
we
hear
a
good
deal
nowadays
about
the
higher
education
of
woman
bassett
remarked
and
i
suppose
girls
should
be
prepared
to
earn
their
own
living
mothers
of
daughters
have
that
to
think
about
miss
marian
catching
dan
eye
smiled
as
though
to
express
her
full
appreciation
of
the
humor
of
her
mother
remark
mama
learned
that
from
my
aunt
sally
she
ventured
and
dan
saw
that
she
was
an
independent
spirit
given
to
daring
sayings
and
indulged
in
them
by
her
parents
well
aunt
sally
is
the
wisest
woman
in
the
world
replied
bassett
with
emphasis
it
would
be
to
your
credit
if
you
followed
her
my
dear
marian
ignored
her
mother
rebuke
and
addressed
herself
to
the
visitor
aunt
sally
lives
in
indianapolis
and
i
go
there
to
miss
school
i
just
home
for
sunday
owen
is
my
aunt
you
may
have
heard
of
her
harwood
she
was
my
father
only
sister
oh
owen
of
course
every
one
has
heard
of
her
and
i
knew
that
she
was
senator
singleton
sister
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
do
know
her
unconsciously
the
sense
of
morton
bassett
importance
deepened
in
marrying
jackson
owen
niece
bassett
had
linked
himself
to
the
richest
woman
at
the
state
capital
he
had
not
encumbered
himself
with
a
crude
wife
from
the
countryside
but
had
married
a
woman
with
important
connections
blackford
singleton
had
been
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
state
and
owen
his
sister
was
not
a
negligible
figure
in
the
background
against
which
the
reporter
saw
he
must
sketch
the
fraserville
senator
harwood
had
met
the
wives
of
other
hoosier
statesmen
uninteresting
creatures
in
the
main
and
palpably
of
little
assistance
to
ambitious
husbands
it
appeared
that
the
bassetts
spent
their
summers
at
their
cottage
on
lake
waupegan
and
that
owen
had
a
farm
near
them
it
was
clear
that
bassett
enjoyed
his
family
he
fell
into
a
chaffing
way
with
his
children
and
laughed
heartily
at
marian
forwardness
he
met
his
son
on
the
lad
own
note
of
and
connived
with
him
to
provoke
her
amusing
impertinences
bassett
imposed
no
restrictions
upon
harwood
pencil
and
this
too
was
a
novel
experience
his
predecessors
on
the
list
of
leaders
in
hoosier
politics
had
not
been
backward
about
making
suggestions
but
bassett
did
not
refer
to
harwood
errand
at
all
when
dan
asked
for
photographs
of
bassett
and
the
children
with
which
to
embellish
his
article
bassett
declined
to
give
them
with
a
firmness
that
ended
the
matter
but
he
promised
to
provide
photographs
of
the
house
and
grounds
and
of
the
waupegan
cottage
and
send
them
to
harwood
in
a
day
or
two
harwood
gave
to
his
sketch
of
morton
bassett
a
care
which
he
had
not
bestowed
upon
any
of
his
previous
contributions
to
the
courier
series
of
hoosier
statesmen
he
remained
away
from
the
law
office
two
days
the
better
to
concentrate
himself
upon
his
task
and
the
result
was
a
careful
straightforward
article
into
which
he
threw
shadings
of
analysis
and
flashes
of
color
that
reflected
very
faithfully
the
impression
made
upon
his
mind
by
the
senator
from
fraser
the
managing
editor
complained
of
its
sobriety
and
lack
of
anecdote
it
good
harwood
but
it
too
damned
solemn
ca
you
shoot
a
little
ginger
into
it
i
tried
to
paint
the
real
bassett
he
is
one
of
these
raw
hayseeds
who
hands
you
chestnuts
out
of
patent
medicine
almanacs
tried
to
make
a
document
that
would
tell
the
truth
and
at
the
same
time
please
him
why
snapped
the
editor
pulling
the
green
shade
away
from
his
eyes
and
glaring
at
the
reporter
because
he
the
sort
of
man
you
feel
you
like
to
please
he
the
only
one
of
these
fellows
i
tackled
who
did
tell
me
a
lot
of
highfalutin
rot
they
wanted
put
into
the
article
bassett
did
seem
to
care
about
it
one
way
or
another
i
rewrote
most
of
that
stuff
half
a
dozen
times
to
be
sure
to
get
the
punk
out
of
it
because
i
knew
he
hated
punk
you
did
did
you
well
mcnaughton
of
tippecanoe
county
is
the
next
you
to
tackle
and
you
need
be
afraid
to
pin
ribbons
on
him
you
college
fellows
are
all
alike
try
to
remember
harwood
that
this
paper
ai
the
american
review
it
a
newspaper
for
the
plain
people
dan
at
some
personal
risk
saw
to
it
that
the
illustrations
were
so
minimized
that
it
became
unnecessary
to
sacrifice
his
text
to
accommodate
it
to
the
page
set
apart
for
it
he
read
his
screed
in
type
with
considerable
satisfaction
feeling
that
it
was
an
honest
piece
of
work
and
that
it
limned
a
portrait
of
bassett
that
was
vivid
and
truthful
the
inquired
who
had
written
it
and
took
occasion
to
commend
harwood
for
his
good
workmanship
a
little
later
a
clerk
in
the
told
him
that
bassett
had
ordered
a
hundred
copies
of
the
issue
containing
the
sketch
and
this
was
consoling
several
other
subjects
had
written
their
thanks
and
dan
had
rather
hoped
that
bassett
would
send
him
a
line
of
approval
but
on
reflection
he
concluded
that
it
was
not
like
bassett
to
do
so
and
that
this
failure
to
make
any
sign
corroborated
all
that
he
knew
or
imagined
of
the
senator
from
fraser
chapter
vii
sylvia
at
lake
waupegan
the
snow
lay
late
the
next
year
on
the
madison
campus
it
had
been
a
busy
winter
for
sylvia
though
in
all
ways
a
happy
one
when
it
became
known
that
she
was
preparing
for
college
all
the
buckeye
lane
folk
were
anxious
to
help
professor
kelton
would
not
trust
his
own
powers
too
far
and
he
availed
himself
of
the
offers
of
members
of
the
faculty
to
tutor
sylvia
in
their
several
branches
buckeye
lane
was
proud
of
sylvia
and
glad
that
the
old
professor
found
college
possible
for
her
happiness
reigned
in
the
cottage
and
days
were
not
so
cold
or
snows
so
deep
but
that
sylvia
and
her
grandfather
went
forth
for
their
afternoon
tramp
there
was
nothing
morbid
or
anæmic
about
sylvia
every
morning
she
pulled
weights
and
swung
indian
clubs
with
her
windows
open
a
mischievous
freshman
who
had
thrown
a
snowball
at
sylvia
heels
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
jump
regretted
his
bad
manners
sylvia
caught
him
in
the
ear
with
an
unexpected
return
shot
a
senior
who
observed
the
incident
dealt
in
the
lordly
way
of
his
kind
with
the
offender
they
called
her
our
and
the
boss
girl
after
that
the
professor
of
mathematics
occasionally
left
on
his
blackboard
sylvia
demonstrations
and
pointed
them
out
to
his
class
as
models
worthy
of
their
emulation
spring
stole
into
the
heart
of
the
wabash
country
and
the
sap
sang
again
in
maples
and
elms
lilacs
and
snowballs
bloomed
and
professor
kelton
went
serenely
about
among
his
roses
sylvia
passed
her
examinations
and
was
to
be
admitted
to
wellesley
without
conditions
all
the
lane
knew
and
rejoiced
the
good
news
was
communicated
to
owen
who
wrote
at
once
to
professor
kelton
from
the
summer
headquarters
she
had
established
on
her
farm
in
northern
indiana
that
just
then
required
particular
attention
it
ran
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
visit
sylvia
must
be
pretty
tired
after
her
long
busy
year
and
i
have
been
tinkering
the
house
here
a
little
bit
so
you
can
both
be
perfectly
comfortable
it
not
so
lonely
as
you
might
think
as
my
farm
borders
lake
waupegan
and
the
young
people
have
gay
times
my
niece
bassett
has
a
cottage
on
the
lake
only
a
minute
walk
from
me
i
should
like
marian
and
sylvia
to
get
acquainted
and
this
will
be
easy
if
only
you
will
come
up
for
a
couple
of
weeks
there
are
enough
old
folks
around
here
andrew
to
keep
you
and
me
in
countenance
i
inclose
a
timetable
with
the
best
trains
marked
you
leave
the
train
at
waupegan
station
and
take
the
steamer
across
the
lake
i
will
meet
you
at
any
time
you
say
so
it
happened
that
on
a
june
evening
they
left
the
train
at
waupegan
and
crossed
the
platform
to
the
wheezy
little
steamer
which
was
waiting
just
as
the
timetable
had
predicted
and
soon
they
were
embarked
and
crossing
the
lake
which
seemed
to
sylvia
a
vast
ocean
twilight
was
enfolding
the
world
and
all
manner
of
fairy
lights
began
to
twinkle
at
the
far
edges
of
the
water
and
on
the
dark
heights
above
the
lake
overhead
the
stars
were
slipping
into
their
wonted
places
you
can
get
an
idea
of
how
it
is
at
sea
said
her
grandfather
smiling
at
her
long
upward
gaze
only
you
can
hardly
feel
the
wonder
of
it
all
here
or
the
great
loneliness
of
the
ocean
at
night
it
was
however
wonder
enough
for
a
girl
who
had
previously
looked
upon
no
more
impressive
waters
than
those
of
fall
creek
sugar
creek
and
white
river
the
steamer
with
much
sputtering
and
churning
and
not
without
excessive
trepidation
on
the
part
of
the
captain
and
his
lone
deck
hand
stopped
at
many
frail
docks
below
the
cottages
that
hung
on
the
bluff
above
every
cottager
maintained
his
own
light
or
combination
of
lights
to
facilitate
identification
by
approaching
visitors
they
passed
a
number
of
sailboats
lazily
idling
in
the
light
wind
and
several
small
power
boats
shot
past
with
engines
beating
furiously
upon
the
still
waters
the
bassetts
dock
is
the
green
light
the
red
white
and
blue
is
owen
explained
the
captain
we
ai
stoppin
at
these
lights
marked
the
farthest
bounds
of
lake
waupegan
and
were
the
last
points
touched
by
the
boat
sylvia
watched
the
green
light
with
interest
as
they
passed
she
had
thought
of
marian
often
since
their
meeting
at
owen
she
would
doubtless
see
more
of
her
now
the
green
light
and
the
red
white
and
blue
were
very
close
together
owen
called
to
them
cheerily
from
the
dock
and
waved
a
lantern
in
welcome
she
began
talking
to
her
guests
before
they
disembarked
glad
to
see
you
andrew
you
must
be
mighty
hungry
sylvia
do
smash
my
dock
to
pieces
captain
it
only
wood
owen
complained
after
a
few
days
that
she
saw
nothing
of
sylvia
so
numerous
were
that
young
person
engagements
bassett
and
marian
called
promptly
the
former
a
trifle
dazed
by
sylvia
sudden
advent
and
marian
genuinely
cordial
bassett
had
heard
of
the
approaching
visit
with
liveliest
interest
a
year
before
when
marian
had
reported
the
presence
in
owen
house
at
indianapolis
of
a
strange
girl
with
professor
kelton
her
curiosity
had
been
piqued
but
she
soon
dismissed
the
matter
marian
had
carried
home
little
information
and
while
bassett
saw
her
aunt
often
on
her
frequent
excursions
to
the
city
she
knew
by
long
experience
that
owen
did
not
yield
gracefully
to
prodding
bassett
had
heard
all
her
life
of
professor
kelton
and
she
had
met
him
now
and
then
in
the
delaware
street
house
but
her
knowledge
of
him
and
his
family
was
only
the
most
fragmentary
nothing
had
occurred
during
the
year
to
bring
the
keltons
again
to
her
attention
but
now
with
a
casualness
in
itself
disconcerting
they
had
arrived
at
owen
farmhouse
where
bassett
was
sure
no
guests
had
ever
been
entertained
before
the
house
had
just
been
remodeled
and
made
altogether
habitable
a
fact
which
bassett
had
been
flattering
herself
argued
for
owen
increasing
interest
in
herself
and
her
family
the
immediate
arrival
of
the
keltons
was
disquieting
through
most
of
her
life
hallie
bassett
had
assumed
that
she
and
her
children
as
sally
owen
next
of
kin
quite
filled
the
heart
of
that
admirable
though
often
inexplicable
woman
bassett
had
herself
inherited
a
small
fortune
from
her
father
blackford
singleton
owen
brother
a
judge
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
a
senator
in
congress
whose
merits
and
services
are
set
forth
in
a
tablet
at
the
portal
of
the
fraser
county
the
bassetts
and
the
singletons
had
been
early
settlers
of
that
region
and
the
marriage
of
hallie
singleton
to
morton
bassett
was
a
satisfactory
incident
in
the
history
of
both
families
six
years
of
bassett
girlhood
had
been
passed
in
washington
the
thought
of
power
and
influence
was
dear
to
her
and
nothing
in
her
life
had
been
more
natural
than
the
expectation
that
her
children
would
enjoy
the
fortune
owen
had
been
accumulating
so
long
and
from
all
accounts
by
processes
hardly
less
than
magical
bassett
humor
was
not
always
equal
to
the
strain
to
which
her
aunt
subjected
it
hallie
bassett
had
in
fact
little
humor
of
any
sort
she
viewed
life
with
a
certain
austerity
and
in
literature
she
had
fortified
herself
against
the
shocks
of
time
conduct
she
had
read
is
three
fourths
of
life
and
wordsworth
had
convinced
her
that
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
bassett
discussed
nothing
so
ably
as
a
vague
something
she
was
fond
of
characterizing
as
the
full
life
and
this
she
wished
to
secure
for
her
children
her
boy
future
lay
properly
with
his
father
she
had
no
wish
to
meddle
with
it
but
marian
was
the
apple
of
her
eye
and
she
was
striving
by
all
the
means
in
her
power
to
direct
her
daughter
into
pleasant
paths
and
bright
meadows
where
the
full
life
is
assured
hers
were
no
mean
standards
she
meant
to
be
a
sympathetic
and
helpful
wife
the
wisest
and
most
conscientious
of
mothers
bassett
was
immensely
anxious
to
please
her
aunt
in
all
ways
but
that
intrepid
woman
pleasure
was
not
a
thing
to
be
counted
on
with
certainty
she
not
only
sought
to
please
her
aunt
by
every
means
possible
but
she
wished
her
children
to
intrench
themselves
strongly
in
their
great
aunt
favor
the
reports
of
such
of
owen
public
benefactions
as
occasionally
reached
the
newspapers
were
always
alarming
no
one
ever
knew
just
how
much
money
sally
owen
gave
away
but
some
of
her
gifts
in
recent
years
had
been
too
large
to
pass
unnoticed
by
the
press
only
a
few
months
before
she
had
established
a
home
in
memory
of
a
daughter
her
only
child
who
had
died
in
early
youth
and
this
crash
from
a
clear
sky
had
aroused
in
bassett
the
gravest
apprehensions
it
was
just
so
much
money
said
to
be
eighty
thousand
dollars
out
of
the
pockets
of
marian
and
blackford
and
besides
bassett
held
views
on
this
type
of
benevolence
homes
for
might
be
well
enough
but
the
danger
of
spoiling
them
by
too
much
indulgence
was
not
inconsiderable
bassett
altruism
was
directed
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
uplift
of
the
mass
she
never
said
masses
and
was
not
concerned
with
the
plain
prose
of
housing
feeding
and
clothing
young
women
who
earned
their
own
living
owen
in
turning
over
this
home
to
a
board
of
trustees
had
stipulated
that
music
for
dancing
should
be
provided
every
saturday
evening
whereupon
two
trustees
on
whom
the
christian
religion
weighed
heavily
resigned
but
owen
did
not
care
particularly
trustees
were
only
necessary
to
satisfy
the
law
and
to
assure
the
legal
continuity
of
elizabeth
house
which
owen
directed
very
well
herself
bassett
encouraged
marian
attentions
to
owen
young
visitor
but
it
must
be
said
that
marian
on
her
own
account
liked
sylvia
and
found
delight
in
initiating
her
into
the
mysteries
of
waupegan
life
she
taught
her
to
ride
to
paddle
a
canoe
and
to
swim
there
were
dances
at
the
casino
and
it
was
remarkable
how
easily
sylvia
learned
to
dance
marian
taught
her
a
few
steps
on
the
first
rainy
day
at
the
bassett
house
and
thereafter
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
sylvia
had
been
to
with
the
boys
and
girls
she
met
at
the
casino
parties
marian
was
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
summer
colony
and
sylvia
admired
her
ungrudgingly
in
all
outdoor
sports
marian
excelled
she
dived
from
a
like
a
boy
she
paddled
a
canoe
tirelessly
and
with
inimitable
grace
and
it
was
a
joy
to
see
her
at
the
tennis
court
where
her
nimbleness
of
foot
and
the
certainty
of
her
stroke
made
her
easily
first
in
all
competitions
at
the
casino
after
a
hard
round
of
tennis
and
while
waiting
for
cakes
and
lemonade
to
be
served
she
would
hammer
ragtime
on
the
piano
or
sing
the
latest
lyrical
offerings
of
broadway
quiet
elderly
gentlemen
from
cincinnati
louisville
and
indianapolis
who
went
to
the
casino
to
read
the
newspapers
or
to
play
bridge
grinned
when
marian
turned
things
upside
down
if
any
one
else
had
improvised
a
of
bottles
and
on
the
veranda
they
would
have
complained
of
it
bitterly
she
was
impatient
of
restraint
and
it
was
apparent
that
few
restraints
were
imposed
upon
her
her
sophistication
in
certain
directions
was
to
sylvia
incomprehensible
in
matters
of
personal
adornment
for
example
the
younger
girl
accomplishments
were
astonishing
she
taught
sylvia
how
to
arrange
her
hair
in
the
latest
fashion
promulgated
by
vogue
she
instructed
her
in
the
refined
art
of
manicuring
according
to
the
method
of
the
best
shop
in
indianapolis
and
it
was
amazing
how
wonderfully
marian
could
improve
a
hat
by
the
slightest
readjustments
of
ribbon
and
feather
she
tested
the
resources
like
a
spoiled
princess
with
an
indulgent
chancellor
to
pay
her
bills
she
gave
a
party
and
ordered
the
refreshments
from
chicago
though
her
mother
protested
that
the
domestic
apparatus
for
making
was
wholly
adequate
for
the
occasion
when
she
wanted
new
tennis
shoes
she
telegraphed
for
them
and
she
kept
in
her
room
a
small
library
of
catalogues
to
facilitate
her
extravagances
marian
talked
a
great
deal
about
boys
and
confided
to
sylvia
her
sentimental
attachment
for
one
of
the
lads
they
saw
from
day
to
day
and
with
whom
they
played
tennis
at
the
casino
court
for
the
first
time
sylvia
heard
a
girl
talk
of
men
as
of
romantic
beings
and
of
love
as
a
part
of
the
joy
and
excitement
of
life
a
young
gentleman
in
a
gibson
drawing
which
she
had
torn
from
an
old
copy
of
life
more
nearly
approximated
marian
ideal
than
even
the
actors
of
her
remote
adoration
she
had
a
great
number
of
gowns
and
was
quite
reckless
in
her
use
of
them
she
tried
to
confer
upon
sylvia
scarf
pins
ties
and
like
articles
for
which
she
declared
she
had
not
the
slightest
use
in
the
purchase
of
soda
water
and
candy
at
the
casino
where
she
scribbled
her
father
initials
on
the
checks
or
at
the
confectioner
in
the
village
where
she
enjoyed
a
flexible
credit
her
generosity
was
prodigal
she
was
constantly
picking
up
other
youngsters
and
piloting
them
on
excursions
that
her
ready
fancy
devised
and
if
they
returned
late
for
meals
or
otherwise
incurred
parental
displeasure
to
marian
it
was
only
part
of
the
joke
she
was
always
late
and
ingeniously
plausible
in
excusing
herself
mother
wo
bother
she
wants
me
to
have
a
good
time
and
when
papa
is
here
he
just
laughs
at
me
papa
just
the
best
ever
bassett
kept
lamenting
to
professor
kelton
her
husband
protracted
delay
in
colorado
he
was
interested
in
a
mining
property
there
and
was
waiting
for
the
installation
of
new
machinery
but
she
expected
to
hear
that
he
had
left
for
indiana
at
any
time
and
he
was
coming
direct
to
waupegan
for
a
long
stay
owen
was
busy
with
the
waupegan
farm
and
with
the
direction
of
her
farms
elsewhere
on
the
veranda
of
her
house
one
might
frequently
hear
her
voice
raised
at
the
telephone
as
she
gave
orders
to
the
men
in
charge
of
her
properties
in
central
and
southern
indiana
her
hearing
was
perfect
and
she
derived
the
greatest
satisfaction
from
telephoning
she
sold
stock
or
produce
on
these
distant
estates
with
the
market
page
of
the
courier
propped
on
the
telephone
desk
before
her
and
explained
her
transactions
zestfully
to
professor
kelton
and
sylvia
she
communicated
frequently
with
the
superintendent
of
her
horse
farm
at
lexington
about
the
string
she
expected
to
send
forth
to
triumph
at
county
and
state
fairs
the
annual
stud
register
lay
beside
the
bible
on
the
table
and
the
western
horseman
mingled
amicably
with
the
congregationalist
in
the
newspaper
rack
the
presence
of
the
old
professor
and
his
granddaughter
at
waupegan
continued
to
puzzle
bassett
owen
clearly
admired
sylvia
and
sylvia
was
a
charming
girl
there
was
no
gainsaying
that
at
the
farmhouse
a
good
deal
had
been
said
about
sylvia
plans
for
going
to
college
owen
had
proudly
called
attention
to
them
to
her
annoyance
if
sylvia
advent
marked
the
flowering
in
owen
of
some
new
ideals
of
woman
development
bassett
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
to
discover
them
and
to
train
marian
along
similar
lines
she
felt
that
her
husband
would
be
displeased
if
anything
occurred
to
thwart
the
hand
of
destiny
that
had
so
clearly
pointed
to
marian
and
blackford
as
the
natural
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
which
owen
by
due
process
of
nature
must
relinquish
in
all
her
calculations
for
the
future
owen
fortune
was
an
integer
bassett
received
a
letter
from
her
husband
on
saturday
morning
in
the
second
week
of
sylvia
stay
its
progress
from
the
in
the
mountains
had
been
slow
and
the
boat
that
delivered
the
letter
brought
also
a
telegram
announcing
bassett
arrival
in
chicago
so
that
he
was
even
now
on
his
way
to
waupegan
as
bassett
pondered
this
intelligence
sylvia
appeared
at
the
veranda
steps
to
inquire
for
marian
she
has
come
down
yet
sylvia
you
girls
had
a
pretty
lively
day
yesterday
and
i
told
marian
she
had
better
sleep
a
while
longer
we
certainly
have
the
finest
times
in
the
world
replied
sylvia
it
does
seem
possible
that
i
been
here
nearly
two
weeks
i
glad
you
going
to
stay
longer
aunt
sally
told
me
yesterday
it
was
arranged
we
really
did
expect
to
stay
more
than
our
two
weeks
but
owen
made
it
seem
very
easy
to
do
so
oh
you
need
be
afraid
of
outstaying
your
welcome
it
not
aunt
sally
way
to
bore
herself
if
she
did
like
you
very
much
she
would
have
you
here
at
all
aunt
sally
always
right
straight
out
from
the
shoulder
marian
has
done
everything
to
give
me
a
good
time
i
want
you
to
know
i
appreciate
it
i
have
never
known
girls
marian
is
really
the
first
girl
i
have
ever
known
and
she
has
taught
me
ever
so
many
things
marian
is
a
dear
murmured
bassett
she
was
a
murmurous
person
whose
speech
was
marked
by
a
curious
rising
inflection
that
turned
most
of
her
statements
into
interrogatories
to
sylvia
this
habit
seemed
altogether
wonderful
and
elegant
suppose
we
take
a
walk
along
the
lake
path
sylvia
we
can
pretend
we
looking
for
wild
flowers
to
have
an
excuse
i
leave
word
for
marian
to
follow
they
set
off
along
the
path
together
bassett
had
never
seemed
friendlier
and
sylvia
was
flattered
by
this
mark
of
kindness
bassett
trailed
her
parasol
using
it
occasionally
to
point
out
plants
and
flowers
that
called
for
comment
she
knew
the
local
flora
well
and
kept
a
daybook
of
the
wildflowers
found
in
the
longitude
and
latitude
of
waupegan
and
she
was
an
indefatigable
ornithologist
going
forth
with
notebook
and
opera
glass
in
hand
she
spoke
much
of
thoreau
and
burroughs
and
they
were
the
nucleus
of
her
summer
library
she
said
that
they
gained
tang
and
vigor
from
their
winter
hibernation
at
the
cottage
her
references
to
nature
were
a
little
as
seems
inevitable
with
such
devotees
but
we
can
not
belittle
the
accuracy
of
her
knowledge
or
the
cleverness
of
her
detective
skill
in
apprehending
the
native
flora
she
found
red
and
yellow
columbines
tucked
away
in
odd
corners
and
the
with
its
four
petals
two
blue
and
two
white
as
readily
as
sylvia
inexperienced
eye
discovered
the
more
obvious
and
bassett
rejoiced
in
the
discovery
of
the
season
first
puccoon
showing
its
cluster
on
a
sandy
slope
she
plucked
a
spray
of
the
spreading
dogbane
but
only
that
she
might
descant
upon
it
to
sylvia
it
was
a
crime
bassett
said
to
gather
wild
flowers
which
were
never
the
same
when
transplanted
to
the
house
when
they
came
presently
to
a
rustic
seat
bassett
suggested
that
they
rest
there
and
watch
the
lake
which
had
always
its
mild
excitements
you
have
known
aunt
sally
a
great
while
i
judge
sylvia
of
course
you
have
known
any
one
a
great
while
no
i
never
saw
her
but
once
before
this
visit
that
was
when
grandfather
took
me
to
see
her
in
indianapolis
a
year
ago
she
and
grandfather
are
old
friends
all
the
old
citizens
of
indiana
have
a
kind
of
friendship
among
themselves
somebody
said
once
that
the
difference
between
indiana
and
kentucky
is
that
while
the
kentuckians
are
all
cousins
we
hoosiers
are
all
neighbors
but
of
course
so
many
of
us
have
had
kentucky
grandfathers
that
we
understand
the
kentuckians
almost
as
well
as
our
own
people
i
used
to
meet
your
grandfather
now
and
then
at
aunt
sally
but
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
knew
him
he
a
delightful
man
and
it
plain
that
his
heart
is
centred
in
you
there
was
never
any
one
like
grandfather
said
sylvia
with
feeling
i
suppose
that
as
he
and
aunt
sally
are
such
old
friends
they
must
have
talked
a
good
deal
together
about
you
and
your
going
to
college
it
would
be
quite
natural
sylvia
had
not
thought
of
this
she
was
the
least
guileful
of
beings
this
sylvia
and
she
saw
nothing
amiss
in
these
inquiries
i
suppose
they
may
have
done
so
and
owen
talked
to
me
about
going
to
college
when
i
visited
her
oh
if
undertook
to
persuade
you
then
it
is
no
wonder
you
decided
to
go
she
a
very
powerful
pleader
as
she
would
put
it
herself
it
was
just
that
way
bassett
i
think
grandfather
had
already
persuaded
me
owen
did
know
of
it
till
afterward
but
she
seemed
to
like
the
idea
her
ideas
about
girls
and
women
are
very
interesting
yes
she
has
a
very
decided
way
of
expressing
herself
i
should
imagine
though
that
with
her
training
and
manner
of
life
she
might
look
a
little
warily
at
the
idea
of
college
training
for
women
personally
you
understand
i
am
heartily
in
favor
of
it
i
have
hoped
that
marian
might
go
to
college
aunt
sally
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
marian
naturally
but
she
has
never
urged
it
upon
us
sylvia
gazed
off
across
the
lake
and
made
no
reply
she
recalled
distinctly
owen
comments
on
marian
expressed
quite
clearly
on
the
day
of
their
drive
into
the
country
a
year
before
it
was
not
for
her
to
repeat
those
observations
she
liked
marian
and
admired
her
and
she
saw
no
reason
why
marian
should
not
go
to
college
sylvia
guessing
nothing
of
what
was
in
bassett
mind
failed
to
understand
that
owen
approval
of
marian
education
was
of
importance
nothing
could
have
been
more
remote
from
her
thoughts
than
the
idea
that
her
own
plans
concerned
any
one
but
herself
and
her
grandfather
she
was
not
so
dull
however
but
that
she
began
to
feel
that
bassett
was
speaking
defensively
of
marian
marian
taste
in
reading
is
very
unusual
i
think
i
have
always
insisted
that
she
read
only
the
best
she
is
very
fond
of
tennyson
i
fancy
that
after
all
home
training
is
really
the
most
valuable
i
mean
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
home
can
give
a
child
what
no
school
supplies
i
do
mean
of
course
that
we
have
it
in
home
but
i
speaking
of
the
ideal
condition
where
there
an
atmosphere
made
a
point
of
keeping
good
books
lying
about
the
house
and
the
best
magazines
and
reviews
i
was
never
happier
than
the
day
i
found
marian
curled
up
on
a
lounge
reading
keats
it
may
be
that
the
real
literary
instinct
such
as
i
feel
marian
has
would
only
be
spoiled
by
college
and
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
have
marian
become
a
writer
a
good
many
of
our
best
american
women
writers
have
not
been
college
women
i
was
looking
that
up
only
the
other
day
sylvia
listened
deeply
interested
then
she
laughed
suddenly
and
as
bassett
turned
toward
her
she
felt
that
it
would
do
no
harm
to
repeat
a
remark
of
owen
that
had
struck
her
as
being
funny
i
just
happened
to
remember
something
owen
said
about
colleges
she
said
that
if
it
is
in
the
colt
the
trainer
ca
put
it
there
and
i
suppose
the
successful
literary
women
have
had
genius
whether
they
had
higher
education
or
not
george
eliot
had
a
college
training
but
of
course
she
was
a
very
great
woman
bassett
compressed
her
lips
she
had
not
liked
this
quotation
from
owen
utterances
on
this
vexed
question
of
higher
education
could
it
be
possible
that
aunt
sally
looked
upon
marian
as
one
of
those
colts
for
whom
the
trainer
could
do
nothing
it
was
not
a
reassuring
thought
her
apprehensions
as
to
sylvia
place
in
her
kinswoman
affections
were
quickened
by
sylvia
words
but
bassett
dropped
the
matter
i
have
never
felt
that
young
girls
should
read
george
eliot
she
does
seem
to
me
an
ideal
to
set
before
a
young
girl
as
sylvia
knew
nothing
of
george
eliot
except
what
she
had
gleaned
from
the
biographical
data
in
a
on
writers
she
was
unable
to
follow
bassett
she
had
read
mill
on
the
floss
and
romola
and
saw
no
reason
why
every
one
should
enjoy
them
bassett
twirled
her
closed
parasol
absently
and
studied
the
profile
of
the
girl
beside
her
the
requirements
for
college
are
not
really
so
difficult
i
suppose
she
suggested
sylvia
dark
eyes
brightened
as
she
faced
her
interlocutor
those
of
us
who
know
sylvia
find
that
quick
flash
of
humor
in
her
eyes
adorable
oh
they
ca
be
for
i
answered
most
of
the
questions
she
exclaimed
and
then
seeing
no
response
in
her
inquisitor
she
added
soberly
it
all
set
out
in
the
catalogue
and
i
have
one
with
me
be
glad
to
bring
it
over
if
you
like
to
see
it
thank
you
sylvia
i
should
like
to
see
it
i
may
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
the
work
but
of
course
you
wo
say
anything
to
marian
of
our
talk
i
am
not
quite
sure
and
i
have
to
discuss
it
with
mr
bassett
of
course
i
sha
speak
of
it
mrs
bassett
marian
voice
was
now
heard
calling
them
down
the
path
and
the
girl
appeared
a
moment
later
munching
a
bit
of
toast
stuccoed
with
jam
and
eager
to
be
off
for
the
casino
where
a
tennis
match
was
scheduled
for
the
morning
do
be
late
for
dinner
this
evening
marian
your
father
will
be
here
and
if
you
see
blackford
be
sure
to
tell
him
to
meet
the
yes
mama
i
remember
and
i
try
to
meet
the
train
too
and
then
to
sylvia
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
boathouse
to
get
the
canoe
glad
dad
coming
he
perfectly
grand
and
i
going
to
see
if
he
wo
give
me
a
naphtha
launch
dad
a
good
old
scout
and
he
pretty
sure
to
do
it
marian
manner
of
speaking
of
her
parents
disclosed
the
filial
relationship
in
a
new
aspect
to
sylvia
who
did
not
at
once
reconcile
it
with
her
own
understanding
of
the
fifth
commandment
marian
referred
to
her
father
variously
as
the
grand
old
man
the
true
scout
sir
morton
the
good
knight
and
to
her
mother
as
the
princess
pauline
or
one
mama
giving
to
the
french
pronunciation
all
this
seemed
to
sylvia
to
be
in
keeping
with
marian
general
precociousness
sylvia
had
formed
the
habit
of
stealing
away
in
the
long
twilights
after
the
cheerful
gathering
at
owen
for
a
little
usually
owen
and
professor
kelton
fell
to
talking
of
old
times
and
old
friends
at
this
hour
and
sylvia
disappearances
were
unremarked
she
felt
the
joy
of
living
these
days
and
loved
dearly
the
delaying
hour
between
day
and
night
that
is
so
lovely
so
touched
with
poetry
in
this
region
there
was
always
a
robin
vesper
song
that
may
be
heard
elsewhere
than
in
indiana
but
can
nowhere
else
be
so
tremulous
with
joy
and
pain
a
little
creek
ran
across
owen
farm
cutting
for
itself
a
sharp
defile
to
facilitate
its
egress
into
the
lake
and
sylvia
liked
to
throw
herself
down
beside
a
favorite
maple
with
the
evening
breeze
whispering
over
the
young
corn
behind
her
and
the
lake
with
its
heart
open
to
the
coming
of
the
stars
quiet
before
her
and
dream
the
dreams
that
fill
a
girl
heart
in
those
blessed
and
wonderful
days
when
the
brook
and
river
meet
on
this
saturday
evening
sylvia
was
particularly
happy
the
activities
that
had
begun
late
left
her
a
little
breathless
she
was
wondering
whether
any
one
had
ever
been
so
happy
and
whether
any
other
girl
life
had
ever
been
so
pleasantly
ordered
her
heartbeat
quickened
as
she
thought
of
college
and
the
busy
years
that
awaited
her
there
and
after
that
would
come
the
great
world
doors
she
was
untouched
by
envy
hatred
or
malice
there
was
no
cloud
anywhere
that
could
mar
the
stars
that
stole
out
into
the
great
span
of
sky
were
not
more
tranquil
than
her
own
heart
the
world
existed
only
that
people
might
show
kindness
one
to
another
and
that
all
this
beauty
of
wood
field
water
and
starry
sky
might
bring
joy
to
the
souls
of
men
she
knew
that
there
was
evil
in
the
world
but
she
knew
it
from
books
and
not
from
life
her
path
had
fallen
in
pleasant
places
and
only
benignant
spirits
attended
her
she
was
roused
suddenly
by
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
path
beneath
this
twilight
sanctuary
had
never
been
invaded
before
and
she
rose
hastily
the
course
of
an
irregular
path
that
followed
the
lake
was
broken
here
by
the
creek
miniature
chasm
but
adventurous
pedestrians
might
gain
the
top
and
continue
over
a
rough
rustic
bridge
along
the
edge
of
owen
cornfield
sylvia
peered
down
expecting
to
see
marian
or
blackford
but
a
stranger
was
approaching
catching
at
bushes
to
facilitate
his
ascent
sylvia
stepped
back
assuming
it
to
be
a
cottager
who
had
lost
his
way
a
straw
hat
rose
above
the
elderberry
bushes
and
with
a
last
effort
the
man
stood
on
level
ground
panting
from
the
climb
he
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
face
as
he
glanced
about
sylvia
had
drawn
back
but
as
the
stranger
could
not
go
on
without
seeing
her
she
stepped
forward
and
they
faced
each
other
in
a
little
plot
of
level
ground
beside
the
defile
pardon
me
he
exclaimed
still
breathing
hard
and
then
his
eyes
met
hers
in
a
long
gaze
his
gray
eyes
searched
her
dark
ones
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
sylvia
hand
sought
the
maple
but
did
not
touch
it
and
the
keen
eyes
of
the
stranger
did
not
loosen
their
hold
of
hers
a
breeze
blowing
across
the
cornfield
swept
over
them
shaking
the
maple
leaves
and
rippled
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
dusk
deepening
slowly
seemed
to
shut
them
in
together
pardon
me
again
i
hope
i
did
frighten
you
i
am
bassett
marian
father
and
i
am
sylvia
garrison
i
am
staying
oh
he
laughed
you
need
tell
me
they
told
me
at
the
all
about
you
and
that
you
and
marian
are
fast
friends
i
knew
you
were
coming
they
were
speaking
of
it
this
morning
they
had
drawn
closer
together
during
this
friendly
exchange
again
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
then
he
surveyed
her
sharply
from
head
to
foot
as
he
stood
bareheaded
leaning
on
his
stick
i
must
be
going
said
sylvia
there
a
path
through
the
corn
that
owen
lets
me
use
they
begin
to
wonder
what
become
of
me
why
not
follow
the
path
to
the
lane
i
think
there
is
a
lane
at
the
edge
of
the
field
and
i
will
walk
to
the
house
with
you
the
path
through
the
corn
must
be
a
little
rough
and
it
growing
dark
yes
thank
you
mr
bassett
i
had
no
idea
of
meeting
any
one
when
i
came
out
i
usually
take
a
little
walk
after
supper
when
i
here
and
i
wanted
to
get
all
the
car
smoke
out
of
my
lungs
i
was
glad
to
get
out
of
chicago
it
was
fiercely
hot
there
the
path
was
not
wide
enough
for
two
and
she
walked
before
him
after
they
had
exhausted
the
heat
as
a
topic
silence
fell
upon
them
he
still
swung
his
hat
in
his
hand
once
or
twice
he
smote
his
stick
smartly
upon
the
ground
he
timed
his
pace
to
hers
keeping
close
his
eyes
upon
her
straight
slender
figure
when
they
reached
the
lane
they
walked
together
until
they
came
to
the
highway
which
they
followed
to
the
house
an
oil
lamp
marked
the
walk
that
led
through
owen
flower
garden
are
you
coming
in
mr
bassett
asked
sylvia
as
they
paused
her
hand
clicked
the
latch
and
the
little
gate
swung
open
in
the
lamplight
their
eyes
met
again
i
sorry
but
i
must
go
home
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
here
this
summer
and
my
stay
is
short
i
must
be
off
again
oh
that
too
bad
marian
has
been
telling
me
that
you
would
stay
a
month
she
will
be
terribly
disappointed
my
western
trip
took
more
time
than
i
expected
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
at
fraserville
and
must
get
back
there
she
stepped
inside
thinking
he
delayed
out
of
courtesy
to
her
but
to
her
surprise
he
fastened
the
latch
deliberately
and
lingered
they
tell
me
you
and
your
grandfather
live
at
montgomery
it
a
charming
town
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
state
yes
bassett
my
grandfather
taught
in
the
college
there
i
have
often
heard
of
professor
kelton
of
course
he
a
citizen
our
state
is
proud
of
bassett
says
you
going
to
college
this
fall
to
wellesley
is
it
bassett
has
an
idea
that
marian
ought
to
have
a
college
education
what
do
you
think
about
it
he
smiled
kindly
and
there
was
kindness
in
his
deep
voice
i
think
girls
should
go
who
want
to
go
answered
sylvia
her
hands
on
the
pickets
of
the
gate
you
speak
like
a
politician
laughed
bassett
that
exactly
what
i
think
and
i
have
seen
that
marian
is
dying
for
a
college
career
she
has
plenty
of
time
to
think
of
it
sylvia
replied
i
ever
so
much
older
and
this
seemed
to
dispose
of
that
matter
you
are
staying
here
some
time
another
week
it
seems
that
we
hardly
been
here
a
day
you
are
fortunate
in
having
owen
for
a
friend
she
is
a
very
unusual
woman
the
most
wonderful
person
i
ever
knew
responded
sylvia
warmly
he
still
showed
no
haste
to
leave
her
though
he
had
just
reached
waupegan
and
was
going
away
the
next
day
your
grandfather
is
teaching
at
madison
now
i
believe
no
but
he
lectures
sometimes
and
he
has
taught
me
there
was
never
a
better
teacher
she
answered
smiling
you
must
have
been
well
taught
if
you
are
ready
for
college
so
early
you
are
you
say
you
older
than
marian
do
you
mind
my
asking
how
old
you
are
nearly
seventeen
seventeen
in
october
oh
then
you
are
four
years
older
than
marian
but
i
must
keep
you
here
please
remember
me
to
owen
and
tell
her
i
drop
in
before
i
go
he
bent
over
the
gate
and
put
out
his
hand
miss
garrison
sylvia
had
never
been
called
miss
garrison
before
and
it
was
not
without
trepidation
that
she
heard
herself
so
addressed
bassett
had
spoken
the
name
gravely
and
their
eyes
met
again
in
lingering
contact
when
the
door
closed
upon
her
he
walked
on
rapidly
but
once
before
the
trees
had
obscured
owen
lights
he
turned
and
glanced
back
chapter
viii
silk
stockings
and
blue
overalls
one
night
in
this
same
june
harwood
was
directed
by
the
city
editor
of
the
courier
to
find
edward
thatcher
two
reporters
had
failed
at
it
and
it
was
desirable
to
verify
reports
as
to
certain
transactions
by
which
thatcher
in
conjunction
with
morton
bassett
was
believed
to
be
effecting
a
merger
of
various
interests
thatcher
had
begun
life
as
a
brewer
but
this
would
long
since
have
been
obscured
by
the
broadening
currents
of
fortune
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
persistent
dabbling
in
politics
whenever
the
republican
press
was
at
a
loss
for
something
to
attack
thatcher
breweries
which
he
had
concealed
in
a
corporation
that
did
not
bear
his
name
were
an
inviting
and
unfailing
target
for
years
though
never
seeking
office
he
had
been
a
silent
factor
in
politics
and
he
and
bassett
it
was
said
controlled
their
party
thatcher
had
built
an
expensive
house
but
fearing
that
the
money
her
husband
generously
supplied
was
tainted
by
the
remote
beer
vats
she
and
her
two
daughters
spent
most
of
their
time
in
europe
giving
however
as
their
reason
the
of
son
thatcher
income
was
large
and
he
spent
it
in
his
own
fashion
he
made
long
journeys
to
witness
prize
fights
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
poor
poker
player
but
a
good
loser
he
kept
a
that
lost
money
and
he
was
a
patron
of
baseball
and
owned
stock
in
the
local
club
he
was
a
good
fellow
in
a
sense
of
the
phrase
that
requires
quotation
marks
sally
owen
whose
opinion
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
her
fellow
citizens
is
not
to
be
slighted
fearlessly
asked
thatcher
to
dinner
at
her
house
she
expressed
her
unfavorable
opinion
of
his
family
for
deserting
him
and
told
him
to
his
face
that
a
man
who
knew
as
little
about
horses
as
he
did
should
have
a
guardian
he
in
town
somewhere
said
the
city
editor
do
come
back
and
tell
me
you
ca
find
him
try
the
country
club
where
he
was
never
known
to
go
and
the
university
club
where
he
does
belong
and
all
the
other
unlikely
places
you
can
think
of
the
other
boys
have
thrown
up
their
hands
dan
had
several
times
been
fortunate
in
like
quests
for
men
in
hiding
and
he
had
that
confidence
in
his
luck
which
is
part
of
the
good
reporter
endowment
he
called
all
the
clubs
and
the
thatcher
residence
by
telephone
the
clubs
denied
all
knowledge
of
edward
thatcher
and
his
residence
answered
not
at
all
whereupon
harwood
took
the
trolley
for
the
thatcher
mansion
in
the
new
quarter
of
meridian
street
beyond
the
peaceful
shores
of
fall
creek
a
humorist
who
described
the
passing
show
from
the
stern
of
a
wagon
for
the
instruction
of
tourists
announced
on
every
round
that
this
is
edward
residence
it
contains
twelve
and
cost
thousand
dollars
four
years
ago
the
family
have
lived
in
it
three
months
does
it
pay
to
be
rich
as
harwood
entered
the
grounds
the
house
loomed
darkly
before
him
most
of
the
houses
in
this
quarter
were
closed
for
the
summer
but
dan
assumed
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
caretaker
on
the
premises
and
he
began
patiently
punching
the
bell
failing
of
any
response
he
next
tried
a
side
door
and
finally
the
extreme
rear
he
had
begun
to
feel
discouraged
when
as
he
approached
the
front
entrance
for
a
second
assault
he
saw
a
light
flash
beyond
the
dark
blinds
the
door
opened
cautiously
and
a
voice
gruffly
bade
him
begone
i
have
a
message
for
thatcher
it
very
important
thatcher
not
at
home
nobody
home
growled
a
voice
in
broken
english
you
get
right
off
dis
place
quick
dan
thrust
his
into
the
small
opening
to
guard
against
having
the
door
slammed
in
his
face
and
began
a
parley
that
continued
for
several
minutes
with
rising
heat
on
the
part
of
the
caretaker
the
man
rage
at
being
unable
to
close
the
door
was
not
without
its
humor
but
dan
now
saw
beyond
the
german
broad
shoulders
a
figure
lurking
within
faintly
discernible
from
the
electric
lamps
in
a
bronze
sconce
on
the
wall
the
reporter
and
the
caretaker
were
making
no
progress
in
their
colloquy
and
dan
was
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
other
man
who
leaned
against
the
wall
quite
indifferent
to
the
struggle
for
the
door
dan
supposed
him
to
be
another
servant
and
he
had
abandoned
hope
of
learning
anything
of
thatcher
when
a
drawling
voice
called
out
open
the
door
hans
and
let
the
gentleman
in
i
attend
to
him
dan
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
a
slender
young
fellow
clad
in
blue
overalls
and
flannel
shirt
he
lounged
forward
with
an
air
of
languor
that
puzzled
the
reporter
his
dress
was
not
wholly
conclusive
as
to
his
position
in
the
silent
house
the
overalls
still
showed
their
pristine
folds
the
shirt
was
of
good
quality
and
the
ends
of
a
narrow
swung
free
he
was
save
for
an
absurd
little
mustache
so
fair
as
to
be
almost
indistinguishable
his
blond
hair
was
brushed
back
unparted
from
his
forehead
another
swift
survey
of
the
slight
figure
disclosed
a
pair
of
pumps
his
socks
revealed
at
the
ankles
were
scarlet
dan
was
unfamiliar
with
the
ménage
of
such
establishments
as
this
and
he
wondered
whether
this
might
not
be
an
upper
servant
of
a
new
species
peculiar
to
homes
of
wealth
he
leaned
on
his
stick
hat
in
hand
and
the
big
blue
eyes
of
the
young
man
rested
upon
him
with
disconcerting
gravity
a
door
slammed
at
the
rear
upon
the
retreating
german
whom
this
superior
functionary
had
dispatched
about
his
business
at
a
moment
when
the
silence
became
oppressive
the
young
man
straightened
himself
slightly
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
with
amusement
showing
clearly
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
lips
you
a
reporter
yes
i
from
the
i
looking
for
mr
thatcher
suppose
suppose
if
you
not
in
a
great
hurry
you
come
with
me
the
pumps
with
the
scarlet
socks
showing
below
the
overalls
turned
at
the
end
of
the
broad
hall
and
began
ascending
the
stairs
the
young
man
manner
was
perfectly
assured
he
had
not
taken
his
hands
from
his
pockets
and
he
carried
himself
with
an
ease
and
composure
that
set
dan
conjectures
at
naught
in
the
absence
of
the
family
a
servant
might
thus
conduct
himself
and
yet
if
thatcher
was
not
at
home
why
should
he
be
thus
ushered
into
the
inner
sanctities
of
the
mansion
by
this
singular
young
person
whose
silk
hose
and
bright
pumps
were
so
utterly
out
of
harmony
with
the
rest
of
his
garb
there
might
be
a
trick
in
it
perhaps
he
had
intruded
upon
a
burglarious
invasion
this
invitation
to
the
upper
chambers
might
be
for
the
purpose
of
shutting
him
in
somewhere
until
the
place
had
been
looted
it
was
in
any
case
a
novel
adventure
and
his
curiosity
was
aroused
by
the
languid
pace
with
which
without
pausing
at
the
second
floor
the
young
man
continued
on
to
the
third
through
an
open
door
dan
saw
a
bedroom
in
order
for
occupancy
but
the
furniture
in
the
upper
and
lower
halls
was
draped
and
a
faint
odor
of
camphor
hung
upon
the
air
it
had
occurred
to
harwood
that
he
might
be
stumbling
upon
material
for
a
good
story
though
just
what
it
might
prove
to
be
was
still
a
baffling
question
his
guide
had
not
spoken
or
looked
at
him
since
beginning
the
ascent
and
harwood
grasped
his
stick
more
firmly
when
they
gained
the
third
floor
if
violence
was
in
the
programme
he
meant
to
meet
it
gallantly
his
conductor
passed
through
a
spacious
bedroom
and
led
the
way
to
a
pleasant
and
with
walls
lined
with
books
without
pausing
he
flung
open
a
door
that
divulged
a
shop
with
a
bench
and
tools
the
litter
of
carpentry
on
the
bare
floor
testified
to
the
recent
use
sit
down
wo
you
and
have
a
cigar
dan
hesitated
he
felt
that
he
must
be
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
and
it
was
time
that
his
dignity
asserted
itself
he
had
accepted
a
cigar
and
was
holding
it
in
his
fingers
still
standing
his
strange
guide
struck
a
match
and
held
it
so
that
dan
perforce
took
advantage
of
the
proffered
flame
and
he
noticed
now
for
the
first
time
the
young
fellow
slender
nervous
hands
which
bore
no
marks
of
hard
toil
he
continued
to
watch
them
with
interest
as
they
found
and
filled
a
pipe
they
were
amazingly
deft
expressive
hands
have
a
chair
it
a
good
one
i
made
it
myself
with
this
the
young
gentleman
jumped
lightly
upon
the
workbench
where
he
nursed
his
knees
and
smoked
his
pipe
he
was
a
graceful
person
trimly
and
delicately
fashioned
and
in
this
strange
setting
altogether
inexplicable
but
dan
time
was
important
and
he
had
not
yet
learned
anything
as
to
edward
thatcher
whereabouts
this
languid
young
gentleman
seemed
wholly
indifferent
to
the
reporter
restlessness
and
dan
professional
pride
rebelled
pardon
me
but
i
must
see
thatcher
where
is
he
please
he
gone
skipped
no
manner
of
use
in
looking
for
him
on
my
honor
he
not
in
town
then
why
did
you
say
so
and
be
done
with
it
demanded
dan
angrily
please
keep
your
seat
replied
the
young
fellow
from
the
workbench
i
really
wish
you
would
he
drew
on
his
pipe
for
a
moment
and
dan
curiously
held
by
his
look
and
manner
and
arrested
by
the
gentleness
of
his
voice
awaited
further
developments
he
had
no
weapons
with
which
to
deal
with
this
composed
young
person
in
overalls
and
scarlet
hose
he
swallowed
his
anger
but
his
curiosity
now
clamored
for
satisfaction
may
i
ask
just
who
you
are
and
why
on
earth
you
brought
me
up
here
those
are
fair
questions
two
of
them
to
the
first
i
am
allen
thatcher
and
this
is
my
father
house
to
the
second
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
well
if
you
must
know
i
was
so
devilish
lonesome
he
gazed
at
harwood
quizzically
with
a
air
if
you
lonesome
thatcher
it
must
be
because
you
prefer
it
that
way
it
ca
be
necessary
for
you
to
resort
to
kidnapping
just
to
have
somebody
to
talk
to
i
thought
you
were
in
europe
nothing
as
bad
as
that
what
your
name
if
you
do
mind
when
dan
gave
it
thatcher
nodded
and
thanked
him
college
man
yale
that
altogether
bully
i
envy
you
by
george
you
see
he
went
on
easily
as
though
in
the
midst
of
a
long
and
intimate
conversation
they
took
me
abroad
and
it
never
really
counted
they
always
treated
me
as
though
i
were
an
invalid
and
kept
me
for
a
year
or
two
squatting
on
an
alp
on
account
of
my
lungs
it
amused
them
no
doubt
and
it
filled
in
my
time
till
i
was
too
old
to
go
to
college
but
now
that
grown
up
i
going
to
stay
at
home
i
been
here
a
month
having
a
grand
old
time
a
little
lonesome
and
yet
i
a
person
of
occupations
and
hans
cooks
enough
for
me
to
eat
i
have
been
down
town
much
but
nobody
knows
me
here
anyhow
dad
been
living
at
the
club
or
a
hotel
but
he
moved
up
here
to
be
with
me
dad
the
best
old
chap
on
earth
i
guess
he
liked
my
coming
back
they
rather
bore
him
i
fancy
we
had
a
bully
day
or
two
but
dad
has
skipped
gone
to
new
york
be
back
in
a
week
wanted
me
to
go
but
not
me
i
had
enough
travel
for
a
while
they
gave
me
a
dose
of
it
these
morsels
of
information
fell
from
him
carelessly
his
they
dan
assumed
referred
to
his
mother
and
sisters
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
and
young
thatcher
spoke
of
them
in
a
curiously
impersonal
and
detached
fashion
the
whimsical
humor
that
twinkled
in
his
eyes
occasionally
was
interesting
and
pleasing
and
dan
imagined
that
he
was
enjoying
the
situation
silk
socks
and
overalls
were
probably
a
part
of
some
whim
they
certainly
added
picturesqueness
to
the
scene
but
the
city
editor
must
be
informed
that
edward
g
thatcher
was
beyond
his
jurisdiction
and
dan
rose
and
moved
toward
the
door
allen
jumped
down
and
crossed
to
him
quickly
oh
i
say
i
really
wish
you
would
go
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
pleading
in
his
voice
and
manner
he
laid
a
hand
very
gently
on
dan
arm
but
i
got
to
get
back
downtown
if
your
father
has
really
gone
and
is
hidden
away
here
somewhere
i
cut
you
a
slice
right
out
of
the
eternal
truth
on
that
old
man
father
will
be
in
new
york
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
search
the
house
all
you
please
but
do
you
know
i
rather
like
you
to
believe
me
of
course
i
believe
you
but
it
odd
the
office
did
know
you
were
here
they
told
me
you
and
your
mother
and
sisters
were
abroad
but
that
your
father
was
in
town
a
personal
item
in
the
this
morning
said
that
you
were
all
in
the
hartz
mountains
i
dare
say
it
did
the
newspapers
keep
them
all
pretty
well
before
the
public
but
i
had
enough
junketing
i
going
to
stay
right
here
for
a
while
you
prefer
it
here
is
that
the
idea
yes
i
fancy
i
should
if
i
knew
it
i
want
to
know
it
but
i
all
kinds
of
crazy
you
know
they
really
think
i
clear
off
simply
because
their
kind
of
thing
does
amuse
me
i
lost
too
much
as
a
kid
being
away
from
home
they
said
i
had
to
be
educated
abroad
and
there
you
see
me
dresden
awhile
berlin
another
while
a
lot
of
geneva
and
paris
for
grand
sprees
and
my
lung
was
always
the
excuse
if
they
wanted
to
do
a
winter
on
the
nile
ugh
the
very
thought
of
egypt
makes
me
ill
now
it
all
sounds
pretty
grand
to
me
i
was
never
east
of
boston
in
my
life
by
jove
i
congratulate
you
exclaimed
the
young
man
fervidly
and
i
wager
that
you
went
to
school
at
a
and
rode
to
town
in
a
farm
wagon
to
see
a
circus
that
had
lions
and
elephants
and
you
probably
chopped
wood
and
broke
colts
and
went
swimming
in
an
old
and
did
all
the
other
things
you
read
about
in
american
biographies
and
story
books
i
can
see
it
in
your
eye
and
you
talk
like
it
too
i
dare
say
i
do
laughed
dan
they
always
told
me
that
my
voice
sounds
like
a
nutmeg
grater
they
filed
mine
off
mother
was
quite
strong
for
the
italian
and
i
afraid
i
caught
it
just
like
a
disease
i
should
call
it
a
pretty
good
case
i
was
admiral
of
a
canal
boat
in
new
jersey
one
summer
trying
to
earn
enough
money
to
carry
my
sophomore
year
in
college
and
cussing
the
mules
ruined
my
hope
of
a
reputable
accent
it
almost
spoiled
my
hoosier
dialect
by
george
i
wonder
if
the
people
would
take
me
it
would
be
less
lonesome
than
working
at
the
bench
here
dad
says
i
can
do
anything
i
like
he
tickled
to
death
because
i
come
home
really
the
right
sort
he
did
all
the
business
himself
ploughed
corn
wore
red
mittens
to
a
red
and
got
licked
with
a
hickory
stick
but
he
does
understand
why
i
either
take
a
job
in
his
office
or
gallop
the
paris
boulevards
with
mother
and
the
girls
but
he
all
right
we
great
pals
but
the
rest
of
them
made
a
row
because
i
came
home
for
a
while
they
had
breweries
as
an
excuse
for
keeping
away
and
my
lungs
dad
hid
the
breweries
so
their
hope
of
a
villa
at
sorrento
is
in
my
chest
dad
says
my
lungs
have
been
their
main
asset
there
really
nothing
the
matter
with
me
the
best
man
in
new
york
told
me
so
as
i
came
through
his
manner
of
speaking
of
his
family
was
deliciously
droll
he
yielded
his
confidences
as
artlessly
as
a
child
they
almost
got
a
steam
yacht
on
me
last
year
he
went
on
hired
a
vienna
doctor
to
say
i
ought
to
be
kept
at
sea
between
gibraltar
and
the
bosphorus
and
here
by
george
is
america
the
dear
bully
old
america
of
washington
franklin
andrew
jackson
and
abraham
lincoln
and
they
want
to
keep
me
chasing
around
among
ruins
and
tombs
i
say
to
you
harwood
in
all
solemnity
that
i
my
last
at
the
tombs
of
dead
kings
they
stood
near
the
shop
door
during
this
interchange
dan
forgot
in
his
increasing
interest
and
mystification
that
the
courier
city
editor
was
waiting
for
news
of
thatcher
the
capitalist
young
thatcher
narrative
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
protest
he
was
seriously
in
rebellion
against
his
own
expatriation
he
stood
erect
now
with
the
color
bright
in
his
cheeks
one
hand
thrust
into
his
pocket
the
other
clenching
his
pipe
i
tell
you
he
declared
i
missed
too
much
life
over
here
is
a
big
thing
it
wonderful
marvelous
grand
glorious
and
who
am
i
to
spend
winters
on
the
dead
old
nile
when
history
is
being
made
right
here
on
white
river
i
tell
you
i
want
to
watch
the
great
experiment
and
if
i
were
not
a
poor
worthless
ignorant
ass
i
be
a
part
of
it
dan
did
not
question
the
young
fellow
sincerity
his
glowing
eyes
and
the
voice
in
which
he
concluded
gave
an
authentic
stamp
to
his
lament
and
pronouncement
a
look
of
dejection
crossed
his
face
he
had
by
his
own
confession
asked
dan
into
the
house
merely
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
he
was
dissatisfied
unhappy
lonely
and
his
slender
figure
and
flushed
cheeks
supported
his
own
testimony
that
his
health
had
been
a
matter
of
concern
the
nile
and
the
alps
against
which
he
had
revolted
might
not
be
so
unnecessary
as
he
believed
the
situation
was
so
novel
that
harwood
mind
did
not
respond
with
the
promptness
of
his
heart
he
had
known
the
sons
of
rich
men
at
college
and
some
of
them
had
been
his
friends
it
was
quite
the
natural
and
accepted
order
of
things
that
some
children
should
be
born
to
sheltered
pampered
lives
while
others
were
obliged
to
hew
their
own
way
to
success
he
had
observed
in
college
that
the
sons
of
the
rich
had
a
pretty
good
time
of
it
but
he
had
gone
his
own
way
unenviously
it
was
not
easy
to
classify
young
thatcher
he
was
clearly
an
exotic
a
curious
pale
flower
with
healthy
roots
and
a
yearning
for
clean
free
air
dan
was
suddenly
conscious
that
the
young
fellow
eyes
were
bent
upon
him
with
a
wistfulness
a
kind
of
pleading
sweetness
that
the
reporter
had
no
inclination
to
resist
he
delayed
speaking
anxious
to
say
the
right
word
to
meet
the
plea
in
the
right
spirit
i
think
i
understand
i
believe
i
should
feel
just
as
you
do
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
it
mighty
interesting
this
whole
big
scheme
we
a
part
of
over
there
on
the
other
side
it
all
different
the
life
the
aims
and
the
point
of
view
and
here
we
got
just
what
you
call
it
the
most
wonderful
experiment
the
world
ever
saw
great
scott
he
exclaimed
kindling
from
the
spark
struck
by
thatcher
closing
words
it
prodigious
overwhelming
there
must
be
any
question
of
losing
that
right
broke
in
thatcher
eagerly
that
what
i
been
wanting
somebody
to
say
it
so
beautiful
so
wonderful
the
hope
and
promise
are
so
immense
you
believe
it
i
can
see
you
do
he
concluded
happily
his
hand
stole
shyly
from
the
pocket
that
seemed
to
be
its
inevitable
and
paused
uncertainly
then
he
thrust
it
out
smiling
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
let
us
be
old
friends
replied
dan
heartily
and
now
i
got
to
get
out
of
here
or
i
lose
my
job
then
i
should
have
to
get
you
another
i
never
meant
to
keep
you
so
long
you
been
mighty
nice
about
it
i
suppose
i
could
help
you
i
mean
about
dad
all
you
wanted
was
to
see
father
or
find
you
could
i
had
questions
to
ask
him
of
course
they
were
about
a
deal
with
bassett
oh
i
dare
say
they
bought
them
he
asked
me
if
i
did
want
to
go
into
the
glass
business
he
talks
to
me
a
lot
about
things
thinking
about
going
to
the
senate
dad
a
democrat
like
jefferson
and
jackson
if
he
goes
to
the
senate
i
have
a
chance
to
see
the
wheels
go
round
at
washington
perfectly
bully
for
me
harwood
grinned
at
the
youth
naïve
references
to
edward
political
ambitions
thatcher
was
known
as
a
wealthy
sport
and
dan
had
resented
his
meddling
in
politics
but
this
was
startling
news
that
thatcher
was
measuring
himself
for
a
senatorial
toga
you
better
be
careful
there
a
good
story
in
that
but
you
would
you
see
i
not
supposed
to
know
bassett
and
your
father
will
probably
pull
it
off
if
they
try
hard
enough
they
pulled
off
worse
things
if
you
interested
in
american
types
you
should
know
bassett
ever
see
him
allen
laughed
his
way
of
laughing
was
pleasant
there
was
a
real
bubbling
mirth
in
him
no
but
i
read
about
him
in
the
which
they
always
have
follow
them
about
i
do
know
why
it
must
be
that
it
helps
them
to
rejoice
that
they
are
so
far
away
from
home
but
i
always
used
to
read
it
over
there
i
suppose
to
see
how
much
fun
i
missed
and
at
a
queer
little
place
in
switzerland
where
we
were
staying
i
remember
because
our
landlord
had
the
drollest
wart
on
his
chin
a
copy
of
the
turned
up
on
a
rainy
day
and
i
read
it
through
a
sketch
of
bassett
tickled
me
because
he
seemed
so
real
i
felt
that
i
like
to
be
morton
bassett
myself
the
man
who
does
things
the
masterful
american
a
real
type
by
george
and
that
safe
filled
with
beautiful
bindings
fine
to
know
there
are
such
fellows
your
words
affect
me
strangely
i
wrote
the
piece
now
that
is
funny
allen
glanced
at
dan
with
frank
admiration
you
write
well
praise
from
sir
hubert
i
scribble
verses
myself
so
our
acquaintance
really
began
a
long
time
ago
it
must
have
been
last
october
that
we
were
at
that
place
yes
it
was
in
the
fall
sometime
it
pleasant
to
know
that
anything
printed
in
a
newspaper
is
ever
remembered
so
long
bassett
is
an
interesting
man
all
right
enough
it
must
be
bully
to
meet
men
like
that
the
men
who
have
a
hand
in
the
big
things
i
must
get
dad
to
introduce
me
i
suppose
you
know
everybody
he
ended
admiringly
they
retraced
their
steps
through
the
silent
house
and
down
to
the
front
door
continuing
their
talk
as
dan
turned
for
their
last
words
on
the
veranda
steps
he
acted
on
an
impulse
and
said
have
supper
with
me
night
we
wo
call
it
dinner
at
the
whitcomb
house
i
meet
you
in
the
lobby
at
six
the
honorable
state
committee
is
in
town
and
i
point
out
some
of
the
moulders
of
our
political
destiny
they
a
joy
to
the
eye
i
can
tell
you
allen
eager
acquiescence
his
stumbling
murmured
thanks
emphasized
dan
sense
of
the
forlorn
life
young
thatcher
had
described
so
the
old
boy
skipped
has
he
demanded
the
city
editor
well
that
one
on
us
who
put
you
on
i
kept
at
the
bell
until
the
door
opened
and
then
i
saw
thatcher
son
he
told
me
oh
the
family
idiot
let
you
in
did
he
then
there
no
telling
whether
it
true
or
not
he
nutty
that
fellow
did
know
he
was
here
i
believe
he
told
me
the
truth
his
father
on
his
way
to
new
york
well
that
sounds
definite
but
it
does
make
any
difference
now
we
just
had
a
tip
to
let
the
deal
alone
for
god
sake
keep
at
the
law
harwood
this
business
is
hell
the
city
editor
bit
a
fat
cigar
savagely
you
no
sooner
strike
a
good
thing
and
work
on
it
for
two
days
than
you
butt
into
a
dead
wall
what
no
there
nothing
more
for
you
chapter
ix
daniel
harwood
receives
an
offer
a
brief
note
from
morton
bassett
dated
at
fraserville
reached
harwood
in
july
in
five
lines
bassett
asked
dan
to
meet
him
at
the
whitcomb
house
on
a
day
and
hour
succinctly
specified
harwood
had
long
since
exhausted
the
list
of
hoosier
statesmen
selected
for
niches
in
the
courier
pantheon
after
his
visit
to
fraserville
he
had
met
bassett
occasionally
in
the
street
or
at
the
whitcomb
house
and
several
times
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
passing
through
the
reception
room
of
the
law
office
into
fitch
private
room
on
these
occasions
dan
was
aware
that
bassett
presence
caused
a
ripple
of
interest
to
run
through
the
office
the
students
in
the
library
generally
turned
from
their
books
to
speak
of
bassett
in
low
tones
and
wright
coming
in
from
a
journey
on
one
of
these
occasions
and
anxious
to
see
his
partner
forthwith
lifted
his
brow
and
said
oh
meaningfully
when
told
that
it
was
morton
bassett
who
engaged
the
time
of
the
junior
member
bassett
name
did
not
appear
in
the
office
records
to
dan
knowledge
nor
was
he
engaged
in
litigation
his
conferences
were
always
with
fitch
alone
and
they
were
sometimes
of
length
harwood
was
not
without
his
perplexities
these
days
his
work
for
the
courier
had
gradually
increased
until
he
found
that
his
time
for
study
had
diminished
almost
to
the
vanishing
point
the
home
acres
continued
unprofitable
and
he
had
since
leaving
college
devoted
a
considerable
part
of
his
earnings
to
the
relief
of
his
father
his
father
lack
of
success
was
an
old
story
and
the
sons
were
deficient
in
initiative
and
energy
dan
with
his
ampler
outlook
grudged
them
nothing
but
the
home
needs
were
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
disposition
of
his
own
time
he
had
now
a
regular
assignment
to
the
county
courts
and
received
a
salary
from
the
courier
he
was
usually
so
tired
at
the
end
of
his
day
work
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
settle
down
to
study
at
night
in
the
deserted
law
office
the
constant
variety
and
excitement
of
newspaper
work
militated
against
the
sober
pondering
of
legal
principles
and
dan
had
begun
to
realize
that
with
the
necessity
for
earning
money
hanging
over
him
his
way
to
the
bar
or
to
a
practice
if
he
should
qualify
himself
lay
long
and
bleak
before
him
dan
had
heard
much
of
morton
bassett
since
his
visit
to
fraserville
his
conviction
dating
from
the
fraserville
visit
that
bassett
was
a
man
of
unusual
character
destined
to
go
far
in
any
direction
in
which
he
chose
to
exert
his
energies
was
proved
by
bassett
growing
prominence
a
session
of
the
legislature
had
intervened
and
the
opposition
press
had
hammered
bassett
hard
the
democratic
minority
under
leadership
had
wielded
power
hardly
second
to
that
of
the
majority
bassett
had
introduced
into
state
politics
the
alliance
a
device
by
virtue
of
which
members
of
the
assembly
representing
favored
interests
cooperated
to
the
end
that
no
legislation
viciously
directed
against
railways
manufacturers
brewers
and
distillers
should
succeed
through
the
deplorable
violence
of
reformers
and
radicals
apparently
without
realizing
it
and
clearly
without
caring
greatly
bassett
was
thus
doing
much
to
destroy
the
party
alignments
that
had
in
earlier
times
nowhere
else
been
so
definitely
marked
as
in
indiana
partisan
editors
of
both
camps
were
glad
when
the
sessions
closed
for
it
had
been
no
easy
matter
to
defend
or
applaud
the
acts
of
either
majority
or
minority
so
easily
did
republicans
and
democrats
plot
together
at
neutral
campfires
it
had
not
been
so
in
those
early
years
when
oliver
morton
of
the
iron
mace
still
hobbled
on
crutches
harrison
and
hendricks
had
fought
no
straw
men
when
they
went
forth
to
battle
harwood
began
to
be
conscious
of
these
changes
which
were
wholly
irreconcilable
with
the
political
ideals
he
had
imbibed
from
sumner
at
yale
he
had
witnessed
several
political
conventions
of
both
parties
from
the
press
table
and
it
was
gradually
dawning
upon
him
that
politics
is
not
readily
expressed
in
academic
terminology
the
silver
lining
of
the
democratic
cloud
had
not
greatly
disturbed
morton
bassett
he
had
been
a
delegate
to
the
national
convention
of
but
not
conspicuous
in
its
deliberations
and
in
the
subsequent
turbulent
campaign
he
had
conducted
himself
with
an
admirable
discretion
he
was
a
member
of
the
state
committee
and
the
chairman
was
said
to
be
of
his
choosing
bassett
stood
for
party
regularity
and
deplored
the
action
of
those
democrats
who
held
the
schismatic
national
convention
at
indianapolis
and
nominated
the
palmer
and
buckner
ticket
on
a
platform
he
had
continued
to
reelect
himself
to
the
senate
without
trouble
and
waited
for
the
political
alchemists
of
his
party
to
change
the
silver
back
to
gold
the
tariff
was
after
all
the
main
issue
bassett
held
but
it
was
said
that
in
his
business
transactions
during
these
vexed
years
he
had
stipulated
gold
payment
in
his
contracts
this
was
never
proved
and
if
as
charged
he
voted
in
for
republican
presidential
electors
it
did
not
greatly
matter
when
a
considerable
number
of
other
hoosier
democrats
who
to
outward
view
were
virtuously
loyal
managed
to
run
with
both
hounds
and
hare
bassett
believed
that
his
party
would
regain
its
lost
prestige
and
come
into
power
again
meanwhile
he
prospered
in
business
and
wielded
the
democratic
minority
at
the
state
house
effectively
dan
presented
himself
punctually
at
the
whitcomb
house
where
bassett
with
his
bag
packed
sat
reading
a
magazine
he
wore
a
becoming
gray
suit
without
a
waistcoat
and
a
blue
négligé
shirt
with
a
turnover
collar
and
a
blue
tie
he
pulled
up
his
creased
trousers
when
he
sat
down
and
the
socks
thus
disclosed
above
his
tan
oxfords
proved
to
be
blue
also
his
manner
was
cordial
without
effusiveness
when
they
shook
hands
his
eyes
met
dan
with
a
moment
keen
searching
gaze
as
though
he
sought
to
affirm
at
once
his
earlier
judgment
of
the
young
man
before
him
i
glad
to
see
you
again
harwood
i
was
to
be
in
town
for
the
day
and
named
this
hour
knowing
i
should
be
free
i
supposed
you
were
taking
it
easy
at
lake
waupegan
i
remember
you
told
me
you
had
a
place
there
bassett
eyes
met
dan
quickly
then
he
answered
oh
i
ought
to
be
there
but
i
only
had
a
day
of
it
all
summer
i
had
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
colorado
on
some
business
and
when
i
struck
waupegan
i
found
that
matters
had
been
accumulating
at
home
and
i
only
spent
one
night
at
the
lake
but
i
feel
better
when
i
at
work
i
holding
waupegan
in
reserve
for
my
old
age
you
do
look
as
though
you
needed
a
vacation
remarked
dan
in
fact
you
look
as
though
you
had
one
the
colorado
sun
did
that
how
are
things
going
with
you
well
i
kept
busy
since
i
saw
you
in
fraserville
but
i
seem
doomed
to
be
a
newspaper
man
in
spite
of
myself
i
like
it
well
enough
but
i
think
i
told
you
i
started
out
with
some
hope
of
landing
in
the
law
yes
i
remember
i
afraid
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
too
good
a
reporter
that
sketch
you
wrote
of
me
proved
that
if
i
had
not
been
the
subject
of
it
i
should
be
tempted
to
say
that
it
showed
what
i
believe
they
call
the
literary
touch
bassett
liked
it
maybe
because
there
was
so
little
of
her
in
it
we
both
appreciated
your
nice
feeling
and
consideration
in
the
whole
article
well
just
how
are
you
coming
on
in
the
law
some
of
my
work
at
college
was
preliminary
to
a
law
course
and
i
have
done
all
the
reading
possible
in
wright
and
fitch
office
but
i
have
to
eat
and
the
takes
care
of
that
pretty
well
i
had
to
give
less
time
to
study
i
do
know
enough
to
be
able
to
command
a
position
as
law
clerk
there
are
many
pay
jobs
of
that
sort
in
a
town
like
this
i
suppose
that
true
assented
bassett
i
suppose
i
shall
always
regret
i
did
hang
on
at
the
law
but
i
had
other
interests
that
conflicted
but
i
a
member
of
the
bar
as
i
probably
told
you
at
fraserville
and
i
have
a
considerable
library
stored
away
that
laughed
dan
is
susceptible
of
two
interpretations
oh
i
do
mean
it
in
my
head
it
in
a
warehouse
in
fraserville
the
grimness
of
bassett
face
in
repose
was
an
effect
of
his
mustache
he
was
by
no
means
humorless
and
his
smile
was
pleasant
dan
felt
drawn
to
him
again
as
at
fraserville
here
was
a
man
who
stood
four
square
to
the
winds
undisturbed
by
the
cyclonic
outbursts
of
unfriendly
newspapers
in
spite
of
the
clashing
winter
at
the
state
house
and
all
he
had
heard
and
read
of
the
senate
leader
since
the
fraserville
visit
dan
opinion
of
bassett
stood
his
sturdy
figure
those
firm
masterful
hands
and
his
deep
serious
voice
all
spoke
for
strength
it
has
occurred
to
me
harwood
that
we
might
be
of
service
to
each
other
i
have
a
good
many
interests
you
may
have
gathered
that
i
am
a
very
practical
person
that
is
wholly
true
in
business
i
aim
at
success
i
did
start
out
in
life
to
be
a
failure
bassett
paused
a
moment
and
dan
nodded
it
was
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
that
such
should
be
every
man
hope
and
aim
but
bassett
continued
i
talking
to
you
frankly
i
not
often
mistaken
in
my
judgments
of
men
and
i
taken
a
liking
to
you
i
want
to
open
an
office
here
chiefly
to
have
a
quiet
place
from
which
to
keep
track
of
things
that
interest
me
fraserville
is
no
longer
quite
central
enough
and
i
down
here
a
good
deal
i
need
somebody
to
keep
an
office
open
for
me
been
looking
about
and
there
are
some
rooms
in
the
boordman
building
that
i
think
would
be
about
right
you
might
call
the
position
suggesting
a
private
secretaryship
as
i
should
want
you
to
take
charge
of
correspondence
make
appointments
scan
the
papers
and
keep
me
advised
of
the
trend
of
things
i
going
to
move
my
law
library
down
here
to
give
the
rooms
a
substantial
look
and
if
you
feel
like
joining
me
you
have
a
good
deal
of
leisure
for
study
then
when
you
ready
for
practice
i
may
be
in
a
position
to
help
you
you
will
have
a
salary
of
say
twelve
hundred
to
begin
with
but
you
can
make
yourself
worth
more
to
me
dan
murmured
a
reply
which
bassett
did
not
heed
your
visit
to
my
home
and
the
article
in
the
first
suggested
this
to
me
it
struck
me
that
you
understood
me
pretty
well
i
read
all
the
other
sketches
in
that
series
and
the
different
tone
in
which
you
wrote
of
me
gave
me
the
idea
that
you
had
tried
to
please
me
and
that
you
knew
how
to
do
it
how
does
the
proposition
strike
you
it
could
be
otherwise
than
gratifying
bassett
it
taken
my
breath
away
it
widens
all
my
horizons
i
have
been
questioning
my
destiny
lately
the
law
as
a
goal
had
been
drawing
further
away
and
this
mark
of
confidence
oh
that
point
the
confidence
will
have
to
be
mutual
i
am
a
person
and
have
no
confidants
but
of
necessity
you
will
learn
my
affairs
pretty
thoroughly
if
you
accept
my
offer
you
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
me
most
of
it
unflattering
you
have
heard
that
i
drive
hard
bargains
at
every
session
of
the
legislature
i
am
charged
with
the
grossest
corruption
there
are
men
in
my
own
party
who
are
bent
on
breaking
me
down
and
getting
rid
of
me
i
going
to
give
them
the
best
fight
i
can
put
up
i
ca
see
through
the
back
of
my
head
i
want
you
to
do
that
for
me
i
do
know
much
about
the
practical
side
of
politics
it
full
of
traps
i
never
seen
sprung
but
i
know
they
planted
to
be
perfectly
frank
it
because
you
inexperienced
that
i
want
you
i
would
trust
anybody
who
had
political
ambitions
of
his
own
or
who
had
mixed
up
in
any
of
these
local
squabbles
and
besides
you
a
gentleman
and
an
educated
man
and
that
counts
for
something
you
are
very
kind
and
generous
i
appreciate
this
more
than
i
can
tell
you
and
i
like
do
decide
about
it
now
i
rather
you
did
take
a
week
to
it
then
drop
me
a
line
to
fraserville
or
come
up
if
you
want
to
talk
further
thank
you
i
sha
want
so
much
time
in
any
event
i
appreciate
your
kindness
it
the
most
cheering
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
bassett
glanced
at
his
watch
he
had
said
all
he
had
to
say
in
the
matter
and
closed
the
subject
characteristically
here
a
little
thing
i
picked
up
a
copy
of
he
was
with
clair
you
know
and
practically
all
the
copies
of
the
book
were
burned
in
a
philadelphia
before
they
were
bound
you
will
notice
that
some
of
the
pages
are
slightly
singed
as
you
saw
at
my
house
i
interested
in
getting
hold
of
books
relating
to
the
achievements
of
the
western
pioneers
some
of
these
bald
unvarnished
tales
give
a
capital
idea
of
the
men
who
conquered
the
wilderness
they
had
the
real
stuff
in
them
those
fellows
he
took
the
battered
volume
a
pamphlet
clumsily
encased
in
boards
and
drew
his
hand
across
its
rough
sides
caressingly
another
of
my
jokes
on
the
state
library
the
librarian
told
me
never
find
a
copy
and
this
was
on
top
of
a
pile
of
trash
in
a
shop
right
here
in
this
town
it
cost
me
just
fifty
cents
he
snapped
his
bag
shut
on
the
treasure
and
bade
dan
without
referring
again
to
the
proposed
employment
dan
knew
as
he
left
the
hotel
that
if
an
answer
had
been
imperatively
demanded
on
the
spot
he
should
have
accepted
bassett
proposition
but
as
he
walked
slowly
away
questions
rose
in
his
mind
bassett
undoubtedly
expected
to
reap
some
benefit
from
his
services
and
such
services
would
not
of
course
be
in
the
line
of
the
law
they
were
much
more
likely
to
partake
of
the
function
of
journalism
in
obtaining
publicity
for
such
matters
as
bassett
wished
to
promulgate
the
proposed
new
office
at
the
capital
marked
an
advance
of
bassett
pickets
he
was
abandoning
old
fortifications
for
newer
and
stronger
ones
and
dan
imagination
kindled
at
the
thought
of
serving
this
masterful
general
as
he
took
a
long
walk
thinking
of
bassett
offer
and
trying
to
view
it
from
a
philosophical
angle
the
great
leaders
in
american
politics
had
come
oftener
than
not
from
the
country
he
reflected
fraserville
in
dan
cogitations
might
as
bassett
star
rose
prove
to
be
another
springfield
or
fremont
or
canton
shrouding
a
planet
destined
to
a
brilliant
course
toward
the
zenith
he
did
not
doubt
that
plans
were
the
state
senator
was
farseeing
and
shrewd
and
by
attaching
himself
to
this
man
whose
prospects
were
so
bright
he
would
shine
in
the
reflected
glory
of
his
successes
and
the
flattery
of
the
offer
was
not
in
itself
without
its
magic
however
as
the
days
passed
dan
was
glad
that
he
had
taken
time
for
reflection
he
began
to
minimize
the
advantages
of
the
proposed
relationship
and
to
ponder
the
ways
in
which
it
would
compel
a
certain
he
had
sufficient
imagination
to
color
the
various
scenes
in
which
he
saw
himself
bassett
man
in
moods
of
he
knew
his
nature
to
be
sensitive
with
an
emotional
side
whose
expressions
now
and
then
surprised
him
he
rallied
sharply
at
times
from
the
skeptical
attitude
which
he
felt
journalism
was
establishing
in
him
and
assured
himself
that
his
old
ideals
were
safe
in
the
citadel
his
boyhood
imagination
had
built
for
them
dan
father
was
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
and
he
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
the
democratic
party
had
sought
to
destroy
the
union
and
that
the
republican
party
alone
had
saved
it
throughout
his
boyhood
on
the
harrison
county
farm
he
had
been
conscious
of
the
recrudescence
of
the
wartime
feeling
in
every
political
campaign
his
admiration
for
the
heroes
of
the
war
was
in
no
wise
shaken
at
new
haven
but
he
first
realized
there
that
new
issues
demanded
attention
he
grew
impatient
of
all
attempts
to
obscure
these
by
harking
back
to
questions
that
the
war
had
finally
determined
if
it
had
served
any
purpose
whatever
he
broke
a
lance
frequently
with
the
young
men
who
turned
over
the
books
in
wright
and
fitch
office
most
of
whom
were
republicans
and
devout
believers
that
the
furnace
fires
of
america
industries
were
brought
down
from
heaven
by
protection
a
modern
prometheus
of
a
new
order
of
utilitarian
gods
in
the
view
of
these
earnest
debaters
protection
was
the
first
and
last
commandment
the
law
and
the
prophets
the
indianapolis
advertiser
and
protection
newspapers
generally
had
long
attacked
periodically
those
gentlemen
who
enjoying
the
sheltered
life
of
college
and
university
were
corrupting
the
youth
of
the
land
by
questioning
the
wisdom
of
the
god
there
was
a
wide
margin
between
theory
and
practice
between
academic
dilletantism
and
a
prosperous
industrial
life
fostered
and
shielded
by
acts
of
congress
it
required
courage
for
young
men
bred
in
the
popular
faith
to
turn
their
backs
upon
the
high
altar
so
firmly
planted
so
blazing
with
lamps
of
perpetual
adoration
while
dan
was
considering
the
politician
offer
a
letter
from
home
brought
a
fresh
plea
for
help
and
strengthened
a
growing
feeling
that
his
wiser
course
was
to
throw
in
his
fortunes
with
bassett
in
various
small
ways
fitch
had
shown
an
interest
in
harwood
and
dan
resolved
to
take
counsel
of
the
lawyer
before
giving
his
answer
the
little
man
sat
in
his
private
room
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
his
chair
tipped
back
and
his
feet
on
his
desk
he
was
in
his
own
phrase
thinking
out
a
brief
he
fanned
himself
in
a
desultory
fashion
with
a
palm
leaf
dan
had
carried
in
an
arm
load
of
books
which
fitch
indicated
should
be
arranged
on
the
floor
beside
him
dan
lingered
a
moment
and
fitch
well
gave
him
leave
to
proceed
he
stated
bassett
offer
succinctly
telling
of
his
visit
to
fraserville
and
of
the
interview
at
the
whitcomb
when
he
had
concluded
fitch
asked
why
have
you
gone
ahead
and
closed
the
matter
on
the
face
of
it
it
a
good
offer
it
gives
you
a
chance
to
read
law
and
to
be
associated
with
a
man
who
is
in
a
position
to
be
of
great
service
to
you
well
to
tell
the
truth
sir
i
have
had
doubts
bassett
stands
for
some
things
i
do
approve
of
his
kind
of
politics
i
mean
oh
he
does
quite
square
with
your
ideals
is
that
it
i
suppose
that
is
it
mr
fitch
the
humor
kindled
in
the
little
man
brown
eyes
and
his
fingers
played
with
his
whitening
red
beard
just
how
strong
are
those
ideals
of
yours
mr
harwood
they
pretty
strong
i
hope
sir
fitch
dropped
his
feet
from
the
desk
opened
a
drawer
and
drew
out
a
long
envelope
it
may
amuse
you
to
know
that
this
is
the
sketch
of
bassett
you
printed
in
the
last
fall
i
did
know
before
that
you
wrote
it
no
wonder
it
tickled
him
and
er
some
of
it
is
true
i
would
talk
to
any
other
man
in
indiana
about
bassett
he
a
friend
and
a
client
of
mine
he
does
trust
many
people
he
does
the
little
man
eyes
twinkled
he
does
trust
wright
and
he
trusts
me
because
we
are
alike
in
that
we
keep
our
mouths
shut
you
must
have
impressed
him
very
favorably
he
seems
willing
to
take
you
at
face
value
it
would
have
been
quite
natural
for
him
to
have
asked
me
about
you
but
he
did
do
you
know
thatcher
edward
he
has
business
interests
with
bassett
and
thatcher
dabbles
in
politics
just
enough
to
give
him
power
when
he
wants
it
thatcher
is
a
wealthy
man
who
is
fooling
with
small
politics
if
some
day
he
sees
a
red
apple
at
the
top
of
the
tree
he
may
go
for
it
there
be
some
fun
if
bassett
tried
to
shake
down
the
same
apple
i
know
thatcher
son
allen
i
met
him
the
other
day
odd
boy
i
guess
that
one
place
where
ed
thatcher
heart
is
all
right
after
a
moment
reflection
with
his
face
turned
to
the
open
window
fitch
added
harwood
if
you
should
go
to
bassett
and
in
course
of
time
everything
running
smoothly
he
asked
you
to
do
something
that
jarred
with
those
ideals
of
yours
what
should
you
do
i
should
refuse
sir
answered
dan
earnestly
fitch
nodded
gravely
very
well
then
i
say
go
ahead
you
understand
that
i
not
predicting
that
such
a
moment
is
inevitable
but
it
quite
possible
i
say
to
you
what
i
never
said
before
to
any
man
i
understand
morton
bassett
i
known
him
for
ten
years
and
i
know
him
just
as
well
now
as
i
did
the
day
i
first
met
him
that
may
be
my
own
dullness
but
ignoring
all
that
his
enemies
say
of
him
and
he
has
some
very
industrious
ones
as
you
know
he
still
at
his
best
a
very
unusual
and
a
somewhat
peculiar
and
difficult
person
he
different
at
least
but
i
ca
think
him
half
as
bad
as
they
say
he
is
he
is
probably
replied
fitch
whose
eyes
were
contemplating
the
cornice
of
the
building
across
the
street
then
as
though
just
recalling
dan
presence
may
i
ask
you
whether
aside
from
that
article
you
ever
consciously
served
bassett
in
any
way
ever
did
anything
that
might
have
caused
him
to
feel
that
he
was
under
obligations
why
no
sir
nothing
whatever
or
a
considerable
interval
in
which
fitch
gaze
reverted
to
the
cornice
that
you
might
have
some
information
that
made
it
wise
for
him
to
keep
his
hand
on
you
absolutely
nothing
answered
dan
the
least
bit
uncomfortable
under
this
questioning
you
not
aware
the
lawyer
persisted
deliberately
that
you
ever
had
any
dealings
of
any
kind
even
remotely
with
mr
bassett
no
never
beyond
what
i
told
you
then
if
i
were
in
your
place
and
the
man
i
think
you
are
i
accept
the
offer
but
do
bind
yourself
for
a
long
period
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
hang
on
to
your
ideals
it
rather
odd
that
you
and
i
should
be
using
that
word
it
does
get
into
a
law
office
often
if
you
feel
tempted
to
do
things
that
you
know
are
crooked
think
of
billy
sumner
and
act
accordingly
it
getting
to
be
truer
all
the
time
that
few
of
us
are
free
men
what
shakespeare
phrase
upon
a
wheel
of
fire
that
harwood
is
all
of
us
we
have
valuable
clients
in
this
office
that
we
lose
if
i
got
out
and
shouted
my
real
political
convictions
we
all
cowards
but
do
you
be
one
as
soon
as
sure
i
provided
for
my
family
against
the
day
of
wrath
i
going
to
quit
the
law
and
blow
the
dust
off
of
some
of
my
own
ideals
it
thick
i
can
tell
you
this
was
seeing
fitch
in
a
new
aspect
dan
was
immensely
pleased
by
the
lawyer
friendliness
and
he
felt
that
his
counsel
was
sound
fitch
broke
in
on
the
young
man
thoughts
to
say
by
the
way
you
know
where
i
live
come
up
and
dine
with
me
at
seven
if
you
free
my
folks
are
away
and
i
like
to
swap
views
with
you
on
politics
religion
baseball
and
great
subjects
like
that
dan
wrote
his
acceptance
of
bassett
offer
that
night
chapter
x
in
the
boordman
building
harwood
opened
the
office
in
the
boordman
building
and
settled
in
it
the
law
books
bassett
sent
from
fraserville
the
lease
was
taken
in
dan
name
and
he
paid
for
the
furniture
with
his
own
check
bassett
having
given
him
five
hundred
dollars
for
expenses
the
boordman
was
one
of
the
older
buildings
in
washington
street
and
as
it
antedated
the
era
of
elevators
only
the
first
of
its
three
stories
was
occupied
by
offices
its
higher
altitudes
had
fallen
to
miscellaneous
tenants
including
a
few
telegraph
operators
printers
and
other
night
workers
who
lodged
there
for
convenience
dan
immediate
neighbors
proved
to
be
a
shabby
lawyer
who
concealed
by
a
professional
exterior
his
real
vocation
which
was
chattel
mortgages
a
fire
insurance
agency
conducted
by
several
active
young
fellows
of
dan
acquaintance
and
the
office
of
a
pittsburg
firm
of
construction
contractors
presided
over
by
a
girl
who
answered
the
telephone
if
haply
it
rang
at
moments
when
the
heroes
of
the
novels
she
devoured
were
not
in
too
imminent
peril
of
death
this
office
being
nearest
dan
went
in
to
borrow
a
match
for
his
pipe
while
in
the
midst
of
his
moving
and
found
the
girl
rearranging
her
hair
before
a
mirror
that
as
near
heart
disease
as
i
care
to
come
she
said
turning
at
his
beg
pardon
there
has
been
a
man
in
this
place
for
two
weeks
much
less
a
woman
yes
i
can
stake
you
for
a
match
i
keep
them
for
those
insurance
fellows
nice
boys
they
are
too
you
see
she
continued
not
averse
to
prolonging
the
conversation
our
business
is
mostly
outside
hear
about
the
we
building
in
elwood
three
stories
one
of
the
best
little
towns
in
indiana
all
right
say
the
janitor
service
in
this
old
ark
is
something
i
could
describe
to
a
gentleman
if
there
anything
in
these
microbe
fairy
stories
all
die
early
you
might
as
well
know
the
worst
they
do
light
housekeeping
on
the
third
floor
and
the
smell
of
onions
is
what
i
call
annoying
oh
that
all
right
what
a
match
between
friends
the
last
man
who
had
your
office
you
taken
well
he
always
got
his
matches
here
and
touched
me
occasionally
for
a
pink
photo
of
george
washington
stamp
ha
ha
see
he
was
real
nice
and
when
his
wife
dropped
in
to
see
him
one
day
and
i
was
sitting
in
there
joshing
him
and
carrying
on
he
was
that
painfully
embarrassed
i
guess
she
made
him
move
but
lord
they
have
to
bribe
tenants
to
get
in
here
to
crawl
up
one
flight
of
that
stairway
you
have
to
be
a
mountain
climber
i
only
stay
because
the
work
so
congenial
and
it
a
quiet
place
for
reading
and
all
the
processions
pass
here
the
view
of
that
hairdressing
shop
across
the
way
is
something
i
recommend
if
i
had
studied
stenography
i
should
have
taken
up
hairdressing
or
manicuring
a
little
friend
of
mine
works
in
that
shop
and
the
society
ladies
are
most
confidential
i
miss
rose
farrell
if
you
tease
me
to
tell
you
need
say
by
any
other
name
it
just
as
sweet
the
ruffle
a
little
frayed
on
that
bassett
had
stipulated
that
his
name
should
not
appear
and
he
suggested
that
dan
place
his
own
on
the
door
later
when
he
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar
it
would
be
easy
to
add
attorney
at
law
bassett
said
each
of
the
three
rooms
of
what
the
agent
of
the
building
liked
to
call
a
suite
opened
directly
into
the
hall
in
the
first
harwood
set
up
a
desk
for
himself
in
the
second
he
placed
the
library
and
the
third
and
largest
was
to
be
bassett
at
such
times
as
he
cared
to
use
it
throughout
the
summer
harwood
hardly
saw
bassett
and
he
began
to
regret
his
reluctant
assent
to
a
relationship
which
conferred
so
many
benefits
with
so
little
work
he
dug
hungrily
at
the
law
and
felt
that
he
was
making
progress
fitch
who
was
braving
the
heat
in
town
had
outlined
a
course
of
reading
for
him
and
continued
his
manifestations
of
friendliness
by
several
times
asking
him
to
dinner
with
a
motor
ride
later
to
cool
them
off
before
going
to
bed
bassett
kept
pretty
close
to
fraserville
running
into
the
city
occasionally
for
a
few
hours
he
complained
now
and
then
because
he
saw
so
little
of
his
family
who
continued
at
the
lake
dan
had
certain
prescribed
duties
but
these
were
not
onerous
a
great
many
of
the
country
newspapers
began
to
come
to
the
office
and
it
was
business
to
read
them
and
cut
out
any
items
bearing
upon
local
political
conditions
bassett
winnowed
these
carefully
brushing
the
chaff
into
his
wastebasket
and
retaining
a
few
kernels
for
later
use
he
seemed
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
state
press
and
spoke
of
the
rural
newspapers
with
a
respect
that
surprised
harwood
who
had
little
patience
with
what
he
called
the
grapevine
dailies
with
their
scrappy
local
news
patent
insides
and
servile
partisan
opinions
still
he
began
to
find
in
a
considerable
number
of
these
papers
even
those
emanating
from
remote
county
seats
a
certain
raciness
and
independence
this
newspaper
reading
which
dan
had
begun
perfunctorily
soon
interested
him
it
was
thus
he
saw
that
bassett
kept
in
touch
with
state
affairs
sporadic
temperance
movements
squabbles
over
local
improvements
rows
in
school
boards
and
like
matters
were
not
beneath
bassett
notice
he
discussed
these
incidents
and
conditions
with
harwood
who
was
astonished
to
find
how
thoroughly
bassett
knew
the
state
through
all
this
dan
was
not
blind
to
the
sins
charged
against
bassett
there
were
certain
corporations
which
it
was
said
bassett
protected
from
violence
at
the
state
house
but
as
against
this
did
not
the
vast
horde
of
greedy
corporations
maintain
a
lobby
at
every
session
and
was
not
a
certain
amount
of
lobbying
legitimate
again
bassett
had
shielded
the
liquor
interests
from
many
attacks
but
had
not
these
interests
their
rights
and
was
it
not
a
sound
doctrine
that
favored
government
with
the
least
restraint
rather
uglier
had
been
bassett
identification
with
the
organization
of
the
white
river
canneries
company
a
combination
of
industries
on
which
a
scandalous
overissue
of
stock
had
been
sold
in
generous
chunks
to
a
confiding
public
followed
in
a
couple
of
years
by
a
collapse
of
the
business
and
a
reorganization
that
had
frozen
out
all
but
a
favored
few
still
bassett
had
not
been
the
sole
culprit
in
that
affair
and
was
not
this
sort
of
financiering
typical
of
the
time
bassett
and
thatcher
had
both
played
the
gentle
game
of
in
half
a
dozen
other
instances
and
if
they
were
culpable
why
had
they
not
been
brought
to
book
in
his
inner
soul
dan
knew
why
not
in
the
political
game
only
the
stupid
are
annoyed
by
grand
juries
which
take
their
cue
tamely
from
ambitious
prosecuting
attorneys
eager
for
higher
office
bassett
desk
stood
against
the
wall
and
over
it
hung
a
map
of
indiana
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
dan
to
find
bassett
with
his
chair
tipped
back
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
map
the
oblong
checkerboard
formed
by
the
counties
of
the
hoosier
commonwealth
seemed
to
have
a
fascination
for
the
man
from
fraserville
when
dan
found
him
thus
in
rapt
contemplation
bassett
usually
turned
toward
him
a
little
reluctantly
and
absently
it
was
thus
that
morton
bassett
studied
the
field
like
a
careful
general
outlining
his
campaigns
with
ample
data
and
charts
before
him
this
was
an
off
year
politically
or
more
accurately
the
statutes
called
for
no
state
election
in
indiana
for
every
one
knows
that
there
is
no
hour
of
the
day
in
any
year
when
politics
wholly
cease
from
agitating
the
waters
of
the
wabash
somewhere
some
one
is
always
dropping
in
a
pebble
to
see
how
far
the
ripple
will
widen
in
the
torrid
first
days
of
september
the
malfeasance
of
the
treasurer
of
an
ohio
river
county
afforded
the
republican
press
an
opportunity
to
gloat
the
official
in
question
being
of
course
a
democrat
and
a
prominent
member
of
the
state
committee
for
several
days
before
the
exposure
bassett
had
appeared
fitfully
at
the
whitcomb
and
in
the
boordman
building
on
the
day
that
the
republican
advertiser
screamed
delightedly
over
the
democratic
scandal
in
ranger
county
bassett
called
dan
into
his
office
bassett
name
had
been
linked
to
that
of
miles
the
erring
treasurer
in
the
advertiser
headlines
and
its
leading
editorial
had
pointed
to
the
defalcation
as
the
sort
of
thing
that
inevitably
follows
the
domination
of
a
party
by
a
spoilsman
and
corruptionist
like
the
senator
from
fraser
bassett
indicated
by
a
nod
a
copy
of
the
advertiser
on
his
desk
the
joke
was
on
us
this
time
they
pinning
miles
on
me
and
i
guess
i
have
to
wear
him
like
a
bouquet
i
been
in
louisville
fixing
this
thing
up
and
they
wo
have
as
much
fun
as
they
thought
it
a
simple
case
miles
had
found
out
yet
that
corn
margins
are
not
legitimate
investments
for
a
county
money
he
a
good
fellow
and
will
know
better
next
time
we
could
afford
to
have
a
member
of
the
state
committee
in
jail
so
i
met
the
bondsmen
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
he
a
republican
in
louisville
and
we
straightened
it
all
out
the
money
in
bank
down
there
it
proves
to
be
after
all
a
matter
of
bookkeeping
technical
differences
which
were
reconciled
readily
enough
miles
got
scared
those
fellows
always
do
he
be
good
now
dan
had
been
standing
bassett
pointed
to
a
chair
i
want
you
to
write
an
interview
with
me
on
this
case
laying
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
trouble
was
all
due
to
an
antiquated
system
of
keeping
the
accounts
which
miles
inherited
from
his
predecessors
in
office
the
president
of
the
bank
and
the
prosecutor
have
prepared
statements
i
have
them
in
my
pocket
and
i
want
you
to
get
all
the
publicity
you
know
how
for
these
things
let
me
see
in
my
interview
you
better
lay
great
stress
on
the
imperative
need
for
a
uniform
accounting
law
for
county
officials
say
that
we
expect
to
stand
for
this
in
our
next
platform
make
it
strong
have
me
say
that
this
incident
in
ranger
county
while
regrettable
will
serve
a
good
purpose
if
it
arouses
the
minds
of
the
people
to
the
importance
of
changing
the
old
unsatisfactory
method
of
bookkeeping
that
so
frequently
leads
perfectly
trustworthy
and
officials
into
error
do
you
get
the
idea
yes
perfectly
dan
replied
as
i
understand
it
miles
is
guilty
but
you
would
take
advantage
of
the
agitation
to
show
the
necessity
for
reform
exactly
and
while
you
about
it
write
a
vigorous
editorial
for
the
on
the
same
line
and
a
few
ironical
squibs
based
on
the
eagerness
of
the
republican
papers
to
see
all
democrats
through
black
goggles
the
humor
showed
in
bassett
eyes
for
an
instant
and
he
added
praise
the
republican
prosecutor
of
ranger
county
for
refusing
to
yield
to
partisan
pressure
and
take
advantage
of
a
mistakes
of
judgment
he
a
nice
fellow
and
we
got
to
be
good
to
him
this
was
the
first
task
of
importance
that
bassett
had
assigned
to
him
and
dan
addressed
himself
to
it
zealously
if
miles
was
not
really
a
defaulter
there
was
every
reason
why
the
heinous
aspersions
of
the
opposition
press
should
be
dealt
with
vigorously
dan
was
impressed
by
bassett
method
of
dealing
with
a
difficult
situation
miles
had
erred
but
bassett
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
promptly
secretly
and
effectively
his
attitude
toward
the
treasurer
sin
was
tolerant
and
amiable
miles
had
squandered
money
in
gambling
but
the
sin
was
not
uncommon
and
the
amount
of
his
loss
was
sufficient
to
assure
his
penitence
he
was
an
ally
of
bassett
and
it
was
bassett
way
to
take
care
of
his
friends
bassett
had
not
denied
that
the
culprit
had
been
guilty
of
indiscretions
but
he
had
minimized
the
importance
of
his
error
and
adorned
the
tale
with
a
moral
on
which
dan
set
about
laying
the
greatest
emphasis
he
enjoyed
writing
and
in
the
interview
he
attributed
ideas
to
bassett
that
would
have
been
creditable
to
the
most
idealistic
of
statesmen
he
based
the
editorial
bassett
had
suggested
upon
the
interview
and
he
wrote
half
a
dozen
editorial
paragraphs
in
a
vein
of
caustic
humor
that
the
courier
affected
in
the
afternoon
he
copied
his
articles
on
a
typewriter
and
submitted
them
to
bassett
good
very
good
too
bad
to
take
you
out
of
the
newspaper
business
you
have
the
right
point
of
view
and
you
know
how
to
get
hold
of
the
right
end
of
a
sentence
let
me
see
i
wish
you
would
do
another
interview
changing
the
phraseology
and
making
it
short
and
we
give
the
a
chance
to
print
it
i
attend
to
these
other
things
you
better
not
be
running
into
the
office
too
much
now
that
you
with
me
they
have
got
on
to
that
yet
but
they
give
us
a
twist
when
they
do
dan
had
been
admitted
to
the
of
bassett
confidence
but
he
was
to
be
permitted
to
advance
a
step
further
at
four
he
was
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
atwill
the
courier
manager
dan
had
no
acquaintance
with
atwill
whose
advent
had
been
coincident
with
the
courier
change
of
ownership
shortly
after
dan
tentative
connection
with
the
paper
began
atwill
had
rarely
visited
the
editorial
department
but
it
was
no
secret
that
he
exercised
general
supervision
of
the
paper
it
had
been
whispered
among
the
reporters
that
every
issue
was
read
carefully
in
proof
by
atwill
but
dan
had
never
been
particularly
interested
in
this
fact
as
atwill
appeared
in
the
outer
office
bassett
came
from
his
own
room
to
meet
him
the
door
closed
quickly
upon
the
two
and
they
were
together
for
half
an
hour
or
more
then
bassett
summoned
dan
atwill
this
is
harwood
he
was
formerly
employed
on
the
it
was
he
that
wrote
up
the
hoosier
statesmen
you
may
remember
atwill
nodded
i
remember
very
well
those
articles
helped
business
we
could
follow
your
pencil
up
and
down
the
state
on
our
circulation
reports
i
jumped
the
city
editor
for
letting
you
go
atwill
was
a
lean
man
who
chewed
gum
hungrily
his
eyes
were
noticeably
alert
and
keen
there
was
a
tradition
that
he
had
been
a
star
reporter
in
new
york
a
managing
editor
in
pittsburg
and
a
business
manager
in
minneapolis
before
coming
to
supervise
the
courier
for
its
new
owner
atwill
you
and
harwood
had
better
keep
in
touch
with
each
other
harwood
is
studying
law
here
but
he
will
know
pretty
well
what
doing
he
will
probably
write
an
editorial
for
you
occasionally
and
when
it
comes
in
it
wo
be
necessary
for
the
regular
employees
of
the
to
know
where
it
comes
from
harwood
wo
mind
if
they
take
all
the
glory
for
his
work
when
atwill
left
bassett
talked
further
to
harwood
throwing
his
legs
across
a
chair
and
showing
himself
more
at
ease
than
dan
had
yet
seen
him
harwood
he
said
he
had
dropped
the
mister
for
the
first
time
in
their
intercourse
i
opened
the
door
wider
to
you
than
i
ever
did
before
to
any
man
i
trust
you
i
appreciate
that
mr
bassett
i
been
carrying
too
much
and
it
a
relief
to
find
that
i
got
a
man
i
can
unload
on
you
understand
i
trust
you
absolutely
and
in
coming
to
me
as
you
did
and
accepting
these
confidences
i
assume
that
you
do
think
me
as
wicked
as
my
enemies
make
me
out
i
liked
you
said
dan
with
real
feeling
from
that
moment
you
shook
hands
with
me
in
your
house
at
fraserville
when
i
do
believe
in
you
any
longer
i
quit
and
if
that
time
comes
you
may
be
sure
that
i
sha
traffic
in
what
i
learn
of
your
affairs
i
feel
that
i
want
to
say
that
to
you
that
all
right
harwood
i
hope
our
relations
will
be
increasingly
friendly
but
if
you
want
to
quit
at
any
time
you
not
tied
be
sure
of
that
if
you
should
quit
me
i
should
be
disappointed
but
i
would
kick
and
do
build
up
any
quixotic
ideas
of
gratitude
toward
me
when
you
do
like
your
job
move
on
i
guess
we
understand
each
other
if
dan
entertained
any
doubts
as
to
the
ethics
involved
in
handling
of
the
situation
in
ranger
county
they
were
swept
away
by
the
perfect
candor
with
which
bassett
informed
their
new
intimacy
the
most
interesting
and
powerful
character
in
indiana
politics
had
made
a
confidant
of
him
without
attempting
to
exact
vows
of
secrecy
or
threatening
vengeance
for
infractions
of
faith
but
in
a
spirit
of
that
appealed
strongly
to
harwood
bassett
had
given
him
a
to
many
locked
doors
as
you
probably
gathered
bassett
was
saying
atwill
represents
me
at
the
office
i
had
never
suspected
it
dan
replied
has
anybody
suspected
it
asked
bassett
quickly
well
of
course
it
has
been
said
repeatedly
that
you
own
or
control
the
let
them
keep
on
saying
it
they
might
have
hard
work
to
prove
it
and
bassett
eyes
turned
toward
the
window
his
brows
contracted
and
he
shut
his
lips
tightly
so
that
his
stiff
mustache
gave
to
his
mouth
a
sinister
look
that
dan
had
never
seen
before
the
disagreeable
expression
vanished
and
he
was
his
usual
calm
unruffled
self
and
he
concluded
smiling
i
might
have
some
trouble
in
proving
it
myself
dan
was
not
only
accumulating
valuable
information
but
bassett
interested
him
more
and
more
as
a
character
he
was
an
unusual
man
a
new
type
this
senator
from
fraser
with
his
alternating
candor
and
disingenuousness
his
prompt
solutions
of
perplexing
problems
it
was
unimaginable
that
a
man
so
strong
and
so
sure
of
himself
and
so
shrewd
in
extricating
others
from
their
entanglements
could
ever
be
cornered
trapped
or
beaten
bassett
hands
had
impressed
dan
that
first
night
at
fraserville
and
he
watched
them
again
as
bassett
idly
twisted
a
rubber
band
in
his
fingers
how
gentle
those
hands
were
and
how
cruel
they
might
be
the
next
morning
dan
found
that
his
interview
with
bassett
was
the
feature
of
the
first
page
of
the
courier
and
the
statement
he
had
sent
to
the
advertiser
was
hardly
less
prominently
displayed
his
editorial
was
the
courier
leader
and
it
appeared
et
he
viewed
his
work
with
pride
and
satisfaction
even
his
ironical
editorial
briefs
had
he
fancied
something
of
the
piquancy
he
admired
in
the
paragraphing
of
the
new
york
sun
but
his
gratification
at
being
able
to
write
must
matter
for
both
sides
of
a
prominent
journal
was
obscured
by
the
greater
joy
of
being
the
chief
adjutant
of
the
courier
sagacious
concealed
owner
the
advertiser
replied
to
bassett
statement
in
a
tone
of
hilarity
bassett
plea
for
a
better
accounting
system
was
funny
that
was
all
miles
the
treasurer
of
ranger
county
had
been
playing
the
bucket
shops
with
public
moneys
and
the
honorable
morton
bassett
of
fraserville
with
characteristic
zeal
in
a
bad
cause
had
not
only
adjusted
the
shortage
but
was
craftily
trying
to
turn
the
incident
to
the
advantage
of
his
party
the
text
for
the
advertiser
leader
was
the
jingle
when
the
devil
was
sick
the
devil
a
monk
would
be
when
the
devil
got
well
the
devil
a
monk
was
he
bassett
had
left
town
but
the
regular
staff
of
the
courier
kept
up
the
fight
along
the
lines
of
the
articles
dan
had
contributed
the
advertiser
finding
that
the
republican
prosecuting
attorney
of
ranger
county
joined
with
the
local
bank
in
certifying
to
miles
probity
dropped
the
matter
after
a
few
scattering
volleys
however
within
a
week
after
the
miles
incident
the
advertiser
gave
harwood
the
shock
of
an
plunge
into
by
printing
a
sensational
story
under
a
headline
reading
the
boss
in
the
boordman
building
the
honorable
morton
bassett
so
the
article
averred
no
longer
satisfied
to
rule
his
party
amid
the
pastoral
calm
of
fraser
county
had
stolen
into
the
capital
and
secretly
established
headquarters
which
meant
beyond
question
the
manifestation
of
even
a
wider
exercise
of
his
malign
influence
in
indiana
politics
name
enjoyed
a
fame
that
day
that
many
years
of
laborious
achievement
could
not
have
won
for
it
the
advertiser
photographers
had
stolen
in
at
night
and
taken
a
flashlight
picture
of
the
office
door
bearing
the
legend
daniel
harwood
harwood
personal
history
was
set
forth
in
florid
phrases
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
carefully
chosen
and
trained
by
bassett
to
aid
in
his
evil
work
his
connection
with
the
courier
which
had
seemed
to
dan
at
the
time
so
humble
assumed
a
dignity
and
importance
that
highly
amused
him
it
was
quite
like
the
fraserville
boss
to
choose
a
young
man
of
good
antecedents
the
graduate
of
a
great
university
with
no
previous
experience
in
politics
the
better
to
bend
him
to
his
will
talents
and
his
brilliant
career
at
college
all
helped
to
magnify
the
importance
of
bassett
latest
move
morton
bassett
was
dangerous
the
advertiser
conceded
editorially
because
he
had
brains
and
he
was
even
more
to
be
feared
because
he
could
command
the
brains
of
other
men
dan
called
bassett
at
fraserville
on
the
long
distance
telephone
and
told
him
of
the
disclosure
bassett
replied
in
a
few
sentences
that
wo
hurt
anything
i
been
expecting
something
of
the
kind
put
you
in
did
they
i
get
my
paper
and
read
it
carefully
better
cut
the
stuff
out
and
send
it
in
an
envelope
to
make
sure
call
atwill
over
and
tell
him
we
ignore
the
whole
business
i
taking
a
little
rest
but
i
be
in
town
in
about
a
week
dan
was
surprised
to
find
how
bitterly
he
resented
the
attack
on
bassett
the
advertiser
spoke
of
the
leader
as
though
he
were
a
monster
of
immorality
and
dan
honestly
believed
bassett
to
be
no
such
thing
his
loyalty
was
deeply
intensified
by
the
hot
volleys
poured
into
the
boordman
building
but
he
was
not
disturbed
by
the
references
to
himself
he
winced
a
little
bit
at
being
called
a
stool
pigeon
but
he
thought
he
knew
the
reporter
who
had
written
the
article
and
his
experience
in
the
newspaper
office
had
not
been
so
brief
but
that
it
had
killed
his
layman
awe
of
the
printed
word
when
he
walked
into
the
whitcomb
that
evening
the
clerk
made
a
point
of
calling
his
name
and
shaking
hands
with
him
he
was
conscious
that
a
number
of
idlers
in
the
hotel
lobby
regarded
him
with
a
new
interest
some
one
spoke
his
name
audibly
and
he
enjoyed
in
some
degree
the
sensation
of
being
a
person
of
mark
he
crossed
university
square
and
walked
out
meridian
street
to
house
the
lawyer
came
downstairs
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
legal
envelope
in
his
hand
glad
to
see
you
harwood
i
packing
up
going
to
light

in
the
morning
and
get

on
the
end
of
my
family

and
the

moral
character

suffered
so
far
fitch
eyed
him
critically
well
i
have
time
to
talk
to
you
but
here
something
i
wish
do
for
me
i
have
a
deed
for

i
forgot
to

one
of
the
boys
in
the
office

get
her
acknowledgment
but
a
notary
are
you
i
just
been
telephoning
her
about
it
you
know
who
she
is
come
to
think
of
it
she
bassett
you
not
a
good
hoosier
till
you
know
aunt
sally
i
advise
you
to
make
yourself
solid
with
her
i
do
know
what
she
doing
in
town
just
now
but
her
ways
are
always
inscrutable
dan
was
soon
ringing
the
bell
at
owen
owen
was
out
the
maid
said
but
would
be
back
shortly
dan
explained
that
he
had
come
from
fitch
and
she
asked
him
to
walk
into
the
parlor
and
wait
sylvia
garrison
and
her
grandfather
had
been
at
montgomery
since
their
visit
to
waupegan
and
were
now
in
indianapolis
for
a
day
on
their
way
to
boston
the
delaware
street
house
had
been
closed
all
summer
the
floors
were
bare
and
the
furniture
was
still
jacketed
in
linen
sylvia
rose
as
harwood
appeared
at
the
parlor
door
pardon
me
said
dan
as
the
maid
vanished
i
have
an
errand
with
owen
and
i
wait
if
you
do
mind
certainly
owen
has
gone
out
to
make
a
call
but
she
will
be
back
soon
she
went
only
a
little
way
down
the
street
please
have
a
chair
she
hesitated
a
moment
not
knowing
whether
to
remain
or
to
leave
the
young
man
to
himself
dan
determined
the
matter
for
her
by
opening
a
conversation
on
the
state
of
the
weather
september
is
the
most
trying
month
of
the
year
just
when
we
all
tired
of
summer
it
takes
its
last
fling
at
us
it
has
been
very
warm
i
came
over
from
montgomery
this
afternoon
and
it
was
very
dusty
and
disagreeable
on
the
train
from
montgomery
repeated
dan
surprised
and
perplexed
then
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
this
was
the
girl
who
had
opened
the
door
for
him
at
professor
kelton
house
in
montgomery
when
he
had
gone
there
with
a
letter
from
fitch
you
see
he
said
we
met
before
in
your
own
house
you
very
kindly
went
off
to
find
some
one
for
me
and
did
come
back
but
i
passed
you
on
the
campus
as
i
was
leaving
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
name
of
the
old
gentleman
to
whom
he
had
borne
a
letter
from
fitch
he
would
have
forgotten
the
incident
completely
long
ago
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
curious
manner
in
which
the
lawyer
had
received
his
report
and
the
secrecy
so
carefully
enjoined
it
was
odd
that
he
should
have
chanced
upon
these
people
again
dan
did
not
know
many
women
young
or
old
and
he
found
this
encounter
with
sylvia
wholly
agreeable
sylvia
being
as
we
know
seventeen
and
not
an
offense
to
the
eye
it
was
my
grandfather
professor
kelton
you
came
to
see
he
here
with
me
now
but
he
gone
out
to
call
on
an
old
friend
with
mrs
owen
every
detail
of
dan
visit
to
the
cottage
was
clear
in
sylvia
mind
callers
had
been
too
rare
for
there
to
be
any
dimness
of
memory
as
to
the
visit
of
the
stranger
particularly
when
she
had
associated
her
grandfather
subsequent
depression
with
his
coming
dan
felt
that
he
should
scrupulously
avoid
touching
upon
the
visit
to
montgomery
otherwise
than
casually
he
was
still
bound
in
all
honor
to
forget
that
excursion
as
far
as
possible
this
young
person
seemed
very
serious
and
he
was
not
sure
that
she
was
comfortable
in
his
presence
it
was
a
warm
day
i
remember
but
cool
and
pleasant
in
your
library
i
going
to
make
a
confession
when
you
went
off
so
kindly
to
find
professor
kelton
i
picked
up
the
book
you
had
been
reading
and
it
quite
laid
me
low
i
had
imagined
it
would
be
something
cheerful
and
frivolous
to
lift
the
spirit
of
the
jaded
traveler
it
must
have
been
a
good
story
replied
sylvia
guardedly
it
was
it
was
the
and
i
began
at
your
bookmark
and
tried
to
stagger
through
a
page
but
it
floored
me
you
see
how
frank
i
am
i
ought
really
to
have
kept
this
terrible
disclosure
from
you
did
you
like
madison
i
remember
that
i
thought
you
were
comparing
us
unfavorably
with
other
places
you
implied
and
sylvia
smiled
that
you
did
think
madison
a
very
important
college
then
be
sure
of
my
contrition
now
your
virgil
sank
deep
into
my
consciousness
and
i
am
glad
of
this
chance
to
render
unto
madison
the
things
that
are
madison
his
chaffing
way
reminded
her
of
wandless
who
often
struck
a
similar
note
in
their
encounters
sylvia
was
quite
at
ease
now
her
caller
smile
encouraged
friendliness
he
had
dropped
his
fedora
hat
on
a
chair
but
clung
to
his
bamboo
stick
his
gray
sack
suit
with
the
trousers
neatly
creased
and
his
smartly
knotted
tie
proclaimed
him
a
man
of
fashion
the
newest
and
youngest
member
of
the
madison
faculty
who
had
introduced
spats
to
the
campus
was
not
more
impressively
tailored
you
said
you
had
gone
to
a
large
college
and
i
said
oh
you
hit
me
back
straight
enough
laughed
harwood
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
sylvia
protested
coloring
they
evidently
both
remembered
what
had
been
said
at
that
interview
it
was
rude
it
was
quite
the
retort
courteous
my
conceit
at
being
a
yale
man
was
shattered
by
your
shot
well
i
suppose
yale
is
a
good
place
too
said
sylvia
with
a
generous
intention
that
caused
them
both
to
laugh
by
token
of
your
virgilian
diversions
shall
i
assume
that
you
are
a
collegian
really
or
almost
just
almost
i
on
my
way
to
wellesley
now
ah
and
his
exclamation
was
heavy
with
meaning
a
girl
bound
for
college
became
immediately
an
integer
with
which
a
young
man
who
had
not
yet
mislaid
his
diploma
could
reckon
i
have
usually
been
a
supporter
of
vassar
it
the
only
woman
college
i
ever
attended
i
went
up
there
once
to
see
a
girl
i
had
met
at
a
prom
such
is
the
weakness
of
man
i
had
arrayed
myself
as
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
on
my
way
through
pokip
i
gathered
up
a
beautiful
trap
with
a
driver
thinking
in
my
ignorance
that
i
should
make
a
big
hit
by
driving
the
fair
one
over
the
hills
and
far
away
the
horses
were
wonderful
i
found
out
later
that
they
were
the
finest
hearse
horses
in
poughkeepsie
she
was
an
awfully
funny
girl
that
girl
she
always
used
both
and
being
afraid
to
take
chances
with
either
verb
an
idea
i
often
tempted
to
adopt
myself
it
ingenious
at
any
rate
but
how
did
the
drive
go
oh
it
did
she
said
she
could
go
with
me
alone
unless
i
or
her
cousin
it
was
against
the
rules
so
we
agreed
to
be
cousins
and
she
went
off
to
find
the
dean
or
some
awful
autocrat
like
that
to
spring
the
delightful
surprise
that
her
cousin
from
kalamazoo
had
suddenly
appeared
and
might
she
go
driving
with
him
that
was
her
idea
i
assure
you
my
own
depravity
could
suggest
nothing
more
euphonious
than
canajoharie
and
would
you
believe
it
the
consent
being
forthcoming
she
came
back
and
said
she
would
go
absolutely
declined
she
rested
on
the
fine
point
in
ethics
that
while
it
was
not
improper
to
tell
the
fib
it
would
be
highly
sinful
to
take
advantage
of
it
so
we
strolled
over
the
campus
and
she
showed
me
the
sights
while
those
funeral
beasts
champed
their
bits
at
so
much
per
hour
she
was
a
connecticut
girl
and
i
made
a
note
of
the
incident
as
illustrating
a
curious
phase
of
the
new
england
conscience
while
they
were
gayly
ringing
the
changes
on
these
adventures
steps
sounded
on
the
veranda
that
owen
and
my
grandfather
said
sylvia
i
wonder
began
dan
grave
at
once
you
wondering
said
sylvia
whether
my
grandfather
will
remember
you
she
recalled
very
well
her
grandfather
unusual
seriousness
after
harwood
visit
it
seemed
wiser
not
to
bring
the
matter
again
to
his
attention
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
he
did
replied
dan
relieved
that
she
had
anticipated
his
thought
i
was
only
a
messenger
boy
anyhow
and
i
did
know
what
my
errand
was
about
that
day
he
does
remember
faces
well
said
sylvia
and
would
be
likely
to
know
you
as
owen
asked
dan
to
her
office
at
once
it
was
unnecessary
for
sylvia
to
introduce
him
to
her
grandfather
alone
with
owen
dan
business
was
quickly
transacted
she
produced
an
abstract
of
title
and
bade
him
read
aloud
the
description
of
the
property
conveyed
while
she
held
the
deed
at
one
point
she
took
a
pen
and
crossed
a
otherwise
the
work
of
wright
and
fitch
was
approved
when
she
had
signed
her
name
and
while
dan
was
filling
in
the
certificate
she
scrutinized
him
closely
you
in
fitch
office
are
you
she
inquired
not
now
but
i
was
there
for
a
time
i
happened
to
call
on
fitch
this
evening
and
he
asked
me
to
bring
the
deed
over
let
me
see
i
do
believe
i
know
any
harwoods
here
i
have
been
here
long
enough
to
be
known
answered
dan
looking
up
and
smiling
owen
removed
her
hat
and
tossed
it
on
a
little
stand
as
though
hats
were
a
nuisance
in
this
world
and
not
worthy
of
serious
consideration
she
continued
her
observation
of
dan
who
was
applying
a
blotter
to
his
signature
i
have
to
take
this
to
my
office
to
affix
the
seal
i
to
give
it
to
wright
in
the
morning
for
recording
where
is
your
office
mr
harwood
she
asked
flatly
boordman
building
answered
dan
surprised
to
find
himself
uncomfortable
under
her
direct
penetrating
gaze
humph
so
you
morton
bassett
young
man
who
was
written
up
in
the
bassett
has
given
me
a
chance
to
read
law
in
his
office
he
a
prominent
man
and
the
chose
to
put
its
own
interpretation
on
his
kindness
to
me
that
all
answered
dan
with
dignity
sit
still
a
minute
i
forget
sometimes
that
all
the
folks
around
here
do
know
me
i
did
mean
to
be
inquisitive
or
disagreeable
i
was
just
looking
for
information
i
took
notice
of
that
piece
because
bassett
married
my
niece
so
i
naturally
interested
in
what
he
does
yes
owen
i
understand
dan
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
sally
owen
in
one
way
or
another
and
persuaded
now
by
her
change
of
tone
that
she
had
no
intention
of
pillorying
him
for
bassett
misdeeds
he
began
to
enjoy
his
unexpected
colloquy
with
her
she
bent
forward
and
clasped
her
veined
bony
hands
on
the
table
i
glad
of
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
it
providential
your
turning
up
this
way
i
just
came
to
town
yesterday
and
edward
thatcher
dropped
in
last
night
and
got
to
talking
to
me
about
his
boy
allen
dan
was
greatly
surprised
at
this
turn
of
the
conversation
tone
was
wholly
kind
and
she
seemed
deeply
in
earnest
yes
i
mean
allen
thatcher
his
father
says
he
taken
a
great
shine
to
you
i
hardly
know
the
boy
but
he
a
little
queer
and
he
always
been
a
little
sickly
edward
does
know
how
to
handle
him
and
the
ma
well
she
one
of
those
terre
haute
bartlows
and
those
people
never
would
stay
put
edward
made
too
much
money
for
his
wife
good
and
the
united
states
ai
big
enough
for
her
and
the
girls
but
that
boy
got
tired
o
gallivanting
around
over
there
and
he
back
here
on
edward
hands
the
boy
gaits
are
too
much
for
edward
he
says
you
and
allen
get
on
well
together
i
met
him
in
the
bank
and
he
asked
me
about
you
i
like
allen
i
even
very
fond
of
him
and
i
wish
i
could
help
him
find
himself
he
amusing
and
dan
laughed
remembering
their
first
meeting
but
with
a
fine
serious
manly
side
that
you
ca
help
liking
that
nice
it
mighty
nice
you
be
good
to
that
boy
and
you
lose
anything
by
it
how
do
you
and
morton
get
on
i
hope
he
treated
me
generously
then
she
fastened
her
eyes
upon
him
with
quizzical
severity
young
man
the
seems
to
think
morton
bassett
is
crooked
what
do
you
think
about
it
dan
gasped
and
stammered
at
this
disconcerting
question
she
rested
her
arms
on
the
table
and
bent
toward
him
the
humor
showing
in
her
eyes
if
he
crooked
young
man
you
need
think
you
have
to
be
as
big
a
sinner
as
he
is
you
remember
that
sally
owen
told
you
that
be
your
own
boss
morton
a
terrible
persuader
funny
for
me
to
be
talking
to
you
this
way
i
do
usually
get
confidential
so
quick
i
guess
and
her
eyes
twinkled
we
have
to
consider
ourselves
old
friends
to
make
it
right
you
are
very
kind
indeed
owen
i
see
that
i
have
a
responsibility
about
allen
i
keep
an
eye
on
him
drop
in
now
and
then
i
eat
a
good
many
sunday
dinners
alone
when
at
home
and
you
may
come
whenever
you
feel
like
facing
a
tiresome
old
woman
across
the
table
she
followed
him
into
the
hall
where
they
ran
into
sylvia
who
had
been
upstairs
saying
to
her
grandfather
owen
arrested
sylvia
flight
through
the
hall
sylvia
i
guess
you
and
harwood
are
already
acquainted
except
said
dan
that
we
have
been
introduced
then
miss
garrison
this
is
harwood
he
a
yale
college
man
so
i
read
in
the
paper
oh
i
already
knew
that
replied
sylvia
laughing
at
wellesley
please
remember
miss
garrison
about
the
kalamazoo
cousins
said
dan
his
hand
on
the
front
door
i
guess
you
young
folks
did
need
that
introduction
observed
owen
do
forget
to
come
and
see
me
mr
harwood
chapter
xi
the
map
above
bassett
desk
sometimes
in
the
rapid
progress
of
their
acquaintance
allen
thatcher
exasperated
harwood
but
more
often
he
puzzled
and
interested
him
it
was
clear
that
the
millionaire
son
saw
or
thought
he
saw
in
dan
a
type
to
be
thought
a
type
may
be
flattering
or
not
it
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
dan
himself
had
no
illusions
in
the
matter
allen
wanted
to
see
and
if
possible
meet
the
local
characters
of
whom
he
read
in
the
newspapers
and
he
began
joining
harwood
in
visits
to
the
hotels
at
night
hoping
that
these
wonderful
representatives
of
american
democracy
might
appear
harwood
acquaintance
was
widening
he
knew
by
sight
at
least
all
the
prominent
men
of
the
city
and
state
and
after
leaving
the
newspaper
he
still
spent
one
or
two
evenings
a
week
lounging
in
the
hotel
corridors
tradition
survived
of
taller
giants
before
the
days
of
the
contemporaneous
agamemnons
allen
asked
questions
about
these
and
mourned
their
passing
harrison
the
president
gresham
of
the
brown
eyes
judge
and
cabinet
minister
hendricks
the
courtly
gentleman
sometime
uncle
joe
mcdonald
and
dan
voorhees
senators
in
congress
and
loved
in
their
day
by
wide
constituencies
these
had
vanished
but
dan
and
allen
made
a
pious
pilgrimage
one
night
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
david
turpie
who
had
been
a
senator
in
two
widely
separated
eras
and
who
white
and
venerable
like
aigyptos
knew
innumerable
things
the
cloaked
poets
once
visible
in
market
street
had
vanished
before
our
chronicle
opens
with
the
weekly
literary
journals
in
which
they
had
shone
but
dan
was
able
to
introduce
allen
to
james
whitcomb
riley
in
a
bookshop
frequented
by
the
poet
and
that
was
a
great
day
in
life
he
formed
the
habit
of
lying
in
wait
for
the
poet
and
walking
with
him
discussing
keats
and
burns
stevenson
and
kipling
and
others
of
their
common
admirations
one
day
of
days
the
poet
took
allen
home
with
him
and
read
him
a
new
unpublished
poem
and
showed
him
a
rare
photograph
of
stevenson
and
the
outside
of
a
letter
just
received
from
kipling
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
world
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
know
a
poet
and
to
speak
with
him
face
to
face
particularly
a
poet
who
sang
of
his
own
soil
as
allen
wished
to
know
it
still
allen
did
not
quite
understand
how
it
happened
that
a
poet
who
wrote
of
farmers
and
folk
wore
eyeglasses
and
shoes
and
carried
a
folded
silk
umbrella
in
all
weathers
the
active
politicians
who
crossed
his
horizon
interested
allen
greatly
the
rougher
and
more
uncouth
they
were
the
more
he
admired
them
they
were
figures
in
the
great
experiment
no
matter
how
sordid
or
contemptible
harwood
pronounced
them
he
was
always
looking
for
types
and
big
jordan
the
republican
chief
afforded
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
he
viewed
the
local
political
scene
from
an
angle
that
harwood
found
amusing
and
dan
suggested
that
it
must
be
because
the
feudal
taint
and
the
servile
tradition
are
still
in
our
blood
that
we
submit
so
tamely
to
the
rule
of
petty
lordlings
in
his
exalted
moments
allen
ideas
shot
far
into
the
air
and
dan
found
it
necessary
to
pull
him
back
to
earth
i
hardly
see
a
greek
frieze
carved
of
these
brethren
dan
remarked
one
night
as
they
lounged
at
the
whitcomb
when
a
meeting
of
the
state
committee
was
in
progress
these
fellows
would
make
you
weep
if
you
knew
as
much
about
them
as
i
do
there
one
of
the
bright
lights
now
the
honorable
ike
pettit
of
fraser
the
honorable
ike
is
smart
enough
to
be
crooked
he
the
bellowing
falstaff
of
the
hoosier
democracy
i
wonder
who
the
laugh
on
just
now
he
shaking
like
a
jelly
fish
over
something
oh
i
know
him
he
and
father
are
great
chums
he
was
at
the
house
for
dinner
last
night
what
harwood
was
unfeignedly
surprised
at
this
the
editor
of
the
fraser
county
democrat
had
probably
never
dined
at
the
bassetts
in
his
own
town
or
at
least
dan
assumed
as
much
and
since
he
had
gained
an
insight
into
bassett
affairs
he
was
aware
that
the
physical
property
of
the
fraser
county
democrat
was
mortgaged
to
morton
bassett
for
quite
all
it
was
worth
it
was
hardly
possible
that
thatcher
was
cultivating
pettit
acquaintance
for
sheer
joy
of
his
society
as
the
ponderous
editor
lumbered
across
the
lobby
to
where
they
sat
dan
and
allen
rose
to
receive
his
noisily
cordial
salutations
on
his
visits
to
the
capital
arrayed
in
a
tremendous
frock
coat
and
with
a
flapping
slouch
hat
crowning
his
big
head
he
was
a
prodigious
figure
boys
he
said
dropping
an
arm
round
each
of
the
young
men
the
democratic
party
is
the
hope
of
mankind
free
her
of
the
wicked
bosses
boil
the
corruption
out
of
her
and
the
grand
old
hoosier
democracy
will
appear
once
more
upon
the
mountain
tops
as
the
bringer
of
glad
tidings
what
the
answer
my
lads
to
uncle
ike
philosophy
between
campaigns
we
all
reformers
said
harwood
guardedly
i
feel
it
working
in
my
own
system
between
campaigns
replied
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
impressively
we
all
a
contemptible
lot
of
cowards
that
what
the
matter
with
us
was
thomas
jefferson
engaged
in
manipulating
legislatures
did
he
obstruct
the
will
of
the
people
not
by
a
long
shot
he
did
and
that
grand
old
patriot
andrew
jackson
was
he
satisfied
to
take
his
licker
or
let
it
alone
without
being
like
a
heathen
in
his
blindness
bowing
down
to
wood
and
stone
carved
into
saloons
and
distilleries
it
said
by
virtuous
republicans
that
our
party
is
only
a
tail
to
the
liquor
interests
if
you
going
back
to
the
sage
of
monticello
how
do
you
think
he
would
answer
that
bless
you
my
dear
boy
it
not
the
saloons
we
try
to
protect
the
plain
people
who
are
entitled
to
the
widest
and
broadest
liberty
if
you
screw
the
lid
down
on
people
too
tight
you
smother
not
a
drinkin
man
i
go
to
church
and
in
my
newspaper
i
preach
the
felicities
of
sobriety
and
domestic
peace
but
it
not
for
me
to
dictate
to
my
brother
what
he
shall
eat
or
wear
no
sir
and
look
here
do
you
try
to
read
me
out
of
the
democratic
party
young
man
at
heart
our
party
as
sweet
and
strong
as
corn
yea
as
the
young
corn
that
leapeth
to
the
rains
of
june
it
the
bosses
that
keepin
us
down
your
reference
to
corn
throws
us
back
on
the
distilleries
suggested
harwood
laughing
but
he
was
regarding
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
attentively
pettit
had
changed
his
manner
and
stood
rocking
himself
slowly
on
his
heels
he
had
been
a
good
deal
at
the
capital
of
late
and
this
together
with
his
visit
to
thatcher
house
aroused
harwood
curiosity
he
wondered
whether
it
were
possible
that
pettit
and
thatcher
were
conspiring
against
bassett
the
fact
that
he
was
so
heavily
in
debt
to
the
senator
from
fraser
seemed
to
dispose
of
his
fears
since
his
first
visit
to
fraserville
dan
had
heard
many
interesting
and
amusing
things
about
the
editor
pettit
had
begun
life
as
a
lawyer
but
had
relapsed
into
rural
journalism
after
a
futile
effort
to
find
clients
he
had
some
reputation
as
an
orator
and
dan
had
heard
him
make
a
speech
distinguished
by
humor
and
homely
good
sense
at
a
meeting
of
the
democratic
state
editorial
association
pettit
having
once
sat
beside
henry
watterson
at
a
public
dinner
in
louisville
had
thereafter
encouraged
as
modestly
as
possible
a
superstition
that
he
and
watterson
were
the
last
survivors
of
the
old
school
of
american
editors
one
of
his
favorite
jokes
was
the
use
of
the
editorial
we
in
familiar
conversation
he
said
our
wife
and
our
sanctum
and
he
amused
himself
by
introducing
into
the
democrat
trifling
incidents
of
his
domestic
life
beginning
these
items
with
such
phrases
as
while
we
were
weeding
our
asparagus
bed
in
the
cool
of
tuesday
morning
our
wife
noble
woman
that
she
is
etc
his
squibs
of
this
character
quoted
sometimes
in
metropolitan
newspapers
afforded
him
the
greatest
glee
he
appeared
occasionally
as
a
lecturer
his
favorite
subject
being
american
humor
and
he
was
able
to
prove
by
his
that
he
had
penetrated
as
far
east
as
xenia
ohio
and
as
far
west
as
decatur
illinois
once
so
ran
fraserville
tradition
he
had
been
engaged
for
the
lyceum
course
at
springfield
missouri
but
his
contract
had
been
canceled
when
it
was
found
that
his
discourse
was
unillumined
by
the
stereopticon
that
vivifying
accessory
being
just
then
in
high
favor
in
that
community
out
of
his
own
reading
and
reflections
allen
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
franklin
emerson
and
lincoln
were
the
greatest
americans
he
talked
a
great
deal
of
lincoln
and
of
the
civil
war
and
the
monument
in
its
circular
plaza
in
the
heart
of
the
city
symbolized
for
him
all
heroic
things
he
would
sit
on
the
steps
in
the
gray
shadow
at
night
waiting
for
dan
to
finish
some
task
at
his
office
and
harwood
would
find
him
absorbed
dreaming
by
the
singing
foaming
fountains
allen
spoke
with
a
kind
of
passionate
eloquence
of
this
stupendous
experiment
or
this
beautiful
experiment
as
he
liked
to
call
america
dan
put
walt
whitman
into
his
hands
and
afterwards
regretted
it
for
allen
developed
an
attack
of
acute
whitmania
that
tried
dan
patience
severely
dan
had
passed
through
whitman
at
college
and
emerged
safely
on
the
other
side
he
begged
allen
not
to
call
him
camerado
or
lift
so
often
the
perpendicular
hand
he
suggested
to
him
that
while
it
might
be
fine
and
patriotic
to
declaim
when
lilacs
last
in
the
dooryard
bloom
from
the
steps
of
the
monument
at
midnight
the
police
might
take
another
view
of
the
performance
he
began
to
see
however
that
beneath
much
that
was
whimsical
and
sentimental
the
young
fellow
was
sincerely
interested
in
the
trend
of
things
in
what
during
this
whitman
period
he
called
these
states
sometimes
allen
remarks
on
current
events
struck
harwood
by
their
wisdom
the
boy
was
wholesomely
provocative
and
stimulating
he
began
to
feel
that
he
understood
him
and
in
his
own
homelessness
allen
became
a
resource
allen
was
a
creature
of
moods
and
vanished
often
for
days
or
weeks
he
labored
fitfully
in
his
carpenter
shop
at
home
or
with
equal
irregularity
at
a
bench
in
the
shop
of
lüders
a
cabinetmaker
dan
sometimes
sought
him
at
the
shop
which
was
a
headquarters
for
radicals
of
all
sorts
the
workmen
showed
a
great
fondness
for
allen
who
had
been
much
in
germany
and
spoke
their
language
well
he
carried
to
the
shop
quantities
of
german
books
and
periodicals
for
their
enlightenment
the
shop
visitors
included
several
young
americans
among
them
a
newspaper
artist
a
violinist
in
a
theatre
orchestra
and
a
linotype
expert
they
all
wore
large
black
scarfs
and
called
each
other
comrade
allen
earnestly
protested
that
he
still
believed
in
the
american
idea
the
great
experiment
but
if
democracy
should
fail
he
was
ready
to
take
up
socialism
he
talked
of
his
heroes
he
said
they
all
owed
it
to
the
men
who
had
made
and
preserved
the
union
to
give
the
existing
government
a
chance
these
discussions
were
entirely
and
harwood
enjoyed
them
sometimes
they
met
in
the
evening
at
a
saloon
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
shop
where
allen
the
son
of
edward
thatcher
whom
everybody
knew
was
an
object
of
special
interest
he
would
sit
on
a
table
and
lecture
the
saloon
loungers
in
german
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
debate
made
a
point
of
paying
the
score
he
was
most
temperate
himself
sipping
a
glass
of
wine
or
beer
in
the
deliberate
german
fashion
allen
was
a
friendly
soul
and
every
one
liked
him
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
a
lad
whose
ways
were
so
gentle
whose
smile
was
so
appealing
he
liked
dancing
and
went
to
most
of
the
parties
our
capital
has
not
outgrown
its
homely
provincial
habit
of
calling
all
social
entertainments
parties
he
was
unfailingly
courteous
with
a
manner
toward
women
slightly
elaborate
and
reminiscent
of
other
times
there
was
no
question
of
his
social
acceptance
mothers
of
daughters
who
declined
to
speak
to
his
father
welcomed
him
to
their
houses
allen
introduced
dan
to
the
households
he
particularly
fancied
and
they
made
calls
together
on
dan
free
evenings
or
on
sunday
afternoons
snobbishness
was
a
late
arrival
among
us
any
young
man
that
any
one
vouched
for
might
know
the
nicest
girls
harwood
social
circle
was
widening
fitch
and
his
wife
said
a
good
word
for
him
in
influential
quarters
and
the
local
yale
men
had
not
neglected
him
allen
liked
the
theatre
and
exercised
considerable
ingenuity
in
devising
excuses
for
paying
for
the
tickets
when
they
took
young
women
of
their
acquaintance
he
pretended
to
dan
that
he
had
free
tickets
or
got
them
at
a
discount
his
father
made
him
a
generous
allowance
and
he
bought
a
motor
car
in
which
he
declared
dan
had
a
half
interest
they
needed
it
he
said
for
their
social
adventures
at
the
thatcher
house
harwood
caught
fitful
glimpses
of
allen
father
a
bird
of
passage
inured
to
occasionally
harwood
dined
with
the
father
and
son
and
they
would
all
adjourn
to
allen
shop
on
the
third
floor
to
smoke
and
talk
when
allen
gave
rein
to
his
fancy
and
began
descanting
upon
the
grandeur
of
the
republic
and
the
beautiful
experiment
making
in
these
states
dan
would
see
a
blank
puzzled
look
steal
into
thatcher
face
thatcher
adored
allen
he
had
for
him
the
deep
love
of
a
lioness
for
her
cubs
but
all
this
idealistic
patter
the
boy
had
got
hold
of
god
knew
where
sounded
as
strange
to
the
rich
man
as
a
discourse
in
sanskrit
thatcher
had
not
been
among
bassett
callers
in
the
new
office
in
the
boordman
but
late
one
afternoon
when
dan
was
deep
in
the
principles
of
evidence
thatcher
came
in
i
not
expecting
bassett
if
you
wish
to
see
him
said
dan
nope
thatcher
replied
indifferently
i
not
looking
for
mort
in
fraserville
i
happen
to
know
just
talking
to
him
on
the
telephone
so
i
rather
guessed
you
were
alone
that
why
i
came
up
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
bit
harwood
it
must
be
nearly
closing
time
so
suppose
you
lock
the
door
you
see
he
continued
idling
about
the
room
mort
in
the
newspapers
a
good
deal
and
not
being
any
such
terrible
sinner
as
he
is
i
do
care
to
have
his
labels
tacked
on
me
too
much
not
that
mort
is
one
of
my
best
friends
you
know
but
a
family
man
like
me
has
got
to
be
careful
of
his
reputation
harwood
opened
his
drawer
and
took
out
a
box
of
cigars
thatcher
accepted
one
and
lighted
it
deliberately
commenting
on
the
office
as
he
did
so
he
even
strolled
through
the
library
to
the
open
door
of
bassett
private
room
beyond
the
map
of
indiana
suspended
above
bassett
desk
interested
him
and
he
stood
leaning
on
his
stick
and
surveying
it
there
was
something
the
least
bit
insinuating
in
his
manner
the
room
the
map
the
fact
that
morton
bassett
of
fraserville
had
so
to
speak
planted
a
vedette
in
the
heart
of
the
capital
seemed
to
afford
him
mild
cynical
amusement
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
face
twisted
his
mustache
and
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
examined
the
end
of
it
with
fictitious
interest
well
he
ejaculated
damn
it
all
why
not
harwood
did
not
know
why
not
but
a
man
as
rich
as
edward
thatcher
was
entitled
to
his
vagaries
thatcher
sank
into
bassett
swivel
chair
and
swung
round
once
or
twice
as
though
testing
it
meanwhile
eyeing
the
map
then
he
tipped
himself
back
comfortably
and
dropped
his
hat
into
his
lap
his
grayish
brown
hair
was
combed
carefully
from
one
side
across
the
top
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
conceal
his
baldness
i
guess
mort
would
object
to
my
sitting
in
his
chair
provided
i
did
look
at
that
map
too
much
who
was
the
chap
that
the
sword
hung
over
by
a
hair
damocles
well
maybe
that
what
that
map
is
it
would
smash
pretty
hard
if
the
whole
state
fell
down
on
mort
but
mort
knows
just
how
many
voters
there
are
in
every
township
and
just
how
they
line
up
election
morning
there
a
lot
of
brains
in
bassett
head
noticed
it
it
admitted
i
believe
that
he
a
man
of
ability
said
dan
a
little
coldly
thatcher
grinned
you
all
right
harwood
i
know
you
all
right
or
mort
have
put
you
in
here
i
rather
kicking
myself
that
i
did
see
you
first
bassett
has
given
me
a
chance
i
begun
to
fear
i
should
get
you
see
i
studying
law
here
bassett
has
made
that
possible
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
that
good
bassett
usually
picks
winners
from
what
i
hear
of
you
and
what
i
seen
i
think
you
all
right
myself
my
boy
has
taken
quite
a
great
fancy
to
you
thatcher
looked
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
waited
for
dan
to
reply
i
grown
very
fond
of
allen
he
very
unusual
he
full
of
surprises
that
boy
said
thatcher
pointing
his
cigar
at
dan
is
the
greatest
boy
in
the
world
but
damn
it
all
i
do
make
him
out
well
he
different
he
an
idealist
i
not
sure
that
he
is
a
philosopher
thatcher
nodded
as
though
this
were
a
corroboration
of
his
own
surmises
he
has
a
lot
of
ideas
that
are
what
they
call
advanced
but
it
not
for
me
to
say
that
he
is
right
about
them
he
talks
nonsense
some
of
the
time
but
occasionally
he
knocks
me
down
with
a
big
idea
or
his
way
of
putting
a
big
idea
he
does
understand
a
good
deal
that
he
sees
and
yet
he
sometimes
says
something
perfectly
staggering
he
does
by
george
he
does
damn
it
i
took
him
to
see
a
glassworks
the
other
day
thought
it
would
appeal
to
his
sense
of
what
you
call
the
picturesque
but
lord
bless
me
he
asked
how
much
the
blowers
were
paid
and
wanted
me
to
raise
their
pay
on
the
spot
that
was
one
on
me
all
right
i
thought
of
giving
him
the
works
to
play
with
but
i
have
the
nerve
to
offer
it
to
him
after
that
he
either
turn
it
down
or
take
it
and
bust
me
thatcher
had
referred
to
this
incident
with
unmistakable
pride
he
was
evidently
amused
rather
than
chagrined
by
his
son
scorn
of
the
gift
of
a
profitable
industry
i
offered
him
money
to
start
a
carpenter
shop
or
furniture
factory
or
anything
he
wanted
to
tackle
but
he
would
have
it
said
he
wanted
to
work
in
somebody
else
shop
to
get
the
discipline
discipline
that
boy
never
had
any
discipline
in
his
life
i
kept
my
nose
to
the
grindstone
ever
since
i
was
to
a
toad
just
so
that
boy
would
have
to
worry
about
his
daily
bread
and
now
damn
it
all
he
runs
a
carpenter
shop
on
the
top
floor
of
a
house
that
stands
me
lot
furniture
and
all
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
ca
talk
to
everybody
about
this
my
wife
and
daughters
do
want
any
discipline
do
like
the
united
states
or
anything
in
it
except
exchange
on
london
and
here
i
am
with
a
boy
who
wears
overalls
and
tries
to
callous
his
hands
to
look
like
a
laboring
man
if
you
can
figure
that
out
it
a
damn
sight
more
than
i
can
do
it
one
on
ed
thatcher
that
all
if
i
try
to
answer
you
please
do
think
i
pretend
to
any
unusual
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
what
i
see
in
the
boy
is
a
kind
of
poetic
attitude
toward
america
our
politics
the
whole
scheme
and
it
a
poetic
strain
in
him
that
accounts
for
this
feeling
about
labor
and
he
has
a
feeling
for
justice
and
mercy
he
strong
for
the
underdog
i
suppose
said
thatcher
dryly
that
if
he
been
an
underdog
the
way
i
was
he
be
more
tickled
at
a
chance
to
sit
on
top
when
i
wore
overalls
it
was
funny
well
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
him
if
you
really
want
me
to
tell
you
i
say
to
let
him
alone
he
a
perfectly
clean
straight
boy
if
he
were
physically
strong
enough
i
should
recommend
him
to
go
to
college
late
as
it
is
for
him
or
better
to
a
school
where
he
would
really
satisfy
what
seems
to
be
his
sincere
ambition
to
learn
to
do
something
with
his
hands
but
all
right
as
he
is
you
ought
to
be
glad
that
his
aims
are
so
wholesome
there
are
sons
of
prosperous
men
right
around
here
who
see
everything
red
that
boy
declared
thatcher
pride
and
love
surging
in
him
is
as
clean
as
wheat
quite
so
no
one
could
know
him
without
loving
him
and
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
find
myself
in
accord
with
many
of
his
ideas
sort
of
damned
idealist
yourself
i
should
blush
to
say
it
laughed
dan
but
i
feel
my
heart
warming
when
allen
gets
to
soaring
sometimes
he
expresses
himself
with
great
vividness
he
goes
after
me
hard
on
my
notions
i
take
the
count
and
throw
up
the
sponge
oh
that
a
chestnut
that
means
merely
that
the
underdog
had
better
stay
under
if
he
ca
fight
his
way
out
it
seems
tough
when
you
boil
it
down
to
that
i
guess
maybe
right
we
all
ought
to
divide
up
i
willing
only
and
he
grinned
quizzically
i
paired
with
mort
bassett
the
light
in
his
cigar
had
gone
out
he
swung
round
and
faced
the
map
of
indiana
above
morton
bassett
desk
fumbling
in
his
waistcoat
for
a
match
when
he
turned
toward
harwood
again
he
blew
smoke
rings
meditatively
before
speaking
if
you
one
of
these
rotten
idealists
harwood
what
are
you
doing
here
with
bassett
if
that
ai
a
fair
question
do
answer
it
harwood
was
taken
aback
by
the
directness
of
the
question
bassett
had
always
spoken
of
thatcher
with
respect
and
he
resented
the
new
direction
given
to
this
conversation
in
bassett
own
office
dan
straightened
himself
with
dignity
but
before
he
could
speak
thatcher
laughed
and
fanned
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
away
with
his
hands
do
get
hot
that
was
not
a
fair
question
i
know
it
i
guess
bassett
has
his
ideals
just
like
the
rest
of
us
i
suppose
i
got
some
too
though
i
be
embarrassed
if
you
asked
me
to
name
i
suppose
and
he
narrowed
his
eyes
i
suppose
mort
not
only
has
his
ideals
but
his
ambitions
they
go
together
i
reckon
i
hope
he
has
both
thatcher
but
you
are
assuming
that
i
deeper
in
his
confidence
than
the
facts
justify
you
and
he
have
been
acquainted
so
long
that
you
ought
to
know
him
thoroughly
thatcher
did
not
heed
this
mild
rebuke
nor
did
he
resort
to
propitiatory
speech
his
cool
way
of
ignoring
dan
reproach
added
to
the
young
man
annoyance
dan
felt
that
it
was
in
poor
taste
and
ungenerous
for
a
man
of
thatcher
years
and
position
to
come
into
bassett
private
office
to
discuss
him
with
a
subordinate
he
had
already
learned
enough
of
the
relations
of
the
two
men
to
realize
that
perfect
amity
was
essential
between
them
he
was
shocked
by
the
indifference
with
which
thatcher
spoke
of
bassett
of
whom
people
did
not
usually
speak
carelessly
in
this
free
fashion
harwood
own
sense
of
loyalty
was
in
arms
yet
thatcher
seemed
unmindful
that
anything
disagreeable
had
occurred
he
threw
away
his
cigar
and
drew
out
a
fresh
one
which
he
wobbled
about
in
his
mouth
unlighted
he
kept
swinging
round
in
his
chair
to
gaze
at
the
map
above
bassett
desk
the
tinted
outlines
of
the
map
green
pink
and
orange
could
not
have
had
for
him
any
novelty
similar
maps
hung
in
many
offices
and
thatcher
was
moreover
a
native
of
the
state
and
long
familiar
with
its
configuration
perhaps
dan
reflected
its
juxtaposition
to
bassett
desk
was
what
irritated
his
visitor
though
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
this
had
any
significance
he
recalled
now
however
that
when
he
had
arranged
the
rooms
the
map
had
been
hung
in
the
outer
office
but
that
bassett
himself
had
removed
it
to
his
private
room
the
only
change
he
had
made
in
dan
arrangements
it
was
conceivable
that
thatcher
saw
in
the
position
of
the
map
an
adumbration
of
bassett
higher
political
ambition
and
that
this
had
affected
the
capitalist
unpleasantly
thatcher
manner
was
that
of
a
man
so
secure
in
his
own
position
that
he
could
afford
to
trample
others
under
foot
if
he
liked
it
was
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
the
manner
of
a
bully
his
reputation
for
independence
was
well
established
he
was
rich
enough
to
say
what
he
pleased
without
regard
to
the
consequences
and
he
undoubtedly
enjoyed
his
sense
of
power
i
suppose
i
the
only
man
in
indiana
that
ai
afraid
of
mort
bassett
he
announced
casually
it
because
mort
knows
i
ai
afraid
of
him
that
we
get
on
so
well
together
you
been
with
him
long
enough
by
this
time
to
know
that
we
have
some
interests
together
dan
with
his
fingers
interlocked
behind
his
head
nodded
carelessly
he
had
grown
increasingly
resentful
of
thatcher
tone
and
manner
and
was
anxious
to
be
rid
of
him
mort
a
good
deal
than
i
am
mort
likes
to
hide
his
tracks
better
than
that
by
george
mort
does
any
tracks
well
every
man
is
bound
to
break
a
twig
now
and
then
as
he
goes
along
by
george
i
tear
down
the
trees
like
an
elephant
so
they
ca
miss
me
as
dan
made
no
reply
to
this
thatcher
recurred
in
a
moment
to
allen
and
harwood
annoyance
passed
it
was
obvious
that
the
capitalist
had
sought
this
interview
to
talk
of
the
boy
to
make
sure
that
harwood
was
sincerely
interested
in
him
thatcher
manner
of
speaking
of
his
son
was
kind
and
affectionate
the
introduction
of
bassett
into
the
discussion
had
been
purely
incidental
but
it
was
not
less
interesting
because
of
its
unpremeditated
interjection
there
was
possibly
some
jealousy
here
that
would
manifest
itself
later
but
that
was
not
affair
bassett
was
beyond
doubt
able
to
take
care
of
himself
in
emergencies
dan
admiration
for
his
patron
was
strongly
intrenched
in
this
belief
the
bulkier
thatcher
with
the
marks
of
upon
him
and
with
his
bright
waistcoat
and
flashy
necktie
transcending
the
bounds
of
good
taste
struck
him
as
a
weaker
character
if
thatcher
meditated
a
break
with
bassett
the
sturdier
qualities
the
even
hard
strokes
that
bassett
had
a
reputation
for
delivering
would
count
heavily
against
him
i
glad
you
get
on
so
well
with
the
boy
thatcher
was
saying
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
his
upbringing
has
been
a
little
unfortunate
too
much
damned
europe
he
terribly
sore
because
he
did
go
to
college
instead
of
being
tutored
all
over
europe
funny
he
got
all
these
romantic
ideas
about
america
he
sore
at
me
because
he
was
born
poor
and
did
have
to
chop
rails
to
earn
his
way
through
college
and
all
that
the
rest
of
my
family
like
the
money
all
right
they
only
sore
because
i
did
make
it
raising
tulips
but
that
boy
all
right
and
see
here
thatcher
seemed
for
a
moment
embarrassed
by
what
was
in
his
mind
he
fidgeted
in
his
chair
and
eyed
harwood
sharply
see
here
harwood
if
you
find
after
awhile
that
you
do
get
on
with
bassett
or
you
want
to
change
why
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
chance
at
you
i
like
to
put
my
boy
with
you
somehow
die
some
day
and
i
want
to
be
sure
somebody
look
after
him
by
god
he
all
i
got
he
swung
round
but
his
eyes
were
upon
the
floor
he
drew
out
a
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
noisily
by
george
he
exclaimed
i
promised
allen
to
take
you
up
to
sally
owen
you
know
owen
that
right
allen
said
she
been
asking
about
you
she
likes
young
folks
she
never
be
old
herself
allen
and
i
are
going
there
for
supper
and
he
asked
her
if
he
might
bring
you
along
aunt
sally
a
great
woman
and
he
grinned
ruefully
a
good
trader
she
has
beat
me
on
many
a
horse
trade
that
woman
and
i
always
go
back
to
try
it
again
you
kind
o
like
having
her
do
you
and
i
guess
i
the
original
easy
mark
when
it
comes
to
horse
get
your
hat
and
come
along
allen
fixed
this
all
up
with
her
i
guess
you
and
she
are
the
best
friends
the
boy
got
chapter
xii
blurred
windows
with
sylvia
life
in
college
we
have
little
to
do
but
a
few
notes
we
must
make
now
that
she
has
reached
her
sophomore
year
she
had
never
known
girls
until
she
went
to
college
and
she
had
been
the
shyest
of
freshmen
the
least
obtrusive
of
sophomores
she
had
carried
her
work
from
the
start
with
remarkable
ease
and
as
the
dragons
of
failure
were
no
longer
a
menace
she
began
to
give
more
heed
to
the
world
about
her
she
was
early
recognized
as
an
earnest
conscientious
student
whose
work
in
certain
directions
was
brilliant
and
as
a
sophomore
her
fellows
began
to
know
her
and
take
pride
in
her
she
was
relieved
to
find
herself
swept
naturally
into
the
social
currents
of
the
college
she
had
been
afraid
of
appearing
stiff
or
priggish
but
her
quickly
vanished
in
the
broad
wholesome
democracy
of
college
life
the
best
scholar
in
her
class
she
was
never
called
a
grind
and
she
was
far
from
being
a
frump
the
wisest
woman
in
the
faculty
said
of
sylvia
that
girl
with
her
head
among
the
stars
has
her
feet
planted
on
solid
ground
her
life
will
count
and
the
girlhood
that
sylvia
had
partly
lost
was
recovered
and
prolonged
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
an
american
college
girl
sylvia
realized
and
the
varied
intercourse
the
day
hundred
and
one
contacts
and
small
excitements
meant
more
to
her
than
her
fellow
students
knew
when
there
was
fun
in
the
air
sylvia
could
be
relied
upon
to
take
a
hand
in
it
her
allowance
was
not
meagre
and
she
joined
zestfully
in
such
excursions
as
were
possible
to
concerts
lectures
and
the
theatre
she
had
that
reverence
for
new
england
traditions
that
is
found
in
all
young
westerners
it
was
one
of
her
jokes
that
she
took
two
boston
girls
on
their
first
pilgrimage
to
concord
a
joke
that
greatly
tickled
john
ware
brooding
in
his
library
in
delaware
street
a
few
passages
from
her
letters
home
are
illuminative
of
these
college
years
here
are
some
of
her
fellow
students
i
never
knew
before
that
there
were
so
many
kinds
of
people
in
the
world
girls
i
mean
all
parts
of
the
country
are
represented
and
i
suppose
i
shall
always
judge
different
cities
and
states
by
the
girls
they
send
here
there
is
a
california
freshman
who
is
quite
tall
like
the
redwood
trees
i
suppose
and
there
is
a
little
girl
in
my
class
she
seems
little
from
omaha
who
lives
on
a
hilltop
out
there
where
she
can
see
the
missouri
river
and
when
her
father
first
settled
there
indians
were
still
about
she
is
the
nicest
and
gentlest
girl
i
know
and
yet
she
brings
before
me
all
those
pioneer
times
and
makes
me
think
how
fast
the
country
has
grown
and
there
is
a
virginia
girl
in
my
corridor
who
has
the
most
wonderful
way
of
talking
and
there
history
in
that
too
the
history
of
all
the
great
war
and
the
things
you
fought
for
but
i
was
almost
sorry
to
have
to
let
her
know
that
you
fought
on
the
other
side
but
i
tell
her
i
never
realized
just
from
books
and
maps
that
the
united
states
is
so
big
the
girls
bring
their
local
backgrounds
with
them
the
different
aims
and
traits
i
have
drawn
a
map
of
the
country
and
named
all
the
different
states
and
cities
for
the
girls
who
come
from
them
but
this
is
just
for
my
own
fun
of
course
i
never
imagined
one
would
have
preferences
and
like
and
dislike
people
by
a
kind
of
instinct
without
really
knowing
them
but
i
afraid
i
do
it
and
that
all
the
rest
of
us
do
the
same
nothing
in
the
world
is
as
interesting
as
people
just
dear
good
folksy
people
the
correspondence
her
dormitory
neighbors
carried
on
with
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
impressed
her
by
its
abundance
and
she
is
to
be
pardoned
if
she
weighed
the
letters
whose
home
news
was
quoted
constantly
in
her
hearing
against
her
own
slight
receipts
at
the
college
she
knew
that
every
tuesday
morning
there
would
be
a
letter
from
her
grandfather
her
old
friend
wandless
sent
occasionally
in
his
kindly
humorous
fashion
the
news
of
buckeye
lane
and
the
college
and
owen
wrote
a
hurried
line
now
and
then
usually
to
quote
one
of
john
ware
sayings
the
minister
asked
about
sylvia
it
seemed
these
things
helped
but
they
did
not
supply
the
sympathy
of
which
she
was
conscious
in
countless
ways
between
her
fellow
students
and
their
near
of
kin
with
the
approach
of
holiday
times
the
talk
among
her
companions
of
the
homes
that
awaited
them
or
in
the
case
of
many
of
other
homes
where
they
were
to
visit
deepened
her
newly
awakened
sense
of
isolation
fathers
and
mothers
appeared
constantly
to
visit
their
daughters
and
questions
that
had
never
troubled
her
heart
before
arose
to
vex
her
why
was
it
when
these
other
girls
flung
together
from
all
parts
of
the
country
were
so
blest
with
kindred
that
she
had
literally
but
one
kinsman
the
grandfather
on
whom
all
her
love
centred
it
should
not
be
thought
however
that
she
yielded
herself
morbidly
to
these
reflections
but
such
little
things
as
the
receipt
of
gifts
the
daily
references
to
home
affairs
the
photographs
set
out
in
the
rooms
were
not
without
their
stab
she
wrote
to
professor
kelton
i
wish
you
would
send
me
your
picture
of
mother
i
often
wondered
why
you
did
give
it
to
me
wo
you
lend
it
to
me
now
i
think
it
is
put
away
in
your
desk
in
the
library
almost
all
the
girls
have
pictures
of
their
families
some
of
them
of
their
houses
and
even
the
horse
and
dog
in
their
rooms
and
you
must
have
a
new
picture
taken
of
yourself
i
like
it
in
your
doctor
gown
that
they
gave
you
at
williams
it
put
away
in
the
cedar
chest
in
the
attic
mary
will
know
where
and
if
you
have
a
picture
of
father
anywhere
i
should
like
to
have
that
too
she
did
not
know
that
when
this
reached
him
one
of
the
series
of
letters
on
which
the
old
gentleman
lived
these
days
with
its
wellesley
postmark
and
addressed
in
sylvia
clear
running
hand
he
bowed
his
white
head
and
wept
for
he
knew
what
was
in
the
girl
heart
knew
and
dreaded
this
roused
yearning
and
suffered
as
he
realized
the
arid
wastes
of
his
own
ignorance
but
he
sent
her
the
picture
of
her
mother
for
which
she
asked
and
had
the
cottage
photographed
with
mills
hall
showing
faintly
beyond
the
hedge
and
he
meekly
smuggled
his
gown
to
the
city
and
sat
for
his
photograph
these
things
sylvia
proudly
spread
upon
the
walls
of
her
room
he
wrote
to
her
a
letter
that
cost
him
a
day
labor
we
do
seem
to
have
any
photograph
of
your
father
but
things
have
a
way
of
getting
lost
particularly
in
the
hands
of
an
old
fellow
like
me
however
i
have
had
myself
taken
as
you
wished
and
you
can
see
now
what
a
solemn
person
your
grandfather
is
in
his
i
had
forgotten
i
had
that
silk
overcoat
and
i
am
not
sure
now
that
i
did
put
the
hood
on
i
a
sailor
you
know
and
these
fancy
things
stump
me
the
photographer
did
seem
to
understand
that
sort
of
millinery
please
keep
it
dark
your
teachers
might
resent
the
sudden
appearance
in
the
halls
of
wellesley
of
a
grim
old
professor
not
known
to
your
faculty
the
following
has
its
significance
in
sylvia
history
and
we
must
give
it
place
this
also
to
her
grandfather
the
most
interesting
lecture
i
ever
heard
except
yours
was
given
at
the
college
yesterday
by
miss
jane
addams
of
hull
house
the
settlement
worker
and
writer
on
social
reforms
she
such
a
simple
modest
little
woman
that
everybody
loved
her
at
once
she
made
many
things
clear
to
me
that
i
had
only
groped
for
before
she
used
an
expression
that
was
new
to
me
obligations
which
we
all
have
in
this
world
though
i
never
quite
thought
of
it
before
she
a
college
woman
herself
and
feels
that
all
of
us
who
have
better
advantages
than
other
people
should
help
those
who
are
taught
to
climb
it
seems
the
most
practical
idea
in
the
world
that
we
should
gather
up
the
loose
rough
fringes
of
society
and
weave
the
broken
threads
into
a
common
warp
and
woof
the
social
fabric
is
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
thread
to
help
and
to
save
for
the
sheer
love
of
helping
and
saving
is
the
noblest
thing
any
of
us
can
do
i
feel
that
this
must
be
an
old
story
to
you
i
ashamed
that
i
never
saw
it
all
for
myself
it
as
though
i
had
been
looking
at
the
world
through
a
blurred
window
from
a
comfortable
warm
room
when
some
one
came
along
and
brushed
the
pane
clear
so
that
i
could
see
the
suffering
and
hardship
outside
and
feel
my
own
duty
to
go
out
and
help
professor
kelton
spending
a
day
in
the
city
showed
this
to
owen
when
she
asked
for
news
of
sylvia
owen
kept
the
letter
that
john
ware
might
see
it
ware
said
deep
nature
i
knew
that
night
she
told
me
about
the
stars
that
she
would
understand
everything
you
will
hear
of
her
wish
she
would
come
here
to
live
we
need
women
like
that
professor
kelton
met
sylvia
in
new
york
on
her
way
home
for
the
holidays
in
her
freshman
year
and
they
spent
their
christmas
together
in
the
cottage
she
was
bidden
to
several
social
gatherings
in
buckeye
lane
and
to
a
dance
in
town
she
was
now
miss
garrison
a
student
at
wellesley
and
the
good
men
and
women
at
madison
paid
tribute
to
her
new
dignity
something
sylvia
was
knowing
of
that
sweet
daffodil
time
in
the
heart
of
a
girl
before
the
hovering
swallows
dare
to
fly
in
the
midyear
recess
of
her
sophomore
year
she
visited
one
of
her
new
friends
in
boston
in
a
charming
home
of
cultivated
people
the
following
easter
vacation
her
grandfather
joined
her
for
a
flight
to
new
york
and
washington
and
this
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
experiences
during
the
remainder
of
her
college
life
she
was
often
asked
to
the
houses
of
her
girl
friends
in
and
about
boston
her
diffidence
passed
she
found
that
she
had
ideas
and
the
means
of
expressing
them
the
long
summers
were
spent
at
the
cottage
in
the
lane
she
saw
owen
now
and
then
with
deepening
attachment
and
her
friend
never
forgot
to
send
her
a
christmas
gift
once
a
silver
purse
and
a
gold
piece
again
a
watch
always
something
carefully
chosen
and
practical
sylvia
arranged
to
return
to
college
with
two
louis
girls
after
her
senior
christmas
to
save
her
grandfather
the
long
journey
for
he
had
stipulated
that
she
should
never
travel
alone
by
a
happy
chance
dan
harwood
on
his
way
to
boston
to
deliver
an
issue
of
telephone
bonds
in
one
of
bassett
companies
was
a
passenger
on
the
same
train
and
he
promptly
recalled
himself
to
sylvia
who
proudly
presented
him
as
a
yale
man
to
her
companions
a
special
car
filled
with
young
collegians
from
cincinnati
and
the
south
was
later
attached
to
the
train
and
dan
finding
several
yalensians
in
the
company
including
the
year
football
hero
made
them
all
acquainted
with
sylvia
and
her
friends
it
was
not
till
the
next
day
that
dan
found
an
opportunity
for
personal
talk
with
sylvia
but
he
had
already
been
making
comparisons
sylvia
was
as
well
put
up
as
any
of
the
girls
and
he
began
to
note
her
quick
changes
of
expression
the
tones
of
her
voice
the
grace
of
her
slim
strong
hands
he
wanted
to
impress
himself
upon
her
he
wanted
her
to
like
him
news
i
do
know
that
i
can
give
you
any
news
you
probably
know
that
owen
went
to
fraserville
for
christmas
with
the
bassetts
let
me
see
you
do
know
the
bassetts
do
you
yes
i
was
at
waupegan
three
summers
ago
at
owen
and
bassett
and
all
of
them
were
very
good
to
me
you
probably
do
know
that
i
employed
by
bassett
he
has
an
office
in
indianapolis
where
i
trying
to
be
a
lawyer
and
i
do
small
jobs
for
him
i
doing
an
errand
for
him
now
it
will
be
the
first
time
i
been
east
of
the
mountains
since
i
left
college
and
i
going
to
stop
at
new
haven
on
my
way
home
to
see
how
they
getting
on
without
me
by
the
way
you
probably
know
that
marian
is
going
to
college
no
i
did
know
it
exclaimed
sylvia
but
i
knew
her
mother
was
interested
and
i
gave
her
a
wellesley
catalogue
that
was
a
long
time
ago
that
was
when
you
were
visiting
owen
at
waupegan
i
see
said
the
blind
man
what
do
you
see
asked
sylvia
i
see
bassett
and
marian
niece
and
grandniece
respectively
of
aunt
sally
owen
and
as
i
gaze
a
stranger
bound
for
college
suddenly
appears
on
owen
veranda
in
cap
and
gown
tableau
i
do
see
the
picture
sylvia
replied
though
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
i
not
only
see
dan
continued
but
i
hear
the
jingle
of
red
red
gold
off
stage
this
was
going
a
trifle
too
far
sylvia
shook
her
head
and
frowned
that
is
fair
harwood
if
i
guess
what
you
mean
there
no
reason
why
marian
should
go
to
college
my
going
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
have
misunderstood
the
whole
matter
pardon
me
said
dan
quickly
i
mean
no
unkindness
to
any
of
them
they
are
all
very
good
to
me
it
too
bad
though
that
preparation
for
college
had
been
in
mind
until
so
recently
it
would
save
her
a
lot
of
hard
digging
now
i
see
a
good
deal
of
the
family
and
i
even
aware
of
marian
doings
at
miss
waring
school
master
blackford
beguiles
me
into
taking
him
to
football
games
and
i
often
go
with
all
of
them
to
the
theatre
when
they
in
town
bassett
is
very
busy
and
he
does
often
indulge
himself
in
pleasures
he
the
kind
of
man
whose
great
joy
is
in
work
and
he
has
many
things
to
look
after
you
are
a
kind
of
private
secretary
to
the
whole
family
then
but
you
work
at
the
law
at
the
same
time
harwood
face
clouded
for
a
moment
she
noticed
it
and
was
sorry
she
had
spoken
but
he
said
immediately
well
i
have
had
much
time
for
the
law
this
winter
i
have
more
things
to
do
outside
than
i
had
expected
but
i
fear
i
need
prodding
i
too
prone
to
wander
into
other
fields
and
i
getting
a
good
deal
interested
in
politics
you
know
bassett
is
one
of
the
leading
men
in
our
state
yes
i
had
learned
that
i
suppose
he
may
be
senator
or
governor
some
day
that
makes
it
all
the
more
important
that
marian
should
be
fitted
for
high
station
i
do
know
that
just
that
idea
has
struck
her
he
laughed
quite
cheerful
again
it
too
bad
it
ca
be
suggested
to
her
it
might
help
her
with
her
latin
she
tells
me
in
our
confidences
that
she
thinks
latin
a
beast
it
my
rôle
to
pacify
her
but
a
girl
must
live
up
to
her
mother
ambitions
and
bassett
is
ambitious
for
her
children
and
then
there
always
the
unencumbered
aunt
to
please
into
the
bargain
owen
is
shrewd
wise
kind
since
that
night
i
saw
you
there
we
become
pals
she
the
most
stimulating
person
i
ever
knew
she
has
talked
to
me
about
you
several
times
dan
laughed
and
looked
sylvia
in
the
eyes
as
though
wondering
how
far
to
go
and
if
you
not
the
greatest
living
girl
you
have
shamefully
fooled
owen
ware
the
minister
came
in
one
evening
when
i
was
there
and
i
never
heard
such
praise
as
they
gave
you
but
i
approved
of
it
oh
how
nice
of
you
said
sylvia
in
a
tone
so
unlike
her
that
dan
laughed
outright
you
are
the
embodiment
of
loyalty
but
believe
me
i
am
a
loyal
person
myself
please
do
think
me
a
gossip
marian
mother
still
hopes
to
land
her
in
college
next
year
but
she
the
least
studious
of
beings
i
ca
see
her
doing
it
bassett
never
quite
well
and
that
been
bad
for
marian
college
would
be
a
good
thing
for
her
i
seen
many
soaring
young
autocrats
reduced
to
a
proper
humility
at
new
haven
and
i
dare
say
you
girls
have
your
own
way
of
humbling
a
proud
spirit
i
do
believe
marian
needs
humbling
one
ca
help
liking
her
and
she
ever
so
good
to
look
at
she
certainly
handsome
dan
admitted
she
altogether
charming
said
sylvia
warmly
and
she
young
much
younger
than
i
am
for
example
how
old
is
young
or
how
young
is
old
i
had
an
idea
that
you
and
she
were
about
the
same
age
you
flatter
me
i
nearly
four
years
older
but
i
suppose
she
seems
much
more
and
she
knows
a
great
many
things
i
do
i
dare
say
she
does
dan
laughed
and
with
this
they
turned
to
other
matters
dan
sat
facing
her
hat
in
hand
and
as
the
train
rushed
through
the
berkshires
sylvia
formed
new
impressions
of
him
she
saw
him
now
as
a
young
man
of
affairs
with
errands
abroad
this
in
itself
of
significance
and
he
had
to
do
with
politics
a
subject
that
had
begun
to
interest
sylvia
the
cowlick
where
his
hair
parted
kept
a
stubborn
wisp
of
brown
hair
in
rebellion
and
it
shook
amusingly
when
he
spoke
earnestly
or
laughed
his
gray
eyes
were
far
apart
and
his
nose
was
indubitably
a
big
one
he
laughed
a
good
deal
by
which
token
one
saw
that
his
teeth
were
white
and
sound
something
of
the
southwestern
drawl
had
survived
his
years
at
new
haven
but
when
he
became
earnest
his
eyes
snapped
and
he
spoke
with
quick
nervous
energy
in
a
deep
voice
that
was
a
little
harsh
sylvia
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
brothers
and
young
men
friends
of
her
companions
at
college
and
was
now
more
attentive
to
the
outward
form
of
man
than
she
had
thought
of
being
before
when
they
reached
boston
harwood
took
sylvia
and
her
companions
to
luncheon
at
the
touraine
and
put
them
on
their
train
for
wellesley
his
thoughtfulness
and
efficiency
could
not
fail
to
impress
the
young
women
he
was
an
admirable
cavalier
and
sylvia
companions
were
delighted
with
him
he
threatened
them
with
an
early
visit
to
college
suggesting
the
most
daring
possibilities
as
to
his
appearance
he
repeated
at
sylvia
instigation
the
incident
of
the
hearse
horses
at
poughkeepsie
with
new
flourishes
and
cheerfully
proposed
a
cousinship
to
all
of
them
or
perhaps
he
said
when
he
had
found
seats
for
them
and
had
been
admonished
to
leave
perhaps
it
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
my
great
age
to
become
your
uncle
then
you
would
be
cousins
to
each
other
and
we
should
all
be
related
speculations
as
to
whether
he
would
ever
come
kept
the
young
women
laughing
as
they
discussed
him
they
declared
that
the
meeting
on
the
train
had
been
by
ulterior
design
and
they
quite
exhausted
the
fun
of
it
upon
sylvia
who
gained
greatly
in
importance
through
the
encounter
with
harwood
she
was
not
the
demure
young
person
they
had
thought
her
it
was
not
every
girl
who
could
produce
a
personable
young
man
on
a
railway
journey
sylvia
wondered
much
about
marian
and
dramatized
to
herself
the
arrival
at
college
it
did
not
seem
credible
that
bassett
was
preparing
marian
for
college
because
she
sylvia
garrison
was
enrolled
there
sylvia
was
kindly
disposed
toward
all
the
world
and
she
resented
harwood
insinuations
as
for
owen
and
dan
intimations
that
marian
must
be
educated
to
satisfy
the
great
aunt
ideals
as
represented
in
sylvia
well
sylvia
had
no
patience
whatever
with
any
such
idea
chapter

the
ways

the
historian
may
not
always
wait
for
the
last
grain
of
sand
to
mark
the
passing
of
an
hour
he
must
hasten
the
flight
of

by
abrupt
reversals

the

much
competent
evidence
to
borrow
from
the
lawyers
we
must
reject
as
irrelevant
or
immaterial
to
our
main
issue
harwood
was
admitted
to
practice
in
the
united
states
courts
midway
of
his
third
year
in
bassett
office
the
doors
of
the
state
courts
swing
inward
to
any
hoosier
citizen
of
good
moral
character
who
wants
to
practice
law
a
drollery
of
the
hoosier
constitution
still
tolerated
the
humor
of
being
a
mere
constitutional
lawyer
did
not
appeal
to
harwood
who
revered
the
traditions
and
the
great
names
of
his
chosen
profession
and
he
had
first
written
his
name
on
the
rolls
of
the
united
states
district
court
his
work
for
bassett
grew
more
and
more
congenial
the
man
from
fraser
was
concentrating
his
attention
on
business
at
least
he
found
plenty
of
work
for
dan
to
do
after
the
troubled
waters
in
ranger
county
had
been
quieted
and
bassett
advanced
outpost
in
the
boordman
building
had
ceased
to
attract
newspaper
reporters
an
important
receivership
to
which
bassett
had
been
appointed
gave
harwood
employment
of
a
character
bassett
had
been
a
minor
stockholder
in
a
which
had
got
into
difficulties
through
sheer
bad
management
and
as
receiver
he
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
proving
that
the
business
could
be
made
to
pay
the
work
he
assigned
to
harwood
was
to
the
young
man
liking
requiring
as
it
did
considerable
travel
visits
to
the
plant
which
was
only
a
few
journey
from
the
capital
and
negotiations
which
required
the
exercise
of
tact
and
judgment
however
harwood
found
himself
ineluctably
drawn
into
the
state
campaign
that
fall
bassett
was
deeply
engaged
in
all
the
manoeuvres
and
harwood
was
dispatched
frequently
on
errands
to
county
chairmen
and
his
aid
was
welcomed
by
the
literary
bureau
of
the
state
committee
he
prepared
a
speech
whose
quality
he
tested
at
small
meetings
in
his
own
county
and
his
efforts
having
been
favorably
received
he
acted
as
a
supply
to
fill
appointments
where
the
regular
schedule
failed
toward
the
end
of
the
campaign
his
assignments
increased
until
all
his
time
was
taken
by
studying
his
audiences
he
caught
the
trick
of
holding
the
attention
of
large
crowds
his
old
college
sobriquet
of
foghorn
harwood
had
been
revived
and
the
newspapers
mentioned
his
engagements
with
a
casualness
that
implied
fame
he
enjoyed
his
public
appearances
and
the
laughter
and
applause
were
sweet
to
him
after
the
election
bassett
admonished
him
not
to
neglect
the
law
i
want
you
to
make
your
way
in
the
profession
he
said
and
not
let
my
affairs
eat
up
all
your
time
give
me
your
mornings
as
far
as
possible
and
keep
your
afternoons
for
study
if
at
any
time
you
have
to
give
me
a
whole
day
take
the
next
day
for
yourself
but
this
work
you
doing
will
all
help
you
later
lawyers
these
days
have
got
to
be
business
men
you
understand
that
and
you
want
to
get
to
the
top
dan
visited
his
parents
and
brothers
as
often
as
possible
on
the
infertile
harrison
county
acres
to
which
the
mortgage
still
clung
tenaciously
he
had
felt
since
leaving
college
that
he
owed
it
to
the
brothers
who
had
remained
behind
to
wipe
out
the
old
harassing
debt
as
soon
as
possible
the
thought
of
their
struggles
often
made
him
unhappy
and
he
felt
that
he
could
only
justify
his
own
desertion
by
freeing
the
farm
after
one
of
these
visits
bassett
drew
from
him
the
fact
that
the
mortgage
was
about
to
mature
and
that
another
of
a
long
series
of
renewals
of
the
loan
was
necessary
bassett
was
at
once
interested
and
sympathetic
the
amount
of
the
debt
was
three
thousand
dollars
and
he
proposed
that
dan
discharge
it
i
never
said
so
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
receivership
intended
paying
you
for
your
additional
work
if
everything
goes
well
my
own
allowance
ought
to
be
ten
thousand
dollars
and
you
entitled
to
a
share
of
it
i
say
now
that
it
will
be
not
less
than
two
thousand
dollars
i
advance
you
that
amount
at
once
and
carry
your
personal
note
for
the
other
thousand
in
the
fraserville
bank
it
too
bad
you
have
to
use
your
first
money
that
way
but
it
natural
for
you
to
want
to
do
it
i
see
that
you
feel
a
duty
there
and
the
folks
at
home
have
had
that
mortgage
on
their
backs
so
long
that
it
taken
all
the
spirit
out
of
them
you
pay
the
mortgage
when
it
due
and
go
down
and
make
a
little
celebration
of
it
to
cheer
them
up
i
carry
that
thousand
as
long
as
you
like

nigh
to
perishing
of
ennui
in
the
lonely
office
of
the
absentee
steel
construction
agents
had
been
installed
as
stenographer
in
room
a
year
earlier
miss
farrell
had
it
appeared
served
bassett
several
terms
as
stenographer
to
one
of
the
legislative
committees
of
which
he
was
chairman
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
telling
anything
she
said
in
reply
to
dan
cautioning
those
winters
i
worked
at
the
state
house
i
learned
enough
to
fill
three
penitentiaries
with
great
and
good
men
but
you
could
dig
it
out
of
me
with
a
steam
shovel
they
were
going
to
have
me
up
before
an
investigating
committee
once
but
i
had
burned
my
shorthand
notes
and
could
remember
a
thing
your
little
irish
rose
knows
a
few
things
harwood
i
was
on
to
your
office
before
the
sprung
that
story
and
gave
it
away
that
bassett
had
a
room
here
i
spotted
the
senator
from
fraser
coming
up
our
pedestrian
elevator
and
i
know
all
those
rubes
that
have
been
dropping
up
to
see
him
struck
all
in
the
legislature
he
wo
tear
your
collar
if
you
put
me
on
the
job
and
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
about
as
speedy
on
the
machine
as
you
find
all
your
little
rose
asks
is
the
right
to
an
occasional
wednesday
matinée
when
business
droops
like
a
sick
oleander
you
need
worry
about
me
having
callers
i
a
business
woman
i
am
and
i
guess
i
know
what
proper
in
a
business
office
if
i
understand
men
harwood
no
poor
working
girl
does
bassett
was
pleased
with
dan
choice
of
a
stenographer
he
turned
over
to
rose
the
reading
of
the
rural
newspapers
and
sundry
other
routine
matters
there
was
no
doubt
of
miss
farrell
broad
knowledge
of
the
world
or
of
her
fidelity
to
duty
harwood
took
early
opportunity
to
subdue
somewhat
the
pungency
of
the
essences
with
which
she
perfumed
herself
and
she
gave
up
meekly
at
his
behest
she
assumed
at
once
toward
him
that
maternal
attitude
which
is
peculiar
to
office
girls
endowed
with
psychological
insight
he
sought
to
improve
the
character
of
fiction
she
kept
at
hand
for
leisure
moments
and
was
surprised
by
the
aptness
of
her
comments
on
the
books
she
borrowed
on
his
advice
from
the
public
library
she
was
tall
and
trim
with
friendly
eyes
and
a
wit
that
had
been
sharpened
by
adversity
it
can
not
be
denied
that
bassett
and
marian
found
harwood
a
convenient
reed
upon
which
to
lean
nor
was
blackford
above
dragging
his
father
secretary
as
the
family
called
him
forth
into
the
bazaars
of
washington
street
to
assist
in
the
purchase
of
a
baseball
suit
or
in
satisfying
other
cravings
of
his
youthful
heart
bassett
scorning
the
doctors
of
fraserville
had
now
found
a
nerve
specialist
at
the
capital
who
understood
her
troubles
perfectly
marian
at
miss
waring
school
was
supposed
to
be
preparing
for
college
though
miss
waring
had
no
illusions
on
the
subject
marian
made
owen
her
excuse
for
many
absences
from
school
what
was
the
use
of
having
a
wealthy
living
all
alone
in
a
comfortable
house
in
delaware
street
if
one
did
avail
one
self
of
the
rights
and
privileges
conferred
by
such
relationship
when
a
note
from
miss
waring
to
bassett
at
fraserville
conveyed
the
disquieting
news
of
her
daughter
unsatisfactory
progress
bassett
went
to
town
and
dealt
severely
with
marian
owen
was
grimly
silent
when
appealed
to
it
had
never
been
her
idea
that
marian
should
be
prepared
for
college
but
now
that
the
girl
mother
had
pledged
herself
to
the
undertaking
owen
remained
a
passive
spectator
of
the
struggle
owen
was
not
so
dull
but
that
she
surmised
what
had
inspired
this
zeal
for
a
collegiate
training
for
marian
and
her
heart
warmed
toward
the
dark
young
person
at
wellesley
such
being
the
contrariety
of
her
kindly
soul
to
miss
waring
a
particular
friend
of
hers
and
one
of
her
admirations
owen
said
i
want
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
marian
now
that
her
bitten
with
this
idea
of
sending
her
to
college
she
smart
enough
i
guess
too
much
smartness
is
marian
trouble
replied
miss
waring
nothing
in
the
gymnasium
she
ca
do
she
become
the
best
french
scholar
we
ever
had
but
that
about
all
she
worked
hard
at
french
because
she
thinks
it
gives
her
a
grand
air
i
ca
imagine
any
other
reason
she
adorable
and
impossible
do
the
best
you
can
for
her
i
want
her
to
go
to
college
if
she
can
miss
waring
had
the
reputation
of
being
strict
yet
marian
slipped
the
cords
of
routine
and
discipline
with
ease
she
had
passed
triumphantly
from
the
kitchen
fudge
and
homemade
butterscotch
period
of
a
existence
into
the
realm
of
nothing
bored
her
so
much
as
the
afternoon
airings
of
the
school
under
the
eye
of
a
teacher
and
these
she
turned
into
larks
when
she
shared
in
them
twice
in
one
winter
she
had
hopped
upon
a
passing
street
car
and
rolled
away
in
triumph
from
her
meek
and
horrified
companions
and
their
outraged
duenna
she
encouraged
by
means
the
subtlest
the
attentions
of
a
strange
young
gentleman
who
followed
the
school
peregrinations
afar
off

in
pennsylvania
street
serving
as
luck
favored
her
astonishingly
in
her
efforts
to
escape
the
rigors
of
school
discipline
just
when
she
was
forbidden
to
leave
miss
waring
to
spend
nights
and
sundays
at
owen
her
mother
came
to
town
and
opportunely
for
marian
fell
ill
at
the
whitcomb
bassett
was
cruising
languidly
toward
the
sombre
coasts
of
neurasthenia
and
though
she
was
under
the
supervision
of
a
trained
nurse
marian
made
her
mother
illness
an
excuse
for
moving
down
to
the
hotel
to
take
care
of
her
her
father
in
and
out
of
the
city
caring
for
his
multiplying
interests
objected
mildly
but
acquiesced
which
was
simpler
and
more
comfortable
than
opposing
her
having
escaped
from
school
and
established
herself
at
the
whitcomb
marian
summoned
harwood
to
the
hotel
on
the
flimsiest
pretexts
many
of
them
most
ingeniously
plausible
for
example
she
avowed
her
intention
of
carrying
on
her
studies
at
the
hotel
during
her
enforced
retirement
from
miss
waring
and
her
father
secretary
being
a
college
man
could
assist
her
with
her
latin
as
well
as
not
dan
set
tasks
for
her
for
a
week
until
she
wearied
of
the
pretense
she
insisted
that
it
was
too
stupid
for
her
to
go
unattended
to
the
hotel
restaurant
for
her
meals
and
it
was
no
fun
eating
in
her
mother
room
with
that
lady
in
bed
and
the
trained
nurse
at
hand
so
harwood
must
join
her
for
luncheon
and
dinner
at
the
whitcomb
owen
was
out
of
town
bassett
was
most
uncertain
in
his
goings
and
comings
and
bassett
was
beyond
harwood
reach
so
he
obeyed
not
without
chafing
of
spirit
these
commands
of
marian
he
was
conscious
that
people
pointed
her
out
in
the
restaurant
as
morton
bassett
daughter
and
he
did
not
like
the
responsibility
of
this
unauthorized
chaperonage
bassett
was
going
to
a
sanatorium
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
move
but
for
three
weeks
marian
was
on
harwood
hands
her
bland
airs
of
proprietorship
amused
him
when
they
did
not
annoy
him
and
when
he
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
for
her
unnecessary
abandonment
of
school
to
take
care
of
her
mother
her
pretty
had
mitigated
his
impatience
she
knew
the
value
of
her
prettiness
dan
was
a
young
man
and
marian
was
not
without
romantic
longings
just
what
passed
between
her
and
her
mother
harwood
could
not
know
but
the
hand
that
ruled
indulgently
in
health
had
certainly
not
gained
strength
in
sickness
this
was
in
january
when
the
theatres
were
offering
an
unusual
variety
of
attractions
dan
had
been
obliged
to
refuse
more
harshly
than
was
agreeable
to
take
marian
to
see
a
french
farce
that
had
been
widely
advertised
by
its
indecency
her
cool
announcement
that
she
had
read
it
in
french
did
not
seem
to
harwood
to
make
an
educational
matter
of
it
but
he
was
obliged
finally
to
compromise
with
her
on
another
play
her
mother
was
quite
comfortable
she
averred
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
go
to
the
theatre
and
she
forced
the
issue
by
getting
the
tickets
herself
that
evening
when
they
reached
their
seats
dan
observed
that
allen
thatcher
sat
immediately
in
front
of
them
he
turned
and
nodded
to
dan
and
his
eyes
took
in
marian
in
a
moment
she
murmured
an
inquiry
as
to
who
the
young
man
was
and
harwood
was
aware
thereafter
that
marian
divided
her
attention
between
allen
and
the
stage
allen
turned
once
or
twice
in
the
with
some
comment
on
the
play
and
marian
was
pleased
with
his
profile
moreover
he
bore
a
name
with
which
she
had
long
been
familiar
as
the
curtain
fell
she
whispered
to
harwood
you
must
introduce
me
to
thatcher
please
his
father
and
papa
are
friends
and
i
heard
so
much
about
the
family
that
i
just
have
to
know
him
harwood
looked
down
at
her
gravely
to
be
sure
it
was
not
one
of
her
jokes
but
she
was
entirely
serious
he
felt
that
he
must
take
a
stand
with
her
if
her
father
and
mother
were
unaware
of
her
venturesome
nature
he
still
had
his
responsibility
and
it
was
not
incumbent
on
him
to
widen
her
acquaintance
no
he
said
flatly
but
marian
knew
a
trick
or
two
she
loitered
by
her
seat
adjusting
her
wrap
with
unnecessary
deliberation
allen
wishing
to
arrange
an
appointment
with
dan
for
luncheon
the
next
day
waited
for
him
to
come
into
the
aisle
dan
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
introducing
his
charge
to
allen
or
to
any
one
else
and
he
stepped
in
front
of
her
to
get
rid
of
his
friend
with
the
fewest
words
possible
but
marian
so
disposed
herself
at
his
elbow
that
he
could
not
without
awkwardness
refuse
her
she
murmured
allen
name
cordially
leveling
her
eyes
at
him
smilingly
i
often
heard
harwood
speak
of
you
thatcher
he
has
a
great
way
of
speaking
of
his
friends
allen
was
not
a
forthputting
person
and
dan
manner
was
not
encouraging
but
the
trio
remained
together
necessarily
through
the
aisle
to
the
foyer
marian
took
advantage
of
their
slow
exit
to
discuss
the
play
and
with
entire
sophistication
expressing
astonishment
that
allen
was
lukewarm
in
his
praise
of
it
he
could
not
agree
with
her
that
the
leading
woman
was
beautiful
but
she
laughed
when
he
remarked
with
his
droll
intonation
that
the
star
reminded
him
of
a
mannikin
in
a
window
that
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
i
imagined
you
would
say
my
aunt
owen
says
that
you
always
say
something
different
oh
aunt
sally
she
the
grandest
of
women
i
wish
she
were
my
aunt
i
have
aunts
i
could
trade
for
her
at
the
door
allen
paused
marian
running
on
blithely
gave
him
no
opportunity
to
make
his
adieux
oh
are
you
going
our
way
she
demanded
in
a
tone
of
invitation
yes
come
along
it
only
a
step
to
the
hotel
where
miss
bassett
is
staying
said
harwood
finding
that
they
blocked
the
entrance
and
not
seeing
his
way
to
abandoning
allen
on
the
spot
he
never
escaped
the
appeal
that
lay
in
allen
he
was
not
the
sort
of
fellow
one
would
wound
and
there
could
be
no
great
harm
in
allowing
him
to
walk
a
few
blocks
with
marian
bassett
who
had
so
managed
the
situation
as
to
make
his
elimination
difficult
it
was
a
cold
clear
night
and
they
walked
briskly
to
the
whitcomb
when
they
reached
the
hotel
dan
who
had
left
the
conversation
to
marian
and
allen
breathed
a
sigh
that
his
responsibility
was
at
an
end
he
and
allen
would
have
a
walk
and
talk
together
or
they
might
go
up
to
the
boordman
building
for
the
long
lounging
parleys
in
which
allen
delighted
and
which
dan
himself
enjoyed
but
dan
had
not
fully
gauged
the
measure
of
marian
daring
wo
you
please
wait
a
minute
harwood
until
i
see
if
poor
mama
needs
anything
you
know
we
all
rely
on
you
so
i
be
back
in
just
a
moment
so
that
morton
bassett
daughter
observed
allen
when
marian
had
fluttered
into
the
elevator
you
must
have
a
lot
of
fun
taking
her
about
she
much
more
than
i
had
imagined
from
what
said
she
almost
a
dangerous
young
person
the
young
men
found
seats
and
allen
nursed
his
hat
musingly
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
and
the
chance
meeting
with
harwood
was
a
bright
incident
in
a
bleak
eventless
day
oh
she
a
nice
child
replied
harwood
indifferently
but
she
finds
childhood
irksome
it
gives
her
ladyship
a
feeling
of
importance
to
hold
me
here
while
she
asks
after
the
comfort
of
her
mother
i
suppose
a
girl
is
a
woman
when
she
has
learned
that
she
can
tell
a
man
to
wait
you
should
write
a
book
of
aphorisms
and
call
it
young
lady
own
handbook
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
skipping
for
heaven
sake
do
i
want
you
as
an
excuse
for
getting
away
i
think
i
better
go
suggested
allen
i
can
wait
for
you
in
the
office
then
i
should
pay
the
penalty
for
allowing
you
to
escape
she
can
be
very
severe
she
is
a
much
harder
taskmaster
than
her
father
desert
me
allen
took
this
at
face
value
and
it
seemed
only
ordinary
courtesy
to
wait
to
say
to
a
young
woman
who
was
coming
back
in
a
moment
to
report
upon
the
condition
of
a
sick
mother
in
ten
minutes
marian
reappeared
having
left
her
wraps
behind
mama
is
sleeping
beautifully
and
that
a
sign
that
she
better
here
clearly
was
an
end
of
the
matter
and
dan
had
begun
to
say
but
with
the
prettiest
grace
possible
marian
was
addressing
allen
i
terribly
hungry
and
i
sent
down
an
order
for
just
the
smallest
supper
you
see
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
would
both
be
just
as
hungry
as
i
am
so
you
must
come
and
keep
me
company
and
to
anticipate
the
refusal
that
already
glittered
coldly
in
dan
eye
she
continued
mama
does
like
me
to
be
going
into
the
restaurant
alone
but
she
approves
of
mr
harwood
the
head
waiter
was
already
leading
them
to
a
table
set
for
three
in
accordance
with
the
order
manan
had
telephoned
from
her
room
she
had
eliminated
the
possibility
of
discussion
and
harwood
raged
in
his
helplessness
there
was
no
time
for
a
scene
even
if
he
had
thought
it
wise
to
precipitate
one
it
only
a
lobster
you
know
she
said
with
the
careless
ease
of
a
young
woman
quite
habituated
to
midnight
suppers
harwood
frown
of
annoyance
had
not
escaped
her
but
it
only
served
to
add
to
her
complete
joy
in
the
situation
there
were
other
people
about
and
music
proceeded
from
a
screen
of
palms
at
the
end
of
the
having
had
her
way
marian
nibbled
celery
and
addressed
herself
rather
pointedly
to
allen
unmindful
of
the
lingering
traces
of
harwood
discomfiture
by
the
time
the
lobster
was
served
she
was
on
capital
terms
with
allen
in
his
own
delight
in
marian
allen
failed
utterly
to
comprehend
harwood
gloomy
silence
dan
scarcely
touched
his
plate
and
he
knew
that
marian
was
covertly
laughing
at
him
do
you
know
said
allen
speaking
directly
to
dan
we
having
great
arguments
at
lüders
we
turn
the
universe
over
every
day
you
see
miss
bassett
allen
explained
to
marian
i
a
fair
carpenter
and
work
almost
every
day
at
louis
lüders
shop
i
earn
a
dollar
a
day
and
eat
dinner
dinner
mind
you
at
twelve
out
of
a
tin
pail
you
can
see
that
i
a
laboring
man
one
of
the
toiling
millions
you
do
mean
that
seriously
thatcher
not
really
oh
why
will
you
say
that
every
one
says
just
that
no
one
ever
believes
that
i
mean
what
i
say
this
was
part
of
some
joke
marian
surmised
though
she
did
not
quite
grasp
it
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
son
of
the
house
of
thatcher
should
seriously
seek
a
chance
to
do
manual
labor
allen
in
his
dinner
jacket
did
not
look
like
a
laborer
he
was
far
more
her
idea
of
a
poet
or
a
musician
i
went
to
lüders
house
the
other
evening
for
supper
allen
was
saying
i
rather
put
it
up
to
him
to
ask
me
and
he
has
a
house
with
a
garden
and
his
wife
was
most
amusing
we
all
talked
german
including
the
kids
three
of
them
fascinating
little
fellows
he
a
cabinetmaker
miss
bassett
a
producer
of
antiques
and
a
good
one
and
about
the
gentlest
human
being
you
ever
saw
he
talks
about
existing
law
as
though
it
were
some
kind
of
devil
a
monster
devouring
the
world
poor
but
he
wo
let
his
wife
spank
the
children
would
even
when
one
of
them
kicked
a
hole
in
my
hat
i
supposed
that
of
course
there
would
be
dynamite
lying
round
in
tomato
cans
and
when
i
shook
the
pepper
box
i
expected
an
explosion
but
i
did
see
a
gun
on
the
place
he
beautifully
and
laughed
in
the
greatest
way
when
i
asked
him
how
soon
he
thought
of
blowing
up
some
of
our
prominent
citizens
i
really
believe
he
likes
me
strange
but
true
better
not
get
in
too
deep
with
those
fellows
warned
dan
the
police
watch
lüders
carefully
he
considered
dangerous
it
the
quiet
ones
who
are
kind
to
their
families
and
raise
cabbages
that
are
the
most
violent
oh
lüders
says
we
got
to
smash
everything
he
rather
favors
socialism
himself
but
he
wants
to
tear
down
the
first
and
begin
again
you
better
be
careful
or
you
land
in
jail
thatcher
remarked
marian
taking
an
olive
oh
if
anything
as
interesting
as
that
should
happen
to
me
i
should
certainly
die
of
joy
but
your
family
would
like
it
if
you
went
to
jail
persisted
marian
delighting
in
the
confidences
of
a
young
gentleman
for
whom
jails
had
no
terrors
the
thought
of
my
family
is
disturbing
it
positively
disturbing
allen
replied
lüders
has
given
me
a
chance
in
his
shop
and
really
expects
me
to
work
surprising
in
an
anarchist
you
rather
expect
him
to
press
a
stick
of
dynamite
in
your
hand
and
tell
you
to
go
out
and
blow
up
a
bank
lüders
has
a
sense
of
humor
you
know
hence
the
antiques
made
to
coax
money
from
the
purses
of
the
fat
rich
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
being
a
the
lobster
had
been
consumed
and
they
were
almost
alone
in
the
restaurant
marian
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
was
in
no
haste
to
leave
but
dan
caught
the
eye
of
the
hovering
waiter
and
paid
the
check
you
should
have
done
that
marian
protested
it
was
my
party
i
sign
my
own
checks
here
but
having
now
asserted
himself
dan
rose
and
in
a
moment
he
and
allen
had
bidden
her
at
the
elevator
door
you
did
seem
crazy
about
your
lobster
and
you
were
hardly
more
than
polite
to
our
hostess
sorry
to
have
butted
in
but
why
have
you
kept
these
tender
recreations
from
me
oh
that
child
vexes
my
spirit
sometimes
she
bent
on
making
people
do
things
they
do
want
to
do
of
course
the
lobster
was
a
mere
excuse
for
getting
acquainted
with
you
but
you
need
be
too
set
up
about
it
i
think
her
curiosity
about
your
family
is
responsible
these
fake
newspaper
stories
about
your
sister
which
is
it
hermione
or
gwendolen
who
is
always
about
to
marry
a
count
countesses
have
been
common
in
indiana
we
need
a
few
to
add
tone
to
the
local
gossip
oh
murmured
allen
dejectedly
i
sorry
if
you
did
want
me
in
the
party
it
always
the
way
with
me
nobody
ever
really
loves
me
for
myself
alone
what
does
the
adorable
do
besides
midnight
lobsters
i
thought
aunt
sally
said
she
was
at
miss
waring
school
she
is
more
or
less
growled
dan
her
mother
wants
to
put
her
through
college
to
please
the
wealthy
owen
has
shown
interest
in
another
girl
who
is
now
at
wellesley
hence
marian
must
go
to
college
and
the
bare
thought
of
it
bores
her
to
death
she
as
little
adapted
to
a
course
in
college
as
one
of
those
bright
goddesses
who
used
to
adorn
olympus
she
does
strike
me
as
needing
education
she
a
finished
product
i
felt
very
young
in
the
divine
presence
she
gives
one
that
feeling
laughed
dan
his
mood
of
impatience
dissolving
who
this
rival
who
has
made
the
higher
education
seem
necessary
for
morton
bassett
daughter
she
an
amazing
girl
quite
astonishing
if
bassett
were
a
wise
woman
she
would
enter
marian
in
competition
and
besides
i
think
her
fears
are
utterly
groundless
marian
is
delightful
with
her
waywardness
and
and
owen
likes
originals
not
feeble
imitations
i
should
hate
to
try
to
deceive
sally
owen
she
about
the
wisest
person
i
ever
saw
oh
sylvia
owen
has
mentioned
her
the
girl
that
knows
all
the
stars
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
where
morton
bassett
in
all
this
he
rather
more
than
a
shadow
on
the
screen
same
old
story
of
the
absorbed
american
father
and
the
mother
with
nerves
two
afternoons
later
as
harwood
was
crossing
university
park
on
his
way
to
his
he
stopped
short
and
stared
a
little
ahead
of
him
in
the
walk
strolled
a
girl
and
a
young
man
laughing
and
talking
with
the
greatest
animation
there
was
no
questioning
their
identity
it
was
five
and
quite
dark
and
the
air
was
sharp
harwood
paused
and
waited
for
the
two
loiterers
to
cross
the
lighted
space
about
the
little
park
central
fountain
it
seemed
incredible
that
marian
and
allen
should
be
abroad
together
in
this
dallying
fashion
his
anger
rose
against
allen
but
he
curbed
an
impulse
to
send
him
promptly
about
his
business
and
take
marian
back
to
the
whitcomb
bassett
was
expected
in
town
that
evening
and
dan
saw
his
duty
clearly
in
regard
to
marian
she
must
be
returned
to
school
the
young
people
were
hitting
it
off
wonderfully
and
marian
laughter
rang
out
clearly
upon
the
winter
air
her
tall
supple
figure
her
head
capped
with
a
fur
toque
and
more
than
all
the
indubitable
evidence
that
such
a
clandestine
stroll
as
this
gave
her
the
keenest
delight
drove
home
to
harwood
the
realization
that
marian
was
no
longer
a
child
but
a
young
woman
obstinately
bent
upon
her
own
way
allen
was
an
emotional
boy
whose
susceptibilities
in
the
matter
of
girls
dan
had
already
noted
the
combination
had
its
dangers
and
his
anger
rose
as
he
followed
them
at
a
safe
distance
they
prolonged
their
walk
for
half
an
hour
coming
at
last
to
the
whitcomb
harwood
waylaid
allen
in
the
hotel
office
a
moment
after
marian
had
gone
to
her
room
the
young
fellow
cheeks
were
unwontedly
bright
from
the
cold
or
from
the
excitement
of
his
encounter
halloa
i
was
going
to
look
you
up
and
ask
you
to
have
dinner
with
me
you
were
looking
for
me
in
a
likely
place
replied
harwood
coldly
see
here
allen
i
been
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
you
were
a
gentleman
oh
have
we
come
to
that
you
know
better
than
to
go
loafing
through
town
with
a
truant
you
hardly
know
i
suppose
it
my
fault
for
introducing
you
to
her
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
you
managed
this
did
you
telephone
her
or
write
a
note
sit
down
here
now
and
let
have
it
out
they
drew
away
from
the
crowd
and
found
seats
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
lobby
harwood
his
anger
unabated
repeated
his
question
out
with
it
just
how
did
you
manage
it
allen
was
twisting
his
gloves
nervously
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
transgressing
any
law
but
he
would
not
for
worlds
have
invited
harwood
displeasure
he
was
near
to
tears
but
he
remained
stubbornly
silent
until
harwood
again
demanded
to
know
how
he
contrived
the
meeting
with
marian
i
sorry
old
man
allen
answered
but
i
ca
tell
you
anything
about
it
i
do
see
that
my
crime
is
so
heinous
she
has
been
cooped
up
in
the
hotel
all
day
with
her
sick
mother
and
a
short
walk
it
was
only
a
few
blocks
could
have
done
her
any
harm
i
think
making
too
much
of
it
you
were
dallying
there
in
the
park
in
a
way
to
attract
attention
with
a
headstrong
silly
girl
that
you
ought
to
have
protected
from
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
better
than
that
allen
enfolded
in
his
long
ulster
shuffled
his
feet
on
the
tiling
like
a
in
disgrace
deep
down
in
his
heart
harwood
did
not
believe
that
allen
had
proposed
the
walk
to
marian
it
was
far
likelier
that
marian
had
sought
the
meeting
by
note
or
telephone
he
turned
upon
allen
with
a
slight
relaxation
of
his
sternness
you
did
write
her
a
note
or
telephone
her
you
did
do
either
did
you
allen
silent
and
dejected
dropped
his
gloves
and
picked
them
up
the
color
deepening
in
his
cheeks
i
just
happened
to
meet
her
that
all
he
said
avoiding
dan
eyes
she
wrote
you
a
note
or
telephoned
you
silence
humph
grunted
harwood
she
wonderfully
beautiful
and
strong
and
so
tremendously
vivid
i
think
those
nice
girls
you
read
of
in
the
greek
mythology
must
have
been
like
that
murmured
allen
sighing
heavily
i
dare
say
they
were
snapped
harwood
searching
the
thin
sensitive
face
and
meeting
for
an
instant
his
dreamy
eyes
he
was
touched
anew
by
the
pathos
in
the
boy
whose
nature
was
a
light
web
of
finespun
golden
cords
thrilling
to
any
breath
of
fancy
the
superb
health
the
dash
and
daring
of
a
that
he
had
seen
but
once
or
twice
had
sent
him
climbing
upon
a
frail
ladder
of
romantic
dreams
harwood
struck
his
hands
together
sharply
if
he
owed
a
duty
to
marian
and
her
family
not
less
he
was
bound
to
turn
allen
thoughts
into
safe
channels
of
course
it
would
do
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
allen
i
mean
to
beat
you
into
the
dust
let
go
over
to
pop
june
and
get
some
oysters
i
do
feel
up
to
our
usual
discussion
of
christian
science
at
the
first
opportunity
dan
suggested
to
bassett
without
mentioning
marian
adventure
with
allen
that
the
whitcomb
was
no
place
for
her
and
that
her
pursuit
of
knowledge
under
his
own
tutorship
was
the
merest
farce
whereupon
bassett
sent
her
back
immediately
to
miss
waring
chapter
xiv
the
passing
of
andrew
kelton
andrew
kelton
died
suddenly
near
the
end
of
may
in
sylvia
senior
year
at
college
the
end
came
unexpectedly
of
heart
trouble
harwood
read
of
it
in
the
morning
newspaper
and
soon
after
he
reached
his
office
owen
called
him
on
the
telephone
to
say
that
she
was
going
to
montgomery
at
once
and
asking
him
to
meet
sylvia
as
she
passed
through
indianapolis
on
her
way
home
both
of
the
morning
papers
printed
laudatory
articles
on
kelton
he
had
been
held
in
high
esteem
by
all
the
friends
of
madison
college
and
his
name
was
known
to
educators
throughout
the
country
on
the
same
afternoon
bassett
appeared
in
town
on
the
heels
of
a
letter
saying
that
dan
need
not
expect
him
until
the
following
week
thought
i
better
see
fitch
about
some
receiver
business
so
i
came
down
a
little
ahead
of
time
what
new
nothing
very
exciting
there
a
good
deal
of
political
buzz
but
i
do
believe
anything
has
happened
that
you
do
know
from
the
way
candidates
are
turning
up
for
state
office
our
fellows
must
think
they
have
a
chance
of
winning
bassett
was
unfailingly
punctilious
in
forecasting
his
appearances
in
town
and
his
explanation
that
legal
matters
had
brought
him
down
was
not
wholly
illuminative
dan
knew
that
the
receivership
was
following
its
prescribed
course
and
he
was
himself
through
an
arrangement
made
by
bassett
in
touch
with
fitch
and
understood
the
legal
status
of
the
case
perfectly
as
bassett
passed
through
the
library
to
his
own
room
he
paused
to
indulge
in
a
moment
banter
with
miss
farrell
it
was
not
until
he
had
opened
his
desk
that
he
replied
to
harwood
remark
a
few
good
men
on
our
ticket
might
pull
through
next
time
but
it
will
take
us
a
little
longer
to
get
the
party
whipped
into
shape
again
and
strong
enough
to
pull
a
ticket
through
but
hope
springs
eternal
you
have
noticed
that
i
do
talk
on
national
affairs
when
the
reporters
come
to
me
in
the
state
committee
i
tell
them
to
put
all
the
snap
they
can
into
the
county
organizations
and
try
to
get
good
men
on
local
tickets
when
the
boys
out
west
get
tired
of
being
licked
we
will
start
in
again
and
do
business
at
the
old
stand
i
always
taken
care
that
they
should
have
a
chance
to
attack
my
regularity
i
just
been
reading
a
book
of
cleveland
speeches
remarked
dan
solemn
but
sound
he
will
undoubtedly
go
down
as
one
of
the
great
presidents
i
think
republicans
and
men
of
all
sorts
of
political
ideas
will
come
to
that
but
i
do
feel
that
all
this
radicalism
is
a
passing
phase
eating
deeply
into
the
republicans
too
we
on
the
eve
of
a
revival
of
patriotism
and
party
names
do
mean
what
they
did
but
i
believe
the
democratic
party
is
still
the
best
hope
of
the
people
even
when
the
people
go
clean
off
their
heads
you
believe
in
democracy
but
you
doubt
sometimes
whether
the
democratic
party
is
really
the
custodian
of
the
true
faith
of
democracy
is
that
it
that
exactly
it
and
my
young
republican
friends
feel
the
same
way
about
their
party
well
i
guess
i
stand
about
where
you
do
i
believe
in
parties
i
think
there
much
gained
by
jumping
around
from
one
party
to
another
and
independent
movements
are
as
likely
to
do
harm
as
good
i
do
mind
confessing
to
you
that
i
had
a
good
notion
to
join
the
democratic
schism
in
and
support
palmer
and
buckner
but
i
did
and
i
not
sorry
i
kept
regular
and
held
on
i
believed
the
silver
business
would
pass
over
and
it
out
of
sight
they
charged
me
with
voting
the
republican
ticket
in
but
that
a
lie
i
never
scratched
a
ticket
since
i
first
voted
and
bassett
smiled
his
grim
smile
i
naturally
voted
for
a
good
many
rascals
by
the
way
how
much
are
you
seeing
of
atwill
i
make
a
point
of
seeing
him
once
a
week
or
oftener
when
i
downtown
at
night
i
usually
catch
him
for
a
late
supper
the
is
regular
all
right
enough
it
a
good
property
and
when
our
party
gets
through
chasing
and
gets
down
to
business
again
it
will
be
more
valuable
was
that
your
editorial
yesterday
on
municipal
government
good
i
for
trying
some
of
these
new
ideas
i
been
reading
a
lot
of
stuff
on
municipal
government
abroad
and
some
of
those
foreign
ideas
we
ought
to
try
here
i
want
the
to
take
the
lead
in
those
things
it
may
help
and
bassett
smiled
it
may
help
to
make
the
high
brows
see
that
ours
has
really
been
the
party
of
progress
through
these
years
when
it
marched
backward
bassett
swung
round
slowly
until
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
map
reminding
the
young
man
of
thatcher
interest
in
that
varicolored
oblong
of
paper
dan
had
never
mentioned
thatcher
visit
to
the
office
feeling
that
if
the
capitalist
were
really
the
bold
man
he
appeared
to
be
he
would
show
his
hand
to
bassett
soon
enough
moreover
confidence
in
bassett
powers
had
never
wavered
in
the
management
of
the
receivership
the
senator
from
fraser
had
demonstrated
a
sagacity
and
resourcefulness
that
had
impressed
dan
anew
bassett
possessed
in
unusual
degree
the
astuteness
and
executive
force
of
the
successful
american
business
man
and
his
nice
feeling
for
the
things
that
interest
cultivated
people
lifted
him
far
above
the
common
type
of
political
boss
dan
had
yet
to
see
a
demonstration
of
political
venality
the
bank
and
his
other
interests
at
fraserville
were
profitable
it
must
be
a
craving
for
power
not
money
dan
reasoned
that
led
bassett
into
politics
bassett
turned
to
his
desk
with
some
letters
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
it
occurred
to
dan
that
as
owen
had
suggested
that
he
accompany
sylvia
to
montgomery
it
would
be
well
to
mention
the
possibility
of
his
leaving
town
for
a
day
owen
telephoned
me
this
morning
of
professor
kelton
death
you
probably
read
of
it
in
papers
owen
is
an
old
friend
of
his
and
went
to
montgomery
on
the
noon
train
she
asked
me
to
meet
the
professor
granddaughter
miss
garrison
when
she
comes
through
here
in
the
morning
on
her
way
home
i
know
her
slightly
and
i
think
i
better
go
over
to
montgomery
with
her
if
you
do
mind
yes
certainly
i
was
sorry
to
read
of
kelton
death
owen
will
feel
it
deeply
it
a
blow
to
these
old
people
when
one
of
them
drops
out
of
the
ranks
i
glad
the
printed
that
capital
sketch
of
him
much
better
than
the
while
i
think
of
it
i
wish
you
would
tell
atwill
that
i
like
the
idea
of
saying
a
word
editorially
for
these
old
citizens
as
they
leave
us
it
gives
the
paper
tone
and
i
like
to
show
appreciation
of
fine
characters
like
kelton
bassett
had
turned
round
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
unfolded
it
slowly
and
went
on
scanning
it
as
he
talked
i
sorry
i
never
knew
kelton
they
say
he
was
a
very
able
mathematician
and
astronomer
it
rather
remarkable
that
we
should
have
kept
him
in
indiana
i
suppose
you
may
have
seen
him
at
owen
they
had
a
common
tie
in
their
kentucky
connections
i
guess
there
no
tie
quite
like
the
kentucky
tie
unless
it
the
virginian
he
seemed
absorbed
in
the
letter
one
of
a
number
he
had
taken
from
his
bag
then
he
glanced
up
as
though
waiting
for
dan
reply
no
i
never
saw
him
at
owen
but
i
did
meet
him
once
in
montgomery
he
was
a
fine
old
gentleman
you
would
hardly
imagine
him
ever
to
have
been
a
naval
officer
he
was
quite
the
elderly
spectacled
professor
in
his
bearing
and
manner
i
suppose
even
a
man
bred
to
the
sea
loses
the
look
of
a
sailor
if
he
lives
inland
long
enough
bassett
observed
i
think
my
brief
interview
with
him
rather
indicated
that
he
had
been
a
man
of
action
the
old
discipline
of
the
ship
may
have
been
in
that
remarked
harwood
then
fearing
that
he
might
be
laying
himself
open
to
questions
that
he
should
have
to
avoid
answering
he
said
kelton
wrote
a
good
deal
on
astronomical
subjects
and
his
textbooks
have
been
popular
sylvia
garrison
the
granddaughter
is
something
of
a
wonder
herself
bright
girl
is
she
quite
so
and
very
nice
to
look
at
i
met
her
on
the
train
when
i
went
to
boston
with
those
bonds
in
january
she
was
going
back
to
college
after
the
holidays
she
very
interesting
quite
different
different
repeated
bassett
vaguely
dropping
back
in
his
chair
but
again
referring
absently
to
the
letter
yes
dan
smiled
she
has
a
lot
of
individuality
she
a
serious
young
person
very
i
should
say
they
tell
me
she
walks
through
mathematics
like
a
young
duchess
through
the
minuet
some
other
wellesley
girls
were
on
the
train
and
they
did
not
scruple
to
attribute
miraculous
powers
to
her
a
good
sign
other
girls
liking
her
so
much
they
were
very
frank
in
their
admiration
owen
had
her
at
waupegan
several
years
ago
and
my
wife
and
marian
met
her
there
bassett
was
greatly
impressed
by
her
fine
mind
it
seems
to
me
i
saw
her
too
that
summer
but
of
course
she
grown
up
since
then
he
glanced
at
harwood
as
though
for
confirmation
of
these
details
but
dan
thoughts
were
elsewhere
he
was
thinking
of
sylvia
speeding
homeward
and
of
the
little
cottage
beside
the
campus
his
subsequent
meetings
with
sylvia
had
caused
a
requickening
of
all
the
impressions
of
his
visit
to
professor
kelton
and
he
had
been
recalling
that
errand
again
the
old
gentleman
had
given
his
answer
with
decision
harwood
recalled
the
crisp
of
the
negative
and
the
professor
had
lifted
his
head
slightly
as
he
spoke
the
word
dan
remembered
the
peace
of
the
cottage
the
sweet
scents
of
june
blowing
through
the
open
windows
and
he
remembered
sylvia
as
she
had
opened
the
door
and
their
colloquy
later
on
the
campus
you
better
go
to
montgomery
with
miss
garrison
and
report
to
owen
for
any
service
you
may
render
her
does
the
old
gentleman
death
leave
the
girl
alone
quite
so
i
think
she
had
lived
with
him
nearly
all
her
life
the
papers
mentioned
no
other
near
relatives
i
be
in
town
a
day
or
two
you
do
what
you
can
over
there
for
mrs
owen
that
evening
returning
to
the
office
to
clear
off
his
desk
in
preparation
for
his
absence
the
next
day
dan
found
bassett
there
this
was
unusual
bassett
rarely
visited
the
office
at
night
he
had
evidently
been
deeply
occupied
with
his
thoughts
for
when
dan
entered
he
was
sitting
before
his
closed
desk
with
his
hat
on
he
nodded
and
a
few
moments
later
passed
through
the
library
on
his
way
out
suppose
i
wo
see
you
well
i
going
to
be
in
town
a
few
days
take
your
time
dan
harwood
never
doubted
that
he
loved
sally
owen
after
that
dark
day
of
sylvia
from
the
time
sylvia
stepped
from
the
train
till
the
moment
when
late
that
same
afternoon
just
as
the
shadows
were
gathering
andrew
kelton
was
buried
with
academic
and
military
honors
befitting
his
achievements
owen
had
shown
the
tenderness
of
the
gentlest
of
mothers
to
the
forlorn
girl
the
scene
at
the
grave
sank
deep
into
dan
memory
the
patriarchal
figure
of
wandless
with
the
faculty
and
undergraduates
ranged
behind
him
the
old
minister
voice
lifted
in
a
benediction
that
thrilled
with
a
note
of
triumphant
faith
and
the
hymn
sung
by
the
students
at
the
end
voices
sweet
and
clear
floating
off
into
the
sunset
and
nothing
in
dan
life
had
ever
moved
him
so
much
as
when
owen
standing
beside
sylvia
and
representing
in
her
gaunt
figure
the
whole
world
of
love
and
kindness
bent
down
at
the
very
end
and
kissed
the
sobbing
girl
and
led
her
away
harwood
called
on
owen
at
the
cottage
in
buckeye
lane
that
evening
she
came
down
from
sylvia
room
and
met
him
in
the
little
library
which
he
found
unchanged
from
the
day
of
his
visit
five
years
before
that
little
girl
is
a
hero
she
began
i
guess
she
about
the
lonesomest
girl
in
the
world
andrew
kelton
was
a
man
and
a
good
one
he
had
been
well
for
years
the
doctor
tells
me
trouble
with
his
heart
but
he
kept
it
to
himself
did
want
to
worry
the
girl
i
tell
you
everything
helps
at
a
time
like
this
admiral
martin
came
over
to
represent
the
navy
and
you
saw
the
there
it
caught
me
in
the
throat
when
the
bugle
blew
for
andrew
sylvia
will
rally
and
go
on
and
do
some
big
thing
it
in
her
i
reckon
she
have
to
go
back
to
college
this
being
her
last
year
too
bad
the
commencement
all
spoiled
for
her
yes
she
wo
have
much
heart
for
it
but
she
must
get
her
degree
she
need
a
rest
after
this
i
go
back
with
her
and
then
going
to
take
her
up
to
waupegan
with
me
for
the
summer
there
are
some
things
to
settle
about
her
and
i
glad
you
stayed
andrew
owned
this
house
but
i
should
think
sylvia
would
want
to
keep
it
houses
in
a
town
like
this
are
a
nuisance
if
you
do
live
where
you
can
watch
the
tenants
she
went
on
her
practical
mind
asserting
itself
i
suppose
dan
began
and
then
hesitated
it
gave
him
a
curious
feeling
to
be
talking
of
sylvia
affairs
in
this
way
go
on
daniel
this
marked
a
departure
she
had
never
called
him
by
his
first
name
before
i
closer
to
that
girl
than
anybody
and
glad
to
talk
to
you
about
her
affairs
i
suppose
there
will
be
something
for
her
she
not
thrown
on
her
own
resources
i
guess
he
did
make
any
will
but
what
he
left
is
sylvia
he
had
a
brother
in
los
angeles
who
died
ten
years
ago
he
was
a
rich
man
and
left
a
big
fortune
to
his
children
if
there
no
will
there
have
to
be
an
administrator
sylvia
of
age
and
she
wo
need
a
guardian
dan
nodded
he
knew
owen
well
enough
by
this
time
to
understand
that
she
usually
perfected
her
plans
before
speaking
and
that
she
doubtless
had
decided
exactly
how
andrew
kelton
estate
should
be
administered
i
going
to
ask
the
court
to
appoint
you
administrator
daniel
you
ever
acted
well
you
might
as
well
have
the
experience
i
might
take
it
myself
but
i
pretty
busy
and
there
be
some
running
back
and
forth
to
do
you
come
back
in
a
day
or
two
and
we
see
how
things
stand
by
that
time
as
soon
as
sylvia
gets
rested
she
go
back
to
college
to
finish
up
and
then
come
to
me
for
the
summer
she
might
not
like
my
having
anything
to
do
with
her
affairs
dan
suggested
i
should
want
to
seem
to
be
intruding
oh
sylvia
likes
you
well
enough
the
main
thing
is
getting
somebody
that
you
got
confidence
in
i
know
some
people
here
and
i
guess
the
court
will
do
about
what
we
want
i
should
have
to
come
over
here
frequently
until
everything
was
settled
dan
added
thinking
of
his
duties
in
the
city
i
suppose
if
you
find
it
possible
for
me
to
serve
that
i
shall
have
to
get
bassett
consent
he
pays
for
my
time
you
know
that
right
you
ask
him
but
be
sure
to
tell
him
that
i
want
it
to
be
that
way
morton
wo
make
any
fuss
about
it
i
guess
you
do
enough
work
for
him
what
he
paying
you
daniel
eighteen
hundred
since
he
got
the
receivership
she
made
no
comment
but
received
the
intelligence
in
silence
he
knew
from
the
characteristic
quick
movement
of
her
eyelids
that
she
was
pondering
the
equity
of
this
carefully
and
his
loyalty
to
bassett
asserting
itself
he
added
defensively
it
more
than
i
could
begin
to
make
any
other
way
and
he
really
generous
about
my
time
he
made
it
plain
that
he
wants
me
to
keep
up
my
reading
they
do
read
much
after
they
admitted
do
they
i
thought
when
you
got
admitted
you
knew
it
all
not
if
you
mean
to
be
a
real
lawyer
said
dan
smiling
well
i
guess
you
had
better
go
now
i
do
want
to
leave
sylvia
alone
up
there
poor
little
girl
i
let
you
know
when
to
come
back
chapter
xv
a
surprise
at
the
country
club
that
all
right
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
serve
owen
in
any
way
it
a
good
deal
of
a
compliment
that
she
thought
of
you
in
that
connection
go
ahead
and
call
on
me
if
i
can
help
you
you
have
to
furnish
local
bondsmen
see
what
required
and
let
me
know
such
was
bassett
reply
when
harwood
asked
his
permission
to
serve
as
administrator
of
andrew
kelton
estate
bassett
was
a
busy
man
and
his
domestic
affairs
often
gave
him
concern
he
had
talked
to
harwood
a
good
deal
about
marian
several
times
in
fits
of
anger
at
her
extravagance
his
wife
retired
fitfully
to
sanatoriums
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
undertake
the
supervision
of
his
children
schooling
blackford
was
safe
for
the
time
in
a
military
school
and
marian
had
been
tutored
for
a
year
at
home
the
idea
of
a
college
course
for
marian
had
been
since
sylvia
appeared
a
mania
with
bassett
marian
had
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
matter
and
bassett
was
weary
of
the
struggle
and
sick
of
the
idea
that
only
by
a
college
career
for
her
could
money
be
assured
to
his
children
bassett
being
now
at
a
rest
cure
in
connecticut
and
bassett
much
away
from
home
and
seeing
nothing
to
be
gained
by
keeping
his
daughter
at
fraserville
had
persuaded
miss
waring
to
take
her
as
a
special
student
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
school
but
permitted
to
elect
her
own
studies
it
was
only
because
bassett
was
a
man
she
liked
to
please
that
the
principal
accepted
marian
now
eighteen
years
old
on
this
anomalous
basis
marian
was
relieved
to
find
herself
freed
of
the
horror
of
college
but
she
wished
to
be
launched
at
once
upon
a
social
career
and
the
capital
and
not
fraserville
must
be
the
scene
of
her
introduction
bassett
was
merely
tiding
over
the
difficult
situation
until
his
wife
should
be
able
to
deal
with
it
marian
undoubtedly
wheedled
her
father
a
good
deal
in
the
manner
of
handsome
and
willful
daughters
she
had
rarely
experienced
his
anger
but
the
remembrance
of
these
occasions
rose
before
her
as
the
shadowy
background
of
any
filial
awe
she
may
be
said
to
have
had
bassett
asked
dan
to
accompany
him
and
marian
to
the
country
club
for
dinner
one
evening
while
harwood
still
waited
for
owen
summons
to
montgomery
picking
up
marian
at
miss
waring
they
drove
out
early
and
indulged
in
a
loitering
walk
along
the
towpath
of
the
old
canal
not
returning
to
the
clubhouse
until
after
seven
when
they
had
found
a
table
on
the
veranda
dan
turned
his
head
slightly
and
saw
thatcher
allen
and
pettit
the
fraserville
editor
lounging
in
ease
at
a
table
in
a
dim
corner
why
there
thatcher
exclaimed
marian
and
if
that
is
pettit
i
did
know
he
ever
broke
into
a
place
like
this
they
all
bowed
to
the
trio
thatcher
waved
his
hand
pettit
observed
bassett
dryly
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
likely
to
break
in
anywhere
his
manner
betrayed
no
surprise
he
asked
marian
to
order
dinner
and
bowed
to
a
tableful
of
golfers
where
an
acquaintance
was
whispering
his
name
to
some
guests
from
out
of
town
it
was
the
least
bit
surprising
that
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
should
be
dining
at
the
country
club
with
edward
thatcher
and
yet
it
was
possible
to
read
too
much
seriousness
into
the
situation
harwood
was
immensely
interested
but
he
knew
it
was
bassett
way
to
betray
no
trepidation
at
even
such
a
curious
conjunction
of
planets
as
this
dan
was
in
fact
relieved
that
bassett
had
found
the
men
together
bassett
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
might
make
what
he
pleased
of
this
sudden
intimacy
marian
had
scorned
the
table
dinner
and
was
choosing
from
the
special
offerings
green
turtle
soup
and
guinea
fowl
as
affording
a
pleasant
relief
from
the
austere
regimen
of
miss
waring
table
the
roasting
of
the
guinea
hen
would
require
thirty
minutes
the
waiter
warned
them
but
bassett
made
no
objection
marian
thereupon
interjected
a
postscript
of
frogs
legs
between
soup
and
roast
and
bassett
cheerfully
acquiesced
you
seem
to
be
picking
the
most
musical
birds
offered
he
remarked
amiably
i
do
believe
i
eat
the
rest
of
the
olives
if
i
were
you
why
does
allen
thatcher
come
over
here
and
speak
to
us
i
like
to
know
asked
marian
you
would
think
he
ever
seen
us
before
the
three
men
having
dined
had
from
appearances
been
idling
at
the
table
for
some
time
pettit
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
regaling
his
two
auditors
with
tales
from
his
abundant
store
of
anecdotes
at
the
end
of
a
story
at
which
thatcher
had
guffawed
loudly
they
rose
and
crossed
the
veranda
hearing
them
approaching
bassett
rose
promptly
and
they
shook
hands
all
round
if
there
were
any
embarrassments
in
the
meeting
for
the
older
men
it
was
concealed
under
the
cordiality
of
their
greetings
pettit
took
charge
of
the
situation
well
sir
he
boomed
i
might
known
that
if
i
came
to
town
and
broke
into
sassiety
i
get
caught
at
it
you
ca
get
away
from
home
folks
thatcher
has
filled
me
amply
with
expensive
urban
food
in
this
sylvan
retreat
nectar
and
ambrosia
i
even
as
one
who
drinks
deep
of
the
waters
of
life
and
throws
the
dipper
in
the
well
just
come
to
town
and
wander
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
and
your
neighbor
will
catch
you
every
time
fact
is
i
lectured
on
humor
in
churubusco
last
night
and
am
lifting
the
spirits
of
brazil
this
will
be
all
from
ike
pettit
the
fraserville
funny
man
until
the
wheat
safe
and
our
chautauquas
pitch
their
tents
in
green
fields
far
away
reminds
me
of
what
dan
voorhees
said
once
dear
old
dan
voorhees
i
almost
cry
when
i
think
o
dan
well
as
i
was
saying
did
know
you
were
in
town
mort
thatcher
interrupted
i
been
in
chicago
a
week
and
only
got
back
this
evening
i
found
your
esteemed
fellow
townsman
about
to
hit
a
lunch
downtown
and
thought
it
best
to
draw
him
away
from
the
lights
of
the
great
city
this
was
apology
or
explanation
as
one
chose
to
take
it
bassett
was
apparently
unmoved
by
it
i
been
in
town
a
day
or
two
i
do
live
in
the
way
you
do
ed
i
keep
to
the
main
traveled
road
the
straight
and
narrow
path
as
our
brother
calls
it
said
bassett
well
i
going
to
quit
working
myself
to
death
it
getting
too
hot
for
poker
and
i
almost
driven
to
lead
a
wholesome
life
the
thought
pains
me
mort
marian
had
opened
briskly
upon
allen
she
wanted
to
know
whether
he
had
passed
the
school
the
night
before
with
a
girl
in
a
blue
hat
she
had
been
sure
it
was
he
and
his
denial
only
intensified
her
belief
that
she
had
seen
him
she
had
wagered
a
box
of
caramels
with
her
roommate
that
it
was
allen
how
dare
he
deny
it
and
cause
her
to
lose
a
dollar
of
her
allowance
allen
said
the
least
he
could
do
would
be
to
send
the
candy
himself
a
proposition
which
she
declared
in
a
horrified
whisper
he
must
put
from
his
thoughts
forever
candy
it
appeared
was
contraband
at
miss
waring
bassett
ignoring
the
vivacious
colloquy
between
his
daughter
and
allen
continued
to
exchange
commonplaces
with
thatcher
and
pettit
marian
ease
of
manner
amused
harwood
allen
was
bending
over
her
in
his
eager
way
there
was
no
question
but
that
he
admired
her
tremendously
the
situation
was
greatly
to
her
liking
and
she
was
making
the
most
of
it
it
was
in
her
eye
that
she
knew
how
to
manage
men
seeing
that
thatcher
was
edging
away
she
played
upon
him
to
delay
his
escape
i
wish
you
would
come
up
to
waupegan
this
summer
thatcher
you
and
father
are
such
friends
and
we
should
all
be
so
glad
to
have
you
for
a
neighbor
there
are
always
houses
to
be
rented
you
know
stranger
things
have
happened
than
that
miss
marian
replied
thatcher
eying
her
boldly
and
quite
satisfied
with
her
appearance
my
women
folks
want
allen
and
me
to
come
across
for
the
summer
but
we
like
this
side
of
the
big
water
little
old
united
states
nothing
touches
it
allen
and
i
may
take
a
run
up
into
canada
sometime
when
it
gets
red
hot
reminds
me
speaking
of
the
heat
back
in
the
hancock
campaign
pettit
was
beginning
but
thatcher
was
leaving
and
the
editor
and
allen
followed
perforce
in
a
moment
they
heard
thatcher
voice
peremptorily
demanding
his
motor
from
the
steps
of
the
entrance
pettit
lecture
dates
must
be
multiplying
observed
dan
carelessly
they
seem
to
be
bassett
replied
indifferently
i
can
find
out
easily
enough
whether
he
lectured
at
churubusco
last
night
or
not
or
is
going
to
invade
brazil
dan
suggested
easy
but
unnecessary
i
think
i
know
what
in
your
mind
bassett
answered
as
marian
interested
in
the
passing
show
turned
away
but
it
is
of
the
slightest
importance
one
way
or
another
that
was
miss
bosworth
announced
marian
the
one
in
the
white
flannel
coat
she
certainly
grand
to
look
at
please
keep
your
eyes
to
the
front
bassett
admonished
you
stare
at
people
marian
and
then
having
dismissed
pettit
and
feeling
called
upon
to
bring
his
daughter
into
the
conversation
he
said
marian
you
remember
the
miss
garrison
your
aunt
is
so
fond
of
her
grandfather
died
the
other
day
and
miss
garrison
had
to
come
home
your
aunt
sally
is
in
montgomery
with
her
now
harwood
went
to
the
funeral
that
too
bad
said
marian
at
once
interested
sylvia
a
mighty
nice
girl
and
i
guess
her
grandfather
had
just
about
raised
her
from
what
she
told
me
i
wonder
what
she
going
to
do
she
asked
turning
to
harwood
she
going
back
to
college
to
take
her
degree
and
then
owen
is
going
to
have
her
at
waupegan
this
summer
oh
i
did
know
aunt
sally
was
going
to
open
her
house
this
summer
said
marian
clearly
surprised
it
must
be
just
that
she
wants
to
have
sylvia
with
her
they
the
best
kind
of
pals
and
of
course
aunt
sally
and
the
old
professor
were
friends
all
their
lives
i
glad
going
to
be
at
the
lake
she
will
help
some
she
concluded
you
do
mean
that
you
tired
of
the
lake
asked
harwood
noting
the
with
which
she
had
concluded
i
thought
all
waupegan
people
preferred
it
to
the
maine
coast
or
europe
oh
i
suppose
they
do
said
marian
but
i
think
i
could
live
through
a
season
somewhere
else
it
will
be
good
fun
to
have
aunt
sally
house
open
again
she
must
be
making
money
out
of
that
farm
now
i
suppose
sylvia
grandfather
did
have
much
money
still
sylvia
the
kind
of
girl
that
would
much
mind
not
having
money
she
is
much
for
style
but
she
does
know
an
awful
lot
do
you
think
a
girl
may
be
stylish
and
know
a
lot
too
asked
her
father
i
suppose
it
possible
the
girl
assented
with
a
reluctance
that
caused
both
men
to
laugh
let
me
see
papa
you
did
see
sylvia
that
summer
she
was
at
the
lake
that
was
the
summer
you
played
a
trick
on
us
and
only
spent
a
day
at
waupegan
yes
i
remember
now
you
came
home
from
colorado
and
said
hello
and
skipped
the
next
morning
of
course
you
did
see
sylvia
oh
yes
i
did
replied
bassett
i
remember
her
very
well
indeed
i
quite
agree
with
your
mother
and
aunt
sally
that
she
is
an
exceedingly
fine
girl
she
certainly
discouraged
me
a
good
deal
about
college
four
years
of
school
after
you
seventeen
or
eighteen
not
for
marian
and
she
shook
her
head
drolly
bassett
was
either
absorbed
in
thought
or
he
chose
to
ignore
remark
he
was
silent
for
some
time
and
the
girl
went
on
banteringly
with
harwood
she
availed
herself
of
all
those
immunities
and
privileges
which
the
gods
confer
upon
young
women
whom
they
endow
with
good
looks
in
the
of
the
past
year
she
had
bought
her
own
clothes
with
only
the
nominal
supervision
of
miss
waring
assistant
and
in
her
new
spring
raiment
she
was
very
much
the
young
lady
and
decidedly
a
modish
one
dan
glanced
from
her
to
the
young
people
at
a
neighboring
table
among
the
girls
in
the
party
none
was
prettier
or
more
charmingly
gowned
than
marian
in
the
light
of
this
proximity
he
watched
her
with
a
new
attention
and
he
saw
that
her
father
too
studied
her
covertly
as
though
realizing
that
he
had
a
grown
daughter
on
his
hands
her
way
with
harwood
was
not
without
coquetry
she
tapped
his
arm
with
her
fan
lightly
when
he
refused
to
enter
into
a
discussion
of
his
attentions
of
which
she
protested
she
knew
much
to
miss
bosworth
he
admitted
having
called
on
miss
bosworth
once
her
brother
was
a
yale
man
and
had
asked
him
to
the
house
on
the
score
of
that
tie
but
marian
knew
much
better
she
was
sure
that
he
was
devoting
himself
to
miss
bosworth
every
one
said
that
he
was
becoming
a
great
society
man
she
had
wearied
of
his
attitude
toward
her
except
the
callow
youth
of
fraserville
and
the
boys
she
had
known
all
the
summers
of
her
life
at
waupegan
harwood
and
allen
thatcher
were
the
only
young
men
she
knew
in
her
later
freedom
at
school
she
had
made
the
office
telephone
a
nuisance
to
him
but
he
sympathized
with
her
discreetly
in
her
perplexities
several
times
she
had
appealed
to
him
to
help
her
out
of
financial
difficulties
confiding
to
him
tragically
that
if
certain
bills
reached
fraserville
she
would
be
ruined
forever
marian
found
the
country
club
highly
diverting
it
gave
her
visions
of
the
social
life
of
the
capital
of
which
she
had
only
vaguely
dreamed
she
knew
many
people
by
sight
who
were
socially
prominent
and
she
longed
to
be
of
their
number
it
pleased
her
to
find
that
her
father
who
was
a
member
and
a
rare
visitor
at
the
club
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
she
liked
to
think
him
a
celebrity
the
speaker
of
the
house
in
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly
came
out
and
asked
bassett
to
meet
some
men
with
whom
he
had
been
dining
in
the
rathskeller
while
her
father
was
away
marian
with
elbows
resting
on
the
table
her
firm
round
chin
touching
her
lightly
interlaced
fingers
gave
a
capital
imitation
of
a
girl
making
herself
agreeable
to
a
young
man
dan
was
well
hardened
to
her
cajoleries
by
this
time
he
was
confident
that
she
would
have
made
sweet
eyes
at
caliban
harwood
smoking
the
cigar
bassett
had
ordered
for
him
compared
favorably
with
other
young
men
who
had
dawned
upon
marian
horizon
like
most
western
boys
who
go
east
to
college
he
had
acquired
the
habit
of
careful
pressing
and
brushing
and
combing
his
lean
face
had
a
certain
distinction
and
he
was
unfailingly
courteous
and
this
will
be
tough
on
mama
she
observed
casually
pray
be
more
explicit
oh
aunt
sally
having
sylvia
up
there
at
the
lake
again
why
should
she
have
her
there
if
she
wants
her
i
thought
your
mother
admired
sylvia
i
gathered
that
ray
of
light
somewhere
from
you
or
mrs
owen
oh
mama
was
beautiful
to
her
but
i
shall
always
think
just
between
you
and
me
and
that
spoon
that
it
was
aunt
sally
asking
sylvia
to
the
lake
that
time
that
gave
mama
nervous
prostration
nonsense
i
advise
you
as
an
old
friend
not
to
say
such
things
better
not
even
think
them
well
it
was
after
that
when
she
saw
that
aunt
sally
had
taken
up
sylvia
that
mama
got
that
bug
about
having
me
go
to
college
she
got
the
notion
that
it
was
sylvia
intellectual
gifts
that
interested
aunt
sally
and
mama
thought
i
better
improve
my
mind
and
get
into
the
competition
you
thought
your
mother
was
jealous
i
call
that
very
unkind
it
not
the
way
to
speak
of
your
mother
well
if
you
want
to
be
nasty
and
lecture
me
go
ahead
harwood
you
must
like
sylvia
pretty
well
yourself
you
took
her
back
to
college
once
and
had
no
end
of
a
lark
i
got
that
from
aunt
sally
so
you
need
deny
it
humph
of
course
i
like
sylvia
any
one
bound
to
but
if
aunt
sally
leaves
her
all
her
money
just
because
she
so
bright
and
educated
and
cuts
me
off
then
what
would
be
the
answer
i
should
have
anything
to
say
about
it
it
would
be
owen
that
did
the
saying
laughed
dan
why
did
you
meet
the
competition
and
go
to
college
you
have
brains
but
you
do
seem
interested
in
anything
but
keeping
amused
i
suppose
she
answered
petulantly
it
would
please
you
to
see
me
go
to
teaching
a
kindergarten
or
something
like
that
not
for
marian
going
to
see
life
and
she
added
ruefully
if
i
get
the
chance
why
does
papa
leave
fraserville
and
come
to
the
city
they
say
he
can
have
any
political
office
he
wants
and
he
ought
to
run
for
governor
or
something
like
that
just
on
my
account
i
dare
say
he
just
waiting
for
you
to
suggest
it
why
not
the
presidency
you
could
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
the
white
house
ordering
the
army
around
and
using
the
battleships
to
play
with
the
governorship
and
trifles
like
that
would
only
bore
you
do
be
silly
the
newspapers
print
most
horrible
things
about
papa
which
are
true
of
course
they
newspaper
lies
but
if
he
lets
them
say
all
those
things
he
ought
to
get
something
to
pay
for
it
he
only
a
state
senator
from
the
jayest
county
in
indiana
it
makes
me
tired
the
girl
keen
penetration
had
often
surprised
and
it
had
sometimes
appalled
harwood
in
the
curious
intimacy
that
had
grown
up
between
them
her
intuitions
were
active
and
she
had
a
daring
imagination
he
wondered
whether
bassett
was
fully
aware
of
the
problem
marian
presented
dan
had
never
ventured
to
suggest
a
sharper
discipline
for
the
girl
except
on
the
occasion
when
he
had
caught
her
walking
with
allen
in
the
park
he
had
regretted
his
interference
afterward
for
bassett
anger
had
seemed
to
him
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offense
like
most
indifferent
or
indulgent
parents
bassett
was
prone
to
excesses
in
his
fitful
experiments
in
discipline
dan
had
resolved
not
to
meddle
again
but
marian
was
undeniably
a
provoking
young
person
it
had
been
suggested
to
him
of
late
by
one
or
two
of
his
intimates
that
in
due
course
of
events
he
would
of
course
marry
his
employer
daughter
as
she
faced
him
across
the
table
the
pink
light
of
the
adding
to
the
glow
of
health
in
her
pretty
cheeks
she
caused
him
to
start
by
the
abruptness
with
which
she
said
i
do
see
much
ahead
of
me
but
to
get
married
do
you
if
you
put
it
up
to
me
i
do
see
anything
ahead
of
you
unless
you
take
a
different
view
of
life
you
never
seem
to
have
a
serious
thought
harwood
you
can
be
immensely
unpleasant
when
you
choose
to
be
you
talk
to
me
as
though
i
were
only
nine
years
old
you
ought
to
see
that
i
very
unhappy
i
the
oldest
girl
at
miss
waring
locked
up
there
with
a
lot
of
little
pigeons
that
coo
every
time
you
look
at
them
they
treat
me
as
though
i
were
their
grandmother
why
do
you
say
all
these
things
to
your
father
asked
harwood
trying
to
laugh
i
dare
say
he
do
anything
you
like
but
please
cheer
up
those
people
over
there
will
think
we
having
a
terrible
quarrel
the
fact
that
they
were
drawing
the
glances
of
miss
bosworth
party
pleased
her
she
had
been
perfectly
conscious
of
it
all
the
time
well
they
wo
think
you
making
to
me
harwood
that
to
console
you
and
she
added
icily
settling
back
in
her
chair
as
her
father
approached
i
hope
you
understand
that
i
not
even
leading
you
on
chapter
xvi
stop
look
listen
bassett
and
atwill
held
a
conference
the
next
day
and
the
interview
was
one
of
length
the
manager
of
the
courier
came
to
the
office
in
the
boordman
building
at
eleven
and
when
harwood
went
to
luncheon
at
one
the
door
had
not
been
opened
miss
farrell
returning
from
her
midday
repast
pointed
to
the
closed
door
lifted
her
brows
and
held
up
her
forefinger
to
express
surprise
and
caution
miss
prescience
was
astonishing
of
women
she
held
the
lightest
opinion
dan
had
learned
her
concern
was
with
the
affairs
of
men
harwood
intent
upon
the
compilation
of
a
report
of
the
receivership
was
nevertheless
mindful
of
the
unwonted
length
of
the
conference
when
he
returned
from
luncheon
bassett
had
gone
but
he
reappeared
at
three
and
a
little
later
atwill
came
back
and
the
door
closed
again
this
second
interview
was
short
but
it
seemed
to
leave
bassett
in
a
meditative
frame
of
mind
wishing
to
discuss
some
points
in
the
trial
balance
of
the
receiver
accountant
harwood
entered
and
found
bassett
with
his
hat
on
slowly
pacing
the
floor
yes
all
right
come
in
he
said
as
harwood
hesitated
he
at
once
addressed
himself
to
the
reports
with
his
accustomed
care
bassett
carried
an
immense
amount
of
data
in
his
head
he
understood
bookkeeping
and
was
essentially
thorough
dan
constantly
found
penciled
calculations
on
the
margins
of
the
daily
reports
from
the
indicating
that
bassett
scrutinized
the
figures
carefully
and
he
promptly
questioned
any
deviation
from
the
established
average
of
loss
and
gain
bassett
threw
down
his
pencil
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
and
told
dan
to
proceed
with
the
writing
of
the
report
i
like
to
file
it
personally
so
i
can
talk
over
the
prospect
of
getting
an
order
of
sale
before
the
judge
goes
on
his
vacation
paid
the
debts
and
stopped
the
flow
of
red
ink
so
we
about
ready
to
let
go
while
they
were
talking
miss
farrell
brought
in
a
telegram
for
harwood
it
was
the
summons
from
owen
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
she
bade
him
come
to
montgomery
the
next
day
he
handed
the
message
to
bassett
go
ahead
i
go
over
there
if
you
like
and
find
you
the
necessary
bondsmen
i
know
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
at
montgomery
very
well
you
go
in
the
morning
very
well
i
stay
here
till
you
get
back
bassett
will
be
well
enough
to
leave
the
sanatorium
in
a
few
days
and
i
going
up
to
waupegan
to
get
the
house
ready
it
will
be
pleasant
for
bassett
to
have
owen
there
this
summer
anybody
is
lucky
to
have
a
woman
of
her
qualities
for
a
neighbor
she
a
noblewoman
said
bassett
impressively
and
a
good
friend
to
all
of
us
on
the
train
the
next
morning
harwood
unfolded
the
day
courier
in
the
languidly
critical
frame
of
mind
that
former
employees
of
newspapers
bring
to
the
reading
of
the
journals
they
have
served
he
scanned
the
news
columns
and
opened
to
the
editorial
page
the
leader
at
once
caught
his
eye
it
was
an
emphasis
rarely
employed
at
the
courier
office
and
was
condensed
in
a
single
brief
paragraph
that
stared
oddly
at
the
reader
under
the
caption
stop
look
listen
it
held
harwood
attention
through
a
dozen
amazed
and
mystified
readings
it
ran
thus
it
has
long
been
indiana
proud
boast
that
money
unsupported
by
honest
merit
has
never
intruded
in
her
politics
a
malign
force
threatens
to
mar
this
record
it
is
incumbent
upon
honest
men
of
all
parties
who
have
the
best
interests
of
our
state
at
heart
to
stop
look
listen
the
courier
gives
notice
that
it
is
fully
advised
of
the
intentions
and
perfectly
aware
of
the
methods
by
which
the
fair
name
of
the
hoosier
state
is
menaced
the
courier
being
thoroughly
informed
of
the
beginnings
of
this
movement
whose
purpose
is
the
seizure
of
the
democratic
party
and
the
manipulation
of
its
power
for
private
ends
will
antagonize
to
the
utmost
the
element
that
has
initiated
it
honorable
defeats
the
party
in
indiana
has
known
and
it
will
hardly
at
this
late
day
surrender
tamely
to
the
buccaneers
and
adventurers
that
seek
to
capture
its
battleflag
this
warning
will
not
be
repeated
stop
look
listen
from
internal
evidence
harwood
placed
the
authorship
readily
enough
the
paragraph
had
been
written
by
the
chief
editorial
writer
an
old
hand
at
the
game
who
indulged
frequently
in
such
terms
as
adventurer
and
buccaneer
it
was
he
who
wrote
sagely
of
foreign
affairs
and
once
caused
riotous
delight
in
the
reporters
room
by
an
editorial
on
turkish
politics
containing
the
phrase
we
hope
the
sultan
but
not
without
special
authority
would
such
an
article
have
been
planted
at
the
top
of
the
editorial
page
and
beyond
doubt
these
lines
were
the
residuum
of
bassett
long
interview
with
atwill
and
its
aim
was
unmistakable
bassett
was
thus
paying
his
compliments
to
thatcher
the
encounter
at
the
country
club
might
have
precipitated
the
crisis
but
knowing
bassett
dan
did
not
believe
that
the
courier
batteries
would
have
been
fired
on
so
little
provocation
bassett
was
not
a
man
to
shoot
wildly
in
the
dark
nor
was
he
likely
to
fire
at
all
without
being
sure
of
the
state
of
his
ammunition
chests
so
at
least
harwood
reasoned
to
himself
several
of
his
fellow
passengers
in
the
were
passing
the
courier
about
and
pointing
to
the
editorial
all
over
indiana
it
would
be
the
subject
of
discussion
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
dan
journalistic
sense
told
him
that
in
the
surrounding
capitals
it
would
not
be
ignored
if
thatcher
and
bassett
get
to
fighting
the
people
may
find
a
chance
to
sneak
in
and
get
something
a
man
behind
dan
was
saying
nope
said
another
voice
there
wo
be
core
when
those
fellows
get
through
with
the
apple
i
can
hear
the
cheering
in
the
republican
camp
this
morning
remarked
another
voice
gleefully
oh
pshaw
said
still
another
speaker
bassett
will
simply
grind
thatcher
to
powder
thatcher
has
any
business
in
politics
anyhow
and
does
know
the
game
by
george
bassett
does
and
this
is
the
first
time
he
struck
a
full
blow
since
he
got
behind
the
something
must
have
made
him
pretty
hot
though
to
have
let
off
a
scream
like
that
harwood
was
interested
in
these
remarks
because
they
indicated
a
prevalent
impression
that
bassett
dominated
the
courier
in
spite
of
the
mystery
with
which
the
ownership
of
the
paper
was
enveloped
the
only
doubt
in
harwood
own
mind
had
been
left
there
by
bassett
himself
he
recalled
now
bassett
remark
on
the
day
he
had
taken
him
into
his
confidence
in
the
ranger
county
affair
i
might
have
some
trouble
in
proving
it
myself
bassett
had
said
harwood
thought
it
strange
that
after
that
first
deliberate
confidence
and
his
introduction
to
atwill
bassett
had
in
this
important
move
ignored
him
it
was
possible
that
his
relations
with
allen
thatcher
which
bassett
knew
to
be
intimate
accounted
for
the
change
or
it
might
be
due
to
a
lessening
warmth
in
bassett
feeling
toward
him
he
recalled
now
that
bassett
had
lately
seemed
moody
a
new
development
in
the
man
from
fraser
and
that
he
had
several
times
been
abrupt
and
unreasonable
about
small
matters
in
the
office
certain
incidents
that
had
appeared
trivial
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
stood
forth
disquietingly
now
if
bassett
had
ceased
to
trust
him
there
must
be
a
cause
for
the
change
slight
manifestations
of
impatience
in
a
man
so
habitually
calm
and
rational
might
be
overlooked
but
dan
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
abrupt
cessation
of
confidential
relations
he
was
a
bit
piqued
the
more
so
that
this
astounding
editorial
indicated
a
range
and
depth
of
purpose
in
bassett
plans
that
dan
imagination
had
not
fathomed
he
tore
out
the
editorial
and
put
it
away
carefully
in
his
pocketbook
as
montgomery
was
called
a
messenger
was
at
the
station
to
guide
him
to
the
where
he
found
owen
and
sylvia
waiting
for
him
in
the
private
room
of
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
owen
had
in
her
thorough
fashion
arranged
all
the
preliminaries
she
had
found
in
akins
the
president
of
the
montgomery
national
bank
an
old
friend
and
it
was
her
way
to
use
her
friends
when
she
needed
them
at
her
instance
akins
and
another
resident
freeholder
had
already
signed
the
bond
when
dan
arrived
dan
was
amused
by
the
direct
manner
in
which
owen
addressed
the
court
the
terminology
pertaining
to
the
administration
of
estates
was
at
her
fingers
ends
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
judge
was
impressed
by
her
we
wo
need
any
lawyer
over
here
daniel
you
can
save
the
estate
lawyer
fees
by
acting
yourself
i
guess
that
will
be
all
right
judge
his
honor
said
it
would
be
people
usually
yielded
readily
to
owen
suggestions
you
can
go
up
to
the
house
now
sylvia
and
i
be
along
pretty
soon
i
want
to
make
a
memorandum
for
an
inventory
with
daniel
at
the
bank
akins
gave
them
the
directors
room
and
andrew
papers
were
produced
from
his
box
in
the
safety
vault
akins
explained
that
kelton
had
been
obliged
to
drop
life
insurance
policies
for
a
considerable
amount
only
one
policy
for
two
thousand
dollars
had
been
carried
through
there
were
a
number
of
contracts
with
publishers
covering
the
copyrights
in
kelton
mathematical
and
astronomical
textbooks
the
royalties
on
these
had
been
diminishing
steadily
the
banker
said
and
they
could
hardly
be
regarded
as
an
asset
life
insurance
two
thousand
contracts
nothing
and
the
house
is
worth
two
with
good
luck
take
it
all
in
and
i
reckon
this
all
we
be
in
luck
to
pinch
a
little
out
of
the
estate
for
sylvia
more
than
i
expected
you
think
there
ai
anything
else
mr
akins
the
professor
talked
to
me
about
his
affairs
frequently
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
there
anything
more
he
had
five
thousand
dollars
in
government
bonds
but
he
sold
them
and
bought
shares
in
that
white
river
canneries
combination
a
lot
of
our
montgomery
people
lost
money
in
that
scheme
it
promised
fifteen
per
cent
with
the
usual
result
yes
andrew
told
me
about
that
once
well
well
he
had
money
to
educate
his
granddaughter
i
do
know
how
he
raised
it
but
he
kept
it
in
a
special
account
in
the
bank
he
told
me
that
if
he
died
before
she
finished
college
that
was
to
be
applied
strictly
to
her
education
there
is
eight
hundred
dollars
left
of
that
sylvia
going
to
teach
said
owen
i
been
talking
to
her
and
she
got
her
plans
all
made
she
got
a
head
for
business
that
girl
and
nothing
can
shake
her
idea
that
she
got
a
work
to
do
in
the
world
she
knows
what
she
going
to
do
every
day
for
a
good
many
years
from
the
way
she
talks
i
had
it
all
fixed
to
take
her
with
me
up
to
waupegan
for
the
summer
thought
she
be
ready
to
take
a
rest
after
her
hard
work
at
college
and
this
blow
of
her
grandpa
dying
and
all
but
not
that
girl
she
going
to
spend
the
summer
taking
a
normal
course
in
town
to
be
ready
to
begin
teaching
in
indianapolis
next
september
i
guess
if
we
had
found
a
million
dollars
in
her
grandpa
box
it
would
have
been
the
same
when
you
talk
about
health
she
laughs
i
guess
if
there
a
healthy
woman
on
earth
it
that
girl
she
says
she
doubled
all
her
gymnasium
work
at
college
to
build
herself
up
ready
for
business
you
know
wandless
daughter
is
a
wellesley
woman
and
keeps
in
touch
with
the
college
she
wrote
home
that
sylvia
had
all
beat
a
mile
down
there
that
she
just
walked
through
everything
and
would
be
chosen
for
the
phi
beta
kappa
is
that
right
daniel
she
sort
o
throws
you
out
of
your
calculations
that
girl
does
i
counted
on
having
a
good
time
with
her
up
at
the
lake
and
now
it
looks
like
have
to
stay
in
town
all
summer
if
i
going
to
see
anything
of
her
it
was
clear
enough
that
owen
was
not
interesting
herself
in
sylvia
merely
because
the
girl
was
the
granddaughter
of
an
old
friend
she
admired
sylvia
on
her
own
account
and
was
at
no
pains
to
disguise
the
fact
the
bassett
expectations
were
dan
reflected
scarcely
at
a
premium
akins
returned
the
papers
to
the
safety
box
and
when
owen
and
harwood
were
alone
she
closed
the
door
carefully
now
daniel
she
began
opening
her
i
always
hold
that
this
is
a
funny
world
but
that
things
come
out
right
in
the
end
they
mostly
do
but
sometimes
the
devil
gets
into
things
and
it
ai
so
easy
you
believe
in
the
devil
daniel
well
my
folks
are
presbyterians
said
dan
my
own
religion
is
the
same
as
ware
i
not
sure
he
vouches
for
the
devil
it
my
firm
conviction
that
there
is
one
daniel
a
red
one
with
a
forked
tail
you
see
his
works
scattered
around
too
often
to
doubt
it
dan
nodded
owen
had
placed
carefully
under
a
weight
a
paper
she
had
taken
from
her
reticule
daniel
she
looked
around
at
the
door
again
and
dropped
her
voice
i
believe
you
a
good
man
and
a
clean
one
and
fitch
says
you
a
smart
young
man
it
as
much
because
you
a
good
man
as
because
you
got
brains
that
i
called
on
you
to
attend
to
business
now
i
going
to
tell
you
something
that
i
would
tell
anybody
else
on
earth
it
a
sacred
trust
and
i
want
you
to
feel
bound
by
a
more
solemn
oath
than
the
one
you
took
at
the
clerk
office
not
to
steal
sylvia
money
she
fixed
her
remarkably
penetrating
gaze
upon
him
so
intently
that
he
turned
uneasily
in
his
chair
it
something
somebody
who
appreciates
sylvia
as
i
think
you
do
ought
to
know
about
her
andrew
kelton
told
me
just
before
sylvia
started
to
college
the
poor
man
had
been
carrying
it
alone
till
it
broke
him
down
he
had
never
told
another
soul
i
reckon
it
was
the
hardest
job
he
ever
did
to
tell
me
and
i
would
be
telling
you
except
somebody
ought
to
know
who
in
a
position
to
help
sylvia
sort
o
look
out
for
her
and
protect
her
i
believe
and
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
his
arm
lightly
i
believe
i
can
trust
you
to
do
that
yes
mrs
owen
she
waited
until
he
had
answered
her
and
even
then
she
was
silent
lost
in
thought
professor
kelton
did
know
daniel
she
began
gravely
who
father
was
she
minimized
the
significance
of
this
by
continuing
rapidly
andrew
had
quit
the
navy
soon
after
the
war
and
came
out
here
to
madison
college
to
teach
and
his
wife
had
died
and
he
did
know
what
to
do
with
his
daughter
edna
kelton
was
a
little
headstrong
i
reckon
and
wanted
her
own
way
she
did
like
living
in
a
country
college
town
there
was
anything
here
to
interest
her
i
wo
tell
you
all
of
andrew
story
but
it
boils
down
to
just
this
that
while
edna
was
in
new
york
studying
music
she
got
married
without
telling
where
or
to
whom
andrew
never
saw
her
till
she
was
dying
in
a
hospital
and
had
a
little
girl
with
her
that
sylvia
now
whether
there
was
any
disgrace
about
it
andrew
did
know
and
we
owe
it
to
that
dead
woman
and
to
sylvia
to
believe
it
was
all
right
you
see
what
i
mean
daniel
now
that
brings
me
down
to
what
i
want
you
to
know
somebody
has
been
keeping
watch
of
sylvia
andrew
told
me
that
she
was
thinking
deeply
as
though
pondering
just
how
much
more
it
was
necessary
to
tell
him
and
before
she
spoke
she
picked
up
the
folded
paper
and
read
it
through
carefully
when
andrew
got
this
it
troubled
him
a
lot
the
idea
that
somebody
had
an
eye
on
the
girl
and
took
enough
interest
in
her
to
do
this
made
him
uneasy
sylvia
never
knew
anything
about
it
of
course
she
does
know
anything
about
anything
and
she
wo
ever
need
to
as
i
understand
you
owen
you
want
some
friend
of
hers
to
be
in
a
position
to
protect
her
if
any
one
tries
to
harm
her
you
want
to
shield
her
from
any
evil
that
might
follow
her
from
her
mother
errors
if
they
were
indeed
errors
we
have
no
right
to
assume
that
she
had
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
that
the
only
just
position
for
us
to
take
in
such
a
matter
that
right
daniel
i
knew
you
see
it
that
way
it
looks
bad
and
andrew
knew
it
looked
bad
but
at
my
age
i
ai
thinking
evil
of
people
if
i
can
help
it
if
a
woman
goes
wrong
she
pays
for
it
keeps
on
paying
after
she
paid
the
whole
mortgage
that
the
blackest
thing
in
the
world
that
a
woman
never
shakes
a
debt
like
that
the
way
a
man
can
you
foreclose
on
a
woman
and
take
away
everything
she
got
put
her
clean
through
bankruptcy
and
the
balance
is
still
against
her
but
we
ca
make
over
society
and
laws
just
sitting
here
talking
about
it
i
reckon
edna
kelton
suffered
enough
but
we
do
want
sylvia
to
suffer
she
entitled
to
a
happy
life
and
we
do
want
any
shadows
hanging
over
her
now
that
her
grandpa
gone
she
ca
go
behind
what
he
told
her
poor
man
he
had
trouble
enough
answering
the
questions
she
had
a
right
to
ask
and
he
had
to
lie
to
her
some
yes
i
suppose
she
will
be
content
now
she
will
feel
that
what
he
did
tell
her
she
will
never
know
she
not
a
morbid
person
and
wo
be
likely
to
bother
about
it
no
i
ai
afraid
of
her
brooding
on
what
she
does
know
it
the
fear
it
may
fly
up
and
strike
her
when
she
ai
looking
that
worries
me
and
it
worried
the
professor
too
that
was
why
he
told
me
i
guess
when
he
talked
to
me
that
time
he
knew
his
heart
was
going
to
stop
suddenly
some
day
and
he
got
a
hint
that
somebody
was
interested
in
watching
sylvia
sort
o
keeping
track
of
her
and
there
was
conscience
in
it
whoever
it
is
or
was
had
got
clean
away
from
what
he
done
now
i
had
a
narrow
escape
from
letting
sylvia
see
this
letter
it
was
stuck
away
in
a
tin
box
in
andrew
bedroom
along
with
his
commissions
in
the
navy
i
was
poking
round
the
house
thinking
there
might
be
things
it
would
be
better
not
to
show
sylvia
and
i
struck
this
box
and
there
was
this
letter
stuck
away
in
the
middle
of
the
package
i
gave
sylvia
the
commissions
but
she
did
see
this
i
do
want
to
burn
it
till
you
seen
it
this
must
have
been
what
andrew
spoke
to
me
about
that
time
it
was
hardly
before
that
and
it
might
have
been
later
you
see
it
is
dated
he
started
to
tear
it
up
but
changed
his
mind
so
now
we
got
to
pass
on
it
she
pushed
the
letter
across
the
table
to
harwood
and
he
read
it
through
carefully
he
turned
it
over
after
the
first
reading
and
the
word
declined
written
firmly
and
underscored
held
him
long
so
long
that
he
started
when
owen
roused
him
with
well
daniel
he
knew
before
he
had
finished
reading
that
it
was
he
who
had
borne
the
letter
to
the
cottage
in
buckeye
lane
unless
there
had
been
a
series
of
such
communications
which
was
unlikely
on
the
face
of
it
owen
had
herself
offered
confirmation
by
placing
the
delivery
of
the
dateless
letter
five
years
earlier
the
internal
evidence
in
the
phrases
prescribing
the
manner
in
which
the
verbal
reply
was
to
be
sent
and
the
indorsement
on
the
back
of
the
sheet
were
additional
corroboration
it
was
almost
unimaginable
that
the
letter
should
have
come
again
to
his
hand
he
realized
the
importance
and
significance
of
the
sheet
of
paper
with
the
swiftness
of
a
lightning
flash
but
beyond
the
intelligence
conveyed
by
the
letter
itself
there
was
still
the
darkness
to
grope
in
his
wits
had
never
worked
so
rapidly
in
his
life
he
felt
his
heart
beating
uncomfortably
the
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
forehead
and
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
face
it
certainly
very
curious
very
curious
indeed
he
said
with
all
the
calmness
he
could
muster
but
it
does
tell
us
much
it
was
intended
to
tell
anything
said
owen
whoever
wrote
that
letter
as
i
told
you
was
troubled
about
sylvia
i
reckon
it
was
a
man
and
i
guess
it
fair
to
assume
that
he
felt
under
obligations
but
had
the
nerve
to
face
as
obligations
is
that
the
way
it
strikes
you
illustration
whoever
wrote
that
letter
was
troubled
about
sylvia
that
seems
clear
enough
he
replied
lamely
he
made
a
pretense
of
rereading
the
letter
but
only
detached
phrases
penetrated
to
his
consciousness
his
imagination
was
in
rebellion
against
the
curbing
to
which
he
strove
to
subject
it
when
he
had
borne
his
answer
back
to
fitch
office
and
been
discharged
with
the
generous
payment
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
his
services
as
messenger
just
what
had
been
the
further
history
of
the
transaction
he
had
so
far
controlled
his
agitation
that
he
was
able
to
continue
discussing
the
letter
formally
with
the
kind
old
woman
who
had
placed
the
clue
in
his
hands
he
was
little
experienced
in
the
difficult
art
of
conversing
with
half
a
mind
and
a
direct
question
from
owen
roused
him
to
the
necessity
of
heeding
what
she
was
saying
he
had
resolved
however
that
he
would
not
tell
her
of
his
own
connection
with
the
message
that
lay
on
the
table
before
them
he
needed
time
in
which
to
consider
he
must
not
add
a
pebble
weight
to
an
avalanche
that
might
go
crashing
down
upon
the
innocent
his
training
had
made
him
wary
of
circumstantial
evidence
after
all
it
was
possible
that
this
was
not
the
letter
he
had
carried
to
professor
kelton
it
would
be
very
like
owen
if
she
saw
that
anything
could
be
gained
by
such
a
course
to
go
direct
to
fitch
and
demand
to
know
the
source
of
the
offer
that
had
passed
through
his
hands
so
mysteriously
but
fitch
had
not
known
the
contents
of
the
letter
or
he
had
said
as
much
to
harwood
there
was
also
the
consideration
and
not
the
lightest
that
dan
was
bound
in
honor
to
maintain
the
secrecy
fitch
had
imposed
upon
him
the
lawyer
had
confided
the
errand
to
him
in
the
belief
that
he
would
accept
the
mission
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
entrusted
to
him
and
his
part
in
the
transaction
was
a
matter
between
himself
and
fitch
and
did
not
concern
owen
in
any
way
whatever
no
possible
benefit
could
accrue
to
sylvia
from
a
disclosure
of
his
suspicion
that
he
had
borne
the
letter
to
her
grandfather
owen
had
given
him
the
letter
that
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
protect
sylvia
and
there
was
nothing
incompatible
between
this
confidence
and
his
duty
to
fitch
who
continued
to
be
a
kind
and
helpful
friend
he
dreaded
the
outcome
of
an
interview
between
this
shrewd
penetrating
and
indomitable
woman
and
the
lawyer
the
letter
cold
and
colorless
in
what
it
failed
to
say
and
torn
half
across
to
mark
the
indecision
of
the
old
professor
had
in
it
a
great
power
for
mischief
while
harwood
mind
was
busy
with
these
reflections
he
had
been
acquiescing
in
various
speculations
in
which
owen
had
been
indulging
without
really
being
conscious
of
their
import
i
do
know
that
any
good
can
come
of
keeping
the
letter
daniel
i
reckon
we
might
as
well
tear
it
up
you
and
i
know
what
it
is
and
been
studying
it
for
a
couple
of
days
without
seeing
where
any
good
can
come
of
holding
it
you
might
burn
it
in
the
grate
there
and
we
both
know
it
out
of
the
way
i
guess
that
person
feels
that
he
done
his
whole
duty
in
making
the
offer
and
he
wo
be
likely
to
bother
any
more
that
conscience
was
a
long
time
getting
waked
up
and
having
done
that
much
it
probably
went
to
sleep
again
there
nothing
sleeps
as
sound
as
a
conscience
i
reckon
and
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
mine
took
a
nap
occasionally
better
burn
that
little
document
daniel
and
we
be
rid
of
it
and
try
to
forget
it
no
i
do
believe
i
do
that
he
said
slowly
it
might
be
better
to
hold
on
to
it
at
least
until
the
estate
is
closed
up
you
ca
tell
what
behind
it
and
then
groping
for
a
plausible
reason
he
added
the
author
of
the
letter
may
be
in
a
position
to
annoy
sylvia
by
filing
a
claim
against
the
professor
estate
or
something
of
that
kind
better
not
to
destroy
the
only
thing
we
have
that
might
help
if
that
should
occur
i
believe
it
best
to
hold
on
to
it
till
the
settled
this
was
pretty
lame
as
he
realized
but
his
caution
pleased
her
and
she
acquiesced
she
was
anxious
to
leave
no
ground
for
anyone
to
rob
sylvia
of
her
money
and
if
there
was
any
remote
possibility
that
the
letter
might
add
to
the
girl
security
she
was
willing
that
it
should
be
retained
she
sent
dan
out
into
the
bank
for
an
envelope
and
when
it
was
brought
sealed
up
the
letter
and
addressed
it
to
dan
in
her
own
hand
and
marked
it
private
you
take
good
care
of
that
daniel
and
when
you
get
the
estate
closed
up
you
burn
it
yes
it
can
do
no
harm
to
hold
it
a
little
while
he
said
with
affected
lightness
chapter
xvii
a
stroll
across
the
campus
dan
joined
owen
and
sylvia
at
the
cottage
later
he
was
to
see
them
off
in
the
morning
and
he
exerted
himself
to
make
sylvia
last
evening
in
buckeye
lane
as
happy
as
possible
the
cottage
was
to
be
left
in
the
care
of
the
old
servant
until
it
could
be
disposed
of
mary
herself
was
to
be
provided
for
in
some
way
sylvia
and
owen
had
decided
that
this
was
only
fair
and
right
after
tea
owen
said
she
had
letters
to
write
and
carried
her
portfolio
to
the
library
for
the
purpose
dan
and
sylvia
being
thus
left
to
themselves
he
proposed
a
stroll
across
the
campus
there
something
about
a
campus
he
said
as
they
started
out
there
a
likeness
in
all
of
them
or
maybe
it
sentiment
that
binds
them
together
wellesley
speaks
to
yale
and
the
language
of
both
is
understood
by
madison
ah
there
the
proof
of
it
now
integer
vitæ
scelerisque
purus
a
dozen
students
lounging
on
the
steps
of
the
library
had
begun
to
sing
the
latin
words
to
a
familiar
air
dan
followed
in
his
deep
bass
to
the
end
the
words
are
the
words
of
horace
but
the
tune
is
the
tune
of
eli
with
thanks
to
fleming
he
remarked
it
that
sort
of
thing
that
makes
college
worth
while
i
wager
those
are
seniors
who
already
feel
a
little
heartache
because
their
college
years
are
so
nearly
over
i
getting
to
be
an
old
grad
myself
but
those
songs
still
give
me
a
twinge
i
understand
that
said
sylvia
i
soon
be
saying
to
girls
i
may
never
see
again
or
when
i
meet
them
at
a
reunion
in
five
or
ten
years
they
be
different
college
is
only
the
beginning
after
all
it
only
the
beginning
but
for
some
fellows
it
the
end
too
it
scares
me
to
see
how
many
of
my
classmates
are
already
caught
in
the
undertow
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
i
not
going
under
myself
sylvia
turned
toward
him
i
rather
imagine
that
you
a
strong
swimmer
it
would
surprise
me
if
you
did
do
something
pretty
big
owen
thinks
you
will
she
not
a
person
for
any
one
to
disappoint
oh
she
has
a
way
of
thinking
in
large
totals
of
people
she
likes
and
she
does
like
me
most
unaccountably
she
has
real
illusions
about
laughed
sylvia
she
has
an
idea
that
colleges
do
things
by
magic
and
i
afraid
she
will
find
out
that
the
wand
did
touch
me
you
did
need
the
wand
magic
he
answered
for
you
are
a
woman
of
genius
which
sounds
well
harwood
no
one
ever
used
such
words
to
me
before
i
learned
one
thing
though
that
patience
and
work
will
make
up
for
a
good
many
lacks
there
are
some
things
i
going
to
try
to
do
they
loitered
in
the
quiet
paths
of
the
campus
bright
college
years
followed
them
from
the
singers
at
the
library
if
there
any
sentiment
in
man
or
woman
the
airs
of
a
spring
night
in
our
midwestern
country
will
call
it
out
the
planets
shone
benignantly
through
the
leaves
of
maple
and
elm
and
the
young
grass
was
irregular
untouched
as
yet
by
the
mower
as
we
like
it
best
who
love
our
madison
a
moon
hung
in
the
sky
ample
light
for
the
first
of
the
season
that
is
moving
toward
water
babble
to
the
strains
of
guitar
and
banjo
and
boy
and
girl
voices
it
unaccountable
that
there
should
be
so
much
music
in
a
sophomore
or
maybe
that
a
fraternity
affair
sigma
chi
or
delta
tau
or
deke
or
mayhap
those
lads
wear
a
fiji
pin
on
their
waistcoats
i
seem
to
recall
spring
as
an
expression
of
fiji
spirit
in
my
own
days
at
madison
when
i
myself
was
that
particular
blithe
hellenist
with
the
guitar
and
scornful
of
all
barbarians
sylvia
was
a
woman
now
æons
stretched
between
and
that
afternoon
when
she
had
opened
the
door
for
harwood
in
buckeye
lane
his
chivalry
had
been
deeply
touched
by
owen
disclosure
at
the
bank
and
subsequent
reflection
had
not
lightened
the
burden
of
her
confidence
such
obscurities
as
existed
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
first
page
of
sylvia
life
record
were
dark
enough
in
any
circumstances
but
the
darkness
was
intensified
by
her
singular
isolation
the
commission
he
had
accepted
in
her
behalf
from
owen
carried
a
serious
responsibility
these
things
he
pondered
as
they
walked
together
he
felt
the
pathos
of
her
black
gown
but
she
had
rallied
from
the
first
shock
of
her
sorrow
and
met
him
in
his
key
of
badinage
she
was
tall
almost
as
tall
as
he
and
in
the
combined
and
of
the
open
spaces
their
eyes
met
easily
he
was
conscious
of
the
charm
in
sylvia
that
he
had
felt
first
on
the
train
that
day
they
had
sped
through
the
berkshires
together
no
other
girl
had
ever
appealed
to
him
so
strongly
it
was
not
the
charm
of
cleverness
for
she
was
not
clever
in
the
usual
sense
she
said
few
bright
quotable
things
though
her
humor
was
keen
she
had
carried
into
womanhood
the
good
looks
of
her
girlhood
and
she
was
a
person
one
looked
at
twice
her
eyes
were
fine
and
expressive
and
they
faced
the
world
with
an
engaging
candor
they
had
learned
to
laugh
since
we
saw
her
first
college
and
contact
with
the
world
had
done
that
for
her
her
face
was
long
her
nose
a
compromise
of
good
models
her
mouth
a
little
large
but
offering
compensations
when
she
smiled
in
her
quick
responsive
fashion
one
must
go
deeper
harwood
reflected
for
charm
and
it
dawned
upon
him
that
it
was
in
the
girl
self
born
of
an
alert
mind
and
a
kind
and
generous
heart
individuality
personality
were
words
with
which
he
sought
to
characterize
her
and
as
he
struggled
with
terms
he
found
that
she
was
carrying
the
burden
of
the
talk
i
suppose
she
was
saying
in
her
voice
that
was
deeper
than
most
women
voices
and
musical
and
agreeable
to
hear
i
suppose
that
college
is
designed
to
save
us
all
a
lot
of
hard
knocks
i
wonder
if
it
does
if
you
asking
me
personally
i
say
that
there
are
lumps
on
my
brow
where
i
have
bumped
hard
in
spite
of
my
degree
i
disposed
to
think
that
college
only
postpones
the
day
of
our
awakening
we
got
to
shoot
the
chutes
anyhow
it
is
so
written
she
laughed
at
his
way
of
putting
it
oh
you
not
so
much
older
that
you
can
frighten
me
people
on
the
toboggan
always
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
the
percentage
of
those
whose
car
jumps
the
track
is
formidable
just
enough
fatalities
to
flavor
the
statistics
the
seniors
over
there
have
stopped
singing
i
dare
say
they
talking
about
life
in
large
capital
letters
well
there
are
plenty
of
chances
i
rather
of
the
opinion
that
all
here
to
do
something
for
somebody
nobody
life
is
just
his
own
whether
we
want
it
that
way
or
not
we
are
all
links
in
the
chain
and
it
our
business
not
to
be
the
weakest
i
an
individualist
he
said
and
i
very
largely
concerned
in
seeing
what
daniel
harwood
a
poor
young
lawyer
of
mediocre
abilities
can
do
with
this
thing
we
hear
mentioned
as
life
oh
but
there
no
such
thing
as
an
individualist
the
idea
is
purely
academic
and
she
laughed
again
but
less
lightly
we
all
debtors
to
somebody
or
something
to
the
world
itself
for
example
for
the
stars
up
there
for
grass
and
trees
for
the
moon
by
night
and
the
sun
by
day
for
the
gracious
gift
of
friends
a
little
yes
but
they
do
count
so
much
i
owe
my
debt
to
people
real
human
beings
who
may
not
be
as
lucky
as
i
for
a
good
many
thousand
years
people
have
been
at
work
trying
to
cheer
up
the
world
brighten
it
and
make
it
a
better
place
to
live
in
i
owe
all
those
people
something
it
not
merely
a
little
something
it
a
tremendous
lot
and
i
must
pay
these
other
human
beings
who
do
know
what
they
entitled
to
you
have
felt
that
you
have
felt
it
just
as
i
have
i
sure
you
are
still
in
college
and
that
is
what
undergraduates
are
taught
to
call
ideals
miss
garrison
i
hope
you
will
hold
on
to
them
i
had
mine
but
i
conscious
of
late
that
i
losing
my
grip
on
them
inevitable
in
a
man
life
it
a
good
thing
that
women
hold
on
to
them
longer
without
woman
faith
in
such
things
the
world
would
be
a
sad
old
cinder
tumbling
aimlessly
around
in
the
void
she
stopped
abruptly
in
the
path
very
tall
and
slim
in
the
dusk
of
starlight
and
moonlight
he
had
been
carrying
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
he
leaned
on
his
stick
wondering
whether
she
were
really
in
earnest
whether
he
had
displeased
her
by
the
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
please
do
talk
this
old
romantic
mediæval
nonsense
about
women
this
is
the
twentieth
century
and
i
do
believe
for
a
minute
that
a
woman
just
by
being
a
woman
can
keep
the
world
sweet
and
beautiful
once
maybe
but
not
any
more
a
woman
ideals
are
a
bit
better
than
a
man
unless
she
stands
up
for
them
and
works
for
them
you
do
have
to
take
that
from
a
college
senior
you
can
ask
dear
owen
i
suppose
she
knows
life
from
experience
if
any
woman
ever
did
and
she
has
held
to
her
ideals
and
kept
working
away
at
them
but
just
being
a
woman
and
being
good
and
nice
and
going
to
church
and
belonging
to
a
missionary
society
well
mr
harwood
she
had
changed
from
earnestness
to
a
note
of
raillery
yes
miss
garrison
he
replied
in
her
own
key
if
you
expect
me
to
take
issue
with
you
or
owen
on
any
point
you
much
mistaken
you
and
she
are
rather
fortunate
over
many
of
the
rest
of
us
in
having
both
brains
and
gentle
hearts
the
combination
is
irresistible
when
you
come
home
to
throw
in
your
lot
with
that
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
us
in
our
hoosier
capital
i
put
myself
at
your
disposal
i
been
trying
to
figure
some
way
of
saving
the
american
republic
for
the
plain
people
and
i
expect
to
go
out
in
the
campaign
this
fall
and
make
some
speeches
warning
all
good
citizens
to
be
on
guard
against
corporate
greed
invasions
of
sacred
rights
and
so
on
my
way
is
plain
the
duty
clear
he
concluded
with
a
wave
of
his
stick
well
said
sylvia
if
you
care
enough
about
it
to
do
that
you
must
still
have
a
few
ideals
lying
around
somewhere
i
do
know
to
be
honest
about
it
that
it
so
much
my
ideals
as
a
wish
to
help
my
friend
bassett
win
a
fight
i
did
know
that
he
ever
needed
help
in
winning
what
he
really
wanted
to
win
i
have
heard
of
him
only
as
the
indomitable
leader
who
wins
whenever
it
worth
while
well
dan
answered
he
got
a
fight
on
hand
that
he
ca
afford
to
lose
if
he
means
to
stay
in
politics
i
must
learn
all
about
that
when
i
come
home
i
never
saw
bassett
but
once
that
was
at
waupegan
when
i
was
up
there
with
owen
nearly
five
years
ago
he
had
just
come
back
from
the
west
and
spent
only
a
day
at
the
lake
then
you
do
really
know
him
no
they
had
counted
on
having
him
there
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
but
he
came
one
day
and
left
the
next
he
did
even
see
owen
i
remember
that
she
expressed
surprise
that
he
had
come
to
the
lake
and
gone
without
seeing
her
he
a
busy
man
and
works
hard
you
were
getting
acquainted
with
marian
about
that
time
yes
she
was
awfully
good
to
me
that
summer
i
liked
bassett
the
glimpse
i
had
of
him
he
seemed
very
interesting
a
solid
american
character
quiet
and
forceful
yes
he
is
that
he
a
strong
character
he
shown
me
every
kindness
given
me
my
chance
i
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
feel
grateful
to
him
they
had
made
the
complete
circuit
of
the
campus
several
times
and
sylvia
said
it
was
time
to
go
back
the
remembrance
of
bassett
had
turned
her
thoughts
to
marian
and
they
were
still
talking
of
her
when
owen
greeted
them
cheerily
from
the
little
veranda
they
were
to
start
for
boston
in
the
morning
and
harwood
was
to
stay
in
montgomery
a
day
or
two
longer
on
business
connected
with
the
estate
do
let
my
sad
philosophy
keep
you
awake
mr
harwood
i
given
him
all
my
life
programme
owen
i
think
it
has
had
a
depressing
influence
on
him
it
merely
that
you
have
roused
me
to
a
sense
of
my
own
general
worldliness
and
worthlessness
he
replied
laughing
as
they
shook
hands
i
guess
sylvia
can
tell
you
a
good
many
things
daniel
said
owen
i
wish
you
call
myers
he
my
seymour
farmer
on
the
long
distance
in
the
morning
and
tell
him
not
to
think
i
wo
be
down
to
look
at
his
corn
when
i
get
back
tell
him
i
gone
to
college
but
i
be
right
down
there
when
i
get
home
chapter

world
harwood
reached
the
capital
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
after
owen
and
sylvia
had
gone
east
and
went
at
once
to
the
boordman
building
miss
farrell
was
folding
and
sealing
letters
bearing
signature
hello
little
stranger
i
begun
to
think
you
had
met
with
foul
play
as
the
hero
says
in
scene
two
act
three
of
dark
all
week
at
the
park
theatre
at
prices
within
the
reach
of
all
business
has
been
good
if
you
press
me
for
news
but
that
has
had
much
attention
since
you
departed
this
life
everybody
saying
look
listen
when
in
doubt
you
say
that
the
white
aprons
in
the
lunch
rooms
say
it
now
when
you
kick
on
the
size
of
the
buns
you
will
find
your
letters
in
the
drawer
i
told
that
collector
from
the
necktie
foundry
that
he
need
wear
himself
to
a
shadow
carrying
bills
up
here
that
you
paid
all
your
bills
by
check
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
as
that
was
the
you
better
frame
some
new
to
avoid
other
breaks
like
that
i
ca
do
much
lying
at
my
present
salary
she
stood
with
her
hands
clasping
her
belt
and
continued
to
enlighten
him
on
current
history
as
he
looked
over
his
letters
that
young
allen
thatcher
has
been
making
life
a
burden
to
me
in
your
lamented
absence
wanted
to
know
every
few
hours
if
you
had
come
back
and
threatened
to
call
you
up
on
the
long
distance
at
montgomery
but
i
told
him
you
were
trying
a
murder
case
over
there
and
that
if
he
want
to
get
nailed
for
contempt
of
court
he
better
not
interrupt
the
proceedings
you
speaking
of
allen
thatcher
are
you
miss
farrell
asked
harwood
in
the
tone
to
which
the
girl
frequently
drove
him
the
same
like
the
mind
reader
you
are
say
that
boy
is
stuck
on
you
or
anything
he
came
up
here
yesterday
afternoon
when
the
boss
was
out
and
wanted
to
talk
things
over
he
seemed
to
think
i
had
anything
to
do
but
be
a
sister
to
him
and
hear
his
troubles
well
i
got
embarrassments
of
my
own
with
that
true
sport
his
papa
sending
me
an
offer
of
a
hundred
per
month
to
work
for
him
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
in
advance
this
harwood
is
private
and
confidential
i
guess
i
have
worked
at
the
state
house
without
learning
a
few
tricks
in
this
mortal
vale
of
politics
she
had
calculated
nicely
the
effect
of
this
shot
harwood
might
treat
her
as
she
said
like
a
with
a
harelip
but
occasionally
she
made
him
sit
up
he
sat
up
now
he
remarked
with
the
diplomatic
unconcern
that
it
was
best
to
employ
with
her
refused
the
offer
did
you
miss
farrell
i
certainly
did
as
between
a
fat
old
sport
like
ed
thatcher
and
a
gentleman
like
bassett
money
does
count
not
even
with
a
or
poor
working
girl
like
me
hush
are
we
quite
alone
she
bent
toward
the
door
dramatically
what
he
was
playing
for
as
neat
as
a
hatpin
in
your
loved
one
eye
was
some
facts
about
the
committee
work
in
that
last
session
i
worked
at
the
state
house
cute
of
thatcher
well
not
so
awful
bright
he
does
know
what
he
up
against
if
he
thinks
mort
bassett
can
be
caught
on
flypaper
and
you
can
be
dead
sure
i
not
going
to
sprinkle
the
sugar
to
catch
our
boss
with
all
that
transportation
committee
business
was
just
as
straight
as
the
way
home
but
miss
farrell
tapped
her
mouth
daintily
with
her
fingers
to
stifle
an
imaginary
yawn
but
little
rose
brought
down
her
shorthand
notebooks
marked
personal
and
the
boss
and
i
burned
them
yesterday
morning
early
right
there
in
that
grate
in
his
room
what
i
think
of
ed
thatcher
a
pearl
necklace
for
my
birthday
ought
to
be
about
right
for
that
harwood
had
been
drinking
this
in
as
he
opened
and
sorted
his
letters
he
paused
and
stared
at
her
absently
you
referred
to
a
caller
a
moment
ago
the
gentleman
who
annoyed
you
so
much
on
the
telephone
was
i
to
call
him
or
anything
like
that
he
left
a
good
many
orders
but
i
think
you
were
to
eat
food
with
him
in
the
frosty
halls
of
the
university
club
almost
at
once
he
in
a
state
of
mind
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
his
father
enemy
just
like
a
park
theatre
thriller
wants
you
to
tell
him
what
to
do
and
you
will
pardon
me
for
suggesting
that
if
there
to
be
an
elopement
you
write
it
up
yourself
for
the
i
was
talking
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
on
the
desk
at
the
whitcomb
and
she
says
the
business
in
that
tavern
is
painful
to
handle
hot
words
flying
over
the
state
about
this
rumpus
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
the
fight
is
warm
and
i
guess
somebody
will
know
more
after
the
convention
but
say
um
said
harwood
whose
gaze
was
upon
the
frame
of
a
new
building
that
was
rising
across
the
street
he
was
thinking
of
allen
if
marian
and
allen
were
subjects
of
gossip
in
connection
with
the
break
between
their
fathers
he
foresaw
trouble
and
he
was
sorry
for
he
was
sincerely
devoted
to
the
boy
and
marian
he
liked
also
in
spite
of
her
vagaries
a
great
many
people
were
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
personal
difficulties
of
thatcher
and
bassett
even
quiet
montgomery
was
teeming
and
on
the
way
from
the
station
he
had
met
half
a
dozen
acquaintances
who
had
paused
to
shake
hands
and
say
something
about
the
political
situation
his
ignorance
of
bassett
real
intentions
which
presumably
the
defiance
of
the
courier
merely
cloaked
was
not
without
its
embarrassment
he
had
been
known
as
a
bassett
man
he
had
received
and
talked
to
innumerable
politicians
of
bassett
party
in
the
boordman
building
and
during
the
four
years
of
his
identification
with
bassett
he
had
visited
most
of
the
county
seats
on
political
and
business
errands
the
closeness
of
their
association
made
all
the
more
surprising
this
sudden
exclusion
i
said
repeated
miss
farrell
lightly
touching
the
smooth
cliff
of
yellow
hair
above
her
brow
with
the
back
of
her
hand
i
was
about
to
give
you
a
message
from
his
majesty
our
king
but
if
you
on
a
pipe
dream
do
let
me
call
you
home
oh
yes
pardon
me
what
were
you
about
to
say
bassett
said
that
if
you
came
in
before
i
quit
to
ask
you
to
come
over
to
the
whitcomb
bassett
blew
in
from
that
sanatorium
in
connecticut
where
they
been
working
on
her
nerves
miss
marian
brought
her
back
and
they
stopped
in
town
to
rest
and
say
here
miss
farrell
lowered
her
voice
the
missis
must
try
his
soul
a
good
deal
i
wonder
how
he
ever
picked
out
of
the
bunch
that
will
do
said
harwood
sharply
i
find
bassett
at
the
whitcomb
and
i
sha
have
anything
for
you
there
had
been
a
meeting
of
the
central
committee
preliminary
to
the
approaching
state
convention
a
number
of
candidates
had
already
opened
headquarters
at
the
whitcomb
members
of
congress
aspirants
for
the
governor
seat
to
be
filled
two
years
hence
and
petty
satraps
from
far
and
near
were
visible
at
the
hotel
if
bassett
star
was
declining
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
it
in
the
conduct
of
the
advance
guard
if
any
change
was
apparent
it
pointed
to
an
increase
of
personal
popularity
bassett
was
not
greatly
given
to
loafing
in
public
places
he
usually
received
visitors
at
such
times
in
an
upper
room
of
the
hotel
but
harwood
found
him
established
on
a
settee
in
the
lobby
in
plain
view
of
all
seekers
and
from
the
fixed
appearance
of
the
men
clustered
about
him
he
had
held
this
position
for
some
time
harwood
drew
into
the
outer
edge
of
the
crowd
unnoticed
for
a
moment
bassett
was
at
his
usual
ease
a
little
cheerfuler
of
countenance
than
was
his
wont
and
yet
not
unduly
anxious
to
appear
tranquil
he
had
precipitated
one
of
the
most
interesting
political
struggles
the
state
had
ever
witnessed
but
his
air
of
unconcern
before
this
mixed
company
of
his
fellow
partisans
among
whom
there
were
friends
and
foes
was
well
calculated
to
inspire
faith
in
his
leadership
some
one
was
telling
a
story
and
at
its
conclusion
bassett
caught
harwood
eye
and
called
to
him
in
a
manner
that
at
once
drew
attention
to
the
young
man
hello
dan
you
back
from
the
country
all
right
i
see
i
guess
you
boys
all
know
harwood
you
seen
his
name
in
the
newspapers
several
of
the
loungers
shook
hands
with
harwood
who
had
cultivated
the
handshaking
habit
and
he
made
a
point
of
addressing
to
each
one
some
personal
remark
thus
the
gentleman
from
tippecanoe
who
had
met
dan
at
the
congressional
convention
in
lafayette
two
years
earlier
felt
that
he
must
have
favorably
impressed
bassett
agent
on
that
occasion
else
how
had
harwood
asked
at
once
with
the
most
shameless
flattery
whether
they
still
had
the
same
brand
of
fried
chicken
at
his
house
and
the
gentleman
from
the
remote
shores
of
the
lake
a
rare
visitor
in
town
had
every
right
to
believe
from
dan
reference
to
the
loss
by
fire
of
the
gentleman
house
a
year
earlier
that
that
calamity
had
aroused
in
dan
the
deepest
sympathy
dan
had
mastered
these
tricks
it
rather
tickled
his
sense
of
humor
to
practice
them
but
it
must
be
said
for
him
that
he
was
sincerely
interested
in
people
particularly
in
these
men
who
played
the
great
game
if
he
ever
achieved
anything
in
politics
it
must
be
through
just
such
material
as
offered
itself
on
such
occasions
as
this
in
the
halls
of
the
whitcomb
these
men
might
be
tearing
the
leader
to
pieces
or
the
day
after
but
he
was
still
in
the
saddle
and
not
knowing
but
that
young
harwood
might
be
of
use
to
them
some
day
they
greeted
him
as
one
of
the
inner
circle
most
of
these
men
sincerely
liked
and
admired
bassett
and
many
of
them
accepted
the
prevailing
superstition
as
to
his
omniscience
and
invulnerability
even
in
the
republican
camp
many
shared
the
belief
that
the
spears
of
the
righteous
were
of
no
avail
against
him
dan
loyalty
to
bassett
had
never
been
more
firmly
planted
bassett
had
always
preserved
a
certain
formality
in
his
relations
with
him
he
was
calling
him
dan
naturally
and
as
though
unconscious
of
the
transition
this
was
not
without
its
effect
on
harwood
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
agreeable
it
was
to
be
thus
familiarly
addressed
by
the
leader
in
such
a
gathering
bassett
suggested
that
he
speak
to
bassett
and
marian
who
were
spending
a
few
days
in
town
and
he
found
them
in
the
hotel
parlor
where
bassett
joined
them
shortly
bassett
and
dan
had
always
got
on
well
together
his
nearness
to
her
husband
brought
him
close
to
the
domestic
circle
and
he
had
been
invariably
responsive
to
her
demands
upon
his
time
dan
had
learned
inevitably
a
good
deal
of
the
inner
life
of
the
bassetts
and
now
and
then
he
had
been
aware
that
bassett
was
sounding
him
discreetly
as
to
her
husband
plans
and
projects
but
these
approaches
had
been
managed
with
the
nicest
tact
and
discretion
in
her
long
absences
from
home
she
had
lost
touch
with
political
interests
and
occupations
but
she
knew
of
his
break
with
thatcher
she
prided
herself
on
being
a
woman
of
the
world
and
while
she
had
flinched
sometimes
at
the
attacks
made
upon
her
husband
she
was
nevertheless
proud
of
his
influence
in
affairs
bassett
had
once
at
a
time
when
he
was
being
assailed
for
smothering
some
measure
in
the
senate
given
her
a
number
of
books
bearing
upon
the
struggle
in
which
she
read
that
the
prominent
leaders
in
that
movement
had
suffered
the
most
unjust
attacks
and
while
it
was
not
quite
clear
wherein
lay
bassett
likeness
to
lincoln
lovejoy
and
wendell
phillips
she
had
been
persuaded
that
the
most
honorable
men
in
public
life
are
often
the
targets
of
scandal
her
early
years
in
washington
with
her
father
had
impressed
her
imagination
the
dream
of
returning
there
as
the
wife
of
a
senator
danced
brightly
in
her
horizons
it
would
mean
much
to
marian
and
blackford
if
their
father
like
their
grandfather
singleton
should
attain
a
seat
in
the
senate
and
she
was
aware
that
without
such
party
service
as
bassett
was
rendering
with
its
resulting
antagonisms
the
virulent
newspaper
attacks
the
social
estrangements
that
she
had
not
escaped
in
fraserville
a
man
could
not
hope
for
party
preferment
bassett
had
recently
visited
blackford
at
the
military
school
where
his
son
was
established
and
talk
fell
upon
the
boy
black
likes
to
have
a
good
time
but
he
will
come
out
all
right
the
curriculum
does
altogether
fit
him
that
his
only
trouble
bassett
glanced
at
harwood
for
approval
and
dan
promptly
supported
the
father
position
blackford
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
been
threatened
with
expulsion
lately
for
insubordination
bassett
had
confessed
to
dan
several
times
his
anxiety
touching
the
boy
when
the
mother
had
just
returned
after
a
long
sojourn
in
a
rest
cure
was
not
a
fit
occasion
for
discussing
such
matters
what
allen
doing
asked
marian
i
suppose
now
that
papa
is
having
a
rumpus
with
thatcher
i
shall
never
see
him
any
more
you
should
speak
so
marian
a
hotel
parlor
is
no
place
to
discuss
your
father
affairs
admonished
bassett
oh
allen
ever
so
much
fun
he
a
socialist
or
something
aunt
sally
likes
him
ever
so
much
aunt
sally
likes
thatcher
too
for
that
matter
she
concluded
boldly
thatcher
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
bassett
soberly
you
can
be
awfully
funny
when
you
want
to
papa
replied
marian
as
we
came
through
pittsburg
this
morning
i
bought
a
paper
that
told
about
look
listen
but
allen
wo
mind
if
you
do
whistle
to
his
father
to
keep
off
the
track
thatcher
name
was
never
mentioned
by
me
in
any
such
connection
replied
bassett
but
he
laughed
when
marian
leaned
over
and
patted
his
cheek
to
express
her
satisfaction
in
her
father
cleverness
i
think
it
unfortunate
that
you
have
gone
to
war
with
that
man
remarked
bassett
wearily
you
dignify
it
too
much
by
calling
it
a
war
harwood
interjected
we
do
want
such
men
in
politics
in
this
state
and
somebody
has
to
deal
with
them
i
guess
it
will
be
a
lively
scrap
all
right
enough
said
marian
delighted
at
the
prospect
we
going
to
move
to
the
city
this
fall
harwood
has
papa
told
you
bassett
glanced
at
her
husband
with
alert
suspicion
thinking
that
perhaps
in
her
absence
he
had
been
conniving
to
this
end
with
marian
bassett
smiled
at
his
daughter
adroitness
in
taking
advantage
of
harwood
presence
to
introduce
this
subject
it
had
been
the
paramount
issue
with
her
for
several
years
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
stay
at
fraserville
the
rest
of
my
days
if
i
get
through
another
waupegan
summer
safely
said
bassett
the
mere
thought
of
moving
is
horrible
oh
we
would
exactly
move
in
coming
here
we
have
an
apartment
in
one
of
these
comfortable
new
houses
and
come
down
while
the
legislature
in
session
so
we
can
be
with
papa
and
there
ever
so
much
music
here
now
and
the
theatres
and
i
could
have
a
party
here
you
know
i
never
had
one
papa
and
it
would
be
nice
to
be
near
aunt
sally
she
getting
old
and
needs
us
yes
she
undoubtedly
does
said
bassett
with
faint
irony
her
daughter
rapid
fire
of
suggestions
wearied
bassett
she
turned
to
harwood
bassett
and
marian
have
been
telling
me
harwood
that
aunt
sally
went
back
to
college
with
sylvia
garrison
after
professor
death
poor
girl
it
quite
like
aunt
sally
to
do
that
sylvia
must
be
very
forlorn
with
all
her
people
gone
i
think
aunt
sally
knew
her
mother
i
hope
the
girl
is
wholly
destitute
no
the
professor
left
a
small
estate
and
miss
garrison
expects
to
teach
dan
answered
dan
is
the
administrator
remarked
bassett
i
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
miss
garrison
affairs
are
in
good
hands
hallie
aunt
sally
is
very
fond
of
you
harwood
i
hope
you
appreciate
that
said
mrs
bassett
aunt
sally
does
like
everybody
aunt
sally
a
brick
all
right
declared
marian
as
an
accompaniment
to
dan
expression
of
his
gratification
that
owen
had
honored
him
with
her
friendship
it
too
bad
the
girl
will
have
to
teach
said
bassett
it
must
be
a
dog
life
i
think
miss
garrison
does
look
at
it
that
way
harwood
intervened
she
thinks
she
in
the
world
to
do
something
for
somebody
she
a
very
interesting
a
very
charming
young
woman
well
i
have
seen
her
in
five
years
she
was
only
a
young
girl
that
summer
at
the
lake
how
soon
will
aunt
sally
be
back
i
do
hope
coming
to
waupegan
if
i
known
she
was
going
to
wellesley
we
could
have
waited
for
her
in
new
york
and
marian
and
i
could
have
gone
with
them
to
see
sylvia
graduated
i
always
wanted
to
visit
the
college
it
was
better
for
you
to
come
home
hallie
said
bassett
you
are
not
quite
up
to
yet
and
now
he
added
dan
and
i
have
some
business
on
hand
for
an
hour
or
so
and
i
going
to
send
you
and
marian
for
an
automobile
ride
before
dinner
you
must
quit
the
moment
you
are
tired
wish
we
could
all
go
but
i
have
seen
dan
much
lately
and
as
i
going
home
with
you
we
sha
have
another
chance
when
his
wife
and
daughter
had
been
dispatched
in
the
motor
bassett
suggested
that
they
go
to
a
private
room
he
had
engaged
in
the
hotel
first
giving
orders
at
the
office
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
did
not
however
escape
at
once
from
men
who
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
him
in
the
lobby
and
corridors
but
he
made
short
work
of
them
i
want
to
thresh
out
some
things
with
you
and
i
be
as
brief
as
possible
said
bassett
when
he
and
harwood
were
alone
you
got
matters
fixed
satisfactorily
at
montgomery
no
trouble
about
your
appointment
none
owen
had
arranged
all
that
you
mentioned
to
her
did
you
my
offer
to
help
oh
yes
but
she
had
already
arranged
with
akins
the
banker
about
the
administrator
bond
and
we
went
at
once
to
business
that
all
right
only
i
wanted
to
be
sure
owen
understood
i
had
offered
to
help
you
she
very
kind
to
my
wife
and
children
bassett
has
been
almost
like
a
daughter
to
her
you
know
there
really
some
property
to
administer
is
there
very
little
sir
the
professor
had
been
obliged
to
drop
part
of
his
life
insurance
and
there
was
only
two
thousand
in
force
when
he
died
the
house
he
lived
in
may
bring
another
two
there
are
some
contracts
that
seem
to
have
no
value
and
the
old
gentleman
had
invested
what
was
a
large
sum
for
him
in
white
river
canneries
bassett
frowned
and
he
asked
quickly
how
much
five
thousand
dollars
as
much
as
that
bassett
connection
with
white
river
canneries
was
an
incident
of
the
politician
career
to
which
harwood
had
never
been
wholly
reconciled
nor
was
he
pleasantly
impressed
by
bassett
next
remark
which
in
view
of
bassett
natural
expectations
and
these
dan
had
frequently
heard
mentioned
at
the
capital
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
leading
question
that
unfortunate
but
i
suppose
owen
by
reason
of
her
friendship
for
the
grandfather
wo
let
the
girl
suffer
she
not
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
be
dependent
in
any
case
she
holds
rather
altruistic
ideas
in
fact
remarked
harwood
i
mean
he
added
seeing
that
bassett
waited
for
him
to
explain
himself
that
miss
garrison
feels
that
she
starts
life
in
debt
to
the
world
by
reason
of
her
own
opportunities
and
so
on
she
expects
to
make
payments
on
that
debt
in
debt
bassett
repeated
vacantly
oh
not
literally
i
see
she
expects
to
teach
and
help
others
in
that
way
that
commendable
but
let
me
see
he
had
taken
an
unsharpened
lead
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
was
slipping
it
through
his
fingers
absently
allowing
its
blunt
ends
to
tap
the
arm
of
his
chair
at
intervals
after
a
moment
silence
he
plunged
into
his
own
affairs
you
probably
saw
my
tip
to
thatcher
in
the
i
guess
everybody
has
seen
it
by
this
time
he
added
grimly
and
he
went
on
as
though
making
a
statement
his
mind
had
thoroughly
rehearsed
thatcher
and
i
have
been
pretty
thick
we
been
in
a
good
many
business
deals
together
we
been
useful
to
each
other
he
had
more
money
than
i
had
to
begin
with
but
i
had
other
resources
influence
and
so
on
that
he
needed
i
guess
we
quits
on
the
business
side
you
may
be
interested
to
know
that
i
never
had
a
cent
of
money
in
his
breweries
and
distilleries
but
i
helped
protect
the
traffic
in
return
for
support
he
has
given
some
of
my
own
enterprises
i
never
owned
a
penny
in
that
fraserville
brewery
for
instance
but
i
been
pointed
out
as
its
owner
they
got
the
idea
here
in
indiana
that
saloons
are
my
chief
joy
in
life
but
nothing
is
farther
from
the
truth
when
bassett
has
been
troubled
about
that
i
have
always
been
able
to
tell
her
with
a
good
conscience
that
i
had
a
penny
in
the
business
i
frankly
antagonized
legislation
directed
against
the
saloon
for
i
never
taken
any
stock
in
this
clamor
of
the
prohibitionists
and
temperance
cranks
generally
but
i
stood
consistently
for
a
proper
control
thatcher
and
i
got
along
all
right
until
he
saw
that
the
party
was
coming
into
power
again
and
got
the
senatorial
bee
in
his
bonnet
got
the
idea
that
he
can
buy
his
way
in
and
to
buy
a
seat
he
got
to
buy
my
friends
that
a
clear
proposition
is
it
yes
sir
i
have
seen
that
he
had
any
personal
influence
worth
counting
exactly
now
i
do
intend
that
ed
thatcher
shall
buy
a
seat
in
the
united
states
senate
if
our
party
in
indiana
has
one
to
dispose
of
not
so
good
myself
but
when
i
found
that
thatcher
had
begun
to
build
up
a
little
machine
for
himself
i
resolved
to
show
him
that
i
ca
be
used
by
any
man
so
long
as
he
thinks
he
needs
me
and
then
kicked
out
when
i
in
the
way
and
i
got
some
state
pride
too
and
with
all
the
scandals
going
around
in
other
states
over
the
sale
of
seats
at
washington
i
not
going
to
have
my
party
in
the
state
where
i
was
born
and
where
i
have
lived
all
my
life
lend
itself
to
the
ambitions
of
an
ed
thatcher
i
think
you
share
that
feeling
the
people
of
the
whole
state
will
commend
that
replied
dan
warmly
and
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
senate
i
do
want
anything
from
my
party
that
it
does
want
me
to
have
interrupted
bassett
he
rose
and
paced
the
floor
an
unusual
color
had
come
into
his
face
but
otherwise
he
betrayed
no
agitation
he
crossed
from
the
door
to
the
window
and
resumed
his
seat
they
said
of
me
that
i
fight
in
the
dark
that
i
a
man
of
secret
and
malign
methods
the
said
only
this
morning
that
i
have
no
courage
that
i
never
make
an
attack
where
it
costs
me
anything
already
proved
that
to
be
a
lie
my
attack
on
thatcher
is
likely
to
cost
me
a
good
deal
you
may
be
sure
he
wo
scruple
to
make
the
bill
as
heavy
as
he
can
i
talking
to
you
freely
and
i
say
to
you
that
i
expect
the
better
element
of
the
party
to
rally
to
my
support
you
see
i
going
to
give
you
idealists
a
chance
to
do
something
that
will
count
thatcher
is
not
a
foe
to
be
despised
here
his
reply
to
my
look
listen
editorial
the
sheriff
served
it
on
me
just
as
i
stepped
into
the
elevator
to
come
up
here
the
paper
harwood
took
wonderingly
was
a
writ
citing
bassett
to
appear
as
defendant
in
a
suit
brought
in
the
circuit
court
by
edward
thatcher
against
the
courier
publishing
company
morton
bassett
and
sarah
owen
bassett
stretched
himself
at
ease
in
his
chair
and
explained
i
wanted
a
newspaper
and
he
was
indifferent
about
it
at
the
time
but
we
went
in
together
and
he
consented
that
i
should
have
a
controlling
interest
as
i
was
tied
up
tight
right
then
i
had
to
get
owen
to
help
me
out
it
was
the
kind
of
deal
you
want
to
hawk
about
town
and
neither
thatcher
nor
i
cared
to
have
it
known
for
a
while
that
we
had
bought
the
paper
but
it
hardly
a
secret
now
of
course
owen
and
i
together
own
one
hundred
and
shares
of
the
total
of
three
hundred
thatcher
owns
the
rest
and
he
was
satisfied
to
let
it
go
that
way
he
signed
an
agreement
that
i
should
manage
the
paper
and
said
he
did
want
anything
but
dividends
owen
interest
is
subject
to
your
wishes
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
well
i
guaranteed
eight
per
cent
on
her
investment
but
we
made
it
lately
easily
i
now
got
to
devise
some
means
of
getting
rid
of
thatcher
but
we
let
him
cool
till
after
the
convention
owen
wo
be
back
for
several
weeks
i
suppose
no
she
and
miss
garrison
will
return
immediately
after
the
commencement
exercises
well
thatcher
brought
that
suit
thinking
that
if
he
could
throw
the
paper
into
a
receivership
he
run
up
the
price
when
it
came
to
be
sold
and
shake
me
out
he
knew
too
that
it
would
annoy
owen
to
be
involved
in
litigation
it
surprising
that
he
would
incur
her
wrath
himself
she
always
been
mighty
decent
to
ed
and
kind
to
his
boy
but
i
have
to
buy
her
stock
and
let
her
out
it
a
delicate
business
and
for
bassett
sake
i
got
to
get
her
aunt
out
as
quickly
as
possible
that
of
course
will
be
easily
managed
it
too
bad
she
away
just
now
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
asked
her
help
in
any
of
my
business
affairs
and
it
unfortunate
the
fact
is
that
bassett
know
of
it
he
rose
and
crossed
the
room
slowly
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
but
if
owen
is
guaranteed
against
loss
there
no
ground
for
criticizing
you
said
dan
there
nothing
to
trouble
about
on
that
side
of
it
i
should
think
oh
i
not
troubling
about
that
replied
bassett
shortly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
to
the
window
gazing
out
on
the
street
in
silence
for
several
minutes
then
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
told
you
dan
when
you
opened
our
office
in
the
boordman
building
that
if
ever
the
time
came
when
you
did
want
to
serve
me
any
longer
you
were
to
feel
free
to
quit
you
are
under
no
obligations
to
me
of
any
sort
i
caught
a
bargain
in
you
you
have
been
useful
to
me
in
many
ways
you
have
carried
nearly
the
whole
burden
of
the
receivership
in
a
way
to
win
me
the
praise
of
the
court
and
all
others
interested
if
you
should
quit
me
i
should
still
be
your
debtor
i
had
about
decided
to
leave
you
out
of
my
calculations
in
politics
you
have
the
making
of
a
good
lawyer
and
if
you
opened
an
office
you
would
find
clients
without
trouble
you
are
beginning
to
be
known
very
well
known
for
a
man
of
your
years
harwood
demurred
feebly
unheeded
by
bassett
who
continued
steadily
i
had
thought
for
a
time
that
i
should
encourage
you
to
take
any
part
in
politics
at
least
in
my
affairs
the
receivership
has
been
giving
you
enough
to
do
and
the
game
after
all
is
a
hard
one
even
after
i
decided
to
break
with
thatcher
i
thought
i
leave
you
out
of
it
that
why
i
gave
you
no
intimation
of
what
was
coming
but
put
the
details
into
atwill
hands
i
had
really
meant
to
show
you
a
proof
of
that
editorial
but
i
was
sure
until
they
had
to
close
the
page
that
night
that
i
was
ready
to
make
the
break
i
had
been
pretty
hot
that
evening
at
the
country
club
when
i
saw
pettit
and
thatcher
chumming
together
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
cooled
off
but
i
find
that
i
got
in
the
habit
of
relying
on
you
i
been
open
with
you
from
the
beginning
and
as
you
know
i
not
much
given
to
taking
men
into
my
confidence
but
i
been
leaning
on
you
a
good
deal
more
in
fact
than
i
realized
there
was
no
questioning
bassett
sincerity
nor
was
there
any
doubt
that
this
appeal
was
having
its
effect
on
the
younger
man
if
bassett
had
been
a
weakling
timorously
making
overtures
for
help
harwood
would
have
been
sensible
of
it
but
a
man
of
demonstrated
force
and
intelligence
who
had
probably
never
talked
thus
to
another
soul
in
his
life
was
addressing
him
with
a
candor
at
once
disarming
and
compelling
it
was
not
easy
to
say
to
a
man
from
whom
he
had
accepted
every
kindness
that
he
had
ceased
to
trust
him
that
while
he
had
been
his
willing
companion
on
voyages
he
would
desert
without
a
qualm
before
the
tempest
but
even
now
bassett
had
asked
nothing
of
him
why
should
he
harden
his
heart
against
the
man
who
had
been
his
friend
you
have
your
ideals
fine
ideas
of
public
service
that
i
admire
our
party
needs
such
men
as
you
the
young
fellows
could
get
away
from
us
fast
enough
after
many
of
the
sons
of
democrats
joined
the
republicans
fitch
has
spoken
to
me
of
you
often
as
the
kind
of
man
we
ought
to
push
forward
and
i
willing
to
put
you
out
on
the
where
you
can
work
for
your
ideals
my
help
will
handicap
you
at
first
his
voice
grew
dry
and
hard
here
but
once
you
have
got
a
start
you
can
shake
me
off
as
quick
as
you
like
it
a
perfectly
selfish
proposition
i
making
harwood
it
simply
gets
down
to
this
that
i
need
your
help
of
course
bassett
if
i
can
serve
you
in
any
way
anything
you
can
do
for
me
you
may
do
if
you
do
feel
that
you
will
be
debasing
yourself
in
fighting
under
my
flag
it
a
black
flag
they
say
just
as
black
as
thatcher
i
do
believe
you
want
to
join
thatcher
the
question
is
do
you
want
to
stick
to
me
bassett
had
spoken
quietly
throughout
he
had
made
no
effort
to
play
upon
harwood
sympathies
or
to
appeal
to
his
gratitude
he
was
in
common
phrase
to
be
taken
or
let
alone
harwood
realized
that
he
must
either
decline
outright
or
declare
his
fealty
in
a
word
it
was
in
no
view
a
debatable
matter
he
could
not
suggest
points
of
difference
or
even
inquire
as
to
the
nature
of
the
service
to
be
exacted
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
man
who
he
had
felt
that
night
of
their
first
meeting
at
fraserville
gave
and
received
hard
blows
yet
he
did
not
doubt
that
if
their
relations
terminated
bassett
would
deal
with
him
magnanimously
he
realized
that
after
all
it
was
not
bassett
who
was
on
trial
it
was
daniel
harwood
he
saw
his
life
in
sharp
fulgurations
the
farm
cleared
of
debt
through
bassett
generosity
to
be
sure
where
his
father
and
brothers
struggled
to
wrest
a
livelihood
from
reluctant
soil
and
their
pride
and
hope
in
him
he
saw
his
teachers
at
college
men
who
had
pointed
the
way
to
useful
and
honorable
lives
and
more
than
all
sumner
rose
before
him
sumner
who
had
impressed
him
more
than
any
other
man
he
had
ever
known
sumner
visage
was
etched
grimly
in
his
consciousness
verily
sumner
would
not
have
dallied
with
a
man
of
bassett
ilk
he
had
believed
when
he
left
college
that
sumner
teaching
and
example
would
be
a
buckler
and
shield
to
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
here
he
was
faltering
before
a
man
to
whom
the
great
teacher
would
have
given
scarce
a
moment
contemptuous
thought
he
could
even
hear
the
professor
voice
as
he
ironically
pronounced
upon
sordid
little
despots
of
bassett
stamp
and
only
hours
earlier
he
had
been
talking
to
a
girl
on
the
campus
at
madison
who
had
spoken
of
idealism
and
service
in
the
terms
of
which
he
had
thought
of
those
things
when
he
left
college
even
allen
thatcher
in
his
whimsical
fashion
stood
for
ideals
and
dreamed
of
the
heroic
men
who
had
labored
steadfastly
for
great
causes
here
was
his
chance
now
to
rid
himself
of
bassett
to
breathe
free
air
again
on
the
other
hand
bassett
had
himself
suggested
that
harwood
once
in
a
position
to
command
attention
might
go
his
own
gait
his
servitude
would
be
for
a
day
only
and
by
it
he
should
win
eternal
freedom
he
caught
eagerly
at
what
bassett
was
saying
grateful
that
the
moment
of
his
choice
was
delayed
the
state
convention
is
only
three
weeks
off
and
i
had
pretty
carefully
mapped
it
out
before
the
dropped
that
shot
across
bows
i
arranged
for
you
to
go
as
delegate
to
the
state
convention
from
this
county
and
to
have
a
place
on
the
committee
on
resolutions
this
will
give
you
an
introduction
to
the
party
that
will
be
of
value
they
will
say
you
are
my
man
but
they
said
that
of
other
men
who
have
lived
it
down
i
want
thatcher
to
have
his
way
in
that
convention
naming
the
ticket
as
far
as
he
pleases
and
appearing
to
give
me
a
drubbing
the
party
going
to
be
defeated
in
november
there
no
ducking
that
we
let
thatcher
get
the
odium
of
that
defeat
about
the
next
time
we
go
in
and
win
and
there
wo
be
any
more
thatcher
nonsense
this
is
politics
you
understand
harwood
nodded
but
bassett
had
not
finished
it
clearly
was
not
his
purpose
to
stand
the
young
man
in
a
corner
and
demand
a
choice
from
him
bassett
pursued
negotiations
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
thatcher
thinks
he
has
scored
heavily
on
me
by
sneaking
into
fraserville
and
kidnaping
old
ike
pettit
that
fellow
has
always
been
a
nuisance
to
me
i
carried
a
mortgage
on
his
newspaper
for
ten
years
but
thatcher
has
mercifully
taken
that
burden
off
my
shoulders
by
paying
it
thatcher
can
print
anything
he
wants
to
about
me
in
my
own
town
but
it
will
cost
him
some
money
those
people
up
there
do
think
i
so
wicked
and
the
county
democrat
wo
have
any
advertisements
for
a
while
but
fake
medical
ads
but
ike
will
have
more
room
for
the
exploitation
of
his
own
peculiar
brand
of
homely
hoosier
humor
bassett
smiled
and
harwood
was
relieved
to
be
able
to
laugh
aloud
he
was
enjoying
this
glimpse
of
the
inner
mysteries
of
the
great
game
his
disdain
of
thatcher
clumsy
attempts
to
circumvent
bassett
was
complete
in
any
view
bassett
was
preferable
to
thatcher
as
the
senator
from
fraser
had
said
there
was
really
nothing
worse
than
thatcher
with
his
breweries
and
his
sordidness
and
vulgarity
thatcher
efforts
to
practice
bassett
methods
with
bassett
own
tools
was
a
subject
for
laughter
it
seemed
for
the
moment
that
harwood
decision
might
be
struck
on
this
note
of
mirth
dan
wondered
whether
in
permitting
bassett
thus
to
disclose
his
plans
and
purposes
he
had
not
already
nailed
his
flag
to
the
bassett
masthead
i
do
want
these
fellows
who
are
in
state
conventions
particularly
those
known
to
be
my
old
friends
to
figure
much
bassett
continued
i
asking
your
aid
because
you
new
and
the
meanest
thing
they
can
say
against
you
is
that
in
my
camp
they
tell
me
you
an
effective
speaker
a
number
of
county
chairmen
have
said
your
speeches
in
the
last
campaign
made
a
good
impression
i
shall
want
you
to
prepare
a
speech
about
four
minutes
long
and
vigorous
we
decide
later
what
that
speech
shall
be
about
i
got
it
in
mind
to
spring
something
in
that
convention
just
to
show
thatcher
that
there
are
turns
of
the
game
he
does
know
yet
i
going
to
give
you
a
part
that
will
make
remember
you
for
some
time
dan
bassett
smile
showed
his
strong
sound
teeth
he
rarely
laughed
but
he
yielded
now
to
the
contagion
of
the
humor
he
had
aroused
in
harwood
it
a
big
chance
you
giving
me
to
get
into
things
replied
harwood
i
do
my
best
then
he
added
in
the
glow
of
his
complete
surrender
you
never
asked
me
to
do
a
dishonorable
thing
in
the
four
years
i
been
with
you
there
nothing
i
ought
to
be
glad
to
do
from
any
standpoint
and
i
grateful
for
this
new
mark
of
your
confidence
that
all
right
dan
there
are
things
in
store
for
young
men
in
politics
in
this
state
republicans
and
democrats
said
bassett
without
elation
or
any
show
of
feeling
whatever
once
the
limelight
hits
you
you
can
go
far
very
far
i
must
go
over
to
the
office
now
and
see

chapter
xix
the
thunder
of
the
captains
marian
had
suggested
to
her
mother
that
they
visit
owen
in
town
before
settling
at
waupegan
for
the
summer
and
it
was
marian
planning
that
made
this
excursion
synchronize
with
the
state
convention
bassett
was
not
consulted
in
the
matter
in
fact
since
his
return
from
connecticut
he
had
been
unusually
occupied
and
almost
constantly
away
from
fraserville
bassett
and
her
daughter
arrived
at
the
capital
the
day
after
owen
reached
home
from
wellesley
with
sylvia
and
the
bassetts
listened
perforce
to
their
enthusiastic
account
of
the
commencement
exercises
owen
had
it
appeared
looked
upon
smith
and
mount
holyoke
also
on
this
eastward
flight
and
these
inspections
mentioned
in
the
most
casual
manner
did
not
contribute
to
bassett
happiness
finding
that
her
father
was
inaccessible
by
telephone
marian
summoned
harwood
and
demanded
tickets
for
the
convention
she
would
make
an
occasion
of
it
and
owen
and
sylvia
should
go
with
them
bassett
and
her
family
had
always
enjoyed
the
freedom
of
house
it
was
disheartening
to
find
sylvia
established
in
delaware
street
on
like
terms
of
intimacy
the
old
heartache
over
indifference
to
the
call
of
higher
education
for
women
returned
with
a
new
poignancy
as
bassett
inspected
sylvia
diploma
as
proudly
displayed
by
owen
as
though
it
marked
the
achievement
of
some
near
and
dear
member
of
the
family
sylvia
undeniable
good
looks
her
agreeable
manner
her
ready
talk
and
the
attention
she
received
from
her
elders
were
well
calculated
to
arm
criticism
in
a
prejudiced
heart
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
admiral
and
martin
and
the
reverend
john
ware
had
called
and
while
bassett
assured
herself
that
these
were
in
a
sense
visits
of
condolence
upon
andrew
granddaughter
the
trio
who
were
persons
of
distinction
had
seemed
sincerely
interested
in
owen
protégée
bassett
was
obliged
to
hear
a
lively
dialogue
between
the
minister
and
sylvia
touching
some
memory
of
his
first
encounter
with
her
about
the
stars
he
brought
her
as
a
commencement
present
bacon
essays
people
listened
to
sylvia
sylvia
had
things
to
say
even
the
gruff
admiral
paid
her
deference
he
demanded
to
know
whether
it
was
true
that
sylvia
had
declined
a
position
at
the
naval
observatory
which
required
the
calculation
of
tides
for
the
nautical
almanac
bassett
was
annoyed
that
sylvia
had
refused
a
position
that
would
have
removed
her
from
a
proximity
to
owen
that
struck
her
as
replete
with
danger
and
yet
bassett
was
outwardly
friendly
and
she
privately
counseled
marian
quite
unnecessarily
to
be
nice
to
sylvia
on
the
same
evening
bassett
was
disagreeably
impressed
by
harwood
obvious
rubrication
in
owen
good
books
it
seemed
darkly
portentous
that
dan
was
at
owen
instigation
managing
sylvia
business
affairs
she
must
warn
her
husband
against
this
employment
of
his
secretary
to
strengthen
the
ties
between
owen
and
this
object
of
her
benevolence
bassett
presence
at
the
convention
did
not
pass
unremarked
by
many
gentlemen
upon
the
floor
or
by
the
newspapers
while
the
state
chairman
struggled
to
bring
the
delegates
to
order
miss
marian
bassett
daughter
of
the
honorable
morton
bassett
of
fraser
county
was
a
charming
and
vivacious
figure
in
the
balcony
at
a
moment
when
it
seemed
that
the
band
would
never
cease
from
troubling
the
air
with
the
strains
of
miss
bassett
tossed
a
carnation
into
the
marion
county
delegation
the
flower
was
deftly
caught
by
daniel
harwood
who
wore
it
in
his
buttonhole
throughout
the
strenuous
events
of
the
day
this
item
was
among
the
kodak
shots
subjoined
to
the
advertiser
account
of
the
convention
it
was
stated
elsewhere
in
the
same
journal
that
never
before
had
so
many
ladies
attended
a
state
convention
as
graced
this
occasion
the
wives
of
both
republican
united
states
senators
and
of
many
prominent
politicians
of
both
parties
were
present
their
summer
costumes
giving
to
the
severe
lines
of
the
balcony
a
bright
note
of
color
the
capital
in
its
minor
notes
of
the
day
remarked
upon
the
perfect
amity
that
prevailed
among
the
wives
and
daughters
of
republicans
and
democrats
it
noted
also
the
presence
in
party
of
her
aunt
jackson
owen
and
of
owen
guest
miss
sylvia
garrison
a
graduate
of
this
year
class
at
wellesley
the
experiences
and
sensations
of
a
delegate
to
a
large
convention
are
quite
different
from
those
of
a
reporter
at
the
press
table
as
dan
harwood
realized
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
keyed
to
a
proper
pitch
of
excitement
by
the
day
prospects
in
spite
of
promise
that
he
need
not
trouble
to
help
elect
himself
a
delegate
harwood
had
been
drawn
sharply
into
the
preliminary
skirmish
at
the
primaries
he
had
thought
it
wise
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
the
men
who
ruled
his
own
county
even
though
his
name
had
been
written
large
upon
the
bassett
slate
in
the
weeks
that
intervened
between
his
interview
with
harwood
in
the
upper
room
of
the
whitcomb
and
the
primaries
bassett
had
quietly
visited
every
congressional
district
holding
conferences
and
perfecting
his
plans
never
before
said
the
advertiser
had
morton
pernicious
activity
been
so
marked
the
belief
had
grown
that
the
senator
from
fraser
was
in
imminent
peril
in
the
republican
camp
it
was
thought
that
while
thatcher
might
not
control
the
convention
he
would
prove
himself
strong
enough
to
shake
the
faith
of
many
of
followers
in
the
power
of
their
chief
there
had
been
apparently
a
hot
contest
at
the
primaries
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
in
a
region
long
recognized
as
bassett
stronghold
thatcher
had
won
easily
at
the
capital
the
contestants
had
broken
even
a
result
attributable
to
thatcher
residence
in
the
county
the
word
had
passed
among
the
faithful
that
thatcher
money
was
plentiful
and
that
it
was
not
only
available
in
this
preliminary
skirmish
but
that
those
who
attached
themselves
to
thatcher
early
were
to
enjoy
his
bounty
throughout
his
campaign
which
might
be
protracted
for
the
senatorship
bassett
was
not
scattering
largess
it
was
whispered
that
the
money
he
had
used
previously
in
politics
had
come
out
of
thatcher
pocket
and
that
he
would
have
less
to
spend
in
future
bassett
in
keeping
with
his
forecast
to
harwood
had
made
a
point
of
having
many
new
men
whose
faces
were
unfamiliar
in
state
conventions
chosen
at
the
primaries
he
controlled
so
that
in
a
superficial
view
of
the
convention
the
complexion
of
a
considerable
body
of
the
delegates
was
neutral
here
and
there
among
the
delegations
sat
men
who
knew
precisely
bassett
plans
and
wishes
the
day
following
the
primaries
bassett
closeted
with
harwood
in
his
room
at
the
boordman
building
had
run
the
point
of
a
across
every
county
in
the
state
reciting
from
memory
just
how
many
delegates
he
absolutely
controlled
those
he
could
get
easily
if
he
should
by
any
chance
need
them
and
the
number
of
undoubted
thatcher
men
there
were
to
reckon
with
in
dan
own
mingling
with
the
crowd
at
the
whitcomb
the
night
before
the
convention
he
had
learned
nothing
to
shake
his
faith
in
bassett
calculations
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
of
fraser
was
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
figures
on
the
floor
had
he
not
thrown
off
the
bassett
yoke
and
trampled
the
lord
of
fraser
county
underfoot
did
not
the
opposition
press
applaud
the
editor
for
so
courageously
wresting
from
the
despicable
chieftain
the
control
of
a
county
long
inured
to
slavery
verily
the
honorable
isaac
had
done
much
to
encourage
belief
in
the
guileless
that
such
were
the
facts
even
the
courier
proved
its
sturdy
independence
by
printing
the
result
of
the
primary
without
extenuation
or
aught
set
down
in
malice
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
undoubtedly
believed
in
himself
as
the
savior
of
fraser
he
had
personally
led
the
fight
in
the
fraser
county
primaries
and
had
vanquished
bassett
bassett
had
fought
gamely
the
republican
organ
averred
to
make
more
glorious
the
honorable
isaac
victory
it
was
almost
inconceivable
they
said
that
bassett
who
had
dominated
his
party
for
years
should
not
be
able
to
elect
himself
a
delegate
to
a
state
convention
in
a
statement
printed
in
the
courier
bassett
had
accepted
defeat
in
a
commendable
spirit
of
resignation
he
and
atwill
had
framed
that
statement
a
week
before
the
primaries
and
miss
rose
farrell
had
copied
at
least
a
dozen
drafts
before
bassett
critical
sense
was
satisfied
harwood
was
increasingly
amused
by
the
manifestations
of
ironic
humor
i
have
never
yet
ran
the
statement
placed
my
own
ambitions
before
the
wishes
of
my
party
and
if
when
the
democrats
of
fraser
county
meet
to
choose
a
candidate
for
state
senator
they
are
not
disposed
to
renominate
me
for
a
seat
which
i
have
held
for
twelve
years
i
shall
gladly
resign
to
another
and
give
my
loyal
support
to
the
candidate
of
their
choice
it
was
whispered
that
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
would
himself
be
a
candidate
for
the
nomination
the
chattel
mortgage
scrolls
in
the
office
of
the
recorder
of
fraser
county
indicated
that
his
no
longer
owed
allegiance
to
the
honorable
morton
bassett
thatcher
had
treated
pettit
generously
taking
his
unsecured
note
for
the
amount
advanced
to
cleanse
the
fraser
county
democrat
of
the
taint
of
bassettism
as
they
gathered
in
the
convention
hall
many
of
the
delegates
were
unable
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
fact
that
bassett
had
not
only
failed
of
election
as
delegate
from
his
own
county
but
that
he
was
not
even
present
as
a
spectator
of
the
convention
the
scene
was
set
the
curtain
had
risen
but
hamlet
came
not
to
the
platform
before
the
castle
many
men
sought
harwood
and
inquired
in
awed
whispers
as
to
whereabouts
but
he
gave
evasive
answers
he
knew
however
that
bassett
had
taken
an
early
morning
train
for
waupegan
accompanied
by
fitch
their
purpose
being
to
discuss
in
peace
and
quiet
the
legal
proceeding
begun
to
gain
control
of
the
courier
the
few
tried
and
trusted
bassett
men
who
knew
exactly
bassett
plans
for
the
convention
listened
in
silence
to
the
hubbub
occasioned
by
their
chief
absence
silence
was
a
distinguishing
trait
of
bassett
lieutenants
among
the
uninitiated
there
were
those
who
fondly
believed
that
bassett
was
killed
not
scotched
and
they
said
among
themselves
that
the
party
and
the
state
were
well
rid
of
him
thatcher
was
to
be
reckoned
with
but
he
was
no
worse
than
bassett
with
such
cogitations
they
comforted
themselves
amid
the
noise
and
confusion
the
old
bassett
superstition
held
however
with
many
this
was
only
another
of
the
boss
schemes
and
he
would
show
his
hand
in
due
season
and
prove
himself
as
usual
master
of
the
situation
others
imagined
that
bassett
was
sulking
and
these
were
not
anxious
to
be
the
target
of
his
wrath
when
he
chose
to
emerge
from
his
tent
in
full
armor
a
young
woman
reporter
traversing
the
galleries
to
note
the
names
and
gowns
of
the
ladies
present
sought
bassett
for
information
as
to
her
husband
whereabouts
when
bassett
hesitated
discreetly
marian
rose
promptly
to
the
occasion
papa
gone
fishing
she
replied
suavely
this
was
not
slow
to
reach
the
floor
papa
gone
fishing
gained
wide
currency
as
the
answer
to
the
most
interesting
question
of
the
day
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
seated
majestically
with
the
fraser
county
delegation
tested
the
acoustics
of
the
hall
at
the
first
opportunity
while
the
chairman
of
the
state
central
committee
was
endeavoring
to
present
as
the
temporary
chairman
of
the
convention
a
patriot
known
as
the
war
eagle
of
the
wabash
the
gentleman
from
fraser
insisted
upon
recognition
who
is
that
preposterous
fat
man
demanded
owen
plying
her
fan
vigorously
that
pettit
from
our
town
said
bassett
he
an
editor
and
lecturer
he
the
man
that
defeated
papa
in
our
primaries
added
marian
cheerfully
he
awfully
funny
everybody
says
and
i
suppose
his
defeating
papa
was
a
joke
he
going
to
say
something
funny
now
he
does
need
to
said
sylvia
not
the
least
interested
of
the
spectators
they
are
laughing
before
he
begins
the
chairman
of
the
state
committee
feigned
not
to
hear
or
see
the
delegate
from
fraser
but
pettit
continued
to
importune
the
chair
amid
much
laughter
and
confusion
the
chairman
had
hardened
his
heart
but
the
voice
of
the
gentleman
from
fraser
alone
rose
above
the
tumult
and
in
a
moment
of
comparative
calm
he
addressed
the
chair
unrecognized
and
unpermitted
i
beg
to
call
your
attention
sir
to
the
presence
in
the
gallery
of
many
of
the
fair
daughters
of
the
old
hoosier
state
applause
they
hover
above
us
like
guardian
angels
they
have
come
in
the
spirit
that
brought
their
sisters
of
old
to
watch
true
knights
battle
in
the
tourney
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
these
ladies
who
do
us
so
much
honor
i
ask
the
chair
to
request
gentlemen
to
desist
from
smoking
and
that
the
be
ordered
to
enforce
the
rule
throughout
our
deliberations
applause
the
state
chairman
was
annoyed
and
showed
his
annoyance
he
had
been
about
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
ladies
by
making
this
request
unprompted
he
made
it
now
but
the
gentleman
from
fraser
sat
down
conscious
that
the
renewed
applause
was
his
why
do
they
keep
on
smoking
asked
owen
the
hall
be
any
fuller
of
smoke
than
it
is
now
if
they
would
all
put
on
their
coats
the
room
would
be
more
beautiful
said
marian
they
always
say
the
republicans
are
much
more
gentlemanly
than
the
democrats
hush
marian
some
one
might
hear
you
bassett
cautioned
she
did
not
understand
her
husband
absence
he
rarely
or
never
took
her
into
his
confidence
in
political
matters
she
had
not
known
until
that
morning
that
he
was
not
to
be
present
at
the
convention
she
did
not
relish
the
idea
that
he
had
been
defeated
in
the
primaries
in
her
mind
defeat
was
inseparable
from
dishonor
the
war
eagle
of
the
wabash
was
in
excellent
voice
and
he
spoke
for
thirty
minutes
his
speech
would
have
aroused
greater
enthusiasm
if
it
had
not
been
heard
in
many
previous
state
conventions
and
on
the
hustings
through
many
campaigns
dan
voorhees
had
once
expressed
his
admiration
of
that
speech
and
it
was
said
that
tom
hendricks
had
revised
the
original
manuscript
the
year
he
was
chosen
it
was
a
safe
speech
containing
nothing
that
any
good
american
might
not
applaud
it
named
practically
every
democratic
president
except
the
and
whom
it
seemed
the
better
part
of
valor
just
then
to
ignore
with
slight
emendations
that
same
oration
served
admirably
for
commencements
and
it
had
a
recognized
cash
value
on
the
chautauqua
circuit
the
peroration
closing
with
thou
too
sail
on
o
ship
of
state
was
well
calculated
to
bring
strong
men
to
their
feet
the
only
complaint
the
war
eagle
might
have
lodged
against
the
ship
of
state
in
some
imaginable
admiralty
court
having
jurisdiction
of
that
barnacled
old
frigate
would
have
been
for
its
rejection
of
his
own
piloting
the
permanent
chairman
now
disclosed
was
a
man
of
business
who
thanked
the
convention
briefly
and
went
to
work
by
the
time
the
committee
on
resolutions
had
presented
the
platform
on
which
bassett
and
harwood
had
collaborated
the
convention
enjoyed
its
first
sensation
as
thatcher
appeared
moving
slowly
down
the
crowded
main
aisle
to
join
the
delegation
of
his
county
his
friends
had
planned
a
demonstration
for
his
entrance
and
in
calling
it
an
ovation
the
newspapers
hardly
magnified
its
apparent
spontaneity
and
volume
the
man
who
had
undertaken
the
herculean
task
of
driving
morton
bassett
out
of
politics
was
entitled
to
consideration
and
his
appearance
undoubtedly
interrupted
the
business
of
the
convention
for
fully
five
minutes
thatcher
bowed
and
waved
his
hand
as
he
sat
down
the
cordiality
of
his
reception
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
him
he
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
and
feigned
indifference
to
the
admiration
of
his
countrymen
papa
always
gets
more
applause
than
that
marian
remarked
to
sylvia
i
was
at
the
state
convention
two
years
ago
and
father
came
in
late
just
as
thatcher
did
they
always
come
in
late
after
all
the
stupid
speeches
have
been
made
they
surer
to
stir
up
a
big
rumpus
that
way
sylvia
gave
serious
heed
to
these
transactions
of
history
her
knowledge
of
politics
was
largely
derived
from
lectures
she
had
heard
at
college
and
from
a
diligent
reading
of
newspapers
the
report
of
the
committee
on
resolutions
a
succinct
document
to
each
of
whose
paragraphs
the
delegates
rose
in
stormy
approval
had
just
been
read
i
do
see
how
you
can
listen
to
such
stuff
said
marian
during
a
lull
in
the
shouting
it
only
the
platform
and
they
do
mean
a
word
of
it
there
colonel
ramsay
of
aurora
the
man
with
white
hair
who
has
just
come
on
the
stage
he
had
dinner
at
our
house
once
and
perfectly
lovely
he
a
beautiful
speaker
but
they
wo
let
him
speak
any
more
because
he
was
a
gold
bug
whatever
that
is
they
say
colonel
ramsay
has
stopped
now
and
wants
to
be
governor
sylvia
all
these
men
that
do
want
to
be
united
states
senator
want
to
be
governor
is
it
funny
i
do
see
why
silver
money
is
just
as
good
as
any
other
kind
do
you
they
told
me
at
college
said
sylvia
but
it
rather
complicated
why
did
your
father
come
to
the
convention
even
if
he
was
a
delegate
he
could
have
sat
in
the
gallery
i
suppose
a
lot
of
those
men
down
there
are
not
really
delegates
oh
that
would
be
papa
way
of
doing
things
i
wish
he
had
come
just
on
mama
account
she
takes
everything
so
hard
if
papa
ever
did
half
the
naughty
things
they
say
he
does
he
be
in
the
penitentiary
good
and
tight
i
should
like
to
marry
a
public
man
if
i
trusted
a
man
enough
to
marry
him
i
should
be
jarred
a
bit
by
what
the
newspapers
said
of
him
i
like
politics
i
do
know
what
it
all
about
but
i
think
the
men
are
ever
so
interesting
i
think
so
too
said
sylvia
only
i
do
understand
why
they
make
so
much
noise
and
do
so
little
that
platform
they
read
a
little
bit
ago
seemed
splendid
i
read
a
lot
of
political
platforms
once
in
college
they
were
part
of
the
course
and
that
was
the
best
one
i
ever
heard
it
declared
for
laws
against
child
labor
and
i
interested
in
that
and
for
juvenile
courts
and
a
lot
of
the
new
enlightened
things
it
was
all
fine
do
you
think
so
it
sounded
just
like
a
trombone
solo
to
me
harwood
was
on
that
committee
did
you
hear
his
name
read
he
one
of
these
high
brows
in
politics
and
father
going
to
push
him
forward
so
he
can
accomplish
the
noble
things
that
interest
him
father
told
me
harwood
would
be
a
delegate
to
the
convention
that
the
reason
i
wanted
to
come
i
hope
he
will
make
a
speech
they
say
he
one
of
the
best
of
the
younger
men
i
heard
him
at
the
opera
house
at
fraserville
in
the
last
campaign
and
he
kept
me
awake
i
can
tell
you
and
funny
you
would
think
he
could
be
funny
oh
i
can
see
that
he
has
humor
the
lines
around
his
mouth
show
that
they
had
discussed
the
convention
and
its
possibilities
at
breakfast
table
and
with
the
morning
newspapers
as
their
texts
sylvia
had
gained
the
impression
that
bassett
had
met
a
serious
defeat
in
the
choice
of
delegates
and
she
had
been
conscious
that
bassett
was
distressed
by
the
newspaper
accounts
of
it
marian
bubbled
on
elucidatively
answering
all
of
sylvia
questions
do
you
think
that
because
papa
is
here
he
wo
be
heard
from
i
think
i
know
papa
better
than
that
he
did
think
this
convention
would
amount
to
enough
for
him
to
trouble
with
it
i
told
aunt
sally
not
to
talk
much
before
mother
about
papa
and
politics
you
will
notice
that
aunt
sally
turned
the
subject
several
times
this
morning
that
lawsuit
thatcher
brought
against
papa
and
aunt
sally
made
her
pretty
hot
but
papa
will
fix
that
up
all
right
papa
always
fixes
up
everything
she
concluded
admiringly
it
was
in
sylvia
mind
that
she
was
witnessing
a
scene
of
the
national
drama
and
that
these
men
beneath
her
in
the
noisy
hall
were
engaged
upon
matters
more
or
less
remotely
related
to
the
business
of
she
had
derived
at
college
a
fair
idea
of
the
questions
of
the
day
but
the
parliamentary
mechanism
and
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
gave
to
politics
a
new
concrete
expression
these
delegates
drawn
from
all
occupations
and
conditions
of
life
were
citizens
of
a
republic
endeavoring
to
put
into
tangible
form
their
ideas
and
preferences
and
similar
assemblies
had
she
knew
for
years
been
meeting
in
every
american
commonwealth
enacting
just
such
scenes
as
those
that
were
passing
under
her
eyes
her
gravity
amused
owen
do
you
worry
sylvia
they
are
all
kind
to
their
families
and
most
of
earn
an
honest
living
i
attended
lots
of
conventions
of
all
parties
and
they
all
about
alike
there
are
more
standing
collars
in
a
republican
convention
and
more
whiskers
when
the
prohibitionists
get
together
but
they
all
mostly
and
human
a
few
fellows
with
brains
in
their
heads
run
all
the
rest
look
marian
harwood
seems
to
be
getting
ready
to
do
something
said
sylvia
i
wonder
what
that
paper
is
he
has
in
his
hand
he
been
holding
it
all
morning
harwood
sat
immediately
under
them
several
times
men
had
passed
notes
to
him
whereupon
he
had
risen
and
searched
out
the
writer
to
give
his
answer
with
a
nod
or
shake
of
the
head
when
thatcher
appeared
dan
had
waited
for
the
hubbub
to
subside
and
then
he
left
his
seat
to
shake
hands
with
bassett
quondam
ally
he
held
meanwhile
a
bit
of
notepaper
the
size
of
his
hand
and
scrutinized
it
carefully
from
time
to
time
it
contained
the
precise
programme
of
the
convention
as
arranged
by
bassett
morton
bassett
was
on
a
train
bound
for
the
pastoral
shades
of
waupegan
a
hundred
miles
away
but
the
permanent
chairman
had
in
his
vest
pocket
a
copy
of
bassett
scheme
of
exercises
even
rapturous
greeting
had
been
ordered
by
bassett
there
had
already
been
one
slight
slip
the
eagerness
of
the
delegates
to
proceed
to
the
selection
of
the
state
ticket
had
sent
matters
forward
for
a
moment
beyond
the
chairman
control
a
delegate
with
a
weak
voice
had
gained
recognition
for
the
laudable
purpose
of
suggesting
a
limitation
upon
nominating
speeches
the
permanent
chairman
had
mistaken
him
for
another
gentleman
for
whom
he
was
prepared
and
he
hastened
to
correct
his
blunder
he
seized
the
gavel
and
began
pounding
vigorously
and
the
man
with
the
weak
voice
never
again
caught
his
eye
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
a
delegate
now
drew
attention
to
himself
by
rising
upon
a
chair
he
held
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
waved
it
and
the
chairman
promptly
took
cognizance
of
him
the
chairman
referred
to
him
as
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
but
he
might
have
been
the
gentleman
from
vallombrosa
for
all
that
any
one
cared
the
convention
was
annoyed
that
a
gentleman
from
pulaski
county
should
have
dared
to
flourish
manuscript
when
there
were
innumerable
orators
present
fully
prepared
to
speak
extempore
on
any
subject
for
all
that
any
one
knew
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
might
be
primed
with
a
speech
on
the
chinch
bug
or
the
jewish
kritarchy
a
man
with
a
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
was
a
formidable
person
if
not
indeed
a
foe
of
mankind
and
he
was
certainly
not
to
be
countenaced
or
encouraged
in
a
hot
hall
on
a
day
of
june
yet
all
other
human
beings
save
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
were
as
nothing
it
seemed
to
the
chairman
the
tallest
delegate
around
whose
lean
form
a
frock
coat
hung
like
a
fold
of
night
and
who
flung
back
from
a
white
brow
an
immense
quantity
of
raven
hair
sought
to
relieve
the
convention
of
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
person
from
pulaski
the
tallest
delegate
was
called
smartly
to
order
he
rebelled
but
when
threatened
with
the
subsided
amid
jeers
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
was
indulged
to
the
fullest
extent
by
the
chairman
to
whom
it
had
occurred
suddenly
that
the
aisles
must
be
cleared
the
aisles
were
cleared
and
delegates
were
obliged
to
find
their
seats
before
the
unknown
gentleman
from
pulaski
was
allowed
to
proceed
even
the
war
eagle
had
received
no
such
consideration
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
calmly
waited
for
a
completer
silence
than
the
day
had
known
ten
men
in
the
hall
knew
what
was
coming
not
more
miss
rose
farrell
had
typed
ten
copies
of
the
memorandum
which
harwood
held
in
his
hand
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
did
not
after
all
refer
to
his
manuscript
he
spoke
in
a
high
penetrating
voice
that
reached
the
farthest
corner
of
the
hall
reciting
from
memory
be
it
resolved
by
this
convention
that
whereas
two
years
hence
it
will
be
the
privilege
and
duty
of
the
indiana
democracy
to
elect
a
united
states
senator
to
fill
the
seat
now
occupied
by
a
republican
we
the
delegates
here
assembled
do
hereby
pledge
the
party
support
for
the
office
of
senator
in
congress
to
the
honorable
edward
thatcher
of
marion
county
there
was
a
moment
awed
calm
before
the
storm
broke
thatcher
rose
in
his
seat
to
look
at
the
strange
gentleman
from
pulaski
who
had
thus
flung
his
name
into
the
arena
thatcher
men
rose
and
clamored
blindly
for
recognition
without
the
faintest
idea
of
what
they
should
do
if
haply
the
cold
eye
of
the
chairman
fell
upon
them
the
galleries
joined
in
the
uproar
the
band
began
to
play
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
and
was
with
difficulty
stopped
a
few
voices
cried
bassett
but
cries
of
thatcher
rose
in
a
mighty
roar
and
drowned
them
the
chairman
hammered
monotonously
for
order
daniel
harwood
might
have
been
seen
to
thrust
his
memorandum
into
his
trousers
pocket
he
bent
forward
in
his
seat
with
his
eye
upon
the
chairman
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
had
been
for
a
moment
nonplussed
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
nor
had
he
known
that
an
effort
was
to
be
made
to
commit
the
convention
to
thatcher
candidacy
still
the
tone
of
the
resolution
was
friendly
thatcher
rising
to
his
feet
was
noisily
cheered
his
face
was
red
and
his
manner
betokened
anger
but
after
glancing
helplessly
over
the
hall
he
sank
into
his
seat
the
chairman
thumped
with
his
gavel
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
he
had
lost
control
of
the
convention
and
now
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
was
observed
demanding
to
be
heard
the
chairman
lifted
his
hand
and
the
noise
died
away
it
lay
in
his
power
to
ignore
the
resolution
wholly
or
to
rule
it
out
of
order
the
chairman
was
apparently
in
no
haste
to
do
anything
good
old
uncle
ike
howled
some
one
encouragingly
and
there
was
laughter
and
applause
with
superb
dignity
pettit
appealed
for
silence
with
gestures
that
expressed
humility
and
latent
power
in
one
who
would
in
due
course
explain
everything
a
group
of
delegates
in
the
rear
began
chanting
stridently
order
order
and
it
was
flung
back
antiphonally
from
a
dozen
other
delegations
harwood
became
active
and
climbed
upon
his
chair
gentlemen
in
every
part
of
the
hall
seemed
at
once
anxious
to
speak
but
the
chairman
was
apparently
oblivious
of
all
but
the
delegate
from
marion
the
delegate
from
marion
like
the
mysterious
person
from
pulaski
was
a
stranger
to
state
conventions
the
ladies
were
at
once
interested
in
the
young
gentleman
with
the
red
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
a
trim
young
fellow
in
a
blue
serge
suit
with
a
blue
knotted
under
a
white
winged
collar
as
he
waited
with
his
eye
on
the
chairman
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
smoothed
his
hair
is
daniel
going
to
speak
asked
owen
he
ought
to
have
asked
me
if
he
going
to
back
edward
thatcher
for
senator
i
always
think
his
cowlick
so
funny
he
certainly
the
cool
one
said
marian
i
do
know
what
they
talking
about
a
senator
for
said
bassett
it
very
unusual
if
i
known
they
were
going
to
talk
about
that
i
should
have
come
there
sure
to
be
a
row
the
chairman
seemed
anxious
that
the
delegate
from
marion
should
be
honored
with
the
same
close
attention
that
had
been
secured
for
the
stranger
from
pulaski
i
hope
he
wait
till
they
all
sit
down
said
sylvia
i
want
to
hear
him
speak
you
hear
him
all
right
said
marian
you
know
at
yale
they
called
him
harwood
and
they
put
him
in
front
to
lead
the
cheering
at
all
the
big
games
apparently
something
was
expected
of
harwood
of
marion
thatcher
had
left
his
seat
and
was
moving
toward
the
corridors
to
find
his
lieutenants
half
a
dozen
men
accosted
him
as
he
moved
through
the
aisle
but
he
shook
them
off
angrily
an
effort
to
start
another
demonstration
in
his
honor
was
not
wholly
fruitless
it
resulted
at
least
in
a
good
deal
of
confusion
of
which
the
chair
was
briefly
tolerant
then
he
resumed
his
pounding
while
harwood
stood
stubbornly
on
his
chair
the
tallest
delegate
known
to
be
a
recent
convert
to
thatcher
was
thoroughly
aroused
and
advanced
toward
the
platform
shouting
but
the
chairman
leveled
his
gavel
at
him
and
bade
him
sit
down
the
moment
was
critical
the
veriest
tyro
felt
the
brooding
over
the
hall
the
voice
of
the
chairman
was
now
audible
the
chair
recognizes
the
delegate
from
marion
out
of
order
what
his
name
howled
many
voices
the
chairman
graciously
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
announce
the
name
of
the
gentleman
he
had
recognized
harwood
of
marion
has
the
floor
the
convention
will
be
in
order
the
gentleman
will
proceed
chairman
i
rise
to
a
point
of
order
dan
voice
rose
sonorously
the
convention
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
gentleman
in
blue
serge
could
be
heard
he
was
audible
even
to
thatcher
excited
counsellors
in
the
corridors
the
delegate
will
kindly
state
his
point
of
order
the
chairman
was
quietly
courteous
his
right
hand
rested
on
his
gavel
he
thrust
his
left
into
the
side
pocket
of
his
long
alpaca
coat
he
was
an
old
and
tried
hand
in
the
chair
and
his
own
deep
absorption
in
the
remarks
of
harwood
communicated
itself
to
the
delegates
dan
uttered
rapidly
the
speech
he
had
committed
to
memory
for
this
occasion
a
week
earlier
every
sentence
had
been
carefully
pondered
both
bassett
and
atwill
had
blue
penciled
it
until
it
expressed
concisely
and
pointedly
exactly
what
bassett
wished
to
be
said
at
this
point
in
the
convention
proceedings
interruptions
of
applause
or
derision
were
to
be
reckoned
with
but
the
speaker
did
not
once
drop
his
voice
or
pause
long
enough
for
any
one
to
drive
in
a
wedge
of
protest
he
might
have
been
swamped
by
an
uprising
of
the
whole
convention
but
strange
to
say
the
convention
was
intent
upon
hearing
him
once
the
horde
of
candidates
and
distinguished
visitors
on
the
platform
had
been
won
to
attention
harwood
turned
slowly
until
he
faced
the
greater
crowd
behind
him
several
times
he
lifted
his
right
hand
and
struck
out
with
it
shaking
his
head
with
the
vigor
of
his
utterance
his
voice
said
the
advertiser
report
rumbles
and
bangs
like
a
on
saturday
night
there
was
a
big
bump
every
time
a
sentence
rumbled
down
the
hall
and
struck
the
rear
wall
of
the
building
sir
i
make
the
obvious
point
of
order
that
there
are
no
vacancies
to
fill
in
the
office
of
united
states
senator
and
that
it
does
not
lie
within
the
province
of
the
delegates
chosen
to
this
convention
to
pledge
the
party
to
any
man
i
do
not
question
the
motive
of
the
delegate
from
pulaski
county
who
is
my
personal
friend
and
i
am
animated
by
no
feelings
of
animosity
in
demanding
that
the
convention
proceed
to
the
discharge
of
its
obligations
without
touching
upon
matters
clearly
beyond
its
powers
i
confidently
hope
and
sincerely
believe
that
our
party
in
indiana
is
soon
to
receive
a
new
commission
of
trust
and
confidence
from
the
people
of
the
old
hoosier
state
but
our
immediate
business
is
the
choice
of
a
ticket
behind
which
the
hoosier
democracy
will
move
on
to
victory
in
november
like
an
army
with
banners
cheers
there
have
been
intimations
in
the
camp
of
our
enemy
that
the
party
is
threatened
with
schism
and
menaced
by
factional
wars
but
i
declare
my
conviction
that
the
party
is
more
harmonious
and
more
truly
devoted
to
high
ideals
than
at
any
time
since
the
grand
old
name
of
democrat
became
potent
upon
hoosier
soil
and
what
have
we
to
do
with
leaders
men
come
and
men
go
but
principles
alone
are
eternal
and
live
forever
the
great
task
of
our
party
must
be
to
bring
the
government
back
to
the
people
scattering
applause
but
the
choice
of
an
invulnerable
state
ticket
at
this
convention
is
our
business
and
our
only
business
as
for
indiana
two
seats
in
the
national
senate
which
we
shall
soon
wrest
from
our
adversaries
in
due
season
we
shall
fill
them
with
tried
men
and
true
sir
let
us
remember
that
whosoever
maketh
himself
a
king
speaketh
against
caesar
stop
look
listen
hardly
a
man
in
the
hall
so
dull
that
this
did
not
penetrate
dan
had
given
to
his
last
words
a
weird
mournful
intonation
whose
effect
was
startling
he
jumped
lightly
to
the
floor
and
was
in
his
seat
before
the
deep
boom
of
his
voice
had
ceased
reverberating
then
instantly
it
seemed
that
the
seventeen
hundred
delegates
had
been
multiplied
by
ten
and
that
every
man
had
become
a
raving
lunatic
this
was
defiance
bassett
who
had
gone
fishing
but
not
before
planting
this
mine
for
the
confusion
of
thatcher
a
hundred
men
who
had
already
committed
themselves
to
thatcher
sought
to
rescue
their
new
leader
they
rose
upon
chairs
and
demanded
to
be
heard
stop
look
listen
had
suggested
the
idea
of
a
locomotive
bearing
down
upon
a
dangerous
crossing
and
bassett
men
began
to
whistle
the
whistling
increased
in
volume
until
it
drowned
the
shouts
the
cheers
and
the
laughter
ladies
in
the
galleries
stopped
their
ears
while
the
whistling
convention
earned
its
name
it
now
occurred
to
the
chairman
who
had
wasted
no
energy
in
futile
efforts
to
stay
the
storm
that
he
had
a
duty
to
perform
even
to
his
practiced
hand
the
restoration
of
order
was
not
easy
but
by
dint
of
much
bawling
and
pounding
he
subdued
the
uproar
then
after
impressive
deliberation
he
said
a
point
of
order
has
been
raised
against
the
resolution
offered
by
the
gentleman
from
pulaski
it
is
the
ruling
of
the
chair
that
the
point
is
well
taken
the
resolution
is
out
of
order
this
was
greeted
with
great
applause
but
the
chair
checked
it
promptly
the
ten
gentlemen
who
had
copies
of
the
bassett
programme
in
their
pockets
were
not
surprised
by
the
decision
thatcher
stood
at
a
side
door
and
two
of
his
men
were
pushing
their
way
through
the
aisles
to
reach
pettit
for
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
was
on
his
feet
demanding
recognition
while
thatcher
delegates
shouted
to
him
to
sit
down
humiliation
must
go
no
farther
and
if
the
fraser
county
editor
did
not
realize
that
his
new
chief
was
the
victim
of
a
vile
trick
the
gentleman
from
fraser
must
be
throttled
if
necessary
to
prevent
a
further
affront
to
thatcher
dignity
thatcher
was
purple
with
rage
it
was
enough
to
have
been
made
the
plaything
of
an
unscrupulous
enemy
once
without
having
one
ambitions
repeatedly
kicked
up
and
down
a
convention
hall
the
chairman
fully
rehearsed
in
his
part
showed
a
malevolent
disposition
to
continue
toward
the
friends
of
thatcher
an
attitude
at
once
benevolent
and
just
so
many
were
demanding
recognition
amid
and
whistling
that
the
fairest
and
least
partial
of
presiding
officers
might
well
have
hesitated
before
singling
out
one
gentleman
when
so
many
were
eagerly
even
furiously
desirous
of
enlightening
the
convention
but
the
presiding
officer
was
obeying
the
orders
communicated
to
him
by
a
gentleman
who
was
even
at
this
moment
skimming
across
the
cool
waters
of
lake
waupegan
it
would
more
fully
have
satisfied
the
chairman
sense
of
humor
to
have
recognized
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
and
have
suffered
an
appeal
from
the
ruling
of
the
chair
which
presumably
the
editor
wished
to
demand
by
this
means
the
weakness
of
thatcher
might
have
expressed
itself
in
figures
that
would
have
deepened
thatcher
abasement
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
partisans
but
this
idea
had
been
discussed
with
bassett
who
had
sharply
vetoed
it
and
the
chairman
was
not
a
man
lightly
to
disobey
orders
even
to
make
a
hoosier
holiday
he
failed
to
see
the
editor
of
the
fraser
county
democrat
and
peremptorily
closed
the
incident
there
was
no
mistaking
his
temper
as
he
announced
the
chair
announces
that
the
next
business
in
order
is
the
call
of
the
roll
of
counties
for
nominations
for
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
what
is
the
pleasure
of
the
convention
colonel
ramsay
had
repaired
to
the
gallery
to
enjoy
the
proceedings
with
bassett
party
in
spite
of
his
support
of
the
palmer
and
buckner
ticket
how
long
ago
that
seems
the
colonel
had
never
lost
touch
with
the
main
body
of
his
party
and
he
carried
several
indiana
counties
in
his
pocket
his
relations
with
bassett
had
never
been
in
the
least
intimate
though
always
outwardly
cordial
and
there
were
those
who
looked
to
him
to
eliminate
the
fraser
county
chief
from
politics
he
was
quite
as
rich
as
bassett
and
a
successful
lawyer
who
had
become
a
colonel
by
grace
of
a
staff
appointment
in
the
spanish
war
he
had
a
weakness
for
the
poets
and
his
speeches
were
informed
with
that
grace
and
sentiment
which
we
are
fond
of
saying
is
peculiar
to
southern
oratory
the
colonel
at
all
fitting
occasions
in
our
commonwealth
responded
to
the
ladies
in
tender
and
moving
phrases
he
was
a
bachelor
and
the
ladies
in
the
gallery
saw
in
him
their
true
champion
please
tell
we
do
understand
a
bit
of
it
pleaded
marian
what
it
all
about
colonel
ramsay
oh
it
just
a
little
joke
of
your
father
nothing
funnier
ever
happened
in
a
state
convention
colonel
ramsay
grinned
the
key
to
the
situation
is
right
there
that
pulaski
county
delegate
offered
his
resolution
just
to
make
trouble
it
was
a
fake
resolution
of
course
the
chairman
is
in
the
joke
this
young
fellow
down
here
yes
harwood
made
his
speech
to
add
to
the
gayety
of
nations
he
had
no
right
to
make
it
of
course
but
the
word
had
been
passed
along
the
line
to
let
him
go
through
amazing
vocal
powers
that
boy
you
could
have
stopped
him
sylvia
was
aware
that
colonel
ramsay
explanation
had
not
pleased
bassett
but
owen
evinced
no
feeling
marian
was
enjoying
colonel
ramsay
praise
of
her
father
adroitness
near
sylvia
were
other
women
who
had
much
at
stake
in
the
result
of
the
convention
the
wife
of
a
candidate
for
secretary
of
state
had
invited
herself
to
a
seat
beside
bassett
the
wife
of
a
congressman
who
wished
to
be
governor
sat
near
publishing
to
the
world
her
intimate
acquaintance
with
morton
bassett
family
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
these
women
during
the
day
interested
sylvia
almost
as
much
as
the
incidents
occurring
on
the
floor
it
was
a
new
idea
that
politics
had
a
bearing
upon
the
domestic
life
of
the
men
who
engaged
in
the
eternal
contest
for
place
and
power
the
convention
as
a
spectacle
was
immensely
diverting
but
she
had
her
misgivings
about
it
as
a
transaction
in
history
colonel
ramsay
asked
her
politics
and
she
confessed
that
she
had
none
she
had
inherited
republican
prejudices
from
her
grandfather
and
most
of
the
girls
she
had
known
in
college
were
of
republican
antecedents
but
she
liked
to
call
herself
an
independent
you
better
not
be
a
democrat
sylvia
owen
warned
her
i
suffered
a
good
deal
in
my
husband
lifetime
from
being
one
there
are
still
people
in
this
town
who
think
a
democrat
the
same
as
a
rebel
or
a
copperhead
it
ai
hardly
respectable
yet
being
a
democrat
and
if
they
do
all
of
shut
up
about
the
and
the
constitution
i
going
to
move
to
mexico
where
it
all
run
by
niggers
sylvia
had
singled
out
several
figures
in
the
drama
enacting
below
for
special
attention
the
chairman
had
interested
her
by
reason
of
his
attitude
of
scrupulous
fairness
in
which
she
now
saw
the
transparent
irony
the
banalities
of
the
temporary
chairman
had
touched
her
humor
she
watched
him
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
a
kind
of
awe
that
any
one
could
he
so
dull
so
timorous
and
yet
be
chosen
to
address
nearly
two
thousand
american
citizens
on
an
occasion
of
importance
she
was
unable
to
reconcile
thatcher
bald
head
ruddy
neck
and
heavy
shoulders
with
marian
description
of
the
rich
man
son
who
dreamed
of
heroes
and
played
at
carpentry
dan
speech
had
not
been
without
its
thrill
for
her
and
she
now
realized
its
significance
it
had
been
a
part
of
a
trick
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
could
not
share
the
admiration
colonel
ramsay
was
expressing
for
harwood
share
in
it
he
was
immeasurably
superior
to
the
majority
of
those
about
him
in
the
crowded
hall
he
was
a
man
of
education
a
college
man
and
she
had
just
experienced
in
her
own
life
that
consecration
as
by
an
apostolic
of
hands
by
which
a
college
confers
its
honors
and
imposes
its
obligations
upon
those
who
have
enjoyed
its
ministry
yet
harwood
who
had
not
struck
her
as
weak
or
frivolous
had
lent
himself
to
a
bit
of
cheap
claptrap
merely
to
humble
one
man
for
the
glorification
of
another
bassett
she
had
sincerely
liked
in
their
one
meeting
at
waupegan
and
yet
this
was
of
his
plotting
and
harwood
was
his
mouthpiece
and
tool
it
did
not
seem
fair
to
take
advantage
of
such
supreme
stupidity
as
thatcher
supporters
had
manifested
her
disappointment
in
harwood
and
it
was
quite
that
was
part
of
her
general
disappointment
in
the
methods
by
which
men
transacted
the
serious
business
of
governing
themselves
harwood
was
conscious
that
he
was
one
of
the
chief
figures
in
the
convention
every
one
knew
him
now
he
was
called
here
and
there
on
the
floor
by
men
anxious
to
impress
themselves
upon
bassett
authorized
spokesman
it
is
a
fine
thing
at
to
find
the
doors
of
opportunity
flung
wide
and
had
he
not
crossed
the
threshold
and
passed
within
the
portal
he
was
bassett
man
every
one
knew
that
now
but
why
should
he
not
be
bassett
man
he
would
go
higher
and
farther
than
bassett
bassett
had
merely
supplied
the
ladder
on
which
he
would
climb
he
was
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
before
in
his
life
he
had
experienced
the
intoxication
of
applause
and
he
was
not
averse
to
the
glances
of
the
women
in
the
gallery
above
him
the
nomination
of
candidates
now
went
forward
rather
tamely
though
relieved
by
occasional
sharp
contests
the
ten
gentlemen
who
had
been
favored
with
copies
of
the
bassett
programme
were
not
surprised
that
so
many
of
thatcher
friends
were
nominated
they
themselves
voted
for
most
of
them
it
seemed
remarkable
to
the
uninitiated
that
bassett
should
have
slapped
thatcher
and
then
have
allowed
him
to
score
in
the
choice
of
the
ticket
the
advertiser
anxious
to
show
bassett
as
strong
and
malignant
as
possible
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
fraserville
boss
had
not
after
all
appreciated
the
full
force
of
the
thatcher
movement
on
the
veranda
of
his
waupegan
cottage
bassett
and
fitch
enjoyed
the
wholesome
airs
of
the
country
late
in
the
afternoon
the
fussy
little
steamer
that
traversed
the
lake
paused
at
the
bassett
dock
to
deliver
a
telegram
which
bassett
read
without
emotion
he
passed
the
yellow
slip
of
paper
to
fitch
who
read
it
and
handed
it
back
harwood
a
clever
fellow
but
you
ought
to
push
him
into
politics
he
better
than
that
i
suppose
he
is
said
bassett
but
i
need
him
chapter
xx
interviews
in
two
keys
bassett
remained
in
bed
the
day
following
the
convention
less
exhausted
by
the
scenes
she
had
witnessed
than
appalled
by
their
interpretation
in
the
newspapers
the
reappearance
of
sylvia
garrison
had
revived
the
apprehensions
which
the
girl
visit
to
waupegan
four
years
earlier
had
awakened
she
had
hoped
that
sylvia
long
absences
might
have
operated
to
diminish
owen
interest
and
she
had
managed
in
one
way
and
another
to
keep
them
apart
during
the
college
holidays
but
the
death
of
professor
kelton
had
evidently
thrown
sylvia
back
upon
owen
jealous
fears
danced
blackly
in
bassett
tired
brain
at
a
season
when
she
was
always
busiest
with
her
farms
owen
had
made
a
long
journey
to
see
sylvia
graduated
and
here
was
the
girl
established
on
the
most
intimate
terms
in
the
delaware
street
house
no
doubt
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
owen
did
not
lightly
or
often
change
her
plans
but
she
had
abandoned
her
project
of
spending
the
summer
at
the
lake
to
accommodate
herself
to
the
convenience
of
her
protégée
bassett
was
by
no
means
a
matter
of
illusion
she
was
not
well
and
her
sojourns
in
sanatoriums
had
served
to
alienate
her
in
a
measure
from
her
family
marian
had
grown
to
womanhood
without
realizing
her
mother
ideals
she
had
hoped
to
make
a
very
different
person
of
her
daughter
and
sylvia
reappearance
intensified
her
sense
of
defeat
even
in
the
retrospect
she
saw
no
reason
why
marian
might
not
have
pursued
the
course
that
sylvia
had
followed
in
her
confused
annoyances
and
agitations
she
was
bitter
not
only
against
marian
but
against
marian
father
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
take
a
stand
against
his
further
dallyings
in
politics
her
day
at
the
convention
hall
had
yielded
only
the
most
disagreeable
impressions
such
incidents
as
had
not
eluded
her
own
understanding
on
the
spot
had
been
freely
rendered
by
the
newspapers
it
was
all
sordid
and
gross
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
her
first
experience
of
politics
gained
in
her
girlhood
when
her
father
had
stood
high
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
winning
coveted
positions
without
the
support
of
such
allies
as
she
had
seen
cheering
her
husband
triumph
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
there
had
strayed
into
her
hands
an
envelope
of
newspaper
clippings
from
an
agency
that
wished
to
supply
her
as
its
circular
announced
it
supplied
the
wives
of
many
other
prominent
americans
with
newspaper
comments
on
their
husbands
as
a
bait
for
securing
a
client
these
examples
of
what
the
american
press
was
saying
of
morton
bassett
were
decidedly
the
stop
look
listen
editorial
had
suggested
to
many
influential
journals
a
of
bossism
with
the
imbroglio
as
text
it
was
disenchanting
to
find
one
husband
enrolled
in
a
list
of
political
reprobates
whose
activities
in
so
many
states
were
a
menace
to
public
safety
her
father
had
served
with
distinction
and
honor
this
same
commonwealth
that
her
husband
was
debasing
he
had
been
a
statesman
not
a
politician
not
a
boss
blackford
singleton
had
belonged
to
the
coterie
that
included
such
men
as
hoar
and
evarts
thurman
and
bayard
neither
her
imagination
nor
her
affection
could
bridge
the
chasm
that
separated
men
of
their
type
from
her
husband
who
in
middle
life
was
content
with
a
seat
in
the
state
legislature
and
busied
himself
with
wars
upon
petty
rivals
such
reflections
as
these
did
not
contribute
to
her
peace
of
mind
she
was
alone
in
her
room
at
owen
when
bassett
appeared
late
in
the
afternoon
owen
was
downtown
on
business
matters
marian
after
exhausting
all
her
devices
for
making
her
mother
comfortable
had
flown
in
search
of
acquaintances
and
sylvia
had
that
day
taken
up
her
work
in
the
normal
school
left
to
herself
for
the
greater
part
of
the
warm
afternoon
bassett
had
indulged
luxuriously
in
forebodings
she
had
not
expected
her
husband
and
his
unannounced
entrance
startled
her
well
she
remarked
drearily
so
you
have
come
back
to
face
it
have
you
i
undoubtedly
back
hallie
he
answered
with
an
effort
at
lightness
crossing
to
the
bedside
and
taking
her
hand
he
had
rarely
discussed
his
political
plans
with
her
but
he
realized
that
the
rupture
with
thatcher
must
naturally
have
distressed
her
and
there
was
also
thatcher
lawsuit
involving
her
aunt
which
had
disagreeable
possibilities
i
sorry
your
name
got
into
the
papers
hallie
i
did
want
you
to
go
to
the
convention
but
of
course
i
knew
you
went
to
please
marian
where
is
marian
oh
she
off
somewhere
i
could
expect
her
to
stay
here
in
this
hot
room
all
day
the
room
was
not
uncomfortable
but
it
seemed
wiser
not
to
debate
questions
of
temperature
he
found
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
her
you
must
worry
about
the
newspapers
hallie
they
always
make
the
worst
of
everything
the
temptation
to
distort
facts
to
make
a
good
story
is
strong
i
have
seen
it
in
my
connection
with
the
it
lamentable
but
you
ca
correct
it
in
a
day
i
pretty
well
hardened
to
it
myself
but
i
sorry
you
have
let
these
attacks
on
me
annoy
you
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
ignore
them
what
that
you
have
there
she
still
clasped
the
envelope
of
clippings
and
thrust
it
at
him
accusingly
the
calmness
of
his
inspection
irritated
her
and
she
broke
out
sharply
i
should
think
a
man
with
a
wife
and
family
would
lay
himself
open
to
such
attacks
in
all
the
newspapers
in
the
country
those
papers
call
you
another
such
political
boss
as
quay
and
gorman
there
nothing
they
do
say
about
you
well
hallie
they
been
saying
it
for
some
time
they
will
go
on
saying
it
probably
not
only
about
me
but
about
every
other
man
who
be
dictated
to
by
impractical
reformers
and
pharisaical
newspapers
but
i
must
confess
that
this
is
rather
hard
luck
he
held
up
two
of
the
cuttings
i
undertaken
to
do
just
what
papers
like
the
new
york
post
and
the
springfield
are
forever
begging
somebody
with
courage
to
do
i
been
trying
to
drive
a
rascal
out
of
politics
i
glad
of
this
chance
to
talk
to
you
about
thatcher
he
and
i
were
friends
for
years
as
you
know
i
never
understood
how
you
could
tolerate
that
man
he
so
coarse
and
vulgar
that
his
wife
stays
abroad
to
keep
her
daughters
away
from
him
well
that
not
my
affair
i
have
had
all
i
want
of
him
nothing
mysterious
about
my
breaking
with
him
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
he
a
bigger
man
in
this
state
than
i
am
i
have
known
for
several
years
that
he
intended
to
get
rid
of
me
as
soon
as
he
felt
he
could
do
it
safely
and
be
ready
to
capture
the
senatorship
when
he
saw
that
our
party
was
in
shape
to
win
again
i
always
distrusted
him
and
always
kept
an
eye
on
him
when
he
came
into
fraser
county
and
stooped
low
enough
to
buy
old
ike
pettit
i
thought
it
time
to
strike
you
read
a
lot
about
courage
in
politics
in
such
newspapers
as
these
that
have
been
philosophizing
about
me
at
long
range
well
i
not
going
to
brag
about
myself
but
it
required
some
courage
on
my
part
to
take
the
initiative
and
read
the
riot
act
to
thatcher
i
done
what
men
are
sometimes
praised
for
doing
but
i
do
want
praise
i
only
want
to
be
judged
fairly
i
always
avoided
bringing
business
or
politics
home
i
always
had
an
idea
that
when
a
man
goes
home
he
ought
to
close
the
door
on
everything
but
the
interests
the
home
has
for
him
i
may
have
been
wrong
about
that
and
i
very
sorry
that
you
have
been
troubled
sincerely
sorry
but
you
may
as
well
know
the
truth
now
which
is
that
thatcher
is
out
of
it
altogether
you
know
enough
of
him
to
understand
that
he
not
a
man
to
trust
with
power
and
i
done
the
state
and
my
party
a
service
in
turning
him
out
of
doors
he
had
spoken
quietly
and
earnestly
and
his
words
had
not
been
without
their
effect
he
had
never
been
harsh
with
her
or
the
children
his
manner
was
kind
and
considerate
he
had
to
an
extent
measurably
rehabilitated
himself
as
a
heroic
public
character
a
man
of
honor
and
a
husband
to
be
proud
of
but
she
had
not
spent
a
sleepless
night
and
a
gray
day
without
fortifying
herself
against
him
all
day
her
eyes
had
been
fixed
upon
an
abandoned
squirrel
box
in
the
crotch
of
an
elm
outside
her
window
it
had
become
the
repository
of
her
thoughts
the
habitation
of
her
sorrows
she
turned
her
head
slightly
so
that
her
eyes
might
rest
upon
this
tabernacle
of
fear
and
illusion
and
renewed
the
assault
refreshed
how
is
it
then
that
newspapers
away
off
in
new
york
and
massachusetts
speak
of
you
in
this
outrageous
fashion
they
so
far
away
that
it
seems
strange
they
speak
of
you
at
all
he
laughed
with
relief
feeling
that
the
question
marked
a
retreat
toward
weaker
fortifications
you
not
very
complimentary
are
you
hallie
they
must
think
me
of
some
importance
or
they
let
me
alone
i
would
subscribe
to
that
clipping
bureau
if
you
fear
we
too
much
in
the
limelight
i
been
taking
the
service
of
one
of
these
bureaus
for
several
years
and
i
read
every
line
the
papers
print
about
me
it
part
of
the
regular
routine
in
my
office
to
paste
them
in
scrapbooks
i
should
think
you
could
burn
them
fast
enough
what
if
the
children
should
see
them
some
day
well
you
may
be
surprised
to
know
that
they
not
all
so
bitter
once
in
a
long
while
i
get
a
kind
word
that
bill
i
got
through
the
assembly
separating
hardened
criminals
from
those
susceptible
of
reform
the
indeterminate
sentence
law
was
praised
by
penologists
all
over
the
country
it
all
in
the
day
work
sometimes
you
patted
on
the
back
and
the
next
time
they
kick
you
down
stairs
without
political
influence
you
have
no
chance
to
help
the
good
causes
or
defeat
the
bad
schemes
yes
i
suppose
that
is
true
she
murmured
weakly
he
had
successfully
met
and
turned
her
attack
and
the
worst
had
passed
but
he
expected
her
to
make
some
reference
to
thatcher
lawsuit
for
the
control
of
the
courier
and
he
was
not
disappointed
marian
who
had
a
genius
for
collecting
disagreeable
information
and
a
dramatic
instinct
for
using
it
effectively
had
apprised
her
of
it
this
hazarding
of
owen
favor
became
now
the
gravamen
of
his
offense
the
culmination
of
all
his
offenses
she
demanded
to
know
why
he
had
secretly
borrowed
money
of
her
aunt
when
from
the
time
of
their
marriage
it
had
been
understood
that
they
should
never
do
so
her
own
fortune
he
had
been
free
to
use
as
he
liked
she
demanded
to
know
why
he
had
not
taken
her
own
money
but
to
ask
financial
favors
of
aunt
sally
and
this
too
without
consultation
was
beyond
her
comprehension
she
was
on
secure
ground
here
he
had
always
shared
her
feeling
that
owen
required
cautious
handling
but
he
had
nevertheless
violated
their
compact
she
rushed
breathlessly
and
with
sobs
through
her
recital
and
you
have
seen
aunt
sally
since
you
have
made
no
effort
to
make
it
right
with
her
as
to
that
hallie
i
have
had
a
chance
to
see
her
she
only
been
home
two
days
and
i
been
away
myself
since
now
that
i
in
her
house
i
shall
explain
it
all
to
her
before
i
leave
but
you
have
explained
to
me
why
you
did
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
know
how
you
came
to
do
such
a
thing
well
then
the
fact
is
that
newspapers
these
days
are
not
cheap
and
the
cost
a
lot
of
money
i
been
pretty
well
tied
up
in
telephone
and
other
investments
of
late
and
i
have
never
taken
advantage
of
my
ownership
of
the
bassett
bank
to
use
its
money
except
within
my
reasonable
credit
as
it
would
be
estimated
by
any
one
else
your
own
funds
i
have
kept
invested
conservatively
in
securities
wholly
removed
from
speculative
influences
i
knew
that
if
i
did
get
the
newspaper
thatcher
would
so
i
made
every
possible
turn
to
go
in
with
him
i
was
fifty
thousand
dollars
shy
of
what
i
needed
to
pay
for
my
half
and
after
i
had
raked
up
all
the
money
i
could
safely
i
asked
aunt
sally
if
she
would
lend
me
that
sum
with
all
my
stock
as
security
fifty
thousand
dollars
morton
you
borrowed
that
much
money
of
her
her
satisfaction
in
learning
that
owen
commanded
so
large
a
sum
was
crushed
beneath
his
stupendous
error
in
having
gone
to
her
for
money
at
all
oh
she
did
lend
it
to
me
after
all
hallie
she
refused
to
do
so
but
she
allowed
me
to
buy
enough
shares
for
her
to
make
up
my
quota
thatcher
and
i
bought
at
eighty
cents
on
the
dollar
and
she
paid
the
same
she
has
her
shares
and
it
a
good
investment
and
she
knows
it
if
she
had
insisted
on
having
the
shares
in
her
own
name
thatcher
would
never
have
known
it
he
turned
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
she
was
keenly
alert
at
this
sign
of
discomfiture
and
not
above
taking
advantage
of
it
so
without
her
you
are
at
thatcher
mercy
are
you
i
have
spoken
to
her
about
this
and
she
has
said
anything
to
me
but
marian
with
her
usual
heedlessness
mentioned
it
and
it
was
clear
that
aunt
sally
was
very
angry
what
did
she
say
asked
bassett
anxiously
she
did
say
anything
but
she
shut
her
jaw
tight
and
changed
the
subject
it
was
what
she
did
say
you
better
think
well
before
you
broach
the
subject
to
her
i
been
thinking
about
it
if
i
take
her
stock
at
par
she
ought
to
be
satisfied
i
pay
more
if
it
necessary
and
of
course
i
make
every
effort
to
restore
good
feeling
i
think
i
understand
her
take
care
of
this
but
you
must
stay
out
of
it
and
tell
marian
to
keep
quiet
well
aunt
sally
and
thatcher
are
friends
he
rather
amuses
her
with
his
and
drinking
and
gambling
that
kind
of
thing
seem
so
bad
to
her
she
so
used
to
dealing
with
men
that
she
makes
allowances
for
them
then
he
said
quickly
with
a
smile
eager
to
escape
through
any
loophole
maybe
she
will
make
some
allowances
for
me
for
the
purpose
of
allaying
her
anger
we
assume
that
i
as
wicked
as
thatcher
well
she
answered
gathering
her
strength
for
a
final
assault
it
does
look
as
simple
as
that
to
me
your
first
mistake
was
in
getting
her
into
any
of
your
businesses
and
the
second
was
in
making
it
possible
for
thatcher
to
annoy
her
by
all
this
ugly
publicity
of
a
lawsuit
and
what
do
you
think
has
happened
on
top
of
all
this
girl
is
here
under
this
very
roof
that
girl
what
girl
his
opacity
incensed
her
she
had
been
brooding
over
her
aunt
renewed
interest
in
sylvia
garrison
all
day
and
his
dull
ignorance
was
the
last
straw
upon
nerves
screwed
to
the
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
drew
her
about
her
as
though
it
were
the
vesture
of
despair
that
garrison
girl
she
not
only
back
here
but
from
all
appearances
she
going
to
stay
aunt
sally
infatuated
with
her
when
the
grandfather
died
aunt
sally
did
everything
for
her
went
over
to
montgomery
to
take
charge
of
the
funeral
and
then
went
back
to
wellesley
to
see
the
girl
graduate
and
now
she
giving
up
her
plan
of
going
to
waupegan
for
the
summer
to
stay
here
in
all
the
heat
with
a
girl
who
has
the
slightest
claim
on
her
when
the
keltons
visited
waupegan
four
years
ago
i
saw
this
coming
i
wanted
marian
to
go
to
college
and
tried
to
get
you
interested
in
the
plan
because
that
was
what
first
caught
aunt
sally
fancy
sylvia
cleverness
and
this
college
idea
but
you
would
do
anything
about
marian
and
now
thrown
away
her
chances
and
here
this
stranger
graduating
with
honors
and
aunt
sally
going
down
there
to
see
it
aunt
sally
going
to
make
a
companion
of
her
and
you
ca
tell
what
will
happen
i
like
to
know
what
you
can
say
to
your
children
when
all
aunt
sally
money
that
should
rightly
go
to
them
goes
to
a
girl
she
picked
up
out
of
nowhere
this
is
what
your
politics
has
got
us
into
morton
bassett
the
soberness
to
which
this
brought
him
at
last
satisfied
her
she
had
freely
expressed
the
anxiety
caused
by
sylvia
first
appearance
on
the
domestic
horizon
but
for
a
year
or
two
in
his
wife
absences
in
pursuit
of
health
he
had
heard
little
of
her
apprehensions
own
disinclination
for
a
college
career
had
from
the
beginning
seemed
to
him
to
interpose
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
parental
guidance
in
that
direction
his
wife
attitude
in
these
new
circumstances
of
the
return
of
her
aunt
protégée
struck
him
as
wholly
unjustified
and
unreasonable
you
not
quite
yourself
when
you
talk
that
way
hallie
professor
kelton
was
one
of
aunt
sally
oldest
friends
old
people
have
a
habit
of
going
back
to
the
friends
of
their
youth
there
nothing
strange
in
it
and
this
being
true
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
for
aunt
sally
to
help
the
girl
in
her
trouble
even
to
the
extent
of
seeing
her
graduated
it
was
just
like
aunt
sally
he
continued
warming
to
his
subject
who
one
of
the
stanchest
friends
anybody
could
have
aunt
sally
devoted
to
you
and
your
children
it
ungenerous
to
her
to
assume
that
a
young
woman
she
hardly
knows
is
supplanting
you
or
marian
this
newspaper
notoriety
i
getting
has
troubled
you
and
i
sorry
for
it
but
i
ca
let
you
entertain
this
delusion
that
your
kindness
to
the
granddaughter
of
one
of
her
old
friends
means
that
aunt
sally
has
ceased
to
care
for
you
or
lost
her
regard
for
marian
and
blackford
if
you
think
of
it
seriously
for
a
moment
you
see
how
foolish
it
is
to
harbor
any
jealousy
of
miss
garrison
come
cheer
up
and
forget
it
if
aunt
sally
got
an
inkling
of
this
you
may
be
sure
that
displease
her
you
say
the
girl
is
here
in
the
house
she
not
only
here
but
she
here
to
stay
she
going
to
intrench
herself
here
she
sent
him
to
the
chiffonier
to
find
a
fresh
handkerchief
he
watched
her
helplessly
for
a
moment
as
she
dried
her
eyes
then
he
took
her
hands
and
bent
over
her
wo
you
try
to
see
things
a
little
brighter
it
all
just
because
you
got
too
tired
yesterday
you
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
convention
and
i
did
know
you
were
going
or
i
should
have
forbidden
it
well
marian
wanted
to
go
and
we
were
coming
to
town
anyhow
and
besides
aunt
sally
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
go
too
she
wanted
this
garrison
girl
to
see
a
political
convention
i
suppose
that
was
the
real
reason
he
laughed
gazing
down
into
her
tearful
face
in
which
resentment
lingered
waveringly
as
in
the
faces
of
children
persuaded
against
their
will
and
parting
reluctantly
with
the
solace
of
tears
you
must
get
up
for
dinner
hallie
your
doctors
have
always
insisted
that
you
needed
variety
and
change
and
we
take
you
up
to
the
lake
out
of
this
heat
we
have
a
good
deal
to
be
grateful
for
after
all
hallie
you
have
any
right
to
feel
disappointed
in
marian
the
nicest
girl
in
the
state
and
the
prettiest
girl
you
find
anywhere
we
ought
to
be
glad
she
so
and
handsome
and
clever
college
never
was
for
her
she
certainly
was
never
for
college
i
talked
that
over
with
miss
waring
a
number
of
times
and
i
believe
aunt
sally
thinks
less
of
marian
because
she
is
a
better
scholar
only
a
small
per
cent
of
women
go
to
college
and
i
not
sure
it
a
good
thing
i
even
a
little
doubtful
about
sending
blackford
to
college
this
education
business
is
overdone
and
the
sooner
a
boy
gets
into
harness
the
better
her
deep
sigh
implied
that
he
might
do
as
he
liked
with
his
son
now
that
she
had
so
completely
failed
with
her
daughter
aunt
sally
is
very
much
interested
in
harwood
she
has
put
affairs
in
his
hands
could
it
be
possible
he
groped
for
her
unexpressed
meaning
and
seeing
that
he
had
not
grasped
it
she
clarified
it
to
his
masculine
intelligence
if
there
are
two
persons
she
is
interested
in
and
they
understand
each
other
it
all
so
much
more
formidable
and
then
seeing
that
this
also
was
too
subtle
she
put
it
flatly
what
if
harwood
should
marry
sylvia
well
that
borrowing
trouble
he
cried
impatiently
aunt
sally
is
interested
in
a
great
many
young
people
she
is
very
fond
of
allen
thatcher
and
allen
seems
to
find
marian
society
agreeable
more
so
i
fancy
than
harwood
does
why
not
speculate
along
that
line
it
as
plausible
as
the
other
oh
that
boy
that
something
we
must
guard
against
morton
that
is
quite
impossible
i
dare
say
it
is
he
replied
but
not
more
unlikely
than
that
harwood
will
marry
this
sylvia
who
worries
you
so
unnecessarily
marian
is
going
to
marry
somebody
some
day
and
that
on
my
mind
a
great
deal
you
have
got
to
give
more
thought
to
family
matters
right
for
marian
to
marry
and
i
think
a
girl
of
her
tastes
should
settle
early
but
we
must
guard
her
from
mistakes
i
had
that
on
my
conscience
several
years
of
course
hallie
and
i
not
been
unmindful
of
it
and
if
aunt
sally
is
interested
in
young
harwood
and
you
think
well
of
him
yourself
but
of
course
i
do
favor
him
for
marian
i
should
like
marian
to
marry
into
a
family
of
some
standing
well
we
see
to
it
that
she
does
we
want
our
daughter
to
be
happy
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
for
our
children
he
concluded
largely
she
promised
to
appear
at
the
dinner
table
and
he
went
down
with
some
idea
of
seeing
owen
at
once
to
assure
her
of
his
honorable
intentions
toward
her
in
the
courier
matter
he
wanted
to
relieve
his
own
fears
as
well
as
his
wife
as
to
the
mischief
that
had
been
wrought
by
thatcher
suit
in
the
hall
below
he
met
sylvia
just
back
from
her
first
day
at
the
normal
school
the
maid
had
admitted
her
and
she
was
slipping
her
parasol
into
the
rack
as
he
came
downstairs
she
heard
his
step
and
turned
toward
him
a
slender
dark
young
woman
in
black
in
the
dim
hall
she
did
not
at
once
recognize
him
and
he
spoke
first
miss
garrison
i
am
bassett
i
believe
i
introduced
myself
to
you
at
waupegan
and
that
seems
a
long
time
ago
i
remember
very
well
bassett
sylvia
replied
and
they
shook
hands
you
found
me
in
my
dream
corner
by
the
lake
and
walked
to
owen
with
me
i
remember
our
meeting
perfectly
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
newel
regarding
her
intently
she
was
entirely
at
ease
a
young
woman
without
awkwardness
or
embarrassment
she
had
disposed
of
their
previous
meeting
lightly
as
though
such
fortuitous
incidents
had
not
been
lacking
in
her
life
her
mourning
hat
cast
a
shadow
upon
her
face
but
he
had
been
conscious
of
the
friendliness
of
her
smile
her
dark
eyes
had
inspected
him
swiftly
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
a
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
impress
her
favorably
the
maid
said
owen
and
marian
are
still
out
i
hope
bassett
is
better
i
wonder
if
i
can
do
anything
for
her
no
thank
you
she
quite
comfortable
and
will
be
down
for
dinner
i
glad
to
hear
that
suppose
we
find
seats
here
she
walked
before
him
into
the
parlor
and
threw
back
the
curtains
the
better
to
admit
the
air
he
watched
her
attentively
noting
the
ease
and
grace
of
her
movements
and
took
the
chair
she
indicated
it
very
nice
to
see
bassett
and
marian
again
they
were
so
good
to
me
that
summer
at
waupegan
i
have
carried
the
pleasantest
memories
of
that
visit
ever
since
it
seems
a
long
time
ago
and
it
is
nearly
four
years
is
it
four
this
summer
i
think
i
remember
because
i
had
been
to
colorado
and
that
whole
year
was
pretty
full
for
me
but
all
these
years
have
been
busy
ones
for
you
too
i
hear
your
grandfather
death
must
have
been
a
great
shock
to
you
i
knew
him
only
by
reputation
but
it
was
a
reputation
to
be
proud
of
yes
grandfather
kelton
had
been
everything
to
me
it
was
too
bad
he
could
have
lived
to
see
you
through
college
he
must
have
taken
a
great
interest
in
your
work
there
through
his
own
training
and
scholarship
it
was
what
he
wanted
me
to
do
and
i
wish
he
could
have
known
how
i
value
it
he
was
the
best
of
men
the
kindest
and
noblest
and
he
was
a
wonderful
scholar
he
had
the
habit
of
thoroughness
that
i
suppose
was
partly
due
to
the
discipline
of
the
navy
i
fancy
that
a
man
trained
in
habits
of
exactness
gets
into
the
way
of
keeping
his
mind
no
loose
ends
around
anywhere
she
smiled
at
this
and
regarded
him
with
rather
more
attention
as
though
his
remark
had
given
her
a
new
impression
of
him
which
her
eyes
wished
to
verify
they
tell
me
you
expect
to
teach
in
the
city
schools
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
hardest
kind
of
work
i
should
think
you
would
prefer
a
college
position
there
would
be
less
drudgery
and
better
social
opportunities
every
one
warns
me
that
it
hard
work
but
i
do
believe
it
can
be
so
terrible
somebody
has
to
do
it
of
course
college
positions
are
more
dignified
and
likely
to
be
better
paid
he
started
to
speak
and
hesitated
well
she
laughed
you
were
going
to
add
your
warning
were
you
i
used
to
them
no
nothing
of
the
sort
i
was
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
if
you
cared
to
have
me
i
should
be
glad
to
see
whether
our
state
university
might
not
have
something
for
you
i
have
friends
and
acquaintances
who
could
help
there
oh
you
are
very
kind
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
offer
to
do
that
but
a
slight
embarrassment
was
manifest
in
the
quick
opening
and
closing
of
her
eyes
a
slight
turning
of
the
head
but
she
smiled
pleasantly
happily
he
liked
her
way
of
smiling
and
smiled
himself
he
found
it
agreeable
to
be
talking
to
this
young
woman
with
the
fine
candid
eyes
whose
manner
was
so
assured
without
assurance
she
smoothed
the
black
gloves
in
her
lap
quietly
they
were
capable
hands
her
whole
appearance
and
manner
somehow
betokened
competence
the
fact
is
bassett
that
i
have
declined
one
or
two
college
positions
my
own
college
offered
to
take
me
in
and
i
believe
there
were
one
or
two
other
chances
but
it
is
kind
of
you
to
offer
to
help
me
she
had
minimized
the
importance
of
the
offers
she
had
declined
so
that
he
might
not
feel
the
meagreness
of
his
proffered
help
and
he
liked
her
way
of
doing
it
but
it
was
incredible
that
a
young
woman
should
decline
an
advantageous
and
promising
position
to
accept
a
minor
one
in
the
world
he
knew
there
were
many
hands
on
all
the
rounds
of
all
the
available
ladders
of
course
he
hastened
to
say
i
knew
you
were
efficient
that
why
i
thought
the
public
schools
were
not
quite
not
quite
worthy
of
your
talents
some
explanation
seemed
necessary
and
sylvia
hesitated
for
a
moment
do
i
really
have
to
be
serious
bassett
so
many
people
the
girls
at
college
and
some
of
my
instructors
and
owen
even
have
assured
me
that
i
am
not
quite
right
in
my
mind
but
i
will
make
short
work
of
my
reasons
please
believe
that
i
really
do
mean
to
take
myself
too
seriously
i
want
to
teach
in
the
public
schools
merely
to
continue
my
education
there
are
things
to
learn
there
that
i
want
to
know
so
you
see
after
all
it
neither
important
nor
interesting
it
only
only
my
woman
insatiable
curiosity
he
smiled
but
he
frowned
too
it
annoyed
him
not
to
comprehend
her
could
only
be
a
matter
of
necessity
her
plea
of
curiosity
must
cover
something
deeper
that
she
withheld
i
know
she
continued
if
i
may
say
it
ever
so
much
from
books
but
i
have
only
the
faintest
notions
of
life
now
is
that
terribly
muggy
people
and
their
conditions
and
circumstances
can
only
be
learned
by
going
to
the
original
sources
this
was
not
illuminative
she
had
only
added
to
his
befuddlement
and
he
bent
forward
soliciting
some
more
lucid
statement
of
her
position
i
had
hoped
to
go
ahead
and
never
have
to
explain
for
i
fear
that
in
explaining
i
seem
to
be
appraising
myself
too
high
but
you
believe
that
of
me
will
you
if
i
took
one
of
these
college
positions
and
proved
efficient
and
had
good
luck
i
should
keep
on
knowing
all
the
rest
of
my
life
about
the
same
sort
of
people
for
the
girls
who
go
to
college
are
from
the
more
fortunate
classes
there
are
exceptions
but
they
are
drawn
largely
from
homes
that
have
some
cultivation
some
sort
of
background
the
experiences
of
teachers
in
such
institutions
are
likely
to
cramp
it
all
right
later
on
but
at
first
it
seems
to
me
better
to
experiment
in
the
wider
circle
now
and
she
broke
off
with
a
light
laugh
eager
that
he
should
understand
it
not
then
your
own
advantage
you
consult
the
appeals
to
you
it
rather
like
like
a
nun
vocation
you
think
the
service
is
higher
oh
it
would
be
if
i
could
render
service
please
do
think
i
feel
that
the
world
is
waiting
for
me
to
set
it
right
i
do
believe
so
wrong
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
do
understand
a
lot
of
things
and
that
the
knowledge
i
lack
is
something
we
can
dig
out
of
a
library
but
that
we
must
go
to
life
for
it
there
a
good
deal
to
learn
in
a
city
like
this
that
still
in
the
making
i
might
have
gone
to
new
york
but
there
are
too
many
elements
there
it
all
too
big
for
me
here
you
can
see
nearly
as
many
kinds
of
people
and
you
can
get
closer
to
them
you
can
see
how
they
earn
their
living
and
you
can
even
follow
them
to
church
on
sunday
and
see
what
they
get
out
of
that
i
afraid
he
replied
after
deliberating
a
moment
that
you
are
going
to
make
yourself
uncomfortable
you
are
cutting
out
a
programme
of
unhappiness
why
should
i
make
myself
uncomfortable
for
a
little
while
i
have
never
known
anything
but
comfort
but
that
your
blessing
no
matter
how
much
you
want
to
do
it
you
ca
remove
all
the
unhappiness
in
the
world
not
even
by
dividing
with
the
less
fortunate
i
never
been
able
to
follow
that
philosophy
maybe
she
said
you
have
never
tried
it
she
was
seeking
neither
to
convince
him
nor
to
accomplish
his
discomfiture
and
to
this
end
was
maintaining
her
share
of
the
dialogue
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
smile
of
amity
maybe
i
never
have
he
replied
slowly
i
did
have
your
advantage
of
seeing
a
place
to
begin
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
every
one
you
have
the
thing
that
i
can
never
hope
to
have
that
i
do
ask
for
you
have
the
power
in
your
hands
to
do
everything
his
quick
direct
glance
expressed
curiosity
as
to
whether
she
were
appealing
to
his
vanity
or
implying
a
sincere
belief
in
his
power
power
is
too
large
a
word
to
apply
to
me
miss
garrison
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
politics
and
in
politics
you
ca
do
all
you
like
i
did
question
that
men
of
the
finest
intentions
seem
to
fail
and
they
will
probably
go
on
failing
i
know
that
from
books
you
know
it
of
course
from
actual
dealings
with
the
men
who
find
their
way
to
responsible
places
and
who
very
often
fail
to
accomplish
the
things
we
expect
of
them
the
aims
of
most
of
the
reformers
are
futile
from
the
beginning
legislatures
can
pass
laws
they
pass
far
too
many
but
they
ca
make
ideal
conditions
out
of
those
laws
i
seen
it
tried
yesterday
when
you
were
able
to
make
that
convention
do
exactly
what
you
wanted
it
to
without
even
being
there
to
watch
it
it
must
have
been
because
of
some
ideal
you
were
working
for
you
thought
you
were
serving
some
good
purpose
it
was
just
spite
or
to
show
your
power
it
could
have
been
that
i
did
it
he
said
doggedly
as
though
to
destroy
with
a
single
blunt
thrust
her
tower
of
illusions
i
did
it
to
smash
a
man
named
thatcher
there
was
any
ideal
nonsense
about
it
he
frowned
surprised
and
displeased
that
he
had
spoken
so
roughly
he
rarely
let
go
of
himself
in
that
fashion
he
expected
her
to
take
advantage
of
his
admission
to
point
a
moral
but
she
said
instantly
then
you
did
it
beautifully
there
was
a
certain
perfection
about
it
it
was
oh
immensely
funny
she
laughed
tossing
her
head
lightly
a
laugh
of
real
enjoyment
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
laughing
with
her
it
seemed
that
the
thatcher
incident
was
not
only
funny
but
that
its
full
humorous
value
had
not
until
that
moment
been
wholly
realized
by
either
of
them
she
rose
quickly
one
of
her
gloves
fell
to
the
floor
and
he
picked
it
up
the
act
of
restoring
it
brought
them
close
together
and
their
talk
had
he
felt
justified
another
searching
glance
into
her
face
she
nodded
her
thanks
smiling
again
and
moved
toward
the
door
he
admired
the
tact
which
had
caused
her
to
close
the
discussion
at
precisely
the
safe
moment
he
was
a
master
of
the
art
of
closing
interviews
and
she
had
placed
the
period
at
the
end
of
the
right
sentence
it
was
where
he
would
have
placed
it
himself
she
had
laughed
and
the
novelty
of
being
laughed
at
was
refreshing
he
and
thatcher
had
laughed
in
secret
at
the
confusion
of
their
common
enemies
in
old
times
but
most
men
feared
him
and
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
mirthless
person
he
had
rarely
discussed
politics
with
women
he
had
an
idea
that
a
woman
politics
when
she
had
any
partook
of
the
nature
of
her
religion
and
that
it
was
something
quite
emotional
tending
toward
hysteria
he
experienced
a
sense
of
guilt
at
the
relief
he
found
in
sylvia
laughter
remembering
that
scarcely
half
an
hour
earlier
he
had
been
at
pains
to
justify
himself
before
his
wife
for
the
very
act
which
had
struck
this
girl
as
funny
he
had
met
bassett
accusations
with
evasion
and
dissimulation
and
he
had
accomplished
an
escape
that
was
not
in
retrospect
wholly
creditable
he
hated
scenes
and
tiresome
debates
as
he
hated
people
who
cringed
and
sidled
before
him
his
manner
of
dealing
with
thatcher
had
been
born
of
a
diabolical
humor
which
he
rarely
exercised
but
which
afforded
him
a
delicious
satisfaction
it
was
the
sort
of
revenge
one
reserved
for
a
foe
capable
of
appreciating
its
humor
and
malignity
the
answer
of
laughter
was
one
to
which
he
was
unused
and
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
it
had
effected
an
understanding
of
some
vague
and
intangible
kind
between
him
and
sylvia
garrison
she
might
not
approve
of
him
he
had
no
idea
that
she
did
but
she
had
struck
a
chord
whose
vibrations
pleased
and
tantalized
she
was
provocative
and
to
a
degree
mystifying
and
the
abrupt
termination
of
their
talk
seemed
to
leave
the
way
open
to
other
interviews
he
thought
of
many
things
he
might
have
said
to
her
at
the
moment
but
her
period
was
not
to
be
changed
to
comma
or
semicolon
she
was
satisfied
with
the
punctuation
and
had
so
to
speak
run
away
with
the
pencil
she
had
tossed
his
political
aims
and
strifes
into
the
air
with
a
bewildering
dismissal
and
he
stood
like
a
child
whose
toy
balloon
has
slipped
away
at
its
flight
its
loss
she
picked
up
some
books
she
had
left
on
a
stand
in
the
hall
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
her
ascent
hearing
the
swish
of
her
skirts
on
the
stairs
but
she
did
not
look
back
she
was
humming
softly
to
herself
as
she
passed
out
of
sight
chapter
xxi
a
short
horse
soon
curried
sylvia
sat
beside
bassett
at
dinner
that
night
and
it
was
on
the
whole
a
cheerful
party
bassett
was
restored
to
tranquillity
and
before
her
aunt
she
always
strove
to
hide
her
ills
from
a
feeling
that
that
lady
who
enjoyed
perfect
health
and
carried
on
the
most
prodigious
undertakings
had
little
patience
with
her
less
fortunate
sisters
whom
the
doctors
never
fully
discharge
owen
had
returned
so
late
that
bassett
was
unable
to
dispose
of
the
lawsuit
before
dinner
she
had
greeted
her
niece
husband
with
her
usual
cordiality
she
always
called
him
morton
and
she
was
aunt
sally
to
him
as
to
many
hundreds
of
her
fellow
citizens
she
discussed
crops
markets
rumors
of
foreign
wars
prospective
changes
in
the
president
cabinet
the
price
of
ice
and
the
automobile
invasion
talk
at
sally
owen
table
was
always
likely
to
be
spirited
bassett
anxiety
as
to
his
relations
with
her
passed
he
had
never
felt
more
comfortable
in
her
house
only
the
most
temerarious
ever
ventured
to
ask
a
forecast
of
plans
marian
who
had
found
a
school
friend
with
an
automobile
and
had
enjoyed
a
run
into
the
country
did
not
share
the
common
fear
of
her
owen
liked
marian
straightforward
ways
even
when
they
approached
rashness
it
had
occurred
to
her
sometimes
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
singleton
in
marian
she
sally
owen
was
a
singleton
herself
and
admired
the
traits
of
that
side
of
her
family
marian
amused
her
now
by
plunging
into
a
description
of
a
new
flat
she
had
passed
that
afternoon
which
would
provide
admirably
a
winter
home
for
the
bassetts
bassett
shuddered
expecting
her
aunt
to
sound
a
warning
against
the
extravagance
of
maintaining
two
homes
but
owen
rallied
promptly
to
her
grandniece
support
if
you
got
tired
of
my
house
you
could
do
better
than
to
take
an
apartment
in
the
verona
i
saw
the
plans
before
they
began
it
and
and
my
house
is
open
to
you
and
always
has
been
but
i
notice
you
go
to
the
hotel
about
half
the
time
you
better
try
a
flat
for
a
winter
hallie
and
let
marian
see
how
we
do
things
in
town
instantly
bassett
was
alert
this
could
only
be
covert
notice
that
sylvia
was
to
be
installed
in
the
delaware
street
house
marian
was
engaging
her
father
in
debate
upon
the
merits
of
her
plan
fortified
by
owen
unexpected
approval
bassett
raised
her
eyes
to
sylvia
sylvia
in
one
of
the
white
gowns
with
which
she
relieved
her
mourning
tranquilly
unconscious
of
the
dark
terror
she
awakened
in
bassett
seemed
to
be
sympathetically
interested
in
the
bassetts
transfer
to
the
capital
sylvia
was
guilty
of
the
deplorable
sin
of
making
herself
agreeable
to
every
one
she
had
paused
on
the
way
to
her
room
before
dinner
to
proffer
assistance
to
bassett
with
a
light
soothing
touch
she
had
brushed
the
invalid
hair
and
dressed
it
and
she
had
produced
a
new
kind
of
salts
that
proved
delightfully
refreshing
since
coming
to
the
table
bassett
had
several
times
detected
her
husband
in
an
exchange
of
smiles
with
the
young
woman
and
marian
and
the
usurper
got
on
famously
bassett
had
observed
that
sylvia
appetite
was
excellent
and
this
had
weakened
her
belief
in
the
girl
genius
there
was
a
good
deal
of
superstition
touching
women
in
hallie
bassett
but
owen
was
speaking
i
suppose
i
see
less
of
you
all
if
you
moved
to
town
marian
used
to
run
off
from
miss
waring
to
cheer
me
up
mostly
when
her
lessons
were
bad
was
it
marian
i
love
this
house
aunt
sally
but
you
ca
have
us
all
on
your
hands
all
the
time
well
owen
remarked
glancing
round
the
table
quizzically
i
might
do
worse
but
even
sylvia
scorns
me
she
going
to
move
out
bassett
with
difficulty
concealed
her
immeasurable
relief
owen
left
explanations
to
sylvia
who
promptly
supplied
them
that
sounds
as
though
i
were
about
to
take
leave
without
settling
my
bill
does
it
but
i
thought
it
wise
not
to
let
it
get
too
big
going
to
move
to
elizabeth
house
elizabeth
house
why
sylvia
cried
marian
bassett
smothered
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
if
aunt
sally
was
transferring
her
protégée
to
the
home
she
had
established
for
working
girls
and
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
removal
could
be
upon
own
initiative
the
bassett
prospects
brightened
at
once
aunt
sally
was
in
her
way
an
aristocrat
she
was
rich
and
her
eccentricities
were
due
largely
to
her
kindness
of
heart
but
bassett
was
satisfied
now
that
she
was
not
a
woman
to
harbor
in
her
home
a
girl
who
labored
in
a
public
not
only
did
bassett
confidence
in
her
aunt
rise
but
she
felt
a
thrill
of
admiration
for
sylvia
who
was
unmistakably
a
girl
who
knew
her
place
and
her
place
as
a
was
not
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
richest
women
in
the
state
but
in
a
house
provided
through
that
lady
beneficence
for
the
shelter
of
young
women
occupied
in
earning
a
livelihood
it
very
nice
there
sylvia
was
saying
i
stopped
on
my
way
home
this
afternoon
and
found
that
they
could
give
me
a
room
it
all
arranged
but
it
only
for
office
girls
and
department
store
clerks
and
dressmakers
sylvia
i
should
think
you
would
hate
it
why
my
manicure
lives
there
marian
desisted
warned
by
her
mother
who
wished
no
jarring
note
to
mar
her
satisfaction
in
the
situation
that
manicure
girl
is
a
circus
said
owen
quite
oblivious
of
the
undercurrent
of
her
niece
thoughts
when
they
had
a
vaudeville
show
last
winter
she
did
the
best
stunts
of
any
of
you
did
mention
those
jewesses
that
i
had
such
a
row
to
get
in
smart
girls
one
of
is
the
fastest
typewriter
in
town
she
a
credit
to
jerusalem
that
girl
and
a
born
banker
they
started
a
savings
club
and
miriam
runs
it
they
wo
lose
any
money
owen
chuckled
and
the
rest
laughed
there
was
no
question
of
owen
pride
in
elizabeth
house
did
you
see
any
plumbers
around
the
place
she
demanded
of
sylvia
i
been
a
month
trying
to
get
another
bathroom
put
in
on
the
third
floor
and
plumbers
do
try
the
soul
that
all
done
replied
sylvia
the
matron
told
me
to
tell
you
so
i
about
due
to
go
over
there
and
look
over
the
linen
remarked
owen
with
an
air
of
making
a
memorandum
of
a
duty
neglected
well
i
guess
it
comfortable
enough
said
marian
but
i
should
think
you
could
do
better
than
that
sylvia
you
have
to
eat
at
the
same
table
with
some
typewriter
pounder
with
all
your
education
i
should
think
it
would
bore
you
sylvia
will
have
to
learn
about
it
for
herself
marian
said
bassett
i
always
understood
that
the
executive
board
is
very
careful
not
to
admit
girls
whose
character
is
above
reproach
owen
turned
the
key
of
her
coffee
urn
sharply
upon
the
cup
she
was
filling
and
looked
her
niece
in
the
eye
oh
we
careful
hallie
we
careful
but
i
tell
not
to
be
careful
well
of
course
the
aim
is
to
protect
girls
bassett
replied
conscious
of
a
disconcerting
acidity
in
her
aunt
remark
i
not
afraid
of
contamination
observed
sylvia
of
course
not
rejoined
bassett
hastily
i
think
fine
that
with
your
culture
you
will
go
and
live
in
such
a
place
it
shows
a
beautiful
spirit
of
oh
please
do
say
that
i
going
there
just
because
i
want
to
go
and
then
smiling
to
ease
the
moment
tension
i
expect
to
have
the
best
of
times
at
elizabeth
house
sylvia
remarked
owen
drawling
the
name
a
trifle
more
than
usual
sylvia
can
do
what
she
pleases
anywhere
i
think
said
bassett
who
had
not
before
entered
into
the
discussion
that
aunt
sally
has
struck
the
right
word
there
in
these
days
a
girl
can
do
as
she
likes
and
we
have
any
business
to
discuss
miss
garrison
right
to
live
at
elizabeth
house
of
course
sylvia
we
did
mean
to
seem
to
criticize
you
you
know
that
said
bassett
flushing
you
are
my
friends
said
sylvia
glancing
round
the
table
and
if
there
criticizing
to
be
done
you
have
the
first
right
if
sylvia
is
to
be
criticized
and
i
do
understand
that
any
one
has
tried
it
remarked
owen
i
want
the
first
chance
at
her
myself
and
with
the
snapping
of
her
spectacle
case
they
rose
from
the
table
they
had
barely
settled
themselves
in
the
parlor
when
harwood
and
allen
arrived
in
allen
motor
dan
had
expected
his
friend
to
resent
his
part
in
the
convention
and
he
had
sought
allen
at
lüders
shop
to
satisfy
himself
that
their
personal
relations
had
not
been
disturbed
he
had
found
allen
at
the
end
of
a
day
work
perched
upon
a
bench
discoursing
to
the
workmen
on
the
great
experiment
allen
had
it
seemed
watched
the
convention
from
an
obscure
corner
of
the
gallery
he
pronounced
dan
speech
immense
perfectly
bully
he
was
extravagant
in
his
praise
of
it
his
father
success
in
naming
the
ticket
had
seemed
to
him
a
great
triumph
allen
viewed
the
whole
matter
with
a
kind
of
detachment
as
a
spectator
whose
interest
is
wholly
impersonal
he
thought
there
would
be
a
great
fight
between
the
combatants
his
dad
had
finished
yet
he
declared
sententiously
the
incidents
of
the
convention
had
convinced
him
that
the
great
experiment
was
progressing
according
to
some
predestined
formula
he
and
harwood
had
dined
together
at
the
university
club
and
he
was
quite
in
the
humor
to
call
on
the
bassetts
at
owen
and
the
coming
of
sylvia
as
to
whom
owen
had
piqued
his
curiosity
was
not
to
be
overlooked
he
cleared
the
air
by
brushing
away
the
convention
with
a
word
addressed
daringly
to
bassett
papa
come
back
from
fishing
papa
is
digging
bait
and
they
all
laughed
miss
garrison
you
must
be
the
greatest
of
girls
for
you
have
my
own
ideas
our
invincible
young
orator
here
has
been
telling
me
so
that
was
a
grand
speech
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
was
greeting
to
dan
you
certainly
have
a
great
voice
daniel
remarked
owen
and
you
had
your
nerve
with
you
you
were
effective
from
the
first
moment
harwood
you
ought
to
consider
going
on
the
lecture
platform
said
bassett
oh
dan
has
come
to
that
yet
its
only
defeated
statesmen
who
spout
in
the
chautauquas
bassett
remarked
harwood
was
in
fine
fettle
many
men
had
expressed
their
approval
of
him
at
the
club
he
had
enjoyed
the
chaffing
of
the
young
gentlemen
with
whom
he
ate
luncheon
daily
and
whose
tolerance
of
the
universe
was
tinged
with
a
certain
cynicism
they
liked
harwood
they
knew
he
was
a
smart
fellow
and
because
they
liked
and
admired
him
they
rallied
him
freely
the
president
of
a
manufacturing
company
had
called
at
the
boordman
building
to
retain
him
in
a
damage
suit
a
tribute
to
his
growing
fame
dan
was
a
victim
of
that
error
to
which
young
men
yield
in
exultant
moments
when
after
a
first
brush
with
the
pickets
they
are
confident
of
making
their
own
terms
with
life
dan
attitude
toward
the
world
was
receptive
here
in
the
bassett
domestic
circle
he
felt
no
shame
at
being
a
bassett
man
all
but
sylvia
had
spoken
to
him
of
his
part
in
the
convention
and
she
turned
to
him
now
after
a
passage
with
allen
that
had
left
the
young
man
radiant
you
have
a
devoted
admirer
in
thatcher
he
must
be
a
difficult
friend
to
satisfy
said
sylvia
then
do
you
think
i
do
satisfy
him
oh
perfectly
he
a
combination
of
optimist
and
fatalist
i
judge
he
thinks
nothing
matters
much
for
everything
is
coming
out
all
right
in
the
end
then
where
do
you
place
me
in
his
scheme
of
things
that
depends
does
it
she
replied
carelessly
on
whether
you
are
the
master
of
the
ship
or
only
a
prisoner
under
the
hatches
he
reddened
and
she
added
nothing
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
you
think
then
and
he
stopped
uneasy
under
her
gaze
some
of
the
time
i
do
think
i
just
wonder
and
that
very
different
is
it
he
realized
now
how
much
he
had
counted
on
the
kind
things
he
had
expected
her
to
say
he
had
plainly
lost
ground
with
her
since
their
talk
on
the
madison
campus
and
he
wanted
to
justify
himself
to
convince
her
of
his
rectitude
and
of
her
failure
to
understand
his
part
in
the
convention
but
the
time
and
place
were
unpropitious
allen
was
calling
attention
to
the
moonlight
and
proposing
an
automobile
flight
into
the
country
his
car
would
hold
them
all
and
he
announced
himself
the
safest
of
chauffeurs
owen
declined
on
the
double
plea
that
she
had
business
to
attend
to
and
did
not
ride
in
motor
cars
even
to
please
allen
thatcher
bassett
also
excused
himself
so
the
rest
set
off
presently
under
bassett
chaperonage
are
you
going
downtown
morton
asked
owen
as
they
watched
the
motor
roll
away
no
i
like
to
see
you
on
a
business
matter
aunt
sally
if
you
can
give
me
a
few
minutes
certainly
morton
come
right
in
she
flashed
on
the
lights
in
her
office
where
thomas
hendricks
still
gazed
benevolently
at
maud
breaking
her
record
i
owe
you
an
apology
aunt
sally
bassett
began
at
once
i
sorry
i
got
you
into
a
lawsuit
but
things
moved
so
fast
that
i
did
have
a
chance
to
pull
you
out
of
the
way
thatcher
and
i
have
agreed
to
disagree
as
you
doubtless
know
owen
drew
her
spectacle
case
from
her
pocket
there
were
pockets
and
deep
ones
in
all
her
gowns
wiped
her
glasses
and
put
them
on
you
and
edward
do
seem
to
be
having
a
little
trouble
when
i
got
home
i
found
that
summons
the
sheriff
left
here
let
me
see
it
was
away
back
in
that
i
was
sued
the
last
time
agent
for
a
cornplanter
sued
me
for
a
machine
i
never
ordered
and
it
was
worth
a
farthing
anyhow
that
was
on
my
greene
county
place
just
for
that
i
had
him
arrested
for
trespass
for
going
on
the
farm
to
take
away
the
machine
he
paid
the
costs
all
right
and
i
hope
he
learned
better
manners
this
reminiscence
recalled
with
evident
enjoyment
was
not
wholly
encouraging
it
seemed
darkly
possible
that
she
had
cited
a
precedent
applicable
to
every
case
where
she
was
haled
before
a
court
the
chairs
in
owen
office
were
decidedly
uncomfortable
bassett
crossed
and
recrossed
his
legs
and
pressed
his
hand
nervously
to
his
pocket
to
make
sure
of
his
for
he
was
prepared
to
pay
his
wife
aunt
for
her
shares
in
the
courier
newspaper
to
facilitate
her
elimination
as
a
in
the
suit
at
bar
it
was
contemptible
of
thatcher
to
drag
you
into
this
for
he
knew
you
took
those
shares
merely
to
help
me
out
i
sorry
it
has
turned
out
this
way
but
i
anxious
to
make
it
right
with
you
and
i
ready
to
buy
your
shares
at
your
own
price
of
course
she
chose
a
letter
from
the
afternoon
mail
and
opened
it
with
a
crumpling
the
envelope
and
dropping
it
over
her
shoulder
into
a
big
basket
she
was
not
apparently
overcome
by
his
magnanimity
well
well
she
said
glancing
over
the
letter
that
man
i
got
at
waupegan
is
turning
out
better
than
i
expected
when
i
put
him
there
or
else
he
the
greatest
living
liar
you
never
can
tell
about
these
people
well
well
oh
yes
morton
about
that
lawsuit
i
saw
edward
this
afternoon
and
had
a
little
talk
with
him
about
it
you
saw
thatcher
about
the
suit
i
most
certainly
did
morton
i
had
him
go
down
to
the
bank
to
talk
to
me
i
sorry
you
took
the
trouble
to
do
that
if
you
told
me
oh
i
not
afraid
of
edward
thatcher
if
a
man
brings
a
lawsuit
against
me
the
sooner
i
see
him
the
better
i
sent
word
to
edward
and
he
was
waiting
at
the
bank
when
i
got
there
i
given
thatcher
credit
for
being
above
dragging
a
woman
who
had
always
been
his
friend
into
a
lawsuit
he
certainly
owed
you
an
apology
i
did
see
it
just
that
way
morton
and
he
did
apologize
i
would
have
let
him
she
looked
at
him
over
her
glasses
disconcertingly
and
he
could
think
of
no
reply
it
was
possible
that
thatcher
had
bought
her
stock
or
that
she
had
made
him
bid
for
it
she
had
a
reputation
for
driving
hard
bargains
and
he
judged
from
her
manner
that
her
conference
with
thatcher
whatever
its
nature
had
not
been
unsatisfactory
he
recalled
with
exasperation
his
wife
displeasure
over
this
whole
affair
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
not
only
to
reëstablish
himself
with
owen
but
to
do
it
in
a
way
to
satisfy
bassett
you
need
worry
about
that
lawsuit
morton
there
ai
going
to
be
any
lawsuit
she
gave
this
time
to
soak
in
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
and
then
concluded
it
all
off
i
persuaded
edward
to
drop
the
suit
the
case
will
be
dismissed
in
the
morning
dismissed
how
dismissed
aunt
sally
just
dismissed
that
all
there
is
of
it
i
went
to
see
fitch
too
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
he
wrote
me
a
letter
i
found
here
saying
that
in
my
absence
he
taken
the
liberty
of
entering
an
appearance
for
me
along
with
you
in
the
case
i
told
him
i
attend
to
my
own
lawsuits
and
that
he
could
just
scratch
his
appearance
off
the
docket
the
presumption
of
her
lawyer
seemed
to
obscure
all
other
issues
for
the
moment
morton
bassett
was
annoyed
to
be
kept
waiting
for
an
explanation
that
was
clearly
due
him
as
her
he
controlled
his
irritation
with
difficulty
her
imprudence
in
having
approached
his
enemy
filled
him
with
forebodings
there
was
no
telling
what
compromises
she
might
have
negotiated
with
edward
thatcher
i
suppose
you
shamed
him
out
of
it
he
suggested
shamed
him
i
him
out
of
it
he
owns
a
lot
of
property
in
this
town
that
rented
for
unlawful
purposes
and
i
told
him
i
prosecute
him
that
and
a
few
other
things
he
offered
to
buy
me
out
at
a
good
price
but
he
did
get
very
far
with
that
it
was
a
good
figure
though
she
added
reflectively
his
spirits
rose
at
this
proof
of
her
loyalty
and
he
hastened
to
manifest
his
appreciation
his
wife
fears
would
be
dispelled
by
this
evidence
of
her
aunt
good
will
toward
the
family
i
rather
imagined
that
he
be
glad
to
quit
if
he
saw
an
easy
way
out
and
i
guess
you
gave
it
to
him
now
about
your
stock
aunt
sally
i
do
want
you
to
be
brought
into
my
troubles
with
thatcher
any
further
i
appreciate
your
help
so
far
and
i
able
now
to
pay
for
your
shares
i
do
doubt
that
ed
offered
you
a
generous
price
to
get
a
controlling
interest
i
write
a
check
for
any
sum
you
name
and
you
have
my
gratitude
besides
he
drew
out
his
and
laid
it
on
the
table
with
a
feeling
that
money
which
according
to
tradition
is
a
talkative
commodity
might
now
conclude
the
conversation
owen
saw
the
looked
at
it
over
her
glasses
apparently
without
emotion
i
not
going
to
sell
those
shares
morton
not
to
you
or
anybody
else
but
as
a
matter
of
maintaining
my
own
dignity
your
own
dignity
is
something
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
morton
i
been
watching
you
ever
since
you
married
hallie
and
wondering
just
where
you
bump
you
and
edward
thatcher
have
been
pretty
thick
and
you
had
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
politics
this
row
you
got
into
with
him
was
bound
to
come
i
know
edward
better
just
a
little
better
than
i
know
you
he
not
a
beautiful
character
but
he
not
as
bad
as
they
make
out
but
you
given
him
a
hard
rub
the
wrong
way
and
he
going
to
get
even
with
you
he
mighty
bitter
bitterer
than
it
healthy
for
one
man
to
be
against
another
if
it
had
been
for
this
newspaper
fuss
i
should
ever
have
said
a
word
to
you
about
it
but
i
advise
you
to
straighten
things
up
with
edward
you
better
do
it
for
your
own
good
for
hallie
and
the
children
you
insulted
him
and
held
him
up
to
the
whole
state
of
indiana
as
a
fool
you
need
think
he
know
just
where
you
gripped
that
convention
tight
and
just
where
you
let
him
have
it
to
play
with
he
got
more
money
than
you
have
and
he
going
to
spend
it
to
give
you
some
of
your
own
medicine
or
worse
if
he
can
he
like
a
mule
that
lays
for
the
nigger
that
put
burrs
under
his
collar
you
that
particular
nigger
just
now
you
made
a
mistake
morton
but
aunt
sally
i
did
about
that
newspaper
morton
she
continued
ignoring
him
decided
that
i
just
hang
on
to
my
stock
you
built
up
the
better
than
i
expected
and
that
last
statement
showed
it
to
be
doing
fine
i
do
know
any
place
right
now
where
i
can
do
as
well
with
the
money
you
see
i
got
about
all
the
farms
i
can
handle
at
my
age
and
it
will
be
some
fun
to
have
a
hand
in
running
a
newspaper
i
want
you
to
tell
down
at
the
office
what
his
name
atwill
well
you
tell
him
i
want
this
look
listen
business
stopped
if
you
ca
think
of
anything
smarter
to
do
than
that
you
better
quit
you
had
no
business
to
turn
a
newspaper
against
a
man
who
owns
half
of
it
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
get
off
the
track
you
whistled
morton
after
you
had
pitched
him
and
his
buggy
into
the
ditch
and
killed
his
horse
but
who
had
put
him
on
the
track
i
had
he
been
running
over
the
state
for
two
years
to
my
knowledge
trying
to
undermine
me
i
was
only
giving
him
in
broad
daylight
what
he
was
giving
me
in
the
dark
you
do
understand
this
aunt
sally
he
been
playing
on
your
feelings
morton
bassett
there
ai
a
man
on
earth
that
can
play
on
my
feelings
i
did
let
him
jump
on
you
and
i
do
intend
to
let
you
abuse
him
i
told
you
to
stop
nagging
him
but
i
have
any
idea
you
do
it
that
your
business
if
you
want
a
big
bump
you
go
on
and
get
it
about
this
newspaper
i
going
to
keep
my
shares
and
told
edward
that
you
would
use
the
paper
as
a
club
on
him
while
i
was
interested
in
it
you
can
print
all
the
politics
you
want
but
it
must
be
clean
politics
straight
out
from
the
shoulder
he
had
lapsed
into
sullen
silence
too
stunned
to
interrupt
the
placid
flow
of
her
speech
she
had
not
only
meddled
in
his
affairs
in
a
fashion
that
would
afford
comfort
to
his
enemy
but
she
was
now
dictating
terms
this
old
woman
whose
mild
tone
was
in
itself
maddening
the
fear
of
incurring
his
wife
wrath
alone
checked
an
outburst
of
indignation
in
all
his
life
no
one
had
ever
warned
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
pursuing
a
course
that
led
to
destruction
he
had
always
enjoyed
her
capriciousness
her
whimsical
humor
but
there
was
certainly
nothing
for
him
to
smile
at
in
this
interview
she
had
so
plied
the
lash
that
it
cut
to
the
quick
his
pride
and
were
deeply
wounded
his
wife
elderly
aunt
did
not
believe
in
his
omnipotence
this
was
a
shock
in
itself
but
what
fantastic
nonsense
was
she
uttering
now
since
i
bought
that
stock
morton
i
been
reading
the
clean
through
every
day
and
there
are
some
things
about
that
paper
i
do
like
i
guess
you
and
edward
thatcher
ai
so
particularly
religious
and
when
you
took
hold
of
it
you
cut
out
that
religious
page
they
used
to
print
every
sunday
you
better
tell
atwill
to
start
that
up
again
i
notice
too
that
the
sneaks
in
little
stingers
at
the
jews
occasionally
they
may
just
get
in
by
mistake
but
you
ought
to
have
a
rule
at
the
office
against
printing
stories
as
old
as
the
hills
about
jews
burning
down
their
to
get
the
insurance
known
a
few
gentiles
that
did
that
the
only
man
i
know
that
i
lend
money
to
without
security
is
a
jew
let
not
jump
on
people
just
to
hurt
their
feelings
and
besides
we
do
any
of
us
know
much
more
these
days
than
old
moses
knew
and
that
fellow
who
writes
the
little
pieces
under
the
regular
editorials
he
too
smart
and
he
ai
always
as
funny
as
he
thinks
he
is
there
no
use
in
popping
at
things
if
they
ai
right
and
that
fellow
always
trying
to
hurt
somebody
feelings
without
doing
anybody
any
good
she
opened
a
drawer
of
her
desk
and
drew
out
a
memorandum
to
refresh
her
memory
you
got
a
whole
page
and
on
sundays
two
pages
about
baseball
and
automobiles
and
the
horse
is
getting
crowded
down
into
a
corner
we
he
was
not
unmindful
of
the
plural
we
must
print
more
horse
news
you
tell
atwill
to
send
his
young
man
that
does
the
and
around
to
see
me
occasionally
and
i
be
glad
to
help
him
get
some
horse
news
that
is
news
i
would
want
to
have
you
bounce
a
young
man
who
doing
the
best
he
can
but
it
does
do
a
newspaper
any
good
to
speak
of
dan
patch
as
a
or
give
the
record
of
my
filly
penelope
o
as
when
she
made
a
clean
you
got
to
print
facts
in
a
newspaper
if
you
want
people
to
respect
it
how
about
that
morton
you
right
aunt
sally
i
speak
to
atwill
about
his
horse
news
he
began
to
wonder
whether
she
were
not
amusing
herself
at
his
expense
but
she
gave
him
no
reason
for
doubting
her
seriousness
they
might
have
been
partners
from
the
beginning
of
time
from
her
businesslike
manner
of
criticizing
the
paper
she
had
not
only
flatly
refused
to
sell
her
shares
but
she
was
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
for
which
she
seemed
to
be
prepared
to
tell
him
how
the
courier
should
be
conducted
about
farming
morton
she
continued
deliberately
the
has
fun
every
now
and
then
over
the
poor
but
honest
farmer
and
prints
pictures
of
him
when
he
comes
to
town
for
the
state
fair
that
make
him
look
like
a
scarecrow
farming
morton
is
a
profession
nowadays
and
those
poor
yaps
eggleston
wrote
about
in
hoosier
schoolmaster
were
all
dead
and
buried
before
you
were
born
farmers
are
up
and
coming
i
can
tell
you
and
i
would
lose
their
business
by
poking
fun
at
that
saturday
column
of
farm
news
by
the
way
is
a
fraud
all
stolen
out
of
the
farmers
weekly
and
no
credit
they
must
keep
that
column
in
cold
storage
to
run
it
the
way
they
do
they
usually
about
a
season
behind
time
telling
how
to
plant
corn
along
in
august
and
planting
winter
wheat
about
christmas
our
farm
editor
must
have
been
raised
on
a
new
york
another
thing
i
want
to
speak
of
is
the
space
they
give
to
farmers
and
stockmen
societies
when
they
meet
here
the
last
time
the
hoosier
state
mulefoot
hog
association
met
right
here
in
town
at
the
horticultural
society
room
at
the
state
house
all
the
notice
they
got
in
the
was
five
lines
in
mention
the
same
day
the
state
bankers
association
filled
three
columns
and
most
of
that
was
a
speech
by
tom
adams
on
currency
reform
you
might
tell
that
funny
editorial
man
to
give
adams
a
poke
now
and
then
and
stop
throwing
chestnuts
about
gold
bricks
and
green
goods
at
farmers
and
he
need
show
the
bad
state
of
his
liver
by
sarcastically
speaking
of
farmers
as
honest
husbandmen
either
a
farmer
is
a
farmer
unless
for
lack
of
god
grace
he
a
fool
i
guess
the
folks
are
coming
now
i
hope
allen
wo
knock
down
the
house
with
that
of
his
that
all
this
time
let
me
see
you
better
tell
your
editor
to
call
on
me
now
and
then
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
morton
atwill
arthur
is
he
a
son
of
that
ebenezer
atwill
who
used
to
be
a
professor
in
asbury
college
i
afraid
not
aunt
sally
i
do
think
he
ever
heard
of
ebenezer
replied
bassett
with
all
the
irony
he
dared
chapter
xxii
the
gray
sisterhood
elizabeth
house
was
hospitable
to
male
visitors
and
dan
found
sylvia
there
often
on
the
warm
still
summer
evenings
when
the
young
women
of
the
household
filled
the
veranda
and
overflowed
upon
the
steps
choice
of
a
had
puzzled
dan
a
good
deal
but
there
were
a
good
many
things
about
sylvia
that
baffled
him
for
example
this
preparation
for
teaching
in
a
public
school
when
she
might
have
had
an
assistant
professorship
in
a
college
seemed
a
sad
waste
of
energy
and
opportunity
she
was
going
to
school
to
her
inferiors
he
maintained
submitting
to
instruction
as
meekly
as
though
she
were
not
qualified
to
enlighten
her
teachers
in
any
branch
of
knowledge
it
was
preposterous
that
she
should
deliberately
elect
to
spend
the
hottest
of
summers
in
learning
to
combine
the
principles
of
pestalozzi
with
the
methods
of
dewey
and
kendall
the
acquaintance
of
sylvia
and
allen
prospered
from
the
start
she
was
not
only
a
new
girl
in
town
and
one
capable
of
debating
the
questions
that
interested
him
but
he
was
charmed
with
elizabeth
house
which
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
declared
that
he
had
always
stood
for
the
democracy
of
the
veranda
the
good
humor
and
ready
give
and
take
of
the
young
women
delighted
him
they
liked
him
and
openly
called
him
our
beau
he
established
himself
on
excellent
terms
with
the
matron
to
the
end
that
he
might
fill
his
automobile
with
her
charges
frequently
and
take
them
for
runs
into
the
country
when
dan
grumbled
over
absurd
immolation
on
the
altar
of
education
allen
pronounced
her
the
grandest
girl
in
the
world
and
the
glory
of
the
great
experiment
sylvia
was
intent
these
days
upon
fitting
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
for
teaching
becoming
a
part
of
the
established
system
and
avoiding
none
of
the
processes
by
which
teachers
are
created
her
fellow
students
most
of
whom
were
younger
than
she
were
practically
all
the
green
fruitage
of
high
schools
but
she
asked
no
immunities
or
privileges
by
reason
of
her
college
training
she
yielded
herself
submissively
to
the
system
and
established
herself
among
the
other
novices
on
a
footing
of
good
comradeship
during
the
hot
vexatious
days
she
met
them
with
unfailing
good
cheer
the
inspiring
example
of
her
college
teachers
and
not
least
the
belief
she
had
absorbed
on
the
madison
campus
in
her
girlhood
that
teaching
is
a
high
calling
eased
the
way
for
her
at
times
when
as
occasionally
happened
she
failed
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
system
the
superintendent
of
schools
dropping
into
the
normal
after
hours
caught
sylvia
in
the
act
of
demonstrating
a
problem
in
geometry
on
the
blackboard
for
the
benefit
of
a
fellow
student
who
had
not
yet
abandoned
the
hope
of
entering
the
state
university
that
fall
the
superintendent
had
been
in
quest
of
a
teacher
of
mathematics
for
the
manual
training
school
and
on
appealing
to
the
wellesley
authorities
they
had
sent
him
sylvia
name
sylvia
the
chalk
still
in
her
fingers
met
his
humorous
reproaches
smilingly
she
had
made
him
appear
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
he
said
sylvia
declined
his
offer
and
smiled
the
superintendent
was
not
used
to
smiles
like
that
in
his
corps
and
this
confident
young
woman
seemed
to
know
what
she
was
about
he
went
away
mystified
and
meeting
john
ware
related
his
experience
ware
laughed
and
slapped
his
knee
you
let
that
girl
alone
the
minister
said
she
has
her
finger
on
time
wrist
physician
of
the
golden
age
remember
matthew
arnold
lines
on
goethe
good
poem
sylvia
wants
to
know
causes
of
things
watch
her
great
nature
at
seven
on
a
morning
of
september
sylvia
left
elizabeth
house
to
begin
her
novitiate
as
a
teacher
allen
had
declared
his
intention
of
sending
his
automobile
for
her
every
morning
an
offer
that
was
promptly
declined
however
on
that
bright
morning
when
the
young
world
turned
schoolward
harwood
lay
in
wait
for
her
this
must
never
happen
again
sir
and
of
course
you
may
not
carry
my
books
they
the
symbol
of
my
profession
seventeen
thousand
young
persons
about
like
me
are
on
the
way
to
school
this
morning
right
here
in
indiana
it
would
be
frightfully
embarrassing
to
the
educational
system
if
young
gentlemen
were
allowed
to
carry
the
implements
of
our
trade
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
now
i
never
get
up
as
early
as
this
unless
catching
a
train
so
much
the
worse
for
you
then
there
will
be
mornings
when
you
wo
think
it
so
much
fun
it
rains
and
snows
in
indiana
sometimes
he
still
resented
the
idea
of
her
sacrifice
as
he
called
it
in
the
cause
of
education
they
were
now
so
well
acquainted
that
they
were
not
always
careful
to
be
polite
in
their
talk
but
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
she
did
wholly
approve
of
him
all
summer
when
they
had
discussed
politics
she
had
avoided
touching
upon
his
personal
interests
and
activities
his
alliance
with
bassett
emphasized
in
the
state
convention
was
a
subject
she
clearly
avoided
this
morning
as
he
kept
time
to
her
quick
step
he
craved
her
interest
and
sympathy
her
plain
gray
suit
and
simple
cloth
hat
could
not
disguise
her
charm
or
grace
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
putting
herself
a
little
further
away
from
him
that
she
was
approaching
the
business
of
life
with
a
determination
a
spirit
a
zest
that
dwarfed
to
insignificance
his
own
preoccupation
with
far
less
important
matters
she
turned
to
glance
back
at
a
group
of
children
they
had
passed
audibly
speculating
as
to
the
character
of
teacher
the
day
held
in
store
for
them
do
you
think
they
worth
working
for
sylvia
asked
dan
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
more
lives
are
ground
up
in
the
machine
than
in
any
other
way
go
on
the
girl
who
taught
me
my
alphabet
in
the
little
red
in
harrison
county
earned
her
salary
i
can
tell
you
she
was
seventeen
and
wore
a
pink
dress
i
sorry
you
do
approve
of
me
or
my
clothes
now
allen
approves
of
me
i
like
allen
his
approval
is
important
i
dare
say
yes
very
it
nice
to
be
approved
of
it
helps
some
and
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be
a
certain
reciprocity
in
approval
and
disapproval
oh
there
bound
to
be
their
eyes
met
and
they
laughed
lightheartedly
i
going
to
tell
you
something
said
dan
on
the
reciprocal
theory
i
ca
expect
anything
but
i
lonesome
and
have
no
friends
anyhow
so
i
give
you
a
chance
to
say
something
withering
and
edged
with
a
fine
scorn
good
i
promise
not
to
disappoint
you
i
going
to
be
put
on
the
legislature
ticket
to
fill
a
vacancy
i
suppose
you
pray
earnestly
for
my
defeat
why
should
i
waste
prayers
on
that
besides
allen
solemnly
declares
that
the
people
are
to
be
trusted
it
not
for
me
to
set
my
prayers
against
the
will
of
the
if
you
had
a
vote
he
persisted
you
would
vote
for
me
i
should
have
to
know
what
you
want
to
go
to
the
legislature
for
before
committing
myself
what
you
doing
it
for
to
do
all
the
mischief
i
can
of
course
to
support
all
the
worst
measures
that
come
up
to
jump
when
the
boss
whip
cracks
she
refused
to
meet
him
on
this
ground
he
saw
that
any
expectation
he
might
have
that
she
would
urge
him
to
pledge
himself
to
noble
endeavor
and
high
achievements
as
a
state
legislator
were
doomed
to
disappointment
he
was
taken
aback
by
the
tone
of
her
retort
i
hope
you
will
do
all
those
things
you
could
do
nothing
better
calculated
to
help
your
chances
chances
your
chances
and
we
do
any
of
us
have
too
many
of
coming
to
some
good
sometime
i
believe
you
are
really
serious
but
i
do
understand
you
then
i
shall
be
explicit
just
this
then
to
play
the
ungrateful
part
of
the
frank
friend
the
sooner
you
get
your
fingers
burnt
the
sooner
you
will
let
the
fire
alone
i
suppose
bassett
has
given
the
word
that
you
are
graciously
to
be
permitted
to
sit
in
his
legislature
he
could
hardly
do
less
for
you
than
that
after
he
sent
you
into
the
arena
last
june
to
prod
the
sick
lion
for
his
entertainment
they
were
waiting
at
a
corner
for
a
break
in
the
street
traffic
and
he
turned
toward
her
guardedly
you
put
it
pretty
low
he
mumbled
the
thing
itself
is
not
so
bad
from
what
i
have
heard
and
read
about
bassett
i
do
think
he
is
really
an
evil
person
he
probably
did
start
with
any
sort
of
ideals
of
public
life
you
did
i
read
in
an
essay
the
other
night
that
the
appeal
of
the
highest
should
be
always
to
the
lowest
but
you
not
appealing
to
anybody
you
just
following
the
band
wagon
to
the
centre
of
the
track
stop
look
listen
you
come
far
enough
with
me
now
the
walls
of
my
prison
house
loom
before
me
and
good
luck
that
night
sylvia
wrote
a
letter
to
one
of
her
classmates
in
boston
i
a
she
said
a
member
of
the
gray
sisterhood
of
american
nuns
all
over
this
astonishing
country
my
sisters
of
this
honorable
order
rise
up
in
the
morning
even
as
you
and
i
to
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
i
look
with
veneration
upon
those
of
our
sisterhood
who
have
grown
old
in
the
classroom
i
can
see
myself
reduced
to
a
bundle
of
nerves
irascible
worthless
ready
for
the
at
we
will
say
only
twenty
years
ahead
of
me
my
work
looks
so
easy
and
i
like
it
so
much
that
i
went
in
fright
to
the
dictionary
to
look
up
the
definition
of
teacher
i
find
that
i
one
who
teaches
or
instructs
think
of
it
i
that
definition
should
be
revised
to
read
one
who
conveying
certain
information
to
others
reads
in
fifty
faces
unanswerable
questions
as
to
the
riddle
of
existence
a
place
where
the
presumably
wise
are
convinced
of
their
own
folly
note
well
my
friend
i
am
a
gray
sister
in
a
gray
serge
suit
that
fits
with
white
cuffs
and
collar
and
with
chalk
on
my
fingers
oh
it
not
what
i
required
to
teach
but
what
i
going
to

lüders
shop
was
not
far
from
sylvia
school
and
allen
devised
many
excuses
for
waylaying
her
his
machine
being
forbidden
he
hung
about
until
she
appeared
and
trudged
homeward
with
her
often
he
came
in
a
glow
from
the
cabinetmaker
and
submitted
for
her
judgment
the
questions
that
had
been
debated
that
day
at
the
shop
there
was
something
sweet
and
wistful
and
charming
in
his
boyishness
and
she
was
surprised
as
harwood
had
been
from
the
first
by
the
intelligence
he
evinced
in
political
and
social
questions
he
demanded
absolute
answers
to
problems
that
were
perplexing
wise
men
all
over
the
world
if
i
could
answer
that
she
would
say
to
him
i
should
be
entitled
to
a
monument
more
enduring
than
brass
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
mankind
is
to
be
won
in
a
day
we
must
pull
up
the
old
tree
till
we
got
a
new
one
planted
and
growing
the
great
experiment
will
turn
out
all
right
yet
some
fellow
we
never
heard
of
will
give
the
lever
a
jerk
some
day
and
there
will
be
a
rumble
and
a
flash
and
it
will
run
perfectly
he
asserted
the
state
campaign
got
under
way
in
october
and
harwood
was
often
discussed
in
relation
to
it
allen
always
praised
dan
extravagantly
and
was
ever
alert
to
defend
him
against
her
criticisms
my
dad
will
run
the
roller
over
bassett
but
dan
will
be
smart
enough
to
get
from
under
it
the
greatest
show
on
earth
continuous
vaudeville
this
politics
dan
all
right
he
got
more
brains
than
bassett
one
of
these
days
dan
will
take
a
flop
and
land
clean
over
in
the
thatcher
camp
it
only
a
matter
of
time
gratitude
and
considerations
like
that
are
holding
him
back
but
i
not
a
partisan
not
even
on
dad
side
i
the
philosopher
who
sits
on
the
fence
and
keeps
the
score
by
innings
it
seemed
to
her
in
those
days
and
afterward
that
allen
symbolized
the
unknown
quantity
in
all
the
problems
that
absorbed
him
his
idealism
was
not
a
thing
of
the
air
but
a
flowering
from
old
and
vigorous
roots
his
politics
was
a
kind
of
religion
and
it
did
not
prove
upon
analysis
to
be
either
so
fantastical
or
so
fanatical
as
she
had
believed
at
first
as
the
days
shortened
he
would
prolong
their
walk
until
the
shops
and
factories
discharged
their
employees
upon
the
streets
the
fine
thing
about
the
people
was
he
said
the
fact
that
they
were
content
to
go
on
from
day
to
day
doing
the
things
they
did
when
the
restraints
upon
them
were
so
light
it
proved
the
enduring
worth
of
the
great
experiment
then
they
would
plunge
into
the
thick
of
the
crowd
and
cross
the
monument
plaza
where
he
never
failed
to
pay
a
tribute
in
his
own
fashion
to
the
men
the
gray
shaft
commemorated
in
these
walks
they
spoke
french
which
he
employed
more
readily
than
she
in
his
high
moods
it
seemed
to
express
him
better
than
english
it
amused
him
to
apply
new
names
to
the
thoroughfares
they
traversed
for
example
he
gayly
renamed
monument
place
the
place
de
la
concorde
assuring
her
that
the
southward
vista
in
the
rue
de
la
méridienne
disclosing
the
terrace
of
the
new
federal
building
and
the
electric
torches
of
the
monument
beyond
was
highly
reminiscent
of
paris
sylvia
was
able
to
dramatize
for
herself
from
the
abundant
material
he
artlessly
supplied
the
life
he
had
led
abroad
during
his
long
exile
as
a
youngster
he
had
enjoyed
untrammeled
freedom
of
the
streets
of
paris
and
berlin
and
he
showed
a
curiously
developed
sympathy
for
the
lives
of
the
poor
and
unfortunate
that
had
been
born
of
those
early
experiences
he
was
a
great
resource
to
her
and
she
enjoyed
him
as
she
would
have
enjoyed
a
girl
comrade
he
confessed
his
admiration
for
marian
in
the
frankest
fashion
she
was
adorable
the
greatest
girl
in
the
world
ah
sometime
he
would
say
who
knows
chapter
xxiii
a
on
the
kankakee
harwood
faith
in
bassett
as
a
political
prophet
was
badly
shaken
by
the
result
of
the
campaign
that
fall
about
half
the
democratic
candidates
for
state
office
were
elected
but
even
more
surprising
was
the
of
a
good
working
majority
in
both
houses
of
the
general
assembly
if
thatcher
had
knifed
bassett
men
or
if
thatcher
men
had
been
knifed
at
bassett
behest
evidence
of
such
perfidy
was
difficult
to
adduce
from
the
returns
harwood
was
not
sure
as
he
studied
the
figures
whether
his
party
surprising
success
was
attributable
to
a
development
of
real
strength
in
thatcher
who
had
been
much
in
evidence
throughout
the
campaign
or
whether
bassett
deserved
the
credit
he
was
disposed
to
think
it
only
another
expression
of
that
capriciousness
of
the
electorate
which
is
often
manifested
in
years
when
national
success
is
not
directly
involved
while
thatcher
and
bassett
had
apparently
struck
a
truce
and
harmonized
their
factions
harwood
had
at
no
time
entertained
illusions
as
to
the
real
attitude
of
the
men
toward
each
other
when
the
between
the
leaders
was
mentioned
among
thatcher
intimates
they
were
prone
to
declare
that
ed
would
get
bassett
it
might
take
time
but
the
day
of
retribution
would
surely
come
as
a
candidate
for
the
lower
house
in
marion
county
harwood
had
been
thrust
forward
prominently
into
a
campaign
whose
liveliness
belied
the
traditional
apathy
of
off
years
on
the
saturday
night
before
the
election
thatcher
and
bassett
had
appeared
together
on
the
platform
at
a
great
meeting
at
the
capital
one
of
those
final
flourishes
by
which
county
chairmen
are
prone
to
hearten
their
legions
against
the
battle
bassett
had
spoken
for
ten
minutes
at
this
rally
urging
support
of
the
ticket
and
in
crisp
phrases
giving
the
lie
to
reports
of
his
lukewarmness
his
speech
was
the
more
noteworthy
from
the
fact
that
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
his
political
career
that
he
had
ever
spoken
at
a
political
meeting
and
there
was
no
questioning
its
favorable
impression
bassett
was
moreover
reelected
to
his
old
seat
in
the
senate
without
difficulty
and
harwood
ran
ahead
of
his
associates
on
the
legislative
ticket
in
marion
county
scoring
a
plurality
that
testified
to
his
personal
popularity
another
campaign
must
intervene
before
the
united
states
senatorship
became
an
acute
issue
and
meanwhile
the
party
in
the
state
had
not
in
many
years
been
so
united
credit
was
freely
given
to
the
courier
for
the
formidable
strength
developed
by
the
democracy
and
it
had
become
indubitably
a
vigorous
and
conservative
reflector
of
party
opinion
without
estranging
a
growing
constituency
of
readers
who
liked
its
clean
and
orderly
presentation
of
general
news
the
ownership
of
the
newspaper
had
become
since
the
abrupt
termination
of
the
lawsuit
instituted
by
thatcher
almost
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
formerly
harwood
intimate
relations
with
it
had
not
been
revived
and
neither
owen
nor
bassett
ever
spoke
to
him
of
the
newspaper
except
in
the
most
casual
fashion
dan
was
conscious
that
the
senator
from
fraser
had
changed
in
the
years
that
had
passed
since
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
bassett
had
outwardly
altered
little
as
he
crossed
the
watershed
of
middle
life
but
it
seemed
to
dan
that
the
he
had
manifested
in
the
thatcher
affair
had
marked
a
climacteric
the
and
restraint
that
had
so
impressed
him
at
first
had
visibly
diminished
what
harwood
had
taken
for
steel
seemed
to
him
now
only
iron
after
all
and
brittle
iron
during
the
last
week
of
the
campaign
an
incident
occurred
that
shook
harwood
a
good
deal
he
had
been
away
from
the
capital
for
several
days
making
speeches
and
finding
that
his
itinerary
would
permit
it
he
ran
into
town
unexpectedly
one
night
to
replenish
his
linen
and
look
at
his
mail
an
interurban
car
landed
him
in
town
at
eleven
and
he
went
directly
to
the
boordman
building
as
he
walked
down
the
hall
toward
his
office
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
light
showing
on
the
door
of
room
though
bassett
kept
a
room
at
the
whitcomb
for
private
conferences
he
occasionally
used
his
office
in
the
boordman
for
the
purpose
and
seeing
the
rooms
lighted
dan
expected
to
find
him
there
he
tried
the
door
and
found
it
locked
and
as
he
drew
out
his
key
he
heard
suddenly
the
click
of
the
typewriter
inside
miss
farrell
was
rarely
at
the
office
at
night
but
as
harwood
opened
the
door
he
found
her
busily
tapping
the
keys
of
her
machine
she
swung
round
quickly
with
an
air
of
surprise
stretched
herself
and
yawned
well
i
was
exactly
looking
for
you
but
i
ca
deny
that
i
glad
to
be
interrupted
hope
you
do
mind
my
doing
a
small
job
on
the
side
as
harwood
stood
in
hand
blinking
at
her
he
heard
a
door
farther
down
the
hall
close
followed
by
a
step
in
the
hall
outside
harwood
had
seen
no
lights
in
the
neighboring
offices
as
he
crossed
the
hall
and
in
his
frequent
long
night
vigils
with
his
law
books
it
was
the
rarest
thing
to
find
any
of
the
neighboring
tenants
about
he
turned
quickly
to
the
door
while
the
retreating
steps
were
still
audible
oh
rose
had
from
her
seat
as
he
put
his
hand
to
the
knob
and
her
tone
of
alarm
arrested
him
instead
of
flinging
open
the
door
he
dropped
his
bag
into
a
corner
his
face
flushed
with
sudden
anger
i
did
suppose
you
mind
my
doing
a
little
extra
work
out
of
hours
harwood
colonel
ramsay
was
in
the
office
to
see
bassett
this
afternoon
and
asked
me
to
take
some
dictation
for
him
i
guess
about
time
for
me
to
go
home
she
pulled
the
sheet
of
paper
from
the
typewriter
with
a
sharp
and
dropped
it
into
a
drawer
with
a
single
deft
twist
of
the
wrist
the
colonel
did
mention
it
to
me
remarked
dan
feigning
indifference
and
not
looking
at
her
he
was
making
a
speech
at
terre
haute
when
i
left
there
he
tried
to
minimize
the
disagreeable
aspects
of
the
matter
rose
had
been
employed
by
bassett
as
stenographer
to
one
of
his
legislative
committees
before
dan
relations
with
the
politician
began
since
harwood
employed
her
bassett
had
made
use
of
her
constantly
in
the
writing
of
letters
there
would
have
been
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
calling
her
to
the
office
for
an
evening
work
it
was
the
falsehood
about
ramsay
and
the
quiet
closing
of
the
door
of
inner
room
that
disturbed
harwood
he
passed
into
the
library
and
rose
left
without
saying
the
incident
annoyed
dan
bassett
step
had
been
unmistakable
and
the
girl
confusion
had
its
disagreeable
significance
he
had
not
thought
this
of
bassett
it
was
inconsonant
with
the
character
of
man
he
still
believed
morton
bassett
to
be
in
winding
up
the
receivership
of
the
paper
company
bassett
had
treated
harwood
generously
dan
was
out
of
debt
he
had
added
forty
acres
of
good
land
to
his
father
farm
and
he
kept
a
little
money
in
bank
he
had
even
made
a
few
small
investments
in
local
securities
that
promised
well
and
his
practice
had
become
quite
independent
of
bassett
almost
imperceptibly
bassett
had
ceased
to
be
a
factor
in
his
prosperity
the
office
in
the
boordman
building
remained
the
same
and
bassett
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
there
there
were
days
when
he
seemed
deeply
preoccupied
and
he
sometimes
buried
himself
in
his
room
without
obvious
reason
then
after
an
interval
he
would
come
out
and
throw
his
leg
over
a
corner
of
dan
desk
and
talk
to
him
with
his
earlier
frankness
once
he
suggested
that
dan
might
like
to
leave
the
boordman
for
a
new
office
building
that
was
lifting
the
urban
skyline
but
the
following
day
he
came
rather
pointedly
to
dan
desk
and
with
an
embarrassment
he
rarely
showed
said
that
of
course
if
dan
moved
he
should
expect
to
go
with
him
he
hoped
dan
had
understood
that
a
few
days
later
he
entrusted
dan
with
several
commissions
that
he
seemed
to
have
devised
solely
to
show
his
good
will
and
confidence
harwood
was
happy
these
days
he
was
still
young
and
life
had
dealt
kindly
with
him
among
lawyers
he
was
pointed
to
as
a
coming
light
of
the
bar
and
in
politics
he
was
the
most
conspicuous
man
of
his
age
in
the
state
he
was
invited
to
harrison
county
that
fall
to
deliver
an
address
at
a
reunion
of
the
veterans
of
his
father
regiment
and
that
had
pleased
him
he
had
more
than
justified
the
hopes
of
his
parents
and
brothers
and
they
were
very
proud
of
him
while
they
did
not
understand
his
apostasy
from
the
family
stern
republicanism
this
did
not
greatly
matter
when
dan
name
so
often
came
floating
home
in
the
indianapolis
newspapers
his
mother
kept
careful
track
of
his
social
enthrallments
her
son
was
frequently
among
those
present
at
private
and
public
dinners
and
when
the
president
of
yale
visited
indiana
dan
spoke
at
the
banquet
given
in
his
honor
by
the
alumni
and
not
without
emotion
does
a
woman
whose
life
has
been
spent
on
a
humble
farm
find
that
her
son
has
won
a
place
among
people
of
distinction
in
a
city
which
is
to
her
the
capital
of
the
universe
there
were
times
when
dan
wished
to
be
free
of
bassett
he
had
reached
a
point
where
bassett
was
not
only
of
little
service
to
him
but
where
he
felt
he
was
of
little
use
to
bassett
and
it
was
irksome
to
find
that
all
the
local
newspapers
except
the
courier
constantly
identified
the
boordman
building
with
bassett
political
activities
amid
all
the
agitations
of
the
campaign
dan
had
seen
as
much
as
possible
of
sylvia
the
settlement
of
andrew
kelton
estate
gave
him
an
excuse
for
consulting
her
frequently
but
he
sought
her
frankly
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
he
found
that
she
was
a
good
deal
at
owen
and
it
was
pleasanter
to
run
in
upon
her
there
than
at
elizabeth
house
where
they
must
needs
share
the
parlor
with
other
callers
often
he
and
allen
met
at
owen
and
debated
the
questions
that
were
forever
perplexing
young
thatcher
eager
mind
debates
that
owen
suffered
to
run
so
far
and
then
terminated
with
a
keen
observation
that
left
no
more
to
be
said
sending
them
to
the
pantry
to
forage
for
food
and
drink
thatcher
had
resented
for
a
time
harwood
participation
in
his
humiliation
at
the
convention
but
his
had
not
been
proof
against
allen
warm
defense
thatcher
devotion
to
his
son
had
in
it
a
kind
of
pathos
and
it
was
not
in
him
to
vent
his
spleen
against
his
son
best
friend
a
few
days
after
the
election
thatcher
invited
harwood
to
join
him
and
allen
in
a
week
shooting
in
the
kankakee
where
he
owned
a
that
allen
had
never
seen
come
up
dan
and
rest
your
voice
it
a
good
place
to
loaf
and
take
john
ware
along
as
our
moral
uplifter
maybe
we
pot
a
few
ducks
but
if
we
do
we
get
away
from
our
troubles
for
a
little
while
anyhow
the
proved
to
be
commodious
and
comfortable
and
the
ducks
scarce
enough
to
make
the
hunter
earn
his
supper
i
may
say
in
parenthesis
that
long
before
thatcher
day
many
great
and
good
hoosiers
scattered
birdshot
over
the
kankakee
marshes
which
alack
have
been
drained
to
increase
indiana
total
area
of
arable
soil
lew
wallace
and
other
hoosier
generals
and
judges
used
to
hunt
ducks
on
the
kankakee
and
maurice
thompson
not
only
camped
there
but
wrote
a
poem
about
the
marshes
a
poem
that
a
poem
all
about
the
bittern
and
the
plover
and
the
heron
which
always
at
the
right
season
called
him
away
from
the
desk
and
the
town
to
try
his
bow
he
was
the
last
of
the
toxophilites
on
winged
things
he
scorned
to
destroy
with
gunpowder
oh
what
a
good
fellow
you
were
maurice
thompson
and
what
songs
you
wrote
of
our
lakes
and
rivers
and
feathered
things
and
how
i
gloated
over
those
songs
of
fair
weather
in
old
atlantics
in
my
garret
before
they
were
bound
into
that
slim
long
volume
with
the
heron
on
its
cover
john
ware
an
ancient
and
honorable
son
of
the
tribe
of
nimrod
was
the
best
of
comrades
the
striking
quality
in
ware
was
his
beautiful
humanness
which
had
given
him
a
peculiar
hold
upon
men
thatcher
was
far
from
being
a
saint
but
like
many
other
cheerful
sinners
in
our
capital
he
had
gone
to
church
in
the
days
when
ware
occupied
the
first
congregational
pulpit
a
good
many
years
had
passed
since
ware
had
been
a
captain
of
cavalry
chasing
stuart
boys
in
the
valley
of
virginia
but
he
was
still
a
capital
wing
shot
a
is
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
talk
and
the
talk
in
thatcher
boat
around
the
stove
was
good
those
crisp
november
evenings
on
sunday
ware
tramped
off
to
a
country
church
taking
his
companions
with
him
it
was
too
bad
to
miss
the
ducks
he
said
but
a
day
peace
in
the
marshes
gave
them
a
chance
to
accumulate
that
evening
he
talked
of
emerson
with
whom
he
had
spoken
face
to
face
in
concord
in
that
whitest
of
houses
we
should
bring
this
into
our
pages
if
it
been
that
ware
talk
in
that
connection
interested
thatcher
greatly
and
ordinarily
thatcher
knew
and
cared
less
about
emerson
than
about
the
vedic
hymns
allen
was
serenely
happy
to
be
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
company
of
a
man
who
had
fought
with
sheridan
heard
phillips
speak
and
talked
to
john
brown
and
emerson
when
ware
had
described
his
interview
with
the
poet
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
refilled
his
pipe
it
odd
he
continued
but
i
picked
up
copies
of
emerson
books
in
queer
places
not
so
strange
either
it
seems
the
natural
thing
to
find
loose
pages
of
his
essays
stuck
around
in
old
i
did
just
that
once
when
i
was
following
thoreau
trail
through
the
maine
woods
some
fellow
had
pinned
a
page
of
on
the
door
of
a
cabin
i
struck
one
night
when
it
was
mighty
good
to
find
shelter
the
pines
singing
snowstorm
coming
on
that
leaf
was
pretty
well
i
carried
it
off
with
me
and
had
it
framed
hangs
in
my
house
now
another
time
i
was
doing
california
on
horseback
and
in
an
abandoned
shack
in
the
sierras
i
found
emerson
an
old
copy
that
somebody
had
thumbed
a
good
deal
i
poked
it
out
of
some
rubbish
and
came
near
making
a
fire
of
it
left
it
though
for
the
next
fellow
i
noticed
that
if
one
thing
like
that
happens
to
you
there
bound
to
be
another
is
that
superstition
thatcher
i
not
superstitious
not
particularly
but
we
all
got
some
of
it
in
our
hides
after
that
second
time
it
was
away
back
in
the
seventies
when
i
was
preaching
for
a
spell
in
i
kept
looking
for
the
third
experience
that
i
felt
would
come
oh
of
course
it
did
come
cried
allen
eagerly
well
that
third
time
it
was
a
loose
leaf
torn
out
and
stuck
on
a
plank
or
just
an
old
book
it
was
a
copy
that
had
been
specially
bound
a
rare
piece
of
work
i
do
care
particularly
for
fine
bindings
but
that
had
been
done
with
taste
a
dark
green
the
color
you
get
looking
across
the
top
of
a
pine
wood
and
it
seemed
appropriate
emerson
would
have
liked
it
himself
the
stove
had
grown
red
hot
and
harwood
flung
open
the
door
the
glow
from
the
fire
fell
full
upon
the
dark
rugged
face
and
the
white
hair
of
the
minister
who
was
sitting
on
a
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
in
a
gray
flannel
shirt
he
looked
like
a
lumberman
of
the
north
an
unusual
tenderness
had
stolen
into
his
lean
face
that
was
a
long
while
after
that
ride
in
the
sierras
let
me
see
it
was
more
than
twenty
years
ago
i
ca
just
place
the
year
no
difference
i
gone
up
into
the
adirondacks
to
see
my
folks
i
told
you
about
our
farm
once
allen
not
far
from
john
brown
old
place
it
is
as
lonesome
up
there
now
as
it
was
when
i
was
a
boy
there
were
bully
places
to
hide
up
there
i
used
to
think
of
that
when
i
was
reading
scott
and
cooper
brown
could
have
hid
there
forever
if
he
got
out
of
virginia
after
the
raid
nowadays
there
are
too
many
hotels
and
people
go
canoeing
in
ironed
collars
no
good
my
folks
were
all
gone
even
then
and
strangers
lived
in
my
father
house
from
the
old
place
i
moved
along
walking
and
canoeing
it
stopped
on
saturday
in
a
settlement
where
there
was
a
church
that
had
been
preached
in
since
anybody
could
remember
preached
for
on
sunday
an
old
indian
died
while
i
was
there
and
i
baptized
and
buried
him
but
that
was
what
kept
me
there
was
a
young
woman
staying
at
the
small
where
i
stopped
place
run
by
a
man
and
his
wife
stranger
had
brought
her
there
early
in
the
summer
city
people
they
told
the
folks
they
came
from
new
york
they
were
young
folks
at
least
the
girl
was
the
man
had
gone
off
and
left
her
there
and
she
was
going
to
have
a
child
soon
and
was
terribly
ill
they
called
me
in
one
day
when
they
thought
the
woman
was
dying
the
country
doctor
was
much
good
an
old
fellow
who
did
know
that
anything
particular
had
happened
in
his
profession
since
harvey
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
i
struck
off
to
saranac
and
got
a
city
doctor
to
go
and
look
at
the
woman
nice
chap
he
was
too
he
stayed
there
till
the
troubles
were
over
daughter
born
and
everything
all
right
she
never
mentioned
the
man
who
had
left
her
there
would
answer
the
questions
and
did
tell
me
anything
either
strange
business
just
to
drop
in
on
a
thing
like
that
it
occurred
to
harwood
that
this
big
gray
kindly
man
had
probably
looked
upon
many
dark
pictures
in
his
life
the
minister
appeared
to
be
talking
half
to
himself
and
there
had
been
abrupt
pauses
in
his
characteristically
jerky
recital
there
was
a
long
silence
which
he
broke
by
striking
his
hands
together
abruptly
and
shaking
his
head
the
man
that
kept
the
was
scared
for
fear
the
woman
was
straight
did
like
the
idea
of
having
a
strange
girl
with
a
baby
left
on
his
hands
i
had
to
reason
some
with
that
fellow
but
his
wife
was
all
right
and
did
her
full
duty
by
the
girl
she
was
a
mighty
pretty
young
girl
and
she
took
her
troubles
whatever
they
were
like
what
you
call
a
true
sport
ed
thatcher
stretched
out
on
a
camp
bed
at
the
side
of
the
room
chewing
a
cigar
grunted
well
the
minister
continued
i
was
around
there
about
three
weeks
put
in
all
my
vacation
there
fact
is
i
hated
to
go
off
and
leave
that
girl
until
i
was
sure
i
could
do
anything
for
her
but
she
was
getting
out
of
the
woods
before
i
left
and
i
offered
to
help
her
any
way
i
could
she
did
seem
to
lack
for
money
a
couple
of
letters
with
money
came
for
her
but
did
seem
to
cheer
her
much
there
was
a
beast
in
the
jungle
no
doubt
of
that
but
she
was
taking
good
care
to
hide
him
did
seem
to
care
much
about
taking
care
of
herself
even
when
she
must
have
known
that
it
looked
bad
for
her
she
was
a
flighty
volatile
sort
of
creature
made
a
lot
of
what
i
done
for
her
in
bringing
over
the
doctor
that
doctor
was
a
brick
too
lots
of
good
people
in
the
world
boys
let
me
see
dan
feel
in
that
of
mine
on
the
nail
behind
you
and
you
find
the
book
i
started
to
tell
you
about
thanks
you
see
it
a
little
banged
up
because
carried
it
around
with
me
a
good
deal
and
so
on
but
acquired
tone
since
i
began
handling
it
the
green
in
that
leather
has
darkened
and
solitude
there
the
irony
of
fate
for
where
had
i
got
to
when
i
went
in
to
say
we
had
quite
a
talk
i
thought
maybe
there
was
some
message
i
could
carry
to
her
friends
for
her
but
she
was
game
and
would
hear
to
it
she
wanted
the
little
girl
baptized
but
said
she
had
decided
what
to
name
her
asked
me
if
i
could
baptize
a
baby
without
having
a
real
name
she
was
terribly
cut
up
and
cried
about
it
i
said
i
guessed
god
almighty
care
much
about
names
and
if
she
had
decided
on
one
i
name
the
baby
myself
and
i
did
i
named
the
little
girl
and
a
mighty
cute
youngster
she
was
too
i
named
her
elizabeth
favorite
name
of
mine
just
the
mother
lying
there
in
bed
and
the
man
and
woman
that
kept
the
in
the
room
the
mother
said
she
wanted
to
do
something
for
me
and
as
i
was
leaving
her
she
pulled
this
book
out
and
made
me
take
it
i
suppose
it
was
a
favorite
book
of
hers
and
all
that
suggested
dan
i
do
think
anybody
had
ever
opened
that
book
replied
ware
smiling
it
was
not
a
scratch
on
it
and
afterward
asked
allen
anxious
for
the
rest
of
the
story
well
sir
i
passed
through
there
four
years
afterward
and
found
the
same
people
living
in
the
little
cottage
there
at
that
settlement
strange
to
say
that
woman
had
stayed
there
a
couple
of
years
after
the
baby
was
born
had
any
place
to
go
i
reckon
nobody
ever
went
near
her
they
said
but
finally
she
picked
up
and
left
took
the
baby
with
her
she
had
never
been
well
afterward
and
finally
seeing
she
long
to
live
she
struck
out
for
home
wanted
to
die
among
her
own
people
maybe
i
do
know
the
rest
of
the
story
allen
what
i
told
you
is
all
i
know
it
like
finding
a
magazine
in
a
country
hotel
where
you
have
anything
to
read
and
dip
into
the
middle
of
a
serial
story
i
never
told
anybody
about
that
but
my
wife
i
had
a
feeling
that
if
that
woman
took
such
pains
to
bury
herself
up
there
in
the
wilderness
it
was
my
business
to
speak
of
it
but
it
long
ago
now
most
everything
that
an
old
chap
like
me
knows
is
thatcher
rose
and
crossed
to
the
stove
and
took
the
book
he
turned
it
over
and
scrutinized
it
carefully
scanned
the
blank
pages
and
the
lids
in
the
glow
from
the
stove
and
then
handed
it
to
allen
what
does
that
say
there
that
small
gold
print
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
that
the
binder
name
z
fenelsa
allen
closed
the
book
passed
his
hand
over
the
smooth
covers
and
handed
it
back
to
ware
what
did
you
say
the
woman
name
was
ware
asked
thatcher
did
say
but
the
name
she
went
by
up
there
was
forbes
she
told
me
it
was
an
assumed
name
the
people
she
stayed
with
told
me
they
never
knew
any
better
several
minutes
passed
in
which
no
one
spoke
the
minister
lapsed
into
one
of
his
deep
reveries
thatcher
stood
just
behind
him
peering
into
the
fire
suddenly
he
muttered
under
his
breath
and
almost
inaudibly
well
by
god
chapter
xxiv
a
washington
birthday
ball
the
bassetts
moved
to
the
capital
that
winter
arriving
with
the
phalanx
of
legislators
in
january
and
establishing
themselves
in
a
furnished
house
opportunely
vacated
by
the
bosworths
who
were
taking
the
mediterranean
trip
bassett
had
been
careful
to
announce
to
the
people
of
fraserville
that
the
removal
was
only
temporary
and
that
he
and
his
family
would
return
in
the
spring
but
marian
held
private
opinions
quite
at
variance
with
her
father
published
statements
bassett
acquiescence
had
been
due
to
owen
surprising
support
of
marian
plan
in
declaring
that
she
would
never
never
consent
to
live
in
a
flat
bassett
had
hoped
to
dispose
of
importunities
to
which
bassett
had
latterly
lent
mild
approval
when
however
owen
suggested
the
bosworth
house
which
could
be
occupied
with
the
minimum
of
domestic
vexation
bassett
promptly
consented
feeling
that
her
aunt
interest
might
conceal
a
desire
in
the
old
lady
breast
to
have
some
of
her
kinsfolk
near
her
bassett
had
not
allowed
her
husband
to
forget
the
dangerous
juxtaposition
of
sylvia
garrison
to
owen
that
girl
as
bassett
designated
sylvia
in
private
conversation
with
her
husband
had
been
planted
in
elizabeth
house
for
a
purpose
her
relief
that
sylvia
had
not
been
settled
in
the
delaware
street
residence
had
been
of
short
duration
bassett
saw
now
that
it
was
only
the
girl
adroit
method
of
impressing
upon
owen
her
humility
and
altruism
still
bassett
was
not
wholly
unhappy
it
was
something
to
be
near
at
hand
where
she
could
keep
track
of
sylvia
movements
and
the
social
scene
at
the
capital
was
not
without
its
interest
for
her
she
was
not
merely
the
wife
of
morton
bassett
but
the
only
child
of
the
late
blackford
singleton
sometime
senator
in
congress
she
was
moreover
the
niece
of
sally
owen
and
this
in
itself
was
a
social
asset
she
showed
her
husband
the
cards
that
were
left
at
their
door
and
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
representative
people
of
the
capital
were
looking
them
up
he
made
the
mistake
of
suggesting
that
the
husbands
of
most
of
the
women
who
had
called
had
axes
to
grind
at
the
state
house
a
suggestion
intended
to
be
humorous
but
she
answered
that
many
of
her
callers
were
old
friends
of
the
singletons
and
she
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
so
conduct
himself
as
to
adorn
less
frequently
the
newspaper
headlines
the
broad
advertisement
of
his
iniquities
would
be
so
much
worse
now
that
they
were
in
the
city
and
with
marian
future
to
consider
and
all
it
should
be
said
that
marian
arrival
had
not
gone
unheeded
the
society
columns
of
the
capital
welcomed
her
and
the
advertiser
reproduced
her
photograph
in
a
picture
hat
she
began
at
once
to
be
among
those
included
in
all
manner
of
functions
allen
danced
cheerfully
to
her
piping
and
she
still
telephoned
to
harwood
when
she
thought
of
ways
of
using
him
owen
had
declared
her
intention
of
giving
a
party
to
introduce
marian
to
the
society
of
the
capital
sally
owen
had
not
given
a
party
since
bassett
coming
out
but
she
brought
the
same
energy
and
thoroughness
to
bear
upon
a
social
affair
that
characterized
her
business
undertakings
in
preparing
the
list
in
itself
a
task
and
in
the
discussion
of
details
it
was
necessary
of
course
to
consult
marian
one
usually
heard
marian
views
whether
one
consulted
her
or
not
but
she
and
her
aunt
were
on
the
best
of
terms
and
owen
was
sincerely
anxious
to
satisfy
her
in
every
particular
on
half
a
dozen
evenings
allen
or
dan
brought
sylvia
to
the
delaware
street
house
to
meet
marian
and
plan
the
coming
event
no
one
would
have
imagined
from
the
zest
with
which
sylvia
discussed
such
deep
questions
as
the
employment
of
musicians
the
decorating
of
the
hall
the
german
favors
and
the
refreshments
that
she
had
been
at
work
all
day
in
a
schoolroom
that
had
been
built
before
ventilation
was
invented
when
sylvia
was
busy
she
was
the
busiest
of
mortals
but
when
she
threw
herself
heart
and
soul
into
play
it
was
with
the
completest
detachment
she
accomplished
wonderful
things
in
the
way
of
work
after
schoolhours
if
she
received
warning
that
either
of
her
faithful
knights
meditated
a
descent
upon
her
during
these
councils
of
war
to
plan
marian
belated
début
sylvia
might
snowball
allen
or
dan
or
both
of
them
all
the
way
from
elizabeth
house
to
owen
door
and
then
appear
demurely
before
that
amiable
soul
with
cheeks
aglow
and
dark
eyes
flashing
and
owen
would
say
this
ai
good
for
you
sylvia
it
seems
to
be
breaking
down
your
health
that
was
a
lively
quartette
sylvia
marian
allen
and
dan
dan
now
duly
sworn
to
serve
the
state
faithfully
as
a
legislator
had
been
placed
on
several
important
committees
and
a
busy
winter
stretched
before
him
morton
bassett
hand
lay
heavily
upon
the
legislature
the
young
man
had
never
realized
until
he
took
his
seat
in
the
lower
house
how
firmly
bassett
gripped
the
commonwealth
every
committee
appointment
in
both
houses
had
to
be
approved
by
the
senator
from
fraser
selection
as
chairman
of
the
committee
on
corporations
both
pleased
and
annoyed
him
he
would
have
liked
to
believe
himself
honestly
chosen
by
the
speaker
on
the
score
of
fitness
but
he
knew
well
enough
that
there
were
older
men
veteran
legislators
more
familiar
with
the
needs
and
dangers
who
had
a
better
right
to
the
honor
the
watchful
advertiser
had
not
overlooked
his
appointment
on
the
day
the
committees
were
announced
it
laid
before
its
readers
a
cartoon
depicting
bassett
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
senate
clutching
wires
that
radiated
to
every
seat
in
the
lower
house
one
desk
set
forth
conspicuously
in
the
foreground
was
inscribed
the
lion
and
daniel
was
the
tag
affixed
to
this
cartoon
which
caused
much
merriment
among
dan
friends
at
the
round
table
of
the
university
club
miss
bassett
début
was
fixed
for
washington
birthday
and
as
owen
house
had
no
ballroom
except
one
of
those
floored
attics
on
which
our
people
persist
in
bestowing
that
ambitious
title
she
decided
that
the
propylæum
alone
would
serve
pray
do
not
reach
for
your
dictionary
my
friend
no
matter
how
much
greek
may
have
survived
your
commencement
day
you
would
never
know
that
our
propylæum
reared
by
the
women
of
our
town
in
north
street
facing
the
pillared
façade
of
the
blind
institute
became
on
its
completion
in
the
centre
of
our
intellectual
and
social
life
the
club
papers
read
under
that
roof
constitute
a
literature
all
the
nobler
for
the
discretion
that
reserves
it
for
atrabilious
local
criticism
the
later
editions
of
our
have
danced
there
and
boxed
and
coxed
as
dramatic
club
stars
on
its
stage
billy
sumner
once
lectured
there
on
war
before
the
contemporary
club
to
say
nothing
of
james
appearance
herein
before
mentioned
which
left
us
filled
with
wildest
surmise
on
the
crest
of
a
new
and
ultimate
darien
nor
shall
i
omit
that
memorable
tea
to
the
chinese
lady
when
the
press
became
so
great
that
a
number
of
timorous
occidentals
in
their
best
bib
and
tucker
departed
with
all
possible
dignity
by
way
of
the
so
the
place
being
historic
as
things
go
in
a
new
country
owen
did
not
in
vulgar
parlance
hire
a
hall
but
gave
her
party
in
a
social
temple
of
loftiest
consecration
it
was
a
real
winter
night
with
a
snowstorm
and
the
jangle
of
outside
the
possibilities
of
a
hall
famed
for
its
many
brilliant
entertainments
had
never
been
more
fully
realized
than
on
this
night
of
marian
bassett
presentation
the
stage
was
screened
in
a
lattice
that
had
denuded
the
conservatories
of
newcastle
and
richmond
the
fireplace
was
a
bank
of
roses
and
the
walls
were
festooned
in
evergreens
nor
should
we
overlook
a
profile
of
the
father
of
his
country
in
white
carnations
on
a
green
background
with
all
the
effect
of
a
marble
a
fitting
embellishment
for
the
balcony
done
by
the
florist
from
allen
design
and
under
critical
eye
in
the
receiving
line
established
in
one
of
the
lower
parlors
were
owen
and
morton
bassett
the
governor
and
his
wife
he
happened
just
then
to
be
a
republican
colonel
and
vinning
retired
army
people
and
the
pick
of
the
last
october
brides
and
their
young
husbands
we
may
only
glance
hurriedly
at
the
throng
who
shook
owen
hand
and
were
presented
to
and
bassett
and
by
them
in
turn
to
their
daughter
every
one
remarked
how
stunning
the
hostess
looked
her
gown
was
white
and
in
the
latest
fashion
too
none
of
your
quaint
old
lace
and
lavender
for
aunt
sally
and
what
amusing
things
she
said
to
her
guests
as
they
filed
by
knowing
them
all
and
in
her
great
good
heart
loving
them
all
it
is
something
to
be
an
aunt
sally
where
the
name
is
a
synonym
for
perpetual
youth
and
perpetual
kindness
and
helpfulness
and
if
aunt
sally
did
live
just
a
little
way
down
my
own
street
and
if
she
had
bribed
me
not
to
put
her
in
a
book
with
a
gift
of
hams
from
her
greene
county
farm
last
christmas
there
are
many
more
things
i
should
like
to
say
of
her
since
the
little
affair
of
the
courier
morton
bassett
had
fought
shy
of
his
wife
aunt
but
he
stood
beside
her
enjoying
let
us
hope
the
grim
humor
of
his
juxtaposition
to
the
only
person
who
had
ever
blocked
any
of
his
enterprises
nothing
escaped
bassett
and
her
heart
softened
toward
her
politician
husband
as
she
saw
that
next
to
her
aunt
and
marian
a
daughter
to
be
proud
of
morton
bassett
was
the
person
most
observed
of
all
observers
she
noted
the
glances
bent
upon
him
by
the
strangers
to
whom
he
was
introduced
and
many
acquaintances
were
at
pains
to
recall
themselves
to
him
her
husband
was
a
presentable
man
anywhere
and
she
resolved
to
deal
more
leniently
with
his
offenses
in
future
the
governorship
or
a
seat
in
the
united
states
senate
would
amply
repay
her
for
the
heartaches
so
often
communicated
by
the
clipping
bureau
bassett
prided
herself
on
knowing
who
who
in
her
native
state
and
even
she
was
satisfied
that
the
gathering
was
representative
the
list
had
not
been
submitted
for
her
approval
if
it
had
been
she
might
have
deleted
certain
names
and
substituted
others
she
was
unable
for
example
to
justify
the
presence
of
the
senior
thatcher
though
her
husband
assured
her
in
a
tone
of
magnanimity
that
it
was
all
right
and
she
had
never
admired
colonel
ramsay
though
to
be
sure
nearly
every
one
else
did
was
not
the
colonel
handsome
courteous
genial
eloquent
worthy
of
all
admiration
owen
had
chosen
a
few
legislators
from
among
her
acquaintances
chiefly
gentlemen
who
had
gallantly
aided
some
of
her
measures
at
earlier
sessions
of
the
assembly
this
accounted
for
the
appearance
of
a
lone
prohibitionist
who
by
some
miracle
appeared
biennially
in
the
lower
house
and
for
a
prominent
labor
leader
whom
owen
liked
on
general
principles
the
statesman
who
has
already
loomed
darkly
in
these
pages
as
the
tallest
delegate
was
taller
than
ever
in
a
dress
coat
but
in
all
ways
a
citizen
of
whom
vermillion
county
had
reason
to
be
proud
john
ware
and
admiral
martin
finding
themselves
uncomfortable
in
the
crowd
rescued
thatcher
and
adjourned
with
him
to
a
room
set
apart
for
smokers
there
they
were
regarded
with
mild
condescension
by
young
gentlemen
who
rushed
in
from
the
dance
mopping
their
brows
and
inhaling
cigarettes
for
a
moment
wearing
the
melancholy
air
becoming
to
those
who
support
the
pillars
of
society
at
ten
the
receiving
line
had
dissolved
and
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
above
sylvia
had
volunteered
to
act
as
owen
adjutant
and
she
was
up
and
down
stairs
many
times
looking
after
countless
details
she
had
just
dispatched
allen
to
find
partners
for
some
girls
when
morton
bassett
accosted
her
in
the
hall
i
thirsty
miss
garrison
which
punch
bowl
do
you
recommend
to
a
man
of
my
temperate
habits
she
turned
to
the
table
and
took
a
glass
from
owen
butler
and
held
it
up
the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
that
one
is
pink
i
put
it
in
myself
your
health
and
long
life
to
marian
said
sylvia
i
going
to
take
this
chance
to
thank
you
for
your
kind
interest
in
marian
party
we
all
appreciate
it
even
if
you
did
do
it
for
us
but
for
owen
we
just
as
grateful
there
a
lot
of
work
in
carrying
off
an
affair
like
this
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
and
apparently
wished
to
prolong
the
talk
they
withdrew
out
of
the
current
of
people
passing
up
and
down
the
stairway
you
are
not
dancing
he
asked
no
i
not
here
socially
so
to
speak
i
not
going
out
you
know
i
only
wanted
to
help
owen
a
little
pardon
me
i
had
really
forgotten
you
are
a
busy
person
marian
tells
me
you
have
begun
your
teaching
you
do
show
any
evidences
of
wear
oh
i
never
was
so
well
in
my
life
you
will
pardon
me
for
mentioning
it
here
but
but
i
was
sorry
to
hear
from
harwood
that
the
teaching
is
necessary
he
was
quite
right
she
thought
in
saying
that
the
time
and
place
were
to
such
a
remark
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
she
noticed
that
his
lids
drooped
wearily
he
seemed
content
to
linger
there
where
they
caught
fitfully
glimpses
of
marian
bright
happy
face
in
the
dance
owen
and
bassett
were
sitting
in
a
group
of
dowagers
at
the
other
end
of
the
ballroom
identifying
and
commenting
upon
the
season
débutantes
i
suppose
you
are
very
busy
now
sylvia
remarked
yes
this
will
be
a
busy
session
and
i
suppose
you
have
more
to
do
than
the
others
it
the
penalty
of
leadership
he
flushed
at
the
compliment
changed
his
position
slightly
and
avoided
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
detected
in
him
something
that
had
escaped
her
before
it
might
not
be
weariness
after
all
that
prompted
him
to
lean
against
the
wall
with
one
hand
carelessly
thrust
into
his
pocket
he
was
not
a
man
to
show
physical
weariness
it
seemed
rather
a
stolid
indifference
either
to
the
immediate
scene
or
to
more
serious
matters
their
meeting
had
seemed
accidental
she
could
not
believe
he
had
contrived
it
if
the
dance
bored
him
she
was
by
no
means
his
only
refuge
many
present
would
have
thought
themselves
highly
favored
by
a
word
from
him
a
messenger
brought
sylvia
a
question
from
owen
in
turning
away
to
answer
she
gave
him
a
chance
to
escape
but
he
waited
and
when
she
was
free
again
she
felt
that
he
had
been
watching
her
he
smiled
and
stood
erect
as
though
impelled
by
an
agreeable
thought
we
do
meet
very
often
miss
garrison
and
this
is
hardly
the
place
for
long
conversations
you
busy
too
but
i
like
to
ask
you
something
certainly
mr
bassett
the
newest
struck
up
and
she
swung
her
head
for
a
moment
in
time
to
it
and
looked
out
upon
the
swaying
forms
of
the
dancers
that
marian
favorite
she
said
that
afternoon
after
the
convention
you
remember
of
course
bassett
i
remember
perfectly
you
laughed
they
both
smiled
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
now
as
then
it
was
a
smile
of
understanding
a
curious
reciprocal
exchange
that
sufficed
without
elucidation
in
words
well
said
sylvia
would
you
mind
telling
me
just
why
you
laughed
oh
that
would
be
telling
a
lot
of
things
any
one
seeing
them
might
have
thought
that
this
gentleman
was
taking
advantage
of
an
opportunity
to
bask
in
the
smile
of
a
pretty
girl
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
her
company
he
was
purposely
detaining
her
but
whether
from
a
wish
to
amuse
himself
or
to
mark
his
indifference
to
what
went
on
around
him
she
did
not
fathom
the
fact
was
that
sylvia
had
wondered
herself
a
good
deal
about
that
interview
in
owen
house
and
she
was
not
quite
sure
why
she
had
laughed
i
really
like
to
know
miss
garrison
if
i
knew
why
you
laughed
at
me
oh
i
did
laugh
at
you
at
least
it
was
just
you
alone
i
was
laughing
at
not
at
me
his
look
of
indifference
vanished
wholly
he
seemed
sincerely
interested
as
he
waited
for
her
reply
delayed
a
moment
by
the
passing
of
a
group
of
youngsters
from
the
ballroom
to
the
fresher
air
of
the
hall
i
know
perfectly
well
this
is
a
good
place
to
be
serious
in
but
i
laughed
do
you
really
want
to
know
yes
please
do
try
to
spare
my
feelings
they
pretty
badly
shot
up
anyhow
it
must
have
been
because
it
struck
me
as
funny
that
a
man
like
you
with
all
your
influence
and
power
your
capacity
for
doing
big
things
should
go
to
so
much
trouble
merely
to
show
another
man
your
contempt
for
him
just
a
moment
she
deliberated
an
instant
lifting
her
head
a
trifle
it
was
funny
just
as
it
would
be
funny
if
the
united
states
went
to
war
to
crush
a
petty
ignorant
pauper
power
or
it
would
be
like
using
the
biggest
pile
driver
to
smash
a
mosquito
it
was
ridiculous
just
because
it
seemed
so
unnecessarily
elaborate
such
a
waste
of
steam
she
had
spoken
earnestly
and
quickly
but
he
laughed
to
assure
her
that
he
was
not
offended
so
that
was
it
was
it
i
think
so
something
like
that
and
you
laughed
too
that
day
yes
why
did
i
laugh
he
demanded
because
you
knew
it
was
grotesque
and
not
to
be
taken
at
all
seriously
as
people
did
take
it
and
then
maybe
maybe
i
thought
it
funny
that
you
should
have
employed
harwood
to
pull
the
lever
that
sent
the
big
hammer
smashing
down
on
the
insect
so
that
was
it
well
maybe
it
was
so
unnecessary
after
all
to
be
frank
i
did
think
so
in
my
conceit
i
thought
it
a
good
stroke
that
a
secret
nobody
else
knows
that
why
should
i
have
used
harwood
assuming
that
i
did
use
him
can
you
stand
any
more
sha
we
talk
of
something
else
their
colloquy
had
been
longer
than
sylvia
found
comfortable
every
one
knew
bassett
every
one
did
not
know
her
she
was
a
comparative
stranger
in
the
city
and
it
was
not
wholly
kind
in
him
to
make
her
conspicuous
yet
he
seemed
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
you
cast
an
excellent
actor
for
an
unworthy
part
that
all
i
was
debasing
him
is
that
what
you
think
he
persisted
yes
she
answered
steadily
meeting
his
eyes
you
like
him
you
believe
in
him
he
has
ability
she
answered
guardedly
then
i
done
nothing
to
thwart
him
in
the
use
of
it
he
the
best
advertised
young
man
in
the
state
in
either
political
party
he
in
a
place
now
where
he
can
make
good
his
smile
was
grave
it
was
impossible
to
answer
him
in
the
key
of
social
small
talk
the
seems
to
think
that
he
in
the
legislature
to
do
what
you
tell
him
to
he
does
have
to
do
it
does
he
he
owes
me
nothing
absolutely
nothing
he
can
kick
me
down
stairs
if
he
wants
to
it
was
understood
when
he
came
into
my
office
that
he
should
be
free
to
quit
me
whenever
he
liked
i
like
you
to
know
that
she
was
embarrassed
by
the
direct
look
that
accompanied
this
her
opinions
could
not
interest
him
one
way
or
another
and
he
was
going
far
in
assuming
that
she
was
deeply
concerned
in
harwood
welfare
the
incongruity
of
their
talk
was
emphasized
by
the
languorous
strains
of
the
newest
popular
waltz
that
floated
over
them
from
the
ballroom
if
it
were
any
of
my
affair
which
it
certainly
is
i
should
tell
him
to
stand
by
you
to
say
no
to
you
if
need
be
and
yet
remain
your
friend
you
think
then
that
i
am
not
beyond
reclamation
that
i
might
be
saved
pulled
out
of
the
mire
no
man
is
beyond
reclamation
is
he
i
think
not
i
believe
not
the
music
ceased
the
dancers
were
demanding
a
repetition
of
the
number
bassett
stood
his
ground
stubbornly
well
i
asked
him
to
do
something
for
me
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
asked
him
to
do
that
was
straight
there
was
no
evading
this
she
wondered
whether
he
had
deliberately
planned
this
talk
and
what
it
was
leading
to
in
any
view
it
was
inexplicable
his
brow
knit
and
there
was
a
curious
gravity
in
his
eyes
as
they
sought
hers
searchingly
that
his
affair
entirely
bassett
she
replied
coldly
he
and
i
are
good
friends
and
of
course
i
should
hate
to
see
him
make
a
mistake
but
the
mistake
may
be
mine
let
us
say
that
it
is
mine
i
had
an
idea
that
you
did
make
mistakes
why
should
you
make
the
serious
mistake
of
asking
a
good
man
to
do
a
bad
thing
the
natural
inference
would
be
that
i
a
bad
man
would
it
it
would
be
my
way
of
looking
at
it
all
you
need
is
courage
to
be
a
great
man
you
can
go
far
he
smiled
grimly
i
need
only
one
thing
you
say
but
what
if
it
the
thing
i
got
get
it
she
replied
lightly
but
your
defiance
in
the
convention
was
worthy
of
you
it
was
only
a
piece
of
bravado
you
do
deserve
to
be
abused
for
that
just
scolded
a
little
that
why
i
laughed
at
you
that
afternoon
i
going
to
laugh
at
you
now
the
music
had
ceased
again
and
allen
and
marian
flashed
out
upon
them
in
the
highest
spirits
well
i
like
this
cried
marian
what
are
you
two
talking
so
long
about
oh
i
saw
you
through
three
dances
at
least
miss
garrison
has
been
laughing
at
me
said
bassett
smiling
at
his
daughter
she
does
take
me
at
all
seriously
or
too
seriously
i
do
know
which
how
could
she
take
you
seriously
demanded
marian
i
never
do
sylvia
where
on
earth
is
our
little
daniel
it
nearly
time
for
the
cotillion
and
if
dan
harwood
does
show
up
for
that
i
never
forgive
him
in
this
world
the
cotillion
repeated
bassett
glancing
at
his
watch
has
dan
got
here
yet
he
had
a
committee
meeting
but
it
ought
to
have
been
over
before
now
sylvia
noted
that
the
serious
look
came
into
his
eyes
again
for
an
instant
he
ought
to
have
had
a
committe
meeting
on
the
night
of
my
party
and
it
a
holiday
too
and
after
all
the
rehearsing
we
done
at
aunt
sally
the
figure
absolutely
has
to
have
him
said
allen
maybe
i
better
send
a
scout
to
look
him
up
or
run
over
to
the
state
house
myself
oh
he
be
here
murmured
sylvia
dan
had
undoubtedly
intended
to
appear
early
at
the
dance
and
she
wondered
whether
his
delay
might
not
be
due
to
the
crisis
in
his
relations
with
bassett
of
which
the
politician
had
hinted
as
she
ran
off
with
allen
to
make
sure
the
apparatus
for
the
german
was
in
order
she
wished
bassett
had
not
spoken
to
her
of
harwood
sylvia
and
allen
had
despaired
of
dan
when
at
a
quarter
of
twelve
he
appeared
he
met
their
reproaches
cheerfully
and
airily
explained
his
delay
state
business
can
you
imagine
me
fresh
from
richelieu
cabinet
with
a
trail
of
dead
horses
on
the
road
behind
me
in
plain
prose
i
did
get
home
to
dress
until
eleven
and
the
snow
makes
it
hard
going
he
had
dressed
with
care
nevertheless
and
had
never
looked
better
sylvia
sent
allen
ahead
to
begin
clearing
the
floor
for
the
cotillion
and
followed
more
slowly
with
harwood
i
suppose
he
remarked
half
to
himself
that
i
really
ought
to
do
it
what
you
hesitate
now
after
keeping
the
stage
waiting
it
may
be
a
case
for
an
understudy
there
are
reasons
why
then
you
have
done
it
they
were
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
and
sylvia
paused
he
was
conscious
of
a
quick
catch
in
her
breath
her
eyes
met
his
for
an
instant
searchingly
yes
i
have
done
it
he
answered
and
looked
at
her
wonderingly
a
moment
later
he
had
made
his
peace
with
owen
and
paid
his
compliments
to
bassett
at
the
favor
table
heaped
high
with
beribboned
hatchets
and
bunches
of
cherries
for
the
first
figure
morton
bassett
had
heard
praise
of
his
daughter
from
many
lips
but
he
watched
her
joyous
course
through
the
figure
in
the
german
with
an
attention
that
was
not
wholly
attributable
to
fatherly
pride
harwood
hand
led
her
hither
and
thither
through
the
intricate
maze
one
must
have
been
sadly
lacking
in
the
pictorial
sense
not
to
have
experienced
a
thrill
of
delight
in
a
scene
so
animate
with
grace
so
touched
with
color
it
was
ungracious
to
question
the
sincerity
of
those
who
pronounced
marian
the
belle
of
the
ball
when
colonel
ramsay
the
supreme
authority
in
hoosier
pulchritude
declared
her
to
be
the
fairest
rose
in
a
of
girls
he
said
the
same
thing
to
the
adoring
parents
of
a
dozen
other
girls
that
night
the
colonel
was
born
in
tecumseh
county
on
our
side
of
the
ohio
and
just
plays
at
being
a
kentuckian
mothers
of
daughters
watching
the
dance
with
a
jealous
eye
on
their
own
offspring
whispered
among
themselves
that
as
likely
as
not
marian
tall
cavalier
was
the
man
chosen
of
all
time
to
be
her
husband
he
was
her
confidential
man
and
nothing
could
stay
his
upward
course
bassett
saw
it
all
and
guessed
what
they
were
thinking
sylvia
flashed
across
his
vision
now
and
then
he
overheard
people
asking
who
she
was
and
he
caught
the
answers
that
she
was
a
girl
owen
had
taken
up
a
public
they
believed
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
sylvia
quite
unconscious
of
this
interest
saw
that
the
figures
she
had
done
so
much
toward
planning
were
enacted
without
a
hitch
the
last
one
the
pergola
with
real
roses
if
you
must
know
well
deserved
colonel
ramsay
compliment
you
ca
tell
said
the
colonel
in
his
best
manner
where
the
roses
end
and
the
girls
begin
it
was
two
when
harwood
after
taking
owen
down
to
supper
found
himself
free
he
met
thatcher
in
the
lower
hall
muffled
in
astrakhan
and
swearing
softly
to
himself
because
his
carriage
had
been
lost
in
the
blizzard
well
how
are
things
going
with
you
young
man
right
enough
i
tired
and
it
about
for
me
have
got
house
bill
in
your
pockets
have
you
asked
thatcher
with
a
grin
a
reporter
for
the
was
in
here
looking
for
you
a
minute
ago
he
said
your
committee
had
taken
a
vote
and
he
wanted
to
know
about
it
told
him
you
gone
home
hope
you
appreciate
that
i
used
to
lying
to
reporters
you
see
my
son
i
ai
in
that
deal
you
understand
that
bill
was
fixed
up
in
chicago
and
every
corporation
lawyer
that
does
business
in
the
old
hoosier
state
has
his
eye
on
it
i
not
asking
any
questions
lord
no
it
up
to
you
grand
party
that
a
nice
girl
of
bassett
my
wagon
here
all
right
dan
bassett
harwood
turned
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
bassett
who
was
loitering
aimlessly
about
the
hall
sir
he
said
and
they
shook
hands
mechanically
how
are
you
party
about
over
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
bassett
it
need
take
but
a
minute
better
now
if
it
important
replied
bassett
carelessly
we
voted
on
house
bill
in
committee
the
majority
report
will
be
against
it
so
what
was
the
matter
with
it
it
crooked
that
all
i
would
stand
for
it
two
members
were
willing
to
support
it
and
there
will
be
a
minority
report
it
that
same
bill
that
was
jumped
on
so
hard
at
the
last
session
only
it
been
given
a
fresh
coat
of
paint
it
seems
to
have
taken
you
several
weeks
to
find
that
out
nothing
wrong
with
that
bill
it
merely
frames
a
natural
and
reasonable
right
into
a
statute
those
labor
cranks
at
the
state
house
have
been
trying
to
scare
you
no
sir
that
thing
dead
wrong
you
not
only
know
it
wrong
but
you
misled
me
about
it
that
public
benefit
clause
is
put
in
there
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
it
makes
possible
the
very
combination
and
absorption
of
industries
that
the
party
is
pledged
to
fight
i
have
bawled
against
those
things
in
every
county
in
indiana
bassett
nodded
but
showed
no
irritation
his
manner
irritated
harwood
the
younger
man
lips
twitched
slightly
as
he
continued
and
the
fact
that
you
were
behind
it
has
leaked
out
the
is
on
to
it
and
is
going
to
go
after
it
house
bill
is
an
outrage
on
the
party
honor
and
an
affront
to
the
intelligence
of
the
people
and
moreover
your
interest
in
having
me
made
chairman
of
the
committee
that
had
to
pass
on
it
does
look
good
well
sir
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
not
particularly
interested
in
that
bill
but
a
lot
of
our
friends
are
behind
it
and
we
got
to
take
care
of
our
friends
said
bassett
without
raising
his
voice
their
relations
were
practically
at
an
end
and
bassett
did
not
care
but
dan
felt
the
wrench
he
felt
it
the
more
keenly
because
of
impassiveness
at
this
moment
of
parting
you
been
a
kind
friend
to
me
sir
you
bassett
laid
his
hand
with
an
abrupt
gesture
upon
harwood
arm
and
smiled
a
curious
mirthless
smile
none
of
that
i
told
you
when
the
time
came
for
you
to
go
you
need
shed
no
tears
at
the
parting
remember
you
do
owe
me
anything
quits
i
hoped
you
would
see
it
just
this
way
that
you
would
realize
the
danger
of
that
bill
to
the
party
to
yourself
you
can
score
heavily
by
showing
up
the
bill
for
what
you
think
it
is
go
ahead
it
your
chance
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
he
folded
his
white
gloves
and
put
them
away
carefully
in
his
breast
pocket
sir
harwood
the
dancing
continued
above
owen
insisted
on
seeing
her
last
guest
depart
but
begged
harwood
to
take
sylvia
home
at
once
as
they
left
a
few
minutes
later
dan
caught
a
glimpse
of
bassett
sitting
alone
in
the
on
the
way
to
elizabeth
house
dan
told
sylvia
what
had
happened
the
carriage
plunged
roughly
through
the
drifting
snow
sleet
drove
sharply
against
the
windows
he
lied
to
me
about
it
and
i
thought
that
with
all
his
faults
he
would
play
square
with
me
the
whole
corporation
lobby
is
back
of
the
bill
i
was
stupid
not
to
have
seen
it
earlier
i
been
a
dull
ass
about
a
lot
of
things
but
it
over
now
i
done
with
him
i
glad
glad
you
met
it
squarely
and
glad
that
you
settled
it
quickly
i
glad
she
repeated
slowly
but
i
sorry
too
sorry
oh
i
so
sorry
for
him
chapter
xxv
the
lady
of
the
daguerreotype
daniel
does
seem
to
be
coming
remarked
owen
he
hardly
ever
misses
a
sunday
afternoon
he
working
hard
i
had
no
idea
legislators
had
to
work
so
hard
said
sylvia
they
sat
in
owen
office
which
was
cosier
than
the
and
the
place
where
she
seemed
most
comfortable
since
we
looked
at
her
desk
last
a
has
been
added
to
its
furniture
and
on
it
hang
impaled
a
few
cuttings
from
agricultural
newspapers
the
content
of
these
clippings
will
ultimately
reach
the
courier
readers
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
as
owen
and
atwill
now
understand
each
other
perfectly
it
was
the
first
sunday
in
march
and
a
blustery
day
with
rain
and
sleet
alternating
at
the
windows
and
an
impudent
wind
whistling
in
the
chimneys
hickory
logs
snapped
pleasantly
in
the
small
fireplace
that
was
a
feature
of
the
room
sylvia
had
dined
with
her
friend
and
the
day
being
of
the
sort
that
encourages
confidences
they
had
prolonged
their
talk
when
did
you
see
daniel
last
asked
owen
casually
last
night
replied
sylvia
meeting
her
friend
eyes
easily
he
dropped
in
for
a
little
while
he
wanted
to
talk
about
his
stand
on
that
corporation
bill
well
he
and
morton
have
broken
up
housekeeping
daniel
has
climbed
on
to
the
other
side
of
the
breastworks
sylvia
smiled
yes
that
about
it
but
i
think
he
has
acted
quite
finely
about
it
you
mean
he
did
jump
on
morton
as
he
might
have
done
did
make
a
grand
stand
play
of
it
yes
he
might
have
made
capital
for
himself
out
of
the
corporation
bill
but
he
did
he
made
his
report
without
bringing
personalities
into
it
and
the
bill
was
passed
over
the
governor
veto
that
was
morton
way
of
showing
that
he
did
need
daniel
very
likely
i
rather
glad
it
happened
that
way
glad
daniel
got
a
licking
oh
not
just
that
but
it
shows
him
that
if
he
going
to
be
the
people
champion
he
will
have
to
be
unhorsed
pretty
often
if
all
these
things
could
be
accomplished
easily
there
would
be
any
glory
in
success
it
not
an
easy
thing
to
drive
a
man
like
bassett
out
of
politics
or
even
to
defeat
the
dangerous
measures
he
introduces
in
the
legislature
if
it
were
easy
to
get
rid
of
them
such
men
would
last
long
besides
i
a
little
afraid
it
was
half
so
much
patriotism
that
was
involved
as
it
was
his
vanity
he
was
bitter
because
he
found
that
bassett
had
deceived
him
and
was
trying
to
use
him
but
in
view
of
bassett
many
kindnesses
to
him
he
would
make
a
personal
matter
of
it
in
the
house
dan
opposition
was
based
on
legal
defects
in
that
bill
points
that
were
over
the
heads
of
most
of
the
legislators
but
he
is
now
determined
to
keep
up
the
fight
he
finds
that
bassett
is
quite
able
to
do
as
he
pleases
even
without
his
services
he
felt
that
he
dealt
with
him
magnanimously
in
keeping
his
antagonism
to
the
corporation
bill
on
the
high
plane
of
its
legal
unsoundness
bassett
ignored
this
and
merely
secured
the
passage
of
the
bill
by
marshaling
all
the
votes
he
needed
in
both
parties
that
a
new
scheme
they
say
morton
has
introduced
into
indiana
this
getting
men
on
both
sides
to
vote
for
one
of
these
bad
bills
that
shuts
up
the
party
newspapers
and
neither
side
can
use
that
particular
thing
as
ammunition
at
the
next
election
instead
of
talking
about
house
bill
in
the
next
campaign
they
will
howl
about
the
tariff
on
champagne
or
pensions
for
veterans
of
the
black
hawk
war
they
all
tarred
with
the
same
stick
and
do
dare
call
attention
to
the
other
fellow
daniel
had
better
get
out
of
politics
she
ended
leadingly
please
no
he
better
stay
in
and
learn
how
to
make
himself
count
so
far
as
bassett
is
concerned
i
think
that
for
some
reason
he
had
gone
as
far
with
dan
as
he
cared
to
i
think
he
was
prepared
for
the
break
owen
was
wiping
her
spectacles
on
a
piece
of
chamois
skin
she
kept
in
her
desk
for
the
purpose
and
she
concluded
this
rite
with
unusual
deliberation
how
do
you
figure
that
out
sylvia
this
must
be
confidential
aunt
sally
i
have
said
nothing
to
dan
about
it
but
the
night
of
your
party
bassett
was
in
a
curious
frame
of
mind
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
particularly
cheerful
i
thought
morton
had
as
good
a
time
as
anybody
superficially
yes
but
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
in
the
hall
after
the
dancing
had
begun
i
think
in
spite
of
his
apparent
indifference
to
the
constant
fire
of
his
enemies
it
has
had
an
effect
on
him
hardened
or
if
he
was
always
hard
he
does
care
any
longer
whether
he
wears
the
velvet
glove
or
not
that
attack
on
thatcher
in
the
convention
illustrates
what
i
mean
his
is
as
complete
as
most
people
seem
to
think
it
is
he
lets
go
of
himself
like
a
petulant
child
that
must
be
a
new
development
in
him
it
does
chime
with
the
other
things
you
hear
of
him
as
a
shrewd
calculating
manager
who
strikes
his
enemies
in
the
dark
he
was
in
an
evil
humor
that
night
or
he
would
have
talked
to
me
as
he
did
he
was
ugly
and
vindictive
he
was
not
only
glad
he
had
put
dan
in
the
way
of
temptation
but
he
wanted
me
to
know
that
he
had
done
it
he
seemed
to
be
setting
his
back
to
the
wall
and
daring
the
world
well
well
said
owen
morton
has
seemed
a
little
uneasy
lately
but
there
do
seem
to
be
any
reason
why
he
should
have
picked
you
out
to
jump
on
you
never
did
anything
to
morton
yes
said
sylvia
smiling
i
laughed
at
him
once
i
laughed
at
him
about
the
way
he
had
treated
thatcher
we
stopped
right
there
with
the
laugh
he
laughed
too
you
know
and
he
took
that
up
again
at
the
party
and
i
had
to
explain
what
my
laugh
meant
oh
you
explained
it
did
you
and
sylvia
recounted
the
interview
i
guess
morton
has
been
laughed
at
much
and
that
was
why
he
remembered
it
and
wanted
to
talk
to
you
again
i
suspect
that
hallie
scolds
him
when
she
does
pet
him
most
folks
are
afraid
of
morton
that
why
he
could
take
care
of
that
corporation
bill
with
the
jumping
him
the
way
it
did
well
well
that
must
have
been
quite
a
day
for
morton
you
laughed
at
him
and
when
the
rest
of
you
went
off
in
allen
automobile
that
night
i
ran
the
harrow
over
him
a
few
times
myself
well
well
owen
smiled
as
though
recalling
an
agreeable
experience
as
long
as
there
are
old
stumps
in
a
field
that
you
must
plough
around
i
got
much
use
for
the
land
when
the
corn
comes
up
you
do
see
the
stumps
just
sitting
on
the
fence
and
looking
over
the
scenery
but
when
you
go
to
put
the
plow
through
again
your
same
old
stumps
loom
up
again
solider
than
ever
i
guess
daniel
will
come
out
all
right
he
was
raised
on
a
farm
and
ought
to
know
how
to
drive
a
straight
furrow
by
the
way
they
telephoned
me
from
elizabeth
house
last
night
that
a
vacant
room
there
who
moved
out
owen
always
prolonged
the
e
of
elizabeth
and
never
referred
to
the
house
except
by
its
full
title
rose
farrell
has
left
went
unexpectedly
i
think
i
did
know
she
was
going
let
me
see
she
that
girl
that
worked
for
morton
and
daniel
she
leaving
for
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
get
her
back
replied
sylvia
evasively
why
rose
has
been
at
elizabeth
house
for
two
years
and
under
the
rules
she
can
stay
a
year
longer
she
ai
getting
married
is
she
i
think
not
replied
sylvia
i
going
to
look
her
up
and
get
her
back
if
possible
you
do
that
sylvia
it
ai
just
your
place
but
i
be
glad
if
you
see
what
the
matter
we
do
want
to
lose
a
girl
if
we
can
help
it
owen
rose
and
transferred
a
pile
of
paperbound
books
from
a
shelf
to
her
desk
sylvia
recognized
these
as
college
catalogues
and
noted
bits
of
paper
thrust
into
the
leaves
as
markers
i
been
looking
into
this
business
some
since
we
went
down
to
college
i
had
a
lot
of
these
schools
send
me
their
catalogues
and
they
mighty
interesting
though
a
good
deal
of
it
i
do
understand
sylvia
sylvia
never
heard
her
name
drawled
as
owen
spoke
it
without
a
thrill
of
expectancy
sylvia
there
a
lot
of
books
being
written
and
pieces
in
the
magazines
all
the
time
about
women
and
what
we
have
done
or
ca
do
what
do
you
suppose
it
all
leading
up
to
that
question
is
bigger
than
i
am
aunt
sally
but
i
think
the
conditions
that
have
thrown
women
out
into
the
world
as
are
forcing
one
thing
just
one
thing
that
is
more
important
now
than
any
other
it
all
summed
up
in
the
word
efficiency
efficiency
owen
reached
for
the
poker
and
readjusted
the
logs
she
watched
the
resulting
sparks
for
a
moment
then
settled
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
repeated
sylvia
word
again
you
mean
that
a
woman
has
got
to
learn
how
to
make
her
jelly
jell
is
that
your
notion
exactly
that
she
must
learn
not
to
waste
her
strokes
any
scheme
of
education
for
woman
that
leaves
that
out
works
an
injury
if
women
are
to
be
a
permanent
part
of
the
army
of
americans
they
must
learn
to
get
full
value
from
their
minds
or
hands
either
one
it
the
same
the
trouble
with
us
women
is
that
there
a
lot
of
the
old
mediæval
taint
in
us
mediæval
say
that
some
other
way
sylvia
i
mean
that
we
still
crippled
we
women
by
the
long
years
in
which
nothing
was
expected
of
us
but
to
sit
in
casements
and
work
embroidery
while
our
lords
went
out
to
fight
or
thrummed
the
lute
under
our
windows
well
there
was
joan
of
arc
she
delivered
the
goods
to
be
sure
she
does
rather
light
up
her
time
does
she
laughed
sylvia
sylvia
the
day
i
first
saw
a
woman
hammer
a
typewriter
in
a
office
i
thought
the
end
had
come
it
seemed
as
the
saying
is
nater
and
i
reckon
it
was
nowadays
these
buildings
downtown
are
full
of
women
at
noontime
washington
street
is
crowded
with
girls
who
work
in
offices
and
shops
they
do
get
much
pay
for
it
either
most
of
those
girls
would
a
lot
rather
work
in
an
office
or
stand
behind
a
counter
than
stay
at
home
and
help
their
mothers
bake
and
scrub
and
wash
and
iron
these
same
girls
used
to
do
just
that
help
their
mothers
coming
downtown
about
once
a
month
or
when
there
was
a
circus
procession
and
having
for
company
some
young
who
took
them
to
church
or
to
a
thanksgiving
matinée
and
who
probably
married
them
some
day
a
girl
who
did
marry
took
in
sewing
for
the
neighbors
and
as
like
as
not
went
to
live
with
her
married
sister
and
looked
after
her
babies
i
seen
all
these
things
change
nowadays
girls
have
got
to
have
excitement
they
like
spending
their
days
in
the
big
buildings
the
men
in
the
offices
jolly
them
the
men
bookkeepers
and
clerks
seem
a
lot
nicer
than
the
mechanics
that
live
out
in
their
neighborhood
when
they
ai
busy
they
loaf
in
the
halls
of
the
buildings
flirting
or
reading
novels
and
talking
to
their
bosses
callers
they
do
have
to
soil
their
hands
and
you
can
dress
a
girl
up
in
a
skirt
and
so
she
looks
pretty
decent
for
about
two
weeks
of
her
wages
they
care
much
about
getting
married
unless
they
can
strike
some
fellow
with
an
automobile
who
can
buy
them
better
clothes
than
they
can
buy
themselves
what
they
hanker
for
is
a
flat
or
where
they
wo
have
any
housekeeping
to
do
housekeeping
their
notions
of
housekeeping
do
go
beyond
boiling
an
egg
on
a
gas
range
and
opening
up
a
sofa
to
sleep
on
you
an
educated
woman
sylvia
what
going
to
come
of
all
this
it
is
just
the
fault
of
the
girls
that
they
do
this
is
it
near
my
there
are
girls
who
stay
at
home
with
their
mothers
and
many
of
them
are
without
any
ambition
of
any
kind
i
a
good
deal
for
the
girl
who
wants
to
strike
out
for
herself
the
household
arts
as
you
knew
them
in
your
youth
ca
be
practised
in
the
home
any
more
on
the
income
of
the
average
man
most
women
of
the
kind
we
talking
about
wear
clothes
not
because
they
lazy
but
because
the
suits
which
life
in
a
city
demands
ca
be
made
by
any
amateur
sempstress
they
turned
out
by
the
carload
in
great
factories
from
designs
of
experts
there
no
bread
to
bake
in
the
modern
mechanic
home
for
better
bread
and
cake
are
made
more
cheaply
in
the
modern
bakeshop
was
there
really
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
about
the
pies
that
mother
used
to
make
i
wonder
there
were
perhaps
in
every
community
women
who
were
natural
cooks
but
our
mary
used
to
drive
grandfather
crazy
with
her
saleratus
biscuits
and
greasy
doughnuts
a
good
cook
in
the
old
times
was
famous
all
over
the
community
because
the
general
level
of
cooking
was
so
low
women
used
to
take
great
pride
in
their
preservings
and
jellyings
but
at
the
present
prices
of
fruit
and
sugar
a
city
woman
would
lose
money
making
such
things
it
largely
because
this
work
ca
be
done
at
home
that
girls
such
as
we
have
at
elizabeth
house
have
no
sort
of
manual
dexterity
and
have
to
earn
a
poor
living
doing
something
badly
that
they
not
interested
in
or
fitted
for
women
have
one
terrible
handicap
in
going
out
into
the
world
to
earn
their
living
it
the
eternal
romance
that
in
all
of
us
said
sylvia
a
little
dreamily
i
do
believe
any
woman
ever
gets
beyond
that
it
was
a
note
she
rarely
struck
and
owen
looked
at
her
quickly
i
mean
the
man
who
may
be
always
waiting
just
around
the
corner
you
mean
every
girl
has
that
chance
before
her
well
a
happy
marriage
is
a
great
thing
the
greatest
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
woman
my
married
life
was
a
happy
one
very
happy
but
it
did
last
long
it
was
my
misfortune
to
lose
my
husband
and
the
little
girl
when
i
was
still
young
they
think
i
hard
yes
a
good
many
people
do
because
i
been
making
money
but
i
had
to
do
something
i
could
sit
with
my
hands
folded
and
what
i
done
i
tried
to
do
right
i
hope
you
wo
leave
love
and
marriage
out
of
your
life
sylvia
in
this
new
condition
of
things
that
we
talked
about
there
no
reason
why
a
woman
should
work
do
things
climb
up
high
and
be
a
woman
too
he
be
a
lucky
man
who
gets
you
to
stand
by
him
and
work
for
him
and
with
him
oh
sighed
sylvia
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
i
want
to
know
so
much
and
do
so
much
you
know
them
and
do
them
but
i
do
want
you
to
have
a
life
dear
sylvia
and
owen
bent
toward
the
girl
and
touched
her
hand
gently
i
do
want
you
to
leave
love
out
of
your
life
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
and
then
owen
opened
a
drawer
and
drew
out
a
faded
morocco
case
here
a
daguerreotype
of
my
mother
and
me
when
i
was
about
four
years
old
notice
how
cute
i
look
in
those
pantalets
ever
see
those
things
before
well
i
been
thinking
that
i
a
kind
of
from
daguerreotype
times
and
you
belong
to
the
day
of
the
kodak
i
a
dingy
old
shadow
in
a
daguerreotype
picture
in
pantalets
cuddled
up
against
my
mother
hoopskirt
you
sylvia
can
take
a
and
a
kodak
and
travel
alone
to
siam
and
you
can
teach
in
a
college
alongside
of
men
and
do
any
number
of
things
my
mother
would
have
dropped
dead
to
think
about
and
she
added
quizzically
it
gives
me
heart
failure
myself
sometimes
just
thinking
about
it
all
i
ca
make
you
throw
your
kodak
away
and
i
would
if
i
could
any
more
than
i
want
you
to
sit
up
all
night
sewing
clothes
to
wear
to
your
when
you
can
buy
better
ones
already
made
that
have
real
style
it
tickles
me
that
some
women
have
learned
that
to
massage
and
paraffine
their
wrinkles
out
those
things
sylvia
strike
me
as
downright
immoral
what
i
been
wondering
is
whether
i
can
do
anything
for
the
kind
of
girls
we
have
at
elizabeth
house
beyond
giving
them
a
place
to
sleep
and
i
guess
you
struck
the
idea
with
that
word
efficiency
no
girl
born
particularly
in
a
town
like
this
is
going
back
to
make
her
own
soap
out
of
grease
and
lye
in
her
back
yard
but
she
got
to
learn
to
do
something
well
or
starve
or
go
to
the
bad
or
if
she
does
have
to
work
she
fool
her
life
away
doing
nothing
now
you
poke
a
few
holes
in
my
ideas
sylvia
please
aunt
sally
do
think
that
because
i
been
to
college
i
can
answer
all
those
questions
i
just
beginning
to
study
them
but
the
lady
of
the
daguerreotype
in
hoops
marks
one
era
and
the
kodak
girl
in
a
short
skirt
and
another
women
had
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
proving
that
their
brains
could
stand
the
strain
of
higher
education
that
they
could
take
the
college
courses
prescribed
for
men
that
all
been
settled
now
but
we
ca
stop
there
a
college
education
for
women
is
all
right
but
we
must
help
the
girl
who
ca
go
to
college
to
do
her
work
well
in
the
office
and
department
store
and
factory
or
to
feed
a
baby
so
it
wo
die
of
colic
and
to
keep
ptomaine
poison
out
of
her
ice
box
added
owen
exactly
replied
sylvia
suppose
a
girl
like
marian
had
gone
to
college
just
as
you
did
what
would
it
have
done
for
her
a
good
deal
undoubtedly
it
would
have
given
her
wider
interests
and
sobered
her
and
broadened
her
chances
of
happiness
maybe
so
remarked
owen
and
then
a
smile
stole
over
her
face
i
reckon
you
can
hardly
call
marian
a
kodak
girl
she
more
like
one
of
these
flashlight
things
they
set
off
with
a
big
explosion
only
time
i
ever
got
caught
in
one
of
those
pictures
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
breeders
association
last
week
they
fired
off
that
photograph
machine
to
get
a
picture
for
the
i
been
prodding
them
for
not
printing
more
farm
and
stock
news
and
a
man
sitting
next
to
me
jumped
clean
out
of
his
boots
and
yelled
fire
i
had
to
go
over
to
the
office
and
see
the
editor
that
atwill
is
a
pretty
good
fellow
when
you
get
used
to
him
to
make
sure
they
guy
us
farmers
for
not
being
city
broke
as
for
marian
folks
like
her
no
one
can
help
liking
her
she
a
girl
of
impulses
and
her
impulses
are
all
healthy
and
sound
and
her
good
fellowship
and
good
feeling
are
inexhaustible
she
came
over
to
see
me
at
elizabeth
house
the
other
evening
had
allen
bring
her
in
his
machine
and
leave
her
the
girls
were
singing
songs
and
amusing
themselves
in
the
parlor
and
marian
took
off
her
hat
and
made
herself
at
home
with
them
she
sang
several
songs
and
then
got
to
up
and
did
some
of
those
dances
she
picked
up
somewhere
did
them
well
too
but
with
all
her
nonsense
she
has
a
lot
of
good
common
sense
and
she
will
find
a
place
for
herself
she
will
get
married
one
of
these
days
and
settle
down
beautifully
allen
possibly
the
bassetts
do
seem
troubled
by
allen
attentions
to
marian
but
the
real
fight
between
thatcher
and
bassett
come
yet
who
says
so
oh
it
in
the
air
every
one
says
so
dan
says
so
i
warned
morton
to
let
edward
thatcher
alone
the
united
states
senate
would
be
ornamented
by
having
either
one
of
them
down
there
i
met
colonel
ramsay
guess
he
got
the
senatorial
bee
in
his
hat
too
coming
up
on
the
train
from
louisville
the
other
day
there
only
one
qualification
i
can
think
of
that
the
colonel
has
for
going
to
the
senate
he
would
wring
tears
out
of
the
galleries
when
he
made
obituary
speeches
about
the
dead
members
when
my
brother
blackford
was
senator
it
seemed
to
me
he
spent
most
of
his
time
acting
as
pallbearer
for
the
dead
ones
but
what
were
we
talking
about
sylvia
oh
yes
i
going
to
send
those
catalogues
over
to
your
room
and
as
you
get
time
i
want
you
to
study
out
a
scheme
for
a
little
school
to
teach
what
you
call
efficiency
to
girls
that
have
to
earn
their
living
i
do
mean
but
a
whole
lot
of
things
women
ought
to
be
doing
but
ai
because
they
do
know
how
do
you
get
the
idea
a
school
asked
sylvia
wonderingly
a
kind
of
school
it
a
splendid
a
beautiful
idea
but
you
need
better
advice
than
i
can
give
you
they
talk
a
good
deal
now
about
vocational
training
and
it
going
to
mean
a
great
deal
to
women
well
we
must
get
hold
of
all
the
latest
ideas
and
if
there
any
good
in
us
old
daguerreotypes
we
keep
it
and
graft
it
on
to
the
kodak
oh
i
hope
there
will
always
be
ladies
of
the
daguerreotype
one
thing
we
women
have
to
pray
to
be
saved
from
is
intolerance
toward
our
sisters
you
know
continued
sylvia
with
a
dropping
of
her
voice
and
a
tilting
of
her
head
that
caused
owen
to
laugh
you
know
we
are
not
awfully
tolerant
and
there
a
breadth
of
view
an
ability
to
brush
away
trifles
and
get
to
the
heart
of
things
that
we
just
growing
up
to
and
magnanimity
i
think
we
fall
short
there
i
just
now
trying
to
cultivate
a
sisterly
feeling
toward
these
good
women
for
whom
jane
austen
and
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
the
knitting
of
tea
cosies
are
all
of
life
who
like
mild
twilight
with
the
children
singing
hymns
at
the
piano
and
the
husband
coming
home
to
find
his
slippers
set
up
against
the
baseburner
that
was
beautiful
but
even
they
owe
something
to
the
million
or
so
women
to
whom
jane
addams
is
far
more
important
than
jane
austen
it
might
be
more
comfortable
if
the
world
never
moved
but
unfortunately
it
does
seem
to
turn
over
occasionally
i
notice
that
you
can
say
things
like
that
sylvia
without
waving
your
hands
or
shouting
like
an
old
woman
with
a
shawl
on
her
head
swinging
a
broom
at
the
boys
in
her
cherry
tree
we
got
to
learn
to
do
that
it
was
some
time
after
i
went
into
business
when
jackson
owen
died
before
i
learned
that
you
could
shoo
men
the
way
you
shoo
hens
you
got
to
drop
a
little
corn
in
a
fence
corner
and
then
throw
your
apron
over
it
strikes
me
that
if
you
could
catch
these
girls
that
go
to
work
in
stores
and
offices
young
enough
you
might
put
them
in
the
way
of
doing
something
better
there
are
schools
doing
this
kind
of
thing
but
like
to
plant
one
right
here
in
indiana
for
the
kind
of
girls
we
got
at
elizabeth
house
they
have
much
ambition
most
of
stuck
right
where
they
are
i
like
to
see
what
can
be
done
toward
changing
that
and
see
it
started
in
my
lifetime
and
we
must
do
it
right
think
it
over
as
you
get
time
she
glanced
at
the
window
better
stay
all
night
sylvia
it
getting
dark
no
i
must
run
along
home
the
girls
expect
me
that
school
idea
just
between
you
and
me
for
the
present
owen
remarked
as
she
watched
sylvia
button
her
mackintosh
look
here
sylvia
do
you
need
some
money
i
mean
of
course
do
you
want
to
borrow
some
oh
never
by
the
way
i
did
tell
you
that
i
expect
to
make
some
the
publisher
of
one
of
grandfather
textbooks
came
to
see
me
about
the
copyright
and
there
were
some
changes
in
the
book
that
grandfather
thought
should
be
made
and
i
going
to
make
them
there
a
chance
of
it
being
adopted
in
one
or
two
states
and
then
i
want
to
make
a
geometry
of
my
own
all
the
textbooks
make
it
so
hard
and
it
really
is
the
same
publisher
told
me
he
thought
well
of
my
scheme
and
going
ahead
with
it
well
do
you
kill
yourself
writing
geometries
i
should
think
teaching
the
youngsters
would
be
a
full
job
that
not
a
job
at
all
aunt
sally
that
just
fun
and
you
know
not
going
to
do
it
always
i
learning
things
now
that
i
needed
to
know
i
only
wish
my
mind
were
as
sound
as
my
health
you
ought
to
wear
heavier
flannels
though
it
a
perfect
scandal
what
girls
run
around
in
nowadays
she
rested
her
hands
on
sylvia
shoulders
lightly
smiled
into
her
face
and
then
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
i
do
understand
why
you
wo
wear
rubbers
but
be
sure
you
sit
around
all
evening
in
wet
stockings
a
gray
mist
was
hastening
nightfall
though
the
street
lamps
were
not
yet
lighted
the
glow
of
owen
kindness
lingered
with
sylvia
as
she
walked
toward
elizabeth
house
she
was
constantly
surprised
by
her
friend
intensely
modern
spirit
her
social
curiosity
and
the
breadth
and
sanity
of
her
views
this
suggestion
of
a
vocational
school
for
young
women
had
kindled
sylvia
imagination
and
her
thoughts
were
upon
it
as
she
tramped
homeward
through
the
slush
to
establish
an
institution
such
as
owen
had
indicated
would
require
a
large
sum
of
money
and
there
were
always
the
bassetts
the
heirs
apparent
of
their
aunt
fortune
any
feeling
of
guilt
sylvia
may
have
experienced
by
reason
of
her
enforced
connivance
with
owen
for
the
expenditure
of
her
money
was
mitigated
by
her
belief
that
the
bassetts
were
quite
beyond
the
need
of
their
aunt
million
the
figure
at
which
fortune
was
commonly
appraised
she
was
thinking
of
this
when
a
few
blocks
from
owen
she
met
morton
bassett
the
electric
lamp
overhead
was
just
sputtering
into
light
as
he
moved
toward
her
out
of
an
intersecting
street
his
folded
umbrella
was
thrust
awkwardly
under
his
arm
and
he
walked
slowly
with
bent
head
the
hissing
of
the
lamp
caused
him
to
lift
his
eyes
sylvia
paused
an
instant
and
he
raised
his
hat
as
he
recognized
her
good
evening
miss
garrison
i
just
been
out
for
a
walk
it
a
dreary
evening
is
it
sylvia
explained
that
she
had
been
to
owen
and
was
on
her
way
home
and
he
asked
if
he
might
go
with
her
marian
usually
walked
with
me
at
fraserville
but
since
we
been
here
sunday
seems
to
be
her
busy
day
i
find
that
i
do
know
much
about
the
residential
district
i
can
easily
lose
myself
in
this
part
of
town
during
these
commonplaces
she
wondered
just
where
their
conversation
at
marian
ball
had
left
them
the
wet
street
was
hardly
a
more
favorable
place
for
serious
talk
than
the
crowded
propylæum
the
rain
began
to
fall
monotonously
and
he
raised
his
umbrella
some
things
have
happened
since
our
last
talk
he
observed
presently
yes
she
replied
dubiously
i
want
to
talk
to
you
of
them
he
answered
dan
has
left
me
you
know
that
yes
i
know
of
it
and
you
think
he
has
done
quite
the
fine
thing
about
it
it
was
what
you
would
have
had
him
do
yes
certainly
you
practically
told
me
you
were
putting
him
to
the
test
you
were
embarrassed
by
his
course
in
any
way
you
were
able
to
show
him
that
you
did
care
you
did
need
him
you
saw
that
you
read
that
in
what
followed
it
was
written
so
large
that
no
one
could
miss
it
you
are
the
master
you
proved
it
again
i
suppose
you
found
a
great
satisfaction
in
that
a
man
must
or
he
would
do
such
things
you
seem
to
understand
he
replied
turning
toward
her
for
an
instant
but
there
may
be
one
thing
you
do
understand
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
they
splashed
on
slowly
through
the
slush
i
liked
dan
i
was
fond
of
him
and
yet
i
deliberately
planned
to
make
him
do
that
kind
of
thing
for
me
i
pulled
him
out
of
the
newspaper
office
and
made
it
possible
for
him
to
study
law
just
that
i
might
put
my
hand
on
him
when
he
could
be
useful
please
understand
that
i
not
saying
this
in
the
hope
that
you
will
intercede
to
bring
him
back
nothing
can
bring
him
back
i
would
let
him
come
back
to
me
if
he
would
starve
without
my
help
sylvia
was
silent
there
was
nothing
with
which
she
could
meet
this
what
i
mean
is
he
continued
that
i
glad
he
shook
me
i
had
wondered
from
the
beginning
just
when
it
would
come
and
when
i
saw
his
things
going
out
of
my
office
it
satisfied
something
in
me
i
wonder
whether
there
some
good
in
me
after
all
that
made
me
glad
in
spite
of
myself
that
he
had
the
manhood
to
quit
bassett
was
a
complex
character
his
talk
and
manner
at
marian
ball
had
given
her
a
sense
of
this
which
he
was
now
confirming
success
had
not
brought
him
happiness
the
loss
of
dan
had
been
a
blow
to
him
and
she
felt
the
friendlessness
and
isolation
of
this
man
whom
men
feared
he
had
spoken
doggedly
gruffly
and
if
she
had
marveled
at
their
talk
at
the
dance
her
wonder
was
the
greater
now
it
was
inconceivable
that
morton
bassett
should
come
to
her
with
his
difficulties
if
his
conscience
troubled
him
or
if
he
was
touched
with
remorse
for
his
conduct
toward
dan
harwood
she
was
unable
to
see
why
he
should
make
his
confession
to
her
it
seemed
that
he
had
read
her
thoughts
for
he
spoke
roughly
as
though
defending
himself
from
an
attack
you
like
him
you
known
him
for
several
years
you
know
him
probably
better
than
you
know
any
other
man
i
suppose
i
do
bassett
said
sylvia
we
are
good
friends
but
that
all
he
stopped
short
and
she
felt
his
hand
touch
her
arm
for
an
instant
lightly
it
was
almost
like
a
caress
there
in
the
street
with
the
maple
boughs
swishing
overhead
in
the
cold
west
wind
he
quickened
his
pace
now
as
though
to
mark
a
new
current
in
his
thoughts
there
a
favor
i
want
to
ask
of
you
miss
garrison
dan
talked
to
me
once
or
twice
about
your
grandfather
estate
he
owned
some
shares
in
a
business
i
had
helped
to
organize
the
white
river
canneries
the
scheme
failed
for
many
reasons
the
shares
are
worthless
i
want
you
to
let
me
pay
you
back
the
money
professor
kelton
paid
for
them
i
should
have
to
do
it
privately
it
would
have
to
be
a
matter
between
you
and
me
illustration
a
sudden
fierce
anger
burned
in
her
heart
oh
no
dan
explained
that
to
me
he
did
hold
you
responsible
he
said
the
company
failed
that
was
all
you
are
kind
to
offer
but
i
ca
think
of
accepting
it
very
well
he
said
quietly
and
then
added
as
though
to
explain
himself
more
fully
your
grandfather
and
owen
were
old
friends
he
was
a
business
man
i
promoted
the
canneries
scheme
and
i
was
responsible
for
it
no
matter
what
harwood
says
about
it
she
had
experienced
sharp
alternations
of
pity
and
apprehension
in
this
brief
walk
he
was
a
prominent
man
almost
it
might
be
said
a
notorious
character
the
instinct
of
was
strong
in
her
what
might
lie
behind
his
confidences
his
blunt
confessions
and
his
offer
of
help
she
did
not
know
they
had
reached
elizabeth
house
and
she
paused
on
the
broad
steps
under
the
shelter
of
the
veranda
with
her
back
toward
the
door
she
looked
down
upon
him
as
he
stood
on
the
sidewalk
his
umbrella
deeply
shadowing
his
head
and
shoulders
she
stood
before
him
like
a
vestal
guarding
her
temple
from
desecration
she
was
conscious
of
a
sharp
revulsion
of
feeling
and
a
sudden
fierce
anger
burned
in
her
heart
she
spoke
with
a
quick
passionate
utterance
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
me
bassett
i
going
to
bring
rose
farrell
back
to
this
house
i
want
you
to
let
her
alone
he
stood
dumbly
staring
at
the
door
as
it
closed
upon
her
he
lingered
a
moment
the
rain
beating
down
upon
him
and
then
walked
slowly
homeward
chapter
xxvi
april
vistas
is
it
it
possible
colonel
ramsay
entrances
were
frequently
a
bit
theatrical
and
on
a
particular
afternoon
in
april
as
he
opened
the
door
of
dan
new
office
in
the
law
building
the
sight
of
miss
farrell
at
the
typewriter
moved
him
to
characteristic
demonstrations
carefully
closing
the
door
and
advancing
hat
in
hand
with
every
appearance
of
deepest
humility
he
gazed
upon
the
young
woman
with
a
mockery
of
astonishment
verily
it
is
possible
he
solemnly
ejaculated
and
what
is
it
that
our
own
poet
says
she
comes
home
again
a
thousand
ways
i
fashion
to
myself
the
tenderness
of
my
glad
welcome
i
shall
tremble
yes
stop
trembling
colonel
and
try
one
of
our
new
office
chairs
warranted
to
hold
anybody
but
brother
ike
pettit
without
fading
away
the
colonel
bent
over
miss
farrell
hand
reverently
and
sat
down
i
been
trying
to
earn
an
honest
living
practicing
law
down
at
home
and
this
is
the
first
chance
i
had
to
come
up
and
see
what
the
late
lamented
legislature
left
of
the
proud
old
hoosier
state
is
dan
locked
up
inside
there
with
some
lucrative
client
i
regret
to
say
that
i
do
believe
there
a
cent
in
his
present
caller
hark
at
this
moment
a
roar
was
heard
from
the
inner
room
on
which
private
was
printed
in
discreet
letters
the
colonel
was
at
once
alert
me
no
more
the
moon
may
draw
the
but
isaac
pettit
jokes
shall
shake
the
land
with
apologies
to
the
late
laureate
so
the
boys
are
finding
their
way
up
here
are
they
i
wait
an
hour
or
two
till
that
compendium
of
american
humor
has
talked
dan
to
sleep
so
you
and
dan
left
your
uncle
morton
all
alone
in
gloomy
splendor
in
the
boordman
building
harwood
made
me
an
offer
and
i
accepted
it
replied
rose
this
is
a
free
country
and
a
can
work
where
she
pleases
ca
she
certainly
a
poor
rose
clasped
her
hands
and
bowed
her
head
if
the
initials
fail
to
illuminate
the
colonel
inspected
the
room
and
his
eyes
searched
miss
desk
let
me
see
i
seem
to
miss
something
it
must
be
the
literary
offerings
that
used
to
cluster
about
the
scene
of
your
labors
your
selections
in
old
times
used
to
delight
me
no
one
else
of
my
acquaintance
has
quite
your
feeling
for
romance
i
always
liked
that
one
about
the
american
engineer
who
won
the
crown
princess
of
piffle
from
her
father
in
a
poker
game
but
decided
at
the
last
minute
to
bestow
her
upon
his
old
college
friend
the
russian
just
to
preserve
the
peace
of
europe
i
remember
i
found
you
crying
over
the
great
renunciation
one
day
oh
i
passed
that
all
up
colonel
i
strong
for
the
pale
business
now
i
doing
time
in
all
the
night
classes
at
elizabeth
house
where
i
board
and
you
hardly
know
your
little
rose
pretty
soon
fitting
yourself
for
one
of
the
learned
professions
scarcely
just
fitting
myself
to
be
decent
replied
rose
in
a
tone
that
shifted
the
key
of
the
conversation
a
change
which
the
colonel
respected
that
right
rose
this
is
a
good
place
for
you
and
so
is
by
the
way
who
this
aunt
sally
has
taken
up
saw
her
at
the
chum
of
the
old
lady
you
must
mean
miss
sylvia
sylvia
miss
sylvia
garrison
colonel
ramsay
continued
rose
earnestly
resting
an
elbow
lightly
on
her
typewriter
you
and
i
are
old
pals
you
remember
that
first
winter
i
was
over
at
the
state
house
very
well
rose
well
it
was
a
good
place
for
me
to
be
but
i
was
a
kid
and
much
sense
i
learned
a
good
deal
since
then
it
ai
so
easy
to
walk
straight
so
many
people
are
careless
about
leaving
banana
peelings
lying
round
the
colonel
nodded
you
need
apologize
to
me
rose
it
all
right
now
is
it
you
can
be
dead
sure
of
it
colonel
miss
garrison
caught
me
by
the
heel
of
my
shoe
just
as
i
was
going
down
the
third
time
and
yanked
me
back
there
a
good
many
cheap
imitations
of
human
beings
loose
around
this
world
but
that
a
woman
i
can
tell
you
glad
you
struck
a
good
friend
rose
you
did
well
to
come
along
with
harwood
well
she
fixed
that
too
after
i
cut
loose
from
you
understand
i
guess
miss
garrison
and
harwood
are
pretty
good
friends
oh
ejaculated
ramsay
so
there
that
is
there
i
hope
so
they
all
white
and
speak
the
same
language
this
is
on
the
dead
i
only
talking
to
you
because
you
an
old
friend
an
occasional
roar
from
within
testified
to
pettit
continued
enjoyment
of
his
own
jokes
you
know
rose
continued
i
learned
a
good
deal
those
winters
i
spent
at
the
state
house
when
i
was
stenog
to
certain
senate
committees
i
see
where
you
stand
now
all
right
colonel
i
always
knew
you
belong
in
that
bunch
of
lobbyists
that
was
always
through
the
marble
halls
of
the
state
house
thatcher
sends
somebody
around
to
look
me
up
every
little
while
to
see
if
he
ca
coax
something
out
of
me
something
he
can
use
you
know
thatcher
ought
to
do
that
if
you
want
me
to
i
pull
him
off
no
i
guess
i
can
take
care
of
myself
he
rose
indicated
the
inner
office
with
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
he
never
tries
to
pump
me
he
ai
that
kind
of
a
fighter
but
everybody
that
anywhere
near
the
inside
knows
that
thatcher
carries
a
sharp
knife
he
going
to
shed
some
pink
ink
before
he
gets
through
are
you
on
they
exchanged
a
glance
something
that
is
nice
rose
nodded
i
hate
to
see
that
sort
of
thing
brought
into
the
game
but
never
find
anything
the
gentleman
we
are
referring
to
works
on
noiseless
rollers
colonel
ramsay
indicated
the
closed
door
by
an
almost
imperceptible
gesture
of
interrogation
and
rose
replied
by
compressing
her
lips
and
shaking
her
head
he
is
in
on
that
he
a
gentleman
you
know
not
a
he
might
have
to
stand
for
anything
thatcher
springs
thatcher
has
developed
into
a
shrewd
and
hard
fighter
the
other
crowd
do
laugh
at
him
any
more
it
was
his
work
that
got
our
legislative
ticket
through
last
fall
when
bassett
passed
the
word
that
we
should
take
a
licking
just
to
magnify
his
importance
is
thatcher
in
town
now
no
that
boy
of
his
with
the
bad
lung
had
to
go
off
to
the
adirondacks
and
he
went
with
him
the
inner
door
opened
at
this
moment
disclosing
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
who
greeted
ramsay
effusively
what
is
immortality
gentlemen
the
honorable
isaac
pettit
inquired
clinging
to
the
colonel
hand
we
had
a
little
social
gathering
for
our
new
pastor
up
at
fraser
the
other
night
and
i
sprung
a
new
game
on
the
old
folks
offered
a
prize
for
anybody
who
could
name
all
the
of
the
united
states
since
lincoln
administration
and
they
could
even
get
past
grant
and
schuyler
colfax
being
right
off
our
own
hoosier
pastures
then
we
tried
for
the
democratic
candidates
for
president
beginning
back
at
the
war
and
they
could
even
start
one
young
chap
piped
up
and
said
jeff
davis
oh
lord
which
reminds
me
that
the
teaching
of
history
in
the
public
schools
ai
what
it
ought
to
be
they
had
heard
of
hancock
and
when
somebody
said
blaine
the
teacher
of
the
infant
class
in
our
sunday
school
said
blaine
who
that
reminds
me
of
one
time
when
i
met
dan
voorhees
than
whom
god
almighty
never
made
a
nobler
soul
i
met
dan
down
here
in
the
lobby
of
the
old
bates
house
carrying
a
weekly
with
one
of
tom
cartoons
spread
wide
open
you
know
dan
had
colonel
ramsay
had
been
edging
toward
the
door
of
harwood
private
room
and
he
now
broke
in
upon
the
editor
reminiscences
you
tell
that
story
to
miss
farrell
ike
i
spouting
myself
at
a
christian
endeavor
rally
at
tipton
and
want
to
see
dan
a
minute
miss
farrell
was
inured
to
pettit
anecdotes
of
dan
voorhees
and
the
fraserville
editor
continued
unmindful
of
the
closing
of
the
door
upon
dan
and
ramsay
ramsay
pushed
his
fedora
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
inspected
dan
new
furniture
well
you
did
it
you
cut
loose
from
your
base
and
burned
your
bridges
behind
you
i
would
have
brought
my
congratulations
sooner
but
i
had
a
long
jury
case
on
hand
you
did
it
my
boy
and
you
did
it
like
a
gentleman
you
might
have
killed
him
if
you
had
wanted
to
i
do
want
to
kill
anybody
smiled
dan
i
want
to
practice
law
that
a
laudable
ambition
but
you
ca
go
back
on
us
now
what
needed
for
a
long
time
was
a
young
man
of
about
your
who
afraid
do
rub
it
in
colonel
i
was
a
mighty
long
time
seeing
the
light
and
i
do
deserve
any
praise
from
anybody
i
mean
what
i
say
about
practicing
law
i
a
free
man
now
and
any
political
work
i
do
is
going
to
be
along
the
lines
of
the
simple
childish
ideas
i
brought
home
from
college
with
me
i
had
begun
to
feel
that
all
this
political
idealism
was
sheer
rubbish
but
i
put
the
brakes
on
before
i
got
too
far
downhill
if
a
few
of
us
who
have
run
with
the
machine
and
know
the
tricks
will
turn
and
help
the
bewildered
idealists
we
can
make
idealism
effective
most
of
the
people
do
want
a
handful
of
crooks
to
govern
them
but
there
a
kind
of
cheap
cynicism
abroad
that
discourages
the
men
who
are
eager
to
revolt
there
are
newspapers
that
foster
that
sentiment
and
scores
of
men
who
wo
take
time
to
go
to
a
caucus
keep
asking
what
the
use
now
as
for
bassett
i
not
going
to
bite
the
hand
that
fed
me
i
simply
going
to
feed
myself
pettit
was
just
in
here
to
sound
me
as
to
my
feelings
toward
thatcher
quite
frankly
not
interested
in
thatcher
as
a
senatorial
possibility
that
all
right
but
if
you
had
to
make
a
choice
between
thatcher
and
bassett
dan
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
you
must
exaggerate
the
importance
of
my
influence
i
do
carry
united
states
senatorships
around
in
my
pocket
you
the
most
influential
man
of
your
age
in
our
state
i
not
so
sure
you
would
be
able
to
elect
any
man
you
supported
if
the
election
were
held
you
mastered
the
delicate
art
of
flattery
colonel
when
the
time
comes
i
be
in
the
fight
it
not
so
dead
certain
that
our
going
to
have
a
senator
to
elect
there
always
that
but
all
the
walls
are
covered
with
handwriting
these
days
that
does
need
interpreting
by
me
or
any
other
daniel
many
of
the
younger
men
all
over
this
state
in
both
parties
are
getting
ready
to
assert
themselves
what
we
want
what
you
want
i
believe
is
to
make
this
state
count
for
something
in
national
affairs
just
changing
parties
does
help
anything
i
rather
not
shift
at
all
than
send
some
fellow
to
the
senate
just
because
he
can
capture
a
caucus
it
my
honest
conviction
that
any
man
can
get
a
caucus
vote
if
he
will
play
according
to
the
old
rules
you
and
i
go
out
over
the
state
bawling
to
the
people
that
they
are
governing
this
country
we
appeal
to
them
for
their
votes
when
we
know
well
enough
that
between
thatcher
and
bassett
as
democrats
and
jordan
and
ridgefield
in
the
republican
camp
the
people
stand
to
win
it
may
tickle
you
to
know
that
i
had
some
flattering
invitations
lately
to
join
the
republicans
not
from
the
old
guard
mind
you
but
from
some
of
the
young
fellows
who
want
to
score
results
for
policies
not
politicians
i
suppose
after
all
colonel
i
only
a
kind
of
academic
democrat
with
no
patience
whatever
with
this
eternal
hitching
of
our
ancient
mule
to
the
saloons
and
breweries
just
to
win
in
the
next
campaign
i
going
to
preach
my
academic
democracy
all
the
way
from
lake
michigan
to
the
ohio
river
up
and
down
and
back
and
forth
and
i
going
to
do
it
at
my
own
expense
and
not
be
responsible
to
any
state
committee
or
anybody
else
that
about
where
i
stand
good
mighty
good
dan
all
the
rest
of
us
want
is
for
you
to
holler
that
in
your
biggest
foghorn
voice
and
you
find
the
crowd
with
you
but
if
the
crowd
is
with
me
it
wo
make
a
bit
of
difference
i
shall
bark
just
the
same
now
that
we
got
down
to
brass
tacks
i
tell
you
what
i
thought
ever
since
bassett
got
his
clamps
on
the
party
that
he
really
any
qualities
of
leadership
that
grim
silent
way
of
his
is
a
good
deal
of
a
bluff
if
anybody
ever
has
the
nerve
to
set
off
a
firecracker
just
behind
him
he
run
a
mile
the
newspapers
keep
flashing
him
up
in
big
headlines
all
the
time
and
that
helps
to
keep
the
people
fooled
the
last
time
i
saw
him
was
just
after
he
put
through
that
corporation
bill
you
broke
on
and
he
did
seem
to
have
got
much
fun
out
of
his
victory
he
looked
pretty
gray
and
worried
it
was
so
easy
pulling
through
house
bill
it
was
the
hardest
job
of
mort
life
but
he
had
to
do
it
or
take
the
count
and
lord
he
certainly
lost
his
head
in
defeating
those
appropriation
bills
he
let
his
spite
toward
the
governor
get
the
better
of
him
it
was
the
republican
governor
he
put
in
the
hole
it
was
his
own
party
that
the
way
with
all
these
men
of
his
type
on
both
sides
they
have
no
real
loyalty
they
will
sacrifice
their
parties
any
time
just
to
further
personal
ends
or
in
this
case
it
would
seem
to
have
been
out
of
sheer
bad
temper
i
did
use
to
think
bassett
had
any
temper
or
any
kind
of
emotional
organization
but
when
he
mad
it
the
meanest
kind
of
mad
blind
and
revengeful
he
forced
an
extra
session
he
brought
that
on
us
just
chew
on
that
a
minute
dan
a
republican
governor
has
got
to
reassemble
a
democratic
legislature
merely
to
correct
its
own
faults
it
looks
well
in
print
by
george
speaking
of
print
how
did
he
come
to
let
go
of
the
and
who
owns
that
sheet
anyway
i
thought
when
thatcher
sprung
that
suit
and
dragged
our
aunt
sally
into
it
the
wabash
river
would
run
hot
lava
for
the
next
forty
years
but
that
night
of
the
ball
she
and
mort
stood
there
on
the
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
harwood
grinned
and
shook
his
head
gravely
there
are
some
things
colonel
that
even
to
a
good
friend
like
you
i
ca
give
away
besides
i
promised
atwill
not
to
tell
all
right
dan
and
now
for
fear
you
may
think
i
got
something
up
my
sleeve
i
want
to
say
to
you
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
that
i
want
any
office
now
or
ever
now
colonel
be
very
careful
laughed
dan
no
i
not
up
here
on
a
but
i
want
you
to
know
where
i
stand
and
the
friendly
feeling
of
a
whole
lot
of
people
toward
you
you
say
the
younger
men
are
getting
tired
of
the
old
boss
system
i
tell
you
that
a
lot
of
the
old
fellows
too
are
beginning
to
get
restless
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
game
on
both
sides
is
beginning
to
get
into
the
inner
consciousness
of
the
people
you
know
if
i
had
stayed
regular
when
the
business
came
on
i
might
have
been
in
a
position
now
to
play
for
the
governorship
which
is
the
only
thing
i
ever
wanted
rather
nice
to
be
governor
of
your
own
state
and
have
your
name
scratched
on
a
slab
at
the
state
house
door
it
even
conceivable
daniel
that
a
man
might
do
a
little
good
barely
possible
he
concluded
dryly
i
out
of
it
now
for
good
but
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
do
wait
to
write
just
telephone
me
now
i
not
so
sure
you
ca
make
it
yet
i
like
to
see
you
there
thanks
daniel
but
like
you
i
in
the
ranks
of
the
patriots
and
not
looking
for
the
pie
counter
here
another
matter
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
up
to
in
this
white
river
canneries
business
i
notice
that
you
been
sticking
the
into
it
yes
that
protest
of
the
original
stockholders
against
the
reorganization
is
still
pending
as
administrator
of
the
estate
of
professor
kelton
you
remember
him
madison
college
i
filed
a
petition
to
be
let
into
the
case
it
been
sleeping
along
for
a
couple
of
years
stockholders
too
poor
to
put
up
a
fight
i
undertaken
to
probe
clear
into
the
mire
i
got
lots
of
time
and
there
lots
of
mire
good
they
say
the
succotash
and
peaches
were
all
cooked
in
the
same
pot
and
that
our
uncle
mort
did
the
skimming
so
they
say
but
believe
me
i
can
attack
him
without
doing
violence
to
my
professional
conscience
white
river
canneries
was
never
in
the
boordman
office
to
my
knowledge
this
is
vengeance
on
my
part
my
duty
to
get
what
i
can
for
the
estate
well
some
of
our
farmers
down
my
way
got
soaked
in
that
deal
but
it
never
seemed
worth
while
to
waste
their
money
in
litigation
i
be
glad
to
turn
the
claims
i
have
in
my
office
over
to
you
the
more
you
have
the
stronger
fight
you
can
make
good
i
welcome
business
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
can
as
a
dan
had
attracted
more
attention
than
he
liked
in
all
the
circumstances
now
that
the
legislature
had
adjourned
he
was
anxious
to
give
his
energy
to
the
law
and
he
did
not
encourage
political
pilgrims
to
visit
his
office
he
felt
that
he
had
behaved
generously
toward
his
old
chief
when
the
end
came
and
the
promptness
with
which
bassett
old
guard
sought
to
impeach
his
motives
in
fighting
the
corporation
bill
angered
him
threats
of
retaliation
were
conveyed
to
him
from
certain
quarters
and
from
less
violent
sources
he
heard
much
of
his
ingratitude
toward
the
man
who
had
made
him
he
had
failed
in
his
efforts
to
secure
the
passage
of
several
measures
whose
enactment
was
urged
by
the
educational
and
philanthropic
interests
of
the
community
and
this
was
plainly
attributable
to
the
animosity
aroused
by
his
desertion
of
the
corporation
bill
he
had
not
finished
with
this
last
measure
which
had
been
passed
by
bassett
combination
over
the
governor
veto
the
labor
organizations
were
in
arms
against
it
and
had
engaged
dan
to
attack
it
in
the
courts
sylvia
approval
of
his
course
had
been
as
cordial
as
he
could
have
asked
and
as
the
spring
advanced
they
were
much
together
they
attended
concerts
the
theatre
and
lectures
as
often
as
she
had
time
for
relaxation
and
they
met
pretty
regularly
at
owen
dinner
table
on
sunday
often
running
out
for
long
tramps
in
the
country
afterward
to
return
for
supper
and
a
renewal
of
their
triangular
councils
the
bassetts
were
to
continue
at
the
bosworth
house
until
june
and
when
marian
dashed
in
upon
these
sunday
symposiums
sometimes
with
a
young
cavalier
she
had
taken
out
for
a
promenade
she
gave
dan
to
understand
that
his
difficulties
with
her
father
made
not
the
slightest
difference
to
her
but
mama
she
spoke
of
her
mother
as
of
one
whose
views
must
not
weigh
heavily
against
the
world

good
cheer
mama
says
she
trusted
you
that
there
was
just
that
something
about
you
that
did
seem
quite
marian
would
shake
her
head
and
sigh
suggestively
whereupon
owen
would
rebuke
her
and
send
her
off
to
find
the
candy

relegated
for
a
time
to

in

himself
by
telegraphing

and
he
usually
managed
to

a

to

with
characteristic
remembrances
for

who
might

have
so
much
curiosity

you
better
give
another
turn

on
those

nothing

without

before
these
condensations
and
transformations
of
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth
in
owen
corps
of
assistants
we
recognize
six
young
women
from
elizabeth
house
for
since
the
first
of
july
elizabeth
house
has
been
constantly
represented
on
waupegan
girls
coming
and
going
in
sixes
for
a
fortnight
at
the
farm
owen
had
not
only
added
bedrooms
to
the
rambling
old
farmhouse
to
accommodate
these
visitors
but
she
had
when
necessary
personally
arranged
with
their
employers
for
their
vacations
on
the
face
of
it
the
use
of
her
farm
as
a
summer
annex
to
the
working
girls
in
town
was
merely
the
whim
of
a
old
woman
with
her
own
peculiar
notions
of
a
cynical
member
of
the
summer
colony
remarked
at
the
casino
that
owen
with
characteristic
thrift
was
inveigling
to
her
farm
and
then
putting
them
to
work
in
her
kitchen
owen
real
purpose
was
the
study
of
the
girls
in
elizabeth
house
with
a
view
to
determining
their
needs
and
aptitude
she
was
as
interested
in
the
woman
of
forty
permanently
planted
behind
a
counter
as
in
the
gayest
stenographer
an
expert
had
built
for
her
that
spring
a
model
plant
for
poultry
raising
an
industry
of
which
she
confessed
her
own
ignorance
and
she
found
in
her
battery
of
incubators
the
greatest
delight
when
a
woman
has
spent
twenty
years
behind
a
counter
sylvia
or
working
a
typewriter
she
has
much
ahead
of
her
what
the
matter
with
ducks
they
made
prodigious
calculations
of
all
sorts
that
summer
and
continued
their
study
of
catalogues
owen
expected
to
visit
the
best
vocational
schools
in
the
country
during
the
fall
and
winter
the
school
could
not
be
a
large
one
but
it
must
be
wisely
planned
owen
had
already
summarized
her
ideas
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
neat
italian
script
which
the
daguerreotype
ladies
of
our
old
seminaries
alone
preserve
for
us
the
students
of
the
proposed
school
were
to
be
girls
between
fifteen
and
eighteen
who
were
driven
by
necessity
into
shops
factories
and
offices
none
should
be
excluded
for
lack
of
the
knowledge
presupposed
in
students
ready
for
high
school
and
the
general
courses
were
to
be
made
flexible
so
that
those
who
entered
deficient
might
be
brought
to
a
fixed
standard
the
vocational
branches
were
the
most
difficult
and
at
sylvia
suggestion
several
authorities
on
technical
education
were
called
into
conference
one
of
these
had
visited
waupegan
and
expressed
his
enthusiastic
approval
of
owen
plans
she
was
anxious
to
avoid
paralleling
any
similar
work
public
or
private
what
the
city
schools
did
in
manual
training
was
well
enough
and
she
did
not
mean
to
compete
with
the
technical
school
or
with
its
reformatory
school
for
erring
girls
the
young
girl
about
to
take
her
place
behind
the
ribbon
counter
or
at
a
in
a
garment
factory
or
as
a
badly
equipped
ignorant
and
hopeless
stenographer
was
the
student
for
whom
in
due
course
the
school
should
open
its
doors
where
necessary
the
parents
of
the
students
were
to
be
paid
the
wages
their
daughters
sacrificed
in
attending
school
during
the
course
proposed
the
students
were
to
live
in
cottages
and
learn
the
domestic
arts
through
their
own
housekeeping
the
members
of
each
household
performing
various
duties
in
rotation
the
school
was
to
continue
in
session
the
year
round
so
that
flower
and
kitchen
gardening
might
take
rank
with
dressmaking
cooking
fruit
culture
poultry
raising
and
other
branches
which
owen
proposed
to
have
taught
i
ca
set
all
up
in
business
but
i
want
a
girl
that
goes
through
the
school
to
feel
that
she
wo
have
to
break
her
back
in
an
overall
factory
all
her
life
or
dance
around
some
with
a
waxed
mustache
they
tell
me
no
american
girl
who
has
ever
seen
a
trolley
car
will
go
into
a
kitchen
to
work
she
ca
have
her
beaux
going
round
to
the
back
door
sylvia
we
got
to
turn
out
cooks
that
are
worth
going
to
kitchen
doors
to
see
now
i
taught
you
this
summer
how
to
make
currant
jelly
that
you
need
be
ashamed
of
anywhere
on
earth
and
it
did
hurt
you
any
a
white
woman
ca
learn
to
cook
the
way
darkies
do
just
by
instinct
that
a
miracle
by
the
way
that
i
never
heard
explained
how
these
colored
women
cook
as
the
good
ones
do
those
darkies
who
take
the
cook
book
out
of
your
hand
and
look
at
it
upside
down
and
grin
and
say
miss
sally
when
they
read
a
word
you
catch
a
clean
wholesome
white
girl
young
enough
and
make
her
understand
that
her
kitchen
a
laboratory
and
her
work
something
to
be
proud
of
and
she
not
have
any
trouble
finding
places
to
work
where
they
wo
ask
her
to
clean
out
the
furnace
and
wash
the
automobile
the
bassetts
had
opened
their
cottage
early
and
morton
bassett
had
been
at
the
lake
rather
more
constantly
than
in
previous
summers
marian
was
off
on
a
round
of
visits
to
the
friends
that
were
the
fruit
of
her
winter
at
the
capital
she
was
much
in
demand
for
house
parties
and
made
her
engagements
quite
independently
of
her
parents
for
weeks
and
fortnights
at
widely
scattered
resorts
bassett
was
indulging
in
the
luxury
of
a
trained
nurse
this
summer
but
even
with
this
reinforcement
she
found
it
impossible
to
manage
marian
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
owen
philanthropic
enterprises
occasioned
her
the
greatest
alarm
it
was
enough
that
that
girl
should
be
spending
the
summer
at
waupegan
without
bringing
with
her
all
her
fellow
boarders
from
elizabeth
house
bassett
had
now
a
tangible
grievance
against
her
husband
blackford
course
at
the
military
school
he
had
chosen
for
himself
had
been
so
unsatisfactory
that
his
father
had
been
advised
that
he
would
not
be
received
for
another
year
it
was
now
bassett
turn
to
cavil
at
her
husband
for
the
sad
mess
he
had
made
of
the
education
she
would
never
have
sent
blackford
to
a
military
school
if
it
had
been
her
affair
she
arraigned
her
husband
for
having
encouraged
the
boy
in
his
dreams
of
west
point
blackford
father
continuing
indifferent
bassett
rose
from
bed
one
hot
august
day
filled
with
determination
blackford
confident
of
immunity
from
books
through
the
long
vacation
was
enjoying
himself
thoroughly
at
the
lake
he
was
a
perfectly
healthy
lad
whose
faults
were
much
like
those
of
the
cheerful
undisciplined
marian
his
mother
scanned
the
reports
of
blackford
demerits
and
decided
that
he
required
tutoring
immediately
she
thereupon
reasoned
that
it
would
score
with
her
aunt
if
she
employed
that
girl
to
coach
the
delinquent
blackford
it
would
at
any
rate
do
no
harm
to
manifest
a
friendly
interest
in
her
aunt
protégée
who
would
doubtless
be
glad
of
a
chance
to
earn
a
little
she
first
proposed
the
matter
to
her
aunt
who
declared
promptly
that
it
must
be
for
sylvia
to
say
that
sylvia
was
busy
writing
a
book
she
was
revising
her
textbook
besides
helping
to
entertain
the
elizabeth
house
guests
but
when
the
matter
was
referred
to
sylvia
she
cheerfully
agreed
to
give
blackford
two
hours
a
day
sylvia
quickly
established
herself
on
terms
of
good
comradeship
with
her
pupil
blackford
was
old
enough
to
find
the
proximity
of
a
pretty
girl
agreeable
and
sylvia
was
sympathetic
and
encouraging
when
he
confided
to
her
his
hopes
of
a
naval
career
he
had
finally
renounced
the
army
sylvia
sent
off
to
annapolis
for
the
entrance
requirements
she
told
him
of
her
grandfather
kelton
service
in
the
navy
and
recounted
some
of
the
old
professor
exploits
in
the
civil
war
the
stories
sylvia
had
heard
at
her
grandfather
knee
served
admirably
as
a
stimulus
as
the
appointments
to
annapolis
had
to
be
won
in
competitive
examinations
she
soon
persuaded
him
that
the
quicker
he
buckled
down
to
hard
study
the
sooner
he
would
attain
the
goal
this
matter
arranged
bassett
went
back
to
bed
where
she
received
sylvia
occasionally
and
expressed
her
sorrow
that
owen
at
her
time
of
life
should
be
running
a
for
a
lot
of
girls
who
were
better
off
at
work
her
aunt
was
merely
making
them
dissatisfied
with
their
lot
she
did
not
guess
the
import
of
the
industries
in
owen
kitchen
as
reported
through
various
agencies
they
were
merely
a
new
idiosyncracy
of
her
aunt
old
age
a
deplorable
manifestation
of
senility
sylvia
was
a
comfortable
confessor
bassett
said
many
things
to
her
that
she
would
have
liked
to
say
to
owen
with
an
obscure
hope
that
they
might
in
due
course
be
communicated
to
that
inexplicable
old
woman
and
sylvia
certainly
was
past
the
difficult
art
of
brushing
hair
without
tangling
and
pulling
it
thereby
tearing
one
nerves
to
shreds
as
the
nurse
did
owen
visits
were
only
occasional
but
they
usually
proved
disturbing
she
sniffed
at
the
nurse
and
advised
her
niece
to
get
up
she
knew
a
woman
in
terre
haute
who
went
to
bed
on
her
thirtieth
birthday
and
left
it
only
to
be
buried
in
her
ninetieth
year
sylvia
was
a
far
more
consoling
visitor
to
this
invalid
propped
up
on
pillows
amid
a
litter
of
magazines
with
the
cool
lake
at
her
elbow
sylvia
did
not
christian
science
and
new
thought
and
such
things
with
which
bassett
was
disposed
to
experiment
sylvia
even
bestowed
upon
her
a
boon
in
the
shape
of
the
word
psychotherapy
bassett
liked
it
and
declared
that
if
she
read
a
paper
before
the
fraserville
woman
club
the
next
winter
a
service
to
which
she
was
solemnly
pledged
psychotherapy
should
be
her
subject
thus
bassett
found
sylvia
serviceable
and
comforting
and
the
girl
knew
her
place
and
all
morton
bassett
found
sylvia
tutoring
his
son
one
day
when
he
arrived
at
waupegan
unexpectedly
bassett
explained
the
arrangement
privately
in
her
own
fashion
you
seem
to
take
no
interest
in
your
children
morton
i
thought
blackford
was
your
particular
pride
but
the
fact
that
he
was
practically
expelled
from
school
seemed
to
make
not
the
slightest
impression
on
you
i
thought
that
until
you
realize
that
the
boy
was
wasting
his
time
here
i
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
miss
garrison
seems
perfectly
competent
she
tells
me
blackford
is
very
quick
all
he
needs
is
application
i
had
got
around
to
that
yet
hallie
i
intended
taking
it
up
this
week
i
very
busy
murmured
bassett
his
wife
choice
of
a
tutor
seemed
inconsistent
with
her
earlier
animosity
toward
sylvia
but
he
shrank
from
asking
explanations
bassett
had
grown
increasingly
difficult
and
arbitrary
that
the
american
father
all
over
well
i
done
my
duty
no
doubt
it
a
good
arrangement
we
got
to
keep
blackford
in
hand
where
marian
she
visiting
the
willings
at
their
place
at
whitewater
she
been
gone
a
week
the
willings
not
those
burton
willings
how
did
that
happen
i
believe
we
care
to
have
her
visit
the
willings
they
are
perfectly
nice
people
she
replied
defensively
and
marian
knew
their
daughter
at
school
allen
thatcher
is
in
the
party
and
they
all
people
we
know
or
know
about
well
i
do
want
marian
visiting
around
promiscuously
i
know
nothing
about
the
family
but
i
do
care
for
willing
and
we
had
enough
of
young
thatcher
marian
already
seen
too
much
of
him
allen
a
perfectly
nice
fellow
it
is
fair
to
dislike
him
on
his
father
account
allen
is
a
bit
like
his
father
but
even
if
he
were
you
used
to
think
well
enough
of
ed
thatcher
this
shot
was
well
aimed
and
bassett
blinked
but
he
felt
that
he
must
exercise
his
parental
authority
if
he
had
been
culpable
in
neglecting
blackford
he
could
still
take
a
hand
in
marian
affairs
so
i
did
he
replied
but
i
going
to
telegraph
marian
to
come
home
what
the
willings
address
oh
you
find
it
on
a
picture
postal
card
somewhere
about
i
write
marian
to
come
home
but
i
would
telegraph
if
i
were
you
morton
and
if
you
do
like
my
employing
miss
garrison
you
can
get
rid
of
her
i
merely
felt
that
had
to
be
done
i
turn
it
all
over
to
you
she
ended
mournfully
oh
i
have
no
objections
to
miss
garrison
we
see
how
blackford
gets
on
with
her
bassett
was
troubled
by
other
things
that
summer
than
his
education
harwood
declaration
of
war
in
the
white
river
canneries
matter
had
proved
wholly
disagreeable
and
fitch
had
not
been
able
to
promise
that
the
case
might
not
come
to
trial
to
discomfiture
it
was
a
hot
summer
and
bassett
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
his
office
at
the
boordman
building
where
harwood
name
no
longer
adorned
the
door
of
room
the
continued
to
lay
on
the
lash
for
his
defeat
of
the
appropriations
necessary
to
sustain
several
important
state
institutions
while
he
carried
through
his
corporation
bill
they
were
saying
in
some
quarters
that
he
had
lost
his
head
and
that
he
was
now
using
his
political
power
for
personal
warfare
upon
his
enemies
thatcher
loomed
formidably
as
a
candidate
for
the
leadership
and
many
predicted
that
bassett
power
was
at
last
broken
on
the
other
hand
bassett
old
lieutenants
smiled
knowingly
the
old
bassett
machine
was
still
in
perfect
running
order
they
said
as
thatcher
would
learn
when
he
felt
the
wheels
grinding
him
bassett
saw
sylvia
daily
and
he
was
wary
of
her
at
first
she
had
dealt
him
a
staggering
blow
that
rainy
evening
at
the
door
of
elizabeth
house
a
blow
which
from
her
had
an
effect
more
poignant
than
she
knew
that
incident
was
ended
however
and
he
felt
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
her
no
one
appreciates
candor
so
thoroughly
as
the
man
who
is
habitually
given
to
subterfuge
evasion
and
dissimulation
consent
to
tutor
blackford
indicated
a
kindly
feeling
toward
the
family
it
was
hardly
likely
that
she
would
report
to
bassett
his
indiscretions
with
rose
farrell
and
his
encounters
with
sylvia
had
moreover
encouraged
the
belief
that
she
viewed
life
broadly
and
tolerantly
there
was
little
for
a
man
of
bassett
tastes
to
do
at
waupegan
most
of
the
loungers
at
the
casino
were
elderly
men
who
played
bridge
which
he
despised
and
he
cared
little
for
fishing
or
boating
tennis
and
golf
did
not
tempt
him
his
wife
had
practically
ceased
to
be
a
figure
in
the
social
life
of
the
colony
marian
was
away
and
blackford
leisure
was
spent
with
boys
of
his
own
age
morton
bassett
was
lonely
it
thus
happened
that
he
looked
forward
with
growing
interest
to
sylvia
daily
visits
to
his
house
he
found
that
he
could
mark
her
progress
from
owen
gate
round
the
lake
to
his
own
cottage
from
the
window
of
a
den
he
maintained
in
the
attic
he
remained
there
under
the
hot
shingles
conscious
of
her
presence
in
his
house
throughout
her
two
hours
with
blackford
once
or
twice
he
took
himself
off
to
escape
from
her
but
on
these
occasions
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
back
on
the
veranda
when
sylvia
emerged
from
the
with
her
pupil
she
was
always
cheery
and
she
never
failed
to
say
something
heartening
of
blackford
work
a
number
of
trifling
incidents
occurred
to
bring
them
together
the
cook
left
abruptly
and
bassett
was
reduced
to
despair
bassett
gloomily
pacing
his
veranda
after
hearing
his
wife
arraignment
of
the
world
in
general
and
domestic
servants
in
particular
felt
the
clouds
lift
when
sylvia
came
down
from
a
voluntary
visit
to
the
invalid
he
watched
her
attack
the
problem
by
telephone
sensations
that
were
new
and
strange
and
sweet
assailed
him
as
he
sat
near
in
the
of
his
own
house
seeing
her
at
the
telephone
desk
by
the
window
hearing
her
voice
her
patience
in
the
necessary
delays
while
connection
was
made
with
the
city
her
courtesy
to
her
unseen
auditors
the
smile
the
occasional
word
she
flung
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
of
course
it
bothersome
but
all
will
soon
come
right
these
things
stirred
in
him
a
wistfulness
and
longing
such
as
the
hardy
oak
must
feel
when
the
south
wind
touches
its
bare
boughs
with
the
first
faint
breath
of
spring
it
all
arranged
fixed
accomplished
sylvia
reported
at
last
there
a
cook
coming
by
the
afternoon
train
you
attend
to
meeting
her
please
tell
bassett
it
senator
ridgefield
cook
available
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
as
the
family
have
gone
abroad
she
probably
good
the
agent
said
ridgefield
had
brought
her
from
washington
let
me
see
she
must
have
thursday
afternoon
off
and
a
chance
to
go
to
mass
on
sunday
and
you
of
course
stand
the
railroad
fare
to
and
from
the
lake
it
so
nominated
in
the
bond
she
dismissed
the
whole
matter
with
a
quick
gesture
of
her
hands
their
next
interview
touched
again
his
domestic
affairs
he
had
telegraphed
marian
to
come
home
without
eliciting
a
reply
and
the
next
day
he
found
in
a
chicago
newspaper
a
spirited
and
account
of
the
smashing
of
the
willings
automobile
in
a
collision
it
seemed
that
they
had
run
into
chicago
for
a
day
shopping
and
had
met
with
this
misadventure
on
one
of
the
boulevards
the
willings
chauffeur
had
been
seriously
injured
miss
marian
bassett
definitely
described
as
the
daughter
of
morton
bassett
the
indiana
politician
had
been
of
the
party
allen
thatcher
was
another
guest
of
the
willings
a
fact
which
added
to
bassett
anger
he
had
never
visited
his
hatred
of
thatcher
upon
allen
whom
he
had
regarded
as
a
harmless
boy
not
to
be
taken
seriously
but
the
conjunction
of
his
daughter
name
with
that
of
his
enemy
son
in
a
newspaper
of
wide
circulation
in
indiana
greatly
enraged
him
it
was
bound
to
occasion
talk
and
he
hated
publicity
the
willings
were
flashy
people
who
had
begun
to
spend
noisily
the
money
earned
for
them
by
an
automobile
patent
the
indictment
he
drew
against
marian
contained
many
counts
he
could
not
discuss
the
matter
with
his
wife
he
carefully
kept
from
her
the
newspaper
story
of
the
the
hotel
to
which
the
willings
had
retired
for
repairs
was
mentioned
and
bassett
resolved
to
go
to
chicago
and
bring
marian
home
the
best
available
train
passed
waupegan
station
at
midnight
and
he
sat
alone
on
his
veranda
that
evening
with
anger
against
marian
still
hot
in
his
heart
he
had
yet
to
apprise
bassett
of
his
intended
journey
delaying
the
moment
as
long
as
possible
to
minimize
her
inevitable
querulous
moanings
blackford
was
in
his
room
studying
and
bassett
had
grimly
paced
the
veranda
for
half
an
hour
when
the
nurse
came
down
with
a
request
that
he
desist
from
his
promenade
as
it
annoyed
bassett
in
her
chamber
above
he
thereupon
subsided
and
retired
to
the
darkest
corner
of
the
veranda
a
vigil
lay
before
him
and
he
derived
no
calm
from
the
still
stars
that
faintly
shadowed
the
quiet
waters
below
he
was
assailed
by
torments
reserved
for
those
who
having
long
made
others
writhe
without
caring
that
they
suffered
hear
the
swish
of
the
lash
over
their
own
heads
he
had
only
lately
been
conscious
of
his
growing
irritability
he
hated
men
who
yield
to
irritation
it
was
a
sign
of
weakness
a
failure
of
he
had
been
carried
on
by
a
strong
tide
imagining
that
he
controlled
it
and
guided
it
he
had
used
what
he
pleased
of
the
apparatus
of
life
and
when
any
part
of
the
mechanism
became
unnecessary
he
had
promptly
discarded
it
it
angered
him
to
find
that
he
had
thrown
away
so
much
that
the
mechanism
was
no
longer
as
responsive
as
it
had
been
the
very
peace
of
the
night
grated
upon
him
a
light
step
sounded
at
the
end
of
the
veranda
a
figure
in
white
was
moving
toward
the
door
and
recognizing
sylvia
he
rose
hastily
and
advanced
to
meet
her
is
that
you
bassett
i
ran
over
with
a
new
grammar
for
blackford
that
he
will
like
better
than
the
one
he
using
i
marked
his
lesson
so
he
can
look
it
over
before
i
come
in
the
morning
how
is
mrs
bassett
she
very
tired
and
nervous
wo
you
sit
down
thank
you
no
if
it
is
too
late
i
run
up
and
see
bassett
for
a
moment
i
think
you
better
not
the
nurse
is
trying
to
get
her
to
sleep
oh
then
of
course
i
sha
stop
and
sylvia
turned
to
go
how
soon
will
marian
be
home
evening
i
going
up
to
get
her
he
answered
harshly
you
are
going
to
the
willings
to
come
home
with
her
asked
sylvia
surprised
by
his
gruffness
he
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
you
did
see
papers
she
been
to
chicago
with
those
willings
and
their
machine
was
smashed
and
the
chauffeur
hurt
i
going
to
bring
her
back
she
had
no
business
to
be
visiting
the
willings
in
the
first
place
and
their
taking
her
to
chicago
without
our
consent
was
downright
impudence
i
do
want
bassett
to
know
of
the
accident
i
going
up
on
the
night
train
it
satisfied
his
turbulent
spirit
to
tell
her
this
he
had
blurted
it
out
without
attempting
to
conceal
the
anger
that
the
thought
of
marian
roused
in
him
she
was
hurt
we
should
be
glad
of
that
sylvia
lingered
her
hand
on
the
veranda
rail
she
seemed
very
tall
in
the
mellow
starlight
his
tone
had
struck
her
unpleasantly
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
anger
or
that
marian
would
feel
the
force
of
it
when
he
found
her
oh
she
was
hurt
he
answered
dully
it
very
unfortunate
that
she
was
mixed
up
in
it
i
suppose
she
ought
to
come
home
now
anyhow
the
point
is
that
she
should
never
have
gone
the
willings
are
not
the
kind
of
people
i
want
her
to
know
it
was
a
great
mistake
her
ever
going
yes
that
may
be
true
said
sylvia
quietly
i
do
believe
well
he
ejaculated
impatiently
as
though
anxious
for
her
to
speak
that
he
might
shatter
any
suggestion
she
made
before
she
came
he
had
sharply
vizualized
his
meeting
with
marian
and
the
willings
he
was
impatient
for
the
encounter
and
if
sylvia
projected
herself
in
the
path
of
his
righteous
anger
she
must
suffer
the
consequences
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
to
chicago
said
sylvia
calmly
i
think
your
going
for
marian
would
only
make
a
disagreeable
situation
worse
the
willings
may
not
be
desirable
companions
for
her
but
she
has
been
their
guest
and
the
motor
run
to
chicago
was
only
an
incident
of
the
visit
we
ought
to
be
grateful
that
marian
was
hurt
oh
you
think
so
you
do
know
that
her
mother
had
written
for
her
to
come
home
and
that
i
had
telegraphed
her
when
did
you
telegraph
her
asked
sylvia
standing
her
ground
yesterday
yesterday
morning
in
care
of
willing
at
his
farm
address
then
of
course
she
did
get
your
message
she
could
have
had
it
if
the
accident
happened
in
time
for
this
morning
chicago
papers
it
must
have
taken
them
all
day
to
get
from
their
place
to
chicago
if
she
had
been
at
the
willings
where
we
supposed
she
was
she
would
have
got
the
message
and
her
mother
had
written
twice
i
still
think
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake
in
all
the
circumstances
for
you
to
go
up
there
in
a
spirit
of
resentment
to
bring
marian
home
it
not
exactly
my
business
bassett
but
i
thinking
of
marian
and
you
could
hardly
keep
from
bassett
the
fact
that
you
went
for
marian
it
would
be
sure
to
distress
her
marian
needs
curbing
she
got
to
understand
that
she
ca
go
gallivanting
over
the
country
with
strangers
getting
her
name
in
the
newspapers
i
not
going
to
have
it
i
going
to
stop
her
nonsense
his
voice
had
risen
with
his
anger
sylvia
saw
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
argument
the
main
thing
is
to
bring
marian
home
is
it
mr
bassett
most
certainly
and
when
i
get
her
here
she
shall
stay
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
understand
of
course
that
you
want
her
back
but
i
hope
you
will
abandon
the
idea
of
going
for
her
yourself
please
give
that
up
i
promise
that
she
shall
come
home
i
can
easily
take
the
night
train
and
come
back
with
her
what
you
do
afterward
is
not
my
affair
but
somehow
i
think
this
is
please
agree
to
my
way
of
doing
it
i
can
manage
it
very
easily
owen
man
can
take
me
across
to
the
train
in
the
launch
i
sha
even
have
to
explain
about
it
to
her
if
you
rather
i
did
it
will
be
enough
if
i
tell
her
i
going
on
business
you
will
agree
wo
you
please
it
was
not
in
his
heart
to
consent
and
yet
he
consented
wondering
that
he
yielded
the
rescue
of
marian
from
the
willings
was
taken
out
of
his
hands
without
friction
and
there
remained
only
himself
against
whom
to
vent
his
anger
he
was
curiously
agitated
by
the
encounter
the
ironic
phrases
he
had
already
coined
for
marian
discomfiture
clinked
into
the
sylvia
was
turning
away
and
he
must
say
something
though
he
could
not
express
a
gratitude
he
did
not
feel
his
practical
sense
grasped
one
idea
feebly
he
felt
its
imbecility
the
moment
he
had
spoken
you
allow
me
of
course
to
pay
your
expenses
that
must
be
understood
sylvia
answered
over
her
shoulder
oh
yes
of
course
bassett
certainly
he
meant
to
accompany
her
to
owen
door
but
before
he
could
move
she
was
gone
running
along
the
path
a
white
figure
faintly
discernible
through
the
trees
he
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
end
of
the
veranda
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
her
and
waited
till
he
caught
across
the
quiet
night
the
faint
click
of
owen
gate
and
he
was
inexpressibly
lonely
now
that
she
had
gone
he
opened
the
door
of
the
and
found
his
wife
standing
like
an
accusing
angel
by
the
centre
table
she
loomed
tall
in
her
blue
with
her
brown
braids
falling
down
her
back
whom
were
you
talking
to
morton
she
demanded
with
ominous
severity
miss
garrison
came
over
to
bring
a
book
for
blackford
it
a
grammar
he
needed
in
his
work
he
held
up
the
book
in
proof
of
his
assertion
and
as
she
tossed
her
head
and
compressed
her
lips
he
flung
it
on
the
table
with
an
effort
to
appear
at
ease
she
wanted
him
to
have
it
before
his
lesson
in
the
morning
she
certainly
took
a
strange
time
to
bring
it
over
here
it
struck
me
as
very
kind
of
her

about
the
noise
you
were
making
on
the
veranda

not

hallie
miss
garrison

only
here
a
few
minutes
and
as
i
knew
noises
on
the
veranda
had
disturbed
you
i
tried
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
we
were
speaking
of
blackford
well
i
like
you
to
know
that
i
employed
that
girl
to
remedy
your
mistakes
in
trying
to
educate
blackford
and
if
she
has
any
report
to
make
she
can
make
it
to
me
very
well
then
it
was
only
a
few
days
ago
that
you
told
me
you
had
done
all
you
were
going
to
do
about
blackford

gave
me
to
understand
that
you
washed
your
hands

and
excited

unnecessarily

and
i
insist
that

asleep
and
you
need
bother
her
i
going
to
send
her
away
at
the
end
of
her
week
anyhow
she
the
worst
masseuse
i
ever
had
her
clumsiness
simply
drives
me
frantic
but
i
never
thought
you
would
treat
me
like
this
entertaining
a
young
woman
on
the
veranda
when
you
thought
i
was
asleep
and
out
of
the
way
i
astonished
at
miss
garrison
i
had
a
better
opinion
of
her
i
thought
she
knew
her
place
i
thought
she
understood
that
i
employed
her
out
of
kindness
and
abused
my
confidence
outrageously
you
ca
speak
that
way
of
that
young
woman
she
been
very
good
to
you
she
come
to
see
you
nearly
every
day
and
shown
you
many
kindnesses
it
is
kind
of
her
to
be
tutoring
blackford
at
all
when
she
came
to
the
lake
for
rest
for
rest
she
gulped
at
the
enormity
of
this
it
was
beyond
belief
that
any
intelligent
being
could
have
been
deceived
in
a
matter
that
was
as
plain
as
daylight
to
any
understanding
you
think
she
came
here
for
rest
do
you
know
that
she
hung
herself
around
aunt
sally
neck
and
that
she
filling
aunt
sally
head
with
all
manner
of
wild
ideas
she
been
after
aunt
sally
money
ever
since
she
saw
that
she
could
influence
her
did
you
ever
know
of
aunt
sally
taking
up
any
other
girl
has
she
ever
traveled
over
the
country
with
marian
or
shown
any
such
interest
in
her
own
flesh
and
blood
please
quiet
yourself
you
have
blackford
and
the
nurse
down
here
in
a
minute
you
know
perfectly
well
that
aunt
sally
started
elizabeth
house
long
before
she
had
ever
heard
of
this
girl
and
you
know
that
your
aunt
is
a
vigorous
independent
woman
who
is
not
led
around
by
anybody
her
nostrils
quivered
and
her
eyes
shone
with
tears
she
leveled
her
arm
at
him
rigidly
i
saw
you
walking
with
that
girl
yesterday
when
she
left
here
at
noon
you
came
down
from
the
den
and
walked
along
to
aunt
sally
gate
with
her
i
could
see
you
through
the
trees
from
my
bed
laughing
and
talking
with
her
i
suppose
it
was
then
you
arranged
for
her
to
come
and
sit
with
you
on
the
veranda
when
you
thought
i
was
asleep
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
seized
the
outstretched
hand
roughly
you
are
out
of
your
senses
or
you
would
speak
in
this
way
of
miss
garrison
she
been
a
kind
friend
to
you
all
summer
you
told
me
yourself
self
how
she
gone
up
to
brush
your
hair
and
do
little
things
for
you
that
the
nurse
could
do
as
well
you
grown
morbid
from
being
ill
so
long
but
nothing
was
ever
more
infamous
than
your
insinuations
against
miss
garrison
she
a
noble
girl
and
it
not
surprising
that
aunt
sally
should
like
her
everybody
likes
her
having
delivered
this
blow
he
settled
himself
more
firmly
on
his
feet
and
glared
everybody
likes
her
she
repeated
snatching
away
her
hand
i
like
to
know
how
you
come
to
know
so
much
about
her
i
know
enough
about
her
i
know
all
about
her
then
you
know
more
than
anybody
else
does
nobody
else
seems
to
know
about
her
she
ended
triumphantly
there
you
go
again
with
insinuations
it
ungenerous
it
unlike
you
morton
bassett
she
went
on
huskily
if
you
took
some
interest
in
your
own
children
it
would
be
more
to
your
credit
you
blamed
me
for
letting
marian
go
to
the
willings
and
then
telegraphed
for
her
to
come
home
it
a
beautiful
relationship
you
have
established
with
your
children
she
has
even
answered
your
telegram
but
i
suppose
if
she
had
you
have
kept
it
from
me
the
newspapers
talk
about
your
secretive
ways
but
they
do
know
you
morton
bassett
as
i
do
i
suppose
you
ca
imagine
yourself
entertaining
marian
on
the
veranda
or
walking
with
her
talking
and
laughing
as
i
saw
you
with
that
girl
well
thank
god
there
somebody
i
can
talk
and
laugh
with
i
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
marian
will
be
home
you
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
if
you
let
her
go
to
the
with
allen
thatcher
i
can
at
least
bring
her
back
after
you
failed
to
do
it
so
you
did
hear
from
her
did
you
of
course
you
could
have
told
me
i
suppose
you
confide
in
miss
garrison
now
she
ended
drearily
his
wife
fatigue
betrayed
in
her
tired
voice
did
not
mitigate
the
stab
with
which
he
wished
to
punish
her
references
to
sylvia
and
he
delivered
it
with
careful
calculation
you
are
quite
right
hallie
i
did
speak
to
miss
garrison
about
marian
miss
garrison
has
gone
to
bring
marian
home

all
go
to
bed
chapter
xxviii
a
cheerful
bringer
of
bad
tidings
the
announcement
that
harwood
was
preparing
to
attack
the
reorganization
of
the
white
river
canneries
corporation
renewed
the
hopes
of
many
victims
of
that
experiment
in
high
finance
and
most
of
the
claims
reached
dan
office
that
summer
the
legal
points
involved
were
sufficiently
difficult
to
evoke
his
best
energies
and
he
dug
diligently
in
the
state
library
preparing
his
case
he
was
enjoying
the
cool
calm
heights
of
a
new
freedom
many
older
men
were
eking
out
a
bare
living
at
the
law
and
the
ranks
were
sadly
overcrowded
but
he
faced
the
future
confidently
he
meant
to
practice
law
after
ideals
established
by
men
whose
names
were
still
potent
in
the
community
he
would
not
race
with
the
ambulance
to
pick
up
damage
suits
and
he
refused
divorce
cases
and
small
collection
business
he
meant
to
be
a
lawyer
not
a
detective
or
pursuer
of
small
debtors
with
a
process
he
tried
to
forget
politics
and
yet
in
spite
of
his
indifference
hardly
a
day
passed
that
did
not
bring
visitors
to
his
office
bent
upon
discussing
the
outlook
many
of
these
were
from
the
country
men
who
like
ramsay
were
hopeful
of
at
last
getting
rid
of
bassett
some
of
his
visitors
were
young
lawyers
like
himself
most
of
them
graduates
of
the
state
colleges
who
were
disposed
to
take
their
politics
seriously
nor
were
these
all
of
his
own
party
he
found
that
many
young
republicans
affected
by
the
prevailing
unrest
held
practically
his
own
views
on
national
questions
several
times
he
gathered
up
half
a
dozen
of
these
acquaintances
for
frugal
dinners
in
the
university
club
rathskeller
or
they
met
in
the
saloon
affected
by
allen
friends
of
lüders
carpenter
shop
he
wanted
them
to
see
all
sides
of
the
picture
and
he
encouraged
them
to
crystallize
their
fears
and
hopes
more
patriotism
and
less
partisanship
they
all
agreed
was
the
thing
most
needed
in
america
allen
appeared
in
dan
office
unexpectedly
one
hot
morning
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
piled
with
open
lawbooks
allen
had
benefited
by
his
sojourn
in
the
adirondacks
and
subsequent
cruises
in
his
motor
car
had
tanned
his
face
becomingly
he
was
far
from
rugged
but
he
declared
that
he
expected
to
live
forever
i
full
of
dark
tidings
much
has
happened
within
hours
see
about
our
in
chicago
must
have
read
it
in
the
newspapers
a
nice
odorous
mess
observed
dan
filling
his
pipe
i
pained
to
see
that
you
go
chasing
around
with
the
plutocrats
smashing
in
our
large
centres
of
population
that
sort
of
thing
is
bound
to
establish
your
reputation
as
the
friend
of
the
oppressed
was
the
chauffeur
funeral
largely
attended
pshaw
he
was
only
scratched
we
chucked
him
into
the
hospital
to
keep
him
from
being
arrested
that
was
all
look
here
old
man
you
seem
terribly
sympathetic
maybe
you
did
notice
that
it
was
car
that
got
smashed
it
looked
like
a
junk
dealer
back
yard
when
they
pulled
us
out
i
told
them
to
throw
it
into
the
lake
i
just
ordered
a
new
car
i
never
cared
for
that
one
much
anyhow
another
good
note
for
the
boys
around
lüders
joint
you
identified
forever
with
the
aristocrats
who
smash
five
thousand
dollar
motors
and
throw
them
away
you
better
go
out
in
the
hall
and
read
the
sign
on
the
door
i
a
lawyer
not
a
father
confessor
to
the
undeserving
rich
this
is
serious
dan
allen
remonstrated
twirling
his
straw
hat
nervously
all
that
happened
in
connection
with
the
did
get
into
the
newspapers
the
had
enough
of
it
they
printed
published
and
uttered
an
extra
with
marian
picture
next
to
yours
on
the
first
page
you
ca
complain
of
the
publicity
you
got
out
of
that
light
adventure
how
much
space
do
you
think
it
was
worth
stop
chaffing
and
hear
me
out
i
up
against
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
and
i
came
to
get
your
advice
you
see
dan
the
bassetts
did
know
marian
was
going
on
that
automobile
trip
her
mother
had
written
her
to
leave
the
willings
and
go
home
twice
and
her
father
telegraphed
after
we
left
the
farm
she
never
got
the
telegram
then
when
bassett
read
of
the
smash
in
the
papers
i
guess
he
was
warm
clear
through
you
know
he
does
cut
loose
very
often
and
and
he
jumped
on
the
train
and
went
to
chicago
to
snatch
marian
away
from
the
willings
i
should
think
he
would
have
done
just
that
no
oh
no
he
sent
sylvia
cried
allen
sylvia
came
up
on
the
night
train
had
a
few
words
privately
with
marian
took
luncheon
with
the
willings
all
as
nice
as
you
please
and
off
she
went
with
marian
harwood
pressed
his
thumb
into
his
and
puffed
in
silence
for
a
moment
allen
satisfied
that
he
had
at
last
caught
his
attention
fanned
himself
furiously
with
his
hat
well
said
dan
finally
there
nothing
so
staggering
in
that
sylvia
been
staying
at
the
lake
i
suppose
bassett
must
have
asked
her
to
go
up
and
bring
marian
home
when
the
papers
screamed
her
daughter
name
in
red
ink
i
understand
that
bassett
ill
and
i
suppose
bassett
did
like
to
leave
her
there
nothing
fuddlesome
in
that
sylvia
probably
did
the
job
well
she
has
the
habit
what
is
there
that
troubles
you
about
it
allen
his
heart
had
warmed
at
the
mention
of
sylvia
and
he
felt
more
kindly
toward
allen
now
that
she
had
flashed
across
his
vision
many
times
a
day
he
found
sylvia
looking
up
at
him
from
the
pages
of
his
books
this
fresh
news
brought
her
near
sylvia
journey
to
chicago
argued
an
intimacy
with
the
bassetts
that
he
did
not
reconcile
with
his
knowledge
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
family
he
was
aroused
by
the
light
touch
of
allen
hand
on
his
knee
the
young
man
bent
toward
him
with
a
bright
light
in
his
eyes
you
know
he
said
marian
and
i
are
engaged
you
what
bellowed
dan
we
engaged
old
man
we
engaged
it
happened
there
at
the
willings
you
know
i
think
i
loved
her
from
the
very
first
time
i
saw
her
it
the
beautifullest
thing
that
ever
came
into
my
life
you
know
how
happy
i
am
it
the
kind
of
happiness
that
makes
you
want
to
cry
oh
you
do
know
nobody
could
ever
know
dan
rose
and
paced
the
floor
while
allen
stood
watching
him
eagerly
and
pouring
his
heart
out
dan
felt
that
tragedy
loomed
here
he
did
not
doubt
allen
sincerity
he
was
not
unmoved
by
his
manner
his
voluble
description
of
all
the
phases
of
his
happiness
allen
with
all
his
faults
and
weaknesses
had
nevertheless
a
sound
basis
of
character
harwood
affection
for
him
dated
from
that
first
encounter
in
the
lonely
meridian
street
house
when
the
boy
had
dawned
upon
him
in
his
overalls
and
red
silk
stockings
he
had
never
considered
interest
in
marian
serious
for
allen
had
to
dan
knowledge
paid
similar
attentions
to
half
a
dozen
other
girls
allen
imagination
made
a
goddess
of
every
pretty
girl
and
dan
had
settled
down
to
the
belief
that
his
friend
saw
in
marian
only
one
of
the
many
dianas
visible
in
the
city
thoroughfares
whom
he
invested
with
deific
charms
and
apostrophized
in
glowing
phrases
but
that
he
should
marry
marian
marian
the
joyous
and
headstrong
marian
the
romping
careless
thalia
of
allen
bright
galaxy
she
was
for
marriage
particularly
to
a
dreamy
emotional
youngster
like
allen
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
if
she
had
arrived
at
a
real
appreciation
of
fineness
and
gentleness
and
had
felt
his
sweetness
and
charm
why
not
dan
common
sense
told
him
that
quite
apart
from
the
young
people
themselves
there
were
reasons
enough
against
it
dan
had
imagined
that
allen
was
content
to
play
at
being
in
love
that
it
satisfied
the
romantic
strain
in
him
just
as
his
idealization
of
the
great
experiment
and
its
actors
expressed
and
satisfied
his
patriotic
feelings
the
news
that
he
had
come
to
terms
of
marriage
with
marian
was
in
all
the
circumstances
dismaying
and
opened
many
dark
prospects
allen
stood
at
the
window
staring
across
the
roofs
beyond
he
whirled
round
as
dan
addressed
him
have
you
spoken
to
bassett
you
know
that
will
be
the
first
thing
allen
that
exactly
what
i
want
you
to
help
me
about
he
at
waupegan
now
and
of
course
i
got
to
see
him
but
you
know
this
row
between
him
and
dad
makes
it
hard
you
know
dad
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
me
dear
old
dad
of
course
i
told
and
you
be
surprised
to
see
the
way
he
took
it
you
know
people
do
know
dad
the
way
i
do
they
think
he
just
a
rough
old
chap
without
any
fine
feeling
about
anything
and
mother
and
the
girls
leaving
him
that
way
has
hurt
him
it
hurts
him
a
whole
lot
and
when
i
told
him
last
night
up
at
that
big
hollow
cave
of
a
house
how
happy
i
was
and
all
that
it
broke
him
all
up
he
cried
you
know
dad
cried
the
thought
of
edward
thatcher
in
tears
failed
to
arrest
the
dark
apprehensions
that
tramped
harshly
through
dan
mind
as
for
bassett
dan
recalled
his
quondam
chief
occasional
flings
at
allen
whom
the
senator
from
fraser
had
regarded
as
a
spoiled
and
erratic
but
innocuous
trifler
bassett
dan
was
aware
valued
her
social
position
highly
as
the
daughter
of
blackford
singleton
she
considered
herself
unassailably
a
member
of
the
upper
crust
of
the
hoosier
aristocracy
and
dan
suspected
that
bassett
also
harbored
similar
notions
of
caste
independently
of
the
struggle
in
progress
between
thatcher
and
bassett
it
was
quite
likely
that
the
bassetts
would
look
askance
at
the
idea
of
a
union
between
their
daughter
and
edward
thatcher
son
no
matter
what
might
be
said
in
allen
favor
bassett
social
acceptance
was
fairly
complete
and
he
enjoyed
meeting
men
of
distinction
he
was
invariably
welcomed
to
the
feasts
of
reason
we
are
always
in
our
capital
proffering
to
the
great
and
good
of
all
lands
who
pause
for
enlightenment
and
inspiration
in
our
empurpled
athens
he
was
never
ignored
in
the
choice
of
those
and
committees
that
meet
all
trains
at
the
union
station
and
quadrennially
welcome
home
our
eternal
candidates
for
the
joyous
office
of
of
the
republic
he
kept
his
dress
suit
packed
for
flight
at
fraserville
free
of
that
delicate
scent
of
camphor
that
sweetens
the
air
of
provincial
festivals
thatcher
never
to
the
righteous
sensitive
local
consciousness
wholly
escaped
from
the
taint
in
itself
horrible
and
shocking
nor
did
his
patronage
of
budding
genius
in
the
prize
ring
or
his
adventures
often
noisily
heralded
as
a
financial
pillar
of
comic
opera
tend
to
change
or
hide
the
spots
in
a
community
where
the
ten
commandments
have
yet
been
declared
unconstitutional
save
by
plumbers
and
paperhangers
women
who
had
never
in
their
lives
seen
thatcher
admired
her
for
remaining
in
exile
they
knew
she
must
be
delectable
phrase
a
good
woman
you
know
dad
has
had
an
awful
lonely
time
of
it
dan
and
if
he
has
done
things
that
have
sounded
nice
he
as
sorry
as
anybody
could
ask
you
know
dad
never
made
a
cent
in
his
life
at
poker
and
his
horses
have
come
near
busting
him
lots
of
times
and
sentiment
against
breweries
over
here
would
astonish
people
abroad
it
that
old
puritan
strain
you
know
you
understand
all
that
dan
dan
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
it
was
hardly
less
than
funny
to
attempt
a
defense
of
ed
thatcher
by
invoking
the
shades
of
the
puritans
but
thatcher
did
love
his
boy
and
dan
had
always
given
him
full
credit
for
that
never
mind
the
breweries
tell
me
the
rest
of
it
well
allen
continued
dad
always
tells
me
everything
and
when
i
spoke
of
marian
he
told
me
a
lot
of
things
he
wants
to
put
bassett
out
of
business
and
go
to
the
senate
dad
set
his
heart
on
that
i
know
that
any
man
could
hate
another
as
he
hates
bassett
that
business
in
the
state
convention
cut
him
deep
no
do
you
say
a
word
dad
has
any
feeling
against
you
he
thinks
you
a
fine
fellow
and
he
likes
to
feel
that
when
you
quit
bassett
you
put
yourself
on
his
side
maybe
he
wrong
but
just
for
my
sake
i
want
you
to
let
him
think
so
but
he
got
it
in
for
bassett
he
got
his
guns
all
loaded
and
primed
dad
deeper
than
you
think
they
used
to
say
that
dad
was
only
second
fiddle
to
bassett
but
you
see
that
dad
knows
a
thing
or
two
dan
drummed
his
desk
this
reference
to
thatcher
ambitions
only
kindled
his
anger
and
he
wished
that
allen
would
end
his
confidences
and
take
himself
off
but
he
pricked
up
his
ears
as
allen
went
on
i
telling
you
this
just
to
show
you
how
it
mixes
up
things
for
marian
and
me
i
came
to
you
for
help
old
man
and
i
want
you
to
see
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
go
to
bassett
and
tell
him
i
want
to
marry
marian
just
a
minute
allen
are
you
quite
sure
that
marian
has
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
you
that
she
really
wants
to
marry
anybody
i
tell
you
it
all
fixed
you
do
imply
that
marian
is
merely
amusing
herself
at
my
expense
it
would
be
like
you
to
think
that
i
have
always
thought
you
liked
marian
and
saw
how
superb
she
is
of
course
i
like
marian
said
dan
hastily
my
one
hope
is
that
both
of
you
will
be
happy
and
the
difficulties
you
have
suggested
only
make
that
more
important
you
will
have
to
wait
i
not
sure
but
that
you
had
better
keep
this
to
yourselves
for
a
while
maybe
for
a
long
time
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
talk
to
aunt
sally
she
a
good
friend
of
yours
and
one
of
the
wisest
of
women
it
was
not
in
allen
eye
that
he
sought
wisdom
with
him
as
with
most
people
who
ask
advice
advice
was
the
last
thing
he
wanted
it
was
his
way
to
unbosom
himself
however
and
he
forged
ahead
with
his
story
with
what
seemed
to
harwood
a
maddening
failure
to
appreciate
its
sinister
import
you
remember
that
when
we
were
up
there
on
the
kankakee
john
ware
told
a
story
one
night
a
mighty
good
story
about
an
experience
he
had
once
yes
he
told
a
lot
of
stories
which
one
do
you
mean
oh
the
best
one
of
all
about
the
woman
in
the
adirondacks
you
have
forgotten
that
no
i
do
remember
something
about
it
you
may
not
have
noticed
that
while
ware
was
telling
the
story
dad
got
up
from
the
bed
in
the
corner
and
walked
over
to
the
stove
after
ware
had
asked
you
it
was
you
was
it
to
reach
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
over
your
head
and
get
the
book
he
was
talking
about
it
was
you
he
spoke
to
was
it
yes
it
comes
back
to
me
now
replied
dan
frowning
well
i
remember
because
it
struck
me
as
odd
that
dad
should
be
interested
it
was
emerson
you
know
and
dad
looked
at
the
book
in
the
light
from
the
stove
and
asked
me
what
the
name
was
down
in
the
inside
of
the
cover
it
was
the
binder
name
in
small
letters
fenelsa
well
there
a
long
story
about
that
it
a
horrible
story
to
know
about
any
man
but
dad
had
been
trying
to
find
something
he
could
use
on
bassett
he
had
people
the
sort
you
can
get
to
do
such
jobs
going
over
bassett
whole
life
to
find
material
dad
says
there
always
something
in
every
man
life
that
he
wants
to
hide
and
that
if
you
keep
looking
you
can
find
it
you
see
i
do
like
to
see
growled
harwood
it
an
ugly
idea
and
then
with
sudden
scorn
for
thatcher
views
on
man
frailty
he
said
with
emphasis
now
allen
it
all
right
for
you
to
talk
to
me
about
marian
and
your
wish
to
marry
her
but
do
mix
scandal
up
in
it
not
for
that
i
do
want
to
hear
any
stories
of
that
kind
about
bassett
politics
is
rotten
enough
at
best
without
tipping
over
the
garbage
can
to
find
arguments
i
do
believe
your
father
is
going
to
stoop
to
that
to
be
real
frank
with
you
i
do
think
he
can
afford
to
you
got
to
hear
it
you
ca
desert
me
now
i
away
up
in
the
air
this
morning
and
even
if
you
do
hate
this
kind
of
thing
you
got
to
see
where
dad
hatred
of
bassett
puts
marian
and
me
it
puts
you
clean
out
of
it
away
over
the
ropes
and
halfway
home
that
where
it
puts
you
boomed
harwood
well
you
got
to
listen
and
you
got
to
tell
me
what
to
do
dad
had
already
investigated
bassett
years
in
new
york
when
he
was
a
young
man
studying
in
the
law
school
down
there
but
they
could
get
about
so
far
and
no
farther
it
a
long
time
ago
and
all
the
people
bassett
knew
at
that
time
had
scattered
to
the
far
corners
of
the
earth
but
that
book
struck
dad
all
of
a
heap
it
fitted
into
what
he
had
heard
about
bassett
as
a
dilettante
book
collector
even
then
bassett
was
interested
in
such
things
and
you
know
in
that
account
of
him
you
wrote
in
the
that
i
told
you
i
had
read
on
the
other
side
that
first
time
we
met
well
when
dad
and
i
went
to
the
adirondacks
it
was
only
partly
on
my
account
he
met
a
man
up
there
who
had
been
working
up
bassett
past
and
dad
went
over
all
the
ground
himself
it
was
most
amazing
that
it
should
all
come
out
that
way
but
he
found
the
place
and
the
same
man
is
still
living
at
the
house
where
the
strange
woman
stayed
that
ware
told
about
i
know
it
just
as
rotten
as
it
can
be
but
dad
sure
bassett
was
the
man
who
took
that
woman
there
and
deserted
her
it
fits
into
a
period
when
bassett
was
in
new
york
and
he
was
at
fraserville
they
found
an
old
file
of
the
fraserville
paper
at
the
state
library
that
mentions
the
fact
that
bassett
father
was
very
ill
had
a
stroke
and
they
had
hard
work
locating
bassett
who
was
the
only
child
there
only
one
missing
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
and
that
the
woman
herself
and
her
child
that
was
born
up
there
ware
told
us
that
night
how
he
failed
to
get
track
of
them
later
and
dad
lost
the
trail
right
there
too
but
that
all
i
need
tell
you
about
it
that
what
i
got
hanging
over
me
and
dad
wo
promise
not
to
use
it
on
bassett
if
he
has
to
harwood
face
had
gone
white
but
he
smiled
and
knit
his
fingers
together
behind
his
head
with
an
air
of
nonchalance
that
he
did
not
feel
he
knew
that
thatcher
meant
to
drive
bassett
out
of
politics
but
he
had
little
faith
in
thatcher
ability
to
do
so
he
discredited
wholly
the
story
allen
had
so
glibly
recited
by
allen
own
admission
the
tale
was
deficient
in
what
harwood
lawyer
instinct
told
him
were
essentials
the
idea
that
bassett
could
ever
have
been
so
stupid
as
to
leave
traces
of
any
imaginable
iniquities
plain
enough
for
thatcher
to
find
them
after
many
years
was
preposterous
the
spectacle
of
the
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
never
edifying
aroused
dan
ire
against
thatcher
and
bassett
was
not
that
sort
his
old
liking
for
the
man
stirred
to
life
again
even
the
rose
farrell
incident
did
not
support
this
wretched
tissue
of
fabrication
he
had
hated
bassett
for
that
but
it
was
not
for
the
peccable
thatcher
to
point
a
mocking
finger
at
achilles
heel
well
said
allen
impatiently
well
dan
blurted
contemptuously
i
think
your
father
stooped
pretty
low
that
all
you
can
tell
him
for
me
that
if
he
digging
in
the
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
done
with
him
i
not
only
done
with
him
but
if
he
attempts
to
use
any
such
stuff
as
that
fight
him
i
will
raise
a
war
on
him
that
wo
be
forgotten
in
this
state
through
all
eternity
you
tell
him
that
tell
him
you
told
me
your
story
and
that
what
i
said
about
it
but
dan
old
man
began
allen
pleadingly
harwood
shook
his
head
until
his
cowlick
bobbed
and
danced
you
better
get
out
of
here
allen
if
you
think
you
can
marry
morton
bassett
daughter
with
that
kind
of
a
scandal
in
your
pocket
i
tell
you
you
mad
you
plumb
gone
insane
great
god
boy
you
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
you
use
you
handle
that
thing
like
a
child
with
a
loaded
pistol
do
you
see
what
that
would
mean
to
marian
to
blackford
to
bassett
to
aunt
sally
now
you
want
my
advice
or
you
said
you
did
and
i
going
to
give
you
some
you
go
right
down
to
that
bank
over
there
on
the
corner
and
buy
a
steamer
ticket
and
a
long
letter
of
credit
then
take
the
first
train
for
new
york
and
go
back
to
your
mother
and
stay
there
till
i
send
for
you
to
come
home
i
mean
that
every
word
of
it
if
you
do
skip
i
damned
if
i
do
go
to
bassett
and
tell
him
this
whole
rotten
story
allen
the
tears
glistening
in
his
frightened
eyes
turned
toward
the
door
dan
old
man
i
sorry
it
had
to
end
this
way
disappointed
that
all
he
paused
after
opening
the
door
hoping
to
be
called
back
but
harwood
had
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
into
the
street
chapter
xxix
a
song
and
a
falling
star
this
was
on
friday
and
harwood
took
the
afternoon
train
for
waupegan
he
had
found
that
when
he
was
tired
or
lonely
or
troubled
he
craved
the
sight
of
sylvia
sylvia
alone
could
restore
his
equanimity
sylvia
who
worked
hard
but
never
complained
of
weariness
sylvia
who
saw
life
steadily
and
saw
it
whole
where
he
caught
only
fitful
distorted
glimpses
yes
he
must
see
sylvia
not
only
must
he
see
her
but
there
were
things
he
meant
to
say
to
her
he
needed
sylvia
for
several
months
he
had
been
sure
of
that
he
loved
her
and
he
meant
to
marry
her
since
leaving
college
he
had
indulged
in
several
more
or
less
ardent
flirtations
but
they
had
ended
harmlessly
it
was
very
different
with
sylvia
he
had
realized
all
that
spring
that
she
was
becoming
increasingly
necessary
to
him
he
needed
her
solace
and
her
inspiration
he
thrust
one
or
two
new
books
on
the
prevailing
social
unrest
into
his
suit
case
and
added
a
box
of
candy
smiling
at
the
combination
sylvia
with
all
her
ideals
was
still
so
beautifully
human
she
was
quite
capable
of
nibbling
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
vivacious
discussion
of
the
sorrows
of
the
world
he
had
seen
her
do
just
that
with
her
ideals
of
life
and
service
she
would
not
be
easily
won
but
he
was
in
the
race
to
win
yes
there
were
things
he
meant
to
say
to
sylvia
and
in
the
tedious
journey
through
the
hot
afternoon
to
waupegan
he
formulated
them
and
visualized
the
situations
in
which
he
should
utter
them
dan
reached
waupegan
at
six
and
went
to
one
of
the
little
inns
at
the
lakeside
near
the
village
he
got
into
his
flannels
ate
supper
and
set
off
for
owen
with
his
offerings
on
the
seven
boat
in
the
old
days
of
his
intimacy
with
bassett
he
had
often
visited
waupegan
and
the
breach
between
them
introduced
an
element
of
embarrassment
into
his
visit
he
was
very
likely
to
meet
his
former
chief
who
barely
bowed
to
him
now
when
they
met
in
hotels
or
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
jumping
aboard
the
steamer
just
as
it
was
pulling
out
he
at
once
saw
bassett
sitting
alone
in
the
bow
there
were
only
a
few
other
passengers
and
hearing
dan
step
on
the
deck
behind
him
bassett
turned
slightly
nodded
and
then
resumed
his
inspection
of
the
farther
shore
lines
a
light
overcoat
lay
across
his
knees
and
the
protruding
newspapers
explained
his
visit
to
the
village
dan
found
a
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
deck
resolved
to
accept
bassett
own
definition
of
their
relations
markedly
expressed
in
bassett
back
and
shoulders
that
were
stolidly
presented
to
him
dan
searching
out
the
lights
that
were
just
beginning
to
blink
on
the
darkling
shores
found
the
glimmering
lanterns
of
owen
landing
sylvia
was
there
it
was
sylvia
he
had
come
to
see
and
the
coldness
with
which
morton
bassett
turned
his
back
upon
him
did
not
matter
in
the
least
it
was
his
pliability
in
bassett
hands
manifested
at
the
convention
where
he
had
appeared
as
the
boss
spokesman
that
had
earned
him
sylvia
first
rebuke
he
was
thinking
of
this
and
of
sylvia
when
bassett
left
his
chair
and
crossed
the
deck
dan
barely
turned
his
head
thinking
he
was
merely
changing
his
seat
for
a
better
view
but
as
bassett
stopped
in
front
of
him
dan
rose
and
pushed
forward
a
chair
no
thank
you
i
suppose
you
came
up
on
the
evening
train
i
just
wondered
whether
you
saw
fitch
no
sir
i
did
see
him
i
did
know
he
wanted
to
see
me
he
was
here
yesterday
and
probably
had
had
time
to
see
you
before
you
left
town
he
had
a
proposition
to
make
in
that
canneries
case
i
did
know
that
of
course
or
i
should
have
waited
i
never
had
any
talk
with
him
about
the
canneries
business
so
he
said
bassett
clapped
his
hand
savagely
upon
his
hat
suddenly
to
save
it
from
the
breeze
that
had
been
roused
by
the
increasing
speed
of
the
boat
he
clearly
disliked
having
to
hold
his
hat
on
his
head
dan
marked
his
old
chief
irritation
there
were
deep
lines
in
bassett
face
that
had
only
lately
been
written
there
i
see
him
monday
i
only
ran
up
for
a
day
or
two
it
frightfully
hot
at
home
neither
the
heat
nor
harwood
enterprise
in
escaping
from
it
interested
bassett
who
lifted
his
voice
above
the
thumping
of
the
machinery
to
say
i
told
fitch
to
talk
to
you
about
that
suit
of
yours
and
fix
it
up
if
we
can
come
to
terms
i
told
him
what
i
stand
for
i
not
afraid
of
the
suit
and
neither
is
fitch
and
i
want
you
to
understand
that
my
reasons
for
getting
rid
of
it
are
quite
apart
from
the
legal
questions
it
will
save
time
bassett
if
you
tell
fitch
that
the
suit
be
dropped
until
all
the
claims
i
represent
are
paid
in
full
several
of
your
associates
in
the
reorganization
have
already
sounded
me
on
that
and
i
said
no
to
all
of
them
oh
you
have
have
you
there
was
a
hard
glitter
in
bassett
eyes
and
his
jaws
tightened
all
right
then
go
ahead
he
added
and
walked
grimly
back
to
his
chair
when
the
steamer
stopped
at
his
landing
bassett
jumped
off
and
began
the
ascent
to
his
house
without
looking
at
harwood
again
dan
felt
that
it
had
been
worth
the
journey
to
hear
direct
from
bassett
the
intimations
of
a
wish
to
compromise
the
canneries
case
and
yet
while
the
boat
was
backing
off
it
was
without
exultation
that
he
watched
bassett
sturdy
figure
slowly
climbing
the
steps
the
signs
of
wear
the
loss
of
the
politician
old
elasticity
touched
a
chord
of
pity
in
harwood
breast
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
bassett
could
never
be
beaten
and
yet
dan
had
read
defeat
in
his
face
and
manner
the
old
morton
bassett
would
never
have
yielded
an
inch
never
have
made
overtures
of
compromise
he
would
have
emerged
triumphant
from
any
disaster
harwood
experienced
something
of
the
sensations
of
a
sculptor
who
having
begun
a
heroic
figure
in
the
grand
manner
of
a
michael
angelo
finds
his
model
shrinking
to
a
pitiful
pygmy
as
bassett
passed
from
sight
he
turned
with
a
sigh
toward
the
red
white
and
blue
lanterns
that
advertised
owen
dock
to
the
mariner
well
well
if
it
is
daniel
exclaimed
owen
as
harwood
greeted
her
and
sylvia
on
her
veranda
one
of
the
farm
hands
quit
and
you
can
go
to
work
in
the
morning
daniel
not
if
i
strong
enough
to
run
aunt
sally
i
going
to
have
hours
vacation
if
i
starve
to
death
the
rest
of
my
life
rose
farrell
had
told
him
that
owen
was
entertaining
the
elizabeth
house
girls
in
installments
and
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
veranda
filled
with
young
women
some
of
them
he
knew
and
sylvia
introduced
him
to
the
others
when
rose
coming
up
asked
sylvia
balancing
herself
on
the
veranda
rail
you
know
she
expected
do
i
know
she
expected
did
i
have
a
note
from
you
aunt
sally
ordering
me
to
send
her
up
she
coming
just
as
soon
as
i
get
back
but
i
think
of
staying
forever
a
man
has
come
and
he
come
to
stay
forever
murmured
one
of
the
young
women
oh
you
an
event
laughed
sylvia
but
do
expect
us
to
spoil
you
the
sport
for
is
tomato
pickles
and
the
man
who
skipped
left
because
aunt
sally
wanted
him
to
help
scald
and
peel
the
tomats
your
job
is
cut
out
for
you
all
right
he
replied
humbly
i
do
anything
you
say
but
plough
or
cut
wood
my
enchanted
youth
on
the
farm
was
filled
with
those
delights
and
before
i
go
back
to
that
a
swift
marathon
runner
must
trip
me
he
was
aware
presently
that
one
by
one
the
girls
were
slipping
away
he
saw
them
through
the
windows
settling
themselves
at
the
round
table
of
the
where
owen
was
reading
a
newspaper
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
when
he
and
sylvia
found
themselves
alone
i
have
scarlet
fever
or
anything
he
remarked
noting
the
flight
with
satisfaction
i
suppose
we
might
go
inside
too
suggested
sylvia
obtusely
oh
i
came
up
for
the
fresh
air
most
of
my
nights
lately
have
been
spent
in
a
hot
office
with
not
even
a
june
bug
for
company
how
are
the
neighbors
the
bassetts
oh
bassett
is
not
at
all
well
marian
is
at
home
now
blackford
is
tutoring
and
getting
ready
to
take
the
annapolis
examinations
the
first
chance
he
gets
i
saw
allen
he
remarked
carelessly
she
said
nothing
he
moved
his
chair
nearer
he
told
me
things
that
scared
me
to
death
among
others
that
he
and
marian
are
engaged
yes
marian
told
me
that
ah
she
really
takes
it
seriously
does
she
yes
she
takes
it
seriously
why
should
she
it
the
first
time
she
ever
took
anything
seriously
that
all
please
do
speak
of
her
like
that
dan
you
know
she
and
i
are
friends
and
i
thought
you
and
she
were
friends
too
she
always
speaks
of
you
in
the
very
kindest
way
your
leaving
bassett
did
make
any
difference
with
her
and
you
are
the
greatest
of
blackford
heroes
next
to
nelson
and
farragut
dan
laughed
so
it
is
napoleon
and
grant
and
custer
any
more
i
glad
settled
down
to
something
he
a
fine
boy
with
a
lot
of
the
right
stuff
in
him
we
been
having
some
lessons
together
tutoring
blackford
you
have
to
explain
the
psychological
processes
that
brought
that
about
oh
they
simple
enough
he
had
done
well
in
school
last
year
bassett
was
troubled
about
it
i
take
him
for
a
couple
of
hours
every
morning
bassett
engaged
me
and
bassett
approved
of
the
plan
allen
probably
told
you
all
the
news
but
he
did
know
just
how
i
came
to
go
to
chicago
cago
to
bring
marian
home
it
was
to
keep
the
news
of
that
automobile
smash
from
bassett
and
to
save
own
dignity
with
the
willings
oh
you
went
at
her
father
instance
did
you
yes
i
offered
to
go
when
i
found
that
he
was
very
angry
and
likely
to
deal
severely
and
ungenerously
with
marian
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
you
taken
the
bassetts
on
your
shoulders
i
did
suppose
aunt
sally
would
stand
for
that
aunt
sally
does
know
why
i
went
to
chicago
i
assume
bassett
knows
i
went
to
bring
marian
home
but
i
do
know
what
bassett
told
her
about
it
and
i
have
seen
her
since
it
possible
my
going
may
have
displeased
her
blackford
came
here
for
his
lessons
this
morning
dan
moved
uneasily
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
bassetts
did
not
interest
him
save
as
they
involved
sylvia
it
was
like
sylvia
to
help
them
out
of
their
scrapes
but
sylvia
was
not
a
person
that
he
could
scold
or
abuse
you
needed
rest
and
it
too
bad
you
had
to
bother
with
their
troubles
bassett
was
on
the
boat
as
i
came
over
he
had
a
grouch
he
does
look
like
a
happy
man
i
do
suppose
he
is
altogether
happy
and
i
begged
marian
not
to
tell
him
she
wants
to
marry
allen
that
would
certainly
not
cheer
him
any
right
now
i
glad
you
had
a
chance
to
do
that
i
told
allen
to
skip
right
out
for
europe
and
hang
on
to
his
mother
apron
strings
till
i
send
for
him
this
old
capulet
and
montague
business
does
ring
quite
true
in
this
twentieth
century
there
something
unreal
about
it
and
just
what
those
youngsters
can
see
in
each
other
is
beyond
me
you
must
be
fair
about
that
we
have
any
right
to
question
their
sincerity
oh
allen
is
sincere
enough
but
you
have
to
show
me
the
documents
on
marian
side
of
it
she
sees
in
the
situation
a
great
lark
the
fact
that
her
father
and
thatcher
are
enemies
appeals
to
her
romantic
instincts
i
think
better
of
it
than
that
dan
she
a
fine
strong
loyal
girl
with
a
lot
of
hard
common
sense
but
that
does
relieve
the
situation
of
its
immediate
dangers
she
promised
me
not
to
speak
to
her
father
yet
not
until
she
has
my
consent
when
i
see
that
it
ca
be
helped
i
going
to
speak
to
mr
bassett
about
it
myself
you
seem
to
be
the
good
angel
of
the
bassett
household
he
remarked
sullenly
a
lover
jealousy
stirred
in
his
heart
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
sylvia
as
preoccupied
with
the
affairs
of
others
and
he
saw
no
peace
or
happiness
ahead
for
marian
and
allen
it
all
more
wretched
than
you
imagine
this
war
between
thatcher
and
bassett
has
passed
the
bounds
of
mere
political
rivalry
there
an
implacable
hatred
there
that
got
to
take
its
course
allen
told
me
of
it
this
morning
when
he
was
trying
to
enlist
me
in
his
cause
with
marian
it
hideous
a
perfectly
rotten
mess
thatcher
is
preparing
a
poisoned
arrow
for
bassett
he
raked
up
an
old
scandal
an
affair
with
a
woman
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
to
think
of
its
possibilities
but
thatcher
would
do
such
a
thing
he
might
threaten
but
he
would
really
use
that
sort
of
weapon
you
do
know
the
man
sylvia
he
will
risk
anything
to
break
bassett
down
there
nothing
respectable
about
thatcher
but
his
love
for
allen
and
that
does
redeem
everything
but
you
wo
let
it
come
to
that
you
have
influence
enough
yourself
to
stop
it
even
if
you
hated
him
you
would
protect
bassett
and
the
children
i
could
do
nothing
of
the
kind
sylvia
now
that
i
left
bassett
my
influence
has
vanished
utterly
besides
i
out
of
politics
i
hate
the
game
it
rotten
rotten
clean
through
i
do
believe
it
quite
true
that
you
have
lost
your
influence
i
read
the
newspapers
and
some
of
them
are
saying
that
you
are
the
hope
of
your
party
and
that
you
have
a
large
following
but
you
would
do
that
dan
you
would
lend
yourself
to
such
a
thing
as
that
i
not
so
sure
he
replied
doggedly
angry
that
they
should
be
discussing
the
subject
at
all
though
to
be
sure
he
had
introduced
it
a
man
family
has
got
to
suffer
for
his
acts
it
a
part
of
the
punishment
i
like
to
see
bassett
driven
out
of
politics
but
i
assure
you
that
i
do
mean
to
do
it
there
no
possibility
of
my
having
the
chance
he
put
me
in
the
legislature
to
use
me
and
i
glad
that
all
over
as
i
tell
you
i
out
of
the
game
i
do
sympathize
with
that
at
all
dan
you
not
only
ought
to
stay
in
but
you
ought
to
do
all
you
can
to
make
it
impossible
for
men
like
bassett
and
thatcher
to
have
any
power
the
honor
of
the
state
ought
to
be
dear
to
all
of
us
and
if
i
belonged
to
a
party
i
think
i
should
have
a
care
for
its
honor
too
the
time
was
passing
it
was
not
to
discuss
politics
that
he
had
gone
to
waupegan
come
he
said
let
find
a
canoe
and
get
out
under
the
stars
sylvia
went
for
a
wrap
and
they
had
soon
embarked
skimming
along
in
silence
for
a
time
till
they
were
free
of
the
shores
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
shone
brilliantly
a
fitful
west
wind
scarcely
ruffled
the
water
along
the
shores
the
dock
lanterns
twinkled
and
above
and
beyond
them
the
lamps
of
the
cottages
flashed
and
vanished
dan
paddled
steadily
with
a
skilled
splashless
stroke
the
paddle
sank
noiselessly
and
rose
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
tinkling
drip
as
the
canoe
parted
the
waters
there
is
nothing
like
a
canoe
flight
under
stars
to
tranquilize
a
troubled
and
perplexed
spirit
and
dan
was
soon
won
to
the
mood
he
sought
it
seemed
to
him
that
sylvia
enfolded
in
the
dusk
in
the
bow
was
a
part
of
the
peace
of
sky
and
water
they
were
alone
away
from
the
strifes
and
jars
of
the
world
shut
in
together
as
completely
as
though
they
had
been
flung
back
for
unreckoned
ages
into
a
world
of
unbroken
calm
the
peace
that
wordsworth
sought
and
sang
crept
into
their
blood
and
each
was
sensible
that
the
other
knew
and
felt
it
and
that
it
was
grateful
to
them
both
sylvia
spoke
after
a
time
of
immaterial
things
or
answered
his
questions
as
to
the
identity
of
the
constellations
mapped
in
the
clear
arch
above
i
dream
sometimes
of
another
existence
she
said
as
i
suppose
every
one
does
when
i
knew
a
quiet
lake
that
held
the
stars
as
this
does
i
even
think
i
remember
how
it
looked
in
winter
with
the
ice
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
and
of
snow
coming
and
the
keen
winds
piling
it
in
drifts
it
odd
is
it
those
memories
we
have
that
are
not
memories
the
metempsychosis
idea
must
have
some
substance
we
have
all
been
somebody
else
sometime
and
we
clutch
at
the
shadows
of
our
old
selves
hardly
believing
they
are
shadows
it
a
good
deal
a
matter
of
imagination
is
it
asked
dan
idling
with
the
paddle
oh
but
i
have
a
bit
of
that
that
one
thing
i
not
troubled
with
and
i
sorry
for
it
when
i
look
up
at
the
stars
i
think
of
the
most
hideous
formula
for
calculating
their
distances
from
the
earth
when
i
read
in
a
novel
that
it
was
a
night
of
stars
i
immediately
wonder
what
particular
stars
it
used
to
make
dear
grandfather
kelton
furiously
indignant
to
find
a
moon
appearing
in
novels
contrary
to
the
almanac
he
used
to
check
up
all
the
moons
and
he
once
thought
of
writing
a
thesis
on
the
lunar
calculations
of
recent
novelists
but
decided
that
it
did
really
make
any
difference
and
of
course
it
does
as
they
discussed
novels
new
and
old
he
drew
in
his
paddle
and
crept
nearer
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
influences
of
earth
and
heaven
had
combined
to
create
this
hour
for
him
to
be
talking
to
her
of
books
that
interpreted
life
and
of
life
itself
was
in
itself
something
sweet
he
wished
such
comradeship
as
this
made
possible
by
their
common
interests
in
the
deep
surging
currents
of
the
century
in
which
they
lived
to
go
on
forever
their
discussion
of
tolstoy
was
interrupted
by
the
swift
flight
of
a
motor
boat
that
passed
near
raising
a
small
sea
and
he
seized
the
paddle
to
steady
the
canoe
then
silence
fell
upon
them
sylvia
he
said
softly
and
again
sylvia
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
silence
and
the
beauty
of
the
night
were
his
ally
communicating
to
her
infinite
longings
hidden
in
his
heart
which
he
had
no
words
to
express
i
love
you
sylvia
i
love
you
i
came
up
to
tell
you
that
oh
dan
you
must
say
it
you
must
never
say
it
the
canoe
seemed
to
hang
between
water
and
stars
a
motionless
argosy
in
a
sea
of
dreams
i
wanted
to
tell
you
before
you
came
away
he
went
on
not
heeding
i
have
wanted
to
tell
you
for
a
long
time
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
want
you
to
help
me
find
the
good
things
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
stand
for
them
you
came
just
when
i
needed
you
you
have
already
changed
me
made
a
different
man
of
me
it
was
through
you
that
i
escaped
from
my
old
self
that
was
weak
and
yielding
and
i
shall
do
better
yes
i
shall
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
so
weak
but
that
i
can
strive
and
achieve
every
word
you
ever
spoke
to
me
is
written
on
my
heart
i
need
you
sylvia
you
wrong
you
terribly
wrong
about
all
that
and
it
is
fair
to
let
you
say
such
things
please
dan
i
hoped
this
would
never
come
that
we
should
go
on
as
we
have
been
good
friends
talking
as
we
were
a
while
ago
of
the
fine
things
the
great
things
and
it
will
have
to
be
that
way
there
can
be
nothing
else
but
i
will
do
my
best
sylvia
i
not
the
man
you
knew
first
you
helped
me
to
see
the
light
without
you
i
shall
fall
into
the
dark
again
i
had
to
tell
you
sylvia
it
was
inevitable
that
i
should
tell
you
i
wonder
i
kept
it
to
myself
so
long
without
you
i
should
go
adrift
no
bearings
no
light
anywhere
you
found
yourself
dan
that
was
the
way
of
it
i
saw
it
and
appreciated
it
it
meant
more
to
me
than
i
can
tell
you
i
knew
exactly
how
it
was
that
you
started
as
you
did
it
was
part
of
your
fate
but
it
made
possible
the
finer
thing
it
nothing
in
you
or
what
you
done
or
may
do
but
i
have
my
own
work
to
do
i
have
cut
a
pattern
for
my
own
life
and
i
must
try
to
follow
it
i
think
you
understand
about
that
i
told
you
that
night
when
we
talked
of
our
aims
and
hopes
on
the
campus
at
montgomery
that
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
the
world
and
i
must
still
go
on
trying
to
do
that
it
a
poor
tiny
little
gleam
but
i
must
follow
the
gleam
but
there
nothing
in
that
that
we
ca
do
together
we
can
go
on
seeking
it
together
he
pleaded
i
hope
it
may
be
so
we
must
go
on
being
the
good
friends
we
are
now
you
and
aunt
sally
are
all
i
have
the
best
i
have
i
ca
let
you
spoil
that
she
ended
firmly
as
though
after
all
this
were
the
one
important
thing
there
was
nothing
here
he
reasoned
that
might
not
be
overcome
the
work
that
she
had
planned
to
do
imposed
no
barrier
men
and
women
were
finding
out
the
joy
of
striving
together
she
need
give
up
nothing
in
joining
her
life
to
his
he
touched
the
hand
that
lay
near
and
thrilled
to
the
contact
of
her
lingers
please
dan
she
pleaded
drawing
her
hand
away
i
mean
to
go
on
with
my
life
as
i
have
begun
it
i
shall
never
marry
dan
marriage
is
in
my
plan
at
all
but
for
you
the
right
woman
will
come
some
day
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
we
must
understand
all
this
now
and
i
must
be
sure
oh
very
sure
that
you
know
how
dear
it
is
to
have
had
you
say
these
things
to
me
but
i
shall
say
them
again
and
always
sylvia
this
was
only
the
beginning
i
had
to
speak
i
came
here
to
say
these
things
to
you
i
am
able
to
care
for
you
now
not
as
i
should
like
to
but
going
to
succeed
i
want
to
ease
the
way
for
you
i
mean
that
you
must
go
back
to
teaching
this
fall
there
you
see
and
he
knew
she
smiled
in
her
patient
sweet
way
that
was
dear
to
him
you
want
to
stop
my
work
before
it
begun
you
see
how
impossible
it
would
be
dan
but
you
can
do
other
things
there
are
infinite
ways
in
which
you
can
be
of
use
doing
the
things
you
want
to
do
the
school
work
is
only
a
handicap
drudgery
that
leads
to
nothing
he
knew
instantly
that
he
had
erred
and
that
he
must
give
her
no
opportunity
to
defend
her
attitude
toward
her
work
he
returned
quickly
to
his
great
longing
and
need
without
you
i
a
failure
sylvia
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
never
have
freed
myself
of
that
man
over
there
and
he
lifted
his
arm
toward
the
lights
of
the
bassett
landing
on
the
nearer
shore
no
you
would
have
saved
yourself
in
any
case
there
no
questioning
that
you
were
bound
to
do
it
and
it
was
the
man
it
was
the
base
servitude
that
you
came
to
despise
not
without
you
it
was
your
attitude
toward
me
after
that
cheap
piece
of
melodrama
i
figured
in
in
that
convention
that
brought
me
up
with
a
short
turn
it
all
came
through
you
my
wish
to
measure
up
to
your
ideal
that
absurd
dan
if
i
believed
that
i
should
think
much
less
of
you
i
really
should
she
exclaimed
it
was
something
finer
and
higher
than
that
it
was
your
own
manhood
asserting
itself
that
man
over
there
she
went
on
more
quietly
is
an
object
of
pity
he
beset
on
many
sides
it
hurt
him
to
lose
you
he
far
from
happy
he
has
no
claim
upon
happiness
he
does
deserve
happiness
replied
dan
doggedly
but
the
break
must
have
cost
you
something
have
you
missed
him
just
a
little
bit
it
was
clear
from
her
tone
that
she
wished
affirmation
of
this
the
reference
to
his
former
employer
angered
him
he
had
been
rejoicing
in
his
escape
from
morton
bassett
and
yet
sylvia
spoke
of
him
with
tolerance
and
sympathy
the
bassetts
were
coolly
using
her
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
embarrassments
resulting
from
their
own
folly
it
was
preposterous
that
they
should
have
sent
sylvia
to
bring
marian
home
and
his
rage
was
intensified
by
the
recollection
of
the
pathos
he
had
himself
felt
in
bassett
that
very
evening
as
he
had
watched
him
mount
the
steps
of
his
home
sylvia
was
causing
the
old
chords
to
vibrate
with
full
knowledge
that
in
spite
of
his
avowed
contempt
for
the
man
morton
bassett
still
roused
his
curiosity
and
interest
it
was
unfair
for
sylvia
to
take
advantage
of
this
bassett
nothing
to
me
he
said
roughly
he
seems
to
me
the
loneliest
soul
i
ever
knew
replied
sylvia
quietly
he
deserves
it
he
brought
himself
to
that
i
do
believe
he
altogether
evil
there
must
be
good
in
him
it
because
he
so
evil
that
you
pity
him
it
because
of
that
that
i
sorry
for
him
it
because
we
know
that
he
must
be
broken
upon
the
wheel
before
he
realizes
the
vile
use
he
has
made
of
his
power
that
we
are
sorry
for
him
why
sylvia
he
the
worst
foe
we
have
all
of
us
who
want
to
do
what
we
call
the
great
things
ease
the
burdens
of
the
poor
make
government
honest
catch
the
gleam
we
seek
even
poor
allen
when
he
stands
on
the
monument
steps
at
midnight
and
spouts
to
me
about
the
great
experiment
feels
what
morton
bassett
ca
be
made
to
feel
but
he
may
yet
see
it
even
he
may
come
to
see
it
murmured
sylvia
he
a
hard
stubborn
brute
it
in
the
lines
of
his
back
i
was
studying
him
on
the
boat
this
evening
and
my
eyes
followed
him
up
the
steps
after
they
dropped
him
at
his
dock
it
in
those
strong
iron
hands
of
his
i
tell
you
what
we
feel
for
him
is
only
the
kind
of
pity
we
have
for
those
we
know
to
be
doomed
by
the
gods
to
an
ignominious
end
he
not
worth
our
pity
he
asks
no
mercy
and
he
wo
get
any
he
was
at
once
ashamed
of
the
temper
to
which
he
had
yielded
and
angry
at
himself
for
having
broken
the
calm
of
the
night
with
these
discordant
notes
sylvia
hand
touched
the
water
caressingly
waking
tiny
ripples
sylvia
he
said
when
he
was
calm
again
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
have
told
you
dan
that
i
can
never
marry
any
one
and
that
must
be
the
end
of
it
but
your
work
can
go
on
he
began
ready
for
another
assault
upon
that
barrier
a
sailboat
loitering
in
the
light
wind
had
stolen
close
upon
them
and
passed
hardly
a
paddle
length
away
dan
without
changing
his
position
drove
the
canoe
toward
the
shore
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddle
then
steadied
himself
to
speak
again
sylvia
eyes
watched
the
sails
vanishing
like
ghosts
into
the
dark
that
wo
do
sylvia
that
is
enough
you
have
said
that
you
do
care
for
me
you
have
said
that
you
do
love
me
and
i
believe
that
your
ambitions
alone
are
in
the
way
believe
me
that
i
respect
them
i
should
never
interfere
with
them
there
must
be
some
other
reason
i
ca
take
no
for
an
answer
this
night
was
made
for
us
no
other
night
will
ever
be
just
like
this
please
dear
if
there
are
other
reasons
than
my
own
poor
spirit
and
the
little
i
can
offer
let
me
know
it
if
you
do
care
it
will
be
kinder
to
say
it
now
if
that
is
the
reason
even
if
there
some
other
man
let
me
know
it
now
tell
me
what
it
is
sylvia
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
said
she
did
not
care
her
silence
now
at
the
direct
question
stirred
new
fears
to
life
in
his
breast
like
the
beat
of
startled
wings
from
a
thicket
in
november
only
the
lights
of
the
sailboat
were
visible
now
but
suddenly
a
voice
rose
clear
and
sweet
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
guitar
and
mandolin
the
guitar
throbbed
and
on
its
deep
chords
the
mandolin
wove
its
melody
the
voice
seemed
to
steal
out
of
the
heart
of
the
night
and
float
over
the
still
waters
the
unseen
singer
never
knew
the
mockery
of
the
song
she
sang
it
was
an
old
song
and
the
air
was
one
familiar
the
world
round
and
it
bore
the
answer
to
dan
question
which
sylvia
had
carried
long
in
her
heart
but
could
not
speak
she
did
not
speak
it
then
it
was
ordained
that
she
should
never
speak
it
and
dan
knew
and
understood
who
is
sylvia
what
is
she
that
all
the
swains
adore
her
is
dan
knew
in
that
hour
the
answer
of
tears
the
song
ceased
when
dan
saw
sylvia
head
lift
he
silently
took
the
paddle
and
impelled
the
canoe
toward
the
red
white
and
blue
lanterns
that
defined
owen
landing
they
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
intervening
green
light
of
the
bassett
dock
when
a
brilliant
meteor
darted
across
the
zenith
and
dan
exclamation
broke
the
tension
their
eyes
turned
toward
the
heavens
sylvia
still
bright
with
tears
dan
knew
though
he
could
not
see
her
face
poor
lost
star
she
murmured
softly
dan
was
turning
the
canoe
slightly
to
avoid
the
jutting
shore
that
made
a
miniature
harbor
at
the
bassett
when
sylvia
uttered
a
low
warning
dan
instantly
alert
gripped
his
paddle
and
waited
some
one
had
launched
a
canoe
at
the
bassett
boathouse
there
was
a
stealthiness
in
the
performance
that
roused
him
to
vigilance
he
cautiously
backed
water
and
waited
a
word
or
two
spoken
in
a
low
tone
reached
dan
and
sylvia
two
persons
seemed
to
be
embarking
a
canoe
shot
out
suddenly
from
the
dock
driven
by
a
confident
hand
it
must
be
marian
but
there
some
one
with
her
said
sylvia
dan
had
already
settled
himself
in
the
stern
ready
for
a
race
it
probably
that
idiot
allen
he
growled
we
must
follow
them
away
from
the
shore
shadows
the
starlight
was
sufficient
to
confirm
dan
surmise
as
to
the
nature
of
this
canoe
flight
it
was
quite
ten
and
the
lights
in
the
bassett
house
on
the
bluff
above
had
been
extinguished
it
was
at
once
clear
to
dan
that
he
must
act
promptly
allen
dismayed
by
the
complications
that
beset
his
had
proposed
an
elopement
and
marian
had
lent
a
willing
ear
they
running
away
sylvia
we
got
to
head
them
off
he
bent
to
his
paddle
vigorously
they
ca
possibly
get
away
but
it
was
not
in
marian
blood
to
be
thwarted
in
her
pursuit
of
adventure
she
was
of
the
canoeist
difficult
art
and
her
canoe
flew
on
as
though
drawn
away
into
the
dark
on
unseen
cords
you
better
lend
a
hand
said
dan
and
sylvia
turned
round
and
knelt
paddling
indian
fashion
the
canoe
skimmed
the
water
swiftly
it
was
in
their
thoughts
that
marian
and
allen
must
not
land
at
waupegan
where
their
intentions
would
be
advertised
to
the
world
the
race
must
end
before
the
dock
was
reached
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dan
called
to
sylvia
to
cease
paddling
we
passed
them
there
no
doubt
of
that
he
said
peering
into
the
dark
maybe
they
just
out
for
fun
and
have
turned
back
suggested
sylvia
i
wish
i
could
think
so
more
likely
they
trying
to
throw
us
off
let
check
up
for
a
moment
and
see
if
we
hear
them
again
he
kept
the
canoe
moving
slowly
while
they
listened
for
some
sign
of
the
lost
quarry
then
suddenly
they
heard
a
paddle
stroke
behind
them
and
an
instant
later
a
canoe
bow
brushed
their
craft
as
lightly
as
a
hand
passing
across
paper
dan
threw
himself
forward
and
grasped
the
sides
firmly
there
was
a
splashing
and
wobbling
as
he
arrested
the
flight
a
canoe
is
at
once
the
most
docile
and
the
most
intractable
of
argosies
sylvia
churned
the
water
with
her
paddle
seeking
to
crowd
the
rocking
canoes
closer
together
while
marian
endeavored
to
drive
them
apart
allen
panted
dan
prone
on
the
bottom
of
his
canoe
and
gripping
the
thwarts
of
the
rebellious
craft
beside
him
this
must
end
here
let
us
go
cried
allen
stridently
this
is
none
of
your
business
let
us
go
i
say
finding
it
impossible
to
free
her
canoe
marian
threw
down
her
paddle
angrily
they
were
all
breathless
dan
waited
till
the
canoes
rode
together
quietly
sylvia
had
brought
an
electric
lamp
which
dan
now
flashed
the
length
of
the
captive
canoe
it
searched
the
anxious
angry
faces
of
the
runaways
and
disclosed
two
suit
cases
that
told
their
own
story
i
told
you
to
keep
away
from
here
allen
you
ca
do
this
it
do
said
dan
snapping
off
the
light
you
going
home
with
us
marian
i
wo
go
back
you
have
any
right
to
stop
me
you
have
any
right
to
run
away
in
this
fashion
said
sylvia
speaking
for
the
first
time
you
would
cause
endless
trouble
it
not
the
way
to
do
it
but
it
the
only
way
out
stormed
allen
there
no
other
way
dan
told
me
himself
i
could
speak
to
bassett
and
this
is
the
only
thing
we
could
do
will
you
kindly
tell
me
just
what
you
intended
doing
asked
dan
still
gripping
the
canoe
i
spoken
to
the
minister
here
in
the
village
marian
was
going
to
spend
the
night
at
his
house
and
we
were
to
be
married
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
i
could
get
a
license
you
ca
get
a
marriage
license
in
waupegan
your
minister
ought
to
know
that
no
but
we
could
have
driven
over
early
to
the
county
seat
and
got
it
i
tell
you
i
had
it
all
fixed
you
let
go
of
that
canoe
stand
by
sylvia
said
dan
with
determination
he
steadied
himself
a
moment

chapter
xxx
the
king
hath
summoned
his
parliament
the
great
seal
of
the
hoosier
commonwealth
depicting
a
sturdy
pioneer
felling
a
tree
while
behind
him
a
frightened
buffalo
gallops
madly
into
oblivion
was
affixed
to
a
proclamation
of
the
governor
convening
the
legislature
in
special
session
on
the
of
november
it
was
morton
bassett
legislature
declared
the
republican
press
brought
back
to
the
capital
to
do
those
things
which
it
had
left
undone
at
the
regular
session
the
democratic
newspapers
proved
conclusively
that
the
demands
of
the
state
institutions
said
to
be
in
dire
need
were
the
fruit
of
a
long
period
of
republican
extravagance
for
which
the
democratic
party
always
prone
to
err
on
the
side
of
frugality
was
in
no
wise
responsible
the
republican
governor
had
caused
the
legislative
halls
to
be
reopened
merely
to
give
a
false
impression
of
democratic
incompetence
but
in
due
season
the
people
would
express
their
opinion
of
that
governor
so
reasoned
loyal
democrats
legislatures
are
not
cheap
taken
at
their
lowest
valuation
and
a
special
session
costing
something
like
one
hundred
thousand
of
the
people
dollars
is
an
extravagance
before
which
a
governor
may
well
hesitate
this
particular
convocation
of
the
hoosier
lawmakers
summoned
easily
enough
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
proved
to
be
expensive
in
more
ways
than
one
on
the
third
day
of
the
special
session
when
the
tardiest
member
hailing
from
the
remote
fastnesses
of
switzerland
county
was
just
finding
his
seat
and
before
all
the
others
had
drawn
their
stationery
and
registered
a
generous
computation
of
their
mileage
something
happened
the
bill
for
an
act
entitled
an
act
to
lift
the
lid
of
the
treasure
chests
was
about
to
be
read
for
the
first
time
when
a
page
carried
a
telegram
to
morton
bassett
in
the
senate
chamber
senator
bassett
read
his
message
once
and
again
his
neighbors
on
the
floor
looked
enviously
upon
the
great
man
who
thus
received
telegrams
without
emotion
it
seemed
however
to
those
nearest
him
that
the
bit
of
yellow
paper
shook
slightly
in
bassett
hand
the
clerk
droned
on
to
an
inattentive
audience
bassett
put
down
the
telegram
looked
about
and
then
got
upon
his
feet
the
yawning
and
idly
playing
with
his
gavel
saw
with
relief
that
the
senator
from
fraser
wished
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
mr
president
the
senator
from
fraser
president
i
ask
leave
to
interrupt
the
reading
of
the
bill
to
make
an
announcement
there
being
no
objection
the
senator
will
make
his
announcement
senators
who
had
been
smoking
in
the
cloakroom
or
talking
to
friends
outside
the
railing
became
attentive
the
senator
from
fraser
was
little
given
to
speech
and
it
might
be
that
he
meant
at
this
time
to
indicate
the
attitude
of
the
majority
toward
the
appropriations
asked
by
the
governor
in
any
event
it
was
always
wise
to
listen
to
anything
morton
bassett
had
to
say
the
senator
was
unusually
deliberate
even
when
he
had
secured
the
undivided
attention
of
the
chamber
he
picked
up
the
telegram
and
read
it
through
again
as
though
to
familiarize
himself
with
its
contents
president
i
have
just
received
the
following
message
from
a
personal
friend
in
washington
honorable
roger
ridgefield
united
states
senator
from
indiana
while
on
a
hunting
trip
in
chesapeake
bay
with
a
party
of
baltimore
friends
died
suddenly
this
morning
the
death
occurred
at
a
point
remote
from
the
telegraph
no
particulars
have
yet
been
received
at
washington
it
is
with
profound
sorrow
president
that
i
make
this
announcement
though
senator
ridgefield
had
long
been
my
political
antagonist
he
had
also
been
for
many
years
a
valued
personal
friend
the
republican
party
has
lost
one
of
its
great
leaders
and
the
state
of
indiana
a
son
to
whom
men
of
all
parties
have
given
their
ungrudging
admiration
president
i
move
that
the
senate
do
now
adjourn
to
meet
at
ten
morning
even
before
the
motion
could
be
put
bassett
was
passing
about
among
the
desks
the
men
he
spoke
to
nodded
understandingly
a
mild
subdued
excitement
reigned
in
the
chamber
it
flashed
through
the
mind
of
every
democratic
member
that
that
death
in
the
chesapeake
had
brought
a
crisis
in
the
war
between
bassett
and
thatcher
in
due
course
the
assembly
convened
in
joint
session
would
mourn
decorously
the
death
of
a
statesman
who
had
long
and
honorably
represented
the
old
hoosier
state
in
the
greatest
tribunal
on
earth
and
his
passing
would
be
feelingly
referred
to
in
sonorous
phrases
as
an
untoward
event
a
deplorable
and
irreparable
loss
to
the
commonwealth
to
republicans
however
it
was
a
piece
of
stupendous
that
the
senator
should
have
indulged
in
the
childish
pastime
of
duck
shooting
at
an
inconvenient
season
when
the
democratic
majority
in
the
general
assembly
would
be
able
to
elect
a
successor
to
complete
his
term
of
office
when
the
gavel
fell
adjourning
the
senate
gentlemen
were
already
seeking
in
the
federal
constitution
for
the
exact
language
of
the
section
bearing
upon
this
emergency
if
the
republican
governor
had
not
so
gayly
summoned
the
legislature
he
might
have
appointed
a
senator
of
his
own
political
faith
to
serve
until
the
next
regular
session
following
the
elections
a
year
hence
it
was
ungenerous
and
disloyal
of
roger
ridgefield
to
have
taken
himself
out
of
the
world
in
this
abrupt
fashion
before
the
first
shock
had
passed
there
were
those
about
the
state
house
who
scanning
the
newspaper
extras
were
saying
that
a
secret
fondness
for
poker
and
not
an
enthusiasm
for
ducks
had
led
the
honorable
roger
ridgefield
to
the
remote
arm
of
the
chesapeake
where
he
had
been
the
guest
of
a
financier
whose
influence
in
the
upper
house
of
congress
was
notoriously
pernicious
this
did
not
however
alter
the
immediate
situation
the
language
of
the
federal
and
state
constitutions
was
all
too
explicit
for
the
republican
minority
it
was
only
in
recess
that
a
governor
might
fill
a
vacancy
and
beyond
doubt
the
general
assembly
was
in
town
lawfully
brought
from
the
farm
the
desk
the
mine
and
the
factory
as
though
expressly
to
satisfy
the
greed
for
power
of
a
voracious
democracy
groups
of
members
were
retiring
to
quiet
corners
to
discuss
the
crisis
bassett
had
already
designated
a
committee
room
where
he
would
meet
his
followers
and
stanch
adherents
thatcher
men
had
gone
forth
to
seek
their
chief
the
democrats
would
gain
a
certain
moral
strength
through
the
possession
of
a
senator
in
congress
the
man
chosen
to
fill
the
vacancy
would
have
an
almost
irresistible
claim
upon
the
senatorship
if
the
democrats
should
control
the
next
legislature
it
was
worth
fighting
for
that
dead
man
seat
the
full
significance
of
the
news
was
not
wasted
upon
representative
harwood
the
house
adjourned
promptly
and
dan
hastened
to
write
telegrams
he
wired
colonel
ramsay
of
aurora
to
come
to
the
capital
on
the
first
train
telegrams
went
flying
that
afternoon
to
every
part
of
indiana
thatcher
read
the
evening
papers
in
chicago
and
kept
the
wires
hot
while
he
waited
for
the
first
train
for
indianapolis
one
of
his
messages
addressed
to
harwood
read
breakfast
with
me
morning
at
my
house
strictly
private
this
is
your
big
chance
harwood
locked
in
his
office
in
the
law
building
received
this
message
by
telephone
and
it
aroused
his
ire
his
relations
with
thatcher
did
not
justify
that
gentleman
in
tendering
him
a
strictly
private
breakfast
nor
did
he
relish
having
a
big
chance
pointed
out
to
him
by
thatcher
it
can
not
be
denied
that
dan
too
felt
that
senator
ridgefield
had
chosen
a
most
unfortunate
season
for
exposing
himself
to
the
ravages
of
the
pneumococcus
he
kept
away
from
the
state
house
and
hotels
that
evening
having
decided
to
take
no
part
in
the
preliminary
skirmishes
until
he
had
seen
ramsay
who
would
bring
a
cool
head
and
a
trained
hand
to
bear
upon
this
unforeseen
situation
he
studied
the
newspapers
as
he
ate
breakfast
alone
at
the
university
club
early
the
next
morning
the
advertiser
had
neatly
divided
its
first
page
between
the
honorable
roger
ridgefield
dead
in
a
far
country
and
the
honorable
morton
bassett
who
it
seemed
was
very
much
alive
at
the
hoosier
capital
a
double
column
headline
conveyed
this
intelligence
bassett
is
himself
again
harwood
nibbled
his
toast
and
winnowed
the
chaff
of
speculation
from
the
grains
of
truth
in
this
article
he
had
checked
off
the
names
of
all
the
bassett
men
in
both
houses
of
the
assembly
and
listed
supporters
and
the
doubtful
members
bassett
would
undoubtedly
make
a
strong
showing
in
a
caucus
but
whether
he
would
be
able
to
command
a
majority
remained
to
be
seen
there
were
men
among
the
doubtful
who
would
be
disposed
to
favor
thatcher
because
he
had
driven
a
wedge
into
the
old
bassett
stone
wall
no
one
else
had
ever
succeeded
in
imperiling
the
security
of
that
impregnable
stronghold
the
thought
of
this
made
harwood
uncomfortable
it
was
unfortunate
from
every
standpoint
that
the
legislature
should
be
called
upon
to
choose
a
senator
without
the
usual
time
for
preparation
dan
had
already
been
struck
by
the
general
air
of
irresponsibility
that
prevailed
among
the
legislators
many
of
the
members
had
looked
upon
the
special
session
as
a
lark
they
seemed
to
feel
that
their
accountability
to
their
constituents
had
ended
with
the
regular
session
the
courier
dan
observed
printed
an
excellent
biographical
sketch
of
the
dead
senator
and
its
news
article
on
the
democratic
opportunity
was
seemly
and
colorless
the
state
and
federal
statutes
bearing
upon
the
emergency
were
quoted
in
full
but
the
names
of
bassett
and
thatcher
did
not
appear
nor
were
any
possible
successors
to
ridgefield
mentioned
dan
opened
to
the
editorial
page
and
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
leading
article
a
dignified
eulogy
of
the
dead
senator
then
his
eye
fastened
upon
an
article
so
placed
that
it
dominated
the
whole
page
it
was
the
old
stop
look
listen
editorial
reproduced
with
minute
citation
of
the
date
of
original
publication
dan
flinched
as
though
a
cupful
of
ice
water
had
struck
him
in
the
face
whatever
scandalous
knowledge
touching
bassett
public
or
private
life
thatcher
might
possess
it
was
plain
that
bassett
was
either
ignorant
of
it
or
knew
and
did
not
fear
exposure
in
either
event
the
republication
of
the
stop
look
listen
article
was
an
invitation
to
battle
it
was
in
no
happy
frame
of
mind
that
harwood
awaited
the
coming
of
ramsay

sylvia
asks
questions
the
wares
had
asked
sylvia
to
dine
with
them
on
friday
evening
a
fortnight
later
and
harwood
was
to
call
for
her
at
the
minister
at
nine
sylvia
went
directly
to
the
wares
from
school
and
on
reaching
the
house
learned
that
ware
had
not
come
home
and
that
the
minister
was
engaged
with
a
caller
in
the
parlor
sylvia
who
knew
the
ways
of
the
house
well
left
her
wraps
in
the
hall
and
made
herself
comfortable
in
the
study
that
curious
little
room
that
was
never
free
from
the
odor
of
pipe
smoke
and
where
an
old
cavalry
sabre
hung
above
the
desk
upon
which
in
old
times
many
sermons
had
been
written
a
saddle
a
and
a
dwelt
together
harmoniously
in
one
corner
and
over
the
back
of
a
chair
hung
a
dilapidated
corduroy
coat
it
had
been
whispered
in
orthodox
circles
that
ware
had
amused
himself
one
winter
after
his
retirement
by
profanely
feeding
his
theological
library
into
the
furnace
however
true
this
may
be
few
authors
were
represented
in
his
library
and
these
were
as
far
as
possible
compressed
in
one
volume
shakespeare
milton
emerson
arnold
and
whittier
were
always
ready
to
his
hand
and
he
kept
a
supply
of
slender
volumes
of
sill
poems
in
a
cupboard
in
the
hall
and
handed
them
out
discriminatingly
to
his
callers
the
house
was
the
resort
of
many
young
people
some
of
them
children
of
ware
former
parishioners
and
he
was
much
given
to
discussing
books
with
them
or
he
would
read
aloud
sohrab
and
rustum
lowell
essay
on
lincoln
or
favorite
chapters
from
old
curiosity
shop
or
again
it
might
be
a
review
article
on
the
social
trend
or
a
fresh
view
of
an
old
economic
topic
the
wares
was
the
pleasantest
of
small
houses
and
after
owen
the
place
sought
oftenest
by
sylvia
there
a
gentleman
with
ware
he
been
here
a
long
time
said
the
maid
lingering
to
lay
a
fresh
stick
of
wood
on
the
grate
fire
sylvia
warming
her
hands
at
the
blaze
heard
the
faint
blur
of
voices
from
the
parlor
she
surveyed
the
room
with
the
indifference
of
familiarity
glanced
at
a
new
magazine
and
then
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
picked
up
a
book
she
had
never
noticed
before
she
was
surprised
to
find
it
a
copy
of
society
and
solitude
that
did
not
match
the
set
of
emerson
one
of
the
few
sets
ware
owned
she
passed
her
hand
over
the
green
covers
that
were
well
worn
and
scratched
in
places
the
fact
that
the
minister
boasted
in
his
humorous
way
of
never
wasting
money
on
bindings
caused
sylvia
to
examine
this
volume
with
an
attention
she
would
not
have
given
it
in
any
other
house
on
the
fly
leaf
was
written
in
pencil
in
ware
rough
uneven
hand
an
inscription
which
covered
the
page
with
the
last
words
cramped
in
the
lower
corner
these
were
almost
illegible
but
sylvia
felt
her
way
through
them
slowly
and
then
turned
to
the
middle
of
the
book
quickly
with
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
having
read
a
private
memorandum
of
the
minister
the
margins
of
his
books
she
knew
were
frequently
scribbled
over
with
notes
that
meant
nothing
whatever
to
any
one
but
ware
himself
after
a
moment
her
eyes
sought
again
irresistibly
the
inscription
she
it
slowly
the
way
of
peace
they
know
not
and
there
is
no
judgment
in
their
goings
they
have
made
them
crooked
paths

goeth

not
know
peace
tramping
in
adirondacks
baptized
elizabeth
at
harris
it
was
almost
like
eavesdropping
to
come
in
this
way
upon
that
curiously
abrupt
statement
of
the
minister
tramping
in
adirondacks
baptized
elizabeth
at
harris
the
discussion
in
the
parlor
had
become
heated
and
occasionally
words
in
a
voice
not
ware
reached
sylvia
distinctly
some
one
was
alternately
beseeching
and
threatening
the
minister
it
was
clear
from
the
pauses
in
which
she
recognized
ware
deep
tones
that
he
was
yielding
neither
to
the
importunities
nor
the
threats
of
his
blustering
caller
sylvia
had
imagined
that
the
storms
of
life
had
passed
over
the
retired
clergyman
and
she
was
surprised
that
such
an
interview
should
be
taking
place
in
his
house
she
was
about
to
retreat
to
the
to
be
out
of
reach
of
the
voices
when
the
parlor
door
opened
abruptly
and
thatcher
appeared
with
anger
unmistakably
showing
in
his
face
and
apparently
disposed
to
resume
in
the
hall
the
discussion
which
the
minister
had
terminated
in
the
library
thatcher
seemed
balder
and
more
repellent
than
when
she
had
first
seen
him
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
hall
on
the
day
harwood
uttered
bassett
defiance
sylvia
rose
with
the
book
still
in
her
hand
and
walked
to
the
end
of
the
room
but
any
one
in
the
house
might
have
heard
what
thatcher
was
saying
that
the
way
with
you
preachers
you
talk
about
clean
politics
and
when
we
get
all
ready
to
clean
out
a
bad
man
you
duck
you
a
lot
of
cowardly
dodgers
i
tell
you
i
do
want
you
to
say
a
word
or
figure
in
this
thing
at
all
but
you
give
me
that
book
and
i
scare
mort
bassett
out
of
town
i
scare
him
clean
out
of
indiana
and
never
show
his
head
again
why
ware
i
been
counting
on
it
that
when
you
saw
we
were
in
a
hole
and
going
to
lose
you
come
down
from
your
high
horse
and
help
me
out
i
tell
you
there
no
doubt
about
it
that
woman
the
woman
i
looking
for
i
guessed
it
the
night
you
told
that
story
up
there
in
the
quit
this
business
ed
the
minister
was
saying
i
an
old
friend
of
yours
but
i
wo
budge
an
inch
i
never
breathed
a
word
of
that
story
before
and
i
should
have
told
it
that
night
it
was
so
far
back
that
i
thought
it
was
safe
but
your
idea
that
bassett
had
anything
to
do
with
that
is
preposterous
your
hatred
of
him
has
got
the
better
of
you
my
friend
drop
it
forget
it
if
you
ca
whip
him
fair
let
him
win
not
much
i
wo
but
i
did
think
you
go
back
on
me
i
thought
better
of
you
than
that
thatcher
strode
to
the
door
and
went
out
slamming
it
after
him
the
minister
peered
into
the
library
absently
and
then
surprised
to
find
sylvia
advanced
to
meet
her
smiling
gravely
he
took
both
her
hands
and
held
them
looking
into
her
face
what
this
you
been
reading
ah
that
book
the
volume
slipped
into
his
hands
and
he
glanced
at
it
frowning
impatiently
poor
little
book
i
ought
to
have
burned
it
years
ago
and
i
ought
to
have
learned
by
this
time
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
they
always
said
i
look
like
an
indian
but
an
indian
never
tells
anything
i
told
just
one
story
too
many
maxima
culpa
he
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
beside
his
desk
placed
the
book
within
reach
and
kept
touching
it
as
he
talked
i
saw
thatcher
said
sylvia
he
seemed
very
much
aroused
i
could
help
hearing
a
word
now
and
then
that
all
right
sylvia
i
known
thatcher
for
years
and
last
fall
i
went
up
to
his
on
the
kankakee
for
a
week
shooting
allen
and
dan
harwood
were
the
rest
of
the
party
and
i
happened
to
tell
the
story
of
this
little
book
an
unfinished
story
we
ought
never
to
tell
stories
until
they
are
finished
and
it
seems
that
thatcher
with
a
zeal
worthy
of
a
better
cause
has
been
raking
up
the
ashes
of
an
old
affair
of
bassett
with
a
woman
and
he
trying
to
hitch
it
on
to
the
story
i
told
him
about
this
book
he
says
by
shaking
this
at
bassett
he
can
persuade
him
that
he
got
enough
ammunition
to
blow
him
out
of
the
water
but
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
wo
believe
such
a
thing
of
morton
bassett
and
even
if
i
did
thatcher
ca
have
that
book
i
owe
it
to
the
woman
whose
baby
i
baptized
up
there
in
the
hills
to
keep
it
and
the
woman
may
be
living
too
for
all
i
know
i
think
of
her
pretty
often
she
was
game
would
tell
anything
if
a
man
had
deceived
her
she
stood
by
him
whatever
she
was
i
know
she
was
not
bad
not
a
bit
of
it
the
spirit
of
the
hills
had
entered
into
her
and
those
are
cleansing
airs
up
there
i
suppose
it
all
made
the
deeper
impression
on
me
because
i
was
born
up
there
myself
when
i
strike
adirondacks
in
print
i
put
down
my
book
and
think
a
while
it
a
picture
word
it
brings
back
my
earliest
childhood
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
call
words
that
make
pictures
that
way
moose
words
they
jump
up
in
your
memory
like
a
scared
moose
in
a
thicket
and
crash
into
the
woods
like
a
cavalry
charge
i
can
remember
things
that
happened
when
i
was
three
years
old
one
day
father
shot
a
deer
in
our
cornfield
and
i
recall
it
perfectly
the
general
atmosphere
of
the
old
place
steals
over
me
yet
the
very
thought
of
the
pointed
spruces
the
feathery
tamaracks
all
the
scents
and
sounds
of
summer
and
the
long
white
winters
does
my
soul
good
now
the
old
hebrews
understood
the
effect
of
landscape
on
character
they
knew
most
everything
those
old
chaps
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
any
strength
there
is
in
me
dates
back
to
the
hills
of
my
youth
i
like
to
go
back
there
to
die
when
the
bugle
calls
ware
had
not
yet
come
in
ware
lighted
the
lamp
and
freshened
the
fire
while
he
was
doing
this
sylvia
moved
to
a
chair
by
the
table
and
picked
up
the
book
what
ware
had
said
about
the
hills
of
his
youth
the
woods
the
word
tamarack
that
he
had
dropped
carelessly
touched
chords
of
memory
as
lightly
as
a
breeze
vibrates
a
wind
harp
was
this
merely
her
imagination
that
had
been
stirred
or
was
it
indeed
a
recollection
often
before
she
had
been
moved
by
similar
vague
memories
or
longings
whatever
they
were
they
had
come
to
trouble
her
girlhood
at
montgomery
when
the
snow
whitened
the
campus
and
the
wind
sang
in
the
trees
she
was
grateful
that
the
minister
had
turned
his
back
her
hands
trembled
as
she
glanced
again
at
the
scribbled
fly
leaf
and
more
closely
at
the
words
penciled
at
the
bottom
baptized
elizabeth
at
harris
thatcher
wanted
this
book
to
use
against
bassett
bassett
was
a
collector
of
fine
bindings
she
had
heard
it
spoken
of
in
the
family
it
was
part
of
marian
pride
in
her
father
that
he
was
a
bookish
man
when
the
minister
returned
to
his
seat
sylvia
asked
as
she
put
down
the
book
who
was
elizabeth
and
then
little
by
little
in
his
abrupt
way
he
told
the
story
much
as
he
had
told
it
that
night
on
the
kankakee
with
pauses
for
which
sylvia
was
grateful
they
gave
her
time
for
thought
for
filling
in
the
lapses
for
visualizing
the
scene
he
described
and
the
shadow
of
the
morton
bassett
she
knew
crept
into
the
picture
she
recalled
their
early
meetings
that
first
brief
contact
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
their
talk
on
the
day
following
the
convention
when
she
had
laughed
at
him
that
wet
evening
when
they
met
in
the
street
and
he
had
expressed
his
interest
in
harwood
and
the
hope
that
she
might
care
for
the
young
lawyer
with
her
trained
habits
of
reasoning
she
rejected
this
or
that
bit
of
testimony
as
worthless
but
even
then
enough
remained
to
chill
her
heart
her
hands
were
cold
as
she
clasped
them
together
who
was
elizabeth
ah
who
was
sylvia
the
phrase
of
the
song
that
had
brought
her
to
tears
that
starry
night
on
the
lake
when
dan
harwood
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
smote
her
again
her
grandfather
evasion
of
her
questions
about
her
father
and
mother
and
the
twinges
of
heartache
she
had
experienced
at
college
when
other
girls
spoke
of
their
homes
assumed
now
for
the
first
time
a
sinister
meaning
had
she
indeed
come
into
the
world
in
dishonor
and
had
she
in
truth
known
that
far
hill
country
with
its
evergreens
and
glistening
snows
ware
had
finished
his
story
and
sat
staring
into
the
crackling
fire
at
last
he
turned
toward
sylvia
in
the
glow
of
the
desk
lamp
her
face
was
white
and
she
gazed
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
inscription
in
the
book
the
silence
was
still
unbroken
when
a
few
minutes
later
ware
came
in
with
harwood
whom
she
had
met
in
the
street
and
brought
home
to
dinner
dan
was
full
of
the
situation
in
the
legislature
and
the
table
talk
played
about
that
topic
we
sparring
for
time
that
all
and
the
people
pay
the
freight
the
deadlock
is
clamped
on
tight
i
never
thought
thatcher
would
prove
so
strong
i
think
we
could
shake
loose
enough
votes
from
both
sides
to
precipitate
a
stampede
for
ramsay
but
he
wo
hear
to
it
he
says
he
wants
to
do
the
state
one
patriotic
service
before
he
dies
by
cleaning
out
the
bosses
and
he
does
want
to
spoil
the
record
by
taking
the
senatorship
himself
meanwhile
bassett
stands
fast
and
there
no
telling
when
he
break
through
thatcher
lines
thatcher
was
here
to
see
me
the
third
time
he
wo
come
back
you
know
what
he
after
said
ware
yes
i
understand
dan
answered
there
wo
be
anything
of
that
kind
will
there
dan
dan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
glanced
at
sylvia
and
ware
ware
knows
about
it
i
had
to
tell
her
remarked
the
minister
chuckling
when
ed
thatcher
makes
two
calls
on
me
in
one
week
and
one
of
them
at
midnight
there
got
to
be
an
explanation
and
sylvia
heard
him
raving
before
i
showed
him
out
this
afternoon
sylvia
plate
was
untouched
her
eyes
searched
those
of
the
man
who
loved
her
before
she
spoke
that
an
ethical
point
ware
if
it
were
necessary
to
use
that
if
every
other
resource
failed
would
you
use
it
no
not
if
bassett
success
meant
the
utter
destruction
of
the
state
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
have
the
slightest
confidence
in
thatcher
detective
work
and
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
has
to
grasp
something
firmer
than
my
pitiful
little
book
to
convince
me
dan
shook
his
head
he
does
need
the
book
ware
i
seen
the
documents
in
the
case
most
of
the
evidence
is
circumstantial
but
you
remember
what
your
friend
thoreau
said
about
circumstantial
evidence
something
to
the
effect
that
it
sometimes
pretty
convincing
as
when
you
find
a
trout
in
the
milk
but
has
thatcher
found
the
trout
well
no
he
has
exactly
found
the
trout
but
there
enough
there
altogether
too
much
ended
dan
despairingly
the
caucus
does
meet
again
till
night
when
thatcher
promises
to
show
his
hand
i
going
to
put
in
the
time
trying
to
persuade
ramsay
to
come
round
you
might
take
it
yourself
dan
suggested
ware
oh
i
not
eligible
i
a
little
shy
of
being
old
enough
and
besides
i
could
allow
ramsay
to
prove
himself
a
better
patriot
than
i
am
there
are
plenty
of
fellows
who
have
no
such
scruples
and
got
to
look
out
or
bassett
will
shift
suddenly
to
some
man
of
his
own
if
he
finds
he
ca
nominate
himself
but
do
you
think
he
has
any
idea
what
thatcher
has
up
his
sleeve
asked
ware
it
possible
i
dare
say
he
knows
it
he
always
been
master
of
the
art
of
getting
information
from
the
enemy
camp
but
thatcher
has
shown
remarkable
discretion
in
managing
this
he
tells
me
solemnly
that
nobody
on
earth
knows
his
intentions
except
you
allen
and
me
he
saving
himself
for
a
broadside
and
he
wants
its
full
dramatic
effect
sylvia
had
hardly
spoken
during
this
discussion
but
the
others
looked
at
her
curiously
as
she
said
i
do
think
he
has
it
to
fire
it
incredible
i
do
believe
it
neither
do
i
sylvia
said
the
minister
earnestly
the
talk
at
the
wares
went
badly
that
evening
harwood
mind
was
on
the
political
situation
as
he
sat
in
the
minister
library
he
knew
that
in
upper
chambers
of
the
state
house
and
in
hotels
and
members
of
the
majority
in
twos
and
threes
or
here
and
there
a
dozen
were
speculating
and
plotting
the
deadlock
was
becoming
intolerable
interest
in
the
result
was
keen
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
the
new
york
and
chicago
newspapers
had
sent
special
representatives
to
watch
the
fight
dan
was
sick
of
the
sight
and
sound
of
it
in
the
strict
alignment
of
factions
he
had
voted
with
thatcher
yet
he
told
himself
he
was
not
a
thatcher
man
he
had
personally
projected
ramsay
name
one
night
in
the
hope
of
breaking
the
bassett
phalanx
but
the
only
result
was
to
arouse
thatcher
wrath
against
him
bassett
men
believed
in
bassett
the
old
superstition
as
to
his
invulnerability
had
never
more
thoroughly
possessed
the
imaginations
of
his
adherents
bassett
was
not
only
himself
again
but
his
iron
grip
seemed
tighter
than
ever
he
was
making
the
fight
of
his
life
and
he
was
beyond
question
a
game
fighter
the
opposition
newspapers
that
most
bitterly
opposed
bassett
tempered
their
denunciations
with
this
concession
dan
fumed
at
this
such
bosses
were
always
game
fighters
they
had
to
be
and
the
readiness
of
americans
to
admire
the
gameness
of
the
bassetts
deepened
his
hostility
the
very
use
of
sporting
terminology
in
politics
angered
him
in
his
mind
the
case
was
docketed
not
as
thatcher
bassett
but
as
thatcher
and
bassett
the
people
it
all
came
to
that
and
why
should
not
the
people
the
poor
meek
people
the
of
familiar
derision
sometimes
win
his
pride
in
the
state
of
his
birth
was
strong
his
pride
in
his
party
was
only
second
to
it
he
would
serve
both
if
he
could
not
only
must
bassett
be
forever
put
down
but
thatcher
also
and
he
assured
himself
that
it
was
not
the
men
he
despised
but
the
wretched
brutal
mediæval
system
that
survived
in
them
and
so
pondering
it
was
no
wonder
that
dan
brought
no
joy
to
john
library
that
night
the
minister
himself
seemed
unwontedly
preoccupied
sylvia
stared
at
the
fire
as
though
seeking
in
the
flames
answers
to
unanswerable
questions
ware
sought
vainly
to
bring
cheer
to
the
company
shortly
after
eight
sylvia
rose
to
leave
aunt
sally
got
home
from
kentucky
this
afternoon
and
i
must
drop
in
for
a
minute
dan
if
you
do
mind
sylvia
hardly
spoke
on
the
way
to
owen
since
that
night
on
the
lake
she
had
never
been
the
same
or
so
it
seemed
to
dan
she
had
gone
back
to
her
teaching
and
when
they
met
she
talked
of
her
work
and
of
impersonal
things
once
he
had
broached
the
subject
of
marriage
soon
after
her
return
to
town
but
she
had
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
was
a
forbidden
topic
the
good
comradeship
ship
and
frankness
of
their
intercourse
had
passed
and
it
seemed
to
his
despairing
lover
heart
that
it
could
never
be
regained
she
carried
her
head
a
little
higher
her
smile
was
not
the
smile
of
old
he
shrank
from
telling
her
that
nothing
mattered
if
she
cared
for
him
as
he
believed
she
did
she
gave
him
no
chance
for
one
thing
and
he
had
never
in
his
bitter
found
any
words
in
which
to
tell
her
so
more
than
ever
he
needed
sylvia
but
sylvia
had
locked
and
barred
the
doors
against
him
owen
received
them
in
her
office
and
the
old
lady
cheeriness
was
grateful
to
both
of
them
so
you
been
having
supper
with
the
wares
have
you
while
i
ate
here
all
by
myself
a
nice
way
to
treat
a
lone
old
woman
leaving
me
to
prop
the
farmer
on
the
coffee
pot
for
company
i
had
to
stay
at
lexington
longer
than
i
wanted
to
and
some
of
my
kentucky
cousins
held
me
up
in
louisville
i
notice
daniel
that
there
are
some
doings
at
the
state
house
i
must
say
it
was
a
downright
sin
for
old
ridgefield
to
go
duck
shooting
at
his
time
of
life
and
die
just
when
we
were
getting
politics
calmed
down
in
this
state
when
i
saw
that
old
look
listen
editorial
printed
like
a
thanksgiving
proclamation
in
the
i
knew
there
was
trouble
i
must
speak
to
atwill
letting
the
automobile
folks
run
the
paper
again
she
demanded
to
know
when
dan
would
have
time
to
do
some
work
for
her
she
had
disposed
of
her
kentucky
farm
and
was
going
ahead
with
her
scheme
for
a
vocational
school
to
be
established
at
waupegan
this
was
the
first
that
dan
had
heard
of
this
project
and
its
bearing
upon
the
hopes
of
the
bassetts
as
the
heirs
apparent
of
owen
estate
startled
him
i
want
you
to
draw
up
papers
covering
the
whole
business
daniel
but
you
got
to
get
rid
of
your
legislature
first
i
thought
of
a
good
name
for
the
school
sylvia
we
call
it
elizabeth
house
school
to
hitch
it
on
to
the
i
want
you
and
daniel
to
go
down
east
with
me
right
after
christmas
to
look
at
some
more
schools
where
they
do
that
kind
of
work
we
have
some
fun
next
spring
tearing
up
the
farm
and
putting
up
the
new
buildings

hallie
and
marian

town
sylvia

at
fraserville
sylvia
replied
and
i
had
a
note
from
blackford
yesterday
he

well
at
school
now
well
i
guess
you
did
that
for
him
sylvia
i
hope
they
all
grateful
for
that
oh
it
was
nothing
and
they
paid
me
generously
for
my
work
humph
owen
sniffed
children
there
are
things
in
this
world
that
a
check
do
settle
there
were
some
matters
of
business
to
be
discussed
dan
had
at
last
received
an
offer
for
the
kelton
house
at
montgomery
and
owen
thought
he
ought
to
be
able
to
screw
the
price
up
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
i
all
ready
to
close
the
estate
when
the
sale
is
completed
said
dan
practically
everything
will
be
cleaned
up
when
the
house
is
sold
that
canneries
stock
that
we
inventoried
as
worthless
is
pretty
sure
to
pan
out
i
refused
to
compromise
that
right
daniel
do
you
compromise
that
case
this
skyrocket
finance
is
all
right
for
new
york
but
we
ca
allow
it
here
in
the
country
where
folks
are
mostly
square
or
trying
to
be
it
seems
hard
to
let
the
house
go
said
sylvia
it
given
mary
a
home
and
we
have
to
find
a
place
for
her
oh
that
all
fixed
remarked
owen
i
got
work
for
her
at
elizabeth
house
she
can
do
the
darning
and
mending
daniel
have
you
brought
the
papers
from
andrew
safety
box
over
here
yes
aunt
sally
i
did
that
the
last
time
i
was
in
montgomery
i
wanted
to
examine
the
abstract
of
title
and
be
ready
to
close
this
sale
if
you
and
sylvia
approved
of
it
well
well
owen
said
in
one
of
those
irrelevances
that
adorned
her
conversation
dan
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
since
that
night
on
waupegan
blessed
forever
by
sylvia
tears
the
letter
found
among
professor
papers
had
led
him
through
long
intricate
mazes
of
speculation
it
was
the
torn
leaf
from
a
book
that
was
worthless
without
the
context
a
piece
of
valuable
evidence
but
inadmissible
unless
supported
and
illuminated
by
other
testimony
illustration
sylvia
must
know
just
what
we
know
sylvia
had
been
singularly
silent
and
owen
keen
eyes
saw
that
something
was
amiss
she
stopped
talking
as
much
as
to
say
now
if
you
young
folks
have
anything
troubling
you
now
your
time
to
come
out
with
it
an
old
clock
on
the
stair
landing
boomed
ten
owen
stirred
restlessly
sylvia
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
clasped
her
hands
abruptly
clenched
them
hard
and
spoke
turning
her
head
slowly
until
her
eyes
rested
upon
dan
dan
she
asked
did
you
ever
know
do
you
know
now
what
was
in
the
letter
you
carried
to
grandfather
kelton
that
first
time
i
saw
you
the
time
i
went
to
find
grandfather
for
you
dan
glanced
quickly
at
owen
answer
sylvia
question
daniel
the
old
lady
replied
yes
i
learned
later
what
it
was
and
aunt
sally
knows
tell
me
tell
me
what
you
know
about
it
commanded
sylvia
gravely
and
her
voice
was
clear
now
dan
hesitated
he
rose
and
stood
with
his
arm
resting
on
the
mantel
it
all
right
daniel
now
that
sylvia
has
asked
she
must
know
just
what
we
know
said
owen
the
letter
was
among
your
grandfather
papers
it
was
an
offer
to
pay
for
your
education
it
was
an
unsigned
letter
but
you
know
who
wrote
it
asked
sylvia
not
lifting
her
head
no
i
do
know
that
he
replied
earnestly
we
have
the
slightest
idea
but
how
did
you
come
to
be
the
messenger
who
gave
you
the
letter
she
persisted
quietly
daniel
never
told
me
that
sylvia
but
if
you
want
to
know
he
must
tell
you
it
might
be
better
for
you
not
to
know
you
must
consider
that
it
can
make
no
difference
now
of
any
kind
it
may
make
a
difference
said
sylvia
brokenly
not
lifting
her
head
it
may
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
that
why
i
speak
of
it
that
why
i
must
know
go
on
daniel
answer
sylvia
question
fitch
gave
it
to
me
it
had
been
entrusted
to
him
for
delivery
by
a
personal
friend
or
a
client
i
never
knew
he
assured
me
that
he
had
no
idea
what
the
letter
contained
but
he
knew
of
course
where
it
came
from
he
chose
me
for
the
errand
i
suppose
because
i
was
a
new
man
in
the
office
and
a
comparative
stranger
in
town
i
remember
that
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
been
in
montgomery
as
though
to
be
sure
i
had
no
acquaintances
there
i
carried
back
a
verbal
answer
which
was
stipulated
in
the
letter
the
answer
was
and
in
what
way
fitch
passed
it
on
to
his
client
i
never
knew
you
did
tell
me
those
things
when
we
found
the
letter
daniel
said
owen
reproachfully
the
old
lady
opened
a
drawer
found
a
chamois
skin
and
polished
her
glasses
slowly
dan
walked
away
as
though
to
escape
from
that
figure
with
averted
face
crouching
by
the
fire
but
without
moving
sylvia
spoke
again
with
a
monotonous
level
of
tone
and
her
question
had
the
empty
ring
of
a
lawyer
interrogatory
worn
threadbare
by
repetition
to
a
succession
of
witnesses
at
that
time
was
bassett
among
the
clients
of
wright
and
fitch
and
did
you
ever
see
him
in
the
office
then
or
at
any
time
owen
closed
the
drawer
deliberately
and
raised
her
eyes
to
affrighted
gaze
daniel
you
better
run
along
now
sylvia
going
to
spend
the
night
here
sylvia
had
not
moved
or
spoken
again
when
the
outer
door
closed
on
harwood
chapter
xxxii
my
beautiful
one
miss
farrell
was
surprised
to
find
her
employer
already
in
his
office
when
she
unlocked
the
door
at
eight
the
next
morning
and
her
surprise
was
increased
when
harwood
always
punctilious
in
such
matters
ignored
the
with
which
she
greeted
him
the
electric
lights
over
dan
desk
were
burning
a
fact
not
lost
upon
his
stenographer
it
was
apparent
that
harwood
had
either
spent
the
night
in
his
office
or
had
gone
to
work
before
daylight
rose
eyes
were
as
sharp
as
her
wits
and
she
recognized
at
a
glance
the
and
papers
relating
to
the
kelton
estate
many
of
them
superscribed
in
her
own
hand
that
lay
on
harwood
desk
she
snapped
off
the
lights
with
an
air
that
implied
reproof
or
could
not
have
failed
of
that
effect
if
the
man
at
the
desk
had
been
conscious
of
the
act
he
was
hopelessly
distraught
and
his
face
appeared
no
less
pallid
in
daylight
than
in
the
electric
glare
in
which
rose
had
found
him
as
the
girl
warmed
her
hands
at
the
radiator
in
the
reception
room
the
telephone
chimed
cheerily
the
telephone
provides
a
welcome
companionship
for
the
office
girl
its
importunities
and
insolences
are
at
once
her
delight
and
despair
rose
took
down
the
receiver
with
relief
she
parleyed
guardedly
with
an
unseen
questioner
and
addressed
harwood
from
the
door
in
the
cautious
apologetic
tone
with
which
wise
office
girls
break
in
upon
the
meditations
of
their
employers
pardon
me
harwood
shall
i
say
you
engaged
it
mr
thatcher
dan
and
replied
with
a
tameness
rose
had
not
expected
say
what
you
please
rose
only
i
do
want
to
talk
to
him
or
see
him
or
anybody
the
clock
in
the
tower
boomed
nine
sombrely
dan
distrusted
its
accuracy
as
he
distrusted
everything
in
the
world
that
morning
he
walked
listlessly
to
the
window
and
compared
the
face
of
the
clock
with
his
watch
he
had
thought
it
must
be
noon
but
the
hour
of
the
day
did
not
matter
greatly
it
all
right
said
rose
meekly
from
the
door
i
told
him
you
were
probably
at
the
state
house
whom
oh
thank
you
rose
and
then
as
though
to
ease
her
conscience
for
this
mild
mendacity
he
added
i
believe
i
did
have
an
engagement
over
there
at
nine
he
said
rose
began
warily
and
then
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
cut
her
short
what
did
he
say
oh
he
was
hot
he
said
if
you
came
in
before
he
found
you
to
say
that
if
you
and
ramsay
did
help
him
deliver
the
freight
he
would
get
action
that
that
the
limit
he
said
did
he
very
well
rose
that
all
rose
virtuously
indexing
the
saw
harwood
as
he
idly
ranged
the
rooms
try
the
hall
door
to
make
sure
it
was
bolted
then
he
stood
at
the
window
of
his
own
room
staring
at
nothing
the
telephone
chimed
cheerfully
at
intervals
ramsay
sought
him
thatcher
had
stationed
one
of
his
allies
at
a
telephone
booth
in
the
state
house
corridor
to
call
the
office
at
regular
intervals
newspaper
reporters
demanded
to
know
where
harwood
could
be
found
the
governor
rankling
under
the
criticism
he
had
brought
upon
his
party
by
the
special
session
wished
to
see
harwood
to
learn
when
if
possible
the
legislature
would
take
itself
home
to
these
continual
importunities
rose
replied
in
tones
of
surprise
regret
or
chagrin
as
the
individual
case
demanded
without
again
troubling
her
employer
the
index
completed
she
filed
papers
smoothed
her
yellow
hair
at
the
wash
stand
exchanged
fraternal
signals
with
a
girl
friend
in
the
office
opposite
and
read
the
courier
report
of
the
senatorial
struggle
with
complete
understanding
of
its
intricacies
rose
it
was
twelve
when
harwood
called
her
he
had
brushed
aside
the
mass
of
documents
she
had
noted
on
her
arrival
and
a
single
letter
sheet
lay
before
him
without
glancing
up
he
bade
her
sit
down
she
had
brought
her
notebook
prepared
to
take
dictation
he
glanced
at
it
and
shook
his
head
the
tired
indifferent
harwood
she
had
found
at
the
end
of
his
night
vigil
had
vanished
he
was
once
more
the
alert
earnest
young
man
of
action
she
admired
rose
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
i
think
you
will
believe
me
if
i
say
that
i
should
ask
them
if
they
were
not
of
importance
of
very
great
importance
all
right
mr
harwood
her
eyes
had
fallen
upon
the
letter
and
her
lids
fluttered
quickly
she
touched
her
pompadour
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
tightened
the
knot
of
her
tie
this
is
on
the
dead
rose
it
concerns
a
lot
of
people
and
important
for
me
to
know
the
truth
and
it
possible
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
help
but
if
you
ca
the
matter
ends
here
he
rose
and
closed
the
door
of
his
room
to
shut
out
the
renewed
jingle
of
the
telephone
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
letter
and
tell
me
whether
you
ever
saw
it
before
she
took
it
from
him
glanced
at
the
first
line
indifferently
looked
closely
at
the
paper
and
gave
it
back
shaking
her
head
we
never
had
anything
like
that
in
the
office
paper
or
machine
either
that
heavier
than
the
stationery
you
had
over
in
the
boordman
building
and
that
a
black
ribbon
we
always
used
purple
and
that
letter
was
copied
you
can
tell
that
that
does
answer
my
question
rose
i
want
to
know
whether
you
ever
saw
that
letter
before
perhaps
you
better
take
another
look
at
it
oh
i
can
tell
any
of
my
work
across
the
street
i
do
know
anything
about
that
letter
mr
harwood
her
indifference
had
yielded
to
respectful
indignation
she
set
her
lips
firmly
and
her
blue
eyes
expressed
surprise
that
her
employer
should
be
thus
subjecting
her
to
i
understand
perfectly
rose
that
this
is
unusual
and
that
it
is
not
quite
on
the
square
but
this
is
strictly
between
ourselves
it
on
the
dead
you
understand
oh
i
do
anything
for
you
that
i
do
for
anybody
yes
sir
i
do
more
but
i
refused
ten
thousand
dollars
for
what
i
know
about
what
happened
in
the
transportation
committee
that
winter
i
was
its
stenog
that
a
lot
of
money
it
would
take
care
of
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
you
know
thatcher
kept
after
me
until
i
had
to
tell
him
a
few
things
i
do
to
him
if
he
did
let
me
alone
i
answer
your
question
straight
and
she
looked
him
in
the
eye
i
never
saw
that
letter
before
and
i
do
know
anything
about
it
is
that
all
to
go
back
again
rose
resumed
dan
patiently
not
many
girls
would
have
the
strength
to
resist
a
temptation
like
that
as
you
did
but
this
is
a
very
different
case
i
need
your
help
but
it
is
for
myself
that
i
trying
to
trace
that
letter
if
it
were
a
matter
of
actual
need
i
should
trouble
you
be
sure
of
that
i
always
thought
you
were
on
the
square
but
you
asking
me
to
do
something
you
would
do
yourself
and
i
told
you
again
that
i
know
anything
about
that
letter
i
never
saw
it
before
she
tapped
the
edge
of
the
desk
to
hide
the
trembling
of
her
fingers
the
tears
shone
suddenly
in
her
blue
eyes
dan
frowned
but
the
frown
was
not
for
rose
she
had
already
betrayed
herself
he
was
confident
from
her
manner
that
she
knew
the
prompt
denial
of
any
knowledge
of
the
fateful
sheet
of
paper
for
which
he
had
hoped
all
night
had
not
been
forthcoming
but
mere
assumptions
would
not
serve
him
he
had
walked
in
darkness
too
long
not
to
crave
the
full
light
the
pathos
of
this
girl
loyalty
had
touched
him
her
chance
in
life
had
been
the
slightest
she
had
been
wayward
and
had
erred
deeply
and
yet
there
were
fastnesses
of
honor
in
her
soul
that
remained
unassailable
her
agitation
distressed
him
he
had
never
seen
her
like
this
he
missed
the
little
affectations
and
the
droll
retorts
that
had
always
amused
him
she
was
no
longer
the
imperturbable
and
ready
young
woman
whose
unwearying
sunniness
and
amazing
intuitions
had
so
often
helped
him
through
perplexities
as
a
matter
of
your
own
honor
rose
you
would
tell
me
but
if
the
honor
of
some
one
else
she
shook
her
head
slowly
and
he
paused
no
she
said
i
only
a
poor
little
devil
of
a
stenog
and
i
been
clear
down
you
know
that
but
i
wo
do
it
i
turned
down
ten
thousand
dollars
and
i
turned
it
down
hard
the
more
important
that
letter
is
the
less
i
know
about
it
i
go
into
court
and
swear
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
it
before
i
do
know
anything
about
it
if
you
want
me
to
quit
it
all
right
it
all
right
harwood
been
mighty
good
to
me
and
i
hate
to
go
but
i
guess
i
better
quit
he
did
not
speak
until
she
was
quite
calm
again
as
a
last
resource
he
must
shatter
her
fine
loyalty
by
an
appeal
to
her
gratitude
rose
if
some
one
you
knew
well
some
one
who
had
been
the
kindest
of
friends
and
who
had
lent
you
a
hand
when
you
needed
it
most
were
in
danger
and
i
needed
your
help
to
protect
that
person
would
you
tell
me
their
eyes
met
she
looked
away
and
then
as
she
met
his
gaze
again
her
lips
parted
and
the
color
deepened
in
her
face
you
do
mean
she
began
i
mean
that
this
is
to
help
me
protect
a
dear
friend
of
yours
and
of
mine
i
should
have
told
you
this
if
it
had
been
necessary
as
hard
for
me
as
it
is
for
you
rose
there
a
great
deal
at
stake
innocent
people
will
suffer
if
i
unable
to
manage
this
with
full
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
you
think
back
six
years
ago
last
spring
and
tell
me
whether
you
have
any
knowledge
no
matter
how
indefinite
as
to
where
that
letter
was
written
you
say
she
began
haltingly
there
a
friend
of
mine
that
i
could
help
if
i
knew
anything
about
your
letter
you
have
to
tell
me
who
it
is
i
rather
not
do
that
i
rather
not
mention
any
names
not
even
to
you
she
was
drying
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
her
brows
knit
she
bent
her
head
for
an
instant
and
then
stared
at
him
in
bewilderment
and
unbelief
and
her
lips
trembled
you
do
mean
my
friend
my
beautiful
one
not
the
one
who
picked
me
up
out
of
the
dirt
she
choked
and
her
slender
frame
shook
and
then
she
smiled
wanly
and
ended
with
the
tears
coursing
down
her
cheeks
my
beautiful
one
who
took
me
home
again
and
kissed
me
she
kissed
me
here
she
touched
her
forehead
as
though
the
act
were
part
of
some
ritual
then
covered
her
eyes
you
do
mean
she
cried
out
suddenly
you
do
mean
it
that
no
it
not
that
far
from
replied
dan
sadly
knowing
what
was
in
her
mind
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
upon
her
he
called
owen
on
the
telephone
and
told
her
he
would
be
up
immediately
then
he
went
back
to
rose
it
was
like
this
harwood
said
the
girl
quite
composed
again
i
knew
him
pretty
well
you
know
the
man
i
mean
after
that
transportation
committee
work
i
guess
he
thought
he
had
to
keep
his
hand
on
me
he
like
that
you
know
if
he
thinks
anybody
knows
anything
on
him
he
watches
them
and
keeps
a
tight
grip
on
them
all
right
you
know
that
about
him
dan
nodded
he
saw
how
the
web
of
circumstance
had
enmeshed
him
from
the
beginning
all
the
incidents
of
that
chance
visit
to
fraserville
to
write
the
sketch
of
bassett
for
the
courier
lived
in
his
memory
something
had
been
said
there
about
madison
college
and
his
connection
with
fitch
office
had
been
mentioned
and
on
the
fears
thus
roused
in
morton
bassett
he
daniel
harwood
had
reared
a
tottering
superstructure
of
aims
hopes
ambitions
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
him
but
now
as
the
first
shock
passed
he
saw
all
things
clearly
he
would
save
sylvia
even
though
bassett
must
be
saved
first
if
thatcher
could
be
silenced
in
no
other
way
he
might
have
the
senatorship
or
dan
would
go
direct
to
bassett
and
demand
that
he
withdraw
from
the
contest
he
was
not
afraid
of
morton
bassett
now
i
had
gone
to
work
for
that
construction
company
in
the
boordman
where
you
found
me
it
was
his
idea
to
move
me
into
your
office
i
guess
you
thought
you
picked
me
out
but
he
gave
me
a
quiet
tip
to
ask
you
for
the
job
well
he
been
dropping
into
the
construction
office
now
and
then
to
see
me
you
know
the
boss
was
never
in
town
and
i
had
much
to
do
he
used
to
dictate
letters
said
he
could
trust
the
public
stenogs
in
the
hotels
and
one
day
he
gave
me
that
letter
to
copy
he
had
written
it
out
in
lead
pencil
beforehand
but
seemed
mighty
anxious
to
get
it
just
right
after
i
copied
it
he
worked
it
over
several
times
before
he
got
it
to
suit
him
he
said
it
was
a
little
business
he
was
attending
to
for
a
friend
we
burnt
up
the
discards
in
the
little
old
grate
in
the
office
he
had
brought
some
paper
and
envelopes
along
with
him
and
i
remember
he
held
a
sheet
up
to
the
light
to
make
sure
it
did
have
a
watermark
he
threw
down
a
gold
piece
and
took
the
letter
away
with
him
after
i
had
moved
into
your
office
he
spoke
of
that
letter
once
one
day
when
you
were
out
he
asked
me
how
much
money
had
been
mentioned
in
the
letter
when
was
that
rose
a
few
days
after
the
state
convention
when
you
shot
the
hot
tacks
into
thatcher
he
had
been
at
waupegan
you
remember
dan
remembered
and
he
recalled
also
that
bassett
had
seen
sylvia
at
owen
the
day
following
the
convention
and
it
was
not
astonishing
that
the
sight
of
her
had
reminded
him
of
his
offer
to
pay
for
her
education
his
own
relation
to
the
matter
was
clear
enough
now
that
rose
had
yielded
her
secret
rose
watched
him
as
he
drew
on
his
overcoat
and
she
handed
him
his
hat
and
gloves
her
friend
the
beautiful
one
would
not
suffer
she
was
confident
of
this
now
that
harwood
was
fully
armed
to
protect
her
keep
after
ramsay
by
telephone
until
you
find
him
tell
him
to
come
here
and
wait
for
me
if
it
all
day
if
you
fail
to
catch
him
by
telephone
go
out
and
look
for
him
and
bring
him
here
in
a
moment
he
was
hurrying
toward
owen
chapter
xxxiii
the
man
of
shadows
the
dome
was
a
great
blot
against
the
stars
when
shortly
after
eight
that
evening
sylvia
entered
the
capitol
all
night
in
the
room
she
had
occupied
on
that
far
day
of
her
first
visit
to
owen
sylvia
had
pondered
it
is
not
for
us
to
know
what
passed
in
that
still
chamber
between
her
and
her
friend
but
it
was
the
way
of
both
women
to
meet
the
truth
squarely
they
discussed
facts
impersonally
dispassionately
and
what
sylvia
had
assumed
her
old
friend
could
not
controvert
not
what
others
had
done
not
what
others
might
do
but
what
course
sylvia
should
follow
this
was
the
crux
of
the
situation
i
must
think
it
out
i
must
think
it
out
sylvia
kept
repeating
at
last
owen
left
her
lying
dressed
on
the
bed
and
all
night
sylvia
lay
there
in
the
dark
toward
morning
she
had
slept
and
later
when
owen
carried
up
her
breakfast
she
did
not
refer
to
her
trouble
except
to
ask
whether
there
was
any
news
owen
understood
and
replied
that
there
was
nothing
sylvia
merely
answered
and
said
then
there
is
still
time
what
she
meant
by
this
her
kind
old
friend
did
not
know
but
she
had
faith
in
her
sylvia
dan
came
but
he
saw
owen
only
later
sylvia
asked
what
he
had
said
and
she
merely
nodded
when
rose
story
was
repeated
again
she
said
yes
there
is
still
time
sylvia
had
kept
her
room
all
day
and
owen
had
rigidly
respected
her
wish
to
be
alone
she
voluntarily
appeared
at
the
evening
meal
and
talked
of
irrelevant
things
of
her
school
work
of
the
sale
of
the
house
at
montgomery
of
the
projected
school
at
waupegan
i
going
out
for
a
while
she
said
after
an
hour
in
the
little
office
i
sha
be
gone
long
aunt
sally
do
trouble
about
me
i
have
my
key
you
know
when
she
had
gone
owen
called
one
of
the
colored
men
from
the
stable
and
gave
him
a
line
to
harwood
with
a
list
of
places
where
dan
might
be
found
her
message
was
contained
in
a
single
line
sylvia
has
left
the
house
keep
an
eye
out
for
her
she
told
me
nothing
sylvia
found
consolation
and
courage
in
the
cold
night
air
her
old
friends
the
stars
whose
names
she
had
learned
before
she
knew
her
letters
did
not
leave
her
comfortless
they
had
unconsciously
contributed
to
her
gift
for
seeing
life
in
long
vistas
when
you
are
looking
at
the
stars
professor
kelton
used
to
say
you
are
not
thinking
of
yourself
it
was
not
of
herself
that
sylvia
was
thinking
she
prolonged
her
walk
gathering
strength
as
the
exercise
warmed
her
blood
planning
what
she
meant
to
do
even
repeating
to
herself
phrases
she
meant
to
use
so
it
happened
that
owen
messenger
had
found
dan
at
the
state
house
and
delivered
the
note
and
that
dan
called
from
a
prolonged
conference
with
ramsay
saw
sylvia
unmistakable
figure
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
stairway
watched
her
making
inquiries
of
a
lounger
saw
men
staring
at
her
it
crossed
his
mind
that
she
was
seeking
him
and
he
started
toward
her
but
she
had
stopped
again
to
question
one
of
the
idlers
in
the
hall
he
saw
her
knock
at
a
door
and
knew
it
was
bassett
room
a
room
that
for
years
had
been
set
apart
for
the
private
councils
of
the
senator
from
fraser
as
sylvia
knocked
several
men
came
out
as
though
the
interruption
had
terminated
an
interview
the
unveiled
face
of
the
tall
dark
girl
called
for
a
second
glance
it
was
an
odd
place
for
a
pretty
young
woman
to
be
seeking
morton
bassett
they
looked
at
each
other
and
grinned
a
single
lamp
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
shed
a
narrow
circle
of
light
that
deepened
the
shadows
of
the
walls
bassett
standing
by
a
window
was
aware
of
a
lighter
step
than
was
usual
in
this
plotting
chamber
he
advanced
toward
the
table
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
waited
till
sylvia
was
disclosed
by
the
lamp
stopped
abruptly
stared
at
her
with
eyes
that
seemed
not
to
see
her
then
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
muttering
i
thought
you
would
come
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
sigh
broke
from
him
hidden
by
the
scraping
of
the
chair
across
the
bare
floor
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
floor
several
times
as
though
now
that
she
had
come
he
had
dismissed
her
from
his
thoughts
then
as
he
passed
near
her
with
slow
heavy
step
she
spoke
i
came
to
talk
to
you
bassett
please
turn
on
the
other
lights
pardon
me
he
said
and
she
heard
his
fingers
fumbling
for
the
switch
by
the
door
in
a
moment
the
room
was
flooded
from
the
chandelier
overhead
and
he
returned
and
sat
down
by
the
table
without
looking
at
her
i
should
have
come
here
but
i
knew
of
no
other
way
it
seemed
best
to
see
you
it
all
right
he
replied
indifferently
he
sat
drooping
as
though
the
light
had
in
itself
a
weight
that
bore
him
down
his
face
was
gray
his
hands
hung
impotently
from
the
arms
of
his
chair
he
still
did
not
meet
her
eyes
which
had
taken
in
every
line
of
his
figure
the
little
details
of
his
dress
even
the
inconspicuous
pearl
pin
thrust
through
the
loose
ends
of
his
tie
a
man
opened
the
door
hurriedly
and
peered
in
bassett
was
wanted
elsewhere
he
said
without
rising
bassett
bade
him
wait
outside
the
man
seemed
to
understand
that
he
was
to
act
as
guard
and
he
began
patroling
the
corridor
the
sound
of
his
steps
on
the
tiles
was
plainly
distinguishable
as
he
passed
the
door
it
all
right
now
bassett
explained
no
one
will
come
in
here
he
threw
his
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
bent
upon
sylvia
a
glance
of
mingled
curiosity
and
indifference
i
understand
she
said
quietly
that
nothing
has
been
done
it
is
not
yet
too
late
the
situation
here
is
as
it
has
been
yes
if
you
mean
out
they
are
waiting
for
me
i
suppose
harwood
is
there
and
mr
thatcher
he
blinked
at
the
names
and
changed
his
position
slightly
i
dare
say
they
are
he
answered
coldly
i
thought
it
best
to
see
you
and
talk
to
you
and
i
glad
i
knew
before
it
was
too
late
his
eyes
surveyed
her
slowly
now
from
head
to
foot
why
was
she
glad
she
had
known
before
it
was
too
late
her
calmness
made
him
uneasy
restless
it
was
a
familiar
characteristic
of
morton
bassett
that
he
met
storm
and
stress
stoically
he
was
prepared
for
scorn
recrimination
tears
but
this
girl
sitting
before
him
in
her
gray
and
plain
hat
with
a
bunch
of
scarlet
flowers
showing
through
the
veil
she
had
caught
up
over
them
seemed
in
no
danger
of
yielding
to
tears
her
voice
fell
in
cool
even
tones
he
had
said
that
he
expected
her
but
she
did
not
know
what
manner
of
meeting
he
had
been
counting
on
in
his
speculations
after
a
long
look
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
i
hope
you
have
thought
you
did
think
i
should
let
them
bring
you
into
it
he
spoke
as
though
this
were
something
due
her
that
she
was
entitled
to
his
reassurance
that
the
threatened
cataclysm
should
not
drag
her
down
with
him
when
she
made
no
reply
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
not
made
himself
clear
and
he
repeated
in
other
terms
that
she
need
not
be
concerned
for
the
outcome
that
he
meant
to
shield
her
yes
i
supposed
you
would
do
that
i
had
expected
that
and
he
went
on
as
though
to
anticipate
her
to
eliminate
the
necessity
for
her
further
explanations
you
have
a
right
to
ask
what
you
please
or
we
can
meet
again
to
arrange
matters
i
am
prepared
to
satisfy
your
demands
in
the
fullest
sense
his
embarrassment
had
passed
she
had
sought
the
interview
but
he
had
taken
charge
of
it
beyond
the
closed
door
the
stage
waited
this
was
the
briefest
interlude
before
the
moment
of
his
triumphant
entrance
sylvia
smiled
an
incredulous
smile
and
shook
her
head
slowly
like
a
worn
tired
mother
whose
patience
is
sorely
taxed
by
a
stubborn
unyielding
child
at
her
knee
her
lips
trembled
but
she
bent
her
head
for
a
moment
and
then
spoke
more
quickly
than
before
as
though
overriding
some
inner
spirit
that
strove
rebelliously
within
her
breast
i
know
almost
all
i
ever
need
to
know
but
there
are
some
things
you
must
tell
me
now
this
is
the
first
and
the
last
time
that
i
shall
ever
speak
to
you
of
these
things
i
know
enough
things
i
have
stumbled
upon
and
i
have
built
them
up
until
i
see
the
horror
the
blackness
and
i
want
to
feel
sure
that
you
too
see
the
pity
of
it
all
her
note
of
subdued
passion
roused
him
now
to
earnestness
and
he
framed
a
disavowal
of
the
worst
she
might
have
imagined
he
could
calm
her
fears
at
once
and
the
lines
in
his
face
relaxed
at
the
thought
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
afford
her
this
relief
i
married
your
mother
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
it
it
was
all
straight
and
you
thought
oh
you
thought
i
came
for
that
you
believed
i
came
to
have
you
satisfy
me
of
her
honor
i
never
doubted
her
and
she
lifted
her
head
proudly
and
that
is
what
you
thought
i
came
for
the
indignation
that
flashed
in
her
first
stammered
sentences
died
falteringly
in
a
contemptuous
whisper
her
words
had
cut
him
deep
he
turned
away
aimlessly
fingering
some
papers
on
the
table
beside
him
then
he
plunged
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
as
though
in
haste
to
exculpate
himself
i
never
meant
that
it
should
happen
as
it
did
i
knew
her
in
new
york
when
we
were
both
students
there
my
father
had
been
ill
a
long
time
he
was
bent
upon
my
marrying
the
daughter
of
his
old
friend
singleton
a
man
of
wealth
and
influence
in
our
part
of
the
state
i
persuaded
your
mother
to
run
away
and
we
were
married
under
an
assumed
name
but
it
was
a
marriage
good
in
law
there
no
question
of
that
you
understand
then
i
left
her
up
there
in
the
adirondacks
and
went
home
my
illness
was
prolonged
and
his
condition
justified
me
in
asking
your
mother
to
wait
she
knew
the
circumstances
and
agreed
to
remain
away
until
i
saw
my
way
clear
to
acknowledging
her
and
taking
her
home
you
were
born
up
there
your
mother
grew
impatient
and
hurt
because
i
could
not
go
back
to
her
but
i
could
not
it
would
have
ruined
all
my
chances
at
home
when
i
went
to
find
my
wife
she
had
disappeared
she
was
a
proud
woman
and
i
suppose
she
had
good
cause
for
hating
me
he
told
the
story
fully
filling
in
the
gaps
in
her
own
knowledge
he
did
not
disguise
the
fact
of
his
own
search
for
the
woman
he
had
deserted
he
even
told
of
the
precautions
he
had
taken
to
assure
himself
of
the
death
of
edna
kelton
by
visiting
montgomery
to
look
at
her
grave
before
his
marriage
to
hallie
singleton
he
had
gone
back
again
shortly
before
he
made
the
offer
to
pay
for
sylvia
schooling
and
had
seen
her
with
her
grandfather
in
the
little
garden
among
the
roses
outside
the
guard
slowly
passed
back
and
forth
sylvia
did
not
speak
her
seeming
inattention
vexed
and
perplexed
him
he
thought
her
lacking
in
appreciation
of
his
frankness
thatcher
knows
much
of
this
story
but
he
does
know
the
whole
he
went
on
he
believes
it
was
irregular
he
been
keeping
it
back
to
spring
as
a
sensation
he
told
those
men
out
there
that
he
can
break
me
that
at
the
last
minute
he
will
crush
me
they
waiting
for
me
now
thatcher
and
his
crowd
probably
chuckling
to
think
how
at
last
they
got
me
cornered
that
the
situation
they
think
they
about
rid
of
morton
bassett
you
left
her
you
deserted
her
you
left
her
to
die
alone
unprotected
without
even
a
name
you
accepted
her
loyalty
and
fidelity
and
then
threw
her
aside
you
slunk
away
alone
to
her
grave
to
be
sure
she
would
trouble
you
again
oh
it
is
black
it
is
horrible
sylvia
was
looking
at
him
with
a
kind
of
awed
wonder
in
her
eyes
for
an
instant
there
had
been
a
faint
suggestion
of
contrition
in
his
tone
but
it
was
overwhelmed
by
his
desire
for
it
was
of
himself
he
was
thinking
not
of
the
deed
in
itself
not
of
the
woman
he
had
left
to
bear
her
child
in
an
alien
wilderness
i
tried
to
do
what
i
could
for
you
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
meant
to
have
cared
for
you
that
no
harm
should
come
to
you
he
said
and
the
words
jarred
upon
his
own
ears
as
he
spoke
them
in
her
face
there
was
less
of
disdain
than
of
marvel
he
wished
to
escape
from
her
eyes
but
they
held
him
fast
messengers
ran
hurriedly
through
the
corridors
men
passed
the
door
talking
in
tones
faintly
audible
but
the
excitement
in
the
rival
camps
communicated
nothing
of
its
intensity
to
this
quiet
chamber
men
had
feared
morton
bassett
this
girl
with
her
wondering
dark
eyes
did
not
fear
him
but
he
was
following
a
course
he
had
planned
for
this
meeting
and
he
dared
not
shift
his
ground
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
i
have
been
grieved
to
see
you
working
for
your
living
i
never
meant
that
you
should
do
that
hereafter
that
will
be
unnecessary
but
i
am
busy
at
any
time
you
say
we
will
talk
of
those
things
there
was
dismissal
in
his
manner
and
tone
he
was
anxious
to
be
rid
of
her
the
color
deepened
in
her
olive
cheeks
but
she
bent
upon
him
once
more
her
patient
wondering
baffling
smile
please
never
propose
such
a
thing
again
bassett
there
is
absolutely
nothing
of
that
kind
that
you
can
do
for
me
you
want
to
make
it
hard
for
me
but
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
that
it
is
right
that
i
should
make
the
only
reparation
that
is
possible
now
this
rang
so
false
and
was
so
palpably
insincere
that
he
was
relieved
when
she
ignored
it
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
your
enemies
waiting
out
there
thought
they
had
you
beaten
i
want
you
to
tell
me
just
how
you
propose
to
meet
thatcher
threat
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
broke
out
angrily
i
going
into
that
caucus
and
beat
thatcher
game
i
going
to
tell
his
story
first
but
do
misunderstand
me
i
going
to
protect
you
i
know
men
and
those
men
will
respect
me
for
coming
out
with
it
i
have
been
in
politics
all
these
years
to
be
beaten
at
last
by
ed
thatcher
i
pledged
votes
enough
to
give
me
a
majority
of
three
on
the
next
ballot
but
i
explode
thatcher
bombshell
in
his
own
hands
i
all
prepared
for
him
i
have
the
documents
the
marriage
certificate
and
the
whole
business
but
you
wo
suffer
you
wo
be
brought
into
it
what
i
going
to
do
about
it
the
failure
of
his
declaration
to
shake
her
composure
disturbed
him
perhaps
after
all
his
contemplated
was
not
so
charged
with
electricity
as
he
had
imagined
nothing
in
his
bald
statement
of
his
marriage
to
her
mother
and
the
subsequent
desertion
had
evoked
the
reproach
the
recrimination
for
which
he
had
steeled
himself
when
she
entered
the
room
he
felt
his
hold
upon
the
interview
lessening
he
had
believed
himself
expert
in
calculating
effects
yet
apparently
she
had
heard
his
announcement
delivered
with
a
brutal
directness
without
emotion
this
is
quite
all
bassett
sylvia
began
after
a
moment
you
have
offered
me
reparation
or
what
you
called
by
that
name
you
deny
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
satisfied
with
that
reparation
certainly
anything
in
reason
it
is
for
you
to
name
the
terms
i
expect
you
to
make
them
adequate
let
us
go
back
a
moment
she
began
smiling
at
the
care
with
which
he
had
chosen
his
last
word
last
night
i
fought
out
for
myself
the
whole
matter
of
your
scoundrelly
cowardly
treatment
of
my
mother
you
can
make
no
reparation
to
her
the
time
passed
long
ago
for
that
and
there
is
absolutely
nothing
you
can
do
for
me
i
will
accept
nothing
from
you
neither
the
name
you
denied
to
her
nor
money
now
or
later
so
there
is
only
one
other
person
whose
interest
or
whose
happiness
we
need
consider
he
stared
at
her
frowning
not
understanding
once
more
as
on
that
day
when
she
had
laughed
at
him
or
again
when
she
had
taken
the
affairs
of
his
own
household
into
her
hands
he
was
conscious
of
the
strength
that
lay
in
her
of
her
power
to
drive
him
back
upon
himself
something
of
his
own
masterful
spirit
had
entered
into
her
but
with
a
difference
her
her
patient
persistence
her
sobriety
of
judgment
her
reasoning
mind
were
like
his
own
she
was
as
keen
and
resourceful
as
he
and
he
was
eager
for
the
explanation
she
withheld
as
though
knowing
that
she
had
driven
in
his
pickets
he
awaited
the
charge
of
her
lines
he
bent
toward
her
feeling
her
charm
yielding
to
the
fascination
she
had
for
him
no
he
said
gently
and
kindly
i
do
see
i
do
understand
you
she
saw
and
felt
the
change
in
him
but
she
was
on
guard
against
a
reaction
he
could
not
know
how
her
heart
throbbed
or
how
it
had
seemed
for
a
moment
that
words
would
not
come
to
her
lips
it
is
to
you
it
is
to
yourself
that
you
must
make
the
reparation
and
you
must
make
it
now
there
may
never
be
a
time
like
this
it
is
your
great
opportunity
you
think
you
ask
he
began
warily
and
she
was
quick
to
see
that
the
precise
moment
for
the
full
stroke
had
not
come
that
the
ground
required
preparation
i
think
she
interrupted
smiling
gravely
that
you
want
me
to
be
your
friend
more
than
that
we
have
long
been
friends
and
deep
down
in
your
heart
i
believe
you
want
my
regard
you
want
me
to
think
well
of
you
and
i
must
tell
you
that
there
a
kind
of
happiness
for
it
must
be
happiness
that
comes
to
me
at
the
thought
of
it
something
there
is
between
you
and
me
that
is
different
somehow
we
understand
each
other
his
response
was
beyond
anything
she
had
hoped
for
a
light
shone
suddenly
in
his
face
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
the
feeling
with
which
he
replied
yes
i
have
felt
it
i
felt
it
the
first
day
we
met
and
because
there
is
this
understanding
this
tie
i
dare
to
be
frank
with
you
i
mean
to
make
your
reparation
difficult
but
you
will
not
refuse
it
you
will
not
disappoint
me
i
mean
that
you
must
throw
away
the
victory
you
are
prepared
to
win
he
shook
his
head
slowly
but
he
could
not
evade
the
pleading
of
her
eyes
i
ca
do
it
it
too
much
he
muttered
it
the
goal
i
have
sought
for
ten
years
it
would
be
like
throwing
away
life
itself
yes
it
would
be
bitter
but
it
would
be
the
first
sacrifice
you
ever
made
in
your
life
you
have
built
your
life
on
lies
you
have
lurked
in
shadows
hating
the
light
you
have
done
your
work
in
the
dark
creeping
hiding
mocking
vanishing
what
you
propose
doing
in
anticipating
the
blow
of
your
enemy
is
only
an
act
of
bravado
there
is
no
real
courage
in
that
when
you
thrust
dan
harwood
into
the
convention
to
utter
your
sneer
for
you
it
was
the
act
of
a
coward
and
that
was
contemptible
cowardice
you
picked
him
up
a
clean
young
man
of
ideals
and
tried
to
train
him
in
your
cowardly
shadow
ways
when
the
pricking
of
your
conscience
made
you
feel
some
responsibility
for
me
you
manifested
it
like
a
coward
you
sent
a
cowardly
message
to
the
best
man
that
ever
lived
not
knowing
not
caring
how
it
would
wound
him
and
you
have
been
a
great
thief
stealing
away
from
men
the
thing
they
should
prize
most
but
you
have
taught
them
to
distrust
it
their
faith
in
their
country
even
more
their
faith
in
each
other
the
shadows
have
followed
you
to
your
own
home
you
have
hidden
yourself
behind
a
veil
of
mystery
so
that
your
own
wife
and
children
do
know
the
man
you
are
you
have
never
been
true
to
anything
not
to
yourself
not
to
those
who
should
be
near
and
dear
to
you
and
you
have
sneered
at
the
people
who
send
you
here
to
represent
them
you
have
betrayed
them
not
once
but
a
hundred
times
and
you
know
it
has
paid
you
are
the
unhappiest
man
in
the
world
but
there
a
real
power
in
you
or
you
could
never
have
done
the
things
you
have
done
the
mean
and
vile
things
you
have
brains
and
a
genius
for
organizing
and
managing
men
you
could
never
have
lasted
so
long
without
the
personal
qualities
that
a
man
must
have
to
lead
men
and
you
have
led
them
down
and
down
to
all
appearances
she
had
spoken
to
dull
ears
occasionally
their
eyes
had
met
but
his
gaze
had
wandered
away
to
range
the
walls
when
she
ceased
he
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
you
think
i
am
as
bad
as
that
he
asked
pausing
by
the
table
and
looking
down
at
her
you
are
as
bad
and
as
good
as
that
she
replied
the
hope
that
stirred
in
her
heart
lighting
her
face
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
sat
down
you
have
the
wit
to
see
that
the
old
order
of
things
is
passing
the
old
apparatus
you
have
learned
to
operate
with
a
turn
of
the
hand
is
out
of
date
now
is
your
chance
to
leave
the
shadow
life
and
begin
again
it
not
too
late
to
win
the
confidence
the
gratitude
even
of
the
people
who
now
distrust
and
fear
you
the
day
of
reckoning
is
coming
fast
for
men
like
you
who
have
made
a
mystery
of
politics
playing
it
as
a
game
in
the
dark
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
of
these
things
but
i
can
see
that
men
of
your
type
are
passing
out
there
would
be
no
great
glory
for
you
in
waiting
to
be
the
last
to
go
and
there
are
things
enough
for
you
to
do
if
you
ally
yourself
with
the
good
causes
that
cry
for
support
and
leadership
you
can
be
far
more
formidable
than
you
have
ever
been
as
a
skulking
trickster
you
can
lead
men
up
as
you
have
led
them
down
the
change
is
coming
i
have
seen
it
coming
he
replied
catching
at
the
one
thing
it
seemed
safest
to
approve
but
she
was
not
to
be
thwarted
by
his
acquiescence
in
generalities
he
saw
that
she
had
brought
him
back
to
a
point
whence
he
must
elect
his
course
but
he
did
not
flinch
at
the
flat
restatement
of
her
demand
you
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
the
senatorship
you
are
not
the
choice
of
the
people
of
this
state
you
must
relinquish
it
you
must
give
it
up
the
earnestness
with
which
she
uttered
her
last
words
seemed
to
her
surprise
to
amuse
him
you
think
he
said
that
i
should
go
back
and
make
a
new
start
by
a
different
route
but
i
do
know
the
schedule
my
transportation
is
good
on
only
one
line
and
he
grinned
at
his
joke
oh
you
will
have
to
pay
your
fare
she
replied
quickly
you
never
done
that
his
grin
became
a
smile
and
he
said
you
want
me
to
walk
if
i
pay
my
way
yes
she
laughed
happily
feeling
that
her
victory
was
half
won
and
you
would
have
to
be
careful
to
stop
look
and
listen
at
the
crossings
the
allusion
further
eased
the
stress
of
the
hour
humor
shone
in
his
gray
eyes
he
consulted
his
watch
frowned
bent
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
then
turned
to
her
with
disconcerting
abruptness
i
have
been
half
the
boss
you
think
me
i
been
hedged
in
cramped
and
shackled
all
these
fellows
who
hop
the
stick
when
i
say
have
their
little
axes
i
must
help
grind
i
fooled
away
the
best
years
of
my
life
taking
care
of
these
little
fellows
and
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
them
it
become
a
little
monotonous
i
can
tell
you
it
begun
to
get
on
my
nerves
for
i
have
a
few
and
all
this
hammering
i
taken
from
the
newspapers
has
begun
to
make
me
hot
i
know
about
as
much
as
they
do
about
the
right
and
wrong
of
things
i
suppose
i
know
something
about
government
and
the
law
too
yes
sylvia
assented
eagerly
he
readjusted
himself
in
his
chair
crossing
his
legs
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
it
be
rather
cheerful
and
comfortable
he
continued
musingly
as
though
unburdening
himself
of
old
grievances
to
be
free
to
do
as
you
like
once
in
a
lifetime
those
fellows
in
thatcher
herd
who
have
practically
sold
out
to
me
and
are
ready
to
deliver
the
goods
are
all
rascals
swung
my
way
by
a
few
corporations
that
would
like
to
have
me
in
washington
it
would
be
a
good
joke
to
fool
them
and
elect
a
man
who
could
be
bought
it
funny
but
i
wondered
sometimes
whether
i
was
growing
tired
of
the
old
game
but
the
new
game
you
can
play
better
than
any
of
them
it
the
only
way
you
can
find
peace
with
a
gesture
he
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
lightly
the
glove
she
had
drawn
off
and
laid
on
the
table
you
believe
in
me
you
have
some
faith
left
in
me
yes
her
hand
touched
his
her
dark
eyes
searched
the
depths
of
his
soul
sought
and
found
the
shadows
there
and
put
them
to
flight
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
a
tenderness
that
was
new
to
all
his
experience
of
life
he
had
not
known
that
there
could
be
balm
like
this
for
a
bruised
and
broken
spirit
this
girl
seeking
nothing
for
herself
refusing
anything
he
could
offer
had
held
up
a
mirror
in
which
he
saw
himself
limned
against
dancing
mocking
shadows
nothing
in
her
arraignment
had
given
him
a
sharper
pang
than
her
reference
to
his
loneliness
his
failure
to
command
sympathy
and
confidence
in
his
home
relationships
no
praise
had
ever
been
so
sweet
to
him
as
hers
she
not
only
saw
his
weaknesses
and
dealt
with
them
unsparingly
but
she
recognized
also
the
strength
he
had
wasted
and
the
power
he
had
abused
she
saw
life
in
broad
vistas
as
he
had
believed
he
saw
it
he
was
not
above
a
stirring
of
pride
that
she
appreciated
him
and
appraised
his
gifts
rightly
he
had
long
played
skillfully
upon
credulity
and
ignorance
he
had
frittered
away
his
life
in
contentions
with
groundlings
it
would
be
a
relief
if
it
were
possible
to
deal
with
his
peers
the
enlightened
the
and
the
fearless
who
strove
for
great
ends
so
he
pondered
while
outside
the
sentinel
kept
watch
like
a
fate
yes
sylvia
was
saying
slowly
you
can
make
restitution
but
not
to
the
dead
not
to
my
mother
asleep
over
there
at
montgomery
oh
not
to
me
what
is
done
is
past
and
you
ca
go
back
there
no
going
back
in
this
world
but
you
can
go
on
you
can
go
on
and
up
no
you
do
see
that
you
do
believe
that
yes
i
believe
it
the
old
life
the
life
of
mystery
and
duplicity
is
over
you
will
never
go
back
to
the
old
way
the
old
way
he
repeated
the
old
unhappy
way
up
there
at
the
lake
you
knew
i
was
unhappy
you
knew
things
right
with
me
things
were
right
because
you
were
wrong
success
had
made
you
happy
the
shadows
kept
dancing
round
you
bassett
troubles
came
largely
from
worrying
about
you
in
time
marian
and
blackford
will
begin
to
see
the
shadows
i
should
think
i
should
think
and
he
saw
that
she
was
deeply
moved
that
a
man
would
want
the
love
of
his
children
i
should
think
he
would
want
them
to
be
proud
of
him
his
children
yes
i
have
thought
enough
of
that
she
had
so
far
controlled
herself
but
an
old
ache
throbbed
in
her
heart
in
college
when
i
heard
the
girls
talking
of
their
homes
it
used
to
hurt
me
more
than
you
can
ever
know
there
were
girls
among
my
friends
whose
fathers
were
fine
men
some
of
them
great
and
famous
and
i
used
to
feel
sure
that
my
father
would
have
been
like
them
i
felt
that
i
should
have
been
proud
of
him
and
suddenly
she
flung
her
arms
upon
the
table
and
bowed
her
face
upon
them
and
wept
he
stood
beside
her
patiently
helplessly
the
suggestion
of
her
lonely
girlhood
with
its
hovering
shadow
smote
him
the
more
deeply
because
it
emphasized
the
care
she
had
taken
to
subordinate
herself
throughout
their
talk
do
you
think
you
could
ever
be
proud
of
me
that
you
might
even
care
a
little
some
day
he
asked
bending
over
her
oh
if
it
could
be
so
she
whispered
brokenly
so
low
that
he
bent
closer
to
hear
the
room
was
very
still
sylvia
rose
and
began
drawing
on
her
glove
not
looking
at
him
she
was
afraid
to
risk
more
there
was
indeed
nothing
more
to
say
it
was
for
him
to
make
his
choice
he
was
silent
so
long
that
she
despaired
then
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
like
one
roused
from
sleep
wait
a
moment
he
said
and
i
will
walk
home
with
you
he
went
to
the
door
and
dispatched
the
guard
on
an
errand
then
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
picked
up
a
pad
of
paper
he
was
still
writing
when
harwood
entered
sylvia
and
dan
exchanged
a
nod
but
no
words
passed
between
them
they
watched
the
man
at
the
table
as
he
wrote
with
a
deliberation
that
dan
remembered
as
characteristic
of
him
when
he
had
finished
he
copied
what
he
had
written
put
the
copy
in
his
breastpocket
and
buttoned
his
coat
before
glancing
at
harwood
if
i
withdraw
my
name
what
will
happen
he
asked
quietly
ramsay
will
be
nominated
sir
dan
answered
bassett
studied
a
moment
fingering
the
memorandum
he
had
written
then
he
looked
at
dan
quizzically
just
between
ourselves
dan
do
you
really
think
the
straight
if
he
is
he
has
fooled
a
lot
of
people
dan
replied
he
had
no
idea
of
what
had
happened
but
he
felt
that
all
was
well
with
sylvia
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
bassett
had
called
him
dan
well
i
guess
the
colonel
the
best
we
can
do
i
out
of
it
this
is
my
formal
withdrawal
hand
it
to
robbins
you
know
him
of
course
it
tells
him
what
i
want
done
my
votes
go
to
ramsay
on
the
next
ballot
i
look
to
you
to
see
that
it
played
square
give
the
colonel
my
compliments
that
all
harwood
called
robbins
from
the
room
where
bassett
men
lounged
waiting
for
the
convening
of
the
caucus
and
delivered
the
message
as
he
hurried
toward
thatcher
headquarters
he
paused
suddenly
and
bent
over
the
balcony
beneath
the
dome
to
observe
two
figures
that
were
slowly
descending
one
of
the
broad
stairways
morton
bassett
and
sylvia
were
leaving
the
building
together
a
shout
rang
out
echoing
hollowly
through
the
corridors
and
was
followed
by
scattering
cheers
from
men
who
were
already
hastening
toward
the
senate
chamber
where
the
caucus
sessions
were
held
somehow
morton
bassett
sturdy
shoulders
his
step
quickened
to
adapt
it
to
the
pace
of
his
companion
did
not
suggest
defeat
dan
still
watched
as
the
two
crossed
the
rotunda
on
their
way
to
the
street
bassett
was
talking
he
paused
for
an
instant
and
looked
up
at
the
dome
as
though
calling
his
companion
attention
to
its
height
sylvia
glanced
up
nodded
and
smiled
as
though
affirming
something
bassett
had
said
and
then
the
two
vanished
from
dan
sight
chapter
xxxiv
we
go
back
to
the
beginning
sylvia
was
reading
in
her
grandfather
library
when
the
bell
tinkled
with
these
words
our
chronicle
began
and
they
again
slip
from
the
pen
as
i
begin
these
last
pages
when
morton
bassett
left
her
at
the
door
of
elizabeth
house
she
had
experienced
a
sudden
call
of
the
truant
spirit
sylvia
wanted
to
be
alone
to
stand
apart
for
a
little
while
from
the
clanging
world
and
take
counsel
of
herself
hastily
packing
a
bag
she
caught
the
last
train
for
montgomery
walked
to
the
kelton
cottage
and
roused
mary
who
had
been
its
lone
tenant
since
the
professor
death
she
sent
mary
to
bed
and
after
kindling
a
fire
in
the
grate
roamed
about
the
small
comfortable
rooms
touching
wistfully
the
books
the
pictures
the
scant
she
made
ready
her
own
bed
under
the
eaves
where
she
had
dreamed
her
girlhood
dreams
shaking
from
the
sheets
she
found
in
the
linen
chest
the
leaves
of
lavender
that
mary
had
strewn
among
them
the
wind
rose
in
the
night
and
slammed
fitfully
a
blind
that
as
long
as
she
could
remember
had
uttered
precisely
that
same
protest
against
the
wind
presumption
it
was
all
quite
like
old
times
and
happy
memories
of
the
past
stole
back
and
laid
healing
hands
upon
her
she
slept
late
and
woke
to
look
out
upon
a
white
world
across
the
campus
floated
the
harsh
clamor
of
the
chapel
bell
and
she
saw
the
students
tramping
through
the
swirling
snow
just
as
she
had
seen
them
in
the
old
times
the
glad
and
happy
times
when
it
had
seemed
that
the
world
was
bounded
by
the
lines
of
the
campus
and
that
nothing
lay
beyond
it
really
worth
considering
but
centre
church
and
the
and
the
shop
where
her
grandfather
had
bought
her
first
and
only
doll
she
bade
mary
sit
down
and
talk
to
her
while
she
ate
breakfast
in
the
little
and
the
old
woman
poured
out
upon
her
the
gossip
of
the
lane
the
latest
trespasses
of
the
greek
professor
cow
the
escapades
of
the
phi
gamma
delta
new
dog
the
health
of
wandless
the
new
baby
at
the
house
of
the
latin
professor
the
of
the
madison
eleven
and
like
matters
that
were
and
that
continue
to
be
of
concern
in
buckeye
lane
rumors
of
the
sale
of
the
cottage
had
reached
mary
but
sylvia
took
pains
to
reassure
her
oh
you
do
go
with
the
house
mary
owen
has
a
plan
for
you
you
have
any
cause
for
worry
but
it
too
bad
to
sell
the
house
like
to
get
a
position
teaching
in
montgomery
and
come
back
here
and
live
with
you
there
no
place
in
the
world
quite
like
this
but
it
quiet
miss
and
the
repairs
keep
going
on
harwood
had
to
put
a
new
downspout
on
the
kitchen
the
old
one
had
rusted
to
pieces
the
last
time
he
was
over
that
was
a
month
ago
he
came
in
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
his
train
he
said
and
i
told
him
to
help
himself
to
the
books
but
when
i
looked
in
after
a
while
he
was
just
sitting
in
that
chair
out
there
by
the
window
looking
out
at
nothing
and
when
i
asked
him
if
he
have
a
cup
of
tea
he
never
answered
not
till
i
went
up
close
and
spoke
again
he
peculiar
but
a
gentleman
you
can
see
that
and
when
he
paid
me
my
wages
that
day
he
made
it
five
dollars
extra
and
when
i
asked
him
what
it
was
for
he
smiled
a
funny
kind
of
smile
he
has
and
said
for
being
good
to
sylvia
when
she
was
a
little
girl
he
peculiar
very
peculiar
but
he
kind
and
when
i
said
i
did
have
to
be
paid
for
that
he
said
all
right
he
guessed
that
was
so
but
for
me
to
keep
the
money
and
buy
a
new
bonnet
or
give
it
to
the
priest
a
very
kind
gentleman
that
harwood
but
peculiar
the
sun
came
out
shortly
before
noon
sylvia
walked
into
town
bought
some
flowers
and
drove
to
the
cemetery
she
told
the
driver
not
to
wait
and
lingered
long
in
the
kelton
lot
where
evergreens
marked
its
four
corners
the
snow
lay
smooth
on
the
two
graves
and
she
placed
her
flowers
upon
them
softly
without
disturbing
the
white
covering
a
farmboy
whistling
along
the
highway
saw
her
in
the
lonely
cemetery
and
trudged
on
silently
but
he
did
not
know
that
the
woman
tending
her
graves
did
not
weep
or
that
when
she
turned
slowly
away
looking
back
at
last
from
the
iron
gates
it
was
not
of
the
past
she
thought
nor
of
the
heartache
buried
there
but
of
a
world
newly
purified
with
long
broad
vistas
of
hope
and
aspiration
lengthening
before
her
but
we
must
not
too
long
leave
the
bell
an
absurd
contrivance
of
wire
and
knob
that
tinkled
rather
absently
and
eerily
in
the
kitchen
pantry
let
us
repeat
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
sylvia
was
reading
in
her
grandfather
library
when
the
bell
tinkled
truly
enough
a
book
lay
in
her
lap
but
it
may
be
that
after
all
she
had
not
done
more
than
skim
its
pages
an
old
life
of
nelson
that
had
been
a
favorite
of
her
grandfather
sylvia
rose
put
down
the
book
marked
it
carefully
as
on
that
first
occasion
which
so
insistently
comes
back
to
us
as
we
look
in
upon
her
mary
appeared
at
the
library
door
but
withdrew
seeing
that
sylvia
was
answering
the
bell
some
one
was
stamping
vigorously
on
the
step
and
as
sylvia
opened
the
door
dan
harwood
stood
there
just
as
on
that
other
day
now
to
be
sure
he
seemed
taller
than
then
though
it
must
be
only
the
effect
of
his
long
ulster
how
do
you
do
sylvia
he
said
and
stepped
inside
without
waiting
for
a
parley
like
that
in
which
sylvia
had
engaged
him
on
that
afternoon
in
june
you
ought
to
try
to
hide
it
is
fair
for
one
thing
and
hiding
is
impossible
for
another
it
too
bad
you
came
said
sylvia
for
i
should
have
been
home
i
came
just
because
i
wanted
to
be
alone
for
a
day
i
came
said
dan
laughing
because
i
did
like
being
alone
i
hope
aunt
sally
is
troubled
about
me
i
had
time
to
tell
her
i
was
coming
here
i
do
believe
i
really
thought
about
it
i
simply
wanted
to
come
back
here
once
more
before
the
house
is
turned
over
to
strangers
oh
aunt
sally
was
worried
half
as
much
as
i
was
she
said
you
were
all
right
she
has
great
faith
in
your
ability
to
take
care
of
yourself
i
pretty
sure
of
it
too
he
said
and
bent
his
eyes
upon
her
keenly
there
was
nothing
there
to
dismay
him
her
olive
cheeks
still
glowed
with
color
from
her
walk
and
her
eyes
were
clear
and
steady
did
you
see
the
paper
paper
he
asked
when
they
were
seated
before
the
fire
no
she
replied
folding
her
arms
and
looking
at
the
point
of
her
slipper
that
rested
against
the
brass
fender
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
the
trouble
is
all
over
ramsay
has
the
senatorship
all
but
the
confirmation
of
the
joint
session
which
is
merely
a
formality
they
conferred
on
me
the
joy
of
presenting
his
name
ramsay
is
clean
and
straight
and
thoroughly
in
sympathy
with
all
the
new
ideas
that
are
sound
personally
i
like
him
he
the
most
popular
and
the
most
presentable
man
we
have
and
his
election
to
the
senate
will
greatly
strengthen
the
party
he
did
not
know
how
far
he
might
speak
of
the
result
and
of
the
causes
that
had
contributed
to
it
he
was
relieved
when
she
asked
very
simply
and
naturally
i
suppose
bassett
made
it
possible
it
could
have
been
you
could
have
brought
it
about
without
him
if
he
had
withdrawn
he
could
have
had
the
nomination
himself
thatcher
supporters
were
growing
wobbly
and
impatient
we
any
of
us
care
to
see
thatcher
occupy
a
seat
in
the
senate
that
has
been
filled
by
oliver
morton
and
joe
macdonald
and
ben
harrison
and
dave
turpie
we
hoosiers
are
not
perfect
but
our
senators
first
and
last
have
been
men
of
brains
and
character
ramsay
wo
break
the
apostolic
succession
he
all
right
you
think
bassett
might
have
had
it
you
have
good
reason
for
believing
that
she
asked
i
could
name
you
the
men
who
were
ready
to
go
to
him
he
had
the
stampede
all
ready
down
to
the
dress
rehearsal
he
practically
gave
away
a
victory
he
had
been
working
for
all
his
life
yes
he
is
like
that
he
can
do
such
things
murmured
sylvia
history
has
been
making
rapidly
in
the
past
hours
bassett
has
bought
thatcher
interest
in
the
and
he
proposes
editing
it
himself
more
than
that
he
was
at
my
office
this
morning
when
i
got
there
and
he
asked
me
as
a
special
favor
to
him
to
take
a
few
shares
in
the
company
to
qualify
me
as
secretary
of
the
corporation
and
said
he
wanted
me
to
help
him
he
said
he
thought
it
about
time
for
indiana
to
have
a
share
in
the
general
reform
movement
talked
about
it
as
though
this
were
something
he
had
always
intended
doing
but
had
been
prevented
by
press
of
other
matters
he
spoke
of
the
canneries
case
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
cared
to
reconsider
my
refusal
to
settle
it
he
put
it
quite
impersonally
said
fitch
told
him
he
could
do
more
than
prolong
the
litigation
by
appeals
and
that
in
the
end
he
was
bound
to
be
whipped
and
i
agreed
on
terms
that
really
were
generous
on
my
part
he
said
all
right
that
he
wanted
to
clear
up
all
his
old
business
as
quickly
as
possible
as
he
left
my
office
i
almost
called
him
back
to
throw
off
the
last
pound
i
had
exacted
he
really
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
my
greed
the
old
spell
he
had
for
me
in
the
beginning
came
back
again
i
believe
in
him
i
never
believed
in
any
man
so
much
sylvia
and
if
he
does
throw
his
weight
on
the
right
side
it
will
mean
a
lot
to
every
good
cause
men
and
women
are
contending
for
these
days
it
will
mean
a
lot
to
the
state
to
the
whole
country
and
so
much
oh
so
much
to
him
just
what
had
passed
between
bassett
and
sylvia
he
only
surmised
but
it
was
clear
that
the
warmth
with
which
he
had
spoken
of
his
old
employer
was
grateful
to
sylvia
he
had
not
meant
to
dwell
upon
bassett
and
yet
the
brightening
of
her
eyes
her
flash
of
feeling
the
deep
inner
meaning
of
her
ejaculation
had
thrilled
him
i
said
more
than
i
meant
to
i
did
come
to
talk
of
those
things
sylvia
i
glad
you
thought
i
should
like
to
know
about
him
i
glad
you
told
me
they
were
quiet
for
a
little
while
then
he
said
sylvia
very
softly
not
that
dan
please
i
ca
bear
to
hear
that
it
will
break
my
heart
if
you
begin
that
she
rose
and
faced
him
her
back
to
the
wall
he
had
come
to
complete
the
declaration
which
the
song
had
interrupted
on
the
lake
and
at
the
first
hint
the
chords
that
had
been
touched
by
the
unknown
singer
vibrated
sharply
bringing
back
her
old
heartache
he
crossed
to
her
quickly
that
he
might
show
her
how
completely
the
memory
of
that
night
had
been
obliterated
that
it
had
vanished
utterly
and
ceased
to
be
like
the
ripple
stirred
to
a
moment
life
by
the
brush
of
a
swallow
wing
on
still
water
he
stood
beside
her
and
took
both
her
hands
in
his
strong
clasp
we
are
going
to
be
married
sylvia
we
are
going
to
be
married
here
now
no
no
she
turned
away
her
head
but
his
arms
enfolded
her
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
her
eyes
and
her
lips
last
of
all
yes
here
and
now
unless
you
say
you
do
care
for
me
that
you
love
me
if
you
say
those
things
i
shall
go
away
she
did
not
say
them
she
clung
to
him
and
looked
long
into
his
face
and
kissed
him
harwood
had
chosen
the
hour
well
sylvia
had
met
bravely
the
great
crisis
of
her
life
and
had
stood
triumphant
and
satisfied
weary
but
content
in
the
clear
ether
to
which
she
had
climbed
but
it
was
a
relief
to
yield
herself
at
last
to
the
sway
of
emotions
long
checked
and
stifled
save
for
her
grandfather
devoted
kindness
and
the
friendship
of
owen
her
experiences
of
affection
had
been
singularly
meagre
she
had
resolved
that
if
dan
should
speak
of
love
again
she
would
be
strong
enough
to
resist
him
but
she
had
yielded
unhesitatingly
at
a
word
and
it
was
inexpressibly
sweet
to
yield
to
feel
his
strong
arms
clasping
her
to
hear
his
protestations
and
assurances
to
know
that
her
life
had
found
shelter
and
protection
she
knew
that
she
had
never
questioned
or
doubted
but
that
her
faith
had
grown
with
her
love
for
him
not
only
had
he
chosen
the
hour
well
but
there
was
a
fitness
in
his
choice
of
place
the
familiar
scene
emphasized
her
sense
of
dependence
upon
him
and
gave
a
sweet
poignancy
to
the
memories
of
her
childhood
and
youth
that
were
enshrined
within
the
cottage
walls
in
this
room
in
the
garden
outside
on
the
campus
across
the
lane
she
had
known
the
first
tremulous
wonderings
and
had
heard
the
first
whispered
answers
to
life
riddles
and
enigmas
and
now
she
knew
that
in
love
lives
the
answer
to
all
things
after
a
little
she
rested
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
to
him
him
and
he
pressed
his
hands
upon
her
cheeks
to
be
ready
for
the
question
he
had
read
in
her
eyes
but
she
faltered
there
are
things
i
have
promised
to
do
for
aunt
sally
we
shall
have
to
wait
a
long
time
not
for
aunt
sally
he
cried
happily
here
she
is
at
the
door
now
i
left
her
and
john
ware
at
dr
wandless
well
well
exclaimed
owen
advancing
into
the
room
and
throwing
open
her
coat
you
said
you
meant
to
get
back
to
the
city
in
time
to
catch
that
limited
for
new
york
and
you
have
got
much
margin
daniel
i
can
tell
you
that
it
seemed
to
the
people
who
heard
of
it
afterward
a
most
romantic
marriage
that
of
sylvia
and
dan
harwood
but
whatever
view
we
may
take
of
this
it
was
certainly
of
all
weddings
the
simplest
they
stood
there
before
the
mantel
above
which
still
hung
the
broken
half
of
a
wheel
owen
very
tall
and
gaunt
was
at
one
side
and
wandless
at
the
other
and
old
mary
abashed
and
bewildered
looked
on
with
dilated
eyes
and
crossed
herself
at
intervals
john
ware
drew
a
service
book
from
his
pocket
and
his
fingers
trembled
as
he
began
for
none
in
the
room
not
even
for
sylvia
had
this
hour
deeper
meaning
than
for
the
gray
soldier
he
read
slowly
as
though
this
were
a
new
thing
in
the
world
that
a
man
and
a
woman
had
chosen
to
walk
together
to
the
end
of
their
days
and
once
his
voice
broke
he
who
in
a
hill
country
far
away
had
baptized
this
woman
into
the
fold
of
christ
the
shepherd
wavered
for
an
instant
as
he
said
elizabeth
wilt
thou
have
this
man
sylvia
lifted
her
head
she
had
not
expected
this
nor
had
dan
but
wandless
had
already
stepped
forward
to
give
her
in
marriage
and
as
she
repeated
her
name
after
the
minister
she
felt
the
warm
reassuring
pressure
of
dan
hand
and
so
they
went
forth
together
from
the
little
cottage
by
the
campus
where
they
had
first
met
nor
may
it
have
been
wholly
a
fancy
of
wandless
that
the
stars
came
out
earlier
that
white
winter
evening
to
add
their
blessing
a
postscript
by
the
chronicler
those
who
resent
as
an
impertinence
the
chronicler
intrusion
upon
the
scene
may
here
depart
and
slam
the
door
if
such
violence
truly
express
their
sentiments
others
averse
to
precipitous
leavetaking
may
linger
hat
in
hand
for
the
epilogue
i
attended
a
public
hearing
by
the
senate
committee
on
child
labor
at
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly
accompanying
my
neighbor
sally
owen
and
we
found
seats
immediately
behind
and
daniel
harwood
there
and
daniel
remarked
owen
as
they
turned
round
and
nodded
to
us
i
found
it
pleasant
to
watch
the
harwoods
who
are
as
may
have
been
surmised
old
friends
of
mine
the
meeting
gathered
headway
and
as
one
speaker
after
another
was
presented
by
the
chairman
i
observed
that
harwood
and
her
husband
frequently
exchanged
glances
of
approval
and
i
afraid
that
profile
and
that
winning
smile
of
hers
interested
me
quite
as
much
as
the
pleas
of
those
who
advocated
the
pending
bill
then
the
representative
of
a
manufacturers
organization
inveighed
against
the
measure
and
my
two
friends
became
even
more
deeply
absorbed
it
was
a
telling
speech
by
one
of
the
lawyers
in
the
state
once
i
saw
dan
cowlick
shake
like
the
plume
of
an
angry
warrior
as
his
wife
turned
toward
him
inquiringly
when
the
orator
concluded
i
saw
them
discussing
his
arguments
in
emphatic
whispers
and
i
was
so
pleased
with
the
picture
they
made
that
i
failed
to
catch
the
name
of
the
speaker
whom
the
chairman
was
introducing
a
nudge
from
owen
caused
me
to
lift
my
eyes
to
the
rostrum
the
next
speaker
is
allen
thatcher
announced
the
chairman
beaming
inanely
as
a
man
always
does
when
it
becomes
his
grateful
privilege
to
present
a
pretty
woman
to
an
audience
having
known
marian
a
long
time
it
was
almost
too
much
for
my
composure
to
behold
her
there
beyond
question
the
woman
in
the
senate
chamber
with
a
single
american
beauty
thrust
into
her
coat
and
a
bewildering
hat
crowning
her
fair
head
a
pleasant
sight
anywhere
on
earth
this
daughter
of
the
honorable
morton
bassett
sometime
senator
from
fraser
but
her
appearance
in
the
legislative
hall
long
dominated
by
her
father
confirmed
my
faith
in
the
ultimate
adjustments
of
the
law
of
compensations
i
had
known
marian
of
old
as
an
expert
golfer
and
the
most
tireless
dancer
at
waupegan
but
that
speech
broke
all
her
records
great
is
the
emotional
appeal
of
a
pretty
woman
in
an
unapproachable
hat
but
greater
still
the
power
of
the
born
i
knew
that
marian
visited
elizabeth
house
frequently
and
told
stories
of
her
own
or
gave
recitations
at
the
saturday
night
entertainments
but
this
was
marian
with
a
difference
she
stated
facts
and
drove
them
home
with
anecdotes
it
was
a
vigorous
breathless
performance
and
the
manufacturers
attorney
confessed
afterward
that
she
had
given
him
a
good
trouncing
when
she
concluded
i
remember
that
her
hand
smote
the
speaker
desk
with
a
sharp
thwack
at
her
last
word
i
was
conscious
that
the
applause
was
started
by
a
stout
bald
gentleman
whom
i
had
not
noticed
before
i
turned
to
look
at
the
author
of
this
spontaneous
outburst
and
found
that
it
was
the
honorable
edward
thatcher
whose
unfeigned
pride
in
his
was
good
to
see
when
the
applause
had
ceased
owen
sighed
deeply
and
ejaculated
well
well
as
we
walked
home
aunt
sally
grew
talkative
i
used
to
say
it
was
all
in
the
book
of
job
and
believed
it
but
there
are
some
things
that
job
did
know
after
all
when
i
put
marian
on
the
board
of
trusteees
of
house
school
it
was
just
to
make
good
feeling
in
the
family
and
i
did
suppose
she
would
attend
a
meeting
but
she
one
of
the
best
women
on
that
job
and
i
loved
the
way
she
drawled
the
name
and
repeated
it
says
they
could
do
without
her
i
guess
between
those
girls
will
make
house
school
go
right
that
investment
will
be
a
dividend
payer
and
there
morton
bassett
that
i
never
took
much
stock
in
why
settled
down
to
being
a
decent
and
useful
citizen
there
ai
a
better
newspaper
in
the
country
than
the
and
that
first
editorial
up
at
the
top
of
the
page
every
morning
he
writes
himself
and
it
got
a
smack
to
it
a
kind
of
pawpaw
and
persimmon
flavor
that
shows
honest
i
guess
settling
up
that
canneries
business
cost
him
some
money
but
things
had
always
come
too
easy
for
morton
and
now
that
they
moved
down
here
hallie
cheered
up
a
good
deal
and
she
shows
signs
of
being
cured
of
the
sanatorium
habit
we
were
passing
round
the
monument
whose
candelabra
flooded
the
plaza
with
light
and
owen
inveighed
for
a
moment
against
automobiles
in
general
as
we
narrowly
escaped
being
run
down
by
a
honking
juggernaut
at
christ
church
corner
it
seems
morton
has
grown
some
she
resumed
he
even
got
big
enough
to
forgive
his
enemies
and
john
ware
says
only
great
men
do
that
you
noticed
that
folks
at
home
column
in
the
well
ike
pettit
runs
that
morton
brought
him
to
town
on
purpose
after
edward
thatcher
closed
out
the
fraserville
paper
i
read
every
word
of
that
column
every
day
it
gives
you
a
kind
of
show
of
cloverfields
and
children
singing
in
the
country
schools
and
rural
free
delivery
wagons
throwing
off
magazines
and
newspapers
and
the
interurban
cars
cutting
slices
out
of
the
lonesomeness
of
the
country
folks
it
certainly
amazing
how
times
change
and
i
want
to
live
as
long
as
i
can
and
keep
on
changing
with
why
these
farmers
that
used
to
potter
around
all
winter
worrying
over
their
debts
to
the
insurance
companies
are
now
going
to
lafayette
every
january
to
learn
how
to
make
corn
pay
and
they
putting
bathrooms
in
their
houses
and
combing
the
hay
out
of
their
whiskers
they
take
their
wives
along
with
to
the
university
so
they
can
have
a
rest
and
learn
to
bake
bread
that
wo
bring
up
the
and
when
those
women
go
home
they
dig
the
nails
out
of
the
windows
to
let
the
fresh
air
in
and
move
the
melodeon
to
the
and
quit
frying
meat
except
when
the
minister
stops
for
dinner
it
all
pretty
comfortable
and
cheerful
and
busy
in
indiana
with
lots
of
human
kindness
flowing
round
and
it
getting
better
all
the
time
and
i
guess
it
always
got
to
be
that
way
out
here
in
god
country
the
end
