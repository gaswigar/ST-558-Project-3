was
flaring

in

chapter
i
a
party
drip
drip
drip
the
rain
came
pouring
down
on
a
certain
september
afternoon
turning
the
tennis
lawn
to
a
swamp
dashing
the
bloom
off
the
roses
spoiling
the
geraniums
and
driving
even
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
to
seek
shelter
inside
the
summer
house
it
was
that
steady
settled
hopeless
rain
that
does
not
hold
out
the
slightest
promise
of
ever
stopping
there
was
not
a
patch
of
blue
to
be
seen
in
the
sky
sufficient
to
make
the
traditional
seaman
jacket
several
large
black
snails
were
crawling
along
the
garden
walk
as
if
enjoying
the
bath
and
the
barometer
in
the
hall
which
started
the
day
at
set
fair
had
now
sunk
below
change
and
showed
no
signs
of
intending
to
rise
again
curled
up
in
a
large
armchair
placed
in
the
bow
window
of
a
a
little
girl
of
about
eleven
years
old
sat
peering
out
anxiously
at
the
weather
it
far
too
wet
she
remarked
cheerfully
it
never
means
to
clear
and
it
four
now
they
ca
possibly
come
so
i
shall
just
settle
down
and
enjoy
myself
thoroughly
she
spoke
aloud
to
herself
a
habit
often
indulged
in
by
solitary
children
and
opening
a
copy
of
screwed
herself
round
into
an
attitude
of
still
greater
comfort
and
set
to
work
to
read
with
that
utter
disregard
of
outer
happenings
which
marks
the
true
lover
of
books
she
was
rather
a
pretty
child
her
features
were
good
though
the
small
face
was
pale
and
thin
her
hair
was
fair
and
fluffy
and
she
had
large
eyes
which
looked
so
very
dreamy
sometimes
that
you
could
imagine
their
owner
was
apt
to
forget
the
commonplace
surroundings
of
everyday
life
and
live
in
a
world
that
was
all
her
own
equally
oblivious
of
the
driving
rain
outside
and
the
cosy
scene
within
sylvia
read
on
so
lost
in
her
story
that
she
did
not
even
notice
when
the
door
opened
and
her
mother
entered
the
room
why
here
you
are
darling
i
thought
i
should
find
you
in
study
i
so
sorry
it
such
a
dreadful
day
for
your
party
sylvia
put
down
her
book
with
a
slam
and
dragging
her
mother
into
the
big
armchair
installed
herself
on
her
knee
and
administered
a
somewhat
choking
hug
oh
mother
dear
i
so
glad
she
declared
i
did
want
a
party
and
i
been
watching
the
rain
all
the
time
and
hoping
it
would
go
on
pouring
sylvia
i
thought
you
would
be
terribly
disappointed
do
you
want
to
see
your
little
friends
not
very
much
but
why
sweetheart
sylvia
squeezed
her
mother
hand
in
her
own
and
sighed
as
if
she
found
it
rather
difficult
to
explain
herself
lots
of
reasons
she
said
briefly
tell
me
what
they
are
why
for
one
thing
i
just
got
to
the
middle
of
where
rowena
is
shut
up
in
front
de
boeuf
castle
and
i
want
to
see
how
she
escapes
i
much
rather
stay
and
read
than
go
racing
round
the
garden
playing
at
spy
but
i
thought
you
liked
effie
and
may
and
the
fergusson
boys
i
hate
boys
declared
sylvia
dramatically
at
least
not
cousin
cuthbert
and
ronald
hampson
but
boys
like
the
fergusson
boys
they
do
nothing
but
tear
about
and
play
tricks
on
one
they
perfectly
hateful
i
did
enjoy
my
last
party
there
one
scrap
they
tease
me
most
dreadfully
every
time
i
meet
them
what
about
they
call
me
tragic
muse
because
they
got
hold
of
one
of
my
pieces
of
poetry
they
made
the
most
dreadful
fun
of
it
and
it
tragic
at
all
it
was
about
the
waltons
baby
and
its
blue
eyes
and
curls
and
dimples
i
did
put
dimples
though
they
read
it
out
pimples
i
do
believe
they
know
what
tragic
means
or
a
muse
either
and
i
do
because
i
learnt
them
in
greek
history
last
month
walton
liked
the
poetry
though
she
said
i
must
copy
it
into
her
album
and
sign
my
name
to
it
and
she
thought
i
might
be
a
poetess
when
i
grew
up
and
she
expected
it
was
that
which
kept
me
so
thin
and
had
you
tried
giving
me
oil
because
she
was
sure
it
would
do
me
good
you
not
going
to
are
you
i
took
some
once
at
aunt
louisa
and
it
was
the
most
disgusting
stuff
i
do
think
you
need
any
more
medicine
just
at
present
so
we
will
spare
you
the
oil
said
lindsay
smiling
perhaps
roy
and
donald
would
have
forgotten
about
the
poem
by
this
afternoon
no
they
would
they
never
forgot
anything
if
it
possible
to
tease
i
far
rather
they
did
come
i
do
want
the
waltons
either
or
the
carsons
it
so
nice
and
quiet
in
here
and
miss
holt
out
and
it
such
a
wet
day
that
there
wo
be
any
callers
and
i
can
have
tea
with
you
in
the
and
father
said
perhaps
he
would
be
back
from
the
office
by
five
and
he
promised
the
next
time
he
was
home
early
that
he
go
through
my
museum
and
help
me
to
label
all
the
shells
and
that
would
be
far
nicer
than
a
party
i
thought
you
enjoyed
playing
with
other
children
dear
said
lindsay
rather
gravely
i
do
think
i
do
replied
sylvia
it
so
hard
to
make
them
play
properly
they
never
can
imagine
things
when
i
tell
the
waltons
there
a
witch
in
the
cupboard
they
look
inside
and
say
there
anybody
there
they
ca
understand
that
you
can
pretend
things
until
they
seem
quite
real
and
yet
it
only
pretending
when
i
told
beatrice
and
nora
jackson
that
i
knew
a
dragon
lived
in
their
coal
house
they
went
and
told
their
governess
and
she
said
she
was
afraid
i
was
not
a
truthful
child
that
was
too
bad
yes
was
it
i
rather
not
go
to
tea
at
the
jacksons
jackson
always
says
i
do
eat
half
enough
beatrice
and
nora
have
four
thick
slices
of
plain
bread
and
butter
before
they
begin
with
jam
or
honey
and
great
basins
of
or
soup
plates
full
of
porridge
for
breakfast
i
think
it
rather
rude
of
people
to
make
remarks
on
what
you
eat
when
you
go
out
to
tea
do
you
it
just
depends
said
lindsay
well
they
do
like
it
themselves
continued
sylvia
the
last
time
the
jacksons
were
here
when
their
nurse
came
to
fetch
them
i
told
her
i
was
sure
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
for
nora
had
eaten
four
buns
and
three
sponge
cakes
and
alfie
had
ten
jam
sandwiches
and
a
piece
of
madeira
cake
i
thought
it
would
please
her
to
hear
they
had
had
so
much
when
they
scold
me
for
eating
so
little
but
she
went
quite
red
in
the
face
and
said
they
were
not
greedy
children
anyway
it
was
hardly
a
happy
remark
i
am
afraid
said
lindsay
you
will
be
wiser
next
time
people
in
books
are
so
much
nicer
than
real
people
said
sylvia
plaintively
if
i
could
have
a
party
and
invite
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
alice
in
wonderland
and
rose
out
of
and
rowena
and
rebecca
and
perhaps
queen
guinevere
and
hereward
the
wake
then
i
should
really
enjoy
myself
ca
you
pretend
that
your
friends
are
heroes
and
heroines
of
romance
said
lindsay
pinching
sylvia
pale
cheeks
you
so
fond
of
that
it
ought
to
be
quite
easy
to
imagine
them
princes
and
princesses
it
not
so
easy
as
you
think
replied
sylvia
shaking
her
head
i
make
up
lovely
stories
about
them
sometimes
and
they
just
go
and
spoil
it
all
i
played
one
afternoon
that
effie
was
an
enchanted
princess
shut
up
in
a
magic
garden
but
she
kept
on
eating
green
apples
instead
of
simply
looking
lovely
among
the
flowers
and
when
i
put
a
wreath
of
roses
round
her
hair
she
said
it
had
earwigs
and
spiders
in
it
and
she
pulled
it
off
i
did
dare
to
tell
her
what
i
was
playing
because
she
laughs
so
but
i
began
a
piece
of
poetry
about
her
only
it
never
got
beyond
the
first
verse
then
that
boy
who
lives
in
the
house
with
the
green
railings
down
the
road
i
do
know
his
name
but
he
has
blue
eyes
and
very
light
curly
hair
once
i
played
for
a
whole
week
that
he
was
sir
galahad
he
exactly
like
the
picture
father
showed
me
in
that
big
book
on
the
table
but
just
when
i
made
up
my
mind
that
he
was
starting
off
to
find
the
holy
grail
he
threw
a
snowball
at
me
and
trod
hard
on
lassie
tail
on
purpose
somehow
i
never
could
manage
to
think
of
him
as
sir
galahad
after
that
now
mother
do
laugh
it
would
be
rather
difficult
i
own
said
lindsay
trying
to
straighten
her
face
i
afraid
you
made
an
unfortunate
choice
in
your
knight
it
just
as
bad
continued
sylvia
if
you
pretend
you
somebody
out
of
a
book
yourself
so
much
depends
upon
other
people
i
was
rowena
in
yesterday
i
had
to
be
rather
haughty
because
you
see
i
was
a
saxon
princess
and
everybody
was
accustomed
to
obey
my
slightest
wish
but
miss
holt
did
understand
it
in
the
least
she
said
if
i
spoke
to
her
again
like
that
she
should
send
me
out
of
the
room
so
i
had
to
be
peter
pan
instead
and
miss
holt
asked
me
if
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
she
was
really
quite
angry
with
me
i
do
wonder
it
does
do
to
mix
up
pretending
with
your
lessons
do
you
know
it
is
raining
nearly
so
fast
now
and
i
certainly
hear
a
cab
coming
up
the
drive
i
believe
some
of
your
friends
are
arriving
after
all
to
have
tea
with
you
why
so
they
are
exclaimed
sylvia
jumping
up
and
running
to
the
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
front
door
and
steps
what
a
nuisance
it
effie
and
may
and
they
brought
the
little
carsons
with
them
they
have
to
play
in
the
schoolroom
and
they
always
want
my
old
dolls
house
i
put
it
away
in
the
cupboard
and
now
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
rummage
it
out
again
it
too
bad
i
thought
they
would
ask
for
it
if
we
played
in
the
garden
do
you
think
i
might
say
i
ca
get
it
oh
no
dear
if
it
will
give
them
pleasure
you
must
certainly
let
them
have
it
run
along
quickly
and
open
the
hall
door
to
welcome
them
it
is
very
kind
of
walton
to
send
them
in
spite
of
the
rain
sylvia
went
but
not
too
fast
or
too
willingly
she
was
not
at
all
pleased
to
see
her
guests
and
would
much
have
preferred
the
afternoon
to
herself
i
never
thought
you
come
she
began
as
the
children
sprang
quickly
from
the
cab
and
ran
up
the
steps
into
the
porch
we
were
so
dreadfully
disappointed
said
effie
we
been
watching
the
weather
all
day
may
nearly
cried
when
it
did
clear
up
and
mother
said
it
would
be
quite
as
disappointing
for
you
and
she
thought
we
could
play
indoors
so
she
telephoned
for
a
cab
and
we
called
for
bab
and
daisy
on
our
way
and
brought
them
with
us
so
saying
she
led
in
the
two
little
mites
in
question
who
were
beaming
with
smiles
at
their
unexpected
drive
oh
our
shoes
cried
may
i
left
them
in
the
cab
and
the
driving
away
stop
stop
and
she
rushed
out
wildly
into
the
rain
the
coachman
drew
up
and
dismounting
from
his
box
gave
her
the
parcel
and
she
hurried
in
before
lindsay
had
finished
saying
good
afternoon
to
the
other
children
we
goin
to
play
wiv
the
dolly
house
announced
daisy
as
sylvia
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
upstairs
and
all
the
lickle
chairs
and
tables
added
bab
as
her
fat
legs
toiled
after
sylvia
said
nothing
she
was
annoyed
for
the
dolls
house
had
been
a
favourite
toy
though
she
was
now
too
old
to
care
to
play
with
it
she
liked
to
keep
its
treasures
intact
and
feared
bab
and
daisy
small
fingers
might
work
havoc
among
the
miniature
furniture
and
dainty
glass
tea
services
she
had
no
brothers
and
sisters
of
her
own
to
spoil
her
things
or
interfere
with
any
of
her
plans
or
games
no
one
in
fact
to
consider
except
her
little
self
and
she
was
so
accustomed
to
keep
the
schoolroom
as
her
special
kingdom
that
it
put
her
out
to
be
obliged
to
share
it
even
for
one
afternoon
she
helped
however
to
take
off
the
carsons
hats
and
coats
to
unbutton
their
boots
to
tie
bab
hair
ribbon
which
had
come
off
and
to
fasten
may
pinafore
then
escorted
her
unwelcome
visitors
downstairs
again
with
the
best
grace
she
could
it
was
not
half
so
interesting
to
have
tea
in
the
with
four
children
she
thought
as
alone
in
the
with
her
mother
a
privilege
which
owing
to
lindsay
many
social
duties
she
did
not
often
get
the
chance
to
enjoy
and
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
either
walton
or
the
cabstand
had
not
been
on
the
telephone
if
sylvia
were
an
ungracious
hostess
however
her
small
friends
at
any
rate
seemed
thoroughly
determined
to
enjoy
themselves
they
much
appreciated
the
honey
the
raisin
buns
and
the
iced
sponge
cake
and
were
especially
delighted
with
the
crackers
which
lindsay
brought
out
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
crackers
though
it
not
christmas
cried
effie
in
astonishment
why
not
said
lindsay
they
are
as
much
fun
now
as
in
december
i
think
here
are
two
for
each
of
you
and
you
may
take
them
upstairs
to
the
schoolroom
and
pull
them
when
you
get
there
there
was
a
general
stampede
for
the
stairs
the
four
guests
racing
up
with
great
enthusiasm
while
sylvia
followed
leisurely
behind
debating
in
her
mind
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
lose
the
key
of
the
cupboard
and
thus
preserve
her
dolls
house
from
meddlesome
hands
the
crackers
will
keep
them
busy
for
a
short
time
she
reflected
and
then
i
can
just
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
and
hide
it
away
behind
the
bookcase
i
give
them
the
picture
puzzles
and
a
box
of
bricks
instead
it
is
all
very
well
however
to
make
plans
but
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
to
carry
them
out
the
young
carsons
knew
perfectly
where
the
dolls
house
was
kept
they
ran
in
front
of
sylvia
into
the
schoolroom
and
flinging
their
crackers
on
to
a
chair
had
opened
the
cupboard
and
were
begging
her
to
lift
down
the
coveted
toy
long
before
she
had
any
opportunity
of
locking
the
door
so
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
yield
to
their
request
though
she
certainly
felt
decidedly
cross
she
placed
the
dolls
house
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
having
rescued
one
or
two
of
the
most
fragile
ornaments
left
bab
and
daisy
to
amuse
themselves
and
turned
her
attention
to
effie
and
may
they
were
jolly
rollicking
little
girls
of
eight
and
nine
who
liked
to
run
about
playing
boisterous
games
much
better
than
sitting
quietly
reading
books
they
had
soon
pulled
their
crackers
and
taken
out
the
whistles
and
lockets
which
they
contained
and
now
began
to
ask
eagerly
what
they
should
do
next
ca
we
play
on
the
landing
said
effie
or
tom
tiddler
ground
suggested
may
there
are
enough
of
us
said
sylvia
besides
i
do
expect
mother
would
like
it
the
last
time
we
played
there
we
broke
the
big
japanese
jar
and
father
was
so
angry
about
it
you
have
seen
these
puzzle
maps
would
it
be
fun
to
try
and
fit
them
together
no
thanks
too
like
lessons
said
may
pulling
a
face
we
hate
geography
added
effie
would
you
care
for
halma
do
know
how
to
play
replied
effie
i
could
soon
show
you
oh
we
do
like
learning
new
games
said
may
i
wish
the
fergussons
had
come
i
thankful
they
did
thought
sylvia
who
was
not
at
all
in
a
nice
temper
to
entertain
her
friends
what
a
bother
effie
and
may
are
i
wish
they
do
something
by
themselves
and
not
trouble
me
i
do
mean
to
show
them
my
museum
even
if
they
ask
shall
i
get
out
the
bagatelle
she
added
aloud
you
know
how
to
play
that
at
any
rate
oh
yes
cried
the
little
girls
helping
her
to
lift
the
large
board
and
unfold
it
on
the
table
that
ever
such
fun
do
you
remember
last
time
we
made
bigger
scores
than
you
did
i
forget
answered
sylvia
but
i
think
it
a
better
game
for
two
than
three
you
get
more
turns
are
you
going
to
play
then
exclaimed
effie
no
i
shall
only
spoil
it
for
you
besides
i
have
to
look
after
bab
and
daisy
you
start
and
i
come
and
score
for
you
presently
the
small
carsons
were
so
happily
employed
with
the
dolls
house
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
need
for
sylvia
to
neglect
her
other
visitors
on
their
behalf
making
them
the
excuse
however
she
allowed
effie
and
may
to
grow
interested
in
their
game
then
creeping
quietly
out
of
the
room
she
fled
downstairs
to
the
study
where
she
had
left
in
the
big
armchair
and
returning
with
it
to
the
schoolroom
she
settled
herself
in
the
window
seat
and
was
soon
so
absorbed
in
the
storming
of
torquilstone
castle
that
she
forgot
the
very
existence
of
her
companions
now
as
fate
would
have
it
the
rain
cleared
up
sufficiently
for
aunt
louisa
to
come
about
five
and
pay
a
call
upon
lindsay
if
she
had
not
arrived
on
that
particular
day
and
at
that
particular
hour
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
events
recorded
in
this
story
might
never
have
happened
at
all
sylvia
was
not
sure
whether
she
altogether
liked
aunt
louisa
who
though
kind
on
the
whole
and
liberal
in
the
matter
of
birthday
and
christmas
presents
had
a
very
keen
pair
of
eyes
that
seemed
to
notice
directly
when
people
were
selfish
or
conceited
or
trying
to
show
off
and
saw
through
excuses
and
humbug
in
a
moment
she
considered
sylvia
spoilt
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
so
but
on
the
other
hand
she
proved
so
when
her
niece
spent
a
day
at
laurel
bank
and
treated
her
as
such
a
sensible
almost
person
that
sylvia
invariably
enjoyed
herself
and
looked
forward
to
going
again
it
was
about
five
when
lindsay
and
aunt
louisa
having
finished
their
chat
in
the
walked
upstairs
to
take
a
peep
into
the
schoolroom
and
see
how
the
children
were
getting
on
they
found
bab
and
daisy
seated
on
the
floor
much
occupied
in
giving
the
dolls
house
babies
their
evening
baths
while
effie
and
may
were
playing
bagatelle
by
themselves
with
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
shouting
and
where
is
sylvia
asked
aunt
louisa
looking
round
in
some
astonishment
for
the
absent
hostess
she
there
said
effie
pointing
to
the
window
seat
she
care
about
playing
go
on
may
it
your
turn
lindsay
walked
across
to
the
window
and
drawing
aside
the
curtains
disclosed
sylvia
squatting
on
her
heels
like
a
turk
in
the
corner
of
the
seat
entirely
taken
up
with
the
adventures
of
the
black
knight
and
his
outlawed
companions
her
mother
pulled
the
book
from
her
hand
sylvia
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
it
is
extremely
rude
of
you
to
sit
reading
and
leave
your
guests
to
amuse
themselves
get
up
this
minute
sylvia
obeyed
with
a
very
red
face
she
had
never
expected
to
be
caught
like
this
they
were
quite
happy
without
she
began
but
meeting
aunt
louisa
eye
she
wisely
left
the
sentence
unfinished
i
sure
they
would
enjoy
some
game
you
could
all
play
together
said
lindsay
if
we
push
the
table
aside
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
for
blind
man
buff
oh
yes
yes
cried
the
little
carsons
bundling
the
dolls
back
into
the
dolls
house
and
dancing
up
and
down
with
excitement
while
effie
and
may
equally
pleased
helped
sylvia
to
put
away
the
bagatelle
let
bab
be
blind
man
begged
daisy
and
turn
me
round
three
times
added
bab
beginning
to
revolve
already
in
delighted
anticipation
both
lindsay
and
aunt
louisa
were
kind
enough
to
join
in
the
game
and
to
institute
several
others
afterwards
so
that
for
an
hour
the
children
had
a
most
enjoyable
romp
which
continued
until
the
carsons
nurse
arrived
to
take
bab
and
daisy
home
even
sylvia
raced
about
when
she
found
her
elders
doing
the
same
and
grew
so
rosy
in
the
effort
that
her
mother
looked
at
her
pink
cheeks
with
approval
goodbye
called
the
four
small
visitors
when
at
last
hats
coats
and
boots
had
been
put
on
and
they
all
hurried
to
start
before
a
threatening
cloud
brought
down
the
rain
again
they
seem
to
have
had
a
lovely
time
and
enjoyed
themselves
so
much
m
said
the
nurse
gathering
up
the
parcels
of
shoes
and
taking
daisy
hand
did
you
enjoy
it
sylvia
dear
asked
lindsay
as
they
stood
in
the
porch
watching
bab
plump
legs
waddling
along
the
drive
in
an
effort
to
keep
pace
with
effie
longer
strides
no
replied
sylvia
not
nearly
so
much
as
having
tea
with
you
why
do
you
care
for
your
friends
sweetheart
because
i
like
being
with
you
and
father
better
that
the
very
whole
of
the
reason
anybody
else
is
such
a
bother
lindsay
smoothed
the
fluffy
hair
which
was
hanging
in
some
disorder
after
an
uproarious
game
of
fox
and
goose
and
bent
down
to
kiss
the
little
face
that
turned
up
so
readily
to
meet
her
own
my
precious
pet
she
murmured
fondly
but
aunt
louisa
shook
her
head
chapter
ii
an
important
decision
gordon
said
lindsay
to
her
husband
on
the
following
evening
when
he
was
enjoying
his
cup
of
coffee
in
the
and
she
judged
him
to
be
in
a
suitable
mood
to
discuss
knotty
problems
i
am
not
at
all
happy
about
sylvia
lindsay
paused
to
take
an
extra
lump
of
sugar
and
to
help
himself
deliberately
to
some
more
cream
why
what
wrong
with
the
child
he
asked
i
thought
she
was
looking
much
as
usual
she
looks
quite
well
replied
lindsay
but
i
do
feel
satisfied
all
the
same
try
a
fresh
tonic
suggested
her
husband
stretching
himself
lazily
in
his
chair
as
he
spoke
a
tonic
would
be
of
absolutely
no
use
then
you
had
better
send
for
fergusson
and
let
him
see
her
it
as
well
to
take
things
in
time
it
not
a
case
for
fergusson
yet
it
has
been
distressing
me
for
some
months
louisa
was
here
yesterday
and
she
noticed
it
also
and
spoke
to
me
most
seriously
about
it
really
blanche
you
alarm
me
what
the
matter
with
sylvia
if
fergusson
can
do
no
good
we
must
take
her
to
a
specialist
it
not
her
body
gordon
it
her
mind
she
a
dear
child
but
she
growing
so
and
sedate
she
more
like
a
little
old
woman
than
a
girl
of
scarcely
eleven
louisa
says
it
most
unhealthy
i
wish
louisa
would
mind
her
own
business
said
lindsay
frowning
i
ca
see
anything
amiss
with
sylvia
i
think
her
ways
are
particularly
charming
yet
they
are
not
natural
at
her
age
she
living
in
a
world
of
dreams
and
books
are
all
very
well
but
it
not
good
for
her
to
be
entirely
buried
in
them
she
has
a
strong
imagination
replied
lindsay
a
thing
louisa
can
never
appreciate
she
inherits
it
from
me
and
i
fully
sympathize
with
her
funny
little
pretendings
yes
when
pretendings
do
take
the
place
of
real
life
sylvia
has
been
such
a
solitary
child
so
accustomed
to
play
by
herself
and
make
her
own
amusements
that
she
has
almost
lost
the
desire
for
young
companions
i
thought
she
had
plenty
of
friends
did
i
meet
some
of
them
going
away
yesterday
as
i
returned
home
yes
but
she
does
enjoy
having
them
here
i
should
be
sorry
gordon
to
believe
our
darling
was
selfish
that
she
most
certainly
is
not
declared
lindsay
emphatically
not
with
us
but
i
afraid
she
does
like
her
small
plans
disturbed
by
other
children
she
not
very
ready
to
give
up
her
own
way
indeed
i
was
obliged
to
scold
her
yesterday
for
reading
a
book
instead
of
entertaining
her
visitors
she
gets
absorbed
in
her
books
too
much
so
she
needs
to
be
made
to
run
about
more
she
such
a
gentle
little
mouse
she
always
prefers
quiet
games
to
a
romp
not
healthy
for
a
child
to
live
continually
with
only
people
we
thought
so
earnestly
about
her
education
and
she
has
been
taught
so
carefully
and
well
that
i
really
believe
we
given
her
a
kind
of
mental
indigestion
lindsay
laughed
she
very
bright
for
her
age
he
said
she
can
talk
about
botany
and
antiquities
as
well
or
better
than
many
an
older
person
rather
have
sylvia
for
a
companion
than
half
the
people
i
know
but
she
must
turn
out
a
prig
and
i
fear
she
in
sad
danger
of
doing
so
if
we
do
take
matters
in
hand
at
once
intellectual
interests
are
delightful
and
we
want
her
to
have
them
but
they
hardly
supply
the
place
of
tennis
and
rounders
at
eleven
years
of
age
she
far
too
thin
and
pale
and
fragile
looking
louisa
says
we
have
been
developing
her
mind
at
the
expense
of
her
body
lindsay
groaned
and
wrinkled
up
his
forehead
into
lines
and
puckers
what
does
louisa
propose
that
we
should
do
then
he
enquired
no
doubt
she
has
some
plan
to
suggest
she
thinks
sylvia
ought
to
be
sent
away
to
school
then
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
talk
it
over
before
christmas
not
at
christmas
at
once
the
september
term
has
only
just
begun
and
it
not
at
all
too
late
whew
but
what
about
miss
holt
we
could
pack
her
off
at
a
moment
notice
her
brother
wife
died
during
the
summer
holidays
and
she
would
be
only
too
delighted
to
go
to
keep
house
for
him
in
derbyshire
and
look
after
his
motherless
children
i
believe
she
did
wish
to
return
here
only
she
did
like
to
break
faith
with
me
we
need
take
her
into
consideration
then
you
actually
propose
to
send
sylvia
away
immediately
i
am
sure
it
would
be
for
the
best
but
where
louisa
knows
the
very
school
miss
kaye
at
aberglyn
where
bertha
harding
was
educated
it
seems
satisfactory
in
every
way
and
the
welsh
mountain
air
would
suit
sylvia
she
looked
so
well
after
that
fortnight
we
spent
at
llandudno
i
should
like
to
know
a
little
more
about
it
first
sylvia
is
such
an
unusual
child
and
would
be
miserable
if
she
were
popped
down
amongst
an
unsympathetic
number
of
girls
and
a
set
of
teachers
who
understand
her
miss
kaye
is
a
clever
woman
i
think
her
system
seems
excellent
i
do
wish
sylvia
to
grow
up
a
kind
of
walking
dictionary
with
her
mind
so
crammed
full
of
greek
latin
and
euclid
that
there
no
room
for
an
original
idea
she
wo
there
the
girls
lead
a
very
rational
healthy
life
with
plenty
of
time
for
games
and
outdoor
exercise
neither
do
i
want
her
conversation
to
consist
of
nothing
but
golf
and
hockey
like
some
of
the
young
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
whom
afraid
i
scarcely
admire
gordon
how
perverse
you
are
louisa
shall
talk
to
you
herself
and
tell
you
everything
about
the
school
that
you
can
possibly
wish
to
know
she
coming
when
we
can
discuss
the
question
thoroughly
and
in
the
meantime
we
must
take
care
that
sylvia
get
the
least
idea
of
what
is
in
the
wind
if
our
little
heroine
could
only
have
known
the
consultations
which
were
taking
place
about
her
future
she
would
no
doubt
have
acted
very
differently
on
the
following
day
but
as
she
was
quite
unaware
that
any
change
was
proposed
she
naturally
went
on
in
her
accustomed
way
with
the
result
that
her
father
who
was
regarding
her
from
a
new
standpoint
noticed
a
good
many
things
to
which
he
had
previously
been
absolutely
blind
in
the
first
place
she
was
dainty
at
breakfast
refused
her
egg
because
it
did
not
happen
to
be
a
brown
one
left
her
toast
when
she
found
that
the
crust
was
burnt
and
helped
herself
to
an
enormous
serving
of
marmalade
which
she
did
not
finish
she
argued
hotly
with
miss
holt
about
some
trifling
point
and
even
took
upon
herself
to
correct
her
mother
she
never
passed
anything
at
table
without
being
asked
jumped
up
and
began
to
read
a
book
before
the
others
had
finished
pretended
not
to
hear
when
she
was
requested
to
ring
the
bell
and
had
to
be
told
twice
that
it
was
nine
before
she
would
go
upstairs
to
the
schoolroom
it
certainly
high
time
we
sent
her
away
thought
lindsay
afraid
with
the
best
of
intentions
we
completely
spoilt
her
louisa
right
she
needs
to
be
among
other
girls
to
have
her
corners
rubbed
off
at
school
there
no
allowance
made
for
fads
and
fancies
and
she
would
be
obliged
to
fall
in
with
the
general
rules
it
will
do
her
good
to
be
of
a
little
less
importance
than
she
is
at
home
strange
that
i
never
noticed
all
this
before
when
aunt
louisa
arrived
therefore
in
the
evening
prepared
to
encounter
a
great
many
objections
to
her
suggestion
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
her
brother
agreed
with
her
so
easily
and
after
listening
to
her
detailed
accounts
of
miss
kaye
excellent
arrangements
consented
quite
readily
that
sylvia
should
be
sent
there
as
soon
as
the
necessary
preliminaries
had
been
settled
and
her
clothing
should
be
considered
in
due
order
a
week
will
be
ample
time
for
that
said
aunt
louisa
miss
saunders
will
soon
run
her
up
a
school
frock
and
you
could
send
anything
else
she
requires
afterwards
blanche
it
would
be
a
pity
for
her
to
lose
more
of
the
term
than
we
can
help
she
wo
like
to
find
herself
in
the
classes
and
now
you
have
made
up
your
minds
it
will
be
better
not
to
let
her
have
too
long
to
think
it
over
i
do
know
what
sylvia
will
say
sighed
lindsay
who
half
repented
of
parting
with
her
darling
i
afraid
she
will
never
forgive
us
i
should
ask
her
replied
aunt
louisa
firmly
she
will
like
it
very
much
when
once
she
gets
there
and
the
improvement
which
it
will
make
in
her
is
well
worth
a
few
tears
at
the
start
i
beg
blanche
that
you
will
not
be
foolish
now
and
stand
in
the
way
of
the
real
good
i
try
not
said
poor
lindsay
wiping
her
eyes
but
when
you
only
the
one
and
she
never
been
away
from
you
before
it
seems
so
hard
to
let
her
go
oh
you
get
over
that
i
felt
just
the
same
when
cuthbert
first
went
to
school
and
i
quite
accustomed
to
it
now
we
ca
expect
to
keep
our
children
always
tied
to
our
apron
strings
i
suppose
not
but
boys
are
different
from
girls
and
sylvia
has
been
such
a
pet
if
she
not
happy
at
heathercliffe
house
she
simply
make
herself
ill
with
fretting
and
the
cure
will
be
worse
than
the
disease
i
sure
she
will
not
do
so
she
will
be
so
interested
in
her
work
and
her
new
companions
that
after
the
first
few
days
of
homesickness
are
over
she
will
settle
down
and
like
her
fresh
life
immensely
you
really
think
so
said
lindsay
well
the
decision
is
made
and
i
suppose
we
must
keep
to
it
now
but
i
dreading
the
moment
when
i
shall
have
to
break
the
news
to
her
to
sylvia
the
announcement
came
as
a
great
shock
she
was
totally
unprepared
for
it
and
the
idea
of
such
a
sudden
change
was
anything
but
a
welcome
one
when
she
fully
understood
that
in
one
short
week
she
was
to
be
banished
to
a
strange
place
among
people
whom
she
had
never
seen
she
clung
to
her
mother
in
such
a
passion
of
tears
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
what
aunt
louisa
would
say
lindsay
would
have
yielded
and
have
begged
her
husband
to
keep
the
child
at
home
after
all
as
it
was
she
did
her
best
to
soothe
her
and
to
paint
the
future
in
as
bright
colours
as
her
fancy
could
depict
i
never
be
happy
again
never
sobbed
sylvia
i
shall
be
as
miserable
as
evelyn
in
little
or
rosalie
in
orphan
they
both
broke
their
hearts
until
the
last
chapter
and
so
shall
i
nonsense
darling
you
must
try
to
be
brave
heathercliffe
house
is
a
most
charming
school
and
i
sure
you
will
be
happy
you
find
ever
so
many
nice
little
girls
of
about
your
own
age
who
will
be
ready
to
make
friends
with
you
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
fun
going
on
as
well
as
lessons
i
want
you
to
make
some
more
friends
i
have
effie
and
may
they
too
young
for
you
you
would
get
on
better
with
girls
rather
older
than
yourself
i
believe
it
will
be
quite
a
new
thing
for
you
to
be
one
of
a
class
i
sure
you
will
like
miss
kaye
if
she
like
the
mistress
in
i
shall
hate
her
declared
sylvia
but
she
not
she
very
kind
and
not
at
all
prim
she
takes
the
girls
the
most
delightful
country
walks
and
sometimes
they
go
down
to
the
beach
you
so
fond
of
the
seaside
are
you
yes
said
sylvia
doubtfully
when
it
holidays
and
you
and
father
are
there
i
shall
have
to
pretend
i
an
outlaw
or
a
hostage
like
richard
in
little
and
that
my
subjects
are
busy
fighting
to
keep
my
kingdom
while
i
away
imagine
anything
you
wish
dear
but
i
do
suppose
you
will
need
to
amuse
yourself
with
pretendings
at
aberglyn
you
will
find
some
fresh
books
there
at
any
rate
there
is
a
large
school
library
i
like
that
but
oh
mother
i
shall
have
my
birthday
at
school
i
sorry
for
that
but
we
can
send
you
your
presents
and
you
shall
have
your
party
when
you
come
home
now
wo
you
be
my
brave
girl
and
cheer
up
i
want
to
begin
to
decide
what
things
you
to
take
with
you
and
what
must
be
left
behind
so
much
had
to
happen
during
sylvia
last
brief
week
at
home
that
from
morning
till
night
the
days
seemed
completely
full
her
usual
lessons
with
her
governess
were
given
up
and
the
schoolroom
turned
for
a
time
into
a
kind
of
outfitting
establishment
miss
saunders
the
dressmaker
was
installed
at
the
table
with
her
sewing
machine
working
at
a
school
frock
and
a
new
autumn
coat
while
her
mother
and
miss
holt
between
them
hastily
finished
winter
underclothes
we
do
know
how
soon
the
weather
may
turn
cold
said
lindsay
and
it
as
well
to
send
everything
at
once
if
we
can
though
i
expect
the
thick
nightdresses
will
have
to
follow
sylvia
found
it
really
rather
exciting
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
parting
from
her
father
and
mother
she
would
have
quite
enjoyed
being
a
person
of
such
great
importance
it
was
decidedly
gratifying
to
have
aunt
louisa
coming
in
every
day
to
consult
about
her
clothes
and
assist
in
choosing
her
new
hat
she
had
never
taken
so
much
notice
of
her
little
niece
before
except
occasionally
to
express
disapproval
and
sylvia
felt
that
at
last
her
aunt
was
giving
her
the
consideration
which
was
only
her
due
then
the
shopping
expeditions
were
great
fun
it
seemed
nice
to
buy
yards
of
hair
ribbon
at
a
time
and
several
pairs
of
boots
and
gloves
as
well
as
a
dozen
pocket
handkerchiefs
a
mackintosh
and
a
pair
of
goloshes
miss
holt
was
kept
busy
marking
her
new
possessions
stitching
tapes
on
stockings
and
lengthening
her
winter
petticoats
she
had
quite
a
number
of
presents
given
her
to
take
to
school
aunt
louisa
surprised
her
one
day
with
a
lovely
green
writing
case
fitted
inside
with
notepaper
envelopes
postcards
and
everything
she
would
be
likely
to
need
for
her
letters
home
including
a
pen
with
an
ivory
handle
and
six
gilt
nibs
there
was
a
key
that
would
lock
and
unlock
it
and
her
initials
were
stamped
in
gold
letters
on
the
top
flap
to
say
that
she
was
pleased
would
hardly
express
her
satisfaction
uncle
george
sent
her
a
paintbox
not
the
ordinary
children
kind
which
she
had
always
had
before
but
one
with
china
pans
of
good
colours
and
proper
sable
brushes
that
had
the
most
delicate
points
and
would
go
neatly
into
corners
that
her
old
ones
would
have
certainly
smudged
her
mother
gave
her
a
beautiful
new
bible
bound
in
morocco
with
many
illustrations
of
eastern
scenes
and
maps
and
a
concordance
at
the
end
you
must
read
a
little
piece
every
day
darling
as
you
do
at
home
though
i
shall
not
be
there
to
explain
it
to
you
miss
holt
has
made
you
this
pretty
marker
to
keep
your
place
and
i
have
put
a
sprig
of
lavender
at
our
favourite
chapter
father
had
bought
her
a
prayer
book
and
hymnbook
in
a
case
to
take
to
church
on
sundays
and
added
a
tiny
purse
in
which
to
keep
her
collection
money
cousin
cuthbert
sent
a
cedarwood
pencil
box
containing
a
penknife
several
new
lead
pencils
an
indiarubber
and
an
ink
eraser
the
cook
made
her
a
box
of
toffee
and
the
housemaid
crocheted
a
toilet
tidy
to
hang
on
her
dressing
table
a
large
new
trunk
had
arrived
and
stood
in
the
spare
bedroom
all
ready
to
be
packed
and
so
many
parcels
were
being
delivered
from
various
shops
that
it
was
quite
an
excitement
to
carry
each
fresh
one
upstairs
to
the
schoolroom
and
open
it
i
hope
miss
kaye
will
find
you
as
well
on
as
other
girls
of
your
age
said
miss
holt
anxiously
as
she
sorted
out
a
few
lesson
books
and
some
pieces
of
music
for
sylvia
to
take
with
her
do
remember
that
is
an
irregular
verb
i
should
be
so
ashamed
if
you
began
as
you
did
last
week
i
wish
you
would
look
up
the
dates
of
the
kings
and
queens
of
england
before
you
go
and
your
weights
and
measures
i
afraid
you
are
not
very
certain
of
some
of
them
especially
square
and
cubic
i
think
you
are
pretty
good
at
spelling
but
i
sure
they
will
consider
you
write
badly
for
nearly
eleven
years
old
you
do
hold
your
pen
properly
and
you
make
so
many
blots
i
hope
they
wo
ask
you
for
the
geography
of
europe
for
you
only
learnt
england
and
physical
outlines
and
when
you
play
clementi
second
sonatina
do
forget
that
you
always
count
the
time
wrong
in
the
fourth
bar
i
have
told
you
about
it
so
often
all
right
miss
holt
replied
sylvia
i
do
my
best
but
i
wish
we
could
lose
old
clementi
i
do
so
hate
the
sonatinas
i
hope
my
new
teacher
will
give
me
some
fresh
pieces
and
wo
bother
with
the
metronome
i
think
it
that
which
makes
me
count
wrong
i
tell
her
it
not
your
fault
anyway
are
you
going
to
teach
your
nephews
and
nieces
in
derbyshire
no
they
all
attend
a
day
school
except
the
baby
who
is
too
young
for
lessons
i
shall
have
plenty
to
do
in
looking
after
them
and
the
house
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
sylvia
in
your
new
life
i
have
tried
to
ground
you
thoroughly
and
any
future
teachers
ought
to
find
you
fairly
upon
most
subjects
there
was
very
little
time
left
even
for
the
final
instructions
which
miss
holt
considered
necessary
the
days
seemed
literally
to
fly
and
the
last
one
came
only
too
soon
for
all
concerned
effie
and
may
called
to
say
much
distressed
at
parting
with
their
playfellow
and
immensely
impressed
by
the
preparations
which
sylvia
was
secretly
extremely
proud
of
being
able
to
show
to
them
you
be
too
big
to
play
with
us
when
you
come
back
said
effie
wistfully
no
i
sha
replied
sylvia
kissing
them
in
a
rather
superior
and
patronizing
manner
i
shall
like
to
have
you
just
as
much
at
my
christmas
party
but
perhaps
i
sha
care
to
romp
about
quite
in
the
same
way
because
you
see
when
i
come
back
i
shall
be
eleven
years
old
and
one
of
miss
kaye
girls
at
heathercliffe
house
chapter
iii
the
third
class
heathercliffe
house
was
a
large
modern
building
which
stood
in
its
own
grounds
about
a
mile
from
the
sea
and
an
equal
distance
from
the
railway
station
at
aberglyn
it
looked
bright
and
cheerful
on
the
october
afternoon
when
a
cab
containing
lindsay
and
sylvia
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
drove
slowly
up
the
drive
to
the
front
door
sylvia
gazing
with
eager
eyes
from
the
window
noticed
the
trim
garden
the
shrubbery
of
laurels
and
rhododendrons
the
beds
still
gay
with
geraniums
and
the
smooth
lawns
where
in
the
distance
she
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
girls
playing
tennis
as
the
cab
passed
under
a
big
chestnut
tree
she
saw
a
little
girl
of
about
her
own
age
run
rapidly
to
the
top
of
a
bank
and
hiding
behind
a
broom
bush
peep
down
with
evident
curiosity
at
the
newcomers
below
she
was
a
bonny
child
with
a
creamy
complexion
blue
eyes
and
thick
straight
brown
hair
tied
with
a
ribbon
that
at
present
hung
over
her
left
ear
she
stared
hard
at
sylvia
as
the
latter
leaned
out
of
the
window
then
seeing
lindsay
in
the
background
she
took
fright
and
dashed
away
among
the
shrubs
even
more
quickly
than
she
had
come
i
wonder
what
her
name
is
and
if
i
shall
like
her
thought
sylvia
she
looks
nice
oh
there
are
some
more
of
them
as
about
half
a
dozen
older
girls
paused
in
a
game
of
croquet
to
glance
at
the
cab
and
several
little
ones
playing
under
a
tree
pointed
eagerly
for
which
they
were
evidently
reproved
by
a
teacher
who
was
with
them
there
was
no
time
however
to
see
further
the
cab
had
drawn
up
at
the
front
steps
the
cabman
was
ringing
the
bell
and
lindsay
was
collecting
small
parcels
and
telling
sylvia
to
jump
out
first
sylvia
felt
very
serious
indeed
when
they
were
ushered
into
the
and
miss
kaye
came
forward
to
meet
them
she
was
a
tall
lady
still
fairly
young
with
a
fresh
colour
brown
eyes
and
thick
coils
of
smooth
auburn
hair
she
had
a
brisk
cheerful
manner
and
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
severe
sort
of
mistress
about
whom
sylvia
had
read
in
katy
did
at
and
and
whom
she
had
been
expecting
to
see
she
welcomed
her
new
pupil
kindly
and
ordered
tea
to
be
brought
in
at
once
our
usual
schoolroom
tea
is
at
five
she
said
but
you
shall
have
yours
here
as
i
know
you
will
wish
to
be
with
your
mother
as
long
as
possible
then
when
you
have
seen
your
bedroom
and
taken
off
your
things
you
will
be
ready
to
make
friends
with
some
of
your
companions
sylvia
sat
very
solemnly
during
tea
listening
to
the
talk
between
miss
kaye
and
her
mother
and
though
the
mistress
sometimes
addressed
a
question
to
her
she
was
much
too
shy
to
answer
anything
except
yes
or
no
she
was
glad
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
miss
kaye
suggested
that
as
lindsay
had
only
a
short
time
left
before
she
must
return
to
the
station
they
would
like
to
look
through
the
school
and
see
both
classrooms
and
dormitories
when
she
tried
afterwards
to
recall
her
first
impressions
of
heathercliffe
house
she
had
only
a
confused
remembrance
of
clinging
very
tightly
almost
desperately
to
her
mother
hand
as
they
were
shown
the
neat
bedrooms
the
large
empty
playroom
the
schoolrooms
with
their
desks
and
blackboards
and
took
a
peep
into
the
where
rows
of
girls
of
all
ages
were
sitting
round
two
long
tables
having
tea
then
came
the
moment
which
she
had
been
dreading
from
the
beginning
that
hurried
last
goodbye
that
final
hug
as
lindsay
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
hastened
down
the
steps
into
the
cab
the
rumble
of
the
departing
wheels
and
the
sudden
sense
that
she
was
left
alone
in
a
school
of
more
than
thirty
girls
and
that
she
did
not
yet
know
one
of
them
even
by
name
an
overwhelming
rush
of
homesickness
swept
over
her
so
bitter
in
its
force
that
she
almost
cried
out
with
the
intensity
of
the
pain
she
stood
still
in
the
hall
with
the
dazed
expression
of
one
newly
awakened
from
a
dream
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
miss
kaye
efforts
at
consolation
and
longing
only
for
some
safe
retreat
where
she
might
escape
to
have
a
little
private
weep
out
of
reach
of
watching
eyes
seeing
the
mistress
pause
to
speak
to
a
teacher
who
came
at
that
instant
from
the
she
seized
the
opportunity
and
dived
into
the
where
she
ran
to
the
window
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
the
coachman
hat
as
he
drove
through
the
gate
and
disappeared
behind
the
trees
and
bushes
which
bordered
the
road
miss
kaye
did
not
follow
her
perhaps
long
experience
had
taught
her
that
it
was
sometimes
best
to
leave
new
girls
judiciously
alone
and
for
a
few
minutes
she
stood
playing
absently
with
the
tassel
of
the
blind
and
struggling
hard
to
keep
back
her
rising
tears
why
had
she
been
brought
to
school
why
had
she
not
begged
her
mother
to
take
her
home
with
her
it
was
cruel
to
send
her
away
it
was
all
aunt
doing
she
was
sure
she
could
never
make
herself
happy
and
she
should
write
to
her
father
and
tell
him
so
perhaps
he
might
relent
and
come
to
fetch
her
i
shall
be
the
most
miserable
girl
in
the
school
she
said
to
herself
far
worse
than
florence
in
new
she
only
a
few
tears
and
i
going
to
cry
quarts
i
know
i
am
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
ready
for
the
expected
deluge
but
life
is
often
very
different
from
what
we
propose
and
before
she
had
time
to
do
more
than
wipe
away
the
first
scalding
drop
she
was
startled
by
a
voice
at
her
elbow
turning
round
hastily
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
little
girl
who
had
run
to
the
top
of
the
bank
to
peep
at
her
as
she
came
up
the
drive
and
who
now
stood
smiling
in
a
particularly
friendly
fashion
miss
kaye
has
sent
me
to
take
you
to
the
playroom
she
said
just
finished
tea
you
had
yours
have
you
so
come
along
what
your
name
asked
sylvia
stuffing
her
handkerchief
back
into
her
pocket
in
a
hurry
and
blinking
the
remains
of
a
drop
off
her
eyelashes
she
was
too
proud
to
care
to
be
caught
crying
like
a
baby
and
hoped
her
companion
had
not
noticed
linda
marshall
i
know
yours
miss
kaye
told
us
this
morning
going
to
be
in
our
class
and
you
to
sleep
in
my
bedroom
because
i
the
only
one
who
has
got
a
room
mate
do
come
miss
kaye
be
cross
if
we
not
quick
we
not
allowed
in
the
at
all
only
she
sent
me
in
to
fetch
you
do
you
like
being
here
asked
sylvia
following
her
new
friend
with
some
deliberation
sh
we
may
speak
in
the
hall
there
i
can
talk
to
you
now
down
the
passage
yes
of
course
i
like
it
everyone
does
we
have
such
jolly
times
now
come
here
pausing
with
her
hand
on
the
door
handle
i
want
to
go
in
quite
suddenly
and
surprise
them
she
flung
the
door
open
and
with
a
giggle
announced
miss
sylvia
lindsay
giving
our
heroine
such
a
vigorous
push
forward
that
she
nearly
fell
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
girls
who
were
standing
close
by
there
were
six
of
them
and
they
had
evidently
been
waiting
to
see
the
new
arrival
though
they
pretended
they
were
only
finding
some
books
and
putting
away
their
paintboxes
they
looked
steadily
at
sylvia
but
no
one
volunteered
a
remark
and
the
silence
would
have
grown
oppressive
had
not
linda
come
to
the
rescue
now
then
she
cried
have
you
all
gone
dumb
sylvia
this
is
our
class
i
tell
you
their
names
connie
camden
hazel
prestbury
marian
and
gwennie
woodhouse
nina
forster
and
jessie
ellis
there
were
only
seven
of
us
before
and
you
make
eight
it
a
much
nicer
number
because
we
can
just
get
up
a
set
of
lancers
by
ourselves
now
without
one
of
the
second
class
joining
i
hope
you
know
the
lancers
a
little
said
sylvia
who
felt
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
six
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
upon
her
we
soon
teach
you
if
you
do
the
dancing
lessons
begin
next
week
and
they
are
such
fun
miss
delaney
is
a
perfect
dear
we
all
adore
her
i
sure
you
think
she
sweet
wo
she
girls
of
course
she
will
said
marian
woodhouse
i
ought
to
know
because
i
learnt
from
miss
delaney
before
i
came
here
we
to
have
the
tarantella
this
term
and
a
skirt
dance
added
hazel
prestbury
have
you
brought
an
dress
with
you
for
dancing
i
do
think
so
replied
sylvia
but
mother
was
going
to
send
some
of
my
clothes
afterwards
i
came
away
in
rather
a
hurry
you
late
though
said
connie
camden
it
nearly
three
weeks
since
we
started
the
term
we
came
back
on
the
of
september
why
did
you
come
then
asked
nina
forster
i
do
know
father
only
decided
to
send
me
a
week
ago
well
you
can
try
to
catch
us
up
but
we
done
twenty
pages
of
the
new
history
said
marian
woodhouse
and
read
the
first
canto
of
we
shall
have
to
tell
you
the
story
i
know
it
thank
you
replied
sylvia
i
had
it
with
my
governess
at
home
oh
said
marian
looking
rather
disgusted
but
i
do
suppose
you
took
any
of
the
notes
and
miss
arkwright
explains
it
quite
differently
from
anyone
else
what
sums
are
you
at
weights
and
measures
said
sylvia
why
we
did
those
in
the
baby
class
we
doing
fractions
now
we
only
just
begun
them
said
linda
do
bother
about
lessons
marian
we
barely
ten
minutes
before
prep
and
i
want
to
show
sylvia
her
locker
the
six
children
who
with
linda
and
sylvia
made
up
class
iii
at
miss
kaye
were
all
very
much
of
an
age
hazel
prestbury
was
the
eldest
a
tall
fair
girl
of
twelve
with
regular
features
and
a
quantity
of
pretty
light
hair
which
fell
below
her
waist
and
of
which
she
was
exceedingly
proud
she
could
be
rather
clever
when
she
troubled
to
work
but
as
that
did
not
often
happen
she
rarely
stood
high
in
her
form
though
she
was
well
advanced
in
music
and
played
better
than
many
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
marian
woodhouse
only
an
inch
shorter
had
a
good
complexion
and
curly
ruddy
hair
plaited
in
a
thick
pigtail
so
far
she
had
easily
kept
head
of
the
class
for
she
was
bright
and
such
a
good
guesser
that
she
often
contrived
to
make
miss
arkwright
think
she
knew
more
than
was
really
the
case
she
liked
to
manage
other
people
to
take
the
lead
and
keep
everybody
up
to
the
mark
and
was
more
of
a
favourite
with
the
teachers
than
she
was
with
her
companions
there
could
have
been
no
greater
contrast
to
her
than
her
sister
gwennie
a
round
rosy
dumpling
of
a
girl
so
gentle
and
quiet
and
unassuming
that
she
scarcely
ever
seemed
to
have
an
opinion
of
her
own
being
content
to
follow
marian
blindly
whom
she
considered
the
cleverest
person
in
the
whole
world
the
girls
often
called
the
pair
voice
and
echo
because
poor
gwennie
so
faithfully
upheld
everything
which
her
elder
sister
said
no
matter
whether
it
proved
right
or
wrong
connie
camden
was
the
jolliest
little
romp
imaginable
she
was
not
at
all
pretty
and
wore
her
lank
colourless
brown
hair
cut
short
like
a
boy
but
she
had
frank
grey
eyes
and
though
she
was
continually
getting
into
scrapes
her
honest
straightforward
ways
atoned
for
much
that
was
lacking
in
other
respects
she
was
one
of
a
large
family
and
had
three
sisters
in
the
school
all
with
the
same
reputation
for
endless
jokes
and
high
spirits
nina
forster
a
graceful
child
of
ten
spoilt
by
her
weak
mouth
and
indecisive
chin
was
generally
lost
in
adoration
of
some
favourite
among
the
bigger
girls
her
friendships
were
of
the
briefest
but
very
hot
while
they
lasted
and
she
seemed
able
to
change
her
affections
so
easily
from
one
object
to
another
that
she
had
a
different
idol
nearly
every
week
jessie
ellis
whose
plain
freckled
little
face
could
look
almost
pretty
when
she
smiled
had
been
placed
in
the
third
class
solely
because
she
was
too
big
to
remain
any
longer
in
the
kindergarten
she
was
dull
at
lessons
having
a
poor
memory
and
a
lack
of
any
power
of
grasping
a
subject
she
was
the
despair
of
miss
arkwright
and
took
her
seat
placidly
at
the
bottom
of
the
form
as
regularly
as
marian
woodhouse
occupied
the
top
sylvia
was
excused
from
preparation
on
this
first
evening
and
was
taken
instead
by
miss
coleman
to
unpack
her
box
and
arrange
her
drawers
heathercliffe
house
had
been
specially
built
for
a
school
and
was
so
designed
that
instead
of
long
dormitories
or
curtained
cubicles
there
were
rows
of
small
bedrooms
each
intended
to
accommodate
two
girls
the
one
which
sylvia
was
to
share
with
linda
marshall
stood
at
the
end
of
the
upper
corridor
it
was
a
pretty
little
room
with
a
pink
paper
and
a
mantelpiece
the
furniture
was
also
in
white
enamel
and
consisted
of
a
washstand
two
chests
of
drawers
and
a
large
wardrobe
fixed
into
the
wall
containing
two
separate
compartments
with
a
drawer
for
best
hats
at
the
bottom
of
each
the
beds
had
pink
quilts
to
match
the
paper
the
jugs
and
basins
were
white
with
pink
rims
while
even
the
mats
on
the
dressing
table
were
made
of
white
muslin
over
pink
calico
sylvia
looked
round
with
approval
she
had
expected
school
to
be
a
bare
cheerless
place
but
this
was
as
dainty
as
her
own
room
at
home
the
walls
were
hung
with
pictures
in
oak
frames
there
was
a
small
bookshelf
beside
each
bed
where
bibles
and
favourite
volumes
could
be
kept
and
the
mantelpiece
was
covered
with
tiny
china
cats
dogs
and
other
animals
which
miss
coleman
said
belonged
to
linda
it
took
some
time
to
arrange
sylvia
possessions
for
the
mistress
was
very
particular
as
to
where
they
were
put
and
informed
sylvia
that
she
would
be
expected
to
keep
them
exactly
in
that
order
and
her
drawers
would
be
examined
once
a
week
your
dressing
gown
is
to
hang
behind
the
door
there
is
a
hook
here
for
your
bath
towel
which
by
the
by
you
are
never
to
leave
in
the
bathroom
your
sponge
must
go
in
the
lefthand
sponge
basket
and
your
bedroom
slippers
under
this
chair
your
coats
must
of
course
always
be
kept
in
the
wardrobe
but
your
boots
are
to
go
downstairs
you
may
lay
your
writing
case
and
paintbox
on
the
chest
of
drawers
or
keep
them
in
your
locker
in
the
playroom
i
glad
i
brought
a
white
nightdress
case
thought
sylvia
it
looks
much
nicer
on
the
pink
bed
than
the
blue
one
mother
nearly
packed
instead
when
i
put
out
my
photos
it
will
feel
more
homey
i
write
to
mother
and
tell
her
all
about
it
when
at
last
everything
had
been
tidily
set
in
its
right
place
and
a
servant
had
carried
the
empty
box
to
the
boxroom
miss
coleman
took
sylvia
to
the
playroom
and
giving
her
a
book
told
her
she
might
read
until
her
companions
came
to
join
her
the
girls
of
the
third
class
did
preparation
and
practising
until
seven
after
which
they
were
allowed
half
an
hour
recreation
until
supper
they
had
the
playroom
to
themselves
as
the
little
ones
had
gone
to
bed
by
that
time
and
the
elder
girls
had
a
separate
of
their
own
precisely
as
the
clock
struck
seven
linda
marshall
hazel
prestbury
connie
camden
and
nina
forster
came
tearing
in
i
thought
we
find
you
here
cried
linda
we
just
through
but
i
do
know
my
history
in
the
least
do
you
hazel
not
a
morsel
miss
arkwright
will
scold
it
dreadfully
hard
though
i
do
suppose
anybody
will
know
it
properly
except
marian
said
nina
oh
yes
marian
she
scrape
through
somehow
she
always
does
look
here
sylvia
if
you
clever
i
wish
you
take
down
marian
woodhouse
we
quite
tired
of
seeing
her
always
top
she
so
conceited
about
it
said
connie
camden
she
thinks
no
one
else
can
do
anything
but
herself
said
nina
forster
yes
do
try
sylvia
said
linda
it
would
be
lovely
if
you
got
above
her
it
would
do
her
ever
so
much
good
oh
do
pleaded
the
others
why
do
you
try
yourselves
asked
sylvia
oh
we
ca
it
no
use
said
connie
but
you
look
clever
and
i
sure
you
be
able
to
learn
things
she
need
think
she
going
to
have
it
all
her
own
way
this
term
because
hush
she
here
said
hazel
quickly
as
the
door
opened
and
marian
came
in
carrying
her
music
case
followed
shortly
afterwards
by
gwennie
and
jessie
ellis
what
shall
we
play
asked
connie
who
had
gone
rather
red
i
do
think
she
heard
she
whispered
to
hazel
said
marian
decisively
here
the
box
oh
no
exclaimed
nina
and
hazel
that
a
stupid
game
we
like
it
at
all
yes
you
do
do
be
silly
come
along
i
vote
for
telegrams
suggested
linda
no
cried
marian
yes
cried
the
others
in
such
overwhelming
majority
that
marian
had
to
give
way
though
she
looked
anything
but
pleased
pencils
and
pieces
of
paper
were
collected
the
eight
girls
seated
themselves
round
the
table
and
each
set
to
work
to
concoct
a
telegram
the
words
of
which
must
commence
with
twelve
letters
read
out
at
random
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
given
the
letters
were
t
c
m
i
c
d
c
i
w
e
a
b
they
proved
a
little
puzzling
to
fit
together
but
after
much
nibbling
of
pencils
and
knitting
of
brows
everybody
managed
to
get
something
written
and
marian
volunteered
to
read
them
out
the
first
happened
to
be
sylvia
she
had
put
tell
charley
mother
cook
dead
come
immediately
will
explain
all
bertha
it
not
bad
said
marian
condescendingly
but
you
do
know
how
to
spell
you
written
well
and
that
the
right
way
too
said
sylvia
indeed
it
not
it
why
even
jessie
ellis
knows
that
i
seen
it
in
a
book
objected
sylvia
who
meant
to
fight
her
own
battles
then
it
must
have
been
a
misprint
i
believe
you
can
spell
it
both
ways
said
hazel
just
like
lily
or
lillie
then
it
and
my
way
the
best
declared
marian
who
loved
to
argue
oh
get
on
and
never
mind
cried
linda
we
want
to
hear
the
other
telegrams
what
does
it
matter
how
we
spell
them
at
seven
a
tray
with
glasses
of
milk
and
plates
of
and
biscuits
was
brought
into
the
room
and
when
supper
was
finished
mercy
ingledew
the
monitress
came
to
see
that
all
went
off
to
their
bedrooms
going
upstairs
with
them
to
help
to
plait
their
hair
and
superintend
the
due
brushing
of
teeth
and
the
tidy
disposal
of
clothes
from
the
beginning
it
had
seemed
so
new
and
strange
and
exciting
that
sylvia
had
not
yet
found
time
for
the
tears
which
she
had
fully
intended
to
shed
and
it
was
only
when
she
was
in
bed
and
the
light
turned
out
that
she
suddenly
remembered
how
homesick
she
was
even
then
the
fresh
events
kept
mixing
themselves
up
with
her
regrets
and
as
she
mopped
her
cheeks
with
her
damp
pocket
handkerchief
she
thought
it
much
more
interesting
than
i
expected
i
shall
like
linda
but
marian
woodhouse
need
think
she
going
to
teach
me
everything
i
dare
say
i
can
learn
lessons
as
well
as
she
does
it
would
be
lovely
if
i
could
be
head
of
the
class
i
going
to
try
and
try
just
as
hard
as
i
possibly
can
and
then
i
could
write
to
mother
and
tell
her
i
was
top
and
with
this
meritorious
resolution
she
fell
asleep
chapter
iv
a
first
day
at
school
there
were
girls
at
heathercliffe
house
and
they
were
divided
into
four
forms
miss
kaye
herself
taught
the
first
class
miss
barrett
the
second
miss
arkwright
the
third
and
miss
coleman
the
kindergarten
while
mademoiselle
took
french
and
needlework
and
miss
denby
the
music
a
few
elder
girls
however
learning
from
a
master
who
came
twice
a
week
to
give
lessons
sylvia
found
that
she
very
soon
settled
down
into
the
ordinary
routine
of
her
new
life
miss
kaye
was
kind
and
tried
to
make
school
seem
as
much
like
home
as
possible
there
were
a
certain
number
of
clearly
defined
rules
but
on
the
whole
the
pupils
were
allowed
a
good
deal
of
liberty
which
she
trusted
to
their
sense
of
honour
not
to
abuse
four
of
the
eldest
girls
were
monitresses
responsible
for
the
behaviour
of
the
third
and
fourth
forms
and
the
younger
ones
were
encouraged
to
come
to
them
with
their
troubles
or
difficulties
you
see
telling
a
monitress
is
like
telling
a
teacher
said
linda
and
mercy
ingledew
so
nice
she
never
makes
mischief
glad
she
on
our
landing
instead
of
kathleen
gilchrist
to
linda
sylvia
had
been
attracted
at
once
and
when
she
found
that
her
liked
the
same
occupations
and
the
same
books
as
herself
had
read
and
little
and
was
just
beginning
she
felt
the
friendship
was
sealed
linda
was
certainly
a
very
different
companion
from
effie
and
may
or
any
of
the
other
children
whom
sylvia
had
known
at
home
she
seemed
so
much
older
and
more
sensible
and
was
interested
in
many
things
which
she
was
only
too
pleased
to
explain
to
her
new
friend
you
must
come
and
see
our
gardens
she
said
on
the
first
morning
when
lessons
were
over
and
the
girls
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
grounds
they
over
here
at
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
we
may
each
have
a
small
one
of
our
own
or
share
a
double
one
they
do
look
very
nice
now
because
of
course
we
could
take
care
of
them
in
the
holidays
and
the
weeds
grew
so
dreadfully
but
it
getting
time
to
dig
them
up
and
plant
bulbs
this
is
mine
there
is
much
in
it
now
the
annuals
are
over
if
you
like
i
give
it
up
and
join
at
a
larger
one
with
you
that
would
be
jolly
said
sylvia
if
there
one
to
spare
oh
yes
nobody
has
that
big
double
one
by
the
cucumber
frame
shall
we
begin
now
to
weed
and
on
saturday
we
can
move
out
any
plants
we
want
and
decide
what
we
put
in
it
come
along
for
the
gardening
tools
i
shall
have
to
lend
you
mine
the
tools
were
kept
in
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
linda
had
a
dear
little
set
of
spade
rake
hoe
trowel
and
basket
so
the
pair
set
to
work
at
once
upon
the
new
patch
of
ground
please
dig
carefully
said
linda
in
case
we
come
across
any
treasures
this
piece
belonged
to
ellie
turner
and
sophy
hardman
and
they
may
have
left
something
in
it
yes
i
believe
that
a
clump
of
daffodils
i
remember
they
had
some
and
there
was
a
root
of
in
the
corner
if
no
one
else
has
taken
it
away
could
we
do
anything
special
with
our
garden
asked
sylvia
what
do
you
mean
by
special
said
linda
something
that
would
be
different
from
anybody
else
could
we
put
our
names
in
flowers
we
might
sow
them
in
mustard
and
cress
in
the
spring
yes
but
now
suppose
we
put
linda
at
one
end
and
sylvia
at
the
other
in
white
stones
oh
that
would
be
lovely
what
a
glorious
idea
we
borrow
sadie
thompson
wheelbarrow
and
do
it
at
once
how
did
you
think
of
such
a
jolly
thing
i
wonder
where
sadie
is
we
go
and
look
for
her
it
was
a
vain
search
however
for
sadie
could
not
be
found
and
nobody
appeared
to
know
where
she
was
so
after
hunting
for
some
time
linda
gave
it
up
what
a
nuisance
she
cried
i
shall
take
it
out
without
asking
her
we
really
ca
wait
i
do
suppose
she
mind
we
sha
do
it
any
harm
and
she
trundled
the
little
barrow
out
of
the
shed
and
wheeled
it
to
the
farther
end
of
the
back
carriage
drive
where
she
thought
they
might
find
some
stones
heathercliffe
house
had
the
most
delightful
garden
in
front
were
two
large
lawns
an
upper
one
used
for
croquet
and
a
lower
one
for
tennis
between
the
two
was
a
rosery
where
a
great
many
beautiful
roses
were
still
blooming
although
it
was
now
october
on
miss
kaye
birthday
said
linda
we
always
make
her
a
garland
and
put
it
on
her
head
she
laughs
but
she
wears
it
for
a
little
while
and
it
looks
so
nice
the
front
carriage
drive
was
well
rolled
and
kept
very
neatly
but
the
back
one
was
just
like
a
country
lane
there
were
thick
trees
on
each
side
with
grass
and
wild
flowers
growing
between
and
in
a
corner
near
the
gate
was
a
small
disused
quarry
with
high
rocky
sides
covered
with
gorse
bushes
and
long
brambles
linda
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
place
to
find
stones
there
were
any
number
lying
about
and
though
they
were
not
white
ones
they
were
a
very
light
grey
colour
there
were
a
few
blackberries
still
remaining
on
the
brambles
but
the
ripest
hung
far
out
of
reach
and
were
quite
impossible
to
pick
though
sylvia
scratched
herself
in
a
vain
attempt
it
no
use
i
best
give
them
up
and
stick
to
the
stones
she
said
if
we
ever
go
down
to
the
beach
we
might
bring
back
some
shells
too
do
you
find
any
here
yes
lots
at
one
particular
place
pink
and
white
and
yellow
ones
they
look
pretty
as
an
edging
but
it
would
take
a
fearful
long
time
to
fetch
enough
to
go
far
i
expect
we
shall
need
a
great
many
barrows
of
stones
before
we
can
make
both
our
names
i
would
pick
up
too
small
ones
if
i
were
you
there
i
ca
possibly
wheel
any
more
so
we
better
start
the
barrow
was
heavy
and
they
took
it
in
turns
it
seemed
a
long
way
all
round
the
back
drive
through
the
rosery
and
along
the
avenue
till
they
reached
their
own
garden
and
tipped
the
stones
down
in
a
heap
a
very
small
pile
it
looked
too
only
sufficient
for
about
three
letters
and
they
sighed
to
think
of
the
number
of
journeys
that
would
be
needed
before
their
great
scheme
was
complete
off
they
went
again
however
to
the
quarry
and
refilled
the
barrow
as
fast
as
they
could
there
ca
be
very
much
time
before
dinner
said
linda
though
i
have
heard
the
first
bell
yet
we
must
get
on
as
quickly
as
we
can
because
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
if
there
was
time
to
put
sadie
barrow
away
we
have
to
run
in
the
very
second
we
hear
the
bell
and
wash
our
hands
it
full
enough
now
said
sylvia
i
start
with
it
first
jog
me
or
i
shall
upset
it
i
think
we
might
make
a
short
cut
suggested
linda
instead
of
walking
all
round
the
drive
and
the
avenue
we
go
straight
through
the
shrubbery
it
will
take
off
an
enormous
corner
and
save
us
the
hill
by
the
rosery
we
not
supposed
to
go
there
but
no
one
will
notice
they
plunged
therefore
under
the
trees
wheeling
the
little
barrow
with
some
difficulty
over
the
grass
and
among
the
rhododendrons
and
were
just
getting
in
sight
of
the
lawn
when
linda
suddenly
stopped
and
clutched
sylvia
by
the
arm
look
she
cried
there
sadie
thompson
coming
with
gertie
warburton
what
will
she
say
when
she
finds
we
taken
french
leave
with
her
barrow
she
be
ever
so
cross
give
it
me
quick
and
rush
over
here
amongst
the
bushes
perhaps
they
wo
see
us
she
seized
the
handles
from
sylvia
grasp
and
they
scuttled
as
fast
as
they
could
under
the
boughs
of
a
particularly
big
rhododendron
which
appeared
to
offer
a
safe
retreat
quick
quick
they
looking
cried
linda
bending
low
to
avoid
the
branches
and
scrambling
farther
under
the
bush
hullo
why
oh
i
say
what
happened
she
might
well
exclaim
for
to
her
extreme
astonishment
the
wheelbarrow
suddenly
seemed
to
plunge
into
the
ground
and
she
saw
before
her
nothing
but
the
tips
of
the
handles
standing
out
from
among
a
quantity
of
dead
and
withered
leaves
how
very
peculiar
she
said
there
must
be
a
hole
here
why
it
a
sort
of
pool
i
believe
look
it
all
horrid
black
mud
and
water
under
the
dead
leaves
what
a
disgusting
mess
the
barrow
is
in
how
are
we
to
get
it
out
we
lost
all
our
stones
said
sylvia
kneeling
at
the
edge
and
breaking
off
a
stick
to
poke
into
the
muddy
depths
below
what
a
queer
place
it
is
i
do
mind
the
stones
because
we
can
find
some
more
but
i
do
mind
the
barrow
even
if
we
fish
it
out
how
are
we
ever
to
wash
it
sadie
will
be
most
dreadfully
angry
and
we
shall
get
into
such
a
scrape
we
are
really
allowed
to
borrow
each
other
things
without
asking
and
if
sadie
turns
nasty
and
tells
and
miss
kaye
hears
about
it
i
do
know
what
may
happen
ca
we
pull
it
out
and
take
it
to
the
back
drive
again
and
bring
a
watering
can
to
wash
it
with
said
sylvia
we
might
but
it
so
hard
to
get
it
when
i
tug
it
only
seems
to
flop
in
deeper
let
me
try
you
can
if
you
like
but
i
think
the
stones
are
weighing
it
down
you
go
a
little
farther
on
then
and
let
me
come
to
where
you
are
so
that
i
can
reach
properly
linda
crawled
cautiously
along
feeling
her
way
as
she
went
it
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
sunk
tub
she
said
look
the
edges
are
made
of
wood
and
it
filled
up
with
water
oh
do
be
careful
sylvia
she
exclaimed
as
the
latter
leaned
over
to
grasp
the
handles
i
all
right
i
got
them
quite
firmly
now
i
going
to
give
one
good
tug
and
a
shake
to
get
rid
of
the
stones
and
then
i
expect
it
will
come
shall
i
hold
your
dress
asked
linda
looking
on
with
a
shiver
of
apprehension
no
do
touch
me
there
i
can
feel
the
stones
go
it
coming
it
coming
and
so
it
was
but
far
more
suddenly
than
sylvia
had
calculated
the
unexpected
jerk
completely
overbalanced
her
and
before
she
had
time
even
to
clutch
at
one
of
the
rhododendron
boughs
she
had
fallen
together
with
the
barrow
into
the
pool
luckily
it
was
not
deep
and
she
was
in
no
danger
of
drowning
but
the
mud
was
thick
and
black
at
the
bottom
and
as
she
scrambled
hastily
out
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
dipped
into
an
inkpot
oh
sylvia
cried
linda
what
are
we
to
do
we
ca
possibly
help
everyone
finding
out
now
what
a
frightful
mess
you
in
so
i
am
said
sylvia
looking
ruefully
at
her
spoilt
clothes
and
trying
to
wipe
off
some
of
the
mud
with
her
hands
i
did
get
the
barrow
up
either
oh
never
mind
the
barrow
we
ca
stop
for
it
now
there
the
dressing
bell
we
shall
have
to
go
and
tell
somebody
you
simply
streaming
with
mud
and
we
shall
both
be
late
for
dinner
feeling
very
guilty
the
pair
crept
out
from
under
the
bush
and
tried
to
dash
across
towards
the
side
door
on
the
chance
that
sylvia
might
be
able
to
reach
the
bathroom
and
remove
at
least
some
of
the
traces
of
her
dipping
before
anyone
caught
her
it
was
a
vain
hope
for
in
turning
the
corner
they
ran
almost
into
the
arms
of
miss
coleman
who
had
come
out
to
look
for
a
missing
member
of
her
small
flock
sylvia
lindsay
she
cried
in
horror
you
naughty
child
where
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
i
do
know
replied
sylvia
dissolving
into
tears
which
made
white
trickles
down
her
dirty
cheeks
like
little
rivers
on
a
map
i
fell
in
somewhere
and
it
was
all
mud
and
it
cold
and
please
may
i
go
in
and
change
my
things
come
with
me
to
the
bathroom
this
minute
said
miss
coleman
abandoning
her
search
for
dolly
camden
and
hustling
sylvia
before
her
with
much
indignation
linda
go
and
tidy
yourself
miss
kaye
will
have
to
hear
of
this
it
is
a
very
bad
beginning
sylvia
for
your
first
day
sylvia
was
soaked
to
the
skin
and
was
obliged
to
take
a
hot
bath
and
put
on
a
whole
fresh
set
of
clothes
while
miss
coleman
stood
grimly
by
and
asked
questions
till
she
had
drawn
all
the
facts
of
the
story
they
were
so
late
for
dinner
that
they
only
arrived
in
the
at
the
pudding
course
and
miss
coleman
after
a
few
quiet
words
of
explanation
to
miss
kaye
made
sylvia
sit
with
her
at
a
small
side
table
instead
of
going
to
their
proper
places
miss
kaye
glanced
at
sylvia
but
made
no
remark
and
one
of
the
servants
brought
their
plates
of
meat
and
vegetables
they
were
and
sylvia
could
not
enjoy
anything
when
she
thought
of
the
scolding
that
was
to
follow
she
caught
linda
eye
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
did
not
dare
to
turn
again
in
that
direction
because
miss
coleman
was
looking
at
her
she
knew
so
little
of
school
life
that
she
had
no
idea
what
punishment
would
be
inflicted
for
such
crimes
as
borrowing
a
barrow
without
leave
and
tumbling
into
a
tub
full
of
muddy
water
in
none
of
the
books
she
had
read
did
the
girls
do
any
such
things
they
generally
cheat
at
lessons
or
read
the
examination
questions
beforehand
or
copy
each
other
essays
thought
sylvia
and
this
is
quite
different
even
sara
crewe
never
fell
into
a
tub
nor
any
of
the
girls
in
i
wonder
what
miss
kaye
will
say
miss
kaye
lingered
over
pudding
evidently
with
the
intention
of
allowing
the
latecomers
a
few
extra
minutes
then
rising
and
saying
grace
she
announced
linda
marshall
and
sylvia
lindsay
will
come
to
my
study
at
a
quarter
to
two
and
left
the
room
we
in
for
it
now
said
linda
clasping
sylvia
by
the
hand
as
they
met
in
the
passage
oh
why
did
we
ever
get
those
wretched
stones
and
we
left
the
barrow
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
we
shall
have
to
tell
about
that
was
miss
coleman
very
cross
she
was
rather
she
kept
hurrying
me
on
and
saying
quick
all
the
time
you
ca
think
how
terribly
the
mud
stuck
i
had
even
to
wash
part
of
my
hair
it
not
dry
yet
let
us
go
into
the
classroom
i
do
want
to
meet
sadie
i
afraid
she
ask
about
it
it
nearly
a
quarter
to
two
now
i
beginning
to
shake
in
my
shoes
it
took
a
good
deal
of
screwing
up
of
courage
before
the
two
culprits
ventured
to
give
a
faltering
tap
at
the
door
of
the
study
come
in
said
miss
kaye
brisk
voice
the
children
looked
at
each
other
and
entered
with
much
the
same
feeling
as
they
would
have
experienced
at
a
visit
to
the
dentist
miss
kaye
was
seated
at
her
desk
which
was
covered
with
papers
and
merely
glancing
up
for
an
instant
said
i
am
busy
so
sit
down
till
i
have
leisure
to
attend
to
you
and
taking
no
further
notice
of
them
went
on
with
her
writing
linda
stole
quietly
to
the
sofa
and
sylvia
sank
on
to
the
nearest
chair
where
she
sat
very
still
looking
with
eager
eyes
round
the
prettily
furnished
room
she
had
a
warm
appreciation
for
artistic
things
and
she
gazed
with
delight
at
the
beautiful
burne
jones
engravings
the
old
oak
cupboard
with
its
blue
china
the
silver
bowl
of
roses
on
the
side
table
and
the
bookcase
full
of
richly
bound
volumes
miss
kaye
herself
she
thought
made
part
of
the
picture
she
liked
her
brown
eyes
her
clear
fresh
complexion
and
her
abundant
auburn
hair
she
reflected
sylvia
not
at
all
horrid
and
old
and
sour
i
dare
say
she
could
be
rather
stern
yet
she
looks
as
if
she
could
laugh
too
i
like
her
eyes
they
are
so
dark
and
quick
and
shining
they
seem
to
take
one
all
in
at
once
i
wonder
if
she
going
to
be
very
angry
miss
kaye
looked
up
just
at
that
moment
and
met
sylvia
gaze
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
but
seeing
the
child
flush
scarlet
she
folded
her
letter
placed
it
in
the
envelope
and
stamped
it
then
ringing
the
bell
handed
it
to
a
servant
and
told
her
to
take
it
at
once
to
the
pillar
box
in
time
for
the
afternoon
post
now
i
am
ready
she
said
turning
at
last
to
her
little
pupils
linda
and
sylvia
you
have
been
in
trouble
and
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
yourselves
what
has
occurred
it
was
hard
to
begin
since
everyone
had
a
natural
awe
of
the
headmistress
but
once
the
plunge
was
made
they
found
themselves
relating
their
tale
fairly
connectedly
with
the
help
of
a
few
questions
miss
kaye
listened
gravely
this
is
what
comes
of
borrowing
without
leave
and
going
where
you
are
forbidden
she
said
the
tub
is
used
by
the
gardener
for
storing
water
and
no
doubt
with
the
rainy
days
we
had
in
september
it
has
accumulated
a
good
deal
of
mud
as
well
i
will
take
care
that
the
wheelbarrow
is
recovered
and
washed
and
i
shall
expect
you
both
to
apologize
to
sadie
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
the
school
that
the
girls
should
respect
each
other
property
you
may
go
now
but
do
not
let
this
happen
again
rejoiced
to
escape
so
easily
the
children
fled
eager
to
describe
their
adventure
to
the
rest
of
the
class
who
were
brimming
over
with
curiosity
after
the
hurried
account
which
had
been
whispered
by
linda
at
dinner
and
passed
on
by
the
next
girl
with
so
many
variations
that
the
general
version
was
that
sylvia
had
taken
a
ride
in
the
barrow
and
fallen
down
a
well
there
was
scarcely
any
time
before
afternoon
school
but
they
managed
to
give
a
proper
explanation
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
telling
and
the
effect
it
produced
marian
woodhouse
might
turn
up
her
nose
and
call
them
babies
but
she
listened
all
the
same
and
sylvia
could
not
help
thinking
was
just
a
little
jealous
to
find
them
the
centre
of
so
much
interest
illustration
sylvia
wrote
her
first
letter
home
that
evening
sylvia
wrote
her
first
letter
home
that
evening
after
tea
and
found
she
had
such
an
amount
to
put
in
it
she
hardly
knew
how
to
begin

your
loving
daughter
sylvia
chapter
v
rivals
sylvia
quickly
discovered
that
life
at
school
was
a
totally
different
affair
from
what
it
had
been
at
home
she
had
now
very
little
opportunity
of
ever
being
alone
the
solitary
readings
and
pretendings
with
which
she
had
been
wont
to
amuse
herself
were
impossible
for
every
hour
of
the
day
seemed
so
well
filled
with
work
walks
and
games
and
even
in
recreation
time
the
other
girls
constantly
claimed
her
attention
by
the
end
of
a
week
she
had
already
learnt
several
very
necessary
facts
that
orders
had
to
be
promptly
obeyed
without
either
dawdling
or
arguing
that
strict
punctuality
was
the
rule
and
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
be
even
a
minute
late
for
classes
or
meals
that
she
was
by
no
means
the
only
important
person
in
the
school
because
everybody
else
thought
herself
of
quite
as
much
consequence
and
some
rather
more
so
that
schoolgirls
had
scant
sympathy
for
bumps
bruises
tears
headaches
or
any
other
minor
woes
and
only
said
you
baby
if
she
complained
and
lastly
that
though
it
seemed
most
peculiar
to
have
no
one
to
make
a
special
fuss
over
her
on
the
whole
there
was
so
much
fun
going
on
that
it
was
a
great
deal
more
interesting
than
doing
lessons
by
herself
with
miss
holt
the
girls
of
the
third
class
all
of
whom
could
write
their
ages
with
two
figures
felt
themselves
very
superior
and
in
comparison
with
the
little
ones
in
the
kindergarten
there
were
seven
of
these
children
whose
ages
ranged
from
six
to
nine
and
as
they
shared
the
playroom
with
the
third
form
it
was
the
fashion
to
pet
them
and
take
notice
of
them
dolly
camden
connie
younger
sister
was
a
merry
little
soul
with
the
family
failing
for
continually
getting
into
mischief
and
was
the
chief
anxiety
of
miss
coleman
life
having
a
capacity
for
spilling
water
inking
her
fingers
tearing
her
clothes
and
losing
her
books
unequalled
by
anyone
else
in
her
division
the
camdens
were
all
handfuls
even
rosie
who
was
sixteen
and
might
have
been
chosen
a
monitress
if
she
had
been
more
sedate
and
stella
who
enlivened
the
second
class
with
practical
jokes
there
was
a
story
in
the
school
that
miss
kaye
had
once
written
to
camden
to
say
that
rosie
was
unmanageable
and
that
camden
had
written
back
to
say
that
she
was
very
sorry
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
manage
any
of
her
daughters
herself
and
would
miss
kaye
please
try
again
whether
this
were
true
or
false
miss
kaye
proved
capable
of
keeping
the
unruly
four
in
order
and
was
about
the
only
person
except
their
father
of
whom
they
really
stood
in
awe
sadie
and
elsie
thompson
were
two
puny
motherless
little
girls
of
nine
and
six
they
had
been
brought
up
by
an
aunt
who
was
not
at
all
kind
to
them
and
they
found
heathercliffe
house
such
a
happy
exchange
that
they
almost
dreaded
the
holidays
when
they
must
go
back
to
the
home
that
was
so
unhomelike
their
father
was
a
who
came
to
visit
them
about
twice
a
year
when
he
returned
from
his
voyages
and
brought
them
presents
from
foreign
places
he
did
not
forget
them
either
when
he
was
away
and
often
sent
them
postcards
of
strange
countries
which
had
to
travel
many
thousand
miles
before
they
reached
england
margie
wilson
was
a
fat
sturdy
child
with
an
original
mind
and
a
stubborn
temper
she
had
a
habit
of
speaking
her
thoughts
which
was
apt
to
be
rather
disconcerting
on
the
first
morning
after
her
arrival
may
spencer
who
was
monitress
on
her
landing
went
into
her
bedroom
and
told
her
it
was
time
to
get
up
margie
raised
herself
slowly
in
bed
with
the
clothes
drawn
round
her
neck
and
fixed
her
black
eyes
on
the
intruder
what
your
name
she
enquired
briefly
may
spencer
oh
i
do
like
you
may
spencer
you
got
a
snub
nose
i
get
up
and
with
that
she
retired
under
the
bedclothes
and
absolutely
refused
to
stir
until
poor
may
had
to
fetch
miss
coleman
to
enforce
discipline
and
uphold
her
authority
edna
lowe
was
a
rather
silly
little
thing
who
had
been
much
spoilt
at
home
and
was
still
surreptitiously
petted
by
her
sister
lily
in
the
second
class
who
occasionally
had
a
battle
on
her
behalf
with
miss
coleman
who
saw
no
reason
why
edna
should
be
treated
differently
from
the
others
and
rewarded
good
behaviour
or
inflicted
punishments
with
an
impartial
hand
nessie
hirst
a
nervous
child
who
had
been
sent
to
aberglyn
for
the
benefit
of
the
sea
air
was
a
favourite
with
the
third
class
her
pathetic
wistful
grey
eyes
long
hair
and
the
beautiful
and
elaborately
embroidered
frocks
which
her
mother
worked
for
her
gave
her
a
somewhat
distinguished
appearance
and
among
the
girls
she
often
went
by
the
nickname
of
little
vere
de
vere
the
prettiest
of
all
however
was
greta
collins
a
small
rascal
who
attached
herself
promptly
to
sylvia
like
a
limpet
sitting
on
her
knee
clinging
round
her
neck
with
kittenish
fondness
and
making
herself
very
charming
with
her
coaxing
manner
it
only
because
you
somebody
fresh
said
marian
woodhouse
she
does
this
to
every
new
girl
you
should
have
seen
the
fuss
she
made
of
me
when
first
i
came
she
have
quite
got
over
it
in
a
fortnight
and
will
hardly
look
at
you
you
wo
will
you
darling
said
sylvia
indignantly
hugging
the
child
closer
for
she
was
much
flattered
at
being
the
object
of
so
much
adoration
no
i
love
you
always
better
than
any
of
these
horrid
girls
tell
them
to
go
away
i
do
want
anybody
but
you
and
she
clasped
her
arms
round
sylvia
neck
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
i
know
you
will
declared
sylvia
so
we
just
take
no
notice
of
them
you
my
special
baby
and
i
mean
to
keep
you
all
right
you
soon
find
out
and
then
do
say
i
did
warn
you
returned
marian
laughing
in
spite
of
both
sylvia
and
greta
protestations
to
the
contrary
marian
words
proved
to
be
exactly
true
for
almost
a
week
the
little
girl
affection
kept
at
red
heat
on
the
seventh
day
it
began
to
show
signs
of
flagging
it
was
in
vain
that
sylvia
tempted
her
with
stories
cajoled
her
with
sweets
or
even
presented
her
with
one
of
her
lovely
new
paintbrushes
greta
was
tired
of
her
fancy
and
though
she
accepted
anything
that
was
offered
her
she
only
gave
a
peck
of
a
kiss
in
return
and
ran
back
promptly
to
play
with
nessie
hirst
poor
sylvia
was
terribly
distressed
she
had
been
fascinated
with
greta
pretty
face
and
big
blue
eyes
she
liked
to
curl
the
long
golden
ringlets
round
her
fingers
to
fasten
the
clean
pinafores
or
do
any
other
small
services
for
her
and
especially
to
feel
that
the
child
clung
to
her
in
preference
to
anybody
else
to
be
thus
suddenly
deserted
was
a
blow
and
it
was
particularly
galling
to
have
marian
woodhouse
say
i
told
you
so
all
her
efforts
at
winning
back
her
fickle
admirer
were
absolutely
useless
greta
refused
to
be
coaxed
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
fulfilled
marian
prophecy
by
pushing
away
her
former
friend
and
even
smacking
her
which
brought
matters
to
such
a
crisis
that
sylvia
after
a
storm
of
tears
in
private
gave
up
the
attempt
and
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
luckily
there
were
plenty
of
fresh
interests
to
help
to
put
greta
out
of
her
thoughts
though
she
had
studied
fairly
hard
with
her
governess
at
home
she
had
never
before
entered
into
competition
with
other
girls
and
it
was
a
new
experience
to
work
in
class
as
miss
holt
had
expected
she
was
forward
in
some
subjects
and
backward
in
others
but
she
was
gifted
with
an
excellent
memory
and
found
she
could
learn
with
little
trouble
what
many
of
the
others
found
impossible
tasks
except
for
french
with
mademoiselle
and
nature
study
with
miss
kaye
all
the
lessons
were
taken
by
miss
arkwright
sylvia
could
never
quite
make
up
her
mind
whether
she
liked
her
or
not
she
was
tall
and
slim
with
large
teeth
and
a
nose
that
moved
about
like
a
rabbit
when
she
spoke
and
she
wore
her
hair
brushed
very
plainly
back
from
her
high
forehead
she
was
a
conscientious
teacher
but
not
a
very
interesting
one
and
she
somehow
lacked
the
charm
which
attracted
the
girls
so
much
to
their
headmistress
miss
kaye
seems
to
like
to
know
each
one
of
us
separately
and
all
about
our
friends
and
our
homes
said
marian
one
day
and
i
believe
miss
arkwright
cares
in
the
least
about
us
out
of
school
so
long
as
we
know
our
lessons
in
class
children
are
very
quick
to
feel
sympathy
and
though
miss
arkwright
did
her
duty
thoroughly
most
of
her
pupils
respected
her
more
than
they
loved
her
and
while
she
was
not
disliked
she
was
never
popular
it
was
a
revelation
to
sylvia
who
in
her
work
with
miss
holt
had
never
troubled
whether
she
did
exceedingly
or
only
moderately
well
to
find
that
at
heathercliffe
house
a
little
extra
effort
made
all
the
difference
at
the
end
of
every
week
the
marks
of
each
girl
were
balanced
up
and
on
monday
morning
at
nine
miss
kaye
would
march
into
the
classroom
to
read
out
the
list
and
add
a
few
comments
of
praise
or
blame
the
girls
sat
in
school
for
the
week
according
to
the
order
in
which
their
names
occurred
on
the
balancing
list
and
it
had
been
a
point
of
great
pride
with
marian
woodhouse
to
come
out
top
a
position
which
hitherto
no
one
had
troubled
to
dispute
with
her
sylvia
had
arrived
on
a
wednesday
so
that
the
first
week
she
was
only
able
to
obtain
part
marks
though
in
two
days
she
had
gained
enough
to
place
her
up
the
class
above
gwennie
woodhouse
and
jessie
ellis
and
even
nina
forster
the
second
week
was
a
duel
between
herself
and
marian
both
worked
hard
and
steadily
and
seemed
fairly
equal
for
what
sylvia
lost
by
her
bad
writing
she
gained
through
her
more
accurate
memory
and
some
of
marian
most
venturesome
guesses
happened
to
turn
out
wrong
though
she
could
beat
sylvia
at
arithmetic
the
books
in
which
they
wrote
their
exercises
were
always
looked
over
on
saturday
by
miss
kaye
who
marked
them
both
for
matter
style
writing
and
general
neatness
so
the
girls
could
not
tell
until
these
were
returned
what
was
their
total
for
the
week
it
was
very
exciting
on
sylvia
second
monday
morning
when
miss
kaye
entered
bearing
the
pile
of
exercises
and
prepared
to
read
out
the
list
of
marks
it
was
her
custom
always
to
begin
with
the
bottom
girl
and
she
proceeded
as
usual
your
history
is
especially
weak
and
i
noticed
there
were
sixteen
mistakes
in
your
dictation
if
you
can
not
keep
up
with
the
class
i
shall
be
obliged
to
send
you
down
again
i
believe
you
have
tried
gwennie
as
it
is
more
than
last
week
but
there
is
still
much
room
for
improvement
i
expect
better
things
from
you
connie
you
can
learn
quite
well
when
you
apply
yourself
properly
and
i
consider
it
a
disgrace
that
you
should
have
a
bad
mark
for
arithmetic
if
i
find
it
again
you
will
have
to
stay
in
on
saturday
afternoon
and
learn
your
tables
you
have
had
a
bad
cold
so
i
will
excuse
you
this
week
your
writing
is
beautifully
neat
though
i
should
like
to
see
higher
marks
you
have
done
well
in
grammar
but
failed
utterly
in
geography
your
map
is
very
inaccurate
excellent
in
spelling
and
composition
but
rather
weak
in
arithmetic
very
good
and
conscientious
work
your
exercises
show
great
care
and
neatness
i
am
pleased
sylvia
to
find
you
have
done
so
well
and
hope
you
will
continue
with
such
a
good
record
i
should
like
to
see
improvement
in
your
writing
and
you
must
make
that
your
chief
care
in
every
other
respect
your
work
is
highly
satisfactory
girls
take
your
places
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
sylvia
when
she
stepped
above
marian
woodhouse
to
claim
her
seat
at
the
top
of
the
class
marian
held
her
head
down
and
looked
as
black
as
thunder
linda
could
scarcely
conceal
her
delight
connie
camden
was
nudging
nina
forster
and
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
sight
of
her
sister
humiliation
she
had
no
ambition
for
herself
but
she
had
always
gloried
in
success
it
a
shame
she
whispered
to
jessie
ellis
that
new
girl
has
no
right
to
get
top
i
sure
miss
arkwright
must
have
favoured
her
miss
arkwright
looked
as
surprised
as
anybody
but
her
conscience
was
clear
of
all
favouritism
she
was
strictly
impartial
and
miss
kaye
herself
had
marked
the
exercises
she
made
no
comment
however
and
lessons
began
as
usual
the
eight
girls
were
seated
in
a
row
on
a
form
opposite
their
teacher
desk
and
were
expected
to
sit
with
shoulders
erect
hands
folded
and
feet
neatly
placed
together
sylvia
who
had
rather
fidgety
ways
and
was
apt
to
wriggle
when
answering
a
question
found
it
hard
to
keep
this
prim
position
and
in
the
agony
of
recalling
the
principal
tributaries
of
the
yorkshire
ouse
she
almost
unconsciously
seized
a
handful
of
pens
from
the
box
which
lay
on
a
chair
by
her
side
and
began
to
finger
them
nervously
the
swale
the
yore
the
nidd
the
wharfe
the
aire
she
said
counting
each
with
a
pen
marian
put
out
her
hand
and
drew
the
pens
firmly
away
two
more
suggested
miss
arkwright
the
swale
the
yore
the
nidd
the
wharfe
the
aire
repeated
sylvia
desperately
missing
the
pens
and
feeling
as
if
she
could
not
go
on
without
them
next
said
miss
arkwright
who
never
waited
long
for
anybody
calder
and
don
finished
marian
promptly
replacing
the
pens
in
the
box
which
she
popped
on
to
the
desk
behind
whispering
to
sylvia
as
she
did
so
you
not
fit
to
be
top
marian
woodhouse
and
sylvia
lindsay
each
lose
an
order
mark
said
miss
arkwright
at
which
they
both
looked
sober
though
neither
minded
very
much
since
the
other
had
the
same
you
need
have
pulled
the
pens
from
me
just
when
i
was
answering
said
sylvia
to
marian
afterwards
you
put
everything
straight
out
of
my
head
if
you
ca
answer
without
something
to
play
with
retorted
marian
you
better
go
to
the
baby
class
and
learn
kindergarten
drawing
on
a
slate
no
one
would
think
you
were
nearly
eleven
it
was
certainly
trying
for
poor
marian
to
find
a
younger
girl
occupying
the
position
which
she
had
come
to
regard
as
her
own
special
property
and
she
could
not
yield
with
a
good
grace
fate
seemed
determined
to
call
her
failure
into
notice
in
the
afternoon
when
singing
was
over
miss
denby
turned
to
dismiss
the
various
forms
back
to
their
schoolrooms
class
three
will
go
out
first
she
said
balancing
order
now
girls
be
quick
come
marian
where
are
you
for
marian
with
a
very
red
face
had
not
stepped
forward
as
usual
to
take
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
line
i
top
said
sylvia
who
found
it
impossible
to
conceal
her
triumph
and
she
led
the
way
with
the
feeling
of
a
rival
claimant
who
has
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
been
raised
to
the
throne
enjoying
miss
denby
astonishment
as
much
as
marian
confusion
after
that
it
was
a
continual
struggle
between
the
two
children
for
the
coveted
seat
sometimes
one
gained
it
and
sometimes
the
other
and
one
week
they
were
exactly
equal
a
difficulty
which
miss
kaye
solved
by
deciding
that
marian
was
to
be
head
in
the
mornings
and
sylvia
in
the
afternoons
no
one
else
in
the
class
seemed
able
to
dispute
it
with
them
though
hazel
prestbury
occasionally
won
high
marks
linda
a
bright
enough
child
to
talk
to
and
fond
of
reading
had
not
a
very
good
memory
connie
camden
was
incorrigibly
lazy
nina
only
worked
by
fits
and
starts
and
both
gwennie
woodhouse
and
jessie
ellis
were
of
course
out
of
the
question
sylvia
certainly
did
not
find
school
life
all
plain
sailing
among
other
things
miss
arkwright
was
a
totally
different
person
from
her
former
governess
miss
holt
anxious
to
develop
her
pupil
powers
of
general
intelligence
had
allowed
her
to
ask
continual
questions
and
would
even
argue
a
point
with
her
in
order
to
encourage
her
to
think
clearly
upon
a
subject
miss
arkwright
on
the
contrary
did
not
allow
any
girl
to
have
opinions
in
opposition
to
her
own
and
sylvia
got
into
sad
trouble
if
she
ventured
on
original
ideas
once
in
the
geography
class
she
was
asked
to
give
the
capital
of
tuscany
firenze
she
replied
promptly
next
said
miss
arkwright
florence
answered
marian
with
a
toss
of
her
head
firenze
is
the
proper
italian
name
for
florence
corrected
sylvia
father
and
mother
were
staying
there
last
easter
and
they
said
everybody
called
it
that
and
did
understand
what
you
meant
if
you
said
florence
we
are
having
our
geography
lesson
in
english
not
italian
so
we
will
call
the
places
by
the
english
names
which
are
given
in
the
book
said
miss
arkwright
glaring
at
her
and
sylvia
lost
a
mark
much
to
her
indignation
another
time
the
class
was
reading
and
repeating
the
notes
which
were
given
at
the
end
of
the
cantos
now
sylvia
had
revelled
in
so
many
historical
stories
that
she
understood
thoroughly
all
about
a
portcullis
and
a
drawbridge
and
a
donjon
keep
and
instead
of
simply
saying
the
note
she
volunteered
an
explanation
of
her
own
it
was
what
miss
holt
would
have
encouraged
but
miss
arkwright
kept
strictly
to
the
lesson
i
did
not
ask
for
your
opinion
sylvia
she
said
the
notes
given
in
the
book
are
quite
sufficient
and
you
may
confine
yourself
to
them
on
the
whole
miss
arkwright
was
fair
but
on
one
occasion
sylvia
felt
herself
really
to
be
the
object
of
a
great
injustice
a
very
difficult
grammar
lesson
was
in
progress
which
most
of
the
girls
found
extremely
hard
to
understand
miss
arkwright
had
asked
many
questions
round
the
class
and
now
addressed
one
to
sylvia
who
was
top
she
missed
and
the
teacher
turned
to
marian
who
sat
next
just
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
and
without
waiting
for
marian
reply
miss
arkwright
closed
her
book
and
opened
the
register
now
that
last
wrong
answer
had
given
sylvia
a
bad
mark
and
she
felt
it
was
not
just
that
she
should
have
had
one
more
question
than
any
of
the
other
girls
i
do
believe
one
of
them
knew
it
she
said
to
herself
and
if
the
question
had
gone
on
they
would
all
have
missed
too
oh
miss
arkwright
it
not
fair
she
added
aloud
getting
up
with
flaming
cheeks
at
the
sting
of
the
thought
that
half
a
minute
had
saved
marian
mark
and
lost
her
own
i
ought
to
count
that
last
miss
sylvia
if
you
speak
to
me
like
that
again
i
shall
order
you
to
leave
the
room
said
the
mistress
who
prided
herself
on
her
good
discipline
i
think
you
must
have
forgotten
yourself
it
was
mean
of
her
said
linda
trying
to
console
her
friend
afterwards
when
we
were
in
miss
coleman
form
and
the
bell
rang
when
a
question
was
only
halfway
down
the
class
she
always
said
do
count
the
last
turn
because
it
was
fair
unless
we
all
had
the
same
chance
of
missing
but
you
did
say
it
in
such
a
cheeky
way
i
think
that
was
why
she
was
so
angry
it
no
use
trying
to
get
her
to
take
it
off
now
when
she
once
said
a
thing
she
sticks
to
it
and
nobody
but
miss
kaye
could
make
her
alter
it
and
we
should
dare
to
ask
her
and
if
we
did
it
would
be
worth
it
because
miss
arkwright
would
be
twice
as
cross
afterwards
you
just
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
chapter
vi
squabbles
by
the
time
sylvia
was
thoroughly
settled
in
the
third
class
another
trouble
began
to
distress
her
she
had
formed
a
great
affection
for
linda
marshall
and
as
the
two
shared
a
bedroom
it
seemed
only
natural
that
they
should
be
bosom
friends
linda
was
very
willing
to
consider
sylvia
as
her
special
comrade
they
were
almost
the
same
age
and
had
so
many
likes
and
dislikes
in
common
that
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
to
quarrel
over
anything
and
they
were
never
so
happy
as
when
they
were
alone
together
that
however
hazel
prestbury
was
by
no
means
ready
to
allow
although
she
slept
with
connie
camden
she
had
hitherto
considered
linda
her
friend
and
was
very
indignant
that
sylvia
should
have
stepped
between
them
hazel
was
a
girl
about
whom
miss
kaye
often
felt
some
uneasiness
the
eldest
in
her
class
she
was
also
old
for
her
age
and
she
had
brought
a
good
many
notions
to
school
with
her
that
were
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
the
simple
ideas
which
were
encouraged
at
heathercliffe
house
she
thought
far
more
of
dress
and
position
than
she
had
any
business
to
do
criticized
the
other
girls
clothing
compared
the
value
of
her
birthday
presents
with
those
of
her
schoolmates
and
was
apt
to
boast
of
her
abundant
pocket
money
she
was
also
not
always
as
open
and
truthful
as
might
have
been
wished
and
though
it
could
never
be
exactly
defined
she
somehow
kept
up
a
slight
spirit
of
hostility
against
the
mistresses
and
would
never
respond
heartily
to
any
kindness
from
headquarters
miss
kaye
thought
she
was
not
altogether
a
wise
friend
for
linda
who
being
a
whole
year
younger
was
likely
to
be
easily
influenced
and
it
was
on
this
account
that
she
had
not
allowed
the
two
to
share
a
bedroom
linda
was
an
affectionate
little
girl
she
did
not
notice
the
faults
in
hazel
character
and
would
have
been
delighted
to
include
both
her
companions
in
a
triple
friendship
but
that
did
not
content
either
and
though
sylvia
had
the
advantage
at
morning
and
evening
hazel
generally
triumphed
during
the
day
sylvia
would
watch
with
jealous
eyes
as
the
pair
walked
arm
in
arm
down
the
avenue
or
played
draughts
together
in
the
recreation
hour
she
tried
to
console
herself
with
reading
but
somehow
the
books
did
not
seem
nearly
so
absorbing
as
they
had
done
at
home
and
she
sat
with
one
ear
open
to
hear
what
linda
was
saying
she
did
not
care
to
make
friends
with
any
of
the
other
girls
though
nina
forster
proffered
a
few
advances
and
connie
camden
was
always
hail
fellow
well
met
with
everybody
one
wet
afternoon
the
third
class
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
fourth
were
sitting
round
the
playroom
fire
indulging
in
oranges
which
miss
kaye
had
given
as
a
special
treat
i
like
to
suck
mine
with
a
lump
of
sugar
said
gwennie
if
you
do
it
carefully
you
can
get
every
scrap
of
orange
out
without
breaking
the
peel
i
ca
eat
orangeth
sighed
sadie
thompson
pensively
they
alwayth
make
me
thick
make
you
thin
i
should
think
laughed
marian
you
the
skinniest
little
creature
i
ever
saw
i
do
mean
fat
i
mean
thick
oh
sick
then
why
do
you
say
so
becauthe
i
ca
help
lithping
replied
sadie
who
was
rather
proud
of
her
accomplishment
and
did
not
make
any
great
effort
to
overcome
it
i
wish
i
lisped
said
connie
camden
enviously
i
have
such
fun
with
miss
arkwright
in
the
reading
lesson
she
stop
for
five
minutes
worrying
over
one
word
do
you
remember
when
i
pretended
i
say
i
going
to
cut
my
orange
in
half
if
anybody
will
lend
me
a
penknife
where
your
own
lost
it
long
ago
i
never
can
keep
them
i
got
one
in
my
christmas
stocking
and
another
on
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
new
one
at
the
beginning
of
this
term
but
they
all
gone
my
pencil
wore
down
to
such
a
perfect
stump
yesterday
i
could
finish
my
sums
and
i
dare
borrow
because
miss
arkwright
said
she
give
a
mark
to
the
first
girl
who
spoke
one
word
i
tried
to
signal
to
nina
but
she
would
look
hazel
lend
me
yours
no
thanks
replied
hazel
not
to
cut
oranges
it
a
new
one
and
you
spoil
it
oh
you
mean
thing
who
be
generous
you
may
have
this
if
you
like
said
sylvia
i
do
much
mind
if
you
keep
it
it
only
an
old
one
and
i
have
another
in
my
pencil
box
you
dear
i
love
it
i
shall
have
to
give
you
something
in
exchange
though
or
else
it
will
be
unlucky
what
will
you
have
and
connie
turned
out
the
very
miscellaneous
contents
of
her
pockets
displaying
various
stumps
of
lead
pencil
a
much
worn
indiarubber
a
buttonhook
two
or
three
dominoes
a
walnut
shell
some
acorn
cups
a
stone
with
a
hole
in
it
a
whistle
a
sticky
piece
of
toffee
and
a
calendar
i
do
want
any
of
them
said
sylvia
shaking
her
head
but
you
must
knives
cut
love
and
we
shall
quarrel
if
you
do
the
calendar
not
much
good
it
last
year
and
i
only
kept
it
for
the
picture
of
the
dog
on
the
back
but
have
this
pressing
one
of
the
pencils
into
her
hand
it
the
longest
piece
i
have
and
rather
a
nice
soft
one
let
us
try
putting
our
pips
in
the
fire
said
nina
you
name
one
after
yourself
and
another
after
someone
you
like
and
then
say
you
hate
me
pop
and
fly
if
you
love
me
burn
and
die
and
see
whether
you
and
the
person
you
have
chosen
will
stick
to
each
other
or
not
i
going
to
try
evelyn
hastings
is
she
your
latest
enquired
marian
i
think
she
perfectly
beautiful
she
let
me
carry
her
umbrella
for
her
this
morning
and
said
i
might
do
it
if
i
wanted
may
spencer
never
speaks
to
me
now
i
should
think
she
tired
of
you
you
must
have
been
such
a
nuisance
always
clinging
on
to
her
arm
why
ca
you
let
the
first
class
alone
they
do
want
us
they
may
want
you
but
they
want
me
said
nina
whose
adoration
of
the
big
girls
was
a
perpetual
joke
in
her
class
i
held
wool
yesterday
and
pulled
off
her
goloshes
and
she
never
even
asked
you
i
should
have
done
it
if
she
had
declared
marian
i
let
her
wait
on
herself
i
think
you
the
silliest
girl
i
know
put
your
wretched
pips
in
the
fire
if
you
going
to
the
result
was
unfortunate
the
one
christened
popped
away
promptly
much
to
its
owner
indignation
you
wo
stick
to
her
you
see
laughed
marian
you
get
tired
of
her
and
throw
her
over
as
you
do
everybody
else
the
amusement
proved
popular
and
all
the
girls
insisted
upon
trying
the
fortunes
of
themselves
and
their
friends
connie
camden
was
faithless
to
everybody
jessie
ellis
had
a
solitary
failure
but
would
not
divulge
the
name
she
had
chosen
or
make
another
attempt
and
gwennie
to
her
great
disgust
turned
traitor
to
her
beloved
marian
we
must
go
in
together
of
course
said
hazel
throwing
two
pips
for
herself
and
linda
into
the
flames
they
were
fat
juicy
ones
and
it
was
a
little
while
before
they
caught
fire
pop
pop
they
both
went
each
shooting
to
different
sides
of
the
grate
with
such
violence
that
they
fell
out
into
the
fender
they
have
finished
we
must
try
them
again
cried
hazel
stooping
over
the
guard
to
pick
them
up
no
no
exclaimed
the
others
they
flown
as
hard
as
any
could
fly
you
both
done
with
each
other
entirely
now
someone
else
linda
see
if
you
have
better
luck
with
sylvia
it
was
very
foolish
but
sylvia
looked
on
with
quite
a
feeling
of
anxiety
as
linda
dropped
two
carefully
chosen
pips
into
a
ruddy
hollow
among
the
coals
would
they
both
fly
apart
she
wondered
or
would
only
one
leave
the
other
and
if
so
which
or
would
they
linger
together
until
they
were
burnt
to
ashes
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
it
were
an
omen
of
their
friendship
they
burning
said
nina
one
just
going
to
pop
no
it
is
it
changed
its
mind
they
both
rolled
down
into
that
hot
piece
there
they
go
they
burnt
as
black
as
cinders
you
two
are
friends
you
the
only
ones
who
have
kept
together
of
all
we
tried
sylvia
squeezed
linda
hand
hard
with
pleasure
to
be
her
friend
and
stick
to
her
through
thick
and
thin
was
the
height
of
her
ambition
and
she
was
glad
that
their
trial
had
proved
so
favourable
it
a
silly
game
and
does
mean
anything
at
all
said
hazel
flushing
angrily
i
wonder
you
such
babies
as
to
believe
in
it
you
be
counting
your
fortunes
by
the
holes
in
your
biscuits
next
nina
you
were
a
goose
to
begin
it
well
really
you
were
ready
enough
to
try
said
nina
you
no
need
to
be
such
a
that
i
can
see
you
about
as
much
sense
as
a
sparrow
declared
hazel
and
never
have
any
more
if
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
sha
trouble
to
play
your
rubbishy
games
again
and
she
turned
away
to
get
out
her
writing
case
and
begin
a
home
letter
with
such
a
cross
expression
on
her
countenance
that
the
others
wisely
left
her
alone
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
that
an
incident
occurred
which
unfortunately
caused
the
first
shadow
of
a
quarrel
between
sylvia
and
her
friend
the
dancing
classes
had
commenced
and
were
held
weekly
in
the
large
schoolroom
at
two
everyone
was
expected
to
appear
in
a
light
frock
and
thin
shoes
so
the
afternoon
seemed
almost
more
like
a
party
than
a
lesson
miss
delaney
the
teacher
was
immensely
popular
with
the
girls
and
they
looked
forward
to
friday
throughout
the
whole
week
linda
who
was
particularly
graceful
and
light
of
foot
was
considered
one
of
the
best
dancers
in
the
school
and
always
included
in
a
tarantella
or
gavotte
or
any
figure
which
required
a
little
more
skill
than
was
possessed
by
most
of
the
beginners
linda
music
lesson
happened
to
be
on
friday
afternoon
at
two
and
she
went
straight
from
miss
denby
and
the
piano
to
the
dancing
class
now
on
this
particular
day
she
had
put
on
her
white
dress
as
usual
but
just
as
she
was
opening
the
door
of
the
she
suddenly
noticed
that
she
had
completely
forgotten
to
change
her
shoes
what
was
she
to
do
there
was
not
time
to
run
back
for
them
now
as
miss
denby
had
caught
sight
of
her
and
she
dare
not
beat
a
retreat
neither
could
she
go
after
her
lesson
because
the
girls
were
strictly
forbidden
upstairs
when
once
the
school
bell
had
rung
hazel
however
happened
to
be
passing
down
the
corridor
exactly
at
that
moment
and
linda
managed
to
find
time
to
gasp
out
ask
sylvia
to
bring
my
dancing
shoes
to
the
before
miss
denby
said
come
along
linda
what
are
you
waiting
for
and
she
was
obliged
to
enter
and
shut
the
door
hazel
was
in
no
hurry
to
deliver
her
message
she
waited
until
about
minutes
past
two
then
going
into
the
playroom
where
most
of
the
others
were
collected
she
strolled
leisurely
across
to
sylvia
here
you
she
said
insolently
you
got
to
go
and
fetch
dancing
shoes
she
forgotten
them
who
says
i
got
to
go
asked
sylvia
angrily
for
hazel
tone
had
roused
all
her
worst
feelings
i
do
for
one
then
i
just
sha
all
right
shall
i
tell
linda
you
said
you
would
you
can
if
you
like
i
sure
i
do
care
i
have
time
to
race
about
the
school
finding
other
people
things
it
almost
now
and
sylvia
marched
away
to
the
dancing
class
with
her
nose
in
the
air
as
much
out
of
temper
as
she
had
ever
felt
in
her
life
it
was
not
possible
for
hazel
or
anyone
else
to
fetch
the
shoes
as
the
rules
of
the
school
inflicted
dire
penalties
on
any
girl
who
entered
another
bedroom
so
when
linda
hurried
into
the
a
few
minutes
afterwards
expecting
to
be
able
to
put
them
on
she
was
much
disappointed
not
to
find
them
there
she
hunted
about
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
afraid
of
being
late
she
was
forced
to
go
to
the
lesson
in
her
ordinary
common
slippers
she
was
furious
since
the
whole
point
of
the
tarantella
lay
in
the
elegant
way
in
which
she
must
point
her
toes
and
turn
a
graceful
pirouette
and
how
was
she
to
do
so
in
these
thick
awkward
shoes
that
were
only
meant
for
the
hard
wear
and
tear
of
everyday
use
linda
was
rather
proud
of
her
dancing
and
it
was
very
annoying
to
have
her
best
steps
spoilt
for
lack
of
proper
slippers
she
could
not
venture
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
change
them
because
miss
kaye
was
sitting
in
the
room
and
would
be
sure
to
give
her
a
severe
scolding
for
her
carelessness
so
she
would
be
obliged
to
manage
as
best
she
could
and
hope
that
no
one
in
authority
would
notice
her
feet
did
you
give
sylvia
my
message
she
said
to
hazel
at
the
first
opportunity
when
the
three
girls
were
able
to
speak
together
during
a
rest
of
course
i
did
but
she
just
flatly
said
she
would
go
replied
hazel
delighted
to
have
this
opportunity
of
making
mischief
between
the
friends
did
you
really
sylvia
asked
linda
her
eyes
full
of
reproachful
enquiry
and
leaning
upon
hazel
arm
now
sylvia
was
still
not
at
all
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
and
the
sight
of
linda
head
pressed
against
hazel
shoulder
heaped
coals
on
to
her
wrath
i
had
time
she
snapped
and
turning
away
began
to
talk
to
nina
forster
at
this
point
the
mistress
called
for
the
tarantella
and
linda
stood
up
with
several
elder
girls
holding
her
tambourine
and
long
ribbons
gracefully
above
her
head
how
she
longed
for
the
dainty
bronze
shoes
that
were
left
in
the
bedroom
upstairs
her
steps
felt
so
awkward
that
she
could
neither
glide
nor
spring
properly
and
she
was
not
surprised
when
at
the
end
of
the
dance
miss
delaney
said
hardly
so
good
as
usual
my
dear
linda
considered
she
had
very
good
cause
to
feel
offended
with
sylvia
and
she
would
not
look
at
her
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
she
scarcely
touched
the
tips
of
her
fingers
when
they
met
in
the
grand
chain
and
kept
as
far
away
from
her
as
she
possibly
could
choosing
hazel
for
her
partner
in
the
waltz
and
connie
camden
in
the
highland
schottische
sylvia
tried
to
show
by
her
manner
that
she
did
not
care
but
in
reality
she
felt
on
the
verge
of
tears
she
danced
with
little
sadie
thompson
casting
a
wistful
look
every
now
and
then
at
linda
back
though
she
took
no
notice
if
they
happened
to
meet
face
to
face
she
managed
to
change
places
at
tea
and
sit
between
gwennie
woodhouse
and
jessie
ellis
and
at
evening
recreation
she
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
playroom
with
a
book
the
great
ordeal
was
when
the
two
children
found
themselves
alone
in
their
bedroom
at
night
each
considered
the
other
so
entirely
in
the
wrong
that
neither
would
give
way
and
they
both
undressed
in
stony
silence
very
different
indeed
from
the
confidences
which
they
were
accustomed
to
exchange
sylvia
peeped
at
linda
bed
in
the
morning
wondering
whether
she
would
show
any
signs
of
relenting
but
no
linda
got
up
without
noticing
her
in
the
least
and
the
breach
seemed
as
wide
as
ever
it
was
saturday
and
except
for
mending
and
stocking
darning
the
girls
might
amuse
themselves
as
they
wished
the
two
friends
had
planned
to
finish
their
garden
and
to
plant
the
delightful
collection
of
snowdrops
crocuses
and
tulips
which
lindsay
had
sent
them
sylvia
carried
the
box
down
and
a
trowel
and
set
to
work
in
a
manner
putting
in
little
groups
and
rows
though
she
certainly
was
not
enjoying
herself
linda
who
was
equally
unhappy
waited
ten
minutes
then
arriving
with
her
spade
began
solemnly
to
dig
up
her
root
of
hepatica
and
her
clump
of
primroses
do
you
want
to
put
them
here
enquired
sylvia
anxiously
moving
some
of
her
bulbs
out
of
the
way
no
thank
you
replied
linda
with
cold
politeness
i
going
back
to
my
old
garden
and
carrying
her
treasures
in
her
arms
she
stalked
away
poor
sylvia
felt
this
was
the
last
straw
to
be
thus
deserted
was
a
cruel
blow
she
would
never
enjoy
her
flowers
alone
however
lovely
they
might
prove
she
had
written
for
the
bulbs
chiefly
on
account
and
if
they
were
not
to
share
them
she
did
not
care
to
plant
them
at
all
she
flung
down
her
trowel
and
walking
away
to
a
retired
part
of
the
grounds
sat
down
on
a
seat
under
a
hawthorn
tree
and
began
to
cry
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
had
not
been
there
very
long
before
chance
or
something
better
than
chance
brought
mercy
ingledew
to
the
same
spot
with
her
latin
grammar
as
monitress
of
the
upper
landing
she
had
the
whole
of
the
third
class
under
her
care
and
seeing
one
of
her
charges
in
such
distress
she
came
at
once
to
enquire
the
cause
you
need
be
at
all
afraid
to
tell
me
dear
she
said
if
got
yourself
into
a
scrape
it
my
business
to
help
you
just
tell
me
everything
as
you
would
to
your
elder
sister
i
have
got
any
sister
sobbed
sylvia
no
more
have
i
i
only
wish
i
had
so
i
going
to
pretend
now
that
you
mine
what
the
trouble
i
do
like
to
see
my
third
class
girls
crying
sylvia
never
forgot
how
kind
mercy
was
she
listened
patiently
to
the
whole
matter
and
then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
and
stroking
fluffy
hair
there
seem
to
have
been
faults
on
both
sides
she
said
at
last
does
it
strike
you
dear
that
it
just
a
little
selfish
of
you
to
want
to
keep
linda
entirely
to
yourself
but
she
my
friend
said
sylvia
in
astonishment
she
was
hazel
first
why
ca
you
all
be
jolly
together
without
this
continual
jealousy
you
be
a
great
deal
happier
said
sylvia
doubtfully
what
i
feel
though
is
that
i
mind
so
dreadfully
and
i
sure
linda
does
care
half
as
much
because
she
has
hazel
perhaps
she
cares
more
than
you
think
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
and
tell
her
exactly
what
happened
about
the
shoes
and
say
you
sorry
you
have
done
your
part
at
any
rate
and
if
she
likes
to
make
it
up
she
can
sylvia
took
mercy
advice
and
finding
linda
mooning
aimlessly
up
and
down
the
avenue
she
went
straight
to
the
point
without
any
further
delay
and
explained
the
whole
affair
i
afraid
it
was
i
who
was
cross
said
linda
i
been
feeling
perfectly
horrid
all
the
morning
i
hate
being
out
of
friends
with
anyone
and
especially
with
you
i
wish
my
wretched
dancing
shoes
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
have
you
planted
all
the
bulbs
yet
we
meant
to
put
the
snowdrops
in
the
middle
you
know
i
do
like
my
old
garden
at
all
it
no
fun
doing
it
alone
shall
i
bring
back
the
primroses
and
the
hepatica
chapter
vii
the
story
of
mercy
ingledew
one
result
of
the
coolness
and
subsequent
reconciliation
between
linda
and
sylvia
was
the
establishment
of
a
firm
friendship
between
the
latter
and
mercy
ingledew
sylvia
who
had
been
more
accustomed
at
home
to
people
than
children
was
attracted
to
mercy
at
once
and
the
elder
girl
saw
so
much
that
was
unusual
and
lovable
in
the
younger
one
character
that
she
took
a
strong
interest
in
getting
to
know
her
better
mercy
was
a
tall
fair
girl
of
sixteen
with
a
sweet
thoughtful
face
and
a
particularly
pleasant
open
expression
she
was
a
great
favourite
both
with
teachers
and
pupils
a
plodding
conscientious
worker
and
always
ready
to
give
help
or
sympathy
to
anyone
who
stood
in
need
of
either
miss
kaye
had
made
a
wise
choice
in
appointing
her
monitress
of
the
upper
landing
as
no
one
could
have
more
fully
appreciated
the
responsibilities
of
the
post
she
tried
as
much
as
lay
in
her
power
to
all
the
eight
little
girls
of
the
third
class
looking
after
them
in
their
bedrooms
reviewing
their
clothing
helping
to
brush
their
hair
settling
their
disputes
advising
them
in
any
question
of
right
and
wrong
and
keeping
them
up
to
the
mark
in
matters
of
school
discipline
and
she
managed
to
do
it
in
such
a
jolly
hearty
affectionate
tactful
manner
that
not
one
of
them
resented
her
interference
mercy
had
very
soon
discovered
that
sylvia
had
far
more
in
her
than
most
girls
of
her
age
the
expressive
eyes
lost
sometimes
in
a
brown
study
or
shining
with
excitement
over
some
new
pleasure
told
a
tale
of
the
eager
mind
behind
them
and
the
child
many
quaint
remarks
decided
opinions
the
flashes
of
humour
or
flights
of
fancy
in
which
she
occasionally
indulged
singled
her
out
as
possessing
powers
far
beyond
the
average
she
has
just
twice
the
brains
of
connie
camden
or
nina
forster
said
mercy
to
a
fellow
monitress
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
she
were
to
be
a
great
credit
to
the
school
some
day
you
should
hear
the
clever
games
she
invents
for
the
babies
and
the
marvellous
stories
she
makes
up
for
them
she
really
has
a
wonderful
imagination
she
has
got
through
nearly
half
the
waverley
novels
already
and
i
found
her
reading
tennyson
one
day
she
rather
too
fond
of
airing
her
ideas
and
is
a
little
conceited
but
hazel
and
marian
sit
upon
her
so
hard
that
she
soon
get
over
it
she
a
most
affectionate
child
far
more
so
than
any
of
the
others
she
the
only
one
who
ever
seems
really
grateful
for
what
one
does
for
them
i
think
she
a
dear
little
thing
and
i
glad
she
has
come
here
if
mercy
were
disposed
to
make
much
of
sylvia
the
latter
was
only
too
ready
to
return
her
kindness
with
that
devotion
which
a
younger
girl
often
feels
for
one
considerably
older
than
herself
with
sylvia
it
was
not
a
shifting
fancy
such
as
nina
forster
formed
nearly
every
week
and
changed
as
rapidly
but
a
genuine
love
founded
on
a
firm
basis
of
admiration
she
thought
mercy
the
prettiest
cleverest
and
best
girl
she
had
ever
known
in
her
life
and
when
she
discovered
her
to
be
the
heroine
of
a
most
romantic
history
her
interest
in
her
was
increased
a
thousandfold
she
had
heard
once
or
twice
that
mercy
was
an
orphan
and
had
no
home
of
her
own
to
go
to
during
the
holidays
but
it
was
only
by
degrees
she
gathered
the
various
facts
of
the
case
though
when
they
were
fitted
together
they
formed
a
narrative
as
thrilling
as
any
to
be
found
in
the
gaily
bound
volumes
over
which
it
had
been
her
delight
to
pore
as
sylvia
got
the
account
mostly
in
disjointed
scraps
first
from
one
girl
and
then
from
another
and
was
obliged
to
connect
them
for
herself
it
will
be
as
well
to
tell
mercy
story
here
as
she
learnt
it
more
fully
afterwards
since
it
had
some
bearing
and
influence
on
various
incidents
which
happened
later
and
led
in
the
end
to
unforeseen
events
fifteen
years
ago
there
was
great
uneasiness
among
the
white
residents
of
the
city
of
in
a
certain
inland
province
of
china
there
had
been
rumours
of
serious
riots
and
outrages
against
foreigners
farther
up
the
country
terrible
tales
were
whispered
of
houses
burnt
and
families
murdered
and
both
the
british
consul
and
the
commissioner
of
trade
had
warned
the
little
colony
of
europeans
to
keep
strictly
within
its
own
quarter
and
not
to
trust
to
any
fair
promises
made
by
their
neighbours
who
resented
their
presence
in
the
land
with
such
fierce
intolerance
business
for
a
while
was
suspended
it
was
not
considered
safe
for
a
white
face
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
and
even
the
chinese
servants
who
did
their
daily
duties
in
the
houses
were
regarded
with
suspicion
only
the
ingledew
medical
missionary
station
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
near
the
old
gate
went
on
with
its
work
as
usual
nursing
the
sick
in
the
hospital
attending
to
the
numerous
outpatients
who
came
every
day
for
medicine
and
treatment
teaching
the
children
in
the
school
and
holding
the
daily
bible
readings
which
all
were
still
invited
to
attend
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
both
doctors
and
nurses
they
knew
that
they
carried
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
that
at
some
given
signal
the
flame
of
fanaticism
might
burst
out
and
hordes
of
shrieking
murderous
pigtailed
natives
might
sweep
over
the
mission
leaving
nothing
but
smoking
ruins
and
desolation
behind
them
it
was
with
a
troubled
mind
therefore
that
sister
grace
the
head
of
the
nursing
staff
went
out
one
evening
into
the
patch
of
enclosed
garden
which
surrounded
the
hospital
buildings
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
looked
far
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
hill
country
there
was
a
fierce
fiery
sunset
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
sky
were
stained
with
blood
and
the
cross
on
the
top
of
the
little
chapel
stood
out
dark
and
startling
against
the
lurid
background
she
passed
slowly
down
the
walk
to
shut
the
great
gate
which
though
open
by
day
to
every
comer
was
always
safely
barred
at
night
and
she
was
in
the
act
of
sliding
the
bolt
and
securing
the
chain
when
she
paused
suddenly
and
listened
she
had
heard
a
moan
outside
a
distinct
suffering
sigh
that
quivered
a
moment
and
then
died
away
into
silence
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
was
in
distress
or
pain
and
it
was
clearly
her
duty
to
enquire
into
the
cause
with
a
beating
heart
she
undid
the
fastening
and
peeped
out
crouched
down
on
the
step
as
if
she
could
drag
herself
no
farther
was
a
chinese
woman
bearing
a
baby
fastened
on
to
her
back
she
was
desperately
wounded
the
blood
still
flowed
from
a
gash
on
her
head
and
stains
on
the
roadside
marked
the
track
along
which
she
must
have
crawled
in
her
agony
to
reach
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
wooden
archway
life
was
almost
spent
but
with
an
effort
of
desperation
she
managed
to
raise
herself
into
a
kneeling
posture
and
clasping
her
hands
together
cried
out
in
chinese
mercy
mercy
the
child
and
with
a
last
glance
of
supplicating
appeal
fell
across
the
threshold
at
the
feet
of
the
trembling
nurse
help
was
summoned
at
once
and
she
was
carried
into
the
hospital
but
she
was
already
past
all
human
aid
she
had
accomplished
her
errand
with
the
last
spark
of
her
dying
strength
and
had
gone
out
into
the
light
beyond
the
sunset
sister
grace
took
the
baby
from
her
and
laid
the
little
creature
gently
on
the
bed
unfolding
some
of
the
curious
chinese
clothing
in
which
it
was
closely
wrapped
she
had
unloosed
the
wadded
coat
and
now
pulled
off
the
queer
crimson
cap
disclosing
as
she
did
so
not
the
expected
shaved
head
with
its
fringe
of
coarse
black
hair
but
a
crop
of
short
tight
flaxen
curls
like
rings
of
floss
silk
falling
round
a
pair
of
flushed
cheeks
as
pink
as
appleblossom
she
uttered
a
cry
that
drew
both
doctor
and
nurses
to
her
side
look
look
she
exclaimed
the
child
is
white
where
the
poor
baby
had
come
from
or
to
whom
it
belonged
no
one
knew
it
was
warm
and
unhurt
though
in
such
a
deep
sleep
that
it
had
evidently
been
drugged
to
prevent
it
from
crying
beyond
a
small
woollen
vest
it
was
dressed
in
chinese
clothes
no
doubt
with
the
intention
of
passing
it
off
as
a
native
and
it
wore
a
carved
chinese
charm
tied
round
its
neck
it
was
a
little
girl
of
apparently
about
a
year
old
so
round
and
pretty
and
dimpled
that
when
at
last
after
many
hours
she
opened
her
big
blue
eyes
she
won
all
hearts
in
the
hospital
at
once
it
was
impossible
to
institute
any
enquiries
regarding
her
during
the
troublous
time
which
followed
the
mission
indeed
escaped
attack
but
it
was
many
months
before
communication
with
the
outside
world
was
safely
established
and
by
then
every
clue
seemed
to
have
been
lost
the
consul
did
his
best
and
made
the
case
widely
known
among
the
european
residents
in
china
but
many
families
had
perished
in
the
uprising
and
no
one
could
tell
by
which
of
them
the
child
might
have
been
claimed
the
little
waif
stayed
on
therefore
at
the
ingledew
hospital
where
she
grew
apace
and
was
soon
the
pet
and
darling
of
everybody
who
knew
her
it
was
decided
to
call
her
mercy
in
memory
of
the
last
words
of
the
woman
who
had
saved
her
life
and
ingledew
was
added
as
a
surname
for
lack
of
any
other
it
was
when
she
was
about
seven
years
old
that
the
doctor
and
his
wife
who
were
returning
to
england
for
a
year
leave
determined
to
take
her
with
them
and
to
try
to
make
some
arrangements
for
her
education
a
philanthropic
lady
who
happened
to
join
the
ship
at
ceylon
heard
the
strange
story
and
taking
a
fancy
to
the
child
offered
to
send
her
to
school
so
it
was
in
this
way
that
mercy
had
come
to
miss
kaye
where
she
had
remained
ever
since
last
year
however
a
great
misfortune
had
occurred
her
kind
guardian
who
had
always
taken
the
warmest
interest
in
her
welfare
had
died
suddenly
without
making
a
will
her
heirs
did
not
feel
themselves
bound
to
continue
mercy
school
fees
and
again
she
was
left
utterly
unprovided
for
here
miss
kaye
had
come
to
the
rescue
and
had
promised
to
keep
her
at
heathercliffe
house
until
she
should
be
old
enough
to
earn
her
own
living
as
a
teacher
and
mercy
repaid
the
kindness
bestowed
upon
her
by
working
her
very
best
and
trying
to
fit
herself
for
the
career
which
she
was
to
follow
by
and
by
nine
years
at
aberglyn
had
blurred
her
memories
of
her
early
life
in
china
but
she
still
wrote
to
her
friends
at
the
mission
and
said
she
never
forgot
that
one
spot
though
other
scenes
might
have
faded
from
her
remembrance
though
sylvia
only
heard
this
account
of
mercy
childhood
at
secondhand
told
mostly
in
whispers
by
linda
when
they
were
in
bed
it
appealed
immensely
to
the
poetical
side
of
her
nature
and
invested
her
schoolfellow
with
a
halo
of
romance
that
added
greatly
to
her
other
charms
suppose
she
really
has
a
father
or
a
mother
said
sylvia
who
loved
to
let
her
imagination
run
riot
or
if
they
are
both
dead
perhaps
a
grandfather
or
a
grandmother
or
an
uncle
who
is
searching
for
her
everywhere
she
might
be
the
heiress
to
a
big
property
and
own
castles
and
halls
and
all
kinds
of
things
has
anybody
tried
to
find
out
oh
yes
lots
of
people
replied
linda
but
it
no
use
there
anything
to
trace
her
by
mercy
ca
bear
to
hear
it
spoken
of
unless
she
mentions
it
first
and
she
scarcely
ever
does
miss
kaye
said
it
was
much
wiser
for
her
not
to
think
about
it
because
it
was
such
a
forlorn
hope
and
it
was
better
to
be
content
with
the
friends
she
has
and
make
the
most
of
them
i
think
she
feels
it
though
sometimes
when
we
all
going
back
for
the
holidays
and
talking
about
our
homes
i
sure
she
must
oh
linda
would
it
be
lovely
if
we
could
find
out
her
relations
do
let
us
set
to
work
at
once
how
can
we
said
linda
who
had
a
practical
mind
i
do
know
quite
how
at
first
but
i
have
a
kind
of
feeling
it
may
be
done
if
we
only
try
i
going
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
it
as
interesting
as
or
just
think
that
almost
every
lady
whom
mercy
meets
may
be
her
mother
they
could
all
be
objected
linda
of
course
not
but
she
might
be
talking
to
some
of
her
own
relations
and
never
know
it
i
do
see
how
we
can
help
that
people
are
labelled
in
families
like
pots
of
different
kinds
of
jam
so
how
could
we
find
out
oh
do
be
stupid
i
only
mean
that
we
must
keep
our
eyes
and
our
ears
open
and
listen
for
every
opportunity
i
going
to
begin
and
if
you
like
to
help
you
can
and
if
you
do
you
need
greatly
fired
by
her
resolution
sylvia
was
anxious
to
solve
the
secret
of
her
friend
parentage
without
further
delay
unfortunately
she
did
not
know
exactly
how
to
start
it
was
impossible
to
question
mercy
herself
and
none
of
the
other
girls
knew
more
than
linda
had
told
her
she
decided
therefore
that
the
only
chance
was
to
notice
if
anyone
looked
as
if
they
were
seeking
somebody
when
perhaps
she
might
be
the
happy
means
of
bringing
about
the
fortunate
meeting
and
have
the
proud
satisfaction
of
saying
here
is
your
daughter
it
would
be
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
thought
sylvia
nicer
even
than
writing
a
book
though
i
mean
to
do
that
some
day
indeed
i
think
when
it
all
turned
out
properly
i
might
make
it
into
a
story
if
mercy
would
mind
i
could
call
it
waif
from
or
perhaps
little
only
she
quite
big
now
would
sound
beautiful
but
she
everybody
darling
so
that
would
do
i
believe
flower
of
heathercliffe
would
be
best
and
at
any
rate
i
could
put
true
tale
after
it
i
have
it
bound
in
red
or
green
with
gilt
edges
and
a
picture
of
mercy
on
the
back
the
first
step
to
such
a
flight
of
literary
ambition
was
evidently
to
discover
the
missing
friends
until
that
was
settled
the
whole
point
of
the
volume
would
be
lacking
and
it
was
useless
to
attempt
even
a
beginning
she
came
home
one
day
after
the
usual
morning
walk
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
overflowing
with
news
to
tell
linda
who
having
a
bad
cold
had
been
obliged
to
stay
in
the
house
what
do
you
think
she
cried
as
they
stood
washing
their
hands
together
in
the
bathroom
i
really
believe
i
have
found
a
clue
at
last
a
clue
to
what
asked
linda
who
had
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
by
that
time
why
to
mercy
ingledew
miss
coleman
took
us
to
aberglyn
this
morning
and
along
the
promenade
and
we
sat
down
for
a
rest
on
one
of
the
benches
connie
camden
and
i
were
quite
at
the
end
next
to
two
ladies
and
i
could
hear
everything
they
were
talking
about
one
of
them
the
tall
fair
one
was
most
dreadfully
sad
and
said
it
had
left
a
blank
and
the
other
the
short
fat
one
seemed
so
sorry
for
her
and
was
trying
to
comfort
her
did
you
lose
her
she
asked
i
could
hear
the
answer
because
connie
was
whispering
to
me
but
the
short
lady
said
me
as
long
ago
as
that
i
am
afraid
you
can
have
very
little
hope
of
ever
finding
her
now
then
connie
interrupted
again
but
i
caught
something
about
curly
hair
and
such
winning
ways
believe
she
has
been
traced
to
this
neighbourhood
the
fat
lady
said
are
quite
sure
you
would
be
able
to
know
her
from
any
other
could
mistake
the
tall
lady
said
eyes
alone
would
tell
me
even
if
she
had
utterly
forgotten
me
it
was
just
growing
most
interesting
when
miss
coleman
got
up
and
we
had
to
go
but
i
certain
we
on
the
right
track
and
it
mercy
looking
for
do
you
think
it
must
be
i
do
know
said
linda
doubtfully
it
might
be
somebody
else
oh
how
could
it
be
it
all
exactly
fits
in
with
mercy
story
and
the
tall
fair
lady
was
in
deep
mourning
too
she
would
still
be
in
mourning
said
linda
it
fifteen
years
since
mercy
was
lost
she
might
be
perhaps
she
made
up
her
mind
never
to
wear
anything
else
until
she
found
her
shall
i
tell
mercy
no
i
sure
you
had
better
not
miss
kaye
said
we
were
none
of
us
ever
to
mention
it
to
her
then
i
must
find
out
a
little
more
and
it
will
come
as
a
surprise
to
her
in
the
end
do
breathe
a
word
to
any
of
the
other
girls
i
want
it
to
be
a
dead
secret
nobody
knows
a
hint
about
it
except
you
and
me
sylvia
felt
almost
bursting
with
the
importance
of
her
quest
her
great
anxiety
now
was
to
meet
the
lady
again
and
make
a
few
further
discoveries
she
wished
she
knew
her
name
or
where
she
lived
and
much
regretted
that
she
had
not
taken
the
opportunity
of
saying
something
about
mercy
at
the
time
it
would
be
so
dreadful
if
i
did
get
a
chance
to
see
her
any
more
she
thought
perhaps
she
only
a
visitor
at
aberglyn
and
she
may
go
home
without
anything
happening
after
all
every
day
when
they
went
for
their
walk
she
looked
out
both
for
the
tall
fair
lady
and
the
short
fat
one
but
she
never
saw
either
though
she
managed
to
persuade
miss
coleman
to
take
them
twice
again
to
the
promenade
an
indulgence
in
one
week
i
do
know
what
we
to
do
she
lamented
to
linda
i
must
see
her
somehow
i
feel
as
if
mercy
future
depends
upon
it
she
looks
nice
too
i
wonder
how
mercy
will
like
her
for
a
mother
just
think
of
having
to
get
to
know
your
own
mother
when
you
sixteen
would
it
seem
queer
perhaps
she
may
be
in
church
on
sunday
i
do
see
how
you
could
speak
to
her
even
if
she
were
said
linda
we
go
out
by
the
side
door
and
you
would
be
likely
to
meet
her
in
the
churchyard
i
wish
miss
kaye
would
take
me
shopping
on
saturday
said
sylvia
it
sadie
thompson
turn
i
wonder
if
i
could
coax
her
to
change
with
me
it
was
miss
kaye
custom
to
allow
four
of
the
girls
to
go
with
her
each
saturday
morning
to
aberglyn
and
assist
with
her
marketing
they
were
trusted
to
make
some
of
the
purchases
to
teach
them
the
value
of
money
and
were
expected
to
put
down
a
neat
account
afterwards
of
what
they
had
spent
it
was
a
privilege
to
which
they
greatly
looked
forward
and
it
had
not
yet
fallen
to
sylvia
share
by
dint
however
of
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
added
to
the
gift
of
her
cedarwood
pencil
box
she
induced
sadie
thompson
to
let
her
have
the
next
turn
and
as
miss
kaye
made
no
objection
to
the
exchange
she
found
herself
included
among
the
favoured
few
nothing
could
have
been
more
fortunate
the
party
consisted
of
mercy
ingledew
trissie
knowles
from
the
second
class
herself
and
nessie
hirst
and
they
started
off
in
brisk
spirits
in
every
shop
and
street
sylvia
eyes
were
busy
seeking
for
the
two
ladies
but
though
in
the
distance
she
thought
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
short
one
she
found
out
on
a
nearer
view
that
she
was
mistaken
they
went
at
last
into
the
markethall
where
miss
kaye
was
soon
busy
at
a
glass
and
china
stall
replenishing
some
of
the
school
crockery
which
had
been
broken
you
little
ones
she
said
may
go
and
buy
me
a
pennyworth
of
parsley
and
three
lemons
be
sure
you
choose
lemons
with
nice
smooth
rinds
and
bring
back
the
right
change
for
a
shilling
sylvia
and
nessie
ran
off
together
to
the
fruiterer
proud
of
their
errand
and
were
just
engaged
in
calculating
the
cost
of
three
lemons
at
each
when
sylvia
gave
a
gasp
of
astonishment
and
delight
round
the
corner
and
actually
coming
to
their
stall
appeared
the
tall
fair
lady
and
the
short
fat
one
they
stopped
to
enquire
the
price
of
pears
and
stood
so
near
that
the
long
mantle
of
the
former
was
actually
brushing
against
sylvia
hat
she
trembled
all
over
with
excitement
dare
she
do
it
could
she
really
pluck
up
her
courage
and
speak
to
this
unknown
stranger
she
tried
half
a
dozen
times
but
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
yet
she
felt
she
must
make
the
effort
for
perhaps
mercy
happiness
might
hang
upon
this
one
solitary
chance
if
you
please
she
began
in
a
very
small
trembling
voice
and
touching
the
lady
sleeve
with
her
hand
but
the
lady
was
too
busy
buying
pears
to
notice
and
only
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
her
purse
if
you
please
tried
sylvia
again
speaking
rather
louder
this
time
i
think
this
little
girl
wishes
to
ask
you
something
said
the
short
fat
lady
addressing
her
friend
the
tall
fair
one
turned
suddenly
round
towards
sylvia
what
is
it
my
dear
she
said
somewhat
stiffly
can
i
tell
you
anything
sylvia
flushed
scarlet
the
critical
moment
had
arrived
oh
please
she
said
i
thought
you
had
found
her
yet
and
i
believe
i
know
where
she
is
not
my
tottie
exclaimed
the
lady
i
do
know
her
real
name
but
we
call
her
mercy
said
sylvia
i
heard
you
say
on
the
promenade
that
you
lost
her
so
i
have
i
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
recover
her
i
even
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
police
where
did
you
find
her
she
been
at
school
for
ever
so
long
said
sylvia
at
heathercliffe
house
she
added
in
explanation
i
never
dreamt
of
asking
there
said
the
lady
i
should
have
thought
miss
kaye
would
have
kept
her
but
no
doubt
she
has
been
a
great
favourite
amongst
the
girls
she
is
we
all
love
her
declared
sylvia
delighted
with
the
success
of
her
boldness
but
where
is
she
have
you
got
her
safe
at
heathercliffe
house
enquired
the
lady
she
here
now
in
the
market
replied
sylvia
triumphantly
where
oh
where
just
in
the
next
row
at
the
pot
stall
let
us
go
at
once
said
the
tall
lady
hastily
paying
for
her
fruit
and
hurrying
away
in
as
much
agitation
as
sylvia
herself
i
do
see
her
she
continued
in
a
disappointed
tone
when
they
had
turned
the
corner
looking
anxiously
among
the
crockery
laid
on
the
ground
and
even
peeping
under
the
stall
she
there
with
miss
kaye
said
sylvia
where
my
dear
of
course
you
wo
recognize
her
because
she
grown
so
but
that
tall
fair
girl
with
the
long
light
hair
oh
may
i
tell
her
or
would
you
rather
tell
her
yourself
the
lady
looked
first
at
sylvia
and
then
at
her
short
friend
with
a
most
puzzled
expression
what
is
the
child
talking
about
she
asked
i
do
understand
you
said
you
lost
her
faltered
sylvia
so
i
did
and
there
she
is
your
own
daughter
daughter
cried
the
lady
almost
dropping
her
parcel
in
her
surprise
it
was
my
dear
little
dog
i
was
speaking
of
i
thought
you
said
you
had
found
her
what
is
the
matter
said
miss
kaye
coming
up
at
this
moment
i
believe
i
am
addressing
rushworth
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
oh
no
we
have
found
no
dog
if
we
had
i
should
have
sent
it
at
once
to
the
police
station
i
am
sorry
there
should
have
been
a
mistake
come
sylvia
the
disappointment
was
so
horrible
and
tragic
and
so
different
from
anything
she
had
expected
that
sylvia
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
was
this
the
end
of
all
her
plans
instead
of
accomplishing
anything
useful
she
had
only
made
herself
look
extremely
silly
and
she
wondered
what
miss
kaye
would
have
to
say
about
it
at
first
the
headmistress
took
no
notice
she
quietly
finished
her
purchases
then
bidding
nessie
hirst
go
on
with
trissie
and
mercy
she
gave
sylvia
a
parcel
to
carry
and
told
her
to
walk
by
her
side
she
made
no
remark
while
they
were
still
in
the
town
but
once
they
were
out
on
the
country
road
she
began
to
ask
questions
and
drew
a
full
explanation
from
her
sobbing
pupil
do
cry
my
dear
she
said
kindly
you
have
done
your
best
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
has
tried
to
find
poor
mercy
relations
but
the
issue
is
in
higher
hands
than
ours
do
not
speak
to
her
of
what
has
happened
this
morning
it
is
a
subject
which
has
caused
her
such
great
grief
that
i
always
shrink
from
allowing
it
to
be
mentioned
the
truest
way
to
prove
your
friendship
is
to
help
her
to
forget
that
she
is
alone
in
the
world
though
we
can
not
supply
the
place
of
her
own
parents
we
can
at
least
show
her
how
much
we
love
her
and
make
her
feel
that
she
has
many
friends
to
compensate
her
for
the
loss
of
father
and
mother
chapter
viii
eve
and
guy
fawkes
october
had
passed
so
swiftly
that
sylvia
could
hardly
realize
that
she
had
now
been
almost
a
month
at
school
in
some
respects
the
time
appeared
short
yet
in
others
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
settled
there
for
years
and
she
no
longer
felt
herself
to
be
a
new
girl
the
days
which
had
been
bright
and
summerlike
when
first
she
arrived
were
now
rapidly
closing
in
there
was
no
recreation
in
the
garden
after
four
as
miss
kaye
considered
it
too
damp
and
cold
for
them
to
be
out
and
they
were
obliged
to
amuse
themselves
in
the
playroom
instead
the
great
excitement
at
present
was
the
near
approach
of
eve
when
it
was
the
custom
for
the
whole
school
to
meet
and
spend
the
evening
in
bobbing
and
other
amusements
miss
kaye
gets
a
whole
cask
said
linda
those
lovely
big
american
ones
and
we
have
such
fun
we
all
sit
up
till
eight
even
the
babies
and
nobody
minds
how
much
noise
we
make
i
do
know
which
is
nicest
or
guy
fawkes
day
oh
i
like
the
fifth
of
november
said
nina
forster
we
do
do
properly
here
bobbing
is
nothing
what
do
you
do
at
home
then
asked
sylvia
we
have
a
large
party
and
put
bowls
of
water
in
front
of
the
fire
and
touch
them
blindfolded
to
see
who
be
married
first
my
big
sister
once
combed
her
hair
before
the
looking
glass
at
midnight
to
see
if
the
shadow
of
her
future
husband
would
appear
peeping
over
her
shoulder
and
my
brother
alec
crept
in
and
got
behind
her
and
pulled
a
horrible
face
and
she
shrieked
and
shrieked
sometimes
too
we
go
into
the
garden
and
drag
up
cabbage
stalks
to
try
our
luck
miss
kaye
wo
let
us
do
any
of
those
things
said
linda
she
says
it
silly
superstition
she
was
dreadfully
cross
one
evening
with
trissie
knowles
and
marjorie
ward
because
she
caught
them
both
curtsying
to
the
new
moon
but
she
lets
us
have
fun
with
the
apples
and
that
all
i
care
about
at
seven
therefore
on
october
when
evening
preparation
was
finished
the
four
classes
collected
for
the
promised
entertainment
sylvia
whose
home
life
had
been
a
very
quiet
one
had
never
been
present
on
such
an
occasion
and
she
anticipated
it
with
much
delight
as
linda
had
said
miss
kaye
had
been
liberal
enough
to
provide
a
whole
barrel
of
apples
which
stood
on
two
chairs
placed
together
near
her
desk
the
ripest
roundest
rosiest
ones
which
could
possibly
be
several
long
strings
had
been
fastened
to
a
beam
which
ran
across
the
roof
and
to
the
end
of
each
of
these
an
apple
was
fastened
the
girls
in
turn
had
their
hands
tied
behind
their
backs
and
had
to
try
to
take
a
bite
from
an
apple
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
its
string
a
very
difficult
performance
since
it
generally
bobbed
and
wriggled
and
slid
away
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
they
were
about
to
put
their
teeth
into
it
causing
a
great
deal
of
mirth
and
merriment
and
much
triumph
to
the
lucky
one
who
managed
at
last
to
take
a
successful
mouthful
and
so
secure
the
coveted
treasure
three
large
footbaths
had
also
been
brought
into
the
schoolroom
and
put
on
forms
where
they
were
filled
with
water
and
apples
then
the
girls
were
allowed
to
gather
round
and
holding
forks
in
their
mouths
to
drop
them
into
the
water
in
the
hope
of
spearing
an
apple
not
nearly
such
an
easy
feat
as
it
looked
and
one
which
seemed
to
depend
mostly
on
good
fortune
of
course
it
was
great
fun
especially
when
miss
kaye
tried
it
herself
and
her
fork
just
stuck
in
the
largest
and
juiciest
and
then
rolled
out
again
or
when
connie
camden
in
despair
of
having
any
success
dipped
her
whole
head
and
shoulders
into
the
bath
getting
so
dreadfully
drenched
in
the
process
that
she
was
promptly
sent
upstairs
to
bed
a
sadder
and
wiser
girl
for
miss
kaye
had
strictly
forbidden
any
wetting
of
hair
under
penalty
of
instant
expulsion
from
the
room
and
she
invariably
kept
to
her
word
sylvia
won
two
apples
both
with
a
fork
she
did
not
prove
clever
at
catching
them
with
her
teeth
though
linda
carried
away
four
and
marian
woodhouse
six
altogether
which
however
she
shared
with
gwennie
who
had
had
bad
luck
and
gained
nothing
the
evening
ended
with
some
rousing
games
of
hunt
the
slipper
dumb
crambo
and
drop
the
handkerchief
even
miss
arkwright
ran
about
and
played
and
was
so
pleasant
and
jolly
that
sylvia
hardly
knew
her
and
miss
kaye
was
the
life
and
soul
of
it
all
managing
to
include
everybody
to
see
that
the
little
ones
got
a
fair
chance
that
nobody
cheated
or
took
an
undue
advantage
suppressing
quarrels
arranging
turns
and
directing
her
flock
like
the
wise
shepherd
that
she
always
proved
herself
to
be
it
was
a
quarter
to
nine
before
the
girls
hot
and
flushed
and
with
most
untidy
hair
said
goodnight
and
filed
upstairs
to
their
rooms
where
they
were
obliged
to
sober
down
when
the
monitresses
went
their
rounds
and
go
to
bed
with
a
due
regard
for
order
and
decorum
rules
and
regulations
being
strictly
enforced
even
on
i
dreadfully
sorry
for
connie
said
linda
as
she
brushed
her
hair
i
ca
think
what
made
her
dip
her
head
right
in
like
that
she
always
doing
silly
things
when
we
went
to
llandudno
last
summer
she
sat
down
in
the
sea
when
we
were
wading
and
she
tumbled
off
her
donkey
and
scraped
the
skin
from
her
nose
and
only
this
term
when
they
were
coming
to
school
rosie
gave
her
their
tickets
to
hold
and
she
dropped
them
on
to
the
line
underneath
the
train
the
guard
was
so
angry
he
threatened
to
make
them
pay
their
fares
because
no
one
could
get
the
tickets
until
the
train
had
gone
out
of
the
station
and
both
they
and
the
guard
were
going
in
it
but
dolly
cried
so
he
said
he
would
this
once
only
they
must
be
more
careful
another
time
just
think
of
connie
having
to
stay
in
bed
and
hear
the
noise
we
were
making
downstairs
i
should
have
felt
pretty
cross
if
it
had
happened
to
me
i
sent
her
one
of
my
apples
and
hazel
said
she
give
her
one
of
hers
still
it
hard
luck
all
the
same
it
was
but
a
few
days
now
to
the
fifth
of
november
the
school
having
spent
its
excitement
over
began
to
work
it
up
again
harder
than
ever
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
guy
fawkes
the
little
ones
went
about
singing
please
to
remember
the
fifth
of
november
with
gunpowder
treason
and
plot
for
i
see
no
reason
why
gunpowder
treason
should
ever
be
forgot
till
everybody
grew
completely
tired
of
the
tune
and
squashed
them
miss
arkwright
improved
the
opportunity
by
making
the
third
class
read
up
the
subject
in
their
history
book
and
write
a
special
essay
upon
it
with
the
date
and
principal
persons
concerned
the
girls
had
been
allowed
to
contribute
from
their
pocket
money
to
buy
fireworks
and
materials
for
a
bonfire
miss
kaye
gets
old
hampers
and
barrels
from
the
greengrocer
said
linda
some
paraffin
is
poured
over
them
and
they
make
the
most
glorious
blaze
and
then
when
the
fire
has
burnt
down
a
little
we
roast
potatoes
in
the
ashes
and
they
taste
most
delicious
cameron
always
comes
to
let
off
the
fireworks
miss
kaye
cousin
and
he
so
jolly
he
keeps
making
jokes
the
whole
time
though
he
wo
let
any
of
us
stand
very
near
for
fear
of
sparks
catching
our
dresses
then
we
have
heaps
and
heaps
of
toffee
it
put
on
great
plates
and
handed
round
and
there
are
big
slices
of
parkin
too
i
heard
emmie
hall
say
she
believed
there
was
going
to
be
a
guy
fawkes
this
year
said
sylvia
no
is
there
oh
that
would
be
fun
how
did
she
get
to
know
edna
lowe
had
to
go
to
miss
kaye
room
to
take
a
dose
of
powder
and
she
saw
a
big
mask
on
the
table
and
an
old
jacket
hanging
over
a
chair
miss
kaye
whisked
them
away
in
a
moment
but
she
had
quite
time
to
notice
what
they
were
and
of
course
she
told
lily
afterwards
and
lily
told
emmie
we
have
had
a
guy
since
i
was
here
said
linda
and
we
never
had
one
at
home
either
oh
i
do
want
to
see
it
so
much
i
hope
miss
kaye
really
going
to
make
one
it
will
be
the
most
delicious
glorious
fun
that
ever
was
i
wish
wednesday
would
hurry
up
and
come
the
girls
had
raised
a
general
subscription
to
provide
the
fireworks
which
were
ordered
to
be
sent
from
a
large
shop
in
the
town
but
no
one
was
allowed
to
buy
anything
privately
miss
kaye
naturally
thinking
that
squibs
and
crackers
were
dangerous
in
young
and
unpractised
hands
and
that
it
was
better
not
to
run
the
risk
of
accidents
we
may
even
get
a
box
of
coloured
matches
grumbled
a
few
of
the
third
class
as
they
gathered
in
the
playroom
on
monday
at
four
and
i
sure
there
could
be
no
harm
in
that
for
you
only
to
strike
them
and
hold
them
in
your
fingers
miss
kaye
makes
as
much
children
of
us
as
if
we
were
all
in
the
kindergarten
declared
hazel
crossly
i
wish
we
had
some
chestnuts
at
any
rate
it
would
be
so
jolly
to
roast
them
on
the
bars
you
have
some
on
wednesday
to
roast
in
the
bonfire
yes
but
i
rather
have
them
now
there
be
plenty
of
things
on
wednesday
and
it
so
slow
there
nothing
to
do
but
hang
about
till
teatime
i
say
i
have
an
idea
and
she
stooped
down
and
whispered
something
in
linda
ear
oh
no
hazel
we
dare
cried
linda
her
eyes
wide
with
delighted
horror
you
do
really
mean
it
of
course
i
do
mean
what
asked
nina
full
of
curiosity
i
do
think
i
let
you
know
it
a
secret
yes
do
i
never
tell
truly
and
honestly
i
wo
well
why
should
we
slip
out
of
the
side
door
and
run
down
the
road
to
that
little
shop
at
the
corner
of
valley
lane
we
could
buy
some
chestnuts
there
and
perhaps
some
fireworks
as
well
i
have
sixpence
here
in
my
pocket
oh
we
should
be
caught
no
we
should
if
we
manage
well
nobody
will
see
us
and
it
take
ten
minutes
there
plenty
of
time
before
tea
who
come
no
one
spoke
the
adventure
was
so
serious
that
each
girl
felt
rather
doubtful
about
undertaking
it
and
shook
her
head
well
you
are
a
set
of
cowards
said
hazel
i
wish
connie
camden
was
having
her
music
lesson
she
go
in
a
second
linda
you
might
do
linda
pleaded
sylvia
it
really
is
worth
it
i
sha
linda
is
bound
to
ask
your
leave
said
hazel
sharply
she
can
do
as
she
likes
i
suppose
come
linda
it
would
be
such
a
joke
i
sure
marian
would
let
me
go
said
gwennie
or
go
herself
either
she
at
her
practising
now
all
right
i
do
want
either
of
you
nor
jessie
ellis
but
nina
you
like
a
little
fun
i
know
come
with
linda
and
me
i
did
say
i
would
faltered
linda
yes
you
will
and
nina
too
we
three
are
the
only
ones
in
the
class
with
an
ounce
of
courage
nina
hesitated
a
moment
and
was
lost
she
was
very
easily
led
and
it
flattered
her
so
much
to
have
hazel
prestbury
actually
begging
for
her
company
that
she
had
not
the
strength
of
character
to
refuse
linda
looked
first
at
one
of
her
friends
and
then
at
the
other
they
were
almost
equally
balanced
in
her
affections
but
on
this
occasion
hazel
the
elder
the
more
important
and
the
more
persuasive
slightly
turned
the
scale
i
do
know
whether
i
really
go
she
said
but
i
come
as
far
as
the
gate
and
watch
you
start
there
ca
be
much
harm
in
that
miss
coleman
said
we
must
go
into
the
garden
raining
volunteered
gwennie
oh
bother
we
do
mind
the
rain
by
the
way
you
girls
must
all
promise
faithfully
you
wo
be
so
mean
as
to
tell
said
hazel
you
need
be
in
the
least
afraid
replied
sylvia
rising
and
going
over
to
the
bookcase
we
none
of
us
telltales
at
any
rate
whatever
other
names
you
may
call
us
the
naughty
trio
crept
quietly
from
the
playroom
into
the
where
their
garden
hats
and
jackets
were
kept
then
quite
forgetting
either
to
change
their
shoes
or
put
on
goloshes
they
ran
into
the
drizzling
rain
and
keeping
well
behind
the
bushes
soon
reached
the
front
gate
and
peeped
cautiously
out
nobody
was
in
sight
the
road
looked
perfectly
clear
and
it
would
hardly
take
five
minutes
to
gain
the
small
shop
in
valley
lane
and
buy
what
they
wanted
come
along
said
hazel
holding
out
her
hand
to
linda
but
linda
stopped
the
remembrance
of
a
look
she
had
seen
in
eyes
rose
up
before
her
again
her
friends
seemed
to
be
pulling
in
two
different
ways
and
her
own
better
judgment
told
her
which
was
the
right
one
i
think
i
wo
she
said
i
only
came
to
see
you
off
you
know
i
going
back
to
play
draughts
with
sylvia
very
well
replied
hazel
much
offended
nina
and
i
will
go
by
ourselves
do
expect
any
of
the
chestnuts
or
fireworks
for
you
sha
have
them
linda
managed
to
return
through
the
garden
unobserved
and
finding
sylvia
in
the
classroom
the
two
sat
chatting
quietly
until
the
teabell
rang
nina
and
hazel
came
in
to
tea
rather
out
of
breath
and
with
very
red
cheeks
we
got
them
they
whispered
a
whole
bag
of
lovely
chestnuts
and
two
boxes
of
coloured
matches
and
a
magic
snake
egg
we
ran
all
the
way
back
and
did
see
anybody
but
a
policeman
we
going
to
have
such
a
jubilee
nina
coming
into
our
bedroom
to
let
off
the
snake
with
connie
and
me
said
hazel
it
no
fun
with
only
jessie
ellis
said
nina
when
tea
was
over
and
the
girls
were
just
leaving
the
room
miss
kaye
called
to
hazel
nina
and
linda
saying
she
wished
to
speak
to
them
for
a
moment
she
held
elsie
thompson
by
the
hand
and
motioned
the
children
into
her
study
now
girls
she
said
gravely
i
wish
to
ask
you
something
elsie
tells
me
that
she
was
looking
out
of
the
top
landing
window
before
tea
and
she
saw
you
all
three
go
through
the
garden
to
the
gate
and
run
down
the
road
towards
aberglyn
is
this
true
no
miss
kaye
replied
hazel
promptly
we
did
go
out
anywhere
did
we
nina
no
said
nina
though
with
less
assurance
it
was
a
bold
step
of
hazel
to
deny
what
they
had
done
but
elsie
thompson
habit
of
making
up
stories
was
well
known
and
on
this
account
she
hoped
they
might
escape
linda
gave
no
reply
she
was
in
a
terrible
difficulty
to
tell
the
truth
would
of
course
implicate
the
other
two
yet
she
was
not
prepared
with
such
a
deliberate
falsehood
did
you
go
down
the
aberglyn
road
linda
asked
the
headmistress
no
miss
kaye
said
linda
feeling
that
her
truth
was
only
half
a
truth
after
all
and
more
ashamed
of
herself
than
she
liked
to
think
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
miss
kaye
looking
relieved
elsie
is
such
a
little
girl
that
i
believe
she
hardly
knows
yet
how
naughty
it
is
to
tell
such
wrong
tales
i
shall
have
to
be
very
cross
with
you
elsie
if
you
do
so
again
and
shaking
her
head
at
the
small
she
dismissed
the
four
hazel
waited
till
they
were
safely
down
the
passage
then
seizing
elsie
by
the
arm
she
gave
her
a
hard
smack
you
nasty
little
thing
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
by
telling
tales
about
us
to
miss
kaye
but
i
really
saw
you
wailed
elsie
you
did
and
if
you
say
a
word
about
this
to
sadie
or
may
spencer
or
anybody
else
a
big
black
bogy
will
come
to
your
bed
and
eat
you
up
yes
he
will
she
said
as
poor
little
elsie
fled
in
terror
to
the
playroom
he
told
me
so
himself
i
never
thought
elsie
would
see
us
said
hazel
it
was
most
unfortunate
we
got
out
of
it
better
than
i
expected
though
we
shall
have
to
hide
away
those
chestnuts
it
wo
be
safe
to
roast
them
or
to
let
off
the
snake
either
oh
hazel
i
wish
you
had
done
it
said
linda
we
told
the
most
dreadful
stories
well
you
have
at
any
rate
miss
kaye
asked
if
you
had
been
down
the
aberglyn
road
and
you
did
go
so
you
only
said
what
was
quite
true
yes
but
oh
what
the
use
of
we
ca
help
it
now
there
the
prep
bell
and
we
shall
have
to
go
along
i
hope
none
of
the
other
girls
will
say
anything
i
do
suppose
they
will
linda
went
into
preparation
with
a
very
uneasy
mind
she
was
a
truthful
child
and
could
not
bear
to
be
mixed
up
with
any
deceit
but
on
the
other
hand
she
did
not
like
to
get
her
classmates
into
trouble
she
was
astonished
that
hazel
should
behave
so
it
spoilt
her
faith
in
her
friend
and
recalled
to
her
memory
several
other
incidents
which
she
had
not
noticed
much
at
the
time
but
were
nevertheless
occasions
on
which
hazel
had
not
acted
in
a
strictly
honourable
manner
there
was
the
punch
and
judy
on
the
beach
thought
linda
when
she
asked
the
man
to
begin
and
promised
we
would
give
him
some
pennies
and
then
said
she
had
any
money
with
her
and
once
she
found
winnie
ingham
penknife
and
kept
it
in
her
pocket
for
a
week
without
telling
her
and
it
was
she
who
told
greta
collins
to
call
after
nellie
parker
because
she
only
put
down
threepence
for
the
fireworks
and
it
was
too
bad
for
nellie
hardly
has
any
pocket
money
and
she
had
given
all
she
had
oh
dear
i
wish
hazel
would
do
such
things
she
so
nice
in
every
other
way
i
like
her
immensely
but
what
i
think
is
horrid
she
only
laughs
at
and
calls
fun
sylvia
never
does
and
with
that
last
comparison
between
her
two
friends
linda
put
her
elbows
on
her
desk
and
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
tried
to
settle
herself
to
the
stern
task
of
learning
the
subjunctive
mood
of
the
verb
having
a
lively
horror
of
mademoiselle
wrath
on
the
morrow
if
she
went
to
the
french
class
with
an
lesson
chapter
ix
what
miss
kaye
thought
of
it
tuesday
passed
just
as
usual
and
no
casual
observer
would
have
noticed
that
anything
was
amiss
with
the
members
of
the
third
class
elsie
thompson
had
evidently
been
frightened
into
silence
by
threat
no
one
else
mentioned
the
subject
and
beyond
the
fact
that
nina
looked
pale
and
linda
rather
distressed
the
matter
seemed
likely
to
sink
into
oblivion
at
about
a
quarter
to
four
however
when
miss
arkwright
was
in
the
very
middle
of
explaining
the
difference
between
a
nominative
of
address
and
a
nominative
in
apposition
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
miss
kaye
made
her
appearance
she
so
seldom
came
into
a
class
during
the
afternoon
that
the
hearts
of
three
of
her
pupils
began
to
thump
their
guilty
consciences
telling
them
beforehand
that
her
errand
must
surely
concern
them
and
no
others
nor
were
they
mistaken
after
apologizing
to
miss
arkwright
for
interrupting
the
lesson
miss
kaye
turned
towards
the
girls
with
that
stern
look
in
her
eyes
which
they
knew
and
dreaded
to
meet
hazel
prestbury
linda
marshall
and
nina
forster
she
said
in
a
voice
that
though
quiet
was
full
of
emotion
i
am
deeply
grieved
to
find
that
you
have
been
deceiving
me
elsie
thompson
told
me
yesterday
that
she
had
seen
you
run
through
the
gate
and
down
the
road
towards
aberglyn
i
asked
you
if
this
were
so
and
you
all
three
denied
it
knowing
that
elsie
is
not
always
very
truthful
i
believed
your
word
in
preference
to
hers
this
afternoon
i
happened
to
meet
miss
newman
a
lady
who
lives
near
valley
lane
and
she
told
me
that
she
noticed
some
of
my
girls
coming
out
of
price
shop
yesterday
at
about
ten
minutes
to
five
and
hurrying
back
towards
heathercliffe
i
am
more
pained
than
i
can
tell
you
not
only
to
think
that
you
should
have
broken
the
rules
but
that
you
should
have
stooped
to
utter
such
deliberate
falsehoods
you
allowed
me
to
accuse
elsie
of
the
very
fault
you
were
committing
yourselves
and
meanly
left
her
to
bear
the
blame
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
and
hope
you
are
equally
ashamed
of
yourselves
go
at
once
to
your
bedrooms
your
tea
will
be
sent
to
you
later
i
feel
that
until
you
have
fully
realized
what
you
have
done
you
are
not
fit
to
mingle
with
the
rest
of
the
class
you
will
of
course
take
no
part
in
our
party
poor
linda
she
left
the
room
feeling
as
if
her
trouble
were
almost
greater
than
she
could
bear
it
was
impossible
now
to
explain
that
she
had
only
gone
as
far
as
the
gate
miss
kaye
would
probably
not
believe
her
and
in
any
case
would
think
that
she
was
trying
to
shirk
her
part
of
the
blame
and
cast
it
on
hazel
and
nina
she
was
beginning
to
experience
the
truth
of
the
old
proverb
that
you
can
not
touch
pitch
and
keep
your
hands
clean
she
had
never
intended
to
do
anything
in
the
least
dishonourable
but
having
taken
a
first
step
it
had
been
very
difficult
to
act
in
such
a
sudden
emergency
friendship
had
seemed
to
demand
that
she
should
not
betray
her
companions
though
their
conduct
certainly
did
not
justify
any
great
consideration
on
their
behalf
if
i
only
never
left
the
house
she
thought
or
if
i
had
told
miss
kaye
i
had
gone
into
the
garden
but
then
she
would
have
known
the
others
must
have
been
there
too
oh
it
all
a
horrid
puzzle
and
i
simply
miserable
i
sha
see
guy
fawkes
and
i
hate
everybody
and
everything
and
i
wish
i
were
at
home
she
went
to
bed
in
tears
which
increased
when
miss
coleman
brought
her
her
tea
and
after
collecting
sylvia
nightclothes
informed
her
that
her
roommate
together
with
connie
camden
and
jessie
ellis
were
to
sleep
in
a
large
bedroom
generally
called
the
hospital
and
no
one
would
be
allowed
even
to
come
in
and
speak
to
her
the
prospect
of
sleeping
alone
without
sylvia
made
her
feel
wretched
and
it
was
not
till
then
that
she
began
to
realize
how
much
her
friend
was
to
her
and
what
a
terrible
loss
it
would
be
if
they
were
separated
perhaps
miss
kaye
wo
let
us
have
a
bedroom
together
again
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
whom
she
put
me
with
suppose
she
sent
one
of
the
big
girls
to
sleep
here
bessie
cunningham
or
marjorie
moreton
how
hateful
it
would
be
there
never
be
any
fun
or
talks
in
bed
in
the
mornings
or
perhaps
i
shall
be
just
alone
as
i
was
before
sylvia
came
i
did
care
then
but
i
mind
it
dreadfully
now
i
so
accustomed
to
her
in
the
meantime
sylvia
was
feeling
as
dejected
as
linda
at
the
course
which
events
had
taken
she
knew
her
friend
was
not
so
much
to
blame
as
the
others
and
it
was
terrible
to
find
her
mixed
up
in
such
an
unpleasant
business
hazel
often
tells
stories
she
reflected
and
i
never
thought
much
of
nina
but
i
sure
linda
would
do
such
a
thing
there
must
be
some
mistake
if
i
could
only
see
her
and
get
her
to
explain
it
all
that
however
was
impossible
she
was
strictly
forbidden
to
go
into
her
bedroom
and
neither
miss
coleman
nor
miss
arkwright
would
give
any
news
of
the
three
banished
offenders
it
was
a
very
dismal
evening
in
the
playroom
for
the
remaining
members
of
the
third
class
it
cast
quite
a
gloom
over
their
spirits
connie
camden
did
not
tease
and
play
tricks
as
usual
and
jessie
ellis
had
to
retire
to
a
corner
occasionally
and
wipe
her
eyes
you
should
have
let
them
go
said
marian
to
sylvia
you
were
there
and
heard
their
plans
how
could
i
stop
them
cried
sylvia
indignantly
i
said
i
go
myself
hazel
is
more
than
a
year
older
than
i
am
and
she
never
listens
to
anything
i
say
she
was
as
rude
as
she
could
be
and
persuaded
the
others
to
go
with
her
did
you
want
me
to
go
telling
tales
to
miss
arkwright
no
but
you
might
have
said
more
i
do
believe
they
would
have
gone
if
i
had
been
there
i
should
have
thought
of
so
many
reasons
to
stop
them
it
was
a
great
pity
i
was
at
my
practising
said
marian
who
was
always
wise
after
an
event
well
why
did
gwennie
say
it
all
demanded
sylvia
she
was
there
gwennie
is
much
younger
and
is
expected
to
tell
people
what
they
ought
to
do
it
quite
enough
for
her
to
do
as
she
told
herself
i
only
four
months
older
than
gwennie
so
i
do
see
why
you
should
throw
the
blame
on
me
as
if
it
were
my
fault
that
they
went
said
sylvia
you
be
scolding
jessie
next
no
i
sha
she
so
stupid
no
one
takes
any
notice
of
her
different
and
ought
to
make
people
care
said
marian
getting
her
book
and
beginning
to
read
while
sylvia
doubtful
whether
the
last
remark
was
intended
for
a
compliment
or
a
reproof
took
out
her
writing
case
and
consoled
herself
by
beginning
a
long
letter
home
it
seemed
very
peculiar
and
gloomy
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
bed
in
her
own
room
she
and
connie
and
jessie
undressed
with
many
grumbles
in
the
hospital
and
hoped
they
would
not
be
compelled
to
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
the
term
they
ought
to
have
sent
the
others
here
instead
of
us
said
connie
we
being
punished
for
something
we
have
done
yes
but
the
others
would
have
been
together
and
that
what
miss
kaye
does
want
replied
sylvia
they
each
of
them
quite
alone
and
i
sure
they
must
be
having
a
wretched
time
i
wonder
if
they
will
be
in
school
evidently
miss
kaye
did
not
consider
them
yet
fit
to
take
their
places
among
the
others
for
they
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
nor
afterwards
in
the
classroom
the
headmistress
had
been
greatly
distressed
by
the
whole
affair
which
showed
such
a
sad
lack
of
the
moral
courage
and
high
standard
she
had
tried
to
impress
upon
all
her
girls
that
she
could
not
but
feel
a
sense
of
failure
she
decided
that
it
was
better
to
leave
them
for
some
little
time
to
themselves
that
they
might
have
leisure
to
consider
what
they
had
done
and
she
did
not
mean
to
let
them
return
to
their
places
until
after
the
fireworks
were
over
knowing
that
to
prevent
them
from
seeing
the
bonfire
was
the
greatest
punishment
she
could
inflict
nina
forster
in
any
case
would
not
have
been
able
to
be
present
the
run
down
the
wet
garden
and
road
in
her
house
shoes
which
she
had
not
afterwards
changed
had
brought
on
a
feverish
cold
and
sore
throat
and
she
was
tossing
about
in
bed
with
a
splitting
head
too
poorly
to
think
of
anything
but
her
aches
and
pains
the
day
dragged
slowly
along
lessons
seemed
very
strange
in
a
class
of
only
five
and
even
marian
missed
the
others
the
girls
went
out
into
the
courtyard
at
four
to
look
at
the
great
bonfire
which
the
gardener
had
been
busy
piling
up
inspected
the
tub
of
newly
washed
potatoes
which
the
cook
had
placed
outside
the
door
and
tried
to
cajole
some
pieces
of
toffee
from
cook
i
gave
it
all
to
miss
kaye
she
assured
them
and
it
locked
up
in
the
cupboard
it
not
a
single
piece
you
get
till
so
do
come
bothering
me
parkin
did
you
say
it
safe
in
the
storeroom
and
it
will
stay
there
till
seven
in
spite
of
a
slight
mist
it
promised
to
be
a
fine
evening
and
the
children
looked
anxiously
up
at
the
sky
hoping
it
would
be
clear
enough
to
show
off
the
rockets
to
advantage
the
fireworks
were
to
begin
after
six
at
which
hour
cameron
was
expected
to
arrive
and
with
the
gardener
aid
to
set
a
light
to
the
bonfire
it
no
fun
in
the
least
without
linda
thought
sylvia
wandering
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
to
see
if
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
friend
at
the
window
she
be
so
unhappy
all
alone
i
wonder
if
and
she
ran
back
to
the
side
door
as
quickly
as
she
could
for
a
new
idea
had
suddenly
struck
her
mercy
she
cried
meeting
the
monitress
in
the
passage
something
i
want
to
do
if
i
dare
do
you
think
miss
kaye
would
be
very
angry
with
me
i
ca
tell
you
till
i
know
what
it
is
said
mercy
smiling
what
do
you
wish
to
ask
her
linda
will
be
so
miserable
by
herself
this
evening
do
you
think
miss
kaye
would
let
me
stay
with
her
you
see
it
was
her
fault
half
as
much
as
the
others
because
she
did
really
go
with
them
how
do
you
know
she
did
asked
mercy
because
she
came
back
at
once
and
said
she
had
only
been
to
the
gate
she
and
i
sat
in
the
classroom
talking
till
teatime
my
dear
child
if
you
knew
this
you
ought
to
have
told
miss
kaye
about
it
before
ought
i
i
did
dare
she
looked
so
angry
i
thought
perhaps
linda
had
told
her
i
do
believe
she
did
at
any
rate
i
think
we
ought
to
make
sure
if
you
like
i
go
with
you
to
miss
kaye
now
she
in
her
study
oh
if
you
only
would
cried
sylvia
clasping
mercy
in
one
of
her
affectionate
hugs
i
should
mind
a
scrap
if
you
were
there
but
i
frightened
out
of
my
wits
to
go
alone
sylvia
clutched
mercy
arm
very
tightly
as
they
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
study
and
entered
in
response
to
miss
kaye
in
she
was
thankful
the
elder
girl
was
there
to
explain
her
errand
as
she
felt
so
shy
herself
she
was
sure
she
would
not
have
known
how
to
begin
you
are
quite
certain
sylvia
that
linda
did
not
accompany
the
others
to
price
shop
asked
miss
kaye
when
mercy
had
finished
her
account
quite
miss
kaye
replied
sylvia
she
never
said
she
would
hazel
tried
very
hard
to
persuade
her
and
she
promised
to
go
with
them
just
as
far
as
the
gate
she
could
have
gone
farther
because
she
was
back
in
a
few
minutes
i
know
she
came
in
the
moment
marian
woodhouse
stopped
practising
and
marian
always
has
the
piano
till
exactly
a
quarter
to
five
then
she
was
with
me
all
the
rest
of
the
time
until
tea
miss
newman
certainly
said
she
saw
two
girls
both
with
light
hair
said
miss
kaye
i
supposed
the
third
must
have
escaped
her
notice
i
am
glad
to
find
linda
is
not
quite
so
naughty
as
i
thought
i
will
go
to
her
at
once
and
see
if
she
is
able
to
explain
what
happened
afterwards
and
please
miss
kaye
said
sylvia
eagerly
as
the
mistress
rose
well
my
dear
would
you
let
me
stay
with
her
instead
of
going
to
the
bonfire
we
see
replied
miss
kaye
and
without
committing
herself
any
further
she
went
upstairs
sylvia
looked
at
miss
kaye
many
times
during
tea
trying
to
read
the
answer
in
her
face
but
the
latter
did
not
glance
in
her
direction
and
seemed
fully
occupied
in
a
conversation
with
mademoiselle
when
the
meal
was
over
however
she
called
to
her
to
remain
after
the
other
girls
had
left
the
room
i
have
seen
linda
she
said
and
find
her
thoroughly
sorry
for
any
part
she
has
played
which
has
not
been
perfectly
honourable
and
straighforward
i
am
sure
she
will
be
more
careful
in
future
to
avoid
even
the
shadow
of
an
untruth
as
i
think
she
was
trying
to
shield
nina
and
hazel
i
have
decided
not
to
punish
her
any
more
and
she
is
once
again
free
did
you
say
that
you
would
be
willing
to
give
up
your
share
of
the
fun
outside
and
spend
the
evening
with
her
yes
oh
yes
exclaimed
sylvia
and
miss
the
fireworks
i
do
mind
you
are
a
good
little
friend
but
it
is
not
necessary
linda
may
come
to
the
bonfire
and
you
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
running
upstairs
at
once
and
telling
her
so
yourself
you
may
be
sure
that
sylvia
flew
like
an
arrow
to
her
bedroom
to
announce
the
delightful
news
and
that
it
did
not
take
linda
long
to
put
on
her
outdoor
clothes
and
join
the
crowd
which
was
already
assembling
in
the
courtyard
cameron
had
just
arrived
he
was
a
tall
jolly
rather
elderly
gentleman
with
a
grey
moustache
and
an
endless
stock
of
jokes
which
he
fired
off
like
crackers
among
the
girls
they
all
knew
him
well
as
he
often
came
to
heathercliffe
house
his
daughter
doris
had
been
educated
there
and
though
she
was
now
nineteen
she
was
fond
of
her
old
school
and
had
accompanied
her
father
this
evening
to
watch
the
fireworks
out
of
my
way
shouted
cameron
make
room
for
the
principal
figure
the
leading
actor
on
the
stage
we
may
call
him
and
if
you
do
admire
him
it
your
own
bad
taste
he
was
staggering
from
the
house
as
he
spoke
carrying
in
his
arms
a
huge
guy
stuffed
with
straw
whose
comical
red
face
dangling
arms
and
helpless
legs
roused
shouts
of
laughter
all
round
there
said
cameron
seating
him
on
a
convenient
barrel
in
the
midst
of
the
bonfire
anyone
can
change
places
with
him
who
likes
he
may
look
clever
but
at
any
rate
i
can
guarantee
he
get
a
warm
reception
before
he
even
takes
the
trouble
to
open
his
mouth
now
then
stand
back
children
we
going
to
begin
illustration
in
a
few
minutes
a
grand
blaze
was
flaring
up
the
gardener
had
brought
out
a
large
torch
which
he
applied
to
some
loose
shavings
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
grand
blaze
was
flaring
up
catching
the
boxes
hampers
and
brushwood
of
which
the
pile
was
composed
cameron
fastened
a
match
to
the
end
of
a
pole
and
lighting
it
approached
within
a
few
feet
of
the
guy
now
look
he
said
watch
very
carefully
and
you
see
him
roll
his
eyes
he
applied
the
match
to
the
mask
where
two
small
had
been
fitted
in
front
of
the
empty
sockets
they
went
off
immediately
and
gave
exactly
the
appearance
of
two
horrible
flaming
eyes
whirling
round
and
round
in
the
big
head
the
younger
children
screamed
and
clung
delightedly
to
the
elder
ones
and
even
miss
kaye
was
quite
startled
at
the
effect
now
he
going
to
talk
declared
cameron
he
like
the
girl
in
the
fairy
tale
who
dropped
diamonds
and
pearls
whenever
she
opened
her
lips
he
held
his
lighted
pole
to
the
guy
mouth
where
a
roman
candle
was
hidden
inside
and
out
came
balls
of
red
and
blue
and
green
shooting
into
the
air
one
after
another
with
great
brilliance
by
this
time
the
flames
had
reached
his
arms
and
legs
which
being
stuffed
with
squibs
and
crackers
exploded
with
much
noise
and
the
luckless
conspirator
disappeared
with
a
crash
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
barrels
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
storm
of
clapping
and
a
lusty
cheer
when
the
blaze
had
somewhat
subsided
the
tub
of
potatoes
was
carried
out
and
each
girl
was
allowed
to
place
one
in
the
hot
ashes
together
with
several
chestnuts
which
could
be
roasting
while
they
ate
the
toffee
and
parkin
you
would
think
of
eating
sweet
things
just
before
you
had
potatoes
at
any
other
time
said
linda
but
everything
tastes
so
delicious
when
it
from
the
bonfire
cameron
was
getting
ready
to
let
off
the
more
important
fireworks
which
had
been
kept
till
the
end
and
the
girls
arranged
themselves
in
a
to
look
at
the
golden
rain
the
catherine
wheels
and
the
rockets
which
were
to
finish
the
festivities
he
had
prepared
a
surprise
for
them
by
writing
heathercliffe
house
in
gunpowder
on
the
ground
which
when
it
was
set
alight
stood
out
in
letters
of
flame
and
had
a
fine
effect
i
always
said
heathercliffe
house
ought
to
set
the
world
on
fire
he
laughed
and
we
done
it
as
linda
stood
watching
the
last
rocket
tearing
across
the
sky
she
put
her
arm
round
sylvia
shoulder
i
should
have
been
here
at
all
this
evening
except
for
you
she
whispered
it
was
lovely
of
you
to
go
to
miss
kaye
she
was
so
nice
about
it
when
i
said
i
was
sorry
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
frightened
of
her
again
three
cheers
for
miss
kaye
called
cameron
those
who
feel
they
have
had
a
jolly
time
may
join
me
and
those
who
do
had
better
go
to
bed
hip
hip
hooray
and
among
all
the
laughing
clapping
girls
there
were
none
who
responded
more
heartily
than
linda
and
sylvia
chapter
x
sylvia
birthday
nina
forster
was
obliged
to
remain
in
bed
for
several
days
but
hazel
prestbury
came
into
school
on
the
following
morning
rather
red
about
the
eyes
and
a
little
sulky
she
was
sorry
not
so
much
for
her
fault
as
for
being
found
out
and
she
blamed
herself
for
her
own
stupidity
i
might
have
known
some
tiresome
person
would
see
us
out
of
a
window
she
thought
miss
kaye
always
manages
to
get
to
hear
everything
she
felt
that
the
other
girls
disapproved
of
her
marian
spoke
her
mind
freely
on
the
subject
and
even
gentle
gwennie
did
not
appear
too
anxious
to
sit
next
to
her
linda
avoided
her
as
much
as
possible
keeping
strictly
to
sylvia
company
and
though
connie
camden
who
never
thought
about
anything
was
as
friendly
as
ever
it
did
not
quite
make
up
for
the
general
coldness
of
the
rest
the
girls
were
too
kind
to
send
her
to
coventry
but
hazel
felt
she
had
lost
her
former
position
in
the
class
it
was
a
severe
wound
to
her
pride
for
she
had
liked
to
be
considered
a
leader
and
had
always
been
pleased
to
see
how
easily
the
others
had
accepted
her
opinions
and
suggestions
as
the
eldest
she
had
possessed
a
good
deal
of
influence
and
her
greatest
punishment
was
to
find
it
gone
november
crept
on
fast
and
the
days
seemed
to
grow
rapidly
shorter
and
shorter
it
was
chilly
now
in
the
mornings
and
those
whose
hard
fate
it
was
to
be
obliged
to
practise
before
breakfast
grumbled
at
stiff
fingers
and
cold
toes
i
never
know
whether
i
like
it
or
not
said
sylvia
i
hate
it
when
i
in
bed
and
feel
i
give
all
the
world
not
to
have
to
get
up
so
early
but
when
it
done
it
so
nice
to
think
you
wo
have
to
do
it
at
four
i
wish
one
could
learn
music
without
practising
and
french
without
verbs
groaned
linda
looking
at
her
exercise
nearly
every
line
of
which
showed
corrections
in
neat
foreign
handwriting
i
think
some
people
are
born
bad
at
languages
and
i
one
of
them
i
never
can
understand
properly
what
mademoiselle
is
saying
and
then
she
gets
cross
and
says
i
attend
french
was
a
serious
trouble
to
sylvia
also
she
had
learnt
very
little
with
her
governess
at
home
and
found
it
most
difficult
to
keep
up
with
marian
who
had
rather
a
pretty
accent
and
was
good
at
translation
to
encourage
her
pupils
mademoiselle
had
offered
a
prize
to
whichever
could
write
the
best
letter
home
in
the
french
language
each
was
to
be
the
unaided
work
of
the
competitor
though
grammars
and
dictionaries
might
be
freely
consulted
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
all
the
girls
and
to
some
an
almost
impossible
one
but
mademoiselle
insisted
upon
everybody
at
least
making
an
attempt
and
laughed
in
private
over
the
funny
efforts
which
followed
if
the
prize
had
been
given
for
the
queerest
instead
of
the
best
letter
connie
camden
would
have
gained
it
she
grew
so
tired
of
looking
up
words
that
she
wrote
anything
she
thought
sounded
like
french
and
the
result
would
have
puzzled
a
native
to
decipher
it

this
however
was
the
worst
of
the
set
some
of
the
others
having
managed
to
express
themselves
quite
nicely
rather
to
astonishment
hazel
prestbury
won
the
prize
she
was
not
industrious
enough
to
gain
the
highest
marks
in
class
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
set
her
best
energies
to
work
and
her
letter
both
as
regards
composition
and
grammar
was
far
in
advance
of
all
competitors

thrill
of
triumph
as
mademoiselle
presented
her
with
a
charming
parisian
basket
full
of
choice
chocolates
accompanied
by
a
speech
in
french
which
nobody
understood
in
the
least
she
handed
it
round
amongst
the
girls
with
a
sense
that
she
had
at
last
somewhat
regained
her
lost
standing
and
when
the
basket
was
empty
had
the
satisfaction
of
overhearing
marian
remark
that
she
was
generous
with
her
sweets
and
gwennie
wish
that
she
knew
french
only
half
as
well
nina
forster
returned
to
class
after
a
week
absence
looking
pale
and
thin
and
with
a
white
knitted
shawl
wrapped
ostentatiously
round
her
shoulders
she
was
a
girl
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
being
delicate
and
liked
the
importance
of
having
a
fuss
made
over
her
there
was
always
a
large
bottle
of
tonic
on
the
sideboard
which
nina
gloried
in
being
obliged
to
swallow
and
she
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
if
miss
kaye
decided
that
it
was
too
damp
a
day
for
her
to
venture
out
i
ca
stand
much
you
know
she
would
explain
complacently
to
the
others
in
languid
tones
every
winter
i
have
been
laid
up
with
the
doctor
listening
at
my
bronchial
tube
and
taking
my
temperature
night
and
morning
it
makes
mother
most
unhappy
and
i
sure
miss
quite
worried
about
me
too
as
most
of
the
girls
did
not
know
the
exact
meaning
of
either
a
bronchial
tube
or
a
temperature
they
were
a
good
deal
impressed
and
allowed
nina
to
take
the
warmest
seat
and
the
biggest
piece
of
toffee
for
the
sake
of
her
throat
a
state
of
affairs
which
was
just
what
she
wanted
and
of
which
she
did
not
fail
to
take
advantage
to
the
uttermost
with
the
colder
weather
quilts
had
made
their
appearance
in
the
bedrooms
and
now
supplied
the
places
of
the
pretty
pink
coverlets
which
were
only
used
in
summer
it
felt
very
warm
and
comfortable
to
snuggle
down
under
them
at
night
when
the
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
rain
beating
fast
against
the
windows
and
very
hard
to
throw
them
back
and
get
up
in
the
dark
chilly
mornings
when
the
dressing
bell
was
ringing
in
the
passage
outside
sylvia
quilt
once
caused
her
an
experience
which
gave
her
a
greater
fright
than
she
had
ever
had
in
her
life
before
she
had
been
to
sleep
for
what
seemed
to
her
several
hours
and
woke
suddenly
with
a
curious
sense
that
someone
besides
herself
and
linda
was
in
the
room
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
quilt
were
being
very
gently
but
surely
pulled
from
her
bed
wideawake
in
an
instant
she
pulled
it
back
and
lay
listening
with
strained
ears
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
but
linda
placid
breathing
and
the
drip
of
the
rain
from
the
spout
outside
the
window
again
the
quilt
slowly
began
to
move
and
this
time
she
was
certain
she
caught
a
slight
sound
could
it
be
possible
that
a
burglar
was
concealed
under
her
bed
the
idea
was
too
dreadful
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
her
what
was
she
to
do
she
did
not
dare
to
call
to
linda
she
felt
as
if
her
tongue
would
refuse
to
utter
a
cry
and
perhaps
if
she
did
the
man
would
at
once
crawl
out
the
room
was
not
quite
dark
as
a
fitful
moon
shone
in
through
the
blind
between
the
storm
clouds
and
to
poor
sylvia
it
made
the
horror
almost
worse
to
know
that
she
would
be
able
to
see
somebody
rise
up
suddenly
by
her
bedside
i
give
him
anything
and
everything
he
wants
to
steal
she
thought
if
only
he
would
frighten
me
so
oh
i
wonder
whether
he
really
there
or
not
she
held
the
edge
of
the
quilt
in
her
hand
was
it
slipping
once
more
yes
it
was
most
undoubtedly
being
pulled
from
her
grasp
and
as
her
hair
nearly
stood
on
end
with
fear
she
heard
an
unmistakable
sneeze
from
somewhere
just
underneath
her
bed
she
gave
a
little
agonized
gasp
of
terror
and
at
the
same
moment
something
sprang
up
and
plumped
on
to
her
chest
nearly
dead
with
fright
she
yet
managed
to
look
and
to
her
astonishment
beheld
only
the
waving
tail
and
round
green
eyes
of
toby
the
school
cat
which
settling
himself
comfortably
began
to
claw
the
quilt
with
his
paws
purring
his
loudest
the
while
as
if
quite
proud
and
pleased
with
himself
sylvia
sat
up
in
bed
and
laughed
heartily
at
her
burglar
toby
you
wretch
she
cried
stroking
his
soft
fur
how
did
you
manage
to
get
in
here
i
suppose
it
was
you
that
was
trying
to
tug
my
quilt
from
me
no
doubt
you
wanted
to
make
yourself
a
nice
bed
on
the
floor
and
then
you
sneezed
what
shall
i
do
with
you
i
ca
take
you
to
the
kitchen
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
have
to
cuddle
down
with
me
you
beautifully
warm
at
any
rate
here
come
inside
you
be
as
good
as
a
hot
bottle
and
clasping
the
purring
cat
close
in
her
arms
she
was
soon
back
in
the
land
of
dreams
it
was
quite
a
little
adventure
to
relate
to
linda
next
morning
and
the
latter
wondered
how
she
had
been
able
to
sleep
so
stolidly
through
it
you
always
say
i
should
hear
either
a
burglar
or
an
earthquake
she
declared
and
toby
was
very
nearly
as
bad
you
naughty
precious
puss
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
and
scaring
my
sylvia
there
you
did
do
it
on
purpose
did
you
come
into
my
bed
for
a
minute
before
i
get
up
you
the
sweetest
softest
darling
that
ever
was
sylvia
birthday
was
on
the
nineteenth
of
november
and
to
her
great
delight
it
happened
this
year
on
a
saturday
miss
kaye
who
tried
to
make
school
seem
as
much
like
home
as
possible
was
indulgent
regarding
such
anniversaries
and
permitted
many
small
privileges
to
the
fortunate
owner
of
a
birthday
sylvia
was
allowed
to
choose
the
dinner
an
important
decision
over
which
she
lingered
so
long
that
the
mistress
nearly
lost
patience
of
course
you
must
not
order
turkey
and
ice
cream
said
miss
kaye
it
must
be
two
of
our
ordinary
dishes
only
you
may
have
which
you
like
be
quick
for
cook
is
waiting
to
know
after
some
hesitation
sylvia
decided
on
hotpot
and
fig
pudding
i
like
the
potatoes
on
the
top
of
the
hotpot
she
explained
to
linda
especially
when
they
crisp
and
brown
and
the
fig
pudding
always
has
delicious
sweet
sauce
and
miss
kaye
lets
one
take
plenty
of
sugar
with
it
jessie
ellis
chose
boiled
mutton
and
blancmange
with
jam
on
her
birthday
i
do
think
that
was
nice
at
all
the
girls
in
her
class
subscribed
and
gave
sylvia
a
birthday
book
as
their
joint
present
containing
poetical
quotations
from
shakespeare
for
each
day
and
one
or
two
pretty
illustrations
of
perdita
portia
and
other
heroines
she
was
charmed
with
such
a
remembrance
and
asked
them
all
to
write
their
names
in
it
we
chose
a
fawn
cover
said
nina
because
topaz
is
the
birthday
stone
for
november
marian
wanted
a
green
one
but
i
said
that
would
do
it
a
funny
thing
but
people
always
say
your
month
stone
matches
your
eyes
i
never
can
quite
decide
whether
yours
are
brown
or
dark
grey
but
i
sure
a
necklace
of
topaz
would
suit
you
beautifully
and
you
have
to
wear
one
when
you
grown
up
by
the
by
on
which
day
of
the
week
were
you
born
on
a
friday
said
sylvia
but
why
do
you
want
to
know
then
you
loving
and
giving
what
do
you
mean
oh
do
you
know
the
old
rhyme
child
is
fair
of
face
tuesday
child
is
full
of
grace
wednesday
child
is
a
child
of
woe
thursday
child
has
far
to
go
friday
child
is
loving
and
giving
saturday
child
must
work
for
its
living
but
the
child
that
is
born
on
the
sabbath
day
is
good
and
truthful
and
happy
and
gay
where
do
you
learn
all
these
things
asked
sylvia
from
our
old
cook
she
a
daleswoman
and
she
can
tell
what
it
means
when
the
candle
gutters
or
the
clock
stops
or
a
swarm
of
bees
comes
or
you
see
magpies
or
your
ear
burns
or
you
sneeze
and
what
lucky
to
do
and
what
unlucky
you
are
the
greatest
goose
said
marian
scornfully
you
do
mean
to
say
you
believe
that
silly
rubbish
we
should
be
allowed
to
talk
to
our
cook
at
home
if
she
told
us
such
nonsense
you
better
not
let
miss
kaye
see
you
throwing
salt
over
your
shoulder
or
crossing
the
water
when
you
wash
with
anybody
you
always
make
fun
of
everything
i
do
exclaimed
nina
plaintively
then
you
should
have
more
sense
snapped
marian
who
prided
herself
upon
being
sylvia
has
a
pretty
name
at
any
rate
continued
nina
and
so
have
i
should
like
to
be
called
marian
it
just
like
mary
ann
but
as
marian
wisely
took
no
notice
and
walked
away
the
shot
fell
rather
flat
the
parcel
post
came
in
at
ten
and
brought
several
packages
addressed
to
miss
lindsay
sylvia
bore
them
off
to
the
playroom
and
untied
the
strings
before
an
audience
of
sympathetic
girls
each
of
whom
was
almost
as
interested
as
if
the
birthday
had
been
her
own
which
shall
i
open
first
she
said
this
one
feels
nice
and
in
mother
writing
too
lend
me
your
scissors
marian
that
a
dear
i
ca
unfasten
this
knot
oh
look
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
she
drew
from
a
cardboard
box
a
charming
little
brownie
camera
with
several
rolls
of
films
quite
ready
to
use
how
delightful
she
cried
now
i
can
take
snapshots
of
you
all
and
the
house
and
miss
kaye
and
everything
i
send
them
home
to
father
to
develop
he
very
clever
at
photos
you
wo
be
able
to
take
snaps
in
this
dark
weather
said
hazel
i
do
expect
you
can
do
much
with
it
until
spring
i
took
some
last
autumn
and
they
were
so
faint
you
could
tell
what
they
were
meant
for
well
she
can
try
at
any
rate
said
linda
perhaps
she
can
manage
a
time
exposure
if
she
puts
the
camera
on
something
steady
and
get
a
group
of
the
whole
class
in
the
garden
what
in
the
next
parcel
it
proved
to
be
a
copy
of
the
with
sylvia
lindsay
from
her
loving
father
written
inside
a
welcome
present
as
sylvia
was
collecting
scott
and
was
glad
to
have
an
addition
to
her
number
of
volumes
this
is
a
child
writing
said
marian
taking
up
a
small
packet
addressed
in
a
round
rather
hand
shall
i
cut
the
string
for
you
really
marian
let
her
open
her
own
parcels
they
her
presents
said
linda
and
my
scissors
returned
marian
i
only
wanted
to
help
her
oh
that
pretty
she
exclaimed
as
sylvia
unwrapped
a
purse
made
of
with
a
gilt
clasp
and
lined
with
crimson
silk
on
a
of
notepaper
was
written
with
best
wishes
for
your
birthday
from
effie
and
may
how
kind
of
them
to
send
me
anything
said
sylvia
they
never
have
done
before
i
suppose
it
because
i
at
school
i
really
am
in
luck
this
time
the
next
parcel
was
from
aunt
louisa
and
cousin
cuthbert
it
was
an
upright
wooden
box
containing
a
set
of
table
croquet
eight
little
mallets
and
balls
with
hoops
and
sticks
arranged
on
a
polished
wood
stand
and
sandbags
to
place
round
the
table
to
prevent
the
balls
from
rolling
off
on
to
the
floor
i
think
this
is
the
nicest
of
all
cried
linda
there
are
just
eight
mallets
so
that
the
whole
class
can
play
and
it
will
be
such
fun
on
wet
days
when
we
ca
go
out
i
never
expected
another
present
from
aunt
louisa
said
sylvia
she
gave
me
that
writing
case
when
i
came
and
cuthbert
the
pencil
box
the
one
i
gave
to
sadie
thompson
you
know
i
wish
she
were
my
aunt
said
marian
i
should
think
she
nice
she
is
generally
but
it
was
she
who
made
father
and
mother
send
me
here
and
i
did
want
to
come
in
the
least
why
but
you
glad
now
are
you
everybody
likes
being
at
miss
kaye
yes
i
very
glad
though
i
looking
forward
immensely
to
christmas
and
going
home
i
wonder
what
inside
this
smallest
parcel
oh
a
brooch
from
aunt
mabel
and
uncle
herbert
such
a
pretty
one
like
little
silver
daisies
it
will
go
beautifully
with
my
best
dress
miss
holt
had
sent
a
writing
album
granny
a
bottle
of
scent
and
uncle
wallace
a
box
of
chocolates
so
there
was
quite
a
show
of
gifts
arranged
upon
the
table
you
have
opened
this
one
yet
said
linda
pointing
to
the
largest
parcel
which
had
been
left
till
the
last
no
because
i
knew
what
it
was
said
sylvia
it
my
birthday
cake
and
mother
said
it
was
to
be
a
present
for
the
whole
school
it
was
so
carefully
packed
in
a
wooden
box
that
the
children
were
not
able
to
open
it
themselves
and
were
obliged
to
fetch
miss
coleman
who
prised
up
the
lid
with
a
screwdriver
and
lifted
out
such
a
wonderful
cake
that
as
she
laid
it
on
a
plate
everybody
gave
a
gasping
oh
of
admiration
it
was
beautifully
iced
with
ornaments
of
pink
and
white
sugar
and
sylvia
name
in
sugary
letters
on
the
top
and
it
was
of
such
a
large
and
substantial
size
that
it
looked
as
if
even
girls
would
be
able
to
cut
and
come
again
mother
says
there
a
sixpence
inside
said
sylvia
so
it
will
be
very
exciting
to
see
who
gets
it
at
tea
i
hope
it
will
be
right
in
the
middle
of
a
slice
and
not
tumble
out
just
when
it
being
cut
you
a
very
fortunate
girl
said
miss
coleman
you
have
to
be
quite
busy
the
rest
of
the
day
writing
letters
to
thank
all
these
kind
friends
i
going
to
take
the
cake
to
the
storeroom
but
you
may
keep
the
box
of
chocolates
tea
was
a
festive
meal
the
cake
looked
most
imposing
placed
on
one
of
miss
kaye
largest
dessert
dishes
in
the
centre
of
the
table
sylvia
was
allowed
to
cut
it
herself
and
handed
generous
slices
round
to
everybody
and
she
was
particularly
glad
when
little
elsie
thompson
got
the
coveted
sixpence
they
never
have
a
cake
of
their
own
whispered
linda
their
aunt
does
think
of
making
one
for
them
and
their
father
is
too
far
away
sadie
had
only
one
present
on
her
birthday
besides
what
we
gave
her
before
bedtime
came
sylvia
took
her
handsome
bottle
of
scent
and
wrapping
it
in
a
parcel
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
will
you
please
accept
this
from
me
i
shall
feel
very
hurt
if
you
do
then
in
defiance
of
rules
she
ran
into
mercy
room
and
laid
it
on
her
pillow
where
she
would
find
it
when
she
went
to
bed
i
sure
granny
would
mind
she
said
to
herself
no
one
knows
exactly
which
day
is
mercy
birthday
and
though
they
keep
it
on
the
one
when
she
was
found
it
might
perhaps
be
and
i
bear
to
think
that
i
had
all
these
lovely
presents
and
she
should
have
got
nothing
at
all
chapter
xi
the
christmas
holidays
sunday
seemed
to
come
almost
directly
after
birthday
and
the
girls
began
to
count
the
weeks
eagerly
until
the
holidays
there
were
many
ingenious
devices
for
marking
the
passage
of
time
hazel
prestbury
cut
notches
on
her
ruler
connie
camden
put
stones
on
her
mantelpiece
and
threw
one
out
of
the
window
every
morning
and
nina
forster
scored
the
calendar
hanging
in
her
bedroom
each
evening
with
a
very
black
lead
pencil
i
live
only
ten
miles
away
said
linda
so
i
have
a
long
journey
have
i
the
first
term
i
used
to
go
home
for
weekends
but
miss
kaye
said
it
unsettled
me
and
she
asked
mother
to
let
me
stay
at
school
like
the
other
girls
i
do
mind
it
now
it
rather
nice
here
on
saturdays
and
sundays
there
still
seemed
a
good
deal
to
be
done
before
the
end
of
the
term
arrived
all
the
girls
had
been
working
in
the
evenings
at
dressing
dolls
and
making
other
presents
for
a
christmas
tree
that
was
to
be
given
to
the
poor
children
attending
a
ragged
school
at
aberglyn
they
liked
the
employment
especially
as
miss
kaye
would
come
sometimes
and
read
aloud
to
them
while
they
sewed
and
there
is
anybody
in
the
world
who
can
read
so
beautifully
as
miss
kaye
said
linda
when
i
was
at
harper
school
said
hazel
we
were
helped
to
make
christmas
presents
to
take
home
instead
of
doing
things
for
ragged
schools
i
worked
a
most
lovely
cloth
quite
proud
of
it
still
i
wish
we
did
that
here
i
do
said
marian
i
suppose
you
only
like
doing
things
for
yourself
it
was
for
myself
it
was
for
my
mother
how
nasty
you
always
are
marian
it
was
for
home
at
any
rate
retorted
marian
miss
kaye
says
we
can
be
quite
as
selfish
for
our
families
as
for
ourselves
and
we
ought
to
remember
outside
people
at
christmas
who
do
get
any
presents
and
who
wo
give
us
nice
things
back
well
really
said
hazel
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
not
to
make
presents
for
my
mother
and
my
aunts
i
did
say
anything
of
the
sort
you
can
give
those
too
but
miss
kaye
said
they
ought
to
be
the
only
ones
even
heathens
are
fond
of
their
own
families
and
it
not
particularly
generous
just
for
all
to
give
things
round
in
a
circle
well
we
done
plenty
for
the
ragged
schools
this
year
said
nina
reviewing
the
row
of
dolls
in
their
pretty
bright
frocks
the
wool
balls
the
knitted
reins
and
the
scrapbooks
which
formed
the
contribution
of
the
class
they
look
splendid
hanging
on
the
tree
i
wish
we
could
go
and
see
the
treat
said
sylvia
miss
kaye
wo
let
us
do
that
replied
linda
she
afraid
we
might
catch
measles
or
i
always
go
to
our
treats
at
home
said
jessie
ellis
your
father
a
clergyman
so
you
sure
to
said
marian
we
do
sometimes
to
the
scholars
tea
or
the
congregational
teaparty
gwennie
and
i
help
to
pass
cups
and
hand
the
cake
while
mother
pours
out
let
us
tell
what
we
each
going
to
do
in
the
holidays
said
hazel
you
go
on
marian
as
you
begun
do
you
have
anything
but
school
treats
of
course
we
do
answered
marian
we
go
on
new
year
eve
to
our
grandfather
and
have
a
big
family
party
with
all
our
cousins
everybody
has
to
play
a
piece
or
recite
poetry
or
do
something
and
it
ever
so
jolly
we
sit
up
till
midnight
and
bring
in
the
new
year
and
we
go
skating
with
our
brothers
and
slide
on
the
pond
and
if
there
any
snow
we
toboggan
down
the
hill
on
teatrays
and
have
snowball
fights
with
some
boys
who
live
near
it
great
fun
yes
lovely
fun
echoed
gwennie
i
go
to
so
many
parties
said
hazel
i
always
have
three
or
four
a
week
and
we
give
a
dance
ourselves
too
last
year
i
went
to
the
mayor
children
fancy
ball
i
was
dressed
as
a
dresden
china
shepherdess
with
a
flowered
skirt
and
a
laced
bodice
and
paniers
and
a
big
hat
and
a
crook
in
my
hand
it
only
to
be
a
plain
ball
this
christmas
then
there
are
the
pantomimes
we
generally
go
to
two
and
sometimes
to
the
circus
as
well
and
any
concerts
or
entertainments
that
may
happen
to
be
on
now
connie
it
your
turn
to
say
there
are
so
many
of
us
began
connie
mother
says
it
like
a
party
to
see
us
all
sitting
round
the
table
we
play
games
amongst
ourselves
and
get
up
acts
and
charades
we
have
a
huge
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
we
may
make
as
much
noise
and
mess
as
we
like
sometimes
the
boys
give
a
show
up
there
or
make
shadow
pictures
and
bertie
has
a
lathe
and
turns
all
kinds
of
jolly
things
in
it
out
of
pieces
of
wood
and
he
helps
us
to
build
boats
and
we
sail
them
across
the
reservoir
and
we
go
long
walks
on
the
moors
and
we
a
little
hut
at
the
end
of
the
garden
with
a
stove
in
it
where
we
cook
things
we
make
the
most
glorious
toffee
i
would
change
my
holidays
for
anybody
else
they
do
sound
nice
said
nina
i
go
about
with
my
sisters
quite
grown
up
and
they
take
me
to
pay
calls
then
my
brother
at
home
as
well
and
he
and
i
have
fun
together
i
asked
to
plenty
of
parties
but
mother
is
so
terribly
afraid
of
my
catching
cold
that
i
miss
quite
half
of
them
i
do
always
go
to
the
pantomime
because
of
draughts
i
like
the
summer
holidays
best
when
we
stay
at
the
seaside
jessie
you
have
said
yet
i
do
know
what
to
tell
said
jessie
who
was
not
gifted
with
great
powers
of
description
oh
but
you
must
say
something
i
do
suppose
you
spend
the
holidays
in
bed
well
no
said
jessie
laughing
though
i
did
once
when
i
had
scarlet
fever
i
go
walks
with
my
brother
and
we
help
to
decorate
the
church
and
people
ask
us
to
tea
i
think
that
all
i
still
think
mine
are
the
nicest
said
hazel
linda
we
want
yours
we
live
quite
in
the
country
said
linda
the
carol
singers
come
on
christmas
eve
and
we
ask
them
in
and
give
them
hot
coffee
there
a
big
pond
where
we
skate
if
it
freezes
hard
enough
and
once
when
there
was
very
deep
snow
we
had
out
our
sledge
sometimes
we
stay
with
granny
in
london
and
then
we
go
to
the
pantomime
and
the
circus
and
have
a
lovely
time
we
got
a
new
puppy
and
i
want
to
teach
him
some
tricks
these
holidays
now
sylvia
you
the
last
i
nobody
to
do
anything
with
said
sylvia
rather
wistfully
almost
forgetting
in
listening
to
the
glowing
accounts
of
the
others
how
she
had
once
said
she
did
not
wish
for
young
companions
not
at
home
at
any
rate
but
of
course
there
are
parties
and
we
have
people
to
tea
i
just
read
and
paint
and
do
things
by
myself
the
girls
appeared
to
consider
this
must
be
very
slow
and
pitied
sylvia
to
such
an
extent
that
she
was
quite
surprised
i
perfectly
happy
she
remonstrated
but
it
ca
be
so
nice
as
having
brothers
and
sisters
said
marian
in
her
decisive
manner
i
should
miss
our
little
ones
most
dreadfully
and
fred
and
larry
too
holidays
would
be
holidays
without
seeing
them
i
think
it
must
be
wretched
to
be
an
only
child
talking
of
the
holidays
did
not
make
them
come
any
the
faster
and
there
was
plenty
of
hard
work
to
be
gone
through
before
the
end
of
the
term
arrived
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
sylvia
had
real
examinations
she
rather
enjoyed
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
the
typed
questions
the
large
sheets
of
lined
paper
with
margins
ruled
in
red
ink
the
clean
blotting
paper
the
new
pens
and
even
the
awesome
silence
of
the
room
with
miss
arkwright
sitting
at
her
desk
reading
instead
of
teaching
as
usual
she
came
out
top
in
history
grammar
and
geography
but
marian
beat
her
easily
in
french
writing
and
arithmetic
and
in
the
end
their
marks
were
so
exactly
even
that
they
were
bracketed
together
then
there
was
an
agitating
afternoon
when
everybody
had
to
recite
poetry
to
miss
kaye
each
being
expected
to
choose
a
different
piece
sylvia
selected
john
gilpin
which
she
had
learnt
with
miss
holt
but
unfortunately
grew
nervous
and
got
so
mixed
that
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
in
confusion
and
hear
marian
sail
glibly
through
the
little
quaker
maiden
a
poem
which
she
rendered
with
great
effect
connie
camden
and
jessie
ellis
had
a
furious
quarrel
as
to
which
should
say
hohenlinden
that
being
the
shortest
on
the
list
of
both
but
in
the
end
jessie
gave
way
and
took
the
may
queen
instead
miss
denby
did
not
allow
the
music
to
be
neglected
and
made
each
pupil
learn
a
grand
christmas
piece
which
seemed
to
need
much
more
practising
than
any
other
and
had
the
added
ordeal
that
it
must
be
played
on
the
last
day
before
an
audience
of
the
whole
school
the
party
which
was
always
held
on
the
saturday
before
was
also
a
new
experience
to
sylvia
the
first
class
acted
a
short
french
play
under
the
excited
direction
of
mademoiselle
who
had
spent
much
time
in
coaching
them
for
their
parts
the
second
class
took
a
scene
from
trissie
knowles
made
a
pretty
titania
and
stella
camden
such
a
mischievous
puck
that
everybody
clapped
heartily
though
miss
barrett
said
she
was
only
acting
her
natural
character
and
of
course
it
came
easily
to
her
connie
camden
climbed
up
and
sat
on
the
window
sill
in
order
to
see
better
and
fell
down
with
a
terrible
crash
grazing
her
knee
on
a
form
and
making
a
big
bump
on
her
forehead
and
dolly
managed
to
upset
a
bottle
of
ink
which
miss
coleman
thought
she
had
put
most
securely
away
when
the
plays
were
over
the
girls
had
dancing
and
games
in
the
large
classroom
and
finished
with
a
dainty
supper
of
fruit
cake
and
jellies
which
fully
justified
linda
remark
that
heathercliffe
house
seemed
almost
as
much
parties
as
school
then
came
the
exciting
afternoon
when
the
boxes
were
carried
down
from
the
boxroom
and
everybody
set
to
work
to
pack
with
the
help
of
the
monitresses
and
miss
coleman
it
was
a
most
delightful
noisy
blissful
time
when
there
were
no
forfeits
if
one
ran
into
anybody
else
room
or
even
jumped
on
the
bed
when
nobody
had
to
practise
or
learn
lessons
and
one
could
shout
and
sing
in
the
schoolroom
connie
camden
flung
her
history
up
to
the
ceiling
and
did
not
mind
in
the
least
when
it
lost
its
back
in
its
descent
miss
arkwright
will
be
dreadfully
cross
about
it
when
we
begin
history
again
said
marian
i
do
care
that
a
whole
month
off
and
we
all
the
holidays
first
no
school
for
four
weeks
and
going
home
hooray
shouted
connie
at
the
pitch
of
her
lungs
waltzing
among
the
desks
with
such
vigour
that
she
knocked
over
the
blackboard
and
got
a
scolding
after
all
from
miss
arkwright
who
happened
at
that
moment
to
enter
the
room
you
must
control
yourself
connie
i
ca
have
such
wild
behaviour
even
if
it
is
the
last
day
she
said
firmly
oh
miss
arkwright
cried
connie
you
ca
want
to
go
home
half
as
badly
as
i
do
indeed
i
do
said
the
mistress
i
shall
enjoy
my
holidays
quite
as
much
as
anybody
though
i
have
learnt
not
to
dance
round
the
desks
to
show
my
pleasure
the
girls
laughed
the
idea
of
miss
arkwright
executing
a
highland
fling
or
a
jig
between
the
forms
tickled
their
fancy
i
could
imagine
miss
kaye
doing
it
easier
than
miss
arkwright
whispered
linda
she
did
dance
a
reel
you
know
at
the
party
everybody
got
into
bed
that
night
with
the
happy
feeling
that
boxes
were
packed
and
ready
and
that
morning
when
the
last
necessaries
were
popped
in
they
would
only
need
to
be
strapped
and
labelled
and
then
the
joyful
opening
would
be
at
home
most
of
the
girls
were
too
excited
to
eat
much
breakfast
but
miss
kaye
knowing
a
reaction
would
probably
take
place
in
the
train
had
provided
packets
of
sandwiches
and
biscuits
and
did
not
scold
for
once
at
the
plates
of
porridge
at
ten
cabs
began
to
drive
up
to
the
door
and
parties
of
chattering
laughing
girls
departed
to
the
railway
station
under
the
care
of
miss
barrett
sylvia
had
enquired
anxiously
some
time
ago
if
mercy
were
to
stay
at
school
having
a
secret
hope
that
she
might
persuade
her
mother
to
ask
her
friend
home
with
her
but
may
spencer
had
already
given
an
invitation
which
miss
kaye
had
allowed
mercy
to
accept
linda
parents
drove
over
to
fetch
her
so
sylvia
had
the
pleasure
of
making
their
acquaintance
there
was
not
time
to
do
much
more
than
shake
hands
still
it
was
nice
to
see
the
father
and
mother
of
whom
linda
had
spoken
so
often
and
hear
them
express
a
wish
that
she
should
some
day
pay
a
visit
to
craigwen
sylvia
was
to
travel
with
miss
coleman
who
would
pass
through
crewe
where
lindsay
had
arranged
to
meet
her
and
she
had
the
four
camdens
and
sadie
and
elsie
thompson
as
companions
for
part
of
the
way
the
camdens
were
welcomed
at
a
wayside
station
by
a
jolly
crew
of
brothers
who
appeared
to
have
reached
home
first
and
the
thompsons
were
handed
over
at
chester
to
a
aunt
who
did
not
look
particularly
pleased
to
receive
them
and
remarked
at
once
how
fast
they
had
worn
out
their
clothes
i
wish
i
could
have
taken
them
home
with
me
poor
little
dears
said
miss
coleman
afterwards
in
the
train
but
my
sister
is
ill
and
could
not
do
with
any
noise
perhaps
their
aunt
may
brighten
up
more
at
christmas
and
remember
that
she
too
was
once
a
child
and
then
we
must
see
what
can
be
managed
for
them
at
easter
at
last
came
the
arrival
at
crewe
the
anxious
search
among
the
crowd
in
the
station
and
the
joyful
sight
of
not
only
mother
but
her
father
also
hurrying
along
the
platform
she
hugged
them
both
as
if
she
had
not
seen
them
for
years
instead
of
eleven
weeks
my
precious
child
exclaimed
lindsay
i
declare
you
have
grown
and
are
ever
so
much
fatter
and
you
quite
a
colour
too
school
evidently
agrees
with
you
sylvia
said
her
father
it
a
good
thing
you
went
is
it
it
was
quite
different
from
what
i
thought
it
would
be
sylvia
confided
to
her
mother
when
they
sat
in
the
together
for
a
long
talk
after
tea
miss
kaye
is
cross
she
lovely
and
kind
and
even
miss
arkwright
is
bad
and
i
like
marian
better
than
i
did
and
i
just
love
linda
and
mercy
i
tried
to
explain
about
mercy
in
my
letters
but
i
afraid
you
did
exactly
understand
so
have
to
tell
it
you
over
again
and
marian
and
i
were
both
bracketed
together
top
and
miss
arkwright
said
we
must
be
friends
and
not
rivals
and
i
quite
forgot
the
middle
of
john
gilpin
and
made
a
horrible
mistake
in
my
christmas
piece
but
miss
kaye
said
i
might
tell
you
that
she
thought
i
had
done
very
well
but
my
report
will
come
in
a
day
or
two
so
then
you
can
see
everything
for
yourself
sylvia
had
a
particularly
happy
holiday
and
thought
she
enjoyed
home
twice
as
much
with
having
been
away
from
it
for
a
whole
term
her
father
found
time
to
label
the
specimens
in
her
museum
and
to
show
her
how
to
develop
her
photographs
and
print
them
afterwards
and
her
mother
gave
up
the
afternoons
specially
to
be
with
her
all
her
friends
came
to
her
new
year
party
and
to
her
astonishment
she
found
she
got
on
perfectly
well
with
the
fergusson
boys
who
now
seemed
hardly
more
lively
than
connie
or
stella
camden
and
who
did
not
tease
her
since
as
they
described
it
she
had
left
off
putting
on
airs
her
experiences
with
the
little
ones
at
school
made
her
quite
motherly
with
bab
and
daisy
carson
and
she
enjoyed
the
games
with
effie
and
may
as
much
as
they
did
you
said
you
would
care
to
run
about
when
you
came
back
they
reminded
her
but
you
play
more
with
us
now
than
you
did
before
i
believe
sylvia
has
learnt
it
as
part
of
her
lessons
said
aunt
louisa
who
looked
on
with
much
approval
adding
quietly
to
lindsay
the
child
is
immensely
improved
she
is
brighter
and
stronger
and
better
in
every
way
i
was
sure
miss
kaye
would
soon
work
a
change
and
i
think
we
may
feel
that
so
far
our
experiment
has
been
a
complete
success
chapter
xii
the
secret
society
school
on
january
and
sylvia
found
herself
driving
up
to
the
door
with
very
different
feelings
from
those
she
had
experienced
on
her
first
arrival
there
on
the
whole
she
was
quite
pleased
to
be
back
again
to
meet
all
her
friends
and
compare
notes
about
the
holidays
there
was
one
change
in
the
third
class
which
however
it
might
affect
others
seemed
to
sylvia
a
decided
improvement
hazel
prestbury
had
left
an
aunt
residing
in
paris
had
offered
to
take
her
for
a
time
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
special
study
in
french
and
music
and
her
parents
had
arranged
for
her
to
go
at
once
sending
brenda
a
younger
sister
to
heathercliffe
house
in
her
place
brenda
was
a
very
different
child
from
hazel
and
had
soon
sworn
eternal
friendship
with
connie
camden
so
that
at
last
sylvia
felt
she
had
her
dear
linda
absolutely
and
entirely
to
herself
i
do
know
how
it
is
said
nina
one
chilly
february
evening
when
the
members
of
the
third
class
were
gathered
round
the
high
fireguard
in
the
playroom
there
never
seems
half
so
much
fun
going
on
in
the
spring
term
in
the
autumn
we
have
and
the
fifth
of
november
and
the
christmas
party
and
in
the
summer
there
are
picnics
and
the
shore
and
the
sports
and
the
but
unless
miss
kaye
takes
us
a
long
walk
there
is
anything
to
look
forward
to
now
until
easter
and
that
eleven
whole
weeks
off
groaned
connie
i
wish
it
had
come
early
this
year
it
would
make
any
difference
if
it
did
said
marian
miss
kaye
keeps
to
the
term
we
should
only
have
to
spend
easter
at
school
and
go
home
as
usual
in
the
middle
of
april
that
would
be
horrid
why
should
she
because
it
would
make
too
long
a
summer
term
and
because
she
likes
our
holidays
to
be
the
same
as
those
of
the
boys
schools
i
had
thought
of
that
of
course
it
would
be
no
fun
to
go
home
if
percy
and
frank
and
bertie
and
godfrey
were
there
still
i
wish
terms
were
a
little
shorter
or
that
something
nice
would
happen
and
connie
ruffled
up
her
hair
with
both
hands
as
an
expression
of
her
discontent
could
we
do
something
just
amongst
ourselves
said
sylvia
not
the
whole
school
but
our
class
there
is
anything
new
said
brenda
unless
someone
can
invent
a
fresh
game
we
getting
tired
of
table
croquet
i
do
mean
exactly
a
game
suppose
we
were
each
to
write
a
story
and
then
have
a
meeting
to
read
them
all
out
start
a
kind
of
magazine
said
marian
that
a
good
idea
we
could
put
our
tales
together
into
an
old
exercise
book
and
perhaps
paste
pictures
in
for
illustrations
and
make
up
puzzles
and
competitions
for
the
end
oh
yes
that
would
be
lovely
cried
the
others
like
folks
or
the
girl
but
look
here
said
linda
the
second
class
must
hear
a
word
about
it
they
only
make
dreadful
fun
of
us
and
it
will
be
ever
so
much
nicer
if
we
keep
it
a
secret
let
us
form
a
secret
society
then
suggested
sylvia
we
pinch
each
others
little
fingers
and
vow
we
wo
tell
a
soul
in
the
school
how
horridly
inquisitive
they
be
said
nina
all
the
more
fun
we
let
them
know
that
we
doing
something
enough
to
make
them
wildly
curious
but
they
sha
have
a
hint
of
what
it
is
and
they
imagine
the
most
ridiculous
things
and
then
we
can
just
laugh
at
them
and
say
they
quite
wrong
the
girls
agreed
cordially
with
sylvia
scheme
and
the
society
was
formed
on
the
spot
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
as
to
a
suitable
name
linda
thought
of
the
heathercliffe
magaziners
but
nina
said
that
was
tame
and
that
moreover
magaziners
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
dictionary
of
the
english
language
connie
considered
the
you
like
to
know
club
might
be
appropriate
but
nobody
approved
of
her
title
at
last
marian
who
was
fond
of
long
names
suggested
the
secret
society
of
literary
undertakings
which
was
carried
unanimously
by
the
others
marian
was
elected
president
and
sylvia
secretary
and
the
latter
at
once
devoted
a
new
notebook
to
writing
the
names
of
the
members
and
the
rules
of
the
association
we
must
have
rules
said
marian
even
if
we
do
always
quite
keep
them
you
have
to
hide
the
book
away
most
carefully
sylvia
for
fear
any
of
the
second
class
get
hold
of
it
it
took
a
long
time
to
think
of
sufficiently
strict
and
binding
regulations
but
at
length
they
decided
upon
the
following
this
society
is
to
be
called
the
secret
society
of
literary
undertakings
and
it
can
be
known
for
short
as
the
each
member
pledges
herself
that
she
will
never
tell
a
word
of
what
goes
on
in
it
any
member
who
tells
anything
will
never
be
spoken
to
again
by
the
rest
of
the
class
there
is
to
be
a
weekly
magazine
every
member
must
write
something
for
it
even
if
a
member
says
she
can
not
write
anything
she
will
have
to
try
if
she
does
not
try
she
will
be
expelled
from
the
society
the
meetings
are
to
be
held
in
the
playroom
after
the
fourth
class
has
gone
to
bed
any
member
who
is
expelled
will
have
to
stay
outside
in
the
passage
during
the
meetings
all
members
are
requested
to
write
as
clearly
as
they
can
the
secretary
is
to
arrange
the
magazine
the
president
is
to
read
it
out
at
the
weekly
meeting
as
nina
had
prophesied
the
aroused
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
among
the
second
class
which
while
it
affected
to
look
down
upon
the
third
was
nevertheless
rather
interested
in
what
was
going
on
there
being
permitted
to
know
the
initials
though
not
the
full
name
the
elder
girls
promptly
added
a
g
and
christened
the
members
the
slugs
a
title
which
stuck
to
them
long
after
the
society
was
abandoned
it
was
most
difficult
to
preserve
the
secret
from
the
little
ones
who
shared
the
playroom
but
by
instituting
a
series
of
private
signs
and
signals
they
managed
to
keep
up
the
mystery
and
obtain
a
great
amount
of
enjoyment
out
of
the
matter
brenda
prestbury
covered
herself
with
glory
by
recalling
the
alphabet
the
various
letters
of
which
she
had
learnt
at
home
and
now
taught
to
the
others
who
were
soon
able
to
talk
on
their
fingers
a
rather
slow
method
of
conversation
but
delightful
when
they
felt
that
nobody
but
a
member
could
understand
unfortunately
they
carried
their
accomplishment
somewhat
too
far
one
day
connie
seated
at
her
drawing
board
in
the
studio
began
signalling
an
interesting
remark
to
linda
who
was
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
linda
was
in
the
middle
of
her
reply
when
dawson
the
visiting
master
suddenly
cleared
his
throat
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
young
ladies
he
said
nervously
that
i
am
very
well
acquainted
with
the
alphabet
having
taught
the
subject
for
several
years
at
an
institution
for
connie
went
extremely
red
as
well
she
might
for
she
had
asked
linda
where
dawson
got
the
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
if
miss
coleman
had
given
it
to
him
the
girls
never
ventured
after
that
to
try
talking
in
the
drawing
class
though
they
did
a
little
surreptitiously
during
dancing
the
first
grand
meeting
of
the
society
was
felt
to
be
an
occasion
of
great
importance
the
playroom
door
was
carefully
shut
after
ascertaining
that
no
one
was
in
the
passage
and
brenda
even
peeped
under
the
table
and
behind
the
window
curtains
to
make
quite
sure
that
none
of
the
second
class
were
concealed
there
at
last
considering
themselves
secure
the
magazine
was
produced
by
the
secretary
and
handed
to
the
president
who
according
to
the
rules
was
to
read
it
aloud
from
beginning
to
end
it
was
written
on
sheets
of
paper
torn
from
exercise
books
stitched
together
inside
an
old
arithmetic
cover
the
back
of
which
had
been
adorned
with
scraps
and
transfers
and
printed
on
a
school
label
and
gummed
in
the
middle
the
idea
of
illustrations
had
to
be
abandoned
because
nobody
had
any
magazines
which
they
would
spare
to
be
cut
up
neither
did
anybody
talent
rise
to
the
pitch
of
original
drawings
but
on
the
whole
that
did
not
much
matter
it
stories
we
want
not
pictures
said
marian
settling
herself
on
the
seat
of
honour
with
a
piece
of
toffee
handy
in
case
her
throat
grew
troublesome
through
her
arduous
duties
the
first
on
the
list
she
began
is
the
knight
vengeance
a
story
in
two
parts
by
nina
millicent
forster
author
of
baron
secret
mystery
of
the
castle
part
i
the
forest
was
dark
and
gloomy
as
sir
brian
de
fotheringay
rode
along
on
his
superb
white
charger
carrying
his
shield
in
one
hand
and
his
sword
in
the
other
how
did
he
manage
to
hold
the
reins
enquired
connie
camden
you
mus
interrupt
said
marian
perhaps
he
held
them
bunched
up
with
the
sword
no
that
would
be
the
wrong
hand
would
it
the
horse
knew
its
own
way
explained
nina
but
if
connie
going
to
find
fault
with
everything
one
puts
she
sha
said
marian
hastily
nobody
to
make
any
remarks
till
the
end
of
the
story
now
i
going
on
his
undaunted
spirit
heeded
little
the
perils
of
his
path
and
as
the
moonlight
flashed
on
his
steel
helmet
he
bade
defiance
to
all
his
foes
in
front
of
him
stood
the
castle
its
tall
towers
strongly
guarded
by
a
force
of
armed
men
the
drawbridge
was
up
and
the
portcullis
was
down
but
dangers
were
welcome
to
sir
brian
de
fotheringay
for
they
did
but
prove
how
much
he
could
accomplish
for
the
sake
of
his
lady
love
she
stood
at
the
turret
window
the
beautiful
lady
guinevere
de
montmorency
the
greatest
heiress
in
the
land
leaving
his
charger
on
the
bank
he
swam
the
moat
and
flinging
a
rope
ladder
up
to
her
window
he
begged
her
to
fly
with
him
for
thee
would
i
dare
all
she
replied
but
before
she
could
say
more
a
stern
figure
in
armour
appeared
in
the
turret
behind
her
and
seized
her
by
her
flowing
golden
locks
it
was
her
angry
father
he
cried
sir
brian
ere
i
kill
thee
you
lady
will
be
immured
in
the
dungeon
until
you
have
promised
to
wed
lord
vivian
de
fitz
bracy
the
suitor
of
my
choice
with
a
shriek
she
disappeared
from
the
view
of
her
despairing
knight
part
ii
determined
to
save
his
lady
love
from
so
terrible
a
fate
sir
brian
de
fotheringay
collected
all
his
retainers
together
with
a
band
of
outlaws
to
whom
he
had
rendered
some
services
and
who
had
promised
to
assist
him
in
time
of
need
uttering
his
warcry
they
rushed
at
the
castle
the
portcullis
gave
way
before
their
furious
attack
and
the
archers
were
slain
at
their
posts
thee
sir
guy
de
montmorency
cried
sir
brian
waving
his
invincible
sword
shouted
the
baron
but
it
was
his
last
word
for
sir
brian
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
he
had
soon
forced
open
the
dungeon
and
released
the
beautiful
lady
guinevere
the
castle
was
now
hers
so
they
were
married
without
delay
and
the
king
and
queen
themselves
came
to
the
wedding
it
perfectly
splendid
cried
the
girls
when
marian
had
finished
reading
nina
how
did
you
manage
to
think
of
it
oh
i
do
know
it
just
came
said
nina
modestly
i
rather
fond
of
making
up
tales
there
only
one
thing
said
connie
was
the
lady
rather
sorry
when
her
father
was
stabbed
to
the
heart
even
if
he
had
shut
her
up
in
a
dungeon
i
should
be
i
do
think
people
minded
in
the
middle
ages
said
nina
you
see
somebody
had
to
get
killed
and
she
liked
the
knight
best
but
her
own
father
objected
connie
i
going
to
read
the
next
one
now
said
marian
who
as
president
felt
bound
to
keep
the
peace
i
think
nina
story
very
good
and
makes
a
capital
beginning
this
one
seems
much
shorter
it
called
most
haste
least
speed
by
gwendolen
woodhouse
matilda
jane
was
a
girl
who
was
always
in
a
hurry
one
day
her
grandmother
told
her
to
take
the
bucket
and
fetch
some
water
from
the
well
but
to
be
sure
to
tie
her
boot
lace
first
now
matilda
jane
wanted
to
be
very
quick
so
that
she
might
go
and
play
and
she
did
not
stop
to
tie
her
boot
lace
as
she
ran
out
of
the
door
she
tripped
over
it
and
fell
the
bucket
rolled
from
her
hand
and
hit
the
dog
the
dog
howled
and
made
the
geese
cackle
the
geese
cackling
made
the
pigs
grunt
the
pigs
grunting
frightened
the
hens
into
the
field
the
hens
frightened
the
cow
which
began
to
run
when
the
horse
saw
the
cow
running
it
ran
too
and
they
both
jumped
over
the
hedge
into
the
road
then
the
hens
flew
after
the
horse
and
the
cow
and
the
pigs
went
after
the
hens
and
the
geese
followed
the
pigs
and
the
dog
chased
the
geese
and
it
took
matilda
jane
and
her
grandmother
the
whole
afternoon
to
drive
them
back
and
all
because
she
had
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
tie
her
boot
lace
the
moral
of
this
tale
is
haste
least
speed
the
girls
laughed
i
do
generally
like
stories
with
a
moral
said
brenda
but
i
do
mind
this
one
at
any
rate
go
on
marian
the
next
is
a
piece
of
poetry
said
marian
the
kittens
chorus
by
sylvia
lindsay
miew
miew
miew
miew
we
want
to
catch
mice
we
do
we
do
but
our
mother
the
old
white
cat
says
we
are
rather
too
young
for
that
miew
miew
miew
miew
we
want
to
catch
flies
we
do
we
do
but
our
mother
says
that
if
we
do
it
we
grow
so
thin
that
we
soon
shall
rue
it
miew
miew
miew
miew
we
want
to
catch
mother
tail
we
do
but
she
says
she
is
not
such
a
common
cat
as
to
let
her
kits
be
so
pert
as
that
miew
miew
miew
miew
we
want
to
be
good
we
do
we
do
but
that
much
harder
to
do
than
to
say
so
we
think
about
that
another
day
the
poem
proved
so
popular
that
marian
had
to
read
it
over
again
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
class
had
heard
any
of
sylvia
effusions
and
they
were
quite
impressed
i
afraid
mine
will
seem
very
stupid
after
it
said
brenda
i
could
think
of
anything
to
write
but
i
was
obliged
to
put
something
the
title
sounds
interesting
said
marian
my
visit
to
france
by
brenda
prestbury
last
summer
mother
took
hazel
and
me
with
her
to
france
to
visit
aunt
cecily
who
was
staying
near
rouen
the
first
thing
we
saw
was
a
funny
old
woman
in
a
big
white
cap
like
a
large
poke
bonnet
and
wooden
shoes
on
her
feet
the
porters
all
wore
baggy
blue
blouses
something
like
pinafores
we
were
obliged
to
go
through
the
customs
a
man
in
a
uniform
was
looking
to
see
if
anybody
had
brought
any
tea
he
took
a
little
girl
doll
away
from
her
and
felt
it
to
see
if
it
had
any
tea
inside
it
then
he
took
a
lady
cushion
and
because
she
got
angry
he
stuck
his
sword
through
it
and
all
the
feathers
came
out
over
his
grand
coat
we
were
so
glad
there
were
no
carpets
in
the
house
where
aunt
cecily
was
living
the
floors
were
of
polished
wood
and
so
slippery
jean
the
servant
used
to
rub
them
with
beeswax
every
morning
but
he
was
very
cross
in
french
when
hazel
and
i
made
slides
on
them
we
used
to
have
coffee
and
lovely
little
rolls
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
then
proper
breakfast
at
eleven
and
we
had
quite
different
things
to
eat
from
what
you
get
in
england
one
day
hazel
and
i
went
such
a
long
walk
that
we
got
lost
and
we
could
remember
enough
french
to
ask
our
way
home
a
woman
came
along
with
a
donkey
and
two
big
baskets
on
it
and
when
she
saw
us
crying
she
gave
us
each
an
apple
and
took
us
to
the
curé
of
the
village
who
could
speak
english
he
was
very
kind
he
showed
us
round
his
garden
and
then
he
borrowed
a
cart
from
the
farmer
and
drove
us
home
to
aunt
cecily
this
is
all
i
can
tell
you
about
my
visit
to
france
i
know
it
horrid
said
brenda
but
i
really
ca
write
well
and
make
up
tales
like
nina
i
do
know
how
she
does
it
it
jolly
said
marian
we
none
of
us
been
to
france
so
we
like
to
hear
about
it
i
wish
you
had
written
more
the
next
very
short
indeed
the
lady
and
the
snake
by
jessie
ellis
a
lady
who
lived
in
australia
one
day
put
a
great
log
of
wood
on
to
the
fire
in
a
little
while
she
was
going
to
poke
it
and
she
stooped
to
pick
up
what
she
thought
was
the
poker
but
it
was
really
a
horrible
black
snake
which
coiled
at
once
round
her
arm
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
move
but
remained
very
still
and
in
a
few
moments
it
slid
down
on
to
the
ground
a
gentleman
who
was
in
the
room
killed
it
and
taking
the
log
from
the
fire
he
carried
it
into
the
yard
where
seven
more
snakes
dropped
out
of
it
the
wood
was
hollow
and
they
had
made
a
nest
inside
it
and
gone
to
sleep
and
the
warmth
of
the
fire
had
wakened
them
up
it
quite
true
said
jessie
the
lady
was
my
aunt
she
told
us
about
it
in
a
letter
what
a
horrid
thing
to
happen
cried
the
girls
a
nice
tale
but
too
short
commented
the
president
i
afraid
linda
has
written
a
long
one
either
the
story
of
a
dog
by
linda
acton
marshall
i
have
a
little
dog
called
scamp
that
follows
me
wherever
i
go
he
can
sit
up
and
beg
and
catch
biscuits
on
his
nose
and
do
all
kinds
of
tricks
one
day
i
was
in
bed
with
a
bad
cold
and
scamp
came
upstairs
to
my
room
i
told
him
i
was
ill
and
he
gave
a
sharp
bark
and
ran
out
i
could
hear
him
trot
up
to
the
attic
and
soon
he
returned
with
a
biscuit
in
his
mouth
and
laid
it
on
my
pillow
wagging
his
tail
and
looking
very
sorry
for
me
and
very
pleased
at
himself
he
must
have
kept
a
store
of
biscuits
in
the
attic
i
think
he
is
just
the
cleverest
little
dog
in
the
world
my
tale
true
too
said
linda
no
i
did
make
it
up
nina
he
really
did
there
are
only
two
stories
left
now
connie
and
marian
i
wonder
which
comes
next
connie
said
marian
and
it
in
poetry
too
it
called
the
by
constance
mary
camden
said
the
girls
of
the
third
class
we
a
secret
society
will
be
though
the
second
may
hover
our
words
to
discover
it
nothing
they
hear
or
they
see
they
may
listen
at
doors
in
the
hall
or
round
by
the
keyhole
may
crawl
they
may
search
through
the
schools
but
they
wo
find
our
rules
and
they
never
know
nothing
at
all
the
girls
clapped
both
at
the
sentiments
expressed
and
at
the
poetical
setting
i
know
they
listen
if
they
could
said
connie
they
mean
enough
for
anything
what
that
noise
why
nothing
i
thought
i
heard
a
kind
of
snorting
i
expect
it
was
only
my
cold
said
nina
do
go
on
marian
we
want
your
story
but
i
did
hear
something
persisted
connie
i
believe
it
was
outside
the
door
too
and
i
going
to
look
she
rose
hastily
and
creeping
softly
to
the
door
opened
it
suddenly
disclosing
the
laughing
faces
of
half
a
dozen
of
the
second
class
who
had
been
taking
it
in
turns
to
listen
at
the
keyhole
and
who
jumped
up
in
a
hurry
and
fled
from
the
outburst
of
wrath
which
greeted
them
oh
oh
shouted
sybil
lake
wo
they
hear
or
see
anything
make
too
sure
i
have
a
little
dog
that
swallows
me
wherever
i
go
called
eileen
butler
i
think
he
just
the
cleverest
little
dog
in
the
world
the
slugs
are
crawling
fast
cried
lucy
martin
the
injured
third
had
risen
in
a
body
and
pursued
the
intruders
along
the
passage
even
to
the
door
of
their
own
but
seeing
miss
barrett
coming
downstairs
they
did
not
dare
to
carry
the
fight
into
the
camp
and
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
playroom
and
hold
an
indignation
meeting
over
the
glasses
of
milk
and
biscuits
which
arrived
at
that
moment
for
supper
we
must
read
marian
story
said
sylvia
was
it
horrid
of
them
i
wonder
how
much
they
really
heard
next
time
we
shall
have
to
stuff
up
the
keyhole
and
keep
opening
the
door
every
few
minutes
to
see
that
the
coast
is
clear
there
one
good
thing
they
did
discover
our
signs
or
the
password
and
they
have
hard
work
to
find
the
rules
because
the
book
hidden
under
the
oilcloth
in
the
corner
by
the
piano
only
be
sure
and
do
let
the
little
ones
know
because
i
do
believe
there
one
of
them
that
can
keep
a
secret
chapter
xiii
a
spring
picnic
the
beginning
of
march
brought
such
delightful
mild
balmy
weather
that
winter
seemed
to
have
gathered
her
chilly
garments
together
and
said
the
month
came
in
like
a
lamb
and
though
it
would
probably
justify
the
old
proverb
by
going
out
like
a
lion
in
the
meantime
the
sunshine
was
pleasant
and
everyone
enjoyed
the
foretaste
of
spring
miss
kaye
never
slow
to
take
advantage
of
the
bright
days
announced
one
saturday
at
that
the
girls
might
put
on
their
thickest
boots
and
prepare
for
a
ramble
up
the
hills
we
will
start
at
once
she
said
to
get
the
best
of
the
morning
and
carry
sandwiches
in
our
pockets
then
we
can
return
here
for
tea
at
four
the
expedition
was
considered
too
far
for
the
little
ones
but
the
third
class
was
of
course
included
and
all
its
eight
members
set
off
in
wild
spirits
though
sylvia
was
in
her
second
term
at
heathercliffe
house
she
had
not
seen
much
of
the
beautiful
country
in
the
neighbourhood
the
weather
in
the
autumn
had
been
too
damp
for
picnics
and
they
had
only
gone
walks
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
or
occasionally
on
to
the
beach
or
along
the
promenade
miss
kaye
had
made
a
wise
choice
when
she
decided
to
establish
her
school
at
aberglyn
it
had
the
advantage
of
both
mountain
and
sea
air
and
was
within
easy
reach
of
a
number
of
interesting
places
the
goal
of
walk
was
a
druids
circle
which
lay
high
up
on
a
steep
mountainside
overlooking
the
sea
and
to
reach
it
would
require
a
climb
of
several
hours
their
way
after
leading
at
first
along
a
suburban
road
lined
with
pretty
houses
and
gardens
began
to
grow
more
countrified
and
at
last
they
climbed
over
a
stile
into
a
wood
it
was
the
foot
of
a
gorge
through
which
flowed
a
splendid
torrent
dashing
its
way
over
great
boulders
and
the
glen
was
so
sheltered
that
ferns
were
growing
even
on
the
trunks
and
branches
of
the
trees
and
the
moss
was
like
a
green
carpet
under
foot
the
girls
of
course
rushed
down
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
scrambling
over
the
rocks
flinging
stones
into
the
water
and
trying
to
make
pebbles
skim
on
the
smooth
pools
luckily
nobody
fell
in
though
both
connie
and
brenda
had
such
a
narrow
escape
that
miss
kaye
called
her
flock
to
order
and
bade
them
march
on
once
more
up
the
proper
path
the
trees
gradually
began
to
give
way
to
grassy
banks
which
were
already
spangled
with
celandine
coltsfoot
and
actually
a
few
early
primroses
the
hazel
bushes
were
covered
with
catkins
that
sent
showers
of
golden
pollen
over
the
children
when
they
gathered
them
and
in
a
cosy
sheltered
spot
in
the
hedge
they
found
a
thrush
nest
with
three
blue
eggs
in
it
how
sweet
of
her
to
build
just
here
said
sylvia
looking
with
deep
interest
at
the
structure
so
cunningly
hidden
behind
a
long
spray
of
ivy
i
ca
think
how
she
did
it
all
with
her
beak
is
she
clever
oh
connie
please
do
lift
out
the
eggs
i
sure
you
break
them
she
wo
come
back
while
we
here
so
let
us
go
away
or
else
they
get
quite
cold
and
wo
hatch
out
look
what
i
found
cried
marian
climbing
up
the
bank
with
a
small
white
starlike
flower
in
her
hand
is
it
early
it
a
piece
of
saxifrage
no
that
stitchwort
said
sylvia
who
had
learnt
a
little
botany
at
home
and
liked
to
air
her
knowledge
it
saxifrage
said
marian
decidedly
my
mother
told
me
so
once
herself
and
my
mother
told
me
it
was
stitchwort
my
mother
always
right
she
knows
everything
and
so
does
mine
she
could
make
a
mistake
you
better
ask
miss
kaye
laughed
linda
and
then
she
can
decide
between
you
i
heard
it
called
star
of
bethlehem
so
that
makes
a
third
name
miss
kaye
agreed
at
once
with
sylvia
much
to
marian
chagrin
she
did
not
like
to
be
put
in
the
wrong
and
indeed
kept
obstinately
to
her
own
opinion
and
still
insisted
upon
calling
the
flower
saxifrage
though
miss
kaye
told
her
she
would
show
her
a
picture
of
it
with
the
name
underneath
in
her
botany
book
when
they
returned
you
must
notice
all
the
things
you
see
or
find
said
miss
kaye
i
shall
expect
everybody
to
write
a
composition
next
week
on
the
excursion
there
were
certainly
plenty
of
items
for
the
girls
to
put
down
on
their
lists
a
squirrel
with
a
splendid
bushy
tail
ran
across
the
path
and
scrambled
hastily
up
a
fir
tree
peeping
at
them
from
the
safety
of
the
top
branches
before
he
made
a
mighty
spring
into
an
adjoining
ash
a
heron
sailed
majestically
overhead
its
long
legs
hanging
like
those
of
a
stork
and
its
grey
plumage
dark
against
the
sky
a
whole
flight
of
lapwings
rose
screaming
peewit
from
a
field
where
they
were
feeding
in
company
with
a
flock
of
seagulls
following
the
plough
that
a
labourer
was
driving
through
the
rich
red
earth
on
a
sheltered
wall
a
lizard
lay
basking
in
the
sunshine
and
linda
very
nearly
caught
him
but
he
whisked
away
in
a
moment
and
was
gone
down
a
hole
among
the
stones
before
half
the
class
had
seen
him
there
were
lambs
frisking
about
in
the
meadows
and
as
the
girls
passed
through
a
farmyard
they
found
a
woman
sitting
on
a
doorstep
feeding
one
from
a
bottle
like
a
baby
it
had
lost
its
mother
so
she
told
them
and
had
readily
accepted
her
as
its
nurse
becoming
so
tame
that
it
followed
her
everywhere
about
the
house
and
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
we
had
to
feed
one
of
our
puppies
at
home
like
that
said
linda
we
used
a
tiny
doll
bottle
and
it
was
such
fun
to
mix
the
milk
and
warm
water
and
taste
it
first
to
see
if
it
was
sweet
enough
i
always
loved
jill
much
the
best
but
we
could
rear
her
oswald
was
silly
enough
to
give
her
a
bath
when
she
was
too
young
i
do
think
he
dried
her
properly
and
she
took
cold
and
died
that
generally
the
way
with
one
pets
she
added
with
a
sigh
so
it
is
said
marian
a
most
dreadful
thing
happened
to
gwennie
and
me
we
had
a
lovely
black
rabbit
and
mother
said
we
had
better
not
keep
it
when
we
went
to
school
because
the
little
ones
look
after
it
properly
and
she
would
have
time
herself
a
man
in
the
village
asked
if
he
might
buy
it
from
us
and
we
thought
he
wanted
it
as
a
pet
for
his
children
so
we
sold
it
to
him
then
one
day
i
met
him
on
the
road
and
he
said
missie
that
rabbit
of
yours
was
a
good
one
it
made
us
two
whole
dinners
and
a
basin
of
broth
as
well
we
had
never
dreamt
he
meant
to
kill
it
and
we
were
so
horribly
sorry
canaries
are
the
worst
said
connie
i
had
three
i
hung
the
first
outside
the
nursery
window
and
the
nail
gave
way
and
the
poor
little
fellow
tumbled
right
to
the
ground
and
was
killed
he
was
such
a
good
singer
too
the
cat
got
the
second
then
i
had
a
third
called
i
let
him
out
of
his
cage
one
day
when
bertie
was
filing
the
keel
of
his
boat
and
we
suppose
he
must
have
picked
up
some
of
the
bits
of
lead
because
he
grew
quite
ill
and
died
i
buried
him
under
the
rosebush
in
my
garden
and
granny
offered
a
prize
to
whoever
could
write
the
best
piece
of
poetry
about
him
an
epitaph
she
called
it
who
won
the
prize
bertie
himself
i
ca
quite
remember
it
but
it
began
this
rose
tree
fragrant
shade
our
little
favourite
is
laid
it
was
quite
the
best
of
all
frank
was
very
indignant
because
he
did
win
but
we
none
of
us
liked
his
poetry
he
put
tweetie
is
dead
he
ate
up
some
lead
which
was
lying
about
on
the
floor
it
stuck
in
his
gizzard
and
as
i
no
wizard
he
never
eat
lead
any
more
he
said
it
was
true
at
any
rate
but
granny
decided
that
gizzard
was
as
romantic
as
a
rose
tree
even
if
it
did
rhyme
with
wizard
we
have
a
cat
that
stole
a
kitten
said
jessie
ellis
she
had
two
kittens
of
her
own
and
our
cook
drowned
them
both
poor
puss
was
so
miserable
she
went
about
all
day
looking
for
them
mewing
and
wailing
till
we
felt
quite
wretched
to
hear
her
then
she
disappeared
for
nearly
a
week
and
came
back
one
afternoon
carrying
a
tiny
kitten
in
her
mouth
she
was
so
pleased
with
it
and
kept
licking
it
and
purring
all
the
time
mother
said
she
must
have
adopted
it
and
she
would
let
her
keep
it
and
it
grown
such
a
beautiful
cat
a
real
persian
with
a
ruff
and
a
bushy
tail
we
often
wonder
where
she
took
it
from
while
the
children
were
talking
they
had
been
climbing
steadily
uphill
and
now
left
the
glen
by
a
path
which
led
them
directly
on
to
the
open
moor
it
was
glorious
up
there
in
one
direction
rose
the
mountains
peak
beyond
peak
till
in
the
distance
they
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
rugged
outline
of
snowdon
by
a
wreath
of
cloud
below
them
lay
a
vast
expanse
of
sea
with
anglesey
stretched
out
like
a
map
and
little
puffin
island
close
by
we
ought
almost
to
see
ireland
said
mercy
straining
her
eyes
to
discover
whether
any
faint
speck
of
blue
outline
were
visible
on
the
distant
horizon
people
say
they
seen
the
isle
of
man
too
but
it
has
never
been
clear
enough
when
i
been
up
here
look
at
the
steamers
out
on
the
water
i
wonder
if
one
of
them
going
to
china
i
can
just
remember
coming
home
in
a
big
vessel
and
passing
the
stack
lighthouse
at
holyhead
and
then
landing
at
liverpool
it
splendid
to
be
able
to
look
miles
whichever
way
you
turn
said
sylvia
she
liked
the
solitude
of
the
moors
which
were
covered
only
with
short
grass
and
low
whinberry
bushes
there
was
no
sound
except
the
occasional
bleat
of
a
sheep
or
the
cry
of
a
curlew
and
no
human
being
in
sight
but
themselves
though
one
or
two
small
whitewashed
farms
at
long
distances
apart
gave
evidence
of
life
by
their
smoking
chimneys
not
very
far
away
they
came
upon
the
druids
circle
a
ring
of
tall
upright
stones
so
ancient
that
all
tradition
of
them
had
long
been
lost
though
miss
kaye
explained
to
the
girls
that
they
had
probably
been
used
as
a
kind
of
temple
for
sun
worship
by
the
early
tribes
who
lived
there
long
before
the
romans
discovered
britain
i
wish
they
could
speak
and
tell
us
their
story
she
said
they
would
have
strange
tales
about
the
rough
skinclad
men
who
reared
them
and
the
priests
who
stood
watching
amongst
them
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
sun
on
midsummer
morning
who
knows
but
that
they
may
have
witnessed
human
sacrifices
and
at
any
rate
there
must
have
been
wolves
and
cave
bears
and
hyenas
and
many
wild
animals
prowling
about
which
are
extinct
in
wales
now
we
can
tell
that
because
the
bones
and
teeth
of
these
creatures
have
been
found
in
a
cave
at
llandudno
some
day
i
may
perhaps
take
you
to
see
it
the
skeletons
of
a
man
and
a
woman
were
found
there
embedded
in
the
rock
and
round
their
throats
were
necklaces
made
of
bears
teeth
we
can
hardly
imagine
what
life
was
like
in
those
early
times
the
girls
always
found
miss
kaye
talks
interesting
but
the
healthy
mountain
air
had
so
sharpened
their
appetites
that
they
turned
readily
from
ancient
stones
to
modern
lunch
and
sitting
down
inside
the
famous
circle
drew
out
the
packets
of
sandwiches
and
oranges
which
they
had
brought
with
them
everything
seemed
to
taste
particularly
good
and
everybody
could
have
eaten
a
little
more
but
the
very
last
crumb
of
biscuit
had
been
consumed
and
they
were
obliged
to
remain
content
until
teatime
miss
kaye
made
the
girls
gather
up
their
pieces
of
orange
peel
wrap
them
in
their
sandwich
papers
and
poke
them
away
under
a
boulder
nothing
is
so
horrible
she
declared
as
to
leave
traces
of
picnic
about
to
spoil
the
place
for
the
next
people
who
come
if
everyone
would
do
the
same
there
would
be
few
complaints
that
tourists
ruin
the
scenery
after
lunch
the
girls
were
allowed
to
ramble
on
the
moors
as
they
liked
with
an
injunction
not
to
go
too
far
and
to
return
to
the
druids
circle
when
miss
kaye
blew
a
whistle
it
was
hardly
possible
to
get
lost
because
as
linda
said
they
could
see
all
round
for
miles
and
unless
you
hid
yourself
under
a
bush
someone
would
be
sure
to
find
you
the
members
of
the
third
class
went
off
together
racing
over
the
springy
grass
with
as
much
agility
as
the
small
welsh
sheep
that
seemed
capable
of
climbing
the
stones
like
goats
to
judge
by
the
achievement
of
an
old
ewe
which
ran
up
a
wall
as
easily
as
a
kitten
and
led
its
lamb
after
it
in
a
hollow
at
the
farther
side
of
the
circle
the
children
found
a
sheet
of
shallow
water
evidently
formed
by
the
february
rains
and
melting
snow
at
one
end
was
a
rough
raft
and
a
long
pole
with
which
some
boy
had
no
doubt
been
amusing
himself
the
temptation
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
in
three
seconds
connie
brenda
and
sylvia
were
making
a
trial
trip
the
last
two
squatting
close
together
in
the
middle
to
balance
the
raft
while
connie
pushed
off
with
the
pole
and
punted
them
out
into
the
middle
of
the
pond
it
was
a
most
delightful
sensation
the
water
was
clear
and
they
could
see
down
several
feet
where
there
were
green
weeds
growing
at
the
bottom
and
great
floating
masses
of
some
jellylike
substance
that
connie
declared
was
frog
spawn
i
going
to
get
a
lump
of
it
she
cried
and
take
it
back
to
school
and
put
it
in
a
basin
then
we
can
watch
the
tadpoles
hatch
out
and
grow
into
little
frogs
i
run
the
raft
against
this
island
there
seems
to
be
a
heap
of
it
here
though
the
trio
nearly
upset
their
craft
in
their
efforts
they
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
hold
of
any
of
the
spawn
it
was
as
transparent
and
slimy
as
the
white
of
an
egg
and
kept
slipping
through
their
fingers
as
fast
as
they
touched
it
connie
managed
at
last
to
secure
a
small
piece
by
holding
her
handkerchief
under
it
in
the
water
then
she
tied
the
four
corners
tightly
together
and
put
the
wet
messy
bundle
into
her
pocket
ugh
how
can
you
exclaimed
sylvia
suppose
they
hatch
on
the
way
that
not
very
likely
replied
connie
but
i
do
mind
if
they
do
i
fond
of
tadpoles
the
other
girls
who
had
been
clamouring
for
some
time
from
the
bank
demanding
a
turn
at
the
raft
now
grew
so
indignant
at
the
delay
that
connie
punted
back
and
tried
to
pacify
their
wrath
it
not
fair
to
keep
it
all
the
time
said
marian
some
of
us
want
to
try
it
just
as
much
as
you
and
you
do
know
how
to
work
that
pole
properly
if
you
give
it
to
me
i
soon
show
you
all
right
miss
clever
said
brenda
you
always
do
things
better
than
everybody
else
do
you
go
on
marian
jumped
on
to
the
raft
and
seized
the
pole
with
an
exceedingly
high
and
mighty
air
she
gave
a
push
off
as
an
example
of
the
graceful
manner
in
which
it
ought
to
be
done
but
alas
she
had
not
taken
into
account
the
fact
that
the
raft
was
not
balanced
with
the
weight
of
the
other
children
and
stepping
too
much
to
one
side
she
found
it
suddenly
tilted
over
and
deposited
her
in
the
pond
the
water
was
only
a
foot
deep
so
close
to
the
edge
but
by
the
time
she
had
scrambled
out
her
boots
and
stockings
were
wet
through
and
covered
with
mud
the
rest
of
the
girls
subsided
on
to
the
bank
in
peals
of
laughter
if
that
your
way
i
rather
not
try
it
thank
you
said
nina
and
you
broken
the
pole
too
said
connie
oh
catch
the
raft
somebody
exclaimed
linda
look
it
drifting
right
away
and
we
sha
be
able
to
go
on
it
unluckily
the
raft
was
by
this
time
well
out
of
reach
and
nobody
was
able
to
fetch
it
back
much
to
the
disappointment
of
those
who
had
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
try
it
marian
was
very
offended
at
what
she
considered
the
mirth
of
her
companions
you
most
unkind
she
said
angrily
walking
away
by
herself
and
trying
to
wipe
her
boots
clean
on
the
grass
feeling
that
they
had
had
the
best
of
the
joke
the
girls
bore
no
malice
and
after
leaving
her
for
a
few
minutes
to
get
over
her
sulks
they
made
overtures
of
friendship
i
tell
you
what
said
linda
i
found
a
box
of
wax
matches
in
the
road
on
the
way
up
and
put
them
in
my
pocket
suppose
we
set
a
light
to
this
little
gorse
bush
it
all
withered
and
will
make
quite
a
bonfire
then
marian
can
dry
her
boots
the
bush
caught
fire
with
the
greatest
ease
and
blazed
away
at
once
marian
pulled
off
her
boots
and
stockings
and
standing
barefoot
on
the
grass
held
them
up
to
the
flame
while
the
others
collected
round
wishing
they
had
some
chestnuts
or
potatoes
with
them
or
a
kettle
which
could
be
boiled
for
tea
i
believe
the
grass
is
beginning
to
burn
too
said
nina
stand
back
connie
why
it
caught
the
next
bush
as
well
the
children
looked
at
each
other
with
horrified
faces
the
fire
was
spreading
rapidly
along
the
ground
and
two
large
bushes
were
soon
in
a
blaze
their
modest
beginning
was
evidently
leading
to
more
than
they
had
ever
imagined
fortunately
the
white
column
of
smoke
suddenly
rising
up
through
the
clear
air
attracted
miss
kaye
attention
and
brought
her
hurrying
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
to
discover
the
cause
she
was
much
surprised
to
find
the
members
of
the
third
class
one
of
them
with
bare
feet
apparently
dancing
like
wild
indians
round
a
fire
and
lost
no
time
in
running
to
the
spot
you
naughty
girls
she
exclaimed
what
have
you
been
doing
marian
where
are
your
boots
i
am
astonished
at
you
who
lighted
this
fire
we
trying
to
stamp
it
out
said
brenda
it
was
catching
all
the
grass
but
who
lighted
it
we
did
miss
kaye
replied
linda
rather
shamefacedly
to
dry
marian
boots
people
often
set
fire
to
the
moors
added
connie
i
seen
whole
hillsides
burning
sometimes
so
i
do
suppose
it
matters
helping
the
farmer
the
farmer
may
like
to
set
his
own
furze
alight
but
he
thank
any
chance
strangers
for
doing
so
for
him
if
we
do
mind
he
be
claiming
damages
from
us
said
miss
kaye
we
must
not
leave
here
until
these
bushes
have
burnt
themselves
safely
out
and
we
must
stamp
on
any
sparks
which
fall
from
them
on
to
the
grass
this
is
the
way
that
a
great
prairie
fire
is
often
started
in
america
the
flames
will
grow
in
strength
and
sweep
over
miles
of
country
destroying
farms
and
villages
and
carrying
desolation
and
destruction
before
them
i
did
think
you
would
have
been
in
such
mischief
directly
my
back
was
turned
miss
kaye
looked
so
grave
and
annoyed
that
the
girls
felt
their
grand
idea
had
fallen
rather
flat
and
the
moment
the
fire
was
out
she
told
marian
to
put
on
her
stockings
and
boots
at
once
and
gave
the
signal
to
return
home
it
was
a
very
unpleasant
walk
to
marian
as
her
boots
had
dried
stiff
and
felt
much
too
tight
for
her
while
the
stockings
were
still
rather
moist
and
muddy
everyone
was
tired
and
the
second
class
made
teasing
remarks
about
the
slugs
being
fond
of
slimy
ponds
and
announced
that
they
were
looking
forward
to
hearing
a
sentimental
account
of
the
adventure
through
the
keyhole
on
the
occasion
of
the
next
meeting
of
the
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
you
know
nothing
really
about
the
society
and
it
horribly
mean
to
listen
you
may
be
in
the
upper
school
but
i
ca
say
much
for
your
manners
i
glad
i
not
in
the
second
class
retorted
marian
adding
privately
to
gwennie
however
i
afraid
they
do
know
a
good
deal
and
it
just
spoilt
the
i
do
think
i
shall
trouble
to
write
for
it
again
does
it
seem
twice
as
far
coming
back
as
going
although
it
all
downhill
and
oh
are
you
dreadfully
cruelly
desperately
hungry
and
absolutely
starving
for
your
tea
chapter
xiv
whitweek
with
linda
the
easter
holidays
were
short
and
sweet
the
brief
fortnight
seemed
to
be
over
almost
before
sylvia
had
realized
she
was
at
home
and
both
she
and
her
mother
found
it
harder
than
ever
to
part
when
the
last
day
arrived
there
was
one
compensation
however
which
consoled
sylvia
for
saying
goodbye
mercy
ingledew
had
spent
the
vacation
with
miss
coleman
and
on
her
way
back
to
aberglyn
was
allowed
to
accept
lindsay
invitation
to
stay
a
couple
of
days
with
sylvia
and
travel
with
her
to
school
while
miss
coleman
went
to
see
a
relation
at
llangollen
the
visit
was
a
great
success
and
lindsay
were
delighted
with
mercy
and
glad
that
their
little
daughter
should
have
made
so
charming
a
friend
among
the
elder
girls
while
sylvia
thoroughly
enjoyed
both
acting
hostess
and
the
return
journey
together
to
heathercliffe
house
it
was
now
the
summer
term
which
most
of
the
girls
considered
the
pleasantest
time
of
the
year
every
available
moment
was
spent
tennis
and
croquet
were
in
full
swing
and
the
younger
ones
amused
themselves
with
rounders
and
sylvia
who
a
year
ago
had
affected
to
dislike
running
about
might
now
be
seen
racing
round
the
garden
as
enthusiastically
as
anybody
at
a
game
of
follow
my
leader
or
i
spy
and
she
would
have
been
utterly
astonished
if
anyone
had
reminded
her
of
her
former
tastes
the
school
was
granted
a
brief
holiday
at
whitsuntide
and
as
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
make
the
long
journey
home
for
so
short
a
period
sylvia
was
very
delighted
when
she
was
allowed
to
accept
marshall
invitation
to
return
with
linda
and
spend
the
few
days
at
garth
avon
both
little
girls
looked
forward
to
the
event
with
keen
pleasure
it
was
the
first
time
that
sylvia
had
ever
paid
a
visit
by
herself
and
she
felt
quite
when
she
thought
about
it
they
were
to
go
by
train
as
far
as
conway
where
marshall
was
to
meet
them
and
drive
them
home
in
the
dogcart
to
craigwen
the
place
where
his
house
was
situated
miss
coleman
saw
them
off
at
aberglyn
giving
many
last
injunctions
not
to
lean
against
the
carriage
door
or
hang
out
of
the
window
or
otherwise
misbehave
themselves
and
to
be
sure
not
to
get
out
at
a
wrong
station
which
did
not
seem
a
very
probable
mistake
as
linda
knew
the
line
so
well
she
added
a
word
to
the
guard
which
caused
him
to
come
and
peep
at
them
with
a
smiling
face
and
assure
them
that
he
would
see
them
safely
to
conway
and
they
need
not
be
in
the
least
afraid
linda
and
sylvia
were
rather
insulted
he
need
treat
us
like
babies
said
linda
i
come
alone
more
than
once
it
all
miss
coleman
fussiness
we
might
be
going
to
london
instead
of
only
to
conway
there
we
off
at
last
the
guard
had
put
the
children
in
a
compartment
and
locked
the
door
so
that
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
they
leaned
back
luxuriously
each
in
a
corner
admiring
the
photographs
which
adorned
the
partitions
or
the
view
of
the
sea
from
the
windows
they
were
in
the
highest
spirits
and
to
travel
thus
seemed
a
very
good
beginning
to
a
journey
which
was
all
too
short
they
were
quite
loath
to
get
out
when
the
train
reached
conway
but
the
stop
was
of
the
briefest
and
the
friendly
guard
whisked
both
them
and
their
bags
from
the
carriage
in
a
hurry
and
blowing
his
whistle
jumped
into
his
van
as
it
passed
him
there
daddy
cried
linda
running
to
meet
her
father
who
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
platform
and
seizing
his
hand
oh
daddy
dear
did
you
let
scamp
come
with
you
and
have
you
brought
bess
or
beauty
in
the
trap
bess
said
marshall
when
he
had
welcomed
sylvia
and
scamp
is
tied
up
outside
i
did
dare
to
let
him
into
the
station
are
these
two
bags
all
you
brought
with
you
give
them
both
to
me
scamp
was
a
lively
little
fox
terrier
which
seemed
so
pleased
to
see
linda
again
that
he
nearly
overwhelmed
her
with
his
affection
and
ran
round
and
round
barking
like
a
mad
creature
till
marshall
picked
him
up
and
put
him
in
the
back
of
the
trap
he
ran
the
whole
way
here
he
said
so
i
think
it
would
be
too
far
for
him
to
trot
home
as
well
though
he
never
appears
to
be
the
least
tired
there
was
just
room
on
the
front
seat
for
linda
and
sylvia
side
by
side
sylvia
in
the
middle
and
linda
at
the
end
because
she
was
less
likely
to
fall
out
marshall
touched
bess
with
his
whip
and
they
started
off
through
the
old
streets
past
the
castle
under
the
arched
gateway
and
away
towards
the
mountains
that
rose
up
before
them
in
the
distance
it
was
all
new
country
to
sylvia
who
much
admired
the
view
when
they
had
climbed
the
great
hill
out
of
the
town
and
could
see
the
beautiful
expanse
of
the
vale
of
conway
stretched
below
them
with
the
silvery
river
winding
through
its
midst
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
drive
bess
the
brown
cob
went
along
at
a
good
fast
pace
and
so
soon
covered
the
ground
that
by
four
they
had
passed
under
the
tall
avenue
of
beeches
that
shaded
the
road
and
drawn
up
at
the
hospitable
doorway
of
garth
avon
it
was
a
pretty
oldfashioned
house
overgrown
with
creepers
and
at
present
the
walls
were
a
mass
of
beautiful
pink
and
white
roses
which
scented
the
air
with
their
fragrance
in
front
was
a
lawn
where
garden
seats
basket
chairs
and
a
table
spread
with
a
white
cloth
and
cups
and
saucers
had
a
very
inviting
appearance
i
knew
you
would
like
to
have
tea
said
marshall
kissing
both
the
children
ellen
has
made
an
iced
spongecake
on
purpose
and
baked
some
scones
and
when
heard
you
were
coming
home
she
sent
over
a
box
of
real
scotch
shortbread
linda
take
sylvia
upstairs
and
then
you
can
bring
her
into
the
garden
again
when
you
have
washed
your
hands
lizzie
has
carried
up
your
bags
sylvia
was
to
sleep
with
linda
in
the
spare
bedroom
a
pleasant
room
with
an
oriel
window
and
a
large
bed
hung
with
blue
curtains
that
looked
big
enough
to
hold
four
little
girls
instead
of
two
my
own
room
is
over
the
porch
said
linda
but
it
only
has
one
very
small
bed
in
it
and
mother
thought
you
feel
lonely
if
you
slept
here
quite
by
yourself
it
much
nicer
to
be
together
as
we
are
at
school
is
it
to
this
sylvia
cordially
agreed
the
boys
are
coming
home
too
this
evening
continued
linda
they
going
to
bicycle
all
the
way
from
rhyl
their
school
break
up
until
afternoon
so
they
could
start
until
four
i
expect
they
have
a
nice
ride
if
artie
tyre
keeps
up
he
was
afraid
he
had
a
puncture
hilda
has
any
holiday
at
whitweek
in
london
not
so
well
off
as
when
she
was
at
miss
kaye
but
she
got
beyond
even
the
first
class
you
know
she
seventeen
and
she
to
leave
altogether
soon
i
wish
you
seen
her
it
was
very
pleasant
sitting
at
tea
in
the
dear
old
garden
the
beds
were
a
blaze
of
flowers
and
so
were
the
tall
vases
which
ornamented
the
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
tennis
lawn
scamp
joined
the
party
and
also
a
large
white
persian
cat
which
astonished
sylvia
by
sitting
up
and
begging
as
cleverly
as
her
canine
companion
with
whom
she
seemed
on
excellent
terms
scamp
is
very
fond
of
snowball
said
linda
but
he
hates
all
other
cats
and
he
kill
them
if
he
could
catch
them
one
day
in
conway
he
saw
a
white
puss
rather
like
ours
and
it
was
so
funny
to
watch
him
because
he
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
ought
to
lick
it
or
chase
it
how
beautifully
clean
she
is
said
sylvia
taking
the
pretty
soft
creature
on
her
lap
and
stroking
the
long
silky
fur
do
you
wash
her
we
do
sometimes
replied
linda
but
she
does
like
it
at
all
poor
dear
it
takes
three
of
us
to
manage
it
two
to
hold
her
and
the
other
to
soap
and
rinse
her
i
never
try
it
without
the
boys
once
i
thought
i
had
such
a
splendid
idea
i
was
going
to
try
dry
cleaning
i
rubbed
her
fur
thoroughly
well
with
flour
and
i
was
just
brushing
it
out
again
when
she
screwed
herself
from
my
arms
and
jumped
through
the
open
window
it
was
pouring
with
rain
and
when
she
came
back
she
was
simply
a
pudding
i
did
know
what
to
do
and
the
boys
were
away
so
i
let
out
the
parrot
and
put
her
inside
the
cage
and
then
watered
her
with
the
watering
can
till
i
got
the
paste
off
her
poor
pussie
what
a
shame
said
sylvia
so
it
was
but
i
really
could
help
it
that
time
she
should
keep
herself
clean
and
then
she
would
need
to
go
through
such
troubles
would
you
like
to
come
and
see
the
hens
and
my
bantams
there
was
a
stableyard
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
led
into
a
field
where
the
fowls
were
kept
they
were
a
pet
hobby
with
marshall
who
spent
many
hours
among
her
poultry
and
had
a
particularly
good
strain
of
white
leghorns
which
she
greatly
valued
there
were
a
number
of
neat
wire
runs
each
with
its
small
wooden
henhouse
and
in
several
of
these
were
interesting
families
of
chickens
varying
in
size
from
sweet
fluffy
atoms
as
yellow
as
canaries
to
creatures
which
sylvia
thought
were
not
pretty
at
all
they
have
grown
their
full
feathers
yet
said
linda
ugly
ducklings
still
but
they
be
very
handsome
by
and
by
look
at
this
fussy
old
hen
i
set
her
myself
during
the
easter
holidays
she
was
so
broody
that
she
actually
insisted
on
sitting
on
a
liebig
pot
i
suppose
she
took
it
for
an
egg
she
have
wondered
why
it
hatch
i
expect
if
i
had
given
her
some
real
eggs
instead
you
seem
to
know
all
about
keeping
hens
said
sylvia
i
know
a
little
more
now
but
i
made
a
most
dreadful
mistake
once
mother
told
me
to
go
to
the
henhouse
and
see
if
there
were
any
eggs
to
send
to
aunt
edith
i
knew
that
sometimes
the
hens
laid
in
the
barn
so
i
thought
i
would
go
there
instead
i
hunted
about
and
found
a
nest
with
ten
lovely
brown
eggs
in
it
they
were
quite
warm
so
i
was
sure
they
must
be
perfectly
fresh
and
i
put
them
in
my
basket
and
carried
them
to
the
house
mother
was
in
a
hurry
for
the
post
she
did
ask
where
i
had
got
them
but
only
said
i
had
been
quick
and
packed
them
up
in
a
box
at
once
next
morning
she
went
to
the
barn
to
feed
a
broody
hen
that
was
sitting
there
on
some
very
particular
eggs
that
she
had
bought
specially
and
to
her
horror
she
found
them
all
gone
they
would
have
hatched
in
a
few
days
so
you
can
imagine
how
angry
she
felt
and
what
a
scolding
she
gave
me
for
not
going
to
the
henhouse
as
i
was
told
i
think
it
was
even
worse
though
for
aunt
edith
she
had
meant
to
make
a
simnel
cake
with
the
eggs
mother
sent
her
and
she
broke
one
after
another
and
each
had
a
little
chicken
inside
it
how
dreadful
laughed
sylvia
i
should
think
she
did
made
her
cake
not
with
our
eggs
at
any
rate
and
she
always
teased
me
dreadfully
about
it
since
now
i
want
to
show
you
the
bantams
i
like
them
best
because
they
my
own
the
bantams
had
a
special
wired
run
to
themselves
they
were
extremely
neat
little
birds
with
prettily
marked
plumage
so
tame
that
they
flew
readily
on
to
their
mistress
outstretched
arm
to
eat
the
bread
she
had
brought
for
them
linda
showed
sylvia
their
small
house
with
much
pride
and
was
particularly
pleased
to
find
two
tiny
eggs
in
the
nesting
box
we
can
each
have
one
for
breakfast
morning
she
declared
they
must
have
laid
them
on
purpose
for
us
i
only
got
my
bantams
at
easter
and
these
are
their
first
eggs
i
hoping
so
much
that
one
of
the
little
hens
will
sit
would
it
be
lovely
to
have
some
wee
chicks
about
as
big
as
tomtits
sylvia
had
not
much
experience
with
pets
but
she
was
deeply
interested
in
linda
possessions
the
starling
that
lived
in
a
cage
in
the
kitchen
and
had
learnt
to
say
come
kiss
me
and
who
at
the
door
the
dormouse
that
was
kept
in
a
cosy
box
lined
with
hay
and
would
scamper
round
the
table
in
the
evenings
and
eat
the
nuts
which
were
given
him
like
a
miniature
squirrel
and
bute
the
rough
bouncing
yard
dog
that
slept
in
the
big
kennel
and
was
not
allowed
to
come
into
the
house
at
all
there
something
else
i
like
you
to
see
said
linda
taking
sylvia
arm
and
leading
her
on
to
the
lawn
again
then
through
a
small
door
into
the
kitchen
garden
a
delightful
walled
enclosure
full
of
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
young
apple
trees
early
vegetables
and
pot
herbs
with
patches
of
pinks
pansies
and
growing
in
between
and
great
fragrant
bushes
of
rosemary
lavender
and
southernwood
which
smelled
most
delicious
when
the
children
rubbed
them
between
their
hands
in
a
corner
under
a
blossoming
syringa
was
a
little
grave
with
a
small
tombstone
at
its
head
on
which
was
roughly
carved
the
following
inscription
in
loving
memory
of
jock
the
best
and
most
faithful
dog
that
ever
lived
died
february
aged
years
it
needs
cleaning
up
and
weeding
said
linda
we
always
keep
it
very
tidy
when
we
at
home
but
of
course
when
the
boys
are
away
too
there
nobody
to
look
after
it
it
rather
nicely
done
it
very
said
sylvia
who
did
it
oswald
he
clever
with
his
hands
and
he
chipped
it
out
with
a
chisel
it
took
him
a
frightfully
long
time
but
he
said
jock
deserved
it
we
could
let
him
be
forgotten
what
kind
of
a
dog
was
he
i
afraid
he
was
only
a
mongrel
he
was
big
and
grey
and
shaggy
but
we
thought
him
lovely
there
never
was
another
so
nice
not
even
scamp
no
not
quite
jock
was
such
a
friend
and
so
obedient
and
gentle
we
got
him
from
a
farm
when
he
was
a
tiny
puppy
the
farmer
was
just
going
to
drown
him
but
oswald
begged
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
keep
him
instead
that
mother
said
he
might
our
nurse
was
quite
angry
at
first
she
said
he
be
as
much
trouble
as
another
child
to
look
after
but
he
was
so
good
she
soon
grew
fond
of
him
and
he
used
to
live
in
the
nursery
artie
was
a
baby
then
and
jock
would
keep
guard
over
his
cradle
or
watch
him
when
he
was
put
to
roll
on
a
rug
in
the
garden
and
no
matter
how
much
artie
pulled
his
hair
he
never
dreamt
of
biting
he
used
to
sleep
on
the
mat
at
the
door
of
our
bedroom
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
come
running
in
wagging
his
tail
one
summer
we
went
to
stay
at
llandudno
and
mother
said
we
mus
take
jock
with
us
because
the
people
at
the
lodgings
would
care
to
have
him
we
were
dreadfully
sorry
to
leave
him
behind
and
i
sure
he
knew
we
were
going
without
him
for
he
cried
so
father
said
he
must
be
tied
up
in
the
stable
to
prevent
him
from
following
the
trap
and
we
all
went
to
say
goodbye
to
him
even
nellie
our
nurse
kissed
him
on
the
nose
we
missed
him
so
much
that
evening
when
we
got
to
llandudno
but
next
morning
when
we
were
sitting
at
breakfast
we
heard
a
whining
and
scratching
at
the
door
and
in
rushed
jock
with
about
half
a
yard
of
rope
dangling
at
his
neck
he
must
have
gnawed
it
through
and
set
off
after
us
but
was
it
clever
of
him
to
know
where
we
gone
and
to
find
out
the
very
house
where
we
were
staying
father
said
he
must
have
heard
us
talking
about
llandudno
and
have
asked
all
the
other
dogs
he
met
on
the
road
which
was
the
right
way
mother
was
afraid
we
should
have
to
send
him
home
again
but
when
the
landlady
heard
what
he
done
she
allowed
him
to
stay
and
he
went
everywhere
with
us
and
was
no
trouble
to
anybody
one
day
nellie
took
us
a
long
walk
on
the
great
orme
head
we
had
baskets
with
us
and
we
wandered
about
picking
blackberries
the
whole
afternoon
artie
was
quite
a
little
fellow
then
not
more
than
three
years
old
he
had
even
been
put
into
knickerbockers
i
suppose
we
were
so
busy
filling
our
baskets
that
nobody
noticed
him
at
any
rate
he
managed
to
run
away
from
nellie
and
go
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
there
were
some
blackberries
growing
we
think
he
must
have
been
trying
to
lean
down
to
gather
them
and
have
overbalanced
himself
because
we
suddenly
heard
him
shrieking
at
the
pitch
of
his
voice
and
when
we
rushed
to
see
what
was
the
matter
there
was
our
baby
hanging
over
the
cliffside
just
caught
by
the
brambles
and
jock
holding
on
to
his
kilt
like
grim
death
artie
was
howling
and
jock
was
making
the
queerest
noise
he
could
bark
properly
because
he
dare
open
his
mouth
for
fear
of
letting
go
artie
clothes
nellie
pulled
them
both
back
together
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
cried
and
we
all
hugged
jock
and
kissed
him
mother
said
afterwards
she
thought
he
must
have
been
allowed
to
find
his
way
to
llandudno
on
purpose
to
save
artie
life
after
that
of
course
he
was
a
greater
pet
even
than
he
been
before
and
we
never
went
away
from
home
without
taking
him
granny
used
to
put
in
a
special
invitation
to
jock
when
she
asked
us
and
she
made
him
a
little
cake
once
on
his
birthday
and
sent
it
to
him
by
post
he
ate
it
in
three
gulps
we
were
so
dreadfully
sorry
when
he
died
hilda
said
she
like
to
go
into
mourning
and
artie
and
i
inked
black
edges
to
some
sheets
of
tiny
notepaper
and
wrote
on
them
to
tell
granny
and
aunt
edith
we
had
a
beautiful
funeral
for
him
and
made
wreaths
to
lay
on
his
grave
and
planted
the
prettiest
flowers
we
could
dig
up
out
of
our
gardens
on
it
it
was
oswald
who
thought
of
the
stone
during
the
easter
holidays
it
was
finished
until
hilda
had
gone
back
to
london
so
she
has
seen
it
yet
i
sure
she
like
it
there
seemed
so
many
interesting
things
to
see
and
hear
at
garth
avon
that
the
two
girls
amused
themselves
until
after
seven
when
they
heard
a
brisk
ringing
of
bells
and
running
to
the
gate
were
just
in
time
to
open
it
for
linda
brothers
who
came
riding
up
on
their
bicycles
oswald
was
a
few
years
older
than
linda
and
artie
a
little
younger
both
were
nice
hearty
boys
who
seemed
ready
to
make
friends
at
once
with
their
sister
visitor
we
heard
such
a
jolly
lot
about
you
you
know
said
oswald
shaking
hands
lin
can
talk
of
nobody
else
we
always
say
the
school
must
be
made
up
of
sylvia
and
miss
kaye
you
late
are
you
asked
linda
we
thought
you
have
been
here
an
hour
ago
we
may
well
be
late
artie
tyre
punctured
on
the
road
between
abergele
and
llandulas
and
we
had
to
walk
our
machines
to
colwyn
bay
before
we
could
get
anyone
to
mend
it
we
tried
to
patch
it
up
ourselves
but
i
had
a
big
enough
piece
of
rubber
to
cover
it
then
the
fellow
at
the
bicycle
shop
was
such
a
slow
chap
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
all
night
fiddling
over
it
and
we
did
dare
to
pump
it
till
it
had
dried
a
little
luckily
we
got
some
tea
before
we
left
school
but
we
hungry
enough
now
is
supper
ready
ready
and
spoiling
said
linda
it
sausages
and
i
could
smell
them
cooking
through
the
kitchen
window
half
an
hour
ago
sylvia
and
i
have
been
watching
in
the
garden
for
you
ever
so
long
be
quick
and
come
down
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
most
delightful
plan
thought
of
for
chapter
xv
an
excursion
with
a
donkey
linda
plan
proved
such
a
promising
one
that
both
the
boys
and
sylvia
fell
in
readily
with
her
ideas
she
suggested
that
they
should
all
four
make
an
excursion
to
the
top
of
pen
y
gaer
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
where
were
the
remains
of
a
very
fine
british
camp
and
from
which
they
could
obtain
an
excellent
view
over
the
whole
of
the
conway
valley
as
it
was
rather
a
long
walk
from
craigwen
she
thought
they
might
borrow
a
donkey
and
take
it
in
turns
to
ride
and
also
carry
their
lunch
on
its
back
they
could
no
doubt
buy
milk
and
get
hot
water
at
a
farm
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
make
tea
before
they
returned
and
thus
enjoy
a
whole
day
on
the
moors
marshall
willingly
gave
her
consent
her
children
were
fond
of
picnics
and
steady
enough
to
look
after
themselves
without
any
person
being
with
them
she
had
always
encouraged
the
boys
at
any
rate
to
be
and
though
artie
was
apt
to
fall
occasionally
into
mischief
she
knew
oswald
would
take
care
of
the
little
girls
and
bring
them
home
safely
in
the
evening
sylvia
looked
forward
so
much
to
the
expedition
that
she
could
scarcely
sleep
for
excitement
when
she
got
into
the
large
spare
bed
with
linda
and
the
candle
was
blown
out
she
lay
awake
for
quite
a
long
time
listening
to
an
owl
hooting
in
the
trees
and
the
soft
rippling
sound
of
a
stream
which
flowed
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
then
at
last
they
both
merged
into
a
confused
dream
and
she
remembered
nothing
more
till
she
woke
with
the
sun
pouring
in
through
the
window
and
linda
voice
proclaiming
that
it
was
a
particularly
fine
warm
morning
and
the
very
day
in
all
the
year
which
she
would
have
chosen
to
scale
the
heights
of
pen
y
gaer
directly
breakfast
was
over
the
children
started
off
first
to
a
neighbouring
farm
to
borrow
the
donkey
a
shaggy
little
creature
called
teddie
which
was
chiefly
used
by
his
owner
to
fetch
sacks
of
flour
from
the
mill
he
was
not
accustomed
to
either
saddle
or
bridle
but
the
boys
led
him
home
by
a
halter
and
tied
a
cushion
on
to
his
back
with
a
piece
of
rope
they
slung
their
lunch
baskets
and
two
enamelled
tin
mugs
on
either
side
like
then
giving
sylvia
the
first
ride
they
helped
her
to
mount
and
set
off
towards
the
mountains
with
scamp
and
bute
racing
in
wild
excitement
around
them
it
was
a
very
hot
day
so
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
they
would
soon
be
out
of
the
close
woods
and
away
on
the
breezy
moors
the
country
was
at
its
best
the
fields
were
blue
with
wild
hyacinths
and
the
hedgerows
yellow
with
gorse
and
broom
while
everywhere
the
tender
shoots
of
the
young
bracken
were
unfolding
and
showing
delicate
fronds
it
was
a
little
late
for
yet
oswald
and
artie
boylike
could
not
resist
hunting
in
each
spot
though
a
blackbird
second
brood
a
deserted
linnet
nest
and
a
last
year
were
the
sole
result
of
their
search
i
wish
we
could
make
the
donkey
trot
said
sylvia
who
had
dismounted
to
spare
poor
teddie
legs
for
the
hardest
part
of
the
hill
but
had
taken
her
seat
again
on
reaching
a
level
piece
of
road
we
try
what
we
can
do
said
artie
producing
his
penknife
and
cutting
a
stick
carefully
from
a
hazel
tree
i
give
him
a
switch
but
i
advise
you
to
hold
on
tight
in
case
he
kicks
it
was
not
a
very
hard
blow
but
teddie
seemed
to
resent
it
extremely
he
was
a
donkey
with
a
character
and
instead
of
galloping
on
as
sylvia
had
hoped
he
ran
straight
into
the
hedge
where
he
entangled
both
her
hat
and
hair
so
successfully
in
a
bush
that
she
had
to
scream
to
be
released
perhaps
you
hit
him
on
the
wrong
side
she
suggested
when
the
donkey
nose
had
been
pulled
out
into
the
lane
again
then
we
try
the
other
said
artie
who
having
dropped
his
stick
administered
a
sounding
smack
on
the
thick
shaggy
coat
teddie
however
evidently
did
not
intend
to
be
coerced
he
made
at
once
for
the
opposite
hedge
and
sylvia
found
herself
in
equal
difficulties
with
a
long
spray
of
bramble
he
the
most
obstinate
little
beast
i
ever
known
said
linda
we
try
him
just
once
more
oswald
you
hold
his
head
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
then
artie
and
i
each
give
him
a
thump
at
the
same
second
one
on
each
side
are
you
ready
artie
one
two
three
off
illustration
he
entangled
both
her
hat
and
hair
in
a
bush
this
time
it
was
really
off
and
away
the
donkey
took
to
his
heels
and
cantered
along
the
road
in
fine
style
with
the
boys
and
linda
racing
after
him
encouraging
sylvia
who
was
laughing
and
trying
to
hold
on
her
hat
and
to
keep
the
lunch
from
falling
while
scamp
and
bute
barked
themselves
hoarse
the
enamelled
mugs
bumped
against
poor
teddie
sides
and
alarmed
him
so
much
that
perhaps
he
thought
somebody
was
switching
him
in
front
and
intended
him
to
run
backwards
for
he
stopped
quite
suddenly
and
lowered
his
head
with
the
result
that
sylvia
shot
over
his
neck
and
found
herself
sitting
in
the
dusty
road
it
serves
me
right
she
laughed
no
i
not
hurt
in
the
least
it
too
bad
to
make
him
trot
when
he
carrying
both
me
and
the
lunch
i
walk
now
and
give
him
a
rest
and
then
it
will
be
turn
to
ride
him
the
road
after
winding
uphill
for
several
miles
between
woods
and
high
banks
led
at
last
on
to
the
moors
where
there
was
a
kind
of
tableland
flanked
on
two
sides
by
chains
of
mountains
we
not
such
a
very
long
way
from
the
druids
circle
said
linda
it
only
over
that
peak
i
believe
it
farther
than
you
imagine
said
oswald
hilda
and
i
went
to
it
once
and
we
thought
we
should
never
get
there
it
a
much
easier
way
from
aberglyn
things
look
so
very
plain
in
this
clear
air
that
you
often
think
you
quite
close
when
really
you
several
miles
off
and
you
walk
and
walk
and
never
seem
to
get
any
nearer
i
hope
that
wo
happen
with
pen
y
gaer
we
can
see
it
so
well
now
said
linda
gazing
at
the
round
green
top
that
did
not
show
its
full
height
from
the
plateau
though
it
looked
imposing
enough
from
the
valley
below
it
quite
far
enough
to
make
me
want
lunch
before
i
go
any
farther
said
oswald
there
a
stream
down
here
where
we
can
get
some
water
to
drink
suppose
we
fasten
teddie
to
the
gate
and
camp
out
on
the
stones
the
others
agreed
the
donkey
had
already
satisfied
its
thirst
at
a
brooklet
that
crossed
the
road
so
they
tied
it
to
the
rail
of
the
gate
with
a
piece
of
rope
long
enough
to
allow
it
to
crop
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
path
and
descending
themselves
to
the
bed
of
the
river
spread
out
their
lunch
on
a
large
flat
boulder
marshall
had
experience
in
the
matter
of
picnics
first
there
were
ham
sandwiches
sufficiently
thick
to
take
the
keen
edge
off
their
appetites
but
not
enough
to
spoil
the
eggs
and
bread
and
butter
which
followed
then
came
marmalade
sandwiches
and
seed
cake
and
last
of
all
some
delicious
little
turnovers
made
with
tops
like
mince
pies
and
with
strawberry
jam
inside
everybody
was
hungry
and
everybody
did
such
ample
justice
to
the
good
fare
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
solitary
turnover
left
which
they
decided
to
divide
between
the
dogs
which
had
already
had
their
share
of
the
meal
it
not
enough
to
keep
for
tea
said
oswald
i
expect
we
can
get
some
bread
and
butter
at
the
farm
as
well
as
the
milk
and
hot
water
look
there
are
trout
in
this
stream
i
saw
a
big
fellow
just
then
swimming
across
the
pool
so
did
i
said
artie
he
went
under
that
rock
i
going
to
wade
and
see
if
i
can
get
him
out
both
boys
pulled
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
and
plunging
into
the
river
began
to
engage
in
the
very
unsportsmanlike
pastime
of
tickling
trout
they
paddled
cautiously
upstream
putting
their
hands
under
every
likely
stone
till
they
felt
a
fish
then
very
gently
moving
their
fingers
along
until
they
had
him
by
the
gills
would
manage
with
a
quick
jerk
to
toss
him
out
of
the
water
on
to
the
bank
linda
and
sylvia
followed
along
the
side
much
excited
at
this
new
form
of
fishing
and
gathering
up
the
trout
placed
them
in
one
of
the
lunch
baskets
the
boys
had
succeeded
in
catching
five
or
six
which
lay
shining
and
silvery
gasping
their
last
and
they
were
both
trying
for
a
particularly
big
one
which
they
could
see
lying
in
the
cranny
of
a
rock
he
be
a
tough
subject
said
oswald
i
do
my
best
but
you
be
ready
to
make
a
grab
if
i
miss
him
oswald
stealthily
put
forward
his
hand
but
the
trout
was
on
the
alert
and
long
before
he
could
reach
its
gills
it
had
darted
into
the
pool
escaping
artie
also
who
nearly
fell
into
the
water
in
his
efforts
to
secure
it
missed
him
what
a
shame
and
he
was
such
a
beauty
cried
the
disconsolate
boys
now
then
what
are
you
doing
there
you
young
poachers
shouted
a
voice
from
the
opposite
bank
and
looking
up
the
children
saw
a
tall
man
in
a
corduroy
velveteen
suit
and
a
soft
round
hat
frowning
at
them
with
a
most
unamiable
expression
of
countenance
they
were
so
astonished
that
none
of
them
knew
what
to
say
come
out
of
that
stream
this
minute
he
commanded
the
boys
who
obeyed
but
naturally
on
the
side
where
linda
and
sylvia
were
standing
looking
rather
frightened
at
such
an
unexpected
and
angry
visitor
the
man
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
gamekeeper
crossed
the
river
easily
by
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
and
striding
up
to
the
little
girls
peeped
inside
their
basket
as
i
thought
he
remarked
now
you
young
rascals
do
you
know
that
i
can
take
you
all
up
and
send
you
to
prison
for
poaching
why
gasped
oswald
we
were
only
catching
some
trout
only
catching
some
trout
he
says
he
was
only
catching
some
trout
echoed
the
man
as
if
he
were
appealing
to
an
imaginary
companion
i
suppose
he
would
call
that
poaching
oh
no
we
get
them
like
this
in
our
own
stream
at
home
said
artie
that
quite
a
different
matter
because
you
get
bread
and
butter
at
home
no
reason
why
you
should
walk
into
my
house
and
take
mine
is
it
this
fishing
happens
to
be
preserved
and
i
got
the
care
of
it
it
a
very
serious
offence
is
poaching
i
caught
you
there
the
trout
in
that
basket
to
prove
my
words
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
in
much
consternation
we
did
know
we
were
doing
any
harm
said
oswald
at
last
that
just
what
folks
always
tell
me
in
a
little
affair
of
this
kind
said
the
man
producing
a
pencil
and
a
notebook
i
getting
rather
tired
of
the
story
i
trouble
you
for
your
names
and
addresses
if
you
please
why
do
you
want
them
asked
artie
cautiously
you
know
why
when
you
find
yourselves
charged
at
the
llanrwst
county
court
replied
the
man
with
a
grin
or
your
father
will
to
the
tune
of
five
pounds
and
costs
i
reckon
or
pretty
near
take
all
your
pocket
money
or
more
i
go
to
prison
first
said
oswald
stoutly
and
so
will
i
declared
artie
oh
no
no
cried
linda
thoroughly
frightened
and
dissolving
into
tears
please
do
send
them
to
prison
look
i
put
the
fish
back
into
the
water
we
did
know
it
was
wrong
to
take
them
we
indeed
the
man
coughed
softly
behind
his
hand
i
would
like
to
disoblige
the
young
lady
he
said
but
it
no
use
putting
dead
fish
back
into
the
stream
there
as
linda
tears
flowed
faster
i
wo
be
too
hard
on
you
this
time
give
me
the
trout
and
we
say
no
more
about
it
but
do
let
me
catch
any
of
you
poaching
here
again
or
i
ca
let
you
go
so
easy
i
my
orders
from
headquarters
now
be
off
with
you
all
much
relieved
that
the
boys
should
escape
fine
or
imprisonment
linda
emptied
the
fish
from
the
basket
on
to
the
grass
and
seizing
sylvia
hand
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
up
the
bank
to
where
they
had
left
the
donkey
tied
to
the
gate
followed
by
oswald
and
artie
who
only
stopped
to
pick
up
their
shoes
and
stockings
by
the
way
they
were
glad
to
place
the
stone
wall
between
themselves
and
the
angry
gamekeeper
and
as
soon
as
the
boys
had
put
on
their
footgear
they
loosed
teddie
and
started
off
once
more
on
the
road
towards
pen
y
gaer
what
a
horrid
cross
man
said
sylvia
i
peeped
over
the
wall
just
now
and
he
was
still
standing
there
and
shook
his
fist
at
me
i
did
know
any
of
the
water
was
preserved
said
oswald
who
felt
sore
at
the
remembrance
well
he
need
think
we
want
to
go
there
again
after
his
old
fish
they
are
such
treasures
as
he
supposes
sour
grapes
laughed
artie
oh
shut
up
it
was
you
who
suggested
tickling
them
first
said
oswald
who
was
thoroughly
out
of
temper
and
ready
to
quarrel
with
anybody
artie
however
was
a
little
fellow
and
had
the
tact
simply
to
whistle
and
leave
his
brother
to
get
over
his
ill
humour
as
nobody
was
riding
the
donkey
he
mounted
it
himself
and
persuading
linda
and
sylvia
to
try
what
he
called
the
method
indulged
in
a
splendid
gallop
which
did
not
meet
with
so
disastrous
a
termination
as
the
last
one
they
had
almost
reached
the
goal
of
their
walk
and
taking
teddie
to
a
farm
which
stood
near
they
asked
the
woman
to
allow
them
to
leave
him
there
while
they
scaled
the
summit
of
pen
y
gaer
and
to
have
her
kettle
boiling
by
the
time
they
came
back
their
path
now
led
away
from
the
road
and
over
a
stile
on
to
the
heather
it
was
a
stiff
climb
and
made
more
difficult
by
the
thick
gorse
through
which
they
were
obliged
to
push
their
way
but
the
view
from
the
top
was
sufficient
compensation
for
any
trouble
they
had
in
arriving
there
on
one
hand
they
could
see
the
whole
extent
of
the
valley
from
bettws
y
coed
to
conway
and
even
the
houses
on
the
promenade
at
llandudno
fully
ten
miles
away
while
on
the
other
stretched
the
beautiful
moors
leading
to
the
gloomy
hollow
of
lake
dulyn
behind
which
the
mountain
ridges
showed
purple
and
jagged
against
the
sky
all
around
they
could
trace
the
ruins
of
the
old
british
fort
great
piles
of
stones
that
must
have
been
rolled
there
with
incredible
labour
perhaps
by
the
very
tribe
which
had
reared
the
druids
circle
on
the
slope
of
tal
y
fan
some
of
the
welsh
people
say
a
giant
put
them
here
said
oswald
who
had
recovered
his
spirits
or
i
not
sure
if
it
was
king
arthur
himself
at
any
rate
he
took
a
tremendous
jump
down
the
hillside
and
left
his
footprint
on
a
rock
in
the
stream
below
there
he
must
have
worn
a
no
shoe
to
judge
by
the
size
uncle
frank
made
up
a
ridiculous
story
once
said
linda
it
was
all
about
the
black
bull
of
llyn
dulyn
and
how
it
came
one
night
to
garth
avon
and
tapped
at
mother
window
with
its
horns
and
said
that
one
of
the
little
bulls
had
met
with
an
accident
to
its
eye
and
heard
that
she
had
a
whole
bottle
of
so
would
she
please
bring
some
and
come
at
once
with
him
and
cure
it
the
village
people
are
always
fetching
mother
like
that
to
see
their
children
and
simply
terrified
of
bulls
so
he
told
it
just
on
purpose
to
tease
her
talking
of
makes
me
think
of
tea
said
artie
i
sure
that
old
woman
kettle
must
be
boiling
now
i
vote
we
go
down
and
see
let
us
try
this
other
part
of
the
hill
it
be
far
quicker
than
scrambling
through
the
gorse
again
one
side
of
the
summit
was
almost
as
steep
as
the
roof
of
a
house
and
covered
with
very
short
fine
grass
at
present
so
dry
and
slippery
that
the
children
sat
down
and
slid
almost
as
if
it
were
winter
and
they
were
tobogganing
on
the
snow
it
was
great
fun
especially
when
artie
caught
against
a
stone
and
rolled
over
and
over
like
a
ball
till
a
convenient
gorse
bush
made
a
prickly
impediment
in
his
career
and
linda
left
both
hat
and
hair
ribbon
behind
and
was
obliged
to
scramble
up
the
slope
again
to
fetch
them
it
was
certainly
a
much
faster
way
back
to
the
little
whitewashed
cottage
the
farmer
wife
could
not
speak
much
english
but
she
said
a
great
deal
in
welsh
which
they
took
to
be
an
invitation
to
come
inside
where
they
found
she
had
set
a
round
table
by
the
fire
nicely
spread
with
cups
and
saucers
and
a
clean
cloth
the
chimney
was
so
big
and
wide
that
as
they
sat
on
the
settle
they
could
look
right
up
and
see
a
patch
of
sky
at
the
top
from
a
large
beam
hung
a
chain
supporting
the
kettle
which
was
boiling
over
on
a
fire
of
peat
and
dried
heather
that
gave
out
a
very
fragrant
aromatic
smell
almost
recalling
guy
fawkes
day
especially
when
it
was
blown
by
the
bellows
for
tea
there
was
a
large
loaf
of
brown
barley
bread
and
notwithstanding
the
ample
lunch
which
they
had
eaten
by
the
stream
they
were
all
hungry
enough
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
in
spite
of
the
saltness
of
the
butter
it
was
so
pleasant
sitting
in
the
quaint
little
mountain
cottage
with
its
dim
light
and
peaty
atmosphere
and
there
were
so
many
jokes
to
make
and
stories
to
tell
that
they
lingered
until
the
tall
grandfather
clock
striking
five
reminded
them
that
they
were
still
a
good
many
miles
away
from
craigwen
and
that
it
was
time
to
be
taking
the
donkey
and
setting
out
once
more
on
their
homeward
walk
we
had
a
jolly
day
said
oswald
as
tired
but
in
excellent
spirits
the
four
at
last
reached
the
gate
of
garth
avon
done
splendidly
i
give
him
a
report
even
for
galloping
and
he
deserves
a
good
feed
of
oats
you
girls
go
in
artie
and
i
take
him
back
to
the
farm
are
you
coming
scamp
why
i
really
believe
it
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
seen
a
dog
look
dead
beat
chapter
xvi
the
chinese
charm
what
are
we
going
to
do
asked
oswald
after
breakfast
next
morning
we
an
uncommonly
short
holiday
so
we
must
spin
it
out
as
well
as
we
can
who
votes
for
llangelynin
too
far
and
too
hot
replied
artie
stretching
himself
comfortably
in
his
father
armchair
i
feel
more
inclined
to
lie
on
the
lawn
and
laze
than
go
climbing
hills
again
it
too
far
for
you
all
after
your
long
walk
yesterday
said
marshall
you
boys
may
do
what
you
like
this
morning
but
linda
and
sylvia
are
to
stay
quietly
in
the
garden
until
there
an
invitation
for
you
to
have
tea
at
severn
which
of
course
i
have
accepted
i
was
sure
you
would
all
like
to
go
rather
said
oswald
he
the
jolliest
chap
i
know
and
saying
a
good
deal
artie
suppose
we
take
ourselves
off
to
the
marsh
and
have
a
dip
in
the
pool
it
about
the
coolest
thing
i
can
suggest
for
a
day
like
this
and
we
shall
both
enjoy
a
swim
who
is
dr
severn
said
sylvia
to
linda
when
the
boys
had
started
for
their
bathe
and
the
two
little
girls
were
sitting
in
a
cool
shady
place
under
the
trees
with
their
books
on
their
knees
he
a
gentleman
who
came
last
summer
to
live
at
a
house
not
very
far
away
answered
linda
we
only
got
to
know
him
lately
but
he
so
nice
and
the
boys
simply
adore
him
has
he
any
children
of
his
own
no
we
heard
they
were
dead
and
his
wife
too
but
he
never
spoken
about
them
even
to
father
and
mother
he
lives
quite
alone
with
a
housekeeper
to
look
after
him
he
been
in
all
kinds
of
foreign
places
and
his
rooms
are
so
full
of
funny
things
it
just
like
going
to
a
museum
there
a
stuffed
crocodile
and
a
mummied
cat
and
a
horrid
lizard
in
a
bottle
and
some
snake
skins
and
a
locust
and
a
scorpion
and
a
whole
case
of
lovely
butterflies
he
tells
us
about
them
sometimes
and
where
he
found
them
i
hope
he
show
them
to
us
said
sylvia
who
thought
the
collection
sounded
interesting
i
sure
he
will
if
we
ask
him
said
linda
i
should
like
to
see
them
again
myself
especially
the
crocodile
he
has
a
big
cabinet
full
of
little
drawers
and
he
keeps
curiosities
in
them
from
every
place
he
been
to
there
one
with
nothing
but
shells
and
another
for
corals
and
a
third
for
coins
and
the
rest
are
each
for
a
separate
country
he
very
careful
over
them
he
wo
let
us
take
anything
out
ourselves
or
even
handle
some
of
them
he
so
afraid
they
might
get
broken
still
it
fun
to
look
even
if
we
may
touch
i
expect
it
a
thousand
times
nicer
than
my
museum
at
home
said
sylvia
though
i
have
a
cabinet
in
the
schoolroom
i
have
seen
your
museum
yet
so
i
ca
say
but
i
sure
enjoy
severn
we
been
to
tea
twice
before
and
each
time
we
had
raspberry
sandwich
and
plumcake
and
little
crisp
cocoanut
biscuits
i
hope
the
housekeeper
will
make
them
there
always
the
most
delicious
apricot
jam
too
and
he
hands
round
a
big
jug
of
cream
and
tells
us
to
help
ourselves
then
there
a
horizontal
bar
in
the
garden
that
the
boys
love
they
do
some
of
the
things
on
it
that
they
learn
in
the
gymnasium
at
school
and
there
a
tank
with
pink
water
lilies
growing
in
it
only
i
do
think
they
be
out
just
yet
i
so
glad
he
asked
us
because
i
want
you
to
go
and
see
it
all
what
a
good
thing
miss
coleman
managed
to
put
that
clean
dress
in
my
bag
said
sylvia
what
should
i
have
done
without
it
i
got
this
in
quite
a
mess
yesterday
i
should
have
had
to
lend
you
one
of
my
white
muslins
and
i
sure
they
be
too
short
for
me
this
year
so
they
would
be
far
too
small
for
you
you
an
inch
taller
than
i
am
though
you
so
much
thinner
we
both
to
wear
our
sailor
hats
mother
said
i
put
on
my
last
year
sunday
summer
one
if
you
had
your
best
with
you
and
of
course
it
is
a
party
the
invitation
was
for
four
and
by
three
marshall
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
prospective
guests
into
what
she
considered
a
sufficient
state
of
tidiness
for
the
occasion
it
was
about
twenty
minutes
walk
to
dale
side
a
pretty
modern
bungalow
which
had
been
built
by
an
english
gentleman
with
a
leaning
towards
the
picturesque
and
who
had
therefore
chosen
the
site
to
secure
the
most
beautiful
views
and
had
made
the
interior
as
artistic
as
his
excellent
taste
could
devise
after
living
there
a
few
years
the
owner
on
account
of
his
wife
health
had
gone
to
reside
in
italy
and
the
little
property
had
been
on
sale
until
the
preceding
summer
when
it
had
been
purchased
together
with
a
few
acres
of
land
by
severn
who
was
a
newcomer
to
the
neighbourhood
though
he
was
therefore
only
a
comparative
stranger
the
young
marshalls
already
regarded
the
kindly
doctor
as
a
friend
and
it
was
with
very
smiling
faces
that
they
rang
his
bell
that
afternoon
i
saw
you
arriving
cried
their
host
hastening
to
the
door
himself
to
meet
them
i
was
just
looking
out
for
you
and
hoping
you
would
come
soon
to
interrupt
a
tiresome
letter
i
felt
obliged
to
write
now
i
justified
in
putting
it
off
for
an
hour
or
two
at
any
rate
linda
quite
shocked
at
me
but
i
did
say
i
would
finish
it
afterwards
did
i
shall
we
go
straight
through
to
the
pine
wood
had
the
table
carried
out
there
for
tea
it
the
coolest
place
we
can
find
on
a
hot
day
by
the
time
she
had
known
him
ten
minutes
sylvia
had
decided
that
she
liked
severn
immensely
he
was
a
tall
rather
gaunt
man
with
a
thin
pale
face
that
bore
traces
of
ill
health
or
suffering
in
the
hollow
cheeks
and
the
lines
around
the
mouth
his
hair
was
iron
grey
rather
long
and
combed
straight
back
from
his
broad
forehead
and
he
had
the
brightest
keenest
pleasantest
blue
eyes
that
it
was
possible
to
imagine
his
manner
was
so
winning
and
jolly
that
he
made
everybody
feel
at
home
immediately
he
seemed
to
know
exactly
the
subjects
about
which
boys
and
girls
liked
to
talk
and
to
be
able
to
enter
into
everything
almost
as
if
he
were
a
boy
himself
the
four
visitors
soon
found
themselves
chatting
to
him
perfectly
freely
telling
him
of
school
scrapes
and
adventures
of
plans
for
the
summer
holidays
and
asking
his
opinion
on
various
disputed
points
while
he
in
turn
was
full
of
jokes
and
reminiscences
of
his
own
schooldays
never
save
the
best
till
last
he
declared
handing
round
the
cake
long
before
the
plates
of
bread
and
butter
were
finished
i
kept
to
that
motto
ever
since
i
was
a
small
boy
and
i
had
very
good
reason
for
adopting
it
once
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
of
about
seven
years
old
i
was
taken
to
pay
a
visit
to
an
old
lady
who
lived
in
the
country
children
were
brought
up
on
the
plainest
fare
in
those
days
porridge
and
bread
and
milk
roast
beef
or
mutton
with
potatoes
rice
pudding
or
suet
dumpling
with
jam
as
a
special
treat
on
your
birthday
was
all
that
was
considered
good
for
us
so
you
can
imagine
i
felt
pleased
when
i
saw
a
large
pudding
full
of
currants
come
on
to
the
table
at
the
old
lady
gave
me
a
generous
serving
and
told
me
to
help
myself
to
as
much
sugar
as
i
liked
with
it
assuring
my
mother
that
sweet
things
were
necessary
for
children
a
sentiment
with
which
i
cordially
agreed
then
whatever
opinions
my
elders
might
hold
there
were
a
great
many
currants
in
my
slice
of
pudding
and
it
struck
me
how
much
nicer
they
would
taste
if
i
could
eat
them
all
together
as
a
titbit
at
the
last
so
i
picked
them
carefully
out
one
by
one
and
put
them
to
the
side
of
my
plate
i
suppose
it
must
have
taken
me
rather
a
long
time
or
perhaps
the
others
had
smaller
helpings
at
any
rate
they
had
finished
first
and
all
laid
down
their
spoons
and
forks
except
myself
i
gulped
my
last
piece
of
pudding
in
a
hurry
and
was
just
going
to
enjoy
my
fruit
when
the
old
lady
who
had
been
watching
me
said
poor
boy
is
he
fond
of
currants
leave
them
my
dear
i
would
never
force
a
child
to
eat
what
it
does
like
adding
a
direction
to
the
servant
to
take
my
plate
away
i
had
had
tremendous
warnings
before
i
came
about
behaving
myself
properly
and
also
i
was
much
too
shy
to
protest
so
i
was
obliged
to
watch
my
cherished
currants
being
whisked
from
the
table
before
i
had
been
able
to
taste
a
single
one
of
them
if
i
had
ever
been
inclined
to
be
miserly
i
think
this
incident
would
have
cured
me
of
hoarding
up
riches
what
a
shame
did
you
get
anything
instead
asked
artie
not
at
dinner
but
afterwards
the
old
lady
who
was
a
very
kind
soul
took
me
into
her
kitchen
garden
and
told
me
to
eat
as
many
ripe
gooseberries
as
i
liked
there
were
various
sorts
big
red
ones
hairy
yellow
ones
and
smooth
green
ones
and
i
sure
i
ate
enough
to
make
up
amply
for
what
i
missed
at
pudding
time
as
far
as
i
recollect
i
never
stopped
picking
the
whole
afternoon
small
boys
can
accommodate
a
great
deal
i
do
think
gooseberries
do
one
any
harm
said
artie
we
eat
simply
loads
we
each
sit
down
beside
a
bush
and
try
who
can
make
the
biggest
pile
of
skins
mother
says
the
blackbirds
would
take
them
if
we
did
i
glad
she
does
make
a
fuss
about
it
as
some
people
do
said
linda
i
was
so
angry
last
summer
a
lady
came
one
afternoon
to
see
us
and
brought
a
horrid
little
girl
with
her
called
mona
mother
told
me
to
take
this
child
into
the
kitchen
garden
and
give
her
some
fruit
so
i
marched
her
off
and
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
her
mother
called
out
you
may
have
eight
strawberries
and
twelve
gooseberries
darling
but
no
more
she
was
very
stupid
and
talk
to
me
so
i
kept
picking
the
ripest
and
biggest
strawberries
and
gooseberries
i
could
find
and
handing
them
to
her
i
never
thought
of
counting
them
but
she
suddenly
went
quite
red
and
said
she
have
any
more
she
hardly
look
at
the
chickens
or
the
rabbits
or
anything
i
tried
to
show
her
and
i
was
very
glad
indeed
when
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
home
her
mother
came
to
fetch
her
from
the
garden
and
said
you
eat
more
than
i
told
you
dear
and
mona
said
i
did
this
little
girl
tried
very
hard
to
make
me
but
i
take
even
one
strawberry
more
was
i
good
the
lady
looked
at
me
as
if
she
thought
i
deserved
smacking
but
i
could
explain
because
she
was
just
shaking
hands
with
mother
and
saying
goodbye
i
felt
cross
about
it
ever
since
and
if
she
brings
mona
again
i
declare
i
run
away
and
hide
and
not
take
her
into
the
garden
at
all
do
you
think
it
was
too
bad
much
too
bad
said
severn
i
think
mona
was
what
is
called
a
prig
please
go
on
with
the
cocoanut
biscuits
i
assure
you
i
not
counting
them
i
really
could
eat
another
said
linda
though
they
very
delicious
are
you
going
to
show
us
any
of
your
curiosities
in
the
house
you
promised
you
would
and
sylvia
does
so
want
to
see
them
a
promise
is
a
promise
replied
severn
rising
from
his
basket
chair
but
in
the
meantime
i
think
i
see
richards
coming
through
the
garden
in
search
of
us
i
wonder
if
he
had
any
tea
richards
was
the
curate
and
a
great
favourite
with
oswald
and
artie
he
was
an
athletic
young
fellow
fresh
from
college
and
always
ready
to
go
skating
or
boating
or
to
play
a
game
of
cricket
with
them
or
carry
them
off
with
him
to
the
golf
links
he
declared
now
that
he
had
already
had
tea
but
was
longing
for
a
little
exercise
on
severn
horizontal
bar
where
he
thought
he
could
show
the
boys
a
feat
or
two
which
perhaps
they
had
not
yet
learnt
at
school
oswald
and
artie
rushed
away
with
him
at
once
and
flinging
off
their
coats
were
soon
vying
with
each
other
in
swinging
circling
hanging
by
their
legs
or
feet
and
various
other
acrobatic
performances
that
looked
exceedingly
warm
work
for
a
hot
day
but
which
seemed
to
afford
them
the
most
immense
satisfaction
severn
stood
by
and
encouraged
them
to
do
their
best
then
after
watching
for
a
short
time
left
them
with
richards
and
took
linda
and
sylvia
into
the
house
you
be
getting
tired
of
circus
and
would
rather
have
museum
for
a
change
i
expect
he
said
i
show
you
all
my
curios
and
then
you
shall
each
choose
something
for
me
to
tell
you
about
the
study
was
a
delightful
little
room
with
a
french
window
opening
into
the
garden
one
side
was
quite
filled
by
a
large
japanese
cabinet
with
many
sliding
cupboards
and
drawers
linda
certainly
had
not
exaggerated
the
number
of
wonderful
things
which
it
contained
there
were
treasures
from
egypt
from
palestine
from
india
from
china
and
from
japan
wherever
the
doctor
had
travelled
he
seemed
to
have
picked
up
some
object
of
interest
and
to
examine
the
various
drawers
was
like
taking
a
peep
into
far
countries
he
allowed
linda
and
sylvia
to
dress
themselves
up
in
some
of
the
gorgeous
silk
scarves
and
sashes
to
slip
on
the
japanese
kimonos
and
put
their
feet
into
the
turkish
slippers
i
think
i
like
the
indian
things
best
they
smell
the
nicest
said
linda
snuffing
at
a
sandalwood
box
and
trying
the
effect
of
some
filagree
ornaments
on
her
own
hair
and
sylvia
how
grand
the
women
must
look
in
these
no
i
should
like
to
wear
the
nose
ring
thank
you
nor
the
earrings
though
i
love
the
bangles
they
must
have
tiny
wrists
i
can
only
just
push
these
over
my
hands
are
they
meant
for
a
child
no
replied
severn
they
are
really
for
a
woman
but
the
people
of
all
eastern
nations
have
very
small
hands
compared
with
us
westerns
if
you
like
the
scent
of
sandalwood
what
do
you
think
of
this
it
comes
from
the
vale
of
kashmir
he
drew
the
stopper
from
a
bottle
of
attar
of
roses
as
he
spoke
the
odour
was
so
deliciously
sweet
and
overpowering
that
it
filled
the
whole
room
it
the
true
stuff
said
the
doctor
not
the
wretched
imitation
which
is
often
sold
over
here
now
if
i
put
a
drop
on
each
of
your
pocket
handkerchiefs
it
will
scent
all
your
clothes
for
a
where
are
they
it
lucky
they
clean
ones
said
sylvia
rummaging
in
her
pocket
i
shall
keep
mine
in
my
drawer
after
this
and
not
send
it
to
the
wash
ever
it
lovelier
even
than
lavender
water
or
eau
de
cologne
i
believe
it
takes
a
thousand
roses
to
make
one
drop
of
this
said
severn
so
you
have
a
great
deal
of
concentrated
sweetness
there
this
round
box
comes
from
damascus
and
i
do
think
it
quite
empty
yet
if
you
have
smelled
true
attar
you
ought
also
to
taste
genuine
turkish
delight
open
your
mouths
and
shut
your
eyes
and
you
find
a
surprise
dressed
in
the
wonderful
embroidered
garments
with
silver
ornaments
in
their
hair
scented
with
roses
and
their
mouths
full
of
lumps
of
delight
the
two
little
girls
felt
as
if
they
had
wandered
into
the
land
of
the
arabian
nights
had
been
transformed
into
eastern
princesses
and
had
only
to
command
a
slave
of
the
lamp
to
come
forward
and
carry
out
their
slightest
desire
it
simply
lovely
said
linda
i
never
tasted
anything
so
nice
in
my
life
before
i
think
you
a
magician
and
can
carry
us
off
to
persia
or
india
or
anywhere
with
a
wave
of
your
wand
but
please
you
promised
to
tell
us
each
a
story
about
something
and
you
done
so
yet
because
you
have
chosen
a
said
severn
say
what
you
like
and
i
try
to
wave
my
magic
wand
then
i
have
this
funny
little
tassel
of
blue
beads
that
a
charm
against
the
evil
eye
said
the
doctor
i
got
it
in
cairo
the
mohammedan
mothers
believe
many
people
especially
strangers
to
be
possessed
of
most
uncanny
powers
and
think
that
if
they
look
very
hard
at
their
babies
they
can
bewitch
them
and
cause
them
to
catch
various
diseases
and
even
to
die
to
avert
the
evil
they
put
charms
on
the
children
and
you
may
see
a
tiny
boy
with
his
head
shaved
all
except
a
long
lock
which
hangs
over
his
eyes
with
one
of
these
bead
talismans
dangling
at
the
end
the
charms
are
always
blue
because
that
is
considered
the
magical
colour
the
people
are
very
dark
themselves
so
they
are
terrified
at
the
sight
of
an
englishman
with
eyes
of
the
dreaded
shade
they
are
quite
sure
he
must
be
a
desperately
bad
character
and
it
is
safer
to
keep
out
of
his
path
when
i
have
been
in
the
east
i
have
often
seen
mothers
turn
their
babies
away
lest
my
glance
should
fall
on
them
it
is
considered
very
unlucky
also
to
praise
a
child
and
its
parents
even
though
they
may
be
extremely
rich
will
sometimes
let
it
look
dirty
and
neglected
for
fear
anyone
might
happen
to
admire
it
you
ca
bewitch
me
cried
linda
i
got
the
talisman
safe
in
my
hand
i
did
say
i
was
admiring
you
did
i
laughed
the
doctor
though
these
gorgeous
robes
are
certainly
very
becoming
you
a
true
magician
i
shall
be
frightened
of
you
now
is
that
all
you
can
tell
me
about
my
i
afraid
i
know
no
more
then
sylvia
it
your
turn
may
i
choose
exactly
what
i
want
asked
sylvia
certainly
you
may
replied
severn
then
i
like
to
hear
the
story
of
that
little
carved
ivory
locket
that
hanging
on
your
it
looks
like
a
charm
too
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
the
doctor
face
at
sylvia
words
but
he
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
that
would
not
interest
you
dear
child
he
said
gravely
it
is
not
a
curiosity
such
as
the
other
things
i
have
shown
you
it
a
charm
though
is
it
asked
sylvia
i
been
noticing
it
all
the
afternoon
it
so
exactly
like
another
i
seen
that
could
hardly
be
said
severn
this
carving
has
no
duplicate
but
i
know
one
that
its
own
twin
persisted
sylvia
it
the
same
size
and
shape
and
has
the
same
carving
on
it
these
little
kind
of
leaves
round
the
edge
and
these
marks
like
queer
letters
in
the
middle
i
could
possibly
forget
it
where
did
you
see
it
enquired
linda
it
the
chinese
charm
that
they
found
tied
round
mercy
neck
when
she
was
brought
to
the
hospital
she
showed
it
me
one
sunday
evening
and
i
held
it
in
my
hand
and
looked
at
it
so
carefully
where
did
your
friend
get
her
charm
asked
severn
quickly
it
was
fastened
round
her
neck
when
she
was
a
baby
a
chinese
woman
crawled
with
her
to
the
hospital
because
she
was
so
wounded
she
was
dying
not
mercy
i
mean
but
the
poor
woman
mercy
was
hurt
at
all
they
adopted
her
at
the
hospital
and
then
she
was
brought
to
england
and
came
to
miss
kaye
but
nobody
ever
found
out
yet
who
she
is
is
it
just
like
a
storybook
said
sylvia
who
loved
to
bring
forward
the
romantic
side
of
her
friend
history
how
long
ago
is
it
since
this
happened
enquired
severn
with
a
curious
strained
tone
in
his
voice
which
neither
of
the
children
noticed
about
sixteen
years
mercy
is
nearly
seventeen
is
that
her
true
name
no
nobody
knew
her
real
name
so
they
called
her
mercy
ingledew
she
had
on
chinese
clothes
and
the
nurse
thought
the
locket
must
be
a
chinese
charm
too
she
had
a
single
english
thing
that
anyone
could
tell
her
by
was
it
a
pity
a
great
pity
if
her
friends
are
alive
to
claim
her
we
do
know
whether
they
are
or
not
said
sylvia
i
always
trying
to
find
them
but
miss
kaye
says
i
not
to
talk
to
mercy
about
it
because
it
no
use
to
keep
raising
false
hopes
and
we
must
all
be
very
kind
to
her
to
make
up
for
her
not
having
a
father
and
mother
of
her
own
it
funny
her
little
charm
should
be
just
the
same
as
yours
though
is
it
did
this
one
come
from
china
too
i
should
have
liked
a
story
about
it
some
other
day
perhaps
said
severn
rising
hastily
and
walking
to
the
window
let
us
go
out
and
find
the
boys
the
sky
looks
so
threatening
i
afraid
there
a
thunderstorm
brewing
and
i
had
better
send
you
home
before
it
begins
we
must
take
off
our
wonderful
clothes
then
said
linda
beginning
to
untwist
the
scarves
and
put
away
the
turkish
slippers
goodbye
dear
sandalwood
box
how
i
love
the
smell
of
you
keep
the
box
if
you
like
said
severn
briefly
and
you
sylvia
the
bottle
of
attar
i
do
want
either
come
children
i
sorry
to
hurry
you
but
i
do
want
you
to
be
caught
in
the
rain
get
your
hats
and
richards
will
see
you
home
on
his
way
to
craigwen
chapter
xvii
the
sketching
class
linda
and
sylvia
had
a
great
many
experiences
to
relate
to
the
other
girls
when
they
returned
to
heathercliffe
house
and
as
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
class
who
had
been
away
for
the
few
days
they
were
able
to
enjoy
a
position
of
much
importance
until
their
adventures
were
all
told
nothing
particular
seemed
to
have
happened
during
their
absence
brenda
had
broken
her
bedroom
jug
connie
had
fallen
against
the
mowing
machine
and
her
forehead
was
ornamented
with
large
strips
of
sticking
plaster
which
did
not
improve
her
personal
appearance
and
dolly
had
locked
the
door
of
the
book
cupboard
in
the
kindergarten
room
and
lost
the
key
much
to
miss
coleman
wrath
otherwise
there
were
no
events
worth
chronicling
unless
you
like
to
hear
that
i
made
a
fresh
copy
of
my
greek
history
notes
said
marian
they
most
beautifully
neat
and
underlined
with
red
ink
i
sure
miss
kaye
say
they
better
than
anybody
else
but
as
both
linda
and
sylvia
declared
that
did
not
interest
them
in
the
least
marian
piece
of
information
fell
rather
flat
all
the
girls
seemed
to
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
settle
into
harness
again
after
the
short
holiday
the
weather
was
warm
and
in
spite
of
open
windows
the
schoolrooms
were
apt
to
feel
close
and
stuffy
miss
arkwright
tried
the
plan
of
holding
her
class
under
the
big
hawthorn
in
the
garden
but
she
found
that
a
bird
singing
in
the
tree
a
bumble
bee
settling
on
a
flower
or
a
butterfly
flitting
across
the
lawn
was
enough
to
put
dates
and
rivers
completely
out
of
her
pupils
minds
and
to
wipe
even
their
facts
from
their
memories
so
she
did
not
repeat
her
experiment
in
our
grandmothers
days
schools
always
had
their
holidays
in
june
said
sylvia
yawning
as
she
idly
picked
the
heads
off
the
daisies
on
the
lawn
one
afternoon
they
broke
up
just
when
the
hot
weather
begins
and
then
they
had
all
the
lovely
time
when
the
evenings
are
so
long
and
you
can
be
until
bedtime
and
the
strawberries
are
ripe
and
they
cutting
the
hay
i
think
it
was
far
nicer
we
do
break
up
till
the
of
july
yes
but
remember
they
have
the
whole
of
august
at
school
said
marian
think
of
having
to
come
back
just
at
the
time
when
going
away
now
to
the
seaside
and
what
an
enormous
term
it
would
make
till
christmas
they
had
quarters
then
said
sylvia
and
a
little
holiday
at
michaelmas
like
the
easter
one
i
do
believe
children
went
home
from
for
it
though
if
you
read
books
you
will
notice
that
the
boys
always
talk
of
half
as
if
they
stayed
from
midsummer
to
christmas
and
from
christmas
to
midsummer
again
it
must
have
seemed
such
a
long
while
i
think
it
must
have
been
perfectly
horrible
to
go
to
school
then
said
nina
forster
my
grandmother
tells
me
stories
about
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
i
should
have
hated
it
they
had
to
learn
their
lessons
off
by
heart
and
stand
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
and
say
them
just
like
parrots
and
if
they
forgot
or
made
a
mistake
the
governess
rapped
them
on
the
head
with
her
thimble
she
called
it
pie
it
used
to
make
them
too
nervous
to
remember
things
how
nasty
of
her
what
else
did
they
do
asked
the
girls
who
liked
to
be
told
tales
while
they
lounged
they
had
to
use
backboards
every
day
and
chest
expanders
then
they
had
much
plainer
food
than
we
have
and
they
were
obliged
to
finish
up
every
morsel
upon
their
plates
they
might
leave
anything
they
always
had
brown
bread
except
on
sundays
and
rice
puddings
nearly
every
day
they
hardly
ever
went
picnics
or
excursions
they
only
used
to
go
for
stupid
walks
along
the
roads
two
and
two
with
a
mistress
at
each
end
the
music
teacher
had
a
silver
pencil
with
a
heavy
knob
at
the
end
and
if
a
girl
played
a
wrong
note
she
used
to
bring
it
down
with
a
thump
upon
her
hand
granny
says
it
made
her
hate
music
then
they
might
send
letters
home
without
the
headmistress
seeing
them
and
she
used
to
make
them
write
the
most
absurd
rubbish
so
that
they
were
their
own
letters
at
all
granny
had
her
twelfth
birthday
at
school
and
when
she
wrote
to
thank
her
father
for
his
present
the
governess
insisted
on
her
putting
that
i
have
attained
to
my
twelfth
year
i
feel
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
must
put
away
childish
things
was
it
stupid
they
used
to
write
the
most
beautiful
hand
though
far
far
neater
than
ours
but
they
took
a
fearfully
long
time
over
it
they
spend
a
week
at
an
exercise
that
we
do
in
a
day
the
teachers
were
very
strict
and
very
cross
and
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
punishments
being
sent
to
bed
and
being
kept
in
and
learning
long
columns
of
spelling
granny
says
girls
are
spoilt
now
but
i
know
i
rather
go
to
miss
kaye
than
to
the
school
she
was
at
i
should
think
so
said
the
others
i
do
believe
any
other
could
be
really
nicer
than
this
i
sometimes
wish
i
gone
to
a
different
one
though
said
jessie
ellis
why
because
my
three
cousins
were
here
and
they
so
tremendously
clever
it
rather
hard
when
you
not
very
bright
yourself
and
the
teachers
keep
saying
mean
to
tell
me
you
ca
learn
this
and
you
an
ellis
i
think
they
must
have
taken
my
share
of
the
brains
in
the
family
at
any
rate
it
not
quite
fair
to
blame
me
because
i
ca
do
everything
they
did
ethel
won
a
scholarship
for
newnham
and
i
never
even
scrape
through
the
easiest
class
exam
as
a
rule
i
care
much
mother
says
i
must
be
a
home
girl
and
like
sewing
i
glad
i
do
get
my
pocket
money
by
my
marks
oh
but
does
anybody
yes
i
knew
a
girl
who
did
her
father
gave
her
sixpence
every
week
she
was
top
and
nothing
at
all
if
she
was
lower
than
halfway
in
the
class
he
said
it
was
to
make
her
work
before
i
came
to
school
i
used
to
get
my
pocket
money
for
doing
things
said
brenda
i
had
a
penny
for
every
hour
i
practised
so
if
i
wanted
to
save
up
i
used
to
do
a
little
extra
at
the
piano
then
there
was
a
penny
a
week
for
wearing
my
gloves
and
another
penny
for
using
the
back
stairs
and
a
halfpenny
for
eating
salt
and
another
halfpenny
if
i
remembered
to
wipe
my
boots
i
rather
liked
it
i
do
think
it
was
nice
at
all
declared
marian
it
was
bribing
you
to
do
what
you
ought
to
have
done
in
any
case
yes
so
it
was
echoed
gwennie
we
always
wipe
our
boots
oh
you
two
are
perfect
of
course
said
brenda
you
never
do
anything
wrong
what
about
that
french
book
which
was
lost
last
week
it
was
my
fault
or
gwennie
either
said
marian
rising
and
putting
an
end
to
a
conversation
which
threatened
to
become
too
personal
somebody
must
have
borrowed
it
without
asking
us
i
going
in
now
to
learn
my
verbs
and
she
departed
leaving
the
others
laughing
for
poor
marian
did
not
always
succeed
in
living
entirely
according
to
her
excellent
precepts
and
practice
what
you
preach
is
a
motto
held
in
high
estimation
by
schoolgirls
though
ordinary
lessons
in
the
garden
had
proved
a
failure
miss
kaye
made
a
new
departure
by
arranging
that
dawson
the
drawing
master
should
organize
a
sketching
class
to
include
those
of
his
pupils
whom
he
considered
sufficiently
advanced
to
benefit
by
outdoor
instruction
it
was
mostly
composed
of
girls
from
the
first
and
second
classes
but
marian
linda
and
sylvia
had
done
such
good
work
in
the
studio
that
dawson
decided
he
would
allow
them
to
commence
drawing
from
nature
and
to
their
great
delight
they
were
permitted
to
join
the
party
they
felt
almost
like
artists
as
they
set
off
with
camp
stools
sketching
blocks
pencils
indiarubbers
paintboxes
and
water
tins
and
were
installed
under
their
master
direction
beneath
the
shade
of
a
hedge
to
make
a
valiant
attempt
at
reproducing
a
picturesque
gate
and
a
gnarled
oak
tree
which
overhung
it
it
was
a
great
deal
more
difficult
than
they
had
at
first
imagined
the
bars
of
the
gate
were
puzzling
and
the
oak
tree
somehow
refused
to
turn
out
a
tree
at
all
and
was
inclined
to
bear
more
resemblance
to
a
or
a
telegraph
pole
it
may
be
better
when
we
get
some
colour
on
said
sylvia
hopefully
everyone
will
know
the
brown
part
is
meant
for
the
trunk
and
the
green
part
for
leaves
my
gate
looks
as
if
i
been
playing
naughts
and
crosses
on
my
paper
sighed
linda
i
rubbed
it
out
seven
times
and
i
afraid
it
not
straight
now
the
paper
quite
spoilt
it
be
horrid
when
i
begin
to
paint
we
ca
expect
to
do
very
much
the
first
time
i
suppose
said
marian
my
tree
looks
like
a
cabbage
on
a
broomstick
i
can
lend
you
my
indiarubber
if
you
want
it
to
clean
up
with
it
a
softer
one
than
yours
i
want
to
get
to
the
painting
part
and
yet
i
afraid
to
begin
so
am
i
said
linda
i
do
know
what
dawson
will
say
when
he
sees
the
muddle
i
made
of
this
gate
here
he
comes
now
the
master
must
certainly
have
found
the
little
girl
work
far
from
talented
but
taking
her
seat
he
made
a
patient
effort
to
correct
the
mistakes
in
her
drawing
adding
a
clever
line
or
two
of
his
own
to
show
her
how
it
ought
to
be
done
then
with
a
word
of
encouragement
to
marian
and
sylvia
he
passed
on
to
some
of
his
elder
pupils
the
painting
did
not
prove
such
a
redeeming
feature
as
sylvia
had
anticipated
her
sky
refused
to
go
on
smoothly
and
as
she
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
let
it
dry
properly
before
she
commenced
her
tree
the
edges
ran
into
each
other
hopelessly
producing
an
effect
that
was
perhaps
too
impressionistic
for
most
tastes
the
trunk
of
the
tree
would
not
appear
round
and
the
branches
had
an
uncomfortable
suggestion
of
signposts
and
she
could
not
get
the
right
colour
for
the
grass
and
found
the
shadows
absolutely
baffling
it
a
perfect
daub
she
cried
flinging
down
her
brush
as
mercy
came
round
presently
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
so
mine
i
afraid
said
mercy
you
may
see
it
if
you
like
but
it
hardly
worth
looking
at
i
letting
it
dry
before
i
touch
it
any
more
it
was
getting
into
such
a
dreadful
mess
sketching
from
nature
is
at
all
easy
i
think
dawson
extremely
clever
to
paint
such
lovely
things
you
should
see
the
sweet
little
bit
he
put
in
for
trissie
knowles
it
seems
no
trouble
to
him
i
wish
you
do
a
piece
for
me
mercy
said
linda
oh
i
dare
dawson
would
find
it
out
directly
and
perhaps
he
might
like
it
may
spencer
sketch
is
far
the
best
of
anybody
she
just
dashed
it
off
and
it
looks
so
nice
helen
ward
let
her
sky
dry
in
patches
and
dawson
had
to
take
her
board
to
the
stream
and
dip
it
in
the
water
to
wash
it
off
again
we
doing
the
cottage
you
know
round
the
corner
and
when
sybil
lake
had
painted
all
the
front
of
hers
she
discovered
she
left
out
one
of
the
windows
who
this
coming
along
the
road
interrupted
marian
he
smiling
at
one
of
us
i
sure
i
do
know
him
do
you
dr
severn
cried
linda
and
sylvia
and
springing
up
they
put
their
sketching
materials
on
the
grass
and
hurried
to
meet
him
good
afternoon
this
is
quite
a
surprise
to
me
said
the
doctor
i
did
expect
to
find
my
two
little
friends
suddenly
blossoming
into
artists
i
hope
i
not
interrupting
a
lesson
oh
no
we
all
waiting
for
dawson
to
come
round
and
tell
us
what
to
do
next
said
linda
where
are
you
going
doctor
wo
you
sit
down
and
talk
for
a
minute
please
have
my
camp
stool
it
a
big
surprise
to
us
added
sylvia
we
did
know
you
ever
came
to
aberglyn
i
find
myself
here
said
severn
thank
you
linda
but
i
afraid
i
should
break
down
your
little
seat
if
i
were
to
put
my
weight
on
it
there
a
convenient
stump
here
which
will
do
very
well
now
you
can
imagine
i
an
art
critic
and
show
me
some
of
the
masterpieces
i
see
both
your
friends
are
painting
also
he
continued
smiling
at
mercy
and
marian
will
they
let
me
look
at
their
pictures
too
severn
was
always
at
his
ease
with
young
people
his
pleasant
blue
eyes
and
genial
manner
seemed
to
attract
them
at
once
and
he
had
soon
added
mercy
and
marian
to
the
list
of
his
admirers
i
used
to
do
a
little
sketching
myself
once
he
said
when
he
had
duly
inspected
the
four
studies
and
sympathized
with
their
difficulties
so
i
know
how
much
harder
it
is
than
it
looks
particularly
when
one
a
beginner
i
found
many
quaint
corners
to
paint
when
i
was
abroad
especially
in
china
and
japan
china
were
you
ever
in
china
asked
mercy
with
some
eagerness
i
was
stationed
in
for
more
than
twenty
years
replied
severn
do
you
know
the
ingledew
hospital
at
i
have
heard
of
it
but
i
never
been
there
i
was
in
a
different
district
and
the
distances
were
great
and
travelling
often
dangerous
i
wish
you
seen
it
said
mercy
wistfully
i
lived
there
for
six
years
and
i
still
write
to
and
harrison
and
to
sister
grace
their
names
are
well
known
though
i
have
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
them
personally
answered
severn
gazing
steadily
at
mercy
with
a
strange
look
in
his
blue
eyes
can
you
remember
much
of
your
life
in
china
not
a
great
deal
i
was
only
seven
when
i
left
and
there
has
been
nobody
to
talk
to
me
about
it
and
remind
me
i
have
forgotten
the
narrow
streets
and
the
crowds
of
people
in
strange
dresses
who
used
to
be
walking
about
in
them
nor
our
garden
at
the
hospital
with
the
camellias
and
the
high
wall
round
it
i
remember
the
little
mission
church
too
where
we
had
service
on
sundays
it
was
all
in
chinese
but
i
could
speak
it
then
quite
easily
i
could
understand
a
single
word
now
do
you
know
chinese
doctor
asked
linda
very
well
replied
severn
though
it
took
me
many
years
of
hard
study
to
learn
it
it
the
most
difficult
language
in
the
world
worse
than
french
fifty
times
worse
i
should
think
it
was
worth
the
trouble
there
were
reasons
which
made
me
consider
it
worth
any
amount
of
trouble
i
wished
to
talk
to
the
people
and
as
they
understand
my
speech
i
was
forced
to
learn
theirs
were
they
pleased
some
of
them
were
grateful
some
of
them
did
care
and
some
were
very
angry
with
me
i
was
like
the
man
who
sowed
the
seed
i
had
to
fling
it
everywhere
no
matter
what
ground
it
fell
on
and
can
you
write
chinese
characters
too
asked
marian
a
little
but
not
so
well
as
i
can
talk
here
comes
your
drawing
teacher
i
afraid
he
think
i
encouraging
you
to
be
idle
goodbye
for
the
present
you
may
very
likely
see
me
again
before
the
day
is
over
i
wonder
what
severn
talked
to
the
people
about
in
china
said
sylvia
as
she
watched
his
retreating
figure
walking
briskly
away
down
the
road
it
must
have
been
something
very
important
to
make
him
take
so
much
trouble
i
think
i
can
guess
said
mercy
softly
as
she
picked
up
her
sketch
and
ran
back
to
her
easel
in
time
for
the
master
criticism
chapter
xviii
severn
explains
linda
and
sylvia
had
been
much
delighted
at
their
unexpected
meeting
with
the
owner
of
dale
side
and
could
talk
of
nothing
else
during
tea
you
may
judge
therefore
sylvia
astonishment
and
interest
when
on
passing
the
shortly
before
preparation
hour
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
severn
seated
there
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
miss
kaye
the
was
forbidden
ground
to
the
girls
so
after
one
hasty
glance
sylvia
was
on
the
point
of
hurrying
away
and
had
already
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
miss
kaye
called
to
her
come
in
my
dear
said
the
mistress
as
sylvia
timidly
presented
herself
not
certain
whether
she
had
done
anything
wrong
or
not
come
in
and
close
the
door
after
you
severn
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
and
sylvia
went
and
stood
by
his
side
feeling
sure
now
that
whatever
was
the
matter
she
was
not
going
to
be
scolded
it
was
sylvia
and
not
linda
who
spoke
of
it
enquired
miss
kaye
i
believe
you
said
sylvia
i
did
replied
severn
she
mentioned
that
her
schoolfellow
had
shown
it
to
her
it
may
of
course
be
merely
a
coincidence
but
it
seems
worth
investigating
and
i
should
greatly
like
to
see
it
what
are
they
talking
about
sylvia
wondered
glancing
from
one
to
another
to
try
and
read
the
answer
in
their
faces
she
could
not
understand
the
conversation
at
all
nor
connect
it
with
anything
that
had
occurred
miss
kaye
however
soon
enlightened
her
you
told
severn
sylvia
that
mercy
ingledew
had
shown
you
a
carved
ivory
locket
which
was
tied
round
her
neck
when
she
was
found
at
the
hospital
in
china
i
was
not
aware
that
mercy
possessed
it
and
i
have
never
seen
it
myself
can
you
describe
it
it
was
just
the
same
as
the
one
severn
has
answered
sylvia
it
was
seeing
his
that
made
me
think
of
mercy
they
are
both
exactly
alike
you
are
absolutely
sure
quite
it
was
small
and
beautifully
carved
with
little
leaves
round
the
edge
and
funny
letters
in
the
middle
i
thought
it
must
be
meant
for
a
locket
only
it
wo
open
as
you
say
it
is
certainly
a
remarkable
coincidence
said
miss
kaye
turning
to
severn
i
am
very
anxious
not
to
distress
the
poor
girl
needlessly
but
i
think
we
are
justified
in
looking
into
the
matter
sylvia
will
you
go
and
find
mercy
and
tell
her
quietly
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
in
the
and
ask
her
to
bring
this
locket
with
her
do
not
try
to
explain
anything
and
do
not
let
any
of
the
other
girls
hear
you
i
would
rather
they
did
not
know
about
it
sylvia
left
the
room
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
something
was
going
to
happen
of
that
she
was
sure
did
severn
who
had
been
in
china
himself
know
anything
about
mercy
relations
the
idea
was
so
overwhelming
and
so
delightful
that
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
ever
since
she
had
first
heard
mercy
story
she
had
been
hoping
that
some
clue
might
be
found
to
her
parentage
and
that
at
last
they
were
on
a
right
track
seemed
absolutely
too
good
to
be
true
she
found
her
friend
reading
in
the
garden
and
was
able
to
give
her
message
as
briefly
and
quietly
as
miss
kaye
had
desired
mercy
rose
at
once
and
asking
no
questions
went
to
her
bedroom
to
fetch
the
locket
then
rejoining
sylvia
who
had
waited
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
took
the
child
hand
and
walked
into
the
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
anxiety
for
all
mercy
dear
began
miss
kaye
after
a
moment
pause
as
if
she
hardly
knew
how
to
open
the
subject
we
had
agreed
that
it
was
wiser
not
to
speak
about
the
events
which
occurred
in
the
first
year
of
your
life
but
i
am
going
to
break
through
my
rule
severn
whom
you
met
this
afternoon
believes
that
he
can
throw
some
light
upon
your
early
history
and
even
solve
the
mystery
of
your
birth
from
what
he
tells
me
a
very
strange
chain
of
circumstances
has
led
him
to
make
enquiries
and
it
seems
more
than
probable
that
you
may
learn
something
at
last
try
and
calm
yourself
my
dear
child
and
let
severn
look
at
the
locket
which
you
have
brought
poor
mercy
was
trembling
with
agitation
was
her
hope
at
length
to
be
realized
ever
since
she
had
been
old
enough
to
notice
the
difference
between
herself
and
other
girls
she
had
looked
forward
to
this
at
first
with
eager
expectation
but
latterly
as
a
dream
never
likely
to
be
fulfilled
and
only
leading
to
perpetual
disappointment
all
the
cherished
castles
in
the
air
which
she
had
striven
so
bravely
to
put
away
from
her
all
the
longing
and
yearning
which
she
had
so
often
felt
for
those
unknown
parents
of
her
infancy
all
the
grief
the
solitude
and
the
shrinking
sense
of
her
lonely
position
rose
up
in
renewed
force
as
with
shaking
fingers
she
laid
her
chinese
charm
in
the
doctor
outstretched
hand
severn
had
removed
his
own
locket
from
his
watch
chain
and
he
now
placed
the
two
side
by
side
on
the
table
you
observe
miss
kaye
he
said
that
they
are
so
exactly
alike
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
them
apart
but
when
they
are
together
you
may
notice
that
there
is
a
slight
difference
in
the
characters
which
form
the
centre
to
one
unacquainted
with
chinese
it
is
perhaps
hardly
perceptible
but
if
you
had
any
knowledge
of
the
written
language
it
could
not
fail
to
strike
you
this
however
is
only
one
of
the
minor
points
i
have
still
to
make
the
great
test
he
took
his
own
locket
in
his
hand
and
pressed
a
secret
spring
it
opened
disclosing
inside
a
small
coloured
photograph
of
a
lady
with
a
sweet
face
and
fair
hair
at
which
he
asked
both
miss
kaye
and
mercy
to
look
carefully
he
then
lifted
the
other
locket
from
the
table
if
as
i
believe
this
is
the
true
duplicate
he
said
the
spring
will
be
here
and
it
will
open
like
its
fellow
the
three
spectators
held
their
breath
sylvia
was
white
as
a
ghost
and
miss
kaye
put
her
arm
round
mercy
to
prevent
her
from
falling
one
swift
pressure
of
the
doctor
thumb
and
the
charm
had
flown
open
revealing
an
exact
facsimile
of
the
former
portrait
severn
placed
the
pair
side
by
side
again
upon
the
table
and
turned
to
mercy
you
did
not
know
its
secret
he
asked
how
could
you
when
there
was
no
one
to
show
you
the
tiny
catch
you
have
seen
that
the
pictures
in
the
two
lockets
are
of
the
same
person
in
mine
it
is
of
my
beloved
wife
and
in
yours
it
is
the
portrait
of
your
mother
yes
mercy
you
are
indeed
my
daughter
given
back
as
it
seems
to
me
from
the
dead
and
after
all
these
years
of
our
separation
i
claim
you
thus
through
the
memory
of
one
by
whom
we
were
both
held
equally
dear
so
you
really
severn
own
daughter
it
almost
too
nice
to
believe
exclaimed
sylvia
a
few
minutes
later
when
mercy
with
an
april
face
and
kissed
her
and
thanked
her
for
her
share
in
bringing
about
her
happiness
it
is
true
nevertheless
replied
severn
the
locket
has
removed
every
shadow
of
doubt
there
is
still
however
a
great
deal
to
be
explained
and
with
miss
kaye
permission
i
will
relate
both
how
i
lost
my
child
and
why
i
had
apparently
made
no
effort
to
recover
her
it
is
a
long
story
but
for
a
full
understanding
of
the
facts
of
the
case
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
begin
at
the
beginning
it
is
now
more
than
twenty
years
ago
that
having
obtained
my
degree
as
a
doctor
of
medicine
and
held
appointments
at
various
hospitals
in
london
and
the
provinces
i
determined
to
devote
myself
to
the
mission
field
and
sailed
for
china
i
was
appointed
head
of
the
medical
mission
at
in
the
canton
of
and
on
arrival
there
i
bade
goodbye
to
western
civilization
in
those
days
the
people
of
china
were
even
more
ignorant
and
fanatical
than
they
are
now
the
prejudice
against
europeans
was
intense
and
for
a
long
time
our
best
efforts
seemed
thrown
away
i
should
have
been
very
disappointed
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cheery
hopeful
courage
of
my
wife
who
had
given
up
an
easy
life
in
england
to
help
the
cause
and
whose
work
among
the
chinese
women
was
the
beginning
of
the
ultimate
success
which
attended
our
mission
the
very
first
to
become
a
christian
was
a
woman
named
and
through
her
we
found
access
to
numerous
houses
the
doors
of
which
had
been
formerly
closed
against
us
our
small
church
began
to
grow
many
who
came
to
the
hospital
as
patients
would
listen
to
our
story
of
the
great
physician
and
tell
it
again
in
their
own
homes
i
wish
i
could
describe
to
you
our
life
in
that
strange
inland
chinese
city
we
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
which
was
the
nearest
british
settlement
and
travelling
was
so
difficult
and
so
slow
that
it
took
many
weeks
to
reach
the
coast
and
was
both
fatiguing
and
dangerous
we
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
could
in
the
house
which
had
been
built
under
my
directions
and
we
tried
to
grow
english
seeds
in
our
garden
to
remind
us
of
the
home
we
had
left
three
children
were
born
to
us
a
boy
named
edmund
and
twin
girls
whom
we
christened
mary
and
una
and
though
we
were
so
far
away
from
our
own
native
land
we
managed
to
be
a
very
happy
little
household
the
woman
was
our
nurse
and
as
devoted
to
the
babies
as
if
they
had
been
her
own
she
would
never
leave
them
for
an
instant
and
no
trouble
seemed
too
great
for
her
to
take
on
their
behalf
among
the
more
earnest
members
of
our
church
was
a
man
called
who
was
a
very
clever
carver
of
ivories
an
art
in
which
the
chinese
excel
i
had
been
able
to
cure
his
wife
of
a
painful
disease
and
he
was
anxious
to
give
me
a
present
of
some
of
his
own
work
one
day
therefore
he
brought
me
two
small
lockets
which
he
had
made
specially
for
my
two
little
girls
the
exquisite
threefold
tracery
of
the
border
was
intended
so
he
said
as
a
symbol
of
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
on
one
side
was
the
chinese
equivalent
for
luck
and
on
the
other
also
in
chinese
characters
the
names
mary
and
una
he
had
contrived
a
secret
spring
by
which
the
lockets
would
open
and
had
carved
inside
the
date
of
the
children
baptism
the
entire
western
part
of
the
idea
being
copied
from
a
trinket
we
possessed
in
the
house
which
had
once
shown
him
though
his
rendering
of
it
was
wholly
eastern
as
i
found
there
was
sufficient
space
in
each
to
contain
a
portrait
i
inserted
two
small
photographs
of
my
wife
which
i
had
taken
myself
and
coloured
and
to
show
our
appreciation
of
his
kindness
we
tied
his
gifts
round
the
babies
necks
with
pieces
of
ribbon
i
believe
poor
must
have
considered
them
to
be
some
kind
of
christian
charm
for
she
would
never
allow
them
to
be
taken
off
and
always
treated
them
as
if
they
were
objects
of
veneration
all
this
time
the
people
of
though
regarding
us
with
extreme
suspicion
had
never
yet
proved
themselves
to
be
absolutely
hostile
when
the
twins
were
nearly
a
year
old
however
we
began
to
notice
a
marked
change
in
the
demeanour
of
the
townsfolk
both
towards
us
and
the
mission
ugly
rumours
reached
us
of
riots
in
other
cities
and
cruelties
the
very
mention
of
which
was
enough
to
fill
one
with
horror
there
was
an
epidemic
of
disease
among
the
natives
caused
by
their
own
dirt
and
ignorance
of
the
common
laws
of
health
and
many
of
their
priests
had
spread
the
report
that
it
had
been
introduced
by
the
foreigners
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
their
numbers
and
thus
enabling
the
british
to
conquer
their
country
and
that
all
true
patriots
must
rise
and
destroy
the
source
of
the
evil
this
dangerous
doctrine
spread
rapidly
and
the
news
filled
me
with
the
greatest
uneasiness
i
hesitated
long
whether
i
ought
to
take
my
wife
and
children
to
the
coast
but
i
decided
that
the
danger
among
the
strangers
whom
we
should
be
forced
to
encounter
on
our
long
journey
was
even
greater
than
that
of
remaining
in
the
place
where
we
had
cured
many
sick
people
and
could
certainly
count
upon
obtaining
help
from
at
least
a
few
of
them
i
shall
never
forget
one
spring
morning
now
sixteen
years
ago
the
town
seemed
quiet
and
our
fears
had
been
somewhat
lulled
to
rest
i
had
finished
my
work
in
the
hospital
and
went
into
our
garden
where
my
wife
was
sitting
sewing
beside
our
three
little
ones
as
they
played
with
their
nurse
under
a
blossoming
tree
i
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
pretty
picture
they
made
the
three
little
rosy
english
faces
in
contrast
to
almond
eyes
and
smooth
black
tresses
the
gay
background
of
flowers
the
pagodas
of
the
temple
in
the
city
beyond
standing
out
against
the
brilliant
blue
sky
and
the
bright
sunshine
which
shone
on
my
wife
fair
hair
and
the
children
flaxen
heads
and
turned
them
all
to
gold
well
might
the
scene
live
in
my
memory
it
was
the
last
time
i
was
ever
to
see
them
thus
i
had
just
received
an
urgent
message
to
attend
a
mandarin
who
lived
many
miles
up
in
the
hills
and
who
now
lay
seriously
ill
and
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
me
everything
appeared
so
tranquil
that
i
thought
i
might
safely
leave
the
mission
for
a
short
period
and
i
made
preparations
to
set
off
at
once
taking
a
few
necessary
instruments
and
drugs
with
me
i
was
able
to
relieve
my
patient
and
was
about
to
start
for
home
when
to
my
anger
and
surprise
i
found
that
i
was
practically
a
prisoner
no
violence
was
offered
me
but
for
several
days
i
was
confined
in
a
room
from
which
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
and
in
spite
of
my
earnest
entreaties
my
jailer
would
give
me
no
reason
for
this
seemingly
poor
return
for
my
services
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
however
the
mandarin
sent
for
me
and
after
professing
himself
on
the
road
to
recovery
informed
me
that
a
terrible
massacre
of
christians
had
been
taking
place
and
if
he
had
not
afforded
me
the
safe
shelter
of
his
house
i
must
certainly
have
perished
among
the
rest
as
a
mark
of
his
gratitude
for
my
skilled
attendance
he
was
now
sending
me
to
the
coast
with
a
strong
escort
which
had
his
orders
to
convey
me
as
speedily
as
they
could
to
you
can
imagine
my
wild
alarm
at
this
terrible
news
and
my
anxiety
to
reach
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
the
mission
and
of
my
family
the
soldiers
on
the
whole
were
sympathetic
fellows
and
they
consented
to
march
by
the
hospital
though
they
assured
me
it
would
be
better
for
me
if
i
could
refrain
from
doing
so
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
to
you
the
scene
of
desolation
which
greeted
me
my
house
was
looted
and
wrecked
both
church
and
schools
were
a
pile
of
charred
ashes
and
all
my
workers
were
dead
not
one
seemed
to
have
escaped
the
general
catastrophe
in
the
ruins
of
what
had
once
been
my
beautiful
garden
i
found
my
wife
lying
with
our
little
una
in
her
arms
and
our
boy
close
to
her
side
they
had
evidently
been
trying
to
make
their
escape
when
they
were
followed
and
murdered
by
the
furious
mob
mary
i
had
no
doubt
had
also
perished
together
with
poor
faithful
and
our
other
servant
but
i
could
not
search
further
as
the
soldiers
obedient
to
their
orders
tore
me
away
from
the
terrible
scene
and
carried
me
more
dead
than
alive
to
the
coast
there
for
many
months
i
lay
stricken
down
with
brain
fever
and
it
was
not
until
after
more
than
a
rest
spent
mostly
in
japan
that
i
was
able
to
take
up
my
work
again
in
china
one
of
the
soldiers
with
kindly
thoughtfulness
had
cut
the
locket
from
little
una
neck
and
placed
it
amongst
my
possessions
perhaps
he
was
a
father
himself
and
i
think
that
my
grief
had
touched
him
it
contained
the
only
portrait
which
i
now
possessed
of
my
wife
and
for
this
reason
i
have
worn
it
always
upon
my
watch
chain
from
this
account
you
will
readily
understand
why
i
made
no
enquiries
for
my
other
child
believing
as
i
did
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
lived
my
long
illness
and
subsequent
absence
prevented
my
hearing
the
story
of
the
foundling
at
the
ingledew
hospital
perhaps
the
news
never
reached
my
remote
district
at
any
rate
by
the
time
i
returned
it
had
been
forgotten
among
the
many
heartrending
incidents
of
that
dreadful
uprising
it
was
no
doubt
who
had
managed
to
flee
with
her
nursling
though
i
still
can
not
understand
why
she
should
have
travelled
the
immense
distance
from
to
unless
she
were
trying
to
reach
the
home
of
her
parents
who
i
understood
came
from
a
different
province
where
she
was
wounded
or
what
horrors
and
cruelties
she
encountered
we
shall
never
know
since
she
paid
for
her
devotion
with
her
life
for
fourteen
years
more
i
remained
in
the
canton
of
then
owing
to
my
broken
health
i
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
give
up
my
work
there
and
return
to
england
the
death
of
an
uncle
had
left
me
in
easy
circumstances
and
finding
the
climate
of
north
wales
suited
me
i
bought
dale
side
and
settled
down
there
with
the
intention
of
writing
a
book
on
the
many
modern
problems
of
china
and
its
future
development
a
subject
on
which
i
thought
i
was
competent
to
express
an
opinion
it
was
not
until
sylvia
spoke
of
the
facsimile
of
my
locket
owned
by
her
schoolfellow
and
until
she
had
told
me
the
story
of
how
mercy
was
left
at
the
ingledew
hospital
that
it
ever
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
possible
for
my
little
mary
to
have
survived
the
general
massacre
and
even
then
i
put
the
idea
aside
as
romantic
and
absurd
it
haunted
me
however
to
such
an
extent
that
i
determined
to
go
over
to
aberglyn
and
make
a
few
private
enquiries
from
miss
kaye
on
the
subject
when
i
first
saw
mercy
i
was
struck
at
once
by
her
likeness
to
my
dead
wife
and
the
locket
soon
proved
to
my
entire
satisfaction
that
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
conjectures
all
the
dates
exactly
correspond
and
i
think
there
will
now
be
no
difficulty
in
convincing
everybody
of
her
identity
it
is
indeed
a
very
strange
and
happy
ending
to
a
sad
story
said
miss
kaye
wiping
her
eyes
mercy
on
her
part
has
gone
through
a
time
of
trial
which
i
am
sure
has
done
its
work
in
helping
to
form
her
character
she
has
been
much
to
us
in
the
school
and
i
could
not
hand
over
a
sweeter
daughter
to
a
more
worthy
father
then
she
is
mary
severn
now
instead
of
mercy
ingledew
exclaimed
sylvia
she
was
baptized
mary
said
severn
but
we
will
call
her
mercy
still
no
fitter
name
could
have
been
chosen
it
was
mercy
that
saved
her
life
mercy
that
preserved
her
during
all
the
years
we
were
apart
mercy
that
brought
about
our
marvellous
meeting
and
it
is
mercy
that
has
given
her
back
to
me
at
last
chapter
xix
the
prize
giving
all
the
school
was
delighted
at
mercy
good
fortune
but
no
one
more
so
than
sylvia
to
feel
that
severn
discovery
was
indirectly
due
to
herself
was
an
unbounded
satisfaction
i
always
wanted
so
much
to
discover
mercy
friends
she
said
to
linda
and
is
it
strange
that
when
i
believed
i
found
her
mother
it
was
just
a
silly
mistake
and
when
i
really
found
her
father
i
did
suspect
it
in
the
least
i
never
dreamt
of
severn
being
a
relation
even
when
i
saw
his
locket
was
the
same
as
mercy
you
see
mercy
said
it
was
a
chinese
charm
so
i
thought
perhaps
they
were
quite
common
like
the
tassel
he
been
showing
you
and
anybody
who
been
in
china
might
have
one
suppose
i
had
come
to
stay
with
you
at
whitsuntide
or
we
had
gone
to
tea
that
afternoon
you
would
have
noticed
that
locket
because
mercy
had
shown
hers
to
you
and
if
you
told
severn
about
her
being
found
he
never
have
guessed
it
was
his
own
mary
i
do
think
anything
you
could
have
offered
me
in
the
whole
world
would
have
made
me
gladder
than
this
there
was
only
one
flaw
in
sylvia
happiness
mercy
who
was
now
seventeen
was
to
leave
heathercliffe
house
to
be
mistress
of
dale
side
both
miss
kaye
and
severn
thought
her
right
place
was
with
her
father
and
that
her
schooldays
might
fitly
come
to
a
close
i
could
part
from
her
again
said
the
doctor
not
even
to
send
her
to
so
short
a
distance
as
aberglyn
we
still
to
learn
to
know
each
other
and
the
more
we
in
each
other
company
the
better
i
can
arrange
for
visiting
masters
to
give
her
lessons
in
painting
and
music
but
she
such
a
tall
girl
i
feel
she
almost
a
woman
and
will
soon
begin
to
take
care
of
me
instead
of
allowing
me
to
take
care
of
her
to
sylvia
mercy
absence
would
leave
a
great
blank
but
she
was
consoled
when
severn
promised
that
she
should
be
their
first
visitor
and
that
he
would
ask
her
mother
to
allow
her
to
spend
part
of
the
august
holidays
with
them
at
craigwen
where
linda
and
her
brothers
would
be
able
to
join
them
constantly
for
walks
and
excursions
there
was
little
more
of
the
summer
term
left
for
anyone
at
heathercliffe
house
the
few
remaining
weeks
passed
quickly
by
and
brought
the
annual
garden
party
and
prize
giving
with
which
miss
kaye
always
celebrated
the
breaking
up
it
was
the
great
occasion
of
the
school
year
and
many
of
the
girls
parents
came
over
to
aberglyn
on
purpose
to
be
present
the
day
fortunately
proved
fine
and
all
the
pupils
found
themselves
in
such
effervescent
spirits
that
the
mistresses
had
a
hard
task
to
keep
their
attention
during
the
morning
classes
connie
camden
sit
up
straight
and
place
your
feet
together
said
miss
arkwright
i
can
not
allow
you
to
have
your
arm
round
waist
even
if
it
is
the
last
day
linda
put
that
lozenge
in
your
pocket
if
i
see
it
again
i
will
take
it
from
you
marian
tie

hair

lost
your
place

times

told
you
not
to
touch
nina
ruler
nina
shut
your
pencil
box
at
once
now
jessie
begin
again
and
parse
more
carefully
antelope
is
not
an
abstract
noun
it
was
certainly
difficult
to
recall
the
rules
of
grammar
when
the
girls
remembered
that
this
was
actually
the
very
last
lesson
and
that
for
seven
whole
weeks
their
books
would
be
lying
idle
the
schoolrooms
would
be
deserted
the
blackboard
and
maps
put
away
and
they
themselves
would
be
enjoying
the
country
or
seaside
in
company
with
their
respective
families
even
marian
answered
at
random
and
poor
miss
arkwright
was
getting
into
despair
when
fortunately
for
all
the
bell
rang
and
they
were
at
liberty
to
disperse
there
was
still
enough
discipline
left
to
cause
the
class
to
walk
decorously
through
the
door
but
once
outside
in
the
passage
they
danced
about
like
a
little
crew
of
savages
and
tearing
downstairs
ran
into
the
garden
to
work
off
their
excitement
leaving
their
teacher
standing
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
her
open
desk
to
put
the
last
marks
to
their
now
finished
exercise
books
we
going
to
whitby
for
the
holidays
said
connie
we
taken
a
furnished
house
and
our
cousins
are
coming
to
stay
next
door
there
are
eight
of
them
and
eleven
of
us
so
sha
we
just
have
a
jolly
time
hurrah
we
off
to
scotland
said
nina
and
mother
promised
i
may
take
all
the
coach
rides
that
the
others
do
i
have
had
a
cold
now
since
easter
do
boast

brenda
or

sure
to
catch
one
this
afternoon
and
miss
kaye
put
you
to
bed
and
say
you
are
well
enough
to
travel
she
sha
declared
nina
indignantly
i
would
stay
there
get
up
and
go
home
if
i
were
coughing
and
sneezing
till
i
could
see
out
of
my
eyes
then
they
roll
you
up
in
a
blanket
said
connie
who
loved
to
tease
with
a
shawl
tied
over
your
head
and
carry
you
down
to
a
cab
as
they
did
with
rosie
when
she
began
with
chicken
pox
and
was
sent
to
the
fever
hospital
you
have
to
travel
in
the
luggage
van
because
everybody
think
you
infectious
and
wo
have
you
in
their
carriage
the
doctor
go
with
you
and
keep
taking
your
temperature
and
feeling
your
pulse
and
telling
you
to
put
out
your
tongue
and
listening
at
your
bronchial
tube
all
the
time
he
wo
be
able
to
hear
much
though
because
of
the
rattling
of
the
train
perhaps
take
it
for
the
rattling
of
your
breath
and
think
you
very
bad
it
be
a
most
exciting
journey
for
you
you
horrid
girl
i
have
caught
the
cold
yet
and
i
do
mean
to
said
nina
pursuing
connie
who
dodged
away
round
the
summer
house
calling
out
as
a
parting
shot
be
sure
to
let
us
know
how
many
bottles
of
medicine
you
take
i
travelled
in
the
guard
van
once
said
jessie
ellis
mother
could
bring
me
to
school
herself
and
nobody
we
knew
was
going
to
wales
either
so
the
guard
took
me
with
him
i
rather
liked
it
there
was
such
a
lovely
big
window
and
he
let
me
look
at
a
kitten
that
somebody
was
sending
in
a
basket
and
when
we
stopped
at
chester
he
got
me
a
glass
of
milk
from
the
refreshment
room
i
going
straight
to
llandudno
we
to
stay
there
for
three
weeks
my
brother
school
broke
up
yesterday
and
he
coming
here
with
father
and
mother
this
afternoon
what
are
you
going
to
do
marian
asked
linda
i
not
quite
sure
we
wanted
the
isle
of
man
but
it
such
a
trouble
to
take
the
little
ones
on
the
steamer
we
have
to
choose
a
nice
safe
place
where
there
sand
for
them
to
dig
and
the
tide
does
come
in
too
fast
gwennie
was
nearly
drowned
at
arnside
when
she
was
five
and
it
made
mother
so
nervous
ever
since
i
going
to
learn
the
bicycle
said
brenda
my
eldest
promised
to
lend
me
hers
and
lower
the
saddle
if
i
can
manage
well
enough
to
ride
on
the
road
i
to
go
with
ada
and
willie
to
ashmere
and
that
eight
miles
off
but
father
dreadfully
afraid
of
motor
cars
hazel
is
coming
home
this
summer
aunt
cicely
taking
her
a
tour
in
switzerland
is
she
lucky
all
the
members
of
the
third
class
had
promised
faithfully
to
correspond
with
one
another
and
sylvia
suggested
that
they
should
each
keep
a
diary
of
their
adventures
to
be
read
aloud
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
which
had
languished
during
the
summer
but
which
they
intended
to
take
up
with
renewed
vigour
when
the
days
began
to
close
in
once
more
everybody
must
agree
to
send
everybody
else
at
least
two
picture
postcards
said
linda
and
then
we
can
compare
them
when
we
come
back
to
school
yes
if
one
mother
will
pay
for
them
said
connie
who
had
returned
to
the
lawn
mine
struck
last
holidays
and
said
eleven
children
all
wanting
stamps
continually
was
ruining
her
and
we
must
buy
our
own
postcards
are
a
penny
each
and
they
need
halfpenny
stamps
so
it
cost
exactly
one
and
ninepence
to
send
two
to
every
one
of
you
i
ca
possibly
afford
it
not
if
i
want
any
donkey
rides
or
chocolates
the
others
laughed
the
comfortable
assurance
that
mother
will
pay
held
by
most
boys
and
girls
had
not
caused
them
to
think
of
the
expense
and
connie
calculations
were
startling
well
of
course
if
you
ca
you
ca
said
linda
and
we
expect
them
you
may
write
a
kind
of
letter
and
send
it
to
me
and
i
send
it
to
somebody
else
who
pass
it
on
to
the
next
that
only
take
you
one
stamp
and
you
must
go
without
a
pennyworth
of
chocolates
the
guests
were
to
arrive
at
three
and
the
moment
dinner
was
over
the
girls
hurried
to
their
bedrooms
for
the
very
important
ceremony
of
changing
their
dresses
linda
thick
straight
brown
locks
had
been
wetted
and
plaited
in
the
tightest
possible
braids
the
night
before
to
give
it
the
required
wave
nina
forster
had
even
tried
the
experiment
of
screwing
hers
up
in
curl
papers
but
the
hard
round
knobs
had
stuck
into
her
head
and
made
her
too
uncomfortable
to
sleep
so
after
tossing
about
uneasily
for
an
hour
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
had
pulled
them
out
with
a
solemn
vow
to
relinquish
the
idea
of
ringlets
in
the
future
marian
whose
long
beautiful
auburn
hair
was
generally
brushed
stiffly
back
from
her
face
and
worn
in
a
neat
pigtail
left
it
loose
for
once
and
allowed
gwennie
to
tie
it
with
two
large
bows
of
ribbon
to
match
her
sash
an
alteration
much
appreciated
by
the
girls
who
declared
they
scarcely
recognized
her
connie
had
little
vanity
and
being
arrayed
the
first
of
anybody
she
flitted
about
among
the
various
bedrooms
like
a
small
moth
giving
free
criticisms
of
the
costumes
yes
that
a
very
pretty
dress
linda
she
remarked
white
muslin
over
a
pink
slip
suits
you
though
it
rather
reminds
me
of
a
or
a
baby
cradle
all
the
same
i
want
to
hang
a
pin
cushion
on
to
you
sylvia
if
you
grown
another
have
had
to
let
down
a
tuck
i
like
the
little
daisy
pattern
and
the
rows
of
narrow
lace
they
rather
sweet
you
must
wear
the
daisy
brooch
you
got
on
your
birthday
you
should
see
brenda
her
dress
was
so
stiffly
starched
i
could
fasten
it
for
her
i
had
to
fetch
mercy
and
she
opened
the
buttonholes
with
a
pair
of
scissors
jessie
ellis
has
on
a
silk
and
she
almost
afraid
to
sit
down
for
fear
of
soiling
it
i
hate
things
that
wo
ta
ta
going
to
see
marian
gwennie
spilled
a
whole
bottle
of
scent
over
her
clean
muslin
but
luckily
her
other
had
just
come
back
from
the
laundry
she
sewing
the
buttons
on
it
now
the
girls
were
allowed
to
go
into
the
garden
to
await
their
friends
and
kept
up
an
excited
commentary
on
the
list
of
arrivals
there
marian
mother
and
she
brought
a
little
one
with
her
such
a
darling
the
image
of
gwennie
only
far
prettier
that
must
be
ellis
and
jessie
brother
how
terribly
shy
he
looks
i
wonder
the
only
boy
in
a
girl
school
that
sybil
lake
eldest
sister
she
used
to
come
here
herself
once
there
cameron
i
thought
he
would
stay
away
and
there
are
and
fenwick
and
miss
winnie
i
wish
cecil
had
come
too
who
are
these
who
just
got
out
of
a
cab
father
and
mother
replied
sylvia
jumping
to
her
feet
and
why
surely
they
brought
aunt
louisa
with
them
it
was
actually
aunt
louisa
herself
who
was
shaking
hands
cordially
with
miss
kaye
and
gazing
about
her
with
a
complacent
expression
as
if
she
were
remembering
that
it
was
all
due
to
her
persuasions
that
her
niece
was
a
pupil
at
heathercliffe
house
and
congratulating
herself
still
upon
the
wisdom
of
her
plan
she
greeted
sylvia
most
affectionately
asked
which
were
linda
and
mercy
had
quite
a
pleasant
chat
with
miss
arkwright
on
the
subject
of
education
and
seemed
altogether
to
be
enjoying
herself
immensely
sylvia
was
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
introducing
her
father
and
mother
to
and
marshall
and
severn
who
were
among
the
guests
and
she
was
not
satisfied
till
she
had
taken
them
the
entire
round
of
the
house
and
garden
that
they
might
see
for
themselves
the
places
she
had
so
often
described
tea
was
served
in
the
garden
the
girls
helping
to
pass
cups
and
hand
plates
luckily
without
any
mishaps
though
connie
camden
nearly
upset
the
cream
which
was
only
saved
through
the
quickness
of
may
spencer
and
little
greta
collins
who
had
been
told
to
carry
round
a
sugar
basin
offered
it
to
cameron
and
as
he
was
too
busy
talking
to
notice
her
dropped
three
lumps
into
his
cup
and
went
away
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
him
when
he
discovered
it
as
he
did
not
take
sugar
sadie
and
elsie
thompson
were
supremely
happy
in
the
possession
of
their
father
whose
ship
had
arrived
at
liverpool
just
in
time
to
allow
him
to
come
to
the
prize
giving
it
was
quite
pathetic
to
see
how
they
clung
to
his
hands
and
would
scarcely
let
him
out
of
their
sight
the
whole
afternoon
and
the
girls
were
glad
to
hear
that
he
was
going
to
take
the
two
children
away
for
a
short
holiday
without
the
guardianship
of
the
stern
aunt
we
to
go
to
liverpool
first
said
elsie
gleefully
to
sylvia
and
daddy
show
us
all
over
his
big
ship
we
see
the
engines
and
the
compass
and
his
cabin
and
we
to
have
tea
on
the
upper
deck
he
says
we
may
talk
through
his
speaking
trumpet
and
sound
the
foghorn
and
turn
the
wheel
just
a
tiny
piece
then
we
going
a
long
way
in
the
train
to
stay
at
a
farm
in
the
country
quite
alone
with
daddy
wo
it
be
fun
he
going
to
send
you
an
indian
necklace
because
we
told
him
you
been
so
kind
to
us
and
your
mother
sent
us
such
a
lovely
cake
on
sadie
birthday
he
got
it
locked
up
in
his
cabin
on
the
ship
but
i
do
think
i
ought
to
have
told
you
it
to
be
a
surprise
miss
kaye
had
allowed
a
full
hour
for
tea
and
talk
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
guests
were
asked
to
assemble
in
the
large
schoolroom
for
the
distribution
of
prizes
which
were
to
be
given
away
by
the
rector
of
aberglyn
the
room
was
prettily
decorated
with
flowers
and
on
a
table
at
one
end
lay
a
number
of
handsomely
bound
books
the
children
were
obliged
reluctantly
to
be
separated
from
their
parents
as
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
sit
in
classes
and
once
more
the
members
of
the
third
form
found
themselves
side
by
side
edwards
the
rector
made
a
short
opening
speech
complimenting
both
teachers
and
pupils
on
a
year
of
industrious
work
and
said
what
pleasure
it
gave
him
to
see
the
rows
of
bright
happy
young
faces
before
him
and
to
know
how
much
they
had
learnt
at
heathercliffe
house
he
reminded
them
of
the
high
standard
in
right
and
honour
as
well
as
knowledge
which
it
was
miss
kaye
object
to
maintain
there
and
begged
them
to
make
the
best
possible
use
of
their
schooldays
upon
which
he
declared
they
would
often
look
back
as
the
happiest
time
in
their
lives
there
were
no
competitive
prizes
among
the
little
ones
each
of
whom
was
called
up
to
receive
a
small
present
for
good
conduct
and
when
the
rector
had
made
some
kindly
remarks
he
turned
to
the
third
class
the
prizes
were
awarded
according
to
the
result
of
the
examination
and
of
all
the
weekly
marks
gained
during
the
year
the
totals
being
added
together
it
was
therefore
a
test
both
of
correct
memory
and
of
steady
application
and
would
show
that
the
winner
had
worked
hard
for
her
laurels
the
class
knew
that
it
must
lie
between
marian
and
sylvia
no
one
else
had
the
slightest
chance
and
the
girls
gazed
eagerly
at
edwards
waiting
for
the
important
announcement
he
held
a
beautifully
illustrated
edition
of
in
his
hand
this
is
the
prize
for
english
he
said
and
i
have
much
pleasure
in
presenting
it
to
sylvia
lindsay
who
i
am
sure
must
have
worked
with
the
greatest
industry
to
gain
it
and
thoroughly
deserves
her
success
everybody
clapped
as
sylvia
walked
up
the
room
to
receive
her
book
and
she
herself
could
scarcely
believe
her
good
fortune
she
had
never
really
expected
to
win
and
for
the
moment
her
triumph
was
sweet
poor
marian
whose
face
had
fallen
at
the
news
joined
nevertheless
in
the
applause
and
sylvia
in
her
turn
was
able
to
give
her
a
hearty
clap
as
the
rector
declared
her
to
be
the
best
french
scholar
and
awarded
her
a
copy
of
lafontaine
nina
took
the
music
prize
and
gwennie
the
one
for
neatness
punctuality
and
general
orderliness
which
completed
the
list
for
the
third
class
and
edwards
went
on
to
the
second
class
ending
with
the
first
where
mercy
very
appropriately
came
out
head
of
the
school
sylvia
felt
as
if
her
brain
were
in
a
whirl
it
was
all
as
she
had
wished
she
held
her
reward
in
her
hand
and
her
father
and
mother
had
been
there
to
see
her
claim
it
surely
life
could
contain
no
greater
joy
but
who
was
standing
up
now
to
make
the
closing
speech
it
was
severn
and
everyone
who
knew
his
story
and
mercy
was
anxious
to
hear
him
he
said
only
a
few
quiet
words
but
they
were
so
concise
and
to
the
point
that
they
lived
for
many
years
in
the
memories
of
some
of
those
who
listened
to
them
after
congratulating
the
girls
who
had
taken
prizes
and
urging
all
to
fresh
efforts
he
spoke
to
those
who
had
tried
and
had
been
unsuccessful
the
greatest
deeds
in
the
world
he
said
have
often
been
done
by
people
who
have
failed
not
only
once
but
many
times
yet
have
never
let
themselves
be
discouraged
do
stop
trying
but
on
the
other
hand
do
look
at
the
prize
as
the
chief
end
of
your
striving
a
poor
thing
after
all
compared
with
the
gain
to
your
character
that
every
honest
endeavour
will
bring
you
remember
too
that
we
all
have
the
post
of
honour
somebody
has
to
stand
aside
and
take
second
best
and
the
one
who
can
do
it
the
most
bravely
and
generously
is
winning
what
is
far
more
worth
having
than
a
prettily
bound
book
you
learn
many
lessons
at
heathercliffe
house
but
believe
me
the
greatest
of
them
is
the
power
to
give
up
your
own
way
sometimes
and
to
be
happy
in
the
pleasure
and
success
of
others
it
may
seem
easy
just
at
first
but
i
can
assure
you
it
brings
the
best
and
most
lasting
happiness
in
the
end
i
read
a
few
lines
a
day
or
two
ago
that
explain
just
what
i
mean
so
i
going
to
say
them
to
you
chiefest
duty
here
below
is
not
the
seeming
great
to
do
that
the
vain
world
may
pause
to
see
but
in
steadfast
humility
to
walk
the
common
walk
and
bear
the
thousand
things
the
trifling
care
in
love
with
wisdom
patiently
thus
each
one
in
his
narrow
groove
the
great
world
nearer
god
may
move
as
sylvia
listened
her
small
triumph
seemed
to
fade
away
into
something
higher
and
better
and
almost
unconsciously
she
and
marian
clasped
hands
their
rivalry
forgotten
in
a
nobler
ideal
all
the
events
of
the
school
year
passed
rapidly
through
her
memory
she
was
changed
greatly
from
the
rather
selfish
little
girl
who
had
given
so
cold
a
welcome
to
her
guests
at
that
party
and
as
her
mother
afterwards
kissed
her
and
praised
her
for
her
success
it
was
with
a
heartfelt
meaning
in
her
words
that
she
said
i
did
try
hard
the
whole
time
just
to
please
you
and
father
i
did
want
to
come
to
school
at
all
but
i
glad
you
made
me
i
like
it
now
most
immensely

simply
