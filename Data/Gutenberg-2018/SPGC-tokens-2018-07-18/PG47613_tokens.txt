the

the
high
school
at
cloverfield
was
quiet
as
the
hands
of
the
clock
approached
the
clock
hour
then
a
gong
pealed
out
and
the
building
became
a
very
beehive
of
sound
the
thump
of
many
feet
and
the
hum
of
voices
was
heard
healthy
wholesome
young
boys
and
girls
poured
out
of
the
side
doors
and
swarmed
over
the
campus
overcoats
were
pulled
tighter
as
the
nip
of
the
keen
vermont
air
was
encountered
two
boys
had
come
out
together
and
they
paused
to
wait
for
two
others
the
boy
with
the
manly
face
and
the
sparkling
eyes
was
barry
garrison
an
outstanding
boy
in
the
cloverfield
high
school
he
had
been
the
right
halfback
on
the
school
team
this
year
and
had
helped
to
lead
it
to
a
glorious
record
of
no
defeats
and
first
place
on
the
conference
list
he
was
an
athlete
and
stood
well
in
his
studies
although
barry
garrison
would
have
turned
the
idea
aside
with
a
laugh
he
was
the
most
popular
boy
in
the
high
school
his
lifelong
chum
was
kent
marple
kent
s
father
owned
the
local
hotel
and
the
boy
had
enjoyed
many
advantages
in
life
he
and
barry
had
been
friends
ever
since
they
had
been
small
boys
young
marple
was
broader
than
barry
with
a
heavy
shock
of
black
hair
and
a
chin
that
was
a
trifle
determined
he
had
played
fullback
on
the
football
team
during
the
past
season
these
two
boys
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
hurry
barry
leaned
against
a
maple
tree
and
whistled
softly
while
kent
glanced
from
one
side
door
of
the
school
to
the
other
the
twins
must
have
been
kept
in
barry
observed
maybe
they
are
clapping
erasers
for
the
teacher
kent
grinned
if
they
are
they
ll
clap
em
clean
barry
laughed
the
ford
twins
always
finish
what
they
start
here
they
come
two
boys
came
springing
down
the
steps
of
the
school
building
and
looked
around
for
barry
and
kent
when
they
had
seen
their
particular
friends
one
of
them
waved
and
then
both
boys
dashed
across
the
hard
ground
toward
the
boys
under
the
trees
at
first
glance
there
was
little
to
distinguish
between
mac
and
tim
ford
they
were
both
the
same
height
and
build
stocky
young
fellows
who
had
made
splendid
ends
on
the
team
but
at
closer
range
some
differences
were
apparent
mac
was
and
tim
was
gifted
with
a
light
brown
mass
of
hair
that
sometimes
managed
to
stay
combed
both
boys
had
attractive
lively
countenances
and
were
well
liked
by
everyone
in
the
small
town
they
were
often
the
leaders
in
the
fun
and
could
always
be
counted
on
to
join
in
any
kind
of
a
lark
with
kent
and
barry
they
made
up
a
quartet
that
was
widely
known
mac
ford
beat
his
brother
to
the
maple
tree
by
a
yard
thought
we
never
would
get
out
he
panted
took
tim
s
advice
in
a
problem
and
it
was
wrong
had
to
do
it
the
trouble
is
that
you
take
my
advice
tim
denied
i
tried
to
show
you
how
to
work
it
never
mind
barry
interposed
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
sweater
pockets
let
s
move
along
it
s
cold
it
ought
to
be
kent
observed
christmas
is
almost
two
boys
and
a
girl
passed
them
and
nodded
and
smiled
there
they
go
the
girl
cried
the
mystery
hunters
four
sherlocks
the
detectives
chimed
in
one
of
the
boys
when
this
trio
had
passed
on
the
four
chums
looked
at
one
another
they
seem
to
keep
calling
us
the
mystery
hunters
barry
smiled
just
because
we
found
out
who
was
stealing
things
out
of
the
lockers
grunted
tim
that
wasn
t
such
a
big
anybody
could
have
done
it
if
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
kent
said
the
biggest
surprise
about
the
whole
thing
was
the
fact
that
a
boy
like
carter
wolf
was
doing
it
mac
put
in
proceeding
slowly
along
the
sidewalk
toward
home
the
four
boys
once
more
discussed
the
recent
events
which
had
resulted
in
earning
the
name
of
mystery
for
a
long
time
someone
had
been
stealing
athletic
supplies
and
even
rings
and
watches
from
the
gymnasium
locker
room
persistent
efforts
had
been
made
to
trap
the
thief
but
without
success
finally
the
four
boys
had
entered
the
case
chiefly
because
a
birthday
ring
of
mac
s
had
been
among
the
things
taken
but
for
a
long
time
they
had
not
made
any
progress
the
prowler
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
they
were
about
they
even
tried
sleeping
in
the
locker
room
but
even
this
produced
no
results
finally
they
decided
on
strategy
and
rigged
up
a
camera
this
was
placed
in
another
room
at
a
place
in
the
wall
where
a
single
brick
had
been
knocked
out
the
locker
doors
were
hooked
up
in
such
a
way
that
when
one
of
them
was
opened
the
camera
would
operate
they
got
immediate
results
with
this
and
on
the
day
they
took
the
camera
down
a
certain
wealthy
boy
named
carter
wolf
left
school
the
negative
when
developed
showed
that
carter
wolf
was
the
guilty
one
his
startled
face
was
turned
toward
the
camera
whose
click
he
had
heard
and
one
hand
was
plainly
seen
opening
a
locker
door
at
first
he
denied
the
charges
but
finally
he
had
made
good
the
losses
in
one
way
or
another
mac
was
lucky
enough
to
get
his
ring
back
but
others
found
that
their
property
had
been
sold
to
pay
gambling
debts
that
wolf
had
contracted
only
the
influence
and
pleading
of
his
father
had
saved
the
boy
from
the
punishment
he
richly
deserved
for
the
time
being
he
had
disappeared
from
the
community
but
not
until
he
had
left
a
threat
behind
him
i
ll
even
scores
with
that
barry
garrison
bunch
he
had
promised
with
the
identification
of
the
mysterious
sneak
thief
a
wave
of
relief
had
swept
over
cloverfield
high
school
the
teachers
and
students
were
grateful
to
the
four
boys
whose
persistence
had
finally
caught
the
prowler
the
title
of
mystery
hunters
had
been
given
them
and
the
boys
knew
that
under
it
lay
a
genuine
admiration
for
the
piece
of
work
that
they
had
done
when
you
figure
it
all
out
kent
declared
as
they
stopped
a
moment
before
the
brownstone
house
in
which
barry
lived
there
wasn
t
much
to
it
maybe
there
would
be
a
different
story
if
we
ever
ran
up
against
a
real
mysteries
are
few
and
far
between
tim
said
let
s
talk
about
something
more
vital
we
ll
have
about
ten
days
of
vacation
at
christmas
time
what
ll
we
do
with
it
eat
popcorn
and
candy
off
the
christmas
tree
mac
grinned
our
tree
won
t
have
enough
on
to
keep
us
eating
very
long
tim
answered
shall
we
do
a
little
winter
camping
either
that
or
hunt
some
barry
agreed
let
s
give
it
some
thought
in
the
next
few
the
other
boys
went
on
down
the
street
while
barry
turned
in
at
the
door
of
the
brownstone
house
kent
lived
two
doors
beyond
and
the
twins
lived
around
the
corner
in
a
big
frame
house
the
fords
were
not
among
the
wealthiest
people
in
the
town
although
ford
did
have
a
fairly
good
business
in
dry
goods
but
they
were
a
fine
family
and
kent
and
barry
had
been
fond
of
the
two
lively
boys
since
days
as
barry
entered
the
hall
his
sister
pearl
was
going
up
the
stairs
in
the
library
to
the
right
of
him
he
could
see
his
father
seated
under
a
lamp
reading
a
magazine
the
rattling
of
a
pan
on
the
stove
told
him
where
his
mother
was
pearl
was
in
her
first
year
of
high
school
and
had
preceded
him
home
by
several
minutes
she
paused
a
moment
on
the
upper
landing
to
address
him
here
is
the
chief
of
the
mystery
hunters
she
called
cheerfully
do
you
know
that
everybody
is
calling
you
that
yes
i
know
it
he
nodded
i
wish
they
would
forget
garrison
looked
up
from
his
magazine
i
need
some
real
mystery
hunters
right
now
he
said
if
you
want
to
take
on
a
real
puzzler
come
barry
was
at
once
interested
his
father
was
a
lawyer
and
frequently
handled
important
cases
the
boy
placed
his
books
on
a
hall
table
and
walked
into
the
library
what
s
it
all
about
dad
what
mystery
are
you
talking
about
garrison
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
his
eyes
i
was
thinking
about
that
haunted
hunting
lodge
up
on
lake
arrowtip
he
said
but
i
was
only
joking
when
i
told
you
to
come
ahead
it
is
a
job
that
will
test
the
brains
of
an
expert
chapter
ii
the
story
of
the
haunted
lodge
barry
sat
down
in
one
of
the
big
chairs
and
faced
his
father
garrison
had
put
his
magazine
aside
and
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
his
son
a
haunted
lodge
dad
where
is
it
what
haunts
it
the
lawyer
laughed
one
question
at
a
time
son
i
knew
that
you
would
want
to
know
about
it
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
that
it
was
haunted
or
supposed
to
be
haunted
because
of
course
it
isn
then
what
makes
people
say
that
it
is
tell
me
something
about
it
dad
where
is
it
located
on
lake
arrowtip
right
about
the
middle
of
the
lake
on
a
high
bluff
that
commands
a
magnificent
view
up
and
down
the
big
sheet
of
water
it
is
the
hunting
lodge
that
belongs
to
morganson
one
of
my
clients
some
years
ago
she
had
that
fine
big
lodge
built
and
used
to
go
up
there
once
in
a
while
herself
though
she
hasn
t
been
there
in
late
years
you
know
lake
arrowtip
fairly
well
don
t
you
yes
i
ve
hiked
and
camped
up
there
with
kent
and
the
twins
i
think
i
know
where
that
lodge
is
isn
t
it
a
big
log
house
with
a
porch
looking
out
over
the
lake
off
in
the
direction
of
rake
island
yes
that
is
the
place
ever
been
in
it
no
but
we
ve
passed
it
in
a
canoe
there
was
a
party
at
the
lodge
at
the
time
there
is
another
cabin
close
by
a
small
log
yes
that
is
the
bronson
cabin
it
is
owned
by
a
retired
lawyer
friend
of
mine
and
he
never
uses
it
any
more
it
is
very
close
to
the
well
tell
me
about
this
mystery
dad
do
the
people
around
there
think
the
place
is
haunted
there
aren
t
very
many
people
around
there
to
think
that
but
some
of
our
town
people
won
t
go
to
the
place
i
suppose
you
remember
that
morganson
s
nephew
disappeared
up
there
over
a
year
ago
and
has
never
been
barry
slung
one
leg
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
i
do
remember
hearing
something
about
that
he
replied
wasn
t
he
kidnaped
and
carried
off
to
canada
somewhere
it
seemed
so
his
father
nodded
there
was
one
letter
from
canada
telling
his
aunt
not
to
worry
that
he
was
being
well
treated
but
no
trace
of
him
has
ever
been
discovered
and
some
splendid
detectives
have
been
looking
for
felix
morganson
well
since
the
time
that
he
disappeared
things
haven
t
been
going
well
at
bluff
is
that
when
the
haunting
began
barry
asked
a
little
later
than
that
you
see
felix
morganson
disappeared
during
a
thanksgiving
party
at
the
lodge
there
was
quite
a
crowd
at
the
lodge
and
they
were
enjoying
a
gathering
at
the
time
along
about
ten
o
clock
or
so
at
night
morganson
walked
out
of
the
place
smoking
a
cigarette
several
saw
him
go
but
no
one
asked
him
where
or
why
he
was
going
as
time
went
on
they
missed
him
and
finally
some
of
the
men
walked
out
on
the
bluff
which
overlooks
the
lake
following
his
footsteps
in
the
light
snow
that
had
fallen
close
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
they
found
the
snow
kicked
and
scuffed
up
and
his
cigarette
only
partially
smoked
then
there
were
long
dragging
marks
in
the
snow
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
been
pulled
along
down
the
path
to
the
lake
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
at
that
point
because
the
lake
was
frozen
over
and
the
ice
was
as
smooth
as
barry
was
absorbed
in
the
story
no
one
in
the
lodge
heard
anything
no
outcry
or
anything
his
father
shook
his
head
no
but
that
same
night
a
servant
a
frenchman
disappeared
he
was
a
man
that
had
been
hired
to
cook
and
to
wait
on
the
tables
and
this
man
was
gone
no
one
knows
whether
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
all
or
not
but
he
left
the
lodge
about
the
same
time
felix
morganson
did
no
trace
of
him
was
ever
how
long
after
the
disappearance
of
morganson
before
they
heard
from
him
about
a
month
later
then
a
hastily
scrawled
letter
came
from
a
little
town
in
canada
telling
his
aunt
that
he
was
well
and
not
to
worry
he
stated
that
he
did
not
have
time
to
write
any
more
at
the
moment
of
course
the
detectives
hustled
up
to
that
town
but
so
far
have
been
unable
to
learn
anything
or
to
uncover
a
single
he
has
been
missing
well
over
a
year
now
hasn
t
he
barry
mused
yes
because
thanksgiving
was
three
weeks
ago
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
vanished
the
queer
part
about
it
all
is
the
fact
that
no
request
for
a
ransom
was
ever
received
morganson
is
quite
wealthy
and
a
considerable
sum
could
be
raised
among
the
friends
of
felix
but
there
has
never
been
any
it
s
barry
slumped
lower
in
the
chair
his
mind
busy
with
the
details
of
the
event
but
how
about
this
haunting
that
you
spoke
of
that
came
later
didn
t
it
about
three
months
after
felix
morganson
disappeared
garrison
answered
besides
going
up
there
herself
once
in
a
while
morganson
also
rents
the
place
out
to
sportsmen
who
go
up
for
the
winter
season
to
hunt
and
to
those
that
go
there
in
the
summer
to
fish
well
late
in
january
a
group
of
sportsmen
went
there
and
the
understanding
was
that
they
would
stay
about
three
weeks
but
at
the
end
of
one
week
they
gave
it
up
and
took
a
smaller
place
down
at
the
tip
of
the
lake
they
complained
of
ghostly
rappings
or
knocks
on
the
door
and
no
one
there
when
they
opened
and
they
also
complained
that
some
of
their
things
had
been
sounds
foolish
barry
said
we
thought
it
was
at
first
you
see
i
handle
all
of
morganson
s
business
and
i
had
rented
the
place
to
these
men
who
came
from
connecticut
we
thought
for
a
while
that
they
were
just
cranky
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
two
weeks
later
another
party
went
in
and
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again
added
to
that
one
of
the
men
had
an
expensive
fur
coat
stolen
and
he
wanted
to
bring
suit
against
us
it
seems
that
they
heard
about
the
experience
of
the
former
party
and
claimed
that
we
had
rented
the
lodge
to
them
under
false
pretenses
we
had
some
trouble
getting
out
of
it
must
be
just
some
ordinary
thief
that
lives
in
the
woods
near
there
barry
ventured
if
so
he
goes
around
annoying
everybody
that
puts
up
in
the
lodge
later
in
the
year
some
fishermen
took
over
the
place
and
they
had
similar
experiences
and
besides
all
that
they
found
their
fishing
boat
scuttled
one
morning
three
holes
bored
in
it
fortunately
we
had
told
them
the
reputation
that
the
place
was
getting
but
they
had
just
laughed
at
it
they
came
away
mad
as
hornets
well
you
can
see
what
it
is
all
doing
no
one
will
rent
the
lodge
now
and
it
had
a
long
list
of
prospective
renters
once
the
value
of
it
keeps
going
down
and
since
we
can
not
rent
or
sell
it
at
a
decent
price
it
is
standing
does
morganson
want
to
sell
it
she
does
now
we
have
both
become
so
tired
of
the
place
and
its
problem
that
we
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
get
it
off
our
hands
there
is
only
one
buyer
at
present
a
man
named
brand
curry
but
he
wants
it
at
a
price
so
low
that
we
won
t
even
discuss
it
the
man
never
comes
to
me
he
always
goes
directly
to
but
look
here
dad
did
you
ever
have
a
detective
on
the
case
ever
have
any
one
go
up
there
oh
yes
i
have
had
two
private
investigators
spend
some
time
on
the
case
one
of
them
didn
t
find
anything
or
have
any
kind
of
an
experience
but
the
other
man
did
he
was
a
big
chunky
fellow
named
riley
and
he
said
he
could
catch
anything
he
went
after
said
he
would
come
home
dragging
the
ghost
or
spook
or
whatever
it
was
by
the
neck
he
remained
there
two
days
and
then
came
back
and
resigned
from
the
case
the
first
night
he
was
kept
busy
investigating
thumps
all
over
the
place
and
the
second
night
his
shoes
and
shirt
were
mysteriously
whisked
away
somehow
and
he
was
in
a
fix
because
he
hadn
t
taken
any
baggage
with
him
he
had
to
go
to
fox
point
and
outfit
himself
there
and
he
had
to
go
down
there
without
shirt
or
shoes
he
didn
t
hear
anything
that
night
and
all
the
time
he
was
there
he
didn
t
see
anything
he
was
a
disgusted
man
when
he
came
back
here
and
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
national
guard
should
be
ordered
up
barry
and
his
father
laughed
at
the
plight
of
the
private
detective
who
had
been
so
sure
of
victory
over
the
haunting
presence
at
bluff
lodge
but
of
course
dad
you
believe
that
someone
is
doing
all
this
for
a
purpose
i
can
t
see
any
other
explanation
his
father
confessed
but
i
can
t
figure
out
any
reason
for
it
why
should
anyone
want
to
frighten
camping
parties
that
way
and
who
is
clever
enough
to
make
raps
and
groans
and
knocks
and
yet
disappear
before
anyone
can
spot
him
that
lodge
stands
pretty
well
out
of
the
trees
and
no
one
could
dodge
behind
some
convenient
tree
trunk
after
every
one
of
these
meaningless
pranks
as
for
the
disappearance
of
riley
s
shirt
and
shoes
that
isn
t
so
much
of
a
mystery
after
all
the
window
was
open
in
his
room
and
anyone
could
have
fished
the
clothing
out
he
is
lucky
that
they
didn
t
steal
anything
more
and
put
him
in
a
bad
that
is
one
thing
that
convinces
me
that
the
spook
is
a
clever
one
barry
said
an
amateur
or
a
plain
fun
maker
would
have
stolen
all
of
his
things
this
one
took
just
enough
to
create
an
air
of
the
kindly
face
of
garrison
appeared
in
the
doorway
supper
is
ready
she
smiled
barry
and
his
father
walked
out
of
the
room
together
dad
said
barry
that
s
a
real
mystery
i
d
like
nothing
better
than
to
go
up
there
with
some
of
the
boys
and
nose
around
a
bit
maybe
we
could
find
out
his
father
smiled
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
aren
t
you
taking
that
title
of
mystery
hunter
a
little
seriously
barry
maybe
i
am
dad
but
you
never
can
tell
i
still
think
our
bunch
could
find
out
something
of
value
just
try
us
and
chapter
iii
planning
an
expedition
shortly
after
supper
barry
garrison
left
the
house
and
crossed
the
grass
in
the
direction
of
kent
s
home
but
he
was
saved
the
trouble
of
a
journey
to
his
chum
s
house
by
the
appearance
of
kent
himself
he
came
dashing
down
the
walk
and
joined
barry
going
for
a
walk
he
hailed
i
m
going
down
to
sadler
s
store
and
get
my
ice
skates
barry
replied
i
left
them
there
to
be
sharpened
thought
you
d
like
to
go
glad
to
nodded
kent
falling
into
step
beside
him
i
want
to
do
some
studying
a
little
later
and
after
the
supper
i
ate
i
felt
the
need
for
a
brisk
walk
i
was
going
to
drop
in
and
see
you
for
a
second
before
going
back
to
the
midnight
i
wanted
to
see
you
barry
informed
him
i
ve
got
quite
an
idea
in
my
head
for
our
winter
what
a
hunting
trip
yes
but
not
hunting
animals
hunting
spooks
what
kent
demanded
what
did
you
say
i
said
hunting
spooks
or
ghosts
or
haunts
or
something
think
we
could
take
a
photograph
of
a
rapping
spook
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
kent
growled
it
all
sounds
goofy
to
me
barry
laughed
it
did
to
me
when
my
father
was
telling
me
about
it
tune
in
to
the
proper
station
while
i
tell
you
something
about
i
m
tuned
in
kent
said
you
ll
have
to
make
it
a
good
one
or
it
will
all
be
static
let
s
hear
as
the
two
of
them
walked
slowly
toward
the
business
section
of
cloverfield
barry
related
the
story
which
he
had
heard
from
his
father
kent
s
light
and
scornful
attitude
vanished
as
he
listened
and
he
soon
became
as
deeply
interested
as
barry
had
been
their
steps
became
slower
and
they
no
longer
felt
the
coldness
of
the
night
air
they
had
arrived
outside
the
brightly
lighted
window
of
the
hardware
store
just
as
barry
finished
and
they
lingered
a
moment
to
discuss
it
that
s
a
mystery
kent
declared
i
d
like
to
go
up
there
and
snoop
around
that
s
just
what
i
had
in
mind
barry
told
him
i
talked
about
it
with
dad
at
the
supper
table
and
he
wasn
t
very
keen
about
it
at
first
but
finally
he
said
it
wouldn
t
hurt
anything
for
us
to
go
up
there
and
look
around
he
said
he
would
try
and
get
permission
for
us
to
camp
in
the
bronson
cabin
which
is
in
sight
of
the
lodge
how
does
that
strike
you
right
on
the
bull
answered
kent
promptly
we
can
hike
up
there
in
two
we
can
skate
up
there
in
less
time
than
that
barry
said
the
buffalo
river
runs
into
the
lake
about
two
miles
below
the
cabin
and
the
lodge
and
we
could
go
that
way
even
if
we
don
t
accomplish
a
thing
toward
solving
the
mystery
we
will
at
least
have
a
good
vacation
taking
in
a
skating
trip
and
camping
in
a
sure
thing
we
ve
never
camped
in
a
cabin
say
look
who
is
in
the
hardware
following
the
direction
of
kent
s
nod
barry
glanced
through
the
glass
and
his
eyes
rested
on
the
form
of
a
boy
about
their
own
age
who
was
examining
a
sleeping
bag
this
young
man
was
well
dressed
and
wore
an
expensive
fur
coat
on
a
counter
near
by
a
pile
of
camping
equipment
lay
spread
out
barry
recognized
the
boy
at
once
it
was
carter
wolf
the
one
who
had
been
detected
stealing
from
the
lockers
at
school
looks
like
wolf
is
going
somewhere
he
said
going
to
have
a
lot
of
duffle
with
him
too
added
kent
this
is
the
first
time
we
ve
seen
him
since
our
affair
of
the
locker
room
let
s
see
if
he
greets
us
with
they
entered
the
store
there
was
only
one
clerk
in
attendance
and
he
was
busy
with
carter
wolf
just
as
they
closed
the
door
they
heard
wolf
purchase
the
sleeping
bag
he
saw
the
boys
and
flushed
slightly
but
contented
himself
with
merely
turning
his
back
on
them
anything
else
wolf
the
clerk
asked
wolf
consulted
a
list
which
he
held
in
his
hand
just
one
thing
more
he
answered
i
want
a
the
clerk
quickly
procured
one
from
stock
you
re
buying
a
lot
of
stuff
wolf
he
smiled
must
be
going
on
a
camping
trip
wolf
raised
his
voice
slightly
i
am
a
bunch
of
us
are
going
up
to
camp
on
lake
barry
and
kent
exchanged
glances
and
then
looked
frankly
at
the
goods
which
wolf
had
purchased
they
were
expensive
things
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
rich
boy
was
planning
a
real
winter
camping
trip
fishing
tackle
and
an
ax
for
ice
fishing
an
old
stove
a
rifle
and
several
boxes
of
shotgun
shells
a
hunting
coat
and
cap
two
pairs
of
boots
the
sleeping
bags
for
two
other
members
of
his
party
and
a
handsome
hunting
knife
he
gave
directions
for
having
the
goods
sent
to
his
home
and
then
left
the
store
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
boys
wonder
whom
he
is
going
camping
with
kent
asked
as
they
waited
for
the
ice
skates
to
be
wrapped
up
he
goes
with
a
crowd
of
fellows
from
harrison
barry
said
probably
they
are
the
ones
who
will
go
he
evidently
intends
to
be
right
in
our
territory
so
we
ll
have
to
make
room
for
one
another
i
don
t
like
him
well
enough
to
want
to
be
very
near
him
or
his
i
don
t
either
kent
agreed
he
could
be
a
nice
fellow
if
he
tried
hard
but
it
is
easier
to
be
the
other
way
trouble
with
him
is
his
daddy
has
always
spoiled
him
well
we
ll
be
in
a
cabin
so
we
ll
probably
not
conflict
with
one
they
left
the
store
and
walked
toward
home
still
discussing
the
thing
nearest
their
minds
close
to
barry
s
house
they
met
the
twins
who
were
just
striding
along
under
a
lamplight
we
ll
have
some
news
for
them
that
will
open
their
eyes
kent
chuckled
the
twins
bore
down
on
them
here
you
are
mac
cried
tell
us
all
about
the
trip
to
arrowtip
lake
yes
chimed
in
tim
when
do
we
go
up
to
the
haunted
lodge
and
get
busy
chapter
iv
a
strange
conversation
barry
and
kent
surveyed
the
grinning
ford
boys
for
a
moment
in
silence
the
wind
taken
right
out
of
their
sails
as
kent
said
afterwards
then
barry
grunted
where
d
you
fellows
hear
about
that
lodge
he
demanded
that
won
t
be
much
trouble
to
answer
kent
declared
before
either
of
the
boys
could
speak
they
have
been
to
your
house
and
pearl
told
mac
whatever
you
tell
one
of
them
you
tell
the
mac
s
only
answer
to
the
charge
was
a
bland
grin
which
admitted
nothing
but
barry
knew
that
kent
was
right
his
sister
pearl
was
an
avowed
friend
of
mac
s
and
the
school
chatter
always
linked
their
names
together
i
might
have
known
it
barry
said
well
as
far
as
that
goes
it
wasn
t
any
secret
from
you
fellows
but
it
mustn
t
get
all
over
town
i
ll
warn
pearl
to
keep
it
quiet
i
suppose
you
ll
want
to
go
do
we
cried
tim
try
and
leave
us
home
what
do
you
think
about
skating
up
buffalo
river
to
the
lake
kent
asked
good
idea
mac
approved
there
are
a
couple
of
places
where
we
ll
have
to
leave
the
ice
and
i
know
that
barry
acknowledged
but
we
can
skate
most
of
the
way
how
much
of
the
story
did
pearl
tell
you
they
stood
under
the
street
light
in
a
group
and
the
ford
boys
told
what
they
had
learned
pearl
knew
most
of
the
events
that
had
taken
place
at
bluff
lodge
and
with
only
a
few
details
barry
completed
the
story
all
the
boys
were
now
more
eager
than
ever
before
to
go
let
s
keep
the
mystery
part
a
secret
kent
urged
we
ll
simply
give
out
the
information
that
we
are
going
on
a
camping
trip
that
is
partly
true
and
is
as
much
as
anyone
else
needs
to
do
you
think
we
ll
run
afoul
of
wolf
and
his
bunch
tim
asked
i
hardly
think
so
was
barry
s
reply
we
won
t
let
them
worry
us
if
we
do
see
them
well
i
want
to
get
on
home
and
do
a
little
studying
are
you
twins
through
with
yours
it
developed
that
the
twins
had
simply
gone
out
for
a
walk
after
their
evening
meal
and
had
dropped
in
first
at
kent
s
and
then
at
barry
s
home
it
was
the
custom
of
the
four
boys
to
stroll
some
after
supper
and
then
buckle
down
to
their
studies
they
all
made
fair
grades
in
school
and
kent
was
the
outstanding
one
among
them
are
you
fellows
going
to
win
that
soccer
game
against
berkley
kent
asked
the
fords
as
they
lingered
for
a
moment
in
front
of
barry
s
door
his
question
immediately
plunged
them
into
a
discussion
concerning
the
soccer
game
now
only
two
days
off
tim
and
mac
were
on
the
team
but
kent
and
barry
had
cast
in
their
lots
with
the
gymnasium
group
they
finally
separated
somewhat
reluctant
to
split
up
as
they
were
devoted
friends
and
the
study
table
was
less
to
be
desired
than
their
companionship
but
as
mac
expressed
it
all
good
things
have
to
come
to
an
end
even
a
plate
of
ice
cream
and
with
that
the
soccer
players
started
off
on
a
sprint
around
the
corner
while
barry
and
kent
went
to
their
front
doors
with
less
forceful
energy
two
days
later
cloverfield
went
to
berkley
to
play
soccer
the
team
had
gone
down
earlier
in
the
day
in
a
big
bus
and
the
rooters
followed
in
cars
and
on
the
train
barry
and
kent
decided
to
go
by
rail
as
it
was
a
short
trip
and
not
too
expensive
so
they
caught
the
proper
train
and
were
soon
in
the
small
town
and
on
their
way
to
the
athletic
field
the
game
was
a
stirring
one
and
the
two
boys
in
the
stand
were
gripped
by
it
the
two
teams
battled
up
and
down
the
field
fiercely
driving
the
ball
forward
and
being
hurled
back
it
became
so
exciting
that
barry
and
kent
left
the
stand
and
followed
the
teams
from
one
end
of
the
field
to
the
other
too
doggone
cold
to
sit
in
the
stand
today
anyway
barry
said
both
teams
were
battling
for
a
secure
position
in
the
school
conference
and
victory
today
meant
something
the
boys
who
had
run
out
on
the
field
in
the
short
trousers
and
thin
sleeveless
jerseys
were
now
warm
and
glowing
with
the
swift
running
and
kicking
and
blocking
it
seemed
as
though
it
must
end
in
a
scoreless
tie
mac
and
tim
had
been
battling
to
the
limit
tim
bore
down
on
a
berkley
kicker
and
leaped
into
the
air
blocking
the
sailing
ball
racing
around
the
almost
spent
player
tim
dashed
into
position
to
kick
the
ball
across
the
goal
line
but
the
safety
man
was
facing
him
ready
to
boot
the
football
far
down
the
field
and
out
of
danger
just
then
tim
saw
his
brother
cut
loose
and
leave
the
tangled
group
mac
s
voice
reached
him
in
husky
pleading
tim
kicked
the
ball
across
on
an
angle
and
mac
s
toe
met
it
with
a
mighty
boot
that
abruptly
changed
its
course
caught
off
guard
the
goal
tender
made
a
mad
dive
for
the
oncoming
ball
but
he
was
a
fraction
too
late
and
the
soccer
ball
flashed
across
for
the
first
goal
and
point
kent
and
barry
joined
enthusiastically
in
the
wild
cheer
that
went
up
from
cloverfield
rooters
in
the
next
six
minutes
that
remained
berkley
fought
fiercely
to
even
the
score
but
cloverfield
fought
as
grimly
to
turn
them
back
and
prevent
them
from
scoring
in
this
they
were
successful
and
the
game
ended
with
a
victory
in
favor
of
the
visiting
team
by
the
score
of
one
to
nothing
great
work
that
the
twins
did
approved
barry
as
they
followed
the
crowd
out
of
the
stand
section
you
re
right
nodded
kent
that
gives
us
the
edge
on
the
championship
we
ll
congratulate
the
boys
when
we
see
them
at
they
found
quite
a
crowd
assembled
at
the
station
and
their
train
was
not
due
for
some
time
there
was
a
holiday
spirit
among
the
people
and
the
station
was
decorated
with
wreaths
and
sprigs
of
christmas
greens
toys
and
candy
were
displayed
in
one
case
the
stoves
at
each
end
of
the
station
glowed
and
the
heat
felt
good
kent
and
barry
joined
a
group
of
home
school
boys
and
chatted
presently
barry
left
the
circle
and
walked
over
to
the
counter
to
buy
a
newspaper
obtaining
one
he
glanced
over
the
headlines
and
then
turned
to
the
sport
page
there
were
some
comments
on
games
and
players
and
he
sat
down
on
a
station
seat
to
read
on
the
other
side
two
men
were
seated
and
talking
but
barry
was
too
absorbed
even
to
glance
their
way
it
was
a
chance
phrase
that
caught
his
attention
anything
new
on
that
bluff
lodge
deal
a
voice
asked
the
voice
that
answered
was
coarse
and
husky
no
the
old
lady
don
t
want
to
accept
my
price
but
let
her
hold
out
if
she
wants
to
the
value
don
t
go
up
any
not
on
that
there
was
a
pause
barry
s
eyes
were
still
on
the
print
but
he
did
not
see
it
his
ears
were
listening
keenly
it
was
possible
that
they
were
talking
about
some
other
place
than
the
haunted
lodge
the
words
of
the
first
man
came
to
him
once
more
nobody
will
rent
the
place
she
ll
be
ready
to
give
it
away
before
at
that
moment
the
train
puffed
into
the
station
drowning
out
every
other
sound
barry
growled
inwardly
it
would
have
to
get
in
just
at
this
moment
folding
his
paper
he
stood
up
casually
and
looked
after
the
two
men
who
were
walking
out
to
board
the
train
one
was
tall
and
thin
and
the
other
was
short
and
chunky
he
was
unable
to
see
the
face
of
either
one
clearly
now
i
wonder
who
those
fellows
are
he
mused
no
doubt
dad
will
know
them
if
they
are
connected
in
any
way
with
bluff
lodge
and
from
the
way
they
talked
they
have
an
interest
in
that
chapter
v
the
start
upriver
a
few
days
after
the
victorious
soccer
game
with
berkley
the
high
school
closed
for
the
christmas
vacation
with
whoops
of
joy
the
boys
and
girls
poured
out
of
the
institution
of
learning
and
started
home
eager
for
the
holiday
and
all
the
good
things
connected
with
it
a
light
snow
had
fallen
the
night
before
and
the
country
was
clothed
with
a
blanket
of
white
tomorrow
night
tim
will
sit
up
and
try
to
see
what
santa
claus
looks
like
mac
grinned
as
the
four
boys
walked
down
the
main
street
he
always
does
until
pa
chases
him
to
bed
tim
cut
his
speech
short
by
neatly
planting
a
hastily
packed
snowball
back
of
mac
s
ear
his
brother
returned
the
fire
and
finally
kent
and
barry
joined
in
the
fun
becoming
fast
and
furious
a
group
across
the
street
began
to
bombard
them
and
then
the
four
chums
turned
on
the
common
enemy
in
this
manner
enjoying
the
sharp
air
and
the
fun
the
boys
came
to
barry
s
door
and
stopped
for
a
final
word
when
shall
we
get
started
tim
asked
i
think
we
ought
to
light
out
on
the
morning
after
christmas
barry
said
i
don
t
know
about
that
kent
objected
we
have
to
buy
some
provisions
and
pack
our
sled
and
we
won
t
want
to
do
that
on
christmas
let
s
make
it
two
days
after
the
great
the
others
agreed
to
this
as
far
as
i
can
see
nobody
knows
why
we
are
going
mac
said
no
i
think
everyone
believes
that
we
are
just
going
off
on
a
camping
trip
said
barry
that
is
what
we
want
them
to
think
after
all
we
may
not
learn
a
thing
about
the
mystery
and
in
that
case
our
trip
will
be
just
a
winter
but
we
ll
work
like
the
dickens
to
get
a
line
on
the
spook
promised
kent
as
they
parted
christmas
day
was
cold
and
gray
and
late
in
the
afternoon
it
began
to
snow
for
several
hours
the
light
flakes
fell
and
the
boys
were
beginning
to
worry
if
the
snow
became
too
deep
their
trip
would
have
to
be
put
off
and
it
looked
very
much
as
though
the
ice
on
the
river
would
be
covered
in
such
a
way
that
skating
would
be
impossible
but
the
day
following
the
holiday
a
wind
blew
the
snow
into
drifts
and
banks
and
kent
reported
that
the
river
was
clear
enough
to
skate
on
christmas
day
passed
off
quietly
and
the
boys
enjoyed
it
there
were
gifts
and
family
gatherings
and
a
cheery
air
in
general
the
next
day
they
busied
themselves
preparing
to
go
on
their
trip
in
kent
s
barn
there
was
a
wide
low
sled
and
they
began
to
pack
it
with
supplies
and
food
late
in
the
afternoon
they
stood
in
a
group
and
surveyed
it
guess
everything
is
on
there
barry
said
thoughtfully
i
can
t
think
of
anything
else
kent
admitted
who
is
going
to
pull
the
sled
at
the
start
tim
asked
roping
an
ax
down
firmly
kent
winked
at
barry
seems
like
you
twins
ought
to
pull
it
all
the
way
he
said
you
are
both
the
same
size
and
would
show
up
well
in
harness
we
wouldn
t
look
any
better
than
you
would
mac
retorted
let
s
flip
a
coin
to
see
who
pulls
several
tosses
of
the
coin
indicated
that
kent
was
to
pull
the
sled
first
and
the
twins
pounded
him
on
the
back
in
derision
darkness
was
now
falling
fast
and
they
separated
for
the
night
what
time
are
we
starting
tim
asked
we
ll
get
going
at
eight
o
clock
barry
decided
there
isn
t
any
great
hurry
we
ll
hunt
a
little
on
the
way
up
there
and
can
camp
out
tomorrow
to
the
four
boys
impatient
to
be
on
their
way
the
night
seemed
a
long
one
but
the
day
of
the
start
finally
came
and
they
were
ready
to
go
garrison
had
a
final
word
with
barry
here
are
the
keys
to
the
bronson
cabin
and
this
one
is
for
the
lodge
he
told
his
son
as
the
latter
laced
up
his
lumberman
shoes
you
can
look
around
all
you
want
to
but
keep
out
of
trouble
i
d
rather
that
you
would
not
camp
in
the
lodge
unless
there
seems
to
be
some
good
reason
for
doing
all
right
barry
agreed
but
it
will
be
permissible
to
look
through
the
place
won
t
it
dad
oh
surely
i
want
you
to
go
through
the
lodge
but
i
think
you
ll
be
more
comfortable
in
bronson
s
cabin
the
lodge
is
a
big
rambling
place
and
not
easy
to
heat
have
a
good
time
and
start
back
in
time
for
school
barry
promised
and
after
bidding
his
family
he
was
off
on
a
trot
across
the
intervening
yards
to
kent
s
barn
he
found
his
companions
there
tying
a
few
last
minute
articles
fast
they
greeted
him
joyously
we
were
just
going
over
to
ask
your
mother
if
you
were
up
yet
mac
hailed
she
would
have
told
you
that
i
ve
been
up
a
long
time
barry
smiled
kent
slung
his
skates
over
his
shoulder
i
guess
we
re
ready
to
go
he
said
who
d
we
decide
had
to
pull
the
sled
you
know
who
tim
answered
it
won
t
be
any
weight
to
pull
when
it
gets
on
the
the
mystery
hunters
set
off
for
the
buffalo
river
which
flowed
close
to
the
residential
section
of
cloverfield
it
was
a
clear
cold
day
and
their
spirits
rose
with
each
step
forward
the
sun
sparkled
on
the
snowbanks
and
the
icicles
until
all
the
landscape
flashed
with
beauty
all
four
of
them
rejoiced
to
be
alive
and
able
to
go
i
just
feel
like
i
could
strike
out
and
skate
for
hours
mac
said
it
s
a
dandy
day
for
a
snow
fight
like
we
had
at
the
high
school
last
year
kent
observed
in
fact
a
fellow
would
feel
like
doing
about
anything
on
a
day
like
except
being
at
home
with
the
mumps
or
something
tim
chuckled
there
is
the
old
river
barry
said
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
buffalo
now
we
can
get
into
real
they
sat
on
a
rotted
log
beside
the
river
and
put
on
their
skates
it
was
a
cold
job
and
more
than
once
they
paused
to
blow
on
chilled
fingers
but
at
last
the
skates
were
adjusted
and
the
campers
were
ready
to
swing
up
the
river
toward
lake
arrowtip
they
clumped
down
the
side
of
the
bank
and
slid
out
on
the
ice
cutting
a
few
circles
by
way
of
warming
up
kent
hooked
the
rope
of
the
sled
to
the
belt
of
his
mackinaw
i
guess
we
re
about
ready
he
nodded
and
with
a
ringing
sound
the
runners
of
the
skates
slid
forward
and
they
were
away
on
their
journey
upriver
for
over
a
mile
they
kept
up
a
fast
pace
and
then
moderated
it
somewhat
settling
down
to
an
even
gait
that
would
take
them
a
long
way
from
home
if
maintained
for
any
length
of
time
they
passed
a
few
skaters
and
one
group
of
high
school
boys
in
particular
with
whom
they
paused
to
chat
from
them
they
gleaned
the
information
that
carter
wolf
and
some
of
his
friends
had
started
on
their
trip
going
in
a
roundabout
way
by
motor
truck
they
ll
find
it
a
rough
journey
over
any
of
these
roads
to
lake
arrowtip
barry
commented
as
they
resumed
their
skating
i
d
rather
go
this
way
or
even
to
hike
it
kent
nodded
i
guess
wolf
would
rather
go
the
most
comfortable
way
mac
observed
i
ll
bet
the
truck
was
heated
in
some
way
i
m
even
surprised
that
wolf
will
go
camping
in
the
winter
leaving
cloverfield
far
behind
them
the
boys
followed
the
little
river
into
the
deep
woods
in
the
forest
the
stream
became
narrower
but
there
was
room
for
all
of
them
and
they
had
gone
seven
miles
before
it
became
necessary
to
leave
the
ice
sheet
and
take
to
the
shore
they
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
a
log
was
frozen
broadside
into
the
ice
and
a
mass
of
refuse
spoiled
the
smooth
glassy
surface
first
detour
sang
out
barry
what
do
you
say
we
hike
some
and
see
if
we
can
bring
down
a
rabbit
the
others
were
agreeable
and
they
took
to
the
shore
the
trees
were
sufficiently
far
back
from
the
banks
to
allow
them
to
proceed
pulling
the
sled
was
harder
and
barry
relieved
kent
of
it
they
tramped
along
and
just
before
noon
mac
took
a
shot
at
a
squirrel
but
missed
bum
shot
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
you
needn
t
lament
over
that
kent
consoled
it
would
be
quite
a
job
to
bring
that
lightning
dodger
down
with
a
at
noontime
they
halted
and
made
temporary
camp
the
twins
cut
into
the
wet
wood
and
hewed
to
the
center
for
the
dry
heart
of
it
the
other
two
boys
scraped
away
the
snow
and
piled
some
rocks
for
a
fireplace
after
some
fanning
and
blowing
the
damp
wood
caught
fire
and
blazed
up
kent
searched
among
the
articles
on
the
sled
and
then
straightened
up
say
look
here
did
anybody
think
to
bring
coffee
the
other
three
boys
looked
at
one
another
blankly
i
didn
t
barry
admitted
and
the
twins
admitted
the
same
we
can
live
without
it
mac
pointed
out
sure
we
can
but
you
know
how
good
it
tastes
on
a
camping
trip
especially
in
winter
we
haven
t
even
got
cocoa
along
and
i
was
sure
that
the
sled
was
fully
packed
is
there
any
place
that
we
can
get
it
along
the
line
we
could
swing
away
from
the
river
a
little
bit
and
get
it
at
fox
point
barry
said
we
ll
do
that
then
i
guess
we
can
go
without
it
for
a
few
days
come
on
and
get
your
plates
the
journey
was
resumed
immediately
after
dinner
and
they
skated
for
a
few
miles
then
some
rocks
made
it
necessary
for
them
to
go
around
and
they
walked
some
more
chancing
to
see
an
old
mill
on
a
branch
of
the
river
they
explored
it
and
before
long
nightfall
was
upon
them
and
they
stopped
to
make
an
overnight
camp
two
small
camping
tents
were
set
up
and
sleeping
bags
spread
out
then
they
made
a
fireplace
and
gathered
a
supply
of
wood
by
the
time
that
the
fire
was
going
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
flames
flashed
up
into
the
inky
blackness
like
living
tongues
throwing
the
black
tree
trunks
into
bold
relief
against
the
white
background
of
the
earth
fellows
this
is
just
right
tim
exclaimed
looking
around
him
with
delight
barry
and
kent
were
bent
over
the
fire
and
mac
was
coming
in
with
a
load
of
wood
on
his
shoulder
it
s
colder
camping
than
we
are
used
to
kent
remarked
mac
threw
his
load
of
wood
on
the
ground
boys
we
may
be
able
to
get
some
coffee
he
said
there
is
another
campfire
just
a
short
distance
over
the
others
looked
up
with
interest
where
barry
and
kent
asked
in
chorus
mac
pointed
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
brought
the
wood
just
a
little
way
over
there
i
was
chopping
wood
on
the
top
of
a
knoll
and
i
could
see
their
fire
through
the
we
could
go
over
there
and
borrow
some
coffee
tim
said
it
would
be
nice
to
know
who
our
neighbors
are
barry
commented
unless
said
kent
slowly
those
neighbors
happen
to
be
carter
wolf
and
his
particular
friends
if
so
the
less
they
know
about
our
whereabouts
the
better
for
chapter
vi
strange
treatment
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
after
kent
had
spoken
the
boys
were
not
afraid
of
the
wolf
boy
and
his
companions
but
they
had
no
desire
to
camp
too
close
to
them
carter
possessed
a
mean
spirit
and
they
felt
it
best
to
avoid
him
wherever
possible
i
hardly
believe
that
they
will
camp
out
in
the
woods
tim
said
i
ll
bet
they
will
go
to
a
cabin
or
some
more
comfortable
place
if
it
is
wolf
he
won
t
give
us
any
or
sell
us
any
either
mac
added
we
wouldn
t
need
to
walk
right
into
that
other
camp
barry
advised
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
approach
the
place
without
making
any
noise
i
think
we
should
find
out
who
is
camping
tim
and
i
will
go
over
and
scout
around
mac
offered
all
right
barry
nodded
we
ll
get
supper
ready
if
anything
goes
wrong
just
sing
out
and
we
ll
come
hopping
nothing
will
happen
if
we
get
running
first
tim
grinned
shall
we
offer
to
pay
for
the
coffee
sure
nodded
kent
they
may
have
a
small
supply
and
we
wouldn
t
want
to
take
it
away
from
them
if
they
give
it
to
you
that
will
be
all
right
but
we
should
offer
to
buy
tim
pushed
his
camping
ax
down
into
his
belt
case
come
on
mac
let
s
see
where
you
spotted
that
leaving
barry
and
kent
at
the
campfire
the
two
brothers
hiked
off
into
the
woods
to
the
knoll
where
mac
had
been
cutting
wood
it
was
an
uphill
climb
and
their
breath
showed
in
little
frosty
clouds
before
they
got
to
the
place
finally
mac
pointed
off
through
the
spruce
trees
there
it
is
see
that
fire
down
there
following
the
direction
of
mac
s
mittened
finger
tim
saw
a
small
point
of
light
down
in
a
hollow
it
came
evidently
from
a
small
fire
and
appeared
to
be
less
than
a
away
they
were
unable
to
see
anything
else
except
the
little
flame
somebody
down
there
all
right
tim
nodded
well
let
s
go
and
we
ll
look
before
we
knock
mac
chuckled
it
might
be
the
wrong
house
they
descended
the
other
side
of
the
knoll
and
tramped
on
toward
the
lone
campfire
underfoot
the
snow
crunched
and
broke
with
a
cold
snapping
sound
and
the
rocks
were
slippery
the
stars
stood
out
brilliantly
overhead
and
they
had
no
difficulty
in
making
their
way
through
the
vermont
forest
they
rounded
a
ragged
bluff
of
rock
and
the
fire
was
now
very
near
slow
up
now
and
let
s
get
a
good
look
at
this
outfit
mac
whispered
tim
nodded
silently
and
they
began
to
approach
the
camp
as
noiselessly
as
possible
keeping
behind
friendly
trees
they
slipped
closer
and
closer
until
they
could
see
around
the
clear
space
in
the
center
of
which
a
small
fire
burned
fitfully
it
isn
t
wolf
and
his
bunch
mac
whispered
no
only
a
man
and
a
woman
tim
returned
in
an
equally
low
tone
the
camp
was
occupied
by
a
man
and
a
woman
close
beside
the
fire
could
be
seen
some
camping
equipment
a
frying
pan
which
had
apparently
been
placed
in
the
snow
while
hot
a
knapsack
and
a
brightly
colored
blanket
and
a
pair
of
gloves
against
a
stump
leaned
a
rifle
and
the
man
had
a
hunting
knife
at
his
belt
they
had
just
finished
supper
and
the
smell
of
fish
lingered
on
the
air
the
woman
was
placing
chunks
of
snow
in
a
pan
and
when
this
was
finished
she
put
the
pan
on
the
fire
there
was
a
sizzling
sound
as
the
snow
on
the
outside
of
the
pot
slid
into
the
fire
before
advancing
any
further
the
boys
studied
the
man
and
woman
closely
they
were
and
looked
to
be
french
both
of
them
were
warmly
dressed
for
winter
travel
and
their
camping
equipment
was
battered
and
blackened
indicating
much
use
the
woman
wore
a
coat
with
a
rich
fur
collar
and
both
of
them
seemed
perfectly
at
home
in
the
woods
they
exchanged
no
words
and
were
engrossed
in
their
tasks
the
man
was
cleaning
scraps
from
a
plate
while
the
woman
waited
for
the
snow
to
melt
tim
reached
over
and
pushed
mac
might
as
well
go
to
it
he
said
and
the
brothers
left
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
approached
the
camp
they
had
advanced
several
steps
before
the
campers
heard
them
coming
they
had
left
the
trees
and
were
crossing
the
clearing
the
woman
was
the
first
to
hear
them
and
she
lifted
her
head
with
a
swift
motion
and
her
black
eyes
seemed
to
glitter
like
those
of
an
animal
who
was
trapped
she
spoke
sharply
in
french
to
her
companion
who
dropped
a
plate
and
rose
to
his
feet
his
hand
running
backward
toward
his
hunting
knife
the
woman
looked
around
at
the
rifle
hi
greeted
mac
not
very
well
impressed
with
the
manner
of
the
two
campers
may
we
come
into
your
camp
look
like
you
in
ze
camp
now
said
the
man
without
a
smile
what
you
want
we
re
camping
just
over
the
hill
mac
explained
his
eyes
on
the
woman
who
had
picked
up
the
rifle
she
was
holding
it
muzzle
down
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
but
her
eyes
stared
at
them
in
a
way
that
neither
of
the
boys
relished
we
found
that
we
had
forgotten
to
bring
any
coffee
with
us
so
we
saw
your
fire
and
came
to
ask
if
you
could
sell
us
sorry
if
we
startled
you
tim
added
what
you
want
the
man
asked
again
the
boys
looked
at
him
with
some
astonishment
i
just
told
you
mac
answered
we
came
to
buy
some
you
not
come
to
buy
coffee
the
man
said
his
chin
coming
forward
in
a
way
that
was
far
from
comforting
you
want
somet
ing
else
eh
you
follow
us
eh
we
did
not
tim
denied
indignantly
we
re
camping
up
here
and
we
saw
your
fire
that
is
the
woman
spoke
to
her
companion
pierre
listen
she
launched
into
rapid
french
and
when
she
had
finished
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
turned
to
the
boys
suddenly
we
not
got
coffee
we
not
got
anyt
ing
you
go
back
to
your
camp
go
back
she
made
a
quick
motion
with
the
rifle
though
she
did
not
lift
the
muzzle
which
still
pointed
downward
there
was
no
mistaking
the
implied
threat
or
the
fact
that
the
boys
were
not
wanted
mac
felt
angry
at
their
unfriendly
reception
but
he
felt
it
best
to
retreat
at
once
all
right
he
said
we
only
wanted
to
buy
a
little
coffee
we
weren
t
going
to
ask
you
to
give
it
to
us
come
along
we
got
no
coffee
we
got
not
ing
the
woman
repeated
and
the
twins
turned
and
walked
off
their
eyes
on
the
alert
for
any
sudden
move
but
the
woodsman
and
his
wife
stood
by
the
flickering
fire
motionless
no
word
was
spoken
until
they
were
around
the
rock
bluff
and
then
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
what
do
you
make
of
that
tim
asked
well
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
know
mac
cried
wasn
t
that
the
limit
they
acted
as
if
we
were
a
couple
of
that
s
probably
what
they
are
tim
advanced
mac
came
to
a
halt
why
of
course
he
said
something
about
following
them
i
ll
bet
those
two
are
a
couple
of
bad
eggs
maybe
we
re
lucky
we
got
away
from
tim
urged
him
on
let
s
get
back
to
the
camp
he
said
looking
over
his
shoulder
see
what
the
other
boys
think
about
when
they
stalked
into
camp
a
delightful
smell
of
pork
and
beans
greeted
them
kent
was
piling
fresh
wood
on
the
fire
and
barry
was
stirring
a
fork
around
among
the
beans
the
sled
had
been
cleaned
off
and
was
ready
to
serve
as
a
table
hello
what
luck
barry
hailed
get
any
coffee
all
we
got
was
an
order
to
get
out
of
the
camp
pronto
mac
answered
almost
got
ordered
off
with
a
rifle
tim
added
stooping
down
and
warming
his
hands
over
the
cook
fire
what
s
that
barry
asked
sharply
was
it
wolf
s
camp
kent
inquired
no
it
wasn
t
this
is
what
mac
related
the
story
and
the
other
two
boys
listened
with
interest
and
astonishment
well
you
certainly
got
a
cool
reception
was
kent
s
comment
cool
exploded
tim
it
almost
froze
us
barry
gazed
off
in
the
timber
in
the
direction
of
the
hostile
camp
that
s
a
mighty
queer
way
for
anyone
to
act
when
you
just
go
and
ask
them
to
sell
you
yes
and
they
had
coffee
too
mac
avowed
i
saw
the
jar
of
it
did
you
tim
his
brother
nodded
as
plain
as
day
right
there
beside
the
fire
but
they
acted
as
though
we
were
they
were
still
discussing
it
when
they
sat
down
to
eat
and
it
furnished
the
main
topic
until
bedtime
gradually
they
drifted
to
other
things
and
forgot
the
incident
they
did
not
stay
up
long
after
supper
the
cold
was
severe
and
did
not
encourage
sitting
around
for
more
than
an
hour
after
the
meal
after
cutting
a
big
supply
of
firewood
they
decided
to
turn
in
the
good
old
sleeping
bags
will
serve
us
well
tonight
kent
said
as
they
prepared
to
turn
in
barry
brought
a
pan
of
melted
snow
from
the
fire
here
is
warm
water
to
wash
in
he
announced
hurry
up
and
get
at
it
or
it
will
tim
was
the
first
one
to
wash
and
he
toweled
his
face
and
neck
with
chattering
teeth
good
night
but
this
is
cold
business
he
ejaculated
too
icy
to
wash
behind
the
ears
mac
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
shirt
and
sat
on
the
sleeping
bag
while
he
washed
then
with
a
yell
he
slipped
inside
the
warm
lining
of
the
bag
doubling
up
boy
doesn
t
this
feel
good
it
did
not
take
the
others
long
to
get
into
their
bags
barry
and
kent
shared
one
tent
and
the
twins
had
the
other
after
a
few
words
they
went
to
sleep
and
utter
stillness
settled
over
the
winter
camp
several
hours
later
barry
awoke
and
crawled
out
of
the
bag
shivering
in
the
cold
air
the
fire
was
low
and
he
wanted
to
keep
it
going
so
that
they
could
make
a
quick
blaze
in
the
morning
he
pulled
on
his
shoes
and
slipped
into
his
mackinaw
his
hat
followed
and
then
he
stepped
up
and
out
of
the
tent
rubbing
his
hands
he
halted
with
a
little
shock
a
short
man
in
corduroy
trousers
and
woodsman
s
boots
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
looking
around
the
camp
at
sight
of
barry
he
crouched
and
fairly
sprang
into
the
bushes
beating
a
retreat
from
the
place
his
form
had
been
shadowy
and
indistinct
barry
roused
from
his
state
of
surprise
here
he
called
out
sharply
what
do
you
want
who
are
you
there
was
no
answer
from
the
one
who
had
been
watching
the
camp
all
was
profoundly
silent
chapter
vii
at
bronson
s
cabin
kent
stirred
and
sat
up
in
his
sleeping
bag
in
the
dimness
of
the
tent
he
saw
that
barry
was
not
there
he
heard
the
twins
move
and
say
something
in
the
next
tent
then
kent
seemed
to
remember
that
someone
had
spoken
where
are
you
barry
out
here
came
the
answer
somebody
has
been
in
the
kent
and
the
twins
joined
him
as
soon
as
possible
barry
was
heaping
more
wood
on
the
fire
you
say
somebody
was
in
the
camp
kent
asked
barry
pointed
to
the
spot
where
the
man
had
stood
a
man
was
standing
there
when
i
just
came
out
to
put
more
wood
on
the
fire
i
couldn
t
make
his
face
out
very
well
but
he
was
a
short
stocky
fellow
and
i
just
took
it
that
he
was
the
frenchman
you
boys
i
ll
bet
it
was
tim
answered
any
of
our
things
missing
barry
shook
his
head
i
believe
least
i
can
t
see
that
anything
is
it
looked
to
me
as
if
he
had
just
arrived
what
time
is
it
anyway
mac
tugged
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
at
the
dial
by
the
light
of
the
fire
ten
minutes
past
three
he
announced
i
suppose
they
have
broken
camp
and
are
on
their
way
said
tim
they
may
have
just
stopped
by
to
take
a
look
at
us
you
didn
t
see
the
woman
no
and
i
can
t
even
be
sure
that
the
man
was
that
frenchman
did
he
have
on
brown
corduroy
pants
and
a
checked
mackinaw
yes
the
twins
nodded
then
that
s
who
it
was
i
could
see
that
much
by
the
feeble
light
of
the
fire
though
i
couldn
t
see
his
face
think
we
ought
to
go
back
to
bed
i
m
too
sleepy
to
sit
up
for
any
frenchman
kent
yawned
i
don
t
believe
that
he
ll
come
back
mac
said
i
m
freezing
around
here
so
i
m
on
my
way
back
to
the
bed
call
me
for
breakfast
call
you
nothing
cried
kent
barry
and
i
cooked
supper
so
you
fellows
are
billed
to
provide
the
the
others
went
back
to
their
sleeping
bags
and
barry
built
the
fire
up
before
seeking
his
when
he
did
crawl
back
into
the
soft
warm
interior
of
the
bag
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
at
once
for
a
long
time
he
lay
listening
but
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
and
at
last
he
dozed
off
and
slept
soundly
he
was
awakened
by
kent
stirring
around
and
crawling
over
him
let
s
go
see
what
these
twins
have
for
us
his
companion
invited
and
barry
followed
as
quickly
as
he
could
get
dressed
the
ford
brothers
were
already
on
the
job
and
bacon
was
curling
in
the
pan
the
day
was
gray
and
overcast
and
it
looked
as
though
it
might
snow
i
guess
our
french
friend
didn
t
come
back
mac
said
forking
out
bacon
on
the
tin
plates
everything
is
about
ready
to
eat
come
and
get
breakfast
was
soon
dispatched
and
then
they
put
the
camp
in
order
before
long
they
were
on
the
river
again
skating
along
rapidly
in
order
to
warm
up
they
had
gone
scarcely
a
mile
when
bodies
were
warm
and
blood
tingling
i
hope
it
doesn
t
snow
until
we
get
to
the
cabin
kent
said
so
do
i
barry
agreed
a
big
fall
would
work
against
they
had
planned
to
eat
one
more
outdoor
meal
but
they
arrived
close
to
fox
point
around
the
noon
hour
so
they
had
dinner
in
the
country
store
there
eating
sandwiches
and
drinking
hot
cocoa
at
a
little
table
close
to
the
round
iron
stove
that
threw
out
a
splendid
heat
they
bought
the
coffee
that
they
lacked
and
then
started
once
more
at
last
they
skated
out
on
the
broad
expanse
of
ice
that
marked
lake
arrowtip
here
we
are
at
last
mac
whooped
let
s
have
a
race
down
the
lake
to
the
you
can

do
it
barry
objected
see
how
that
snow
is
spread
out
you
go
a
little
way
and
then
you
have
to
walk
across
a
snow
bar
and
strike
the
ice
on
the
other
side
you
just
can
t
keep
that
s
all
the
better

it
will

the
snow
and

reminded
them
but
you
fellows
go
to
it
and
i
ll
follow
on
are
you
ready
get
set
go
the
three
racers
were
off
like
a
shot
striking
out
across
the
clear
ice
of
lake
arrowtip
coming
to
the
soft
snow
that
spread
across
their
path
they
leaped
into
it
and
ran
through
as
fast
as
their
skates
would
allow
them
to
again
they
were
out
on
clear
ice
and
for
a
time
they
skated
furiously
with
mac
slightly
in
the
lead
then
another
and
longer
island
of
snow
slowed
them
down
and
tim
tipped
over
tumbling
in
the
path
of
kent
who
had
to
swerve
to
avoid
going
down
by
the
time
that
kent
got
on
the
ice
again
mac
was
far
ahead
and
turned
around
in
a
swift
circle
and
gave
the
race
up
waiting
for
the
others
to
catch
up
with
him
barry
skated
on
in
a
more
leisurely
manner
drawing
the
sled
after
him
and
taking
in
the
beauty
of
lake
arrowtip
he
had
visited
the
place
in
the
spring
and
summer
but
had
never
seen
it
in
the
grip
of
the
new
england
winter
it
presented
now
the
picture
of
a
broad
flooring
of
ice
with
the
dark
lines
of
pine
and
hemlock
ringing
it
around
from
the
lake
the
hills
ran
up
sharply
flowing
into
the
mountains
blanketed
with
a
thick
white
carpet
of
snow
out
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
stood
rake
island
a
rugged
little
thumb
of
land
covered
with
brush
and
timber
and
rough
rocks
behind
them
the
lake
was
broad
but
before
them
it
narrowed
barry
could
now
see
the
bronson
cabin
and
beyond
it
the
roof
of
the
lodge
his
heart
beat
faster
and
unconsciously
he
skated
on
with
increased
speed
they
were
close
to
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
events
that
had
interested
him
so
much
he
joined
the
others
and
they
were
soon
at
the
bank
before
the
bronson
cabin
taking
off
their
skates
they
walked
up
the
slope
to
this
plain
little
log
house
but
their
eyes
were
on
the
big
hunting
lodge
it
stood
on
a
bluff
and
could
be
approached
only
in
a
roundabout
way
from
the
lake
up
the
sides
of
the
slopes
and
not
from
the
front
there
it
is
the
house
of
mystery
cried
tim
as
they
took
in
the
length
of
the
low
log
lodge
building
it
looks
cold
and
deserted
mac
offered
doesn
t
look
as
though
it
has
any
spooks
around
it
at
this
time
of
year
bet
you
a
doughnut
we
don
t
learn
a
that
s
a
mighty
poor
spirit
to
start
our
hunt
with
barry
objected
as
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
key
to
the
bronson
cabin
up
to
the
moment
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
cabin
in
which
they
were
going
to
live
but
now
as
barry
unlocked
the
door
they
scanned
it
with
interest
it
was
nearly
square
and
was
made
of
rough
hewed
logs
it
appeared
to
be
very
old
and
there
was
only
one
small
window
to
the
left
of
the
door
a
rock
chimney
pushed
its
way
through
the
roof
we
ll
like
this
place
when
we
get
used
to
it
kent
predicted
barry
pushed
the
door
open
and
they
entered
there
was
a
large
general
room
and
a
small
which
served
as
a
kitchen
a
single
bed
with
sooty
covers
was
pushed
up
against
the
wall
on
one
side
of
the
room
a
wide
fireplace
with
rusty
andirons
in
it
showed
at
the
back
of
the
cabin
room
everything
was
dirty
and
hasn
t
been
used
for
some
time
tim
commented
as
they
stood
and
looked
around
no
barry
admitted
dad
said
it
hadn
t
we
ll
have
a
lot
of
cleaning
and
fixing
to
do
also
we
ll
have
to
sleep
on
the
floor
in
our
sleeping
bags
as
there
is
only
one
bed
in
the
place
and
it
doesn
t
look
very
inviting
well
how
about
it
shall
we
go
to
work
the
others
were
entirely
agreeable
and
they
set
to
with
a
will
there
was
an
abundance
of
work
for
everyone
and
so
the
afternoon
hours
sped
away
just
before
dark
they
united
their
efforts
and
cut
enough
wood
for
the
winter
evening
it
was
dark
when
they
had
gathered
enough
and
then
they
turned
their
attention
to
supper
there
was
a
rusty
iron
stove
in
the
and
between
that
and
the
open
fireplace
they
managed
without
any
trouble
supper
was
a
happy
affair
and
when
the
wind
rose
a
little
later
they
congratulated
themselves
that
they
had
a
warm
cabin
to
camp
in
and
it
looks
a
heap
cleaner
than
it
did
when
we
came
here
mac
remarked
looking
around
with
satisfaction
they
spent
the
long
evening
chatting
around
the
fireplace
and
at
last
sought
their
sleeping
bags
on
the
log
floor
before
the
fire
barry
opened
the
door
to
throw
out
some
wash
water
and
stood
for
a
moment
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
darker
mass
of
the
lodge
building
tomorrow
we
ll
look
into
that
place
he
reflected
i
wonder
what
the
secret
of
it
is
anyway
well
i
hope
we
ll
be
lucky
enough
to
find
out
maybe
the
haunt
will
be
around
tonight
to
look
us
over
chapter
viii
the
upstairs
window
the
boys
slept
soundly
throughout
the
night
and
it
was
seven
o
clock
before
tim
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
the
unfamiliar
interior
of
the
bronson
cabin
for
a
moment
he
was
unable
to
place
himself
and
then
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
came
to
him
a
glance
at
his
companions
showed
that
they
were
still
asleep
the
fire
had
long
since
gone
out
and
the
place
was
cold
he
struggled
up
into
a
sitting
position
it
certainly
is
cold
in
here
he
decided
slipping
out
of
the
warm
bag
i
ll
get
our
fire
going
at
once
and
believe
me
i
want
a
more
comfortable
bed
than
that
one
was
he
shivered
while
pulling
on
his
clothes
and
it
was
with
satisfaction
that
he
drew
his
heavy
sweater
down
over
his
head
then
he
looked
around
for
water
in
which
to
wash
but
the
little
that
they
had
was
frozen
no
bath
until
after
i
get
the
fire
under
way
and
melt
some
snow
he
thought
i
ll
probably
need
a
wash
worse
after
building
the
fire
than
i
do
now
kent
woke
up
and
looked
at
him
sleepily
hello
you
re
an
early
bird
i
see
yes
i
am
tim
retorted
reaching
for
his
ax
i
m
going
out
and
gather
worms
for
the
rest
of
you
lazy
birds
fine
kent
approved
hurry
up
and
get
a
fire
going
so
that
i
can
get
up
anyone
who
isn
t
up
by
the
time
i
come
back
with
wood
will
get
a
snow
rub
promised
the
ford
twin
all
of
the
wood
had
been
used
up
on
the
previous
night
and
tim
was
compelled
to
go
out
and
hunt
for
a
fresh
supply
accordingly
he
stepped
out
onto
the
snow
before
the
cabin
his
eyes
quickly
taking
in
the
lake
and
the
surrounding
country
for
a
moment
he
paused
taking
in
the
beauty
of
it
all
unconsciously
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
tops
of
the
spruce
and
hemlocks
and
striking
fire
on
the
sheet
of
ice
icicles
gleamed
from
the
roof
slope
of
the
big
hunting
lodge
at
the
edge
of
the
timber
a
rabbit
hopped
out
into
the
clearing
looked
around
with
a
jerk
of
his
brown
head
and
then
streaked
off
into
the
undergrowth
by
ginger
it
s
a
dandy
morning
and
those
sleepyheads
in
there
tim
knew
that
it
was
warm
and
comfortable
in
the
sleeping
bags
but
the
beauty
of
the
new
morning
was
worth
looking
at
he
started
off
toward
the
timber
to
get
his
supply
of
wood
and
then
noticed
a
small
shack
close
to
the
cabin
investigating
this
he
was
delighted
to
find
a
small
stack
of
firewood
good
luck
this
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
cutting
a
supply
right
he
slipped
the
camping
ax
through
his
belt
and
carried
a
heaping
armful
of
wood
into
the
cabin
by
this
time
all
of
the
boys
were
awake
kent
was
dressing
and
mac
and
barry
still
enjoyed
the
comfort
of
the
bags
i
m
glad
to
see
that
you
fellows
have
decided
to
get
up
at
last
tim
greeted
them
we
were
afraid
to
face
your
wrath
if
we
didn
t
kent
smiled
you
got
that
wood
in
a
mighty
big
yes
it
was
found
a
small
supply
of
it
in
a
shack
around
on
the
other
side
of
the
tim
heaped
it
into
the
fireplace
and
touched
a
match
to
the
kindling
the
boys
watched
the
flame
lick
upward
and
then
spread
with
a
crackling
sound
to
the
remainder
of
the
wood
that
feels
good
barry
approved
getting
up
the
whole
outfit
thanks
you
timmy
boy
you
can
express
your
gratitude
in
a
more
lasting
and
practical
way
tim
informed
him
now
that
i
have
built
the
fire
suppose
you
fellows
make
the
we
ll
agree
to
that
kent
said
barry
began
to
open
the
package
of
bacon
tim
as
long
as
you
are
dressed
for
the
great
suppose
you
go
get
that
long
extension
handle
for
the
coffee
pot
from
the
all
right
where
s
the
sled
right
outside
the
door
barry
told
him
i
don
t
remember
seeing
it
there
but
i
suppose
it
is
answered
tim
as
he
made
for
the
door
mac
rolled
up
the
sleeping
bags
and
put
them
away
do
we
have
to
sleep
this
way
every
night
he
asked
no
we
ve
got
to
work
out
some
plan
for
better
beds
barry
replied
this
floor
is
hard
and
tim
thrust
his
head
in
the
doorway
say
that
sled
isn
t
here
he
called
isn
t
there
kent
demanded
no
sir
it
is
not
we
left
it
right
here
by
the
door
didn
t
we
barry
hastened
to
the
door
followed
by
the
other
boys
yes
we
left
it
there
with
the
long
handle
and
a
roll
of
canvas
on
top
of
he
looked
around
the
ground
and
off
toward
the
timber
it
is
gone
all
right
i
d
like
to
know
who
took
unmindful
of
the
cold
they
were
all
outside
standing
in
a
group
around
the
spot
where
the
sled
had
been
left
the
night
before
the
snow
was
too
solidly
packed
to
reveal
any
marks
of
the
runners
well
that
means
that
somebody
was
around
here
last
night
while
we
were
all
sleeping
barry
remarked
when
i
threw
some
water
out
before
i
went
to
bed
i
saw
the
front
runner
so
the
sled
was
here
at
that
time
anybody
hear
anything
no
one
had
as
if
by
common
consent
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
bluff
lodge
standing
solidly
in
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
when
are
we
going
to
look
through
that
place
mac
asked
sometime
today
barry
promised
but
first
we
want
to
see
if
we
can
get
our
sled
he
studied
the
ground
around
the
front
of
the
cabin
not
a
look
here
cried
tim
who
had
been
doing
some
hunting
on
his
own
account
somebody
looked
in
the
window
at
us
last
night
he
pointed
to
a
row
of
fingerprints
on
the
ledge
of
the
window
and
the
boys
crowded
around
in
excitement
there
were
ten
fingermarks
in
the
snow
that
clung
to
the
outside
sill
i
wonder
if
those
prints
were
there
before
we
came
mac
mused
that
snow
is
they
have
been
made
by
somebody
who
leaned
down
hard
kent
decided
studying
the
marks
you
can
see
where
the
snow
broke
under
his
fingers
i
didn
t
look
at
this
window
ledge
before
so
i
don
t
know
whether
they
were
here
before
or
none
of
the
boys
had
noticed
the
marks
but
all
of
them
were
inclined
to
believe
that
whoever
had
stolen
the
sled
had
peered
in
the
window
and
had
made
the
prints
they
were
gripped
with
a
feeling
of
mystery
things
are
starting
pretty
quickly
barry
said
somewhat
grimly
mac
glanced
inside
the
cabin
door
and
then
sprinted
forward
with
a
shout
hey
the
coffee
is
boiling
all
over
the
place
the
accident
to
the
beverage
was
more
of
a
benefit
than
an
evil
because
the
boys
had
been
standing
in
the
cold
air
long
enough
to
feel
somewhat
chilled
at
mac
s
frantic
whoop
they
crowded
back
into
the
building
and
kent
rescued
the
blackened
pot
scorching
his
hands
in
the
act
they
lost
no
time
now
in
dispatching
breakfast
and
during
the
meal
they
discussed
the
trend
of
events
the
fact
that
someone
had
been
close
to
them
during
the
night
put
them
on
their
guard
and
they
determined
to
make
a
search
for
the
missing
sled
at
once
we
need
that
sled
tim
declared
when
we
go
back
to
town
we
don
t
want
to
have
to
pack
all
the
stuff
on
our
we
can
do
it
if
we
have
to
barry
reminded
him
of
course
but
who
wants
to
i
m
wondering
if
the
one
or
ones
who
took
it
did
it
for
a
joke
or
because
they
needed
might
have
been
some
of
wolf
s
crowd
mac
suggested
we
don
t
even
know
if
they
are
anywhere
near
us
kent
protested
if
they
are
i
wouldn
t
put
it
past
them
mac
went
on
they
hastily
cleaned
the
dishes
and
then
left
the
cabin
locking
the
door
after
them
another
attempt
was
made
to
pick
up
the
trail
but
there
simply
was
no
track
to
follow
nothing
doing
we
ll
just
have
to
hike
along
and
see
what
we
can
see
barry
decided
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
spent
in
a
fruitless
tramp
through
the
woods
they
entered
the
timber
back
of
the
cabin
and
made
a
big
circle
around
to
the
east
going
along
for
several
miles
until
they
came
out
on
the
ice
of
the
lake
during
this
time
they
passed
only
one
home
where
they
talked
for
a
moment
with
some
poor
children
who
were
the
only
ones
home
at
the
time
in
all
respects
it
was
a
deserted
mountain
country
they
got
back
to
the
cabin
at
noontime
and
dragged
a
dead
limb
up
before
the
door
planning
to
chop
some
firewood
a
little
later
dinner
consisted
of
a
large
rabbit
that
mac
had
shot
on
the
morning
trip
and
after
the
meal
was
over
the
mystery
hunters
went
to
work
the
twins
and
kent
began
to
wash
the
dishes
and
barry
went
out
to
chop
the
tree
that
they
had
dragged
in
the
plan
for
the
afternoon
was
to
make
another
search
for
the
sled
this
time
on
the
other
side
of
the
hunting
lodge
the
country
in
this
direction
was
much
wilder
than
that
on
the
side
where
the
bronson
cabin
stood
and
just
beyond
bluff
lodge
they
could
see
the
ragged
side
of
an
old
granite
quarry
it
was
also
part
of
the
afternoon
program
to
explore
the
lodge
barry
worked
on
the
limb
with
a
sharp
ax
and
soon
the
pile
of
stovewood
mounted
beside
him
after
a
time
he
paused
to
rest
leaning
on
the
handle
of
the
ax
the
vigorous
exercise
had
made
him
feel
warm
his
eyes
traveled
over
to
the
lodge
and
he
scanned
the
place
with
interest
until
one
fact
struck
him
forcibly
quickly
he
straightened
up
his
gaze
was
fastened
upon
an
upper
window
in
the
low
loft
space
of
the
lodge
this
window
was
partly
open
and
as
barry
looked
a
certain
conviction
came
to
him
it
s
a
queer
thing
about
that
window
i
ve
looked
over
there
several
times
and
i
can
positively
testify
that
it
wasn
t
open
before
chapter
ix
inside
the
haunted
lodge
barry
lifted
the
ax
and
with
a
single
swing
of
his
arm
imbedded
it
in
the
side
of
the
tree
limb
then
he
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
glanced
inside
mac
was
stacking
the
dishes
up
and
the
other
two
boys
were
just
coming
out
of
the
kitchen
come
here
a
minute
barry
called
to
them
mac
lingered
to
finish
his
work
when
they
had
joined
him
at
the
door
he
pointed
toward
the
lodge
see
anything
strange
about
the
place
he
asked
mac
joined
them
in
the
doorway
and
they
gazed
at
the
hunting
lodge
looks
the
same
as
ever
to
me
tim
said
no
there
is
a
window
half
open
kent
cried
pointing
that
is
just
what
i
wanted
you
to
see
barry
told
them
did
any
of
you
notice
that
it
was
open
before
this
i
m
sure
that
it
wasn
t
mac
said
we
ought
to
have
seen
it
before
this
if
it
was
tim
chimed
in
that
is
exactly
what
i
thought
barry
replied
i
was
cutting
wood
and
while
i
was
resting
i
turned
and
looked
at
the
place
it
came
to
me
at
once
that
all
the
windows
were
down
the
last
time
we
looked
that
then
somebody
has
been
in
the
place
while
we
were
off
hunting
for
the
sled
tim
observed
it
looks
that
way
for
some
reason
he
opened
that
upstairs
window
and
forgot
to
close
it
fellows
we
had
better
go
explore
that
lodge
right
now
we
can
look
for
the
sled
later
the
boys
needed
no
further
urging
they
were
anxious
to
go
through
the
old
place
and
now
that
the
window
had
been
opened
they
were
more
than
eager
to
enter
the
lodge
sweaters
and
caps
were
hastily
put
on
and
barry
got
the
keys
to
the
big
building
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
looking
around
for
the
sled
we
would
have
been
in
that
place
this
morning
he
said
they
crossed
the
snow
to
the
front
porch
of
bluff
lodge
this
porch
extended
clear
across
the
log
building
and
gave
a
magnificent
view
up
and
down
the
lake
yards
from
the
porch
the
bluff
dropped
fourteen
feet
straight
down
to
the
waters
of
arrowtip
dandy
place
to
sit
and
look
out
over
the
lake
on
a
warm
summer
day
kent
commented
as
barry
fitted
his
key
to
the
lock
it
certainly
is
his
chum
agreed
this
lodge
ought
to
be
worth
quite
a
bit
of
money
it
would
be
too
if
it
weren
t
getting
a
bad
by
this
time
barry
had
turned
the
key
and
with
a
grinding
sound
the
bolt
shot
back
the
boys
crowded
closer
to
him
anxious
for
their
first
glimpse
inside
the
haunted
lodge
building
barry
swung
the
door
open
wide
and
they
walked
in
glancing
around
with
interest
they
found
themselves
in
a
wide
hall
that
was
square
and
roomy
a
big
fireplace
took
up
a
wide
space
on
one
side
of
the
wall
and
over
it
hung
the
head
of
an
elk
pictures
adorned
the
walls
and
over
a
door
leading
into
the
other
part
of
the
lodge
hung
an
old
flintlock
gun
a
flight
of
stairs
led
to
the
loft
this
is
a
dandy
place
remarked
mac
as
they
stood
and
looked
around
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
main
room
where
they
sit
around
the
fire
kent
asked
barry
moved
to
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
no
this
seems
to
be
the
living
room
he
announced
stepping
through
the
doorway
the
others
followed
and
found
themselves
in
a
big
living
room
furnished
with
several
chairs
and
a
long
couch
that
was
placed
in
front
of
the
fireplace
shelves
of
books
and
some
animal
skins
were
to
be
seen
in
this
room
and
it
was
unmistakably
the
guest
gathering
place
this
is
more
like
it
tim
remarked
as
they
explored
the
room
that
other
place
is
just
the
front
hall
gosh
but
it
is
cold
in
here
beside
the
fireplace
there
were
window
seats
and
barry
sat
down
and
pulled
the
curtains
aside
you
can
see
our
place
from
here
he
said
this
certainly
is
a
nice
lodge
and
i
d
like
to
own
kent
opened
a
door
from
the
living
room
and
they
continued
to
explore
a
long
hall
led
to
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
and
from
this
hall
three
bedrooms
and
a
dining
room
could
be
reached
it
was
indeed
an
unusually
large
log
structure
wouldn
t
this
be
a
great
place
to
have
a
party
barry
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
boy
it
surely
would
kent
agreed
he
opened
a
door
and
looked
into
one
of
the
bedrooms
look
at
those
nice
beds
and
we
are
sleeping
on
the
floor
over
at
our
cabin
tim
called
their
attention
to
a
pump
on
the
back
porch
here
we
are
melting
down
snow
and
a
good
pump
close
to
bet
it
is
frozen
stiff
barry
objected
even
so
if
some
hot
water
were
poured
down
it
to
prime
it
i
believe
that
we
could
use
it
tim
said
well
let
s
get
on
upstairs
proposed
barry
we
came
over
here
to
see
about
that
they
went
down
the
hall
and
through
the
living
room
to
the
big
hall
barry
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
until
they
came
to
a
door
this
was
not
hard
to
open
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
attic
or
loft
space
of
the
hunting
lodge
it
was
a
large
open
space
and
seemed
to
be
almost
empty
a
broken
bobsled
was
over
against
one
slope
of
the
roof
and
two
dusty
saddles
hung
from
nails
there
were
only
two
windows
in
the
upper
section
of
bluff
lodge
and
one
of
them
was
slightly
open
barry
crossed
the
floor
of
the
attic
and
shut
the
window
peering
out
look
at
those
prints
in
the
snow
he
said
it
seems
as
though
someone
may
have
crossed
the
roof
and
come
in
this
window
there
is
enough
roof
for
anyone
to
walk
then
those
tracks
were
made
some
time
back
reminded
kent
we
haven
t
had
any
snow
lately
you
can
see
how
the
snow
melted
down
into
the
yes
no
doubt
of
it
the
tracks
are
old
barry
agreed
two
chimneys
rose
straight
through
the
attic
and
mac
wandered
around
restlessly
the
chimney
from
the
lower
hall
took
up
little
space
but
the
chimney
rose
several
feet
to
push
its
way
through
the
roof
mac
walked
around
this
brick
column
while
the
others
looked
out
of
the
window
toward
their
cabin
then
they
heard
him
utter
an
exclamation
they
turned
to
see
him
motioning
from
around
the
corner
of
the
chimney
come
here
you
fellows
look
what
i
ve
found
filled
with
curiosity
they
joined
him
behind
the
tall
chimney
and
found
him
pointing
to
a
small
pile
of
snow
that
showed
on
the
floor
barry
knelt
and
touched
it
with
his
finger
it
is
snow
all
right
he
announced
and
that
means
that
somebody
has
been
in
the
lodge
within
the
last
few
minutes
possibly
while
we
were
walking
around
downstairs
mac
reminded
them
chapter
x
a
council
of
war
somewhat
startled
at
mac
s
words
the
others
looked
around
the
loft
and
then
at
each
other
the
thought
that
some
unknown
person
had
been
in
the
building
perhaps
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
downstairs
was
not
a
comforting
one
and
they
felt
the
grip
of
excitement
and
uncertainty
barry
glanced
up
at
the
roof
above
them
no
hole
there
for
this
snow
to
drop
through
and
we
haven
t
any
snow
on
our
shoes
he
murmured
it
surely
looks
like
mac
is
if
somebody
was
here
how
did
he
get
out
tim
asked
peering
into
the
dark
corners
of
the
loft
think
he
slipped
down
the
roof
it
would
be
easy
for
anyone
to
go
out
the
front
door
while
we
were
in
the
kitchen
barry
reminded
them
if
anybody
was
hiding
in
the
lodge
he
could
probably
hear
us
talking
and
then
sneak
down
into
the
hall
and
outdoors
while
we
were
in
the
that
s
just
what
has
happened
kent
exclaimed
with
conviction
barry
crushed
the
snow
under
his
fingers
it
hasn
t
been
here
very
long
he
gave
his
opinion
you
didn
t
have
any
of
it
on
your
shoes
did
you
mac
the
ford
twin
shook
his
head
no
and
i
discovered
it
before
i
had
walked
that
far
i
wasn
t
sure
at
first
what
it
was
and
i
had
to
touch
it
to
make
sure
if
that
fell
off
of
somebody
s
clothes
then
somebody
was
here
just
a
few
minutes
right
you
are
kent
nodded
we
ought
to
go
down
and
look
through
the
house
and
the
sooner
the
better
seconded
barry
rising
from
the
floor
i
must
let
dad
know
about
led
by
kent
the
boys
went
downstairs
and
made
a
hasty
search
through
the
lodge
but
found
nothing
it
was
with
considerable
excitement
that
they
looked
into
each
room
not
at
all
certain
as
to
what
they
would
find
but
no
one
was
in
the
place
at
last
they
gathered
on
the
front
porch
and
looked
up
and
down
the
lake
but
no
one
was
in
sight
let
s
take
a
look
around
the
grounds
tim
suggested
and
they
made
a
tour
of
the
place
in
the
rear
back
of
the
kitchen
and
in
a
separate
building
they
found
a
variety
of
garden
tools
and
odds
and
ends
but
the
shed
itself
was
empty
of
all
life
the
timber
came
close
to
the
back
of
the
lodge
and
if
anyone
had
been
bent
on
vanishing
from
sight
in
that
direction
it
would
not
have
taken
him
long
to
do
so
going
around
on
the
far
side
of
the
lodge
the
boys
saw
that
it
was
more
rugged
land
than
that
on
their
side
a
series
of
ravines
and
gullies
ran
beside
the
lodge
and
less
than
an
eighth
of
mile
away
rose
the
scarred
side
of
the
old
abandoned
quarry
pretty
wild
country
on
this
side
said
barry
as
they
halted
under
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
to
look
around
tim
approached
the
gully
closest
to
the
house
and
gazed
down
into
it
people
who
camp
in
this
lodge
don
t
want
to
go
walking
at
night
he
said
not
in
this
direction
anyway
they
had
i
ll
be
jiggered
what
s
the
matter
they
asked
him
looks
like
our
sled
down
there
it
is
the
others
joined
him
at
the
edge
of
the
gully
down
below
them
a
few
feet
they
could
see
the
sled
partly
turned
over
the
front
runners
buried
under
some
bushes
tim
slipped
down
into
the
depression
and
located
the
rope
so
there
is
where
he
hid
the
sled
kent
exclaimed
and
we
tramped
for
miles
looking
for
it
barry
shook
his
head
tim
toiled
up
the
slope
dragging
the
sled
after
him
he
did
more
than
hide
it
there
he
informed
them
handing
the
rope
to
mac
to
pull
whoever
put
it
there
just
threw
it
in
one
front
runner
is
barry
helped
mac
pull
the
sled
up
it
was
a
low
flat
wooden
affair
with
steel
runners
part
of
the
wood
over
the
front
runner
had
been
smashed
some
nerve
on
the
part
of
whoever
did
it
growled
barry
as
they
examined
it
i
d
like
to
knock
the
stuffing
out
of
the
man
provided
a
man
did
it
kent
said
well
somebody
did
it
and
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
one
who
has
been
prowling
around
this
lodge
i
mean
to
find
this
ghost
or
whatever
it
is
that
is
making
the
trouble
at
this
it
looks
as
though
we
ought
to
do
some
watching
at
night
mac
suggested
as
they
made
their
way
around
to
the
front
of
the
lodge
we
ll
talk
it
over
a
little
later
barry
promised
locking
the
front
door
of
the
lodge
we
ve
got
to
get
our
firewood
in
and
prepare
for
the
night
these
days
are
cutting
wood
and
preparing
for
the
night
took
them
the
rest
of
the
brief
winter
afternoon
and
then
supper
followed
the
sun
had
gone
down
a
dull
and
misty
red
and
the
wind
was
moaning
through
the
trees
there
was
every
indication
of
a
storm
and
the
boys
were
hoping
that
they
would
not
be
snowed
in
i
ll
put
a
splice
on
that
broken
sled
runner
kent
offered
as
they
sat
at
the
supper
table
he
was
the
best
carpenter
of
them
all
and
they
were
willing
to
let
him
do
the
mending
all
right
barry
agreed
that
will
fix
it
so
that
we
can
use
it
on
the
way
home
whoever
took
our
sled
didn
t
steal
the
canvas
or
the
frying
pan
and
the
long
handle
so
he
must
have
taken
it
just
to
scare
us
he
just
gave
the
sled
a
polite
boot
into
the
gully
grumbled
mac
yes
and
that
gets
under
my
skin
cried
barry
he
came
and
stole
our
sled
before
he
knew
why
we
had
come
here
to
camp
i
wouldn
t
think
so
much
of
it
if
he
had
done
that
after
we
had
been
through
the
lodge
but
he
didn
t
even
give
us
that
long
something
has
got
to
be
done
and
we
might
just
as
well
decide
what
it
will
be
right
here
at
this
council
of
maybe
we
ought
to
take
turns
sitting
up
and
looking
out
of
the
window
mac
gave
as
his
idea
a
pretty
cold
thankless
job
kent
shook
his
head
hang
it
all
we
didn
t
do
a
thing
today
about
making
better
beds
and
so
far
i
haven
t
enjoyed
my
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
have
been
thinking
barry
said
slowly
i
believe
that
we
ought
to
move
into
the
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
as
the
others
considered
his
words
slightly
startled
at
the
proposition
but
your
dad
told
you
that
he
wanted
us
to
stay
in
this
cabin
tim
reminded
yes
he
did
at
that
time
barry
agreed
but
the
whole
situation
has
changed
since
then
if
we
are
to
get
on
the
track
of
the
mysterious
spook
of
the
lodge
we
won
t
do
it
from
here
we
ought
to
be
right
inside
of
that
hunting
again
the
boys
were
silent
considering
it
i
know
that
we
will
be
a
whole
lot
more
comfortable
on
those
beds
over
there
than
we
are
here
kent
said
we
ll
be
a
lot
better
off
in
several
ways
barry
pointed
out
it
is
a
bigger
place
and
we
ll
have
more
elbow
room
then
we
ll
be
closer
to
the
actual
scene
of
his
majesty
the
spook
s
that
spook
gets
snow
on
him
same
as
any
human
grinned
mac
of
course
nodded
barry
because
he
is
human
it
s
just
some
mean
person
up
to
a
slippery
game
but
who
it
is
or
why
he
is
at
it
nobody
knows
and
if
we
are
going
to
find
out
we
ll
have
to
hustle
because
our
time
here
is
going
by
let
s
move
over
there
tonight
tim
suggested
for
a
moment
they
were
swayed
by
the
thought
and
then
kent
and
barry
shook
their
heads
together
too
much
of
a
job
at
this
time
of
night
kent
said
we
haven
t
much
to
move
tim
protested
that
s
true
barry
agreed
but
the
lodge
is
too
cold
we
ll
have
to
spend
a
full
day
warming
up
the
place
we
have
only
two
lanterns
and
while
i
noticed
some
lamps
over
there
i
don
t
know
whether
they
have
any
oil
in
them
or
not
we
ll
do
better
to
wait
until
taking
it
by
and
large
i
believe
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
commented
mac
this
little
cabin
does
very
well
as
a
shelter
from
the
storm
but
it
isn
t
very
it
hasn
t
been
well
taken
care
of
answered
kent
looking
around
some
of
the
chinking
is
out
between
the
logs
and
that
lets
the
air
in
this
table
is
thick
with
grease
and
looks
like
it
never
was
mr
bronson
has
been
renting
it
out
for
a
long
time
explained
barry
he
got
up
from
the
table
after
we
have
washed
the
dishes
i
ll
write
a
letter
to
my
father
and
tell
him
that
we
have
decided
to
move
into
the
fact
i
ll
tell
him
everything
he
might
even
run
up
here
i
hope
we
know
something
more
definite
by
the
time
he
does
observed
mac
later
in
the
evening
barry
wrote
a
letter
to
his
father
relating
events
in
detail
and
informing
him
of
their
contemplated
move
while
he
was
busily
engaged
at
this
the
other
three
boys
were
working
on
the
broken
runner
board
kent
had
decided
to
cut
out
a
new
one
from
a
piece
of
board
which
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
and
with
the
aid
of
ax
and
knife
he
managed
to
carve
out
a
fair
section
of
runner
board
with
the
help
of
the
twins
he
fitted
it
into
place
and
before
long
the
job
had
been
successfully
completed
before
they
retired
for
the
night
barry
opened
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
soft
white
flakes
falling
it
s
snowing
he
told
his
chums
looks
as
though
we
are
going
to
move
into
the
lodge
just
in
time
kent
predicted
i
hope
that
this
doesn
t
turn
into
a
blizzard
barry
thought
chapter
xi
a
disturbed
night
the
sight
of
the
falling
snow
gave
the
boys
a
new
channel
for
conversation
and
they
were
slow
about
going
to
bed
they
had
put
everything
soft
that
they
could
find
under
their
sleeping
bags
and
looked
forward
to
a
fairly
comfortable
night
in
the
log
cabin
since
the
snow
had
begun
falling
the
air
had
become
much
warmer
and
the
inside
of
the
little
building
was
warm
and
inviting
it
s
a
thick
heavy
snow
tim
remarked
after
peering
out
of
the
window
if
anyone
comes
near
the
cabin
tonight
we
ought
to
see
his
footprints
in
the
morning
mac
said
maybe
not
kent
denied
if
it
keeps
on
snowing
this
way
any
tracks
would
be
covered
up
in
a
very
short
if
it
kept
up
this
way
for
a
long
time
we
d
be
snowed
in
here
for
a
while
barry
told
them
we
might
not
get
back
to
school
in
that
would
break
my
heart
mac
grinned
don
t
you
want
to
know
anything
you
ignorant
duffer
kent
asked
i
thought
i
knew
about
all
there
was
to
know
mac
returned
blandly
then
you
re
smarter
than
most
humans
barry
retorted
i
accept
grinned
the
twin
we
ll
ask
pa
about
that
sometime
said
tim
slipping
inside
the
bag
i
bet
he
ll
have
a
different
the
fire
blazed
up
in
the
chimney
and
the
shadows
leaped
and
darted
on
the
walls
a
split
log
popped
and
a
blazing
ember
shot
out
across
the
hearth
and
landed
close
to
kent
s
sleeping
bag
he
put
his
arm
outside
of
the
bag
and
flicked
it
back
into
the
fireplace
if
any
of
you
get
hot
in
the
night
you
ll
know
that
a
spark
landed
on
you
he
said
if
you
know
so
much
what
made
that
wood
pop
like
that
barry
asked
mac
expansion
heat
expanded
it
and
made
it
all
right
what
made
that
popping
sound
that
is
a
secret
that
we
scientific
men
keep
to
ourselves
answered
mac
soberly
i
wish
you
d
all
quit
talking
about
such
nonsense
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
grumbled
kent
i
m
tired
after
our
tramping
around
yes
let
s
go
to
sleep
mac
urged
tomorrow
i
ll
explain
all
these
deep
things
to
you
thanks
said
barry
we
can
hardly
wait
until
we
hear
them
the
others
were
as
tired
as
kent
and
they
were
willing
to
drop
their
conversation
and
drift
off
into
slumber
nor
did
it
take
them
long
they
were
active
and
healthy
boys
and
sleep
was
a
thing
that
they
needed
and
enjoyed
in
a
few
moments
they
were
all
breathing
deeply
and
quiet
settled
over
the
bronson
cabin
the
fire
continued
to
flare
and
occasionally
it
popped
but
no
more
embers
left
the
chimney
the
snow
came
down
gently
and
settled
on
the
frame
of
the
window
until
the
little
panes
became
round
from
the
clinging
white
flakes
the
wind
was
rising
slightly
and
now
and
then
a
puff
came
down
the
chimney
and
caused
the
fire
to
leap
and
twist
upward
the
slumbers
of
the
mystery
hunters
were
rudely
broken
into
by
a
sudden
medley
of
shots
and
yells
the
boys
woke
up
with
a
start
and
as
they
did
so
two
more
shots
rang
out
then
stillness
succeeded
what
was
that
barry
asked
as
they
sat
up
in
the
bags
and
looked
around
in
the
semigloom
the
fire
had
sunk
down
and
a
glance
at
an
old
alarm
clock
that
kent
had
brought
with
him
and
which
stood
on
the
stone
chimneypiece
showed
that
it
was
a
quarter
of
two
shots
was
kent
s
answer
as
he
kicked
his
way
out
of
the
bag
several
of
them
and
close
to
here
i
heard
some
yells
put
in
tim
all
four
of
them
were
now
up
and
hastening
into
their
clothes
mac
swiftly
tossed
some
wood
on
the
fire
and
in
the
increasing
light
they
hurriedly
dressed
barry
peered
out
of
the
window
as
he
pulled
his
sweater
down
i
don
t
see
anybody
he
said
it
is
still
kent
took
his
rifle
from
a
nail
upon
which
he
had
hung
it
and
handed
barry
his
i
guess
we
had
better
take
these
with
us
he
said
no
knowing
who
is
out
there
shooting
from
the
yells
we
heard
it
sounds
as
though
somebody
was
winged
mac
said
as
he
took
the
shotgun
that
the
twins
shared
between
them
tim
placed
his
ax
in
his
belt
and
they
were
ready
to
go
out
into
the
night
and
investigate
barry
opened
the
door
and
they
stepped
out
it
was
still
snowing
but
the
flakes
were
finer
now
and
there
was
a
brisk
wind
that
moaned
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
whipped
the
snow
into
whirling
shapes
and
formations
the
boys
left
the
cabin
cautiously
but
no
one
challenged
their
coming
and
they
stood
in
the
snow
outside
the
door
their
hands
in
pockets
feeling
the
change
from
the
warm
inside
to
the
cold
outdoors
much
snow
had
fallen
since
they
had
gone
to
bed
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
listening
for
any
sound
that
might
break
the
stillness
or
rise
above
the
gusts
of
wind
but
although
they
strained
their
powers
of
hearing
no
sound
reached
them
then
a
flash
of
light
out
on
the
lake
caught
their
attention
it
lingered
only
a
moment
and
then
was
gone
and
after
a
brief
interval
it
came
again
somebody
is
running
across
the
ice
barry
and
mac
said
in
chorus
yes
kent
agreed
and
they
have
a
flashlight
that
they
are
turning
on
every
once
in
a
while
wonder
who
they
are
i
ll
bet
they
are
the
ones
that
yelled
said
tim
heading
for
rake
island
barry
observed
maybe
whoever
is
putting
on
all
the
funny
business
around
the
lodge
hides
away
on
rake
island
kent
suggested
we
ought
to
search
that
place
one
of
these
we
will
barry
promised
he
glanced
toward
the
dark
hunting
lodge
which
way
did
those
shots
come
from
i
d
say
from
just
behind
the
lodge
tim
answered
seemed
that
way
to
me
kent
agreed
they
were
mighty
close
to
this
cabin
of
let
s
go
over
there
and
see
if
we
can
find
anything
barry
suggested
i
ll
get
the
lantern
mac
offered
you
fellows
want
your
hats
and
gloves
they
agreed
heartily
that
they
did
for
the
night
air
was
penetrating
and
before
long
the
twin
was
back
with
the
lantern
and
their
warmer
clothing
in
a
short
time
they
set
out
across
the
open
space
toward
the
lodge
keeping
a
sharp
watch
on
every
side
the
flashes
no
longer
came
from
the
lake
back
of
the
lodge
they
flashed
the
lantern
around
the
ground
looking
for
footprints
but
the
snow
had
been
blown
around
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
find
any
they
did
not
waste
many
minutes
in
the
hunt
as
the
cold
was
too
keen
but
soon
gave
it
up
and
started
back
to
the
cabin
nothing
doing
barry
announced
and
i
m
not
going
to
stay
out
here
long
that
wind
feels
like
a
knife
me
for
the
fire
his
companions
were
of
the
same
mind
and
they
were
approaching
the
cabin
when
tim
stopped
and
fumbled
into
the
snow
when
he
straightened
up
he
held
an
object
in
his
hand
and
as
soon
as
he
had
wiped
it
off
he
whistled
hey
look
here
fellows
a
rifle
shell
the
boys
bent
over
his
extended
hand
and
examined
the
metal
cartridge
with
interest
then
kent
began
to
brush
through
the
snow
in
search
of
others
before
long
he
had
found
three
more
this
is
where
the
fellow
stood
that
fired
those
shots
he
announced
pretty
close
to
our
cabin
barry
said
these
shells
came
out
of
a
big
rifle
mac
observed
did
you
see
that
shell
on
the
ground
tim
no
my
foot
struck
it
i
felt
something
harder
than
the
snow
and
i
reached
down
to
see
what
it
was
as
soon
as
i
touched
it
i
had
an
idea
what
it
barry
looked
away
in
the
direction
of
rake
island
shrouded
in
the
darkness
it
all
means
that
somebody
stood
here
and
fired
at
least
four
shots
from
a
rifle
at
someone
else
he
said
slowly
the
ones
who
were
shot
at
scuttled
away
across
the
ice
i
d
like
to
know
what
it
all
let
s
get
in
around
the
fire
and
look
these
shells
over
kent
urged
and
they
were
soon
back
in
the
cabin
grouping
around
the
warm
fire
and
looking
at
the
empty
cartridge
curiously
the
ones
that
kent
had
found
were
exactly
the
same
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
had
all
been
shot
from
the
same
gun
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
more
than
four
shots
but
perhaps
i
just
imagined
that
barry
said
sitting
down
on
the
sleeping
bag
the
whole
thing
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
i
hardly
know
what
did
happen
mac
admitted
the
shots
were
near
us
almost
outside
of
our
window
kent
nodded
gosh
that
gives
me
something
to
think
about
do
you
know
it
the
light
of
our
fire
would
show
anyone
that
we
were
here
and
whoever
fired
the
shots
might
have
been
protecting
us
see
what
i
mean
do
you
mean
that
those
people
who
ran
across
the
ice
may
have
been
looking
in
at
us
and
were
scared
off
by
the
shots
tim
asked
sure
or
maybe
the
ones
who
did
the
shooting
were
looking
in
at
us
and
were
disturbed
of
course
any
way
you
look
at
it
it
is
all
pure
guesswork
and
we
know
as
much
about
it
as
we
do
about
the
whole
mystery
i
m
glad
that
we
are
going
to
move
over
into
the
lodge
declared
barry
that
s
a
bigger
place
and
i
ll
feel
safer
in
don
t
forget
though
that
the
lodge
is
the
home
stamping
ground
for
the
spook
mac
reminded
him
i
know
it
is
but
we
seem
to
have
had
a
lot
of
visitors
and
prowlers
around
here
i
don
t
feel
quite
safe
any
more
if
we
did
stay
in
this
cabin
we
d
have
to
build
some
sort
of
a
shutter
to
put
over
that
window
so
that
people
couldn
t
come
looking
do
you
believe
it
was
any
of
carter
wolf
s
friends
tim
inquired
barry
smiled
we
re
trying
to
hang
everything
against
his
account
just
because
he
has
no
use
for
us
no
i
hardly
think
so
i
wonder
if
any
of
his
bunch
carries
a
rifle
big
enough
for
these
shells
they
might
kent
said
some
of
his
friends
are
sports
and
have
good
equipment
we
know
that
he
is
somewhere
near
here
but
i
just
don
t
think
that
they
had
anything
to
do
with
it
well
that
artillery
practice
was
too
close
to
suit
me
mac
declared
as
he
began
to
get
ready
for
bed
again
i
m
just
wondering
if
anyone
was
hit
or
if
they
just
yelled
because
they
were
scared
murmured
barry
as
the
boys
prepared
to
go
to
sleep
again
i
suppose
we
should
have
gone
on
down
to
the
lake
to
see
if
anyone
was
hurt
or
not
admitted
tim
mac
placed
fresh
fuel
on
the
fire
and
they
talked
for
another
about
the
mysterious
event
of
the
night
the
wind
was
rising
and
blowing
more
strongly
and
the
old
cabin
shook
under
the
force
of
some
of
the
blasts
at
length
the
boys
became
quiet
and
sank
away
into
deep
sleep
it
seemed
that
they
had
scarcely
closed
their
eyes
when
there
came
a
thunderous
booming
crash
that
jarred
the
cabin
something
scraped
down
the
roof
and
fell
to
the
ground
back
of
the
kitchen
at
the
same
time
some
stones
fell
into
the
fire
which
had
sunk
to
red
embers
scattering
it
to
right
and
left
the
boys
bounded
up
from
their
beds
with
rapidly
beating
hearts
what
was
that
tim
shouted
something
hit
the
cabin
barry
said
as
he
reached
for
his
clothes
again
yes
and
it
took
part
of
the
chimney
mac
pointed
out
i
ll
get
a
light
and
we
ll
see
what
it
kent
threw
the
remaining
wood
on
the
fire
and
mac
lighted
the
lantern
it
was
just
five
o
clock
an
hour
which
rather
surprised
the
boys
as
it
was
still
pitch
dark
outside
they
dressed
as
quickly
as
possible
waiting
for
further
sounds
but
all
was
still
do
you
suppose
that
somebody
bumped
against
the
side
of
the
cabin
mac
asked
bumped
it
with
a
battering
ram
if
he
did
barry
retorted
that
thump
was
on
the
roof
let
s
see
what
it
he
seized
the
lantern
and
the
others
followed
him
out
into
the
air
the
blackness
was
growing
faintly
gray
in
the
east
and
before
very
long
the
sun
would
be
up
but
the
boys
were
not
interested
in
these
things
at
that
moment
they
walked
out
to
a
place
where
they
could
look
at
the
roof
of
the
cabin
one
glance
told
the
story
a
big
limb
had
blown
down
and
landed
on
the
roof
knocking
off
a
corner
of
the
chimney
part
of
the
limb
had
slid
down
the
back
part
of
the
roof
but
the
heaviest
portion
was
still
balanced
on
the
peak
of
the
roof
a
tree
limb
kent
cried
we
might
have
known
a
big
one
too
barry
observed
we
ll
have
to
pull
it
down
before
we
leave
this
i
thought
the
whole
house
was
coming
down
when
it
hit
mac
grinned
are
you
going
to
go
back
to
sleep
tim
inquired
sleep
echoed
kent
in
disgust
not
for
me
it
s
morning
anyway
if
we
did
go
to
sleep
something
else
would
be
sure
to
happen
i
m
sleepy
but
no
more
for
me
what
a
fine
night
that
turned
out
to
be
chapter
xii
a
surprise
visit
satisfied
by
their
inspection
the
boys
now
went
back
into
the
cabin
and
began
to
fix
things
in
order
all
of
them
felt
sleepy
and
somewhat
dragged
out
but
in
no
mood
to
return
to
the
sleeping
bags
faint
streaks
of
real
daylight
were
spread
across
the
sky
and
a
new
day
was
at
hand
it
was
still
snowing
lightly
and
the
wind
was
cutting
and
sharp
before
long
it
was
evident
that
there
would
be
no
sunshine
that
day
the
sky
was
heavy
and
overcast
the
trees
were
loaded
with
a
mass
of
clinging
white
flakes
and
the
whole
landscape
was
clothed
in
a
simple
beauty
that
the
boys
admired
with
enthusiasm
if
the
sun
would
come
out
how
this
snow
would
flash
and
sparkle
kent
remarked
as
they
tucked
away
the
bedding
and
prepared
to
get
breakfast
no
sun
today
barry
predicted
in
fact
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
we
have
more
going
to
move
over
into
that
lodge
this
morning
mac
inquired
i
guess
so
barry
nodded
but
first
we
want
to
go
down
to
the
lake
and
see
if
we
can
find
any
clues
to
what
went
on
last
we
ought
to
scout
around
a
little
and
see
if
we
can
find
anyone
in
the
woods
who
did
the
shooting
tim
suggested
we
ll
do
the
best
we
can
barry
assured
them
i
want
to
get
to
the
post
office
at
fox
point
and
mail
my
letter
to
dad
we
won
t
be
here
much
no
we
won
t
worse
luck
sighed
kent
i
d
like
to
stay
right
here
until
we
do
solve
the
looks
like
we
aren
t
going
to
mac
shook
his
head
it
gets
deeper
all
the
somebody
has
got
to
get
more
wood
tim
called
from
the
who
are
the
brave
lads
who
will
volunteer
to
chop
or
die
for
their
native
land
i
m
brave
but
this
isn
t
my
native
land
barry
grinned
you
d
better
do
it
tim
mac
suggested
you
re
always
carrying
a
little
hatchet
around
in
your
that
s
no
hatchet
that
happens
to
be
an
ax
growled
tim
i
m
all
set
to
cook
breakfast
and
as
it
is
going
to
be
a
tough
job
to
cut
wood
under
the
snow
i
m
calling
for
volunteers
he
s
honest
about
it
commented
barry
it
is
hard
work
so
he
wants
somebody
else
to
do
i
ll
do
the
chopping
kent
said
suddenly
come
on
mac
you
go
with
mac
stared
at
him
suspiciously
you
seem
mighty
anxious
where
are
you
going
to
find
a
log
to
cut
into
upon
the
roof
my
boy
grinned
kent
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
toss
a
rope
up
and
snake
it
down
once
it
descends
to
the
ground
we
will
fall
on
it
tooth
and
nail
and
reduce
it
to
kindling
wood
mac
seized
his
ax
with
alacrity
and
that
means
that
the
next
time
wood
is
cut
those
two
have
to
cut
it
wherever
they
can
find
it
doesn
t
it
that
s
fine
let
s
go
we
re
sold
barry
smiled
at
tim
the
boys
have
put
one
over
on
mac
and
kent
went
to
work
at
once
on
the
limb
that
hung
over
the
peak
of
the
roof
standing
on
kent
s
shoulders
the
twin
looped
a
rope
over
a
jagged
stump
of
a
limb
and
then
jumped
to
the
ground
both
of
them
pulled
on
the
rope
and
the
limb
came
sliding
down
the
roof
and
thudded
to
the
ground
a
good
dry
piece
of
timber
kent
exulted
this
will
be
easy
to
chop
up
for
they
fell
to
their
task
with
a
will
and
soon
had
an
pile
heaped
up
close
to
the
front
door
barry
came
out
to
get
some
of
it
and
tim
started
the
fire
in
the
rusty
stove
before
long
the
delicious
smell
of
bacon
drifted
out
to
the
mac
stopped
and
sniffed
with
rapture
boy
just
smell
that
bacon
isn
t
that
the
finest
aroma
in
the
world
it
certainly
is
when
you
are
out
camping
kent
granted
everything
seems
to
taste
so
good
when
you
are
out
in
the
open
a
whole
bacon
eggs
and
coffee
what
a
combination
say
while
you
fellows
are
at
fox
point
today
why
don
t
you
get
some
sausage
we
ll
ask
barry
or
whoever
goes
to
get
breakfast
was
soon
ready
and
they
tackled
it
with
enthusiasm
just
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
they
set
the
cabin
in
order
all
of
them
were
anxious
to
get
out
and
explore
the
lake
front
but
they
were
good
campers
and
had
an
instinctive
aversion
to
leaving
the
camp
until
it
was
in
condition
this
was
speedily
done
and
then
they
donned
their
outside
coats
and
their
hats
and
were
ready
to
go
taking
guns
kent
asked
might
as
well
barry
said
not
that
we
expect
to
use
them
for
defensive
purposes
but
we
might
see
some
game
that
we
can
knock
they
left
the
cabin
and
locked
the
door
after
them
nothing
in
there
of
value
except
our
provisions
skates
and
sled
mac
remarked
but
i
suppose
it
is
best
to
lock
we
ll
explore
a
little
and
then
get
back
to
our
moving
barry
proposed
as
they
plodded
along
through
the
snow
down
the
slope
to
the
lake
we
don
t
want
to
spend
another
night
in
the
bronson
they
soon
reached
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
searched
it
for
footprints
or
other
clues
but
were
unable
to
find
anything
proceeding
along
the
edge
of
the
frozen
water
they
hiked
almost
as
far
east
as
the
mouth
of
the
buffalo
river
when
they
were
opposite
rake
island
kent
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
and
pointed
look
some
fellows
are
on
rake
island
see
them
watching
us
glancing
across
the
ice
sheet
they
saw
five
figures
standing
in
a
group
apparently
looking
in
their
direction
just
as
they
noticed
them
the
group
on
the
little
island
started
across
the
lake
toward
them
the
boys
at
once
halted
they
are
coming
right
at
us
barry
remarked
doesn
t
it
look
like
carter
wolf
in
the
lead
tim
asked
kent
nodded
just
what
i
thought
we
re
in
for
five
to
four
murmured
mac
hold
your
horses
barry
advised
we
don
t
know
what
they
want
and
besides
that
we
have
guns
and
they
haven
t
anything
in
their
hands
don
t
let
them
get
near
enough
to
take
anything
away
from
you
maybe
they
only
want
to
buy
i
can
t
very
well
picture
carter
wolf
wanting
to
buy
anything
from
us
kent
shook
his
head
the
members
of
the
island
camp
soon
drew
close
to
them
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
carter
wolf
and
some
of
his
friends
from
a
neighboring
town
these
boys
were
expensively
dressed
and
wolf
wore
a
big
fur
coat
and
hat
that
looked
odd
as
a
camping
outfit
they
carried
no
weapons
with
them
and
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
what
their
object
was
they
approached
the
mystery
hunters
and
the
silence
between
the
two
groups
was
strained
barry
decided
to
make
the
advances
he
greeted
the
other
boys
made
no
answer
but
they
slowed
up
and
finally
stopped
a
few
feet
away
wolf
s
face
wore
a
frown
and
his
companions
stood
slightly
in
back
of
him
they
were
all
boys
who
did
not
look
especially
healthy
and
the
boys
from
the
cabin
knew
that
they
were
all
drinkers
and
considered
themselves
to
be
good
sports
you
tried
pretty
hard
to
hit
us
last
night
didn
t
you
wolf
began
aggressively
we
didn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
whatever
happened
last
night
barry
answered
him
you
ll
have
to
tell
us
all
about
we
believe
that
sneered
wolf
just
because
you
saw
us
sitting
on
the
porch
of
that
lodge
you
blazed
away
at
us
i
can
have
you
arrested
for
kent
looked
at
him
coldly
the
fact
of
the
matter
wolf
is
that
we
were
asleep
in
the
bronson
cabin
at
the
time
that
shooting
happened
we
got
dressed
and
came
out
as
soon
as
we
could
and
you
and
your
friends
were
running
across
the
ice
we
didn
t
have
a
thing
to
do
with
i
suppose
i
m
to
believe
it
or
not
scoffed
the
boy
from
the
island
tim
dug
down
into
his
mackinaw
pocket
i
guess
we
can
soon
settle
that
question
he
said
here
are
the
empty
shells
that
we
picked
up
outside
our
cabin
after
the
shooting
you
can
see
that
they
are
far
too
big
for
our
little
rifles
and
you
know
that
it
wasn
t
a
shotgun
that
was
fired
at
you
need
any
further
proof
it
was
evident
that
the
boys
from
rake
island
did
not
but
they
were
in
anything
but
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
they
were
anxious
to
make
trouble
but
had
no
ground
to
stand
on
wolf
tried
a
new
line
of
attack
your
father
has
charge
of
that
lodge
he
accused
barry
if
anything
had
happened
to
us
he
would
have
been
responsible
we
had
been
up
the
lake
to
a
dance
hall
and
came
back
late
all
we
did
was
to
sit
down
on
the
porch
of
the
lodge
because
hodge
here
was
don
t
be
telling
all
you
know
spoke
up
a
boy
with
a
pasty
face
well
anyway
somebody
shot
at
us
wolf
went
on
if
we
had
been
hit
your
father
would
have
had
to
pay
for
i
don
t
think
so
barry
denied
i
guess
you
know
that
the
lodge
has
the
name
of
being
haunted
and
you
were
taking
your
own
chances
when
you
sat
on
the
some
fine
day
our
bunch
will
go
up
there
and
crash
in
wolf
boasted
we
ll
see
what
all
this
ghost
business
if
you
can
find
out
what
it
is
my
father
will
be
grateful
to
you
barry
assured
him
but
i
wouldn
t
crash
into
the
lodge
if
i
were
in
your
don
t
give
me
advice
garrison
i
don
t
need
any
and
if
i
did
i
wouldn
t
come
to
you
for
it
you
know
that
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
to
square
accounts
with
you
i
m
going
to
you
haven
t
any
account
to
square
barry
returned
levelly
you
just
think
you
have
we
re
not
looking
for
any
trouble
with
you
wolf
and
the
farther
you
stay
away
from
us
the
better
we
ll
like
it
i
think
we
ought
to
give
you
fellows
a
good
beating
cried
wolf
starting
forward
but
a
companion
named
carl
voss
pulled
him
back
quickly
come
on
back
to
camp
and
leave
these
kids
alone
he
advised
his
eyes
upon
the
weapons
hanging
across
the
boys
arms
they
didn
t
shoot
at
wolf
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
away
but
his
eyes
were
sullen
and
revengeful
some
day
it
will
be
my
turn
to
crow
was
his
parting
word
looks
like
you
re
doing
all
the
crowing
right
now
murmured
tim
as
they
watched
the
other
party
start
back
to
the
island
chapter
xiii
in
the
grip
of
the
storm
for
a
few
moments
the
boys
from
the
cabin
camp
watched
the
rake
island
boys
walk
across
the
ice
and
then
barry
turned
away
come
on
he
said
we
haven
t
time
to
stand
around
idle
remember
that
we
want
to
move
today
and
already
we
have
spent
a
good
part
of
the
the
other
followed
him
and
they
started
back
to
the
camp
we
ve
learned
something
anyway
kent
remarked
yes
it
was
the
wolf
bunch
that
was
shot
at
mac
nodded
still
we
re
just
as
much
as
ever
in
the
dark
as
to
who
did
the
shooting
tim
reminded
them
it
looks
to
me
as
though
whoever
did
the
shooting
did
it
to
scare
them
off
said
barry
they
weren
t
hit
and
didn
t
say
anything
about
the
shots
going
overhead
i
guess
that
crowd
didn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
taking
our
for
a
while
i
thought
that
they
did
confessed
kent
but
evidently
they
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
somebody
keeps
mighty
close
tabs
on
the
lodge
and
even
objects
when
anybody
sits
on
the
front
what
will
they
do
when
we
go
to
live
in
the
place
barry
asked
they
may
make
it
warm
for
us
tim
suggested
so
far
we
have
been
living
in
the
bronson
cabin
and
they
haven
t
done
any
more
than
steal
our
sled
and
throw
it
into
a
ravine
but
now
we
are
moving
up
on
the
ghost
and
maybe
things
will
get
scared
mac
asked
no
but
i
believe
we
ought
to
be
prepared
for
we
will
be
barry
agreed
perhaps
we
ought
to
take
turns
staying
up
at
night
and
keeping
a
strict
watch
i
have
an
idea
that
some
dangerous
criminal
is
operating
around
that
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
counterfeiters
making
money
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
mac
mused
it
may
be
barry
admitted
whatever
they
are
someone
doesn
t
want
anybody
to
hang
around
the
lodge
we
ll
just
have
to
show
them
that
we
intend
to
stay
that
s
the
talk
kent
approved
still
discussing
the
things
nearest
their
minds
the
boys
arrived
at
the
cabin
close
to
dinner
time
after
some
thought
they
decided
to
postpone
their
moving
until
the
afternoon
tim
and
i
can
move
the
things
over
if
you
and
kent
want
to
go
to
fox
point
mac
told
barry
i
ought
to
go
mail
my
letter
barry
said
and
we
need
some
things
from
the
store
there
kerosene
in
particular
our
lantern
is
about
empty
and
we
ll
want
some
oil
for
the
lamps
in
the
not
to
forget
mac
s
sausage
smiled
kent
it
won
t
take
us
any
time
to
move
our
few
things
over
there
tim
said
you
boys
go
ahead
and
we
ll
manage
the
domestic
this
was
agreed
to
and
after
the
midday
meal
kent
and
barry
prepared
to
start
out
they
took
the
sled
with
them
but
decided
not
to
skate
that
would
be
a
couple
of
miles
up
the
lake
and
then
down
the
river
kent
argued
we
can
cut
our
distance
by
going
through
the
the
ice
is
almost
covered
with
snow
anyway
observed
barry
we
can
hike
it
as
quickly
as
we
could
strapping
the
long
kerosene
oil
container
to
the
sled
they
were
ready
to
start
out
the
twins
watched
them
from
the
door
if
you
come
to
a
good
hill
you
can
sit
on
the
sled
and
coast
down
mac
grinned
that
will
be
all
right
if
you
don
t
run
up
against
a
stump
tim
added
barry
slipped
the
sled
rope
through
his
belt
and
they
were
off
see
you
in
our
new
quarters
before
long
he
called
back
have
a
warm
fire
by
the
time
we
get
there
kent
requested
don
t
forget
coffee
and
butter
tim
yelled
and
sausage
mac
whooped
with
a
laugh
and
a
reassuring
wave
the
two
boys
with
the
sled
entered
the
woods
and
were
lost
to
sight
barry
and
kent
struck
off
in
a
southeasterly
direction
through
the
woods
they
knew
that
fox
point
lay
in
that
direction
and
were
interested
to
see
how
near
they
would
come
to
it
there
was
no
definite
path
to
follow
and
so
they
wound
around
bluffs
and
between
the
trees
checking
their
course
by
a
pocket
compass
the
forest
was
a
fairly
open
one
and
the
trees
stood
well
apart
making
it
easy
to
draw
the
sled
underfoot
the
snow
made
a
soft
carpet
the
entire
day
had
been
a
gloomy
one
and
the
sky
was
gray
and
heavy
with
a
strong
hint
of
snow
in
it
darkness
would
come
quickly
and
the
two
boys
were
aware
of
the
fact
and
determined
to
lose
no
time
in
making
the
trip
if
we
push
on
at
a
fast
pace
we
should
be
back
at
the
lodge
before
it
gets
dark
kent
said
as
they
crossed
a
brook
and
started
up
a
hill
slope
we
won
t
linger
in
the
store
barry
promised
it
will
be
dark
earlier
than
usual
tonight
and
we
ll
have
to
make
a
flying
trip
of
it
i
suppose
we
should
have
started
out
this
i
guess
so
if
we
had
wanted
to
take
our
time
about
it
oh
well
i
m
sure
that
we
ll
make
it
all
right
beginning
to
snow
isn
t
it
kent
was
right
lazy
flakes
of
snow
began
to
drift
down
through
the
trees
and
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
they
could
see
for
some
distance
in
every
direction
the
air
was
filled
with
softly
falling
flakes
if
it
doesn
t
come
down
any
harder
than
that
it
won
t
bother
us
any
kent
remarked
hard
to
tell
about
that
his
companion
said
some
pretty
hard
storms
start
out
mildly
those
clouds
above
look
to
be
full
however
we
won
t
borrow
trouble
until
we
have
they
crossed
a
somewhat
thicker
section
of
timber
and
came
to
the
top
of
another
rise
of
ground
barry
pointed
ahead
of
them
see
that
church
steeple
i
believe
that
is
fox
if
it
is
we
ve
hit
it
pretty
well
it
won
t
be
long
before
we
know
for
they
set
off
once
more
and
before
long
came
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
saw
the
little
crossroads
village
of
fox
point
before
them
a
few
houses
a
general
store
and
a
church
and
school
building
made
up
the
tiny
country
village
the
boys
went
at
once
to
the
store
and
leaving
the
sled
outside
were
soon
warming
their
hands
at
the
big
iron
stove
in
the
center
of
the
store
then
barry
began
to
order
supplies
and
kent
wandered
to
the
window
looking
down
into
the
road
presently
he
called
to
his
companion
i
wonder
if
that
is
the
french
couple
that
mac
and
tim
saw
barry
joined
him
at
the
window
and
looked
down
two
horses
were
tied
to
a
railing
at
a
water
trough
which
was
empty
and
as
the
boys
looked
out
at
the
scene
a
man
and
woman
got
on
the
horses
barry
recognized
the
man
at
once
yes
that
is
the
fellow
who
came
into
our
camp
that
morning
he
said
filled
with
curiosity
the
storekeeper
came
over
and
joined
them
at
the
window
the
boys
watched
the
french
couple
ride
off
and
enter
a
path
that
led
into
the
woods
below
the
town
those
people
been
around
these
parts
a
few
days
the
owner
of
the
store
confided
you
acquainted
with
them
no
but
early
one
morning
the
man
was
standing
looking
over
our
camp
barry
told
him
two
of
our
friends
visited
them
in
their
camp
once
but
we
don
t
know
anything
about
them
do
you
the
storekeeper
went
around
the
counter
and
began
to
tie
up
packages
i
know
they
are
mighty
mysterious
people
won
t
say
who
they
are
or
what
they
want
the
other
night
they
come
in
the
store
and
i
asked
them
what
i
could
do
for
them
said
they
didn
t
want
nothin
but
to
wait
for
somebody
pretty
soon
a
car
come
along
and
blowed
the
horn
outside
and
they
went
out
to
it
and
that
was
the
last
i
see
of
them
until
today
nobody
knows
anything
about
they
didn
t
have
any
rifles
today
barry
said
to
kent
when
the
storekeeper
had
moved
off
i
noticed
that
they
must
have
settled
somewhere
to
kent
chuckled
i
ll
bet
it
hurts
these
people
not
to
know
what
they
are
doing
the
packages
were
soon
ready
and
the
boys
took
them
out
and
tied
them
in
place
over
the
top
they
spread
the
canvas
to
keep
the
snow
out
and
then
they
were
ready
barry
looked
around
and
then
shook
his
head
it
is
beginning
to
snow
harder
and
faster
he
said
we
ll
have
to
step
right
leaving
fox
point
behind
them
the
two
boys
started
off
through
the
woods
toward
bluff
lodge
striding
along
as
fast
as
they
could
the
snow
was
coming
down
hard
and
before
they
had
gone
two
miles
it
was
blinding
the
two
chums
said
very
little
but
both
of
them
were
apprehensive
as
the
sky
grew
darker
and
the
whirling
flakes
more
bewildering
their
clothing
became
white
we
got
into
a
good
one
this
time
barry
called
to
kent
as
they
rounded
a
high
rocky
ledge
you
re
right
say
did
we
pass
that
ledge
on
the
way
to
fox
point
i
think
so
hang
it
all
i
can
hardly
see
they
pressed
on
picturing
the
twins
in
the
lodge
with
a
warm
and
glowing
fire
to
welcome
them
the
loaded
sled
was
a
trifle
heavy
owing
to
the
opposition
of
the
increasing
depth
of
snow
and
they
relieved
each
other
frequently
they
had
traveled
on
for
over
a
peering
through
the
storm
and
almost
feeling
their
way
when
kent
stopped
and
pointed
look
there
is
that
same
ledge
we
ve
come
around
in
a
complete
circle
barry
nodded
bitterly
we
have
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
we
re
just
lost
and
if
you
ask
me
we
ve
managed
to
get
lost
at
a
mighty
serious
time
chapter
xiv
new
quarters
the
twins
watched
the
departure
of
their
chums
and
then
turned
back
into
the
house
mac
closed
the
door
and
walked
over
to
the
fire
rubbing
his
hands
it
doesn
t
do
to
get
far
away
from
the
fire
these
days
he
grinned
not
for
long
his
brother
admitted
we
had
better
get
over
to
the
lodge
and
start
a
fire
there
that
place
is
going
to
be
yes
and
it
will
take
some
time
to
warm
it
up
too
did
barry
leave
the
key
tim
took
it
from
his
pocket
here
it
is
let
s
take
some
of
the
stuff
and
go
on
over
they
put
on
coats
and
hats
and
taking
a
few
things
with
them
left
the
bronson
cabin
and
crossed
to
the
lodge
tim
unlocked
the
front
door
of
bluff
lodge
and
they
went
in
the
interior
of
the
lodge
was
cold
and
their
breath
stood
out
in
dense
white
clouds
without
lingering
in
the
hall
they
went
directly
to
the
big
living
room
and
put
their
equipment
on
the
window
seats
the
first
thing
we
had
better
do
mac
suggested
is
to
get
the
fire
going
this
fireplace
looks
like
a
good
one
and
it
shouldn
t
take
long
want
to
put
paper
in
while
i
go
haul
a
load
of
wood
on
the
sled
we
haven
t
got
the
sled
tim
reminded
him
barry
and
kent
have
it
so
you
ll
have
to
carry
some
that
s
so
i
had
forgotten
they
took
the
sled
to
bring
home
the
or
your
sausage
tim
grinned
it
won
t
be
mine
alone
you
know
that
you
like
it
yourself
and
so
do
the
other
boys
well
i
ll
be
back
in
a
few
seconds
with
some
we
haven
t
got
much
of
it
tim
said
we
ll
have
to
cut
some
i
know
it
that
is
the
biggest
job
we
mac
left
the
lodge
and
tim
busied
himself
piling
some
newspaper
which
he
had
brought
in
the
fireplace
there
were
some
ashes
left
from
a
previous
fire
and
he
cleaned
them
out
and
carried
them
in
a
pail
to
the
kitchen
where
he
unlocked
the
back
door
and
took
the
pail
out
to
where
the
bushes
grew
in
a
wild
tangle
here
he
dumped
the
ashes
and
then
looked
around
the
door
of
the
bronson
cabin
was
open
and
he
could
see
mac
inside
returning
to
the
lodge
his
eyes
lighted
on
a
small
shed
joined
to
the
kitchen
it
was
one
part
of
the
lodge
that
they
had
not
inspected
and
his
curiosity
was
aroused
wonder
what
that
place
is
but
i
suppose
it
is
locked
he
tried
the
knob
on
the
door
that
led
to
the
small
shed
and
found
that
it
was
locked
the
key
ring
for
the
lodge
was
still
in
his
pocket
and
he
took
it
out
examining
the
keys
closely
the
key
to
this
shed
may
be
on
the
ring
nothing
like
he
fitted
two
keys
to
the
lock
on
the
shed
and
the
second
one
fitted
one
turn
and
the
lock
slipped
back
he
pulled
the
door
open
and
peered
inside
then
he
gave
a
whistle
of
surprise
and
pleasure
coal
by
ginger
half
a
shed
full
of
coal
i
must
tell
mac
about
he
did
not
linger
long
out
in
the
crisp
air
but
returned
to
the
living
room
of
the
hunting
lodge
just
as
he
reached
the
fireplace
mac
came
in
with
a
load
of
wood
this
is
the
last
of
it
he
announced
we
ll
have
to
cut
some
more
before
it
gets
dark
and
we
ll
have
to
hustle
to
it
because
it
is
getting
darker
all
the
time
we
re
in
for
a
we
ll
have
to
cut
some
wood
tim
told
him
but
i
made
a
great
discovery
mac
there
is
a
shed
joined
to
the
kitchen
and
it
is
half
filled
with
coal
that
means
an
end
to
our
it
doesn
t
belong
to
us
mac
interposed
practically
i
know
but
if
we
pay
for
what
we
use
it
ought
to
be
all
right
in
the
little
time
left
for
us
to
stay
here
we
won
t
use
much
come
on
and
look
at
he
led
his
brother
to
the
coal
shed
and
mac
inspected
it
i
suppose
it
will
be
all
right
the
twin
nodded
if
it
isn
t
barry
will
tell
us
when
he
gets
back
here
at
any
rate
we
can
use
it
to
warm
up
the
room
in
there
and
it
will
do
the
job
quicker
than
wood
will
let
s
take
a
bucket
of
it
in
the
this
coal
explains
why
they
use
grates
in
the
hall
and
the
living
room
tim
said
as
they
filled
a
coal
pail
that
hung
close
by
returning
to
the
living
room
of
the
lodge
they
quickly
built
the
fire
the
flames
licked
their
way
up
through
the
paper
and
over
the
wood
and
when
this
had
caught
fire
in
good
style
they
put
some
coal
on
as
the
fire
blazed
out
in
a
comforting
manner
the
brothers
stood
and
watched
it
with
satisfaction
the
first
fire
in
this
room
for
many
a
day
remarked
tim
mac
grinned
that
ghost
or
spook
must
be
a
fellow
prowling
around
here
in
rooms
as
cold
as
these
tim
glanced
out
of
the
window
mac
it
is
snowing
again
and
i
have
a
hunch
that
it
is
going
to
snow
hard
let
s
get
some
more
wood
in
before
things
close
i
guess
we
had
better
some
of
that
limb
over
at
the
cabin
is
left
and
we
can
get
our
supply
off
of
the
twins
took
their
axes
and
hastened
to
the
limb
before
the
cabin
falling
to
with
a
will
they
soon
had
the
wood
supply
mounting
the
storm
increased
as
they
worked
until
they
could
scarcely
see
for
the
whirling
flakes
for
some
time
they
were
silent
saving
their
energy
for
the
task
before
them
but
their
minds
were
on
the
same
subject
mac
leaned
on
his
ax
for
a
breathing
spell
i
m
afraid
that
the
boys
will
have
a
hard
time
finding
their
way
through
this
storm
he
said
tim
stopped
chopping
and
looked
anxiously
toward
the
forest
which
could
barely
be
seen
both
boys
had
a
goodly
quantity
of
snow
on
their
shoulders
and
hats
i
have
been
thinking
the
same
thing
he
admitted
you
can
hardly
see
the
woods
from
here
and
they
don
t
know
the
way
very
maybe
they
can
see
better
in
the
woods
than
we
can
out
here
in
the
open
said
mac
hopefully
he
began
to
chop
again
with
vigor
let
s
get
through
here
and
get
back
in
the
lodge
by
golly
we
can
hardly
see
anything
ourselves
and
we
might
get
lost
without
much
trouble
they
carried
their
wood
into
the
lodge
and
then
returned
to
the
cabin
for
a
final
load
of
their
camping
equipment
satisfied
that
they
now
had
everything
tim
locked
the
door
and
trotted
across
the
open
space
to
the
hunting
lodge
he
paused
at
the
door
for
a
final
look
at
the
white
world
about
him
and
an
anxious
frown
gathered
on
his
forehead
how
i
wish
kent
and
barry
were
back
here
i
don
t
see
how
they
can
possibly
find
their
way
in
a
storm
like
this
more
troubled
than
he
cared
to
admit
tim
joined
his
twin
before
the
fire
in
the
large
grate
might
as
well
take
off
our
coats
and
make
ourselves
at
home
hadn
t
we
he
asked
i
was
just
thinking
about
priming
that
pump
on
the
back
porch
i
m
tired
of
snow
so
am
i
but
i
m
afraid
that
pump
is
frozen
no
doubt
of
it
but
some
good
hot
water
poured
in
it
ought
to
break
it
loose
it
is
warmer
today
than
it
has
been
most
of
the
time
want
to
try
it
i
guess
so
how
will
we
heat
water
there
is
nothing
to
hang
a
kettle
mac
examined
the
fireplace
closely
no
there
isn
t
but
we
could
set
the
kettle
right
on
the
coals
wouldn
t
hurt
the
kettle
let
s
look
in
the
kitchen
and
see
what
we
can
find
there
tim
proposed
we
could
start
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
heat
our
water
i
guess
we
had
better
not
use
up
our
wood
on
a
kitchen
fire
mac
shook
his
head
for
tonight
we
can
get
along
with
this
grate
fire
we
don
t
know
how
long
this
storm
will
last
so
we
will
have
to
be
they
traversed
the
long
hall
to
the
kitchen
and
examined
the
pots
and
pans
that
hung
on
hooks
under
the
shelves
from
the
closet
beside
the
cook
range
mac
brought
out
a
curiously
shaped
pan
it
was
flat
on
one
side
and
had
a
long
handle
to
it
a
hook
curved
out
from
the
flat
side
and
there
was
a
hinged
cover
for
it
what
the
dickens
kind
of
a
pot
is
this
tim
i
never
saw
one
like
it
tim
looked
it
over
with
interest
hanged
if
i
know
he
began
then
suddenly
his
face
lighted
up
why
mac
this
must
be
a
pan
to
hang
on
the
grate
this
hook
goes
over
the
top
grate
bar
and
you
can
heat
water
in
it
just
the
thing
we
need
that
s
just
exactly
what
it
is
mac
nodded
i
ll
get
some
snow
and
we
can
melt
it
down
and
then
try
our
luck
on
that
they
filled
the
grate
pan
with
snow
and
then
took
it
in
and
hooked
it
on
the
top
bar
of
the
grate
there
was
now
no
doubt
in
their
minds
that
the
utensil
was
meant
for
its
present
use
while
that
is
melting
and
heating
let
s
get
the
lamps
in
here
tim
suggested
and
they
brought
the
oil
lamps
in
from
the
bedrooms
there
was
very
little
oil
left
in
them
and
the
boys
had
only
a
scanty
supply
in
their
lanterns
we
ll
have
plenty
when
barry
and
kent
get
here
mac
remarked
looking
out
at
the
storm
but
the
scene
that
met
his
eye
was
not
a
reassuring
one
if
anything
the
storm
was
increasing
that
snow
has
melted
down
and
will
soon
be
hot
water
tim
said
after
a
glance
into
the
grate
pan
guess
we
d
better
get
another
pan
of
snow
and
keep
melting
it
because
that
pump
will
have
to
be
primed
more
than
this
was
done
and
as
the
water
became
hot
the
boys
kept
adding
snow
at
last
the
pan
was
filled
with
boiling
water
and
they
poured
it
into
the
tea
kettle
and
after
refilling
the
grate
pan
with
snow
they
set
off
for
the
back
porch
to
try
their
luck
with
the
pump
tim
carefully
poured
the
boiling
fluid
down
the
neck
of
the
rusty
iron
pump
shaft
steam
arose
as
the
hot
water
came
in
contact
with
the
ice
if
we
do
get
this
thing
going
we
ll
have
to
prime
it
every
morning
mac
predicted
standing
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
and
moving
about
to
keep
warm
yes
no
doubt
of
that
gosh
it
is
getting
colder
good
thing
this
porch
shelters
us
from
some
of
the
they
poured
pan
after
pan
of
boiling
water
down
the
pump
shaft
without
attaining
the
end
they
were
seeking
and
were
about
to
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
when
mac
felt
the
pump
handle
move
with
a
sucking
sound
he
pressed
harder
i
think
she
s
coming
he
cried
put
another
dose
tim
did
so
and
the
water
came
pouring
up
bringing
with
it
a
mixture
of
ice
and
rust
flakes
the
brothers
worked
the
handle
vigorously
and
soon
a
stream
of
clear
water
flowed
out
hurrah
we
made
it
tim
exulted
thought
we
weren
t
going
to
so
did
i
that
water
looks
good
wait
until
i
get
a
glass
from
the
kitchen
and
we
can
have
a
good
drink
of
they
filled
some
pails
with
the
water
and
then
returned
to
the
house
darkness
was
beginning
to
settle
and
their
spirits
became
more
and
more
depressed
it
was
close
to
five
o
clock
and
the
blackness
of
night
soon
closed
entirely
over
the
lodge
tim
lighted
a
lamp
and
they
were
comfortable
as
far
as
light
and
warmth
were
concerned
but
their
minds
were
far
from
easy
no
use
talking
the
boys
have
either
stayed
at
fox
point
or
they
are
lost
mac
sighed
as
they
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
thick
blackness
i
don
t
believe
they
stayed
tim
shook
his
head
i
m
afraid
that
they
started
on
the
return
trip
and
got
caught
the
tough
part
is
that
if
we
go
out
to
look
for
them
we
would
probably
be
lost
in
a
short
time
too
chapter
xv
mysterious
knocking
for
a
moment
after
tim
s
discouraging
words
the
twins
stood
and
stared
helplessly
out
at
the
darkness
of
the
night
from
every
angle
the
situation
was
a
serious
one
if
the
country
had
been
familiar
to
them
they
would
have
attempted
to
go
out
and
look
for
barry
and
kent
but
they
had
only
a
sketchy
notion
of
the
hills
and
valleys
the
wind
was
blowing
the
snow
around
in
such
a
way
that
even
the
stoutest
woodsmen
might
have
been
confused
and
lost
on
such
a
day
to
the
ford
boys
it
seemed
anything
but
cheering
that
their
chums
were
somewhere
abroad
in
the
storm
and
darkness
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
mac
confessed
after
they
had
stared
out
into
the
night
for
some
time
tim
turned
from
the
window
and
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
the
first
thing
we
had
better
do
is
to
get
our
things
off
he
recommended
it
is
getting
mighty
warm
in
here
now
then
we
had
better
get
supper
ready
they
might
come
in
yet
mac
maybe
we
re
only
borrowing
it
may
be
his
brother
agreed
brightening
up
they
may
have
waited
at
fox
point
until
it
blew
over
and
will
be
here
later
but
if
this
keeps
up
they
ll
have
to
come
here
on
yes
it
is
getting
deep
well
what
shall
we
do
about
supper
we
aren
t
going
to
build
a
kitchen
fire
and
we
won
t
eat
in
that
big
dining
no
we
can
make
this
room
our
headquarters
for
about
everything
mac
nodded
let
s
bring
in
that
table
from
the
kitchen
and
set
it
right
here
by
the
fire
it
will
just
fit
our
willing
to
occupy
their
minds
with
something
besides
worry
the
two
boys
went
to
the
kitchen
and
carried
out
the
small
table
that
mac
had
spoken
about
it
was
just
large
enough
for
the
four
of
them
and
they
found
clean
knives
and
forks
in
the
drawer
but
tim
washed
them
for
the
sake
of
safety
after
this
was
done
he
put
them
around
the
table
i
ll
set
four
places
he
said
mac
glanced
at
the
clock
and
noted
that
it
was
close
to
six
sure
set
four
places
they
ll
be
along
soon
he
said
but
his
voice
lacked
conviction
and
both
of
them
were
more
alarmed
than
they
would
care
to
admit
what
shall
we
have
for
supper
tim
inquired
beginning
to
dig
among
the
stores
that
they
had
brought
over
from
the
cabin
i
was
hoping
to
have
sausage
mac
smiled
but
i
guess
we
had
better
not
count
on
it
open
a
can
of
pork
and
beans
i
ll
fix
the
for
a
while
they
worked
silently
the
fire
was
a
mass
of
glowing
red
coals
and
the
room
was
lighted
by
one
lamp
they
could
see
well
enough
by
this
light
and
did
not
intend
to
light
another
one
because
they
thought
it
best
to
save
for
an
emergency
tim
put
the
beans
on
to
warm
and
mac
made
coffee
while
these
things
were
coming
along
the
brothers
sat
on
the
wicker
couch
and
stared
into
the
fire
i
hope
the
other
boys
aren
t
cold
while
we
are
enjoying
this
fine
fire
mac
murmured
they
may
be
around
the
stove
at
fox
point
tim
hoped
sure
on
the
other
hand
we
can
t
help
but
realize
that
they
may
be
out
in
the
woods
wandering
around
hang
it
all
i
hate
waiting
worse
than
anything
else
on
earth
tim
sprang
up
and
went
to
the
window
peering
out
so
do
i
the
storm
is
pretty
bad
and
we
had
better
not
get
away
from
the
lodge
listen
to
that
old
wind
mac
couldn
t
help
listening
to
it
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
it
tore
around
the
lodge
and
made
some
of
the
windows
rattle
the
fire
in
the
grate
was
vigorous
and
glowing
because
of
it
already
the
coffee
was
bubbling
and
a
tempting
odor
came
from
the
pot
on
the
coals
had
the
other
boys
been
there
with
them
they
would
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
all
but
just
now
its
attraction
was
lost
in
the
air
of
uncertainty
that
surrounded
them
i
think
we
moved
out
of
the
cabin
just
in
time
he
said
that
little
old
place
is
something
of
an
antique
and
it
was
colder
than
it
should
have
been
i
ll
bet
the
wind
is
coming
in
under
the
door
over
tim
nodded
looking
around
the
room
they
were
in
yes
this
surely
is
a
great
improvement
wicker
couch
and
chairs
window
seats
and
bookcases
how
shall
we
sleep
tonight
in
the
bedrooms
i
don
t
think
so
too
cold
this
couch
will
be
good
for
one
of
us
to
sleep
on
and
if
we
lug
the
mattresses
in
here
we
can
make
dandy
beds
i
have
an
idea
that
the
sheets
and
everything
else
in
those
rooms
would
be
as
cold
as
tim
took
the
pan
of
beans
off
of
the
fire
these
are
ready
and
the
boys
aren
t
here
yet
though
it
is
after
six
want
to
eat
mac
shook
his
head
not
yet
let
s
wait
awhile
we
can
heat
them
up
again
when
they
come
i
ll
go
get
some
more
he
put
his
coat
and
hat
on
and
took
the
coal
pail
tim
silently
handed
him
the
flashlight
mac
went
out
the
door
and
down
the
hall
while
tim
stared
into
the
fire
mac
did
not
stay
out
long
and
when
he
got
back
he
rubbed
his
hands
man
alive
but
it
is
cold
say
the
boys
have
no
lantern
with
them
have
they
no
only
a
they
couldn
t
keep
a
lantern
going
anyway
on
a
windy
night
like
silence
again
fell
between
them
and
at
last
it
was
seven
o
clock
tim
looked
around
the
room
and
then
got
up
they
had
put
the
lamp
out
and
had
been
sitting
in
the
light
of
the
fire
mac
they
aren
t
coming
so
you
and
i
had
better
eat
something
i
know
you
don
t
feel
much
like
eating
and
neither
do
i
but
it
will
do
us
good
to
pack
something
solid
away
inside
of
i
never
felt
less
like
eating
growled
mac
i
know
it
i
realize
just
now
how
you
feel
but
we
might
need
our
strength
later
on
and
we
can
do
more
for
the
boys
on
a
full
stomach
than
we
ever
could
on
an
empty
you
re
right
his
brother
nodded
if
we
only
knew
something
it
is
the
uncertainty
that
makes
it
all
so
once
more
they
warmed
the
beans
and
coffee
and
when
the
food
had
been
placed
on
their
plates
and
the
beverage
in
the
cups
they
began
to
eat
it
was
a
hasty
and
a
silent
meal
for
they
were
oppressed
and
neither
of
them
possessed
any
appetite
to
speak
of
the
two
empty
places
at
the
table
haunted
them
and
they
found
it
hard
to
keep
various
alarming
thoughts
out
of
their
heads
i
think
we
ought
to
light
a
lamp
and
put
it
in
the
window
as
a
guide
for
them
mac
proposed
when
they
had
finished
their
meal
sure
thing
tim
agreed
they
may
come
along
late
and
any
kind
of
a
light
will
be
a
help
to
them
we
haven
t
got
much
oil
but
we
ll
use
all
that
we
have
in
a
lamp
for
mac
picked
up
a
taboret
and
put
it
on
the
window
seat
put
the
lamp
on
top
of
that
he
directed
that
ought
to
shine
for
quite
a
distance
if
the
oil
runs
out
we
can
go
until
daylight
without
any
we
ll
get
enough
coal
in
here
to
last
all
night
and
we
won
t
have
to
build
a
new
fire
in
the
morning
if
they
haven
t
come
in
by
that
time
we
ll
have
to
go
after
them
storm
or
no
tim
placed
the
lighted
lamp
on
the
taboret
and
the
boys
felt
that
they
had
done
all
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
mac
sat
on
the
couch
in
a
reclining
position
and
his
brother
squinted
at
the
titles
on
the
backs
of
the
books
in
the
bookcase
i
ll
try
a
little
reading
he
announced
don
t
know
how
successful
it
will
mac
yawned
and
slid
a
little
lower
i
m
too
tired
and
worried
to
read
he
said
better
not
get
hold
of
a
spook
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
idea
tim
replied
i
need
something
exciting
to
keep
me
awake
and
take
my
mind
off
of
he
finally
found
a
book
that
suited
him
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
the
lamp
on
the
taboret
he
started
to
read
mac
sank
lower
on
the
couch
and
soon
fell
asleep
tim
read
on
it
was
a
little
colder
over
near
the
lamp
than
he
wished
for
but
he
didn
t
want
to
take
the
lamp
away
from
the
window
a
sudden
clear
tapping
on
the
window
back
of
him
caused
tim
to
start
violently
and
almost
drop
his
book
it
came
on
the
glass
of
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
not
where
the
light
was
tim
jumped
up
joyously
sure
that
the
boys
had
returned
hey
mac
wake
up
the
boys
are
here
mac
bounded
to
his
feet
they
are
where
tim
was
at
the
dark
window
peering
out
they
just
knocked
here
i
can
t
see
them
but
they
just
tapped
on
the
glass
while
i
was
reading
almost
they
are
at
the
back
door
mac
whooped
seizing
his
flashlight
come
on
we
re
the
committee
of
we
ll
surely
welcome
them
tim
agreed
as
they
made
their
way
along
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
mac
quickly
turned
the
key
in
that
door
and
drew
back
the
knob
the
door
opened
but
no
one
was
there
the
boys
looked
around
the
porch
and
flashed
the
light
into
every
corner
but
without
success
i
was
sure
that
knocking
came
from
the
back
door
tim
exclaimed
when
they
failed
to
find
anyone
so
was
i
maybe
they
are
trying
to
put
something
over
on
maybe
admitted
tim
doubtfully
but
i
should
think
they
would
have
had
enough
of
being
out
in
the
cold
well
they
aren
t
here
we
had
better
go
in
your
flashlight
is
getting
it
s
about
mac
locked
the
door
and
they
walked
slowly
down
the
hall
toward
the
living
room
it
had
just
occurred
to
them
that
they
were
in
what
was
known
as
a
haunted
lodge
and
various
thoughts
were
crowding
into
their
minds
in
the
living
room
they
looked
uncertainly
at
each
other
i
doubt
if
the
boys
would
play
any
such
foolish
stunts
tim
remarked
i
doubt
it
too
of
course
it
s
a
good
opportunity
to
have
a
little
fun
listen
tim
cried
holding
up
his
hand
there
were
three
distinct
thumps
on
the
side
of
the
lodge
and
then
all
was
quiet
then
a
loud
and
insistent
knocking
came
on
the
front
door
the
twins
looked
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
then
tim
took
the
lamp
and
they
started
for
the
front
door
mac
took
up
the
poker
as
they
passed
the
fireplace
i
ll
open
the
door
he
said
and
while
tim
held
the
lamp
he
turned
the
key
and
pulled
the
knob
the
door
came
open
with
a
rush
and
the
wind
snuffed
the
lamp
flame
out
in
a
twinkling
and
yet
not
so
quickly
that
the
ford
twins
could
make
out
the
fact
that
there
was
no
one
near
the
front
door
chapter
xvi
the
quarry
shed
barry
and
kent
stood
in
the
woods
and
gazed
with
sinking
hearts
at
the
ledge
of
rock
before
them
it
told
them
in
unmistakable
terms
that
they
were
lost
and
as
barry
had
truly
said
at
a
very
serious
time
after
all
of
their
recent
pushing
on
they
were
right
back
at
the
place
where
they
had
been
a
short
time
before
i
wonder
how
we
came
to
go
around
like
that
kent
asked
as
he
brushed
snow
from
the
front
of
his
coat
and
tried
to
see
around
him
easy
to
do
in
a
blinding
storm
like
this
one
barry
replied
well
we
re
into
it
for
fair
shall
we
try
it
again
or
turn
back
to
fox
point
i
don
t
want
to
turn
back
kent
protested
mac
and
tim
will
be
badly
worried
and
i
d
like
to
make
it
through
if
we
possibly
can
which
way
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
i
thought
we
were
going
right
and
yet
we
came
around
in
a
circle
trouble
is
it
is
getting
so
confounded
dark
want
to
try
going
on
again
yes
and
we
ll
go
more
west
than
we
have
been
going
we
can
t
stand
here
and
they
started
forward
once
more
striking
out
in
a
new
direction
which
seemed
to
both
of
them
to
be
the
right
way
the
wind
was
searching
and
they
lowered
their
heads
both
to
keep
their
faces
out
of
the
cutting
blast
and
to
shelter
their
eyes
from
the
driving
snow
the
sled
dragging
along
back
of
them
made
slow
progress
through
the
mounting
snow
and
it
caught
frequently
on
the
snags
and
bushes
from
time
to
time
they
changed
and
took
turns
pulling
it
but
after
a
time
barry
halted
and
came
close
to
his
chum
whom
he
could
scarcely
see
in
the
gloom
i
think
we
ought
to
leave
the
sled
he
shouted
kent
nodded
knocking
snow
off
of
his
collar
i
have
been
thinking
that
too
he
returned
we
can
t
make
any
progress
with
we
ll
put
it
somewhere
near
a
landmark
so
that
we
will
be
able
to
find
it
again
barry
proposed
trying
to
look
around
after
the
storm
we
can
come
back
and
locate
if
we
ever
do
come
back
alive
said
kent
barry
slapped
him
on
the
back
we
ll
come
back
all
right
we
re
only
temporarily
bewildered
in
a
snowstorm
let
s
find
a
place
to
leave
the
kent
took
his
flashlight
off
the
hook
on
his
belt
and
flashed
it
around
the
light
of
it
revealed
falling
flakes
and
an
depth
of
snow
on
the
ground
advancing
a
few
yards
they
came
to
a
tall
shaft
of
rock
and
earth
that
formed
a
shelter
from
the
driving
power
of
the
new
england
storm
it
was
with
relief
that
they
got
out
of
the
direct
path
of
the
wind
here
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
barry
proclaimed
pulling
the
sled
in
close
to
the
foot
of
the
small
bluff
we
may
have
a
hard
time
finding
the
spot
but
at
least
we
know
the
sled
will
be
under
an
overhang
of
dirt
and
stone
this
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
place
in
which
to
spend
the
night
if
we
had
i
hate
the
thought
of
staying
out
in
this
cold
all
night
kent
shook
his
head
so
do
i
seems
like
my
skin
is
pinched
hard
i
wonder
if
we
can
t
start
a
fire
going
here
and
eat
something
kent
again
flashed
the
light
around
it
will
be
a
hard
job
but
it
will
be
worth
trying
i
think
we
can
get
some
dry
wood
out
of
that
log
over
there
as
long
as
we
have
the
sled
with
us
we
ought
to
use
the
food
on
you
re
right
we
haven
t
anything
to
make
coffee
in
and
about
the
only
food
we
can
eat
is
the
steak
we
bought
we
can
spear
that
on
a
stick
and
cook
it
let
s
try
almost
feeling
their
way
they
began
to
chop
into
the
wet
log
with
the
camp
axes
which
they
carried
at
their
belts
the
top
wood
was
soft
and
pulpy
and
even
that
which
they
hacked
out
of
the
heart
of
the
log
was
not
very
dry
after
the
most
tiresome
efforts
they
succeeded
in
getting
a
pile
of
questionable
wood
together
and
then
came
the
task
of
setting
it
afire
both
of
them
huddled
close
to
the
pile
and
jealously
guarded
the
tiny
flame
of
the
matches
as
they
attempted
to
ignite
the
sticks
and
bits
of
wood
six
matches
were
soon
wasted
this
looks
hopeless
barry
sighed
even
the
good
store
paper
won
t
kent
jumped
up
what
dummies
we
are
this
storm
has
us
buffaloed
we
have
two
long
containers
of
kerosene
oil
on
the
sled
oh
good
night
exclaimed
barry
in
disgust
of
course
we
have
douse
this
wood
with
it
and
then
we
won
t
have
any
trouble
starting
our
unscrewing
the
top
of
a
container
kent
poured
some
of
the
oil
on
the
wood
and
then
replaced
the
oil
can
on
the
sled
this
time
they
had
no
difficulty
and
when
the
match
flame
touched
the
wood
the
fire
ran
rapidly
from
chip
to
chip
until
all
were
blazing
the
cold
and
hungry
boys
stooped
low
and
held
out
grateful
hands
to
the
flame
doesn
t
a
fire
feel
good
kent
exulted
doesn
t
it
his
companion
echoed
he
straightened
up
and
began
to
search
under
the
sled
canvas
for
the
steak
which
they
had
purchased
at
fox
point
we
ll
have
to
get
at
our
cooking
right
away
because
when
the
oil
burns
off
this
wood
is
going
to
be
poor
material
especially
when
we
add
more
to
you
re
right
about
that
kent
acknowledged
i
ll
cut
a
couple
of
sharp
sticks
to
cook
the
steak
he
took
out
his
hunting
knife
and
hacked
at
some
bushes
that
showed
dimly
in
the
shadows
from
the
fire
before
long
he
had
procured
two
fine
shafts
and
then
he
proceeded
to
sharpen
a
point
on
each
one
in
the
meantime
barry
cut
the
steak
in
two
and
then
cut
it
again
maybe
some
of
those
things
on
the
sled
ought
to
go
with
us
when
we
leave
here
he
observed
as
he
thrust
the
pointed
stick
through
the
steak
we
don
t
know
how
long
we
may
be
on
the
march
and
we
ll
want
food
with
too
bad
we
haven
t
got
a
knapsack
along
kent
declared
it
is
but
we
have
some
good
pockets
that
will
take
a
few
things
once
this
storm
clears
we
ll
be
able
to
see
something
unfortunately
we
don
t
know
when
it
will
let
they
became
silent
holding
the
portions
of
steak
over
the
blaze
and
soon
the
meat
was
browning
and
the
juice
dripping
into
the
fire
as
barry
had
said
the
quality
of
the
blaze
soon
became
poor
and
when
fresh
fuel
was
added
it
was
uncertain
and
smoky
but
they
managed
to
eat
their
steak
and
it
went
a
long
way
toward
giving
them
a
better
feeling
i
missed
salt
and
bread
with
it
kent
smiled
as
they
finished
the
steak
but
it
certainly
was
good
all
by
itself
well
what
shall
we
do
i
believe
that
we
ought
to
go
on
this
fire
doesn
t
amount
to
anything
and
there
is
no
use
hanging
around
here
all
night
we
don
t
want
to
use
up
our
oil
on
the
fire
and
we
would
have
to
work
all
night
to
cut
wood
for
then
let
s
tie
the
canvas
down
tight
over
the
sled
and
cover
it
up
with
some
branches
so
that
no
wandering
animal
can
get
into
it
kent
proposed
and
they
spent
some
time
in
doing
this
when
this
task
had
been
attended
to
they
set
out
once
more
heading
into
the
dashing
flakes
once
more
the
twins
will
be
badly
worried
barry
said
as
they
stumbled
along
making
better
time
now
that
they
were
no
longer
held
back
by
the
burden
of
the
sled
yes
they
will
i
hope
they
won
t
come
out
and
try
to
find
i
doubt
that
they
will
they
can
see
how
bad
the
storm
is
and
that
they
would
be
lost
in
no
time
at
all
boy
that
flashlight
of
yours
is
a
there
was
no
question
that
the
flashlight
was
tremendously
valuable
kent
used
it
sparingly
and
turned
it
on
only
at
intervals
but
it
guided
them
on
their
journey
they
kept
on
going
and
at
last
were
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
as
they
had
passed
no
home
and
even
the
country
did
not
look
familiar
to
them
at
last
barry
halted
and
looked
around
flash
your
light
up
he
directed
where
are
we
kent
played
the
light
around
him
and
they
saw
that
they
were
in
an
old
quarry
the
rock
walls
gleamed
in
the
faint
light
of
the
flash
a
quarry
barry
cried
kent
played
the
light
down
toward
the
ground
and
they
saw
a
small
shed
there
is
shelter
if
we
need
it
he
began
at
that
moment
the
flashlight
slipped
out
of
his
hand
and
fell
into
the
snow
doggone
it
he
grumbled
i
dropped
the
both
of
them
stooped
to
search
for
it
and
then
paused
as
they
heard
a
sound
near
them
someone
was
approaching
and
they
felt
a
great
relief
as
they
realized
it
neither
of
them
spoke
and
a
moment
later
a
light
flashed
out
evidently
from
a
flashlight
the
beam
rested
on
the
shed
and
the
boys
waited
to
see
the
face
or
form
of
the
one
who
held
it
but
they
were
destined
to
be
disappointed
a
hand
came
into
the
center
of
light
and
turned
the
knob
on
the
shed
door
the
hand
was
sheltered
in
a
black
glove
and
that
was
all
that
they
saw
of
the
person
who
opened
the
door
of
the
quarry
shed
the
light
was
instantly
extinguished
and
the
door
slammed
shut
they
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
wonder
who
that
was
kent
asked
he
had
found
the
flashlight
and
they
both
stood
up
and
tried
to
see
things
more
clearly
i
don
t
know
funny
he
didn
t
hear
us
or
see
our
the
wind
is
too
loud
for
him
to
have
heard
us
seems
as
though
he
should
have
seen
our
light
going
to
ask
for
some
help
of
course
we
don
t
know
our
way
and
we
need
to
have
someone
tell
us
we
ll
knock
on
the
approaching
the
small
quarry
shed
barry
knocked
on
the
door
and
they
waited
the
wind
still
blew
strongly
and
the
flakes
drifted
down
into
the
abandoned
quarry
no
answer
came
to
their
summons
and
barry
tried
again
they
listened
with
growing
impatience
it
s
a
wonder
he
wouldn
t
open
the
door
or
at
least
call
out
kent
growled
barry
took
kent
s
flashlight
and
flashed
the
beam
around
the
shed
was
backed
up
against
a
dirt
section
of
the
quarry
wall
and
the
windows
were
boarded
up
it
was
impossible
to
look
into
the
little
shelter
he
walked
around
on
the
far
side
and
found
that
conditions
there
were
the
same
then
they
once
more
stood
before
the
door
and
listened
barry
kicked
the
door
is
anybody
here
he
shouted
we
re
two
boys
that
have
lost
our
way
and
we
want
to
ask
the
only
answer
was
a
profound
stillness
from
the
inside
of
the
quarry
shed
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
and
angry
thoughts
leaped
into
their
minds
they
had
been
adrift
in
the
cold
and
storm
so
long
that
this
lack
of
common
humanity
on
the
part
of
the
man
whom
they
had
seen
enter
the
shed
aroused
them
he
s
hiding
in
there
and
won
t
answer
kent
cried
we
ought
to
kick
the
door
in
i
d
like
to
know
what
he
s
hiding
for
barry
said
he
must
have
some
reason
for
not
wanting
to
talk
to
chapter
xvii
the
black
shadow
losing
his
temper
for
the
moment
kent
launched
two
heavy
kicks
against
the
door
of
the
quarry
shed
the
sound
boomed
out
across
the
big
cleared
space
and
the
boys
listened
expectantly
hoping
that
this
vigorous
summons
would
bring
results
but
no
answer
came
to
them
let
s
break
in
kent
proposed
we
can
t
freeze
to
death
out
in
the
open
and
besides
that
i
d
like
to
tell
that
man
inside
what
i
think
of
him
we
can
crash
that
door
for
a
moment
barry
was
swayed
by
the
idea
it
seemed
to
them
as
though
they
had
been
cold
and
lost
for
ages
and
the
prospect
of
warmth
and
shelter
from
the
driving
wind
was
alluring
but
as
he
considered
it
he
shook
his
head
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
kent
for
some
reason
that
we
don
t
know
whoever
went
into
the
shed
is
hiding
that
shows
he
is
up
to
no
good
such
a
person
may
have
a
gun
on
him
and
if
we
break
in
we
may
get
i
suppose
you
re
right
but
i
do
want
to
have
a
few
words
with
that
fellow
no
matter
who
he
is
or
what
he
is
up
to
he
could
at
least
shout
out
directions
what
are
we
going
to
do
wait
awhile
until
he
comes
sneaking
out
we
could
do
that
we
could
hide
and
watch
the
place
and
then
go
into
it
when
he
comes
out
but
look
here
isn
t
this
quarry
familiar
to
you
isn
t
it
the
one
we
can
see
from
the
lodge
kent
looked
around
impatiently
brushing
the
snow
from
his
collar
i
don
t
know
all
quarries
look
the
same
especially
in
a
i
know
it
but
how
many
quarries
are
there
near
the
lodge
only
one
that
i
know
of
and
we
can
see
that
one
from
the
if
that
is
true
said
kent
thoughtfully
we
have
just
wandered
around
in
a
big
circle
and
come
around
in
back
of
the
lodge
instead
of
approaching
it
from
the
side
by
golly
we
may
be
almost
home
i
wouldn
t
be
barry
pointed
through
a
gap
formed
by
the
quarry
and
the
dark
trees
of
the
forest
the
lodge
would
be
in
that
direction
wouldn
t
it
i
think
so
shall
we
hike
that
way
yes
let
s
go
no
use
standing
around
but
suppose
we
re
wrong
we
ought
to
try
and
get
back
here
and
break
into
this
little
building
we
might
wander
until
we
re
exhausted
drop
and
then
freeze
more
than
one
hunter
has
done
that
you
if
we
find
we
re
wrong
we
ll
try
and
make
our
way
back
here
barry
said
but
i
just
have
a
hunch
that
the
lodge
lies
in
that
direction
we
ll
try
spurred
on
by
the
faint
hope
that
they
might
be
somewhere
near
their
camp
the
boys
hurried
out
of
the
bowl
of
the
quarry
and
once
more
plunged
into
the
woods
they
found
that
their
feet
had
become
numb
from
standing
and
they
winced
as
they
began
their
journey
the
wind
was
still
sharp
but
the
snowflakes
had
thinned
out
and
the
storm
was
obviously
letting
up
there
had
been
considerable
snow
however
and
their
feet
sank
deep
into
it
as
they
traveled
on
i
believe
that
the
storm
is
letting
up
barry
said
as
they
tramped
on
heads
down
and
faces
bent
to
escape
the
bite
of
the
wind
that
will
be
a
help
kent
acknowledged
but
isn
t
this
cold
intense
i
d
give
something
to
be
out
of
this
wind
and
to
get
my
feet
warm
i
don
t
want
to
kick
a
rock
or
a
tree
root
for
fear
of
knocking
a
couple
of
toes
off
when
we
get
up
to
the
top
of
this
slope
we
may
be
able
to
see
our
way
and
figure
out
where
we
are
barry
consoled
we
ve
had
mighty
bad
luck
kent
said
we
haven
t
come
across
a
single
home
and
there
are
some
in
these
mountains
but
our
wanderings
have
taken
us
away
from
yes
if
we
had
run
across
a
house
we
could
have
put
up
for
the
night
we
may
do
so
yet
well
in
a
few
minutes
we
can
see
toiling
on
up
the
slope
they
came
at
last
to
a
break
in
the
timber
and
their
anxious
eyes
scanned
the
dark
landscape
for
any
signs
that
might
guide
them
then
barry
pointed
i
wonder
if
that
is
a
light
off
there
it
s
pretty
small
and
still
some
distance
away
what
do
you
think
looks
like
a
light
to
me
we
might
as
well
go
in
that
direction
and
see
it
is
as
good
as
walking
around
they
set
off
at
a
faster
pace
and
soon
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
light
of
some
kind
was
before
them
the
confirmation
of
their
hope
caused
their
spirits
to
rise
rapidly
it
is
either
our
camp
or
some
house
barry
said
as
he
walked
on
with
a
new
vigor
in
his
stride
whichever
it
is
it
means
warmth
for
i
hope
it
is
the
camp
but
if
it
isn
t
a
house
will
be
all
right
observed
kent
unless
the
people
there
are
like
the
man
who
hid
in
the
quarry
we
won
t
find
many
like
that
thank
goodness
barry
remarked
for
a
short
distance
they
lost
sight
of
the
light
as
they
crossed
a
low
section
of
ground
where
many
bushes
grew
and
then
when
they
once
more
came
out
on
high
ground
a
joyous
shout
burst
from
kent
it
is
the
lodge
he
shouted
hurrah
we
re
located
at
last
see
the
old
cabin
over
there
beside
it
yes
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
agreed
barry
thankfully
boy
does
that
place
look
good
to
me
before
long
we
ll
be
hugging
the
fire
we
ll
give
it
a
big
bear
hug
kent
promised
gosh
i
am
glad
to
be
back
safely
things
looked
black
for
us
for
a
they
certainly
did
barry
agreed
soberly
too
bad
we
didn
t
bring
the
sled
on
with
us
but
we
just
didn
t
it
s
all
right
kent
assured
him
with
this
depth
of
snow
on
the
ground
it
was
hard
to
pull
the
sled
and
we
have
made
better
time
without
it
i
believe
we
can
find
our
way
back
to
the
place
where
we
left
so
do
we
ve
got
to
get
mac
s
sausage
for
him
to
say
nothing
of
our
oil
and
the
other
things
on
the
their
spirits
were
climbing
with
every
step
and
now
that
the
cold
adventure
was
about
over
with
they
felt
strength
and
confidence
returning
with
the
knowledge
that
they
would
soon
be
reunited
with
the
boys
in
the
lodge
they
were
beginning
to
forget
the
suffering
and
anxiety
of
their
wandering
in
the
storm
they
approached
the
lodge
from
the
timber
that
grew
close
to
the
back
of
it
and
as
they
drew
nearer
they
heard
three
loud
thumps
the
boys
must
be
nailing
something
on
the
walls
barry
remarked
i
m
glad
they
left
that
lamp
in
the
window
kent
observed
it
has
been
a
for
here
comes
one
of
them
around
the
house
barry
exclaimed
i
wonder
what
he
is
doing
the
returning
travelers
were
just
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
crossing
the
open
space
to
the
lodge
when
the
appearance
of
someone
from
the
porch
stopped
them
a
figure
in
black
raced
along
the
side
of
the
lodge
and
crouched
near
the
window
where
the
lamp
stood
at
the
same
time
the
lamp
was
taken
away
and
the
boys
in
the
woods
saw
tim
s
face
briefly
through
the
window
say
that
s
not
tim
or
mac
barry
cried
in
a
low
tone
as
they
stood
and
looked
at
the
black
shadow
stooping
beneath
the
window
the
boys
are
in
the
house
something
is
going
on
here
something
funny
too
kent
quivered
want
to
tackle
that
fellow
by
the
window
before
barry
could
answer
the
black
shadow
straightened
up
and
ran
to
the
back
of
the
lodge
disappearing
in
the
tool
house
the
man
seemed
to
have
a
long
overcoat
on
and
he
was
a
weird
sight
as
he
fled
with
long
loping
strides
to
the
tool
house
barry
grasped
kent
s
arm
kent
that
s
the
spook
of
this
lodge
sure
thing
his
companion
breathed
we
ve
got
to
get
him
listen
proposed
barry
rapidly
you
sprint
for
the
lodge
and
get
the
twins
bring
the
guns
with
you
i
m
going
to
watch
that
tool
house
so
that
the
man
doesn
t
get
out
and
give
us
the
slip
step
to
it
kent
needed
no
urging
he
was
a
little
too
stiff
to
run
well
but
he
did
the
best
he
knew
how
and
covered
the
distance
from
the
woods
to
the
lodge
in
fairly
good
time
the
porch
creaked
as
he
ran
across
it
and
he
threw
open
the
front
door
without
ceremony
then
he
received
a
surprise
as
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
twins
they
were
standing
in
the
cold
hall
and
tim
held
the
lamp
which
mac
had
just
lighted
the
poker
was
on
the
floor
at
mac
s
feet
and
they
turned
with
startled
faces
as
kent
dashed
in
at
the
door
then
tim
s
face
darkened
with
anger
oh
it
was
you
fellows
after
all
he
began
with
some
heat
but
kent
interrupted
him
it
was
like
fun
there
is
a
man
hiding
in
the
tool
house
we
saw
him
run
around
the
lodge
get
the
rifles
and
come
on
barry
is
watching
the
tool
shed
the
twins
lost
no
time
mac
forgot
about
the
poker
and
ran
into
the
living
room
returning
with
the
rifles
and
his
hat
and
tim
s
how
about
the
lamp
tim
asked
as
he
seized
his
hat
leave
it
here
kent
returned
curtly
i
have
my
flashlight
come
on
they
raced
across
the
front
porch
and
jumped
into
the
snow
the
twins
shivering
with
cold
as
they
came
in
contact
with
the
outside
air
barry
had
moved
in
from
the
timber
and
was
standing
near
the
back
porch
mac
tossed
him
his
rifle
which
he
caught
on
the
run
tim
had
taken
the
poker
and
kent
had
his
rifle
mac
alone
was
not
armed
but
kent
passed
the
flashlight
to
him
he
s
still
in
there
barry
told
them
as
they
stopped
outside
the
door
i
haven
t
taken
my
eyes
off
of
the
place
since
you
left
and
he
hasn
t
come
out
turn
on
the
light
whoever
has
mac
pressed
the
button
and
the
beam
of
light
showed
the
door
barry
wasted
no
time
in
summoning
the
one
who
was
inside
with
his
rifle
held
forward
he
pushed
the
door
of
the
tool
house
kent
was
close
to
him
and
tim
brought
up
in
the
rear
they
were
all
excited
and
a
trifle
scared
but
the
general
feeling
was
that
the
black
shadow
should
be
captured
at
once
under
barry
s
push
the
door
yielded
slightly
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
not
locked
he
gave
it
a
stronger
push
and
it
rushed
back
against
the
wall
with
a
crash
the
light
from
the
flash
swept
into
the
shed
their
nerves
were
tense
and
eyes
strained
as
they
looked
about
the
tool
house
and
it
was
barry
who
voiced
the
conviction
of
all
of
them
he
got
away
there
s
no
one
in
the
place
chapter
xviii
down
river
the
mystery
hunters
were
astonished
and
baffled
as
they
gazed
into
the
interior
of
the
tool
shed
of
the
haunted
lodge
no
one
was
in
the
place
the
garden
tools
hung
in
order
a
large
bale
of
hay
stood
back
against
the
wall
but
no
human
being
was
to
be
seen
nor
was
there
anywhere
to
hide
mac
turned
the
beam
of
the
light
upward
there
was
no
loft
only
some
cross
braces
of
wood
that
would
not
hide
even
a
cat
but
we
saw
him
come
in
here
kent
protested
as
they
stood
and
looked
around
and
i
never
took
my
eyes
off
of
the
shed
barry
added
i
ran
across
from
the
woods
and
didn
t
even
watch
my
footing
because
i
wanted
to
keep
my
eyes
on
the
place
i
can
t
figure
it
tim
pointed
to
a
small
window
in
the
rear
maybe
he
slipped
through
barry
crossed
the
floor
of
the
tool
house
and
tried
the
window
it
was
not
locked
and
it
lifted
inward
well
he
might
have
though
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
have
seen
it
at
the
time
looks
as
though
that
was
his
only
way
perhaps
he
heard
or
saw
me
running
across
to
the
back
porch
and
he
slipped
out
of
the
window
as
we
were
approaching
the
front
too
bad
but
he
is
i
m
convinced
that
it
was
our
spook
too
mac
said
let
s
take
a
look
around
back
and
see
if
we
can
find
any
footprints
proposed
kent
and
going
to
the
back
of
the
tool
shed
they
looked
around
but
a
mass
of
briar
bushes
grew
close
to
the
rear
of
the
small
building
and
they
were
unable
to
find
any
clues
nothing
doing
barry
sighed
he
has
given
us
the
let
s
get
inside
suggested
tim
who
was
feeling
the
cold
intensely
yes
you
fellows
aren
t
dressed
for
outdoors
nodded
kent
and
we
are
just
about
crazy
to
get
in
around
the
fire
we
ll
have
to
give
this
up
as
a
bad
job
for
the
time
being
with
some
reluctance
they
left
the
vicinity
of
the
tool
house
and
made
their
way
around
to
the
front
of
the
hunting
lodge
the
boys
had
left
the
front
door
open
in
their
haste
and
the
hall
was
even
colder
than
it
had
been
the
twins
led
the
way
into
the
living
room
of
the
lodge
welcome
to
bluff
lodge
mac
cried
taking
the
poker
and
beginning
to
stir
the
fire
barry
and
kent
spread
grateful
hands
toward
the
blaze
coal
on
the
fire
barry
exclaimed
where
did
that
come
from
there
is
a
coal
shed
back
of
the
kitchen
tim
explained
feels
good
doesn
t
it
does
it
kent
and
barry
ejaculated
in
chorus
you
don
t
know
the
half
of
it
been
out
in
the
woods
in
all
this
storm
mac
asked
barry
nodded
yes
we
have
been
lost
had
to
leave
the
sled
and
find
our
way
it
was
a
great
idea
on
the
part
of
you
fellows
to
put
the
lamp
in
the
have
you
had
any
supper
tim
asked
yes
we
had
plenty
built
a
fire
and
cooked
some
steak
kent
told
him
but
i
d
surely
appreciate
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
how
about
you
barry
yes
indeed
his
chum
agreed
he
began
to
take
off
his
outer
clothes
shaking
snow
into
the
fireplace
we
ve
all
got
stories
to
swap
what
was
that
man
doing
besides
thumping
on
the
side
of
the
house
while
the
coffee
was
preparing
they
sat
close
to
the
fire
and
talked
the
twins
told
their
story
first
and
the
two
who
had
been
lost
listened
with
close
attention
then
while
they
all
drank
hot
coffee
barry
and
kent
related
the
events
of
the
day
they
had
put
the
lamp
out
and
the
fire
glowed
red
a
feeling
of
comfort
and
security
settled
over
them
in
spite
of
the
lurking
presence
of
the
one
who
was
seeking
to
annoy
them
although
they
were
tired
they
had
too
much
to
discuss
to
want
to
go
to
bed
at
the
moment
so
you
didn
t
bring
home
mac
s
hog
grindings
tim
grinned
we
were
lucky
to
bring
ourselves
home
kent
retorted
but
we
are
sure
that
we
know
where
the
sled
is
and
if
the
storm
lets
up
tomorrow
we
ll
go
get
mac
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
shielding
his
eyes
from
the
light
of
the
fire
i
believe
that
the
worst
of
it
is
over
already
he
declared
the
flakes
are
coming
down
he
turned
back
and
sat
down
in
a
wicker
chair
we
certainly
are
glad
to
see
you
back
the
sight
of
this
lodge
was
certainly
a
most
welcome
one
grinned
barry
we
didn
t
care
whether
it
was
haunted
or
not
they
talked
for
a
time
and
then
sought
their
beds
kent
and
barry
were
pleased
at
the
change
of
quarters
they
lugged
in
the
mattresses
from
the
beds
in
the
cold
bedrooms
and
placed
them
on
the
floor
mac
selected
the
wide
sofa
for
his
resting
place
and
when
they
had
washed
and
were
ready
they
stretched
out
on
the
mattresses
with
various
feelings
of
satisfaction
i
never
was
so
tired
kent
yawned
what
about
keeping
guard
tim
suggested
suppose
that
thumping
knocking
idiot
comes
around
again
i
won
t
hear
his
thumping
or
knocking
barry
predicted
with
a
grin
i
won
t
either
kent
said
looks
like
you
ford
boys
will
have
to
do
the
i
m
not
going
to
chase
him
tim
promised
we
won
t
have
to
stand
guard
was
mac
s
opinion
i
m
a
pretty
light
sleeper
and
maybe
i
ll
wake
up
if
anything
goes
wrong
we
ll
hope
he
doesn
t
come
back
little
more
was
said
and
the
boys
went
to
sleep
thoroughly
exhausted
they
had
not
slept
well
since
coming
to
lake
arrowtip
and
there
was
no
guarantee
that
they
would
not
be
disturbed
before
morning
but
they
went
to
sleep
trusting
that
all
would
be
well
this
time
good
fortune
was
on
their
side
and
they
slept
soundly
until
somewhat
late
in
the
morning
the
mattresses
were
soft
and
comfortable
and
the
room
was
warm
most
of
the
night
barry
was
the
first
to
awaken
and
when
he
had
looked
around
and
noted
that
his
companions
were
still
asleep
he
lowered
his
head
and
slept
for
another
mac
was
the
first
to
get
up
and
he
looked
at
the
clock
he
whistled
for
the
love
of
mike
what
hardy
campers
we
are
he
reached
over
and
took
the
poker
and
proceeded
to
beat
on
the
side
of
the
coal
scuttle
wake
up
the
enemy
is
upon
you
the
others
quickly
woke
up
and
looked
around
the
room
in
some
confusion
you
re
the
only
enemy
we
have
growled
kent
that
s
a
sign
that
you
are
a
great
man
chuckled
mac
all
great
men
have
enemies
for
breakfast
they
finished
up
the
pork
and
beans
left
from
the
previous
night
most
of
their
provisions
were
on
the
sled
and
as
soon
as
they
had
set
the
lodge
in
order
they
prepared
to
set
off
for
the
woods
to
find
the
missing
vehicle
it
had
stopped
snowing
sometime
during
the
night
and
the
sun
was
struggling
to
come
out
of
the
gray
clouds
i
guess
the
spook
didn
t
come
back
last
night
tim
remarked
as
they
started
out
if
he
did
i
didn
t
hear
him
barry
declared
i
slept
like
a
log
the
whole
night
not
even
a
dream
disturbed
i
wasn
t
quite
as
lucky
as
that
kent
told
them
i
kept
dreaming
over
and
over
again
that
i
was
wandering
around
in
circles
but
i
didn
t
hear
anything
not
even
mac
s
snores
i
don
t
snore
retorted
mac
at
least
i
ve
never
heard
myself
barry
and
kent
were
going
by
guesswork
and
at
first
were
unable
to
find
the
place
where
they
had
left
the
sled
but
just
as
they
were
becoming
discouraged
kent
pointed
off
to
the
left
there
s
a
small
bluff
and
it
looks
like
it
might
be
the
place
he
said
it
was
snowing
so
hard
at
the
time
that
we
couldn
t
be
certain
of
anything
barry
said
but
that
looks
like
the
place
yes
it
is
they
found
the
sled
still
buried
under
the
tree
limbs
and
bushes
but
it
was
evident
that
some
animal
had
been
scratching
around
in
an
effort
to
get
at
it
probably
a
fox
was
tim
s
guess
nothing
had
been
disturbed
however
and
they
started
back
to
the
lodge
with
the
sled
as
they
came
out
of
the
timber
mac
pointed
ahead
of
them
somebody
is
standing
close
to
the
lodge
he
said
in
a
low
voice
they
saw
a
man
standing
near
the
front
porch
looking
around
him
as
though
in
perplexity
he
was
evidently
a
woodsman
and
he
held
something
in
his
hand
upon
seeing
the
boys
he
hastened
to
meet
them
he
greeted
which
one
of
you
boys
is
named
garrison
i
am
barry
informed
him
the
man
held
out
a
letter
here
s
a
letter
to
you
i
passed
through
fox
point
this
mornin
and
i
m
goin
down
to
the
head
of
the
lake
so
the
storekeeper
asked
me
to
take
thanks
a
lot
barry
acknowledged
noting
that
it
was
from
his
father
you
re
welcome
sure
the
man
replied
as
he
turned
away
stop
and
have
some
dinner
with
us
kent
called
but
the
man
smiled
and
shook
his
head
had
mine
already
thanks
to
you
he
replied
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
barry
read
his
letter
while
the
others
were
preparing
dinner
and
his
face
was
a
study
as
he
finished
it
no
bad
news
is
there
kent
asked
barry
shook
his
head
no
but
my
dad
says
we
had
better
come
on
home
school
starts
again
tuesday
and
he
thinks
i
ought
to
be
home
so
as
to
get
ready
to
study
for
the
next
term
when
he
wrote
this
he
hadn
t
received
my
letter
of
course
i
suppose
we
ll
have
to
go
the
others
had
stopped
their
preparations
for
the
noon
meal
and
had
clustered
around
that
means
go
home
tomorrow
mac
pointed
out
barry
nodded
yes
it
does
and
i
think
we
ought
to
get
up
early
and
make
our
trip
all
in
the
one
day
instead
of
camping
out
overnight
it
can
be
done
easily
enough
kent
agreed
well
i
didn
t
realize
that
our
time
was
up
so
soon
we
haven
t
solved
our
mystery
that
s
exactly
what
is
bothering
me
barry
declared
we
have
been
here
long
enough
to
have
the
ghost
or
prowler
make
raps
and
knocks
and
then
we
have
let
him
slip
right
out
of
our
fingers
it
won
t
be
easy
to
tell
that
to
dad
though
i
feel
sure
that
he
ll
understand
that
we
did
the
best
we
could
but
it
is
a
big
disappointment
to
we
really
should
have
had
more
time
on
the
case
tim
said
maybe
something
will
happen
tonight
and
we
can
lay
hands
on
the
one
we
that
s
our
only
hope
kent
declared
something
must
happen
tonight
they
spent
the
afternoon
at
the
lodge
and
for
supper
mac
had
his
sausage
after
supper
they
chatted
and
enjoyed
their
last
evening
in
the
hunting
lodge
they
arranged
to
take
turns
watching
through
the
night
and
barry
took
the
first
session
while
the
others
slept
he
sat
in
a
big
chair
back
in
the
shadows
his
eyes
and
ears
alert
mac
followed
him
and
then
the
others
but
nothing
amiss
happened
and
when
daylight
came
they
were
forced
to
realize
that
their
last
chance
had
passed
nothing
doing
we
ve
failed
remarked
barry
somewhat
bitterly
as
soon
as
they
had
had
breakfast
they
set
the
lodge
in
order
and
then
left
it
making
sure
that
everything
was
in
its
place
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
skates
were
strapped
on
and
they
struck
out
briskly
before
the
sun
had
risen
very
high
they
had
entered
the
mouth
of
buffalo
and
were
going
downriver
at
a
good
pace
it
was
evident
that
they
would
arrive
in
cloverfield
soon
after
dark
but
the
thought
did
not
make
them
as
happy
as
it
should
have
they
were
deeply
disappointed
at
their
failure
maybe
we
can
come
back
in
the
summer
and
camp
there
tim
said
as
they
talked
it
over
around
the
fire
of
their
noon
camp
the
summer
is
a
long
way
off
declared
barry
gloomily
i
wish
we
had
landed
him
this
time
but
i
guess
we
lost
our
opportunity
once
and
for
chapter
xix
an
interview
with
a
client
as
the
boys
had
calculated
they
reached
cloverfield
well
after
dark
in
discussing
it
at
noontime
they
agreed
not
to
pause
for
an
evening
meal
but
to
push
on
and
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
accordingly
they
kept
up
a
fast
pace
and
had
it
not
been
for
frequent
detours
around
places
and
logs
they
would
have
made
it
by
early
darkness
but
as
it
was
they
did
well
and
saw
the
lights
of
their
home
city
before
them
at
o
clock
by
eight
they
had
reached
their
homes
and
barry
went
in
after
a
few
final
words
with
kent
the
light
and
warmth
struck
him
pleasantly
as
he
stepped
in
the
door
his
mother
and
sister
were
in
the
kitchen
washing
and
drying
dishes
and
his
father
was
just
coming
up
from
the
cellar
where
he
had
been
putting
more
coal
on
the
furnace
they
heard
his
footsteps
along
the
hall
and
greeted
him
eagerly
we
didn
t
know
whether
you
would
get
in
tonight
or
tomorrow
his
mother
said
as
she
kissed
him
did
you
have
your
supper
pearl
asked
i
ll
get
you
some
if
you
didn
i
haven
t
had
any
pearl
and
i
ll
tell
mac
what
a
nice
girl
you
are
if
you
ll
get
me
some
barry
answered
with
a
grin
oh
get
out
pearl
retorted
her
cheeks
flushing
if
you
keep
on
talking
that
way
i
won
t
do
anything
for
you
i
got
your
letter
son
garrison
told
him
so
you
moved
into
the
lodge
when
you
found
that
someone
had
been
upstairs
in
the
place
have
any
luck
did
you
see
anything
the
only
luck
we
had
was
bad
luck
barry
replied
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
hung
his
skates
in
the
we
saw
the
spook
and
thought
we
had
him
bottled
up
but
he
got
what
cried
his
father
in
genuine
astonishment
his
mother
looked
on
in
surprise
and
pearl
turned
from
the
ice
box
to
glance
at
him
oh
barry
what
did
he
look
like
he
looked
just
like
a
man
but
we
didn
t
see
his
face
her
brother
informed
her
as
he
washed
his
hands
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
while
i
they
were
all
so
eager
to
hear
his
story
that
all
three
of
them
fell
to
waiting
on
him
and
while
he
ate
he
told
them
the
complete
story
of
the
black
shadow
who
had
made
the
thumps
and
knocks
his
father
listened
with
puckered
brow
and
leaned
forward
on
the
kitchen
table
in
his
eagerness
i
m
glad
you
and
kent
weren
t
lost
in
that
storm
his
mother
said
looking
fondly
at
her
vigorous
son
my
goodness
i
would
have
been
scared
to
death
if
i
had
seen
that
figure
run
along
the
side
of
the
lodge
pearl
declared
barry
i
think
morganson
ought
to
hear
that
story
garrison
remarked
feel
like
going
over
to
her
house
tonight
of
course
dad
if
you
give
me
time
to
clean
up
a
bit
i
m
still
dressed
as
a
camper
you
that
won
t
bother
morganson
but
i
agree
that
you
ought
at
least
to
change
your
shirt
you
do
that
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
and
i
ll
telephone
her
and
ask
if
we
may
come
barry
nodded
his
agreement
and
his
father
was
soon
talking
to
his
client
over
the
wire
in
a
few
moments
he
came
back
putting
on
his
overcoat
as
he
came
she
says
she
ll
be
glad
to
see
us
he
said
i
ll
get
the
car
out
and
we
ll
go
over
as
soon
as
you
are
barry
rose
from
the
table
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
couple
of
shakes
he
raced
up
the
front
stairs
and
before
long
was
running
down
them
again
with
a
clean
shirt
and
his
hair
neatly
combed
did
dad
come
in
he
asked
his
mother
no
he
s
out
front
sitting
in
the
car
and
waiting
for
you
she
said
he
had
faith
in
you
when
you
said
you
d
only
be
a
couple
of
shakes
he
seemed
to
know
what
a
shake
just
two
shakes
of
a
lamb
s
tail
mother
is
that
all
the
time
i
took
yes
if
the
lambs
shook
them
pretty
slowly
garrison
smiled
barry
trotted
down
the
walk
and
got
into
the
car
all
right
dad
here
i
morganson
lived
on
the
other
side
of
cloverfield
and
after
driving
several
blocks
garrison
brought
the
car
to
a
stop
in
front
of
a
fine
old
white
house
that
stood
back
among
some
magnificent
trees
as
they
opened
the
door
to
get
out
of
the
car
the
front
door
of
the
big
house
opened
and
a
man
came
down
the
steps
and
approached
them
as
the
lamplight
revealed
him
garrison
murmured
his
name
brand
curry
i
wonder
the
rather
chunky
individual
merely
grunted
and
gave
a
short
nod
he
seemed
out
of
humor
and
would
have
passed
on
but
barry
s
father
hailed
him
just
a
moment
curry
have
you
been
in
to
see
morganson
about
the
bluff
lodge
proposition
again
curry
swung
around
and
faced
him
abruptly
it
is
none
of
your
business
what
i
went
to
see
morganson
about
i
m
glad
to
hear
that
the
lawyer
returned
evenly
if
it
was
about
that
hunting
lodge
it
is
my
business
but
if
you
weren
t
talking
about
that
it
wasn
i
did
go
see
morganson
the
man
admitted
defiantly
well
that
s
just
what
i
thought
curry
why
don
t
you
come
to
me
i
am
her
representative
and
she
is
not
to
be
bothered
with
the
details
why
is
it
that
you
don
t
come
to
me
mr
garrison
this
is
a
free
country
and
i
go
where
i
like
i
prefer
to
deal
directly
with
morganson
that
is
is
it
because
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
curry
barry
s
father
asked
i
have
my
reasons
garrison
and
i
will
keep
them
to
myself
good
night
curry
walked
away
with
dignity
and
garrison
shook
his
head
in
perplexity
he
s
a
hard
man
to
deal
with
and
he
never
has
been
willing
to
talk
over
this
particular
deal
with
me
he
didn
t
act
very
happy
did
he
no
barry
chuckled
maybe
morganson
told
him
to
go
and
see
we
ll
soon
know
said
garrison
leading
the
way
into
the
house
at
his
knock
a
servant
let
them
in
and
showed
them
to
a
small
private
library
where
morganson
was
reading
she
welcomed
them
with
kindness
and
they
sat
close
to
a
grate
fire
as
they
talked
as
i
told
you
over
the
phone
morganson
my
son
has
something
of
importance
to
tell
you
concerning
bluff
lodge
garrison
began
he
and
three
of
his
friends
have
been
camping
up
on
arrowtip
and
he
learned
some
interesting
things
the
last
two
days
that
they
were
at
the
lake
they
camped
in
the
lodge
morganson
looked
with
interest
at
barry
and
her
words
were
a
distinct
surprise
i
know
that
he
and
his
friends
have
been
camping
in
the
lodge
she
said
mr
brand
curry
has
just
been
here
to
protest
about
it
chapter
xx
an
unexpected
event
barry
and
his
father
exchanged
glances
to
protest
about
it
garrison
cried
yes
the
lady
nodded
he
said
that
it
lowered
the
value
of
the
place
to
allow
boys
to
camp
there
he
seemed
quite
annoyed
about
but
how
did
he
know
that
we
were
there
barry
inquired
he
said
that
someone
who
knew
the
place
had
been
up
there
lately
and
saw
the
boys
in
the
lodge
i
asked
him
if
they
had
done
anything
to
hurt
the
place
and
he
said
no
but
that
he
thought
it
was
wrong
to
allow
boys
to
camp
well
he
certainly
has
a
nerve
said
garrison
that
property
doesn
t
belong
to
him
and
he
has
nothing
to
say
as
to
what
shall
be
done
with
he
wants
it
badly
enough
and
as
good
as
told
me
tonight
that
he
will
have
it
morganson
said
he
is
very
discourteous
about
it
all
frowned
barry
s
father
i
stopped
him
tonight
and
asked
him
why
he
does
not
come
to
me
he
said
it
is
a
free
country
and
he
prefers
to
go
to
you
morganson
smiled
a
quiet
smile
probably
he
thinks
he
can
win
me
over
or
even
scare
me
he
is
offering
a
very
low
price
for
the
lodge
and
i
am
not
going
to
sell
it
at
his
figure
he
knows
the
value
of
the
property
and
could
make
a
lot
out
of
it
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
my
hunting
lodge
away
now
i
d
like
to
hear
barry
s
barry
told
the
owner
of
the
hunting
lodge
what
had
happened
while
they
had
camped
at
lake
arrowtip
the
only
thing
that
we
regret
he
finished
is
the
fact
that
we
did
not
catch
the
man
after
we
saw
him
go
into
the
tool
shed
we
feel
that
if
we
could
have
had
a
few
days
longer
we
would
have
learned
the
secret
of
the
it
is
too
bad
that
your
short
vacation
came
to
an
end
when
it
did
acknowledged
the
lady
but
i
think
you
did
a
fine
bit
of
work
as
it
is
of
course
i
have
believed
all
along
that
some
human
being
is
doing
this
unpleasantness
and
not
any
ghostly
being
the
mystery
is
who
is
doing
it
and
why
do
you
believe
that
mr
brand
curry
is
doing
it
to
lower
the
value
of
the
lodge
barry
asked
slowly
morganson
smiled
at
his
father
as
she
shook
her
head
your
father
and
i
have
wondered
about
that
but
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
so
she
said
mr
curry
is
always
here
in
town
and
we
can
not
believe
that
the
lodge
is
so
dear
to
him
that
he
keeps
a
sort
of
scare
agent
up
there
all
the
time
just
as
soon
as
any
party
goes
into
the
lodge
either
in
winter
or
summer
the
annoyances
begin
that
would
seem
to
indicate
that
whoever
does
it
lives
close
by
there
all
the
time
we
know
that
curry
is
anxious
to
have
the
place
but
so
are
three
other
business
men
who
are
offering
better
prices
than
curry
it
is
all
mighty
queer
barry
murmured
have
you
ever
heard
from
your
nephew
since
the
letter
came
from
canada
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
now
in
south
america
morganson
said
i
believe
that
he
was
taken
away
from
my
property
because
he
had
discovered
something
that
certain
parties
do
not
want
there
was
a
frenchman
who
disappeared
at
the
same
time
barry
pressed
what
of
him
was
he
married
yes
he
was
married
and
his
wife
was
also
working
at
the
lodge
when
her
husband
left
nothing
has
ever
been
heard
of
them
since
that
for
another
they
talked
of
the
mystery
and
then
barry
and
his
father
left
nothing
definite
had
been
agreed
to
though
garrison
had
expressed
a
desire
to
make
a
trip
to
arrowtip
himself
and
spend
a
night
or
two
in
the
lodge
alone
but
morganson
was
not
in
favor
of
the
idea
let
us
wait
until
spring
comes
before
we
do
anything
else
she
advised
it
is
so
cold
and
disagreeable
now
i
will
not
rent
it
to
anyone
from
now
on
and
when
the
warm
weather
comes
we
can
have
some
more
private
detectives
put
on
the
case
let
s
not
worry
about
it
until
barry
and
his
father
went
home
and
talked
over
the
situation
at
length
and
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
when
spring
came
they
would
go
to
the
lake
together
with
the
other
boys
and
have
another
opportunity
to
match
wits
with
the
disturbing
element
of
the
hunting
lodge
school
was
not
to
begin
before
tuesday
and
on
monday
morning
barry
stood
at
the
general
desk
in
the
local
post
office
writing
out
a
card
no
one
else
was
in
the
place
at
the
time
except
the
two
clerks
back
of
the
windows
while
barry
was
busily
engaged
the
door
opened
and
a
schoolmate
named
charlie
black
came
in
he
was
a
short
energetic
young
fellow
with
glasses
and
shrewd
laughing
eyes
a
great
favorite
at
the
high
school
where
he
led
in
debates
and
any
form
of
public
speaking
hello
little
fellow
barry
greeted
using
the
name
most
frequently
applied
to
young
black
looking
for
a
letter
from
your
girl
friend
hello
mystery
hunter
no
i
m
going
to
buy
some
this
having
been
taken
care
of
charlie
approached
the
desk
and
leaned
on
it
say
i
have
some
news
that
will
knock
your
eye
out
don
t
tell
it
to
me
then
because
i
need
all
my
eyes
you
ought
not
go
around
with
such
dangerous
news
barry
grinned
listen
barry
this
is
great
news
no
fooling
well
why
keep
it
to
yourself
let
s
have
it
no
school
for
about
ten
days
why
big
flue
from
the
furnace
burned
out
and
they
have
to
have
a
special
new
one
made
hurrah
what
luck
barry
shook
his
head
in
pretended
disgust
it
is
plain
to
see
that
you
ll
never
amount
to
anything
rejoicing
because
your
opportunity
to
learn
something
is
cut
off
your
lack
of
wholesome
ambition
is
pitiful
aw
listen
plaster
saint
you
re
just
as
tickled
as
i
am
the
difference
between
us
is
that
i
m
honest
say
i
have
some
more
news
good
night
you
ve
got
enough
of
it
in
you
to
explode
get
it
out
quick
what
else
happened
nothing
yet
but
it
is
going
to
happen
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
there
wasn
t
going
to
be
any
school
for
a
while
i
thought
it
would
be
a
dandy
idea
to
have
a
straw
ride
what
do
you
say
you
mean
hire
a
truck
or
wagon
and
a
bunch
of
fellows
and
girls
and
go
for
a
straw
ride
sure
how
else
would
you
go
on
a
straw
ride
where
will
we
go
i
don
t
know
yet
but
maybe
to
potter
s
mill
or
some
place
where
we
can
build
a
fire
and
cook
some
supper
and
then
we
ll
come
on
home
it
s
a
lot
of
fun
i
know
i
ve
been
on
one
before
only
it
was
in
the
summer
and
not
in
the
winter
what
s
the
matter
with
getting
about
three
or
four
sleighs
that
s
a
good
idea
will
you
and
kent
and
the
twins
come
along
i
guess
so
when
are
you
going
to
have
it
as
soon
as
we
can
i
ve
talked
to
a
few
seniors
about
it
and
they
are
willing
well
i
must
get
on
i
m
chairman
and
of
course
that
means
all
the
work
falls
on
me
funny
name
chairman
isn
t
it
why
well
the
chairman
never
gets
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
he
doesn
t
need
a
chair
ought
to
call
him
something
else
i
m
on
my
wait
a
minute
barry
requested
who
made
you
chairman
why
i
did
was
the
unblushing
answer
that
s
what
i
thought
popgun
go
ahead
and
do
your
organizing
and
we
ll
be
with
all
right
be
careful
crossing
corners
grinned
the
energetic
charlie
black
as
he
fairly
dashed
out
of
the
post
office
barry
followed
more
slowly
and
as
he
strolled
along
the
street
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
contemplated
straw
ride
and
the
mystery
at
lake
arrowtip
at
last
he
came
to
a
stop
and
his
face
brightened
up
of
course
he
murmured
why
not
abruptly
changing
his
course
he
turned
down
a
side
street
and
was
soon
going
up
the
walk
to
the
home
of
morganson
he
was
readily
admitted
and
the
lady
received
him
in
the
parlor
barry
rapidly
told
her
about
the
plans
for
the
straw
ride
what
i
want
to
ask
you
in
particular
morganson
is
this
may
we
ride
up
to
the
lodge
and
have
our
gathering
there
i
will
personally
guarantee
that
we
will
treat
the
place
well
and
it
would
not
suffer
any
from
our
visit
and
coach
jordan
and
jordan
will
be
with
us
i
m
sure
i
think
it
would
be
a
splendid
place
for
us
to
have
supper
and
we
could
spend
the
night
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
that
you
would
damage
the
lodge
morganson
smiled
are
you
sure
coach
and
jordan
will
go
with
you
yes
ma
am
coach
jordan
and
his
wife
always
go
with
us
and
i
guess
they
will
this
certainly
you
may
use
the
lodge
if
they
do
morganson
granted
i
m
just
hoping
you
won
t
have
any
trouble
with
that
unknown
person
that
you
saw
the
last
time
you
were
i
hardly
think
we
will
barry
said
but
if
we
do
kent
and
the
twins
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
and
perhaps
we
can
learn
something
more
about
a
few
minutes
later
barry
was
on
his
way
home
his
mind
busy
with
new
thoughts
and
ideas
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
hunt
up
his
chums
and
tell
them
of
the
latest
events
this
may
be
the
very
chance
we
have
been
looking
for
he
reflected
as
he
walked
briskly
along
the
man
always
starts
something
when
a
crowd
gathers
in
the
lodge
and
we
ll
be
there
all
night
if
the
bunch
will
agree
to
go
to
lake
arrowtip
the
four
of
us
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
any
such
visit
i
hope
this
will
all
work
out
as
i
want
it
to
chapter
xxi
the
straw
ride
after
dinner
that
day
barry
hunted
up
kent
and
the
twins
and
told
them
what
he
had
in
mind
they
fell
in
readily
with
his
plan
and
were
enthusiastic
regarding
the
delay
in
the
opening
of
school
too
bad
we
didn
t
know
that
before
we
came
home
tim
remarked
we
could
have
stayed
on
and
perhaps
we
would
have
run
down
the
evil
spirit
of
the
yes
that
s
so
barry
agreed
but
this
is
the
next
best
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
may
work
out
better
every
time
that
a
crowd
goes
to
the
lodge
something
happens
and
we
may
make
the
spook
play
right
into
our
we
re
taking
quite
a
chance
kent
shook
his
head
i
m
just
wondering
if
the
prowler
comes
out
on
the
first
night
or
if
he
waits
for
the
second
or
third
we
may
not
be
troubled
in
any
i
know
it
is
a
long
chance
barry
agreed
but
we
won
t
lose
anything
if
nothing
you
say
we
ought
to
stay
overnight
mac
spoke
up
will
the
bunch
do
it
they
may
not
want
to
go
to
bluff
lodge
in
the
first
i
m
going
to
see
charlie
black
and
try
and
make
him
enthusiastic
barry
smiled
then
he
ll
get
the
others
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
i
think
we
can
work
his
chums
having
agreed
to
the
program
barry
went
to
the
home
of
the
dashing
charlie
whom
he
found
in
his
den
the
popular
debater
was
practising
on
a
cornet
when
barry
entered
the
room
hi
greeted
the
cornetist
hastily
lowering
the
shining
instrument
come
in
but
as
the
sign
over
the
doorway
to
the
lower
regions
says
abandon
hope
all
ye
that
enter
i
ve
abandoned
all
hope
of
hearing
any
real
music
barry
grinned
what
are
you
trying
to
blow
that
thing
for
music
was
the
brisk
answer
you
re
pretty
good
at
chin
music
barry
replied
i
don
t
see
why
you
want
to
blow
a
horn
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
came
to
see
you
about
our
straw
the
cornet
was
tossed
with
unerring
aim
into
a
waste
basket
where
a
pile
of
crumpled
paper
broke
its
fall
charlie
spun
fully
around
in
his
chair
listen
fifteen
of
us
are
going
counting
you
and
kent
and
the
ford
boys
there
may
be
others
too
i
ll
see
coach
and
jordan
tonight
and
see
if
they
ll
go
along
how
s
that
for
progress
wonderful
barry
admitted
you
re
a
great
organizer
charlie
where
are
we
going
on
this
ride
i
still
have
potter
s
mill
in
mind
what
do
you
think
that
s
my
dog
i
call
him
castor
oil
a
large
animal
had
come
bounding
into
the
den
and
jumped
up
on
the
leather
couch
where
barry
was
sitting
before
the
boy
could
move
the
dog
had
shot
out
a
big
red
tongue
and
licked
his
face
barry
ducked
and
hastily
brushed
his
hand
over
his
cheek
get
down
castor
commanded
charlie
sternly
and
the
dog
obeyed
in
a
clumsy
manner
what
do
you
call
him
castor
oil
for
barry
demanded
because
he
is
a
big
nuisance
follows
me
around
and
jumps
on
people
he
s
about
as
welcome
as
castor
oil
i
don
t
like
to
take
him
places
one
day
i
was
thinking
up
a
name
for
him
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
thinking
that
i
didn
t
like
to
take
him
around
with
me
i
tried
to
think
of
something
else
i
don
t
like
to
take
and
then
the
name
just
came
by
itself
somehow
good
name
eh
well
about
the
kind
of
name
i
d
expect
you
to
give
grunted
barry
but
to
get
back
to
business
how
about
taking
our
party
up
to
bluff
lodge
on
lake
arrowtip
it
is
a
dandy
place
and
we
could
stay
all
night
i
got
permission
from
morganson
to
use
the
lodge
if
we
want
humph
that
s
the
haunted
house
isn
t
it
well
the
four
of
us
camped
in
it
a
few
days
and
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
us
barry
replied
that
sounds
like
a
good
place
to
go
charlie
nodded
gently
pulling
the
big
ears
of
the
dog
with
the
questionable
name
what
kind
of
a
looking
place
is
it
barry
described
the
lodge
to
him
and
charlie
was
enthusiastic
say
that
will
be
a
dandy
place
fireplaces
and
stoves
and
bedrooms
and
all
but
we
d
have
to
stay
overnight
wouldn
t
we
yes
but
we
wouldn
t
mind
that
coach
and
jordan
will
be
along
and
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
we
can
take
enough
for
our
supper
and
breakfast
the
following
morning
how
are
you
going
to
go
in
sleighs
charlie
returned
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
get
hold
of
sleighs
of
course
it
isn
t
much
of
a
straw
ride
when
you
take
it
in
a
sleigh
i
ve
always
thought
of
a
straw
or
a
hay
ride
as
one
where
you
go
in
a
truck
or
a
big
wagon
with
straw
on
the
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
said
barry
as
far
as
that
goes
we
can
put
straw
on
the
bottom
of
the
sleighs
so
you
agree
to
the
lodge
proposition
sure
thing
you
ask
all
of
them
you
see
if
they
ll
stay
overnight
and
i
ll
do
the
same
we
ll
make
this
a
dandy
outing
say
want
to
hear
a
little
music
on
my
new
cornet
i
don
t
care
my
nerves
are
in
pretty
good
order
today
castor
oil
s
aren
t
replied
charlie
as
he
took
the
instrument
from
the
waste
basket
he
howls
every
time
i
go
at
after
leaving
charlie
black
s
house
barry
started
home
intending
to
stop
and
see
some
of
the
boys
who
were
going
on
the
ride
as
he
came
to
a
certain
corner
he
heard
the
noise
of
an
oncoming
car
and
as
it
was
traveling
at
a
fast
pace
he
paused
on
the
curbing
and
let
it
rush
past
him
glancing
at
the
driver
he
saw
that
it
was
carter
wolf
and
one
companion
they
looked
at
him
but
nothing
was
said
and
the
car
passed
on
so
he
is
back
from
rake
island
barry
reflected
as
he
went
on
that
night
at
the
supper
table
pearl
spoke
about
the
contemplated
trip
i
hear
that
we
are
going
to
stay
overnight
at
bluff
lodge
barry
did
you
plan
that
yes
her
brother
nodded
i
didn
t
know
that
anyone
except
seniors
were
just
a
few
pearl
answered
i
m
one
of
the
lucky
ones
i
hope
we
don
t
see
that
black
shadow
or
anything
what
is
the
idea
of
going
up
there
son
garrison
asked
two
reasons
dad
his
son
replied
one
is
that
the
place
is
ideal
for
an
overnight
trip
and
another
is
that
we
hope
to
draw
the
man
out
and
perhaps
get
a
chance
to
nail
him
the
twins
and
kent
and
i
will
be
on
the
he
turned
to
his
sister
pearl
please
don
t
tell
anyone
about
that
black
shadow
or
anything
else
we
want
the
whole
thing
kept
absolutely
quiet
so
that
we
can
do
something
if
we
get
the
i
won
t
breathe
a
word
barry
and
i
ll
even
try
not
to
look
scared
his
sister
promised
that
s
a
big
job
for
you
garrison
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
m
afraid
you
ll
get
hurt
his
mother
worried
i
don
t
think
so
was
barry
s
reply
after
all
nothing
may
happen
no
one
may
come
around
besides
that
coach
jordan
will
be
with
us
and
so
will
a
number
of
the
other
fellows
so
we
ought
not
to
have
any
plans
for
the
straw
ride
went
forward
in
a
satisfactory
manner
charlie
black
took
it
upon
himself
to
see
everyone
who
could
possibly
go
from
the
upper
class
and
in
the
end
sixteen
of
the
young
people
of
cloverfield
high
school
consented
to
go
and
spend
a
night
at
bluff
lodge
of
these
sixteen
nine
were
girls
and
seven
of
them
boys
the
other
two
members
of
the
sleigh
party
were
the
popular
football
coach
and
his
wife
both
of
whom
were
young
and
in
sympathy
with
the
fun
of
the
young
people
it
had
been
agreed
that
each
one
was
to
bring
a
certain
item
of
the
provisions
to
be
used
on
the
trip
and
at
last
everything
was
in
readiness
on
the
night
before
they
were
to
start
the
four
chums
attended
a
show
and
when
they
came
out
they
were
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
snowing
they
halted
outside
the
bulk
of
the
crowd
and
waited
for
charlie
to
join
them
they
had
seen
him
wave
from
the
steps
of
the
theater
the
little
chairman
wants
us
kent
remarked
let
s
see
what
he
has
in
mind
this
snow
will
make
our
trip
a
pretty
one
if
it
doesn
t
get
too
deep
barry
said
as
they
waited
it
won
t
turn
into
a
blizzard
tim
felt
sure
what
is
all
that
about
mac
asked
charlie
as
he
joined
the
group
charlie
looked
all
around
them
in
a
mysterious
way
have
you
fellows
heard
anything
he
asked
i
ve
heard
a
whole
lot
of
things
but
maybe
not
what
you
mean
smiled
barry
what
s
up
why
i
heard
that
carter
wolf
and
his
crowd
are
going
to
try
and
break
into
our
party
or
break
it
up
or
something
you
know
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talking
about
our
trip
and
he
heard
it
he
says
he
and
some
friends
were
shot
at
one
night
near
that
lodge
and
that
you
fellows
know
very
well
that
it
is
just
the
same
we
re
not
afraid
to
go
up
there
kent
replied
somebody
did
shoot
at
him
near
the
lodge
but
it
wasn
t
us
i
hope
he
doesn
t
spoil
our
party
by
scaring
any
of
the
fellows
or
it
won
t
scare
them
charlie
cried
they
ll
only
want
to
go
all
the
more
but
we
had
better
keep
our
eyes
open
for
any
monkey
business
from
wolf
and
some
of
his
we
will
barry
promised
on
the
following
day
the
party
started
for
bluff
lodge
the
sleighs
all
came
together
at
kent
s
house
and
after
they
were
all
in
their
places
the
procession
started
in
the
foremost
sled
sat
the
chairman
and
beside
him
between
charlie
and
barry
castor
oil
reared
his
big
head
couldn
t
keep
him
at
home
charlie
explained
i
didn
t
want
to
take
it
was
a
fairly
long
journey
to
the
lodge
and
so
they
started
at
noontime
by
road
it
was
much
shorter
than
by
going
up
the
river
it
was
a
clear
cold
day
and
they
enjoyed
the
swift
motion
of
the
sleighs
talk
and
laughter
ran
high
and
they
called
jokingly
from
sled
to
sled
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
dusk
was
just
spreading
across
the
lake
country
when
they
emerged
from
the
timber
and
came
in
sight
of
the
lodge
building
hurrah
we
re
here
shouted
charlie
thumping
castor
oil
who
barked
in
protest
so
that
is
the
haunted
lodge
a
girl
in
the
second
sled
cried
i
wonder
if
we
ll
see
the
ghost
chapter
xxii
barry
s
great
discovery
barry
jumped
from
the
sled
and
took
out
the
keys
while
the
others
were
dismounting
from
the
sleighs
tim
and
mac
lifted
a
large
oil
can
from
the
vehicle
they
had
come
in
the
others
stood
in
the
snow
and
stamped
their
feet
glad
to
move
about
once
more
after
sitting
so
long
coach
jordan
helped
some
of
the
boys
tie
the
horses
to
the
rail
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
an
angry
red
haze
and
the
darkness
was
spreading
rapidly
accompanied
by
a
cold
that
nipped
and
penetrated
them
although
they
knew
that
the
lodge
would
be
cold
the
visitors
were
glad
to
follow
barry
and
the
twins
inside
kent
made
a
quick
trip
around
the
big
log
building
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
and
he
returned
satisfied
the
twins
lighted
the
lamps
that
were
already
in
the
big
living
room
and
in
the
meantime
barry
collected
some
wood
soaked
it
with
oil
and
touched
the
flame
of
a
match
to
it
after
the
flames
were
leaping
up
the
chimney
he
got
some
coal
and
put
it
on
the
burning
wood
the
room
began
to
get
warm
slowly
the
girls
and
boys
roamed
around
admiring
the
place
and
at
last
they
began
to
take
off
coats
and
hats
as
the
room
warmed
up
from
the
living
room
kent
and
barry
moved
into
the
two
bedrooms
and
lighted
fires
in
them
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
stay
there
all
night
without
discomfort
soon
the
grates
in
those
rooms
were
glowing
and
the
lodge
had
become
comfortable
they
decided
to
do
their
cooking
in
the
kitchen
and
accordingly
a
fire
was
kindled
in
the
big
range
there
this
was
something
more
of
a
task
because
the
stove
was
rusty
and
clogged
with
ashes
and
tin
cans
left
by
some
careless
and
untidy
campers
the
boys
cleaned
the
stove
out
and
after
this
was
done
the
fire
burned
well
some
of
them
favored
using
the
dining
room
but
the
majority
vote
was
that
they
eat
in
the
living
room
by
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
large
grate
there
all
of
them
were
hungry
and
so
the
girls
took
charge
of
the
supper
preparation
under
the
expert
leadership
of
jordan
the
boys
sat
in
the
living
room
with
the
coach
and
chatted
about
winter
sports
in
a
very
short
time
the
delightful
smell
of
things
cooking
reached
them
the
coach
smiled
as
he
heard
the
murmurs
of
appreciation
that
s
a
tempting
smell
boys
he
said
this
lake
arrowtip
air
is
a
great
tonic
we
found
it
that
way
tim
grinned
charlie
was
seldom
able
to
sit
still
long
at
a
time
and
he
bounded
off
to
the
kitchen
followed
by
the
faithful
castor
oil
before
long
he
was
back
rigged
out
in
an
apron
and
a
paper
hat
obviously
in
the
capacity
of
a
waiter
disregarding
the
jokes
of
the
boys
he
began
to
set
things
in
order
for
supper
it
seemed
to
the
hungry
boys
that
the
meal
was
a
long
time
coming
but
the
girls
declared
with
spirit
that
it
hadn
t
taken
much
time
except
to
those
who
sat
around
waiting
for
it
the
time
finally
came
when
they
were
all
sitting
close
to
the
fire
eating
steak
and
potatoes
talking
and
enjoying
themselves
all
lamps
had
been
put
out
and
only
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
illuminated
the
room
but
by
this
time
the
fire
was
a
solid
mass
of
glowing
coals
and
a
sufficient
light
was
rendered
for
all
their
shadows
clustered
on
the
wall
back
of
them
and
you
four
boys
camped
here
for
a
few
days
just
like
this
a
senior
girl
asked
the
four
chums
wasn
t
it
delightful
we
enjoyed
it
kent
nodded
we
weren
t
here
all
the
time
though
at
first
we
camped
over
in
that
smaller
cabin
that
you
could
see
as
we
drove
what
made
you
leave
it
jordan
asked
this
was
getting
close
to
things
that
the
boys
did
not
want
to
reveal
but
before
kent
could
answer
barry
broke
in
that
little
cabin
was
cold
and
the
floor
was
hard
to
sleep
on
he
said
then
one
night
a
limb
dropped
on
the
roof
and
scared
us
quite
a
bit
so
we
decided
to
move
in
here
tim
and
mac
did
the
moving
and
kent
and
i
got
lost
in
a
storm
that
but
what
about
all
the
ghost
stories
we
hear
another
girl
asked
is
there
a
ghost
around
pretty
cold
for
a
ghost
barry
smiled
we
ve
been
here
two
hours
or
more
and
haven
t
heard
anything
i
hope
we
don
t
said
another
girl
looking
around
the
room
uneasily
it
will
be
all
right
charlie
black
assured
her
we
ll
let
castor
oil
loose
all
night
and
he
ll
sic
the
ghost
he
s
a
fine
the
spook
will
run
if
he
ever
finds
out
the
dog
s
name
said
mac
amid
a
general
laugh
coach
how
about
telling
us
a
good
ghost
story
tonight
bill
jefferson
asked
the
atmosphere
is
just
the
atmosphere
is
all
right
the
athletic
instructor
smiled
but
i
m
afraid
of
some
nerves
around
here
i
know
a
ghost
story
wouldn
t
bother
the
boys
but
i
don
t
want
to
upset
the
but
the
girls
themselves
begged
him
to
tell
at
least
one
after
the
meal
was
over
and
at
length
he
agreed
to
do
so
coach
jordan
was
a
good
story
teller
and
many
times
he
had
spun
some
lively
yarns
while
on
overnight
hikes
with
the
boys
of
cloverfield
he
excelled
in
creepy
mystery
stories
and
the
young
people
looked
forward
with
eager
anticipation
to
a
good
one
after
supper
how
about
some
boy
volunteers
to
dry
dishes
pearl
asked
as
they
got
up
to
carry
plates
back
to
the
kitchen
we
did
all
the
work
of
preparing
supper
i
know
that
most
of
you
boys
camp
out
so
you
must
know
how
to
wash
and
dry
dishes
how
about
letting
castor
oil
lick
all
the
plates
and
then
drying
them
over
the
stove
charlie
shouted
but
an
indignant
chorus
of
voices
answered
him
and
he
went
off
chuckling
all
right
the
men
will
take
charge
of
the
kitchen
from
now
on
cried
coach
jordan
no
ladies
allowed
out
there
except
to
bring
your
that
s
the
spirit
commended
ruth
carrier
the
leader
among
the
girls
we
ll
start
to
toast
some
marshmallows
for
agreeable
all
around
kent
nodded
and
the
boys
took
over
the
kitchen
work
while
the
girls
went
back
to
the
living
room
to
toast
the
marshmallows
jordan
and
kent
did
the
washing
and
the
other
boys
dried
the
dishes
after
a
time
they
looked
around
for
a
pail
to
put
scraps
in
but
there
was
none
in
the
kitchen
barry
seized
a
lantern
i
think
i
remember
seeing
one
in
the
tool
house
he
said
as
he
opened
the
back
door
i
ll
be
right
the
horses
tied
to
the
rail
of
the
porch
moved
restlessly
as
he
passed
by
them
on
his
way
across
the
board
platform
fodder
had
been
brought
for
them
and
as
soon
as
the
dishes
were
dried
the
boys
planned
to
move
the
horses
to
a
big
shed
back
of
the
lodge
which
served
as
a
combination
barn
and
garage
barry
arrived
at
the
tool
house
and
went
inside
peering
around
in
the
feeble
light
from
the
lamp
at
the
far
end
of
the
place
he
saw
a
tin
can
there
it
is
i
thought
i
remembered
seeing
it
in
here
this
is
ouch
he
had
tripped
on
something
and
he
flashed
the
light
down
to
see
what
it
was
he
was
close
beside
the
bale
of
hay
that
stood
there
and
as
he
examined
the
floor
he
saw
that
it
was
slightly
raised
this
interested
him
and
he
put
his
hand
down
and
pulled
the
raised
boards
toward
him
to
his
surprise
several
of
them
came
up
a
few
inches
what
the
dickens
is
this
with
a
single
motion
of
his
arm
he
pushed
the
bale
of
hay
aside
and
stared
at
the
floor
a
long
trapdoor
was
revealed
and
with
trembling
fingers
he
raised
it
looking
down
into
a
deep
well
of
darkness
a
pair
of
wooden
stairs
ran
down
to
the
floor
of
a
passage
an
underground
passage
barry
breathed
now
i
m
beginning
to
see
a
few
things
for
several
seconds
he
stood
staring
down
into
the
tunnel
remembering
how
the
black
shadow
had
disappeared
from
the
interior
of
the
shed
many
conflicting
thoughts
crowded
his
mind
and
his
impulse
was
to
go
down
and
explore
the
passageway
but
the
severe
cold
made
him
think
better
of
it
and
closing
the
trap
and
replacing
the
hay
he
picked
up
the
tin
container
he
had
come
to
get
and
went
back
to
the
lodge
i
ll
get
my
hat
and
coat
on
and
get
some
of
the
boys
to
go
with
me
he
thought
as
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
went
in
coach
jordan
and
his
helpers
were
nearly
finished
barry
left
the
can
and
went
into
the
living
room
picking
up
his
coat
and
hat
kent
and
the
twins
were
not
around
at
the
time
and
so
barry
slipped
out
of
the
front
door
alone
his
chums
were
in
the
bedroom
attending
to
the
fire
there
i
ll
just
take
a
peek
along
that
corridor
myself
he
decided
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
his
flashlight
and
noting
with
satisfaction
that
it
was
there
then
maybe
i
ll
take
the
whole
crowd
for
a
tour
of
it
providing
it
is
safe
to
do
so
arriving
once
more
in
the
tool
house
he
moved
the
bale
of
hay
aside
and
raised
the
trapdoor
listening
keenly
before
making
a
descent
into
the
newly
found
passage
no
sound
came
to
him
as
he
stood
in
perfect
silence
and
at
last
thinking
that
it
was
safe
to
proceed
he
turned
on
the
beam
of
his
light
and
carefully
walked
down
the
steps
there
were
seven
steps
and
when
he
reached
the
bottom
he
turned
the
light
down
the
tunnel
he
had
closed
the
door
of
the
opening
and
now
stood
alone
under
the
earth
the
passage
was
long
and
sloped
away
farther
than
the
shaft
of
light
would
reveal
with
a
rapidly
beating
heart
he
began
to
advance
walking
slowly
and
quietly
his
eyes
alert
and
his
nerves
drawn
tight
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
was
drawing
farther
and
farther
away
from
his
companions
and
that
he
ought
to
go
back
and
get
some
of
them
but
the
impulse
to
go
on
was
too
strong
and
he
kept
advancing
the
tunnel
was
well
made
he
was
able
to
walk
upright
and
had
to
bend
low
only
at
one
place
where
a
tree
root
broke
through
and
crossed
the
underground
way
it
was
a
dry
place
and
not
very
cold
the
sides
of
the
tunnel
had
been
carefully
cut
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
had
been
built
for
some
definite
purpose
but
what
can
it
be
for
he
wondered
does
morganson
know
that
it
is
here
maybe
i
ll
know
more
about
it
all
when
i
get
to
the
the
end
was
near
he
could
see
some
boards
before
him
and
a
few
moments
later
he
stopped
playing
the
beam
of
the
light
against
the
boards
that
closed
the
tunnel
they
seemed
to
be
fairly
new
ones
and
they
simply
fitted
into
the
soil
he
put
out
his
hand
to
push
against
them
and
then
thought
better
of
it
pausing
to
listen
once
more
his
flashlight
out
the
blackness
seemed
to
crush
in
on
him
no
telling
what
is
on
the
other
side
of
that
boarding
if
i
can
t
push
it
open
i
ll
go
back
and
get
the
no
sound
came
to
him
and
so
he
again
turned
on
the
light
and
then
pushed
against
the
partition
to
his
astonishment
it
turned
outward
like
a
door
and
his
light
showed
him
the
interior
of
a
small
shed
stepping
through
and
closing
the
boards
after
him
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
on
hinges
and
formed
part
of
the
wall
of
the
small
building
in
which
he
found
himself
there
were
two
windows
and
a
door
to
the
place
but
otherwise
the
interior
was
perfectly
bare
a
conviction
came
to
him
by
george
this
is
the
quarry
shed
where
kent
and
i
saw
the
man
with
the
black
gloves
go
in
no
wonder
no
one
answered
our
knocks
and
kicks
the
man
had
gone
up
the
tunnel
to
the
lodge
and
when
we
got
over
that
way
we
saw
him
run
into
the
tool
house
i
m
learning
so
much
that
it
makes
me
dizzy
he
opened
the
door
of
the
quarry
shed
and
stepped
out
the
wind
coming
in
from
a
break
in
the
rock
wall
had
swept
the
snow
away
from
the
door
and
the
ground
was
hard
and
the
snow
at
that
particular
place
he
closed
the
door
and
looked
around
it
was
much
the
same
as
it
had
been
the
night
he
and
kent
had
stood
there
demanding
shelter
except
that
the
snow
was
not
driving
he
wondered
where
the
black
shadow
came
from
and
he
began
to
wander
toward
the
far
end
of
the
quarry
for
a
while
he
did
not
use
his
light
and
it
was
not
until
he
was
at
the
very
base
of
the
quarry
wall
that
he
flashed
the
light
around
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
no
house
or
anything
down
at
this
end
he
reflected
turning
i
d
better
go
the
other
then
his
eyes
fell
on
a
figure
crossing
the
bowl
of
the
quarry
and
instinctively
he
crouched
down
it
was
the
same
figure
that
they
had
seen
once
before
and
the
man
went
boldly
into
the
quarry
shed
barry
watched
him
with
wildly
beating
heart
there
he
goes
now
he
breathed
on
his
way
to
the
lodge
to
start
something
i
ll
bet
and
as
sure
as
i
m
a
foot
high
he
ll
discover
that
someone
has
been
in
his
tunnel
then
what
will
happen
chapter
xxiii
the
raiders
the
boys
who
remained
in
the
kitchen
helping
coach
jordan
with
the
dishes
were
not
long
in
finishing
the
job
kent
and
the
coach
did
the
washing
and
as
fast
as
they
turned
out
the
dripping
steaming
plates
the
other
boys
snatched
them
up
and
dried
them
there
was
a
lot
of
fun
about
it
all
and
it
was
plainly
to
be
seen
that
the
boys
from
cloverfield
were
enjoying
the
whole
trip
coach
jordan
kept
them
interested
by
his
description
of
his
travels
and
experiences
and
at
the
time
that
barry
left
the
room
on
his
way
to
the
tool
house
he
was
telling
of
the
days
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
great
fordson
camp
in
the
mountains
of
kentucky
his
account
of
the
and
in
the
dense
timber
of
the
southern
upland
was
of
great
interest
to
the
boys
and
they
laughed
heartily
at
some
of
the
rough
experiences
that
he
had
encountered
while
staying
in
mountain
log
cabins
and
having
to
get
up
at
three
o
clock
and
shave
with
well
water
on
frosty
mornings
he
told
them
of
the
great
salt
kettles
rusting
away
in
the
mud
of
the
little
town
that
was
at
the
time
the
shipping
point
for
the
ford
lumber
and
coal
a
town
which
had
at
one
time
supplied
all
of
the
state
with
salt
the
boys
listened
with
great
attention
what
s
the
difference
between
those
mountains
and
these
tom
bailey
asked
these
mountains
are
pretty
well
known
the
coach
replied
the
people
in
them
have
been
in
contact
with
civilization
for
a
long
time
and
tourist
and
the
summer
camper
have
come
into
them
frequently
but
in
the
kentucky
mountains
we
find
an
arrested
civilization
and
by
that
i
mean
that
people
poured
into
its
hollows
and
gaps
and
then
progress
jumped
clear
over
them
and
kept
going
west
while
the
mountaineer
remained
the
same
as
he
had
been
in
the
time
of
the
revolution
i
have
frequently
seen
old
mountain
women
working
the
spinning
wheel
and
many
of
them
smoke
a
pipe
all
the
kent
had
finished
his
work
and
after
drying
his
hands
he
went
into
the
nearest
bedroom
to
see
how
the
fire
was
finding
that
it
needed
coal
he
seized
a
bucket
and
flashlight
and
went
out
to
get
some
when
he
returned
he
met
the
twins
in
the
hall
here
you
are
mac
exclaimed
we
were
wondering
what
had
become
of
just
lugging
in
some
coal
kent
explained
he
entered
the
bedroom
and
began
to
fix
the
fire
what
are
the
girls
doing
they
have
toasted
some
marshmallows
that
melt
right
in
your
mouth
tim

i

to
the
tool
house
to
get
a
pail

in
a
low
tone
i

we
are
going
to
keep
our
ears
and
eyes

told
him

want
to
be
on
the
job
well
let
s
get
back
in
the
living
they
found
all
the
young
people
gathered
around
the
fire
and
coach
jordan
and
bill
jefferson
were
taking
off
their
hats
and
coats
we
put
the
horses
in
the
barn
the
coach
explained
then
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
held
them
close
to
the
fire
after
being
out
there
this
heat
feels
kent
and
the
twins
looked
around
the
room
anybody
seen
barry
kent
asked
everyone
looked
around
and
then
one
by
one
they
shook
their
heads
he
brought
that
pail
in
and
then
left
the
kitchen
charlie
announced
he
came
in
here
and
took
his
hat
and
coat
one
of
the
girls
remarked
then
he
went
out
into
that
hall
toward
the
front
the
twins
exchanged
troubled
glances
and
kent
glanced
involuntarily
at
pearl
who
looked
suddenly
alarmed
too
bad
pearl
knows
anything
about
this
place
kent
thought
but
he
spoke
carelessly
oh
well
he
ll
be
right
back
let
s
have
some
of
those
marshmallows
what
happened
to
those
black
ones
fell

the
fire
jennie
morrison
explained
but
they
ll
taste
just
as
good
as
the
others
they
are
just
like
some
people
rough
outside
and
sweet
inside
jennie
is
becoming
quite
a
philosopher
laughed
jordan
tell
us
some
more
the
girl
laughed
i
can
toast
marshmallows
better
than
i
can
give
you
philosophy
she
said
the
talking
went
on
in
a
way
but
not
all
of
them
were
joining
in
it
the
three
mystery
hunters
were
quiet
and
pearl
frequently
looked
at
mac
and
she
was
plainly
uneasy
finally
mac
leaned
over
to
tim
listen
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
things
he
whispered
barry
has
been
gone
a
long
time
suppose
you
go
into
the
kitchen
and
look
around
if
you
don
t
see
anything
i
ll
go
out
on
the
front
what
excuse
will
i
give
for
going
out
tim
asked
you
don
t
there
isn
t
any
water
in
here
and
there
is
some
in
the
kitchen
go
tim
nodded
and
got
up
from
the
footstool
upon
which
he
had
been
sitting
these
marshmallows
are
powerful
sweet
he
smiled
i
m
going
to
get
a
pitcher
of
water
and
some
that
s
a
good
idea
the
coach
approved
tim
took
his
flashlight
and
hurried
to
the
kitchen
they
had
brought
some
large
containers
of
drinking
water
with
them
and
just
now
this
afforded
him
a
convenient
excuse
for
leaving
but
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
the
kitchen
he
put
out
the
light
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
back
door
he
turned
the
key
and
looked
out
all
was
quiet
and
no
one
was
around
he
walked
out
on
the
porch
and
looked
around
the
open
clearing
the
night
was
fairly
dark
but
because
of
the
bright
blanket
of
snow
he
was
able
to
make
out
objects
barry
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
tim
returned
to
the
house
locked
the
kitchen
door
and
proceeded
to
pour
some
water
in
a
pitcher
by
the
light
of
his
flash
when
he
had
obtained
some
glasses
he
went
back
to
the
living
room
jordan
was
reciting
a
humorous
poem
and
most
of
them
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
tim
as
he
came
back
but
pearl
scanned
his
averted
face
anxiously
and
saw
at
once
that
he
had
not
found
her
brother
mac
and
kent
read
the
same
answer
nothing
was
said
and
at
last
mac
began
to
work
his
way
toward
the
hall
door
tim
had
passed
him
the
flashlight
and
with
this
in
his
back
pocket
he
gradually
moved
over
to
the
door
that
led
into
the
front
room
while
the
others
were
busy
laughing
at
a
joke
that
charlie
had
told
mac
slipped
out
of
the
door
few
of
them
saw
him
go
and
no
one
asked
any
questions
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
big
square
hall
mac
turned
on
the
beam
of
the
light
and
hastily
played
it
all
around
the
place
barry
was
not
there
and
for
a
moment
mac
trained
the
light
on
the
stairs
leading
to
the
loft
he
wondered
if
his
chum
had
gone
up
there
but
at
last
he
shook
his
head
the
popular
leader
of
cloverfield
high
school
had
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
that
clearly
indicated
that
he
had
gone
for
a
moment
mac
hesitated
he
was
not
prepared
to
go
out
into
the
snow
and
to
go
back
and
get
his
outer
clothing
would
excite
suspicion
at
once
and
yet
he
reflected
the
bunch
is
soon
going
to
know
that
barry
has
disappeared
if
he
doesn
t
get
back
soon
we
ll
have
to
go
and
look
for
him
we
can
t
fool
them
much
longer
pearl
is
getting
more
and
more
uneasy
every
minute
hang
it
all
maybe
we
re
wasting
valuable
time
i
ll
look
outside
and
if
i
don
t
see
him
i
m
going
back
and
get
my
hat
and
coat
and
go
out
and
hunt
for
he
stepped
out
onto
the
front
porch
and
walked
to
the
edge
looking
around
toward
the
back
of
the
lodge
no
one
was
in
sight
and
then
he
glanced
out
over
the
lake
dim
in
the
light
of
the
stars
and
the
white
border
of
the
dark
timbered
sides
at
once
his
eyes
narrowed
as
he
saw
signs
of
movement
on
the
ice
sheet
of
the
lake
something
bulky
and
black
shot
out
onto
the
ice
and
two
figures
leaped
from
it
and
began
to
push
it
ahead
of
them
as
mac
stared
without
comprehension
another
bulky
object
shot
out
from
the
bank
onto
the
ice
the
ford
boy
gasped
and
clenched
his
fists
our
sleighs
somebody
is
shoving
them
out
onto
the
lake
of
all
a
voice
and
yet
penetrating
reached
him
coming
in
from
the
lake
don
t
send
the
other
one
down
until
i
tell
you
i
want
to
get
this
one
out
of
the
way
first
a
great
light
dawned
upon
mac
carter
wolf
and
his
gang
he
breathed
as
he
turned
and
raced
softly
back
to
the
front
door
running
off
with
our
sleighs
going
to
hide
them
so
we
ll
have
to
hike
home
we
ve
got
to
put
a
stop
to
that
throwing
all
caution
to
the
winds
the
twin
rushed
through
the
hall
and
flung
himself
into
the
living
room
startling
them
all
and
very
nearly
knocking
one
girl
over
his
staring
eyes
and
excited
manner
alarmed
them
all
and
caused
particular
apprehension
on
the
part
of
those
who
knew
anything
about
the
history
of
bluff
lodge
listen
he
said
before
anyone
could
speak
somebody
is
pushing
our
sleighs
out
on
the
ice
and
taking
them
off
to
hide
them
i
m
sure
it
is
carter
wolf
and
his
bunch
if
we
don
t
want
to
walk
home
tomorrow
we
d
better
get
out
there
in
a
big
hurry
a
medley
of
cries
of
surprise
and
indignation
came
in
answer
to
his
rapid
announcement
and
everyone
sprang
up
in
consternation
coach
jordan
seized
his
coat
and
hat
come
on
boys
he
cried
we
ll
have
something
to
say
about
this
he
turned
to
his
wife
you
take
care
of
the
girls
dorothy
better
not
go
out
the
boys
were
ready
and
like
a
pack
of
hornets
they
dashed
out
of
the
front
door
on
the
heels
of
coach
jordan
kent
sprinted
in
the
lead
because
he
knew
the
country
better
and
he
led
them
across
the
clearing
toward
the
bronson
cabin
they
had
left
the
sleds
in
front
of
that
building
when
they
had
tied
the
horses
to
the
rail
all
of
the
sleighs
were
gone
and
mac
led
them
down
the
slope
toward
where
he
had
seen
the
sleighs
slide
out
on
the
ice
they
expected
to
find
the
vehicles
scattered
and
the
raiders
gone
but
to
their
astonishment
they
heard
voices
and
saw
a
dark
mass
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
shore
keep
his
head
above
water
a
voice
cried
out
we
ll
try
to
pull
this
sleigh
out
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
carter
me
out
a
voice
gasped
i
told
you
not
to
let
that
sleigh
go
until
i
told
you
to
by
this
time
the
boys
and
the
coach
had
arrived
on
the
spot
and
mac
s
flashlight
showed
the
scene
before
them
one
of
the
sleighs
was
turned
sideways
and
another
had
run
into
it
and
was
partly
sunk
under
the
ice
caught
under
a
runner
and
immersed
in
water
to
his
chin
was
carter
wolf
the
sleigh
had
broken
the
ice
and
he
had
gone
in
with
a
splash
the
sleigh
runner
had
pushed
in
on
top
of
him
and
was
pressing
against
his
chest
while
his
five
friends
worked
frantically
to
hold
his
head
above
water
and
at
the
same
time
to
pull
the
winter
conveyance
back
out
of
the
break
in
the
ice
what
happened
here
the
coach
cried
as
they
took
in
the
scene
these
let
a
sleigh
come
down
the
hill
i
had
moved
the
other
one
out
of
the
way
wolf
answered
with
chattering
teeth
the
ice
was
thin
here
in
his
effort
to
talk
he
slipped
slightly
and
swallowed
some
icy
water
keep
perfectly
still
the
athletic
coach
commanded
we
ll
get
you
he
lay
down
flat
on
the
ice
and
passed
his
gloved
hands
under
wolf
s
armpits
feeling
the
shock
of
the
cold
water
it
was
a
position
of
extreme
peril
for
coach
jordan
if
the
ice
broke
away
but
he
did
not
allow
his
mind
to
dwell
on
the
thought
now
the
rest
of
you
boys
draw
that
sleigh
up
out
of
the
the
girls
had
followed
and
now
stood
on
the
shore
silent
except
for
a
few
exclamations
their
faces
white
as
they
saw
what
had
happened
mac
sprang
up
the
bank
and
pressed
his
flashlight
into
jordan
s
hand
keep
this
trained
on
us
please
he
requested
and
then
he
was
back
with
the
others
lending
a
hand
the
sleigh
was
a
big
one
and
had
considerable
weight
to
it
but
by
their
united
efforts
they
managed
to
move
it
backward
coach
jordan
had
considered
using
some
of
the
horses
but
time
was
pressing
and
he
knew
that
wolf
must
be
rescued
as
soon
as
possible
the
boys
pulled
and
tugged
steadily
and
the
sleigh
was
finally
drawn
up
on
the
bank
and
off
of
the
ice
now
two
of
you
come
here
the
coach
called
only
two
and
come
around
in
a
circle
back
of
me
so
as
not
to
put
too
great
a
strain
on
the
ice
two
of
wolf
s
companions
quickly
and
carefully
circled
around
the
gaping
hole
and
made
their
way
to
the
coach
his
friends
were
quiet
and
obviously
frightened
by
the
recent
events
also
they
were
quite
willing
to
help
and
although
somewhat
afraid
to
trust
the
ice
they
knelt
beside
the
athletic
instructor
and
helped
him
lift
carter
wolf
out
of
the
icy
waters
of
lake
arrowtip
two
of
you
boys
race
to
the
lodge
and
get
some
blankets
jordan
directed
tim
started
on
the
jump
come
on
mac
he
cried
and
his
brother
joined
him
at
once
kent
watched
them
run
up
the
slope
toward
the
lodge
and
then
turned
to
look
on
as
coach
jordan
and
wolf
s
two
friends
guided
him
as
he
stumbled
toward
the
shore
this
business
is
over
with
and
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
on
that
score
kent
thought
but
barry
is
still
missing
and
if
all
this
excitement
didn
t
bring
him
back
there
is
something
decidedly
wrong
chapter
xxiv
at
grips
with
the
black
shadow
unconscious
of
the
events
at
the
lodge
barry
crouched
in
the
snow
at
the
base
of
the
quarry
wall
and
gazed
in
the
direction
of
the
shed
into
which
the
figure
in
black
had
disappeared
his
whole
plan
of
action
had
to
be
changed
and
for
the
time
being
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
had
planned
to
return
to
the
tool
house
by
way
of
the
tunnel
and
tell
his
friends
what
he
had
discovered
but
now
it
was
highly
dangerous
to
go
back
that
way
the
bale
of
hay
sort
of
slides
down
on
the
trapdoor
when
you
pull
it
down
he
thought
perhaps
he
won
t
find
out
that
someone
has
been
in
the
passageway
i
m
glad
i
closed
all
doors
and
walls
behind
me
but
there
may
be
footprints
or
something
else
to
give
me
away
gosh
this
is
a
tough
situation
the
man
in
black
was
undoubtedly
going
to
the
lodge
to
start
his
series
of
annoyances
and
barry
knew
that
these
things
would
frighten
the
girls
besides
preventing
that
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
to
take
this
prowler
a
captive
and
if
it
was
not
done
tonight
it
might
never
be
done
he
fairly
groaned
as
he
saw
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
the
boys
may
not
get
him
and
if
we
lose
him
this
time
we
re
sunk
if
i
had
my
hunting
rifle
i
d
go
back
along
the
tunnel
and
call
on
him
to
surrender
but
i
haven
t
a
thing
and
i
imagine
that
the
man
is
armed
or
at
least
able
to
put
up
a
good
fight
it
would
be
suicide
to
follow
him
through
the
passageway
but
i
must
get
back
there
were
just
two
ways
open
to
him
through
the
underground
tunnel
or
by
way
of
the
woods
of
course
the
secret
passage
was
the
quickest
route
but
it
was
also
the
most
dangerous
barry
decided
not
to
risk
it
it
will
take
me
a
little
longer
to
dash
through
the
woods
but
it
will
be
a
heap
safer
he
reflected
if
i
went
through
the
tunnel
and
met
the
spook
face
to
face
i
d
never
be
able
to
get
away
and
i
ve
simply
got
to
get
back
and
warn
the
people
at
the
lodge
rising
from
his
stooping
position
barry
began
to
run
toward
the
shed
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
having
to
pass
it
for
the
man
might
have
found
out
that
someone
had
been
in
the
passage
and
might
have
returned
to
investigate
the
vicinity
of
the
quarry
there
was
a
chance
that
the
black
shadow
might
step
out
of
the
shed
just
as
he
passed
and
if
that
happened
things
would
not
be
well
for
the
boy
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
sprinted
past
glancing
sideways
in
some
alarm
and
ready
to
increase
his
speed
if
need
be
the
door
of
the
shed
however
remained
closed
and
no
one
challenged
him
as
he
sped
past
good
luck
he
exulted
as
he
left
the
quarry
and
plunged
into
the
woods
i
made
that
all
right
and
now
if
i
can
get
to
the
lodge
just
about
as
soon
as
he
does
everything
will
be
all
he
did
not
take
the
exact
path
that
he
and
kent
had
taken
on
the
night
of
the
big
storm
since
they
had
gone
in
a
roundabout
way
but
relying
on
chance
he
cut
across
the
timber
belt
in
a
straight
line
hoping
that
he
was
not
making
any
mistake
running
was
not
easy
because
the
snow
was
loose
and
the
under
snow
had
melted
and
then
frozen
again
making
slippery
footing
occasionally
his
foot
hit
the
root
of
a
tree
or
a
stone
and
once
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
only
saved
himself
from
a
complete
fall
by
his
outflung
hands
but
he
struggled
on
determined
to
reach
the
ones
in
the
lodge
as
soon
as
possible
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
trees
he
saw
the
man
in
black
sneaking
from
the
tool
house
toward
the
rear
porch
of
the
lodge
at
the
same
time
something
happened
that
caused
the
black
shadow
to
stop
and
flatten
himself
against
the
wall
of
the
house
and
made
barry
halt
in
his
run
there
was
a
sudden
stir
and
some
shouts
and
then
coach
jordan
and
the
other
boys
came
running
across
the
porch
and
jumped
into
the
snow
watching
with
bewildered
eyes
barry
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
had
somehow
discovered
the
presence
of
the
black
shadow
but
they
did
not
come
along
the
side
of
the
lodge
building
but
dashed
across
the
snow
in
the
direction
of
the
bronson
cabin
barry
followed
them
with
his
eyes
and
then
he
noticed
that
the
sleighs
were
gone
the
situation
began
to
dawn
upon
him
somebody
has
taken
the
sleighs
and
the
boys
are
after
them
carter
wolf
said
he
was
going
to
do
something
to
break
up
our
party
and
i
guess
he
ll
do
it
in
one
way
or
another
some
of
those
sleighs
are
borrowed
and
i
hope
they
don
t
smash
them
up
in
any
he
wondered
what
the
man
in
black
would
do
and
once
more
looked
in
his
direction
the
prowler
had
been
as
completely
surprised
as
barry
had
been
and
while
the
boys
were
running
he
remained
perfectly
still
pressed
close
against
the
wall
but
now
he
had
glided
in
swift
retreat
to
the
back
porch
which
afforded
more
shelter
there
was
another
exodus
from
the
lodge
as
the
girls
followed
the
boys
accompanied
by
the
leaping
barking
castor
oil
jennie
had
been
feeding
him
marshmallows
and
he
was
completely
her
slave
so
much
so
that
when
charlie
had
run
out
his
clumsy
animal
companion
had
watched
him
go
without
any
desire
to
follow
him
he
was
content
to
run
with
the
girls
dashing
and
barking
in
a
wild
display
of
good
spirits
barry
could
hear
the
girls
talking
and
he
watched
them
disappear
down
the
slope
that
led
from
the
front
of
the
bronson
cabin
to
the
lake
something
had
happened
down
there
and
he
was
anxious
to
know
what
it
was
but
his
duty
now
was
to
watch
the
man
who
had
taken
refuge
on
the
back
porch
of
the
hunting
lodge
no
doubt
his
plans
had
been
upset
as
had
barry
s
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
what
he
would
do
under
the
circumstances
would
he
beat
a
retreat
down
the
passageway
and
be
lost
to
them
barry
wondered
of
course
if
the
man
did
it
would
be
much
safer
for
them
simply
to
get
some
officers
of
the
law
up
there
and
try
and
trace
the
tunnel
and
find
out
where
the
man
lived
but
the
thought
did
not
satisfy
him
he
wanted
to
catch
the
prowler
on
the
spot
so
that
he
would
have
no
loophole
through
which
to
escape
when
accused
of
causing
the
disturbances
at
bluff
lodge
perhaps
the
shadow
would
go
back
into
the
tool
house
and
wait
until
they
got
back
so
as
to
produce
rappings
and
noises
if
this
was
his
program
barry
felt
sure
that
he
could
tackle
the
man
on
the
spot
and
hold
him
until
help
arrived
but
he
would
want
that
help
to
be
pretty
near
at
the
time
no
doubt
the
prowler
was
armed
as
anyone
engaged
in
a
desperate
business
was
likely
to
be
unless
he
had
scorned
to
go
armed
against
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
barry
was
not
left
long
in
doubt
the
man
had
hesitated
because
he
had
been
doing
some
rapid
thinking
and
at
last
he
had
made
up
his
mind
leaving
the
back
porch
he
ran
hastily
to
the
window
and
peered
in
then
he
bent
low
to
escape
the
light
from
the
fire
and
the
lamps
and
passed
on
to
the
front
where
he
crossed
the
porch
and
entered
the
front
door
barry
guessed
his
intention
at
once
the
boys
and
girls
had
run
out
and
left
many
things
behind
them
among
other
things
some
fairly
good
coats
and
the
pocketbooks
of
the
girls
were
on
the
table
the
black
shadow
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
them
and
get
away
and
perhaps
to
come
back
with
his
knocking
pranks
later
on
knowing
the
lodge
as
well
as
he
seemed
to
he
would
no
doubt
go
out
the
back
as
they
came
in
the
front
fate
had
put
him
in
position
to
make
a
daring
and
completely
successful
raid
barry
lost
no
time
running
his
best
he
left
the
timber
and
cut
on
a
straight
line
for
the
lodge
he
did
not
know
what
the
boys
were
doing
down
there
at
the
lake
and
he
had
no
time
to
go
and
find
out
it
was
his
supreme
chance
and
he
had
the
feeling
that
if
he
lost
out
now
the
ghostly
prowler
of
bluff
lodge
would
never
be
captured
he
leaped
to
the
porch
and
ran
across
it
into
the
dark
hall
and
finally
jerked
the
door
to
the
living
room
open
blinking
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
as
his
eyes
swept
the
interior
of
the
place
the
tall
man
in
the
black
overcoat
hat
and
gloves
whirled
at
the
sound
of
his
coming
and
turned
two
burning
dark
eyes
upon
him
but
if
barry
expected
to
see
his
face
he
was
disappointed
a
black
handkerchief
obscured
all
of
it
except
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
glare
out
above
the
covering
he
had
been
feverishly
picking
up
coats
hats
and
pocketbooks
and
was
in
the
act
of
taking
a
fur
piece
belonging
to
jordan
when
barry
burst
into
the
room
as
the
boy
faced
him
with
resolute
though
pale
face
the
man
pointed
a
finger
at
him
get
out
of
here
boy
he
cried
hoarsely
get
out
or
you
ll
wish
you
had
barry
had
made
up
his
mind
on
the
way
that
talking
would
be
a
waste
of
time
from
the
moment
that
he
had
opened
the
door
he
was
preparing
for
the
struggle
that
was
sure
to
come
he
had
opened
his
mackinaw
coat
while
running
and
now
he
dropped
it
to
the
floor
behind
him
then
even
while
the
man
was
pointing
at
him
he
leaped
across
the
floor
at
the
figure
he
was
tense
and
his
throat
was
dry
as
he
closed
in
on
the
intruder
his
great
fear
was
that
the
man
would
draw
a
weapon
and
shoot
him
down
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
he
had
engaged
the
man
at
exactly
the
right
time
the
outlaw
had
his
arms
full
of
coats
and
other
things
and
as
barry
grappled
with
him
he
was
vainly
trying
to
shake
a
pocketbook
loose
the
chain
of
which
had
become
twisted
around
his
middle
finger
on
his
right
hand
this
incident
small
as
it
was
gave
barry
a
fighting
chance
his
arms
went
around
the
man
and
with
a
twist
the
boy
swept
his
adversary
off
his
feet
they
went
down
with
a
resounding
crash
to
the
floor
and
the
black
hat
rolled
off
revealing
a
rather
head
with
a
high
forehead
the
black
eyes
seemed
to
look
into
barry
s
face
for
an
instant
in
surprise
then
their
expression
turned
to
one
of
deadly
hate
and
the
battle
was
on
only
for
a
moment
did
the
man
accept
his
quick
overthrow
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
was
fighting
like
a
tiger
snarling
exceedingly
bad
language
as
his
eyes
seemed
to
shoot
out
fire
barry
felt
the
muscles
under
the
long
black
overcoat
stiffen
and
become
like
steel
and
the
fingers
that
began
to
creep
and
grope
for
his
throat
were
wiry
and
powerful
reaching
for
one
of
the
man
s
hands
barry
was
tossed
forward
and
his
arm
brushed
the
black
handkerchief
from
his
face
only
for
an
instant
did
he
see
the
features
of
his
enemy
the
man
was
about
forty
years
old
with
a
thin
face
and
small
mustache
just
now
the
veins
on
his
forehead
stood
out
and
his
teeth
showed
slightly
as
he
exerted
himself
to
overcome
the
mystery
hunter
the
man
launched
a
blow
at
barry
which
caught
him
off
guard
and
caused
him
to
pause
in
his
efforts
to
pin
down
the
hands
of
the
prowler
the
fist
of
the
stranger
landed
just
under
barry
s
chin
and
in
the
pain
and
surprise
of
it
the
boy
hesitated
this
was
just
what
the
man
was
waiting
for
his
long
thin
legs
came
up
one
of
them
hooked
over
barry
s
neck
and
a
mighty
tug
sent
the
boy
tumbling
backward
before
the
young
mystery
hunter
could
recover
the
black
shadow
was
upon
him
and
strong
fingers
had
gripped
his
throat
cutting
off
his
wind
instantly
sudden
fire
and
aching
pain
shot
through
the
boy
from
cloverfield
this
is
the
end
flashed
through
his
bewildered
mind
i
m
completely
beaten
at
that
moment
the
twins
came
running
in
to
get
a
blanket
for
carter
wolf
they
paused
on
the
threshold
and
stared
at
the
scene
before
them
incredulously
chapter
xxv
the
mystery
of
the
lodge
the
ford
boys
stood
in
the
doorway
and
gazed
at
the
unexpected
sight
before
them
like
persons
in
a
daze
the
fingers
of
the
man
were
clutching
barry
s
throat
and
one
knee
was
planted
with
crushing
force
on
his
chest
the
face
which
the
stranger
turned
toward
the
twins
was
dark
with
rage
and
exertion
and
his
black
eyes
were
fierce
and
defiant
so
utterly
unexpected
was
this
scene
to
the
two
newcomers
that
they
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
until
a
choking
cry
burst
from
barry
who
was
looking
at
them
imploringly
then
mac
suddenly
came
to
life
and
a
growl
of
anger
burst
from
him
come
on
tim
he
shouted
this
man
is
killing
barry
keep
off
snarled
the
man
half
turning
to
face
them
i
m
going
away
from
here
and
nobody
is
going
to
stop
me
keep
away
or
i
the
last
part
of
his
sentence
was
never
finished
mac
hurled
himself
on
the
stranger
jerking
his
hands
away
from
barry
s
throat
tim
joined
him
with
vigor
and
they
fairly
tore
him
off
of
their
chum
he
came
up
with
a
spring
and
wrapped
his
arms
around
the
twins
twisting
them
roughly
in
an
effort
to
break
away
he
realized
that
others
were
coming
and
his
one
desire
now
was
to
thrust
them
aside
and
get
away
but
the
ford
boys
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
go
and
even
barry
weak
and
shaken
as
he
was
returned
to
the
fight
to
keep
the
man
from
escaping
catching
him
around
one
leg
barry
held
him
tightly
while
the
twins
tried
to
break
loose
from
his
iron
grip
at
the
same
time
striving
to
throw
him
back
and
forth
they
swayed
and
struggled
panting
and
straining
the
center
table
was
pushed
to
one
side
and
they
were
up
against
a
wicker
chair
when
the
others
came
back
they
had
been
coming
along
slowly
with
carter
wolf
and
could
not
understand
why
the
twins
did
not
hasten
with
the
blanket
the
lodge
prowler
heard
them
coming
and
the
perspiration
of
a
real
fear
now
stood
out
on
his
head
like
a
wild
animal
trapped
he
looked
around
and
just
as
the
incoming
party
filled
the
doorway
and
gazed
in
wonder
at
the
struggle
he
drew
back
his
free
foot
and
prepared
to
deal
barry
a
kick
that
would
free
the
leg
that
the
boy
was
holding
he
felt
that
if
he
could
once
get
that
leg
loose
he
could
drag
the
twins
into
the
hall
leading
to
the
lodge
kitchen
and
somehow
get
rid
of
them
but
in
raising
his
other
foot
he
lost
his
balance
and
he
and
the
twins
went
down
in
a
crashing
heap
breaking
the
wicker
chair
to
bits
screams
came
from
the
girls
and
the
coach
and
kent
leaped
forward
to
pull
the
combatants
apart
carter
wolf
forgot
his
forlorn
condition
and
his
friends
stared
in
amazement
the
coats
and
pocketbooks
on
the
floor
the
table
back
against
the
wall
and
the
general
signs
of
confusion
put
them
all
at
a
loss
here
what
is
going
on
here
coach
jordan
asked
as
he
hauled
the
twins
off
of
the
fallen
man
but
to
his
astonishment
kent
immediately
threw
himself
on
the
stranger
holding
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him
by
the
wrists
get
a
rope
or
a
curtain
cord
or
something
kent
commanded
and
tim
turned
to
look
for
something
but
at
the
same
moment
the
black
shadow
suddenly
tried
a
dash
for
the
hall
door
instantly
all
four
boys
including
the
bruised
barry
leaped
at
him
and
bore
him
to
the
floor
the
girls
again
screamed
and
the
coach
looked
bewildered
the
captive
addressed
him
call
these
fool
boys
off
jordan
you
know
me
who
is
he
barry
asked
finding
his
voice
hoarse
why
this
is
felix
morganson
nephew
of
the
lady
who
owns
this
lodge
was
the
unexpected
reply
what
cried
the
mystery
hunters
in
chorus
yes
i
am
and
when
my
aunt
hears
of
this
you
ll
hear
a
thing
or
two
said
felix
morganson
but
the
boys
were
not
at
all
worried
that
s
all
right
said
kent
warmly
but
you
are
the
ghost
of
this
haunted
yes
he
is
nodded
barry
i
saw
him
come
up
here
through
a
secret
underground
tunnel
and
when
i
arrived
on
the
scene
in
this
room
he
was
stealing
our
coats
and
everything
else
in
that
s
a
lie
denied
the
prisoner
his
keen
eyes
shifting
around
it
isn
t
and
if
we
hadn
t
come
along
when
we
did
you
would
have
just
about
killed
barry
mac
declared
by
this
time
tim
had
found
a
rope
and
kent
took
it
and
tried
to
tie
the
wrists
of
the
prisoner
behind
him
felix
morganson
looked
at
the
coach
jordan
are
you
going
to
stand
for
this
he
shouted
somebody
will
get
into
big
trouble
and
you
are
in
charge
of
these
boys
the
coach
hesitated
plainly
at
a
loss
and
barry
quickly
took
command
of
the
situation
it
s
all
right
jordan
and
i
will
assume
full
responsibility
my
father
has
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
find
the
man
who
has
been
giving
this
lodge
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
morganson
is
the
one
who
did
the
rapping
and
thumping
we
must
not
let
him
get
before
the
athletic
director
could
speak
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
of
the
lodge
they
looked
at
one
another
with
wondering
glances
and
then
charlie
black
hurried
to
the
door
one
of
the
girls
swiftly
wrapped
a
blanket
around
carter
wolf
and
pushed
him
over
in
front
of
the
fire
kent
and
barry
kept
their
eyes
on
morganson
charlie
returned
with
strange
companions
two
men
with
police
stars
on
their
coats
came
in
driving
the
french
couple
before
them
one
of
the
men
held
the
frenchman
s
gun
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
pierre
and
his
wife
looked
sullen
evening
folks
nodded
the
stouter
of
the
two
men
i
m
sheriff
paulson
and
this
is
mchenry
we
ve
been
keepin
watch
on
these
frenchies
for
a
few
days
and
just
now
they
was
outside
of
this
window
gettin
ready
to
shoot
the
lamps
he
looked
at
felix
morganson
with
interest
so
here
you
are
morganson
you
ain
t
in
canada
or
south
america
i
think
he
s
been
here
all
along
sheriff
barry
spoke
up
i
found
a
secret
tunnel
from
that
quarry
over
there
to
the
tool
house
out
back
he
is
the
one
who
has
been
giving
the
place
a
bad
found
a
tunnel
did
you
the
sheriff
asked
looking
at
barry
with
interest
there
used
to
be
some
counterfeiters
operating
around
here
in
an
old
cabin
that
stood
where
this
lodge
is
and
i
guess
they
was
the
ones
used
it
so
morganson
has
been
hauntin
his
own
aunt
s
property
these
frenchies
have
been
helpin
him
right
along
and
i
guess
squeezin
plenty
of
money
out
of
barry
suddenly
remembered
something
which
one
of
you
shot
at
wolf
and
his
friends
the
night
they
sat
on
the
front
porch
he
asked
i
try
scare
heem
away
the
frenchman
admitted
after
some
further
conversation
the
sheriff
agreed
to
take
morganson
to
his
aunt
in
cloverfield
the
ghost
of
the
lodge
insisted
upon
seeing
her
and
so
at
last
he
and
his
french
allies
went
off
with
the
two
county
officials
jordan
bill
jefferson
and
tom
bailey
hitched
up
a
sleigh
and
drove
them
to
fox
point
where
the
sheriff
took
morganson
and
the
woodsman
and
his
wife
on
to
cloverfield
in
his
own
conveyance
the
boys
from
rake
island
did
not
stay
long
after
the
sheriff
left
carter
wolf
thanked
everybody
with
averted
eyes
and
went
off
with
his
friends
who
dragged
the
sleighs
back
to
the
lake
bank
before
disappearing
in
the
morning
it
was
an
easy
task
for
the
boys
to
pull
them
on
up
the
slope
and
hitch
up
the
horses
barry
was
somewhat
mussed
up
and
quite
sore
but
he
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
they
sat
around
the
fire
and
listened
with
rapt
attention
while
he
told
of
his
trip
along
the
tunnel
and
when
coach
jordan
and
the
others
came
back
it
had
to
be
told
all
over
again
they
sat
up
until
late
in
the
night
excitedly
discussing
the
events
of
the
evening
but
we
still
do
not
know
why
morganson
pretended
to
be
kidnaped
and
then
hung
around
haunting
the
place
tim
reminded
them
i
have
an
idea
from
some
things
that
he
admitted
to
sheriff
paulson
that
he
did
it
to
knock
down
the
value
of
the
place
and
buy
it
from
his
aunt
for
a
mere
song
spoke
up
the
coach
he
always
had
a
perfect
passion
for
the
lodge
and
was
determined
to
have
it
by
fair
means
or
foul
i
believe
that
he
was
trying
to
buy
it
through
brand
in
this
coach
jordan
was
correct
felix
morganson
had
always
had
a
great
longing
to
own
bluff
lodge
and
with
brand
curry
and
his
french
friends
he
had
planned
to
ruin
the
reputation
of
the
place
and
have
his
friend
buy
it
very
cheaply
until
morganson
died
brand
curry
would
continue
to
own
the
property
as
far
as
outward
appearances
were
concerned
and
then
felix
would
take
it
over
when
his
indulgent
aunt
passed
away
so
he
had
acted
a
false
kidnaping
part
and
had
lived
in
a
small
cabin
down
in
the
hollow
of
a
mountain
spur
close
to
the
abandoned
quarry
with
the
capture
of
felix
morganson
all
mysteries
were
cleared
up
he
was
the
one
who
had
taken
their
sled
and
who
had
dropped
the
snow
behind
the
chimney
upstairs
in
the
hunting
lodge
having
a
key
to
the
lodge
he
entered
it
at
will
the
frenchman
and
his
wife
had
been
writing
to
him
for
money
and
as
he
did
not
send
them
any
they
came
in
person
to
collect
it
and
he
joined
them
at
fox
point
officers
of
the
law
had
become
suspicious
and
had
trailed
the
french
couple
the
young
people
at
the
lodge
were
eager
to
explore
the
counterfeiters
tunnel
that
night
but
barry
persuaded
them
to
wait
until
the
following
day
and
they
finally
consented
early
the
next
morning
they
traversed
it
and
enjoyed
the
experience
when
the
story
finally
got
out
many
came
to
see
it
felix
morganson
had
an
interview
with
his
aunt
and
the
general
opinion
was
that
she
was
too
easy
with
him
for
he
disappeared
shortly
afterward
and
no
charges
of
any
kind
were
ever
placed
against
him
the
french
couple
also
vanished
and
were
never
seen
in
that
part
of
the
country
again
when
the
young
people
from
the
cloverfield
high
school
drove
away
from
bluff
lodge
on
the
morning
after
the
capture
of
the
black
shadow
they
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
an
exciting
and
enjoyable
straw
ride
barry
mac
pearl
and
charlie
rode
on
the
foremost
sleigh
and
kent
and
the
twins
were
directly
behind
them
castor
oil
still
clung
to
the
girl
who
had
satisfied
his
sweet
tooth
now
you
boys
have
certainly
earned
the
name
of
mystery
hunters
pearl
said
as
the
sleigh
glided
on
toward
home
we
re
all
proud
of
mac
grinned
we
ve
passed
our
first
test
in
mysteries
wait
until
the
next
one
comes
along
just
as
the
sleigh
entered
the
timber
barry
turned
to
look
back
at
the
log
building
so
long
old
haunted
lodge
he
smiled
you
are
going
to
be
mighty
lonesome
for
your
