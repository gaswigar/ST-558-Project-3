off
by

when
was
sunk
chapter
i
yon
days
yon
palmy
peaceful
days
i
go
back
to
them
and
they
are
as
a
dream
i
go
back
to
them
again
and
again
and
live
them
over
yon
days
of
another
age
the
age
of
peace
when
no
man
dared
even
to
dream
of
such
times
as
have
come
upon
us
it
was
in
november
of
and
i
was
setting
forth
upon
a
great
journey
that
was
to
take
me
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
before
i
came
back
again
to
my
wee
hoose
amang
the
heather
at
dunoon
my
wife
was
going
with
me
and
my
tom
valiance
for
they
go
everywhere
with
me
but
my
son
john
was
coming
with
us
only
to
glasgow
and
then
when
we
set
out
for
liverpool
and
the
steamer
that
was
to
bring
us
to
america
he
was
to
go
back
to
cambridge
he
was
near
done
there
the
bonnie
laddie
he
had
taken
his
degree
as
bachelor
of
arts
and
was
to
set
out
soon
upon
a
trip
around
the
world
was
that
no
a
fine
plan
i
had
made
for
my
son
that
great
voyage
he
was
to
have
to
see
the
world
and
all
its
peoples
it
was
proud
i
was
that
i
could
give
it
to
him
he
was
but
it
may
be
i
tell
you
more
of
john
later
in
this
book
my
pen
runs
awa
with
me
and
my
tongue
too
when
i
think
of
my
boy
john
we
came
to
the
pier
at
dunoon
and
there
she
lay
the
little
ferry
steamer
the
black
smoke
curling
from
her
stack
straight
up
to
god
ah
the
braw
day
it
was
there
was
a
frosty
sheen
upon
the
heather
and
the
clyde
was
calm
as
glass
the
tops
of
the
hills
were
coated
with
snow
and
they
stood
out
against
the
horizon
like
great
big
sugar
loaves
we
were
a
happy
that
day
there
was
a
crowd
to
see
us
off
they
had
come
to
bid
me
farewell
and
godspeed
all
my
friends
and
my
relations
and
i
went
among
them
shaking
them
by
the
hand
and
thinking
of
the
long
whiles
before
i
be
seeing
them
again
and
then
all
my
goodbys
were
said
and
we
went
aboard
and
my
voyage
had
begun
i
looked
back
at
the
hills
and
the
heather
and
i
thought
of
all
i
was
to
do
and
see
before
i
saw
those
hills
again
i
was
going
half
way
round
the
world
and
back
again
i
was
going
to
wonderful
places
to
see
wonderful
things
and
curious
faces
but
oftenest
the
thought
came
to
me
as
i
looked
at
my
son
that
him
i
would
see
again
before
i
saw
the
heather
and
the
hills
and
all
the
friends
and
the
relations
i
was
leaving
behind
me
for
on
his
trip
around
the
world
he
was
to
meet
us
in
australia
it
was
easier
to
leave
him
easier
to
set
out
knowing
that
thinking
of
that
wonderful
places
i
went
to
surely
and
wonderful
things
i
saw
and
heard
but
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
that
i
was
to
see
or
hear
upon
that
voyage
i
did
not
dream
of
nor
foresee
how
was
a
mortal
man
to
foresee
how
was
he
to
dream
of
it
could
i
guess
that
the
very
next
time
i
set
out
from
dunoon
pier
the
peaceful
clyde
would
be
dotted
with
patrol
boats
dashing
hither
and
thither
could
i
guess
that
everywhere
there
would
be
boys
in
khaki
and
women
weeping
and
that
my
boy
john
ah
but
i
not
tell
you
of
that
now
peaceful
the
clyde
had
been
and
peaceful
was
the
mersey
when
we
sailed
from
liverpool
for
new
york
i
look
back
on
yon
voyage
the
last
i
took
that
way
in
days
of
peace
next
time
destroyers
to
guard
us
from
the
hun
and
his
submarines
and
to
lay
us
a
safe
course
through
the
mines
and
sailor
boys
about
their
guns
watching
sweeping
the
sea
every
minute
for
the
flash
of
a
sneaking
periscope
showing
for
a
second
above
a
wave
but
then
it
was
a
quiet
trip
with
none
but
the
ups
and
doons
of
every
atlantic
crossing
more
ups
than
doons
i
telling
you
i
was
glad
to
be
in
america
again
glad
to
see
once
more
the
friends
i
made
they
turned
out
to
meet
me
and
to
greet
me
in
new
york
and
as
i
travelled
across
the
continent
to
san
francisco
it
was
the
same
everywhere
i
had
friends
everywhere
they
came
crowding
to
shake
me
by
the
hand
with
a
how
are
you
the
day
harry
it
was
a
long
trip
but
it
was
a
happy
one
how
long
ago
it
seems
now
as
i
write
in
this
new
day
of
war
how
far
away
are
all
the
common
kindly
things
that
then
i
did
not
notice
and
that
now
i
would
give
the
world
and
a
to
have
back
again
then
everywhere
i
went
they
pressed
their
dainties
upon
me
whenever
i
sat
down
for
a
sup
and
a
bite
the
board
groaned
with
plenty
i
was
in
a
rich
country
a
country
where
there
was
enough
for
all
and
to
spare
and
now
as
i
am
writing
i
am
travelling
again
across
america
and
there
is
not
enough
when
i
sit
down
at
table
there
is
a
card
of
herbert
hoover
bidding
me
be
careful
how
i
eat
and
what
i
choose
ay
but
he
has
no
need
to
warn
me
well
i
know
the
truth
and
how
america
is
helping
to
feed
her
allies
over
there
and
so
must
be
sparing
herself
to
think
of
it
in
yon
far
day
the
world
was
all
at
peace
and
now
that
great
america
that
gave
so
little
thought
to
armies
and
to
cannon
is
fighting
with
my
ain
british
against
the
hun
it
was
in
march
of
that
we
sailed
from
san
francisco
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
it
was
a
glorious
day
as
we
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
old
pacific
liner
i
was
eager
and
glad
to
be
off
to
be
sure
america
had
been
kinder
to
me
than
ever
and
i
was
loath
in
a
way
to
be
leaving
her
and
all
the
friends
of
mine
she
held
old
friends
of
years
and
new
ones
made
on
that
trip
but
i
was
coming
back
and
then
there
was
one
great
reason
for
my
eagerness
that
few
folk
knew
that
my
son
john
was
coming
to
meet
me
in
australia
i
was
missing
him
sore
already
they
came
aboard
the
old
tubby
liner
to
see
us
off
friends
by
the
score
they
kept
me
busy
shaking
hands
harry
they
said
and
good
luck
harry
they
cried
and
just
before
the
bugles
sounded
all
ashore
i
heard
a
few
of
them
crooning
an
old
scots
song
will
ye
no
come
back
again
aye
i
come
back
again
i
told
them
when
i
heard
them
good
harry
good
they
cried
back
to
me
it
a
promise
we
be
waiting
for
you
waiting
to
welcome
you
and
so
we
sailed
from
san
francisco
and
from
america
out
through
the
golden
gate
toward
the
sunset
here
was
beauty
for
me
who
loved
it
new
beauty
such
as
i
had
not
seen
before
they
were
quiet
days
happy
days
peaceful
days
i
was
tired
after
my
long
tour
and
the
days
at
sea
rested
me
with
good
talk
when
i
craved
it
and
time
to
sleep
and
no
need
to
give
thought
to
trains
or
to
think
when
i
went
to
bed
that
in
the
night
they
rouse
me
from
my
sleep
by
switching
my
car
and
giving
me
a
bump
we
came
first
to
hawaii
and
i
fell
in
love
with
the
harbor
of
honolulu
as
we
sailed
in
here
at
last
i
began
to
see
the
strange
sights
and
hear
the
strange
sounds
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
ever
since
i
left
my
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
here
was
something
that
was
different
from
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
before
we
did
not
stay
so
long
on
the
way
home
i
was
to
stay
over
and
give
a
performance
in
honolulu
but
not
now
our
time
was
given
up
to
sight
seeing
and
to
meeting
some
of
the
folk
of
the
islands
they
ken
hospitality
we
made
many
new
friends
there
short
as
the
time
was
and
man
the
lassies
you
want
to
cuddle
the
first
lassie
you
meet
when
you
step
ashore
at
honolulu
but
you
do
if
the
wife
is
there
it
was
only
because
i
knew
that
we
were
to
stop
longer
on
the
way
back
that
i
was
willing
to
leave
honolulu
at
all
so
we
sailed
on
toward
australia
and
now
i
knew
that
my
boy
was
about
setting
out
on
his
great
voyage
around
the
world
day
by
day
i
would
get
out
the
map
and
try
to
prick
the
spot
where
he
be
and
i
think
aye
when
i
here
john
be
there
will
he
be
nearer
to
me
than
now
thinking
of
the
braw
laddie
setting
out
so
proud
and
happy
made
me
think
of
my
ain
young
days
my
father
couldna
give
me
such
a
chance
as
my
boy
was
to
have
i
worked
in
the
mines
before
i
was
age
there
been
no
cambridge
for
me
no
trip
around
the
world
as
a
part
of
my
education
and
i
thanked
god
that
he
was
letting
me
do
so
much
for
my
boy
aye
and
he
deserved
it
did
john
he
done
well
at
cambridge
he
had
taken
honors
there
and
soon
he
was
to
go
up
to
london
to
read
for
the
bar
he
was
to
be
a
barrister
in
wig
and
gown
my
son
john
it
was
of
him
and
of
the
meeting
we
were
all
to
have
in
australia
that
i
thought
more
than
anything
else
in
the
long
long
days
upon
the
sea
we
sailed
on
from
honolulu
until
we
came
to
so
it
is
spelled
but
all
the
natives
call
it
here
i
saw
more
and
yet
more
of
the
strange
and
wonderful
things
i
had
thought
upon
so
long
back
in
dunoon
here
i
saw
mankind
for
the
first
time
in
a
natural
state
i
saw
men
who
wore
only
the
figleaf
of
old
father
adam
and
a
people
who
lived
from
day
to
day
and
whom
the
kindly
earth
sustained
they
lived
entirely
from
vegetables
and
from
clear
crystal
streams
and
upon
marvelous
fish
from
the
sea
ah
how
i
longed
to
stay
in
and
be
a
natural
man
but
i
must
go
on
work
called
me
back
to
civilization
and
i
heeded
its
call
and
waved
to
the
natural
folk
of
it
was
before
i
came
to
that
i
wrote
a
little
verse
inspired
by
honolulu
perhaps
if
i
had
gone
first
to
do
forget
to
put
in
the
n
and
call
it
when
you
say
it
to
yourself
i
might
have
written
it
of
that
happy
island
of
the
natural
folk
but
i
did
not
so
here
is
the
verse
i
love
you
honolulu
honolulu
i
love
you
you
are
the
queen
of
the
sea
your
valleys
and
mountains
your
palais
and
fountains
forever
and
ever
will
be
dear
to
me
i
wedded
a
simple
melody
to
those
simple
lines
and
since
then
i
have
sung
the
song
in
pretty
nearly
every
part
of
the
world
and
in
honolulu
itself
our
journey
was
drawing
to
its
end
we
were
coming
to
a
strange
land
indeed
and
yet
i
knew
there
were
scots
folk
there
where
in
the
world
are
there
not
i
thought
they
would
be
glad
to
see
me
but
how
could
i
be
sure
it
was
a
far
far
cry
from
dunoon
and
the
clyde
and
the
frost
upon
the
heather
on
the
day
i
had
set
out
we
were
to
land
at
sydney
i
was
a
wee
bit
impatient
after
we
had
made
our
landfall
while
the
old
poked
her
way
along
but
she
would
not
be
hurried
by
my
impatience
and
at
last
we
came
to
the
sydney
heads
the
famous
harbor
heads
if
you
have
never
seen
it
i
do
not
know
how
better
to
tell
you
of
it
than
to
say
that
it
makes
me
think
of
the
entrance
to
a
great
cave
that
has
no
roof
in
we
went
and
were
within
that
great
nearly
landlocked
harbor
and
what
goings
on
there
were
the
harbor
was
full
of
craft
both
great
and
sma
and
each
had
all
her
bunting
flying
oh
they
were
braw
in
the
sunlight
with
the
gay
colors
and
the
bits
of
flags
all
fluttering
and
waving
in
the
breeze
and
what
a
din
there
was
with
the
shrieking
of
the
whistle
and
the
foghorns
and
the
sirens
and
the
clamor
of
bells
it
took
my
breath
away
and
i
wondered
what
was
afoot
and
on
the
shore
i
could
see
that
thousands
of
people
waited
all
crowded
together
by
the
water
side
there
were
flags
flying
too
from
all
the
buildings
it
must
be
that
the
king
is
coming
in
on
a
visit
and
i
never
to
have
heard
of
it
i
thought
and
then
they
made
me
understand
that
it
was
all
for
me
if
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
when
they
made
me
believe
that
will
you
blame
me
there
was
that
great
harbor
all
alive
with
the
welcome
they
made
for
me
and
on
the
shore
they
told
me
a
hundred
thousand
were
waiting
to
greet
me
and
bid
me
welcome
harry
the
tramways
had
stopped
running
until
they
had
done
with
their
welcome
to
and
all
over
the
city
as
we
drove
to
our
hotel
they
roared
their
welcome
and
there
were
flags
along
the
way
that
was
the
proudest
day
i
ha
d
ever
known
but
one
thing
made
me
wistful
and
wishful
i
wanted
my
boy
to
be
there
with
us
i
wished
he
had
seen
how
they
had
greeted
his
dad
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
an
honor
that
came
to
me
and
here
was
an
honor
indeed
a
reception
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
chapter
ii
it
was
on
the
day
of
march
in
that
year
of
that
dawned
in
peace
and
happiness
and
set
in
blood
and
death
and
bitter
sorrow
that
we
landed
in
sydney
soon
i
went
to
work
everywhere
my
audiences
showed
me
that
that
great
and
wonderful
reception
that
had
been
given
to
me
on
the
day
we
landed
had
been
only
an
earnest
of
what
was
to
come
they
greeted
me
everywhere
with
cheers
and
tears
and
everywhere
we
made
new
friends
and
sometimes
found
old
ones
of
whom
we
had
not
heard
for
years
and
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
now
of
my
boy
he
was
on
his
way
he
was
on
the
pacific
he
was
coming
to
me
across
the
ocean
and
i
could
smile
as
i
thought
of
how
this
thing
and
that
would
strike
him
and
of
the
smile
that
would
light
up
his
face
now
and
the
look
of
joy
that
would
come
into
his
eyes
at
the
sudden
sighting
of
some
beautiful
spot
oh
aye
those
were
happy
days
when
each
one
brought
my
boy
nearer
to
me
one
day
i
mind
the
newspapers
were
full
of
the
tale
of
a
crime
ill
an
odd
spot
in
europe
that
none
of
us
had
ever
heard
of
before
you
mind
the
place
serajevo
aye
we
all
mind
it
now
but
then
we
read
and
wondered
how
that
outlandish
name
might
be
pronounced
a
foreigner
was
murdered
what
if
he
was
a
prince
the
archduke
of
austria
need
we
lash
ourselves
about
him
and
so
we
read
and
were
sorry
a
little
for
the
puir
lady
who
sat
beside
the
archduke
and
was
killed
with
him
and
then
we
forgot
it
all
australia
did
there
was
no
more
in
the
newspapers
and
my
son
john
was
coming
coming
each
day
he
was
so
many
hundred
miles
nearer
to
me
and
at
last
he
came
we
were
in
melbourne
then
it
was
near
to
the
end
of
july
we
had
much
to
talk
about
son
and
his
mother
and
i
it
was
long
months
since
we
had
seen
him
and
we
had
seen
and
done
so
much
the
time
flew
by
maybe
we
did
not
read
the
papers
so
carefully
as
we
might
have
done
they
tell
me
they
have
told
me
since
then
that
in
europe
and
even
in
america
there
was
some
warning
after
austria
moved
on
serbia
but
i
believe
that
down
there
in
australia
they
did
not
dream
of
danger
that
they
were
far
from
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
news
the
papers
did
print
they
were
so
far
away
and
then
you
ken
it
came
upon
us
like
a
clap
of
thunder
one
night
it
began
there
was
war
in
europe
real
war
germany
had
attacked
france
and
russia
she
was
moving
troops
through
belgium
and
every
briton
knew
what
that
must
mean
would
britain
be
drawn
in
there
was
the
question
that
was
on
every
man
tongue
what
do
you
think
son
i
asked
john
i
think
we
go
in
he
said
and
if
we
do
you
know
dad
send
for
me
to
come
home
at
once
i
on
leave
from
the
summer
training
camp
now
to
make
this
trip
my
boy
two
years
before
had
joined
the
territorial
army
he
was
a
second
lieutenant
in
a
territorial
battalion
of
the
argyle
and
sutherland
highlanders
it
was
much
as
if
he
had
been
an
officer
in
a
national
guard
regiment
in
the
united
states
the
territorial
army
was
not
bound
to
serve
abroad
but
who
could
doubt
that
it
would
and
gladly
as
it
did
to
a
man
to
a
man
but
it
was
a
shock
to
me
when
john
said
that
i
had
not
thought
that
war
even
if
it
came
could
come
home
to
us
so
close
and
so
soon
yet
so
it
was
the
next
day
was
the
fourth
of
august
my
birthday
and
it
was
that
day
that
britain
declared
war
upon
germany
we
sat
at
lunch
in
the
hotel
at
melbourne
when
the
newsboys
began
to
cry
the
extras
and
we
were
still
at
lunch
when
the
hall
porter
came
in
from
outside
leftenant
lauder
he
called
over
and
over
john
beckoned
to
him
and
he
handed
my
laddie
a
cablegram
just
two
words
there
were
that
had
come
singing
along
the
wires
half
way
around
the
world
mobilize
return
john
eyes
were
bright
they
were
shining
he
was
looking
at
us
but
he
was
not
seeing
us
those
eyes
of
his
were
seeing
distant
things
my
heart
way
sore
within
me
but
i
was
proud
and
happy
that
it
was
such
a
son
i
had
to
give
my
country
what
do
you
think
dad
he
asked
me
when
i
had
read
the
order
i
think
i
was
gruff
because
i
dared
not
let
him
see
how
i
felt
his
mother
was
very
pale
this
is
no
time
for
thinking
son
i
said
it
is
the
time
for
action
you
know
your
duty
he
rose
from
the
table
quickly
i
off
he
said
where
i
asked
him
to
the
ticket
office
to
see
about
changing
my
berth
there
a
steamer
this
week
maybe
i
can
still
find
room
aboard
her
he
was
not
long
gone
he
and
his
chum
went
down
together
and
come
back
smiling
triumphantly
it
all
right
dad
he
told
me
i
go
to
adelaide
by
train
and
get
the
steamer
there
i
have
time
to
see
you
and
mother
off
your
steamer
goes
two
hours
before
my
train
we
were
going
to
new
zealand
and
my
boy
was
was
going
home
to
fight
for
his
country
they
would
call
me
too
old
i
knew
i
was
the
day
britain
declared
war
what
a
turmoil
there
was
about
us
so
fast
were
things
moving
that
there
seemed
no
time
for
thought
john
mother
and
i
could
not
realize
the
full
meaning
of
all
that
was
happening
but
we
knew
that
john
was
snatched
away
from
us
just
after
he
had
come
and
it
was
hard
it
was
cruelly
hard
but
such
thoughts
were
drowned
in
the
great
surging
excitement
that
was
all
about
us
in
melbourne
and
i
believe
it
must
have
been
much
the
same
elsewhere
in
australia
folks
did
know
what
they
were
to
do
how
they
were
to
take
this
war
that
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
them
and
rumors
and
questions
flew
in
all
directions
suppose
the
germans
came
to
australia
was
there
a
chance
of
that
they
had
islands
naval
bases
not
so
far
away
they
were
neighbors
what
of
the
german
navy
was
it
out
were
there
scattered
ships
here
and
there
that
might
swoop
down
upon
australia
shores
and
bring
death
and
destruction
with
them
but
even
before
we
sailed
next
day
i
could
see
that
order
was
coming
out
of
that
chaos
everywhere
recruiting
offices
were
opening
and
men
were
flocking
to
them
no
one
dreamed
really
of
a
long
war
though
john
laughed
sadly
when
someone
said
it
would
be
over
in
four
months
but
these
australians
took
no
chances
they
would
offer
themselves
first
and
let
it
be
decided
later
whether
they
were
needed
so
we
sailed
away
and
when
i
took
john
hand
and
kissed
him
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
in
his
civilian
clothes
well
son
i
said
you
going
home
to
be
a
soldier
a
fighting
soldier
you
will
soon
be
commanding
men
remember
that
you
can
never
ask
a
man
to
do
something
you
would
no
dare
to
do
yourself
and
oh
the
braw
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
bonnie
laddie
as
he
tilted
his
chin
up
to
me
i
will
remember
dad
he
said
and
so
long
as
a
bit
of
the
dock
was
in
sight
we
could
see
him
waving
to
us
we
were
not
to
see
him
again
until
the
next
january
at
bedford
in
england
where
he
was
training
the
raw
men
of
his
company
those
were
the
first
days
of
war
the
british
navy
was
on
guard
from
every
quarter
the
whimpering
wireless
brought
news
of
this
german
warship
and
that
they
were
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
seven
seas
you
ken
when
the
war
broke
out
there
was
no
time
for
them
to
make
a
home
port
they
had
their
choice
most
of
them
between
being
interned
in
some
neutral
port
and
setting
out
to
do
as
much
mischief
as
they
could
to
british
commerce
before
they
were
caught
caught
they
were
sure
to
be
they
must
have
known
it
and
some
there
were
to
brave
the
issue
and
match
themselves
against
england
great
naval
power
perhaps
they
knew
that
few
ports
would
long
be
neutral
maybe
they
knew
of
the
abominable
war
the
hun
was
to
wage
but
i
think
it
was
not
such
men
as
those
who
chose
to
take
their
one
chance
in
a
thousand
who
were
sent
out
later
in
their
submarines
to
send
women
and
babies
a
to
their
deaths
with
their
torpedoes
be
that
as
it
may
we
sailed
away
from
melbourne
but
it
was
in
sydney
harbor
that
we
anchored
next
not
in
wellington
as
we
on
the
ship
all
thought
it
would
be
and
the
reason
was
that
the
navy
getting
word
that
the
german
cruiser
was
loose
and
raiding
had
ordered
our
captain
to
hug
the
shore
and
to
put
in
at
sydney
until
he
was
told
it
was
safe
to
proceed
we
were
not
much
delayed
and
came
to
wellington
safely
new
zealand
was
all
ablaze
with
the
war
spirit
there
was
no
hesitation
there
the
new
zealand
troops
were
mobilizing
when
we
arrived
and
every
recruiting
office
was
besieged
with
men
splendid
laddies
they
were
who
looked
as
if
they
would
give
a
great
account
of
themselves
as
they
did
as
they
did
their
deeds
at
gallipoli
speak
for
them
and
will
forever
speak
for
them
the
men
of
australia
and
new
zealand
there
the
word
anzac
was
made
made
from
the
first
letters
of
these
words
australian
new
zealand
army
corps
it
is
a
word
that
will
never
die
even
in
the
midst
of
war
they
had
time
to
give
me
a
welcome
that
warmed
my
heart
and
there
were
pipers
with
them
too
skirling
a
tune
as
i
stepped
ashore
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
again
as
there
had
been
at
sydney
every
laddie
in
uniform
made
me
think
of
my
own
boy
well
off
by
now
on
his
way
home
to
britain
and
the
duty
that
had
called
him
they
were
gathering
all
over
the
empire
those
of
british
blood
they
were
answering
the
call
old
britain
had
sent
across
the
seven
seas
to
the
far
corners
of
the
earth
even
as
the
scottish
clans
gathered
of
old
the
greater
british
clans
were
gathering
now
it
was
a
great
thing
to
see
that
in
the
beginning
it
has
comforted
me
many
a
time
since
in
a
black
hour
when
news
was
bad
and
the
hun
was
thundering
at
the
line
that
was
so
thinly
held
in
france
here
were
free
peoples
not
held
not
bound
free
to
choose
their
way
britain
could
not
make
their
sons
come
to
her
aid
if
they
came
they
must
come
freely
joyously
knowing
that
it
was
a
right
cause
a
holy
cause
a
good
cause
that
called
them
i
think
of
the
way
they
came
of
the
way
i
saw
them
rising
to
the
summons
in
new
zealand
in
australia
later
in
canada
aye
and
i
saw
more
i
saw
americans
slipping
across
the
border
putting
on
britain
khaki
there
in
canada
because
they
knew
that
it
was
the
fight
of
humanity
of
freedom
that
they
were
entering
and
that
too
gave
me
comfort
later
in
dark
times
for
it
made
me
know
that
when
the
right
time
came
america
would
take
her
place
beside
old
britain
and
brave
france
new
zealand
is
a
bonnie
land
it
made
me
think
sometimes
of
the
hielands
of
scotland
a
bonnie
land
and
braw
are
its
people
they
made
me
happy
there
and
they
made
much
of
me
at
christchurch
they
did
a
strange
thing
they
were
selling
off
at
auction
a
union
jack
the
flag
of
britain
such
a
thing
had
never
been
done
before
or
thought
of
but
here
was
a
reason
and
a
good
one
money
was
needed
for
the
laddies
who
were
going
needed
for
all
sorts
of
things
to
buy
them
small
comforts
and
tobacco
and
such
things
as
the
government
might
not
be
supplying
them
and
so
they
asked
me
to
be
their
auctioneer
i
played
a
fine
trick
upon
them
there
in
christchurch
but
i
was
not
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
think
they
have
me
those
good
bodies
at
christchurch
here
was
the
way
of
it
i
was
auctioneer
you
ken
but
that
was
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
bidding
myself
and
so
i
worked
them
up
and
on
and
then
i
bid
in
the
flag
for
myself
for
a
hundred
pounds
five
hundred
dollars
of
american
money
i
had
my
doots
about
how
they
be
taking
it
to
have
a
stranger
carry
their
flag
away
and
so
i
bided
a
wee
i
stayed
that
night
in
christchurch
and
was
to
stay
longer
i
could
wait
above
yon
town
of
christchurch
stretch
the
merino
hills
on
them
graze
sheep
by
the
thousand
and
it
is
from
those
sheep
that
the
true
merino
wool
comes
and
in
the
gutters
of
christchurch
there
flows
all
day
long
a
stream
of
water
as
clear
and
pure
as
ever
you
might
hope
to
see
and
it
should
be
so
for
it
is
from
artesian
wells
that
it
is
pumped
aweel
i
bided
that
night
and
by
next
day
they
were
murmuring
in
the
town
and
their
murmurs
came
to
me
they
thought
it
wasna
richt
for
a
scotsman
to
be
carrying
off
their
flag
though
he
bought
it
and
paid
for
it
and
so
at
last
they
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
be
buying
back
the
flag
and
i
was
agreeable
sell
it
back
to
ye
i
told
them
but
at
a
price
ye
ken
at
a
price
pay
me
twice
what
i
paid
for
it
and
it
shall
be
yours
there
was
a
scots
bargain
for
you
they
must
have
thought
me
mean
and
grasping
that
day
but
out
they
went
they
worked
for
the
money
it
was
but
just
a
month
after
war
had
been
declared
and
money
was
still
scarce
and
shy
of
peeping
out
and
showing
itself
but
bit
by
bit
they
got
the
siller
a
shilling
at
a
time
they
raised
by
subscription
but
they
got
it
all
and
brought
it
to
me
smiling
the
while
here
harry
here
your
money
they
said
now
give
us
back
our
flag
back
to
them
i
gave
it
and
with
it
the
money
they
had
brought
to
be
added
to
the
fund
for
the
soldier
boys
and
so
that
one
flag
brought
three
hundred
pounds
sterling
to
the
soldiers
i
wonder
did
those
folk
at
christchurch
think
i
would
keep
the
money
and
make
a
profit
on
that
flag
had
it
been
another
time
i
have
stayed
in
new
zealand
gladly
a
long
time
it
was
a
friendly
place
and
it
gave
us
many
a
new
friend
but
home
was
calling
me
there
was
more
than
the
homebound
tour
that
had
been
planned
and
laid
out
for
me
i
did
not
know
how
soon
my
boy
might
be
going
to
france
and
his
mother
and
i
wanted
to
see
him
again
before
he
went
and
to
be
as
near
him
as
might
be
so
i
was
glad
as
well
as
sorry
to
sail
away
from
new
friendly
shores
to
the
strains
of
pipers
softly
skirling
will
ye
no
come
back
again
we
sailed
for
sydney
on
the
a
fast
boat
we
were
glad
of
her
speed
a
day
or
so
out
for
there
was
smoke
on
the
horizon
that
gave
some
anxious
hours
to
our
officers
some
thought
the
german
raider
was
under
that
smoke
and
it
would
not
have
been
surprising
had
a
raider
turned
up
in
our
path
for
just
before
we
sailed
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
man
in
charge
of
the
principal
wireless
station
in
new
zealand
was
a
german
and
he
had
been
interned
had
he
sent
word
to
german
warships
of
the
plans
and
movements
of
british
ships
no
one
could
prove
it
so
he
was
only
interned
back
we
went
to
sydney
a
great
change
had
come
since
our
departure
the
war
ruled
all
deed
and
thought
australia
was
bound
now
to
do
her
part
no
less
faithfully
and
splendidly
than
new
zealand
was
she
engaged
upon
the
enterprise
the
hun
had
thrust
upon
the
world
everyone
was
eager
for
news
but
it
was
woefully
scarce
those
were
the
black
early
days
when
the
german
rush
upon
paris
was
being
stayed
after
the
disasters
of
the
first
fortnight
of
the
war
at
the
marne
everywhere
though
there
was
no
lack
of
determination
to
see
the
war
through
to
a
finish
no
matter
how
remote
that
might
be
the
feeling
was
that
this
war
was
too
huge
too
vast
to
last
long
exhaustion
would
end
it
war
upon
the
modern
scale
could
not
last
so
they
said
in
september
so
many
of
us
believed
and
this
is
the
spring
of
the
fourth
year
of
the
war
and
the
end
is
not
yet
is
not
in
sight
i
fear
sydney
turned
out
almost
as
magnificently
as
when
i
had
first
landed
upon
australian
soil
to
bid
me
farewell
and
we
embarked
again
upon
that
same
old
that
had
brought
us
to
australia
again
i
saw
and
the
natural
folk
who
had
no
need
to
toil
nor
spin
to
live
upon
the
fat
of
the
land
and
be
arrayed
in
the
garments
that
were
always
up
to
the
minute
in
style
again
i
saw
honolulu
and
this
time
stayed
longer
and
gave
a
performance
but
though
we
were
there
longer
it
was
not
long
enough
to
make
me
yield
to
that
temptation
to
cuddle
one
of
the
brown
lassies
aweel
i
was
not
so
young
as
i
had
been
and
lauder
you
ken
that
she
was
travelling
with
me
in
the
harbor
of
honolulu
there
was
a
german
gunboat
the
that
had
run
there
for
shelter
not
long
since
and
had
still
left
a
day
or
two
under
the
orders
from
washington
to
decide
whether
she
would
let
herself
be
interned
or
not
and
outside
beyond
the
three
mile
limit
that
marked
the
end
of
american
territorial
waters
were
two
good
reasons
to
make
the
german
think
well
of
being
interned
they
were
two
cruisers
squat
and
ugly
and
vicious
in
their
gray
war
paint
that
watched
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
as
you
have
seen
a
cat
watching
a
rat
hole
it
was
not
britain
white
ensign
that
they
flew
those
cruisers
it
was
the
red
sun
flag
of
japan
one
of
britain
allies
against
the
hun
they
had
their
vigil
in
vain
did
those
two
cruisers
it
was
valor
better
part
discretion
that
the
german
captain
chose
aweel
you
could
no
blame
him
he
and
his
ship
would
have
been
blown
out
of
the
water
so
soon
as
she
poked
her
nose
beyond
american
waters
had
he
chosen
to
go
out
and
fight
i
was
glad
indeed
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
golden
gate
once
more
and
when
we
were
safe
ashore
in
san
francisco
it
had
been
a
voyage
in
many
ways
my
wife
and
i
were
torn
with
anxiety
about
our
boy
and
there
were
german
raiders
loose
one
or
two
had
so
far
eluded
the
cordon
the
british
fleet
had
flung
about
the
world
one
night
soon
after
we
left
honolulu
we
were
stopped
we
thought
it
was
a
british
cruiser
that
stopped
us
but
she
would
only
ask
questions
answering
those
we
asked
was
not
for
her
but
we
were
ashore
at
last
there
remained
only
the
trip
across
the
united
states
to
new
york
and
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
home
chapter
iii
now
indeed
we
began
to
get
real
news
of
the
war
we
heard
of
how
that
little
british
army
had
flung
itself
into
the
maw
of
the
hun
i
came
to
know
something
of
the
glories
of
the
retreat
from
mons
and
of
how
french
and
british
had
turned
together
at
the
marne
and
had
saved
paris
but
alas
i
heard
too
of
how
many
brave
men
had
died
had
been
sacrificed
many
and
many
a
man
of
them
to
the
failure
of
britain
to
prepare
that
was
past
and
done
what
had
been
wrong
was
being
mended
now
better
indeed
ah
a
thousand
times
better
had
britain
given
heed
to
lord
roberts
when
he
preached
the
gospel
of
readiness
and
prayed
his
countrymen
to
prepare
for
the
war
that
he
in
his
wisdom
had
foreseen
but
it
was
easier
now
to
look
into
the
future
i
could
see
as
all
the
world
was
beginning
to
see
that
this
war
was
not
like
other
wars
lord
kitchener
had
said
that
britain
must
make
ready
for
a
three
year
war
and
i
for
one
believed
him
when
others
scoffed
and
said
he
was
talking
so
to
make
the
recruits
for
his
armies
come
faster
to
the
colors
i
could
see
that
this
war
might
last
for
years
and
it
was
then
back
in
in
the
first
winter
of
the
war
that
i
began
to
warn
my
friends
in
america
that
they
might
well
expect
the
hun
to
drag
them
into
the
war
before
its
end
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
must
beg
americans
who
would
listen
to
me
to
prepare
so
all
the
way
across
the
continent
i
spoke
in
every
town
we
visited
on
that
subject
of
preparedness
i
had
seen
britain
living
in
just
such
a
blissful
anticipation
of
eternal
peace
as
america
then
dreamed
of
i
had
heard
for
years
every
attempt
that
was
made
to
induce
britain
to
increase
her
army
met
with
the
one
unvarying
reply
we
have
our
fleet
that
was
the
answer
that
was
made
and
be
it
remembered
that
at
sea
britain
prepared
we
have
our
fleet
we
need
no
army
if
there
is
a
continental
war
we
may
not
be
drawn
in
at
all
even
if
we
are
they
ca
reach
us
the
fleet
is
between
us
and
invasion
but
said
the
advocates
of
preparedness
we
might
have
to
send
an
expeditionary
force
if
france
were
attacked
we
should
have
to
help
her
on
land
as
well
as
at
sea
and
we
have
sent
armies
to
the
continent
before
yes
the
other
would
reply
we
have
an
expeditionary
force
we
can
send
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
men
across
the
channel
at
short
notice
the
shortest
and
we
can
train
more
men
here
at
home
in
case
of
need
the
fleet
makes
that
possible
aye
the
fleet
made
that
possible
the
world
may
well
thank
god
for
the
british
fleet
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
like
to
think
what
might
have
come
about
save
for
the
british
fleet
but
i
do
know
what
came
to
that
expeditionary
force
that
we
sent
across
the
channel
quickly
to
the
help
of
our
sore
stricken
ally
france
how
many
of
that
old
british
army
still
survive
they
gave
themselves
utterly
they
were
the
pick
and
the
flower
of
our
trained
manhood
they
should
have
trained
the
millions
who
were
to
rise
at
kitchener
call
but
they
could
not
be
held
back
they
are
gone
others
have
risen
up
to
take
their
places
ten
for
one
a
hundred
for
one
but
had
they
been
ready
at
the
start
the
bonnie
laddies
who
would
be
living
now
instead
of
lying
in
an
unmarked
grave
in
france
or
flanders
the
women
whose
eyes
would
never
have
been
reddened
by
their
weeping
as
they
mourned
a
son
or
a
brother
or
a
husband
so
i
was
thinking
as
i
set
out
to
talk
to
my
american
friends
and
beg
them
to
prepare
prepare
i
did
not
want
to
see
this
country
share
the
experience
of
britain
if
she
needs
must
be
drawn
into
the
war
and
so
i
believed
profoundly
from
the
time
when
i
first
learned
the
true
measure
of
the
hun
i
hoped
that
she
might
be
ready
when
she
drew
her
mighty
sword
they
thought
i
was
mad
at
first
many
of
those
to
whom
i
talked
they
were
so
far
away
from
the
war
and
already
the
propaganda
of
the
germans
was
at
work
aye
they
thought
i
was
raving
when
i
told
them
i
stake
my
word
on
it
america
would
never
be
able
to
stay
out
until
the
end
they
listened
to
me
they
were
willing
to
do
that
but
they
listened
doubtingly
i
think
i
convinced
few
of
ought
save
that
i
believed
myself
what
i
was
saying
i
could
tell
them
do
you
ken
that
i
thought
at
first
as
they
did
why
over
yon
in
australia
when
i
first
heard
that
the
germans
were
attacking
france
i
was
sorry
for
france
is
a
bonnie
land
but
the
idea
that
britain
might
go
in
i
even
then
had
laughed
at
and
then
britain
gone
in
my
own
boy
had
gone
to
the
war
for
all
i
knew
i
might
be
reading
of
him
any
day
when
i
read
of
a
charge
or
a
fight
over
there
in
france
anything
was
possible
aye
probable
i
have
never
called
myself
a
prophet
but
then
i
think
i
had
something
of
a
prophet
vision
and
all
the
time
i
was
struggling
with
my
growing
belief
that
this
was
to
be
a
long
war
and
a
merciless
war
i
did
not
want
to
believe
some
of
the
things
i
knew
i
must
believe
but
every
day
came
news
that
made
conviction
sink
in
deeper
and
yet
deeper
it
was
not
a
happy
trip
that
one
across
the
united
states
our
friends
did
all
they
could
to
make
it
so
but
we
were
consumed
by
too
many
anxieties
and
cares
how
different
was
it
from
my
journey
westward
only
nine
months
earlier
the
world
had
changed
forever
in
those
nine
months
everywhere
i
spoke
for
preparedness
i
addressed
the
rotary
clubs
and
great
audiences
turned
out
to
listen
to
me
i
am
a
rotarian
myself
and
i
am
proud
indeed
that
i
may
so
proclaim
myself
it
is
a
great
organization
those
who
came
to
hear
me
were
cordial
nearly
always
but
once
or
twice
i
met
hostility
veiled
but
not
to
be
mistaken
and
it
was
easy
to
trace
it
to
its
source
germans
who
loved
the
country
they
had
left
behind
them
to
come
to
a
new
world
that
offered
them
a
better
home
and
a
richer
life
than
they
could
ever
have
aspired
to
at
home
were
often
at
the
bottom
of
the
opposition
to
what
i
had
to
say
they
did
not
want
america
to
prepare
lest
her
weight
be
flung
into
the
scale
against
germany
and
there
were
those
who
hated
britain
some
of
these
remembered
old
wars
and
grudges
that
sensible
folk
had
forgotten
long
since
others
it
may
be
had
other
motives
but
there
was
little
real
opposition
to
what
i
had
to
say
it
was
more
a
good
natured
scoffing
and
a
feeling
that
i
was
cracked
a
wee
bit
perhaps
about
the
war
i
was
not
sorry
to
see
new
york
again
we
stayed
there
but
one
day
and
then
sailed
for
home
on
the
cunarder
which
has
since
been
sunk
like
many
another
good
ship
by
the
hun
submarines
but
those
were
the
days
just
before
the
hun
began
his
career
of
real
frightfulness
upon
the
sea
and
under
it
even
the
hun
came
gradually
to
the
height
of
his
powers
in
this
war
it
was
not
until
some
weeks
later
that
he
startled
the
world
by
proclaiming
that
every
ship
that
dared
to
cross
a
certain
zone
of
the
sea
would
be
sunk
without
warning
when
we
sailed
upon
the
old
we
had
anxieties
to
be
sure
the
danger
of
striking
a
mine
was
never
absent
once
we
neared
the
british
coasts
there
was
always
the
chance
we
knew
that
some
german
raider
might
have
slipped
through
the
cordon
in
the
north
sea
but
the
terrors
that
were
to
follow
the
crime
of
the
still
lay
in
the
future
they
were
among
the
things
no
man
could
foresee
the
brought
us
safe
to
the
mersey
and
we
landed
at
liverpool
even
had
there
been
no
thought
of
danger
to
the
ship
that
voyage
would
have
been
a
hard
one
for
us
to
endure
we
never
ceased
thinking
of
john
longing
for
him
and
news
of
him
it
was
near
christmas
but
we
had
small
hope
that
we
should
be
able
to
see
him
on
that
day
all
through
the
voyage
we
were
shut
away
from
all
news
the
wireless
is
silenced
in
time
of
war
save
for
such
work
as
the
government
allows
there
is
none
of
the
free
sending
from
shore
to
ship
and
ship
to
ship
of
all
the
news
of
the
world
such
as
one
grows
to
welcome
in
time
of
peace
and
so
from
new
york
until
we
neared
the
british
coast
we
brooded
all
of
us
how
fared
it
with
britain
in
the
war
had
the
hun
launched
some
new
and
terrible
attack
illustration
i
did
not
stop
at
sending
out
my
recruiting
band
i
went
out
see
but
two
days
out
from
home
we
saw
a
sight
to
make
us
glad
and
end
our
brooding
for
a
space
eh
harry
come
and
look
you
someone
called
to
me
it
was
early
in
the
morning
and
there
was
a
mist
about
us
i
went
to
the
rail
and
looked
in
the
direction
i
was
told
and
there
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
mist
shattering
it
i
saw
great
gray
ships
warships
british
battleships
and
cruisers
there
they
were
some
of
the
great
ships
that
are
the
steel
wall
around
britain
that
holds
her
safe
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
and
pride
at
the
sight
of
them
those
great
gray
guardians
of
the
british
shores
bulwarks
of
steel
that
fend
all
foemen
from
the
rugged
coast
and
the
fair
land
that
lies
behind
it
now
we
were
safe
ourselves
who
would
not
trust
the
british
navy
after
the
great
deeds
it
has
done
in
this
war
for
there
mind
you
is
the
one
force
that
has
never
failed
the
british
navy
has
done
what
it
set
out
to
do
it
has
kept
command
of
the
seas
the
submarines
the
tin
fish
they
do
not
command
the
sea
have
they
kept
canada
men
and
america
from
reaching
france
when
we
landed
my
first
inquiry
was
for
my
son
john
he
was
well
and
he
was
still
in
england
in
training
at
bedford
with
his
regiment
the
argyle
and
sutherland
highlanders
but
it
was
as
we
had
feared
our
christmas
must
be
kept
apart
and
so
the
day
before
christmas
found
us
back
in
our
wee
hoose
on
the
clyde
at
dunoon
but
we
thought
of
little
else
but
the
laddie
who
was
making
ready
to
fight
for
us
and
of
the
day
that
was
coming
soon
when
we
should
see
him
chapter
iv
it
was
a
fitting
place
to
train
men
for
war
bedford
where
john
was
with
his
regiment
and
where
his
mother
and
i
went
to
see
him
so
soon
as
we
could
after
christmas
it
is
in
the
british
midlands
but
before
the
factory
towns
begin
it
is
a
pleasant
smiling
country
farming
country
mostly
with
good
roads
and
fields
that
gave
the
boys
chances
to
learn
the
work
of
digging
trenches
aye
and
living
in
them
afterward
bedford
is
one
of
the
great
school
towns
of
england
low
rolling
hills
lie
about
it
the
river
ouse
a
wee
quiet
stream
runs
through
it
schooling
must
be
in
the
air
of
bedford
three
great
schools
for
boys
are
there
and
two
for
girls
and
liberty
is
in
the
air
of
bedford
too
i
think
john
bunyan
was
born
two
miles
from
bedford
and
his
old
house
still
stands
in
elstow
a
little
village
of
old
houses
and
great
oaks
and
it
was
in
bedford
jail
that
bunyan
was
imprisoned
because
he
would
fight
for
the
freedom
of
his
own
soul
john
was
waiting
to
greet
us
and
he
looked
great
he
had
two
stars
now
where
he
had
one
before
he
had
been
promoted
to
first
lieutenant
there
were
curious
changes
in
the
laddie
i
remembered
he
was
bigger
i
thought
and
he
looked
older
and
graver
but
that
i
could
not
wonder
at
he
had
a
great
responsibility
the
lives
of
other
men
had
been
entrusted
to
him
and
john
was
not
the
man
to
take
a
responsibility
like
that
lightly
i
saw
him
the
first
day
i
was
at
bedford
leading
some
of
his
men
in
a
practice
charge
big
braw
laddies
they
were
all
in
their
kilts
he
ran
ahead
of
them
smiling
as
he
saw
me
watching
them
but
turning
back
to
cheer
them
on
if
he
thought
they
were
not
fast
enough
i
could
see
as
i
watched
him
that
he
had
caught
the
habit
of
command
he
was
going
to
be
a
good
officer
it
was
a
proud
thought
for
me
and
again
i
was
rejoiced
that
it
was
such
a
son
that
i
was
able
to
offer
to
my
country
they
were
kept
busy
at
that
training
camp
men
were
needed
sore
in
france
recruits
were
going
over
every
day
what
the
retreat
from
mons
and
the
battle
of
the
marne
had
left
of
that
first
heroic
expeditionary
force
the
first
battle
of
ypres
had
come
close
to
wiping
out
in
the
ypres
salient
our
men
out
there
were
hanging
on
like
grim
death
there
was
no
time
to
spare
at
bedford
where
men
were
being
made
ready
as
quickly
as
might
be
to
take
their
turn
in
the
trenches
but
there
was
a
little
time
when
john
and
i
could
talk
what
do
you
need
most
son
i
asked
him
men
he
cried
men
dad
men
they
coming
in
quickly
oh
britain
has
answered
nobly
to
the
call
but
they
not
coming
in
fast
enough
we
must
have
more
men
more
men
i
had
thought
when
i
asked
my
question
of
something
john
might
be
needing
for
himself
or
for
his
men
mayhap
but
when
he
answered
me
so
i
said
nothing
i
only
began
to
think
i
wanted
to
go
myself
but
i
knew
they
would
not
have
me
yet
awhile
at
any
rate
and
still
i
felt
that
i
must
do
something
i
could
not
rest
idle
while
all
around
me
men
were
giving
themselves
and
all
they
had
and
were
everywhere
i
heard
the
same
cry
that
john
had
raised
men
give
us
men
it
came
from
lord
kitchener
it
came
from
the
men
in
command
in
france
and
belgium
that
little
strip
of
belgium
the
hun
had
not
been
able
to
conquer
it
came
from
every
broken
maimed
man
who
came
back
home
to
britain
to
be
patched
up
that
he
might
go
out
again
there
were
scores
of
thousands
of
men
in
britain
who
needed
only
the
last
quick
shove
to
send
them
across
the
line
of
enlistment
and
after
i
had
thought
a
while
i
hit
upon
a
plan
what
stirs
a
man
fighting
spirit
quicker
or
better
than
the
right
sort
of
music
i
asked
myself
and
what
sort
of
music
does
it
best
of
all
there
can
be
only
one
answer
to
that
last
question
and
so
i
organized
my
recruiting
band
that
was
to
be
famous
all
over
britain
before
so
very
long
i
gathered
fourteen
of
the
best
pipers
and
drummers
i
could
find
in
all
scotland
i
equipped
them
gave
them
the
highland
uniform
and
sent
them
out
to
travel
over
britain
skirling
and
drumming
the
wail
of
war
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
they
were
to
go
everywhere
carrying
the
shrieking
of
the
pipes
into
the
highways
and
the
byways
and
so
they
did
and
i
paid
the
bills
that
was
the
first
of
many
recruiting
bands
that
toured
britain
because
it
was
the
first
and
because
of
the
way
the
pipers
skirled
out
the
old
hill
melodies
and
songs
of
scotland
enormous
crowds
followed
my
band
and
it
led
them
straight
to
the
recruiting
stations
there
was
a
swing
and
a
sway
about
those
old
tunes
that
the
young
fellows
could
resist
the
pipers
would
begin
to
skirl
and
the
drums
to
beat
in
a
square
maybe
or
near
the
railway
station
and
every
time
the
skirling
of
the
pipes
would
bring
the
crowd
then
the
pipers
would
march
when
the
crowd
was
big
enough
and
lead
the
way
always
to
the
recruiting
place
and
once
they
were
there
the
young
fellows
who
were
quite
ready
to
decide
and
the
others
who
were
just
plain
slackers
willing
to
let
better
men
die
for
them
found
it
mighty
hard
to
keep
from
going
on
the
wee
rest
of
the
way
that
the
pipers
had
left
them
to
make
alone
it
was
wonderful
work
my
band
did
and
when
the
returns
came
to
me
i
felt
like
the
pied
piper
yes
i
did
indeed
i
did
not
travel
with
my
band
that
would
have
been
a
waste
of
effort
there
was
work
for
both
of
us
to
do
separately
i
was
booked
for
a
tour
of
britain
and
everywhere
i
went
i
spoke
and
urged
the
young
men
to
enlist
i
made
as
many
speeches
as
i
could
in
every
town
and
city
that
i
visited
and
i
made
special
trips
to
many
i
thought
and
there
were
those
who
agreed
with
me
that
i
could
it
might
be
reach
audiences
another
speaker
better
trained
than
i
no
doubt
in
this
sort
of
work
would
not
touch
so
there
was
i
without
official
standing
going
about
urging
every
man
who
could
to
don
khaki
i
talked
wherever
and
whenever
i
could
get
an
audience
together
and
i
began
then
the
habit
of
making
speeches
in
the
theatres
after
my
performance
that
i
have
not
yet
given
up
i
talked
thus
to
the
young
men
if
you
do
do
your
duty
now
i
told
them
you
may
live
to
be
old
men
but
even
if
you
do
you
will
regret
it
yours
will
be
a
sorrowful
old
age
in
the
years
to
come
mayhap
there
be
a
wee
grandchild
nestling
on
your
knee
that
circle
its
little
arms
about
your
neck
and
look
into
your
wrinkled
face
and
ask
you
old
are
you
grandpa
you
a
very
old
man
how
will
you
answer
that
bairn
question
so
i
asked
the
young
men
and
then
i
answered
for
them
i
do
know
how
old
i
am
but
i
am
so
old
that
i
can
remember
the
great
war
and
then
i
told
them
the
young
men
who
were
wavering
and
then
will
come
the
question
that
you
will
always
have
to
dread
when
you
have
won
through
to
the
old
age
that
may
be
yours
in
safety
if
you
shirk
now
for
the
bairn
will
ask
you
straightaway
fight
in
the
great
war
grandpa
what
did
you
do
god
help
the
man
i
told
them
who
can
not
hand
it
down
as
a
heritage
to
his
children
and
his
children
children
that
he
fought
in
the
great
war
i
must
have
impressed
many
a
brave
lad
who
wanted
only
a
bit
of
resolution
to
make
him
do
his
duty
they
tell
me
that
i
and
my
band
together
influenced
more
than
twelve
thousand
men
to
join
the
colors
they
give
me
credit
for
that
many
in
one
way
and
another
i
am
proud
of
that
but
i
am
prouder
still
of
the
way
the
boys
who
enlisted
upon
my
urging
feel
never
a
one
has
upbraided
me
never
a
one
has
told
me
he
was
sorry
he
had
heard
me
and
been
led
to
go
it
is
far
otherwise
the
laddies
who
went
because
of
me
called
me
their
godfather
many
of
them
many
the
letter
i
have
had
from
them
many
the
one
who
has
greeted
me
as
i
was
passing
through
a
hospital
or
long
afterward
when
i
made
my
first
tour
in
france
behind
the
front
line
trenches
many
letters
did
i
say
i
have
had
hundreds
thousands
and
not
so
much
as
a
word
of
regret
in
any
one
of
them
it
was
not
only
in
britain
that
i
influenced
enlistments
i
preached
the
cause
of
the
empire
in
canada
later
and
here
is
a
bit
of
verse
that
a
canadian
sergeant
sent
to
me
he
dedicated
it
to
me
indeed
and
i
am
proud
and
glad
that
he
did
one
of
the
boys
who
went
say
here
now
mate
do
you
figure
it
great
to
think
when
this
war
is
all
over
when
we
through
with
this
mud
and
spilling
o
blood
and
we
shipped
back
again
to
old
dover
when
they
paid
us
our
tin
and
we
blown
the
lot
in
and
our
last
penny
is
spent
we
still
have
a
thought
if
it
all
that
we
got
i
one
of
the
boys
who
went
and
perhaps
later
on
when
your
wild
days
are
gone
you
be
settling
down
for
life
you
a
girl
in
your
eye
you
ask
bye
and
bye
to
share
up
with
you
as
your
wife
when
a
few
years
have
flown
and
you
kids
of
your
own
and
you
feeling
quite
snug
and
content
it
make
your
heart
glad
when
they
boast
of
their
dad
as
one
of
the
boys
who
went
there
was
much
work
for
me
to
do
beside
my
share
in
the
campaign
to
increase
enlistments
every
day
now
the
wards
of
the
hospitals
were
filling
up
men
suffering
from
frightful
wounds
came
back
to
be
mended
and
made
as
near
whole
as
might
be
and
among
them
there
was
work
for
me
if
ever
the
world
held
work
for
any
man
i
did
not
wait
to
begin
my
work
in
the
hospitals
everywhere
i
went
where
there
were
wounded
men
i
sang
for
those
who
were
strong
enough
to
be
allowed
to
listen
and
told
them
stories
and
did
all
i
could
to
cheer
them
up
it
was
heartrending
work
oftentimes
there
were
dour
sights
dreadful
sights
in
those
hospitals
there
were
wounds
the
memory
of
which
robbed
me
of
sleep
there
were
men
doomed
to
blindness
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
but
over
all
there
was
a
spirit
that
never
lagged
or
faltered
and
that
strengthened
me
when
i
thought
some
sight
was
more
than
i
could
bear
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
british
soldier
triumphant
over
suffering
and
cruel
disfigurement
with
his
inevitable
answer
to
any
question
as
to
how
he
was
getting
on
i
never
heard
that
answer
varied
when
a
man
could
speak
at
all
always
it
was
the
same
two
words
were
enough
all
right
chapter
v
as
i
went
about
the
country
now
working
hard
to
recruit
men
to
induce
people
to
subscribe
to
the
war
loan
doing
all
the
things
in
which
i
saw
a
chance
to
make
myself
useful
there
was
now
an
ever
present
thought
when
would
john
go
out
he
must
go
soon
i
knew
that
so
did
his
mother
we
had
learned
that
he
would
not
be
sent
without
a
chance
to
bid
us
there
we
were
better
off
than
many
a
father
and
mother
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
many
the
mother
who
learned
first
that
her
lad
had
gone
to
france
when
they
told
her
he
was
dead
and
many
the
lassie
who
learned
in
the
same
way
that
her
lover
would
never
come
home
to
be
her
husband
but
by
now
britain
was
settled
down
to
war
it
was
as
if
war
were
the
natural
state
of
things
and
everything
was
adjusted
to
war
and
those
who
must
fight
it
and
many
things
were
ordered
better
and
more
mercifully
than
they
had
been
at
first
it
was
in
april
that
word
came
to
us
we
might
see
john
again
his
mother
and
i
if
we
hurried
to
bedford
and
so
we
did
for
once
i
heeded
no
other
call
it
was
a
sad
journey
but
i
was
proud
and
glad
as
well
as
sorry
john
must
do
his
share
there
was
no
reason
why
my
son
should
take
fewer
risks
than
another
man
that
was
something
all
britain
was
learning
in
those
days
we
were
one
people
we
must
fight
as
one
one
for
all
all
for
one
john
was
sober
when
he
met
us
sober
aye
but
what
a
light
there
was
in
his
eyes
he
was
eager
to
be
at
the
huns
tales
of
their
doings
were
coming
back
to
us
now
faster
and
faster
they
were
tales
to
shock
me
but
they
were
tales
too
to
whet
the
courage
and
sharpen
the
steel
of
every
man
who
could
fight
and
meant
to
go
it
was
john
turn
to
go
so
it
was
he
felt
and
so
it
was
his
mother
and
i
bid
him
farewell
there
at
bedford
we
did
not
know
whether
we
would
ever
see
him
again
the
bonnie
laddie
we
had
to
bid
him
lest
it
be
our
last
chance
for
in
britain
we
knew
by
then
what
were
the
chances
they
took
those
boys
of
ours
who
went
out
son
good
luck
dad
see
you
when
i
get
leave
that
was
all
we
were
not
allowed
to
know
more
than
that
he
was
ordered
to
france
whereabouts
in
the
long
trench
line
he
would
be
sent
we
were
not
told
somewhere
in
france
that
phrase
that
had
been
dinned
so
often
into
our
ears
had
a
meaning
for
us
now
and
now
indeed
our
days
and
nights
were
anxious
ones
the
war
was
in
our
house
as
it
had
never
been
before
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
my
boy
and
yet
all
the
time
i
had
to
go
on
i
had
to
carry
on
as
john
was
always
bidding
his
men
do
i
had
to
appear
daily
before
my
audiences
and
laugh
and
sing
that
i
might
make
them
laugh
and
so
be
better
able
to
do
their
part
they
had
made
me
understand
my
friends
by
that
time
that
it
was
really
right
for
me
to
carry
on
with
my
own
work
i
had
not
thought
so
at
first
i
had
felt
that
it
was
wrong
for
me
to
be
singing
at
such
a
time
but
they
showed
me
that
i
was
influencing
thousands
to
do
their
duty
in
one
way
or
another
and
that
i
was
helping
to
keep
up
the
spirit
of
britain
too
never
forget
the
part
that
plays
harry
my
friends
told
me
that
the
thing
the
hun
ca
understand
he
thought
the
british
would
be
poor
fighters
because
they
went
into
action
with
a
laugh
but
that
the
thing
that
makes
them
invincible
you
your
part
to
do
in
keeping
up
that
spirit
so
i
went
on
but
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
oftentimes
letters
were
not
what
made
my
heart
heavy
there
was
good
cheer
in
everyone
of
them
he
told
us
as
much
as
the
censor
rules
would
let
him
of
the
front
and
of
conditions
as
he
found
them
they
were
still
bad
cruelly
bad
but
there
was
no
word
of
complaint
from
john
the
germans
still
had
the
best
of
us
in
guns
in
those
days
although
we
were
beginning
to
catch
up
with
them
and
they
knew
more
about
making
themselves
comfortable
in
the
trenches
than
did
our
boys
no
wonder
they
spent
years
of
planning
and
making
ready
for
this
war
and
it
has
not
taken
us
so
long
all
things
considered
to
catch
up
with
them
john
letters
were
cheery
and
they
came
regularly
too
for
a
time
but
i
suppose
it
was
because
they
left
out
so
much
because
there
was
so
great
a
part
of
my
boy
life
that
was
hidden
from
me
that
i
found
myself
thinking
more
and
more
of
john
as
a
wee
bairn
and
as
a
lad
growing
up
he
was
a
real
boy
he
had
the
real
boy
spirit
of
fun
and
mischief
there
was
a
story
i
had
often
told
of
him
that
came
to
my
mind
now
we
were
living
in
glasgow
one
drizzly
day
lauder
kept
john
in
the
house
and
he
spent
the
time
standing
at
the
parlor
window
looking
down
on
the
street
apparently
innocently
interested
in
the
passing
traffic
in
glasgow
it
is
the
custom
for
the
coal
dealers
to
go
along
the
streets
with
their
lorries
crying
their
wares
much
after
the
manner
of
a
vegetable
peddler
in
america
if
a
housewife
wants
any
coal
she
goes
to
the
window
when
she
hears
the
hail
of
the
coal
man
and
holds
up
a
finger
or
two
fingers
according
to
the
number
of
sacks
of
coal
she
wants
to
lauder
surprise
and
finally
to
her
great
vexation
coal
men
came
tramping
up
our
stairs
every
few
minutes
all
afternoon
each
one
staggering
under
the
weight
of
a
hundredweight
sack
of
coal
she
had
ordered
no
coal
and
she
wanted
no
coal
but
still
the
coal
men
came
a
veritable
pest
of
them
they
kept
coming
too
until
she
discovered
that
little
john
was
the
author
of
their
grimy
pilgrimages
to
our
door
he
was
signalling
every
passing
lorrie
from
the
window
in
the
glasgow
coal
code
i
watched
him
from
that
window
another
day
when
he
was
quarreling
with
a
number
of
playmates
in
the
street
below
the
quarrel
finally
ended
in
a
fight
john
was
giving
one
lad
a
pretty
good
pegging
when
the
others
decided
that
the
battle
was
too
much
his
way
and
jumped
on
him
john
promptly
executed
a
strategic
retreat
he
retreated
with
considerable
speed
too
i
saw
him
running
i
heard
the
patter
of
his
feet
on
our
stairs
and
a
banging
at
our
door
i
opened
it
and
admitted
a
flushed
disheveled
little
warrior
and
i
heard
the
other
boys
shouting
up
the
stairs
what
they
would
do
to
him
by
the
time
i
got
the
door
closed
and
got
back
to
our
little
parlor
john
was
standing
at
the
window
giving
a
marvelous
pantomime
for
the
benefit
of
his
enemies
in
the
street
he
was
putting
his
small
clenched
fist
now
to
his
nose
and
now
to
his
jaw
to
indicate
to
the
youngsters
what
he
was
going
to
do
to
them
later
on
those
and
a
hundred
other
little
incidents
were
as
fresh
in
my
memory
as
if
they
had
only
occurred
yesterday
his
mother
and
i
recalled
them
over
and
over
again
from
the
day
john
was
born
it
seems
to
me
the
only
things
that
really
interested
me
were
the
things
in
which
he
was
concerned
i
used
to
tuck
him
in
his
crib
at
night
the
affairs
of
his
babyhood
were
far
more
important
to
me
than
my
own
personal
affairs
i
watched
him
grow
and
develop
with
enormous
pride
and
he
took
great
pride
in
me
that
to
me
was
far
sweeter
than
praise
from
crowned
heads
soon
he
was
my
constant
companion
he
was
my
business
confidant
more
he
was
my
most
intimate
friend
there
were
no
secrets
between
us
i
think
that
john
and
i
talked
of
things
that
few
fathers
and
sons
have
the
courage
to
discuss
he
never
feared
to
ask
my
advice
on
any
subject
and
i
never
feared
to
give
it
to
him
i
wish
you
could
have
known
my
son
as
he
was
to
me
i
wish
all
fathers
could
know
their
sons
as
i
knew
john
he
was
the
most
brilliant
conversationalist
i
have
ever
known
he
was
my
ideal
musician
he
took
up
music
only
as
an
accomplishment
however
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
performer
although
he
had
amazing
natural
talent
in
that
direction
music
was
born
in
him
he
could
transpose
a
melody
in
any
key
you
could
whistle
an
air
for
him
and
he
could
turn
it
into
a
little
opera
at
once
however
he
was
anxious
to
make
for
himself
in
some
other
line
of
endeavor
and
while
he
was
often
my
piano
accompanist
he
never
had
any
intention
of
going
on
the
stage
when
he
was
fifteen
years
old
i
was
commanded
to
appear
before
king
edward
who
was
a
guest
at
rufford
abbey
the
seat
of
lord
and
lady
sayville
situated
in
a
district
called
the
dukeries
and
i
took
john
as
my
accompanist
i
gave
my
usual
performance
and
while
i
was
making
my
changes
john
played
the
piano
at
the
close
king
edward
sent
for
me
and
thanked
me
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
me
but
a
prouder
moment
came
when
the
king
spoke
of
john
playing
and
thanked
him
for
his
part
in
the
entertainment
there
were
curious
contradictions
it
often
seemed
to
me
in
john
his
uncle
tom
vallance
was
in
his
day
one
of
the
very
greatest
football
players
in
scotland
but
john
never
greatly
liked
the
game
he
thought
it
was
too
rough
he
thought
any
game
was
a
poor
game
in
which
players
were
likely
to
be
hurt
and
yet
he
had
been
eager
for
the
rough
game
of
war
the
roughest
game
of
all
ah
but
that
was
not
a
game
to
him
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
went
to
war
with
a
light
heart
as
they
might
have
entered
upon
a
football
match
all
honor
to
those
who
went
into
the
war
so
they
played
a
great
part
and
a
noble
part
but
there
were
more
who
went
to
war
as
my
boy
did
taking
it
upon
themselves
as
a
duty
and
a
solemn
obligation
they
had
no
illusions
they
did
not
love
war
no
john
hated
war
and
the
black
ugly
horrors
of
it
but
there
were
things
he
hated
more
than
he
hated
war
and
one
was
a
peace
won
through
submission
to
injustice
have
i
told
you
how
my
boy
looked
he
was
slender
but
he
was
strong
and
wiry
he
was
about
five
feet
five
inches
tall
he
topped
his
dad
by
a
handspan
and
he
was
the
neatest
boy
you
might
ever
have
hoped
to
see
aye
but
he
did
not
inherit
that
from
me
indeed
he
used
to
reproach
me
oftentimes
for
being
careless
about
my
clothes
my
collar
would
be
loose
perhaps
or
my
waistcoat
would
not
fit
just
so
he
not
like
that
and
he
would
tell
me
so
when
he
did
that
i
would
tell
him
of
times
when
he
was
a
wee
boy
and
would
come
in
from
play
with
a
dirty
face
how
his
mother
would
order
him
to
wash
and
how
he
would
painstakingly
mop
off
just
enough
of
his
features
to
leave
a
dark
ring
abaft
his
cheeks
and
above
his
eyes
and
below
his
chin
you
wash
your
face
but
never
let
on
to
your
neck
i
would
tell
him
when
he
was
a
wee
laddie
he
had
a
habit
then
of
parting
and
brushing
about
an
inch
of
his
hair
leaving
the
rest
all
my
recollection
of
that
boyhood
habit
served
me
as
a
defense
in
later
years
when
he
would
call
my
attention
to
my
own
disordered
hair
i
linger
long
and
i
linger
lovingly
over
these
small
details
because
they
are
part
of
my
daily
thoughts
every
day
some
little
incident
comes
up
to
remind
me
of
my
boy
a
battered
old
hamper
in
which
i
carry
my
different
character
stands
in
my
dressing
room
it
was
john
favorite
seat
every
time
i
look
at
it
i
have
a
vision
of
a
tiny
boy
perched
on
the
lid
watching
me
make
ready
for
the
stage
a
lump
rises
unbidden
in
my
throat
in
all
his
life
i
never
had
to
admonish
my
son
once
not
once
he
was
the
most
considerate
lad
i
have
ever
known
he
was
always
thinking
of
others
he
was
always
doing
for
others
it
was
with
such
thoughts
as
these
that
john
mother
and
i
filled
in
the
time
between
his
letters
they
came
as
if
by
a
schedule
we
knew
what
post
should
bring
one
and
once
or
twice
a
letter
was
a
post
late
and
our
hearts
were
in
our
throats
with
fear
and
then
came
a
day
when
there
should
have
been
a
letter
and
none
came
the
whole
day
passed
i
tried
to
comfort
john
mother
i
tried
to
believe
myself
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
mischance
of
the
post
but
it
was
not
that
we
could
do
nought
but
wait
ah
but
the
folks
at
home
in
britain
know
all
too
well
those
sinister
breaks
in
the
chains
of
letters
from
the
front
such
a
break
may
mean
nothing
or
anything
for
us
news
came
quickly
but
it
was
not
a
letter
from
john
that
came
to
us
it
was
a
telegram
from
the
war
office
and
it
told
us
no
more
than
that
our
boy
was
wounded
and
in
hospital
chapter
vi
wounded
and
in
hospital
that
might
have
meant
anything
and
for
a
whole
week
that
was
all
we
knew
to
hope
for
word
more
definite
until
and
unless
john
himself
could
send
us
a
message
appeared
to
be
hopeless
every
effort
we
made
ended
in
failure
and
indeed
at
such
a
time
private
inquiries
could
not
well
be
made
the
messages
that
had
to
do
with
the
war
and
with
the
business
of
the
armies
had
to
be
dealt
with
first
but
at
last
after
a
week
in
which
his
mother
and
i
almost
went
mad
with
anxiety
there
came
a
note
from
our
laddie
himself
he
told
us
not
to
fret
that
all
that
ailed
him
was
that
his
nose
was
split
and
his
wrist
bashed
up
a
bit
his
mother
looked
at
me
and
i
at
her
it
seemed
bad
enough
to
us
but
he
made
light
of
his
wounds
aye
and
he
was
right
when
i
thought
of
men
i
seen
in
hospitals
men
with
wounds
so
frightful
that
they
may
not
be
told
of
i
rejoiced
that
john
had
fared
so
well
and
i
hoped
too
that
his
wounds
would
bring
him
home
to
us
to
blighty
as
the
tommies
were
beginning
to
call
britain
but
his
wounds
were
not
serious
enough
for
that
and
so
soon
as
they
were
healed
he
went
back
to
the
trenches
do
worry
about
me
he
wrote
to
us
lots
of
fellows
out
here
have
been
wounded
five
and
six
times
and
do
think
anything
of
it
i
be
all
right
so
long
as
i
do
get
knocked
out
he
did
tell
us
then
that
it
was
the
bursting
of
a
shell
that
gave
him
his
first
wounded
stripe
but
he
wrote
to
us
regularly
again
and
there
were
scarcely
any
days
in
which
a
letter
did
not
come
either
to
me
or
to
his
mother
when
one
of
those
breaks
did
come
it
was
doubly
hard
to
bear
now
for
now
we
knew
what
it
was
to
dread
the
sight
of
a
telegraph
messenger
few
homes
in
britain
there
are
that
do
not
share
that
knowledge
now
it
is
by
telegraph
from
the
war
office
that
bad
news
comes
first
and
so
with
the
memory
of
that
first
telegram
that
we
had
had
matters
were
even
worse
somehow
than
they
had
been
before
for
me
the
days
and
nights
dragged
by
as
if
they
would
never
pass
there
was
more
news
in
john
letters
now
we
took
some
comfort
from
that
i
remember
one
in
which
he
told
his
mother
how
good
a
bed
he
had
finally
made
for
himself
the
night
before
for
some
reason
he
was
without
quarters
either
a
billet
or
a
he
had
to
skirmish
around
for
he
did
not
care
to
sleep
simply
in
flanders
mud
but
at
last
he
found
two
handfuls
of
straw
and
with
them
made
his
couch
i
got
a
good
two
hours
sleep
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
i
was
perfectly
comfortable
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
too
mother
if
i
ever
get
home
after
this
experience
there
be
one
in
the
house
who
never
grumble
this
business
puts
the
grumbling
out
of
your
head
this
is
where
the
men
are
this
is
where
every
man
ought
to
be
in
another
letter
he
told
us
that
nine
of
his
men
had
been
killed
we
buried
them
last
night
he
wrote
just
as
the
sun
went
down
it
was
the
first
funeral
i
have
ever
attended
it
was
most
impressive
we
carried
the
boys
to
one
huge
grave
the
padre
said
a
prayer
and
we
lowered
the
boys
into
the
ground
and
we
all
sang
a
little
hymn
perfect
peace
then
i
called
my
men
to
attention
again
and
we
marched
straight
back
into
the
trenches
each
of
us
i
dare
say
wondering
who
would
be
the
next
john
was
promoted
for
the
second
time
in
flanders
he
was
a
captain
having
got
his
step
on
the
field
of
battle
promotion
came
swiftly
in
those
days
to
those
who
proved
themselves
worthy
and
all
of
the
few
reports
that
came
to
us
of
john
showed
us
that
he
was
a
good
officer
his
men
liked
him
and
trusted
him
and
would
follow
him
anywhere
and
little
more
than
that
can
be
said
of
any
officer
while
captain
john
lauder
was
playing
his
part
across
the
channel
i
was
still
trying
to
do
what
i
could
at
home
my
band
still
travelled
up
and
down
the
length
and
width
of
the
united
kingdom
skirling
and
drumming
and
drawing
men
by
the
score
to
the
recruiting
office
there
was
no
more
talk
now
of
a
short
war
we
knew
what
we
were
in
for
now
but
there
was
no
thought
or
talk
of
anything
save
victory
let
the
war
go
on
as
long
as
it
must
it
could
end
only
in
one
way
we
had
been
forced
into
the
fight
but
we
were
in
and
we
were
in
to
stay
john
writing
from
france
was
no
more
determined
than
those
at
home
it
was
not
very
long
before
there
came
again
a
break
in
letters
we
were
used
to
the
days
far
apart
that
brought
no
word
not
until
the
second
day
and
the
third
day
passed
without
a
word
did
lauder
and
i
confess
our
terrors
and
our
anxiety
to
ourselves
and
one
another
this
time
our
suspense
was
comparatively
word
came
that
john
was
in
hospital
again
at
the
duke
of
hospital
at
le
toquet
in
france
this
time
he
was
not
wounded
he
was
suffering
from
dysentery
fever
and
a
nervous
breakdown
that
was
what
staggered
his
mother
and
me
a
nervous
breakdown
we
could
not
reconcile
the
john
we
knew
with
the
idea
that
the
words
conveyed
to
us
he
had
been
high
strung
to
be
sure
and
sensitive
but
never
had
he
been
the
sort
of
boy
of
whom
to
expect
a
breakdown
so
severe
as
this
must
be
if
they
had
sent
him
to
the
hospital
we
could
only
wait
to
hear
from
him
however
and
it
was
several
weeks
before
he
was
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
write
to
us
there
was
no
hint
of
discouragement
in
what
he
wrote
then
on
the
contrary
he
kept
on
trying
to
reassure
us
and
if
he
ever
grew
downhearted
he
made
it
his
business
to
see
that
we
did
not
suspect
it
here
is
one
of
his
letters
like
most
of
them
it
was
not
about
himself
i
had
a
sad
experience
yesterday
he
wrote
to
me
it
was
the
first
day
i
was
able
to
be
out
of
bed
and
i
went
over
to
a
piano
in
a
corner
against
the
wall
sat
down
and
began
playing
very
softly
more
to
myself
than
anything
else
one
of
the
nurses
came
to
me
and
said
a
captain
webster
of
the
gordon
highlanders
who
lay
on
a
bed
in
the
same
ward
wanted
to
speak
to
me
she
said
he
had
asked
who
was
playing
and
she
had
told
him
captain
lauder
harry
lauder
son
he
said
know
harry
lauder
very
well
ask
captain
lauder
to
come
here
this
man
had
gone
through
ten
operations
in
less
than
a
week
i
thought
perhaps
my
playing
had
disturbed
him
but
when
i
went
to
his
bedside
he
grasped
my
hand
pressed
it
with
what
little
strength
he
had
left
and
thanked
me
he
asked
me
if
i
could
play
a
hymn
he
said
he
would
like
to
hear
kindly
light
so
i
went
back
to
the
piano
and
played
it
as
softly
and
as
gently
as
i
could
it
was
his
last
request
he
died
an
hour
later
i
was
very
glad
i
was
able
to
soothe
his
last
moments
a
little
i
am
very
glad
now
i
learned
the
hymn
at
sunday
school
as
a
boy
illustration
on
were
the
last
words
of
my
boy
captain
john
lauder
to
his
men
but
he
would
mean
them
for
me
too
see
soon
after
we
received
that
letter
there
came
what
we
could
not
but
think
great
news
john
was
ordered
home
he
was
invalided
to
be
sure
and
i
warned
his
mother
that
she
must
be
prepared
for
a
shock
when
she
saw
him
but
no
matter
how
ill
he
was
we
would
have
our
lad
with
us
for
a
space
and
for
that
much
british
fathers
and
mothers
had
learned
to
be
grateful
i
had
warned
john
mother
but
it
was
i
who
was
shocked
when
i
saw
him
first
on
the
day
he
came
back
to
our
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
his
cheeks
were
sunken
his
eyes
very
bright
as
a
man
are
who
has
a
fever
he
was
weak
and
thin
and
there
was
no
blood
in
his
cheeks
it
was
a
sight
to
wring
one
heart
to
see
the
laddie
so
brought
down
him
who
had
looked
so
braw
and
strong
the
last
time
we
had
seen
him
that
had
been
when
he
was
setting
out
for
the
wars
you
ken
and
now
he
was
back
sae
thin
and
weak
and
pitiful
as
i
had
not
seen
him
since
he
had
been
a
bairn
in
his
mother
arms
aweel
it
was
for
us
his
mother
and
i
and
all
the
folks
at
home
to
mend
him
and
make
him
strong
again
so
he
told
us
for
he
had
but
one
thing
on
his
mind
to
get
back
to
his
men
they
be
needing
me
out
there
he
said
they
needing
men
i
must
go
back
so
soon
as
i
can
every
man
is
needed
there
you
be
needing
your
strength
back
before
you
can
be
going
back
son
i
told
him
if
you
fash
and
fret
it
will
take
you
but
so
much
the
longer
to
get
back
he
knew
that
but
he
knew
things
i
could
not
know
because
i
had
not
seen
them
he
had
seen
things
that
he
saw
over
and
over
again
when
he
tried
to
sleep
his
nerves
were
shattered
utterly
it
grieved
me
sore
not
to
spend
all
my
time
with
him
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
he
drove
me
back
to
my
work
you
must
work
on
dad
like
every
other
briton
he
said
think
of
the
part
you
playing
why
you
more
use
than
any
of
us
out
there
you
worth
a
brigade
so
i
left
him
on
the
clyde
and
went
on
about
my
work
but
i
went
back
to
dunoon
as
often
as
i
could
as
i
got
a
day
or
a
night
to
make
the
journey
at
first
there
was
small
change
of
progress
john
would
come
downstairs
about
the
middle
of
the
day
moving
slowly
and
painfully
and
he
was
listless
there
was
no
life
in
him
no
resiliency
or
spring
how
did
you
rest
son
i
would
ask
him
he
always
smiled
when
he
answered
oh
fairly
well
he
tell
me
i
fought
three
or
four
battles
though
before
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
he
had
come
to
the
right
place
to
be
cured
though
and
his
mother
was
the
nurse
he
needed
it
was
quiet
in
the
hills
of
the
clyde
and
there
was
rest
and
healing
in
the
heather
about
dunoon
soon
his
sleep
became
better
and
less
troubled
by
dreams
he
could
eat
more
too
and
they
saw
to
it
at
home
that
he
ate
all
they
could
stuff
into
him
so
it
was
a
surprisingly
short
time
considering
how
bad
he
had
looked
when
he
first
came
back
to
dunoon
before
he
was
in
good
health
and
spirits
again
there
was
a
bonnie
wee
lassie
who
was
to
become
john
lauder
ere
so
long
she
helped
our
boy
too
to
get
back
his
strength
soon
he
was
ordered
from
home
for
a
time
he
had
only
light
duties
with
the
home
reserve
then
he
went
to
school
i
laughed
when
he
told
me
he
had
been
ordered
to
school
but
he
didna
crack
a
smile
you
need
be
laughing
he
said
it
a
bombing
school
i
going
to
if
you
away
from
the
front
for
a
few
weeks
you
find
everything
changed
when
you
get
back
bombing
is
going
to
be
important
john
did
so
well
in
the
bombing
school
that
he
was
made
an
instructor
and
assigned
for
a
while
to
teach
others
but
he
was
impatient
to
be
back
with
his
own
men
and
they
were
clamoring
for
him
and
so
on
september
his
mother
and
i
bade
him
again
and
he
went
back
to
france
and
the
men
his
heart
was
wrapped
up
in
yon
where
the
men
are
dad
he
said
to
me
just
before
he
started
chapter
vii
john
mother
his
sweetheart
and
i
all
saw
him
off
at
glasgow
the
fear
was
in
all
our
hearts
and
i
think
it
must
have
been
in
all
our
eyes
as
well
the
fear
that
every
father
and
mother
and
sweetheart
in
britain
shared
with
us
in
these
days
whenever
they
saw
a
boy
off
for
france
and
the
trenches
was
it
for
the
last
time
were
we
seeing
him
now
so
strong
and
hale
and
hearty
only
to
have
to
go
the
rest
of
our
lives
with
no
more
than
a
memory
of
him
to
keep
aweel
we
could
not
be
telling
that
we
could
only
hope
and
pray
and
we
had
learned
again
to
pray
long
since
i
have
wondered
often
and
lauder
has
wondered
with
me
what
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
britain
would
do
in
these
black
days
without
prayer
to
guide
them
and
sustain
them
so
we
could
but
stand
there
keeping
back
our
tears
and
our
fears
and
hoping
for
the
best
one
thing
was
sure
we
might
not
let
the
laddie
see
how
close
we
were
to
greeting
it
was
for
us
to
be
so
brave
as
god
would
let
us
be
it
was
hard
for
him
he
was
no
boy
you
ken
going
blindly
and
gayly
to
a
great
adventure
he
had
need
of
the
finest
courage
and
devotion
a
man
could
muster
that
day
for
he
knew
fully
now
what
it
was
that
he
was
going
back
to
he
knew
the
hell
the
huns
had
made
of
war
which
had
been
bad
enough
in
all
conscience
before
they
did
their
part
to
make
it
worse
and
he
was
high
strung
he
could
live
over
and
i
make
no
doubt
he
did
in
those
days
after
he
had
his
orders
to
go
back
every
grim
and
dreadful
thing
that
was
waiting
for
him
out
there
he
had
been
through
it
all
and
he
was
going
back
he
had
come
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
now
he
was
to
ride
down
into
it
again
and
it
was
with
a
smile
he
left
us
i
shall
never
forget
that
his
thought
was
all
for
us
whom
he
was
leaving
behind
his
care
was
for
us
lest
we
should
worry
too
greatly
and
think
too
much
of
him
i
be
all
right
he
told
us
you
not
to
fret
about
me
any
of
you
a
man
does
take
his
chances
out
there
but
they
the
chances
every
man
must
take
these
days
if
he
a
man
at
all
i
rather
be
taking
them
than
be
safe
at
home
we
did
our
best
to
match
the
laddie
spirit
and
be
worthy
of
him
but
it
was
cruelly
hard
we
had
lost
him
and
found
him
again
and
now
he
was
being
taken
from
us
for
the
second
time
it
was
harder
much
harder
to
see
him
go
this
second
time
than
it
had
been
at
first
and
it
had
been
hard
enough
then
and
bad
enough
but
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
so
much
we
knew
it
was
a
thing
ordered
and
inevitable
and
it
was
not
many
days
before
we
had
slipped
back
into
the
way
things
had
been
before
john
was
invalided
home
it
is
a
strange
thing
about
life
the
way
that
one
can
become
used
to
things
so
it
was
with
us
strange
things
terrible
things
outrageous
things
that
in
time
of
peace
we
would
never
have
dared
so
much
as
to
think
possible
came
to
be
the
matters
of
every
day
for
us
it
was
so
with
john
we
came
to
think
of
it
as
natural
that
he
should
be
away
from
us
and
in
peril
of
his
life
every
minute
of
every
hour
it
was
not
easier
for
us
indeed
it
was
harder
than
it
had
been
before
just
as
it
had
been
harder
for
us
to
say
the
second
time
but
we
thought
less
often
of
the
strangeness
of
it
we
were
really
growing
used
to
the
war
and
it
was
less
the
monstrous
strange
thing
than
it
had
been
in
our
daily
lives
war
had
become
our
daily
life
and
portion
in
britain
all
who
were
not
slackers
were
doing
their
part
every
one
man
and
woman
and
child
were
in
it
making
sacrifices
those
happy
days
of
peace
lay
far
behind
us
and
we
had
lost
our
touch
with
them
and
our
memory
of
them
was
growing
dim
we
were
all
in
it
we
had
all
to
suffer
alike
we
were
all
in
the
same
boat
we
mothers
and
fathers
and
sweethearts
of
britain
and
so
it
was
easier
for
us
not
to
think
too
much
and
too
often
of
our
own
griefs
and
cares
and
anxieties
john
letters
began
to
come
again
in
a
steady
stream
he
was
as
careful
as
ever
about
writing
there
was
scarcely
a
day
that
did
not
bring
its
letter
to
one
of
the
three
of
us
and
what
bonnie
brave
letters
they
were
they
were
as
cheerful
and
as
bright
as
his
first
letters
had
been
if
john
had
bad
hours
and
bad
days
out
there
he
would
not
let
us
know
it
he
told
us
what
news
there
was
and
he
was
always
cheerful
and
bright
when
he
wrote
he
let
no
hint
of
discouragement
creep
into
anything
he
wrote
to
us
he
thought
of
others
first
always
and
all
the
time
of
his
men
and
of
us
at
home
he
was
quite
cured
and
well
he
told
us
and
going
back
had
done
him
good
instead
of
harm
he
wrote
to
us
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
come
home
he
felt
you
ken
that
it
was
there
in
france
and
in
the
trenches
that
men
should
feel
at
home
in
those
days
and
not
safe
in
britain
by
their
ain
firesides
it
was
not
easy
for
me
to
be
cheerful
and
comfortable
about
him
though
i
had
my
work
to
do
i
tried
to
do
it
as
well
as
i
could
for
i
knew
that
that
would
please
him
my
band
still
went
up
and
down
the
country
getting
recruits
and
i
was
speaking
too
and
urging
men
myself
to
go
out
and
join
the
lads
who
were
fighting
and
dying
for
them
in
france
they
told
me
i
was
doing
good
work
that
i
was
a
great
force
in
the
war
and
i
did
indeed
get
many
a
word
and
many
a
handshake
from
men
who
told
me
i
had
induced
them
to
enlist
i
glad
i
heard
you
harry
man
after
man
said
to
me
you
showed
me
what
i
should
be
doing
and
i
been
easier
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
put
on
the
khaki
i
knew
they
never
regret
it
no
matter
what
came
to
them
no
man
will
that
done
his
duty
it
the
slackers
who
could
or
would
see
their
duty
men
should
feel
sorry
for
it
not
the
lads
who
gave
everything
and
made
the
final
sacrifice
it
was
hard
for
me
to
go
on
with
my
work
of
making
folks
laugh
it
had
been
growing
harder
steadily
ever
since
i
had
come
home
from
america
and
that
long
voyage
of
mine
to
australia
and
had
seen
what
war
was
and
what
it
was
doing
to
britain
but
i
carried
on
and
did
the
best
i
could
that
winter
i
was
in
the
big
revue
at
the
shaftesbury
theatre
in
london
that
was
called
three
cheers
it
was
one
of
the
gay
shows
that
london
liked
because
it
gave
some
relief
from
the
war
and
made
the
zeppelin
raids
that
the
huns
were
beginning
to
make
so
often
now
a
little
easier
to
bear
and
it
was
a
great
place
for
the
men
who
were
back
from
france
it
was
partly
because
of
them
that
i
could
go
on
as
i
did
we
owed
them
all
we
could
give
them
and
when
they
came
back
from
the
mud
and
the
grime
and
the
dreariness
of
the
trenches
they
needed
something
to
cheer
them
up
needed
the
sort
of
production
we
gave
them
a
man
who
has
two
days
leave
in
london
does
not
want
to
see
a
serious
play
or
a
problem
drama
as
a
rule
he
wants
something
light
with
lots
of
pretty
girls
and
jolly
tunes
and
people
to
make
him
laugh
and
we
gave
him
that
the
house
was
full
of
officers
and
men
night
after
night
soon
word
came
from
john
that
he
was
to
have
leave
just
after
christmas
that
would
bring
him
home
for
the
new
year
holidays
his
mother
went
home
to
make
things
ready
for
john
was
to
be
married
when
he
got
his
leave
i
had
my
plans
all
made
i
meant
to
build
a
wee
hoose
for
the
two
of
them
near
our
own
hoose
at
dunoon
so
that
we
might
be
all
together
even
though
my
laddie
was
in
a
home
of
his
own
and
i
counted
the
hours
and
the
days
against
the
time
when
john
would
be
home
again
while
we
were
playing
at
the
shaftesbury
i
lived
at
an
hotel
in
southampton
row
called
the
bonnington
but
it
was
lonely
for
me
there
on
new
year
eve
it
fell
on
a
sunday
tom
vallance
my
asked
me
to
tea
with
him
and
his
family
in
clapham
where
he
lived
that
is
a
pleasant
place
a
suburb
of
london
on
the
southwest
and
i
was
glad
to
go
and
so
i
drove
out
with
a
friend
of
mine
in
a
taxicab
and
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
crowded
part
of
the
city
for
a
time
i
did
not
feel
right
that
day
holiday
times
were
bad
hard
times
for
me
then
we
had
always
made
so
much
of
christmas
and
here
was
the
third
christmas
that
our
boy
had
been
away
and
so
i
was
depressed
and
then
there
had
been
no
word
for
me
from
john
for
a
day
or
two
i
was
not
worried
for
i
thought
it
likely
that
his
mother
or
his
sweetheart
had
heard
and
had
not
time
yet
to
let
me
know
but
whatever
the
reason
i
was
depressed
and
blue
and
i
could
not
enter
into
the
festive
spirit
that
folk
were
trying
to
keep
alive
despite
the
war
i
must
have
been
poor
company
during
that
ride
to
clapham
in
the
taxicab
we
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
my
friend
and
i
did
not
feel
like
talking
and
he
respected
my
mood
and
kept
quiet
himself
i
felt
at
last
that
i
ought
to
apologize
to
him
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
i
told
him
i
simply
want
to
talk
i
feel
sad
and
lonely
i
wonder
if
my
boy
is
all
right
of
course
he
is
my
friend
told
me
cheer
up
harry
this
is
a
time
when
no
news
is
good
news
if
anything
were
wrong
with
him
they
let
you
know
well
i
knew
that
too
and
i
tried
to
cheer
up
and
feel
better
so
that
i
would
not
spoil
the
pleasure
of
the
others
at
tom
house
i
tried
to
picture
john
as
i
thought
he
must
be
well
and
happy
and
smiling
the
old
familiar
boyish
smile
i
knew
so
well
i
had
sent
him
a
box
of
cigars
only
a
few
days
before
and
he
would
be
handing
it
around
among
his
fellow
officers
i
knew
that
but
it
was
no
use
i
could
think
of
john
but
it
was
only
with
sorrow
and
longing
and
i
wondered
if
this
same
time
in
a
year
would
see
him
still
out
there
in
the
trenches
would
this
war
ever
end
and
so
the
shadows
still
hung
about
me
when
we
reached
tom
house
they
made
me
very
welcome
did
tom
and
all
his
family
they
tried
to
cheer
me
and
tom
did
all
he
could
to
make
me
feel
better
and
to
reassure
me
but
i
was
still
depressed
when
we
left
the
house
and
began
the
drive
back
to
london
it
the
holiday
i
out
of
gear
with
that
i
thinking
i
told
my
friend
he
was
going
to
join
two
other
friends
and
with
them
to
see
the
new
year
in
in
an
old
fashioned
way
and
he
wanted
me
to
join
them
but
i
did
not
feel
up
to
it
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
anything
of
the
sort
no
no
i
go
home
and
turn
in
i
told
him
i
too
dull
tonight
to
be
good
company
he
hoped
as
we
all
did
that
this
new
year
that
was
coming
would
bring
victory
and
peace
peace
could
not
come
without
victory
we
were
all
agreed
on
that
but
we
all
hoped
that
the
new
year
would
bring
both
the
new
year
of
and
so
i
left
him
at
the
corner
of
southhampton
row
and
went
back
to
my
hotel
alone
it
was
about
midnight
a
little
before
i
think
when
i
got
in
and
one
of
the
porters
had
a
message
for
me
sir
thomas
lipton
rang
you
up
he
said
and
wants
you
to
speak
with
him
when
you
come
in
i
rang
him
up
at
home
directly
happy
new
year
when
it
comes
harry
he
said
he
spoke
in
the
same
bluff
hearty
way
he
always
did
he
fairly
shouted
in
my
ear
when
did
you
hear
from
the
boy
are
you
and
lauder
well
aye
fine
i
told
him
and
i
told
him
my
last
news
of
john
splendid
he
said
well
it
was
just
to
talk
to
you
a
minute
that
i
rang
you
up
harry
happy
new
year
again
i
went
to
bed
then
but
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
it
was
new
year
and
i
lay
thinking
of
my
boy
and
wondering
what
this
year
would
bring
him
it
was
early
in
the
morning
before
i
slept
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
scarce
been
asleep
at
all
when
there
came
a
pounding
at
the
door
loud
enough
to
rouse
the
heaviest
sleeper
there
ever
was
my
heart
almost
stopped
there
must
be
something
serious
indeed
for
them
to
be
rousing
me
so
early
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
there
was
a
porter
holding
out
a
telegram
i
took
it
and
tore
it
open
and
i
knew
why
i
had
felt
as
i
had
the
day
before
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
read
captain
john
lauder
killed
in
action
december
official
war
office
it
had
gone
to
lauder
at
dunoon
first
and
she
had
sent
it
on
to
me
that
was
all
it
said
i
knew
nothing
of
how
my
boy
had
died
or
where
save
that
it
was
for
his
country
but
later
i
learned
that
when
sir
thomas
lipton
had
rung
me
up
he
had
intended
to
condole
with
me
he
had
heard
on
saturday
of
my
death
but
when
he
spoke
to
me
and
understood
at
once
from
the
tone
of
my
voice
that
i
did
not
know
he
had
not
been
able
to
go
on
his
heart
was
too
tender
to
make
it
possible
for
him
to
be
the
one
to
give
me
that
blow
the
heaviest
that
ever
befell
me
chapter
viii
it
was
on
monday
morning
january
the
first
that
i
learned
of
my
boy
death
and
he
had
been
killed
the
thursday
before
he
had
been
dead
four
days
before
i
knew
it
and
yet
i
had
known
let
no
one
ever
tell
me
again
that
there
is
nothing
in
presentiment
why
else
had
i
been
so
sad
and
uneasy
in
my
mind
why
else
all
through
that
sunday
had
it
been
so
impossible
for
me
to
take
comfort
in
what
was
said
to
cheer
me
some
warning
had
come
to
me
some
sense
that
all
was
not
well
realization
came
to
me
slowly
i
sat
and
stared
at
that
slip
of
paper
that
had
come
to
me
like
the
breath
of
doom
dead
dead
these
four
days
i
was
never
to
see
the
light
of
his
eyes
again
i
was
never
to
hear
that
laugh
of
his
i
had
looked
on
my
boy
for
the
last
time
could
it
be
true
ah
i
knew
it
was
and
it
was
for
this
moment
that
i
had
been
waiting
that
we
had
all
been
waiting
ever
since
we
had
sent
john
away
to
fight
for
his
country
and
do
his
part
i
think
we
had
all
felt
that
it
must
come
we
had
all
known
that
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
he
should
be
one
of
those
to
be
spared
the
black
despair
that
had
been
hovering
over
me
for
hours
closed
down
now
and
enveloped
all
my
senses
everything
was
unreal
for
a
time
i
was
quite
numb
but
then
as
i
began
to
realize
and
to
visualize
what
it
was
to
mean
in
my
life
that
my
boy
was
dead
there
came
a
great
pain
the
iron
of
realization
slowly
seared
every
word
of
that
curt
telegram
upon
my
heart
i
said
it
to
myself
over
and
over
again
and
i
whispered
to
myself
as
my
thoughts
took
form
over
and
over
the
one
terrible
word
dead
i
felt
that
for
me
everything
had
come
to
an
end
with
the
reading
of
that
dire
message
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
me
the
board
of
life
was
black
and
blank
for
me
there
was
no
past
and
there
could
be
no
future
everything
had
been
swept
away
erased
by
one
sweep
of
the
hand
of
a
cruel
fate
oh
there
was
a
past
though
and
it
was
in
that
past
that
i
began
to
delve
it
was
made
up
of
every
memory
i
had
of
my
boy
i
fell
at
once
to
remembering
him
i
clutched
at
every
memory
as
if
i
must
grasp
them
and
make
sure
of
them
lest
they
be
taken
from
me
as
well
as
the
hope
of
seeing
him
again
that
the
telegram
had
forever
snatched
away
i
would
have
been
destitute
indeed
then
it
was
as
if
i
must
fix
in
my
mind
the
way
he
had
been
wont
to
look
and
recall
to
my
ears
every
tone
of
his
voice
every
trick
of
his
speech
there
was
something
left
of
him
that
i
must
keep
i
knew
even
then
at
all
costs
if
i
was
to
be
able
to
bear
his
loss
at
all
there
was
a
vision
of
him
before
my
eyes
my
bonnie
highland
laddie
brave
and
strong
in
his
kilt
and
the
uniform
of
his
country
going
out
to
his
death
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
there
was
another
vision
that
came
up
now
unbidden
it
was
a
vision
of
him
lying
stark
and
cold
upon
the
battlefield
the
mud
on
his
uniform
and
when
i
saw
that
vision
i
was
like
a
man
gone
mad
and
possessed
of
devils
who
had
stolen
away
his
faculties
i
cursed
war
as
i
saw
that
vision
and
the
men
who
caused
war
and
when
i
thought
of
the
germans
who
had
killed
my
boy
a
terrible
and
savage
hatred
swept
me
and
i
longed
to
go
out
there
and
kill
with
my
bare
hands
until
i
had
avenged
him
or
they
had
killed
me
too
but
then
i
was
a
little
softened
i
thought
of
his
mother
back
in
our
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
and
the
thought
of
her
bereft
even
as
i
was
sorrowing
even
as
i
was
and
lost
in
her
frightful
loneliness
was
pitiful
so
that
i
had
but
the
one
desire
and
wish
to
go
to
her
and
join
my
tears
with
hers
that
we
who
were
left
alone
to
bear
our
grief
might
bear
it
together
and
give
one
to
the
other
such
comfort
as
there
might
be
in
life
for
us
and
so
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
prayed
there
in
my
lonely
room
in
the
hotel
i
prayed
to
god
that
he
might
give
us
both
john
mother
and
myself
strength
to
bear
the
blow
that
had
been
dealt
us
and
to
endure
the
sacrifice
that
he
and
our
country
had
demanded
of
us
my
friends
came
to
me
they
came
rushing
to
me
never
did
man
have
better
friends
and
kindlier
friends
than
mine
proved
themselves
to
me
on
that
day
of
sorrow
they
did
all
that
good
men
and
women
could
do
but
there
was
no
help
for
me
in
the
ministration
of
friends
i
was
beyond
the
power
of
human
words
to
comfort
or
solace
i
was
glad
of
their
kindness
and
the
memory
of
it
now
is
a
precious
one
and
one
i
would
not
be
without
but
at
such
a
time
i
could
not
gain
from
them
what
they
were
eager
to
give
me
i
could
only
bow
my
head
and
pray
for
strength
that
night
that
new
year
night
that
i
shall
never
forget
no
matter
how
long
god
may
let
me
live
i
went
north
i
took
train
from
london
to
glasgow
and
the
next
day
i
came
to
our
wee
hoose
a
sad
lonely
wee
hoose
it
had
become
now
on
the
clyde
at
dunoon
and
was
with
john
mother
it
was
the
place
for
me
it
was
there
that
i
wanted
to
be
and
it
was
with
her
who
must
hereafter
be
all
the
world
to
me
and
i
was
eager
to
be
with
her
too
who
had
given
john
to
me
sore
as
my
grief
was
stricken
as
i
was
i
could
comfort
her
as
no
one
else
could
hope
to
do
and
she
could
do
as
much
for
me
we
belonged
together
i
can
scarce
remember
even
for
myself
what
happened
there
at
dunoon
i
can
not
tell
you
what
i
said
or
what
i
did
or
what
words
and
what
thoughts
passed
between
john
mother
and
myself
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
do
know
and
that
i
will
tell
you
almighty
god
to
whom
we
prayed
was
kind
and
he
was
pitiful
and
merciful
for
presently
he
brought
us
both
a
sort
of
sad
composure
presently
he
assuaged
our
grief
a
little
and
gave
us
the
strength
that
we
must
have
to
meet
the
needs
of
life
and
the
thought
of
going
on
in
a
world
that
was
darkened
by
the
loss
of
the
boy
in
whom
all
our
thoughts
and
all
our
hopes
had
been
centred
i
thanked
god
then
and
i
thank
god
now
that
i
have
never
denied
him
nor
taken
his
name
in
vain
for
god
gave
me
great
thoughts
about
my
boy
and
about
his
death
slowly
gradually
he
made
me
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
and
he
took
away
the
sharp
agony
of
my
first
grief
and
sorrow
and
gave
me
a
sort
of
peace
john
died
in
the
most
glorious
cause
and
he
died
the
most
glorious
death
it
may
be
given
to
a
man
to
die
he
died
for
humanity
he
died
for
liberty
and
that
this
world
in
which
life
must
go
on
no
matter
how
many
die
may
be
a
better
world
to
live
in
he
died
in
a
struggle
against
the
blackest
force
and
the
direst
threat
that
has
appeared
against
liberty
and
humanity
within
the
memory
of
man
and
were
he
alive
now
and
were
he
called
again
to
go
out
for
the
same
cause
knowing
that
he
must
meet
death
as
he
did
meet
it
he
would
go
as
smilingly
and
as
willingly
as
he
went
then
he
would
go
as
a
british
soldier
and
a
british
gentleman
to
fight
and
die
for
his
king
and
his
country
and
i
would
bid
him
go
i
have
lived
through
much
since
his
death
they
have
not
let
me
take
a
rifle
or
a
sword
and
go
into
the
trenches
to
avenge
him
but
of
that
i
shall
tell
you
later
ah
it
was
not
at
once
that
i
felt
so
in
my
heart
in
those
early
days
of
grief
and
sorrow
there
was
rebellion
often
and
often
there
were
moments
when
in
my
anguish
i
cried
out
aloud
why
why
why
did
they
have
to
take
john
my
boy
my
only
child
but
god
came
to
me
and
slowly
his
peace
entered
my
soul
and
he
made
me
see
as
in
a
vision
that
some
things
that
i
had
said
and
that
i
had
believed
were
not
so
he
made
me
know
and
i
learned
straight
from
him
that
our
boy
had
not
been
taken
from
us
forever
as
i
had
said
to
myself
so
often
since
that
telegram
had
come
he
is
gone
from
this
life
but
he
is
waiting
for
us
beyond
this
life
he
is
waiting
beyond
this
life
and
this
world
of
wicked
war
and
wanton
cruelty
and
slaughter
and
we
shall
come
some
day
his
mother
and
i
to
the
place
where
he
is
waiting
for
us
and
we
shall
all
be
as
happy
there
as
we
were
on
this
earth
in
the
happy
days
before
the
war
my
eyes
will
rest
again
upon
his
face
i
will
hear
his
fresh
young
voice
again
as
he
sees
me
and
cries
out
his
greeting
i
know
what
he
will
say
he
will
spy
me
and
his
voice
will
ring
out
as
it
used
to
do
hello
dad
he
will
call
as
he
sees
me
and
i
will
feel
the
grip
of
his
young
strong
arms
about
me
just
as
in
the
happy
days
before
that
day
that
is
of
all
the
days
of
my
life
the
most
terrible
and
the
most
hateful
in
my
memory
the
day
when
they
told
me
that
he
had
been
killed
that
is
my
belief
that
is
the
comfort
that
god
has
given
me
in
my
grief
and
my
sorrow
there
is
a
god
ah
yes
there
is
a
god
times
there
are
i
know
when
some
of
those
who
look
upon
the
horrid
slaughter
of
this
war
that
is
going
on
hour
by
hour
feel
that
their
faith
is
being
shaken
by
doubts
they
think
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
blood
that
is
being
poured
out
of
the
sufferings
of
women
and
children
and
they
see
the
cause
that
is
wrong
and
foul
prospering
for
a
little
time
and
they
can
not
understand
if
there
is
a
god
they
whisper
to
themselves
why
does
he
permit
a
thing
so
wicked
to
go
on
but
there
is
a
god
there
is
i
have
seen
the
stark
horror
of
war
i
know
as
none
can
know
until
he
has
seen
it
at
close
quarters
what
a
thing
war
is
as
it
is
fought
and
i
believe
as
i
do
believe
and
as
i
shall
believe
until
the
end
because
i
know
god
comfort
and
his
grace
i
know
that
my
boy
is
surely
waiting
for
me
in
america
now
there
are
mothers
and
fathers
by
the
scores
of
thousands
who
have
bidden
their
sons
who
water
their
letters
from
france
with
their
tears
who
turn
white
at
the
sight
of
a
telegram
and
tremble
at
the
sudden
clamor
of
a
telephone
ah
i
know
i
know
i
suffered
as
they
are
suffering
and
i
have
this
to
tell
them
and
to
beg
them
they
must
believe
as
i
believe
then
shall
they
find
the
peace
and
the
comfort
that
i
have
found
so
it
was
that
there
on
the
clyde
john
mother
and
i
came
out
of
the
blackness
of
our
first
grief
we
began
to
be
able
to
talk
to
one
another
and
every
day
we
talked
of
john
we
have
never
ceased
to
do
that
his
mother
and
i
we
never
shall
we
may
not
have
him
with
us
bodily
but
his
spirit
is
never
absent
and
each
day
we
remember
some
new
thing
about
him
that
one
of
us
can
call
to
the
other
mind
and
it
is
as
if
when
we
do
that
we
bring
back
some
part
of
him
out
of
the
void
little
trifling
memories
of
when
he
was
a
baby
and
when
he
was
a
boy
growing
up
and
other
memories
of
later
days
often
and
often
it
was
the
days
that
were
furthest
away
that
we
remembered
best
of
all
and
things
connected
with
those
days
but
i
had
small
wish
to
see
others
john
mother
was
enough
for
me
she
and
the
peace
that
was
coming
to
me
on
the
clyde
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
london
i
had
no
plans
to
make
all
that
was
over
all
that
part
of
my
life
i
thought
had
ended
with
the
news
of
my
boy
death
i
wanted
no
more
than
to
stay
at
home
on
the
clyde
and
think
of
him
my
wife
and
i
did
not
even
talk
about
the
future
and
no
thing
was
further
from
all
my
thoughts
than
that
i
should
ever
step
upon
a
stage
again
what
go
out
before
an
audience
and
seek
to
make
it
laugh
sing
my
songs
when
my
heart
was
broken
i
did
not
decide
not
to
do
it
i
did
not
so
much
as
think
of
it
as
a
thing
i
had
to
decide
about
chapter
ix
and
then
one
thing
and
another
brought
the
thought
into
my
mind
so
that
i
had
to
face
it
and
tell
people
how
i
felt
about
it
there
were
neighbors
wanting
to
know
when
i
would
be
about
my
work
again
that
it
was
that
first
made
me
understand
that
others
did
not
feel
as
i
was
feeling
they
thinking
i
be
going
back
to
work
again
i
told
mother
i
canna
she
felt
as
i
did
we
could
not
see
either
one
of
us
in
our
grief
how
anyone
could
think
that
i
could
begin
again
where
i
had
left
off
i
canna
i
will
not
try
i
told
her
again
and
again
how
can
i
tak
up
again
with
that
old
mummery
how
can
i
laugh
when
my
heart
is
breaking
and
make
others
smile
when
the
tears
are
in
my
eyes
and
she
thought
as
i
did
that
i
could
not
and
that
no
one
should
be
asking
me
the
war
had
taken
much
of
what
i
had
earned
in
one
way
or
another
i
was
not
so
rich
as
i
had
been
but
there
was
enough
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
go
back
to
work
so
far
as
our
living
was
concerned
and
so
it
seemed
to
be
settled
between
us
planning
we
left
for
the
future
it
was
no
time
for
us
to
be
making
plans
it
mattered
little
enough
to
us
what
might
be
in
store
for
us
we
could
take
things
as
they
might
come
so
we
bided
quiet
in
our
home
and
talked
of
john
and
from
every
part
of
the
earth
and
from
people
in
all
walks
and
conditions
of
life
there
began
to
pour
in
upon
us
letters
and
telegrams
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
i
think
there
were
four
thousand
kindly
folk
who
remembered
us
in
our
sorrow
and
let
us
know
that
they
could
think
of
us
in
spite
of
all
the
other
care
and
trouble
that
filled
the
world
in
those
days
many
celebrated
names
were
signed
to
those
letters
and
telegrams
and
there
were
many
too
from
simple
folk
whose
very
names
i
did
not
know
who
told
me
that
i
had
given
them
cheer
and
courage
from
the
stage
and
so
they
felt
that
they
were
friends
of
mine
and
must
let
me
know
that
they
were
sorry
for
the
blow
that
had
befallen
me
then
it
came
out
that
i
meant
to
leave
the
stage
they
sent
word
from
london
at
last
to
ask
when
they
might
look
for
me
to
be
back
at
the
shaftesbury
theatre
and
when
they
found
what
it
was
in
my
mind
to
do
all
my
friends
began
to
plead
with
me
and
argue
with
me
they
said
it
was
my
duty
to
myself
to
go
back
you
too
young
a
man
to
retire
harry
they
said
what
would
you
do
how
could
you
pass
away
your
time
if
you
had
no
work
to
do
men
who
retire
at
your
age
are
always
sorry
they
wither
away
and
die
of
dry
rot
there
be
plenty
for
me
to
be
doing
i
told
them
i
not
be
idle
but
still
they
argued
i
was
not
greatly
moved
they
were
thinking
of
me
and
their
arguments
appealed
to
my
selfish
interests
and
needs
and
just
then
i
was
not
thinking
very
much
about
myself
and
then
another
sort
of
argument
came
to
me
people
wrote
to
me
men
and
women
who
like
me
had
lost
their
sons
their
letters
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
anew
they
were
tender
letters
and
beautiful
letters
most
of
them
and
letters
to
make
proud
and
glad
as
well
as
sad
the
heart
of
the
man
to
whom
they
were
written
i
will
not
copy
those
letters
down
here
for
they
were
written
for
my
eyes
and
for
no
others
but
i
can
tell
you
the
message
that
they
all
bore
do
desert
us
now
harry
it
was
so
that
they
put
it
one
after
another
in
those
letters
ah
harry
there
is
so
much
woe
and
grief
and
pain
in
the
world
that
you
who
can
must
do
all
that
is
in
your
power
to
make
them
easier
to
bear
there
are
few
forces
enough
in
the
world
to
make
us
happy
even
for
a
little
space
come
back
to
us
harry
make
us
laugh
again
it
was
when
those
letters
came
that
for
the
first
time
i
saw
that
i
had
others
to
consider
beside
myself
and
that
it
was
not
only
my
own
wishes
that
i
might
take
into
account
i
talked
to
my
wife
and
i
told
her
of
those
letters
and
there
were
tears
in
both
our
eyes
as
we
thought
about
those
folks
who
knew
the
sorrow
that
was
in
our
hearts
you
must
think
about
them
harry
she
said
and
so
i
did
think
about
them
and
then
i
began
to
find
that
there
were
others
still
about
whom
i
must
think
there
were
three
hundred
people
in
the
cast
of
three
cheers
at
the
shaftesbury
theatre
in
london
and
i
began
to
hear
now
that
unless
i
went
back
the
show
would
be
closed
and
all
of
them
would
be
out
of
work
at
that
season
of
the
year
in
the
theatrical
world
it
would
be
hard
for
them
to
find
other
engagements
and
they
were
not
most
of
them
like
me
able
to
live
without
the
salaries
from
the
show
they
wrote
to
me
many
of
them
and
begged
me
to
come
back
and
i
knew
that
it
was
a
desperate
time
for
anyone
to
be
without
employment
i
had
to
think
about
those
poor
souls
and
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
i
might
be
the
means
however
innocent
of
bringing
hardship
and
suffering
upon
others
it
might
not
be
my
fault
and
yet
it
would
lie
always
upon
my
conscience
yet
even
with
all
such
thoughts
and
prayers
to
move
me
i
did
not
see
how
i
could
yield
to
them
and
go
back
even
after
i
had
come
to
the
point
of
being
willing
to
go
back
if
i
could
i
did
not
think
i
could
go
through
with
it
i
was
afraid
i
would
break
down
if
i
tried
to
play
my
part
i
talked
to
tom
valiance
my
it
very
well
to
talk
tom
i
said
but
they
ring
the
curtain
down
on
me
i
can
never
do
it
you
must
he
said
harry
you
must
go
back
it
your
duty
what
would
the
boy
be
saying
and
having
you
do
do
you
remember
harry
john
last
words
to
his
men
were
on
that
what
it
is
they
asking
you
to
do
too
harry
and
it
what
john
would
have
wanted
it
would
be
his
wish
and
i
knew
that
he
was
right
tom
had
found
the
one
argument
that
could
really
move
me
and
make
me
see
my
duty
as
the
others
did
so
i
gave
in
i
wired
to
the
management
that
i
would
rejoin
the
cast
of
three
cheers
and
i
took
the
train
to
london
and
as
i
rode
in
the
train
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
roar
of
the
wheels
made
a
refrain
and
i
could
hear
them
pounding
out
those
two
words
in
my
boy
voice
carry
on
but
how
hard
it
was
to
face
the
thought
of
going
before
an
audience
again
and
especially
in
such
circumstances
there
were
to
be
gayety
and
life
and
light
and
sparkle
all
about
me
there
were
to
be
lassies
in
their
gay
dresses
and
the
merriest
music
in
london
and
my
part
was
to
be
merry
too
and
to
make
the
great
audience
laugh
that
i
would
see
beyond
the
footlights
and
i
thought
of
the
merryman
in
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
and
that
i
must
be
a
little
like
him
though
my
cause
for
grief
was
different
but
i
had
given
my
word
and
though
i
longed
again
and
again
as
i
rode
toward
london
and
as
the
time
drew
near
for
my
performance
to
back
out
there
was
no
way
that
i
could
do
so
and
tom
valiance
did
his
best
to
cheer
me
and
hearten
me
and
relieve
my
nervousness
i
have
never
been
so
nervous
before
not
since
i
made
my
first
appearance
before
an
audience
have
i
been
so
near
to
stage
fright
i
would
not
see
anyone
that
night
when
i
reached
the
theatre
i
stayed
in
my
and
tom
valiance
stayed
with
me
and
kept
everyone
who
tried
to
speak
with
me
away
there
were
good
folk
and
kindly
folk
friends
of
mine
in
the
company
who
wanted
to
shake
my
hand
and
tell
me
how
they
felt
for
me
but
he
knew
that
it
was
better
for
them
not
to
see
me
yet
and
he
was
my
bodyguard
it
no
use
tom
i
said
to
him
again
and
again
after
i
was
dressed
and
in
my
make
up
i
was
cold
first
and
then
hot
and
i
trembled
in
every
limb
they
have
to
ring
the
curtain
down
on
me
you
be
all
right
harry
he
said
so
soon
as
you
out
there
remember
they
all
your
friends
but
he
could
not
comfort
me
i
felt
sure
that
it
was
a
foolish
thing
for
me
to
try
to
do
that
i
could
not
go
through
with
it
and
i
was
sorry
for
the
thousandth
time
that
i
had
let
them
persuade
me
to
make
the
effort
a
call
boy
came
at
last
to
warn
me
that
it
was
nearly
time
for
my
first
entrance
i
went
with
tom
into
the
wings
and
stood
there
waiting
i
was
pale
under
my
make
up
and
i
was
shaking
and
trembling
like
a
baby
and
even
then
i
wanted
to
cry
off
but
i
remembered
my
boy
and
those
last
words
of
his
carry
on
i
must
not
fail
him
without
at
least
trying
to
do
what
he
would
have
wanted
me
to
do
my
entrance
was
with
a
lilting
little
song
called
i
love
my
jean
and
i
knew
that
in
a
moment
my
cue
would
be
given
and
i
would
hear
the
music
of
that
song
beginning
i
was
as
cold
as
if
i
had
been
in
an
icy
street
although
it
was
hot
i
thought
of
the
two
thousand
people
who
were
waiting
for
me
beyond
the
footlights
the
house
was
a
big
one
and
it
was
packed
full
that
night
i
ca
tom
i
ca
i
cried
but
he
only
smiled
and
gave
me
a
little
push
as
my
cue
came
and
the
music
began
i
could
scarcely
hear
it
it
was
like
music
a
great
distance
off
coming
very
faintly
to
my
ears
and
i
said
a
prayer
inside
i
asked
god
to
be
good
to
me
once
more
and
to
give
me
strength
and
to
bear
me
through
this
ordeal
that
i
was
facing
as
he
had
borne
me
through
before
and
then
i
had
to
step
into
the
full
glare
of
the
great
lights
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
the
people
were
unreal
stretching
away
from
me
in
long
sloping
rows
their
white
faces
staring
at
me
from
the
darkness
beyond
the
great
lights
and
there
was
a
little
ripple
that
ran
through
them
as
i
went
out
as
if
a
great
many
people
all
at
the
same
moment
had
caught
their
breath
i
stood
and
faced
them
and
the
music
sounded
in
my
ears
for
just
a
moment
they
were
still
and
then
they
were
shaken
by
a
mighty
roar
they
cheered
and
cheered
and
cheered
they
stood
up
and
waved
to
me
i
could
hear
their
voices
rising
and
cries
coming
to
me
with
my
own
name
among
them
bravo
harry
i
heard
them
call
and
then
there
were
more
cheers
and
a
great
clapping
of
hands
and
i
have
been
told
that
everywhere
in
that
great
audience
men
and
women
were
crying
and
that
the
tears
were
rolling
down
their
cheeks
without
ever
an
attempt
by
any
of
them
to
hide
them
or
to
check
them
it
was
the
most
wonderful
and
the
most
beautiful
demonstration
i
have
ever
seen
in
all
the
years
that
i
have
been
upon
the
stage
many
and
many
a
time
audiences
have
been
good
to
me
they
have
clapped
me
and
they
have
cheered
me
but
never
has
an
audience
treated
me
as
that
one
did
i
had
to
use
every
bit
of
strength
and
courage
that
i
had
to
keep
from
breaking
down
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
i
got
through
with
that
first
song
that
night
i
do
not
even
know
whether
i
really
sang
it
but
i
think
that
somehow
blindly
without
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
did
get
through
i
did
sing
it
to
the
end
habit
the
way
that
i
was
used
to
it
i
suppose
helped
me
to
carry
on
and
when
i
left
the
stage
the
whole
company
it
seemed
to
me
was
waiting
for
me
they
were
crying
and
laughing
hysterically
and
they
crowded
around
me
and
kissed
me
and
hugged
me
and
wrung
my
hand
it
seemed
that
the
worst
of
my
ordeal
was
over
but
in
the
last
act
i
had
to
face
another
test
there
was
a
song
for
me
in
that
last
act
that
was
the
great
song
in
london
that
season
i
have
sung
it
all
over
america
since
then
the
laddies
who
fought
and
won
it
has
been
successful
everywhere
that
song
has
been
one
of
the
most
popular
i
have
ever
sung
but
it
was
a
cruel
song
for
me
to
sing
that
night
it
was
the
climax
of
the
last
act
and
of
the
whole
piece
in
three
cheers
soldiers
were
brought
on
each
night
to
be
on
the
stage
behind
me
when
i
sang
that
song
they
were
from
the
battalion
of
the
scots
guards
in
london
and
they
were
real
soldiers
in
uniform
different
men
were
used
each
night
and
the
money
that
was
paid
to
the
tommies
for
their
work
went
into
the
company
fund
of
the
men
who
appeared
and
helped
to
provide
them
with
comforts
and
luxuries
and
the
war
office
was
glad
of
the
arrangement
too
for
it
was
a
great
song
to
stimulate
recruiting
there
were
two
lines
in
the
refrain
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
it
was
when
i
came
to
those
two
lines
that
night
that
i
did
indeed
break
down
here
they
are
when
we
all
gather
round
the
old
fireside
and
the
fond
mother
kisses
her
son
were
they
not
cruel
words
for
me
to
have
to
sing
who
knew
that
his
mother
could
never
kiss
my
son
again
they
brought
it
all
back
to
me
my
son
was
gone
he
would
never
come
back
with
the
laddies
who
had
fought
and
won
for
a
moment
i
could
not
go
on
i
was
choking
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
and
my
throat
was
choked
with
sobs
but
the
music
went
on
and
the
chorus
took
up
the
song
and
between
the
singers
and
the
orchestra
they
covered
the
break
my
emotion
had
made
and
in
a
little
space
i
was
able
to
go
on
with
the
next
verse
and
to
carry
on
until
my
part
in
the
show
was
done
for
the
night
but
i
still
wondered
how
it
was
that
they
had
not
had
to
ring
down
the
curtain
upon
me
and
that
tom
valiance
and
the
others
had
been
right
and
i
the
one
that
was
wrong
ah
weel
i
learned
that
night
what
many
and
many
another
briton
had
learned
both
at
home
and
in
france
that
you
can
never
know
what
you
can
do
until
you
have
to
find
it
out
yon
was
the
hardest
task
ever
i
had
to
undertake
but
for
my
boy
sake
and
because
they
had
made
me
understand
that
it
was
what
he
would
have
wanted
me
to
do
i
got
through
with
it
they
rose
to
me
again
and
cheered
and
cheered
after
i
had
finished
singing
the
laddies
who
fought
and
won
and
there
were
those
who
called
to
me
for
a
speech
but
so
much
i
had
to
deny
them
good
though
they
had
been
to
me
and
much
as
i
loved
them
for
the
way
they
had
received
me
i
had
no
words
that
night
to
thank
them
and
i
could
not
have
spoken
from
that
stage
had
my
life
depended
upon
it
i
could
only
get
through
after
my
poor
fashion
with
my
part
in
the
show
but
the
next
night
i
did
pull
myself
together
and
i
was
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
audience
thanks
that
were
simply
and
badly
put
it
may
be
but
that
came
from
the
bottom
of
my
overflowing
heart
chapter
x
i
had
not
believed
it
possible
but
there
i
was
not
only
back
at
work
back
upon
the
stage
to
which
i
thought
i
had
said
forever
but
successful
as
i
had
thought
i
could
never
be
again
and
so
i
decided
that
i
would
remain
until
the
engagement
of
three
cheers
closed
but
my
mind
was
made
up
to
retire
after
that
engagement
i
felt
that
i
had
done
all
i
could
and
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
retire
and
to
cease
trying
to
make
others
laugh
there
was
no
laughter
in
my
heart
and
often
and
often
that
season
as
i
cracked
my
merriest
jokes
my
heart
was
sore
and
heavy
and
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
but
slowly
a
new
sort
of
courage
came
to
me
i
was
able
to
meet
my
friends
again
and
to
talk
to
them
of
myself
and
of
my
boy
i
met
brother
officers
of
his
and
i
heard
tales
of
him
that
gave
me
a
new
and
even
greater
pride
in
him
than
i
had
known
before
and
my
friends
begged
me
to
carry
on
in
every
way
you
were
doing
a
great
work
and
a
good
work
harry
they
said
the
boy
would
want
you
to
carry
on
do
not
drop
all
the
good
you
were
doing
i
knew
that
they
were
right
to
sit
alone
and
give
way
to
my
grief
was
a
selfish
thing
to
do
at
such
a
time
if
there
was
work
for
me
to
do
still
it
was
my
duty
to
try
to
do
it
no
matter
how
greatly
i
would
have
preferred
to
rest
quiet
at
this
time
there
was
great
need
of
making
the
people
of
britain
understand
the
need
of
food
conservation
and
so
i
began
to
go
about
london
making
speeches
on
that
subject
wherever
people
could
be
gathered
together
to
listen
to
me
they
told
me
i
did
some
good
and
at
least
i
tried
and
before
long
i
was
glad
indeed
that
i
had
listened
to
the
counsel
of
my
friends
and
had
not
given
way
to
my
selfish
desire
to
nurse
my
grief
in
solitude
and
silence
for
i
realized
that
there
was
a
real
work
for
me
to
do
those
folk
who
had
begged
me
to
do
my
part
in
lightening
the
gloom
of
britain
had
been
right
there
was
so
much
sorrow
and
grief
in
the
land
that
it
was
the
duty
of
all
who
could
dispel
it
if
even
for
a
little
space
to
do
what
they
could
i
remembered
that
poem
of
ella
wheeler
wilcox
laugh
and
the
world
laughs
with
you
and
so
i
tried
to
laugh
and
to
make
the
part
of
the
world
that
i
chanced
to
be
in
laugh
with
me
for
i
knew
there
was
weeping
and
sorrowing
enough
and
all
the
time
i
felt
that
the
spirit
of
my
boy
was
with
me
and
that
he
knew
what
i
was
doing
and
why
and
was
glad
and
that
he
understood
that
if
i
laughed
it
was
not
because
i
thought
less
often
of
him
or
missed
him
less
keenly
and
bitterly
than
i
had
done
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
much
praise
for
my
work
from
high
officials
and
it
made
me
proud
and
glad
to
know
that
the
men
who
were
at
the
head
of
effort
in
the
war
thought
i
was
being
of
use
one
time
i
spoke
with
balfour
the
former
prime
minister
at
drury
lane
theatre
to
one
of
the
greatest
war
gatherings
that
was
ever
held
in
london
and
always
and
everywhere
there
were
the
hospitals
full
of
the
laddies
who
had
been
brought
home
from
france
ah
but
they
were
pitiful
those
laddies
who
had
fought
and
won
and
been
brought
back
to
be
nursed
back
to
the
life
they
had
been
so
bravely
willing
to
lay
down
for
their
country
but
it
was
hard
to
look
at
them
and
know
how
they
were
suffering
and
to
go
through
with
the
task
i
had
set
myself
of
cheering
them
and
comforting
them
in
my
own
way
there
were
times
when
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
through
with
my
program
they
never
complained
they
were
always
bright
and
cheerful
no
matter
how
terrible
their
wounds
might
be
no
matter
what
sacrifices
they
had
made
of
eyes
and
limbs
there
were
men
in
those
hospitals
who
knew
that
they
were
going
out
no
more
than
half
the
men
they
had
been
and
yet
they
were
as
brave
and
careless
of
themselves
as
if
their
wounds
had
been
but
trifles
i
think
the
greatest
exhibition
of
courage
and
nerve
the
world
has
ever
seen
was
to
be
found
in
those
hospitals
in
london
and
indeed
all
over
britain
where
those
wonderful
lads
kept
up
their
spirits
always
though
they
knew
they
could
never
again
be
sound
in
body
many
and
many
of
them
there
were
who
knew
that
they
could
never
walk
again
the
shady
lanes
of
their
hameland
or
the
little
streets
of
their
hame
towns
many
and
many
more
there
were
who
knew
that
even
after
the
bandages
were
taken
from
about
their
eyes
they
would
never
gaze
again
upon
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
flowers
growing
upon
their
native
hillsides
that
never
again
could
they
look
upon
the
faces
of
their
loved
ones
they
knew
that
everlasting
darkness
was
their
portion
upon
this
earth
but
one
and
all
they
talked
and
laughed
and
sang
and
it
was
there
among
the
hospitals
that
i
came
to
find
true
courage
and
good
cheer
it
was
not
there
that
i
found
talk
of
discouragement
and
longing
for
any
early
peace
even
though
the
final
victory
that
could
alone
bring
a
real
peace
and
a
worthy
peace
had
not
been
won
no
not
in
the
hospitals
could
i
find
and
hear
such
talk
as
that
for
that
i
had
to
listen
to
those
who
had
not
gone
who
had
not
had
the
courage
and
the
nerve
to
offer
all
they
had
and
all
they
were
and
go
through
that
hell
of
hells
that
is
modern
war
i
saw
other
hospitals
besides
the
ones
in
london
after
a
time
when
i
was
very
tired
and
far
from
well
i
went
to
scotland
for
a
space
to
build
myself
up
and
get
some
rest
and
in
the
far
north
i
went
fishing
on
the
river
dee
which
runs
through
the
durrie
estate
and
while
i
was
there
the
laird
heard
of
it
and
he
sent
word
to
tell
me
of
a
tiny
hospital
hard
by
where
a
guid
lady
named
baird
was
helping
to
nurse
disabled
men
back
to
health
and
strength
he
asked
me
would
i
no
call
upon
the
men
and
try
to
give
them
a
little
cheer
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
of
the
chance
to
help
i
laid
down
my
rod
forthwith
for
here
was
better
work
than
fishing
and
in
my
ain
country
they
told
me
the
way
that
i
should
go
and
that
this
baird
had
turned
a
little
school
house
into
a
convalescent
home
and
was
doing
a
fine
and
wonderful
work
for
the
laddies
she
had
taken
in
so
i
set
out
to
find
it
and
i
walked
along
a
country
road
to
come
to
it
soon
i
saw
a
man
strong
and
hale
as
it
seemed
pushing
a
wheel
chair
along
the
road
toward
me
and
in
the
chair
sat
a
man
and
i
could
see
at
once
that
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
legs
that
he
was
paralyzed
from
the
waist
down
it
was
the
way
he
called
to
him
who
was
pushing
him
that
made
me
tak
notice
go
to
the
right
mon
he
would
call
or
a
moment
later
to
the
left
now
and
then
they
came
near
to
the
disaster
the
one
who
was
pushing
was
heading
straight
for
the
side
of
the
road
and
the
one
in
the
chair
bellowed
out
to
him
whoa
there
he
called
mon
ye
taking
me
into
the
ditch
where
would
ye
be
going
with
me
anyway
and
then
i
understood
the
man
who
was
pushing
was
blind
they
had
but
the
one
pair
of
eyes
and
the
one
pair
of
legs
between
the
two
of
them
and
it
was
so
that
they
contrived
to
go
out
together
without
taking
help
from
anyone
else
and
they
were
both
as
cheerful
as
wee
laddies
out
for
a
lark
it
was
great
sport
for
them
and
it
was
they
who
gave
me
my
directions
to
get
to
baird
they
disputed
a
little
about
the
way
the
blind
man
puir
laddie
thought
he
knew
and
he
did
not
not
quite
but
he
corrected
the
man
who
could
see
but
could
not
walk
it
the
wrong
road
you
giving
the
gentleman
he
said
it
the
second
turn
he
should
be
taking
not
the
first
and
the
other
would
not
argue
with
him
it
was
a
kindly
thing
the
way
he
kept
quiet
and
did
but
wink
at
me
that
i
might
know
the
truth
he
trusted
me
to
understand
and
to
know
why
he
was
acting
as
he
was
and
i
blessed
him
in
my
heart
for
his
thoughtfulness
and
so
i
thanked
them
and
passed
on
and
reached
baird
and
found
a
royal
welcome
there
and
when
they
asked
me
if
i
would
sing
for
the
soldiers
and
i
said
it
was
for
that
that
i
had
come
there
were
tears
in
baird
eyes
and
so
i
gave
a
wee
concert
there
and
sang
my
songs
and
did
my
best
to
cheer
up
those
boys
ah
my
puir
brave
scotland
my
bonnie
little
scotland
no
part
of
all
the
united
kingdom
and
for
that
matter
no
part
of
the
world
has
played
a
greater
part
in
proportion
to
its
size
and
its
ability
than
has
scotland
in
this
war
for
humanity
against
the
black
force
that
has
attacked
it
nearly
a
million
men
has
scotland
sent
to
the
army
out
of
a
total
population
of
five
million
one
in
five
of
all
her
people
have
gone
no
country
in
the
world
has
ever
matched
that
record
ah
there
were
no
slackers
in
scotland
and
they
are
still
going
they
are
still
going
as
fast
as
they
are
old
enough
as
fast
as
restrictions
are
removed
so
that
men
are
taken
who
were
turned
back
at
first
by
the
recruiting
officers
as
fast
as
men
see
to
it
that
some
provision
is
made
for
those
they
must
leave
behind
them
they
are
putting
on
the
king
uniform
and
going
out
against
the
hun
my
country
my
ain
scotland
is
not
great
in
area
it
is
not
a
rich
country
in
worldly
goods
or
money
but
it
is
big
with
a
bigness
beyond
measurement
it
is
rich
beyond
the
wildest
dreams
of
avarice
in
patriotism
in
love
of
country
and
in
bravery
we
have
few
young
men
left
in
scotland
it
is
rarely
indeed
that
in
a
scottish
village
in
a
glen
even
in
a
city
you
see
a
young
man
in
these
days
only
the
very
old
are
left
and
the
men
of
middle
age
and
you
know
why
the
young
men
you
see
are
there
they
can
not
go
because
although
their
spirit
is
willing
their
flesh
is
too
weak
to
let
them
go
for
one
reason
or
another
factory
and
field
and
forge
all
have
been
stripped
to
fill
the
scottish
regiments
and
keep
them
at
their
full
strength
and
in
scotland
as
in
england
women
have
stepped
in
to
fill
the
places
their
men
have
left
vacant
this
war
is
not
to
be
fought
by
men
alone
women
have
their
part
to
play
and
they
are
playing
it
nobly
day
after
day
the
women
of
scotland
have
seen
their
duty
they
have
heard
their
country
call
and
they
have
answered
it
you
will
find
it
hard
to
discover
anyone
in
domestic
service
in
scotland
the
folk
who
used
to
keep
servants
sent
them
packing
long
since
to
work
where
they
would
be
of
more
use
to
their
country
the
women
of
each
household
are
doing
the
work
about
the
house
little
though
they
may
have
been
accustomed
to
such
tasks
in
the
days
of
peace
and
they
glory
and
take
pride
in
the
knowledge
that
they
are
helping
to
fill
a
place
in
the
munitions
factories

in

her
ancient
business
of
war
and
she
is
carrying
it
on
in
the
most
businesslike
way
sternly
and
relentlessly
but
that
is
true
all
over
the
united
kingdom
i
do
not
claim
that
scotland
takes
the
war
more
seriously
than
the
rest
of
britain
but
i
do
think
that
she
has
set
an
example
by
the
way
she
has
flung
herself
tooth
and
nail
into
the
mighty
task
that
confronts
us
all
all
of
us
allies
who
are
leagued
against
the
hun
and
his
plan
to
conquer
the
world
and
make
it
bow
its
neck
in
submission
under
his
iron
heel
let
me
tell
you
how
scotland
takes
this
war
let
me
show
you
the
homecoming
of
a
scottish
soldier
back
from
the
trenches
on
leave
why
he
is
received
with
no
more
ceremony
than
if
he
were
coming
home
from
his
day
work
donald
or
jock
might
be
his
name
or
andy
steps
from
the
train
at
his
old
hame
town
he
is
fresh
from
the
mud
of
the
flanders
trenches
and
all
his
possessions
and
his
kit
are
on
his
back
so
that
he
is
more
like
a
beast
of
burden
than
the
natty
creature
old
tradition
taught
us
to
think
a
soldier
must
always
be
on
his
boots
there
are
still
dried
blobs
of
mud
from
some
hole
in
france
that
is
like
a
crater
in
hell
his
uniform
will
be
pretty
sure
to
be
dirty
too
and
torn
and
perhaps
if
you
looked
closely
at
it
you
would
see
stains
upon
it
that
you
might
not
be
far
wrong
in
guessing
to
be
blood
leave
long
enough
to
let
him
come
home
to
scotland
a
long
road
it
is
from
france
to
scotland
these
days
has
been
a
rare
thing
for
jock
he
will
have
been
campaigning
a
long
time
to
earn
it
months
certainly
and
maybe
even
years
perhaps
he
was
one
of
these
who
went
out
first
he
may
have
been
mentioned
in
dispatches
there
may
be
a
distinguished
conduct
medal
hidden
about
him
somewhere
worth
all
the
iron
crosses
the
kaiser
ever
gave
he
has
seen
many
a
bloody
field
be
sure
of
that
he
has
heard
the
sounding
of
the
gas
alarm
and
maybe
got
a
whiff
of
the
dirty
poison
gas
the
huns
turned
loose
against
our
boys
he
has
looked
death
in
the
face
so
often
that
he
has
grown
used
to
him
but
now
he
is
back
in
scotland
safe
and
sound
free
from
battle
and
the
work
of
the
trenches
for
a
space
home
to
gain
new
strength
for
his
next
bout
with
fritz
across
the
water
when
he
gets
off
the
train
jock
looks
about
him
from
force
of
habit
but
no
one
has
come
to
the
station
to
meet
him
and
he
looks
as
if
that
gave
him
neither
surprise
nor
concern
for
a
minute
perhaps
he
will
look
around
him
wondering
i
think
that
things
are
so
much
as
they
were
fixing
in
his
mind
the
old
familiar
scenes
that
have
brought
him
cheer
so
often
in
black
deadly
nights
in
the
trenches
or
in
lonely
billets
out
there
in
france
and
then
quietly
and
as
if
he
were
indeed
just
home
from
some
short
trip
he
shifts
his
pack
so
that
it
lies
comfortably
across
his
back
and
trudges
off
there
would
be
cabs
around
the
station
but
it
would
not
come
into
mind
to
hail
one
of
the
drivers
he
has
been
used
to
using
mare
in
france
when
he
wanted
to
go
anywhere
and
so
now
he
sets
off
quietly
with
his
long
swinging
soldier
stride
as
he
walks
along
he
is
among
scenes
familiar
to
him
since
his
boyhood
you
house
you
barn
yon
wooded
rise
against
the
sky
are
landmarks
for
him
and
he
is
pretty
sure
to
meet
old
friends
they
nod
to
him
pleasantly
and
with
a
smile
but
there
is
no
excitement
no
strangeness
in
their
greeting
for
all
the
emotion
they
show
these
folk
to
whom
he
has
come
back
as
from
the
grave
they
might
have
seen
him
yesterday
and
the
day
before
that
and
the
war
never
have
been
at
all
and
jock
thinks
nothing
of
it
that
they
are
not
more
excited
about
him
you
and
i
may
be
thinking
of
jock
as
a
hero
but
that
is
not
his
idea
about
himself
he
is
just
a
tommy
home
on
leave
from
france
one
of
a
hundred
thousand
maybe
and
if
he
thought
at
all
about
the
way
his
home
folk
greeted
him
it
would
be
just
so
that
he
could
not
expect
them
to
be
making
a
fuss
about
one
soldier
out
of
so
many
and
since
he
jock
is
not
much
excited
not
much
worked
up
because
he
is
seeing
these
good
folk
again
he
does
not
think
it
strange
that
they
are
not
more
excited
about
the
sight
of
him
it
would
be
if
they
did
make
a
fuss
over
him
and
welcome
him
loudly
that
he
would
think
it
strange
and
at
last
he
comes
to
his
own
old
home
he
will
stop
and
look
around
a
bit
maybe
he
has
seen
that
old
house
a
thousand
times
out
there
tried
to
remember
every
line
and
corner
of
it
and
maybe
as
he
looks
down
the
quiet
village
street
he
is
thinking
of
how
different
france
was
and
deep
down
in
his
heart
jock
is
glad
that
everything
is
as
it
was
and
that
nothing
has
been
changed
he
could
not
tell
you
why
he
could
not
put
his
feeling
into
words
but
it
is
there
deep
down
and
the
truer
and
the
keener
because
it
is
so
deep
ah
jock
may
take
it
quietly
and
there
may
be
no
way
for
him
to
show
his
heart
but
he
is
glad
to
be
home
and
at
his
gate
will
come
as
a
rule
jock
first
real
greeting
a
dog
grown
old
since
his
departure
will
come
out
wagging
his
tail
and
licking
the
soldier
hand
and
jock
will
lean
down
and
give
his
old
dog
a
pat
if
the
dog
had
not
come
he
would
have
been
surprised
and
disappointed
and
so
glad
with
every
fibre
of
his
being
jock
goes
in
and
finds
father
and
mother
and
sisters
within
they
look
up
at
his
coming
and
their
happiness
shines
for
a
moment
in
their
eyes
but
they
are
not
the
sort
of
people
to
show
their
emotions
or
make
a
fuss
mother
and
girls
will
rise
and
kiss
him
and
begin
to
take
his
gear
and
his
father
will
shake
him
by
the
hand
well
the
father
will
ask
how
are
you
getting
along
lad
and
all
right
he
will
answer
that
is
the
british
answer
to
that
question
always
and
everywhere
then
he
sits
down
happy
and
at
rest
and
lights
his
pipe
maybe
and
looks
about
the
old
room
which
holds
so
many
memories
for
him
and
supper
will
be
ready
you
may
be
sure
they
will
not
have
much
to
say
these
folk
of
jock
but
if
you
look
at
his
face
as
dish
after
dish
is
set
before
him
you
will
understand
that
this
is
a
feast
that
has
been
prepared
for
him
they
may
have
been
going
without
all
sorts
of
good
things
themselves
but
they
have
contrived
in
some
fashion
to
have
them
all
for
jock
all
scotland
has
tightened
its
belt
and
done
its
part
in
that
fashion
as
in
every
other
toward
the
winning
of
the
war
but
for
the
soldiers
the
best
is
none
too
good
and
jock
folk
would
rather
make
him
welcome
so
by
proof
that
takes
no
words
than
by
demonstrations
of
delight
and
of
affection
as
he
eats
they
gather
round
him
at
the
board
and
they
tell
him
all
the
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
he
does
not
talk
about
the
war
and
if
they
are
curious
probably
they
are
not
they
do
not
ask
him
questions
they
think
that
he
wants
to
forget
about
the
war
and
the
trenches
and
the
mud
and
they
are
right
and
so
after
he
has
eaten
his
fill
he
lights
his
pipe
again
and
sits
about
and
maybe
as
it
grows
dark
he
takes
a
bit
walk
into
town
he
walks
slowly
as
if
he
is
glad
that
for
once
he
need
not
be
in
a
hurry
and
he
stops
to
look
into
shop
windows
as
if
he
had
never
seen
their
stocks
before
though
you
may
be
sure
that
in
a
scottish
village
he
has
seen
everything
they
have
to
offer
hundreds
of
times
he
will
meet
friends
maybe
and
they
will
stop
and
nod
to
him
and
perhaps
one
of
six
will
stop
longer
how
are
you
getting
on
jock
will
be
the
question
all
right
jock
will
say
and
he
will
think
the
question
rather
fatuous
maybe
if
he
were
not
all
right
how
should
he
be
there
but
if
jock
had
lost
both
legs
or
an
arm
or
if
he
had
been
blinded
that
would
still
be
his
answer
those
words
have
become
a
sort
of
slogan
for
the
british
army
that
typify
its
spirit
jock
walk
is
soon
over
and
he
goes
home
by
an
old
path
that
is
known
to
him
every
foot
of
it
and
goes
to
bed
in
his
own
old
bed
he
has
not
broken
into
the
routine
of
the
household
and
he
sees
no
reason
why
he
should
and
the
next
day
it
is
much
the
same
for
him
he
gets
up
as
early
as
he
ever
did
and
he
is
likely
to
do
a
few
odd
bits
of
work
that
his
father
has
not
had
time
to
come
to
he
talks
with
his
mother
and
the
girls
of
all
sorts
of
little
commonplace
things
and
with
his
father
he
discusses
the
affairs
of
the
community
and
in
the
evening
he
strolls
down
town
again
and
exchanges
a
few
words
with
friends
and
learns
perhaps
of
boys
who
have
been
lucky
enough
to
get
home
on
leave
of
boys
with
whom
he
grew
up
who
have
gone
west
so
it
goes
on
for
several
days
each
day
the
same
jock
is
quietly
happy
it
is
no
task
to
entertain
him
he
does
not
want
to
be
entertained
the
peace
and
quiet
of
home
are
enough
for
him
they
are
change
enough
from
the
turmoil
of
the
front
and
the
ceaseless
grind
of
the
life
in
the
army
in
france
and
then
jock
leave
nears
its
end
and
it
is
time
for
him
to
go
back
he
tells
them
and
he
makes
his
few
small
preparations
they
will
have
cleaned
his
kit
for
him
and
mended
some
of
his
things
that
needed
mending
and
when
it
is
time
for
him
to
go
they
help
him
on
with
his
pack
and
he
kisses
his
mother
and
the
girls
and
shakes
hands
with
his
father
well
jock
says
he
might
be
going
to
work
in
a
factory
a
few
miles
off
i
be
all
right
now
do
you
cry
now
mother
and
you
jeannie
and
maggie
do
you
fash
yourselves
about
me
i
be
back
again
and
if
i
should
come
back
why
i
be
all
right
so
he
goes
and
they
stand
looking
after
him
and
his
old
dog
wonders
why
he
is
going
and
where
and
makes
a
move
to
follow
him
maybe
but
he
marches
off
down
the
street
alone
never
looking
back
and
is
waiting
when
the
train
comes
it
will
be
full
of
other
jocks
and
andrews
and
tams
on
their
way
back
to
france
like
him
and
he
will
nod
to
some
he
knows
as
he
settles
down
in
the
carriage
and
in
just
two
days
jock
will
have
traveled
the
length
of
england
and
crossed
the
channel
and
ridden
up
to
the
front
he
will
have
reported
himself
and
have
been
ordered
with
his
company
into
the
trenches
and
on
the
third
night
had
you
followed
him
you
might
see
him
peering
over
the
parapet
at
the
lines
of
the
hun
across
no
land
and
listening
to
the
whine
of
bullets
and
the
shriek
of
shells
over
his
head
with
a
star
shell
maybe
to
throw
a
green
light
upon
him
for
a
moment
so
it
is
that
a
warrior
comes
and
that
a
warrior
goes
in
a
land
where
war
is
war
in
a
land
where
war
has
become
the
business
of
all
every
day
and
has
settled
down
into
a
matter
of
routine
chapter
xi
i
could
not
much
as
i
should
in
many
ways
have
liked
to
do
so
prolong
my
stay
in
scotland
the
peace
and
the
restfulness
of
the
highlands
the
charm
of
the
heather
and
the
hills
the
long
lazy
days
with
my
rod
whipping
some
favorite
stream
ah
they
made
me
happy
for
a
moment
but
they
could
not
make
me
forget
my
duty
called
me
back
and
the
thought
of
war
and
suffering
and
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
me
that
nothing
could
keep
me
from
plunging
again
into
the
work
i
had
set
out
to
do
in
those
days
i
was
far
too
restless
to
be
taking
my
ease
at
home
in
my
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
a
thousand
activities
called
me
the
rest
had
been
necessary
i
had
had
to
admit
that
and
to
obey
my
doctor
for
i
had
been
feeling
the
strain
of
my
long
continued
activity
piled
up
as
it
was
on
top
of
my
grief
and
care
and
yet
i
was
eager
to
be
off
and
about
my
work
again
i
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
same
work
i
had
been
doing
no
i
was
still
a
young
man
i
was
younger
than
men
and
officers
who
were
taking
their
turn
in
the
trenches
i
was
but
years
old
and
there
was
a
lot
of
life
and
snap
in
the
old
dog
yet
my
life
had
been
rightly
lived
as
a
young
man
i
had
worked
in
a
pit
ye
ken
and
that
had
given
me
a
strength
in
my
back
and
my
legs
that
would
have
served
me
well
in
the
trenches
war
these
days
means
hard
work
as
well
as
fighting
more
indeed
war
is
a
business
a
great
industry
now
there
is
all
manner
of
work
that
must
be
done
at
the
front
and
right
behind
it
aye
and
i
was
eager
to
be
there
and
to
be
doing
my
share
of
it
and
not
for
the
first
time
many
a
time
and
often
i
had
broached
my
idea
of
being
allowed
to
enlist
before
the
huns
killed
my
boy
but
they
would
no
listen
to
me
they
told
me
each
time
that
there
was
more
and
better
work
for
me
to
do
at
hame
in
britain
spurring
others
on
cheering
them
when
they
came
back
maimed
and
broken
getting
the
country
to
put
its
shoulder
to
the
wheel
when
it
came
to
subscribing
to
the
war
loans
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
not
for
me
to
decide
that
i
must
obey
those
who
were
better
in
a
position
to
judge
than
i
could
be
i
went
down
south
to
england
and
i
talked
again
of
enlisting
and
trying
to
get
a
crack
at
those
who
had
killed
my
boy
and
again
my
friends
refused
to
listen
to
me
why
harry
they
said
to
me
and
not
my
own
friends
only
but
men
highly
placed
enough
to
make
me
know
that
i
must
pay
heed
to
what
they
said
you
must
not
think
of
it
if
you
enlisted
or
if
we
got
you
a
commission
you
be
but
one
man
out
there
here
you
worth
many
men
a
brigade
or
a
division
maybe
you
are
more
use
to
us
than
many
men
who
go
out
there
to
fight
you
do
great
things
toward
winning
the
war
every
day
no
harry
there
is
work
for
every
man
in
britain
to
do
and
you
have
found
yours
and
are
doing
it
i
was
not
content
though
even
when
i
seemed
to
agree
with
them
i
did
try
to
argue
but
it
was
no
use
and
still
i
felt
that
it
was
no
time
for
a
man
to
be
playing
and
to
be
giving
so
much
of
his
time
to
making
others
gay
it
was
well
for
folk
to
laugh
and
to
get
their
minds
off
the
horror
of
war
for
a
little
time
well
i
knew
aye
and
i
believed
that
i
was
doing
good
some
good
at
least
and
giving
cheer
to
some
puir
laddies
who
needed
it
sorely
but
weel
it
was
no
what
i
wanted
to
be
doing
when
my
country
was
fighting
for
her
life
i
made
up
my
mind
slowly
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
to
do
that
would
fit
in
with
the
ideas
and
wishes
of
those
whose
word
i
was
bound
to
heed
and
that
would
still
come
closer
than
what
i
was
doing
to
meet
my
own
desires
every
day
nearly
then
i
was
getting
letters
from
the
front
they
came
from
laddies
whom
i
helped
to
make
up
their
minds
that
they
belonged
over
yon
where
the
men
were
some
were
from
boys
who
came
from
aboot
dunoon
i
known
those
laddies
since
they
were
bits
bairns
most
of
them
and
then
there
were
letters
and
they
touched
me
as
much
and
came
as
close
home
as
any
of
them
from
boys
who
were
utter
strangers
to
me
but
who
told
me
they
felt
they
knew
me
because
they
seen
me
on
the
stage
or
because
their
phonograph
maybe
played
some
of
my
records
and
because
they
read
that
my
boy
had
shared
their
dangers
and
given
his
life
as
they
were
ready
one
and
all
to
do
and
those
letters
nearly
all
had
the
same
refrain
they
wanted
me
they
wanted
me
to
come
to
them
since
they
could
be
coming
to
me
come
on
out
here
and
see
us
and
sing
for
us
harry
they
write
to
me
it
be
a
fair
treat
to
see
your
mug
and
hear
you
singing
about
the
wee
hoose
amang
the
heather
or
the
bonnie
bonnie
lassie
how
could
a
man
get
such
a
plea
as
that
and
not
want
to
do
what
those
laddies
asked
how
could
he
think
of
the
great
deal
they
were
doing
and
not
want
to
do
the
little
bit
they
asked
of
him
but
it
was
no
a
simple
matter
ye
ken
i
could
not
pack
a
bag
and
start
for
france
from
charing
cross
or
victoria
as
i
might
have
done
and
often
did
before
the
war
no
one
might
go
to
france
unless
he
had
passports
and
leave
from
the
war
office
and
many
another
sort
of
arrangement
there
was
to
make
but
i
set
wheels
in
motion
just
to
go
to
france
to
sing
for
the
boys
would
have
been
easy
enough
they
told
me
that
at
once
what
harry
lauder
wants
to
go
to
france
to
sing
for
the
soldiers
he
shall
whenever
he
pleases
tell
him
we
be
glad
to
send
him
so
said
the
war
office
but
i
knew
what
they
meant
they
meant
for
me
to
go
to
one
or
more
of
the
british
bases
and
give
concerts
there
were
troops
moving
in
and
out
of
the
bases
all
the
time
men
been
in
the
trenches
or
in
action
in
an
offensive
and
were
back
in
rest
billets
or
even
further
back
were
there
in
their
thousands
but
it
was
the
real
front
i
was
eager
to
reach
i
wanted
to
be
where
my
boy
had
been
and
to
see
his
grave
i
wanted
to
sing
for
the
laddies
who
were
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
big
job
over
there
while
they
were
bearing
it
and
that
no
one
had
done
many
of
our
leading
actors
and
singers
and
other
entertainers
were
going
back
and
forth
to
france
all
the
time
never
a
week
went
by
but
they
were
helping
to
cheer
up
the
boys
at
the
bases
it
was
a
grand
work
they
were
doing
and
the
boys
were
grateful
to
them
and
all
britain
should
share
that
gratitude
but
it
was
a
wee
bit
more
that
i
wanted
to
be
doing
and
there
was
the
rub
i
wanted
to
go
up
to
the
battle
lines
themselves
and
to
sing
for
the
boys
who
were
in
the
thick
of
the
struggle
with
the
hun
i
wanted
to
give
a
concert
in
a
trench
where
the
huns
could
hear
me
if
they
cared
to
listen
i
wanted
them
to
learn
once
more
the
lesson
we
could
never
teach
them
often
enough
the
lesson
of
the
spirit
of
the
british
army
that
could
go
into
battle
with
a
laugh
on
its
lips
but
at
first
i
got
no
encouragement
at
all
when
i
told
what
it
was
in
my
mind
to
do
my
friends
who
had
influence
shook
their
heads
i
afraid
it
ca
be
managed
harry
they
told
me
it
never
been
done
i
told
them
what
i
believed
myself
and
what
i
have
often
thought
of
when
things
looked
hard
and
prospects
were
dark
i
told
them
everything
had
to
be
done
for
the
first
time
sometime
and
i
begged
them
not
to
give
up
the
effort
to
win
my
way
for
me
and
so
i
knew
that
when
they
told
me
no
one
had
done
it
before
it
was
reason
enough
why
i
should
do
it
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
be
the
pioneer
in
giving
concerts
under
fire
if
that
should
turn
out
to
be
a
part
of
the
contract
but
i
could
not
argue
i
could
only
say
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
to
do
and
wait
the
pleasure
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
decide
i
could
tell
the
military
authorities
where
they
must
send
me
it
was
for
me
to
obey
when
they
gave
their
orders
and
to
go
wherever
they
thought
i
would
do
the
most
good
i
would
not
have
you
thinking
that
i
was
naming
conditions
and
saying
i
would
go
where
i
pleased
or
bide
at
hame
that
was
not
my
way
all
i
could
do
was
to
hope
that
in
the
end
they
would
see
matters
as
i
did
and
so
decide
to
let
me
have
my
way
but
i
was
ready
for
my
orders
whatever
they
might
be
there
was
one
thing
i
wanted
above
all
others
to
do
when
i
got
to
france
and
so
much
i
said
i
wanted
to
meet
the
highland
brigade
and
see
the
bonnie
laddies
in
their
kilts
as
the
huns
saw
them
the
huns
who
called
them
the
ladies
from
hell
and
hated
them
worse
than
they
hated
any
troops
in
the
whole
british
army
ha
ye
heard
the
tale
of
the
scotsman
and
the
jew
sandy
and
ikey
they
were
and
they
were
having
a
disputatious
argument
together
each
said
he
could
name
more
great
men
of
his
race
who
were
famous
in
history
than
the
other
could
and
they
argued
and
nearly
came
to
blows
and
were
no
further
along
until
they
thought
of
making
a
bet
an
odd
bet
it
was
for
each
great
name
that
sandy
named
of
a
scot
whom
history
had
honored
he
was
to
pull
out
one
of
ikey
hairs
and
ikey
was
to
have
the
same
privilege
do
ye
begin
said
sandy
moses
said
they
and
pulled
bobbie
burns
cried
sandy
and
returned
the
compliment
abraham
said
ikey
and
pulled
again
ouch
duggie
haig
said
sandy
and
then
ikey
grabbed
a
handful
of
hairs
at
once
joseph
and
his
brethren
he
said
gloating
a
bit
as
he
watched
the
tears
starting
from
sandy
eyes
at
the
pain
of
losing
so
many
good
hairs
at
once
so
it
pulling
them
out
in
bunches
ye
are
said
sandy
ah
well
man
and
he
reached
with
both
his
hands
for
ikey
thatch
the
hieland
brigade
he
roared
and
pulled
all
the
hairs
his
two
hands
would
hold
ah
weel
there
are
sad
thoughts
that
come
to
me
as
well
as
proud
and
happy
ones
when
i
think
of
the
bonnie
kilted
laddies
who
fought
and
died
so
nobly
out
there
against
the
hun
they
were
my
own
laddies
those
and
it
was
with
them
and
amang
them
that
my
boy
went
to
his
death
it
was
amang
them
i
would
find
i
thought
those
who
could
tell
me
more
than
i
knew
of
how
he
had
died
and
of
how
he
had
lived
before
he
died
and
i
thought
the
boys
of
the
brigade
would
be
glad
to
see
me
and
to
hear
my
songs
songs
of
their
hames
and
their
ain
land
auld
scotland
and
so
i
used
what
influence
i
had
and
did
not
think
it
wrong
to
employ
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
cause
for
i
knew
that
if
they
sent
me
to
the
hieland
brigade
they
would
be
sending
me
to
the
front
of
the
front
line
for
that
was
where
i
would
have
to
go
seeking
the
hieland
laddies
i
waited
as
patiently
as
i
could
and
then
one
day
i
got
my
orders
i
was
delighted
for
the
thing
they
had
told
me
could
not
be
done
had
actually
been
arranged
for
me
i
was
asked
to
get
ready
to
go
to
france
to
entertain
the
soldiers
and
it
was
the
happiest
day
i
had
known
since
i
had
heard
of
my
boy
death
there
was
not
much
for
me
to
do
in
the
way
of
making
ready
the
whole
trip
of
course
would
be
a
military
one
i
might
be
setting
out
as
a
minstrel
for
france
but
every
detail
of
my
arrangements
had
to
be
made
in
accordance
with
military
rules
and
once
i
reached
france
i
would
be
under
the
orders
of
the
army
in
every
movement
i
might
make
all
that
was
carefully
explained
to
me
but
still
there
were
things
for
me
to
think
about
and
to
arrange
i
wanted
some
sort
of
accompaniment
for
my
songs
and
how
to
get
it
puzzled
me
for
a
time
but
there
was
a
firm
in
london
that
made
pianos
that
heard
of
my
coming
trip
and
solved
that
problem
for
me
they
built
and
they
presented
to
me
the
weest
piano
ever
you
saw
a
piano
so
wee
that
it
could
be
carried
in
an
ordinary
motor
car
only
five
octaves
it
had
but
it
was
big
enough
and
sma
enough
at
once
i
was
delighted
with
it
and
so
were
all
who
saw
it
it
weighed
only
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
less
than
even
a
middling
stout
man
and
it
was
cunningly
built
so
that
no
space
at
all
was
wasted
lauder
when
she
saw
it
called
it
cute
and
so
did
every
other
woman
who
laid
eyes
upon
it
it
was
designed
to
be
carried
on
the
grid
of
a
motor
car
and
so
it
was
for
many
miles
of
roads
when
i
was
sure
of
my
piano
i
thought
of
another
thing
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
take
with
me
and
so
i
spent
a
hundred
pounds
five
hundred
american
dollars
for
cigarettes
i
knew
they
would
be
welcome
everywhere
i
went
it
makes
no
matter
how
many
cigarettes
we
send
to
france
there
will
never
be
enough
my
friends
thought
i
was
making
a
mistake
in
taking
so
many
they
were
afraid
they
would
make
matters
hard
when
it
came
to
transportation
and
reminded
me
that
i
faced
difficulties
in
that
respect
in
france
it
was
nearly
impossible
for
us
at
home
in
britain
to
visualize
at
all
but
i
had
my
mind
and
my
heart
set
on
getting
those
fags
a
cigarette
is
a
fag
to
every
british
soldier
to
my
destination
with
me
indeed
i
thought
they
would
mean
more
to
the
laddies
out
there
than
i
could
hope
to
do
myself
i
was
not
to
travel
alone
my
tour
was
to
include
two
traveling
companions
of
distinction
and
fame
one
was
james
hogge
member
from
east
edinburgh
who
was
eager
as
so
many
members
of
parliament
were
to
see
for
himself
how
things
were
at
the
front
james
hogge
was
one
of
the
members
most
liked
by
the
soldiers
he
had
worked
hard
for
them
and
gained
and
well
earned
much
fame
by
the
way
he
struggled
with
the
matter
of
getting
the
right
sort
of
pensions
for
the
laddies
who
were
offering
their
lives
the
other
distinguished
companion
i
was
to
have
was
an
old
and
good
friend
of
mine
the
reverend
george
adam
then
a
secretary
to
the
minister
of
munitions
he
lived
in
ilford
a
suburb
of
london
then
but
is
now
in
montreal
canada
i
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
travel
with
both
these
men
for
i
knew
that
one
traveling
companions
on
such
a
tour
were
of
the
utmost
importance
in
determining
its
success
or
failure
and
i
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
pair
had
the
choice
been
left
to
me
which
of
course
it
was
not
there
we
were
you
see
the
reverend
george
adam
harry
lauder
and
james
hogge
and
no
sooner
did
the
soldiers
hear
of
the
combination
than
our
tour
was
named
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
was
what
we
were
called
and
that
absurd
name
stuck
to
us
through
our
whole
journey
in
france
up
and
down
the
battle
line
and
until
we
came
home
to
england
and
broke
up
chapter
xii
up
to
that
time
i
had
thought
i
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
war
i
had
had
much
news
from
my
boy
i
had
talked
i
think
to
as
many
returned
soldiers
as
any
man
in
britain
i
had
seen
much
of
the
backwash
and
the
wretched
aftermath
of
war
ah
yes
i
thought
i
knew
more
than
most
folk
did
of
what
war
meant
but
until
my
tour
began
as
i
see
now
easily
enough
i
knew
nothing
literally
nothing
at
all
there
are
towns
and
ports
in
britain
that
are
military
areas
one
may
not
enter
them
except
upon
business
the
urgency
of
which
has
been
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
military
authorities
one
must
have
a
permit
to
live
in
them
even
if
they
be
one
home
town
these
towns
are
vital
to
the
war
and
its
successful
prosecution
until
one
has
seen
a
british
port
of
embarkation
in
this
war
one
has
no
real
beginning
even
of
a
conception
of
the
task
the
war
has
imposed
upon
britain
it
was
so
with
me
i
know
and
since
then
other
men
have
told
me
the
same
thing
there
the
army
begins
to
pour
into
the
funnel
so
to
speak
that
leads
to
france
and
the
front
there
all
sorts
of
lines
are
brought
together
all
sorts
of
scattered
activities
come
to
a
focus
there
is
incessant
activity
day
and
night
it
was
from
folkestone
on
the
southeast
coast
that
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
was
to
embark
and
we
reached
folkestone
on
june
folkestone
in
time
of
peace
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
southern
watering
places
it
is
a
lovely
spot
great
hotels
line
the
leas
a
glorious
promenade
along
the
top
of
chalk
cliffs
that
looks
out
over
the
channel
in
the
distance
one
fancies
one
may
see
the
coast
of
france
beyond
the
blue
water
there
is
green
grass
everywhere
behind
the
beach
folkestone
has
a
miniature
harbor
that
in
time
of
peace
gave
shelter
to
the
fishing
fleet
and
to
the
channel
steamers
that
plied
to
and
from
boulogne
in
france
the
harbor
is
guarded
by
stone
jetties
it
has
been
greatly
enlarged
now
so
has
all
folkestone
for
that
matter
but
i
am
remembering
the
town
as
it
was
in
peace
there
was
no
pleasanter
and
kindlier
resort
along
that
coast
the
beach
was
wonderful
and
all
summer
long
it
attracted
bathers
and
children
at
play
bathing
machines
lined
the
beach
of
course
within
the
limits
of
the
town
those
queer
old
clumsy
looking
wagons
with
a
dressing
cabin
on
wheels
that
were
drawn
up
and
down
according
to
the
tide
so
that
bathers
might
enter
the
water
from
them
directly
there
as
in
most
british
towns
women
bathed
at
one
part
of
the
beach
men
at
the
other
and
all
in
the
most
decorous
and
modest
of
costumes
but
at
folkestone
in
the
old
days
of
peace
about
a
mile
from
the
town
limits
there
was
another
stretch
of
beach
where
all
the
gay
folk
bathed
men
and
women
together
and
there
the
costumes
were
such
as
might
be
seen
at
deauville
or
ostend
etretat
or
trouville
highly
they
scandalized
the
good
folk
of
folkestone
to
be
sure
but
little
was
said
and
nothing
was
done
for
after
all
those
were
the
folk
who
spent
the
money
they
dressed
in
white
tents
that
gleamed
against
the
sea
and
a
pretty
splash
of
color
they
made
on
a
bright
day
for
the
soberer
folk
to
go
and
watch
as
they
sat
on
the
low
chalk
cliffs
above
them
gone
gone
such
days
have
passed
for
folkestone
they
will
no
doubt
come
again
but
when
when
june
the
seventh
folkestone
should
have
been
gay
for
the
beginning
of
the
onset
of
summer
visitors
sea
bathing
should
just
have
been
beginning
to
be
attractive
as
the
sun
warmed
the
sea
and
the
beach
but
when
we
reached
the
town
war
was
over
all
men
in
uniform
were
everywhere
warships
lay
outside
the
harbor
khaki
and
guns
men
trudging
along
bearing
the
burdens
of
war
motor
trucks
rushing
ponderously
along
carrying
ammunition
and
food
messengers
on
motorcycles
sounding
to
all
traffic
that
might
be
in
the
way
the
clamorous
summons
to
clear
the
path
those
were
the
sights
we
saw
how
hopelessly
confused
it
all
seemed
i
could
not
believe
that
there
was
order
in
the
chaos
that
i
saw
but
that
was
because
the
key
to
all
that
bewildering
activity
was
not
in
my
possession
every
man
had
his
appointed
task
he
was
a
cog
in
the
greatest
machine
the
world
has
ever
seen
he
knew
just
what
he
was
to
do
and
how
much
time
had
been
allowed
for
the
performance
of
his
task
it
was
assumed
he
would
not
fail
the
british
army
makes
that
assumption
and
it
is
warranted
i
hear
praise
even
from
men
who
hate
the
hun
as
i
hate
him
for
the
superb
military
organization
of
the
german
army
they
say
the
kaiser
people
may
well
take
pride
in
that
but
i
say
that
i
am
prouder
of
what
britain
and
the
new
british
army
that
has
come
into
being
since
this
war
began
have
done
than
any
german
has
a
right
to
be
they
spent
years
in
making
ready
for
a
war
they
knew
they
meant
some
day
to
fight
we
had
not
had
that
day
that
i
first
saw
our
machine
really
functioning
as
many
months
for
preparation
as
they
had
had
years
and
yet
we
were
doing
our
part
we
had
had
to
build
and
prepare
while
we
helped
our
ally
france
to
hold
off
that
gray
horde
that
had
swept
down
so
treacherously
through
belgium
from
the
north
and
east
it
was
as
if
we
had
organized
and
trained
and
equipped
a
fire
brigade
while
the
fire
was
burning
and
while
our
first
devoted
fighters
sought
to
keep
it
in
check
with
water
buckets
and
they
did
they
did
the
water
buckets
served
while
the
hose
was
made
and
the
mains
were
laid
and
the
hydrants
set
in
place
and
the
trained
firemen
were
made
ready
to
take
up
the
task
and
now
that
i
had
come
to
folkestone
now
that
i
was
seeing
the
results
of
all
the
labor
that
had
been
performed
the
effect
of
all
the
prodigies
of
organization
i
began
to
know
what
lord
kitchener
and
those
who
had
worked
with
him
had
done
system
ruled
everything
at
folkestone
nothing
it
seemed
to
me
as
officers
explained
as
much
as
they
properly
could
had
been
left
to
chance
here
was
order
indeed
in
the
air
above
us
airplanes
flew
to
and
fro
they
circled
about
like
great
watchful
hawks
they
looped
and
whirled
around
cutting
this
way
and
that
circling
always
and
i
knew
that
as
they
flew
about
outside
the
harbor
the
men
in
them
were
never
off
their
guard
that
they
were
peering
down
watching
every
moment
for
the
first
trace
of
a
submarine
that
might
have
crept
through
the
more
remote
defenses
of
the
channel
let
a
submarine
appear
its
shrift
would
be
short
indeed
there
above
waited
the
airplanes
and
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
sinister
destroyers
darted
about
as
watchful
as
the
flyers
above
ready
for
any
emergency
that
might
arise
i
have
no
doubt
that
submarines
of
our
own
lurked
below
waiting
too
to
do
their
part
but
those
if
any
there
were
i
did
not
see
and
one
asks
no
questions
at
a
place
like
folkestone
i
was
glad
of
any
information
an
officer
might
voluntarily
give
me
but
it
was
not
for
me
or
any
other
loyal
briton
to
put
him
in
the
position
of
having
to
refuse
to
answer
soon
a
great
transport
was
pointed
out
to
me
lying
beside
the
jetty
gangplanks
were
down
and
up
them
streams
of
men
in
khaki
moved
endlessly
up
they
went
in
an
endless
brown
river
to
disappear
into
the
ship
the
whole
ship
was
a
very
hive
of
activity
not
only
men
were
going
aboard
but
supplies
of
every
sort
boxes
of
ammunition
stores
food
and
i
understood
and
was
presently
to
see
that
beyond
her
sides
there
was
the
same
ordered
scene
as
prevailed
on
shore
every
man
knew
his
task
the
stowing
away
of
everything
that
was
being
carried
aboard
was
being
carried
out
systematically
and
with
the
utmost
possible
economy
of
time
and
effort
that
the
ship
you
will
cross
the
channel
on
i
was
told
and
i
regarded
her
with
a
new
interest
i
do
not
know
what
part
she
had
been
wont
to
play
in
time
of
peace
what
useful
pleasant
journeys
it
had
been
her
part
to
complete
i
only
knew
that
she
was
to
carry
me
to
france
and
to
the
place
where
my
heart
was
and
for
a
long
time
had
been
me
and
two
thousand
men
who
were
to
be
of
real
use
over
there
we
were
nearly
the
last
to
go
on
board
we
found
the
decks
swarming
with
men
ah
the
braw
laddies
they
smoked
and
they
laughed
as
they
settled
themselves
for
the
trip
never
a
one
looked
as
though
he
might
be
sorry
to
be
there
they
were
leaving
behind
them
all
the
good
things
all
the
pleasant
things
of
life
as
in
time
of
peace
every
one
of
them
had
learned
to
live
it
and
to
know
it
long
long
since
had
the
last
illusion
faded
of
the
old
days
when
war
had
seemed
a
thing
of
pomp
and
circumstance
and
glory
they
knew
well
those
boys
what
it
was
they
faced
hard
grinding
work
they
could
look
forward
to
doing
such
work
as
few
of
them
had
ever
known
in
the
old
days
death
and
wounds
they
could
reckon
upon
as
the
portion
of
just
about
so
many
of
them
there
would
be
bitter
cold
later
in
the
trenches
and
mud
and
standing
for
hours
in
icy
mud
and
water
there
would
be
hard
fare
and
scanty
sometimes
when
things
went
wrong
there
would
be
gas
attacks
and
the
bursting
of
shells
about
them
with
all
sorts
of
poisons
in
them
always
there
would
be
the
deadliest
perils
of
these
perilous
days
but
they
sang
as
they
set
out
upon
the
great
adventure
of
their
lives
they
smiled
and
laughed
they
cheered
me
so
that
the
tears
started
from
my
eyes
when
they
saw
me
and
they
called
the
gayest
of
gay
greetings
though
they
knew
that
i
was
going
only
for
a
little
while
and
that
many
of
them
had
set
foot
on
british
soil
for
the
last
time
the
steady
babble
of
their
voices
came
to
our
ears
and
they
swarmed
below
us
like
ants
as
they
disposed
themselves
about
the
decks
and
made
the
most
of
the
scanty
space
that
was
allowed
for
them
the
trip
was
to
be
short
of
course
there
were
too
few
ships
and
the
problems
of
convoy
were
too
great
to
make
it
possible
to
make
the
voyage
a
comfortable
one
it
was
a
case
of
getting
them
over
as
might
best
be
arranged
a
word
of
command
rang
out
and
was
passed
around
by
officers
and
non
coms
life
belts
must
be
put
on
before
the
ship
sails
that
simple
order
brought
home
the
grim
facts
of
war
at
that
moment
as
scarcely
anything
else
could
have
done
here
was
a
grim
warning
of
the
peril
that
lurked
outside
everywhere
men
were
scurrying
to
obey
i
among
the
rest
the
order
applied
as
much
to
us
civilians
as
it
did
to
any
of
the
soldiers
and
my
belt
did
not
fit
and
was
hard
extremely
hard
for
me
to
don
i
could
no
manage
it
at
all
by
myself
but
adam
and
hogge
had
had
an
easier
time
with
theirs
and
they
came
to
my
help
among
us
we
got
mine
on
and
hogge
stood
off
and
looked
at
me
and
smiled
an
extraordinary
effect
harry
he
said
with
a
smile
i
declare
it
gives
you
the
most
charming
embonpoint
i
had
my
doubts
about
his
use
of
the
word
charming
i
know
that
i
should
not
have
cared
to
have
anyone
judge
of
my
looks
from
a
picture
taken
as
i
looked
then
had
one
been
taken
but
it
was
not
a
time
for
such
thoughts
for
a
civilian
especially
and
one
not
used
to
journeys
in
such
times
as
these
there
is
a
thrill
and
a
solemnity
about
the
donning
of
a
life
preserver
i
felt
that
i
was
indeed
it
might
be
taking
a
risk
in
making
this
journey
and
it
was
an
awesome
thought
that
i
too
might
have
seen
my
native
land
for
the
last
time
and
said
a
real
to
those
whom
i
had
left
behind
me
now
we
cast
off
and
began
to
move
and
a
thrill
ran
through
me
such
as
i
had
never
known
before
in
all
my
life
i
went
to
the
rail
as
we
turned
our
nose
toward
the
open
sea
a
destroyer
was
ahead
another
was
beside
us
others
rode
steadily
along
on
either
side
it
was
the
most
reassuring
of
sights
to
see
them
they
looked
so
business
like
so
capable
i
could
not
imagine
a
hun
submarine
as
able
to
evade
their
watchfulness
and
moreover
there
were
the
watchful
man
birds
above
us
the
circling
airplanes
that
could
make
out
so
much
better
than
could
any
lookout
on
a
ship
the
first
trace
of
the
presence
of
a
tin
fish
no
i
was
not
afraid
i
trusted
in
the
british
navy
which
had
guarded
the
sea
lane
so
well
that
not
a
man
had
lost
his
life
as
the
result
of
a
hun
attack
although
many
millions
had
gone
back
and
forth
to
france
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
i
did
not
stay
with
my
own
party
i
preferred
to
move
about
among
the
soldiers
i
was
deeply
interested
in
them
as
i
have
always
been
and
i
wanted
to
make
friends
among
them
and
see
how
they
felt
lor
lumme
its
old
lauder
said
one
cockney
god
bless
you
many
the
time
i
sung
with
you
in
the
it
good
to
see
you
with
us
and
so
i
was
greeted
everywhere
man
after
man
crowded
around
me
to
shake
hands
it
brought
a
lump
into
my
throat
to
be
greeted
so
and
it
made
me
more
than
ever
glad
that
the
military
authorities
had
been
able
to
see
their
way
to
grant
my
request
it
confirmed
my
belief
that
i
was
going
where
i
might
be
really
useful
to
the
men
who
were
ready
and
willing
to
make
the
greatest
of
all
sacrifices
in
the
cause
so
close
to
all
our
hearts
when
i
first
went
aboard
the
transport
i
picked
up
a
little
gold
stripe
it
was
one
of
those
men
wear
who
have
been
wounded
as
a
badge
of
honor
i
hoped
i
might
be
able
to
find
the
man
who
had
lost
it
and
return
it
to
him
but
none
of
them
claimed
it
and
i
have
kept
it
to
this
day
as
a
souvenir
of
that
voyage
it
was
easy
for
them
to
know
me
i
wore
my
kilt
and
my
cap
and
my
knife
in
my
stocking
as
i
have
always
done
on
the
stage
and
nearly
always
off
it
as
well
and
so
they
recognized
me
without
difficulty
and
never
a
one
called
me
anything
but
harry
except
when
it
was
i
think
i
would
be
much
affronted
if
ever
a
british
soldier
called
me
lauder
i
do
know
because
not
one
of
them
ever
did
and
i
hope
none
ever
will
they
told
me
that
there
were
men
from
the
highlands
on
board
and
i
went
looking
for
them
and
found
them
after
a
time
though
going
about
that
ship
so
crowded
she
was
was
no
easy
matter
they
were
gordon
highlanders
mostly
i
found
and
they
were
glad
to
see
me
and
made
me
welcome
and
i
had
a
pipe
with
them
and
a
good
talk
many
of
them
were
going
back
after
having
been
at
home
recuperating
from
wounds
and
they
and
the
new
men
too
were
all
eager
and
anxious
to
be
put
there
and
at
work
gie
us
a
chance
at
the
huns
it
all
we
asking
said
one
of
a
new
draft
they
telling
us
they
do
like
the
sight
of
our
kilts
harry
and
that
a
hun
got
less
stomach
for
the
cold
steel
of
a
bayonet
than
for
anything
else
on
earth
weel
we
carrying
a
dose
of
it
for
them
and
the
men
who
had
been
out
before
and
were
taking
back
with
them
the
scars
they
had
earned
were
just
as
anxious
as
the
rest
that
was
the
spirit
of
every
man
on
board
they
did
not
like
war
as
war
but
they
knew
that
this
was
a
war
that
must
be
fought
to
the
finish
and
never
a
man
of
them
wanted
peace
to
come
until
fritz
had
learned
his
lesson
to
the
bottom
of
lie
last
grim
page
i
never
heard
a
word
of
the
danger
of
meeting
a
submarine
the
idea
that
one
might
send
a
torpedo
after
us
popped
into
my
mind
once
or
twice
but
when
it
did
i
looked
out
at
the
destroyers
guarding
us
and
the
airplanes
above
and
i
felt
as
safe
as
if
i
had
been
in
bed
in
my
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
it
was
a
true
highway
of
war
that
those
whippets
of
the
sea
had
made
the
channel
crossing
ahm
but
i
was
proud
that
day
of
the
british
navy
it
is
a
great
task
that
it
has
performed
and
nobly
it
has
done
it
and
it
was
proud
and
glad
i
was
again
when
we
sighted
land
as
we
soon
did
and
i
knew
that
i
was
gazing
for
the
first
time
since
war
had
been
declared
upon
the
shores
of
our
great
ally
france
it
was
the
great
day
and
the
proud
day
and
the
happy
day
for
me
i
was
near
the
realizing
of
an
old
dream
i
had
often
had
i
was
with
the
soldiers
who
had
my
love
and
my
devotion
and
i
was
coming
to
france
the
france
that
every
scotchman
learns
to
love
at
his
mother
breast
a
stir
ran
through
the
men
orders
began
to
fly
and
i
went
back
to
my
place
and
my
party
soon
we
would
be
ashore
and
i
would
be
in
the
way
of
beginning
the
work
i
had
come
to
do

boulogne
like
folkestone
boulogne
in
happier
times
had
been
a
watering
place
less
fashionable
than
some
on
the
french
coast
but
the
pleasant
resort
of
many
in
search
of
health
and
pleasure
and
like
folkestone
it
had
suffered
the
blight
of
war
the
war
had
laid
its
heavy
hand
upon
the
port
it
ruled
everything
it
was
omnipresent
from
the
moment
when
we
came
into
full
view
of
the
harbor
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
anything
else
folkestone
had
made
me
think
of
the
mouth
of
a
great
funnel
into
which
all
broad
britain
had
been
pouring
men
and
guns
and
all
the
manifold
supplies
and
stores
of
modern
war
and
the
trip
across
the
narrow
well
guarded
lane
in
the
channel
had
been
like
the
pouring
of
water
through
the
neck
of
that
same
funnel
here
in
boulogne
was
the
opening
here
the
stream
of
men
and
spread
out
to
begin
its
orderly
irresistible
flow
to
the
front
all
of
northern
france
and
belgium
lay
before
that
stream
it
had
to
cover
all
the
great
length
of
the
british
front
not
from
boulogne
alone
of
course
i
knew
of
dunkirk
and
calais
and
guessed
at
other
ports
there
were
other
funnels
and
into
all
of
them
day
after
day
britain
was
pouring
her
tribute
through
all
of
them
she
was
offering
her
sacrifice
to
be
laid
upon
the
altar
of
strife
here
much
more
than
at
folkestone
as
it
chanced
i
saw
at
once
another
thing
there
was
a
double
funnel
the
stream
ran
both
ways
for
as
we
steamed
into
boulogne
a
ship
was
coming
out
a
ship
with
a
grim
and
tragic
burden
she
was
one
of
our
hospital
ships
but
she
was
guarded
as
carefully
by
destroyers
and
aircraft
as
our
transport
had
been
the
red
cross
meant
nothing
to
the
hun
except
perhaps
a
shining
target
ship
after
ship
that
bore
that
symbol
of
mercy
and
of
pain
had
been
sunk
no
longer
did
our
navy
dare
to
trust
the
red
cross
it
took
every
precaution
it
could
take
to
protect
the
poor
fellows
who
were
going
home
to
blighty
as
we
made
our
way
slowly
in
through
the
crowded
harbor
full
of
transports
of
ammunition
ships
of
food
carriers
of
destroyers
and
small
naval
craft
of
all
sorts
i
began
to
be
able
to
see
more
and
more
of
what
was
afoot
ashore
it
was
near
noon
the
day
that
had
been
chosen
for
my
arrival
in
france
was
one
of
brilliant
sunshine
and
a
cloudless
sky
and
my
eyes
were
drawn
to
other
hospital
ships
that
were
waiting
at
the
docks
motor
ambulances
came
dashing
up
one
after
the
other
in
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
endless
stream
the
pity
of
that
sight
it
was
as
if
i
could
peer
through
the
intervening
space
and
see
the
bandaged
heads
the
places
where
limbs
had
been
the
steadfast
gaze
of
the
boys
who
were
being
carried
up
in
stretchers
they
had
done
their
task
a
great
number
of
them
they
had
given
all
that
god
would
let
them
give
to
king
and
country
life
was
left
to
them
to
be
sure
most
of
these
boys
were
sure
to
live
but
to
what
maimed
and
incomplete
lives
were
they
doomed
the
thousands
who
would
be
cripples
always
blind
some
of
them
and
helpless
dependent
upon
what
others
might
choose
or
be
able
to
do
for
them
it
was
then
in
that
moment
that
an
idea
was
born
vaguely
in
my
mind
of
which
i
shall
have
much
more
to
say
later
there
was
beauty
in
that
harbor
of
boulogne
the
sun
gleamed
against
the
chalk
cliffs
it
caught
the
wings
of
airplanes
flying
high
above
us
but
there
was
little
of
beauty
in
my
mind
eye
that
could
see
through
the
surface
beauty
of
the
scene
and
of
the
day
to
the
grim
stark
ugliness
of
war
that
lay
beneath
i
saw
the
ordered
piles
of
boxes
and
supplies
the
bright
guns
with
the
sun
reflected
from
their
barrels
dulled
though
these
were
to
prevent
that
very
thing
and
i
thought
of
the
waste
that
was
involved
of
how
all
this
vast
product
of
industry
was
destined
to
be
destroyed
as
swiftly
as
might
be
bringing
no
useful
accomplishment
with
its
destruction
save
of
course
that
accomplishment
which
must
be
completed
before
any
useful
thing
may
be
done
again
in
this
world
then
we
went
ashore
and
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
we
were
indeed
in
france
that
land
which
friends
though
our
nations
are
is
at
heart
and
in
spirit
so
different
from
my
own
country
boulogne
had
ceased
to
be
french
indeed
the
port
was
like
a
bit
of
britain
picked
up
carried
across
the
channel
and
transplanted
successfully
to
a
new
english
was
spoken
everywhere
and
much
of
it
was
the
english
of
the
cockney
innocent
of
the
aitch
and
redolent
of
that
strange
tongue
but
it
is
no
for
me
a
scot
to
speak
of
how
any
other
man
uses
the
king
english
well
i
ken
it
it
was
good
to
hear
it
had
there
been
a
thought
in
my
mind
of
being
homesick
it
would
quickly
have
been
dispelled
the
streets
rang
to
the
tread
of
british
soldiers
our
uniform
was
everywhere
there
were
frenchmen
too
they
were
attached
many
of
them
for
one
reason
and
another
to
the
british
forces
but
most
of
them
spoke
english
too
i
had
most
care
about
the
unloading
of
my
cigarettes
it
was
a
point
of
honor
with
me
by
now
after
the
way
my
friends
had
joked
me
about
them
to
see
that
every
last
one
of
the
fags
i
had
brought
with
me
reached
a
british
tommy
so
to
them
i
gave
my
first
care
then
i
saw
to
the
unloading
of
my
wee
piano
and
having
done
so
was
free
to
go
with
the
other
members
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
to
the
small
hotel
that
was
to
be
headquarters
for
all
of
us
in
boulogne
arrangements
had
to
be
made
for
my
debut
in
france
and
i
can
tell
you
that
no
professional
engagement
i
have
ever
filled
ever
gave
me
half
so
much
concern
as
this
one
i
have
sung
before
many
strange
audiences
in
all
parts
of
the
world
or
nearly
all
i
have
sung
for
folk
who
had
no
idea
of
what
to
expect
from
me
and
have
known
that
i
must
be
at
work
from
the
moment
of
my
first
appearance
on
the
stage
to
win
them
but
these
audiences
that
i
was
to
face
here
in
france
gave
me
more
thought
than
any
of
them
i
had
so
great
a
reason
for
wanting
to
suceed
with
them
and
here
ye
ken
i
faced
conditions
that
were
harder
than
had
ever
fallen
to
my
lot
i
was
not
to
have
most
of
the
time
even
the
military
theaters
that
had
in
some
cases
been
built
for
the
men
behind
the
lines
where
many
actors
and
indeed
whole
companies
from
home
had
been
appearing
i
could
make
no
changes
of
costume
i
would
have
no
orchestra
part
of
the
time
i
would
have
my
wee
piano
but
i
reckoned
on
going
to
places
where
even
that
sma
thing
could
no
follow
me
but
i
had
a
good
manager
the
british
army
no
less
it
was
the
army
that
had
arranged
my
booking
we
were
not
left
alone
not
for
a
minute
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
we
were
left
to
go
around
on
our
own
and
as
we
pleased
far
from
it
no
sooner
had
we
landed
than
captain
roberts
told
me
in
a
brief
soldierly
way
that
was
also
extremely
businesslike
what
sort
of
plans
had
been
made
for
us
we
have
a
number
of
big
hospitals
here
he
said
this
is
one
of
the
important
british
bases
as
you
know
and
it
is
one
of
those
where
many
of
our
men
are
treated
before
they
are
sent
home
so
since
you
are
here
we
thought
you
would
want
to
give
your
first
concerts
to
the
wounded
men
here
so
i
learned
that
the
opening
of
what
you
might
call
my
engagement
in
the
trenches
was
to
be
in
hospitals
that
was
not
new
to
me
and
yet
i
was
to
find
that
there
was
a
difference
between
a
base
hospital
in
france
and
the
sort
of
hospitals
i
had
seen
so
often
at
home
nothing
indeed
was
left
to
us
after
captain
roberts
had
explained
matters
we
met
captain
godfrey
who
was
to
travel
with
us
and
be
our
guide
our
military
mentor
and
our
ruler
we
understood
that
we
must
place
ourselves
under
him
and
under
military
discipline
no
tommy
indeed
was
more
under
discipline
than
we
had
to
be
but
we
did
not
chafe
civilians
though
we
were
when
you
see
the
british
army
at
work
nothing
is
further
from
your
thoughts
than
to
criticize
or
to
offer
any
suggestions
it
knows
its
business
and
does
it
quietly
and
without
fuss
but
even
fritz
has
learned
to
be
chary
of
getting
in
the
way
when
the
british
army
has
made
up
its
mind
and
that
is
what
he
is
there
for
though
i
no
doubt
that
fritz
himself
would
give
a
pretty
penny
to
be
at
home
again
with
peace
declared
captain
godfrey
absolute
though
his
power
over
us
was
he
could
have
ordered
us
all
home
at
a
moment
notice
turned
out
to
be
a
delightful
young
officer
who
did
everything
in
his
power
to
make
our
way
smooth
and
pleasant
and
who
was
certainly
as
good
a
manager
as
i
ever
had
or
ever
expect
to
have
he
entered
into
the
spirit
of
our
tour
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
it
would
be
a
success
from
start
to
finish
if
it
were
within
his
power
to
make
it
so
he
liked
to
call
himself
my
manager
and
took
a
great
delight
indeed
in
the
whole
experience
well
it
was
a
change
for
him
no
doubt
i
had
brought
a
piano
with
me
but
no
accompanist
that
was
not
an
oversight
it
was
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
i
had
been
told
before
i
left
home
that
i
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
some
one
among
the
soldiers
to
accompany
me
and
that
was
true
as
i
soon
found
in
fact
as
i
was
to
learn
later
i
could
have
recruited
a
full
orchestra
among
the
tommies
and
i
would
have
had
in
my
band
too
musicians
of
fame
and
great
ability
far
above
the
average
theater
orchestra
oh
you
must
go
to
france
to
learn
how
every
art
and
craft
in
britain
has
done
its
part
aye
every
sort
of
artist
and
artisan
men
of
every
profession
and
trade
can
be
found
in
the
british
army
it
has
taken
them
all
like
some
great
melting
pot
and
made
them
soldiers
i
think
indeed
there
is
no
calling
that
you
could
name
that
would
not
yield
you
a
master
hand
from
the
ranks
of
the
british
army
and
i
am
not
talking
of
the
officers
alone
but
of
the
great
mass
of
tommies
and
so
when
i
told
captain
godfrey
i
would
be
needing
a
good
pianist
to
play
my
accompaniments
he
just
smiled
right
you
are
he
said
we
turn
one
up
for
you
in
no
time
he
had
no
doubts
at
all
and
he
was
right
they
found
a
lad
called
johnson
a
yorkshireman
in
a
convalescent
ward
of
one
of
the
big
hospitals
he
was
recovering
from
an
illness
he
had
incurred
in
the
trenches
and
was
not
quite
ready
to
go
back
to
active
duty
but
he
was
well
enough
to
play
for
me
and
delighted
when
he
heard
he
might
get
the
assignment
he
was
nervous
lest
he
should
not
please
me
and
feared
i
might
ask
for
another
man
but
when
i
ran
over
with
him
the
songs
i
meant
to
sing
i
found
he
played
the
piano
very
well
indeed
and
had
a
knack
for
accompanying
too
there
are
good
pianists
soloists
who
are
not
good
accompanists
it
takes
more
than
just
the
ability
to
play
the
piano
to
work
with
a
singer
and
especially
with
a
singer
like
me
it
is
no
straight
ahead
singing
i
do
always
as
you
ken
perhaps
but
i
saw
at
once
that
johnson
and
i
would
get
along
fine
together
so
everyone
was
pleased
and
i
went
on
and
made
my
preparations
with
him
for
my
first
concert
that
was
to
be
in
the
boulogne
casino
center
of
the
gayety
of
the
resort
in
the
old
days
but
now
for
a
long
time
turned
into
a
base
hospital
they
had
played
for
high
stakes
there
in
the
old
days
before
the
war
thousands
of
dollars
had
changed
hands
in
an
hour
there
but
they
were
playing
for
higher
stakes
now
they
were
playing
for
the
lives
and
the
health
of
men
and
the
hearts
of
the
women
at
home
in
britain
who
were
bound
up
with
them
in
the
old
days
men
had
staked
their
money
against
the
turn
of
a
card
or
the
roll
of
the
wheel
but
now
it
was
with
death
they
staked
and
it
was
a
mightier
game
than
those
old
walls
had
ever
seen
before
the
largest
ward
of
the
hospital
was
in
what
had
been
the
baccarat
room
and
it
was
there
i
held
my
first
concert
of
the
trench
engagement
when
i
appeared
it
was
packed
full
there
were
men
on
cots
lying
still
and
helpless
bandaged
to
their
very
eyes
some
came
limping
in
on
their
crutches
some
were
rolled
in
in
chairs
it
was
a
sad
scene
and
an
impressive
one
and
it
went
to
my
heart
when
i
thought
that
my
own
poor
laddie
must
have
lain
in
just
such
a
room
in
this
very
one
perhaps
he
had
suffered
as
these
men
were
suffering
and
he
had
died
as
some
of
these
men
for
whom
i
was
to
sing
would
die
for
there
were
men
here
who
would
be
patched
up
presently
and
would
go
back
and
for
them
there
might
be
a
next
time
a
next
time
when
they
would
need
no
hospital
there
was
one
thing
about
the
place
i
liked
it
was
so
clean
and
white
and
spotless
all
the
garish
display
the
paint
and
tawdry
finery
of
the
old
gambling
days
had
gone
it
was
restful
now
and
though
there
was
the
hospital
smell
it
was
a
clean
smell
and
the
men
looked
as
though
they
had
wonderful
care
indeed
i
knew
they
had
that
i
knew
that
everything
that
could
be
done
to
ease
their
state
was
being
done
and
every
face
i
saw
was
brave
and
cheerful
though
the
skin
of
many
and
many
a
lad
was
stretched
tight
over
his
bones
with
the
pain
he
had
known
and
there
was
a
look
in
their
eyes
a
look
with
no
repining
in
it
or
complaint
but
with
the
evidences
of
a
terrible
pain
bravely
suffered
that
sent
the
tears
starting
to
my
eyes
more
than
once
it
was
much
as
it
had
been
in
the
many
hospitals
i
had
visited
in
britain
and
yet
it
was
different
too
i
felt
that
i
was
really
at
the
front
later
i
came
to
realize
how
far
from
the
real
front
i
actually
was
at
boulogne
but
then
i
knew
no
better
i
had
chosen
my
programme
carefully
it
was
made
up
of
songs
altogether
i
had
had
enough
experience
in
hospitals
and
camps
by
now
to
have
learned
what
soldiers
liked
best
and
i
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
was
just
songs
and
best
of
all
they
liked
the
old
love
songs
and
the
old
songs
of
scotland
tender
crooning
melodies
that
would
help
to
carry
them
back
in
memory
to
their
hames
and
if
they
had
them
to
the
lassies
of
their
dreams
it
was
no
sad
lugubrious
songs
they
wanted
but
a
note
of
wistful
tenderness
they
liked
that
was
true
of
sick
and
wounded
and
of
the
hale
and
hearty
too
and
it
showed
that
though
they
were
soldiers
they
were
just
humans
like
the
rest
of
us
for
all
the
great
and
things
they
done
out
there
in
france
not
every
actor
and
artist
who
has
tried
to
help
in
the
hospitals
has
fully
understood
the
men
he
or
she
wanted
to
please
they
meant
well
every
one
but
some
were
a
wee
bit
unfortunate
in
the
way
they
went
to
work
there
is
a
story
that
is
told
of
one
of
our
really
great
serious
actors
he
is
serious
minded
always
on
the
stage
and
off
and
very
very
dignified
but
some
folk
went
to
him
and
asked
him
would
he
no
do
his
bit
to
cheer
up
the
puir
laddies
in
a
hospital
he
never
thought
of
refusing
and
i
would
no
have
you
think
i
am
sneering
at
the
man
his
intentions
were
of
the
best
of
course
i
do
not
sing
or
dance
he
said
drawing
down
his
lip
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
showed
what
he
thought
of
such
of
us
as
had
descended
to
such
low
ways
of
pleasing
the
public
that
paid
to
see
us
and
to
hear
us
but
i
shall
very
gladly
do
something
to
bring
a
little
diversion
into
the
sad
lives
of
the
poor
boys
in
the
hospitals
it
was
a
stretcher
audience
that
he
had
that
means
a
lot
of
boys
who
had
to
lie
in
bed
to
hear
him
they
needed
cheering
and
that
great
actor
with
all
his
good
intentions
could
think
of
nothing
more
fitting
than
to
stand
up
before
them
and
begin
to
recite
in
a
sad
elocutionary
tone
longfellow
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
he
went
on
and
his
voice
gained
power
he
had
come
to
the
third
stanza
or
the
fourth
maybe
when
a
command
rang
out
through
the
ward
it
was
one
that
had
been
heard
many
and
many
a
time
in
france
along
the
trenches
it
came
from
one
of
the
beds
to
cover
men
came
the
order
it
rang
out
through
the
ward
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
on
the
word
every
man
head
popped
under
the
bedclothes
and
the
great
actor
astonished
beyond
measure
was
left
there
reciting
away
to
shaking
mounds
of
bedclothes
that
entrenched
his
hearers
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
well
i
had
heard
yon
tale
i
do
no
think
i
should
ever
have
risked
a
similar
fate
by
making
the
same
sort
of
mistake
but
i
profited
by
hearing
it
and
i
always
remembered
it
and
there
was
another
thing
i
never
thought
when
i
was
going
to
sing
for
soldiers
that
i
was
doing
something
for
them
that
should
make
them
glad
to
listen
to
me
no
matter
what
i
chose
to
sing
for
them
i
always
thought
instead
that
here
was
an
audience
that
had
paid
to
hear
me
in
the
dearest
coin
in
all
the
world
their
legs
and
arms
their
health
and
happiness
oh
they
had
paid
they
had
not
come
in
on
free
passes
their
tickets
had
cost
them
dear
dearer
than
tickets
for
the
theater
had
ever
cost
before
i
owed
them
more
than
i
could
ever
pay
my
own
future
and
my
freedom
and
the
right
and
the
chance
to
go
on
living
in
my
own
country
free
from
the
threat
and
the
menace
of
the
hun
it
was
for
me
to
please
those
boys
when
i
sang
for
them
and
to
make
such
an
effort
as
no
ordinary
audience
had
ever
heard
from
me
they
had
made
a
little
platform
to
serve
as
a
stage
for
me
there
was
room
for
me
and
for
johnson
and
for
the
wee
piano
and
so
i
sang
for
them
and
they
showed
me
from
the
start
that
they
were
pleased
those
who
could
clapped
and
all
cheered
and
after
each
song
there
was
a
great
pounding
of
crutches
on
the
floor
it
was
an
inspiring
sound
and
a
great
sight
sad
though
it
was
to
see
and
to
hear
when
i
had
done
i
went
aboot
amang
the
men
shaking
hands
with
such
as
could
gie
me
their
hands
and
saying
a
word
or
two
to
all
of
them
directly
in
front
of
the
platform
there
lay
a
wounded
scots
soldier
and
all
through
my
concert
he
watched
me
most
intently
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
me
when
i
had
sung
my
last
song
he
beckoned
to
me
feebly
and
i
went
to
him
and
bent
over
to
listen
to
him
eh
harry
man
he
said
will
ye
be
doin
me
a
favor
aye
that
i
will
if
i
can
i
told
him
it
to
ask
the
doctor
will
i
no
be
gettin
better
soon
because
harry
mon
i
but
the
one
desire
left
and
that
to
be
in
at
the
finish
of
yon
fight
i
was
to
give
one
more
concert
in
boulogne
that
night
that
was
more
cheerful
and
it
was
different
again
from
anything
i
had
done
or
known
before
there
was
a
convalescent
camp
about
two
miles
from
town
high
up
on
the
chalk
cliffs
and
this
time
my
theater
was
a
hut
but
do
not
let
the
name
hut
deceive
ye
i
had
an
audience
of
two
thousand
men
that
nicht
it
was
all
the
hut
would
hold
with
tight
squeezing
and
what
a
roaring
wild
crowd
that
was
to
be
sure
they
sang
with
me
and
they
cheered
and
clapped
until
i
thought
that
hut
would
be
needing
a
new
roof
i
had
to
give
over
at
last
for
i
was
tired
and
needed
sleep
we
had
our
orders
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
was
to
start
for
vimy
ridge
at
six
next
morning
chapter
xiv
we
were
up
next
morning
before
daybreak
but
i
did
not
feel
as
if
i
were
getting
up
early
indeed
it
was
quite
the
reverse
all
about
us
was
a
scene
of
such
activity
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
lying
in
bed
unconsciously
long
as
if
i
were
the
laziest
man
in
all
that
busy
town
troops
were
setting
out
boarding
military
trains
cheery
jovial
fellows
they
were
the
same
lads
some
of
them
who
had
crossed
the
channel
with
me
and
many
others
who
had
come
in
later
oh
it
is
a
steady
stream
of
men
and
supplies
indeed
that
goes
across
the
narrow
sea
to
france
motor
trucks
they
were
calling
them
camions
after
the
french
fashion
because
it
was
a
shorter
and
a
simpler
word
fairly
swarmed
in
the
streets
guns
rolled
ponderously
along
it
was
not
military
pomp
we
saw
indeed
i
saw
little
enough
of
that
in
france
it
was
only
the
uniforms
and
the
guns
that
made
me
realize
that
this
was
war
the
activity
was
more
that
of
a
busy
bustling
factory
town
it
was
not
english
and
it
was
not
french
i
think
it
made
me
think
more
of
an
american
city
war
i
can
not
tell
you
often
enough
is
a
great
business
a
vast
industry
in
these
days
someone
said
and
he
was
right
that
they
did
not
win
victories
any
more
that
they
manufactured
them
as
all
sorts
of
goods
are
manufactured
digging
and
building
that
is
the
great
work
of
modern
war
our
preparations
being
in
the
hands
of
captain
godfrey
and
the
british
army
were
few
and
easily
made
two
great
fast
army
motor
cars
had
been
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
and
when
we
went
out
to
get
into
them
and
make
our
start
it
was
just
a
problem
of
stowing
away
all
we
had
to
carry
with
us
the
first
car
was
a
passenger
car
each
motor
had
a
soldier
as
chauffeur
i
and
the
reverend
george
adam
rode
in
the
tonneau
of
the
leading
car
and
captain
godfrey
our
manager
and
guide
sat
with
the
driver
in
front
that
was
where
he
belonged
and
where
being
a
british
officer
he
naturally
wanted
to
be
they
have
called
our
officers
reckless
and
said
that
they
risked
their
lives
too
freely
weel
i
dinna
ken
i
am
no
soldier
but
i
know
what
a
glorious
tradition
the
british
officer
has
and
i
know
too
how
his
men
follow
him
they
know
do
the
laddies
in
the
ranks
that
their
officers
will
never
ask
them
to
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
they
would
shirk
themselves
and
that
makes
for
a
spirit
that
you
could
not
esteem
too
highly
it
was
the
second
car
that
was
our
problem
we
put
johnson
my
accompanist
in
the
tonneau
first
and
then
we
covered
him
with
cigarettes
it
was
a
problem
to
get
them
stowed
away
and
when
we
had
accomplished
the
task
finally
there
was
not
much
of
johnson
to
be
seen
he
was
covered
and
surrounded
with
cigarettes
but
he
was
snug
and
he
looked
happy
and
comfortable
as
he
grinned
at
us
his
face
was
about
all
of
him
that
we
could
see
hogge
rode
in
front
with
the
driver
of
that
car
and
had
more
room
so
than
he
would
have
had
in
the
tonneau
where
as
a
passenger
and
a
guest
he
really
belonged
the
wee
bit
piano
was
lashed
to
the
grid
of
the
second
car
and
i
give
you
my
word
it
looked
like
a
gypsy
wagon
more
than
like
one
of
the
neat
cars
of
the
british
army
weel
all
was
ready
in
due
time
and
it
was
just
six
when
we
set
off
there
was
a
thing
i
noted
again
and
again
the
army
did
things
on
time
in
france
if
we
were
to
start
at
a
certain
time
we
always
did
nothing
ever
happened
to
make
us
unpunctual
it
was
a
glorious
morning
we
went
roaring
out
of
boulogne
on
a
road
that
was
as
hard
and
smooth
as
a
paved
street
in
london
despite
all
the
terrific
traffic
it
had
borne
since
the
war
made
boulogne
a
british
base
and
there
were
no
speed
limits
here
so
soon
as
the
cars
were
tuned
up
we
went
along
at
the
highest
speed
of
which
the
cars
were
capable
our
soldier
drivers
knew
their
business
only
the
picked
men
were
assigned
to
the
driving
of
these
cars
and
speed
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
wanted
of
them
much
may
hang
on
the
speed
of
a
motor
car
in
france
but
fast
as
we
traveled
we
did
not
go
too
fast
for
me
to
enjoy
the
drive
and
the
sights
and
sounds
that
were
all
about
us
they
were
oddly
mixed
some
were
homely
and
familiar
and
some
were
so
strange
that
i
could
not
give
over
wondering
at
them
the
motors
made
a
great
noise
but
it
was
not
too
loud
for
me
to
hear
larks
singing
in
the
early
morning
all
the
world
was
green
with
the
early
sun
upon
it
lighting
up
every
detail
of
a
strange
countryside
there
was
a
soft
wind
a
gentle
caressing
wind
that
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
trees
along
the
road
but
not
for
long
could
we
escape
the
touch
of
war
that
grim
etcher
was
at
work
upon
the
road
and
the
whole
countryside
as
we
went
on
we
were
bound
to
move
more
slowly
because
of
the
congestion
of
the
traffic
never
was
piccadilly
or
fifth
avenue
more
crowded
with
motors
at
the
busiest
hour
of
the
day
than
was
that
road
as
we
passed
through
villages
or
came
to
cross
roads
we
saw
military
police
directing
traffic
precisely
as
they
do
at
busy
intersections
of
crowded
streets
in
london
or
new
york
but
the
traffic
along
that
road
was
not
the
traffic
of
the
cities
here
were
no
ladies
gorgeously
clad
reclining
in
their
luxurious
deeply
upholstered
cars
here
were
no
footmen
and
chauffeurs
in
livery
ah
they
wore
a
livery
aye
but
it
was
the
livery
of
glory
the
khaki
of
the
king
generals
and
high
officers
passed
us
bowling
along
lolling
in
their
cars
taking
their
few
brief
minutes
or
half
hours
of
ease
smoking
and
talking
they
corresponded
to
the
limousines
and
landaulets
of
the
cities
and
there
were
wagons
from
the
shops
great
trucks
carrying
supplies
going
along
at
a
pace
that
racked
their
engines
and
their
bodies
and
that
boded
disaster
to
whoever
got
in
their
way
but
no
one
did
there
was
no
real
confusion
here
despite
the
seeming
madness
of
the
welter
of
traffic
that
we
saw
what
a
traffic
that
was
and
it
was
all
the
traffic
of
the
carnage
we
were
nearing
it
was
a
marvelous
and
an
impressive
panorama
of
force
and
of
destruction
that
we
saw
it
was
being
constantly
unrolled
before
my
wondering
eyes
as
we
traveled
along
the
road
out
of
old
boulogne
at
first
all
the
traffic
was
going
our
way
sometimes
there
came
a
warning
shriek
from
behind
and
everything
drew
to
one
side
to
make
room
for
a
dispatch
rider
on
a
motor
cycle
these
had
the
right
of
way
sir
douglas
haig
himself
were
he
driving
along
would
see
his
driver
turn
out
to
make
way
for
one
of
those
shrieking
motor
bikes
the
rule
is
absolute
everything
makes
way
for
them
but
it
was
not
long
before
a
tide
of
traffic
began
to
meet
us
flowing
back
toward
boulogne
there
was
a
double
stream
then
and
i
wondered
how
collisions
and
traffic
jams
of
all
sorts
could
be
avoided
i
do
not
know
yet
i
only
know
that
there
is
no
trouble
here
were
empty
trucks
speeding
back
for
new
loads
and
some
there
were
that
carried
all
sorts
of
wreckage
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
cast
up
on
the
safe
shores
behind
the
front
by
the
red
tide
of
war
nothing
is
thrown
away
out
there
nothing
is
wasted
great
piles
of
discarded
shoes
are
brought
back
to
be
made
over
they
are
as
good
as
new
when
they
come
back
from
the
factories
where
they
are
worked
over
indeed
the
men
told
me
they
were
better
than
new
because
they
were
less
trying
to
their
feet
and
did
not
need
so
much
breaking
in
men
go
about
behind
the
front
and
after
a
battle
picking
up
everything
that
has
been
thrown
away
everything
is
sorted
and
gone
over
with
the
utmost
care
rifles
that
have
been
thrown
away
or
dropped
when
men
were
wounded
or
killed
bits
of
uniforms
bayonets
everything
is
saved
reclamation
is
the
order
of
the
day
there
is
waste
enough
in
war
that
can
not
be
avoided
the
british
army
sees
to
it
that
there
is
none
that
is
avoidable
but
it
was
not
only
that
sort
of
wreckage
that
sort
of
driftwood
that
was
being
carried
back
to
be
made
over
presently
we
began
to
see
great
motor
ambulances
coming
along
each
with
a
red
cross
painted
glaringly
on
its
side
though
that
paint
was
wasted
or
worse
for
there
is
no
target
the
hun
loves
better
it
would
seem
than
the
great
red
cross
of
mercy
and
in
them
as
we
knew
there
was
the
most
pitiful
wreckage
of
all
the
human
wreckage
of
the
war
in
the
wee
sma
hours
of
the
morn
they
bear
the
men
back
who
have
been
hit
the
day
before
and
during
the
night
they
go
back
to
the
field
dressing
stations
and
the
hospitals
just
behind
the
front
to
be
sorted
like
the
other
wreckage
some
there
are
who
can
not
be
moved
further
at
first
but
must
he
cared
for
under
fire
lest
they
die
on
the
way
but
all
whose
wounds
are
such
that
they
can
safely
be
moved
go
back
in
the
ambulances
first
to
the
great
base
hospitals
and
then
when
possible
on
the
hospital
ships
to
england
sometimes
but
not
often
we
passed
troops
marching
along
the
road
they
swung
along
they
marched
easily
with
the
stride
that
could
carry
them
furthest
with
the
least
effort
they
did
not
look
much
like
the
troops
i
used
to
see
in
london
they
did
not
have
the
snap
of
the
coldstream
guards
marching
through
green
park
in
the
old
days
but
they
looked
like
business
and
like
war
they
looked
like
men
who
had
a
job
of
work
to
do
and
meant
to
see
it
through
they
had
discipline
those
laddies
but
it
was
not
the
old
stiff
discipline
of
the
old
army
that
is
a
thing
of
a
day
that
is
dead
and
gone
now
as
we
passed
along
the
side
of
the
road
that
marching
troops
always
leave
clear
there
was
always
a
series
of
hails
for
me
hello
harry
i
would
hear
and
i
would
look
back
and
see
grinning
tommies
waving
their
hands
to
me
it
was
a
flattering
experience
i
can
tell
you
to
be
recognized
like
that
along
that
road
it
was
like
running
into
old
friends
in
a
strange
town
where
you
have
come
thinking
you
know
no
one
at
all
we
were
about
thirty
miles
out
of
boulogne
when
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
underneath
the
car
followed
by
a
sibilant
sound
that
i
knew
only
too
well
hello
a
puncture
said
godfrey
and
smiled
as
he
turned
around
we
drew
up
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
both
chauffeurs
jumped
out
and
went
to
work
on
the
recalcitrant
tire
the
rest
of
us
sat
still
and
gazed
around
us
at
the
fields
i
was
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
look
quietly
about
the
fields
stretched
out
all
emerald
green
in
all
directions
to
the
distant
horizon
sapphire
blue
that
glorious
morning
and
in
the
fields
here
and
there
were
the
bent
stooped
figures
of
old
men
and
women
they
were
carrying
on
quietly
husbands
and
sons
and
brothers
had
gone
to
war
all
the
young
men
of
france
had
gone
these
were
left
and
they
were
seeing
to
the
performance
of
the
endless
cycle
of
duty
france
would
survive
the
hun
could
not
crush
her
here
was
a
spirit
made
manifest
a
spirit
different
in
degree
but
not
in
kind
from
the
spirit
of
my
ain
britain
it
brought
a
lump
into
my
throat
to
see
them
the
old
men
and
the
women
going
so
patiently
and
quietly
about
their
tasks
it
was
very
quiet
faint
sounds
came
to
us
there
was
a
distant
rumbling
like
the
muttering
of
thunder
on
a
summer
night
when
the
day
has
been
hot
and
there
are
low
black
clouds
lying
against
the
horizon
with
the
flashes
of
the
lightning
playing
through
them
but
that
i
had
come
already
not
to
heed
though
i
knew
full
well
by
now
what
it
was
and
what
it
meant
for
a
little
space
the
busy
road
had
become
clear
there
was
a
long
break
in
the
traffic
i
turned
to
adam
and
to
captain
godfrey
i
thinking
here
a
fine
chance
for
a
bit
of
a
rehearsal
in
the
open
air
i
said
i
not
used
to
singing
so
mayhap
it
would
be
well
to
try
my
voice
and
see
will
it
carry
as
it
should
right
oh
said
godfrey
and
so
we
dug
johnson
out
from
his
snug
barricade
of
cigarettes
that
hid
him
as
an
emplacement
hides
a
gun
and
we
unstrapped
my
wee
piano
and
set
it
up
in
the
road
johnson
tried
the
piano
and
then
we
began
i
think
i
never
sang
with
less
restraint
in
all
my
life
than
i
did
that
quiet
morning
on
the
boulogne
road
i
raised
my
voice
and
let
it
have
its
will
and
i
felt
my
spirits
rising
with
the
lilt
of
the
melody
my
voice
rang
out
full
and
free
and
it
must
have
carried
far
and
wide
across
the
fields
my
audience
was
small
at
first
captain
godfrey
hogge
adam
and
the
two
chauffeurs
working
away
and
having
more
trouble
with
the
tire
than
they
had
thought
at
first
they
would
which
is
the
way
of
tires
as
every
man
knows
who
owns
a
car
but
as
they
heard
my
songs
the
old
men
and
women
in
the
fields
straightened
up
to
listen
they
stood
wondering
at
first
and
then
slowly
they
gave
over
their
work
for
a
space
and
came
to
gather
round
me
and
to
listen
it
must
have
seemed
strange
to
them
indeed
it
must
have
seemed
strange
to
anyone
had
they
seen
and
heard
me
there
i
was
with
johnson
at
my
piano
like
some
wayside
tinker
setting
up
his
cart
and
working
at
his
trade
but
i
did
not
care
for
appearances
not
a
whit
for
the
moment
i
was
care
free
a
wandering
minstrel
like
some
troubadour
of
old
care
free
and
happy
in
my
song
i
forgot
the
black
shadow
under
which
we
all
lay
in
that
smiling
land
the
black
shadow
of
war
in
which
i
sang
it
delighted
me
to
see
those
old
peasants
and
to
study
their
faces
and
to
try
to
win
them
with
my
song
they
could
not
understand
a
word
i
sang
and
yet
i
saw
the
smiles
breaking
out
over
their
wrinkled
faces
and
it
made
me
proud
and
happy
for
it
was
plain
that
i
was
reaching
them
that
i
was
able
to
throw
a
bridge
over
the
gap
of
a
strange
tongue
and
an
alien
race
when
i
had
done
and
it
was
plain
i
meant
to
sing
no
more
they
clapped
me
there
a
hand
for
you
harry
said
adam
aye
and
i
proud
of
it
i
told
him
for
reply
i
was
almost
sorry
when
i
saw
that
the
two
chauffeurs
had
finished
their
repairs
and
were
ready
to
go
on
but
i
told
them
to
lash
the
piano
back
in
its
place
and
johnson
prepared
to
climb
gingerly
back
among
his
cigarettes
but
just
then
something
happened
that
i
had
not
expected
there
was
a
turn
in
the
road
just
beyond
us
that
hid
its
continuation
from
us
and
around
the
bend
now
there
came
a
company
of
soldiers
not
neat
and
soldiers
these
ah
no
they
were
fresh
from
the
trenches
on
their
way
back
to
rest
the
mud
and
grime
of
the
trenches
were
upon
them
they
were
tired
and
weary
and
they
carried
all
their
accoutrements
and
packs
with
them
their
boots
were
heavy
with
mud
and
they
looked
bad
and
many
of
them
shaky
most
of
these
men
godfrey
told
me
after
a
glance
at
them
had
been
ordered
back
to
hospital
for
minor
ailments
they
were
able
to
march
but
not
much
more
they
were
the
first
men
i
had
seen
in
such
a
case
they
looked
bad
enough
but
godfrey
said
they
were
happy
enough
some
of
them
would
get
leave
for
blighty
and
be
home
in
a
few
days
to
see
their
families
and
their
girls
and
they
came
swinging
along
in
fine
style
sick
and
tired
as
they
were
for
the
thought
of
where
they
were
going
cheered
them
and
helped
to
keep
them
going
a
british
soldier
equipped
for
the
trenches
on
his
way
in
or
out
has
quite
a
load
to
carry
he
has
his
pack
and
his
emergency
ration
and
his
entrenching
tools
and
extra
clothing
that
he
needs
in
bad
weather
in
the
trenches
to
say
nothing
of
his
rifle
and
the
sight
of
them
made
me
realize
for
the
first
time
the
truth
that
lay
behind
the
jest
in
a
story
that
is
one
of
tommy
favorites
a
child
saw
a
soldier
in
heavy
marching
order
she
gazed
at
him
in
wonder
he
was
not
her
idea
of
what
a
soldier
should
look
like
mother
she
asked
what
is
a
soldier
for
the
mother
gazed
at
the
man
and
then
she
smiled
a
soldier
she
answered
is
to
hang
things
on
they
eyed
me
very
curiously
as
they
came
along
those
sick
laddies
they
could
seem
to
understand
what
i
was
doing
there
but
their
discipline
held
them
they
were
in
charge
of
a
young
lieutenant
with
one
star
a
second
lieutenant
i
learned
later
that
he
was
a
long
way
from
being
a
well
man
himself
so
i
stopped
him
would
your
men
like
to
hear
a
few
songs
lieutenant
i
asked
him
he
hesitated
he
did
quite
understand
and
he
was
a
bit
sure
what
his
duty
was
in
the
circumstances
he
glanced
at
godfrey
and
godfrey
smiled
at
him
as
if
in
encouragement
it
very
good
of
you
i
sure
he
said
slowly
fall
out
so
the
men
fell
out
and
squatted
there
along
the
wayside
at
once
discipline
was
relaxed
their
faces
were
a
study
as
the
wee
piano
was
set
up
again
and
johnson
in
uniform
of
course
sat
down
and
trued
a
chord
or
two
and
then
suddenly
something
happened
that
broke
the
ice
just
as
i
stood
up
to
sing
a
loud
voice
broke
the
silence
lor
love
us
one
of
the
men
cried
if
it
ai
old
lauder
there
was
a
stir
of
interest
at
once
i
spotted
the
owner
of
the
voice
it
was
a
shriveled
up
little
chap
with
a
weazened
face
that
looked
like
a
apple
he
was
showing
all
his
teeth
in
a
grin
at
me
and
he
was
a
typical
little
cockney
of
the
sort
all
londoners
know
well
go
it
he
shouted
shrilly
many
the
time
h
i
you
at
the
old
shoreditch
so
i
went
it
as
well
as
i
could
and
i
never
did
have
a
more
appreciative
audience
my
little
cockney
friend
seemed
to
take
a
particular
personal
pride
in
me
i
think
he
thought
he
had
found
me
and
that
he
was
in
an
odd
way
responsible
for
my
success
with
his
mates
and
so
he
was
especially
glad
when
they
cheered
me
and
thanked
me
as
they
did
my
concert
did
last
long
for
we
had
to
be
getting
on
and
the
company
of
sick
men
had
just
so
much
time
too
to
reach
their
destination
boulogne
whence
we
had
set
out
when
it
was
over
i
said
to
the
men
and
shook
hands
with
particular
warmth
with
the
little
cockney
it
was
every
day
i
was
likely
to
meet
a
man
who
had
often
heard
me
at
the
old
shoreditch
after
we
had
stowed
johnson
and
the
piano
away
again
with
a
few
less
cigarettes
now
to
get
in
johnson
way
we
started
and
as
long
as
we
were
in
sight
the
little
cockney
and
i
were
waving
to
one
another
i
took
some
of
the
cigarettes
into
the
car
i
was
in
now
and
as
we
sped
along
we
were
again
in
the
thick
of
the
great
british
war
machine
motor
trucks
and
ambulances
were
more
frequent
than
ever
and
it
was
a
common
occurrence
now
to
pass
soldiers
marching
in
both
directions
to
the
front
and
away
from
it
there
was
always
to
recognize
me
and
start
a
volley
of
hello
harrys
coming
my
way
and
i
answered
every
greeting
you
may
be
sure
and
threw
cigarettes
to
go
with
my
hellos
aye
i
was
glad
i
had
brought
the
cigarettes
they
seemed
to
be
even
more
welcome
than
i
had
hoped
they
would
be
and
i
only
wondered
how
long
the
supply
would
hold
out
and
if
i
would
be
able
to
get
more
if
it
did
not
so
johnson
little
by
little
was
getting
more
room
as
i
called
for
more
and
more
of
the
cigarettes
that
walled
him
in
in
his
tonneau
about
noon
as
we
drove
through
a
little
town
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
whole
flock
of
airplanes
riding
the
sky
they
were
swooping
about
like
lazy
hawks
and
a
bonnie
sight
they
were
i
drew
a
long
breath
when
i
saw
them
and
turned
to
my
friend
adam
well
i
said
i
think
we
coming
to
it
now
i
meant
the
front
the
real
british
front
suddenly
at
a
sharp
order
from
captain
godfrey
our
cars
stopped
he
turned
around
to
us
and
grinned
very
cheerfully
gentlemen
he
said
very
calmly
we
stop
here
long
enough
to
put
on
our
steel
helmets
he
said
it
just
as
he
might
have
said
well
here
where
we
will
stop
for
tea
it
meant
no
more
than
that
to
him
but
for
me
it
meant
many
things
it
meant
that
at
last
i
was
really
to
be
under
fire
that
i
was
going
into
danger
i
was
not
really
frightened
yet
you
have
to
see
danger
and
know
just
what
it
is
and
appreciate
exactly
its
character
before
you
can
be
frightened
but
i
had
imagination
enough
to
know
what
that
order
meant
and
to
have
a
queer
feeling
as
i
donned
the
steel
helmet
it
was
less
uncomfortable
than
i
had
expected
it
to
be
lighter
and
easier
to
wear
the
british
trench
helmets
are
beautifully
made
now
as
in
every
other
phase
of
the
war
and
its
work
they
represent
a
constant
study
for
improvement
lightening
but
even
had
it
not
been
for
the
warning
that
was
implied
in
captain
godfrey
order
i
should
soon
have
understood
that
we
had
come
into
a
new
region
for
a
long
time
now
the
noise
of
the
guns
had
been
different
instead
of
being
like
distant
thunder
it
was
a
much
nearer
and
louder
sound
it
was
a
steady
throbbing
roar
now
and
at
intervals
there
came
a
different
sound
a
sound
more
individual
that
stood
out
from
the
steady
roar
it
was
as
if
the
air
were
being
cracked
apart
by
the
blow
of
some
giant
hammer
i
knew
what
it
was
aye
i
knew
you
need
no
man
to
tell
you
what
it
is
the
explosion
of
a
great
shell
not
so
far
from
you
nor
was
it
our
ears
alone
that
told
us
what
was
going
on
ever
and
anon
now
ahead
of
us
as
we
looked
at
the
fields
we
saw
a
cloud
of
dirt
rise
up
that
was
where
a
shell
struck
and
in
the
fields
about
us
now
we
could
see
holes
full
of
water
as
a
rule
and
mounds
of
dirt
that
did
not
look
as
if
shovels
and
picks
had
raised
them
it
surprised
me
to
see
that
the
peasants
were
still
at
work
i
spoke
to
godfrey
about
that
the
french
peasants
do
seem
to
know
what
it
is
to
be
afraid
of
he
said
they
go
only
when
we
make
them
it
is
the
same
on
the
french
front
they
will
cling
to
a
farmhouse
in
the
zone
of
fire
until
they
are
ordered
out
no
matter
how
heavily
it
may
be
shelled
they
are
splendid
folk
the
germans
can
never
beat
a
race
that
has
such
folk
as
that
behind
its
battle
line
i
could
well
believe
him
i
have
seen
no
sight
along
the
whole
front
more
quietly
impressive
than
the
calm
impassive
courage
of
those
french
peasants
they
know
they
are
right
it
is
no
kaiser
no
war
lord
who
gives
them
courage
it
is
the
knowledge
and
the
consciousness
that
they
are
suffering
in
a
holy
cause
and
that
in
the
end
the
right
and
the
truth
must
prevail
their
own
fate
whatever
may
befall
them
does
not
matter
france
must
go
on
and
shall
and
they
do
their
humble
part
to
see
that
she
does
and
shall
solemn
thoughts
moved
me
as
we
drove
on
here
there
had
been
real
war
and
fighting
now
i
saw
a
country
blasted
by
and
wrecked
by
the
contention
of
great
armies
and
i
knew
that
i
was
coming
to
soil
watered
by
british
blood
to
rows
of
british
graves
to
soil
that
shall
be
forever
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
britons
from
britain
and
from
over
the
seas
who
died
and
fought
upon
it
to
redeem
it
from
the
hun
i
had
no
mind
to
talk
to
ask
questions
for
the
time
i
was
content
to
be
with
my
own
thoughts
that
were
evoked
by
the
historic
ground
through
which
we
passed
my
heart
was
heavy
with
grief
and
with
the
memories
of
my
boy
that
came
flooding
it
but
it
was
lightened
too
by
other
thoughts
and
always
as
we
sped
on
there
was
the
thunder
of
the
guns
always
there
were
the
bursting
shells
and
the
old
bent
peasants
paying
no
heed
to
them
always
there
were
the
circling
airplanes
far
above
us
like
hawks
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
and
always
we
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
vimy
ridge
that
deathless
name
in
the
history
of
britain
chapter
xv
now
captain
godfrey
leaned
back
and
smiled
at
us
there
vimy
ridge
he
said
and
he
pointed
yon
i
asked
in
astonishment
i
was
almost
disappointed
we
had
heard
so
much
in
britain
and
in
scotland
of
vimy
ridge
the
name
of
that
famous
hill
had
been
written
imperishably
in
history
but
to
look
at
it
first
to
see
it
as
i
saw
it
it
was
no
hill
at
all
my
eyes
were
used
to
the
mountains
of
my
ain
scotland
and
this
great
ridge
was
but
a
tiny
thing
beside
them
but
then
i
began
to
picture
the
scene
as
it
had
been
the
day
the
canadians
stormed
it
and
won
for
themselves
the
glory
of
all
the
ages
i
pictured
it
blotted
from
sight
by
the
hell
of
shells
bursting
over
it
and
raking
its
slopes
as
the
canadians
charged
upward
i
pictured
it
crowned
by
defenses
and
lined
by
such
of
the
huns
as
had
survived
the
artillery
battering
spitting
death
and
destruction
from
their
machine
guns
and
then
i
saw
it
as
i
should
and
i
breathed
deep
at
the
thought
of
the
men
who
had
faced
death
and
hell
to
win
that
height
and
plant
the
flag
of
britain
upon
it
aye
and
the
stars
and
stripes
of
america
too
ye
ken
that
tale
there
was
an
american
who
had
enlisted
like
so
many
of
his
fellow
countrymen
before
america
was
in
the
war
in
the
canadian
forces
the
british
army
was
full
of
men
who
had
told
a
white
lie
to
don
the
king
uniform
men
there
are
in
the
british
army
who
winked
as
they
enlisted
and
were
told
you
be
a
canadian
aye
aye
i
a
canadian
they
say
from
what
province
the
province
of
kentucky
or
new
york
or
california
well
there
was
a
lad
one
of
them
was
in
the
first
wave
at
vimy
ridge
that
april
day
in
was
but
a
few
days
before
that
a
wave
of
the
wildest
cheering
ever
heard
had
run
along
the
whole
western
front
so
that
fritz
in
his
trenches
wondered
what
was
up
the
noo
well
he
has
learned
since
then
he
has
learned
despite
his
kaiser
and
his
officers
and
his
lying
newspapers
that
that
cheer
went
up
when
the
news
came
that
america
had
declared
war
upon
germany
and
so
it
was
a
few
days
after
that
cheer
was
heard
that
the
canadians
leaped
over
the
top
and
went
for
vimy
ridge
and
this
young
fellow
from
america
had
a
wee
silken
flag
he
spoke
to
his
officer
now
that
my
own
country
in
the
war
sir
he
said
i
like
to
carry
her
flag
with
me
when
we
go
over
the
top
wrapped
around
me
sir
go
it
said
the
officer
and
so
he
did
and
he
was
one
of
those
who
won
through
and
reached
the
top
there
he
was
wounded
but
he
had
carried
the
stars
and
stripes
with
him
to
the
crest
vimy
ridge
i
could
see
it
and
above
it
and
beyond
it
now
for
the
front
had
been
carried
on
far
beyond
within
what
used
to
be
the
lines
of
the
hun
the
airplanes
circled
very
quiet
and
lazy
they
seemed
for
all
i
knew
of
their
endless
activity
and
the
precious
work
that
they
were
doing
i
could
see
how
the
huns
were
shelling
them
you
would
see
an
airplane
hovering
and
then
close
by
suddenly
a
ball
of
cottony
white
smoke
shrapnel
that
was
bursting
as
fritz
tried
to
get
the
range
with
an
gun
an
archie
as
the
tommies
call
them
but
the
plane
would
pay
no
heed
except
maybe
to
dip
a
bit
or
climb
a
little
higher
to
make
it
harder
for
the
hun
it
made
me
think
of
a
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
calmly
and
imperturbably
in
the
face
of
some
great
peril
and
i
wanted
to
cheer
i
had
some
wild
idea
that
maybe
he
would
hear
me
and
know
that
someone
saw
him
and
appreciated
what
he
was
doing
someone
to
whom
it
was
not
an
old
story
but
then
i
smiled
at
my
own
thought
now
it
was
time
for
us
to
leave
the
cars
and
get
some
exercise
our
steel
helmets
were
on
and
glad
we
were
of
them
for
shrapnel
was
bursting
nearby
sometimes
although
most
of
the
shells
were
big
fellows
that
buried
themselves
in
the
ground
and
then
exploded
fritz
was
doing
much
casual
shelling
the
noo
though
he
was
saving
his
fire
until
his
observers
gave
him
a
real
target
to
aim
at
but
that
was
no
so
often
for
our
airplanes
were
in
command
of
the
air
then
and
his
flyers
got
precious
little
chance
to
guide
his
shooting
most
of
his
hits
were
due
to
luck
spread
out
a
bit
as
you
go
along
here
said
captain
godfrey
if
a
crump
lands
close
by
there
no
need
of
all
of
us
going
if
spread
out
a
bit
you
see
a
shell
might
get
one
and
leave
the
rest
of
us
it
sounded
cold
blooded
but
it
was
not
to
men
who
have
lived
at
the
front
everything
comes
to
be
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
men
can
get
used
to
anything
this
war
has
proved
that
again
if
there
was
need
of
proving
it
and
i
came
to
understand
that
and
to
listen
to
things
i
heard
with
different
ears
but
those
are
things
no
one
can
tell
you
of
you
must
have
been
at
the
front
yourself
to
understand
all
that
goes
on
there
both
in
action
and
in
the
minds
of
men
we
obeyed
captain
godfrey
readily
enough
as
you
can
guess
and
so
i
was
alone
as
i
walked
toward
vimy
ridge
it
looked
just
like
a
lumpy
excrescence
on
the
landscape
at
hame
we
would
not
even
think
of
it
as
a
foothill
but
as
i
neared
it
and
as
i
rememered
all
it
stood
for
i
thought
that
in
the
atlas
of
history
it
would
loom
higher
than
the
highest
peak
of
the
great
himalaya
range
beyond
the
ridge
beyond
the
actual
line
of
the
trenches
miles
away
indeed
were
the
german
batteries
from
which
the
shells
we
heard
and
saw
as
they
burst
were
coming
i
was
glad
of
my
helmet
and
of
the
cool
assurance
of
captain
godfrey
i
felt
that
we
were
as
safe
in
his
hands
as
men
could
be
in
such
a
spot
it
was
not
more
than
a
mile
we
had
to
cover
but
it
was
rough
going
bad
going
here
war
had
had
its
grim
way
without
interruption
the
face
of
the
earth
had
been
cut
to
pieces
its
surface
had
been
smashed
to
a
pulpy
mass
the
ground
had
been
plowed
over
and
over
by
a
rain
of
shells
german
and
british
what
a
planting
there
had
been
that
spring
and
what
a
plowing
a
harvest
of
death
it
had
been
that
had
been
sown
and
the
reaper
had
not
waited
for
summer
to
come
and
the
harvest
moon
he
had
passed
that
way
with
his
scythe
and
where
we
passed
now
he
had
taken
his
terrible
his
horrid
toll
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
i
saw
men
fighting
for
the
first
time
actually
fighting
seeking
to
hurt
an
enemy
it
was
a
canadian
battery
we
saw
and
it
was
firing
steadily
and
methodically
at
the
huns
up
to
now
i
had
seen
only
the
vast
industrial
side
of
war
its
business
and
its
labor
now
i
was
for
the
first
time
in
touch
with
actual
fighting
i
saw
the
guns
belching
death
and
destruction
destined
for
men
miles
away
it
was
high
angle
fire
of
course
directed
by
observers
in
the
air
but
even
that
seemed
part
of
the
sheer
industry
of
war
there
was
no
passion
no
coming
to
grips
in
hot
blood
here
orders
were
given
by
the
battery
commander
and
the
other
officers
as
the
foreman
in
a
machine
shop
might
give
them
and
the
busy
artillerymen
worked
like
laborers
too
clearing
their
guns
after
a
salvo
loading
them
bringing
up
fresh
supplies
of
ammunition
it
was
all
methodical
all
a
matter
of
routine
good
artillery
work
is
like
that
said
captain
godfrey
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
it
a
science
it
all
a
matter
of
the
higher
mathematics
everything
is
worked
out
to
half
a
dozen
places
of
decimals
we
eliminated
chance
and
guesswork
just
as
far
as
possible
from
modern
artillery
actions
but
there
was
something
about
it
all
that
was
disappointing
at
first
sight
it
let
you
down
a
bit
only
the
guns
themselves
kept
up
the
tradition
only
they
were
acting
as
they
should
and
showing
a
proper
passion
and
excitement
i
could
hear
them
growling
ominously
like
dogs
locked
in
their
kennel
when
they
would
be
loose
and
about
and
hunting
and
then
they
would
spit
angrily
they
inflamed
my
imagination
did
those
guns
they
satisfied
me
and
my
conception
of
war
and
fighting
more
than
anything
else
that
i
had
seen
had
done
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
after
they
had
spit
out
their
deadly
charge
they
wiped
their
muzzles
with
red
tongues
of
flame
satisfied
beyond
all
words
or
measure
with
what
they
had
done
we
were
rising
now
as
we
walked
and
getting
a
better
view
of
the
country
that
lay
beyond
and
so
i
came
to
understand
a
little
better
the
value
of
a
height
even
so
low
and
insignificant
as
vimy
ridge
in
that
flat
country
while
the
germans
held
it
they
could
overlook
all
our
positions
and
all
the
advantage
of
natural
placing
had
been
to
them
now
thanks
to
the
canadians
it
was
our
turn
and
we
were
looking
down
weel
i
was
under
fire
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
there
was
a
droning
over
us
now
like
the
noise
bees
make
or
many
flies
in
a
small
room
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
was
the
drone
of
the
german
shells
there
was
a
little
freshening
of
the
artillery
activity
on
both
sides
captain
godfrey
said
as
if
in
my
honor
when
one
side
increased
its
fire
the
other
always
answered
played
copy
cat
there
was
no
telling
ye
ken
when
such
an
increase
of
fire
might
not
be
the
first
sign
of
an
attack
and
neither
side
took
more
chances
than
it
must
i
had
known
before
i
left
britain
that
i
would
come
under
fire
and
i
had
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
i
had
expected
to
be
afraid
nervous
brave
men
had
told
me
one
after
another
that
every
man
is
afraid
when
he
first
comes
under
fire
and
so
i
had
wondered
how
i
would
be
and
i
had
expected
to
be
badly
scared
and
extremely
nervous
now
i
could
hear
that
constant
droning
of
shells
and
in
the
distance
i
could
see
very
often
powdery
squirts
of
smoke
and
dirt
along
the
ground
where
our
shells
were
striking
so
that
i
knew
i
had
the
hun
lines
in
sight
and
i
can
truthfully
say
that
that
day
at
least
i
felt
no
great
fear
or
nervousness
later
i
did
as
i
shall
tell
you
but
that
day
one
overpowering
emotion
mastered
every
other
it
was
a
desire
for
vengeance
you
were
the
huns
the
men
who
had
killed
my
boy
they
were
almost
within
my
reach
and
as
i
looked
at
them
there
in
their
lines
a
savage
desire
possessed
me
almost
overwhelmed
me
indeed
that
made
me
want
to
rush
to
those
guns
and
turn
them
to
my
own
mad
purpose
of
vengeance
it
was
all
i
could
do
i
tell
you
to
restrain
myself
to
check
that
wild
almost
ungovernable
impulse
to
rush
to
the
guns
and
grapple
with
them
myself
myself
fire
them
at
the
men
who
had
killed
my
boy
i
wanted
to
fight
i
wanted
to
fight
with
my
two
hands
to
tear
and
rend
and
have
the
consciousness
that
i
flash
back
like
a
telegraph
message
from
my
satiated
hands
to
my
eager
brain
that
was
spurring
me
on
but
that
was
not
to
be
i
knew
it
and
i
grew
calmer
presently
the
roughness
of
the
going
helped
me
to
do
that
for
it
took
all
a
wits
and
faculties
to
grope
his
way
along
the
path
we
were
following
now
indeed
it
was
no
path
at
all
that
led
us
to
the
pimple
the
topmost
point
of
vimy
ridge
which
changed
hands
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
few
minutes
of
bloody
fighting
that
had
gone
on
here
during
the
great
attack
the
ground
was
absolutely
riddled
with
shell
holes
here
there
must
have
been
a
mine
of
metal
underneath
us
what
path
there
was
zigzagged
around
it
had
been
worn
to
such
smoothness
as
it
possessed
since
the
battle
and
it
evaded
the
worst
craters
by
going
around
them
my
madness
was
passed
now
and
a
great
sadness
had
taken
its
place
for
here
where
i
was
walking
men
had
stumbled
up
with
bullets
and
shells
raining
about
them
at
every
step
i
trod
ground
that
must
have
been
the
last
of
some
canadian
soldier
who
had
died
that
i
might
climb
this
ridge
in
a
safety
so
immeasurably
greater
than
his
had
been
if
it
was
hard
for
us
to
make
this
climb
if
we
stumbled
as
we
walked
what
had
it
been
for
them
our
breath
came
hard
and
fast
how
had
it
been
with
them
yet
they
had
done
it
they
had
stormed
the
ridge
the
huns
had
proudly
called
impregnable
they
had
taken
in
a
swift
rush
that
nothing
could
stay
a
position
the
kaiser
generals
had
assured
him
would
never
be
lost
could
never
be
reached
by
mortal
troops
the
pimple
for
which
we
were
heading
now
was
an
observation
post
at
that
time
there
there
was
a
detachment
of
soldiers
for
it
was
an
important
post
covering
much
of
the
hun
territory
beyond
a
major
of
infantry
was
in
command
his
headquarters
were
a
large
hole
in
the
ground
dug
for
him
by
a
german
shell
fired
by
german
gunners
who
had
no
thought
further
from
their
minds
than
to
do
a
favor
for
a
british
officer
and
he
was
sitting
calmly
in
front
of
his
headquarters
smoking
a
pipe
when
we
reached
the
crest
and
came
to
the
pimple
he
was
a
very
calm
man
that
major
given
i
should
say
to
the
greatest
repression
i
think
nothing
would
have
moved
him
from
that
phlegmatic
calm
of
his
he
watched
us
coming
climbing
and
making
hard
going
of
it
if
he
was
amused
he
gave
no
sign
as
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
i
for
one
was
puffing
too
i
was
panting
like
a
grampus
i
had
thought
myself
in
good
condition
but
i
found
out
at
vimy
ridge
that
i
was
soft
and
flabby
not
a
sign
did
that
major
give
until
we
reached
him
and
then
as
we
stood
looking
at
him
and
beyond
him
at
the
panorama
of
the
trenches
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
welcome
to
vimy
ridge
he
said
in
the
manner
of
a
host
greeting
a
party
bidden
for
the
weekend
i
was
determined
that
that
major
should
not
outdo
me
i
had
precious
little
wind
left
to
breathe
with
much
less
to
talk
but
i
called
for
the
last
of
it
thank
you
major
i
said
may
i
join
you
in
a
smoke
of
course
you
can
he
said
unsmiling
that
is
if
you
brought
your
pipe
with
you
aye
i
my
pipe
i
told
him
i
may
forget
to
pay
my
debt
but
i
never
forget
my
pipe
and
no
more
i
will
so
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
drew
out
my
pipe
and
made
a
long
business
of
filling
it
and
pushing
the
tobacco
down
just
so
since
that
gave
me
a
chance
to
get
my
wind
and
when
i
was
ready
to
light
up
i
felt
better
and
i
was
breathing
right
so
that
i
could
talk
as
i
pleased
without
fighting
for
breath
my
friend
the
major
proved
an
entertaining
chap
and
a
talkative
one
too
for
all
his
seeming
brusqueness
he
pointed
out
the
spots
that
had
been
made
famous
in
the
battle
and
explained
to
me
what
it
was
the
canadians
had
done
and
i
saw
and
understood
better
than
ever
before
what
a
great
feat
that
had
been
and
how
heavily
it
had
counted
he
lent
me
his
binoculars
too
and
with
them
i
swept
the
whole
valley
toward
lens
where
the
great
french
coal
mines
are
and
where
the
germans
have
been
under
steady
fire
so
long
and
have
been
hanging
on
by
their
eyelashes
it
was
not
the
place
i
should
choose
ordinarily
to
do
a
bit
of
the
german
shells
were
still
humming
through
the
air
above
us
though
not
quite
so
often
as
they
had
but
there
were
enough
of
them
and
they
seemed
to
me
close
enough
for
me
to
feel
the
wind
they
raised
as
they
passed
i
thought
for
sure
one
of
them
would
come
along
presently
and
clip
my
ears
right
off
and
sometimes
i
felt
myself
ducking
my
head
as
if
that
would
do
me
any
good
but
i
did
not
think
about
it
i
would
feel
myself
doing
it
without
having
intended
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
was
a
bit
nervous
i
suppose
but
no
one
could
be
really
scared
or
alarmed
in
the
unplumbable
depths
of
calm
in
which
that
british
major
was
plunged
it
was
a
grand
view
i
had
of
the
valley
but
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
expected
to
see
i
knew
there
were
thousands
of
men
there
and
i
think
i
had
expected
to
see
men
really
fighting
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
not
a
man
could
i
see
in
all
the
valley
they
were
under
cover
of
course
when
i
stopped
to
think
about
it
that
was
what
i
should
have
expected
of
course
if
i
could
have
seen
our
laddies
there
below
why
the
huns
could
have
seen
them
too
and
that
would
never
have
done
i
could
hear
our
guns
too
now
very
well
they
were
giving
voice
all
around
me
but
never
a
gun
could
i
see
for
all
my
peering
and
searching
around
even
the
battery
we
had
passed
below
was
out
of
sight
now
and
it
was
a
weird
thing
and
an
uncanny
thing
to
think
of
all
that
riot
of
sound
around
and
not
a
sight
to
be
had
of
the
batteries
that
were
making
it
hogge
came
up
while
i
was
talking
to
the
major
hello
he
said
what
have
you
done
to
your
knee
lauder
i
looked
down
and
saw
a
trickle
of
blood
running
down
below
my
knee
it
was
bare
of
course
because
i
wore
my
kilt
oh
that
nothing
i
said
i
knew
at
once
what
it
was
i
remembered
that
as
i
stumbled
up
the
hill
i
had
tripped
over
a
bit
of
barbed
wire
and
scratched
my
leg
and
so
i
explained
and
i
fell
into
a
too
i
said
a
wee
one
as
they
go
around
here
but
i
laughed
still
i
be
able
to
say
i
was
wounded
on
vimy
ridge
i
glanced
at
the
major
as
i
said
that
and
was
half
sorry
i
had
made
the
poor
jest
and
i
saw
him
smile
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
as
i
said
i
had
been
wounded
it
was
the
corner
furthest
from
me
but
i
saw
it
and
it
was
a
dry
smile
a
withered
smile
i
could
guess
his
thought
wounded
he
must
have
said
to
himself
scornfully
and
he
must
have
remembered
the
real
wounds
the
canadians
had
received
on
that
hillside
aye
i
could
guess
his
thought
and
i
shared
it
although
i
did
not
tell
him
so
but
i
think
he
understood
he
was
still
sitting
there
puffing
away
at
his
old
pipe
as
quiet
and
calm
and
imperturbable
as
ever
when
captain
godfrey
gathered
us
together
to
go
on
he
gazed
out
over
the
valley
he
was
a
man
to
be
remembered
for
a
long
time
that
major
i
can
see
him
now
in
my
mind
eye
sitting
there
brooding
staring
out
toward
lens
and
the
german
lines
and
i
think
that
if
i
were
choosing
a
figure
for
some
great
sculptor
to
immortalize
to
typify
and
represent
the
superb
the
majestic
imperturbability
of
the
british
empire
in
time
of
stress
and
storm
his
would
be
the
one
i
could
think
of
no
finer
figure
than
his
for
such
a
statue
you
would
see
him
if
the
sculptor
followed
my
thought
sitting
in
front
of
his
on
vimy
ridge
calm
dispassionate
devoted
to
his
duty
and
the
day
work
quietly
giving
the
directions
that
guided
the
british
guns
in
their
work
of
blasting
the
hun
out
of
the
refuge
he
had
chosen
when
the
canadians
had
driven
him
from
the
spot
where
the
major
sat
it
was
easier
going
down
vimy
ridge
than
it
had
been
coming
up
but
it
was
hard
going
still
we
had
to
skirt
great
gaping
holes
torn
by
monstrous
shells
shells
that
had
torn
the
very
guts
out
of
the
little
hill
we
going
to
visit
another
battery
said
captain
godfrey
tell
you
i
think
it
the
best
hidden
battery
on
the
whole
british
front
and
that
saying
a
good
deal
for
we
learned
a
thing
or
two
about
hiding
our
whereabouts
from
fritz
he
a
curious
one
fritz
is
but
we
try
not
to
gratify
his
curiosity
any
more
than
we
must
i
be
glad
to
see
more
of
the
guns
i
said
well
here
you
see
more
than
guns
the
major
in
command
at
this
battery
we
heading
for
has
a
decoration
that
was
given
to
him
just
for
the
way
he
hid
his
guns
there
much
more
than
fighting
that
a
man
has
to
do
in
this
war
if
he
to
make
good
as
we
went
along
i
kept
my
eyes
open
trying
to
get
a
peep
at
the
guns
before
godfrey
should
point
them
out
to
me
i
could
hear
firing
going
on
all
around
me
but
there
was
so
much
noise
that
my
ears
were
not
a
guide
i
was
not
a
trained
observer
of
course
i
would
not
know
a
gun
position
at
sight
as
some
soldier
trained
to
the
work
would
be
sure
to
do
and
yet
i
thought
i
could
tell
when
i
was
coming
to
a
great
battery
i
thought
so
i
say
again
though
i
had
that
feeling
of
something
weird
and
uncanny
for
now
as
we
walked
along
i
did
hear
the
guns
and
i
was
sure
from
the
nature
of
the
sound
that
we
were
coming
close
to
them
but
as
i
looked
straight
toward
the
spot
where
my
ears
told
me
that
they
must
be
i
could
see
nothing
at
all
i
thought
that
perhaps
godfrey
had
lost
his
way
and
that
we
were
wandering
along
the
wrong
path
it
did
not
seem
likely
but
it
was
possible
and
then
suddenly
when
i
was
least
expecting
it
we
stopped
well
here
we
are
said
the
captain
and
grinned
at
our
amazement
and
there
we
were
indeed
we
were
right
among
the
guns
of
a
canadian
battery
and
the
artillerymen
were
shouting
their
welcome
for
they
had
heard
that
i
was
coming
and
recognized
me
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
but
how
had
we
got
here
i
looked
around
me
in
utter
amazement
even
now
that
i
had
come
to
the
battery
i
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
i
had
been
deceived
how
that
battery
had
been
so
marvelously
concealed
that
if
one
did
not
know
of
its
existence
and
of
its
exact
location
one
might
literally
stumble
over
it
in
broad
daylight
chapter
xvi
it
had
turned
very
hot
now
at
the
full
of
the
day
indeed
it
was
grilling
weather
and
there
in
the
battery
in
a
hollow
close
down
beside
a
little
run
or
stream
it
was
even
hotter
than
on
the
bare
top
of
the
ridge
so
the
canadian
gunners
had
stripped
down
for
comfort
not
a
man
had
more
than
his
on
above
his
trousers
and
many
of
them
were
naked
to
the
waist
with
their
hide
tanned
to
the
color
of
old
saddles
these
laddies
reminded
me
of
those
in
the
first
battery
i
had
seen
they
were
just
as
calm
and
just
as
dispassionate
as
they
worked
in
their
mill
it
might
well
have
been
a
mill
in
which
i
saw
them
working
only
they
were
no
grinding
corn
but
death
death
for
the
huns
who
had
brought
death
to
so
many
of
their
mates
but
there
was
no
excitement
there
were
no
cries
of
hatred
and
anger
they
were
hard
at
work
their
work
it
seemed
never
came
to
an
end
or
even
to
a
pause
the
orders
rang
out
in
a
sort
of
voice
after
each
shot
a
man
who
sat
with
a
telephone
strapped
about
his
head
called
out
corrections
of
the
range
in
figures
that
were
just
a
meaningless
jumble
to
me
although
they
made
sense
to
the
men
who
listened
and
changed
the
pointing
of
the
guns
at
each
order
illustration
capt
john
lauder
and
comrades
before
the
trenches
in
france
see
their
faces
that
like
their
bare
backs
and
chests
looked
like
tanned
leather
were
all
grimy
from
their
work
among
the
smoke
and
the
gases
and
through
the
grime
the
sweat
had
run
down
like
little
rivers
making
courses
for
themselves
in
the
soft
dirt
of
a
hillside
they
looked
grotesque
enough
but
there
was
nothing
about
them
to
make
me
feel
like
laughing
i
can
tell
you
and
they
all
grinned
amiably
when
the
amazed
and
disconcerted
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
came
tumbling
in
among
them
we
all
felt
right
at
hame
at
once
and
i
the
more
so
when
a
chap
i
had
met
and
come
to
know
well
in
toronto
during
one
of
my
american
tours
came
over
and
gripped
my
hand
aye
but
it
good
to
see
your
face
harry
he
said
as
he
made
me
welcome
this
battery
had
done
great
work
ever
since
it
had
come
out
no
battery
in
the
whole
army
had
a
finer
record
i
was
told
and
no
one
needed
to
tell
me
the
tale
of
its
losses
not
far
away
there
was
a
little
cemetery
filled
with
doleful
little
crosses
set
up
over
mounds
that
told
their
grim
story
all
too
plainly
and
too
eloquently
the
battery
had
gone
through
the
battle
of
vimy
ridge
and
made
a
great
name
for
itself
and
now
it
was
set
down
upon
a
spot
that
had
seen
some
of
the
very
bloodiest
of
the
fighting
on
that
day
i
saw
here
for
the
first
time
some
of
the
most
horrible
things
that
the
war
holds
there
was
a
little
stream
as
i
said
that
ran
through
the
hollow
in
which
the
battery
was
placed
and
that
stream
had
been
filled
with
blood
not
water
on
the
day
of
the
battle
everywhere
here
were
whitened
bones
of
men
in
the
wild
swirling
of
the
battle
and
the
confusion
of
digging
in
and
meeting
german
counter
attacks
that
had
followed
it
it
had
not
been
possible
to
bury
all
the
dead
and
so
the
whitened
bones
remained
though
the
elements
had
long
since
stripped
them
bare
the
elements
and
the
hungry
rats
these
are
not
pretty
things
to
tell
but
they
are
true
and
the
world
should
know
what
war
is
i
almost
trod
upon
one
skeleton
that
remained
complete
it
was
that
of
a
huge
german
soldier
a
veritable
giant
of
a
man
he
must
have
been
the
bones
of
his
feet
were
still
encased
in
his
great
boots
their
soles
heavily
studded
with
nails
even
a
few
shreds
of
his
uniform
remained
but
the
flesh
was
all
gone
the
sun
and
the
rats
and
the
birds
had
accounted
for
the
last
morsel
of
it
hundreds
of
years
from
now
i
suppose
the
bones
that
were
strewn
along
that
ground
will
still
be
being
turned
up
by
plows
the
generations
to
come
who
live
there
will
never
lack
relics
of
the
battle
and
of
the
fighting
that
preceded
and
followed
it
they
will
find
bones
and
shell
cases
and
bits
of
metal
of
all
sorts
rusty
bayonets
will
be
turned
up
by
their
plowshares
strange
coins
as
puzzling
as
some
of
those
of
roman
times
that
we
in
britain
have
found
will
puzzle
them
who
can
tell
how
long
it
will
be
before
the
soil
about
vimy
ridge
will
cease
to
give
up
its
relics
that
ground
had
been
searched
carefully
for
everything
that
might
conceivably
be
put
to
use
again
or
be
made
fit
for
further
service
the
british
army
searches
every
battlefield
so
in
these
days
and
yet
when
i
was
there
many
weeks
after
the
storm
of
fighting
had
passed
on
and
when
the
scavengers
had
done
their
work
the
ground
was
still
rather
thickly
strewn
with
odds
and
ends
that
interested
me
vastly
i
might
have
picked
up
much
more
than
i
did
but
i
could
not
carry
so
very
much
and
too
so
many
of
the
things
brought
grisly
thoughts
to
my
mind
god
knows
i
needed
no
reminders
of
the
war
i
had
a
reminder
in
my
heart
that
never
left
me
still
i
took
some
few
things
more
for
the
sake
of
the
hame
folks
who
might
not
see
and
would
surely
be
interested
i
gathered
some
bayonets
for
my
collection
somehow
they
seemed
the
things
i
was
most
willing
to
take
along
one
was
british
one
german
two
were
french
but
the
best
souvenir
of
all
i
got
at
vimy
ridge
i
did
not
pick
up
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
friend
the
grave
major
him
of
whom
i
would
like
some
famous
sculptor
to
make
a
statue
as
he
sat
at
his
work
of
observation
that
was
a
club
a
wicked
looking
instrument
this
club
had
a
great
thick
head
huge
in
proportion
to
its
length
and
size
and
this
head
was
studded
with
great
sharp
nails
a
single
blow
from
it
would
finish
the
strongest
man
that
ever
lived
it
was
a
fit
weapon
for
a
murderer
and
a
murderer
had
wielded
it
the
major
had
taken
it
from
a
hun
who
had
meant
to
use
it
had
doubtless
used
it
to
beat
out
the
brains
of
wounded
men
lying
on
the
ground
many
of
those
clubs
were
taken
from
the
germans
all
along
the
front
both
by
the
british
and
the
french
and
the
germans
had
never
made
any
secret
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
intended
well
they
picked
poor
men
to
try
such
tactics
on
when
they
went
against
the
canadians
the
canadians
started
no
such
work
but
they
were
quick
to
adopt
a
policy
of
give
and
take
it
was
the
canadians
who
began
the
trench
raids
for
which
the
germans
have
such
a
fierce
distaste
and
after
they
had
learned
something
of
how
fritz
fought
the
canadians
took
to
paying
him
back
in
some
of
his
own
coin
not
that
they
matched
the
deeds
of
the
huns
only
a
hun
could
do
that
but
the
canadians
were
not
eager
to
take
prisoners
they
would
bomb
a
dugout
rather
than
take
its
occupants
back
and
a
dugout
that
has
been
bombed
yields
few
living
men
who
shall
blame
them
not
i
nor
any
other
man
who
knows
what
lessons
in
brutality
and
treachery
the
canadians
have
had
from
the
hun
it
was
the
canadians
near
ypres
who
went
through
the
first
gas
attack
that
fearful
day
when
the
germans
were
closer
to
breaking
through
than
they
ever
were
before
or
since
i
shall
not
set
down
here
all
the
tales
i
heard
of
the
atrocities
of
the
huns
others
have
done
that
men
have
written
of
that
who
have
firsthand
knowledge
as
mine
can
not
be
i
know
only
what
has
been
told
to
me
and
there
is
little
need
of
hearsay
evidence
there
is
evidence
enough
that
any
court
would
accept
as
hanging
proof
but
this
much
it
is
right
to
say
that
no
troops
along
the
western
front
have
more
to
revenge
than
have
the
canadians
it
is
not
the
loss
of
comrades
dearly
loved
though
they
be
that
breeds
hatred
among
the
soldiers
that
is
a
part
of
war
and
always
was
the
loss
of
friends
and
comrades
may
fire
the
blood
it
may
lead
men
to
risk
their
own
lives
in
a
desperate
charge
to
get
even
but
it
is
a
pain
that
does
not
rankle
and
that
does
not
fester
like
a
sore
that
will
not
heal
it
is
the
tales
the
canadians
have
to
tell
of
sheer
depraved
torture
and
brutality
that
has
inflamed
them
to
the
pitch
of
hatred
that
they
cherish
it
has
seemed
as
if
the
germans
had
a
particular
grudge
against
the
canadians
and
that
indeed
is
known
to
be
the
case
the
germans
harbored
many
a
fond
illusion
before
the
war
they
thought
that
britain
would
not
fight
first
of
all
and
then
when
britain
did
declare
war
they
thought
they
could
speedily
destroy
her
contemptible
little
army
ah
weel
they
did
come
near
to
destroying
it
but
not
until
it
had
helped
to
balk
them
of
their
desire
not
until
it
had
played
its
great
and
decisive
part
in
ruining
the
plans
the
hun
had
been
making
and
perfecting
for
long
years
and
not
until
it
had
served
as
a
dyke
behind
which
floods
of
men
in
the
khaki
of
king
george
had
had
time
to
arm
and
drill
to
rush
out
to
oppose
the
floods
that
had
swept
through
helpless
belgium
they
had
other
illusions
beside
that
major
one
that
helped
to
wreck
them
they
thought
there
would
be
a
rebellion
and
civil
war
in
ireland
they
took
too
seriously
the
troubles
of
the
early
summer
of
when
ulster
and
the
south
of
ireland
were
snapping
and
snarling
at
each
other
throats
they
looked
for
a
new
mutiny
in
india
which
should
keep
britain
hands
full
they
expected
strikes
at
home
but
above
all
they
were
sure
that
the
great
dependencies
of
britain
that
made
up
the
mighty
british
empire
would
take
no
part
in
the
fight
canada
australasia
south
africa
they
never
reckoned
upon
having
to
cope
with
them
these
were
separate
nations
they
thought
independent
in
fact
if
not
in
name
which
would
seize
the
occasion
to
separate
themselves
entirely
from
the
mother
country
in
south
africa
they
were
sure
that
there
would
be
smoldering
discontent
enough
left
from
the
days
of
the
boer
war
to
break
out
into
a
new
flame
of
war
and
rebellion
at
this
great
chance
and
so
it
drove
them
mad
with
fury
when
they
learned
that
canada
and
all
the
rest
had
gone
in
heart
and
soul
and
when
even
their
poison
gas
could
not
make
the
canadians
yield
when
later
still
they
learned
that
the
canadians
were
their
match
and
more
than
their
match
in
every
phase
of
the
great
game
of
war
their
rage
led
them
to
excesses
against
the
men
from
overseas
even
more
damnable
than
those
that
were
their
general
practice
these
canadians
who
were
now
my
hosts
had
located
their
guns
in
a
pit
triangular
in
shape
the
guns
were
mounted
at
the
corners
of
the
triangle
and
along
its
sides
and
constantly
while
i
was
there
they
coughed
their
short
sharp
coughs
and
sent
a
spume
of
metal
flying
toward
the
german
lines
never
have
i
seen
a
busier
spot
and
remember
until
i
had
almost
fallen
into
that
pit
with
its
sputtering
busy
guns
i
had
not
been
able
to
make
even
a
good
guess
as
to
where
they
were
the
very
presence
of
this
workshop
of
death
was
hidden
from
all
save
those
who
had
a
right
to
know
of
it
it
was
a
masterly
piece
of
camouflage
i
wish
i
could
explain
to
you
how
the
effect
was
achieved
it
was
all
made
plain
to
me
every
step
of
the
process
was
explained
and
i
cried
out
in
wonder
and
in
admiration
at
the
clever
simplicity
of
it
but
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
may
not
tell
i
saw
many
things
during
my
time
at
the
front
that
the
germans
would
give
a
pretty
penny
to
know
but
none
of
the
secrets
that
i
learned
would
be
more
valuable
even
than
that
of
that
hidden
battery
and
so
i
must
leave
you
in
ignorance
as
to
that
the
commanding
officer
was
most
kindly
and
patient
in
explaining
matters
to
me
we
ca
see
hide
nor
hair
of
our
targets
here
of
course
he
said
any
more
than
fritz
can
see
us
we
get
all
our
ranges
and
the
records
of
all
our
hits
from
normabell
i
looked
a
question
i
suppose
you
called
on
him
i
think
up
on
the
pimple
major
normabell
that
was
how
i
learned
the
name
of
the
imperturbable
major
with
whom
i
had
smoked
a
pipe
on
the
crest
of
vimy
ridge
i
shall
always
remember
his
name
and
him
i
saw
no
man
in
france
who
made
a
livelier
impression
upon
my
mind
and
my
imagination
aye
i
said
i
remember
so
that
his
name
normabell
i
make
a
note
of
that
my
informant
smiled
normabell
one
of
our
characters
he
said
well
you
see
he
commands
a
goodish
bit
of
country
there
where
he
sits
and
when
he
needs
them
he
has
aircraft
observations
to
help
him
too
he
our
pair
of
eyes
we
like
moles
down
here
we
gunners
but
he
does
all
our
seeing
for
us
and
he
in
constant
communication
he
or
one
of
his
officers
i
wondered
where
all
the
shells
the
battery
was
firing
were
headed
for
and
i
learned
that
just
then
it
was
paying
its
respects
particularly
to
a
big
factory
building
just
west
of
lens
for
some
reason
that
had
been
marked
for
destruction
but
it
had
been
reinforced
and
strengthened
so
that
it
was
taking
a
lot
of
smashing
and
standing
a
good
deal
more
punishment
than
anyone
had
thought
it
could
which
was
reason
enough
in
itself
to
stick
to
the
job
until
that
factory
was
nothing
more
than
a
heap
of
dust
and
ruins
the
way
the
guns
kept
pounding
away
at
it
made
me
think
of
firemen
in
a
small
town
drenching
a
local
blaze
with
their
hose
the
gunners
were
just
so
eager
as
that
and
i
could
almost
see
that
factory
crumbling
away
major
normabell
had
pointed
it
out
to
me
up
on
the
ridge
and
now
i
knew
why
i
venture
to
say
that
before
night
the
howitzers
of
that
battery
had
utterly
demolished
it
and
so
ended
whatever
usefulness
it
had
had
for
the
germans
it
was
cruel
business
to
be
knocking
the
towns
and
factories
of
our
ally
france
to
bits
in
the
fashion
that
we
were
doing
that
day
there
and
at
many
another
point
along
the
front
the
huns
are
fond
of
saying
that
much
of
the
destruction
in
northern
france
has
been
the
work
of
allied
artillery
true
enough
but
who
made
that
inevitable
and
it
was
not
our
guns
that
laid
waste
a
whole
countryside
before
the
german
retreat
in
the
spring
of
when
the
huns
ran
wild
rooting
up
fruit
trees
cutting
down
every
other
tree
that
could
be
found
and
doing
every
other
sort
of
wanton
damage
and
mischief
their
hands
could
find
to
do
hard
lines
said
the
battery
commander
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
use
trying
to
spare
shells
here
though
even
on
french
towns
the
harder
we
smash
them
the
sooner
it
be
over
look
here
sir
he
pointed
out
the
men
who
sat
their
telephone
receivers
strapped
over
their
ears
each
served
a
gun
in
all
that
hideous
din
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
they
should
hear
correctly
every
word
and
figure
that
came
to
them
over
the
wire
a
part
of
that
marvelously
complete
telephone
and
telegraph
system
that
has
been
built
for
and
by
the
british
army
in
france
they
get
corrections
on
every
shot
he
told
me
the
guns
are
altered
in
elevation
according
to
what
they
hear
the
range
is
changed
and
the
pointing
too
we
never
see
old
fritz
but
we
know
he
getting
the
visiting
cards
we
send
him
they
were
amazingly
calm
those
laddies
at
the
telephones
in
all
that
hideous
din
they
never
grew
excited
their
voices
were
calm
and
steady
as
they
repeated
the
orders
that
came
to
them
i
have
seen
girls
at
hotel
switchboards
expert
operators
working
with
conditions
made
to
their
order
who
grew
infinitely
more
excited
at
a
busy
time
when
many
calls
were
coming
in
and
going
out
those
men
might
have
been
at
home
talking
to
a
friend
of
their
plans
for
an
evening
diversion
for
all
the
nervousness
or
fussiness
they
showed
up
there
on
the
pimple
i
had
seen
normabell
the
eyes
of
the
battery
here
i
was
watching
its
ears
and
to
finish
the
metaphor
to
work
it
out
i
was
listening
to
its
voice
its
brazen
tongues
were
giving
voice
continually
the
guns
after
all
everything
else
led
up
to
them
they
were
the
reason
for
all
the
rest
of
the
machinery
of
the
battery
and
it
was
they
who
said
the
last
short
word
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rough
joking
and
laughter
in
the
battery
the
canadian
gunners
took
their
task
lightly
enough
though
their
work
was
of
the
hardest
and
of
the
most
dangerous
too
but
jokes
ran
from
group
to
group
from
gun
to
gun
they
were
constantly
kidding
one
another
as
an
american
would
say
i
think
if
a
correction
came
for
one
gun
that
showed
there
had
been
a
mistake
in
sighting
after
the
last
orders
if
that
is
the
gunners
and
not
the
distant
observers
were
plainly
at
fault
there
would
be
a
outburst
of
chaffing
from
all
the
others
but
though
such
a
spirit
of
lightness
prevailed
there
was
not
a
moment
of
loafing
these
men
were
engaged
in
a
grim
deadly
task
and
every
once
in
a
while
i
would
catch
a
black
purposeful
look
in
a
man
eyes
that
made
me
realize
that
under
all
the
light
talk
and
laughter
there
was
a
perfect
realization
of
the
truth
they
might
not
show
on
the
surface
that
they
took
life
and
their
work
seriously
ah
no
they
preferred
after
the
custom
of
their
race
to
joke
with
death
and
so
they
were
doing
quite
literally
the
germans
knew
perfectly
well
that
there
was
a
battery
somewhere
near
the
spot
where
i
had
found
my
gunners
only
the
exact
location
was
hidden
from
them
and
they
never
ceased
their
efforts
to
determine
that
fritz
airplanes
were
always
trying
to
sneak
over
to
get
a
look
an
airplane
was
the
only
means
of
detection
the
canadians
feared
no
i
will
not
say
they
feared
it
the
word
fear
did
not
exist
for
that
battery
but
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
there
was
a
tolerable
chance
even
for
fritz
to
locate
them
and
for
the
sake
of
the
whole
operation
at
that
point
as
well
as
for
their
own
interest
they
were
eager
to
avoid
that
german
airplanes
were
always
trying
to
sneak
over
i
say
but
nearly
always
our
men
of
the
royal
flying
corps
drove
them
back
we
came
as
close
just
then
to
having
command
of
the
air
in
that
sector
as
any
army
does
these
days
you
can
not
quite
command
or
control
the
air
a
few
hostile
flyers
can
get
through
the
heaviest
barrage
and
the
staunchest
air
patrol
and
so
every
once
in
a
while
an
alarm
would
sound
and
all
hands
would
crane
their
necks
upward
to
watch
an
airplane
flying
above
with
an
iron
cross
painted
upon
its
wings
then
and
as
a
rule
then
only
fire
would
cease
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
far
less
chance
of
detection
when
the
guns
were
still
at
the
height
at
which
our
archies
so
the
guns
are
called
by
tommy
atkins
forced
the
boche
to
fly
there
was
little
chance
of
his
observers
picking
out
this
battery
at
least
against
the
ground
if
the
guns
were
giving
voice
that
chance
was
tripled
and
so
they
stopped
at
such
times
until
a
british
flyer
had
had
time
to
engage
the
hun
and
either
bring
him
down
or
send
him
scurrying
for
the
safe
shelter
behind
his
own
lines
fritz
in
the
air
liked
to
have
the
odds
with
him
as
a
rule
it
was
exceptional
to
find
a
german
flyer
like
boelke
who
really
went
in
for
duels
in
the
air
as
a
rule
they
preferred
to
attack
a
single
plane
with
half
a
dozen
and
so
make
as
sure
as
they
could
of
victory
at
a
minimum
of
risk
but
that
policy
did
not
always
work
sometimes
the
lone
british
flyer
came
out
ahead
despite
the
odds
against
him
there
was
a
good
deal
of
firing
on
general
principles
from
fritz
his
shells
came
wandering
querulously
about
striking
on
every
side
of
the
battery
occasionally
of
course
there
was
a
hit
that
was
direct
or
nearly
so
and
then
as
a
rule
a
new
mound
or
two
would
appear
in
the
little
cemetery
and
a
new
set
of
crosses
that
for
a
few
days
you
might
easily
enough
have
marked
for
new
because
they
would
not
be
weathered
yet
but
such
hits
were
few
and
far
between
and
they
were
lucky
casual
shots
of
which
the
germans
themselves
did
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
of
course
if
they
get
our
range
really
and
find
out
all
about
us
we
have
to
move
said
the
officer
in
command
that
would
be
a
bore
but
it
could
be
helped
we
a
fixed
target
you
see
as
soon
as
they
know
just
where
we
are
and
they
can
turn
loose
a
battery
of
heavy
howitzers
against
us
and
clear
us
out
of
here
in
no
time
but
we
pretty
quick
movers
when
we
have
to
move
it
great
sport
in
a
way
too
sometimes
we
leave
all
the
camouflage
behind
and
fritz
will
spend
a
week
shelling
a
position
that
was
moved
away
at
the
first
shell
that
came
as
if
it
meant
they
really
were
on
to
us
i
wondered
how
a
battery
commander
would
determine
the
difference
between
a
casual
hit
and
the
first
shell
of
a
bombardment
definitely
planned
and
accurately
placed
you
can
tell
as
a
rule
if
you
know
the
game
he
said
be
searching
shells
you
see
there
be
one
too
far
perhaps
and
then
after
a
pretty
exact
interval
there
be
another
maybe
a
bit
short
then
one
to
the
left
and
then
to
the
right
by
that
time
we
off
as
a
rule
we
do
wait
for
the
one
that
will
be
scored
a
hit
if
you
quick
you
see
you
can
beat
fritz
to
it
by
keeping
your
eyes
open
and
being
ready
to
move
in
a
hurry
when
he
got
a
really
good
argument
to
make
you
do
it
but
while
i
was
there
while
fritz
was
inquisitive
enough
his
curiosity
got
him
nowhere
there
were
no
casual
hits
even
and
there
was
nothing
to
make
the
battery
feel
that
it
must
be
making
ready
for
a
quick
trek
was
that
no
a
weird
strange
game
of
hide
and
seek
that
i
watched
being
played
at
vimy
ridge
it
gave
me
the
creeps
that
idea
of
battling
with
an
enemy
you
could
not
see
it
must
be
hard
at
times
i
think
for
the
gunners
to
realize
that
they
are
actually
at
war
but
no
there
is
always
the
drone
and
the
squawking
of
the
german
shells
and
the
from
time
to
time
as
one
finds
its
mark
in
the
mud
nearby
but
to
think
of
shooting
always
at
an
enemy
you
can
not
see
it
brought
to
my
mind
a
tale
i
had
heard
at
hame
in
scotland
there
was
a
hospital
in
glasgow
and
there
a
man
who
had
gone
to
see
a
friend
stopped
suddenly
in
amazement
at
the
side
of
a
cot
he
looked
down
at
features
that
were
familiar
to
him
the
man
in
the
cot
was
not
looking
at
him
and
the
visitor
stood
gaping
staring
at
him
in
the
utmost
astonishment
and
doubt
i
say
man
he
asked
at
last
are
ye
not
tamson
the
baker
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
weakly
aye
he
said
i
tamson
the
baker
his
voice
was
weak
and
he
looked
tired
but
he
looked
puzzled
too
weel
tamson
man
what
the
matter
wi
ye
asked
the
other
i
didna
hear
that
ye
were
sick
or
hurt
how
comes
it
ye
are
here
can
it
be
that
ye
ha
been
to
the
war
man
and
we
not
hearing
of
it
at
all
aye
i
think
so
said
tamson
still
weakly
but
as
if
he
were
rather
glad
of
a
chance
to
talk
at
that
ye
think
so
asked
his
friend
in
greater
astonishment
than
ever
man
if
ye
been
to
the
war
do
ye
not
know
it
for
sure
and
certain
well
i
will
tell
ye
how
it
is
said
tamson
very
slowly
and
wearily
i
was
in
the
reserve
do
ye
ken
and
i
was
standin
in
front
of
my
hoose
one
day
in
august
thinkin
of
nothin
at
all
i
marked
a
man
who
was
coming
doon
the
street
wi
a
blue
paper
in
his
hand
and
studyin
the
numbers
on
the
doorplates
but
i
paid
no
great
heed
to
him
until
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
me
he
had
stopped
outside
my
hoose
and
looked
at
the
number
and
then
at
his
blue
paper
and
then
he
turned
to
me
ye
tamson
the
baker
he
asked
me
just
as
ye
asked
me
that
same
question
the
noo
and
i
said
to
him
just
as
i
said
it
to
ye
i
tamson
the
baker
it
hamilton
barracks
for
ye
tamson
he
said
and
handed
me
the
blue
paper
four
hours
from
the
time
when
he
handed
me
the
blue
paper
in
front
of
my
hoose
in
glasgow
i
was
at
hamilton
barracks
in
twelve
hours
i
was
in
southhampton
in
twenty
hours
i
was
in
france
and
aboot
as
soon
as
i
got
there
i
was
in
a
lot
of
shooting
and
running
this
way
and
that
that
they
ha
told
me
since
was
the
battle
of
the
marne
and
in
hours
more
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
glasgow
in
hours
i
woke
up
in
stobe
hill
infirmary
and
the
nurse
was
saying
in
my
ear
all
richt
the
noon
tamson
we
ha
only
just
amputated
your
leg
so
i
think
i
ha
been
to
the
war
but
i
can
only
say
i
think
so
i
only
know
what
i
was
told
that
ha
never
seen
a
damn
german
yet
that
is
a
true
story
of
tamson
the
baker
and
his
experience
has
actually
been
shared
by
many
a
poor
fellow
and
by
many
another
who
might
have
counted
himself
lucky
if
he
had
lost
no
more
than
a
leg
as
tamson
did
but
the
laddies
of
my
battery
though
they
were
shooting
now
at
germans
they
could
not
see
had
had
many
a
close
up
view
of
fritz
in
the
past
and
expected
many
another
in
the
future
maybe
they
will
get
one
some
time
after
the
fashion
of
the
company
of
which
my
boy
john
once
told
me
the
captain
of
this
company
a
hieland
company
it
was
though
not
of
john
regiment
had
spent
must
of
his
time
in
london
before
the
war
and
belonged
to
several
clubs
which
in
those
days
employed
many
germans
as
servants
and
waiters
he
was
a
big
man
and
he
had
a
deep
bass
voice
so
that
he
roared
like
the
bull
of
bashan
when
he
had
a
mind
to
raise
it
for
all
to
hear
one
day
things
were
dull
in
his
sector
the
front
line
trench
was
not
far
from
that
of
the
germans
but
there
was
no
activity
beyond
that
of
the
snipers
and
the
germans
were
being
so
cautious
that
ours
were
getting
mighty
few
shots
the
captain
was
bored
and
so
were
the
men
how
would
you
like
a
pot
shot
lads
he
asked
fine
came
the
answer
fine
sir
very
well
said
the
captain
get
ready
with
your
rifles
and
keep
your
eyes
on
you
trench
it
was
not
more
than
thirty
yards
away
pointblank
range
the
captain
waited
until
they
were
ready
and
then
his
voice
rang
out
in
its
loudest
most
commanding
roar
waiter
he
shouted
forty
helmets
popped
up
over
the
german
parapet
and
a
storm
of
bullets
swept
them
away
chapter
xvii
it
was
getting
late
for
men
who
had
had
so
early
a
breakfast
as
we
had
had
to
make
to
get
started
in
good
time
and
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
hungry
odd
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
a
thing
as
lunch
should
stay
in
my
mind
in
such
surroundings
and
when
so
many
vastly
more
important
things
were
afoot
the
major
looked
at
his
wrist
watch
by
jove
he
said
lunch
time
gentlemen
you
accept
such
hospitality
as
we
can
offer
you
at
our
officer
mess
there
was
any
question
about
acceptance
we
all
said
we
were
delighted
and
we
meant
it
i
looked
around
for
a
hut
or
some
such
place
or
even
for
a
tent
and
seeing
nothing
of
the
sort
wondered
where
we
might
be
going
to
eat
i
soon
found
out
the
major
led
the
way
underground
into
a
dugout
this
was
the
mess
it
was
hard
by
the
guns
and
in
a
hole
that
had
been
dug
out
quit
literally
here
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
safety
in
these
dugouts
every
phase
of
the
battery
life
except
the
actual
serving
of
the
guns
went
on
officers
and
men
alike
ate
and
slept
in
them
they
were
much
snugger
within
than
you
might
fancy
a
lot
of
the
men
had
given
homelike
touches
to
their
habitations
pictures
cut
from
the
illustrated
papers
at
home
which
are
such
prime
favorites
with
all
the
tommies
made
up
a
large
part
of
the
decorative
scheme
pictures
of
actresses
predominated
the
tommies
did
go
in
for
war
pictures
indeed
there
is
little
disposition
to
hammer
the
war
home
at
you
in
a
dugout
the
men
do
talk
about
it
or
think
about
save
as
they
must
you
hear
less
talk
about
the
war
along
the
front
than
you
do
at
home
i
heard
a
story
at
vimy
ridge
of
a
tommy
who
had
come
back
to
the
trenches
after
seeing
blighty
for
the
first
time
in
months
hello
bill
said
one
of
his
mates
back
again
are
you
things
in
blighty
oh
all
right
said
bill
then
he
looked
around
he
pricked
his
ears
as
a
shell
whined
above
him
and
he
took
out
his
pipe
and
stuffed
it
full
of
tobacco
and
lighted
it
and
sat
back
he
sighed
in
the
deepest
content
as
the
smoke
began
to
curl
upward
bill
i
say
to
look
at
you
you
was
glad
to
be
back
here
said
his
mate
astonished
well
i
ai
so
sorry
and
that
a
fact
said
bill
i
tell
you
how
it
is
alf
back
there
in
blighty
they
do
talk
about
nothing
but
this
bloody
war
i
fair
fed
up
with
it
that
i
am
i
glad
to
be
back
here
where
i
do
have
to
about
the
war
every
minute
that
story
sounds
far
fetched
to
you
perhaps
but
it
is
war
talk
is
shop
talk
to
the
men
who
are
fighting
it
and
winning
it
and
it
is
perfectly
true
and
perfectly
reasonable
too
that
they
like
to
get
away
from
it
when
they
can
just
as
any
man
likes
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
his
business
or
his
work
when
he
is
at
the
office
or
the
factory
or
the
shop
captain
godfrey
explained
to
me
as
we
went
into
the
mess
hall
for
lunch
that
the
dugouts
were
really
pretty
safe
of
course
there
were
dangers
where
are
there
not
along
that
strip
of
land
that
runs
from
the
north
sea
to
switzerland
in
france
and
belgium
a
direct
hit
from
a
big
enough
shell
would
bury
us
all
he
said
but
that
not
likely
the
chances
are
all
against
it
and
even
then
we
have
a
chance
i
seen
men
dug
out
alive
from
a
hole
like
this
after
a
shell
from
one
of
their
biggest
howitzers
had
landed
square
upon
it
but
i
had
no
anxiety
to
form
part
of
an
experiment
to
prove
the
truth
or
the
falsity
of
that
suggestion
i
was
glad
to
know
that
the
chances
of
a
shell
coming
along
were
pretty
slim
conditions
were
primitive
at
that
mess
the
refinements
of
life
were
lacking
to
be
sure
but
who
cared
certainly
the
hungry
members
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
did
not
we
ate
from
a
rough
deal
table
sitting
on
rude
benches
that
had
a
decidedly
look
but
we
had
music
with
our
meals
just
like
the
folks
in
london
at
the
savoy
or
in
new
york
at
sherry
it
was
the
incessant
thunder
of
the
guns
that
served
as
the
musical
accompaniment
of
our
lunch
and
i
was
already
growing
to
love
that
music
i
could
begin
now
to
distinguish
degrees
of
sound
and
modulations
of
all
sorts
in
the
mighty
diapason
of
the
cannon
it
was
as
if
a
conductor
were
leading
an
orchestra
and
as
if
it
responded
instantly
to
every
suggestion
of
his
baton
there
was
not
much
variety
to
the
food
but
there
was
plenty
of
it
and
it
was
good
there
was
bully
beef
of
course
that
is
the
real
staff
of
life
for
the
british
army
and
there
were
potatoes
in
plentiful
supply
and
bread
and
butter
and
tea
there
is
always
tea
where
tommy
or
his
officers
are
about
there
was
a
lack
of
table
ware
a
dainty
soul
might
not
have
liked
the
thought
of
spreading
his
butter
on
his
bread
with
his
thumb
as
we
had
to
do
but
i
was
too
hungry
to
be
fastidious
myself
because
the
mess
had
guests
there
was
a
special
dish
in
our
honor
one
of
the
men
had
gone
over
at
considerable
risk
of
his
life
as
i
learned
later
to
the
heap
of
stones
and
dust
that
had
once
been
the
village
of
givenchy
there
he
had
found
a
lot
of
gooseberries
the
french
call
them
grossets
as
we
in
scotland
do
too
although
the
pronunciation
of
the
word
is
different
in
the
two
languages
of
course
there
had
been
gardens
around
the
houses
of
givenchy
once
before
the
place
had
been
made
into
a
desert
of
rubble
and
brickdust
and
somehow
life
had
survived
in
those
bruised
and
battered
gardens
and
the
delicious
mess
of
gooseberries
that
we
had
for
dessert
stood
as
proof
thereof
the
meal
was
seasoned
by
good
talk
i
love
to
hear
the
young
british
officers
talk
it
is
a
liberal
education
they
have
grown
so
wise
those
boys
those
of
them
who
come
back
when
the
war
is
over
will
have
the
world
at
their
feet
indeed
nothing
will
be
able
to
stop
them
or
to
check
them
in
their
rise
they
have
learned
every
great
lesson
that
a
man
must
learn
if
he
is
to
succeed
in
the
affairs
of
life
self
control
is
theirs
and
an
infinite
patience
and
a
dogged
determination
that
refuses
to
admit
that
there
are
any
things
that
a
man
can
not
do
if
he
only
makes
up
his
mind
that
he
must
and
will
do
them
for
the
british
army
has
accomplished
the
impossible
time
after
time
it
has
done
things
that
men
knew
could
not
be
done
and
so
we
sat
and
talked
as
we
smoked
after
the
meal
until
the
major
rose
at
last
and
invited
me
to
walk
around
the
battery
again
with
him
i
could
ask
questions
now
having
seen
the
men
at
work
and
he
explained
many
things
i
wanted
to
know
and
which
fritz
would
like
to
know
too
to
this
day
but
above
all
i
was
fascinated
by
the
work
of
the
gunners
i
kept
trying
in
my
mind
eye
to
follow
the
course
of
the
shells
that
were
dispatched
so
calmly
upon
their
errands
of
destruction
my
imagination
played
with
the
thought
of
what
they
were
doing
at
the
other
end
of
their
swift
voyage
through
the
air
i
pictured
the
havoc
that
must
be
wrought
when
one
made
a
clean
hit
and
suddenly
i
was
swept
by
that
same
almost
irresistible
desire
to
be
fighting
myself
that
had
come
over
me
when
i
had
seen
the
other
battery
if
i
could
only
play
my
part
if
i
could
fire
even
a
single
shot
if
i
with
my
own
hands
could
do
that
much
against
those
who
had
killed
my
boy
and
then
incredulously
i
heard
the
words
in
my
ear
it
was
the
major
would
you
like
to
try
a
shot
harry
he
asked
me
would
i
i
stared
at
him
i
could
believe
my
ears
it
was
as
if
he
had
read
my
thoughts
i
gasped
out
some
sort
of
an
affirmative
my
blood
was
boiling
at
the
very
thought
and
the
sweat
started
from
my
pores
all
right
nothing
easier
said
the
major
smiling
i
had
an
idea
you
were
wanting
to
take
a
hand
harry
he
led
me
toward
one
of
the
guns
where
the
sweating
crew
was
especially
active
as
it
seemed
to
me
they
grinned
at
me
as
they
saw
me
coming
here
old
harry
lauder
come
to
take
a
crack
at
them
himself
i
heard
one
man
say
to
another
good
for
him
the
more
the
merrier
answered
his
mate
he
was
an
american
would
ye
no
know
it
from
his
speech
i
was
trembling
with
eagerness
i
wondered
if
my
shot
would
tell
i
tried
to
visualize
its
consequences
it
might
strike
some
vital
spot
it
might
kill
some
man
whose
life
was
of
the
utmost
value
to
the
enemy
it
might
it
might
do
anything
and
i
knew
that
my
shot
would
be
watched
normabell
sitting
up
there
on
the
pimple
in
his
little
observatory
would
watch
it
as
he
did
all
of
that
battery
shots
would
be
make
a
report
everything
was
made
ready
the
gun
recoiled
from
the
previous
shot
swiftly
it
was
swabbed
out
a
new
shell
was
handed
up
i
looked
it
over
tenderly
that
was
my
shell
i
watched
the
men
as
they
placed
it
and
saw
it
disappear
with
a
jerk
then
came
the
swift
sighting
of
the
gun
the
almost
inperceptible
corrections
of
elevation
and
position
they
showed
me
my
place
after
all
it
was
the
simplest
of
matters
to
fire
even
the
biggest
of
guns
i
had
but
to
pull
a
lever
all
morning
i
had
been
watching
men
do
that
i
knew
it
was
but
a
perfunctory
act
but
i
could
not
feel
that
i
was
thrilled
and
excited
as
i
had
never
been
in
all
my
life
before
all
ready
fire
the
order
rang
in
my
ears
and
i
pulled
the
lever
as
hard
as
i
could
the
great
gun
sprang
into
life
as
i
moved
the
lever
i
heard
the
roar
of
the
explosion
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
a
louder
bark
than
any
gun
i
had
heard
had
given
it
was
not
of
course
and
so
down
in
my
heart
i
knew
there
was
no
shade
of
variation
between
that
shot
and
all
the
others
that
had
been
fired
but
it
pleased
me
to
think
so
it
pleases
me
sometimes
to
think
so
even
now
just
as
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
that
long
snouted
engine
of
war
propelled
that
shell
under
my
guiding
hand
with
unwonted
accuracy
and
effectiveness
perhaps
i
was
childish
to
feel
as
i
did
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
was
so
but
i
dinna
care
there
was
no
report
by
telephone
from
normabell
about
that
particular
shot
i
hung
about
a
while
by
the
telephone
listeners
hoping
one
would
come
and
it
disappointed
me
that
no
attention
was
paid
to
that
shot
probably
simply
means
it
went
home
said
godfrey
a
shot
that
acts
just
as
it
should
does
get
reported
but
i
was
disappointed
just
the
same
and
yet
the
sensation
is
one
i
shall
never
forget
and
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
glad
that
the
major
gave
me
my
chance
the
most
thrilling
moment
was
that
of
the
recoil
of
the
great
gun
i
felt
exactly
as
one
does
when
one
dives
into
deep
water
from
a
considerable
height
good
work
harry
said
the
major
warmly
when
i
had
stepped
down
i
wager
you
wiped
out
a
bit
of
the
german
trenches
with
that
shot
i
think
i
draft
you
and
keep
you
here
as
a
gunner
and
the
officers
and
men
all
spoke
in
the
same
way
smiling
as
they
did
so
but
i
hae
me
doots
i
like
to
think
i
did
real
damage
with
my
one
shot
but
i
afraid
my
shell
was
just
one
of
those
that
turned
up
a
bit
of
dirt
and
made
one
of
those
small
brown
eruptions
i
had
seen
rising
on
all
sides
along
the
german
lines
as
i
had
sat
and
smoked
my
pipe
with
normabell
earlier
in
the
day
well
anyway
i
said
exultingly
that
that
i
hope
i
got
two
for
my
one
at
least
but
my
exultation
did
not
last
long
i
reflected
upon
the
inscrutability
of
war
and
of
this
deadly
fighting
that
was
going
on
all
about
me
how
casual
a
matter
was
this
sending
out
of
a
shell
that
could
in
a
flash
of
time
obliterate
all
that
lived
in
a
wide
circle
about
where
it
chanced
to
strike
the
pulling
of
a
lever
that
was
all
that
i
had
done
and
at
any
moment
a
shell
some
german
gunner
had
sent
winging
its
way
through
the
air
in
precisely
that
same
casual
fashion
might
come
tearing
into
this
quiet
nook
guided
by
some
chance
lucky
for
him
and
wipe
out
the
major
and
all
the
pleasant
boys
with
whom
i
had
broken
bread
just
now
and
the
sweating
gunners
who
had
cheered
me
on
as
i
fired
my
shot
i
was
to
give
a
concert
for
this
battery
and
i
felt
that
it
was
time
now
for
it
to
begin
i
could
see
too
that
the
men
were
growing
a
bit
impatient
and
so
i
said
that
i
was
ready
then
come
along
to
our
theater
said
the
major
and
grinned
at
my
look
of
astonishment
oh
we
got
a
real
amphitheater
for
you
such
as
the
greeks
used
for
the
tragedies
of
sophocles
he
said
there
it
is
he
had
not
stretched
the
truth
it
was
a
superb
theater
a
great
hole
in
the
ground
certainly
it
was
as
well
ventilated
a
show
house
as
you
could
hope
for
and
i
found
when
the
time
came
that
the
acoustics
were
splendid
i
went
down
into
the
middle
of
the
hole
with
hogge
and
adam
who
had
become
part
of
my
company
and
the
soldiers
grouped
themselves
about
its
rim
before
we
left
boulogne
a
definite
programme
had
been
laid
out
for
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
we
had
decided
that
we
would
get
better
results
by
adopting
a
programme
and
sticking
to
it
at
all
our
meetings
or
concerts
so
at
all
the
assemblies
that
we
gathered
hogge
opened
proceedings
by
talking
to
the
men
about
pensions
the
subject
in
which
he
was
so
vitally
interested
and
in
which
he
had
done
and
was
doing
such
magnificent
work
adam
would
follow
him
with
a
talk
about
the
war
and
its
progress
he
was
a
splendid
speaker
was
adam
he
had
all
the
eloquence
of
the
fine
preacher
that
he
was
but
he
did
not
preach
to
the
lads
in
the
trenches
not
he
he
told
them
about
the
war
and
about
the
way
the
folks
at
hame
in
britain
were
backing
them
up
he
talked
about
war
loans
and
food
conservation
and
made
them
understand
that
it
was
not
they
alone
who
were
doing
the
fighting
it
was
a
cheering
and
an
inspiring
talk
he
gave
them
and
he
got
good
round
applause
wherever
he
spoke
they
saved
me
up
for
the
last
and
when
adam
had
finished
speaking
either
he
or
hogge
would
introduce
me
and
my
singing
would
begin
that
was
the
programme
we
had
arranged
for
the
theater
as
the
canadians
called
their
amphitheater
for
this
performance
of
course
i
had
no
piano
johnson
and
the
wee
instrument
were
back
where
we
had
left
the
motor
cars
and
so
i
just
had
to
sing
without
an
accompaniment
except
that
which
the
great
booming
of
the
guns
was
to
furnish
me
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
the
guns
would
bother
me
but
as
i
listened
to
hogge
and
adam
i
ceased
gradually
to
notice
them
at
all
and
i
soon
felt
that
they
would
annoy
me
no
more
when
it
was
my
turn
to
go
on
than
the
chatter
of
a
bunch
of
stage
hands
in
the
wings
of
a
theater
had
so
often
done
when
it
was
my
turn
i
began
with
roamin
in
the
gloamin
the
verse
went
well
and
i
swung
into
the
chorus
i
had
picked
the
song
to
open
with
because
i
knew
the
soldiers
were
pretty
sure
to
know
it
and
so
would
join
me
in
the
chorus
which
is
something
i
always
want
them
to
do
and
these
were
no
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
but
just
as
i
got
into
the
chorus
the
tune
of
the
guns
changed
they
had
been
coughing
and
spitting
intermittently
but
now
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
as
if
someone
had
kicked
the
lid
off
the
fireworks
factory
and
dropped
a
lighted
torch
inside
every
gun
in
the
battery
around
the
hole
began
whanging
away
at
once
i
was
jumpy
and
nervous
i
admit
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
hold
to
the
pitch
and
not
break
the
time
i
thought
all
of
von
hindenburg
army
must
be
attacking
us
and
from
the
row
and
din
i
judged
he
must
have
brought
up
some
of
the
german
navy
to
help
instead
of
letting
it
lie
in
the
kiel
canal
where
the
british
fleet
could
not
get
at
it
i
never
heard
such
a
terrific
racket
in
all
my
days
i
took
the
opportunity
to
look
around
at
my
audience
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
excited
they
all
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
they
were
listening
to
the
guns
only
to
me
and
my
singing
and
so
as
they
probably
knew
what
was
afoot
and
took
it
so
quietly
i
managed
to
keep
on
singing
as
if
i
too
were
used
to
such
a
row
and
thought
no
more
of
it
than
of
the
ordinary
traffic
noise
of
a
london
or
a
glasgow
street
but
if
i
really
managed
to
look
that
way
my
appearances
were
most
deceptive
because
i
was
nearer
to
being
scared
than
i
had
been
at
any
time
yet
but
presently
i
began
to
get
interested
in
the
noise
of
the
guns
they
developed
a
certain
regular
rhythm
i
had
to
allow
for
it
and
make
it
fit
the
time
of
what
i
was
singing
and
as
i
realized
that
probably
this
was
just
a
part
of
the
regular
day
work
a
bit
of
ordinary
strafing
and
not
a
feature
of
a
grand
attack
i
took
note
of
the
rhythm
it
went
something
like
this
as
near
as
i
can
gie
it
to
you
in
print
roamin
in
the
puh
lah
gloamin
bam
on
the
whuff
boom
bonny
banks
o
biff
clyde
zow
and
so
it
went
all
through
the
rest
of
the
concert
i
had
to
adjust
each
song
i
sang
to
that
odd
rhythm
of
the
guns
and
i
do
know
but
what
it
was
just
as
well
that
johnson
was
there
he
have
had
trouble
staying
with
me
with
his
wee
bit
piano
i
thinkin
and
do
you
ken
i
got
to
see
after
a
bit
that
it
was
the
gunners
all
the
time
havin
a
bit
of
fun
with
me
for
when
i
sang
a
verse
the
guns
behaved
themselves
but
every
time
i
came
to
the
chorus
they
started
up
the
same
inferno
of
noise
again
i
think
they
wanted
to
see
at
first
if
they
could
no
shake
me
enough
to
make
me
stop
singing
and
they
liked
me
the
better
when
they
found
i
would
no
stop
the
soldiers
soon
began
to
laugh
but
the
joke
was
not
all
on
me
and
i
could
see
that
they
understood
that
and
were
pleased
indeed
it
was
all
as
amusing
to
me
as
to
them
i
doubt
if
roamin
in
the
gloamin
or
any
other
song
was
ever
sung
in
such
circumstances
i
sang
several
more
songs
they
called
as
every
audience
i
have
seems
to
do
for
me
to
sing
my
wee
hoose
amang
the
heather
and
then
captain
godfrey
brought
the
concert
to
an
end
it
was
getting
along
toward
midafternoon
and
he
explained
that
we
had
another
call
to
make
before
dark
harry
good
luck
to
you
thanks
for
the
singing
such
cries
rose
from
all
sides
and
the
canadians
came
crowding
around
to
shake
my
hand
it
was
touching
to
see
how
pleased
they
were
and
it
made
me
rejoice
that
i
had
been
able
to
come
i
had
thought
sometimes
that
it
might
be
a
presumptuous
thing
in
a
way
for
me
to
want
to
go
so
near
the
front
but
the
way
i
had
been
able
to
cheer
up
the
lonely
dull
routine
of
that
battery
went
far
to
justify
me
in
coming
i
thought
i
was
sorry
to
be
leaving
the
canadians
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
they
seemed
as
sorry
to
have
me
go
as
i
was
to
be
going
i
have
a
very
great
fondness
for
the
canadian
soldier
he
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
picturesque
and
interesting
of
all
the
men
who
are
fighting
under
the
flags
of
the
allies
and
it
is
certain
that
the
world
can
never
forget
the
record
he
has
made
in
this
war
a
record
of
courage
and
heroism
unexcelled
by
any
and
equaled
by
few
i
stood
around
while
we
were
getting
ready
to
start
back
to
the
cars
and
one
of
the
officers
was
with
me
how
often
do
you
get
a
shell
right
inside
the
pit
here
i
asked
him
a
fair
hit
i
mean
oh
i
do
know
he
said
slowly
he
looked
around
you
know
that
hole
you
were
singing
in
just
now
i
nodded
i
had
guessed
that
it
had
been
made
by
a
shell
well
that
the
result
of
a
boche
shell
he
said
if
you
come
yesterday
we
have
had
to
find
another
place
for
your
concert
oh
is
that
so
i
said
aye
he
said
and
grinned
we
did
tell
you
before
harry
because
we
did
want
you
to
feel
nervous
or
anything
like
that
while
you
were
singing
but
it
was
obliging
of
fritz
now
was
it
think
of
having
him
take
all
the
trouble
to
dig
out
a
fine
theater
for
us
that
way
it
was
obliging
of
him
to
be
sure
i
said
rather
dryly
that
what
we
said
said
the
officer
why
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
hole
that
shell
had
made
i
said
to
campbell
jove
the
very
place
for
harry
lauder
concert
and
he
agreed
with
me
now
it
was
time
for
handshaking
and
i
said
farewell
all
around
and
wished
good
luck
to
that
brave
battery
so
cunningly
hidden
away
in
its
pit
there
was
a
great
deal
of
cheery
shouting
and
waving
of
hands
as
we
went
off
and
in
two
minutes
the
battery
was
out
of
sight
even
though
we
knew
exactly
where
it
was
we
made
our
way
slowly
back
through
the
lengthening
shadows
over
the
ground
the
motor
cars
were
waiting
and
johnson
too
everything
was
shipshape
and
ready
for
a
new
start
and
we
climbed
in
as
we
drove
off
i
looked
back
at
vimy
ridge
and
i
continued
to
gaze
at
it
for
a
long
time
no
longer
did
it
disappoint
me
no
longer
did
i
regard
it
as
an
insignificant
hillock
all
that
feeling
that
had
come
to
me
with
my
first
sight
of
it
had
been
banished
by
my
introduction
to
the
famous
ridge
itself
it
had
spoken
to
me
eloquently
despite
the
muteness
of
the
myriad
tongues
it
had
it
had
graven
deep
into
my
heart
the
realization
of
its
true
place
in
history
an
excrescence
in
a
flat
country
a
little
hump
of
ground
that
is
all
there
is
to
vimy
ridge
aye
it
does
not
stand
so
high
above
the
ground
of
flanders
as
would
the
books
that
will
be
written
about
it
in
the
future
were
you
to
pile
them
all
up
together
when
the
last
one
of
them
is
printed
but
what
a
monument
it
is
to
bravery
and
to
sacrifice
to
all
that
is
best
in
this
human
race
of
ours
no
human
hands
have
ever
reared
such
a
monument
as
that
ridge
is
and
will
be
there
some
of
the
greatest
deeds
in
history
were
done
some
of
the
noblest
acts
that
there
is
record
of
performed
there
men
lived
and
died
gloriously
in
their
brief
moment
of
climax
the
moment
for
which
all
unknowing
all
their
lives
before
that
day
of
battle
had
been
lived
i
took
off
my
cap
as
i
looked
back
with
a
gesture
and
a
thought
of
deep
and
solemn
reverence
and
so
i
said
to
vimy
ridge
and
to
the
brave
men
i
had
known
there
living
and
dead
for
i
felt
that
i
had
come
to
know
some
of
the
dead
as
well
as
the
living
chapter
xviii
you
see
another
phase
of
the
front
now
harry
said
captain
godfrey
as
i
turned
my
eyes
to
the
front
once
more
what
the
next
stop
i
asked
we
heading
for
a
rest
billet
behind
the
lines
there
be
lots
of
men
there
who
are
just
out
of
the
trenches
it
a
ghastly
strain
for
even
the
best
and
most
seasoned
troops
this
work
in
the
trenches
so
after
a
battalion
has
been
in
for
a
certain
length
of
time
it
pulled
out
and
sent
back
to
a
rest
billet
what
do
they
do
there
i
asked
well
they
do
loaf
there
none
of
that
in
the
british
army
these
days
but
it
paradise
after
the
trenches
for
one
thing
there
is
the
constant
danger
there
is
up
front
the
men
under
steady
fire
of
course
there
always
the
chance
of
a
bomb
dropping
raid
by
a
taube
or
a
fokker
the
men
get
a
chance
to
clean
up
they
get
baths
and
their
clothes
are
cleaned
and
disinfected
they
get
rid
of
the
cooties
you
know
what
they
are
i
could
guess
the
plague
of
vermin
in
the
trenches
is
one
of
the
minor
horrors
of
war
they
do
a
lot
of
drilling
godfrey
went
on
except
for
those
times
in
the
rest
billets
regiments
might
get
a
bit
slack
in
the
trenches
you
see
the
routine
is
strict
but
it
different
men
are
much
more
on
their
own
there
are
any
inspections
of
kit
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
not
for
neatness
anyway
and
it
a
good
thing
for
soldiers
to
be
neat
it
helps
discipline
and
discipline
in
time
of
war
is
just
a
matter
it
means
lives
every
time
your
disciplined
man
who
trained
to
do
certain
things
automatically
is
the
man
you
can
depend
on
in
any
sort
of
emergency
that
the
thing
that
the
canadians
and
the
australians
have
had
to
learn
since
they
came
out
there
never
were
any
braver
troops
than
those
in
the
world
but
at
first
they
did
have
the
automatic
discipline
they
needed
that
be
the
first
problem
in
training
the
new
american
armies
too
it
a
highly
practical
matter
and
so
in
the
rest
billets
they
drill
the
men
a
goodish
bit
it
keeps
up
the
morale
and
makes
them
fitter
and
keener
for
the
work
when
they
go
back
to
the
trenches
you
do
make
it
sound
much
like
a
real
rest
for
them
i
said
oh
but
it
is
all
right
they
have
a
comfortable
place
to
sleep
they
get
better
food
the
men
in
the
trenches
get
the
best
food
possible
to
give
them
but
it
ca
be
cooked
much
for
there
facilities
the
diet
gets
pretty
monotonous
in
the
rest
billets
they
get
more
variety
and
they
have
plenty
of
free
time
and
there
are
hours
when
they
can
go
to
the
estaminet
there
always
one
handy
a
sort
of
pub
you
know
and
buy
things
for
themselves
oh
they
have
a
pretty
good
time
as
you
see
in
a
rest
billet
i
had
to
take
his
word
for
it
we
went
bowling
along
at
a
good
speed
but
pretty
soon
we
encountered
a
detachment
of
somerset
men
they
halted
when
they
spied
our
caravan
and
so
did
we
as
usual
they
recognized
us
you
harry
lauder
said
one
of
them
in
the
broad
accent
of
his
country
us
has
seen
often
johnson
was
out
already
and
he
and
the
drivers
were
unlimbering
the
wee
piano
it
did
take
so
long
now
that
we
were
getting
used
to
the
task
to
make
ready
for
a
roadside
concert
while
i
waited
i
talked
to
the
men
they
were
on
their
way
to
ypres
tommy
ca
get
the
name
right
and
long
ago
ceased
trying
to
do
so
the
french
and
belgians
call
it
eepre
that
as
near
as
i
can
give
it
to
you
in
print
at
least
but
tommy
as
all
the
world
must
know
by
now
calls
it
wipers
and
that
is
another
name
that
will
live
as
long
as
british
history
is
told
the
somerset
men
squatted
in
the
road
while
i
sang
my
songs
for
them
and
gave
me
their
most
rapt
attention
it
was
hugely
gratifying
and
flattering
the
silence
that
always
descended
upon
an
audience
of
soldiers
when
i
sang
there
were
never
any
interruptions
but
at
the
end
of
a
song
and
during
the
chorus
which
they
always
wanted
to
sing
with
me
as
i
wanted
them
to
do
too
they
made
up
for
their
silence
soon
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
was
on
its
way
again
the
cheers
of
the
somerset
men
sounded
gayly
in
our
ears
and
the
cars
quickly
picked
up
speed
and
began
to
mop
up
the
miles
at
a
great
rate
and
then
suddenly
whoa
we
were
in
the
midst
of
soldiers
again
this
time
it
was
a
bunch
of
motor
repair
men
they
wandered
along
the
roads
working
on
the
trucks
and
cars
that
were
abandoned
when
they
got
into
trouble
and
left
along
the
side
of
the
road
we
had
seen
scores
of
such
wrecks
that
day
and
i
had
wondered
if
they
were
left
there
indefinitely
far
from
it
as
i
learned
now
squads
like
this
there
were
two
hundred
men
in
this
particular
party
were
always
at
work
many
of
the
cars
they
salvaged
without
difficulty
those
that
had
been
abandoned
because
of
comparatively
minor
engine
troubles
or
defects
others
had
to
be
towed
to
a
repair
shop
or
loaded
upon
other
trucks
for
the
journey
if
their
wheels
were
out
of
commission
others
still
were
beyond
repair
they
had
been
utterly
smashed
in
a
collision
maybe
or
as
a
result
of
skidding
or
they
had
burned
sometimes
they
had
been
knocked
off
the
road
and
generally
demoralized
by
a
shell
and
in
such
cases
often
all
that
men
such
as
these
we
had
met
now
could
do
was
to
retrieve
some
parts
to
be
used
in
repairing
other
cars
in
a
less
hopeless
state
by
this
time
johnson
and
the
two
soldier
chauffeurs
had
reduced
the
business
of
setting
our
stage
to
a
fine
point
it
took
us
but
a
very
few
minutes
indeed
to
be
ready
for
a
concert
and
from
the
time
when
we
sighted
a
potential
audience
to
the
moment
for
the
opening
number
was
an
almost
incredibly
brief
period
this
time
that
was
a
good
thing
for
it
was
growing
late
and
so
although
the
repair
men
were
loath
to
let
me
go
it
was
but
an
abbreviated
programme
that
i
was
able
to
offer
them
this
was
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
audiences
i
had
had
yet
for
nearly
every
man
there
it
turned
out
had
been
what
americans
would
call
a
harry
lauder
fan
in
the
old
days
they
had
been
wont
to
go
again
and
again
to
hear
me
i
wanted
to
stay
and
sing
more
songs
for
them
but
captain
godfrey
was
in
charge
and
i
had
to
obey
his
orders
reluctant
though
i
was
to
go
on
our
destination
was
a
town
called
aubigny
rather
an
old
chateau
just
outside
the
town
aubigny
was
the
billet
of
the
fifteenth
division
then
in
rest
many
officers
were
quartered
in
the
chateau
as
the
guests
of
its
french
owners
who
remained
in
possession
having
refused
to
clear
out
despite
the
nearness
of
the
actual
fighting
front
this
was
a
scots
division
i
was
glad
to
find
i
heard
good
scots
talk
all
around
me
when
i
arrived
and
it
was
scottish
hospitality
mingled
with
french
that
awaited
us
i
know
no
finer
combination
nor
one
more
warming
to
the
cockles
of
a
man
heart
here
there
was
luxury
compared
to
what
i
had
seen
that
day
as
godfrey
had
warned
me
the
idea
of
resting
that
the
troops
had
was
a
bit
more
strenuous
than
mine
would
be
there
was
no
lying
and
lolling
about
hot
though
the
weather
was
a
deal
of
football
was
played
and
there
were
games
of
one
sort
and
another
going
on
nearly
all
the
time
when
the
men
were
off
duty
this
division
i
learned
had
seen
some
of
the
hardest
and
bloodiest
fighting
of
the
whole
war
they
had
been
through
the
great
offensive
that
had
pivoted
on
arras
and
had
been
sorely
knocked
about
they
had
well
earned
such
rest
as
was
coming
to
them
now
and
they
were
getting
ready
in
the
most
cheerful
way
you
can
imagine
for
their
next
tour
of
duty
in
the
trenches
they
knew
about
how
much
time
they
would
have
and
they
made
the
best
use
they
could
of
it
new
drafts
were
coming
out
daily
from
home
to
fill
up
their
sadly
depleted
ranks
the
new
men
were
quickly
drawn
in
and
assimilated
into
organizations
that
had
been
reduced
to
mere
skeletons
new
officers
were
getting
acquainted
with
their
men
that
wonderful
thing
that
is
called
esprit
de
corps
was
being
made
all
around
me
it
is
a
great
sight
to
watch
it
in
the
making
it
helps
you
to
understand
the
victories
our
laddies
have
won
i
was
glad
to
see
the
kilted
men
of
the
scots
regiments
all
about
me
it
was
them
after
all
that
i
had
come
to
see
i
wanted
to
talk
to
them
and
see
them
here
in
france
i
had
seen
them
at
hame
flocking
to
the
recruiting
offices
i
had
seen
them
in
their
training
camps
but
this
was
different
i
love
all
the
soldiers
of
the
empire
but
it
is
natural
is
it
no
that
my
warmest
feeling
should
be
for
the
laddies
who
wear
the
kilt
they
were
the
most
cheerful
souls
as
i
saw
them
when
we
reached
their
rest
camp
that
you
could
imagine
they
were
laughing
and
joking
all
about
us
and
when
they
heard
that
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
had
arrived
they
crowded
about
us
to
see
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
was
there
and
i
was
greeted
in
all
sorts
of
dialect
that
sounded
enough
i
be
bound
to
godfrey
and
some
of
the
rest
of
our
party
there
were
even
men
who
spoke
to
me
in
the
gaelic
i
saw
a
good
deal
afterward
of
these
scots
troops
my
how
hard
they
did
work
while
they
rested
and
what
chances
they
took
of
broken
bones
and
bruises
in
their
play
ye
would
think
would
ye
no
that
they
had
enough
of
that
in
the
trenches
where
they
got
lumps
and
bruises
and
sorer
hurts
in
the
run
of
duty
but
no
so
soon
as
they
came
back
to
their
rest
billets
they
must
begin
to
play
by
knocking
the
skin
and
the
hair
off
one
another
at
sports
of
various
sorts
of
which
football
was
among
the
mildest
that
are
not
by
any
means
to
be
recommended
to
those
of
a
delicate
fiber
some
of
the
men
i
met
at
aubigny
had
been
out
since
mons
some
of
the
old
kilted
regiments
of
the
old
regular
army
they
were
away
back
in
those
desperate
days
the
germans
had
dubbed
them
the
ladies
from
hell
on
account
of
their
kilts
some
of
the
germans
really
thought
they
were
women
that
was
learned
from
prisoners
since
mons
they
have
been
out
and
auld
scotland
has
poured
out
men
by
the
scores
of
thousands
as
fast
as
they
were
needed
to
fill
the
gaps
the
german
shells
and
bullets
have
torn
in
the
scots
ranks
aye
since
mons
and
they
will
be
there
at
the
finish
when
it
comes
please
god
there
have
always
been
scots
regiments
in
the
british
army
ever
since
the
day
when
king
jamie
the
sixth
of
scotland
of
the
famous
and
unhappy
house
of
stuart
became
king
james
the
first
of
england
the
kilted
regiments
the
highlanders
belonging
to
the
immortal
highland
brigade
include
the
gordon
highlanders
the
the
world
famous
black
watch
as
it
is
better
known
than
by
its
numbered
designation
the
seaforth
highlanders
and
the
argyle
and
sutherland
regiment
or
the
princess
louise
own
that
was
the
regiment
to
a
territorial
battalion
of
which
my
boy
john
belonged
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
with
which
he
served
until
he
was
killed
some
of
those
old
famous
regiments
have
been
wiped
out
half
a
dozen
times
almost
literally
annihilated
since
mons
new
drafts
and
the
addition
of
territorial
battalions
have
replenished
them
and
kept
up
their
strength
and
the
continuity
of
their
tradition
has
never
been
broken
the
men
who
compose
a
regiment
may
be
wiped
out
but
the
regiment
survives
it
is
an
organization
an
entity
a
creature
with
a
soul
as
well
as
a
body
and
the
germans
have
no
discovered
a
way
yet
of
killing
the
soul
they
can
do
dreadful
things
to
the
bodies
of
men
and
women
but
their
souls
are
safe
from
them
of
course
there
are
scots
regiments
that
are
not
kilted
and
that
have
naught
to
do
with
the
hielanders
who
have
given
as
fine
and
brave
an
account
of
themselves
as
any
there
are
the
scots
guards
one
of
the
regiments
of
the
guards
brigade
the
very
pick
and
flower
of
the
british
army
there
are
the
king
own
scottish
borderers
with
as
fine
a
history
and
tradition
as
any
regiment
in
the
army
and
a
record
of
service
of
which
any
regiment
might
well
be
proud
the
scots
fusiliers
the
royal
scots
the
scottish
rifles
and
the
scots
greys
of
crimean
fame
the
only
cavalry
regiment
from
scotland
since
this
war
began
other
highland
regiments
have
been
raised
beside
those
originally
included
in
the
highland
brigade
there
are
scots
from
canada
who
wear
the
kilt
and
their
own
tartan
and
cap
every
highland
regiment
of
course
has
its
own
distinguishing
tartan
and
cap
one
of
the
proudest
moments
of
my
life
came
when
i
heard
that
the
ninth
battalion
of
the
highland
light
infantry
which
was
raised
in
glasgow
but
has
its
depot
where
its
recruits
and
new
drafts
are
trained
at
hamilton
was
known
as
the
harry
landers
that
was
because
they
had
adopted
the
balmoral
cap
with
dice
that
had
become
associated
with
me
because
i
had
worn
it
so
often
and
so
long
on
the
stage
in
singing
one
of
my
most
famous
and
successful
songs
i
love
a
lassie
but
in
the
trenches
of
course
the
hieland
troops
all
look
alike
they
cling
to
their
kilts
or
rather
their
kilts
cling
to
them
but
kilts
and
jackets
are
all
of
khaki
if
they
wore
the
bright
plaids
of
the
tartans
they
would
be
much
too
conspicuous
a
mark
for
the
germans
and
so
they
have
to
forswear
their
much
loved
colors
when
they
are
actually
at
grips
with
fritz
i
wear
the
kilt
nearly
always
myself
as
i
have
said
partly
i
do
so
because
it
is
my
native
costume
and
i
am
proud
of
my
highland
birth
partly
because
i
revel
in
the
comfort
of
the
costume
but
it
brings
me
some
amusing
experiences
very
often
i
am
asked
a
question
that
is
i
presume
fired
at
many
a
hieland
soldier
intimate
though
it
is
i
say
harry
someone
will
ask
me
you
wear
the
kilt
do
you
not
wear
anything
underneath
it
i
do
myself
i
wear
a
very
short
pair
of
trunks
chiefly
for
reasons
of
modesty
so
do
some
of
the
soldiers
but
if
they
do
they
must
provide
it
for
themselves
no
such
garment
is
served
out
to
them
with
their
uniform
and
so
the
vast
majority
of
the
men
wear
nothing
but
their
skins
under
the
kilt
he
is
bare
that
is
from
the
waist
to
the
hose
except
for
the
kilt
but
that
is
garment
enough
i
tell
ye
so
and
i
thinkin
i
know
so
clad
the
highland
soldier
is
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
and
a
great
deal
more
sanely
dressed
i
believe
than
the
city
dweller
who
is
trousered
and
underweared
within
an
inch
of
his
life
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
medical
record
that
can
be
verified
from
the
reports
of
the
army
surgeons
that
the
kilted
troops
are
among
the
healthiest
in
the
whole
army
i
know
that
the
highland
troops
are
much
less
subject
to
abdominal
troubles
of
all
sorts
colic
and
the
like
the
kilt
lies
snug
and
warm
around
the
stomach
in
several
thick
layers
and
a
more
perfect
protection
from
the
cold
has
never
been
devised
for
that
highly
delicate
and
susceptible
region
of
the
human
anatomy
women
particularly
are
always
asking
me
another
question
i
have
seen
them
eyeing
me
in
cold
weather
when
i
was
walkin
around
comfortably
in
my
kilt
and
their
eyes
would
wander
to
my
knees
and
i
would
know
before
they
opened
their
mouths
what
it
was
that
they
were
going
to
say
oh
lauder
they
would
ask
me
do
your
poor
knees
get
cold
with
no
coverings
exposed
to
this
bitter
cold
well
they
never
have
that
all
i
can
tell
you
they
have
had
the
chance
in
all
sorts
of
bitter
weather
i
am
not
thinking
only
of
the
comparitively
mild
winters
of
britain
although
up
north
in
scotland
we
get
some
pretty
severe
winter
weather
but
i
have
been
in
western
canada
and
in
the
northwestern
states
of
the
united
states
montana
north
dakota
minnesota
where
the
thermometer
drops
far
below
zero
and
my
knees
have
never
been
cold
yet
they
do
not
suffer
from
the
cold
any
more
than
does
my
face
which
is
as
little
covered
and
protected
as
they
and
for
the
same
reason
i
suppose
they
are
used
to
the
weather
and
when
it
comes
to
the
general
question
of
health
i
am
certain
from
my
own
experience
that
the
kilt
is
best
several
times
for
one
reason
or
another
i
have
laid
my
kilts
aside
and
put
on
trousers
and
each
time
i
have
been
seized
by
violent
colds
and
my
life
has
been
made
wretched
a
good
many
soldiers
of
my
acquaintance
have
had
the
same
experience
practical
reasons
aside
however
the
scots
soldier
loves
his
kilt
and
would
fight
like
a
steer
to
keep
from
having
it
taken
away
from
him
should
anyone
be
so
foolish
as
to
try
such
a
performance
he
loves
it
not
only
because
it
is
warm
and
comfortable
but
because
it
is
indistinguishably
associated
in
his
mind
with
some
of
the
most
glorious
pages
of
scottish
history
it
is
a
sign
and
symbol
of
his
hameland
to
him
there
have
been
times
in
scotland
when
all
was
not
as
peaceful
in
the
country
relations
with
england
as
it
now
is
when
the
loyal
scot
who
wore
the
kilt
did
so
knowing
that
he
might
be
tried
for
his
life
for
doing
so
since
death
had
been
the
penalty
appointed
for
that
crime
aye
it
is
peace
and
friendship
now
between
scot
and
englishman
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
is
no
a
friendly
rivalry
between
them
still
english
regiments
and
scots
regiments
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
one
another
and
a
bit
rough
it
gets
too
at
times
but
it
is
all
in
fun
and
there
is
no
harm
done
i
have
in
mind
a
tale
an
officer
told
me
though
the
men
of
whom
he
told
it
did
not
know
that
an
officer
had
any
inkling
of
the
story
the
english
soldiers
are
very
fond
of
harping
on
the
old
idea
of
the
difficulty
of
making
a
scotsman
see
a
joke
that
is
a
base
slander
i
say
but
no
matter
there
were
two
regiments
in
rest
close
to
one
another
one
english
and
one
scots
they
met
at
the
estaminet
or
pub
in
the
nearby
town
and
one
day
the
englishman
put
up
a
great
joke
on
some
of
the
scots
and
did
get
a
little
proof
of
that
pet
idea
of
theirs
for
the
scots
were
slow
to
see
the
joke
ah
weel
that
was
enough
for
days
the
english
rang
the
changes
on
that
joke
teasing
the
hielanders
and
making
sport
of
them
but
at
last
when
the
worst
of
the
tormentors
were
all
assembled
together
two
of
the
scots
came
into
the
room
where
they
were
havin
a
wee
drappie
mon
sandy
said
one
of
them
shaking
his
head
i
been
thinking
what
a
sad
thing
that
would
be
i
hope
it
will
no
come
to
pass
aye
that
would
be
a
sore
business
indeed
tam
said
sandy
and
he
too
shook
his
head
and
so
they
went
on
the
englishmen
stood
it
as
long
as
they
could
and
then
one
turned
to
sandy
what
is
it
would
be
such
a
bad
business
he
asked
said
sandy
we
been
thinking
tam
and
i
what
would
become
of
england
should
scotland
make
a
separate
peace
and
it
was
generally
conceded
that
the
last
laugh
was
with
the
scots
in
that
affair
my
boy
john
had
the
same
love
for
the
kilt
that
i
had
he
was
proud
and
glad
to
wear
the
kilt
and
to
lead
men
who
did
the
same
while
he
was
in
training
at
bedford
he
organized
a
corps
of
cyclists
for
work
he
was
a
crack
cyclist
himself
and
it
was
a
sport
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
so
he
took
a
great
interest
in
the
corps
and
it
soon
gained
wide
fame
for
its
efficiency
so
true
was
that
that
the
authorities
took
note
of
the
corps
and
of
john
who
was
responsible
for
it
and
he
was
asked
to
go
to
france
to
take
charge
of
organizing
a
similar
corps
behind
the
front
but
that
would
have
involved
a
transfer
to
a
different
branch
of
the
army
and
detachment
from
his
regiment
and
it
would
have
meant
that
he
must
doff
his
kilt
since
he
had
the
chance
to
decline
it
was
an
offer
not
an
order
that
had
come
to
him
he
did
that
he
might
keep
his
kilt
and
stay
with
his
own
men
to
my
eyes
there
is
no
spectacle
that
begins
to
be
so
imposing
as
the
sight
of
a
parade
of
scottish
troops
in
full
uniform
and
it
is
the
unanimous
testimony
of
german
prisoners
that
this
war
has
brought
them
no
more
terrifying
sight
than
the
charge
of
a
kilted
regiment
the
highlanders
come
leaping
forward
their
bayonets
gleaming
shouting
old
battle
cries
that
rang
through
the
glens
years
and
centuries
ago
and
that
have
come
down
to
the
descendants
of
the
warriors
of
an
ancient
time
the
highlanders
love
to
use
cold
steel
the
claymore
was
their
old
weapon
and
the
bayonet
is
its
nearest
equivalent
in
modern
war
they
are
master
hands
with
that
too
and
the
bayonet
is
the
one
thing
the
hun
has
no
stomach
for
at
all
fritz
is
brave
enough
when
he
is
under
such
cover
and
shelter
as
the
trenches
give
and
he
has
shown
a
sort
of
stubborn
courage
when
attacking
in
massed
formations
the
germans
have
made
terrible
sacrifices
at
times
in
their
offensive
efforts
but
his
blood
turns
to
water
in
his
veins
when
he
sees
the
big
braw
laddies
from
the
hielands
come
swooping
toward
him
their
kilts
flapping
and
their
bayonets
shining
in
whatever
light
there
is
then
he
is
mighty
quick
to
throw
up
his
hands
and
shout
kamerad
kamerad
i
might
go
on
all
night
telling
you
some
of
the
stories
i
heard
along
the
front
about
the
scottish
soldiers
they
illustrate
and
explain
every
phase
of
his
character
they
exploit
his
humor
despite
that
base
slander
to
which
i
have
already
referred
his
courage
his
stoicism
and
of
course
a
vast
fund
of
stories
has
sprung
up
that
deals
with
the
proverbial
thrift
of
the
scot
there
was
one
tale
that
will
bear
repeating
perhaps
two
highlanders
had
captured
a
chicken
a
live
chicken
not
particularly
fat
it
may
be
even
a
bit
scrawny
but
still
a
live
chicken
that
was
a
prize
since
the
bird
seemed
to
have
no
owner
who
might
get
them
into
trouble
with
the
military
police
one
was
for
killing
and
eating
the
fowl
at
once
but
the
other
would
have
none
of
such
a
summary
plan
no
no
jimmy
he
said
pleadingly
holding
the
chicken
protectingly
let
keep
her
until
morning
and
may
be
we
will
an
egg
as
well
illustration
us
laugh
again
harry
though
i
remember
my
son
and
want
to
join
the
ranks
i
have
obeyed
lauder
addressing
british
troops
behind
the
lines
in
france
see
the
other
british
soldiers
call
the
scots
jock
invariably
the
englishman
or
a
soldier
from
wales
or
ireland
as
a
rule
is
called
tommy
after
the
thomas
atkins
sometimes
an
irishman
will
be
paddy
and
a
welshman
taffy
but
the
scot
is
always
jock
jock
gave
us
a
grand
welcome
at
aubigny
we
were
all
pretty
tired
but
when
they
told
me
i
could
have
an
audience
of
seven
thousand
scots
soldiers
i
forgot
my
weariness
and
hogge
adam
and
i
to
say
nothing
of
johnson
and
the
wee
piano
cleared
for
action
as
you
might
say
the
concert
was
given
in
the
picturesque
grounds
of
the
chateau
which
had
been
less
harshly
treated
by
the
war
than
many
such
beautiful
old
places
it
was
a
great
experience
to
sing
to
so
many
men
it
was
far
and
away
the
largest
house
we
had
had
since
we
had
landed
at
boulogne
after
we
left
aubigny
the
chateau
and
that
great
audience
we
drove
on
as
quickly
as
we
could
since
it
was
now
late
to
the
headquarters
of
general
mac
commanding
the
fifteenth
division
to
which
of
course
the
men
whom
we
had
just
been
entertaining
belonged
i
was
to
meet
the
general
upon
my
arrival
that
was
a
strange
ride
it
was
pitch
dark
and
we
had
some
distance
to
go
there
were
mighty
few
lights
in
evidence
you
do
not
advertise
a
road
to
fritz
airplanes
when
you
are
traveling
roads
anywhere
near
the
front
for
he
has
guns
of
long
range
that
can
at
times
manage
to
strafe
a
road
that
is
supposed
to
be
beyond
the
zone
of
fire
with
a
good
deal
of
effect
i
have
seldom
seen
a
blacker
night
than
that
objects
along
the
side
of
the
road
were
nothing
but
shapeless
lumps
and
i
did
not
see
how
our
drivers
could
manage
at
all
to
find
their
way
they
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
however
but
got
along
swimmingly
indeed
they
traveled
faster
than
they
had
in
daylight
perhaps
that
was
because
we
were
not
meeting
troops
to
hold
us
up
along
this
road
i
believe
that
if
we
had
we
should
have
stopped
and
given
them
a
concert
even
though
johnson
could
not
have
seen
the
keys
of
his
piano
it
was
just
as
well
however
i
was
delighted
at
the
reception
that
had
been
given
to
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
all
through
our
first
day
in
france
but
i
was
also
extremely
tired
and
the
dinner
and
bed
that
loomed
up
ahead
of
us
at
the
end
of
our
long
ride
through
the
dark
took
on
an
aspect
of
enchantment
as
we
neared
them
my
voice
used
as
i
was
to
doing
a
great
deal
of
singing
was
fagged
and
hogge
and
adam
were
so
hoarse
that
they
could
scarcely
speak
at
all
even
johnson
was
pretty
well
done
up
he
was
still
theoretically
at
least
on
the
sick
list
of
course
and
i
ha
no
doot
that
the
wee
piano
felt
it
was
entitled
to
its
rest
too
so
we
were
all
mighty
glad
when
the
cars
stopped
at
last
well
here
we
are
said
captain
godfrey
who
was
the
freshest
of
us
all
this
is
tramecourt
general
headquarters
for
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
while
you
are
in
france
gentlemen
they
have
special
facilities
for
visitors
here
and
unless
one
of
airplanes
feels
disposed
to
drop
a
bomb
or
two
you
wo
be
under
fire
at
night
at
least
of
course
in
the
daytime
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
for
our
plans
did
not
involve
a
search
for
safe
places
still
it
was
pleasant
to
know
that
we
might
sleep
in
fair
comfort
general
mac
was
waiting
to
welcome
us
and
told
us
that
dinner
was
ready
and
waiting
which
we
were
all
glad
to
hear
it
had
been
a
long
hard
day
although
the
most
interesting
one
by
far
that
i
had
ever
spent
we
made
short
work
of
dinner
and
soon
afterward
they
took
us
to
our
rooms
i
do
know
what
hogge
and
adam
did
but
i
know
i
looked
happily
at
the
comfortable
bed
that
was
in
my
room
and
i
slept
easily
and
without
being
rocked
to
sleep
that
nicht
chapter
xix
though
we
were
out
of
the
zone
of
fire
except
for
stray
activities
in
which
boche
airplanes
might
indulge
themselves
as
our
hosts
were
frequently
likely
to
remind
us
lest
we
fancy
ourselves
too
secure
i
suppose
we
were
by
no
means
out
of
hearing
of
the
grim
work
that
was
going
on
a
few
miles
away
the
big
guns
of
course
are
placed
well
behind
the
front
line
trenches
and
we
could
hear
their
sullen
constant
quarreling
with
fritz
and
his
artillery
the
rumble
of
the
hun
guns
came
to
us
too
but
that
is
a
sound
to
which
you
soon
get
used
out
there
in
france
you
pay
no
more
heed
to
it
than
you
do
to
the
noise
the
make
in
london
or
the
trams
in
glasgow
in
the
morning
i
got
my
first
chance
really
to
see
tramecourt
the
chateau
is
a
lovely
one
a
fine
example
of
such
places
it
had
not
been
knocked
about
at
all
and
it
looked
much
as
it
must
have
done
in
times
of
peace
practically
all
the
old
furniture
was
still
in
the
rooms
and
there
were
some
fine
old
pictures
on
the
walls
that
it
gave
me
great
delight
to
see
indeed
the
rare
old
atmosphere
of
the
chateau
was
restful
and
delightful
in
a
way
that
surprised
me
i
had
been
in
the
presence
of
real
war
for
just
one
day
and
yet
i
took
pleasure
in
seeing
again
the
comforts
and
some
of
the
luxuries
of
peace
that
gave
me
an
idea
of
what
this
sort
of
place
must
mean
to
men
from
the
trenches
it
must
seem
like
a
bit
of
heaven
to
them
to
come
back
to
aubigny
or
tramecourt
think
of
the
contrast
the
chateau
which
had
been
taken
over
by
the
british
army
belonged
to
the
comte
de
chabot
or
rather
to
his
wife
who
had
been
marquise
de
tramecourt
one
of
the
french
families
of
the
old
regime
although
the
old
nobility
of
france
has
ceased
to
have
any
legal
existence
under
the
republic
the
old
titles
are
still
used
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
and
they
have
a
real
meaning
and
value
this
was
a
pleasant
place
this
chateau
of
tramecourt
i
should
like
to
see
it
again
in
days
of
peace
for
then
it
must
be
even
more
delightful
than
it
was
when
i
came
to
know
it
so
well
tramecourt
was
to
be
our
home
the
headquarters
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
during
the
rest
of
our
stay
at
the
front
we
were
to
start
out
each
morning
in
the
cars
to
cover
the
ground
appointed
for
that
day
and
to
return
at
night
but
it
was
understood
that
there
would
be
days
when
we
would
get
too
far
away
to
return
at
night
and
other
sleeping
quarters
would
be
provided
on
such
occasions
i
grew
very
fond
of
the
place
while
i
was
there
the
steady
pounding
of
the
guns
did
not
disturb
my
peace
of
nights
as
a
rule
but
there
was
one
night
when
i
did
lie
awake
for
hours
listening
even
to
my
unpracticed
ear
there
was
a
different
quality
in
the
sound
of
the
cannon
that
night
it
had
a
fury
an
intensity
that
went
beyond
anything
i
had
heard
and
later
i
learned
that
i
had
made
no
mistake
in
thinking
that
there
was
something
unusual
and
portentous
about
the
fire
that
night
what
i
had
listened
to
was
the
preliminary
drum
fire
and
bombardment
that
prepared
the
way
for
the
great
attack
at
messines
near
ypres
the
most
terrific
bombardment
recorded
in
all
history
up
to
that
time
the
fire
that
night
was
like
a
guttural
chant
it
had
a
real
rhythm
the
beat
of
the
guns
could
almost
be
counted
and
at
dawn
there
came
the
terrific
explosion
of
the
great
mine
that
had
been
prepared
which
was
the
signal
for
the
charge
i
am
told
knowing
the
exact
moment
at
which
the
mine
was
to
be
exploded
was
awake
at
home
in
england
and
heard
it
across
the
channel
and
so
did
many
folk
who
did
not
have
his
exceptional
sources
of
information
i
was
one
of
them
and
i
wondered
greatly
until
i
was
told
what
had
been
done
that
was
one
of
the
most
brilliantly
and
successfully
executed
attacks
of
the
whole
war
and
vastly
important
in
its
results
although
it
was
compared
to
the
great
battles
on
the
somme
and
up
north
near
arras
only
a
small
and
minor
operation
we
settled
down
very
quickly
indeed
into
a
regular
routine
captain
godfrey
was
for
all
the
world
like
the
manager
of
a
traveling
company
in
america
he
mapped
out
our
routes
and
he
took
care
of
all
the
details
no
troupe
covering
a
long
route
of
one
night
stands
in
the
western
or
southern
united
states
ever
worked
harder
than
did
hogge
adam
and
i
to
say
nothing
of
godfrey
and
our
soldier
chauffeurs
we
did
not
lie
abed
late
in
the
mornings
but
were
up
soon
after
daylight
breakfast
out
of
the
way
we
would
find
the
cars
waiting
and
be
off
we
had
always
a
definite
route
mapped
out
for
the
day
but
we
never
adhered
to
it
exactly
i
was
still
particularly
pleased
with
the
idea
of
giving
a
roadside
concert
whenever
an
audience
appeared
and
there
was
no
lack
of
willing
listeners
soon
after
we
had
set
out
from
tramecourt
no
matter
in
which
direction
we
happened
to
be
going
we
were
sure
to
run
into
some
body
of
soldiers
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
orders
as
soon
as
the
chauffeur
of
the
leading
car
spied
a
blotch
of
khaki
against
the
road
on
went
his
brakes
and
we
would
come
sliding
into
the
midst
of
the
troops
and
stop
johnson
would
be
out
before
his
car
had
fairly
stopped
and
at
work
upon
the
lashings
of
the
little
piano
with
me
to
help
him
and
hogge
would
already
be
clearing
his
throat
to
begin
his
speech
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
employed
no
press
agent
and
it
could
not
boast
of
a
bill
poster
no
hoardings
were
covered
with
great
colored
sheets
advertising
its
coming
and
yet
the
whole
front
seemed
to
know
that
we
were
about
the
soldiers
we
met
along
the
roads
welcomed
us
gladly
but
they
were
no
longer
after
the
first
day
or
two
surprised
to
see
us
they
acted
rather
as
if
they
had
been
expecting
us
our
advent
was
like
that
of
a
circus
coming
to
a
country
town
for
a
long
heralded
and
advertised
engagement
yet
all
the
puffing
that
we
got
was
by
word
of
mouth
there
were
some
wonderful
choruses
along
those
roads
we
traveled
roamin
in
the
gloamin
was
still
my
featured
song
and
all
the
soldiers
seemed
to
know
the
tune
and
the
words
and
to
take
a
particular
delight
in
coming
in
with
me
as
i
swung
into
the
chorus
we
never
passed
a
detachment
of
soldiers
without
stopping
to
give
them
a
concert
no
matter
how
it
disarranged
captain
godfrey
plans
but
he
was
entirely
willing
it
was
these
men
on
their
way
to
the
trenches
or
on
the
way
out
of
them
bound
for
rest
billets
whom
of
course
i
was
most
anxious
to
reach
since
i
felt
that
they
were
the
ones
i
was
most
likely
to
be
able
to
help
and
cheer
up
the
scheduled
concerts
were
practically
all
at
the
various
rest
billets
we
visited
these
were
in
the
main
at
chateaux
always
at
such
a
place
i
had
a
double
audience
the
soldiers
would
make
a
great
ring
as
close
to
me
as
they
could
get
and
around
them
again
in
a
sort
of
outer
circle
were
french
villagers
and
peasants
vastly
puzzled
and
mystified
but
eager
to
be
pleased
and
very
ready
with
their
applause
it
must
have
been
hard
for
them
to
make
up
their
minds
about
me
if
they
gave
me
much
thought
my
kilt
confused
them
most
of
them
thought
i
was
a
soldier
from
some
regiment
they
had
not
yet
seen
wearing
a
new
and
strange
uniform
for
my
kilt
i
need
not
say
was
not
military
nor
was
the
rest
of
my
garb
warlike
i
gave
during
that
time
as
many
as
seven
concerts
in
a
day
i
have
sung
as
often
as
times
in
one
day
and
on
such
occasions
i
was
thankful
that
i
had
a
strong
and
durable
voice
not
easily
worn
out
as
well
as
a
stout
physique
hogge
and
adam
appeared
as
often
as
i
did
but
they
did
have
to
sing
nearly
all
the
songs
i
gave
them
were
ditties
they
had
known
for
a
long
time
the
one
exception
was
the
tune
that
had
been
so
popular
in
three
cheers
the
one
called
the
laddies
who
fought
and
won
few
of
the
boys
had
been
home
since
i
had
been
singing
that
song
but
it
has
a
catching
lilt
and
they
were
soon
able
to
join
in
the
chorus
and
send
it
thundering
along
they
took
to
it
too
and
well
they
might
it
was
of
such
as
they
that
it
was
written
we
covered
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
a
day
during
this
period
that
does
not
sound
like
a
great
distance
for
motor
cars
but
we
did
a
good
deal
of
stopping
you
see
here
and
there
and
everywhere
we
were
roaming
around
in
the
backwater
of
war
you
might
say
we
were
out
of
the
main
stream
of
carnage
but
it
was
not
out
of
our
minds
and
our
hearts
evidences
of
it
in
plenty
came
to
us
each
day
and
each
day
we
were
a
little
nearer
to
the
front
line
trenches
than
we
had
come
the
day
before
we
were
working
gradually
toward
that
climax
that
i
had
been
promised
i
was
always
eager
to
talk
to
officers
and
men
and
i
found
many
chances
to
do
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
never
learn
enough
about
the
soldiers
i
listened
avidly
to
every
story
that
was
told
to
me
and
was
always
asking
for
more
the
younger
officers
especially
it
interested
me
to
talk
with
one
day
i
was
talking
to
such
a
lieutenant
how
is
the
spirit
of
your
men
i
asked
him
i
am
going
to
tell
you
his
answer
just
as
he
made
it
their
spirit
he
said
musingly
well
just
before
we
came
to
this
billet
to
rest
we
were
in
a
tightish
corner
on
the
somme
one
of
my
youngest
men
was
hit
a
shell
came
near
to
taking
his
arm
clean
off
so
that
it
was
left
just
hanging
to
his
shoulders
he
was
only
about
eighteen
years
old
poor
chap
it
was
a
bad
wound
but
as
sometimes
happens
it
did
make
him
unconscious
then
and
when
he
realized
what
had
happened
to
him
and
saw
his
arm
hanging
limp
so
that
he
could
know
he
was
bound
to
lose
it
he
began
to
cry
the
trouble
i
asked
him
hurrying
over
to
him
i
was
sorry
enough
for
him
but
you
got
to
keep
up
the
morale
of
your
men
do
cry
when
they
wounded
my
lad
not
crying
because
i
wounded
sir
he
fired
back
at
me
and
i
wo
say
he
was
quite
as
respectful
as
a
private
is
supposed
to
be
when
he
talking
to
an
officer
take
a
look
at
that
sir
and
he
pointed
to
his
wound
and
then
he
cried
out
i
have
killed
a
german
yet
he
said
bitterly
that
hard
lines
sir
that
is
the
spirit
of
my
men
i
made
many
good
friends
while
i
was
roaming
around
the
country
just
behind
the
front
i
wonder
how
many
of
them
i
shall
keep
how
many
of
them
death
will
spare
to
shake
my
hand
again
when
peace
is
restored
there
was
a
gordon
highlander
a
fine
young
officer
of
whom
i
became
particularly
fond
while
i
was
at
tramecourt
i
had
a
very
long
talk
with
him
and
i
thought
of
him
often
afterward
because
he
made
me
think
of
john
he
was
just
such
a
fine
young
type
of
briton
as
my
boy
had
been
months
later
when
i
was
back
in
britain
and
giving
a
performance
at
manchester
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
of
my
come
in
i
called
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
a
man
came
in
with
great
blue
glasses
covering
his
eyes
he
had
a
stick
and
he
groped
his
way
toward
me
i
did
not
know
him
at
all
at
first
and
then
suddenly
with
a
shock
i
recognized
him
as
my
fine
young
gordon
highlander
of
the
rest
billet
near
tramecourt
my
god
it
you
mac
i
said
deeply
shocked
yes
he
said
quietly
his
voice
had
changed
greatly
yes
i
harry
he
was
almost
totally
blind
and
he
did
not
know
whether
his
eyes
would
get
better
or
worse
do
you
remember
all
the
lads
you
met
at
the
billet
where
you
came
to
sing
for
us
the
first
time
i
met
you
harry
he
asked
me
well
they
all
gone
i
the
only
one
who
left
the
only
one
there
was
grief
in
his
voice
but
there
was
nothing
like
complaint
nor
was
there
nor
either
when
he
told
me
about
his
eyes
and
his
doubts
as
to
whether
he
would
ever
really
see
again
he
passed
his
own
troubles
off
lightly
as
if
they
did
not
matter
at
all
he
preferred
to
tell
me
about
those
of
his
friends
whom
i
had
met
and
to
give
me
the
story
of
how
this
one
and
that
one
had
gone
and
he
is
like
many
another
i
know
a
great
many
men
who
have
been
maimed
in
the
war
but
i
have
still
to
hear
one
of
them
complain
they
were
brave
enough
god
knows
in
battle
but
i
think
they
are
far
braver
when
they
come
home
shattered
and
smashed
and
do
naught
but
smile
at
their
troubles
the
only
sort
of
complaining
you
hear
from
british
soldiers
is
over
minor
discomforts
in
the
field
tommy
and
jock
will
grouse
when
they
are
so
disposed
they
will
growl
about
the
food
and
about
this
trivial
trouble
and
that
but
it
is
never
about
a
really
serious
matter
that
you
hear
them
talking
i
have
never
yet
met
a
man
who
had
been
permanently
disabled
who
was
not
grieving
because
he
could
not
go
back
and
it
is
strange
but
true
that
men
on
leave
get
homesick
for
the
trenches
sometimes
they
miss
the
companionships
they
have
had
in
the
trenches
i
think
it
must
be
because
all
the
best
men
in
the
world
are
in
france
that
they
feel
so
but
it
is
true
i
know
because
i
have
not
heard
it
once
but
a
dozen
times
men
will
dream
of
home
and
blighty
for
weeks
and
months
they
will
grouse
because
they
can
not
get
leave
though
half
the
time
they
have
not
even
asked
for
it
because
they
feel
that
their
place
is
where
the
fighting
is
and
then
when
they
do
get
that
leave
they
are
half
sorry
to
go
and
they
come
back
like
boys
coming
home
from
school
a
great
reward
awaits
the
men
who
fight
through
this
war
and
emerge
alive
and
triumphant
at
its
end
they
will
dictate
the
conduct
of
the
world
for
many
a
year
the
men
who
stayed
at
home
when
they
should
have
gone
may
as
well
prepare
to
drop
their
voices
to
a
very
low
whisper
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
for
the
men
who
will
be
heard
who
will
make
themselves
heard
are
out
there
in
france
chapter
xx
it
was
seven
in
the
morning
of
a
godly
and
a
beautiful
day
when
we
set
out
from
tramecourt
for
arras
arras
that
town
so
famous
now
in
british
history
and
in
the
annals
of
this
war
had
been
one
of
our
principal
objectives
from
the
outset
but
we
had
not
known
when
we
were
to
see
it
arras
had
been
the
pivot
of
the
great
northern
drive
in
the
spring
the
drive
that
hindenburg
had
fondly
supposed
he
had
spoiled
by
his
strategic
retreat
in
the
region
of
the
somme
begun
just
before
the
british
and
the
french
were
ready
to
attack
what
a
bonnie
morning
that
was
to
be
sure
the
sun
was
out
after
some
rainy
days
and
glad
we
all
were
to
see
it
the
land
was
sprayed
with
silver
light
the
air
was
as
sweet
and
as
soft
and
as
warm
as
a
baby
breath
and
the
cars
seemed
to
leap
forward
as
if
they
too
loved
the
day
and
the
air
they
ate
up
the
road
they
seemed
to
take
hold
of
its
long
smooth
surface
they
are
grand
roads
over
you
in
france
and
reel
it
up
in
underneath
their
wheels
as
if
it
were
a
tape
this
time
we
did
little
stopping
no
matter
how
good
the
reason
looked
we
went
hurtling
through
villages
and
towns
we
had
not
seen
before
our
horn
and
our
siren
shrieked
a
warning
as
we
shot
through
and
it
seemed
wrong
they
looked
so
peaceful
and
so
quiet
did
those
french
towns
on
that
summer
morning
peaceful
aye
and
languorous
after
all
the
bustle
and
haste
we
had
been
seeing
the
houses
were
set
in
pretty
encasements
of
bright
foliage
and
they
looked
as
though
they
had
been
painted
against
the
background
of
the
landscape
with
water
colors
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
war
had
passed
that
way
it
had
there
were
traces
everywhere
of
its
grim
visitation
but
here
its
heavy
hand
had
been
laid
lightly
upon
town
and
village
it
was
as
if
a
wave
of
poison
gas
of
the
sort
the
germans
brought
into
war
had
been
turned
aside
by
a
friendly
breeze
arising
in
the
very
nick
of
time
little
harm
had
been
done
along
the
road
we
traveled
but
the
thunder
of
the
guns
was
always
in
our
ears
we
could
hear
the
steady
throbbing
rhythm
of
the
cannon
muttering
away
to
the
north
and
east
it
was
very
warm
and
so
after
a
time
as
we
passed
through
a
village
someone
hogge
i
think
suggested
that
a
bottle
of
ginger
beer
all
around
would
not
be
amiss
the
idea
seemed
to
be
regarded
as
an
excellent
one
so
godfrey
spoke
to
the
chauffeur
beside
him
and
we
stopped
we
had
not
known
at
first
that
there
were
troops
in
town
but
there
were
highlanders
and
they
came
swarming
out
i
was
recognized
at
once
well
here
old
harry
lauder
cried
one
braw
laddie
come
on
harry
gie
us
a
song
they
shouted
let
have
in
the
gloamin
harry
gie
us
the
bonnie
lassie
we
ha
na
heard
laddies
who
fought
and
won
harry
they
tell
us
that
a
braw
song
we
were
not
really
supposed
to
give
any
roadside
concerts
that
day
but
how
was
i
to
resist
them
so
we
pulled
up
into
a
tiny
side
street
just
off
the
market
square
and
i
sang
several
songs
for
them
we
saved
time
by
not
unlimbering
the
wee
piano
and
i
sang
without
accompaniment
standing
up
in
the
car
but
they
seemed
to
be
as
well
pleased
as
though
i
had
had
the
orchestra
of
a
big
theater
to
support
me
and
all
the
accompaniments
and
trappings
of
the
stage
they
were
very
loath
to
let
me
go
and
i
do
know
how
much
time
we
really
saved
by
not
giving
our
full
and
regular
programme
for
before
i
had
done
they
had
me
telling
stories
too
captain
godfrey
was
smiling
but
he
was
glancing
at
his
watch
too
and
he
nudged
me
at
last
and
made
me
realize
that
it
was
time
for
us
to
go
on
no
matter
how
interesting
it
might
be
to
stay
i
be
good
i
promised
with
a
grin
as
we
drove
on
we
shall
go
straight
on
to
arras
now
but
we
did
not
we
met
a
bunch
of
engineers
on
the
road
after
a
space
and
they
looked
so
wistful
when
we
told
them
we
maun
be
getting
right
along
without
stopping
to
sing
for
them
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
disappoint
them
so
we
got
out
the
wee
piano
and
i
sang
them
a
few
songs
it
seemed
to
mean
so
much
to
those
boys
along
the
roads
i
think
they
enjoyed
the
concerts
even
more
than
did
the
great
gatherings
that
were
assembled
for
me
at
the
rest
camps
a
concert
was
more
of
a
surprise
for
them
more
of
a
treat
the
other
laddies
liked
them
too
aye
they
liked
them
fine
but
they
would
have
been
prepared
sometimes
they
would
have
been
looking
forward
to
the
fun
and
the
laddies
along
the
roads
took
them
as
a
man
takes
a
grand
bit
of
scenery
coming
before
his
eyes
suddenly
as
he
turns
a
bend
in
a
road
he
does
not
ken
as
for
myself
i
felt
that
i
was
becoming
quite
a
proficient
performer
by
now
my
voice
was
standing
the
strain
of
singing
under
such
novel
and
difficult
conditions
much
better
than
i
had
thought
it
could
and
i
saw
that
i
must
be
at
heart
and
by
nature
a
minstrel
i
know
i
got
more
pleasure
from
those
concerts
i
gave
as
a
minstrel
wandering
in
france
than
did
the
soldiers
or
any
of
those
who
heard
me
i
have
been
before
the
public
for
many
years
applause
has
always
been
sweet
to
me
it
is
to
any
artist
and
when
one
tells
you
it
is
not
you
may
set
it
down
in
your
hearts
that
he
or
she
is
telling
less
than
the
truth
it
is
the
breath
of
life
to
us
to
know
that
folks
are
pleased
by
what
we
do
for
them
why
else
would
we
go
on
about
our
tasks
i
have
had
much
applause
i
have
had
many
honors
i
have
told
you
about
that
great
and
overwhelming
reception
that
greeted
me
when
i
sailed
into
sydney
harbor
in
britain
in
america
i
have
had
greetings
that
have
brought
tears
into
my
eye
and
such
a
lump
into
my
throat
that
until
it
had
gone
down
i
could
not
sing
or
say
a
word
of
thanks
but
never
has
applause
sounded
so
sweet
to
me
as
it
did
along
those
dusty
roads
in
france
with
the
poppies
gleaming
red
and
the
cornflowers
blue
through
the
yellow
fields
of
grain
beside
the
roads
they
cheered
me
do
you
ken
those
tired
and
dusty
heroes
of
britain
along
the
french
roads
they
cheered
as
they
squatted
down
in
a
circle
about
us
me
in
my
kilt
and
johnson
tinkling
away
as
if
his
very
life
depended
upon
it
at
his
wee
piano
ah
those
wonderful
wonderful
soldiers
the
tears
come
into
my
eyes
and
my
heart
is
sore
and
heavy
within
me
when
i
think
that
mine
was
the
last
voice
many
of
them
ever
heard
lifted
in
song
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
trenches
so
many
of
those
laddies
who
stopped
for
a
song
along
the
road
and
when
men
are
going
into
the
trenches
they
know
and
all
who
see
them
passing
know
that
some
there
are
who
will
never
come
out
despite
all
the
interruptions
though
it
was
not
much
after
noon
when
we
reached
blangy
here
in
that
suburb
of
arras
were
the
headquarters
of
the
ninth
division
and
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
car
i
thrilled
to
the
knowledge
that
i
was
treading
ground
forever
to
be
famous
as
the
of
the
highland
brigade
in
the
attack
of
april
and
now
i
saw
arras
and
for
the
first
time
a
town
that
had
been
systematically
and
ruthlessly
shelled
there
are
no
words
in
any
tongue
i
know
to
give
you
a
fitting
picture
of
the
devastation
of
arras
awful
is
a
puny
word
a
thin
one
a
feeble
one
i
pick
impotently
at
the
of
my
imagination
when
i
try
to
frame
language
to
make
you
understand
what
it
was
i
saw
when
i
came
to
arras
on
that
bright
june
day
i
think
the
old
city
of
arras
should
never
be
rebuilt
i
doubt
if
it
can
be
rebuilt
indeed
but
i
think
that
whether
or
no
a
golden
fence
should
be
built
around
it
and
it
should
forever
and
for
all
time
be
preserved
as
a
monument
to
the
wanton
wickedness
of
the
hun
it
should
serve
and
stand
in
its
stark
desolation
as
a
tribute
dedicated
to
the
kultur
of
germany
no
painter
could
depict
the
frightfulness
of
that
city
of
the
dead
no
camera
could
make
you
see
as
it
is
only
your
eyes
can
do
that
for
you
and
even
then
you
can
not
realize
it
all
at
once
your
eyes
are
more
merciful
than
the
truth
and
the
hun
the
germans
shelled
arras
long
after
there
was
any
military
reason
for
doing
so
the
sheer
wanton
love
of
destruction
must
have
moved
them
they
had
destroyed
its
military
usefulness
but
still
they
poured
shot
and
shell
into
the
town
i
went
through
its
streets
the
germans
had
been
pushed
back
so
far
by
then
that
the
city
was
no
longer
under
steady
fire
but
they
had
done
their
work
nobody
was
living
in
arras
no
one
could
have
lived
there
the
houses
had
been
smashed
to
pieces
the
pavements
were
dust
and
rubble
but
there
was
life
in
the
city
through
the
ruins
our
men
moved
as
ceaselessly
and
as
restlessly
as
the
tenants
of
an
ant
hill
suddenly
upturned
by
a
plowshare
soldiers
were
everywhere
and
guns
guns
guns
for
arras
had
a
new
importance
now
it
was
a
center
for
many
roads
some
of
the
most
important
supply
roads
of
this
sector
of
the
front
converged
in
arras
trains
of
ammunition
trucks
supply
carts
and
wagons
of
all
sorts
great
trucks
laden
with
jam
and
meat
and
flour
all
were
passing
every
moment
there
was
an
incessant
din
of
horses
feet
and
the
steady
crunch
crunch
of
heavy
boots
as
the
soldiers
marched
through
the
rubble
and
the
brickdust
and
i
knew
that
all
this
had
gone
on
while
the
town
was
still
under
fire
indeed
even
now
an
occasional
shell
from
some
huge
gun
came
crashing
into
the
town
and
there
would
be
a
new
cloud
of
dust
arising
to
mark
its
landing
a
new
collapse
of
some
weakened
wall
warning
signs
were
everywhere
about
bidding
all
who
saw
them
to
beware
of
the
imminent
collapse
of
some
heap
of
masonry
i
saw
what
the
germans
had
left
of
the
stately
old
cathedral
and
of
the
famous
cloth
hall
one
of
the
very
finest
examples
of
the
guild
halls
of
medieval
times
goths
vandals
no
it
is
unfair
to
seek
such
names
for
the
germans
they
have
established
themselves
as
the
masters
of
all
time
in
brutality
and
in
destruction
there
is
no
need
to
call
them
anything
but
germans
the
cloth
hall
was
almost
human
in
its
pitiful
appeal
to
the
senses
and
the
imagination
the
german
fire
had
picked
it
to
pieces
so
that
it
stood
in
a
stark
outline
like
some
carcase
picked
bare
by
a
vulture
our
soldiers
who
were
quartered
nearby
lived
outside
the
town
in
huts
they
were
the
men
of
the
highland
brigade
and
the
ones
i
had
hoped
and
wished
above
all
others
to
meet
when
i
came
to
france
they
received
our
party
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
they
were
especially
flattering
when
they
greeted
me
one
of
the
highland
officers
took
me
in
hand
immediately
to
show
me
the
battlefield
the
ground
over
which
we
moved
had
literally
been
churned
by
it
was
neither
dirt
nor
mud
that
we
walked
upon
it
was
a
sort
of
powder
the
very
soil
had
been
decomposed
into
a
fine
dust
by
the
terrific
pounding
it
had
received
the
dust
rose
and
got
into
our
eyes
and
mouths
and
nostrils
there
was
a
lot
of
sneezing
among
the
members
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
that
day
at
arras
and
the
wire
it
was
strewn
in
every
direction
with
seeming
aimlessness
heavily
barbed
it
was
and
bad
stuff
to
get
caught
in
one
of
the
great
reasons
for
the
preliminary
bombardment
that
usually
precedes
an
attack
is
to
cut
this
wire
if
charging
men
are
caught
in
a
bad
tangle
of
wire
they
can
be
wiped
out
by
machine
before
they
can
get
clear
i
asked
a
highlander
one
day
how
long
he
thought
the
war
would
last
forty
years
he
said
never
batting
an
eyelid
we
be
fighting
another
year
and
then
it
tak
us
years
more
to
wind
up
all
the
wire
off
to
my
right
there
was
a
network
of
steel
strands
and
as
i
gazed
at
it
i
saw
a
small
dark
object
hanging
from
it
and
fluttering
in
the
breeze
i
was
curious
enough
to
go
over
and
i
picked
my
way
carefully
through
the
network
of
wire
to
see
what
it
might
be
when
i
came
close
i
saw
it
was
a
bit
of
cloth
and
immediately
i
recognized
the
tartan
of
the
black
watch
the
famous
mud
and
blood
held
that
bit
of
cloth
fastened
to
the
wire
as
if
by
a
cement
plainly
it
had
been
torn
from
a
kilt
i
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
that
bit
of
tartan
flapping
in
the
soft
summer
breeze
and
as
i
stood
i
could
look
out
and
over
the
landscape
dotted
with
a
very
forest
of
little
wooden
crosses
that
marked
the
last
of
the
men
who
had
charged
across
this
maze
of
wire
and
died
within
it
they
rose
did
those
rough
crosses
like
sheathed
swords
out
of
the
wild
luxurious
jungle
of
grass
that
had
grown
up
in
that
soil
i
wondered
if
the
owner
of
the
bit
of
tartan
were
still
safe
or
if
he
lay
under
one
of
the
crosses
that
i
saw
there
was
room
for
sad
speculation
here
who
had
he
been
had
he
swept
on
leaving
that
bit
of
his
kilt
as
evidence
of
his
passing
had
he
been
one
of
those
who
had
come
through
the
attack
gloriously
to
victory
so
that
he
could
look
back
upon
that
day
so
long
as
he
lived
or
was
he
dead
perhaps
within
a
hundred
yards
of
where
i
stood
and
gazed
down
at
that
relic
of
him
had
he
folks
at
hame
in
scotland
who
had
gone
through
days
of
anguish
on
his
account
such
days
of
anguish
as
i
had
known
illustration
berlin
struck
off
this
medal
when
the
lusitania
was
sunk
on
one
side
the
brutal
catastrophe
on
the
other
the
grinning
death
head
teutonically
exultant
and
so
now
i
preach
the
war
on
the
hun
my
own
way
says
harry
lauder
see
illustration
harry
lauder
laird
of
dunoon
see
i
asked
a
soldier
for
some
wire
clippers
and
i
cut
the
wire
on
either
side
of
that
bit
of
tartan
and
took
it
just
as
it
was
and
as
i
put
the
wee
bit
of
a
brave
man
kilt
away
i
kissed
the
tartan
for
auld
lang
syne
and
thought
of
what
a
tale
it
could
tell
if
it
could
only
speak
ha
ye
seen
a
the
men
frae
the
braes
and
the
glen
ha
ye
seen
them
a
marchin
awa
ha
ye
seen
a
the
men
frae
the
wee
and
the
gallants
frae
mansion
and
ha
i
have
said
before
that
i
do
not
want
to
tell
you
of
the
tales
of
atrocities
that
i
heard
in
france
i
heard
plenty
ayes
and
terrible
they
were
but
i
dinna
wish
to
harrow
the
feelings
of
those
who
read
more
than
i
need
and
i
will
leave
that
task
to
those
who
saw
for
themselves
with
their
eyes
when
i
had
but
my
ears
to
serve
me
yet
there
was
one
story
that
my
boy
john
told
to
me
and
that
the
finding
of
that
bit
of
black
watch
tartan
brings
to
my
mind
he
told
it
to
me
as
we
sat
before
the
fire
in
my
wee
hoose
at
dunoon
just
a
few
nights
before
he
went
back
to
the
front
for
the
last
time
we
were
talking
of
the
war
what
else
was
there
to
talk
aboot
it
was
seldom
that
john
touched
on
the
harsher
things
he
knew
about
the
war
he
preferred
as
a
rule
to
tell
me
stories
of
the
courage
and
the
devotion
of
his
men
and
of
the
light
way
that
they
turned
things
when
there
was
so
much
chance
for
grief
and
care
one
night
dad
he
said
we
had
a
battalion
of
the
black
watch
on
our
right
and
they
made
a
pretty
big
raid
on
the
german
trenches
it
developed
into
a
sizable
action
for
any
other
war
but
one
trifling
enough
and
unimportant
in
this
one
the
germans
had
been
readier
than
the
black
watch
had
supposed
and
had
reinforcements
ready
and
sixty
of
the
highlanders
were
captured
the
germans
took
them
back
into
their
trenches
and
stripped
them
to
the
skin
not
a
stitch
or
a
rag
of
clothing
did
they
leave
them
and
though
it
was
april
it
was
a
bitter
night
with
a
wind
to
cut
even
a
man
warmly
clad
to
the
bone
all
night
they
kept
them
there
standing
at
attention
stark
naked
so
that
they
were
when
the
gray
cold
light
of
the
dawn
began
to
show
behind
them
in
the
east
and
then
the
germans
laughed
and
told
their
prisoners
to
go
on
go
back
to
your
own
trenches
as
you
are
they
said
the
laddies
of
the
black
watch
could
scarcely
believe
their
ears
there
was
about
yards
between
the
two
trench
lines
at
that
point
and
the
no
man
land
was
rough
going
all
as
it
was
by
that
time
too
of
course
german
repair
parties
had
mended
all
the
wire
before
their
trenches
so
they
faced
a
rough
journey
all
naked
as
they
were
but
they
started
they
got
through
the
wire
with
the
germans
laughing
fit
to
kill
themselves
at
the
sight
of
the
streaks
of
blood
showing
on
their
white
skins
as
the
wire
got
in
its
work
they
laughed
at
them
dad
and
then
when
they
were
halfway
across
the
no
man
land
they
understood
at
last
why
the
germans
had
let
them
go
for
fire
was
opened
on
them
with
machine
guns
everyone
was
mowed
down
everyone
of
those
poor
naked
bleeding
lads
was
killed
murdered
by
that
treacherous
fire
from
behind
we
heard
all
the
details
of
that
dirty
bit
of
treachery
later
we
captured
some
german
prisoners
from
that
very
trench
fritz
is
a
decent
enough
sort
sometimes
and
there
were
men
there
whose
stomachs
were
turned
by
that
sight
so
that
they
were
glad
to
creep
over
later
and
surrender
they
told
us
with
tears
in
their
eyes
but
we
had
known
before
that
we
had
needed
no
witnesses
except
the
bodies
of
the
boys
it
had
been
too
dark
for
the
men
in
our
trenches
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
a
burst
of
machine
along
the
trenches
is
nothing
to
get
curious
or
excited
about
but
those
naked
bodies
lying
there
in
the
no
man
land
had
told
us
a
good
deal
dad
that
was
an
awful
sight
i
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
burying
parties
we
had
to
send
out
that
was
the
tale
i
thought
of
when
i
found
that
bit
of
the
black
watch
tartan
and
i
remembered
too
that
it
was
with
the
black
watch
that
john
poe
the
famous
american
football
player
from
princeton
met
his
death
in
a
charge
he
had
been
offered
a
commission
but
he
preferred
to
stay
with
the
boys
in
the
ranks
chapter
xxi
we
left
our
motor
cars
behind
us
in
arras
for
we
were
to
go
to
a
trench
and
the
climax
of
my
whole
trip
so
far
as
i
could
foresee
was
at
hand
johnson
and
the
wee
piano
had
to
stay
behind
too
we
could
not
expect
to
carry
even
so
tiny
an
instrument
as
that
into
a
trench
once
more
we
had
to
don
steel
helmets
but
there
was
a
great
difference
between
these
and
the
ones
we
had
had
at
vimy
ridge
mine
fitted
badly
and
kept
sliding
down
over
my
ears
or
else
slipping
way
down
to
the
back
of
my
head
it
must
have
given
me
a
grotesque
look
and
it
was
most
uncomfortable
so
i
decided
i
would
take
it
off
and
carry
it
for
a
while
you
better
keep
it
on
harry
captain
godfrey
advised
me
this
district
is
none
too
safe
even
right
here
and
it
gets
worse
as
we
go
along
a
whistling
percy
may
come
along
looking
for
you
any
minute
that
is
the
name
of
a
shell
that
is
good
enough
to
advertise
its
coming
by
a
whistling
shrieking
sound
i
could
hear
percies
whistling
all
around
and
see
them
spattering
up
the
ground
as
they
struck
not
so
far
away
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
coming
in
our
direction
so
i
decided
i
would
take
a
chance
well
i
said
as
i
took
the
steel
hat
off
i
just
keep
this
bonnet
handy
and
slip
it
on
if
i
see
percy
coming
but
later
i
was
mighty
glad
of
even
an
steel
helmet
several
staff
officers
from
the
highland
brigade
had
joined
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
by
now
affable
pleasant
gentlemen
they
were
and
very
eager
to
show
us
all
there
was
to
be
seen
and
they
had
more
sights
to
show
their
visitors
than
most
hosts
have
we
were
on
ground
now
that
had
been
held
by
the
germans
before
the
british
had
surged
forward
all
along
this
line
in
the
april
battle
their
old
trenches
abandoned
now
ran
like
deep
fissures
through
the
soil
they
had
been
pretty
well
blasted
to
pieces
by
the
british
bombardment
but
a
good
many
of
their
deep
concrete
dugouts
had
survived
these
were
not
being
used
by
the
british
here
but
were
saved
in
good
repair
as
show
places
and
the
officers
who
were
our
guides
took
us
down
into
some
of
them
rarely
comfortable
they
must
have
been
too
they
had
been
the
homes
of
german
officers
and
the
hun
officers
did
themselves
very
well
indeed
when
they
had
the
chance
they
had
electric
light
in
their
cave
houses
to
be
sure
they
had
used
german
wall
paper
and
atrociously
ugly
stuff
it
was
too
but
it
pleased
their
taste
no
doubt
mightily
amazed
some
of
fritz
officers
must
have
been
back
in
april
as
they
sat
and
took
their
ease
in
these
luxurious
quarters
to
have
jock
come
tumbling
in
upon
them
a
grenade
in
each
hand
our
men
might
have
used
these
dugouts
and
been
snug
enough
in
them
but
they
preferred
air
and
ventilation
and
lived
in
little
huts
above
the
ground
i
left
our
party
and
went
around
among
them
and
to
my
great
satisfaction
found
as
i
had
been
pretty
sure
i
would
a
number
of
old
acquaintances
and
old
admirers
who
came
crowding
around
me
to
shake
hands
i
made
a
great
collection
of
souvenirs
here
for
they
insisted
on
pressing
trophies
upon
me
tak
them
harry
said
one
after
another
we
can
get
plenty
more
where
they
came
from
one
laddie
gave
me
a
helmet
with
a
bullet
hole
through
the
skip
and
another
presented
me
with
one
of
the
most
interesting
souvenirs
of
all
i
carried
home
from
france
that
was
a
german
sniper
outfit
it
consisted
of
a
suit
of
overalls
waterproofed
if
a
man
had
it
on
he
would
be
completely
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
just
a
pair
of
slits
for
his
eyes
to
peep
out
of
and
another
for
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
breathe
it
was
cleverly
painted
the
color
of
a
tree
part
of
it
like
the
bark
part
green
like
leaves
sprouting
from
it
eh
jock
i
asked
the
laddie
who
gave
it
to
me
a
thing
like
hard
to
be
getting
i
thinking
oh
not
so
very
hard
he
answered
carelessly
you
got
to
be
a
good
shot
and
he
wore
medals
that
showed
he
was
all
you
got
to
do
harry
is
to
kill
the
chap
inside
it
before
he
kills
you
the
fellow
who
used
to
own
that
outfit
you
got
hid
himself
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
and
as
you
may
guess
he
looked
like
a
branch
of
the
tree
itself
he
was
pretty
hard
to
spot
but
i
got
suspicious
of
him
from
the
way
bullets
were
coming
over
steadily
and
i
decided
that
that
tree
hid
a
sniper
after
that
it
was
just
a
question
of
being
patient
it
was
no
so
long
before
i
was
sure
and
then
i
waited
until
i
saw
that
branch
move
as
no
branch
of
a
tree
ever
did
move
i
fired
then
and
got
him
he
was
away
outside
of
his
lines
and
that
nicht
i
slipped
out
and
brought
back
this
outfit
i
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
made
an
old
grizzled
sergeant
of
the
black
watch
gave
me
a
german
revolver
how
came
you
to
get
this
i
asked
him
it
was
an
acceedent
harry
he
said
we
were
raiding
a
trench
do
you
ken
and
i
was
in
a
sap
when
a
german
officer
came
along
and
we
bumped
into
one
another
he
looked
at
me
and
i
at
him
i
think
he
was
goin
to
say
something
but
i
dinna
ken
what
it
was
he
had
on
his
mind
that
his
revolver
you
got
in
your
hand
now
and
then
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
here
the
watch
he
used
to
carry
too
he
said
it
was
a
thick
affair
of
solid
gold
it
a
bit
too
big
but
it
a
rare
good
timekeeper
soon
after
that
an
officer
gave
me
another
trophy
that
is
perhaps
even
more
interesting
than
the
sniper
suit
it
is
rarer
at
least
it
is
a
small
bell
that
used
to
hang
in
a
wee
church
in
the
small
village
of
athies
on
the
scarpe
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
arras
the
germans
wiped
out
church
and
village
but
in
some
odd
way
they
found
the
bell
and
saved
it
they
hung
it
in
their
trenches
and
it
was
used
to
sound
a
gas
alarm
on
both
sides
a
signal
is
given
when
the
sentry
sees
that
there
is
to
be
a
gas
attack
in
order
that
the
men
may
have
time
to
don
the
clumsy
gas
masks
that
are
the
only
protection
against
the
deadly
fumes
the
wee
bell
is
eight
inches
high
maybe
and
i
have
never
heard
a
lovelier
tone
that
bell
has
rung
men
to
worship
and
it
has
rung
them
to
death
said
the
officer
who
gave
it
to
me
presently
i
was
called
back
to
my
party
after
i
had
spent
some
time
with
the
lads
in
their
huts
a
general
had
joined
the
party
now
and
he
told
me
with
a
smile
that
i
was
to
go
up
to
the
trenches
if
i
cared
to
do
so
i
will
not
say
i
was
not
a
bit
nervous
but
i
was
glad
to
go
for
a
that
it
was
the
thing
that
had
brought
me
to
france
after
a
so
we
started
and
by
now
i
was
glad
to
wear
my
steel
hat
fit
or
no
fit
i
was
to
give
an
entertainment
in
the
trenches
and
so
we
set
out
pretty
soon
i
was
climbing
a
steep
railroad
embankment
and
when
we
slid
down
on
the
other
side
we
found
the
trenches
wide
deep
gaps
in
the
earth
and
all
alive
with
men
we
got
into
the
trenches
themselves
by
means
of
ladders
and
the
soldiers
came
swarming
about
me
with
yells
of
hello
harry
welcome
harry
they
were
told
that
i
had
come
to
sing
for
them
and
so
with
no
further
preliminaries
i
began
my
concert
i
started
with
my
favorite
opening
song
as
usual
roamin
in
the
gloamin
and
then
went
on
with
the
other
old
favorites
i
told
a
lot
of
stories
too
and
then
i
came
to
the
laddies
who
fought
and
won
none
of
the
men
had
heard
it
but
there
were
officers
there
who
had
seen
three
cheers
during
the
winter
when
they
had
had
a
short
leave
to
run
over
to
london
i
got
through
the
first
verse
all
right
and
was
just
swinging
into
the
first
chorus
when
without
the
least
warning
hell
popped
open
in
that
trench
a
missile
came
in
that
some
officer
at
once
hailed
as
a
whizz
bang
it
is
called
that
for
that
is
just
exactly
the
sound
it
makes
it
is
like
a
giant
firecracker
and
it
would
be
amusing
if
one
did
not
know
it
was
deadly
these
missiles
are
not
fired
by
the
big
guns
behind
the
lines
but
by
the
small
trench
cannon
worked
as
a
rule
by
compressed
air
the
range
is
very
short
but
they
are
capable
of
great
execution
at
that
range
was
i
frightened
i
must
have
been
i
know
i
felt
a
good
deal
as
i
have
done
when
i
have
been
seasick
and
i
began
to
think
at
once
of
all
sorts
of
places
where
i
would
rather
have
been
than
in
that
trench
i
was
standing
on
a
slight
elevation
at
the
back
or
parados
of
the
trench
so
that
i
was
raised
a
bit
above
my
audience
and
i
had
a
fine
view
of
that
deadly
thing
wandering
about
spitting
fire
and
metal
parts
it
traveled
so
that
the
men
could
dodge
it
but
it
was
throwing
oft
slugs
that
you
could
neither
see
nor
dodge
and
it
was
a
poor
place
to
be
and
the
one
whizz
bang
was
not
enough
to
suit
fritz
it
was
followed
immediately
by
a
lot
more
that
came
popping
in
and
making
themselves
as
unpleasant
as
you
could
imagine
i
watched
the
men
about
me
and
they
seemed
to
be
unconcerned
and
to
be
thinking
much
more
of
me
and
my
singing
than
of
the
whizz
bangs
so
no
matter
how
i
felt
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
keep
on
with
my
song
i
decided
that
i
must
really
be
safe
enough
no
matter
how
i
felt
but
i
had
certain
misgivings
on
the
subject
still
i
managed
to
go
on
with
my
song
and
i
think
i
was
calm
enough
to
look
at
though
if
i
was
my
appearance
wholly
belied
my
true
inward
feelings
i
struggled
through
to
the
end
of
the
chorus
and
i
think
i
sang
pretty
badly
although
i
do
know
but
i
was
pretty
sure
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
for
me
and
that
these
laddies
were
taking
things
as
calmly
as
they
were
simply
because
they
were
used
to
it
and
it
was
all
in
the
day
work
for
them
the
germans
were
fairly
sluicing
that
trench
by
now
the
whizz
bangs
were
popping
over
us
like
giant
going
off
one
and
two
and
three
at
a
time
and
the
trench
was
full
of
flying
slugs
and
chunks
of
dirt
striking
against
our
faces
and
hurtling
all
about
us
there
i
was
i
had
a
good
house
i
wanted
to
please
my
audience
was
it
no
a
trying
situation
i
thought
fritz
might
have
had
manners
enough
to
wait
until
i
had
finished
my
concert
at
least
but
the
hun
has
no
manners
as
all
the
world
knows
along
that
embankment
we
had
climbed
to
reach
the
trenches
and
not
very
far
from
the
bit
of
trench
in
which
i
was
singing
there
was
a
railroad
bridge
of
some
strategic
importance
and
now
a
shell
hit
that
bridge
not
a
whizz
bang
but
a
real
big
shell
it
exploded
with
a
hideous
screech
as
if
the
bridge
were
some
human
thing
being
struck
and
screaming
out
its
agony
the
soldiers
looked
at
me
and
i
saw
some
of
them
winking
they
seemed
to
be
mighty
interested
in
the
way
i
was
taking
all
this
i
looked
back
at
them
and
then
at
a
highland
colonel
who
was
listening
to
my
singing
as
quietly
and
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
at
a
stall
in
covent
garden
during
the
opera
season
he
caught
my
glance
i
think
they
coming
it
a
bit
thick
lauder
old
chap
he
remarked
quietly
i
quite
agree
with
you
colonel
i
said
i
tried
to
ape
his
voice
and
manner
but
i
was
so
quiet
as
he
now
there
came
a
ripping
tearing
sound
in
the
air
and
a
veritable
cloudburst
of
the
damnable
whizz
bangs
broke
over
us
that
settled
matters
there
were
no
orders
but
everyone
turned
just
as
if
it
were
a
meeting
and
a
motion
to
adjourn
had
been
put
and
carried
unanimously
we
all
ran
for
the
safety
holes
or
dugouts
in
the
side
of
the
embankment
and
i
can
tell
ye
that
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
were
no
the
last
ones
to
reach
those
shelters
no
we
were
by
no
means
the
last
i
ha
no
doot
that
i
might
have
improved
upon
the
shelter
that
i
found
had
i
had
time
to
pick
and
choose
but
any
shelter
was
good
just
then
and
i
was
glad
of
mine
and
of
a
chance
to
catch
my
breath
afterward
i
saw
a
picture
by
captain
bairnsfather
that
made
me
laugh
a
good
deal
because
it
represented
so
exactly
the
way
i
felt
he
had
made
a
drawing
of
two
tommies
in
a
wee
bit
of
a
hole
in
a
field
that
was
being
swept
by
shells
and
missiles
of
every
sort
one
was
grousing
to
his
mate
and
the
other
said
to
him
if
you
know
a
better
go
in
it
i
said
we
all
turned
and
ran
for
cover
but
there
was
one
braw
laddie
who
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
would
not
run
such
tricks
were
not
for
him
he
was
a
big
laddie
and
he
wore
naught
but
his
kilt
and
his
semmet
his
undershirt
he
had
on
his
steel
helmet
and
it
shaded
a
face
that
had
not
been
shaved
or
washed
for
days
his
great
brawny
arms
were
folded
across
his
chest
and
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
he
stood
there
as
quiet
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
had
been
a
village
smith
gazing
down
a
quiet
country
road
i
watched
him
and
he
saw
me
and
grinned
at
me
and
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
me
quizzically
it
all
right
harry
he
said
several
times
dinna
fash
yoursel
man
i
tell
ye
in
time
for
ye
to
duck
if
i
see
one
coming
your
way
we
crouched
in
our
holes
until
there
came
a
brief
lull
in
the
bombardment
probably
the
germans
thought
they
had
killed
us
all
and
cleared
the
trench
or
maybe
it
had
been
only
that
they
had
liked
my
singing
and
had
been
satisfied
when
they
had
stopped
it
so
we
came
out
but
the
firing
was
not
over
at
all
as
we
found
out
at
once
so
we
went
down
a
bit
deeper
into
concrete
dugouts
this
trench
had
been
a
part
of
the
intricate
german
defensive
system
far
back
of
their
old
front
line
and
they
had
had
the
pains
of
building
and
hollowing
out
the
fine
dugout
into
which
i
now
went
for
shelter
here
they
had
lived
deep
under
the
earth
like
animals
and
with
animals
too
for
when
i
reached
the
bottom
a
dog
came
to
meet
me
sticking
out
his
red
tongue
to
lick
my
hand
and
wagging
his
tail
as
friendly
as
you
please
he
was
a
german
dog
one
of
the
prisoners
of
war
taken
in
the
great
attack
his
old
masters
had
bothered
to
call
him
and
take
him
with
them
when
the
highlanders
came
along
and
so
he
had
stayed
behind
as
part
of
the
spoils
of
the
attack
that
was
much
of
a
dog
as
dogs
go
he
was
a
creature
but
he
could
have
been
friendlier
the
highlanders
had
adopted
him
and
called
him
fritz
and
they
were
very
fond
of
him
and
he
of
them
he
had
no
thought
of
war
he
behaved
just
as
dogs
do
at
hame
but
above
us
the
horrid
din
was
still
going
on
and
bits
of
shells
were
flying
everywhere
anyone
of
them
enough
to
kill
you
if
it
struck
you
in
the
right
spot
i
was
glad
i
can
tell
ye
that
i
was
so
snug
and
safe
beneath
the
ground
and
i
had
no
mind
at
all
to
go
out
until
the
bombardment
was
well
over
i
knew
now
what
it
was
really
to
be
under
fire
the
casual
sort
of
shelling
i
had
had
to
fear
at
vimy
ridge
was
nothing
to
this
this
was
the
real
thing
and
then
i
thought
that
what
i
was
experiencing
for
a
few
minutes
was
the
daily
portion
of
these
laddies
who
were
all
aboot
me
not
for
a
few
minutes
but
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
at
a
time
and
it
came
home
to
me
again
and
stronger
than
ever
what
they
were
doing
for
us
folks
at
hame
and
how
we
ought
to
be
feeling
for
them
the
heavy
firing
went
on
for
of
an
hour
at
least
we
could
hear
the
chugging
of
the
big
guns
and
the
sorrowful
swishing
of
the
shells
as
if
they
were
mournful
because
they
were
not
wreaking
more
destruction
than
they
were
it
all
moved
me
greatly
but
i
could
see
that
the
soldiers
thought
nothing
of
it
and
were
quite
unperturbed
by
the
fearful
demonstration
that
was
going
on
above
they
smoked
and
chatted
and
my
own
nerves
grew
calmer
finally
there
seemed
to
come
a
real
lull
in
the
row
above
and
i
turned
to
the
general
is
it
near
time
for
me
to
be
finishing
my
concert
sir
i
asked
him
very
good
he
said
jumping
up
just
as
you
say
lauder
so
back
we
went
to
where
i
had
begun
to
sing
my
audience
reassembled
and
i
struck
up
the
laddies
who
fought
and
won
again
it
seemed
somehow
the
most
appropriate
song
i
could
have
picked
to
sing
in
that
spot
i
finished
this
time
but
there
was
some
discord
in
the
closing
bars
for
the
germans
were
still
at
their
shelling
sporadically
so
i
finished
and
i
said
to
the
men
who
were
to
stay
in
the
trench
guarding
that
bit
of
britain
far
flung
battleline
and
then
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
was
ready
to
go
back
not
to
safety
at
once
but
to
a
region
far
less
infested
by
the
hun
than
this
one
where
we
had
been
such
warmly
received
visitors
chapter
xxii
i
was
sorry
to
be
leaving
the
highland
laddies
in
that
trench
aye
but
for
the
trench
itself
i
had
nae
regrets
nae
none
whatever
i
know
no
spot
on
the
surface
of
this
earth
of
all
that
i
have
visited
and
i
have
been
in
many
climes
that
struck
me
as
less
salubrious
than
you
bit
o
trench
there
were
too
many
other
visitors
there
that
day
along
with
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
they
were
braw
laddies
yo
but
no
what
you
might
call
about
the
company
they
kept
i
thank
them
if
be
havin
me
to
veesit
them
again
to
let
me
come
by
my
ain
getting
away
was
not
the
safest
business
in
the
world
either
although
it
was
better
than
staying
in
yon
trench
we
had
to
make
our
way
back
to
the
railway
embankment
and
along
it
for
a
space
and
the
embankment
was
being
heavily
shelled
it
was
really
a
trench
line
itself
full
of
dugouts
and
as
we
made
our
way
along
heads
popped
in
all
directions
topped
by
steel
helmets
i
was
eager
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
you
embankment
although
i
knew
well
enough
that
there
was
no
sanctuary
on
either
side
of
it
nor
for
a
long
space
behind
it
that
was
what
they
called
the
frenchy
railway
cutting
and
it
overlooked
the
ruined
village
of
athies
and
not
until
after
i
had
crossed
it
was
i
breathing
properly
i
began
then
to
feel
more
like
myself
and
my
heart
and
all
my
functions
began
to
be
more
normal
all
this
region
we
had
to
cross
now
was
still
under
fire
but
the
fire
was
nothing
to
what
it
had
been
the
evidences
of
the
terrific
bombardments
there
had
been
were
plainly
to
be
seen
every
scrap
of
exposed
ground
had
been
nicked
by
shells
the
holes
were
as
close
together
as
those
in
a
honeycomb
i
could
not
see
how
any
living
thing
had
come
through
that
hell
of
fire
but
many
men
had
now
the
embankment
fairly
buzzed
with
activity
the
dugouts
were
everywhere
and
the
way
the
helmeted
heads
popped
out
as
we
passed
inquiringly
made
me
think
of
the
prairie
dog
towns
i
had
seen
in
canada
and
the
western
united
states
the
river
scarpe
flowed
close
by
it
was
a
narrow
sluggish
stream
and
it
did
not
look
to
me
worthy
of
its
famous
name
but
often
that
spring
its
waters
had
been
flecked
by
a
bloody
froth
and
the
bodies
of
brave
men
had
been
hidden
by
them
and
washed
clean
of
the
trench
mud
now
uninviting
as
its
aspect
was
and
sinister
as
were
the
memories
it
must
have
evoked
in
other
hearts
beside
my
own
it
was
water
and
on
so
hot
a
day
water
was
a
precious
thing
to
men
who
had
been
working
as
the
laddies
hereabout
had
worked
and
labored
so
either
bank
was
dotted
with
naked
bodies
and
the
stream
itself
showed
head
after
head
and
flashing
white
arms
as
men
went
swimming
some
were
scrubbing
themselves
taking
a
briton
keen
delight
in
a
bath
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
in
which
he
gets
it
others
were
washing
their
clothes
slapping
and
pounding
the
soaked
garments
in
a
way
to
have
wrung
the
hearts
of
their
wives
had
they
seen
them
at
it
the
british
soldier
in
the
field
does
many
things
for
himself
that
folks
at
hame
never
think
of
but
many
of
the
men
were
just
lying
on
the
bank
sprawled
out
and
sunning
themselves
like
alligators
basking
in
the
warm
sunshine
and
soaking
up
rest
and
good
cheer
it
looked
like
a
good
place
for
a
concert
and
so
i
quickly
gathered
an
audience
of
about
a
thousand
men
from
the
dugouts
in
the
embankment
and
obeyed
their
injunctions
to
go
it
harry
gie
us
a
song
do
now
as
i
finished
my
first
song
my
audience
applauded
me
and
cheered
me
most
heartily
and
the
laddies
along
the
banks
of
the
scarpe
heard
them
and
came
running
up
to
see
what
was
afoot
there
were
no
ladies
thereabout
and
they
did
not
stand
on
a
small
matter
like
getting
dressed
not
they
they
came
running
just
as
they
were
and
adam
garbed
in
his
fig
leaf
was
fully
clad
compared
to
most
of
them
it
was
the
barest
gallery
i
ever
saw
and
the
noisiest
too
and
the
most
truly
appreciative
high
up
above
us
airplanes
were
circling
so
high
that
we
could
not
tell
from
which
side
they
came
except
when
we
saw
some
of
them
being
shelled
and
so
knew
that
they
belonged
to
fritz
they
looked
like
black
pinheads
against
the
blue
cushion
of
the
sky
and
no
doubt
that
they
were
vastly
puzzled
as
to
the
reason
of
this
gathering
of
naked
men
what
new
tricks
were
the
damned
english
up
to
now
so
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
wondering
it
was
the
business
of
their
observers
of
course
to
spot
just
such
gatherings
as
ours
although
i
did
not
think
of
that
just
then
except
to
think
that
they
might
drop
a
bomb
or
two
maybe
but
scouting
airplanes
such
as
those
were
do
not
go
in
for
bomb
dropping
there
are
three
sorts
of
airplanes
first
come
the
scouting
planes
fairly
fast
good
climbers
able
to
stay
in
the
air
a
long
time
their
business
is
just
to
spy
out
the
lay
of
the
land
over
the
enemy
trenches
not
to
fight
or
drop
bombs
then
come
the
swift
powerful
bombing
planes
which
make
raids
flying
long
distances
to
do
so
the
huns
use
such
planes
to
bomb
unprotected
towns
and
kill
women
and
babies
ours
go
in
for
bombing
ammunition
dumps
and
trains
and
railway
stations
and
other
places
of
military
importance
although
by
now
they
may
be
indulging
in
reprisals
for
some
of
fritz
murderous
raids
as
so
many
folk
at
hame
in
britain
have
prayed
they
would
both
scouting
and
bombing
planes
are
protected
by
the
fastest
flyers
of
all
the
battle
planes
as
they
are
called
these
fight
other
planes
in
the
air
and
it
is
the
men
who
steer
them
and
fight
their
guns
who
perform
the
heroic
exploits
that
you
may
read
of
every
day
but
much
of
the
great
work
in
the
air
is
done
by
the
scouting
planes
which
take
desperate
chances
and
find
it
hard
to
fight
back
when
they
are
attacked
and
it
was
scouts
who
were
above
us
now
and
doubtless
sending
word
back
by
wireless
of
a
new
and
mysterious
concentration
of
british
forces
along
the
scarpe
which
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
the
hun
artillery
to
strafe
a
bit
so
before
very
long
a
rude
interruption
came
to
my
songs
in
the
way
of
shells
dropped
unpleasantly
close
the
men
so
far
above
us
had
given
their
guns
the
range
and
so
although
the
gunners
could
not
see
us
they
could
make
their
presence
felt
i
have
never
been
booed
or
hissed
by
an
audience
since
i
have
been
on
the
stage
i
understand
that
it
is
a
terrible
and
a
disconcerting
experience
and
one
calculated
to
play
havoc
with
the
stoutest
of
nerves
it
is
an
experience
i
am
by
no
means
anxious
to
have
i
can
tell
you
but
i
doubt
if
it
could
seem
worse
to
me
than
the
interruption
of
a
shell
the
germans
that
day
showed
no
ear
for
music
and
no
appreciation
of
art
my
art
at
least
and
so
it
seemed
well
to
me
to
cut
my
programme
to
a
certain
extent
at
least
and
bid
farewell
to
my
audience
dressed
and
undressed
it
was
a
performance
at
which
it
did
not
seem
to
me
a
good
idea
to
take
any
curtain
calls
i
did
not
miss
them
nor
feel
slighted
because
they
were
absent
i
was
too
glad
to
get
away
with
a
whole
skin
the
shelling
became
very
furious
now
plainly
the
germans
meant
to
take
no
chances
they
could
guess
what
the
gathering
their
airplanes
had
observed
might
portend
but
if
they
could
they
meant
to
defeat
its
object
whatever
that
might
be
well
they
did
not
succeed
but
they
probably
had
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
they
had
and
i
for
one
do
not
begrudge
them
that
they
forced
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
to
make
a
pretty
wide
detour
away
from
the
river
to
get
back
to
the
main
road
but
they
fired
a
power
of
shells
to
do
so
when
we
finally
reached
the
road
i
heard
a
mad
sputtering
behind
i
looked
around
in
alarm
because
it
sounded
for
all
the
world
like
one
of
those
infernal
whizz
bangs
chasing
me
but
it
was
not
the
noise
came
from
a
motor
cycle
and
its
rider
dashed
up
to
me
and
dropped
one
foot
to
the
ground
here
a
letter
for
you
harry
he
said
it
was
a
package
that
he
handed
me
i
was
surprised
i
was
not
expecting
to
have
a
post
delivered
to
me
on
the
battlefield
of
arras
it
turned
out
that
the
package
contained
a
couple
of
bits
of
shell
and
a
letter
from
my
friends
the
highlanders
on
the
other
side
of
the
railway
embankment
they
wrote
to
thank
me
for
singing
for
them
and
said
they
hoped
i
was
none
the
worse
for
the
bombardment
i
had
undergone
these
bits
of
metal
are
from
the
shell
that
was
closest
to
you
when
it
burst
their
spokesman
wrote
they
nearly
got
you
and
we
thought
you
like
to
have
them
to
keep
for
souvenirs
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
was
a
singularly
calm
and
phlegmatic
letter
my
nerves
were
a
good
deal
overwrought
as
i
can
see
now
now
we
made
our
way
slowly
back
to
division
headquarters
and
there
i
found
that
preparations
had
been
made
for
very
much
the
most
ambitious
and
pretentious
concert
that
i
had
yet
had
a
chance
to
give
in
france
there
was
a
very
large
audience
and
a
stage
or
platform
had
been
set
up
with
plenty
of
room
on
it
for
johnson
and
his
piano
it
had
been
built
in
a
great
field
and
all
around
me
when
i
mounted
it
i
could
see
kilted
soldiers
almost
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
there
were
many
thousands
of
them
there
indeed
all
of
the
highland
brigade
that
was
not
actually
on
duty
at
the
moment
was
present
and
a
good
many
other
men
beside
for
good
measure
here
was
a
sight
to
make
a
scots
heart
leap
with
pride
here
before
me
was
the
flower
of
scottish
manhood
these
regiments
had
been
through
a
series
of
battles
not
so
long
since
that
had
sadly
thinned
their
ranks
many
a
scottish
grave
had
been
filled
that
spring
many
a
scottish
heart
at
hame
had
been
broken
by
sad
news
from
this
spot
but
there
they
were
now
before
me
their
ranks
filled
up
again
splendid
as
they
stretched
out
eager
to
welcome
me
and
cheer
me
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
as
i
looked
around
at
them
massed
before
me
were
all
the
best
men
scotland
had
had
to
offer
all
these
men
had
breathed
deep
of
the
hellish
air
of
war
all
had
marched
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
skirt
to
skirt
with
death
all
were
of
my
country
and
my
people
my
heart
was
big
within
me
with
pride
of
them
and
that
i
was
of
their
race
as
i
stood
up
to
sing
for
them
johnson
was
waiting
for
me
to
be
ready
little
tinkle
tom
as
we
called
the
wee
piano
was
not
very
large
but
there
were
times
when
he
had
to
be
left
behind
i
think
he
was
glad
to
have
us
back
again
and
to
be
doing
his
part
instead
of
leaving
me
to
sing
alone
without
his
stout
help
many
distinguished
officers
were
in
that
great
assemblage
they
all
turned
out
to
hear
me
as
well
as
the
men
and
among
them
i
saw
many
familiar
faces
and
old
friends
from
hame
but
there
were
many
faces
too
alas
that
i
did
not
see
and
when
i
inquired
for
them
later
i
learned
that
many
of
them
i
had
seen
for
the
last
time
oh
the
sad
news
i
learned
day
after
day
oot
there
in
france
friend
after
friend
of
whom
i
made
inquiry
was
known
to
be
sure
they
could
tell
me
where
and
when
and
how
they
had
been
killed
up
above
us
as
i
began
to
sing
our
airplanes
were
circling
no
boche
planes
were
in
sight
now
i
had
been
told
but
there
were
many
of
ours
and
sometimes
one
came
swooping
down
its
occupants
curious
no
doubt
as
to
what
might
be
going
on
and
the
hum
of
its
huge
propeller
would
make
me
falter
a
bit
in
my
song
and
once
or
twice
one
flew
so
low
and
so
close
that
i
was
almost
afraid
it
would
strike
me
and
i
would
dodge
in
what
i
think
was
mock
alarm
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
soldiers
i
had
given
them
two
songs
when
a
big
man
arose
far
back
in
the
crowd
he
was
a
long
way
from
me
but
his
great
voice
carried
to
me
easily
so
that
i
could
hear
every
word
he
said
harry
he
shouted
sing
us
wee
hoose
amang
the
heather
and
we
a
join
in
the
chorus
for
a
moment
i
could
only
stare
out
at
them
between
that
sea
of
faces
upraised
to
mine
and
my
eyes
there
came
another
face
the
smiling
bonnie
face
of
my
boy
john
that
i
should
never
see
again
with
mortal
eyes
that
had
been
one
of
his
favorite
songs
for
many
years
i
hesitated
it
was
as
if
a
gentle
hand
had
plucked
at
my
very
heart
strings
and
played
upon
them
memory
memories
of
my
boy
swept
over
me
in
a
flood
i
felt
a
choking
in
my
throat
and
the
tears
welled
into
my
eyes
but
then
i
began
to
sing
making
a
signal
to
johnson
to
let
me
sing
alone
and
when
i
came
to
the
chorus
true
to
the
big
promise
they
all
did
join
in
the
chorus
and
what
a
chorus
that
was
thousands
of
men
were
singing
there
a
wee
hoose
amang
the
heather
there
a
wee
hoose
the
sea
there
a
lassie
in
that
wee
hoose
waiting
patiently
for
me
she
the
picture
of
perfection
i
would
na
tell
a
lee
if
ye
saw
her
ye
would
love
her
just
the
same
as
me
my
voice
was
very
shaky
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
that
chorus
but
the
great
wave
of
sound
from
the
kilted
laddies
rolled
out
true
and
full
unshaken
unbroken
they
carried
the
air
as
steadily
as
a
ship
is
carried
upon
a
rolling
sea
i
could
sing
no
more
for
them
and
then
as
i
made
my
way
unsteadily
enough
from
the
platform
music
struck
up
that
was
the
sweetest
i
could
have
heard
some
pipers
had
come
together
from
twa
or
three
regiments
unknown
to
me
and
now
very
softly
their
pipes
began
to
skirl
they
played
the
tune
that
i
love
best
the
drunken
piper
i
could
scarcely
see
to
pick
my
way
for
the
tears
that
blinded
me
but
in
my
ears
as
i
passed
away
from
them
there
came
gently
wailing
on
the
pipes
the
plaintive
plea
will
ye
no
come
back
again
chapter
xxiii
now
it
was
time
to
take
to
the
motor
cars
again
and
i
was
glad
of
the
thought
that
we
would
have
a
bracing
ride
i
needed
something
of
the
sort
i
thought
my
emotions
had
been
deeply
stirred
in
many
ways
that
day
i
felt
tired
and
quite
exhausted
this
was
by
all
odds
the
most
strenuous
day
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
had
put
in
yet
in
france
so
i
welcomed
the
idea
of
sitting
back
comfortably
in
the
car
and
feeling
the
cool
wind
against
my
cheeks
first
however
the
entertainers
were
to
be
entertained
they
took
us
the
officers
of
the
divisional
staff
to
a
hut
where
we
were
offered
our
choice
of
tea
or
a
wee
hauf
yin
there
was
good
scots
whisky
there
but
it
was
the
tea
i
wanted
it
was
very
hot
in
the
sun
and
i
had
done
a
deal
of
clambering
about
so
i
was
glad
after
all
to
stay
in
the
shade
a
while
and
rest
my
limbs
getting
out
through
arras
turned
out
to
be
a
ticklish
business
the
germans
were
verra
wasteful
o
their
shells
that
day
considering
how
much
siller
they
cost
they
were
pounding
away
and
more
shells
by
a
good
many
were
falling
in
arras
than
had
been
the
case
when
we
arrived
at
noon
so
i
got
a
chance
to
see
how
the
ruin
that
had
been
wrought
had
been
accomplished
arras
is
a
wonderful
sight
noble
and
impressive
even
in
its
destruction
but
it
was
a
sight
that
depressed
me
it
had
angered
me
at
first
but
now
i
began
to
think
at
each
ruined
house
that
i
saw
suppose
this
were
at
hame
in
scotland
and
when
such
thoughts
came
to
me
i
thanked
god
for
the
brave
lads
i
had
seen
that
day
who
stood
out
here
holding
the
line
and
so
formed
a
bulwark
between
scotland
and
such
black
ruin
as
this
we
were
to
start
for
tramecourt
now
but
on
the
way
we
were
to
make
a
couple
of
stops
our
way
was
to
take
us
through
pol
and
hesdin
and
going
so
we
came
to
the
town
of
le
quesnoy
here
some
of
the
argyle
and
sutherland
highlanders
were
stationed
my
heart
leaped
at
the
sight
of
them
that
had
been
my
boy
regiment
although
he
had
belonged
to
a
different
battalion
and
it
was
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
that
i
called
a
halt
and
gave
them
a
concert
i
gave
two
more
concerts
both
brief
ones
on
the
rest
of
the
journey
and
so
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
approached
the
chateau
at
tramecourt
as
we
came
up
i
became
aware
of
a
great
stir
and
movement
that
was
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
there
in
the
grounds
i
could
see
tiny
lights
moving
about
like
fireflies
lights
that
came
i
thought
from
electric
torches
something
extraordinary
must
be
going
on
here
i
remarked
to
captain
godfrey
i
wonder
if
general
haig
has
arrived
by
any
chance
we
soon
know
what
it
all
about
he
said
philosophically
but
i
expect
he
knew
already
before
the
chateau
there
was
a
brilliant
spot
of
light
standing
out
vividly
against
the
surrounding
darkness
i
could
not
account
for
that
brilliantly
lighted
spot
then
but
we
came
into
it
as
the
car
stopped
it
was
a
sort
of
oasis
of
light
in
an
inky
desert
of
surrounding
gloom
and
as
we
came
full
into
it
and
i
stood
up
to
descend
from
the
car
stretching
my
tired
stiff
legs
the
silence
and
the
darkness
were
split
by
three
tremendous
cheers
it
was
general
haig
who
was
arriving
it
was
harry
lauder
what
the
matter
here
i
called
as
loudly
as
i
could
been
waitin
for
ye
a
couple
of
called
a
loud
cockney
voice
in
answer
go
it
now
get
it
off
your
chest
then
came
explanations
it
seemed
that
a
lot
of
soldiers
about
four
hundred
strong
who
were
working
on
a
big
road
job
about
ten
miles
from
tramecourt
had
heard
of
my
being
there
and
had
decided
to
come
over
in
a
body
and
beg
for
a
concert
they
got
to
the
chateau
early
and
were
told
it
might
be
eleven
before
i
got
back
but
they
care
they
said
they
wait
all
night
if
they
had
to
to
get
a
chance
to
hear
me
and
they
made
some
use
of
the
time
they
had
to
wait
they
took
three
big
acetylene
headlights
from
motor
cars
and
connected
them
up
there
was
a
little
porch
at
the
entrance
of
the
chateau
with
a
short
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
it
and
then
we
decided
that
that
would
make
an
excellent
makeshift
theater
since
it
would
be
dark
they
decided
they
must
have
lights
so
that
they
could
see
me
just
as
in
a
regular
theater
at
hame
that
was
where
the
headlights
they
borrowed
from
motor
cars
came
in
they
put
one
on
each
side
of
the
porch
and
one
off
in
front
so
that
all
the
light
was
centered
right
on
the
porch
itself
and
it
was
bathed
in
as
strong
a
glare
as
ever
i
sang
in
on
the
stage
it
was
almost
blinding
indeed
as
i
found
when
i
turned
to
face
them
and
to
sing
for
them
needless
to
say
late
though
it
was
and
tired
as
i
was
i
never
thought
of
refusing
to
give
them
the
concert
they
wanted
i
should
have
liked
to
eat
my
dinner
first
but
i
could
think
of
suggesting
it
these
boys
had
done
a
long
hard
day
work
then
they
had
marched
ten
miles
and
on
top
of
all
that
had
waited
two
hours
for
me
and
fixed
up
a
stage
and
a
lighting
system
they
were
quite
as
tired
as
i
i
decided
and
they
had
done
a
lot
more
and
so
i
told
the
faithful
johnson
to
bring
wee
tinkle
tom
along
and
get
him
up
to
the
little
stage
and
i
faced
my
audience
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
of
the
ghostliest
applause
i
ever
hope
to
hear
i
could
hear
them
do
you
ken
but
i
could
no
see
a
face
before
me
in
the
theater
bright
though
the
footlights
are
and
greatly
as
they
dim
what
lies
beyond
them
you
can
still
see
the
white
faces
of
your
audience
at
least
you
do
see
something
your
eyes
help
you
to
know
the
audience
is
there
and
gradually
you
can
see
perfectly
and
pick
out
a
face
maybe
and
sing
to
some
one
person
in
the
audience
that
you
may
be
sure
of
your
effects
it
was
utter
stygian
darkness
that
lay
beyond
the
pool
of
blinding
light
in
which
i
stood
gradually
i
did
make
out
a
little
of
what
lay
beyond
very
close
to
me
i
could
see
dim
outlines
of
human
bodies
moving
around
and
now
i
was
sure
there
were
fireflies
about
but
then
they
stayed
so
still
that
i
realized
suddenly
with
a
smile
just
what
they
were
the
glowing
ends
of
cigarettes
of
course
there
were
many
tall
poplar
trees
around
the
chateau
i
knew
where
to
look
for
them
but
that
night
i
could
scarcely
see
them
i
tried
to
find
them
for
it
was
a
strange
weird
sensation
to
be
there
as
i
was
and
i
wanted
all
the
help
fixed
objects
could
give
me
i
managed
to
pick
out
their
feathery
lines
in
the
black
distance
the
darkness
made
them
seem
more
remote
than
they
were
really
their
branches
when
i
found
them
waved
like
spirit
arms
and
i
could
hear
the
wind
whispering
and
sighing
among
the
topmost
branches
now
and
then
what
we
call
in
scotland
a
batty
bird
skimmed
past
my
face
attracted
i
suppose
by
the
bright
light
i
suppose
that
bats
that
have
not
been
disturbed
before
for
generations
have
been
aroused
by
the
blast
of
war
through
all
that
region
and
have
come
out
of
dark
cavernous
as
those
that
night
must
have
done
to
see
what
it
is
all
about
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
they
were
verra
disconcertin
those
bats
they
bothered
me
almost
as
much
as
the
whizz
bangs
had
done
earlier
in
the
day
they
swished
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
against
my
face
and
i
would
start
back
and
hear
a
ripple
of
laughter
run
through
that
unseen
audience
of
mine
aye
it
was
verra
funny
for
them
but
i
did
not
like
that
part
of
it
a
bit
no
man
likes
to
have
a
bat
touch
his
skin
and
i
had
to
duck
quickly
to
evade
those
winged
cousins
of
the
mouse
and
then
hear
a
soft
guffaw
arising
as
i
did
it
i
have
appeared
sometimes
in
theaters
in
which
it
was
pretty
difficult
to
find
the
audience
and
such
audiences
have
been
nearly
impossible
to
trace
later
in
the
reports
but
that
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
up
to
now
the
last
that
i
ever
sang
to
a
totally
invisible
audience
i
did
not
know
then
how
many
men
there
might
have
been
forty
or
four
hundred
or
four
thousand
and
save
for
the
titters
that
greeted
my
encounters
with
the
bats
they
were
amazingly
quiet
as
they
waited
for
me
to
sing
it
was
just
about
ten
minutes
before
eleven
when
i
began
to
sing
and
the
concert
was
over
until
after
midnight
i
was
distinctly
nervous
as
i
began
the
verse
of
my
first
song
it
was
a
great
relief
when
there
was
a
round
of
applause
that
helped
to
place
my
audience
and
give
me
its
measure
at
once
but
i
was
almost
as
disconcerted
a
bit
later
as
i
had
been
by
the
first
incursion
of
the
bats
i
came
to
the
chorus
and
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
there
came
a
perfect
gale
of
sound
it
was
the
men
taking
up
the
chorus
thundering
it
out
they
took
the
song
clean
away
from
me
i
could
only
gasp
and
listen
the
roar
from
that
unseen
chorus
almost
took
my
feet
from
under
me
so
amazing
was
it
and
so
unexpected
somehow
used
as
i
was
to
having
soldiers
join
in
a
chorus
with
me
and
disappointed
as
i
should
have
been
had
they
ever
failed
to
do
so
but
after
that
first
song
when
i
knew
what
to
expect
i
soon
grew
used
to
the
strange
surroundings
the
weirdness
and
the
mystery
wore
off
and
i
began
to
enjoy
myself
tremendously
the
conditions
were
simply
ideal
indeed
they
were
perfect
for
the
sentimental
songs
that
soldiers
always
like
best
imagine
how
roamin
in
the
gloamin
went
that
nicht
i
had
meant
to
sing
three
or
four
songs
but
instead
i
sang
nearly
every
song
i
knew
it
was
one
of
the
longest
programmes
i
gave
during
the
whole
tour
and
i
enjoyed
the
concert
myself
better
than
any
i
had
yet
given
my
audience
was
growing
all
the
time
although
i
did
not
know
that
the
singing
brought
up
crowds
from
the
french
village
who
gathered
in
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
to
listen
and
i
make
no
doubt
to
pass
amazed
comments
on
these
queer
english
at
last
i
was
too
tired
to
go
on
and
so
i
bade
the
lads
and
they
gave
me
a
great
cheer
and
faded
away
into
the
blackness
and
i
went
inside
rubbing
my
eyes
and
wondering
if
it
was
no
all
a
dream
it
was
sir
douglas
haig
who
arrived
was
it
harry
godfrey
said
slyly
chapter
xxiv
the
next
morning
i
was
tired
as
you
may
believe
i
ached
in
every
limb
when
i
went
to
my
room
that
night
but
a
hot
bath
and
a
good
sleep
did
wonders
for
me
no
bombardment
could
have
kept
me
awake
that
nicht
i
would
no
ha
cared
had
the
hun
begun
shelling
tramecourt
itself
so
long
as
he
did
not
shell
me
clear
out
of
my
bed
still
in
the
morning
though
i
had
not
had
so
much
sleep
as
i
would
have
liked
i
was
ready
to
go
when
we
got
the
word
we
made
about
as
early
a
start
as
usual
breakfast
soon
after
daylight
and
then
out
the
motor
cars
and
to
wee
tinkle
tom
our
destination
that
day
our
first
at
least
was
albert
a
town
as
badly
smashed
and
battered
as
arras
or
ypres
these
towns
were
long
thinly
held
by
the
british
that
is
they
were
just
within
our
lines
and
the
hun
could
rake
them
with
his
fire
at
his
own
evil
will
it
did
him
no
good
to
batter
them
to
pieces
as
he
did
he
wasted
shells
upon
them
that
must
have
been
precious
to
him
his
treatment
of
them
was
but
a
part
of
his
wicked
wanton
spirit
of
destructiveness
he
could
not
see
a
place
standing
that
he
did
not
want
to
destroy
i
think
it
was
not
war
he
made
as
the
world
had
known
war
it
was
a
savage
raid
against
every
sign
and
evidence
of
civilization
and
comfort
and
happiness
but
always
as
i
think
i
have
said
before
one
thing
eluded
him
it
was
the
soul
of
that
which
he
destroyed
that
was
beyond
his
reach
and
sore
it
must
have
grieved
him
to
come
to
know
it
for
come
to
know
it
he
has
in
france
and
in
belgium
too
we
passed
through
a
wee
town
called
doullens
on
our
way
from
tramecourt
to
albert
and
there
that
morn
i
saw
an
old
french
nun
an
aged
woman
a
woman
old
beyond
all
belief
or
reckoning
i
think
she
is
still
there
where
i
saw
her
that
day
indeed
it
has
seemed
to
me
often
as
i
have
thought
upon
her
that
she
will
always
be
there
gliding
silently
through
the
deserted
streets
of
that
wee
toon
on
through
all
the
ages
that
are
to
come
and
always
a
cowled
veiled
figure
of
reproach
and
hatred
for
the
german
race
there
is
some
life
in
that
wee
place
now
there
are
no
more
germans
and
no
more
shells
come
there
the
battle
line
has
been
carried
on
to
the
east
by
the
british
here
they
have
redeemed
a
bit
of
france
from
the
german
yoke
and
so
we
could
stop
there
in
the
heat
of
the
morning
for
a
bit
of
refreshment
at
a
cafe
that
was
once
i
suppose
quite
a
place
in
that
sma
toon
it
does
but
little
business
now
passing
soldiers
bring
it
some
trade
but
nothing
like
what
it
used
to
have
for
this
is
not
a
town
much
frequented
by
troops
or
was
not
just
at
that
time
there
was
some
trouble
too
with
one
of
the
cars
so
we
went
for
a
short
walk
through
the
town
it
was
then
that
we
met
that
old
french
nun
her
face
and
her
hands
were
withered
and
deeply
graven
with
the
lines
of
the
years
that
had
bowed
her
head
her
back
was
bent
and
she
walked
slowly
and
with
difficulty
but
in
her
eyes
was
a
soft
young
light
that
i
have
often
seen
in
the
eyes
of
priests
and
nuns
and
that
their
comforting
religion
gives
them
but
as
we
talked
i
spoke
of
the
germans
gone
from
her
eyes
was
all
their
softness
they
flashed
a
bitter
and
contemptuous
hatred
the
germans
she
said
she
spat
upon
the
ground
scornfully
and
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
loathing
and
every
time
she
uttered
that
hated
word
she
spat
again
it
was
a
ceremony
she
used
she
felt
i
know
that
her
mouth
was
defiled
by
that
word
and
she
wished
to
cleanse
it
it
was
no
affectation
as
with
some
folk
you
might
have
thought
it
it
was
not
a
studied
act
she
did
it
i
do
believe
unconsciously
and
it
was
a
gesture
marvelously
expressive
it
spoke
more
eloquently
of
her
feelings
than
many
words
could
have
done
she
had
seen
the
germans
aye
she
had
seen
them
come
in
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
rolling
past
in
great
gray
waves
for
days
and
days
as
if
the
flood
would
never
cease
to
roll
she
had
seen
them
passing
with
their
guns
in
those
first
proud
days
of
the
war
when
they
had
reckoned
themselves
invincible
and
been
so
sure
of
victory
she
knew
what
cruelties
what
indignities
they
had
put
upon
the
helpless
people
the
war
had
swept
into
their
clutch
she
knew
the
defilements
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
nor
was
that
the
first
time
she
had
seen
germans
they
had
come
before
she
was
so
old
though
even
then
she
had
not
been
a
young
girl
in
the
war
of
when
europe
left
brave
france
to
her
fate
because
the
german
spirit
and
the
german
plan
were
not
appreciated
or
understood
thank
god
the
world
had
learned
its
lesson
by
when
the
hun
challenged
it
again
so
that
the
challenge
was
met
and
taken
up
and
france
was
not
left
alone
to
bear
the
brunt
of
german
greed
and
german
hate
she
hated
the
germans
that
old
french
nun
she
was
religious
she
knew
the
teachings
of
her
church
she
knew
that
god
says
we
must
love
our
enemies
but
he
could
not
expect
us
to
love
his
enemies
albert
when
we
came
to
it
we
found
a
ruin
indeed
the
german
guns
had
beaten
upon
it
until
it
was
like
a
rubbish
heap
in
the
backyard
of
hell
their
malice
had
wrought
a
ruin
here
almost
worse
than
that
at
arras
only
one
building
had
survived
although
it
was
crumbling
to
ruin
that
was
a
church
and
as
we
approached
it
we
could
see
from
the
great
way
off
a
great
gilded
figure
of
the
holy
virgin
holding
in
her
arms
the
infant
christ
the
figure
leaned
at
such
an
angle
high
up
against
the
tottering
wall
of
the
church
that
it
seemed
that
it
must
fall
at
the
next
moment
even
as
we
stared
at
it
but
it
does
not
fall
every
breath
of
wind
that
comes
sets
it
to
swaying
gently
when
the
wind
rises
to
a
storm
it
must
rock
perilously
indeed
but
still
it
stays
there
hanging
like
an
inspiration
straight
from
heaven
to
all
who
see
it
the
peasants
who
gaze
upon
it
each
day
in
reverent
awe
whisper
to
you
if
you
ask
them
that
when
it
falls
at
last
the
war
will
be
over
and
france
will
be
victorious
that
is
rank
superstition
you
say
aye
it
may
be
but
in
the
region
of
the
front
everyone
you
meet
has
become
superstitious
if
that
is
the
word
you
choose
that
is
especially
true
of
the
soldiers
every
man
at
the
front
it
seemed
to
me
was
a
fatalist
what
is
to
be
will
be
they
say
it
is
certain
that
this
feeling
has
helped
to
make
them
indifferent
to
danger
almost
indeed
contemptuous
of
it
and
in
france
i
was
told
almost
everywhere
there
were
shrines
in
which
figures
of
christ
or
of
his
mother
had
survived
the
most
furious
shelling
all
the
world
knows
too
how
at
rheims
where
the
great
cathedral
has
been
shattered
in
the
wickedest
and
most
wanton
of
all
the
crimes
of
that
sort
that
the
germans
have
to
their
account
the
statue
of
jeanne
who
saved
france
long
ago
stands
untouched
how
is
a
man
to
account
for
such
things
as
that
is
he
to
put
them
down
to
chance
to
luck
to
a
blind
fate
i
for
one
can
not
do
so
nor
will
i
try
to
learn
to
do
it
fate
to
be
sure
is
a
strange
thing
as
my
friends
the
soldiers
know
so
well
but
there
is
a
difference
between
fate
or
chance
and
the
sort
of
force
that
preserves
statues
like
those
i
have
named
a
man
never
knows
his
luck
he
does
well
not
to
brood
upon
it
i
remember
the
case
of
a
chap
i
knew
who
was
out
for
nearly
three
years
taking
part
in
great
battles
from
mons
to
arras
he
was
scratched
once
or
twice
but
was
never
even
really
wounded
badly
enough
to
go
to
hospital
he
went
to
london
at
last
on
leave
and
within
an
hour
of
the
time
when
he
stepped
from
his
train
at
charing
cross
he
was
struck
by
a
and
killed
and
there
was
the
strange
ease
of
my
friend
tamson
the
baker
of
which
i
told
you
earlier
no
a
man
never
knows
his
fate
so
it
seemed
to
me
as
we
drove
toward
arras
and
watched
that
mysterious
figure
that
god
himself
had
chosen
to
leave
it
there
as
a
sign
and
a
warning
and
a
promise
all
at
once
there
was
no
sign
of
life
at
first
when
we
came
into
the
town
silence
brooded
over
the
ruins
we
stopped
to
have
a
look
around
in
that
scene
of
desolation
and
as
the
motors
throbbed
beneath
the
hoods
it
seemed
to
me
the
noise
they
made
was
close
to
being
blasphemous
we
were
right
under
that
hanging
figure
of
the
virgin
and
of
christ
and
to
have
left
the
silence
unbroken
would
have
been
more
seemly
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
silence
of
the
town
was
broken
by
another
sound
it
was
marching
men
we
heard
but
they
were
scuffling
with
their
feet
as
they
came
they
had
not
the
rhythmic
tread
of
most
of
the
british
troops
we
had
encountered
nor
were
these
men
when
they
swung
into
sight
coming
around
a
pile
of
ruins
just
like
any
british
troops
we
had
seen
i
recognized
them
as
once
as
australians
kangaroos
as
their
mates
in
other
divisions
called
them
by
the
way
their
campaign
hats
were
looped
up
at
one
side
these
were
the
first
australian
troops
i
had
seen
since
i
had
sailed
from
sydney
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
nearly
three
years
before
three
years
to
think
of
it
and
of
what
those
years
had
seen
here
a
rare
chance
to
give
a
concert
i
said
and
held
up
my
hand
to
the
officer
in
command
halt
he
cried
and
then
stand
at
ease
i
was
about
to
tell
him
why
i
had
stopped
them
and
make
myself
known
to
them
when
i
saw
a
grin
rippling
its
way
over
all
those
bronzed
faces
a
grin
of
recognition
and
i
saw
that
the
officer
knew
me
too
even
before
a
loud
voice
cried
out
good
old
harry
lauder
that
was
a
good
scots
voice
even
though
its
owner
wore
the
australian
uniform
would
the
boys
like
to
hear
a
concert
i
asked
the
officer
that
they
would
by
all
means
he
said
glad
of
the
chance
and
so
i
i
heard
you
just
once
before
in
sydney
away
back
in
the
summer
of
then
the
big
fellow
who
had
called
my
name
spoke
up
again
sing
us
he
begged
sing
us
harry
i
heard
you
sing
it
years
agone
in
motherwell
toon
hall
calligan
the
request
for
that
song
took
me
back
indeed
through
all
the
years
that
i
have
been
before
the
public
it
must
have
been
at
least
years
since
he
had
heard
me
sing
that
song
all
of
years
calligan
had
been
one
of
the
very
earliest
of
my
successes
on
the
stage
i
had
not
thought
of
the
song
much
less
sung
it
for
years
and
years
in
fact
though
i
racked
my
brains
i
could
not
remember
the
words
and
so
much
as
i
should
have
liked
to
do
so
i
could
not
sing
it
for
him
but
if
he
was
disappointed
he
took
it
in
good
part
and
he
seemed
to
like
some
of
the
newer
songs
i
had
to
sing
for
them
as
well
as
he
could
ever
have
liked
old
calligan
i
sang
for
these
kangaroos
a
song
i
had
not
sung
before
in
france
because
it
seemed
to
be
an
especially
auspicious
time
to
try
it
i
wrote
it
while
i
was
in
australia
with
a
view
particularly
to
pleasing
australian
audiences
and
so
repaying
them
in
some
measure
for
the
kindly
way
in
which
they
treated
me
while
i
was
there
i
call
it
australia
is
the
land
for
me
and
this
is
the
way
it
goes
there
a
land
i
like
to
tell
you
all
about
it
a
land
in
the
far
south
sea
it
a
land
where
the
sun
shines
nearly
every
day
it
the
land
for
you
and
me
it
the
land
for
the
man
with
the
big
strong
arm
it
the
land
for
big
hearts
too
it
a
land
we
fight
for
everything
that
right
for
australia
is
the
real
true
blue
refrain
it
the
land
where
the
sun
shines
nearly
every
day
where
the
skies
are
ever
blue
where
the
folks
are
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
and
there
lots
of
work
to
do
where
the
soft
winds
blow
and
the
gum
trees
grow
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
where
the
magpie
chaffs
and
the
laughs
australia
is
the
land
for
me
those
kangaroos
took
to
that
song
as
a
duck
takes
to
water
they
raised
the
chorus
with
me
in
a
swelling
roar
as
soon
as
they
had
heard
it
once
to
learn
it
and
their
voices
roared
through
the
ruins
like
vocal
shrapnel
you
could
hear
them
whoop
australia
is
the
land
for
me
a
mile
away
and
if
anything
could
have
brought
down
that
tottering
statue
above
us
it
would
have
been
the
way
they
sang
they
put
body
and
soul
as
well
as
voice
into
that
final
patriotic
declaration
of
the
song
we
had
thought
i
speak
for
hogge
and
adam
and
myself
and
not
for
godfrey
who
did
not
have
to
think
and
guess
but
know
we
had
thought
when
we
rolled
into
albert
that
it
was
a
city
of
the
dead
utterly
deserted
and
forlorn
but
now
as
i
went
on
singing
we
found
that
that
idea
had
been
all
wrong
for
as
the
australians
whooped
up
their
choruses
other
soldiers
popped
into
sight
they
came
pouring
from
all
directions
i
have
seen
few
sights
more
amazing
they
came
from
cracks
and
crevices
as
it
seemed
from
under
tumbled
heaps
of
ruins
and
dropping
down
from
shells
of
houses
where
there
were
certainly
no
stairs
as
i
live
before
i
had
finished
my
audience
had
been
swollen
to
a
great
one
of
two
thousand
men
when
they
were
all
roaring
out
in
a
chorus
you
could
scarce
hear
johnson
wee
piano
at
all
it
sounded
only
like
a
feeble
tinkle
when
there
was
a
part
for
it
alone
i
began
shaking
hands
when
i
had
finished
singing
that
was
a
verrainjudeecious
thing
for
me
to
attempt
there
i
had
not
reckoned
with
the
strength
of
the
grip
of
those
laddies
from
the
underside
of
the
world
but
i
had
been
there
and
i
should
have
known
soon
came
the
order
to
the
kangaroos
fall
in
at
once
the
habit
of
stern
discipline
prevailed
they
swung
off
again
and
the
last
we
saw
of
them
they
were
just
brown
men
disappearing
along
a
brown
road
bound
for
the
trenches
swiftly
the
dwellers
in
albert
melted
away
until
only
a
few
officers
were
left
beside
the
members
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
and
i
grew
grave
and
distraught
myself
chapter
xxv
one
of
the
officers
at
albert
was
looking
at
me
in
a
curiously
intent
fashion
i
noticed
that
and
soon
he
came
over
to
me
where
do
you
go
next
harry
he
asked
me
his
voice
was
keenly
sympathetic
and
his
eyes
and
his
manner
were
very
grave
to
a
place
called
ovilliers
i
said
so
i
thought
he
said
he
put
out
his
hand
and
i
gripped
it
hard
i
know
harry
i
know
exactly
where
you
are
going
and
i
will
send
a
man
with
you
to
act
as
your
guide
who
knows
the
spot
you
want
to
reach
i
could
answer
him
i
was
too
deeply
moved
for
ovilliers
is
the
spot
where
my
son
captain
john
lauder
lies
in
his
soldier
grave
that
grave
had
been
of
course
from
the
very
first
the
final
the
ultimate
objective
of
my
journey
and
that
morning
as
we
set
out
from
tramecourt
captain
godfrey
had
told
me
with
grave
sympathy
that
at
last
we
were
coming
to
the
spot
that
had
been
so
constantly
in
my
thoughts
ever
since
we
had
sailed
from
folkestone
and
so
a
private
soldier
joined
our
party
as
guide
and
we
took
to
the
road
again
the
bapaume
road
it
was
a
famous
highway
bitterly
contested
savagely
fought
for
it
was
one
of
the
strategic
roads
of
that
whole
region
and
the
hun
had
made
a
desperate
fight
to
keep
control
of
it
but
he
had
failed
as
he
has
failed
and
is
failing
still
in
all
his
major
efforts
in
france
there
was
no
talking
in
our
car
which
this
morning
was
the
second
in
the
line
i
certainly
was
not
disposed
to
chat
and
i
suppose
that
sympathy
for
my
feelings
and
my
glumness
stilled
the
tongues
of
my
companions
and
at
any
rate
we
had
not
traveled
far
when
the
car
ahead
of
us
stopped
and
the
soldier
from
albert
stepped
into
the
road
and
waited
for
me
i
got
out
when
our
car
stopped
and
joined
him
i
will
show
you
the
place
now
lauder
he
said
quietly
so
we
left
the
cars
standing
in
the
road
and
set
out
across
a
field
that
like
all
the
fields
in
that
vicinity
had
been
ripped
and
torn
by
all
about
us
as
we
crossed
that
tragic
field
there
were
little
brown
mounds
each
with
a
white
wooden
cross
upon
it
june
was
out
that
day
in
full
bloom
all
over
the
valley
thickly
sown
with
those
white
crosses
wild
flowers
in
rare
profusion
and
thickly
matted
luxuriant
grasses
and
all
the
little
shrubs
that
god
himself
looks
after
were
growing
bravely
in
the
sunlight
as
though
they
were
trying
to
hide
the
work
of
the
hun
it
was
a
mournful
journey
but
in
some
strange
way
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
day
brought
comfort
to
me
and
my
own
grief
was
altered
by
the
vision
of
the
grief
that
had
come
to
so
many
others
those
crosses
stretching
away
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
attested
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
i
alone
who
had
suffered
and
lost
and
laid
a
sacrifice
upon
the
altar
of
my
country
and
in
the
presence
of
so
many
evidences
of
grief
and
desolation
a
private
grief
sank
into
its
true
proportions
it
was
no
less
keen
the
agony
of
the
thought
of
my
boy
was
as
sharp
as
ever
but
i
knew
that
he
was
only
one
and
that
i
was
only
one
father
and
there
were
so
many
like
him
and
so
many
like
me
god
help
us
all
well
he
did
help
me
as
i
have
told
and
i
hope
and
pray
that
he
has
helped
many
another
i
believe
he
has
indeed
i
know
it
hogge
and
adam
my
two
good
friends
walked
with
me
on
that
sad
pilgrimage
i
was
acutely
conscious
of
their
sympathy
it
was
sweet
and
precious
to
have
it
but
i
do
not
think
we
exchanged
a
word
as
we
crossed
that
field
there
was
no
need
of
words
i
knew
without
speech
from
them
how
they
felt
and
they
knew
that
i
knew
so
we
came
when
we
were
perhaps
half
a
mile
from
the
bapaume
road
to
a
slight
eminence
a
tiny
hill
that
rose
from
the
field
a
little
military
cemetery
crowned
it
here
the
graves
were
set
in
ordered
rows
and
there
was
a
fence
set
around
them
to
keep
them
apart
and
to
mark
that
spot
as
holy
ground
until
the
end
of
time
five
hundred
british
boys
lie
sleeping
in
that
small
acre
of
silence
and
among
them
is
my
own
laddie
there
the
fondest
hopes
of
my
life
the
hopes
that
sustained
and
cheered
me
through
many
years
lie
buried
no
one
spoke
but
the
soldier
pointed
silently
and
eloquently
to
one
brown
mound
in
a
row
of
brown
mounds
that
looked
alike
each
like
the
other
then
he
drew
away
and
hogge
and
adam
stopped
and
stood
together
quiet
and
grave
and
so
i
went
alone
to
my
boy
grave
and
flung
myself
down
upon
the
warm
friendly
earth
my
memories
of
that
moment
are
not
very
clear
but
i
think
that
for
a
few
minutes
i
was
utterly
spent
that
my
collapse
was
complete
he
was
such
a
good
boy
i
hope
you
will
not
think
those
of
you
my
friends
who
may
read
what
i
am
writing
here
that
i
am
exalting
my
lad
above
all
the
other
britons
who
died
for
king
and
country
or
and
aye
above
the
brave
laddies
of
other
races
who
died
to
stop
the
hun
but
he
was
such
a
good
boy
as
i
lay
there
on
that
brown
mound
under
the
june
sun
that
day
all
that
he
had
been
and
all
that
he
had
meant
to
me
and
to
his
mother
came
rushing
back
afresh
to
my
memory
opening
anew
my
wounds
of
grief
i
thought
of
him
as
a
baby
and
as
a
wee
laddie
beginning
to
run
around
and
talk
to
us
i
thought
of
him
in
every
phase
and
bit
of
his
life
and
of
the
friends
that
we
had
been
he
and
i
such
chums
we
were
always
and
as
i
lay
there
as
i
look
back
upon
it
now
i
can
think
of
but
the
one
desire
that
ruled
and
moved
me
i
wanted
to
reach
my
arms
down
into
that
dark
grave
and
clasp
my
boy
tightly
to
my
breast
and
kiss
him
and
i
wanted
to
thank
him
for
what
he
had
done
for
his
country
and
his
mother
and
for
me
again
there
came
to
me
as
i
lay
there
the
same
gracious
solace
that
god
had
given
me
after
i
heard
of
his
glorious
death
and
i
knew
that
this
dark
grave
so
sad
and
lonely
and
forlorn
was
but
the
temporary
bivouac
of
my
boy
i
knew
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
trench
of
refuge
against
the
storm
of
battle
in
which
he
was
resting
until
that
hour
shall
sound
when
we
shall
all
be
reunited
beyond
the
shadowy
borderland
of
death
how
long
did
i
lie
there
i
do
not
know
and
how
i
found
the
strength
at
last
to
drag
myself
to
my
feet
and
away
from
that
spot
the
dearest
and
the
saddest
spot
on
earth
to
me
god
only
knows
it
was
an
hour
of
very
great
anguish
for
me
an
hour
of
an
anguish
different
but
only
less
keen
than
that
which
i
had
known
when
they
had
told
me
first
that
i
should
never
see
my
laddie
in
the
flesh
again
but
as
i
took
up
the
melancholy
journey
across
that
field
with
its
brown
mounds
and
its
white
crosses
stretching
so
far
away
they
seemed
to
bring
me
a
sort
of
tragic
consolation
i
thought
of
all
the
ones
at
home
in
britain
how
many
were
waiting
as
i
had
waited
until
they
too
they
too
might
come
to
france
and
cast
themselves
down
as
i
had
done
upon
some
brown
mound
sacred
in
their
thoughts
how
many
were
praying
for
the
day
to
come
when
they
might
gaze
upon
a
white
cross
as
i
had
done
and
from
the
brown
mound
out
of
which
it
rose
gather
a
few
crumbs
of
that
brown
earth
to
be
deposited
in
a
sacred
corner
of
a
sacred
place
yonder
in
britain
while
i
was
in
america
on
my
last
tour
a
woman
wrote
to
me
from
a
town
in
the
state
of
maine
she
was
a
stranger
to
me
when
she
sat
down
to
write
that
letter
but
i
count
her
now
although
i
have
never
seen
her
among
my
very
dearest
friends
i
have
a
friend
in
france
she
wrote
he
is
there
with
our
american
army
and
we
had
a
letter
from
him
the
other
day
i
think
you
would
like
to
hear
what
he
wrote
to
us
was
walking
in
the
gloaming
here
in
france
the
other
evening
he
wrote
know
i
have
always
been
very
fond
of
that
old
song
of
harry
lauder
in
the
gloamin
i
was
roamin
in
the
gloamin
myself
and
as
i
went
i
hummed
that
very
song
under
my
breath
and
i
came
in
my
walk
to
a
little
cemetery
on
a
tiny
hill
there
were
many
mounds
there
and
many
small
white
crosses
about
one
of
them
a
union
jack
was
wrapped
so
tightly
that
i
could
not
read
the
inscription
upon
it
and
something
led
me
to
unfurl
that
flag
so
that
i
could
read
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
the
grave
of
harry
lauder
son
captain
john
lauder
of
the
argyle
and
sutherland
highlanders
and
his
little
family
crest
was
upon
the
cross
stood
there
looking
down
at
that
grave
and
i
said
a
little
prayer
all
by
myself
and
then
i
rewound
the
union
jack
about
the
cross
i
went
over
to
some
ruins
nearby
and
there
i
found
a
red
rose
growing
i
do
believe
it
was
the
last
rose
of
summer
and
i
took
it
up
very
carefully
roots
and
all
and
carried
it
over
to
captain
lauder
grave
and
planted
it
there
what
a
world
of
comfort
those
words
brought
me
it
was
about
eight
one
morning
that
captain
lauder
was
killed
between
courcellete
and
poizieres
on
the
ancre
in
the
region
that
is
known
as
the
somme
battlefield
it
was
soon
after
breakfast
and
john
was
going
about
seeing
to
his
men
his
company
was
to
be
relieved
that
day
and
to
go
back
from
the
trenches
to
rest
billets
behind
the
lines
we
had
sent
our
laddie
a
braw
lot
of
christmas
packages
not
long
before
but
he
had
had
them
kept
at
the
rest
billet
so
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
opening
them
when
he
was
out
of
the
trenches
and
had
a
little
leisure
even
though
it
made
his
christmas
presents
a
wee
bit
late
there
had
been
a
little
mist
upon
the
ground
as
at
that
damp
and
chilly
season
of
the
year
there
nearly
always
was
along
the
river
ancre
at
that
time
on
that
morning
it
was
just
beginning
to
rise
as
the
sun
grew
strong
enough
to
banish
it
i
think
john
trusted
too
much
to
the
mist
perhaps
he
stepped
for
just
a
moment
into
the
open
for
just
a
moment
he
exposed
himself
as
he
had
to
do
no
doubt
to
do
his
duty
and
a
german
sniper
watching
for
just
such
chances
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
his
rifle
spoke
its
bullet
pierced
john
brave
and
gentle
heart
tate
john
a
man
from
our
own
town
was
the
first
to
reach
him
tate
was
never
far
from
john
side
and
he
was
when
he
reached
him
that
morning
and
found
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
him
many
of
the
soldiers
who
served
with
john
and
under
him
have
written
to
me
and
come
to
me
and
all
of
them
have
told
me
the
same
thing
that
there
was
not
a
man
in
his
company
who
did
not
feel
his
death
as
a
personal
loss
and
bereavement
and
his
superior
officers
have
told
me
the
same
thing
in
so
far
as
such
reports
could
comfort
us
his
mother
and
i
have
taken
solace
in
them
all
that
we
have
heard
of
john
life
in
the
trenches
and
of
his
death
was
such
a
report
as
we
or
any
parents
should
want
to
have
of
their
boy
john
never
lost
his
rare
good
nature
there
were
times
when
things
were
going
very
badly
indeed
but
at
such
times
he
could
always
be
counted
upon
to
raise
a
laugh
and
uplift
the
spirits
of
his
men
he
knew
them
all
he
knew
them
well
nearly
all
of
them
came
from
his
home
region
near
the
clyde
and
so
they
were
his
neighbors
and
his
friends
i
have
told
you
earlier
that
john
was
a
good
musician
he
played
the
piano
rarely
well
for
an
amateur
and
he
had
a
grand
singing
voice
and
one
of
his
told
me
that
after
the
fight
at
one
of
the
phases
of
the
great
battle
of
the
somme
john
company
found
itself
toward
evening
near
the
ruins
of
an
old
chateau
after
that
fight
by
the
way
dire
news
sad
news
came
to
our
village
of
the
men
of
the
argyle
and
sutherland
regiment
and
there
were
many
stricken
homes
that
mourned
brave
lads
who
would
never
come
home
again
john
men
were
near
to
exhaustion
that
night
they
had
done
terrible
work
that
day
and
their
losses
had
been
heavy
now
that
there
was
an
interlude
they
lay
about
tired
and
bruised
and
battered
many
had
been
killed
many
had
been
so
badly
wounded
that
they
lay
somewhere
behind
or
had
been
picked
up
already
by
the
red
cross
men
who
followed
them
across
the
field
of
the
attack
but
there
were
many
more
who
had
been
slightly
hurt
and
whose
wounds
began
to
pain
them
grievously
now
the
spirit
of
the
men
was
dashed
john
friend
and
told
me
of
the
scene
there
we
were
sir
he
said
we
were
pretty
well
done
in
i
can
tell
you
and
then
lauder
came
along
i
suppose
he
was
just
as
tired
and
worn
out
as
the
rest
of
us
god
knows
he
had
as
much
reason
to
be
and
more
but
he
was
as
cocky
as
a
little
bantam
and
he
was
smiling
he
looked
about
this
wo
do
he
said
got
to
get
these
lads
feeling
better
he
was
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
anyone
else
i
think
and
he
went
exploring
around
he
got
into
what
was
left
of
that
chateau
and
i
can
tell
you
it
was
much
the
germans
had
been
using
it
as
a
point
a
sort
of
sir
and
our
guns
had
smashed
it
up
pretty
thoroughly
i
no
doubt
the
fritzies
had
taken
a
hack
at
it
too
when
they
found
they
could
hold
it
any
longer
they
usually
did
but
by
a
sort
of
miracle
there
was
a
piano
inside
that
had
come
through
all
the
trouble
the
building
and
all
the
rest
of
the
furniture
had
been
knocked
to
bits
but
the
piano
was
all
right
although
as
i
say
i
do
know
how
that
had
happened
lauder
spied
it
and
went
clambering
over
all
the
debris
and
wreckage
to
reach
it
he
tried
the
keys
and
found
that
the
action
was
all
right
so
he
began
picking
out
a
tune
and
the
rest
of
us
began
to
sit
up
a
bit
and
pretty
soon
he
lifted
his
voice
in
a
rollicking
tune
one
of
your
songs
it
was
sir
and
in
no
time
the
men
were
all
sitting
up
to
listen
to
him
then
they
joined
in
the
chorus
and
pretty
soon
never
have
known
they
been
tired
or
worn
out
if
there
been
a
chance
they
have
gone
at
fritz
and
done
the
day
work
all
over
again
after
john
was
killed
his
brother
officers
sent
us
all
his
personal
belongings
we
have
his
with
the
mud
of
the
trenches
dried
upon
them
we
have
a
little
gold
locket
that
he
always
wore
around
his
neck
his
mother
picture
is
in
it
and
that
of
the
lassie
he
was
to
have
married
had
he
come
home
after
new
year
and
we
have
his
rings
and
his
boots
and
his
watch
and
all
the
other
small
possessions
that
were
a
part
of
his
daily
life
out
there
in
france
many
soldiers
and
officers
of
the
argyle
and
sutherlanders
pass
the
hoose
at
dunoon
on
the
clyde
none
ever
passes
the
hoose
though
without
dropping
in
for
a
bite
and
sup
if
he
has
time
to
stop
and
to
tell
us
stories
of
our
beloved
boy
no
i
would
no
have
you
think
that
i
would
exalt
my
boy
above
all
the
others
who
have
lived
and
died
in
france
in
the
way
of
duty
but
he
was
such
a
good
boy
we
have
heard
so
many
tales
like
those
i
have
told
you
to
make
us
proud
of
him
and
glad
that
he
bore
his
part
as
a
man
should
he
will
stay
there
in
that
small
grave
on
that
tiny
hill
i
shall
not
bring
his
body
back
to
rest
in
scotland
even
if
the
time
comes
when
i
might
do
so
it
is
a
soldier
grave
and
an
honorable
place
for
him
to
be
and
i
feel
it
is
there
that
he
would
wish
to
lie
with
his
men
lying
close
about
him
until
the
time
comes
for
the
great
reunion
but
i
am
going
back
to
france
to
visit
again
and
again
that
grave
where
he
lies
buried
so
long
as
i
live
myself
that
hill
will
be
the
shrine
to
which
my
many
pilgrimages
will
be
directed
the
time
will
come
again
when
i
may
take
his
mother
with
me
and
when
we
may
kneel
together
at
that
spot
and
meanwhile
the
wild
flowers
and
the
long
grasses
and
all
the
little
shrubs
will
keep
watch
and
ward
over
him
there
and
over
all
the
other
brave
soldiers
who
lie
hard
by
who
died
for
god
and
for
their
flag
chapter
xxvi
so
at
last
i
turned
back
toward
the
road
and
very
slowly
with
bowed
head
and
shoulders
that
felt
very
old
all
at
once
i
walked
back
toward
the
bapaume
highway
i
was
still
silent
and
when
we
reached
the
road
again
and
the
waiting
cars
i
turned
and
looked
back
long
and
sorrowfully
at
that
tiny
hill
and
the
grave
it
sheltered
godfrey
and
hogge
and
adam
johnson
and
the
soldiers
of
our
party
followed
my
gaze
but
we
looked
in
silence
not
one
of
us
had
a
word
to
say
there
are
moments
as
i
suppose
we
have
all
had
to
learn
that
are
beyond
words
and
speech
and
then
at
last
we
stepped
back
into
the
cars
and
resumed
our
journey
on
the
bapaume
road
we
started
slowly
and
i
looked
back
until
a
turn
in
the
road
hid
that
field
with
its
mounds
and
its
crosses
and
that
tiny
cemetery
on
the
wee
hill
so
i
said
to
my
boy
again
for
a
little
space
our
road
was
by
way
of
poizieres
and
this
part
of
our
journey
took
us
through
an
area
of
fearful
desolation
it
was
the
country
that
was
most
bitterly
fought
over
in
the
summer
long
battle
of
the
somme
in
when
the
new
armies
of
britain
had
their
baptism
of
fire
and
sounded
the
knell
of
doom
for
the
hun
it
was
then
he
learned
that
britain
had
had
time
after
all
to
train
troops
who
man
for
man
outmatched
his
best
here
war
had
passed
like
a
consuming
flame
leaving
no
living
thing
in
its
path
the
trees
were
mown
down
clean
to
the
ground
the
very
earth
was
blasted
out
of
all
semblance
to
its
normal
kindly
look
the
scene
was
like
a
picture
of
hell
from
dante
inferno
there
is
nothing
upon
this
earth
that
may
be
compared
with
it
death
and
pain
and
agony
had
ruled
this
whole
countryside
once
so
smiling
and
fair
to
see
after
we
had
driven
for
a
space
we
came
to
something
that
lay
by
the
roadside
that
was
a
fitting
occupant
of
such
a
spot
it
was
like
the
skeleton
of
some
giant
creature
of
a
prehistoric
age
incredibly
savage
even
in
its
stark
unlovely
death
it
might
have
been
the
frame
of
some
vast
metallic
tumble
bug
that
crawling
ominously
along
this
road
of
death
had
come
into
the
path
of
a
colossus
and
been
stepped
upon
and
then
kicked
aside
from
the
road
to
die
that
what
left
of
one
of
our
first
tanks
said
godfrey
we
used
them
first
in
this
battle
of
the
somme
you
remember
and
that
must
have
been
one
of
the
very
earliest
ones
they
been
improved
and
perfected
since
that
time
how
came
it
like
this
i
asked
gazing
at
it
curiously
a
direct
hit
from
a
big
german
shell
a
lucky
hit
of
course
about
the
only
thing
that
could
put
even
one
of
the
first
tanks
out
of
action
that
way
ordinary
shells
from
field
pieces
fire
that
sort
of
thing
made
no
impression
on
the
tanks
but
of
course
i
could
see
for
myself
the
of
the
monster
had
been
pretty
thoroughly
knocked
out
well
that
tank
had
done
its
bit
i
have
no
doubt
and
since
its
heyday
the
brain
of
mars
has
spawned
so
many
new
ideas
that
this
vast
creature
would
have
been
obsolete
and
ready
for
the
scrap
heap
even
had
the
hun
not
put
it
there
before
its
time
at
the
butte
de
marlincourt
one
of
the
most
bitterly
contested
bits
of
the
battlefield
we
passed
a
huge
mine
crater
and
i
made
an
inspection
of
it
it
was
like
the
crater
of
an
old
volcano
a
huge
old
mountain
with
a
hole
in
its
center
here
were
elaborate
dugouts
too
and
many
graves
soon
we
came
to
bapaume
bapaume
was
one
of
the
objectives
the
british
failed
to
reach
in
the
action
of
but
early
in
the
germans
seeing
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
tether
there
retreated
and
gave
the
town
up
but
what
a
town
they
left
bapaume
was
nearly
as
complete
a
ruin
as
arras
and
albert
but
it
had
not
been
wrecked
by
the
hun
had
done
the
work
in
cold
blood
the
houses
had
been
wrecked
by
human
hands
pictures
still
hung
crazily
upon
the
walls
grates
were
falling
out
of
beds
stood
on
end
tables
and
chairs
were
wantonly
smashed
and
there
was
black
ruin
everywhere
we
drove
on
then
to
a
small
town
where
the
skirling
of
pipes
heralded
our
coming
it
was
the
headquarters
of
general
willoughby
and
the
fortieth
division
highlanders
came
flocking
around
to
greet
us
warmly
and
they
all
begged
me
to
sing
to
them
but
the
officer
in
command
called
them
to
attention
men
he
said
harry
lauder
comes
to
us
fresh
from
the
saddest
mission
of
his
life
we
have
no
right
to
expect
him
to
sing
for
us
but
if
it
is
god
will
that
he
should
nothing
could
give
us
greater
pleasure
my
heart
was
very
heavy
within
me
and
never
even
on
the
night
when
i
went
back
to
the
shaftesbury
theater
have
i
felt
less
like
singing
but
i
saw
the
warm
sympathy
on
the
faces
of
the
boys
if
you
take
me
as
i
am
i
told
them
i
will
try
to
sing
for
you
i
will
do
my
best
anyway
when
a
man
is
killed
or
a
battalion
is
killed
or
a
regiment
is
killed
the
war
goes
on
just
the
same
and
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
fight
with
broken
ranks
i
try
to
sing
for
you
with
a
broken
heart
and
so
i
did
and
although
god
knows
it
must
have
been
a
feeble
effort
the
lads
gave
me
a
beautiful
reception
i
sang
my
older
songs
for
them
the
songs
my
own
laddie
had
loved
they
gave
us
tea
after
i
had
sung
for
them
with
chocolate
eclairs
as
a
rare
treat
we
were
surprised
to
get
such
fare
upon
the
battlefield
but
it
was
a
welcome
surprise
we
turned
back
from
bapaume
traveling
along
another
road
on
the
return
journey
and
on
the
way
we
met
about
two
hundred
german
prisoners
the
first
we
had
seen
in
any
numbers
they
were
working
on
the
road
under
guard
of
british
soldiers
they
looked
sleek
and
and
they
were
not
working
very
hard
certainly
yet
i
thought
there
was
something
about
their
expression
like
that
of
neglected
animals
i
got
out
of
the
car
and
spoke
to
an
looking
little
chap
perhaps
about
years
old
a
sergeant
he
looked
rather
suspicious
when
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
saluted
smartly
and
stood
at
attention
while
we
talked
and
he
gave
me
ready
and
civil
answers
you
speak
english
i
asked
fluently
yes
sir
how
do
you
like
being
a
prisoner
i
do
like
it
it
very
degrading
your
companions
look
pretty
happy
any
complaints
no
sir
none
what
are
the
germans
fighting
for
what
do
you
hope
to
gain
the
freedom
of
the
seas
but
you
had
that
before
the
war
broke
out
we
have
got
it
now
i
laughed
at
that
certainly
not
i
said
give
us
credit
for
doing
something
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
again
our
submarines
will
get
it
for
us
still
i
said
you
must
be
fighting
for
something
else
too
no
he
said
doggedly
just
for
the
freedom
of
the
seas
i
could
resist
telling
him
a
bit
of
news
that
the
censor
was
keeping
very
carefully
from
his
at
home
we
sank
seven
of
your
submarines
last
week
i
said
he
probably
did
believe
that
but
his
face
paled
a
bit
and
his
lips
puckered
and
he
scowled
then
as
i
turned
away
he
whipped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
a
stiff
salute
but
i
felt
that
it
was
not
the
most
gracious
salute
i
had
ever
seen
still
i
did
blame
him
much
captain
godfrey
meant
to
show
us
another
village
that
day
rather
an
interesting
spot
he
said
they
differ
these
french
villages
they
not
all
alike
by
any
means
then
before
long
he
began
to
look
puzzled
and
finally
he
called
a
halt
it
ought
to
be
right
here
he
said
it
was
not
so
long
ago
but
there
was
no
village
the
hun
had
passed
that
way
and
the
village
for
which
godfrey
was
seeking
had
been
utterly
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
not
a
trace
of
it
remained
where
men
and
women
and
little
children
had
lived
and
worked
and
played
in
quiet
happiness
the
abominable
desolation
that
is
the
work
of
the
hun
had
come
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
they
or
their
village
had
ever
been
the
hun
knows
no
mercy
chapter
xxvii
there
had
been
originally
a
perfectly
definite
route
for
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
as
definite
a
route
as
is
mapped
out
for
me
when
i
am
touring
the
united
states
our
route
had
called
for
a
fairly
steady
progress
from
vimy
ridge
to
peronne
like
bapaume
one
of
the
great
unreached
objectives
of
the
somme
offensive
and
again
like
bapaume
ruined
and
abandoned
by
the
germans
in
the
retreat
of
the
spring
of
but
we
made
many
side
trips
and
gave
many
and
many
an
unplanned
extemporaneous
roadside
concert
as
i
have
told
for
all
of
us
it
had
been
a
labor
of
love
i
will
always
believe
that
i
sang
a
little
better
on
that
tour
than
i
have
ever
sung
before
or
ever
shall
again
and
i
am
sure
too
that
hogge
and
adam
spoke
more
eloquently
to
their
soldier
hearers
than
they
ever
did
in
parliament
or
church
my
wee
piano
tinkle
tom
held
out
staunchly
he
never
wavered
in
tune
though
he
got
some
sad
jouncings
as
he
clung
to
the
grid
of
a
car
as
for
johnson
my
yorkshireman
he
was
as
good
an
accompanist
before
the
tour
ended
as
i
could
ever
want
and
he
took
the
keenest
interest
and
delight
in
his
work
from
start
to
finish
captain
godfrey
our
manager
must
have
been
proud
indeed
of
the
business
his
troupe
did
the
weather
was
splendid
the
houses
everywhere
were
so
big
that
if
there
had
been
standing
room
only
signs
they
would
have
been
called
into
use
every
day
and
his
company
got
a
wonderful
reception
wherever
it
showed
he
had
everything
a
manager
could
have
to
make
his
heart
rejoice
and
he
did
not
like
many
managers
have
to
be
continually
trying
to
patch
up
quarrels
in
the
company
he
had
no
petty
professional
jealousies
with
which
to
contend
such
things
were
unknown
in
our
troupe
all
the
time
while
i
was
singing
in
france
i
was
elaborating
an
idea
that
had
for
some
time
possessed
me
and
that
was
coming
now
to
dominate
me
utterly
i
was
thinking
of
the
maimed
soldiers
the
boys
who
had
not
died
but
had
given
a
leg
or
an
arm
or
their
sight
to
the
cause
and
who
were
doomed
to
go
through
the
rest
of
their
lives
broken
and
shattered
and
incomplete
they
were
never
out
of
my
thoughts
i
had
seen
them
before
i
ever
came
to
france
as
i
traveled
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
united
kingdom
singing
for
the
men
in
the
camps
and
the
hospitals
and
doing
what
i
could
to
help
in
the
recruiting
and
i
used
to
lie
awake
of
nights
wondering
what
would
become
of
those
poor
broken
laddies
when
the
war
was
over
and
we
were
all
setting
to
work
again
to
rebuild
our
lives
and
especially
i
thought
of
the
brave
laddies
of
my
ain
scotland
they
must
have
thought
often
of
their
future
they
must
have
wondered
what
was
to
become
of
them
when
they
had
to
take
up
the
struggle
with
the
world
anew
no
longer
on
even
terms
with
their
mates
but
handicapped
by
grievous
injuries
that
had
come
to
them
in
the
noblest
of
ways
i
remembered
crippled
soldiers
victims
of
other
wars
whom
i
had
seen
selling
papers
and
matches
on
street
corners
objects
of
charity
almost
to
a
generation
that
had
forgotten
the
service
to
the
country
that
had
put
them
in
the
way
of
having
to
make
their
living
so
and
i
had
made
a
great
resolution
that
if
i
could
do
aught
to
prevent
it
no
man
of
scotland
who
had
served
in
this
war
should
ever
have
to
seek
a
livelihood
in
such
a
manner
so
i
conceived
the
idea
of
raising
a
great
fund
to
be
used
for
giving
the
maimed
scots
soldiers
a
fresh
start
in
life
they
would
be
pensioned
by
the
government
i
knew
that
but
i
knew
too
that
a
pension
is
rarely
more
than
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
what
these
crippled
men
would
need
i
felt
was
enough
money
to
set
them
up
in
some
little
business
of
their
own
that
they
could
see
to
despite
their
wounds
or
to
enable
them
to
make
a
new
start
in
some
old
business
or
trade
if
they
could
do
so
a
man
might
need
a
hundred
pounds
i
thought
or
two
hundred
pounds
to
get
him
started
properly
again
and
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
hand
a
man
what
money
he
might
require
i
did
not
want
to
lend
it
to
him
taking
his
note
or
his
promise
to
pay
nor
did
i
want
to
give
it
to
him
as
charity
i
wanted
to
hand
it
to
him
as
a
freewill
offering
as
a
partial
payment
of
the
debt
scotland
owed
him
for
what
he
had
done
for
her
and
i
thought
too
of
men
stricken
by
or
paralyzed
in
the
war
there
are
pitifully
many
of
both
sorts
i
did
not
want
them
to
stay
in
bare
and
cold
and
lonely
institutions
i
wanted
to
take
them
out
of
such
places
and
back
to
their
homes
home
to
the
village
and
the
glen
i
wanted
to
get
them
a
with
an
old
neighborly
man
or
an
old
neighborly
woman
maybe
to
take
them
for
an
airing
in
the
forenoon
and
the
afternoon
that
they
might
breathe
the
good
scots
air
and
see
the
wild
flowers
growing
and
hear
the
song
of
the
birds
that
was
the
plan
that
had
for
a
long
time
been
taking
form
in
my
mind
i
had
talked
it
over
with
some
of
my
friends
and
the
newspapers
had
heard
of
it
somehow
and
printed
a
few
paragraphs
about
it
it
was
still
very
much
in
embryo
when
i
went
to
france
but
to
my
surprise
the
scots
soldiers
nearly
always
spoke
of
it
when
i
was
talking
with
them
they
had
seen
the
paragraphs
in
the
papers
and
i
soon
realized
that
it
loomed
up
as
a
great
thing
for
them
aye
it
a
grand
thing
you
thinking
of
harry
they
said
again
and
again
now
we
know
we
no
be
beggars
in
the
street
now
that
we
got
a
champion
like
you
harry
i
heard
such
words
as
that
first
from
a
highlander
at
arras
and
from
that
moment
i
have
thought
of
little
else
many
of
the
laddies
told
me
that
the
thought
of
being
killed
did
not
bother
them
but
that
they
did
worry
a
bit
about
their
future
in
case
they
went
home
maimed
and
helpless
we
here
to
stay
until
there
no
more
work
to
do
if
it
takes
twenty
years
harry
they
said
but
it
be
a
big
relief
to
know
we
will
be
cared
for
if
we
must
go
back
crippled
i
set
the
sum
i
would
have
to
raise
to
accomplish
the
work
i
had
in
mind
at
a
million
pounds
sterling
five
million
dollars
it
may
seem
a
great
sum
to
some
but
to
me
knowing
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
to
be
used
it
seems
small
enough
and
my
friends
agree
with
me
when
i
returned
from
france
i
talked
to
some
scots
friends
and
a
meeting
was
called
in
glasgow
of
the
andrews
society
i
addressed
it
and
it
declared
itself
in
cordial
sympathy
with
the
idea
then
i
went
to
edinburgh
and
down
to
london
and
back
north
to
manchester
everywhere
my
plan
was
greeted
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
the
real
organization
of
the
fund
was
begun
on
september
and
this
fund
of
mine
is
known
officially
as
the
harry
lauder
million
pound
fund
for
maimed
men
scottish
soldiers
and
sailors
it
does
not
in
any
way
conflict
with
nor
overlap
any
other
work
already
being
done
i
made
sure
of
that
because
i
talked
to
the
pension
minister
and
his
colleagues
in
london
before
i
went
ahead
with
my
plans
and
they
fully
and
warmly
approved
everything
that
i
planned
to
do
the
earl
of
rosebery
former
prime
minister
of
britain
is
honorary
president
of
the
fund
and
lord
balfour
of
burleigh
is
its
treasurer
and
as
i
write
we
have
raised
an
amount
well
into
six
figures
in
pounds
sterling
one
of
the
things
that
made
me
most
willing
to
undertake
my
last
tour
of
america
was
my
feeling
that
i
could
secure
the
support
and
cooperation
of
the
scottish
people
in
america
for
my
fund
better
by
personal
appeals
than
in
any
other
way
at
the
end
of
every
performance
i
gave
during
the
tour
i
told
my
audience
what
i
was
doing
and
the
object
of
the
fund
and
although
i
addressed
myself
chiefly
to
the
scots
there
has
been
a
most
generous
and
touching
response
from
americans
as
well
we
distributed
little
envelopes
in
which
folk
were
invited
to
send
contributions
to
the
bank
in
new
york
that
was
the
american
depository
and
after
each
performance
lauder
stood
in
the
lobby
and
sold
little
envelopes
full
of
stamps
sticky
backs
as
she
called
them
like
the
red
cross
seals
that
have
been
sold
so
long
in
america
at
christmas
time
she
sold
them
for
a
quarter
or
for
whatever
they
would
bring
and
all
the
money
went
to
the
fund
i
had
a
novel
experience
sometimes
often
i
would
no
sooner
have
explained
what
i
was
doing
than
i
would
feel
myself
the
target
of
a
sort
of
bombardment
at
first
i
thought
germans
were
shooting
at
me
but
i
soon
learned
that
it
was
money
that
was
being
thrown
and
every
day
my
would
be
piled
high
with
checks
and
money
orders
and
paper
money
sent
direct
to
me
instead
of
to
the
bank
but
i
had
to
ask
the
guid
folk
to
cease
firing
the
money
was
too
apt
to
be
lost
folk
of
all
races
gave
liberally
i
was
deeply
touched
at
hot
springs
arkansas
where
the
stage
hands
gave
me
the
money
they
had
received
for
their
work
during
my
engagement
chapter
xxviii
i
have
stopped
for
a
wee
digression
about
my
fund
i
saw
many
interesting
things
in
france
and
dreadful
things
and
it
was
impressed
upon
me
more
and
more
that
the
hun
knows
no
mercy
the
wicked
wanton
things
he
did
in
france
and
that
i
saw
there
was
mont
quentin
one
of
the
very
strongest
of
the
positions
out
of
which
the
british
turned
him
there
was
a
chateau
there
a
bonnie
place
and
hard
by
was
a
wee
cemetery
the
hun
had
smashed
its
pretty
monuments
and
he
had
reached
into
that
sacred
soil
with
his
filthy
claws
and
dragged
out
the
dead
from
their
and
scattered
their
helpless
bones
about
he
ruined
peronne
in
wanton
fury
because
it
was
passing
from
his
grip
he
wrecked
its
old
cathedral
once
one
of
the
loveliest
sights
in
france
he
took
away
the
old
from
the
great
gates
of
peronne
he
stole
and
carried
away
the
statues
that
used
to
stand
in
the
old
square
he
left
the
great
statue
of
peter
still
standing
in
the
churchyard
but
its
thumb
was
broken
off
i
found
it
as
i
rummaged
about
idly
in
the
debris
at
the
statue
foot
it
was
no
casual
looting
that
the
huns
did
they
did
their
work
methodically
systematically
it
was
a
sight
to
make
the
angels
weep
as
i
left
the
ruined
cathedral
i
met
a
couple
of
french
poilus
and
tried
to
talk
with
them
but
they
spoke
very
leetle
english
and
i
fired
all
my
french
words
at
them
in
one
sentence
oui
oui
madame
i
said
encore
pomme
du
terre
fini
they
laughed
but
we
did
no
get
far
with
our
talk
not
in
french
you
ca
love
the
hun
much
after
this
i
said
ze
hun
ze
bloody
boche
cried
one
of
them
i
keel
heem
all
my
life
i
was
glad
to
quit
peronne
the
rape
of
that
lovely
church
saddened
me
more
than
almost
any
sight
i
saw
in
france
i
did
not
care
to
look
at
it
so
i
was
glad
when
we
motored
on
to
the
headquarters
of
the
fourth
army
where
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
one
of
greatest
soldiers
general
sir
henry
rawlinson
who
greeted
us
most
cordially
and
invited
us
to
dinner
after
dinner
we
drove
on
toward
amiens
we
were
swinging
back
now
toward
boulogne
and
were
scheduled
to
sleep
that
night
at
amiens
which
the
germans
held
for
a
few
days
during
their
first
rush
toward
paris
before
the
marne
but
did
not
have
time
to
destroy
adam
knew
amiens
and
was
made
welcome
with
the
rest
of
us
at
an
excellent
hotel
von
kluck
had
made
its
headquarters
when
he
swung
that
way
from
brussels
and
it
was
there
he
planned
the
dinner
he
meant
to
eat
in
paris
with
the
kaiser
von
kluck
demanded
an
indemnity
of
a
million
dollars
from
amiens
to
spare
its
famous
old
cathedral
it
was
late
when
we
arrived
but
before
i
slept
i
called
for
the
boots
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
i
tried
to
get
him
to
tell
me
about
old
von
kluck
and
his
stay
but
he
could
talk
english
and
was
busy
anyway
trying
to
open
the
bottle
without
cutting
the
wire
adam
and
hogge
are
fond
to
this
day
of
telling
how
i
shouted
at
him
finally
well
how
do
you
expect
to
open
that
bottle
when
you
ca
even
talk
the
english
language
next
day
was
sunday
and
we
went
to
church
in
the
cathedral
which
von
kluck
did
destroy
after
all
there
were
signs
of
war
the
windows
and
the
fine
carved
doors
were
banked
with
sand
bags
as
a
measure
of
protection
from
bombing
airplanes
i
gave
my
last
roadside
concert
on
the
road
from
amiens
to
boulogne
it
was
at
a
little
place
called
ouef
and
we
had
some
trouble
in
finding
it
and
more
in
pronouncing
its
name
some
of
us
called
it
off
some
owf
i
knew
i
had
heard
the
name
somewhere
and
i
was
racking
my
brains
to
think
as
johnson
set
up
our
wee
piano
and
i
began
to
sing
just
as
i
finished
my
first
song
a
rooster
set
up
a
violent
crowing
in
competition
with
me
and
i
remembered
i
know
where
i
am
i
cried
i
at
egg
and
that
is
what
oeuf
means
in
english
the
soldiers
were
vastly
amused
they
were
gordon
highlanders
and
i
found
a
lot
of
chaps
among
them
frae
far
awa
aberdeen
not
many
of
them
are
alive
but
that
day
they
were
a
gay
lot
and
a
bonnie
lot
there
was
a
big
highlander
who
said
to
me
very
gravely
harry
the
only
good
thing
i
ever
saw
in
a
german
was
a
british
bayonet
if
you
ever
hear
anyone
at
hame
talking
peace
cut
off
their
heads
or
send
them
out
to
us
and
we
show
them
there
a
job
to
do
here
and
we
do
it
look
he
said
sweeping
his
arm
as
if
to
include
all
france
look
at
yon
ruins
how
would
you
like
old
england
or
auld
scotland
to
be
looking
like
that
we
not
only
going
to
break
and
scatter
the
hun
rule
harry
if
we
do
no
more
than
that
it
will
surely
be
reassembled
again
we
going
to
destroy
it
on
the
way
from
oeuf
to
boulogne
we
visited
a
small
out
of
the
way
hospital
and
i
sang
for
the
lads
there
and
i
was
going
around
afterward
talking
to
the
boys
on
their
cots
and
came
to
a
young
chap
whose
head
and
face
were
swathed
in
bandages
how
came
you
to
be
hurt
lad
i
asked
well
sir
he
said
we
were
attacking
one
morning
i
went
over
the
parapet
with
the
rest
and
got
to
the
german
trench
all
right
i
was
hurt
and
i
went
down
thirty
feet
deep
into
one
of
their
dugouts
you
would
think
men
could
live
so
but
of
course
they
not
men
they
animals
there
was
a
lighted
candle
on
a
shelf
and
beside
it
a
fountain
pen
it
was
just
an
pen
and
it
was
fair
loot
i
thought
some
chap
had
meant
to
write
a
letter
and
forgotten
his
pen
when
our
attack
came
so
i
slipped
it
in
my
pocket
two
days
later
i
was
going
to
write
a
few
lines
to
my
mother
and
tell
her
i
was
all
right
so
i
thought
i
try
my
new
pen
and
when
i
unscrewed
the
cap
it
exploded
and
well
you
see
me
harry
it
blew
half
of
my
face
away
the
hun
knows
no
mercy
i
was
glad
to
see
boulogne
again
the
white
buildings
on
the
white
hills
and
the
harbor
beyond
here
the
itinerary
of
the
reverend
harry
lauder
tour
came
to
its
formal
end
but
since
there
were
many
new
arrivals
in
the
hospitals
the
population
of
a
base
shifts
quickly
we
were
asked
to
give
a
couple
more
concerts
in
the
hospitals
where
we
had
first
appeared
on
french
soil
a
good
many
thousand
canadians
had
just
come
in
so
i
sang
at
base
hospital
no
and
then
gave
another
and
farewell
concert
at
the
great
convalescent
camp
on
the
hill
and
then
we
said
to
captain
godfrey
and
the
chauffeurs
and
to
johnson
my
accompanist
ready
to
go
back
to
his
regiment
now
i
told
them
all
i
hoped
that
when
i
came
to
france
again
to
sing
we
could
reassemble
all
the
original
cast
and
i
pray
that
we
may
on
monday
we
took
boat
again
for
folkestone
the
boat
was
crowded
with
men
going
home
on
leave
and
i
wandered
among
them
i
heard
many
a
tale
of
heroism
and
courage
of
splendid
sacrifice
and
suffering
nobly
borne
destroyers
as
before
circled
about
us
and
there
was
no
hint
of
trouble
from
a
hun
submarine
on
our
boat
was
lord
dalmeny
a
king
messenger
carrying
dispatches
from
the
front
he
asked
me
how
i
had
liked
the
show
it
is
so
that
nearly
all
british
soldiers
refer
to
the
war
they
had
earned
their
rest
those
laddies
who
were
going
home
to
britain
but
some
of
them
were
half
sorry
to
be
going
i
talked
to
one
of
them
i
do
know
harry
he
said
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
leave
for
a
long
time
i
been
oot
twa
years
my
heart
jumped
with
joy
at
first
at
the
thought
of
seeing
my
mother
and
the
auld
hame
but
now
that
i
started
and
in
a
fair
way
to
get
there
i
no
so
happy
you
see
every
young
fellow
frae
my
toon
is
awa
i
the
only
one
going
back
many
are
dead
it
wo
be
the
same
i
a
mind
just
to
stay
on
london
till
my
leave
is
up
and
then
go
back
if
i
went
home
my
mother
would
but
burst
out
greetin
an
i
think
i
could
no
stand
that
but
as
for
me
i
was
glad
though
i
was
sorry
too
to
be
going
home
i
wanted
to
go
back
again
but
i
wanted
to
hurry
to
my
wife
and
tell
her
what
i
had
seen
at
our
boy
grave
and
so
i
did
so
soon
as
i
landed
on
british
ground
once
more
i
felt
that
i
was
bearing
a
message
to
her
a
message
from
our
boy
i
felt
and
i
still
feel
that
i
could
tell
her
that
all
was
well
with
him
and
with
all
the
other
soldiers
of
britain
who
sleep
like
him
in
the
land
of
the
bleeding
lily
they
died
for
humanity
and
god
will
not
forget
and
i
think
there
is
something
for
me
to
say
to
all
those
who
are
to
know
a
grief
such
as
i
knew
every
mother
and
father
who
loves
a
son
in
this
war
must
have
a
strong
unbreakable
faith
in
the
future
life
in
the
world
beyond
where
you
will
see
your
son
again
do
not
give
way
to
grief
instead
keep
your
gaze
and
your
faith
firmly
fixed
on
the
world
beyond
and
regard
your
boy
absence
as
though
he
were
but
on
a
journey
by
keeping
your
faith
you
will
help
to
win
this
war
for
if
you
lose
it
the
war
and
your
personal
self
are
lost
my
whole
perspective
was
changed
by
my
visit
to
the
front
never
again
shall
i
know
those
moments
of
black
despair
that
used
to
come
to
me
in
my
thoughts
i
shall
never
be
far
away
from
the
little
cemetery
hard
by
the
bapaume
road
and
life
would
not
be
worth
the
living
for
me
did
i
not
believe
that
each
day
brings
me
nearer
to
seeing
him
again
i
found
a
belief
among
the
soldiers
in
france
that
was
almost
universal
i
found
it
among
all
classes
of
men
at
the
front
among
men
who
had
before
the
war
been
regularly
religious
along
lines
and
among
men
who
had
lived
just
according
to
their
own
lights
before
the
war
before
the
hun
went
mad
the
young
men
of
britain
thought
little
of
death
or
what
might
come
after
death
they
were
gay
and
careless
living
for
then
war
came
and
with
it
death
astride
of
every
minute
every
hour
and
the
young
men
began
to
think
of
spiritual
things
and
of
god
their
faces
their
deportments
may
not
have
shown
the
change
but
it
was
in
their
hearts
they
would
not
show
it
not
they
but
i
have
talked
with
hundreds
of
men
along
the
front
and
it
is
my
conviction
that
they
believe
one
and
all
that
if
they
fall
in
battle
they
only
pass
on
to
another
and
what
a
comforting
belief
that
is
it
is
that
belief
that
makes
us
indifferent
to
danger
and
to
death
a
soldier
said
to
me
we
fight
in
a
righteous
cause
and
a
holy
war
god
is
not
going
to
let
everything
end
for
us
just
because
the
mortal
life
quits
the
shell
we
call
the
body
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
i
am
sure
of
it
indeed
