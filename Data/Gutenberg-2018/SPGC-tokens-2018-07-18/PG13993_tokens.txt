your

out

letters
of
a
rookie
mable
i

dead
youll
never
know
how
near
you
was
to
right
we
got
the
tents
up
at
last
though
so
i
got
a
minit
to
rite
i
guess
they
choose
these
camps
by
mail
order
the
only
place
there
flat
is
on
the
map
where
our
tents
is
would
make
a
good
place
for
a
rocky
mountin
goat
if
he
didnt
break
his
neck
the
first
day
the
captin
came
out
an
says
pitch
your
tents
here
then
he
went
to
look
for
someone
quick
before
anyone
could
ask
him
how
i
wish
i
was
a
captin
i
guess
he
thought
we
was
alpine
chasers
eh
mable
but
you
probably
dont
know
what
those
are
honest
mable
if
id
put
in
the
work
i
done
last
week
on
the
panamah
canal
it
would
have
been
workin
long
before
it
was
of
course
there
was
a
lot
of
fellos
there
with
me
but
it
seemed
like
all
they
did
was
to
stand
round
and
hand
me
shovels
when
i
wore
em
out
the
captin
appresheates
me
though
the
other
day
he
watched
me
work
awhile
and
then
he
says
smith
he
calls
me
smith
now
we
got
very
friendly
since
i
been
nice
to
him
i
noticed
none
of
the
other
fellos
had
much
to
say
to
him
i
felt
kind
of
sorry
for
him
hes
a
human
bein
even
if
he
is
a
captin
mable
so
every
time
i
saw
him
i
used
to
stop
him
and
talk
to
him
democratic
thats
me
all
over
mable
smith
he
says
if
they
was
all
like
you
round
here
war
would
be
hell
no
joke
by
which
he
meant
that
we
would
make
it
hot
for
the
boshes
i
been
feelin
awful
sorry
for
you
mable
what
with
missin
me
and
your
fathers
liver
gone
back
on
him
again
things
must
have
been
awful
lonesome
for
you
it
isnt
as
if
you
was
a
girl
what
had
a
lot
of
fellos
hangin
round
all
the
time
not
that
you
couldnt
have
em
mable
but
you
dont
an
theres
no
use
makin
no
bones
about
it
if
it
hadnt
been
for
me
i
guess
things
would
have
been
pretty
stupid
though
i
dont
begrudge
you
a
cent
you
know
how
i
am
with
my
money
i
guess
you
ought
to
anyway
eh
mable
never
talk
of
money
matters
in
connexun
with
a
woman
thats
me
all
over
illustration
the
only
place
there
flat
is
on
the
map
illustration
you
can
read
em
to
your
granchildren
now
i
got
started
an
found
a
fountin
pen
an
the
givin
away
paper
like
it
does
im
goin
to
rite
you
regular
they
say
there
goin
to
charge
three
sents
for
a
letter
pretty
soon
that
aint
goin
to
stop
me
though
mable
there
aint
no
power
in
heavin
or
earth
as
the
poets
say
as
can
come
between
you
and
me
mable
you
mite
send
a
few
three
sent
stamps
when
you
rite
that
is
if
your
fathers
able
to
work
yet
and
willin
i
should
add
of
course
it
aint
nothin
to
me
but
id
keep
these
letters
what
you
get
from
me
as
a
record
of
the
war
some
day
you
can
read
em
to
your
granchildren
an
say
your
granfather
bill
did
all
these
things
aint
i
the
worst
mable
serious
though
i
havnt
found
noone
so
far
what
has
thought
of
doin
this
except
the
newspapers
i
guess
ill
get
a
lot
of
inside
stuff
that
theyll
never
see
so
this
may
be
the
only
one
of
its
kind
but
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
what
you
do
with
them
mable
later
ill
tell
you
all
about
everything
but
i
guess
you
wont
understand
much
cause
its
tecknickle
lots
of
the
fellos
are
gettin
nitted
things
and
candy
and
stuff
right
along
dont
pay
no
attenshun
to
that
though
or
take
it
for
a
hint
cause
it
aint
i
just
say
it
as
a
matter
of
rekord
independent
if
nothin
thats
me
all
over
yours
till
the
war
ends
mable
having
nothin
better
to
do
i
take
up
my
pen
to
rite
we
have
been
here
now
three
weeks
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
all
ready
to
go
i
told
the
captin
that
i
was
ready
any
time
he
said
yes
but
that
wed
have
to
wait
for
the
slow
ones
cause
they
was
all
goin
together
i
says
was
i
to
go
out
to
drill
with
the
rest
he
said
yes
more
for
the
example
than
anything
else
its
kind
of
maddening
to
be
hangin
round
here
when
i
might
be
over
there
helpin
the
sammies
put
a
stop
to
this
thing
illustration
you
walk
a
post
but
there
aint
no
post
in
the
mean
time
i
been
doin
guard
duty
seems
like
i
been
doin
it
every
night
but
i
know
what
there
up
against
and
i
dont
say
nothin
guard
duty
is
something
like
extemperaneus
speakin
you
got
to
know
everything
your
goin
to
say
before
you
start
its
very
tecknickle
for
instance
you
walk
a
post
but
there
aint
no
post
an
you
mount
guard
but
you
dont
really
mount
nothin
an
you
turn
out
the
guard
but
you
dont
really
turn
em
out
they
come
out
them
selves
just
the
other
night
i
was
walkin
along
thinkin
of
you
mable
an
my
feet
which
was
hurtin
it
made
me
awful
lonesome
an
officer
come
up
and
he
says
why
dont
you
draw
your
pistol
when
you
here
someone
comin
an
i
says
i
dont
wait
till
the
sheep
is
stole
i
drew
it
this
afternoon
from
the
supply
sargent
an
i
showed
it
to
him
tucked
inside
my
shirt
where
noone
could
get
it
away
from
me
without
some
tussel
you
bet
mable
but
it
seems
that
you
got
to
keep
on
drawin
it
all
the
time
then
later
i
here
footsteps
i
was
expectin
the
relief
so
i
was
right
on
the
job
an
a
man
come
up
and
i
poked
my
pistol
right
in
his
face
an
says
halt
who
goes
there
and
he
says
officer
of
the
day
an
bein
disappointed
as
who
wouldnt
be
i
says
oh
hell
i
thought
it
was
the
relief
an
he
objected
to
that
the
relief
mable
but
whats
the
use
you
wouldnt
understand
it
theres
some
mistake
up
north
mable
about
the
way
were
built
mable
its
kind
of
depresin
to
think
that
you
could
forget
about
us
so
quick
everyones
gettin
sweters
without
sleeves
and
gloves
without
fingers
we
still
got
everything
we
started
with
mable
why
not
sox
without
feet
and
pants
without
legs
if
your
makin
these
things
for
after
the
war
i
think
your
anticipatin
a
little
besides
its
depresin
for
the
fellos
to
be
reminded
all
the
time
its
like
givin
a
fello
a
life
membership
to
the
old
soldiers
home
to
cheer
him
up
when
he
sails
i
was
sayin
the
other
day
that
if
the
fellos
at
washington
ever
get
onto
this
theyll
be
issuin
soleles
shoes
and
shirtles
sleves
its
gettin
awful
cold
no
wonder
this
is
a
healthy
place
all
the
germs
is
froze
i
guess
there
idea
of
the
hardenin
proces
is
to
freeze
a
fello
stiff
the
captin
said
the
other
day
we
was
gettin
in
tents
of
trainin
thats
all
right
but
id
kind
of
like
to
see
those
steam
heated
barraks
youve
red
about
those
fellos
that
go
swimmin
in
the
ice
in
winter
i
guess
thed
like
our
shouer
baths
they
say
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
mable
i
say
its
next
to
impossible
i
started
this
letter
almost
a
weak
ago
i
just
found
it
in
my
bakin
can
they
call
it
a
bakin
can
but
its
too
small
to
bake
nothin
i
keep
my
soap
in
it
i
got
some
news
for
you
the
regiment
is
to
be
dismantled
the
captin
called
me
over
this
mornin
and
asked
me
where
id
like
to
be
transferred
i
said
home
if
it
was
the
same
to
him
so
there
goin
to
send
me
to
the
artillery
this
is
a
very
dangerous
and
useful
limb
of
the
servus
mable
i
dont
kno
my
address
just
write
me
care
of
the
general
i
got
the
red
muffler
that
your
mother
sent
me
give
her
my
love
just
the
same
yours
relentlessly
illustration
i
just
found
it
in
my
bakin
can
i
havnt
rote
for
some
time
i
had
such
sore
feet
lately
when
they
broke
up
our
regiment
and
sent
me
over
to
the
artillery
i
thought
i
was
goin
to
quit
usin
my
feet
that
was
just
another
roomor
thanks
for
the
box
of
stuff
you
sent
me
i
guess
the
brakeman
must
have
used
it
for
a
chair
all
the
way
it
was
pretty
well
baled
but
that
dont
matter
and
thanks
for
the
fudge
too
that
was
fudge
wasnt
it
mable
and
the
sox
they
dont
fit
but
i
can
use
them
for
somethin
a
good
soldier
never
throws
nothin
away
an
thank
your
mother
for
the
half
pair
of
gloves
she
sent
me
i
put
them
away
maybe
sometime
shell
get
a
chance
to
nit
the
other
half
or
if
i
ever
get
all
my
fingers
shot
off
theyll
come
in
very
handy
the
artillerys
a
little
different
from
the
infantry
they
make
us
work
harder
at
least
theres
more
work
on
the
skedule
i
know
now
what
they
mean
when
they
say
that
the
artillerys
active
on
the
western
front
they
got
a
drill
over
here
called
the
standin
gun
drill
the
names
misleadin
i
guess
it
was
invented
by
a
troop
of
jap
akrobats
they
make
you
get
up
and
sit
on
the
gun
before
you
can
get
settled
comfortable
they
make
you
get
down
again
it
looks
like
they
didnt
know
just
what
they
did
want
you
to
do
i
dont
like
the
sargent
i
dont
like
any
sargent
but
this
one
particular
the
first
day
out
be
kept
sayin
prepare
to
mount
and
then
mount
finally
i
went
up
to
him
and
told
him
that
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
he
could
cut
that
stuff
for
i
was
always
prepared
to
do
what
i
was
told
even
though
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
he
said
fine
then
i
was
probably
prepared
to
scrub
pans
all
day
sunday
i
dont
care
much
for
horses
i
think
they
feels
the
same
way
about
me
most
of
them
are
so
big
that
the
only
thing
there
good
for
is
the
view
of
the
camp
you
get
when
you
climb
up
they
are
what
they
call
hors
de
combat
in
french
my
horse
died
the
other
day
i
guess
it
wasnt
much
effort
for
him
if
it
had
been
he
wouldnt
have
done
it
they
got
a
book
they
call
drill
regulations
field
and
light
thats
about
as
censible
as
it
is
all
the
way
through
for
instance
they
say
that
when
the
command
for
action
is
given
one
man
jumps
for
the
wheel
and
another
springs
for
the
trail
an
another
leaps
for
the
muzzle
i
guess
the
fellow
that
rote
the
regulations
thought
we
was
a
bunch
of
grass
hoppers
illustration
i
dont
like
any
sargeant
illustration
i
dont
care
much
for
horses
they
feels
the
same
way
about
me
well
i
got
to
quit
now
an
rite
a
bunch
of
other
girls
thanks
again
for
the
box
although
it
was
so
busted
that
it
wasnt
much
good
but
that
dont
matter
yours
till
you
here
otherwise
mable
todays
thanksgivin
im
thankful
things
aint
no
worse
though
max
glucos
what
lives
on
the
next
cot
says
they
couldnt
be
cheery
an
bright
to
the
last
thats
me
all
over
mable
every
man
gets
ateen
ounces
of
turky
on
thanksgivin
all
to
himself
mable
the
sargent
says
the
commitee
on
hays
and
beans
at
washington
decides
that
mines
inside
im
most
to
full
for
expreshun
as
the
poets
say
we
had
a
great
dinner
soup
an
turky
dressin
crambury
sause
an
pie
an
smashed
potatoes
all
in
one
plate
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
how
the
fellos
enjoyed
it
mable
i
know
now
why
they
call
the
turkys
gobblers
thanksgivin
is
a
holiday
all
a
fello
has
to
do
on
a
holiday
in
the
artillery
is
to
feed
the
horses
an
give
em
a
drink
an
smooth
em
out
an
take
em
for
a
walk
an
then
feed
em
an
smooth
em
out
an
feed
em
an
give
em
a
drink
it
makes
a
fello
feel
like
givin
back
a
dollar
out
of
his
pay
at
the
end
of

smith
are
you
laffin
at
me
the
horses
has
the
softest
of
anyone
mable
they
dont
even
have
to
get
up
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
we
bring
it
to
em
in
a
little
bag
filled
with
cereul
you
tie
this
on
there
face
i
guess
they
aint
never
been
fed
before
the
war
broke
out
when
they
see
you
comin
they
start
jumpin
round
like
starvin
sailurs
i
dont
guess
they
like
cereul
i
wouldnt
ether
three
times
a
day
i
thought
theyd
give
em
somethin
different
thanksgivin
but
not
a
chance
there
always
hopin
it
ull
be
somethin
else
i
guess
when
they
see
the
same
old
thing
they
get
sore
and
try
to
step
on
your
feet
the
sargents
stand
way
behind
an
say

they
wont
hurt
you
an
then
when
they
land
on
your
corn
they
say
thats
to
bad
you
didnt
do
it
right
i
dont
like

i
dont

to
like
the
captin
much
better
ether
the
other
day
i

laffin
while

in
line
just
laffin
to

not
disturbin
nobody
the
captin
turns
round
an
says
smith

at
me
i
says

sir
an
he
says
well
what
else
was
there
to
laff
at
thats
the
kind
of
a
fello
he
is
i
did
sass
him
back
or
nothin
mable
just
looked
at
him
an
made
him
feel
cheap
i
saw
him
again
in
the
afternoon
course
i
didnt
salute
he
says
what
do
you
mean
by
not
salutin
i
told
him
i
thought
he
was
mad
im
glad
im
not
his
wife
mable
you
never
know
how
to
take
a
fello
like
that
if
i
hadnt
knowed
they
needed
me
id
have
given
him
two
weaks
notise
on
the
spot
duty
before
pleasure
though
thats
me
all
over
we
took
the
guns
out
to
drill
the
other
day
the
captin
was
talkin
about
indirect
firin
thats
the
way
he
is
nothin
straight
forward
about
him
i
asked
the
sargent
about
it
he
said
indirect
firin
was
where
you
shot
at
one
thing
an
aimed
at
another
i
hate
to
butt
in
mable
but
it
didnt
seem
right
i
says
i
seen
the
indien
girl
in
the
circus
shoot
the
spots
out
of
a
card
over
her
shoulder
but
wouldnt
it
be
more
censible
to
cut
out
the
trick
stuff
till
we
was
more
used
to
the
thing
you
cant
argue
with
sargents
though
day
after
tomorrows
inspecshun
they
do
it
every
saturday
thats
another
thing
im
thankful
for
theres
only
one
saturday
a
weak
we
pull
everything
out
an
pile
it
on
our
cots
then
the
captin
an
the
sargent
comes
in
every
time
its
the
same
he
says
thats
very
dirty
smith
wheres
your
other
shirt
an
i
say
i
aint
got
none
sir
an
he
says
sargent
make
a
note
of
that
an
then
the
sargent
rites
somethin
in
a
little
book
next
time
just
the
same
the
captin
says
wheres
my
shirt
an
the
sargent
makes
a
note
i
guess
theres
somethin
in
the
drill
regulations
what
makes
him
say
that
cause
i
aint
got
no
other
shirt
yet
well
mable
im
gettin
hungry
again
now
guess
ill
have
to
stop
an
buy
a
couple
of
pies
we
dont
get
nothin
to
eat
for
an
hour
yet
yours
till
the
ice
cracks
in
the
pale
i
had
to
borrow
a
stamp
for
this
letter
i
went
down
town
yesterday
an
spent
my
last
sent
on
a
money
belt
its
a
good
one
though
mable
rainin
today
no
drill
so
im
going
to
rite
you
if
i
dont
get
no
exercise
i
go
all
to
pieces
im
back
from
the
artillery
into
the
infantry
captin
an
i
had
different
ideas
about
runnin
things
one
of
us
had
to
leave
hed
been
there
longest
i
left
hot
headed
thats
me
all
over
were
doin
baynut
drill
now
i
cant
say
nothin
about
it
its
not
for
wimens
ears
we
have
one
place
where
we
hit
the
hun
in
the
nose
an
rip
all
the
decorashuns
offen
his
uniform
all
in
one
stroke
then
theres
another
where
you
give
him
a
shave
an
a
round
hair
cut
an
end
by
knocking
his
hat
over
his
eyes
then
the
wiperzup
come
over
with
a
lot
of
bums
an
do
the
dirty
work
i
an
the
rest
of
the
fellos
go
ahead
an
take
another
trench
i
havnt
been
able
to
find
out
yet
where
we
take
it
its
all
worked
out
cientifick
the
fello
who
doped
it
out
had
some
bean
the
principul
of
the
thing
is
to
get
the
other
fello
an
not
let
him
get
you
if
the
allys
bad
doped
out
some
skeme
like
this
the
war
would
have
been
over
now
there
wouldnt
have
been
no
huns
left
it
takes
us
uncle
sammies
eh
mable
illustration
one
day
it
our
teeth
there
gettin
up
a
thrift
campain
now
mable
first
they
sell
us
enough
liberty
bonds
to
buy
a
brand
new
army
an
let
us
go
home
then
they
cram
a
lot
of
insurence
at
you
what
wont
never
do
you
no
good
after
your
killed
then
i
guess
they
found
that
someone
still
had
a
couple
of
dollars
left
so
they
made
us
send
that
back
home
now
there
gettin
up
a
thrift
campain
mable
they
dont
want
us
to
spend
our
money
foolish
sos
we
can
buy
the
singer
buildin
or
a
ford
or
somethin
like
that
when
the
war
is
over
some
one
say
that
we
was
the
highest
payed
army
in
the
world
besides
all
this
money
we
get
our
bed
and
board
i
guess
they
dont
know
that
in
the
army
bed
and
board
mean
the
same
thing
eh
mable
still
the
same
old
bill
there
always
inspectin
us
i
feel
like
a
piece
of
prize
beef
they
never
inspect
a
man
all
the
way
through
i
guess
the
inspecters
get
payed
by
the
day
durin
the
duration
of
the
inspecshun
one
day
its
our
teeth
an
another
our
heart
an
another
our
lungs
the
other
day

all
lined
up
in
the
company
street

the
sargent
says

lays
down
my

rest
of
the
day

through
the
winter
illustration
remember
me
to
your
mother
mable
thats
french
i
didnt
expect
you
to
kno
what
it
meant
though
the
are
learnin
me
french
now
i
only
had
three
lessons
so
far
but
i
can
talk
it
pretty
good
you
know
how
quick
i
am
at
pickin
up
any
kind
of
trick
stuff
like
that
the
only
difference
between
french
and
english
is
that
there
pretty
near
alike
but
the
french
dont
pronounce
there
words
right
when
i
use
french
words
ill
underline
them
thatll
give
you
some
idea
of
the
languige
when
we
get
voila
as
the
french
say
for
over
there
itll
come
handy
to
be
able
to
sit
down
and
have
a
dosy
dos
with
them
poilus
that
means
chew
the
rag
in
english
a
poilus
mable
is
a
french
peasant
girl
an
they
say
that
they
are
very
belle
now
do
mispronounce
things
an
get
sore
till
you
know
you
pronounce
that
like
the
bell
in
push
button
it
means
good
lookers
there
crazy
about
us
fellos
they
call
us
sammies
they
named
one
of
there
rivers
for
us
you
have
heard
of
the
battle
of
the
samme
but
i
dont
suppose
you
have
they
have
been
learnin
us
a
lot
about
gas
at
attacks
lately
these
are
not
the
kind
your
father
has
these
are
more
like
the
open
places
in
the
street
on
avenoo
only
in
the
army
when
anything
like
this
happens
they
give
you
a
gas
mask
a
gas
mask
is
like
a
cracked
ice
bag
with
windos
in
it
an
in
the
front
they
got
a
cigaret
holder
i
always
heard
how
the
french
was
cigaret
feends
i
guess
it
got
so
bad
they
put
in
the
holders
sos
they
could
smoke
during
a
gas
attack
im
goin
to
put
on
my
mask
an
have
my
pictur
took
en
cabinet
thats
nothin
to
do
with
furniture
mable
its
the
french
for
what
its
goin
to
look
like
when
its
done
the
gas
fello
said
the
other
day
that
gas
was
perfectly
safe
cause
you
could
always
tell
when
it
was
comin
you
could
hear
it
escape
or
see
it
or
smell
it
the
only
trouble
was
he
said
that
when
the
gas
started
the
machine
guns
made
so
much
noise
you
couldnt
hear
it
an
it
always
came
at
night
sos
you
couldnt
see
it
and
when
you
smelled
it
it
was
most
to
late
to
bother
anyhow
i
been
thinkin
that
over
seems
to
me
theres
a
joker
in
the
contract
somewhere
ask
your
father
to
read
it
over
an
see
if
it
sound
droit
thats
french
for
right
to
him
better
still
ask
higgins
the
grocer
to
give
it
the
once
over
hes
got
a
grand
tete
as
the
french
say
when
they
mean
brains
illustration
not
the
kind
your
father
has
illustration
i
wear
them
every
night
over
my
uniform
its
getting
frappayer
and
frappayer
down
here
meaning
colder
and
colder
it
got
so
cold
that
i
put
on
those
sox
that
you
nitted
me
i
guess
i
wont

more
though
i
guess
my
feet
are
going
to
look
like
corderoy
the
rest
of
my
life
youll
understand
no
hard
feelin
i
know
you
know
how
delicate
my
feet
is
an
how
i
cant
afford
to
prennez
a
hazard
with
them
thank
your
mother
for
the
flannel
pajammas
i
wear
them
every
night
over
my
uniform
i
got
to
quit

an
read
some
pictur
post
cards
that
some
girls

or
as
the
french
say
robe
de
nuit
mable
i
havnt
rote
for
some
time
because
i
been
made
an
a
corperal
i
admit
i
deserved
it
i
didnt
apply
for
it
or
nothin
though
they
just
come
and
told
me
bein
corperal
means
i
dont
have
nothin
more
to
do
with
details
an
at
the
same
time
i
got
more
details
than
ever
thats
a
sort
of
a
joke
that
us
military
men
understand
you
couldnt
get
it
probably
mable
its
tecknickle
yesterday
being
sunday
me
an
a
couple
of
other
officers
borrowed
a
couple
of
mules
from
the
stable
sargent
an
went
for
a
ride
we
saw
a
cabin
that
they
said
was
a
moonshiners
hut
but
it
was
broad
daylight
so
you
couldnt
tell
of
course
its
still
cold
i
wish
thed
hurry
up
and
issue
those
gas
masks
theyd
come
in
handy
these
cold
nights
the
sargent
told
me
that
i
was
goin
to

guess
im
lucky
to
get
indoor
work
this
wether
illustration
i
been
made
an
officer
illustration
somebodied
set
a
trunk
on
the
turky
you

such
a
place
for
roomors
these
are
army
roomors
they
havnt
got
nothin
to
do
with
the
kind
your
mother
used
to
take
in
we
here
that

week
an
that

not

goin
to
be
used
to
guard
the
chicago
stock
yards
then
we
here
that
all
the
mounted
men
are
goin
to
be
dismounted
an
all
the
dismounted
men
are
goin
to
be
mounted
an
that
the
rest
of
us
are
goin
to
be
made
cooks
an
we
here

tell
what
is
goin
on
i
got
your
thanksgivin
box
two
days
ago
it
was
only
ten
days
late
i
guess
the
post
office
must
have
made
some
mistake
things
is
usually
later
than
that
it
was
in
good
shape
except
that
the
insides
had
been
squoze
out
of
the
mince
pie
and
somebodied
set
a
trunk
on
the
turky
of
course
i
divided
it
up
with
my
squad
big
hearted
thats
me
all
over
im
awful
popular
with
my
men
they
offen
say
they
wish
id
be
made
a
major
or
somethin
my
men
ate
up
all
the
stuff
all
i
saved
for
my
self
was
the
white
meat
an
half
a
mince
pie
it
certainly
tastes
good
in
the
field
of
course
we
aint
in
nobodies
field
thats
a
military
expreshun
i
cant
explain
it
i
got
to
quit
now
an
post
a
guard
at
the
same
time
ill
post
this
letter
to
you
thats
a
joke
mable
im
sorry
this
letter
cant
be
longer
but
as
a
man
rises
in
the
army
he
gets
less
an
less
time
to
hisself
olive
oil
yours
faithlessly
cherry
mable
thats
the
way
the
french
begin
there
love
letters
its
perfectly
proper
i
would
have
rote
you
sooner
but
me
an
my
fountin
pens
been
froze
for
a
week
washington
will
never
know
how
lucky
he
was
that
he
got
assigned
to
valley
forge
instead
of
here
it
got
us
out
of
drill
for
a
couple
of
days
thats
somethin
i
guess
id
rather
freeze
than
drill
its
awful
when
they
make
you
do
both
though
two
of
my
men
has
gone
home
on
furlos
me
bein
corperal
i
took
all
there
blankets
the
men
didnt
like
it
but
i
got
a
squad
of
men
to
look
out
for
an
my
first
duty
is
to
keep
fit
duty
first
thats
me
all
over
i
got
so
many
blankets
now
that
i
got
to
put
a
book
mark
in
the
place
i
get
in
at
night
or
id
never
find
it
again
we
spent
most
of
our
time
tryin
to
find
somethin
to
burn
up
in
the
sibly
stoves
a
sibly
stove
mable
is
a
piece
of
stove
pipe
built
like
the
leg
of
a
sailurs
trowsers
old
man
sibly
must
have
had
a
fine
mind
to
think
it
out
all
by
hisself
they
say
he
got
a
patent
on
it
i
guess
that
must
have
been
a
slack
winter
in
washington
the
government
gives
us
our
wood
but
i
guess
that
the
man
who
decided
how
much
it
was
goin
to
give
us
had
an
office
in
the
sandwitch
islands
i
says
the
other
day
that
if
theyd
dip
our
allowance
in
fusfrus
wed
at
least
have
matches
eh
mable
im
the
same
old
bill
mable
crackin
jokes
an
keepin
everybody
laffin
when
things
is
blackest
illustration
built
like
the
leg
of
a
sailurs
trowsers
i
was
scoutin
round
for
wood
today
an
burned
up
those
military
hair
brushes
your
mother
gave
me
when
we
came
away
i
told
her
theyd
come
in
mighty
handy
some
day
they
say
a
fello
tried
to
take
a
shouer
the
other
day
before
he
could
get
out
it
froze
round
him
like
that
fello
in
the
bible
who
turned
into
a
pillo
of
salt
they
had
to
break
the
whole
thing
offen
the
pipe
with
him
inside
it
an
stand
it
in
front
of
the
stove
when
it
melted
he
finished
his
shouer
an
said
he
felt
fine
thats
how
hard
were
gettin
mable
i
bought
a
book
on
minor
tackticks
the
other
day
thats
not
about
underaged
tacks
that
live
on
ticks
as
you
might
suppose
mable
its
the
cience
of
movin
bodies
of
men
from
one
place
to
another
i
thought
it
might
tell
of
some
way
of
gettin
the
squad
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
but
it
doesnt
all
the
important
stuff
like
that
is
camooflaged
sos
the
germans
wont
get
onto
it
camooflage
is
not
a
new
kind
of
cheese
mable
its
a
military
term
camooflage
is
french
for
cauliflower
which
is
a
disguised
cabbage
it
is
the
same
thing
as
puttin
powder
on
your
face
instead
of
washin
it
you
deceive
germans

herd
a
fello

for
me
christmas
morning
was
potatoes
an
the
only
thing
what
rung
out
was

familiar
enough
with
the
poets
to
get
that
mable
it
shows
that
i
can
be
funny
an
bright
though
even
under
adversary
conditions
kitchen
police
dont
explain
what
i
do
very
well
i
dont
walk

beet
or
carry
a

do
kitchen
police
for

of
days
she
wouldnt
be
quitten

could
come
down
we
celebrated
christmas
by
sleepin
till
a
quarter
to
seven
instead
of
hap
past
six
only
they

flowers
anywhere
you

morning
then
i
figgered
it

a
silly
idea
in
the
first
place
theyd

the
way
an
then
you
cant
get
enough
flowers

one
of

good
smell

salutin
officers
so
fast
it
looked
like
we
was
scratchin
our
forheds
an
every
time
we
saluted
she
bowed
i
didnt
say
nothin
cause
after
all
she
was
payin
for
the
dinner
later
on
though
she
says
i
think
its
fine
you

made
so
many
friends
among
the
officers
cause
i
think

such
nice
men
can
you
beat
it
mable
an
when
she
went
home
she
sent
max
an
officers
hat
cord

the
way
a
french

any
more
i
was
just
goin
to

anyways
the
captins

watchin
me

an
he
didnt
like
it
he
knew
i
knew
more
than
him
as
well
as

always
askin
me
questions
id
always
tell
him
cause
i
knew
he

city
an
so
i
was
sorry
for
them
soft
thats
me
all
over
but
the
other
day
when
i
was
on
guard
he
says
corperal
whats
the
general
orders
an
i
says
captin
if
you

them
now
you
never
will
and
i
wouldnt
be
doin
no
service
to
my
country
if

but
civil
mable
you
kno
how
i
can
be
the
captin
just
felt
cheap
an
walked
away
i
kind
of
felt
sorry
for
him
almost
told
him
so
once
or
twice
then
i
went
on
guard
again
i
go
on
guard
a
lot
the
men
like
me
to
be
corperal
of
the
guard
because
when
the
relief
goes
out
i
take
all
their
blankets
an
go
right
to
sleep
instead
of
standin
outside
an
watchin
them
freeze
men
hate
to
be
watched
while
they
are
freezin
illustration
men
hate
to
be
watched
while
they
are
freezin
but
i
happened
to
be
outside
for
some
reason
goin
to
dinner
i
guess
an
i
saw
the
colonel
coming
i
says
turn
out
the
guard
no
one
really
turns
em
out
mable
they
come
out
themselves
the
colonel
sees
who
it
is
an
waves
an
says
never
mind
the
guard
corperal
so
i
thanks
him
an
goes
back
to
the
company
an
goes
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
captin
sees
that
the
colonel
is
savin
me
up
for
over
there
he
gets
sore
his
plan
has
been
to
kill
me
before
we
left
here
he
said
he
was
goin
to
reduce
me
thats
not
the
same
way
your
father
reduces
when
he
cuts
out
beer
with
his
meals
an
sits
in
a
turkish
all
day
i
never
said
you
will
or
you
wont
just
waited
till
he
got
outside
an
thumbed
my
nose
at
him
high
spirited
thats
me
all
over
an
english
officer
came
over
the
other
day
an
told
us
all
about
the
war
he
didnt
quite
finish
it
cause
he
only
had
three
quarters
of
an
hour
they
was
quite
a
few
things
i
didnt
kno
even
at
that
he
said
that
the
heavy
artillery
was
commanded
by
the
an
the
light
artillery
by
the
an
theres
a
special
who
has
nothin
to
do
but
look
after
the
just
imagine
mable
i
wish
id
studied
chemistree
more
when
i
was
in
school
it
would
make
things
a
lot
easier
for
me
now
then
he
said
that
a
man
always
got
into
his
to
observe
the
action
of
the
these
english
are
always
great
for
dress
an
that
formal
stuff
im
glad
there
tellin
us
this
before
we
go
over
it
would
have
been
awful
embarassing
to
have
tried
to
observe
the
action
of
the
in
my
i
asked
him
if
they
had
any
trouble
with
the
when
he
left
he
said
cheero
without
winkin
a
hair
i
says
beevo
same
old
bill
eh
mable
they
said
the
other
day
that
my
name
was
on
a
list
to
go
to
school
an
learn
all
about
liason
i
said
there
wasnt
much
use
in
there
doin
that
cause
i
was
pretty
well
up
on
that
stuff
at
home
i
says
i
had
a
reputashun
for
a
devil
with
the
wimen
nobody
knows
better
than
you
eh
mable
i
guess
thats
a
little
over
your
head
though
mable
i
try
to
be
as
simple
as
i
can
if
im
not
just
tell
me
im
ritin
this
letter
with
my
shoes

havin
the
old
trouble
with
my
feet

right
since
that
winter
i

to
dance
i
went
to
the
doctor
with
them
an
he
said
to
keep
offen
them
as
much
as
i
could
so
they
put
me
to
work
scrubbin
the
mess
shack
on
my
hans
and
nees
i
bet
if
a
fello
had
both
legs
shot
off
theyd
prop
you
up
against
the
wall
an
put
you
peelin
onions

to

proud
of

havnt
got
much
room
for
that
kind
of
thing
down
here
yours
exclusively
mable
everyone
round
here
is
goin
to
school
now
so
they
can
be
speshulists
not
the
kind
your
mother
goes
to
mable
a
speshulist
only
does
one
thing
i
been
doin
everything
round
here
ever
since
i
came
i
was
gettin
sick
of
it
i
went
to
the
top
sargent
an
says
i
guessed
id
be
a
speshulist
to
he
said
all
right
hed
make
me
a
food
speshulist
said
id
have
to
go
into
it
pretty
deep
i
been
into
it
up
to
my
elbows
in
the
kitchen
ever
since
never
trust
sargents
least
of
all
top
sargents
if
it
keeps
on
like
this
there
wont
be
nobody
to
do
the
actual
fightin
but
me
mable
its
too
much
responsibilety
for
one
man
suppose
i
was
to
get
sick
or
somethin
an
then
a
bunch
of
fellos
went
away
to
lern
to
be
officers
that
kind
of
struck
my
fancy
it
bein
about
the
only
thing
i
hadnt
done
round
here
i
went
to
the
captin
an
told
him
i
thought
id
go
to
he
said
i
could
go
to
and
then
he
added
somethin
illustration
it
seemed
to
depres
them
awful
he
said
a
company
was
built
up
somethin
like
a
man
there
was
the
brain
which
was
the
officers
an
then
some
was
the
muscle
an
some
was
the
bone
he
said
i
seemed
to
be
pretty
well
fitted
for
my
part
by
nature
so
he
wouldnt
change
me
ive
always
been
strong
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
mable
ive
rote
a
pome
i
sent
it
to
the
divisun
paper
they
wouldnt
print
it
cause
they
said
it
was
so
real
that
it
might
depres
the
men
i
guess
they
was
right
cause
i
read
it
to
the
fellos
in
the
tent
an
it
seemed
to
depres
them
awful
im
ritin
it
to
you
its
about
the
war
youll
probably
notice
that
yourself
if
you
read
it
careful
here
it
is
i
here
the
thunder
of
the
guns
smashin
down
the
german
huns
an
the
sticky
pools
of
gory
blood
soakin
up
the
oozie
sod
the
rushin
roarin
shreekin
boom
of
bullets
crashin
thru
the
gloom
ii
listen
to
those
grate
bums
bust
on
the
quiverin
hunnish
crust
listen
to
the
shreekin
moanin
swearin
yellin
gruntin
groanin
that
comes
to
us
across
the
trenches
all
mixed
up
with
grusome
stenches
iii
biff
an
from
there
hellish
lare
the
shreeks
of
germans
rent
the
air
bloody
lims
lie
on
the
ground
bits
of
huns
go
flyin
round
bang
and
through
the
cannons
roar
is
plainly
herd
the
splashin
gore
iv
but
this
can
not
go
on
for
long
cause
uncle
sam
is
comin
strong
an
when
we
charge
the
german
line
we
chuck
the
dam
thing
in
the
rine
an
blood
an
slauter
rape
an
gore
in
bel
le
france
will
rain
no
more
aint
that
terrible
mable
i
read
it
to
one
fello
an
he
said
it
made
him
absolutely
sick
he
said
he
did
see
how
i
could
rite
it
without
gettin
sick
myself
just
between
me
an
you
mable
i
did
come
pretty
near
being
once
or
twice
when
i
was
ritin
it
illustration
if
i
catch
one
of
those
ailin
enemies
windin
up
your
victrola
most
of
all
thats
confidential
but
i
dont
care
if
you
read
it
to
some
of
your
friends
just
to
give
em
a
good
idea
of
what
war
is
some
of
the
things
aint
very
nice
of
course
if
your
ritin
big
stuff
though
you
got
to
put
in
everything
that
comes
into
your
head
or
else
you
lose
the
punch
i
think
the
ends
the
best
a
lot
of
fellos
has
said
that
we
ought
to
have
more
of
that
it
gets
the
slackers
the
rine
is
a
german
river
where
they
make
wine
near
berlin
mable
you
keep
menshuning
a
fello
named
broggins
in
your
letters
now
i
aint
got
a
spark
of
jelusy
in
my
nature
big
thats
me
all
over
mable
but
i
warn
you
frankly
if
i
ever
catch
one
of
those
ailin
enemies
windin
up
your
victrola
ill
kick
him
out
of
the
house
thats
only
fair
it
that
i
care
a
snap
theres
plenty
of
girls
waitin
for
me
its
just
the
principul
of
the
thing
dont
think
for
a
minit
that
i
care
i
just
menshun
it
cause
i
couldnt
think
of
nothin
else
to
say
yours
till
you
here
otherwise
de
mon
oie
you
say
that
like
oie
yoy
in
yiddish
it
means
apple
of
my
eye
i
never
saw
an
apple
in
nobodys
eye
mable
but
i
guess
thats
some
french
custom
great
news
mable
a
fello
whats
got
a
friend
in
the
audience
department
in
washington
just
told
me
the
wars
goin
to
end
about
the
of
dont
say
nothin
to
nobody
about
it
it
might
look
as
if
i
was
gettin
mixed
up
in
politiks
i
put
in
for
a
furlo
on
the
tho
then
i
wont
have
to
come
back
eh
mable
ill
bet
your
glad
its
great
to
think
of
gettin
into
a
place
where
you
cant
see
through
the
walls
and
there
aint
three
inches
of
mud
on
the
floor
an
think
of
not
havin
to
tie
the
doors
together
when
you
come
in
or
crawl
underneath
em
on
your
hans
and
nees
and
not
havin
to
put
everything
you
own
in
the
world
under
the
bed
but
i
guess
you
dont
care
as
much
about
these
things
as
i
will
this
would
be
a
good
trainin
camp
for
artik
explorers
i
bet
the
fello
that
picks
out
the
camps
ether
owns
a
cold
storage
plant
in
civil
life
or
else
they
do
it
by
mail
order
it
got
so
cold
the
other
night
the
silver
in
the
thermometer
disappeared
it
aint
been
seen
since
illustration
stuck
my
head
out
of
the
blankets
we
got
a
comical
guy
in
the
tent
bill
huggins
me
an
hims
a
pair
keep
everybody
laffin
all
the
time
bill
likes
things
hot
about
as
well
as
me
every
nite
he
fills
the
sibly
stove
so
full
of
wood
that
he
has
to
hammer
the
last
piece
in
it
gets
so
hot
that
it
jumps
up
and
down
like
a
mad
monkey
thats
the
way
siblys
do
when
they
get
awful
hot
were
not
bothered
by
that
much
though
we
got
another
guy
thats
a
fresh
air
feend
his
name
is
angus
mackenzie
hes
scotch
hes
so
close
himself
that
he
has
to
have
lots
of
air
or
hed
smother
every
nite
he
pulls
up
the
side
of
the
tent
by
his
bed
no
one
likes
fresh
air
in
its
place
better
than
me
mable
but
when
its
as
fresh
as
this
air
is
its
place
is
outside
i
wake
up
in
the
nite
rolled
into
a
ball
like
a
porkypine
theys
things
in
the
middle
of
my
back
like
his
stickers
if
i
dont
move
i
get
cramps
if
i
do
i
freeze
all
around
the
place
where
im
lyin
is
as
warm
as
a
park
bench
in
winter
sometimes
i
forget
and
push
my
feet
down
that
awful
one
night
i
thought
i
heard
the
horn
and
stuck
my
head
out
of
the
blankets
it
was
angus
with
his
head
and
one
arm

has
his
pictur
in

sunday
paper
i
froze
my
ear
before

some
says
that

off
when
he
gets
into

think
his
skin
is
furlined
you
can
hear
him
smashin
the
ice
in
the
pale
with
a
hair
brush
outside
then
you
can
tell
hes
washin
by
the
noise
he
makes
like
a
busted
steam
pipe
then
he
comes
smashin
into
the
tent
leavin
the
door
open
and
wipes
the
ice
off
en
his
face
with
somebody
elses

an
awful
start

one
of
them
picturs
of
hungry
indiens
that

mishunaries
show
you
just
before
they
pass
the
plate
bill
huggins

so
fat
cause
he
couldnt
go
home
on
a
furlo
like
that
he
didnt
eat
nothin
for
three
meals
and
then
he
looked
at
hisseif
with
the
mirror
turned
the
other
way
its
like
one
of
those
coney
island
places
where
a
fello
can
go
in
and
laff
at
hisself
for
a
dime
next
time
send
me
one
that

break
i

a
couple
of
pies
before

dont
sleep
good
less
i
have
a
little
somethin
on
my
stummick
dont
say
nothin
about
what
i
told
you
in
the
beginnin
until
the
then
yours
faithfully
mable
the
captin
aint
goin
to
give
me
my
furlo
says
theres
an
order
out
against
it
someones
got
it
in
for
me
mable
i
bought
a
wooley
coat
awful
cheap
from
bill
huggins
right
away
theres
an
order
against
em
angus
mackenzie
sold
me
a
pair
of
leather
leggins
for
less
than
he
paid
for
them
some
bargain
from
angus
the
next
day
they
issue
an
order
that
you
cant
wear
em
now
they
hear
i
want
to
go
home
an
put
an
order
out
against
it
if
theyd
only
come
right
out
an
say
bill
smith
were
goin
to
get
you
sneaky
thats
what
i
call
it
mable
ive
half
a
mind
to
transfer
back
to
the
artillery
if
i
transfer
much
more
theyll
be
chargin
me
extra
fare
eh
mable
only
for
me
an
the
captin
not
bein
able
to
agree
id
never
have
left
i
understand
hes
been
awful
sorry
since
all
you
have
to
do
in
artillery
is
to
put
a
bullet
in
the
gun
it
does
the
rest
in
the
infantry
you
got
to
go
up
and
do
all
the
dirty
work
yourself
illustration
they
come
round
and
watch
you
eat
it
besides
im
gettin
leery
of
these
infantry
fellos
there
always
talking
about
what
were
goin
to
do
to
the
germans
blowin
em
to
pieces
and
slicin
em
up
an
throwin
em
all
around
the
lot
i
got
thinkin
what
if
the
germans
was
learnin
there
men
to
do
the
same
thing
they
never
seem
to
figger
on
these
things
an
these
baynuts
mable
they
aint
safe
when
you
get
a
lot
of
fellos
in
a
trench
with
there
baynuts
stickin
every
which
way
some
ones
goin
to
get
hurt
sure
i
got
those
cigars
your
father
sent
me
thank
him
an
tell
him
if
he
ever
gets
takin
like
that
again
not
to
send
such
a
large
box
you
explain
it
to
him
mable
you
can
do
that
sort
of
thing
much
better
than
i
can
outspoken
thats
me
all
over
mable
why
is
it
that
no
matter
how
fussy
a
fello
was
when
he
wore
a
vest
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
call
a
coat
a
blouze
no
one
thinks
he
knows
whats
what
if
you
got
any
old
magazenes
what
was
old
before
the
war
started
send
em
to
the
soldiers
they
wont
know
the
difference
some
wimen
sent
our
regiment
the
baptist
review
for
three
years
back
that
aint
right
mable
they
give
you
candy
that
comes
by
the
bale
then
they
come
round
an
watch
you
eat
it
i
bet
if
you
walked
into
there
place
an
watched
them
eat
theyd
raise
an
awful
holler
they
make
speeches
to
you
that
youd
get
your
money
back
without
askin
up
north
they
give
you
free
movies
thats
so
old
they
look
as
if
they
was
taken
in
the
rain
it
seems
like
feedin
the
hippo
at
the
zoo
mable
it
dont
matter
so
much
as
long
as
theres
lots
of
it
im
goin
into
town
tonite
with
a
bunch
to
eat
a
swell
dinner
on
a
china
plate
all
but
angus
mackenzie
he
eats
all
his
dinners
on
me
im
awful
sick
of
eatin
out
of
a
tin
fryin
pan
when
you
put
food
in
it
it
folds
up
like
a
jacknife
goin
the
wrong
way
it
takes
months
to
make
a
good
mess
kit
eater
we
get
our
mess
from
some
fellos
what
stands
behind
a
counter
one
of
them
divides
the
coffee
he
does
it
by
puttin
half
in
your
cup
an
half
on
your
thumb
the
other
fellos
has
big
spoons
i
guess
they
are
old
lacross
players
a
big
wad
of
food
hits
your
plate
splash
an
knocks
it
squee
gee
the
other
fello
hits
the
other
plate
an
knocks
it
the
other
way
when
you
get
it
all
its
runnin
out
of
one
dish
up
your
sleeve
an
out
of
the
other
back
into
the
food
pans
army
food
always
runs
cooks
love
loose
grub
there
awful
stupid
if
theres
anything
solid
you
get
it
in
the
pan
with
the
rim
on
it
then
they
pour
the
soup
on
your
cover
when
you
sit
down
half
what
you
got
left
spills
out
on
the
table
it
isnt
so
bad
now
cause
everything
freezes
about
as
soon
as
it
hits
illustration
army
food
always
runs
you
ought
to
see
us
eat
breakfast
mable
we
got
so
many
overcoats
and
things
on
that
a
fello
dont
get
no
elbow
action
some
fellos
eats
with
there
wool
gloves
that
aint
a
good
scheme
though
it
makes
things
taste
like
eatin
peaches
with
there
skins
on
the
fello
that
invented
our
eatin
tables
must
have
been
a
supply
sargent
once
all
the
seats
is
nailed
to
the
table
when
you
get
a
spoonful
of
loose
food
up
some
fello
puts
his
foot
in
your
lap
and
leaves
a
couple
of
pounds
of
mud
there
i

brush
it
off

hes
an
awful
smart
fello
the
cook
hes
got
a
bet
on
that
if
the
allys
dont
buck
up
an
win
the
germans
is
comin
out
ahead
max
glucos
a
fello
in
the
tent
is
refere
were
all
eatin
as
fast
as
we
can
perhaps
we
can
eat
it
all
in
less
than
ten
days
so
maybe
well
be
gone
mable
before
i
rite
you
from
here
again
theres
a
french
sargent
comes
round
once
in
a
while
an
says
the
war
is
goin
to
be
over
quick
he
ought
to
know
cause
hes
been
over
there
an
seen
the
whole
thing
he
smokes
cigarets
something
awful
an
dont
say
much
thats
because
the
poor
cus
cant
talk
much
english
it
must
be
awful
not
to
talk
english
think
of
not
bein
able
to
say
nothin
all
your
life
without
wavin
your
arms
round
an
then
lookin
it
up
in
a
dickshunary
illustration
he
smokes
cigarets
something
awful
i
feel
so
sorry
for
these
fellos
that
im
studiin
french
a
lot
harder
sos
theyll
have
someone
to
talk
to
when
we
get
over
there
im
readin
a
book
now
thats
rote
all
in
french
no
english
in
it
anywhere
mable
a
fello
told
me
that
was
the
only
way
to
talk
it
good
i
dont
understand
it
very
well
so
far
the
only
way
i
kno
its
french
is
by
the
picturs
some
day
im
goin
to
find
out
what
the
name
is
then
im
goin
to
get
the
english
of
it
those
are
some
picturs
aint
i
fierce
mable
i
guess
thats
why
i
get
on
with
wimen
so
well
i
gave
up
readin
it
out
loud
cause
the
fellos
said
it
made
em
think
they
was
in
paris
so
much
they
got
restles
i
cant
speak
no
better
yet
i
guess
that
comes
all
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
book
as
soon
as
we
got
the
hot
shouers
all
fixed
the
pipes
busted
so
the
other
day
the
captin
walked
us
all
in
town
to
take
a
bath
i
didnt
need
one
much
i
used
my
head
more
than
most
of
em
last
fall
when
it
was
warm
i
took
as
many
as
two
a
week
an
got
away
ahead
of
the
game
i
went
along
though
more
for
the
walk
than
anything
i
saw
the
captin
didnt
make
no
move
to
take
a
bath
hisself
i
thought
he
might
be
shy
he
dont
mix
very
well
with
the
fellos
i
felt
sorry
for
him
everyone
else
was
laffin
an
throwin
things
with
him
standin
off
an
noone
throwin
a
thing
at
him
i
went
up
an
says
aint
you
goin
to
take
a
bath
this
winter
to
captin
just
jolly
mable
that
all
i
says
you
dont
want
to
mind
the
bunch
they
dont
care
a
bit
there
as
dirty
as
you
are
anyway
probably
more
an
i
bet
they
were
mable
cause
i
aint
seen
the
captin
do
a
stroke
of
work
since
we
come
here
just
stands
round
givin
orders
i
says
if
noone
wont
lend
you
a
towel
you
can
use
mine
i
was
just
goin
to
have
it
washed
anyway
he
got
awful
red
and
embarassed
mable
i
thought
he
was
goin
to
choke
hes
awful
queer
just
like
the
other
mornin
he
calls
me
over
an
says
smith
my
orderlies
sick
you
can
shine
my
boots
this
mornin
he
said
it
like
id
been
beggin
him
to
for
a
month
an
then
he
says
smith
you
can
lite
the
fire
in
my
stove
he
had
me
thinkin
he
was
doin
me
favors
he
said
i
might
put
some
oil
on
his
boots
if
i
wished
i
says
that
would
be
a
great
treat
an
i
wished
he
wouldnt
be
so
kind
or
the
fellos
would
think
he
was
playin
favorites
i
guess
he
didnt
here
me
mable
cause
hed
just
gone
out
i
said
it
anyway
i
didnt
care
if
he
wasnt
there
spunky
thats
me
all
over
illustration
i
poured
some
oil
out
of
his
lamp
i
couldnt
find
no
oil
for
his
boots
anywhere
mable
so
i
poured
some
out
of
his
lamp
an
then
i
dont
think
that
suited
him
queer
fello
the
captin
i
keep
herein
more
about
this
fello
broggins
i
suppose
he
belongs
to
the
home
guards
an
wares
his
uniform
round
in
the
evenin
an
i
suppose
he
has
an
american
flag
on
his
ritin
paper
it
dont
mean
nothin
in
my
life
i
aint
goin
to
put
up
no
arguments
or
get
nasty
like
most
fellos
would
dignity
thats
me
all
over
mable
let
me
tell
you
though
if
i
ever
come
home
and
find
him
shinin
his
elbos
on
the
top
of
your
baby
grand
ill
kick
him
down
the
front
steps
if
i
only
have
one
leg
to
do
it
with
im
ritin
this
in
the
in
the
afternoon
cause
im
goin
on
guard
tonite
i
dont
see
why
they
dont
make
it
a
permenant
detail
and
be
done
with
it
someone
said
the
top
sargents
a
man
of
one
idea
i
guess
im
the
idea
i
didnt
go
out
to
drill
this
afternoon
i
didnt
say
nothin
to
the
sargent
though
cause
sargents
have
an
idea
that
if
they
dont
get
a
lot
of
fellos
to
go
out
to
drill
with
them
they
dont
look
popular
i
got
to
go
new
sos
to
get
in
my
tent
before
they
come
from
drill
as
ever
on
guard
mable
i
would
have
rote
sooner
but
i
had
such
a
cold
i
couldnt
say
nothin
for
most
a
weak
well
mable
we
et
all
the
food
like
the
cook
said
but
we
aint
in
france
yet
i
guess
he
aint
got
as
many
brains
as
he
said
he
had
everyone
is
sore
at
him
cause
we
didnt
kick
at
none
of
his
food
for
more
than
a
weak
thinkin
that
when
wed
et
it
all
wed
go
away
he
thinks
its
funny
an
says
do
youse
guys
think
this
war
is
a
cooks
tour
i
hate
fellos
what
tries
to
get
out
of
things
by
bein
smart
everythings
covered
with
mud
includin
me
i
seem
to
attract
mud
like
i
was
a
maggot
mable
yesterday
i
spent
all
the
afternoon
shinin
up
for
guard
sos
to
be
the
colonels
orderly
then
i
step
out
of
the
tent
and
flui
the
sargent
says
smith

go
on
guard
lookin
like
that
i
even
got
mud
in
my
hair
max
glucos
says
when
he
combs
his
its
like
rakin
out
a
garden
from
what
i
seen
of
him
though
i
dont
see
how
he
found
out
illustration
i
even
got
mud
in
my
hair
illustration
the
water
comes
through
on
me
its
pourin
rain
an
awful
cold
its
so
cold
that
the
tooth
past
rolls
right
offen
your
brush
in
the
morning
the
captin
has
a
cold
in
his
nose
he
says
he
wont
take
the
men
out
in
such
bad
wether
as
today
taint
nothin
gainst
him
mable
but
i
hope
he
has
a
cold
all
winter
theres
a
hole
in
the
tent
over
my
cot
where
the
water
comes
through
on
me
i
put
a
slicker
over
me
last
nite
the
water
made
puddles
in
it
then
when
i
turned
over
they
spilt
out
into
my
shoes
this
had
me
guessin
mable
till
finally
i
put
max
glucoses
shoes
there
instead
of
mine
angus
mackenzie
had
so
many
holes
over
his
cot
that
it
looked
like
one
of
those
safety
fire
sprinklers
he
got
up
last
nite
and
rigged
his
shelter
half
sos
the
water
hit
it
an
run
down
onto
the
next
cot
hes
a
brite
fello
angus
even
if
he
is
a
forener
the
other
day
he
had
some
medecine
for
a
cold
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
it
was
per
cent
alcohol
he
drank
the
whole
thing
right
down
sos
nobody
couldnt
get
hold
of
it
it
made
him
awful
sick
but
he
says
thats
because
he
isnt
used
to
it
for
such
a
long
time
me
an
hims
goin
down
next
week
to
put
in
a
stock
of
tonics
its
awful
hard
to
rite
letters
mable
somebodys
always
fallin
over
your
feet
or
draggin
something
wet
over
the
paper
if
youve
got
a
cot
near
the
door
like
mine
is
an
when
you
get
goin
finally
at
about
the
fourth
try
some
sargent
always
comes
in
with
a
list
and
makes
you
check
up
something
sometimes
i
go
over
to
the
mable
but
as
soon
as
you
get
ritin
a
bald
headed
fello
jumps
up
an
says
now
fellos
well
all
sing
all
the
fellos
whats
ritin
looks
up
an
says
aw
one
thing
and
another
i
dont
know
who
the
bald
headed
fello
is
they
got
one
in
every
they
all
look
about
alike
i
guess
there
a
regular
issue
theys
always
a
bunch
of
fellos
what
dont
seem
to
kno
why
they
came
they
all
start
singin
then
i
cant
rite
no
more
or
do
nothin
so
i
come
home
an
go
to
bed
independent
thats
me
all
over
mable
most
of
the
taxis
is
swalowed
up
in
the
mud
theys
only
two
or
three
runnin
now
only
the
big
strong
fellos
can
get
to
town
the
cook
says
its
the
old
theory
of
the
arrival
of
the
fittest
but
i
guess
you
dont
know
nothin
about
cience
mable
when
i
go
to
town
i
wrap
my
blouze
in
a
newspaper
if
they
know
your
goin
they
give
you
a
list
of
things
to
get
that
looks
like
a
chinese
message
to
congress
by
the
time
you
go
to
come
home
you
got
so
many
bundles
you
look
like
one
of
those
fellos
in
the
funny
papers
everyone
stands
in
the
square
lookin
like
a
hat
rack
waitin
for
the
three
taxis
to
come
along
when
they
see
one
they
rush
it
like
they
do
in
the
movies
when
the
milunares
cars
runs
over
the
poor
fellos
kid
if
goin
over
the
top
is
any
worse
than
gettin
under
the
top
of
one
of
them
things
with
fifty
bundles
an
as
many
fellos
then
sherman
didnt
know
many
swear
words
eh
mable
but
thats
history
i
guess
you
wouldnt
understand
an
then
when
you
get
home
without
a
bath
or
a
hair
cut
or
the
movies
or
nothin

stickin
his
tongue

have
give
you
mable

em
no
more
i
aint
even
goin
to
menshun
all
the
money
ive
spent
on
you
for
movies
an
sodas
an
the
lord
knows
what
not
i
aint
the
kind
of
a
fello
to
throw
that
up
to
a
fello
or
even
menshun
it
in
no
ways
i
kept
track
of
it
though
in
a
little
book
it
comes
to
and
some
odd
sense
an
i
aint
agoin
to
hold
it
up
against
you
that
i
been
savin
in
the
bank
for
most
two
years
sos
to
have
a
little
somethin
towards
that
house
with
the
green
blinds
an
that
i
got
somethin
like
in
the
bank
if
you
can
believe
what
that
eagle
beak
in
the
cage
rites
in
your
book
all
wasted
you
might
say
when
you
think
of
the
fun
i
might
have
had
with
it
in
the
last
two
years
those
things
we
just
forget
you
seem
to
have
already
an
that
seasons
pass
i
got
for
you
for
the
happyhour
sos
you

otherwise
i
got
a
hunch

i
guess
this
will
hit
your
father
an
mother
pretty
hard
they
got
nobody
to
blame
but
yourself
on
the
other
hand
its
goin
to
please
some
girls
that
i
know
so
its
a
poor
wind
that
dont
blow
nobody
round

the
poets
say
i
guess
you
wont
here
much
about
the
poets
any
more
mable
about
all
youll
here
is
broggins

hate
a
man

home
defence

goin
to
have
a
military
weddin
mable
im
kind
of
sorry
for
your
father

his
liver
on
your
hands
dont
blame
me

the
doctor

of

shock

set
him
off
a
mile

time
it
