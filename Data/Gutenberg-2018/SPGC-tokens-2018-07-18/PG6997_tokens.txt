jefferson
worth
outfit
of
four
mules
and
a
big
wagon
pulled
out
of
san
felipe
at
daybreak
headed
for
rubio
city
from
the
swinging
red
tassels
on
the
bridles
of
the
leaders
to
the
galvanized
iron
water
bucket
dangling
from
the
tail
of
the
reach
back
of
the
rear
axle
the
outfit
wore
an
unmistakable
air
of
prosperity
the
wagon
was
loaded
only
with
a
the
few
necessary
camp
cooking
utensils
blankets
and
canvas
tarpaulin
with
rolled
barley
and
bales
of
hay
for
the
team
and
two
water
barrels
empty
hanging
by
its
canvas
strap
from
the
spring
of
the
driver
seat
was
a
large
canteen
behind
the
driver
there
was
another
seat
of
the
same
wide
comfortable
type
but
the
man
who
held
the
reins
was
apparently
alone
jefferson
worth
was
not
with
his
outfit
by
sending
the
heavy
wagon
on
ahead
and
following
later
with
a
faster
team
and
a
light
buckboard
worth
could
join
his
outfit
in
camp
that
night
saving
thus
at
least
another
half
day
for
business

san

jefferson

as
he
himself
would
have
put
it
figured
on
the
value
of

indeed
jefferson
worth
figured
on
the
value
of
nearly
everything
now
san
felipe
you
must
know
is
where
the
big
ships
come
in
and
the
air
tingles
with
the
electricity
of
commerce
as
men
from
all
lands
driven
by
the
master
passion
of
human
kind
good
business
seek
each
his
own
but
rubio
city
though
born
of
that
same
master
passion
of
the
race
is
where
the
thin
edge
of
civilization
is
thinnest
on
the
colorado
river
miles
beyond
the
coast
range
mountains
on
the
farther
side
of
that
dreadful
land
where
the
thirsty
atmosphere
is
charged
with
the
awful
silence
of
uncounted
ages
between
these
two
scenes
of
man
activity
so
different
and
yet
so
like
and
crossing
thus
the
land
of
my
story
there
was
only
a
rude
trail
two
hundred
and
more
hard
and
lonely
miles
of
it
the
only
mark
of
man
in
all
that
desolate
waste
and
itself
marked
every
mile
by
the
graves
of
men
and
by
the
bleached
bones
of
their
cattle
all
that
forenoon
on
every
side
of
the
outfit
the
beautiful
life
of
the
coast
country
throbbed
and
exulted
it
called
from
the
heaving
ocean
with
its
many
gleaming
sails
and
dark
drifting
steamer
smoke
under
the
wide
sky
it
sang
from
the
harbor
where
the
laden
ships
meet
the
long
trains
that
come
and
go
on
their
continental
errands
it
cried
loudly
from
the
busy
streets
of
village
and
town
and
laughed
out
from
field
and
orchard
but
always
the
road
led
toward
those
mountains
that
lifted
their
shoulders
and
ridges
across
the
way
as
though
in
dark
and
solemn
warning
to
any
who
should
dare
set
their
faces
toward
the
dreadful
land
of
want
and
death
that
lay
on
their
other
side
in
the
afternoon
every
mile
brought
scenes
more
lonely
until
in
the
foothills
that
creeping
bit
of
life
on
the
hard
old
trail
was
forgotten
by
the
busy
world
behind
even
as
it
seemed
to
forget
that
there
was
anywhere
any
life
other
than
its
creeping
self
as
the
sweating
mules
pulled
strongly
up
the
heavy
grades
the
man
on
the
high
seat
of
the
wagon
repaid
the
indifference
of
his
surroundings
with
a
like
indifference
unmoved
by
the
forbidding
grimness
of
the
mountains
unthoughtful
of
their
solemn
warning
he
took
his
place
as
much
a
part
of
the
lonely
scene
as
the
hills
themselves
slouching
easily
in
his
seat
he
gave
heed
only
to
his
team
and
to
the
road
ahead
when
he
spoke
to
the
mules
his
voice
was
a
soft
drawl
as
though
he
spoke
from
out
a
pleasing
reverie
and
though
his
words
were
often
hard
words
they
were
carried
to
the
animals
on
an
of
fellowship
and
understanding
the
long
whip
with
coiled
lash
was
in
its
socket
at
the
end
of
the
seat
the
stops
were
frequent
wise
in
the
wisdom
of
the
unfenced
country
and
knowing
the
land
ahead
this
driver
would
conserve
every
ounce
of
his
team
strength
against
a
possible
time
of
great
need
they
were
creeping
across
a
flank
of
the
hill
when
the
sprang
to
the
left
so
violently
that
nothing
but
the
instinctive
bracing
of
his
held
them
from
going
over
the
grade
the
same
instant
the
wheel
team
repeated
the
maneuver
but
not
so
quickly
as
the
slouching
figure
on
the
seat
sprang
into
action
a
quick
strong
pull
on
the
reins
a
sharp
yell
you
buck
molly
and
a
rattling
volley
of
strong
talk
swung
the
four
back
into
the
narrow
road
before
the
front
wheels
were
out
of
the
track
with
a
crash
the
heavy
brake
was
set
the
team
stopped
as
the
driver
half
rose
and
turned
to
look
back
he
slipped
the
reins
to
his
left
hand
and
his
right
dropped
to
his
hip
with
a
motion
too
quick
for
the
eye
to
follow
the
free
arm
straightened
and
the
mountain
echoed
wildly
to
the
loud
report
of
a
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
rear
of
the
wagon
a
rattlesnake
uncoiled
its
length
and
writhed
slowly
in
the
dust
before
the
echoes
of
the
shot
had
died
away
a
mad
inarticulate
roar
came
from
the
depths
of
the
wagon
box
the
roar
was
followed
by
a
thick
stream
of
oaths
in
an
unmistakably
irish
voice
the
driver
who
was
slipping
a
fresh
cartridge
into
the
cylinder
looked
up
to
see
a
man
grasping
the
back
of
the
rear
seat
for
support
while
rising
unsteadily
to
his
feet
the
irishman
as
he
stood
glaring
fiercely
at
the
man
who
had
so
rudely
awakened
him
was
without
hat
or
coat
and
with
bits
of
hay
clinging
to
a
soiled
shirt
that
was
unbuttoned
at
the
hairy
throat
presented
a
remarkable
figure
his
heavy
body
was
fitted
with
legs
like
posts
his
wide
shoulders
and
deep
chest
with
arms
to
match
his
legs
were
so
huge
as
to
appear
almost
grotesque
his
round
head
with
its
tumbled
thatch
of
sandy
hair
was
set
on
a
thick
while
all
over
the
big
bones
of
him
the
hard
muscles
lay
in
visible
knots
and
bunches
the
unsteady
poise
the
red
unshaven
sweating
face
and
the
angry
eyes
revealed
the
reason
for
his
sleep
under
such
uncomfortable
circumstances
the
silent
driver
gazed
at
his
fearsome
passenger
with
calm
eyes
that
seemed
to
hold
in
their
dark
depths
the
mystery
of
many
a
still
night
under
the
still
stars
in
a
voice
that
rumbled
up
from
his
hairy
chest
a
husky
menacing
growl
the
irishman
demanded
fwhat
the
hell
do
ye
mane
the
peace
wid
yer
clamor
for
less
than
a
sup
av
wather
i
go
over
to
ye
wid
me
two
hands
calmly
the
other
dropped
his
gun
into
its
holster
pointing
to
the
canteen
that
hung
over
the
side
of
the
wagon
fastened
by
its
canvas
strap
to
the
seat
spring
he
drawled
softly
there
the
water
help
yourself
stranger
the
gladiator
without
a
word
reached
for
the
canteen
and
with
huge
hairy
paws
lifted
it
to
his
lips
after
a
draught
of
prodigious
length
he
heaved
a
long
sigh
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
then
he
turned
his
fierce
eyes
again
on
the
driver
as
if
to
inquire
what
manner
of
person
he
might
be
who
had
so
unceremoniously
challenged
his
threat
the
irishman
saw
a
man
tall
and
spare
but
of
a
stringy
tough
and
supple
leanness
that
gave
him
the
look
of
being
fashioned
by
the
he
too
was
coatless
but
wore
a
vest
unbuttoned
over
a
loose
coarse
shirt
a
red
bandana
was
knotted
easily
about
his
throat
with
his
wide
hat
rough
trousers
tucked
in
long
boots
wrist
guards
and
the
loosely
buckled
cartridge
belt
with
its
long
his
very
dress
expressed
the
easy
freedom
of
the
wild
lands
while
the
dark
thin
face
accented
by
jet
black
hair
and
a
long
straight
mustache
had
the
look
of
the
wide
plains
with
a
grunt
that
might
have
expressed
either
approval
or
contempt
the
irishman
turned
and
groping
about
in
the
wagon
found
a
sorry
wreck
of
a
hat
again
he
stooped
and
this
time
from
between
the
bales
of
hay
lifted
a
coat
fit
companion
to
the
hat
carefully
he
felt
through
pocket
after
pocket
his
search
was
rewarded
by
a
clay
pipe
and
the
half
of
a
match
nothing
more
with
an
effort
he
explored
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
then
again
he
searched
the
coat
muttering
to
himself
broken
sentences
not
the
less
expressive
because
incomplete
where
the
divil
now
do
that
bate
well
i
be
with
a
temper
not
improved
by
his
loss
he
threw
down
the
garment
in
disgust
and
looked
up
angrily
the
silent
driver
was
holding
toward
him
a
sack
of
tobacco
the
irishman
with
another
grunt
crawled
under
the
empty
seat
and
climbing
heavily
over
the
back
of
the
seat
in
front
planted
himself
stolidly
by
the
driver
side
filling
his
pipe
with
care
and
deliberation
he
returned
the
sack
to
its
owner
and
struck
the
along
one
leg
shielding
the
tiny
flame
with
his
hands
before
applying
the
light
he
remarked
thoughtfully
ye
are
a
danged
reckless
fool
to
be
so
dishturbin
me
honest
slape
by
that
cannon
ye
carry
is
on
me
mind
to
discipline
ye
for
sich
outrageous
conduct
the
last
word
was
followed
by
loud
smacking
puffs
as
he
started
the
fire
in
the
under
his
nose
while
the
irishman
was
again
uttering
his
threat
the
driver
with
a
skillful
twist
rolled
a
cigarette
and
leaning
forward
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
deliberately
shared
the
with
his
blustering
companion
in
that
instant
the
blue
eyes
above
the
pipe
looked
straight
into
the
black
eyes
above
the
cigarette
and
a
faint
twinkle
of
approval
met
a
serious
glance
of
understanding
gathering
up
his
reins
and
sorting
them
carefully
the
driver
spoke
to
his
team
you
buck
molly
jack
pete
the
mules
heaved
ahead
again
the
silence
of
the
hills
was
shattered
by
the
rattling
rumble
of
the
wagon
and
the
ring
and
clatter
of
hoofs
stolidly
the
irishman
pulled
at
the
pipe
the
wagon
seat
sagging
heavily
with
his
weight
at
every
jolt
of
the
wheels
while
from
under
his
tattered
hat
rim
his
fierce
eyes
looked
out
upon
the
wild
landscape
with
occasional
side
glances
at
his
silent
indifferent
companion
again
the
team
was
halted
for
a
rest
on
the
heavy
grade
long
and
carefully
the
irishman
looked
about
him
and
then
turning
suddenly
upon
the
still
silent
driver
he
gazed
at
him
for
a
full
minute
before
saying
with
elaborate
mock
formality
it
may
be
sorr
that
bein
ye
are
sich
a
hell

at

drawling
answer
the
hot
blood
flamed
in
the
face
of
the
irishman
and
the
veins
in
his
thick
neck
stood
out
as
if
they
would
burst

turned
quickly
to
look
behind
him
for

driver
was
calmly
pointing
toward
the
end
of
the
seat
fwhat

he
demanded

the
man

the
big
man
lifted
the
canteen
and
drank
long
and
deep
when
he
had
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hairy
hand
and
had
returned
the
canteen
to
its
place
he
faced
his
companion
his
blue
eyes
twinkling
with
positive
approval
scratching
his

to
enjoy
the
blessin
advantages

afther
three
long
months
in

av

the

laughed
softly

the

looked
at
him
with
quickened
interest
ye
was
there
he
asked
some
was
the
laconic
reply
the
irishman
scratched
his
head
again
with
a
puzzled
air
i
disremimber
entire
was
there
some
throuble
maybe
the
other
grinned
things
was
movin
a
few
patrick
mooney
nodded
his
head
mostly
they
do
under
thim
circumstances
av
course
there
be
a
policeman
or
maybe
two
five
said
the
man
with
the
lines
gently
five
howly
mither
i
did
mesilf
proud
an
did
they
have
the
wagon
sure
they
wud
five
policemen
niver
walked
wan
av
thim
might
av
ut
was
but
five
niver
tell
me
man
who
else
was
at
the
party
no
howld
on
a
minut
he
interrupted
himself
thim
cops
stimulate
me
mimory
a
bit
was
there
not
a
bunch
av
from
wan
av
thim
big
ships
the
driver
nodded
the
other
pleased
with
the
success
of
his
mental
effort
continued
an
i
was
havin
a
peaceful
dhrink
wid
thim
all
whin
somewan
made
impedent
remarks
touchin
me
appearance
or
ancestors
i
disremimber
which
but
where
was
you
well
you
see
explained
the
driver
in
his
slow
way
hit
was
like
this
that
there
saloon
were
plumb
full
of
all
exceptin
you
an
me
i
was
a
heap
admirin
of
the
way
you
handled
that
big
hombre
what
opened
the
meetin
and
also
his
two
pardners
who
aimed
to
back
his
play
hit
was
sure
pretty
work
the
rest
of
the
crowd
sort
bunched
in
one
end
of
the
room
an
when
you
began
addressin
the
congregation
so
to
speak
on
the
habits
character
customs
and
breedin
of
in
general
an
the
present
company
in
particular
i
see
right
there
that
you
was
off
more
you
could
chaw
it
was
no
way
reasonable
that
any
human
could
handle
that
whole
outfit
with
only
just
his
bare
hands
so
i
edged
over
your
way
plumb
edified
by
your
remarks
and
when
the
rush
for
the
bench
come
i
unlimbered
an
headed
the
stampede
pronto
then
i
made
my
little
proposition
i
told
that
bein
the
only
individual
on
the
premises
not
a
nor
an
irishman
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
referee
the
obsequies
so
to
speak
and
that
odds
of
twenty
to
one
not
to
mention
knives
was
strictly
agin
my
convictions
moreover
bein
the
sole
an
only
uninterested
audience
i
had
rights
then
i
offers
to
bet
my
pile
even
money
that
you
could
handle
the
whole
bunch
takin
two
at
a
throw
i
knowed
it
were
some
odds
but
i
noticed
that
them
three
what
opened
the
meetin
was
still
under
the
influence
also
i
undertook
to
see
that
specifications
was
faithfully
fulfilled
mither
av
gawd
fwhat
a
sociable
broke
in
the
irishman
an
me
too

then
the
police
called

and
the
bets
were
off
they
pinched
the
house
they
took
you

hittin
me
with
a
club
from

i
woke
up
in
a

pipeful
an
tell

that
av
ye
can
the
driver
passed
over
the
tobacco
sack
and
stopping
his
team
for
another
rest
rolled
a
cigarette
for
himself
that
easy
he
said
this
here
is
jefferson
worth
outfit
he
wanted
me
to
start
home
this
morning
so
he
got
me
off
i
do

mostly
nobody

how
jefferson
worth
does
things
there
was
a
man
with
him
who
knowed
you
and
as
i
was
some
disinclined
to
leave

under
the
circumstances

plumb
admired

sizin

whether

felipe
or
i
takes
her
on

the
irishman
spat
emphatically
over
the
wheel
an
is
a
gintleman
wid
proper
instincts
ye
are
though
as
a
rule
i
howld
ut
impolite
to
carry
a
gun
but
afther
all
is
a
matter
av
opinion
an
i
free
to
admit
that
there
are
occasions
anyhow
ye
handle
ut
wid
grace
intilligence
an
fists
er
shticks
er
knives
er
guns
that
the
thing
that
marks
the

is
not
patrick
mooney
that
fault
a
gintleman
for
ways
that
he
ca
help

to
his
improper
up
av
ye

so
indelicate
as
to

good
bhoy

this
who

this
man
that
says
he
knows
me
texas
joe
shook
his
head
and
picking
out
his
lines
called
to
his
team
when
they
were
under
way
again
he
said
i
did
hear
his
name
but
i
judge
from
the
talk
that
he
is
one
o
them
there
civil
engineers
an
that
he
headin
for
rubio
city
to
build
the
railroad
that
through
to
the
coast
worth
told
me
that
there
would
be
another
man
and
a
kid
to
go
back
with
us
but
i
know
that
worth
had
never
seen
them
before
himself
pat
shifted
his
heavy
bulk
to
face
the
driver
and
removing
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
asked
with
deliberation
an
do
ye
mane
to
tell
me
that
this
place
we
goin
to
is
on
the
new
line
av
the
southwestern
an
continental
sure
they
buildin
into
rubio
city
from
the
east
now
the
irishman
became
excited
an
this
man
that
knows
me
this
engineer
is
he
a
fine
big
man
wid
brown
eyes
an
the
look
av
a
king
i
ai
never
seen
no
kings
drawled
tex
but
the
rest
of
it
sure
fits
him
well
fwhat
do
ye
think
av
that
is
the
seer
himsilf
or
i
not
the
son
av
me
own
mither
i
was
hearin
in
frisco
where
i
went
the
last
time
i
drawed
me
pay
that
he
was
like
to
be
on
the
an
extension
was
that
that
took
me
to
san
felipe
bein
wishful
to
get
a
job
wid
him
again
well
well
an
to
think
ut
the
seer
himsilf
what
that
you
call
him
the
seer
i
disremimber
his
other
name
but
he
got
wan
all
shtraight
an
proper
he
that
kind
they
call
him
the
seer
because
av
his
talk
av
the
great
things
that
will
be
doin
in
this
country
av
no
rain
at
all
whin
ignorant
savages
like
yersilf
learn
how
to
use
the
wather
that
in
the
rivers
for
irrigation
i
heard
him
say
mesilf
that
hundreds
av
thousands
av
acres
av
these
big
deserts
will
be
turned
into
farms
an
all
that
be
what
he
calls
was
for
that
some
danged
surveyor
give
him
the
name
an
ut
shtuck
but
most
av
the
engineers
the
rale
engineers
do
ye
mind
is
wid
him
though
they
do
be
jokin
him
the
divil
av
a
lot
about
what
they
calls
his
visions
he
did
like
he
was
locoed
said
texas
joe
thoughtfully
but
he
sure
some
off
on
that
there
desert
proposition
as
you
see
before
we
lands
in
rubio
i
dunno
i
seen
some
quare
things
in
me
time
in
the
way
av
big
jobs
that
nobody
thought
could
be
done
at
all
but
lave
ut
go
is
not
the
likes
av
me
an
you
that
qualified
to
give
judgment
on
sich
janiuses
as
the
seer
who
i
heard
tell
has
the
right
to
put
more
letters
afther
his
name
than
ye
have
teeth
in
yer
head
all
the
same
it
ai
the
brand
on
a
horse
that
makes
him
travel
a
man
sure
need
somethin
more
hefty
than
letters
after
his
name
when
he
goes
up
against
the
desert
well
lave
ut
go
at
that
wait
ye
know
him
but
fwhat
this
yer
tellin
me
about
a
kid
the
seer
has
no
family
at
all
but
himsilf
his
job
texas

maybe
not
pard
but
he
sure
got
together
part
of
a
family
this
trip
is
ut
a
gurl
or
a
bhoy
boy
a
i
say
the
irishman
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
dunno
is
a
quare
thing
for
the
seer
av
it
was
me
or
you
now
but
the
seer
it
danged
quare
but
tell
me
fwhat
this

a
good
healthy
pull
he
must
have
to
be
separatin
us
from
thim
san
felipe
police
texas
joe
deliberated
so
long
before
answering
this
that
pat
glanced
at
him
uneasily
several
times
at
last
the
driver
drawled
you
right
there
jefferson
worth
sure
has
some
pull
pat
grunted
but
fwhat
does
he
do
do
tex
swung
his
team
around
a
spur
of
the
mountain
where
the
trail
leads
along
the
side
of
a
canyon
to
its
head
far
below
they
heard
the
tumbling
roar
of
a
stream
in
its
rocky
course
sure
the
man
must
do
something
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
jefferson
worth
does
everybody
oh
ho
so
that
ut
i
no
care
for
the
cards
mesilf
but
av
a
a
professional
an
you
off
there
pardner
jefferson
worth
ai
that
kind
he
one
o
these
here
financierin
sports
an
so
far
as
anybody
that
i
ever
seen
goes
he
got
a
dead
cinch
ye
mane
he
a
banker
sure
the
pioneer
in
rubio
city
he
started
the
game
in
the
early
days
an
he
been
it
up
ever
since
hit
plumb
curious
about
this
here
financierin
business
continued
tex
in
his
slow
meditative
way
looks
to
me
mostly
jest
plain
common
only
they
do
it
with
money
of
a
gun
in
the
old
days
you
used
to
get
the
drop
on
your
man
with
your
six
all
regular
an
take
what
he
happened
to
have
in
his

then
the
posse
get
after
you
mebbe
string
you
up
which
was
all
right
bein

of
the
game

fair
makes
my
back
hair
raise
the
common
run
o
people
ai
got
no
more
show
stackin
up
agin
jefferson
worth
than
worth
o
ice
has
in
hell
accordin
to
my
notion
hit
this
here
same
financierin
game
that

west

cattle
range
is
about
all
gone
now
if
they
keeps
it

engineer
mind
ye
fwhat
could
the

do
widout
the
men
wid

the
irishman
words
were
answered
by
a
cheerful
whoa
and
a
crash
of
the
brakes
as
texas
joe
brought
his
team
to
a
stand
near
the
spring
at
the
head
of
the
canyon
we
camp
here
he
announced
this
is
the
last
water
we
strike
until
we
make
it
over
the
pass
to
mountain
springs
on
the
desert
side
jefferson
worth
will
be
along
with
the
seer
and
his
kid
most
any
time
now
a
little
before
dusk
the
banker
with
his
two
companions
arrived
hello
pat
the
man
who
leaped
from
the
buckboard
and
strode
toward
the
waiting
irishman
was
tall
and
broad
with
the
head
and
chin
of
a
soldier
and
the
brown
eyes
of
a
dreamer
he
was
dressed
in
rough
corduroys
blue
flannel
shirt
laced
boots
and
stetson
and
he
greeted
the
burly
irishman
as
a
a
joyful
grin
spread
over
the
battered
features
of
the
gladiator
as
he
grasped
the
seer
outstretched
hand
well
dang
me
but
ut
glad
i
am
to
see
ye
sorr
in
this
divil
own
land
i
had
me
natural
doubts

whin
i
woke
up
in
the
wagon
but
ut
all
right
is
proud
i
am
to
be
abducted
by

the
engineer
laugh
awoke
the
echoes
in
the
canyon
it
was
a
rescue
man
well

let
ut
go
at
that
but
tell

lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
rumble
fwhat

that
ye
have
yer
bhoy
wid
ye
sure
i
niver
knew
that
ye
was
a
man

he
looked
toward
the
slender
lad
who
with
the
readiness
of
a
grown
man
was
helping
the
driver
of
the
buckboard
to
unhitch
his
team
of
four
broncos
is
a
good
lad
he
is
or
i
a
dutchman
you
right
pat
abe
is
a
good
boy
the
seer
answered
gravely
i
picked
him
up
in
a
mining
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
mojave
desert
when
i
was
running
a
line
of
preliminary
surveys
through
that
country
for
the
and
last
year
he
was
born
in
the
camp
and
his
mother
died
when
he
was
a
baby

how
he
pulled
through

what
those
mining
places
are

killed
in
a
drunken
row
while
i
was
there
and
abe
showed
so
much
cool
nerve
and
downright
manliness
that
i
offered
him
a
place
with
my
party
he
has
been
with
me
ever
since
pat
voice
was
husky
as
he
said
i
ax
yer
pardon
sorr
for
me
blunderin
impedence
about
yer
bein
a
man
av
family
i
a
danged
old
wid
no
education
but
me
two
fists
an
no
manners
at
all
the
engineer
reply
was
prevented
by
the
approach
of
jefferson
worth
who
had
been
talking
with
texas
joe
the
banker
head
came
but
little
above
the
seer
shoulders
and
in
comparison
with
the
irishman
heavy
bulk
he
appeared
almost
insignificant
while
his
plain
business
suit
of
gray
seemed
altogether
out
of
place
in
the
wild
surroundings
his
face
was
an
expressionless
gray
mask
and
his
gray
eyes
turned
from
the
irishman
to
the
engineer
without
a
hint
of
emotion
the
two
men
felt
that
somewhere
behind
that
gray
mask
they
were
being
carefully
estimated
measured
valued
as
possible
factors
in
some
plan
he
spoke
to
the
seer
and
his
voice
was
without
a
suggestion
of
color
i
see
that
your
friend
has
recovered
it
was
as
though
he
stated
a
fact
that
he
had
just
verified
laughing
at
the
memory
of
the
irishman
san
felipe
experience
the
engineer
said
worth
permit
me
to
introduce
patrick
mooney
whom
i
have
known
for
years
as
the
best
boss
of
a
grading
gang
in
the
west
pat
this
is
jefferson
worth
president
of
the
pioneer
bank
in
rubio
city
the
irishman
clutched
at
his
tattered
in
embarrassed
acknowledgment
of
the
seer
formality
jefferson
worth
from
behind
his
gray
mask
said
in
his
exact
colorless
voice
he
looks
as
though
he
ought
to
handle
men
as
the
banker
passed
on
toward
the
big
wagon
the
irishman
drew
close
to
the
seer
and
whispered
hoarsely
now
fwhat
the
hell
kind
av
a
man
is
that
is
the
truth
sorr
that
whin
he
looked
at
me
out
av
that
face
i
could
bare
kape
from

chapter

jefferson
worth
offering
when
day
broke
over
the
topmost
ridges
of
no
man
mountains
jefferson
worth
outfit
was
ready
to
move
the
driver
of
the
lighter
rig
with
its
four
broncos
set
out
for
san
felipe
on
the
front
seat
of
the
big
wagon
texas
joe
picked
up
his
reins
sorted
them
carefully
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
his
employer
all
set
go
ahead
you
buck
molly
the
lead
mules
straightened
their
traces
jack
pete
as
the
brake
was
released
with
a
clash
and
rattle
of
iron
rods
the
wheelers
threw
their
weight
into
their
collars
and
the
wagon
moved
ahead
grim
tireless
sentinels
no
man
mountains
stood
guard
between
the
fertile
land
on
their
seaward
side
and
the
desolate
forgotten
wastes
of
the
east
they
said
to
the
country
of
green
life
of
progress
and
growth
and
civilization
that
marched
to
their
line
on
the
west
halt
and
it
stopped
to
the
land
of
lean
want
of
gray
death
of
gaunt
hunger
and
torturing
thirst
that
crept
to
their
feet
on
the
other
side
stop
and
it
came
no
farther
with
no
land
to
till
no
mineral
to
dig
their
very
poverty
was
their
protection
with
an
air
of
grim
finality
they
declared
strongly
that
as
they
had
always
been
they
would
always
remain
and
at
the
beginning
of
my
story
save
for
that
one
slender
trail
their
hoary
boast
had
remained
unchallenged
steadily
but
with
frequent
rests
on
the
grades
jefferson
outfit
climbed
toward
the
summit
and
a
little
before
noon
gained
the
pass
the
loud
rattling
rumble
of
the
wagon
as
the
tires
bumped
and
ground
over
the
stony
way
with
the
sharp
ring
and
clatter
of
the
hoofs
of
the
team
echoed
echoed
and
echoed
again
loudly
wildly
the
rude
sounds
assaulted
the
stillness
until
the
quiet
seemed
hopelessly
shattered
by
the
din
softly
tamely
the
sounds
drifted
away
in
the
clear
distance
through
groves
of
live
oak
thickets
of
greasewood
juniper
manzanita
and
sage
into
canyon
and
wash
from
bluff
and
ledge
along
slope
and
spur
and
shoulder
over
ridge
and
saddle
and
peak
fainting
dying
the
impotent
sounds
of
man
passing
sank
into
the
stillness
and
were
lost
when
the
team
halted
for
a
brief
rest
it
was
in
a
moment
as
if
the
silence
had
never
been
broken
grim
awful
the
hills
gave
no
signs
of
man
presence
gave
that
creeping
bit
of
life
no
heed
at
mountain
spring
a
lonely
little
pool
on
the
desert
side
of
the
huge
wall
they
stopped
for
dinner
when
the
meal
was
over
texas
joe
with
the
assistance
of
pat
filled
the
water
barrels
while
the
boy
busied
himself
with
the
canteen
and
the
seer
and
jefferson
worth
looked
on
is
a
dhry
counthry
ahead
i
thinking
remarked
the
irishman
inquiringly
as
he
lifted
another
dripping
bucket
some
returned
tex
there
are
three
water
holes
between
here
and
the
river
where
there
water
sometimes
mostly
though
when
you
need
it
worst
there
ai
none
there
an
i
reckon
a
dry
water
hole
is
about
the
most
discouragin
proposition
there
is
they
all
be
dry
this
trip
there
was
nothin
but
mud
at
wolf
wells
when
we
come
through
last
week
again
the
barren
rocks
and
the
grim
forbidding
hills
echoed
the
loud
sound
of
wheel
and
hoof
down
the
steep
flank
of
the
mountain
with
screaming
grinding
brakes
they
thundered
and
clattered
into
the
narrow
of
devil
canyon
with
its
sheer
walls
and
shadowy
gloom
the
little
stream
that
trickled
down
from
the
tiny
spot
of
green
at
the
spring
tried
bravely
to
follow
but
soon
sank
exhausted
into
the
dry
waste
a
cool
wind
like
a
draft
through
a
tunnel
was
in
their
faces
after
perhaps
two
hours
of
this
the
way
widened
out
the
sides
of
the
canyon
grew
lower
with
now
and
then
gaps
and
breaks
then
the
walls
gave
way
to
low
rounded
hills
through
which
the
winding
trail
lay
a
bed
of
sand
and
gravel
and
here
and
there
appeared
clumps
of
greasewood
and
cacti
of
several
varieties
at
length
they
passed
out
from
between
the
last
of
the
and
suddenly
as
though
a
mighty
curtain
were
lifted
they
faced
the
desert
at
their
feet
the
mesa
lay
in
a
blaze
of
white
sunlight
and
beyond
and
below
the
edge
of
the
bench
the
vast
king
basin
country
at
the
edge
of
the
mesa
texas
halted
his
team
and
the
little
party
looked
out
and
away
over
those
awful
reaches
of
desolate
solitude
the
seer
and
pat
uttered
involuntary
exclamations
jefferson
worth
texas
and
abe
were
silent
but
the
boy
thin
features
were
aglow
with
eager
enthusiasm
and
the
face
of
the
driver
revealed
an
interest
in
the
scene
that
years
of
familiarity
could
not
entirely
deaden
but
the
gray
mask
of
the
banker
betrayed
no
emotion
in
that
view
of
such
magnitude
that
miles
meant
nothing
there
was
not
a
sign
of
man
save
the
one
slender
thread
of
road
that
was
so
soon
lost
in
the
distance
from
horizon
to
horizon
so
far
that
the
eye
ached
in
the
effort
to
comprehend
it
there
was
no
cloud
to
cast
a
shadow
and
the
deep
sky
poured
its
resistless
flood
of
light
upon
the
vast
dun
plain
with
savage
fury
as
if
to
beat
into
helplessness
any
living
creature
that
might
chance
to
be
caught
thereon
and
the
desert
receiving
that
flood
from
the
wide
hot
sky
mysteriously
wove
with
it
soft
scarfs
of
lilac
misty
veils
of
purple
and
filmy
curtains
of
rose
and
pearl
and
gold
strangely
formed
with
it
wide
lakes
of
blue
rimmed
with
phantom
hills
of
red
and
violet
constantly
changing
shifting
scene
on
scene
as
dream
pictures
shift
and
change
only
the
strange
silent
life
that
through
long
years
the
desert
had
taught
to
endure
its
hardships
was
there
the
lizard
lean
gaunt
coyote
and
their
kind
only
the
hard
growth
that
the
ages
had
evolved
dotted
the
floor
of
the
basin
in
the
near
distance
the
and
greasewood
with
here
and
there
clumps
of
mesquite
and
over
it
all
over
the
strange
hard
life
the
weird
constantly
shifting
scenes
the
wondrous
colors
was
the
dominant
insistent
compelling
spirit
of
the
land
a
brooding
dreadful
silence
a
waiting
waiting
waiting
a
mystic
call
that
was
at
once
a
threat
and
a
promise
a
still
drawing
of
the
line
across
which
no
man
might
go
and
live
save
those
master
men
who
should
win
the
right
after
a
while
the
engineer
pointing
said
the
line
of
the
southwestern
and
continental
must
follow
the
base
of
those
hills
away
over
there
is
that
right
texas
that
be
about
it
the
driver
answered
i
hear
you
through
san
antonio
pass
an
that
to
the
north
rubio
city
lies
about
here
he
pointed
a
little
south
of
east
our
road
runs
through
them
sand
hills
that
you
can
see
shinin
like
gold
over
there
dry
river
crossin
is
jest
beyond
you
can
see
lone
mountain
off
here
to
the
south
hit
sure
be
some
warm
down
there
look
at
them
dancin
an
over
there
where
you
see
that
yellow
mist
like
is
a
big
sand
storm
we
ai
likely
to
get
a
long
one
this
time
o
the
year
but
you
ca
tell
what
this
old
desert
do
she
sure
some
uncertain
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
the
injuns
call
it
and
i
always
thought
that
all
things
considerin
the
name
fits
mighty
close
you
can
see
hit
jest
a
great
big
basin
the
hollow
of
god
hand
repeated
the
seer
in
a
low
tone
he
lifted
his
hat
with
an
unconscious
gesture
of
reverence
the
irishman
as
the
engineer
translated
crossed
himself
howly
mither
fwhat
a
name
jefferson
worth
spoke
drive
on
texas
and
so
with
the
yellow
dancing
along
their
road
and
that
yellow
cloud
in
the
distance
they
moved
down
the
slope
down
into
the
king
basin
into
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
the
hollow
of
hand
is
that
true
sir
asked
abe
of
the
seer
is
what
true
son
what
texas
said
about
the
ocean
yes
it
true
the
lowest
point
of
this
basin
is
nearly
three
hundred
feet
below
sea
level
the
railroad
we
are
going
to
build
follows
right
around
the
rim
on
the
other
side
over
there
this
slope
that
we
are
going
down
now
is
the
ancient
beach
then
while
they
pushed
on
into
the
silence
and
the
heat
of
that
dreadful
land
the
engineer
told
the
boy
and
his
companions
how
the
ages
had
wrought
with
river
and
wave
and
sun
and
wind
to
make
the
king
basin
desert
wolf
wells
they
found
dry
as
texas
had
anticipated
phantom
lake
also
was
dry
occasionally
they
crossed
dry
ancient
water
courses
made
by
the
river
when
the
land
was
being
formed
sometimes
there
were
glassy
hard
bare
alkali
flats
again
the
trail
led
through
patches
of
desert
growth
or
twisted
and
wound
between
high
hummocks
always
there
was
the
wide
hot
sky
the
glaring
flood
of
light
unbroken
by
shadow
masses
to
relieve
the
eye
and
reflected
hotly
from
the
sandy
floor
of
the
old
that
evening
when
they
made
camp
a
heavy
mass
of
clouds
hung
over
the
top
of
no
man
mountains
and
the
long
coast
range
that
walled
in
the
basin
texas
joe
watching
these
clouds
said
nothing
but
when
pat
threw
on
the
ground
the
water
left
in
his
cup
after
drinking
the
plainsman
opened
upon
him
with
language
that
startled
them
all
the
next
day
noon
found
them
in
the
first
of
the
sand
hills
there
was
no
sign
of
vegetation
here
for
the
huge
mounds
and
ridges
of
white
sand
piled
like
drifts
of
snow
were
never
quite
still
always
they
move
eastward
before
the
prevailing
winds
from
the
west
through
the
greater
part
of
the
year
they
advance
very
slowly
but
when
the
fierce
gales
sweep
down
from
the
mountains
they
roll
forward
so
swiftly
that
any
object
in
their
path
is
quickly
buried
in
their
smothering
depths
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
texas
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
huge
drift
to
look
over
the
land
the
others
saw
him
stand
a
moment
against
the
sky
gazing
to
the
northwest
then
he
turned
and
slid
down
the
steep
side
of
the
mound
to
the
waiting
wagon
she
comin
he
remarked
laconically
an
she
a
big
one
i
reckon
we
may
as
well
get
as
far
as
we
can
a
few
minutes
later
they
saw
the
sky
behind
them
filling
as
with
a
golden
mist
the
atmosphere
dry
and
hot
seemed
charged
with
mysterious
terrible
power
the
very
mules
tossed
their
heads
uneasily
and
tugged
at
the
reins
as
if
they
felt
themselves
pursued
by
some
fearful
thing
straight
and
hard
with
terrific
velocity
the
wind
was
coming
down
through
the
mountain
passes
and
sweeping
across
the
wide
miles
of
desert
gathering
the
sand
as
it
came
swiftly
the
golden
mist
extended
over
their
heads
a
thick
yellow
fog
through
which
the
sun
shone
dully
with
a
weird
unnatural
light
then
the
stinging
blinding
choking
blast
was
upon
them
with
pitiless
savage
fury
in
a
moment
all
signs
of
the
trail
were
obliterated
over
the
high
edges
of
the
drift
the
sand
curled
and
streamed
like
blizzard
snow
about
the
outfit
it
whirled
and
eddied
cutting
the
faces
of
the
men
and
forcing
them
with
closed
eyes
to
gasp
for
breath
of
their
own
accord
the
mules
stopped
and
texas
shouted
to
worth
it
ai
no
use
for
us
to
try
to
go
on
sir
there
ai
no
trail
now
and
we
jest
drift
around
as
far
from
the
lee
of
a
drift
as
possible
all
hands
under
the
desert
man
direction
worked
to
rig
a
tarpaulin
on
the
windward
side
of
the
wagon
then
with
the
mules
unhitched
and
securely
tied
to
the
vehicle
the
men
crouched
under
their
rude
shelter
the
irishman
was
choking
coughing
sputtering
and
cursing
the
engineer
laughed
at
their
predicament
and
abe
lee
grinned
in
sympathy
while
texas
joe
accepted
the
situation
grimly
with
the
forbearance
of
long
experience
but
jefferson
worth
face
was
the
same
expressionless
gray
mask
he
gave
no
hint
of
impatience
at
the
delay
no
uneasiness
at
the
situation
no
annoyance
at
the
discomfort
it
was
as
though
he
had
foreseen
the
situation
and
had
prepared
himself
to
meet
it
how
long
do
you
figure
this
will
last
tex
he
asked
in
his
colorless
voice
not
more
than
three
days
returned
the
driver
it
may
be
over
in
three
hours
the
morning
of
the
second
day
they
crawled
from
their
blankets
beneath
the
wagon
to
find
the
sky
clear
and
the
air
free
from
dust
eagerly
they
prepared
to
move
against
their
shelter
the
sand
had
drifted
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
wheels
and
the
itself
was
more
than
half
filled
the
hair
beard
and
clothing
of
the
men
were
thickly
coated
with
powdery
dust
while
every
sign
of
the
trail
was
gone
and
the
wheels
sank
heavily
into
the
soft
sand
three
times
texas
halted
the
laboring
team
and
climbing
to
the
summit
of
a
drift
determined
his
course
by
marks
unknown
to
those
who
waited
below
again
they
stopped
for
the
plainsman
to
take
an
observation
and
this
time
the
four
in
the
wagon
watching
the
figure
of
the
driver
against
the
sky
saw
him
turn
abruptly
and
come
down
to
them
with
long
plunging
strides
instinctively
they
knew
that
something
unusual
had
come
under
his
eye
the
seer
and
jefferson
worth
spoke
together
what
is
it
tex
a
stray
horse
about
a
mile
ahead
for
the
first
time
texas
joe
uncoiled
the
long
lash
of
his
whip
and
his
call
you
buck
molly
was
punctuated
by
cracks
that
sounded
strangely
in
the
silence
of
the
sandy
waste
as
they
came
within
sight
of
the
strange
horse
the
poor
beast
staggered
wearily
to
meet
the
wagon
the
broken
strap
of
his
halter
swinging
loosely
from
his
head
look
at
the
poor
baste
said
pat
is
near
dead
he
is
wid
thirst
he
leaped
to
the
ground
and
started
toward
the
water
barrel
in
the
rear
of
the
wagon
hold
on
pat
said
the
colorless
voice
of
jefferson
worth
and
his
words
were
followed
by
the
report
of
texas
joe
the
irishman
turned
to
see
the
strange
horse
lying
dead
on
the
sand
fwhat
the
hell
he
demanded
hotly
but
texas
was
eyeing
him
coolly
and
something
checked
the
anger
of
the
irishman
you
do
seem
to
sabe
drawled
the
man
of
the
desert
replacing
the
empty
shell
in
his
gun
there
ai
hardly
enough
water
to
carry
us
through
now
an
we
may
have
to
pick
up
this
other
outfit
no
one
spoke
as
pat
climbed
heavily
back
to
his
seat
for
two
miles
the
tracks
of
the
strange
horse
were
visible
then
they
were
blotted
out
by
the
sand
that
had
filled
them
he
made
that
much
since
the
blow
was
texas
slow
comment
how
far
we
are
from
where
he
started
is
all
guess
as
they
pushed
on
all
eyes
searched
the
country
eagerly
and
before
long
they
found
the
spot
for
which
they
looked
a
light
spring
wagon
with
a
piece
of
a
halter
strap
tied
to
one
of
the
wheels
was
more
than
by
the
sand
in
the
lee
of
a
high
drift
there
was
a
small
water
keg
empty
with
its
seams
already
beginning
to
open
in
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
a
some
bedding
and
part
of
a
bale
of
more
jefferson
worth
pat
and
the
boy
attempted
to
dig
in
the
steep
side
of
the
drift
that
rose
above
the
outfit
but
at
their
every
movement
tons
of
the
dry
sand
came
sliding
down
upon
them
it
ai
no
use
worth
said
texas
as
the
banker
straightened
up
baffled
in
his
effort
you
will
never
know
what
buried
in
there
until
god
almighty
uncovers
it
then
the
man
of
the
desert
and
plains
read
the
story
of
the
tragedy
as
though
he
had
been
an
eye
witness
they
was
travelin
light
counted
on
makin
good
time
they
must
have
counted
too
on
water
in
the
hole
he
kicked
the
empty
keg
their
supply
give
out
then
that
caught
and
the
horses
broke
loose
of
course
they
would
go
to
hunt
their
stock
not
darin
to
be
left
afoot
and
without
water
an
hits
a
thousand
to
one
they
never
got
back
to
the
outfit
we
takin
too
many
chances
ourselves
to
lose
much
time
and
i
do
reckon
there
any
use
but
we
better
look
around
maybe
he
directed
the
little
party
to
scatter
and
to
keep
on
the
high
ground
so
that
they
would
not
lose
sight
of
each
other
until
well
on
in
the
afternoon
they
searched
the
vicinity
but
with
no
reward
while
the
hot
sun
the
dry
burning
waste
and
the
glaring
sands
of
the
desert
warned
them
that
every
hour
delay
might
mean
their
own
death
when
they
returned
at
last
to
the
wagon
called
in
by
texas
no
one
spoke
as
they
went
on
their
way
each
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
of
the
grim
evidence
of
the
desert
power
another
hour
passed
suddenly
texas
halted
the
mules
and
with
an
exclamation
leaped
to
the
ground
the
others
saw
that
he
was
bending
over
a
dim
track
in
the
sand
my
god
men
he
shouted
hit
a
woman
for
a
short
way
he
followed
the
then
running
back
to
the
wagon
and
springing
to
his
seat
swung
his
long
whip
and
urged
the
team
ahead
hit
a
woman
he
repeated
when
the
others
went
away
and
come
back
she
started
ahead
in
the
storm
alone
she
had
got
this
far
when
the
blow
quit
leavin
her
tracks
to
show
we
may
he
urged
his
mules
to
greater
effort
the
prints
of
the
woman
shoe
could
be
plainly
seen
now
look
said
tex
pointing
she
staggerin
now
she
stopped
whoa
throwing
his
weight
on
the
lines
he
leaned
over
from
his
seat
look
men
look
there
he
cried
as
he
pointed
she
carryin
a
kid
see
where
she
set
it
down
for
a
rest
it
was
all
too
clear
beside
the
woman
track
were
the
prints
of
two
baby
shoes
the
seer
with
a
long
breath
drew
his
hand
across
his
face
hurry
tex
for
god
sake
hurry
the
irishman
was
cursing
fiercely
in
impotent
rage
clenching
and
unclenching
his
huge
hairy
fists
the
boy
cowered
in
his
seat
but
not
a
change
came
over
the
features
of
jefferson
worth
only
the
delicate
pointed
fingers
of
his
nervous
hands
caressed
constantly
his
unshaven
chin
fingered
his
clothing
or
gripped
the
edge
of
the
wagon
seat
as
he
leaned
forward
in
his
place
texas
grim
cool
alert
his
lean
figure
instinct
now
with
action
and
his
dark
eyes
alight
swung
his
long
whip
and
handled
his
reins
with
a
master
skill
calling
upon
every
atom
of
his
team
strength
while
reading
those
tracks
in
the
sand
as
one
would
scan
a
printed
page
it
was
all
written
there
that
story
of
mother
love
where
she
staggered
with
fatigue
where
she
was
forced
to
rest
where
the
baby
walked
a
little
way
and
once
or
twice
where
the
little
one
stumbled
and
fell
as
the
sand
proved
too
heavy
for
the
little
feet
and
all
the
while
the
desert
dragging
with
dead
weight
at
the
wheels
seemed
to
fight
against
them
it
was
as
though
the
dreadful
land
knew
that
only
time
was
needed
to
complete
its
work
then
the
hot
sun
dropped
beyond
the
purple
wall
of
mountain
and
the
mystery
of
the
long
twilight
began
dry
river
crossing
is
just
ahead
said
tex
and
soon
the
outfit
pitched
down
the
steep
bank
of
a
deep
wash
that
had
been
made
in
some
forgotten
age
by
an
overflow
of
the
great
river
occasionally
after
the
infrequent
rains
of
winter
some
water
was
to
be
found
here
in
a
hole
under
the
high
bank
a
short
way
from
the
trail
with
a
crash
of
brakes
the
team
stopped
at
the
bottom
the
men
springing
from
the
wagon
and
leaving
the
panting
mules
to
stand
with
drooping
heads
started
to
search
the
wash
but
in
a
moment
texas
shouted
and
the
others
quickly
joined
him
near
the
dry
water
hole
lay
the
body
of
a
woman
by
her
side
was
a
small
canteen
illustration
he
had
lifted
the
canteen
and
was
holding
it
upside
down
the
engineer
bent
to
examine
the
still
form
for
some
sign
of
life
it
ai
no
use
sir
said
texas
she
gone
he
had
lifted
the
canteen
and
was
holding
it
upside
down
with
his
finger
he
touched
the
mouth
of
the
vessel
and
held
out
his
hand
the
finger
was
wet
you
see
he
said
when
her
did
come
back
she
started
with
the
kid
an
what
water
she
had
but
she
would
drink
none
herself
an
the
hard
trip
in
the
heat
and
sand
carryin
the
baby
an
the
water
hole
dry
was
too
much
for
her
if
only
we
had
known
an
come
on
instead
of
huntin
back
there
where
it
was
no
use
we
in
time
as
the
little
party
speechless
at
the
words
of
texas
stood
in
the
twilight
looking
down
upon
the
lifeless
form
a
chorus
of
wild
snarling
barking
yowls
with
shrill
howls
broke
on
the
still
air
it
was
the
coyotes
evening
call
to
the
silent
men
the
weird
sound
seemed
the
triumphant
cry
of
the
desert
itself
and
they
started
in
horror
then
from
the
dusky
shadow
of
the
high
bank
farther
up
the
wash
came
another
cry
that
broke
the
spell
that
was
upon
them
and
drew
an
answering
shout
from
their
lips
as
they
ran
forward
mamma
mamma
barba
wants
drink
please
bring
drink
mamma
jefferson
worth
reached
her
first
close
under
the
bank
where
she
had
wandered
after
mamma
lay
down
to
sleep
and
evidently
just
awakened
from
a
tired
nap
by
the
coyotes
cry
sat
a
little
girl
of
not
more
than
four
years
her
brown
hair
was
all
tumbled
and
tossed
and
her
big
brown
eyes
were
wide
with
wondering
fear
at
the
four
strange
men
and
the
boy
who
stood
over
her
mamma
mamma
she
whimpered
barba
wants
mamma
jefferson
worth
knelt
before
her
holding
out
his
hands
and
his
voice
as
he
spoke
to
the
baby
made
his
companions
look
at
him
in
wonder
it
was
so
full
of
tenderness
the
little
girl
fixed
her
big
eyes
questioningly
upon
the
kneeling
man
the
others
waited
breathless
then
suddenly
as
if
at
something
she
saw
in
the
gray
face
of
the
financier
the
little
one
drew
back
with
fear
upon
her
baby
features
and
in
her
baby
voice
go
go
she
cried
then
again
mamma
barba
wants
mamma
jefferson
worth
turned
sadly
away
his
head
bowed
as
though
with
disappointment
or
shame
the
others
now
in
turn
tried
to
win
her
confidence
the
plainsman
and
the
irishman
she
regarded
gravely
as
she
had
looked
at
the
banker
but
without
fear
the
boy
won
a
little
smile
but
she
still
held
back
hesitating
reluctant
then
with
a
pitiful
little
gesture
of
confidence
and
trust
she
stretched
forth
her
arms
to
the
big
engineer
barba
wants
drink
she
said
and
the
seer
took
her
in
his
arms
at
the
wagon
it
was
jefferson
worth
who
offered
her
a
tin
cup
of
water
but
again
she
shrank
from
him
throwing
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
seer
the
engineer
taking
the
cup
from
the
banker
hands
gave
her
a
drink
while
worth
and
the
boy
prepared
a
hasty
meal
texas
fed
his
team
and
the
irishman
going
back
a
short
distance
made
still
another
grave
beside
the
road
already
marked
by
so
many
the
child
still
in
the
engineer
arms
ate
hungrily
and
when
the
meal
was
over
he
took
her
to
the
wagon
while
the
others
with
a
lantern
returned
to
the
still
form
by
the
dry
water
hole
at
the
banker
suggestion
a
thorough
examination
of
the
woman
clothing
was
made
for
some
clue
to
her
identity
but
no
mark
was
found
with
careful
hands
they
reverently
wrapped
the
body
in
a
blanket
and
laid
it
away
in
its
rude
sandy
bed
when
the
grave
was
filled
and
protected
as
best
it
could
be
a
short
consultation
was
held
worth
wished
to
return
to
the
half
buried
outfit
to
make
another
effort
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
victim
but
texas
refused
that
i
ai
willin
to
do
right
he
said
but
you
see
how
that
sand
acted
why
worth
you
could
move
that
there
drift
in
a
year
an
you
know
it
i
jest
gave
the
mules
the
last
water
they
get
an
we
goin
to
have
all
we
can
do
to
make
it
through
as
it
is
if
we
wait
to
go
back
there
ai
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
ever
see
rubio
city
again
it
sense
to
risk
killin
the
kid
when
we
got
a
chance
to
save
her
jest
on
a
slim
chance
o
findin
out
who
she
is
returning
to
the
outfit
they
very
quietly
so
as
not
to
awaken
the
sleeping
child
hitched
the
team
to
the
wagon
and
took
their
places
as
the
mules
started
the
baby
stirred
uneasily
in
the
seer
arms
and
murmured
sleepily
mamma
but
the
low
soothing
tones
of
the
big
man
calmed
her
and
she
slept
hour
after
hour
of
the
long
night
dragged
by
they
had
left
the
sand
hills
behind
three
miles
before
they
reached
dry
river
and
now
the
wide
level
reaches
of
the
thinly
covered
plain
forbidding
and
ghostly
under
the
stars
seemed
to
stretch
away
on
every
side
into
infinite
space
involuntarily
all
the
members
of
the
little
party
except
texas
joe
strained
their
eyes
looking
into
the
blank
silent
distance
for
lights
and
as
they
looked
they
turned
their
heads
constantly
to
listen
for
some
sound
of
human
life
but
in
all
that
vast
expanse
there
was
no
light
save
the
light
of
the
stars
in
all
that
silent
waste
there
was
no
sound
save
the
occasional
call
of
the
coyote
the
plaintive
quivering
note
of
the
the
muffled
fall
of
the
mules
feet
in
the
soft
earth
and
the
dull
chuck
creak
and
rumble
of
the
wagon
with
the
clink
of
trace
chains
and
the
squeak
of
straining
harness
leather
and
always
it
was
as
though
that
dreadful
land
clung
to
them
with
heavy
hands
matching
its
strength
against
the
strength
of
these
who
braved
its
silent
threat
seeking
to
hold
them
as
it
held
so
many
others
the
men
spoke
rarely
and
then
in
low
tones
the
baby
in
the
seer
arms
slept
only
texas
and
perhaps
his
team
knew
how
they
kept
the
dimly
marked
trail
that
led
to
life
perhaps
texas
himself
did
not
know
at
daybreak
they
halted
for
a
brief
rest
and
for
breakfast
the
child
ate
with
the
others
but
still
clung
to
the
engineer
and
while
asking
often
for
mamma
seemed
to
trust
her
big
protector
fully
from
the
shelter
of
his
arms
she
even
smiled
at
the
efforts
of
texas
pat
and
the
boy
to
amuse
and
keep
her
attention
from
her
loss
from
jefferson
worth
she
still
shrank
in
fear
and
the
others
wondered
at
the
pain
in
that
gray
face
as
all
his
efforts
to
win
a
smile
or
a
kind
look
from
the
baby
were
steadily
repulsed
it
was
texas
who
when
they
halted
poured
the
last
of
the
water
from
the
barrel
into
the
canteen
and
carefully
measured
out
to
each
a
small
portion
it
was
texas
now
who
gave
the
word
to
start
again
on
their
journey
and
when
the
desert
man
placed
the
canteen
with
their
meager
supply
of
water
in
the
corner
of
the
under
his
own
feet
the
others
understood
and
made
no
comment
at
noon
when
each
was
given
his
carefully
measured
portion
from
the
canteen
jefferson
worth
before
they
could
check
him
wet
his
handkerchief
with
his
share
of
the
water
and
gave
it
to
the
seer
to
wipe
the
dust
from
the
hot
little
face
of
the
child
the
eyes
of
the
big
engineer
filled
and
texas
with
an
oath
that
was
more
reverent
than
profane
poured
another
measure
and
forced
the
banker
to
drink
as
the
long
hot
thirsty
hours
of
that
afternoon
dragged
slowly
past
the
faces
of
the
men
grew
worn
and
haggard
the
two
days
and
nights
in
the
trying
storm
the
exertion
of
their
search
among
the
sand
hills
the
excitement
of
finding
the
woman
body
and
the
discovery
of
the
child
followed
by
the
long
sleepless
night
and
now
the
hard
hot
dreary
hours
of
the
struggle
with
the
desert
that
seemed
to
gather
all
its
dreadful
strength
against
them
were
beginning
to
tell
texas
joe
forced
to
give
constant
attention
to
his
team
and
hardened
by
years
of
experience
showed
the
strain
least
while
pat
unfitted
for
such
a
trial
by
his
protracted
spree
in
san
felipe
undoubtedly
suffered
most
after
dinner
the
irishman
sat
motionless
in
his
place
with
downcast
face
lifting
his
head
only
at
long
intervals
to
gaze
with
fierce
hot
eyes
upon
the
barren
landscape
while
muttering
to
himself
in
a
growling
undertone
later
he
seemed
to
sink
into
a
stupor
and
appeared
to
be
scarcely
conscious
of
his
companions
suddenly
he
roused
himself
and
bending
forward
with
a
quick
motion
reached
the
canteen
from
under
the
driver
seat
in
the
act
of
unscrewing
the
cap
he
was
halted
by
the
of
texas
put
that
back
go
to
hell
wid
ye
i
no
herrin
the
cap
came
loose
but
as
he
raised
the
canteen
and
lifted
his
face
with
open
parched
lips
he
looked
straight
into
the
muzzle
of
the
big
and
back
of
the
gun
into
the
steady
eyes
of
the
plainsman
i
sorry
pard
but
you
ca
do
it
for
an
instant
the
irishman
sat
as
if
suddenly
turned
to
stone
the
water
was
within
reach
of
his
lips
but
over
the
canteen
certain
death
looked
at
him
for
there
was
no
mistaking
the
expression
on
the
face
of
that
man
with
the
gun
beside
himself
with
thirst
forgetting
everything
but
the
water
and
utterly
reckless
he
growled
shoot
be
domned
ye
murderin
savage
and
again
started
to
lift
the
vessel
at
that
instant
the
baby
catching
sight
of
the
canteen
called
from
the
rear
seat
barba
wants
drink
barba
thirsty
too
as
though
texas
had
pulled
the
trigger
the
irishman
dropped
his
hand
slowly
he
looked
from
face
to
face
of
his
companions
a
dazed
expression
on
his
own
countenance
as
though
he
were
awakening
from
a
dream
the
child
clinging
to
the
seer
with
one
hand
and
pointing
with
the
other
said
again
barba
thirsty
please
give
barba
drink
a
look
of
horror
and
shame
went
over
the
face
of
the
irishman
his
form
shook
like
a
leaf
and
his
trembling
hands
could
scarcely
hold
the
canteen
my
gawd
bhoys
he
cried
fwhat
this
i
was
doin
then
he
burst
suddenly
upon
tex
with
why
the
hell
do
ye
shoot
domn
ye
a
baste
like
me
is
fit
for
nothin
but
to
rot
in
this
land
the
fierce
rage
of
the
man
at
his
own
act
was
pitiful
texas
dropped
his
gun
into
the
holster
and
turned
his
face
away
jefferson
worth
held
out
a
cup
give
the
little
one
some
water
pat
he
said
in
his
cold
exact
way
with
shaking
hands
the
irishman
poured
a
little
into
the
cup
and
screwing
the
cap
back
on
the
canteen
he
returned
it
to
its
place
then
with
a
groan
he
bowed
his
face
in
his
great
hairy
hands
just
before
they
climbed
up
the
ancient
beach
line
to
the
rim
of
the
basin
and
the
mesa
on
the
east
halting
here
for
a
brief
rest
and
for
supper
they
looked
back
over
the
low
wide
land
through
which
they
had
come
all
along
the
western
sky
and
far
to
the
southward
the
mountains
lifted
their
purple
heights
from
the
dun
plain
a
seemingly
impassable
barrier
shutting
in
the
land
of
death
shutting
out
the
life
that
came
to
their
feet
on
the
other
side
to
the
north
the
hills
that
rim
the
basin
caught
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
and
glowed
and
pink
and
salmon
with
deep
purple
shadows
where
canyons
opened
all
rising
out
of
drifts
of
silvery
light
to
the
northwest
two
distant
gleaming
peaks
of
the
coast
range
marked
san
antonio
pass
to
the
west
lone
mountain
showed
dark
blue
against
the
purple
of
the
hills
beyond
down
in
the
desert
basin
drifting
above
and
woven
through
the
masses
of
color
shimmering
phantom
lakes
and
dull
dusky
patches
of
green
and
brown
long
streamers
bars
and
threads
of
dust
shone
like
gleaming
gold
texas
joe
when
he
had
poured
for
each
his
portion
of
water
shook
the
canteen
carefully
and
a
smile
spread
slowly
over
his
features
what
left
belongs
to
the
kid
he
said
but
we
make
it
we
jest
about
make
it
the
irishman
lifted
his
cup
toward
the
desert
saying
solemnly
to
ye
domn
ye
ye
ai
got
us
yet
may
ye
burn
an
blishther
scorch
an
bake
yer
danged
heart
shrivels
up
an
blows
away
then
he
fell
to
amusing
the
child
with
loving
and
queer
antics
until
she
laughed
aloud
and
permitted
him
to
catch
her
up
in
his
big
hairy
hands
and
to
toss
her
high
in
the
air
texas
and
abe
joining
in
the
frolic
shared
with
pat
the
little
lady
favor
while
the
seer
looked
smilingly
on
but
when
jefferson
worth
approached
with
an
offering
of
pretty
stones
and
shells
which
he
had
gathered
on
the
old
beach
she
ran
up
to
the
engineer
arms
still
coaxing
the
banker
held
out
his
offering
the
others
were
silent
watching
timidly
at
last
the
child
put
forth
her
little
hands
and
accepted
the
gift
shrinking
back
quickly
with
her
treasures
to
the
shelter
of
the
big
man
arms
it
was
just
after
noon
the
next
day
when
the
men
at
the
wagon
yard
on
the
edge
of
rubio
city
looked
up
to
see
jefferson
worth
outfit
approaching
the
team
staggered
weakly
through
the
gate
on
the
driver
seat
sat
a
haggard
begrimed
figure
holding
the
reins
in
his
right
hand
and
in
his
lap
supported
by
his
free
arm
a
little
girl
lay
fast
asleep
then
as
one
of
the
mules
lay
down
the
men
went
forward
on
the
run
texas
stared
at
them
dully
for
a
moment
then
as
he
dropped
the
reins
his
parched
cracked
lips
parted
in
what
was
meant
for
a
smile
and
he
said
in
a
thick
choking
whisper
we
made
it
boys
we
jest
made
it
somebody
take
the
kid
eager
hands
relieved
him
of
his
burden
and
he
slid
heavily
to
the
ground
to
stand
dizzily
holding
on
to
a
wheel
for
support
one
of
the
men
said
sharply
but
where
worth
tex
what
have
you
done
with
jefferson
worth
an
what
you
doin
with
a
kid
texas
joe
gazed
at
the
questioner
steadily
as
if
summoning
all
his
strength
of
will
in
an
effort
to
think
hello
jack
why
damned
if
i
know
he
was
with
me
a
little
while
ago
the
engineer
the
banker
the
irishman
and
the
boy
were
lying
unconscious
on
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
chapter
iii
miss
barbara
worth
worth
sitting
on
the
wide
veranda
of
her
home
after
a
lonely
supper
lifted
her
eyes
frequently
from
the
work
in
her
lap
to
look
down
the
street
perhaps
it
was
unusual
for
a
banker
wife
to
be
darning
her
husband
socks
it
may
be
even
that
bankers
do
not
usually
wear
socks
that
have
been
darned
but
worth
was
not
sensible
that
her
task
was
at
all
strange
a
group
of
coming
into
town
for
an
pleasure
jogged
past
with
loud
laughter
and
spurs
and
there
jefferson
worth
place
said
one
d
reckon
he
make
good
corralin
all
the
money
there
is
in
the
world
now
and
then
a
carriage
filled
with
citizens
out
for
an
evening
ride
drove
slowly
by
the
people
in
the
carriages
always
saluted
worth
and
she
returned
their
salutations
with
a
prim
little
bow
but
no
one
stopped
to
chat
or
to
offer
her
a
seat
in
this
also
there
was
nothing
strange
to
the
woman
on
the
porch
of
the
big
empty
house
sometimes
the
people
in
the
carriages
entertaining
visiting
friends
pointed
to
jefferson
worth
house
with
proper
explanations
as
they
also
called
attention
to
the
pioneer
bank
jefferson
worth
bank
when
dusk
came
and
she
could
no
longer
see
worth
laid
aside
her
work
and
sat
with
folded
hands
her
face
turned
down
the
street
inside
the
house
the
lights
were
not
yet
on
there
was
no
need
for
them
and
she
liked
to
sit
in
the
dark
the
indian
servant
woman
came
softly
to
the
door

a

as
jefferson

and
the
seer
came
up
the
walk
the
engineer
carrying
the
little
girl
worth
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
run
quick
ynez
quick
the
lights
that
night
when
the
seer
with
everything
possible
done
for
his
comfort
had
retired
and
the
baby
bathed
and
fed
was
sound
asleep
in
a
child
bed
that
ynez
had
brought
from
an
unused
room
in
the
big
house
and
placed
in
worth
own
chamber
jefferson
worth
and
his
wife
crept
softly
to
the
little
girl
bedside
silently
they
looked
at
the
baby
form
under
the
coverlet
and
at
the
round
baby
face
with
the
tumbled
brown
hair
on
the
pillow
worth
clasped
her
hands
in
eager
longing
as
she
whispered
oh
jeff
can
we
keep
her
can
we
jefferson
worth
answered
in
his
careful
manner
did
you
look
for
marks
on
her
clothing
there
was
nothing
not
a
letter
even
and
all
that
she
can
tell
of
her
name
is
barba
i
sure
she
means
barbara
as
she
answered
worth
searched
her
husband
face
anxiously
then
she
exclaimed
oh
you
do
want
her
you
do
and
added
wistfully
of
course
we
must
try
to
find
her
folks
but
do
you
think
it
very
wrong
jeff
to
wish
to
wish
that
we
never
do
i
feel
as
though
she
were
sent
to
take
the
place
of
our
own
little
girl
we
need
her
so
jeff
i
need
her
so
and
you
you
will
need
her
when
there
was
a
day
coming
that
the
banker
and
his
wife
did
not
talk
about
since
the
birth
and
death
of
their
one
child
worth
had
been
a
hopeless
invalid
several
weeks
passed
and
every
effort
to
find
little
barbara
people
was
fruitless
inquiry
in
rubio
city
and
san
felipe
and
through
the
newspapers
on
the
coast
brought
no
returns
the
land
in
those
days
was
a
land
of
strangers
where
people
came
and
went
with
little
notice
and
were
lost
quickly
in
the
tide
it
was
not
at
all
strange
that
no
one
could
identify
an
outfit
of
which
it
was
possible
to
tell
only
of
a
woman
and
child
and
one
bay
horse
there
were
many
outfits
with
a
woman
and
child
in
the
party
and
many
that
had
among
the
two
four
six
or
more
animals
one
bay
horse
in
the
meantime
little
barbara
in
her
new
home
was
growing
gradually
away
from
all
that
had
gone
before
her
long
ride
in
the
big
wagon
with
the
men
already
she
was
beginning
to
talk
of
her
other
mamma
and
papa
worth
slipped
into
the
other
woman
place
in
the
childish
heart
even
as
little
barbara
filled
the
empty
of
the
woman
toward
worth
though
she
no
longer
shrank
from
him
in
fear
the
little
girl
maintained
an
attitude
of
questioning
regard
with
texas
or
pat
or
the
boy
abe
who
often
went
together
to
see
her
she
laughed
and
chattered
like
a
good
little
comrade
and
but
when
the
seer
came
as
he
did
whenever
his
duties
and
his
presence
in
town
would
permit
she
flew
to
him
with
eager
love
climbing
on
his
knee
or
snuggling
under
his
arm
with
entire
confidence
and
understanding
public
interest
in
rubio
city
keen
at
first
died
out
quickly
rubio
city
in
those
days
of
railroad
building
had
too
many
things
of
interest
to
retain
any
one
thing
long
still
because
it
was
jefferson
worth
rubio
city
could
not
altogether
drop
the
matter
so
it
was
one
evening
in
the
gold
bar
saloon
where
pat
coming
into
town
for
a
quiet
evening
from
the
grading
camp
on
the
new
road
and
texas
joe
who
was
just
back
from
another
trip

two

texas
joe
laughed
outright
let
have
another
drink
instead
he
said
in
the
silence
occasioned
by
the
of
their
glasses
the
two
friends
caught
the
name
of
jefferson
worth
instantly
their
attention
was
attracted
to
a
stranger
who
stood
at
the
bar
talking
loudly
to
a
man
known
to
rubio
city
as
a
promoter
of
somewhat
doubtful
mining
schemes
pat
and
texas
listened
with
amused
interest
while
the
two
in
concert
cursed
jefferson
worth
with
careful
and
exhaustive
attention
to
details
go
to
it
gentlemen
put
in
the
as
he
returned
to
his
place
from
the
table
in
the
corner

house
he
graciously
helped
them
to
more

high
with

congregation
drawled
texas
joe
to
his
companion
hst
whispered
pat
they
askin
afther
the
kid
the
casual
amused
interest
of
the
two
friends
became
intense
they
sure
tried
everything
to
find
her
folks
the
saloon
man
was
saying
but
there
ai
no
thin
doin
so
far
they
say
if
nobody
shows
up
with
a
claim
jefferson
worth
is
goin
to
adopt
her
an
bring
her
up
like
his
own
this
statement
of
jefferson
worth
intentions
called
forth
from
the
stranger
an
exhaustive
opinion
as
to
the
banker
fitness
to
have
the
child
and
her
probable
chances
for
right
training
and
happiness
in
the
financier
hands
his
remarks
being
cordially
commended
by
the
promoter
and
the
man
in
the
white
apron
the
speaker
was
encouraged
to
strengthen
his
position
in
reference
to
the
future
of
this
poor
helpless
orphan
and
to
point
out
freely
the
duties
of
rubio
city
in
the
matter
he
was
interrupted
by
a
light
hand
on
his
shoulder
turning
with
a
start
that
spilled
the
liquor
in
his
glass
he
looked
into
the
lean
face
of
texas
joe
behind
the
plainsman
stood
the
heavy
form
of
the
irishman
a
look
of
pleased
anticipation
on
his
features
there
was
a
sudden
sympathetic
hush
in
the
room
every
face
was
turned
toward
the
group
excuse

stranger
said
texas
in
his
softest
tones
but
i
sure
am
moved
to
testify
in
this
here
meetin
the
man
would
have
made
some
angry
blustering
reply
but
a
warning
look
from
the
promoter
and
a
slight
cough
from
the
checked
him
tex
proceeded
that

chapter
iv
you

make
it
ninety
fifteen
years
of
a
changing
age
left
few
marks
on
rubio
city
luxurious
overland
trains
filled
with
tourists
now
stopped
at
the
depot
where
under
the
pepper
trees
sadly
civilized
indians
sold
kansas
city
and
new
curios
stopped
and
went
on
again
along
the
rim
of
the
king
basin
through
san
antonio
pass
to
the
great
cities
on
the
western
edge
of
the
continent
but
the
town
on
the
banks
of
the
colorado
in
an
almost
rainless
land
had
little
to
build
upon
still
on
the
street
mingled
the

and

from
prospecting
trip
mine
or
ranch
the
adventurer
the
promoter
the
indian
the
mexican
the
frontier
business
man
and
the
tourist
but
there
were
few
of
the
citizens
of
rubio
city
now
who
knew
the
story
of
the
baby
girl
whom
jefferson
worth
and
his
party
had
found
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
for
though
rubio
city
was
changed
but
little
since
that
day
when
texas
joe
brought
the
outfit
with
the
child
safely
out
of
the
desert
the
people
came
and
went
always
as
is
the
manner
of
their
moving
kind
the
few
who
remained
had
long
ceased
to
tell
the
story
no
one
thought
of
the
young
woman
who
rode
down
the
street
that
afternoon
save
only
as
the
daughter
of
jefferson
worth
as
she
passed
the
people
turned
to
follow
her
with
their
eyes
the
with
smiles
of
recognition
and
picturesque
words
of
admiring
comment
the
townspeople
with
cheerful
greetings
a
wave
of
the
hand
or
a
nod
when
they
caught
her
eye
the
strangers
from
the
east
with
curious
interest
and
ready
kodaks
here
the
visitors
told
themselves
was
the
real
west
how
interesting
gasped
a
woman
tourist
to
her
escort
look
george
she
is
wearing
a
divided
skirt
and
riding
a
saddle
and
look
quick
where
your
camera
she
has
a
revolver
that
revolver
a
dainty
but
effective
weapon
was
a
gift
to
barbara
from
her
uncles
texas
and
pat
and
though
ornamental
was
not
for
ornament
the
girl
often
went
alone
as
she
was
going
for
a
long
ride
out
on
the
mesa
and
the
country
still
harbored
many
wild
and
lawless
characters
but
the
tailored
woman
tourist
did
not
need
to
urge
george
to
look
there
was
something
about
the
girl
on
the
spirited
horse
that
challenged
attention
the
figure
was
so
richly
alive
there
was
such
a
wealth
of
vitality
such
an
abundance
of
young
woman
strength
such
a
glow
of
red
blood
expressed
in
every
curved
line
and
revealed
in
every
graceful
movement
that
the
attraction
was
irresistible
to
look
at
barbara
worth
was
a
pleasure
to
be
near
her
was
a
delight
at
the
pioneer
bank
the
girl
cheeked
her
horse
and
swinging
lightly
to
the
ground
threw
the
reins
over
the
animal
head
thus
tying
him
in
western
fashion
as
she
stood
now
on
the
sidewalk
laughing
and
chatting
with
a
group
of
friends
who
had
paused
in
passing
to
greet
her
her
beautiful
figure
lost
none
of
the
compelling
charm
that
made
her
on
horseback
so
good
to
look
at
every
movement
and
gesture
expressed
perfect
health
the
firm
flesh
of
her
rounded
cheeks
and
full
throat
was
warmly
browned
and
glowing
with
the
abundance
of
red
blood
in
her
veins
though
framed
in
a
mass
of
waving
brown
hair
under
a
wide
sombrero
her
features
were
not
pretty
the
mouth
was
perhaps
a
bit
too
large
though
it
was
a
good
mouth
and
as
she
laughed
with
her
companions
revealed
teeth
that
were
faultless
but
something
looked
out
of
her
brown
eyes
and
made
itself
felt
in
every
poise
and
movement
that
forced
one
to
forget
to
be
critical
it
was
the
wholesome
challenging
lure
of
an
unmarred
womanhood
oh
barbara
how
could
you
how
you
miss
last
thursday
afternoon
at
miss
colson
we
had
a
perfectly
lovely
time
cried
a
vivacious
member
of
the
little
group
yes
indeed
young
lady
explanations
are
in
order
added
another
miss
colson
did
like
it
a
bit
she
had
an
exquisite
luncheon
and
you
know
how
people
depend
upon
your
appreciation
of
good
things
to
eat
well
you
see
answered
barbara
turning
to
pat
her
horse
neck
as
the
animal
edging
closer
to
her
side
rubbed
his
soft
muzzle
coaxingly
against
her
shoulder
pilot
and
i
were
out
on
the
mesa
and
he
said
he
did
want
to
come
back
pilot
does
care
at
all
for
afternoon
parties
do
you
old
boy
with
another
pat
so
what
could
i
do
i
did
like
to
hurt
miss
colson
feelings
of
course
but
i
like
to
hurt
pilot
feelings
either
and
the
day
was
so
perfect
and
pilot
was
feeling
so
good
and
we
were
having
such
fun
together
i
guess
it
was
a
case
of
bird
in
the
hand
or
being
nine
points
you
know
or
something
like
that
only
for
pity
sake
girls
do
tell
miss
colson
i
said
that
they
all
laughed
understandingly
and
the
vivacious
one
said
i
guess
it
was
possession
all
right
could
anything
on
earth
induce
you
to
give
up
your
horse
and
your
desert
barbara
inside
the
bank
jefferson
worth
with
his
customary
careful
exact
manner
was
explaining
to
a
small
rancher
that
it
was
impossible
to
extend
the
loan
secured
by
a
mortgage
on
the
farmer
property
personally
worth
would
be
glad
to
accommodate
him
but
the
loan
had
already
been
extended
three
times
and
there
were
good
reasons
why
the
bank
must
call
it
in
the
farmer
must
remember
that
a
bank
duty
to
its
stockholders
and
depositors
was
sacred
it
was
not
a
question
of
the
farmer
honesty
it
was
altogether
a
question
of
good
business
the
farmer
was
agitated
and
presented
his
case
desperately
worth
knew
the
situation
the
unforeseen
circumstances
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
pay
then
only
two
months
more
were
needed
until
his
new
crop
matured
he
could
not
blame
worth
of
course
he
understood
that
it
was
business
but
still
the
farmer
searched
that
cold
face
for
a
ray
of
hope
as
a
man
might
hold
out
his
hands
for
pity
to
a
machine
he
was
made
to
feel
somehow
that
the
banker
was
not
a
man
with
human
blood
but
a
mechanical
something
governed
and
run
by
a
mighty
irresistible
power
with
which
it
had
nothing
to
do
save
to
obey
as
a
locomotive
obeys
its
steam
jefferson
worth
began
explaining
again
in
exact
precise
tones
that
the
loan
wholly
for
business
reasons
was
impossible
when
barbara
entered
the
bank
as
the
girl
greeted
the
teller
in
front
her
voice
full
and
rich
with
the
same
unconscious
power
that
looked
out
of
her
eyes
and
spoke
in
every
movement
of
her
body
came
through
the
bronze
grating
at
the
window
and
carried
down
the
room
jefferson
worth
paused
with
the
farmer
he
faced
the
open
door
of
his
apartment
every
man
in
the
place
looked
up
the
clerks
smilingly
answered
her
greeting
and
turned
back
to
their
books
with
renewed
energy
the
cashier
straightened
up
from
his
papers
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
exchanged
a
jest
with
her
as
she
passed
oh
excuse
me
father
i
thought
you
were
alone
how
do
you
do
wheeler
and
how
is
wheeler
and
that
dear
little
baby
the
man
face
lighted
his
form
straightened
his
voice
rang
out
heartily
fine
miss
barbara
fine
thank
you
all
we
need
in
the
world
now
is
for
your
father
to
give
me
time
enough
on
that
blamed
note
to
make
a
crop
barbara
worth
was
just
tall
enough
to
look
straight
into
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
now
the
banker
felt
a
little
as
he
had
felt
that
night
in
the
desert
when
the
baby
whose
dead
mother
lay
beside
the
dry
water
hole
shrank
back
from
him
in
fear
oh
i
sure
father
will
be
glad
to
do
that
the
girl
said
eagerly
wo
you
father
you
know
how
hard
wheeler
works
and
what
trouble
he
has
had
and
i
want
some
money
too
she
added
that
what
i
came
in
for
the
farmer
laughed
loudly
jefferson
worth
smiled
but
i
do
want
it
for
myself
barbara
went
on
quickly
smiling
at
them
both
i
want
it
for
that
poor
mexican
family
down
by
the
wagon
yard
the
garcias
pablo
leg
was
broken
in
the
mines
you
know
and
there
is
no
one
to
look
after
his
mother
and
the
children
someone
must
care
for
them
they
were
interrupted
by
a
clerk
who
handed
a
paper
to
the
banker
this
is
ready
for
your
signature
sir
jefferson
worth
face
was
again
a
cold
gray
mask
methodically
he
affixed
his
name
to
the
document
then
to
the
clerk
you
may
give
miss
worth
whatever
money
she
wants
the
employe
smiled
as
he
answered
yes
sir
and
withdrew
barbara
turned
to
follow
wheeler
tell
wheeler
going
to
ride
out
to
see
her
soon
i
have
forgotten
that
good
buttermilk
you
see
miss
barbara
i
tell
the
wife
we
always
glad
to
see
you
the
farmer
could
not
have
said
that
jefferson
worth
face
changed
or
that
his
voice
altered
a
shade
in
tone
as
they
turned
again
to
the
business
in
hand
i
guess
we
can
fix
you
out
this
time
wheeler
sixty
days
you
say
you
better
make
it
ninety
so
you
will
not
be
crowded
in
marketing
your
crop
quickly
the
black
horse
carrying
barbara
passed
through
the
streets
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
the
adobe
houses
of
the
earlier
days
with
tents
and
shacks
of
every
description
were
scattered
in
careless
disorder
to
the
very
edge
of
the
barren
mesa
beyond
the
wagon
yard
barbara
turned
pilot
toward
a
whitewashed
house
that
stood
by
itself
on
the
extreme
outskirts
her
approach
was
announced
by
the
loud
barking
of
a
lean
dog
and
the
joyful
shouts
of
three
mexican
children
and
as
the
horse
stopped
a
woman
appeared
in
the
low
doorway
buenas
dias
senorita
she
called
then
still
in
her
native
tongue
manuel
take
the
lady
horse
you
juanita
drive
that
dog
away
this
is
not
the
manner
to
receive
a
lady
come
in
come
in
senorita
may
god
bless
you
for
a
good
friend
to
the
poor
come
in
everything
about
the
place
although
showing
unmistakable
signs
of
poverty
was
clean
and
orderly
while
the
manner
of
the
woman
though
quietly
respectful
and
warmly
grateful
showed
a
dignified
in
one
corner
of
the
room
on
a
rude
bed
lay
a
young
man
the
girl
returned
the
woman
greeting
kindly
in
spanish
and
going
to
the
bedside
spoke
still
in
the
soft
musical
tongue
of
the
south
to
the
man
how
are
you
pablo
is
the
leg
getting
better
all
right
si
senorita
thank
you
he
replied
his
dark
face
beaming
with
gladness
and
gratitude
and
his
eyes
looking
up
at
her
with
an
expression
of
dumb
devotion
yes
i
think
it
gets
better
right
along
but
it
is
slow
and
it
is
hard
to
lie
here
doing
nothing
for
the
mother
and
the
children
god
knows
what
would
become
of
us
if
it
were
not
for
your
goodness
la
senorita
is
an
angel
of
mercy
we
can
never
repay
the
people
were
of
the
better
class
of
industrious
poor
mexicans
the
father
was
dead
and
pablo
the
eldest
son
who
was
the
little
sole
support
had
been
hurt
in
the
mine
some
two
weeks
before
barbara
visited
them
every
few
days
caring
for
their
wants
as
indeed
she
helped
many
of
rubio
city
worthy
poor
for
this
work
jefferson
worth
gave
her
without
question
all
the
money
that
she
asked
and
often
expressed
his
interest
in
his
own
cold
way
even
telling
her
of
certain
cases
that
came
to
his
notice
from
time
to
time
so
the
daughter
was
hailed
as
an
angel
of
mercy
and
greatly
loved
by
the
same
class
that
feared
and
cursed
her
father
for
a
little
while
the
girl
talked
to
pablo
and
his
mother
cheerfully
and
encouragingly
with
understanding
asking
after
their
needs
then
placing
a
gold
piece
in
the
woman
hand
and
promising
to
come
again
she
bade
them
adios
for
a
short
distance
barbara
now
followed
the
old
san
felipe
trail
along
which
as
a
baby
she
had
been
brought
by
her
friends
to
jefferson
worth
home
but
where
the
old
road
crosses
the
railroad
tracks
and
leads
northwest
into
the
king
basin
the
girl
turned
to
the
right
toward
the
end
of
that
range
of
low
hills
that
rims
the
desert
as
her
horse
traveled
up
the
long
gradual
slope
in
the
easy
swinging
lope
of
western
saddle
stock
the
view
grew
wider
and
wider
the
sun
poured
its
flood
of
white
light
down
upon
the
broad
mesa
and
away
in
the
distance
the
king
basin
lay
a
magic
constantly
changing
ocean
of
soft
colors
nearer
ahead
were
the
hills
brown
and
tawny
with
blue
shadows
in
the
canyons
shading
to
rose
and
lilac
and
purple
as
they
stretched
their
long
lengths
away
toward
the
lofty
sentinels
of
the
pass
free
from
the
city
with
its
many
odors
the
dry
air
was
invigorating
like
wine
and
came
to
her
rich
with
the
smell
of
the
plains
the
girl
breathed
deeply
her
cheeks
glowed
her
eyes
shone
even
her
horse
seeming
to
catch
her
spirit
arched
his
neck
and
in
sheer
joy
of
living
pretended
to
be
frightened
now
and
then
at
something
that
was
really
nothing
at
all
at
the
foot
of
the
first
low
rounded
hill
barbara
faced
pilot
to
the
northwest
and
bade
him
stand
still
motionless
now
the
girl
sat
in
her
saddle
looking
away
over
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
it
was
to
this
point
that
barbara
so
often
came
and
as
she
looked
now
over
the
miles
and
miles
of
that
silent
dreadful
land
her
face
grew
sad
and
wistful
and
in
her
eyes
there
was
an
expression
that
the
seer
sometimes
said
made
him
think
of
the
desert
gentle
worth
had
lived
just
long
enough
to
leave
an
indelible
impression
of
her
simple
genuineness
upon
the
life
of
the
child
who
had
come
to
take
in
her
heart
the
place
left
vacant
by
the
death
of
her
own
baby
girl
since
the
loss
of
her
second
mother
the
girl
had
lived
with
no
woman
companion
save
the
indian
woman
ynez
and
it
was
the
seer
rather
than
jefferson
worth
to
whom
she
turned
in
fullest
confidence
and
trust
the
childish
instinct
that
had
led
the
baby
to
the
big
engineer
arms
that
night
on
the
desert
had
never
wavered
through
the
years
when
she
was
growing
into
womanhood
and
the
seer
whose
work
after
the
completion
of
the
and
called
him
to
many
parts
of
the
west
managed
every
few
months
a
visit
to
the
girl
he
loved
as
his
own
to
worth
who
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
was
in
all
things
a
father
to
her
barbara
gave
in
return
a
daughter
love
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
enter
into
the
life
of
the
banker
as
she
entered
into
the
life
of
the
engineer
so
it
was
the
seer
who
became
after
worth
the
dominant
influence
in
forming
the
character
of
the
motherless
girl
his
dreams
of
reclamation
his
plans
and
efforts
to
lead
the
world
to
recognize
the
value
of
that
great
work
with
his
failures
and
disappointments
she
shared
at
an
early
age
with
peculiar
sympathy
for
she
had
not
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
tragic
part
the
desert
had
played
in
her
own
life
particularly
did
the
king
basin
desert
interest
her
she
felt
that
in
a
way
it
belonged
to
her
that
she
belonged
to
it
it
was
desert
its
desolation
she
shared
its
waiting
she
understood
something
of
its
mystery
colored
her
life
something
within
her
answered
to
its
call
it
was
her
desert
she
feared
it
hated
it
loved
it
often
as
barbara
sat
looking
over
that
great
basin
her
heart
cried
out
to
know
the
secret
it
held
who
was
she
who
were
her
people
what
was
the
name
to
which
she
had
been
born
what
was
the
life
from
which
the
desert
had
taken
her
but
no
answer
to
her
cry
had
ever
come
from
the
awful
hollow
of
god
hand
before
barbara
had
left
her
home
that
afternoon
a
man
walking
with
long
easy
stride
followed
the
san
felipe
trail
out
from
the
city
on
to
the
mesa
he
was
a
tall
man
and
of
so
angular
and
lean
a
figure
that
his
body
seemed
made
up
mostly
of
bone
somewhat
loosely
fastened
together
with
sinews
almost
as
hard
as
the
his
face
thin
and
rugged
was
burned
to
the
color
of
saddle
leather
he
was
dressed
in
corduroy
trousers
belted
and
tucked
in
boots
a
soft
gray
shirt
and
slouch
hat
and
over
his
square
shoulders
was
the
strap
of
a
small
canteen
his
long
legs
carried
him
over
the
ground
at
an
astonishing
rate
so
that
before
barbara
had
left
the
mexicans
the
pedestrian
had
gained
the
foot
of
the
low
hill
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
with
remarkable
ease
the
man
ascended
the
rough
steep
side
of
the
hill
where
selecting
a
convenient
rock
he
seated
himself
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
wonderful
scene
that
from
his
feet
stretched
away
miles
and
miles
to
the
purple
mountain
wall
on
the
west
so
still
was
he
and
so
intent
in
his
study
of
the
landscape
that
a
which
had
dodged
under
the
edge
of
the
rock
at
his
approach
crept
forth
again
venturing
quite
to
the
edge
of
his
boot
heel
and
a
lizard
scaling
the
rock
at
his
back
almost
touched
his
shoulder
when
barbara
had
left
the
san
felipe
trail
and
was
riding
toward
the
hills
the
man
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
moving
spot
on
the
mesa
and
he
stirred
to
take
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
a
field
glass
while
at
his
movement
the
and
the
lizard
scurried
to
cover
adjusting
his
glass
he
easily
made
out
the
figure
of
the
girl
on
horseback
who
was
coming
in
his
direction
he
turned
again
to
his
study
of
the
landscape
but
later
when
the
horse
and
rider
had
drawn
nearer
lifted
his
glass
for
another
look
this
time
he
did
not
turn
away
rapidly
as
barbara
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
details
of
her
dress
and
equipment
became
more
distinct
until
the
man
with
the
glass
could
even
make
out
the
fringe
on
her
gauntlets
the
contour
of
her
face
and
the
color
of
her
hair
when
she
stopped
and
turned
to
look
over
the
desert
below
he
forgot
the
scene
that
had
so
interested
him
and
continued
to
gaze
at
her
until
as
the
girl
turned
her
face
in
his
direction
and
apparently
looked
straight
at
him
he
dropped
the
glass
in
embarrassed
confusion
forgetting
for
the
instant
that
at
that
distance
with
his
gray
and
yellow
clothing
so
matching
the
ground
and
rock
he
would
not
be
noticed
with
a
low
chuckle
at
his
absurd
situation
he
recovered
himself
and
again
lifting
the
glass
turned
it
upon
barbara
who
was
now
riding
swiftly
toward
the
mouth
of
a
little
canyon
that
opened
behind
the
hill
where
he
sat
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
the
young
man
sprang
to
his
feet
the
running
horse
had
stumbled
and
fallen
after
a
few
struggling
efforts
to
rise
the
animal
lay
still
the
girl
did
not
move
with
long
leaping
strides
the
man
plunged
down
the
rough
steep
side
of
the
hill
when
barbara
slowly
opened
her
eyes
she
was
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
canyon
wall
some
distance
from
the
spot
where
her
horse
had
stumbled
still
dazed
with
the
shock
of
her
fall
she
looked
slowly
around
striving
to
collect
her
scattered
senses
she
knew
the
place
but
could
not
remember
how
she
came
there
and
where
was
her
horse
pilot
and
how
came
that
canteen
on
the
ground
by
her
side
at
this
she
sat
up
and
looked
around
just
in
time
to
see
a
tall
gaunt
figure
coming
toward
her
from
the
direction
of
the
canyon
mouth
instantly
the
girl
reached
for
her
gun
the
holster
was
empty
the
man
quite
close
now
seeing
the
suggestive
gesture
halted
then
coming
nearer
silently
held
out
her
own
revolver
still
confused
and
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
before
barbara
caught
the
weapon
from
the
hand
and
in
a
flash
covered
the
silent
stranger
very
deliberately
the
fellow
drew
back
a
few
paces
and
stretched
both
hands
high
above
his
head
who
are
you
asked
the
girl
sharply
a
white
man
he
answered
whimsically
adding
as
if
it
were
an
afterthought
and
a
gentleman
but
why
did
i
get
here
where
did
you
come
from
i
was
up
on
the
hill
back
there
i
saw
your
horse
fall
and
went
to
you
the
quickest
way
you
were
unconscious
and
i
carried
you
here
out
of
the
sun
i
remember
now
said
barbara
we
were
running
and
pilot
fell
he
must
have
stepped
into
a
hole
she
put
up
her
free
hand
to
her
forehead
and
found
it
wet
her
eyes
fell
on
the
canteen
and
the
color
came
back
into
her
face
with
a
rush
but
you
have
told
me
who
you
are
she
said
sternly
to
the
man
who
still
stood
with
hands
uplifted
i
a
surveyor
going
south
with
a
party
on
some
preliminary
work
we
arrived
in
rubio
city
this
morning
expecting
to
find
the
chief
who
wrote
me
from
new
york
to
meet
him
here
with
an
outfit
he
has
not
arrived
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
so
i
walked
out
on
the
mesa
to
have
another
look
at
this
king
basin
country
barbara
knew
that
the
seer
had
been
called
to
new
york
by
some
capitalists
who
had
become
interested
in
the
financial
possibilities
of
the
reclamation
work
at
the
stranger
explanation
of
his
presence
she
regarded
him
with
excited
interest
do
you
mean
is
it
the
seer
whom
you
expected
to
meet
are
you
with
him
the
young
man
smiled
gravely
i
was
sure
that
it
was
you
he
answered
you
are
the
little
girl
whom
we
found
in
the
desert
and
you
burst
forth
barbara
eagerly
you
must
be
abe
lee
the
surveyor
answered
whimsically
do
you
think
i
might
take
my
hands
down
now
i
unarmed
you
know
and
you
could
still
shoot
me
if
you
thought
i
needed
it
in
her
excitement
barbara
had
forgotten
that
she
still
held
her
weapon
pointed
straight
at
him
she
dropped
the
gun
with
a
confused
laugh
i
beg
your
pardon
a
lee
i
did
not
realize
that
i
was
holding
up
my
she
hesitated
then
finished
gravely
my
only
brother
a
quick
glad
light
flashed
into
the
sharp
blue
eyes
of
the
surveyor
you
have
not
forgotten
me
then
forgotten
when
father
and
the
seer
and
texas
and
pat
and
you
are
all
the
the
family
i
have
in
the
world
her
lips
quivered
but
she
went
on
bravely
the
seer
has
told
me
so
many
things
about
you
and
i
have
thought
about
you
so
much
but
i
did
not
realize
though
that
you
were
a
big
man
the
seer
always
speaks
of
you
as
a
boy
and
so
i
have
always
called
you
my
brother
abe
as
i
call
texas
and
pat
my
uncles
but
i
think
you
might
have
come
to
see
me
sometimes
why
you
come
straight
to
me
this
morning
instead
of
tramping
out
here
alone
abe
lee
was
silent
how
could
he
explain
the
place
in
his
life
that
was
filled
by
the
little
girl
whom
he
had
known
for
the
two
years
that
the
building
of
the
railroad
had
kept
him
with
the
seer
in
rubio
city
how
could
she
understand
the
poverty
and
grinding
hardship
of
his
boyhood
struggle
when
the
only
time
he
could
snatch
from
his
work
he
must
spend
on
his
books
while
she
was
growing
up
in
the
banker
home
he
was
more
alone
in
the
world
than
barbara
save
for
the
seer
he
had
no
one
texas
and
pat
he
had
met
at
intervals
when
they
came
together
on
some
construction
work
and
always
they
had
talked
about
her
while
the
engineer
had
often
told
him
of
barbara
interest
in
her
brother
and
sometimes
the
seer
even
shared
with
him
her
letters
but
all
this
had
only
served
to
emphasize
the
distance
that
lay
between
them
it
was
not
a
distance
of
miles
but
of
position
of
circumstances
the
nameless
little
waif
of
the
desert
had
become
the
daughter
of
jefferson
worth
the
child
of
the
mining
camp
was
abe
lee
so
when
at
last
his
work
had
brought
him
to
rubio
city
again
he
shrank
from
meeting
her
and
had
gone
out
on
to
the
mesa
to
look
away
over
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
to
be
alone
barbara
seeing
his
embarrassment
at
her
question
guessed
a
part
of
the
reason
and
gently
sought
to
relieve
the
situation
i
think
we
had
better
find
my
horse
and
start
for
home
now
she
said
the
thin
face
of
the
surveyor
was
filled
with
sympathy
as
he
replied
i
sorry
but
your
pony
is
down
and
out
down
and
out
pilot
oh
you
do
mean
you
do
abe
explained
simply
his
leg
was
broken
and
he
could
get
up
there
was
nothing
that
could
possibly
be
done
for
him
he
was
suffering
so
that
i
it
was
for
that
i
borrowed
your
gun
for
a
long
time
she
sat
very
still
and
the
man
understanding
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
quietly
went
a
little
way
up
the
canyon
around
the
jutting
edge
of
the
rocky
wall
deliberately
he
seated
himself
on
a
boulder
and
taking
from
the
pocket
of
his
flannel
shirt
tobacco
and
papers
rolled
a
cigarette
a
deep
inhalation
and
the
gray
cloud
rose
slowly
from
his
lips
and
nostrils
stooping
he
carefully
gathered
a
handful
of
sharp
pebbles
and
one
by
one
flipped
them
idly
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
canyon
another
generous
puff
of
smoke
and
a
second
handful
of
pebbles
followed
the
first
then
rising
he
dropped
the
cigarette
and
went
back
to
her
i
think
we
should
be
going
now
he
hesitated
sister
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
of
understanding
thank
you
abe
can
we
go
back
over
the
hill
there
do
you
think
i
i
do
want
to
see
him
again
together
they
climbed
the
low
hill
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
from
which
he
had
seen
the
accident
the
girl
resolutely
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
ahead
so
as
not
to
see
the
dead
horse
on
the
plain
below
when
the
top
of
the
hill
was
between
them
and
the
canyon
she
made
him
stop
and
together
they
stood
looking
down
and
far
away
over
the
wide
reaches
of
the
king
basin
is
it
grand
is
it
awful
she
said
in
a
low
reverent
tone
it
fairly
hurts
it
seems
to
be
calling
calling
waiting
waiting
for
some
one
sometimes
i
think
it
must
be
for
me
i
fear
it
hate
it
love
it
so
her
voice
vibrated
with
strong
passion
and
the
surveyor
looking
up
saw
her
intense
expression
and
felt
as
did
the
seer
that
somehow
she
was
like
the
desert
do
you
come
out
here
often
he
asked
curiously
yes
often
she
answered
i
could
not
get
along
without
my
desert
and
this
is
the
finest
place
to
see
it
the
seer
always
comes
out
here
with
me
when
he
can
do
you
think
that
land
will
ever
be
reclaimed
she
faced
him
with
the
question
why
no
one
can
say
about
that
you
know
he
answered
slowly
there
has
never
been
a
survey
well
she
declared
emphatically
i
know
it
will
be
listen
you
hear
it
calling
i
think
it
for
that
it
has
been
waiting
all
these
ages
the
surveyor
smiled
as
one
would
humor
a
child
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
now
you
are
laughing
at
me
she
returned
quickly
they
all
do
father
and
the
seer
and
texas
and
pat
but
you
shall
see
i
believe
though
that
the
seer
thinks
that
i
am
right
only
he
always
says
as
you
do
that
there
has
never
been
a
survey
and
sometimes
i
think
that
even
father
away
down
in
his
heart
believes
it
too
all
the
long
walk
to
barbara
home
they
talked
of
the
desert
and
the
seer
dreams
of
reclamation
and
abe
told
her
how
at
last
those
stupid
capitalists
as
barbara
called
them
had
opened
their
eyes
the
great
james
greenfield
himself
had
read
an
article
of
the
seer
on
reclamation
from
the
investor
point
of
view
and
had
written
him
as
a
result
of
their
correspondence
the
engineer
had
gone
to
new
york
and
now
a
company
organized
by
greenfield
was
sending
him
south
to
look
over
a
big
territory
and
to
report
on
the
possibilities
of
its
development
when
they
arrived
at
barbara
home
they
found
the
seer
himself
the
fifteen
years
had
made
no
perceptible
change
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
engineer
his
form
was
still
strongly
erect
and
vigorous
but
his
hair
was
a
little
gray
and
to
a
close
observer
his
face
in
repose
revealed
a
touch
of
sadness
that
indescribable
look
of
one
who
is
beginning
to
feel
less
sure
of
himself
or
rather
who
from
many
disappointments
is
beginning
to
question
whether
he
will
live
to
see
his
most
cherished
plans
carried
to
completion
not
because
he
has
less
faith
in
his
visions
but
because
he
has
less
hope
that
he
will
be
able
to
make
them
clear
to
others
when
the
evening
meal
was
over
the
surveyor
said
for
the
expedition
was
to
start
in
the
morning
and
he
had
some
work
to
do
when
he
was
gone
barbara
joined
her
father
and
the
engineer
on
the
porch
here
they
are
she
said
have
i
kept
them
nicely
for
you
she
was
holding
toward
the
seer
a
box
of
cigars
indeed
you
have
returned
the
engineer
in
a
pleased
tone
helping
himself
to
a
cool
moist
havana
you
are
a
dear
good
girl
jefferson
worth
did
not
use
tobacco
but
it
was
an
unwritten
law
of
the
household
that
the
seer
when
he
came
should
always
have
his
evening
smoke
on
the
porch
and
that
barbara
should
be
the
keeper
of
supplies
she
liked
to
see
her
friend
strong
face
brought
suddenly
out
of
the
dusk
by
the
flare
of
the
match
and
to
watch
the
glow
of
the
cigar
end
in
the
dark
while
they
talked
and
what
do
you
think
of
your
brother
abe
barbara
the
big
engineer
asked
when
his
cigar
was
going
nicely
did
he
talk
you
nearly
to
death
the
girl
laughed
i
guess
he
did
have
a
chance
i
always
do
most
of
the
talking
you
know
the
seer
chuckled
abe
told
me
once
that
most
of
the
time
he
felt
like
an
oyster
and
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
so
mad
at
himself
for
being
an
oyster
that
he
could
find
words
to
do
the
subject
justice
i
think
he
is
splendid
retorted
barbara
enthusiastically
he
is
returned
the
engineer
earnestly
i
do
know
of
a
man
in
the
profession
whom
i
would
rely
upon
so
wholly
in
work
of
a
certain
kind
you
see
abe
was
born
and
raised
in
the
wild
uncivilized
parts
of
the
country
and
he
has
a
natural
ability
for
his
work
that
amounts
almost
to
genius
with
a
knowledge
of
nature
gained
through
his
remarkable
powers
of
observation
and
deduction
i
doubt
if
abe
lee
has
an
equal
as
what
might
be
called
a
scout
i
believe
he
is
made
of
iron
hunger
cold
thirst
heat
wet
seem
to
make
no
impression
on
him
he
can
outlast
and
any
man
i
ever
met
he
has
the
instinct
of
a
wild
animal
for
finding
his
way
and
the
coldest
nerve
i
ever
saw
his
honesty
and
loyalty
amount
almost
to
fanaticism
but
he
is
diffident
and
shy
as
a
school
girl
and
as
sensitive
as
a
bashful
boy
i
verily
believe
he
knows
more
about
the
great
engineering
projects
in
the
west
than
of
the
school
men
but
i
seen
him
sit
for
an
hour
absolutely
dumb
half
scared
to
death
listening
to
the
cheap
twaddle
of
some
smart
with
the
ink
not
dry
yet
on
their
diplomas
put
him
in
the
field
in
charge
of
a
party
of
that
same
bunch
though
and
he
would
be
boss
to
the
last
stake
on
the
line
or
the
last
bite
of
grub
in
the
outfit
if
he
had
to
kill
half
of
them
to
do
it
i
guess
you
think
i
a
bit
enthusiastic
about
my
right
hand
man
he
finished
with
a
short
apologetic
laugh
and
i
am
it
because
i
know
him
he
struck
another
match
and
barbara
saw
his
face
for
an
instant
as
the
match
went
out
she
drew
a
long
breath
i
glad
you
said
that
she
said
softly
i
wanted
you
to
i
sure
he
has
earned
it
then
they
talked
of
the
seer
new
expedition
that
would
start
south
at
daybreak
and
it
seemed
to
barbara
that
the
very
air
was
electric
with
the
coming
of
a
mighty
age
when
the
race
would
direct
its
strength
to
the
turning
of
millions
of
acres
of
desolate
barren
waste
into
productive
farms
and
beautiful
homes
for
the
people
at
daybreak
the
girl
was
up
to
tell
the
seer
i
wish
she
said
wistfully
as
she
stood
with
him
a
moment
at
the
gate
i
wish
it
was
desert
that
you
and
abe
were
going
to
survey
the
engineer
smilingly
answered
some
day
perhaps
that
too
will
come
i
know
it
will
she
said
simply
and
as
she
stood
before
him
in
all
the
beautiful
strength
of
her
young
womanhood
the
seer
felt
that
sweet
mysterious
power
of
her
personality
felt
it
with
a
father
loving
pride
i
believe
you
do
know
barbara
he
said
i
believe
you
do
chapter
what
the
indian
told
the
seer
in
the
making
of
barbara
desert
the
river
did
not
count
the
centuries
of
its
labor
the
waves
did
not
number
the
ages
of
their
toil
the
burning
constant
sun
and
the
drying
drifting
winds
were
not
careful
for
the
years
therefore
is
the
time
of
the
real
beginning
of
what
happened
in
this
the
land
of
my
story
unknown
somewhere
in
the
eternity
that
lies
back
of
all
the
yesterdays
the
great
river
found
the
salt
waves
of
the
ocean
fathoms
deep
in
what
is
now
the
king
basin
and
extending
a
hundred
and
seventy
miles
north
of
the
shore
that
takes
their
wash
slowly
through
the
centuries
of
that
age
of
all
beginnings
the
river
cutting
canyons
and
valleys
in
the
north
and
carrying
southward
its
load
of
silt
built
from
the
east
across
the
gulf
to
lone
mountain
a
mighty
delta
dam
south
of
this
new
land
the
ocean
still
received
the
river
to
the
north
the
gulf
became
an
inland
sea
the
upper
edge
of
this
sea
beat
helpless
against
a
line
of
low
barren
hills
beyond
which
lay
many
miles
of
a
rainless
land
eastward
lay
yet
more
miles
of
desolate
waste
and
between
this
sea
and
the
parent
ocean
on
the
west
extending
southward
past
the
delta
dam
the
mountains
of
the
coast
range
shut
out
every
cloud
and
turned
back
every
stream
thus
trapped
and
helpless
the
bright
waters
with
all
their
life
fell
under
the
constant
fierce
beating
rays
of
the
sun
and
shrank
from
the
wearing
sweep
of
the
dry
tireless
winds
uncounted
still
the
centuries
of
that
age
also
passed
and
the
bottom
of
that
sea
lay
bare
dry
and
lifeless
under
the
burning
sky
still
beaten
by
the
pitiless
sun
still
swept
by
the
scorching
winds
the
place
that
had
held
the
glad
waters
with
their
teeming
life
came
to
be
an
empty
basin
of
blinding
sand
of
quivering
heat
of
dreadful
death
unheeding
the
ruin
it
had
wrought
the
river
swept
on
its
way
and
so
hemmed
in
by
mountain
wall
barren
hills
and
rainless
plains
forgotten
by
the
ocean
deserted
by
the
river
that
thirsty
land
lay
the
loneliest
most
desolate
bit
of
this
great
western
continent
but
the
river
could
not
work
this
ruin
without
contributing
to
the
desert
the
rich
strength
it
had
gathered
from
its
tributary
lands
mingled
with
the
sand
of
the
ancient
was
the
silt
from
faraway
mountain
and
hill
and
plain
that
basin
of
death
was
more
than
a
dusty
tomb
of
a
life
that
had
been
it
was
a
sepulchre
that
held
the
vast
treasure
of
a
life
that
would
be
would
be
when
the
ages
should
have
made
also
the
master
men
who
would
dare
say
to
the
river
make
restitution
men
who
could
with
power
command
the
rich
life
within
the
tomb
to
come
forth
but
master
men
are
not
the
product
of
years
scarcely
indeed
of
centuries
the
people
of
my
story
have
also
their
true
beginnings
in
ages
too
remote
to
be
reckoned
the
master
passions
the
governing
instincts
the
leading
desires
and
the
driving
fears
that
hew
and
carve
and
form
and
fashion
the
race
are
as
reckless
of
the
years
as
are
wave
and
river
and
sun
and
wind
therefore
the
forgotten
land
held
its
wealth
until
time
should
make
the
giants
that
could
take
it
in
the
centuries
of
those
forgotten
ages
that
went
into
the
making
of
the
king
basin
desert
the
families
of
men
grew
slowly
into
tribes
the
tribes
grew
slowly
into
nations
and
the
nations
grew
slowly
into
worlds
new
worlds
became
old
and
other
new
worlds
were
discovered
explored
developed
and
made
old
war
and
famine
and
pestilence
and
prosperity
hewed
and
formed
carved
and
built
and
fashioned
even
as
wave
and
river
and
sun
and
wind
the
kingdoms
of
earth
air
and
water
yielded
up
their
wealth
as
men
grew
strong
to
take
it
the
elements
bowed
their
necks
to
his
yoke
to
fetch
and
carry
for
him
as
he
grew
wise
to
order
the
wilderness
fled
the
mountains
lay
bare
their
hearts
the
waste
places
paid
tribute
as
he
grew
brave
to
command
across
the
wide
continent
the
tracks
of
its
wild
life
were
trodden
out
by
the
broad
cattle
trails
the
paths
of
the
herds
were
marked
by
the
wheels
of
immigrant
wagons
and
the
roads
of
the
teams
became
swift
highways
of
steel
in
the
east
the
great
cities
that
received
the
hordes
from
every
land
were
growing
ever
greater
on
the
far
west
coast
the
crowded
multitude
was
building
even
as
it
was
building
in
the
east
in
the
southwest
savage
race
succeeded
savage
race
until
at
last
the
padres
overtook
the
indian
and
the
rude
civilization
made
possible
by
the
priests
in
turn
ran
down
the
priest
about
the
land
of
my
story
forgotten
under
the
dry
sky
this
tide
of
life
swirled
and
and
eddied
but
touched
it
not
on
the
west
it
swept
even
to
the
foot
of
the
grim
mountain
wall
on
the
east
one
ripple
reached
even
to
the
river
when
rubio
city
was
born
but
the
desert
waited
silent
and
hot
and
fierce
in
its
desolation
holding
its
treasures
under
the
seal
of
death
against
the
coming
of
the
strong
ones
waited
until
the
forces
that
wrought
through
those
long
ages
should
have
done
also
their
work
waited
for
this
age
for
your
age
and
mine
for
the
age
of
the
seer
and
his
companions
for
the
days
of
my
story
the
days
of
barbara
and
her
friends
the
seer
expedition
returning
from
the
south
made
camp
on
the
bank
of
the
rio
colorado
twenty
miles
below
rubio
city
it
was
the
last
night
out
supper
was
over
and
the
men
with
their
pipes
and
cigarettes
settled
themselves
in
various
careless
attitudes
of
repose
after
the
long
day
their
faces
toughened
figures
and
worn
clothing
testified
to
their
weeks
of
toil
in
the
open
air
under
the
dry
sky
of
an
almost
rainless
land
some
were
veterans
of
many
a
similar
campaign
two
were
new
recruits
on
their
first
trip
all
were
strong
vigorous
specimens
of
intelligent
healthy
manhood
for
in
all
the
professions
not
excepting
the
army
and
navy
there
can
be
found
no
finer
body
of
men
than
our
civil
engineers
easily
they
fell
to
talking
of
night
in
rubio
city
of
baths
and
barbers
and
good
beds
and
clean
clothes
and
dinners
and
the
pleasures
of
civilization
and
prospective
future
jobs
much
chaff
was
passed
with
hearty
give
and
take
jokes
that
had
become
in
the
many
days
and
nights
that
the
party
had
been
cut
off
from
all
other
society
were
revived
with
fresh
interest
incidents
and
accidents
of
the
trip
were
related
and
reviewed
with
zest
with
here
and
there
a
comment
on
the
work
itself
that
was
still
fresh
in
their
minds
abe
lee
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
and
his
long
legs
stretched
straight
out
in
front
listened
enjoying
it
all
in
his
own
way
taking
his
share
of
the
chaff
with
a
slow
smile
exhaling
great
clouds
of
cigarette
smoke
and
only
at
rare
intervals
contributing
a
word
or
a
short
sentence
to
the
talk
abe
was
at
home
with
these
men
out
there
in
the
desert
night
under
the
chief
he
was
their
master
respected
admired
and
loved
but
the
knew
that
in
town
with
these
same
men
dressed
in
conventional
garb
on
the
street
or
in
the
hotel
the
surveyor
would
be
as
bashful
and
awkward
as
a
country
boy
so
they
joked
him
about
his
numerous
sweethearts
in
rubio
city
and
related
many
entirely
fictitious
love
adventures
and
romantic
experiences
that
he
was
said
to
have
passed
through
in
different
parts
of
the
country
during
the
years
they
had
known
him
not
one
of
them
but
would
have
been
astonished
beyond
words
had
he
known
of
abe
adventure
the
afternoon
before
they
left
rubio
city
and
how
through
every
day
of
the
hard
grilling
labor
with
the
expedition
the
image
of
the
girl
he
had
watched
through
his
field
glass
was
before
him
when
the
fire
of
the
wits
was
turned
on
another
mark
abe
slowly
arose
to
his
feet
and
slipped
out
of
the
circle
going
quietly
to
the
where
the
chinaman
sat
smoking
in
solitary
grandeur
he
asked
wing
where
is
the
chief
i
saw
him
talking
to
you
a
little
while
ago
me
no
sabe
boss
abe
chief
him
go
off
that
way
he
pointed
toward
the
river
with
his
long
bamboo
pipe
wing
sabe
chief
feel
velly
bad
boss
abe
damn
the
white
man
regarded
the
chinaman
silently
for
a
moment
then
you
a
good
boy
wing
good
night
night
boss
abe
came
the
plaintive
answer
and
the
surveyor
went
on
to
where
a
group
of
cocopah
indian
laborers
made
their
rude
camp
these
he
greeted
in
spanish
and
asked
has
the
chief
been
with
you
since
supper
no
senor
he
by
river
there
little
time
past
said
one
pointing
to
a
clump
of
cottonwood
trees
that
rose
above
a
fringe
of
willows
buenos
noches
hombres
said
abe
buenos
noches
senor
came
the
chorus
of
soft
voices
in
the
dusk
on
the
high
bank
under
the
cottonwoods
the
seer
sat
with
bowed
head
he
did
not
heed
the
broad
yellow
tide
of
water
that
swept
by
him
so
silently
he
did
not
see
the
myriad
stars
in
the
velvet
sky
nor
notice
the
golden
moon
climbing
slowly
up
from
the
dark
level
of
the
land
the
jovial
voices
and
merry
laughter
of
his
men
came
to
him
from
the
camp
but
he
did
not
hear
the
expedition
would
be
over
the
party
disbanded
he
would
make
his
report
to
the
capitalists
who
had
sent
him
forth
his
report
the
seer
groaned
few
words
would
be
needed
to
sum
up
the
work
of
the
last
two
months
but
it
would
not
be
easy
to
frame
them
his
ear
caught
the
snap
of
a
twig
and
a
whiff
of
cigarette
smoke
floated
to
him
he
turned
his
head
quickly
that
you
abe
the
long
figure
of
the
surveyor
settled
on
the
bank
by
his
side
for
a
little
neither
spoke
while
the
seer
with
slow
care
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
well
lad
he
said
at
last
we
have
about
reached
the
end
of
another
failure
will
you
go
to
new
york
sir
no
it
will
not
be
necessary
i
can
write
in
fifty
words
all
there
is
to
say
perhaps
they
will
send
you
out
again
offered
the
surveyor
their
interest
is
not
strong
enough
they
only
tackled
this
because
some
other
fellows
were
considering
the
proposition
that
made
them
think
there
might
be
something
in
it
if
i
had
the
capital
to
make
surveys
and
could
go
to
them
with
data
for
some
other
project
they
might
consider
it
but
abe
rolled
another
cigarette
and
with
the
first
cloud
of
smoke
came
the
slow
words
well
then
let
get
the
data
even
at
what
seemed
a
hopeless
suggestion
the
discouraged
heart
of
the
old
engineer
beat
more
quickly
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
younger
man
where
abe
stretched
forth
a
long
arm
toward
the
broad
colorado
at
their
feet
and
toward
the
desert
beyond
the
king
basin
you
often
told
me
about
that
country
if
i
sabe
the
lay
of
the
land
we
somewhere
at
the
southern
end
of
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
high
ground
of
the
delta
that
shuts
out
the
ocean
there
water
enough
here
for
five
times
that
territory
do
you
mean
the
seer
began
quickly
and
stopped
i
mean
this
you
already
know
the
north
and
northeastern
part
of
the
basin
from
the
railroad
you
have
been
through
it
from
the
west
on
the
san
felipe
trail
send
the
outfit
in
with
the
boys
give
them
orders
on
the
bank
for
their
pay
and
let
them
go
you
and
i
can
scout
around
the
delta
end
of
that
country
over
there
for
a
week
or
two
and
if
it
looks
good
with
what
you
have
already
seen
you
have
enough
to
talk
on
then
go
on
to
new
york
and
when
you
report
on
the
southern
project
turn
loose
on
with
this
abe
said
the
engineer
thoughtfully
if
anyone
but
you
were
to
propose
that
i
go
before
these
capitalists
to
interest
them
in
a
project
without
ever
having
put
an
instrument
on
it
i
would
knock
him
down
such
recklessness
would
ruin
any
civil
engineer
in
the
world
if
if
he
guessed
wrong
finished
abe
dryly
if
he
guessed
wrong
admitted
the
seer
reluctantly
if
it
looked
good
enough
for
you
to
risk
an
opinion
you
would
have
some
strong
talking
points
ventured
abe
there
must
be
five
hundred
thousand
acres
in
that
old
the
colorado
carries
water
enough
for
five
times
that
area
there
the
railroad
already
built
along
one
side
there
san
felipe
and
the
whole
coast
country
within
easy
reach
it
beats
the
other
proposition
a
hundred
to
one
if
it
can
be
done
at
all
the
seer
rose
and
paced
up
and
down
in
the
bright
moonlight
presently
he
said
if
you
accept
the
position
with
hunt
up
north
you
should
go
on
at
once
that
job
would
be
the
best
thing
you
ever
had
do
you
want
to
take
it
you
know
what
i
want
if
you
can
use
me
i
could
manage
your
present
salary
for
this
trip
but
beyond
that
you
know
how
uncertain
it
all
is
hunt
ca
wait
any
longer
look
here
said
abe
angrily
i
understood
when
i
made
my
proposition
that
our
salaries
would
stop
when
we
cut
the
outfit
do
you
think
i
meant
for
you
to
take
all
the
risk
i
only
a
surveyor
and
you
an
educated
engineer
but
this
thing
means
as
much
to
me
as
it
does
to
you
let
me
share
the
expense
and
i
with
you
but
not
on
any
other
terms
hunt
and
his
job
can
go
hang
i
do
see
why
you
should
assume
that
it
only
my
pay
that
i
work
for
it
was
a
long
speech
for
abe
the
engineer
put
his
big
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
thank
you
abe
he
said
that
does
me
good
i
always
known
that
it
was
there
but
it
a
hard
road
lad
a
mighty
hard
road
then
i
wonder
if
we
have
an
indian
in
the
outfit
who
knows
this
country
yes
sir
abe
answered
promptly
jose
knows
it
well
i
been
pumping
him
for
a
month
i
get
him
as
the
tall
figure
of
the
surveyor
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
oocopah
camp
the
seer
smiled
to
himself
been
pumping
him
for
a
month
he
repeated
that
means
that
he
saw
almost
before
i
did
that
the
other
proposition
was
no
good
humph
he
faced
toward
the
river
and
looked
away
into
the
night
where
the
king
basin
lay
a
weird
under
the
light
of
the
moon
and
because
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
barbara
desert
without
thinking
of
barbara
he
smiled
again
musing
that
there
would
be
little
sleep
that
night
for
the
girl
in
rubio
city
if
she
knew
what
he
and
abe
were
considering
from
across
the
river
came
the
shrill
snarling
yelping
coyote
chorus
and
the
engineer
saw
again
the
body
of
a
dead
woman
at
the
dry
water
hole
an
empty
canteen
and
a
baby
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
while
the
seer
was
too
careful
an
engineer
to
take
quickly
the
suggestion
of
abe
he
had
seen
too
many
tests
of
the
surveyor
genius
not
to
consider
his
proposition
seriously
he
was
also
too
much
of
a
dreamer
not
to
be
influenced
by
thoughts
of
barbara
and
her
association
in
his
mind
with
this
particular
project
could
it
be
that
the
land
which
had
so
tragically
given
the
child
into
his
life
was
now
to
realize
his
dreams
of
reclamation
he
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
abe
who
was
followed
by
an
old
cocopah
tell
the
chief
what
you
have
told
me
jose
said
the
surveyor
and
stepping
aside
he
rolled
the
inevitable
cigarette
with
an
air
of
taking
himself
wholly
out
of
the
matter
under
consideration
you
sabe
that
country
over
there
jose
asked
the
chief
si
senor
came
the
soft
answer
and
reaching
out
the
indian
gently
turned
the
engineer
so
that
the
latter
stood
with
his
back
squarely
to
the
river
taking
the
seer
right
hand
and
holding
it
outstretched
with
open
palm
upward
in
one
of
his
own
and
tracing
with
the
other
finger
as
one
might
trace
on
a
relief
map
he
continued
in
spanish
as
he
drew
his
finger
carefully
along
the
white
man
thumb
from
the
wrist
here
are
the
mountains
that
shut
out
the
country
by
the
big
sea
where
is
san
felipe
i
go
there
once
long
time
ago
my
people
live
there
he
indicated
the
space
between
the
first
and
second
joints
of
the
thumb
next
he
touched
the
base
of
the
seer
little
finger
here
is
rubio
city
then
tracing
the
outer
rim
of
the
palm
toward
the
wrist
here
are
the
hills
and
the
railroad
that
the
senor
made
his
finger
paused
in
the
depression
between
the
base
of
the
thumb
and
the
outer
edge
of
the
palm
at
the
wrist
the
railroad
goes
through
the
pass
in
the
high
mountains
here
next
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
hand
he
traced
across
the
palm
at
the
base
of
the
fingers
the
river
goes
this
way
to
the
big
water
that
comes
in
from
the
sea
here
he
indicated
the
open
space
between
the
extended
thumb
and
the
inner
edge
of
the
palm
we
stand
now
here
he
touched
the
base
of
the
seer
index
finger
it
is
the
hollow
of
god
hand
senor
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
he
repeated
reverently
he
dropped
the
engineer
hand
and
stood
quietly
waiting
to
be
questioned
again
the
seer
put
forth
his
hand
and
pointing
with
his
own
finger
to
the
inner
edge
of
the
palm
between
the
base
of
the
index
finger
and
the
thumb
he
asked
the
land
is
high
here
si
senor
a
little
just
like
the
hand
it
is
much
low
here
he
touched
the
deepest
part
of
the
palm
and
a
little
high
here
where
we
stand
sometimes
when
much
water
comes
the
river
goes
all
over
here
he
indicated
the
extreme
inner
edge
of
the
palm
most
always
this
water
go
all
this
way
toward
the
open
space
between
the
thumb
and
palm
sometimes
a
little
goes
here
he
traced
the
lines
that
cross
the
palm
towards
the
wrist
you
can
show
us
this
country
si
senor
how
long
will
it
take
what
you
like
from
here
to

left
from
the

last

come
the
chief
looked
at
the
silent
abe
then
back
to
the
old
indian
all
right
jose
we
go
in
the
morning
you
senor
lee
and
i
be
ready
si
senor
buenos
noches
senores
good
night
good
night
returned
the
two
white
men
there
was
much
conjecturing
among
the
surprised
surveyors
next
morning
when
the
chief
gave
to
each
man
his
pay
check
and
placed
an
in
charge
with
instructions
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
outfit
when
they
should
arrive
in
rubio
city
two
loaded
and
three
saddle
ponies
were
ready
when
the
seer
had
finished
his
business
with
the
men
were
spoken
all
around
and
the
seer
and
abe
with
jose
in
the
lead
turned
back
toward
the
south
looks
like
they
had
forgotten
something
said
one
of
the
recruits
as
the
group
stood
watching
the
little
party
jog
steadily
into
the
distance
apparently
retracing
the
tracks
the
expedition
had
made
the
day
before
sonny
remarked
the
veteran
left
in
charge
what
one
of
that
pair
forgets
the
other
is
dead
sure
to
remember
all
the
signs
say
that
they
makin
big
medicine
all
we
have
to
do
with
it
is
to
push
for
rubio
city
pronto
and
cash
our
pay
checks
lord
but
would
i
like
to
be
in
it
he
added
regretfully
as
he
turned
away
with
provisions
for
three
weeks
on
the
and
the
assurance
of
jose
that
there
was
feed
and
water
in
the
overflow
lands
for
the
horses
the
seer
and
abe
proposed
to
cover
most
of
the
territory
lying
between
the
rio
colorado
and
lone
mountain
it
was
here
that
the
great
river
in
the
ages
long
past
had
built
the
delta
dam
thus
cutting
off
the
northern
end
of
the
gulf
that
was
now
the
king
basin
desert
it
was
their
plan
to
follow
this
high
land
that
separated
the
ocean
from
the
basin
to
the
mountains
then
to
work
back
as
far
out
in
the
basin
from
water
and
feed
as
they
could
they
would
then
follow
the
river
on
the
basin
side
to
rubio
city
they
had
barely
passed
beyond
sight
of
the
main
party
when
jose
turned
directly
toward
the
river
at
that
stage
of
water
a
long
bar
put
out
into
the
stream
and
from
its
point
the
current
set
strongly
toward
the
opposite
bank
here
we
cross
said
the
indian
briefly
constructing
a
rude
raft
for
their
supplies
and
swimming
the
animals
they
reached
the
other
shore
some
distance
below
the
point
of
launching
with
no
accident
and
that
night
camped
well
back
from
the
river
on
the
delta
land
day
after
day
they
rode
from
sunrise
until
dark
studying
the
land
estimating
distances
and
grades
observing
the
courses
of
the
channels
cut
by
the
overflow
and
the
marks
of
high
water
noting
the
character
of
the
soil
and
the
vegetation
sometimes
together
sometimes
separated
with
jose
to
select
their
camping
places
and
to
help
them
with
his
indian
knowledge
of
the
country
and
always
at
night
after
the
long
hard
day
when
supper
cooked
by
their
own
hands
was
over
with
pipe
and
cigarettes
they
reviewed
their
observations
and
compared
notes
summing
up
the
results
before
rolling
in
their
blankets
to
sleep
under
the
stars
some
day
perhaps
when
the
world
is
much
older
and
very
much
wiser
civilization
will
erect
a
proper
monument
to
the
memory
of
such
men
as
these
but
just
now
civilization
is
too
greedily
quarreling
over
its
newly
acquired
wealth
to
acknowledge
its
debt
of
honor
to
those
who
made
this
wealth
possible
but
the
seer
and
his
companion
concerned
themselves
with
no
such
thoughts
as
these
they
thought
only
of
the
possibility
of
converting
the
thousands
of
acres
of
the
king
basin
desert
into
productive
farms
for
this
they
conceived
to
be
their
work
they
had
worked
across
the
basin
to
lone
mountain
and
back
to
the
river
to
a
point
nearly
opposite
the
clump
of
cotton
woods
where
they
had
left
the
expedition
night
they
would
be
in
rubio
city
abe
said
the
seer
our
intake
would
go
in
right
here
we
could
follow
the
old
channel
of
dry
river
with
our
canal
about
twenty
miles
out
put
in
a
heading
and
lead
off
our
mains
and
laterals
for
two
or
three
hours
they
discussed
plans
and
estimates
then
the
engineer
shut
his
with
a
snap
if
those
new
yorkers
listen
to
what
i
can
tell
them
of
this
country
now
they
a
whole
lot
slower
than
i
take
them
to
be
then
you
think
you
will
make
a
guess
on
the
proposition
asked
abe
slyly
the
seer
laughed
like
a
boy
i
start
for
new
york
night
he
answered
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
they
struck
the
san
felipe
trail
a
few
miles
from
rubio
city
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
that
old
road
with
its
memories
for
the
seer
and
his
companion
that
led
the
engineer
to
say
it
curious
abe
but
i
ca
shake
off
the
odd
feeling
that
barbara
life
is
somehow
wrapped
up
in
that
country
out
there
as
he
spoke
he
turned
in
his
saddle
to
look
back
toward
the
basin
she
seems
to
belong
to
it
somehow
as
in
a
way
it
belongs
to
her
there
is
a
look
in
her
eyes
sometimes
that
makes
me
think
of
the
desert
and
the
desert
always
reminds
me
of
her
i
know
one
thing
he
finished
with
a
short
laugh
if
i
was
to
let
out
some
of
the
fancies
that
have
come
to
me
in
this
connection
it
would
ruin
me
forever
so
far
as
my
profession
goes
abe
made
no
reply
possibly
because
he
also
had
fancies
fancies
that
he
could
not
tell
even
to
the
seer
it
is
astonishing
what
a
great
cloud
of
dust
five
animals
can
stir
up
on
a
desert
trail
as
the
little
outfit
jogged
slowly
along
the
great
yellow
mass
rolled
up
into
the
air
high
above
their
heads
and
hung
a
long
streamer
above
the
trail
until
it
vanished
in
the
distance
barbara
who
was
riding
out
from
town
on
the
mesa
saw
that
cloud
and
stopped
to
study
it
intently
for
a
few
moments
as
if
debating
some
question
then
touching
her
animal
with
the
spur
she
set
off
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
approaching
horsemen
while
the
two
men
watched
the
dust
that
arose
from
the
single
horse
feet
with
the
interest
that
travelers
in
lonely
lands
always
feel
in
any
life
that
chances
to
come
their
way
abe
that
a
woman
exclaimed
the
seer
after
a
time
abe
said
nothing
he
had
discovered
that
interesting
fact
some
moments
before
the
engineer
rose
in
his
stirrups
abe
i
bet
a
month
salary
barbara
i
not
gambling
returned
the
other
smiling
at
his
excitement
i
know
it
is
the
big
engineer
dropped
into
his
saddle
with
a
grunt
of
disgust
young
man
you
got
eyes
like
a
buzzard
he
said
twisting
about
to
face
his
companion
by
all
traditions
i
suppose
i
should
say
but
you
certainly
do
look
much
like
that
noble
king
of
birds
carrying
dirt
enough
to
bury
a
horse
the
seer
took
off
his
sombrero
and
began
beating
the
dust
from
his
own
shoulders
while
the
surveyor
looked
on
in
silent
amusement
she
think
by
the
dust
you
that
there
some
kind
of
a
scrap
goin
on
and
that
she
better
head
the
other
way
not
much
she
would
head
the
other
way
from
a
scrap
she
would
come
on
all
the
faster
i
thought
you
knew
barbara
better
than
that
he
replaced
his
hat
why
abe
one
time
when
she
was
the
surveyor
interrupted
his
chief
by
standing
up
in
his
stirrups
in
turn
and
swinging
his
hat
in
greeting
while
the
seer
in
waving
his
own
sombrero
and
whooping
like
a
wild
man
forgot
what
he
was
about
to
relate
the
girl
came
on
at
a
run
and
guiding
her
horse
between
the
two
men
held
out
a
hand
to
each
chapter
vi
the
standard
of
the
west
three
days
after
the
seer
letters
to
abe
and
barbara
telling
them
that
james
greenfield
and
his
associates
would
finance
an
expedition
to
make
the
preliminary
surveys
in
the
king
basin
desert
the
overland
dropped
a
passenger
in
rubio
city
from
new
york
the
stranger
was
really
a
fine
looking
young
man
with
the
appearance
of
being
exceptionally
and
indeed
the
most
casual
of
observers
would
not
have
hesitated
to
pronounce
him
a
thoroughbred
and
a
good
individual
of
the
best
type
that
the
race
has
produced
a
company
of
men
and
women
traveling
acquaintances
evidently
followed
him
from
the
pullman
to
bid
him
and
to
look
at
the
indians
who
with
their
wealth
of
curios
spread
before
them
squatted
in
a
long
row
beside
the
track
objects
of
never
failing
interest
to
travelers
from
the
east
ugh
said
a
tall
blonde
who
displayed
more
bracelets
bangles
chains
and
charms
both
natural
and
manufactured
than
any
blanketed
squaw
in
the
party
of
natives
i
suppose
if
we
ever
see
you
again
you
be
the
color
of
that
thing
there
she
pointed
to
a
smoky
papago
in
a
green
and
decorated
shirt
who
posed
in
a
watchful
attitude
near
his
thrifty
how
perfectly
romantic
gushed
a
billowy
divorcee
clinging
to
the
young
fellow
athletic
arm
with
little
shivers
of
delight
to
think
of
you
in
this
great
savage
wild
land
among
these
strange
people
are
you
just
a
little
bit
frightened
by
george
i
half
wish
i
was
going
to
stop
with
you
you
get
some
great
shooting
do
you
know
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
while
the
chorus
joined
in
you
die
of
loneliness
you
find
nothing
fit
to
eat
and
do
take
care
of
yourself
then
as
the
warning
all
aboard
and
the
clang
of
the
engine
bell
came
down
the
platform
there
were
quick
and
a
rush
for
the
car
the
colored
porters
tossed
their
steps
aboard
and
followed
smoothly
the
long
coaches
slid
past
there
was
a
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
caps
from
the
rear
of
the
observation
car
and
the
young
man
turned
to
look
curiously
about
hotel
the
stranger
glanced
doubtfully
at
the
citizen
who
reached
for
his
suit
case
and
without
replying
stepped
into
the
questionable
looking
hack
standing
nearby
the
driver
threw
the
suitcase
into
the
vehicle
after
his
passenger
and
climbing
to
his
seat
yelled
to
the
team
there
was
no
rush
of
to
meet
the
guest
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
room
was
with
a
group
strange
to
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
from
new
york
men
in
flannel
shirts
and
belted
trousers
talked
to
men
in
more
conventional
business
clothes
others
in
their
shirt
sleeves
sat
smoking
with
companions
in
blue
overalls
two
or
three
wore
guns
loosely
belted
at
their
hips
here
and
there
was
the
tied
and
tailored
tourist
in
the
corner
near
the
big
window
a
group
of
women
some
in
white
duck
some
in
khaki
or
corduroy
sat
chatting
and
enjoying
the
scene
no
one
paid
the
least
attention
to
the
newcomer
the
driver
of
the
hack
dropped
the
suit
case
near
the
desk
with
a
bang
and
turned
to
reply
to
a
remark
addressed
to
him
by
a
jovial
man
standing
near
only
the
clerk
regarded
the
stranger
have
you
a
room
with
bath
the
clerk
smiled
certainly
sir
then
to
a
young
fellow
talking
over
the
cigar
counter
to
a
man
in
boots
and
spurs
jack
show
this
gentleman
to
in
the
room
the
guide
threw
open
long
french
windows
and
pointed
to
a
cot
on
the
outside
better
sleep
on
the
porch
he
volunteered
sleep
on
the
porch
suit
yourself
came
the
answer
as
the
independent
one
turned
away
look
here
the
employe
of
the
house
paused
i
want
my
trunk
sent
up
immediately
sure
mike
let
have
your
checks
the
stranger
stood
staring
at
the
door
which
the
breezy
young
man
as
he
disappeared
with
a
cheery
whistle
had
shut
behind
him
with
a
vigorous
bang
in
the
dining
room
the
man
from
new
york
found
the
same
easy
freedom
in
the
manner
of
dress
the
same
lack
of
conventionalities
and
the
same
atmosphere
of
general
yet
he
could
not
say
that
there
was
any
lack
of
real
courtesy
and
certainly
there
was
no
rude
and
boisterous
talk
it
was
to
say
the
least
unsettling
to
the
exceptionally
and
stranger
accustomed
to
the
hotels
and
restaurants
in
the
east
frequented
by
his
class
early
that
evening
the
easterner
sallied
forth
clearly
bent
on
he
had
dressed
for
the
occasion
the
gray
traveling
suit
had
been
put
aside
for
a
outfit
of
corduroy
the
coat
worn
without
a
vest
over
a
fine
negligee
shirt
of
silk
was
norfolk
the
trousers
were
riding
trousers
and
above
the
tan
shoes
were
puttees
all
this
with
the
light
soft
hat
neat
tie
and
the
undeniably
fine
figure
and
handsome
face
would
have
made
him
attractive
on
any
stage
the
tourists
turned
to
look
after
him
with
expressions
of
admiring
envy
the
natives
white
red
black
yellow
and
brown
accepted
him
with
no
more
than
a
passing
glance
as
a
part
of
the
strange
new
life
that
the
railroad
was
constantly
bringing
to
rubio
city
calmly
conscious
of
himself
and
openly
interested
in
a
mildly
condescending
way
the
young
man
strolled
down
one
side
of
the
main
street
to
the
end
of
the
business
section
then
back
on
the
other
twice
he
made
the
round
then
seeking
scenes
of
further
interest
pushed
open
the
swinging
doors
of
rubio
city
most
popular
place
of
amusement
the
gold
bar
saloon
at
a
table
in
one
corner

with
unbuttoned

and
a
heavy
gun
loosely
buckled
about
his
slim
waist
the
other
heavy
were
holding
animated
conversation
over
their
glasses
that
is
to
say
the
thick
man
was
animated
glaring
at
his
companion
he
banged
his
huge
hairy
fist
on
the
table

the

lifted

and
with

with
simplicity
at

immaculate
figure
of
the
stranger

went
quietly
and
quickly
out
before
the
pugnacious
pat
could
voice
his
disgust
and
disappointment
at
the
disappearance
of
the
citizen
a
low
contemptuous
laugh
from
the
stranger
at
the
bar
drew
the
attention
of
the
two
friends
the
young
man
was
watching
them
with
an
amused
smile
texas
joe
and
the
irishman
regarded
each
other
thoughtfully
pard
said
tex
in
a
low
earnest
tone
do
you
reckon
that
there
hilarity
was
in
any
ways
directed
toward
this
corner
of
the
room
the
stranger
receiving
his
change
from
the
bartender
was
moving
leisurely
toward
the
door
when
his
way
was
barred
by
the
heavy
bulk
of
pat
there
was
no
misunderstanding
the
expression
on
the
features
of
the
irish
gladiator
eyeing
the
athletic
easterner
fiercely
he
growled
with
deliberate
meaning
ye

he
lifted
his
fists
and
the
stranger
without
giving
back
an
inch
or
exhibiting
the
slightest
suggestion
of
fear
but
rather
with
the
calm
of
a
trained
athlete
squared
himself
for
the
encounter
eagerly
the
patrons
of
the
place
miners
cowboys
ranchers
adventurers
mexicans
indians
had
gathered
around
the
two
men
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
what
promised
to
be
no
tame
exhibition
already
several
bets
had
been
placed
and
critical
estimates
and
comments
on
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
were
being
made
freely
when
a
hand
fell
on
pat
uplifted
arm
turning
with
an
oath
of
rage
at
the
interruption
the
irishman
faced
abe
lee

amusing
yourself
as
usual
to
the
angry
protests
from
the
crowd
the
tall
surveyor
gave
not
the
slightest
heed
for
a
moment
the
irishman
looking
up
into
that
thin
face
was
speechless
as
though
he
faced
some
apparition
then
with
a
yell
of
delight
he
caught
the
lank
form
of
the
seer
assistant
in
a
hug
for

passed
the
crowd
as

moved
by
a
single
impulse
separated
and
the
room
was
filled
with
loud
talk
and
laughter
glancing
around
pat
eye
met
the
still
defiant
look
of
the
stranger
who
had
not
moved
from
his
place
but
stood
calmly
watching
the
irishman
and
abe
as
if
waiting
the
pleasure
of
the
man
who
had
challenged
him
the
irishman
grinned
in
appreciation
howld
on
a

he
said
to
abe
who
was
moving
away
with

toward
a
vacant

to

tense

over

face
and
i

he
said
heartily
the
fact

not
laughing
at

but
at
the
way

two
men
called
the
bluff

he
eyed
the
athletic
limbs
deep
chest
broad
shoulders
and
head
with
eyes
that
twinkled
his
approval
some
day
but
niver
mind
now
come
he
led
the
way
to
the
table
as
they
seated
themselves
pat
regarded
the
surveyor
with
pleased
interest
well

a
most
unexpected
worrld

the

demanded

that

that
he
lost
down
the
shaft
at
gold
center
when
the
surveyor
had
explained
his
presence
in
rubio
city
and
texas
and
pat
had
agreed
to
join
the
king
basin
party
the
stranger
said
i
think
it
is
quite
time
now
that
i
introduce
myself
you
are
lee
i
believe
abe
assented
and
with
his
two
companions
regarded
him
with
interest
taking
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
the
surveyor
the
young
man
continued
i
am
a
civil
engineer
i
have
instructions
from
the
chief
to
report
to
you
my
name
is
willard
holmes
the
next
morning
the
young
engineer
from
the
east
presented
his
card
at
the
pioneer
bank
and
asked
for
worth
the
man
who
received
the
correctly
engraved
bit
of
pasteboard
merely
nodded
toward
the
other
end
of
the
long
partition
of
polished
wood
plate
glass
and
bronze
bars
you
find
him
back
there
mr
holmes
the
new
yorker
smiled
at
the
provincialism
but
sought
the
banker
without
further
ceremony
closing
the
door
with
one
hand
jefferson
worth
with
the
other
indicated
the
chair
at
the
end
of
his
desk
sit
down
you
have
a
letter
from
greenfield
relative
to
my
coming
asked
willard
holmes
the
banker
lifted
a
typewritten
sheet
from
his
desk
glanced
at
it
and
turned
back
to
his
visitor
yes
he
said
the
involuntary
movement
was
the
instinctive
act
of
one
who
habitually
verifies
every
statement
then
as
those
expressionless
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
stranger
face
the
engineer
sensation
was
as
though
from
behind
that
gray
mask
something
reached
out
to
grasp
his
innermost
thoughts
and
emotions
he
felt
strangely
transparent
and
exposed
as
one
alone
in
his
lighted
chamber
at
night
might
feel
someone
in
the
dark
without
watching
through
the
window
presently
the
colorless
exact
voice
of
jefferson
worth
asked
this
is
your
first
visit
west
yes
sir
my
work
has
been
altogether
in
new
york
and
the
new
england
states
five
years
with
the
new
york
contracting
and
construction
company
said
jefferson
worth
exactly
laying
his
hand
again
on
the
letter
on
his
desk
yes
for
the
past
two
years
i
have
had
charge
of
their
more
important
operations
the
engineer
tone
was
a
shade
impressive
but
there
was
not
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
hint
in
the
face
or
manner
of
that
man
in
the
revolving
chair
to
intimate
that
he
was
impressed
the
visitor
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
steel
door
of
the
big
safe
in
the
other
room
you
are
well
acquainted
with
greenfield
and
his
associates
my
father
and
greenfield
were
boyhood
friends
and
college
classmates
the
engineer
explained
since
the
death
of
my
father
when
i
was
a
little
chap
i
have
lived
with
uncle
jim
he
was
my
guardian
until
i
became
of
age
the
young
man
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
the
death
of
his
father
had
left
him
penniless
and
that
his
father
friend
who
had
never
married
had
reared
and
educated
the
child
of
his
old
classmate
as
his
own
son
neither
did
he
explain
that
his
rapid
advancement
in
his
profession
was
due
largely
to
the
powerful
influence
of
the
capitalist
and
those
closely
associated
with
him
together
with
the
strength
of
the
proud
social
position
to
which
he
was
born
rather
than
to
hard
work
and
experience
probably
willard
holmes
himself
did
not
realize
how
much
these
things
had
added
to
his
own
native
ability
and
technical
training
he
had
never
known
anything
else
but
these
things
and
he
accepted
them
as
unconsciously
as
his
voice
was
colored
with
the
accent
of
the
cultured
east
how
do
you
size
up
this
king
basin
proposition
questioned
the
banker
again
willard
holmes
smiled
at
the
western
man
words
sizing
up
and
proposition
were
pleasingly
novel
forms
of
expression
to
him
really
he
answered
i
have
gone
into
it
very
thoroughly
as
yet
greenfield
asked
me
to
come
out
because
he
and
his
associates
felt
he
paused
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
not
to
say
what
greenfield
and
his
associates
felt
that
with
my
experience
in
connection
with
large
corporations
i
could
be
of
value
to
them
in
certain
phases
of
the
work
he
finished
he
wondered
if
the
man
who
listened
with
such
an
air
of
carefully
considering
every
word
and
mentally
reaching
out
for
whatever
lay
back
of
the
verbal
expression
had
grasped
what
he
had
been
about
to
say
jefferson
worth
waited
and
holmes
continued
greenfield
and
his
friends
are
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
in
with
them
on
the
organization
of
this
company
worth
that
is
of
course
providing
the
scheme
proves
to
be
practicable
they
instructed
me
to
urge
you
personally
to
consider
their
proposal
favorably
and
to
ask
you
by
all
means
to
represent
them
on
this
expedition
if
possible
they
realize
that
a
man
of
your
recognized
ability
and
standing
in
the
financial
world
particularly
in
the
west
in
close
touch
as
you
are
with
capital
and
conditions
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
no
doubt
familiar
with
the
reclamation
work
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
their
strength
in
fact
i
may
say
they
would
depend
largely
upon
your
judgment
as
to
whether
the
scheme
was
practicable
from
a
business
standpoint
on
your
side
i
am
sure
you
recognize
the
advantage
of
allying
yourself
with
such
a
group
of
capitalists
who
are
strong
enough
to
finance
any
undertaking
no
matter
how
great
their
interests
are
already
enormous
as
you
know
they
operate
only
on
the
largest
scale
and
if
this
survey
justifies
the
report
already
made
they
will
make
a
big
thing
out
of
this
for
everyone
interested
the
cold
exact
voice
of
jefferson
worth
came
as
if
from
a
machine
incapable
of
inflection
i
have
written
greenfield
that
i
would
look
into
the
proposition
for
him
i
will
go
out
with
the
outfit
have
you
seen
abe
lee
i
met
him
last
night
and
we
had
a
little
talk
over
things
i
confess
i
was
a
little
surprised
why
well
that
he
is
in
charge
i
was
instructed
to
report
to
him
i
find
that
he
has
had
no
schooling
whatever
that
in
fact
he
is
nothing
but
a
kind
of
a
surveyor
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
a
good
practical
fellow
but
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
reckless
to
put
him
in
such
a
responsible
position
jefferson
worth
did
not
say
that
he
himself
had
had
no
more
schooling
than
the
seer
lieutenant
perhaps
that
also
was
not
necessary
to
explain
he
did
say
we
have
only
one
standard
in
the
west
mr
holmes
and
that
what
can
you
do
came
the
words
as
if
spoken
by
cold
iron
chapter
vii
do
you
like
my
desert
holmes
after
his
meal
willard
holmes
following
the
example
of
others
sought
the
shade
of
the
arcade
in
front
of
the
hotel
helping
himself
to
a
chair
and
moving
a
little
away
from
the
general
company
he
sat
enjoying
his
cigar
musing
on
the
novelty
of
his
surroundings
and
reviewing
his
impressions
of
the
last
few
hours
it
was
natural
that
he
should
make
comparisons
that
he
should
see
men
and
things
in
the
light
of
the
only
men
and
things
he
had
ever
known
abe
lee
he
measured
by
the
standing
of
his
own
engineering
friends
demanding
that
the
and
surveyor
exhibit
all
the
of
boston
he
might
as
consistently
have
demanded
that
the
flood
of
sunlight
that
fell
in
such
blinding
glory
upon
the
new
world
before
him
should
shine
as
through
the
city
atmosphere
of
new
york
one
was
no
more
impossible
than
the
other
jefferson
worth
he
compared
with
the
college
and
university
friends
of
his
father
with
greenfield
and
the
new
business
men
of
his
class
demanding
that
the
western
pioneer
banker
show
the
same
characteristics
that
distinguished
the
cultured
capitalists
whose
were
pioneers
rubio
city
he
saw
in
the
light
of
those
eastern
cities
that
were
founded
in
the
days
when
men
knew
not
that
there
was
any
world
west
of
the
alleghanies
turning
his
head
now
and
then
to
look
over
the
typical
groups
that
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
arcade
dressed
or
undressed
with
all
the
easy
freedom
of
a
land
too
young
as
yet
to
have
conventions
he
recalled
his
favorite
hotels
in
his
home
cities
and
smiled
to
think
what
would
happen
if
some
of
these
roughly
clad
individuals
were
to
appear
there
among
the
guests
he
did
not
know
yet
that
some
of
these
roughly
clad
individuals
were
as
much
at
home
in
those
same
favorite
hotels
as
was
he
himself
likewise
as
he
watched
the
passing
citizens
in
the
street
he
recalled
the
scene
from
the
windows
of
his
club
at
home
a
famous
club
on
a
famous
avenue
that
young
woman
for
instance
with
her
khaki
divided
skirt
wide
sombrero
fringed
gauntlets
and
the
big
western
saddle
coming
there
on
a
horse
whose
feet
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
ground
as
he
plunged
and
pranced
impatiently
along
springing
with
arched
neck
and
pointed
ears
at
every
object
that
could
possibly
be
made
into
something
frightful
by
his
playful
fancy
what
a
sensation
she
would
create
at
home
by
jove
but
she
could
ride
though
he
watched
with
admiring
eyes
the
strong
graceful
figure
that
sat
the
uncertain
horse
as
easily
and
unconsciously
as
any
one
of
his
women
friends
at
home
would
rest
in
a
comfortable
chair
as
the
horsewoman
drew
nearer
he
fell
to
wondering
what
she
was
like
could
she
talk
for
instance
of
anything
but
the
homely
details
of
her
own
rough
life
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
fancied
her
crude
attempts
at
conversation
her
uncouth
language
and
raw
expressions
the
girl
turned
her
horse
toward
the
hotel
entrance
as
she
drew
still
nearer
he
saw
that
she
was
not
pretty
her
mouth
was
too
large
her
face
too
strong
her
skin
too
tanned
by
the
sun
and
wind
at
the
sidewalk
the
girl
swung
from
the
saddle
lightly
and
throwing
the
bridle
reins
over
the
horse
head
with
a
movement
that
brought
out
the
beautiful
lines
of
her
figure
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
pawing
restless
animal
with
as
little
concern
as
though
she
had
delivered
him
to
a
correctly
uniformed
groom
no
she
was
not
pretty
she
was
magnificent
the
adjective
forced
itself
upon
him
all
along
the
arcade
people
were
smiling
in
greeting
the
men
lifting
their
hats
two
cowboys
in
boots
and
chaps
paused
in
passing
that
new
hawss
of
yours
is
sure
some
hawss
miss
barbara
said
one
admiringly
sombrero
in
hand
the
girl
smiled
and
holmes
saw
the
flash
of
her
perfect
teeth
oh
he
do
bob
when
i
worked
him
down
a
little
she
passed
into
the
hotel
followed
by
the
eyes
of
every
man
in
sight
including
the
engineer
who
had
noted
with
surprise
the
purity
and
richness
of
her
voice
the
new
york
man
had
turned
and
was
watching
a
company
of
indians
farther
down
the
street
when
that
voice
close
beside
him
said
i
beg
your
pardon
is
this
mr
holmes
he
turned
quickly
rising
to
his
feet
she
smiled
at
his
astonished
look
the
clerk
pointed
you
out
to
me
i
am
barbara
worth
you
met
father
at
the
bank
this
morning
texas
joe
and
pat
told
me
about
your
being
here
and
i
could
scarcely
wait
to
see
you
i
afraid
you
must
have
thought
them
a
little
rough
last
night
but
really
it
only
their
fun
they
as
good
as
gold
as
she
stood
now
close
to
him
the
red
blood
glowing
under
the
soft
brown
of
her
cheeks
willard
holmes
felt
her
rich
personality
as
distinctly
as
one
senses
the
presence
of
the
ocean
the
atmosphere
of
the
woods
or
the
air
of
meadows
and
fields
but
by
all
his
conventional
gods
this
was
the
unconventional
limit
that
this
girl
the
daughter
of
a
banker
should
openly
seek
out
a
total
stranger
to
introduce
herself
to
him
on
the
public
street
before
a
crowd
of
hotel
loungers
and
the
way
she
spoke
of
those
rough
men
in
the
saloon
one
would
think
they
were
her
intimate
friends
he
managed
to
say
really
i
am
delighted
miss
worth
may
i
escort
you
to
the
hotel
parlor
she
looked
at
him
curiously
oh
no
indeed
it
is
much
nicer
out
here
in
the
arcade
do
you
think
but
you
may
bring
another
chair
dumbly
he
obeyed
feeling
that
every
eye
was
on
him
and
flushing
with
embarrassment
for
her
when
texas
and
pat
told
me
that
you
were
one
of
the
engineers
going
out
with
the
king
basin
party
i
could
scarcely
wait
to
see
you
it
makes
it
all
seem
so
real
you
know
your
coming
all
the
way
out
here
from
new
york
i
have
dreamed
so
much
about
the
reclamation
of
the
king
basin
desert
and
you
see
i
consider
all
civil
engineers
my
personal
friends
indeed
he
said
it
is
always
safely
correct
to
say
indeed
as
he
said
it
particularly
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
say
she
regarded
him
doubtfully
with
an
open
look
which
was
somewhat
disconcerting
she
was
so
unconscious
of
the
strength
of
her
splendid
womanhood
and
he
felt
her
presence
so
vividly
i
suppose
you
must
find
everything
out
here
very
strange
she
said
slowly
father
says
this
is
your
first
visit
to
the
west
and
of
course
it
be
like
your
part
of
the
country
it
is
all
very
interesting
he
murmured
this
also
was
sane
and
safe
i
know
that
abe
is
very
busy
and
father
never
leaves
the
bank
except
on
business
so
there
is
no
one
but
me
to
look
after
you
she
smiled
that
is
no
one
of
our
king
basin
people
willard
holmes
was
of
that
type
of
corporation
servant
who
recognizes
no
interests
but
the
financial
interests
of
the
capital
employing
him
his
services
as
a
civil
engineer
belonged
wholly
to
those
who
bought
them
for
their
own
profit
barbara
innocent
words
aroused
him
what
the
deuce
did
she
mean
by
our
king
basin
people
greenfield
and
his
friends
thought
that
were
the
king
basin
people
in
the
interests
of
his
employers
he
must
look
into
this
illustration
but
i
do
ride
you
know
it
is
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
he
said
with
a
little
more
warmth
to
tell
the
truth
i
feeling
a
bit
strange
you
know
i
sure
you
must
be
nearly
dead
with
lonesomeness
would
you
like
to
go
for
a
ride
i
would
so
like
to
show
you
my
desert
desert
he
mentally
observed
indeed
he
must
look
into
this
fully
alert
now
he
answered
heartily
i
should
be
delighted
i
sure
you
are
more
than
kind
when
could
we
go
right
now
she
said
quickly
here
comes
pablo
garcia
i
send
him
for
another
horse
she
called
to
the
passing
mexican
here
pablo
the
young
fellow
came
to
her
quickly
and
stood
sombrero
in
hand
his
dark
eyes
shining
with
pride
at
the
recognition
in
spanish
she
directed
him
to
fetch
a
horse
for
the
senor
si
senorita
with
a
low
bow
the
mexican
turned
to
obey
the
eastern
man
not
understanding
the
words
but
awakening
suddenly
to
the
meaning
of
the
action
broke
forth
with
here
wait
a
minute
wait
repeated
barbara
in
spanish
pablo
paused
you
are
sending
him
for
a
horse
and
saddle
asked
holmes
yes
it
will
take
only
a
few
minutes
but
i
do
ride
you
know
you
do
ride
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
blank
amazement
i
think
i
ever
saw
a
man
before
who
did
ride
he
laughed
indulgently
something
in
her
voice
and
manner
touched
his
sense
of
humor
i
very
sorry
i
know
i
ought
to
he
said
in
mock
humility
oh
well
we
can
drive
i
have
pablo
bring
a
rig
she
explained
what
she
wanted
to
the
mexican
in
his
native
tongue
and
this
time
he
mounted
her
horse
and
rode
away
when
the
man
returned
a
little
later
with
a
span
of
restless
broncos
hitched
to
a
light
buggy
the
girl
stepped
into
the
vehicle
and
took
the
reins
as
a
matter
of
course
with
a
low
chuckle
of
amusement
the
engineer
took
his
place
at
her
left
he
was
beginning
really
to
enjoy
the
situation
shying
and
plunging
the
team
demanded
all
of
barbara
attention
but
she
managed
to
steal
a
look
at
her
silent
companion
now
and
then
as
if
expecting
him
to
show
signs
of
nervousness
willard
holmes
on
his
part
was
wrapped
in
silent
admiration
of
her
strength
and
skill
they
cool
down
in
a
little
while
the
girl
volunteered
as
if
to
reassure
her
guest
after
a
particularly
wild
break
on
the
part
of
the
horses
but
on
the
extreme
edge
of
town
where
the
wagon
road
runs
closest
to
the
railroad
track
a
passing
switch
engine
proved
too
much
for
the
excited
team
in
a
moment
the
frightened
animals
were
running
toward
the
mesa
at
full
speed
with
all
her
strength
barbara
struggled
to
regain
control
but
her
arms
were
a
woman
arms
and
the
horses
quick
to
recognize
their
advantage
put
back
their
ears
and
ran
the
faster
in
mad
defiance
the
girl
was
not
frightened
she
was
annoyed
i
i
afraid
they
are
running
away
she
gasped
at
last
to
her
surprise
a
hearty
laugh
was
the
only
answer
to
her
confession
she
shot
a
quick
glance
over
her
left
shoulder
her
companion
was
leaning
back
in
his
seat
his
merry
face
expressing
the
keenest
enjoyment
then
the
girl
felt
a
big
hard
shoulder
pressing
against
her
long
powerful
arms
stretched
over
hers
and
two
masterful
hands
closed
on
the
reins
above
her
cramped
fingers
she
relinquished
her
hold
and
shrank
back
out
of
the
way
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
yes
a
look
of
admiration
as
the
horses
with
a
few
wild
leaps
and
ineffectual
attempts
to
run
again
settled
down
to
a
more
rational
gait
my
she
gasped
at
the
exhibition
of
the
engineer
strength
i
believe
you
could
pull
their
front
feet
off
the
ground
her
companion
was
still
smiling
why
did
you
tell
me
you
could
drive
she
demanded
he
chuckled
maliciously
for
he
had
understood
her
reason
for
taking
the
reins
at
the
start
and
he
had
not
been
insensible
of
the
meaning
of
her
glances
at
the
beginning
of
the
ride
you
did
ask
me
and
besides
i
enjoyed
seeing
you
handle
them
but
you
told
me
you
could
she
said
reproachfully
i
ca
he
returned
that
is
i
never
did
not
as
you
people
in
this
country
ride
then
he
laughed
again
confess
now
did
you
expect
me
to
jump
back
there
i
shall
confess
nothing
she
retorted
sharply
and
hereafter
i
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
on
the
high
ground
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
the
canyon
mouth
she
asked
him
to
turn
around
and
stop
willard
holmes
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
team
and
the
girl
to
notice
the
landscape
and
now
that
wonderful
view
of
the
mesa
the
king
basin
and
the
mountains
burst
upon
him
without
warning
no
sane
man
could
be
insensible
of
the
grandeur
of
that
scene
the
man
whose
eyes
had
looked
only
upon
eastern
landscapes
that
bore
in
every
square
foot
of
their
limited
range
the
evidence
of
man
presence
was
silent
before
the
mighty
expanse
of
desert
that
lay
as
it
was
fashioned
by
the
creative
forces
that
formed
the
world
turning
at
last
from
the
glorious
scenes
wrought
in
colors
of
gold
and
rose
and
lilac
and
purple
and
blue
to
the
girl
whose
eyes
were
fixed
questioningly
upon
him
he
said
in
a
low
voice
is
it
always
like
this
barbara
nodded
always
like
that
but
always
changing
it
is
never
the
same
but
always
the
same
like
like
life
itself
do
you
understand
he
turned
again
to
the
scene
in
silent
wonder
do
you
like
my
desert
she
asked
after
a
little
time
had
passed
his
mind
caught
at
the
expression
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
is
the
king
basin
that
we
are
going
to
work
why
of
course
she
laughed
uneasily
do
you
like
it
like
it
he
repeated
but
is
there
anyone
living
out
there
she
was
amazed
at
his
words
living
there
of
course
not
but
you
are
going
to
make
it
so
that
thousands
and
thousands
can
live
there
you
and
the
others
do
you
understand
her
voice
expressed
a
shade
of
impatience
i
afraid
i
did
not
realize
he
answered
slowly
that
just
it
she
cried
thoroughly
aroused
now
and
speaking
passionately
that
just
the
trouble
with
you
eastern
men
you
realize
for
years
the
dear
old
seer
and
a
few
others
have
been
trying
to
make
you
see
what
a
work
there
is
to
do
out
here
and
you
wo
even
look
up
from
your
little
old
truck
patches
to
give
them
intelligent
attention
you
think
this
king
basin
is
big
why
the
seer
says
that
if
every
foot
of
that
land
was
under
cultivation
it
would
be
a
posy
bed
beside
what
there
is
to
do
in
the
west
i
suppose
you
must
have
done
some
great
things
in
your
profession
holmes
or
those
capitalists
would
have
sent
you
out
here
but
you
ca
have
done
anything
that
will
mean
to
the
world
what
the
reclamation
of
the
basin
desert
will
mean
one
hundred
years
from
now
because
this
work
is
going
to
make
the
people
realize
do
you
see
the
young
engineer
face
flushed
under
her
words
and
as
he
watched
her
strong
face
glowing
with
enthusiasm
for
the
seer
dream
he
felt
the
sweet
power
of
her
personality
sweep
over
him
as
he
felt
the
breeze
from
off
the
desert
he
was
held
as
though
by
some
magic
spell
not
by
the
lure
of
her
splendid
womanhood
but
by
that
and
something
else
something
that
was
like
the
country
of
which
she
spoke
so
passionately
and
he
remembered
wondering
if
this
girl
could
talk
he
relieved
the
tense
strain
of
the
situation
by
holding
out
the
reins
and
saying
with
a
whimsical
smile
here
you
can
drive
she
caught
his
meaning
and
smiled
in
acknowledgment
thank
you
but
i
do
want
to
drive
that
really
the
man
part
you
know
i
suppose
she
added
that
you
think
me
bold
and
mannish
and
coarse
and
everything
else
that
a
girl
ought
not
to
be
but
i
she
turned
away
her
face
and
her
voice
trembled
but
you
ca
understand
holmes
what
this
desert
means
to
me
perhaps
i
do
understand
he
said
seriously
but
i
am
sure
of
this
somewhere
back
of
every
really
great
work
that
has
ever
been
accomplished
in
any
age
there
has
been
a
woman
like
you
then
they
drove
back
to
the
hotel
where
she
left
him
and
drove
to
the
barn
herself
a
few
minutes
later
he
saw
her
pass
again
riding
her
own
horse
during
the
two
weeks
that
followed
before
the
seer
return
while
abe
lee
was
busy
getting
ready
for
the
work
in
barbara
desert
willard
holmes
and
the
girl
were
often
together
the
man
from
new
york
admitted
somewhat
proudly
barbara
thought
as
if
the
very
confession
somehow
established
the
superiority
of
the
east
that
he
was
shockingly
ignorant
of
all
things
western
but
apparently
overlooking
the
subtle
assumption
in
the
manner
of
his
confession
she
laughingly
undertook
his
education
for
one
thing
he
must
learn
to
ride
really
he
demurred
i
do
think
i
care
for
that
particular
amusement
i
have
never
taken
it
up
at
home
you
know
but
of
course
if
it
is
the
thing
to
do
why
amusement
she
laughed
riding
is
an
amusement
it
a
necessity
the
horse
is
our
street
car
and
railroad
and
steamboat
where
you
think
city
blocks
and
squares
we
think
miles
and
where
you
think
miles
we
think
hundreds
of
miles
two
legs
are
not
enough
in
this
country
so
we
double
the
number
and
go
on
four
you
find
yourself
wishing
for
eight
before
you
get
back
from
the
king
basin
so
at
her
bidding
texas
joe
secured
a
horse
for
him
and
almost
every
afternoon
the
two
were
in
their
saddles
and
every
night
over
his
evening
cigar
at
the
hotel
the
engineer
found
himself
reviewing
the
incidents
and
conversations
of
the
ride
forced
to
wonder
at
some
new
and
unexpected
revelation
of
the
mind
and
character
of
this
western
girl
who
was
so
interested
in
the
reclamation
work
and
so
unconscious
of
her
womanly
power
he
came
quickly
to
look
forward
to
their
hours
together
and
to
plan
and
carry
out
many
conversational
experiments
invariably
he
had
his
reward
one
afternoon
he
tried
skillfully
to
shape
the
conversation
to
the
end
that
he
might
tell
her
quite
without
ostentation
of
the
proud
history
and
social
position
of
his
family
and
of
his
own
rank
in
the
upper
eastern
world
she
humored
him
patiently
helping
him
out
with
questions
and
artless
admiring
exclamations
and
comments
until
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
properly
impressed
then
she
said
in
a
tone
of
honest
sympathy
but
you
must
let
all
this
worry
you
you
know
worry
me
he
echoed
in
amazement
she
nodded
seriously
but
with
a
glint
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
yes
i
can
understand
that
it
must
be
hard
for
a
man
to
do
his
work
handicapped
as
you
are
but
no
one
away
out
here
will
count
it
against
you
every
man
here
has
a
chance
no
matter
what
his
past
has
been
you
see
we
do
care
what
a
man
has
been
or
what
his
fathers
were
we
accept
him
for
what
he
is
and
value
him
for
what
he
can
do
so
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
forget
and
go
straight
ahead
with
your
work
and
easily
live
it
down
only
of
course
she
added
gently
i
advise
you
to
tell
what
you
have
told
me
some
might
not
understand
he
retorted
warmly
of
course
you
can
not
understand
our
point
of
view
everything
is
so
new
and
raw
out
here
that
you
have
no
social
standards
new
and
raw
she
laughed
again
why
holmes
you
are
the
only
new
thing
in
this
country
do
you
see
that
man
over
there
they
were
riding
south
on
the
road
that
follows
the
river
and
she
pointed
to
an
indian
who
sat
idly
in
the
shade
of
his
pole
and
mud
hut
what
the
matter
with
him
asked
the
engineer
nothing
only
he
too
has
ancestors
ages
and
ages
before
your
forefathers
knew
that
this
continent
existed
that
man
people
lived
in
a
city
not
far
from
here
a
city
with
laws
customs
religions
social
standards
yes
and
civil
engineers
for
you
can
easily
trace
the
lines
of
their
canals
in
which
they
brought
water
from
the
river
and
carried
it
through
a
tunnel
in
the
mountains
to
irrigate
their
land
just
as
you
modern
engineers
are
planning
to
do
the
seer
and
i
rode
over
there
once
and
he
told
me
about
it
i
show
you
if
you
like
why
the
west
was
ages
old
before
the
east
was
discovered
the
seer
says
that
if
columbus
had
come
first
to
the
western
coast
new
england
would
still
be
an
uninhabitable
howling
wilderness
but
i
do
see
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
social
standards
he
said
nettled
at
her
reply
simply
this
if
a
man
position
in
life
is
to
be
fixed
by
the
age
of
his
family
or
the
number
of
years
that
they
have
occupied
a
certain
section
of
the
country
then
that
indian
is
your
superior
his
ancestors
lived
here
long
before
yours
settled
in
new
england
but
we
are
proud
of
our
ancestors
because
of
what
they
were
and
what
they
accomplished
we
have
a
right
to
be
think
of
what
the
world
owes
them
oh
i
must
have
misunderstood
you
you
seemed
to
place
so
much
emphasis
on
their
having
come
over
in
the
mayflower
they
grand
those
brave
old
pioneers
i
am
proud
of
them
too
for
what
they
were
and
did
they
have
social
positions
by
which
they
fixed
a
place
in
life
i
wonder
of
course
they
could
not
have
had
a
society
with
the
wealth
and
culture
that
we
have
now
the
country
was
all
new
something
like
the
west
is
i
suppose
she
laughed
aloud
and
you
are
proud
of
them
how
fine
is
it
splendid
to
think
that
in
two
or
three
hundred
years
when
the
west
has
been
civilized
and
the
desert
reclaimed
as
your
pioneer
forefathers
civilized
and
reclaimed
the
east
when
wealth
and
culture
have
come
a
man
social
standing
will
be
determined
by
his
relation
to
and
people
will
be
proud
of
what
are
doing
after
all
holmes
the
only
difference
between
the
east
and
the
west
seems
to
be
that
you
ancestors
and
that
we
are
to
ancestors
you
look
back
to
what
has
been
we
look
forward
to
what
will
be
you
are
proud
and
take
rank
because
of
what
your
forefathers
did
we
are
proud
and
take
rank
because
of
what
we
are
doing
and
we
are
doing
exactly
what
they
did
honestly
now
which
would
you
rather
worship
an
ancestor
or
be
an
ancestor
worshipped
when
they
had
laughed
together
over
this
he
said
i
am
beginning
to
understand
miss
worth
that
the
ideal
american
whom
we
are
always
hearing
about
but
never
meet
must
be
a
westerner
he
could
possibly
be
of
the
east
could
he
his
words
were
almost
a
sneer
the
ideal
american
is
neither
eastern
nor
western
in
the
way
you
mean
holmes
he
is
both
indeed
you
admit
that
we
of
the
east
could
give
him
something
then
you
could
give
him
all
that
your
forefathers
have
given
you
and
what
could
the
west
give
him
she
looked
at
him
steadily
a
moment
before
answering
slowly
i
think
you
will
have
to
find
that
out
for
yourself
he
was
taken
a
little
aback
by
her
answer
it
sounded
as
though
she
wished
to
end
the
conversation
but
her
talk
had
stirred
him
strongly
though
he
tried
to
hide
this
under
cover
of
a
cynical
tone
he
said
triumphantly
but
you
see
after
all
you
admit
that
one
is
not
altogether
hopeless
because
he
happens
to
come
of
a
good
family
certainly
i
admit
it
she
cried
but
do
you
see
what
i
mean
ancestors
are
to
be
counted
as
a
valuable
asset
but
not
as
working
capital
as
she
spoke
she
turned
toward
him
again
with
that
steady
look
and
the
man
felt
the
strange
mysterious
power
of
her
personality
the
challenging
lure
of
her
young
womanhood
that
and
more
what
was
it
back
of
those
steady
eyes
that
called
to
him
inspired
him
that
almost
frightened
him
that
made
him
feel
as
barbara
herself
felt
in
the
presence
of
the
desert
there
was
no
trace
of
cynicism
in
his
voice
now
nor
any
hint
of
a
sneer
on
his
face
as
willard
holmes
straightened
unconsciously
in
his
saddle
by
george
he
said
it
good
to
hear
you
say
those
things
nobody
talks
that
way
nowadays
i
suppose
our
did
though
she
colored
with
pleasure
but
answered
lightly
that
puts
me
a
long
ways
behind
the
times
does
it
or
a
long
way
ahead
he
offered
in
the
meantime
while
the
education
of
willard
holmes
progressed
the
party
that
was
to
make
the
first
survey
in
barbara
desert
was
being
formed
and
equipped
under
the
direction
of
abe
lee
horses
mules
wagons
camp
outfits
and
supplies
with
indian
and
mexican
laborers
teamsters
of
several
nationalities
and
here
and
there
a
chinese
cook
were
assembled
toward
the
last
from
every
part
of
the
great
west
country
came
the
surveyors
and
engineers
sunburned
men
most
of
them
toughened
by
their
life
overflowing
with
health
and
good
spirits
they
hailed
one
another
joyously
and
greeted
abe
with
extravagant
delight
overwhelming
him
with
questions
for
the
word
had
gone
out
that
the
seer
beloved
by
all
the
tribe
and
his
lieutenant
almost
equally
beloved
were
making
big
medicine
in
the
king
basin
desert
not
a
man
of
them
would
have
exchanged
his
chance
to
go
for
a
crown
and
scepter
the
eastern
engineer
met
these
hardened
professional
brothers
cordially
he
listened
to
their
reminiscences
of
life
and
work
in
mountain
plain
and
desert
with
interest
discovering
to
his
surprise
that
most
of
them
were
eastern
born
and
bred
with
technical
training
in
the
schools
with
which
he
was
familiar
but
their
almost
boyish
enthusiasm
over
the
work
ahead
their
admiration
for
the
chief
and
for
abe
lee
he
viewed
with
cold
indifference
with
all
his
duties
abe
found
frequent
opportunity
to
report
to
barbara
for
the
girl
interest
in
every
detail
of
the
preparations
was
never
failing
her
friends
protested
that
they
never
saw
her
now
at
their
little
social
affairs
for
she
was
always
off
somewhere
with
some
engineer
and
that
when
they
did
chance
to
catch
her
alone
she
would
talk
of
nothing
but
that
horrid
king
basin
country
every
evening
early
after
supper
the
surveyor
would
slip
away
from
his
companions
at
the
hotel
to
spend
an
hour
on
the
veranda
at
the
banker
home
talking
in
his
straightforward
way
with
barbara
and
her
father
of
the
work
that
was
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
girl
and
because
it
was
his
work
and
in
the
nature
of
a
report
to
one
who
he
felt
had
in
some
subtle
way
authority
to
hear
abe
talked
with
a
freedom
that
would
have
astonished
many
of
his
friends
who
thought
they
knew
him
best
three
times
while
abe
was
there
willard
holmes
appeared
and
each
time
at
the
engineer
presence
the
surveyor
painful
diffidence
became
apparent
and
he
soon
with
some
stammering
excuse
left
the
last
time
this
happened
barbara
walked
down
to
the
gate
with
the
painfully
embarrassed
surveyor
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
coming
of
the
chief
who
would
arrive
the
next
day
and
the
following
morning
the
expedition
would
start
for
the
field
buenos
noches
hermano
good
night
brother
called
barbara
as
the
tall
surveyor
walked
away
down
the
street
buenos
noches
came
the
answer
willard
holmes
heard
and
frowned
you
seem
to
be
very
fond
of
spanish
miss
worth
he
said
when
the
girl
came
back
to
the
porch
i
notice
you
use
it
so
often
with
our
long
friend
there
barbara
laughed
at
his
evident
displeasure
the
language
seems
to
belong
so
to
this
country
to
me
its
colors
are
all
soft
and
warm
like
the
colors
of
the
desert
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
i
suppose
i
use
it
so
often
with
abe
because
he
too
seems
to
belong
to
this
country
the
engineer
looked
at
her
curiously
i
do
think
i
quite
see
the
connection
you
mean
that
he
has
spanish
blood
not
at
all
said
barbara
quickly
but
he
is
and
he
has
the
same
patient
stillness
the
same
natural
bigness
and
the
same
unconquerable
hardness
oh
but
you
say
the
desert
is
not
unconquerable
that
it
will
be
subdued
your
analogy
is
at
fault
no
holmes
it
is
you
who
do
not
understand
there
is
something
about
this
country
that
will
always
remain
as
it
is
now
abe
lee
is
like
that
whatever
changes
may
come
he
will
always
be
abe
lee
of
the
desert
your
views
are
really
poetical
and
your
character
analyses
very
clever
miss
worth
but
after
all
men
are
men
wherever
you
find
them
human
nature
is
the
same
the
world
over
oh
i
sure
that
is
so
holmes
i
know
there
must
be
many
western
men
in
the
east
only
they
have
found
themselves
yet
he
laughed
heartily
as
he
rose
to
go
will
you
ever
bid
me
good
night
in
your
language
of
the
desert
he
asked
perhaps
when
you
have
learned
that
language
she
said
with
an
answering
smile
by
george
i
shall
try
to
learn
it
he
answered
oh
i
wish
you
would
came
the
earnest
answer
i
know
you
could
and
again
the
engineer
felt
strongly
back
of
her
words
that
unvoiced
appeal
as
he
went
down
the
street
he
knew
that
she
did
not
refer
to
the
spanish
tongue
when
she
wished
him
to
learn
the
language
of
her
desert
alone
in
her
room
that
night
barbara
mind
was
too
active
for
sleep
and
she
sat
for
a
long
time
by
the
open
window
looking
out
into
the
vast
silent
world
under
the
still
stars
until
she
introduced
herself
to
willard
holmes
barbara
had
never
known
eastern
people
tourists
she
had
seen
and
at
rare
intervals
met
in
a
casual
way
but
they
had
always
examined
her
with
such
frankly
curious
eyes
that
she
had
felt
like
some
strange
animal
on
exhibition
and
had
repaid
their
interest
with
all
the
indifference
she
could
command
occasionally
also
she
had
been
introduced
to
eastern
business
men
whom
she
chanced
upon
talking
with
her
father
in
the
bank
but
they
had
turned
quickly
away
to
the
matters
of
their
world
after
the
usual
polite
nothings
demanded
by
the
introduction
the
and
life
of
willard
holmes
were
as
foreign
to
her
as
her
land
and
life
were
strange
to
him
so
it
happened
in
this
instance
also
that
in
the
education
of
the
eastern
engineer
the
teacher
learned
quite
as
much
as
the
pupil
the
traits
that
stood
out
so
prominently
in
the
western
men
whom
barbara
knew
and
so
much
admired
were
in
willard
holmes
buried
deeply
under
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
life
and
thought
of
the
world
to
which
he
belonged
buried
so
deeply
that
the
man
himself
scarcely
realized
that
they
were
there
and
so
was
led
to
wonder
at
himself
when
his
blood
tingled
with
some
strong
presentation
of
this
western
views
but
barbara
knew
beneath
the
conventionalities
of
his
class
the
girl
felt
the
man
a
powerful
character
with
all
the
latent
strength
of
his
ancestors
she
wanted
him
as
she
put
it
to
herself
to
wake
up
would
he
would
he
learn
the
language
of
her
desert
she
believed
that
he
would
even
as
she
believed
in
the
reclamation
of
the
king
basin
lands
and
she
was
glad
glad
that
the
seer
and
abe
and
tex
and
pat
and
her
father
the
men
who
had
brought
her
out
of
the
desert
were
going
now
back
into
that
land
of
death
to
save
that
land
itself
from
itself
and
she
whispered
it
softly
under
the
stars
she
was
glad
glad
that
willard
holmes
had
come
to
go
with
them
to
learn
the
language
of
her
land
chapter
viii
why
willard
holmes
stayed
slowly
day
by
day
the
surveying
party
under
the
seer
pushed
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
awful
desolation
of
the
king
basin
desert
they
were
the
advance
force
of
a
mighty
army
ordered
ahead
by
good
business
the
master
passion
of
the
race
their
duty
was
to
learn
the
strength
of
the
enemy
to
measure
its
resources
to
spy
out
its
weaknesses
and
to
gather
data
upon
which
a
campaign
would
be
planned
under
the
seer
the
expedition
was
divided
into
several
smaller
parties
each
of
which
was
assigned
to
certain
defined
districts
here
and
there
at
seemingly
careless
intervals
in
the
wide
expanse
the
white
tents
of
the
division
camps
shone
through
the
many
colored
veils
of
the
desert
tall
thin
columns
of
dust
lifted
into
the
sky
from
the
water
wagons
that
crawled
ceaselessly
from
water
hole
to
camp
and
from
camp
to
water
hole
hung
in
long
clouds
above
the
supply
train
laboring
heavily
across
the
dun
plain
to
and
from
rubio
city
or
rose
in
quick
puffs
and
twisting
spirals
from
the
feet
of
some
saddle
horse
bearing
a
messenger
from
the
chief
to
some
distant
lieutenant
every
morning
from
each
of
the
camps
squads
of
men
bearing
transit
and
level
stake
and
pole
and
flag
the
weapons
of
their
warfare
put
out
in
different
directions
into
the
vast
silence
that
seemed
to
engulf
them
every
evening
the
squads
returned
and
weary
to
their
rest
under
the
lonesome
stars
every
morning
the
sun
broke
fiercely
up
from
the
long
level
of
the
eastward
plain
to
pour
its
hot
strength
down
upon
these
pigmy
creatures
who
dared
to
invade
the
territory
over
which
he
had
for
so
many
ages
held
undisputed
dominion
every
evening
the
sun
plunged
fiercely
down
behind
the
purple
wall
of
mountains
that
shut
in
the
basin
on
the
west
as
if
to
gather
strength
in
some
nether
world
for
fight
always
there
was
the
same
flood
of
white
light
from
the
deep
dry
sky
that
was
uncrossed
by
shred
of
cloud
always
the
same
wide
tawny
waste
harshly
glaring
near
at
hand
filled
with
awful
mysteries
under
the
many
colored
mists
of
the
distance
until
the
eyes
ached
and
the
soul
cried
out
in
wonder
at
it
all
always
there
were
the
same
deep
nights
with
the
lonely
stars
so
far
away
in
the
velvet
purple
darkness
the
soft
breathing
of
the
desert
the
pungent
smell
of
greasewood
and
the
weird
quavering
call
of
the
ground
owl
or
the
wild
coyote
chorus
as
if
the
long
lost
spirits
of
long
ago
savage
races
cried
out
a
dreadful
warning
to
these
invaders
and
in
all
of
this
the
land
made
itself
felt
against
these
men
in
the
silent
menace
the
still
waiting
the
subtle
call
the
promise
the
threat
and
the
challenge
of
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
to
barbara
who
rode
often
in
those
days
to
the
very
rim
of
the
basin
there
to
search
the
wild
wide
land
with
straining
eyes
for
signs
of
her
friends
the
white
glare
of
the
camps
was
lost
in
the
bewildering
maze
of
color
the
columns
clouds
and
spirals
of
dust
save
perhaps
from
a
near
supply
wagon
coming
in
or
passing
out
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
whirling
that
danced
always
over
the
hot
plains
the
toiling
pigmy
dots
of
the
little
army
were
far
beyond
her
vision
range
it
was
as
though
the
fierce
land
had
swallowed
up
horses
wagons
and
men
only
through
the
frequent
letters
brought
by
the
freighters
did
she
know
that
all
was
going
well
perhaps
the
gray
lizard
that
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
line
stake
wondered
at
the
strange
new
growth
that
had
sprung
so
suddenly
from
the
familiar
soil
or
perhaps
the
scuttling
to
cover
marveled
at
the
strange
sounds
as
the
stakes
were
driven
and
man
called
to
man
figures
and
directions
perhaps
the
scaly
springing
his
warning
rattle
at
the
approaching
step
questioned
what
new
enemy
this
was
or
the
lone
buzzard
wheeling
high
over
head
watched
the
tiny
moving
figures
with
wondering
hopefulness
and
the
coyote
that
hushed
for
a
little
his
wild
music
to
follow
up
the
wind
this
strange
new
scent
laughed
at
the
seer
dream
these
lines
of
stakes
that
every
day
stretched
farther
and
farther
into
and
across
the
waste
seemed
in
the
wideness
of
the
land
pitifully
foolish
looking
back
over
the
lines
the
men
who
set
them
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
way
they
had
come
but
they
knew
that
the
stakes
were
there
they
knew
that
some
day
that
other
mightier
company
the
main
army
would
move
along
the
way
they
had
marked
to
meet
the
strength
of
the
barren
waste
with
the
strength
of
the
great
river
and
take
for
the
race
the
wealth
of
the
land
the
sound
of
human
voices
was
flat
and
ineffectual
in
that
solitude
but
the
speakers
knew
that
following
their
feeble
voices
would
come
the
shouting
ringing
thundering
chorus
of
the
life
that
was
to
follow
them
into
that
silent
land
of
death
with
the
slow
passing
of
the
weeks
came
the
trying
out
and
testing
of
character
inevitable
to
such
a
work
the
concealing
habits
of
civilization
were
dropped
kindly
useful
conventionalities
were
lost
face
to
face
with
the
unconquered
forces
of
nature
nothing
remained
but
the
real
strength
or
weakness
of
the
individual
himself
in
some
there
were
developed
unguessed
powers
of
endurance
that
bore
the
hard
days
without
flinching
cheerful
optimism
that
laughed
at
the
appalling
immensity
of
the
task
strength
of
spirit
that
made
a
jest
of
galling
discomforts
courage
that
smiled
in
the
face
of
dangers
these
were
the
strength
of
the
party
some
there
were
who
grew
sullen
quarrelsome
and
vicious
in
a
kind
of
mad
rebellion
these
must
be
held
in
check
controlled
and
governed
by
the
seer
with
the
assistance
of
abe
lee
and
his
helpers
some
became
silent
and
moody
faint
hearted
and
afraid
these
were
strengthened
and
guarded
and
given
fresh
courage
some
grew
peevish
and
fretful
whining
and
complaining
these
were
disciplined
wisely
forced
gently
into
line
some
staggered
and
fell
by
the
way
these
were
sent
back
and
the
ranks
closed
up
but
the
work
always
the
work
went
on
to
willard
holmes
the
life
was
a
slow
torture
a
revelation
and
an
education
he
found
himself
stripped
of
everything
upon
which
he
was
accustomed
to
rely
family
traditions
social
position
influential
friends
scholarship
experience
in
the
world
to
which
he
was
born
all
these
were
nothing
in
the
hollow
of
god
hand
slowly
he
learned
that
the
power
of
such
wealth
is
limited
to
certain
fields
new
york
was
very
far
away
he
felt
that
he
had
been
hopelessly
banished
to
a
strange
world
many
times
he
would
have
thrown
it
all
up
and
turned
back
with
other
deserters
but
there
was
red
blood
in
his
veins
stubborn
pride
and
the
thought
of
the
girl
who
had
hoped
that
he
would
learn
the
language
of
her
country
enabled
him
to
hold
on
once
he
ventured
to
speak
to
the
chief
in
a
hopeless
voice
of
the
evident
impossibility
of
ever
converting
that
terrible
land
into
a
habitable
country
and
the
seer
strong
in
the
strength
of
his
dream
had
looked
at
him
from
the
still
depth
of
his
brown
eyes
without
a
word
looked
until
the
younger
man
had
turned
away
his
cheeks
flushed
with
shame
and
his
spirit
doing
homage
to
the
strength
of
the
master
spirit
of
the
work
and
the
eastern
engineer
remembered
with
new
understanding
his
talks
with
barbara
worth
when
they
pulled
the
dead
coyote
from
the
only
water
hole
within
two
days
travel
and
holmes
nearly
fainted
at
the
sickening
sight
it
was
texas
joe
who
saved
the
day
for
him
by
remarking
with
an
air
of
philosophical
musing
after
a
deep
draught
of
the
tepid
tainted
water
hit
ai
so
bad
as
you
might
think
holmes
onct
your
oilfactory
nerves
has
become
somewhat
regulated
to
the
aroma
and
your
palate
has
been
eddicated
to
the
point
of
appreciatin
the
deliciously
foreign
flavor
in
the
judgment
of
some
connysoors
it
has
several
points
the
lead
of
them
imported
fancy
drinks
you
get
in
frisco
when
a
mexican
died
horribly
from
the
bite
of
a
rattlesnake
and
holmes
himself
was
barely
saved
from
a
like
fate
by
the
prompt
action
and
ready
knowledge
of
abe
lee
it
was
the
slow
smile
of
the
surveyor
that
stiffened
him
to
go
on
and
when
he
was
nearly
beaten
by
a
three
days
so
searching
that
even
the
and
bacon
gritted
in
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
smarted
in
his
head
like
coals
of
fire
and
his
skin
felt
as
though
it
had
been
when
he
would
have
sold
his
soul
for
a
bath
and
actually
began
to
get
his
things
together
in
readiness
for
the
next
wagon
out
it
was
pat
who
with
the
devilish
ingenuity
of
an
irish
imp
mocked
and
jeered
at
him
for
a
quitter
fit
to
act
only
as
lady
maid
or
to
serve
soft
dhrinks
in
a
corner
until
his
fainting
heart
took
fire
and
cursing
his
tormentor
with
all
the
oaths
he
could
muster
he
offered
to
whip
the
whole
grinning
camp
and
stayed
thus
he
was
advanced
to
the
second
degree
when
he
began
to
sense
the
spirit
of
the
untamed
land
and
of
the
men
who
went
to
meet
it
with
sheer
joy
of
the
conquest
when
he
began
to
glory
in
the
very
greatness
of
the
task
and
the
long
dormant
spirit
of
his
ancestors
stirred
within
him
as
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
vision
that
inspired
the
seer
or
perhaps
it
should
be
written
the
vision
that
tempted
his
employers
james
greenfield
and
his
fellow
capitalists
he
was
still
far
from
ready
for
the
final
degree
but
even
that
might
come
through
all
those
hard
days
jefferson
worth
moved
with
the
same
careful
precise
certain
manner
that
distinguished
him
in
his
work
at
home
even
the
desert
sun
that
so
tanned
blistered
and
blackened
the
faces
of
his
companions
could
not
mark
the
gray
pallor
of
that
face
no
disturbing
incident
or
unforeseen
difficulty
could
wring
from
him
an
exclamation
or
change
the
measured
tones
of
his
colorless
voice
he
seemed
to
accept
everything
as
though
he
had
foreseen
carefully
considered
and
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
before
it
came
to
pass
day
after
day
he
rode
in
every
direction
over
the
land
within
easy
reach
of
the
many
camps
familiarizing
himself
with
every
detail
of
the
work
observing
soil
studying
conditions
poring
over
maps
and
figures
with
the
seer
verifying
estimates
listening
to
and
taking
part
in
the
many
councils
of
the
leaders
but
not
once
did
anyone
catch
a
hint
of
what
was
going
on
behind
those
expressionless
blue
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
everything
without
effort
and
to
be
incapable
of
expressing
the
emotions
of
the
soul
within
to
the
men
he
was
the
visible
representative
of
that
invisible
power
that
willed
their
going
forth
he
was
capital
money
business
incarnate
they
set
him
apart
as
one
not
of
their
world
in
his
presence
laughter
was
hushed
jests
were
unspoken
silently
they
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
when
he
conversed
with
them
they
answered
thoughtfully
in
subdued
tones
seeming
to
feel
that
their
words
were
received
by
one
who
placed
upon
them
values
filled
as
these
men
were
with
the
enthusiasm
of
their
work
they
were
never
unconscious
of
the
knowledge
that
but
for
the
power
represented
by
jefferson
worth
their
work
would
be
impossible
small
wonder
then
that
there
was
consternation
in
the
headquarters
camp
that
night
when
pat
appeared
hat
in
hand
before
the
company
of
leaders
in
the
seer
office

i
beg
yer
pardon
sorr
what
is
it
pat
asked
the
seer
and
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
burly
irishman
whose
face
and
voice
as
well
as
his
presence
at
that
hour
betrayed
some
unusual
incident

the
seer
you
know
how
careful
he
is
what
do
you
think
abe
before
abe
could
answer
a
mexican
ran
up
and
pat

into

tent
by
the
neck

senor
worth
he
is
not
come
i
think
he
is
gone
before
the
mexican
finished
speaking
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
and
he
was
alone
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
a
flash
of
his
white
teeth
he
turned
leisurely
to
follow
saying
half
aloud
it
is
all
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
senor
worth
maybe
so
you
come
back
maybe
this
time
not
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
into
the
black
vault
of
the
night
then
with
another
shrug
retired
to
his
blanket
to
sleep
abe
lee
was
first
to
reach
the
corral
where
texas
joe
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
was
examining
worth
horse
no
word
was
exchanged
between
them
while
the
surveyor
in
turn
looked
carefully
over
the
animal
the
others
coming
up
stood
silent
a
little
apart
waiting
for
the
word
of
these
two
what
do
you
make
of
it
abe
asked
the
seer
when
the
long
surveyor
turned
toward
him
deliberately
rolling
a
cigarette
abe
answered
from
a
cloud
of
smoke
he
is
left
afoot
too
far
out
to
walk
in
likely
we
go
for
him
in
the
morning
a
startled
exclamation
came
from
willard
holmes
but
no
one
heeded
as
the
surveyor
turned
to
texas
joe
how
do
you
figure
it
tex
the
same
came
the
laconic
answer
this
here
cayuse
was
broke
to
stand
he
must
have
been
tied
somewheres
the
reins
are
busted
he
pointed
to
the
pieces
of
leather
hanging
from
the
bit
the
canteen
is
gone
jefferson
worth
is
too
old
a
hand
on
the
desert
to
leave
it
on
the
horse
he
likely
tied
the
pony
to
a
bush
and
went
to
climb
a
hill
or
something
hawss
breaks
loose
and
pulls
for
home
it
happened
a
good
way
out
the
pony
pretty
well
tired
which
he
travelin
light
if
worth
had
ridden
some
distance
before
it
happened
an
if
he
was
nearer
the
pony
would
have
been
in
earlier
he
likely
show
us
a
smoke
in
the
morning
and
even
if
he
do
it
be
easy
to
trail
him
there
ai
no
wind
will
i
go
sir
he
looked
at
the
chief
yes
you
and
abe
do
you
think
abe
assented
and
the
men
turned
toward
the
tents
while
texas
led
the
tired
horse
away
the
new
york
engineer
approached
the
chief
do
i
understand
sir
that
you
propose
to
do
nothing
until
morning
the
seer
faced
him
there
is
nothing
to
do
holmes
he
said
simply
willard
holmes
was
amazed
at
the
man
apparent
unconcern
nothing
to
do
he
exclaimed
why
do
you
arouse
the
men
and
send
them
in
every
direction
to
search
why
man
do
you
realize
the
situation
worth
may
be
hurt
he
may
even
be
dying
alone
out
there
i
protest
it
monstrous
it
cowardly
inhuman
to
do
nothing
the
company
attracted
by
the
loud
words
paused
abe
lee
standing
beside
his
chief
rolled
another
cigarette
while
the
engineer
was
speaking
the
seer
answered
patiently
but
holmes
we
could
accomplish
nothing
by
such
a
search
as
you
suggest
the
territory
is
too
large
to
cover
with
a
hundred
times
the
number
of
men
we
have
in
camp
at
daylight
when
they
can
follow
his
trail
abe
and
tex
will
ride
to
him
as
fast
as
their
horses
can
go
granting
that
the
worst
you
suggest
may
be
true
our
plan
is
the
only
sane
way
but
i
protest
sir
you
should
make
the
attempt
i
will
not
submit
to
idly
doing
nothing
while
a
life
is
in
danger
particularly
that
of
a
man
like
worth
i
shall
go
alone
if
no
one
will
help
me
and
he
straightened
himself
haughtily
i
shall
report
this
to
greenfield
and
the
men
interested
with
him
in
this
work
at
the
last
words
one
of
those
rare
changes
swept
over
the
big
engineer
and
the
witnesses
saw
a
side
of
the
chief
nature
that
was
seldom
revealed
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
face
hardened
as
he
burst
forth
in
tones
that
startled
his
hearers
report
me
you
report
and
be
damned
sir
i
was
old
at
this
work
when
you
were
a
sucking
babe
these
men
were
learning
the
desert
when
you
were
attending
a
fashionable
dancing
school
why
you
damned
tenderfoot
you
could
find
your
way
five
hundred
yards
in
this
country
without
a
guide
or
a
compass
now
sir
i
running
this
outfit
and
if
you
have
any
protests
against
my
cowardly
inhumanity
i
advise
you
to
smother
them
in
your
manly
breast
or
by
hell
i
ship
you
out
on
the
first
wagon
morning
and
let
you
report
to
greenfield
that
you
were
fired
because
you
did
know
your
work
yourself
and
intelligence
enough
to
listen
to
those
who
did
the
chief
paused
for
breath
and
willard
holmes
whose
experience
with
large
corporations
was
expected
to
make
him
peculiarly
valuable
to
the
capitalists
who
sent
him
out
turned
away
with
what
dignity
he
could
command
howly
mither
came
a
hoarse
whisper
from
pat
to
abe
i
made
sure
the
poor
bhoy
wud
shrivel
up
sich
a
witherin
blistherin
tongue
wud
scorch
the
hide
av
the
owld
divil
himsilf
he
looked
admiringly
after
the
seer
d
think
now
that
the
poor
lad
will
be
afther
tacklin
the
job
alone
like
he
said
sure
ut
nerve
he
has
all
right
but
he
lacks
judgment
yes
he
has
the
nerve
all
right
returned
abe
slowly
and
better
keep
an
eye
on
him
tell
tex
willard
holmes
knew
that
he
owed
his
chief
an
apology
and
he
promised
himself
to
make
it
in
the
morning
but
neither
the
explanation
of
the
seer
nor
the
bitter
humiliation
that
he
had
brought
upon
himself
could
turn
his
thoughts
from
worth
alone
on
the
desert
to
sleep
was
impossible
the
banker
might
be
as
he
tossed
in
his
blankets
the
engineer
pictured
to
himself
a
hundred
things
that
might
have
happened
to
barbara
father
it
was
some
two
hours
later
when
pat
touched
abe
lee
on
the
shoulder
all
right
pat
said
the
surveyor
fully
awake
and
in
possession
of
all
his
senses
in
an
instant
there
a
light
bobbin
off
into
nowhere
an
the
lad
blankets
are
impty
fifteen
minutes
later
a
quiet
voice
within
three
feet
of
willard
holmes
asked
shall
i
go
with
you
sir
the
eastern
man
jumped
like
a
nervous
woman
he
had
not
heard
the
approach
of
the
surveyor
who
walked
with
the
step
of
an
indian
i
could
sleep
he
explained
i
thought
i
would
follow
the
tracks
a
little
way
out
at
least
he
may
not
be
so
far
away
as
you
think
after
abe
had
taken
time
to
make
his
cigarette
he
spoke
meditatively
worth
rode
a
horse
i
understand
that
returned
the
man
with
the
lantern
tartly
i
saw
him
go
this
morning
and
i
saw
the
horse
this
is
the
track
from
another
cloud
of
smoke
came
the
quiet
respectful
answer
but
this
is
a
mule
track
holmes
it
is
manuel
ramirez
mule
see
he
has
a
broken
shoe
on
the
off
i
noticed
it
yesterday
when
i
sent
manuel
to
hunt
a
water
hole
besides
worth
rode
northeast
not
in
this
direction
chapter
ix
the
master
passion
good
business
when
jefferson
worth
left
headquarters
camp
that
morning
his
purpose
was
to
ride
over
a
part
of
the
territory
lying
southeast
of
the
old
san
felipe
trail
between
the
sand
hills
and
the
old
he
had
covered
practically
all
of
the
land
on
the
western
side
of
the
ancient
from
the
delta
dam
at
the
southern
end
north
to
the
lowest
point
in
the
basin
and
southward
again
on
the
eastern
side
as
far
as
the
old
trail
there
remained
for
him
to
see
only
this
section
in
the
southeast
it
was
nearly
noon
when
the
banker
from
a
slight
elevation
that
afforded
him
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
recognized
the
group
of
sand
hills
and
by
the
general
course
of
dry
river
distinguished
the
spot
where
the
san
felipe
trail
crosses
the
deep
arroyo
occupied
with
his
thoughts
he
had
ridden
farther
from
camp
than
he
had
realized
he
should
turn
back
but
the
distant
scene
of
the
desert
tragedy
called
him
he
became
possessed
of
a
desire
to
visit
once
more
the
spot
that
was
so
closely
associated
with
the
child
who
had
so
strangely
come
into
his
life
and
whom
he
loved
as
his
own
daughter
an
hour
later
he
dismounted
to
stand
beside
the
water
hole
where
with
his
companions
he
had
found
the
dead
woman
with
the
empty
canteen
by
her
side
the
incidents
of
that
hour
were
as
vivid
in
the
memory
as
if
it
had
all
happened
only
the
day
before
he
remembered
how
texas
joe
had
lifted
the
canteen
and
inverting
it
had
held
out
to
them
his
finger
moistened
with
the
last
drop
of
water
in
the
vessel
and
how
he
and
his
companions
standing
by
the
dead
body
of
the
woman
had
turned
to
each
other
in
startled
awe
at
the
coyotes
ghostly
call
in
the
dusk
he
heard
again
with
thrilling
clearness
the
baby
plaintive
voice
mamma
mamma
barba
wants
drink
please
bring
drink
mamma
barba
going
a
short
way
up
the
wash
he
stood
with
uncovered
head
on
the
very
spot
where
he
had
knelt
with
hands
before
the
baby
girl
who
crouching
under
the
high
bank
shrank
back
from
him
in
fear
he
saw
the
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
and
heard
the
sweet
voice
cry
go
go
go
then
he
saw
the
expression
on
the
little
face
change
as
pat
and
tex
and
the
boy
tried
to
reassure
her
saw
her
hold
up
her
baby
hands
in
full
confidence
to
the
big
engineer
and
felt
again
the
pain
and
humiliation
in
his
heart
why
had
the
baby
instinctively
feared
him
why
had
she
turned
from
him
to
the
seer
why
he
asked
himself
bitterly
had
she
always
feared
him
why
did
she
still
shrink
from
him
for
barbara
did
shrink
from
him
unconsciously
unintentionally
but
to
jefferson
worth
none
the
less
plainly
now
than
when
he
knelt
before
her
that
night
in
the
desert
and
it
hurt
him
now
as
it
had
hurt
him
then
hurt
the
more
perhaps
because
barbara
did
not
know
because
her
attitude
was
instinctive
still
living
over
again
the
incidents
and
emotions
of
that
hour
in
the
desert
night
he
walked
back
to
the
crossing
and
leading
his
horse
climbed
the
little
hill
out
of
the
wash
to
the
spot
where
with
texas
and
pat
he
had
rendered
the
last
possible
service
to
the
unknown
woman
who
had
given
her
life
for
the
life
of
the
child
the
child
that
was
his
but
not
his
long
ago
he
had
marked
the
grave
with
a
simple
headstone
bearing
the
only
name
possible
the
one
word
mother
and
the
date
of
her
death
then
mounting
again
he
rode
swiftly
along
the
old
trail
toward
the
sand
hills
in
the
near
distance
the
great
drifts
in
the
years
that
had
passed
had
been
moved
on
by
the
wind
until
the
wagon
and
all
that
remained
of
the
outfit
were
now
hidden
somewhere
deep
in
its
heart
but
the
general
form
of
the
sand
hill
was
still
the
same
dismounting
worth
tied
his
horse
to
a
scraggly
mesquite
and
taking
his
canteen
from
the
saddle
climbed
laboriously
up
the
steep
sandy
slope
he
would
look
over
the
country
from
that
point
and
then
make
straight
for
camp
for
it
was
getting
well
on
in
the
afternoon
from
the
top
of
the
hill
he
could
see
the
wide
reaches
of
the
king
basin
desert
sweeping
away
on
every
side
at
his
feet
the
bare
sand
hills
themselves
lay
like
huge
rolling
drifts
of
tawny
snow
glistening
in
the
sunlight
with
a
blinding
glare
beyond
these
were
the
gray
and
green
of
mesquite
and
greasewood
with
the
dun
earth
showing
here
and
there
in
ragged
patches
still
farther
away
the
detail
of
hill
and
hummock
and
bush
and
patch
was
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
scene
while
the
dull
tones
of
gray
and
green
and
brown
were
with
the
tints
of
the
distance
until
to
the
eyes
the
nearer
plain
became
an
island
surrounded
on
every
side
by
a
mighty
sea
that
broke
only
at
the
foot
of
the
purple
mountain
wall
the
work
of
the
expedition
was
nearly
finished
the
banker
knew
now
from
the
results
of
the
survey
and
from
his
own
careful
observations
and
estimates
that
the
seer
dream
was
not
only
possible
from
an
engineering
point
of
view
but
from
the
careful
standpoint
would
justify
a
large
investment
lying
within
the
lines
of
the
ancient
beach
and
thus
below
the
level
of
the
great
river
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
equal
in
richness
of
the
soil
to
the
famous
delta
lands
of
the
nile
the
bringing
of
the
water
from
the
river
and
its
distribution
through
a
system
of
canals
and
ditches
while
a
work
of
great
magnitude
requiring
the
expenditure
of
large
sums
of
money
was
as
an
engineering
problem
comparatively
simple
as
jefferson
worth
gazed
at
the
wonderful
scene
a
vision
of
the
changes
that
were
to
come
to
that
land
passed
before
him
he
saw
first
following
the
nearly
finished
work
of
the
engineers
an
army
of
men
beginning
at
the
river
and
pushing
out
into
the
desert
with
their
canals
bringing
with
them
the
water
soon
with
the
coming
of
the
water
would
begin
the
coming
of
the
settlers
hummocks
would
be
leveled
washes
and
arroyos
filled
ditches
would
be
made
to
the
company
canals
and
in
place
of
the
thin
growth
of
desert
vegetation
with
the
ragged
patches
of
dun
earth
would
come
great
fields
of
luxuriant
alfalfa
billowing
acres
of
grain
with
miles
upon
miles
of
orchards
vineyards
and
groves
the
fierce
desert
life
would
give
way
to
the
herds
and
flocks
and
the
home
life
of
the
farmer
the
railroad
would
stretch
its
steel
strength
into
this
new
world
towns
and
cities
would
come
to
be
where
now
was
only
solitude
and
desolation
and
out
from
this
treasure
house
vast
wealth
would
pour
to
enrich
the
peoples
of
the
earth
the
wealth
of
an
empire
lay
in
that
land
under
the
banker
eye
and
capital
held
the
key
but
while
the
work
of
the
engineers
was
simple
it
would
be
a
great
work
and
it
was
the
magnitude
of
the
enterprise
and
the
consequent
requirement
of
large
sums
of
money
that
gave
capital
its
opportunity
without
water
the
desert
was
worthless
with
water
the
productive
possibilities
of
that
great
territory
were
enormous
without
capital
the
water
could
not
be
had
therefore
capital
was
master
of
the
situation
and
by
controlling
the
water
could
exact
royal
tribute
from
the
wealth
of
the
land
knowing
james
greenfield
and
his
business
associates
as
he
knew
them
familiar
with
their
operations
as
he
was
and
knowing
that
they
represented
the
power
of

realized
that
they
would
plan
to
share
in
every
dollar
of
wealth
that
the
king
basin
lands
could
be
made
to
produce
already
his
trained
mind
saw
how
easily
with
the
vast
power
in
their
hands
this
could
be
brought
about
and
these
men
recognizing
his
peculiar
value
in
such
an
enterprise
as
this
wanted
him
to
join
them
it
was
a
triumphant
moment
in
the
life
and
business
career
of
the
western
banker
the
culmination
of
long
hard
years
of
unceasing
toil
of
unfaltering
devotion
to
business
of
struggle
and
disappointments
of
small
victories
and
steady
advance
gained
at
the
cost
of
sacrifice
and
hard
fighting
this
proposed
alliance
with
the
great
eastern
capitalists
opened
the
door
and
invited
him
into
the
company
of
the
real
leaders
of
the
financial
world
as
one
of
the
powerful
corporation
that
would
literally
hold
the
life
of
the
future
king
basin
in
its
hand
the
multitudes
of
toilers
who
would
come
to
reclaim
the
desert
would
be
forced
to
toil
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
him
a
part
of
every
dollar
of
the
millions
that
would
be
taken
from
that
treasury
by
the
labor
of
the
people
would
go
to
enrich
him
the
financier
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
sound
he
turned
to
see
his
horse
tugging
at
the
bridle
reins
snorting
in
fear
the
man
started
quickly
down
the
hill
but
before
he
could
cover
half
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
his
mount
the
frightened
animal
broke
the
reins
and
wheeling
about
disappeared
down
the
trail
on
a
wild
run
at
the
same
instant
a
coyote
trotted
leisurely
out
from
under
the
lee
of
the
sand
drift
and
with
a
side
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
banker
slipped
around
the
point
of
the
next
low
ridge
the
man
knew
that
to
catch
his
horse
would
be
impossible
the
animal
would
not
stop
until
he
reached
his
companions
at
the
in
camp
he
knew
also
that
to
attempt
to
find
his
way
to
headquarters
such
a
distance
and
on
foot
with
night
so
near
at
hand
would
be
worse
than
folly
he
would
only
exhaust
his
strength
and
make
it
harder
for
his
friends
to
find
him
before
his
water
which
could
not
last
another
day
should
give
out
someone
he
knew
would
take
his
trail
in
the
morning
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
to
wait
to
wait
alone
in
the
heart
of
this
silent
waiting
land
somewhere
in
those
forgotten
ages
that
went
into
the
making
of
the
king
basin
desert
a
company
of
citizens
of
the
land
moved
by
that
master
passion
good
business
found
their
way
to
the
banks
of
the
colorado
in
time
good
business
led
them
to
build
their
pueblos
and
to
cultivate
their
fields
by
irrigation
with
water
from
the
river
and
erect
their
rude
altars
to
their
now
gods
driven
by
the
same
passion
that
drove
the
indians
the
emigrant
wagons
moved
toward
the
new
gold
country
and
some
financial
genius
saw
good
business
at
the
near
the
site
of
the
ancient
city
at
first
it
was
no
more
than
a
ferry
but
soon
others
with
eyes
for
profit
established
a
trading
point
where
the
overland
voyagers
could
replenish
their
stock
of
supplies
sure
to
be
low
after
the
hundreds
of
miles
across
the
wide
plains
then
also
in
obedience
to
good
business
pleasures
heard
the
call
saloons
gambling
houses
and
dance
halls
appeared
and
for
profit
the
joys
of
civilization
arrived
in
the
savage
land
good

sent
the
prospectors
who
found
the
mines
the
capital
that
developed
them
and
the
laborers
who
dug
the
good
business
sent
the

barons
and
their
cowboys
sent

in
the
fulness
of

jefferson
worth
of
old
new
england
puritan
stock
worth
had
come
through
the
hard
life
of
a
poor
farm
boy
with
two
dominant
elements
in
his
character
an
almost
instinct
for
good
business
inherited
no
doubt
and
an
instinct
also
inherited
for
religion
the
instinct
for
trade
from
much
cultivation
had
waxed
strong
and
stronger
with
the
years
the
religion
that
he
had
from
his
forefathers
was
become
little
more
than
a
superstition
it
was
his
genius
for
business
that
led
him
in
his
young
manhood
to
leave
the
farm
and
it
was
inevitable
that
from
making
money
he
should
come
to
making
money
make
more
money
it
was
the
other
dominant
element
in
his
character
that
kept
him
scrupulously
honest
scrupulously
moral
besides
this
honesty
and
morality
were
also
good
business
seeking
always
larger
opportunities
for
the
employment
of
his
small
financial
strength
worth
established
the
pioneer
bank
later
as
he
had
foreseen
the
same
master
passion
brought
the
great
railroad
with
still
larger
opportunities
for
his
money
to
make
more
money
and
now
the
same
master
passion
that
had
driven
the
indian
the
emigrant
the
miner
the
cowman
the
banker
and
the
railroad
was
driving
the
eastern
capitalists
to
spend
their
moneyed
strength
in
the
reclamation
of
the
king
basin
desert
it
was
good
business
that
led
greenfield
and
his
friends
to
seek
the
of
the
western
financier
it
was
good
business
that
called
to
jefferson
worth
now
as
he
saw
the
immense
possibilities
of
the
land
as
truly
as
the
ages
had
made
the
barren
desert
with
its
hard
thirsty
life
the
ages
had
produced
jefferson
worth
a
carefully
perfected
money
making
machine
as
silent
hard
and
lonely
as
the
desert
itself
with
apparently
no
vices
no
passions
no
mistakes
no
failures
his
only
relation
to
his
was
a
business
relation
with
his
almost
supernatural
ability
to
foresee
to
measure
to
weigh
and
judge
with
his
cold
face
and
his
manner
of
considering
carefully
every
word
and
of
placing
a
value
upon
every
trivial
incident
he
was
respected
feared
trusted
even
admired
and
that
was
all
no
not
all
by
those
who
were
forced
through
circumstances
business
circumstances
to
contribute
to
his
prosperity
and
financial
success
he
was
hated
such
is
the
unreasonableness
of
human
kind
business
to
this
man
as
to
many
of
his
kind
was
not
the
mean
sordid
grasping
and
hoarding
of
money
it
was
his
profession
but
it
was
even
more
than
a
profession
it
was
the
expression
of
his
genius
still
more
it
was
through
him
the
expression
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
the
expression
of
the
master
passion
that
in
all
ages
had
wrought
in
the
making
of
the
race
he
looked
upon
a
successful
deal
as
a
good
surgeon
looks
upon
a
successful
operation
as
an
architect
upon
the
completion
of
a
building
or
an
artist
upon
his
finished
picture
but
to
a
greater
degree
than
to
artist
or
surgeon
the
success
of
his
work
was
measured
by
the
accumulation
of
dollars
apart
from
his
work
he
valued
the
money
received
from
his
operations
no
more
than
the
surgeon
his
fee
the
artist
his
price
the
work
itself
was
his
passion
because
dollars
were
the
tools
of
his
craft
he
was
careful
of
them
the
more
he
succeeded
the
more
power
he
gained
for
greater
success
but
extremely
simple
in
his
tastes
lacking
with
his
lack
of
education
knowledge
of
the
more
costly
luxuries
of
life
with
the
habits
of
an
ascetic
jefferson
worth
could
not
evidence
his
success
and
success
hidden
and
unknown
loses
its
power
to
reward
it
is
not
enough
for
the
engineer
to
run
his
locomotive
he
must
have
train
loads
of
goods
and
passengers
to
carry
to
some
objective
point
it
is
not
enough
for
the
captain
to
have
command
of
his
ship
he
must
have
a
port
self
to
jefferson
worth
meant
little
his
nature
demanded
so
little
nor
could
worth
in
this
fill
the
need
in
her
life
for
her
nature
was
as
simple
as
his
own
but
a
child
whose
life
could
be
part
of
his
life
filling
out
supplementing
and
complementing
his
own
nature
a
child
who
dependent
upon
him
should
have
all
the
training
that
he
lacked
who
should
share
his
success
and
for
whom
he
could
plan
to
succeed
a
child
an
heir
would
fill
the
blank
in
his
empty
career
for
a
brief
time
he
had
looked
forward
to
a
child
of
his
own
blood
then
the
death
of
the
baby
and
the
ill
health
of
his
wife
had
left
him
hopeless
he
continued
his
work
because
he
knew
no
life
apart
from
his
work
then
came
the
little
girl
so
strangely
the
gift
of
the
desert
the
banker
mind
trained
to
act
quickly
had
grasped
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
instantly
as
he
ran
with
his
companions
to
answer
the
call
of
that
childish
voice
from
the
moment
when
he
knelt
with
outstretched
hands
and
pleading
words
before
little
barbara
he
had
never
ceased
trying
to
win
her
worth
knowing
that
she
could
not
be
with
him
many
years
had
said
you
need
her
jeff
and
he
did
need
her
but
jefferson
worth
knew
that
barbara
was
not
his
she
shrank
from
him
as
instinctively
and
unconsciously
as
she
had
drawn
back
that
night
of
her
mother
death
when
he
knelt
before
her
in
the
desert
as
she
had
turned
to
the
seer
then
she
turned
from
the
banker
now
and
now
far
more
than
then
his
lonely
heart
hungered
for
her
for
with
the
years
his
need
of
her
had
grown
envied
of
foolish
men
as
men
so
foolishly
envy
his
class
the
banker
knew
himself
to
be
destitute
an
object
of
their
pity
the
poorest
mexican
in
his
adobe
hut
with
his
laughing
children
was
more
wealthy
than
he
jefferson
worth
that
afternoon
on
the
very
scene
of
the
tragedy
that
had
given
barbara
to
him
realized
that
in
the
land
before
him
he
faced
the
greatest
opportunity
of
his
business
career
he
realized
also
that
he
was
as
much
alone
in
his
life
as
he
was
alone
in
the
silent
barren
waste
that
surrounded
him
would
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
which
had
given
him
the
child
that
was
not
his
child
give
him
wealth
that
still
never
could
be
his
at
last
from
his
place
on
the
sand
drift
that
held
the
secret
of
barbara
life
he
saw
the
sun
as
it
appeared
to
rest
for
a
moment
on
the
western
wall
before
plunging
down
into
the
world
on
the
other
side
watching
he
saw
the
purple
of
the
hills
deepen
and
deepen
and
the
wondrous
light
on
the
wide
sea
of
colors
fade
slowly
out
as
the
colors
themselves
paled
and
grew
dim
in
the
misty
dusk
of
the
coming
night
slowly
the
twilight
sky
grew
dark
and
into
the
velvet
plain
above
came
the
heavenly
flocks
until
their
number
was
past
counting
save
by
him
who
leadeth
them
in
their
fields
against
the
last
lingering
light
in
the
west
that
marked
where
the
day
had
gone
the
mountains
lifted
their
vast
bulk
in
solemn
grandeur
as
if
to
bar
forever
the
coming
of
another
day
closing
about
him
on
every
hand
coming
dreadfully
nearer
and
nearer
the
black
walls
of
darkness
shut
him
in
in
the
cool
mysterious
breath
of
the
desert
in
the
grotesque
fantastic
nearby
shapes
and
monstrous
forms
of
the
sand
dunes
in
the
mysterious
phantom
voices
that
whispered
in
the
dark
jefferson
worth
felt
the
close
approach
of
the
spirit
of
the
land
the
calling
of
the
waiting
land
the
silent
menace
the
voiceless
threat
the
whispered
promise
and
there
alone
held
close
in
the
hollow
of
god
hand
as
the
long
hours
of
the
night
passed
the
spirit
of
the
man
puritan
fathers
stirred
within
him
in
the
silent
naked
heart
of
the
desert
that
knowing
no
hand
but
the
hand
of
its
creator
seemed
to
hold
in
its
hushed
mysteriousness
the
ages
of
a
past
eternity
he
felt
his
life
to
be
but
a
little
thing
beside
the
awful
forces
that
made
themselves
felt
in
the
spirit
of
barbara
desert
the
might
of
capital
became
small
and
trivial
sensing
the
dreadful
power
that
had
wrought
to
make
that
land
he
shrank
within
himself
he
was
afraid
he
marveled
that
he
had
dared
dream
of
forcing
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
to
contribute
to
his
gains
and
so
at
last
it
was
given
him
to
know
why
barbara
instinctively
shrank
from
him
in
fear
with
the
coming
of
the
day
the
banker
went
a
little
way
back
on
the
trail
where
the
vegetation
was
not
entirely
covered
by
the
drifting
sand
and
there
gathered
materials
for
a
fire
later
when
he
judged
his
friends
would
be
in
sight
he
fired
the
pile
and
watching
the
tall
thick
column
of
smoke
ascend
awaited
the
answer
in
a
little
while
it
came
faint
and
far
away
the
report
of
texas
soon
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
calling
loudly
and
following
his
answer
the
swift
of
galloping
horses
and
tex
and
abe
leading
another
horse
appeared
but
the
jefferson
worth
who
rode
back
to
camp
with
his
friends
there
to
be
greeted
and
congratulated
by
the
party
was
not
the
same
jefferson
worth
who
had
left
camp
the
morning
before
though
no
one
congratulated
him
because
of
that
it
was
three
weeks
later
when
a
portly
gentleman
entered
the
pioneer
bank
in
rubio
city
and
asked
of
the
teller
is
worth
in
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
looked
through
his
grated
window
at
the
speaker
with
unusual
interest
and
in
the
teller
voice
there
was
a
shade
of
unusual
deference
as
he
replied
yes
sir
tell
him
that
greenfield
is
here
at
the
magic
of
that
name
every
man
in
the
bank
within
sound
of
the
speaker
voice
lifted
his
head
and
turned
toward
the
face
at
the
window
yes
sir
come
this
way
sir
a
door
in
the
partition
opened
and
the
visitor
was
admitted
to
the
sacred
precincts
behind
the
gratings
the
bars
and
the
plate
glass
as
he
moved
down
the
room
past
counters
and
desks
every
eye
followed
him
and
there
was
an
electrical
hush
in
the
atmosphere
like
the
hush
that
marks
the
massing
of
the
forces
in
nature
before
a
conflict
of
the
elements
jefferson
worth
looked
up
as
the
imposing
figure
of
the
great
financier
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
his
room
and
at
the
name
of
james
greenfield
carefully
pushed
back
the
papers
he
had
been
considering
and
rose
the
movement
slight
as
it
was
was
as
though
he
cleared
his
decks
for
action
the
clerk
withdrawing
carefully
closed
the
door
the
two
men
shook
hands
with
much
the
air
of
two
wrestlers
meeting
for
a
bout
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
each
knew
that
in
the
silence
he
was
being
measured
estimated
searched
for
his
weakness
and
his
strength
and
each
gave
to
the
other
this
opportunity
as
his
right
no
time
was
wasted
in
idle
preliminaries
these
men
knew
the
value
of
time
no
formal
words
expressing
pleasure
at
the
meeting
were
spoken
they
tacitly
accepted
the
fact
that
pleasure
had
not
called
them
together
james
greenfield
was
a
fair
representative
of
his
class
his
full
face
with
carefully
clipped
gray
mustache
bright
blue
eyes
and
gray
hair
was
the
calmly
alert
thoughtful
face
of
power
not
the
face
of
one
who
does
things
but
of
one
who
causes
things
to
be
done
not
the
face
of
one
who
is
himself
powerful
but
of
one
who
controls
and
directs
power
such
a
face
as
you
may
see
leaning
from
the
cab
of
a
great
locomotive
that
pulls
the
overland
limited
or
looking
down
at
you
from
the
bridge
of
the
ocean
liner
it
was
courageous
but
with
a
courage
not
personal
a
courage
born
rather
of
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
strength
and
duty
of
every
bolt
rivet
and
lever
of
the
machine
under
his
hand
it
was
confident
not
in
its
own
strength
but
in
the
strength
that
it
ruled
and
directed
jefferson
worth
motioned
toward
a
chair
at
the
end
of
his
desk
and
seated
himself
the
man
from
the
east
found
himself
forced
to
make
the
opening
worth
he
said
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
your
attitude
toward
our
company
we
do
not
see
why
you
decline
our
proposition
your
own
report
gives
every
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
accept
and
you
suggest
no
reason
at
all
for
declining
frankly
it
looks
strange
to
us
and
i
have
come
out
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
over
the
matter
and
to
see
if
we
could
not
persuade
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
or
at
least
to
learn
your
reasons
for
refusing
to
go
in
with
us
your
report
and
your
answer
to
our
proposition
are
so
conflicting
that
we
feel
we
have
a
right
to
some
definite
reason
for
your
unexpected
decision
as
he
spoke
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
tried
in
vain
to
see
behind
the
face
of
the
man
in
the
revolving
chair
his
failure
only
excited
his
admiration
and
respect
instinctively
he
recognized
the
genius
before
him
and
his
desire
to
add
this
strength
to
his
forces
increased
my
report
was
satisfactory
the
words
were
absolutely
colorless
very
it
was
exactly
what
we
wanted
with
your
opinion
confirming
our
engineer
statements
we
felt
safe
to
go
ahead
with
the
organization
of
the
company
and
have
already
set
the
wheels
moving
toward
actual
work
it
is
because
you
so
unhesitatingly
and
so
strongly
commend
the
project
as
warranting
our
investment
that
we
can
not
understand
your
refusal
to
share
the
profits
of
our
enterprise
he
paused
for
an
answer
but
was
forced
to
continue
let
me
explain
more
fully
than
i
could
outline
in
my
letter
just
what
we
propose
doing
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
worth
will
not
confine
its
operations
simply
to
furnishing
water
for
the
reclamation
and
development
of
these
lands
that
is
no
more
than
the
beginning
the
basis
of
our
operations
with
the
settlement
and
improvement
of
the
country
will
come
many
other
openings
for
profitable
investments
townsites
transportation
lines
telephones
electric
power
banking
and
all
that
you
understand
our
connections
and
resources
make
it
possible
for
us
to
finance
any
industry
or
operation
that
promises
attractive
returns
while
our
position
as
the
originators
of
the
whole
king
basin
movement
and
the
owners
of
the
irrigation
system
will
give
us
tremendous
advantage
over
any
outside
capital
that
may
attempt
to
come
in
later
and
will
make
competition
practically
impossible
i
figured
that
was
the
way
you
would
do
it
was
the
unemotional
reply
more
than
ever
james
greenfield
wanted
this
man
he
considered
carefully
a
few
minutes
with
no
help
from
jefferson
worth
then
tried
again
if
you
feel
that
our
proposition
to
you
is
not
liberal
enough
worth
i
am
prepared
to
double
our
offer
if
the
financier
from
new
york
thought
to
startle
this
little
western
banker
with
a
proposal
that
was
more
than
princely
he
failed
his
words
seemed
to
have
no
effect
it
was
as
though
he
talked
to
a
marble
figure
of
a
man
i
appreciate
your
proposition
but
must
decline
it
may
i
ask
your
reason
sir
i
must
decline
to
give
any
the
other
arose
the
light
of
battle
in
his
eyes
for
to
james
greenfield
mind
there
could
be
only
one
possible
meaning
in
the
answer
that
is
of
course
your
privilege
worth
he
said
coldly
and
then
with
the
weight
of
conscious
power
he
added
but
tell
you
this
sir
if
you
think
you
can
enter
the
king
basin
in
opposition
to
our
company
you
making
the
mistake
of
your
life
smash
you
with
your
limited
resources
so
flat
that
you
be
glad
for
a
chance
to
make
the
price
of
a
meal
good
day
sir
good
day
before
the
great
capitalist
was
out
of
the
building
jefferson
worth
was
bending
over
the
papers
on
his
desk
again
as
though
declining
to
accept
flattering
offers
from
gigantic
corporations
was
an
hourly
occurrence
chapter
barbara
love
for
the
seer
jefferson
worth
had
not
proceeded
far
with
the
work
before
him
after
james
greenfield
left
when
he
was
again
interrupted
this
time
it
was
the
voice
of
barbara
in
the
other
room
the
banker
lifted
his
head
quickly
again
he
pushed
his
papers
from
him
but
now
the
movement
seemed
to
indicate
weariness
and
uncertainty
rather
than
readiness
for
action
his
head
dropped
forward
his
thin
fingers
nervously
tapped
the
arms
of
his
chair
when
the
girl
step
sounded
at
the
door
he
looked
up
the
fraction
of
a
second
before
she
appeared
i
do
want
to
disturb
you
father
but
they
told
me
that
that
big
man
just
going
out
was
greenfield
is
he
did
he
come
all
the
way
from
new
york
to
see
you
he
came
in
here
to
see
me
said
jefferson
worth
exactly
and
the
work
he
says
they
have
already
started
the
wheels
to
moving
and
you
daddy
you
jefferson
worth
arose
and
carefully
closed
the
door
then
silently
indicating
the
chair
at
the
end
of
his
desk
he
resumed
his
seat
as
barbara
looked
into
that
face
the
eager
expectant
light
in
her
brown
eyes
died
out
and
a
look
of
questioning
doubt
came
she
seemed
to
shrink
back
from
him
almost
as
she
had
turned
away
that
first
time
in
the
desert
if
jefferson
worth
felt
that
look
his
face
gave
no
sign
only
those
thin
nervous
fingers
were
lifted
to
caress
his
chin
are
you
are
you
going
to
help
daddy
will
you
join
company
still
the
man
was
silent
and
the
girl
watching
wondered
what
was
going
on
behind
that
gray
mask
what
questions
were
being
weighed
and
considered
at
last
he
spoke
one
cold
word
why
barbara
flushed
because
she
answered
carefully
because
it
is
such
a
great
work
you
could
do
so
much
more
than
simply
make
money
that
is
as
you
and
the
seer
see
it
but
father
it
a
great
work
is
it
to
change
the
desert
into
a
land
of
farms
and
homes
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
do
you
think
that
greenfield
and
his
crowd
are
going
into
this
scheme
because
it
is
a
great
thing
for
the
people
but
do
even
capitalists
sometimes
undertake
a
great
work
just
because
it
is
great
and
because
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
through
years
and
years
to
come
will
be
benefited
even
though
the
men
themselves
do
not
make
so
awfully
much
money
if
jefferson
worth
felt
her
unconscious
insinuation
his
face
gave
no
sign
carefully
he
listened
with
his
manner
of
considering
and
weighing
every
word
while
to
barbara
his
mind
seemed
to
be
reaching
out
on
every
side
or
running
far
into
the
future
when
he
answered
his
words
were
carefully
exact
capitalists
as
individuals
might
and
do
spend
millions
in
projects
from
which
they
personally
expect
no
returns
but
does
do
such
things
anything
that
capital
as
goes
into
must
be
purely
a
business
proposition
if
anything
like
sentiment
entered
into
it
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
whole
matter
barbara
moved
uneasily
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
why
she
said
there
was
a
shade
of
color
now
in
the
banker
voice
as
he
explained
by
asking
how
long
do
you
think
this
bank
could
exist
if
we
made
loans
to
tom
dick
and
harry
because
they
needed
help
or
put
money
into
this
and
that
scheme
simply
because
it
was
a
beneficial
thing
how
long
would
it
be
before
we
went
to
smash
but
do
business
men
ever
do
anything
except
to
make
money
capital
as
you
say
ever
consider
the
people
this
bank
is
a
very
substantial
benefit
to
the
people
but
it
can
only
benefit
them
by
doing
business
on
strictly
business
principles
as
an
individual
any
officer
or
stock
holder
can
do
what
he
pleases
for
whatever
reason
moves
him
he
can
burn
his
money
if
he
wants
to
but
as
officers
and
directors
of
this
corporation
we
ca
burn
the
capital
of
the
institution
but
greenfield
and
these
new
york
men
who
have
organized
the
company
are
they
not
careful
financiers
very
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
believe
in
the
seer
and
his
work
or
they
would
furnish
him
the
money
would
they
they
believe
in
the
seer
and
his
work
from
their
standpoint
their
capital
is
invested
for
just
one
purpose
dividends
barbara
sighed
and
moved
impatiently
you
always
make
it
so
hard
to
believe
in
men
father
i
ca
think
that
all
business
men
all
financiers
i
mean
are
so
cold
and
heartless
again
if
jefferson
worth
felt
the
unconscious
implication
in
her
words
he
gave
no
sign
the
banker
was
not
ignorant
of
the
public
sentiment
toward
himself
and
the
men
of
his
class
in
his
profession
he
had
come
to
accept
it
with
the
indifference
of
his
exact
habit
barbara
continued
i
feel
sure
that
greenfield
and
the
men
with
him
are
going
to
furnish
the
money
for
the
seer
to
do
this
work
for
more
than
just
what
they
will
make
out
of
it
i
know
that
holmes
does
and
i
had
hoped
that
you
her
voice
broke
that
you
would
if
only
jefferson
worth
could
have
broken
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
if
he
could
have
laid
aside
that
gray
mask
and
permitted
the
girl
to
look
into
his
hidden
life
perhaps
his
colorless
voice
broke
the
silence
coldly
exact
what
do
you
figure
willard
holmes
is
in
this
thing
for
barbara
face
lighted
up
proudly
he
is
in
the
work
for
the
same
reason
that
the
seer
and
abe
are
because
it
is
such
a
great
work
and
means
so
much
to
the
world
i
know
because
since
he
returned
he
has
talked
to
me
so
much
about
it
when
he
first
came
out
just
at
first
he
did
understand
what
the
work
really
was
but
now
he
understands
it
as
the
seer
sees
it
did
the
seer
send
him
out
here
no
i
believe
greenfield
sent
him
why
i
suppose
they
wanted
an
eastern
man
whom
they
knew
better
than
they
knew
the
seer
to
represent
them
it
would
be
very
natural
it
very
natural
agreed
jefferson
worth
have
you
given
the
company
your
final
answer
father
yes
and
you
you
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
the
reclamation
of
my
desert
i
declined
to
join
the
company
blindly
barbara
made
her
way
out
of
the
building
the
place
with
its
air
of
business
and
suggestions
of
wealth
was
unbearably
hateful
to
her
at
home
she
ordered
her
horse
and
started
for
the
open
country
but
she
did
not
ride
toward
the
desert
she
felt
that
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
the
king
basin
that
day
in
her
father
attitude
toward
the
company
barbara
saw
only
his
seeming
desire
for
selfish
gain
he
had
told
her
so
often
that
only
one
thing
could
justify
an
investment
of
capital
evidently
he
did
not
think
the
king
basin
project
would
pay
she
felt
ashamed
for
him
he
seemed
so
incapable
of
considering
anything
but
profit
nothing
but
profit
the
sure
promise
of
gain
could
move
him
he
believed
in
the
work
he
had
reported
in
favor
of
it
to
the
company
he
knew
that
the
company
was
going
ahead
he
was
willing
enough
that
others
should
do
the
work
she
thought
bitterly
they
might
take
the
risk
it
was
even
likely
that
he
had
some
way
planned
by
which
without
risking
anything
himself
he
would
reap
large
returns
through
their
efforts
she
thought
proudly
of
the
seer
who
had
given
so
many
unpaid
years
to
the
reclamation
work
of
abe
and
his
loyalty
to
the
seer
and
of
willard
holmes
who
was
going
to
give
himself
to
the
work
utterly
sick
at
heart
the
girl
did
not
meet
her
father
at
their
evening
meal
she
could
not
jefferson
worth
ate
alone
and
alone
spent
the
evening
on
the
porch
on
the
way
to
his
room
he
paused
a
moment
at
her
door
he
knocked
softly
so
as
not
to
waken
her
if
she
was
asleep
when
there
was
no
answer
he
stole
quietly
away
but
barbara
was
not
asleep
for
three
days
greenfield
remained
in
rubio
city
on
the
business
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
the
papers
said
in
a
long
article
setting
forth
the
greatness
of
the
work
that
was
to
be
undertaken
in
the
desert
through
the
magnificent
enterprise
of
these
mighty
eastern
capitalists
during
that
time
barbara
had
not
seen
either
the
seer
holmes
or
abe
lee
she
understood
that
they
were
engaged
with
greenfield
she
read
the
glowing
articles
in
the
paper
the
afternoon
of
greenfield
departure
with
a
thrill
of
pride
at
last
it
had
come
the
day
for
which
the
seer
had
hoped
all
these
years
the
dear
old
seer
she
was
a
little
disappointed
that
the
papers
did
not
give
his
name
more
prominence
it
seemed
to
be
all
greenfield
and
the
company
but
after
all
that
did
not
matter
it
was
the
seer
work
the
seer
had
brought
it
about
the
front
gate
clicked
and
barbara
looked
up
from
her
paper
to
see
her
old
friend
coming
up
the
walk
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
something
was
wrong
she
thought
he
was
ill
the
big
form
of
the
engineer
drooped
with
weakness
his
head
dropped
forward
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
and
he
walked
slowly
dragging
his
feet
as
with
great
weariness
with
a
startled
cry
she
ran
to
meet
him
and
as
he
caught
her
hands
in
both
his
own
she
saw
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
and
his
brown
eyes
filled
with
hopeless
pain
he
did
not
speak
leading
him
to
the
shade
of
the
porch
she
brought
forward
his
favorite
chair
he
sank
into
it
as
if
overcome
with
exhaustion
but
attempted
to
smile
his
thanks
what
is
it
are
you
ill
let
me
call
a
doctor
no
no
dear
i
not
sick
it
not
that
i
i
upset
a
bit
that
all
i
be
all
right
in
a
little
while
only
it
was
rather
unexpected
he
turned
his
face
away
as
though
to
hide
something
from
her
what
is
it
ca
you
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
barbara
had
never
seen
the
seer
so
hopeless
they
have
let
me
out
she
did
not
understand
let
you
out
he
bowed
his
head
slowly
yes
the
company
you
know
they
have
appointed
holmes
chief
engineer
in
my
place
she
cried
out
in
indignant
dismay
but
how
could
they
it
is
your
work
all
your
work
you
have
given
years
to
bring
it
before
the
world
they
never
would
have
known
of
the
king
basin
at
all
but
for
you
how
dare
they
they
have
no
right
the
engineer
smiled
i
was
only
an
employe
of
greenfield
and
the
men
who
organized
the
company
you
know
in
their
eyes
my
relation
to
the
work
was
the
same
as
that
of
a
cocopah
indian
laborer
of
course
it
was
understood
in
a
general
way
that
i
was
to
have
some
stock
in
the
company
when
it
was
organized
with
the
chief
engineer
position
at
least
but
there
was
nothing
settled
nothing
could
be
settled
until
the
actual
completion
of
the
survey
you
know
i
never
dreamed
of
this
i
can
see
now
that
it
was
planned
from
the
first
and
that
this
is
what
holmes
came
out
here
for
he
is
a
great
favorite
of
greenfield
and
i
suppose
they
wanted
a
man
of
their
own
kind
to
look
after
their
interests
but
it
hurts
barbara
it
hurts
for
an
hour
he
stayed
with
her
and
she
helped
him
as
such
a
woman
always
helps
but
when
she
would
have
kept
him
for
supper
he
said
no
i
must
find
abe
i
want
to
tell
the
boy
and
have
it
over
you
can
tell
your
father
when
jefferson
worth
learned
from
his
indignant
daughter
of
the
company
action
he
only
said
in
his
precise
way
i
figured
that
would
be
their
first
move
there
was
no
feeling
in
his
voice
or
manner
it
was
the
simple
verification
of
conclusions
already
reached
and
considered
father
cried
barbara
do
you
mean
that
you
expected
the
company
to
put
that
man
holmes
in
the
seer
place
what
reason
was
there
to
expect
anything
else
but
you
never
said
anything
all
the
time
the
seer
was
she
could
not
continue
it
was
maddening
to
think
that
while
she
had
been
dreaming
and
planning
with
the
seer
her
father
had
foreseen
that
their
dreams
would
come
to
nought
if
i
had
you
would
not
have
believed
me
the
words
were
merely
a
calm
emotionless
statement
of
fact
i
told
you
that
the
company
would
act
only
from
a
business
standpoint
suddenly
a
new
phase
of
the
situation
flashed
upon
barbara
controlling
her
emotions
and
searching
her
father
face
she
asked
daddy
tell
me
please
was
it
because
you
saw
this
that
you
refused
to
join
the
company
jefferson
worth
considered
then
with
marked
caution
answered
that
was
part
of
the
reason
i
think
i
begin
to
understand
a
little
i
glad
glad
that
you
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
men
it
would
have
killed
me
if
you
had
had
any
part
in
this
now
presently
the
banker
asked
have
you
seen
abe
lee
no
why
do
you
think
have
they
discharged
him
too
he
would
stay
anyway
after
their
treatment
of
the
seer
i
would
want
him
to
they
wo
let
him
out
if
they
can
keep
him
holmes
will
need
him
said
worth
they
he
added

better
tell
abe
to
stay
barbara
gasped
what
do
you
mean
tell
him
to
stay

the
race
now
began
pouring
its
life
into
the
barren
wastes
of
the
king
basin
desert
in
the
city
by
the
sea
at
the
end
of
the
southwestern
and
continental
there
was
a
suite
of
offices
with
real
gold
letters
on
the
doors
richly
spelling
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
behind
these
doors
there
was
real
mahogany
furniture
solid
substantial
and
rich
a
high
safe
many
attractive
maps
and
a
gentleman
who
never
having
traveled
west
of
buffalo
before
could
answer
with
authority
every
conceivable
question
relating
to
the
reclamation
of
the
arid
lands
of
the
great
west
when
there
were
no
more
questions
to
ask
he
could
still
tell
you
many
things
of
the
wonderland
of
wealth
that
was
being
opened
to
the
public
by
the

went
forth
to
the
advertising
departments
of
the
magazines
and
papers
skillfully
prepared
copy
which
in
turn
was
followed
by
pamphlets
circulars
and
letters
innumerable
in
one
room
a
company
of
clerks
and
and
accountants
pored
over
their
tasks
at
desks
and
counters
in
another
a
squad
of
stenographers
filled
the
air
with
the
sound
of
their
through
the
doors
of
the
different
rooms
passed
an
endless
procession
men
from
the
front
with
the
marks
of
the
desert
sun
on
their
faces
engineers
superintendents
bosses
messengers
agents
servants
of
the
company
laborers
of
every
sort
and
nationality
came
in
answer
to
the
cry
men
wanted
special
salesmen
from
foundry
factory
and
shop
drawn
by
prospective
large
sales
of
machinery
implements
and
supplies
men
from
everywhere
seeking
information
and
opportunity
for
investment
at
deep
well
which
is
no
well
at
all
on
the
rim
of
the
basin
trainloads
of
supplies
implements
machinery
lumber
and
construction
material
horses
mules
and
men
were
daily
and
unloaded
on
the
desert
sands
overland
travelers
gazed
in
startled
wonder
at
the
scene
of
stirring
activity
that
burst
so
suddenly
upon
them
in
the
midst
of
the
barren
land
through
which
they
had
ridden
for
hours
without
sight
of
a
human
habitation
or
sign
of
man
the
great
mountain
of
goods
piled
on
the
dun
plain
the
bands
of
horses
and
mules
the
the
blankets
spread
on
the
bare
ground
the
men
moving
here
and
there
in
seemingly
hopeless
confusion
all
looked
so
ridiculously
out
of
place
and
so
pitifully
helpless
every
hour
companies
of
men
with
teams
and
vehicles
set
out
from
the
camp
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
silent
distance
night
and
day
the
huge
mountain
of
goods
was
attacked
by
the
freighters
who
with
their
big
wagons
drawn
by
six
eight
twelve
or
more
mules
appeared
mysteriously
out
of
the
weird
landscape
as
if
they
were
spirits
materialized
by
some
mighty
unknown
genii
of
the
desert
their
heavy
wagons
loaded
their
water
barrels
filled
they
turned
again
to
the
unseen
realm
from
which
they
had
been
summoned
the
sound
of
the
loud
voices
of
the
drivers
the
creaking
of
the
wagons
the
jingle
of
harness
the
reports
of
long
whips
died
quickly
away
while
to
the
vision
the
outfits
passed
slowly
fading
dissolving
in
their
great
clouds
of
dust
into
the
land
of
mystery
in
rubio
city
jefferson
worth
continued
on
his
way
at
the
pioneer
bank
apparently
paying
no
heed
to
the
movement
that
offered
such
opportunities
for
profitable
investment
barbara
rarely
spoke
now
of
the
work
that
had
been
so
dear
to
her
nor
did
she
ever
ride
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
mesa
to
look
over
the
desert
the
seer
was
in
the
northern
railroad
work
again
but
abe
lee
with
tex
and
pat
and
pablo
garcia
had
gone
with
the
beginning
of
the
stream
of
life
that
was
pouring
into
the
new
country
true
to
the
plans
of
the
company
at
the
largest
and
most
central
of
the
supply
camps
located
in
the
very
heart
of
the
basin
the
townsite
of
kingston
was
laid
out
and
even
in
the
days
when
every
drop
of
water
was
hauled
from
three
to
ten
miles
town
lots
were
offered
for
sale
and
sold
to
eager
speculators
a
year
from
the
beginning
of
the
work
at
the
intake
at
the
river
water
was
turned
into
the
canals
with
the
coming
of
the
water
kingston
changed
almost
between
suns
from
a
rude
supply
camp
to
an
established
town
with
stores
hotel
blacksmith
shop
livery
stables
all
in
buildings
more
or
less
substantial
most
substantial
of
all
was
the
building
owned
and
occupied
by
the
offices
of
the
company
with
the
coming
of
the
water
also
the
stream
of
human
life
that
flowed
into
the
basin
was
swollen
by
hundreds
of
settlers
driven
by
the
master
passion
good
business
to
toil
and
traffic
to
build
the
city
to
subdue
and
cultivate
the
land
and
thus
to
realize
the
seer
dream
while
the
engineer
himself
was
banished
from
the
work
to
which
he
had
given
his
life
every
sunrise
saw
new
springing
up
on
the
claims
of
the
settlers
around
the
company
town
and
new
buildings
beginning
in
the
center
of
it
all
kingston
every
sunset
saw
miles
of
new
ditches
ready
to
receive
the
water
from
the
canal
and
acres
of
new
land
cleared
and
graded
for
irrigation
thus
it
was
that
afternoon
when
from
his
office
window
burk
the
general
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
watched
a
freighter
with
a
load
of
goods
stop
his
team
directly
across
the
street
in
front
of
the
largest
and
most
important
general
store
in
the
basin
deck
jordan
the
merchant
came
out
and
the
manager
easily
heard
the
driver
loud
voice
jim
be
along
in
another
hour
i
reckon
we
aim
to
get
the
rest
in
two
more
trips
six
loads
in
that
shipment
thought
the
manager
and
that
fellow
set
up
business
with
a
load
of
stuff
an
empty
wagon
was
driven
up
to
the
store
and
the
general
manager
recognized
in
the
driver
one
of
the
company
men
from
a
grading
camp
six
miles
away
while
another
wagon
a
company
wagon
also
nearly
filled
with
supplies
moved
away
toward
the
open
desert
deck
business
was
assuming
quite
respectable
proportions
thought
burk
and
deck
business
was
mostly
with
employes
of
the
company
taking
a
cigar
from
a
box
on
his
desk
burk
scratched
a
match
on
the
heel
of
his
shoe
and
leaning
back
in
his
office
chair
continued
thinking
the
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
was
paid
to
think
the
company
hired
burk
peculiar
talent
even
as
they
hired
the
physical
strength
of
their
laborers
or
the
professional
skill
of
their
engineers
as
he
meditated
the
manager
still
watched
from
the
window
the
activities
of
the
street
soon
from
the
open
desert
beyond
the
last
new
building
down
the
street
he
saw
a
horseman
approaching
at
an
easy
swinging
lope
the
rider
came
straight
toward
the
company
headquarters
and
as
he
drew
near
the
manager
recognized
the
chief
engineer
greeting
the
man
at
the
open
window
as
he
passed
willard
holmes
dismounted
at
the
entrance
of
the
building
and
going
first
to
the
water
tank
soon
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
manager
room
the
engineer
clothes
from
boots
to
stetson
were
covered
with
dust
and
his
face
was
deeply
bronzed
by
the
months
in
the
open
air
turning
from
the
window
burk
held
out
the
box
of
cigars
no
thanks
said
the
chief
with
a
smile
i
hot
as
a
lime
kiln
now
wait
until
after
supper
throwing
his
hat
and
gloves
on
the
floor
he
dropped
into
a
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
grateful
coolness
of
the
room
after
hours
of
riding
in
the
dazzling
light
of
the
desert
sun
the
other
returning
the
box
to
its
place
tipped
back
in
his
chair
and
elevated
his
feet
to
his
desk
and
with
his
cigar
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
head
cocked
suggestively
to
one
side
looked
his
companion
over
with
a
critical
smile
i
say
holmes
how
would
you
like
to
be
in
little
old
new
york
this
evening
at
the
question
and
the
manner
of
the
speaker
the
engineer
held
up
his
hands
with
a
motion
of
protest
as
he
commanded
in
tragic
voice
get
thee
behind
me
satan
then
at
the
manager
laugh
he
added
seriously
new
york
is
all
right
burk
but
i
guess
i
can
manage
to
stick
it
out
here
a
while
longer
burk
looked
at
the
engineer
with
the
same
thoughtful
expression
that
had
marked
his
face
when
he
watched
the
of
supplies
before
the
store
across
the
street
i
have
noticed
that
you
show
symptoms
of
slowly
developing
an
interest
in
your
job
he
murmured
you
were
at
the
river
yesterday
no
i
was
at
number
five
heading
abe
lee
will
be
in
from
the
intake
this
afternoon
i
was
there
day
before
yesterday
how
is
the
little
old
colorado
behaving
herself
all
right
so
far
our
work
is
all
a
guess
though
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
data
to
go
on
you
know
there
was
a
hint
of
anxiety
in
the
chief
engineer
answer
i
suppose
you
find
the
talkative
abe
cheerfully
optimistic
about
the
future
of
our
structures
as
usual
holmes
did
not
smile
at
the
jesting
tone
of
the
manager
lee
is
certainly
doing
all
he
can
to
make
things
safe
he
is
a
fiend
for
thoroughness
and
between
you
and
me
burk
the
company
to
spend
more
money
on
that
intake
at
least
a
few
more
thousands
would
make
it
what
it
should
be
the
man
who
was
paid
to
think
held
out
a
hand
protestingly
my
dear
boy
how
many
times
have
we
gone
over
that
the
company
will
spend
just
what
they
must
spend
to
get
this
scheme
going
and
not
a
cent
more
later
when
the
business
justifies
they
will
improve
the
system
get
yourself
sidetracked
by
the
notion
that
this
whole
project
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
dear
people
and
that
the
company
is
made
up
of
benevolent
old
gentlemen
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
wealth
but
promote
philanthropic
enterprises
you
should
know
your
uncle
jim
better
dividends
my
boy
dividends
that
what
we
all
here
for
and
you
ca
afford
to
forget
it
by
the
way
did
you
have
any
dinner
i
struck
camp
seven
on
the
alamitos
at
noon
sour
bread
frijoles
or
was
it
canned
corn
i
say
old
man
do
you
remember
some
of
the
places
where
we
used
to
dine
at
home
flowers
and
music
and
table
linen
and
real
dishes
and
waiters
with
real
food
and
women
god
bless
real
women
what
would
you
give
holmes
for
something
to
eat
that
had
never
been
preserved
embalmed
cured
dried
or
tinned
it
not
a
dream
of
fairyland
my
boy
there
are
such
places
in
the
world
and
there
are
such
things
to
eat
come
what
do
you
say
where
shall
we
dine
tonight
and
what
will
you
have
you
fiend
growled
holmes
you
know
i
sell
my
soul
this
minute
for
one
good
red
apple
lowering
his
feet
to
the
floor
and
rising
the
manager
of
the
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
crossed
the
room
stealthily
and
carefully
closed
the
door
then
taking
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
with
an
air
of
great
secrecy
he
unlocked
a
drawer
in
his
desk
pulled
it
open
and
took
out
the
company
chief
engineer
fell
on
the
manager
with
an
exclamation
of
amazement
and
delight
really
said
burk
as
he
watched
the
fruit
disappear
your
pleasure
almost
justifies
my
crime
i
even
feel
repaid
for
my
there
were
only
three
in
the
basket
how
did
you
do
it
asked
holmes
between
bites
gazing
at
the
apple
in
his
hand
as
though
to
devour
the
treat
with
his
eyes
also
thereby
doubling
the
pleasure
it
was
one
of
our
dearly
beloved
prospective
settlers
the
thoughtful
manager
explained
with
an
air
of
conscious
merit
he
came
in
from
somewhere
yesterday
to
spy
out
the
land
and
being
a
prudent
and
thrifty
farmer
he
possesses
or
is
possessed
by
a
prudent
and
thrifty
wife
said
wife
fitted
out
said
farmer
for
his
journey
into
this
far
country
with
a
market
basket
of
provisions
provisions
willard
my
son
made
a
whole
basket
full
he
had
one
feed
left
and
was
finishing
it
out
there
on
the
sidewalk
when
i
returned
from
what
we
of
this
benighted
land
call
dinner
how
could
i
help
looking
i
watched
him
devour
the
leg
of
a
chicken
i
watched
him
eat
real
bread
with
jelly
on
it
then
i
caught
sight
of
three
apples
holmes
such
wealth
is
criminal
i
considered
i
became
an
anarchist
he
was
a
big
husky
and
i
dared
not
assault
him
so
i
talked
lord
forgive
me
how
i
talked
i
offered
confidential
advice
i
conjured
up
visions
of
wealth
untold
i
laid
him
under
a
spell
and
gently
led
him
and
his
basket
into
the
office
even
as
he
finished
the
pie
i
showed
him
maps
i
gave
him
a
cigar
i
urged
him
to
leave
his
basket
and
satchel
here
in
my
private
office
for
while
he
looked
around
gladly
he
accepted
my
invitation
his
confidence
was
pathetic
how
could
the
poor
trusting
farmer
know
that
i
was
ready
if
necessary
to
murder
him
for
his
fortune
when
he
had
gone
i
locked
the
door
and
i
i
i
only
took
two
holmes
i
dared
not
take
them
all
for
he
was
big
and
rough
as
i
say
but
i
could
not
believe
that
a
man
with
such
wealth
could
miss
a
part
of
it
but
you
said
you
ate
two
said
the
engineer
severely
taking
another
long
lingering
bite
i
did
returned
the
manager
with
awful
solemnity
when
that
trusting
but
husky
farmer
returned
later
for
his
possessions
he
thanked
me
many
times
for
my
kindness
while
i
trembled
with
the
consciousness
of
my
guilt
assuring
him
that
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
no
trouble
at
all
and
then
just
as
i
felt
sure
that
he
was
going
and
was
beginning
to
breathe
easier
he
stopped
and
fumbled
around
in
his
basket
my
heart
stood
still
put
some
fine
apples
in
my
dinner
he
muttered
thought
maybe
you
might
like
some
reckon
i
must
after
all
i
thought
there
was
no
by
jocks
here
she
is
holmes
as
i
live
he
handed
me
that
other
apple
it
was
positively
uncanny
i
was
speechless
not
until
he
was
gone
did
i
realize
that
it
was
prophetic
in
like
manner
shall
the
settlers
the
farmers
save
this
land
and
us
from
destruction
it
good
business
returned
holmes
it
exactly
illustrates
your
methods
of
dealing
with
the
confiding
public
humph
grunted
the
other
i
observe
that
you
do
not
hesitate
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
my
financiering
a
knock
at
the
door
prevented
the
engineer
reply
come
in
called
burk
the
door
opened
and
abe
lee
stood
on
the
threshold
the
two
men
greeted
the
surveyor
cordially
but
with
that
subtle
touch
in
their
voices
that
hinted
at
consciousness
of
superior
position
and
authority
abe
addressed
himself
directly
to
his
chief
saying
we
finished
at
the
intake
last
night
sir
and
moved
to
dry
river
heading
this
morning
as
you
directed
you
left
everything
at
the
river
in
good
shape
of
course
the
surveyor
did
not
answer
the
tobacco
and
paper
that
in
his
long
fingers
were
assuming
the
form
of
a
cigarette
seemed
to
demand
his
undivided
attention
burk
was
thoughtfully
watching
the
two
men
at
the
critical
moment
he
handed
abe
a
match
from
the
cloud
of
smoke
abe
spoke
again
the
outfit
will
be
ready
to
begin
work
at
the
heading
morning
before
holmes
could
speak
the
manager
said
you
evidently
still
think
lee
that
the
work
at
the
river
is
not
satisfactory
are
you
still
predicting
that
our
intake
will
go
out
with
the
next
high
water
i
do
know
whether
the
next
high
water
will
do
it
or
not
the
rio
colorado
alone
wo
hurt
us
but
when
the
gila
and
the
little
colorado
go
on
the
and
come
down
on
top
of
a
high
colorado
flood
catch
hell
it
may
be
this
season
it
may
be
next
it
depends
on
the
snowfall
in
the
upper
countries
and
the
weather
in
the
spring
but
it
come
and
it
will
come
again
how
do
you
know
there
have
been
no
records
kept
and
no
surveys
we
have
no
data
there
data
enough
the
colorado
leaves
her
own
record
i
know
the
country
i
know
what
the
river
has
done
and
i
know
what
the
indians
have
told
me
at
the
surveyor
words
his
chief
stirred
impatiently
and
the
manager
answered
but
we
ca
spend
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
on
a
mere
guess
at
what
happen
lee
when
the
country
is
fairly
well
settled
and
business
justifies
we
will
put
in
a
new
intake
in
the
meantime
those
structures
will
have
to
do
the
and
is
not
in
business
for
glory
you
know
abe
spoke
softly
from
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
are
you
explaining
this
situation
to
the
people
who
are
coming
here
by
the
hundreds
to
settle
do
they
understand
the
chances
they
are
taking
when
they
buy
water
rights
and
go
ahead
to
develop
their
ranches
certainly
not
if
we
talked
risks
no
one
would
come
in
the
company
must
protect
its
interests
who
protects
the
settlers
interests
the
manager
stiffened
i
do
recognize
your
right
to
criticise
the
company
policy
lee
holmes
is
our
chief
engineer
and
he
assures
me
that
our
structures
are
as
good
as
they
can
be
made
with
the
money
at
our
disposal
we
can
only
carry
out
the
policies
of
the
company
and
we
are
responsible
to
them
for
the
money
we
spend
you
have
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
whatever
oh
hell
burk
drawled
abe
though
his
eyes
contradicted
flatly
his
soft
tone
there
no
occasion
for
you
to
climb
so
high
up
that
ladder
you
been
a
corporation
mouthpiece
so
long
you
have
no
more
soul
than
the
company
he
turned
to
his
chief
i
left
andy
in
charge
at
camp
he
understands
that
i
will
not
be
back
i
dropped
my
resignation
in
your
box
in
the
office
as
i
came
in
adios
leaving
the
office
abe
walked
slowly
down
the
street
through
the
heart
of
the
company
little
town
on
every
hand
he
saw
the
work
that
was
being
wrought
in
the
desert
there
were
business
blocks
and
houses
in
every
stage
of
building
from
the
foundation
to
the
of
the
tenants
the
air
rang
with
sound
of
hammer
and
saw
teams
and
wagons
from
the
ranches
lined
the
street
the
very
faces
of
the
people
he
met
glowed
with
enthusiasm
while
determination
and
purpose
were
expressed
in
their
very
movements
as
they
hurried
by
a
mile
west
of
town
the
surveyor
stopped
on
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
main
canal
he
paused
to
look
around
he
saw
the
country
already
dotted
with
the
white
of
the
settlers
and
even
as
he
looked
three
new
wagons
loaded
with
supplies
and
implements
passed
bound
for
the
claims
of
the
owners
under
his
feet
the
water
from
the
distant
river
ran
strongly
to
the
west
was
a
grading
camp
on
the
line
of
a
company
ditch
to
the
south
was
another
far
to
the
north
and
east
along
the
rim
of
the
basin
he
knew
the
railroad
was
bringing
other
pioneers
by
the
hundreds
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
taking
off
his
sombrero
drank
in
the
scene
how
he
loved
it
all
it
was
the
seer
dream
but
the
seer
could
have
no
part
in
it
it
was
barbara
desert
but
barbara
was
shut
out
exiled
it
was
his
work
but
he
was
powerless
to
do
it
the
seer
had
told
him
to
stay
for
his
work
sake
he
smiled
grimly
remembering
the
manager
words
barbara
had
told
him
to
stay
but
the
girl
knew
nothing
of
conditions
how
could
she
know
jefferson
worth
had
told
him
to
stay
why
barbara
in
her
letters
never
spoke
of
the
work
the
seer
seldom
wrote
jefferson
worth
never
every
month
the
situation
had
grown
more
unbearable
burk
might
insist
that
he
had
no
responsibility
and
holmes
might
argue
that
they
could
only
do
their
best
with
what
funds
the
company
would
supply
abe
was
not
of
their
school
well
he
was
out
of
it
now
for
good
he
was
not
the
kind
of
a
man
the
company
wanted
returning
to
town
he
had
supper
at
the
little
shack
restaurant
and
going
to
the
tent
house
owned
by
himself
and
two
that
they
might
have
a
place
to
sleep
when
in
town
he
gathered
his
few
possessions
together
in
readiness
for
departure
in
the
morning
when
the
brief
task
was
finished
and
he
had
written
a
note
to
his
two
friends
who
were
away
he
went
out
again
on
the
main
street
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
it
was
evening
now
and
the
usual
crowd
was
gathered
in
front
of
the
to
watch
the
arrival
of
the
stage
the
one
event
of
interest
to
these
hardy
pioneers
in
the
throng
there
were
teamsters
laborers
ranchers
mechanics
agents
speculators
surveyors
gathered
from
camp
and
field
and
town
some
were
expecting
letters
from
the
home
folks
in
the
world
outside
a
few
were
looking
for
friends
among
the
passengers
many
were
there
as
was
abe
because
it
was
the
point
of
interest
all
were
roughly
clad
marked
by
the
desert
wind
and
sun
it
was
among
such
men
as
these
that
abe
lee
life
had
been
spent
such
scenes
as
these
were
home
scenes
to
him
in
a
peculiar
way
through
the
seer
and
barbara
the
work
that
these
men
were
doing
was
dear
to
him
he
felt
that
he
was
being
cast
out
of
his
own
place
as
he
passed
through
the
throng
abe
heard
always
the
same
topic
of
conversation
the
work
the
work
the
work
news
to
these
men
meant
more
miles
of
canal
finished
new
ditches
dug
more
land
leveled
and
graded
new
settlers
located
the
surveyor
thought
of
the
future
of
these
people
given
wholly
into
the
hands
of
the
company
of
the
men
in
the
east
who
knew
nothing
of
their
hardships
but
who
would
force
them
to
pay
royal
tribute
out
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
of
how
even
then
they
were
increasing
the
value
of
the
company
property
here
she
comes
cried
someone
and
all
eyes
were
turned
to
see
the
stage
swinging
down
the
street
abe
drew
back
a
little
to
the
thin
edge
of
the
crowd
he
was
expecting
neither
letters
nor
friends
the
six
broncos
were
brought
to
a
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
the
mail
bag
was
tossed
to
the
and
the
passengers
began
climbing
down
from
their
seats
as
the
last
man
rose
from
his
place
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
stooped
position
gripping
with
each
hand
one
of
the
standards
that
supported
the
canvas
top
of
the
vehicle
looking
out
thus
over
the
crowd
he
seemed
to
be
gathering
data
for
an
estimate
of
the
population
before
he
felt
cautiously
with
his
foot
for
the
step
abe
lee
started
forward
with
an
exclamation
it
was
jefferson
worth
chapter
xii
signs
of
conflict
not
a
line
of
jefferson
worth
countenance
changed
as
the
tall
surveyor
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
about
the
new
arrivals
greeted
him
but
abe
lee
felt
the
man
from
behind
his
gray
mask
reaching
out
to
grasp
his
innermost
thoughts
and
emotions
where
is
the
hotel
abe
explained
that
the
rough
board
shelter
that
bore
that
name
was
full
to
the
door
people
were
even
sleeping
on
the
floor
but
there
is
room
in
our
tent
worth
he
finished
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
crowd
to
the
surveyor
eager
questions
the
banker
answered
that
barbara
was
visiting
friends
in
the
coast
city
when
they
had
reached
the
tent
and
abe
had
found
and
lighted
a
lantern
worth
said
and
his
manner
was
as
though
he
were
continuing
a
conversation
that
had
been
interrupted
only
for
a
moment
well
i
see
you
stayed
at
his
words
the
surveyor
who
was
filling
a
tin
with
fresh
water
that
his
guest
might
wash
away
the
dust
of
his
journey
felt
the
hot
blood
in
his
cheeks
before
answering
he
pulled
an
old
from
under
a
cot
in
one
corner
of
the
canvas
room
and
rummaging
therein
brought
to
light
a
clean
towel
when
he
had
placed
this
evidence
of
civilization
beside
the
basin
on
the
box
that
did
duty
as
a
he
answered
i
quit
the
company
this
afternoon
why
because
i
wo
do
the
kind
of
work
the
company
wants
the
surveyor
spoke
hotly
now
the
man
busy
with
the
basin
of
water
made
no
comment
and
abe
continued
worth
they
are
putting
in
the
cheapest
possible
kind
of
wooden
structures
all
through
the
system
even
at
points
where
the
safety
of
the
whole
project
depends
on
the
control
of
the
water
the
intake
itself
is
nothing
but
the
flimsiest
sort
of
a
makeshift
one
good
flood
such
as
we
have
every
few
years
and
there
would
be
a
damned
stick
of
it
left
in
twelve
hours
you
remember
what
the
grade
is
from
the
river
at
the
point
of
the
intake
this
way
into
the
basin
and
you
know
how
water
cuts
this
soil
if
that
gate
goes
out
the
whole
river
will
come
through
and
these
settlers
who
are
tumbling
over
each
other
to
put
into
this
country
every
cent
they
have
in
the
world
will
lose
everything
the
company
takes
its
chances
with
the
settlers
does
it
the
company
takes
mighty
small
chances
compared
to
the
risk
the
settlers
are
carrying
as
a
matter
of
fact
worth
it
is
the
people
who
are
building
this
system
not
the
company
at
all
to
prove
up
on
these
desert
claims
the
government
compels
them
to
have
the
water
they
ca
use
the
water
without
paying
the
company
for
the
right
after
they
have
bought
the
water
rights
then
they
must
pay
for
every
they
use
all
greenfield
and
his
bunch
did
was
to
put
up
enough
to
start
the
thing
going
and
the
people
are
doing
the
rest
the
company
knows
the
risk
and
stakes
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
capital
the
settlers
know
nothing
of
the
real
conditions
and
stake
everything
they
have
in
the
world
if
the
company
would
tell
the
people
the
situation
it
would
be
square
but
you
know
what
would
happen
if
they
did
that
no
one
would
come
in
as
it
is
the
company
by
risking
the
smallest
amount
possible
leads
the
people
to
risk
everything
they
have
and
yet
the
greenfield
crowd
stands
to
win
big
on
the
whole
stake
worth
was
drying
his
slim
fingers
with
careful
precision
i
figured
that
was
the
way
it
would
be
done
that
the
way
all
these
big
enterprises
are
launched
the
first
work
is
always
done
on
a
estimate
later
when
the
business
justifies
the
system
will
be
strengthened
and
improved
which
means
retorted
the
surveyor
that
when
the
company
has
taken
enough
money
from
the
settlers
whom
they
have
induced
to
stake
everything
they
have
on
the
gamble
by
letting
them
think
it
is
a
sure
thing
they
will
use
part
of
to
give
the
people
what
they
they
are
getting
now
the
banker
laid
the
towel
carefully
aside
and
disposed
of
the
water
in
the
by
the
primitive
method
of
throwing
it
from
the
tent
door
then
he
spoke
again
the
people
themselves
could
never
start
a
work
like
this
and
if
there
was
a
chance
to
make
a
big
thing
capital
would
it
the
size
of
the
profit
compared
with
the
amount
invested
that
draws
capital
into
this
kind
of
a
thing
if
the
company
had
to
take
all
the
chance
in
this
project
they
would
simply
stay
out
and
the
work
would
never
be
done
this
feature
of
unequal
risk
is
the
very
thing
and
the
only
thing
that
could
attract
the
money
to
start
this
proposition
going
and
that
what
people
like
you
and
the
seer
and
barbara
ca
see
holmes
and
burk
ca
help
themselves
greenfield
and
the
company
and
they
are
just
as
honest
as
other
men
they
are
simply
promoting
this
scheme
in
the
only
way
possible
to
start
it
and
the
people
will
share
the
results
holmes
and
burk
are
all
right
except
that
they
owned
body
and
soul
by
the
company
said
abe
quickly
but
greenfield
and
the
men
who
engineered
this
thing
look
to
me
like
a
bunch
of
men
who
live
on
the
confidence
of
the
people
the
people
will
gain
their
farms
just
the
same
returned
the
financier
they
would
have
anything
without
the
company
the
surveyor
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
you
may
be
right
worth
but
i
had
all
i
can
stand
of
it
again
jefferson
worth
looked
full
into
the
younger
man
eyes
and
abe
felt
that
something
behind
the
mask
reaching
out
to
seize
the
thoughts
and
motives
that
lay
back
of
his
words
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
punch
steers
or
get
a
job
in
a
mine
somewhere
i
reckon
i
going
somewhere
out
of
this
i
had
enough
of
estimates
suppose
you
stay
and
work
for
me
abe
lee
sprang
to
his
feet
work
for
you
here
i
thought
you
had
refused
to
go
into
this
deal
i
declined
to
join
greenfield
company
said
the
banker
exactly
do
you
mean
worth
that
you
are
going
to
operate
in
the
basin
independently
knowing
the
company
strength
and
the
whole
situation
as
you
do
i
have
decided
to
take
a
chance
with
the
rest
was
the
unemotional
answer
i
sold
out
of
the
bank
and
cleaned
up
everything
in
rubio
city
last
week
but
what
are
you
going
into
here
i
can
use
you
if
you
want
to
stay
came
the
cautious
answer
stay
of
course
i
stay
it
was
characteristic
of
these
men
that
nothing
was
said
of
salary
on
either
side
extinguishing
the
lantern
abe
led
the
way
out
into
the
night
the
darkness
was
intense
and
unrelieved
save
by
the
thin
broken
line
of
twinkling
lights
from
the
windows
of
the
buildings
which
gave
them
the
direction
of
the
main
street
and
the
few
dull
glowing
tent
houses
whose
tenants
were
at
home
overhead
the
desert
stars
shone
with
a
brilliance
that
put
to
shame
the
feeble
efforts
of
the
while
about
the
little
pioneer
town
the
desert
night
drew
close
with
its
circling
wall
of
mystery
did
jefferson
worth
think
as
he
stumbled
along
by
the
surveyor
side
of
that
other
night
in
the
hollow
of
god
hand
when
he
had
faced
alone
the
spirit
of
the
land
this
town
needs
an
electric
lighting
system
he
said
in
his
colorless
voice
when
jefferson
worth
had
finished
supper
in
the
shack
restaurant
he
proposed
cautiously
that
they
look
around
a
little
the
street
was
lined
with
teams
and
saddle
horses
their
forms
shadowy
and
indistinct
in
the
dark
places
of
vacant
lots
or
where
buildings
were
under
construction
but
standing
forth
with
startling
clearness
where
the
light
from
a
store
streamed
forth
the
sidewalk
was
filled
with
men
from
the
ranches
and
grading
camps
who
had
come
to
town
after
sunset
for
their
mail
or
supplies
so
that
no
hour
of
the
day
should
be
lost
to
the
work
that
had
called
them
into
the
desert
and
these
figures
passed
to
and
fro
through
the
bands
of
light
and
darkness
gathered
in
groups
in
front
of
the
stores
and
dissolved
again
to
form
other
groups
or
to
lose
themselves
in
the
general
throng
every
moment
a
of
men
a
party
of
horsemen
or
a
single
rider
would
appear
suddenly
and
mysteriously
out
of
the
night
while
others
leaving
the
throng
to
depart
in
like
manner
would
be
swallowed
up
as
mysteriously
by
the
blackness
in
the
center
of
the
picture
and
the
very
heart
of
the
activity
was
the
general
store
opposite
the
office
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
deck
jordan
had
opened
his
store
in
the
days
when
kingston
was
still
a
supply
camp
no
one
knew
much
about
deck
or
how
he
had
guessed
that
the
camp
would
become
the
chief
town
in
the
new
country
he
was
a
pleasing
capable
but
man
who
knew
what
to
buy
paid
his
bills
promptly
and
with
one
exception
conducted
his
business
on
a
cash
basis
the
exception
to
the
cash
rule
was
in
favor
of
the
company
employes
it
was
on
deck
initiative
that
an
arrangement
was
made
with
burk
by
which
the
company
men
received
credit
at
the
store
the
amount
of
their
bills
being
deducted
from
their
wages
each
month
by
the
company
paymaster
it
was
this
plan
that
by
giving
deck
practically
all
of
the
trade
from
the
hundreds
of
company
employes
had
increased
his
business
so
rapidly
to
the
thoughtful
manager
also
the
plan
seemed
good
he
foresaw
how
with
the
company
thus
controlling
the
bulk
of
the
merchant
business
he
could
when
the
proper
time
came
persuade
deck
to
enter
into
a
still
closer
arrangement
thus
carrying
out
the
good
business
policy
of
the
company
that
very
afternoon
burk
had
decided
the
time
had
come
and
had
so
written
greenfield
leisurely
jefferson
worth
and
his
companion
worked
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
into
the
store
where
deck
and
his
helpers
were
toiling
to
supply
the
various
needs
of
a
small
army
of
customers
from
the
open
doors
and
from
the
big
implement
shed
in
the
rear
of
the
building
a
steady
stream
of
provisions
clothing
dry
goods
hardware
blankets
harness
and
tools
flowed
forth
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
deck
himself
was
holding
an
animated
conversation
with
a
purchaser
i
be
mighty
glad
to
accommodate
you
sam
if
i
could
but
you
know
we
running
this
store
on
a
cash
basis
and
i
ca
break
my
rules
if
i
begin
with
you
have
to
do
it
for
everybody
and
i
ca
you
do
make
these
company
men
pay
cash
anybody
injuns
greasers
or
anything
else
gets
what
he
wants
and
no
questions
asked
if
he
works
for
the
company
but
that
different
you
see
explained
deck
we
have
an
arrangement
with
the
company
by
which
they
hold
out
from
each
man
pay
the
amount
of
my
bills
against
him
i
understand
that
but
you
find
out
that
it
the
rancher
trade
that
keep
you
going
we
be
here
long
after
these
ditchers
mule
skinners
have
left
the
country
and
we
have
money
to
spend
you
find
too
that
when
things
begin
to
come
our
way
stand
by
the
store
that
stand
by
us
now
when
we
got
everything
goin
out
an
nothin
comin
in
deck
over
the
shoulder
of
the
rancher
saw
jefferson
worth
and
the
surveyor
who
with
several
others
had
drawn
near
attracted
by
the
loud
tones
of
the
farmer
abe
thought
that
he
caught
a
look
of
recognition
as
deck
eyes
fell
on
his
companion
but
the
banker
gave
no
sign
the
merchant
answering
his
customer
said
i
know
you
are
right
about
that
part
of
it
sam
and
i
like
to
back
every
rancher
in
this
basin
if
i
could
but
i
ca
why
not
ai
you
runnin
this
store
before
deck
could
reply
to
abe
astonishment
the
quiet
voice
of
jefferson
worth
broke
in
you
are
improving
a
ranch
of
your
own
near
here
the
settler
turned
sharply
you
bet
i
am
mister
leastwise
tryin
to
and
if
workin
from
dark
an
livin
on
til
i
can
make
a
crop
will
pull
me
through
i
make
it
i
suppose
the
heaviest
expense
is
all
in
getting
started
asked
worth
as
if
seeking
to
verify
an
observation
it
sure
is
replied
the
pioneer
there
the
outfit
you
got
to
have
an
tools
you
got
to
build
your
ditches
and
grade
your
land
and
you
got
to
buy
water
rights
and
pay
for
your
water
and
you
got
to
make
your
payments
to
the
government
then
feed
for
your
and
yourself
an
there
ai
nothin
to
bring
in
a
cent
you
can
make
a
crop
the
farmers
that
are
comin
into
this
country
ai
got
a
great
big
pile
of
ready
money
stacked
away
mister
an
they
mighty
apt
to
run
a
little
short
the
first
year
when
our
home
merchants
who
expect
to
make
their
money
off
from
us
wo
even
trust
us
for
a
few
dollars
worth
of
provisions
we
can
get
a
start
i
damned
if
it
ai
tough
but
everyone
is
a
stranger
in
this
new
country
said
worth
how
can
a
merchant
know
whether
a
man
will
pay
or
not
i
suppose
there
are
ranchers
coming
in
here
who
would
beat
a
bill
if
they
could
the
merchants
have
to
pay
for
their
goods
or
close
up
i
reckon
that
all
so
returned
the
other
and
of
course
everybody
knows
that
there
never
was
such
a
thing
as
dishonest
merchants
do
never
beat
anybody
with
short
weight
and
all
that
this
raised
a
laugh
in
which
deck
joined
as
heartily
as
anyone
even
the
banker
smiled
coldly
as
he
asked
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
did
say
but
it
sam
warren
where
is
your
ranch
six
miles
north
on
the
number
one
main
well
warren
i
been
considering
this
proposition
and
i
got
it
figured
out
like
this
we
all
want
to
make
what
we
can
in
this
new
country
that
what
we
came
in
for
this
store
ca
get
along
without
the
ranchers
support
and
you
ranchers
ca
get
along
without
the
store
we
all
got
to
pull
together
and
help
each
other
i
believe
that
many
of
the
men
who
come
into
this
desert
to
actually
settle
on
and
improve
the
land
are
the
kind
of
men
who
beat
their
bills
i
figured
to
run
on
a
cash
basis
only
until
things
got
started
and
sort
of
settled
down
you
see
i
know
that
you
people
need
credit
until
you
get
on
your
feet
from
now
on
you
come
here
for
whatever
you
actually
need
you
understand
and
we
carry
you
for
any
reasonable
amount
until
you
get
something
coming
in
all
we
ask
in
return
is
that
you
ranchers
do
as
you
say
and
stand
by
us
when
you
do
get
on
top
at
jefferson
worth
simple
and
quietly
spoken
words
a
hush
fell
over
the
group
of
men
abe
lee
looked
at
his
companion
in
amazement
sam
warren
turned
from
the
stranger
to
the
and
back
to
the
stranger
the
man
behind
the
counter
was
smiling
broadly
as
if
enjoying
the
situation
when
no
one
could
find
a
word
with
which
to
break
the
silence
deck
jordan
said
gentlemen
this
is
jefferson
worth
the
owner
of
this
store
george
he
called
to
a
passing
clerk
give
sam
whatever
he
wants
as
soon
as
you
can
get
around
to
it
and
charge
it
at
this
such
a
yell
went
up
from
the
bystanders
that
a
crowd
from
the
outside
rushed
in
and
as
the
word
passed
and
others
voiced
their
approval
as
loudly
the
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
in
his
rooms
across
the
street
thought
that
another
fight
was
on
the
manager
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
conclusion
chapter
xiii
barbara
call
to
her
friends
that
night
long
after
kingston
was
still
and
the
manager
of
the
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
was
fast
asleep
jefferson
worth
and
abe
lee
talked
in
the
little
tent
that
from
the
lantern
within
glowed
in
the
darkness
seemingly
the
one
spot
of
light
under
the
desert
stars
the
next
morning
the
surveyor
left
town
on
the
stage
but
not
as
he
had
planned
abe
knew
now
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
was
bound
for
the
city
by
the
sea
and
he
carried
in
his
pocket
several
letters
of
introduction
written
by
his
employer
and
addressed
to
different
firms
engaged
in
manufacturing
and
selling
things
electrical
and
more
than
this
abe
would
see
barbara
jefferson
worth
did
not
breakfast
with
abe
that
morning
nor
did
he
see
him
off
on
the
stage
but
a
few
minutes
after
the
surveyor
had
left
town
his
employer
passed
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
store
as
worth
drew
near
his
place
of
business
he
saw
posed
just
without
the
door
one
whom
the
most
casual
of
observing
strangers
would
have
supposed
instantly
to
be
the
proprietor
of
the
store
the
owner
of
the
building
if
not
indeed
the
proprietor
and
owner
of
all
kingston
and
many
miles
of
country
round
about
the
portly
figure
clad
in
a
business
suit
of
gray
with
a
vast
expanse
of
white
vest
expressed
in
every
curve
opulent
wealth
and
lordly
generosity
the
face
fat
and
florid
beamed
upon
the
world
from
above
the
clerical
severity
of
a
black
tie
with
truly
paternal
benevolence
while
the
massive
head
was
not
in
reality
crowned
but
was
covered
by
a
hat
such
as
commanding
generals
always
wear
in
pictures
the
pose
of
the
figure
the
lift
of
the
countenance
the
kingly
mien
of
eye
and
brow
made
it
impossible
to
mistake
his
majesty
in
comparison
with
this
august
personage
the
figure
and
air
of
jefferson
worth
were
pitifully
inadequate
the
great
one
welcomed
the
financier
at
the
latter
own
door
with
an
air
of
royal
hospitality
extending
his
hand
as
if
he
stepped
down
only
one
step
from
his
throne
and
speaking
in
a
tone
that
was
meant
to
confer
marked
distinction
upon
the
humble
recipient
of
his
favor
he
said
worth
i
am
delighted
more
delighted
than
i
can
express
to
welcome
you
to
our
city
it
is
a
great
day
for
this
country
a
great
day
he
wrung
the
financier
timid
hand
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
emotional
energy
greenfield
and
i
with
our
friends
and
associates
in
the
east
and
burk
and
holmes
here
in
the
field
are
doing
what
we
can
for
these
people
but
there
is
a
great
work
here
yet
for
men
like
you
men
of
some
means
and
financial
ability
who
will
get
behind
the
smaller
business
interests
and
build
them
up
on
a
solid
foundation
my
heart
rejoiced
for
the
country
sir
when
i
heard
this
morning
that
you
had
purchased
this
establishment
deck
is
a
good
honest
fellow
you
know
but
an
expansive
smile
of
confidential
understanding
finished
this
sentence
and
the
words
my
name
is
blanton
worth
horace
blanton
seemed
to
settle
at
once
any
doubt
as
to
the
position
and
authority
of
the
speaker
jefferson
worth
did
not
explain
that
he
had
owned
the
store
from
the
beginning
and
that
deck
jordan
was
no
more
than
his
very
capable
agent
indeed
worth
said
nothing
at
all
he
even
appeared
to
shrink
with
becoming
modesty
though
there
was
the
faintest
hint
of
a
twinkle
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
a
hint
so
faint
that
horace
blanton
from
his
great
height
overlooked
it
the
big
man
in
a
lower
tone
of
confidential
familiarity
asked
have
you
heard
from
greenfield
lately
no
i
wrote
jim
some
time
ago
that
he
would
have
to
come
out
here
himself
there
are
some
conditions
developing
here
that
should
have
his
personal
attention
and
i
be
blessed
if
i
stand
seeing
him
neglect
them
i
a
western
man
myself
worth
and
you
know
we
do
things
in
this
country
you
are
interested
in
the
king
basin
company
the
answer
was
given
in
a
tone
of
tolerant
surprise
that
any
one
should
think
he
would
toy
with
a
thing
of
such
trifling
importance
me
oh
no
that
is
not
directly
you
understand
but
i
am
deeply
interested
in
the
development
of
the
country
let
me
show
you
a
little
of
what
we
are
doing
here
it
amazing
how
the
world
outside
fails
utterly
to
grasp
the
magnitude
of
the
enterprise
even
the
newspapers
are
criminally
negligent
quite
recently
i
had
occasion
to
tell
my
good
friend
the
editor
of
the
times
that
if
he
did
give
us
something
like
a
fair
showing
i
would
see
to
it
personally
that
the
bulk
of
our
business
went
to
san
felipe
it
a
burning
shame
the
way
they
have
persistently
ignored
us
worth
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
escape
but
the
white
vest
blocked
his
move
pointing
to
a
building
on
the
nearest
corner
the
great
one
explained
in
the
tone
of
a
personal
conductor
that
is
our
new
hotel
one
of
the
finest
buildings
in
the
southwest
the
young
man
who
will
run
it
for
us
is
personally
superintending
the
construction
bright
boy
too
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
him
jefferson
worth
gazing
at
the
modest
building
under
construction
murmured
you
are
interested
you
say
oh
no
that
is
only
in
a
way
you
understand
i
have
a
hand
in
most
of
these
enterprises
this
town
needs
a
good
hotel
said
worth
mildly
that
building
farther
down
the
one
where
the
foundation
is
just
completed
is
our
opera
house
it
is
being
erected
by
one
of
the
big
coast
syndicates
and
will
be
a
magnificent
hall
of
amusement
and
entertainment
as
well
as
a
place
for
public
gatherings
of
all
kinds
i
have
been
in
close
personal
touch
with
the
men
in
charge
of
the
enterprise
and
they
understand
that
we
will
tolerate
nothing
that
is
not
first
class
the
people
need
such
a
building
was
the
quiet
comment
in
the
block
opposite
our
bank
will
be
located
they
will
be
working
on
the
vault
in
another
two
weeks
while
the
building
is
well
under
way
as
you
see
the
organization
of
the
institution
is
not
yet
made
public
only
a
few
of
us
on
the
inside
you
understand
know
who
is
back
of
the
enterprise
i
see
said
jefferson
worth
a
bank
is
a
good
thing
for
the
country
pointing
up
the
street
the
great
one
in
the
white
vest
continued
there
you
see
the
office
of
our
paper
the
king
basin
messenger
the
machinery
is
being
installed
now
i
mighty
proud
of
the
young
man
who
is
starting
that
work
he
will
be
a
credit
to
us
i
promise
you
directly
opposite
is
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
building
with
the
offices
of
the
company
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
manager
burk
and
to
holmes
the
engineer
come
we
will
go
over
there
now
he
started
forward
with
perspiring
energy
but
jefferson
worth
seizing
the
opportunity
gained
the
doorway
of
the
store
and
vanished
for
two
weeks
worth
seemed
to
devote
his
time
wholly
to
his
store
though
deck
jordan
still
continued
the
active
management
it
was
generally
understood
that
worth
having
but
recently
purchased
the
establishment
retained
deck
until
as
it
was
generally
expressed
he
got
the
run
of
the
business
at
an
old
desk
in
a
of
an
office
roughly
partitioned
off
in
one
corner
of
the
room
the
financier
spent
nearly
every
hour
of
the
day
apparently
poring
over
his
accounts
here
the
manager
from
across
the
street
found
him
when
he
called
to
explain
to
worth
the
advantage
of
an
alliance
between
the
store
and
the
company
burk
did
not
stay
long
but
upon
his
return
to
his
office
wrote
a
long
confidential
letter
to
his
superiors
the
thoughtful
manager
letters
to
his
superiors
were
always
confidential
willard
holmes
also
called
to
pay
his
respects
to
inquire
whether
miss
worth
was
well
and
as
holmes
put
it
to
himself
when
he
was
again
safely
outside
the
building
to
turn
himself
inside
out
for
the
critical
inspection
of
the
man
who
hid
behind
that
gray
mask
so
far
as
the
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
observed
jefferson
worth
beside
buying
the
store
made
only
one
small
investment
he
purchased
from
the
company
a
small
tract
of
land
just
inside
the
limits
of
the
townsite
then
almost
before
burk
knew
that
it
was
before
them
the
town
council
passed
an
ordinance
granting
permission
to
the
worth
electric
company
to
place
their
poles
and
to
stretch
wires
on
the
streets
of
the
town
and
the
first
issue
of
the
king
basin
messenger
announced
with
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
that
kingston
was
to
have
lights
the
article
explained
that
abe
lee
the
well
known
engineer
formerly
with
the
and
i
company
would
have
charge
of
the
construction
work
and
would
push
it
with
his
usual
energy
for
some
time
lee
had
been
in
the
city
arranging
for
material
which
would
be
shipped
immediately
worth
had
stated
to
the
messenger
that
lee
would
return
to
kingston
in
a
day
or
two
and
would
break
ground
for
the
power
plant
at
once
the
messenger
also
gave
an
interesting
history
of
jefferson
worth
successful
career
from
to
financier
with
an
appreciation
of
his
character
and
congratulated
the
citizens
that
a
man
of
such
financial
strength
and
genius
had
come
to
invest
the
fruit
of
his
toil
in
the
new
country
burk
read
the
messenger
article
thoughtfully
then
burk
wrote
another
confidential
letter
to
his
superiors
over
this
enterprise
of
jefferson
worth
as
set
forth
in
the
messenger
the
citizens
were
enthusiastic
horace
blanton
was
more
than
enthusiastic
meeting
burk
as
the
latter
was
returning
to
his
office
after
dinner
he
blocked
the
manager
way
with
his
white
vest
and
wiping
the
sweat
of
honest
endeavor
from
his
brow
delivered
himself
well
sir
we
landed
it
biggest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
kingston
double
our
population
in
three
months
i
told
my
friend
worth
that
they
would
have
to
come
through
with
that
franchise
whether
they
wanted
to
or
not
and
by
george
we
landed
it
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
manager
thoughtfully
flicked
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
and
what
is
this
that
you
have
landed
what
have
you
heard
have
you
seen
the
messenger
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
placed
a
finger
on
the
headlines
electric
lights
for
kingston
the
manager
shifted
his
cigar
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
casting
his
head
in
the
opposite
direction
surveyed
the
excited
horace
as
an
artist
might
view
an
interesting
picture
so
you
are
interested
in
the
worth
electric
company
oh
no
that
is
not
exactly
you
know
my
name
will
not
appear
in
the
company
but
jeff
and
i
are
very
warm
friends
you
understand
and
for
the
sake
of
kingston
i
am
bound
to
take
an
interest
in
his
enterprise
at
this
the
thoughtful
burk
became
suddenly
confidential
tapping
his
companion
impressively
on
the
arm
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
of
vast
import
he
said
blanton
be
careful
be
careful
do
get
into
worth
schemes
too
deeply
a
man
of
your
standing
and
influence
you
know
ca
afford
to
play
into
the
hands
of
a
then
the
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
slipped
easily
away
before
the
other
could
reply
three
minutes
later
the
man
in
the
big
white
vest
overtook
the
company
chief
engineer
in
the
doorway
of
the
restaurant
good
morning
holmes
good
morning
the
simple
greeting
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
heart
that
was
fairly
staggering
under
a
burden
of
other
people
woes
as
the
boy
placed
their
dinners
before
them
horace
blanton
shaking
his
massive
head
murmured
sadly
it
a
burning
shame
holmes
a
burning
shame
the
coffee
you
mean
queried
the
engineer
digging
up
a
spoonful
of
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
his
heavy
cup
and
inspecting
it
critically
it
looks
shameful
all
right
and
it
may
have
been
overheated
some
time
in
past
ages
but
the
temperature
does
appear
to
be
above
normal
the
big
man
did
not
smile
his
burden
was
too
heavy
i
mean
he
explained
the
way
these
come
in
here
and
attempt
to
work
their
graft
right
under
our
eyes
did
you
hear
about
this
man
worth
getting
that
franchise
out
of
the
council
i
did
my
level
best
but
what
the
use
it
all
as
plain
as
day
but
you
ca
hammer
an
idea
into
the
boneheads
that
run
this
town
i
had
a
little
talk
with
burk
over
the
matter
this
morning
he
agrees
with
me
perfectly
got
to
take
hold
of
this
thing
holmes
or
the
town
will
go
to
the
dogs
i
wish
greenfield
would
come
on
the
engineer
agreed
heartily
that
it
might
be
well
to
take
hold
of
something
but
what
that
was
the
rub
what
he
gently
intimated
that
if
horace
blanton
could
not
find
a
way
to
avert
the
awful
calamity
that
threatened
the
public
the
public
was
in
a
bad
way
clearly
it
was
up
to
horace
to
save
kingston
the
dinner
over
the
men
separated
quickly
the
man
in
the
white
vest
to
carry
the
burden
of
kingston
future
on
his
fat
shoulders
and
the
engineer
to
inspect
the
work
at
dry
river
heading
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
abe
lee
return
to
kingston
the
surveyor
and
his
employer
were
in
worth

work
of

the
morning
and
worth
had
planned
to
leave
town
the
following
morning
for
a
week
business
trip
to
the
city
the
two
men
were
interrupted
in
their
conversation
by
a
loud
familiar

on

senorita
chapter
xiv
much
confusion
and
happy
excitement
as
the
trying
months
of
the
summer
approached
the
great
desert
so
awful
in
its
fierce
desolation
so
pregnant
with
the
life
it
was
still
so
reluctant
to
yield
gathered
all
its
dreadful
forces
to
withstand
the
inflowing
streams
of
human
energy
in
the
fierce
winds
that
rushed
through
the
mountain
passes
and
swept
across
the
hot
plains
like
a
torrid
furnace
blast
in
the
blinding
stinging
choking
smothering
dust
that
moved
in
golden
clouds
from
rim
to
rim
of
the
basin
in
the
blazing
scorching
strength
of
the
sun
in
the
hard
hot
sky
without
shred
or
raveling
of
cloud
in
the
creeping
silent
poison
life
of
insect
and
reptile
in
the
maddening
dryness
of
the
thirsty
vegetation
in
the
weird
beautiful
falseness
of
the
mirage
the
spirit
of
the
desert
issued
its
silent
challenge
it
was
not
the
majestic
challenge
of
the
mountains
with
their
unsealed
heights
of
peak
and
dome
and
impassable
barriers
of
rugged
crag
and
sheer
cliff
it
was
not
the
glad
challenge
of
the
untamed
wilderness
with
its
myriad
formed
life
of
tree
and
plant
and
glen
and
stream
it
was
not
the
noble
challenge
of
the
pathless
plains
nor
the
wild
challenge
of
the
restless
sea
it
was
the
silent
sinister
menacing
threat
of
a
desolation
that
had
conquered
by
cruel
waiting
and
that
lay
in
wait
still
to
conquer
with
grim
determination
nervous
energy
enduring
strength
and
a
dogged
tenacity
of
purpose
the
invading
flood
of
humanity
irresistibly
driven
by
that
master
passion
good
business
matched
its
strength
against
that
of
the
desert
in
the
season
of
its
greatest
power
steadily
mile
by
mile
acre
by
acre
and
at
times
almost
foot
by
foot
the
pioneers
wrested
their
future
farms
and
homes
from
the
dreadful
forces
that
had
held
them
for
ages
steadily
with
the
inflowing
stream
of
life
from
the
world
beyond
the
basin
rim
the
area
of
improved
lands
about
kingston
extended
and
the
work
in
the
company
town
went
on
by
midsummer
many
acres
of
alfalfa
with
egyptian
corn
and
other
grains
showed
broad
fields
of
living
green
cut
into
the
dull
dun
plain
of
the
desert
and
laced
with
silver
threads
of
water
shining
in
the
sun
save
for
occasional
brief
business
trips
to
the
city
jefferson
worth
did
not
leave
kingston
in
the
most
trying
of
those
grilling
days
of
heat
and
dust
when
a
man
skin
felt
like
cracking
parchment
and
his
eyes
burned
in
their
sockets
and
it
seemed
as
though
every
particle
of
moisture
in
his
body
was
sucked
up
by
the
dry
scorching
air
father
gave
no
sign
of
discomfort
he
accepted
the
most
situation
with
the
calmness
of
one
who
had
foreseen
it
and
to
whom
it
was
but
a
trivial
incident
inevitable
to
his
plans
when
others
their
tempers
tried
to
the
breaking
point
cursed
with
dry
querulous
curses
the
heat
the
land
the
sun
the
dust
the
company
and
their
jefferson
worth
cool
even
tones
and
unruffled
spirit
helped
them
to
a
needed
and
gave
them
a
new
and
stronger
grip
on
things
and
many
a
baffled
discouraged
and
beaten
settler
ready
to
give
up
found
in
the
man
whose
gray
face
seemed
so
incapable
of
expression
fresh
inspiration
and
new
courage
while
the
store
continued
its
policy
of
helping
the
worthy
ranchers
with
necessary
material
assistance
and
so
it
was
that
while
james
greenfield
and
his
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
were
taking
their
much
needed
vacations
and
seeking
relaxation
and
rest
from
business
cares
at
their
seaside
and
mountain
retreats
the
desert
pioneers
were
coming
more
and
more
to
jefferson
worth
for
advice
and
counsel
for
strength
and
courage
and
help
to
go
on
with
the
work
by
fall
the
position
in
the
life
of
the
new
country
seemed
to
be
securely
won
perhaps
only
jefferson
worth
himself
alone
behind
his
gray
mask
knew
the
real
value
of
his
apparent
victory
the
company
thoughtful
manager
went
out
as
the
pioneers
had
come
to
say
of
those
who
left
the
basin
for
over
a
month
and
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
spent
only
a
part
of
his
time
in
kingston
but
the
chief
engineer
refused
to
leave
even
for
a
week
to
a
pressing
invitation
from
greenfield
to
join
him
on
his
vacation
holmes
answered
that
he
could
not
get
away
all
through
the
june
rise
of
the
river
while
the
settlers
ignorant
of
the
danger
that
threatened
them
through
the
good
business
policy
of
the
company
were
risking
everything
that
capital
might
gain
its
greater
profits
the
engineer
lived
in
his
camp
at
the
intake
day
and
night
as
he
watched
the
swelling
yellow
torrent
that
threw
its
weight
against
his
work
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
surveyor
when
the
gila
and
the
little
colorado
go
on
the
warpath
and
come
down
on
top
of
a
high
colorado
flood
you
catch
hell
it
had
come
in
the
past
abe
had
declared
and
it
would
come
again
but
the
flood
waters
of
the
gila
and
the
little
colorado
did
not
come
down
on
top
of
the
larger
river
that
year
and
the
promoter
estimate
work
stood
when
the
danger
was
past
and
the
engineer
was
free
again
to
make
kingston
his
headquarters
his
acquaintance
with
jefferson
worth
grew
into
something
like
friendship
it
became
indeed
an
established
custom
for
worth
abe
lee
and
the
chief
engineer
of
the
company
to
sit
at
the
same
table
in
the
shack
restaurant
and
during
their
meals
of
canned
stuff
to
talk
over
the
work
that
held
them
from
the
comforts
and
pleasures
of
civilization
but
little
work
toward
extending
the
company
system
could
be
undertaken
during
the
hot
summer
months
it
was
difficult
for
holmes
to
hold
even
enough
men
to
maintain
that
which
was
already
in
operation
but
jefferson
worth
did
not
fare
so
badly
abe
lee
was
steadfast
of
course
while
texas
pat
and
pablo
would
as
the
irishman
said
have
fried
thimsilves
on
the
coals
av
hell
before
they
would
quit
their
job
were
there
not
letters
every
week
from
barbara
with
messages
to
the
surveyor
and
his
three
helpers
pablo
said
truly
that
there
was
no
senorita
in
the
company
so
through
abe
leadership
texas
diplomacy
pat
wisdom
and
pablo
influence
with
his
countrymen
the
worth
enterprises
did
not
suffer
for
lack
of
laborers
but
went
steadily
ahead
in
kingston
the
different
buildings
for
the
power
plant
and
lighting
system
were
nearly
completed
and
several
cottages
were
under
construction
on
lots
owned
by
jefferson
worth
while
men
and
teams
were
busy
excavating
and
hauling
materials
for
a
large
ice
plant
in
frontera
a
little
town
that
just
happened
to
grow
from
a
supply
camp
in
the
southern
end
of
the
basin
a
hotel
and
a
bank
building
were
being
erected
while
between
the
two
communities
poles
for
a
telephone
system
were
being
placed
thus
far
very
few
women
had
come
into
the
desert
when
the
torrid
summer
was
past
the
first
crops
on
the
new
ranches
harvested
and
more
comfortable
homes
prepared
they
would
come
with
the
children
to
join
the
until
then
the
new
country
would
continue
a
country
the
poorest
possible
kind
of
a
country
the
men
themselves
declared
therefore
when
late
in
september
the
king
basin
messenger
with
an
extraordinary
blare
of
trumpets
announced
the
birth
of
a
child
and
that
the
of
the
new
country
was
a
boy
the
news
was
received
with
the
greatest
excitement
in
kingston
in
frontera
at
grading
camps
and
ranches
as
the
word
was
passed
there
were
wild
and
joyous
celebrations
such
a
crowd
of
male
visitors
closed
in
on
the
humble
tent
home
to
beg
for
a
look
at
the
little
pink
stranger
that
the
pioneer
parents
were
heard
to
express
the
wish
that
they
themselves
had
never
been
born
had
the
baby
been
forced
to
carry
through
life
all
the
names
that
were
suggested
he
would
undoubtedly
have
echoed
the
parents
wish
at
an
early
age
then
came
the
terrible
word
to
kingston
brought
by
texas
joe
that
the
baby
was
tex
returning
to
town
from
a
trip
to
frontera
had
turned
a
mile
aside
to
bring
the
latest
news
of
the
baby
it
was
early
evening
and
the
light
yet
lingered
in
the
sky
back
of
no
mountains
when
the
citizens
relaxing
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
evening
meal
looked
up
to
see
him
coming
riding
like
a
mad
man
his
horse
white
with
foam
jefferson
worth
with
abe
and
holmes
coming
from
the
restaurant
had
paused
a
moment
in
front
of
the
store
before
separating
when
texas
leaped
from
his
staggering
mount
one
thought
flashed
into
the
mind
of
each
the
intake
the
river
holmes
went
white
under
his
tan
jaws
came
together
with
a
click
jefferson
worth
slim
fingers
caressed
his
chin
as
the
word
passed
quickly
through
the
town
the
crowd
that
followed
worth
and
texas
joe
into
the
store
grew
until
it
the
building
and
filled
the
street
over
all
there
was
a
solemn
hush
save
for
words
of
inquiry
or
explanation
and
of
advice
what
to
do
was
the
question
what
could
they
do
there
was
no
doctor
nearer
than
rubio
city
and
men
who
pioneer
in
a
desert
land
are
not
men
experienced
with
sickness
on
a
high
shelf
in
one
back
corner
of
the
store
there
was
a
small
stock
of
assorted
patent
medicines
desperately
they
pulled
the
bottles
down
and
studied
the
labels
and
directions
but
only
to
their
further
confusion
and
doubt
at
last
his
pockets
laden
with
everything
that
seemed
to
promise
a
possible
relief
texas
joe
set
out
on
a
fresh
horse
the
first
one
handy
to
be
followed
later
by
a
spring
wagon
drawn
by
four
fast
broncos
and
carrying
four
women
the
entire
female
population
of
kingston
had
been
mustered
by
abe
lee
whom
the
ladies
declared
then
and
there
to
be
the
only
man
of
sense
in
all
the
king
basin
for
the
first
evening
since
his
arrival
jefferson
worth
left
his
office
in
the
store
to
mingle
with
the
restless
crowds
on
the
street
that
in
knots
and
groups
discussed
in
fearful
voice
this
public
calamity
no
one
dreamed
of
retiring
no
one
had
thoughts
for
sleep
nor
indeed
for
anything
save
the
little
sufferer
in
the
tent
house
ten
miles
out
on
the
desert
they
smoked
and
talked
and
swore
softly
in
hushed
tones
and
waited
the
return
of
texas
joe
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
came
again
before
he
could
dismount
the
crowd
of
silent
men
hemmed
him
in
from
the
saddle
the
old
plainsman
looked
down
into
their
eager
solemn
faces
and
that
slow
smile
broke
over
his
features
boys
he
drawled
i
sure
proud
to
bring
the
unanimous
verdict
of
the
female
relief
expedition
sent
out
by
our
illustrious
abe
lee
the
kid
better
and
is
headed
straight
for
good
health
and
six
or
eight
square
meals
a
day
when
the
joyous
chorus
of
yells
that
would
have
startled
a
coyote
two
miles
away
subsided
tex
dismounted
and
approached
jefferson
worth
worth
them
women
commanded
me
also
to
return
to
you
with
their
compliments
and
gratitude
the
various
and
sundry
bottles
with
which
same
my
clothes
is
full
one
of
them
angels
of
mercy
it
seems
went
to
the
scene
of
action
loaded
with
a
flask
of
castor
oil
just
before
retiring
that
night
worth
said
to
his
superintendent
abe
i
going
out
in
the
morning
you
had
better
push
the
work
on
that
largest
cottage
as
fast
as
possible

an
outfit
of
furniture
and
things
as
soon
as

the
city

finished
and

porches
or
anywhere
until
i
get
back
the
hot
weather
is
about
over
and
the
hotel
will
open
up
next
week
all
right
sir
the
surveyor
answered
quietly
and
made
no
comment
on
this
unexpected
move
of
his
employer
though
his
nerves
tingled
at
the
evident
purpose
of
his
instructions
abe
lee
could
not
know
how
the
events
of
the
evening
had
awakened
in
jefferson
worth
memories
of
another
baby
in
the
that
stirred
the
heart
of
the
lonely
man
and
drove
him
to
his
daughter
without
an
hour
delay
did
abe
lee
push
the
work
on
the
house
did
he
every
man
in
jefferson
worth
employ
who
could
find
a
place
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
building
was
put
on
the
job
by
the
time
the
house
was
finished
the
furniture
had
arrived
it
was
quitting
time
and
pablo
who
with
four
mexican
laborers
had
been
at
work
grading
the
yard
and
removing
the
rubbish
that
had
accumulated
incident
to
building
dismissed
his
helpers
the
surveyor
was
gloomily
contemplating
the
pile
of
boxes
bales
and
crates
on
the
front
porch
evidently
there
was
something
not
to
the
surveyor
liking
senor
lee
the
surveyor
turned
sharply
to
face
the
mexican
whose
dark
features
were
glowing
with
pleasure
well
pardon
but
senor
lee
seems
not
pleased
is
not
the
work
well
done
the
work
is
all
right
pablo
you

done
well
it
is
not

i
was

to

the
mexican
smiled

do
he
can
do
everything
there
is
a
job

turned
again
to
the
pile
of
household
goods
si

sabe
it
is
that
la
senorita
come
pronto
an
senor
lee
would
have
the
house

abe
started
at
the
tone
of
quiet
conviction
how
the
devil
do
you
know
that
la
senorita
is
coming
he
asked
sharply
the
answer
came
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
for
what
else
does
el
senor
hurry
so
the
house
for
what
else
does
he
all
time
cry
pronto
and
go
not
much
to
the
other
work
but
stay
all
time
here
and
is
there
not
all
this
he
waved
his
hand
gracefully
to
indicate
the
household
goods
for
who
should
it
be
that
senor
lee
is
hurry
so
when

he
make
a
deeper
red
than
the
desert
color
stained
the
surveyor
thin
cheeks
as
he
said

good

of
what

sorry
but
sometime
it
will
be
if
el
senor
is
patient
the
surveyor
annoyed
at
the
mexican
talk
but
unwilling
because
of
the
spirit
that
prompted
the
words
to
speak
sharply
sought
to
dismiss
the
matter
by
changing
the
subject
he
explained
to
pablo
how
he
was
wishing
that
he
could
unpack
the
furniture
and
have
the
house
all
ready
when
worth
and

evening
at
the
office
in
the
rear
of
the
store

laid
the
situation
before
pat
and
texas
joe
could
the
three
undertake
to
have
the
furniture
unpacked
and
the
house
properly
settled
the
hotel
had
been
opened
to
receive
guests
of
course
but
texas
joe
shook
his
head
solemnly
i
pass
abe
there
ai
no
use
in
my
affirmin
that
i
knows
anything
about
such
undertakings
household
furnishin
such
as
is
proper
in
a
case
like
this
is
a
long
way
off
my
range
but
the
irishman
waxed
indignant
sich
ignorance
as
ye
two
do
be
showin
is
heathenish
he
declared
i
suppose
now
ye
wud
be
for
puttin
the
cook
stove
in
the
parlor
an
settin
up
the
piany
in
the
young
lady
budwar
the
strange
word
caught
the
attention
of
texas
instantly
an
what
might
that
be
pard
he
drawled
what
a
budwar
pat
snorted
budwar
ye
ignorant
owld
limb
is
polite
for
the
bedroom
which
in
civilization
is
not
discussed
by
thim
as
has
manners
such
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
irishman
familiarity
with
the
best
social
customs
was
not
to
be
rejected
the
morning
stage
carried
a
telegram
to
be
sent
from
deep
well
to
jefferson
worth
and
all
that
day
the
three
toiled
under
command
of
pat
when
the
evening
stage
brought
a
message
from
worth
saying
that
he
and
barbara
would
arrive
the
following
evening
they
decided
that
a
night
shift
was
necessary
and
worked
until
nearly
morning
redoubling
their
efforts
the
following
day
when
the
dusty
old
stage
with
its
four
horses
pulled
into
kingston
that
night
three
tired
and
anxious
but
joyful
desert
men
occupied
the
front
rank
of
the
waiting
crowd
before
the
new
hotel
with
all
the
grace
of
generous
curves
and
ponderous
dignity
horace
blanton
was
first
to
alight
when
he
turned
his
broad
back
to
the
common
herd
and
with
an
indescribable
air
of
proprietorship
assisted
miss
worth
to
the
ground
three
darkened
faces
scowled
with
disapproval
and
three
smothered
oaths
expressed
deep
disgust
the
excited
citizens
behind
the
three
crowded
closer
even
ynez
climbing
down
from
the
stage
was
received
with
another
cheer
by
the
delighted
men
the
irrepressible
horace
quick
to
recognize
the
spirit
of
the
company
and
ever
ready
to
do
more
than
his
part
burst
into
an
eloquent
address
of
welcome
in
behalf
of
the
entire
population
of
the
king
basin
but
the
ceremony
was
interrupted
and
the
imposing
personage
in
the
white
vest
was
thrust
roughly
aside
while
barbara
with
glad
eyes
and
hands
outstretched
greeted
the
rude
disturbers
of
the
great
man
dignity
texas
pat
lee
oh
i
glad
i
have
been
hoping
all
day
that
you
would
be
here
to
meet
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
would
never
get
here
it
has
been
the
longest
day
of
my
life
which
considering
that
the
impressive
attentions
of
horace
blanton
had
been
continuous
since
the
moment
when
he
had
forced
an
introduction
from
worth
on
the
train
that
morning
was
rather
hard
on
his
majesty
but
much
experience
in
similar
situations
had
made
horace
blanton
immune
to
such
thrusts
even
while
barbara
was
speaking
he
regained
his
place
at
her
side
with
his
voice
and
manner
of
a
personal
conductor
before
either
of
the
three
could
speak
he
followed
her
words
with
ah
miss
worth
i
see
you
already
know
some
of
our
men
texas
pat
and
abe
here
are
three
of
the
best
fellows
we
have
they
again
he
was
interrupted
the
young
woman
turned
easily
aside
to
abe
and
horace
found
himself
very
close
to
and
facing
the
tall
plainsman
and
the
heavy
shouldered
irish
boss
excuse
me
colonel
drawled
texas
in
tones
so
soft
that
no
one
in
the
noisy
crowd
could
hear
but
the
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
this
here
community
as
well
as
the
safety
of
the
country
demands
your
immediate
presence
up
the
street
without
hesitation
the
lordly
one
exclaimed
ah
thank
you
tex
miss
worth
will
excuse
me
i
sure
please
explain
my
absence
to
her
then
before
their
startled
eyes
he
faded
away
if
the
vanishing
of
such
a
bulk
can
be
so
described
a
few
minutes
after
the
passing
of
horace
blanton
tex
and
pat
also
disappeared
for
it
was
part
of
the
carefully
arranged
plot
that
barbara
uncles
were
to
see
to
the
disposal
of
the
girl
trunks
while
she
was
at
supper
at
the
hotel
with
her
father
and
abe
at
the
table
barbara
was
all
eagerness
in
her
desire
to
know
everything
about
the
work
and
the
surveyor
in
answering
her
questions
found
himself
drawn
out
of
the
dumbness
that
usually
beset
him
in
such
situations
and
our
house
asked
the
girl
when
can
i
begin
settling
you
see
i
brought
ynez
with
me
can
we
begin
in
the
morning
abe
and
could
you
spare
pat
and
tex
to
help
us
abe
glanced
at
his
employer
if
you
would
like
to
see
the
house
we
can
look
at
it
this
evening
after
supper
can
we
can
we
go
daddy
jefferson
worth
met
abe
look
with
a
twinkle
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
he
only
answered
his
eager
daughter
with
a
calm
if
you
like
they
found
the
house
with
every
window
brilliantly
lighted
and
on
the
front
porch
on
opposite
sides
of
the
door
texas
and
pat
standing
to
welcome
them
from
one
room
to
another
barbara
ran
in
laughing
delight
followed
by
the
three
who
were
perspiring
in
an
agony
of
suspense
while
jefferson
worth
looked
on
the
cook
stove
was
not
in
the
parlor
nor
was
the
piano
out
of
place
in
the
proper
room
barbara
even
found
her
trunks
there
was
a
supply
of
provisions
in
the
pantry
and
kindlings
even
ready
by
the
kitchen
stove
for
the
morning
fire
if
there
were
little
irregularities
here
and
there
barbara
with
graceful
tact
did
not
see
them
but
to
the
delight
of
the
three
men
declared
again
and
again
that
no
woman
could
have
done
it
better
the
climax
came
when
she
said
that
unless
her
father
insisted
she
would
not
even
return
to
the
hotel
that
evening
could
not
someone
go
for
the
hand
luggage
and
ynez
breathless
the
three
waited
and
when
worth
said
he
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
leave
their
own
home
for
a
hotel
tex
and
pat
could
hold
themselves
no
longer
but
made
a
wild
run
for
the
door
when
barbara
uncles
had
returned
with
the
indian
woman
and
the
grips
pat
stood
in
the
center
of
the
living
room
and
looked
curiously
about
an
expression
of
wonder
upon
his
irish
countenance
now
do
that
bate
the
divil
tell
me
he
faced
the
girl
with
mock
severity
fwhat

quare
for
an
hour
or
more
barbara
at
the
piano
sang
for
them
the
simple
songs
they
loved
while
many
a
tired
horseman
riding
past
on
his
way
to
his
lonely
desert
shack
or
to
some
rough
camp
on
the
works
paused
to
listen
to
the
sweet
voice
and
to
dream
perhaps
of
the
time
that
was
to
come
when
such
sounds
would
no
longer
seem
strange
on
the
desert
when
the
hour
came
for
texas
and
pat
and
abe
to
go
and
barbara
with
shining
eyes
tried
again
to
express
her
gratitude
while
insisting
that
they
must
always
come
to
her
home
as
to
their
own
the
three
felt
that
indeed
they
had
their
reward
and
when
later
the
girl
kissed
her
father
good
night
jefferson
worth
also
knew
in
his
lonely
heart
that
he
had
done
well
chapter
xv
barbara
comes
into
her
own
jefferson
worth
and
his
daughter
had
just
finished
their
first
breakfast
in
the
new
home
when
their
indian
servant
woman
entered
the
room
what
is
it
ynez
asked
barbara
seeing
that
the
woman
wished
to
speak
ynez
black
eyes
were
shining
and
her
voice
was
eager
as
she
answered
there
is
someone
without
waiting
for
la
senorita
someone
waiting
outside
for
me
ynez
who
is
it
asked
worth
it
is
pablo
garcia
senor
and
he
say
please
ask
la
senorita
to
come
if
la
senorita
will
go
only
to
the
door
she
can
see
with
an
expression
of
excited
interest
barbara
followed
by
her
father
went
out
on
the
porch
in
front
of
the
house
stood
pablo
holding
a
beautiful
saddle
horse
fully
equipped
and
ready
for
a
rider
the
mexican
dark
face
shone
with
the
pride
and
triumph
of
the
moment
toward
which
he
had
looked
forward
for
months
the
horse
too
as
if
sensing
the
importance
of
the
occasion
pawed
the
earth
with
his
dainty
hoofs
arched
his
neck
and
tossed
his
head
proudly
impatient
uttering
low
exclamations
and
little
cries
of
delight
the
girl
left
the
porch
and
ran
forward
greeting
pablo
and
moving
about
the
horse
admiring
the
animal
from
every
point
of
view
what
a
beauty
he
is
perfect
pablo
perfect
where
did
you
find
him
is
he
yours
his
name
her
questions
came
tumbling
from
her
lips
in
such
eager
bursts
that
pablo
answered
only
the
last
he
is
yours
senorita
his
name
el
capitan
mine
barbara
turned
to
her
father
who
explained
abe
having
told
him
the
night
before
of
the
purchase
when
her
father
finished
the
delighted
girl
announced
that
she
simply
could
wait
but
must
go
for
a
ride
immediately
running
into
the
house
she
returned
a
few
minutes
later
in
her
riding
dress
and
mounting
with
i
be
back
for
dinner
daddy
and
adios
pablo
rode
away
toward
the
open
country
while
the
mexican
and
the
banker
watched
her
out
of
sight
by
the
time
they
had
passed
the
last
of
the
tent
houses
in
the
town
barbara
and
el
capitan
were
friends
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
a
worthy
horse
appreciates
a
worthy
rider
and
the
girl
accustomed
to
riding
since
childhood
certainly
appreciated
her
mount
oh
you
beauty
she
cried
leaning
forward
in
the
saddle
to
pat
the
shining
neck
oh
you
beauty
as
though
to
return
the
compliment
and
express
his
pleasure
at
finding
such
an
agreeable
companion
el
capitan
turned
his
delicate
pointed
ears
forward
arched
his
neck
and
stepping
as
on
a
velvet
carpet
sprang
lightly
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
in
sheer
overflow
of
good
spirits
and
confidence
in
his
rider
while
the
girl
at
his
play
laughed
aloud
but
barbara
had
eyes
and
thoughts
for
more
than
her
horse
that
morning
it
was
her
first
day
in
her
desert
and
there
was
much
for
her
to
see
through
her
father
she
had
kept
in
close
touch
with
every
phase
of
the
work
of
reclaiming
the
king
basin
and
had
often
begged
him
to
take
her
with
him
into
the
new
country
now
at
last
her
wish
was
realized
she
was
where
she
could
see
with
her
own
eyes
the
seer
dream
the
seer
and
her
own
coming
true
on
either
hand
as
she
rode
stretching
away
until
all
fixed
lines
and
objects
were
lost
in
the
shifting
mirage
and
lights
of
the
desert
the
dun
plain
with
its
thin
growth
of
thirsty
vegetation
was
broken
by
the
green
cultivated
fields
newly
leveled
acres
buildings
and
stacks
of
the
ranches
with
canals
ditches
and
ponds
filled
with
water
that
reflected
the
colors
of
the
morning
everywhere
in
what
had
been
a
land
of
death
life
was
stirring
in
one
field
beside
the
road
a
herd
of
cattle
in
rich
alfalfa
lifted
their
heads
to
greet
her
in
another
a
band
of
horses
and
colts
scampered
along
with
her
as
far
as
their
fence
would
permit
as
if
seeking
her
further
acquaintance
everywhere
men
with
their
teams
were
at
work
in
the
fields
newly
won
from
the
desert
at
one
house
a
woman
was
hanging
her
weekly
wash
on
the
line
while
a
group
of
children
played
in
the
yard
as
the
girl
passed
the
woman
waved
her
hand
and
the
children
shouted
a
greeting
and
a
little
farther
on
a
perched
on
a
filled
the
world
with
liquid
music
the
atmosphere
the
glorious
light
the
odor
of
the
fields
and
the
strength
and
beauty
of
the
life
in
the
desert
with
the
spirit
and
freedom
of
the
animal
she
rode
all
appealed
with
almost
painful
intensity
to
the
girl
who
was
herself
so
richly
alive
she
felt
her
close
kinship
with
it
all
and
answered
to
it
all
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
own
young
woman
strength
she
wanted
to
cry
aloud
with
the
joy
and
gladness
of
the
victory
over
barrenness
and
desolation
it
was
her
desert
that
was
yielding
itself
to
the
strong
ones
for
them
it
had
waited
waited
through
the
ages
and
at
last
they
had
come
busy
with
her
thoughts
barbara
rode
on
until
she
had
passed
out
of
the
settled
district
of
which
kingston
was
the
center
and
found
herself
in
the
desert
save
for
the
lightly
marked
trail
she
was
following
and
the
thin
line
of
her
father
telephone
poles
that
led
southward
to
frontera
she
saw
no
sign
of
a
human
being
checking
her
horse
and
turning
she
looked
back
a
tiny
spot
of
thin
color
the
red
of
brick
the
yellow
of
new
lumber
and
the
white
of
tents
marked
kingston
the
ranches
about
the
desert
town
were
scattered
spots
of
green
scarcely
seen
at
that
distance
all
the
rest
from
the
distant
sentinels
of
the
pass
in
the
north
to
lone
mountain
in
the
south
and
from
the
purple
mountain
wall
on
the
west
to
the
of
the
mesa
on
the
east
was
the
same
dun
plain
as
she
had
always
known
it
barbara
caught
her
breath
seen
near
at
hand
the
work
accomplished
had
seemed
so
great
so
brave
seen
from
even
so
short
a
distance
as
she
had
come
it
looked
so
pitifully
small
so
helpless
the
desert
was
so
huge
so
masterful
so
dominating
in
its
silent
grandeur
in
its
awful
loneliness
all
her
life
barbara
had
seen
the
desert
from
her
home
in
rubio
city
many
many
times
she
had
ridden
into
it
and
back
a
ride
but
never
had
she
felt
the
dreadful
spirit
of
the
land
as
she
felt
it
now
alone
in
the
still
lonely
heart
of
it
she
was
afraid
with
an
unreasoning
fear
el
capitan
too
seemed
to
share
her
uneasiness
tossing
his
head
tugging
at
the
bridle
reins
and
pawing
the
ground
and
starting
nervously
he
turned
this
way
and
that
signifying
his
desire
to
be
away
but
just
as
barbara
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
his
impatience
and
her
own
feeling
of
fear
lifted
the
reins
to
turn
toward
kingston
again
he
threw
up
his
head
with
a
loud
neigh
and
with
ears
pointed
looked
away
toward
the
south
standing
rigid
and
motionless
as
a
horse
of
stone
a
cloud
of
dust
rising
from
the
trail
told
her
that
someone
was
approaching
instantly
the
girl
feeling
of
fear
vanished
she
laughed
aloud
company
is
coming
capitan
she
said
shall
we
wait
until
we
see
who
it
is
we
can
easily
run
away
if
we
do
like
his
looks
as
she
finished
speaking
the
light
wind
that
was
just
strong
enough
to
carry
the
dust
with
the
coming
rider
shifted
for
a
moment
and
revealed
the
horseman
clearly
barbara
not
wishing
to
appear
as
though
waiting
started
ahead
toward
kingston
while
the
stranger
evidently
catching
sight
of
a
horse
and
rider
on
the
road
ahead
and
desiring
company
quickened
his
pace
barbara
glanced
over
her
shoulder
shall
we
run
capitan
no
not
run
yet
but
be
ready
again
she
glanced
quickly
back
it
no
one
we
know
capitan
be
ready
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
stranger
when
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
horse
feet
on
the
sand
barbara
turned
again
this
time
openly
then
she
laughed
i
do
think
we
run
this
time
capitan
a
moment
later
the
horseman
had
overtaken
her
good
morning
holmes
how
do
you
do
miss
worth
had
the
engineer
checked
his
horse
so
suddenly
a
few
months
before
he
would
undoubtedly
have
gone
over
the
animal
head
el
capitan
also
stopped
while
the
man
and
the
girl
sat
looking
at
each
other
barbara
smiling
at
the
man
surprise
is
it
really
you
asked
holmes
at
last
or
is
it
some
new
trick
of
this
confounded
desert
he
rubbed
his
eyes
i
never
saw
a
mirage
like
this
before
and
i
do
think
the
heat
has
affected
my
brain
he
moved
his
horse
closer
could
you
shake
hands
barbara
held
out
her
hand
i
assure
you
that
i
am
very
substantial
she
laughed
and
i
am
here
to
stay
too
that
great
by
george
it
good
to
see
you
cried
holmes
so
heartily
that
the
girl
turned
away
her
face
and
caused
her
horse
to
move
ahead
the
engineer
horse
with
a
word
from
his
rider
kept
his
place
by
el
capitan
side
it
very
nice
of
you
to
say
that
but
i
did
see
you
anywhere
around
last
night
when
the
stage
arrived
abe
and
pat
and
texas
were
there
and
this
morning
even
pablo
came
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
willard
holmes
could
not
altogether
hide
his
pleasure
at
her
hinted
rebuke
so
she
had
thought
of
him
had
looked
for
him
had
missed
him
indeed
you
must
forgive
me
i
did
not
know
you
were
coming
he
said
and
explained
how
his
work
took
him
away
from
kingston
much
of
the
time
of
course
under
those
circumstances
i
must
forgive
you
agreed
barbara
then
added
seriously
i
think
i
could
forgive
anyone
who
belonged
to
this
desert
work
anything
except
one
and
that
he
was
watching
her
face
what
is
it
that
you
could
not
forgive
she
returned
his
look
steadily
do
you
know
he
drew
a
little
back
and
she
wondered
at
something
in
his
voice
and
manner
as
he
answered
yes
i
know
you
could
never
forgive
one
for
being
untrue
to
his
work
for
putting
anything
before
the
work
itself
yes
she
returned
that
is
it
i
could
never
forgive
one
who
did
that
but
how
would
you
know
how
could
you
judge
he
asked
almost
roughly
perhaps
the
very
one
whom
you
would
call
false
to
the
work
would
in
reality
be
doing
the
best
thing
for
the
work
i
have
noticed
that
after
all
those
who
have
the
loftiest
ideals
and
the
highest
visions
of
man
duty
to
man
and
all
that
are
seldom
the
ones
who
accomplish
much
of
the
actual
work
of
the
world
look
here
honestly
now
how
many
of
the
people
who
are
reclaiming
this
desert
i
mean
all
of
us
laborers
business
men
ranchers
everybody
who
has
come
in
here
to
do
this
work
how
many
of
them
do
you
think
see
a
single
thing
beyond
the
dollars
they
have
hoped
to
make
on
the
venture
whether
it
the
high
wage
paid
by
the
company
the
big
profits
of
the
business
man
or
the
heavier
crop
of
the
rancher
it
amounts
to
the
same
and
yet
you
would
insist
that
they
must
not
be
governed
by
this
desire
for
gain
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
is
this
same
desire
for
gain
that
has
driven
men
into
doing
every
really
great
thing
that
has
ever
been
done
look
carefully
into
every
great
enterprise
that
is
of
value
to
the
world
and
you
will
find
at
the
beginning
of
it
someone
reaching
for
a
dollar
or
its
equivalent
your
father
for
instance
barbara
threw
out
her
hand
protestingly
please
do
holmes
i
know
that
what
you
say
is
every
bit
true
father
and
i
have
gone
over
it
so
many
times
and
yet
i
know
i
know
that
what
i
feel
is
true
also
oh
dear
what
a
muddle
it
is
is
it
it
seems
so
wrong
to
spend
one
life
working
for
nothing
but
money
and
yet
all
the
really
good
work
in
the
world
is
done
by
those
who
do
work
to
do
good
at
all
but
for
what
they
get
out
of
it
i
suppose
now
that
you
stayed
in
the
desert
all
this
past
summer
and
worked
so
hard
without
any
vacation
at
all
just
for
your
salary
how
did
you
know
that
i
took
no
vacation
father
told
me
you
seem
to
have
made
quite
an
impression
on
my
father
he
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
you
but
i
want
to
know
did
you
stay
in
the
desert
for
money
holmes
wondered
if
she
knew
the
danger
that
threatened
the
settlers
because
of
the
unsubstantial
character
of
the
company
structures
perhaps
he
said
it
was
to
save
my
professional
reputation
that
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
would
it
barbara
laughed
i
do
think
that
your
taking
a
vacation
would
have
lost
you
your
reputation
that
wo
do
chief
engineer
for
some
reason
barbara
seemed
highly
pleased
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
the
man
thought
of
those
anxious
days
and
nights
at
the
intake
when
the
safety
of
the
success
of
the
whole
king
basin
project
hung
on
the
whim
of
an
uncertain
river
but
he
did
not
explain
to
barbara
nor
did
he
tell
her
that
a
vacation
would
have
made
no
difference
in
his
salary
i
tell
you
why
you
stayed
with
the
work
in
the
desert
this
summer
holmes
she
said
and
in
her
voice
was
a
note
of
pleased
triumph
why
he
asked
because
you
are
learning
the
language
of
the
country
for
an
instant
he
was
puzzled
then
he
remembered
the
evening
he
had
said
si
senorita
i
suppose
one
could
not
help
learning
a
little
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
could
he
not
if
he
had
ancestors
came
the
answer
holmes
flushed
what
a
snob
i
must
have
seemed
to
you
that
day
he
said
in
deep
disgust
at
the
recollection
of
his
first
attempt
to
impress
the
western
girl
with
the
importance
of
his
place
in
life
i
do
think
snob
is
just
the
word
she
answered
i
did
mind
that
ancestor
business
and
all
that
one
bit
in
fact
i
think
i
rather
enjoyed
it
you
were
such
a
tenderfoot
but
there
was
something
else
i
did
mind
did
you
know
that
there
was
a
time
when
i
hated
you
with
my
whole
heart
miss
worth
it
so
i
even
promised
myself
that
i
would
never
speak
to
you
again
never
then
i
came
after
awhile
to
understand
how
foolish
it
was
of
me
to
blame
you
and
father
told
me
so
much
of
your
work
here
this
summer
that
i
became
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
i
telling
you
now
because
you
see
i
have
come
here
to
stay
and
to
be
in
a
way
a
tiny
little
part
in
this
great
work
you
are
doing
and
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
so
that
we
can
start
square
again
but
miss
worth
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
i
know
it
was
foolish
of
me
for
you
were
not
at
all
to
blame
but
i
could
help
it
it
is
all
over
though
and
we
are
square
now
or
will
be
when
you
have
said
that
you
forgive
me
but
i
do
know
what
you
mean
what
on
earth
did
i
do
she
looked
straight
at
him
ca
you
even
guess
i
have
the
ghost
of
an
idea
well
i
glad
you
have
she
declared
even
if
it
does
make
me
appear
so
foolish
it
was
because
the
seer
was
discharged
and
you
were
put
in
his
place
but
i
oh
i
know
all
about
it
she
interrupted
you
did
do
it
you
were
not
to
blame
the
company
did
it
because
it
was
good
business
i
told
you
it
was
all
over
now
but
please
i
do
think
we
better
talk
about
it
only
just
for
you
to
say
that
you
forgive
me
i
had
to
tell
you
for
that
you
see
then
the
once
carefully
proper
willard
holmes
did
a
thing
that
would
have
astonished
his
most
intimate
eastern
friends
beyond
expression
reining
his
horse
close
to
el
capitan
he
held
out
his
hand
to
barbara
shake
pard
you
the
squarest
girl
i
ever
knew
it
was
no
flimsy
ceremony
but
a
grip
that
made
the
man
blood
move
more
quickly
unconsciously
as
he
felt
the
warm
strength
in
the
touch
of
the
hand
he
leaned
toward
her
with
quick
eagerness
and
barbara
who
was
looking
straight
into
his
face
with
the
open
frankness
of
one
man
to
another
started
and
drew
back
a
little
turning
her
head
aside
for
some
distance
they
rode
in
silence
then
she
began
questioning
him
about
his
life
in
the
desert
and
all
the
rest
of
the
way
home
made
him
talk
of
the
work
so
dear
to
her
heart
as
he
talked
and
the
girl
watched
his
strong
bronzed
face
and
listened
to
his
words
she
found
something
in
his
voice
and
manner
that
was
not
there
that
day
when
she
introduced
him
to
her
desert
there
was
a
an
enthusiasm
a
purpose
that
was
good
to
hear
at
the
door
of
her
new
home
when
he
pleading
his
work
would
not
stay
for
lunch
but
promised
to
call
in
the
evening
she
bade
him
adios
in
the
soft
tongue
of
the
southland
and
when
he
had
wheeled
his
horse
and
was
riding
away
barbara
turned
on
the
porch
to
look
after
him
watching
the
khaki
clad
figure
that
was
so
easily
at
home
in
the
saddle
and
that
with
the
loping
horse
seemed
so
much
a
part
of
the
country
the
girl
wondered
at
the
change
that
was
being
wrought
by
the
wild
land
upon
the
man
from
the
eastern
city
indeed
she
thought
he
is
learning
the
language
of
the
desert
and
she
too
was
glad
when
holmes
arrived
at
the
company
headquarters
the
general
manager
shifted
his
cigar
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
looking
him
over
critically
buenas
dias
senor
cried
the
engineer
gaily
throwing
his
sombrero
quirt
and
gloves
on
the
floor
and
helping
himself
from
the
box
of
cigars
on
the
desk
holmes
was
still
thinking
in
the
language
of
barbara
land
humph
grunted
the
slender
man
at
the
desk
i
said
to
you
when
you
passed
the
office
also
i
bowed
my
best
new
york
bow
but
you
were
too
engaged
to
see
were
you
practicing
your
greaser
lingo
on
her
i
suppose
she
talks
it
like
a
native
she
talks
a
language
you
would
not
understand
my
friend
said
holmes
coolly
lighting
a
cigar
probably
not
agreed
the
other
who
am
i
that
i
should
understand
the
words
of
a
being
of
such
exalted
rank
the
whole
fool
town
is
crazy
over
her
already
i
heard
nothing
but
miss
worth
miss
worth
all
morning
you
would
think
the
hotel
was
a
ladies
sewing
circle
every
man
on
the
street
is
wearing
his
sunday
clothes
and
walks
with
his
head
twisted
over
his
shoulder
for
fear
he
will
miss
a
glimpse
of
her
horace
blanton
is
the
man
of
the
hour
he
came
in
with
her
last
night
and
is
arranging
a
public
reception
talking
like
the
business
manager
of
a
greek
goddess
and
now
here
you
go
riding
down
the
street
with
her
so
interested
that
you
ca
even
see
me
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
you
certainly
have
lost
no
time
holmes
scowled
that
fellow
blanton
is
an
officious
ass
he
growled
and
you
he
checked
himself
go
on
go
on
cried
the
delighted
burk
do
spare
me
in
the
name
of
the
goddess
smite
the
engineer
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
though
he
spoke
sharply
cut
it
out
burk
i
met
miss
worth
in
rubio
city
when
i
landed
fresh
from
new
york
she
a
mighty
charming
girl
whom
you
be
as
glad
as
anybody
to
know
she
was
riding
over
in
the
west
district
this
morning
and
i
overtook
her
on
my
way
in
of
course
we
came
on
together
have
you
heard
from
uncle
jim
the
manager
dropped
his
bantering
tone
instantly
and
taking
an
open
letter
from
his
desk
scanned
it
thoughtfully
as
he
answered
he
be
here
saturday
he
not
at
all
pleased
holmes
with
my
report
on
the
worth
operations
our
friend
jeff
getting
altogether
too
strong
a
grip
on
things
it
beats
all
the
way
he
hops
into
a
game
and
draws
all
the
high
cards
before
you
know
he
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
the
thoughtful
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
was
evidently
worried
holmes
made
no
reply
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
letter
in
his
hand
burk
asked
how
are
you
getting
on
with
the
survey
of
the
south
central
district
black
finished
yesterday
i
brought
in
the
data
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
no
good
burk
the
land
is
a
rough
jumble
of
small
hummocks
covered
with
a
heavy
growth
of
greasewood
and
mesquite
and
practically
all
of
it
lies
so
high
that
we
could
never
get
the
water
on
it
at
all
burk
considered
do
you
know
whether
abe
lee
ever
went
over
that
district
holmes
stiffened
no
he
never
worked
in
that
part
of
the
basin
at
all
but
what
the
deuce
has
lee
to
do
with
it
black
is
a
graduate
engineer
and
as
good
a
man
as
ever
looked
over
a
transit
if
you
trust
the
men
i
send
out
why
wow
wow
cried
burk
keep
your
shirt
on
old
man
i
not
making
insinuations
against
your
pet
surveyor
i
merely
asked
for
information
now
if
you
please
turn
your
south
central
data
over
to
your
office
force
and
tell
them
to
get
it
in
shape
by
saturday
without
fail

order

worth
operations
the
crowd
that
waited
in
front
of
the
new
hotel
for
the
arrival
of
the
stage
the
evening
james
greenfield
came
to
kingston
was
unusually
large
the
king
basin
messenger
had
announced
the
coming
of
the
promoter
and
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
and
the
pioneers
had
assembled
to
see
the
famous
capitalist
whose
power
in
the
money
world
was
making
possible
the
reclamation
of
the
desert
greenfield
greeting
in
the
lobby
under
the
perspiring
efforts
of
horace
blanton
soon
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
public
reception
with
his
manager
to
introduce
the
prominent
citizens
and
horace
who
was
never
farther
than
a
yard
from
the
capitalist
elbow
to
assist
in
receiving
them
the
man
from
new
york
entered
graciously
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
and
when
the
man
in
the
white
vest
intoxicated
by
the
atmosphere
of
greatness
burst
forth
in
a
speech
of
welcome
setting
forth
the
wonders
of
the
king
basin
the
marvelous
growth
and
future
of
kingston
the
greatness
of
greenfield
and
quite
incidentally
the
greatness
of
horace
p
blanton
all
in
behalf
of
the
people
the
easterner
replied
with
a
few
modest
remarks
in
which
he
hinted
at
even
greater
things
to
come
promising
by
subtle
suggestion
unlimited
wealth
for
all
who
would
invest
their
money
and
their
lives
in
the
king
basin
project
then
greenfield
slipped
away
with
willard
holmes
to
his
room
the
friendship
between
the
engineer
own
parents
and
his
benefactor
had
been
lifelong
and
very
close
it
was
a
story
years
ago
forgotten
by
the
world
of
how
grace
winton
had
chosen
one
of
the
two
college
chums
and
why
the
other
had
never
married
in
the
repeated
business
failures
of
his
old
schoolmate
and
the
consequent
loss
of
his
fortune
the
successful
financier
had
proven
himself
many
times
a
friend
in
need
and
through
the
long
illness
of
the
man
who
had
been
successful
in
winning
the
woman
they
both
loved
greenfield
with
his
wealth
had
been
steadfast
in
his
thoughtful
care
when
baby
willard
mother
died
soon
after
the
death
of
his
father
she
knowing
the
heart
of
the
man
whose
love
for
her
had
kept
him
childless
committed
to
him
her
only
child
and
greenfield
accepting
the
trust
had
taken
the
boy
into
his
life
and
heart
as
his
own
son
after
the
loss
of
william
greenfield
his
only
brother
james
greenfield
whose
power
in
the
financial
world
was
steadily
increasing
had
no
one
to
intimately
share
his
success
but
young
holmes
and
when
willard
had
finished
his
school
and
chosen
his
profession
the
older
man
used
the
influence
of
his
own
position
to
give
the
young
engineer
every
advantage
as
the
two
men
faced
each
other
now
after
the
longest
separation
they
had
ever
known
the
company
president
studied
his
chief
engineer
with
interest
well
willard
my
boy
he
said
at
last
how
do
you
like
it
say
but
you
are
looking
fine
you
always
were
a
handsome
youngster
but
you
you
improving
young
man
i
blessed
if
you
do
look
like
a
work
of
art
done
in
bronze
he
laughed
with
the
pleasure
of
his
own
conceit
and
the
other
laughed
with
him
wait
until
this
sun
gets
a
shot
at
you
uncle
jim
humph
i
suppose
you
think
it
will
make
me
into
some
sort
of
an
hideous
old
idol
i
do
propose
to
stay
long
enough
to
give
it
a
chance
he
added
grimly
and
as
he
finished
a
shadow
fell
over
his
face
and
the
laughter
died
out
of
his
voice
what
the
matter
do
you
like
the
west
uncle
jim
i
hate
it
and
with
good
reason
do
you
get
too
interested
out
here
willard
we
clean
up
a
nice
little
pile
out
of
this
scheme
and
get
back
home
where
we
belong
i
miss
you
like
the
deuce
boy
the
engineer
started
to
say
something
about
the
work
but
greenfield
held
up
his
hand
not
a
word
about
business
willard
take
that
up
tell
me
where
i
can
get
a
shave
and
then
have
dinner
and
after
that
a
quiet
evening
together
holmes
laughed
we
have
a
barber
all
right
uncle
jim
he
landed
with
his
outfit
this
afternoon
there
was
no
place
for
him
and
the
freighter
unloaded
him
on
a
vacant
lot
about
a
block
west
of
the
hotel
it
been
a
long
time
since
most
of
us
have
seen
a
real
barber
and
the
boys
could
wait
trade
came
with
such
a
rush
that
he
set
up
his
chair
in
the
street
and
has
been
doing
a
business
ever
since
they
say
he
all
right
too
but
it
looks
funny
greenfield
his
curiosity
aroused
and
being
really
in
need
of
a
shave
sought
out
the
shopless
barber
he
was
easily
found
for
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
to
witness
the
arrival
of
the
great
financier
james
greenfield
had
already
drifted
to
the
scene
of
kingston
other
chief
attraction
piled
in
a
vacant
lot
was
the
necessary
furniture
for
a
shop
but
only
the
chair
was
in
use
a
nearby
held
the
instruments
of
the
craft
while
a
bucket
of
water
a
tin
basin
and
a
supply
of
towels
completed
the
arrangements
the
delighted
crowd
filled
the
air
with
good
natured
chaff
and
laughter
as
the
customers
compared
notes
and
attempted
to
express
their
emotion
at
finding
themselves
properly
groomed
greenfield
highly
amused
at
the
novel
sight
pushed
his
way
well
into
the
circle
next
shouted
the
man
with
the
brush
and
razors
in
a
voice
that
was
heard
a
block
away
some
joker
shouted
your
turn
greenfield
and
greenfield
greenfield
chimed
the
crowd
amid
yells
of
delight
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
took
his
place
in
the
chair
as
the
barber
worked
he
talked
never
before
in
all
his
professional
career
had
he
been
so
prominently
in
the
public
eye

to
ship
it
to
kingston
in
the
king
basin
country
says
he
need
a
good
barber
down
there
and
i
figured
that
if
i
got
the
shop
ready
i
could
find
the
man
to
run
it
how
would
you
like
to
tackle
the
job
i
send
you
and
your
outfit
to
kingston
and
sell
you
your
shop
on
good
time
too
for
just
what
it
cost
me
an
here
i
am
next
greenfield
slipped
from
the
chair
and
silently
tendered
the
talkative
barber
a
five
dollar
bill
as
the
barber
was
counting
out
the
change
the
eastern
financier
heard
behind
him
murmurs
of
hearty
approval
and
admiration
of
jefferson
worth
the
barber
story
had
made
a
deep
impression
and
certainly
no
one
in
the
crowd
was
more
deeply
impressed
than
was
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
at
dinner
that
evening
the
boy
with
the
weekly
edition
of
the
messenger
came
into
the
dining
room
burk
taking
his
copy
glanced
once
at
the
first
page
folded
it
carefully
and
laid
the
sheet
before
his
employer
with
the
headlines
of
a
leading
article
uppermost
greenfield
read
the
citizens
bank
of
kingston
jefferson
worth
owns
the
building
opposite
the
opera
house
and
has
organized
a
bank
greenfield
did
not
need
to
read
further
who
did
you
say
was
building
the
opera
house
block
he
asked
the
manager
it
is
owned
by
a
syndicate
the
local
man
in
charge
sits
at
that
table
in
the
corner
he
nodded
toward
a
clean
young
fellow
who
was
enjoying
his
dinner
and
chatting
with
abe
lee
in
the
lobby
a
few
minutes
later
greenfield
whispered
to
holmes
introduce
me
to
that
young
man
willard
his
order
was
easily
obeyed
and
soon
in
a
corner
the
president
and
his
new
acquaintance
were
chatting
pleasantly
over
cigars
furnished
by
the
new
yorker
that
building
of
yours
seems
to
be
a
very
creditable
piece
of
work
offered
greenfield
the
investment
ought
to
pay
big
later
on
but
is
it
rather
heavy
for
the
present
size
of
the
town
the
other
smiled
pleasantly
true
but
you
see
we
are
not
building
it
for
a
town
of
this
size
greenfield
we
expect
kingston
to
grow
rapidly
and
we
realize
the
importance
of
being
on
the
ground
first
that
right
too
returned
greenfield
with
the
capital
to
do
it
that
is
undoubtedly
the
right
plan
i
understand
you
represent
a
coast
syndicate
again
the
young
man
smiled
that
is
the
general
understanding
greenfield
and
until
i
have
not
been
at
liberty
to
contradict
it
i
can
tell
you
now
however
that
the
syndicate
which
is
putting
up
that
building
is
jefferson
worth
greenfield
was
too
to
give
vent
to
the
slightest
expression
of
surprise
his
tone
was
courtesy
itself
as
he
replied
indeed
worth
seems
to
be
doing
a
great
deal
for
kingston
then
the
talk
shifted
easily
into
other
channels
until
the
president
found
opportunity
to
leave
his
companion
rejoining
his
manager
and
holmes
greenfield
requested
burk
presence
in
his
room
and
once
there
threw
aside
the
mask
of
politeness
making
it
clearly
evident
in
words
chosen
for
forcefulness
rather
than
politeness
that
he
did
not
approve
of
the
situation
that
had
developed
under
the
thoughtful
manager
eye
and
now
he
finished
send
the
proprietor
of
this
hotel
up
here
the
uncomfortable
burk
obeyed
when
the
landlord
arrived
with
an
anxious
face
greenfield
was
his
courteous
affable
self
again
wheeler
he
said
there
is
a
little
business
proposition
i
wish
to
lay
before
you
while
i
am
here
and
i
thought
it
better
to
mention
it
this
evening
so
that
you
can
have
time
to
think
it
over
and
give
me
your
answer
before
i
leave
i
can
see
of
course
that
this
hotel
building
and
all
represents
quite
an
investment
and
that
for
a
time
the
returns
will
not
be
large
i
do
know
of
course
how
much
capital
you
have
to
swing
it
but
i
can
see
that
without
good
substantial
backing
the
enterprise
might
not
hold
up
which
would
be
very
bad
for
the
reputation
of
the
town
in
which
as
you
know
our
company
is
so
heavily
interested
now
if
we
could
bring
about
some
alliance
between
you
and
the
company
it
would
be
a
good
thing
all
around
do
you
see
yes
sir
i
see
this
is
a
big
undertaking
for
kingston
as
conditions
are
now
but
later
it
is
bound
to
be
a
good
paying
investment
and
we
realize
the
importance
of
getting
in
on
the
ground
floor
but
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
consider
or
make
any
proposition
whatever
until
i
have
consulted
the
owner
the
owner
yes
sir
i
was
told
that
you
were
the
proprietor
your
name
is
on
the
hotel
stationery
i
have
only
a
very
small
interest
my
associate
would
not
permit
his
name
to
be
used
at
all
i
may
tell
you
however
confidentially
that
worth
owns
the
building
and
practically
all
the
hotel
equipment
you
can
easily
place
your
proposition
before
him
whatever
he
does
i
am
bound
to
accept
james
greenfield
chewed
his
cigar
in
savage
silence
clearly
it
was
time
that
he
visited
his
town
do
you
know
where
worth
is
this
evening
he
asked
as
mildly
as
he
could
speak
in
his
office
i
think
would
you
be
good
enough
to
send
him
a
message
that
i
would
like
to
see
him
on
a
matter
of
importance
i
will
wait
in
my
room
certainly
sir
when
the
landlord
was
gone
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
walked
the
floor
carefully
reviewing
his
dealings
with
jefferson
worth
from
the
beginning
so
this
was
what
the
banker
had
up
his
sleeve
when
he
declined
to
join
the
company
he
was
interrupted
by
the
boy
with
worth
answer
worth
would
be
in
his
office
at
the
store
until
ten
the
eastern
capitalist
made
his
way
to
the
little
room
in
the
store
where
jefferson
worth
sat
at
his
battered
old
desk
how
do
you
do
sit
down
came
the
colorless
greeting
as
the
western
man
with
one
hand
closed
the
door
and
with
the
other
motioned
toward
the
chair
at
the
end
of
the
desk
then
seating
himself
again
in
his
own
chair
he
waited
behind
his
mask
well
worth
i
see
you
decided
to
come
into
the
basin
after
all
i
concluded
to
make
a
few
small
investments
came
the
exact
reply
greenfield
laughed
shortly
yes
this
store
the
electric
power
plant
and
system
the
bank
building
and
bank
the
opera
house
block
the
hotel
the
telephone
system
the
company
president
tone
and
manner
were
intended
to
imply
that
he
understood
clearly
the
other
attitude
and
that
he
recognized
a
come
now
worth
let
get
down
to
good
business
it
poor
policy
for
you
and
me
to
go
against
each
other
you
know
what
there
is
in
it
for
all
of
us
if
we
hang
together
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
we
ca
afford
and
that
we
do
want
to
fight
each
other
what
sort
of
a
deal
will
it
take
to
get
you
into
the
company
i
tell
you
squarely
we
are
going
to
make
it
almighty
hot
for
any
independent
operator
who
tries
to
start
in
here
i
must
decline
to
consider
any
proposition
at
all
from
the
company
mr
greenfield
in
the
silence
that
followed
greenfield
sought
in
vain
to
look
back
of
that
gray
mask
he
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
business
career
powerless
to
make
the
next
move
in
the
game
and
somewhere
back
in
his
active
brain
a
warning
signal
flashed
go
slow
very
well
worth
he
said
at
last
rising
to
go
when
you
are
ready
to
consider
the
matter
let
me
know
in
the
meantime
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
good
night
outside
the
store
greenfield
paused
irresolutely
as
one
hesitates
whose
mind
is
too
preoccupied
to
direct
his
steps
then
his
eye
caught
the
gleam
of
light
from
the
printing
office
across
the
street
next
to
the
company
building
a
moment
later
he
greeted
the
young
man
who
edited
and
published
the
messenger
you
seem
to
be
pretty
well
fixed
here
offered
greenfield
after
the
usual
greetings
seems
to
me
your
prospects
are
mighty
good
for
a
young
man
your
profits
ought
to
be
big
if
you
can
hold
on
and
grow
with
the
development
of
the
country
yes
sir
i
feel
that
our
chances
are
good
kingston
is
growing
rapidly
and
we
are
in
on
the
ground
floor
greenfield
looked
at
him
sharply
as
he
uttered
the
now
familiar
expression
you
have
all
the
capital
you
need
we
are
doing
very
well
so
far
i
have
been
looking
your
paper
over
with
some
care
the
president
went
on
and
i
believe
you
have
the
right
idea
a
newspaper
is
a
powerful
factor
in
a
great
enterprise
like
this
and
of
course
i
am
anxious
that
everything
that
makes
for
the
advancement
of
our
project
should
succeed
i
would
be
sorry
to
see
you
crippled
in
any
way
for
lack
of
funds
if
you
are
open
to
consider
the
matter
i
should
be
glad
to
take
a
good
big
interest
with
you
and
to
undertake
to
back
you
handsomely
i
do
think
my
partner
who
really
furnished
all
the
capital
would
sell
sir
ah
then
you
are
not
alone
no
sir
jefferson
worth
practically
owns
the
plant
the
first
thing
that
met
greenfield
eye
as
he
stepped
through
the
doorway
on
his
return
to
the
hotel
was
the
broad
back
of
horace
blanton
who
carried
away
as
usual
by
the
importance
of
the
occasion
was
orating
to
a
group
of
strangers
it
should
be
said
that
save
when
the
kingston
citizens
were
in
a
certain
mood
horace
orated
usually
to
strangers
in
this
case
so
convincing
was
his
logic
so
eloquent
his
flights
of
rhetoric
so
irresistible
his
appeals
that
greenfield
saw
the
fat
neck
of
him
where
it
showed
between
the
fat
shoulder
and
the
hat
grow
red
with
the
fierceness
of
his
eloquence
there
is
no
question
in
the
world
gentlemen
that
by
long
odds
the
most
able
financier
in
the
west
is
my
friend
jefferson
worth
his
startling
genius
as
a
captain
of
industry
is
equaled
only
by
his
splendid
public
spirit
and
his
magnificent
generosity
to
everyone
who
needs
a
helping
hand
look
what
he
has
accomplished
for
kingston
while
only
a
few
of
us
who
were
on
the
inside
knew
what
he
was
doing
our
opera
house
our
bank
our
newspaper
our
telephone
lines
our
ice
plant
and
our
power
plant
which
night
for
the
first
time
will
illuminate
the
heavens
think
of
it
electric
lights
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
that
since
god
made
it
has
known
only
the
light
of
the
stars
i
maintain
gentlemen
that
it
is
the
duty
of
every
soul
in
the
king
basin
to
be
present
at
the
celebration
of
the
splendid
accomplishment
and
in
honor
to
my
friend
worth
not
only
has
this
wizard
given
us
in
kingston
the
blessings
of
modern
civilization
but
there
is
scarcely
a
rancher
for
miles
around
whom
he
has
not
aided
materially
by
furnishing
him
with
needed
supplies
from
the
big
department
store
or
by
advancing
him
necessary
capital
i
am
proud
gentlemen
proud
to
call
such
a
public
benefactor
my
friend
kingston
is
proud
of
her
most
distinguished
citizen
the
whole
king
basin
country
is
proud
of
him
i
oh
excuse
me
a
minute
gentlemen
as
i
see
my
friend
greenfield
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
has
just
arrived
greenfield
made
an
effort
to
escape
he
had
heard
quite
enough
but
it
was
useless
the
bulk
of
the
orator
barred
the
way
the
kingly
countenance
of
horace
blanton
compelled
recognition
my
dear
greenfield
how
are
you
the
voice
was
the
anxious
voice
of
unmistakable
disinterested
affection
you
have
arrived
at
a
most
auspicious
moment
i
have
promised
our
people
that
you
would
address
them
at
the
public
meeting
evening
in
the
opera
house
it
is
impossible
ah
blanton
i
never
make
public
speeches
before
greenfield
had
finished
his
curt
reply
the
perspiring
one
had
him
by
the
arm
in
friendly
familiarity
and
with
the
president
last
word
the
answer
came
in
a
low
confidential
tone
of
complete
understanding
of
course
you
understand
that
i
have
arranged
this
little
affair
simply
to
encourage
every
one
to
do
his
part
to
boom
kingston
it
is
to
our
interest
you
know
to
keep
things
going
until
a
late
hour
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
with
his
general
manager
and
chief
engineer
in
the
private
office
discussed
jefferson
worth
operations
and
his
growing
influence
in
the
king
basin
country
james
greenfield
had
evidently
forgotten
his
determination
to
spend
the
evening
with
willard
holmes
it
was
notable
that
the
president
and
his
manager
did
most
of
the
talking
the
engineer
was
for
the
most
part
a
silent
listener
when
appealed
to
directly
he
answered
briefly
giving
such
information
as
he
had
at
his
command
and
several
times
his
answers
caused
greenfield
to
look
at
him
with
questioning
sharpness
once
the
older
man
remarked
i
believe
you
wrote
me
burk
that
worth
daughter
had
arrived
and
that
they
are
to
make
their
home
in
kingston
is
she
likely
to
prove
a
factor
in
the
matter
of
her
popularity
and
influence
sometimes
a
woman
you
know
burk
cigar
shifted
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
head
was
cocked
to
one
side
ask
holmes
he
muttered
with
a
grin
i
think
you
better
leave
miss
worth
out
of
this
uncle
jim
said
holmes
so
sharply
that
barbara
name
was
not
mentioned
again
which
does
not
mean
at
all
that
greenfield
had
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
you
have
that
south
central
district
survey
ready
he
asked
i
believe
the
boys
have
it
in
shape
answered
burk
the
engineer
laid
a
map
before
them
explained
the
boundaries
of
the
proposed
district
the
line
of
the
proposed
canal
and
on
another
sheet
pointed
out
the
character
of
the
land
with
the
elevations
that
made
irrigation
of
the
larger
part
of
the
tract
impossible
you
can
vouch
for
the
correctness
of
these
figures
willard
asked
greenfield
at
last
certainly
sir
black
is
one
of
the
best
men
we
have
and
it
is
your
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
heavy
loss
to
the
company
to
build
this
canal
and
attempt
to
develop
this
section
i
am
sure
that
it
would
sir
the
district
is
practically
worthless
all
right
boys
that
will
be
all
for
this
evening
we
will
start
on
that
inspection
tour
day
after
instead
of
in
the
morning
as
i
had
planned
i
have
a
little
business
with
our
friend
worth
morning
chapter
xvii
james
greenfield
seeks
an
advantage
the
next
morning
jefferson
worth
in
his
office
in
the
store
building
again
received
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
james
greenfield
with
outstretched
hand
was
quite
cordial
in
his
greeting
i
owe
you
an
apology
sir
i
did
not
know
until
my
return
to
the
hotel
last
night
of
the
demonstration
to
be
held
this
evening
in
your
honor
and
in
celebration
of
the
turning
on
of
our
new
lights
or
i
should
have
congratulated
you
sooner
i
am
glad
the
people
of
kingston
are
recognizing
you
in
this
public
manner
permit
me
to
express
my
personal
appreciation
also
thank
you
said
worth
from
behind
his
mask
i
figure
that
my
interests
in
kingston
will
pan
out
all
right
some
day
greenfield
dropped
his
complimentary
manner
and
came
at
once
to
business
look
here
worth
i
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
i
mentioned
last
night
i
can
see
the
strength
of
your
position
here
and
i
appreciate
the
value
of
your
operations
in
the
development
of
this
country
which
mean
of
course
an
added
value
to
the
property
and
interests
we
do
want
to
fight
you
such
things
are
bad
for
all
concerned
we
would
all
lose
money
and
it
would
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
whole
project
if
you
wo
come
in
with
us
will
you
consider
a
proposition
that
you
can
handle
independently
what
is
your
proposition
it
is
this
in
forming
our
plans
for
extending
the
company
system
we
have
laid
out
a
new
district
the
south
central
before
placing
the
water
rights
on
the
open
market
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
make
a
deal
whereby
the
development
of
the
district
would
be
assured
and
at
the
same
time
we
would
be
free
to
use
our
forces
in
still
further
extensions
as
you
know
the
settlers
are
coming
in
so
rapidly
now
that
we
need
all
our
equipment
to
get
the
water
to
them
as
fast
as
they
are
located
my
proposition
is
this
we
will
sell
you
the
entire
amount
of
water
rights
covering
this
south
central
district
sixty
thousand
shares
at
the
lowest
figure
we
can
make
you
to
build
your
own
canals
and
structures
the
entire
district
will
thus
be
altogether
in
your
hands
to
handle
as
you
see
fit
we
of
course
being
bound
only
to
deliver
into
your
canals
the
amount
of
water
called
for
by
the
regular
contract
under
which
the
rights
are
sold
you
have
already
completed
the
survey
and
formed
the
district
we
have
the
surveys
have
just
been
completed
we
are
all
ready
to
go
ahead
with
our
work
and
to
sell
the
water
greenfield
did
not
say
that
the
company
was
ready
to
go
to
work
on
this
particular
district
nor
did
he
say
that
the
stock
would
be
offered
for
sale
save
to
worth
the
president
of
course
expected
worth
to
apply
his
statement
to
the
particular
tract
of
land
under
consideration
and
to
accept
it
as
establishing
beyond
question
the
value
of
the
south
central
district
if
jefferson
worth
noted
the
general
character
of
greenfield
answer
he
gave
no
sign
where
is
the
land
located
if
you
will
step
over
to
our
office
i
can
show
you
the
maps
when
jefferson
worth
saw
the
boundaries
of
the
south
central
district
showing
the
course
of
dry
river
and
the
san
felipe
trail
for
the
first
time
his
long
tapering
fingers
tapping
softly
the
arm
of
his
chair
smoothing
his
gray
cheek
and
caressing
his
chin
betrayed
emotion
the
spot
where
the
san
felipe
trail
crossed
dry
river
and
where
the
banker
and
his
party
had
found
the
baby
girl
was
just
within
the
boundary
of
the
district
apparently
studying
the
map
before
him
barbara
father
sat
motionless
save
for
those
nervous
fingers
and
greenfield
thinking
that
the
mind
was
intent
upon
the
business
under
consideration
spoke
no
word
but
jefferson
worth
was
not
thinking
of
business
he
was
seeing
again
a
baby
girl
who
shrank
back
from
his
outstretched
arms
as
though
in
fear
but
that
face
betrayed
no
hint
of
emotion
and
when
the
banker
spoke
again
it
was
to
ask
mechanically
where
is
your
engineer
greenfield
looked
inquiringly
at
burk
the
manager
touched
a
button
on
his
desk
to
the
young
man
who
answered
the
signal
the
manager
said
charlie
if
holmes
is
in
the
building
please
ask
him
to
step
in
here
a
moment
presently
the
chief
engineer
stood
before
them
an
expression
of
surprise
flashed
over
his
bronzed
face
as
he
saw
worth
from
the
banker
his
glance
moved
swiftly
to
burk
and
greenfield
then
fell
on
the
map
before
the
three
men
instantly
he
saw
greenfield
purpose
but
what
did
they
want
of
him
surely
they
would
not
dare
ask
him
to
make
a
false
statement
regarding
the
surveys
he
could
not
interfere
it
was
not
his
business
it
was
the
creed
of
his
type
that
in
business
transactions
every
man
must
take
care
of
himself
but
the
company
must
not
ask
him
to
lie
for
them
as
these
thoughts
went
through
his
mind
his
form
straightened
and
his
eyes
shot
a
warning
almost
a
defiant
look
at
his
two
superiors
greenfield
saw
and
signaled
caution
burk
saw
and
smiled
but
none
of
the
three
company
men
could
have
told
whether
jefferson
worth
who
was
bending
over
the
map
saw
or
not
before
the
others
could
speak
the
banker
without
looking
up
said
i
just
wanted
to
ask
holmes
whether
you
can
tell
me
about
the
character
of
the
soil
in
this
new
district
the
soil
worth
is
i
believe
as
good
as
there
is
in
the
basin
the
three
men
awaited
the
next
question
with
breathless
interest
thank
you
holmes
greenfield
i
will
consider
the
proposition
the
president
and
manager
could
scarcely
believe
their
ears
the
engineer
vanished
jefferson
worth
continued
how
long
have
you
planned
to
be
in
the
basin
this
trip
mr
greenfield
this
week
only
i
start
on
my
inspection
with
burk
and
holmes
in
the
morning
i
asked
because
i
must
go
out
in
the
morning
for
a
few
days
and
i
suppose
you
wish
to
close
the
deal
before
you
leave
you
think
favorably
of
the
proposition
then
if
we
can
get
together
on
the
terms
worth
spoke
exactly
as
if
he
wished
hie
words
to
be
remembered
i
will
accept
it
suppose
you
put
your
proposition
in
writing
and
mail
it
to
me
in
the
city
then
when
i
get
back
we
will
be
in
shape
to
finish
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
if
everything
is
satisfactory
and
i
see
i
ca
get
home
before
you
leave
i
will
wire
you
thirty
minutes
after
jefferson
worth
had
returned
to
his
office
abe
lee
came
in
you
sent
for
me
sir
abe
employer
arose
and
closed
the
door
that
evening
about
dusk
the
surveyor
rode
out
of
kingston
on
the
road
toward
frontera
and
that
night
while
the
celebration
was
in
full
swing
and
the
new
electric
lights
were
sputtering
and
hissing
in
honor
of
jefferson
worth
a
loaded
wagon
drawn
by
four
mules
quietly
left
the
rear
of
the
worth
store
on
the
driver
seat
sat
pablo
with
little
noise
the
outfit
with
its
lone
driver
left
the
town
in
the
midst
of
its
demonstration
and
was
soon
in
the
open
country
on
the
road
leading
south
an
hour
later
they
had
passed
the
ranches
and
were
in
the
desert
just
beyond
where
a
party
of
jefferson
worth
linemen
who
were
stringing
the
telephone
wires
was
encamped
the
mexican
halted
his
team
and
the
heavy
form
of
pat
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
climbed
with
smothered
grunts
and
curses
to
his
side
another
hour
and
they
reached
the
point
where
the
new
road
crossed
the
old
san
felipe
trail
again
pablo
halted
his
team
ten
fifteen
twenty
minutes
they
waited
in
listening
silence
save
for
an
occasional
grunt
from
the
irishman
then
from
the
south
came
the
sound
of
wheels
and
horses
feet
git
under
way
pablo
mumbled
pat
ut
may
not
be

line
av
anybody

time
av
night
pablo
swung
his
team
to
the
left
and
drove
slowly
ahead
on
the
old
trail
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
they
were
overtaken
by
abe
lee
and
texas
joe
who
were
driving
a
light
spring
wagon
everything
all
right
boys
asked
the
surveyor
sharply
si
senor
and
yis
sorr
came
the
answers
good
we
hit
the
grit
good
and
hard
now
for
we
must
be
in
the
sand
hills
by
morning
hours
after
jefferson
worth
left
kingston
the
east
bound
overland
express
came
to
a
full
stop
in
the
desert
at
a
point
about
twenty
miles
west
of
rubio
city
the
trainmen
and
porters
ran
to
the
vestibules
and
throwing
open
the
doors
looked
out
three
or
four
passengers
who
had
risen
early
followed
the
crew
inquiring
anxiously
the
reason
for
the
delay
the
big
conductor
was
standing
by
the
rear
steps
of
the
pullman
and
a
medium
sized
man
swung
down
to
the
ground
by
his
side
back
from
the
track
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
the
watchers
saw
a
tiny
fire
over
which
two
roughly
dressed
figures
crouched
evidently
preparing
breakfast
while
a
team
with
a
light
spring
wagon
stood
tied
to
a
nearby
mesquite
tree
on
every
hand
the
great
desert
stretched
its
vast
dun
plain
without
a
sign
of
life
save
for
the
train
and
the
men
and
horses
by
the
lonely
fire
right
sir
asked
the
conductor
of
the
man
who
alighted
by
his
side
all
right
answered
the
other
in
a
low
tone
sir
the
conductor
lifted
his
hand
and
as
the
train
started
swung
aboard
the
watchers
saw
the
man
walk
without
a
glance
at
the
departing
train
straight
toward
the
little
group
at
the
fire
well
what
do
you
make
of
that
cried
an
excited
tourist
as
the
conductor
came
up
the
steps
into
the
vestibule
and
the
porter
slammed
down
the
platform
and
closed
the
door
and
who
is
he
where
is
he
going
what
is
he
doing
came
in
chorus
from
the
others
the
conductor
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
do
ask
me
i
had
orders
to
stop
here
to
let
him
off
that
all
i
know
jefferson
worth
greeted
abe
lee
and
texas
joe
as
coolly
as
though
it
was
his
daily
habit
to
meet
them
at
that
hour
and
place
how
is
everything
abe
not
a
hitch
so
far
answered
the
surveyor
and
tex
drawled
coffee
and
frijoles
ready
mr
worth
can
we
make
it
to
the
outfit
today
asked
worth
as
they
finished
their
rude
meal
and
prepared
to
start
easy
answered
abe
we
have
plenty
of
water
with
us
and
this
team
will
do
it
without
turning
a
hair
just
before
sundown
at
a
point
on
dry
river
they
found
pat
and
pablo
with
the
outfit
in
a
comfortable
camp
while
abe
lee
with
his
helpers
was
running
his
levels
over
the
proposed
line
of
the
canal
staked
out
by
the
company
surveyors
in
the
south
central
district
willard
holmes
was
trying
to
make
greenfield
see
the
necessity
of
spending
more
money
on
the
unsafe
structures
and
at
dry
river
heading
he
explained
argued
and
pleaded
in
vain
my
dear
boy
said
the
company
president
you
must
understand
that
we
are
not
in
this
country
for
sweet
charity
sake
burk
here
can
tell
you
that
we
have
not
yet
begun
to
get
our
investment
back
when
the
returns
justify
it
we
will
give
you
the
money
for
your
construction
work
but
we
ca
do
it
now
the
rights
of
the
men
who
are
putting
up
the
capital
for
this
project
must
be
considered
you
know
we
ca
use
a
dollar
of
the
company
money
except
when
it
is
necessary
if
i
were
to
let
you
spend
all
the
money
you
want
we
never
would
pay
a
dividend
but
uncle
jim
you
are
forcing
these
settlers
to
take
terrible
chances
blindly
have
they
not
rights
also
the
interest
of
the
company
is
mighty
small
compared
with
the
interests
of
the
men
who
are
buying
the
water
rights
and
developing
the
land
greenfield
flushed
angrily
look
here
willard
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
company
business
policy
as
the
engineer
in
charge
your
work
is
to
protect
both
the
settlers
and
us
to
the
best
of
your
ability
but
do
get
any
fool
notions
into
your
head
you
afford
to
go
the
way
of
that
dreamer
who
started
this
work
with
the
exalted
idea
of
making
it
a
benefit
to
the
whole
human
race
that
line
of
talk
is
all
right
for
the
boosters
like
horace
blanton
but
got
to
make
good
in
dollars
and
cents
or
the
whole
thing
goes
to
smash
with
the
south
central
deal
still
on
his
mind
and
the
picture
of
barbara
as
she
talked
to
him
of
his
work
the
morning
he
had
met
her
in
the
desert
in
his
heart
these
business
discussions
with
greenfield
and
burk
were
almost
unbearable
to
the
engineer
after
they
had
inspected
the
intake
the
dry
river
heading
and
the
levees
of
the
main
canal
he
pleaded
an
urgent
need
of
his
presence
at
the
office
and
left
the
party
to
reach
kingston
two
days
in
advance
of
their
return
barbara
was
on
the
porch
when
he
stopped
at
the
gate
tired
hot
and
dusty
from
his
long
trip
the
girl
dressed
in
some
cool
simple
white
stuff
and
seated
in
her
easy
wicker
chair
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
wide
porch
made
a
picture
wonderfully
attractive
to
the
man
who
had
ridden
all
day
in
the
scorching
heat
of
the
desert
sun
of
course
he
must
come
in
what
nonsense
to
talk
of
his
appearance
he
was
not
making
a
fashionable
social
call
the
weary
engineer
dropped
into
a
chair
and
gratefully
accepted
the
glass
of
cool
lemonade
she
brought
i
made
it
myself
not
five
minutes
ago
just
as
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
she
said
with
a
laugh
that
was
as
refreshing
as
the
drink
itself
ynez
is
up
town
shopping
for
supper
father
is
in
the
city
abe
has
gone
away
somewhere
even
pablo
has
vanished
and
i
have
seen
texas
joe
nor
pat
for
a
week
i
was
wishing
someone
would
happen
along
i
suppose
that
really
why
i
made
the
lemonade
holmes
set
his
glass
carefully
on
the
porch
railing
near
at
hand
wo
you
have
some
more
thank
you
no
you
are
quite
deserted
are
you
how
long
has
lee
been
gone
oh
he
went
the
evening
before
father
left
and
pablo
vanished
the
same
night
it
was
quite
tragic
and
the
next
day
i
was
in
the
office
when
a
man
from
the
line
came
in
asking
for
pat
he
seems
to
have
disappeared
the
same
way
i
think
they
might
at
least
have
left
some
word
or
said
in
her
innocent
talk
barbara
had
told
the
whole
story
it
was
easy
for
the
company
engineer
to
guess
where
the
surveyor
and
his
helpers
had
gone
and
what
they
were
doing
are
you
sure
that
your
father
is
in
the
city
he
asked
jokingly
barbara
laughed
oh
there
no
doubt
about
father
his
departure
was
regular
in
every
way
on
his
way
to
the
office
a
little
later
holmes
chuckled
to
himself
keenly
enjoying
the
situation
he
mentally
pictured
the
chagrin
of
greenfield
and
burk
when
he
should
tell
them
what
he
had
learned
but
would
he
tell
them
he
had
not
told
worth
what
he
knew
of
the
company
survey
in
the
south
central
district
why
should
he
tell
the
company
what
he
knew
of
worth
surveyors
once
he
would
have
considered
that
loyalty
to
his
employers
demanded
that
he
tell
what
he
had
learned
but
now
since
he
had
been
assured
so
very
emphatically
and
very
recently
that
the
policy
of
the
company
was
none
of
his
business
let
the
shrewd
manager
and
the
president
find
out
for
themselves
anyway
he
told
himself
it
could
make
no
difference
for
he
knew
what
the
result
of
abe
surveys
would
be
and
he
was
glad
indeed
that
barbara
father
had
not
walked
into
the
trap
set
for
him
the
engineer
had
concerned
himself
not
a
little
about
the
probable
view
barbara
would
take
of
his
attitude
in
permitting
her
father
to
purchase
water
rights
that
he
knew
to
be
worthless
but
now
worth
himself
would
discover
the
trick
of
the
company
men
and
it
would
not
matter
to
his
surprise
and
chagrin
jefferson
worth
walked
into
the
company
office
a
few
days
later
and
in
his
exact
colorless
voice
said
i
will
accept
your
proposition
greenfield
if
you
wish
we
can
fix
up
the
contract
and
close
the
deal
chapter
xviii
the
game
progresses
the
purchase
of
the
south
central
district
water
rights
by
jefferson
worth
was
immediately
announced
by
the
king
basin
messenger
in
a
lengthy
article
which
began
with
the
modest
statement
that
this
was
the
largest
and
most
important
business
transaction
that
had
yet
occurred
in
the
new
country
the
article
declared
that
the
name
of
jefferson
worth
was
a
guarantee
that
the
new
district
would
be
made
the
richest
and
most
prosperous
section
of
the
basin
and
that
splendid
as
the
undertaking
was
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
far
greater
things
to
be
wrought
by
the
wizard
of
the
desert
whose
genius
had
made
him
the
greatest
factor
in
the
reclamation
and
development
of
the
king
basin
country
the
work
would
be
begun
at
once
as
soon
as
men
and
teams
could
be
secured
the
thoughtful
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
read
the
article
with
a
grin
shifted
his
cigar
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
sent
a
marked
copy
of
the
paper
to
the
company
president
james
greenfield
read
the
article
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
good
business
man
who
sees
his
competitor
heavily
with
a
line
of
goods
for
which
there
is
no
market
the
pioneers
in
the
desert
who
were
not
already
located
and
the
newly
arriving
prospectors
read
and
called
upon
worth
for
further
information
the
article
reprinted
in
the
rubio
city
papers
was
read
by
many
who
familiar
with
jefferson
worth
business
record
took
the
san
felipe
trail
for
the
new
district
the
main
supply
camp
for
the
new
work
was
established
at
dry
river
crossing
the
location
being
ideal
with
an
abundant
supply
of
running
water
from
the
waste
gate
at
the
heading
coming
down
the
old
channel
where
barbara
mother
had
perished
of
thirst
beside
a
dry
water
hole
from
the
camp
the
san
felipe
trail
led
in
one
direction
straight
to
rubio
city
and
in
the
other
to
the
main
road
in
the
heart
of
the
basin
half
way
between
kingston
and
frontera
at
this
camp
jefferson
worth
made
his
headquarters
not
a
man
whether
he
presented
himself
or
with
team
and
tools
but
was
forced
to
talk
with
worth
in
his
tent
office
before
he
was
set
to
work
under
abe
lee
and
his
three
lieutenants
texas
pat
and
pablo
it
was
in
those
days
that
willard
holmes
reported
to
the
manager
that
many
of
his
men
were
leaving
the
company
and
were
going
to
work
for
jefferson
worth
the
news
did
not
appear
to
alarm
burk
with
a
grin
he
advised
the
engineer
do
worry
old
man
they
be
damned
glad
to
come
back
to
us
before
many
weeks
i
was
looking
out
a
route
for
the
new
central
main
yesterday
said
holmes
and
rode
over
to
camp
at
the
crossing
judging
from
the
size
and
activity
of
the
camp
he
is
planning
to
go
in
good
and
strong
he
must
have
a
big
force
at
work
now
and
he
is
taking
on
men
all
the
time
your
uncle
jim
will
be
delighted
to
hear
of
friend
enterprise
the
engineer
face
did
not
express
appreciation
of
the
manager
wit
have
you
heard
the
proposition
that
worth
is
making
to
every
man
on
the
job
he
asked
no
what
is
he
doing
giving
away
one
hundred
and
sixty
shares
of
stock
with
free
telephones
and
electric
lights
passes
at
the
opera
house
unlimited
credit
at
the
store
and
a
deposit
at
the
bank
as
a
bonus
to
anyone
who
will
locate
in
his
district
he
seems
to
have
all
kinds
of
money
to
throw
away
it
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
answered
the
other
with
a
smile
but
he
tells
every
man
when
he
hires
him
to
file
on
any
claim
in
the
district
that
he
wants
and
he
can
have
the
water
rights
for
it
without
any
cash
payment
and
without
any
interest
for
five
years
in
a
good
many
cases
he
is
even
advancing
money
to
pay
the
government
entry
fee
and
promising
to
carry
them
for
their
equipment
and
supplies
until
they
make
a
crop
but
he
makes
them
agree
to
stay
on
the
land
and
actually
farm
the
claims
he
wo
let
a
speculator
even
look
in
burk
expressed
his
opinion
of
jefferson
worth
ability
in
the
strongest
terms
the
man
was
insane
childish
those
fellows
would
leave
him
high
and
dry
that
what
i
said
at
first
agreed
holmes
i
asked
bill
watson
who
quit
us
with
his
team
at
number
five
to
go
to
work
in
the
south
central
if
he
actually
thought
worth
was
going
to
let
his
men
make
all
the
money
what
did
bill
say
holmes
smiled
you
know
how
bill
talks
no
he
said
put
it
to
the
old
man
just
that
way
myself
i
says
say
i
sounds
good
all
right
worth
but
it
ai
reasonable
that
you
yourself
out
of
this
deal
where
do
you
come
in
says
i
the
joker
in
this
little
game
and
worth
explained
put
in
burk
eagerly
shaken
out
of
his
usual
thoughtful
calm
by
holmes
story
bill
says
that
worth
told
him
that
he
owns
a
big
tract
of
land
where
the
camp
is
located
and
that
he
is
going
to
build
a
town
there
and
would
make
his
money
by
the
increased
value
of
his
property
that
would
result
from
the
development
of
the
district
by
business
enterprises
that
would
depend
on
the
prosperity
of
the
ranchers
and
by
the
large
increase
in
the
value
of
water
rights
that
he
would
sell
later
to
those
who
came
in
to
invest
after
the
district
was
developed
i
suggested
to
bill
that
he
could
see
how
worth
was
simply
using
him
to
gain
his
own
ends
and
did
bill
see
the
point
he
said
damned
right
he
is
and
so
am
i
usin
jefferson
worth
to
gain
my
ends
ai
i
i
might
work
for
the
company
a
hundred
years
and
never
get
a
cent
more
than
the
wages
that
you
payin
now
jefferson
worth
he
pays
me
the
same
wages
and
gives
me
a
chance
to
get
my
share
of
all
that
comes
out
of
what
i
do
i
do
care
a
damn
if
he
makes
ten
millions
out
of
the
country
i
hope
he
will
because
he
is
giving
us
poor
devils
who
ai
got
nothin
now
a
chance
to
get
a
ranch
an
do
somethin
for
ourselves
of
course
he
uses
us
to
make
money
for
himself
so
does
the
company
use
us
do
they
the
difference
is
that
jefferson
worth
lets
us
use
and
the
company
just
counts
us
in
with
the
rest
of
the
live
stock
how
did
you
get
around
that
asked
burk
studying
his
face
i
did
get
around
it
answered
the
engineer
dryly
burk
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
spoke
with
unusual
earnestness
bill
is
right
holmes
we
consider
the
men
who
work
for
us
as
we
consider
horses
and
mules
we
feed
the
stock
we
pay
wages
to
the
men
when
an
animal
is
worn
out
and
useless
we
kill
him
and
get
another
when
a
man
is
down
and
out
we
fire
him
and
hire
another
and
you
and
i
are
no
better
the
company
looks
on
us
exactly
the
same
way
we
have
no
more
real
interest
in
this
work
than
the
skinniest
old
plug
on
the
job
and
the
company
wo
permit
us
to
have
they
think
they
could
afford
it
that
it
would
be
good
business
up
damn
you
and
here
your
corn
and
hay
that
all
we
have
to
do
with
it
if
you
balk
and
kick
out
you
go
to
rustle
your
own
feed
it
a
beautiful
system
for
the
company
i
almost
wish
that
worth
had
a
chance
to
try
out
his
scheme
it
would
at
least
be
an
interesting
experiment
to
watch
well
why
has
he
a
chance
to
try
it
out
you
know
very
well
why
because
the
deal
that
your
talented
uncle
fixed
up
for
our
friend
jeff
was
loaded
for
the
express
purpose
of
blowing
that
philanthropic
promoter
into
financial
you
report
that
the
development
of
that
south
central
district
was
practically
impossible
because
of
the
elevations
yes
well
ordinarily
the
project
would
have
been
abandoned
then
and
there
but
i
suggested
to
greenfield
that
we
go
ahead
as
if
everything
was
all
right
and
then
unload
it
on
worth
so
that
he
would
smash
himself
as
he
is
doing
you
should
be
proud
of
your
scheme
i
am
proud
of
the
scheme
but
i
not
proud
of
myself
i
being
a
good
mule
that
all
jefferson
worth
took
our
apparent
purpose
to
go
ahead
with
the
work
as
evidence
that
the
proposition
was
all
right
and
that
why
jefferson
worth
will
not
finish
his
intended
experiment
yes
but
the
fact
is
he
did
not
accept
the
proposition
without
investigation
what
the
engineer
told
the
manager
what
he
had
learned
from
barbara
burk
whistled
softly
then
you
think
the
old
fox
sent
abe
lee
out
to
check
our
survey
and
framed
up
his
trip
to
the
city
to
gain
time
well
be
but
look
here
holmes
worth
did
accept
our
proposition
until
after
he
had
investigated
no
well
who
makes
the
mistake
then
your
man
black
or
abe
lee
that
exactly
what
i
like
to
know
said
the
company
chief
engineer
grimly
the
manager
grinned
as
he
saw
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
then
thoughtfully
he
selected
a
cigar
pretty
game
is
it
old
man
he
said
and
offered
the
box
to
holmes
who
declined
when
the
weed
was
going
well
the
manager
head
tipped
toward
his
left
shoulder
and
his
cigar
was
in
the
opposite
corner
of
his
mouth
and
you
knew
what
worth
was
up
to
before
the
deal
was
closed
why
you
report
it
holmes
the
engineer
frowned
i
did
tell
worth
what
black
survey
showed
and
you
must
remember
that
uncle
jim
rubbed
it
into
me
good
and
hard
on
the
question
of
the
construction
work
that
the
policy
of
the
company
was
none
of
my
business
this
deal
was
not
in
my
department
dear
me
murmured
the
manager
with
another
grin
what
a
company
mule
it
is
and
you
were
so
dead
sure
of
your
man
black
which
would
you
rather
my
boy
have
black
right
and
abe
wrong
the
company
to
win
or
have
black
wrong
and
abe
right
and
jefferson
worth
free
to
go
on
with
his
little
experiment
speak
for
yourself
growled
holmes
i
will
returned
burk
i
have
been
a
good
mule
so
my
conscience
is
clear
if
i
knew
how
and
thought
it
would
do
any
good
i
would
pray
that
abe
lee
made
no
mistake
well
i
wo
believe
that
it
black
mistake
he
comes
from
too
good
a
school
holmes
replied
stubbornly
and
your
confidence
in
your
man
is
no
doubt
equaled
by
confidence
in
his
interesting
is
it
you
go
to
thunder
growled
the
engineer
unable
to
stand
more
the
manager
mocking
laugh
followed
him
out
of
the
room
as
the
engineer
passed
the
open
window
of
the
office
a
moment
later
burk
called
to
him
softly
oh
holmes
i
have
an
idea
that
may
be
helpful
to
you
in
the
matter
against
his
will
the
engineer
paused
and
drew
close
to
the
window
well
why
do
you
call
on
miss
worth
perhaps
but
willard
holmes
fled
and
yet
that
which
burk
suggested
in
jest
was
exactly
what
willard
holmes
had
already
determined
in
his
own
mind
to
do
the
engineer
had
not
seen
barbara
since
the
conclusion
of
the
south
central
deal
and
he
was
continually
asking
himself
how
the
girl
would
look
upon
his
part
in
that
transaction
or
rather
his
failure
to
take
a
part
in
it
barbara
frank
confession
when
she
had
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
blaming
him
because
of
the
seer
dismissal
that
they
might
start
square
had
put
their
friendship
upon
such
a
ground
that
the
man
felt
guilty
in
not
confessing
at
once
to
her
how
he
had
aided
greenfield
and
burk
in
their
effort
to
trap
her
father
he
could
not
shake
off
the
conviction
that
she
would
undoubtedly
look
upon
his
attitude
as
being
what
she
had
called
untrue
to
the
work
the
one
thing
she
had
declared
she
could
not
forgive
would
she
forgive
him
she
had
been
so
interested
in
his
work
and
the
engineer
was
beginning
to
realize
how
very
much
this
meant
to
him
at
the
worth
home
the
engineer
learned
from
the
indian
woman
that
barbara
had
left
kingston
that
morning
to
visit
her
father
in
his
camp
in
the
south
central
district
she
had
gone
with
texas
joe
in
the
buckboard
and
they
had
taken
her
saddle
horse
el
capitan
when
would
la
senorita
return
ynez
did
not
know
chapter
xix
gathered
at
barbara
court
barbara
trip
to
the
south
central
district
was
full
of
interest
riding
with
texas
joe
in
a
light
buckboard
drawn
by
a
span
of
lively
broncos
with
el
capitan
leading
behind
she
was
as
merry
as
a
out
for
a
holiday
the
old
plainsman
whose
iron
will
and
marvelous
endurance
had
brought
his
companions
and
the
baby
safely
out
of
that
land
of
death
years
before
turned
often
to
look
at
her
now
while
his
keen
eyes
dark
still
under
their
grizzly
brows
were
soft
with
fond
regard
and
his
voice
gentle
and
drawling
as
ever
was
filled
with
tender
affection
under
his
drooping
gray
mustache
black
once
his
slow
smile
came
in
the
ready
answer
of
full
sympathy
with
her
mood
eager
as
ever
to
know
all
about
the
work
of
reclaiming
her
desert
the
young
woman
plied
him
with
questions
and
texas
exerted
himself
to
recall
scenes
and
incidents
of
which
he
had
not
told
her
before
he
reviewed
the
work
from
that
first
survey
to
the
present
with
vivid
pictures
of
life
in
the
camps
in
the
towns
or
on
the
trail
with
construction
gangs
and
grading
crews
or
freighters
outfits
and
the
glimpses
of
toil
and
hardship
discomforts
and
suffering
lost
none
of
their
reality
in
the
dry
humor
of
his
words
texas
joe
was
of
that
sort
who
habitually
laugh
at
hardships
who
indeed
could
not
otherwise
live
in
the
wild
lands
they
helped
to
tame
nor
did
the
shrewd
old
frontiersman
fail
to
observe
how
most
of
barbara
questions
required
in
their
answers
something
touching
willard
holmes
or
how
the
incidents
that
pleased
her
most
were
those
in
which
the
engineer
figured
on
her
part
the
young
woman
was
secretly
delighted
to
see
how
loyally
her
companion
spoke
in
admiring
praise
of
the
surveyor
abe
lee
whenever
the
name
of
holmes
was
mentioned
abe
was
somehow
brought
into
the
story
holmes
is
really
a
fine
engineer
do
you
think
asked
barbara
mischievously
at
the
conclusion
of
a
story
in
which
both
holmes
and
abe
figured
sure
he
is
i
do
reckon
them
eastern
schools
ever
turned
out
a
better
and
what
counts
more
sometimes
he
all
man
he
is
but
you
see
honey
he
belongs
to
the
company
abe
now
wal
you
see
abe
he
sabeys
the
country
like
a
burro
does
the
cook
shack
and
he
just
as
good
a
man
as
the
easterner
though
not
so
pretty
to
look
at
and
you
can
bet
there
do
no
company
get
a
hobble
on
abe
do
the
men
who
work
for
the
company
like
mr
holmes
sure
they
do
all
the
men
like
holmes
fine
but
they
just
naturally
love
abe
but
when
they
had
turned
into
the
san
felipe
trail
and
were
traveling
eastward
barbara
ceased
to
question
texas
about
the
reclamation
work
and
led
him
to
tell
her
again
the
familiar
story
of
his
journey
from
san
felipe
with
worth
the
seer
pat
and
the
boy
abe
in
the
days
when
that
old
road
was
the
only
mark
of
man
in
all
those
miles
of
desolate
waste
reaching
a
point
where
the
sand
hills
could
be
distinguished
he
pointed
them
out
to
her
and
the
young
woman
at
sight
of
the
huge
rolling
drifts
that
shone
all
golden
in
the
desert
sun
grasped
his
arm
with
a
low
exclamation
in
silence
as
they
drew
nearer
they
watched
the
low
yellow
hills
lift
their
naked
bulk
up
from
the
gray
and
green
patches
of
and
greasewood
that
so
thinly
carpeted
the
plain
when
even
the
desert
vegetation
could
find
no
life
in
the
ever
shifting
sands
and
the
first
of
the
great
drifts
loomed
huge
and
forbidding
against
the
sky
seeming
to
bar
their
way
barbara
spoke
again
now
tell
me
uncle
tex
tell
me
as
we
go
just
how
it
was
and
show
me
the
places
the
plainsman
did
not
answer
and
she
urged
again
please
uncle
tex
tell
me
i
want
to
see
it
all
just
as
it
happened
i
feel
that
i
must
do
you
understand
so
the
old
plainsman
told
her
and
pointed
out
the
places
as
nearly
as
he
could
explaining
how
the
drifts
moved
always
eastward
under
the
winds
how
at
times
most
frequently
in
the
spring
months
when
the
fierce
gales
swept
down
through
the
pass
and
across
the
basin
the
huge
billows
of
sand
would
roll
forward
so
swiftly
that
tents
or
wagons
in
their
path
would
be
buried
in
a
few
hours
and
how
in
the
calm
seasons
with
every
light
breeze
they
work
their
silent
way
inch
by
inch
even
as
he
spoke
barbara
looking
saw
a
thin
film
of
sand
fine
as
powdered
snow
curl
like
mist
over
the
edge
of
a
drift
as
a
breath
of
air
swept
lightly
up
the
western
slope
and
over
the
summit
of
the
hill
at
the
point
where
worth
party
had
camped
to
await
the
passing
of
the
storm
texas
stopped
the
team
and
showed
her
how
they
had
rigged
their
rude
canvas
shelter
on
one
side
of
the
wagon
to
protect
themselves
from
the
cutting
blast
farther
on
he
pointed
out
the
spot
where
they
had
found
the
horse
with
the
broken
halter
strap
and
then
they
came
to
the
great
drift
where
her
people
had
made
their
last
camp
and
where
later
jefferson
worth
had
spent
that
night
alone
with
the
spirit
that
lives
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
again
texas
halted
his
team
and
barbara
leaving
her
companion
in
the
buckboard
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
hill
that
held
buried
deep
in
its
heart
what
was
the
body
of
her
true
father
buried
there
were
there
brothers
sisters
lying
under
that
huge
mound
could
the
sands
if
they
could
speak
tell
her
who
she
was
her
name
and
people
could
they
if
they
would
make
known
to
her
relatives
and
friends
of
her
own
blood
coming
slowly
down
the
shoulder
of
the
drift
she
went
around
to
the
foot
of
the
steep
eastern
side
and
there
in
the
lee
of
the
billow
that
curled
high
above
her
she
tried
to
dig
with
her
hands
a
tiny
hole
at
every
movement
that
displaced
a
handful
of
sand
a
dry
golden
flood
poured
down
from
above
covering
instantly
the
mark
she
had
made
with
sudden
energy
the
young
woman
exerted
all
her
strength
digging
faster
and
faster
but
still
from
above
her
head
down
the
steep
side
of
the
drift
the
sand
slid
without
effort
making
a
faint
whispering
sound
as
if
to
mock
her
labors
then
texas
called
and
she
went
back
to
him
her
brown
eyes
hard
and
dry
the
old
plainsman
quick
to
feel
her
mood
would
have
driven
swiftly
on
past
the
remaining
scenes
of
the
tragedy
and
tried
to
talk
of
other
things
but
she
would
not
have
it
so
she
must
know
all
so
he
showed
her
where
he
had
first
found
the
tracks
in
the
sand
and
then
where
the
baby
feet
had
left
their
marks
when
the
tired
mother
had
set
her
down
to
rest
thus
they
came
at
last
when
the
day
was
almost
gone
to
the
grave
beside
the
trail
the
trail
that
had
beside
its
many
miles
so
many
graves
and
barbara
stood
before
the
simple
headstone
that
bore
only
the
date
and
one
word
mother
and
the
silent
man
who
had
in
his
wild
adventurous
life
witnessed
so
many
scenes
of
death
turned
away
his
face
that
he
might
not
see
the
girl
kneeling
beside
the
mound
of
earth
when
barbara
coming
back
to
the
buckboard
saw
him
so
she
understood
and
when
texas
hearing
her
light
steps
turned
quickly
toward
her
he
saw
the
brown
eyes
filled
now
with
softening
tears
while
her
face
expressed
the
gratitude
she
could
not
put
into
words
behind
them
the
upper
rim
of
the
sun
shone
above
the
top
of
the
purple
mountain
wall
over
their
heads
in
the
soft
still
depths
of
the
velvet
sky
an
early
star
appeared
around
them
on
every
side
the
great
desert
lay
under
its
seas
of
soft
color
its
veils
of
misty
light
and
streaming
scarfs
of
lilac
and
rose
even
as
they
looked
the
dusk
of
twilight
fell
upon
the
great
plain
the
weird
call
came
from
a
hummock
near
the
trail
the
ghostly
form
of
a
coyote
slipped
stealthily
past
like
a
shadow
moving
from
shadow
to
shadow
until
he
was
lost
in
the
deeper
shade
out
of
which
as
if
in
mocking
challenge
of
a
spirit
band
to
any
mortal
who
would
follow
came
the
wild
snarling
unearthly
cries
of
his
invisible
mates
and
still
to
the
eastward
the
higher
levels
of
the
mesa
above
the
rim
of
the
dark
basin
the
slow
drifting
clouds
of
dust
that
lifted
from
the
tired
feet
of
the
grading
teams
coming
into
the
camp
from
the
day
work
on
the
canals
or
from
freighters
drawing
near
their
journey
end
caught
the
last
of
the
light
and
showed
long
level
bands
and
bars
and
threads
of
gold
against
the
deep
purple
of
the
hills
beyond
whose
peaks
and
domes
and
ridges
were
flaming
crimson
burnished
copper
and
gleaming
silver
on
the
deep
background
of
the
sky
before
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
deep
dry
river
channel
through
which
now
a
generous
stream
of
water
flowed
they
could
see
the
tents
of
the
camp
some
glowing
brightly
from
lights
within
others
showing
mere
spots
of
dull
white
in
the
gloom
while
here
and
there
lanterns
like
great
fireflies
flitted
aimlessly
to
and
fro
before
two
tent
houses
some
distance
apart
from
the
main
camp
and
built
under
a
wide
ramada
made
of
willow
poles
and
arrow
weed
brought
from
the
distant
river
texas
stopped
his
team
from
the
open
door
of
one
of
the
tents
jefferson
worth
came
quickly
at
the
sound
of
their
arrival
to
receive
his
daughter
and
from
her
father
arms
barbara
turned
to
greet
abe
lee
who
following
his
chief
from
the
canvas
house
had
paused
a
little
back
from
the
group
in
the
shadow
of
the
ramada
later
in
the
evening
when
barbara
had
had
her
supper
with
her
father
and
abe
in
the
big
camp
dining
tent
and
the
three
were
sitting
in
the
dark
under
the
wide
brush
porch
pat
came
with
texas
as
the
big
irishman
said
to
see
how
the
new
boss
liked
her
quarters
and
then
pablo
came
softly
out
of
the
darkness
with
his
guitar
to
bid
la
senorita
welcome
and
to
ask
if
she
would
care
that
night
to
listen
a
little
to
the
music
that
he
knew
she
loved
so
barbara
held
her
little
court
before
the
rude
tent
house
under
the
arrow
weed
ramada
in
the
heart
of
her
desert
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
spot
where
they
had
gathered
once
before
around
a
baby
girl
whose
mother
lay
dead
beside
a
dry
water
hole
and
not
one
of
them
thought
of
the
significance
of
the
group
or
how
each
representing
a
distinct
type
stood
for
a
vital
element
in
the
combination
of
human
forces
that
was
working
out
for
the
race
the
reclamation
of
the
land
the
tall
lean
surveyor
trained
in
no
school
but
the
school
of
his
work
itself
with
the
dreams
of
the
seer
ruling
him
in
his
every
professional
service
the
aggressive
irishman
born
and
trained
to
handle
that
class
of
men
that
will
recognize
in
their
labor
no
governing
force
higher
than
the
physical
the
frontiersman
whom
the
forces
of
nature
through
the
hard
years
had
fashioned
for
his
peculiar
place
in
this
movement
of
the
race
as
truly
as
wave
and
river
and
wind
and
sun
had
made
the
king
basin
desert
itself
the
financier
who
behind
his
gray
mask
wrought
with
the
mighty
force
of
his
age
capital
and
a
little
to
one
side
sitting
on
the
ground
reclining
against
one
of
the
willow
posts
that
upheld
the

shelter
dark
pablo
softly
touching
his
guitar
representing
a
people
still
far
down
on
the
ladder
of
the
world
upward
climb
but
still
sharing
as
all
peoples
would
share
the
work
of
all
and
in
the
midst
of
the
group
the
center
of
her
court
barbara
true
representative
of
a
true
womanhood
that
holds
in
itself
the
future
of
the
race
even
as
the
desert
held
in
its
earth
womb
life
for
the
strong
ones
whom
the
slow
years
had
fitted
to
realize
it
faith
said
pat
when
pablo
guitar
was
silent
for
a
little
av
only
the
seer
was
here
the
family
wud
be
altogether
complete
dear
old
seer
said
barbara
softly
how
he
would
love
to
be
here
and
how
we
would
love
to
have
him
but
under
cover
of
the
darkness
a
warm
blush
colored
the
young
cheeks
for
when
pat
spoke
she
had
not
been
thinking
of
the
absence
of
her
old
friend
but
wishing
for
the
presence
of
another
engineer
who
also
was
working
for
the
reclamation
of
her
desert
and
who
was
himself
in
turn
being
wrought
upon
by
his
work
learning
as
the
girl
had
hoped
he
would
learn
the
language
of
the
land
jefferson
worth
spoke
in
his
exact
way
even
if
he
is
not
here
this
is
all
the
seer
work
and
just
then
from
a
distance
up
the
old
wash
came
the
weird
unnatural
cry
of
a
coyote
it
was
as
though
the
spirit
of
the
desert
spoke
in
answer
to
the
banker
words
yell
ye
sneaking
thievin
imp
yer
time
in
this
counthry
is
about
up
exclaimed
the
irishman
with
a
growl
of
deep
satisfaction
and
again
out
of
the
shadow
the
soft
plaintively
sweet
music
of
guitar
floated
away
on
the
still
darkness
of
the
night
chapter
xx
what
the
stakes
revealed
james
greenfield
returning
to
kingston
from
his
tour
of
inspection
left
at
once
for
his
own
world
a
world
of
offices
with
mahogany
furniture
of
men
with
white
collars
and
pale
faces
of
banks
and
trust
companies
and
good
business
the
afternoon
of
the
day
he
left
willard
holmes
rode
into
the
camp
at
dry
river
crossing
the
engineer
explained
that
he
was
looking
over
the
route
of
a
new
main
canal
that
was
being
surveyed
by
his
men
and
that
finding
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
worth
headquarters
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
call
from
barbara
as
well
as
from
jefferson
worth
and
abe
lee
the
company
man
received
a
hearty
welcome
with
a
cordial
invitation
to
ride
with
them
the
next
day
over
the
line
of
their
work
although
holmes
watched
with
peculiar
sensitiveness
there
was
no
sign
from
either
of
the
three
that
they
had
yet
discovered
the
real
significance
of
the
south
central
deal
or
that
they
knew
the
part
he
had
played
in
it
his
desire
to
end
the
whole
unpleasant
situation
by
going
over
the
work
with
worth
and
the
surveyor
and
by
confessing
to
barbara
how
he
had
permitted
her
father
to
walk
into
the
trap
led
him
to
accept
the
invitation
the
little
party
left
camp
early
the
next
morning
and
following
the
line
of
black
survey
found
a
mile
or
more
of
the
canal
already
completed
while
a
large
force
of
men
and
teams
was
at
work
clearing
the
ground
and
pushing
the
big
ditch
still
farther
in
a
general
southerly
direction
toward
the
company
canal
fifteen
miles
away
abe
lee
explained
to
barbara
that
other
camps
were
located
at
points
farther
on
thus
dividing
the
whole
district
to
be
excavated
into
several
sections
you
see
he
said
turning
to
holmes
the
waste
from
dry
river
heading
coming
down
the
old
channel
gives
us
water
at
several
points
so
that
we
can
handle
this
work
to
a
little
better
advantage
than
we
used
to
do
with
the
first
of
the
company
canals
i
see
said
the
company
man
and
how
many
head
of
stock
are
you
working
about
fifteen
hundred
now
but
we
are
increasing
the
force
right
along
we
expect
to
handle
about
twice
that
instantly
willard
holmes
saw
that
he
could
still
save
jefferson
worth
from
heavy
financial
loss
but
it
was
to
the
interest
of
the
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
for
jefferson
worth
to
lose
heavily
what
should
he
do
they
had
left
the
first
section
of
the
work
now
and
were
following
the
line
of
the
survey
where
the
brush
had
been
roughly
cleared
the
engineer
preoccupied
in
his
struggle
with
the
question
that
confronted
him
had
dropped
behind
the
others
when
suddenly
barbara
looking
back
checked
el
capitan
what
the
matter
mr
holmes
she
called
the
others
also
looked
back
to
see
the
engineer
kneeling
on
the
ground
jefferson
worth
glanced
quickly
at
his
superintendent
who
chuckled
outright
what
is
it
cried
barbara
at
abe
unusual
laugh
what
the
joke
before
either
of
the
men
could
answer
holmes
sprang
to
his
saddle
and
with
a
quick
jab
of
his
spurs
in
the
horse
flanks
rejoined
them
on
the
run
in
his
excitement
the
mental
habits
of
his
life
asserted
themselves
and
he
was
again
the
typical
corporation
official
dealing
with
a
mere
private
individual
operating
on
a
small
scale
look
here
he
burst
forth
sharply
to
abe
these
are
not
our
company
stakes
you
are
not
following
black
line
the
surveyor
grinned
we
followed
it
for
a
half
mile
this
side
of
the
cut
then
we
branched
off
you
evidently
did
not
notice
where
do
you
strike
it
again
we
do
strike
it
again
then
how
do
you
get
to
the
intake
location
we
do
get
to
the
intake
located
at
all
we
strike
your
canal
three
miles
farther
up
the
company
chief
engineer
retorted
hotly
but
you
ca
do
that
our
survey
shows
he
stopped
your
survey
shows
what
came
abe
lee
sharp
challenge
you
are
undoubtedly
familiar
with
the
data
turned
in
by
your
man
black
for
you
told
worth
the
quality
of
the
soil
before
he
closed
the
deal
what
else
does
your
survey
show
before
the
engineer
could
answer
jefferson
worth
cool
voice
broke
in
you
understand
holmes
that
there
is
nothing
in
my
contract
with
your
company
that
binds
me
to
follow
the
line
of
your
survey
or
accept
your
location
of
the
intake
the
company
contracts
to
deliver
the
water
into
my
canal
that
is
all
the
engineer
regained
control
of
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
worth
and
yours
lee
i
forgot
myself
i
see
that
my
man
black
made
a
mistake
abe
laughed
dryly
in
checking
over
black
work
holmes
i
found
his
elevations
correct
at
every
point
holmes
himself
smiled
as
he
said
well
lee
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
i
am
very
glad
you
checked
over
black
work
and
worth
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
you
success
in
your
project
thank
you
said
worth
i
am
already
indebted
to
you
for
a
valuable
piece
of
information
indebted
to
me
you
remember
what
i
asked
you
when
i
was
going
over
this
proposition
with
greenfield
and
burk
in
the
company
office
i
remember
that
you
asked
me
about
the
soil
in
the
district
you
answered
that
the
was
all
right
holmes
drew
a
long
breath
and
you
let
uncle
jim
and
burk
think
i
let
them
think
what
they
wanted
to
think
said
jefferson
worth
barbara
who
had
listened
with
intense
interest
to
the
conversation
at
holmes
unfinished
remark
and
her
father
reply
moved
el
capitan
slowly
away
from
his
place
beside
worth
horse
and
went
close
to
abe
lee
all
the
gladness
was
gone
from
the
young
woman
face
now
and
while
she
maintained
a
show
of
interest
it
was
plainly
forced
the
banker
at
his
daughter
movement
retreated
behind
his
gray
mask
and
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
spoke
only
when
it
was
necessary
leaving
her
entirely
to
the
surveyor
and
willard
holmes
barbara
had
understood
from
the
talk
of
the
men
that
her
father
by
using
the
unsuspecting
engineer
had
in
some
way
shrewdly
gained
a
business
advantage
over
the
company
the
incident
forced
her
as
she
thought
to
see
with
a
cruel
clearness
that
to
jefferson
worth
this
splendid
work
of
reclaiming
the
desert
was
nothing
but
the
opportunity
to
win
larger
financial
gains
that
he
was
still
practicing
the
tactics
for
which
he
was
famous
she
shrank
from
him
unconsciously
but
to
the
man
as
plainly
as
she
had
drawn
back
in
fear
that
night
years
before
as
the
baby
had
turned
from
him
to
the
seer
then
the
young
woman
turned
from
him
to
abe
lee
now
during
the
rest
of
the
day
barbara
kept
so
close
to
the
surveyor
side
that
willard
holmes
had
no
opportunity
to
talk
with
her
alone
and
when
they
arrived
again
at
the
headquarters
camp
the
engineer
promising
to
call
upon
her
soon
in
kingston
left
for
one
of
his
own
camps
a
few
miles
away
that
evening
jefferson
worth
and
his
daughter
sat
alone
under
the
arrow
weed
ramada
facing
the
river
moving
her
camp
chair
closer
in
the
dusk
so
close
that
reaching
out
she
laid
her
warm
young
hand
on
the
hand
of
her
father
barbara
said
in
a
low
tone
daddy
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
about
this
south
central
district
business
she
felt
the
slim
nervous
fingers
move
uneasily
never
before
had
barbara
asked
him
to
explain
any
of
his
transactions
the
man
habit
of
retiring
behind
that
gray
mask
whenever
the
subject
of
his
business
was
mentioned
together
with
the
girl
instinctive
shrinking
lest
his
answers
to
such
a
question
should
drive
them
farther
apart
prevented
but
perhaps
because
willard
holmes
was
concerned
perhaps
because
of
her
peculiar
interest
in
the
work
involved
barbara
forced
herself
to
ask
what
do
you
want
to
know
at
his
expressionless
tone
it
was
to
barbara
as
though
she
felt
the
chill
of
his
cold
mask
coming
between
them
but
she
persisted
and
in
her
voice
was
passionate
earnestness
i
want
to
know
all
about
it
father
i
must
why
because
she
hesitated
because
i
understood
from
the
conversation
about
the
surveys
that
someone
had
made
a
mistake
i
i
want
to
make
a
mistake
daddy
wo
you
please
explain
it
all
to
me
what
was
it
that
you
let
greenfield
and
burk
think
perhaps
because
of
the
memories
of
the
place
or
because
it
was
the
first
time
barbara
had
ever
sought
an
explanation
or
again
perhaps
it
was
because
willard
holmes
was
interested
jefferson
worth
answered
i
let
them
think
i
was
a
fool
but
why
was
holmes
so
excited
when
he
found
out
about
those
stakes
he
discovered
that
i
was
not
such
a
fool
as
they
thought
then
jefferson
worth
explained
to
the
girl
the
whole
situation
he
made
clear
greenfield
reason
for
offering
him
the
water
rights
why
he
would
have
taken
the
stock
without
investigation
but
for
the
hint
he
received
from
the
company
engineer
manner
and
the
way
holmes
had
answered
that
simple
question
about
the
soil
how
he
had
made
the
survey
secretly
because
greenfield
would
have
refused
to
close
the
deal
if
he
had
known
that
worth
wanted
it
after
he
had
it
investigated
and
because
if
greenfield
believed
the
district
stock
to
be
valueless
he
would
sell
at
a
very
low
figure
rather
than
not
sell
at
all
and
how
it
was
that
same
low
figure
that
enabled
him
to
give
the
men
who
were
working
on
the
canal
a
chance
to
acquire
farms
of
their
own
when
he
had
made
it
all
plain
the
young
woman
exclaimed
and
this
man
greenfield
and
those
with
him
in
the
company
are
the
men
who
are
doing
the
seer
work
who
are
making
the
reclamation
of
the
desert
possible
i
do
i
ca
understand
it
it
is
a
very
simple
business
deal
said
worth
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
it
greenfield
and
his
men
are
good
men
they
are
simply
defending
their
interests
from
a
competitor
this
desert
never
could
be
reclaimed
at
all
without
them
or
others
like
them
tell
me
again
daddy
was
holmes
that
this
land
was
worthless
certainly
he
was
sure
of
it
he
had
all
of
black
data
giving
the
elevations
and
he
knew
that
they
were
trying
to
sell
it
to
you
yes
but
did
he
know
did
he
know
it
was
a
trap
to
ruin
your
work
certainly
he
must
have
known
the
girl
voice
trembled
oh
why
why
did
he
tell
you
why
he
warn
you
he
did
yes
daddy
but
he
did
not
to
do
it
for
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
until
you
explained
and
i
thought
her
voice
ended
in
a
sob
but
barbara
holmes
did
just
what
he
should
have
done
he
is
in
the
employ
of
the
company
he
had
no
right
to
interfere
with
their
business
every
man
has
a
right
to
be
a
man
she
answered
hotly
abe
have
kept
still
the
seer
would
not
have
helped
them
in
their
schemes
i
do
wonder
that
the
company
discharged
the
seer
to
give
holmes
his
place
jefferson
worth
was
silent
for
a
little
then
he
said
if
i
had
thought
that
you
would
blame
holmes
i
never
would
have
told
you
but
you
did
right
to
tell
me
i
am
glad
for
i
see
now
that
i
making
a
mistake
that
i
was
making
two
mistakes
i
misjudged
you
daddy
forgive
me
and
i
i
have
been
mistaken
about
mr
holmes
for
an
hour
or
more
the
two
sat
silent
the
mind
of
each
occupied
with
thoughts
that
were
much
the
same
barbara
for
the
first
time
felt
that
she
could
enter
fully
into
her
father
life
she
had
at
last
seen
behind
his
gray
mask
and
found
herself
in
full
sympathy
with
him
and
the
lonely
man
knew
that
at
last
he
had
gained
that
for
which
his
heart
hungered
the
fullest
companionship
of
the
girl
he
loved
as
his
only
child
at
last
barbara
said
softly
daddy
i
am
not
going
back
to
kingston
i
am
going
to
stay
here
with
you
you
can
have
another
tent
house
built
and
texas
can
go
for
ynez
who
will
bring
what
things
i
need
i
am
going
to
make
a
home
for
you
you
need
me
daddy
you
are
so
alone
in
your
work
no
one
understands
you
as
i
do
now
let
me
come
and
help
you
awkwardly
jefferson
worth
put
out
his
hand
and
drawing
his
daughter
closer
said
in
a
tone
that
barbara
had
never
heard
before
i
was
wishing
that
you
would
want
to
stay
you
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
now
barbara
why
no
of
course
not
what
a
strange
thing
to
ask
i
have
never
been
afraid
of
you
why
should
i
be
and
barbara
thought
that
she
spoke
truly
that
she
had
never
feared
him
though
jefferson
worth
knew
better
so
another
tent
house
was
built
and
texas
went
alone
to
kingston
to
return
with
ynez
as
barbara
had
planned
and
the
young
woman
set
about
making
a
home
for
her
father
in
the
rude
desert
camp
every
day
nearly
she
rode
el
capitan
out
to
some
part
of
the
work
and
the
men
who
were
toiling
for
more
than
wages
learned
to
know
her
and
to
hail
her
presence
as
a
good
omen
many
a
rough
fellow
dreaming
of
wife
or
sweetheart
and
the
home
he
would
make
for
them
in
the
desert
as
he
drove
his
team
and
held
the
bar
of
his
fresno
worked
the
harder
for
a
cheery
word
from
the
daughter
of
his
employer
and
every
evening
under
the
ramada
barbara
sat
with
her
father
often
alone
sometimes
with
one
or
more
of
her
little
court
and
always
the
talk
was
of
the
work
save
for
the
times
when
pablo
would
come
softly
to
make
music
for
his
senorita
and
then
they
would
sit
silently
listening
to
the
sweet
harmonies
that
floated
away
into
the
night
often
barbara
would
go
the
short
distance
from
the
house
to
the
old
wash
there
to
sit
almost
on
the
very
spot
where
her
mother
had
perished
beside
the
dry
water
hole
and
watching
the
stream
that
now
flowed
through
the
old
channel
or
looking
away
across
the
deep
cut
to
the
sand
hills
that
showed
clearly
in
the
distance
she
would
live
over
the
story
as
she
had
learned
it
that
day
with
texas
asking
the
old
old
question
to
which
there
was
still
no
answer
one
afternoon
as
she
was
sitting
there
two
wagons
with
a
small
party
of
men
appeared
on
the
high
bank
of
the
stream
opposite
as
the
men
climbed
down
from
their
seats
someone
on
horseback
rode
to
the
edge
of
the
cut
and
sat
for
a
moment
looking
across
even
at
that
distance
she
knew
him
it
was
willard
holmes
watching
she
saw
him
turn
and
by
his
motions
guessed
that
he
was
giving
some
instructions
to
the
men
then
he
rode
away
toward
the
crossing
quickly
barbara
returned
to
the
rude
porch
of
the
tent
house
and
in
a
few
minutes
saw
the
engineer
approach
dismounting
and
throwing
the
reins
over
his
horse
head
he
came
to
her
smiling
sombrero
in
hand
buenas
dias
senorita
please
may
i
have
a
drink
certainly
holmes
help
yourself
she
pointed
to
the
olla
hanging
in
the
shade
of
the
ramada
the
engineer
started
at
her
cool
reply
given
as
she
would
have
addressed
a
stranger
and
more
to
regain
his
composure
than
because
he
was
thirsty
helped
himself
from
the
earthen
water
jar
when
he
could
delay
no
longer
he
turned
again
to
her
and
forcing
himself
to
speak
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
the
lack
of
warmth
in
her
greeting
said
i
was
sorry
to
miss
you
in
town
i
called
several
times
i
am
keeping
house
here
for
father
she
answered
then
we
will
be
neighbors
he
said
with
assumed
lightness
at
least
neighbors
a
party
of
my
surveyors
will
be
camped
over
there
across
the
river
i
will
be
with
them
part
of
the
time
when
she
made
no
reply
to
this
the
man
understood
slowly
he
drew
on
his
gloves
and
laying
aside
all
pretense
said
simply
i
have
been
trying
to
see
you
miss
worth
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
myself
of
the
miserable
part
i
took
in
the
shameful
trick
my
uncle
attempted
to
play
on
your
father
i
see
that
you
know
all
about
it
and
i
realize
that
it
is
quite
useless
for
me
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
he
paused
but
still
the
young
woman
was
silent
illustration
more
to
regain
his
composure
than
because
he
was
thirsty
helped
himself
from
the
earthen
water
jar
the
man
could
not
know
how
she
was
fighting
to
keep
back
the
tears
you
told
me
plainly
that
you
could
never
forgive
one
who
was
untrue
to
his
work
he
went
on
hopelessly
and
you
are
right
there
was
a
time
before
i
knew
you
when
i
would
have
defended
my
action
when
i
would
have
held
that
it
was
right
but
i
can
not
now
perhaps
if
i
had
known
you
longer
but
what
the
use
i
am
a
sad
bungler
in
this
great
work
miss
worth
i
am
out
of
place
in
the
big
desert
i
should
have
stayed
at
home
i
wish
i
wish
you
had
never
wakened
me
to
the
possibilities
of
life
real
life
you
would
not
need
to
feel
ashamed
for
me
now
when
she
looked
up
he
was
mounting
his
horse
almost
she
cried
out
to
him
but
he
rode
quickly
out
of
her
sight
chapter
xxi
pablo
brings
news
to
barbara
all
through
the
long
hot
months
of
that
second
summer
barbara
stayed
in
the
desert
with
her
father
many
times
worth
insisted
that
she
should
go
to
the
coast
or
the
mountains
for
a
few
weeks
while
abe
texas
and
pat
added
their
entreaties
but
the
young
woman
answer
was
always
to
her
father
if
you
must
stay
daddy
then
i
must
stay
to
take
care
of
you
to
abe
it
was
why
do
you
take
a
vacation
this
is
just
as
much
my
work
as
it
is
yours
to
texas
it
was
a
laughing
question
whether
he
thought
she
was
a
quitter
and
to
pat
she
always
declared
that
the
desert
could
not
in
the
least
hurt
her
complexion
and
look
at
the
other
women
she
would
argue
there
was
jack
little
wife
with
their
children
in
a
twelve
by
fourteen
tent
out
there
on
their
claim
alone
all
day
and
many
nights
while
jack
was
on
the
work
and
white
who
stoutly
declared
that
she
was
sure
going
to
stand
by
her
jim
if
it
burned
her
to
a
crisp
and
that
they
did
not
have
the
money
to
spend
even
if
they
could
leave
the
crops
they
had
managed
to
plant
and
rollins
and
baird
and
cole
and
the
others
who
were
holding
down
their
husbands
claims
while
the
men
were
earning
money
on
the
works
to
help
them
in
getting
their
start
surely
if
these
women
could
stay
with
their
barbara
could
so
worth
let
her
have
her
way
and
the
other
three
strove
among
themselves
with
varied
and
picturesque
figures
of
speech
and
it
must
be
confessed
some
rather
strong
language
to
express
their
admiration
for
her
courage
and
endurance
while
all
four
taxed
their
inventive
powers
to
the
limit
devising
ways
to
add
to
her
comfort
the
work
in
the
south
central
district
continued
steadily
with
no
delay
through
lack
of
help
and
when
the
canal
was
finished
and
the
water
ready
the
men
who
had
built
it
turned
to
making
the
ditches
on
their
own
claims
leveling
their
land
for
irrigation
preparing
for
the
first
crops
and
making
what
other
improvements
they
could
meanwhile
the
new
townsite
was
laid
out
on
the
ground
already
occupied
by
the
headquarters
camp
and
the
camp
itself
became
the
town
of
barba
but
perhaps
because
as
pablo
said
there
was
no
senorita
in
the
company
greenfield
chief
engineer
again
found
it
hard
to
hold
his
men
through
the
hot
months
and
was
obliged
to
discontinue
work
on
their
central
main
holmes
himself
spent
the
weeks
of
the
flood
season
at
the
river
refusing
to
leave
even
for
a
day
three
times
when
conditions
at
the
intake
and
heading
were
most
critical
and
the
danger
that
threatened
the
unconscious
settlers
seemed
imminent
the
engineer
sent
for
abe
lee
while
texas
pat
and
pablo
were
instructed
by
worth
to
be
ready
at
an
hour
notice
to
move
the
entire
working
force
of
the
district
to
the
scene
of
the
expected
disaster
and
still
even
through
those
trying
times
jefferson
worth
continued
his
operations
in
all
parts
of
the
basin
and
started
various
enterprises
in
his
new
town
with
the
conviction
of
a
born
fatalist
though
he
almost
constantly
now
except
when
he
was
with
barbara
wore
that
expressionless
gray
mask
abe
lee
thin
face
burned
dark
by
constant
exposure
to
the
fierce
desert
sun
had
a
look
of
watchful
readiness
and
barbara
seeing
thought
that
it
was
all
because
of
the
strain
of
their
own
work
for
even
barbara
was
not
told
of
the
terrible
risk
that
the
company
was
forcing
the
pioneers
to
take
meanwhile
james
greenfield
and
the
company
officials
from
the
outside
watched
the
situation
with
the
calmness
of
professional
gamblers
watching
the
turn
of
the
cards
though
he
did
not
come
into
the
desert
during
the
summer
the
company
president
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
west
now
for
the
reclamation
project
launched
by
him
was
assuming
such
proportions
that
his
personal
attention
was
justified
only
one
thing
more
was
needed
to
bring
such
a
flood
of
speculators
and
investors
that
the
company
immense
profits
would
be
assured
the
new
country
must
have
a
railroad
to
this
end
in
the
city
by
the
sea
the
eastern
financier
was
bringing
every
influence
he
could
command
to
bear
upon
the
officials
of
the
southwestern
and
continental
that
skirted
the
rim
of
the
basin
but
the
great
man
who
shaped
the
destinies
of
the
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
his
road
controlled
the
only
pass
through
the
range
of
mountains
that
shut
in
the
new
country
for
some
reason
refused
to
build
a
branch
line
into
the
territory
in
which
greenfield
was
so
deeply
interested
james
greenfield
himself
a
power
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
financial
world
was
always
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
railroad
man
without
delay
and
was
always
received
by
the
official
with
every
courtesy
his
statements
as
to
the
extent
and
value
of
the
lands
that
were
being
developed
by
his
company
with
his
estimates
of
the
volume
of
business
that
a
branch
line
would
bring
to
the
southwestern
and
continental
were
received
without
question
the
railroad
man
even
betrayed
unusual
interest
in
the
reclamation
of
the
king
basin
desert
with
a
knowledge
of
conditions
almost
as
complete
as
greenfield
frequently
he
asked
of
jefferson
worth
operations
and
of
the
development
of
the
south
central
district
but
always
he
shook
his
head
when
greenfield
urged
immediate
action
there
were
certain
reasons
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
go
into
details
some
day
no
doubt
the
branch
line
would
be
built
but
he
could
make
no
promises
this
was
the
situation
in
the
fall
when
with
the
danger
from
the
river
past
and
his
canals
finished
jefferson
worth
sought
an
interview
with
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
at
his
office
in
the
coast
city
greenfield
received
the
banker
cordially
congratulated
him
upon
the
success
of
his
south
central
district
work
and
prophesied
great
things
for
everybody
interested
in
the
king
basin
project
jefferson
worth
behind
his
gray
mask
at
once
made
known
the
object
of
his
visit
he
wished
to
secure
from
the
company
the
right
to
take
water
from
their
central
main
for
a
small
power
house
to
be
located
in
the
dry
river
worth
explained
frankly
the
advantage
it
would
give
the
new
town
of
barba
in
which
he
was
interested
and
stated
that
he
had
some
time
before
laid
his
proposition
before
the
manager
in
order
that
greenfield
might
be
informed
of
the
matter
greenfield
said
that
he
had
heard
from
burk
and
that
he
thought
it
might
be
arranged
then
while
jefferson
worth
listened
with
his
usual
careful
attention
the
company
man
set
forth
their
great
need
of
a
railroad
and
by
the
way
was
worth
personally
acquainted
with
the
man
who
controlled
the
i
know
of
him
came
the
cautious
reply
well
worth
said
the
president
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
need
that
railroad
and
we
need
it
now
so
far
i
have
failed
to
get
any
definite
promise
from
the
that
they
will
give
us
a
branch
line
if
you
can
secure
a
railroad
for
the
basin
this
year
we
will
give
you
the
right
of
way
for
your
power
canal
and
a
contract
for
the
water
is
that
your
only
proposition
that
is
my
only
proposition
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
would
have
been
astonished
if
he
could
have
witnessed
the
meeting
of
jefferson
worth
and
the
railroad
man
an
hour
later
hello
jeff
came
in
hearty
tones
from
the
official
as
the
door
of
his
private
office
closed
behind
the
banker
how
are
you
i
hear
that
greenfield
sold
you
a
gold
brick
worth
smiled
while
the
other
laughed
heartily
i
tell
you
jeff
we
little
westerners
have
got
to
watch
out
for
these
big
eastern
operators
or
they
take
the
whole
blamed
country
away
from
us
the
gold
brick
is
panning
out
pretty
well
so
far
said
the
banker
so
i
understand
crawford
has
been
telling
me
all
about
it
in
fact
the
whole
king
basin
proposition
looks
mighty
good
to
me
except
for
that
new
york
bunch
i
afraid
of
them
jeff
greenfield
has
been
camping
on
my
trail
for
three
months
wanting
us
to
build
them
a
branch
line
i
told
crawford
yesterday
that
it
was
about
time
for
you
to
come
around
when
are
you
going
to
build
that
road
asked
worth
the
other
shook
his
head
ca
do
it
jeff
you
know
the
situation
as
well
as
i
if
the
river
comes
in
the
whole
country
will
go
to
smash
and
with
the
class
of
structures
they
have
put
in
to
control
it
and
with
an
eastern
engineer
in
charge
it
too
big
a
chance
the
is
not
spending
money
to
help
out
projects
promoted
by
eastern
capital
but
if
you
give
us
the
branch
line
it
will
insure
the
success
of
the
project
for
it
will
make
the
company
property
so
valuable
that
they
will
spend
more
money
to
protect
it
or
added
the
other
would
have
to
spend
more
money
to
protect
it
i
sorry
jeff
if
that
what
you
have
been
figuring
on
but
we
are
not
an
insurance
company
we
are
in
the
transportation
business
then
you
wo
build
into
the
basin
not
under
existing
conditions
jeff
with
as
little
show
of
emotion
as
he
would
have
exhibited
had
he
merely
proposed
to
purchase
a
morning
paper
jefferson
worth
said
all
right
then
i
build
it
myself
the
railroad
man
knew
that
the
quietly
spoken
words
meant
that
the
banker
had
determined
to
stake
everything
he
had
in
the
world
upon
a
chance
that
even
the
with
its
unlimited
capital
refused
to
take
with
his
already
large
investments
in
the
new
country
the
building
of
the
railroad
would
tax
worth
resources
to
the
very
limit
and
the
failure
of
the
company
project
would
mean
for
him
financial
ruin
during
the
flood
season
just
past
jefferson
worth
had
seen
the
safety
of
the
reclamation
work
hanging
on
a
very
slender
thread
every
hour
he
had
looked
for
the
disaster
that
would
bring
to
nothing
all
that
had
been
accomplished
by
the
desert
pioneers
whose
ruin
he
would
share
yet
he
calmly
proposed
now
to
throw
into
the
venture
everything
that
years
of
unceasing
toil
had
brought
him
his
capital
his
credit
his
reputation
do
do
it
jeff
said
his
friend
you
are
in
deep
enough
now
better
keep
an
anchor
to
windward
i
figured
on
taking
a
chance
when
i
went
into
that
country
said
worth
simply
it
was
as
if
he
had
foreseen
this
situation
from
the
very
beginning
and
had
planned
how
he
would
meet
it
the
railroad
man
face
expressed
his
admiration
for
this
display
of
nerve
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
let
me
know
jeff
thanks
if
you
would
just
not
mention
to
anyone
that
i
am
connected
with
this
for
a
little
while
oh
i
see
greenfield
again
i
suppose
what
are
you
up
to
anyway
jeff
buying
another
gold
brick
worth
explained
his
plan
for
a
power
plant
and
greenfield
proposition
hell
exclaimed
the
dignified
official
you
ca
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
build
a
railroad
into
greenfield
town
just
to
get
a
dinky
little
power
plant
in
your
own
district
i
not
from
new
york
jeff
to
which
jefferson
worth
answered
from
behind
his
mask
the
basin
needs
a
railroad
the
next
day
greenfield
sought
the
railroad
office
in
haste
i
understand
that
you
have
decided
to
build
that
branch
road
the
official
who
had
received
his
guest
with
the
dignified
courtesy
befitting
one
of
his
position
smiled
at
the
other
manner
as
a
gracious
sovereign
might
smile
on
granting
a
subject
petition
greenfield
accepted
the
smile
as
an
assent
may
i
ask
when
you
will
begin
the
work
i
can
not
say
exactly
greenfield
the
survey
will
probably
be
made
at
once
and
the
work
begun
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
to
assemble
men
and
material
when
the
king
basin
messenger
announced
that
the
survey
was
being
made
for
a
railroad
from
the
main
line
of
the
at
deep
well
to
kingston
it
did
not
mention
the
fact
that
abe
lee
was
in
charge
of
the
work
and
james
greenfield
who
signed
the
promised
contract
following
the
announcement
did
not
learn
until
the
next
issue
of
the
messenger
that
the
road
was
not
being
built
by
the
but
by
jefferson
worth
himself
quickly
the
news
that
the
railroad
was
building
into
the
king
basin
was
spread
by
the
papers
throughout
the
surrounding
country
and
from
every
side
the
swelling
flood
of
life
poured
in
every
section
of
the
new
lands
felt
the
influence
of
the
rush
for
miles
around
the
towns
every
vacant
tract
was
seized
by
the
incoming
settlers
townsite
companies
quickly
laid
out
new
towns
while
in
the
towns
already
established
new
business
blocks
and
dwellings
sprang
up
as
if
some
aladdin
had
rubbed
his
lamp
real
estate
values
advanced
to
undreamed
figures
and
the
property
was
sold
and
sold
again
and
kingston
the
heart
and
center
of
it
all
kingston
texas
joe
said
went
plumb
locoed
the
name
of
jefferson
worth
was
on
every
tongue
was
he
not
the
wizard
who
commanded
prosperity
and
wealth
to
wait
upon
the
king
basin
was
he
not
the
aladdin
who
rubbed
the
lamp
horace
blanton
who
seemed
to
increase
magically
as
if
indeed
he
fed
on
the
stuff
of
which
booms
are
made
did
not
lack
for
audience
now
as
he
talked
in
rolling
phrases
of
his
friend
worth
and
what
we
had
done
with
suggestive
hints
of
still
greater
things
that
we
again
would
do
to
see
the
great
horace
in
all
the
glory
of
white
vest
and
as
he
escorted
parties
of
newcomers
about
the
town
and
pointed
out
with
majestic
gestures
our
opera
house
our
bank
our
power
house
our
ice
plant
the
site
of
our
new
depot
was
an
experience
never
to
be
forgotten
to
watch
him
give
orders
when
pat
was
not
near
to
some
laborer
in
the
grading
gang
at
work
on
the
roadbed
and
yards
or
to
see
him
instructing
a
merchant
in
the
finer
points
of
his
business
was
a
delight
to
hear
him
speak
with
authority
upon
every
question
relating
to
the
king
basin
project
from
the
stage
of
the
water
in
the
river
two
years
before
the
first
survey
and
the
future
plans
of
jefferson
worth
to
the
chemical
properties
of
the
soil
the
proper
grade
for
irrigating
alfalfa
and
the
kinds
and
varieties
of
fruits
and
vegetables
best
adapted
to
the
climate
was
as
instructive
as
it
was
interesting
with
the
beginning
of
the
work
on
the
railroad
barbara
and
her
father
again
made
their
home
in
kingston
and
horace
blanton
whenever
he
could
escape
from
his
arduous
duties
endeavored
earnestly
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
jefferson
worth
daughter
there
was
no
mistaking
either
his
purpose
or
his
perfect
confidence
in
his
ability
to
achieve
success
many
and
ingenious
were
the
things
that
three
members
of
barbara
court
promised
each
other
should
happen
to
horace
it
was
on
one
of
those
afternoons
when
the
man
with
the
white
vest
was
making
himself
very
much
at
home
on
the
front
porch
of
the
worth
cottage
that
pablo
riding
in
from
the
south
central
district
sought
la
senorita
dismounting
from
his
tired
horse
the
mexican
his
spurs
clanking
on
the
walk
approached
barbara
and
with
his
sombrero
brushing
the
ground
greeted
her
in
his
native
tongue
turning
an
inquiring
eye
meanwhile
upon
the
portly
horace
barbara
returned
his
greeting
in
spanish
following
her
words
in
english
with
this
is
senor
blanton
pablo
blanton
this
is
my
friend
pablo
garcia
the
white
man
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
lordly
gesture
the
mexican
with
a
gleam
of
his
white
teeth
said
i
have
the
pleasure
to
see
the
senor
sometimes
before
he
is
what
they
call
booster
i
have
hear
him
talk
many
times
on
street
then
to
barbara
i
am
come
quick
senorita
to
find
senor
worth
or
senor
lee
you
know
if
it
is
far
to
where
they
are
i
ride
fast
my
horse
is
tired
before
the
young
woman
could
answer
the
big
man
with
a
voice
of
authority
said
you
will
find
them
out
on
the
line
of
the
railroad
somewhere
between
here
and
deep
well
just
follow
the
grade
you
miss
it
pablo
should
have
considered
himself
dismissed
but
ignoring
blanton
he
waited
for
barbara
answer
i
do
know
just
where
they
are
pablo
you
had
better
wait
until
they
come
in
is
there
anything
wrong
the
mexican
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
another
glance
toward
her
companion
i
can
not
say
senorita
there
is
no
what
you
call
accident
but
i
think
better
i
come
what
is
it
my
man
said
horace
again
interrupting
i
will
see
worth
about
it
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
you
have
no
business
troubling
miss
worth
barbara
slippered
toe
tapped
the
floor
nervously
although
barbara
was
not
a
nervous
young
woman
pablo
with
another
shrug
said
coldly
it
is
to
tell
senor
worth
or
senor
lee
that
i
come
if
la
senorita
tells
me
i
trouble
her
that
is
different
the
young
woman
spoke
put
your
horse
in
the
barn
pablo
and
then
come
in
i
know
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
morning
and
you
are
all
tired
out
ynez
is
away
but
i
will
find
something
for
you
and
you
can
rest
here
until
father
comes
pablo
retreated
and
barbara
rising
said
you
will
excuse
me
mr
blanton
are
you
going
to
let
that
greaser
spoil
our
afternoon
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
offended
majesty
the
girl
laughed
outright
you
are
so
funny
when
you
puff
yourself
up
that
way
and
try
to
look
so
kingly
pray
how
is
this
afternoon
what
is
left
of
it
belongs
to
pablo
i
am
going
to
find
him
something
to
eat
and
then
i
mean
to
talk
to
him
every
minute
until
father
comes
you
may
stay
if
you
like
but
we
shall
talk
in
spanish
the
face
of
horace
blanton
expressed
fat
anguish
rising
he
went
closer
and
stood
over
her
with
a
look
which
he
imagined
to
be
a
look
of
melting
tenderness
and
in
a
voice
that
fairly
dripped
with
honeyed
sweetness
he
began
miss
worth
barbara
i
sir
if
barbara
had
shot
the
word
at
him
from
texas
it
could
not
have
been
more
effective
i
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
worth
he
stammered
certainly
certainly
by
all
means
miss
worth
and
that
was
as
near
as
horace
blanton
ever
came
to
achieving
the
success
of
which
he
was
so
confident
a
few
minutes
later
pablo
without
hesitation
told
barbara
what
had
brought
him
to
kingston
a
mexican
friend
who
worked
for
the
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
had
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
company
manager
and
the
chief
engineer
who
were
together
inspecting
the
work
on
the
central
main
canal
dropping
into
his
quaint
english
pablo
repeated
what
his
friend
had
told
him
senor
holmes
he
say
canal
will
go
here
where
the
stakes
are
set
senor
burk
say
you
shall
go
that
other
way
that
will
leave
the
power
house
away
eight
miles
and
the
elevation
it
is
not
the
same
say
senor
holmes
senor
burk
say
house
is
not
our
this
way
is
good
for
us
holmes
no
like
it
he
is
very
mad
say
my
friend
he
say

not
do
it
then
senor
burk
say

you
lose
your
job
greenfield
say
it
must
go
there
it
is
an
order
then
they
go
and
my
friend
he
tell
me
he
think
maybe
it
is
no
good
for
power
house
i
think
maybe
so
senor
worth
like
to
know
the
next
morning
jefferson
worth
called
upon
the
manager
of
the
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
burk
i
understand
that
you
are
changing
the
line
of
your
central
canal
we
are
but
my
contract
with
your
company
must
be
considered
we
have
already
considered
it
worth
it
relates
only
to
the
delivery
of
a
certain
amount
of
water
into
your
canal
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
binds
us
to
build
canal
on
the
line

insulted
and
mocked
and
the
unspeakable
villain
the
sordid
wretch
the
miserable
gamester
who
had
ruined
kingston
was
jefferson
worth
it
is
unknown
to
this
day
who
first
brought
the
news
that
all
work
on
the
railroad
for
a
distance
of
seven
miles
out
from
kingston
was
stopped
and
that
the
camps
with
their
entire
outfits
had
disappeared
leaving
the
scenes
of
their
stirring
activity
as
still
and
lifeless
as
if
they
had
never
existed
next
it
was
known
that
from
deep
well
southward
the
construction
train
was
still
pushing
its
way
into
the
basin
and
that
the
work
ahead
of
the
train
went
on
then
while
kingston
was
wondering
questioning
discussing
the
word
went
quickly
around
that
the
grading
crews
were
setting
up
their
camps
twelve
miles
east
of
the
company
town
and
that
a
line
of
stakes
led
one
way
to
the
town
of
barba
and
the
other
way
in
the
direction
to
meet
the
construction
train
working
out
from
the
junction
with
the
at
deep
well
then
the
startled
people
grasped
the
truth
of
the
appalling
situation
and
awoke
from
their
dream
in
the
line
of
the
railroad
survey
that
had
led
to
kingston
as
straight
as
you
could
draw
a
string
there
was
now
a
curve
seven
miles
away
the
tangent
of
which
would
carry
it
twelve
miles
east
of
the
company
town
and
straight
into
barba
practically
all
business
ceased
while
the
citizens
in
knots
and
groups
discussed
the
situation
jefferson
worth
was
in
the
coast
city
and
telegrams
to
him
all
save
one
received
no
answer
to
a
message
from
burk
he
replied
that
the
line
had
been
changed
by
his
orders
as
for
abe
lee
they
might
as
well
have
questioned
one
of
the
grade
stakes
even
barbara
besought
by
the
distracted
citizens
could
tell
them
nothing
except
that
her
father
would
return
saturday
there
was
nothing
to
do
save
to
wait
for
worth
and
to
prepare
for
his
coming
when
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
arrived
on
the
scene
in
answer
to
an
urgent
wire
from
his
manager
he
was
at
once
the
center
of
public
interest
but
greenfield
escaped
quickly
from
the
crowd
at
the
hotel
and
was
very
soon
closeted
with
burk
in
the
office
then
a
boy
found
horace
blanton
horace
was
not
hard
to
find
with
the
word
that
greenfield
desired
to
see
him
immediately
horace
blanton
increased
visibly
so
visibly
that
the
spectators
watched
the
white
vest
with
no
little
anxiety
tell
greenfield
that
i
will
see
him
immediately
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
easily
heard
across
the
street
then
horace
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
company
office
a
full
length
ahead
of
the
messenger
an
hour
later
when
blanton
reappeared
to
the
public
eye
the
white
vest
could
no
longer
be
buttoned
over
his
expanding
importance
and
beads
of
portentous
dignity
stood
on
his
massive
brow
what
did
greenfield
want
what
was
the
company
going
to
do
the
crowd
demanded
eagerly
from
his
lofty
height
the
great
one
answered
our
company
president
simply
desired
my
opinion
and
advice
in
this
little
difficulty
as
to
what
we
will
do
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
make
a
public
statement
but
that
but
was
filled
with
tremendous
potential
power
did
greenfield
know
that
the
change
in
the
railroad
line
was
contemplated
certainly
not
he
learned
of
it
first
from
the
telegram
that
called
him
to
kingston
why
was
the
change
in
the
road
made
horace
blanton
smiled
it
was
very
easy
to
understand
if
they
would
look
over
this
man
worth
operations
since
he
had
been
in
the
basin
what
had
he
done
first
he
had
quietly
invested
heavily
in
kingston
real
estate
next
he
had
as
quietly
through
his
various
companies
and
agents
gained
control
of
all
the
public
utilities
in
the
new
country
then
he
had
so
manipulated
things
that
he
gained
absolute
control
of
the
whole
south
central
district
one
of
the
richest
sections
of
the
basin
and
had
started
the
town
of
barba
on
land
owned
by
himself
his
next
move
was
to
gain
control
of
the
railroad
which
as
every
one
knew
was
started
as
an
line
remember
said
the
perspiring
master
of
affairs
that
when
this
man
worth
began
work
on
the
railroad
into
kingston
he
still
owned
a
large
amount
of
kingston
real
estate
with
buildings
and
business
establishments
you
will
find
that
save
for
the
newspaper
the
telephone
line
the
power
plant
the
ice
plant
the
bank
and
his
home
he
does
not
own
a
foot
of
land
a
building
or
a
business
establishment
in
kingston
what
has
he
done
he
used
the
railroad
to
start
a
boom
in
our
beautiful
little
city
then
sold
out
at
an
immense
profit
and
now
having
no
further
interest
in
kingston
changes
the
line
of
his
road
to
barba
the
town
that
he
owns
leaving
us
to
make
the
most
of
the
situation
the
orator
impressive
climax
called
forth
from
every
hearer
furious
invectives
against
the
absent
financier
following
the
announcement
of
the
coming
of
the
road
to
kingston
the
name
of
jefferson
worth
had
been
on
every
tongue
the
same
name
was
on
every
tongue
now
but
the
man
that
had
been
hailed
as
the
good
genius
of
the
reclamation
was
now
cursed
for
a
selfish
fiend
who
would
lay
waste
the
whole
country
for
his
own
greedy
ends
horace
blanton
exhausted
both
himself
and
the
english
language
in
a
lurid
picturesque
and
vigorous
delineation
of
the
character
of
this
monstrous
enemy
of
the
race
it
was
such
pirates
as
jefferson
worth
who
by
preying
upon
legitimate
business
interests
and
coining
for
themselves
the
of
the
people
made
it
so
hard
for
such
public
benefactors
as
james
greenfield
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
country
it
was
beautiful
to
see
how
the
speaker
appreciated
the
splendid
character
matchless
genius
and
noble
life
of
his
friend
greenfield
the
distinguished
president
of
the
king
basin
company
and
the
father
of
reclamation
some
day
he
declared
the
citizens
of
the
reclaimed
desert
looking
over
their
magnificent
farms
and
beautiful
homes
would
appreciate
the
work
of
this
man
and
understand
then
as
they
could
not
now
how
he
had
toiled
in
their
interests
as
for
this
fellow
jefferson
worth
dark
and
dreadful
were
the
hints
that
horace
dropped
as
to
his
future
it
was
horace
blanton
who
arranged
for
a
public
indignation
meeting
in
the
worth
opera
house
the
afternoon
of
jefferson
worth
expected
return
when
the
day
arrived
kingston
entertained
the
largest
crowd
that
had
ever
gathered
within
the
boundaries
of
the
town
for
word
of
the
situation
had
traveled
throughout
the
basin
and
from
every
corner
of
the
new
country
men
came
to
the
scene
of
the
excitement
to
attend
the
and
to
be
present
when
the
man
that
threatened
kingston
with
ruin
should
appear
teamsters
left
their
teams
and
fresnos
on
the
company
works
ranchers
left
their
crops
and
cattle
newly
located
settlers
forsook
their
ditching
and
leveling
zanjeros
deserted
their
water
gates
and
levees
bold
hardy
venturesome
spirits
these
were
with
bodies
toughened
by
hard
toil
in
the
open
air
and
faces
blackened
and
bronzed
by
constant
exposure
to
the
sun
for
the
desert
did
not
yield
to
weaklings
who
would
submit
tamely
to
being
skillfully
juggled
out
of
their
own
by
a
manipulator
of
business
under
the
natural
curiosity
and
love
of
entertainment
that
drew
these
strong
roughly
dressed
roughly
speaking
pioneers
to
the
point
of
interest
there
was
an
of
grim
determination
to
protect
their
new
country
from
the
schemes
of
unprincipled
corporations
it
was
an
old
old
story
at
the
there
were
many
vigorous
speeches
by
ones
a
masterly
address
by
horace
blanton
and
because
he
could
not
escape
this
a
few
words
by
james
greenfield
who
was
introduced
by
blanton
as
the
father
of
the
king
basin
reclamation
work
and
received
by
the
citizens
with
generous
applause
acting
upon
greenfield
suggestion
a
committee
was
appointed
to
wait
upon
worth
immediately
upon
his
arrival
and
the
meeting
adjourned
until
nine
that
evening
when
the
committee
would
report
as
the
eventful
day
drew
near
its
close
horsemen
from
the
south
central
district
began
to
arrive
these
were
the
men
who
had
worked
for
jefferson
worth
on
the
canals
and
who
through
him
were
now
developing
ranches
of
their
own
these
south
central
men
scattered
quietly
through
the
crowd
and
soon
in
every
group
there
was
one
or
more
of
the
listening
attentively
and
it
was
a
significant
though
in
that
country
an
unnoticed
fact
that
every
man
from
jefferson
district
wore
the
familiar
of
the
west
but
these
attentive
ones
took
no
part
in
the
discussions
speaking
neither
in
defense
nor
in
condemnation
of
the
man
who
had
so
stirred
the
public
indignation
as
the
hour
for
the
arrival
of
the
stage
approached
the
crowd
massed
in
front
of
the
hotel
filling
the
lobby
the
arcade
and
the
street
and
still
scattered
through
the
throng
were
the
men
from
the
south
central
district
when
the
stage
was
seen
in
the
distance
a
low
murmur
like
the
threatening
rumble
of
a
coming
storm
arose
from
the
mass
of
men
and
following
this
a
hush
like
the
hush
of
nature
before
the
storm
breaks
into
and
through
the
strangely
silent
crowd
the
driver
of
the
six
broncos
forced
his
frightened
team
as
the
stage
stopped
and
the
passengers
looking
curiously
down
into
the
excited
faces
of
the
throng
prepared
to
alight
a
murmur
arose
the
murmur
swelled
into
a
roar
jefferson
worth
was
not
there
when
the
main
line
train
discharged
its
basin
passengers
at
the
junction
that
afternoon
the
engine
of
the
construction
train
on
the
new
road
brought
worth
as
far
as
the
rails
were
laid
here
texas
joe
with
a
fast
team
and
light
buckboard
was
waiting
so
it
happened
that
while
the
crowd
was
massing
in
front
of
the
hotel
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
stage
jefferson
worth
was
at
his
home
quietly
eating
his
supper
and
reassuring
his
frightened
daughter
when
the
assembled
pioneers
learned
from
the
stage
driver
that
the
man
they
waited
for
had
left
the
junction
on
the
engine
they
were
not
long
in
arriving
at
the
truth
the
excitement
inflamed
by
what
seemed
the
fear
of
jefferson
worth
and
increased
by
the
judicious
efforts
of
horace
blanton
was
intense
from
an
orderly
company
of
indignant
citizens
waiting
to
interview
a
public
man
the
crowd
became
a
mob
pursuing
an
escaping
victim
with
shouts
and
yells
they
started
for
the
worth
home
and
with
them
went
the
quiet
men
from
the
south
central
district
as
the
sound
of
the
approaching
crowd
reached
the
two
at
the
table
barbara
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
white
with
fear
daddy
coming
they
coming
she
whispered
trembling
with
anxiety
for
her
father
safety

but
jefferson

coffee
with
which
he
always
finished
his
meal
returned
calmly
sit
down
barbara
i
wo
need
el
capitan
as
he
spoke
the
crowd
arrived
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
as
if
to
confirm
his
words
a
sudden
peaceful
silence
followed
the
uproar
of
their
coming
on
the
front
porch
in
the
red
level
light
of
the
sun
that
across
the
desert
was
just
touching
the
topmost
ridge
of
no
man
mountains
stood
the
tall
texas
joe
the
irish
gladiator
pat
and
the
lean
sinewy
man
of
the
desert
abe
lee
while
quietly
pushing
and
elbowing
their
way
to
the
front
were
the
men
from
the
south
central
district
the
quiet
was
broken
by
the
slow
drawling
voice
of
texas
joe
boys
what
for
is
the
stampede
trusts
you
ai
aimin
to
tromp
out
the
grass
none
on
worth
premises
within
the
house
barbara
and
her
father
heard
the
drawling
challenge
and
the
color
returned
to
the
young
woman
cheeks
as
she
smiled
and
whispered
good
old
uncle
tex
there
was
in
that
soft
southern
voice
an
undercurrent
of
such
cool
readiness
such
confident
mastery
of
the
situation
that
her
fears
vanished
nor
was
the
crowd
in
front
slow
to
recognize
that
which
reassured
barbara
for
a
moment
following
texas
joe
greeting
there
was
a
restless
shifting
to
and
fro
in
the
crowd
then
the
impressive
bulk
of
horace
blanton
detached
itself
from
the
common
herd
with
hands
uplifted
and
a
gesture
of
mingled
command
and
appeal
he
called
no
violence
men
no
violence
for
god
sake
do
shoot
let
me
talk
a
minute
whether
he
appealed
to
the
three
men
on
the
porch
or
to
the
company
behind
him
was
not
clear
but
texas
answered
has
the
floor
as
usual
senator
i
do
reckon
anybody
here
will
be
so
impolite
as
to
interrupt
your
remarks

worth
at
home
he
sure
is
altogether
and
very
much
to
home
could
we
ah
see
him
to
ask
about
a
matter
that
concerns
vitally
every
gentleman
in
this
company
horace
was
regaining
his
breath
and
his
poise
at
the
same
time
worth
just
at
this
minute
is
engaged
with
his
daughter
at
the
supper
table
his
superintendent
lee
is
present
and
will
be
glad
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
the
exact
formal
politeness
of
the
old
plainsman
was
delightful
in
spite
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
several
in
the
crowd
chuckled
audibly
worth
will
see
your
committee
said
abe
crisply
the
citizens
had
forgotten
their
committee
horace
blanton
had
made
it
difficult
to
remember
three
men
now
came
out
of
the
crowd
at
different
points
and
went
forward
james
greenfield
orator
following
them
to
the
porch
but
as
the
men
came
up
the
steps
abe
spoke
in
a
low
tone
to
his
companions
and
blanton
found
his
way
barred
by
the
solid
bulk
of
pat
were
you
also
appointed
to
interview
mr
worth
asked
abe
dryly
i
understood
it

a
committee
of

an
presintable
deminsions
at
this
the
crowd
laughed
outright
for
not
one
of
those
hardy
pioneers
but
knew
the
real
value
of
horace
blanton
to
the
reclamation
work
and
therefore
the
force
of
the
irish
boss
remarks
while
pat
and
against
his
will
the
company
representative
were
amusing
the
crowd
abe
led
the
committee
to
jefferson
worth
one
of
these
men
was
a
prominent
merchant
who
for
the
first
eight
months
of
his
business
in
kingston
had
occupied
a
in
one
of
buildings
rent
free
another
was
a
real
estate
man
whom
the
banker
had
supplied
with
funds
that
enabled
him
to
make
several
profitable
deals
that
would
otherwise
have
been
lost
the
other
man
was
a
successful
rancher
who
owned
a
of
improved
land
joining
the
townsite
deck
jordan
had
carried
him
at
the
store
for
implements
seed
and
provisions
the
first
two
years
jefferson
worth
greeted
them
in
his
habitually
colorless
voice
and
they
striving
to
see
behind
that
gray
mask
felt
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
situation
that
had
not
appeared
on
the
surface
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
situation
had
been
made
so
clear
by
horace
blanton
after
his
interview
with
the
president
of
the
company
this
quiet
voiced
man
who
had
been
so
ready
to
help
every
worthy
settler
in
the
new
country
did
not
appear
at
all
the
monster
in
disguise
that
the
chief
speaker
at
the
had
pictured
the
committee
free
from
the
heat
of
the
crowd
and
the
eloquence
of
horace
felt
just
a
little
ashamed
worth
said
the
spokesman
with
a
smile
we
were
appointed
to
interview
you
about
this
railroad
business
what
do
you
wish
to
know
gordon
well
first
is
it
true
that
you
have
sold
out
practically
all
of
your
property
in
kingston
yes
it
was
my
property
jefferson
worth
did
not
explain
that
he
had
sold
because
he
was
forced
to
turn
everything
he
could
into
cash
in
order
to
build
the
railroad
so
badly
needed
by
the
new
country
the
committee
looked
serious
is
it
true
continued
the
spokesman
that
you
are
changing
the
line
of
the
railroad
so
as
to
take
it
to
barba
and
leave
kingston
out
entirely
the
line
of
the
road
is
changed
came
the
exact
colorless
answer
will
it
be
possible
to
make
some
arrangement
by
which
you
would
carry
out
your
former
plan
and
build
the
road
into
kingston
you
mean
a
bonus
yes
i
not
in
the
market
is
there
nothing
that
we
can
do
to
change
the
situation
the
answer
startled
the
committee
tell
greenfield
that
he
had
better
see
me
himself
jefferson
worth
relation
to
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
was
always
a
much
discussed
question
among
the
pioneers
the
new
country
was
settled
by
working
people
of
limited
means
and
if
there
is
one
belief
common
to
this
class
it
is
that
all
capitalists
are
members
of
one
great
robber
band
perfectly
organized
firmly
united
and
operating
in
perfect
harmony
against
their
helpless
victim
the
public
however
much
they
might
fight
among
themselves
over
the
division
of
the
spoils
they
were
a
unit
in
their
common
operations
against
the
masses
from
the
first
jefferson
worth
was
held
by
many
to
be
the
secret
agent
the
silent
of
greenfield
and
the
south
central
district
seemed
to
justify
this
opinion
for
of
course
the
public
knew
nothing
of
the
inside
of
that
deal
the
people
accepted
worth
personal
assistance
cheerfully
thankfully
and
had
come
to
look
upon
him
as
a
friend
but
this
did
not
in
the
least
alter
their
belief
that
he
belonged
to
the
band
he
was
simply
a
generous
gentlemanly
sort
of
robber
kin
to
the
man
who
returns
the
railroad
tickets
of
the
passengers
and
refuses
to
rob
the
ladies
this
railroad
situation
had
seemed
to
deny
the
relationship
between
the
banker
and
the
company
and
now
came
worth
advice
tell
greenfield
that
he
had
better
see
me
himself
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
members
of
the
committee
looked
at
each
other
startled
and
bewildered
was
it
after
all
a
fight
between
the
members
of
the
band
over
the
division
of
the
spoils
it
was
too
deep
for
the
committee
they
could
feel
dimly
that
mighty
forces
were
stirring
beneath
the
surface
but
they
could
not
fathom
what
it
was
all
about
one
thing
was
clear
the
one
thing
that
is
always
clear
when
capital
speaks
to
business
men
of
their
class
they
must
obey
what
shall
we
report
to
the
crowd
they
asked
as
they
arose
to
go
i
figured
that
you
would
tell
them
what
i
have
told
you
came
the
answer
the
crowd
when
the
committee
briefly
reported
their
interview
were
as
puzzled
as
the
members
of
the
committee
and
questioned
and
discussed
affirmed
and
denied
until
pat
said
to
his
companions
on
the
porch
that
it
sounded
like
a
flock
av
domned
bumble
bees
when
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
who
dared
not
refuse
the
request
of
the
committee
stood
before
jefferson
worth
the
man
behind
the
gray
mask
forced
him
to
speak
first
i
understand
you
wished
to
see
me
about
this
railroad
matter
mr
worth
i
told
the
committee
that
you
had
better
see
me
came
the
answer
without
a
trace
of
emotion
in
the
colorless
voice
well
i
am
here
what
do
you
want
i
want
a
new
contract
from
your
company
binding
you
to
build
your
central
main
canal
on
the
line
of
the
original
survey
bringing
it
to
a
point
within
four
hundred
yards
of
the
west
line
of
the
south
central
district
where
the
san
felipe
trail
crosses
dry
river
and
agreeing
to
deliver
into
my
power
canal
without
charge
a
flow
of
three
hundred
second
feet
of
water
as
in
the
old
contract
and
in
addition
the
exclusive
power
rights
in
all
of
the
company
canals
in
the
basin
if
i
give
you
this
contract
you
will
build
the
railroad
into
kingston
when
you
change
the
line
of
your
canal
back
to
the
original
route
i
will
change
the
line
of
my
road
suppose
i
refuse
my
railroad
will
not
come
into
kingston
and
i
will
explain
to
the
crowd
out
there
the
reason
you
have
worked
up
a
pretty
strong
public
feeling
against
me
greenfield
now
make
good
or
stand
in
my
place
and
take
the
consequences
james
greenfield
was
not
slow
to
grasp
the
point
a
simple
explanation
of
the
situation
from
jefferson
worth
with
the
old
contract
to
back
it
up
would
turn
the
wrath
of
the
people
against
the
company
president
rising
he
said
with
an
oath
you
win
worth
i
have
the
contract
ready
for
your
signature
in
the
morning
now
what
will
we
do
with
that
mob
out
there
it
is
your
mob
greenfield
answered
jefferson
worth
a
few
minutes
later
from
the
front
porch
of
the
worth
cottage
with
texas
joe
on
his
right
hand
and
pat
on
his
left
horace
blanton
announced
our
committee
will
report
at
the
opera
house
in
half
an
hour
the
committee
reported
that
kingston
was
saved
and
the
orator
of
the
day
made
another
speech
so
far
eclipsing
all
his
former
efforts
that
the
cheering
citizens
were
evenly
divided
as
to
whether
it
was
james
greenfield
jefferson
worth
or
horace
blanton
who
saved
it
well
boys
remarked
one
of
the
men
from
the
south
central
district
as
the
little
party
of
horsemen
set
out
for
the
long
ride
home
one
thing
is
sure
those
kingston
fellows
have
got
the
railroad
but
we
still
have
jefferson
worth
an
i
reckon
that
jeff
can
build
us
a
railroad
any
old
time
he
gets
ready
that
right
returned
another
but
what
in
hell
do
you
suppose
it
was
all
about
what
jeff
game
anyhow
chapter
xxiii
exacting
royal
tribute
in
spite
of
the
optimistic
view
of
the
man
who
said
that
jefferson
worth
could
build
a
railroad
for
barba
and
the
south
central
district
whenever
he
wished
there
was
no
little
disappointment
expressed
in
worth
town
when
it
became
known
that
the
company
town
was
to
have
the
road
when
the
grading
camps
had
returned
to
their
former
locations
and
the
construction
train
drew
every
day
nearer
kingston
with
the
time
approaching
when
regular
trains
with
passengers
and
freight
would
ply
to
and
from
the
company
town
the
feeling
of
discontent
in
barba
grew
it
even
came
to
be
generally
understood
throughout
the
basin
that
the
whole
movement
had
been
cleverly
planned
by
jefferson
worth
to
force
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
to
make
a
large
contribution
to
the
railroad
builder
personal
fortune
the
people
sensed
something
in
the
whole
transaction
that
they
could
not
clearly
grasp
an
intangible
mysterious
something
as
great
as
it
was
indefinite
they
felt
blindly
that
they
were
being
used
without
their
consent
in
a
game
played
by
these
master
financiers
and
they
resented
being
sacrificed
as
dumb
pawns
in
a
move
the
purpose
of
which
they
could
not
know
in
the
meantime
while
the
people
were
charging
him
with
selling
them
out
to
gain
his
own
ends
the
man
whose
purpose
was
known
only
to
himself
was
putting
into
his
enterprise
the
last
dollar
of
his
resources
and
another
flood
season
with
its
appalling
danger
was
at
hand
because
his
laborers
on
the
railroad
were
not
as
the
men
who
built
the
south
central
canals
working
for
more
than
their
day
wage
and
because
though
no
one
knew
it
jefferson
worth
finances
were
so
nearly
exhausted
work
on
the
road
as
on
the
company
project
was
discontinued
for
the
summer
months
to
be
resumed
in
the
fall
perhaps
barbara
again
refused
to
leave
her
father
and
in
the
close
companionship
and
full
understanding
of
his
daughter
the
man
who
lived
so
much
alone
behind
his
gray
mask
found
inspiration
and
strength
the
telephone
now
connected
the
heading
at
the
river
intake
with
kingston
and
every
hour
of
those
hot
days
and
nights
jefferson
worth
listened
for
a
call
from
willard
holmes
who
also
had
refused
to
leave
his
work
while
three
of
the
fastest
saddle
horses
in
the
basin
were
stabled
with
el
capitan
texas
abe
and
pablo
were
ready
to
ride
at
an
instant
notice
to
rally
the
pioneers
who
were
developing
their
ranches
building
their
homes
and
planning
their
future
unconscious
of
the
real
danger
that
hung
over
them
vague
rumors
of
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
company
structures
floated
about
and
there
were
not
wanting
prophecies
of
disaster
but
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
the
settlers
had
even
visited
the
intake
at
the
river
or
if
they
had
what
could
they
judge
of
conditions
there
the
settlers
were
ranchers
not
civil
engineers
the
company
zanjeros
turned
the
water
into
their
ditches
when
they
asked
for
it
their
crops
growing
marvelously
in
the
rich
soil
demanded
constant
attention
they
had
neither
time
inclination
nor
ability
to
investigate
every
flying
rumor
as
for
the
prophets
of
evil
only
confirmed
optimists
can
reclaim
a
desert
or
settle
a
new
country
and
the
croakers
received
little
attention
besides
the
great
company
would
surely
protect
its
own
interests
and
in
protecting
its
own
would
protect
the
interests
of
the
settlers
it
was
the
business
of
the
company
engineers
to
look
after
the
river
the
ranchers
were
looking
after
the
ranches
thus
another
summer
went
by
and
the
great
river
save
for
the
small
toll
taken
by
those
who
were
reclaiming
the
desert
it
had
created
in
the
ages
of
long
ago
continued
on
its
way
to
the
sea
its
time
was
not
yet
with
the
return
of
the
cooler
weather
and
the
still
further
increase
in
the
volume
of
new
life
that
continued
to
pour
into
the
basin
from
the
great
world
outside
work
on
the
railroad
was
begun
again
but
jefferson
worth
knew
that
the
first
pay
day
would
mark
the
end
he
was
as
a
man
with
his
back
to
a
wall
fighting
bravely
to
the
last
blow
and
he
stood
alone
among
the
hundreds
of
pioneers
with
whom
worth
had
elected
as
he
had
told
abe
lee
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
kingston
to
take
a
chance
there
was
not
one
to
take
a
chance
with
him
now
if
he
lost
he
would
lose
alone
for
those
who
had
built
upon
the
work
that
he
had
done
would
not
suffer
through
his
defeat
had
any
of
them
known
the
situation
they
could
have
done
nothing
to
help
him
but
no
one
knew
and
this
was
the
financier
one
desperate
chance
that
no
one
did
know
not
even
barbara
with
his
capital
exhausted
and
no
resources
upon
which
he
could
realize
he
went
ahead
with
the
work
apparently
with
the
confidence
of
one
with
millions
behind
him
it
was
in
the
language
of
the
west
all
a
bluff
but
it
was
a
magnificent
bluff
two
weeks
of
the
month
were
gone
when
a
telegram
from
the
high
official
of
the
summoned
him
to
the
city
the
railroad
man
in
the
secrecy
of
his
private
office
greeted
the
promoter
with
his
usual
hello
jeff
i
see
the
king
basin
is
still
on
the
map
jefferson
worth
smiled
then
as
the
official
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
in
a
way
that
he
understood
he
retreated
behind
his
mask
things
are
going
very
well
he
answered
working
full
gangs
on
that
railroad
of
yours
we
have
taken
on
all
the
men
we
can
handle
we
will
be
ready
for
that
last
lot
of
steel
in
another
two
weeks
the
other
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
with
hearty
admiration
and
regard
jeff
you
are
a
wonder
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
would
take
greenfield
to
start
something
with
your
creditors
if
he
knew
what
i
know
not
a
line
of
jefferson
worth
face
changed
only
his
nervous
fingers
caressed
his
chin
and
the
railroad
man
noting
the
familiar
signal
smiled
again
then
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
he
said
jeff
i
have
been
keeping
my
eye
on
you
ever
since
those
days
when
our
line
was
building
into
rubio
city
and
you
handled
the
for
us
i
have
never
caught
you
in
a
blunder
yet
when
it
comes
to
sizing
up
a
proposition
all
around
i
do
believe
you
have
an
equal
now
look
here
with
a
quick
movement
he
took
a
paper
from
a
in
his
desk
and
laid
it
before
the
other
the
paper
was
a
carefully
tabulated
statement
of
jefferson
worth
financial
condition
at
that
moment
in
vain
the
official
tried
to
see
behind
that
gray
mask
well
the
word
was
absolutely
colorless
well
repeated
the
other
savagely
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
why
in
hell
you
are
bucking
greenfield
and
his
crowd
to
such
a
limit
because
said
jefferson
worth
carefully
i
believe
in
the
future
of
the
king
basin
project
providing
he
paused
providing
what
providing
someone
bucks
greenfield
to
the
limit
in
one
instantaneous
flash
the
man
whose
clear
brain
directed
thousands
of
miles
of
a
great
railroad
system
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
real
jefferson
worth
the
jefferson
worth
who
was
not
as
the
railroad
man
had
himself
said
doing
it
all
for
a
dinky
little
power
plant
jeff
he
said
slowly
when
you
asked
us
to
build
a
branch
line
into
the
basin
i
told
you
that
we
could
do
it
as
i
said
then
we
are
not
in
the
insurance
business
a
railroad
business
depends
upon
the
actual
development
of
a
country
not
upon
backing
promoters
who
open
up
a
new
country
simply
as
a
speculative
proposition
you
say
you
believe
in
the
future
of
the
king
basin
country
providing
some
one
bucks
greenfield
and
you
are
sure
giving
him
a
run
for
his
money
but
you
have
reached
the
end
of
your
pile
and
i
know
it
now
i
have
been
taking
up
this
matter
with
our
people
and
we
are
ready
to
take
a
chance
on
your
judgment
suppose
we
take
over
your
road
as
it
stands
at
a
fair
price
what
would
be
your
next
move
get
out
and
leave
us
in
the
insurance
business
i
would
build
a
line
from
kingston
to
barba
tapping
the
south
central
district
which
is
the
richest
section
of
the
basin
came
the
instant
reply
good
but
perhaps
you
do
want
to
sell
the
line
you
are
building
to
the
he
suggested
with
a
smile
i
figured
that
you
would
be
ready
to
make
me
a
proposition
about
the
time
i
had
it
in
shape
for
the
last
shipment
of
steel
worth
bluff
had
won
the
railroad
man
said
again
solemnly
jeff
you
are
a
wonder
with
the
passing
of
his
nearly
completed
railroad
into
the
hands
of
the
jefferson
worth
began
at
once
to
arrange
for
the
building
of
the
other
line
from
barba
to
kingston
this
new
road
to
be
known
as
the
king
basin
central
connecting
with
what
was
now
the
would
give
an
outlet
to
the
rich
south
central
district
while
the
southwestern
and
continental
company
announced
that
its
new
branch
would
not
stop
at
kingston
but
would
build
on
south
to
frontera
with
a
main
line
branch
of
a
railroad
building
straight
through
the
heart
of
the
new
country
and
their
town
located
just
half
way
between
the
junction
and
the
terminal
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
saw
the
value
of
their
property
increased
many
times
the
day
was
not
far
distant
now
when
every
quarter
section
of
the
desert
land
would
be
filed
on
by
eager
settlers
and
the
once
barren
waste
would
rapidly
give
place
to
the
fertile
fields
of
the
ranchers
every
foot
of
which
should
yield
tribute
to
james
greenfield
and
his
associates
but
the
reclamation
of
the
desert
opened
many
avenues
for
profit
other
than
the
irrigation
system
from
these
also
the
company
obeying
the
law
of
good
business
had
planned
to
take
toll
but
the
field
for
investment
most
closely
allied
with
the
fields
of
the
ranchers
and
therefore
keeping
even
pace
with
the
increasing
wealth
of
the
new
country
had
been
preempted
by
jefferson
worth
the
company
desired
to
add
to
their
holdings
those
enterprises
that
had
come
to
be
known
as
the
worth
interests
they
had
failed
repeatedly
to
bring
about
a
union
of
forces
their
only
recourse
then
was
to
force
the
independent
operator
to
sell
to
them
or
to
eliminate
him
from
the
king
basin
project
to
this
end
greenfield
and
burk
watched
and
planned
on
the
well
known
principle
that
whatever
jefferson
worth
wanted
was
bad
for
the
company
until
the
day
when
the
interests
of
worth
and
those
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
should
be
the
same
or
jefferson
worth
should
be
no
longer
a
factor
in
the
new
country
while
the
worth
enterprises
were
firmly
established
in
all
the
centers
of
activity
in
the
basin
the
company
knew
that
his
largest
interests
were
in
barba
and
the
south
central
district
worth
must
have
railroad
connections
with
the
line
before
he
could
even
begin
to
realize
on
his
largest
investments
there
was
every
reason
why
he
should
desire
to
make
kingston
the
junction
point
of
the
road
he
was
now
forced
to
build
james
greenfield
was
not
backward
in
letting
worth
understand
that
he
would
need
to
pay
well
for
a
with
terminal
facilities
in
the
company
town
for
two
weeks
jefferson
worth
tried
to
bring
the
company
president
to
some
reasonable
settlement
but
his
efforts
only
served
to
make
greenfield
more
determined
to
exact
royal
tribute
i
tell
you
said
the
president
triumphantly
to
his
manager
he
forced
to
build
that
line
or
go
to
smash
with
his
town
and
district
no
one
will
settle
away
off
there
from
the
railroad
as
long
as
they
can
locate
in
reach
of
kingston
or
frontera
and
he
has
got
to
connect
with
the
branch
at
kingston
for
we
are
the
only
place
between
the
main
line
and
the
terminal
when
worth
reminded
them
that
the
proposed
road
would
benefit
kingston
and
that
in
view
of
its
value
to
their
town
it
would
be
only
just
for
them
to
give
him
the
privileges
he
needed
but
for
which
he
was
quite
ready
to
pay
a
reasonable
price
greenfield
declared
that
his
company
had
already
given
worth
quite
enough
of
course
if
they
could
find
some
basis
upon
which
to
unite
their
interests
that
would
be
another
matter
then
the
evening
mail
brought
to
worth
certain
legal
looking
papers
and
the
next
morning
he
called
again
upon
greenfield
in
a
spring
wagon
in
front
of
the
company
office
texas
joe
and
abe
lee
waited
with
a
prosperous
looking
stranger
who
also
had
arrived
the
evening
before
greenfield
i
have
come
for
your
final
answer
on
this
railroad
deal
on
greenfield
face
there
was
a
smile
of
satisfaction
and
triumph
there
were
several
reasons
why
he
enjoyed
seeing
jefferson
worth
in
a
corner
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
any
other
proposition
you
have
to
make
mr
worth
you
have
the
only
proposition
i
shall
make
really
i
fear
that
we
can
do
nothing
this
morning
the
visitor
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
office
later
in
describing
the
interview
to
willard
holmes
burk
commented
thoughtfully
i
very
much
fear
your
festive
uncle
jim
played
the
game
a
little
too
fine
you
can
take
some
things
and
most
men
for
granted
but
a
railroad
now
and
jefferson
worth
he
shifted
his
cigar
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
cocked
his
head
in
the
opposite
direction
i
think
willard
that
something
is
going
to
happen
what
happened
was
this
when
jefferson
worth
left
the
company
office
he
stepped
into
the
waiting
rig
beside
the
stranger
go
ahead
abe
he
said
then
the
surveyor
giving
texas
the
direction
the
team
sped
away
once
in
the
desert
they
stopped
occasionally
while
the
surveyor
examined
the
four
by
four
redwood
stakes
at
a
point
on
the
four
miles
north
of
kingston
and
therefore
between
the
company
town
and
the
main
line
abe
directed
texas
to
stop
the
surveyor
taking
a
note
book
from
his
pocket
went
to
a
corner
stake
and
indicated
with
outstretched
hands
the
direction
of
the
boundary
lines
of
a
tract
of
land
owned
by
his
employer
here
we
are
mr
worth
the
place
was
raw
desert
and
except
for
the
railroad
without
sign
of
life
save
the
life
of
the
hard
desolate
land
though
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
improved
ranches
with
kingston
in
their
midst
standing
on
the
slight
elevation
of
the
railroad
grade
jefferson
worth
looked
around
silently
then
followed
by
the
stranger
and
abe
he
walked
some
distance
west
of
the
track
pausing
and
striking
his
into
the
soft
earth
he
said
with
much
less
show
of
emotion
than
is
exhibited
by
the
average
school
boy
in
laying
out
a
we
will
build
a
hotel
here
over
there
a
bank
the
main
street
will
run
toward
the
railroad
the
basin
central
from
barba
will
come
in
from
the
southeast
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
republic
the
town
that
was
built
on
a
barren
desert
almost
in
the
time
it
would
have
taken
to
prepare
the
land
plant
and
grow
a
crop
of
corn
the
stranger
was
the
president
of
a
townsite
company
organized
by
jefferson
worth
while
james
greenfield
was
congratulating
himself
that
he
at
last
had
that
gentleman
in
a
trap
worth
had
given
the
company
the
land
and
had
entered
into
an
agreement
whereby
he
was
to
build
a
hotel
and
several
business
blocks
and
furnish
them
rent
free
for
one
year
with
the
railroad
to
deliver
material
in
any
desired
quantity
work
was
begun
in
a
few
days
the
king
basin
messenger
and
the
papers
in
frontera
and
barba
all
owned
by
worth
gave
full
accounts
of
the
birth
of
the
new
town
and
the
reason
why
the
king
basin
central
would
not
be
built
into
kingston
with
glowing
accounts
of
worth
plans
for
the
future
of
the
company
rival
town
the
worth
electric
company
moved
its
plant
from
kingston
to
republic
the
the
bank
the
telephone
office
and
every
enterprise
controlled
by
worth
followed
while
many
merchants
lured
by
the
success
of
the
wizard
of
the
desert
in
every
undertaking
and
by
the
promise
of
rent
free
went
with
the
worth
industries
and
from
the
world
outside
many
who
had
hesitated
to
enter
the
new
country
before
the
railroad
rushed
in
to
locate
in
the
new
town
the
first
building
completed
in
republic
was
a
cottage
for
barbara
and
her
father
meanwhile
the
work
on
the
road
to
barba
and
the
south
central
district
was
begun
the
something
prophesied
by
burk
had
happened
chapter
xxiv
jefferson
worth
goes
for
help
the
winter
following
the
birth
of
republic
witnessed
the
greatest
activities
that
had
been
seen
in
the
new
country
the
wagons
that
had
once
seemed
so
pitifully
inadequate
as
they
crept
feebly
away
into
the
mysterious
silences
were
replaced
now
by
long
trains
heavily
loaded
with
building
material
and
goods
of
every
kind
and
drawn
by
laboring
engines
that
puffed
and
roared
and
clanged
and
screamed
their
stirring
answer
to
the
challenge
of
the
silent
desolate
land
and
still
the
work
that
had
been
done
was
small
in
comparison
with
that
which
was
yet
to
do
before
the
reclamation
of
barbara
desert
would
be
complete
the
acres
of
land
untouched
by
grader
fresno
or
rancher
plow
were
many
more
than
the
acres
that
were
producing
crops
the
miles
of
canals
and
ditches
that
were
to
be
built
were
many
more
than
the
miles
already
carrying
water
the
tent
houses
and
shacks
of
the
pioneers
were
yet
to
be
replaced
by
more
comfortable
homes
the
frontier
towns
big
in
that
new
country
were
yet
to
grow
into
cities
from
the
top
of
any
building
in
any
one
of
the
four
towns
one
could
look
into
the
barren
desert
tourists
on
the
main
line
that
skirted
the
rim
of
the
basin
from
the
car
windows
saw
only
the
mighty
reaches
of
the
dun
plain
with
its
thirsty
vegetation
stretching
away
to
the
distant
purple
mountain
wall
curiously
the
overland
passengers
looked
at
the
crowds
of
settlers
waiting
for
the
basin
train
at
the
junction
wondering
at
their
hardihood
curiously
they
followed
with
their
eyes
the
thin
line
of
rails
and
telegraph
poles
leading
southward
until
it
was
lost
in
the
mystic
depths
of
color
to
the
tourists
it
was
a
fantastic
dream
that
out
there
somewhere
in
the
barren
waste
people
were
building
towns
cultivating
fields
transacting
business
and
engaging
in
all
the
good
business
activities
of
the
race
it
was
as
impossible
to
them
as
it
had
been
to
willard
holmes
when
barbara
first
introduced
him
to
her
desert
and
tried
to
make
him
see
as
she
saw
the
greatness
of
the
work
of
which
he
was
to
become
a
part
the
latter
part
of
that
winter
found
jefferson
worth
again
with
his
back
to
the
wall
james
greenfield
in
his
attempt
to
hold
up
his
rival
in
the
matter
of
the
king
basin
central
junction
had
wrought
better
than
he
knew
while
worth
enterprises
were
barely
as
yet
paying
their
way
the
railroad
which
he
was
forced
to
build
in
order
to
protect
his
own
interests
in
the
town
of
barba
and
in
the
south
central
district
would
require
practically
all
he
had
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
other
line
that
had
so
nearly
exhausted
his
resources
the
company
president
in
forcing
him
to
build
the
town
of
republic
in
addition
to
his
heavy
outlay
on
his
new
railroad
forced
him
to
take
another
desperate
chance
for
the
first
time
he
was
unable
to
pay
the
men
and
in
thirty
days
large
obligations
for
material
would
be
due
while
certain
rumors
carefully
started
by
greenfield
made
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
raise
the
funds
he
must
have
i
sorry
jeff
said
his
friend
the
railroad
man
but
with
present
unsafe
conditions
we
ca
load
up
with
any
more
property
in
the
basin
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
if
the
river
comes
in
we
will
have
to
get
in
there
to
protect
our
interests
for
if
those
ranchers
were
wiped
out
our
road
would
sell
for
scrap
iron
you
could
do
it
and
the
greenfield
crowd
would
why
that
new
york
bunch
outside
of
greenfield
do
know
whether
the
colorado
is
a
trout
stream
or
a
mill
pond
their
actual
investment
does
amount
to
half
what
you
have
put
into
your
work
for
the
sale
of
water
rights
to
the
settlers
is
paying
all
the
expense
of
their
extensions
and
they
wo
put
up
a
cent
to
rebuild
their
shaky
old
structures
and
look
where
we
stand
we
have
put
more
money
into
that
country
now
than
the
company
and
you
together
and
we
wo
pay
operating
expenses
until
the
land
is
developed
and
still
the
public
is
roaring
about
our
rates
we
do
want
another
desert
line
on
our
hands
quietly
jefferson
worth
sold
his
interest
in
the
banks
in
frontera
barba
and
republic
and
as
quietly
greenfield
who
was
watching
set
about
gaining
control
of
these
institutions
his
south
central
district
water
stock
was
already
sold
and
most
of
his
property
in
barba
even
his
little
home
in
republic
was
mortgaged
thus
worth
held
on
for
a
while
longer
he
dared
not
stop
his
work
for
such
a
move
would
not
only
ruin
his
chances
of
negotiating
the
loans
he
needed
but
by
bringing
upon
him
a
swarm
of
creditors
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
ever
to
recover
his
standing
in
the
financial
world
another
pay
day
passed
without
the
men
receiving
their
pay
and
the
third
was
drawing
near
already
there
was
grumbling
and
complaining
among
the
men
over
the
delayed
pay
checks
it
would
take
but
little
more
to
start
serious
trouble
there
were
many
in
the
crowd
at
the
depot
that
day
when
jefferson
worth
waited
for
the
train
to
the
city
who
looked
with
envy
upon
the
builder
of
towns
and
railroads
horace
blanton
proudly
pointed
out
to
a
stranger
his
friend
the
wizard
of
the
desert
with
the
information
that
worth
had
cleaned
up
a
cool
million
in
the
new
country
several
went
out
of
their
way
for
a
closer
look
at
him
or
for
a
possible
greeting
others
cursed
him
roundly
under
their
breath
for
a
hated
member
of
the
class
of
parasites
that
live
on
the
industry
of
the
laborer
a
financier
who
robbed
the
people
a
capitalist
who
produced
nothing
the
train
pulled
in
and
worth
with
a
to
barbara
and
abe
who
had
come
to
see
him
off
stepped
aboard
no
one
save
abe
lee
not
even
barbara
knew
that
her
father
must
raise
fifty
thousand
dollars
before
the
first
of
the
month
or
suffer
financial
ruin
and
no
one
not
even
jefferson
worth
himself
knew
where
he
could
find
the
money
barbara
when
her
father
was
gone
though
she
knew
nothing
of
the
danger
that
threatened
him
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
beset
by
vague
and
nameless
doubts
and
fears
the
little
desert
town
with
its
bustling
activity
its
clamorous
rushing
disorder
its
naked
newness
and
glaring
bareness
offended
her
nothing
was
completed
the
streets
the
buildings
the
very
people
seemed
so
unsettled
so
temporary
she
could
not
shake
off
the
feeling
that
it
would
all
vanish
soon
as
she
had
often
seen
the
phantom
cities
of
the
desert
plain
melt
and
disappear
the
morning
after
her
father
left
as
she
rode
el
capitan
slowly
along
the
little
village
streets
that
lay
so
dusty
and
flat
and
that
ended
so
quickly
in
the
open
country
she
caught
herself
wondering
how
long
the
dream
would
endure
the
farms
too
with
their
new
green
fields
and
their
primitive
pioneer
shacks
tent
houses
and
shelters
and
their
acres
of
still
unimproved
land
all
lying
under
the
white
blaze
of
the
sun
were
they
more
than
a
mirage
weirdly
painted
in
the
air
by
the
spirit
of
the
dreadful
land
to
lure
foolish
men
to
their
ruin
near
the
crossing
of
a
canal
she
saw
a
zanjero
turning
the
water
through
a
new
delivery
gate
into
a
new
ditch
and
checking
el
capitan
she
watched
the
brown
flood
rolling
down
the
channel
prepared
for
it
and
heard
the
dry
earth
hiss
and
purr
as
it
sucked
up
the
moisture
with
the
thirst
of
a
thousand
years
she
wanted
to
cry
out
a
protest
the
effort
was
so
pitifully
foolish
this
awful
awful
land
would
never
yield
to
the
men
who
sought
to
subdue
it
with
such
feeble
means
from
the
little
stream
of
water
no
deeper
than
would
reach
to
el
knees
and
no
wider
than
his
stride
she
looked
away
and
around
over
the
seemingly
endless
miles
of
barren
waste
the
man
at
the
delivery
gate
recorded
the
number
of
inches
in
his
book
and
with
a
greeting
to
the
young
woman
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
along
the
canal
barbara
moving
on
left
the
farms
behind
and
rode
into
the
barren
waste
this
at
least
was
real
this
in
its
very
desolation
its
dreadful
silence
its
still
menace
was
satisfying
but
as
on
that
morning
when
she
first
rode
el
capitan
into
the
desert
from
kingston
she
grew
afraid
the
dreadful
spirit
of
the
land
so
pressed
upon
her
that
she
turned
her
horse
and
fled
as
one
might
fly
from
an
approaching
storm
another
restless
unsatisfying
day
and
a
lonely
evening
dragged
by
texas
and
pat
she
had
not
seen
for
a
week
even
abe
had
not
been
near
her
since
her
father
left
she
told
herself
she
would
find
them
at
their
work
and
demand
a
reason
for
their
neglect
the
next
morning
she
set
out
on
el
capitan
to
follow
the
line
of
her
father
railroad
until
she
should
find
her
neglectful
as
she
rode
along
the
she
watched
the
hundreds
of
mexican
and
indian
laborers
at
their
work
on
the
grade
and
thought
of
the
men
who
had
built
the
south
central
canal
those
men
too
had
labored
for
her
father
but
they
worked
also
for
themselves
the
canal
they
built
was
to
reclaim
their
own
land
and
to
make
for
them
farms
and
homes
these
poor
fellows
on
the
railroad
she
reflected
had
no
share
in
that
which
they
were
doing
there
was
in
their
toil
nothing
but
the
day
wage
she
could
not
feel
as
she
had
felt
in
the
south
central
district
that
she
had
a
part
with
them
in
their
work
here
and
there
she
recognized
a
mexican
from
rubio
city
and
these
returned
her
greeting
pleasantly
for
they
remembered
the
young
woman
kindness
to
the
poor
but
by
far
the
greater
number
gave
her
only
sullen
glances
she
was
to
them
only
the
daughter
of
the
man
for
whom
they
toiled
and
who
had
not
paid
passing
from
gang
to
gang
and
camp
to
camp
watching
the
dark
faces
of
the
laborers
listening
to
their
sullen
undertone
the
young
woman
felt
the
restless
threatening
spirit
of
the
little
army
as
one
may
feel
sometimes
the
heavily
charged
atmosphere
before
an
electric
storm
but
she
did
not
understand
she
had
never
before
ridden
over
the
railroad
work
alone
as
she
had
so
often
done
in
the
south
central
district
she
grew
a
little
frightened
at
last
at
the
scowling
looks
and
muttered
remarks
that
followed
her
as
she
went
and
she
was
wishing
that
she
had
not
come
when
she
saw
just
ahead
abe
lee
and
pat
the
surveyor
was
giving
some
instructions
to
the
irish
boss
and
both
were
so
intent
that
they
did
not
see
barbara
approaching
as
the
young
woman
drew
quite
near
a
mexican
who
in
watching
her
approach
either
forgot
the
presence
of
his
superiors
or
in
sheer
ruffianly
bravado
ignored
them
uttered
a
coarse
remark
to
his
companions
about
his
daughter
the
young
woman
heard
and
turned
pale
as
death
pat
heard
and
turning
quickly
around
caught
sight
of
barbara
and
saw
the
ruffian
who
had
spoken
looking
at
her
with
a
roar
the
irishman
leaped
forward
and
with
a
blow
of
his
huge
hairy
fist
dropped
the
mexican
a
senseless
heap
in
the
dirt
with
cries
of
rage
the
fellow
countrymen
ran
toward
the
white
man
drawing
their
knives
as
they
came
barbara
sat
leaning
forward
in
her
saddle
breathless
abe
lee
was
quietly
rolling
a
cigarette
pat
stood
motionless
his
features
set
and
his
eyes
shining
like
points
of
light
within
ten
steps
of
their
boss
the
little
mob
stopped
then
the
irishman
spoke
in
a
voice
that
rumbled
and
shook
with
menacing
rage
ye
manuel
an
pedro
drag
that
carrion
off
the
an
tell
him
when
he
wakes
up
av
he
values

life

av
ye
hombres

the
hell
out
av
here
the
two
whom
he
called
by
name
did
his
bidding
and
the
rest
scattered
like
sheep
pat
turned
to
barbara
is
sorry
i
am
that
ye
should
see
ut
me
girl
but
ut
had
to
be
done
oh
pat
did
you
is
he
she
could
not
speak
the
word
but
followed
with
frightened
eyes
the
still
form
of
the
unconscious
man
as
his
companions
him
to
the
shade
of
a
mesquite
tree
there
there
do
worry
said
her
big
friend
soothingly
he
not
as
much
hurted
as
he
should
be
he
have
a
bit
av
a
bump
on
his
noodle
that
maybe
make
him
a
bit
careful
wid
his
foul
tongue
for
a
while
that
all
barbara
looked
down
into
the
face
of
the
old
gladiator
whose
eyes
as
they
looked
up
at
her
were
soft
as
a
childs
oh
pat
are
you
sure
he
he
crumpled
up
so
it
was
awful
she
shuddered
there
there
av
course
i
sure
do
i
know
look
at
him
sittin
up
now
he
be
on
his
fate
in
a
minute
sure
enough
as
barbara
looked
again
she
saw
the
mexican
rising
to
a
sitting
posture
and
with
his
hand
to
his
head
look
around
in
a
dazed
manner
as
though
awakening
out
of
a
deep
sleep
the
young
woman
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
with
a
faint
smile
said
to
the
surveyor
who
had
drawn
nearer
i
sorry
i
came
abe
i
afraid
you
think
that
i
only
in
the
way
to
make
trouble
but
i
was
so
lonesome
all
alone
at
home
why
barbara
you
know
how
glad
we
always
are
to
see
you
you
must
not
mind
this
little
incident
it
all
in
the
day
work
with
pat
you
see
that
fellow
there
has
had
this
coming
to
him
for
some
time
the
irishman
grinned
and
the
young
woman
on
the
horse
with
a
little
laugh
said
all
the
same
i
do
think
i
would
like
you
for
a
boss
uncle
pat
you
too
too
emphatic
and
the
big
irishman
with
twinkling
eyes
retorted
sure
av
ye
was
boss
av
a
gang
ye
wud
break
more
hearts
wid
yer
swate
face
than
i
could
heads
wid
me
two
hands
which
retort
effectually
closed
the
incident
when
the
three
had
chatted
a
while
and
barbara
had
scolded
them
for
not
coming
to
see
her
abe
said
i
think
you
had
better
go
back
now
barbara
but
do
follow
the
line
strike
west
over
the
desert
until
you
come
to
the
road
and
go
in
that
way
we
ca
leave
now
to
go
with
you
and
some
of
these
greasers
might
get
gay
again
i
see
you
this
evening
it
was
after
nine
that
night
when
the
surveyor
finally
reached
the
worth
cottage
somewhat
awkwardly
he
entered
and
seated
himself
in
the
nearest
chair
while
barbara
returning
to
her
favorite
rocker
by
the
table
said
it
time
you
came
i
was
so
lonely
i
do
believe
i
could
have
stood
it
another
hour
really
you
and
pat
and
tex
have
neglected
me
shamefully
you
have
been
near
since
the
day
father
left
even
pablo
has
forgotten
me
pablo
is
at
the
power
house
at
dry
river
abe
said
slowly
we
all
had
our
hands
full
for
the
last
three
days
i
reckon
you
know
we
have
not
stayed
away
because
we
wanted
to
something
in
the
man
tone
and
manner
caused
barbara
to
look
at
him
closely
was
it
a
fancy
in
keeping
with
her
gloomy
spirit
of
the
last
few
days
or
did
the
surveyor
tall
form
droop
as
if
with
discouragement
he
was
not
looking
at
her
with
his
usual
straightforward
manner
he
seemed
to
be
studying
the
pattern
of
the
navajo
rug
that
lay
between
them
and
certainly
his
lean
bronzed
face
wore
a
careworn
look
that
was
new
she
noticed
too
that
he
wore
belt
and
revolver
which
was
very
unusual
for
abe
of
course
i
know
she
exclaimed
it
was
childish
of
me
to
complain
forgive
me
abe
without
answering
looked
at
her
a
straight
questioning
challenging
look
that
for
some
reason
brought
another
flush
to
her
cheek
then
the
surveyor
turned
his
gaze
again
upon
the
navajo
rug
i
know
you
are
tired
said
the
young
woman
again
you
have
so
much
to
think
about
with
all
those
men
to
look
after
and
daddy
away
come
now
you
sit
right
over
here
in
this
easy
chair
and
shut
your
eyes
and
smoke
and
forget
all
about
the
work
and
everything
while
i
make
a
little
music
for
you
barbara
did
not
realize
how
she
tried
this
man
of
the
desert
with
a
glimpse
of
a
heaven
that
abe
knew
could
never
be
for
him
for
a
moment
he
sat
motionless
without
answering
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
floor
then
with
a
quick
resolute
movement
he
threw
up
his
head
and
straightened
himself
i
sorry
barbara
but
i
ca
stay
this
evening
ca
stay
she
cried
why
abe
you
just
came
yes
i
know
i
i
just
ran
in
to
ask
you
to
see
if
you
he
hesitated
and
stammered
then
finished
desperately
to
ask
you
to
let
me
send
texas
to
stay
here
she
looked
at
him
in
bewildered
amazement
why
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
why
should
texas
stay
here
then
as
a
sudden
possible
explanation
came
to
her
mind
abe
has
uncle
tex
is
he
in
trouble
the
surveyor
smiled
at
her
words
it
nothing
like
that
barbara
tex
is
all
right
but
i
do
think
that
you
should
be
left
alone
here
with
only
ynez
just
now
pat
is
at
the
power
house
and
i
must
be
at
the
ice
plant
and
tex
he
checked
himself
in
alarm
barbara
face
was
white
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
were
big
with
sudden
fear
as
rising
slowly
to
her
feet
she
went
towards
him
with
an
exclamation
he
sprang
from
his
seat
but
she
regained
control
of
herself
and
quietly
taking
another
chair
nearer
him
said
i
think
you
had
better
tell
me
abe
just
exactly
what
the
trouble
is
i
know
something
is
wrong
or
you
would
not
want
to
send
texas
here
to
me
you
know
that
i
have
always
stayed
with
ynez
why
are
you
afraid
for
me
why
is
pat
at
the
power
house
and
why
are
you
going
to
stay
at
the
ice
plant
and
why
do
you
wear
that
she
pointed
to
the
heavy
revolver
little
by
little
she
forced
from
the
reluctant
superintendent
an
explanation
of
the
whole
situation
how
her
father
had
been
driven
by
the
company
to
build
the
new
town
of
republic
in
addition
to
the
construction
of
his
railroad
to
barba
and
how
conditions
in
the
basin
had
made
it
impossible
to
sell
this
line
to
the
as
he
had
sold
before
he
told
her
as
gently
as
he
could
that
the
men
had
not
been
paid
for
nearly
two
months
and
that
if
her
father
did
not
succeed
in
raising
the
necessary
funds
quickly
he
would
lose
everything
the
men
had
been
put
off
from
day
to
day
with
explanations
that
their
employer
was
away
and
that
they
would
receive
their
pay
when
he
returned
but
ugly
rumors
were
afloat
among
them
and
their
angry
uneasiness
and
discontent
were
increasing
threats
against
their
employer
and
his
property
were
being
made
by
the
leaders
who
always
appear
under
such
conditions
and
the
surveyor
feared
that
serious
trouble
might
start
at
any
hour
to
barbara
the
situation
was
almost
incredible
again
and
again
she
exclaimed
with
pity
for
her
father
and
demanded
to
know
why
they
had
all
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
and
as
she
realized
how
lovingly
she
had
been
shielded
from
every
worry
that
she
might
feel
nothing
of
the
burden
that
weighed
so
heavily
upon
them
her
woman
heart
cried
out
that
she
had
not
been
permitted
to
bear
her
share
but
i
know
now
she
said
at
last
brushing
aside
the
tears
that
against
her
will
filled
the
brown
eyes
i
know
now
and
you
men
shall
see
that
i
can
do
something
to
help
she
stood
before
him
her
strong
beautiful
figure
bravely
erect
her
face
glowing
with
the
light
of
a
determined
purpose
the
surveyor
smiled
his
appreciation
as
he
said
it
almost
as
good
as
money
in
the
bank
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
barbara
but
let
me
send
tex
over
wo
you
you
must
do
whatever
you
think
best
abe
but
you
must
promise
me
this
from
now
on
you
will
tell
me
everything
just
as
you
have
always
told
me
about
the
work
abe
drew
a
long
breath
i
do
know
what
your
father
will
say
but
i
do
it
i
felt
all
along
that
it
was
hardly
square
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
of
course
it
was
she
agreed
and
now
listen
you
and
pat
come
here
for
breakfast
with
texas
joe
and
me
come
as
early
as
you
like
he
began
to
protest
saying
that
they
would
need
to
eat
at
daybreak
in
order
to
get
back
to
the
work
by
seven
but
she
silenced
him
with
and
do
you
think
that
i
can
not
even
get
up
at
you
shall
not
lose
a
minute
time
and
it
will
do
you
good
to
start
out
with
one
of
ynez
good
breakfasts
so
the
surveyor
was
forced
to
promise
this
also
then
with
a
soft
buenos
noches
senorita
he
left
her
later
texas
joe
came
to
sleep
in
worth
room
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
when
the
first
trace
of
silver
gray
light
shone
above
the
eastern
mesa
beyond
the
rim
of
the
basin
abe
lee
returned
with
pat
to
find
the
meal
ready
and
barbara
waiting
to
pour
the
fragrant
coffee
while
the
sky
was
still
aflame
with
the
colors
of
the
morning
and
the
desert
lay
under
a
curtain
of
fantastic
figures
and
grotesque
patterns
woven
by
the
light
the
three
men
mounted
their
horses
and
set
out
for
the
field
of
the
day
labors
and
barbara
at
the
gate
watched
them
go
until
in
the
distance
their
forms
too
were
caught
in
the
magic
of
the
desert
loom
and
woven
into
the
airy
design
before
noon
abe
came
back
the
men
had
struck
the
surveyor
had
already
sent
a
telegram
to
worth
and
in
the
afternoon
they
had
his
answer
that
he
was
going
to
san
felipe
but
there
was
no
word
of
hope
in
the
message
all
that
day
the
men
from
the
railroad
were
gathering
in
the
little
town
and
in
the
early
evening
the
laborers
from
the
power
canal
at
barba
joined
the
throng
on
the
streets
this
scowling
crowd
of
mexicans
and
indians
was
very
different
from
the
company
of
pioneers
that
met
in
kingston
to
receive
jefferson
worth
a
few
months
before
on
every
hand
they
were
heard
cursing
the
man
who
owed
them
their
wages
and
threatening
to
take
revenge
if
they
were
not
soon
paid
that
night
texas
joe
again
slept
at
the
worth
cottage
for
barbara
stoutly
refused
to
leave
her
home
and
abe
and
pat
with
the
little
handful
of
white
men
from
the
office
force
stood
guard
at
the
power
house
the
ice
plant
and
the
other
buildings
that
were
grouped
near
the
railroad
on
the
edge
of
town
chapter
xxv
willard
holmes
on
trial
scarcely
had
the
train
with
jefferson
worth
aboard
passed
beyond
the
yard
limits
of
republic
when
the
manager
of
the
king

and
irrigation
company
in
kingston
was
called
to
the
telephone
by
the
cashier
of

ten
minutes
later
a
western
union
message
in

from

to
james

in

the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
willard

the
engineer
at

the
next
morning

escorted

hotel
i
was
almighty
glad

the

about
the
country
so
where
did
he
catch
you
dry
river
heading
my
gadding
takes
me
mostly
there
or
to
the
intake
heading
these
days
just
now
i
am
trying
to
patch
up
the
spillway
which
threatens
to
go
out
at
any
time
altogether
and
the
heading
itself
is
so
shaky
i
almost
afraid
to
touch
it
for
fear
it
will
fall
down
on
top
of
me
no
one
ever
dreamed
that
these
structures
would
ever
be
called
upon
to
stand
the
strain
they
are
under
now
i
wish
all
right
all
right
my
boy
i
think
i
heard
you
say
something
like
that
before
i
called
you
in
to
help
me
on
a
little
deal
that
will
put
us
in
shape
to
build
all
the
new
structures
you
want
you
mean
that
the
company
is
at
last
going
to
make
the
appropriation
i
have
been
begging
for
not
exactly
they
will
if
we
can
handle
one
individual
who
jefferson
worth
jefferson
worth
what
under
heaven
has
he
to
do
with
the
appropriations
he
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
company
profits
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
at
this
holmes
was
silent
and
his
uncle
was
forced
to
continue
you
know
what
worth
has
been
doing
to
the
company
do
you
yes
and
i
know
what
the
company
has
been
trying
to
do
to
him
exactly
and
do
you
know
his
present
situation
only
in
a
general
way
well
in
a
definite
way
then
he
is
here
in
the
city
trying
to
raise
fifty
thousand
dollars
he
must
have
it
before
the
first
of
the
month
or
go
to
smash
if
he
goes
to
smash
the
company
will
be
able
to
get
hold
of
his
interests
which
will
give
us
control
of
the
whole
basin
project
as
we
planned
in
the
beginning
then
we
would
be
able
to
put
what
you
want
into
the
system
if
worth
gets
the
fifty
thousand
he
is
safe
to
make
a
million
or
two
that
would
otherwise
go
to
the
company
and
we
would
feel
justified
in
spending
any
more
money
on
new
structures
but
uncle
jim
what
on
earth
have
i
to
do
with
all
this
it
happens
that
you
have
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
it
my
boy
or
i
would
have
called
you
away
from
your
beloved
headings
you
remember
old
george
cartwright
do
you
willard
holmes
had
grown
to
manhood
with
cartwright
sons
and
his
earliest
memories
were
of
boyish
good
times
at
the
old
home
with
james
greenfield
cartwright
had
been
one
of
his
father
oldest
and
warmest
friends
the
engineer
listened
with
amazed
interest
as
greenfield
told
him
that
his
old
friend
was
spending
the
winter
on
the
coast
and
that
some
one
the
general
manager
of
the
probably
had
introduced
jefferson
worth
to
him
and
greenfield
finished
they
have
him
all
lined
up
to
furnish
worth
with
the
capital
he
needs
to
go
ahead
if
he
gets
that
money
we
will
never
be
able
to
block
him
but
why
do
you
get
cartwright
into
your
crowd
if
he
is
so
ready
to
invest
in
reclamation
projects
asked
the
engineer
i
ca
on
account
of
white
and
some
of
the
others
you
know
how
cranky
the
old
man
is
besides
we
do
want
him
in
the
company
what
we
want
is
to
block
jefferson
worth
from
getting
hold
of
that
money
i
sent
for
you
because
you
can
do
more
with
cartwright
on
this
proposition
than
any
man
living
you
mean
that
you
have
sent
for
me
to
influence
cartwright
against
jefferson
worth
interests
i
mean
that
i
expect
you
to
use
your
influence
in
the
interests
of
the
company
in
my
interests
surely
willard
that
is
not
asking
anything
unreasonable
but
uncle
jim
you
just
said
that
if
worth
gets
this
help
he
will
clean
up
a
million
or
two
that
looks
like
it
would
be
safe
enough
for
mr
cartwright
yes
and
i
said
also
that
if
worth
did
get
that
money
the
company
would
acquire
his
interests
in
the
king
basin
while
the
company
president
was
speaking
a
messenger
boy
knocked
at
the
door
greenfield
read
the
note
and
handed
it
to
holmes
who
in
turn
read
cartwright
left
this
afternoon
for
san
felipe
will
probably
return
in
a
week
worth
is
still
in
town
that
means
you
must
take
a
little
vacation
willard
but
i
ca
uncle
jim
protested
the
engineer
my
work
is
in
such
shape
that
i
the
older
man
interrupted
your
work
you
seem
to
think
that
there
is
nothing
of
importance
to
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
but
drops
and
headings
and
intakes
and
canals
and
the
lord
knows
what
else
you
mess
around
with
if
you
handle
old
cartwright
in
the
interests
of
the
company
it
will
be
the
best
week
work
you
ever
did
he
is
likely
to
return
any
day
and
you
got
to
stay
right
here
and
see
this
matter
through
all
that
day
the
engineer
roamed
about
the
city
striving
to
find
distraction
in
the
amusements
offered
but
feeling
strangely
alone
and
out
of
place
under
other
circumstances
he
would
have
keenly
enjoyed
the
brief
vacation
and
the
change
from
the
desert
life
and
work
but
now
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
situation
in
which
he
so
unexpectedly
found
himself
once
he
would
not
have
hesitated
an
instant
to
do
greenfield
bidding
why
should
he
hesitate
now
why
indeed
save
for
this
willard
holmes
knew
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
people
in
the
new
country
if
jefferson
worth
continued
his
operations
willard
holmes
conception
and
understanding
of
his
work
as
an
engineer
had
changed
materially
in
the
years
since
those
first
days
with
barbara
in
rubio
city
even
as
under
his
hand
the
desert
itself
had
changed
it
may
have
been
that
in
his
long
lonely
rides
across
the
great
plain
in
the
white
light
of
the
wide
cloudless
sky
something
of
the
spirit
of
the
slow
silent
ages
that
had
wrought
in
the
making
of
the
desert
had
touched
his
spirit
as
it
could
not
have
been
influenced
by
the
atmosphere
and
crowded
highways
of
the
east
or
that
in
the
lonely
nights
under
the
stars
the
weird
mysterious
voices
of
the
desert
had
taught
him
truths
he
had
never
heard
in
the
noisy
cries
of
the
great
cities
perhaps
as
he
had
looked
day
after
day
across
the
wide
miles
with
their
seas
and
scarfs
and
veils
of
color
to
the
purple
mountains
the
very
greatness
of
the
unpeopled
lands
forced
him
to
a
larger
thinking
and
planning
and
dreaming
than
would
have
been
possible
in
the
limited
views
of
his
eastern
homeland
or
that
the
spirit
of
the
hardy
settlers
awoke
the
blood
of
his
own
pioneer
ancestors
to
a
feeling
of
fellowship
or
his
constant
struggle
with
the
river
aroused
the
old
conquering
spirit
of
his
race
or
again
it
might
be
that
some
powerful
chord
and
silent
in
his
nature
had
been
touched
by
the
spirit
of
the
girl
who
had
bidden
him
learn
the
language
of
her
country
and
who
had
said
that
she
could
never
forgive
one
who
was
untrue
to
the
work
itself
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
training
of
his
whole
professional
career
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
king
basin
work
the
engineer
had
known
no
other
creed
than
the
creed
of
those
corporation
servants
who
have
no
higher
interest
than
that
of
the
machine
they
serve
there
was
also
his
intimate
relation
with
greenfield
and
the
debt
of
gratitude
he
owed
the
man
who
had
in
every
way
been
a
father
to
him
and
there
was
the
prejudice
of
class
the
instinct
that
holds
a
man
to
his
own
peculiar
people
and
the
argument
cleverly
advanced
by
greenfield
that
the
protection
of
the
king
basin
project
would
be
secured
as
the
engineer
was
wandering
in
the
aimless
and
preoccupied
manner
of
one
whose
mind
is
not
on
his
task
through
one
of
the
city
parks
he
saw
just
ahead
a
man
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
with
aroused
interest
he
quickened
his
pace
there
was
no
mistaking
that
form
so
strongly
upright
so
instinct
with
vigorous
power
nor
those
broad
shoulders
and
the
finely
poised
head
it
was
the
seer
overtaking
the
older
engineer
holmes
greeted
him
eagerly
and
the
brown
eyes
of
the
old
chief
shone
with
pleasure
while
he
returned
the
young
man
greeting
heartily
had
the
seer
any
engagement
that
afternoon
none
at
all
he
had
just
arrived
from
the
north
country
and
was
loafing
a
day
or
two
and
holmes
the
younger
man
laughed
he
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
forced
by
circumstances
to
do
nothing
good
they
would
find
a
quiet
corner
somewhere
and
holmes
could
tell
his
old
chief
about
the
king
basin
work
also
the
king
basin
man
could
tell
the
seer
about
barbara
so
they
found
a
seat
and
willard
holmes
told
how
splendidly
the
dream
was
coming
true
and
in
answer
to
many
questions
talked
of
barbara
and
her
life
in
the
new
country
of
jefferson
worth
and
his
operations
and
of
some
of
his
own
professional
difficulties
and
problems
and
the
seer
as
he
led
the
younger
man
on
and
studied
the
strong
bronzed
face
that
was
all
aglow
with
enthusiasm
over
the
work
smiled
quietly
as
he
remembered
the
tenderfoot
who
had
once
threatened
to
report
his
chief
to
the
company
brave
generous
seer
there
was
in
all
his
questioning
not
a
hint
of
any
feeling
against
the
younger
man
who
had
been
given
the
place
that
should
have
been
his
he
fell
to
wondering
if
after
all
the
company
had
now
in
holmes
the
man
they
thought
they
had
or
the
man
they
did
have
indeed
when
they
made
him
their
chief
engineer
if
the
test
were
to
come
now
the
seer
did
not
know
that
willard
holmes
was
even
then
undergoing
that
test
the
two
men
dined
together
that
evening
and
afterwards
over
the
cigars
in
the
seer
room
the
old
engineer
talked
of
the
progress
and
future
of
the
great
reclamation
work
of
its
value
not
only
to
our
own
nation
but
to
the
nations
beyond
the
seas
and
of
its
place
in
the
great
forward
march
of
the
race
then
gravely
he
spoke
to
the
younger
man
of
his
own
efforts
to
bring
the
work
to
the
attention
of
the
people
of
disappointments
and
failures
year
after
year
until
at
last
the
work
in
barbara
desert
had
been
launched
and
following
that
several
other
projects
until
now
at
last
reclamation
had
become
a
great
national
enterprise
and
willard
holmes
knew
that
out
of
the
millions
that
would
be
realized
from
these
reclaimed
lands
this
man
who
had
seen
the
vision
would
receive
nothing
the
seer
had
not
even
a
position
with
an
irrigation
company
or
with
a
reclamation
project
as
he
listened
to
the
man
who
had
literally
given
the
best
of
his
life
to
a
great
work
the
company
engineer
felt
as
he
sometimes
felt
when
alone
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
itself
he
heard
its
call
the
call
that
was
at
once
a
challenge
a
threat
and
a
promise
or
as
when
he
had
felt
the
sweet
power
of
barbara
presence
at
his
hotel
holmes
found
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
anxiously
awaiting
him
look
here
was
greenfield
greeting
this
thing
is
approaching
a
climax
he
handed
the
engineer
a
telegram
from
burk
willard
holmes
glanced
at
the
yellow
slip
of
paper
strike
on
the
looks
serious
jefferson
worth
left
for
san
felipe
this
afternoon
greenfield
said
quickly
there
another
train
in
thirty
minutes
we
must
miss
it
chapter
xxvi
held
in
suspense
george
cartwright
the
retired
new
york
capitalist
belonged
to
that
older
school
of
american
financiers
who
having
built
up
large
fortunes
by
taking
advantage
of
the
speculative
opportunities
of
their
day
look
somewhat
doubtfully
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
successful
old
age
upon
the
same
adventurous
spirit
when
shown
by
the
active
younger
generation
george
cartwright
was
ready
to
take
a
chance
certainly
he
had
taken
chances
all
his
life
but
george
cartwright
distrusted
mightily
what
he
called
the
system
of
the
modern
manipulators
of
capital
some
day
he
predicted
the
manipulators
themselves
would
go
along
with
their
methods
though
retired
from
the
rush
and
drive
of
active
business
the
veteran
still
enjoyed
taking
an
occasional
hand
in
the
game
though
more
than
ever
he
played
that
hand
with
a
dignified
leisure
befitting
the
stake
a
business
transaction
said
he
was
not
something
to
be
put
through
with
a
nod
and
wink
or
at
most
a
half
dozen
monosyllables
between
as
many
bites
of
a
sandwich
jefferson
worth
was
in
desperate
need
of
quick
action
he
was
not
playing
a
game
of
business
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
playing
he
was
fighting
for
his
financial
life
and
every
hour
delay
increased
his
peril
but
jefferson
worth
did
not
need
his
railroad
friend
warning
that
an
attempt
to
rush
george
cartwright
would
be
disastrous
the
old
financier
was
not
at
all
backward
in
making
known
to
jefferson
worth
his
opinions
of
jim
greenfield
and
the
men
associated
with
him
in
the
company
he
had
had
some
experience
with
them
not
altogether
satisfactory
to
himself
but
an
investment
in
actual
improvement
and
development
enterprises
such
as
he
understood
worth
to
be
promoting
was
rather
an
attractive
venture
he
was
going
for
a
trip
to
san
felipe
and
when
he
returned
he
would
take
the
matter
up
barbara
father
could
not
urge
his
need
of
immediate
relief
for
to
do
so
would
have
been
to
destroy
his
only
hope
so
he
was
forced
to
await
the
new
york
man
pleasure
nor
was
worth
ignorant
of
efforts
as
indicated
by
the
presence
of
willard
holmes
in
the
city
he
knew
also
the
high
regard
that
cartwright
held
for
the
engineer
and
that
he
would
place
great
value
upon
the
company
man
opinion
what
would
willard
holmes
do
abe
lee
telegram
announcing
the
strike
and
the
critical
situation
in
the
basin
changed
conditions
instantly
now
jefferson
worth
only
hope
was
to
get
to
cartwright
without
delay
and
to
present
the
urgent
need
of
immediate
action
for
while
the
chances
that
the
old
capitalist
would
come
to
the
rescue
were
greatly
lessened
jefferson
financial
ruin
was
certain
if
the
critical
situation
at
home
was
not
relieved
instantly
sending
the
telegram
to
abe
lee
he
took
the
first
train
for
san
felipe
it
was
indeed
a
forlorn
hope
worth
train
arrived
in
san
felipe
about
eleven
in
the
morning
scanning
the
register
at
the
principal
hotel
he
found
the
eastern
man
name
but
the
clerk
informed
him
that
cartwright
was
out
for
the
day
with
a
party
of
friends
from
new
york
and
would
not
likely
return
until
late
in
the
evening
no
one
observing
the
quiet
man
who
waited
in
the
hotel
lobby
that
evening
could
have
said
that
there
was
more
on
his
mind
than
a
mild
interest
in
the
evening
paper
yet
jefferson
worth
was
reading
an
account
of
the
king
basin
strike
finishing
the
article
he
dropped
the
paper
on
his
knee
while
the
slim
fingers
of
his
right
hand
sought
his
chin
with
a
nervous
caressing
motion
and
his
expressionless
eyes
moved
continually
over
the
crowd
in
the
big
room
outside
the
depot
had
just
stopped
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
a
company
of
newly
arrived
guests
were
entering
the
corridor
while
the
were
running
forward
to
relieve
them
of
their
luggage
and
lead
them
to
the
clerk
behind
the
register
first
of
the
group
jefferson
worth
saw
the
portly
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
and
with
him
his
athletic
chief
engineer
even
as
the
two
were
talking
with
the
clerk
and
as
worth
rightly
guessed
asking
for
cartwright
the
old
gentleman
with
his
party
of
friends
entered
at
a
word
from
the
man
behind
the
desk
greenfield
and
holmes
turned
to
greet
the
entering
capitalist
and
his
party
they
were
all
new
yorkers
acquaintances
and
friends
coming
together
with
the
width
of
the
continent
between
them
and
their
homes
their
greetings
were
cordial
joyful
even
boisterous
and
as
they
parted
to
follow
the
waiting
to
their
rooms
the
western
pioneer
banker
heard
them
agreeing
to
meet
and
dine
together
a
few
minutes
later
jefferson
worth
realized
that
a
business
interview
with
cartwright
that
evening
was
impossible
without
visible
interest
in
anything
else
he
raised
his
paper
again
and
continued
reading
the
next
morning
when
the
new
york
capitalist
stepped
from
the
elevator
on
his
way
to
breakfast
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
man
who
so
desperately
needed
financial
assistance
why
how
do
you
do
worth
when
did
you
land
in
san
felipe
cartwright
tone
seemed
to
subtly
change
his
commonplace
question
into
why
are
you
in
san
felipe
jefferson
worth
answer
was
straightforward
i
arrived
yesterday
conditions
have
arisen
that
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
see
you
at
once
the
old
veteran
looked
straight
into
jefferson
worth
face
with
the
understanding
of
one
who
had
himself
passed
through
many
a
financial
crisis
when
the
issue
depended
upon
time
gained
or
lost
sometimes
the
wheel
of
fortune
turns
with
dizzy
speed
certainly
worth
come
to
my
room
in
half
an
hour
he
answered
quickly
and
as
quickly
moved
away
when
the
king
basin
man
had
placed
the
situation
fairly
before
him
and
the
old
financier
had
asked
a
number
of
pertinent
questions
he
said
worth
i
understand
that
neither
the
value
nor
the
safety
of
my
investment
is
necessarily
impaired
because
you
have
a
situation
on
your
hands
demanding
immediate
relief
i
can
see
that
the
capital
you
ask
me
to
put
into
your
enterprise
will
relieve
the
situation
at
once
and
enable
you
to
place
the
whole
business
upon
a
solid
foundation
if
you
fail
to
raise
this
money
or
if
you
get
it
too
late
you
go
to
the
wall
and
i
lose
a
chance
for
what
seems
a
profitable
investment
as
i
told
you
legitimate
promotion
of
actual
development
projects
has
always
been
attractive
to
me
but
i
want
to
examine
into
matters
a
little
further
before
i
give
you
my
final
answer
frankly
i
want
to
ask
the
opinion
of
willard
holmes
i
would
not
place
too
much
confidence
in
greenfield
judgment
or
rather
i
should
say
in
any
advice
that
he
would
give
me
in
this
particular
matter
but
i
have
known
willard
from
babyhood
i
knew
his
father
and
the
whole
family
and
i
would
be
guided
by
his
opinion
as
an
engineer
of
conditions
in
the
new
country
in
which
you
are
all
interested
fortunately
holmes
is
here
in
the
hotel
let
me
have
a
little
talk
with
him
and
i
give
you
my
answer
without
delay
writing
a
brief
note
asking
the
engineer
to
come
to
his
room
he
summoned
a
boy
and
directed
him
to
deliver
the
message
immediately
a
few
minutes
later
jefferson
worth
in
the
lobby
saw
the
boy
approach
holmes
who
was
with
greenfield
the
engineer
took
the
note
from
the
boy
glanced
at
it
and
handed
it
to
his
companion
for
a
moment
they
stood
in
earnest
conversation
then
the
engineer
turned
and
moved
away
jefferson
worth
saw
him
enter
the
elevator
saw
the
ornamented
iron
door
close
and
the
cage
glide
smoothly
upward
james
greenfield
confident
with
the
air
of
one
whose
position
and
future
are
secure
jovially
greeted
one
of
the
new
york
party
who
came
up
on
holmes
departure
and
the
two
stood
laughing
and
chatting
over
their
cigars
jefferson
worth
sat
alone
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
lobby
chapter
xxvii
abe
lee
ride
to
save
jefferson
worth
the
evening
that
jefferson
worth
spent
in
the
san
felipe
hotel
lobby
apparently
absorbed
in
his
paper
while
greenfield
holmes
and
cartwright
with
their
new
york
friends
were
enjoying
their
dinner
barbara
and
her
court
had
their
anxious
supper
together
in
the
worth
home
the
night
that
followed
was
one
of
wakeful
readiness
on
the
part
of
the
men
who
guarded
the
worth
property
but
the
strikers
seemed
content
to
curse
and
threaten
breakfast
the
next
morning
in
spite
of
efforts
at
cheerfulness
was
a
gloomy
meal
worn
with
their
anxious
vigil
the
men
ate
in
silence
save
when
they
forced
themselves
to
respond
to
their
young
hostess
attempts
at
conversation
they
knew
that
another
day
of
idleness
would
fit
the
striking
laborers
for
reckless
action
when
the
meal
was
over
barbara
insisted
that
they
must
get
some
sleep
they
protested
but
she
argued
rightly
that
there
was
nothing
else
that
they
could
do
and
that
they
must
keep
themselves
fit
for
a
possible
need
of
their
strength
later
so
she
brought
comforts
and
blankets
for
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
the
little
sitting
room
and
drawing
the
shades
announced
that
she
would
take
her
sewing
to
the
front
porch
while
they
slept
three
hours
passed
and
a
boy
arrived
from
the
telegraph
office
with
a
message
addressed
to
abe
lee
speaking
in
low
tones
that
the
tired
men
within
might
not
be
disturbed
barbara
said
that
she
would
hand
the
message
to
lee
who
was
in
the
house
and
signed
her
name
in
the
book
then
as
the
boy
went
down
the
walk
the
young
woman
with
trembling
fingers
tore
open
the
yellow
envelope
the
message
read
money
by
wire
from
tenth
national
bank
new
york
pay
men
and
go
on
with
work
i
leave
for
home
jefferson
worth
barbara
and
her
desert
had
won
against
the
company
through
willard
holmes
but
barbara
did
not
know
that
behind
her
as
she
stood
with
the
yellow
slip
in
her
hand
the
sitting
room
door
opened
softly
and
turning
she
saw
abe
standing
on
the
threshold
the
alert
surveyor
had
been
aroused
by
the
coming
of
the
messenger
even
before
she
spoke
her
face
told
him
the
good
news
abe
went
at
once
to
notify
the
strikers
that
they
would
receive
their
pay
on
the
morrow
without
fail
to
several
of
the
leaders
he
exhibited
the
telegram
with
worth
instructions
pay
men
and
go
on
with
work
and
they
in
turn
verified
to
their
countrymen
the
good
news
as
the
word
went
around
the
dark
scowling
faces
were
lighted
with
satisfaction
and
pleased
anticipation
curses
and
threats
were
silenced
in
laughter
and
merry
talk
in
a
short
hour
or
two
the
little
army
of
striking
laborers
that
had
for
days
been
in
a
mood
for
any
violence
became
a
good
natured
crowd
bent
on
enjoying
to
the
full
their
short
holiday
barbara
insisted
on
serving
dinner
for
her
three
friends
and
with
the
strike
practically
settled
and
the
weary
strain
of
the
situation
removed
the
four
made
the
meal
a
jolly
one
when
they
could
eat
no
more
they
still
sat
idling
at
the
table
reluctant
to
break
the
spell
of
their
companionship
texas
joe
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
slow
smile
drawled
in
an
inconsequential
way
i
reckon
now
that
the
financial
obsequies
of
jefferson
worth
has
been
indefinitely
postponed
owin
to

barbara

the
old

his

so

as

me
put
my
fate
under
yer
table
they
all
laughed
at
pat
sentiments
which
the
other
two
men
endorsed
most
heartily
then
the
surveyor
with
his
two
helpers
went
up
town
stopping
at
the
bank
and
showing
the
cashier
his
message
from
worth
abe
asked
if
he
had
heard
from
new
york
before
answering
the
man
picked
up
a
telegram
from
his
desk
and
scanned
it
thoughtfully
no
said
greenfield
cashier
as
if
against
his
will
we
have
heard
nothing
just
before
the
close
of
banking
hours
the
surveyor
again
called
at
the
bank
any
news
from
new
york
yet
yes
we
had
their
wire
just
after
you
left
well
asked
abe
impatiently
is
it
all
right
it
all
right
lee
except
that
we
were
forced
to
answer
that
we
could
not
handle
the
business
the
surveyor
searched
his
pockets
for
tobacco
and
cigarette
papers
i
think
you
better
explain
mr
williams
again
the
cashier
hesitated
turning
thoughtfully
to
the
telegram
on
his
desk
then
he
said
reluctantly
it
is
greenfield
orders
lee
with
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
abe
lips
came
the
question
and
the
other
banks
in
the
basin
you
would
only
waste
your
time
thanks
williams
adios
abe
lee
walked
slowly
out
of
the
building
moving
aimlessly
down
the
street
unseeing
and
unheeding
he
ran
fairly
into
pat
and
texas
who
were
talking
with
a
rancher
from
the
south
central
district
the
voice
of
the
irishman
aroused
him
fwhat
the
hell
is
ut
dhrunk
ye
are
then
as
he
caught
a
good
look
at
the
surveyor
face
for
the
love
av
gawd
fwhat
wrong
wid
ye
lad
the
rancher
also
was
looking
at
him
curiously
abe
gained
control
of
himself
instantly
with
an
apologetic
laugh
excuse
me
pat
i
was
thinking
about
the
work
and
did
see
you
there
a
little
matter
that
i
want
to
take
up
with
you
this
afternoon
i
be
too
busy
for
it
the
rancher
with
another
word
or
two
turned
away
then
abe
in
a
low
tone
exclaimed
let
get
away
from
the
crowd
quick
where
we
can
talk
they
started
down
the
street
and
instinctively
their
feet
turned
toward
jefferson
worth
home
instead
of
toward
the
office
as
they
went
abe
explained
the
situation
pat
cursed
the
bank
and
james
greenfield
and
the
company
with
no
light
weight
curses
hell
will
sure
be
when
them
greasers
do
get
their
pay
checks
as
we
been
promisin
them
drawled
texas
joe
shaking
his
head
mournfully
for
regular
unexpectedness
this
here
business
gets
me
plumb
locoed
what
will
you
do
abe
greenfield
sure
takes
this
trick
do
he
they
had
reached
the
gate
of
the
worth
home
and
had
paused
as
people
sometimes
will
when
engaged
in
conversation
of
absorbing
interest
before
abe
could
answer
texas
barbara
who
sat
on
the
porch
called
laughingly
what
the
matter
with
you
men
are
you
hungry
again
why
do
you
come
in
in
consternation
the
three
looked
blankly
at
each
other
pat
growled
another
curse
under
his
breath
texas
shook
his
head
doubtfully
abe
groaned
she
have
to
know
boys
slowly
they
went
up
the
walk
and
barbara
as
they
drew
near
did
not
need
words
to
tell
her
that
something
seriously
wrong
had
happened
when
abe
had
explained
it
in
as
few
words
as
possible
she
said
but
it
will
only
be
for
a
few
days
a
few
days
will
be
too
late
said
abe
bluntly
we
have
promised
these
greasers
and
indians
that
we
will
pay
without
fail
when
we
do
pay
on
top
of
all
the
trouble
we
have
had
no
explanation
will
stand
they
go
on
the
warpath
sure
if
they
were
white
men
it
would
be
different
well
why
do
you
telegraph
father
and
let
him
bring
the
money
or
send
it
by
express
from
san
felipe
but
he
could
get
the
cash
started
before
afternoon
then
it
would
have
to
go
around
by
the
city
and
would
get
here
until
three
days
later
williams
did
tell
me
you
see
until
he
knew
that
the
san
felipe
bank
would
be
closed
before
i
could
get
a
message
through
they
sat
in
troubled
silence
pat
in
sullen
rage
texas
squatting
on
his
heels
fashion
abe
pulling
at
a
cigarette
barbara
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
three
hours
before
they
had
been
so
merry
because
the
trouble
was
over
now
they
faced
a
situation
many
times
more
perilous
than
before
with
a
quick
gesture
of
decision
abe
tossed
aside
his
cigarette
tex
where
is
that
buckskin
horse
of
yours
in
clark
stable
want
him
yes
give
him
a
good
feed
and
bring
him
here
as
soon
as
he
is
ready
bring
one
feed
and
a
canteen
and
while
the
horse
is
eating
go
around
to
my
room
and
get
my
gun
without
a
question
the
old
plainsman
left
the
group
and
walked
swiftly
away
barbara
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
asked
are
you
sending
tex
to
san
felipe
for
the
money
abe
i
am
going
myself
tex
will
be
needed
here
he

of
me

this
end
of
the
game

make
it
to
san
felipe
in
hours
that
will
be
evening
if
your
father
can
have
the
money
ready
i
should
be
back
here
by
friday
night
while
speaking
he
was
tearing
a
leaf
from
his
note
book
quickly
he
wrote
a
message
to
jefferson
worth
pat
take
this
to
the
telegraph
office
and
make
them
rush
it
it
must
catch
worth
before
he
leaves
at
barbara
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
please
let
me
go
let
me
do
something
abe
handed
her
the
slip
of
paper
with
a
smile
if
you
do
mind
i
will
take
a
nap
in
your
father
room
and
will
you
ask
ynez
to
have
a
bite
to
eat
ready
for
me
with
a
sandwich
or
two
that
i
can
slip
into
my
pocket
pat
you
stay
here
and
do
let
anyone
disturb
me
until
then
call
me
sure
tex
will
be
here
with
the
horse
by
that
time
with
the
last
word
he
disappeared
into
the
house
when
pat
called
him
he
was
sleeping
soundly
barbara
had
sent
the
telegram
and
with
her
own
hands
prepared
his
supper
and
a
lunch
while
he
ate
the
surveyor
gave
brief
instructions
to
his
two
helpers
then
barbara
went
with
him
to
the
gate
where
the
buckskin
horse
one
of
that
tough
wiry
breed
native
to
the
western
plains
waited
head
down
with
bridle
reins
hanging
to
the
ground
as
abe
tightened
the
cinch
and
took
his
spurs
from
the
saddle
horn
the
girl
went
closer
to
his
side
i
wish
you
did
not
have
to
go
she
said
as
he
stooped
to
put
on
a
spur
he
straightened
up
and
looked
at
her
the
brown
eyes
regarded
him
seriously
why
barbara
you
are
not
afraid
texas
and
pat
will
be
here
it
not
myself
abe
it
you
she
answered
you
have
had
such
a
hard
time
since
this
trouble
began
and
now
this
long
lonely
ride
i
wish
there
was
some
other
way
stooping
quickly
so
that
she
might
not
see
his
face
he
adjusted
the
other
spur
with
trembling
fingers
i
shall
think
of
you
every
minute
abe
said
the
young
woman
softly
the
strap
of
the
spur
required
several
ineffectual
efforts
before
the
man
could
fasten
it
on
the
steel
button
at
length
it
was
on
and
rising
again
he
threw
the
bridle
reins
over
the
horse
head
holding
them
in
his
left
hand
on
the
animal
neck
barbara
came
still
closer
and
with
her
finger
traced
the
design
carved
on
the
heavy
mexican
saddle
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
abe
the
hand
on
the
horse
neck
tightened
on
the
reins
as
the
surveyor
looked
straight
into
the
young
woman
eyes
a
moment
as
if
searching
for
something
that
he
knew
was
not
there
then
he
held
out
his
free
hand
saying
in
spanish
with
a
smile
adios
sister
giving
him
her
hand
she
answered
in
the
same
soft
musical
tongue
adios
my
brother
turning
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
with
the
easy
graceful
swing
of
the
western
horseman
he
mounted
and
the
buckskin
as
his
rider
lifted
the
bridle
reins
struck
at
once
into
the
long
lazy
lope
of
his
kind
leisurely
abe
lee
rode
along
the
main
street
of
the
little
town
the
strikers
idling
in
front
of
the
stores
leaning
against
the
buildings
or
awning
posts
squatting
on
their
heels
on
the
sidewalks
or
sitting
in
rows
on
the
curbing
saw
him
pass
without
interest
if
they
thought
anything
it
was
that
the
superintendent
was
going
to
kingston
on
some
business
or
other
for
their
employer
senor
worth
or
that
the
man
on
the
buckskin
horse
would
give
them
the
slips
of
paper
that
they
would
take
to
the
senor
at
the
bank
who
would
give
them
their
money
still
riding
leisurely
abe
left
behind
the
town
that
jefferson
worth
had
built
in
the
barren
desert
and
passed
the
newly
improved
ranches
on
the
outskirts
without
hurry
even
checking
his
horse
to
a
shuffling
at
times
he
reached
kingston
from
the
window
of
his
office
in
the
company
building
burk
saw
the
horseman
as
he
passed
and
the
company
manager
who
was
paid
for
thinking
shifted
his
cigar
to
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
tilting
his
head
grew
thoughtful
while
the
buckskin
horse
carried
his
rider
out
of
kingston
toward
the
south
reaching
the
old
san
felipe
trail
the
surveyor
swung
his
horse
to
the
west
and
leaving
behind
all
that
man
had
so
far
wrought
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
rode
straight
toward
the
mountain
wall
that
in
grim
barrenness
and
forbidding
solitude
had
stood
sentinel
through
the
unnumbered
ages
shutting
out
from
the
land
of
death
the
world
of
life
that
lay
on
the
other
side
as
that
mighty
wall
had
from
the
beginning
turned
back
every
cloud
from
the
thirsty
starving
land
so
it
seemed
now
to
impose
itself
as
an
impassable
barrier
against
the
man
who
rode
to
save
the
work
of
jefferson
worth
the
buckskin
horse
as
if
realizing
that
this
was
no
jaunt
of
ten
or
twenty
miles
held
to
his
steady
lope
that
measured
the
distance
of
each
swing
with
the
accurate
regularity
of
a
pendulum
while
the
lean
loose
body
of
his
rider
resting
easily
in
the
saddle
yielded
without
resistance
to
the
horse
every
movement
so
that
those
laboring
muscles
working
so
smoothly
under
the
yellow
hide
might
not
be
called
upon
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
sudden
strain
of
unexpected
changes
in
balance
mile
after
mile
of
the
dun
plain
slipped
away
under
those
apparently
hoofs
at
surprising
speed
now
and
then
at
the
slightest
signal
from
abe
the
gait
was
changed
from
a
lope
to
that
easy
shuffling
that
lifted
the
dust
in
a
great
yellow
cloud
straight
ahead
the
rider
saw
the
sun
go
slowly
down
behind
the
mountain
wall
he
watched
the
purple
shadows
that
he
knew
were
canyons
deepen
and
the
blue
that
he
knew
to
be
shoulders
and
spurs
and
points
change
and
darken
until
every
detail
was
lost
in
the
slate
gray
mass
while
against
the
light
that
lingered
in
the
west
every
tooth
knob
and
peak
of
the
showed
a
sharp
silhouette
he
saw
the
colors
of
the
desert
fade
and
melt
as
the
dark
mantle
of
the
night
was
drawn
quietly
over
the
plain
he
heard
the
night
voices
of
the
desert
awakening
and
sensed
the
soft
breathing
of
the
lonely
land
and
in
his
nostrils
was
the
indescribable
odor
of
the
ancient
that
for
uncounted
thousands
of
years
had
lain
under
a
blazing
sun
and
scorching
wind
and
mistless
nights
knowing
no
touch
of
human
life
save
the
passing
presence
of
those
who
dared
to
follow
that
one
thin
trail
and
always
with
that
dogged
regularity
the
sandy
miles
were
being
measured
by
those
steady
hoofs
at
wolf
wells
as
the
last
faint
tinge
of
light
went
out
of
the
sky
beyond
the
black
mass
of
no
mountains
abe
drew
rein
for
the
first
time
dismounting
he
slipped
the
bit
from
the
horse
mouth
and
the
animal
plunged
his
nose
deep
into
the
refreshing
water
the
buckskin
with
the
blood
of
his
wild
ancestors
strong
in
his
veins
was
no
dainty
aristocrat
that
needed
to
be
rested
cooled
and
blanketed
before
he
could
slake
his
thirst
without
pausing
he
drank
his
fill
and
then
lifting
his
head
drew
one
long
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
and
stood
ready
in
the
dark
abe
felt
his
saddle
girths
then
ran
his
hand
over
the
moist
warm
neck
and
slapped
the
strong
hips
approvingly
good
boy
buck
good
old
boy
without
thought
of
further
rest
they
went
on
on
and
on
without
pause
or
cheek
save
the
occasional
change
in
gait
from
the
swinging
lope
to
the
shuffling
until
they
reached
the
line
of
the
ancient
beach
and
the
buckskin
with
head
down
labored
heavily
up
the
steep
grade
to
the
mesa
it
was
at
this
point
years
before
that
the
four
men
and
the
boy
had
stopped
to
look
away
over
the
scenes
of
wide
sky
measureless
plain
rolling
sand
hills
dream
lakes
and
seas
of
color
all
hidden
now
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
in
the
dark
devil
canyon
the
sound
of
the
horse
feet
echoed
and
sharply
from
the
rock
walls
while
the
darkness
was
so
thick
that
abe
could
not
see
the
animal
head
at
mountain
spring
where
travelers
into
the
desert
always
filled
their
water
barrels
abe
stopped
again
it
was
a
little
past
midnight
loosing
the
saddle
girth
and
removing
the
bridle
the
surveyor
let
his
horse
drink
and
taking
a
sack
with
his
one
feed
of
rolled
barley
he
deftly
converted
it
into
a
rude
by
cutting
a
strip
in
each
side
the
length
of
the
sack
and
tying
it
over
the
head
after
eating
his
own
lunch
the
surveyor
stretched
himself
out
flat
on
his
back
on
the
ground
with
every
muscle
relaxed
the
sound
of
the
horse
munching
his
feed
ceased
the
animal
head
dropped
lower
and
he
too
wise
in
the
wisdom
of
the
open
country
relaxed
his
muscles
and
rested
for
an
hour
they
remained
there
then
again
the
bridle
was
adjusted
the
saddle
girths
tightened
and
they
went
on
but
the
gait
was
not
so
measured
now
nor
the
pace
so
steady
for
they
were
well
into
the
mountains
climbing
toward
the
summit
but
still
there
was
no
pause
for
breath
no
relief
for
the
straining
muscles
of
the
horse
or
for
the
weary
aching
body
of
the
rider
crossing
over
the
summit
at
last
they
were
on
the
long
western
slope
of
the
range
with
much
better
going
and
the
buckskin
again
carried
his
rider
swiftly
on
while
the
thud
and
ring
of
the
hoofs
on
the
road
aroused
the
echoes
in
the
dark
and
lonely
hills
hour
after
hour
of
the
long
night
passed
with
no
sound
to
break
the
silence
save
the
sound
of
the
horse
feet
the
rattle
of
bridle
chains
the
clink
of
spur
or
the
creak
of
saddle
leather
and
when
the
gray
of
the
morning
came
they
were
in
the
foot
hills
behind
them
the
mountains
a
bare
and
forbidding
wall
on
the
desert
side
lifted
ridge
upon
ridge
with
the
green
of
pine
on
the
heights
oak
on
the
slopes
and
benches
and
sycamore
in
the
lower
canyons
streams
of
bright
water
tumbled
merrily
down
their
clean
rocky
courses
or
rested
in
quiet
pools
in
the
cold
shadows
before
them
spread
the
beautiful
coast
country
sloping
with
many
a
dip
and
hollow
and
rolling
ridge
and
rounding
hill
westward
to
the
sea
at
the
first
ranch
house
they
stopped
a
short
hour
rest
with
breakfast
for
man
and
horse
and
they
were
away
again
for
dinner
abe
drew
rein
in
a
beautiful
little
village
in
the
heart
of
the
rich
farming
country
and
at
four
from
the
summit
of
a
low
hill
he
saw
the
ocean
with
the
smoke
of
san
felipe
dark
against
the
blue
of
sky
and
water
there
were
yet
three
hours
of
riding
the
tired
man
straightened
himself
in
the
saddle
the
horse
felt
the
motion
and
responded
with
a
slight
quickening
of
the
movements
of
those
wonderful
muscles
that
still
worked
so
steadily
and
smoothly
under
the
buckskin
coat
the
animal
seemed
to
realize
with
the
man
that
the
end
of
the
journey
was
in
sight
yet
it
would
take
another
hour
and
another
of
that
steady
measured
lope
and
the
easy
shuffling
the
sun
was
dipping
downward
now
toward
the
ocean
rim
and
sea
and
sky
were
a
blaze
of
glorious
light
while
on
that
dazzling
background
sail
and
mast
and
roof
and
steeple
were
painted
black
with
edges
of
yellow
flame
the
horse
with
the
dogged
determined
spirit
of
his
breed
was
drawing
upon
the
last
of
his
strength
the
strength
that
had
brought
them
so
many
miles
without
faltering
but
still
he
answered
gamely
to
the
lifting
of
the
reins
with
that
measured
swinging
lope
but
as
he
watched
the
sun
go
down
abe
lee
forgot
his
weariness
forgot
his
aching
muscles
and
stiffened
limbs
he
remembered
only
that
miles
away
in
the
little
desert
town
there
was
a
mob
of
striking
mexicans
and
indian
laborers
who
disappointed
and
enraged
at
not
receiving
their
promised
pay
would
be
ready
now
for
any
deed
that
promised
to
satisfy
their
blind
desire
for
vengeance
he
knew
that
no
explanations
would
be
accepted
no
plea
for
patience
would
be
heard
they
could
not
understand
in
their
eyes
they
had
been
tricked
fooled
cheated
defrauded
of
their
just
dues
they
knew
no
better
way
to
redress
their
wrongs
than
the
primitive
way
to
destroy
to
injure
perhaps
to
kill
and
barbara
barbara
was
there
if
only
they
would
let
that
one
night
pass
if
only
tex
and
pat
and
the
little
handful
of
white
men
could
hold
them
off
a
few
more
hours
until
he
could
get
back
until
he
could
get
back
but
what
if
jefferson
worth
had
not
received
the
telegram
before
he
left
san
felipe
what
if
there
should
be
a
still
further
delay
in
getting
the
money
through
the
lighted
streets
of
the
harbor
city
the
buckskin
and
his
rider
finally
made
their
way
a
policeman
looking
suspiciously
at
the
trembling
horse
that
stood
with
legs
braced
wide
and
drooping
head
and
at
the
rider
directed
the
surveyor
to
the
hotel
a
block
away
and
then
stood
watching
them
as
they
moved
slowly
toward
the
end
of
the
ride
chapter
xxviii
what
the
company
man
told
the
mexicans
while
barbara
and
her
three
friends
at
home
were
rejoicing
over
the
message
from
jefferson
worth
telling
them
that
he
had
secured
the
money
needed
to
go
on
with
the
work
willard
holmes
was
alone
in
his
room
in
the
san
felipe
hotel
following
the
engineer
interview
with
cartwright
he
had
passed
through
a
stormy
scene
with
james
greenfield
and
the
words
of
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
were
ringing
in
his
ears
with
painful
monotony
discharged
discharged
discharged
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
engineer
had
heard
those
words
addressed
to
himself
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
feeling
that
he
had
come
suddenly
to
the
end
of
his
career
all
his
life
willard
holmes
had
had
back
of
him
the
powerful
influence
of
his
foster
uncle
positions
and
opportunities
had
come
to
him
from
the
first
without
effort
on
his
part
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
his
ability
as
an
engineer
was
naturally
of
a
high
order
and
that
his
training
was
of
the
best
he
had
never
been
dependent
wholly
upon
these
things
other
and
stronger
considerations
had
always
given
him
his
place
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
faced
the
world
of
his
profession
with
nothing
but
his
naked
ability
as
an
engineer
to
speak
for
him
while
his
abrupt
dismissal
from
the
company
compelled
him
to
realize
with
sudden
force
how
his
work
had
always
been
by
outside
influences
and
how
dependent
he
had
been
upon
them
he
felt
lost
and
bewildered
knowing
not
which
way
to
turn
his
future
seemed
a
blank
he
had
been
anxious
and
eager
to
get
back
to
his
work
in
the
basin
but
he
had
not
realized
how
much
that
work
meant
to
him
how
his
plans
his
dreams
his
whole
life
work
had
become
centered
in
the
reclamation
of
the
king
basin
desert
if
his
dismissal
had
come
from
anything
connected
with
his
work
he
told
himself
it
would
be
different
he
thought
bitterly
how
he
had
struggled
with
insufficient
equipment
and
inadequate
makeshifts
of
every
kind
to
hold
the
company
system
together
that
the
pioneers
might
have
the
water
without
which
the
work
of
reclamation
could
not
be
done
he
knew
every
stake
and
pile
and
plank
and
crack
and
patch
in
the
whole
system
he
had
learned
the
tricks
of
the
river
and
was
familiar
with
the
conditions
peculiar
to
the
desert
country
he
knew
the
terrible
danger
of
the
flood
season
that
was
only
two
months
away
he
had
planned
and
prepared
to
meet
emergencies
that
would
be
sure
to
arise
and
now
because
he
had
refused
to
deliver
the
settlers
wholly
into
the
hands
of
these
new
york
capitalists
who
cared
nothing
at
all
for
the
real
work
save
as
it
could
be
made
to
increase
their
money
bags
he
was
turned
out
there
was
now
no
reason
even
for
his
return
to
the
basin
why
he
asked
himself
should
he
go
back
to
see
some
other
man
doing
his
work
to
watch
as
an
outsider
the
development
of
the
land
or
perhaps
as
was
more
likely
to
stand
idly
by
and
watch
its
destruction
but
even
as
he
told
himself
that
he
could
not
do
that
he
knew
that
he
would
go
back
that
indeed
he
must
go
the
desert
called
him
summoned
him
imperatively
the
desert
and
something
else
something
that
was
as
mysteriously
impelling
as
the
spirit
of
the
land
something
that
had
grown
into
his
life
even
as
his
work
had
grown
something
that
seemed
to
him
now
a
part
of
his
work
from
the
beginning
all
that
day
the
engineer
avoided
greenfield
and
his
eastern
friends
in
the
evening
he
dined
alone
and
after
the
meal
sat
alone
in
the
hotel
lobby
with
his
back
to
the
crowd
watching
through
the
big
window
the
life
of
the
street
outside
watching
without
seeing
moodily
he
pulled
at
his
cigar
his
thoughts
far
away
in
barbara
desert
where
unknown
to
him
abe
lee
on
the
buckskin
horse
was
riding
riding
riding
to
save
the
work
of
jefferson
worth
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
jefferson
worth
himself
who
seeing
the
engineer
alone
had
gone
to
him
holmes
drawing
another
chair
close
to
his
greeted
barbara
father
with
eager
questions
have
you
heard
from
home
is
everything
all
right
the
older
man
accepted
the
chair
by
the
engineer
side
and
answered
his
questions
by
saying
cartwright
instructed
his
new
york
bankers
to
wire
this
money
to
my
account
in
republic
i
notified
abe
to
pay
the
men
and
go
on
with
the
work
it
was
characteristic
of
jefferson
worth
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
thank
holmes
for
his
part
in
the
transaction
with
cartwright
but
in
some
subtle
way
the
engineer
was
made
to
feel
his
gratitude
and
appreciation
after
a
pause
worth
continued
i
am
going
to
start
back
on
the
when
are
you
figuring
on
going
back
the
engineer
smiled
grimly
i
ca
figure
on
anything
definite
just
now
worth
i
might
as
well
tell
you
i
suppose
that
i
am
no
longer
connected
with
the
company
the
announcement
did
not
appear
to
be
unexpected
to
jefferson
worth
but
his
slim
fingers
caressed
his
chin
as
he
said
i
was
afraid
of
that
have
you
anything
in
view
holmes
felt
that
not
only
had
worth
foreseen
the
situation
but
that
he
had
already
set
in
motion
some
movement
to
relieve
it
no
sir
it
came
so
suddenly
that
i
have
scarcely
had
time
to
think
i
figured
some
time
ago
that
the
company
would
not
be
able
to
hold
you
much
longer
was
the
surprising
comment
the
has
been
looking
for
a
good
man
to
put
down
in
our
country
for
some
time
your
experience
on
the
river
would
make
you
particularly
valuable
to
them
under
existing
conditions
i
told
them
about
you
they
have
been
holding
off
waiting
developments
if
i
were
you
i
would
get
in
touch
with
them
at
once
you
can
go
up
to
the
city
with
me
we
will
stop
over
and
look
into
the
proposition
and
then
if
it
is
all
right
and
agreeable
to
you
we
can
go
on
home
together
jefferson
worth
seemed
to
understand
perfectly
the
engineer
desire
to
return
to
the
basin
before
holmes
could
express
his
delight
and
gratitude
at
the
unexpected
relief
a
passing
among
the
guests
shouted
jefferson
worth
jefferson
worth
the
banker
opened
the
message
read
it
then
without
a
the
yellow
slip
to
his
companion
the
engineer
read
banks

accept
new

handle

abe

starting
for

felipe
overland
have
money
and

ready
barbara
holmes
looked
in
consternation
from
the
paper
in
his
hand
to
father
the
face
of
jefferson
worth
expressed
nothing
it
was
perfectly
calm
and
emotionless
only
the
slim
fingers
were
lifted
to
the
chin
as
if
behind
that
gray
mask
the
mind
of
the
man
was
groping
seizing
searching
examining
every
phase
of
the
situation
so
suddenly
confronting
him
in
answer
to
the
engineer
questioning
look
he
spoke
in
colorless
words
with
exactness
as
if
the
matter
under
consideration
were
a
mere
mathematical
problem
presented
for
his
solution
the
company
owns
the
banks
greenfield
went
into
the
telegraph
office
this
morning
as
cartwright
and
i
came
out
abe
would
get
my
message
by
nine
the
banks
would
get
instructions
the
same
time
abe
would
at
once
promise
the
men
their
money
that
cashier
did
tell
him
they
would
handle
the
business
until
too
late
for
him
to
get
me
before
the
banks
closed
here
greenfield
is
playing
for
time
so
that
the
strikers
will
make
trouble
abe
has
it
figured
out
right
he
can
get
here
and
back
before
i
could
get
the
money
to
him
by
train
he
should
reach
here
night
there
is
nothing
to
do
except
to
see
cartwright
this
evening
so
that
he
can
wire
new
york
and
i
can
get
the
cash
through
the
bank
here
before
abe
gets
in
as
he
grasped
the
situation
and
the
methods
greenfield
had
employed
to
injure
worth
interests
the
engineer
eyes
flashed
worth
he
cried
that
is
the
dirtiest
trick
i
ever
saw
turned
it
business
holmes
greenfield
is
merely
using
his
advantage
that
all
the
methods
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
in
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
were
the
methods
of
capital
impersonal
inhuman
the
methods
of
a
force
governed
by
laws
as
fixed
as
the
laws
of
nature
neither
cruel
nor
kind
inconsiderate
of
man
misery
or
happiness
his
life
or
death
using
man
for
its
own
ends
profit
as
men
use
water
and
soil
and
sun
and
air
the
methods
of
jefferson
worth
were
the
methods
of
a
man
laboring
with
his
brother
men
sharing
their
hardships
sharing
their
returns
a
man
using
money
as
a
workman
uses
his
tools
to
fashion
and
build
and
develop
adding
thus
to
the
welfare
of
human
kind
it
was
inevitable
that
the
company
and
jefferson
worth
should
war
james
greenfield
served
capital
jefferson
worth
sought
to
make
capital
serve
the
race
but
in
the
career
of
each
of
these
men
who
had
been
driven
by
the
master
passion
good
business
into
the
hollow
of
hand
the
dominant
influence
was
a
life
in
the
career
of
jefferson
worth
it
was
barbara
in
the
career
of
james
greenfield
it
was
willard
holmes
in
the
king
basin
reclamation
work
the
new
york
financier
whose
relation
to
willard
holmes
was
a
tribute
to
his
love
for
the
mother
felt
that
in
some
way
for
some
cause
which
he
could
not
understand
the
younger
man
was
growing
away
from
him
their
relation
of
employer
and
employe
seemed
to
mar
the
close
intimacy
of
the
old
ties
and
the
older
man
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
time
when
his
business
plans
should
be
carried
to
a
successful
climax
and
they
would
both
leave
the
west
for
their
eastern
home
that
morning
in
the
hotel
when
he
saw
holmes
go
with
cartwright
to
jefferson
worth
and
by
that
knew
that
the
engineer
had
used
his
influence
against
the
interests
of
the
company
he
was
astonished
and
hurt
he
felt
that
the
boy
whom
he
had
reared
as
his
own
had
turned
against
him
as
the
president
of
the
company
he
abruptly
discharged
the
engineer
for
he
could
do
nothing
else
as
the
of
willard
holmes
he
was
still
proud
of
the
younger
man
strength
of
character
for
under
all
his
anger
at
being
thwarted
in
his
plan
against
worth
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
engineer
had
done
right
as
the
day
passed
and
the
engineer
did
not
seek
his
company
while
greenfield
own
stubborn
pride
forbade
him
to
go
to
holmes
the
older
man
heart
grew
more
and
more
lonely
that
evening
when
he
saw
jefferson
worth
and
holmes
together
in
earnest
conversation
and
through
all
of
the
following
day
saw
them
apparently
associated
intimately
in
some
plan
or
enterprise
for
the
first
time
personal
feeling
entered
into
his
consideration
of
the
whole
situation
he
felt
that
his
business
rival
had
become
his
rival
for
the
affections
of
the
boy
he
loved
the
business
victories
of
jefferson
worth
he
could
accept
without
feeling
but
that
this
man
a
stranger
should
come
between
him
and
his
the
child
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
with
lifelong
fidelity
stirred
him
to
a
vicious
personal
hatred
at
dusk
that
evening
he
saw
holmes
and
worth
dining
together
when
the
meal
was
over
he
sat
in
the
lobby
ostensibly
chatting
with
friends
but
covertly
watching
the
two
who
seemed
to
be
awaiting
someone
suddenly
he
saw
them
rise
quickly
and
start
toward
the
main
entrance
a
dusty
man
of
the
desert
was
entering
the
hotel
tall
lean
bronzed
his
face
haggard
and
strained
with
anxiety
his
eyes
through
loss
of
sleep
his
figure
expressing
in
every
line
and
movement
deadly
weariness
and
aching
muscles
he
strode
forward
into
the
hotel
lobby
his
spurs
clinking
on
the
white
tile
floor
greenfield
recognized
abe
lee
and
grasped
the
situation
instantly
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
knew
why
the
surveyor
had
come
to
san
felipe
and
he
knew
what
he
would
carry
back
if
the
money
to
pay
the
strikers
reached
its
destination
jefferson
worth
would
win
if
not
at
half
past
nine
that
evening
the
thoughtful
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
received
a
cipher
message
from
his
superior
that
drew
a
long
low
whistle
from
his
lips
for
almost
an
hour
he
considered
with
an
occasional
quiet
curse
then
because
he
was
a
good
company
man
he
put
on
his
hat
and
strolled
leisurely
down
the
street
of
kingston
apparently
enjoying
his
evening
cigar
once
he
stopped
to
greet
a
belated
rancher
again
he
paused
to
chat
a
moment
with
a
citizen
once
more
he
halted
to
exchange
a
word
with
a
group
of
company
men
and
later
stopped
to
greet
three
mexicans
who
were
in
from
the
company
camps
the
manager
asked
of
the
work
if
all
was
well
si
senor
then
naturally
burk
inquired
for
news
of
their
countrymen
the
strikers
of
republic
the
mexicans
coming
from
the
distant
camp
could
tell
him
nothing
they
had
heard
little
could
senor
burk
tell
them
of
the
situation
the
manager
was
quite
sure
that
everything
would
be
all
right
with
the
men
on
jefferson
worth
railroad
day
after
that
was
bueno
yes
worth
superintendent
was
starting
from
san
felipe
that
very
evening
with
money
thousands
of
dollars
american
gold
to
pay
the
men
he
was
coming
alone
through
the
mountains
on
horseback
without
doubt
the
men
would
receive
their
pay
the
manager
was
glad
si
senor
gracias
senor
buenos
noches
good
night
chapter
xxix
tell
barbara
i
all
right
when
abe
lee
after
hard
hours
in
the
saddle
dismounted
in
front
of
the
san
felipe
hotel
and
entered
the
lobby
his
usually
perfect
nerves
were
strained
almost
to
the
breaking
point
for
weeks
the
surveyor
had
carried
the
burden
of
jefferson
worth
financial
condition
as
if
it
were
his
own
with
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
work
he
loved
better
than
his
life
wrecked
and
taken
over
by
the
company
he
had
for
days
faced
the
critical
situation
of
the
strike
then
in
the
very
hour
of
relief
the
situation
had
become
seemingly
hopeless
abe
lee
better
than
anyone
knew
the
temper
of
the
mexican
and
indian
strikers
he
realized
fully
how
great
the
chances
were
that
at
the
very
moment
when
he
finished
his
ride
for
relief
the
town
of
republic
was
the
scene
of
tragic
violence
if
jefferson
worth
had
left
san
felipe
ignorant
of
the
failure
of
his
effort
to
relieve
the
dangerous
situation
at
home
or
if
by
some
chance
the
money
so
desperately
needed
was
not
ready
abe
knew
that
the
cause
was
lost
the
company
would
triumph
as
he
entered
the
hotel
his
eyes
searching
eagerly
for
his
employer
fell
first
on
james
greenfield
with
a
movement
wholly
involuntary
the
hand
of
the
overwrought
desert
man
came
to
rest
on
his
hip
close
to
the
heavy
colt
then
he
saw
jefferson
worth
and
willard
holmes
moving
towards
him
when
a
man
feels
himself
in
a
fight
and
is
struggling
desperately
to
hold
his
ground
he
has
small
thought
for
the
trifling
courtesies
demanded
by
custom
without
returning
the
greetings
of
the
two
men
and
instinctively
drawing
apart
from
holmes
the
surveyor
shot
a
single
question
at
his
employer
have
you
got
it
everything
is
all
right
answered
jefferson
worth
and
with
his
words
something
of
his
calm
confidence
went
to
abe
lee
when
the
two
men
reached
worth
apartment
the
surveyor
without
hesitation
began
stripping
off
his
clothes
i
want
a
good
bath
first
he
said
and
while
i
am
at
it
will
you
please
have
a
good
thick
beefsteak
cooked
rare
and
sent
up
here
then
i
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
buckskin
of
texas
joe
is
standing
in
from
of
the
hotel
he
about
all
in
i
wish
that
you
would
see
that
he
is
cared
for
as
he
finished
speaking
the
tall
lean
figure
of
the
surveyor
disappeared
through
the
bath
room
door
worth
sent
the
order
for
his
superintendent
supper
to
the
cook
with
a
sum
of
money
that
insured
immediate
and
careful
attention
then
with
his
own
hands
he
led
the
buckskin
horse
to
a
barn
where
the
animal
would
have
the
care
he
had
so
well
earned
when
worth
returned
to
the
hotel
he
opened
the
door
of
his
room
softly
there
was
a
tray
of
empty
dishes
on
the
table
an
odor
of
cigarette
smoke
in
the
atmosphere
and
in
his
employer
bed
the
surveyor
sound
asleep
abe
lee
understood
the
value
of
every
moment
even
in
taking
rest
two
hours
later
worth
going
again
to
his
room
found
that
the
surveyor
had
just
finished
dressing
with
a
smile
the
financier
handed
abe
a
slip
of
yellow
paper
it
was
a
message
from
barbara
saying
that
so
far
all
was
well
at
home
and
concluded
with
the
words
love
to
abe
without
a
word
abe
turned
away
to
buckle
about
his
hips
the
broad
cartridge
belt
with
its
worn
holster
and
his
big
black
gun
but
barbara
father
did
not
see
him
slip
the
bit
of
yellow
paper
into
the
pocket
of
his
blue
flannel
shirt
then
worth
gave
the
surveyor
a
black
leather
stuffed
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
secured
with
rubber
bands
here
it
is
he
said
abe
stored
the
package
in
an
inner
pocket
of
his
khaki
coat
and
was
ready
at
the
barn
they
found
willard
holmes
waiting
with
two
horses
the
engineer
wore
a
new
belt
holster
and
revolver
when
he
had
greeted
them
he
said
well
are
we
all
ready
i
have
a
lunch
here
is
there
anything
else
abe
looked
at
him
questioningly
and
turned
to
worth
holmes
is
going
back
with
you
said
the
banker
for
an
instant
the
surveyor
hesitated
but
something
in
his
tone
caused
him
to
withhold
any
objection
and
with
no
comment
he
turned
to
inspect
the
horses
the
animals
were
of
the
same
tough
breed
as
the
buckskin
they
all
right
are
they
abe
asked
of
the
liveryman
you
can
see
for
yourself
came
the
answer
you
know
the
kind
ai
nothin
can
outlast
an
worth
said
that
was
what
he
wanted
we
will
need
one
feed
apiece
said
abe
put
it
in
two
sacks
you
know
sure
returned
the
man
i
it
ready
but
this
here
gentleman
did
tell
me
while
the
liveryman
was
preparing
the
grain
abe
examined
saddles
and
cinches
are
your
stirrups
right
he
asked
holmes
i
think
so
you
better
know
we
do
want
to
stop
to
monkey
around
in
the
dark
the
barn
man
grinned
with
a
wink
at
the
surveyor
as
the
engineer
decided
after
trying
that
he
had
better
shorten
the
straps
a
hole
abe
silently
assisted
him
in
adjusting
them
then
swinging
into
his
saddle
the
surveyor
said
to
his
employer
as
the
horses
moved
ahead
sir
wire
little
sister
that
i
coming
along
the
lighted
city
streets
they
rode
at
a
pace
that
seemed
to
willard
holmes
more
fitting
for
ladies
gentle
exercise
than
for
two
men
bound
on
an
errand
against
time
the
eastern
man
urged
his
horse
ahead
but
his
companion
held
back
and
holmes
was
forced
to
check
his
speed
and
wait
for
the
other
to
come
up
with
him
to
the
attempts
at
conversation
the
other
answered
only
in
monosyllables
or
not
at
all
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
worth
to
explain
to
abe
the
engineer
part
in
helping
him
to
secure
the
money
from
cartwright
and
the
consequent
discharge
of
holmes
by
greenfield
to
the
mind
his
companion
belonged
to
the
enemy
he
could
not
understand
why
with
the
victory
or
defeat
of
jefferson
worth
in
his
fight
with
the
company
hanging
upon
his
superintendent
mission
the
chief
engineer
should
volunteer
to
accompany
him
the
presence
of
greenfield
and
holmes
in
san
felipe
the
action
of
the
banks
controlled
by
the
company
made
it
clear
to
abe
that
they
understood
the
dangerous
situation
of
worth
and
his
urgent
need
of
immediate
relief
the
company
had
everything
to
gain
if
the
arrival
of
the
money
at
the
scene
of
the
strike
could
be
delayed
even
for
a
few
hours
but
abe
had
seen
that
it
was
jefferson
worth
wish
that
holmes
go
with
him
and
the
surveyor
could
not
in
the
presence
of
holmes
discuss
the
question
on
his
part
holmes
felt
the
antagonism
of
his
silent
companion
but
could
not
guess
the
reason
while
abe
attitude
of
aloofness
prevented
the
engineer
from
making
any
explanation
he
told
himself
that
the
surveyor
was
naturally
with
the
mental
and
physical
strain
of
his
long
ride
and
that
later
at
some
more
opportune
time
when
they
halted
for
lunch
and
rest
perhaps
they
would
come
to
a
more
agreeable
spirit
of
companionship
but
he
could
not
content
himself
with
the
slow
pace
when
there
was
such
evident
need
of
haste
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
thought
for
the
man
already
wearied
to
undertake
the
return
trip
a
fresh
rider
was
as
necessary
as
a
fresh
horse
the
surveyor
was
evidently
too
exhausted
to
push
on
at
the
necessary
speed
and
holmes
felt
that
it
fell
upon
him
to
set
the
pace
and
thus
force
his
companion
to
the
exertion
required
so
he
continued
urging
his
horse
ahead
while
abe
mount
held
back
by
his
rider
tugged
at
the
reins
and
grew
restless
and
the
horse
of
holmes
now
started
sharply
forward
now
pulled
down
almost
to
a
standstill
became
equally
uneasy
so
they
rode
out
of
the
city
beyond
the
lights
and
movement
of
the
streets
into
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
at
last
as
holmes
again
touched
his
horse
with
the
spur
making
him
bound
several
lengths
ahead
and
again
pulled
him
down
waiting
for
abe
to
overtake
him
the
western
man
broke
the
long
silence
you
have
to
quit
that
holmes
he
said
somewhat
sharply
the
engineer
did
not
understand
quit
what
breaking
ahead
like
that
i
set
the
pace
for
this
trip
you
do
seem
to
be
in
any
hurry
retorted
holmes
nettled
by
the
surveyor
tone
i
ai
not
in
that
kind
of
a
hurry
but
look
here
abe
do
you
know
that
worth
expects
us
to
make
the
trip
in
the
shortest
possible
time
we
got
to
get
that
money
into
republic
evening
and
before
if
we
can
there
is
too
much
at
stake
to
poke
along
like
this
abe
reflected
the
company
man
certainly
understood
the
situation
aloud
he
said
i
think
i
know
what
jefferson
worth
wants
holmes
and
i
reckon
you
have
to
trust
me
to
carry
out
his
wishes
i
know
the
distance
i
know
this
road
and
i
know
horse
flesh
a
little
at
the
rate
you
trying
to
go
you
be
afoot
before
noon
you
can
ride
your
own
horse
down
if
you
want
to
but
you
ca
hinder
me
by
fretting
mine
into
unnecessary
exertion
he
need
every
ounce
of
his
strength
and
i
going
to
see
that
he
does
waste
any
of
it
either
push
ahead
out
of
sight
and
hearing
as
fast
as
you
please
or
turn
back
but
if
you
ride
with
me
you
quit
this
monkey
business
and
ride
quietly
at
the
gait
i
set
willard
holmes
instantly
saw
the
force
of
the
western
man
words
i
beg
your
pardon
lee
he
said
of
course
you
know
best
i
so
anxious
over
this
business
that
i
acting
like
a
fool
after
that
companionship
was
a
little
easier
but
under
the
circumstances
the
one
topic
most
on
the
mind
of
each
was
carefully
avoided
at
midnight
they
stopped
at
the
crossing
of
a
stream
to
water
and
feed
and
abe
showed
his
companion
how
to
make
a
nosebag
out
of
the
sack
in
which
his
grain
was
carried
daybreak
found
them
in
the
foothills
at
the
ranch
where
abe
had
been
accommodated
the
morning
before
they
again
halted
for
breakfast
with
another
feed
for
the
horses
tied
behind
their
saddles
they
began
the
long
climb
of
the
western
slope
of
the
mountains
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
had
crossed
over
the
summit
and
reached
the
spring
at
the
head
of
devil
canyon
the
last
water
they
would
find
until
they
reached
wolf
wells
in
the
desert
when
they
dismounted
at
the
watering
place
some
two
hundred
yards
off
the
trail
the
surveyor
after
slipping
the
bit
from
his
horse
mouth
and
loosening
the
saddle
girth
moved
slowly
about
the
little
glen
his
eyes
on
the
ground
holmes
standing
by
the
horses
which
had
their
muzzles
deep
in
the
cool
water
watched
his
companion
wearily
lost
something
he
asked
as
abe
continued
moving
cautiously
about
not
yet
came
the
laconic
reply
well
what
the
deuce
are
you
looking
for
then
abe
coming
back
to
arrange
the
feed
for
his
horse
looked
closely
at
his
companion
but
made
no
answer
when
the
two
men
had
thrown
themselves
on
the
grass
to
eat
their
lunch
the
surveyor
between
bites
of
his
sandwich
carefully
scanned
the
mountain
side
and
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
below
suddenly
reaching
out
his
hand
he
picked
up
a
burnt
cigarette
butt
and
regarded
it
intently
while
the
engineer
watched
him
with
curious
amused
interest
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
abe
you
act
like
one
of
heroes
what
the
matter
with
that
cigarette
stub
the
man
of
the
desert
knowing
nothing
of
cooper
did
not
smile
but
answered
shortly
eyeing
the
engineer
as
he
spoke
it
ai
dry
there
was
a
party
at
this
watering
place
not
more
than
three
hours
ago
well
what
of
it
this
is
government
property
probably
somebody
ahead
of
us
going
into
the
new
country
to
locate
there
been
nobody
ahead
of
us
all
day
how
do
you
know
that
abe
shrugged
his
shoulders
how
do
i
know
that
a
party
of
five
or
six
watered
here
since
noon
perhaps
it
someone
going
out
did
we
meet
anyone
this
is
the
only
trail
well
maybe
it
was
a
party
of
prospectors
or
hunters
they
would
not
follow
the
road
they
would
have
pack
burros
or
mules
nothing
but
horses
in
this
bunch
they
the
surveyor
turned
his
head
quickly
to
look
up
the
hill
his
ear
had
caught
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
on
the
mountain
road
above
holmes
looking
also
saw
a
horseman
ride
leisurely
around
the
turn
and
down
the
grade
toward
the
canyon
silently
they
watched
and
as
the
newcomer
came
nearer
they
saw
that
he
was
a
mexican
when
the
traveler
reached
the
point
where
he
should
have
turned
aside
to
the
water
he
did
not
pause
but
jogged
steadily
past
by
george
exclaimed
holmes
i
believe
that
one
of
our
greasers
from
the
outfit
in
number
eight
i
know
it
is
said
abe
perhaps
you
can
make
a
guess
as
to
what
doing
here
and
why
he
did
stop
for
water
as
the
surveyor
spoke
he
was
rolling
a
cigarette
and
from
the
cloud
of
smoke
he
watched
the
mexican
ride
down
the
mountain
side
and
disappear
between
the
narrow
walls
of
devil
canyon
i
sure
i
do
know
what
he
doing
he
seems
to
be
going
toward
the
desert
there
might
be
a
hundred
different
reasons
why
he
should
have
been
out
somewhere
there
only
one
reason
why
he
did
stop
for
water
at
this
place
what
that
he
had
already
watered
but
there
has
been
no
chance
for
miles
back
he
watered
here
holmes
spoke
sharply
abe
manner
irritated
him
i
do
see
how
you
know
because
this
is
the
only
water
for
twenty
miles
going
either
way
but
you
said
you
thought
there
was
a
party
of
five
or
six
i
know
there
are
five
or
six
where
are
the
others
then
if
this
man
was
one
of
the
party
i
do
know
exactly
where
they
are
but
i
can
guess
by
this
time
willard
holmes
had
come
to
see
that
to
his
companion
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
the
incident
than
the
surveyor
chose
to
put
into
words
abe
throwing
away
his
cigarette
and
rolling
another
with
his
fingers
seemed
to
be
striving
to
arrive
at
some
conclusion
about
something
that
to
the
engineer
was
all
very
much
in
the
dark
aggravated
by
the
reticence
of
his
companion
holmes
burst
forth
with
for
heaven
sake
abe
open
up
what
on
your
mind
what
the
matter
anyway
what
all
this
about
abe
faced
the
engineer
with
a
straight
hard
look
do
you
know
what
it
all
about
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
all
about
nothing
at
all
tell
me
well
holmes
i
will
but
i
not
sure
yet
that
it
will
be
news
to
you
the
rest
of
the
gang
that
watered
here
is
down
in
devil
canyon
waiting
for
us
they
were
here
something
like
three
hours
ago
after
watering
one
of
them
went
on
over
the
ridge
to
watch
for
us
and
the
others
went
back
down
the
canyon
they
knew
that
we
would
stop
here
to
feed
and
water
and
that
the
lookout
could
jog
along
past
apparently
minding
his
own
business
and
tell
that
we
were
coming
you
mean
it
a
cried
holmes
in
some
excitement
that
what
i
would
call
it
your
company
would
probably
call
it
intercepting
worth
messenger
the
company
what
has
the
company
to
do
with
it
greenfield
and
you
were
in
san
felipe
you
knew
what
i
went
after
you
know
that
the
chances
are
big
that
jefferson
worth
will
go
to
smash
if
i
do
make
it
to
republic
and
that
greaser
is
a
company
man
in
a
flash
holmes
saw
the
whole
situation
from
his
companion
point
of
view
and
understood
the
surveyor
suspicions
at
the
same
time
the
engineer
realized
that
it
was
now
too
late
for
him
to
explain
his
presence
or
that
he
was
no
longer
connected
with
the
company
in
his
perplexity
and
chagrin
and
in
the
suddenness
of
it
all
he
said
the
worst
thing
possible
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
abe
voice
was
hard
i
not
going
to
take
any
fool
chances
this
may
be
a
plain
ordinary
case
of
or
it
may
be
a
job
framed
up
by
the
company
simply
to
delay
me
it
all
the
same
to
me
but
this
money
goes
to
republic
sabe
that
the
other
would
have
spoken
but
abe
interrupted
we
palavered
long
enough
holmes
the
horses
have
finished
their
feed
and
it
time
to
start
when
they
were
mounted
the
surveyor
said
shortly
now
sir
you
just
ride
ahead
and
you
ride
slow
until
i
give
the
word
then
you
go
like
hell
if
you
lift
a
hand
to
signal
or
make
any
mistakes
like
stopping
to
fix
your
saddle
girth
or
checking
up
to
speak
to
that
bunch
or
turning
i
get
you
first
and
you
ca
afford
to
have
any
hazy
notions
about
my
not
wanting
to
kill
you
because
you
from
new
york
if
you
square
you
can
make
good
on
those
company
greasers
down
there
and
i
apologize
afterwards
if
you
in
this
deal
with
your
damned
company
you
stop
drawing
your
salary
right
here
and
there
wo
be
any
funeral
expenses
for
them
to
pay
either
go
ahead
just
a
word
first
and
abe
saw
that
the
engineer
was
as
cool
as
a
veteran
granting
that
you
are
right
about
that
crowd
being
down
there
to
stop
us
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
tell
me
how
to
get
into
republic
with
the
money
you
will
be
taking
no
chances
with
that
at
least
follow
the
trail
to
the
telephone
line
you
know
it
from
there
there
water
at
wolf
wells
give
your
horse
a
drink
but
do
wait
to
rest
you
can
push
him
from
now
on
as
hard
as
you
like
you
should
make
it
to
republic
in
six
hours
from
here
give
the
money
to
miss
worth
anything
else
holmes
replied
by
turning
in
his
saddle
and
moving
ahead
abe
followed
his
horse
nose
even
with
the
flank
of
the
animal
in
the
lead
easily
they
jogged
ahead
down
the
grade
toward
the
narrow
throat
of
the
canyon
a
hundred
yards
from
where
two
points
of
jutting
rock
in
the
walls
of
the
mountain
hallway
leave
an
opening
not
more
than
fifty
feet
wide
holmes
with
the
slightest
turn
of
his
head
spoke
over
his
shoulder
i
see
a
man
face
looking
around
that
point
of
rock
on
the
right
be
ready
when
i
give
the
word
wo
they
pot
us
not
if
they
can
get
the
drop
they
turn
us
loose
on
the
desert
shall
i
shoot
behind
the
engineer
back
abe
smiled
grimly
when
they
halt
us
and
i
give
the
word
cut
loose
if
you
want
to
i
take
all
on
the
left
the
distance
lessened
to
a
hundred
feet
suddenly
from
the
left
three
mounted
mexicans
pushed
into
the
road
and
from
the
right
two
more
even
as
they
threw
up
their
guns
and
called
alto
halt
abe
gave
the
word
now
the
two
white
men
drove
their
spurs
deep
into
their
horses
flanks
throwing
themselves
forward
in
their
saddles
with
the
same
motion
with
mad
plunges
the
animals
leaped
toward
the
highwaymen
even
as
he
spoke
abe
gun
had
cracked
thrice
in
quick
succession
the
mexicans
firing
at
about
the
same
instant
two
of
the
horsemen
on
the
left
went
down
and
the
surveyor
reeled
almost
out
of
his
saddle
but
holmes
did
not
see
his
own
revolver
barked
a
prompt
second
to
abe
and
on
his
side
a
mexican
went
over
clutching
at
his
saddle
horn
the
horses
of
the
mexicans
were
rearing
and
plunging
the
quick
reports
of
the
revolvers
echoed
viciously
from
the
rocky
walls
but
the
white
men
went
through
down
the
rocky
hallway
they
raced
side
by
side
now
as
hard
as
their
maddened
horses
could
run
a
moment
to
slip
fresh
cartridges
into
his
cylinder
and
holmes
cried
to
his
companion
good
stuff
old
man
go
on
i
hold
and
before
abe
could
grasp
his
purpose
he
had
jerked
his
horse
to
his
haunches
and
wheeling
faced
back
up
the
canyon
and
disappeared
around
a
turn
even
as
the
surveyor
was
trying
to
check
his
own
horse
a
brute
another
rattling
volley
of
revolver
shots
echoed
down
the
canyon
by
the
time
abe
had
succeeded
in
turning
his
stubborn
mount
holmes
all
over
the
engineer
sang
out
as
his
companion
wheeled
again
and
rode
beside
him
two
of
were
coming
after
us
i
got
one
and
the
other
turned
tail
he
winced
with
pain
as
he
spoke
they
presented
me
with
a
little
souvenir
though
abe
saw
that
his
left
arm
was
swinging
loosely
you
are
hurt
he
said
sharply
reining
up
his
horse
where
is
it
here
in
my
shoulder
it
do
amount
to
anything
let
get
on
to
water
and
i
fix
it
up
with
the
word
the
engineer
whose
mount
had
also
stopped
started
ahead
the
horse
went
a
few
steps
and
stumbled
struggled
to
regain
his
feet
staggered
weakly
a
few
steps
farther
stumbled
again
and
went
down
as
he
fell
holmes
sprang
clear
the
animal
raised
his
head
made
another
attempt
to
rise
and
dropped
back
another
bullet
from
the
last
encounter
had
found
a
mark
the
dismounted
engineer
who
stood
as
if
dazed
staring
at
his
dead
horse
was
aroused
by
the
voice
of
abe
lee
it
looks
like
we
got
all
that
was
coming
to
us
this
trip
at
his
companion
tone
holmes
looked
up
quickly
the
surveyor
lips
were
white
and
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
the
man
on
the
ground
sprang
toward
him
with
a
startled
exclamation
you
too
abe
where
is
it
my
leg
on
the
other
side
quickly
the
engineer
went
around
lee
horse
to
find
the
leg
of
the
surveyor
khaki
trousers
darkly
stained
with
blood
get
down
he
commanded
and
reaching
with
his
uninjured
arm
almost
lifted
his
companion
from
the
saddle
an
examination
revealed
an
ugly
hole
in
the
surveyor
thigh
with
handkerchiefs
and
some
strips
cut
from
the
engineer
coat
they
dressed
their
wounds
as
best
they
could
when
they
had
finished
holmes
straightened
up
and
looked
around
behind
them
was
the
bold
mountain
wall
grim
and
forbidding
on
either
hand
the
dry
barren
mesa
and
ahead
the
miles
and
miles
of
desert
as
if
in
answer
to
his
thoughts
the
man
on
the
ground
said
grimly
this
is
hell
now
ai
it
holmes
i
make
that
apology
if
you
please
would
you
mind
shaking
hands
with
me
willard
holmes
grasped
the
hand
cordially

did
just
right
old
man
it
was
the
only
thing
you
could
do
but
i
want
to
tell

anything
else

because
i
helped
jefferson
worth
to
interest
the
capitalist
who
is
furnishing
him
the
money
he
needs
for
a
moment
abe
lee
looked
at
the
engineer
in
silence
then
his
pale
lips
twisted
into
a
smile
holmes
would
you
mind
shaking
hands
again
with
a
laugh
the
engineer
once
more
held
out
his
hand
then
he
asked
seriously
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
of
this
abe
the
smile
was
already
gone
from
the
surveyor
face
he
answered
slowly
with
dogged
determination
in
his
voice
we
got
to
get
this
money
to
republic
it
the
only
thing
that
will
stop
those
cholos
and
cocopahs

make
it
to
water
together
then
you
can
go
on
help
me
up
with
the
engineer
assistance

managed
to
gain
his
seat
in
the
saddle
holmes
mounting
behind
and
thus
they
made
their
way
down
into
the
basin
and
to
wolf
wells
illustration
adios
tell
barbara
i
all
right
there
holmes
helped
his
companion
from
the
horse
and
to
the
shade
of
a
mesquite
tree
near
the
water
hole
where
he
stood
over
him
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
protesting
vigorously
against
leaving
him
alone
in
the
desert
but
the
surveyor
argued
him
down
i
could
possibly
make
it
if
we
had
another
horse
he
said
i
down
and
out
there
be
hell
to
pay
in
republic
even
if
the
boys
have
held
them
off
this
long
the
money
got
to
get
there
this
evening
you
can
reach
there
by
ten
and
send
a
wagon
back
for
me
do
you
see
there
no
other
way
he
held
out
the
black
leather
with
the
rubber
bands
here
take
this
and
go
on
go
on
man
what
a
night
in
the
desert
to
me
but
those
greasers
may
come
this
way
they
wo
but
if
they
should
i
have
my
gun
have
i
and
i
see
them
before
they
see
me
go
on
i
tell
you
we
lost
too
much
time
already
think
of
that
mob
and
barbara
you
got
to
go
holmes
the
engineer
turned
towards
his
horse
old
man
adios
tell
barbara
i
all
right
abe
lee
watched
the
loping
horse
grow
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
then
watched
the
cloud
of
dust
that
lifted
from
the
trail
to
hang
all
golden
in
the
last
of
the
light
turning
he
saw
the
summit
of
the
mountain
wall
sharply
defined
against
the
sky
with
a
groan
his
form
relaxed
he
closed
his
eyes
he
was
indeed
down
and
out
the
desert
night
fell
softly
over
the
wide
thirsty
plain
the
snarling
coyote
chorus
came
out
of
the
gloom
out
there
willard
holmes
was
riding
riding
riding
along
the
old
san
felipe
trail
away
over
there
somewhere
under
those
stars
barbara
was
waiting
his
return
he
remembered
her
parting
words
and
how
he
had
failed
to
find
in
her
eyes
that
which
he
had
longed
to
see
he
felt
for
the
paper
in
the
pocket
of
his
shirt
love
to
abe
she
would
never
have
sent
that
message
had
her
love
been
other
than
it
was
abe
lee
born
and
reared
in
the
desert
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
deceive
himself
for
his
work
and
for
the
woman
whose
life
was
so
strangely
and
closely
bound
up
with
it
he
had
given
the
utmost
limit
of
his
strength
and
now
another
man
would
finish
the
ride
and
go
to
her
with
the
prize
not
that
it
would
make
any
difference
to
barbara
but
somehow
it
mattered
a
great
deal
to
abe
willard
holmes
who
in
spite
of
his
splendid
strength
had
not
the
desert
man
powers
of
endurance
clung
grimly
to
one
thought
the
money
must
go
to
republic
the
steady
rhythm
of
his
horse
feet
seemed
to
beat
out
the
word
barbara
barbara
barbara
the
trying
scene
with
greenfield
the
long
hard
hours
in
the
saddle
the
excitement
of
the
fight
in
the
canyon
with
his
anxiety
for
his
wounded
companion
left
alone
in
the
desert
were
almost
too
much
could
he
hold
out
could
he
make
it
he
the
engineer
held
his
seat
with
the
strength
of
desperation
he
the
money
must
go
to
republic
that
night
to
barbara
barbara
barbara
the
horse
feet
seemed
to
have
beaten
out
the
word
for
ages
for
ages
he
had
been
riding
riding
riding
towards
some
point
out
there
ahead
in
the
desert
night
the
engineer
knew
now
what
it
was
that
called
him
back
chapter

the
night
when
abe
lee
started
on
his
ride
from
republic
to
san
felipe
passed
quietly
in
the
little
desert
town
texas
and
pat
with
a
few
faithful
white
men
guarded
the
worth
property
lest
in
some
way
the
news
that
worth
would
be
unable
to
pay
as
his
superintendent
had
promised
should
get
out
and
precipitate
a
crisis
but
the
strikers
continued
to
enjoy
peacefully
their
holiday
looking
forward
to
the
morrow
when
they
would
be
enriched
with
nearly
two
months
pay
when
the
morrow
came
the
laborers
their
dark
faces
beaming
with
childish
happiness
gathered
early
in
front
of
jefferson
worth
office
texas
and
pat
with
the
men
of
the
office
force
who
had
been
up
all
night
were
sleeping
for
another
night
of
guard
duty
was
before
them
when
it
was
ten
and
no
one
had
arrived
at
the
office
the
crowd
of
laborers
began
to
show
signs
of
growing
impatience
then
someone
recalled
seeing
abe
riding
on
the
buckskin
horse
toward
the
south
and
suspicion
grew
at
last
a
few
of
the
more
intelligent
went
in
a
body
to
the
bank
we
come
to
see
you
about
money
you
sabe
about
money
what
money
is
that
asked
the
man
behind
the
window
shortly
our
money
for
work
on
railroad
senor
worth
was
to
pay
el
superintendente
say
pay
sure
he
no
come
you
sabe
i
sabe
that
worth
wo
pay
no
no
he
has
no
money
here
the
mexicans
exchanged
glances
no
money
you
are
quite
sure
senor
sure
gracias
senor
adios
it
was
a
dangerous
crowd
that
filled
the
streets
of
republic
that
afternoon
and
evening
and
all
through
the
night
that
followed
the
friends
of
jefferson
worth
expected
every
hour
the
fulfillment
of
the
strikers
threats
soon
after
breakfast
which
pat
and
tex
shared
with
barbara
the
message
came
from
worth
telling
them
that
abe
was
on
his
way
home
with
the
money
again
the
men
were
told
that
they
would
receive
their
pay
on
the
morrow
but
this
time
the
announcement
was
received
with
black
scowls
and
muttered
curses
of
disbelief
they
make
us
damn
fools
one
time
how
we
know
this
time
not
the
same
asked
one
of
the
leaders
speaking
for
the
crowd
mebbe
senor
tex
you
not
know
mebbe
they
fool
you
like
us
we
get
money
this
day
we
glad
go
work
we
no
get
money
by
this
night
an
expressive
shrug
of
the
shoulders
finished
the
sentence
the
attitude
of
the
citizens
of
republic
was
one
of
angry
indifference
they
were
angry
both
with
jefferson
worth
and
the
strikers
because
the
trouble
was
unsettling
and
harmful
to
the
best
interests
of
all
the
business
in
the
town
and
to
some
degree
turned
the
inflowing
stream
of
settlers
and
investors
towards
other
points
of
the
new
country
they
were
indifferent
because
of
that
underlying
conviction
brought
about
by
mysteriously
authoritative
rumors
and
whispered
statements
from
supposed
inside
sources
that
the
cause
of
the
trouble
was
a
fight
between
jefferson
worth
and
the
company
whether
capitalists
rise
or
capitalists
fall
is
always
a
matter
of
indifference
to
all
who
are
not
themselves
of
the
capitalist
class
for
capital
continues
its
mastery
of
them
just
the
same
no
one
doubted
that
the
railroad
would
be
finished
whether
jefferson
worth
failed
or
not
horace
blanton
was
not
backward
in
expressing
the
popular
feeling
and
the
popular
feeling
often
expressed
grows
ever
more
popular
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
pablo
who
had
been
mingling
with
his
countrymen
all
day
came
to
headquarters
to
report
the
strikers
were
planning
to
attack
their
employer
property
that
night
pablo
was
certain
that
the
mob
would
go
first
to
the
power
plant
and
the
adjoining
buildings
no
help
was
to
be
had
from
the
citizens
and
save
for
the
few
white
men
in
worth
employ
who
had
been
made
to
understand
the
situation
and
the
reason
for
the
delay
tex
and
pat
were
alone
they
knew
that
there
was
small
chance
of
abe
arrival
until
well
toward
midnight
for
a
little
they
considered
the
situation
then
the
old
frontiersman
spoke
hit
stands
to
reason
that
pablo
here
is
right
an
that
the
stampede
will
head
toward
the
works
first
they
all
go
together
they
ai
here
later
after
they
made
their
biggest
play
now
pablo
you
listen
get
two
horses
sabe
two
one
for
ynez
and
one
for
yourself
and
have
them
with
el
capitan
for
la
senorita
ready
by
the
back
door
you
watch
if
senor
lee
comes
tell
him
quick
to
go
to
the
power
house
if
the
men
come
take
the
women
on
the
horses
and
get
out
of
the
way
you
understand
si
senor
i
will
care
for
la
senorita
texas
joe
turned
to
barbara
i
do
reckon
they
get
here
at
all
for
i
bank
on
pat
an
me
fixin
somethin
to
interest
until
abe
gets
here
but
it
best
to
be
fixed
for
what
you
ai
expectin
you
be
a
heap
better
off
with
pablo
anywhere
away
from
here
if
they
should
come
this
way
when
the
night
fell
texas
and
pat
went
to
the
scene
of
the
expected
trouble
and
barbara
was
left
with
pablo
the
mexican
prepared
the
horses
as
texas
had
instructed
and
then
took
up
his
position
by
the
front
gate
proud
and
happy
that
they
had
so
honored
him
that
they
had
trusted
him
to
guard
his
employer
daughter
the
darkness
deepened
watchful
alert
pablo
strove
to
see
into
the
gloom
and
listened
to
catch
the
first
sound
of
approaching
friend
or
enemy
the
white
men
should
learn
that
he
could
protect
la
senorita
la
senorita
who
in
rubio
city
had
been
to
him
an
angel
of
mercy
when
he
was
lying
injured
la
senorita
whom
they
all
loved
behind
him
the
door
of
the
house
opened
letting
out
a
flood
of
light
then
closed
in
the
darkness
a
voice
called
softly
pablo
are
you
there
si
senorita
you
want
me
barbara
came
quickly
down
the
walk
to
his
side
it
so
lonely
and
still
in
the
house
pablo
may
i
stay
out
here
a
little
with
you
we
can
both
watch
surely
la
senorita
could
stay
why
not
pablo
was
to
protect
her
not
to
keep
her
a
prisoner
she
laughed
quietly
i
believe
you
would
do
anything
for
me
pablo
i
would
protect
la
senorita
with
my
life
he
answered
simply
i
believe
you
would
pablo
and
so
would
tex
and
pat
and
abe
you
are
all
so
good
to
me
and
i
i
feel
so
good
for
nothing
so
useless
in
the
darkness
the
musical
voice
of
pablo
answered
our
love
for
la
senorita
is
so
great
it
is
like
the
desert
in
the
gentle
moonlight
so
big
and
wide
it
is
like
the
soft
night
under
the
stars
so
deep
everybody
so
loves
la
senorita
and
anyone
loved
that
way
can
not
be
what
you
say
good
for
nothing
sometime
men
love
like
the
sun
on
the
desert
in
day
time
fierce
and
hot
and
that
is
different
that
makes
sometimes
trouble
sometime
make
men
kill
it
is
not
good
la
senorita
but
it
is
so
they
heard
a
galloping
horse
coming
nearer
and
nearer
barbara
touched
her
companion
arm
and
pablo
laid
a
hand
on
his
revolver
was
it
abe
was
it
someone
to
say
that
the
mob
was
coming
the
horse
and
rider
passed
and
the
sound
of
their
going
died
away
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
pablo
what
time
will
they
go
to
the
power
house
any
time
now
senorita
barbara
spoke
quickly
eagerly
now
are
there
not
a
good
many
of
your
countrymen
from
rubio
city
among
them
pablo
si
senorita
and
do
they
do
they
remember
me
surely
no
one
who
lived
in
rubio
city
could
forget
la
senorita
who
was
so
kind
to
the
poor
then
pablo
i
have
a
plan
to
help
i
did
not
tell
texas
and
pat
but
ynez
is
not
in
the
house
i
sent
her
away
this
evening
to
stay
with
a
friend
on
the
other
side
of
town
si
senorita
the
soft
voice
was
perplexed
and
troubled
pablo
i
am
going
to
the
power
house
to
help
no
no
senorita
it
can
not
be
yes

come

losing
time

not
be
too
late
you
get
the
horses
she
went
quickly
into
the
house
and
when
she
came
out
again
the
mexican
still
protesting
held
the
horses
ready
at
the
power
house
texas
and
pat
sat
just
inside
the
main
entrance
in
the
big
room
beyond
them
the
great
dynamos
that
furnished
electricity
to
all
the
towns
for
lights
and
supplied
the
ice
plant
the
shops
and
every
enterprise
needing
it
throughout
the
basin
with
power
hummed
and
sang
their
monotonous
song
of
industry
in
front
of
the
building
a
large
arc
light
made
the
immediate
vicinity
as
bright
as
day
on
every
side
of
all
the
buildings
in
the
group
where
the
little
handful
of
white
men
stood
guard
similar
lights
had
been
placed
by
abe
at
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
howly
mither
wud
ye
look
at
that
came
from
pat
as
barbara
followed
by
pablo
rode
into
the
circle
of
light
with
an
oath
from
texas
joe
the
two
men
ran
forward
and
as
they
came
up
to
the
riders
the
irishman
cried
fwhat

a
laugh
barbara
dismounted
and
telling
pablo
to
tie
the
horses
to
the
hitch
rack
a
short
distance
away
faced
the
astonished
men
there
nothing
wrong
at
the
house
but
i
knew
you
must
be
lonesome
here
so
i
came
to

the

pablo

the
mexican
leading
the
horses
moved
on
toward
the
hitching
place
texas
scratched
his
head
in
a
puzzled
way
while
pat
grinned

the
two

at

in
amazement
before
they
could
find
words
for
a
question
pablo
came
running
back
to
them
they
coming
senorita
senor
tex
they
coming
he
was
right
texas
joe
caught
barbara
by
the
arm
and
with
the
three
men
she
ran
into
the
building
just
as
the
crowd
of
mexican
and
indian
laborers
reached
the
outer
edge
of
the
lighted
space
while
still
in
the
shadow
of
the
night
the
crowd
halted
and
the
watchers
in
the
buildings
could
see
them
across
the
broad
belt
of
light
a
stirring
restless
mass
of
men
shadowy
and
indistinct
now
and
then
a
single
figure
in
the
white
canvas
jumper
trousers
and
wide
sombrero
of
the
mexicans
or
wearing
the
blue
overalls
and
black
shirt
decorated
with
many
brightly
colored
ribbons
and
the
green
yellow
or
orange
head
cloth
of
the
indians
would
detach
itself
from
the
main
company
and
coming
nearer
would
stand
out
with
sudden
startling
clearness
disappearing
again
as
suddenly
in
the
dark
mass
as
it
again
moved
farther
away
here
and
there
in
the
confusion
of
dusky
moving
forms
a
face
would
appear
as
someone
looking
up
at
the
electric
light
caught
its
rays
full
upon
his
swarthy
features
or
the
watchers
would
catch
the
gleam
and
flash
from
a
weapon
a
belt
buckle
or
an
ornament
as
the
mob
of
men
moved
uneasily
about
still
farther
away
the
restless
stirring
mass
was
dissolved
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
they
palaverin
about
the
lights
said
texas
to
his
companions
ca
jest
figure
the
deal
under
abe
illumination
they
all
plumb
anxious
but
they
nobody

cholos
considerin
the
lad
may
git
here
yet
even
as
the
irishman
spoke
the
crowd
seemingly
agreeing
upon
a
plan
moved
forward
slowly
in
a
body
when
they
were
well
within
the
lighted
space
texas
drawled
right
here
where
i
feel
moved
to
address
the
meetin
and
throwing
open
the
door
he
stepped
out
upon
the
platform
which
was
built
to
the
height
of
a
above
the
level
of
the
ground
with
steps
at
each
end
standing
thus
in
the
bright
light
of
the
arc
that
sputtered
over
his
head
he
was
seen
instantly
by
every
eye
in
the
crowd
as
if
by
command
they
halted
standing
motionless
their
dark
faces
turned
toward
the
old
plainsman
texas
spoke
in
their
own
tongue
good
evening
men
why
do
you
come
here
at
this
time
of
the
night
what
do
you
want
there
was
an
angry
shifting
to
and
fro
in
the
mass
of
men
and
a
mexican
standing
well
to
the
front
answered
what
should
we
want
senor
texas
but
our
pay
we
have
worked
four
five
seven
weeks
without
money
we
must
have
money
to
buy
food
clothes
tobacco
do
not
the
commissaries
in
the
camps
supply
you
with
all
that
you
need
surely
you
can
wait
a
few
hours
longer
you
will
be
paid
every
cent
manana
manana
always
the
superintendent
promised
other
time
the
superintendent
lied
now
we
will
not
wait
for
cries
of
approval
greeted
the
bold
speech
but
we
can
not
pay
you
we
have
not
the
money
here
that
is
too
bad
for
senor
worth
then
if
he
can
not
pay
he
should
have
told
us
so
that
we
could
work
for
the
company
the
company
can
pay
but
worth
will
pay
morning
a
chorus
of
angry
jeering
yells
greeted
this
repeated
promise
with
cries
of
pronto
esta
dia
and
no
manana
now
and
not
the
movement
toward
the
building
began
again
instantly
the
arms
of
the
man
on
the
platform
were
extended
and
the
mob
saw
in
each
hand
the
familiar
colt
of
the
old
time
west
the
forward
movement
was
checked
men
cried
texas
in
his
deliberate
way
you
can
not
come
any
nearer
these
buildings
there
are
americans
here
friends
of
worth
who
are
ready
to
shoot
when
i
give
the
word
i
can
kill
twelve
of
you
myself
before
you
can
get
to
this
platform
go
away
quietly
and
in
the
morning
you
will
get
your
money
come
one
step
nearer
this
building
and
many
of
you
will
die
the
moment
was
intense
a
shot
a
yell
a
sudden
movement
would
have
precipitated
a
tragedy
in
the
full
glare
of
the
light
against
the
blackness
of
the
night
the
crowd
of
picturesque
laborers
hesitated
standing
on
the
platform
under
the
arc
that
sputtered
and
sizzled
his
back
to
the
building
the
single
figure
of
texas
joe
was
ready
with
menacing
weapons
behind
the
brick
walls
the
handful
of
armed
white
men
were
waiting
watching
miles
away
in
the
desert
abe
lee
was
lying
wounded
and
alone
under
the
still
stars
and
somewhere
in
the
night
willard
holmes
desperately
holding
his
seat
in
the
saddle
was
forcing
his
already
exhausted
horse
toward
the
end
of
his
mission
as
the
muscles
of
a
tiger
work
and
twitch
when
the
beast
makes
ready
for
its
spring
a
movement
agitated
the
mob
and
a
low
growling
murmur
came
from
the
mass
of
men
texas
spoke
sharply
ready
you
fellows
in
there
if
they
start
let
them
have
it
the
murmur
swelled
in
volume
into
an
angry
inarticulate
roar
the
movement
increased
an
instant
more
and
it
would
launch
the
mob
in
a
mad
rush
suddenly
as
a
beast
checked
in
its
spring
they
were
still
and
motionless
by
the
side
of
the
old
frontiersman
on
the
platform
under
the
light
stood
barbara
let
me
speak
to
them
tex
without
pausing
for
the
astonished
man
to
reply
she
spoke
to
the
mob
in
spanish
her
voice
rising
clearly
and
sweetly
do
you
know
me
friends
from
different
points
in
the
crowd
came
the
answers
si
senorita
it
is
the
daughter
of
senor
worth
among
the
poor
in
rubio
city
la
senorita
was

found
a
place
for

helped
you
bury
your
mother
and

come
to
destroy
my
father
buildings
why
do
you
wish
to
do
that
the
mexicans
whom
she
called
by
name
stirred
uneasily
but
did
not
answer
those
who
had
known
barbara
in
rubio
city
were
few
among
the
whole
number
of
laborers
and
to
these
others
she
was
only
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
was
robbing
them
of
their
pay
the
one
who
had
so
far
acted
as
spokesman
answered
angrily
must
we
say
again
what
we
want
if
you
are
as
they
say
an
angel
of
mercy
give
us
our
money
and
we
will
go
away
cries
of
si
si
bueno
muy
pronto
el
dinero
and
give
us
our
money
arose
on
all
sides
you
shall
have
your
money
every
penny
can
not
you
wait
until
morning
the
impatient
cries
were
louder
now
la
senorita
also
say
all
the
rich
say
all
time
to
the
poor
and
manana
never
come
give
us
our
money
now
the
cries
were
increasing
in
volume
as
man
after
man
joined
in
the
chorus
of
threatening
protest
white
and
trembling
barbara
realized
that
she
could
do
nothing
more
texas
said
in
a
low
voice
for
god
sake
honey
get
inside
before
they
break
loose
go
now
now
his
voice
rose
into
a
sharp
command
and
his
steady
hands
again
brought
the
deadly
revolvers
into
position
the
young
woman
reluctantly
drew
a
step
backward
in
obedience
then
suddenly
with
wide
eyes
staring
over
the
crowd
into
the
darkness
beyond
and
extended
hand
pointing
she
sprang
forward
to
the
very
edge
of
the
platform
texas
texas
look
he
is
coming
abe
is
here
overcome
with
emotion
she
swayed
and
would
have
fallen
but
texas
caught
and
steadied
her
every
man
in
the
crowd
turned
quickly
toward
the
rear
a
horseman
shadowy
and
indistinct
beyond
the
circle
of
light
was
riding
toward
them
as
the
newcomer
pushed
his
horse
nearer
and
they
saw
that
it
was
willard
holmes
barbara
uttered
a
cry
and
turned
away
but
the
quick
eye
of
texas
joe
had
seen
that
the
engineer
horse
was
staggering
with
exhaustion
and
that
the
man
could
scarcely
keep
his
seat
in
the
saddle
wait
honey
he
said
delaying
the
young
woman
this
may
pan
out
yet
barbara
paused
but
did
not
turn
toward
the
approaching
engineer
slowly
holmes
forced
his
horse
reeking
with
sweat
and
dust
into
the
crowd
that
opened
for
him
to
pass
and
closed
in
behind
him
with
excited
exclamations
as
the
men
saw
that
the
rider
reeled
in
his
saddle
his
face
haggard
and
drawn
with
pain
and
his
useless
left
arm
tied
to
his
side
but
barbara
still
turned
away
her
face
coming
so
close
that
his
leg
almost
touched
the
edge
of
the
platform
the
engineer
as
though
he
saw
no
one
but
her
held
out
the
black
leather
miss
worth
barbara
with
a
cry
she
turned
as
the
rider
sank
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
texas
reaching
out
lifted
him
bodily
from
the
saddle
to
the
platform
where
holmes
sank
unconscious
barbara
with
wonder
and
horror
in
her
face
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
while
pat
and
pablo
quickly
carried
the
still
form
of
the
engineer
into
the
building
unable
to
move
the
girl
followed
them
with
her
eyes
until
texas
who
had
caught
up
the
leather
exclaimed
with
an
oath
look
it
the
money
she
looked
at
him
as
though
she
did
not
comprehend
and
he
held
the
bundle
of
bills
toward
her
it
the
money
the
money
you
tell
them
mechanically
barbara
took
the
money
and
turned
to
the
crowd
that
stood
silently
wondering
what
it
all
meant
waiting
to
learn
whether
the
incident
had
anything
to
do
with
their
pay
under
the
powerful
light
she
held
up
her
two
hands
filled
with
bills
look
she
cried
look
here
is
the
money
for
your
pay
my
father
sent
it
now
will
you
believe
shouts
and
cheers
of
understanding
burst
from
the
crowd
it
is
for
you
that
it
is
here
continued
the
young
woman
will
you
go
away
now
and
come
back
in
the
morning
each
man
for
what
is
his
si
si
senorita
gracias
senorita
laughing
talking
and
gesticulating
the
crowd
dissolved
and
moved
away
before
the
dispersing
laborers
had
passed
beyond
the
circle
of
light
barbara
was
kneeling
beside
willard
holmes
and
when
they
would
have
taken
the
engineer
to
the
hotel
barbara
said
no
he
must
be
taken
to
her
home
texas
had
just
finished
dressing
with
rude
surgery
the
wound
in
the
engineer
shoulder
and
barbara
standing
by
the
bedside
was
looking
down
into
the
still
face
when
holmes
slowly
came
back
to
consciousness
his
opening
eyes
looked
up
full
into
the
brown
eyes
that
regarded
him
so
kindly
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
but
a
slow
flush
of
color
crept
into
the
girl
face
by
some
strange
freak
of
his
half
awakened
intellectual
faculties
holmes
was
living
over
again
the
incident
of
his
meeting
barbara
on
the
desert
the
morning
after
her
first
arrival
in
kingston
is
it
really
you
or
is
it
some
new
trick
of
this
confounded
desert
he
muttered
i
never
saw
a
mirage
like
this
before
i
do
think
the
heat
has
affected
my
brain
to
barbara
the
words
had
the
effect
of
suddenly
blotting
out
all
that
had
come
between
them
and
of
putting
them
both
back
again
to
the
day
when
they
had
started
square
so
she
answered
as
she
had
answered
then
i
assure
you
that
i
am
very
substantial
and
added
softly
and
i
am
here
to
stay
too
and
you
would
never
forgive
one
who
was
false
to
the
work
muttered
the
engineer
and
with
the
words
his
mind
caught
at
the
suggestion
of
the
power
that
had
enabled
him
to
keep
his
seat
in
the
saddle
through
the
seemingly
endless
hours
of
torture
and
he
remembered
everything
up
to
the
moment
when
he
had
handed
the
money
to
barbara
with
an
exclamation
he
tried
to
raise
himself
do
do
that
you
must
lie
still
holmes
said
the
young
woman
texas
and
pat
in
an
adjoining
room
heard
and
came
quickly
to
side
i
must
get
up
men
cried
holmes
appealingly
making
another
effort
to
raise
himself
we
must
go
for
abe
lee
he
hurt
alone
out
there
in
the
desert
why
do
you
move
miss
worth
please
texas
joe
quietly
forced
him
back
on
his
pillow
you
got
to
take
it
easy
for
a
little
while
holmes
get
a
grip
on
yourself
and
tell
us
plain
what
happened
we
move
fast
enough
when
we
know
which
way
to
go
when
holmes
had
told
them
briefly
the
story
of
the
fight
in
canyon
and
how
he
had
left
abe
at
wolf
wells
texas
said
now
holmes
you
just
keep
quiet
right
here
barbara
take
care
of
you
and
we
have
abe
home
before
noon
also
we
arrange
for
a
little
seance
with
them
greasers
what
put
you
and
abe
in
this
fix
an
hour
later
a
light
spring
wagon
with
four
horses
accompanied
by
a
party
of
five
mounted
men
moved
swiftly
out
of
republic
toward
the
south

on

abe
lee
waited
through
the
long
long
hours
of
the
night
for
the
morning
and
relief
at
times
the
wounded
surveyor
sank
into
half
unconsciousness
when
he
would
again
be
riding
riding
riding
toward
san
felipe
that
seemed
almost
so
far
away
that
he
could
never
hope
to
reach
the
end
of
his
journey
again
he
would
be
at
the
hotel
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
who
stared
at
him
curiously
as
the
clerk
explained
that
jefferson
worth
had
never
been
there
that
there
was
no
money
no
money
no
money
at
other
times
he
would
be
fighting
desperately
with
james
greenfield
for
the
possession
of
a
black
leather
secured
with
rubber
bands
or
with
the
company
engineer
would
face
a
crowd
of
mexicans
in
devil
canyon
in
such
numbers
that
he
could
not
count
them
but
could
only
fight
and
fight
and
fight
often
barbara
came
to
plead
with
him
to
save
her
from
some
terrible
danger
and
when
he
would
struggle
to
go
a
great
weight
held
him
down
and
he
could
not
and
the
brown
eyes
looked
at
him
full
of
pleading
reproach
then
he
would
curse
and
cry
aloud
as
willard
holmes
came
to
take
her
away
and
he
would
watch
the
two
riding
into
the
distance
through
the
green
fields
and
orchards
of
a
beautiful
land
in
their
happiness
forgetting
him
alone
in
the
desert
at
other
times
fully
conscious
he
lay
with
aching
body
and
that
sharp
pain
in
his
leg
looking
up
at
the
stars
calculating
the
time
and
the
distance
holmes
had
ridden
since
he
left
him
how
long
it
would
be
until
the
engineer
would
reach
republic
wondering
if
tex
and
pat
could
hold
the
strikers
or
if
already
it
was
too
late
then
again
when
his
mind
would
be
losing
its
grip
and
slipping
away
into
the
land
of
the
sounds
made
by
some
animal
at
the
water
hole
or
the
fancied
approach
of
the
mexicans
would
cause
him
to
start
into
keen
readiness
to
listen
and
watch
with
straining
sense
and
ready
weapon
at
last
all
knowledge
of
time
left
him
his
exhausted
nerves
and
muscles
no
longer
responded
to
suggestions
of
danger
his
brain
refused
to
act
a
soft
thick
cloud
of
darkness
that
was
not
the
darkness
of
the
night
settled
down
upon
him
enveloped
him
wrapped
him
as
in
a
sable
blanket
of
many
folds
thicker
and
thicker
blacker
and
blacker
feebly
he
struggled
against
it
for
a
little
then
with
a
sigh
yielded
and
lay
still
he
did
not
see
the
stars
pale
and
the
thin
streak
of
light
above
the
eastern
rim
of
the
basin
widen
into
the
morning
he
did
not
see
the
hills
all
rose
and
purple
develop
magically
against
the
sky
he
did
not
see
the
sun
burst
into
view
from
the
world
below
the
line
of
the
dun
plain
and
roll
its
flood
of
light
over
the
wide
desert
he
knew
nothing
more
until
someone
was
forcing
something
between
his
lips
and
a
grateful
stimulating
warmth
crept
through
his
veins
a
familiar
voice
drawled

in

an

yell

delight
from

greeted
his

the
grizzled
plainsman
with
a
smile
of
understanding
answered

made

as

chapter

barbara
ministers
to
the
wounded
willard
holmes
after
a
few
hours
of
refreshing
sleep
and
a
good
breakfast
prepared
and
served
by
his
hostess
with
her
own
hands
announced
himself
as
well
as
ever
but
you
need
some
fixing
just
the
same
declared
barbara
as
the
indian
woman
entered
the
room
carrying
warm
water
towels
and
bandages
while
the
young
woman
bent
over
the
engineer
and
with
firm
deft
fingers
removed
the
wrappings
from
his
shoulder
carefully
cleansed
the
wound
and
applied
fresh
dressing
and
clean
bandages
he
watched
her
face
so
near
his
own
and
wondered
that
he
had
ever
thought
her
plain
her
skin
warmly
browned
by
desert
sun
and
air
was
fresh
and
glowing
with
the
abundance
of
the
rich
red
life
in
her
veins
her
brown
hair
soft
and
wavy
tempted
him
to
reach
up
his
free
hand
and
put
back
a
rebellious
lock
he
moved
slightly
and
the
brown
eyes
full
of
womanly
pity
met
his
does
it
hurt
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
not
at
all
in
fact
i
think
i
rather
enjoy
it
her
cheeks
turned
a
deeper
red
and
he
felt
her
fingers
tremble
as
she
went
on
with
her
task
if
you
laugh
at
me
i
shall
turn
you
over
to
ynez
she
threatened
at
which
he
promised
so
pitifully
to
be
good
that
she
smiled
and
he
stirred
again
impatiently
i
hurting
you
she
cried
i
so
sorry
but
i
almost
through
there
now
she
finished
with
a
last
touch
and
straightening
put
back
herself
that
rebellious
lock
of
hair
as
she
stood
before
him
beautifully
strong
and
pure
and
fresh
and
clean
in
mind
and
heart
and
body
her
sweet
personality
the
spirit
of
her
complete
womanhood
swept
to
him
appealing
calling
exhilarating
invigorating
strengthening
as
he
had
often
felt
the
early
air
of
the
morning
sweeping
over
mountain
and
mesa
and
desert
plain
the
man
drew
a
long
deep
breath
tired
she
asked
softly
looking
down
upon
him
with
almost
a
look
in
her
eyes
heavens
no
he
exclaimed
his
voice
ringing
out
strongly
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
made
over
she
laughed
gladly
do
you
know
he
asked
earnestly
how
wonderful
you
are
nonsense
she
retorted
you
are
growing
delirious
you
must
be
quiet
i
going
to
leave
you
alone
for
a
little
while
now
and
you
must
sleep
she
followed
the
indian
woman
from
the
room
and
he
heard
her
voice
speaking
in
soft
musical
spanish
as
they
went
an
hour
later
barbara
moving
quietly
toward
his
room
to
see
if
he
was
asleep
or
wanted
anything
found
him
fully
dressed
in
a
big
easy
chair
in
the
living
room
oh
she
exclaimed
in
joyful
surprise
what
are
you
doing
out
here
i
thought
i
told
you
to
sleep
your
orders
were
inconsistent
he
returned
lazily
you
ca
cure
a
patient
and
still
continue
treating
him
as
if
he
were
an
invalid
i
do
need
sleep
i
need
bring
your
chair
and
sit
over
here
and
let
me
tell
you
what
i
need
he
finished
she
did
not
answer
but
going
to
his
room
returned
with
a
pillow
which
she
arranged
deftly
behind
his
head
then
kneeling
adjusted
the
foot
rest
of
the
reclining
chair
there
is
that
better
bring
your
chair
he
insisted
again
she
left
the
room
returning
this
time
with
a
bit
of
old
soft
muslin
drawing
her
easy
chair
to
a
position
facing
him
she
seated
herself
and
began
converting
the
material
in
her
hands
into
bandages
the
men
will
be
here
with
abe
any
time
now
she
explained
i
have
everything
ready
except
these
for
a
little
while
he
watched
her
in
silence
as
she
tore
the
white
cloth
into
long
strips
and
rolled
them
neatly
do
you
care
to
know
what
it
is
that
i
need
he
asked
at
last
she
bent
her
head
over
her
work
and
answered
softly
whenever
you
are
ready
to
tell
me
before
i
can
tell
you
i
must
know
something
carefully
she
rolled
another
white
strip
her
eyes
on
her
task
what
must
you
know
that
you
have
forgiven
me
the
color
rushed
into
her
cheeks
as
she
answered
do
you
know
that
but
i
must
hear
you
say
it
so
that
we
can
start
square
again
you
see
i
suppose
that
we
will
be
always
starting
over
again
wo
we
then
as
she
saw
his
face
she
added
quickly
i
mean
i
i
was
thinking
of
the
company
and
father
work
but
you
forgive
me
this
time
he
insisted
yes
i
forgive
you
and
i
am
glad
so
glad
that
i
can
and
we
are
square
again
yes
we
are
square
again
until
next
time
she
added
the
words
sadly
but
there
will
be
no
next
time
she
shook
her
head
with
a
doubtful
smile
the
company
will
make
a
time
he
laughed
aloud
with
a
sudden
sense
of
freedom
that
was
new
to
him
but
you
do
not
know
he
said
and
i
would
not
tell
you
until
we
were
square
again
i
am
not
with
the
company
now
she
dropped
her
roll
of
bandages
and
looked
at
him
not
with
the
company
when
did
you
resign
i
did
resign
they
discharged
me
discharged
you
yes
disgraceful
is
it
i
felt
pretty
bad
at
first
then
i
came
to
take
it
as
a
compliment
and
now
now
i
am
glad
then
he
told
her
why
greenfield
had
sent
for
him
how
he
had
met
the
seer
and
how
he
had
advised
cartwright
to
supply
the
money
her
father
needed
and
you
you
did
that
knowing
it
would
cost
you
your
position
she
exclaimed
oh
i
glad
that
was
fine
that
was
big
worthy
your
ancestors
in
her
interest
she
was
leaning
towards
him
with
flushed
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
and
her
voice
was
triumphant
as
if
in
some
subtle
way
she
was
vindicated
through
his
victory
the
engineer
felt
her
attitude
and
knew
that
she
was
right
it
her
victory
barbara
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
barbara
may
i
tell
you
now
what
it
is
that
i
need
before
she
could
answer
they
heard
a
team
and
wagon
coming
into
the
yard
beside
the
house
barbara
sprang
to
her
feet
it
is
the
men
with
abe
she
exclaimed
and
ran
out
of
the
room
on
to
the
porch
from
where
he
lay
in
his
chair
the
engineer
saw
through
the
open
door
pablo
and
pat
coming
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
carrying
the
surveyor
on
the
canvas
cot
and
barbara
with
mute
frightened
face
watching
the
two
men
with
their
burden
entered
the
room
followed
by
the
young
woman
and
carefully
lowered
the
cot
to
the
floor
the
long
form
of
the
surveyor
lay
motionless
his
eyes
closed
with
a
low
cry
barbara
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
the
cot
with
one
arm
across
the
still
form
of
the
only
brother
she
knew
and
the
other
pushing
back
the
rough
hair
from
his
forehead
she
bent
over
looking
appealingly
into
the
thin
rugged
face
her
own
face
alight
with
loving
anxiety
abe
abe
abe
she
called
softly
then
again
abe
see
dear
barbara
as
if
only
that
voice
had
power
to
call
him
back
the
man
eyes
opened
a
slow
smile
spread
over
his
unshaven
features
and
his
voice
expressed
glad
surprise
why
hello
barbara
willard
holmes
who
had
half
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
leaning
forward
watching
them
with
burning
interest
sank
back
with
a
groan
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
but
they
did
not
see
still
kneeling
barbara
took
a
glass
from
ynez
and
turned
again
to
the
injured
surveyor
here
abe
drink
this
the
irishman
lifted
him
in
his
huge
arms
and
he
obeyed
then
as
he
lay
looking
up
into
barbara
face
again
that
slow
smile
came
and
he
said
well
little
girl
holmes
made
it
did
he
that
buckskin
horse
of
tex
is
all
right
and
holmes
holmes
is
a
man
he
sure
made
good
how
is
he
holmes
rose
dizzily
and
came
forward
i
all
right
old
man
and
so
will
you
be
when
miss
worth
has
had
a
chance
at
you
quickly
the
surveyor
glanced
from
the
engineer
face
to
that
of
the
young
woman
whose
brown
eyes
still
regarded
him
with
loving
solicitude
i
reckon
you
right
he
said
slowly
then
barbara
directed
them
to
carry
him
into
the
room
she
had
prepared
while
willard
holmes
returned
to
his
chair
to
lie
with
closed
eyes
suffering
a
deeper
pain
than
the
pain
in
his
shoulder
when
his
wound
had
been
dressed
and
he
had
eaten
the
tempting
meal
barbara
brought
abe
fell
asleep
but
the
young
woman
would
not
leave
him
for
long
so
that
holmes
saw
very
little
of
her
all
the
rest
of
the
day
occasionally
she
would
run
into
the
room
where
the
engineer
lay
to
ask
if
he
needed
anything
but
only
for
a
moment
sometimes
seeing
him
so
still
she
thought
that
he
was
asleep
and
withdrew
softly
without
speaking
but
he
always
knew
the
next
morning
holmes
was
just
established
in
the
big
reclining
chair
in
the
living
room
when
a
peremptory
knock
called
barbara
to
the
front
door
it
was
james
greenfield
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
was
greatly
agitated
and
he
scarcely
noticed
the
young
woman
as
he
greeted
the
engineer
with
affectionate
regard
that
was
genuine
explaining
how
he
had
returned
to
kingston
the
night
before
and
learning
of
injury
that
morning
had
hurried
to
him
at
once
but
i
understand
he
exclaimed
half
angrily
how
ever
came
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
affair
when
i
missed
you
from
the
hotel
i
supposed
of
course
that
you
had
taken
the
train
back
to
kingston
and
came
on
expecting
to
find
you
there
what
on
earth
possessed
you
to
go
off
on
this
wild
ride
over
the
mountains
with
that
man
lee
you
might
have
been
killed
and
i
i
he
could
not
put
into
words
the
horrid
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
how
had
the
mexican
bullet
gone
true
he
himself
would
have
been
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
man
he
loved
as
his
own
son
holmes
understanding
the
man
thought
was
touched
by
the
capitalist
unusual
agitation
and
for
the
moment
did
not
attempt
to
reply
then
with
an
attempt
at
lightness
he
said
oh
well
it
all
coming
out
right
uncle
jim
thanks
to
miss
worth
care
i
am
nearly
well
now
the
wound
really
did
amount
to
much
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
barbara
and
the
older
man
also
turned
quickly
toward
the
young
woman
who
at
the
engineer
words
was
blushing
rosy
red
father
and
i
owe
holmes
a
debt
we
can
never
pay
she
said
quietly
then
excusing
herself
on
the
plea
that
her
other
patient
needed
her
she
left
the
room
when
the
two
men
had
watched
her
go
greenfield
said
gently
this
is
a
bad
business
willard
a
damned
bad
business
i
admit
that
i
was
angry
when
you
turned
against
us
in
that
cartwright
deal
but
confound
it
boy
i
admire
you
for
it
just
the
same
your
father
would
have
done
just
as
you
did
it
was
that
finer
kind
of
honesty
that
made
him
a
failure
in
the
business
where
the
rest
of
us
made
fortunes
but
we
all
loved
him
for
it
and
your
mother
he
looked
away
through
the
window
toward
the
distant
mountains
you
understand
do
you
willard
that
i
was
forced
to
let
you
go
when
you
turned
the
company
down
my
directors
would
never
stand
for
anything
else
you
know
you
do
feel
hard
toward
me
lad
because
i
had
to
let
you
out
certainly
not
uncle
jim
i
was
hurt
just
at
first
but
when
i
had
taken
time
to
think
it
over
i
did
not
blame
you
you
are
sure
willard
sure
uncle
jim
the
older
man
was
studying
the
engineer
face
intently
i
do
know
what
it
is
willard
but
something
has
changed
you
since
you
came
into
this
country
you
know
my
boy
that
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
but
you
all
that
i
have
will
be
yours
i
have
dreamed
and
planned
for
you
as
for
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
am
telling
you
this
now
because
i
have
felt
that
something
was
taking
you
away
from
me
something
that
i
can
not
understand
has
come
between
us
i
felt
it
the
moment
i
met
you
in
kingston
and
it
has
been
growing
ever
since
it
was
that
that
made
me
so
angry
over
the
cartwright
business
you
know
how
i
hate
the
west
you
know
what
it
cost
me
years
ago
i
feel
now
that
in
some
way
i
am
losing
you
too
what
is
it
willard
that
has
come
between
us
clean
it
up
and
get
back
in
our
relations
to
where
we
were
before
we
left
home
as
james
greenfield
made
his
appeal
the
engineer
eyes
turned
involuntarily
toward
the
door
through
which
barbara
had
left
the
room
and
when
he
did
not
answer
immediately
the
older
man
was
sure
that
he
understood
what
it
was
that
had
come
between
himself
and
the
son
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
why
holmes
had
used
his
influence
in
behalf
of
jefferson
worth
is
it
that
girl
willard
the
younger
man
faced
him
squarely
and
his
answer
meant
much
more
to
the
engineer
himself
than
he
could
have
explained
to
greenfield
yes
sir
it
is
this
girl
you
love
her
as
my
father
must
have
loved
my
mother
at
the
simple
words
greenfield
controlled
himself
but
his
hatred
for
jefferson
worth
was
very
bitter
that
he
should
fail
to
win
in
the
business
warfare
with
the
western
man
was
nothing
but
that
worth
through
his
daughter
should
rob
him
of
the
son
that
was
more
than
a
son
to
him
was
more
than
he
could
bear
but
my
dear
boy
he
said
think
what
this
means
think
of
your
family
of
your
father
and
mother
of
your
friends
and
your
future
back
home
who
are
these
people
they
are
nobodies
this
man
worth
is
an
ignorant
illiterate
common
boor
with
no
breeding
no
education
nothing
but
a
certain
native
cunning
that
has
enabled
him
to
make
a
little
money
we
have
nothing
in
common
with
his
class
worth
is
an
honest
honorable
man
who
is
doing
a
great
work
answered
holmes
stoutly
and
his
daughter
is
uncle
jim
she
is
the
most
wonderful
woman
i
ever
knew
as
willard
holmes
spoke
barbara
coming
from
the
kitchen
into
the
dining
room
could
not
help
hearing
the
words
that
came
through
the
partly
opened
door
of
the
living
room
where
the
men
were
talking
involuntarily
at
the
sound
of
the
engineer
voice
the
red
blood
crept
into
the
young
woman
face
and
her
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
the
next
moment
greenfield
voice
held
her
motionless
but
do
you
know
that
she
is
not
worth
daughter
not
his
daughter
exclaimed
holmes
no
not
his
daughter
she
is
a
nameless
waif
whom
he
picked
up
and
adopted
no
one
knows
her
parentage
not
even
her
name
she
may
even
have
mexican
or
indian
blood
in
her
veins
for
all
that
anyone
knows
it
was
not
strange
that
willard
holmes
had
never
heard
the
story
of
how
barbara
was
found
in
the
desert
in
the
new
country
where
most
of
the
engineer
life
in
the
west
had
been
spent
comparatively
few
beyond
worth
most
intimate
associates
knew
that
she
was
the
daughter
only
by
adoption
greenfield
who
had
learned
the
story
while
inquiring
for
business
reasons
into
the
history
of
his
competitor
told
the
young
man
briefly
of
the
finding
of
the
unknown
child
do
you
see
my
boy
finished
the
financier
how
impossible
it
is
that
you
should
give
your
name
one
of
the
oldest
and
best
in
the
history
of
the
country
to
a
nameless
woman
of
unknown
breeding
whose
connection
with
this
man
worth
even
is
merely
accidental
it
would
ruin
you
willard
think
of
your
friends
back
home
how
would
they
receive
her
think
of
me
of
my
plans
for
you
i
i
should
feel
that
i
had
been
false
to
your
mother
willard
who
gave
you
to
me
on
her
if
i
permitted
such
a
thing
as
this
it
it
monstrous
slowly
the
engineer
raised
his
head
and
with
a
smile
on
his
white
face
that
hurt
the
older
man
he
said
i
can
at
least
relieve
your
mind
on
that
score
uncle
jim
you
need
not
fear
that
i
will
marry
miss
worth
at
his
words
from
beyond
that
partly
closed
door
barbara
made
her
way
blindly
to
her
own
room
and
throwing
herself
face
downward
on
her
couch
strove
with
clenched
hands
and
throbbing
veins
to
keep
her
self
control
she
must
not
she
must
not
let
them
know
she
whispered
to
herself
moaning
in
pain
she
must
go
to
them
again
in
a
moment
and
they
must
not
know
while
the
woman
whom
willard
holmes
loved
fought
for
strength
to
hide
her
pain
james
greenfield
in
the
other
room
was
leaning
eagerly
toward
the
engineer
she
has
refused
you
i
have
not
asked
her
but
do
misunderstand
me
what
you
have
told
me
what
my
friends
at
home
might
think
or
do
could
make
no
difference
barbara
worth
is
worthy
any
man
love
and
i
love
her
and
would
make
her
my
wife
i
would
give
up
even
you
for
her
uncle
jim
it
not
that
it
because
i
know
that
she
loves
someone
else
too
well
to
listen
to
me
chapter
xxxiii
willard
holmes
receives
his
answer
when
barbara
returned
to
the
living
room
with
some
trivial
excuse
to
explain
her
rather
long
absence
she
found
holmes
determined
to
go
with
greenfield
to
his
rooms
in
the
hotel
in
kingston
when
she
protested
he
answered
really
miss
worth
my
shoulder
troubles
me
so
little
that
i
am
ashamed
to
offer
myself
as
an
invalid
and
now
that
uncle
jim
is
with
me
i
have
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
burdening
you
any
longer
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
made
you
feel
that
you
were
a
burden
she
returned
with
a
brave
smile
he
answered
warmly
you
know
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
never
greenfield
too
expressed
his
appreciation
of
her
kindness
but
she
answered
the
engineer
as
if
she
had
not
heard
the
older
man
and
i
can
never
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
us
as
they
stood
on
the
porch
while
greenfield
went
on
ahead
to
the
buggy
holmes
held
out
his
hand
and
we
are
square
again
yes
we
are
square
then
adios
senorita
adios
amigo
bravely
she
stood
watching
until
the
carriage
disappeared
down
the
street
then
she
went
slowly
into
the
house
to
abe
room
the
surveyor
lay
propped
up
in
bed
with
pillows
looking
quite
cheerful
well
sister
was
his
greeting
you
have
lost
one
patient
and
you
are
going
to
lose
the
other
one
before
long
i
feel
like
a
new
man
already
for
a
little
she
made
no
answer
and
as
she
stood
before
him
silent
those
eyes
that
were
trained
to
let
nothing
escape
their
notice
studied
her
face
and
noted
her
hands
clasped
in
nervous
pain
why
barbara
what
is
it
sister
what
has
gone
wrong
at
his
words
the
brown
eyes
filled
barbara
she
dropped
into
the
chair
by
the
bedside
and
throwing
herself
toward
him
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
in
the
pillow
by
his
side
her
form
shaking
with
sobs
the
surveyor
face
was
white
now
under
its
bronze
white
and
set
lightly
he
placed
his
hand
upon
the
soft
brown
hair
so
near
his
shoulder
and
his
eyes
seemed
now
to
be
looking
far
away
when
her
grief
had
spent
itself
a
little
he
said
quietly
do
you
think
sister
that
you
had
better
tell
me
about
this
when
she
did
not
answer
he
said
again
gently
do
you
care
for
him
so
much
barbara
the
brown
head
nodded
her
confession
and
for
a
moment
the
man
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
away
his
face
then
wo
you
let
me
help
you
slowly
with
many
pauses
she
told
him
what
she
had
overheard
when
she
had
finished
abe
said
simply
but
he
has
not
told
you
of
his
love
barbara
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
no
abe
i
not
mistaken
he
has
not
told
me
not
in
words
but
i
know
i
know
then
said
the
surveyor
he
will
tell
you
listen
barbara
the
man
who
went
through
those
mexicans
in
devil
canyon
with
me
is
not
the
kind
of
a
man
who
gives
up
the
woman
he
loves
for
what
others
think
wait
a
little
dear
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
you
have
been
too
quick
be
patient
a
little
and
you
shall
see
but
abe
greenfield
is
right
i
am
a
nameless
nobody
and
he
he
is
he
is
a
man
and
you
are
a
woman
and
this
is
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
where
nothing
else
matters
said
abe
lee
almost
sternly
a
few
minutes
later
when
barbara
was
gone
the
surveyor
slipped
lower
on
the
pillows
and
wearily
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
several
times
that
day
barbara
looked
in
on
him
and
at
last
when
he
had
not
moved
for
so
long
called
him
softly
he
answered
with
a
smile
but
when
she
had
arranged
his
pillows
for
him
he
closed
his
eyes
again
with
a
word
of
thanks
jefferson
worth
arrived
that
evening
and
with
him
came
the
seer
who
had
joined
him
in
the
city
by
the
sea
but
barbara
joy
at
their
coming
was
overshadowed
by
her
anxiety
for
abe
who
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
condition
that
was
alarming
when
they
entered
his
room
the
surveyor
who
still
lay
with
his
face
to
the
wall
did
not
look
up
daddy
is
here
abe
said
barbara
daddy
and
the
seer
slowly
the
man
turned
toward
them
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
word
of
greeting
for
each
i
mighty
glad
you
have
come
he
added
barbara
has
had
rather
more
than
her
hands
full
but
the
old
engineer
noticed
that
he
did
not
look
at
barbara
as
he
spoke
while
the
three
were
at
supper
barbara
told
the
men
the
whole
story
and
when
they
had
finished
the
meal
the
seer
said
now
jeff
i
know
you
have
important
business
needing
your
immediate
attention
and
our
girl
here
must
have
a
good
night
rest
she
has
been
through
enough
to
kill
an
average
woman
i
going
to
take
care
of
abe
myself
when
his
old
chief
was
alone
with
the
surveyor
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
bedside
and
sat
for
some
time
looking
at
the
man
on
the
bed
then
he
said
i
think
son
that
you
and
i
had
better
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
first
i
have
a
look
at
that
leg
when
the
examination
was
over
the
big
man
eyed
the
surveyor
humph
this
is
not
a
scratch
beside
what
that
greaser
did
to
you
with
his
knife
in
arizona
you
did
even
stop
work
for
that
your
ride
to
san
felipe
and
back
ordinarily
would
call
for
about
twelve
hours
sleep
and
that
all
come
lad
what
the
matter
out
with
it
abe
smiled
i
down
and
out
i
reckon
down
and
out
hell
returned
the
big
man
that
wo
do
abe
you
forget
that
you
are
talking
to
me
then
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
i
know
what
it
is
my
boy
it
barbara
by
the
pain
in
the
surveyor
eyes
the
seer
knew
that
he
was
right
then
the
seer
in
his
own
way
did
for
abe
what
abe
had
done
for
barbara
when
the
young
woman
brought
in
his
breakfast
the
next
morning
abe
greeted
her
with
his
old
cheery
hello
and
declared
facetiously
that
the
seer
had
talked
him
into
a
sleep
from
which
he
had
awakened
as
hungry
as
a
bear
and
ready
to
go
to
work
two
days
later
texas
joe
who
had
ridden
in
from
somewhere
late
the
night
before
came
to
report
we
were
beginning
to
think
that
you
were
not
coming
back
at
all
uncle
tex
said
barbara
who
with
the
others
was
curious
to
hear
of
the
adventure
i
once
mebbe
i
would
come
back
no
more
neither
he
drawled
you
see
worth
after
got
abe
at
wolf
wells
i
figured
that
bein
so
far
on
the
way
i
might
as
well
go
on
over
to
felipe
get
that
ol
buckskin
hawss
o
mine
what
abe
had
left
he
paused
and
turning
his
head
to
one
side
looked
meditatively
down
at
the
spur
on
his
boot
that
there
buckskin
is
sure
some
hawss
barbara
he
sure
is
did
you
get
him
asked
barbara
texas
looked
up
mildly
surprised
sure
we
got
him
that
what
you
then
he
laughed
softly
as
though
mildly
amused
at
some
incident
suddenly
remembered
abe
you
know
that
greaser
that
tumbled
into
the
dry
river
spillway
when
was
puttin
in
number
five
gate
yes
i
you
know
him
i
heard
somethin
funny
about
him
when
i
was
in
san
felipe
after
that
buckskin
what
was
it
texas
he
daid
the
recovery
of
the
two
wounded
men
was
rapid
for
a
while
holmes
came
over
from
kingston
every
day
to
see
lee
and
the
two
with
the
seer
and
barbara
spent
many
delightful
hours
on
the
big
front
porch
jefferson
worth
enterprises
pushed
steadily
toward
completion
the
power
plant
in
barba
was
finished
and
the
king
basin
central
had
stretched
its
steel
length
from
the
junction
at
republic
to
within
three
miles
of
the
terminal
when
abe
was
able
to
go
back
to
his
work
holmes
did
not
go
so
often
to
the
worth
home
but
the
presence
of
the
seer
still
enabled
him
to
excuse
to
himself
his
quite
frequent
visits
but
while
the
young
engineer
continually
sought
the
seer
not
only
because
of
their
growing
friendship
but
because
he
was
always
sure
of
meeting
barbara
he
avoided
seeing
the
girl
alone
for
he
felt
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
and
the
young
woman
feeling
his
attitude
toward
her
was
convinced
against
her
will
and
abe
protest
that
the
man
who
loved
her
guarded
himself
against
her
for
the
reasons
that
she
had
overheard
greenfield
urge
upon
him
then
holmes
received
a
letter
from
the
southwestern
and
continental
railroad
company
offering
him
a
position
that
would
place
him
at
the
head
of
the
engineering
department
of
the
district
that
included
the
king
basin
the
letter
stated
that
the
position
was
tendered
on
recommendation
of
jefferson
worth
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
flood
season
was
at
hand
and
that
conditions
seriously
threatening
to
the
company
property
might
be
expected
at
any
hour
urged
him
to
accept
by
wire
and
take
charge
immediately
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
a
sudden
desire
to
go
with
it
to
barbara
mastered
him
he
knew
that
the
seer
had
planned
to
go
that
morning
with
abe
lee
to
barba
and
that
the
young
woman
was
alone
an
hour
later
he
dismounted
in
front
of
the
worth
home
barbara
herself
met
him
at
the
door
the
seer
is
not
at
home
she
said
as
they
entered
the
living
room
i
thought
you
knew
i
did
not
come
to
see
the
seer
i
came
to
see
you
he
answered
bluntly
to
see
me
yes
to
ask
you
how
i
shall
answer
this
he
handed
her
the
letter
she
read
it
slowly
gaining
time
for
but
i
do
not
understand
why
you
should
come
to
me
he
studied
her
face
a
moment
before
he
answered
how
could
he
explain
to
her
the
impulse
that
had
prompted
him
as
every
man
is
prompted
to
take
the
big
things
of
his
life
to
the
one
woman
who
if
she
be
really
the
one
woman
for
him
is
more
than
all
i
thought
i
hoped
that
you
would
be
interested
he
said
and
i
am
she
cried
eagerly
feeling
that
which
he
could
not
put
into
words
of
course
i
interested
i
was
only
surprised
that
you
should
hesitate
a
moment
to
accept
do
you
want
to
continue
your
work
do
you
want
to
stay
with
us
she
added
the
last
words
wistfully
and
the
heart
of
the
man
longed
to
tell
her
that
which
she
longed
to
hear
yes
he
said
slowly
i
want
to
stay
but
i
i
am
afraid
the
words
slipped
out
unbidden
barbara
interpreted
his
answer
in
the
light
of
his
conversation
with
greenfield
which
she
had
overheard
and
her
woman
pride
was
aroused
he
should
be
made
to
understand
that
he
was
in
no
danger
from
her
her
next
words
were
a
challenge
afraid
of
what
afraid
of
you
he
burst
forth
savagely
afraid
of
myself
because
i
love
you
from
the
first
day
when
you
showed
me
the
desert
you
have
been
so
closely
associated
in
my
mind
with
this
work
that
i
can
not
think
of
it
without
thinking
of
you
everything
i
have
done
i
have
felt
was
done
for
you
i
would
have
given
it
all
up
a
hundred
times
but
my
thoughts
of
you
would
not
let
me
when
i
have
been
untrue
to
the
work
i
have
felt
that
i
have
been
untrue
to
you
if
i
have
accomplished
any
good
here
it
has
been
through
you
everywhere
i
have
gone
in
this
country
you
have
seemed
to
me
to
be
there
everything
i
see
speaks
to
me
of
you
the
desert
the
mountains
the
farms
and
homes
and
towns
it
is
all
you
and
you
and
you
i
did
not
realize
it
at
first
but
i
felt
it
and
then
as
i
came
to
love
my
work
i
came
to
love
you
i
did
not
intend
to
tell
you
this
i
hate
myself
for
telling
you
but
i
love
you
i
love
you
do
you
understand
now
why
i
came
to
you
with
this
letter
do
you
understand
why
i
am
afraid
to
stay
at
the
man
passionate
outburst
that
came
as
if
dragged
from
him
against
his
will
barbara
shrank
back
as
if
he
threatened
her
he
had
not
asked
if
she
loved
him
he
had
only
spoken
brutally
savagely
of
his
passion
for
her
she
repeated
insistently
blindly
to
herself
he
must
not
know
he
must
not
know
the
man
spoke
again
forgive
me
miss
worth
i
did
not
mean
to
let
go
of
myself
i
know
how
you
love
this
work
how
hard
you
have
tried
to
hold
me
true
to
it
i
could
not
bear
that
you
should
think
of
me
as
leaving
it
without
reason
but
you
see
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
now
for
me
to
stay
as
he
spoke
a
running
horse
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
the
house
and
through
the
open
door
they
saw
pablo
leap
from
the
saddle
and
run
swiftly
up
the
walk
toward
the
house
senorita
the
mexican
cried
as
barbara
sprang
towards
him
the
river
the
river
it
has
come
the
company
works
it
is
all
gone
senor
worth
send
me
quick
to
tell

say

way

to

think

know
where

he
turned
to
the
engineer
senor
holmes
the
river
has
come
again
into
la
palma
de
la

de

like
the
indians
say
it
was
long
time
ago
senor
worth
say
you
come
please
pronto
barbara
wheeled
on
the
engineer
with
flushed
cheeks
and
blazing
eyes
this
is
your
answer
she
cried
not
for
me
not
for
yourself
but
for
the
work
work
work
for
an
instant
he
looked
into
her
eyes
then
turned
and
ran
towards
his
horse
with
pablo
at
his
heels
barbara
saw
them
spring
into
their
saddles
and
disappear
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
the
engineer
as
he
rode
remembered
what
abe
lee
had
once
told
him
of
pablo
saying
in
the
company
there
is
no
senorita
chapter
xxxiv
battling
with
the
river
some
day
perhaps
the
history
of
that
river
war
will
be
written
it
can
only
be
suggested
in
my
story
it
was
a
war
of
terrific
forces
waged
for
a
great
cause
by
men
as
brave
as
any
who
ever
fought
with
weapons
that
kill
the
attacking
force
was
the
rio
colorado
that
with
power
immeasurable
had
through
the
ages
past
carved
canyons
on
its
course
and
with
its
mountains
of
silt
had
built
the
great
delta
dam
across
the
ancient
gulf
thus
turning
back
the
waters
of
the
sea
that
sun
and
wind
might
lay
bare
the
floor
of
the
basin
and
work
the
desolation
of
the
desert
using
the
seer
open
hand
for
his
map
of
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
jose
the
indian
had
traced
the
course
of
the
river
along
the
base
of
the
fingers
flowing
toward
the
gulf
which
lies
between
the
edge
of
the
palm
and
the
thumb
this
same
inner
edge
of
the
hand
representing
roughly
the
high
ground
that
shuts
out
the
waters
of
the
sea
the
thousands
of
acres
of
the
king
basin
lands
lie
from
sea
level
to
nearly
three
hundred
feet
below
the
river
at
the
point
where
the
intake
for
the
system
of
canals
was
located
is
of
course
higher
than
sea
level
for
the
waters
that
pass
the
intake
flow
on
southward
to
the
gulf
it
was
the
river
flowing
thus
on
higher
ground
that
made
irrigation
and
reclamation
of
the
desert
possible
it
was
this
also
that
made
possible
the
disaster
that
was
now
upon
the
hardy
pioneers
who
had
staked
everything
in
their
effort
to
realize
the
vast
potential
wealth
of
the
ancient
the
grade
from
the
river
at
the
intake
to
the
lowest
point
in
the
bottom
of
the
basin
is
much
steeper
than
the
established
fall
of
the
river
from
the
intake
to
the
gulf
the
water
in
the
canals
on
this
steeper
grade
was
controlled
by
headings
spillways
gates
and
drops
while
the
structure
at
the
intake
with
gates
to
regulate
the
flow
into
the
main
canal
prevented
the
river
from
leaving
its
old
channel
altogether
pouring
its
entire
volume
into
the
basin
and
in
time
converting
it
again
into
an
inland
sea
the
dangerously
cheap
and
inadequate
character
of
the
vital
parts
built
by
the
company
upon
the
usual
promoter
estimates
had
led
abe
lee
to
protest
against
the
risk
forced
upon
the
settlers
and
had
finally
caused
him
to
resign
later
as
the
company
system
of
canals
was
extended
and
more
and
more
water
was
needed
to
supply
the
rapidly
increasing
acreage
of
cultivated
lands
willard
holmes
came
to
appreciate
the
surveyor
view
of
the
danger
and
insistently
urged
his
employers
to
supply
him
with
funds
to
replace
the
temporary
wooden
structures
with
safe
and
lasting
works
of
concrete
and
steel
but
the
hunger
of
capital
for
profits
forbade
some
day
the
work
would
be
done
the
directors
promised
in
the
meantime
without
increasing
the
original
investment
by
so
much
as
a
dollar
but
with
the
revenues
derived
from
the
sale
of
water
rights
they
were
extending
the
system
to
supply
the
ever
increasing
fields
of
the
settlers
thus
shrewdly
forcing
the
people
who
were
ignorant
of
the
terrible
risk
they
were
carrying
to
supply
the
funds
to
build
the
canals
and
ditches
that
belonged
to
the
company
while
for
the
water
carried
to
the
ranches
the
farmers
continued
to
pay
the
company
large
rentals
the
original
investment
of
the
company
was
very
small
compared
with
the
thousands
invested
by
the
pioneers
who
had
been
induced
to
settle
in
the
new
country
and
yet
from
every
dollar
of
the
wealth
taken
from
the
land
the
company
would
receive
a
share
but
the
rio
colorado
gave
no
heed
to
the
decree
of
the
new
york
financiers
the
forces
that
had
made

willard
holmes
who
had
come
to
understand
that
his
work
was
not
alone
to
safeguard
the
property
of
his
employers
but
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
pioneers
as
well
had
been
discharged
because
he
would
not
deliver
the
people
wholly
into
the
hands
of
the
company
a
new
engineer
out
of
the
east
as
faithful
to
the
interests
of
capital
as
he
was
unfamiliar
with
conditions
in
the
new
country
was
placed
in
charge
it
was
as
if
the
river
in
the
absence
of
the
man
whose
constant
readiness
had
held
it
in
check
saw
its
opportunity
swiftly
it
mustered
its
forces
from
mountain
and
plain
hundreds
of
miles
away
it
gathered
its
strength
and
hurried
to
the
assault
the
sources
of

established
by

lay
on
his
desk
unnoticed
burk
warned
him
but
the
thoughtful
manager
of
the
company
was
not
an
engineer
willard
holmes
tried
to
help
him
but
holmes
had
been
discharged
by
the
company
and
the
words
of
discharged
men
have
little
weight
with
those
who
succeed
to
their
positions
the
daily
reports
from
the
gauge
at
rubio
city
showed
an
increase
in
the
river
volume
of
twenty
thousand
second
feet
then
thirty
thousand
more
and
on
top
of
that
came
another
twenty
thousand
the
assistants
of
the
new
chief
engineer
tried
to
tell
him
what
it
meant
but
the
assistants
were
subordinates
and
friends
of
willard
holmes
the
man
from
new
york
who
was
privileged
to
write
several
letters
after
his
name
was
supposed
to
know
his
business
then
the
assembled
forces
of
the
river
reached
the
intake
and
the
trembling
wooden
structures
that
stood
between
the
pioneers
and
ruin
besieged
by
the
rising
flood
battered
by
the
swirling
currents
bombarded
by
drift
gave
way
under
the
strain
and
the
charging
waters
plunged
through
the
breach
too
late
the
company
forces
were
rushed
to
the
scene
before
their
very
eyes
the
roaring
waters
as
if
mad
with
destructive
power
wrenched
and
tore
at
the
company
property
twisting
ripping
smashing
until
not
a
trestle
plank
or
stick
was
left
in
place
and
the
terrific
current
rushing
with
ever
increasing
volume
and
power
through
the
opening
plowed
into
the
soft
alluvial
soil
of
the
embankment
undermining
and
carrying
it
away
until
nearly
the
entire
river
was
admitted
as
quickly
as
men
and
material
could
be
assembled
the
company
chief
engineer
began
the
battle
to
regain
control
of
the
mighty
stream
the
warfare
thus
begun
meant
life
or
death
to
the
greatest
reclamation
project
in
the
world
millions
already
invested
by
the
settlers
in
farms
and
towns
and
homes
and
business
enterprises
were
at
stake
many
more
millions
that
were
yet
to
be
realized
from
the
reclaimed
lands
depended
upon
the
issue
of
the
fight
against
the
efforts
of
the
engineers
and
the
army
of
laborers
the
river
massed
from
its
tributaries
in
the
regions
of
heavy
rains
and
melting
snows
the
greatest
strength
it
had
assembled
in
many
years
five
times
with
piling
and
trestles
and
jetties
and
embankments
the
men
who
defended
the
king
basin
were
in
sight
of
victory
five
times
the
river
summoned
fresh
strength
twisted
out
the
piling
wrecked
the
trestles
undermined
the
jetties
and
embankments
and
swept
the
nearly
completed
structures
smashing
grinding
crashing
away
a
twisted
tangled
ruin
while
the
engineers
and
men
of
the
company
were
waging
this
war
with
the
river
the
situation
of
the
pioneers
in
the
basin
grew
daily
more
perilous
without
a
channel
large
enough
to
carry
the
incoming
stream
the
flood
spread
over
a
wide
territory
in
the
southern
and
western
portions
of
the
basin
filling
first
the
old
channels
and
washes
left
by
the
waters
ages
ago
forming
next
in
the
areas
of
nearly
level
or
slightly
depressed
sections
shallow
pools
lakes
and
seas
out
of
which
the
higher
ground
and
hummocks
rose
like
islands
growing
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
rising
tide
submerged
more
and
more
of
their
sandy
bases
meanwhile
the
whole
flood
eddying
slowly
with
winding
sluggish
currents
in
the
shallow
places
moving
more
swiftly
in
the
deeper
washes
and
channels
swept
always
onward
toward
the
north
where
miles
away
lay
the
deepest
bottom
of
the
great
basin
many
of
the
settlers
in
the
flooded
districts
were
forced
to
abandon
farms
they
had
won
with
courage
and
toil
for
the
sweeping
waters
covered
alike
fields
of
alfalfa
and
grain
and
barren
desert
waste
the
towns
of
frontera
and
kingston
were
protected
from
the
inundation
by
earthen
levees
in
the
building
of
which
men
and
women
toiled
in
desperate
haste
and
night
and
day
these
embankments
were
patrolled
by
watchful
guards
who
frequently
summoned
the
weary
besieged
citizens
from
their
rest
to
protect
or
strengthen
some
threatened
point
in
their
fortifications
the
eastern
side
of
the
basin
being
higher
ground
the
settlers
in
the
south
central
district
and
east
of
republic
with
the
two
towns
built
by
jefferson
worth
were
in
no
immediate
danger
but
the
old
dry
river
channel
became
a
roaring
torrent
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
if
the
river
were
not
controlled
when
every
foot
of
the
new
country
with
its
wealth
of
improvements
and
its
vast
possibilities
would
be
buried
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
an
inland
sea
the
situation
was
appalling
the
remarkable
development
of
the
new
country
the
marvelous
richness
of
the
reclaimed
lands
with
the
immense
possibilities
of
the
reclamation
work
as
demonstrated
by
the
king
basin
project
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
nation
the
pioneers
in
barbara
desert
were
in
fact
leaders
in
a
far
greater
work
that
would
add
immeasurably
to
the
nation
life
that
would
indeed
be
in
its
influence
because
of
this
the
attention
of
the
nation
was
fixed
with
peculiar
interest
upon
the
disaster
that
had
fallen
upon
the
king
basin
throughout
the
land
civil
engineers
watched
intently
the
efforts
of
the
company
men
to
regain
control
of
the
river
and
to
force
it
back
into
its
old
channel
many
declared
that
because
of
the
alluvial
character
of
the
soil
the
absence
of
anything
like
a
rock
floor
to
build
upon
and
the
great
volume
and
terrific
velocity
of
the
current
the
feat
was
an
engineering
impossibility
in
the
eyes
of
the
engineering
world
the
king
basin
project
was
doomed
the
settlers
were
advised
to
abandon
the
work
they
had
accomplished
and
to
move
out
but
those
strong
ones
who
had
forced
the
desert
to
yield
its
wealth
to
their
hands
did
not
move
those
whose
farms
were
in
the
flooded
district
were
forced
to
go
there
was
the
inevitable
sifting
of
the
and
the
weak
but
the
great
majority
stood
fast
jefferson
worth
in
the
face
of
almost
certain
ruin
went
steadily
on
with
his
work
on
the
railroad
and
continued
pushing
his
other
enterprises
toward
completion
making
improvements
erecting
new
buildings
planning
further
investments
and
developments
with
a
confidence
and
conviction
that
was
startling
not
once
throughout
that
trying
period
was
he
heard
to
express
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
settlers
his
business
friends
and
associates
outside
urged
him
to
stop
to
wait
at
least
until
the
issue
was
certain
he
answered
calmly
that
the
issue
was
already
certain
and
went
on
with
his
work
his
confidence
and
courage
were
the
inspiration
that
fired
the
hearts
of
that
threatened
people
had
he
given
ground
had
he
weakened
and
drawn
back
it
would
have
started
a
panic
that
nothing
could
have
checked
and
that
would
have
resulted
inevitably
in
the
abandonment
of
the
cause
forever
the
king
basin
lands
with
the
wealth
of
effort
that
had
already
been
expended
would
have
been
given
over
to
the
river
lost
irretrievably
to
the
race
hundreds
went
to
him
when
they
felt
their
courage
failing
and
their
spirits
weakening
under
the
strain
and
always
they
returned
to
their
farms
or
to
their
business
with
renewed
strength
to
go
on
as
one
who
passed
through
that
ordeal
long
afterwards
expressed
it
in
those
times
we
all
just
lived
on
his
nerve
through
all
the
company
war
with
the
river
and
its
repeated
defeats
willard
holmes
was
forced
to
stand
a
mere
observer
an
idle
foreseeing
the
catastrophe
that
was
now
upon
them
he
had
prepared
himself
by
careful
study
of
every
factor
in
the
problem
and
by
thorough
knowledge
of
the
situation
to
meet
the
crisis
when
it
came
with
every
means
at
his
command
he
had
planned
and
worked
that
he
might
be
ready
and
so
far
as
possible
equipped
for
the
struggle
and
now
when
war
was
declared
and
the
battle
being
waged
he
could
only
watch
the
ruin
of
the
work
he
loved
while
a
stranger
who
ignored
his
preparatory
efforts
took
the
place
that
should
have
been
his
but
the
great
man
of
the
with
whom
the
engineer
had
many
a
counsel
in
those
days
warned
him
always
to
be
ready
for
the
time
when
as
the
western
man
put
it
the
company
should
throw
up
its
hands
the
waters
moving
northward
reached
the
lowest
point
in
the
basin
and
there
formed
an
inland
sea
that
without
an
outlet
and
receiving
the
full
volume
of
the
river
grew
ever
larger
and
larger
flowing
towards
the
sea
the
flood
developed
swift
currents
in
the
depressions
and
washes
that
led
in
the
general
direction
of
its
course
seeking
thus
to
make
for
itself
a
channel
the
largest
of
these
ancient
washes
scarcely
noticeable
in
the
desert
led
from
the
south
to
kingston
passing
through
the
edge
of
the
town
curved
slightly
to
the
west
and
extended
on
northward
becoming
deeper
and
more
clearly
defined
with
higher
ground
on
either
side
as
it
neared
the
lowest
point
of
the
basin
the
general
lay
of
the
land
drew
the
flood
toward
this
channel
and
developed
a
current
that
moved
with
increasing
velocity
as
the
waters
nearing
the
sea
were
concentrated
more
and
more
by
the
greater
depth
of
the
old
channel
and
the
steeper
grade
of
the
land
on
both
sides
then
a
new
and
alarming
phase
of
the
river
destructive
work
developed
and
everyone
saw
that
the
war
at
the
intake
must
be
forced
to
a
speedy
finish
or
the
cause
would
be
lost
the
immense
volume
of
water
flowing
with
increased
strength
and
velocity
as
it
defined
for
itself
a
more
distinct
channel
down
the
steeper
grade
of
the
basin
began
cutting
in
the
soft
soil
a
vertical
fall
that
from
the
foot
of
the
grade
moved
swiftly
a
mighty
cataract
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
height
and
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
moving
at
the
rate
of
from
one
to
three
miles
a
day
and
leaving
as
it
went
a
great
gorge
through
which
a
river
flowed
quietly
to
a
and
sea
the
roar
of
the
plunging
waters
the
crashing
and
booming
of
the
falling
masses
of
earth
that
were
undermined
by
the
roaring
torrent
were
heard
miles
away
acres
upon
acres
of
the
soft
fertile
land
fell
melted
and
were
swept
away
down
the
gorge
as
banks
of
snow
fall
and
melt
in
the
spring
freshets
day
and
night
night
and
day
the
immeasurable
power
of
the
river
drove
the
cataract
southward
toward
the
break
at
the
intake
through
which
by
this
time
the
entire
colorado
at
its
highest
flood
stage
was
turned
the
imminent
danger
that
threatened
the
basin
was
not
the
danger
from
the
sea
long
before
the
waters
could
fill
the
old
that
mighty
cataract
moving
ever
upstream
would
pass
the
intake
and
with
the
floor
of
the
river
lowered
thus
some
fifty
feet
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
the
water
out
for
irrigation
the
lands
reclaimed
by
the
pioneers
would
go
back
to
desert
years
before
they
would
be
buried
once
more
under
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
complete
destruction
of
all
that
the
settlers
had
gained
and
the
utter
desolation
of
the
land
was
now
a
question
of
weeks
the
company
town
of
kingston
was
directly
in
the
path
of
that
moving
niagara
while
the
company
men
were
making
a
last
desperate
effort
to
close
the
break
the
great
falls
were
eating
their
way
nearer
and
nearer
the
little
city
when
the
roar
of
the
water
and
the
crashing
and
booming
of
the
falling
banks
could
be
heard
on
the
streets
and
in
the
offices
of
the
company
the
people
left
their
homes
their
stores
and
their
shops
the
town
realizing
that
no
human
power
now
could
avert
the
disaster
heroic
efforts
were
made
to
direct
the
course
of
the
new
river
away
from
the
little
city
but
the
waters
with
savage
resistless
power
chose
their
own
way
the
pioneers
who
built
the
first
town
in
the
heart
of
the
king
basin
desert
saw
that
mighty
thundering
cataract
move
upon
the
work
of
their
hands
and
felt
the
earth
trembling
under
their
feet
as
they
watched
homes
business
blocks
the
hotel
the
opera
house
the
bank
and
finally
the
company
building
undermined
and
tumbled
crashing
into
the
deep
canyon
in
a
few
short
hours
it
was
over
the
falls
moved
on
and
where
kingston
had
once
stood
was
that
great
gorge
with
a
few
scattered
houses
only
remaining
on
each
side
that
same
day
the
last
attempt
of
the
company
men
to
close
the
break
failed
with
every
hour
the
awful
ruin
drew
nearer
the
point
which
if
reached
would
place
the
king
basin
forever
beyond
the
reclaiming
power
of
men
frantic
appeals
for
help
were
made
to
the
government
but
before
the
ponderous
machinery
of
state
with
its
intricate
and
complicated
wheels
within
wheels
could
unwind
a
sufficient
quantity
of
red
tape
the
work
of
the
pioneer
citizens
would
be
past
saving
it
was
at
this
time
that
a
telegram
from
jefferson
worth
to
the
great
man
of
the
southwestern
and
continental
brought
a
special
train
of
private
cars
into
the
basin
at
deep
well
junction
jefferson
worth
abe
lee
the
seer
and
willard
holmes
boarded
the
train
and
entered
the
car
of
the
general
manager
where
the
officials
representing
the
highest
authority
in
the
great
transcontinental
system
had
gathered
to
meet
them
in
consultation
at
republic
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
with
his
manager
and
chief
engineer
joined
them
and
the
train
moved
on
until
at
a
word
from
holmes
the
conductor
gave
the
signal
to
stop
from
the
windows
and
platform
of
the
car
the
party
could
see
the
water
extending
to
the
south
and
west
mile
after
mile
and
nearer
the
huge
plunging
cataracts
with
leaping
columns
of
spray
while
the
roar
of
the
falls
the
crashing
and
booming
of
the
caving
banks
shook
the
air
with
heavy
vibrations
and
the
earth
trembled
with
the
shock
of
the
plunging
waters
and
the
falling
masses
of
earth
just
ahead
where
kingston
had
stood
the
track
ended
on
the
bank
of
the
deep
gorge
from
here
the
party
was
driven
in
comfortable
spring
wagons
to
the
scene
of
the
company
defeat
save
for
the
camps
of
the
laborers
the
boats
implements
and
materials
of
their
warfare
and
the
debris
of
their
wrecked
structures
not
a
sign
of
their
work
remained
while
through
the
breach
widened
now
to
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
great
river
poured
its
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
second
feet
of
muddy
water
with
terrific
velocity
and
solemn
awful
power
when
the
party
had
viewed
the
situation
the
railroad
men
with
greenfield
retired
to
the
tent
of
the
company
chief
engineer
a
little
apart
from
jefferson
worth
and
his
two
companions
willard
holmes
stood
alone
on
the
brink
of
the
broken
embankment
looking
down
into
the
swirling
muddy
waters
he
knew
that
his
time
had
come
he
knew
that
at
that
moment
the
railroad
officials
were
concluding
a
deal
with
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
through
its
president
by
which
the
would
assume
control
of
the
situation
and
attempt
to
save
the
reclamation
work
his
chief
had
told
him
to
be
ready
he
was
ready
in
the
railroad
yards
at
rubio
city
and
on
every
available
for
several
miles
east
and
west
were
standing
of
ties
and
rails
in
the
yards
at
the
coast
city
were
cars
loaded
with
machinery
implements
and
supplies
in
the
yards
at
the
harbor
were
other
of
timber
and
piling
with
the
readiness
of
a
perfectly
equipped
and
organized
army
the
forces
of
the
backed
by
the
resources
of
that
powerful
system
waited
the
word
while
every
moment
the
disaster
that
threatened
the
pioneers
drew
nearer
from
the
roaring
river
at
his
feet
willard
holmes
turned
to
look
toward
the
tent
why
were
they
so
slow
then
his
face
lighted
up
and
he
took
an
eager
step
forward
as
the
private
secretary
of
the
general
manager
came
out
of
the
tent
and
hurried
toward
him
they
want
you
holmes
said
the
young
man
the
engineer
went
quickly
to
answer
the
call
when
he
entered
the
tent
every
man
in
the
party
turned
toward
the
engineer
holmes
said
his
chief
we
will
attempt
to
close
the
break
you
will
take
charge
at
once
within
an
hour
the
forces
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
already
on
the
ground
were
set
to
work
under
the
seer
preparing
the
grade
for
a
that
would
leave
the
main
line
near
the
river
fifteen
miles
north
of
the
break
and
holmes
with
abe
lee
set
out
on
horseback
for
rubio
with
the
return
of
the
general
manager
and
his
party
to
their
train
the
movement
already
planned
began
without
hurry
but
with
ready
promptness
the
orders
voiced
by
the
hundreds
of
clicking
telegraph
instruments
covering
the
district
affected
by
the
operations
were
obeyed
special
trains
carried
jefferson
worth
force
of
railroad
builders
with
teams
and
equipment
to
the
point
at
which
the
would
connect
with
the
main
line
where
under
abe
lee
they
began
pushing
the
grade
southward
to
meet
the
forces
that
under
the
seer
were
working
northward
from
the
front
throughout
the
basin
the
call
for
men
and
teams
was
issued
by
jefferson
worth
and
the
pioneers
answering
as
the
minute
men
of
old
were
hurried
to
the
scene
where
they
found
trainloads
of
equipment
waiting
ready
for
their
use
while
every
hour
brought
reinforcements
laborers
of
many
nationalities
gathered
in
the
cities
of
the
coast
by
the
agents
of
the
railroad
company
the
waiting
trains
loaded
with
ties
and
steel
began
to
move
and
the
construction
gangs
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
graders
and
when
the
last
spike
in
the
track
to
the
scene
of
the
decisive
battle
was
driven
the
with
their
sledges
stepped
aside
to
clear
the
way
for
the
panting
engines
that
drew
the
first
train
loaded
with
piling
and
timbers
for
the
trestle
hour
by
hour
now
without
pause
or
halt
the
men
under
willard
holmes
working
in
shifts
met
the
rio
colorado
in
a
fight
for
the
king
basin
lands
by
day
under
the
white
sun
by
night
in
the
light
of
locomotive
headlights
that
gleamed
strangely
over
the
dark
swirling
floods
the
trestles
were
forced
further
and
further
out
into
the
plunging
current
that
wrenched
and
twisted
and
tugged
with
terrific
strength
in
a
mad
wrestle
with
those
who
dared
attempt
to
check
its
sullen
destructive
will
while
steadily
irresistibly
the
falls
drew
nearer
and
nearer
it
was
not
alone
the
magnitude
of
the
task
directed
by
willard
holmes
that
made
the
work
heroic
it
was
that
this
seemingly
impossible
work
must
be
accomplished
against
time
in
his
fight
with
the
river
the
engineer
raced
against
a
destructive
force
which
if
it
reached
the
scene
of
the
struggle
before
the
battle
was
won
would
make
final
defeat
certain
and
place
the
colorado
so
far
as
the
king
basin
reclamation
was
concerned
beyond
control
of
men
as
the
engineer
stood
on
the
trestle
above
the
mad
whirling
currents
directing
his
men
in
their
efforts
to
drive
the
piling
in
thirty
feet
of
water
that
as
one
veteran
expressed
it
ran
like
the
mill
tails
of
hell
he
fancied
he
could
hear
above
the
roar
of
the
river
against
the
structure
the
blows
of
the
heavy
driver
the
rattle
of
cable
and
chain
and
windlass
the
grinding
and
squeaking
of
the
straining
timbers
and
the
shouts
of
the
men
the
menacing
thunder
of
that
moving
cataract
a
few
miles
away
while
he
paced
the
embankments
studying
the
set
of
the
currents
observing
the
form
and
action
of
the
eddies
or
receiving
the
hourly
reports
from
the
river
gauge
at
rubio
city
and
held
consultation
with
his
assistants
he
often
turned
his
head
involuntarily
to
look
anxiously
away
in
the
direction
of
the
racing
falls
only
when
his
exhausted
body
and
wearied
brain
refused
to
respond
longer
to
his
will
would
he
throw
himself
fully
dressed
upon
a
cot
in
his
tent
for
an
hour
sleep
his
face
grew
haggard
and
deeply
lined
with
anxious
care
his
hollow
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
burning
as
if
with
fever
his
jaws
were
set
as
if
by
sheer
power
of
his
will
he
would
beat
the
river
into
submission
and
he
barked
his
orders
shortly
in
a
hoarse
strained
voice
that
told
of
nerves
stretched
almost
to
the
breaking
point
in
critical
moments
when
it
looked
as
though
the
river
in
the
next
instant
would
reduce
their
work
to
a
hopeless
wreck
the
engineer
standing
on
the
trembling
timbers
or
clinging
to
the
swaying
itself
seemed
to
those
who
did
his
bidding
to
become
the
very
incarnation
of
human
courage
and
power
the
seer
and
abe
lee
remembering
the
man
who
had
come
out
from
the
east
to
go
with
them
on
that
preliminary
survey
wondered
at
the
transformation
then
willard
holmes
was
the
servant
of
capital
that
used
people
for
its
own
gain
he
saw
his
work
then
only
as
a
means
to
the
end
that
his
company
might
make
money
now
though
employed
still
by
a
corporation
he
was
a
master
who
used
the
power
at
his
command
in
behalf
of
the
people
he
had
come
to
look
upon
his
work
as
a
service
to
the
world
and
through
that
service
only
he
served
his
employers
it
was
as
if
in
this
man
born
of
the
best
blood
of
a
people
trained
by
the
best
of
the
cultured
east
trained
as
truly
by
his
life
and
work
in
the
desert
it
was
as
though
in
him
the
best
spirit
of
the
age
and
race
found
expression
at
last
the
trestles
were
pushed
across
the
break
the
track
was
laid
and
the
gigantic
work
of
filling
the
channel
was
begun
in
every
rock
quarry
reached
by
the
within
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
the
battle
men
were
drilling
and
blasting
and
with
steam
shovels
and
derricks
were
loading
cars
with
material
for
the
fill
at
the
word
from
willard
holmes
these
rock
trains
steamed
swiftly
to
the
front
everything
giving
them
the
right
of
way
merchants
and
manufacturers
east
and
west
cursed
the
railroad
because
their
shipments
were
delayed
passengers
held
for
hours
on
the
sidings
complained
scolded
protested
and
threatened
it
was
an
outrage
declared
the
tourists
in
their
luxurious
pullmans
that
they
should
be
forced
to
give
up
an
hour
of
their
pleasure
in
order
that
a
train
load
of
rock
might
make
better
time
but
unheeding
the
great
battleships
each
with
its
fifty
cubic
yards
of
stone
and
the
flats
and
gondolas
each
with
its
tons
of
material
thundered
away
to
the
scene
of
the
struggle
every
five
minutes
night
and
day
from
the
moment
of
the
completion
of
the
trestles
until
the
fill
was
above
the
danger
point
a
car
of
rock
was
dumped
into
the
break
so
the
task
was
accomplished
the
fight
was
won
the
rio
colorado
was
checked
in
its
work
of
destruction
and
beaten
back
into
its
old
channel
the
thousands
of
acres
of
the
king
basin
lands
that
would
have
been
forever
lost
to
the
race
through
one
corporation
were
saved
by
another
and
the
man
who
without
protest
had
built
for
his
employers
gain
the
inadequate
structures
that
endangered
the
work
of
the
pioneers
led
the
forces
that
won
the
victory
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
the
break
was
finally
closed
three
private
cars
came
in
with
the
rock
trains
the
passengers
were
the
general
manager
and
the
general
superintendent
with
their
wives
jefferson
worth
and
a
small
party
of
friends
leaving
their
cars
the
party
walked
toward
a
point
below
the
rock
embankment
where
they
could
look
down
into
the
now
empty
gorge
with
this
visible
evidence
of
the
river
power
before
them
the
visitors
exclaimed
with
wonder
when
the
superintendent
had
explained
the
magnitude
of
the
work
the
difficulties
encountered
and
how
the
task
had
been
accomplished
the
general
manager
who
here
and
there
had
added
a
word
said
after
all
friends
taking
into
consideration
money
equipment
and
everything
the
whole
question
of
a
work
like
this
or
of
any
great
enterprise
resolves
itself
into
a
question
of
men
it
up
to
the
on
the
we
have
the
system
the
machinery
without
which
this
work
could
not
have
been
done
we
have
the
capital
to
supply
material
and
labor
but
that
man
up
there
closed
the
break
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
a
figure
standing
on
the
upper
trestle
above
the
fill
outlined
against
the
sky
then
the
party
climbed
the
grade
to
the
tracks
again
and
walked
to
the
end
of
the
upper
trestle
turning
the
engineer
saw
and
came
towards
them
silently
they
stood
to
receive
him
from
boots
to
stetson
his
khaki
trousers
and
rough
shirt
were
stained
with
mud
and
grime
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
dark
hollows
his
worn
face
was
unshaven
and
his
hair
when
he
removed
his
hat
was
unkempt
he
did
not
look
like
a
hero
he
looked
more
like
some
ruffian
just
from
a
prolonged
debauch
but
the
little
party
burst
into
applause
the
engineer
smiled
as
his
chief
went
forward
from
the
group
to
grasp
him
by
the
hand
for
a
moment
they
talked
of
the
work
then
the
official
placing
his
hand
on
the
engineer
arm
said
come
holmes
we
have
some
women
here
who
want
to
meet
the
man
who
mastered
the
colorado
the
engineer
protested
he
was
not
presentable
presentable
you
the
most
presentable
man
i
know
of
this
minute
come
along
there
my
wife
making
signs
to
me
to
hurry
right
now
there
was
nothing
for
holmes
to
do
but
to
go
a
moment
later
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
rest
of
the
party
and
with

nature
and
human
nature
two
weeks
after
the
victory
of
willard
holmes
in
the
river
war
the
engineer
arrived
in
republic
on
the
evening
train
from
the
city
by
the
sea
at
the
hotel
he
was
quickly
surrounded
by
the
pioneer
citizens
who
were
eager
to
greet
him
with
expressions
of
appreciation
for
his
work
but
it
was
horace
blanton
who
did
the
talking
horace
in
his
brave
hat
his
impressively
swelling
front
of
white
vest
and
his
black
clerical
tie
was
the
personification
of
economic
financial
and
scholastic
not
to
say
ecclesiastic
dignity
his
greeting
of
the
engineer
was
majestic
but
as
a
royal
sovereign
might
welcome
the
returning
general
of
his
conquering
armies
with
sadness
at
the
thought
of
the
lives
his
victories
had
cost
the
countenance
of
horace
expressed
a
noble
grief
willard
he
said
his
voice
charged
with
emotion
i
congratulate
you
you
are
the
savior
of
this
imperial
king
basin
when
we
saw
that
greenfield
company
was
not
able
to
handle
the
awful
situation
i
told
my
friend
the
general
manager
and
our
other
officials
of
the
that
they
must
to
the
rescue
without
an
instant
delay
and
that
you
must
be
put
in
charge
of
the
work
i
knew
that
if
any
man
on
earth
could
stop
that
river
you
could
so
we
decided
to
let
you
go
ahead
you
have
justified
my
confidence
nobly
willard
you
certainly
have
i
proud
of
you
old
man
i
am
indeed
the
engineer
tried
manfully
to
appreciate
the
spirit
of
the
words
with
that
white
vest
and
black
tie
before
him
to
say
nothing
of
the
picture
hat
that
crowned
the
massive
head
it
was
impossible
for
holmes
not
to
wish
that
he
could
appreciate
horace
spirit
it
hungered
so
for
appreciation
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
blanton
said
the
engineer
but
really
i
feel
that
you
my
part
in
the
work
i
not
at
all
not
at
all
my
dear
boy
i
knew
my
man
and
i
was
not
disappointed
but
the
cost
he
shook
his
kingly
head
sorrowfully
and
heaved
a
majestic
sigh
confidentially
willard
i
estimate
that
the
financial
losses
of
greenfield
and
myself
alone
are
close
on
to
a
million
i
have
a
thing
left
wiped
me
out
clean
holmes
looked
really
sympathetic
he
knew
that
every
dollar
that
horace
blanton
ever
spent
was
a
dollar
belonging
to
someone
else
but
even
mythical
losses
of
mythical
property
when
suffered
by
horace
demanded
sympathy
the
man
in
the
white
vest
felt
them
so
keenly
and
strove
with
such
noble
courage
to
bear
them
bravely
encouraged
by
the
engineer
interest
and
the
presence
of
the
little
crowd
of
pioneers
the
speaker
continued
when
i
saw
our
beautiful
town
the
town
that
we
had
built
with
our
own
hands
falling
in
ruins
into
that
terrible
chasm
i
cried
like
a
baby
sir
even
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
filled
with
manly
tears
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
hide
then
he
lifted
his
majestic
bulk
grandly
and
looked
about
with
kingly
countenance
but
i
shall
stay
with
it
willard
i
shall
stay
and
help
these
people
to
regain
their
losses
we
desert
them
now
if
my
creditors
will
give
me
a
little
time
and
i
am
sure
they
will
not
a
man
shall
lose
a
penny
no
matter
what
it
costs
me
the
sentence
was
a
bit
ambiguous
but
it
was
a
noble
resolution
worthy
of
such
a
lofty
soul
at
this
moment
a
boy
with
the
evening
papers
approached
the
group
here
son
my
paper
called
horace
the
boy
gripped
his
wares
with
a
firm
hand
i
got
to
have
my
money
first
you
ai
done
nothin
but
promise
for
a
month
boy
give
me
my
paper
you
shall
have
your
money
he
thundered
from
the
depths
beneath
the
white
vest
the
boy
backed
away
i
dass
do
it
i
ca
live
on
hot
air
with
an
imperial
air
as
if
tremendous
stakes
hung
upon
the
trivial
incident
the
great
man
said
to
holmes
excuse
me
willard
i
must
see
about
this
and
with
a
firm
and
determined
step
he
left
the
hotel
a
hush
fell
upon
the
company
of
pioneers
not
one
of
them
but
would
have
gladly
had
he
dared
offered
the
outraged
monarch
the
price
of
a
paper
the
king
basin
settlers
were
proud
of
horace
but
that
night
horace
blanton
boarded
the
train
and
was
never
seen
in
the
king
basin
again
his
creditors
and
they
are
many
from
the
newsboy
to
the
hotel
manager
the
barber
the
laundry
agent
the
liveryman
and
are
still
giving
him
time
as
he
was
confident
that
they
would
the
pioneers
miss
him
sorely
but
they
manage
to
struggle
along
without
him
living
perhaps
in
the
hope
that
he
will
some
day
come
back
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
passing
of
horace
willard
holmes
slipped
away
from
the
group
of
men
and
approached
the
manager
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
who
was
sitting
alone
with
his
cigar
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
hello
old
man
was
burk
greeting
as
the
engineer
approached
the
thoughtful
manager
of
the
company
had
been
an
interested
observer
of
his
friend
reception
and
of
the
newspaper
incident
as
the
two
men
shook
hands
the
manager
cigar
shifted
to
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
head
tipped
toward
the
opposite
shoulder
how
much
did
horace
touch
you
for
willard
i
gave
him
my
admiration
and
sympathy
the
other
shook
his
head
wonderingly
a
special
providence
watches
over
you
my
son
after
that
nothing
could
have
saved
your
if
that
kid
had
not
been
sent
by
your
guardian
angel
to
your
rescue
when
did
you
leave
the
river
last
week
the
called
me
into
the
city
i
on
my
way
back
to
the
work
now
what
the
news
burk
grinned
the
first
train
over
the
king
basin
central
went
out
this
morning
with
a
special
party
of
distinguished
citizens
jefferson
worth
the
seer
abe
lee
and
miss
worth
the
lady
will
spend
a
week
or
two
in
the
town
of
barba
and
with
friends
in
the
south
central
district
texas
joe
and
pat
left
this
morning
in
a
rig
leading
miss
worth
saddle
horse
el
capitan
it
all
in
the
king
basin
messenger
he
handed
the
paper
to
holmes
who
mechanically
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
how
uncle
jim
he
is
at
the
office
i
think
you
know
he
is
winding
up
the
affairs
of
the
poor
old
and
i
so
i
understand
the
two
men
were
silent
for
a
moment
then
burk
said
thoughtfully
it
hard
lines
for
the
company
willard
but
the
mules
including
your
humble
servant
do
seem
to
care
much
that
one
advantage
in
being
a
mule
i
will
be
glad
to
get
back
to
civilization
and
so
will
your
uncle
jim
i
fancy
take
it
altogether
i
do
think
he
has
enjoyed
watching
the
success
of
jefferson
worth
little
experiments
as
much
as
we
have
the
same
beneficent
power
that
has
knocked
out
the
company
seems
to
have
taken
good
care
of
friend
jeff
you
are
not
going
to
stay
in
the
west
asked
the
engineer
i
go
monday
i
understand
there
is
still
a
demand
for
good
mules
back
home
the
president
of
the
wrecked
company
received
his
former
chief
engineer
warmly
and
heartily
congratulated
him
on
the
success
of
his
battle
with
the
river
i
suppose
you
know
willard
he
said
that
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
has
virtually
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
we
owe
them
a
good
half
million
for
closing
the
break
which
means
that
they
will
have
to
take
over
the
property
we
knew
when
we
went
into
the
deal
how
it
would
end
of
course
if
you
had
remained
with
the
company
the
river
never
would
have
had
a
chance
to
get
in
at
all
the
younger
man
did
not
remind
greenfield
of
the
many
times
the
company
had
been
urged
to
make
the
improvements
that
would
have
prevented
the
disaster
nor
did
he
suggest
that
he
would
have
remained
with
the
company
had
not
the
president
himself
discharged
him
your
engineer
did
all
that
any
man
could
do
after
the
break
was
made
he
said
warmly
it
was
the
equipment
and
organization
of
the
that
put
the
river
back
in
its
channel
and
no
other
power
on
earth
under
the
circumstances
could
have
done
it
in
time
to
head
off
that
the
older
man
smiled
we
all
know
who
closed
the
break
my
boy
i
suppose
you
are
planning
to
stay
with
the
railroad
they
have
offered
me
the
management
of
the
irrigation
work
here
in
the
basin
they
are
going
to
put
in
permanent
structures
and
reconstruct
the
whole
system
in
shape
and
you
accepted
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
the
older
voice
not
yet
i
asked
for
a
few
days
to
consider
james
greenfield
did
not
speak
for
several
minutes
then
he
said
hesitating
as
if
searching
for
words
do
do
it
willard
do
do
it
for
my
sake
let
go
back
home
you
know
how
i
hate
this
cursed
country
i
ought
never
to
have
gone
into
this
deal
after
what
i
had
already
suffered
in
the
west
but
it
looked
as
if
i
could
clean
up
a
good
thing
and
get
out
personally
my
money
losses
do
amount
to
anything
i
have
enough
left
for
both
of
us
and
you
know
willard
my
boy
that
it
all
yours
when
i
go
come
back
home
with
me
and
leave
this
damned
hole
we
do
fit
in
here
let
go
back
where
we
belong
i
coming
along
now
to
the
time
when
i
must
begin
to
think
of
getting
out
of
the
game
and
i
need
you
my
boy
i
need
you
willard
holmes
was
strongly
moved
by
the
appeal
of
this
man
for
whom
he
had
a
son
affection
i
wish
i
could
say
yes
uncle
jim
he
answered
i
owe
you
more
than
i
can
ever
repay
and
if
it
was
only
the
work
here
i
would
go
but
there
something
else
something
that
i
can
not
give
up
if
i
would
that
i
have
no
right
to
give
up
you
mean
that
girl
i
thought
that
was
all
settled
so
did
i
returned
the
other
grimly
when
i
talked
with
you
about
it
i
thought
there
was
no
possible
chance
for
me
and
perhaps
i
was
right
but
i
ca
let
it
go
now
without
absolute
certainty
you
do
mean
willard
that
you
are
going
to
offer
yourself
to
a
woman
whose
love
you
have
every
reason
to
think
belongs
to
another
man
the
engineer
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
when
he
spoke
there
was
in
his
voice
a
suggestion
of
that
which
marked
his
speech
in
the
days
of
the
river
fight
i
mean
this
that
no
man
on
earth
shall
take
this
woman
from
me
if
i
can
prevent
it
i
would
deserve
to
lose
her
if
i
gave
her
up
on
the
mere
guess
that
she
cared
for
another
man
i
am
going
to
know
from
her
own
words
if
there
is
still
a
chance
for
me
i
am
going
to
stay
and
fight
for
it
if
i
have
no
chance
he
dropped
into
a
chair
then
i
go
back
with
you
uncle
jim
james
greenfield
face
flushed
hotly
at
the
younger
man
words
and
then
in
the
silence
that
followed
grew
pale
and
stern
while
his
fingers
gripped
his
pencil
nervously
very
well
willard
he
said
at
last
you
are
a
man
and
your
own
master
if
your
love
for
me
can
not
influence
you
uncle
jim
the
engineer
cry
was
a
protest
and
an
appeal
but
the
other
continued
as
though
he
had
not
heard
i
can
urge
no
other
consideration
but
you
must
understand
this
i
will
never
receive
this
nameless
woman
of
unknown
parentage
as
your
wife
if
you
prefer
her
with
that
illiterate
low
cunning
trickster
whom
she
calls
father
you
need
never
expect
to
come
back
to
me
i
have
been
true
to
your
mother
in
my
care
for
you
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
give
you
the
place
in
life
that
you
are
entitled
to
fill
by
your
birth
and
family
you
have
been
my
son
in
everything
but
blood
but
by
god
sir
if
you
with
your
breeding
and
raising
if
you
can
turn
your
back
upon
the
memory
of
your
mother
and
father
and
upon
me
and
all
that
we
stand
for
if
you
can
turn
your
back
upon
us
desert
us
for
these
these
damned
cattle
you
can
herd
with
them
the
rest
of
your
life
he
was
on
his
feet
now
pacing
the
floor
angrily
the
engineer
had
also
risen
and
stood
waiting
for
this
storm
of
wrath
to
spend
itself
understand
me
the
older
man
continued
if
she
refuses
you
you
can
come
back
if
she
accepts
you
you
need
never
show
your
face
to
me
again
and
i
shall
take
good
care
that
your
friends
at
home
understand
the
reason
probably
if
you
let
these
people
know
what
the
result
will
be
if
you
are
accepted
it
will
make
a
great
difference
in
the
answer
willard
holmes
dared
not
speak
nothing
but
his
love
for
the
man
whose
devotion
to
the
engineer
mother
had
stood
the
test
of
years
enabled
the
younger
man
to
control
himself
when
he
could
speak
calmly
he
said
i
am
sorry
sir
that
you
said
that
for
you
must
see
how
you
have
made
it
impossible
for
me
now
ever
to
go
back
with
you
if
miss
worth
does
not
care
for
me
i
would
have
been
glad
to
go
home
with
you
for
next
to
her
uncle
jim
you
are
more
to
me
than
anyone
in
the
world
when
you
say
that
my
relation
to
you
shall
depend
upon
her
answer
you
make
it
impossible
for
her
answer
to
make
any
difference
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
wo
you
wo
you
reconsider
uncle
jim
wo
you
take
back
your
words
no
sir
i
have
said
exactly
what
i
mean
sir
when
the
office
door
had
closed
behind
the
engineer
james
greenfield
stood
motionless
in
the
center
of
the
room
once
he
took
a
step
toward
the
door
but
checked
himself
then
turning
slowly
wearily
he
sank
into
the
chair
before
his
desk
for
a
few
moments
he
fumbled
aimlessly
over
the
papers
and
documents
then
from
his
pocket
took
a
flat
leather
case
and
opening
it
held
in
his
hand
a
portrait
of
the
mother
as
he
looked
at
the
face
of
the
woman
who
had
never
ceased
to
hold
the
first
place
in
his
heart
his
lips
framed
words
he
could
not
speak
aloud
slowly
his
form
drooped
his
head
bowed
then
with
the
picture
held
close
he
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
among
the
business
papers
on
his
desk
chapter
xxxvi
out
of
the
hollow
of
god
hand
the
first
train
from
republic
to
barba
over
the
new
king
basin
central
arrived
in
the
town
by
the
old
dry
river
crossing
shortly
after
noon
later
in
the
day
jefferson
worth
with
his
daughter
his
superintendent
and
the
seer
went
to
the
power
plant
on
the
bank
of
dry
river
when
the
plant
was
built
it
was
placed
as
low
in
the
old
wash
as
the
depth
of
the
ancient
channel
would
permit
so
that
the
greatest
possible
fall
from
the
company
canal
above
might
be
secured
as
jefferson
worth
and
his
companions
stood
now
on
the
bank
of
the
river
they
saw
the
from
the
turbine
wheel
that
ran
the
generators
nearly
thirty
feet
above
the
bottom
of
the
channel
the
flood
that
had
cut
the
deep
canyons
through
the
heart
of
the
basin
destroying
kingston
on
its
course
had
worked
on
a
smaller
scale
in
the
old
dry
river
wash
cutting
a
narrow
gorge
nearly
fifty
feet
deep
from
its
outlet
at
the
new
sea
past
the
power
plant
at
barba
and
nearly
to
the
spillway
of
the
main
canal
standing
almost
on
the
very
spot
where
they
had
found
the
baby
girl
years
before
the
seer
asked
barbara
father
jeff
does
your
contract
with
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
call
for
a
certain
amount
of
water
or
for
water
to
develop
a
certain
amount
of
power
jefferson
worth
answered
in
his
careful
exact
voice
the
first
contract
called
for
water
to
develop
a
certain
amount
of
power
this
new
one
is
a
contract
for
three
hundred
inches
of
water
nothing
in
it
about
the
amount
of
power
but
it
gives
me
the
sole
rights
to
all
the
power
privileges
on
the
company
property
you
see
when
greenfield
tried
to
change
the
line
of
their
canal
so
as
to
cut
me
out
abe
and
i
had
begun
to
figure
that
some
day
the
water
from
the
spillway
might
cut
down
the
channel
and
give
us
a
little
more
drop
but
we
never
counted
on
this
of
course
i
simply
figured
that
i
might
just
as
well
make
the
new
contract
safe
the
seer
smiled
you
made
it
safe
all
right
jeff
do
you
know
what
this
cut
means
to
you
in
a
way
yes
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
look
at
it
it
means
said
the
seer
that
you
have
rights
here
worth
a
million
dollars
at
least
by
lowering
your
turbine
to
the
bottom
of
this
cut
you
can
with
the
same
amount
of
water
that
you
are
now
using
develop
power
enough
to
run
every
electric
light
system
and
turn
every
wheel
in
all
the
king
basin
for
years
to
come
you
mean
that
the
river
breaking
in
and
doing
this
has
made
property
worth
a
million
dollars
asked
barbara
breathlessly
the
seer
turned
toward
her
yes
barbara
the
same
force
that
destroyed
kingston
and
wrecked
the
company
has
increased
the
value
of
your
father
holding
to
fully
that
amount
a
million
is
very
conservative
the
young
woman
looked
down
into
the
gorge
at
their
feet
slowly
she
said
the
indians
must
be
right
this
must
be
indeed
la
palma
de
la
mano
de
dios
such
things
could
happen
nowhere
else
she
had
just
finished
speaking
when
the
sound
of
wheels
behind
caused
them
to
turn
toward
the
desert
and
the
old
san
felipe
trail
it
was
texas
and
pat
in
the
buckboard
with
el
capitan
leading
behind
catching
sight
of
the
group
on
the
river
bank
the
men
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
went
to
them
howdy

declared
the
irishman
looking
from
face
to
face
with
twinkling
eyes
well

who

little
kid
we
found
under
the

itsilf
that
niver
to
come
back
at
all
he
drew
the
back
of
his
huge
hairy
hand
across
his
eyes
barbara
eyes
too
were
wet
and
the
others
turned
away
their
faces
pat
words
had
recalled
so
vividly
the
scene
at
the
dry
water
hole
with
the
changes
that
the
years
had
brought
both
to
them
and
to
the
desert
it
was
texas
joe
who
broke
the
silence
worth
pat
and
i
would
like
to
see
you
some
time
this
evenin
if
you
ai
engaged
what
is
it
tex
as
he
spoke
jefferson
worth
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
old
plainsman
texas
joe
gazing
steadily
into
the
face
of
his
employer
drawled
easily
jest
a
little
matter
we
maybe
you
like
to
know
about
sir
what
time
shall
we
come
something
the
memories
of
the
place
perhaps
aroused
by
the
words
of
pat
a
moment
before
caused
jefferson
worth
to
lift
those
nervous
fingers
and
softly
caress
his
chin
i
guess
i
can
go
now
we
all
through
here
he
turned
to
the
others
i
go
on
to
the
hotel
with
tex
and
pat
and
you
folks
can
come
along
later
when
you
are
ready
he
stepped
into
the
buckboard
and
with
the
two
drove
away
at
a
livery
barn
where
they
stopped
to
leave
the
horses
texas
took
from
under
the
seat
of
the
buckboard
something
that
was
wrapped
in
a
sack
that
had
held
a
feed
of
grain
for
the
team
and
el
capitan
when
they
had
reached
the
privacy
of
worth
room
the
old
plainsman
and
the
irishman
stood
as
if
each
waited
for
the
other
to
begin
well
men
said
jefferson
worth
what
is
it
go
on
ye
owld
oysther
growled
pat
to
tex
why
the
hell
do
ye
tell
the
boss
what
we
come
to
tell
him
shpake
up
texas
joe
cleared
his
throat
and
began
formally
i
do
reckon
worth
that
has
forgot
that
outfit
we
left
in
them
sand
hills
back
yonder
on
the
old
san
felipe
trail
the
time
we
found
the
kid
at
the
words
jefferson
worth
face
became
a
gray
mask
from
behind
which
his
mind
reached
out
as
though
to
grasp
what
texas
would
say
before
the
man
put
it
into
words
well
the
single
word
came
with
the
colorless
sound
of
dull
metal
also
i
reckon
you
know
how
them
big
drifts
are
allus
on
the
move
so
that
when
they
covers
up
anything
say
an
outfit
like
that
one
it
stands
to
reason
that
some
day
they
drift
on
an
leave
it
clear
again
jefferson
worth
hands
were
gripping
the
arms
of
his
chair
his
gray
lips
could
frame
no
sound
i
allus
kind
an
eye
on
that
there
particular
ridge
continued
texas
an
so
me
and
pat
stopped
for
a
little
look
around
an
slowly
he
unwrapped
the
grain
sack
from
a
long
tin
box
an
we
found
this
he
laid
the
box
carefully
on
the
table
before
barbara
father
hit
was
with
what
was
left
of
a
bigger
wooden
box
or
trunk
which
same
had
gone
to
pieces
and
there
was
a
part
of
that
old
wagon
with
that
same
piece
of
a
you
remember
fastened
to
a
wheel
there
ai
no
sort
of
doubt
worth
that
hit
the
same
outfit
an
hits
mighty
likely
that
there
papers
in
here
that
tell
us
what
we
tried
so
hard
to
find
out
at
first
but
what
he
paused
and
looked
around
then
finished
in
a
low
tone
i
do
reckon
any
of
us
wants
to
know
now
jefferson
worth
sat
motionless
in
his
chair
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tin
box
the
heavy
voice
of
the
irishman
broke
the
quiet
av
tex
wud
a
listened
to
raison
sorr
i
the
danged
thing
into
the
river
sayin
nothin
to
nobody
fwhat
good
can
we
do
up
the
past
that
dead
an
gone
the
girl
is
as
much
yers
as
if
she
was
yer
own
flesh
an
blood
an
who
can
say
fwhat
divil

mess
may
come
out
av
this
thing
lave

alone
i
say
an
fwhat
nobody

ca
hurt
thim
was
wrong
intirely
to
bring
ut
to
ye
afther
all
ye
been
sich
a
father
to
the
little
one
lave
it
to
me
sorr
give
me
the
word
an
i
he
reached
eagerly
for
the
box
but
jefferson
worth
held
up
his
slim
nervous
hand
wait
a
moment
pat
i
i
do
think
that
would
be
right
never
before
had
these
men
seen
jefferson
worth
hesitate
the
will
of
the
man
whose
cold
decision
had
carried
him
through
so
many
critical
situations
and
upon
which
the
pioneers
had
relied
in
the
recent
time
of
peril
seemed
to
fail
him
at
last
the
spectacle
told
the
men
more
clearly
than
words
could
have
done
what
he
suffered
i
i
do
know
what
to
do
he
finished
weakly
give
me
time
let
me
think
he
bowed
his
face
in
his
hands
pat
growled
an
oath
under
his
breath
and
texas
turned
his
eyes
from
his
companions
to
the
box
and
from
the
box
back
to
his
friends
in
bewildered
uncertainty
at
last
he
said
in
his
soft
southern
drawl
worth
hit
dead
sure
that
me
an
pat
ai
helpin
you
none
in
this
i
reckon
i
was
all
wrong
to
bring
hit
to
you
at
all
but
hit
seemed
like
i
was
plumb
balled
up
an
could
rightly
say
what
was
best
there
ai
really
no
call
to
crowd
this
thing
as
i
can
see
suppose
you
takes
your
time
to
think
it
over
me
an
pat
let
you
alone
an
if
you
decides
to
fergit
all
about
hit
you
can
bet
your
last
red
we
be
damn
glad
to
help
nobody
but
us
three
will
ever
know
ai
as
if
it
was
anybody
any
harm
jefferson
worth
raised
his
head
thank
you
boys
he
said
i
have
to
figure
on
this
thing
a
little
left
alone
jefferson
worth
faced
the
temptation
of
his
life
dearer
to
this
man
than
all
the
wealth
and
power
that
he
would
realize
from
his
king
basin
work
was
the
child
who
had
come
to
him
out
of
the
desert
the
man
knew
that
it
was
the
influence
of
barbara
upon
his
life
that
had
prepared
him
for
that
night
in
the
sand
hills
and
enabled
him
rightly
to
weigh
and
measure
and
value
the
efforts
of
his
kind
that
afternoon
at
the
power
house
it
had
all
been
brought
before
him
with
startling
vividness
he
felt
that
in
all
that
he
had
accomplished
in
barbara
desert
he
had
been
led
by
the
child
who
had
come
to
him
out
of
the
hollow
of
god
hand
the
desert
had
given
her
to
him
he
had
given
himself
in
return
to
the
work
she
loved
he
could
not
think
of
his
work
apart
from
her
she
was
his
his
his
his
gray
lips
whispered
the
words
as
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
box
no
one
had
the
right
to
take
her
from
him
to
come
into
her
life
and
yet
and
yet
he
reached
out
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
box
then
turning
again
paced
the
room
suddenly
he
whirled
about
and
approached
the
table
with
cold
fury
he
seized
the
box
and
placing
it
upon
the
floor
broke
the
light
tin
fastening
with
his
again
he
paused
and
looked
dully
at
the
thing
in
his
hands
then
with
a
quick
motion
lie
threw
up
the
cover
the
box
was
filled
with
documents
and
letters
with
four
or
five
old
photographs
the
address
on
a
large
unsealed
envelope
met
his
eye
and
he
started
back
with
a
low
cry
as
though
he
had
looked
upon
some
startling
apparition
when
barbara
with
the
seer
and
abe
returned
to
the
hotel
that
evening
the
clerk
gave
her
a
note
from
her
father
who
the
note
explained
had
been
called
to
republic
on
business
of
importance
he
would
be
back
the
clerk
said
that
worth
had
left
only
a
few
minutes
before
with
the
engine
and
car
that
had
brought
them
to
barba
that
morning
chapter
xxxvii
back
to
the
old
san
felipe
trail
in
the
office
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
james
greenfield
was
aroused
by
a
knock
at
the
door
he
lifted
his
head
from
his
arms
and
looked
around
as
if
awakened
out
of
a
deep
sleep
another
knock
and
he
slipped
the
picture
he
held
in
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
called
come
in
the
door
opened
and
jefferson
worth
stepped
into
the
room
for
a
moment
the
president
of
the
wrecked
company
sat
staring
at
his
business
rival
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
his
fists
clenched
and
his
face
working
with
passion
you
ca
come
in
here
sir
get
out
he
said
with
the
voice
and
manner
he
would
have
assumed
in
speaking
to
a
trespassing
dog
jefferson
worth
stood
still
i
have
business
of
importance
with
you
greenfield
he
said
and
his
air
of
quiet
dignity
contrasted
strangely
with
the
rage
of
the
larger
man
you
can
have
no
business
with
me
of
any
sort
whatever
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
kind
this
is
my
private
office
i
tell
you
to
get
out
jefferson
worth
turned
calmly
as
though
to
obey
but
instead
of
leaving
the
room
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
then
placing
the
small
grip
he
carried
upon
the
table
he
deliberately
went
close
to
the
threatening
president
and
said
coldly
this
is
rank
nonsense
greenfield
i
leave
this
office
until
i
through
with
what
i
came
to
do
i
have
business
with
you
that
concerns
you
as
much
as
it
does
me
you
a
damned
thief
a
low
sharper
i
tell
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
now
get
out
or
i
throw
you
out
jefferson
worth
answered
in
his
exact
precise
manner
as
though
carefully
choosing
and
considering
his
words
no
you
wo
throw
me
out
you
listen
to
what
i
have
come
to
tell
you
the
rest
of
your
statement
greenfield
is
false
and
you
know
it
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
you
not
to
repeat
it
the
last
words
did
not
appear
to
be
uttered
as
a
threat
but
as
a
calm
statement
of
a
carefully
considered
fact
james
greenfield
felt
as
a
man
who
permits
himself
to
rage
against
an
immovable
obstacle
as
one
who
spends
his
strength
cursing
a
stone
wall
that
bars
his
way
or
a
rock
that
lies
in
his
path
with
an
effort
he
regained
a
measure
of
his
well
out
with
it
what
do
you
want
sit
down
said
worth
pointing
to
a
chair
mechanically
the
other
obeyed
you
have
no
reason
for
taking
this
attitude
toward
me
greenfield
began
worth
with
his
air
of
simply
stating
a
fact
at
his
words
the
wrath
of
the
other
again
mastered
him
no
reason
you
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
when
you
and
the
young
woman
that
you
call
your
daughter
have
come
between
me
and
the
boy
who
is
more
than
a
son
to
me
when
you
have
broken
our
close
relationship
of
standing
and
robbed
me
of
his
companionship
when
you
have
wrecked
and
ruined
all
my
plans
for
his
future
when
you
have
defeated
the
object
of
my
life
no
reason
but
what
can
you
understand
of
us
you
a
nobody
sir
without
a
place
or
a
name
in
the
world
a
common
ignorant
sharper
with
no
family
but
a
nameless
daughter
of
unknown
parentage
whom
you
found
on
the
desert
how
can
you
understand
what
willard
holmes
is
to
me
i
figured
that
you
would
feel
this
way
about
it
came
the
colorless
words
that
what
i
came
here
for
to
fix
it
up
the
angry
amazement
of
greenfield
at
what
he
considered
the
presumption
could
find
no
expression
worth
continued
i
know
a
great
deal
more
about
you
and
your
folks
than
you
think
when
i
saw
that
my
he
hesitated
over
the
word
then
spoke
it
plainly
my
daughter
was
becoming
interested
in
willard
holmes
i
took
some
pains
to
look
up
his
history
in
doing
that
i
naturally
found
out
a
good
deal
about
you
later
i
learned
a
good
deal
more
it
is
immaterial
to
me
what
you
know
muttered
the
other
in
a
tone
of
deep
disgust
what
do
you
want
worth
spoke
with
quiet
dignity
i
want
you
to
understand
first
greenfield
that
my
girl
is
just
as
much
to
me
as
young
holmes
is
to
you
you
are
right
i
am
a
nobody
ignorant
and
all
that
but
you
must
not
think
greenfield
that
because
you
belong
in
new
york
and
i
belong
in
the
west
that
this
thing
is
harder
for
you
than
it
is
for
me
you
are
not
going
to
lose
your
boy
but
i
for
the
first
time
he
hesitated
and
his
voice
expressed
emotion
i
am
going
to
lose
my
girl
the
pathos
of
this
lonely
man
words
touched
even
greenfield
his
manner
was
more
gentle
as
he
said
gruffly
it
a
bad
business
worth
a
damned
bad
business
for
both
of
us
i
wish
i
had
never
heard
of
this
country
you
feel
different
about
that
anyway
i
figure
that
this
country
and
this
work
will
be
here
long
after
you
and
i
are
gone
and
so
will
these
young
people
again
he
hesitated
and
his
slim
fingers
caressed
his
chin
then
from
behind
that
gray
mask
he
asked
how
much
do
you
know
about
our
finding
barbara
in
the
desert
i
know
the
story
in
a
general
way
that
all
it
does
not
interest
me
let
me
tell
you
the
facts
in
his
brief
colorless
sentences
jefferson
worth
related
the
incidents
of
that
trip
across
the
desert
and
as
he
did
so
greenfield
began
to
realize
that
some
powerful
motive
had
brought
this
man
to
him
and
was
forcing
him
to
relate
his
story
with
such
exact
care
for
the
details
and
you
never
found
the
slightest
clue
even
to
the
child
name
he
asked
when
worth
had
finished
jefferson
worth
hesitated
then
greenfield
you
had
a
younger
brother
who
came
west
the
man
gazed
at
the
speaker
in
amazement
as
he
answered
mechanically
yes
he
died
out
here
somewhere
in
california
i
believe
i
was
never
able
to
learn
the
details
he
was
an
adventurous
lad
and
a
good
deal
of
a
rover
but
why
how
as
the
full
import
of
the
question
dawned
upon
him
greenfield
started
from
his
seat
my
god
man
you
do
mean
you
can
not
mean
that
it
was
my
brother
will
who
was
lost
in
that
sandstorm
on
the
desert
that
the
woman
you
found
by
the
water
hole
was
his
wife
gertrude
and
that
that
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
will
wrote
me
that
there
was
a
child
that
she
had
gertrude
hair
and
eyes
i
had
never
seen
her
he
turned
fiercely
upon
his
companion
and
you
have
kept
this
from
me
all
these
years
you
have
kept
my
only
child
from
me
by
god
sir
i
but
perhaps
this
is
all
one
of
your
damnable
tricks
what
proof
have
you
that
this
is
so
and
if
it
is
why
have
you
kept
it
a
secret
jefferson
worth
opened
his
satchel
and
laid
the
tin
box
on
the
desk
before
the
president
of
the
king
basin
land
and
irrigation
company
this
box
was
found
this
afternoon
by
texas
joe
and
pat
who
brought
it
to
me
i
opened
it
it
is
all
here
when
greenfield
had
examined
the
contents
of
the
box
letters
some
of
them
written
by
himself
to
his
brother
papers
relating
to
william
greenfield
business
affairs
and
property
and
photographs
of
the
little
family
and
of
the
two
brothers
and
their
parents
he
looked
up
to
see
jefferson
worth
sitting
motionless
his
form
relaxed
his
head
dropped
forward
illustration
without
a
word
for
no
word
was
needed
their
hands
met
in
a
firm
grip
suddenly
the
words
of
the
man
who
had
been
a
father
to
his
child
came
back
to
greenfield
my
girl
is
just
as
much
to
me
as
young
holmes
is
to
you
you
are
not
going
to
lose
your
boy
but
i
am
going
to
lose
my
girl
in
a
flash
the
financier
saw
it
all
saw
how
jefferson
worth
loved
barbara
as
his
own
child
as
greenfield
cared
for
willard
holmes
saw
how
worth
might
have
destroyed
the
papers
so
strangely
brought
to
light
and
kept
the
secret
saw
and
realized
a
little
what
strength
of
character
it
had
taken
to
overcome
the
temptation
and
felt
what
the
man
was
suffering
as
greenfield
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
jefferson
worth
slowly
lifted
his
head
slowly
he
rose
to
his
feet
in
silence
the
two
men
faced
each
other
without
a
word
for
no
word
was
hands
met
in
a
firm
grip
after
a
little
while
greenfield
asked
eagerly
where
is
she
now
worth
where
is
the
girl
does
she
know
i
must
see
her
at
once
come
and
willard
i
wonder
if
he
is
still
in
town
come
we
must
go
to
them
but
jefferson
worth
answered
i
been
figuring
on
that
greenfield
you
had
better
let
me
tell
barbara
myself
and
if
i
was
you
after
what
you
have
probably
said
to
holmes
on
this
subject
i
would
be
in
a
hurry
to
tell
him
for
the
sake
of
their
future
better
let
barbara
handle
that
matter
herself
you
can
easily
figure
it
out
that
it
will
be
best
for
them
that
way
chapter
xxxviii
the
heritage
of
barbara
worth
barbara
walking
quickly
left
the
little
village
and
crossing
dry
river
on
the
bridge
that
now
spanned
the
deep
gorge
where
the
old
san
felipe
trail
once
led
down
into
the
ancient
wash
climbed
the
slight
grade
to
the
grave
that
was
marked
by
the
simple
headstone
with
its
one
word
mother
that
morning
jefferson
worth
had
told
her
of
the
tin
box
found
by
texas
joe
and
pat
with
reverent
care
she
had
read
the
papers
and
letters
and
had
looked
long
at
the
portraits
of
her
parents
and
people
she
could
not
at
first
realize
that
the
desert
had
at
last
given
up
the
secret
that
she
had
so
longed
to
know
it
was
not
real
to
her
the
revelation
was
so
sudden
so
startling
she
could
not
think
of
herself
save
as
the
daughter
of
jefferson
worth
whom
she
loved
as
a
father
as
soon
as
the
noon
day
meal
was
over
she
had
left
her
room
in
the
hotel
and
once
out
of
doors
her
steps
had
instinctively
turned
toward
her
mother
grave
beside
the
old
trail
standing
before
the
headstone
she
looked
at
the
one
word
mother
she
said
softly
mother
then
still
in
a
whisper
she
repeated
the
unfamiliar
names
gertrude
greenfield
william
greenfield
my
mother
my
father
i
am
barbara
greenfield
barbara
greenfield
seating
herself
on
the
ground
beside
the
grave
she
looked
about
at
the
sand
hills
in
the
distance
at
the
dry
river
gorge
and
the
power
plant
at
the
canals
shining
like
silver
bands
among
the
green
fields
of
the
ranchers
to
the
southeast
and
at
the
little
town
an
hour
passed
then
another
and
another
across
the
river
she
saw
pablo
riding
out
of
the
town
and
away
along
the
road
that
follows
the
canal
then
from
the
power
house
came
abe
lee
with
the
seer
she
watched
them
as
they
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
old
channel
once
she
thought
she
would
call
to
them
but
hesitated
if
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
came
up
the
hill
they
would
be
sure
to
see
her
so
she
waited
keeping
still
they
passed
the
bridge
and
continued
on
down
the
bank
of
the
stream
barbara
knew
instinctively
that
they
were
talking
of
her
and
the
secret
that
the
desert
had
at
last
revealed
for
she
had
asked
her
father
to
tell
them
she
thought
of
her
father
who
had
gone
to
republic
he
would
return
that
evening
and
greenfield
her
uncle
would
be
with
him
her
uncle
how
strange
then
barbara
saw
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
horseman
riding
from
the
south
toward
the
town
she
could
not
mistake
the
figure
that
while
fully
at
home
in
the
saddle
still
lacked
the
indescribable
easy
looseness
and
swinging
grace
of
the
western
rider
it
was
willard
holmes
and
the
young
woman
heart
told
her
why
the
engineer
had
come
since
that
meeting
at
the
river
in
the
hour
of
his
victory
she
had
known
that
he
would
come
and
she
had
known
what
her
answer
would
be
he
had
evidently
ridden
from
the
river
from
his
work
did
he
know
no
she
decided
he
could
not
know
yet
then
the
quick
thought
came
he
not
know
until
she
herself
should
tell
him
quickly
the
young
woman
walked
down
the
hill
across
the
bridge
toward
the
town
willard
holmes
arrived
at
the
hotel
and
learning
that
miss
worth
was
out
carried
a
chair
to
the
arcade
on
the
street
to
await
her
return
he
had
not
waited
long
when
a
voice
at
his
shoulder
said
with
mock
formality
i
believe
this
is
willard
holmes
the
engineer
sprang
to
his
feet
miss
worth
they
told
me
that
you
were
out
i
was
sitting
here
waiting
for
you
i
was
out
when
you
arrived
she
confessed
but
i
saw
you
coming
and
hurried
back
pronto
i
knew
you
had
just
left
the
river
you
see
and
of
course
she
added
as
though
that
explained
her
eagerness
to
see
him
i
wanted
to
hear
the
latest
news
from
the
work
there
is
no
news
he
answered
as
though
dismissing
the
matter
finally
and
may
i
ask
what
brings
you
to
barba
he
looked
at
her
steadily
you
brought
me
to
barba
i
yes
you
i
stopped
in
republic
on
my
way
back
from
the
city
the
evening
of
the
day
you
left
i
was
forced
to
go
on
to
the
river
but
took
the
first
opportunity
to
ride
out
here
for
i
understood
you
expected
to
be
in
barba
several
days
surely
you
know
why
i
have
come
the
work
i
stayed
in
the
basin
to
do
is
finished
i
have
another
offer
from
the
which
if
i
accept
will
keep
me
here
for
several
years
i
have
come
to
you
with
it
as
i
came
with
the
other
what
shall
i
do
please
do
pretend
that
you
do
understand
me
the
direct
forcefulness
of
the
man
almost
made
barbara
forget
the
little
plan
she
had
arranged
on
her
way
to
the
hotel
to
meet
him
i
wo
pretend
holmes
she
answered
seriously
but
will
you
go
with
me
for
a
little
ride
into
the
desert
her
words
recalled
to
his
mind
instantly
their
first
meeting
in
rubio
city
but
holmes
was
not
astonished
now
the
invitation
coming
from
barbara
under
the
circumstances
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
the
young
woman
went
to
her
room
to
make
ready
while
the
engineer
brought
the
horses
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
were
following
the
old
san
felipe
trail
toward
the
sand
hills
very
few
words
passed
between
them
until
they
reached
the
great
drift
that
had
held
so
long
its
secret
leaving
the
horses
at
request
they
climbed
the
steep
sides
of
the
great
sand
mound
from
the
top
they
could
see
on
every
hand
the
many
miles
of
the
king
basin
country
from
lone
mountain
at
the
end
of
the
delta
dam
to
the
sentinels
of
san
antonio
pass
and
from
the
sky
line
of
the
mesa
and
the
low
hills
on
the
east
to
no
man
mountains
and
the
bold
wall
of
the
coast
range
that
shuts
out
the
beautiful
country
on
the
west
the
soft
veils
and
scarfs
of
the
desert
with
the
gold
of
the
sand
hills
the
purple
of
the
mountains
the
gray
and
green
of
the
desert
vegetation
with
the
ragged
patches
of
dun
plain
were
all
there
still
as
when
willard
holmes
had
first
looked
upon
it
for
the
work
of
reclamation
was
still
far
from
finished
but
there
was
more
in
barbara
desert
now
than
pictures
woven
magically
in
the
air
there
were
beautiful
scenes
of
farms
with
houses
and
barns
and
fences
and
stacks
with
cattle
and
horses
in
the
pastures
and
fields
of
growing
grain
the
dark
green
of
alfalfa
with
threads
and
lines
and
spots
of
water
that
under
the
flood
of
white
light
from
the
wide
sky
shone
in
the
distance
like
gleaming
silver
barbara
and
the
engineer
could
even
distinguish
the
little
towns
of
republic
and
frontera
with
barba
nearby
and
even
as
they
looked
they
marked
the
tall
column
of
smoke
from
a
locomotive
on
the
moving
toward
the
crossing
of
the
old
san
felipe
trail
and
on
the
basin
central
another
coming
toward
the
town
on
dry
river
where
once
beside
a
dry
water
hole
a
woman
lay
dead
with
an
empty
canteen
by
her
side
willard
holmes
drew
a
long
breath
you
like
my
desert
asked
the
young
woman
softly
coming
closer
to
his
side
so
close
that
he
felt
her
presence
as
clearly
as
he
felt
the
presence
of
the
spirit
that
lives
in
the
desert
itself
like
it
he
repeated
turning
toward
her
it
is
my
desert
now
mine
as
well
as
yours
oh
barbara
barbara
i
have
learned
the
language
of
your
land
must
i
leave
it
now
wo
you
tell
me
to
stay
he
held
out
his
hands
to
her
but
she
drew
back
a
little
from
his
eagerness
wait
i
must
know
something
first
before
i
can
answer
he
looked
at
her
questioningly
what
must
you
know
barbara
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
what
happened
here
in
these
very
sand
hills
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
the
daughter
of
jefferson
worth
yes
he
answered
gravely
i
know
that
worth
is
not
your
own
father
but
i
did
not
know
that
this
was
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
and
you
understand
that
i
am
nameless
that
no
one
knows
my
parentage
that
there
may
even
be
mexican
or
indian
blood
in
my
veins
you
understand
you
realize
all
that
he
started
toward
her
almost
roughly
yes
i
understand
all
that
but
i
care
only
that
you
are
barbara
i
know
only
that
i
want
you
you
barbara
but
your
family
greenfield
your
friends
back
home
think
what
it
means
to
them
can
you
barbara
he
cried
stop
why
are
you
saying
these
things
listen
to
me
do
you
that
i
love
you
do
you
know
that
nothing
else
matters
your
desert
has
taught
me
many
things
dear
but
nothing
so
great
as
this
that
i
want
you
and
that
nothing
else
matters
i
want
you
for
my
wife
but
you
said
once
that
you
would
never
persisted
the
young
woman
what
has
changed
you
said
that
i
would
never
marry
you
i
said
that
that
can
not
be
barbara
you
are
mistaken
she
shook
her
head
that
is
what
you
said
i
heard
you
myself
you
told
greenfield
at
my
house
that
morning
he
came
to
see
you
when
you
were
hurt
i
i
the
door
into
the
dining
room
was
open
and
i
heard
the
light
of
quick
understanding
broke
over
the
engineer
face
and
you
heard
what
uncle
jim
said
to
me
but
barbara
did
you
hear
the
reason
i
gave
him
for
saying
that
i
would
not
marry
you
i
i
could
hear
anything
after
that
she
said
simply
at
her
confession
the
man
strong
face
shone
with
triumph
listen
dear
i
told
uncle
jim
i
would
never
marry
you
because
you
loved
someone
else
and
that
there
was
no
chance
for
me
barbara
brown
eyes
opened
wide
you
thought
that
yes
i
thought
you
loved
abe
lee
why
why
i
love
abe
the
man
laughed
of
course
you
do
but
i
thought
you
loved
him
as
i
wanted
you
to
love
me
do
you
understand
the
exclamation
was
a
confession
an
explanation
and
an
expression
of
complete
understanding
but
that
she
added
as
she
went
to
him
that
not
and
then
but
barbara
words
rightly
understood
mark
the
end
of
my
story
rarely
is
it
given
in
the
story
of
life
to
those
who
work
greatly
or
love
greatly
to
gather
the
fruit
of
their
toil
or
passion
but
it
is
given
those
others
perhaps
those
for
whom
it
could
not
be
to
know
a
happiness
greater
it
may
be
than
the
joy
of
possession
the
end
