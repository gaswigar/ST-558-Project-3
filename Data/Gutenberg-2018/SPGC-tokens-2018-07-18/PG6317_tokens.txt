if
it
may
be
said
that
nova

are
not

in
the

sense
of
the
word
on
both
sides
my
family
were
sailors
and
if
any
slocum
should
be
found
not
seafaring
he
will
show
at
least
an
inclination
to
whittle
models
of
boats
and
contemplate
voyages
my
father
was
the
sort
of
man
who
if
wrecked
on
a
desolate
island
would
find
his
way
home
if
he
had
a
and
could
find
a
tree
he
was
a
good
judge
of
a
boat
but
the
old
clay
farm
which
some
calamity
made
his
was
an
anchor
to
him
he
was
not
afraid
of
a
capful
of
wind
and
he
never
took
a
back
seat
at
a
or
a
good
revival
as
for
myself
the
wonderful
sea
charmed
me
from
the
first
at
the
age
of
eight
i
had
already
been
afloat
along
with
other
boys
on
the
bay
with
chances
greatly
in
favor
of
being
drowned
when
a
lad
i
filled
the
important
post
of
cook
on
a
but
i
was
not
long
in
the
galley
for
the
crew
mutinied
at
the
appearance
of
my
first
duff
and
chucked
me
out
before
i
had
a
chance
to
shine
as
a
culinary
artist
the
next
step
toward
the
goal
of
happiness
found
me
before
the
mast
in
a
ship
bound
on
a
foreign
voyage
thus
i
came
over
the
bows
and
not
in
through
the
cabin
windows
to
the
command
of
a
ship
my
best
command
was
that
of
the
magnificent
ship
of
which
i
was
i
had
a
right
to
be
proud
of
her
for
at
that
time
in
the
eighties
she
was
the
finest
american
afloat
afterward
i
owned
and
sailed
the
a
little
bark
which
of
all
man
handiwork
seemed
to
me
the
nearest
to
perfection
of
beauty
and
which
in
speed
when
the
wind
blew
asked
no
favors
of
steamers
i
had
been
nearly
twenty
years
a
shipmaster
when
i
quit
her
deck
on
the
coast
of
brazil
where
she
was
wrecked
my
home
voyage
to
new
york
with
my
family
was
made
in
the
canoe
without
accident
illustration

by
taber
the
captain
joshua
slocum
bound
for
liverpool
my
voyages
were
all
foreign
i
sailed
as
freighter
and
trader
principally
to
china
australia
and
japan
and
among
the
spice
islands
mine
was
not
the
sort
of
life
to
make
one
long
to
coil
up
one
ropes
on
land
the
customs
and
ways
of
which
i
had
finally
almost
forgotten
and
so
when
times
for
freighters
got
bad
as
at
last
they
did
and
i
tried
to
quit
the
sea
what
was
there
for
an
old
sailor
to
do
i
was
born
in
the
breezes
and
i
had
studied
the
sea
as
perhaps
few
men
have
studied
it
neglecting
all
else
next
in
attractiveness
after
seafaring
came
i
longed
to
be
master
in
both
professions
and
in
a
small
way
in
time
i
accomplished
my
desire
from
the
decks
of
stout
ships
in
the
worst
gales
i
had
made
calculations
as
to
the
size
and
sort
of
ship
safest
for
all
weather
and
all
seas
thus
the
voyage
which
i
am
now
to
narrate
was
a
natural
outcome
not
only
of
my
love
of
adventure
but
of
my
lifelong
experience
one
midwinter
day
of
in
boston
where
i
had
been
cast
up
from
old
ocean
so
to
speak
a
year
or
two
before
i
was
cogitating
whether
i
should
apply
for
a
command
and
again
eat
my
bread
and
butter
on
the
sea
or
go
to
work
at
the
shipyard
when
i
met
an
old
acquaintance
a
who
said
come
to
fairhaven
and
i
give
you
a
ship
but
he
added
she
wants
some
repairs
the
captain
terms
when
fully
explained
were
more
than
satisfactory
to
me
they
included
all
the
assistance
i
would
require
to
fit
the
craft
for
sea
i
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
for
i
had
already
found
that
i
could
not
obtain
work
in
the
shipyard
without
first
paying
fifty
dollars
to
a
society
and
as
for
a
ship
to
command
there
were
not
enough
ships
to
go
round
nearly
all
our
tall
vessels
had
been
cut
down
for
and
were
being
ignominiously
towed
by
the
nose
from
port
to
port
while
many
worthy
captains
addressed
themselves
to
snug
harbor
the
next
day
i
landed
at
fairhaven
opposite
new
bedford
and
found
that
my
friend
had
something
of
a
joke
on
me
for
seven
years
the
joke
had
been
on
him
the
ship
proved
to
be
a
very
antiquated
sloop
called
the
which
the
neighbors
declared
had
been
built
in
the
year
she
was
affectionately
propped
up
in
a
field
some
distance
from
salt
water
and
was
covered
with
canvas
the
people
of
fairhaven
i
hardly
need
say
are
thrifty
and
observant
for
seven
years
they
had
asked
i
wonder
what
captain
eben
pierce
is
going
to
do
with
the
old
the
day
i
appeared
there
was
a
buzz
at
the
gossip
exchange
at
last
some
one
had
come
and
was
actually
at
work
on
the
old
breaking
her
up
i
no
going
to
rebuild
her
great
was
the
amazement
will
it
pay
was
the
question
which
for
a
year
or
more
i
answered
by
declaring
that
i
would
make
it
pay
my
ax
felled
a
stout
near
by
for
a
keel
and
farmer
howard
for
a
small
sum
of
money
hauled
in
this
and
enough
timbers
for
the
frame
of
the
new
vessel
i
rigged
a
and
a
pot
for
a
boiler
the
timbers
for
ribs
being
straight
saplings
were
dressed
and
steamed
till
supple
and
then
bent
over
a
log
where
they
were
secured
till
set
something
tangible
appeared
every
day
to
show
for
my
labor
and
the
neighbors
made
the
work
sociable
it
was
a
great
day
in
the
shipyard
when
her
new
stem
was
set
up
and
fastened
to
the
new
keel
came
from
far
to
survey
it
with
one
voice
they
pronounced
it
a
and
in
their
opinion
fit
to
smash
ice
the
oldest
captain
shook
my
hand
warmly
when
the
were
put
in
declaring
that
he
could
see
no
reason
why
the
should
not
cut
in
yet
off
the
coast
of
greenland
the
was
from
the
butt
of
the
smartest
kind
of
a
pasture
oak
it
afterward
split
a
coral
patch
in
two
at
the
keeling
islands
and
did
not
receive
a
blemish
better
timber
for
a
ship
than
pasture
white
oak
never
grew
the
as
well
as
all
the
ribs
were
of
this
wood
and
were
steamed
and
bent
into
shape
as
required
it
was
hard
upon
march
when
i
began
work
in
earnest
the
weather
was
cold
still
there
were
plenty
of
inspectors
to
back
me
with
advice
when
a
hove
in
sight
i
just
rested
on
my
adz
awhile
and
gammed
with
him
new
bedford
the
home
of
is
connected
with
fairhaven
by
a
bridge
and
the
walking
is
good
they
never
worked
along
up
to
the
shipyard
too
often
for
me
it
was
the
charming
tales
about
arctic
whaling
that
inspired
me
to
put
a
double
set
of
in
the
that
she
might
shunt
ice
the
seasons
came
quickly
while
i
worked
hardly
were
the
ribs
of
the
sloop
up
before
were
in
bloom
then
the
daisies
and
the
cherries
came
soon
after
close
by
the
place
where
the
old
had
now
dissolved
rested
the
ashes
of
john
cook
a
revered
pilgrim
father
so
the
new
rose
from
hallowed
ground
from
the
deck
of
the
new
craft
i
could
put
out
my
hand
and
pick
cherries
that
grew
over
the
little
grave
the
planks
for
the
new
vessel
which
i
soon
came
to
put
on
were
of
georgia
pine
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
the
operation
of
putting
them
on
was
tedious
but
when
on
the
calking
was
easy
the
outward
edges
stood
slightly
open
to
receive
the
calking
but
the
inner
edges
were
so
close
that
i
could
not
see
daylight
between
them
all
the
butts
were
fastened
by
through
bolts
with
tightening
them
to
the
timbers
so
that
there
would
be
no
complaint
from
them
many
bolts
with
were
used
in
other
parts
of
the
construction
in
all
about
a
thousand
it
was
my
purpose
to
make
my
vessel
stout
and
strong
illustration
of
the
now
it
is
a
law
in
lloyd
that
the
repaired
all
out
of
the
old
until
she
is
entirely
new
is
still
the
the
changed
her
being
so
gradually
that
it
was
hard
to
say
at
what
point
the
old
died
or
the
new
took
birth
and
it
was
no
matter
the
bulwarks
i
built
up
of
stanchions
fourteen
inches
high
and
covered
with
white
pine
these
stanchions
mortised
through
a
i
calked
with
thin
cedar
wedges
they
have
remained
perfectly
tight
ever
since
the
deck
i
made
of
by
white
pine
spiked
to
beams
six
by
six
inches
of
yellow
or
georgia
pine
placed
three
feet
apart
the
were
one
over
the
aperture
of
the
main
hatch
six
feet
by
six
for
a
and
a
trunk
farther
aft
about
ten
feet
by
twelve
for
a
cabin
both
of
these
rose
about
three
feet
above
the
deck
and
were
sunk
sufficiently
into
the
hold
to
afford
in
the
spaces
along
the
sides
of
the
cabin
under
the
deck
i
arranged
a
berth
to
sleep
in
and
shelves
for
small
storage
not
forgetting
a
place
for
the
in
the
midship
hold
that
is
the
space
between
cabin
and
galley
under
the
deck
was
room
for
provision
of
water
salt
beef
ample
for
many
months
the
hull
of
my
vessel
being
now
put
together
as
strongly
as
wood
and
iron
could
make
her
and
the
various
rooms
partitioned
off
i
set
about
calking
ship
grave
fears
were
entertained
by
some
that
at
this
point
i
should
fail
i
myself
gave
some
thought
to
the
advisability
of
a
professional
calker
the
very
first
blow
i
struck
on
the
cotton
with
the
which
i
thought
was
right
many
others
thought
wrong
it
crawl
cried
a
man
from
marion
passing
with
a
basket
of
clams
on
his
back
it
crawl
cried
another
from
west
island
when
he
saw
me
driving
cotton
into
the
seams
bruno
simply
wagged
his
tail
even
ben
j
a
noted
authority
on
whose
mind
however
was
said
to
totter
asked
rather
confidently
if
i
did
not
think
it
would
crawl
how
fast
will
it
crawl
cried
my
old
captain
friend
who
had
been
towed
by
many
a
lively
tell
us
how
fast
cried
he
that
we
may
get
into
port
in
time
illustration
crawl
however
i
drove
a
thread
of
oakum
on
top
of
the
cotton
as
from
the
first
i
had
intended
to
do
and
bruno
again
wagged
his
tail
the
cotton
never
crawled
when
the
calking
was
finished
two
coats
of
copper
paint
were
slapped
on
the
bottom
two
of
white
lead
on
the
topsides
and
bulwarks
the
rudder
was
then
shipped
and
painted
and
on
the
following
day
the
was
launched
as
she
rode
at
her
ancient
anchor
she
sat
on
the
water
like
a
swan
the
dimensions
were
when
finished
feet
nine
inches
long
over
all
fourteen
feet
two
inches
wide
and
four
feet
two
inches
deep
in
the
hold
her
tonnage
being
nine
tons
net
and
twelve
and
hundredths
tons
gross
then
the
mast
a
smart
new
hampshire
spruce
was
fitted
and
likewise
all
the
small
appurtenances
necessary
for
a
short
cruise
sails
were
bent
and
away
she
flew
with
my
friend
captain
pierce
and
me
across
buzzard
bay
on
a
all
right
the
only
thing
that
now
worried
my
friends
along
the
beach
was
will
she
pay
the
cost
of
my
new
vessel
was
for
materials
and
thirteen
months
of
my
own
labor
i
was
several
months
more
than
that
at
fairhaven
for
i
got
work
now
and
then
on
an
occasional
fitting
farther
down
the
harbor
and
that
kept
me
the
overtime
chapter
ii
failure
as
a
fisherman
a
voyage
around
the
world
projected
from
boston
to
gloucester
fitting
out
for
the
ocean
voyage
half
of
a
dory
for
a
ship
boat
the
run
from
gloucester
to
nova
scotia
a
shaking
up
in
home
waters
among
old
friends
i
spent
a
season
in
my
new
craft
fishing
on
the
coast
only
to
find
that
i
had
not
the
cunning
properly
to
bait
a
hook
but
at
last
the
time
arrived
to
weigh
anchor
and
get
to
sea
in
earnest
i
had
resolved
on
a
voyage
around
the
world
and
as
the
wind
on
the
morning
of
april
was
fair
at
noon
i
weighed
anchor
set
sail
and
filled
away
from
boston
where
the
had
been
moored
snugly
all
winter
the
whistles
were
blowing
just
as
the
sloop
shot
ahead
under
full
sail
a
short
board
was
made
up
the
harbor
on
the
port
tack
then
coming
about
she
stood
seaward
with
her
boom
well
off
to
port
and
swung
past
the
ferries
with
lively
heels
a
photographer
on
the
outer
pier
at
east
boston
got
a
picture
of
her
as
she
swept
by
her
flag
at
the
peak
throwing
its
folds
clear
a
thrilling
pulse
beat
high
in
me
my
step
was
light
on
deck
in
the
crisp
air
i
felt
that
there
could
be
no
turning
back
and
that
i
was
engaging
in
an
adventure
the
meaning
of
which
i
thoroughly
understood
i
had
taken
little
advice
from
any
one
for
i
had
a
right
to
my
own
opinions
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
sea
that
the
best
of
sailors
might
do
worse
than
even
i
alone
was
borne
in
upon
me
not
a
league
from
boston
docks
where
a
great
steamship
fully
manned
officered
and
piloted
lay
stranded
and
broken
this
was
the
she
was
broken
completely
in
two
over
a
ledge
so
in
the
first
hour
of
my
lone
voyage
i
had
proof
that
the
could
at
least
do
better
than
this
steamship
for
i
was
already
farther
on
my
voyage
than
she
take
warning
and
have
a
care
i
uttered
aloud
to
my
bark
passing
fairylike
silently
down
the
bay
the
wind
freshened
and
the
rounded
deer
island
light
at
the
rate
of
seven
knots
passing
it
she
squared
away
direct
for
gloucester
to
procure
there
some
fishermen
stores
waves
dancing
joyously
across
massachusetts
bay
met
her
coming
out
of
the
harbor
to
dash
them
into
myriads
of
sparkling
gems
that
hung
about
her
at
every
surge
the
day
was
perfect
the
sunlight
clear
and
strong
every
particle
of
water
thrown
into
the
air
became
a
gem
and
the
bounding
ahead
snatched
necklace
after
necklace
from
the
sea
and
as
often
threw
them
away
we
have
all
seen
miniature
rainbows
about
a
ship
prow
but
the
flung
out
a
bow
of
her
own
that
day
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
her
good
angel
had
embarked
on
the
voyage
i
so
read
it
in
the
sea
bold
nahant
was
soon
abeam
then
marblehead
was
put
astern
other
vessels
were
outward
bound
but
none
of
them
passed
the
flying
along
on
her
course
i
heard
the
clanking
of
the
dismal
bell
on
norman
woe
as
we
went
by
and
the
reef
where
the
schooner
struck
i
passed
close
aboard
the
bones
of
a
wreck
tossed
up
lay
bleaching
on
the
shore
abreast
the
wind
still
freshening
i
settled
the
throat
of
the
mainsail
to
ease
the
sloop
helm
for
i
could
hardly
hold
her
before
it
with
the
whole
mainsail
set
a
schooner
ahead
of
me
lowered
all
sail
and
ran
into
port
under
bare
poles
the
wind
being
fair
as
the
brushed
by
the
stranger
i
saw
that
some
of
his
sails
were
gone
and
much
broken
canvas
hung
in
his
rigging
from
the
effects
of
a
squall
i
made
for
the
cove
a
lovely
branch
of
gloucester
fine
harbor
again
to
look
the
over
and
again
to
weigh
the
voyage
and
my
feelings
and
all
that
the
bay
was
as
my
little
vessel
tore
in
smothered
in
foam
it
was
my
first
experience
of
coming
into
port
alone
with
a
craft
of
any
size
and
in
among
shipping
old
fishermen
ran
down
to
the
wharf
for
which
the
was
heading
apparently
intent
upon
braining
herself
there
i
hardly
know
how
a
calamity
was
averted
but
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
almost
i
let
go
the
wheel
stepped
quickly
forward
and
downed
the
jib
the
sloop
naturally
rounded
in
the
wind
and
just
ranging
ahead
laid
her
cheek
against
a
at
the
windward
corner
of
the
wharf
so
quietly
after
all
that
she
would
not
have
broken
an
egg
very
leisurely
i
passed
a
rope
around
the
post
and
she
was
moored
then
a
cheer
went
up
from
the
little
crowd
on
the
wharf
you
could
done
it
better
cried
an
old
skipper
if
you
weighed
a
ton
now
my
weight
was
rather
less
than
the
fifteenth
part
of
a
ton
but
i
said
nothing
only
putting
on
a
look
of
careless
indifference
to
say
for
me
oh
that
nothing
for
some
of
the
ablest
sailors
in
the
world
were
looking
at
me
and
my
wish
was
not
to
appear
green
for
i
had
a
mind
to
stay
in
gloucester
several
days
had
i
uttered
a
word
it
surely
would
have
betrayed
me
for
i
was
still
quite
nervous
and
short
of
breath
i
remained
in
gloucester
about
two
weeks
fitting
out
with
the
various
articles
for
the
voyage
most
readily
obtained
there
the
owners
of
the
wharf
where
i
lay
and
of
many
put
on
board
dry
cod
galore
also
a
barrel
of
oil
to
calm
the
waves
they
were
old
skippers
themselves
and
took
a
great
interest
in
the
voyage
they
also
made
the
a
present
of
a
fisherman
own
lantern
which
i
found
would
throw
a
light
a
great
distance
round
indeed
a
ship
that
would
run
another
down
having
such
a
good
light
aboard
would
be
capable
of
running
into
a
a
gaff
a
pugh
and
a
all
of
which
an
old
fisherman
declared
i
could
not
sail
without
were
also
put
aboard
then
top
from
across
the
cove
came
a
case
of
copper
paint
a
famous
antifouling
article
which
stood
me
in
good
stead
long
after
i
slapped
two
coats
of
this
paint
on
the
bottom
of
the
while
she
lay
a
tide
or
so
on
the
hard
beach
for
a
boat
to
take
along
i
made
shift
to
cut
a
castaway
dory
in
two
athwartships
boarding
up
the
end
where
it
was
cut
this
i
could
hoist
in
and
out
by
the
nose
easily
enough
by
hooking
the
into
a
strop
fitted
for
the
purpose
a
whole
dory
would
be
heavy
and
awkward
to
handle
alone
manifestly
there
was
not
room
on
deck
for
more
than
the
half
of
a
boat
which
after
all
was
better
than
no
boat
at
all
and
was
large
enough
for
one
man
i
perceived
moreover
that
the
newly
arranged
craft
would
answer
for
a
when
placed
athwartships
and
also
for
a
indeed
for
the
former
office
my
razeed
dory
gained
such
a
reputation
on
the
voyage
that
my
washerwoman
at
samoa
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
she
could
see
with
one
eye
that
it
was
a
new
invention
which
beat
any
yankee
notion
ever
brought
by
missionaries
to
the
islands
and
she
had
to
have
it
the
want
of
a
chronometer
for
the
voyage
was
all
that
now
worried
me
in
our
newfangled
notions
of
navigation
it
is
supposed
that
a
mariner
can
not
find
his
way
without
one
and
i
had
myself
drifted
into
this
way
of
thinking
my
old
chronometer
a
good
one
had
been
long
in
disuse
it
would
cost
fifteen
dollars
to
clean
and
rate
it
fifteen
dollars
for
sufficient
reasons
i
left
that
timepiece
at
home
where
the
dutchman
left
his
anchor
i
had
the
great
lantern
and
a
lady
in
boston
sent
me
the
price
of
a
large
cabin
lamp
which
lighted
the
cabin
at
night
and
by
some
small
contriving
served
for
a
stove
through
the
day
being
thus
refitted
i
was
once
more
ready
for
sea
and
on
may
again
made
sail
with
little
room
in
which
to
turn
the
in
gathering
headway
scratched
the
paint
off
an
old
craft
in
the
fairway
being
puttied
and
painted
for
a
summer
voyage
pay
for
that
growled
the
painters
i
will
said
i
with
the
echoed
the
captain
of
the
close
by
which
was
his
way
of
saying
that
i
was
off
there
was
nothing
to
pay
for
above
five
cents
worth
of
paint
maybe
but
such
a
din
was
raised
between
the
old
hooker
and
the
which
now
took
up
my
case
that
the
first
cause
of
it
was
forgotten
altogether
anyhow
no
bill
was
sent
after
me
the
weather
was
mild
on
the
day
of
my
departure
from
gloucester
on
the
point
ahead
as
the
stood
out
of
the
cove
was
a
lively
picture
for
the
front
of
a
tall
factory
was
a
flutter
of
handkerchiefs
and
caps
pretty
faces
peered
out
of
the
windows
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
building
all
smiling
some
hailed
me
to
know
where
away
and
why
alone
why
when
i
made
as
if
to
stand
in
a
hundred
pairs
of
arms
reached
out
and
said
come
but
the
shore
was
dangerous
the
sloop
worked
out
of
the
bay
against
a
light
southwest
wind
and
about
noon
squared
away
off
eastern
point
receiving
at
the
same
time
a
hearty
salute
the
last
of
many
kindnesses
to
her
at
gloucester
the
wind
freshened
off
the
point
and
skipping
along
smoothly
the
was
soon
off
thatcher
island
lights
thence
shaping
her
course
east
by
compass
to
go
north
of
cashes
ledge
and
the
amen
rocks
i
sat
and
considered
the
matter
all
over
again
and
asked
myself
once
more
whether
it
were
best
to
sail
beyond
the
ledge
and
rocks
at
all
i
had
only
said
that
i
would
sail
round
the
world
in
the
dangers
of
the
sea
excepted
but
i
must
have
said
it
very
much
in
earnest
the
with
myself
seemed
to
bind
me
and
so
i
sailed
on
toward
night
i
hauled
the
sloop
to
the
wind
and
baiting
a
hook
sounded
for
in
thirty
fathoms
of
water
on
the
edge
of
cashes
ledge
with
fair
success
i
hauled
till
dark
landing
on
deck
three
cod
and
two
haddocks
one
hake
and
best
of
all
a
small
halibut
all
plump
and
spry
this
i
thought
would
be
the
place
to
take
in
a
good
stock
of
provisions
above
what
i
already
had
so
i
put
out
a
that
would
hold
her
head
to
windward
the
current
being
southwest
against
the
wind
i
felt
quite
sure
i
would
find
the
still
on
the
bank
or
near
it
in
the
morning
then
stradding
the
cable
and
putting
my
great
lantern
in
the
rigging
i
lay
down
for
the
first
time
at
sea
alone
not
to
sleep
but
to
doze
and
to
dream
i
had
read
somewhere
of
a
hooking
her
anchor
into
a
whale
and
being
towed
a
long
way
and
at
great
speed
this
was
exactly
what
happened
to
the
in
my
dream
i
could
not
shake
it
off
entirely
when
i
awoke
and
found
that
it
was
the
wind
blowing
and
the
heavy
sea
now
running
that
had
disturbed
my
short
rest
a
scud
was
flying
across
the
moon
a
storm
was
brewing
indeed
it
was
already
stormy
i
reefed
the
sails
then
hauled
in
my
and
setting
what
canvas
the
sloop
could
carry
headed
her
away
for
monhegan
light
which
she
made
before
daylight
on
the
morning
of
the
the
wind
being
free
i
ran
on
into
round
pond
harbor
which
is
a
little
port
east
from
pemaquid
here
i
rested
a
day
while
the
wind
rattled
among
the
on
shore
but
the
following
day
was
fine
enough
and
i
put
to
sea
first
writing
up
my
log
from
cape
ann
not
omitting
a
full
account
of
my
adventure
with
the
whale

nor
no

the
heading
east
stretched
along
the
coast
among
many
islands
and
over
a
tranquil
sea
at
evening
of
this
day
may
she
came
up
with
a
considerable
island
which
i
shall
always
think
of
as
the
island
of
frogs
for
the
was
charmed
by
a
million
voices
from
the
island
of
frogs
we
made
for
the
island
of
birds
called
gannet
island
and
sometimes
gannet
rock
whereon
is
a
bright
intermittent
light
which
flashed
fitfully
across
the
deck
as
she
coasted
along
under
its
light
and
shade
thence
shaping
a
course
for
briar
island
i
came
among
vessels
the
following
afternoon
on
the
western
and
after
speaking
a
fisherman
at
anchor
who
gave
me
a
wrong
course
the
sailed
directly
over
the
southwest
ledge
through
the
worst
in
the
bay
of
fundy
and
got
into
westport
harbor
in
nova
scotia
where
i
had
spent
eight
years
of
my
life
as
a
lad
the
fisherman
may
have
said
the
course
i
was
steering
when
i
hailed
him
but
i
thought
he
said
and
i
accordingly
changed
it
to
that
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
answer
me
at
all
he
improved
the
occasion
of
his
own
curiosity
to
know
where
i
was
from
and
if
i
was
alone
and
if
i
did
have
no
dorg
nor
no
cat
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
my
life
at
sea
that
i
had
heard
a
hail
for
information
answered
by
a
question
i
think
the
chap
belonged
to
the
foreign
islands
there
was
one
thing
i
was
sure
of
and
that
was
that
he
did
not
belong
to
briar
island
because
he
dodged
a
sea
that
slopped
over
the
rail
and
stopping
to
brush
the
water
from
his
face
lost
a
fine
cod
which
he
was
about
to
ship
my
islander
would
not
have
done
that
it
is
known
that
a
briar
islander
fish
or
no
fish
on
his
hook
never
flinches
from
a
sea
he
just
tends
to
his
lines
and
hauls
or
saws
nay
have
i
not
seen
my
old
friend
deacon
d
a
good
man
of
the
island
while
listening
to
a
sermon
in
the
little
church
on
the
hill
reach
out
his
hand
over
the
door
of
his
pew
and
jig
imaginary
squid
in
the
aisle
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
young
people
who
did
not
realize
that
to
catch
good
fish
one
must
have
good
bait

thing
most
on

dream
i
was
delighted
to
reach
westport
any
port
at
all
would
have
been
delightful
after
the
terrible
thrashing
i
got
in
the
fierce
rip
and
to
find
myself
among
old
schoolmates
now
was
charming
it
was
the
of
the
month
and
is
my
lucky
number

fact
registered
long
before
nansen
sailed
in

of
the
north

thirteen
perhaps
he
had
heard
of
my
success

taking
a
most
extraordinary
ship
successfully
to
brazil
with
that
number
of
crew
the
very
stones
on
briar

i
was
glad
to
see
again
and
i
knew
them
all
the
little
shop
round
the
corner
which
for
years
i
had
not
seen
was
the
same
except
that
it
looked
a
deal
smaller
it
wore
the
same
shingles
i
was
sure
of
it
for
did
not
i
know
the
roof
where
we
boys
night
after
night
hunted
for
the
skin
of
a
black
cat
to
be
taken
on
a
dark
night
to
make
a
plaster
for
a
poor
lame
man

the

lived
there

boys
were

his
day
he
was
fond
of
the
gun
he
always
carried
his
powder
loose
in
the
tail
pocket
of
his
coat
he
usually
had
in
his
mouth
a
short
dudeen

in
an
evil
moment
he
put

found
that

i
sailed

into

following
day
on

fog

i
spent
some
days
pleasantly

took
in
some
butter
for
the
voyage
also
a
barrel
of
potatoes
filled
six
barrels
of
water
and
stowed
all
under
deck
at
yarmouth
too
i
got
my
famous
tin
clock
the
only
timepiece
i
carried
on
the
whole
voyage
the
price
of
it
was
a
dollar
and
a

did

watched

sink

sambro
the

of
them
all
was

was

may
also

the

till
this

had
held
off
now
lowered
over
the
sea
like
a
pall
i
was
in
a
world
of
fog
shut
off
from
the
universe
i
did
not
see
any
more
of
the
light
by
the
lead
which
i
cast
often
i
found
that
a
little
after
midnight
i
was
passing
the
east
point
of
the
island
and
should
soon
be
clear
of
dangers
of
land

was
holding
free

it
was
from

point

evening
sir
on
the
evening
of
july
the
after
having
steered
all
day
over
a
lumpy
sea
took
it
into
her
head
to
go
without
the
aid
i
had
been
steering
southeast
by
south
but
the
wind
hauling
forward
a
bit
she
dropped
into
a
smooth
lane
heading
southeast
and
making
about
eight
knots
her
very
best
work
i
crowded
on
sail
to
cross
the
track
of
the
liners
without
loss
of
time
and
to
reach
as
soon
as
possible
the
friendly
gulf
stream
the
fog
lifting
before
night
i
was
afforded
a
look
at
the
sun
just
as
it
was
touching
the
sea
i
watched
it
go
down
and
out
of
sight
then
i
turned
my
face
eastward
and
there
apparently
at
the
very
end
of
the
bowsprit
was
the
smiling
full
moon
rising
out
of
the
sea
neptune
himself
coming
over
the
bows
could
not
have
startled
me
more
good
evening
sir
i
cried
i
glad
to
see
you
many
a
long
talk
since
then
i
have
had
with
the
man
in
the
moon
he
had
my
confidence
on
the
voyage
about
midnight
the
fog
shut
down
again
denser
than
ever
before
one
could
almost
stand
on
it
it
continued
so
for
a
number
of
days
the
wind
increasing
to
a
gale
the
waves
rose
high
but
i
had
a
good
ship
still
in
the
dismal
fog
i
felt
myself
drifting
into
loneliness
an
insect
on
a
straw
in
the
midst
of
the
elements
i
lashed
the
helm
and
my
vessel
held
her
course
and
while
she
sailed
i
slept
during
these
days
a
feeling
of
awe
crept
over
me
my
memory
worked
with
startling
power
the
ominous
the
insignificant
the
great
the
small
the
wonderful
the
commonplace
all
appeared
before
my
mental
vision
in
magical
succession
pages
of
my
history
were
recalled
which
had
been
so
long
forgotten
that
they
seemed
to
belong
to
a
previous
existence
i
heard
all
the
voices
of
the
past
laughing
crying
telling
what
i
had
heard
them
tell
in
many
corners
of
the
earth
the
loneliness
of
my
state
wore
off
when
the
gale
was
high
and
i
found
much
work
to
do
when
fine
weather
returned
then
came
the
sense
of
solitude
which
i
could
not
shake
off
i
used
my
voice
often
at
first
giving
some
order
about
the
affairs
of
a
ship
for
i
had
been
told
that
from
disuse
i
should
lose
my
speech
at
the
meridian
altitude
of
the
sun
i
called
aloud
eight
bells
after
the
custom
on
a
ship
at
sea
again
from
my
cabin
i
cried
to
an
imaginary
man
at
the
helm
how
does
she
head
there
and
again
is
she
on
her
course
but
getting
no
reply
i
was
reminded
the
more
palpably
of
my
condition
my
voice
sounded
hollow
on
the
empty
air
and
i
dropped
the
practice
however
it
was
not
long
before
the
thought
came
to
me
that
when
i
was
a
lad
i
used
to
sing
why
not
try
that
now
where
it
would
disturb
no
one
my
musical
talent
had
never
bred
envy
in
others
but
out
on
the
atlantic
to
realize
what
it
meant
you
should
have
heard
me
sing
you
should
have
seen
the
porpoises
leap
when
i
pitched
my
voice
for
the
waves
and
the
sea
and
all
that
was
in
it
old
turtles
with
large
eyes
poked
their
heads
up
out
of
the
sea
as
i
sang
johnny
boker
and
we
pay
darby
doyl
for
his
boots
and
the
like
but
the
porpoises
were
on
the
whole
vastly
more
appreciative
than
the
turtles
they
jumped
a
deal
higher
one
day
when
i
was
humming
a
favorite
chant
i
think
it
was
babylon
a
porpoise
jumped
higher
than
the
bowsprit
had
the
been
going
a
little
faster
she
would
have
scooped

so
small
a

must
be
considered

it
was
the
greatest
run
the
ever
made
before
or
since
in
so
few
days
on
the
evening
of
july
in
better
humor
than
ever
before
all
hands
cried

ho
the
sail
was
a
barkantine
three
points
on
the
weather
bow
hull
down
then
came
the
night
my
ship
was
sailing
along
now
without
attention
to
the
helm
the
wind
was
south
she
was
heading
east
her
sails
were
trimmed
like
the
sails
of
the
nautilus
they
drew
steadily
all
night
i
went
frequently
on
deck
but
found
all
well
a
merry
breeze
kept
on
from
the
south
early
in
the
morning
of
the
the
was
close
aboard
the
stranger
which
proved
to
be
of
vigo
days
from
philadelphia
bound
for
vigo
a
lookout
from
his
masthead
had
spied
the
the
evening
before
the
captain
when
i
came
near
enough
threw
a
line
to
me
and
sent
a
bottle
of
wine
across
slung
by
the
neck
and
very
good
wine
it
was
he
also
sent
his
card
which
bore
the
name
of

i
think
he
was
a
good
man
as
spaniards
go
but
when
i
asked
him
to
report
me
all
well
the
passing
him
in
a
lively
manner
he
hauled
his
shoulders
much
above
his
head
and
when
his
mate
who
knew
of
my
expedition
told
him
that
i
was
alone
he
crossed
himself
and
made
for
his
cabin
i
did
not
see
him
again
by
sundown
he
was
as
far
astern
as
he
had
been
ahead
the
evening
before
illustration
he
also
sent
his
card
there
was
now
less
and
less
monotony
on
july
the
wind
was
northwest
and
clear
the
sea
smooth
and
a
large
bark
hull
down
came
in
sight
on
the
lee
bow
and
at
i
spoke
the
stranger
she
was
the
bark
of
glasgow
from
peru
for
queenstown
for
orders
her
old
captain
was
bearish
but
i
met
a
bear
once
in
alaska
that
looked
pleasanter
at
least
the
bear
seemed
pleased
to
meet
me
but
this
grizzly
old
man
well
i
suppose
my
hail
disturbed
his
siesta
and
my
little
sloop
passing
his
great
ship
had
somewhat
the
effect
on
him
that
a
red
rag
has
upon
a
bull
i
had
the
advantage
over
heavy
ships
by
long
odds
in
the
light
winds
of
this
and
the
two
previous
days
the
wind
was
light
his
ship
was
heavy
and
foul
making
poor
headway
while
the
with
a
great
mainsail
bellying
even
to
light
winds
was
just
skipping
along
as
nimbly
as
one
could
wish
how
long
has
it
been
calm
about
here
roared
the
captain
of
the
as
i
came
within
hail
of
him
dunno
i
shouted
back
as
loud
as
i
could
bawl
i
have
been
here
long
at
this
the
mate
on
the
forecastle
wore
a
broad
grin
i
left
cape
sable
fourteen
days
ago
i
added
i
was
now
well
across
toward
the
azores
mate
he
roared
to
his
chief
officer
mate
come
here
and
listen
to
the
yankee
yarn
haul
down
the
flag
mate
haul
down
the
flag
in
the
best
of
humor
after
all
the
surrendered
to
the
illustration
chart
of
the
course
around
the
world
april
to
july
the
acute
pain
of
solitude
experienced
at
first
never
returned
i
had
penetrated
a
mystery
and
by
the
way
i
had
sailed
through
a
fog
i
had
met
neptune
in
his
wrath
but
he
found
that
i
had
not
treated
him
with
contempt
and
so
he
suffered
me
to
go
on
and
explore
in
the
log
for
july
there
is
this
entry
fine
weather
wind
porpoises
gamboling
all
about
the
passed
at
long
degrees
it
lacks
now
three
minutes
of
the
shouted
the
captain
as
he
gave
me
the
longitude
and
the
time
i
admired
the
businesslike
air
of
the
but
i
have
the
feeling
still
that
the
captain
was
just
a
little
too
precise
in
his
reckoning
that
may
be
all
well
enough
however
where
there
is
plenty
of
but
i
believe
was
the
cause
of
the
disaster
to
the
liner
and
many
more
like
her
the
captain
knew
too
well
where
he
was
there
were
no
porpoises
at
all
skipping
along
with
the
porpoises
always
prefer
the
captain
was
a
young
man
i
observed
and
had
before
him
i
hope
a
good
record
land
ho
on
the
morning
of
july
a
mystic
dome
like
a
mountain
of
silver
stood
alone
in
the
sea
ahead
although
the
land
was
completely
hidden
by
the
white
glistening
haze
that
shone
in
the
sun
like
polished
silver
i
felt
quite
sure
that
it
was
flores
island
at
four
it
was
abeam
the
haze
in
the
meantime
had
disappeared
flores
is
one
hundred
and
miles
from
fayal
and
although
it
is
a
high
island
it
remained
many
years
undiscovered
after
the
principal
group
of
the
islands
had
been
colonized
early
on
the
morning
of
july
i
saw
pico
looming
above
the
clouds
on
the
starboard
bow
lower
lands
burst
forth
as
the
sun
burned
away
the
morning
fog
and
island
after
island
came
into
view
as
i
approached
nearer
cultivated
fields
appeared
and
oh
how
green
the
corn
only
those
who
have
seen
the
azores
from
the
deck
of
a
vessel
realize
the
beauty
of
the
picture
illustration
the
island
of
pico
at
i
cast
anchor
at
fayal
exactly
eighteen
days
from
cape
sable
the
american
consul
in
a
smart
boat
came
alongside
before
the
reached
the
breakwater
and
a
young
naval
officer
who
feared
for
the
safety
of
my
vessel
boarded
and
offered
his
services
as
pilot
the
youngster
i
have
no
good
reason
to
doubt
could
have
handled
a
but
the
was
too
small
for
the
amount
of
uniform
he
wore
however
after
fouling
all
the
craft
in
port
and
sinking
a
lighter
she
was
moored
without
much
damage
to
herself
this
wonderful
pilot
expected
a
gratification
i
understood
but
whether
for
the
reason
that
his
government
and
not
i
would
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
raising
the
lighter
or
because
he
did
not
sink
the
i
could
never
make
out
but
i
forgive
him
it
was
the
season
for
fruit
when
i
arrived
at
the
azores
and
there
was
soon
more
of
all
kinds
of
it
put
on
board
than
i
knew
what
to
do
with
islanders
are
always
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
and
i
met
none
anywhere
kinder
than
the
good
hearts
of
this
place
the
people
of
the
azores
are
not
a
very
rich
community
the
burden
of
taxes
is
heavy
with
scant
privileges
in
return
the
air
they
breathe
being
about
the
only
thing
that
is
not
taxed
the
does
not
even
allow
them
a
port
of
entry
for
a
foreign
mail
service
a
packet
passing
never
so
close
with
mails
for
horta
must
deliver
them
first
in
lisbon
ostensibly
to
be
fumigated
but
really
for
the
tariff
from
the
packet
my
own
letters
posted
at
horta
reached
the
united
states
six
days
behind
my
letter
from
gibraltar
mailed
thirteen
days
later
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
horta
was
the
feast
of
a
great
saint
boats
loaded
with
people
came
from
other
islands
to
celebrate
at
horta
the
capital
or
jerusalem
of
the
azores
the
deck
of
the
was
crowded
from
morning
till
night
with
men
women
and
children
on
the
day
after
the
feast
a
native
harnessed
a
team
and
drove
me
a
day
over
the
beautiful
roads
all
about
fayal
because
said
he
in
broken
english
when
i
was
in
america
and
could
speak
a
word
of
english
i
found
it
hard
till
i
met
some
one
who
seemed
to
have
time
to
listen
to
my
story
and
i
promised
my
good
saint
then
that
if
ever
a
stranger
came
to
my
country
i
would
try
to
make
him
happy
unfortunately
this
gentleman
brought
along
an
interpreter
that
i
might
learn
more
of
the
country
the
fellow
was
nearly
the
death
of
me
talking
of
ships
and
voyages
and
of
the
boats
he
had
steered
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
wished
to
hear
he
had
sailed
out
of
new
bedford
so
he
said
for
that
joe
wing
they
call
my
friend
and
host
found
hardly
a
chance
to
edge
in
a
word
before
we
parted
my
host
dined
me
with
a
cheer
that
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
a
prince
but
he
was
quite
alone
in
his
house
my
wife
and
children
all
rest
there
said
he
pointing
to
the
churchyard
across
the
way
i
moved
to
this
house
from
far
off
he
added
to
be
near
the
spot
where
i
pray
every
morning
i
remained
four
days
at
fayal
and
that
was
two
days
more
than
i
had
intended
to
stay
it
was
the
kindness
of
the
islanders
and
their
touching
simplicity
which
detained
me
a
damsel
as
innocent
as
an
angel
came
alongside
one
day
and
said
she
would
embark
on
the
if
i
would
land
her
at
lisbon
she
could
cook
she
thought
but
her
forte
was
dressing
her
brother
antonio
who
served
as
interpreter
hinted
that
anyhow
he
would
like
to
make
the
trip
antonio
heart
went
out
to
one
john
wilson
and
he
was
ready
to
sail
for
america
by
way
of
the
two
capes
to
meet
his
friend
do
you
know
john
wilson
of
boston
he
cried
i
knew
a
john
wilson
i
said
but
not
of
boston
he
had
one
daughter
and
one
son
said
antonio
by
way
of
identifying
his
friend
if
this
reaches
the
right
john
wilson
i
am
told
to
say
that
antonio
of
pico
remembers
him
illustration

of
the
atlantic
voyages
from
boston
to

thence
to
the

iv
squally
weather
in
the
azores
high
living
delirious
from
cheese
and
plums
the
pilot
of
the
at
gibraltar
compliments
exchanged
with
the
british
navy
a
picnic
on
the
morocco
shore
i
set
sail
from
horta
early
on
july
the
southwest
wind
at
the
time
was
light
but
squalls
came
up
with
the
sun
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
get
reefs
in
my
sails
before
i
had
gone
a
mile
i
had
hardly
set
the
mainsail
when
a
squall
of
wind
down
the
mountains
struck
the
sloop
with
such
violence
that
i
thought
her
mast
would
go
however
a
quick
helm
brought
her
to
the
wind
as
it
was
one
of
the
weather
lanyards
was
carried
away
and
the
other
was
stranded
my
tin
basin
caught
up
by
the
wind
went
flying
across
a
french
to
leeward
it
was
more
or
less
squally
all
day
sailing
along
under
high
land
but
rounding
close
under
a
bluff
i
found
an
opportunity
to
mend
the
lanyards
broken
in
the
squall
no
sooner
had
i
lowered
my
sails
when
a
boat
shot
out
from
some
gully
in
the
rocks
with
a
customs
officer
on
board
who
thought
he
had
come
upon
a
smuggler
i
had
some
difficulty
in
making
him
comprehend
the
true
case
however
one
of
his
crew
a
sailorly
chap
who
understood
how
matters
were
while
we
palavered
jumped
on
board
and
rove
off
the
new
lanyards
i
had
already
prepared
and
with
a
friendly
hand
helped
me
set
up
the
rigging
this
incident
gave
the
turn
in
my
favor
my
story
was
then
clear
to
all
i
have
found
this
the
way
of
the
world
let
one
be
without
a
friend
and
see
what
will
happen
passing
the
island
of
pico
after
the
rigging
was
mended
the
stretched
across
to
leeward
of
the
island
of
michael
which
she
was
up
with
early
on
the
morning
of
july
the
wind
blowing
hard
later
in
the
day
she
passed
the
prince
of
monaco
fine
bound
to
fayal
where
on
a
previous
voyage
the
prince
had
slipped
his
cables
to
escape
a
reception
which
the
padres
of
the
island
wished
to
give
him
why
he
so
dreaded
the
ovation
i
could
not
make
out
at
horta
they
did
not
know
since
reaching
the
islands
i
had
lived
most
luxuriously
on
fresh
bread
butter
vegetables
and
fruits
of
all
kinds
plums
seemed
the
most
plentiful
on
the
and
these
i
ate
without
stint
i
had
also
a
pico
white
cheese
that
general
manning
the
american
had
given
me
which
i
supposed
was
to
be
eaten
and
of
this
i
partook
with
the
plums
alas
by
i
was
doubled
up
with
cramps
the
wind
which
was
already
a
smart
breeze
was
increasing
somewhat
with
a
heavy
sky
to
the
reefs
had
been
turned
out
and
i
must
turn
them
in
again
somehow
between
cramps
i
got
the
mainsail
down
hauled
out
the
earings
as
best
i
could
and
tied
away
point
by
point
in
the
double
reef
there
being
i
should
in
strict
prudence
have
made
all
snug
and
gone
down
at
once
to
my
cabin
i
am
a
careful
man
at
sea
but
this
night
in
the
coming
storm
i
swayed
up
my
sails
which
reefed
though
they
were
were
still
too
much
in
such
heavy
weather
and
i
saw
to
it
that
the
sheets
were
securely
belayed
in
a
word
i
should
have
laid
to
but
did
not
i
gave
her
the
mainsail
and
whole
jib
instead
and
set
her
on
her
course
then
i
went
below
and
threw
myself
upon
the
cabin
floor
in
great
pain
how
long
i
lay
there
i
could
not
tell
for
i
became
delirious
when
i
came
to
as
i
thought
from
my
swoon
i
realized
that
the
sloop
was
plunging
into
a
heavy
sea
and
looking
out
of
the
companionway
to
my
amazement
i
saw
a
tall
man
at
the
helm
his
rigid
hand
grasping
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
held
them
as
in
a
vise
one
may
imagine
my
astonishment
his
rig
was
that
of
a
foreign
sailor
and
the
large
red
cap
he
wore
was
cockbilled
over
his
left
ear
and
all
was
set
off
with
shaggy
black
whiskers
he
would
have
been
taken
for
a
pirate
in
any
part
of
the
world
while
i
gazed
upon
his
threatening
aspect
i
forgot
the
storm
and
wondered
if
he
had
come
to
cut
my
throat
this
he
seemed
to
divine
senor
said
he
doffing
his
cap
i
have
come
to
do
you
no
harm
and
a
smile
the
faintest
in
the
world
but
still
a
smile
played
on
his
face
which
seemed
not
unkind
when
he
spoke
i
have
come
to
do
you
no
harm
i
have
sailed
free
he
said
but
was
never
worse
than
a
i
am
one
of
columbus
crew
he
continued
i
am
the
pilot
of
the
pinta
come
to
aid
you
lie
quiet
senor
captain
he
added
and
i
will
guide
your
ship
you
have
a
but
you
will
be
all
right
tomorrow
i
thought
what
a
very
devil
he
was
to
carry
sail
again
as
if
he
read
my
mind
he
exclaimed
yonder
is
the
ahead
we
must
overtake
her
give
her
sail
give
her
sail
vale
muy
vale
biting
off
a
large
quid
of
black
twist
he
said
you
did
wrong
captain
to
mix
cheese
with
plums
white
cheese
is
never
safe
unless
you
know
whence
it
comes
it
may
have
been
from
de
and
becoming
capricious
illustration
the
apparition
at
the
wheel
avast
there
i
cried
i
have
no
mind
for
moralizing
i
made
shift
to
spread
a
mattress
and
lie
on
that
instead
of
the
hard
floor
my
eyes
all
the
while
fastened
on
my
strange
guest
who
remarking
again
that
i
would
have
only
pains
and
calentura
chuckled
as
he
chanted
a
wild
song
high
are
the
waves
fierce
gleaming
high
is
the
tempest
roar
high
the
screaming
high
the
azore
i
suppose
i
was
now
on
the
mend
for
i
was
peevish
and
complained
i
detest
your
jingle
your
azore
should
be
at
roost
and
would
have
been
were
it
a
respectable
bird
i
begged
he
would
tie
a
on
the
rest
of
the
song
if
there
was
any
more
of
it
i
was
still
in
agony
great
seas
were
boarding
the
but
in
my
fevered
brain
i
thought
they
were
boats
falling
on
deck
that
careless
draymen
were
throwing
from
wagons
on
the
pier
to
which
i
imagined
the
was
now
moored
and
without
fenders
to
breast
her
off
you
smash
your
boats
i
called
out
again
and
again
as
the
seas
crashed
on
the
cabin
over
my
head
you
smash
your
boats
but
you
ca
hurt
the
she
is
strong
i
cried
i
found
when
my
pains
and
calentura
had
gone
that
the
deck
now
as
white
as
a
shark
tooth
from
seas
washing
over
it
had
been
swept
of
everything
movable
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
now
at
broad
day
that
the
was
still
heading
as
i
had
left
her
and
was
going
like
a
racehorse
columbus
himself
could
not
have
held
her
more
exactly
on
her
course
the
sloop
had
made
ninety
miles
in
the
night
through
a
rough
sea
i
felt
grateful
to
the
old
pilot
but
i
marveled
some
that
he
had
not
taken
in
the
jib
the
gale
was
moderating
and
by
noon
the
sun
was
shining
a
meridian
altitude
and
the
distance
on
the
patent
log
which
i
always
kept
towing
told
me
that
she
had
made
a
true
course
throughout
the
hours
i
was
getting
much
better
now
but
was
very
weak
and
did
not
turn
out
reefs
that
day
or
the
night
following
although
the
wind
fell
light
but
i
just
put
my
wet
clothes
out
in
the
sun
when
it
was
shining
and
lying
down
there
myself
fell
asleep
then
who
should
visit
me
again
but
my
old
friend
of
the
night
before
this
time
of
course
in
a
dream
you
did
well
last
night
to
take
my
advice
said
he
and
if
you
would
i
should
like
to
be
with
you
often
on
the
voyage
for
the
love
of
adventure
alone
finishing
what
he
had
to
say
he
again
doffed
his
cap
and
disappeared
as
mysteriously
as
he
came
returning
i
suppose
to
the
phantom
i
awoke
much
refreshed
and
with
the
feeling
that
i
had
been
in
the
presence
of
a
friend
and
a
seaman
of
vast
experience
i
gathered
up
my
clothes
which
by
this
time
were
dry
then
by
inspiration
i
threw
overboard
all
the
plums
in
the
vessel
july
was
exceptionally
fine
the
wind
from
the
northwest
was
light
and
the
air
balmy
i
overhauled
my
wardrobe
and
bent
on
a
white
shirt
against
nearing
some
with
genteel
folk
on
board
i
also
did
some
washing
to
get
the
salt
out
of
my
clothes
after
it
all
i
was
hungry
so
i
made
a
fire
and
very
cautiously
stewed
a
dish
of
pears
and
set
them
carefully
aside
till
i
had
made
a
pot
of
delicious
coffee
for
both
of
which
i
could
afford
sugar
and
cream
but
the
crowning
dish
of
all
was
a
and
there
was
enough
of
it
for
two
i
was
in
good
health
again
and
my
appetite
was
simply
ravenous
while
i
was
dining
i
had
a
large
onion
over
the
double
lamp
stewing
for
a
luncheon
later
in
the
day
high
living
in
the
afternoon
the
came
upon
a
large
turtle
asleep
on
the
sea
he
awoke
with
my
harpoon
through
his
neck
if
he
awoke
at
all
i
had
much
difficulty
in
landing
him
on
deck
which
i
finally
accomplished
by
hooking
the
to
one
of
his
flippers
for
he
was
about
as
heavy
as
my
boat
i
saw
more
turtles
and
i
rigged
a
burton
ready
with
which
to
hoist
them
in
for
i
was
obliged
to
lower
the
mainsail
whenever
the
halyards
were
used
for
such
purposes
and
it
was
no
small
matter
to
hoist
the
large
sail
again
but
the
was
good
i
found
no
fault
with
the
cook
and
it
was
the
rule
of
the
voyage
that
the
cook
found
no
fault
with
me
there
was
never
a
ship
crew
so
well
agreed
the
bill
of
fare
that
evening
was
tea
and
toast
fried
potatoes
stewed
onions
with
dessert
of
stewed
pears
and
cream
sometime
in
the
afternoon
i
passed
a
adrift
floating
light
on
the
water
it
was
painted
red
and
rigged
with
a
about
six
feet
high
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
coming
on
i
got
no
more
turtle
or
fish
of
any
sort
before
reaching
port
july
a
gale
sprang
up
suddenly
from
the
north
with
heavy
seas
and
i
shortened
sail
the
made
only
miles
on
her
course
that
day
august
the
gale
continued
with
heavy
seas
through
the
night
the
sloop
was
reaching
under
mainsail
and
bobbed
jib
at
the
jib
was
washed
off
the
bowsprit
and
blown
to
rags
and
ribbons
i
bent
the
jumbo
on
a
stay
at
the
as
for
the
jib
let
it
go
i
saved
pieces
of
it
and
after
all
i
was
in
want
of
on
august
the
gale
broke
and
i
saw
many
signs
of
land
bad
weather
having
made
itself
felt
in
the
galley
i
was
minded
to
try
my
hand
at
a
loaf
of
bread
and
so
rigging
a
pot
of
fire
on
deck
by
which
to
bake
it
a
loaf
soon
became
an
accomplished
fact
one
great
feature
about
ship
cooking
is
that
one
appetite
on
the
sea
is
always
good
a
fact
that
i
realized
when
i
cooked
for
the
crew
of
fishermen
in
the
boyhood
days
dinner
being
over
i
sat
for
hours
reading
the
life
of
columbus
and
as
the
day
wore
on
i
watched
the
birds
all
flying
in
one
direction
and
said
land
lies
there
early
the
next
morning
august
i
discovered
spain
i
saw
fires
on
shore
and
knew
that
the
country
was
inhabited
the
continued
on
her
course
till
well
in
with
the
land
which
was
that
about
trafalgar
then
keeping
away
a
point
she
passed
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
where
she
cast
anchor
at
of
the
same
day
less
than
days
from
cape
sable
at
the
finish
of
this
preliminary
trip
i
found
myself
in
excellent
health
not
overworked
or
cramped
but
as
well
as
ever
in
my
life
though
i
was
as
thin
as
a
illustration
coming
to
anchor
at
gibraltar
two
italian
barks
which
had
been
close
alongside
at
daylight
i
saw
long
after
i
had
anchored
passing
up
the
african
side
of
the
strait
the
had
sailed
them
both
hull
down
before
she
reached
tarifa
so
far
as
i
know
the
beat
everything
going
across
the
atlantic
except
the
steamers
all
was
well
but
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
a
bill
of
health
from
horta
and
so
when
the
fierce
old
port
doctor
came
to
inspect
there
was
a
row
that
however
was
the
very
thing
needed
if
you
want
to
get
on
well
with
a
true
britisher
you
must
first
have
a
deuce
of
a
row
with
him
i
knew
that
well
enough
and
so
i
fired
away
shot
for
shot
as
best
i
could
well
yes
the
doctor
admitted
at
last
your
crew
are
healthy
enough
no
doubt
but
who
knows
the
diseases
of
your
last
port
a
reasonable
enough
remark
we
ought
to
put
you
in
the
fort
sir
he
blustered
but
never
mind
free
pratique
sir
shove
off
cockswain
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
the
port
doctor
but
on
the
following
morning
a
much
longer
than
the
came
alongside
or
as
much
of
her
as
could
get
alongside
with
compliments
from
the
senior
naval
officer
admiral
bruce
saying
there
was
a
berth
for
the
at
the
arsenal
this
was
around
at
the
new
mole
i
had
anchored
at
the
old
mole
among
the
native
craft
where
it
was
rough
and
uncomfortable
of
course
i
was
glad
to
shift
and
did
so
as
soon
as
possible
thinking
of
the
great
company
the
would
be
in
among
such
as
the
and
which
were
at
that
time
stationed
there
and
on
board
all
of
which
i
was
entertained
later
most
royally
it
thar
as
the
americans
say
was
the
salute
i
got
from
admiral
bruce
when
i
called
at
the
admiralty
to
thank
him
for
his
courtesy
of
the
berth
and
for
the
use
of
the
which
towed
me
into
dock
about
the
berth
it
is
all
right
if
it
suits
and
tow
you
out
when
you
are
ready
to
go
but
say
what
repairs
do
you
want
ahoy
the
can
you
spare
your
sailmaker
the
wants
a
new
jib
construction
and
repair
there
will
you
see
to
the
say
old
man
you
must
have
knocked
the
devil
out
of
her
coming
over
alone
in
days
but
we
make
it
smooth
for
you
here
not
even
her
majesty
ship
the
was
better
looked
after
than
the
at
gibraltar
illustration
the
at
anchor
off
gibraltar
later
in
the
day
came
the
hail
ahoy
bruce
would
like
to
come
on
board
and
shake
hands
with
the
will
it
be
convenient
very
i
joyfully
shouted
on
the
following
day
sir
carrington
at
the
time
governor
of
gibraltar
with
other
high
officers
of
the
garrison
and
all
the
commanders
of
the
came
on
board
and
signed
their
names
in
the
again
there
was
a
hail
ahoy
hello
commander
reynolds
compliments
you
are
invited
on
board
home
at
not
later
than
i
had
already
hinted
at
the
limited
amount
of
my
wardrobe
and
that
i
could
never
succeed
as
a
dude
you
are
expected
sir
in
a
stovepipe
hat
and
a
coat
then
i
ca
come
dash
it
come
in
what
you
have
on
that
is
what
we
mean
aye
aye
sir
the
cheer
was
good
and
had
i
worn
a
silk
hat
as
high
as
the
moon
i
could
not
have
had
a
better
time
or
been
made
more
at
home
an
englishman
even
on
his
great
unbends
when
the
stranger
passes
his
gangway
and
when
he
says
at
home
he
means
it
that
one
should
like
gibraltar
would
go
without
saying
how
could
one
help
loving
so
hospitable
a
place
vegetables
twice
a
week
and
milk
every
morning
came
from
the
palatial
grounds
of
the
admiralty
ahoy
would
hail
the
admiral
ahoy
hello
is
your
vegetable
day
sir
aye
aye
sir
i
rambled
much
about
the
old
city
and
a
gunner
piloted
me
through
the
galleries
of
the
rock
as
far
as
a
stranger
is
permitted
to
go
there
is
no
excavation
in
the
world
for
military
purposes
at
all
approaching
these
of
gibraltar
in
conception
or
execution
viewing
the
stupendous
works
it
became
hard
to
realize
that
one
was
within
the
gibraltar
of
his
little
old
morse
geography
before
sailing
i
was
invited
on
a
picnic
with
the
governor
the
officers
of
the
garrison
and
the
commanders
of
the
at
the
station
and
a
royal
affair
it
was
no
going
knots
carried
our
party
to
the
morocco
shore
and
back
the
day
was
perfect
too
fine
in
fact
for
comfort
on
shore
and
so
no
one
landed
at
morocco
no
trembled
like
an
as
she
raced
through
the
sea
at
top
speed
sublieutenant
boucher
apparently
a
mere
lad
was
in
command
and
handled
his
ship
with
the
skill
of
an
older
sailor
on
the
following
day
i
lunched
with
general
carrington
the
governor
at
line
wall
house
which
was
once
the
franciscan
convent
in
this
interesting
edifice
are
preserved
relics
of
the
fourteen
sieges
which
gibraltar
has
seen
on
the
next
day
i
supped
with
the
admiral
at
his
residence
the
palace
which
was
once
the
convent
of
the
mercenaries
at
each
place
and
all
about
i
felt
the
friendly
grasp
of
a
manly
hand
that
lent
me
vital
strength
to
pass
the
coming
long
days
at
sea
i
must
confess
that
the
perfect
discipline
order
and
cheerfulness
at
gibraltar
were
only
a
second
wonder
in
the
great
stronghold
the
vast
amount
of
business
going
forward
caused
no
more
excitement
than
the
quiet
sailing
of
a
ship
in
a
smooth
sea
no
one
spoke
above
his
natural
voice
save
a
boatswain
mate
now
and
then
the
hon
horatio
sprague
the
venerable
united
states
consul
at
gibraltar
honored
the
with
a
visit
on
sunday
august
and
was
much
pleased
to
find
that
our
british
cousins
had
been
so
kind
to
her
chapter
v
sailing
from
gibraltar
with
the
assistance
of
her
majesty
tug
the
course
changed
from
the
suez
canal
to
cape
horn
chased
by
a
moorish
pirate
a
comparison
with
columbus
the
canary
cape
verde
islands
sea
life
arrival
at
pernambuco
a
bill
against
the
brazilian
government
preparing
for
the
stormy
weather
of
the
cape
monday
august
the
sailed
from
gibraltar
well
repaid
for
whatever
deviation
she
had
made
from
a
direct
course
to
reach
the
place
a
tug
belonging
to
her
majesty
towed
the
sloop
into
the
steady
breeze
clear
of
the
mount
where
her
sails
caught
a
volant
wind
which
carried
her
once
more
to
the
atlantic
where
it
rose
rapidly
to
a
furious
gale
my
plan
was
in
going
down
this
coast
to
haul
offshore
well
clear
of
the
land
which
hereabouts
is
the
home
of
pirates
but
i
had
hardly
accomplished
this
when
i
perceived
a
felucca
making
out
of
the
nearest
port
and
finally
following
in
the
wake
of
the
now
my
course
to
gibraltar
had
been
taken
with
a
view
to
proceed
up
the
mediterranean
sea
through
the
suez
canal
down
the
red
sea
and
east
about
instead
of
a
western
route
which
i
finally
adopted
by
officers
of
vast
experience
in
navigating
these
seas
i
was
influenced
to
make
the
change
longshore
pirates
on
both
coasts
being
numerous
i
could
not
afford
to
make
light
of
the
advice
but
here
i
was
after
all
evidently
in
the
midst
of
pirates
and
thieves
i
changed
my
course
the
felucca
did
the
same
both
vessels
sailing
very
fast
but
the
distance
growing
less
and
less
between
us
the
was
doing
nobly
she
was
even
more
than
at
her
best
but
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
she
would
broach
now
and
then
she
was
carrying
too
much
sail
for
safety
i
must
reef
or
be
dismasted
and
lose
all
pirate
or
no
pirate
i
must
reef
even
if
i
had
to
grapple
with
him
for
my
life
i
was
not
long
in
reefing
the
mainsail
and
sweating
it
up
probably
not
more
than
fifteen
minutes
but
the
felucca
had
in
the
meantime
so
shortened
the
distance
between
us
that
i
now
saw
the
tuft
of
hair
on
the
heads
of
the
crew
by
which
it
is
said
mohammed
will
pull
the
villains
up
into
heaven
and
they
were
coming
on
like
the
wind
from
what
i
could
clearly
make
out
now
i
felt
them
to
be
the
sons
of
generations
of
pirates
and
i
saw
by
their
movements
that
they
were
now
preparing
to
strike
a
blow
the
exultation
on
their
faces
however
was
changed
in
an
instant
to
a
look
of
fear
and
rage
their
craft
with
too
much
sail
on
broached
to
on
the
crest
of
a
great
wave
this
one
great
sea
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
suddenly
as
the
flash
of
a
gun
three
minutes
later
the
same
wave
overtook
the
and
shook
her
in
every
timber
at
the
same
moment
the
parted
and
away
went
the
broken
short
at
the
rigging
impulsively
i
sprang
to
the
and
and
instantly
downed
the
jib
the
being
off
and
the
helm
put
hard
down
the
sloop
came
in
the
wind
with
a
bound
while
shivering
there
but
a
moment
though
it
was
i
got
the
mainsail
down
and
secured
inboard
broken
boom
and
all
how
i
got
the
boom
in
before
the
sail
was
torn
i
hardly
know
but
not
a
stitch
of
it
was
broken
the
mainsail
being
secured
i
hoisted
away
the
jib
and
without
looking
round
stepped
quickly
to
the
cabin
and
snatched
down
my
loaded
rifle
and
cartridges
at
hand
for
i
made
mental
calculations
that
the
pirate
would
by
this
time
have
recovered
his
course
and
be
close
aboard
and
that
when
i
saw
him
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
looking
at
him
along
the
barrel
of
a
gun
the
piece
was
at
my
shoulder
when
i
peered
into
the
mist
but
there
was
no
pirate
within
a
mile
the
wave
and
squall
that
carried
away
my
boom
dismasted
the
felucca
outright
i
perceived
his
thieving
crew
some
dozen
or
more
of
them
struggling
to
recover
their
rigging
from
the
sea
allah
blacken
their
faces
i
sailed
comfortably
on
under
the
jib
and
forestaysail
which
i
now
set
i
fished
the
boom
and
furled
the
sail
snug
for
the
night
then
hauled
the
sloop
head
two
points
offshore
to
allow
for
the
set
of
current
and
heavy
rollers
toward
the
land
this
gave
me
the
wind
three
points
on
the
starboard
quarter
and
a
steady
pull
in
the
headsails
by
the
time
i
had
things
in
this
order
it
was
dark
and
a
had
already
fallen
on
deck
i
took
him
below
for
my
supper
but
found
myself
too
tired
to
cook
or
even
to
eat
a
thing
already
prepared
i
do
not
remember
to
have
been
more
tired
before
or
since
in
all
my
life
than
i
was
at
the
finish
of
that
day
too
fatigued
to
sleep
i
rolled
about
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
till
near
midnight
when
i
made
shift
to
dress
my
fish
and
prepare
a
dish
of
tea
i
fully
realized
now
if
i
had
not
before
that
the
voyage
ahead
would
call
for
exertions
ardent
and
lasting
on
august
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
moor
or
his
country
either
except
two
peaks
away
in
the
east
through
the
clear
atmosphere
of
morning
soon
after
the
sun
rose
even
these
were
obscured
by
haze
much
to
my
satisfaction
illustration
chased
by
pirates
the
wind
for
a
few
days
following
my
escape
from
the
pirates
blew
a
steady
but
moderate
gale
and
the
sea
though
agitated
into
long
rollers
was
not
uncomfortably
rough
or
dangerous
and
while
sitting
in
my
cabin
i
could
hardly
realize
that
any
sea
was
running
at
all
so
easy
was
the
long
swinging
motion
of
the
sloop
over
the
waves
all
distracting
uneasiness
and
excitement
being
now
over
i
was
once
more
alone
with
myself
in
the
realization
that
i
was
on
the
mighty
sea
and
in
the
hands
of
the
elements
but
i
was
happy
and
was
becoming
more
and
more
interested
in
the
voyage
columbus
in
the
sailing
these
seas
more
than
four
hundred
years
before
was
not
so
happy
as
i
nor
so
sure
of
success
in
what
he
had
undertaken
his
first
troubles
at
sea
had
already
begun
his
crew
had
managed
by
foul
play
or
otherwise
to
break
the
rudder
while
running
before
probably
just
such
a
gale
as
the
had
passed
through
and
there
was
dissension
on
the
something
that
was
unknown
on
the
after
three
days
of
squalls
and
shifting
winds
i
threw
myself
down
to
rest
and
sleep
while
with
helm
lashed
the
sloop
sailed
steadily
on
her
course
september
in
the
early
morning
rising
ahead
told
of
the
canary
islands
not
far
away
a
change
in
the
weather
came
next
day
stretched
their
arms
across
the
sky
from
the
east
to
all
appearances
might
come
a
fierce
harmattan
or
from
the
south
might
come
the
fierce
hurricane
every
point
of
the
compass
threatened
a
wild
storm
my
attention
was
turned
to
reefing
sails
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
over
it
either
for
the
sea
in
a
moment
was
confusion
itself
and
i
was
glad
to
head
the
sloop
three
points
or
more
away
from
her
true
course
that
she
might
ride
safely
over
the
waves
i
was
now
scudding
her
for
the
channel
between
africa
and
the
island
of
fuerteventura
the
easternmost
of
the
canary
islands
for
which
i
was
on
the
lookout
at
the
weather
becoming
suddenly
fine
the
island
stood
in
view
already
abeam
to
starboard
and
not
more
than
seven
miles
off
fuerteventura
is
hundred
feet
high
and
in
fine
weather
is
visible
many
leagues
away
the
wind
freshened
in
the
night
and
the
had
a
fine
run
through
the
channel
by
daylight
september
she
was
miles
clear
of
all
the
islands
when
a
calm
ensued
which
was
the
precursor
of
another
gale
of
wind
that
soon
came
on
bringing
with
it
dust
from
the
african
shore
it
howled
dismally
while
it
lasted
and
though
it
was
not
the
season
of
the
harmattan
the
sea
in
the
course
of
an
hour
was
discolored
with
a
dust
the
air
remained
thick
with
flying
dust
all
the
afternoon
but
the
wind
veering
northwest
at
night
swept
it
back
to
land
and
afforded
the
once
more
a
clear
sky
her
mast
now
bent
under
a
strong
steady
pressure
and
her
bellying
sail
swept
the
sea
as
she
rolled
scuppers
under
courtesying
to
the
waves
these
rolling
waves
thrilled
me
as
they
tossed
my
ship
passing
quickly
under
her
keel
this
was
grand
sailing
september
the
wind
still
fresh
blew
from
the
and
the
sea
surged
along
with
the
sloop
about
noon
a
steamship
a
from
the
river
plate
hove
in
sight
steering
northeast
and
making
bad
weather
of
it
i
signaled
her
but
got
no
answer
she
was
plunging
into
the
head
sea
and
rolling
in
a
most
astonishing
manner
and
from
the
way
she
yawed
one
might
have
said
that
a
wild
steer
was
at
the
helm
on
the
morning
of
september
i
found
three
on
deck
and
a
fourth
one
down
the
as
close
as
possible
to
the
it
was
the
best
haul
yet
and
afforded
me
a
sumptuous
breakfast
and
dinner
the
had
now
settled
down
to
the
tradewinds
and
to
the
business
of
her
voyage
later
in
the
day
another
droger
hove
in
sight
rolling
as
badly
as
her
predecessor
i
threw
out
no
flag
to
this
one
but
got
the
worst
of
it
for
passing
under
her
lee
she
was
indeed
a
stale
one
and
the
poor
cattle
how
they
bellowed
the
time
was
when
ships
passing
one
another
at
sea
backed
their
topsails
and
had
a
gam
and
on
parting
fired
guns
but
those
good
old
days
have
gone
people
have
hardly
time
nowadays
to
speak
even
on
the
broad
ocean
where
news
is
news
and
as
for
a
salute
of
guns
they
can
not
afford
the
powder
there
are
no
freighters
on
the
sea
now
it
is
a
prosy
life
when
we
have
no
time
to
bid
one
another
good
morning
my
ship
running
now
in
the
full
swing
of
the
trades
left
me
days
to
myself
for
rest
and
recuperation
i
employed
the
time
in
reading
and
writing
or
in
whatever
i
found
to
do
about
the
rigging
and
the
sails
to
keep
them
all
in
order
the
cooking
was
always
done
quickly
and
was
a
small
matter
as
the
bill
of
fare
consisted
mostly
of
hot
biscuits
and
butter
potatoes
coffee
and
cream
dishes
readily
prepared
on
september
the
passed
the
island
of
antonio
the
northwesternmost
of
the
cape
verdes
close
aboard
the
landfall
was
wonderfully
true
considering
that
no
observations
for
longitude
had
been
made
the
wind
northeast
as
the
sloop
drew
by
the
island
was
very
squally
but
i
reefed
her
sails
snug
and
steered
broad
from
the
highland
of
blustering
antonio
then
leaving
the
cape
verde
islands
out
of
sight
astern
i
found
myself
once
more
sailing
a
lonely
sea
and
in
a
solitude
supreme
all
around
when
i
slept
i
dreamed
that
i
was
alone
this
feeling
never
left
me
but
sleeping
or
waking
i
seemed
always
to
know
the
position
of
the
sloop
and
i
saw
my
vessel
moving
across
the
chart
which
became
a
picture
before
me
one
night
while
i
sat
in
the
cabin
under
this
spell
the
profound
stillness
all
about
was
broken
by
human
voices
alongside
i
sprang
instantly
to
the
deck
startled
beyond
my
power
to
tell
passing
close
under
lee
like
an
apparition
was
a
white
bark
under
full
sail
the
sailors
on
board
of
her
were
hauling
on
ropes
to
brace
the
yards
which
just
cleared
the
sloop
mast
as
she
swept
by
no
one
hailed
from
the
flier
but
i
heard
some
one
on
board
say
that
he
saw
lights
on
the
sloop
and
that
he
made
her
out
to
be
a
fisherman
i
sat
long
on
the
starlit
deck
that
night
thinking
of
ships
and
watching
the
constellations
on
their
voyage
on
the
following
day
september
a
large
ship
passed
some
distance
to
windward
heading
north
the
sloop
was
now
rapidly
drawing
toward
the
region
of
doldrums
and
the
force
of
the
was
lessening
i
could
see
by
the
ripples
that
a
had
set
in
this
i
estimated
to
be
about
sixteen
miles
a
day
in
the
heart
of
the
the
rate
was
more
than
that
setting
eastward
september
a
lofty
ship
heading
north
was
seen
from
the
masthead
neither
this
ship
nor
the
one
seen
yesterday
was
within
signal
distance
yet
it
was
good
even
to
see
them
on
the
following
day
heavy
rose
in
the
south
obscuring
the
sun
this
was
ominous
of
doldrums
on
the
the
entered
this
gloomy
region
to
battle
with
squalls
and
to
be
harassed
by
fitful
calms
for
this
is
the
state
of
the
elements
between
the
northeast
and
the
southeast
trades
where
each
wind
struggling
in
turn
for
mastery
expends
its
force
whirling
about
in
all
directions
making
this
still
more
trying
to
one
nerve
and
patience
the
sea
was
tossed
into
confused
and
fretted
by
eddying
currents
as
if
something
more
were
needed
to
complete
a
sailor
discomfort
in
this
state
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
day
and
night
the
struggled
and
tossed
for
ten
days
making
only
three
hundred
miles
on
her
course
in
all
that
time
i
did
say
anything
on
september
the
fine
schooner
of
boston
from
bear
river
for
the
river
plate
and
just
through
the
doldrums
came
up
with
the
and
her
captain
passing
a
few
words
she
sailed
on
being
much
fouled
on
the
bottom
by
she
drew
along
with
her
fishes
which
had
been
following
the
which
was
less
provided
with
that
sort
of
food
fishes
will
always
follow
a
foul
ship
a
log
adrift
has
the
same
attraction
for
fishes
one
of
this
little
school
of
deserters
was
a
dolphin
that
had
followed
the
about
a
thousand
miles
and
had
been
content
to
eat
scraps
of
food
thrown
overboard
from
my
table
for
having
been
wounded
it
could
not
dart
through
the
sea
to
prey
on
other
fishes
i
had
become
accustomed
to
seeing
the
dolphin
which
i
knew
by
its
scars
and
missed
it
whenever
it
took
occasional
excursions
away
from
the
sloop
one
day
after
it
had
been
off
some
hours
it
returned
in
company
with
three
yellowtails
a
sort
of
cousin
to
the
dolphin
this
little
school
kept
together
except
when
in
danger
and
when
foraging
about
the
sea
their
lives
were
often
threatened
by
hungry
sharks
that
came
round
the
vessel
and
more
than
once
they
had
narrow
escapes
their
mode
of
escape
interested
me
greatly
and
i
passed
hours
watching
them
they
would
dart
away
each
in
a
different
direction
so
that
the
wolf
of
the
sea
the
shark
pursuing
one
would
be
led
away
from
the
others
then
after
a
while
they
would
all
return
and
rendezvous
under
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
sloop
twice
their
pursuers
were
diverted
by
a
tin
pan
which
i
towed
astern
of
the
sloop
and
which
was
mistaken
for
a
bright
fish
and
while
turning
in
the
peculiar
way
that
sharks
have
when
about
to
devour
their
prey
i
shot
them
through
the
head
their
precarious
life
seemed
to
concern
the
yellowtails
very
little
if
at
all
all
living
beings
without
doubt
are
afraid
of
death
nevertheless
some
of
the
species
i
saw
huddle
together
as
though
they
knew
they
were
created
for
the
larger
fishes
and
wished
to
give
the
least
possible
trouble
to
their
captors
i
have
seen
on
the
other
hand
whales
swimming
in
a
circle
around
a
school
of
herrings
and
with
mighty
exertion
bunching
them
together
in
a
whirlpool
set
in
motion
by
their
flukes
and
when
the
small
fry
were
all
whirled
nicely
together
one
or
the
other
of
the
leviathans
lunging
through
the
center
with
open
jaws
take
in
a
or
so
at
a
single
mouthful
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
saw
schools
of
sardines
or
other
small
fish
being
treated
in
this
way
by
great
numbers
of
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
escape
for
the
sardines
while
the
cavally
circled
round
and
round
feeding
from
the
edge
of
the
mass
it
was
interesting
to
note
how
rapidly
the
small
fry
disappeared
and
though
it
was
repeated
before
my
eyes
over
and
over
i
could
hardly
perceive
the
capture
of
a
single
sardine
so
dexterously
was
it
done
along
the
equatorial
limit
of
the
southeast
trade
winds
the
air
was
heavily
charged
with
electricity
and
there
was
much
thunder
and
lightning
it
was
hereabout
i
remembered
that
a
few
years
before
the
american
ship
was
destroyed
by
lightning
her
people
by
wonderful
good
fortune
were
rescued
on
the
same
day
and
brought
to
pernambuco
where
i
then
met
them
on
september
in
the
latitude
of
degrees
longitude
degrees
i
spoke
the
ship
of
london
the
great
ship
was
out
days
from
norfolk
virginia
and
was
bound
for
rio
where
we
met
again
about
two
months
later
the
was
now
thirty
days
from
gibraltar
the
next
companion
of
the
voyage
was
a
swordfish
that
swam
alongside
showing
its
tall
fin
out
of
the
water
till
i
made
a
stir
for
my
harpoon
when
it
hauled
its
black
flag
down
and
disappeared
september
at
eleven
in
the
morning
the
crossed
the
equator
in
longitude
degrees
at
noon
she
was
two
miles
south
of
the
line
the
southeast
met
rather
light
in
about
degrees
gave
her
sails
now
a
stiff
full
sending
her
handsomely
over
the
sea
toward
the
coast
of
brazil
where
on
october
just
north
of
olinda
point
without
further
incident
she
made
the
land
casting
anchor
in
pernambuco
harbor
about
noon
forty
days
from
gibraltar
and
all
well
on
board
did
i
tire
of
the
voyage
in
all
that
time
not
a
bit
of
it
i
was
never
in
better
trim
in
all
my
life
and
was
eager
for
the
more
perilous
experience
of
rounding
the
horn
it
was
not
at
all
strange
in
a
life
common
to
sailors
that
having
already
crossed
the
atlantic
twice
and
being
now
from
boston
to
the
horn
i
should
find
myself
still
among
friends
my
determination
to
sail
westward
from
gibraltar
not
only
enabled
me
to
escape
the
pirates
of
the
red
sea
but
in
bringing
me
to
pernambuco
landed
me
on
familiar
shores
i
had
made
many
voyages
to
this
and
other
ports
in
brazil
in
i
was
employed
as
master
to
take
the
famous
ericsson
ship
from
new
york
to
brazil
to
go
against
the
rebel
mello
and
his
party
the
by
the
way
carried
a
submarine
cannon
of
enormous
length
in
the
same
expedition
went
the
the
ship
purchased
by
the
united
states
government
during
the
spanish
war
and
renamed
the
the
was
in
many
ways
the
better
ship
of
the
two
but
the
brazilians
in
their
curious
war
sank
her
themselves
at
bahia
with
her
sank
my
hope
of
recovering
wages
due
me
still
i
could
but
try
to
recover
for
to
me
it
meant
a
great
deal
but
now
within
two
years
the
whirligig
of
time
had
brought
the
mello
party
into
power
and
although
it
was
the
legal
government
which
had
employed
me
the
rebels
felt
under
less
obligation
to
me
than
i
could
have
wished
during
these
visits
to
brazil
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
perera
owner
and
editor
of
el
commercio
jornal
and
soon
after
the
was
safely
moored
in
upper
topsail
reach
the
doctor
who
is
a
very
enthusiastic
yachtsman
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
and
to
carry
me
up
the
waterway
of
the
lagoon
to
his
country
residence
the
approach
to
his
mansion
by
the
waterside
was
guarded
by
his
armada
a
fleet
of
boats
including
a
chinese
sampan
a
norwegian
pram
and
a
cape
ann
dory
the
last
of
which
he
obtained
from
the
the
doctor
dined
me
often
on
good
brazilian
fare
that
i
might
as
he
said
salle
gordo
for
the
voyage
but
he
found
that
even
on
the
best
i
fattened
slowly
fruits
and
vegetables
and
all
other
provisions
necessary
for
the
voyage
having
been
taken
in
on
the
of
october
i
unmoored
and
made
ready
for
sea
here
i
encountered
one
of
the
unforgiving
mello
faction
in
the
person
of
the
collector
of
customs
who
charged
the
tonnage
dues
when
she
cleared
notwithstanding
that
she
sailed
with
a
yacht
license
and
should
have
been
exempt
from
port
charges
our
consul
reminded
the
collector
of
this
and
of
the
fact
without
much
diplomacy
i
thought
that
it
was
i
who
brought
the
to
brazil
oh
yes
said
the
bland
collector
we
remember
it
very
well
for
it
was
now
in
a
small
way
his
turn
lungrin
a
merchant
to
help
me
out
of
the
trifling
difficulty
offered
to
freight
the
with
a
cargo
of
gunpowder
for
bahia
which
would
have
put
me
in
funds
and
when
the
insurance
companies
refused
to
take
the
risk
on
cargo
shipped
on
a
vessel
manned
by
a
crew
of
only
one
he
offered
to
ship
it
without
insurance
taking
all
the
risk
himself
this
was
perhaps
paying
me
a
greater
compliment
than
i
deserved
the
reason
why
i
did
not
accept
the
business
was
that
in
so
doing
i
found
that
i
should
vitiate
my
yacht
license
and
run
into
more
expense
for
harbor
dues
around
the
world
than
the
freight
would
amount
to
instead
of
all
this
another
old
merchant
friend
came
to
my
assistance
advancing
the
cash
direct
while
at
pernambuco
i
shortened
the
boom
which
had
been
broken
when
off
the
coast
of
morocco
by
removing
the
broken
piece
which
took
about
four
feet
off
the
inboard
end
i
also
refitted
the
jaws
on
october
a
fine
day
even
as
days
go
in
brazil
the
sailed
having
had
abundant
good
cheer
making
about
one
hundred
miles
a
day
along
the
coast
i
arrived
at
rio
de
janeiro
november
without
any
event
worth
mentioning
and
about
noon
cast
anchor
near
villaganon
to
await
the
official
port
visit
on
the
following
day
i
bestirred
myself
to
meet
the
highest
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
the
ministers
to
inquire
concerning
the
matter
of
wages
due
me
from
the
beloved
the
high
official
i
met
said
captain
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
you
may
have
the
ship
and
if
you
care
to
accept
her
we
will
send
an
officer
to
show
you
where
she
is
i
knew
well
enough
where
she
was
at
that
moment
the
top
of
her
being
awash
in
bahia
it
was
more
than
likely
that
she
rested
on
the
bottom
there
i
thanked
the
kind
officer
but
declined
his
offer
the
with
a
number
of
old
shipmasters
on
board
sailed
about
the
harbor
of
rio
the
day
before
she
put
to
sea
as
i
had
decided
to
give
the
a
yawl
rig
for
the
tempestuous
waters
of
patagonia
i
here
placed
on
the
stern
a
semicircular
brace
to
support
a
jigger
mast
these
old
captains
inspected
the
rigging
and
each
one
contributed
something
to
her
outfit
captain
jones
who
had
acted
as
my
interpreter
at
rio
gave
her
an
anchor
and
one
of
the
steamers
gave
her
a
cable
to
match
it
she
never
dragged
jones
anchor
once
on
the
voyage
and
the
cable
not
only
stood
the
strain
on
a
lee
shore
but
when
towed
off
cape
horn
helped
break
combing
seas
astern
that
threatened
to
board
her
chapter
vi
departure
from
rio
de
janeiro
the
ashore
on
the
sands
of
uruguay
a
narrow
escape
from
shipwreck
the
boy
who
found
a
sloop
the
floated
but
somewhat
damaged
courtesies
from
the
british
consul
at
maldonado
a
warm
greeting
at
montevideo
an
excursion
to
buenos
aires
shortening
the
mast
and
bowsprit
on
november
the
sailed
from
rio
de
janeiro
and
first
of
all
ran
into
a
gale
of
wind
which
tore
up
things
generally
along
the
coast
doing
considerable
damage
to
shipping
it
was
well
for
her
perhaps
that
she
was
clear
of
the
land
coasting
along
on
this
part
of
the
voyage
i
observed
that
while
some
of
the
small
vessels
i
fell
in
with
were
able
to
outsail
the
by
day
they
fell
astern
of
her
by
night
to
the
day
and
night
were
the
same
to
the
others
clearly
there
was
a
difference
on
one
of
the
very
fine
days
experienced
after
leaving
rio
the
steamship
spoke
the
and
unsolicited
gave
the
longitude
by
chronometer
as
degrees
as
near
as
i
can
make
it
the
captain
said
the
with
her
tin
clock
had
exactly
the
same
reckoning
i
was
feeling
at
ease
in
my
primitive
method
of
navigation
but
it
startled
me
not
a
little
to
find
my
position
by
account
verified
by
the
chronometer
on
december
a
barkantine
hove
in
sight
and
for
several
days
the
two
vessels
sailed
along
the
coast
together
right
here
a
current
was
experienced
setting
north
making
it
necessary
to
hug
the
shore
with
which
the
became
rather
familiar
here
i
confess
a
weakness
i
hugged
the
shore
entirely
too
close
in
a
word
at
daybreak
on
the
morning
of
december
the
ran
hard
and
fast
on
the
beach
this
was
annoying
but
i
soon
found
that
the
sloop
was
in
no
great
danger
the
false
appearance
of
the
under
a
bright
moon
had
deceived
me
and
i
lamented
now
that
i
had
trusted
to
appearances
at
all
the
sea
though
moderately
smooth
still
carried
a
swell
which
broke
with
some
force
on
the
shore
i
managed
to
launch
my
small
dory
from
the
deck
and
ran
out
a
and
warp
but
it
was
too
late
to
kedge
the
sloop
off
for
the
tide
was
falling
and
she
had
already
sewed
a
foot
then
i
went
about
laying
out
the
larger
anchor
which
was
no
easy
matter
for
my
only
the
frail
dory
when
the
anchor
and
cable
were
in
it
was
swamped
at
once
in
the
surf
the
load
being
too
great
for
her
then
i
cut
the
cable
and
made
two
loads
of
it
instead
of
one
the
anchor
with
forty
fathoms
bent
and
already
buoyed
i
now
took
and
succeeded
in
getting
through
the
surf
but
my
dory
was
leaking
fast
and
by
the
time
i
had
rowed
far
enough
to
drop
the
anchor
she
was
full
to
the
gunwale
and
sinking
there
was
not
a
moment
to
spare
and
i
saw
clearly
that
if
i
failed
now
all
might
be
lost
i
sprang
from
the
oars
to
my
feet
and
lifting
the
anchor
above
my
head
threw
it
clear
just
as
she
was
turning
over
i
grasped
her
gunwale
and
held
on
as
she
turned
bottom
up
for
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
could
not
swim
then
i
tried
to
right
her
but
with
too
much
eagerness
for
she
rolled
clean
over
and
left
me
as
before
clinging
to
her
gunwale
while
my
body
was
still
in
the
water
giving
a
moment
to
cool
reflection
i
found
that
although
the
wind
was
blowing
moderately
toward
the
land
the
current
was
carrying
me
to
sea
and
that
something
would
have
to
be
done
three
times
i
had
been
under
water
in
trying
to
right
the
dory
and
i
was
just
saying
now
i
lay
me
when
i
was
seized
by
a
determination
to
try
yet
once
more
so
that
no
one
of
the
prophets
of
evil
i
had
left
behind
me
could
say
i
told
you
so
whatever
the
danger
may
have
been
much
or
little
i
can
truly
say
that
the
moment
was
the
most
serene
of
my
life
illustration
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
could
not
swim
after
righting
the
dory
for
the
fourth
time
i
finally
succeeded
by
the
utmost
care
in
keeping
her
upright
while
i
hauled
myself
into
her
and
with
one
of
the
oars
which
i
had
recovered
paddled
to
the
shore
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
and
pretty
full
of
salt
water
the
position
of
my
vessel
now
high
and
dry
gave
me
anxiety
to
get
her
afloat
again
was
all
i
thought
of
or
cared
for
i
had
little
difficulty
in
carrying
the
second
part
of
my
cable
out
and
securing
it
to
the
first
which
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
buoy
before
i
put
it
into
the
boat
to
bring
the
end
back
to
the
sloop
was
a
smaller
matter
still
and
i
believe
i
chuckled
above
my
sorrows
when
i
found
that
in
all
the
haphazard
my
judgment
or
my
good
genius
had
faithfully
stood
by
me
the
cable
reached
from
the
anchor
in
deep
water
to
the
windlass
by
just
enough
to
secure
a
turn
and
no
more
the
anchor
had
been
dropped
at
the
right
distance
from
the
vessel
to
heave
all
taut
now
and
wait
for
the
coming
tide
was
all
i
could
do
i
had
already
done
enough
work
to
tire
a
stouter
man
and
was
only
too
glad
to
throw
myself
on
the
sand
above
the
tide
and
rest
for
the
sun
was
already
up
and
pouring
a
generous
warmth
over
the
land
while
my
state
could
have
been
worse
i
was
on
the
wild
coast
of
a
foreign
country
and
not
entirely
secure
in
my
property
as
i
soon
found
out
i
had
not
been
long
on
the
shore
when
i
heard
the
patter
patter
of
a
horse
feet
approaching
along
the
hard
beach
which
ceased
as
it
came
abreast
of
the
where
i
lay
sheltered
from
the
wind
looking
up
cautiously
i
saw
mounted
on
a
nag
probably
the
most
astonished
boy
on
the
whole
coast
he
had
found
a
sloop
it
must
be
mine
he
thought
for
am
i
not
the
first
to
see
it
on
the
beach
sure
enough
there
it
was
all
high
and
dry
and
painted
white
he
trotted
his
horse
around
it
and
finding
no
owner
hitched
the
nag
to
the
bobstay
and
hauled
as
though
he
would
take
her
home
but
of
course
she
was
too
heavy
for
one
horse
to
move
with
my
skiff
however
it
was
different
this
he
hauled
some
distance
and
concealed
behind
a
dune
in
a
bunch
of
tall
grass
he
had
made
up
his
mind
i
dare
say
to
bring
more
horses
and
drag
his
bigger
prize
away
anyhow
and
was
starting
off
for
the
settlement
a
mile
or
so
away
for
the
reinforcement
when
i
discovered
myself
to
him
at
which
he
seemed
displeased
and
disappointed
buenos
dias
muchacho
i
said
he
grunted
a
reply
and
eyed
me
keenly
from
head
to
foot
then
bursting
into
a
volley
of
questions
more
than
six
yankees
could
ask
he
wanted
to
know
first
where
my
ship
was
from
and
how
many
days
she
had
been
coming
then
he
asked
what
i
was
doing
here
ashore
so
early
in
the
morning
your
questions
are
easily
answered
i
replied
my
ship
is
from
the
moon
it
has
taken
her
a
month
to
come
and
she
is
here
for
a
cargo
of
boys
but
the
intimation
of
this
enterprise
had
i
not
been
on
the
alert
might
have
cost
me
dearly
for
while
i
spoke
this
child
of
the
campo
coiled
his
lariat
ready
to
throw
and
instead
of
being
himself
carried
to
the
moon
he
was
apparently
thinking
of
towing
me
home
by
the
neck
astern
of
his
wild
cayuse
over
the
fields
of
uruguay
the
exact
spot
where
i
was
stranded
was
at
the
castillo
chicos
about
seven
miles
south
of
the
of
uruguay
and
brazil
and
of
course
the
natives
there
speak
spanish
to
reconcile
my
early
visitor
i
told
him
that
i
had
on
my
ship
biscuits
and
that
i
wished
to
trade
them
for
butter
and
milk
on
hearing
this
a
broad
grin
lighted
up
his
face
and
showed
that
he
was
greatly
interested
and
that
even
in
uruguay
a
ship
biscuit
will
cheer
the
heart
of
a
boy
and
make
him
your
bosom
friend
the
lad
almost
flew
home
and
returned
quickly
with
butter
milk
and
eggs
i
was
after
all
in
a
land
of
plenty
with
the
boy
came
others
old
and
young
from
neighboring
ranches
among
them
a
german
settler
who
was
of
great
assistance
to
me
in
many
ways
illustration
a
double
surprise
a
from
fort
teresa
a
few
miles
away
also
came
to
protect
your
property
from
the
natives
of
the
plains
he
said
i
took
occasion
to
tell
him
however
that
if
he
would
look
after
the
people
of
his
own
village
i
would
take
care
of
those
from
the
plains
pointing
as
i
spoke
to
the
nondescript
merchant
who
had
already
stolen
my
revolver
and
several
small
articles
from
my
cabin
which
by
a
bold
front
i
had
recovered
the
chap
was
not
a
native
uruguayan
here
as
in
many
other
places
that
i
visited
the
natives
themselves
were
not
the
ones
discreditable
to
the
country
early
in
the
day
a
despatch
came
from
the
port
captain
of
montevideo
commanding
the
coastguards
to
render
the
every
assistance
this
however
was
not
necessary
for
a
guard
was
already
on
the
alert
and
making
all
the
ado
that
would
become
the
wreck
of
a
steamer
with
a
thousand
emigrants
aboard
the
same
messenger
brought
word
from
the
port
captain
that
he
would
despatch
a
to
tow
the
to
montevideo
the
officer
was
as
good
as
his
word
a
powerful
tug
arrived
on
the
following
day
but
to
make
a
long
story
short
with
the
help
of
the
german
and
one
soldier
and
one
italian
called
angel
of
milan
i
had
already
floated
the
sloop
and
was
sailing
for
port
with
the
boom
off
before
a
fair
wind
the
adventure
cost
the
no
small
amount
of
pounding
on
the
hard
sand
she
lost
her
shoe
and
part
of
her
false
keel
and
received
other
damage
which
however
was
readily
mended
afterward
in
dock
on
the
following
day
i
anchored
at
maldonado
the
british
consul
his
daughter
and
another
young
lady
came
on
board
bringing
with
them
a
basket
of
fresh
eggs
strawberries
bottles
of
milk
and
a
great
loaf
of
sweet
bread
this
was
a
good
landfall
and
better
cheer
than
i
had
found
at
maldonado
once
upon
a
time
when
i
entered
the
port
with
a
stricken
crew
in
my
bark
the
in
the
waters
of
maldonado
bay
a
variety
of
fishes
abound
and
in
their
season
haul
out
on
the
island
abreast
the
bay
to
breed
currents
on
this
coast
are
greatly
affected
by
the
prevailing
winds
and
a
tidal
wave
higher
than
that
ordinarily
produced
by
the
moon
is
sent
up
the
whole
shore
of
uruguay
before
a
southwest
gale
or
lowered
by
a
northeaster
as
may
happen
one
of
these
waves
having
just
receded
before
the
northeast
wind
which
brought
the
in
left
the
tide
now
at
low
ebb
with
laid
bare
for
some
distance
along
the
shore
other
shellfish
of
good
flavor
were
also
plentiful
though
small
in
size
i
gathered
a
mess
of
oysters
and
mussels
here
while
a
native
with
hook
and
line
and
with
mussels
for
bait
fished
from
a
point
of
detached
rocks
for
bream
landing
several
ones
the
fisherman
nephew
a
lad
about
seven
years
old
deserves
mention
as
the
tallest
blasphemer
for
a
short
boy
that
i
met
on
the
voyage
he
called
his
old
uncle
all
the
vile
names
under
the
sun
for
not
helping
him
across
the
gully
while
he
swore
roundly
in
all
the
moods
and
tenses
of
the
spanish
language
his
uncle
fished
on
now
and
then
congratulating
his
hopeful
nephew
on
his
accomplishment
at
the
end
of
his
rich
vocabulary
the
urchin
sauntered
off
into
the
fields
and
shortly
returned
with
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
with
all
smiles
handed
them
to
me
with
the
innocence
of
an
angel
i
remembered
having
seen
the
same
flower
on
the
banks
of
the
river
farther
up
some
years
before
i
asked
the
young
pirate
why
he
had
brought
them
to
me
said
he
i
do
know
i
only
wished
to
do
so
whatever
the
influence
was
that
put
so
amiable
a
wish
in
this
wild
pampa
boy
it
must
be
thought
i
and
potent
seas
over
shortly
after
the
sailed
for
montevideo
where
she
arrived
on
the
following
day
and
was
greeted
by
till
i
felt
embarrassed
and
wished
that
i
had
arrived
unobserved
the
voyage
so
far
alone
may
have
seemed
to
the
uruguayans
a
feat
worthy
of
some
recognition
but
there
was
so
much
of
it
yet
ahead
and
of
such
an
arduous
nature
that
any
demonstration
at
this
point
seemed
somehow
like
boasting
prematurely
the
had
barely
come
to
anchor
at
montevideo
when
the
agents
of
the
royal
mail
steamship
company
humphreys
sent
word
that
they
would
dock
and
repair
her
free
of
expense
and
give
me
twenty
pounds
sterling
which
they
did
to
the
letter
and
more
besides
the
calkers
at
montevideo
paid
very
careful
attention
to
the
work
of
making
the
sloop
tight
carpenters
mended
the
keel
and
also
the
the
dory
painting
it
till
i
hardly
knew
it
from
a
butterfly
christmas
of
found
the
refitted
even
to
a
wonderful
makeshift
stove
which
was
contrived
from
a
large
iron
drum
of
some
sort
punched
full
of
holes
to
give
it
a
draft
the
pipe
reached
straight
up
through
the
top
of
the
forecastle
now
this
was
not
a
stove
by
mere
courtesy
it
was
always
hungry
even
for
green
wood
and
in
cold
wet
days
off
the
coast
of
tierra
del
fuego
it
stood
me
in
good
stead
its
one
door
swung
on
copper
hinges
which
one
of
the
yard
apprentices
with
laudable
pride
polished
till
the
whole
thing
blushed
like
the
brass
binnacle
of
a
steamer
the
was
now
ready
for
sea
instead
of
proceeding
at
once
on
her
voyage
however
she
made
an
excursion
up
the
river
sailing
december
an
old
friend
of
mine
captain
howard
of
cape
cod
and
of
river
plate
fame
took
the
trip
in
her
to
buenos
aires
where
she
arrived
early
on
the
following
day
with
a
gale
of
wind
and
a
current
so
much
in
her
favor
that
she
outdid
herself
i
was
glad
to
have
a
sailor
of
howard
experience
on
board
to
witness
her
performance
of
sailing
with
no
living
being
at
the
helm
howard
sat
near
the
binnacle
and
watched
the
compass
while
the
sloop
held
her
course
so
steadily
that
one
would
have
declared
that
the
card
was
nailed
fast
not
a
quarter
of
a
point
did
she
deviate
from
her
course
my
old
friend
had
owned
and
sailed
a
on
the
river
for
many
years
but
this
feat
took
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
at
last
and
he
cried
i
be
stranded
on
chico
bank
if
ever
i
saw
the
like
of
it
perhaps
he
had
never
given
his
sloop
a
chance
to
show
what
she
could
do
the
point
i
make
for
the
here
above
all
other
points
is
that
she
sailed
in
shoal
water
and
in
a
strong
current
with
other
difficult
and
unusual
conditions
captain
howard
took
all
this
into
account
in
all
the
years
away
from
his
native
home
howard
had
not
forgotten
the
art
of
making
fish
chowders
and
to
prove
this
he
brought
along
some
fine
rockfish
and
prepared
a
mess
fit
for
kings
when
the
savory
chowder
was
done
chocking
the
pot
securely
between
two
boxes
on
the
cabin
floor
so
that
it
could
not
roll
over
we
helped
ourselves
and
swapped
yarns
over
it
while
the
made
her
own
way
through
the
darkness
on
the
river
howard
told
me
stories
about
the
fuegian
cannibals
as
she
reeled
along
and
i
told
him
about
the
pilot
of
the
steering
my
vessel
through
the
storm
off
the
coast
of
the
azores
and
that
i
looked
for
him
at
the
helm
in
a
gale
such
as
this
i
do
not
charge
howard
with
superstition
we
are
none
of
us
superstitious
but
when
i
spoke
about
his
returning
to
montevideo
on
the
he
shook
his
head
and
took
a
instead
i
had
not
been
in
buenos
aires
for
a
number
of
years
the
place
where
i
had
once
landed
from
packets
in
a
cart
was
now
built
up
with
magnificent
docks
vast
fortunes
had
been
spent
in
remodeling
the
harbor
london
bankers
could
tell
you
that
the
port
captain
after
assigning
the
a
safe
berth
with
his
compliments
sent
me
word
to
call
on
him
for
anything
i
might
want
while
in
port
and
i
felt
quite
sure
that
his
friendship
was
sincere
the
sloop
was
well
cared
for
at
buenos
aires
her
dockage
and
tonnage
dues
were
all
free
and
the
yachting
fraternity
of
the
city
welcomed
her
with
a
good
will
in
town
i
found
things
not
so
greatly
changed
as
about
the
docks
and
i
soon
felt
myself
more
at
home
from
montevideo
i
had
forwarded
a
letter
from
sir
edward
hairby
to
the
owner
of
the
standard
mulhall
and
in
reply
to
it
was
assured
of
a
warm
welcome
to
the
warmest
heart
i
think
outside
of
ireland
mulhall
with
a
prancing
team
came
down
to
the
docks
as
soon
as
the
was
berthed
and
would
have
me
go
to
his
house
at
once
where
a
room
was
waiting
and
it
was
new
year
day
the
course
of
the
spray
had
been
followed
in
the
columns
of
the
standard
mulhall
kindly
drove
me
to
see
many
improvements
about
the
city
and
we
went
in
search
of
some
of
the
old
landmarks
the
man
who
sold
lemonade
on
the
plaza
when
first
i
visited
this
wonderful
city
i
found
selling
lemonade
still
at
two
cents
a
glass
he
had
made
a
fortune
by
it
his
stock
in
trade
was
a
and
a
neighboring
hydrant
a
moderate
supply
of
brown
sugar
and
about
six
lemons
that
floated
on
the
sweetened
water
the
water
from
time
to
time
was
renewed
from
the
friendly
pump
but
the
lemon
went
on
forever
and
all
at
two
cents
a
glass
illustration
at
the
sign
of
the
comet
but
we
looked
in
vain
for
the
man
who
once
sold
whisky
and
coffins
in
buenos
aires
the
march
of
civilization
had
crushed
him
memory
only
clung
to
his
name
enterprising
man
that
he
was
i
fain
would
have
looked
him
up
i
remember
the
tiers
of
ranged
on
end
on
one
side
of
the
store
while
on
the
other
side
and
divided
by
a
thin
partition
were
the
coffins
in
the
same
order
of
all
sizes
and
in
great
numbers
the
unique
arrangement
seemed
in
order
for
as
a
cask
was
emptied
a
coffin
might
be
filled
besides
cheap
whisky
and
many
other
liquors
he
sold
cider
which
he
manufactured
from
damaged
malaga
raisins
within
the
scope
of
his
enterprise
was
also
the
sale
of
mineral
waters
not
entirely
blameless
of
the
germs
of
disease
this
man
surely
catered
to
all
the
tastes
wants
and
conditions
of
his
customers
farther
along
in
the
city
however
survived
the
good
man
who
wrote
on
the
side
of
his
store
where
thoughtful
men
might
read
and
learn
this
wicked
world
will
be
destroyed
by
a
comet
the
owner
of
this
store
is
therefore
bound
to
sell
out
at
any
price
and
avoid
the
catastrophe
my
friend
mulhall
drove
me
round
to
view
the
fearful
comet
with
streaming
tail
pictured
large
on
the
trembling
walls
i
unshipped
the
sloop
mast
at
buenos
aires
and
shortened
it
by
seven
feet
i
reduced
the
length
of
the
bowsprit
by
about
five
feet
and
even
then
i
found
it
reaching
far
enough
from
home
and
more
than
once
when
on
the
end
of
it
reefing
the
jib
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
shortened
it

was
glad
of
a
tow
from
a
harbor
tug
to
clear
the
port

but
a
gale
came
up
soon
after
and
caused
an
ugly
sea
and
instead
of
being
all
silver
as
before
the

was
now
all
mud
the

is
a
treacherous

one

should
always

could
find
near

was
tossed
miserably
all
night

on
the

i
got
the

with

worked

down

in

that
i
expected
all
fine
sailing
on
the

cape

direct
but
while
i
worked
at
the
sails
and
rigging
i
thought
only
of
onward
and
forward
it
was
when
i
anchored
in
the
lonely
places
that
a
feeling
of
awe
crept
over
me
at
the
last
anchorage
on
the
monotonous
and
muddy
river
weak
as
it
may
seem
i
gave
way
to
my
feelings
i
resolved
then
that
i
would
anchor
no
more

then
bore
away
for

farther
and
farther
toward
the
wonderland
of
the
south

i
forgot
the
blessings
of
our
milder
north
my
ship
passed
in
safety

also
the
gulf
of

and
the
mighty

of
george
hoping
that
she
might
go
clear
of
the
destructive
the
dread
of
big
craft
or
little
along
this
coast
i
gave
all
the
capes
a
berth
of
about
fifty
miles
for
these
dangers

many
miles
from
the
land
but
where
the
sloop
avoided
one
danger
she
encountered
another
for
one
day
well
off
the
patagonian
coast
while
the
sloop
was
reaching
under
short
sail
a
tremendous
wave
the
culmination
it
seemed
of
many
waves
rolled
down
upon
her
in
a
storm
roaring
as
it
came
i
had
only
a
moment
to
get
all
sail
down
and
myself
up
on
the
peak
halliards
out
of
danger
when
i
saw
the
mighty
crest
towering
above
me
the
mountain
of
water
submerged
my
vessel
she
shook
in
every
timber
and
reeled
under
the
weight
of
the
sea
but
rose
quickly
out
of
it
and
rode
grandly
over
the
rollers
that
followed
it
may
have
been
a
minute
that
from
my
hold
in
the
rigging
i
could
see
no
part
of
the
hull
perhaps
it
was
even
less
time
than
that
but
it
seemed
a
long
while
for
under
great
excitement
one
lives
fast
and
in
a
few
seconds
one
may
think
a
great
deal
of
one
past
life
not
only
did
the
past
with
electric
speed
flash
before
me
but
i
had
time
while
in
my
hazardous
position
for
resolutions
for
the
future
that
would
take
a
long
time
to
fulfil
the
first
one
was
i
remember
that
if
the
came
through
this
danger
i
would
dedicate
my
best
energies
to
building
a
larger
ship
on
her
lines
which
i
hope
yet
to
do
other
promises
less
easily
kept
i
should
have
made
under
protest
however
the
incident
which
filled
me
with
fear
was
only
one
more
test
of
the
seaworthiness
it
reassured
me
against
rude
cape
horn
from
the
time
the
great
wave
swept
over
the
until
she
reached
cape
virgins
nothing
occurred
to
move
a
pulse
and
set
blood
in
motion
on
the
contrary
the
weather
became
fine

the
sea
smooth

life
tranquil

phenomenon
of

occurred

albatross
sitting
on
the
water

day
loomed
up
like
a
large
ship

asleep
on

like
great
whales
and
a
bank
of
haze

could
have
sworn

kaleidescope

changed

to
the

rounded

and
entered

the
scene
was
again
real
and
gloomy
the
wind
northeast
and
blowing
a
gale
sent
spume
along
the
coast
such
a
sea
ran
as
would
swamp
an
ship
as
the
sloop
neared
the
entrance
to
the
strait
i
observed
that
two
great
made
ahead
one
very
close
to
the
point

the
land
and
one
farther
offshore
between
the
two

channel

the
with

a
rolling
sea
followed
her
a
long
way
in

a
fierce
current
swept
around
the
cape

her
but
this
she
stemmed
and
was
soon
chirruping
under
the
lee
of
cape
virgins
and
running
every
minute
into
smoother
water

long
trailing
kelp
from
sunken
rocks
waved
forebodingly
under
her
keel
and
the
wreck
of
a
great
steamship
smashed
on
the
beach
abreast
gave
a
gloomy
aspect
to
the
scene
i
was
not
to
be
let
off
easy
the
virgins
would
collect
tribute
even
from
the
passing
their
promontory

reefed
the

sitting
in
the
cabin

my
eyes

was
so
strongly
impressed
with
what
in
all
nature
i
might
expect
that
as
i
dozed
the
very
air
i
breathed
seemed
to
warn
me
of
danger
my
senses
heard
ahoy
shouted
in
warning
i
sprang
to
the
deck
wondering
who
could
be
there
that
knew
the
so
well
as
to
call
out
her
name
passing
in
the
dark
for
it
was
now
the
blackest
of
nights
all
around
except
away
in
the
southwest
where
the
old
familiar
white
arch
the
terror
of
cape
horn
rapidly
pushed
up
by
a
southwest
gale
i
had
only
a
moment
to
douse
sail
and
lash
all
solid
when
it
struck
like
a
shot
from
a
cannon
and
for
the
first
it
was
something
to
be
remembered
by
way
of
a
gale
for
thirty
hours
it
kept
on
blowing
hard
the
sloop
could
carry
no
more
than
a
mainsail
and
forestaysail
with
these
she
held
on
stoutly
and
was
not
blown
out
of
the
strait
in
the
height
of
the
squalls
in
this
gale
she
doused
all

this
occurred
often
enough

seemed
not

in

the

beastly
drunk
were
they
to
say
nothing

down

as
a
general
thing
to
my
mind
whenever
an
execution
was
made
they
killed
the
wrong
man
just
previous
to
my
arrival
the
governor
himself

wipe
out
what
they
could
of
it
on

of
the
recent
massacre
of
a

crew
somewhere
else
altogether
the
place
was
quite
newsy
and
supported
two
papers

i
think
the

chilean
naval
officer
advised
me
to
ship

fight

through
which
would
give
me
a
tow
after
canvassing
the
place
however
i
found
only
one
man
willing
to
embark
and
he
on
condition
that
i
should
ship
another
mon
and
a
doog
but
as
no
one
else
was
willing
to
come
along
and
as
i
drew
the
line
at
dogs
i
said
no
more
about
the
matter
but
simply
loaded
my
guns
at
this
point
in
my
dilemma
captain
pedro
samblich
a
good
austrian
of
large
experience
coming
along
gave
me
a
bag
of
worth
more
than
all
the
fighting
men
and
dogs
of
tierra
del
fuego
i
protested
that
i
had
no
use
for
on
board
samblich
smiled
at
my
want
of
experience
and
maintained
stoutly
that
i
would
have
use
for
them
you
must
use
them
with
discretion
he
said
that
is
to
say
do
step
on
them
yourself
with
this
remote
hint
about
the
use
of
the
tacks
i
got
on
all
right
and
saw
the
way
to
maintain
clear
decks
at
night
without
the
care
of
watching
illustration
the
man
who
would
ship
without
another
mon
and
a
doog
samblich
was
greatly
interested
in
my
voyage
and
after
giving
me
the
tacks
he
put
on
board
bags
of
biscuits
and
a
large
quantity
of
smoked
venison
he
declared
that
my
bread
which
was
ordinary
and
easily
broken
was
not
nutritious
as
his
which
was
so
hard
that
i
could
break
it
only
with
a
stout
blow
from
a
maul
then
he
gave
me
from
his
own
sloop
a
compass
which
was
certainly
better
than
mine
and
offered
to
unbend
her
mainsail
for
me
if
i
would
accept
it
last
of
all
this
man
brought
out
a
bottle
of
fuegian
from
a
place
where
it
had
been
and
begged
me
to
help
myself
from
it
for
use
farther
along
on
the
voyage
but
i
felt
sure
of
success
without
this
draft
on
a
friend
and
i
was
right
tacks
as
it
turned
out
were
of
more
value
than
gold
illustration
a
fuegian
girl
the
port
captain
finding
that
i
was
resolved
to
go
even
alone
since
there
was
no
help
for
it
set
up
no
further
objections
but
advised
me
in
case
the
savages
tried
to
surround
me
with
their
canoes
to
shoot
straight
and
begin
to
do
it
in
time
but
to
avoid
killing
them
if
possible
which
i
heartily
agreed
to
do
with
these
simple
injunctions
the
officer
gave
me
my
port
clearance
free
of
charge
and
i
sailed
on
the
same
day
february
it
was
not
without
thoughts
of
strange
and
stirring
adventure
beyond
all
i
had
yet
encountered
that
i
now
sailed
into
the
country
and
very
core
of
the
savage
fuegians
a
fair
wind
from
sandy
point
brought
me
on
the
first
day
to
nicholas
bay
where
so
i
was
told
i
might
expect
to
meet
savages
but
seeing
no
signs
of
life
i
came
to
anchor
in
eight
fathoms
of
water
where
i
lay
all
night
under
a
high
mountain
here
i
had
my
first
experience
with
the
terrific
squalls
called
williwaws
which
extended
from
this
point
on
through
the
strait
to
the
pacific
they
were
compressed
gales
of
wind
that
boreas
handed
down
over
the
hills
in
chunks
a
williwaw
will
throw
a
ship
even
without
sail
on
over
on
her
beam
ends
but
like
other
gales
they
cease
now
and
then
if
only
for
a
short
time
february
was
my
birthday
and
i
found
myself
alone
with
hardly
so
much
as
a
bird
in
sight
off
cape
froward
the
southernmost
point
of
the
continent
of
america
by
daylight
in
the
morning
i
was
getting
my
ship
under
way
for
the
bout
ahead
the
sloop
held
the
wind
fair
while
she
ran
thirty
miles
farther
on
her
course
which
brought
her
to
fortescue
bay
and
at
once
among
the
natives
which
blazed
up
now
on
all
sides
clouds
flew
over
the
mountain
from
the
west
all
day
at
night
my
good
east
wind
failed
and
in
its
stead
a
gale
from
the
west
soon
came
on
i
gained
anchorage
at
twelve
that
night
under
the
lee
of
a
little
island
and
then
prepared
myself
a
cup
of
coffee
of
which
i
was
sorely
in
need
for
to
tell
the
truth
hard
beating
in
the
heavy
squalls
and
against
the
current
had
told
on
my
strength
finding
that
the
anchor
held
i
drank
my
beverage
and
named
the
place
coffee
island
it
lies
to
the
south
of
charles
island
with
only
a
narrow
channel
between
illustration
looking
west
from
fortescue
bay
where
the
was
chased
by
indians
from
a
photograph
by
daylight
the
next
morning
the
was
again
under
way
beating
hard
but
she
came
to
in
a
cove
in
charles
island
two
and
a
half
miles
along
on
her
course
here
she
remained
undisturbed
two
days
with
both
anchors
down
in
a
bed
of
kelp
indeed
she
might
have
remained
undisturbed
indefinitely
had
not
the
wind
moderated
for
during
these
two
days
it
blew
so
hard
that
no
boat
could
venture
out
on
the
strait
and
the
natives
being
away
to
other
the
island
anchorage
was
safe
but
at
the
end
of
the
fierce
fair
weather
came
then
i
got
my
anchors
and
again
sailed
out
upon
the
strait
canoes
manned
by
savages
from
fortescue
now
came
in
pursuit
the
wind
falling
light
they
gained
on
me
rapidly
till
coming
within
hail
when
they
ceased
paddling
and
a
savage
stood
up
and
called
to
me
yammerschooner
yammerschooner
which
is
their
begging
term
i
said
no
now
i
was
not
for
letting
on
that
i
was
alone
and
so
i
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
passing
through
the
hold
came
out
at
the
changing
my
clothes
as
i
went
along
that
made
two
men
then
the
piece
of
bowsprit
which
i
had
sawed
off
at
buenos
aires
and
which
i
had
still
on
board
i
arranged
forward
on
the
lookout
dressed
as
a
seaman
attaching
a
line
by
which
i
could
pull
it
into
motion
that
made
three
of
us
and
we
did
want
to
yammerschooner
but
for
all
that
the
savages
came
on
faster
than
before
i
saw
that
besides
four
at
the
paddles
in
the
canoe
nearest
to
me
there
were
others
in
the
bottom
and
that
they
were
shifting
hands
often
at
eighty
yards
i
fired
a
shot
across
the
bows
of
the
nearest
canoe
at
which
they
all
stopped
but
only
for
a
moment
seeing
that
they
persisted
in
coming
nearer
i
fired
the
second
shot
so
close
to
the
chap
who
wanted
to
yammerschooner
that
he
changed
his
mind
quickly
enough
and
bellowed
with
fear
bueno
jo
via
isla
and
sitting
down
in
his
canoe
he
rubbed
his
starboard
for
some
time
i
was
thinking
of
the
good
port
captain
advice
when
i
pulled
the
trigger
and
must
have
aimed
pretty
straight
however
a
miss
was
as
good
as
a
mile
for
black
pedro
as
he
it
was
and
no
other
a
leader
in
several
bloody
massacres
he
made
for
the
island
now
and
the
others
followed
him
i
knew
by
his
spanish
lingo
and
by
his
full
beard
that
he
was
the
villain
i
have
named
a
renegade
mongrel
and
the
worst
murderer
in
tierra
del
fuego
the
authorities
had
been
in
search
of
him
for
two
years
the
fuegians
are
not
bearded
so
much
for
the
first
day
among
the
savages
i
came
to
anchor
at
midnight
in
three
island
cove
about
twenty
miles
along
from
fortescue
bay
i
saw
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
strait
and
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
but
where
i
lay
it
was
quite
deserted
by
natives
i
have
always
taken
it
as
a
sign
that
where
i
found
birds
sitting
about
or
seals
on
the
rocks
i
should
not
find
savage
indians
seals
are
never
plentiful
in
these
waters
but
in
three
island
cove
i
saw
one
on
the
rocks
and
other
signs
of
the
absence
of
savage
men
illustration
a
brush
with
fuegians
on
the
next
day
the
wind
was
again
blowing
a
gale
and
although
she
was
in
the
lee
of
the
land
the
sloop
dragged
her
anchors
so
that
i
had
to
get
her
under
way
and
beat
farther
into
the
cove
where
i
came
to
in
a
landlocked
pool
at
another
time
or
place
this
would
have
been
a
rash
thing
to
do
and
it
was
safe
now
only
from
the
fact
that
the
gale
which
drove
me
to
shelter
would
keep
the
indians
from
crossing
the
strait
seeing
this
was
the
case
i
went
ashore
with
gun
and
ax
on
an
island
where
i
could
not
in
any
event
be
surprised
and
there
felled
trees
and
split
about
a
cord
of
which
loaded
my
small
boat
several
times
while
i
carried
the
wood
though
i
was
morally
sure
there
were
no
savages
near
i
never
once
went
to
or
from
the
skiff
without
my
gun
while
i
had
that
and
a
clear
field
of
over
eighty
yards
about
me
i
felt
safe
the
trees
on
the
island
very
scattering
were
a
sort
of
beech
and
a
stunted
cedar
both
of
which
made
good
fuel
even
the
green
limbs
of
the
beech
which
seemed
to
possess
a
resinous
quality
burned
readily
in
my
great
i
have
described
my
method
of
wooding
up
in
detail
that
the
reader
who
has
kindly
borne
with
me
so
far
may
see
that
in
this
as
in
all
other
particulars
of
my
voyage
i
took
great
care
against
all
kinds
of
surprises
whether
by
animals
or
by
the
elements
in
the
strait
of
magellan
the
greatest
vigilance
was
necessary
in
this
instance
i
reasoned
that
i
had
all
about
me
the
greatest
danger
of
the
whole
voyage
the
treachery
of
cunning
savages
for
which
i
must
be
particularly
on
the
alert
the
sailed
from
three
island
cove
in
the
morning
after
the
gale
went
down
but
was
glad
to
return
for
shelter
from
another
sudden
gale
sailing
again
on
the
following
day
she
fetched
borgia
bay
a
few
miles
on
her
course
where
vessels
had
anchored
from
time
to
time
and
had
nailed
boards
on
the
trees
ashore
with
name
and
date
of
harboring
carved
or
painted
nothing
else
could
i
see
to
indicate
that
civilized
man
had
ever
been
there
i
had
taken
a
survey
of
the
gloomy
place
with
my
and
was
getting
my
boat
out
to
land
and
take
notes
when
the
chilean
gunboat
came
in
and
officers
coming
on
board
advised
me
to
leave
the
place
at
once
a
thing
that
required
little
eloquence
to
persuade
me
to
do
i
accepted
the
captain
kind
offer
of
a
tow
to
the
next
anchorage
at
the
place
called
notch
cove
eight
miles
farther
along
where
i
should
be
clear
of
the
worst
of
the
fuegians
illustration
a
bit
of
friendly
assistance
after
a
sketch
by
midshipman
miguel
arenas
we
made
anchorage
at
the
cove
about
dark
that
night
while
the
wind
came
down
in
fierce
williwaws
from
the
mountains
an
instance
of
magellan
weather
was
afforded
when
the
a
gunboat
of
great
power
after
attempting
on
the
following
day
to
proceed
on
her
voyage
was
obliged
by
sheer
force
of
the
wind
to
return
and
take
up
anchorage
again
and
remain
till
the
gale
abated
and
lucky
she
was
to
get
back
meeting
this
vessel
was
a
little
godsend
she
was
commanded
and
officered
by
sailors
and
educated
gentlemen
an
entertainment
that
was
gotten
up
on
her
impromptu
at
the
notch
would
be
hard
to
beat
anywhere
one
of
her
midshipmen
sang
popular
songs
in
french
german
and
spanish
and
one
so
he
said
in
russian
if
the
audience
did
not
know
the
lingo
of
one
song
from
another
it
was
no
drawback
to
the
merriment
i
was
left
alone
the
next
day
for
then
the
put
out
on
her
voyage
the
gale
having
abated
i
spent
a
day
taking
in
wood
and
water
by
the
end
of
that
time
the
weather
was
fine
then
i
sailed
from
the
desolate
place
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
concerning
the
first
passage
through
the
strait
that
would
differ
from
what
i
have
already
recorded
she
anchored
and
weighed
many
times
and
beat
many
days
against
the
current
with
now
and
then
a
slant
for
a
few
miles
till
finally
she
gained
anchorage
and
shelter
for
the
night
at
port
tamar
with
cape
pillar
in
sight
to
the
west
here
i
felt
the
throb
of
the
great
ocean
that
lay
before
me
i
knew
now
that
i
had
put
a
world
behind
me
and
that
i
was
opening
out
another
world
ahead
i
had
passed
the
haunts
of
savages
great
piles
of
granite
mountains
of
bleak
and
lifeless
aspect
were
now
astern
on
some
of
them
not
even
a
speck
of
moss
had
ever
grown
there
was
an
unfinished
newness
all
about
the
land
on
the
hill
back
of
port
tamar
a
small
beacon
had
been
thrown
up
showing
that
some
man
had
been
there
but
how
could
one
tell
but
that
he
had
died
of
loneliness
and
grief
in
a
bleak
land
is
not
the
place
to
enjoy
solitude
throughout
the
whole
of
the
strait
west
of
cape
froward
i
saw
no
animals
except
dogs
owned
by
savages
these
i
saw
often
enough
and
heard
them
yelping
night
and
day
birds
were
not
plentiful
the
scream
of
a
wild
fowl
which
i
took
for
a
loon
sometimes
startled
me
with
its
piercing
cry
the
steamboat
duck
so
called
because
it
propels
itself
over
the
sea
with
its
wings
and
resembles
a
miniature
steamer
in
its
motion
was
sometimes
seen
scurrying
on
out
of
danger
it
never
flies
but
hitting
the
water
instead
of
the
air
with
its
wings
it
moves
faster
than
a
rowboat
or
a
canoe
the
few
i
saw
were
very
shy
and
of
fishes
i
saw
next
to
none
at
all
i
did
not
catch
one
indeed
i
seldom
or
never
put
a
hook
over
during
the
whole
voyage
here
in
the
strait
i
found
great
abundance
of
mussels
of
an
excellent
quality
i
fared
sumptuously
on
them
there
was
a
sort
of
swan
smaller
than
a
muscovy
duck
which
might
have
been
brought
down
with
the
gun
but
in
the
loneliness
of
life
about
the
dreary
country
i
found
myself
in
no
mood
to
make
one
life
less

of

the
sailed
from

direct
for

with
the
wind
from
the
northeast
which
i
fervently
hoped
might
hold
till
she
cleared

but
there
was
no

in

it
soon
began
to

boding
no

nothing

plunged
into

there
was
no
turning
back

had
i
wished
to
do
so
for
the
land
was
now
shut
out
by
the
darkness

the

freshened
and
i
took
in
a
third

the
sea
was
confused
and
treacherous
in
such
a
time
as
this
the
old
fisherman
prayed
remember
lord
my
ship
is
small
and
thy
sea
is
so
wide
i
saw
now
only
the
gleaming
crests
of
the
waves
they
showed
white
teeth
while
the
sloop
balanced
over
them
everything
for
an
offing
i
cried
and
to
this
end
i
carried
on
all
the
sail
she
would
bear
she
ran
all
night
with
a
free
sheet
but
on
the
morning
of

the
wind
shifted
to

back
suddenly
to

blew
with
terrific
force
the
stripped
of

sails
then
bore
off
under
bare
poles
no
ship
in
the
world
could
have
stood
up
against

violent

that

might
continue
for
many
days
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
work
back
to
the
westward
along
the
coast
outside
of
tierra
del
fuego
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
on
and
go
east
about
after
all
anyhow
for
my
present
safety
the
only
course
lay
in
keeping
her
before
the
wind
and
so
she
drove
southeast
as
though
about
to
round
the
horn
while
the
waves
rose
and
fell
and
bellowed
their
story
of
the
sea
but
the
hand
that
held
these
held
also
the
she
was
running
now
with
a
reefed
forestaysail
the
sheets
flat
amidship
i
paid
out
two
long
ropes
to
steady
her
course
and
to
break
combing
seas
astern
and
i
lashed
the
helm
amidship
in
this
trim
she
ran
before
it
shipping
never
a
sea
even
while
the
storm
raged
at
its
worst
my
ship
was
wholesome
and
noble
my
mind
as
to
her
seaworthiness
was
put
at
ease
for
aye
illustration
cape
pillar
when
all
had
been
done
that
i
could
do
for
the
safety
of
the
vessel
i
got
to
the
between
seas
and
prepared
a
pot
of
coffee
over
a
wood
fire
and
made
a
good
irish
stew
then
as
before
and
afterward
on
the
i
insisted
on
warm
meals
in
the
off
cape
pillar
however
where
the
sea
was
marvelously
high
uneven
and
crooked
my
appetite
was
slim
and
for
a
time
i
postponed
cooking
confidentially
i
was
seasick
the
first
day
of
the
storm
gave
the
her
actual
test
in
the
worst
sea
that
cape
horn
or
its
wild
regions
could
afford
and
in
no
part
of
the
world
could
a
rougher
sea
be
found
than
at
this
particular
point
namely
off
cape
pillar
the
grim
sentinel
of
the
horn
farther
offshore
while
the
sea
was
majestic
there
was
less
apprehension
of
danger
there
the
rode
now
like
a
bird
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
and
now
like
a
waif
deep
down
in
the
hollow
between
seas
and
so
she
drove
on
whole
days
passed
counted
as
other
days
but
with
always
a
thrill
yes
of
delight
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
gale
rapidly
nearing
the
pitch
of
cape
horn
i
inspected
my
chart
and
pricked
off
the
course
and
distance
to
port
stanley
in
the
falkland
islands
where
i
might
find
my
way
and
refit
when
i
saw
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
a
high
mountain
about
seven
leagues
away
on
the
port
beam
the
fierce
edge
of
the
gale
by
this
time
had
blown
off
and
i
had
already
bent
a
on
the
boom
in
place
of
the
mainsail
which
was
torn
to
rags
i
hauled
in
the
trailing
ropes
hoisted
this
awkward
sail
reefed
the
forestaysail
being
already
set
and
under
this
sail
brought
her
at
once
on
the
wind
heading
for
the
land
which
appeared
as
an
island
in
the
sea
so
it
turned
out
to
be
though
not
the
one
i
had
supposed
i
was
exultant
over
the
prospect
of
once
more
entering
the
strait
of
magellan
and
beating
through
again
into
the
pacific
for
it
was
more
than
rough
on
the
outside
coast
of
tierra
del
fuego
it
was
indeed
a
mountainous
sea
when
the
sloop
was
in
the
fiercest
squalls
with
only
the
reefed
forestaysail
set
even
that
small
sail
shook
her
from
keelson
to
truck
when
it
shivered
by
the
leech
had
i
harbored
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
for
her
safety
it
would
have
been
that
she
might
spring
a
leak
in
the
garboard
at
the
heel
of
the
mast
but
she
never
called
me
once
to
the
pump
under
pressure
of
the
smallest
sail
i
could
set
she
made
for
the
land
like
a
and
steering
her
over
the
crests
of
the
waves
so
that
she
might
not
trip
was
nice
work
i
stood
at
the
helm
now
and
made
the
most
of
it
night
closed
in
before
the
sloop
reached
the
land
leaving
her
feeling
the
way
in
pitchy
darkness
i
saw
breakers
ahead
before
long
at
this
i
wore
ship
and
stood
offshore
but
was
immediately
startled
by
the
tremendous
roaring
of
breakers
again
ahead
and
on
the
lee
bow
this
puzzled
me
for
there
should
have
been
no
broken
water
where
i
supposed
myself
to
be
i
kept
off
a
good
bit
then
wore
round
but
finding
broken
water
also
there
threw
her
head
again
offshore
in
this
way
among
dangers
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
hail
and
sleet
in
the
fierce
squalls
cut
my
flesh
till
the
blood
trickled
over
my
face
but
what
of
that
it
was
daylight
and
the
sloop
was
in
the
midst
of
the
milky
way
of
the
sea
which
is
northwest
of
cape
horn
and
it
was
the
white
breakers
of
a
huge
sea
over
sunken
rocks
which
had
threatened
to
engulf
her
through
the
night
it
was
fury
island
i
had
sighted
and
steered
for
and
what
a
panorama
was
before
me
now
and
all
around
it
was
not
the
time
to
complain
of
a
broken
skin
what
could
i
do
but
fill
away
among
the
breakers
and
find
a
channel
between
them
now
that
it
was
day
since
she
had
escaped
the
rocks
through
the
night
surely
she
would
find
her
way
by
daylight
this
was
the
greatest
sea
adventure
of
my
life
god
knows
how
my
vessel
escaped
the
sloop
at
last
reached
inside
of
small
islands
that
sheltered
her
in
smooth
water
then
i
climbed
the
mast
to
survey
the
wild
scene
astern
the
great
naturalist
darwin
looked
over
this
seascape
from
the
deck
of
the
and
wrote
in
his
journal
any
landsman
seeing
the
milky
way
would
have
nightmare
for
a
week
he
might
have
added
or
seaman
as
well
the
good
luck
followed
fast
i
discovered
as
she
sailed
along
through
a
labyrinth
of
islands
that
she
was
in
the
cockburn
channel
which
leads
into
the
strait
of
magellan
at
a
point
opposite
cape
froward
and
that
she
was
already
passing
thieves
bay
suggestively
named
and
at
night
march
behold
she
was
at
anchor
in
a
snug
cove
at
the
turn
every
on
the
now
counted
thanks
here
i
pondered
on
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
and
strangely
enough
instead
of
feeling
rested
from
sitting
or
lying
down
i
now
began
to
feel
jaded
and
worn
but
a
hot
meal
of
venison
stew
soon
put
me
right
so
that
i
could
sleep
as
drowsiness
came
on
i
sprinkled
the
deck
with
tacks
and
then
i
turned
in
bearing
in
mind
the
advice
of
my
old
friend
samblich
that
i
was
not
to
step
on
them
myself
i
saw
to
it
that
not
a
few
of
them
stood
business
end
up
for
when
the
passed
thieves
bay
two
canoes
had
put
out
and
followed
in
her
wake
and
there
was
no
disguising
the
fact
any
longer
that
i
was
alone
now
it
is
well
known
that
one
can
not
step
on
a
tack
without
saying
something
about
it
a
pretty
good
christian
will
whistle
when
he
steps
on
the
commercial
end
of
a
a
savage
will
howl
and
claw
the
air
and
that
was
just
what
happened
that
night
about
twelve
while
i
was
asleep
in
the
cabin
where
the
savages
thought
they
had
me
sloop
and
all
but
changed
their
minds
when
they
stepped
on
deck
for
then
they
thought
that
i
or
somebody
else
had
them
i
had
no
need
of
a
dog
they
howled
like
a
pack
of
hounds
i
had
hardly
use
for
a
gun
they
jumped
some
into
their
canoes
and
some
into
the
sea
to
cool
off
i
suppose
and
there
was
a
deal
of
free
language
over
it
as
they
went
i
fired
several
guns
when
i
came
on
deck
to
let
the
rascals
know
that
i
was
home
and
then
i
turned
in
again
feeling
sure
i
should
not
be
disturbed
any
more
by
people
who
left
in
so
great
a
hurry
the
fuegians
being
cruel
are
naturally
cowards
they
regard
a
rifle
with
superstitious
fear
the
only
real
danger
one
could
see
that
might
come
from
their
quarter
would
be
from
allowing
them
to
surround
one
within
or
to
anchor
within
range
where
they
might
lie
in
ambush
as
for
their
coming
on
deck
at
night
even
had
i
not
put
tacks
about
i
could
have
cleared
them
off
by
shots
from
the
cabin
and
hold
i
always
kept
a
quantity
of
ammunition
within
reach
in
the
hold
and
in
the
cabin
and
in
the
forepeak
so
that
retreating
to
any
of
these
places
i
could
hold
the
fort
simply
by
shooting
up
through
the
deck
illustration
they
howled
like
a
pack
of
hounds
perhaps
the
greatest
danger
to
be
apprehended
was
from
the
use
of
fire
every
canoe
carries
fire
nothing
is
thought
of
that
for
it
is
their
custom
to
communicate
by
the
harmless
brand
that
lies
smoldering
in
the
bottom
of
one
of
their
canoes
might
be
ablaze
in
one
cabin
if
he
were
not
on
the
alert
the
port
captain
of
sandy
point
warned
me
particularly
of
this
danger
only
a
short
time
before
they
had
fired
a
chilean
gunboat
by
throwing
brands
in
through
the
stern
windows
of
the
cabin
the
had
no
openings
in
the
cabin
or
deck
except
two
scuttles
and
these
were
guarded
by
fastenings
which
could
not
be
undone
without
waking
me
if
i
were
asleep
on
the
morning
of
the
after
a
refreshing
rest
and
a
warm
breakfast
and
after
i
had
swept
the
deck
of
tacks
i
got
out
what
spare
canvas
there
was
on
board
and
began
to
sew
the
pieces
together
in
the
shape
of
a
peak
for
my
the
tarpaulin
the
day
to
all
appearances
promised
fine
weather
and
light
winds
but
appearances
in
tierra
del
fuego
do
not
always
count
while
i
was
wondering
why
no
trees
grew
on
the
slope
abreast
of
the
anchorage
half
minded
to
lay
by
the
and
land
with
my
gun
for
some
game
and
to
inspect
a
white
boulder
on
the
beach
near
the
brook
a
williwaw
came
down
with
such
terrific
force
as
to
carry
the
with
two
anchors
down
like
a
feather
out
of
the
cove
and
away
into
deep
water
no
wonder
trees
did
not
grow
on
the
side
of
that
hill
great
boreas
a
tree
would
need
to
be
all
roots
to
hold
on
against
such
a
furious
wind
from
the
cove
to
the
nearest
land
to
leeward
was
a
long
drift
however
and
i
had
ample
time
to
weigh
both
anchors
before
the
sloop
came
near
any
danger
and
so
no
harm
came
of
it
i
saw
no
more
savages
that
day
or
the
next
they
probably
had
some
sign
by
which
they
knew
of
the
coming
williwaws
at
least
they
were
wise
in
not
being
afloat
even
on
the
second
day
for
i
had
no
sooner
gotten
to
work
at
again
after
the
anchor
was
down
than
the
wind
as
on
the
day
before
picked
the
sloop
up
and
flung
her
seaward
with
a
vengeance
anchor
and
all
as
before
this
fierce
wind
usual
to
the
magellan
country
continued
on
through
the
day
and
swept
the
sloop
by
several
miles
of
steep
bluffs
and
precipices
overhanging
a
bold
shore
of
wild
and
uninviting
appearance
i
was
not
sorry
to
get
away
from
it
though
in
doing
so
it
was
no
elysian
shore
to
which
i
shaped
my
course
i
kept
on
sailing
in
hope
since
i
had
no
choice
but
to
go
on
heading
across
for
nicholas
bay
where
i
had
cast
anchor
february
it
was
now
the
of
march
upon
reaching
the
bay
the
second
time
i
had
circumnavigated
the
wildest
part
of
desolate
tierra
del
fuego
but
the
had
not
yet
arrived
at
nicholas
and
by
the
merest
accident
her
bones
were
saved
from
resting
there
when
she
did
arrive
the
parting
of
a
in
a
williwaw
when
the
sea
was
turbulent
and
she
was
plunging
into
the
storm
brought
me
forward
to
see
instantly
a
dark
cliff
ahead
and
breakers
so
close
under
the
bows
that
i
felt
surely
lost
and
in
my
thoughts
cried
is
the
hand
of
fate
against
me
after
all
leading
me
in
the
end
to
this
dark
spot
i
sprang
aft
again
unheeding
the
flapping
sail
and
threw
the
wheel
over
expecting
as
the
sloop
came
down
into
the
hollow
of
a
wave
to
feel
her
timbers
smash
under
me
on
the
rocks
but
at
the
touch
of
her
helm
she
swung
clear
of
the
danger
and
in
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
lee
of
the
land
illustration
a
glimpse
of
sandy
point
punta
arenas
in
the
strait
of
magellan
it
was
the
small
island
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
for
which
the
sloop
had
been
steering
and
which
she
made
with
such
unerring
aim
as
nearly
to
run
it
down
farther
along
in
the
bay
was
the
anchorage
which
i
managed
to
reach
but
before
i
could
get
the
anchor
down
another
squall
caught
the
sloop
and
whirled
her
round
like
a
top
and
carried
her
away
altogether
to
leeward
of
the
bay
still
farther
to
leeward
was
a
great
headland
and
i
bore
off
for
that
this
was
retracing
my
course
toward
sandy
point
for
the
gale
was
from
the
southwest
i
had
the
sloop
soon
under
good
control
however
and
in
a
short
time
rounded
to
under
the
lee
of
a
mountain
where
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
a
and
the
sails
flapped
and
hung
limp
while
she
carried
her
way
close
in
here
i
thought
i
would
anchor
and
rest
till
morning
the
depth
being
eight
fathoms
very
close
to
the
shore
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
as
i
let
go
the
anchor
that
it
did
not
reach
the
bottom
before
another
williwaw
struck
down
from
this
mountain
and
carried
the
sloop
off
faster
than
i
could
pay
out
cable
therefore
instead
of
resting
i
had
to
man
the
windlass
and
heave
up
the
anchor
with
fifty
fathoms
of
cable
hanging
up
and
down
in
deep
water
this
was
in
that
part
of
the
strait
called
famine
reach
dismal
famine
reach
on
the
sloop
i
worked
the
rest
of
the
night
thinking
how
much
easier
it
was
for
me
when
i
could
say
do
that
thing
or
the
other
than
now
doing
all
myself
but
i
hove
away
and
sang
the
old
chants
that
i
sang
when
i
was
a
sailor
within
the
last
few
days
i
had
passed
through
much
and
was
now
thankful
that
my
state
was
no
worse
it
was
daybreak
when
the
anchor
was
at
the
hawse
by
this
time
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
took
the
place
of
williwaws
while
the
sloop
drifted
slowly
toward
sandy
point
she
came
within
sight
of
ships
at
anchor
in
the
roads
and
i
was
more
than
half
minded
to
put
in
for
new
sails
but
the
wind
coming
out
from
the
northeast
which
was
fair
for
the
other
direction
i
turned
the
prow
of
the
westward
once
more
for
the
pacific
to
traverse
a
second
time
the
second
half

boom
expanded
to
the
dimensions
of
a
serviceable
mainsail
with
a
peak
to
it
and
a
leech
besides
if
it
was
not
the
sail
afloat
it
was
at
least
very
strongly
made
and
would
stand
a
hard
blow
a
ship
meeting
the
long
afterward
reported
her
as
wearing
a
mainsail
of
some
improved
design
and
patent
reefer
but
that
was
not
the
case
the
for
a
few
days
after
the
storm
enjoyed
fine
weather
and
made
fair
time
through
the
strait
for
the
distance
of
twenty
miles
which
in
these
days
of
many
adversities
i
called
a
long
run
the
weather
i
say
was
fine
for
a
few
days
but
it
brought
little
rest
care
for
the
safety
of
my
vessel
and
even
for
my
own
life
was
in
no
wise
lessened
by
the
absence
of
heavy
weather
indeed
the
peril
was
even
greater
inasmuch
as
the
savages
on
comparatively
fine
days
ventured
forth
on
their
marauding
excursions
and
in
boisterous
weather
disappeared
from
sight
their
wretched
canoes
being
frail
and
undeserving
the
name
of
craft
at
all
this
being
so
i
now
enjoyed
gales
of
wind
as
never
before
and
the
was
never
long
without
them
during
her
struggles
about
cape
horn
i
became
in
a
measure
inured
to
the
life
and
began
to
think
that
one
more
trip
through
the
strait
if
perchance
the
sloop
should
be
blown
off
again
would
make
me
the
aggressor
and
put
the
fuegians
entirely
on
the
defensive
this
feeling
was
forcibly
borne
in
on
me
at
snug
bay
where
i
anchored
at
gray
morning
after
passing
cape
froward
to
find
when
broad
day
appeared
that
two
canoes
which
i
had
eluded
by
sailing
all
night
were
now
entering
the
same
bay
stealthily
under
the
shadow
of
the
high
headland
they
were
well
manned
and
the
savages
were
well
armed
with
spears
and
bows
at
a
shot
from
my
rifle
across
the
bows
both
turned
aside
into
a
small
creek
out
of
range
in
danger
now
of
being
flanked
by
the
savages
in
the
bush
close
aboard
i
was
obliged
to
hoist
the
sails
which
i
had
barely
lowered
and
make
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
strait
a
distance
of
six
miles
but
now
i
was
put
to
my
wit
end
as
to
how
i
should
weigh
anchor
for
through
an
accident
to
the
windlass
right
here
i
could
not
budge
it
however
i
set
all
sail
and
filled
away
first
hauling
short
by
hand
the
sloop
carried
her
anchor
away
as
though
it
was
meant
to
be
always
towed
in
this
way
underfoot
and
with
it
she
towed
a
ton
or
more
of
kelp
from
a
reef
in
the
bay
the
wind
blowing
a
wholesale
breeze
meanwhile
i
worked
till
blood
started
from
my
fingers
and
with
one
eye
over
my
shoulder
for
savages
i
watched
at
the
same
time
and
sent
a
bullet
whistling
whenever
i
saw
a
limb
or
a
twig
move
for
i
kept
a
gun
always
at
hand
and
an
indian
appearing
then
within
range
would
have
been
taken
as
a
declaration
of
war
as
it
was
however
my
own
blood
was
all
that
was
spilt
and
from
the
trifling
accident
of
sometimes
breaking
the
flesh
against
a
cleat
or
a
pin
which
came
in
the
way
when
i
was
in
haste
in
my
hands
from
pulling
on
hard
wet
ropes
were
sometimes
painful
and
often
bled
freely
but
these
healed
when
i
finally
got
away
from
the
strait
into
fine
weather
after
clearing
snug
bay
i
hauled
the
sloop
to
the
wind
repaired
the
windlass
and
hove
the
anchor
to
the
hawse
catted
it
and
then
stretched
across
to
a
port
of
refuge
under
a
high
mountain
about
six
miles
away
and
came
to
in
nine
fathoms
close
under
the
face
of
a
perpendicular
cliff
here
my
own
voice
answered
back
and
i
named
the
place
echo
mountain
seeing
dead
trees
farther
along
where
the
shore
was
broken
i
made
a
landing
for
fuel
taking
besides
my
ax
a
rifle
which
on
these
days
i
never
left
far
from
hand
but
i
saw
no
living
thing
here
except
a
small
spider
which
had
nested
in
a
dry
log
that
i
boated
to
the
sloop
the
conduct
of
this
insect
interested
me
now
more
than
anything
else
around
the
wild
place
in
my
cabin
it
met
oddly
enough
a
spider
of
its
own
size
and
species
that
had
come
all
the
way
from
boston
a
very
civil
little
chap
too
but
mighty
spry
well
the
fuegian
threw
up
its
antennae
for
a
fight
but
my
little
bostonian
downed
it
at
once
then
broke
its
legs
and
pulled
them
off
one
by
one
so
dexterously
that
in
less
than
three
minutes
from
the
time
the
battle
began
the
fuegian
spider
did
know
itself
from
a
fly
i
made
haste
the
following
morning
to
be
under
way
after
a
night
of
wakefulness
on
the
weird
shore
before
weighing
anchor
however
i
prepared
a
cup
of
warm
coffee
over
a
smart
wood
fire
in
my
great
montevideo
stove
in
the
same
fire
was
cremated
the
fuegian
spider
slain
the
day
before
by
the
little
warrior
from
boston
which
a
scots
lady
at
cape
town
long
after
named
bruce
upon
hearing
of
its
prowess
at
echo
mountain
the
now
reached
away
for
coffee
island
which
i
sighted
on
my
birthday
february
illustration
yammerschooner
there
she
encountered
another
gale
that
brought
her
in
the
lee
of
great
charles
island
for
shelter
on
a
bluff
point
on
charles
were
and
a
tribe
of
savages
mustered
here
since
my
first
trip
through
the
strait
manned
their
canoes
to
put
off
for
the
sloop
it
was
not
prudent
to
come
to
the
anchorage
being
within
of
the
shore
which
was
thickly
wooded
but
i
made
signs
that
one
canoe
might
come
alongside
while
the
sloop
ranged
about
under
sail
in
the
lee
of
the
land
the
others
i
motioned
to
keep
off
and
incidentally
laid
a
smart
rifle
in
sight
close
at
hand
on
the
top
of
the
cabin
in
the
canoe
that
came
alongside
crying
their
begging
word
yammerschooner
were
two
squaws
and
one
indian
the
hardest
specimens
of
humanity
i
had
ever
seen
in
any
of
my
travels
yammerschooner
was
their
plaint
when
they
pushed
off
from
the
shore
and
yammerschooner
it
was
when
they
got
alongside
the
squaws
beckoned
for
food
while
the
indian
a
savage
stood
sulkily
as
if
he
took
no
interest
at
all
in
the
matter
but
on
my
turning
my
back
for
some
biscuits
and
jerked
beef
for
the
squaws
the
buck
sprang
on
deck
and
confronted
me
saying
in
spanish
jargon
that
we
had
met
before
i
thought
i
recognized
the
tone
of
his
yammerschooner
and
his
full
beard
identified
him
as
the
black
pedro
whom
it
was
true
i
had
met
before
where
are
the
rest
of
the
crew
he
asked
as
he
looked
uneasily
around
expecting
hands
maybe
to
come
out
of
the
and
deal
him
his
just
deserts
for
many
murders
about
three
weeks
ago
said
he
when
you
passed
up
here
i
saw
three
men
on
board
where
are
the
other
two
i
answered
him
briefly
that
the
same
crew
was
still
on
board
but
said
he
i
see
you
are
doing
all
the
work
and
with
a
leer
he
added
as
he
glanced
at
the
mainsail
hombre
valiente
i
explained
that
i
did
all
the
work
in
the
day
while
the
rest
of
the
crew
slept
so
that
they
would
be
fresh
to
watch
for
indians
at
night
i
was
interested
in
the
subtle
cunning
of
this
savage
knowing
him
as
i
did
better
perhaps
than
he
was
aware
even
had
i
not
been
advised
before
i
sailed
from
sandy
point
i
should
have
measured
him
for
an
now
moreover
one
of
the
squaws
with
that
spark
of
kindliness
which
is
somehow
found
in
the
breast
of
even
the
lowest
savage
warned
me
by
a
sign
to
be
on
my
guard
or
black
pedro
would
do
me
harm
there
was
no
need
of
the
warning
however
for
i
was
on
my
guard
from
the
first
and
at
that
moment
held
a
smart
revolver
in
my
hand
ready
for
instant
service
when
you
sailed
through
here
before
he
said
you
fired
a
shot
at
me
adding
with
some
warmth
that
it
was
muy
malo
i
affected
not
to
understand
and
said
you
have
lived
at
sandy
point
have
you
not
i
he
answered
frankly
yes
and
appeared
delighted
to
meet
one
who
had
come
from
the
dear
old
place
at
the
mission
i
queried
why
yes
he
replied
stepping
forward
as
if
to
embrace
an
old
friend
i
motioned
him
back
for
i
did
not
share
his
flattering
humor
and
you
know
captain
pedro
samblich
continued
i
yes
said
the
villain
who
had
killed
a
kinsman
of
samblich
yes
indeed
he
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
i
know
it
said
samblich
had
told
me
to
shoot
him
on
sight
pointing
to
my
rifle
on
the
cabin
he
wanted
to
know
how
many
times
it
fired
cuantos
said
he
when
i
explained
to
him
that
that
gun
kept
right
on
shooting
his
jaw
fell
and
he
spoke
of
getting
away
i
did
not
hinder
him
from
going
i
gave
the
squaws
biscuits
and
beef
and
one
of
them
gave
me
several
lumps
of
tallow
in
exchange
and
i
think
it
worth
mentioning
that
she
did
not
offer
me
the
smallest
pieces
but
with
some
extra
trouble
handed
me
the
largest
of
all
the
pieces
in
the
canoe
no
christian
could
have
done
more
before
pushing
off
from
the
sloop
the
cunning
savage
asked
for
matches
and
made
as
if
to
reach
with
the
end
of
his
spear
the
box
i
was
about
to
give
him
but
i
held
it
toward
him
on
the
muzzle
of
my
rifle
the
one
that
kept
on
shooting
the
chap
picked
the
box
off
the
gun
gingerly
enough
to
be
sure
but
he
jumped
when
i
said
quedao
look
out
at
which
the
squaws
laughed
and
seemed
not
at
all
displeased
perhaps
the
wretch
had
clubbed
them
that
morning
for
not
gathering
mussels
enough
for
his
breakfast
there
was
a
good
understanding
among
us
all
from
charles
island
the
crossed
over
to
fortescue
bay
where
she
anchored
and
spent
a
comfortable
night
under
the
lee
of
high
land
while
the
wind
howled
outside
the
bay
was
deserted
now
they
were
fortescue
indians
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
island
and
i
felt
quite
sure
they
could
not
follow
the
in
the
present
hard
blow
not
to
neglect
a
precaution
however
i
sprinkled
tacks
on
deck
before
i
turned
in
on
the
following
day
the
loneliness
of
the
place
was
broken
by
the
appearance
of
a
great
steamship
making
for
the
anchorage
with
a
lofty
bearing
she
was
no
diego
craft
i
knew
the
sheer
the
model
and
the
poise
i
threw
out
my
flag
and
directly
saw
the
stars
and
stripes
flung
to
the
breeze
from
the
great
ship
the
wind
had
then
abated
and
toward
night
the
savages
made
their
appearance
from
the
island
going
direct
to
the
steamer
to
yammerschooner
then
they
came
to
the
to
beg
more
or
to
steal
all
declaring
that
they
got
nothing
from
the
steamer
black
pedro
here
came
alongside
again
my
own
brother
could
not
have
been
more
delighted
to
see
me
and
he
begged
me
to
lend
him
my
rifle
to
shoot
a
guanaco
for
me
in
the
morning
i
assured
the
fellow
that
if
i
remained
there
another
day
i
would
lend
him
the
gun
but
i
had
no
mind
to
remain
i
gave
him
a
cooper
and
some
other
small
implements
which
would
be
of
service
in
and
bade
him
be
off
under
the
cover
of
darkness
that
night
i
went
to
the
steamer
which
i
found
to
be
the
captain
henderson
from
new
york
bound
for
san
francisco
i
carried
all
my
guns
along
with
me
in
case
it
should
be
necessary
to
fight
my
way
back
in
the
chief
mate
of
the
hannibal
i
found
an
old
friend
and
he
referred
affectionately
to
days
in
manila
when
we
were
there
together
he
in
the
and
i
in
the
light
both
ships
as
beautiful
as
their
names
the
had
an
abundance
of
fresh
stores
on
board
the
captain
gave
his
steward
some
order
and
i
remember
that
the
guileless
young
man
asked
me
if
i
could
manage
besides
other
things
a
few
cans
of
milk
and
a
cheese
when
i
offered
my
montevideo
gold
for
the
supplies
the
captain
roared
like
a
lion
and
told
me
to
put
my
money
up
it
was
a
glorious
outfit
of
provisions
of
all
kinds
that
i
got
illustration
a
contrast
in
lighting
the
electric
lights
of
the
and
the
canoe
fires
of
the
fortescue
indians
returning
to
the
where
i
found
all
secure
i
prepared
for
an
early
start
in
the
morning
it
was
agreed
that
the
steamer
should
blow
her
whistle
for
me
if
first
on
the
move
i
watched
the
steamer
off
and
on
through
the
night
for
the
pleasure
alone
of
seeing
her
electric
lights
a
pleasing
sight
in
contrast
to
the
ordinary
fuegian
canoe
with
a
brand
of
fire
in
it
the
sloop
was
the
first
under
way
but
the
soon
following
passed
and
saluted
as
she
went
by
had
the
captain
given
me
his
steamer
his
company
would
have
been
no
worse
off
than
they
were
two
or
three
months
later
i
read
afterward
in
a
late
california
paper
the
will
be
a
total
loss
on
her
second
trip
to
panama
she
was
wrecked
on
the
rocks
of
the
california
coast
the
was
then
beating
against
wind
and
current
as
usual
in
the
strait
at
this
point
the
tides
from
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
meet
and
in
the
strait
as
on
the
outside
coast
their
meeting
makes
a
commotion
of
whirlpools
and
combers
that
in
a
gale
of
wind
is
dangerous
to
canoes
and
other
frail
craft
a
few
miles
farther
along
was
a
large
steamer
ashore
bottom
up
passing
this
place
the
sloop
ran
into
a
streak
of
light
wind
and
then
a
most
remarkable
condition
for
strait
weather
it
fell
entirely
calm
sprang
up
at
once
on
all
sides
and
then
more
than
twenty
canoes
hove
in
sight
all
heading
for
the
as
they
came
within
hail
their
savage
crews
cried
amigo
yammerschooner
anclas
aqui
bueno
puerto
aqui
and
like
scraps
of
spanish
mixed
with
their
own
jargon
i
had
no
thought
of
anchoring
in
their
good
port
i
hoisted
the
sloop
flag
and
fired
a
gun
all
of
which
they
might
construe
as
a
friendly
salute
or
an
invitation
to
come
on
they
drew
up
in
a
semicircle
but
kept
outside
of
eighty
yards
which
in
would
have
been
the
in
their
mosquito
fleet
was
a
ship
boat
stolen
probably
from
a
murdered
crew
six
savages
paddled
this
rather
awkwardly
with
the
blades
of
oars
which
had
been
broken
off
two
of
the
savages
standing
erect
wore
and
this
sustained
the
suspicion
that
they
had
fallen
upon
some
luckless
ship
crew
and
also
added
a
hint
that
they
had
already
visited
the
deck
and
would
now
if
they
could
try
her
again
their
i
have
no
doubt
would
have
protected
their
feet
and
rendered
harmless
paddling
clumsily
they
passed
down
the
strait
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
from
the
sloop
in
an
offhand
manner
and
as
if
bound
to
fortescue
bay
this
i
judged
to
be
a
piece
of
strategy
and
so
kept
a
sharp
lookout
over
a
small
island
which
soon
came
in
range
between
them
and
the
sloop
completely
hiding
them
from
view
and
toward
which
the
was
now
drifting
helplessly
with
the
tide
and
with
every
prospect
of
going
on
the
rocks
for
there
was
no
anchorage
at
least
none
that
my
cables
would
reach
and
sure
enough
i
soon
saw
a
movement
in
the
grass
just
on
top
of
the
island
which
is
called
bonet
island
and
is
one
hundred
and
feet
high
i
fired
several
shots
over
the
place
but
saw
no
other
sign
of
the
savages
it
was
they
that
had
moved
the
grass
for
as
the
sloop
swept
past
the
island
the
rebound
of
the
tide
carrying
her
clear
there
on
the
other
side
was
the
boat
surely
enough
exposing
their
cunning
and
treachery
a
stiff
breeze
coming
up
suddenly
now
scattered
the
canoes
while
it
extricated
the
sloop
from
a
dangerous
position
albeit
the
wind
though
friendly
was
still
ahead
the
flogging

current
and

made
borgia
bay
on
the
following
afternoon
and
cast
anchor
there
for
the
second
time
i
would
now
if
i
could
describe
the
moonlit
scene
on
the
strait
at
midnight
after
i
had
cleared
the
savages
and
bonet
island
a
heavy
that
had
swept
across
the
sky
then
cleared
away
and
the
night
became
suddenly
as
light
as
day
or
nearly
so
a
high
mountain
was
mirrored
in
the
channel
ahead
and
the
sailing
along
with
her
shadow
was
as
two
sloops
on
the
sea
illustration

of
passages
through
the
strait
at
the
head
of
borgia
bay
on
a
small
bush
nearer
the
water
there
was
a
board
bearing
several
other
inscriptions
to
which
were
added
the
words
sloop
march
the
sloop
being
moored
i
threw
out
my
skiff
and
with
ax
and
gun
landed
at
the
head
of
the
cove
and
filled
a
barrel
of
water
from
a
stream
then
as
before
there
was
no
sign
of
indians
at
the
place
finding
it
quite
deserted
i
rambled
about
near
the
beach
for
an
hour
or
more
the
fine
weather
seemed
somehow
to
add
loneliness
to
the
place
and
when
i
came
upon
a
spot
where
a
grave
was
marked
i
went
no
farther
returning
to
the
head
of
the
cove
i
came
to
a
sort
of
calvary
it
appeared
to
me
where
navigators
carrying
their
cross
had
each
set
one
up
as
a
beacon
to
others
coming
after
they
had
anchored
here
and
gone
on
all
except
the
one
under
the
little
mound
one
of
the
simple
marks
curiously
enough
had
been
left
there
by
the
steamship
sister
ship
to
the
my
neighbor
of
that
morning
i
read
the
names
of
many
other
vessels
some
of
them
i
copied
in
my
journal
others
were
illegible
many
of
the
crosses
had
decayed
and
fallen
and
many
a
hand
that
put
them
there
i
had
known
many
a
hand
now
still
the
air
of
depression
was
about
the
place
and
i
hurried
back
to
the
sloop
to
forget
myself
again
in
the
voyage
early
the
next
morning
i
stood
out
from
borgia
bay
and
off
cape
quod
where
the
wind
fell
light
i
moored
the
sloop
by
kelp
in
twenty
fathoms
of
water
and
held
her
there
a
few
hours
against
a
current
that
night
i
anchored
in
langara
cove
a
few
miles
farther
along
where
on
the
following
day
i
discovered
wreckage
and
goods
washed
up
from
the
sea
i
worked
all
day
now
salving
and
boating
off
a
cargo
to
the
sloop
the
bulk
of
the
goods
was
tallow
in
casks
and
in
lumps
from
which
the
casks
had
broken
away
and
embedded
in
the
seaweed
was
a
barrel
of
wine
which
i
also
towed
alongside
i
hoisted
them
all
in
with
the
which
i
took
to
the
windlass
the
weight
of
some
of
the
casks
was
a
little
over
eight
hundred
pounds
illustration
salving
wreckage
there
were
no
indians
about
langara
evidently
there
had
not
been
any
since
the
great
gale
which
had
washed
the
wreckage
on
shore
probably
it
was
the
same
gale
that
drove
the
off
cape
horn
from
march
to
hundreds
of
tons
of
kelp
had
been
torn
from
beds
in
deep
water
and
rolled
up
into
ridges
on
the
beach
a
specimen
stalk
which
i
found
entire
roots
leaves
and
all
measured
one
hundred
and
feet
in
length
at
this
place
i
filled
a
barrel
of
water
at
night
and
on
the
following
day
sailed
with
a
fair
wind
at
last
i
had
not
sailed
far
however
when
i
came
abreast
of
more
tallow
in
a
small
cove
where
i
anchored
and
boated
off
as
before
it
rained
and
snowed
hard
all
that
day
and
it
was
no
light
work
carrying
tallow
in
my
arms
over
the
boulders
on
the
beach
but
i
worked
on
till
the
was
loaded
with
a
full
cargo
i
was
happy
then
in
the
prospect
of
doing
a
good
business
farther
along
on
the
voyage
for
the
habits
of
an
old
trader
would
come
to
the
surface
i
sailed
from
the
cove
about
noon
greased
from
top
to
toe
while
my
vessel
was
tallowed
from
keelson
to
truck
my
cabin
as
well
as
the
hold
and
deck
was
stowed
full
of
tallow
and
all
were
thoroughly

another

had

but
the

was
still

and
i
had
only
miles
to
run
for

a
dreary
enough
place
where
however
i
would
find
a
safe
harbor
in
which
to
refit
and
stow
cargo
i
carried
on
sail
to
make
the
harbor
before
dark
and
she
fairly
flew
along
all
covered
with
snow
which
fell
thick
and
fast
till
she
looked
like
a
white
winter
bird
between
the
i
saw
the
headland
of
my
port
and
was
steering
for
it
when
a
flaw
of
wind
caught
the
mainsail
by
the
lee
jibed
it
over
and
dear
dear
how
nearly
was
this
the
cause
of
disaster
for
the
sheet
parted
and
the
boom
unshipped
and
it
was
then
close
upon
night
i
worked
till
the
perspiration
poured
from
my
body
to
get
things
adjusted
and
in
working
order
before
dark
and
above
all
to
get
it
done
before
the
sloop
drove
to
leeward
of
the
port
of
refuge
even
then
i
did
not
get
the
boom
shipped
in
its
saddle
i
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
before
i
could
get
this
done
and
it
was
time
to
haul
her
to
or
lose
the
port
but
in
that
condition
like
a
bird
with
a
broken
wing
she
made
the
haven
the
accident
which
so
jeopardized
my
vessel
and
cargo
came
of
a
defective
one
made
from
sisal
a
treacherous
fiber
which
has
caused
a
deal
of
strong
language
among
sailors
i
did
not
run
the
into
the
inner
harbor
of
port
angosto
but
came
to
inside
a
bed
of
kelp
under
a
steep
bluff
on
the
port
hand
going
in
it
was
an
exceedingly
snug
nook
and
to
make
doubly
sure
of
holding
on
here
against
all
williwaws
i
moored
her
with
two
anchors
and
secured
her
besides
by
cables
to
trees
however
no
wind
ever
reached
there
except
back
flaws
from
the
mountains
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
harbor
there
as
elsewhere
in
that
region
the
country
was
made
up
of
mountains
this
was
the
place
where
i
was
to
refit
and
whence
i
was
to
sail
direct
once
more
for
cape
pillar
and
the
pacific
i
remained
at
port
angosto
some
days
busily
employed
about
the
sloop
i
stowed
the
tallow
from
the
deck
to
the
hold
arranged
my
cabin
in
better
order
and
took
in
a
good
supply
of
wood
and
water
i
also
mended
the
sloop
sails
and
rigging
and
fitted
a
jigger
which
changed
the
rig
to
a
yawl
though
i
called
the
boat
a
sloop
just
the
same
the
jigger
being
merely
a
temporary
affair
i
never
forgot
even
at
the
busiest
time
of
my
work
there
to
have
my
rifle
by
me
ready
for
instant
use
for
i
was
of
necessity
within
range
of
savages
and
i
had
seen
fuegian
canoes
at
this
place
when
i
anchored
in
the
port
farther
down
the
reach
on
the
first
trip
through
the
strait
i
think
it
was
on
the
second
day
while
i
was
busily
employed
about
decks
that
i
heard
the
swish
of
something
through
the
air
close
by
my
ear
and
heard
a
zip
sound
in
the
water
but
saw
nothing
presently
however
i
suspected
that
it
was
an
arrow
of
some
sort
for
just
then
one
passing
not
far
from
me
struck
the
mainmast
where
it
stuck
fast
vibrating
from
the
shock
a
fuegian
autograph
a
savage
was
somewhere
near
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
i
did
not
know
but
he
might
be
shooting
at
me
with
a
view
to
getting
my
sloop
and
her
cargo
and
so
i
threw
up
my
old
the
rifle
that
kept
on
shooting
and
the
first
shot
uncovered
three
fuegians
who
scampered
from
a
clump
of
bushes
where
they
had
been
concealed
and
made
over
the
hills
i
fired
away
a
good
many
cartridges
aiming
under
their
feet
to
encourage
their
climbing
my
dear
old
gun
woke
up
the
hills
and
at
every
report
all
three
of
the
savages
jumped
as
if
shot
but
they
kept
on
and
put
fuego
real
estate
between
themselves
and
the
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
i
took
care
then
more
than
ever
before
that
all
my
firearms
should
be
in
order
and
that
a
supply
of
ammunition
should
always
be
ready
at
hand
but
the
savages
did
not
return
and
although
i
put
tacks
on
deck
every
night
i
never
discovered
that
any
more
visitors
came
and
i
had
only
to
sweep
the
deck
of
tacks
carefully
every
morning
after
illustration
the
first
shot
uncovered
three
fuegians
as
the
days
went
by
the
season
became
more
favorable
for
a
chance
to
clear
the
strait
with
a
fair
wind
and
so
i
made
up
my
mind
after
six
attempts
being
driven
back
each
time
to
be
in
no
further
haste
to
sail
the
bad
weather
on
my
last
return
to
port
angosto
for
shelter
brought
the
chilean
gunboat
and
the
argentine
cruiser
into
port
as
soon
as
the
latter
came
to
anchor
captain
mascarella
the
commander
sent
a
boat
to
the
with
the
message
that
he
would
take
me
in
tow
for
sandy
point
if
i
would
give
up
the
voyage
and
return
the
thing
farthest
from
my
mind
the
officers
of
the
told
me
that
coming
up
the
strait
after
the
on
her
first
passage
through
they
saw
black
pedro
and
learned
that
he
had
visited
me
the
being
a
foreign
had
no
right
to
arrest
the
fuegian
outlaw
but
her
captain
blamed
me
for
not
shooting
the
rascal
when
he
came
to
my
sloop
i
procured
some
cordage
and
other
small
supplies
from
these
vessels
and
the
officers
of
each
of
them
mustered
a
supply
of
warm
flannels
of
which
i
was
most
in
need
with
these
additions
to
my
outfit
and
with
the
vessel
in
good
trim
though
somewhat
deeply
laden
i
was
well
prepared
for
another
bout
with
the
southern
misnamed
pacific
ocean
in
the
first
week
in
april
southeast
winds
such
as
appear
about
cape
horn
in
the
fall
and
winter
seasons
bringing
better
weather
than
that
experienced
in
the
summer
began
to
disturb
the
upper
clouds
a
little
more
patience
and
the
time
would
come
for
sailing
with
a
fair
wind
at
port
angosto
i
met
professor
dusen
of
the
swedish
scientific
expedition
to
south
america
and
the
pacific
islands
the
professor
was
camped
by
the
side
of
a
brook
at
the
head
of
the
harbor
where
there
were
many
varieties
of
moss
in
which
he
was
interested
and
where
the
water
was
as
his
argentine
cook
said
muy
rico
the
professor
had
three
argentines
along
in
his
camp
to
fight
savages
they
seemed
disgusted
when
i
filled
water
at
a
small
stream
near
the
vessel
slighting
their
advice
to
go
farther
up
to
the
greater
brook
where
it
was
muy
rico
but
they
were
all
fine
fellows
though
it
was
a
wonder
that
they
did
not
all
die
of
rheumatic
pains
from
living
on
wet
ground
of
all
the
little
haps
and
mishaps
to
the
at
port
angosto
of
the
many
attempts
to
put
to
sea
and
of
each
return
for
shelter
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
speak
of
hindrances
there
were
many
to
keep
her
back
but
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
april
and
for
the
seventh
and
last
time
she
weighed
anchor
from
that
port
difficulties
however
multiplied
all
about
in
so
strange
a
manner
that
had
i
been
given
to
superstitious
fears
i
should
not
have
persisted
in
sailing
on
a
thirteenth
day
notwithstanding
that
a
fair
wind
blew
in
the
offing
many
of
the
incidents
were
ludicrous
when
i
found
myself
for
instance
disentangling
the
sloop
mast
from
the
branches
of
a
tree
after
she
had
drifted
three
times
around
a
small
island
against
my
will
it
seemed
more
than
one
nerves
could
bear
and
i
had
to
speak
about
it
so
i
thought
or
die
of
lockjaw
and
i
apostrophized
the
as
an
impatient
farmer
might
his
horse
or
his
ox
did
you
know
cried
i
did
you
know
that
you
could
climb
a
tree
but
the
poor
old
had
essayed
and
successfully
too
nearly
everything
else
in
the
strait
of
magellan
and
my
heart
softened
toward
her
when
i
thought
of
what
she
had
gone
through
moreover
she
had
discovered
an
island
on
the
charts
this
one
that
she
had
sailed
around
was
traced
as
a
point
of
land
i
named
it
alan
erric
island
after
a
worthy
literary
friend
whom
i
had
met
in
strange
and
i
put
up
a
sign
keep
off
the
grass
which
as
discoverer
was
within
my
rights
now
at
last
the
carried
me
free
of
tierra
del
fuego
if
by
a
close
shave
only
still
she
carried
me
clear
though
her
boom
actually
hit
the
beacon
rocks
to
leeward
as
she
lugged
on
sail
to
clear
the
point
the
thing
was
done
on
the
of
april
but
a
close
shave
and
a
narrow
escape
were
nothing
new
to
the
the
waves
doffed
their
white
caps
beautifully
to
her
in
the
strait
that
day
before
the
southeast
wind
the
first
true
winter
breeze
of
the
season
from
that
quarter
and
here
she
was
out
on
the
first
of
it
with
every
prospect
of
clearing
cape
pillar
before
it
should
shift
so
it
turned
out
the
wind
blew
hard
as
it
always
blows
about
cape
horn
but
she
had
cleared
the
great
off
cape
pillar
and
the
evangelistas
the
outermost
rocks
of
all
before
the
change
came
i
remained
at
the
helm
humoring
my
vessel
in
the
cross
seas
for
it
was
rough
and
i
did
not
dare
to
let
her
take
a
straight
course
it
was
necessary
to
change
her
course
in
the
combing
seas
to
meet
them
with
what
skill
i
could
when
they
rolled
up
ahead
and
to
keep
off
when
they
came
up
abeam
on
the
following
morning
april
only
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
were
in
sight
and
the
making
good
headway
on
a
northwest
course
soon
sank
these
out
of
sight
hurrah
for
the
i
shouted
to
seals
and
penguins
for
there
were
no
other
living
creatures
about
and
she
had
weathered
all
the
dangers
of
cape
horn
moreover
she
had
on
her
voyage
round
the
horn
salved
a
cargo
of
which
she
had
not
jettisoned
a
pound
and
why
should
not
one
rejoice
also
in
the
main
chance
coming
so
of
itself
i
shook
out
a
reef
and
set
the
whole
jib
for
having
i
could
square
away
two
points
this
brought
the
sea
more
on
her
quarter
and
she
was
the
wholesomer
under
a
press
of
sail
occasionally
an
old
southwest
sea
rolling
up
combed
athwart
her
but
did
no
harm
the
wind
freshened
as
the
sun
rose
or
more
and
the
air
a
bit
chilly
in
the
morning
softened
later
in
the
day
but
i
gave
little
thought
to
such
things
as
these
one
wave
in
the
evening
larger
than
others
that
had
threatened
all
day
one
such
as
sailors
call
seas
over
the
sloop
fore
and
aft
it
washed
over
me
at
the
helm
the
last
that
swept
over
the
off
cape
horn
it
seemed
to
wash
away
old
regrets
all
my
troubles
were
now
astern
summer
was
ahead
all
the
world
was
again
before
me
the
wind
was
even
literally
fair
my
trick
at
the
wheel
was
now
up
and
it
was
i
had
stood
at
the
helm
since
eleven
the
morning
before
or
thirty
hours
then
was
the
time
to
uncover
my
head
for
i
sailed
alone
with
god
the
vast
ocean
was
again
around
me
and
the
horizon
was
unbroken
by
land
a
few
days
later
the
was
under
full
sail
and
i
saw
her
for
the
first
time
with
a
jigger
spread
this
was
indeed
a
small
incident
but
it
was
the
incident
following
a
triumph
the
wind
was
still
southwest
but
it
had
moderated
and
roaring
seas
had
turned
to
gossiping
waves
that
rippled
and
pattered
against
her
sides
as
she
rolled
among
them
delighted
with
their
story
rapid
changes
went
on
those
days
in
things
all
about
while
she
headed
for
the
tropics
new
species
of
birds
came
around
albatrosses
fell
back
and
became
scarcer
and
scarcer
lighter
gulls
came
in
their
stead
and
pecked
for
crumbs
in
the
sloop
wake
on
the
tenth
day
from
cape
pillar
a
shark
came
along
the
first
of
its
kind
on
this
part
of
the
voyage
to
get
into
trouble
i
harpooned
him
and
took
out
his
ugly
jaws
i
had
not
till
then
felt
inclined
to
take
the
life
of
any
animal
but
when
john
shark
hove
in
sight
my
sympathy
flew
to
the
winds
it
is
a
fact
that
in
magellan
i
let
pass
many
ducks
that
would
have
made
a
good
stew
for
i
had
no
mind
in
the
lonesome
strait
to
take
the
life
of
any
living
thing
from
cape
pillar
i
steered
for
juan
fernandez
and
on
the
of
april
fifteen
days
out
made
that
historic
island
right
ahead
the
blue
hills
of
juan
fernandez
high
among
the
clouds
could
be
seen
about
thirty
miles
off
a
thousand
emotions
thrilled
me
when
i
saw
the
island
and
i
bowed
my
head
to
the
deck
we
may
mock
the
oriental
salaam
but
for
my
part
i
could
find
no
other
way
of
expressing
myself
the
wind
being
light
through
the
day
the
did
not
reach
the
island
till
night
with
what
wind
there
was
to
fill
her
sails
she
stood
close
in
to
shore
on
the
northeast
side
where
it
fell
calm
and
remained
so
all
night
i
saw
the
twinkling
of
a
small
light
farther
along
in
a
cove
and
fired
a
gun
but
got
no
answer
and
soon
the
light
disappeared
altogether
i
heard
the
sea
booming
against
the
cliffs
all
night
and
realized
that
the
ocean
swell
was
still
great
although
from
the
deck
of
my
little
ship
it
was
apparently
small
from
the
cry
of
animals
in
the
hills
which
sounded
fainter
and
fainter
through
the
night
i
judged
that
a
light
current
was
drifting
the
sloop
from
the
land
though
she
seemed
all
night
dangerously
near
the
shore
for
the
land
being
very
high
appearances
were
deceptive
illustration
the
approaching
juan
fernandez
robinson
crusoe
island
soon
after
daylight
i
saw
a
boat
putting
out
toward
me
as
it
pulled
near
it
so
happened
that
i
picked
up
my
gun
which
was
on
the
deck
meaning
only
to
put
it
below
but
the
people
in
the
boat
seeing
the
piece
in
my
hands
quickly
turned
and
pulled
back
for
shore
which
was
about
four
miles
distant
there
were
six
rowers
in
her
and
i
observed
that
they
pulled
with
oars
in
after
the
manner
of
trained
seamen
and
so
i
knew
they
belonged
to
a
civilized
race
but
their
opinion
of
me
must
have
been
anything
but
flattering
when
they
mistook
my
purpose
with
the
gun
and
pulled
away
with
all
their
might
i
made
them
understand
by
signs
but
not
without
difficulty
that
i
did
not
intend
to
shoot
that
i
was
simply
putting
the
piece
in
the
cabin
and
that
i
wished
them
to
return
when
they
understood
my
meaning
they
came
back
and
were
soon
on
board
one
of
the
party
whom
the
rest
called
king
spoke
english
the
others
spoke
spanish
they
had
all
heard
of
the
voyage
of
the
through
the
papers
of
valparaiso
and
were
hungry
for
news
concerning
it
they
told
me
of
a
war
between
chile
and
the
argentine
which
i
had
not
heard
of
when
i
was
there
i
had
just
visited
both
countries
and
i
told
them
that
according
to
the
latest
reports
while
i
was
in
chile
their
own
island
was
sunk
this
same
report
that
juan
fernandez
had
sunk
was
current
in
australia
when
i
arrived
there
three
months
later
i
had
already
prepared
a
pot
of
coffee
and
a
plate
of
doughnuts
which
after
some
words
of
civility
the
islanders
stood
up
to
and
discussed
with
a
will
after
which
they
took
the
in
tow
of
their
boat
and
made
toward
the
island
with
her
at
the
rate
of
a
good
three
knots
the
man
they
called
king
took
the
helm
and
with
whirling
it
up
and
down
he
so
rattled
the
that
i
thought
she
would
never
carry
herself
straight
again
the
others
pulled
away
lustily
with
their
oars
the
king
i
soon
learned
was
king
only
by
courtesy
having
lived
longer
on
the
island
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
thirty
years
he
was
so
dubbed
juan
fernandez
was
then
under
the
administration
of
a
governor
of
swedish
nobility
so
i
was
told
i
was
also
told
that
his
daughter
could
ride
the
wildest
goat
on
the
island
the
governor
at
the
time
of
my
visit
was
away
at
valparaiso
with
his
family
to
place
his
children
at
school
the
king
had
been
away
once
for
a
year
or
two
and
in
rio
de
janeiro
had
married
a
brazilian
woman
who
followed
his
fortunes
to
the
island
he
was
himself
a
portuguese
and
a
native
of
the
azores
he
had
sailed
in
new
bedford
and
had
steered
a
boat
all
this
i
learned
and
more
too
before
we
reached
the
anchorage
the
coming
in
before
long
filled
the
sails
and
the
experienced
portuguese
mariner
piloted
her
to
a
safe
berth
in
the
bay
where
she
was
moored
to

the

returned
to

and
i
was
more
than
flattered
when
they
did
not
slight
my
buns
as
the
professor
had
done
in
the
strait
of
magellan
between
buns
and
doughnuts
there
was
little
difference
except
in
name
both
had
been
fried
in
tallow
which
was
the
strong
point
in
both
for
there
was
nothing
on
the
island
fatter
than
a
goat
and
a
goat
is
but
a
lean
beast
to
make
the
best
of
it
so
with
a
view
to
business
i
hooked
my
steelyards
to
the
boom
at
once
ready
to
weigh
out
tallow
there
being
no
customs
officer
to
say
why
do
you
do
so
and
before
the
sun
went
down
the
islanders
had
learned
the
art
of
making
buns
and
doughnuts
i
did
not
charge
a
high
price
for
what
i
sold
but
the
ancient
and
curious
coins
i
got
in
payment
some
of
them
from
the
wreck
of
a
galleon
sunk
in
the
bay
no
one
knows
when
i
sold
afterward
to
antiquarians
for
more
than
in
this
way
i
made
a
reasonable
profit
i
brought
away
money
of
all
denominations
from
the
island
and
nearly
all
there
was
so
far
as
i
could
find
out

are

no

other
than

i

a
number
with

a

the
people
lived
without
the
use
of
rum
or
beer
of
any
sort
there
was
not
a
police
officer
or
a
lawyer
among
them
the
domestic
economy
of
the
island
was
simplicity
itself
the
fashions
of
paris
did
not
affect
the
inhabitants
each
dressed
according
to
his
own
taste
although
there
was
no

the
people
were

were

the
pleasantest
on
my

was
my
last
day
on

by
no

it
was
the
last
when
the
children

community
one

all
went
out
with
me

gather
wild
fruits

found

the
children
gathered

never

loaded

when
i
told

they
pointed

was
only
a
goat
they
screamed
with
laughter
and
rolled
on
the
grass

wild
delight
to
think
that

man
had

the
greatest
drawback
i
saw
in
the
island
was
the
want
of
a

a
class
there
would
necessarily
be
small
but
to
some
kind

for

be
one
of
delight

sailed
from

feasted
on
many
things
but
on
nothing
sweeter
than
the
adventure
itself

a
visit
to
the

to
the
very
cave

seemed

the
west
which
she
made

the
day
out
and
still
kept
on
sailing
my
time
was
all
taken
up
those
days
not
by
standing
at
the
helm
no
man
i
think
could
stand
or
sit
and
steer
a
vessel
round
the
world
i
did
better
than
that
for
i
sat
and
read
my
books
mended
my
clothes
or
cooked
my
meals
and
ate
them
in
peace
i
had
already
found
that
it
was
not
good
to
be
alone
and
so
i
made
companionship
with
what
there
was
around
me
sometimes
with
the
universe
and
sometimes
with
my
own
insignificant
self
but
my
books
were
always
my
friends
let
fail
all
else
nothing
could
be
easier
or
more
restful
than
my
voyage
in
the
i
sailed
with
a
free
wind
day
after
day
marking
the
position
of
my
ship
on
the
chart
with
considerable
precision
but
this
was
done
by
intuition
i
think
more
than
by
slavish
calculations
for
one
whole
month
my
vessel
held
her
course
true
i
had
not
the
while
so
much
as
a
light

the
binnacle

astern
every
evening
it
went
down
ahead
i
wished
for
no
other
compass
to
guide
me
for
these
were
true
if
i
doubted
my
reckoning
after
a
long
time
at
sea
i
verified
it
by
reading
the
clock
aloft
made
by
the
great
architect
and
it
was
right
there
was
no
denying
that
the
comical
side
of
the
strange
life
appeared
i
awoke
sometimes
to
find
the
sun
already
shining
into
my
cabin
i
heard
water
rushing
by
with
only
a
thin
plank
between
me
and
the
depths
and
i
said
how
is
this
but
it
was
all
right
it
was
my
ship
on
her
course
sailing
as
no
other
ship
had
ever
sailed
before
in
the
world
the
rushing
water
along
her
side
told
me
that
she
was
sailing
at
full
speed
i
knew
that
no
human
hand
was
at
the
helm
i
knew
that
all
was
well
with
the
hands
forward
and
that
there
was
no
mutiny
on
board
the
phenomena
of
ocean
meteorology
were
interesting
studies
even
here
in
the
i
observed
that
about
every
seven
days
the
wind
freshened
and
drew
several
points
farther
than
usual
from
the
direction
of
the
pole
that
is
it
went
round
from
to
while
at
the
same
time
a
heavy
swell
rolled
up
from
the
southwest
all
this
indicated
that
gales
were
going
on
in
the
the
wind
then
hauled
day
after
day
as
it
moderated
till
it
stood
again
at
the
normal
point
this
is
more
or
less
the
constant
state
of
the
winter
trades
in
latitude
degrees
where
i
ran
down
the
longitude
for
weeks
the
sun
we
all
know
is
the
creator
of
the
and
of
the
wind
system
over
all
the
earth
but
ocean
meteorology
is
i
think
the
most
fascinating
of
all
from
juan
fernandez
to
the
marquesas
i
experienced
six
changes
of
these
great
palpitations
of
and
of
the
sea
itself
the
effect
of
gales
to
know
the
laws
that
govern
the
winds
and
to
know
that
you
know
them
will
give
you
an
easy
mind
on
your
voyage
round
the
world
otherwise
you
may
tremble
at
the
appearance
of
every
cloud
what
is
true
of
this
in
the
is
much
more
so
in
the
variables
where
changes
run
more
to
extremes
to
cross
the
pacific
ocean
even
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
brings
you
for
many
days
close
to
nature
and
you
realize
the
vastness
of
the
sea
slowly
but
surely
the
mark
of
my
little
ship
course
on
the
reached
out
on
the
ocean
and
across
it
while
at
her
utmost
speed
she
marked
with
her
keel
still
slowly
the
sea
that
carried
her
on
the
day
from
land
a
long
time
to
be
at
sea
alone
the
sky
being
beautifully
clear
and
the
moon
being
in
distance
with
the
sun
i
threw
up
my
sextant
for
sights
i
found
from
the
result
of
three
observations
after
long
wrestling
with
lunar
tables
that
her
longitude
by
observation
agreed
within
five
miles
of
that
by
this
was
wonderful
both
however
might
be
in
error
but
somehow
i
felt
confident
that
both
were
nearly
true
and
that
in
a
few
hours
more
i
should
see
land
and
so
it
happened
for
then
i
made
the
island
of
nukahiva
the
southernmost
of
the
marquesas
group
and
lofty
the
verified
longitude
when
abreast
was
somewhere
between
the
two
reckonings
this
was
extraordinary
all
navigators
will
tell
you
that
from
one
day
to
another
a
ship
may
lose
or
gain
more
than
five
miles
in
her
and
again
in
the
matter
of
lunars
even
expert
lunarians
are
considered
as
doing
clever
work
when
they
average
within
eight
miles
of
the
truth
i
hope
i
am
making
it
clear
that
i
do
not
lay
claim
to
cleverness
or
to
slavish
calculations
in
my
reckonings
i
think
i
have
already
stated
that
i
kept
my
longitude
at
least
mostly
by
intuition
a
rotator
log
always
towed
astern
but
so
much
has
to
be
allowed
for
currents
and
for
drift
which
the
log
never
shows
that
it
is
only
an
approximation
after
all
to
be
corrected
by
one
own
judgment
from
data
of
a
thousand
voyages
and
even
then
the
master
of
the
ship
if
he
be
wise
cries
out
for
the
lead
and
the
lookout
unique
was
my
experience
in
nautical
astronomy
from
the
deck
of
the
so
much
so
that
i
feel
justified
in
briefly
telling
it
here
the
first
set
of
sights
just
spoken
of
put
her
many
hundred
miles
west
of
my
reckoning
by
account
i
knew
that
this
could
not
be
correct
in
about
an
hour
time
i
took
another
set
of
observations
with
the
utmost
care
the
mean
result
of
these
was
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
first
set
i
asked
myself
why
with
my
boasted
i
had
not
done
at
least
better
than
this
then
i
went
in
search
of
a
discrepancy
in
the
tables
and
i
found
it
in
the
tables
i
found
that
the
column
of
figures
from
which
i
had
got
an
important
logarithm
was
in
error
it
was
a
matter
i
could
prove
beyond
a
doubt
and
it
made
the
difference
as
already
stated
the
tables
being
corrected
i
sailed
on
with
unshaken
and
with
my
tin
clock
fast
asleep
the
result
of
these
observations
naturally
tickled
my
vanity
for
i
knew
that
it
was
something
to
stand
on
a
great
ship
deck
and
with
two
assistants
take
lunar
observations
approximately
near
the
truth
as
one
of
the
poorest
of
american
sailors
i
was
proud
of
the
little
achievement
alone
on
the
sloop
even
by
chance
though
it
may
have
been
i
was
now
with
my
surroundings
and
was
carried
on
a
vast
stream
where
i
felt
the
buoyancy
of
his
hand
who
made
all
the
worlds
i
realized
the
mathematical
truth
of
their
motions
so
well
known
that
astronomers
compile
tables
of
their
positions
through
the
years
and
the
days
and
the
minutes
of
a
day
with
such
precision
that
one
coming
along
over
the
sea
even
five
years
later
may
by
their
aid
find
the
standard
time
of
any
given
meridian
on
the
earth
to
find
local
time
is
a
simpler
matter
the
difference
between
local
and
standard
time
is
longitude
expressed
in
time
four
minutes
we
all
know
representing
one
degree
this
briefly
is
the
principle
on
which
longitude
is
found
independent
of
chronometers
the
work
of
the
lunarian
though
seldom
practised
in
these
days
of
chronometers
is
beautifully
edifying
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
realm
of
navigation
that
lifts
one
heart
up
more

adoration

flew

instead

i
could
have

well
as
not
i
kept
on
for

where
i
wished
to

my

this
occupied
days
more
making
days
in
all
i
was
not
distressed
in
any
way
during
that
time
there
was
no
end
of
companionship
the
very
coral
reefs
kept
me
company
or
gave
me
no
time
to
feel
lonely
which
is
the
same
thing
and
there
were
many
of
them
now
in
my
course
to
samoa
first
among
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
from
juan
fernandez
to
samoa
which
were
not
many
was
a
narrow
escape
from
collision
with
a
great
whale
that
was
plowing
the
ocean
at
night
while
i
was
below
the
noise
from
his
startled
snort
and
the
commotion
he
made
in
the
sea
as
he
turned
to
clear
my
vessel
brought
me
on
deck
in
time
to
catch
a
wetting
from
the
water
he
threw
up
with
his
flukes
the
monster
was
apparently
frightened
he
headed
quickly
for
the
east
i
kept
on
going
west
soon
another
whale
passed
evidently
a
companion
following
in
its
wake
i
saw
no
more
on
this
part
of
the
voyage
nor
did
i

after

are

nothing
is

to
the

of

i

than
a
possible
encounter
with
a
hungry
shark
a
number
of
birds
were
always
about
occasionally
one
poised
on
the
mast
to
look
the
over
wondering
perhaps
at
her
odd
wings
for
she
now
wore
her

which
like
joseph

was
made

pieces
ships
are
less
common
on
the
southern
seas
than
formerly
i
saw
not
one
in
the
many
days
crossing
the
pacific
my
diet
on
these
long
passages
usually
consisted
of
potatoes
and
salt
cod
and
biscuits
which
i
made
two
or
three
times
a
week
i
had
always
plenty
of
coffee
tea
sugar
and
flour
i
carried
usually
a
good
supply
of
potatoes
but
before
reaching
samoa
i
had
a
mishap
which
left
me
destitute
of
this
highly
prized
sailors
luxury
through
meeting
at
juan
fernandez
the
yankee
portuguese
named
manuel
carroza
who
nearly
traded
me
out
of
my
boots
i
ran
out
of
potatoes
in
and
was
wretched
thereafter
i
prided
myself
on
being
something
of
a
trader
but
this
portuguese
from
the
azores
by
way
of
new
bedford
who
gave
me
new
potatoes
for
the
older
ones
i
had
got
from
the
a
bushel
or
more
of
the
best
left
me
no
ground
for
boasting
he
wanted
mine
he
said
for
changee
the
seed
when
i
got
to
sea
i
found
that
his
tubers
were
rank
and
unedible
and
full
of
fine
yellow
streaks
of
repulsive
appearance
i
tied
the
sack
up
and
returned
to
the
few
left
of
my
old
stock
thinking
that
maybe
when
i
got
right
hungry
the
island
potatoes
would
improve
in
flavor
three
weeks
later
i
opened
the
bag
again
and
out
flew
millions
of
winged
insects
manuel
potatoes
had
all
turned
to
moths
i
tied
them
up
quickly
and
threw
all
into
the
sea
manuel
had
a
large
crop
of
potatoes
on
hand
and
as
a
hint
to
whalemen
who
are
always
eager
to
buy
vegetables
he
wished
me
to
report
whales
off
the
island
of
juan
fernandez
which
i
have
already
done
and
big
ones
at
that
but
they
were
a
long
way
off
taking
things
by
and
large
as
sailors
say
i
got
on
fairly
well
in
the
matter
of
provisions
even
on
the
long
voyage
across
the
pacific
i
found
always
some
small
stores
to
help
the
fare
of
luxuries
what
i
lacked
of
fresh
meat
was
made
up
in
fresh
fish
at
least
while
in
the
where
crossing
on
the
wing
at
night
would
hit
the
sails
and
fall
on
deck
sometimes
two
or
three
of
them
sometimes
a
dozen
every
morning
except
when
the
moon
was
large
i
got
a
bountiful
supply
by
merely
picking
them
up
from
the
lee
scuppers
all
tinned
meats
went
begging
on
the
of

after
considerable
care
and
some
skill
and
hard
work
the
cast

at
apia
in
the

of
samoa
about
noon
my
vessel
being
moored
i
spread
an
awning
and
instead
of
going
at
once
on
shore
i
sat
under
it
till
late
in
the
evening
listening
with
delight
to
the
musical
voices
of
the
samoan
men
and
women
a
canoe
coming
down
the
harbor

three
young

with

that
rolled
across
to
the
grove
of
tall
palms
on
the

side
of
the

and
back
soon
after
this
six
young

came
down
in

singing
in

picked
the

saw
to

that

robert
louis
stevenson
came
to
the
and
invited
me
to
vailima
the
following
day
i
was
of
course
thrilled
when
i
found
myself
after
so
many
days
of
adventure
face
to
face
with
this
bright
woman
so
lately
the
companion
of
the
author
who
had
delighted
me
on
the
voyage
the
kindly
eyes
that
looked
me
through
and
through
sparkled
when
we
compared
notes
of
adventure
i
marveled
at
some
of
her
experiences
and
escapes
she
told
me
that
along
with
her
husband
she
had
voyaged
in
all
manner
of
rickety
craft
among
the
islands
of
the
pacific
reflectively
adding
our
tastes
were
similar
following
the
subject
of
voyages
she
gave
me
the
four
beautiful
volumes
of
sailing
directories
for
the
mediterranean
writing
on
the
of
the
first
to
captain
slocum
these
volumes
have
been
read
and
many
times
by
my
husband
and
i
am
very
sure
that
he
would
be
pleased
that
they
should
be
passed
on
to
the
sort
of
seafaring
man
that
he
liked
above
all
others

stevenson
also
gave
me
a
great
directory
of

it
was
not
without
a
feeling
of
reverential
awe
that
i
received
the
books

the
home
of
robert

stevenson
the
novelist
stepson
lloyd
osbourne
walked
through
the
vailima
mansion
with
me
and
bade
me
write
my
letters
at
the
old
desk
i
thought
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
do
that
it
was
sufficient
for
me
to
enter
the
hall
on
the
floor
of
which
the
writer
of
tales
according
to
the
samoan
custom
was
wont
to
sit
coming
through
the
main
street
of
apia
one
day
with
my
hosts
all
bound
for
the
stevenson
on
horseback
i
walking
by
her
side
and
and
osbourne
close
in
our
wake
on
bicycles
at
a
sudden
turn
in
the
road
we
found
ourselves
mixed
with
a
remarkable
native
procession
with
a
somewhat
primitive
band
of
music
in
front
of
us
while
behind
was
a
festival
or
a
funeral
we
could
not
tell
which
several
of
the
stoutest
men
carried
bales
and
bundles
on
poles
some
were
evidently
bales
of
the
burden
of
one
set
of
poles
heavier
than
the
rest
however
was
not
so
easily
made
out
my
curiosity
was
whetted
to
know
whether
it
was
a
roast
pig
or
something
of
a
gruesome
nature
and
i
inquired
about
it
i
do
know
said
stevenson
whether
this
is
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
whatever
it
is
though

seems
to
be
at
the

our

loaded
it

and
i
was

to

with
great
care
to
avoid

stevenson
greatly
and
as
we
paddled
along
she

went
to

a
boat
i
could
understand
her
saying
of
her
husband
and
herself
our
tastes
were
similar
as
i
sailed
farther
from
the
center
of
civilization
i
heard
less
and
less
of
what
would
and
what
would
not
pay
stevenson
in
speaking
of
my
voyage
did
not
once
ask
me
what
i
would
make
out
of
it
when
i
came
to
a
samoan
village
the
chief
did
not
ask
the
price
of
gin
or
say
how
much
will
you
pay
for
roast
pig
but
dollar
dollar
said
he
white
man
know
only
dollar
never
mind
dollar

prepared

let
us
drink
and
rejoice
the
tapo

hostess
of
the

in
this
instance
it
was
taloa
daughter
of
the
chief
our
taro
is
good
let
us
eat
on
the
tree
there
is

let
the
day
go
by
why
should
we
mourn
over
that
there
are
millions
of
days
coming
the
breadfruit
is
yellow
in
the
sun
and
from
the
is
taloa

our
house
which
is
good
cost
but
the
labor
of
building
it
and
there
is
no
lock
on
the
door
while
the
days
go
thus
in
these
southern
islands
we
at
the
north
are
struggling
for
the
bare
necessities
of
life
for
food
the
islanders
have
only
to
put
out
their
hand
and
take
what
nature
has
provided
for
them
if
they
plant
a
their
only
care
afterward
is
to
see
that
too
many
trees
do
not
grow
they
have
great
reason
to
love
their
country
and
to
fear
the
white
man
yoke
for
once
harnessed
to
the
plow
their
life
would
no
longer
be
a
poem
the
chief
of
the
village
of
caini
who
was
a
tall
and
dignified
tonga
man
could
be
approached
only
through
an
interpreter
and
talking
man
it
was
perfectly
natural
for
him
to
inquire
the
object
of
my
visit
and
i
was
sincere
when
i
told
him
that
my
reason
for
casting
anchor
in
samoa
was
to
see
their
fine
men
and
fine
women
too
after
a
considerable
pause
the
chief
said
the
captain
has
come
a
long
way
to
see
so
little
but
he
added
the
tapo
must
sit
nearer
the
captain
yack
said
taloa
who
had
so
nearly
learned
to
say
yes
in
english
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
hitched
a
peg
nearer
all
hands
sitting
in
a
circle
upon
mats
i
was
no
less
taken
with
the
chiefs
eloquence
than
delighted
with
the
simplicity
of
all
he
said
about
him
there
was
nothing
pompous
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
great
scholar
or
statesman
the
least
assuming
of
the
men
i
met
on
the
voyage
as
for
taloa
a
sort
of
queen
of
the
may
and
the
other
tapo
girls
well
it
is
wise
to
learn
as
soon
as
possible
the
manners
and
customs
of
these
hospitable
people
and
meanwhile
not
to
mistake
for
that
which
is
intended
as
honor
to
a
guest
i
was
fortunate
in
my
travels
in
the
islands
and
saw
nothing
to
shake
faith
in
native
virtue
to
the
unconventional
mind
the
punctilious
etiquette
of
samoa
is
perhaps
a
little
painful
for
instance
i
found
that
in
partaking
of
ava
the
social
bowl
i
was
supposed
to
toss
a
little
of
the
beverage
over
my
shoulder
or
pretend
to
do
so
and
say
let
the
gods
drink
and
then
drink
it
all
myself
and
the
dish
invariably
a
being
empty
i
might
not
pass
it
politely
as
we
would
do
but
politely
throw
it
twirling
across
the
mats
at
the
tapo
my
most
grievous
mistake
while
at
the
islands
was
made
on
a
nag
which
inspired
by
a
bit
of
good
road
must
needs
break
into
a
smart
trot
through
a
village
i
was
instantly
hailed
by
the
chief
deputy
who
in
an
angry
voice
brought
me
to
a
halt
perceiving
that
i
was
in
trouble
i
made
signs
for
pardon
the
safest
thing
to
do
though
i
did
not
know
what
offense
i
had
committed
my
interpreter
coming
up
however
put
me
right
but
not
until
a
long
palaver
had
ensued
the
deputy
hail
liberally
translated
was
ahoy
there
on
the
frantic
steed
know
you
not
that
it
is
against
the
law
to
ride
thus
through
the
village
of
our
fathers
i
made
what
apologies
i
could
and
offered
to
dismount
and
like
my
servant
lead
my
nag
by
the
bridle
this
the
interpreter
told
me
would
also
be
a
grievous
wrong
and
so
i
again
begged
for
pardon
i
was
summoned
to
appear
before
a
chief
but
my
interpreter
being
a
wit
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
rogue
explained
that
i
was
myself
something
of
a
chief
and
should
not
be
detained
being
on
a
most
important
mission
in
my
own
behalf
i
could
only
say
that
i
was
a
stranger
but
pleading
all
this
i
knew
i
still
deserved
to
be
roasted
at
which
the
chief
showed
a
fine
row
of
teeth
and
seemed
pleased
but
allowed
me
to
pass
on
illustration
the
course
from
the
strait
of
magellan
to
torres
strait
illustration
the
course
from
australia
to
south
africa
the
chief
of
the
tongas
and
his
family
at
caini
returning
my
visit
brought
presents
of
and
fruits
taloa
the
princess
brought
a
bottle
of
for
my
hair
which
another
man
might
have
regarded
as
coming
late
it
was
impossible
to
entertain
on
the
after
the
royal
manner
in
which
i
had
been
received
by
the
chief
his
fare
had
included
all
that
the
land
could
afford
fruits
fowl
fishes
and
flesh
a
hog
having
been
roasted
whole
i
set
before
them
boiled
salt
pork
and
salt
beef
with
which
i
was
well
supplied
and
in
the
evening
took
them
all
to
a
new
amusement
in
the
town
a
which
they
called
a
meaning
theater
and
in
a
spirit
of
justice
they
pulled
off
the
horses
tails
for
the
proprietors
of
the
show
two
countrymen
of
mine
i
grieve
to
say
unceremoniously
hustled
them
off
for
a
new
set
almost
at
the
first
spin
i
was
not
a
little
proud
of
my
tonga
friends
the
chief
finest
of
them
all
carried
a
portentous
club
as
for
the
theater
through
the
greed
of
the
proprietors
it
was
becoming
unpopular
and
the
representatives
of
the
three
great
powers
in
want
of
laws
which
they
could
enforce
adopted
a
vigorous
foreign
policy
taxing
it
per
cent
on
the
this
was
considered
a
great
stroke
of
legislative
reform
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
native
visitors
to
the
to
come
over
the
bows
where
they
could
reach
the
and
climb
aboard
with
ease
and
on
going
ashore
to
jump
off
the
stern
and
swim
away
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightfully
simple
the
modest
natives
wore
a
native
cloth
from
the
bark
of
the
and
they
did
no
harm
to
the
in
samoa
their
coming
and
going
was
only
a
merry
scene
one
day
the
head
teachers
of
papauta
college
miss
schultze
and
miss
moore
came
on
board
with
their
young
women
students
they
were
all
dressed
in
white
and
each
wore
a
red
rose
and
of
course
came
in
boats
or
canoes
in
the
style
a
merrier
bevy
of
girls
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
as
soon
as
they
got
on
deck
by
request
of
one
of
the
teachers
they
sang
the
watch
on
the
rhine
which
i
had
never
heard
before
and
now
said
they
all
let
up
anchor
and
away
but
i
had
no
inclination
to
sail
from
samoa
so
soon
on
leaving
the
these
accomplished
young
women
each
seized
a
or
paddle
or
whatever
else
would
serve
the
purpose
and
literally
paddled
her
own
canoe
each
could
have
swum
as
readily
and
would
have
done
so
i
dare
say
had
it
not
been
for
the
holiday
muslin
it
was
not
uncommon
at
apia
to
see
a
young
woman
swimming
alongside
a
small
canoe
with
a
passenger
for
the
trood
an
old
eton
boy
came
in
this
manner
to
see
me
and
he
exclaimed
was
ever
king
ferried
in
such
state
then
suiting
his
action
to
the
sentiment
he
gave
the
damsel
pieces
of
silver
till
the
natives
watching
on
shore
yelled
with
envy
my
own
canoe
a
small
dugout
one
day
when
it
had
rolled
over
with
me
was
seized
by
a
party
of
fair
bathers
and
before
i
could
get
my
breath
almost
was
towed
around
and
around
the
while
i
sat
in
the
bottom
of
it
wondering
what
they
would
do
next
but
in
this
case
there
were
six
of
them
three
on
a
side
and
i
could
not
help
myself
one
of
the
sprites
i
remember
was
a
young
english
lady
who
made
more
sport
of
it
than
any
of
the
others

the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
young
the
father
of
the
late
queen
margaret
who
was
queen
of
manua
from
to
her
grandfather
was
an
english
sailor
who
married
a
princess
young

the
only
survivor
of
the
family
two
of
his
children
the
last
of
them
all
having
been
lost
in
an

trader
which
a
few
months
before
had
sailed
never
to
return
young
was
a
christian
gentleman
and
his
daughter
margaret
was
accomplished
in
graces
that
would
become
any
lady
it
was
with
pain
that
i
saw
in
the
newspapers
a
sensational
account
of
her
life
and
death
taken
evidently
from
a
paper
in
the
supposed
interest
of
a
benevolent
society
but
without
foundation
in
fact
and
the
startling
saying
queen
margaret
of
manua
is
dead
could
hardly
be
called
news
in
the
queen
having
then
been
dead
three
years
while
hobnobbing
as
it
were
with
royalty
i
called
on
the
king
himself
the
late
malietoa
king
malietoa
was
a
great
ruler
he
never
got
less
than
dollars
a
month
for
the
job
as
he
told
me
himself
and
this
amount
had
lately
been
raised
so
that
he
could
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
not
any
longer
be
called
malietoa
by
graceless
as
my
interpreter
and
i
entered
the
front
door
of
the
palace
the
king
brother
who
was
viceroy
sneaked
in
through
a
by
the
back
way
and
sat
cowering
by
the
door
while
i
told
my
story
to
the
king
w
new
york
a
gentleman
interested
in
missionary
work
had
charged
me
when
i
sailed
to
give
his
remembrance
to
the
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
other
islands
of
course
being
meant
but
the
good
king
malietoa
notwithstanding
that
his
people
have
not
eaten
a
missionary
in
a
hundred
years
received
the
message
himself
and
seemed
greatly
pleased
to
hear
so
directly
from
the
publishers
of
the
missionary
review
and
wished
me
to
make
his
compliments
in
return
his
majesty
then
excused
himself
while
i
talked
with
his
daughter
the
beautiful
a
name
signifying
to
make
the
sea
burn
and
soon
reappeared
in
the
uniform
of
the
german
emperor
william
himself
for
stupidly
enough
i
had
not
sent
my
credentials
ahead
that
the
king
might
be
in
full
regalia
to
receive
me
calling
a
few
days
later
to
say
to
i
saw
king
malietoa
for
the
last
time
of
the
landmarks
in
the
pleasant
town
of
apia
my
memory
rests
first
on
the
little
school
just
back
of
the
london
missionary
society
and
where
bell
taught
english
to
about
a
hundred
native
children
boys
and
girls
brighter
children
you
will
not
find
anywhere
now
children
said
bell
when
i
called
one
day
let
us
show
the
captain
that
we
know
something
about
the
cape
horn
he
passed
in
the
at
which
a
lad
of
nine
or
ten
years
stepped
nimbly
forward
and
read
basil
hall
fine
description
of
the
great
cape
and
read
it
well
he
afterward
copied
the
essay
for
me
in
a
clear
hand
calling
to
say
to
my
friends
at
vailima
i
met
stevenson
in
her
panama
hat
and
went
over
the
estate
with
her
men
were
at
work
clearing
the
land
and
to
one
of
them
she
gave
an
order
to
cut
a
couple
of
for
the
from
a
clump
she
had
planted
four
years
before
and
which
had
grown
to
the
height
of
sixty
feet
i
used
them
for
spare
spars
and
the
butt
of
one
made
a
serviceable
on
the
homeward
voyage
i
had
then
only
to
take
ava
with
the
family
and
be
ready
for
sea
this
ceremony
important
among
samoans
was
conducted
after
the
native
fashion
a
triton
horn
was
sounded
to
let
us
know
when
the
beverage
was
ready
and
in
response
we
all
clapped
hands
the
bout
being
in
honor
of
the
it
was
my
turn
first
after
the
custom
of
the
country
to
spill
a
little
over
my
shoulder
but
having
forgotten
the
samoan
for
let
the
gods
drink
i
repeated
the
equivalent
in
russian
and
chinook
as
i
remembered
a
word
in
each
whereupon
osbourne
pronounced
me
a
confirmed
samoan
then
i
said
tofah
to
my
good
friends
of
samoa
and
all
wishing
the
she
stood
out
of
the
harbor
august
and
continued
on
her
course
a
sense
of
loneliness
seized
upon
me
as
the
islands
faded
astern
and
as
a
remedy
for
it
i
crowded
on
sail
for
lovely
australia
which
was
not
a
strange
land
to
me
but
for
long
days
in
my
dreams
vailima
stood
before
the
prow
the
had
barely
cleared
the
islands
when
a
sudden
burst
of
the
trades
brought
her
down
to
close
reefs
and
she
reeled
off
one
hundred
and
miles
the
first
day
of
which
i
counted
forty
miles
of
current
in
her
favor
finding
a
rough
sea
i
swung
her
off
free
and
sailed
north
of
the
horn
islands
also
north
of
fiji
instead
of
south
as
i
had
intended
and
coasted
down
the
west
side
of
the
archipelago
thence
i
sailed
direct
for
new
south
wales
passing
south
of
new
caledonia
and
arrived
at
newcastle
after
a
passage
of
days
mostly
of
storms
and
gales
one
particularly
severe
gale
encountered
near
new
caledonia
foundered
the
american
farther
south
again
nearer
the
coast
of
australia
when
however
i
was
not
aware
that
the
gale
was
extraordinary
a
french
from
new
caledonia
for
sydney
blown
considerably
out
of
her
course
on
her
arrival
reported
it
an
awful
storm
and
to
inquiring
friends
said
oh
my
we
do
know
what
has
become
of
the
little
sloop
we
saw
her
in
the
thick
of
the
storm
the
was
all
right
lying
to
like
a
duck
she
was
under
a
goose
wing
mainsail
and
had
had
a
dry
deck
while
the
passengers
on
the
steamer
i
heard
later
were
up
to
their
knees
in
water
in
the
saloon
when
their
ship
arrived
at
sydney
they
gave
the
captain
a
purse
of
gold
for
his
skill
and
seamanship
in
bringing
them
safe
into
port
the
captain
of
the
got
nothing
of
this
sort
in
this
gale
i
made
the
land
about
seal
rocks
where
the
steamship
with
many
lives
was
lost
a
short
time
before
i
was
many
hours
off
the
rocks
beating
back
and
forth
but
weathered
them
at
last
i
arrived
at
newcastle
in
the
teeth
of
a
gale
of
wind
it
was
a
stormy
season
the
government
pilot
captain
cumming
met
me
at
the
harbor
bar
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
steamer
carried
my
vessel
to
a
safe
berth
many
visitors
came
on
board
the
first
being
the
united
states
consul
brown
nothing
was
too
good
for
the
here
all
government
dues
were
remitted
and
after
i
had
rested
a
few
days
a
port
pilot
with
a
tug
carried
her
to
sea
again
and
she
made
along
the
coast
toward
the
harbor
of
sydney
where
she
arrived
on
the
following
day
october
i
came
to
in
a
snug
cove
near
manly
for
the
night
the
sydney
harbor
giving
me
a
pluck
into
anchorage
while
they
gathered
data
from
an
old
of
mine
which
seemed
to
interest
them
nothing
escapes
the
vigilance
of
the
new
south
wales
police
their
reputation
is
known
the
world
over
they
made
a
shrewd
guess
that
i
could
give
them
some
useful
information
and
they
were
the
first
to
meet
me
some
one
said
they
came
to
arrest
me
and
well
let
it
go
at
that
illustration
the
accident
at
sydney
summer
was
approaching
and
the
harbor
of
sydney
was
blooming
with
yachts
some
of
them
came
down
to
the
and
sailed
round
her
at
shelcote
where
she
took
a
berth
for
a
few
days
at
sydney
i
was
at
once
among
friends
the
remained
at
the
various
in
the
great
port
for
several
weeks
and
was
visited
by
many
agreeable
people
frequently
by
officers
of
and
their
friends
captain
fisher
the
commander
with
a
party
of
young
ladies
from
the
city
and
gentlemen
belonging
to
his
ship
came
one
day
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
the
midst
of
a
deluge
of
rain
i
never
saw
it
rain
harder
even
in
australia
but
they
were
out
for
fun
and
rain
could
not
dampen
their
feelings
however
hard
it
poured
but
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
a
young
gentleman
of
another
party
on
board
in
the
full
uniform
of
a
very
great
yacht
club
with
brass
buttons
enough
to
sink
him
stepping
quickly
to
get
out
of
the
wet
tumbled
head
and
heels
into
a
barrel
of
water
i
had
been
coopering
and
being
a
short
man
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
nearly
drowned
before
he
was
rescued
it
was
the
nearest
to
a
casualty
on
the
in
her
whole
course
so
far
as
i
know
the
young
man
having
come
on
board
with
compliments
made
the
mishap
most
embarrassing
it
had
been
decided
by
his
club
that
the
could
not
be
officially
recognized
for
the
reason
that
she
brought
no
letters
from
in
america
and
so
i
say
it
seemed
all
the
more
embarrassing
and
strange
that
i
should
have
caught
at
least
one
of
the
members
in
a
barrel
and
too
when
i
was
not
fishing
for
yachtsmen
the
typical
sydney
boat
is
a
handy
sloop
of
great
beam
and
enormous
power
but
a
capsize
is
not
uncommon
for
they
carry
sail
like
vikings
in
sydney
i
saw
all
manner
of
craft
from
the
smart
and
to
the
smaller
sloop
and
canoe
pleasuring
on
the
bay
everybody
owned
a
boat
if
a
boy
in
australia
has
not
the
means
to
buy
him
a
boat
he
builds
one
and
it
is
usually
one
not
to
be
ashamed
of
the
shed
her
joseph
coat
the
fuego
mainsail
in
sydney
and
wearing
a
new
suit
the
handsome
present
of
commodore
foy
she
was
flagship
of
the
johnstone
bay
flying
squadron
when
the
circumnavigators
of
sydney
harbor
sailed
in
their
annual
regatta
they
recognized
the
as
belonging
to
a
club
of
her
own
and
with
more
australian
sentiment
than
fastidiousness
gave
her
credit
for
her
record
time
flew
fast
those
days
in
australia
and
it
was
december
when
the
sailed
from
sydney
my
intention
was
now
to
sail
around
cape
leeuwin
direct
for
mauritius
on
my
way
home
and
so
i
coasted
along
toward
bass
strait
in
that
direction
there
was
little
to
report
on
this
part
of
the
voyage
except
changeable
winds
busters
and
rough
seas
the
of
december
however
was
an
exceptional
day
with
a
fine
coast
wind
northeast
the
early
in
the
morning
passed
twofold
bay
and
later
cape
bundooro
in
a
smooth
sea
with
land
close
aboard
the
lighthouse
on
the
cape
dipped
a
flag
to
the
flag
and
children
on
the
balconies
of
a
cottage
near
the
shore
waved
handkerchiefs
as
she
passed
by
there
were
only
a
few
people
all
told
on
the
shore
but
the
scene
was
a
happy
one
i
saw
festoons
of
evergreen
in
token
of
christmas
near
at
hand
i
saluted
the
merrymakers
wishing
them
a
merry
christmas
and
could
hear
them
say
i
wish
you
the
same
from
cape
bundooro
i
passed
by
cliff
island
in
bass
strait
and
exchanged
signals
with
the
while
the
worked
up
under
the
island
the
wind
howled
that
day
while
the
sea
broke
over
their
rocky
home
a
few
days
later
december
the
came
in
close
under
wilson
promontory
again
seeking
shelter
the
keeper
of
the
light

that
station
clark
came
on
board
and
gave
me
directions
for
waterloo
bay
about
three
miles
to
leeward
for
which
i
bore
up
at
once
finding
good
anchorage
there
in
a
sandy
cove
protected
from
all
westerly
and
northerly
winds
anchored
here
was
the
ketch
a
fisherman
and
the
of
sydney

steam
fitted
for
whaling
the
captain

the

a
genius
and
an
australian
genius
at
that
and
smart
his
crew
from
a
sawmill
up
the
coast
had
not
one
of
them
seen
a
live
whale
when
they
shipped
but
they
were
boatmen
after
an
own
heart
and
the
captain
had
told
them
that
to
kill
a
whale
was
no
more
than
to
kill
a
rabbit
they
believed
him
and
that
settled
it
as
luck
would
have
it
the
very
first
one
they
saw
on
their
cruise
although
an
ugly
humpback
was
a
dead
whale

no
time
captain

master

the
killing

monster

thrust

was
taken
in

for
sydney
where
they
put
it
on
exhibition
nothing
but
whales
interested
the
crew
of
the
gallant
and
they
spent
most
of
their
time
here
gathering
fuel
along
shore
for
a
cruise
on
the
grounds
off
tasmania
whenever
the
word
whale
was
mentioned
in
the
hearing
of
these

glistened

excitement

nearly
a

poked

she
was
charged

this
instance
sixpence

the
gross

collector
exacted
six
shillings
and
sixpence
taking
off
nothing
for
the
fraction
under
thirteen
tons
her
exact
gross
being
tons
i
squared
the
matter
by
charging
people
sixpence
each
for
coming
on
board
and
when
this
business
got
dull
i
caught
a
shark
and
charged
them
sixpence
each
to
look
at
that
the
shark
was
twelve
feet
six
inches
in
length
and
carried
a
progeny
of
not
one
of
them
less
than
two
feet
in
length
a
slit
of
a
knife
let
them
out
in
a
canoe
full
of
water
which
changed
constantly
kept
them
alive

whole
day

less
than
an
hour
from
the
time
i
heard
of
the
ugly
brute
it
was
on
deck
and
on
exhibition
with
rather
more
than
the
amount
of
the
tonnage
dues
already
collected
then
i
hired
a
good
irishman
tom
howard
by
name
who
knew
all
about
sharks
both
on
the
land
and
in
the
sea
and
could
talk
about
them
to
answer
questions
and
lecture
when
i
found
that
i
could
not
keep
abreast
of
the
questions
i
turned
the
responsibility
over
to
him
illustration
the
shark
on
the
deck
of
the
returning
from
the
bank
where
i
had
been
to
deposit
money
early
in
the
day
i
found
howard
in
the
midst
of
a
very
excited
crowd
telling
imaginary
habits
of
the
fish
it
was
a
good
show
the
people
wished
to
see
it
and
it
was
my
wish
that
they
should
but
owing
to
his
enthusiasm
i
was
obliged
to
let
howard
resign
the
income
from
the
show
and
the
proceeds
of
the
tallow
i
had
gathered
in
the
strait
of
magellan
the
last
of
which
i
had
disposed

again
in
tow
of
the
tug
leaving
hobson
bay
after
a
pleasant
time
in
melbourne
and
kilda
which
had
been
protracted
by
a
succession
of
southwest
winds
that
seemed
in
the
summer
months
that
is
december
january
february
and
sometimes
march
east
winds
are
prevalent
through
bass
strait
and
round
cape
leeuwin
but
owing
to
a
vast
amount
of
ice
drifting
up
from
the
antarctic
this
was
all
changed
now
and
emphasized
with
much
bad
weather
so
much
so
that
i
considered
it
impracticable
to
pursue
the
course
farther
therefore
instead
of
thrashing
round
cold
and
stormy
cape
leeuwin
i
decided
to
spend
a
pleasanter
and
more
profitable
time
in
tasmania
waiting
for
the
season
for
favorable
winds
through
torres
strait
by
way
of
the
great
barrier
reef
the
route
i
finally
decided
on
to
sail
this
course
would
be
taking
advantage
of
anticyclones
which
never
fail
and
besides
it
would
give
me
the
chance
to
put
foot
on
the
shores
of
tasmania
round
which
i
had
sailed
years
before
i
should
mention
that
while
i
was
at
melbourne
there
occurred
one
of
those
extraordinary
storms
sometimes
called
rain
of
blood
the
first
of
the
kind
in
many
years
about
australia
the
blood
came
from
a
fine
matter
afloat
in
the
air
from
the
deserts
a
setting
in
brought
down
this
dust
simply
as
mud
it
fell
in
such
quantities
that
a
bucketful
was
collected
from
the
awnings
which
were
spread
at
the
time
when
the
wind
blew
hard
and
i
was
obliged
to
furl
awnings

i
am
indebted
for
the
generous
gift
it
contained
i
could
not
refuse
a
thing
so
kindly
meant
but
promised
myself
to
pass
it
on
with
interest
at
the
first
opportunity
and
this
i
did
before
leaving
australia
the
season
of
fair
weather
around
the
north
of
australia
being
yet
a
long
way
off
i
sailed
to
other
ports
in

where
it
is
fine
the
year
round
the
first
of
these
being
beauty

near
which
are
beaconsfield
and
the

which
i
visited
in

i
saw
much
gray
uninteresting
rock
being
hoisted
out
of
the
mine
there
and
hundreds
of
stamps
crushing
it
into
powder
people
told
me
there
was
gold
in
it
and
i
believed
what
they
said
i
remember
beauty
point
for
its
shady
forest
and
for
the
road
among
the
tall
while
there
the
governor
of
new
south
wales
lord
hampden
and
his
family
came
in
on
a
the
anchored
near
the
threw
her
bunting
out
of
course
and
probably
a
more
insignificant
craft
bearing
the
stars
and
stripes
was
never
seen
in
those
waters
however
the
governor
party
seemed
to
know
why
it
floated
there
and
all
about
the
and
when
i
heard
his
excellency
say
introduce
me
to
the
captain
or
introduce
the
captain
to
me
whichever
it
was
i
found
myself
at
once
in
the
presence
of
a
gentleman
and
a
friend
and
one
greatly
interested
in
my
voyage
if
any
one
of
the
party
was
more
interested
than
the
governor
himself
it
was
the
honorable
margaret
his
daughter
on
leaving
lord
and
lady
hampden
promised
to
rendezvous
with
me
on
board
the

exposition

we
live

said
and

my

the

georgetown
near

tamar
this
little
settlement
i
believe
marks
the
place
where
the
first
footprints
were
made
by
whites
in
tasmania
though
it
never
grew
to
be
more
than
a
hamlet
considering
that
i
had
seen
something
of
the
world
and
finding
people
here
interested
in
adventure
i
talked
the
matter
over

audience

a
little
hall

the
country
road
a

so
my

from

was
a
success
from
this
snug
little
place
i
made
sail
for
devonport
a
thriving
place

the
river

a
few
hours
sail
westward
along
the
coast

the
was
the
first
vessel
to
bring
the
stars
and
stripes
to
the
port
the
captain
murray
told
me
and
so
it
is
written
in
the
port
records
for
the
great
distinction

many
civilities

the

gobbler
was
heard
and
from

up

country
came
an
enormous

illustration
the
in
her
port
duster
at
devonport
tasmania
february
i
was
haunted
by
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
all
about
of
the
natural
ferneries
then
disappearing
and
of
the
domed
on
the
slopes
and
was
fortunate
in
meeting
a
gentleman
intent
on
preserving
in
art
the
beauties
of
his
country
he
presented
me
with
many
reproductions
from
his
collection
of
pictures
also
many
originals
to
show
to
my
friends
by
another
gentleman
i
was
charged
to
tell
the
glories
of
tasmania
in
every
land
and
on
every
occasion
this
was
mccall
the
doctor
gave
me
useful
hints
on
lecturing
it
was
not
without
misgivings
however
that
i
filled
away
on
this
new
course
and
i
am
free
to
say
that
it
is
only
by
the
kindness
of
sympathetic
audiences
that
my
oratorical
bark
was
held
on
even
keel
soon
after
my
first
talk
the
kind
doctor
came
to
me
with
words
of
approval
as
in
many
other
of
my
enterprises
i
had
gone
about
it
at
once
and
without
second
thought
man
man
said
he
great
nervousness
is
only
a
sign
of
brain
and
the
more
brain
a
man
has
the
longer
it
takes
him
to
get
over
the
affliction
but
he
added
reflectively
you
will
get
over
it
however
in
my
own
behalf
i
think
it
only
fair
to
say
that
i
am
not
yet
entirely
cured
the
was
hauled
out
on
the
marine
railway
at
devonport
and
examined
carefully
top
and
bottom
but
was
found
absolutely
free
from
the
destructive
teredo
and
sound
in
all
respects
to
protect
her
further
against
the
ravage
of
these
insects
the
bottom
was
coated
once
more
with
copper
paint
for
she
would
have
to
sail
through
the
coral
and
arafura
seas
before
refitting
again
everything
was
done
to
fit
her
for
all
the
known
dangers
but
it
was
not
without
regret
that
i
looked
forward
to
the
day
of
sailing
from
a
country
of
so
many
pleasant
associations
if
there
was
a
moment
in
my
voyage
when
i
could
have
given
it
up
it
was
there
and
then
but
no
vacancies
for
a
better
post
being
open
i
weighed
anchor
april
and
again
put
to
sea
the
season
of
summer
was
then
over
winter
was
rolling
up
from
the
south
with
fair
winds
for
the
north
a
foretaste
of
winter
wind
sent
the
flying
round
cape
howe
and
as
far
as
cape
bundooro
farther
along
which
she
passed
on
the
following
day
retracing
her
course
northward
this
was
a
fine
run
and
boded
good
for
the
long
voyage
home
from
the
antipodes
my
old
christmas
friends
on
bundooro
seemed
to
be
up
and
moving
when
i
came
the
second
time
by
their
cape
and
we
exchanged
signals
again
while
the
sloop
sailed
along
as
before
in
a
smooth
sea
and
close
to
the
shore
the
weather
was
fine
with
clear
sky
the
rest
of
the
passage
to
port
jackson
sydney
where
the
arrived
april
and
anchored
in
watson
bay
near
the
heads
in
eight
fathoms
of
water
the
harbor
from
the
heads
to
parramatta
up
the
river
was
more
than
ever
alive
with
boats
and
yachts
of
every
class
it
was
indeed
a
scene
of
animation
hardly
equaled
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
a
few
days
later
the
bay
was
flecked
with
tempestuous
waves
and
none
but
stout
ships
carried
sail
i
was
in
a
neighboring
hotel
then
nursing
a
neuralgia
which
i
had
picked
up
alongshore
and
had
only
that
moment
got
a
glance
of
just
the
stern
of
a
large
unmanageable
steamship
passing
the
range
of
my
window
as
she
forged
in
by
the
point
when
the
burst
into
my
room
shouting
that
the
had
gone
bung
i
tumbled
out
quickly
to
learn
that
bung
meant
that
a
large
steamship
had
run
into
her
and
that
it
was
the
one
of
which
i
saw
the
stern
the
other
end
of
her
having
hit
the
it
turned
out
however
that
no
damage
was
done
beyond
the
loss
of
an
anchor
and
chain
which
from
the
shock
of
the
collision
had
parted
at
the
hawse
i
had
nothing
at
all
to
complain
of
though
in
the
end
for
the
captain
after
he
clubbed
his
ship
took
the
in
tow
up
the
harbor
clear
of
all
dangers
and
sent
her
back
again
in
charge
of
an
officer
and
three
men
to
her
anchorage
in
the
bay
with
a
polite
note
saying
he
would
repair
any
damages
done
but
what
yawing
about
she
made
of
it
when
she
came
with
a
stranger
at
the
helm
her
old
friend
the
pilot
of
the
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
such
lubberly
work
but
to
my
great
delight
they
got
her
into
a
berth
and
the
neuralgia
left
me
then
or
was
forgotten
the
captain
of
the
steamer
like
a
true
seaman
kept
his
word
and
his
agent
collishaw
handed
me
on
the
very
next
day
the
price
of
the
lost
anchor
and
chain
with
something
over
for
anxiety
of
mind
i
remember
that
he
offered
me
twelve
pounds
at
once
but
my
lucky
number
being
thirteen
we
made
the
amount
thirteen
pounds
which
squared
all
accounts
i
sailed
again
may
before
a
strong
southwest
wind
which
sent
the
gallantly
on
as
far
as
port
stevens
where
it
fell
calm
and
then
came
up
ahead
but
the
weather
was
fine
and
so
remained
for
many
days
which
was
a
great
change
from
the
state
of
the
weather
experienced
here
some
months
before
having
a
full
set
of
admiralty
of
the
coast
and
barrier
reef
i
felt
easy
in
mind
captain
fisher
who
had
steamed
through
the
barrier
passages
in
advised
me
from
the
first
to
take
this
route
and
i
did
not
regret
coming
back
to
it
now
the
wind
for
a
few
days
after
passing
port
stevens
seal
rocks
and
cape
hawk
was
light
and
dead
ahead
but
these
points
are
photographed
on
my
memory
from
the
trial
of
beating
round
them
some
months
before
when
bound
the
other
way
but
now
with
a
good
stock
of
books
on
board
i
fell
to
reading
day
and
night
leaving
this
pleasant
occupation
merely
to
trim
sails
or
tack
or
to
lie
down
and
rest
while
the
nibbled
at
the
miles
i
tried
to
compare
my
state
with
that
of
old
circumnavigators
who
sailed
exactly
over
the
route
which
i
took
from
cape
verde
islands
or
farther
back
to
this
point
and
beyond
but
there
was
no
comparison
so
far
as
i
had
got
their
hardships
and
romantic
escapes
those
of
them
who
escaped
death
and
worse
sufferings
did
not
enter
into
my
experience
sailing
all
alone
around
the
world
for
me
is
left
to
tell
only
of
pleasant
experiences
till
finally
my
adventures
are
prosy
and
tame
i
had
just
finished
reading
some
of
the
most
interesting
of
the
old
voyages
in
ships
and
was
already
near
port
macquarie
on
my
own
cruise
when
i
made
out
may
a
modern
dandy
craft
in
distress
anchored
on
the
coast
standing
in
for
her
i
found
that
she
was
the
b
which
had
sailed
from
watson
bay
about
three
days
ahead
of
the
and
that
she
had
run
at
once
into
trouble
no
wonder
she
did
so
it
was
a
case
of
babes
in
the
wood
or
butterflies
at
sea
her
owner
on
his
maiden
voyage
was
all
duck
trousers
the
captain
distinguished
for
the
enormous
yachtsman
cap
he
wore
was
a
murrumbidgee
c
whaler
before
he
took
command
of
the
and
the
navigating
officer
poor
fellow
was
almost
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
nearly
as
stiff
and
immovable
as
a
post
in
the
ground
these
three
jolly
tars
comprised
the
crew
none
of
them
knew
more
about
the
sea
or
about
a
vessel
than
a
newly
born
babe
knows
about
another
world
they
were
bound
for
new
guinea
so
they
said
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
three
tenderfeet
so
tender
as
those
never
reached
that
destination
b
was
not
her
registered
name
which
need
not
be
told
c
the
murrumbidgee
is
a
small
river
winding
among
the
mountains
of
australia
and
would
be
the
last
place
in
which
to
look
for
a
whale
the
owner
whom
i
had
met
before
he
sailed
wanted
to
race
the
poor
old
to
thursday
island
en
route
i
declined
the
challenge
naturally
on
the
ground
of
the
unfairness
of
three
young
yachtsmen
in
a
clipper
against
an
old
sailor
all
alone
in
a
craft
of
coarse
build
besides
that
i
would
not
on
any
account
race
in
the
coral
sea
illustration
it
to
blow
ahoy
they
all
hailed
now
what
the
weather
goin
t
be
is
it
to
blow
and
do
you
think
we
better
go
back
i
thought
if
ever
you
get
back
do
refit
but
i
said
give
me
the
end
of
a
rope
and
i
tow
you
into
yon
port
farther
along
and
on
your
lives
i
urged
do
not
go
back
round
cape
hawk
for
winter
to
the
south
of
it
they
purposed
making
for
newcastle
under
for
their
mainsail
had
been
blown
to
ribbons
even
the
jigger
had
been
blown
away
and
her
rigging
flew
at
loose
ends
the
in
a
word
was
a
wreck
up
anchor
i
shouted
up
anchor
and
let
me
tow
you
into
port
macquarie
twelve
miles
north
of
this
no
cried
the
owner
we
go
back
to
newcastle
we
missed
newcastle
on
the
way
coming
we
did
see
the
light
and
it
was
not
thick
either
this
he
shouted
very
loud
ostensibly
for
my
hearing
but
closer
even
than
necessary
i
thought
to
the
ear
of
the
navigating
officer
again
i
tried
to
persuade
them
to
be
towed
into
the
port
of
refuge
so
near
at
hand
it
would
have
cost
them
only
the
trouble
of
weighing
their
anchor
and
passing
me
a
rope
of
this
i
assured
them
but
they
declined
even
this
in
sheer
ignorance
of
a
rational
course
what
is
your
depth
of
water
i
asked
do
know
we
lost
our
lead
all
the
chain
is
out
we
sounded
with
the
anchor
send
your
dinghy
over
and
i
give
you
a
lead
we
lost
our
dinghy
too
they
cried
god
is
good
else
you
would
have
lost
yourselves
and
farewell
was
all
i
could
say
the
trifling
service
proffered
by
the
would
have
saved
their
vessel
report
us
they
cried
as
i
stood
on
report
us
with
sails
blown
away
and
that
we
do
care
a
dash
and
are
not
afraid
then
there
is
no
hope
for
you
and
again
farewell
i
promised
i
would
report
them
and
did
so
at
the
first
opportunity
and
out
of
humane
reasons
i
do
so
again
on
the
following
day
i
spoke
the
steamship
bound
down
the
coast
and
reported
the
yacht
in
distress
and
that
it
would
be
an
act
of
humanity
to
tow
her
somewhere
away
from
her
exposed
position
on
an
open
coast
that
she
did
not
get
a
tow
from
the
steamer
was
from
no
lack
of
funds
to
pay
the
bill
for
the
owner
lately
heir
to
a
few
hundred
pounds
had
the
money
with
him
the
proposed
voyage
to
new
guinea
was
to
look
that
island
over
with
a
view
to
its
purchase
it
was
about
eighteen
days
before
i
heard
of
the
again
which
was
on
the
of
may
when
i
reached
cooktown
on
the
endeavor
river
where
i
found
this
news
may
the
yacht
from
sydney
for
new
guinea
three
hands
on
board
lost
at
crescent
head
the
crew
saved
so
it
took
them
several
days
to
lose
the
yacht
after
all
after
speaking
the
distressed
and
the
the
voyage
for
many
days
was
uneventful
save
in
the
pleasant
incident
on
may
of
a
chat
by
signal
with
the
people
on
south
solitary
island
a
dreary
stone
heap
in
the
ocean
just
off
the
coast
of
new
south
wales
in
latitude
degrees
south
what
vessel
is
that
they
asked
as
the
sloop
came
abreast
of
their
island
for
answer
i
tried
them
with
the
stars
and
stripes
at
the
peak
down
came
their
signals
at
once
and
up
went
the
british
ensign
instead
which
they
dipped
heartily
i
understood
from
this
that
they
made
out
my
vessel
and
knew
all
about
her
for
they
asked
no
more
questions
they
did
even
ask
if
the
voyage
would
pay
but
they
threw
out
this
friendly
message
wishing
you
a
pleasant
voyage
which
at
that
very
moment
i
was
having
may
the
passing
the
tweed
river
was
signaled
from
danger
point
where
those
on
shore
seemed
most
anxious
about
the
state
of
my
health
for
they
asked
if
all
hands
were
well
to
which
i
could
say
yes
on
the
following
day
the
rounded
great
sandy
cape
and
what
is
a
notable
event
in
every
voyage
picked
up
the
and
these
winds
followed
her
now
for
many
thousands
of
miles
never
ceasing
to
blow
from
a
moderate
gale
to
a
mild
summer
breeze
except
at
rare
intervals
from
the
pitch
of
the
cape
was
a
noble
light
seen
miles
passing
from
this
to
lady
elliott
light
which
stands
on
an
island
as
a
sentinel
at
the
gateway
of
the
barrier
reef
the
was
at
once
in
the
fairway
leading
north
poets
have
sung
of
and
of
pharos
but
did
ever
poet
behold
a
great
light
flash
up
before
his
path
on
a
dark
night
in
the
midst
of
a
coral
sea
if
so
he
knew
the
meaning
of
his
song
the
had
sailed
for
hours
in
suspense
evidently
stemming
a
current
almost
mad
with
doubt
i
grasped
the
helm
to
throw
her
head
off
shore
when
blazing
out
of
the
sea
was
the
light
ahead
excalibur
cried
all
hands
and
rejoiced
and
sailed
on
the
was
now
in
a
protected
sea
and
smooth
water
the
first
she
had
dipped
her
keel
into
since
leaving
gibraltar
and
a
change
it
was
from
the
heaving
of
the
misnamed
pacific
ocean
the
pacific
is
perhaps
upon
the
whole
no
more
boisterous
than
other
oceans
though
i
feel
quite
safe
in
saying
that
it
is
not
more
pacific
except
in
name
it
is
often
wild
enough
in
one
part
or
another
i
once
knew
a
writer
who
after
saying
beautiful
things
about
the
sea
passed
through
a
pacific
hurricane
and

man
but
where
after
all
would
be

of
the
sea
were
there
no
wild

at
last
here
was
the
in
the

a
sea
of
coral
the
sea
itself
might
be
called
smooth
indeed
but
coral
rocks
are
always
rough
sharp
and
dangerous
i
trusted
now
to
the
mercies
of
the
maker
of
all
reefs
keeping
a
good
lookout
at
the

time
for
perils
on

it
was
quiet
in

when
the
arrived
and
the
good
people
with
an
hour
to
throw
away
on
the
second
evening
of
her
arrival
came
down
to
the
school
of
arts
to
talk
about
the
voyage
it
being
the
latest
event
it
was
duly
advertised
in
the
two
little
papers
boomerang
and
nully
nully
in
the
one
the
day
before
the
affair
came
off
and
in
the
other
the
day
after
which
was
all
the
same
to
the
editor
and
for
that
matter
it
was
the
same
to
me
besides
this
circulars
were
distributed
with
a
flourish
and
the
best
bellman
in
australia
was
employed
but
i
could
have
keelhauled
the
wretch
bell
and
all
when
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
little
hotel
where
my
prospective
audience
and
i
were
dining
and
with
his
clattering
bell
and
fiendish
yell
made
noises
that
would
awake
the
dead
all
over
the
voyage
of
the
from
boston
to
bowen
the
two
hubs
in
the
of
creation
as
the
boomerang
afterward
said
myles
magistrate
land
commissioner
gold
warden
was
chairman
and
introduced
me
for
what
reason
i
never
knew
except
to
embarrass
me
with
a
sense
of
vain
ostentation
and
embitter
my
life
for
heaven
knows
i
had
met
every
person
in
town
the
first
hour
ashore
i
knew
them
all
by
name
now
and
they
all
knew
me
however
myles
was
a
good
talker
indeed
i
tried
to
induce
him
to
go
on
and
tell
the
story
while
i
showed
the
pictures
but
this
he
refused
to
do
i
may
explain
that
it
was
a
talk
illustrated
by
stereopticon
the
views
were
good
but
the
lantern
a
affair
was
wretched
and
had
only
an
in
it
i
sailed
early
the
next
morning
before
the
papers
came
out
thinking
it
best
to
do
so
they
each
appeared
with
a
favorable
column
however
of
what
they
called
a
lecture
so
i
learned
afterward
and
they
had
a
kind
word
for
the
bellman
besides
from
port
denison
the
sloop
ran
before
the
constant
and
made
no
stop
at
all
night
or
day
till
she
reached
cooktown
on
the
endeavor
river
where
she
arrived
monday
may
before
a
furious
blast
of
wind
encountered
that
day
fifty
miles
down
the
coast
on
this
parallel
of
latitude
is
the
high
ridge
and
backbone
of
the
tradewinds
which
about
cooktown
amount
often
to
a
hard
gale
i
had
been
charged
to
navigate
the
route
with
extra
care
and
to
feel
my
way
over
the
ground
the
skilled
officer
of
the
royal
navy
who
advised
me
to
take
the
barrier
reef
passage
wrote
me
that
steamed
nights
as
well
as
days
through
it
but
that
i
under
sail
would
jeopardize
my
vessel
on
coral
reefs
if
i
undertook
to
do
so
confidentially
it
would
have
been
no
easy
matter
finding
anchorage
every
night
the
hard
work
too
of
getting
the
sloop
under
way
every
morning
was
finished
i
had
hoped
when
she
cleared
the
strait
of
magellan
besides
that
the
best
of
admiralty
charts
made
it
possible
to
keep
on
sailing
night
and
day
indeed
with
a
fair
wind
and
in
the
clear
weather
of
that
season
the
way
through
the
barrier
reef
channel
in
all
sincerity
was
clearer
than
a
highway
in
a
busy
city
and
by
all
odds
less
dangerous
but
to
any
one
contemplating
the
voyage
i
would
say
beware
of
reefs
day
or
night
or
remaining
on
the
land
be
wary
still
the
came
flying
into
port
like
a
bird
said
the
longshore
daily
papers
of
cooktown
the
morning
after
she
arrived
and
it
seemed
strange
they
added
that
only
one
man
could
be
seen
on
board
working
the
craft
the
was
doing
her
best
to
be
sure
for
it
was
near
night
and
she
was
in
haste
to
find
a
perch
before
dark
illustration
the
leaving
sydney
australia
in
the
new
suit
of
sails
given
by
commodore
foy
of
australia
from
a
photograph
tacking
inside
of
all
the
craft
in
port
i
moored
her
at
sunset
nearly
abreast
the
captain
cook
monument
and
next
morning
went
ashore
to
feast
my
eyes
on
the
very
stones
the
great
navigator
had
seen
for
i
was
now
on
a
seaman
consecrated
ground
but
there
seemed
a
question
in
cooktown
mind
as
to
the
exact
spot
where
his
ship
the
hove
down
for
repairs
on
her
memorable
voyage
around
the
world
some
said
it
was
not
at
all
at
the
place
where
the
monument
now
stood
a
discussion
of
the
subject
was
going
on
one
morning
where
i
happened
to
be
and
a
young
lady
present
turning
to
me
as
one
of
some
authority
in
nautical
matters
very
flatteringly
asked
my
opinion
well
i
could
see
no
reason
why
captain
cook
if
he
made
up
his
mind
to
repair
his
ship
inland
could
have
dredged
out
a
channel
to
the
place
where
the
monument
now
stood
if
he
had
a
with
him
and
afterward
fill
it
up
again
for
captain
cook
could
do
anything
and
nobody
ever
said
that
he
had
a
dredger
along
the
young
lady
seemed
to
lean
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
following
up
the
story
of
the
historical
voyage
asked
if
i
had
visited
the
point
farther
down
the
harbor
where
the
great
circumnavigator
was
murdered
this
took
my
breath
but
a
bright
coming
along
relieved
my
embarrassment
for
like
all
boys
seeing
that
information
was
wanted
he
volunteered
to
supply
it
said
he
captain
cook
was
murdered
at
all
was
killed
in
hafrica
a
lion
et
here
i
was
reminded
of
distressful
days
gone
by
i
think
it
was
in
that
the
old
steamship
from
batavia
for
sydney
put
in
at
cooktown
for
as
i
always
thought
and
incidentally
to
land
mails
on
her
was
my
fevered
self
and
so
i
see
the
place
till
i
came
back
on
the
years
later
and
now
i
saw
coming
into
port
the
physical
wrecks
of
miners
from
new
guinea
destitute
and
dying
many
had
died
on
the
way
and
had
been
buried
at
sea
he
would
have
been
a
hardened
wretch
who
could
look
on
and
not
try
to
do
something
for
them
the
sympathy
of
all
went
out
to
these
sufferers
but
the
little
town
was
already
straitened
from
a
long
run
on
its
benevolence
i
thought
of
the
matter
of
the
lady
gift
to
me
at
tasmania
which
i
had
promised
myself
i
would
keep
only
as
a
loan
but
found
now
to
my
embarrassment
that
i
had
invested
the
money
however
the
good
cooktown
people
wished
to
hear
a
story
of
the
sea
and
how
the
crew
of
the
fared
when
illness
got
aboard
of
her
accordingly
the
little
presbyterian
church
on
the
hill
was
opened
for
a
conversation
everybody
talked
and
they
made
a
roaring
success
of
it
judge
chester
the
magistrate
was
at
the
head
of
the
gam
and
so
it
was
bound
to
succeed
he
it
was
who
annexed
the
island
of
new
guinea
to
great
britain
while
i
was
about
it
said
he
i
annexed
the
blooming
lot
of
it
there
was
a
ring
in
the
statement
pleasant
to
the
ear
of
an
old
voyager
however
the
germans
made
such
a
row
over
the
judge
mainsail
haul
that
they
got
a
share
in
the
venture
well
i
was
now
indebted
to
the
miners
of
cooktown
for
the
great
privilege
of
adding
a
mite
to
a
worthy
cause
and
to
judge
chester
all
the
town
was
indebted
for
a
general
good
time
the
matter
standing
so
i
sailed
on
june
heading
away
for
the
north
as
before
arrived
at
a
very
inviting
anchorage
about
sundown
the
i
came
to
for
the
night
abreast
the
claremont
this
was
the
only
time
throughout
the
passage
of
the
barrier
reef
channel
that
the
anchored
except
at
port
denison
and
at
endeavor
river
on
the
very
night
following
this
however
the
i
regretted
keenly
for
an
instant
that
i
had
not
anchored
before
dark
as
i
might
have
done
easily
under
the
lee
of
a
coral
reef
it
happened
in
this
way
the
had
just
passed
m
reef
and
left
the
light
dipping
astern
when
going
at
full
speed
with
sheets
off
she
hit
the
m
reef
itself
on
the
north
end
where
i
expected
to
see
a
beacon
she
swung
off
quickly
on
her
heel
however
and
with
one
more
bound
on
a
swell
cut
across
the
shoal
point
so
quickly
that
i
hardly
knew
how
it
was
done
the
beacon
was
there
at
least
i
did
see
it
i
had
time
to
look
for
it
after
she
struck
and
certainly
it
much
matter
then
whether
i
saw
it
or
not
but
this
gave
her
a
fine
departure
for
cape
greenville
the
next
point
ahead
i
saw
the
ugly
boulders
under
the
sloop
keel
as
she
flashed
over
them
and
i
made
a
mental
note
of
it
that
the
letter
m
for
which
the
reef
was
named
was
the
thirteenth
one
in
our
alphabet
and
that
thirteen
as
noted
years
before
was
still
my
lucky
number
the
natives
of
cape
greenville
are
notoriously
bad
and
i
was
advised
to
give
them
the
accordingly
from
m
reef
i
steered
outside
of
the
adjacent
islands
to
be
on
the
safe
side
skipping
along
now
the
passed
home
island
off
the
pitch
of
the
cape
soon
after
midnight
and
squared
away
on
a
westerly
course
a
short
time
later
she
fell
in
with
a
steamer
bound
south
groping
her
way
in
the
dark
and
making
the
night
dismal
with
her
own
black
smoke
from
home
island
i
made
for
sunday
island
and
bringing
that
abeam
shortened
sail
not
wishing
to
make
bird
island
farther
along
before
daylight
the
wind
being
still
fresh
and
the
islands
being
low
with
dangers
about
them
wednesday
june
at
daylight
bird
island
was
dead
ahead
distant
two
and
a
half
miles
which
i
considered
near
enough
a
strong
current
was
pressing
the
sloop
forward
i
did
not
shorten
sail
too
soon
in
the
night
the
first
and
only
australian
canoe
seen
on
the
voyage
was
encountered
here
standing
from
the
mainland
with
a
rag
of
sail
set
bound
for
this
island
a
long
slim
fish
that
leaped
on
board
in
the
night
was
found
on
deck
this
morning
i
had
it
for
breakfast
the
spry
chap
was
no
larger
around
than
a
herring
which
it
resembled
in
every
respect
except
that
it
was
three
times
as
long
but
that
was
so
much
the
better
for
i
am
rather
fond
of
fresh
herring
anyway
a
great
number
of
were
about
this
day
which
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
on
god
earth
the
dancing
over
the
waves
entered
albany
pass
as
the
sun
drew
low
in
the
west
over
the
hills
of
australia
at
the
now
through
the
pass
came
to
anchor
in
a
cove
in
the
mainland
near
a
called
the
which
was
at
anchor
her
captain
from
the
deck
of
his
vessel
directing
me
to
a
berth
this
done
he
at
once
came
on
board
to
clasp
hands
the
was
a
californian
and
captain
jones
her
master
was
an
american
on
the
following
morning
captain
jones
brought
on
board
two
pairs
of
exquisite
pearl
shells
the
most
perfect
ones
i
ever
saw
they
were
probably
the
best
he
had
for
jones
was
the
of
a
sailor
he
assured
me
that
if
i
would
remain
a
few
hours
longer
some
friends
from
somerset
near
by
would
pay
us
all
a
visit
and
one
of
the
crew
sorting
shells
on
deck
guessed
they
would
the
mate
guessed
so
too
the
friends
came
as
even
the
second
mate
and
cook
had
guessed
they
would
they
were
jardine
stockman
famous
throughout
the
land
and
his
family
jardine
was
the
niece
of
king
malietoa
and
cousin
to
the
beautiful
to
make
the
sea
burn
who
visited
the
at
apia
jardine
was
himself
a
fine
specimen
of
a
scotsman
with
his
little
family
about
him
he
was
content
to
live
in
this
remote
place
accumulating
the
comforts
of
life
the
fact
of
the
having
been
built
in
america
accounted
for
the
crew
boy
jim
and
all
being
such
good
guessers
strangely
enough
though
captain
jones
himself
the
only
american
aboard
was
never
heard
to
guess
at
all
after
a
pleasant
chat
and
to
the
people
of
the
and
to
and
jardine
i
again
weighed
anchor
and
stood
across
for
thursday
island
now
in
plain
view
in
torres
strait
where
i
arrived
shortly
after
noon
here
the
remained
over
until
june
being
the
only
american
representative
in
port
this
tarry
was
imperative
for
on
the
was
the
queen
diamond
jubilee
the
two
days
over
were
as
sailors
say
for
coming
up
meanwhile
i
spent
pleasant
days
about
the
island
douglas
resident
magistrate
invited
me
on
a
cruise
in
his
steamer
one
day
among
the
islands
in
torres
strait
this
being
a
scientific
expedition
in
charge
of
professor
mason
bailey
botanist
we
rambled
over
friday
and
saturday
islands
where
i
got
a
glimpse
of
botany
miss
bailey
the
professor
daughter
accompanied
the
expedition
and
told
me
of
many
indigenous
plants
with
long
names
the
was
the
great
day
on
thursday
island
for
then
we
had
not
only
the
jubilee
but
a
jubilee
with
a
grand
corroboree
in
it
douglas
having
brought
some
four
hundred
native
warriors
and
their
wives
and
children
across
from
the
mainland
to
give
the
celebration
the
true
native
touch
for
when
they
do
a
thing
on
thursday
island
they
do
it
with
a
roar
the
corroboree
was
at
any
rate
a
howling
success
it
took
place
at
night
and
the
performers
painted
in
fantastic
colors
danced
or
leaped
about
before
a
blazing
fire
some
were
rigged
and
painted
like
birds
and
beasts
in
which
the
emu
and
kangaroo
were
well
represented
one
fellow
leaped
like
a
frog
some
had
the
human
skeleton
painted
on
their
bodies
while
they
jumped
about
threateningly
spear
in
hand
ready
to
strike
down
some
imaginary
enemy
the
kangaroo
hopped
and
danced
with
natural
ease
and
grace
making
a
fine
figure
all
kept
time
to
music
vocal
and
instrumental
the
instruments
save
the
mark
being
bits
of
wood
which
they
beat
one
against
the
other
and
bones
held
in
the
palm
of
the
hands
which
they
knocked
together
making
a
dull
sound
it
was
a
show
at
once
amusing
spectacular
and
hideous
the
warrior
aborigines
that
i
saw
in
queensland
were
for
the
most
part
lithe
and
fairly
well
built
but
they
were
stamped
always
with
repulsive
features
and
their
women
were
if
possible
still
more
ill
favored
i
observed
that
on
the
day
of
the
jubilee
no
foreign
flag
was
waving
in
the
public
grounds
except
the
stars
and
stripes
which
along
with
the
union
jack
guarded
the
gateway
and
floated
in
many
places
from
the
tiniest
to
the
standard
size
speaking
to
douglas
i
ventured
a
remark
on
this
compliment
to
my
country
oh
said
he
this
is
a
family
affair
and
we
do
not
consider
the
stars
and
stripes
a
foreign
flag
the
of
course
flew
her
best
bunting
and
hoisted
the
jack
as
well
as
her
own
noble
flag
as
high
as
she
could
on
june
the
well
fitted
in
every
way
sailed
for
the
long
voyage
ahead
down
the
indian
ocean
douglas
gave
her
a
flag
as
she
was
leaving
his
island
the
had
now
passed
nearly
all
the
dangers
of
the
coral
sea
and
torres
strait
which
indeed
were
not
a
few
and
all
ahead
from
this
point
was
plain
sailing
and
a
straight
course
the
was
still
blowing
fresh
and
could
be
safely
counted
on
now
down
to
the
coast
of
madagascar
if
not
beyond
that
for
it
was
still
early
in
the
season
i
had
no
wish
to
arrive
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
before
midsummer
and
it
was
now
early
winter
i
had
been
off
that
cape
once
in
july
which
was
of
course
midwinter
there
the
stout
ship
i
then
commanded
encountered
only
fierce
hurricanes
and
she
bore
them
ill
i
wished
for
no
winter
gales
now
it
was
not
that
i
feared
them
more
being
in
the
instead
of
a
large
ship
but
that
i
preferred
fine
weather
in
any
case
it
is
true
that
one
may
encounter
heavy
gales
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
at
any
season
of
the
year
but
in
the
summer
they
are
less
frequent
and
do
not
continue
so
long
and
so
with
time
enough
before
me
to
admit
of
a
run
ashore
on
the
islands
en
route
i
shaped
the
course
now
for
keeling
cocos
atoll
islands
distant
hundred
miles
taking
a
departure
from
booby
island
which
the
sloop
passed
early
in
the
day
i
decided
to
sight
timor
on
the
way
an
island
of
high
mountains
booby
island
i
had
seen
before
but
only
once
however
and
that
was
when
in
the
steamship
on
which
i
was
in
a
fever
when
she
steamed
along
this
way
i
was
well
enough
to
crawl
on
deck
to
look
at
booby
island
had
i
died
for
it
i
would
have
seen
that
island
in
those
days
passing
ships
landed
stores
in
a
cave
on
the
island
for
shipwrecked
and
distressed
wayfarers
captain
airy
of
the
a
good
man
sent
a
boat
to
the
cave
with
his
contribution
to
the
general
store
the
stores
were
landed
in
safety
and
the
boat
returning
brought
back
from
the
improvised
there
a
dozen
or
more
letters
most
of
them
left
by
whalemen
with
the
request
that
the
first
ship
would
carry
them
along
and
see
to
their
mailing
which
had
been
the
custom
of
this
strange
postal
service
for
many
years
some
of
the
letters
brought
back
by
our
boat
were
directed
to
new
bedford
and
some
to
fairhaven
massachusetts
there
is
a
light
on
booby
island
and
regular
packet
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
the
beautiful
uncertainty
of
the
fate
of
letters
left
there
is
a
thing
of
the
past
i
made
no
call
at
the
little
island
but
standing
close
in
exchanged
signals
with
the
keeper
of
the
light
sailing
on
the
sloop
was
at
once
in
the
arafura
sea
where
for
days
she
sailed
in
water
milky
white
and
green
and
purple
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
enter
the
sea
on
the
last
quarter
of
the
moon
the
advantage
being
that
in
the
dark
nights
i
witnessed
the
phosphorescent
light
effect
at
night
in
its
greatest
splendor
the
sea
where
the
sloop
disturbed
it
seemed
all
ablaze
so
that
by
its
light
i
could
see
the
smallest
articles
on
deck
and
her
wake
was
a
path
of
fire
on
the
of
june
the
sloop
was
already
clear
of
all
the
shoals
and
dangers
and
was
sailing
on
a
smooth
sea
as
steadily
as
before
but
with
speed
somewhat
slackened
i
got
out
the
made
at
juan
fernandez
and
set
it
as
a
spinnaker
from
the
stoutest
bamboo
that
stevenson
had
given
me
at
samoa
the
spinnaker
pulled
like
a
sodger
and
the
bamboo
holding
its
own
the
mended
her
pace
several
pigeons
flying
across
from
australia
toward
the
islands
bent
their
course
over
the
smaller
birds
were
seen
flying
in
the
opposite
direction
in
the
part
of
the
arafura
that
i
came
to
first
where
it
was
shallow
writhed
about
on
the
surface
and
tumbled
over
and
over
in
the
waves
as
the
sloop
sailed
farther
on
where
the
sea
became
deep
they
disappeared
in
the
ocean
where
the
water
is
blue
not
one
was
ever
seen
in
the
days
of
serene
weather
there
was
not
much
to
do
but
to
read
and
take
rest
on
the
to
make
up
as
much
as
possible
for
the
rough
time
off
cape
horn
which
was
not
yet
forgotten
and
to
forestall
the
cape
of
good
hope
by
a
store
of
ease
my
sea
journal
was
now
much
the
same
from
day
to
like
this
of
june
and
for
example
june
in
the
morning
it
is
a
bit
squally
later
in
the
day

as

on
the

there
was
much
in
that
log
i
sure
june
makes
a
better
showing

all
is
told
first

all

it
go

at

degrees
for
several
days
now
the
sailed
west
on
the
parallel
of
degrees
as
true
as
a
hair
if
she
deviated
at
all
from
that
through
the
day
or
night
and
this
may
have
happened
she
was
back
strangely
enough
at
noon
at
the
same
latitude
but
the
greatest
science
was
in
reckoning
the
longitude
my
tin
clock
and
only
timepiece
had
by
this
time
lost
its
but
after
i
boiled
her
she
told
the
hours
and
that
was
near
enough
on
a
long
stretch
on
the
of
july
the
great
island
of
timor
was
in
view
away
to
the
on
the
following
day
i
saw
dana
island
not
far
off
and
a
breeze
came
up
from
the
land
at
night
fragrant
of
the
spices
or
what
not
of
the
coast
on
the
with
all
sail
set
and
with
the
spinnaker
still
abroad
christmas
island
about
noon
came
into
view
one
point
on
the
starboard
bow
before
night
it
was
abeam
and
distant
two
and
a
half
miles
the
surface
of
the
island
appeared
evenly
rounded
from
the
sea
to
a
considerable
height
in
the
center
in
outline
it
was
as
smooth
as
a
fish
and
a
long
ocean
swell
rolling
up
broke
against
the
sides
where
it
lay
like
a
monster
asleep
motionless
on
the
sea
it
seemed
to
have
the
proportions
of
a
whale
and
as
the
sloop
sailed
along
its
side
to
the
part
where
the
head
would
be
there
was
a
nostril
even
which
was
a
through
a
ledge
of
rock
where
every
wave
that
dashed
threw
up
a
shaft
of
water
lifelike
and
real
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
i
last
saw
this
island
but
i
remember
my
temporary
admiration
for
the
captain
of
the
ship
i
was
then
in
the
when
he
sang
out
one
morning
from
the
well
aft
go
aloft
there
one
of
ye
with
a
pair
of
eyes
and
see
christmas
island
sure
enough
there
the
island
was
in
sight
from
the
captain
m
had
thus
made
a
great
hit
and
he
never
got
over
it
the
chief
mate
terror
of
us
ordinaries
in
the
ship
walking
never
to
windward
of
the
captain
now
took
himself
very
humbly
to
leeward
altogether
when
we
arrived
at
there
was
a
letter
in
the
ship
mail
for
me
i
was
in
the
boat
with
the
captain
some
hours
while
he
had
it
but
do
you
suppose
he
could
hand
a
letter
to
a
seaman
no
indeed
not
even
to
an
ordinary
seaman
when
we
got
to
the
ship
he
gave
it
to
the
first
mate
the
first
mate
gave
it
to
the
second
mate
and
he
laid
it
michingly

the
where
i
could

a

a

in

to

cocos
islands
was
now
only
five
hundred
and
fifty
miles
but
even
in
this
short
run
it
was
necessary
to
be
extremely
careful
in
keeping
a
true
course
else
i
would
miss
the
atoll
on
the
some
hundred
miles
southwest
of
christmas
island
i
saw
clouds
flying
up
from
the
southwest
very
high
over
the
regular
winds
which
weakened
now
for
a
few
days
while
a
swell
heavier
than
usual
set
in
also
from
the
southwest
a
winter
gale
was
going
on
in
the
direction
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
accordingly
i
steered
higher
to
windward
allowing
twenty
miles
a
day
while
this
went
on
for
change
of
current
and
it
was
not
too
much
for
on
that
course
i
made
the
keeling
islands
right
ahead
the
first
unmistakable
sign
of
the
land
was
a
visit
one
morning
from
a
white
tern
that
fluttered
very
knowingly
about
the
vessel
and
then
took
itself
off
westward
with
a
businesslike
air
in
its
wing
the
tern
is
called
by
the
islanders
the
pilot
of
keeling
cocos
farther
on
i
came
among
a
great
number
of
birds
fishing
and
fighting
over
whatever
they
caught
my
reckoning
was
up
and
springing
aloft
i
saw
from
up
the
mast
standing
out
of
the
water
ahead
i
expected
to
see
this
still
it
thrilled
me
as
an
electric
shock
might
have
done
i
slid
down
the
mast
trembling
under
the
strangest
sensations
and
not
able
to
resist
the
impulse
i
sat
on
deck
and
gave
way
to
my
emotions
to
folks
in
a
parlor
on
shore
this
may
seem
weak
indeed
but
i
am
telling
the
story
of
a
voyage
alone
i
did
touch
the
helm
for
with
the
current
and
heave
of
the
sea
the
sloop
found
herself
at
the
end
of
the
run
absolutely
in
the
fairway
of
the
channel
you
could
have
beaten
it
in
the
navy
then
i
trimmed
her
sails
by
the
wind
took
the
helm
and
flogged
her
up
the
couple
of
miles
or
so
abreast
the
harbor
landing
where
i
cast
anchor
at
july
days
from
thursday
island
the
distance
run
was
hundred
miles
as
the
crow
flies
this
would
have
been
a
fair
atlantic
voyage
it
was
a
delightful
sail
during
those
days
i
had
not
spent
altogether
more
than
three
hours
at
the
helm
including
the
time
occupied
in
beating
into
keeling
harbor
i
just
lashed
the
helm
and
let
her
go
whether
the
wind
was
abeam
or
dead
aft
it
was
all
the
same
she
always
sailed
on
her
course
no
part
of
the
voyage
up
to
this
point
taking
it
by
and
large
had
been
so
finished
as
this

d
andrew
leach
reporting
july
through

kynnersley
of

to
joseph
chamberlain
colonial
secretary
said
concerning
the
visit
to
the
atoll
as
we
left
the
ocean
depths
of
deepest
blue
and
entered
the
coral
circle
the
contrast
was
most
remarkable
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
waters
transparent
to
a
depth
of
over
thirty
feet
now
purple
now
of
the
bluest
and
now
green
with
the
white
crests
of
the
waves
flashing
tinder
a
brilliant
sun
the
encircling
islands
the
gaps
between
which
were
to
the
south
undiscernible
the
white
sand
shores
and
the
whiter
gaps
where
breakers
appeared
and
lastly
the
lagoon
itself
seven
or
eight
miles
across
from
north
to
south
and
five
to
six
from
east
to
west
presented
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
after
some
little
delay
sidney
ross
the
eldest
son
of
george
ross
came
off
to
meet
us
and
soon
after
accompanied
by
the
doctor
and
another
officer
we
went
ashore
on
reaching
the
we
found
hauled
up
for
cleaning
the

yawl
of

the
property
of

joshua
slocum
he
arrived

on
the
of

days
out
from

this
extraordinary
solitary
traveler
left
boston
some
two
years
ago
crossed
to
gibraltar
sailed
down
to
cape

passed
through
the

of

to
the
society
islands
thence
to

and
through
the
torres
strait
to
thursday
island
the
keeling
cocos
islands
according
to
admiral
fitzroy
lie
between
the
latitudes
of
degrees
and
degrees
and
the
longitudes
of
degrees
and
degrees
they
were
discovered
in
by
captain
william
keeling
then
in
the
service
of
the
east
india
company
the
southern
group
consists
of
seven
or
eight
islands
and
islets
on
the
atoll
which
is
the
skeleton
of
what
some
day
according
to
the
history
of
coral
reefs
will
be
a
continuous
island
north
keeling
has
no
harbor
is
seldom
visited
and
is
of
no
importance
the
south
keelings
are
a
strange
little
world
with
a
romantic
history
all
their
own
they
have
been
visited
occasionally
by
the
floating
spar
of
some
ship
or
by
a
tree
that
has
drifted
all
the
way
from
australia
or
by
an
ship
cast
away
and
finally
by
man
even
a
rock
once
drifted
to
keeling
held
fast
among
the
roots
of
a
tree
after
the
discovery
of
the
islands
by
captain
keeling
their
first
notable
visitor
was
captain
john
who
in
touched
in
the
ship
on
a
voyage
to
india
captain
ross
returned
two
years
later
with
his
wife
and
family
and
his
dymoke
and
eight
to
take
possession
of
the
islands
but
found
there
already
one
alexander
hare
who
meanwhile
had
marked
the
little
atoll
as
a
sort
of
eden
for
a
seraglio
of
malay
women
which
he
moved
over
from
the
coast
of
africa
it
was
ross
own
brother
oddly
enough
who
freighted
hare
and
his
crowd
of
women
to
the
islands
not
knowing
of
captain
john
plans
to
occupy
the
little
world
and
so
hare
was
there
with
his
outfit
as
if
he
had
come
to
stay
on
his
previous
visit
however
ross
had
nailed
the
english
jack
to
a
mast
on
horsburg
island
one
of
the
group
after
two
years
shreds
of
it
still
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
his
sailors
nothing
loath
began
at
once
the
invasion
of
the
new
kingdom
to
take
possession
of
it
women
and
all
the
force
of
forty
women
with
only
one
man
to
command
them
was
not
equal
to
driving
eight
sturdy
sailors
back
into
the
sea
e
e
in
the
accounts
given
in
findlay
sailing
directory
of
some
of
the
events
there
is
a
chronological
discrepancy
i
follow
the
accounts
gathered
from
the
old
captain
grandsons
and
from
records
on
the
spot
from
this
time
on
hare
had
a
hard
time
of
it
he
and
ross
did
not
get
on
well
as
neighbors
the
islands
were
too
small
and
too
near
for
characters
so
widely
different
hare
had
oceans
of
money
and
might
have
lived
well
in
london
but
he
had
been
governor
of
a
wild
colony
in
borneo
and
could
not
confine
himself
to
the
tame
life
that
prosy
civilization
affords
and
so
he
hung
on
to
the
atoll
with
his
forty
women
retreating
little
by
little
before
ross
and
his
sturdy
crew
till
at
last
he
found
himself
and
his
harem
on
the
little
island
known
to
this
day
as
prison
island
where
like
bluebeard
he
confined
his
wives
in
a
castle
the
channel
between
the
islands
was
narrow
the
water
was
not
deep
and
the
eight
scotch
sailors
wore
long
boots
hare
was
now
dismayed
he
tried
to
compromise
with
rum
and
other
luxuries
but
these
things
only
made
matters
worse
on
the
day
following
the
first
andrew
celebration
on
the
island
hare
consumed
with
rage
and
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
with
the
captain
dashed
off
a
note
to
him
saying
dear
ross
i
thought
when
i
sent
rum
and
roast
pig
to
your
sailors
that
they
would
stay
away
from
my
in
reply
to
which
the
captain
burning
with
indignation
shouted
from
the
center
of
the
island
where
he
stood
ahoy
there
on
prison
island
you
hare
do
you
know
that
rum
and
roast
pig
are
not
a
sailor
heaven
hare
said
afterward
that
one
might
have
heard
the
captain
roar
across
to
java
the
lawless
establishment
was
soon
broken
up
by
the
women
deserting
prison
island
and
putting
themselves
under
ross
protection
hare
then
went
to
batavia
where
he
met
his
death
illustration
the
ashore
for
at
the
keeling
islands
from
a
photograph
my
first
impression
upon
landing
was
that
the
crime
of
infanticide
had
not
reached
the
islands
of
keeling
cocos
the
children
have
all
come
to
welcome
you
explained
ross
as
they
mustered
at
the
jetty
by
hundreds
of
all
ages
and
sizes
the
people
of
this
country
were
all
rather
shy
but
young
or
old
they
never
passed
one
or
saw
one
passing
their
door
without
a
salutation
in
their
musical
voices
they
would
say
are
you
walking
jalan
jalan
will
you
come
along
one
would
answer
for
a
long
time
after
i
arrived
the
children
regarded
the
ship
with
suspicion
and
fear
a
native
man
had
been
blown
away
to
sea
many
years
before
and
they
hinted
to
one
another
that
he
might
have
been
changed
from
black
to
white
and
returned
in
the
sloop
for
some
time
every
movement
i
made
was
closely
watched
they
were
particularly
interested
in
what
i
ate
one
day
after
i
had
been
the
sloop
with
a
composition
of
and
other
stuff
and
while
i
was
taking
my
dinner
with
the
luxury
of
blackberry
jam
i
heard
a
commotion
and
then
a
yell
and
a
stampede
as
the
children
ran
away
yelling
the
captain
is
eating
the
captain
is
eating
but
they
soon
found
out
that
this
same
was
very
good
to
eat
and
that
i
had
brought
a
quantity
of
it
one
day
when
i
was
spreading
a
thick
with
it
for
a
youngster
i
heard
them
whisper
meaning
that
a
shark
had
bitten
my
hand
which
they
observed
was
lame
thenceforth
they
regarded
me
as
a
hero
and
i
had
not
fingers
enough
for
the
little
tots
that
wanted
to
cling
to
them
and
follow
me
about
before
this
when
i
held
out
my
hand
and
said
come
they
would
shy
off
for
the
nearest
house
and
say
dingin
it
cold
or
ujan
it
going
to
rain
but
it
was
now
accepted
that
i
was
not
the
returned
spirit
of
the
lost
black
and
i
had
plenty
of
friends
about
the
island
rain
or
shine
one
day
after
this
when
i
tried
to
haul
the
sloop
and
found
her
fast
in
the
sand
the
children
all
clapped
their
hands
and
cried
that
a
crab
was
holding
her
by
the
keel
and
little
ophelia
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
wrote
in
the
a
hundred
men
with
might
and
main
on
the
windlass
hove
yeo
ho
the
cable
only
came
in
twain
the
ship
she
would
not
go
for
child
to
tell
the
strangest
thing
the
keel
was
held
by
a
great
kpeting
this
being
so
or
not
it
was
decided
that
the
mohammedan
priest
sama
the
emim
for
a
pot
of
jam
should
ask
mohammed
to
bless
the
voyage
and
make
the
crab
let
go
the
sloop
keel
which
it
did
if
it
had
hold
and
she
floated
on
the
very
next
tide
on
the
of
july
arrived
with
justice
andrew
leech
and
court
officers
on
board
on
a
circuit
of
inspection
among
the
straits
settlements
of
which
keeling
cocos
was
a
dependency
to
hear
complaints
and
try
cases
by
law
if
any
there
were
to
try
they
found
the
hauled
ashore
and
tied
to
a
but
at
the
keeling
islands
there
had
not
been
a
grievance
to
complain
of
since
the
day
that
hare
migrated
for
the
rosses
have
always
treated
the
islanders
as
their
own
family
if
there
is
a
paradise
on
this
earth
it
is
keeling
there
was
not
a
case
for
a
lawyer
but
something
had
to
be
done
for
here
were
two
ships
in
port
a
great
and
the
instead
of
a
lawsuit
a
dance
was
got
up
and
all
the
officers
who
could
leave
their
ship
came
ashore
everybody
on
the
island
came
old
and
young
and
the
governor
great
hall
was
filled
with
people
all
that
could
get
on
their
feet
danced
while
the
babies
lay
in
heaps
in
the
corners
of
the
room
content
to
look
on
my
little
friend
ophelia
danced
with
the
judge
for
music
two
fiddles
screeched
over
and
over
again
the
good
old
tune
we
wo
go
home
till
morning
and
we
did
not
the
women
at
the
keelings
do
not
do
all
the
drudgery
as
in
many
places
visited
on
the
voyage
it
would
cheer
the
heart
of
a
fuegian
woman
to
see
the
keeling
lord
of
creation
up
a
besides
cleverly
climbing
the
trees
the
men
of
keeling
build
exquisitely
modeled
canoes
by
far
the
best
workmanship
in
i
saw
on
the
voyage
was
here
many
finished
mechanics
dwelt
under
the
palms
at
keeling
and
the
hum
of
the
and
the
ring
of
the
anvil
were
heard
from
morning
till
night
the
first
scotch
settlers
left
there
the
strength
of
northern
blood
and
the
inheritance
of
steady
habits
no
benevolent
society
has
ever
done
so
much
for
any
islanders
as
the
noble
captain
ross
and
his
sons
who
have
followed
his
example
of
industry
and
thrift
admiral
fitzroy
of
the
who
visited
here
where
many
things
are
reversed
spoke
of
these
singular
though
small
islands
where
crabs
eat
cocoanuts
fish
eat
coral
dogs
catch
fish
men
ride
on
turtles
and
shells
are
dangerous
adding
that
the
greater
part
of
the
roost
on
branches
and
many
rats
make
their
nests
in
the
tops
of
my
vessel
being
refitted
i
decided
to
load
her
with
the
famous
mammoth
tridaena
shell
of
keeling
found
in
the
bayou
near
by
and
right
here
within
sight
of
the
village
i
came
near
losing
the
crew
of
the
not
from
putting
my
foot
in
a
shell
however
but
from
carelessly
neglecting
to
look
after
the
details
of
a
trip
across
the
harbor
in
a
boat
i
had
sailed
over
oceans
i
have
since
completed
a
course
over
them
all
and
sailed
round
the
whole
world
without
so
nearly
meeting
a
fatality
as
on
that
trip
across
a
lagoon
where
i
trusted
all
to
some
one
else
and
he
weak
mortal
that
he
was
perhaps
trusted
all
to
me
however
that
may
be
i
found
myself
with
a
thoughtless
african
negro
in
a
rickety
bateau
that
was
fitted
with
a
rotten
sail
and
this
blew
away
in
in
a
squall
that
sent
us
drifting
helplessly
to
sea
where
we
should
have
been
incontinently
lost
with
the
whole
ocean
before
us
to
leeward
i
was
dismayed
to
see
while
we
drifted
that
there
was
not
a
paddle
or
an
oar
in
the
boat
there
was
an
anchor
to
be
sure
but
not
enough
rope
to
tie
a
cat
and
we
were
already
in
deep
water
by
great
good
fortune
however
there
was
a
pole
plying
this
as
a
paddle
with
the
utmost
energy
and
by
the
merest
accidental
flaw
in
the
wind
to
favor
us
the
trap
of
a
boat
was
worked
into
shoal
water
where
we
could
touch
bottom
and
push
her
ashore
with
africa
the
nearest
coast
to
leeward
three
thousand
miles
away
with
not
so
much
as
a
drop
of
water
in
the
boat
and
a
lean
and
hungry
negro
well
cast
the
lot
as
one
might
the
crew
of
the
in
a
little
while
would
have
been
hard
to
find
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
took
no
more
such
chances
the
tridacna
were
afterward
procured
in
a
safe
boat
thirty
of
them
taking
the
place
of
three
tons
of
cement
ballast
which
i
threw
overboard
to
make
room
and
give
buoyancy

whatever
else
it
was

go
its
hold
and

left
out
of
sight
astern
out
of
sight
i
say
except
in
my
strongest
affection
the
sea
was
rugged
and
the
washed
heavily
when
hauled
on
the
wind
which
course
i
took
for
the
island
of
rodriguez
and
which
brought
the
sea
abeam
the
true
course
for
the
island
was
west
by
south
one
quarter
south
and
the
distance
was
nineteen
hundred
miles
but
i
steered
considerably
to
the
windward
of
that
to
allow
for
the
heave
of
the
sea
and
other
leeward
effects
my
sloop
on
this
course
ran
under
reefed
sails
for
days
together
i
naturally
tired
of
the
motion
of
the
sea
and
above
all
of
the
wetting
i
got
whenever
i
showed
myself
on
deck
under
these
heavy
weather
conditions
the
seemed
to
lag
behind
on
her
course
at
least
i
attributed
to
these
conditions
a
discrepancy
in
the
log
which
by
the
fifteenth
day
out
from
keeling
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
between
the
rotator
and
the
mental
calculations
i
had
kept
of
what
she
should
have
gone
and
so
i
kept
an
eye
lifting
for
land
i
could
see
about
sundown
this
day
a
bunch
of
clouds
that
stood
in
one
spot
right
ahead
while
the
other
clouds
floated
on
this
was
a
sign
of
something
by
midnight
as
the
sloop
sailed
on
a
black
object
appeared
where
i
had
seen
the
resting
clouds
it
was
still
a
long
way
off
but
there
could
be
no
mistaking
this
it
was
the
high
island
of
rodriguez
i
hauled
in
the
patent
log
which
i
was
now
towing
more
from
habit
than
from
necessity
for
i
had
learned
the
and
her
ways
long
before
this
if
one
thing
was
clearer
than
another
in
her
voyage
it
was
that
she
could
be
trusted
to
come
out
right
and
in
safety
though
at
the
same
time
i
always
stood
ready
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
even
the
least
doubt
the
officers
who
are
and
know
it
all
like
a
book
are
the
ones
i
have
observed
who
wreck
the
most
ships
and
lose
the
most
lives
the
cause
of
the
discrepancy
in
the
log
was
one
often
met
with
namely
coming
in
contact
with
some
large
fish
two
out
of
the
four
blades
of
the
rotator
were
crushed
or
bent
the
work
probably
of
a
shark
being
sure
of
the
position
i
lay
down
to
rest
and
to
think
and
i
felt
better
for
it
by
daylight
the
island
was
abeam
about
three
miles
away
it
wore
a
hard
appearance
there
all
alone
far
out
in
the
indian
ocean
like
land
adrift
the
windward
side
was
uninviting
but
there
was
a
good
port
to
leeward
and
i
hauled
in
now
close
on
the
wind
for
that
a
pilot
came
out
to
take
me
into
the
inner
harbor
which
was
reached
through
a
narrow
channel
among
coral
reefs
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
at
all
of
the
islands
some
reality
was
insisted
on
as
unreal
while
improbabilities
were
clothed
as
hard
facts
and
so
it
happened
here
that
the
good
abbe
a
few
days
before
had
been
telling
his
people
about
the
coming
of
antichrist
and
when
they
saw
the
sail
into
the
harbor
all
before
a
gale
of
wind
and
run
all
standing
upon
the
beach
and
with
only
one
man
aboard
they
cried
may
the
lord
help
us
it
is
he
and
he
has
come
in
a
boat
which
i
say
would
have
been
the
most
improbable
way
of
his
coming
nevertheless
the
news
went
flying
through
the
place
the
governor
of
the
island
roberts
came
down
immediately
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
for
the
little
town
was
in
a
great
commotion
one
elderly
woman
when
she
heard
of
my
advent
made
for
her
house
and
locked
herself
in
when
she
heard
that
i
was
actually
coming
up
the
street
she
barricaded
her
doors
and
did
not
come
out
while
i
was
on
the
island
a
period
of
eight
days
governor
roberts
and
his
family
did
not
share
the
fears
of
their
people
but
came
on
board
at
the
jetty
where
the
sloop
was
berthed
and
their
example
induced
others
to
come
also
the
governor
young
boys
took
charge
of
the
dinghy
at
once
and
my
visit
cost
his
excellency
besides
great
hospitality
to
me
the
building
of
a
boat
for
them
like
the
one
belonging
to
the
my
first
day
at
this
land
of
promise
was
to
me
like
a
for
many
days
i
had
studied
the
charts
and
counted
the
time
of
my
arrival
at
this
spot
as
one
might
his
entrance
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
looking
upon
it
as
the
terminus
of
the
last
long
run
made
irksome
by
the
want
of
many
things
with
which
from
this
time
on
i
could
keep
well
supplied
and
behold
here
was
the
sloop
arrived
and
made
securely
fast
to
a
pier
in
rodriguez
on
the
first
evening
ashore
in
the
land
of
napkins
and
cut
glass
i
saw
before
me
still
the
ghosts
of
hempen
towels
and
of
mugs
with
handles
knocked
off
instead
of
tossing
on
the
sea
however
as
i
might
have
been
here
was
i
in
a
bright
hall
surrounded
by
sparkling
wit
and
dining
with
the
governor
of
the
island
aladdin
i
cried
where
is
your
lamp
my
lantern
which
i
got
at
gloucester
has
shown
me
better
things
than
your
smoky
old
burner
ever
revealed
the
second
day
in
port
was
spent
in
receiving
visitors
roberts
and
her
children
came
first
to
shake
hands
they
said
with
the
no
one
was
now
afraid
to
come
on
board
except
the
poor
old
woman
who
still
maintained
that
the
had
antichrist
in
the
hold
if
indeed
he
had
not
already
gone
ashore
the
governor
entertained
that
evening
and
kindly
invited
the
destroyer
of
the
world
to
speak
for
himself
this
he
did
elaborating
most
effusively
on
the
dangers
of
the
sea
which
after
the
manner
of
many
of
our
frailest
mortals
he
would
have
had
smooth
had
he
made
it
also
by
contrivances
of
light
and
darkness
he
exhibited
on
the
wall
pictures
of
the
places
and
countries
visited
on
the
voyage
nothing
like
the
countries
however
that
he
would
have
made
and
of
the
people
seen
savage
and
other
frequently
groaning
wicked
world
wicked
world
when
this
was
finished
his
excellency
the
governor
speaking
words
of
thankfulness
distributed
pieces
of
gold
on
the
following
day
i
accompanied
his
excellency
and
family
on
a
visit
to
san
gabriel
which
was
up
the
country
among
the
hills
the
good
abbe
of
san
gabriel
entertained
us
all
royally
at
the
convent
and
we
remained
his
guests
until
the
following
day
as
i
was
leaving
his

at

about
noon
the

was
towed
in
later
on
the

day
by
the
doctor
launch
after
he
was
satisfied
that
i
had
mustered
all
the
crew
for
inspection
of
this
he
seemed
in
doubt
until
he
examined
the
papers
which
called
for
a
crew
of
one
all
told
from
port
to
port
throughout
the
voyage
then
finding
that
i
had
been
well
enough
to
come
thus
far
alone
he
gave
me
pratique
without
further
ado
there
was
still
another
official
visit
for
the
to
pass
farther
in
the
harbor
the
governor
of
rodriguez
who
had
most
kindly
given
me
besides
a
regular
mail
private
letters
of
introduction
to
friends
told
me
i
should
meet
first
of
all
jenkins
of
the
postal
service
a
good
man
how
do
you
do
mr
jenkins
cried
i
as
his
boat
swung
alongside
you
do
know
me
he
said
why
not
i
replied
from
where
is
the
sloop
from
around
the
world
i
again
replied
very
solemnly
and
alone
yes
why
not
and
you
know
me
three
thousand
years
ago
cried
i
when
you
and
i
had
a
warmer
job
than
we
have
now
even
this
was
hot
you
were
then
jenkinson
but
if
you
have
changed
your
name
i
do
blame
you
for
that
jenkins
forbearing
soul
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
jest
which
served
the
a
good
turn
for
on
the
strength
of
this
tale
it
got
out
that
if
any
one
should
go
on
board
after
dark
the
devil
would
get
him
at
once
and
so
i
could
leave
the
without
the
fear
of
her
being
robbed
at
night
the
cabin
to
be
sure
was
broken
into
but
it
was
done
in
daylight
and
the
thieves
got
no
more
than
a
box
of
smoked
herrings
before
tom
ledson
one
of
the
port
officials
caught
them
as
it
were
and
sent
them
to
jail
this
was
discouraging
to
pilferers
for
they
feared
ledson
more
than
they
feared
satan
himself
even
mamode
hajee
ayoob
who
was
the
on
board
till
an
empty
box
fell
over
in
the
cabin
and
frightened
him
out
of
his
wits
could
not
be
hired
to
watch
nights
or
even
till
the
sun
went
down
sahib
he
cried
there
is
no
need
of
it
and
what
he
said
was
perfectly
true
at
mauritius
where
i
drew
a
long
breath
the
rested
her
wings
it
being
the
season
of
fine
weather
the
hardships
of
the
voyage
if
there
had
been
any
were
now
computed
by
officers
of
experience
as
nine
tenths
finished
and
yet
somehow
i
could
not
forget
that
the
united
states
was
still
a
long
way
off
the
kind
people
of
mauritius
to
make
me
richer
and
happier
rigged
up
the
which
they
had
named
the
f
all
decks
and
no
bottom
was
this
ship
but
she
was
as
stiff
as
a
church
they
gave
me
free
use
of
it
while
i
talked
over
the
adventures
his
honor
the
mayor
introduced
me
to
his
excellency
the
governor
from
the
of
the
in
this
way
i
was
also
introduced
again
to
our
good
consul
general
john
campbell
who
had
already
introduced
me
to
his
excellency
i
was
becoming
well
acquainted
and
was
in
for
it
now
to
sail
the
voyage
over
again
how
i
got
through
the
story
i
hardly
know
it
was
a
hot
night
and
i
could
have
choked
the
tailor
who
made
the
coat
i
wore
for
this
occasion
the
kind
governor
saw
that
i
had
done
my
part
trying
to
rig
like
a
man
ashore
and
he
invited
me
to
government
house
at
reduit
where
i
found
myself
among
friends
f
it
was
winter
still
off
stormy
cape
of
good
hope
but
the
storms
might
whistle
there
i
determined
to
see
it
out
in
milder
mauritius
visiting
rose
hill
curipepe
and
other
places
on
the
island
i
spent
a
day
with
the
elder
roberts
father
of
governor
roberts
of
rodriguez
and
with
his
friends
the
very
reverend
fathers
and
mccarthy
returning
to
the
by
way
of
the
great
flower
conservatory
near
moka
the
proprietor
having
only
that
morning
discovered
a
new
and
hardy
plant
to
my
great
honor
named
it
slocum
which
he
said
latinized
it
at
once
saving
him
some
trouble
on
the
twist
of
a
word
and
the
good
botanist
seemed
pleased
that
i
had
come
how
different
things
are
in
different
countries
in
boston
massachusetts
at
that
time
a
gentleman
so
i
was
told
paid
thirty
thousand
dollars
to
have
a
flower
named
after
his
wife
and
it
was
not
a
big
flower
either
while
slocum
which
came
without
the
asking
was
bigger
than
a
i
was
royally
entertained
at
moka
as
well
as
at
reduit
and
other
places
once
by
seven
young
ladies
to
whom
i
spoke
of
my
inability
to
return
their
hospitality
except
in
my
own
poor
way
of
taking
them
on
a
sail
in
the
sloop
the
very
thing
the
very
thing
they
all
cried
then
please
name
the
time
i
said
as
meek
as
moses
they
all
cried
and
aunty
we
may
go
may
we
and
we
be
real
good
for
a
whole
week
afterward
aunty
say
yes
aunty
dear
all
this
after
saying
for
girls
in
mauritius
are
after
all
the
same
as
our
girls
in
america
and
their
dear
aunt
said
me
too
about
the
same
as
any
really
good
aunt
might
say
in
my
own
country
i
was
then
in
a
quandary
it
having
recurred
to
me
that
on
the
very
i
was
to
dine
with
the
captain
wilson
however
i
said
to
myself
the
will
run
out
quickly
into
rough
seas
these
young
ladies
will
have
de
and
a
good
time
and
i
get
in
early
enough
to
be
at
the
dinner
after
all
but
not
a
bit
of
it
we
sailed
almost
out
of
sight
of
mauritius
and
they
just
stood
up
and
laughed
at
seas
tumbling
aboard
while
i
was
at
the
helm
making
the
worst
weather
of
it
i
could
and
spinning
yarns
to
the
aunt
about
and
whales
but
she
dear
lady
when
i
had
finished
with
stories
of
monsters
only
hinted
at
a
basket
of
provisions
they
had
brought
along
enough
to
last
a
week
for
i
had
told
them
about
my
wretched
steward
the
more
the
tried
to
make
these
young
ladies
seasick
the
more
they
all
clapped
their
hands
and
said
how
lovely
it
is
and
how
beautifully
she
skims
over
the
sea
and
how
beautiful
our
island
appears
from
the
distance
and
they
still
cried
go
on
we
were
fifteen
miles
or
more
at
sea
before
they
ceased
the
eager
cry
go
on
then
the
sloop
swung
round
i
still
hoping
to
be
back
to
port
louis
in
time
to
keep
my
appointment
the
reached
the
island
quickly
and
flew
along
the
coast
fast
enough
but
i
made
a
mistake
in
steering
along
the
coast
on
the
way
home
for
as
we
came
abreast
of
tombo
bay
it
enchanted
my
crew
oh
let
anchor
here
they
cried
to
this
no
sailor
in
the
world
would
have
said
nay
the
sloop
came
to
anchor
ten
minutes
later
as
they
wished
and
a
young
man
on
the
cliff
abreast
waving
his
hat
cried
la
spray
my
passengers
said
aunty
may
we
have
a
swim
in
the
surf
along
the
shore
just
then
the
launch
hove
in
sight
coming
out
to
meet
us
but
it
was
too
late
to
get
the
sloop
into
port
louis
that
night
the
launch
was
in
time
however
to
land
my
fair
crew
for
a
swim
but
they
were
determined
not
to
desert
the
ship
meanwhile
i
prepared
a
roof
for
the
night
on
deck
with
the
sails
and
a
bengali
arranged
the
evening
meal
that
night
the
rode
in
tombo
bay
with
her
precious
freight
next
morning
bright
and
early
even
before
the
stars
were
gone
i
awoke
to
hear
praying
on
deck
the
port
officers
launch
reappeared
later
in
the
morning
this
time
with
captain
wilson
himself
on
board
to
try
his
luck
in
getting
the
into
port
for
he
had
heard
of
our
predicament
it
was
worth
something
to
hear
a
friend
tell
afterward
how
earnestly
the
good
of
mauritius
said
i
find
the
and
i
get
her
into
port
a
merry
crew
he
discovered
on
her
they
could
hoist
sails
like
old
tars
and
could
trim
them
too
they
could
tell
all
about
the
ship
hoods
and
one
should
have
seen
them
clap
a
bonnet
on
the
jib
like
the
deepest
of
sailors
they
could
heave
the
lead
and
as
i
hope
to
see
mauritius
again
any
of
them
could
have
put
the
sloop
in
stays
no
ship
ever
had
a
fairer
crew
the
voyage
was
the
event
of
port
louis
such
a
thing
as
young
ladies
sailing
about
the
harbor
even
was
almost
unheard
of
before
while
at
mauritius
the
was
tendered
the
use
of
the
military
dock
free
of
charge
and
was
thoroughly
refitted
by
the
port
authorities
my
sincere
gratitude
is
also
due
other
friends
for
many
things
needful
for
the
voyage
put
on
board
including
bags
of
sugar
from
some
of
the
famous
old
plantations
the
favorable
season
now
set
in
and
thus
well
equipped
on
the
of
october
the
put
to
sea
as
i
sailed
before
a
light
wind
the
island
receded
slowly
and
on
the
following
day
i
could
still
see
the
puce
mountain
near
moka
the
arrived
next
day
off
galets
reunion
and
a
pilot
came
out
and
spoke
her
i
handed
him
a
mauritius
paper
and
continued
on
my
voyage
for
rollers
were
running
heavily
at
the
time
and
it
was
not
practicable
to
make
a
landing
from
reunion
i
shaped
a
course
direct
for
cape
mary
madagascar
the
sloop
was
now
drawing
near
the
limits
of
the
and
the
strong
breeze
that
had
carried
her
with
free
sheets
the
many
thousands
of
miles
from
sandy
cape
australia
fell
lighter
each
day
until
october
when
it
was
altogether
calm
and
a
motionless
sea
held
her
in
a
hushed
world
i
furled
the
sails
at
evening
sat
down
on
deck
and
enjoyed
the
vast
stillness
of
the
night
october
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
the
sloop
passed
cape
mary
about
noon
on
the
and
of
november
in
the
mozambique
channel
she
experienced
a
hard
gale
of
wind
from
the
southwest
here
the
suffered
as
much
as
she
did
anywhere
except
off
cape
horn
the
thunder
and
lightning
preceding
this
gale
were
very
heavy
from
this
point
until
the
sloop
arrived
off
the
coast
of
africa
she
encountered
a
succession
of
gales
of
wind
which
drove
her
about
in
many
directions
but
on
the
of
november
she
arrived
at
port
natal
this
delightful
place
is
the
commercial
center
of
the
garden
colony
durban
itself
the
city
being
the
continuation
of
a
garden
the
signalman
from
the
bluff
station
reported
the
fifteen
miles
off
the
wind
was
freshening
and
when
she
was
within
eight
miles
he
said
the
is
shortening
sail
the
mainsail
was
reefed
and
set
in
ten
minutes
one
man
is
doing
all
the
work
this
item
of
news
was
printed
three
minutes
later
in
a
durban
morning
journal
which
was
handed
to
me
when
i
arrived
in
port
i
could
not
verify
the
time
it
had
taken
to
reef
the
sail
for
as
i
have
already
said
the
of
my
timepiece
was
gone
i
only
knew
that
i
reefed
as
quickly
as
i
could
the
same
paper
commenting
on
the
voyage
said
judging
from
the
stormy
weather
which
has
prevailed
off
this
coast
during
the
past
few
weeks
the
must
have
had
a
very
stormy
voyage
from
mauritius
to
natal
doubtless
the
weather
would
have
been
called
stormy
by
sailors
in
any
ship
but
it
caused
the
no
more
inconvenience
than
the
delay
natural
to
head
winds
generally
the
question
of
how
i
sailed
the
sloop
alone
often
asked
is
best
answered
perhaps
by
a
durban
newspaper
i
would
shrink
from
repeating
the
editor
words
but
for
the
reason
that
undue
estimates
have
been
made
of
the
amount
of
skill
and
energy
required
to
sail
a
sloop
of
even
the
small
tonnage
i
heard
a
man
who
called
himself
a
sailor
say
that
it
would
require
three
men
to
do
what
it
was
claimed
that
i
did
alone
and
what
i
found
perfectly
easy
to
do
over
and
over
again
and
i
have
heard
that
others
made
similar
nonsensical
remarks
adding
that
i
would
work
myself
to
death
but
here
is
what
the
durban
paper
said
citation
as
briefly
noted
yesterday
the
with
a
crew
of
one
man
arrived
at
this
port
yesterday
afternoon
on
her
cruise
round
the
world
the
made
quite
an
auspicious
entrance
to
natal
her
commander
sailed
his
craft
right
up
the
channel
past
the
main
wharf
and
dropped
his
anchor
near
the
old
in
the
creek
before
any
one
had
a
chance
to
get
on
board
the
was
naturally
an
object
of
great
curiosity
to
the
point
people
and
her
arrival
was
witnessed
by
a
large
crowd
the
skilful
manner
in
which
captain
slocum
steered
his
craft
about
the
vessels
which
were
occupying
the
waterway
was
a
treat
to
witness
the
was
not
sailing
in
among
greenhorns
when
she
came
to
natal
when
she
arrived
off
the
port
the
a
fine
able
came
out
to
meet
her
and
led
the
way
in
across
the
bar
for
it
was
blowing
a
smart
gale
and
was
too
rough
for
the
sloop
to
be
towed
with
safety
the
trick
of
going
in
i
learned
by
watching
the
steamer
it
was
simply
to
keep
on
the
windward
side
of
the
channel
and
take
the
combers
end
on
illustration
captain
joshua
slocum
i
found
that
durban
supported
two
both
of
them
full
of
enterprise
i
met
all
the
members
of
both
clubs
and
sailed
in
the
crack
yacht
of
the
royal

with
captain
spradbrow

spradbrow
in
retort
warned
me
of
it
said
he
you
would
be
played
out
of
the
sloop
before
you
could
round
the
cape
by
others
it
was
not
thought
probable
that
the
premier
of
natal
would
play
cribbage
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
win
even
the
it
was
a
matter
of
no
small
pride
to
me
in
south
africa
to
find
that
american
humor
was
never
at
a
discount
and
one
of
the
best
american
stories
i
ever
heard
was
told
by
the
premier
at
hotel
royal
one
day
dining
with
colonel
saunderson
his
son
and
lieutenant
tipping
i
met
stanley
the
great
explorer
was
just
from
pretoria
and
had
already
as
good
as
flayed
president
kr√ºger
with
his
trenchant
pen
but
that
did
not
signify
for
everybody
has
a
whack
at
oom
paul
and
no
one
in
the
world
seems
to
stand
the
joke
better
than
he
not
even
the
sultan
of
turkey
himself
the
colonel
introduced
me
to
the
explorer
and
i
hauled
close
to
the
wind
to
go
slow
for
stanley
was
a
nautical
man
once
himself
on
the
nyanza
i
think
and
of
course
my
desire
was
to
appear
in
the
best
light
before
a
man
of
his
experience
he
looked
me
over
carefully
and
said
what
an
example
of
patience
patience
is
all
that
is
required
i
ventured
to
reply
he
then
asked
if
my
vessel
had
compartments
i
explained
that
she
was
all
and
all
compartment
what
if
she
should
strike
a
rock
he
asked
compartments
would
not
save
her
if
she
should
hit
the
rocks
lying
along
her
course
said
i
adding
she
must
be
kept
away
from
the
rocks
after
a
considerable
pause
stanley
asked
what
if
a
swordfish
should
pierce
her
hull
with
its
sword
of
course
i
had
thought
of
that
as
one
of
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
also
of
the
chance
of
being
struck
by
lightning
in
the
case
of
the
swordfish
i
ventured
to
say
that
the
first
thing
would
be
to
secure
the
sword
the
colonel
invited
me
to
dine
with
the
party
on
the
following
day
that
we
might
go
further
into
this
matter
and
so
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
stanley
a
second
time
but
got
no
more
hints
in
navigation
from
the
famous
explorer
it
sounds
odd
to
hear
scholars
and
statesmen
say
the
world
is
flat
but
it
is
a
fact
that
three
boers
favored
by
the
opinion
of
president
kr√ºger
prepared
a
work
to
support
that
contention
while
i
was
at
durban
they
came
from
pretoria
to
obtain
data
from
me
and
they
seemed
annoyed
when
i
told
them
that
they
could
not
prove
it
by
my
experience
with
the
advice
to
call
up
some
ghost
of
the
dark
ages
for
research
i
went
ashore
and
left
these
three
wise
men
poring
over
the
track
on
a
chart
of
the
world
which
however
proved
nothing
to
them
for
it
was
on
mercator
projection
and
behold
it
was
flat
the
next
morning
i
met
one
of
the
party
in
a
garb
carrying
a
large
bible
not
different
from
the
one
i
had
read
he
tackled
me
saying
if
you
respect
the
word
of
god
you
must
admit
that
the
world
is
flat
if
the
word
of
god
stands
on
a
flat
world
i
began
what
cried
he
losing
himself
in
a
passion
and
making
as
if
he
would
run
me
through
with
an
assagai
what
he
shouted
in
astonishment
and
rage
while
i
jumped
aside
to
dodge
the
imaginary
weapon
had
this
good
but
misguided
fanatic
been
armed
with
a
real
weapon
the
crew
of
the
would
have
died
a
martyr
there
and
then
the
next
day
seeing
him
across
the
street
i
bowed
and
made
curves
with
my
hands
he
responded
with
a
level
swimming
movement
of
his
hands
meaning
the
world
is
flat
a
pamphlet
by
these
transvaal
geographers
made
up
of
arguments
from
sources
high
and
low
to
prove
their
theory
was
mailed
to
me
before
i
sailed
from
africa
on
my
last
stretch
around
the
globe
while
i
feebly
portray
the
ignorance
of
these
learned
men
i
have
great
admiration
for
their
physical
manhood
much
that
i
saw
first
and
last
of
the
transvaal
and
the
boers
was
admirable
it
is
well
known
that
they
are
the
hardest
of
fighters
and
as
generous
to
the
fallen
as
they
are
brave
before
the
foe
real
stubborn
bigotry
with
them
is
only
found
among
old
fogies
and
will
die
a
natural
death
and
that
too
perhaps
long
before
we
ourselves
are
entirely
free
from
bigotry
education
in
the
transvaal
is
by
no
means
neglected
english
as
well
as
dutch
being
taught
to
all
that
can
afford
both
but
the
tariff
duty
on
english
is
heavy
and
from
necessity
the
poorer
people
stick
to
the
transvaal
dutch
and
their
flat
world
just
as
in
samoa
and
other
islands
a
mistaken
policy
has
kept
the
natives
down
to
kanaka
i
visited
many
public
schools
at
durban
and
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
many
bright
children
but
all
fine
things
must
end
and
december
the
crew
of
the
after
having
a
fine
time
in
natal
swung
the
sloop
dinghy
in
on
deck
and
sailed
with
a
morning
which
carried
her
clear
of
the
bar
and
again
she
was
off
on
her
alone
as
they
say
in
australia
chapter
xviii
rounding
the
cape
of
storms
in
olden
time
a
rough
christmas
the
ties
up
for
a
three
months
rest
at
cape
town
a
railway
trip
to
the
transvaal
president
kr√ºger
odd
definition
of
the
voyage
his
terse
sayings
distinguished
guests
on
the
cocoanut
fiber
as
a
padlock
courtesies
from
the
admiral
of
the
queen
navy
off
for
helena
land
in
sight
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
now
the
most
prominent
point
to
pass
from
table
bay
i
could
count
on
the
aid
of
brisk
trades
and
then
the
would
soon
be
at
home
on
the
first
day
out
from
durban
it
fell
calm
and
i
sat
thinking
about
these
things
and
the
end
of
the
voyage
the
distance
to
table
bay
where
i
intended
to
call
was
about
eight
hundred
miles
over
what
might
prove
a
rough
sea
the
early
portuguese
navigators
endowed
with
patience
were
more
than
years
struggling
to
round
this
cape
before
they
got
as
far
as
algoa
bay
and
there
the
crew
mutinied
they
landed
on
a
small
island
now
called
santa
cruz
where
they
devoutly
set
up
the
cross
and
swore
they
would
cut
the
captain
throat
if
he
attempted
to
sail
farther
beyond
this
they
thought
was
the
edge
of
the
world
which
they
too
believed
was
flat
and
fearing
that
their
ship
would
sail
over
the
brink
of
it
they
compelled
captain
diaz
their
commander
to
retrace
his
course
all
being
only
too
glad
to
get
home
a
year
later
we
are
told
vasco
da
gama
sailed
successfully
round
the
cape
of
storms
as
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
then
called
and
discovered
natal
on
christmas
or
natal
day
hence
the
name
from
this
point
the
way
to
india
was
easy
gales
of
wind
sweeping
round
the
cape
even
now
were
frequent
enough
one
occurring
on
an
average
every
hours
but
one
gale
was
much
the
same
as
another
with
no
more
serious
result
than
to
blow
the
along
on
her
course
when
it
was
fair
or
to
blow
her
back
somewhat
when
it
was
ahead
on
christmas
i
came
to
the
pitch
of
the
cape
on
this
day
the
was
trying
to
stand
on
her
head
and
she
gave
me
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
would
accomplish
the
feat
before
night
she
began
very
early
in
the
morning
to
pitch
and
toss
about
in
a
most
unusual
manner
and
i
have
to
record
that
while
i
was
at
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
reefing
the
jib
she
ducked
me
under
water
three
times
for
a
christmas
box
i
got
wet
and
did
not
like
it
a
bit
never
in
any
other
sea
was
i
put
under
more
than
once
in
the
same
short
space
of
time
say
three
minutes
a
large
english
steamer
passing
ran
up
the
signal
wishing
you
a
merry
christmas
i
think
the
captain
was
a
humorist
his
own
ship
was
throwing
her
propeller
out
of
water
two
days
later
the
having
recovered
the
distance
lost
in
the
gale
passed
cape
agulhas
in
company
with
the
steamship
now
with
a
fair
wind
the
keeper
of
the
light
on
agulhas
exchanged
signals
with
the
as
she
passed
and
afterward
wrote
me
at
new
york
congratulations
on
the
completion
of
the
voyage
he
seemed
to
think
the
incident
of
two
ships
of
so
widely
different
types
passing
his
cape
together
worthy
of
a
place
on
canvas
and
he
went
about
having
the
picture
made
so
i
gathered
from
his
letter
at
lonely
stations
like
this
hearts
grow
responsive
and
sympathetic
and
even
poetic
this
feeling
was
shown
toward
the
along
many
a
rugged
coast
and
reading
many
a
kind
signal
thrown
out
to
her
gave
one
a
grateful
feeling
for
all
the
world
one
more
gale
of
wind
came
down
upon
the
from
the
west
after
she
passed
cape
agulhas
but
that
one
she
dodged
by
getting
into
simons
bay
when
it
moderated
she
beat
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
where
they
say
the
is
still
sailing
the
voyage
then
seemed
as
good
as
finished
from
this
time
on
i
knew
that
all
or
nearly
all
would
be
plain
sailing
here
i
crossed
the
of
weather
to
the
north
it
was
clear
and
settled
while
south
it
was
humid
and
squally
with
often
enough
as
i
have
said
a
treacherous
gale
from
the
recent
hard
weather
the
ran
into
a
calm
under
table
mountain
where
she
lay
quietly
till
the
generous
sun
rose
over
the
land
and
drew
a
breeze
in
from
the
sea
the
then
out
looking
for
ships
came
to
the
off
the
lion
rump
and
in
lieu
of
a
larger
ship
towed
her
into
port
the
sea
being
smooth
she
came
to
anchor
in
the
bay
off
the
city
of
cape
town
where
she
remained
a
day
simply
to
rest
clear
of
the
bustle
of
commerce
the
good
sent
his
to
bring
the
sloop
to
a
berth
in
dock
at
once
but
i
preferred
to
remain
for
one
day
alone
in
the
quiet
of
a
smooth
sea
enjoying
the
retrospect
of
the
passage
of
the
two
great
capes
on
the
following
morning
the
sailed
into
the
alfred
where
she
remained
for
about
three
months
in
the
care
of
the
port
authorities
while
i
traveled
the
country
over
from
simons
town
to
pretoria
being
accorded
by
the
colonial
government
a
free
railroad
pass
over
all
the
land
the
trip
to
kimberley
johannesburg
and
pretoria
was
a
pleasant
one
at
the
place
i
met
kr√ºger
the
transvaal
president
his
excellency
received
me
cordially
enough
but
my
friend
judge
beyers
the
gentleman
who
presented
me
by
mentioning
that
i
was
on
a
voyage
around
the
world
unwittingly
gave
great
offense
to
the
venerable
statesman
which
we
both
regretted
deeply
kr√ºger
corrected
the
judge
rather
sharply
reminding
him
that
the
world
is
flat
you
mean
the
world
said
the
president
it
is
impossible
you
mean
the
world
impossible
he
said
impossible
and
not
another
word
did
he
utter
either
to
the
judge
or
to
me
the
judge
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
the
judge
who
should
have
known
his
ground
so
to
speak
and
kr√ºger
glowered
at
us
both
my
friend
the
judge
seemed
embarrassed
but
i
was
delighted
the
incident
pleased
me
more
than
anything
else
that
could
have
happened
it
was
a
nugget
of
information
quarried
out
of
oom
paul
some
of
whose
sayings
are
famous
of
the
english
he
said
they
took
first
my
coat
and
then
my
trousers
he
also
said
dynamite

who

from

agreeable

his

after

sat
on

with

away
in

dinghy
took
snap
shots
of
the
sloop
and
her
distinguished
visitors
david

astronomer
royal
who
was
of
the
party
invited
me
the
next
day
to
the
famous
cape
observatory
an
hour
with
gill
was
an
hour
among
the
stars
his
discoveries
in
stellar
photography
are
well
known
he
showed
me
the
great
astronomical
clock
of
the
observatory
and
i
showed
him
the
tin
clock
on
the
and
we
went
over
the
subject
of
standard
time
at
sea
and
how
it
was
found
from
the
deck
of
the
little
sloop
without
the
aid
of
a
clock
of
any
kind
later
it
was
advertised
that
gill
would
preside
at
a
talk
about
the
voyage
of
the
that
alone
secured
for
me
a
full
house
the
hall
was
packed
and
many
were
not
able
to
get
in
this
success
brought
me
sufficient
money
for
all
my
needs
in
port
and
for
the
homeward
voyage
g
colonel
saunderson
was
kr√ºger
very
best
friend
inasmuch
as
he
advised
the
president
to
avast
mounting
guns
after
visiting
kimberley
and
pretoria
and
finding
the
all
right
in
the
docks
i
returned
to
worcester
and
wellington
towns
famous
for
colleges
and
seminaries
passed
coming
in
still
traveling
as
the
guest
of
the
colony
the
ladies
of
all
these
institutions
of
learning
wished
to
know
how
one
might
sail
round
the
world
alone
which
i
thought
augured
of
in
the
future
instead
of
it
will
come
to
that
yet
if
we
keep
on
saying
we
ca
on
the
plains
of
africa
i
passed
through
hundreds
of
miles
of
rich
but
still
barren
land
save
for
on
which
herds
of
sheep
were
browsing
the
bushes
grew
about
the
length
of
a
sheep
apart
and
they
i
thought
were
rather
long
of
body
but
there
was
still
room
for
all
my
longing
for
a
foothold
on
land
seized
upon
me
here
where
so
much
of
it
lay
waste
but
instead
of
remaining
to
plant
forests
and
reclaim
vegetation
i
returned
again
to
the
at
the
alfred
docks
where
i
found
her
waiting
for
me
with
everything
in
order
exactly
as
i
had
left
her
i
have
often
been
asked
how
it
was
that
my
vessel
and
all
appurtenances
were
not
stolen
in
the
various
ports
where
i
left
her
for
days
together
without
a
watchman
in
charge
this
is
just
how
it
was
the
seldom
fell
among
thieves
at
the
keeling
islands
at
rodriguez
and
at
many
such
places
a
wisp
of
cocoanut
fiber
in
the
to
indicate
that
the
owner
was
away
secured
the
goods
against
even
a
longing
glance
but
when
i
came
to
a
great
island
nearer
home
stout
locks
were
needed
the
first
night
in
port
things
which
i
had
always
left
uncovered
disappeared
as
if
the
deck
on
which
they
were
stowed
had
been
swept

with
the
trend
of
admiral
rawson
questions
and
that
i
profited
by
some
of
his
suggestions
notwithstanding
the
wide
difference
in
our
respective
commands
on
march
the
sailed
from
south
africa
the
land
of
distances
and
pure
air
where
she
had
spent
a
pleasant
and
profitable
time
the
towed
her
to
sea
from
her
wonted
berth
at
the
alfred
docks
giving
her
a
good
offing
the
light
morning
breeze
which
scantily
filled
her
sails
when
the
tug
let
go
the
soon
died
away
altogether
and
left
her
riding
over
a
heavy
swell
in
full
view
of
table
mountain
and
the
high
peaks
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
a
while
the
grand
scenery
served
to
relieve
the
monotony
one
of
the
old
circumnavigators
sir
francis
drake
i
think
when
he
first
saw
this
magnificent
pile
sang
is
the
fairest
thing
and
the
grandest
cape
i
seen
in
the
whole
circumference
of
the
earth
the
view
was
certainly
fine
but
one
has
no
wish
to
linger
long
to
look
in
a
calm
at
anything
and
i
was
glad
to
note
finally
the
short
heaving
sea
precursor
of
the
wind
which
followed
on
the
second
day
seals
playing
about
the
all
day
before
the
breeze
came
looked
with
large
eyes
when
at
evening
she
sat
no
longer
like
a
lazy
bird
with
folded
wings
they
parted
company
now
and
the
soon
sailed
the
highest
peaks
of
the
mountains
out
of
sight
and
the
world
changed
from
a
mere
panoramic
view
to
the
light
of
a
voyage
porpoises
and
dolphins
and
such
other
fishes
as
did
not
mind
making
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
a
day
were
her
companions
now
for
several
days
the
wind
was
from
the
southeast
this
suited
the
well
and
she
ran
along
steadily
at
her
best
speed
while
i
dipped
into
the
new
books
given
me
at
the
cape
reading
day
and
night
march
was
for
me
a
in
honor
of
them
i
read
on
oblivious
of
hunger
or
wind
or
sea
thinking
that
all
was
going
well
when
suddenly
a
comber
rolled
over
the
stern
and
slopped
saucily
into
the
cabin
wetting
the
very
book
i
was
reading
evidently
it
was
time
to
put
in
a
reef
that
she
might
not
wallow
on
her
course
illustration
reading
day
and
night
march
the
fresh
southeast
wind
had
come
to
stay
the
was
running
under
a
mainsail
a
whole
jib
and
a
besides
set
on
the
vailima
bamboo
while
i
was
reading
delightful
inland
voyage
the
sloop
was
again
doing
her
work
smoothly
hardly
rolling
at
all
but
just
leaping
along
among
the
white
horses
a
thousand
gamboling
porpoises
keeping
her
company
on
all
sides
she
was
again
among
her
old
friends
the
interesting
denizens
of
the
sea
shooting
out
of
the
waves
like
arrows
and
with
outstretched
wings
they
sailed
on
the
wind
in
graceful
curves
then
falling
till
again
they
touched
the
crest
of
the
waves
to
wet
their
delicate
wings
and
renew
the
flight
they
made
merry
the
livelong
day
one
of
the
joyful
sights
on
the
ocean
of
a
bright
day
is
the
continual
flight
of
these
interesting
fish
one
could
not
be
lonely
in
a
sea
like
this
moreover
the
reading
of
delightful
adventures
enhanced
the
scene
i
was
now
in
the
and
on
the
oise
in
the
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
so
the
reeled
off
the
miles
showing
a
good
run
every
day
till
april
which
came
almost
before
i
knew
it
very
early
that
morning
i
was
awakened
by
that
rare
bird
the
booby
with
its
harsh
quack
which
i
recognized
at
once
as
a
call
to
go
on
deck
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
skipper
there
land
in
sight
i
tumbled
out
quickly
and
sure
enough
away
ahead
in
the
dim
twilight
about
twenty
miles
off
was
helena
my
first
impulse
was
to
call
out
oh
what
a
speck
in
the
sea
it
is
in
reality
nine
miles
in
length
and
two
thousand
eight
hundred
and
feet
in
height
i
reached
for
a
bottle
of
out
of
the
locker
and
took
a
long
pull
from
it
to
the
health
of
my
invisible
helmsman
the
pilot
of
the
chapter
xix
in
the
isle
of
napoleon
exile
two
lectures
a
guest
in
the
at

house
an
excursion
to
historic
longwood
coffee
in
the
husk
and
a
goat
to
shell

the
ill
luck
with
animals
a
prejudice
against
small
dogs
a
rat
the
boston
spider
and
the
cannibal
cricket
ascension
island
it
was
about
noon
when
the
came
to
anchor
off
jamestown
and
all
hands
at
once
went
ashore
to
pay
respects
to
his
excellency
the
governor
of
the
island
sir
sterndale
his
excellency
when
i
landed
remarked
that
it
was
not
often
nowadays
that
a
circumnavigator
came
his
way
and
he
cordially
welcomed
me
and
arranged
that
i
should
tell
about
the
voyage
first
at
garden
hall
to
the
people
of
jamestown
and
then
at
plantation
house
the
residence
which
is
in
the
hills
a
mile
or
two
back
to
his
excellency
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
and
their
friends
poole
our
worthy
consul
introduced
me
at
the
castle
and
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
asserted
that
the
was
a
yankee
most
royally
was
the
crew
of
the
entertained
by
the
governor
i
remained
at
plantation
house
a
couple
of
days
and
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
mansion
called
the
west
room
being
haunted
the
butler
by
command
of
his
excellency
put
me
up
in
that
like
a
prince
indeed
to
make
sure
that
no
mistake
had
been
made
his
excellency
came
later
to
see
that
i
was
in
the
right
room
and
to
tell
me
all
about
the
ghosts
he
had
seen
or
heard
of
he
had
discovered
all
but
one
and
wishing
me
pleasant
dreams
he
hoped
i
might
have
the
honor
of
a
visit
from
the
unknown
one
of
the
west
room
for
the
rest
of
the
chilly
night
i
kept
the
candle
burning
and
often
looked
from
under
the
blankets
thinking
that
maybe
i
should
meet
the
great
napoleon
face
to
face
but
i
saw
only
furniture
and
the
horseshoe
that
was
nailed
over
the
door
opposite
my
bed
helena
has
been
an
island
of
tragedies
tragedies
that
have
been
lost
sight
of
in
wailing
over
the
corsican
on
the
second
day
of
my
visit
the
governor
took
me
by
through
the
turns
over
the
island
at
one
point
of
our
journey
the
road
in
winding
around
spurs
and
ravines
formed
a
perfect
w
within
the
distance
of
a
few
rods
the
roads
though
tortuous
and
steep
were
fairly
good
and
i
was
struck
with
the
amount
of
labor
it
must
have
cost
to
build
them
the
air
on
the
heights
was
cool
and
bracing
it
is
said
that
since
hanging
for
trivial
offenses
went
out
of
fashion
no
one
has
died
there
except
from
falling
over
the
cliffs
in
old
age
or
from
being
crushed
by
stones
rolling
on
them
from
the
steep
mountains
witches
at
one
time
were
persistent
at
helena
as
with
us
in
america
in
the
days
of
cotton
mather
at
the
present
day
crime
is
rare
in
the
island
while
i
was
there
governor
sterndale
in
token
of
the
fact
that
not
one
criminal
case
had
come
to
court
within
the
year
was
presented
with
a
pair
of
white
gloves
by
the
officers
of
justice
returning
from
the
governor
house
to
jamestown
i
drove
with
clark
a
countryman
of
mine
to
longwood
the
home
of
napoleon
morilleau
french
consular
agent
in
charge
keeps
the
place
respectable
and
the
buildings
in
good
repair
his
family
at
longwood
consisting
of
wife
and
grown
daughters
are
natives
of
courtly
and
refined
manners
and
spend
here
days
months
and
years
of
contentment
though
they
have
never
seen
the
world
beyond
the
horizon
of
helena
on
the
of
april
the
was
again
ready
for
sea
before
going
on
board
i
took
luncheon
with
the
governor
and
his
family
at
the
castle
lady
sterndale
had
sent
a
large
early
in
the
morning
from
plantation
house
to
be
taken
along
on
the
voyage
it
was
a
great
and
i
ate
sparingly
of
it
as
i
thought
but
it
did
not
keep
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
i
ate
the
last
of
it
along
with
my
first
cup
of
coffee
at
antigua
west
indies
which
after
all
was
quite
a
record
the
one
my
own
sister
made
me
at
the
little
island
in
the
bay
of
fundy
at
the
first
of
the
voyage
kept
about
the
same
length
of
time
namely
days
after
luncheon
a
royal
mail
was
made
up
for
ascension
the
island
next
on
my
way
then
poole
and
his
daughter
paid
the
a
farewell
visit
bringing
me
a
basket
of
fruit
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
the
anchor
was
up
and
i
bore
off
for
the
west
loath
to
leave
my
new
friends
but
fresh
winds
filled
the
sloop
sails
once
more
and
i
watched
the
at
plantation
house
the
parting
signal
for
the
till
the
island
faded
in
the
darkness
astern
and
became
one
with
the
night
and
by
midnight
the
light
itself
had
disappeared
below
the
horizon
when
morning
came
there
was
no
land
in
sight
but
the
day
went
on
the
same
as
days
before
save
for
one
small
incident
governor
sterndale
had
given
me
a
bag
of
coffee
in
the
husk
and
clark
the
american
in
an
evil
moment
had
put
a
goat
on
board
to
butt
the
sack
and
hustle
the
out
of
the
pods
he
urged
that
the
animal
besides
being
useful
would
be
as
companionable
as
a
dog
i
soon
found
that
my
this
sort
of
dog
with
horns
had
to
be
tied
up
entirely
the
mistake
i
made
was
that
i
did
not
chain
him
to
the
mast
instead
of
tying
him
with
grass
ropes
less
securely
and
this
i
learned
to
my
cost
except
for
the
first
day
before
the
beast
got
his
on
i
had
no
peace
of
mind
after
that
actuated
by
a
spirit
born
maybe
of
his
pasturage
this
incarnation
of
evil
threatened
to
devour
everything
from
to
he
was
the
worst
pirate
i
met
on
the
whole
voyage
he
began
depredations
by
eating
my
chart
of
the
west
indies
in
the
cabin
one
day
while
i
was
about
my
work
thinking
that
the
critter
was
securely
tied
on
deck
by
the
pumps
alas
there
was
not
a
rope
in
the
sloop
proof
against
that
goat
awful
teeth
it
was
clear
from
the
very
first
that
i
was
having
no
luck
with
animals
on
board
there
was
the
from
the
keeling
islands
no
sooner
had
it
got
a
claw
through
its
than
my
hanging
within
reach
was
torn
to
ribbons
encouraged
by
this
success
it
smashed
the
box
open
and
escaped
into
my
cabin
tearing
up
things
generally
and
finally
threatening
my
life
in
the
dark
i
had
hoped
to
bring
the
creature
home
alive
but
this
did
not
prove
feasible
next
the
goat
devoured
my
straw
hat
and
so
when
i
arrived
in
port
i
had
nothing
to
wear
ashore
on
my
head
this
last
unkind
stroke
decided
his
fate
on
the
of
april
the
arrived
at
ascension
which
is
garrisoned
by
a
crew
and
the
boatswain
of
the
island
came
on
board
as
he
stepped
out
of
his
boat
the
mutinous
goat
climbed
into
it
and
defied
boatswain
and
crew
i
hired
them
to
land
the
wretch
at
once
which
they
were
only
too
willing
to
do
and
there
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
most
excellent
scotchman
with
the
chances
that
he
would
never
get
away
i
was
destined
to
sail
once
more
into
the
depths
of
solitude
but
these
experiences
had
no
bad
effect
upon
me
on
the
contrary
a
spirit
of
charity
and
even
benevolence
grew
stronger
in
my
nature
through
the
meditations
of
these
supreme
hours
on
the
sea
in
the
loneliness
of
the
dreary
country
about
cape
horn
i
found
myself
in
no
mood
to
make
one
life
less
in
the
world
except
in
and
as
i
sailed
this
trait
of
the
hermit
character
grew
till
the
mention
of
killing
was
revolting
to
me
however
well
i
may
have
enjoyed
a
chicken
stew
afterward
at
samoa
a
new
self
rebelled
at
the
thought
suggested
there
of
carrying
chickens
to
be
slain
for
my
table
on
the
voyage
and
stevenson
hearing
my
protest
agreed
with
me
that
to
kill
the
companions
of
my
voyage
and
eat
them
would
be
indeed
next
to
murder
and
cannibalism
as
to
pet
animals
there
was
no
room
for
a
noble
large
dog
on
the
on
so
long
a
voyage
and
a
small
cur
was
for
many
years
associated
in
my
mind
with
hydrophobia
i
witnessed
once
the
death
of
a
sterling
young
german
from
that
dreadful
disease
and
about
the
same
time
heard
of
the
death
also
by
hydrophobia
of
the
young
gentleman
who
had
just
written
a
line
of
insurance
in
his
company
books
for
me
i
have
seen
the
whole
crew
of
a
ship
scamper
up
the
rigging
to
avoid
a
dog
racing
about
the
decks
in
a
fit
it
would
never
do
i
thought
for
the
crew
of
the
to
take
a
canine
risk
and
with
these
just
prejudices
indelibly
stamped
on
my
mind
i
have
i
am
afraid
answered
impatiently
too
often
the
query
did
you
have
a
dog
with
i
and
the
dog
would
have
been
very
long
in
the
same
boat
in
any
sense
a
cat
would
have
been
a
harmless
animal
i
dare
say
but
there
was
nothing
for
puss
to
do
on
board
and
she
is
an
unsociable
animal
at
best
true
a
rat
got
into
my
vessel
at
the
keeling
cocos
islands
and
another
at
rodriguez
along
with
a
centiped
stowed
away
in
the
hold
but
one
of
them
i
drove
out
of
the
ship
and
the
other
i
caught
this
is
how
it
was
for
the
first
one
with
infinite
pains
i
made
a
trap
looking
to
its
capture
and
destruction
but
the
wily
rodent
not
to
be
deluded
took
the
hint
and
got
ashore
the
day
the
thing
was
completed
it
is
according
to
tradition
a
most
reassuring
sign
to
find
rats
coming
to
a
ship
and
i
had
a
mind
to
abide
the
knowing
one
of
rodriguez
but
a
breach
of
discipline
decided
the
matter
against
him
while
i
slept
one
night
my
ship
sailing
on
he
undertook
to
walk
over
me
beginning
at
the
crown
of
my
head
concerning
which
i
am
always
sensitive
i
sleep
lightly
before
his
impertinence
had
got
him
even
to
my
nose
i
cried
rat
had
him
by
the
tail
and
threw
him
out
of
the
companionway
into
the
sea
as
for
the
centiped
i
was
not
aware
of
its
presence
till
the
wretched
insect
all
feet
and
venom
beginning
like
the
rat
at
my
head
wakened
me
by
a
sharp
bite
on
the
scalp
this
also
was
more
than
i
could
tolerate
after
a
few
applications
of
kerosene
the
poisonous
bite
painful
at
first
gave
me
no
further
inconvenience
from
this
on
for
a
time
no
living
thing
disturbed
my
solitude
no
insect
even
was
present
in
my
vessel
except
the
spider
and
his
wife
from
boston
now
with
a
family
of
young
spiders
nothing
i
say
till
sailing
down
the
last
stretch
of
the
indian
ocean
where
mosquitos
came
by
hundreds
from
poured
out
of
the
heavens
simply
a
barrel
of
stood
on
deck
five
days
i
think
in
the
sun
then
music
began
i
knew
the
sound
at
once
it
was
the
same
as
heard
from
alaska
to
new
orleans
again
at
cape
town
while
dining
out
one
day
i
was
taken
with
the
song
of
a
cricket
and
branscombe
my
host
volunteered
to
capture
a
pair
of
them
for
me
they
were
sent
on
board
next
day
in
a
box
labeled
pluto
and
scamp
stowing
them
away
in
the
binnacle
in
their
own
snug
box
i

would
stand
a

very
soon
after
the
arrived
i
received
a
note
from
captain
blaxland
the
commander
of
the
island
conveying
his
thanks
for
the
royal
mail
brought
from
helena
and
inviting
me
to
luncheon
with
him
and
his
wife
and
sister
at
headquarters
not
far
away
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
i
availed
myself
of
the
hospitality
at
once
a
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
jetty
when
i
landed
and
a
sailor
with
a
broad
grin
led
the
horse
carefully
up
the
hill
to
the
captain
house
as
if
i
were
a
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
a
governor
besides
and
he
led
it
as
carefully
down
again
when
i
returned
on
the
following
day
i
visited
the
summit
among
the
clouds
the
same
team
being
provided
and
the
same
old
sailor
leading
the
horse
there
was
probably
not
a
man
on
the
island
at
that
moment
better
able
to
walk
than
i
the
sailor
knew
that
i
finally
suggested
that
we
change
places
let
me
take
the
bridle
i
said
and
keep
the
horse
from
bolting
great
stone
frigate
he
exclaimed
as
he
burst
into
a
laugh
this
would
bolt
no
faster
nor
a
turtle
if
i
did
tow
we
never
get
into
port
i
walked
most
of
the
way
over
the
steep
grades
whereupon
my
guide
every
inch
a
sailor
became
my
friend
arriving
at
the
summit
of
the
island
i
met
schank
the
farmer
from
canada
and
his
sister
living
very
cozily
in
a
house
among
the
rocks
as
snug
as
conies
and
as
safe
he
showed
me
over
the
farm
taking
me
through
a
tunnel
which
led
from
one
field
to
the
other
divided
by
an
inaccessible
spur
of
mountain
schank
said
that
he
had
lost
many
cows
and
bullocks
as
well
as
sheep
from
breakneck
over
the
steep
cliffs
and
precipices
one
cow
he
said
would
sometimes
hook
another
right
over
a
precipice
to
destruction
and
go
on
feeding
unconcernedly
it
seemed
that
the
animals
on
the
island
farm
like
mankind
in
the
wide
world
found
it
all
too
small
on
the
of
april
while
i
was
ashore
rollers
came
in
which
rendered
launching
a
boat
impossible
however
the
sloop
being
securely
moored
to
a
buoy
in
deep
water
outside
of
all
breakers
she
was
safe
while
i
in
the
best
of
quarters
listened
to
stories
among
the
officers
of
the
stone
frigate
on
the
evening
of
the
the
sea
having
gone
down
i
went
on
board
and
made
preparations
to
start
again
on
my
voyage
early
next
day
the
boatswain
of
the
island
and
his
crew
giving
me
a
hearty
handshake
as
i
embarked
at
the
jetty
for
reasons
of
scientific
interest
i
invited
in
the
most
thorough
investigation
concerning
the
of
the
very
few
had
challenged
it
and
perhaps
few
ever
will
do
so
henceforth
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
that
may
i
wished
to
clench
beyond
doubt
the
fact
that
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
in
the
expedition
of
a
sloop
around
the
world
to
have
more
than
one
man
for
the
crew
all
told
and
that
the
sailed
with
only
one
person
on
board
and
so
by
appointment
lieutenant
eagles
the
executive
officer
in
the
morning
just
as
i
was
ready
to
sail
fumigated
the
sloop
rendering
it
impossible
for
a
person
to
live
concealed
below
and
proving
that
only
one
person
was
on
board
when
she
arrived
a
certificate
to
this
effect
besides
the
official
documents
from
the
many
consulates
health
offices
and
customhouses
will
seem
to
many
superfluous
but
this
story
of
the
voyage
may
find
its
way
into
hands
unfamiliar
with
the
business
of
these
offices
and
of
their
ways
of
seeing
that
a
vessel
papers
and
above
all
her
bills
of
health
are
in
order
the
lieutenant
certificate
being
made
out
the
nothing
loath
now
filled
away
clear
of
the
rocks
and
the
comfortably
cool
and
bracing
sent
her
flying
along
on
her
course
on
may
she
crossed
the
track
homeward
bound
that
she
had
made
october
on
the
voyage
out
she
passed
fernando
de
noronha
at
night
going
some
miles
south
of
it
and
so
i
did
not
see
the
island
i
felt
a
contentment
in
knowing
that
the
had
encircled
the
globe
and
even
as
an
adventure
alone
i
was
in
no
way
discouraged
as
to
its
utility
and
said
to
myself
let
what
will
happen
the
voyage
is
now
on
record
a
period
was
made

on

there
was
a
great
change
in
the
condition
of
the
sea
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
my
longitude
now
if
any
had
before
existed
in
my
mind
strange
and
current
ripples
pattered
against
the
sloop
sides
in
grateful
music
the
tune
arrested
the
oar
and
i
sat
quietly
listening
to
it
while
the
kept
on
her
course
by
these
current
ripples
i
was
assured
that
she
was
now
off
roque
and
had
struck
the
current
which
sweeps
around
that
cape
the
we
old
sailors
say
produce
this
current
which
in
its
course
from
this
point
forward
is
governed
by
the
coastline
of
brazil
guiana
venezuela
and
as
some
would
say
by
the
monroe
doctrine
the
trades
had
been
blowing
fresh
for
some
time
and
the
current
now
at
its
height
amounted
to
forty
miles
a
day
this
added
to
the
sloop
run
by
the
log
made
the
handsome
day
work
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
on
several
consecutive
days
i
saw
nothing
of
the
coast
of
brazil
though
i
was
not
many
leagues
off
and
was
always
in
the
brazil
current
i
did
not
know
that
war
with
spain
had
been
declared
and
that
i
might
be
liable
right
there
to
meet
the
enemy
and
be
captured
many
had
told
me
at
cape
town
that
in
their
opinion
war
was
inevitable
and
they
said
the
spaniard
will
get
you
the
spaniard
will
get
you
to
all
this
i
could
only
say
that
even
so
he
would
not
get
much
even
in
the
over
the
disaster
to
the
i
did
not
think
there
would
be
war
but
i
am
no
politician
indeed
i
had
hardly
given
the
matter
a
serious
thought
when
on
the
of
may
just
north
of
the
equator
and
near
the
longitude
of
the
river
amazon
i
saw
first
a
mast
with
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
it
rising
astern
as
if
poked
up
out
of
the
sea
and
then
rapidly
appearing
on
the
horizon
like
a
citadel
the
as
she
came
near
i
saw
that
the
great
ship
was
flying
the
signals
c
b
t
which
read
are
there
any
about
right
under
these
flags
and
larger
than
the
mainsail
so
it
appeared
was
the
yellowest
spanish
flag
i
ever
saw
it
gave
me
nightmare
some
time
after
when
i
reflected
on
it
in
my
dreams
illustration
the
passed
by
the
i
did
not
make
out
the
signals
till
she
passed
ahead
where
i
could
read
them
better
for
she
was
two
miles
away
and
i
had
no
binoculars
when
i
had
read
her
flags
i
hoisted
the
signal
no
for
i
had
not
seen
any
spanish
i
had
not
been
looking
for
any
my
final
signal
let
us
keep
together
for
mutual
protection
captain
clark
did
not
seem
to
regard
as
necessary
perhaps
my
small
flags
were
not
made
out
anyhow
the
steamed
on
with
a
rush
looking
for
spanish
as
i
learned
afterward
the
great
flag
was
dipped
beautifully
three
times
to
the
lowered
flag
as
she
passed
on
both
had
crossed
the
line
only
a
few
hours
before
i
pondered
long
that
night
over
the
probability
of
a
war
risk
now
coming
upon
the
after
she
had
cleared
all
or
nearly
all
the
dangers
of
the
sea
but
finally
a
strong
hope
mastered
my
fears
on
the
of
may
the
coming
out
of
a
storm
at
daylight
made
devil
island
two
points
on
the
lee
bow
not
far
off
the
wind
was
still
blowing
a
stiff
breeze
on
shore
i
could
clearly
see
the
buildings
on
the
island
as
the
sloop
brought
it
abeam
no
flag
or
sign
of
life
was
seen
on
the
dreary
place
later
in
the
day
a
french
bark
on
the
port
tack
making
for
cayenne
hove
in
sight
on
the
wind
she
was
falling
to
leeward
fast
the
was
also
and
was
lugging
on
sail
to
secure
an
offing
on
the
starboard
tack
a
heavy
swell
in
the
night
having
thrown
her
too
near
the
shore
and
now
i
considered
the
matter
of
supplicating
a
change
of
wind
i
had
already
enjoyed
my
share
of
favoring
breezes
over
the
great
oceans
and
i
asked
myself
if
it
would
be
right
to
have
the
wind
turned
now
all
into
my
sails
while
the
frenchman
was
bound
the
other
way
a
head
current
which
he
stemmed
together
with
a
scant
wind
was
bad
enough
for
him
and
so
i
could
only
say
in
my
heart
lord
let
matters
stand
as
they
are
but
do
not
help
the
frenchman
any
more
just
now
for
what
would
suit
him
well
would
ruin
me
i
remembered
that
when
a
lad
i
heard
a
captain
often
say
in
meeting
that
in
answer
to
a
prayer
of
his
own
the
wind
changed
from
southeast
to
northwest
entirely
to
his
satisfaction
he
was
a
good
man
but
did
this
glorify
the
architect
the
ruler
of
the
winds
and
the
waves
moreover
it
was
not
a
as
i
remember
it
that
changed
for
him
but
one
of
the
variables
which
will
change
when
you
ask
it
if
you
ask
long
enough
again
this
man
brother
maybe
was
not
bound
the
opposite
way
well
content
with
a
fair
wind
himself
which
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
h
h
the
bishop
of
melbourne
commend
me
to
his
teachings
refused
to
set
aside
a
day
of
prayer
for
rain
recommending
his
people
to
husband
water
when
the
rainy
season
was
on
in
like
manner
a
navigator
husbands
the
wind
keeping
a
where
practicable
on
may
is
written
large
in
the
in
latitude
degrees
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
i
see
the
north
star
the
on
the
day
following
logged
one
hundred
and
miles
to
this
i
add
miles
for
current
sweeping
her
onward
on
the
of
may
about
sunset
the
island
of
tobago
off
the
orinoco
came
into
view
bearing
west
by
north
distant
miles
the
was
drawing
rapidly
toward
her
home
destination
later
at
night
while
running
free
along
the
coast
of
tobago
the
wind
still
blowing
fresh
i
was
startled
by
the
sudden
flash
of
breakers
on
the
port
bow
and
not
far
off
i
luffed
instantly
offshore
and
then
tacked
heading
in
for
the
island
finding
myself
shortly
after
close
in
with
the
land
i
tacked
again
offshore
but
without
much
altering
the
bearings
of
the
danger
sail
whichever
way
i
would
it
seemed
clear
that
if
the
sloop
weathered
the
rocks
at
all
it
would
be
a
close
shave
and
i
watched
with
anxiety
while
beating
against
the
current
always
losing
ground
so
the
matter
stood
hour
after
hour
while
i
watched
the
flashes
of
light
thrown
up
as
regularly
as
the
beats
of
the
long
ocean
swells
and
always
they
seemed
just
a
little
nearer
it
was
evidently
a
coral
reef
of
this
i
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
and
a
bad
reef
at
that
worse
still
there
might
be
other
reefs
ahead
forming
a
bight
into
which
the
current
would
sweep
me
and
where
i
should
be
hemmed
in
and
finally
wrecked
i
had
not
sailed
these
waters
since
a
lad
and
lamented
the
day
i
had
allowed
on
board
the
goat
that
ate
my
chart
i
taxed
my
memory
of
sea
lore
of
wrecks
on
sunken
reefs
and
of
pirates
harbored
among
coral
reefs
where
other
ships
might
not
come
but
nothing
that
i
could
think
of
applied
to
the
island
of
tobago
save
the
one
wreck
of
robinson
crusoe
ship
in
the
fiction
and
that
gave
me
little
information
about
reefs
i
remembered
only
that
in
crusoe
case
he
kept
his
powder
dry
but
there
she
booms
again
i
cried
and
how
close
the
flash
is
now
almost
aboard
was
that
last
breaker
but
you
go
by
old
girl
is
abeam
now
one
surge
more
and
oh
one
more
like
that
will
clear
your
ribs
and
keel
and
i
slapped
her
on
the
transom
proud
of
her
last
noble
effort
to
leap
clear
of
the
danger
when
a
wave
greater
than
the
rest
threw
her
higher
than
before
and
behold
from
the
crest
of
it
was
revealed
at
once
all
there
was
of
the
reef
i
fell
back
in
a
coil
of
rope
speechless
and
amazed
not
distressed
but
rejoiced
aladdin
lamp
my
own
lantern
it
was
the
great
revolving
light
on
the
island
of
trinidad
thirty
miles
away
throwing
flashes
over
the
waves
which
had
deceived
me
the
orb
of
the
light
was
now
dipping
on
the
horizon
and
how
glorious
was
the
sight
of
it
but
dear
father
neptune
as
i
live
after
a
long
life
at
sea
and
much
among
corals
i
would
have
made
a
solemn
declaration
to
that
reef
through
all
the
rest
of
the
night
i
saw
imaginary
reefs
and
not
knowing
what
moment
the
sloop
might
fetch
up
on
a
real
one
i
tacked
off
and
on
till
daylight
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
track
all
for
the
want
of
a
chart
i
could
have
nailed
the
helena
goat
pelt
to
the
deck
my
course
was
now
for
grenada
to
which
i
carried
letters
from
mauritius
about
midnight
of
the
of
may
i
arrived
at
the
island
and
cast
anchor
in
the
roads
off
the
town
of
george
entering
the
inner
harbor
at
daylight
on
the
morning
of
the
which
made
days
sailing
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
it
was
a
good
run
and
i
doffed
my
cap
again
to
the
pilot
of
the
lady
bruce
in
a
note
to
the
at
port
louis
said
grenada
was
a
lovely
island
and
she
wished
the
sloop
might
call
there
on
the
voyage
home
when
the
arrived
i
found
that
she
had
been
fully
expected
how
so
i
asked
oh
we
heard
that
you
were
at
mauritius
they
said
and
from
mauritius
after
meeting
sir
charles
bruce
our
old
governor
we
knew
you
would
come
to
grenada
this
was
a
charming
introduction
and
it
brought
me
in
contact
with
people
worth
knowing
the
sailed
from
grenada
on
the
of
may
and
coasted
along
under
the
lee
of
the
antilles
arriving
at
the
island
of
dominica
on
the
where
for
the
want
of
knowing
better
i
cast
anchor
at
the
quarantine
ground
for
i
was
still
without
a
chart
of
the
islands
not
having
been
able
to
get
one
even
at
grenada
here
i
not
only
met
with
further
disappointment
in
the
matter
but
was
threatened
with
a
fine
for
the
mistake
i
made
in
the
anchorage
there
were
no
ships
either
at
the
quarantine
or
at
the
commercial
roads
and
i
could
not
see
that
it
made
much
difference
where
i
anchored
but
a
negro
chap
a
sort
of
deputy
harbormaster
coming
along
thought
it
did
and
he
ordered
me
to
shift
to
the
other
anchorage
which
in
truth
i
had
already
investigated
and
did
not
like
because
of
the
heavier
roll
there
from
the
sea
and
so
instead
of
springing
to
the
sails
at
once
to
shift
i
said
i
would
leave
outright
as
soon
as
i
could
procure
a
chart
which
i
begged
he
would
send
and
get
for
me
but
i
say
you
mus
move
you
gets
all
he
insisted
and
raising
his
voice
so
that
all
the
people
alongshore
could
hear
him
he
added
an
jes
now
then
he
flew
into
a
towering
passion
when
they
on
shore
snickered
to
see
the
crew
of
the
sitting
calmly
by
the
bulwark
instead
of
hoisting
sail
i
tell
you
dis
am
quarantine
he
shouted
very
much
louder
than
before
that
all
right
general
i
replied
i
want
to
be
quarantined
anyhow
that
right
boss
some
one
on
the
beach
cried
that
right
you
get
quarantined
while
others
shouted
to
the
deputy
to
make
de
white
trash
move
out
o
dat
they
were
about
equally
divided
on
the
island
for
and
against
me
the
man
who
had
made
so
much
fuss
over
the
matter
gave
it
up
when
he
found
that
i
wished
to
be
quarantined
and
sent
for
an
who
soon
came
alongside
starched
from
clue
to
earing
he
stood
in
the
boat
as
straight
up
and
down
as
a
fathom
of
a
marvel
of
importance
charts
cried
i
as
soon
as
his
appeared
over
the
sloop
rail
have
you
any
charts
no
sah
he
replied
with
dignity
no
sah
grow
on
dis
island
not
doubting
the
information
i
tripped
anchor
immediately
as
i
had
intended
to
do
from
the
first
and
made
all
sail
for
john
antigua
where
i
arrived
on
the
of
june
having
sailed
with
great
caution
in
midchannel
all
the
way
the
always
in
good
company
now
fell
in
with
the
port
officers
at
the
harbor
entrance
having
on
board
sir
francis
fleming
governor
of
the
leeward
islands
who
to
the
delight
of
all
hands
gave
the
officer
in
charge
instructions
to
tow
my
ship
into
port
on
the
following
day
his
excellency
and
lady
fleming
along
with
captain
burr
paid
me
a
visit
the
was
tendered
free
to
me
at
antigua
as
was
done
also
at
grenada
and
at
each
place
a
highly
intelligent
audience
filled
the
hall
to
listen
to
a
talk
about
the
seas
the
had
crossed
and
the
countries
she
had
visited
chapter
xxi
clearing
for
home
in
the
calm
belt
a
sea
covered
with
sargasso
the
jibstay
parts
in
a
gale
welcomed
by
a
tornado
off
fire
island
a
change
of
plan
arrival
at
newport
end
of
a
cruise
of
over
thousand
miles
the
again
at
fairhaven
on
the
of
june
the
cleared
from
the
united
states
consulate
and
her
license
to
sail
even
round
the
world
was
returned
to
her
for
the
last
time
the
united
states
consul
hunt
before
handing
the
paper
to
me
wrote
on
it
as
general
roberts
had
done
at
cape
town
a
short
commentary
on
the
voyage
the
document
by
regular
course
is
now
lodged
in
the
treasury
department
at
washington
on
june
the
sailed
for
a
home
port
heading
first
direct
for
cape
hatteras
on
the
of
june
she
passed
under
the
sun
from
south
to
north
the
sun
declination
on
that
day
was
degrees
and
the
latitude
of
the
was
the
same
just
before
noon
many
think
it
is
excessively
hot
right
under
the
sun
it
is
not
necessarily
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
thermometer
stands
at
a
bearable
point
whenever
there
is
a
breeze
and
a
ripple
on
the
sea
even
exactly
under
the
sun
it
is
often
hotter
in
cities
and
on
sandy
shores
in
higher
latitudes
the
was
booming
joyously
along
for
home
now
making
her
usual
good
time
when
of
a
sudden
she
struck
the
horse
latitudes
and
her
sail
flapped
limp
in
a
calm
i
had
almost
forgotten
this
calm
belt
or
had
come
to
regard
it
as
a
myth
i
now
found
it
real
however
and
difficult
to
cross
this
was
as
it
should
have
been
for
after
all
of
the
dangers
of
the
sea
the
on
the
coast
of
africa
the
rain
of
blood
in
australia
and
the
war
risk
when
nearing
home
a
natural
experience
would
have
been
missing
had
the
calm
of
the
horse
latitudes
been
left
out
anyhow
a
philosophical
turn
of
thought
now
was
not
amiss
else
one
patience
would
have
given
out
almost
at
the
harbor
entrance
the
term
of
her
probation
was
eight
days
evening
after
evening
during
this
time
i
read
by
the
light
of
a
candle
on
deck
there
was
no
wind
at
all
and
the
sea
became
smooth
and
monotonous
for
three
days
i
saw
a
ship
on
the
horizon
also
becalmed
sargasso
scattered
over
the
sea
in
bunches
or
trailed
curiously
along
down
the
wind
in
narrow
lanes
now
gathered
together
in
great
fields
strange
little
and
big
swimming
in
and
out
the
most
curious
among
them
being
a
tiny
seahorse
which
i
captured
and
brought
home
preserved
in
a
bottle
but
on
the
of
june
a
gale
began
to
blow
from
the
southwest
and
the
sargasso
was
dispersed
again
in
windrows
and
lanes
on
this
day
there
was
soon
wind
enough
and
to
spare
the
same
might
have
been
said
of
the
sea
the
was
in
the
midst
of
the
turbulent
gulf
stream
itself
she
was
jumping
like
a
porpoise
over
the
uneasy
waves
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
she
seemed
to
touch
only
the
high
places
under
a
sudden
shock
and
strain
her
rigging
began
to
give
out
first
the
strap
was
carried
away
and
then
the
peak
broke
from
the
gaff
it
was
time
to
reef
and
refit
and
so
when
all
hands
came
on
deck
i
went
about
doing
that
the
of
june
was
fine
but
on
the
morning
of
the
another
gale
was
blowing
accompanied
by
that
tumbled
about
and
shook
things
up
with
great
confusion
just
as
i
was
thinking
about
taking
in
sail
the
jibstay
broke
at
the
masthead
and
fell
jib
and
all
into
the
sea
it
gave
me
the
strangest
sensation
to
see
the
bellying
sail
fall
and
where
it
had
been
suddenly
to
see
only
space
however
i
was
at
the
bows
with
presence
of
mind
to
gather
it
in
on
the
first
wave
that
rolled
up
before
it
was
torn
or
trailed
under
the
bottom
i
found
by
the
amount
of
work
done
in
three
minutes
or
less
time
that
i
had
by
no
means
grown
on
the
voyage
anyhow
scurvy
had
not
set
in
and
being
now
within
a
few
degrees
of
home
i
might
complete
the
voyage
i
thought
without
the
aid
of
a
doctor
yes
my
health
was
still
good
and
i
could
skip
about
the
decks
in
a
lively
manner
but
could
i
climb
the
great
king
neptune
tested
me
severely
at
this
time
for
the
stay
being
gone
the
mast
itself
switched
about
like
a
reed
and
was
not
easy
to
climb
but
a
purchase
was
got
up
and
the
stay
set
taut
from
the
masthead
for
i
had
spare
blocks
and
rope
on
board
with
which
to
rig
it
and
the
jib
with
a
reef
in
it
was
soon
pulling
again
like
a
sodger
for
home
had
the
mast
not
been
well
stepped
however
it
would
have
been
john
walker
when
the
stay
broke
good
work
in
the
building
of
my
vessel
stood
me
always
in
good
stead
on
the
of
june
i
was
at
last
tired
tired
tired
of
baffling
squalls
and
fretful
i
had
not
seen
a
vessel
for
days
and
days
where
i
had
expected
the
company
of
at
least
a
schooner
now
and
then
as
to
the
whistling
of
the
wind
through
the
rigging
and
the
slopping
of
the
sea
against
the
sloop
sides
that
was
well
enough
in
its
way
and
we
could
not
have
got
on
without
it
the
and
i
but
there
was
so
much
of
it
now
and
it
lasted
so
long
at
noon
of
that
day
a
winterish
storm
was
upon
us
from
the
in
the
gulf
stream
thus
late
in
june
hailstones
were
pelting
the
and
lightning
was
pouring
down
from
the
clouds
not
in
flashes
alone
but
in
almost
continuous
streams
by
slants
however
day
and
night
i
worked
the
sloop
in
toward
the
coast
where
on
the
of
june
off
fire
island
she
fell
into
the
tornado
which
an
hour
earlier
had
swept
over
new
york
city
with
lightning
that
wrecked
buildings
and
sent
trees
flying
about
in
splinters
even
ships
at
docks
had
parted
their
moorings
and
smashed
into
other
ships
doing
great
damage
it
was
the
climax
storm
of
the
voyage
but
i
saw
the
unmistakable
character
of
it
in
time
to
have
all
snug
aboard
and
receive
it
under
bare
poles
even
so
the
sloop
shivered
when
it
struck
her
and
she
heeled
over
unwillingly
on
her
beam
ends
but
rounding
to
with
a
ahead
she
righted
and
faced
out
the
storm
in
the
midst
of
the
gale
i
could
do
no
more
than
look
on
for
what
is
a
man
in
a
storm
like
this
i
had
seen
one
electric
storm
on
the
voyage
off
the
coast
of
madagascar
but
it
was
unlike
this
one
here
the
lightning
kept
on
longer
and
thunderbolts
fell
in
the
sea
all
about
up
to
this
time
i
was
bound
for
new
york
but
when
all
was
over
i
rose
made
sail
and
hove
the
sloop
round
from
starboard
to
port
tack
to
make
for
a
quiet
harbor
to
think
the
matter
over
and
so
under
short
sail
she
reached
in
for
the
coast
of
long
island
while
i
sat
thinking
and
watching
the
lights
of
which
now
began
to
appear
in
sight
reflections
of
the
voyage
so
nearly
finished
stole
in
upon
me
now
many
tunes
i
had
hummed
again
and
again
came
back
once
more
i
found
myself
repeating
fragments
of
a
hymn
often
sung
by
a
dear
christian
woman
of
fairhaven
when
i
was
rebuilding
the
i
was
to
hear
once
more
and
only
once
in
profound
solemnity
the
metaphorical
hymn
by
waves
and
wind
i
tossed
and
driven
and
again
but
still
my
little
ship
outbraves
the
winds
and
stormy
waves
after
this
storm
i
saw
the
pilot
of
the
no
more
the
experiences
of
the
voyage
of
the
reaching
over
three
years
had
been
to
me
like
reading
a
book
and
one
that
was
more
and
more
interesting
as
i
turned
the
pages
till
i
had
come
now
to
the
last
page
of
all
and
the
one
more
interesting
than
any
of
the
rest
when
daylight
came
i
saw
that
the
sea
had
changed
color
from
dark
green
to
light
i
threw
the
lead
and
got
soundings
in
thirteen
fathoms
i
made
the
land
soon
after
some
miles
east
of
fire
island
and
sailing
thence
before
a
pleasant
breeze
along
the
coast
made
for
newport
the
weather
after
the
furious
gale
was
remarkably
fine
the
rounded
montauk
point
early
in
the
afternoon
point
judith
was
abeam
at
dark
she
fetched
in
at
beavertail
next
sailing
on
she
had
one
more
danger
to
pass
newport
harbor
was
mined
the
hugged
the
rocks
along
where
neither
friend
nor
foe
could
come
if
drawing
much
water
and
where
she
would
not
disturb
the
in
the
channel
it
was
close
work
but
it
was
safe
enough
so
long
as
she
hugged
the
rocks
close
and
not
the
mines
flitting
by
a
low
point
abreast
of
the
the
dear
old
which
i
knew
well
some
one
on
board
of
her
sang
out
there
goes
a
craft
i
threw
up
a
light
at
once
and
heard
the
hail
ahoy
it
was
the
voice
of
a
friend
and
i
knew
that
a
friend
would
not
fire
on
the
i
eased
off
the
now
and
the
swung
off
for
the
of
the
inner
harbor
at
last
she
reached
port
in
safety
and
there
at
on
june
cast
anchor
after
the
cruise
of
more
than
thousand
miles
round
the
world
during
an
absence
of
three
years
and
two
months
with
two
days
over
for
coming
up
was
the
crew
well
was
i
not
i
had
profited
in
many
ways
by
the
voyage
i
had
even
gained
flesh
and
actually
weighed
a
pound
more
than
when
i
sailed
from
boston
as
for
aging
why
the
dial
of
my
life
was
turned
back
till
my
friends
all
said
slocum
is
young
again
and
so
i
was
at
least
ten
years
younger
than
the
day
i
felled
the
first
tree
for
the
construction
of
the
my
ship
was
also
in
better
condition
than
when
she
sailed
from
boston
on
her
long
voyage
she
was
still
as
sound
as
a
nut
and
as
tight
as
the
best
ship
afloat
she
did
not
leak
a
drop
not
one
drop
the
pump
which
had
been
little
used
before
reaching
australia
had
not
been
rigged
since
that
at
all
the
first
name
on
the
visitors
book
in
the
home
port
was
written
by
the
one
who
always
said
the
will
come
back
the
was
not
quite
satisfied
till
i
sailed
her
around
to
her
birthplace
fairhaven
massachusetts
farther
along
i
had
myself
a
desire
to
return
to
the
place
of
the
very
beginning
whence
i
had
as
i
have
said
renewed
my
age
so
on
july
with
a
fair
wind
she
waltzed
beautifully
round
the
coast
and
up
the
acushnet
river
to
fairhaven
where
i
secured
her
to
the
cedar
spile
driven
in
the
bank
to
hold
her
when
she
was
launched
i
could
bring
her
no
nearer
home
if
the
discovered
no
continents
on
her
voyage
it
may
be
that
there
were
no
more
continents
to
be
discovered
she
did
not
seek
new
worlds
or
sail
to
powwow
about
the
dangers
of
the
seas
the
sea
has
been
much
maligned
to
find
one
way
to
lands
already
discovered
is
a
good
thing
and
the
made
the
discovery
that
even
the
worst
sea
is
not
so
terrible
to
a
ship
no
king
no
country
no
treasury
at
all
was
taxed
for
the
voyage
of
the
and
she
accomplished
all
that
she
undertook
to
do
illustration
the
i
spray
in
the
storm
of
new
york
to
succeed
however
in
anything
at
all
one
should
go
understandingly
about
his
work
and
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
i
see
as
i
look
back
over
my
own
small
achievement
a
kit
of
not
too
elaborate
carpenters
tools
a
tin
clock
and
some
not
a
great
many
to
facilitate
the
enterprise
as
already
mentioned
in
the
story
but
above
all
to
be
taken
into
account
were
some
years
of
schooling
where
i
studied
with
diligence
neptune
laws
and
these
laws
i
tried
to
obey
when
i
sailed
overseas
it
was
worth
the
while
and
now
without
having
wearied
my
friends
i
hope
with
detailed
scientific
accounts
theories
or
deductions
i
will
only
say
that
i
have
endeavored
to
tell
just
the
story
of
the
adventure
itself
this
in
my
own
poor
way
having
been
done
i
now
moor
ship
cables
and
leave
the
sloop
for
the
present
safe

a
final
word
of
cheer
to
navigators
from
a
feeling
of
diffidence
toward
sailors
of
great
experience
i
refrained
in
the
preceding
chapters
as
prepared
for
serial
publication
in
the
century
magazine
from
entering
fully
into
the
details
of
the
build
and
of
the
primitive
methods
employed
to
sail
her
having
had
no
yachting
experience
at
all
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
the
trim
vessels
seen
in
our
harbors
and
near
the
land
could
not
all
do
as
much
or
even
more
than
the
sailing
for
example
on
a
course
with
the
helm
lashed
i
was
aware
that
no
other
vessel
had
sailed
in
this
manner
around
the
globe
but
would
have
been
loath
to
say
that
another
could
not
do
it
or
that
many
men
had
not
sailed
vessels
of
a
certain
rig
in
that
manner
as
far
as
they
wished
to
go
i
was
greatly
amused
therefore
by
the
flat
assertions
of
an
expert
that
it
could
not
be
done
illustration
plan
of
the
after
cabin
of
the
the
as
i
sailed
her
was
entirely
a
new
boat
built
over
from
a
sloop
which
bore
the
same
name
and
which
tradition
said
had
first
served
as
an
oysterman
about
a
hundred
years
ago
on
the
coast
of
delaware
there
was
no
record
in
the
of
where
she
was
built
she
was
once
owned
at
noank
connecticut
afterward
in
new
bedford
and
when
captain
eben
pierce
presented
her
to
me
at
the
end
of
her
natural
life
she
stood
as
i
have
already
described
propped
up
in
a
field
at
fairhaven
her
lines
were
supposed
to
be
those
of
a
north
sea
fisherman
in
rebuilding
timber
by
timber
and
plank
by
plank
i
added
to
her
twelve
inches
amidships
eighteen
inches
forward
and
fourteen
inches
aft
thereby
increasing
her
sheer
and
making
her
as
i
thought
a
better
ship
i
will
not
repeat
the
history
of
the
rebuilding
of
the
which
i
have
detailed
in
my
first
chapter
except
to
say
that
when
finished
her
dimensions
were
feet
nine
inches
over
all
fourteen
feet
two
inches
wide
and
four
feet
two
inches
deep
in
the

her
tonnage
being
nine
tons
net
and
twelve
and
seventy
tons
gross
i
gladly
produce
the
lines
of
the
with
such
hints
as
my
really
limited
sailing
will
allow
my
seafaring
life
having
been
spent
mostly
in
barks
and
ships

pains
have
been
spared

city
yacht
club
was
hauled
out
of
water
and
very
carefully
measured
in
every
way
to
secure
a
satisfactory
result
captain
robins
produced
the
model
our
young
yachtsmen
pleasuring
in
the
lilies
of
the
sea
very
naturally
will
not
think
favorably
of
my
craft
they
have
a
right
to
their
opinion
while
i
stick
to
mine
they
will
take
exceptions
to
her
short
ends
the
advantage
of
these
being
most
apparent
in
a
heavy
sea
some
things
about
the
deck
might
be
fashioned
differently
without
materially
affecting
the
vessel
i
know
of
no
good
reason
why
for
a
a
cabin
trunk
might
not
be
built
amidships
instead
of
far
aft
like
the
one
on
her
which
leaves
a
very
narrow
space
between
the
wheel
and
the
line
of
the
companionway
some
even
say
that
i
might
have
improved
the
shape
of
her
stern
i
do
not
know
about
that
the
water
leaves
her
run
sharp
after
bearing
her
to
the
last
inch
and
no
suction
is
formed
by
undue
cutaway
sailors
say
where
is
her
overhang
they
never
crossed
the
gulf
stream
in
a
and
they
do
not
know
what
is
best
in
all
weathers
for
your
life
build
no
fantail
overhang
on
a
craft
going
offshore
as
a
sailor
judges
his
prospective
ship
by
a
blow
of
the
eye
when
he
takes
interest
enough
to
look
her
over
at
all
so
i
judged
the
and
i
was
not
deceived
in
a
the
made
that
part
of
her
voyage
reaching
from
boston
through
the
strait
of
magellan
during
which
she
experienced
the
greatest
variety
of
weather
conditions
the
then
adopted
was
an
improvement
only
in
that
it
reduced
the
size
of
a
rather
heavy
mainsail
and
slightly
improved
her
steering
qualities
on
the
wind
when
the
wind
was
aft
the
jigger
was
not
in
use
invariably
it
was
then
furled
with
her
boom
broad
off
and
with
the
wind
two
points
on
the
quarter
the
sailed
her
truest
course
it
never
took
long
to
find
the
amount
of
helm
or
angle
of
rudder
required
to
hold
her
on
her
course
and
when
that
was
found
i
lashed
the
wheel
with
it
at
that
angle
the
mainsail
then
drove
her
and
the
with
its
sheet
boused
flat
amidships
or
a
little
to
one
side
or
the
other
added
greatly
to
the
steadying
power
then
if
the
wind
was
even
strong
or
squally
i
would
sometimes
set
a
also
on
a
pole
rigged
out
on
the
bowsprit
with
the
sheets
hauled
flat
amidships
which
was
a
safe
thing
to
do
even
in
a
gale
of
wind
a
stout
downhaul
on
the
gaff
was
a
necessity
because
without
it
the
mainsail
might
not
have
come
down
when
i
wished
to
lower
it
in
a
breeze
the
amount
of
helm
required
varied
according
to
the
amount
of
wind
and
its
direction
these
points
are
quickly
gathered
from
practice
illustration
of
the
briefly
i
have
to
say
that
when
in
a
light
wind
under
all
sail
she
required
little
or
no
weather
helm
as
the
wind
increased
i
would
go
on
deck
if
below
and
turn
the
wheel
up
a
spoke
more
or
less
relash
it
or
as
sailors
say
put
it
in
a
becket
and
then
leave
it
as
before
illustration

the
the
solid
lines
represent
the
of
the
on
starting
for
the
long
voyage
with
it
she
crossed
the
atlantic
to
gibraltar
and
then
crossed
again
southwest
to
brazil
in
south
american
waters
the
bowsprit
and
boom
were
shortened
and
the
added
to
form
the
with
which
the
rest
of
the
trip
was
made
the
of
which
is
indicated
by
the
dotted
lines
the
extreme
sail
forward
is
a
flying
jib
occasionally
used
set
to
a
bamboo
stick
fastened
to
the
bowsprit
the
manner
of
setting
and
bracing
the
is
not
indicated
in
this
drawing
but
may
be
partly
observed
in
the
plans
on
pages
and
to
answer
the
questions
that
might
be
asked
to
meet
every
contingency
would
be
a
pleasure
but
it
would
overburden
my
book
i
can
only
say
here
that
much
comes
to
one
in
practice
and
that
with
such
as
love
sailing
is
the
best
teacher
after
experience
appliances
there
were
none
the
sails
were
hoisted
by
hand
the
halyards
were
rove
through
ordinary
ships
blocks
with
common
patent
rollers
of
course
the
sheets
were
all
belayed
aft
illustration
of
the
the
dotted
lines
are
the
ropes
used
to
lash
the
wheel
in
practice
the
loose
ends
were
belayed
one
over
the
other
around
the
top
spokes
of
the
wheel
the
windlass
used
was
in
the
shape
of
a
winch
or
crab
i
think
it
is
called
i
had
three
anchors
weighing
forty
pounds
one
hundred
pounds
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
respectively
the
windlass
and
the
anchor
and
the
or
carving
on
the
end
of
the
cutwater
belonged
to
the
original
the
ballast
concrete
cement
was
stanchioned
down
securely
there
was
no
iron
or
lead
or
other
weight
on
the
keel
if
i
took
measurements
by
rule
i
did
not
set
them
down
and
after
sailing
even
the
longest
voyage
in
her
i
could
not
tell
offhand
the
length
of
her
mast
boom
or
gaff
i
did
not
know
the
center
of
effort
in
her
sails
except
as
it
hit
me
in
practice
at
sea
nor
did
i
care
a
rope
yarn
about
it
mathematical
calculations
however
are
all
right
in
a
good
boat
and
the
could
have
stood
them
she
was
easily
balanced
and
easily
kept
in
trim
some
of
the
oldest
and
ablest
shipmasters
have
asked
how
it
was
possible
for
her
to
hold
a
true
course
before
the
wind
which
was
just
what
the
did
for
weeks
together
one
of
these
gentlemen
a
highly
esteemed
shipmaster
and
friend
testified
as
government
expert
in
a
famous
murder
trial
in
boston
not
long
since
that
a
ship
would
not
hold
her
course
long
enough
for
the
steersman
to
leave
the
helm
to
cut
the
captain
throat
ordinarily
it
would
be
so
one
might
say
that
with
a
ship
it
would
always
be
so
but
the
at
the
moment
of
the
tragedy
in
question
was
sailing
around
the
globe
with
no
one
at
the
helm
except
at
intervals
more
or
less
rare
however
i
may
say
here
that
this
would
have
had
no
bearing
on
the
murder
case
in
boston
in
all
probability
justice
laid
her
hand
on
the
true
rogue
in
other
words
in
the
case
of
a
model
and
rig
similar
to
that
of
the
tragedy
ship
i
should
myself
testify
as
did
the
nautical
experts
at
the
trial
illustration
of
the
but
see
the
run
the
made
from
thursday
island
to
the
keeling
cocos
islands
hundred
miles
distant
in
days
with
no
one
at
the
helm
in
that
time
save
for
about
one
hour
from
land
to
land
no
other
ship
in
the
history
of
the
world
ever
performed
under
similar
circumstances
the
feat
on
so
long
and
continuous
a
voyage
it
was
however
a
delightful
midsummer
sail
no
one
can
know
the
pleasure
of
sailing
free
over
the
great
oceans
save
those
who
have
had
the
experience
it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
realize
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
going
around
the
globe
to
sail
alone
yet
for
once
and
the
first
time
there
was
a
great
deal
of
fun
in
it
my
friend
the
government
expert
and
saltest
of
salt
standing
only
yesterday
on
the
deck
of
the
was
convinced
of
her
famous
qualities
and
he
spoke
enthusiastically
of
selling
his
farm
on
cape
cod
and
putting
to
sea
again
to
young
men
contemplating
a
voyage
i
would
say
go
the
tales
of
rough
usage
are
for
the
most
part
exaggerations
as
also
are
the
stories
of
sea
danger
i
had
a
fair
schooling
in
the
hard
ships
on
the
hard
western
ocean
and
in
the
years
there
i
do
not
remember
having
once
been
called
out
of
my
name
such
recollections
have
endeared
the
sea
to
me
i
owe
it
further
to
the
officers
of
all
the
ships
i
ever
sailed
in
as
boy
and
man
to
say
that
not
one
ever
lifted
so
much
as
a
finger
to
me
i
did
not
live
among
angels
but
among
men
who
could
be
roused
my
wish
was
though
to
please
the
officers
of
my
ship
wherever
i
was
and
so
i
got
on
dangers
there
are
to
be
sure
on
the
sea
as
well
as
on
the
land
but
the
intelligence
and
skill
god
gives
to
man
reduce
these
to
a
minimum
and
here
comes
in
again
the
skilfully
modeled
ship
worthy
to
sail
the
seas
to
face
the
elements
is
to
be
sure
no
light
matter
when
the
sea
is
in
its
grandest
mood
you
must
then
know
the
sea
and
know
that
you
know
it
and
not
forget
that
it
was
made
to
be
sailed
over
i
have
given
in
the
plans
of
the
the
dimensions
of
such
a
ship
as
i
should
call
seaworthy
in
all
conditions
of
weather
and
on
all
seas
it
is
only
right
to
say
though
that
to
insure
a
reasonable
measure
of
success
experience
should
sail
with
the
ship
but
in
order
to
be
a
successful
navigator
or
sailor
it
is
not
necessary
to
hang
a
about
one
neck
on
the
other
hand
much
thought
concerning
the
brass
buttons
one
should
wear
adds
nothing
to
the
safety
of
the
ship
illustration
lines
of
the
i
may
some
day
see
reason
to
modify
the
model
of
the
dear
old
but
out
of
my
limited
experience
i
strongly
recommend
her
wholesome
lines
over
those
of
for
safety
practice
in
a
craft
such
as
the
will
teach
young
sailors
and
fit
them
for
the
more
important
vessels
i
myself
learned
more
seamanship
i
think
on
the
than
on
any
other
ship
i
ever
sailed
and
as
for
patience
the
greatest
of
all
the
virtues
even
while
sailing
through
the
reaches
of
the
strait
of
magellan
between
the
bluff
mainland
and
dismal
fuego
where
through
intricate
sailing
i
was
obliged
to
steer
i
learned
to
sit
by
the
wheel
content
to
make
ten
miles
a
day
beating
against
the
tide
and
when
a
month
at
that
was
all
lost
i
could
find
some
old
tune
to
hum
while
i
worked
the
route
all
over
again
beating
as
before
nor
did
thirty
hours
at
the
wheel
in
storm
overtax
my
human
endurance
and
to
clap
a
hand
to
an
oar
and
pull
into
or
out
of
port
in
a
calm
was
no
strange
experience
for
the
crew
of
the
the
days
passed
happily
with
me
wherever
my
ship
sailed
