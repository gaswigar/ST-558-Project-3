preface
the
keith
family
were
relatives
of
horace
dinsmore
and
as
my
readers
will
observe
the
date
of
this
story
is
some
seven
years
earlier
than
that
of
the
first
elsie
book
the
journey
and
that
most
season
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
were
events
in
my
own
early
childhood
the
latter
still
dwells
in
my
memory
as
a
dreadful
dream
our
family
a
large
one
were
all
down
with
the
fever
except
my
aged
grandmother
and
a
little
sister
of
six
or
seven
and
help
could
not
be
had
for
love
or
money
my
father
who
was
a
physician
kept
up
and
made
his
rounds
among
his
town
and
country
patients
for
days
after
the
fever
had
attacked
him
but
was
at
length
compelled
to
take
his
bed
and
i
well
remember
lying
there
beside
him
while
the
neighbors
flocked
into
the
room
to
consult
him
about
their
sick
ones
at
home
that
region
of
country
is
now
i
believe
as
healthy
as
almost
any
other
part
of
our
favored
land
such
a
season
it
was
said
had
never
been
known
before
and
there
has
been
none
like
it
since

a
spring

icy

exchanged
for
gentle
breezes
a
faint

of
yellow
green
on
the

now
so
brown

over

the

of
an

the
sun
now
shining
out
warm
and
bright
from
a
cloudless
sky
now
veiling
his
face
while
a
sudden
shower
of
rain
sends
the
busy
workers
hurrying
to
the
nearest
shelter
the
air
is
full
of

sounds
the
chirp
of

the
twittering
of
birds
the
crowing
of
cocks

mellowed
by
the
distance
and
in
the
streets
of
the
pretty
village
of
lansdale
down
yonder
in
the
valley
there
is
the
cheerful
hum
of
busy
life
of
buying
and
selling
of
tearing
down
and
building
up
neighbors
chatting
on
doorsteps

out
of
the
side
door
of
a
substantial
brick
house
standing
far
back
from
the
street
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
where
the
grass
is
of
a
velvety
green
spangled
with
violets
and
snowballs
and
lilacs
are
bursting
into
bloom
steps
a
slight
girlish
figure
the
face
half
hidden
under
a
broad
brimmed
garden
hat
is
not
regularly
beautiful
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
character
in
it
the
mouth
is
both
firm
and
sweet
the
lips
are
full
and
red
the
eyes
are
large
dark
and
lustrous
and
the
complexion
rich
with
the
hues
of
health
she
sends
a
quick
glance
from
side
to
side
clasps
her
hands
together
with
a
gesture
as
of
sudden
pain
paces
rapidly
to
and
fro
for
a
moment
seemingly
striving
after
then
turning
into
a
path
that
leads
across
the
garden
to
the
hedge
that
separates
it
from
another
hastens
down
it
opens
the
gate
and
passing
through
looks
about
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
but
there
is
no
one
there
and
the
girl
trips
gracefully
onward
to
the
house
a
pretty
cottage
with
porches
the
parlor
windows
were
open
and
within
a
little
lady
of
middle
age
quaintly
attired
in
a
chintz
gown
very
short
and
scant
and
made
after
a
pattern
peculiarly
her
own
was
busied
with
brush
and
duster
catching
sight
of
the
young
girl
as
she
stepped
upon
the
porch
she
called
to
her
in
a
remarkably
voice
in
here
dearie
just
step
through
the
window
i
glad
to
see
you
the
windows
opening
to
the
floor
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
obey
and
the
girl
did
so
then
stood
silent
her
lips
quivering
her
eyes
full
my
child
what
is
it
cried
the
older
lady
dropping
her
duster
to
take
the
girl
hand
and
draw
her
to
a
seat
upon
the
sofa
is
is
any
one
ill
no
no
not
that
aunt
wealthy
and
the
girl
swallowed
down
her
tears
and
spoke
with
a
determined
effort
to
be
calm
but
something
has
happened
and
mother
delegated
me
to
bring
you
the
news
you
know
father
has
been
talking
for
some
time
of
leaving
lansdale
and
this
morning
at
breakfast
he
told
us
us
children
i
mean
he
and
mother
had
talked
it
over
last
night
and
i
do
believe
she
slept
much
for
thinking
of
it
that
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
move
out
to
indiana
and
we
to
go
just
as
soon
as
we
can
get
ready
there
now
you
know
it
all
finishing
with
a
burst
of
tears
in
spite
of
herself
for
a
moment
her
listener
was
dumb
with
surprise
but
it
was
not
in
wealthy
stanhope
nature
to
witness
distress
without
an
effort
to
comfort
and
relieve
to
lose
the
society
of
this
family
who
were
her
nearest
and
dearest
relatives
would
be
a
great
grief
to
her
the
mother
marcia
keith
the
orphan
child
of
a
sister
committed
to
her
care
in
early
infancy
and
trained
up
by
her
to
a
lovely
and
useful
womanhood
was
as
a
daughter
to
her
her
boys
and
girls
as
grandchildren
to
be
loved
and
petted
and
rejoiced
over
after
the
custom
of
fond
grandparents
what
a
lonely
old
age
for
her
without
them
that
was
her
first
thought
the
next
how
to
assuage
the
sorrow
of
the
weeping
girl
at
her
side
there
there
mildred
dear
she
said
softly
stroking
and
patting
the
hand
she
held
perhaps
you
will
find
it
not
so
bad
after
all
there
must
be
a
bright
side
to
the
picture
that
we
shall
discover
if
we
look
for
it
determinately
there
will
be
new
scenes
perhaps
some
adventures
on
the
journey
yes
auntie
very
likely
and
i
often
wished
i
could
have
some
adventures
mildred
answered
dashing
away
her
tears
with
a
rather
hysterical
little
laugh
you
not
going
to
school
no
auntie
no
more
school
for
me
that
the
hard
part
of
it
for
i
do
so
want
a
good
education
well
dear
you
shall
have
books
and
your
father
and
mother
both
educated
people
will
help
you
and
who
knows
but
you
may
in
the
end
distance
your
mates
here
the
knowledge
we
gain
by
our
own
efforts
out
of
school
is
often
the
most
serviceable
the
girl
face
brightened
if
i
do
turn
out
something
worth
while
it
shall
not
be
for
want
of
trying
she
said
her
cheek
flushing
her
eyes
sparkling
then
starting
up
i
must
hurry
home
for
mother
and
i
are
going
to
work
with
might
and
main
at
the
spring
sewing
and
then
at
the
tearing
up
and
packing
aunt
wealthy
i
glad
i
old
enough
to
be
a
help
there
are
so
many
younger
ones
you
know
yes
milly
and
you
are
a
great
help
and
comfort
to
your
mother
if
if
i
could
only
learn
her
patience
but
the
children
are
dreadfully
trying
with
their
untidy
ways
their
mischief
and
noise
they
nearly
distract
me
at
times
and
before
i
know
it
i
given
somebody
a
shake
or
a
slap
or
if
not
that
a
very
uncomplimentary
piece
of
my
mind
she
added
half
laughing
half
sighing
then
with
a
hasty
she
tripped
away
her
aunt
calling
after
her
tell
your
mother
i
be
in
after
a
while
miss
stanhope
sat
where
the
girl
had
left
her
the
usually
busy
hands
folded
in
her
lap
her
gaze
fixed
meditatively
on
the
carpet
presently
she
lifted
her
head
with
a
deep
drawn
sigh
her
eye
passed
slowly
about
the
room
resting
lovingly
now
upon
this
familiar
object
now
upon
that
i
do
think
they
would
sell
for
much
she
said
musingly
the
carpet
has
been
in
wear
for
thirty
odd
years
and
the
colors
have
faded
a
good
deal
the
chairs
and
tables
are
older
still
and
so
are
the
pictures
on
the
walls
that
sampler
my
grandmother
worked
when
she
was
a
young
girl
which
was
many
years
ago
and
these
too
rising
and
going
from
one
to
another
giving
to
each
in
turn
a
little
loving
shake
and
pat
she
embroidered
and
filled
with
her
own
feathers
and
so
i
value
them
more
than
their
weight
in
gold
marcia
i
think
values
them
also
but
to
a
stranger
i
suppose
they
would
all
seem
old
dingy
and
worthless
though
to
me
they
are
real
treasures
i
a
sincere
affection
for
them
but
what
is
that
to
my
love
for
marcia
and
her
children
what
indeed
she
hastily
picked
up
duster
and
brush
gave
a
finishing
touch
here
and
there
drew
down
the
blinds
and
left
the
room
a
few
moments
later
she
might
have
been
seen
in
bonnet
and
shawl
and
armed
with
a
large
cotton
umbrella
issuing
from
her
front
gate
and
walking
briskly
toward
the
business
part
of
the
town
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
she
returned
with
a
step
a
trifle
less
brisk
and
arms
filled
with
brown
paper
parcels
she
passed
her
own
gate
and
stopped
at
keith
mildred
ran
to
open
it
why
auntie
how
you
are
loaded
give
me
your
bundles
yes
child
carry
them
in
to
your
mother
i
been
to
every
store
in
town
such
beautiful
remnants
could
help
buying
make
up
pretty
for
the
children
afraid
there
none
big
enough
for
you
dear
am
all
out
of
breath
with
walking
yes
it
too
bad
do
say
anything
more
till
you
rested
said
the
girl
leading
the
way
into
the
pleasant
family
room
hastily
laying
the
packages
on
the
table
and
drawing
forward
a
large
cushioned
rocking
chair
there
sit
down
auntie
and
let
me
take
your
things
aunt
wealthy
come
at
last
we
been
wondering
what
kept
you
said
a
handsome
matronly
but
still
youthful
looking
lady
with
a
babe
in
her
arms
coming
in
at
that
moment
and
you
been
out
shopping
i
hope
you
were
not
caught
in
any
of
the
showers
no
i
managed
to
dodge
them
sandwiching
my
walks
in
between
so
going
to
leave
lansdale
marcia
yes
auntie
and
you
that
the
worst
of
it
the
cheery
voice
faltered
over
the
last
words
and
the
bright
eyes
grew
dim
not
so
fast
marcia
who
says
that
i
to
be
left
behind
aunt
wealthy
do
you
mean
it
is
it
possible
you
could
think
of
such
a
sacrifice
cried
keith
starting
up
and
nearly
dropping
her
babe
in
her
intense
joyful
surprise
as
what
queried
the
aunt
between
a
smile
and
a
tear
marcia
i
give
up
my
home
as
you
very
well
know
but
i
have
found
a
tenant
for
it
the
minister
and
his
wife
who
are
perfectly
delighted
to
get
it
for
it
their
only
chance
for
going
to
housekeeping
and
they
be
sure
to
take
good
care
of
my
furniture
and
other
belongings
and
rented
it
just
as
it
stands
for
a
year
and
i
going
with
you
to
hoosier
land
it
be
quite
an
importation
of
buckeyes
wo
it
all
coming
in
one
lot
and
the
good
affectionate
old
soul
finished
with
a
laugh
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
three
little
ones
who
had
come
running
in
while
she
was
speaking
caught
them
to
her
bosom
kissed
and
cried
over
them
asking
are
you
glad
cyril
are
you
glad
don
and
fan
too
are
you
glad
that
auntie
is
going
with
you
there
was
a
chorus
of
shouts
of
delight
there
were
huggings
and
kissings
asking
and
answering
of
questions
and
then
things
quieted
down
a
little
and
the
children
went
back
to
their
play
cyril
remarking
as
he
shut
the
door
now
i
sha
cry
when
we
go
all
my
friends
and
colations
is
goin
along
now
to
business
said
aunt
wealthy
attacking
the
parcels
i
going
to
help
you
marcia
in
getting
your
tribe
ready
for
their
exodus
out
of
this
land
of
plenty
into
that
western
wilderness
here
are
two
or
three
dress
patterns
apiece
for
the
little
girls
these
stuff
ones
are
for
them
to
travel
in
and
i
think
they
had
better
be
made
long
necked
and
high
sleeved
do
you
keith
looked
up
with
a
slightly
puzzled
expression
then
a
light
breaking
over
her
face
for
she
was
used
to
her
aunt
transpositions
i
do
know
she
answered
dubiously
would
it
make
them
look
a
little
low
necks
and
short
sleeves
are
prettier
for
children
i
think
and
they
used
to
it
summer
coming
on
too
and
we
must
expect
warm
weather
what
route
shall
you
take
up
the
ohio
and
erie
canal
and
round
michigan
by
the
lakes
it
will
be
cool
on
the
water
yes
that
true
and
i
take
your
advice
that
right
they
be
less
likely
to
catch
cold
from
any
little
exposure
and
their
necks
and
arms
will
be
protected
from
the
sun
now
if
you
tear
off
a
skirt
i
get
to
work
i
brought
thimble
and
scissors
along
those
were
not
the
days
of
sewing
machines
and
though
garments
were
made
in
much
simpler
style
then
than
now
the
sewing
for
such
a
family
as
the
keiths
was
no
small
task
it
would
take
some
weeks
of
very
diligent
work
by
three
or
four
pairs
of
hands
to
accomplish
what
the
mother
deemed
necessary
in
the
way
of
preparing
their
wardrobe
for
the
contemplated
journey
under
the
instruction
of
her
mother
and
aunt
mildred

already
become

as
either
of
them
a
seamstress
had
been
engaged
to
assist
but
could
not
be

for
a
few
days
so
plans

yes
mother
i
beg
your
pardon
yours
too
aunt
wealthy
i
did
know
till
this
moment
that
you
were
here
mother
he
always
teasing
complained
the
younger
of
the
girls
he
says
we
have
to
live
in
wigwams
like
the
indians
and
perhaps
grow
to
be
as
black
and
ugly
as
they
are
but
they
not
black
ada
exclaimed
the
other
my
calls
red
men
well
that
worse
i
as
lief
be
black
as
red
if
you
careful
to
wear
your
sunbonnets
when
you
go
out
you
grow
to
be
either
remarked
mildred
while
keith
said
with
a
look
of
mild
reproof
rupert
my
son
was
it
quite
truthful
to
tell
your
sisters
such
things
i
was
only
making
fun
he
answered
trying
to
turn
it
off
with
a
laugh
but
blushing
as
he
spoke
innocent
fun
i
never
object
to
but
sport
is
too
dearly
bought
at
the
sacrifice
of
truth
my
boy
she
added
with
energy
one
should
go
to
the
stake
rather
than
tell
a
falsehood
though
it
were
no
more
than
to
say
that
two
and
two
do
not
make
four
mother
i
believe
you
would
he
said
gazing
with
loving
admiration
into
her
earnest
face
i
never
known
you
to
swerve
a
hair
breadth
from
the
truth
in
any
way
and
coming
close
to
her
side
and
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
i
mean
to
try
to
be
worthy
of
you
in
the
future
she
looked
at
him
with
glistening
eyes
and
dropping
her
work
took
his
hands
in
hers
for
a
moment
the
others
were
not
listening
zillah
and
ada
had
caught
sight
of
the
new
dresses
were
admiring
them
and
asking
eager
questions
of
their
aunt
and
sister
my
boy
keith
said
in
moved
tones
i
would
rather
be
the
mother
of
a
poor
hard
working
man
of
whom
it
could
be
said
that
he
had
always
been
perfectly
honest
and
true
than
of
one
who
had
amassed
his
millions
and
attained
to
the
highest
worldly
honors
by
fraud
or
questionable
deeds
or
words
remember
that
all
your
life
mother
i
will
i
have
my
father
example
to
help
me
as
well
as
yours
the
lad
replied
with
a
proud
glance
at
the
noble
kindly
intellectual
face
of
a
gentleman
who
came
in
at
that
instant
with
fan
in
his
arms
and
the
two
little
boys
gamboling
about
him
ah
aunt
wealthy
good
morning
he
said
in
a
cheery
tone
sitting
down
beside
her
putting
fan
on
one
knee
and
lifting
the
babe
who
was
laughing
and
crowing
with
delight
at
sight
of
him
to
the
other
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
that
you
are
going
to
indiana
stuart
yes
you
are
not
contented
to
let
well
enough
alone
ca
consider
it
well
enough
to
be
barely
making
the
two
ends
meet
while
a
growing
family
must
be
constantly
increasing
my
expenses
how
is
this
removal
to
help
you
it
will
cost
a
good
deal
venture
nothing
have
i
going
to
a
new
country
where
land
is
cheap
i
shall
invest
something
in
that
and
hope
to
see
it
increase
largely
in
value
as
the
town
grows
then
lawyers
are
not
so
plenty
there
but
that
some
more
will
be
needed
as
people
move
in
and
i
hope
by
being
on
the
spot
in
good
season
to
secure
extensive
practice
it
will
cost
the
sundering
of
some
very
tender
ties
he
continued
his
face
growing
grave
almost
to
sadness
but
we
are
willing
to
bear
that
for
our
children
sake
is
it
not
so
wife
and
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
that
spoke
volumes
of
love
and
confidence
yes
indeed
stuart
she
answered
with
cheerful
heartiness
i
should
have
hesitated
for
a
moment
if
i
had
been
quite
sure
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
them
but
as
you
know
i
afraid
we
can
not
give
them
as
good
an
education
there
as
we
might
here
however
we
have
now
decided
to
go
and
i
can
only
hope
for
the
best
and
do
you
know
she
went
on
with
a
smile
directed
to
the
corner
where
miss
stanhope
sat
that
since
you
left
us
this
morning
something
has
happened
that
takes
away
more
than
half
the
pain
of
the
thought
of
leaving
lansdale
no
what
may
that
be
oh
i
know
shouted
cyril
turning
a
somersault
on
the
carpet
aunt
wealthy
goin
along
aunt
wealthy
goin
along
and
then
such
raptures
of
delight
as
were
indulged
in
by
those
who
had
not
heard
the
news
before
these
were
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
the
but
when
the
blessing
had
been
asked
and
the
plates
filled
the
talk
went
on
again
though
in
a
somewhat
more
subdued
fashion
is
there
absolutely
no
danger
from
the
indians
stuart
asked
miss
stanhope
none
whatever
most
of
the
tribes
have
been
removed
to
the
far
west
all
but
one
i
think
and
that
will
probably
be
taken
soon
what
tribe
is
it
the
wottapottamies
pottawottamies
yes
father
will
we
have
to
live
in
wigwams
and
dress
in
skins
asked
ada
anxiously
no
we
have
a
house
if
it
is
only
a
and
we
carry
plenty
of
clothes
along
dey
might
det
losted
on
the
way
suggested
fan
well
pussy
i
think
we
find
some
stores
out
there
and
if
everything
else
fails
we
can
always
fall
back
on
deerskins
lansdale
was
but
a
small
town
everybody
in
it
knew
the
keiths
or
knew
of
them
and
by
the
next
day
after
their
removal
had
been
decided
upon
everybody
knew
that
many
regrets
were
expressed
and
there
were
some
offers
of
assistance
with
their
preparations
but
these
were
declined
with
thanks
with
aunt
wealthy
good
help
and
that
of
the
seamstress
already
engaged
keith
said
she
and
mildred
would
be
able
to
do
all
that
was
necessary
they
were
very
busy
cutting
fitting
and
sewing
day
after
day
from
morning
to
night
with
occasional
interruptions
from
the
little
ones
who
were
too
young
to
go
to
school
but
old
enough
to
roam
over
house
and
grounds
and
being
adventurous
spirits
full
of
life
and
energy
were
constantly
getting
into
mischief
thus
furnishing
gratis
a
change
of
works
to
mother
and
eldest
sister
who
spite
of
a
hearty
affection
for
the
young
rogues
was
often
sorely
tried
by
their
pranks
have
you
any
cord
mrs
keith
asked
the
seamstress
one
morning
yes
turning
to
her
why
what
has
become
of
it
i
had
two
or
three
pieces
here
and
that
paper
of
needles
has
disappeared
mildred
did
you
the
children
were
here
half
an
hour
ago
mother
and
i
remember
seeing
donald
peeping
into
your
basket
run
out
and
see
what
they
have
done
with
them
going
into
the
hall
mildred
stood
a
moment
listening
for
some
sound
to
tell
her
where
the
children
were
little
voices
were
prattling
in
the
garden
near
at
hand
stepping
to
the
door
she
saw
the
two
boys
seated
on
the
grass
busied
with
a
kite
rupert
had
made
for
them
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
going
nearer
makin
a
longer
tail
where
did
you
get
that
piece
of
string
no
answer
only
a
guilty
look
on
the
two
chubby
faces
oh
i
know
it
some
cord
you
took
from
mother
and
now
it
wanted
but
you
spoilt
it
entirely
why
did
you
cut
and
knot
it
so
why
said
cyril
you
see
don
was
my
crazy
man
and
i
had
to
tie
him
and
then
i
had
to
cut
the
string
to
get
it
off
i
could
untie
the
knots
oh
you
mischievous
fellows
another
time
do
you
take
things
without
leave
did
you
take
a
paper
of
needles
too
no
we
did
maybe
fan
did
mildred
went
in
search
of
fan
and
found
her
digging
and
planting
in
her
little
garden
the
empty
needle
paper
lying
near
fan
said
mildred
picking
it
up
what
have
you
done
with
the
needles
that
were
in
this
sowed
in
dis
bed
and
when
dey
drows
up
we
have
lots
an
lots
for
mother
an
you
you
silly
provoking
little
puss
needles
do
grow
show
me
where
you
put
them
ta
dey
all
round
and
round
in
de
gwond
mildred
took
up
a
bit
of
stick
and
poked
about
in
the
fresh
earth
for
a
minute
or
two
then
remarking
to
herself
that
it
was
as
bootless
as
hunting
in
a
haystack
went
into
the
house
with
the
report
of
the
hapless
fate
of
the
missing
articles
the
boys
were
there
before
her
penitently
exhibiting
the
ruined
cord
and
promising
to
do
so
no
more
we
did
fink
mother
pleaded
don
looking
up
in
her
face
with
such
a
droll
mixture
of
fun
and
entreaty
in
his
roguish
blue
eyes
that
she
could
not
refrain
from
giving
him
a
kiss
and
a
smile
as
she
answered
ah
my
boys
must
learn
to
think
and
not
take
mother
things
without
leave
now
run
away
to
your
plays
and
try
to
be
good
children
mother
i
do
think
you
a
little
too
easy
with
them
mildred
said
in
a
slightly
vexed
tone
perhaps
but
if
i
make
a
mistake
is
it
not
far
better
to
do
so
on
the
side
of
mercy
than
of
severity
i
suppose
so
i
should
like
to
see
them
whipped
then
laughingly
she
told
the
story
of
fan
doings
and
as
needles
and
cord
must
be
replaced
put
on
her
bonnet
and
sallied
forth
upon
the
errand
mildred
as
one
of
the
prettiest
most
accomplished
graceful
and
fascinating
young
ladies
of
the
place
and
belonging
to
one
of
the
first
families
was
a
good
deal
admired
and
never
lacked
attention
at
a
party
picnic
or
any
sort
of
gathering
of
the
young
people
of
the
town
as
she
left
the
store
where
she
had
made
her
purchases
spencer
hall
crossed
the
street
and
joined
her
he
was
the
only
son
of
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
place
and
because
of
his
great
expectations
looked
upon
by
most
of
the
young
girls
and
their
mammas
as
a
desirable
match
mildred
however
was
of
a
different
opinion
knowing
him
to
be
idle
vain
and
conceited
she
therefore
returned
his
greeting
rather
coldly
heartily
wishing
that
he
had
not
happened
to
see
her
or
that
something
would
occur
to
rid
her
at
once
of
his
undesirable
company
greatly
amazed
would
the
young
exquisite
have
been
could
he
have
read
her
thoughts
for
he
had
no
doubt
that
she
felt
highly
gratified
and
honored
by
his
notice
was
he
not
arrayed
in
broadcloth
suit
silk
hat
and
immaculate
kids
while
she
wore
calico
cotton
gloves
and
the
simplest
of
straw
bonnets
and
could
not
his
father
buy
hers
out
ten
times
over
his
manner
was
gracious
and
patronizing
as
he
remarked
sauntering
along
by
her
side
why
miss
mildred
can
it
be
true
that
you
are
going
to
leave
us
i
do
see
what
lansdale
will
do
without
you
it
is
quite
true
that
we
are
going
hall
she
answered
with
a
slight
curl
of
the
lip
and
i
suppose
my
father
and
mother
will
be
missed
but
i
can
not
think
that
my
loss
will
in
any
way
affect
the
prosperity
of
the
town
or
the
happiness
of
the
people
some
people
it
certainly
will
he
said
with
increased
graciousness
exerting
himself
slightly
to
keep
pace
with
her
as
she
quickened
her
steps
to
a
very
rapid
walk
we
do
want
to
lose
you
might
it
not
be
possible
to
persuade
you
to
remain
among
us
certainly
not
unless
my
parents
should
change
their
plans
and
decide
to
stay
of
which
there
is
not
the
least
probability
do
you
know
that
you
are
walking
very
fast
miss
mildred
he
said
laughing
do
let
us
slacken
our
pace
a
little
for
who
knows
when
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
walking
together
again
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
in
great
haste
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
for
your
exerting
yourself
to
keep
pace
with
me
it
is
broad
daylight
and
i
know
the
way
now
do
be
sarcastic
my
dear
young
lady
i
be
willing
at
any
time
to
make
a
far
greater
exertion
for
the
pleasure
of
your
society
but
if
we
move
so
rapidly
it
will
shorten
our
interview
considerably
i
have
already
explained
that
i
am
in
haste
there
is
much
to
be
done
in
the
few
weeks
before
we
leave
the
girl
answered
coldly
pressing
on
with
accelerated
speed
have
time
even
for
a
word
with
an
old
friend
eh
then
miss
keith
and
turning
about
in
disgust
he
sauntered
leisurely
along
in
another
direction
while
she
sped
on
her
way
as
before
is
it
possible
what
does
the
girl
mean
he
ejaculated
the
next
minute
as
on
turning
his
head
to
look
after
her
he
perceived
that
mildred
had
actually
stopped
upon
the
sidewalk
stopped
to
speak
to
a
mutual
acquaintance
a
lad
a
year
or
two
younger
than
himself
who
was
working
his
own
way
in
the
world
getting
an
education
by
the
hardest
and
helping
a
widowed
invalid
mother
for
frank
osborne
mildred
had
the
highest
respect
though
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
mere
boy
and
was
wholly
unconscious
that
to
him
she
was
the
embodiment
of
every
virtue
and
grace
that
her
words
looks
and
smiles
were
treasured
up
in
his
very
heart
of
hearts
nor
did
she
dream
how
unhesitatingly
he
would
have
laid
down
his
life
to
save
hers
had
it
been
in
danger
it
was
only
a
boy
passion
but
it
was
deep
and
strong
the
news
of
the
intended
removal
of
the
keiths
to
what
in
those
days
seemed
a
far
distant
region
had
been
a
great
shock
to
him
but
with
the
hopefulness
of
youth
he
consoled
himself
with
the
resolve
to
follow
and
seek
her
out
when
in
the
course
of
years
he
should
earn
fame
and
fortune
though
she
should
be
carried
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
his
eye
brightened
and
his
cheek
flushed
as
on
turning
a
corner
he
came
suddenly
upon
her
in
her
rapid
walk
and
she
stopped
and
held
out
her
hand
in
friendly
greeting
he
took
it
almost
reverentially
how
d
do
frank
and
how
is
your
mother
she
was
saying
her
bright
eyes
looking
straight
into
his
better
thank
you
miss
mildred
and
you
are
well
and
oh
can
it
be
true
that
you
are
all
going
so
far
away
he
asked
with
a
wistful
longing
look
yes
to
the
land
of
the
hoosiers
wild
indians
and
wolves
she
said
gayly
do
you
envy
me
i
envy
those
that
go
with
you
he
answered
sighing
you
wo
forget
old
friends
miss
mildred
no
no
indeed
frank
she
said
heartily
but
i
must
hurry
home
and
with
a
nod
and
smile
she
tripped
away
to
the
satisfaction
of
hall
who
had
jealously
watched
the
whole
interview
he
was
glad
it
had
been
no
longer
though
he
could
not
avoid
the
unpleasant
consciousness
that
more
favor
had
been
shown
to
that
pauper
than
to
himself
the
prospective
heir
to
a
comfortable
fortune

chapter
third
lessons
so
dear
so
fraught
with
holy
truth
as
those
her
mother
faith
shed
on
her
youth
now
said
mildred
taking
up
her
sewing
again
i
must
work
fast
to
make
up
for
lost
time
for
i
set
my
heart
on
finishing
this
dress
of

the
words
had
scarcely
left
her
lips
when
there
came
a
loud
crash
and
scream
from
the
hall
followed
by
a
sound
of
tumbling
and
rolling
up
sprang
mother
aunt
and
sister
scattering
scissors
thimbles
and
work
and
rushed
toward
the
scene
of
commotion
they
found
the
stairs
and
fan
who
sat
weeping
half
way
up
drenched
with
water
while
at
the
foot
were
scattered
fragments
of
a
large
pitcher
cyril
lying
among
them
half
stunned
and
with
the
blood
streaming
from
a
cut
in
his
head
don
gazing
down
upon
him
from
the
landing
and
adding
his
mite
to
the
confusion
by
screaming
oh
oh
oh

deaded
he

taking

and
holding

lips
of

a
basin
of
cold
water

her
orders

promptly
obeyed
the
wound
skillfully
dressed
fan
wet
clothes
changed
and
then
inquiry
was
made
as
to
how
it
had
all
happened
why
why

cyril

said
the
mother
caressing
him
his
intentions
seem
to
have
been
good
but
next
time
you
want
water
dears
come
and
tell
mother
or
sister
milly
there
the
morning
gone
said
mildred
as
bells
and
whistles
began
their
usual
announcement
a
full
hour
of
it
wasted
too
by
the
pranks
of
those
children
i
hope
they
finished
up
the
business
for
vain
hope
inactivity
was
impossible
to
those
restless
spirits
their
surplus
energy
must
be
worked
off
in
some
way
they
had
not
been
heard
from
for
two
hours
and
keith
had
just
remarked
that
she
feared
it
must
be
some
mischief
that
was
keeping
them
so
quiet
when
shrieks
and
wails
from
three
infantile
voices
coming
from
the
second
story
appealed
strongly
to
the
compassion
of
their
relatives
in
the
the
call
for
help
was
responded
to
as
promptly
as
on
the
previous
occasion
mother
aunt
and
sister
flew
to
the
rescue
and
on
entering
the
room
whence
the
sounds
proceeded
found
fan
locked
in
the
wardrobe
and
the
two
boys
seated
in
the
lower
drawer
of
the
bureau
which
their
weight
had
caused
to
tip
so
far
forward
that
they
could
not
get
out
without
assistance
a
chair
standing
so
near
as
to
prevent
the
bureau
from
falling
entirely
to
the
floor
had
probably
saved
them
from
a
serious
accident
but
there
they
were
bent
nearly
double
legs
dangling
vociferous
screams
issuing
from
their
throats
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
for
the
laughing
mother
and
aunt
to
lift
up
the
bureau
and
release
the
two
rogues
while
mildred
sprang
to
the
wardrobe
unlocked
it
and
took
the
sobbing
fan
in
her
arms
you
poor
dear
who
fastened
you
in
there
cyril
did
he
said
i
stealed
and
must
go
to
jail
and
and
i
was
it
would
des
tumble
over
it
shaked
so
when
i
tried
to
det
out
the
naughty
boy
cried
mildred
flashing
an
indignant
glance
at
him
as
he
and
don
crept
from
the
drawer
straightened
themselves
and
stood
up
looking
very
much
abashed
and
ill
at
ease
mother
i
do
think
cyril
ought
to
be
punished
i
did
hurt
her
he
muttered
hanging
his
head
and
i
was
goin
to
let
her
out
long
and
we
did
mean
to
tumble
the
bureau
over
did
we
don
no
it
dus
went
yight
over
its
chimed
in
the
little
brother
pease
mamma
we
doin
to
be
dood
boys
now
you
might
have
been
very
much
hurt
if
the
chair
had
not
been
where
it
was
she
said
composing
her
features
and
speaking
with
becoming
gravity
i
am
very
thankful
for
your
escape
and
you
must
never
do
such
things
again
especially
never
lock
each
other
into
a
wardrobe
or
closet
she
added
sitting
down
drawing
fan
to
her
side
and
caressing
her
tenderly
while
miss
stanhope
and
mildred
restored
the
contents
of
the
bureau
drawers
which
the
boys
had
unceremoniously
tossed
upon
the
carpet
why
mother
queried
the
jailor
because
it
is
very
dangerous
your
little
sister
might
have
been
frightened
into
a
fit
or
have
died
for
want
of
air
to
breathe
cyril
eyes
dilated
then
filled
with
tears
as
he
seemed
to
see
the
little
sister
he
loved
so
dearly
lying
before
him
white
and
cold
and
dead
i
wo
ever
ever
do
it
again
he
said
tremulously
no
you
must
be
fan
big
brave
brother
that
she
can
trust
to
take
care
of
her
and
shield
her
from
harm
i
do
believe
my
cyril
would
be
such
a
mean
coward
as
to
hurt
a
little
girl
or
anything
smaller
or
weaker
than
himself
except
for
that
naughty
think
but
i
did
hurt
her
mother
yes
my
son
you
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
he
considered
a
moment
yes
i
that
so
he
said
slowly
fan
i
tell
you
i
real
sorry
and
you
may
be
jailor
now
and
lock
me
up
in
that
wardrobe
no
no
there
must
be
no
more
such
doings
quickly
interposed
mamma
dess
i
would
do
such
sing
said
fan
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
chubby
little
hand
what
a
room
said
mildred
shutting
the
last
bureau
drawer
and
turning
to
look
about
her
every
chair
out
of
place
and
turned
on
its
side
the
bed
all
tumbled
and
bits
of
paper
scattered
over
the
carpet
pick
them
up
children
and
try
to
keep
out
of
mischief
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
must
go
back
to
my
sewing
keith
said
following
her
aunt
who
had
already
left
the
room
mildred
staid
behind
to
assist
in
setting
it
to
rights
you
naughty
children
really
i
could
almost
enjoy
spanking
you
all
round
she
exclaimed
directly
as
she
came
upon
the
fragments
of
a
delicate
china
vase
belonging
to
herself
and
a
valued
letter
from
a
friend
torn
into
bits
milly
said
cyril
solemnly
we
should
get
deaded
some
day
would
you
be
sorry
suppose
i
should
get
deaded
she
retorted
would
you
be
sorry
for
spoiling
my
pretty
things
she
was
ashamed
of
her
outburst
nevertheless
and
the
child
words
haunted
her
all
the
afternoon
it
was
evening
two
candles
burned
on
the
table
and
beside
it
sat
mildred
and
her
mother
still
busily
plying
their
needles
the
rest
of
the
family
were
in
bed
and
miss
stanhope
and
the
seamstress
had
gone
to
their
own
homes
hours
ago
my
child
put
up
your
work
for
said
keith
you
are
looking
weary
and
depressed
and
no
wonder
for
you
have
had
a
hard
day
a
busy
day
mother
but
not
so
hard
as
yours
because
i
have
had
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
while
you
have
been
stitch
stitching
from
early
morning
till
now
and
if
you
do
forbid
it
i
shall
sit
up
and
work
as
long
as
you
do
i
consider
it
one
of
the
eldest
daughter
privileges
to
share
her
mother
burdens
my
dear
girl
you
are
a
comfort
to
me
i
thank
god
for
you
every
day
the
mother
said
looking
at
her
with
dewy
eyes
and
a
beautiful
smile
but
because
you
are
young
and
growing
you
need
more
rest
and
sleep
than
i
do
so
go
daughter
and
never
mind
leaving
me
may
i
stay
a
little
longer
pleaded
the
girl
i
want
one
of
our
nice
confidential
talks
o
mother
i
am
so
disgusted
with
myself
i
was
very
angry
with
cyril
and
don
when
i
found
they
broken
that
vase
i
valued
so
because
you
gave
it
to
me
as
a
birthday
present
and
it
was
so
pretty
too
and
torn
up
that
sweet
letter
dear
miss
grey
wrote
me
just
before
she
died
indeed
i
did
know
they
had
done
such
damage
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
loss
dear
yes
mother
i
knew
you
would
be
my
loss
of
temper
though
was
worse
than
all
i
do
wish
i
knew
how
you
contrive
always
to
be
so
patient
i
afraid
it
very
often
all
on
the
outside
the
mother
answered
with
a
slight
smile
but
i
find
it
a
great
help
in
bearing
patiently
with
the
little
every
day
worries
to
think
of
them
as
sent
or
permitted
by
my
best
friend
one
who
never
makes
a
mistake
for
my
growth
in
grace
for
you
know
we
grow
strong
by
resistance
well
mother
i
am
constantly
resolving
that
i
will
not
give
way
to
my
temper
and
yet
i
keep
on
doing
so
and
i
grow
so
discouraged
and
so
disgusted
with
myself
what
shall
i
do
my
child
watch
and
pray
our
sufficiency
is
of
god
he
is
our
strength
and
do
not
look
at
yourself
try
to
forget
self
altogether
in
unto
jesus
get
your
mind
and
heart
full
of
his
lovely
image
so
full
that
there
will
be
no
room
in
it
for
aught
else
and
thus
shall
you
grow
into
his
likeness
mildred
eyes
shone
as
she
looked
up
into
her
mother
earnest
face
i
am
sure
that
must
be
the
way
she
said
low
and
feelingly
and
i
will
try
it
for
i
do
long
to
be
like
him
mother
for
he
is
indeed
to
me
chiefest
among
ten
thousand
and
the
one
altogether
lovely
oh
how
good
he
is
to
me
ejaculated
the
mother
glad
tears
shining
in
her
eyes
that
you
might
learn
thus
to
know
and
love
him
has
been
the
burden
of
my
prayer
for
you
for
each
of
my
dear
children
since
they
first
saw
the
light
they
worked
on
in
silence
for
some
minutes
then
mildred
seeing
a
smile
playing
about
her
mother
lips
asked
what
was
the
thought
that
provoked
it
a
reminiscence
of
some
of
your
infantile
pranks
her
mother
answered
laughing
you
should
be
forbearing
with
your
little
brother
and
sisters
for
you
were
fully
as
mischievous
as
they
are
before
you
could
walk
i
caught
you
one
day
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
table
set
for
tea
your
hand
in
the
sugar
bowl
your
mouth
full
and
your
face
well
besmeared
you
were
a
great
climber
and
it
was
difficult
to
keep
anything
out
of
your
way
and
as
soon
as
rupert
could
creep
he
followed
you
into
danger
and
mischief
pulling
things
about
breaking
tearing
cutting
climbing
fences
and
trees
and
even
getting
out
of
windows
on
to
roofs
besides
you
had
a
perfect
mania
for
tasting
everything
that
could
possibly
be
eaten
or
drunk
soap
candles
camphor
lye
medicines
whatever
you
could
lay
your
hands
on
till
i
was
in
constant
fear
for
your
lives
you
poor
dear
mother
what
a
time
you
must
have
had
with
us
exclaimed
the
girl
we
can
never
hope
to
repay
you
for
your
patient
love
and
care
my
child
i
have
always
felt
that
my
darlings
paid
for
their
trouble
as
they
went
along
their
love
has
always
been
so
sweet
to
me
keith
answered
cheerily
and
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoy
the
sweet
society
and
confidence
of
my
eldest
daughter
the
knowledge
that
she
has
no
secrets
from
me
i
have
not
indeed
mildred
said
heartily
as
why
should
i
knowing
as
i
do
that
my
mother
is
my
best
and
wisest
as
well
as
dearest
earthly
friend
then
recalling
the
events
of
the
morning
she
gave
a
laughing
account
of
her
interview
with
spencer
hall
if
i
could
contemplate
the
possibility
of
leaving
you
behind
it
would
certainly
not
be
in
his
care
her
mother
said
joining
in
her
merriment
and
i
am
glad
you
have
sense
enough
not
to
fancy
him
truly
i
do
not
in
the
least
though
many
of
the
girls
consider
him
a
great
catch
because
of
his
father
wealth
said
mildred
but
really
i
do
believe
he
meant
anything
and
i
felt
like
showing
him
that
i
understood
that
very
well
and
resented
his
trifling
and
would
have
been
much
better
pleased
if
he
had
been
in
earnest

park
benjamin
one
sweet
june
morning
an
expectant
group
gathered
in
the
shade
of
the
porch
of
miss
stanhope
pretty
cottage
it
consisted
of
that
good
lady
herself
and
keith
and
their
eight
children
all
attired
in
neat
traveling
costume
and
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
stage
coach
which
was
to
carry
them
the
first
step
of
their
journey
to
the
nearest
town
situate
on
the
ohio
and
erie
canal
and
park
the
new
occupants
of
the
cottage
were
there
too
and
a
few
old
neighbors
and
friends
who
had
run
in
for
a
last
keith
and
mildred
turned
now
and
then
a
tearful
lingering
look
upon
their
deserted
home
and
this
other
which
was
equally
familiar
almost
equally
dear
miss
stanhope
seemed
to
have
some
ado
to
control
her
feelings
of
sadness
and
anxiety
for
the
future
but
keith
was
in
fine
spirits
in
which
the
children
evidently
shared
very
largely
eager
to
be
off
they
moved
restlessly
about
asking
again
and
again
when
will
the
stage
come
and
kept
sending
out
reconnoitering
parties
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
its
approach
at
length
they
espied
it
and
announced
the
fact
with
joyful
exclamations
as
its
four
prancing
steeds
came
sweeping
around
the
corner
and
swaying
and
rolling
it
dashed
up
to
the
gate
the
driver
drew
rein
the
guard
sprang
from
his
lofty
perch
threw
open
the
door
and
let
down
the
steps
there
were
hurried
embraces
and
farewells
a
hasty
stowing
away
of
bags
bundles
and
passengers
large
and
small
in
the
inside
and
of
more
bulky
baggage
in
the
boot
of
the
coach
the
steps
were
replaced
the
door
slammed
to
and
amid
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
a
chorus
of
and
good
wishes
the
toot
toot
of
the

the
crack
of

they
swept
away
down
the
street
looking
in
all

their

dropped
his

in

on

of

likewise
but
mildred
had
turned
her
head
away
purposely
and
did
not
see
him
never
before
had
lansdale
put
on
so
inviting
an
appearance
or
the
surrounding
country
looked
so
lovely
as
while
they
rolled
onward
through
the
valley
and
over
the
hills
now
clothed
in
all
the
rich
verdure
of
early
summer
and
basking
in
the
brilliant
sunlight
occasionally
mellowed
and
subdued
by
the
flitting
shadow
of
some
soft
white
fleecy
like
cloud
floating
in
the
deep
azure
of
the
sky
a
few
hours
drive
took
our
travellers
to
the
town
where
they
were
to
exchange
the
stage
for
the
canal
boat
the
packet
pauline
she
lay
at
the
wharf
and
having
dined
comfortably
at
a
hotel
near
by
they
went
on
board
taking
with
them
the
luggage
brought
by
the
stage
their
household
goods
had
been
dispatched
on
the
same
route
some
days
before
here
they
were
in
quarters
only
less
confined
than
those
of
the
stage
the
pauline
cabin
being
so
narrow
that
when
the
table
was
to
be
set
for
a
meal
most
of
the
passengers
had
to
go
on
deck
to
be
out
of
the
way
all
along
the
side
of
the
cabin
ran
a
cushioned
seat
used
for
that
purpose
in
the
daytime
and
as
a
lower
berth
at
night
other
berths
being
then
set
up
over
it
all
so
narrow
that
the
occupant
could
scarcely
turn
upon
his
couch
and
the
upper
ones
so
close
to
the
ceiling
that
it
required
some
care
to
avoid
striking
the
head
against
it
in
getting
in
or
out
also
there
was
an
unpleasant
dampness
about
the
bedding
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
or
when
the
sun
was
clouded
the
deck
was
the
favorite
place
of
resort
but
there
a
constant
lookout
for
bridges
must
be
kept
and
to
escape
them
it
was
sometimes
necessary
to
throw
self
flat
upon
the
deck
not
the
most
pleasant
of
alternatives
the
progress
of
these
packets
was
so
slow
too
that
it
took
nearly
a
week
to
reach
cleveland
from
the
point
where
our
friends
embarked
but
this
mode
of
travel
had
its
compensations
one
was
the
almost
absolute
safety
another
the
ease
with
which
the
voyager
could
step
ashore
when
the
boat
was
in
a
lock
and
refresh
himself
with
a
brisk
walk
along
the
boarding
her
again
when
the
next
lock
was
reached
this
was
done
daily
by
some
of
the
keith
family
even
the
very
little
ones
being
sometimes
allowed
the
treat
when
the
weather
and
walking
were
fine
and
the
distance
was
not
too
great
passengers
were
constantly
getting
off
and
on
at
the
locks
and
the
towns
along
the
route
and
often
the
boat
was
crowded
it
was
so
the
first
night
that
our
friends
spent
on
board
babies
cried
older
children
fretted
and
some
grown
people
indulged
in
loud
complaints
of
scant
and
uncomfortable
accommodations
altogether
the
cabin
was
a
scene
of
confusion
and
the
young
keiths
felt
very
forlorn
but
mother
aunt
and
older
sister
were
very
patient
soothed
comforted
and
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
them
all
to
sleep
then
aunt
wealthy
saying
that
she
felt
disposed
to
lie
down
and
rest
beside
the
children
persuaded
keith
and
mildred
to
go
upon
deck
for
an
hour
to
enjoy
the
moonlight
and
the
pleasant
evening
breeze
with
keith
and
rupert
who
had
been
there
ever
since
supper
keith
helped
his
wife
and
daughter
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
that
led
from
the
stern
to
the
deck
and
found
them
seats
on
some
of
their
own
trunks
there
were
a
number
of
other
passengers
sitting
about
or
pacing
to
and
fro
among
the
former
a
burly
german
who
sat
flat
on
the
deck
at
the
stern
end
of
the
boat
his
long
legs
dangling
over
the
edge
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
bearded
chin
in
his
hand
gazing
out
idly
over
the
moonlight
landscape
while
wreaths
of
smoke
from
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
curled
slowly
up
from
his
lips
the
pauline
glided
onward
with
easy
pleasant
motion
all
had
grown
quiet
in
the
cabin
below
and
the
song
of
the
bullfrogs
the
dull
thud
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
the
gentle
rush
of
the
water
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
stillness
how
nice
it
is
here
exclaimed
mildred
the
breeze
is
so
refreshing
the
moonlight
so
bewitching
yes
the
country
is
looking
beautiful
said
her
mother
and
one
gets
a
good
view
of
it
here
but
i
feel
somewhat
apprehensive
in
regard
to
the
bridges
we
must
be
on
the
watch
for
them
and
dodge
in
time
we
will
said
her
husband
though
we
may
pretty
safely
trust
to
the
steersman
it
is
his
duty
to
be
on
the
lookout
and
give
timely
warning
well
we
facing
in
the
right
direction
to
see
them
remarked
rupert
but
that
dutchman
back
there
is
not
i
he
safe
enough
though
with
the
man
at
the
helm
to
sing
out
as
we
near
them
with
that
they
fell
into
talk
on
other
topics
and
thought
no
more
of
the
smoker
bridge
sang
out
the
steersman
and
down
went
every
head
except
that
of
the
german
who
sat
and
smoked
on
unmoved
bridge
the
cry
was
repeated
in
louder
more
emphatic
tones
yah
pridge
pridge
responded
the
german
straightening
up
a
little
nodding
his
head
assentingly
but
not
looking
round
bridge
sang
out
the
steersman
for
the
third
time
bridge
you
stupid
lout
dodge
or
but
the
boat
was
already
sweeping
under
and
the
bridge
taking
the
german
across
his
shoulders
threw
him
with
sudden
violence
to
the
platform
below
whence
he
rolled
over
into
the
canal
uttering
a
half
stifled
cry
for
help
as
the
water
closed
over
him
but
he
rose
again
instantly
panting
and
spluttering
and
striking
out
vigorously
for
the
boat
he
presently
succeeded
in
laying
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
the
steersman
lending
him
a
helping
hand
clambered
on
board
crestfallen
and
dripping
while
the
crowd
on
deck
seeing
him
safe
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
at
his
expense
i
loss
mein
bipe
he
said
ruefully
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
shaking
the
water
from
his
clothes
well
you
got
a
free
bath
in
exchange
and
may
be
thankful
you
lose
your
life
remarked
the
steersman
with
a
grin
next
time
i
call
out
bridge
i
guess
you
duck
your
head
like
the
rest
the
rain
had
been
falling
heavily
all
night
but
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
clouds
were
flying
before
a
high
wind
that
blew
fresh
and
cool
from
lake
erie
as
the
pauline
glided
quietly
into
cleveland
what
a
beautiful
city
exclaimed
the
young
keiths
as
they
stepped
ashore
do
let
us
walk
to
the
hotel
father
if
it
is
not
too
far
just
as
aunt
wealthy
and
your
mother
say
he
replied
taking
the
baby
from
his
wife
i
am
told
it
is
but
a
short
distance
marcia
i
will
have
our
heavy
baggage
carried
directly
to
the
steamer
which
leaves
this
afternoon
and
rupert
and
the
girls
can
take
charge
of
the
satchels
and
small
packages
the
ladies
decided
in
favor
of
the
walk
as
affording
agreeable
exercise
and
enabling
them
to
see
the
city
to
better
advantage
than
if
cooped
up
in
hack
or
omnibus
and
no
one
regretted
their
choice
they
found
the
wide
streets
so
clean
the
breeze
so
refreshing
and
exhilarating
and
enjoyed
so
very
much
gazing
upon
the
tall
elegant
looking
houses
and
the
pretty
things
displayed
in
the
windows
of
the
large
handsome
stores
after
a
good
dinner
at
the
hotel
keith
his
wife
and
older
children
went
out
for
another
stroll
about
the
city
miss
stanhope
who
insisted
that
she
had
had
exercise
enough
and
preferred
to
stay
where
she
was
taking
charge
of
the
little
ones
in
their
absence
on
the
return
of
the
pedestrians
the
whole
party
went
on
board
the
steamer
which
was
to
convey
them
across
the
lake
to
detroit
it
was
a
fine
boat
the
cabin
large
and
handsome
staterooms
on
each
side
furnished
with
berths
of
far
more
comfortable
size
than
those
of
the
canal
packets
the
table
here
was
better
too
both
in
its
appointments
and
the
quality
of
the
food
and
was
set
in
a
lower
saloon
reached
from
the
upper
one
by
a
flight
of
broad
winding
stairs
the
children
were
delighted
with
the
change
and
wanted
to
be
on
the
guards
all
afternoon
watching
the
play
of
the
great
stern
wheel
admiring
the
rainbows
in
the
clouds
of
spray
it
sent
up
looking
out
over
the
wide
waste
of
waters
at
the
islands
and
an
occasional
passing
boat
or
racing
back
and
forth
mildred
and
rupert
were
given
charge
of
the
three
little
ones
and
found
great
vigilance
necessary
to
prevent
cyril
and
don
from
putting
themselves
in
peril
of
their
lives
mildred
was
more
than
once
sorely
tempted
to
shake
the
young
rogues
who
gave
her
no
peace
but
remembering
and
acting
upon
her
mother
advice
was
able
to
restrain
herself
and
treat
them
with
uniform
gentleness
she
felt
rewarded
when
as
she
was
putting
them
to
bed
her
mother
being
busy
with
the
babe
don
threw
his
arms
impulsively
round
her
neck
and
kissing
her
again
and
again
said
i
loves
you
milly
you
so
dood
to
us
naughty
chillens
that
she
is
assented
cyril
heartily
an
i
wish
i
did
be
so
bad
well
try
again
to
be
ever
so
good
mildred
answered
tucking
them
in
and
leaving
them
with
a
kiss
she
helped
her
sisters
with
their
preparations
for
the
night
then
was
rewarded
with
a
delightful
evening
spent
with
the
older
members
of
the
family
in
the
open
air
looking
out
upon
the
beautiful
wide
expanse
of
waters
now
starlit
and
anon
illumined
by
the
silvery
rays
of
the
moon
as
she
rose
apparently
from
the
distant
eastern
edge
of
the
lake
and
slowly
ascended
the
azure
vault
of
the
heavens
now
shining
resplendently
and
again
veiling
her
fair
face
for
a
moment
with
a
thin
floating
cloud
the
next
morning
the
steamer
lay
at
anchor
in
detroit
harbor
and
our
friends
left
her
for
a
hotel
in
what
was
then
the
principal
street
of
the
city
here
too
they
walked
out
to
view
the
land
and
passing
the
stores
and
public
buildings
found
streets
and
handsome
residences
with
pretty
in
front
keith
gave
his
children
their
choice
of
passing
around
the
lakes
in
a
steamer
or
in
the
sloop
queen
charlotte
they
chose
the
latter
and
the
next
morning
the
family
and
their
luggage
were
transferred
to
her
decks
the
ladies
pointed
out
the
articles
they
wished
carried
to
their
staterooms
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
bearers
there
was
less
of
show
here
than
on
the
steamer
they
had
left
but
comfort
and
convenience
had
not
been
overlooked
and
though
face
clouded
a
little
it
brightened
again
in
a
moment
as
she
noted
the
cheerful
content
in
those
of
her
mother
and
aunt
they
hurried
on
deck
again
where
rupert
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
younger
children
to
watch
the
vessel
getting
under
way
they
were
lying
close
to
a
steamer
on
whose
other
side
was
a
second
sloop
in
quite
as
close
proximity
all
seemed
hurry
and
bustle
on
board
the
three
i
do
see
how
we
are
to
start
observed
mildred
glancing
up
at
the
sails
which
hung
almost
motionless
on
the
masts
for
there
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
do
you
see
that
they
lashing
us
and
the
milwaukee
yonder
fast
to
the
steamboat
one
on
each
side
said
rupert
she
to
tow
both
till
the
wind
gets
up
oh
is
that
the
way
she
have
hard
work
to
do
it
i
should
think
she
wo
growl
any
way
no
i
suppose
not
which
is
the
captain
that
nice
jolly
looking
chap
over
yonder
that
giving
orders
in
such
a
loud
peremptory
tone
is
captain
wells
master
of
the
ship
that
blue
eyed
brown
haired
rosy
cheeked
stripling
standing
near
is
his
son
edward
wells
and
they
both
english
so
do
remind
them
that
this
vessel
was
taken
from
the
british
in
the
last
war
of
course
not
unless
they
say
something
mean
or
exasperating
about
washington
or
america
in
that
case
i
give
you
leave
to
twit
as
hard
as
you
like
who
was
that
nice
looking
man
that
helped
us
on
board
i
thought
father
or
somebody
called
him
captain
so
he
is
captain
jones
but
acting
as
first
mate
here
that
lady
talking
to
mother
and
aunt
wealthy
is
his
wife
they
both
yankees
so
you
can
relieve
your
mind
occasionally
on
the
subject
of
the
ship
by
a
little
private
exultation
with
them
do
you
notice
the
contrast
between
those
two
faces
mother
and
jones
hers
so
dark
mother
so
beautifully
fair
and
rosy
who
could
help
noticing
it
rupert
i
do
think
our
mother
has
just
the
loveliest
face
in
the
world
ditto
he
said
gazing
at
her
with
a
world
of
filial
love
pride
and
chivalric
admiration
in
his
handsome
eyes
i
say
what
the
use
you
may
just
as
well
set
still
where
you
hare
growled
a
voice
near
at
hand
the
young
people
turned
involuntarily
at
the
sound
and
perceived
that
the
speaker
was
a
burly
young
englishman
the
one
so
politely
and
kindly
addressed
a
little
woman
of
the
same
nationality
with
a
chalky
complexion
and
washed
out
appearance
generally
who
as
they
afterward
learned
and
suspected
at
the
time
was
the
wife
of
his
bosom
a
bear
exclaimed
rupert
in
an
aside
to
his
sister
and
drawing
her
away
as
he
spoke
see
we
beginning
to
move
let
go
over
to
the
other
side
where
we
can
have
a
better
view
i
presume
that
what
she
wanted
to
do
remarked
mildred
glancing
back
at
the
woman
and
why
should
he
have
let
her
why
indeed
except
that
he
a
cowardly
bully
how
do
you
know
because
that
the
only
kind
of
man
that
would
speak
so
to
a
decent
woman

question
of
despair

my
child
and
echo
answers
byron
how
did
you
learn
all
you
been
telling
me
asked
mildred
as
they
stood
side
by
side
watching
with
interest
the
queen
charlotte
and
her
consorts
slowly
clearing
the
harbor
oh
easily
enough
young
wells
and
i
got
into
talk
while
you
and
the
others
were
down
in
the
cabin
i
asked
questions
and
he
answered
ah
here
he
comes
he
added
looking
round
i
introduce
him
for
he
a
nice
fellow
i
sure
and
it
a
good
thing
to
have
a
friend
at
court
in
other
words
to
be
in
favor
with
the
reigning
powers
the
captain
and
his
nearest
of
kin
my
sister
miss
mildred
keith
mr
wells
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
said
the
young
sailor
gallantly
lifting
his
hat
and
bowing
low
hope
you
enjoy
your
voyage
on
the
queen
charlotte
shall
be
most
happy
to
do
all
i
can
to
make
the
trip
pleasant
to
you
thank
you
kindly
he
began
at
once
by
finding
comfortable
seats
for
them
where
they
were
sheltered
from
the
sun
and
had
a
good
view
of
the
canada
and
michigan
shores
and
being
acquainted
with
the
localities
and
their
history
and
possessed
of
a
ready
command
of
language
he
added
much
to
the
interest
of
the
scene
by
the
information
he
imparted
sometimes
unsolicited
at
others
in
answer
to
questions
when
they
had
passed
through
detroit
river
and
so
far
out
into
lake
clair
that
little
could
be
seen
but
water
and
sky
he
offered
to
show
them
over
the
vessel
they
gladly
accepted
enjoyed
the
tour
and
when
it
was
over
rejoined
the
rest
of
their
party
just
as
the
cabin
passengers
were
summoned
to
the
supper
table
mildred
was
seated
between
rupert
and
edward
wells
opposite
them
sat
and
sims
the
bullying
englishman
and
his
wife
and
a
bachelor
gentleman
of
pleasing
countenance
and
manners
whom
captain
wells
addressed
as
carr
next
them
were
captain
and
jones
there
were
many
more
passengers
of
both
sexes
several
nationalities
and
a
variety
of
ages
from
infants
in
arms
up
to
hoary
headed
grandparents
but
with
most
of
them
our
story
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
the
two
captains
the
wife
of
the
one
and
the
son
of
the
other
were
polite
and
genial
the
fare
was
excellent
and
every
one
present
seemed
disposed
to
contentment
and
good
humor
except
sims
who
turned
up
his
nose
at
the
food
snubbed
his
wife
and
scowled
at
his
opposite
neighbors
perchance
reading
too
plainly
in
the
frank
youthful
countenances
their
disapproval
of
him
mildred
so
compassionated
the
wife
that
in
the
course
of
the
evening
seeing
her
sitting
by
herself
and
looking
sad
and
lonely
she
drew
near
and
opened
a
conversation
sims
responded
readily
do
sit
down
miss
she
said
making
room
for
mildred
by
her
side
so
glad
to
some
one
to
speak
to
for
i
gets
hawful
at
times
ah
that
must
be
a
very
trying
feeling
mildred
said
compassionately
i
know
nothing
of
it
myself
for
i
never
been
away
from

or

a
week

in
england
yes
miss
hevery
one
i
left
all
father
mother
brothers
and
sisters
for
she
answered
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
and
wiping
her
eyes
furtively
what
a
shame
he
should
treat
you
as
he
does
was
the
indignant
exclamation
that
rose
to
mildred
lips
but
she
checked
herself
in
time
and
changed
it
for
then
i
think
he
ought
to
be
very
good
to
you
i
we
be
miss
when
we
settled
down
in
a
of
our
own
remarked
the
little
woman
with
a
half
stifled
patient
sigh
and
indeed
it
not
so
bad
as
i
expected
i
been
hastonished
at
finding
so
many
white
women
in
america
i
thought
when
i
landed
in
new
york
i
be
the
honly
white
woman
there
i
all
the
rest
would
be
injuns
or
niggers
indeed
how
relieved
you
must
have
been
on
discovering
your
mistake
remarked
mildred
demurely
while
her
eyes
twinkled
with
suppressed
fun
that
i
was
miss
as
you
may
well
believe
it
quite
reconciled
me
to
the
country
the
sun
rose
brightly
the
next
morning
and
the
young
keiths
were
early
on
deck
romping
and
racing
about
fall
of
the
vivacity
and
mirth
usually
incident
to
extreme
youth
and
perfect
health
they
were
well
watched
over
by
their
father
mildred
and
rupert
or
there
is
no
knowing
what
wild
and
dangerous
pranks
might
have
been
indulged
in
by
cyril
and
don
the
former
actually
proposed
a
flying
leap
from
the
deck
of
the
queen
charlotte
to
that
of
the
steamer
and
was
not
at
all
pleased
by
the
decided
veto
put
upon
it
by
his
father
i
think
you
might
let
a
fellow
try
papa
he
grumbled
it
would
be
such
fun
and
i
know
i
could
do
it
no
you
couldna
said
don
peeping
over
the
ship
side
it
a
big
big
place
come
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
and
stay
there
said
keith
leading
them
away
rupert
followed
holding
fan
by
the
hand
what
was
that
what
were
they
throwing
in
he
asked
stopping
suddenly
at
a
sound
as
of
a
heavy
body
plunging
into
the
water
while
at
the
same
instant
a
startled
cry
came
from
the
deck
of
the
milwaukee
a
man
overboard
a
man
overboard
the
fearful
cry
was
taken
up
and
repeated
on
all
sides
amid
the
rush
of
many
feet
and
the
quick
sharp
imperative
words
of
command
almost
instantly
a
boat
was
lowered
and
strong
arms
were
pulling
with
swift
vigorous
strokes
for
the
spot
already
left
far
behind
where
the
splash
of
the
falling
body
had
been
heard
and
keen
eyes
were
eagerly
searching
the
waste
of
waters
the
crews
and
passengers
of
the
three
vessels
crowding
the
decks
and
following
their
movements
in
breathless
anxiety
and
suspense
they
pulled
backward
and
forward
calling
out
to
the
drowning
one
that
help
was
near
ah
yonder
he
is
at
last
cries
a
woman
voice
in
exultant
tones
there
he
is
with
his
head
above
water
for
i
see
his
hat
and
they
see
him
too
and
are
pulling
toward
him
with
all
their
might
ah
they
up
with
him
they
have
him
now
hurrah
and
a
wild
cheer
rose
from
hundreds
of
throats
but
it
died
away
in
a
groan
it
was
his
hat
only
his
hat
poor
fellow
and
they
given
it
up
and
are
coming
back
without
him
sighs
the
woman
who
had
been
the
first
to
raise
the
alarm
every
face
wears
a
look
of
sadness
for
the
few
moments
of
silent
waiting
as
the
rowers
slowly
return
they
gain
the
deck
of
the
milwaukee
one
of
them
a
lad
of
nineteen
or
twenty
a
rough
hardy
sailor
comes
forward
with
a
subdued
manner
in
strange
contrast
to
his
accustomed
rude
hilarity
lips
white
and
quivering
tears
in
his
manly
eyes
mother
mother
he
says
low
and
huskily
drawing
near
this
woman
with
tottering
steps
do
do
take
it
too
hard
i
i
could
bear
to
see
you
i
did
my
best
we
all
did
but
we
could
find
him
and
his
hat
it
it
was
little
billy
my
boy
mine
my
little
one
she
shrieked
and
fell
fainting
into
the
arms
of
her
elder
son
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
among
the
spectators
and
as
the
sad
story
spread
to
the
other
vessels
many
a
tremulous
tone
and
falling
tear
attested
the
pity
and
sympathy
of
those
who
told
the
tale
and
those
who
listened
to
it
but
how
did
it
happen
queried
one
and
another
and
the
answer
was
he
was
jumping
back
and
forth
from
one
vessel
to
another
and
fell
in
between
the
milwaukee
and
the
steamer
and
it
is
conjectured
that
he
must
have
been
struck
by
the
wheel
as
he
did
not
come
up
again
and
it
might
have
been
one
of
ours
sobbed
keith
clasping
her
babe
to
her
breast
while
her
eye
glanced
from
one
to
another
of
her
darlings
ah
how
frightened
i
was
when
i
heard
the
cry
i
do
know
how
i
got
up
the
cabin
steps
for
i
thought
it
was
perhaps
tears
choked
her
utterance
tears
of
mingled
gratitude
for
herself
and
sorrow
for
the
bereaved
mother
yes
it
might
have
been
you
cyril
or
don
and
think
how
poor
heart
would
have
been
broken
and
mine
too
keith
added
sitting
down
and
taking
one
on
each
knee
now
do
you
want
to
try
jumping
across
like
that
boy
did
they
shook
their
heads
gazing
up
into
his
face
with
countenances
the
sad
event
of
the
morning
seemed
to
have
exerted
a
subduing
influence
upon
all
the
passengers
it
was
a
very
quiet
day
on
board
the
calm
continued
throughout
the
day
but
a
breeze
sprang
up
in
the
night
and
the
vessels
parted
company
by
daylight
the
breeze
had
stiffened
into
a
wind
that
made
the
lake
very
rough
the
ship
tossed
about
on
the
waves
with
a
motion
by
no
means
agreeable
to
the
land
lubbers
in
her
cabin
and
steerage
everything
not
made
fast
to
floor
or
walls
went
dashing
and
rolling
from
side
to
side
of
stateroom
or
saloon
few
of
the
passengers
cared
to
breakfast
and
those
who
made
the
attempt
had
to
do
so
under
serious
difficulties
table
and
floor
being
both
inclined
planes
sloping
now
in
one
direction
now
in
another
they
passed
a
miserable
day
confined
to
the
cabin
for
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
and
the
great
waves
would
now
and
then
sweep
across
the
deck
still
the
captain
assured
them
the
storm
was
not
a
bad
one
and
they
were
in
no
danger
by
the
next
day
it
had
abated
so
that
they
could
seek
the
outer
air
going
about
without
experiencing
much
difficulty
in
preserving
the
centre
of
gravity
and
nearly
every
one
had
so
far
recovered
from
the
deathly
as
to
be
able
to
appear
at
meals
life
on
shipboard
which
had
seemed
quite
dreadful
during
the
long
hours
of
the
storm
became
very
tolerable
again
the
older
people
promenaded
the
deck
or
sat
there
with
book
or
work
or
merely
chatting
and
looking
out
upon
the
restless
waters
while
the
children
amused
themselves
with
their
plays
or
in
running
about
exploring
every
nook
and
cranny
and
making
acquaintance
with
the
sailors
who
seemed
to
enjoy
their
innocent
prattle
and
merry
ways
all
the
keiths
had
suffered
from
and
mildred
was
among
the
last
to
recover
it
was
not
until
towards
sunset
of
the
second
day
that
she
could
be
induced
to
leave
her
berth
and
allow
her
father
to
assist
her
up
the
cabin
stairs
to
the
deck
here
a
couch
had
been
prepared
for
her
and
the
loving
hands
of
mother
and
aunt
busied
themselves
in
making
her
comfortable
brothers
and
sisters
gathered
rejoicingly
around
jones
brought
a
glass
of
lemonade
sims
offered
smelling
salts
some
one
else
a
fan
and
presently
the
two
captains
and
young
wells
came
up
to
offer
their
congratulations
on
her
recovery
then
cyril
and
don
led

the

prancing

while

little

with
laughter

delight

ada

his
good
nature
do
let

trouble
you
keith
he
is
surely

take
care
of
himself
besides
it
quite
evident
that
he
enjoys
their
society
as
much
as
they
do
his
said
edward
wells
taking
a
seat
near
couch
where
he
remained
chatting
in
a
lively
strain
with
her
and
the
other
ladies
until
it
was
time
for
them
to
retire
to
the
cabin
fair
weather
and
favorable
winds
made
the
remaining
days
of
the
voyage
a
pleasure
till
one
bright
june
morning
they
entered
the
straits
of
mackinaw
and
reaching
the
island
of
the
same
name
anchored
in
front
of
its
fort
the
captain
informing
his
passengers
that
the
ship
would
lie
there
for
a
day
or
two
offered
to
take
ashore
any
or
all
who
would
like
to
go
nearly
everybody
eagerly
accepted
the
boats
put
off
from
the
ship
each
with
a
full
complement
of
passengers
whom
they
landed
just
under
the
white
walls
of
the
fortress
situate
on
a
bluff
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
passing
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
they
entered
the
parade
ground
it
was
smooth
hard
and
clean
as
a
well
swept
floor
they
walked
across
and
about
it
viewing
the
officers
quarters
on
the
outside
and
the
barracks
of
the
men
walked
along
by
the
wall
noting
how
it
commanded
the
harbor
and
the
village
of
mackinaw
with
its
great
guns
beside
each
of
which
lay
a
pile
of
black
balls
heaped
up
in
pyramidal
form
then
they
visited
the
town
saw
some
indians
and
bought
curious
little
bark
baskets
ornamented
with
porcupine
quills
blue
red
and
white
and
filled
with
maple
sugar
moccasins
too
made
of
soft
skins
and
heavily
trimmed
with
bead
work
all
manufactured
by
the
indians
the
young
keiths
were
made
happy
with
a
pair
of
moccasins
apiece
from
their
father
bark
baskets
from
their
mother
and
aunt
and
unlimited
maple
sugar
from
their
friend
carr
they
returned
to
the
ship
tired
but
full
of
content
they
were
as
usual
early
on
deck
the
next
morning
a
little
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
for
they
liked
to
see
him
come
up
out
of
the
water
how
very
still
it
is
hardly
a
breath
of
air
stirring
mildred
was
saying
to
her
father
as
edward
wells
drew
near
the
little
group
all
standing
together
looking
eagerly
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
bright
face
yes
we
are
becalmed
said
keith
and
very
possibly
may
be
detained
here
for
several
days
in
consequence
added
edward
greeting
them
with
a
cheerful
in
that
case
we
will
have
an
opportunity
to
explore
the
island
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
your
guide
in
so
doing
do
you
mean
all
of
us
queried
cyril
yes
my
man
if
you
will
all
go
answered
the
sailor
lad
but
the
glance
of
his
eye
seemed
to
extend
the
invitation
to
mildred
in
particular
o
father
can
we
can
we
chorused
the
children
we
will
see
he
said
now
watch
or
you
miss
the
sight
we
left
our
beds
so
early
for
the
matter
was
under
discussion
at
the
breakfast
table
and
afterward
and
it
was
decided
that
all
might
go
ashore
but
that
the
walk
under
contemplation
was
too
long
for
the
little
ones
ada
keith
was
the
youngest
of
that
family
who
was
permitted
to
go
but
others
joined
them
and
edward
found
himself
at
the
head
of
quite
a
party
of
explorers
ada
came
back
looking
heated
weary
and
troubled
o
mother
she
cried
with
tears
in
her
eyes
we
saw
a
cave
where
some
frenchmen
were
hiding
from
the
indians
and
got
smoked
to
death
the
indians
did
it
by
building
a
fire
at
the
cave
mouth
because
they
could
get
at
them
to
kill
them
some
other
way
oh
i
so
afraid
of
the
savages
do
persuade
father
to
take
us
all
back
to
ohio
again
the
mother
soothed
and
comforted
the
frightened
child
with
caresses
and
assurances
of
the
present
peaceable
disposition
of
the
indians
and
at
length
succeeded
in
so
far
banishing
her
fears
that
she
was
willing
to
proceed
upon
her
journey
however
the
calm
continuing
nearly
a
week
passed
and
many
excursions
had
been
made
to
the
island
before
they
could
quit
its
harbor
at
length
one
day
directly
after
dinner
a
favorable
wind
having
sprung
up
the
good
ship
weighed
anchor
and
pursuing
her
westward
course
passed
out
of
the
straits
into
lake
michigan
all
night
she
flew
before
the
wind
and
when
our
friends
awoke
the
following
morning
she
rode
safely
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
of
chicago
though
a
large
city
now
it
was
then
a
town
of
less
than
five
thousand
inhabitants
this
was
the
port
of
the
queen
charlotte
and
her
passengers
must
be
landed
her
cargo
discharged
it
was
with
feelings
of
regret
on
both
sides
that
her
officers
and
the
keiths
parted
edward
wells
taking
an
opportunity
to
say
in
an
undertone
to
mildred
that
he
hoped
they
would
sometime
meet
again
joseph
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
was
the
next
port
whither
the
keiths
were
bound
a
much
smaller
vessel
carried
them
across
they
had
a
rough
passage
wind
and
rain
compelling
them
to
keep
closely
housed
in
a
little
confined
cabin
and
were
glad
to
reach
the
town
of
joseph
though
they
found
it
but
a
dreary
spot
no
grass
no
trees
the
hotel
a
large
two
story
building
with
the
hot
summer
sun
streaming
in
through
its
windows
without
hindrance
from
curtain
or
blind
for
the
rain
ceased
about
the
time
of
their
arrival
and
the
sun
shone
out
with
fervid
heat
during
the
two
or
three
days
that
they
were
detained
there
resting
the
sabbath
day
and
awaiting
the
arrival
of
their
household
goods
before
ascending
the
joseph
river
on
which
pleasant
plains
their
final
destination
was
situated
there
were
no
railroads
in
that
part
of
the
country
then
nor
for
many
years
after
i
think
there
was
no
stage
route
between
the
two
places
there
were
no
steamers
on
the
river
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
take
a
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
rippling
dancing
waters
of
the
lake
and
river
on
the
little
town
and
the
green
fields
and
forests
of
the
adjacent
country
as
they
went
on
board
the
mary
ann
and
set
out
upon
this
the
last
stage
of
their
long
journey
the
boatmen
toiled
at
their
oars
and
the
mary
ann
moved
slowly
on
against
the
current
slowly
enough
to
give
our
travelers
abundance
of
time
to
take
in
the
beauties
of
the
scenery
which
they
the
older
ones
at
least
did
not
fail
to
do
much
of
it
was
unbroken
forest
but
they
passed
sometimes
a
solitary
clearing
with
its
lonely
log
cabin
sometimes
a
little
village
the
river
flowed
swiftly
along
clear
and
sparkling
between
banks
now
low
now
high
green
to
the
water
edge
the
sun
was
nearing
the
western
horizon
as
at
last
the
boat
was
run
in
close
to
shore
and
made
fast
with
the
announcement
here
we
are
strangers
this
here
the
town
of
pleasant
plains

nor
need
we

or
splendor
wide
hall
or
lordly
dome
the
good
the
true
the
tender
these
form
the
wealth
of
home
hale
pleasant
plains
considered
itself
quite
a
town
it
stood
high
above
the
river
on
two
plains
the
upper
familiarly
known
as
the
bluff
it
was
laid
out
in
very
wide
straight
streets
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
there
were
perhaps
two
hundred
dwelling
houses
principally
frame
but
with
a
goodly
proportion
of
log
cabins
and
a
respectable
sprinkling
of
brick
buildings
the
county
seat
it
had
its
and
jail
there
were
some
half
dozen
stores
where
almost
everything
could
be
had
from
dress
goods
to
butter
and
eggs
and
from
a
plowshare
to
a
fine
cambric
needle
two
taverns
as
many
blacksmith
shoemaker
and
carpenter
shops
a
flouring
mill
and
a
bakery
also
two
churches
belonging
to
different
denominations
both
frame
structures
of
extremely
plain
and
unpretentious
architecture
with
bare
walls
uncurtained
windows
rough
uncarpeted
floors
and
rude
hard
benches
in
lieu
of
pews
no
thought
of
architectural
beauty
or
even
of
comfort
and
convenience
beyond
that
of
mere
protection
from
the
weather
seemed
to
have
entered
the
minds
of
any
of
the
builders
here
the
houses
were
mere
shells
with
no
cupboards
or
closets
or
the
slightest
attempt
at
ornamentation
nor
was
their
unsightliness
concealed
by
vines
trees
or
shrubbery
almost
every
one
of
the
beautiful
monarchs
of
the
forest
once
adorning
the
locality
had
been
ruthlessly
felled
and
a
stump
here
and
there
was
all
that
was
left
to
tell
of
their
former
existence
as
the
keel
of
the
mary
ann
grated
on
the
gravelly
shore
a
tall
figure
in
rough
farmer
attire
came
springing
down
the
bank
calling
out
in
tones
of
unfeigned
joy
hello
keith
come
at
last
wife
children
and
all
eh
i
glad
to
see
ye
never
was
more
delighted
in
my
life
and
the
speaker
catching
keith
hand
in
his
shook
it
with
hearty
good
will
then
treating
the
rest
of
the
party
in
like
manner
as
with
his
and
keith
assistance
each
in
turn
stepped
from
the
boat
george
ward
was
an
old
client
and
friend
of
keith
who
had
been
long
urging
this
removal
i
declare
i
wish
i
lived
in
town
for
a
few
days
now
he
went
on
but
we
three
mile
out
on
the
prairie
as
you
know
keith
i
have
my
team
here
though
and
if
you
like
to
pile
into
the
wagon
all
of
you
take
you
home
with
me
as
it
is
the
hospitable
invitation
was
declined
with
thanks
there
are
quite
too
many
of
us
ward
keith
said
smilingly
and
we
want
to
get
into
a
house
of
our
own
just
as
soon
as
possible
ah
yes
so
your
husband
wrote
me
and
i
been
looking
round
for
you
but
the
best
that
to
be
had
will
seem
a
poor
place
to
you
keith
after
what
you
left
behind
in
lansdale
i
suppose
so
but
of
course
we
must
expect
to
put
up
with
many
inconveniences
and
probably
some
hardships
even
for
the
first
few
years
she
answered
cheerfully
i
afraid
that
so
but
i
hope
you
find
yourselves
paid
for
it
in
the
long
run
now
shall
i
take
you
to
the
union
hotel
you
ca
of
course
get
into
your
own
house
here
let
me
carry
you
bub
picking
up
cyril
the
soil
real
sandy
here
and
makes
heavy
walking
if
as
i
presume
from
your
recommendation
of
it
it
is
your
best
house
of
entertainment
keith
said
in
reply
to
the
question
yes
sir
there
only
one
other
and
it
a
very
poor
affair
returned
ward
leading
the
way
mrs
prior
the
landlady
a
woman
with
kind
motherly
manners
met
them
at
the
door
with
a
welcome
nearly
as
hearty
as
that
of
their
old
time
friend
i
glad
to
see
you
she
said
bustling
about
to
wait
upon
them
we
plenty
o
room
here
in
town
for
the
right
sort
o
folks
and
glad
to
get
she
had
taken
them
into
her
parlor
the
only
one
the
house
afforded
the
furniture
was
plain
a
rag
carpet
green
paper
blinds
a
table
with
a
rod
and
black
cover
windsor
chairs
two
of
them
rocking
chairs
with
cushions
the
rest
and
hard
on
the
high
wooden
mantel
shelf
an
a
few
shells
and
two
brass
candlesticks
these
last
bright
as
scouring
could
make
them
i
afraid
it
must
seem
but
a
poor
place
to
you
ladies
she
continued
pushing
forward
a
rocking
chair
for
each
and
dreadful
tired
ai
you
with
your
long
journey
do
sit
down
and
rest
yourselves
you
are
very
kind
and
everything
looks
very
nice
indeed
keith
answered
looking
up
at
her
with
a
pleased
smile
as
she
accepted
the
offered
seat
and
began
untying
her
baby
bonnet
strings
indeed
i
for
one
did
expect
to
find
half
as
good
accommodations
out
in
these
western
wilds
remarked
aunt
wealthy
glancing
round
the
room
i
thought
you
had
no
floors
to
your
carpets
no
floors
oh
yes
rather
rough
to
be
sure
carpenters
here
do
make
the
best
of
work
and
i
think
sometimes
i
could
plane
a
board
better
myself
but
to
get
the
carpets
is
the
rub
we
mostly
make
ourselves
and
the
weavin
often
done
so
poor
that
they
do
last
no
time
hardly
soil
sandy
you
see
and
it
cuts
the
carpets
right
out
they
say
this
country
hard
on
women
and
oxen
put
in
ward
and
i
afraid
it
pretty
true
now
do
be
frightening
them
first
thing
ward
laughed
the
landlady
come
take
off
your
things
and
the
children
ladies
and
make
yourselves
to
home
here
just
let
me
lay
in
here
she
went
on
opening
an
inner
door
and
revealing
a
bed
covered
with
a
quilt
you
can
have
this
room
if
you
like
keith
i
you
prefer
a
downstairs
one
with
the
baby
and
little
ones
there
is
a
trundle
bed
underneath
that
do
for
them
and
the
rest
of
you
can
take
the
two
rooms
right
over
these
all
ready
and
you
can
go
right
up
to
whenever
you
like
is
there
anything
more
i
can
do
for
you
now
the
query
was
answered
in
the
negative
then
i
just
excuse
myself
she
said
for
i
must
go
and
see
to
the
supper
ca
trust
girls
here
she
passed
out
through
another
door
leaving
it
ajar
that
the
i
know
fan
i
see
two
big
tables
set
whispered
cyril
peeping
in
and
there
not
a
bit
of
carpet
on
the
floor
guess
they
cleanin
house
well
wife
i
have
to
leave
you
for
a
little
i
must
see

the
landing
of
our
goods
said
keith
taking
his
hat
will
you
go
along
ward
and
let
us
go
up
and
look
at
our
rooms
girls
said
mildred
to
her
sisters
may
we
mother
yes
go
and
make
yourselves
neat
for
the
supper
table
they
came
back
reporting
bare
floors
everywhere
of
boards
none
too
well
planed
either
but
everything
scrupulously
clean
then
we
may
well
be
content
said
their
mother
the
gentlemen
returned
and
the
guests
were
presently
summoned
by
the
ringing
of
a
bell
on
top
of
the
house
to
the
supper
table
which
they
found
furnished
with
abundance
of
good
wholesome
food
and
they
were
really
able
to
make
a
very
comfortable
meal
despite
the
presence
of
deli
ware
steel
forks
and
the
absence
of
napkins
what
about
the
goods
stuart
asked
keith
on
their
return
to
the
parlor
i
have
had
them
carted
directly
to
the
house
that
is
i
believe
the
men
are
at
it
now
the
house
the
one
ward
spoke
of
i
have
taken
it
it
was
hobson
choice

dear
or

have
seen
it
first

i
see
it
now
why
yes
if
you
choose
it
wo
be
dark
yet
for
an
hour
if
you
and
aunt
wealthy
will
put
on
your
bonnets
i
take
you
round
ada
and
me
too
father
cried
zillah
eagerly
and
fan
and
don
and
me
chorused
cyril
you
could
think
of
going
without
your
eldest
son
said
rupert
looking
about
for
his
hat
keith
turned
an
inquiring
eye
upon
her
husband
is
it
far
no
even
fan
can
easily
walk
it
let
them
come
you
too
mildred
taking
the
babe
from
her
arms
i
carry
baby
we
make
quite
a
procession
laughed
the
young
girl
wo
the
people
stare
what
if
they
do
who
of
us
cares
not
i
cried
rupert
stepping
back
from
the
doorway
with
a
commanding
wave
of
the
hand
procession
will
please
move
forward
keith
and
wife
taking
the
lead
miss
stanhope
and
miss
keith
next
in
order
zilly
and
ada
following
close
upon
their
heels
the
three
inseparables
after
them
while
marshal
rupert
brings
up
the
rear
to
see
that
all
are
in
line
everybody
laughed
at
this
sally
while
they
promptly
fell
into
line
as
directed
passed
out
upon
the
sidewalk
and
pursued
their
way
through
the
quiet
streets
people
did
stare
to
be
sure
from
open
doors
and
windows
some
asking
who
are
they
others
answering
new
comers
and
they
got
a
big
family
to
support
some
remarked
that
they
were
nice
looking
people
while
others
shook
their
heads
wisely
or
dubiously
and
said
they
expected
they
were
real
stuck
up
folks
dressed
so
dreadful
fine
however
the
subjects
of
these
charitable
comments
did
not
overhear
and
therefore
were
not
disturbed
by
them
do
you
see
that
yellow
frame
yonder
wife
keith
asked
as
they
turned
a
corner
with
the
to
the
street
and
two
doors
in
it
one
above
and
one
below
the
same
it
looks
like
a
warehouse
that
what
it
was
originally
intended
for
but
finding
it
not
available
for
that
purpose
the
owner
offered
it
for
rent
and
is
it
the
one
you
have
rented
yes
a
poor
place
to
take
you
to
my
dear
but
as
i
told
you
it
was
hobson
choice
then
we
make
the
best
of
it
and
be
thankful
what
a
horrid
old
thing
remarked
mildred
in
an
undertone
heard
only
by
aunt
wealthy
we
hope
to
find
the
inside
an
improvement
on
the
out
was
the
cheerful
rejoinder
it
has
need
to
be
i
should
say
cried
the
girl
as
they
drew
near
just
see
it
fronts
on
two
streets
and
there
not
a
bit
of
a
space
separating
it
from
either
doors
open
right
out
on
to
a
sand
bank
that
what
was
made
by
digging
the
cellar
said
rupert
there
a
big
yard
at
the
side
and
behind
said
zillah
something
green
in
it
too
added
ada
whose
sight
was
imperfect
nothing
but
a
crop
of
ugly
weeds
said
mildred
ready
to
cry
as
memory
brought
vividly
before
her
the
home
they
had
left
with
its
large
garden
carpeted
with
green
grass
adorned
with
shrubbery
and
filled
with
the
bloom
of
summer
flowers
the
june
roses
must
be
out
now
and
the
woodbine
the
air
sweet
with
their
delicious
perfume
and
they
who
had
planted
and
tended
them
so
far
away
in
this
desolate
looking
spot
not
a
tree
a
shrub
a
flower
or
a
blade
of
grass
she
went
on
sighing
as
she
spoke
never
mind
we
have
lots
of
them
next
year
if
i
plant
every
one
myself
said
rupert
the
last
load
of
their
household
goods
had
just
been
brought
up
from
the
river
the
men
were
carrying
in
the
heavy
boxes
and
setting
them
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
front
room
the
door
stood
wide
open
and
they
all
walked
in
not
a
bit
of
a
hall
exclaimed
mildred
not
a
cupboard
or
closet
nothing
but
four
bare
walls
and
two
windows
each
side
of
the
front
door
yes
the
floor
and
ceilings
corrected
rupert
and
another
door
on
the
other
side
said
ada
running
and
opening
it
not
a
mantelpiece
to
set
anything
on
nor
any
chimney
at
all
how
on
earth
are
we
going
to
keep
warm
in
the
winter
time
mildred
went
on
ignoring
the
remarks
of
her
younger
brother
and
sister
with
a
stove
miss
pipes
run
up
through
the
floor
into
the
room
above
there
a
flue
there
said
one
of
the
men
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
the
sleeve
of
his
checked
shirt
keith
stopped
to
settle
with
the
men
for
their
work
and
the
others
walked
on
into
the
next
room
it
was
as
bare
and
more
dreary
than
the
first
somewhat
larger
but
had
only
one
window
that
and
an
outside
door
opening
directly
upon
the
side
street
back
of
the
two
rooms
and
in
a
line
with
them
was
the
kitchen
smaller
than
either
of
the
other
rooms
but
provided
with
a
chimney
and
fireplace
also
a
small
dark
closet
under
a
flight
of
steep
and
crooked
stairs
which
led
from
it
to
the
story
above
this
as
they
found
on
climbing
up
to
it
consisted
of
two
rooms
the
first
extending
over
kitchen
and
the
other
over
the
front
room
and
of
exactly
the
same
size
the
stairs
led
directly
into
the
first
room
and
it
must
be
passed
through
to
reach
the
second
therefore
had
not
the
recommendation
of
privacy
what
a
house
grumbled
the
children
how
we
ever
live
in
it
such
a
few
rooms
and
not
a
bit
nice
keith
stood
in
the
middle
of
that
large
upper
room
saying
never
a
word
but
her
heart
sinking
lower
and
lower
as
she
glanced
from
side
to
side
taking
in
the
whole
situation
aunt
wealthy
saw
it
and
came
to
the
rescue
never
mind
dearie
it
will
look
very
different
when
we
have
unpacked
and
arranged
your
furniture
with
the
help
of
curtains
several
rooms
can
be
made
out
of
this
and
we
do
nicely
yes
no
doubt
we
shall
auntie
keith
answered
with
determined
cheerfulness
that
front
room
shall
be
yours
no
no
you
and
stuart
must
take
that
i
quite
set
on
having
my
own
way
in
this
interrupted
the
younger
lady
in
her
turn
it
is
the
best
room
and
you
must
take
it
hesitate
or
object
for
i
should
be
afraid
to
have
my
little
ones
in
there
with
that
outside
door
opening
on
to
nothing
she
concluded
with
a
laugh
well
wife
what
do
you
think
asked
keith
coming
up
the
stairs
that
we
can
be
very
happy
here
if
we
make
up
our
minds
to
be
content
with
our
lot
that
is
like
you
marcia
always
ready
to
make
the
best
of
everything
he
said
with
a
pleased
look
i
think
it
a
dreadful
place
exclaimed
mildred
like
a
great
barn
and
so
dirty
plaster
all
over
the
floor
and
spattered
on
the
windows
too
i
hope
it
can
be
cleaned
her
father
said
laughing
at
her
rueful
face
mrs
prior
can
probably
tell
us
where
to
find
a
woman
to
do
it
a
little
more
time
was
spent
in
discussing
plans
for
the
arrangement
of
the
inside
of
the
dwelling
then
they
stepped
into
the
and
viewed
it
from
the
out
a
great
dead
wall
of
rough
weather
boarding
broken
by
one
window
only
and
that
in
the
second
story
was
what
met
their
view
as
they
looked
up
down
below
first
a
heap
of
sand
beyond
that
a
wilderness
of
weeds
and
brushwood
i
dumb
with
despair
cried
mildred
folding
her
hands
with
a
tragical
air
can
dumb
folks
talk
asked
cyril
as
ugly
as
mud
this
side
remarked
zillah
turning
up
her
nose
scornfully
as
she
scanned
the
unsightly
wall
we
cover
it
with
vines
said
aunt
wealthy
and
i
clear
the

it
up
by
the
roots

he
spoke

be
nearly
so
hard
as
the
clearing
the
early
pioneers
of
ohio
had
to
do
our
grandfathers
among
the
rest
that
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
my
boy
responded
keith
heartily
come
now
we
lock
up
the
house
and
go
back
to
our
hotel
for
the
night
there
a
log
house
nearly
opposite
remarked
rupert
when
they
were
in
the
street
again
and
the
next
is
a
real
shabby
frame
with
a
blacksmith
shop
attached
we
have
the
worst
place
in
town
after
all
ho
look
at
the
sign

what
a
name
for
a
blacksmith
mrs
prior
joined
her
guests
in
the
parlor
after
the
younger
portion
had
gone
to
bed
well
how
did
you
like
the
house
she
asked
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
make
ourselves
comfortable
there
keith
answered
in
a
cheerful
tone
you
can
get
possession
right
away
i
yes
and
want
to
move
in
as
quickly
as
possible
but
must
have
some
cleaning
done
first
mrs
prior
recommended
a
woman
for
that
without
waiting
to
be
asked
and
offered
to
send
round
at
once
and
see
if
she
could
be
engaged
for
the
next
day
the
offer
was
accepted
with
thanks
and
the
messenger
brought
back
word
that
rood
would
be
at
the
house
by
six
in
the
morning
but
suggested
aunt
wealthy
in
dismay
she
want
hot
water
soap
cloths
scrubbing
brushes
i
lend
a
big
iron
kettle
to
heat
the
water
said
the
landlady
a
fire
can
be
made
in
that
kitchen
fireplace
you
know
or
out
doors
with
the
brush
wood
and
brushes
and
soap
can
be
had
at
the
stores
i
presume
suggested
keith
yes
and
if
they
ai
open
in
time
i
lend
mine
for
her
to
start
on
thank
you
very
much
said
keith
but
stuart
we
may
as
well
unpack
our
own
i
can
tell
you
just
which
box
to
open
what
a
woman
you
are
for
doing
things
systematically
marcia
he
said
admiringly
yours
is
the
best
plan
i
think
can
we
be
up
in
season
to
be
on
hand
there
at
five
think
you
we
can
try
she
answered
brightly
mrs
prior
where
is
your
market
we
have
got
to
that
yet
replied
the
landlady
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
no
market
why
how
do
you
manage
without
there
butcher
shops
where
we
can
buy
fresh
meat
once
or
twice
a
week
beef
veal
mutton
lamb
just
whatever
they
happen
to
kill
and
we
put
up
our
own
salt
pork
hams
dried
beef
and
so
forth
and
keep
codfish
and
mackerel
on
hand
most
folks
have
their
own
chickens
and
the
country
people
bring
in
too
and
butter
and
eggs
and
vegetables
though
a
good
many
town
folks
have
garden
sass
of
their
own
raisin
keep
a
cow
and
make
their
own
butter
that
the
most
independent
way
remarked
keith
i
think
i
must
have
a
cow
if
i
can
get
a
girl
who
can
milk
do
you
know
of
a
good
girl
wanting
a
place
mrs
prior
i
wish
i
did
but
they
dreadful
scarce
sir
and
so
sassy
you
keep
unless
you
let
come
to
the
table
with
the

you
must
be
mighty
careful

you

been
in

with
perhaps
an
added
touch
of
intelligence
and
a
somewhat
more
bold
and
forward
manner
there
were
besides
several
younger

i

they
were
neighborly
folk
those
early
settlers
of
pleasant
plains
always
ready
to
lend
a
helping

wherever
it
was
needed
it
the
new
lawyer
feller
traps
announced
lightcap
as
he
and
his
son
rejoined
the
waiting
expectant
wife
and
children
he
took
the
house
and
we
have
for
neighbors
there
was
another
rush
to
the
door
half
an
hour
later
when
the
keiths
were
seen
passing
on
their
way
to
inspect
their
future
abode
the
prettiest
gal
i
ever
see
remarked

gazing
admiringly
after

they
look

rhoda
jane
look
at
the
white
pantalets
on
them
young
uns
and
the
girl
got
a
veil
on
her
bunnit
well
what
the
harm
asked
her
brother
if
you
had
as
pretty
a
skin
i
guess
you
be
for
takin
care
of
it
too
humph
beauty
that
only
skin
deep
wo
last
and
with
a
toss
of
the
head
miss
lightcap
walked
into
the
house
in
her
most
dignified
style
for
the
next
ten
days
the
doings
at
the
corner
house
and
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
keiths
were
a
source
of
entertainment
and
intense
interest
to
their
neighbors
the
lightcaps
and
others
a
fact
not
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
consider
the
monotony
of
life
in
the
town
at
that
time
no
railroad
no
telegraph
no
newspaper
except
those
brought
by
the
weekly
mail
no
magazines
no
public
library
and
very
few
books
in
private
houses
really
the
daily
small
occurrences
in
their
own
little
world
were
pretty
nearly
all
the
pleasant
plainers
could
find
to
talk
or
think
about
and
the
keiths
as
recent
arrivals
from
an
older
settled
part
of
the
country
and
above
many
of
them
in
the
social
scale
were
considered
worthy
of
more
than
ordinary
attention
their
dress
their
manners
the
furnishing
of
their
house
and
their
style
of
living
were
subjects
of
eager
discussion
the
general
opinion
among
the
lightcaps
and
their
set
seemed
to
be
that
they
were
too
fine
for
the
place
such
remarks
as
the
following
being
frequently
heard
why
would
you
believe
it
they
got
a
real
store
carpet
on
that
front
room
and
a
sofy
and
cheers
covered
with
cloth
and
white
curtains
to
the
winders
and
picturs
hanging
up
on
to
the
walls
and
the
little
girls
wears
white
pantalets
caliker
ones
such
as
our
youngsters
wears
is
good
enough
for
them
there
were
in
the
town
however
a
number
of
families
of
educated
refined
people
who
rejoiced
in
this
addition
to
their
society
and
only
waited
for
the
new
comers
to
get
settled
in
their
new
home
before
calling
among
these
keith
and
her
aunt
found
several
pleasant
congenial
companions
and
with
two
or
three
the
acquaintance
soon
ripened
into
a
close
intimacy
a
warm
enduring
friendship
mildred
also
soon
had
more
than
one
young
girl
crony
whom
she
found
as
worthy
of
regard
as
those
she
had
left
behind
back
of
the
yellow
house
was
a
grove
of
saplings
which
became
a
favorite
haunt
of
the
children
in
their
hours
of
recreation
they
would
bend
down
the
smaller
trees
and
ride
them
climb
up
into
the
larger
and
sit
among
the
branches
or
build
and
play
housekeeping
underneath
where
the
shade
was
thickest
it
was
here
they
spent
the
warm
sunny
days
while
the
older
members
of
the
family
busied
themselves
in
making
the
dwelling
habitable
and
the
yard
neat
and
orderly
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
rupert
spread
a
buffalo
robe
on
the
ground
in
the
shadiest
part
of
the
grove
whereon
zillah
and
ada
seated
themselves
with
their
baby
sister
who
had
been
entrusted
to
their
care
there
were
many
lovely
wild
flowers
springing
up
here
and
there
and
cyril
don
and
fan
ran
hither
and
thither
gathering
them
prattling
merrily
to
each
other
the
while
and
now
and
then
uttering
a
joyous
shout
as
they
came
upon
some
new
floral
treasure
be
careful
not
to
go
too
far
away
children
zillah
called
to
them
no
we
wo
go
far
they
answered
cyril
adding
and
i
take
care
of
fan
in
a
little
while
they
came
running
back
with
full
hands
see
see
they
said
so
many
and
such
pretty
ones
blue
and
white
and
purple
and
yellow
there

these
and
we
pick
some
more
for
ourselves
and
for
mother
and
aunt
wealthy
we
make
a
big
bunch
for
each
of
them
and
away
they
ran
again
oh

they
pretty
cried
ada
let
make
a
bouquet
for
mother
out
of
these
she
wo

said
zillah
just
now
when
she
no
place
to
put
them
let
make
wreaths
for
annis
and
fan
oh
yes
and
they
began
sorting
the
flowers
with
eager
interest
little
annis
pulling
at
them
too
crowing
and
chattering
in
sweet
baby
fashion
suddenly
zillah
gave
a
start
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
ada
arm
her
face
had
grown
very
pale
and
there
was
a
look
of
terror
in
her
large
blue
eyes
ada
turned
quickly
to
see
what
had
caused
it
and
was
quite
as
much
alarmed
on
beholding
a
tall
indian
with
rifle
in
hand
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
in
his
belt
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
them
evidently
regarding
them
with
curiosity
he
wore
moccasins
and
leggins
and
had
a
blanket
about
his
shoulders
feathers
on
his
head
too
but
no
war
paint
on
his
face
behind
him
was
a
squaw
with
a
great
bark
basket
full
of
wild
berries
slung
to
her
back
the
little
girls
were
too
terribly
frightened
to
cry
out
or
speak
they
sat
there
as
if
turned
to
stone
while
the
indian
drew
nearer
and
nearer
still
closely
followed
by
his
squaw
stopping
close
beside
the
children
he
grunted
out
a
word
or
two
to
her
and
she
slung
her
basket
to
the
ground
taking
up
a
double
handful
of
the
berries
he
poured
them
into
lap
saying
pappoose
the
squaw
restored
her
basket
to
its
place
and
the
two
walked
leisurely
away
happily
not
in
the
direction
of
fan
and
the
boys
the
little
girls
gazed
at
each
other
in
blank
astonishment
then
burst
out
simultaneously
oh
were
you
frightened
i
thought
he
was
going
to
kill
us
but
was
it
good
in
him
to
give
us
the
berries
yes
he
meant
them
for
baby
but
mother
does
let
her
have
any
you
know
so
we
must
give
them
to
her
no
but
i
call
the
children
to
get
some
yes
do
where
did
you
get
em
queried
cyril
devouring
his
share
with
zest
an
indian
gave
them
to
us
an
indian
why
that
was
like
a
friend
and
colation
i
sha
be
of
any
more
i
do
know
returned
ada
with
a
wise
shake
of
her
head
i
rather
not
see
even
with
their
berries
the
little
feast
was
just
ended
when
they
espied
a
gentleman
passing
along
the
road
beyond
the
grove
he
turned
and
came
toward
them
he
said
pleasantly
these
are
keith
children
i
believe
yes
sir
answered
zillah
i
glad
to
see
you
shaking
hands
with
them
and
i
should
like
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
parents
are
they
at
home
in
the
house
yonder
mother
is
sir
but
i
saw
father
go
away
a
little
while
ago
do
you
think
your
mother
could
see
me
for
a
moment
my
name
is
lord
cyril
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
gazing
up
into
the
gentleman
face
with
an
odd
expression
of
mingled
curiosity
and
astonishment
i
do
know
sir
answered
zillah
they
just
cleaning
the
house
and
cyril
run
and
ask
mother
away
flew
the
child
rushing
into
the
room
where
miss
stanhope
and
keith
were
overseeing
the
opening
of
boxes
and
the
unpacking
of
the
household
gear
mother
mother
he
cried
breathlessly
the
lord
out
yonder
and
he
wants
to
see
you
can
he
come
in
shall
i
bring
him
the
lord
what
can
the
child
mean
cried
aunt
wealthy
in
her
astonishment
and
perplexity
nearly
dropping
a
large
china
bowl
which
she
held
in
her
hand
keith
too
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
then
a
sudden
light
breaking
over
her
face
yes
bring
him
in
she
said
and
turning
to
her
aunt
as
the
child
sped
on
his
errand
it
must
be
the
minister
auntie
i
remember
now
that
stuart
told
me
his
name
was
lord
lord
who
was
a
very
man
came
in
apologizing
for
his
neglect
in
not
calling
sooner
he
had
been
engaged
with
his
sermon
and
the
matter
had
slipped
his
mind
i
think
you
are
blaming
yourself
undeservedly
sir
keith
said
giving
him
her
hand
with
a
cordial
smile
we
arrived
in
town
only
yesterday
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
aunt
miss
stanhope
the
two
shook
hands
and
lord
seating
himself
upon
a
box
instead
of
the
chair
that
had
been
set
for
him
sprang
up
instantly
with
a
hurried
exclamation
a
portion
of
the
contents
of
a
paper
of
tacks
had
been
accidentally
spilt
there
the
ladies
were
too
polite
to
smile
keith
offered
the
chair
again
simply
saying
you
will
find
this
a
more
comfortable
seat
please
excuse
the
disorder
we

bit
of
gingerbread
in
the
little
one

piped
the
small
voices
of
don
and
fan
but
father
always
asks
a
blessing
first
yes
assented
zillah
stopping
short
in
her
distribution
of
the
good
things
and
mother
does
it
when
he
away
but
and
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
childish
but
grave
faces
of
the
little
group
i
do
it
said
cyril
closing
his
merry
blue
eyes
and
folding
his
chubby
hands

spread
our
handkerchiefs
in

laps
to

greasy
crumbs
from
our
clothes
oh

fordot

ada
and
fan
and
yourself
then

last
we
the
gentlemen
no
myself
last
because
that
the
way
mother
does
and
mother
and
father
always
do
everything
right
commented
ada
beginning
upon
her
sandwich
they
were
rosy
healthy
children
and
their
appetites
were
keen
but
they
were
not
selfish
or
greedy
and
the
supply
of
food
was
more
than
amply
sufficient
for
all
they
were
never
stinted
but
had
been
taught
that
waste
was
sinful
so
the
remains
of
the
meal
were
put
carefully
by
in
the
basket
which
zillah
then
hung
up
on
a
branch
near
at
hand
as
she
did
so
the
others
set
up
a
glad
shout
mother
coming
and
sprang
forward
to
meet
her
while
baby
held
out
her
hands
with
a
crow
of
delight
well
dears
had
you
plenty
of
dinner
keith
asked
taking
annis
in
her
arms
and
sitting
down
on
the
buffalo
robe
while
they
grouped
themselves
about
her
oh
yes
yes
indeed
some
left
and
it
was
very
good
thank
you
for
it
mother
you
quite
deserved
it
you
have
been
dear
good
children
taking
care
of
yourselves
and
baby
all
morning
and
not
giving
any
trouble
to
anybody
how
the
young
cheeks
flushed
and
the
eyes
grew
bright
at
these
words
of
commendation
from
those
dear
lips
how
they
loved
her
for
them
and
what
an
increased
desire
to
merit
her
approbation
they
felt
swelling
in
their
breasts
she
could
stay
with
them
only
a
little
while
but
suggested
various
amusements
some
games
they
might
play
some
stories
zillah
might
relate
to
the
younger
ones
are
you
getting
done
fast
mother
can
we
sleep
in
our
own
home
they
asked
no
dears
for
though
the
bedroom
floors
are
cleaned
there
might
be
some
dampness
that
would
injure
us
we
will
go
back
to
the
tavern
for
our
supper
and
to
sleep
but
night
we
will
be
in
our
own
home
once
more
not
the
nice
home
we
used
to
have
though
sighed
zillah
no
daughter
but
we
must
try
to
be
content
and
thankful
and
if
we
are
we
may
be
as
happy
in
the
new
home
as
we
were
in
the
old
with
that
the
now
sleeping
babe
was
laid
gently
down
on
the
robe
a
light
covering
thrown
over
her
and
with
a
charge
to
the
others
to
take
care
of
her
and
a
caress
bestowed
upon
each
the
mother

undertone

the
subjects
of
her
remarks
were
two
little
maids
one
about
her
own
size
the
other
a
trifle
smaller
who
were
slowly
making
their
way
through
the
bushes
toward
the
spot
where
the
keith
children
were
seated
they
had
sallow
sunburnt
faces
tawny
yellow
locks
straggling
over
their
shoulders
and
their
thin
lanky
little
forms
were
arrayed
in
calico
dresses
faded
worn
and
skimpy
pantalets
of
the
same
material
but
different
color
appeared
below
their
skirts
their
feet
were
bare
and
on
their
heads
were
sunbonnets
of
pasteboard
covered
with
still
another
pattern
of
calico
both
faded
and
soiled
shall
we
ask
them
to
come
and
join
us
queried
zillah

whispered
cyril
with
a
glance
of
disgust
directed
toward
the
strangers

fing
out

basket
good
afternoon
little
girls
said
zillah
raising
her
voice
slightly
as
they
drew
near
will
you
come
and
sit
with
us
they
shook
their
heads
but
came
creeping
on
each
with
a
finger
in
her
mouth
have
you
had
your
dinner
an
affirmative
nod
i
going
to
tell
a
story

sister

is
now

on
and
tell
your
story
min
let
set
down
on
the
grass
right
here
they
listened
in
wonder
till
summoned
by
a
shrill
voice
from
the
direction
of
the
smithy
when
they
rose
and
scampered
away
the
keiths
were
a
very
domestic
family
no
place
like
home
to
them
and
all
from
the
father
down
to
little
fan
were
heartily
weary
of
the
unsettled
life
they
had
led
for
some
weeks
past
it
was
therefore
with
joy
they
found
themselves
once
more
able
to
sit
down
under
their
own
vine
and
fig
tree
if
a
rented
domicile
so
unsightly
as
the
yellow
house
on
the
corner
may
fitly
be
compared
to
natural
objects
so
full
of
beauty
and
grace
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
the
advanced
stage
of
the
internal
improvements
warranted
them
in
taking
possession
as
the
shadows
grew
long
the
children
were
called
in
the
family
gathered
about
a
neatly
appointed
table
set
out
in
the
centre
one
of
the
three
lower
rooms
spoken
of
indifferently
as
the
sitting
or
since
it
must
answer
both
purposes
the
meal
was
enlivened
by
cheerful
chat
in
which
the
children
were
allowed
to
take
part
the
only
restriction
being
that
but
one
voice
was
to
be
heard
at
a
time
and
that
not
in
loud
or
boisterous
tones
no
domestic
had
been
found
yet
and
leaving
mother
and
aunt
to
chat
with
the
father
mildred
and
the
younger
girls
cleared
the
table
washed
the
dishes
and
made
all
neat
in
the
kitchen
this
done
they
returned
to
the
the
great
family
bible
lay
open
on
the
table
before
the
father
a
pile
of
beside
it
these
last
rupert
took
up
and
distributed
the
father
read
a
few
verses
of
scripture
and
gave
out
a
hymn
the
mother
sweet
voice
set
the
tune
the
others
joined
in
and
a
full
chorus
of
praise
swelled
upon
the
summer
evening
air
it
died
away
and
all
knelt
while
the
father
offered
a
short
but
fervent
prayer
giving
thanks
for
the
mercies
of
the
day
asking
for
protection
through
the
night
confessing
sins
and
pleading
for
pardon
and
eternal
life
for
all
temporal
and
spiritual
good
through
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
it
was
thus
each
day
was
begun
and
ended
in
this
truly
christian
family
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
was
the
resolution
with
which
and
keith
had
begun
their
married
life
each
little
one
came
to
claim
a
kiss
from
father
and
aunt
wealthy
then
cheerfully
followed
their
mother
up
the
steep
crooked
stairway
to
the
large
room
above
oh
how
much
nicer
it
looks
they
cried
auntie
room
too
running
to
the
open
door
and
peeping
in
everything
was
now
clean
and
neat
carpets
covered
the
rough
boards
of
the
floor
curtains
draped
the
windows
and
divided
the
large
room
into
several
apartments
in
each
of
which
was
a
neat
white
bed
but
little
of
their
heavy
furniture
had
been
brought
with
them
from
the
old
home
but
its
place
was
partially
supplied
by
turning
packing
boxes
into
and
cushioned
lounges
and
toilet
tables
whose
unsightliness
was
concealed
by
dainty
drapery
ingenuity
and
taste
had
done
wonders
in
making
the
house
comfortable
and
attractive
at
small
expense

at

she
may
do
well
enough
for

with
a
lighted
candle
and
a
pair
of
snuffers
which
she
placed
on
the
table
miss
stanhope

asking

mrs

ignorant
yet
mostly
well
meaning
with

all
real
honest
and
industrious
there

housework
on

down
viny

to
set

table
for
dinner
shown
where
to
find
the
requisite
articles
told
how
many
were
in
the
family
and
left
to
the
performance
of
her
task
mildred
noted
the
number
of
plates
set
on
and
saw
that
viny
had
counted
herself
in
with
the
rest
you

one
plate
too

she
said
with
some
sharpness
of
tone

and
if

cook
the
victuals

a
right
to

a
warning
glance
from
her
mother
eye
checked
the
angry
exclamation
on
the
tip
of
mildred
tongue
we
will
consent
to
your
coming
to
the
table
with
us
viny
on

keith
remarked
in
a
quiet
tone
and
now
you
may
help
me
to
dish
up
the
dinner
aunt
wealthy
was
busied
with
her
candle
moulds
in
one
corner
of
the
kitchen
putting
in
the
wicks
so
that
question
settled
she
said
in
an
aside
to
her
niece
and
i
think
you
have
done
wisely
marcia
the
faces
that
surrounded
the
that
day
were
a
study
those
of
miss
stanhope
and
keith
wore
their
usual
placid
expression
but
mildred
was
flushed
and
angry
rupert
full
of
astonishment
reflected
to
some
extent
by
the
younger
ones
while
that
of
the
new
comer
expressed
and
defiance
keith
glanced
quizzically
from
one
to
another
for
a
moment
then
gave
his
attention
to
filling
the
plates
talking
at
the
same
time
in
a
cheerful
strain
i
have
found
a
lot
wife
which
i
think
will
suit
us
for
building
on
if
nobody
feels
too
tired
for
a
walk
after
tea
we
will
all
go
and
look
at
it
it
is
to
be
for
the
family
and
the
family
must
decide
as
to
its
merits
this
turned
the
current
of
thought
and
all
the
young
people
grew
eager
and
animated
it
was
quite
evident
that
no
one
intended
to
be
too
much
fatigued
to
be
of
the
party
of
inspection
in
the
midst
of
the
talk
a
low
exclamation
from
fan
drew
the
attention
of
all
and
following
the
direction
of
her
glance
they
saw
a
tall
indian
in
the
doorway
while
beyond
in
the
street
were
many
others
some
on
foot
some
on
horseback
some
in
the
act
of
dismounting
they
were
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
the
papooses
tied
into
little
wooden
troughs
which
the
mothers
stood
up
on
end
on
the
ground
the
babies
were
very
quiet
not
a
whimper
to
be
heard
from
any
of
them
though
they
were
deprived
of
the
use
of
their
hands
their
clothing
being
a
straight
strip
of
cloth
folded
around
their
bodies
in
such
a
way
as
to
pin
their
poor
little
arms
down
to
their
sides
and
had
nothing
to
amuse
them
but
a
string
of
tiny
bells
stretched
across
the
trough
in
front
of
their
faces
ugh
said
the
indian
on
the
doorstep
shawp
and
he
pointed
from
a
basket
of
berries
his
squaw
had
set
down
beside
him
to
the
loaf
on
the
table
oh
do
let
give
it
to
no
knowin
what
do
if
we
do
cried
viny
in
a
fright
it
will
be
a
good
enough
exchange
said
keith
taking
the
loaf
and
handing
it
to
the
indian
bring
a
pan
for
the
berries
the
indian
passed
the
loaf
on
to
his
squaw
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
poured
a
quart
or
so
of
berries
into
the
pan
viny
had
hastened
to
bring
then
again
pointed
to
the
table
what
now
asked
keith
the
indian
replied
by
a
gesture
as
if
lifting
a
cup
to
his
lips
and
mildred
saying
he
thirsty
hastened
to
pour
out
a
tumbler
of
milk
and
hand
it
to
him
he
drank
it
returned
the
glass
with
a
nod
of
thanks
and
walked
away
i
just
run
hout
and
water
hall
said
viny
hurrying
into
the
kitchen
for
a
bucket
and
tin
cup
it
always
best
to
keep
on
the
good
side
of
folks
tell
me
if
you
do
want
to
run
no
risk
of
the
hoff
yer
keith
was
standing
in
the
doorway
where
the
indian
had
been
a
moment
before
come
and
look
at
them
wife
and
all
of
you
he
said
it
quite
a
show
and
there
not
the
least
danger
thus
encouraged
the
children
crowded
to
the
door
and
window
and
found
much
amusement
in
watching
the
movements
of
the
savages
and
efforts
to
win
favor
with
them
efforts
apparently
for
the
day
was
warm
and
they
drank
the
cool
water
freshly
drawn
from
the
well
in
the
yard
as
if
they
found
it
very
refreshing
the
troop
some
thirty
or
forty
in
number
did
not
tarry
long
in
less
than
an
hour
they
had
all
remounted
and
gone
on
their
way
there
them
savage
wild
hinguns
is
all
clear
gone
and
hour
scalps
is
safe
for
the
present
remarked
viny
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
the
last
one
disappeared
from
view
in
a
cloud
of
dust
far
down
the
street
she
had
run
out
to
the
corner
of
the
house
dishtowel
in
hand
to
watch
their
movements
as
far
as
she
could
see
them
do
talk
so
you
frighten
the
children
said
mildred
reprovingly
speaking
from
the
front
door
where
she
stood
with
the
little
ones
grouped
about
her
i
do
take
my
horders
from
you
muttered
the
girl
stalking
back
to
her
kitchen
after
an
early
tea
the
proposed
family
walk
was
taken
the
lot
a
little
farther
to
the
north
than
any
which
had
been
built
upon
as
yet
on
the
high
river
bank
and
overlooking
the
ferry
was
pronounced
all
that
could
be
desired
it
was
on
a
corner
and
on
two
sides
afforded
a
fine
view
of
the
river
on
the
others
of
town
and
country
when
we
have
our
house
built
remarked
keith
we
be
able
to
see
the
kankakee
marsh
from
the
second
story
windows
marsh
repeated
his
wife
in
a
tone
of
alarm
how
far
off
is
it
we
about
two
miles
from
this
end
it
is
two
hundred
miles
long
you
remember
extending
far
over
into
illinois
but
why
that
sigh
ague
well
do
let
us
cross
the
bridge
before
we
come
to
it
this
is
a
beautiful
spot
i
think
we
can
in
a
few
years
make
it
superior
in
point
of
beauty
to
any
we
have
ever
lived
in
i
think
so
too
if
we
can
keep
these
fine
old
oaks
there
were
several
of
them
grand
old
trees
that
had
stood
the
storms
of
centuries
perhaps
we
will
we
manage
our
building
in
a
way
not
to
interfere
with
them
at
that
mildred
face
brightened
as
it
had
not
since
her
first
sight
of
the
yellow
house
she
had
been
very
homesick
for
the
dear
old
home
in
lansdale
though
not
a
word
of
it
had
she
breathed
even
into
her
mother
sympathetic
ear
how
soon
can
the
house
be
done
she
asked
better
inquire
first
how
soon
it
will
be
begun
laughed
her
father
if
we
get
into
it
by
next
spring
we
may
consider
ourselves
fortunate
oh
dear
sighed
the
children
with
one
accord
the
time
will
slip
around
before
you
know
it
dears
remarked
their
aunt
cheerily
and
we
soon
get
the
ground
fenced
in
and
let
you
spend
your
leisure
time
and
exercise
your
taste
and
ingenuity
in
beautifying
it
said
their
father
and
may
we
all
help
plan
the
house
asked
rupert
keith
smiled
a
kindly
smile
with
some
amusement
in
it
too
you
may
all
make
suggestions
it
is
to
be
our
house
not
the
only
but
the
children
too

gotobed
standing
just
outside

he
turned
his
head
the
other
way
shamefacedly
as
mildred
looking
sweet
and
fair
in
white
muslin
and
pink
ribbons
followed
her
younger
sisters
into
the
street
and
sent
a
casual
glance
in
his
direction

rhoda

it
be
meetin
time
we
know
it
a
narrow
bordered
on
each
side
by
grass
still
wet
with
dew
led
past
the
grove
of
saplings
to
the
little
church
whither
the
keiths
were
bound
mildred
lifting
her
white
skirts
daintily
and
warning
her
sisters
and
brothers
of
the
danger
of
wet
and
soiled
shoes
should
they
step
aside
from
the
beaten
track
picked
her
way
with
careful
steps
rejoicing
in
the
fact
that
the
distance
was
not
great
the
church
membership
was
as
yet
very
small
sabbath
school
ditto
the
newly
arrived
family
made
an
important
addition
to
the
ranks
of
both
teachers
and
scholars
two
bible
classes
were
organized
this
morning
and
given
respectively
into
the
charge
of
keith
and
miss
stanhope
rupert
becoming
a
member
of
his
father
mildred
of
aunt
wealthy
there
were
but
two
others
in
this
latter
class
claudina
chetwood
and
lucilla
grange
both
intelligent
refined
girls
who
made
an
agreeable
impression
upon
miss
stanhope
and
mildred
also
and
this
was
mutual
the
morning
service
followed
immediately
upon
the
close
of
sabbath
school
the
sermon
was
excellent
the
singing
though
not
artistic
and
somewhat
interrupted
by
the
necessity
of
lining
out
the
hymn
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
books
earnest
and
spirited
the
people
singing
apparently
with
the
understanding
and
the
heart
also
the
prayer
was
fervent
and
the
behavior
of
the
congregation
throughout
the
whole
service
was
quiet
and
devotional
most
of
them
were
town
folk
but
a
few
families
had
come
in
from
the
surrounding
country
there
was
little
display
of
fashion
or
style
in
dress
no
one
was
expensively
attired
most
of
the
women
and
girls
wore
calico
but
all
were
neat
some
really
tasteful
and
in
intellect
and
moral
worth
the
majority
of
faces
would
have
compared
favorably
with
an
equal
number
in
the
older
states
people
lingered
after
church
for
mutual
introductions
and
the
exchange
of
friendly
remarks
and
inquiries
the
keiths
were
warmly
welcomed
assured
of
intentions
to
call
hopes
expressed
that
they
would
like
the
place
feel
quite
at
home
in
the
church
and
be
sociable
the
country
people
adding
come
out
and
see
us
whenever
you
can
squire
chetwood
and
keith
who
had
made
acquaintance
during
the
preceding
week
now
introduced
their
families
each
with
very
excusable
fatherly
pride
in
the
good
looks
and
good
manners
of
his
offspring
the
young
chetwoods
were
nearly
as
numerous
as
handsome
and
intelligent
as
the
keiths
i
hope
we
shall
be
good
friends
said
claudina
as
she
and
mildred
walked
away
together
mother
was
not
out
because
of
a
headache
but
she
and
i
are
coming
to
see
your
mother
and
you
this
week
we
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
mildred
answered
heartily
and
i
am
very
glad
to
accept
your
offer
of
friendship
they
parted
at
keith
door
mutually
pleased
and
mildred
carried
a
brighter
face
into
the
house
than
she
had
worn
for
weeks
her
mother
remarked
upon
it
with
delight
yes
mother
she
responded
gayly
i
begin
to
feel
a
little
happier
about
living
here
now
that
i
find
we
are
to
have
good
preaching
sunday
school
with
an
excellent
and
competent
teacher
for
my
share
glancing
archly
at
aunt
wealthy
kindly
sensible
face
and
pleasant
friends
going
on
to
give
a
flattering
description
of
the
chetwoods
particularly
claudina
i
hope
she
will
prove
a
valuable
friend
and
a
very
great
comfort
to
you
daughter
said
keith
you
need
young
companionship
and
i
am
very
glad
to
know
that
it
will
be
provided
the
little
girls
had
been
up
stairs
putting
away
their
best
bonnets
where
viny
asked
zillah
running
back
into
the
where
the
older
people
still
were
she
went
out
telling
me
that
she
would
be
back
till
bedtime
replied
the
mother
leaving
us
to
do
our
own
work
cried
mildred
oh
mother
what
made
you
let
her
let
her
my
child
she
did
not
ask
my
permission
laughed
keith
but
indeed
i
think
we
are
quite
as
well
off
without
her
for
as
we
do
no
cooking
on
sunday
before
another
week
had
passed
mildred
was
ready
to
subscribe
to
the
opinion
that
they
were
as
well
without
her
altogether
she
having
proved
herself
utterly
inefficient
slow
and
slovenly
about
her
work
unwilling
to
be
directed
impertinent
bold
and
forward
there
was
not
a
day
when
mildred
indignation
did
not
rise
to
fever
heat
in
view
of
the
many
and
aggravated
sins
of
omission
and
commission
on
the
part
of
their
help
yet
it
seldom
found
vent
in
words
she
was
striving
with
determined
purpose
to
rule
her
own
spirit
and
asking
daily
and
hourly
for
strength
for
the
conflict
from
him
who
has
said
in
me
is
thine
help
my
strength
is
made
perfect
in
weakness
the
example
set
her
by
her
mother
and
aunt
was
also
most
helpful
they
were
both
cheerful
patient
women
never
a
word
of
fretfulness
or
complaint
from
the
lips
of
either
aunt
wealthy
calm
and
serene
as
an
unclouded
summer
day
keith
often
bringing
to
her
aid
a
strong
sense
of
the
ludicrous
turning
her
vexations
into
occasions
for
jesting
and
mirth
mildred
knew
that
they
were
trials
nevertheless
and
her
love
and
admiration
and
her
resolve
to
show
herself
worthy
to
be
the
daughter
of
such
a
mother
grew
apace
to
the
affectionate
heart
of
the
unselfish
girl
there
seemed
no
greater
trial
than
seeing
this
dear
mother
overburdened
with
care
and
toil
but
try
as
she
might
to
take
all
the
burdens
on
her
young
shoulders
it
was
utterly
impossible
and
while
the
conviction
that
to
see
her
impatient
and
unhappy
would
add
to
her
mother
troubles
helped
her
to
maintain
her
the
reflection
that
viny
shortcomings
added
largely
to
those
trials
made
it
tenfold
more
difficult
to
bear
with
them
so
also
with
the
little
tempers
untidinesses
and
mischievous
pranks
of
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
home
even
a
happy
home
is
often
a
and
who
shall
say
that
there
is
not
sometimes
more
true
courage
displayed
there
than
in
another
kind
of
conflict
amid
the
roar
of
cannon
and
clash
of
arms
where
earthly
glory
and
renown
are
to
be
won
the
chetwoods
and
granges
and
several
others
of
the
same
standing
in
society
called
that
week
also
lord
the
minister
brought
his
old
mother
who
kept
house
for
him
he
being
a
bachelor
when
viny
happened
to
be
the
one
to
admit
callers
she
seemed
to
think
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
take
a
seat
in
the
parlor
with
them
and
exert
herself
for
their
entertainment
mildred
speedily
undertook
to
disabuse
her
of
this
impression
but
the
girl
haughtily
informed
her
that
she
had
as
good
a
right
in
the
parlor
as
anybody
else
but
i
would
go
into
it
to
visit
with
anybody
that
did
come
to
see
me
said
mildred
with
a
determined
effort
to
keep
down
her
rising
anger
well
i
guess
they
about
as
likely
to
want
to
see
me
as
any
o
the
rest
and
if
they
do
they
ought
to
so
there
but
you
have
your
work
to
attend
to
the
work
can
wait
and
the
rest
o
you
got
plenty
to
do
too
the
only
remedy
was
to
keep
viny
busy
in
the
kitchen
while
some
of
the
family
watched
the
doors
into
the
streets
and
admitted
visitors
even
this
stratagem
sometimes
failed
and
they
could
only
console
themselves
that
the
visitors
understood
the
situation
ai
you
goin
to
call
on
the
keiths
asked
gotobed
lightcap
at
the
dinner
table
one
day
about
the
middle
of
the
week
who
me
queried
his
mother
then
pushing
away
her
empty
plate
and
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
her
chin
in
her
hand
while
she
looked
reflectively
off
into
vacancy
well
i
a
body
ought
to
be
neighborly
and
i
as
willin
to
do
my
part
as
the
next
one
but
there

a
sight
of

at

and
then
i
feel
kinder
backward
callin
on

so
fine
you

apple

they

real
silver
spoons

every

that

when

have
company
well
old
woman

guess
the
victuals

no
better
for
eat
off
them
things
responded
her
husband
cheerfully
passing
his
empty
cup
maybe
and
they
do
have
no
tea
nor
coffee
for
dinner
viny
says
i
think
it
real
stingy
they
do
want
it
remarked
gotobed
do

such
thing
exclaimed
rhoda
jane
scornfully
fashionable
and
they
ruther
be
fashionable
than
comfortable
viny
says
they
awful
stuck
up
would
let
her
come
to
the
table
or
into
the
parlor
if
they
could
help
themselves
but
i
do
keer
i
not
afeard
on
if
mother
is
and
i
over
there
this
afternoon
if
it
only
to
let
see
that
i
feel
myself
as
good
as
they
be
any
day
and
i
tell
so
too
if
they
do
treat
me
right
pshaw
rhoda
jane
how
you
talk
said
her
mother
well
i
spunky
mother
that
a
fact
and
i
ai
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
nuther
do
you
go
if
you
ca
behave
yourself
said
gotobed
leaving
the
table
and
the
room
keith
had
gathered
her
children
about
her
in
the
parlor
it
being
the
shadiest
and
coolest
apartment
in
the
house
in
the
afternoon
she
herself
aunt
wealthy
and
the
little
girls
were
sewing
while
rupert
kept
the
little
boys
quiet
and
interested
with
the
making
of
a
kite
and
mildred
read
aloud
from
sherwood
roxobelle
mildred
had
a
clear
voice
enunciated
distinctly
and
read
with
feeling
and
expression
so
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
her
rupert
zillah
and
ada
were
also
good
readers
and
would
take
their
turns
as
such
for
this
was
no
new
thing
but
one
of
the
mother
ways
of
educating
her
children
and
training
them
to
a
love
of
literature
while
many
another
thing
had
been
left
behind
in
ohio
they
had
brought
all
their
books
with
them
poetry
histories
biographies
books
of
travel
religious
and
scientific
works
juvenile
and
a
few
novels
all
of
the
best
class
were
to
be
found
among
their
treasured
stores
reveled
in
by
old
and
young
keith
had
his
volumes
of
legal
lore
too
but
with
these
the
other
members
of
the
family
seldom
if
ever
cared
to
interfere
sherwood
was
a
favorite
author
with
the
young
people
they
were
reading
roxobelle
for
the
first
time
and
had
reached
a
most
exciting
part
the
scene
where
the
little
dog
had
led
sophie
beauchamp
into
the
room
where
his
invalid
and
much
abused
mistress
lay
chained
by
disease
to
her
wretched
bed
when
lightcap
and
rhoda
jane
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
they
were
dressed
with
the
utmost
simplicity
gowns
aprons
and
sunbonnets
of
calico
made
without
regard
to
fashion
no
collars
or
cuffs
hands
bare
and
brown
faces
sunburnt
the
mother
stolid
the
girl
sufficiently
sharp
but
lacking
education
and
refinement
it
was
far
from
being
a
welcome
interruption
mildred
closed
her
book
with
a
half
suppressed
sigh
the
little
girls
exchanged
glances
of
vexation
and
disappointment
rupert
too
scowled
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
impatience
half
under
his
breath
but
keith
and
miss
stanhope
rose
smilingly
gave
the
visitors
a
cordial
greeting
asked
them
to
be
seated
and
entered
into
conversation
it
powerful
warm
remarked
lightcap
accepting
the
offered
chair
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
her
heated
face
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
yes
it
has
been
an
unusually
warm
day
responded
miss
stanhope
handing
a
fan
while
keith
asked
if
they
would
not
take
off
their
bonnets
well
i
do
care
if
i
do
returned
lightcap
pulling
hers
off
and
laying
it
on
her
lap
rhoda
jane
doing
likewise
let
me
lay
them
on
the
table
mildred
said
recovering
her
politeness
no

minutes

the
girl
how

it

a
pleasant
town
and
we

pleasant
people
in

exclaimed
miss
lightcap
laughing
you

be
able
to
raise
no

year
remarked
the
mother
then
went
on
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
what
they
had
planted
what
was
growing
well
and
what
was
not
with
an
occasional
digression
to
her
husband
her
cooking
and
housework
the
occasional
attacks
of
agur
that
interfered
with
her
plans
and
so
on
and
so
on
her
daughter
managing
to
slip
in
a
word
or
two
now
and
then
at
length
they
rose
to
go
how
viny
queried
rhoda
jane
addressing
mildred
quite
well
i
believe
replied
mildred
in
a
freezing
tone
and
drawing
herself
up
with
dignity
tell
her
we
come
to
see
her
too
laughed
the
girl
as
she
stepped
from
the
door

you
wo
be
ceremonious
but
run

exclaimed
mildred
to
her
mother
with
a
flushed
and
angry
face
putting
us
and
our
maid
of
all
work
on
the

i
do

that
neither
you
nor

wealthy
will
ever
cross
their
threshold
my
dear
she
probably
did
not
mean
it
said
keith
and
now
let
us
go
on
with
our
story

their

may
run
out
and
play
in
the
yard
somebody

tumin
whispered
fan
pulling
at
her
mother
skirts
mildred
closed
again
the
book
she
had
just
resumed
rose
and
inviting
the
new
comer
to
enter
handed
her
a
chair
she
was
a
tall
gaunt
woman
of
uncertain
age
with
yellow
hair
pale
watery
blue
eyes
and
a
sanctimonious
expression
of
countenance
her
dress
was
almost
austere
in
its
simplicity
a
calico
cotton
gloves
of
a
little
darker
shade
a
white
muslin
handkerchief
crossed
on
her
bosom
a
close
straw
bonnet
with
no
trimming
but
a
skirt
of
plain
white
ribbon
and
a
piece
of
the
same
put
straight
across
the
top
brought
down
over
the
ears
and
tied
under
the
chin
my
name
is
drybread
she
announced
with
a
slight
stiff
courtesy
then
seating
herself
bolt
upright
on
mildred
offered
chair
waited
to
be
addressed
or
miss
queried
keith
pleasantly
miss
and
yours
keith
allow
me
to
introduce
my
aunt
miss
stanhope
and
my
daughter
mildred
these
little
people
too
belong
to
me

row
of
pearly
teeth
cauth

own
mamma
ai
she

my
little
man
asked
the
visitor
unbending
slightly
in
the
stiffness
of
her
manner
ai
your
man
do
like
dwy
bwead
when
vewy

cyril
my
little
boys
must
not
be
rude
reproved
the
mamma
run
away
now
to
your
plays
they
pretty
children
remarked
the
caller
as
the
twain
disappeared
very
frank
in
the
expression
of
their
sentiments
and
wishes
the
mother
responded
smiling
extremely
so
i
should
say
added
mildred
dryly
is
it
not
a
mother
duty
to
curb
and
restrain
queried
the
visitor
fixing
her
cold
blue
eyes
upon
keith
face
certainly
where
she
deems
it
needful
keith
tones
were
perfectly
mildred
not
quite
so
as
she
added
with
emphasis
and
no
one
so
capable
of
judging
when
it
is
needful
as
my
mother
quite
natural
and
proper
sentiments
for
her
daughter
no
doubt
how
do
you
like
pleasant
plains
the
question
was
addressed
more
particularly
to
miss
stanhope
and
it
was
she
who
replied
we
are
quite
disposed
to
like
the
place
miss
stalebread
the
streets
are
widely
pleasant
and
would
be
quite
beautiful
if
the
forest
trees
had
been
left
my
name
is
a
good
honest
name
if
not
quite
so
aristocratic
and
fine
sounding
as
keith
excuse
me
said
miss
stanhope
i
have
an
unfortunate
kind
of
memory
for
names
and
had
no
intention
of
miscalling
yours
oh
then
it
all
right
keith
i
a
teacher
take
young
boys
and
girls
of
all
ages
perhaps
you
might
feel
like
entrusting
me
with
some
of
yours
i
see
you
have
quite
a
flock
i
will
take
it
into
consideration
keith
answered
what
branches
do
you
teach
reading
writing
arithmetic
geography
and
english
grammar
i
heard
of
teachers
boarding
round
remarked
mildred
assailed
by
a
secret
apprehension
is
that
the
way
you
do
no
i
live
at
home
at
my
father
miss
drybread
was
scarcely
out
of
earshot
when
ada
burst
out
vehemently
i
do
want
to
be
distrusted
to
her
she
does
look
distrusty
does
she
zillah
mother
please
do
consider
it
but
just
say
yes
at
once
asked
mother
playfully
pressing
a
kiss
upon
the
little
flushed
anxious
face
oh
no
no
no
please
mamma
dear
cried
the
child
returning
the
caress
and
putting
her
arms
lovingly
about
her
mother
neck
you
did
like
her
did
you
keith
acknowledged
laughingly
that
she
had
not
been
very
favorably
impressed
and
zillah
joining
in
ada
entreaties
presently
promised
that
she
would
try
to
hear
their
lessons
at
home
a
decision
which
was
received
with
delight
and
a
profusion
of
thanks
and
caresses
mildred
was
glad
to
find
herself
alone
with
her
mother
that
evening
for
a
short
time
after
the
younger
ones
were
in
bed
for
she
had
a
plan
to
unfold
it
was
that
she
should
act
as
governess
to
her
sisters
and
the
little
boys
if
they
were
considered
old
enough
now
to
begin
the
ascent
of
the
hill
of
science
my
dear
child
the
mother
said
with
a
look
of
proud
affection
into
the
glowing
animated
face
i
fully
appreciate
the
love
and
to
me
and
the
children
that
have
prompted
this
plan
of
yours
but
i
am
by
no
means
willing
to
lay
such
heavy
burdens
on
your
young
shoulders
but
mother
wait
a
little
dearie
till
i
have
said
my
say
your
own
studies
must
be
taken
up
again
your
father
is
greatly
pleased
with
an
arrangement
he
has
just
made
for
you
and
rupert
and
zillah
to
recite
to
lord
the
english
branches
latin
greek
and
the
higher
mathematics
are
what
he
is
willing
to
undertake
to
teach
mildred
eyes
sparkled
o
mother
how
glad
i
am
will
he
open
a
school
no
only
hear
recitations
for
a
couple
of
hours
every
except
saturdays
which
he
says
he
must
have
unbroken
for
his
pulpit
preparations
your
father
thinks
he
is
very
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
add
a
little
to
his
salary
which
of
course
is
quite
small
then
we
study
at
home
i
shall
like
that
but
he
wo
take
little
ones
no
none
that
are
too
young
to
learn
latin
your
father
wants
zillah
to
begin
that
now
and
he
hopes
that
a
few
others
will
join
the
class
some
of
the
chetwoods
perhaps
mildred
face
was
all
aglow
with
delight
for
she
had
a
great
thirst
for
knowledge
and
there
had
seemed
small
hope
of
satisfying
it
in
this
little
frontier
town
where
the
means
for
acquiring
a
liberal
education
were
so
scant
and
poor
so
you
see
daughter
you
will
have
no
lack
of
employment
keith
went
on
especially
as
with
such
inefficient
help
in
the
kitchen
and
with
general
housework
i
shall
often
be
compelled
to
call
upon
you
or
rather
she
added
with
a
slight
caress
to
accept
the
assistance
you
are
only
too
ready
to
give
it
is
too
bad
cried
the
girl
indignantly
that
viny
does
earn
her
salt
i
wonder
how
you
can
have
patience
with
her
mother
if
i
were
her
mistress
i
have
sent
her
off
at
a
moment
warning
long
before
this
let
us
try
to
imitate
god
patience
with
us
which
is
infinite
keith
answered
low
and
reverently
let
us
bear
with
her
a
little
longer
but
indeed
i
do
not
know
that
we
could
fill
her
place
with
any
one
who
would
be
more
competent
or
satisfactory
in
any
way
i
afraid
that
is
quite
true
but
it
does
seem
too
hard
that
such
a
woman
as
my
gifted
intellectual
accomplished
mother
should
have
to
spend
her
life
in
the
drudgery
of
housework
cooking
mending
and
taking
care
of
babies
no
dear
you
are
taking
a
wrong
view
of
it
god
appoints
our
lot
he
chooses
all
our
changes
for
us
jesus
the
dignified
manual
labor
by
making
it
his
own
employment
during
a
great
part
of
his
life
on
earth
and
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
master
and
the
servant
as
his
lord
besides
what
sweeter
work
can
a
mother
have
than
the
care
and
training
of
her
own
offspring
but
then
the
cooking
mother
and
all
the
rest
of
it
well
dear
the
health
and
consequently
the
happiness
and
usefulness
of
my
husband
and
children
depend
very
largely
upon
the
proper
preparation
of
their
food
so
that
is
no
mean
task
ah
mother
you
are
determined
to
make
out
a
good
case
and
not
to
believe
yourself
hardly
used
said
mildred
smiling
yet
speaking
in
a
half
petulant
tone
no
i
am
not
hardly
used
my
life
is
crowned
with
mercies
of
the
very
least
of
which
i
am
utterly
unworthy
her
mother
answered
gently
and
my
child
i
find
that
any
work
is
sweet
when
done
as
to
the
lord
and
not
unto
men
what
sweeter
than
a
service
of
love
ye
followers
of
god
as
dear
children
yes
said
aunt
wealthy
coming
in
at
the
moment
dear
children
not
as
servants
or
slaves
but
doing
the
will
of
god
from
the
heart
not
that
we
may
be
saved
but
because
we
are
saved
our
obedience
not
the
ground
of
our
acceptance
but
the
proof
of
our
love
to
him
our
faith
in
him
who
freely
gives
us
the
redemption
purchased
for
us
by
his
own
blood
oh
what
a
blessed
religion
it
is
how
sweet
to
belong
to
jesus
and
to
owe
everything
to
him
i
feel
it
so
keith
said
with
an
undertone
of
deep
joy
in
her
sweet
voice
and
i
whispered
mildred
laying
her
head
in
her
mother
lap
as
she
knelt
at
her
side
as
had
been
her
wont
in
childish
days
they
were
all
silent
after
that
for
many
minutes
sitting
there
in
the
gloaming
keith
hand
passing
softly
caressingly
over
her
daughter
hair
and
cheeks
then
mildred
spoke
let
me
try
it
mother
dear
teaching
the
children
i
mean
you
know
there
is
nothing
helps
one
more
to
be
thorough
and
i
want
to
fit
myself
for
teaching
if
ever
i
should
have
my
own
living
to
earn
well
well
my
child
you
may
try
that
my
own
dear
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
joyfully
starting
up
to
catch
and
kiss
the
hand
that
had
been
caressing
her
now
i
must
arrange
my
plans
i
shall
have
to
be
very
systematic
in
order
to
do
all
i
wish
yes
said
miss
stanhope
one
can
accomplish
very
little
without
system
but
often
a
great
deal
with
it
mildred
set
to
work
with
cheerfulness
and
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
determination
and
showed
herself
not
easily
conquered
by
difficulties
the
rest
of
that
week
was
given
to
planning
and
preparing
for
her
work
and
on
the
following
monday
her
long
neglected
studies
were
resumed
and
her
duties
as
family
governess
entered
upon
these
took
up
the
morning
from
nine
to
twelve
but
by
early
rising
and
diligence
she
was
able
to
do
a
good
deal
about
the
house
before
the
hour
for
lessons
to
begin
her
mother
insisted
that
she
must
have
an
hour
for
recreation
every
afternoon
taking
a
walk
when
the
weather
permitted
then
another
for
study
and
the
two
with
lord
left
but
a
small
margin
for
anything
else
the
sewing
and
reading
with
mother
and
sisters
usually
filled
out
the
remainder
of
the
day
sometimes
her
plans
worked
well
and
she
was
able
to
go
through
the
round
of
duties
with
satisfaction
to
herself
and
to
that
of
her
mother
and
aunt
who
looked
on
with
great
interest
and
were
ever
on
the
watch
to
lend
a
helping
hand
and
keep
hindrances
out
of
her
way
but
these
last
would
come
now
and
again
in
the
shape
of
callers
accidents
mischievous
pranks
on
the
part
of
the
little
ones
or
delinquencies
on
that
of
the
maid
of
all
work
till
at
times
patience
and
determination
were
sorely
tried
she
would
grow
discouraged
be
nearly
ready
to
give
up
then
summon
all
her
energies
to
the
task
battle
with
her
difficulties
and
for
a
time
rise
superior
to
them
but
a
new
foe
appeared
upon
the
field
and
vanquished
her
it
was
the
ague
attacking
now
one
and
now
another
of
the
family
soon
they
were
seldom
all
well
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
two
or
three
to
be
down
with
it
at
once
viny
took
it
and
left
and
they
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
governessing
had
to
be
given
up
nursing
and
housework
substituted
for
that
and
for
sewing
and
reading
while
still
for
some
weeks
longer
the
lessons
with
lord
were
kept
up
but
at
length
they
also
had
to
be
dropped
for
mildred
herself
succumbed
to
the
malaria
and
grew
too
weak
ill
and
depressed
for
study

shaks
king
lear
the
neighbors
were
very
kind
coming
in
with
offers
of
assistance
in
nursing
the
sick
bringing
dainties
to
tempt
their
appetites
encouraging
them
with
the
assurance
that
they
were

sharing
the
common
lot
almost
everybody
expected
a
chill
about
once
in
two
or
three
weeks
especially
this
time
of
year
and
they
were
often
disappointed
and
thought
themselves
fortunate
if
they
could
stop
at
one
paroxysm
till
the
week
came
round
again
quinine
would
generally
stop
it
and
when
people
had
a
long
siege
of
the
ague
they
often
got
used
to
it
so
far
as
to
manage
to
keep
up
and
about
their
work
if
not
at
all
times
at

between
the
chills
which
as
a
general
thing
came
only
every
other
day
indeed
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
them
to
feel
quite
bright
and
well
on
the
intermediate
day
the
lightcaps
were
not
a
whit
behind
the
others
in
these
little
acts
of
kindness
rhoda
jane
forgot
her
envy
of
mildred
on
learning
that
she
was
sick
and
seemed
to
have
lost
her
relish
for
food
one
morning
miss
stanhope
who
was
getting
breakfast
was
favored
with
an
early
call
from
miss
lightcap
she
appeared
at
the
open
kitchen
door
basket
in
hand
and
marched
in
without
stopping
to
knock
i
heerd
miss
mildred
was
sick
and

she
said
and
i
knowed

nightcap
said
aunt
wealthy
looking

pleased
and
grateful
that
the
girl
could
not
take
the
misnomer
as
an
intentional
insult
pshaw
she
said
it
nothin
we
plenty
of
having
emptied
her
basket
upon
the
table
she
was
starting
for
the
door
but
looked
back
say
do
you
want
a
girl
yes
indeed
if
we
can
get
one
that
worth
anything
well
celestia
ann
hunsinger

she
was
scarcely
gone
when
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
opened
and
mildred
pale
face
appeared
aunt
wealthy
it
is
too
bad
to

be
worse
than
a
brute
if
i
did
go
into
the
and
lie
down
on
the
lounge
she
continued
taking
up
one
of
the
finest
tomatoes
and
beginning
to
divest
it
of
its
skin
and
i
bring
you
something
presently
that
i
really
hope
will
taste
good
to
you
that
miss
heavycap
brought
you
a
present
she
not
over
refined
but
i
think
in
spite
of
her
rude
ways
and
rough
talk
yes
they
have
been
very
kind
and
neighborly
i
wish
they
were
the
sort
of
people
one
could
enjoy
being
intimate
with
mildred
said
languidly
auntie
let
me
skin
those
tomatoes

ready
to
drop

i
smiling
faintly
well

sit
down
to

the
i

the
oven

here

i
learned
how
cried
rupert
exultingly
stepping
in
at
the
open
door
and
holding
up
a
foaming
bucket
of
milk
viny
never
persuaded
old
suky
to
give
us
so
much
it
beautiful
said
aunt
wealthy
taking
it
from
him
with
a
congratulatory
smile
i
strain
it
at
once
before
the
cream
begins
to
rise
i
carry
the
pans
down
cellar
and
what
more
can
i
do
auntie
you
may
draw
the
butter
up
out
of
the
well
presently
when
breakfast
is
quite
ready
and
let
it
down
again
when
the
meal
over
hello
milly
is
that
you
how
white
and
weak
you
look
yes
she
said
laying
the
last
tomato
in
the
dish
i
believe
have
to
lie
down
as
aunt
wealthy
bade
me
till
breakfast
is
ready
she
tottered
into
the
and
laid
herself
down
on
the
lounge
feeling
so
miserably
weak
and
forlorn
so
homesick
for
the
old
home
where
they
had
all
enjoyed
good
health
that
the
tears
would
come
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
restrain
them
breakfast
was
to
be
eaten
here
the
table
was
already
set
neatly
too
with
snowy
cloth
shining
silver
and
delicate
china
but
there
was
a
look
of
discomfort
about
the
room
that
vexed
and
tried
her
orderly
soul
sand
on
the
carpet
dust
on
the
furniture
children
toys
and
a
few
articles
of
clothing
scattered
here
and
there
and
she
had
no
strength
to
rise
and
put
it
in
order
and
no
one
else
is
much
better
able
she
sighed
to
herself
for
aunt
wealthy
mother
and
zillah
have
all
had
chills
within
a
week
oh
dear
this
dreadful
country
why
did
we
ever
come
to
it
she
heard
her
father
voice
in
the
kitchen
here
aunt
wealthy
is
some
steak
rather
better
than
usual
i
think
can
we
have
a
bit
broiled
for
breakfast
and
miss
stanhope
cheery
tones
in
reply
yes
stuart
i
put
it
right
on
i
so
glad
you
succeeded
in
getting
some
fresh
meat
it
something
of
a
rarity
to
us
in
these
days
and
i
hope
they
all
relish
it
marcia
and
milly
especially
for
they
both
need
something
to
build
up
their
strength
where
are
they
not
able
to
be
up
his
tone
was
anxious
and
concerned
mildred
did
not
catch
the
words
of
miss
stanhope
reply
but
the
door
opened
her
father
came
to
her
side
stooped
over
her
and
kissed
her
pale
cheek
tenderly
how
are
you
daughter
do
be
discouraged
we
have
you
all
right
before
long
o
father
i
so
out
of
heart
she
sobbed
raising
herself
to
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
lay
her
head
on
his
shoulder
oh
that
wo
do
you
must
be
brave
and
hopeful
he
said
stroking
her
hair
you
not
so
very
ill
my
child
ague
is
not
a
dangerous
disease
it
is
that
but
there
so
much
to
be
done
and
nobody
to
do
it
we
all
so
poorly
do
fret
about
the
work
we
find
some
one
to
do
it
but
they
do
do
it
right
viny
never
would
spread
up
a
bed
straight
or
sweep
or
dust
without
leaving
half
the
dirt
behind
her
and
when
she
washed
she
faded
the
calicoes
shrank
the
flannels
and
made
the
white
clothes
a
wretched
color
though
she
tore
them
to
pieces
with
hard
rubbing
and
wringing
well
we
have
just
to
try
not
to
mind
these
trifles
or
be
too
particular
he
said
soothingly
ah
here
comes
the
breakfast
as
miss
stanhope
rupert
zillah
and
ada
trooped
in
each
bearing
a
dish
let
me
help
you
to
the
table
i
do
feel
in
the
least
hungry
she
objected
then
eat
to
please
father
and
mother
too
said
keith
coming
in
with
baby
annis
in
her
arms
come
daughter
dear
auntie
has
prepared
an
excellent
meal
for
us
with
some
help
from
our
kind
neighbors
too
i
hear
yes
assented
miss
stanhope
and
i
directed
them
according
to
preparations
and
they
do
taste
good
come
now
when
i
see
you
eating
i
tell
you
a
bit
of
news
the
girl
brought
besides
mildred
laughed
felt
her
spirits
begin
to
rise
tasted
the
tomatoes
pronounced
them
excellent
and
went
on
to
make
a
good
hearty
meal
the
world
looked
brighter
after
that
it
had
been
decided
to
try
miss
hunsinger
if
she
could
be
got
keith
went
in
search
of
her
shortly
after
breakfast
and
within
an
hour
she
was
duly
installed
into
office
she
was
a
tall
strong
woman
with
a
large
proportion
of
bone
and
muscle
ditto
of
and
impudence
united
to
uncommon
energy
and
decision
and
a
faculty
of
turning
off
a
great
amount
of
work
doing
it
thoroughly
well
too
at
first
she
seemed
a
great
improvement
upon
viny
and
mildred
heart
rejoiced
in
a
complete
sweeping
dusting
and
setting
to
rights
of
the
whole
house
the
children
had
been
sent
out
to
play
in
the
shade
of
the
sapling
grove
while
keith
superintended
the
operations
of
the
new
help
and
miss
stanhope
and
mildred
in
the
parlor
busied
themselves
the
one
with
the
week
mending
for
the
family
the
other
over
her
sometime
neglected
studies
she
a
real
new
broom
is
my
celestia
ann
said
keith
coming
cheerily
in
leaves
no
dirty
corners
or
cobwebs
no
wrinkles
in
sheets
or
spreads
o
mother
what
a
blessing
cried
mildred
if
she
only
stay
so
ah
there
the
rub
she
can
not
be
a
rose
without
a
thorn
what
was
it
rhoda
jane
said
of
her
aunt
wealthy
the
old
lady
reflected
a
moment
ere
she
answered
large
potatoes
i
think
it
was
marcia
and
i
understood
it
to
mean
that
she
was
a
good
worker
something
also
that
gave
me
the
impression
that
she
might
be
and
saucy
but
as
you
say
we
can
not
expect
thorns
without
roses
she
getting
dinner
now
remarked
keith
and
seems
to
feel
as
much
at
home
there
as
about
her
other
work
i
told
her
what
to
get
and
showed
her
where
everything
is
and
now
i
shall
leave
her
to
her
own
devices
and
see
what
will
be
the
result
half
an
hour
later
the
door
of
the
parlor
where
now
the
whole
family
were
gathered
was
thrown
open
with
the
announcement
dinner
ready
all
on
the
table
here
having
given
the
summons
miss
hunsinger
rushed
back
to
the
table
in
advance
of
the
family
seated
herself
spread
out
her
elbows
upon
it
and
with
a
nonchalant
air
said
come
folks
it
all
ready
set
right
up
there
was
a
rapid
exchange
of
glances
among
the
party
addressed
but
not
a
word
of
remonstrance
or
disapproval
was
uttered
physically
unequal
to
the
work
that
must
be
done
they
were
helpless
in
the
hands
of
their
help
the
meal
was
begun
in
a
profound
silence
which
she
was
the
first
to
break
ther
some
hot
biscuits
out
thar
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
toward
the
kitchen
door
you
may
bring
some
in
said
keith
just
let
one
o
your
gals
do
it
this
time
i
will
next
turn
about
fair
play
you
know
mildred
eyes
flashed
and
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
then
closed
them
firmly
as
she
thought
of
the
consequences
to
her
mother
and
aunt
should
this
girl
be
sent
away
before
she
was
able
to
take
up
even
a
part
of
the
burden
of
the
work
i
go
mother
said
zillah
hastily
leaving
her
place
i
do
mind
it
but
if
i
were
paid
for
doing
it
i
would
want
to
earn
my
money
by
doing
it
myself
well
my
dear
what
do
you
think
of
your
new
help
queried
keith
mischievously
when
they
had
withdrawn
to
the
privacy
of
the
parlor
the
thorn
is
rather
large
and
sharp
she
answered
laughing
but
we
are
not
the
only
people
in
the
world
who
must
make
a
choice
of
evils
for
my
part
said
mildred
severely
i
think
it
a
species
of
dishonesty
to
take
pay
for
doing
the
work
of
a
family
and
then
ask
them
to
do
it
themselves
are
you
a
trifle
too
hard
on
her
dear
said
miss
stanhope
it
was
very
forward
and
impertinent
but
i
think
hardly
dishonest
because
she
is
not
expected
to
do
quite
all
the
work
of
the
family
here
comes
emmaretta
lightcap
said
ada
who
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
she
has
an
old
faded
calico
dress
and
sunbonnet
and
bare
feet
just
as
usual
and
a
tin
pan
in
her
hands
come
in
emmaretta
the
little
girl
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
approaching
keith
said
here
more
tomats
mother

you
and
a
bird
for
her
pointing
to
mildred
gote

out
shootin
and
he
sent
it
to
her
he
very
kind
take
him
my
thanks
for
it
said
mildred
coloring
and
vexed
with
herself
for
doing
so
please
tell
your
sister
too
that
i
thank
her
for
the
tomatoes
and
that
i
liked
them
very
much
are
you
a
comin
to
our
school
cause
miss
damaris
she
said

said
the
child
turning
to
ada
while
waiting
for
her
pan
which
zillah
had
carried
away
to
empty
it
no
no

cried
ada
i
do
like
her
and
would
go

for
anything
hush
hush
ada
you

miss
drybread
said
keith
quite
surprised
at
the
outbreak
yes
mother
do
you
remember
she
was
here
one
day
rhoda
jane
she
comin
over
to
see
you

evenin
said
the
little
maid
taking
her
pan
and
departing
mildred
countenance
fell
she
appreciated
rhoda
jane
kindness
but
could
not
enjoy
her
society
why
ada
said
keith
i
knew
nothing
of
your
dislike
to
miss
drybread
and
so
when
she
met
me
in
the
street
this
morning
and
asked
me
to
send
her
a
scholar
i
thought
of
milly
sickness
and
that
she
must
not
have
so
much
to
do
and
promised
that
you
should
go
o
father
exclaimed
the
child
beginning
to
cry
then
they
all
tried
to
comfort
her
and
finally
she
grew
in
a
measure
reconciled
to
her
fate

chapter
thirteenth
is
with
our
judgments
as
our
watches
none
go
just
alike
yet
each
believes
his
own
pope
you
hai
returned
our
fust
call
and
then
you
did
stay
but
ten
minutes
rhoda
jane
said
in
a
tone
to
mildred
and
we
such
near
neighbors
too
we
ought
to
be
real
sociable
mildred
apologized
by
stating
the
fact
that
her
time
was
very
fully
occupied
well
you
and
claudina
chetwood
seems
to
be
pretty
thick
but
the
chetwoods
is
we
are
an
i
that
makes
it
easier
to
find
time
to
visit
with
the
riches
do
make
any
difference
said
mildred
flushing
and
i
heard
that
the
chetwoods
are
not
very
rich
well
they
hold
their
heads
high
anyway
i
agoin
to
have
a
rag
carpet
party
pretty
soon
and
give
you
an
invite
and
if
you
do
come
i
be
so
mad
i
wo
never
come
near
you
again
perhaps
i
may
be
sick
sighed
mildred
half
hoping
in
her
secret
heart
that
so
it
might
fall
out
oh
then
of
course
i
could
be
mad
but
i
try
to
fix
it
when
you
well
when
is
it
to
be
and
what
is
it
like
soon
mother
and
me
gits
the
rags
all
cut
a
week
from
now
i
reckon
why
a
passel
o
girls
gits
together
and
sews
the
rags
and
winds
up
into
balls
and
after
awhile
the
boys
come
in
and
then
we
have
lots
o
fun
and
good
things
to
eat
now
i
must
run
home
mind
you
to
be
sure
to
come
this
was
friday
on
the
ensuing
monday
morning
little
ada
set
out
sorrowfully
for
miss
drybread
school
in
company
with
emmaretta
and
minerva
lightcap
mildred
was
alone
in
the
parlor
when
the
child
came
back
at
noon
well
pussy
how
did
you
like
it
she
asked
with
a
sympathetic
smile
not
at
all
o
mildred
she
is
a
lady
or
a
christian
for
she
deceives
she
acts
lies
she
made
a
naughty
girl
believe
she
was
going
to
roast
her
to
death
there
a
stove
and
a
big
oven
in
it
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
put
her
in
there
and
build
up
a
hot
fire
and
cook
her
did
the
girl
believe
it
yes
she
was
dreadfully
frightened
she
screamed
like
everything
and
promised
that
indeed
and
indeed
she
be
good
and
miss
drybread
let
her
go
to
her
seat
that
was
acting
a
lie
and
telling
one
too
and
anybody
who
would
do
so
is
unfit
to
have
the
care
of
children
said
mildred
i
shall
tell
father
and
mother
about
it
and
i
very
sure
they
wo
send
you
any
longer
than
this
one
quarter
anyhow
mildred
she
does
look
like
a
lady
either
she
does
wear
anything
white
round
her
neck
just
a
pink
calico
cape
and
an
apron
of
the
same
and
another
kind
of
calico
dress
no
matter
about
that
if
she
only
acted
and
talked
right
she
neat
and
clean
i
suppose
yes
i
did
see
any
soil
on
her
clothes
well
learn
your
lessons
well
and
behave
nicely
so
that
she
ca
find
any
excuse
for
ill
treating
you
mildred
looked
upon
the
expected
carpet
rag
party
with
nearly
as
great
aversion
as
ada
felt
for
her
new
school
but
was
a
good
deal
relieved
on
learning
from
claudina
chetwood
that
she
too
had
been
notified
of
its
approach
and
expected
to
attend
i
did
know
that
you
visited
the
lightcaps
said
mildred
oh
yes
they
are
not
cultivated
people
or
very
refined
but
clever
folks
and
kind
neighbors
especially
in
times
of
sickness
and
would
feel
dreadfully
hurt
if
one
should
decline
their
invitations
they
not
the
sort
of
people
we
exchange
formal
calls
with
indeed
they
never
make
them
but
as
mother
says
while
society
here
is
in
the
crude
state
it
is
now
it
will
not
do
to
insist
upon
making
associates
of
those
only
who
are
congenial
or
quite
belong
to
our
station
in
life
yes
we
can
not
divide
up
into
many
circles
and
must
be
willing
to
mix
to
some
extent
with
all
who
can
lay
claim
to
respectability
and
moral
worth
i
afraid
i
very
proud
said
mildred
laughing
and
blushing
never
been
used
to
associating
with
any
one
so
rough
and
uncouth
and
it
goes
a
good
deal
against
the
grain
perhaps
it
is
exactly
pride
suggested
claudina
they
offend
your
taste
they
do
mine
i
know
but
surely
we
can
bear
that
rather
than
give
them
the
pain
of
thinking
that
we
despise
them
yes
indeed
assented
mildred
heartily
and
from
that
moment
ceased
to
allow
herself
to
hope
that
something
would
occur
to
give
her
a
plausible
excuse
for
staying
away
from
rhoda
jane
she
repeated
claudina
remarks
to
her
mother
and
aunt
and
found
that
they
fully
approved
of
the
sentiments
she
had
expressed
time
was
when
i
should
have
been
very
unwilling
to
see
you
consort
with
that
class
on
terms
of
equality
said
keith
but
circumstances
alter
cases
the
invitation
came
for
friday
afternoon
and
evening
rhoda
jane
hailing
rupert
as
he
passed
and
sending
it
through
him
mildred
was
nearly
in
her
usual
health
and
accepted
without
a
demur
but
puzzled
to
know
what
to
wear
and
at
what
hour
to
go
went
to
claudina
for
instruction
on
these
important
points
we
are
invited
to
work
you
know
said
miss
chetwood
laughing
so
will
be
expected
early
we
should
not
be
later
than
one
i
think
and
as
it
is
not
very
nice
work
carpet
rags
being
apt
to
be
dusty
we
should
not
wear
anything
that
will
not
wash
i
shall
put
on
a
calico
dress
and
carry
a
big
work
apron
with
me
then
i
shall
do
the
same
i
wish
you
would
for
there
will
be
some
girls
there
who
have
the
means
to
dress
and
would
feel
badly
if
you
or
i
outshone
them
very
much
i
ca
go
before
three
or
though
on
account
of
having
to
recite
to
mr
lord
never
mind
i
daresay
it
just
as
well
for
you
get
quite
enough
of
both
the
work
and
the
company
following
out
the
instructions
received
mildred
attired
herself
for
the
occasion
with
the
utmost
simplicity
but
could
not
lay
aside
her
delicate
prettiness
or
a
certain
air
of
culture
and
refinement
that
made
her
more
the
real
lady
in
her
calico
than
almost
any
of
her
companions
of
the
afternoon
would
have
been
in
the
richest
silk
or
velvet
just
as
she
was
ready
to
go
ada
came
in
from
school
crying
heartily
what
the
matter
asked
mildred
meeting
her
on
the
threshold
and
turning
back
full
of
sympathy
i
i
lost
my
place
in
the
sobbed
the
child
and
i
did
miss
a
word
either
you
know
i
got
up
head
the
first
day
and
i
kept
there
ever
since
above
all
those
big
big
girls
some
of
as
big
as
you
milly
but
how
did
you
get
down
if
you
did
miss
was
it
for
bad
behavior
no
but
she
upset
the
class
and
made
us
all
draw
lots
for
our
places
and
the
one
i
drew
made
my
place
next
to
the
foot
mother
do
you
hear
that
asked
mildred
hotly
for
anything
like
abuse
or
unjust
treatment
of
her
little
brothers
or
sisters
was
sure
to
rouse
her
ire
yes
keith
said
but
ada
you
like
the
fun
of
getting
up
in
your
class
and
you
could
never
have
that
if
you
were
always
at
the
head
this
seemed
a
new
idea
to
the
child
and
she
smiled
faintly
through
her
tears
but
the
wound
was
so
deep
it
must
bleed
awhile
and
the
briny
drops
fell
fast
again
she
was
an
uncommonly
good
speller
for
a
child
of
her
age
and
had
taken
great
pride
in
keeping
her
place
working
very
hard
to
be
able
to
do
so
and
this
sudden
unexpected
downfall
due
to
no
failure
on
her
part
almost
overwhelmed
her
with
a
sense
of
loss
humiliation
and
injustice
mildred
waited
she
could
bear
to
go
and
leave
ada
in
such
distress
do
cry
she
said
stroking
her
hair
caressingly
while
the
mother
wiped
away
the
fast
flowing
tears
with
her
own
soft
white
handkerchief
and
kissed
the
flushed
cheek
do
cry
you
soon
get
up
again
and
i
shall
write
a
note
to
miss
drybread
telling
her
that
i
can
not
approve
of
drawing
lots
to
decide
so
trivial
a
matter
said
keith
it
seems
to
me
very
wrong
because
it
is
an
appeal
to
god
lot
is
cast
into
the
lap
but
the
whole
disposing
thereof
is
of
the
lord
it
might
be
well
enough
to
turn
the
class
round
occasionally
or
in
some
other
way
to
give
the
poor
scholars
a
chance
to
rise
but
this
proceeding
i
so
highly
disapprove
of
that
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
take
part
in
it
again
i
wish
you
take
me
away
out
of
her
school
mother
oh
do
pleaded
the
little
girl
you
shall
not
be
kept
there
long
keith
said
but
mildred
child
she
added
gayly
you
must
hurry
away
or
i
fear
you
not
earn
your
supper
a
dozen
maidens
mostly
under
twenty
years
of
age
were
collected
in
the
front
room
at
lightcap
a
large
clothes
basket
filled
with
many
colored
rags
torn
or
cut
into
strips
of
various
lengths
occupied
a
conspicuous
place
upon
the
floor
a
number
of
girls
were
grouped
about
it
and
armed
with
needles
and
thread
scissors
and
thimbles
were
busily
engaged
picking
out
the
strips
sewing
the
ends
together
and
winding
the
long
strings
thus
formed
into
balls
others
had
filled
their
laps
and
seated
themselves
here
and
there
about
the
room
they
seemed
a
very
merry
company
laughing
and
chatting
as
they
worked
oh
how
d
do
said
rhoda
jane
catching
sight
of
mildred
as
she
drew
near
the
door
which
was
standing
open
thought
you
was
at
all
walk
right
in
let
me
take
your
sunbonnet
here
a
seat
for
you
side
of
miss
chetwood
guess
you
better
acquainted
with
her
than
any
body
else
without
it
viny
apple
ladies
this
is
miss
keith
i
do
need
no
hintroduction
laughed
miss
apple
you
well
miss
milly
the
others
looked
up
with
a
nod
and
a
murmured
word
or
two
as
rhoda
jane
named
each
in
turn
then
they
seemed
to
take
up
the
thread
of
their
discourse
where
it
had
been
dropped
while
mildred
tied
on
her
apron
took
the
chair
assigned
her
threaded
a
needle
and
helping
herself
by
invitation
from
claudina
lap
began
her
first
ball
at
the
same
time
explaining
that
her
lessons
had
detained
her
you
must
be
goin
to
be
dreadful
learned
commented
rhoda
jane
filling
mildred
lap
from
the
basket
i
would
be
you
for
something
i
hate
books
and
always
did
are
we
all
here
now
asked
some
one
all
but
damaris
drybread
she
oldish
for
the
rest
of
us
but
the
you
know
and
likes
to
be
invited
and
though
late
comin
yonder
she
is
now
she
works
dreadful
fast
when
she
does
get
at
it
mildred
overheard
a
whisper
not
complimentary
to
the
coming
woman
pshaw
i
wish
she
had
been
asked
she
spoils
everything
for
as
solemn
as
a
funeral
and
to
think
it
a
sin
to
laugh
yes
assented
another
voice
that
so
and
she
never
forgets
that
she
a
but
takes
it
upon
herself
to
tell
you
your
duty
without
waiting
to
be
invited
to
but
now
miss
drybread
was
upon
the
threshold
good
evening
she
said
in
solemn
tone
and
with
a
stiff
little
bow
addressing
her
salutation
to
the
company
in
general
then
giving
her
sunbonnet
to
rhoda
jane
she
seated
herself
in
her
usual
bolt
upright
manner
and
fell
to
work
her
presence
acted
as
a
damper
upon
the
spirits
of
the
younger
portion
of
the
party
a
dead
silence
succeeded
the
merry
chatter
and
laughter
of
a
moment
before
mildred
had
cared
little
for
that
while
it
went
on
but
it
vexed
her
now
that
this
woman
for
whom
principally
on
ada
account
she
began
to
feel
a
decided
dislike
should
have
it
in
her
power
thus
to
spoil
the
enjoyment
of
others
and
she
determined
that
it
should
not
be
raising
her
voice
that
all
might
hear
she
told
an
amusing
anecdote
that
set
everybody
to
laughing
except
the
whose
increasing
solemnity
of
aspect
seemed
to
reprove
their
levity
oh
that
was
do
tell
us
another
cried
rhoda
jane
holding
her
sides
i
had
no
idea
you
could
be
so
funny
mildred
went
on
with
anecdotes
jests
conundrums
claudina
and
one
or
two
others
contributing
their
quota
also
till
with
the
ruder
ones
the
mirth
became
somewhat
boisterous
as
it
died
down
again
miss
drybread
spoke
life
permit
me
to
observe
to
you
all
is
too
serious
and
solemn
to
be
spent
in
laughing
and
joking
allow
me
to
say
miss
keith
that
i
am
astonished
that
you
a
church
member
should
indulge
in
such
frivolity
do
you
think
a
christian
should
always
wear
a
long
face
asked
mildred
saucily
her
countenance
showing
all
too
plainly
the
contempt
and
aversion
she
felt
for
her
censor
yes
i
think
that
folks
that
profess
that
they
got
religion
ought
to
be
grave
and
sober
and
let
the
world
see
that
they
do
belong
to
it
as
if
there
was
any
harm
in
innocent
mirth
exclaimed
mildred
as
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
world
with
so
good
a
right
to
be
glad
and
happy
as
one
who
knows
that
jesus
loves
him
in
the
lord
ye
righteous
and
shout
for
joy
all
ye
that
are
upright
in
heart
the
bible
is
full
of
commands
to
god
people
to
rejoice
to
be
glad
to
sing
for
joy
and
the
best
christians
i
know
seem
to
me
the
happiest
people
on
earth
you
rather
young
to
set
up
your
judgment
as
to
who
the
best
christian
and
who
got
religion
and
who
has
returned
the
spinster
bridling
well
none
o
your
christians
for
me
exclaimed
rhoda
jane
i
never
want
to
get
religion
till
the
last
minute
if
i
was
to
be
to
laugh
and
joke
no
more
i
can
not
read
the
heart
nor
can
any
other
human
creature
said
mildred
replying
to
miss
drybread
last
remark
but
jesus
says
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
that
keepeth
my
commandments
he
it
is
that
loveth
me
and
when
you
live
with
people
and
see
them
constantly
serving
god
with
gladness
walking
in
his
ways
rejoicing
in
his
love
making
the
bible
always
their
rule
of
faith
and
practice
showing
far
more
solicitude
about
heavenly
than
about
earthly
things
both
for
themselves
and
their
children
i
think
you
may
be
very
sure
they
are
real
christians
i
think
so
too
said
claudina
emphatically
so
do
i
and
i
chimed
in
several
other
voices
but
do
you
know
any
such
folks
i
have
been
describing
my
father
and
mother
mildred
said
and
my
dear
aunt
wealthy
too
that
a
fact
spoke
up
viny
you
to
live
with
folks
to
find
out
and
i
lived
there
and
i
never
seen
better
christians
they
keep
their
religion
for
sundays
but
keith
reads
in
the
good
book
hevery
night
and
mornin
and
prays
just
like
a
minister
honly
not
so
long
and
they
sing
and
i
never
a
cross
word
pass
between
and
keith
or
heither
and
they
never
threaten
the
children
they
do
something
hawful
like
breakin
their
bones
or
skinnin
of
alive
has
some
folks
does
but
just
speaks
to
quiet
like
sayin
exactly
what
they
mean
and
they
always
minded
too

rhoda

seems
to
me

for

some
preparation
said
mildred
dropping
hers
and
looking
at
her
hands
oh

said
rhoda
jane
leading
the
way
a
tin
bucket
full
of
water
a
dipper
and
washbasin
all
bright
from
a
recent
scouring
stood
on
a
bench
in
the
shed
at
the
outer
kitchen
door
a
piece
of
brown
soap
lay
there
also
and
a
clean
crash
towel
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
close
by
the
girls
used
these
in
turn
laughing
and
chatting
merrily
the
while
then
gathered
about
the
table
which
was
bountifully
spread
with
good
plain
country
fare
chicken
ham
dried
beef
pickles
tomatoes
cucumbers
and
radishes
cheese
eggs
pie
cake
and
preserves
in
several
varieties
hot
cakes
and
cold
bread
tea
and
coffee
none
of
the
family
partook
with
their
guests
except
rhoda
jane
they
would
eat
afterwards
and
lightcap
busied
herself
now
in
waiting
upon
the
table
filling
the
tea
and
coffee
cups
in
the
shed
where
the
cooking
stove
stood
during
the
months
of
the
year
when
its
heat
was
objectionable
in
the
house
i
do
know
as
we
earned
our
supper
mis
lightcap
remarked
one
of
the
girls
stirring
her
tea

i

said
rhoda
jane
what
boys
queried
mildred
whereat
several
of
the
girls
giggled
why
the
fellows
of
course
laughed
miss
lightcap
the
boys
is
what
we
mostly
call
though
some
of
pretty
old
i
should
judge
for
that
yes
there
rocap
stubblefield
must
be
thirty
at
least
said
one
and
nick
ransquattle
if
he
a
day
remarked
another
well
the
rest
young
enough
said
lightcap
pass
that
cake
there
rhoda
jane
there
my
gotobed
just
turned
and
york
mocker
and
wallace
ormsby
and
claudina
brother
will
all
younger
by
some
months
or
a
year
or
so
the
meal
concluded
the
work
went
on
quite
briskly
again
mildred
catching
now
and
then
a
whispered
word
or
two
about
the
desirableness
of
getting
through
with
it
in
time
to
have
some
fun
but
the
raw
material
for
several
more
balls
still
remained
in
the
basket
when
the
boys
began
to
come
gotobed
was
naturally
among
the
first
he
was
quite
slicked
up
as
rhoda
jane
elegantly
expressed
it
though
his
toilet
had
been
made
under
difficulties
the
only
legitimate
way
of
reaching
the
second
story
and
his
sunday
clothes
was
by
a
stairway
leading
up
from
the
front
room
where
the
girls
were
the
windows
of
his
bedroom
however
looked
out
upon
the
leanto
which
formed
the
kitchen
part
of
the
building
and
whose
roof
was
not
many
feet
higher
than
that
of
the
shed
watching
his
opportunity
for
doing
so
unseen
he
climbed
upon
the
shed
gained
the
roof
of
the
leanto
and
entered
his
room
by
the
window
there
was
nothing
of
the
dandy
about
the
honest
fellow
yet
somehow
dressing
was
a
slow
business
with
him
he
stood
before
a
little
square
of
hanging
on
the
wall
tying
and
retying
his
cravat
till
it
was
too
dark
to
see
then
giving
up
in
sheer
despair
went
down
over
the
roof
as
he
had
come
and
sought
his
mother
who
with
the
help
of
emmaretta
and
minerva
was
washing
dishes
in
the
kitchen
my
land
she
exclaimed
as
he
came
in
what
a
time
you
been
up
there
i
never
knowed
you
to
take
half
as
long
to
dress
afore
my
fingers
are
all
thumbs
he
said
a
hot
flush
overspreading
his
sunburnt
face
i
ca
tie
this
decent
nohow
at
all
well
just
wait
till
i
can
wipe
my
hands
and
i
do
it
there
that
do
the
girls
ai
agoin
to
look
partickler
hard
at
that
bit
o
black
ribbing
maybe
not
but
i
obleeged
to
you
all
the
same
for
fixin
it
right
is
it
time
to
go
in
of
course
if
you
want
to
he
passed
out
at
the
back
door
and
through
the
yard
into
the
street
he
was
bashful
and
did
not
like
to
face
such
a
bevy
of
girls
alone
at
the
thought
of
addressing
one
of
their
number
in
especial
mildred
keith
he
felt
himself
grow
hot
and
uncomfortable
he
had
been
admiring
her
from
a
distance
all
these
weeks
but
had
never
met
her
and
much
as
he
desired
an
acquaintance
his
courage
seemed
hardly
equal
to
seeking
it
now
how
rough
and
boorish
how
awkward
and
he
would
appear
to
one
so
delicate
and
refined
he
waited
about
a
little
till
joined
by
a
fellow
mechanic
nicholas
ransquattle
when
they
went
in
together
this
was
a
wiser
step
than
gotobed
knew
for
his
stalwart
figure
showed
to
good
advantage
beside
that
of
nicholas
who
was
short
and
had
scarcely
any
neck
moved
like
a
wooden
man
and
carried
his
head
thrown
back
on
his
shoulders
he
had
a
wooden
face
too
large
featured
and
stolid
in
expression
but
he
was
not
troubled
with
bashfulness
or
any
fear
that
his
society
would
be
other
than
most
acceptable
to
any
one
upon
whom
he
might
see
fit
to
bestow
it
good
evening
ladies
i
happy
to
meet
you
all
he
said
making
a
sweeping
bow
to
the
company
as
he
entered
hat
in
hand
and
i
hope
i
see
you
well
good
evening
responded
several
voices
mr
lightcap
find
yourselves
seats
and
we
give
you
employment
threading
our
needles
for
us
rhoda
jane
was
snuffing
the
candles
hastily
laying
down
her
snuffers
she
introduced
the
young
men
to
mildred
and
dexterously
managed
to
seat
ransquattle
on
the
farther
side
of
the
room
leaving
the
field
clear
for
her
brother
for
an
empty
chair
stood
invitingly
at
miss
keith
side
gotobed
took
it
and
almost
wondering
at
his
own
audacity
addressed
his
divinity
with
a
remark
upon
the
weather
that
resource
when
all
other
topics
elude
us
she
answered
with
gracious
sweetness
yes
it
has
been
a
lovely
day
mr
lightcap
what
should
he
say
next
i
i
guess
you
never
sewed
carpet
rags
afore
is
it
my
awkwardness
at
the
business
that
makes
you
think
so
she
returned
with
a
quizzical
look
and
smile
as
she
lifted
her
fine
eyes
to
his
face
no
no
no
sirree
i
mean
he
stammered
growing
red
and
hot
you
do
it
beautiful
let
me
give
you
some
work
she
said
taking
pity
on
his
embarrassment
will
you
thread
this
needle
for
me
and
then
mine
please
put
in
claudina
who
was
again
seated
near
her
friend
then
to
his
further
relief
she
launched
out
into
a
reminiscence
of
a
candy
pulling
they
had
both
attended
the
year
before
others
of
the
boys
came
flocking
in
the
work
was
speedily
finished
there
was
some
tossing
back
and
forth
of
the
balls
amid
rather
uproarious
laughter
but
some
of
them
unwound
and
became
entangled
and
so
that
sport
was
given
up
the
girls
washed
their
hands
as
before
supper
blindman
buff
puss
in
the
corner
and
other
games
were
played
with
as
much
zest
as
if
the
players
had
been
a
parcel
of
children
then
refreshments
followed
served
up
in
the
kitchen
huckleberries
with
cream
and
sugar
watermelons
and
muskmelons
doughnuts
and
cup
cake
at
eleven
the
party
broke
up
and
the
young
men
saw
the
girls
safely
home
gotobed
being
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
the
privilege
of
waiting
upon
mildred
to
her
father
door
she
would
perhaps
have
slightly
preferred
the
attentions
of
yorke
mocker
or
wallace
ormsby
both
of
whom
she
had
met
before
and
who
were
young
men
of
much
better
education
and
much
more
polish
and
refinement
than
poor
gotobed
it
was
keith
who
admitted
her
daughter
every
one
else
in
the
house
having
retired
had
you
a
pleasant
time
she
asked
with
a
motherly
smile
i
heard
some
of
the
others
as
they
went
away
saying
it
had
been
perfectly
splendid
mildred
answered
with
an
amused
little
laugh
but
the
fun
was
of
rather
too
rough
a
sort
for
me
games
yes
and
i
took
part
until
they
began
kissing
when
i
retired
to
the
ranks
of
the
spectators
that
was
right
keith
said
emphatically
and
what
do
you
think
mother
laughed
mildred
viny
apple
was
one
of
the
guests
the
idea
of
being
invited
out
to
meet
your
housemaid
and
cook
is
it
too
funny
well
dear
let
us
be
thankful
that
celestine
ann
was
not
invited
also
leaving
me
to
get
tea

the

perusing
this
epistle
believ

had
brought
her
to
his

and
read
it
like
a
jocund
lover
with
great
applause
t
himself
twice
over
butler
hudibras
rhoda
jane
had
set
the
ball
in
motion
and
for
several
weeks
similar
festivities
were
much
in
vogue
among
the
young
people
of
pleasant
plains
there
were
other
rag
carpet
bees
some
quilting
berrying
and
nutting
parties
boatings
on
the
river
buggy
rides
and
rides
on
horseback
then
as
the
days
grew
short
and
the
evenings
long
a
singing
school
was
started
it
met
once
a
week
at
damaris
drybread
schoolroom
was
largely
attended
by
the
youth
of
both
sexes
quite
as
much
for
the
sport
to
be
got
out
of
it
as
for
the
improvement
of
their
vocal
powers
each
carried
thither
a
note
book
and
a
tallow
candle
and
at
the
end
of
the
term
paid
his
or
her
proportion
of
the
salary
of
the
teacher
one
timothy
buzzard
from
a
neighboring
town
not
the
fittest
name
in
the
world
for
a
singing
teacher
people
said
but
then
he
could
help
that
and
soon
proved
himself
competent
for
what
he
had
undertaken
for
imparting
instruction
at
least
as
to
keeping
order
among
his
pupils
some
of
whom
were
years
older
than
himself
that
he
found
was
quite
another
thing
of
course
there
was
often
a
good
deal
of
misbehavior
on
the
part
of
silly
giggling
girls
and
tittering
lads
which
tried
his
patience
occasionally
even
beyond
endurance
mildred
claudina
and
their
friend
lucilla
grange
were
not
of
these
but
invariably
conducted
themselves
in
a
ladylike
manner
which
won
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
the
sometimes
sorely
tried
teacher
and
gave
him
a
powerful
motive
to
in
the
natural
desire
to
win
their
respect
and
esteem
these
three
girls
were
the
belles
of
the
town
timothy
was
an
unmarried
man
and
when
he
seemed
to
pay
court
in
a
manner
to
one
or
another
of
them
several
of
the
young
men
were
inclined
to
grow
wrathy
over
it
and
to
feel
that
their
rights
were
invaded
will
chetwood
yorke
mocker
and
wallace
ormsby
had
become
frequent
visitors
at
keith
though
perhaps
not
more
so
in
the
case
of
the
latter
two
than
at
the
homes
of
mildred
two
intimate
girl
friends
the
six
formed
a
coterie
of
their
own
and
were
generally
seen
together
at
the
pairing
off
now
in
one
way
now
in
another
gotobed
lightcap
would
now
and
then
pluck
up
courage
to
step
in
upon
mildred
of
an
evening
and
was
invariably
treated
politely
and
kindly
though
not
in
a
way
to
give
undue
encouragement
he
had
an
instinctive
understanding
of
that
attributed
it
in
a
great
measure
to
his
own
awkward
ungainly
ways
and
looked
with
envy
upon
those
whose
better
education
and
more
polished
manners
made
them
more
acceptable
companions
nicholas
ransquattle
was
not
one
of
that
number
yet
esteemed
himself
such
and
annoyed
our
heroine
not
a
little
by
his
unwelcome
attentions
they
were
declined
whenever
it
could
be
done
without
positive
rudeness
but
vanity
and
are
often
very
blind
nicholas
was
quite
a
reader
for
a
man
of
his
station
and
limited
opportunities
his
family
were
proud
of
his
attainments
he
even
more
so
he
was
given
to
displaying
them
on
all
possible
occasions
often
wasting
a
great
deal
of
breath
in
the
charitable
effort
to
enlighten
the
ignorance
of
his
whilom
associates
he
would
call
at
keith
early
in
the
evening
and
if
occasion
offered
talk
to
mildred
by
the
hour
of
his
abstruse
studies
and
the
lighter
literature
with
which
he
found
it
necessary
to
unbend
his
mind
from
them
till
she
voted
him
an
intolerable
bore
and
he
became
the
laughing
stock
of
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
who
found
his
clumsy
lumbering
movements
and
egotistical
discourse
so
that
they
learned
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
him
and
to
find
excuses
for
remaining
in
the
room
while
he
staid
in
which
last
endeavor
they
received
every
encouragement
from
mildred
meanwhile
so
blinded
by
egotism
was
the
man
that
he
supposed
himself
an
object
of
great
admiration
to
them
and
had
little
if
any
doubt
that
the
whole
family
were
ready
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
whenever
he
should
make
formal
proposals
for
mildred
hand
he
was
a
shoemaker
by
trade
had
a
little
shop
in
the
principal
business
street
of
the
town
just
opposite
the
store
of
chetwood
and
mocker
claudina
brother
and
cousin
keith
had
opened
an
office
next
door
to
them
and
wallace
ormsby
was
diligently
studying
law
with
him
nicholas
with
a
soul
above
his
last
sometimes
envied
wallace
the
prospective
distinction
of
being
a
member
of
one
of
the
learned
professions
and
while
busied
with
his
waxed
ends
and
awl
considered
the
propriety
of
offering
himself
to
keith
as
a
student
and
both
in
one
he
finally
decided
that
the
proposal
to
mildred
should
be
made
first
the
other
to
follow
immediately
upon
her
joyful
acceptance
winter
had
come
in
earnest
the
ground
had
frozen
hard
and
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
upon
this
good
foundation
had
made
excellent
sleighing
the
young
folk
were
jubilant
over
it
and
more
than
one
plan
for
its
enjoyment
had
been
set
afloat

putting
down
his
last
and
taking
up
his
measures
let
me
have
as
soon
as
you
can
said
gotobed
and
be
sure
to
make
a
neat
fit
he
added
laughing
else
they
maybe
be
throwed
back
on
your
hands
they
give
satisfaction
you
may
depend
returned
ransquattle
straightening
himself
and
throwing
his
head
back
on
his
shoulders
in
his
accustomed
fashion
whatever
i
undertake
is
always
done
in
the
best
style
eh
i
had
noticed
that
said
gotobed
innocently
you
goin
to
the
sleighin
night
i
yes
and
i
calculate
to
take
mildred
keith
you
do
lightcap
ejaculated
in
tones
of
mingled
anger
and
inquiry
his
brows
knitting
wrathfully
a
hot
flush
dyeing
his
swarthy
cheek
have
you
asked
her
got
her
consent
her
what
her
may
i
ask
queried
yorke
mocker
coming
in
as
question
was
propounded
wallace
ormsby
close
at
his
heels
no
i
have
asked
her
yet
but
i
shall
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
now
i
warn
you
fellows
that
she
my
choice
and
you
may
each
pick
out
some
other
girl
to
take
to
the
sleighing
indeed
and
may
i
ask
how
you
came
by
the
right
to
the
first
pick
i
as
much
right
to
mildred
keith
as
anybody
else
mocker
more
i
should
say
for
i
going
to
marry
her
there
was
a
simultaneous
explosion
of
astonishment
and
indignation
at
his
presumption
from
mocker
and
ormsby
while
lightcap
thinking
no
one
would
dare
speak
with
such
confident
boasting
who
had
not
received
great
encouragement
turned
pale
then
flushed
again
as
he
picked
up
and
drew
on
the
boot
he
had
just
taken
off
i
admire
the
modesty
of
the
man
remarked
ormsby
with
cutting
sarcasm
i
presume
you
will
find
the
young
lady
ready
to
drop
into
your
arms
at
the
first
hint
of
your
intentions
of
course
since
it
must
be
evident
to
her
that
she
could
possibly
do
any
better
sneered
yorke
pray
when
did
you
learn
that
you
were
such
a
favorite
i
flatter
myself
that
i
do
not
lack
discernment
returned
ransquattle
with
unmoved
as
he
entered
his
measurements
in
his
book
then
used
his
as
a
anything
i
can
do
for
you
this
morning
gentlemen
no
growled
ormsby
but
there
something
i
can
do
for
you
namely
save
you
the
trouble
of
asking
miss
keith
to
go
with
you
night
by
informing
you
that
she
has
already
consented
to
allow
me
to
be
her
escort
is
that
so
exclaimed
ransquattle
reddening
with
anger
and
disappointment
well
i
must
say
i
think
it
very
unfair
the
way
you
fellows
always
get
ahead
of
the
rest
of
us
so
do
i
said
gotobed
leaving
the
shop
and
walking
away
in
moody
discontent
too
much
chagrined
at
learning
that
he
had
no
chance
to
enjoy
the
discomfiture
of
nicholas
there
has
been
no
unfair
dealing
about
it
retorted
ormsby
shortly
as
he
and
mocker
followed
gotobed
into
the
street
in
their
anger
and
excitement
quite
forgetting
the
errand
that
had
brought
them
to
ransquattle
shop
to
borrow
his
horse
and
sleigh
for
the
proposed
expedition
in
case
he
were
not
going
to
make
use
of
them
himself
they
crossed
the
street
joined
will
chetwood
in
the
store
and
roused
his
ire
also
by
a
recital
of
what
had
just
occurred
ransquattle
was
angry
too
no
unfair
dealing
about
it
eh
he
muttered
looking
after
them
well
i
say
there
has
been
managed
to
keep
other
fellows
at
a
distance
from
the
girl
without
any
regard
to
her
wishes
but
i
soon
put
a
stop
to
that
game
my
lads
see
if
i
do
he
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
unfolded
it
handling
it
tenderly
and
glanced
over
the
contents
with
a
smile
of
ah
ha
we
see
if
she
be
able
to
resist
this
he
said
half
aloud
as
he
refolded
and
returned
it
to
its
place
in
the
of
his
coat
a
sleigh
was
at
that
moment
standing
at
the
front
door
of
the
yellow
house
on
the
corner
and
into
it
keith
was
assisting
his
wife
and
aunt
then
followed
the
babe
and
the
three
next
in
age
they
were
going
to
the
country
to
spend
the
day
with
their
lansdale
acquaintances
the
wards
mildred
rupert
zillah
and
ada
stood
in
the
doorway
to
see
them
off
you
wo
be
back
to
tea
mildred
said
inquiringly
no
but
by
bedtime
her
father
answered
as
he
turned
the
heads
now
go
in
all
of
you
out
of
the
cold
before
you
catch
the
ague
what
did
claudina
say
asked
mildred
addressing
rupert
as
they
obeyed
the
order
yes
of
course
is
she
always
glad
of
a
chance
to
come
here
that
good
how
soon
in
about
half
an
hour
i
believe
she
said
so
you
better
hear
lessons
and
have
them
out
of
the
way
it
was
some
weeks
now
since
ada
heart
had
been
rejoiced
by
a
final
deliverance
from
miss
drybread
control
and
a
return
to
the
instruction
of
her
sister
lord
still
kept
up
his
class
and
mildred
zeal
for
study
had
not
abated
but
the
minister
had
a
funeral
to
attend
at
a
distant
point
that
afternoon
so
there
would
be
no
recitations
to
interfere
with
the
pleasure
of
a
day
with
claudina
celestia
ann
still
kept
her
position
in
the
family
and
though
only
ten
the
house
was
in
order
and
dinner
and
tea
would
require
no
supervision
by
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
house
claudina
brought
her
sewing
and
the
two
passed
an
uneventful
but
pleasant
day
together
chatting
over
their
work
or
reading
aloud
in
turn
for
claudina
was
nearly
as
great
a
lover
of
books
as
was
mildred
their
talk
was
not
largely
of
their
neighbors
but
some
jests
passed
between
them
at
ransquattle
expense
they
were
quite
severe
in
their
criticisms
as
young
things
are
too
apt
to
be
but
if
the
ears
of
the
victim
burned
it
was
not
enough
to
prevent
the
act
of
folly
he
had
in
contemplation
tea
was
over
miss
hunsinger
had
removed
the
dishes
to
the
kitchen
mildred
spread
a
bright
colored
cover
over
the
table
placed
the
candles
on
it
and
she
and
claudina
settled
themselves
to
their
sewing
again
zillah
and
ada
were
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
room
rupert
having
gone
out
presently
there
came
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
i
go
said
ada
running
to
open
it
a
man
nicholas
ransquattle
stood
on
the
threshold
stepping
past
the
child
without
speaking
he
made
directly
for
mildred
and
silently
extended
his
right
hand
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
which
he
held
a
letter
in
a
sort
of
maze
the
girl
took
it
and
with
one
of
his
profound
obeisances
of
one
of
which
cyril
had
remarked
i
thought
he
was
going
to
squattle
on
the
stove
when
he
put
his
head
down
so
low
he
withdrew
without
having
spoken
a
word
they
could
hear
the
crackling
of
the
snow
under
his
heavy
tread
as
he
walked
away
o
milly
what
is
it
what
is
it
what
did
he
bring
it
for
had
he
been
to
the
the
little
girls
were
asking
with
eager
curiosity
mildred
turned
to
claudina
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
for
a
moment
then
burst
into
a
simultaneous
hearty
laugh
did
ever
you
see
such
a
comical
performance
never
it
addressed
to
you
of
course
yes
seizing
a
candle
laughing
and
blushing
come
help
me
to
read
it
mildred
said
we
go
up
stairs
where
we
wo
be
disturbed
may
we
go
too
may
we
know
what
your
letter
about
pleaded
the
little
girls
as
the
older
ones
were
hurrying
away
no
no
tis
the
sort
for
children
like
you
to
know
about
laughed
the
sister
be
good
and
stay
here
we
wo
be
gone
long
and
some
day
perhaps
i
tell
you
what
it
says
they
hurried
through
the
kitchen
where
miss
hunsinger
was
vigorously
setting
things
to
rights
up
the
crooked
stairway
and
on
into
aunt
wealthy
room
fastened
the
door
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
missive
it
was
an
offer
to
miss
mildred
keith
of
the
heart
hand
and
fortune
of
the
writer
nicholas
ransquattle
who
denominated
himself
her
devoted
worshiper
and
slave
and
addressed
her
as
an
angel
and
the
loveliest
and
sweetest
of
created
beings
the
girls
giggled
over
it
at
first
but
at
length
mildred
threw
it
down
in
supreme
disgust
such
stuff
and
nonsense
it
perfectly
sickening
i
anything
but
an
angel
especially
when
i
lose
my
temper
and
i
believe
i
losing
it
now
for
i
feel
insulted
by
an
offer
from
such
a
conceited
booby
somebody
coming
exclaimed
claudina
yes
rupert
i
know
his
step
well
ru
what
is
it
as
the
boy
rapped
lightly
on
the
door
why
before
you
answer
that
letter
and
accept
the
fellow
let
me
tell
you
something
mildred
threw
open
the
door
who
told
you
i
had
one
the
children
told
me
about
old
nick
bringing
you
a
letter
he
answered
laughing
but
looking
angry
too
and
it
easy
enough
to
guess
the
subject
particularly
since
i
heard
a
bit
of
news
over
yonder
at
the
smithy
gote
lightcap
says
he
heard
him
old
nick
boasting
this
morning
before
several
young
men
that
he
was
going
to
marry
mildred
keith
for
a
minute
or
more
mildred
did
not
speak
she
had
probably
never
felt
so
angry
in
all
her
life
the
conceited
puppy
she
cried
at
last
would
i
like
to
take
some
of
it
out
of
him
good
for
you
cried
rupert
clapping
his
hands
i
knew
you
be
mad
and
would
i
like
to
horsewhip
him
for
his
impudence
but
it
is
right
said
mildred
already
cooling
down
a
little
and
ashamed
of
her
outburst
you
could
thrash
him
ru
but
instead
you
shall
if
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
carrying
him
my
answer
tell
me
what
it
is
first
mildred
took
the
letter
and
wrote
in
pencil
beneath
the
signature
the
above
offer
is
positively
declined
all
future
visits
on
the
part
of
the
writer
also
and
signed
her
name
there
return
it
she
said
with
the
information
that
it
is
my
final
reply
illustration
chapter
sixteenth
oh
jealousy
thou
bane
of
pleasing
friendship
thou
worst
invader
of
our
tender
bosoms
how
does
thy
rancour
poison
all
our
softness
and
turn
our
gentle
natures
into
bitterness
rowe
the
news
was
too
good
to
keep
and
rupert
could
not
forbear
stopping
at
the
smithy
on
his
return
and
giving
gotobed
a
hint
of
how
matters
stood
to
say
that
the
certainty
of
a
decided
rejection
of
ransquattle
suit
lifted
a
burden
of
anxiety
from
young
lightcap
mind
is
not
an
of
the
relief
the
boy
communication
afforded
him
he
had
been
moody
and
depressed
since
his
visit
of
the
morning
to
ransquattle
shop
and
had
refused
to
give
rhoda
jane
any
satisfaction
as
to
his
intentions
in
regard
to
making
one
of
the
sleighing
party
of
the
following
evening
she
was
therefore
agreeably
surprised
when
toward
he
came
in
quite
a
merry
mood
into
the
kitchen
where
she
sat
sewing
alone
their
mother
having
stepped
out
to
see
a
neighbor
to
tell
her
that
he
had
decided
to
go
well
i
glad
of
it
she
said
and
who
are
you
going
to
take
he
colored
at
the
question
and
answered
almost
doggedly
i
going
after
sarah
miller
why
do
you
ask
mildred
keith
there
ai
no
use
ormsby
headed
me
off
there
yes
an
if
you
do
look
out
with
yer
pokin
ways
he
head
you
off
altogether
and
marry
her
afore
you
know
it
she
ai
goin
off
in
such
a
hurry
he
muttered
drumming
on
the
table
with
his
fingers
then
jumping
up
from
his
chair
and
going
over
to
the
stove
making
a
pretense
of
warming
himself
that
he
might
avoid
the
keen
scrutiny
of
his
sister
sharp
eyes
but
what
the
use
o
me
a
tryin
with
all
them
fellers
round
gote
lightcap
i
ashamed
of
you
exclaimed
rhoda
jane
if
i
was
a
man
i
have
more
pluck
by
a
long
shot
be
me
that
would
let
any
feller
get
ahead
where
i
was
amind
to
go
in
and
win
you
do
know
nothin
about
it
he
retorted
lighting
a
candle
and
stalking
off
to
bed
dear
me
if
he
only
had
half
my
spunk
said
rhoda
jane
looking
after
him
with
scornful
eyes
and
a
curling
lip
the
wish
was
echoed
more
than
once
in
his
heart
as
he
lay
awake
far
into
the
night
revolving
the
subject
in
his
mind
and
filled
with
longings
doubts
and
fears
he
had
been
so
greatly
rejoiced
over
the
downfall
of
hopes
yet
after
all
what
did
it
avail
him
while
the
other
three
whose
superiority
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
to
himself
remained
in
the
way
alas
there
was
no
great
cause
for
exultation
that
one
rival
out
of
four
had
been
removed
from
his
path
still
was
it
quite
certain
that
they
were
all
rivals
might
it
not
be
that
miss
chetwood
or
miss
grange
was
the
more
attractive
girl
to
one
or
all
of
them
the
six
were
so
constantly
seen
together
the
attentions
of
the
three
young
men
were
so
equally
divided
between
the
three
girls
that
who
could
tell
how
they
were
going
to
pair
off
if
at
all
besides
there
was
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
a
lady
did
always
select
that
one
from
among
her
admirers
whom
other
people
in
general
considered
the
most
desirable
match
there
was
yet
a
spark
of
hope
for
him
but
ah
if
he
only
had
rhoda
jane
pluck
and
energy
of
determination
near
sunset
of
the
next
day
a
large
omnibus
sleigh
drawn
by
four
horses
with
jingling
bells
and
well
supplied
with
buffalo
robes
and
other
appliances
for
keeping
the
cold
at
bay
went
from
house
to
house
in
pleasant
plains
picking
up
the
girls
and
boys
to
the
number
of
a
dozen
or
more
a
very
merry
company
then
glided
swiftly
on
over
the
snow
for
some
six
or
eight
miles
the
sleighing
was
fine
the
weather
not
severe
the
moon
rose
soon
after
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
the
girls
being
well
muffled
up
in
hoods
cloaks
and
other
wraps
were
warm
and
cosy
and
vastly
enjoyed
the
ride
of
course
the
lads
did
the
same
they
laughed
jested
and
sang
and
found
time
fly
as
swiftly
as
the
horses
who
seemed
to
make
nothing
of
their
load
the
destination
of
the
party
was
a
hotel
in
a
neighboring
village
where
a
supper
had
been
ordered
for
them
some
days
before
it
was
served
up
hot
and
savory
shortly
after
their
arrival
a
couple
of
hours
were
afterward
spent
in
the
parlor
of
the
hotel
in
social
chat
and
playing
games
and
here
they
were
joined
by
timothy
buzzard
who
taught
a
singing
school
in
this
town
also
there
another
rival
thought
gotobed
jealously
watching
him
carrying
on
a
lively
conversation
with
mildred
like
every
body
after
her
and
i
ca
get
no
chance
at
all
rhoda
jane
was
equally
jealous
partly
for
her
brother
but
still
more
for
herself
because
last
year
buzzard
had
waited
upon
her
more
than
on
any
other
girl
in
pleasant
plains
and
she
considered
him
her
property
and
did
fancy
bein
cut
out
by
no
newcomer
nor
by
anybody
else
for
that
matter
influenced
by
the
desire
to
separate
the
two
she
was
the
first
to
suggest
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
home
she
was
agreeably
surprised
that
mildred
promptly
seconded
the
motion
some
objected
saying
there
was
no
hurry
but
as
it
was
now
eleven
these
were
overruled
by
the
majority
and
the
sleigh
was
presently
announced
as
in
readiness
ca
we
make
room
for
another
passenger
some
one
asked
as
amid
laughter
and
jesting
they
were
crowding
into
the
vehicle
who
is
it

and

said
taking
the
offered

with
a
laugh
at
his
own
stale
jest
now
we
got
the
singing
master
along

rhoda

when

buzzard
remarked
ormsby
i
hope

willing
to
do
that
he
responded
miss
lightcap
what
shall
i
sing
highly
pleased
that
the
choice
was
given
her
rhoda
jane
promptly
named
a
love
song
she
had
heard
him
sing
as
a
solo
he
gave
it
then
another
selected
by
miss
miller
then
turning
to
mildred
i
think
it
is
your
turn
now
miss
keith
he
said
she
proposed
a
round
he
had
taught
them
that
winter
saying
all
could
join
in
it
all
did
so
with
right
good
will
other
rounds
glees
choruses
and
solos
followed
they
sang
on
even
after
reaching
pleasant
plains
sang
on
till
but
two
or
three
were
left
as
one
after
another
was
set
down
at
his
or
her
own
door
a
light
burned
in
the
parlor
at
keith
and
the
front
door
was
opened
before
the
sleigh
had
quite
drawn
up
to
it
poor
dear
mother
what
a
shame
to
have
kept
you
up
so
long
mildred
exclaimed
as
she
came
in
never
mind
was
the
cheerful
reply
here
a
good
warm
fire
take
this
close
to
it
and
do
remove
any
of
your
wraps
till
you
cease
to
feel
chilly
i
should
have
prepared
you
some
hot
lemonade
but
for
one
little
difficulty
in
the
way
no
lemons
to
be
had
coffee
would
keep
you
awake
but
you
shall
have
a
glass
of
good
rich
milk
either
hot
or
cold
as
you
prefer
now
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
time
you
had
i
wish
every
girl
had
such
a
mother
as
mine
mildred
said
smiling
fondly
up
into
the
face
she
loved
so
well
i
verily
believe
i
take
as
much
pleasure
in
recounting
my
adventures
to
you
as
in
going
through
them
and
it
is
so
nice
to
have
so
safe
and
wise
and
loving
a
confidante
mother
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
not
so
much
about
what
has
occurred
as
of
something
that
happened
last
night
i
have
been
looking
for
an
opportunity
all
day
but
without
finding
it
for
you
know
we
were
unusually
busy
all
the
morning
and
had
company
all
the
afternoon
till
it
was
time
for
me
to
get
ready
for
the
keith
glanced
at
the
face
of
a
tall
clock
ticking
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
want
very
much
to
hear
your
story
daughter
but
if
you
can
sleep
without
having
told
it
i
think
we
will
reserve
it
till
for
see
it
is
now
twelve
the
girl
would
have
been
glad
to
unburden
her
mind
and
to
learn
if
her
mother
approved
not
her
rejection
of
ransquattle
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
her
manner
of
doing
it
but
that
dear
mother
face
cheerful
though
it
was
told
of
physical
exhaustion
and
need
of
sleep
mildred
rose
hastily
high
time
then
that
we
wore
both
in
bed
my
story
will
keep
perfectly
well
till
sit
down
and
finish
warming
yourself
keith
said
with
a
smile
i
want
to
hear
about
we
will
keep
the
longer
story
for
the
lightcaps
found
their
house
all
dark
the
family
had
retired
to
bed
hours
ago
but
leaving
the
kitchen
door
unlocked
and
a
good
fire
in
the
stove
good
and
warm
in
here
remarked
gotobed
feeling
for
the
candle
and
matches
his
mother
was
sure
to
have
left
on
the
table
ready
for
them
yes
feels
comfortable
i
shall
set
down
and
warm
a
bit
i
crawl
up
to
that
there
cold
me
too
do
expect
to
sleep
none
when
i
do
get
to
bed
growled
gote
as
he
succeeded
in
lighting
the
candle
after
two
or
three
ineffectual
attempts
and
set
it
on
the
table
again
kind
o
eggzited
are
ye
some
i
say
what
did
you
make
room
for
that
do
swear
she
sneered
as
he
paused
for
a
suitable
cognomen
to
bestow
upon
buzzard
i
agoin
to
he
said
angrily
not
but
what
i
sufficient
cause
in
your
letting
that
unclean
bird
in
amongst
us
decent
folks
there
now
that
do
fur
she
snapped
tim
buzzard
no
more
an
unclean
bird
than
you
are
he
twicet
as
good
lookin
and
sings
like
a
nightingale
but
now
see
here
do
let
quarrel
but
go
to
work
together
to
bring
things
round
right
you
do
want
him
to
cut
you
out
with
mildred
keith
and
i
do
want
her
to
cut
me
out
with
him
so
now
you
just
spunk
up
and
pop
the
question
right
off
if
you
do
one
or
other
them
fellers
get
ahead
o
you
you
may
just
take
my
word
for
that
gotobed
dropped
his
head
into
his
hands
and
sighed
deeply
then
rose
and
walked
the
floor
rhoda
jane
watched
him
with
an
eager
look
well
he
said
at
length
i
wisht
i
knowed
how
knowed
how
you
need
make
many
words
about
it
like
up
a
sermon
or
a
president
message
it
a
heap
more
important
the
happiness
of
a
feller
whole
life
a
dependin
onto
it
silence
for
some
minutes
rhoda
jane
sitting
meditatively
before
the
stove
her
feet
on
its
hearth
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
while
her
brother
continued
his
restless
walk
she
was
the
first
to
speak
i
write
it
out
if
i
was
you
i
ai
used
to
writin
much
well
you
can
get
used
to
it
you
can
try
and
try
till
you
writ
somethin
that
do
i
could
write
anything
good
enough
for
her
to
see
then
take
way
i
do
never
git
no
chance
and
if
i
did
i
be
sure
as
the
world
then
you
have
to
write
it
and
i
help
you
concluded
rhoda
jane
with
energy
she
arose
as
she
spoke
picked
up
the
candle
stepped
quickly
to
a
corner
shelf
in
the
next
room
whence
she
brought
an
inkstand
and
a
quill
pen
setting
these
down
on
the
kitchen
table
she
went
back
and
opening
a
bureau
drawer
where
miscellaneous
articles
were
kept
fished
out
from
its
depths
a
sheet
of
foolscap
which
she
spread
out
beside
the
inkstand
that
ai
nice
enough
said
gotobed
eyeing
it
disapprovingly
make
it
up
on
that
and
get
better
at
the
store
to
copy
it
onto
returned
his
sister
now
you
set
down
and
go
at
it
like
a
man
or
maybe
i
better
say
like
a
woman
she
added
sarcastically
if
i
only
had
an
edication
groaned
gotobed
taking
up
the
pen
but
it
mighty
hard
on
a
feller
such
things
as
this
is
when
he
has
well
do
the
best
you
kin
and
mebbe
it
come
out
right
for
all
you
and
got
a
good
trade
and
can
make
a
good
livin
for
her
just
tell
her
that
and
tell
her
you
think
she
as
purty
as
a
picter
and
and
knows
a
lot
and
that
you
worship
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
wo
never
let
the
wind
blow
rough
on
her
wo
never
say
no
cross
words
to
her
and
and
a
lot
more
o
such
stuff
that
what
girls
like
well
i
you
ought
to
know
seeing
you
belong
to
the
sect
but
it
a
heap
easier
for
you
to
say
it
than
for
me
to
git
it
writ
down
in
black
and
white
he
sighed
i
declare
i
clear
beat
out
with
you
said
rhoda
jane
snuffing
the
candle
impatiently
and
i
a
great
mind
to
leave
you
to
make
it
up
by
yourself
but
she
went
on
coaxing
suggesting
and
prompting
till
between
them
they
had
composed
an
epistle
which
was
satisfactory
to
her
though
not
to
her
brother
it
nigh
onto
three
and
i
awful
tired
and
sleepy
she
remarked
as
at
last
they
separated
and
sought
their
beds
the
next
day
gotobed
searched
the
town
for
letter
paper
and
bought
half
a
quire
of
the
best
he
could
find
during
the
next
week
all
his
leisure
moments
were
spent
in
making
revised
and
improved
copies
of
his
and
rhoda
jane
joint
composition
he
had
used
his
last
sheet
and
seized
with
a
fit
of
desperation
he
selected
the
one
which
seemed
to
him
the
least
faulty
and
sent
it
by
his
sister
keith
opening
the
door
in
answer
to
rhoda
jane
knock
was
struck
with
the
peculiar
expression
of
the
girl
face
a
mixture
of
pride
condescension
and
exultation
good
evenin
mis
keith
where
mildred
she
said
stepping
in
and
glancing
about
the
room
with
an
air
of
importance
i
want
to
see
her
pertickler
got
somethin
fur
her
and
a
conscious
glance
at
the
missive
in
her
hand
enlightened
the
lady
as
to
its
nature
mildred
is
not
at
home
she
said
will
not
be
until
bedtime
but
anything
you
choose
to
leave
with
me
will
be
given
her
on
her
return
rhoda
jane
considered
a
moment
she
felt
a
strong
desire
to
deliver
the
note
into
mildred
own
hand
and
to
watch
her
while
reading
it
but
should
she
carry
it
back
gote
might
change
his
mind
and
put
off
indefinitely
this
business
which
she
was
so
desirous
to
have
carried
through
at
once
she
left
it
though
with
evident
reluctance
she
presently
congratulated
herself
that
she
had
done
so
gotobed
eagerly
awaiting
her
return
peering
anxiously
every
other
minute
through
the
smithy
door
hailed
her
in
breathless
excitement
well
what
what
did
she
she
was
there
she
gone
out
somewheres
and
wo
be
back
till
bedtime
give
it
to
me
then
quick
and
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
peremptory
gesture
i
ai
got
it
rhoda
jane
answered
with
a
sardonic
grin
where
is
it
you
ai
gone
and
left
it
he
cried
aghast
yes
i
have
i
give
it
to
mis
keith
gotobed
groaned
i
thought
better
of
it
i
throw
it
in
the
fire
this
minute
if
i
had
it
here
she
think
me
a
fool
i
know
she
will
if
she
does
she
one
returned
rhoda
jane
shortly
and
left
him
to
his
unavailing
regrets
how
they
tortured
him
how
could
he
bear
the
suspense
mildred
was
merciful
and
did
not
keep
him
in
doubt
any
longer
than
necessary
he
found
a
letter
next
morning
in
the
with
his
address
upon
it
written
in
a
lady
delicate
graceful
hand
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
into
his
mouth
at
the
sight
he
almost
snatched
it
from
the
postmaster
hand
and
without
stopping
to
answer
the
jesting
remark
of
that
functionary
on
his
sudden
accession
of
color
hurried
away
never
stopping
till
he
reached
the
privacy
of
his
own
room
thankful
that
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
without
being
seen
by
any
of
the
family
but
now
it
was
a
full
minute
ere
he
could
summon
courage
to
open
the
missive
and
learn
his
fate
and
even
when
it
lay
open
before
him
he
passed
his
hand
several
times
across
his
eyes
as
if
to
clear
his
sight
yet
it
was
very
plainly
written
also
plainly
expressed
a
distinct
decided
though
very
kindly
rejection
of
his
suit
the
only
reason
given
that
she
could
not
love
him
and
a
loveless
marriage
could
be
fruitful
of
nothing
but
misery
to
both
parties

baylie

lightcap
you
the
biggest
fool
that
ever

exclaimed
the
young
blacksmith
between
his
clenched
teeth
throwing
mildred
dainty
note
upon
the
floor
and
grinding
it
with
his
heel
while
the
hot
blood
surged
over
his
swarthy
face
which
expressed
in
every
lineament
intense
mortification
and
chagrin
you
might
knowed
the
likes
o
her
could
never
fancy
sech
a
ungainly
know
varmint
as
you
be
he
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
for
a
moment
groaning
in
spirit
for
the
wound
in
his
heart
was
deep
as
well
as
that
to
his
pride
it
does
seem
as
if
there
war
nothin
left
in

he
sighed
but
then
i
not
the
feller
to
give
up
and
die
fight
it
out
an
get
over
it
yet
he
picked
up
the
letter
and
thrust
it
into
his
bosom
straightened
himself
went
down
into
the
smithy
and
fell
to
work
at
his
anvil
dealing
vigorous
blows
as
if
thus
he
would
drive
away
the
demon
of
despair
he
ate
little
at
dinner
and
conscious
that
rhoda
jane
sharp
eyes
were
upon
him
scarcely
lifted
his
from
his
plate
he
hurried
back
to
his
work
she
followed
him
the
next
minute
so
she
give
you
the
mitten
who
told
you
so
he
asked
defiantly
standing
before

with
arms
folded
and
head
erect
but
reddening
to
his
very

humph
i
ai

and
anybody

he
concluded
moodily
picking
up
his
hammer
how
he
take
his
mitten
laughed
rhoda

i
ha
liked
to
seen

the
building
lot
selected
by
the
keiths
was
bought
and
fenced
in
almost
immediately
and
men
set
to
work
at
digging
the
cellar
and
then
putting
up
the
walls
of
the
new
house
by
dint
of
energetic
oversight
and
urging
on
of
the
workmen
keith
succeeded
in
having
it
roofed
in
before
the
first
heavy
fall
of
snow
so
that
some
advance
could
be
made
with
the
laying
of
floors
lathing
during
the
winter
when
spring
came
things
took
a
fresh
start
more
men
were
employed
and
every
effort
put
forth
by
the
owner
to
have
the
building
hurried
on
to
completion
each
member
of
the
family
was
deeply
interested
the
children
made
daily
journeys
to
the
spot
and
all
rupert
leisure
time
was
devoted
to
digging
planting
and
other
improvements
of
the
grounds
the
boy
was
full
of
energy
and
fond
of
life
in
the
open
air
his
garden
did
him
credit
supplying
nearly
all
the
vegetables
wanted
for
family
use
with
some
assistance
from
older
heads
and
hands
he
terraced
the
bank
overlooking
the
river
made
steps
down
to
the
water
edge
where
was
a
fine
spring
and
built
a
small
arbor
and
a
the
new
dwelling
would
be
hardly
so
large
as
the
one
they
were
to
leave
for
it
until
an
addition
should
be
built
but
of
more
sightly
appearance
and
far
more
conveniently
arranged
besides
it
was
their
own
and
who
does
not
know
the
charm
that
ownership
gives
they
were
very
impatient
to
get
into
it
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
children
when
at
last
the
announcement
was
made
that
it
was
fit
for
occupancy
it
was
their
father
who
brought
the
news
into
their
reading
and
sewing
circle
one
bright
warm
afternoon
early
in
july
when
shall
we
move
wife
he
asked
oh
please
mother
say
cried
several
little
voices
keith
laughed
it
is
no
such
quick
work
children
but
we
might
bedin
said
don
i
take
dis
tat
and
tum
back
aden
for
other
tings
hugging
up
a
large
white
and
yellow
cat
that
had
been
a
petted
member
of
the
household
for
some
months
past
h
said
cyril
toy
can
take
his
own
self
he
got
more
feet
to
run
with
than
any
of
the
rest
and
he
always
runs
alongside
wherever
we
goes
put
in
fan
mother
can
we
help
move
the
question
was
unheard
and
remained
unanswered
for
the
reason
that
the
older
people
were
talking
busily
among
themselves
i
think
we
may
begin
keith
was
saying
celestia
ann
is
through
with
her
week
washing
and
ironing
and
i
set
her

and

the
furniture
of
that
room
carried

idea
her

the
children

way
the
order
was
obeyed
somewhat
reluctantly
all
going
out
to
the
adjoining
room
zillah
and
ada
stopped
there
and
each
took
a
book
the
younger
three
went
up
stairs
let
pack
up
our
things
said
cyril
what
we
pack

queried

see
the
boys
got
out
their
stores
of
marbles
balls
bits
of
twine
a
broken
knife
or
two
a
few
fish
hooks
and
a
set
of
jackstraws
their
father
had
made
for
them
fan
brought
out
her
treasures
also
which
consisted
of
several
dolls
and
their
wardrobes
a
picture
book
and
some
badly
battered
and
bruised
dishes
the
remains
of
a
once
highly
prized
metal
toy
tea
set
a
packing
box
in
one
corner
of
the
large
second
story
room
was
where
the
playthings
of
the
little
ones
were
always
kept
when
not
in
use
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
being
one
of
the
cardinal
rules
of
the
household
can
we
take
over
there
now
asked
fan
as
she
gathered
hers
pell
mell
into
her
apron
no
of
course
not
said
cyril
did
you
hear
mother
say
we
begin
moving
till
then
what
did
we
get
out
for
to
pack
up
and
have
ready
to
take
over
in
the
morning
what
we
pack
in
reiterated
don
let
look
round
for
a
box
the
right
size
said
cyril
course
we
ca
carry
them
in
the
big
board
one
it
too
heavy
a
good
deal
of
rummaging
followed
upon
that
first
in
the
outer
room
then
in
the
other
occupied
by
aunt
wealthy
and
mildred
finally
they
came
upon
a
pasteboard
box
standing
on
mildred
writing
table
which
cyril
pronounced
just
the
thing
but
maybe
milly
wo
like
us
to
take
it
objected
fan
as
he
unceremoniously
emptied
the
contents
upon
the
table
oh
she
wo
care
there
nothing
in
it
but
old
papers
and
things
writed
all
over
she
done
with
them
and
she
be
puttin
them
in
the
fire
next
thing
you
know
she
always
likes
to
burn
up
old
rubbish
that
last
statement
was
certainly
according
to
fact
and
fan
made
no
further
objection
don
suggested
asking
leave
but
cyril
overruled
that
also
no
they
all
too
busy
down
there
we
must
bother
he
said
walking
off
with
his
prize
one
paper
had
fallen
on
the
floor
fan
stooped
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
curiously
as
the
boys
hurried
off
into
the
other
room
with
their
prize
milly
did
do
that
she
remarked
tai
pretty
writin
like
hers
guess
she
would
want
to
keep
such
an
ugly
old
thing
come
fan
cyril
called
do
you
want
to
put
your
things
in
too
yes
she
said
coming
out
with
the
letter
still
in
her
hand
fan
dolls
were
put
in
last
and
the
box
was
too
full
to
allow
the
lid
to
go
on
i
take
bertha
and
carry
her
in
my
arms
she
said
lifting
out
her
largest
and
favorite
child
i
want
her
to
play
wis
now
and
i
raser
not
trust
her
in
dere
wis
dose
marbles
and
balls
rollin
round
now
the
lid

on
all
right
said
cyril
adjusting
it
we
all
packed
up
observed
don
with
satisfaction
now
let
go
play
in
the
grove
the
others
were
agreed
and
fan
decided
that
she
must
take
with
her
two
small
rag
dolls
in
addition
to
bertha
puss
had
come
up
stairs
with
the
children
and
was
walking
round
and
round
them
as
they
sat
on
the
carpet
rubbing
affectionately
against
them
and
purring
loudly
let
give
a
ride
on
toy
back
said
cyril
here
a
string
to
tie
on
with
and
this
old
letter
shall
be
the
saddle
picking
up
the
one
fan
had
brought
from
the
other
room
and
which
she
had
laid
down
beside
the
box
the
others
were
pleased
with
the
idea
cyril
twisted
the
letter
into
some
slight
resemblance
to
a
saddle
and
in
spite
of
a
vigorous
resistance
from
the
cat
tied
it
and
the
dolls
pretty
securely
to
her
back
she
was
of
course
expected
to
go
with
or
follow
them
as
usual
but
the
instant
they
released
her
she
flew
down
the
stairs
darted
out
of
the
open
kitchen
door
tore
across
the
yard
and
scaled
the
fence
in
a
twinkling
the
children
pursued
at
their
utmost
speed
but
toy
was
out
of
sight
before
they
could
descend
the
stairs
well
i
never
that
cat
must
a
gone
mad
celestia
ann
was
saying
standing
in
the
doorway
her
hands
on
her
hips
her
gaze
turned
wonderingly
in
the
direction
toy
had
taken
where
which
way
did
she
go
asked
the
children
breathlessly
over
the
fence
yonder
tearing
like
mad
she
went
like
a
streak
lightnin
through
the
kitching
here
and
i
did
see
no
more
of
her
after
she
clum
the
fence
she
got
the
hydrophoby
bad
you
may
depend
and
i
only
hope
she
wo
bite
nobody
somebody
knocks
her
in
the
head
no
it
my
dolls
she
got
said
fan
who
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
hydrophoby
might
be
o
boys
hurry
and
catch
her
she
loses
she
called
after
her
brothers
as
they
renewed
the
pursuit
hurrying
across
the
yard
and
climbing
the
fence
with
a
speed
that
did
credit
to
their
ability
in
that
line
fan
stood
beside
it
gazing
out
anxiously
through
a
crack
between
the
high
rough
boards
till
the
boys
returned
all
breathless
with
running
to
report
no
toy
and
no
dolls
to
be
seen
anywhere
but
do
cry
added
cyril
seeing
fan
lips
tremble
ominously
she
come
back
when
she
wants
her
supper
you
bet
it
wicked
to
bet
remarked
don
virtuously
i
did
said
cyril
come
let
go
play
in
the
grove
i
bend
down
a
tree
and
give
you
a
nice
ride
fan
gotobed
lightcap
had
just
finished
a
job
and
pausing
a
moment
to
rest
was
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
a
rather
dilapidated
specimen
of
when
a
cat
darted
in
at
the
open
door
ran
round
the
smithy
in
a
frightened
way
then
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
rolled
and
squirmed
kicking
its
feet
in
the
air
in
the
evident
effort
to
rid
itself
of
something
tied
to
its
back
with
a
single
stride
gotobed
was
at
the
side
of
the
struggling
animal
he
took
it
up
and
in
a
few
seconds
had
relieved
it
of
its
hated
incumbrance
it
them
keith
children
pet

he
said
half
aloud
and
been
a

onto
it
there
you
kin
go
puss
do
take
up
yer
lodgin
here
for
we
cats
enough
o
our
own
eh
what
this
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
letter
and
he
recognized
his
own
awkward
hieroglyphics
he
felt
his
face
grow
very
red
and
hot
as
he
straightened
it
out
upon
his
knees
his
heart
fluttering
with
the
thought
of
the
possibility
that
it
might
have
been
some
little
liking
for
the
writer
that
had
prevented
its
immediate
destruction
there
were
some
words
in
pencil
along
the
margin
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
slowly
deciphered
them
he
was
not
much
accustomed
to
reading
writing
and
this
had
become
slightly
blurred
but
he
made
it
out
clearly
at
last
a
jesting
remark
about
his
mistakes
in
spelling
and
grammar
which
were
many
and
glaring
i
would
ha
believed
it
of
her
he
exclaimed
crimsoning
with
anger
and
shame
as
he
flung
the
torn
and
crumpled
sheet
into
the
fire
of
his
forge
the
dolls
after
it
he
caught
up
his
hammer
and
fell
to
work
again
muttering
to
himself
it
her
writin
there
ca
be
no
mistake
fur
it
just
like
what
she
writ
me
afore
and
i
would
a
believed
it
of
her
i
would
i
thought
she
a
kind
heart
and
would
make
allowance
fur
them
that
had
the
same
chance
as
her
he
had
not
been
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
mildred
she
would
never
have
wounded
his
feelings
intentionally
she
had
a
habit
of
writing
her
thoughts
on
the
margin
of
what
she
was
reading
and
the
words
had
been
carelessly
traced
there
with
no
expectation
that
they
would
ever
be
seen
by
any
eye
but
her
own
nor
would
they
but
for
the
mischievous
meddling
of
the
children
she
set
no
value
upon
the
letter
did
not
miss
it
till
months
afterwards
and
then
supposed
she
had
destroyed
it
though
she
could
not
distinctly
remember
having
done
so
in
the
meantime
gotobed

his
own
counsel

well
as

chapter
eighteenth
farewell
a
long
farewell
the
keiths
were
scarcely
more
than
well
settled
in
their
new
home
when
miss
stanhope
announced
her
intention
of
returning
to
ohio
almost
immediately
this
news
was
received
by
the
family
with
something
akin
to
consternation
how
could
they
do
without
her
they
asked
everybody
need
her
every
day
of
their
lives
from
father
and
mother
down
to
annis
ah
she
answered
smiling
though
her
eyes
were
dim
with
unshed
tears
you
have
each
other
and
will
soon
find
that
you
can
get
on
very
well
indeed
without
your
blundering
old
auntie
but
the
question
is
how
shall
she
do
without
you
the
old
lansdale
home
will
be
very
lonely
with
no
little
feet
about
it
then
what
makes
you
go
aunt
wealthy
chorused
the
children
clinging
to
her
with
many
a
loving
caress
i
must
my
darlings
there
business
i
have
to
attend
to
and
i
feel
that
the
ague
is
breaking
me
down
i
fear
that
is
too
true
keith
said
with
a
strong
effort
to
speak
cheerfully
and
therefore
i
will
not
entreat
you
to
stay
dear
auntie
but
rather
urge
your
departure
before
the
sickly
season
sets
in
though
it
just
breaks
my
heart
to
think
of
the
parting
she
added
hurrying
from
the
room
to
conceal
her
emotion
but
you
come
back
soon
wo
you
auntie
pleaded
the
children
not
very
i
afraid
dears
it
a
long
and
expensive
journey
too
long
for
you
to
take
alone
aunt
wealthy
mildred
said
i
dread
it
for
you
i
do
see
how
we
can
let
you
go
without
a
protector
i
shall
not
child
is
not
the
promise
to
me
i
am
with
thee
and
will
keep
thee
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest
yes
to
me
and
to
each
one
of
his
children
so
i
am
not
afraid
and
you
need
not
fear
for
me
dear
auntie
if
the
saviour
were
here
i
think
he
would
say
to
you
woman
great
is
thy
faith
my
dear
i
deserve
no
such
commendation
my
faith
is
often
very
weak
but
i
want
you
to
remember
and
try
to
realize
that
this
almighty
friend
not
only
goes
with
me
when
i
leave
you
but
stays
with
you
also
according
to
his
gracious
promise
will
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
troubles
and
trials
will
come
and
there
are
dark
and
stormy
days
in
every
life
but
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
be
i
can
not
tell
you
mildred
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
leave
you
all
she
continued
her
voice
trembling
with
emotion
but
it
would
be
ten
times
harder
were
it
not
that
i
know
god
is
our
god
forever
and
ever
and
that
will
be
our
guide
even
unto
death
aunt
wealthy
said
keith
coming
in
again
stuart
and
i
have
been
talking
this
over
this
resolve
of
yours
to
return
to
ohio
and
he
says
it
will
never
do
for
you
to
attempt
it
without
an
escort
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
an
escort
if
there
is
one
to
be
had
miss
stanhope
answered
but
if
not
i
must
even
go
without
trusting
in
providence
but
you
would
wait
a
few
weeks
rather
than
go
alone
certainly
god
works
by
means
and
we
are
to
use
them
while
at
the
same
time
we
trust
only
in
him
stuart
says
the
merchants
will
be
going
on
east
to
buy
their
fall
goods
he
will
inquire
among
them
and
let
you
know
ah
yes
i
think
i
heard
mr
what
his
name
mimicker
sneerer
mocker
suggested
mildred
with
a
smile
yes
yes
mocker
i
heard
him
say
something
about
it
being
his
turn
this
fall
to
lay
in
a
new
supply
of
goods
ah
i
hope
it
will
turn
out
that
you
will
have
him
for
your
escort
aunt
wealthy
said
mildred
for
i
know
that
he
will
take
the
best
possible
care
of
you
but
do
try
auntie
to
get
his
name
fixed
in
your
memory
that
i
will
miss
stanhope
answered
with
a
good
humored
smile
for
he
might
not
fancy
the
synonyms
of
it
the
meaning
not
being
the
most
complimentary
in
the
world
keith
brought
home
word
that
mocker
would
leave
for
the
east
in
a
fortnight
and
would
be
happy
to
take
charge
of
miss
stanhope
aunt
wealthy
had
always
been
very
dear
to
these
nieces
and
nephews
but
now
that
they
were
about
to
lose
her
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
had
never
realized
half
her
worth
they
lingered
near
her
they
hung
upon
her
words
and
looks
and
when
the
time
for
parting
came
clung
about
her
with
sobs
and
tears
loading
her
with
caresses
till
she
was
forced
to
tear
herself
from
their
embraces
and
hurry
away
the
stage
had
drawn
up
before
the
gate
she
hastened
down
the
garden
path
the
weeping
children
running
after
keith
and
mocker
assisted
her
into
the
vehicle
the
latter
took
his
place
by
her
side
and
in
another
moment
she
was
whirled
away
out
of
sight
all
drowned
in
tears
and
leaving
the
others
in
like
condition
it
seems
just
like
a
funeral
sobbed
ada
oh
will
she
never
never
come
back
any
more
perhaps
she
may
dear
said
the
mother
wiping
away
her
own
tears
we
will
try
to
think
so
at
least
and
be
cheerful
and
happy
in
looking
forward
to
that
time
and
in
the
meanwhile
we
may
hope
for
a
letter
now
and
then
oh
cried
rupert
that
reminds
me
that
there
a
letter
in
the
office
for
you
now
mother
i
saw
it
there
but
had
no
money
with
me
to
pay
the
postage
if
you
give
me
the
two
shillings
i
run
and
get
it
now
do
so
my
son
keith
said
giving
him
the
money
i
sorry
you
forgot
it
and
did
not
get
it
out
in
time
for
aunt
wealthy
to
see
it
letters
were
rarities
in
those
days
and
the
older
members
of
the
family
awaited
rupert
return
from
the
with
a
good
deal
of
eagerness
not
unmixed
with
anxiety
he
was
not
long
gone
for
he
too
was
curious
in
regard
to
it
desirous
to
learn
its
contents
and
who
was
the
writer
it
post
marked
detroit
he
said
delivering
it
to
his
mother
i
ca
think
who
be
likely
to
write
to
any
of
us
from
there
unless
it
might
be
captain
or
edward
wells
he
added
with
a
quizzical
glance
at
mildred
the
hand
looks
familiar
remarked
keith
carefully
breaking
the
seal
then
opening
out
the
sheet
horace
dinsmore
she
exclaimed
and
he
is
coming
to
see
us
oh
what
a
pity
that
aunt
wealthy
has
just
missed
him
a
pity
indeed
echoed
her
husband
but
he
may
stay
with
us
some
weeks
and
perhaps
take
lansdale
on
his
way
home
i
hope
he
wo
wo
stay
here
long
i
mean
muttered
rupert
in
an
aside
to
mildred
i
did
like
him
the
other
time
nor
i
very
much
but
perhaps
he
has
improved
mother
who
is
he
the
younger
ones
were
asking
my
cousin
his
mother
and
mine
were
sisters
were
are
they
now
queried
zillah
yes
dear
but
they
both
went
home
to
heaven
many
years
ago
my
mother
first
before
aunt
eva
married
dinsmore
and
went
away
down
south
to
live
but
wait
till
i
have
read
the
letter
and
then
you
may
ask
all
the
questions
you
wish
it
was
not
a
lengthy
epistle
keith
glanced
over
it
then
read
it
aloud
its
tone
was
cousinly
and
affectionate
the
writer
stated
that
he
had
lately
graduated
from
college
and
was
now
taking
a
tour
to
rest
and
refresh
himself
after
many
months
of
hard
study
that
he
had
arrived
in
detroit
would
tarry
there
a
week
and
then
journey
on
into
indiana
to
visit
his
relatives
in
pleasant
plains
this
letter
has
been
some
time
on
the
way
keith
remarked
examining
the
date
and
really
i
think
he
may
walk
in
upon
us
day
after
then
we
better
be
getting
ready
for
him
exclaimed
mildred
starting
up
in
her
energetic
way
wait
a
little
mother
promised
to
tell
us
about
him
cried
the
children
yes
and
will
there
time
enough
milly
mildred
resumed
her
seat
for
she
too
wanted
to
hear
all
her
mother
had
to
tell
my
mother
keith
began
was
two
years
younger
than
aunt
wealthy
who
was
the
daughter
of
my
grandfather
by
his
first
wife
therefore
only
half
sister
to
my
mother
and
aunt
eva
who
were
the
children
of
the
second
aunt
eva
was
five
years
younger
than
my
mother
and
was
still
single
when
mother
died
which
as
you
have
all
heard
was
when
i
her
only
child
was
but
little
more
than
two
years
old
cousin
horace
too
was
the
only
child
of
his
mother
and
quite
a
little
fellow
when
she
died
i
was
there
on
a
visit
at
the
time
and
did
what
i
could
to
comfort
him
we
grew
quite
fond
of
each
other
then
and
have
always
been
so
ever
since
though
we
have
lived
far
apart
and
met
very
seldom
has
he
got
a
father
asked
cyril
and
does
he
live
with
him
yes
he
has
a
father
and
lives
with
him
when
he
is
at
home
but
for
years
past
most
of
his
time
has
been
spent
at
school
and
college
i
thought
cousin
horace
had
brothers
and
sisters
rupert
said
inquiringly
yes
his
father
soon
married
again
and
has
a
large
family
by
the
second
wife
what
is
cousin
horace
like
mother
asked
ada
wait
until
he
comes
and
see
for
yourself
was
the
smiling
rejoinder
how
glad
you
look
mother
said
mildred
are
you
really
so
much
pleased
that
he
is
coming
why
certainly
my
child
he
is
my
near
kinsman
and
as
i
have
just
told
you
i
am
very
fond
of
him
he
like
a
dear
younger
brother
to
me
and
particularly
welcome
just
now
as
his
coming
will
take
from
the
dreadfully
lonely
feeling
aunt
wealthy
departure
has
given
the
house
but
mother
we
ca
entertain
him
suitably
we
so
cramped
for
room
and
our
house
only
and
he
is
used
to
living
in
such
grand
style
you
know
you
have
often
told
me
about
it
what
a
beautiful
place
roselands
is
and
how
many
carriages
and
horses
and
what
a
retinue
of
servants
they
keep
keith
smiled
kindly
at
the
anxious
face
turned
toward
hers
well
daughter
dear
we
just
do
the
best
we
can
for
him
and
it
wo
hurt
him
to
try
roughing
it
in
the
backwoods
or
prairies
rather
for
a
little
while
well
it
a
little
better
than
if
he
had
come
while
we
were
in
the
old
yellow
house
we
a
nice
porch
here
and
a
front
yard
shaded
with
grand
old
oaks
and
no
neighbors
near
enough
to
watch
every
movement
a
good
many
conveniences
too
added
her
mother
cheerily
and
a
beautiful
view
of
river
and
town
i
think
too
that
we
can
manage
to
give
him
a
room
to
himself
and
to
feed
him
well
with
the
help
of
rupert
garden
the
cow
and
the
chickens
the
expectation
of
this
visit
was
a
real
blessing
to
the
family
to
keith
and
mildred
in
especial
just
at
this
time
giving
occupation
to
their
thoughts
as
well
as
hands
in
the
necessary
preparation
for
the
proper
accommodation
and
entertainment
of
the
coming
guest
thus
preventing
much
of
the
sadness
the
loss
of
miss
stanhope
loved
society
would
have
caused
them
the
next
arrival
of
the
stage
brought
horace
dinsmore
his
servant
and
luggage
to
their
door
dinsmore
was
a
handsome
youth
of
distinguished
appearance
and
with
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
yet
evidently
a
kind
master
for
his
man
john
a
spruce
young
negro
seemed
to
take
the
greatest
pride
and
pleasure
in
waiting
upon
massa
horace
and
anticipating
his
every
wish
while
warmly
welcoming
her
young
relative
keith
was
somewhat
dismayed
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
servant
house
room
being
so
scarce
but
the
difficulty
was
obviated
by
placing
a
in
the
empty
loft
of
the
newly
erected
stable
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
how
very
thoughtless
and
selfish
in
cousin
horace
to
bring
that
fellow
along
mildred
said
to
her
mother
no
my
dear
not
when
we
consider
that
they
have
always
been
together
and
neither
would
know
very
well
how
to
do
without
the
other
i
was
the
thoughtless
one
not
to
remember
that
and
expect
john
always
together
mother
yes
they
are
nearly
the
same
age
john
a
few
months
older
than
his
young
master
and
were
playfellows
in
infancy
john
mother
was
horace
as
the
children
down
south
call
their
nurses
and
i
think
loved
her
white
nursling
even
better
than
her
own
children
john
affection
for
horace
is
probably
as
great
and
it
would
come
near
breaking
his
heart
to
be
separated
from
him
horace
dinsmore
had
paid
a
visit
to
lansdale
the
year
before
the
removal
of
the
keiths
to
indiana
the
impression
he
had
then
made
upon
his
young
cousins
was
not
at
all
favorable
he
was
silent
morose
and
seemed
to
take
little
or
no
interest
in
anybody
or
anything
he
is
not
like
himself
keith
had
said
to
aunt
wealthy
again
and
again
he
is
in
trouble
some
great
sorrow
has
come
to
him
but
they
did
not
succeed
in
winning
his
confidence
he
rejected
their
sympathy
locked
up
his
secret
in
his
own
bosom
and
left
them
as
sad
and
moody
as
when
he
came
he
was
changed
for
the
better
now
was
cheerful
at
times
even
gay
and
showed
much
interest
in
them
and
their
affairs
making
them
valuable
presents
for
he
had
large
means
and
a
generous
nature
some
gifts
of
jewelry
and
children
toys
he
had
brought
with
him
and
in
addition
he
presented
mildred
and
rupert
each
with
a
town
lot
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
their
new
home
keith
in
his
sturdy
pride
of
independence
was
inclined
to
reject
these
last
but
his
wife
said
no
stuart
do
not
you
will
hurt
horace
feelings
the
land
is
very
cheap
the
price
of
it
nothing
to
him
with
his
large
wealth
i
know
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
him
to
give
it
to
the
children
keith
yielded
the
point
and
said
nothing
dinsmore
not
being
a
religious
man
and
belonging
to
a
very
proud
and
aristocratic
family
was
not
one
to
mingle
with
those
he
denominated
the
common
herd
as
his
cousin
well
knew
therefore
only
a
few
of
their
acquaintances
the
educated
and
refined
were
invited
to
meet
him
and
accompany
them
on
some
little
excursions
riding
boating
and
fishing
gotten
up
for
his
entertainment
he
made
himself
agreeable
on
these
occasions
an
easy
thing
for
him
to
do
with
his
handsome
person
polished
manners
and
good
conversational
powers
but
soon
let
it
be
known
to
his
relatives
that
he
decidedly
preferred
exclusively
family
parties
after
that
they
had
only
such
while
he
staid
which
was
for
several
weeks
illustration
chapter
nineteenth
seldom
shall
she
hear
a
tale
so
sad
so
tender
and
so
true
horace
dinsmore
showed
much
interest
in
mildred
seemed
to
like
to
watch
her
let
her
employment
be
what
it
might
and
to
have
her
company
in
long
solitary
walks
and
drives
several
times
he
remarked
to
her
mother
that
she
was
growing
very
lovely
in
person
and
was
a
girl
of
fine
mind
adding
that
he
sincerely
hoped
she
would
not
throw
herself
away
upon
some
country
boor
the
two
keith
and
dinsmore
were
alone
in
the
one
pleasant
afternoon
early
in
september
when
this
remark
was
made
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
alone
except
that
little
annis
was
playing
about
the
floor
apparently
absorbed
with
toy
and
her
doll
keith
was
sewing
her
cousin
who
had
been
pacing
to
and
fro
now
standing
before
her
she
lifted
her
head
with
a
startled
look
horace
do
forget
that
you
and
mildred
are
cousins
he
colored
slightly
then
laughingly
answered
to
her
thought
rather
than
her
words
do
be
alarmed
marcia
i
not
thinking
of
her
in
that
way
at
all
his
face
suddenly
clouded
as
with
some
gloomy
recollection
marcia
he
said
taking
a
chair
near
her
side
my
visit
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
before
i
go
i
came
with
the
purpose
of
doing
so
but
hitherto
my
heart
has
failed
me
we
seem
to
be
alone
in
the
house
and
perhaps
there
will
be
no
better
time
than
this
i
think
not
she
said
we
can
secure
ourselves
from
intrusion
by
locking
the
door
he
rose
turned
the
key
and
came
back
he
did
not
speak
again
for
a
moment
but
sat
watching
annis
with
a
peculiar
expression
which
excited
his
cousin
surprise
and
curiosity
and
not
for
the
first
time
either
she
had
noted
it
before
the
child
seemed
to
both
attract
and
repel
him
more
than
once
keith
had
seen
him
snatch
her
up
suddenly
with
a
gesture
of
strong
affection
only
to
set
her
down
the
next
minute
and
turn
away
as
if
from
something
painful
to
look
upon
what
is
it
you
see
in
my
baby
horace
she
asked
laying
her
hand
affectionately
upon
his
arm
she
is
a
sweet
pretty
little
thing
yet
it
gives
me
more
pain
than
pleasure
to
look
at
her
he
said
sighing
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
brow
you
can
not
imagine
why
it
should
he
went
on
smiling
sadly
into
his
cousin
wondering
face
because
there
is
a
page
in
my
past
life
that
you
have
never
read
his
features
worked
with
emotion
he
rose
and
paced
the
floor
back
and
forth
several
times
then
coming
to
her
side
again
marcia
i
have
been
a
husband
i
am
a
father
my
little
girl
whom
i
have
never
seen
must
be
just
about
the
age
of
annis
you
horace
you
are
but
twenty
years
old
dropping
her
work
to
look
up
at
him
in
utter
amazement
i
knew
you
would
be
astonished
that
you
could
hardly
credit
it
but
it
is
true
then
resuming
his
seat
he
poured
out
in
impassioned
language
the
story
already
so
well
known
to
the
readers
of
the
elsie
books
of
his
visit
to
new
orleans
three
years
before
this
his
hasty
and
clandestine
marriage
to
the
beautiful
heiress
elsie
grayson
their
speedy
separation
by
her
guardian
and
big
father
the
subsequent
birth
of
their
little
daughter
and
the
death
of
the
young
mother
following
so
soon
thereafter
her
work
forgotten
her
hands
lying
idly
in
her
lap
her
eyes
gazing
intently
into
his
keith
listened
in
almost
breathless
silence
the
tears
coursing
down
her
cheeks
during
the
saddest
passages
my
poor
horace
my
poor
dear
cousin
she
said
when
he
had
finished
oh
it
was
hard
very
hard
why
did
you
never
tell
me
before
i
could
not
marcia
he
answered
in
tremulous
tones
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
spoken
my
darling
name
since
since
i
knew
that
she
was
lost
to
me
forever
forever
oh
do
not
say
that
you
have
told
me
she
was
a
sweet
christian
girl
and
none
who
trust
in
jesus
can
ever
be
lost
but
to
me
i
am
no
christian
he
sighed
but
you
may
become
one
the
invitation
is
to
you
unto
me
and
the
blessed
assurance
that
cometh
unto
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
he
sat
silent
his
face
averted
his
head
bowed
upon
his
hands
she
waited
a
moment
then
spoke
again
your
child
horace
she
is
at
viamede
with
the
guardian
and
you
have
never
seen
her
no
oh
how
can
you
bear
it
does
your
heart
yearn
over
her
do
you
long
to
have
her
in
your
arms
no
why
should
i
she
robbed
me
of
her
my
darling
wife
but
you
do
not
know
that
and
certainly
it
was
innocently
if
at
all
that
has
always
been
my
feeling
you
ought
not
to
allow
yourself
to
feel
so
she
said
almost
indignantly
poor
little
motherless
darling
must
she
be
worse
than
fatherless
too
what
would
you
have
marcia
he
asked
coldly
his
face
still
turned
from
her
what
could
i
do
with
a
child
and
she
is
well
off
where
she
is
better
than
she
could
be
anywhere
else
under
the
care
of
a
pious
old
scotch
woman
who
has
been
in
the
grayson
family
for
many
years
and
that
of
her
mammy
who
nursed
her
mother
before
her
a
faithful
old
creature
so
proud
and
fond
of
her
young
mistress
that
i
doubt
if
she
would
have
hesitated
to
lay
down
her
life
for
her
that
is
well
so
far
as
it
goes
horace
but
do
you
wish
your
child
to
grow
up
a
stranger
to
you
would
you
have
no
hand
in
the
moulding
of
her
character
the
training
of
her
mind
i
had
not
thought
of
that
he
said
sighing
but
i
do
not
feel
competent
to
the
task
but
it
is
your
work
a
work
god
himself
has
appointed
you
in
giving
you
the
child
a
work
for
which
he
will
give
wisdom
if
you
seek
it
of
him
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
who
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
and
if
you
neglect
it
my
dear
cousin
bear
with
me
while
i
say
it
it
will
be
at
your
peril
how
do
you
mean
marcia
the
day
may
come
when
you
will
want
that
child
love
and
obedience
when
you
will
covet
them
more
than
any
other
earthly
good
and
perhaps
find
that
they
are
denied
you
it
is
possible
you
may
be
right
in
regard
to
the
first
he
said
haughtily
his
dark
eyes
flashing
as
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
again
but
as
to
the
other
her
obedience
it
will
be
strange
indeed
if
i
can
not
compel
it
she
may
have
a
strong
will
but
she
will
find
that
mine
is
yet
stronger
horace
said
his
cousin
earnestly
if
you
refuse
or
neglect
to
do
a
father
duty
by
her
what
right
can
you
have
to
claim
a
child
duty
from
her
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
neglected
my
duty
toward
her
thus
far
he
said
still
haughtily
as
i
have
already
explained
she
is
where
in
my
judgment
she
is
better
off
for
the
present
than
she
could
be
anywhere
else
what
changes
may
come
in
the
future
i
do
not
know
forgive
me
if
i
have
seemed
to
blame
you
undeservedly
keith
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
ah
my
heart
yearns
over
that
poor
baby
she
caught
up
her
own
and
kissed
it
passionately
as
she
spoke
ah
she
sighed
pressing
the
little
creature
to
her
bosom
whatever
would
my
darlings
do
without
a
father
and
a
mother
love
he
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
there
for
several
minutes
then
coming
back
marcia
he
said
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
write
about
this
to
aunt
wealthy
and
tell
her
i
have
always
felt
ashamed
of
my
behavior
during
my
visit
to
you
both
two
years
ago
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
explain
then
the
cause
of
my
what
shall
i
call
it
sullenness
it
must
have
looked
like
it
to
you
and
her
and
to
all
who
saw
me
but
you
will
understand
it
now
and
perhaps
have
some
charity
for
me
we
had
then
horace
she
said
we
were
sure
it
was
some
secret
grief
that
made
you
so
unlike
your
former
self
yes
i
will
write
to
aunt
wealthy
may
i
tell
your
story
to
mildred
also
not
now
please
when
i
am
gone
she
may
hear
it
excuse
another
question
do
you
know
anything
of
your
little
looks
i
have
heard
nothing
but
if
she
at
all
resembles
her
mother
she
must
be
very
pretty
and
you
have
never
even
asked
o
horace
i
afraid
you
think
me
very
heartless
he
said
coloring
but
you
must
make
some
allowance
for
my
being
a
man
women
i
think
feel
more
interest
in
such
things
than
we
of
the
sterner
sex
do
then
i
think
my
husband
must
be
an
exceptional
man
for
he
loves
his
children
very
dearly
and
takes
great
pride
in
their
beauty
and
intelligence
i
daresay
it
might
have
been
the
same
with
me
under
happier
circumstances
he
answered
in
a
bitter
tone
little
feet
came
pitpatting
through
the
hall
little
voices
were
asking
for
mother
dinsmore
opened
the
door
and
admitted
the
inseparable
three
mother
i
cold
said
fan
shivering
and
her
teeth
chattering
as
she
spoke
cold
darling
come
here
she
got
a
chill
remarked
cyril
sagely
i
as
warm
as
toast
real
hot
in
the
sun
where
we
been
playing
i
afraid
she
has
her
nails
are
quite
blue
keith
said
taking
one
small
hand
in
hers
come
dear
mother
will
put
you
to
bed
and
cover
you
up
nice
and
warm
and
give
you
something
hot
to
drink
me
too
mother
said
don
creeping
to
her
side
and
laying
his
head
on
her
shoulder
i
so
tired
and
my
head
aches
so
bad
his
cheeks
were
flushed
his
hands
hot
and
dry
you
too
mother
little
man
she
exclaimed
mother
is
so
sorry
for
you
both
have
you
been
cold
don
yes
and
it
creeps
down
my
back
now
take
care
of
annis
cyril
said
keith
and
excusing
herself
to
her
cousin
she
led
the
sick
ones
away
coming
back
after
some
little
time
i
found
ada
down
too
she
sighed
she
had
crept
away
by
herself
without
a
word
to
any
one
poor
dear
child
wanting
to
trouble
mother
and
there
she
lay
shaking
till
the
very
bed
shook
under
her
it
dreadful
cried
dinsmore
positively
dreadful
marcia
how
can
you
stand
it
i
believe
there
has
hardly
been
a
week
since
i
came
when
you
were
all
well
ah
that
because
there
are
so
many
of
us
she
answered
laughing
though
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
why
do
you
stay
here
i
pack
up
everything
and
be
off
instanter
necessity
knows
no
law
she
said
cyril
son
can
you
go
down
to
the
spring
and
get
some
fresh
water
for
the
sick
ones
yes
i
take
the
biggest
bucket
cause
folks
always
want
to
drink
so
much
water
when
the
chill
on
cyril
knows
that
by
experience
his
mother
remarked
as
the
boy
left
the
room
why
do
you
speak
of
staying
here
as
a
necessity
marcia
asked
her
cousin
you
had
as
large
a
fortune
from
your
mother
as
i
from
mine
riches
take
wings
horace
and
a
large
family
and
unfortunate
investments
supplied
them
to
mine
she
spoke
cheerfully
jestingly
as
though
it
were
but
occasion
for
mirth
but
his
tone
was
full
of
concern
as
he
answered
indeed
i
never
knew
that
it
is
a
thousand
pities
i
wonder
you
can
be
so
content
and
as
you
seem
ah
i
have
so
much
left
all
my
chiefest
treasures
husband
children
many
great
and
precious
promises
for
both
this
life
and
the
next
ah
but
if
you
stay
here
how
long
are
you
likely
to
keep
husband
and
children
not
to
speak
of
the
danger
to
your
own
life
and
health
sickness
and
death
find
entrance
everywhere
in
this
sad
world
she
said
her
voice
trembling
slightly
and
in
all
places
we
are
under
the
same
loving
care
it
seems
our
duty
to
stay
here
and
the
path
of
duty
is
the
safest
it
is
thought
that
in
a
few
years
this
will
become
a
healthy
country
i
hope
so
indeed
for
your
sake
but
it
is
a
hard
one
for
you
in
other
ways
i
am
not
so
unobservant
as
not
to
have
discovered
that
you
do
a
great
deal
of
your
own
work
and
i
do
like
that
it
should
be
so
marcia
you
are
very
kind
she
answered
smiling
up
brightly
into
his
face
as
he
stood
looking
down
upon
her
with
a
vexed
and
anxious
expression
it
is
very
nice
to
have
you
care
so
much
for
me
horace
there
nobody
in
the
world
i
care
more
for
marcia
he
said
and
going
over
some
of
our
late
talk
in
my
mind
i
have
thought
there
is
nobody
to
whom
i
should
so
much
like
to
commit
the
care
and
training
of
my
child
i
mean
of
course
if
your
hands
were
not
already
full
and
more
than
full
with
your
own
they
are
not
so
full
that
i
would
not
gladly
do
a
mother
part
by
her
she
answered
with
emotion
were
it
not
for
the
danger
of
bringing
her
to
this
climate
yes
that
is
the
difficulty
it
would
never
do
so
miasmatic
and
so
cold
and
bleak
during
a
great
part
of
the
year
especially
for
one
born
so
far
south
but
i
thank
you
cousin
all
the
same
we
have
not
much
sickness
here
except
ague
she
remarked
presently
but
there
are
several
varieties
of
that
chills
and
fever
occurring
at
regular
intervals
generally
every
other
day
at
about
the
same
hour
dumb
ague
shaking
ague
and
sinking
or
congestive
chills
which
last
are
the
only
very
alarming
kind
sometimes
proving
fatal
in
a
few
hours
indeed
you
almost
frighten
me
away
he
said
half
seriously
half
in
jest
that
is
not
a
very
common
form
i
hope
no
rather
rare
do
you
send
for
the
doctor
not
often
now
we
did
at
first
but
it
is
so
frequent
a
visitor
that
we
have
learned
to
manage
it
ourselves
the
sickly
season
had
fairly
set
in
and
more
afraid
of
it
than
he
liked
to
acknowledge
dinsmore
hastened
his
departure
leaving
for
the
east
by
the
next
stage

illustration
chapter
twentieth
i
marked
the
spring
as
she
pass
along
with
her
eye
of
light
and
her
lip
of
song
while
she
stole
in
peace
the
green
earth
breast
while
the
streams
sprang
out
from
their
icy
rest
the
buds
bent
low
to
the
breeze
sigh
and
their
breath
went
forth
in
the
scented
sky
when
the
fields
look
fresh
in
their
sweet
repose
and
the
young
dews
slept
on
the
rose
willis
gaylord
clark
well
i
both
glad
and
sorry
horace
is
gone
keith
remarked
with
a
smile
a
sigh
and
a
dewy
look
about
her
eyes
as
the
stage
passed
out
of
sight
i
fond
of
the
lad
but
was
troubled
lest
the
ague
should
get
hold
of
him
besides
the
dearest
of
guests
is
something
of
a
burden
with
sickness
in
the
house
and
a
scarcity
of
help
yes
that
is
very
true
mother
mildred
answered
and
so
thoroughly
do
i
realize
it
that
i
am
wholly
and
heartily
glad
he
gone
albeit
i
liked
him
much
better
this
time
than
i
did
before
celestia
ann
had
left
months
ago
and
they
had
had
very
indifferent
help
during
dinsmore
visit
though
fortunately
such
as
they
could
keep
away
from
the
table
when
their
guest
was
present
at
it
mildred
went
on
now
to
express
her
satisfaction
that
such
had
been
the
case
adding
what
would
he
have
done
if
miss
hunsinger
had
been
here
and
in
her
usual
fashion
asserted
her
right
to
show
that
she
felt
herself
as
good
as
he
or
anybody
else
he
have
annihilated
her
with
a
look
laughed
rupert
he
would
have
acted
like
the
perfect
gentleman
he
is
said
keith
but
it
would
have
been
exceedingly
mortifying
to
me
to
have
him
so
insulted
at
my
table
for
as
he
has
been
brought
up
he
could
not
avoid
feeling
it
an
insult
to
be
put
on
a
social
equality
with
one
so
rude
and
vulgar
the
house
feels
lonely
said
zillah
it
seems
as
if
aunt
wealthy
had
just
gone
away
we
get
our
sewing
and
a
book
said
her
mother
come
all
into
the
rupert
may
be
the
reader
this
time
mildred
you
and
i
will
have
to
be
very
busy
now
with
the
fall
sewing
yes
mother
dear
it
a
blessing
to
have
plenty
of
employment
but
do
you
think
i
shall
need
to
give
up
my
studies
for
a
time
no
daughter
i
hope
not
i
want
you
to
go
on
with
them
lord
says
you
are
doing
so
nicely
your
cousin
too
told
me
he
thought
you
were
getting
a
better
more
thorough
education
with
him
than
you
would
be
likely
to
in
any
school
for
girls
that
he
knows
of
mildred
eyes
sparkled
and
cousin
horace
took
a
warmer
place
in
her
affections
than
he
had
held
before
it
was
well
for
it
needed
all
that
to
keep
her
from
disliking
him
for
his
indifference
toward
his
motherless
little
one
when
a
few
days
later
she
heard
his
story
from
her
mother
lips
they
had
a
very
busy
fall
and
winter
missing
sorely
miss
loved
companionship
and
her
help
in
the
family
sewing
the
putting
up
of
fruit
the
pickling
and
preserving
indeed
in
every
department
of
household
work
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
care
of
the
sick
letters
came
from
her
at
rare
intervals
for
mails
were
infrequent
in
those
days
and
postage
was
very
high
were
read
and
then
put
carefully
by
to
be
enjoyed
again
when
time
and
opportunity
could
be
found
for
another
perusal
they
were
not
the
brief
statements
of
facts
that
letters
of
the
present
day
generally
are
but
long
chatty
epistles
giving
in
pleasing
detail
her
own
doings
and
those
of
old
friends
and
acquaintances
and
all
that
had
happened
in
lansdale
since
they
left
telling
of
her
pets
of
the
books
she
read
and
what
she
thought
of
them
then
there
were
kind
inquiries
conjectures
as
to
what
they
were
doing
and
thinking
answers
to
their
questions
and
words
of
counsel
and
of
tender
sympathy
in
their
joys
and
sorrows
many
a
laugh
did
they
give
their
readers
and
many
a
tear
was
dropped
upon
their
pages
they
so
loved
the
dear
old
lady
and
could
almost
hear
the
sweet
tones
of
her
voice
as
they
read
or
repeated
to
each
other
her
quaint
sayings
fall
and
winter
passed
bringing
with
them
no
marked
changes
in
the
family
but
very
much
the
same
round
of
work
study
and
diversion
as
in
the
former
year
the
children
grew
mentally
and
physically
now
mother
and
now
sister
mildred
teaching
the
young
ideas
how
to
shoot
for
they
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
resigning
the
precious
darlings
to
the
tender
mercies
of
damaris
drybread
whose
school
was
still
the
only
one
in
town
the
old
intimacy
was
kept
up
in
just
the
old
way
among
the
coterie
of
six
and
the
gossips
vainly
puzzled
their
brains
with
the
question
which
girl
was
the
admired
and
admirer
of
which
young
man
mildred
was
happily
freed
from
the
visits
of
ransquattle
of
which
lu
grange
had
become
the
impatient
and
disgusted
recipient
and
saw
little
of
gotobed
lightcap
who
upon
one
excuse
or
another
absented
himself
from
most
of
the
of
the
young
people
indeed
there
had
been
scarcely
any
intercourse
between
the
two
families
since
the
removal
of
the
keiths
from
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
lightcaps
for
there
was
no
similarity
of
taste
no
common
bond
of
interest
to
draw
them
together
nothing
in
truth
save
a
kind
and
friendly
feeling
toward
each
other
and
as
regarded
rhoda
jane
even
this
was
lacking
she
had
never
yet
forgiven
mildred
rejection
of
her
brother
and
almost
hated
her
for
it
though
she
knew
naught
of
her
added
offense
in
the
matter
of
the
criticism
on
his
letter
that
was
a
secret
which
gotobed
kept
faithfully
locked
in
his
own
breast
the
spring
opened
early
for
that
climate
with
warm
rains
that
brought
vegetation
forward
rapidly
the
keith
children
revelled
in
out
door
work
and
play
each
of
the
younger
ones
had
a
little
garden
to
dig
and
plant
as
he
or
she
pleased
and
a
pet
hen
or
two
in
the
chicken
yard
and
there
was
much
rivalry
as
to
who
should
have
the
earliest
vegetables
the
greatest
variety
of
flowers
the
largest
broods
of
young
chicks
or
the
most
newly
laid
eggs
to
present
to
father
and
mother
or
the
invalid
of
the
hour
for
the
old
enemy
ague
still
visited
them
occasionally
now
one
now
another
or
it
might
be
several
at
once
succumbing
to
its
attacks
however
the
lion
share
of
both
gardening
and
fell
to
rupert
who
busied
himself
out
of
study
hours
with
these
and
many
little
odd
jobs
of
repairing
and
adorning
such
as
mending
fences
putting
up
trellises
training
vines
and
trimming
shrubbery
and
trees
the
mother
and
mildred
found
so
much
to
do
within
doors
that
some
oversight
and
direction
of
these
younger
workers
and
the
partial
care
of
a
few
near
the
house
were
all
they
could
undertake
outside
they
had
been
without
a
domestic
for
some
weeks
had
passed
through
the
trying
ordeal
of
the
regular
spring
with
only
assistance
when
one
pleasant
may
morning
while
dishing
up
breakfast
their
hearts
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
the
sinewy
form
and
energetic
countenance
of
celestia
ann
hunsinger
as
she
stepped
in
at
the
kitchen
door
with
a
characteristic
salutation
how
d
mis
keith
you
do
want
no
help
round
here
do
ye
we
want
just
the
sort
of
help
we
be
sure
of
if
you
take
off
your
bonnet
and
stay
keith
answered
giving
her
a
hearty
grip
of
the
hand
then
that
what
i
do
and
no
mistake
returned
the
girl
setting
down
a
bundle
on
a
chair
with
the
remark
you
see
i
brought
some
my
duds
along
pulling
off
her
sunbonnet
and
hanging
it
on
a
nail
here
miss
mildred
let
me
smash
them
so
mis
keith
you
been
buildin
since
i
was
here
last
yes
a
new
kitchen
so
we
could
take
the
old
for
a
and
be
less
crowded
it
awful
nice
i
always
did
like
a
good
big
kitching
room
to
turn
round
and
keep
things
straight
it
going
to
be
nicer
still
celestia
ann
said
rupert
who
had
just
come
in
from
his
work
in
the
garden
and
was
washing
his
hands
preparatory
to
taking
a
seat
at
the
table
it
wants
a
coat
of
paint
on
the
outside
and
i
going
to
put
it
on
myself
well
i
never
she
ejaculated
do
ye
think
you
up
to
that
of
course
i
do
and
so
i
suppose
do
father
and
mother
or
they
would
have
consented
to
let
me
try
well
there
nothin
like
tryin
as
i
found
out
in
my
own
experience
returned
miss
hunsinger
using
her
potato
masher
vigorously
and
i
allers
enjoy
meetin
with
folks
that
willin
fur
it
but
do
you
know
mis
keith
to
me
like
ca
comes
the
easiest
to
most
human
critters
tongues
of
any
two
words
in
the
american
language
and
with
half
on
they
lyin
words
yes
more
lies
told
in
them
two
words
than
in
any
other
ten
so
there
as
she
laid
down
her
masher
to
stir
in
the
milk
butter
and
salt
i
afraid
there
is
only
too
much
truth
in
your
remark
said
keith
but
certainly
no
one
can
accuse
you
of
a
fondness
for
that
favorite
phrase
of
the
indolent
and
thank
you
mis
keith
i
lots
of
faults
and
failin
as
well
the
rest
o
the
human
family
but
i
certain
sure
there
ai
no
lazy
bone
in
my
body
here
these
taters
is
ready
to
set
on
the
table
and
i
see
you
got
your
steak
and
biscuits
dished
up
but
i
hai
inquired
after
the
anybody
got
the
agur
no
i
believe
we
are
all
well
this
morning
thanks
to
a
kind
providence
rupert
call
your
father
and
the
rest
to
breakfast
no
frowns
greeted
celestia
ann
as
she
with
her
accustomed
nonchalance
took
her
place
with
the
others
everybody
was
glad
to
see
her
because
her
arrival
meant
comparative
rest
for
mother
and
mildred
and
more
time
to
be
devoted
by
them
to
the
loving
care
and
entertainment
of
father
and
the
younger
children
after
breakfast
family
worship
then
keith
went
to
his
office
and
the
others
scattered
to
their
work
or
play
sunbonnets
and
hats
were
in
request
among
the
little
ones
for
mother
had
given
permission
to
go
out
if
they
would
be
careful
to
keep
on
the
gravel
walks
till
the
dew
was
off
the
grass
sister
mildred
gave
kind
assistance
and
away
they
ran
while
she
and
zillah
and
ada
old
enough
now
to
begin
to
be
useful
about
the
house
made
beds
dusted
and
set
things
to
rights
in
sleeping
and
dwelling
rooms
and
rupert
donned
a
suit
of
overalls
and
went
to
his
chosen
task
celestia
ann
needed
but
little
direction
or
oversight
and
in
half
an
hour
keith
repaired
to
the
what
a
pleasant
place
it
seemed
as
she
came
in
fresh
and
bright
from
its
recent
cleaning
neat
as
a
new
pin
the
open
windows
looking
out
upon
the
grassy
side
yard
with
its
shrubbery
and
trees
clothed
in
vivid
green
and
giving
a
charming
view
of
the
clear
waters
of
the
swiftly
flowing
river
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
is
it
a
lovely
morning
mother
cried
mildred
whose
graceful
figure
was
flitting
about
here
and
there
putting
a
few
finishing
touches
to
the
adornments
of
the
room
i
think
the
sunshine
was
never
brighter
the
air
never
sweeter
it
is
a
luxury
just
to
live
hark
to
that
robin
song
and
the
sweet
prattling
of
the
little
voices
you
and
i
love
so
well
and
i
feel
as
blithe
and
gay
as
a
bird
yes
dear
child
said
the
mother
happy
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
oh
how
great
is
his
goodness
to
us
unworthy
creatures
so
much
of
mercy
and
blessing
here
and
the
certainty
of
endless
joy
and
bliss
beyond
life
has
its
dark
and
dreary
days
but
after
all
there
is
more
of
brightness
to
those
who
look
for
it
than
of
gloom
i
believe
that
is
true
mother
responded
mildred
though
when
the
dark
and
dreary
days
are
upon
us
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
to
hold
fast
to
one
faith
i
do
love
this
time
of
year
she
added
leaning
from
the
window
to
watch
the
ferryboat
slowly
crossing
spring
full
of
sweet
days
and
roses
a
box
where
sweets
compacted
lie
come
let
us
go
out
i
think
we
may
spare
an
hour
to
the
garden
this
morning
keith
said
gayly
leading
the
way
what
a
blessing
among
others
it
is
to
have
a
good
reliable
girl
in
the
kitchen
yes
laughed
mildred
i
could
almost
have
hugged
celestia
ann
i
was
so
glad
to
see
her
what
do
you
suppose
brought
her
just
at
this
time
mother
need
of
money
for
summer
finery
i
presume
see
our
morning
glories
are
coming
up
nicely
mother
mother
and
milly
cried
fan
running
to
them
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
my
speckled
hen
has
thirteen
little
chicks
the
prettiest
bits
of
fuzzy
things
you
ever
saw
do
come
and
look
she
turned
and
sped
back
again
toward
the
chicken
yard
mother
and
sister
following
the
other
three
little
ones
were
there
watching
speckle
and
her
brood
with
intense
interest
see
see
mamma
milly
see
see
cried
baby
annis
in
a
flutter
of
delight
holding
her
little
skirts
close
to
her
chubby
legs
as
the
bits
of
fuzzy
things
ran
hither
and
thither
about
her
feet
pitty
chickies
dust
tum
out
of
eggs
yes
dears
they
are
very
pretty
keith
said
but
they
are
very
tender
little
things
so
be
careful
not
to
hurt
them
no
cyril
pick
them
up
and
be
sure
you
do
step
on
them
you
may
go
to
the
house
for
some
bread
crumbs
fan
and
you
and
annis
may
feed
them
this
permission
gave
great
pleasure
and
fan
small
feet
went
skipping
and
dancing
through
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
door
then
mother
must
look
at
annis
hen
sitting
on
her
nest
and
notice
how
the
older
broods
belonging
to
cyril
and
don
were
growing
in
size
and
strength
zillah
and
ada
also
and
hear
how
many
eggs
the
other
nests
had
furnished
this
morning
after
that
the
gardens
were
submitted
to
her
inspection
mildred
still
bearing
her
company
both
making
suggestions
and
giving
assistance
and
so
a
full
hour
had
slipped
by
before
they
returned
to
the
house
and
rupert
they
found
had
made
great
progress
with
his
work
i
painted
the
whole
end
mother
do
you
see
he
called
to
her
and
now
i
beginning
this
side
i
think
i
have
the
whole
job
done
you
have
been
very
industrious
she
said
but
do
make
haste
so
fast
that
it
will
not
be
done
well
oh
no
i
do
intend
to
he
was
at
the
top
of
his
ladder
and
near
the
roof
of
the
new
addition
to
their
house
take
care
my
son
said
keith
it
seems
to
me
your
ladder
does
stand
very
securely
is
there
no
danger
of
its
slipping
never
a
bit
mother
laughed
the
boy
why
what
should
make
it
slip
she
and
mildred
turned
and
walked
on
toward
the
front
of
the
house
had
just
set
foot
upon
the
porch
there
when
a
shout
from
rupert
startled
them
and
made
them
pause
and
look
back
at
him
they
saw
the
ladder
slip
slip
then
slide
rapidly
to
the
ground
while
with
a
cry
of
alarm
they
rushed
toward
him
but
they
were
much
too
far
off
to
reach
him
in
time
to
be
of
the
least
assistance
down
he
came
to
the
ground
falling
with
considerable
impetus
and
alighting
upon
his
feet
his
brush
in
one
hand
his
paint
pot
in
the
other
striking
with
a
force
that
sent
the
paint
all
over
his
person
he
reeled
and
dropped
are
you
hurt
oh
my
boy
are
you
much
hurt
asked
his
mother
tremulously
as
she
hurried
to
him
looking
very
pale
and
frightened
my
clothes
have
got
the
worst
of
it
i
believe
mother
he
said
laughing
and
staggering
to
his
feet
i
afraid
they
robbed
the
house
of
half
its
new
coat
the
others
came
running
from
and
garden
celestia
ann
poked
her
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
and
a
peal
of
laughter
met
him
from
all
sides
i
dare
say
i
cut
quite
a
comical
figure
he
said
taking
it
in
good
part
but
since
i
broken
no
bones
i
would
care
a
red
cent
if
it
was
for
the
loss
of
the
paint
and
the
damage
to
my
illegant
attire
what
a
fall
was
there
my
countrymen
since
you
are
unhurt
no
matter
for
the
clothes
even
if
they
were
an
elegant
suit
said
his
mother
with
a
sigh
of
relief
but
half
the
paint
gone
mother
or
at
least
put
upon
my
person
where
it
worse
than
useless
cried
the
lad
surveying
himself
with
an
expression
so
comically
lugubrious
that
there
was
a
fresh
explosion
of
mirth
never
mind
it
will
not
cost
a
great
deal
to
replace
it
said
keith
but
i
think
the
job
may
wait
now
till
we
can
get
a
regular
to
finish
it
up
what
would
you
have
me
give
up
so
easily
mother
and
own
myself
beaten
i
do
like
to
do
it
please
let
me
try
again
and
i
place
the
ladder
more
carefully
i
do
know
we
ask
your
father
first
there
no
special
haste
and
how
would
you
all
like
to
go
with
me
for
a
walk
a
nice
long
stroll
down
to
the
bridge
and
over
the
river
to
look
for
wild
flowers
the
proposal
was
greeted
with
loud
acclamations
and
clapping
of
hands
oh
delightful
oh
goodie
goodie
may
we
mother
yes
we
all
been
working
hard
this
long
time
and
i
think
really
deserve
a
holiday
rupert
make
yourself
decent
and
we
set
out
at
once
taking
a
lunch
with
us
so
that
we
need
not
hurry
home
tan
i
do
mamma
tan
annis
do
asked
the
baby
girl
eagerly
the
rosy
face
all
aglow
with
delight
yes
indeed
mother
darling
you
shall
go
in
your
little
coach
because
your
dear
little
feet
could
travel
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
rest
and
would
get
so
tired
do
we
need
to
be
dressed
up
mother
asked
fan
me
and
don
and
all
the
children
no
dear
we
do
go
through
town
and
are
dressed
quite
enough
for
the
woods
they
were
soon
on
the
way
strolling
leisurely
along
drinking
in
with
keen
enjoyment
the
sweet
sights
and
sounds
the
sky
over
their
heads
was
of
a
dark
celestial
blue
with
here
and
there
a
floating
cloud
of
snowy
whiteness
whose
shadow
flitted
over
the
landscape
giving
to
it
a
charming
variety
of
light
and
shade
their
road
lay
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
its
soft
murmur
mingled
with
the
hum
of
insects
and
the
song
of
birds
the
grass
beneath
their
feet
was
emerald
green
thickly
studded
with
wild
flowers
of
every
hue
and
the
groves
of
saplings
through
which
they
passed
were
fast
donning
their
summer
robes
the
bridge
was
a
rough
wooden
structure
half
a
mile
below
the
town
quite
out
of
danger
of
crowding
the
houses
of
the
citizens
or
doing
much
injury
to
the
custom
of
the
ferry
the
walk
was
a
longer
one
than
the
younger
children
were
accustomed
to
take
but
there
was
no
occasion
for
haste
they
were
in
search
of
rest
and
pleasure
and
when
little
feet
grew
weary
mother
let
them
stop
and
amuse
themselves
with
making
wreaths
and
bouquets
of
the
flowers
they
had
gathered
or
by
throwing
stones
into
the
river
till
they
were
ready
to
go
on
again
they
did
not
go
far
beyond
the
bridge
only
climbed
the
bank
on
the
other
side
picked
a
few
flowers
there
and
were
ready
to
return

henry
viiith
oh
what
that
what
that
cried
a
chorus
of
young
voices
as
keith
and
her
little
troop
returning
from
their
morning
stroll
stepped
into
the
front
porch
at
home
what
indeed
echoed
the
mother
as
much
surprised
as
any
one
of
the
others
it
looks
very
like
a
box
of
goods
but
where
could
it
come
from
aunt
wealthy
suggested
mildred
examining
it
with
a
curious
eye
ah
so
you
have
come
back
at
last
eh
said
keith
coming
out
with
a
smiling
face
that
been
waiting
for
you
for
over
an
hour
consulting
his
watch
come
let
have
dinner
and
then
we
see
inside
is
it
ready
asked
keith
taking
off
her
bonnet
yes
barely
time
for
the
washing
of
small
hands
and
faces
he
said
picking
up
annis
and
racing
off
to
the
nursery
with
her
for
so
they
called
the
room
where
the
little
ones
slept
and
were
dressed
and
undressed
though
but
a
small
part
of
the
day
was
ordinarily
spent
there
there
was
no
lingering
over
the
dinner
table
though
the
meal
was
a
good
one
and
the
children
appetites
had
been
sufficiently
keen
until
they
saw
the
box
they
ate
and
drank
with
dispatch
taking
time
for
but
little
talk
beyond
a
few
conjectures
as
to
its
probable
contents
father
and
mother
certainly
shared
their
curiosity
and
eagerness
to
some
extent
and
did
not
keep
them
waiting
long
a
few
minutes
work
with
the
hatchet
and
the
lid
was
off
just
newspapers
cried
don
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment

a
bit
laddie
laughed
rupert
something
else
under
i
guess
said
cyril
while
father
mother
and
mildred
made
haste
to
lift
and
lay
aside
the
papers
for
further
perusal
for
newspapers
were
too
rare
in
those
days
to
be
despised
even
though
some
weeks
old
books
oh
delightful
how
good
and
kind
in
her
now
we
have
a
feast
exclaimed
one
and
another
in
varying
tones
of
gladness
what
are
they
let
us
see
said
keith
proceeding
to
lift
them
out
one
or
two
at
a
time
and
with
a

exclaimed
mildred
the
next
instant
here
a
bundle
said
keith
handing
it
out
remnants
i
presume
his
wife
said
laughingly
and
opening
it
found
her
surmise
correct
groceries
candies
and
toys
for
the
children
and
some
few
other
miscellaneous
articles
filled
up
the
rest
of
this
most
welcome
box
dear
old
auntie
she
should
have
wasted
so
much
of
her
money
on
us
keith
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
glanced
over
a
note
pinned
to
a
dress
pattern
for
herself
but
she
says
she
has
enjoyed
it
intensely
and
i
know
that
is
so
for
giving
especially
to
us
is
her
greatest
delight
yes
there
never
was
a
more
generous
soul
assented
her
husband
ah
if
we
could
only
do
something
for
her
in
return
exclaimed
mildred
yes
indeed
what
a
feast
she
has
provided
us
cried
rupert
taking
a
peep
here
and
there
into
the
history
mother
ca
we
begin
on
them
this
afternoon
i
not
ready
for
lord
objected
mildred
and
in
an
hour
it
will
be
time
to
go
to
him
that
reminded
the
lad
that
he
too
had
a
lesson
to
prepare
and
he
left
the
room
to
attend
to
it
wife
said
keith

that
little
mary
chetwood

i
did
not
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
over
there
at
once
mother
said
mildred
i
been
thinking
it
would
be
nice
to
lend
one
of
these
books
to
effie
prescott
i
do
not
know
her
at
all
intimately
but
claudina
says
she
is
very
intelligent
and
fond
of
reading
and
in
such
poor
health
that
she
is
often
too
miserably
weak
and
ill
to
do
anything
but
read
certainly
she
must
have
the
reading
of
every
book
in
the
house
if
she
wishes
and
will
not
abuse
them
claudina
says
she
is
always
very
careful
of
those
she
lends
her
and
very
glad
to
get
them
she
a
lovely
christian
too
and
very
patient
under
her
trials
yes
i
have
been
pleased
with
the
little
i
have
seen
of
her
i
believe
i
owe
prescott
a
call
so
i
shall
take
their
house
on
my
way
to
the
squire
and
carry
a
book
with
me
keith
found
prescott
out
the
invalid
girl
lying
back
in
a
large
rocking
chair
and
damaris
drybread
seated
in
her
accustomed
bolt
upright
fashion
directly
opposite
at
sight
of
keith
effie
started
up
in
nervous
haste
and
trepidation
to
offer
her
hand
and
then
a
chair
never
mind
dear
child
i
will
help
myself
said
the
lady
pressing
the
trembling
hand
tenderly
in
hers
how
are
you
about
as
usual
thank
you
which
is
neither
very
sick
nor
very
well
the
girl
answered
with
a
faint
smile
sinking
back
again
breathing
short
and
hard
now
do
talk
so
you
look
very
well
remarked
miss
drybread
in
a
cold
hard
tone
just
make
up
your
mind
that
there
nothing
much
the
matter
and
you
not
going
to
give
up
to
the
hypo
and
ten
to
one
it
wo
be
long
till
you
find
yourself
well
enough
tears
sprang
to
effie
eyes
for
she
was
both
nervous
and
sensitive
to
the
last
degree
i
know
i
look
well
she
said
i
not
thin
and
i
have
a
good
color
but
it
often
brightest
when
i
feel
the
worst
and
i
tried
to
believe
my
sickness
was
all
imagination
but
i
ca
it
too
real
no
effie
you
do
not
look
well
said
keith
that
brilliant
bloom
hardly
belongs
to
health
and
your
eyes
are
heavy
your
countenance
is
distressed
of
course
she
wear
a
distressed
countenance
as
long
as
she
imagines
she
sick
observed
the
severely
and
you
keith
are
only
making
matters
worse
by
talking
in
that
way
not
so
said
the
sick
girl
such
kind
sympathy
does
me
good
oh
thank
you
a
thousand
times
as
keith
put
dunallan
into
her
hands
i
shall
enjoy
it
so
much
and
will
be
very
careful
of
it
and
return
it
soon
i
read
it
years
ago
and
liked
it
exceedingly
and
it
will
be
new
to
me
now
grace
kennedy
is
such
a
sweet
writer
what
a
pity
she
died
so
early
a
novel
sniffed
damaris
if
you
are
really
sick
you
ought
to
read
anything
but
the
bible
the
teachings
of
this
book
are
so
fully
in
accord
with
those
of
the
scriptures
that
i
can
not
think
it
will
hurt
her
said
keith
i
love
the
bible
said
effie
i
never
could
do
without
it
its
words
often
come
to
me
when
i
am
sad
and
suffering
and
are
than
honey
and
the
honeycomb
but
reading
other
good
books
seems
like
talking
with
a
christian
friend
and
refreshes
me
in
the
same
way
at
this
moment
prescott
came
in
and
greeting
the
two
callers
with
a
pleasant
good
afternoon
sat
down
to
chat
with
them
the
talk
presently
turned
upon
their
gardens
and
prescott
invited
the
visitors
to
walk
out
and
look
at
hers
keith
accepted
the
invitation
but
miss
drybread
said
she
would
just
sit
with
effie
till
they
came
back
are
you
teaching
now
miss
damaris
asked
the
girl
as
the
others
left
the
room
no
i
closed
my
school
for
a
couple
of
weeks
to
do
my
spring
sewing
it
was
kind
in
you
to
take
time
to
call
to
see
me
when
you
are
always
so
busy
i
try
to
attend
to
every
duty
returned
the
with
a
sanctimonious
air
and
i
felt
that
i
had
a
duty
to
perform
here
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
you
effie
trying
to
find
out
why
your
afflictions
are
sent
and
i
concluded
that
it
as
a
punishment
for
your
sins
and
that
when
you
repent
and
reform
your
health
will
be
better
you
know
christians
and
i
really
hope
you
one
i
know
you
belong
to
the
church
wo
have
any
punishment
in
the
other
world
so
they
have
to
take
it
in
this
and
so
as
i
said
i
been
considering
about
you
and
i
think
if
you
thought
better
of
brother
smith
and
enjoyed
his
sermons
and
prayers
and
talks
in
the
meetin
be
better
for
you
he
a
good
christian
and
so
you
ought
to
like
what
he
says
and
be
his
friend
with
other
folks
that
is
inclined
to
listen
to
him
he
may
be
a
christian
i
hope
he
is
returned
effie
though
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
realize
that
a
man
has
much
true
love
to
christ
and
for
souls
when
his
tone
and
manner
are
utterly
indifferent
and
business
like
or
perhaps
that
is
quite
the
right
word
for
men
generally
show
some
interest
in
their
business
besides
it
requires
other
things
in
addition
to
conversion
to
fit
a
man
for
teaching
he
must
have
knowledge
and
the
ability
to
impart
it
i
have
nothing
against
smith
personally
but
he
does
not
instruct
me
does
not
give
me
any
food
for
thought
or
help
me
on
my
way
to
heaven
so
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
object
to
having
him
become
my
pastor
but
i
have
been
going
about
slandering
him
and
do
know
why
you
come
and
talk
to
me
in
this
way
it
strikes
me
too
that
you
are
the
last
person
to
do
it
as
i
have
heard
you
say
far
harder
things
of
other
ministers
than
ever
i
said
of
him
an
angry
flush
rose
in
the
sallow
cheek
of
the
spinster
at
that
i
tried
to
do
my
duty
always
she
said
bridling
i
never
indulged
in
any
vanities
of
dress
but
that
been
one
of
your
sins
effie
prescott
bows
and
even
flowers
and
feathers
on
your
bonnets
and
knots
of
bright
ribbon
at
your
throat
and
in
your
hair
it
sinful
and
you
may
depend
you
be
afflicted
till
you
give
up
and
be
consistent
in
all
things
i
know
better
than
you
can
tell
me
that
i
deserve
all
i
suffer
and
a
great
deal
more
said
the
girl
humbly
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
but
for
all
that
i
do
believe
you
are
right
you
are
a
comforter
and
god
reproved
those
men
for
talking
so
to
him
and
do
you
remember
what
jesus
said
about
trying
to
take
the
mote
out
of
your
brother
eye
while
there
is
a
beam
in
your
own
i
see
its
time
for
me
to
go
said
damaris
rising
she
stood
a
moment
looking
at
effie
her
lips
compressed
her
face
white
and
her
eyes
ablaze
with
rage
there
no
christian
spirit
about
you
she
hissed
you
do
like
faithful
dealing
you
do
want
to
be
told
of
your
sins
very
well
miss
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
i
shake
off
the
dust
of
my
feet
against
you
and
with
arms
folded
on
her
breast
and
head
erect
she
stalked
out
of
the
house
leaving
the
invalid
girl
quivering
from
head
to
foot
with
nervous
excitement
and
distress
crying
and
laughing
hysterically
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
sighed
to
herself
i
have
behaved
in
a
christian
manner
i
was
angry
at
what
she
said
prescott
and
keith
were
strolling
in
from
the
garden
chatting
pleasantly
of
their
domestic
affairs
when
an
infant
screams
were
heard
coming
from
a
back
room
there
my
baby
is
awake
and
calling
for
his
mother
said
prescott
please
excuse
me
a
minute
just
step
into
the
parlor
again
and
talk
with
effie
keith
complied
and
found
effie
alone
lying
back
in
her
chair
trembling
flushed
and
tearful
my
poor
child
are
you
suffering
very
much
she
asked
bending
over
her
and
smoothing
her
hair
with
a
caressing
motion
no
i
not
worse
only
it
was
something
that
damaris
said
and
that
i
did
take
it
quite
as
i
ought
oh
keith
do
you
think
god
sends
sickness
to
punish
us
for
our
sins
and
that
my
health
is
poor
because
i
more
wicked
than
anybody
who
is
well
certainly
not
i
have
excellent
health
as
a
general
thing
while
many
an
eminent
saint
has
been
a
great
sufferer
we
know
that
sin
brought
disease
and
death
into
the
world
and
that
god
sometimes
sends
afflictions
as
chastisements
but
to
his
own
people
it
is
in
love
and
for
their
growth
in
grace
many
as
i
love
i
rebuke
and
chasten
be
zealous
therefore
and
repent
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
and
scourgeth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth
if
ye
endure
chastening
god
dealeth
with
you
as
with
sons
remembering
that
would
you
wish
to
escape
it
oh
no
no
but
oh
it
makes
the
burden
so
much
heavier
to
think
that
it
is
because
he
is
angry
with
me
it
is
because
he
loves
you
do
not
look
at
it
as
punishment
but
as
discipline
as
the
cutting
and
carving
which
are
necessary
to
bring
out
the
beautiful
statue
from
the
shapeless
block
of
marble
or
to
change
the
diamond
in
the
rough
to
the
brilliant
sparkling
gem
as
to
the
idea
that
the
christian
bears
any
part
of
the
penalty
of
his
sins
atoning
for
them
by
his
own
suffering
or
his
works
or
in
any
other
way
either
in
this
life
or
the
next
it
is
totally
unscriptural
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
o
thank
you
so
much
so
very
much
she
exclaimed
looking
up
gratefully
what
wonderful
love
his
was
and
who
would
not
be
willing
to
bear
any
suffering
to
be
made
like
unto
him
that
is
unquestionably
a
christian
spirit
said
keith
none
but
those
who
have
felt
the
burden
of
sin
and
learned
to
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
know
that
ardent
desire
for
conformity
to
his
image
you
make
my
heart
glad
cried
the
girl
damaris
just
told
me
there
was
no
christian
spirit
about
me
and
i
often
afraid
there
is
yet
i
do
love
jesus
and
desire
his
love
more
than
anything
else
i
want
to
do
and
suffer
all
his
holy
will
little
mary
chetwood
a
sweet
child
of
six
was
the
only
daughter
except
claudina
and
coming
after
some
half
dozen
boys
naturally
became
from
the
first
a
great
pet
and
darling
made
much
of
by
parents
sister
and
brothers
yet
she
was
not
a
spoiled
child
she
had
been
taught
obedience
religiously
trained
and
not
indulged
to
her
hurt
love
and
wise
indulgence
do
no
harm
but
quite
the
contrary
while
harshness
a
dearth
of
affection
and
undue
severity
have
ruined
many
a
one
for
time
and
eternity
keith
found
the
chetwoods
a
distressed
household
for
though
the
little
girl
had
been
but
two
days
ill
such
was
the
violence
of
the
attack
that
it
was
already
apparent
that
there
was
small
hope
of
recovery
this
is
kind
whispered
chetwood
pressing
her
friend
hand
while
tears
coursed
down
her
cheeks
the
darling
wo
be
tended
by
any
body
but
mother
father
or
sister
but
your
very
presence
is
a
comfort
i
should
have
been
here
sooner
but
did
not
know
of
her
illness
till
this
afternoon
keith
responded
in
the
same
subdued
key
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
i
will
take
off
my
bonnet
and
stay
it
is
perfectly
convenient
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
a
note
dispatched
to
mildred
entrusting
the
children
at
home
to
her
care

time
as
her
mother
could
be
of
no
more
service
at
the
squire
and
keith
gentle
ministries
in
the
sick
room
began
her
quiet
movements
her
thoughtfulness
quick
comprehension
and
fertility
of
resource
made
her
invaluable
at
such
a
time
the
end
came
sooner
than
was
expected
day
was
just
breaking
when
with
her
head
on
the
bosom
of
her
who
gave
her
birth
the
little
one
gently
breathed
her
last
in
all
the
trying
scenes
that
followed
and
keith
and
mildred
were
most
kind
helpful
and
sympathizing
and
the
ties
of
christian
friendship
were
thus
more
closely
drawn
than
ever
between
the
two
families
the
bereaved
family
found
their
home
sadly
desolated
but
there
was
no
murmuring
against
the
hand
that
dealt
the
blow
the
language
of
their
hearts
was
the
lord
gave
and

rupert
came
in

late
to
breakfast
from

down

and
reported
that
a
wonderfully
large
had
been
planted
in

and
that
the
stars
and
stripes
were
floating
from
its
top
the
sunday

were
to
unite
and
march
in

through

separate
and
each
school
betake
itself
to
its
own
church
there
to
enjoy
a
little
feast
prepared
by
the
parents

friends
of

there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
baking
going
on
in

kitchen
the
day
before
and
shortly
after
breakfast
a
large
basket
was
packed
with
delicacies
and
sent
to
the
church

and
mildred
had
their

full
for

so
in

the
children
and
themselves
for
the
grand
occasion
they
made
a
goodly
show
as
they
issued
from
the
gate
and
took
their
way
toward
the
place
of
rendezvous
the
girls
all
in
white
muslin
and
blue
ribbons
the
boys
in
their
neat
sunday
suits
and
each
with
a
flower
or
tiny
nosegay
in
his
the
house
had
to
be
shut
up
as
celestia
ann
claimed
the
holiday
but
was
left
in
its
usual
neat
and
orderly
condition
by
means
of
early
rising
and
extra
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
three
older
girls
otherwise
mildred
could
not
have
been
content
to
go
and
delay
was
dangerous
as
on
account
of
the
heat
of
the
weather
the
procession
was
to
move
by
nine
the
whole
town
was
in
holiday
attire
and
everywhere
smiling
faces
were
seen
a
shower
in
the
night
had
laid
the
dust
without
turning
it
to
mud
and
the
sunday
school
celebration
proved
quite
a
success
the
children
enjoyed
their
treat
of
cakes
candies
and
lemonade
then
the
little
keiths
went
home
tired
enough
to
be
glad
to
sit
down
and
rest
while
father
mother
and
milly
told
them
stories
of
other
fourths
that
they
could
remember
after
dinner
mildred
went
to
call
on
her
friend
claudina
carrying
with
her
another
book
for
effie
prescott
dunallan
had
been
returned
in
perfect
condition
and
with
a
little
note
of
thanks
effie
met
mildred
with
a
pleased
look
a
cheerful
greeting
and
warm
thanks
for
the
book
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
said
and
it
was
very
kind
in
you
to
come
for
i
am
owing
you
a
call
i
thought
i
should
have
paid
it
long
ago
but
there
are
so
many
days
when
i
do
feel
quite
equal
to
the
walk
you
do
walk
out
then
oh
yes
every
day
when
the
weather
is
good
that
is
part
of
the
cure
but
i
can
not
walk
fast
or
far
i
hope
you
are
improving
yes
i
believe
so
but
very
slowly
i
never
confined
to
bed
but
never
able
to
do
much
and
the
books
are
such
a
blessing
from
that
they
fell
into
talk
about
books
and
authors
and
were
mutually
pleased
to
find
their
tastes
were
similar
as
regarded
literature
and
that
their
religious
views
accorded
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
which
became
a
source
of
great
enjoyment
to
both
effie
had
learned
to
love
keith
that
drew
mildred
toward
her
and
their
common
faith
in
christ
and
love
to
him
was
a
yet
stronger
bond
of
union
they
regretted
that
they
had
been
so
long
comparative
strangers
and
mildred
felt
well
rewarded
for
the
kind
thoughtfulness
on
her
part
which
had
at
length
brought
them
together
but
leaving
effie
to
the
perusal
of
the
book
she
walked
on
to
squire
chetwood
chetwood
and
claudina
in
their
deep
mourning
dress
sat
quietly
at
home
with
no
heart
to
join
in
the
mirth
and
jollity
going
on
about
them
yet
calm
and
resigned
ah
sighed
the
mother
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
as
the
joyous
shouts
of
children
penetrated
to
their
silent
room
our
little
darling
would
have
been
so
gay
and
happy
but
why
do
i
say
that
i
know
she
is
far
far
happier
in
that
blessed
land
than
she
could
ever
possibly
have
been
here
i
know
that
said
claudina
weeping
and
i
do
rejoice
in
the
thought
of
her
blessedness
but
oh
the
house
is
so
dreary
and
desolate
without
her
o
mildred
how
rich
you
are
with
four
sisters
there
was
a
knock
at
the
street
door
answered
by
the
girl
and
the
next
moment
miss
drybread
walked
into
the
parlor
where
the
ladies
were
sitting
she
was
courteously
received
and
invited
to
take
a
seat
which
she
did
drawing
a
deep
sigh
are
you
well
miss
damaris
asked
chetwood
yes
i
always
well
i
try
and
do
right
and
have
no
sick
fancies
am
never
troubled
with
the
vapors
i
hope
you
well
as
usual
thank
you
you
had
a
great
affliction
no
response
for
the
torn
hearts
could
scarce
endure
the
rude
touch
her
tone
was
so
cold
and
hard
i
hope
you
resigned
she
went
on
you
know
we
ought
to
be
especially
considering
that
we
deserve
all
our
troubles
and
trials
i
trust
we
are
said
chetwood
we
can
rejoice
in
her
happiness
while
we
weep
for
ourselves
do
you
think
you
made
an
idol
of
that
child
i
think
you
did
and
that
that
is
the
reason
why
she
was
taken
for
god
wo
allow
idols
we
loved
her
very
dearly
sobbed
the
bereaved
mother
but
i
do
not
think
we
made
an
idol
of
her
or
ever
indulged
her
to
her
hurt
the
heart
is
deceitful
observed
the
with
emphasis
and
putting
on
mourning
and
shedding
so
many
tears
does
look
like
submission
and
resignation
i
do
see
how
a
christian
can
act
so
wait
till
you
are
bereaved
replied
the
mother
sobs
almost
choking
her
utterance
and
remember
how
jesus
wept
at
the
tomb
of
lazarus
and
that
he
never
reproved
the
jews
for
putting
on
sackcloth
and
ashes
when
mourning
for
their
dead
said
mildred
adding
in
her
uncontrollable
indignation
i
think
you
might
be
at
better
work
miss
drybread
than
wrenching
the
hearts
of
these
bereaved
ones
whom
jesus
loves
and
in
all
whose
afflictions
he
is
afflicted
i
only
doing
my
duty
retorted
the
spinster
the
bible
says
we
must
reprove
our
brethren
and
not
suffer
sin
upon
them
it
says
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
they
are
the
words
of
jesus
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
if
you
turn
to
the
passage
and
read
on
a
little
further
you
will
see
that
people
who
try
to
pull
the
mote
out
of
a
brother
eye
while
there
is
a
beam
in
their
own
he
calls
hypocrites
i
can
understand
an
insinuation
as
well
as
the
next
one
said
miss
drybread
rising
in
wrath
and
let
me
tell
you
miss
that
i
consider
you
the
most
impertinent
young
person
i
ever
met
good
afternoon
and
miss
chetwood
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
friend
and
she
swept
from
the
room
and
the
house
before
the
astonished
ladies
could
utter
a
word
what
a
disagreeable
old
hypocrite
cried
mildred
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
flashing
to
think
of
her
talking
to
you
in
that
cruel
manner
chetwood
and
claudina
but
there
i
am
judging
her
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
finished
with
a
burst
of
sobs
clasping
her
arms
about
her
friend
who
was
weeping
bitterly
chetwood
too
was
shedding
tears
but
presently
wiped
them
away
saying
we
will
try
to
forgive
and
forget
her
harsh
words
i
trust
she
is
a
and
perhaps
truly
good
woman
though
mistaken
as
to
her
duty
and
sadly
wanting
in
tact
on
her
way
home
mildred
passed
lightcap
she
usually
avoided
doing
so
by
taking
the
other
street
but
was
too
full
of
grief
for
her
bereaved
friends
to
care
which
way
her
steps
were
tending
till
they
were
arrested
by
lightcap
voice
speaking
from
her
open
door
why
if
it
ai
miss
keith
i
hai
seen
a
sight
o
you
this
long
time
walk
in
wo
you
and
sit
a
bit
they
all
run
off
somewheres
and
left
me
settin
here
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
and
i
dreadful
lonesome
mildred
could
not
well
refuse
the
invitation
so
stepped
in
and
took
a
seat
her
first
feeling
on
becoming
aware
that
lightcap
was
addressing
her
was
one
of
embarrassment
at
the
idea
of
facing
the
mother
of
her
rejected
suitor
but
the
next
instant
she
concluded
from
the
cordial
manner
of
her
neighbor
that
she
must
be
entirely
ignorant
of
the
affair
which
was
really
the
case
gotobed
having
insisted
upon
rhoda
jane
keeping
his
secret
mildred
was
not
in
a
talking
mood
but
lightcap
grew
garrulous
over
the
day
celebration
the
heat
of
the
weather
prophesying
that
if
it
lasted
long
coming
as
it
did
after
a
very
rainy
spring
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
sickness
branching
off
finally
to
her
housework
and
garden
two
inexhaustible
themes
with
her
an
occasional
yes
or
no
or
nod
of
acquiescence
was
all
that
was
necessary
on
the
part
of
her
listener
and
these
mildred
could
supply
without
giving
her
undivided
attention
to
the
steady
flow
of
empty
talk
the
firing
of
the
cannon
at
short
intervals
had
been
kept
up
all
day
boom
it
came
now
causing
lightcap
to
give
a
sudden
start
and
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
well
i
declare
she
exclaimed
i
ca
git
used
to
that
there
firin
and
i
jest
wisht
they
stop
it
some
on
gits
hurt
it
a
dreadful
dangerous
thing
gunpowder
is
and
i
guess
there
never
a
fourth
when
there
do
somebody
git
about
half
killed
or
quite
said
mildred
people
will
be
so
careless
and
i
suppose
that
even
with
the
greatest
care
there
must
be
some
danger
from
the
bursting
of
guns
and
other
accidents
that
it
is
perhaps
impossible
to
guard
against
mildred
sat
very
near
the
open
door
lightcap
farther
within
the
room
well
as
i
was
a
sayin
began
the
latter
resuming
the
thread
of
her
discourse
some
one
came
running
without
his
heavy
footsteps
resounding
upon
the
sidewalk
it
was
a
man
he
paused
before
the
door
looking
pale
and
frightened
and
beckoning
to
mildred
said
in
a
low
hurried
tone
just
step
this
way
a
minute
miss
i
want
to
speak
to
you
hardly
comprehending
too
much
taken
by
surprise
even
to
wonder
what
he
could
want
she
hastily
complied
she
ought
to
be
prepared
you
know
he
went
on
in
the
same
breathless
agitated
manner
drawing
her
further
away
from
the
door
as
he
spoke
he
awfully
hurt
killed
i
believe
and
they
bringin
him
up
the
street
now
who
gasped
mildred
her
son
gote
gun
went
off
while
he
was
ramming
in
the
wadding
and
shot
the
ramrod
right
through
his
hands
i
guess
they
both
have
to
come
off
mildred
staggered
back
sick
and
faint
and
with
a
dazed
sort
of
feeling
that
she
was
somehow
to
blame
they
comin
repeated
the
man
hurriedly
pointing
to
a
little
crowd
of
men
and
boys
moving
slowly
up
the
street
scarcely
a
square
away
ca
you
say
something
to
her
kind
o
break
the
shock
a
little
you
know
lightcap
had
stepped
into
the
door
way
and
was
looking
this
way
and
that
curious
to
learn
the
cause
of
mildred
sudden
exit
why
jim
foote
is
that
you
she
exclaimed
what
on
airth
are
you
a
wantin
with
miss
keith
then
catching
sight
of
the
approaching
crowd
what
goin
on
she
asked
anything
the
matter
mildred
sprang
to
her
side
and
fairly
pushing
her
back
into
the
house
threw
her
arms
about
her
sobbing
oh
i
so
sorry
for
you
so
sorry
do
look
not
yet
he
he
living
but
who
who
a
livin
who
hurt
girl
tell
me
quick
none
mine
sure
my
old
man
oh
what
i
do
what
i
do
the
trampling
of
many
feet
drew
near
her
husband
rushed
in
pale
breathless
trembling
and
at
sight
of
her
burst
out
crying
like
a
child
then
the
wounded
man
was
supported
into
the
house
men
and
boys
and
even
women
and
girls
crowding
in
after
till
in
a
moment
the
room
was
full
rhoda
jane
and
the
younger
brothers
and
sisters
were
there
screaming
and
crying
gotobed
was
silent
bearing
his
agony
with
the
heroism
of
a
soldier
but
as
his
mother
caught
sight
of
his
ghastly
face
his
mangled
hands
the
blood
upon
his
person
and
the
surgeon
with
his
instruments
she
uttered
a
wild
shriek
and
fell
back
fainting
her
husband
carried
her
into
the
kitchen
and
some
of
the
neighbor
women
gathered
round
with
restoratives
and
whispered
words
of
pity
and
condolence
while
others
hurried
back
and
forth
in
quest
of
such
articles
as
the
surgeon
called
for
rhoda
jane
rushed
out
of
the
kitchen
door
and
ran
to
the
foot
of
the
garden
screaming
and
wringing
her
hands
the
younger
ones
following
her
mildred
could
not
go
away
and
leave
the
family
in
their
dire
distress
she
caught
gotobed
eye
and
there
was
in
it
a
dumb
entreaty
which
she
had
neither
power
nor
heart
to
resist
silently
she
made
her
way
to
his
side
the
doctors
were
clearing
the
room
of
all
who
were
not
needed
they
a
goin
to
take
off
my
right
hand
he
said
hoarsely
it
an
awful
thing
but
if
if
you
stand
by
me
and
let
me
look
in
your
eyes
i
can
bear
it
she
turned
hers
on
the
surgeon
lucilla
grange
father
may
i
if
you
have
the
nerve
my
dear
child
it
would
be
a
great
kindness
to
the
poor
fellow
there
ought
to
be
a
woman
near
him
and
it
seems
neither
mother
nor
sister
is
equal
to
it
i
will
stay
she
said
a
great
compassion
filling
her
heart
i
shall
not
look
at
what
you
are
doing
but
i
will
stand
by
and
fan
him
she
kept
her
word
forgetting
herself
entirely
thinking
of
him
only
as
one
suffering
terrible
agony
and
in
need
of
her
support
she
stood
gazing
into
his
eyes
her
heart
going
up
in
silent
fervent
prayer
on
his
behalf
chloroform
and
ether
were
not
known
in
those
days
and
the
knife
cruel
work
must
be
borne
without
the
blessed
insensibility
to
pain
that
they
can
give
had
the
magnetism
of
mildred
gaze
a
like
effect
i
know
not
but
something
enabled
gotobed
to
pass
through
the
terrible
ordeal
without
a
groan
or
moan
almost
without
flinching
the
right
hand
had
to
be
taken
off
at
the
wrist
the
left
though
much
mangled
the
surgeon
hoped
to
save
and
did
so
ultimately
the
amputation
and
the
dressing
of
the
wounds
was
over
at
last
and
mildred
was
turning
away
when
a
cup
of
tea
was
put
into
her
hand
with
the
words
spoken
in
a
half
whisper
give
him
this
he
will
take
it
from
you
she
held
it
to
his
lips
and
he
drank
a
plate
was
silently
substituted
for
the
cup
and
she
fed
him
like
a
child
poor
fellow
it
would
be
long
before
he
could
feed
himself
again
mildred
set
down
the
plate
and
stole
quickly
from
the
house
her
long
pent
up
emotion
must
find
vent
she
went
weeping
home
her
heart
breaking
with
pity
for
the
man
she
could
not
love
could
not
have
married
for
the
wealth
of
the
world
oh
why
did
he
love
her
so
she
had
read
it
in
his
eyes
that
she
was
more
to
him
than
all
the
world
beside
and
that
he
knew
his
was
a
hopeless
passion
she
was
glad
to
see
that
the
sun
was
setting
because
she
knew
from
the
lateness
of
the
hour
that
tea
must
be
over
at
home
and
the
little
ones
in
bed
for
she
dreaded
their
questionings
and
curious
looks
and
loathed
the
thought
of
food
her
mother
that
best
earthly
friend
who
always
understood
her
as
by
intuition
met
her
at
the
door
and
clasped
her
in
a
tender
loving
embrace
and
on
that
dear
bosom
the
whole
sad
story
was
sobbed
out
poor
poor
fellow
my
heart
aches
for
him
keith
said
mingling
her
tears
with
mildred
and
my
dear
child
i
am
very
glad
you
had
the
courage
and
firmness
to
give
him
the
help
you
did
i
pity
him
too
for
his
unfortunate
attachment
at
the
same
time
that
i
of
course
could
never
never
be
willing
to
see
it
returned
but
your
courage
surprises
me
i
doubt
if
i
should
be
capable
of
the
like
myself
she
added
smiling
through
her
tears
i
know
you
would
mother
dear
returned
the
girl
gazing
with
loving
admiration
into
her
mother
eyes
for
you
are
far
braver
and
firmer
than
i
should
not
have
expected
to
be
able
to
do
it
myself
but
we
never
know
what
we
can
do
till
we
are
tried
i
am
sure
our
father
helped
me
in
answer
to
prayer
and
according
to
his
gracious
promise
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
be
she
added
in
subdued
tremulous
tones
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
keith
for
sufficiency
is
of
god
throughout
the
whole
town
great
sympathy
was
felt
for
the
wounded
young
man
people
showed
it
in
various
ways
by
inquiries
made
of
the
doctor
or
at
the
door
by
calling
in
for
a
little
friendly
chat
and
sending
delicacies
to
tempt
his
appetite
which
for
a
time
failed
under
the
pressure
of
pain
enforced
idleness
a
great
change
for
one
who
had
been
all
his
life
a
hard
worker
and
depression
of
spirits
for
there
were
seasons
when
he
was
overwhelmed
at
the
thought
of
his
maimed
and
helpless
condition
keith
went
frequently
to
see
and
comfort
him
and
his
distressed
mother
and
was
more
successful
in
so
doing
than
almost
any
one
else
except
mildred
who
occasionally
accompanied
her
they
carried
to
gotobed
food
for
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
books
which
they
read
to
him
as
he
could
not
hold
them
himself
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
little
time
or
ability
to
entertain
him
in
that
way
also
they
said
many
a
kind
encouraging
word
concerning
the
possibilities
of
future
usefulness
yet
remaining
to
him
i
shall
never
be
good
for
nothing
no
more
he
sighed
mournfully
one
day
looking
down
at
his
maimed
arm
and
wounded
hand
can
never
swing
my
hammer
or
shoe
a
horse
again
i
have
to
be
a
helpless
burden
on
other
folks
o
takin
care
o
father
and
mother
when
they
git
old
as
i
used
to
think
i
should
i
do
know
that
gotobed
keith
answered
cheerily
i
think
god
has
given
you
a
good
mind
and
that
you
will
gradually
learn
to
do
a
great
deal
with
that
left
hand
write
hold
a
book
and
turn
the
leaves
and
so
be
able
to
educate
yourself
for
usefulness
in
some
new
line
perhaps
do
more
for
your
parents
and
friends
than
you
ever
could
have
done
with
your
hammer
a
light
broke
over
his
face
at
her
words
oh
he
said
drawing
a
long
breath
if
i
thought
that
i
could
bear
it
i
think
you
are
bearing
it
bravely
she
said
i
tryin
my
best
he
sighed
but
the
lord
only
knows
how
hard
it
is
when
folks
comes
and
tells
you
it
a
judgment
sent
onto
you
for
your
sins
and
who
dares
to
tell
you
that
she
cried
flushing
with
indignation
who
could
be
so
heartlessly
cruel
well
damaris
was
in
day
she
means
well
enough
i
guess
she
fetched
something
she
cooked
up
for
me
but
she
do
seem
to
understand
a
feller
critter
feelin
she
give
me
a
long
lecture
said
i
been
dreadful
proud
o
my
strength
and
what
a
neat
job
i
could
make
o
shoein
a
horse
and
the
like
and
so
that
the
lord
took
away
my
hand
to
punish
me
and
fetch
me
down
do
you
think
was
that
way
keith
i
was
thinkin
was
my
own
carelessness
and
not
to
be
blamed
on
him
at
all
it
strikes
me
that
you
are
very
nearly
right
there
she
replied
half
smiling
at
the
earnest
simplicity
with
which
he
spoke
he
is
very
merciful
and
gracious
full
of
tender
pity
and
compassion
for
the
creatures
he
has
made
especially
those
who
are
peculiarly
his
own
because
they
have
accepted
of
the
salvation
offered
through
christ
jesus
yet
he
does
not
always
see
fit
to
save
them
from
the
consequences
as
regards
this
life
of
their
own
follies
and
sins
carelessness
is
a
sin
he
said
with
a
heavy
sigh
i
did
use
to
think
so
but
it
plain
enough
to
me
now
and
do
you
think
mis
keith
he
feels
kind
o
sorry
for
me
even
though
was
my
own
fault
i
am
sure
of
it
and
that
he
will
give
you
strength
to
bear
your
trouble
if
you
will
ask
him
to
bear
it
bravely
and
not
let
it
spoil
your
life
by
robbing
you
of
cheerfulness
and
hope
and
the
usefulness
you
may
attain
to
by
a
determined
manly
struggle
with
your
difficulties
there
is
a
pleasure
in
overcoming
difficulties
she
added
with
a
bright
winning
smile
that
was
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
to
his
saddened
heart
a
pleasure
that
the
slothful
know
nothing
of
i
try
it
he
said
with
determination
god
helping
me
i
will
bless
you
mis
keith
fur
them
words
i
not
forget
illustration
illustration
chapter
the
sad
vicissitudes
of
things
sterne
my
poor
dear
friend
would
that
i
could
comfort
you
keith
said
in
tones
of
deep
heartfelt
sympathy
folding
her
arms
about
chetwood
and
weeping
with
her
but
only
jesus
can
do
that
in
such
sorrow
as
yours
and
he
does
else
i
should
die
for
oh
my
arms
are
so
empty
my
heart
and
home
so
desolate
sobbed
the
bereaved
mother
i
know
it
i
know
it
by
sad
experience
for
i
too
have
wept
over
the
grave
of
a
darling
little
one
you
chetwood
said
with
a
look
of
surprise
you
have
so
many
yes
but
then
i
had
not
all
i
have
now
eva
was
between
rupert
and
zillah
and
would
be
thirteen
now
she
was
five
when
god
took
her
to
himself
ah
you
do
know
how
to
feel
for
me
yes
and
let
me
tell
you
how
i
was
comforted
i
fear
i
was
not
quite
submissive
at
first
but
a
dear
old
mother
in
israel
who
had
several
times
passed
through
the
same
deep
waters
came
to
me
and
said
dear
the
lord
gave
you
quite
a
little
flock
and
when
he
comes
and
asks
you
to
return
him
one
and
you
know
he
will
keep
it
so
safely
in
his
kind
arms
and
on
his
tender
bosom
will
you
refuse
can
you
not
spare
him
one
then
my
heart
was
almost
broken
to
think
i
had
been
so
churlish
toward
my
beloved
master
and
i
resigned
her
cheerfully
into
his
care
and
by
and
by
grew
happy
in
thinking
of
her
so
safe
from
all
sin
and
sorrow
and
pain
so
full
of
joy
at
his
right
hand
and
of
the
time
when
my
work
shall
be
done
and
i
shall
go
to
her
chetwood
thought
for
a
moment
then
turning
to
her
friend
with
eyes
brimful
of
tears
thank
you
she
said
your
words
have
done
me
good
surely
i
too
can
spare
him
one
had
he
taken
all
what
right
could
i
have
to
complain
and
oh
how
sweet
is
the
thought
that
he
is
caring
so
tenderly
for
my
precious
lambkin
the
mothers
mingled
their
tears
again
for
a
little
tears
of
blended
grief
and
joy
then
chetwood
said
what
else
dear
friend
i
seem
to
read
in
your
eyes
that
you
have
something
more
to
say
to
me
only
this
suggested
to
me
by
the
same
old
christian
soldier
and
confirmed
by
my
own
experience
that
efforts
to
comfort
others
react
upon
ourselves
so
proving
the
best
panacea
for
our
own
sorrow
i
believe
it
am
that
i
have
been
so
selfishly
wrapped
up
in
my
own
grief
and
shall
set
about
the
work
at
once
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
suggest
where
i
shall
begin
keith
spoke
of
gotobed
and
the
sort
of
comfort
and
assistance
of
which
he
stood
in
need
chetwood
shuddered
poor
poor
fellow
she
said
my
heart
aches
for
him
i
feel
sick
at
the
very
thought
of
seeing
any
one
in
that
mutilated
condition
but
i
will
go
to
him
and
do
what
i
can
for
his
comfort
and
relief
thank
you
returned
keith
heartily
and
speak
comfortingly
to
the
poor
mother
she
is
grieving
very
much
for
him
and
does
not
look
well
one
of
the
little
girls
too
is
quite
ill
with
intermittent
fever
it
was
well
that
keith
had
engaged
her
friend
to
take
up
the
labor
of
love
for
it
was
long
before
she
herself
could
resume
it
on
reaching
home
she
found
mildred
sitting
with
annis
in
her
arms
the
little
creature
moaning
with
pain
and
in
a
high
fever
mother
she
is
very
sick
whispered
mildred
tremulously
her
eyes
full
of
tears
for
she
was
thinking
of
how
suddenly
mary
chetwood
had
been
snatched
away
by
the
grim
destroyer
death
i
fear
she
is
poor
darling
poor
little
pet
the
mother
said
bending
over
her
and
softly
pressing
her
lips
to
the
burning
cheek
o
mother
mother
if
we
should
lose
her
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
make
her
well
asking
god
blessing
on
our
efforts
keith
answered
with
determined
cheerfulness
though
a
sharp
pang
shot
through
her
heart
at
the
bare
suggestion
grange
was
sent
for
at
once
he
pronounced
the
child
very
ill
but
by
no
means
hopelessly
so
the
sickly
season
he
remarked
is
setting
in
unusually
early
and
with
uncommon
severity
both
in
town
and
country
people
are
taken
down
with
the
fever
every
day
but
it
is
what
i
have
been
expecting
as
the
result
of
the
long
heavy
rains
we
had
all
through
the
spring
succeeded
by
this
intensely
hot
dry
weather
why
we
have
had
a
drop
of
rain
now
scarcely
a
cloud
for
three
weeks
the
heavens
above
us
are
as
brass
and
the
marshes
and
pools
of
stagnant
water
on
every
side
are
teeming
with
miasma
keep
the
children
and
yourselves
out
of
the
sun
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
do
not
on
any
account
allow
them
to
be
exposed
to
the
night
air
and
dew
thank
you
for
your
suggestions
said
keith
we
will
do
our
best
to
follow
them
he
had
just
come
home
from
his
office
for
it
was
near
the
children
too
had
come
in
from
their
work
or
play
and
the
whole
family
were
gathered
in
the
where
the
baby
girl
lay
in
her
cradle
mother
and
sister
hanging
over
her
in
tender
solicitude
fan
had
climbed
her
father
knee
and
was
lying
very
quiet
in
his
arms
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
the
doctor
taking
his
hat
to
go
paused
as
his
eye
fell
on
her
and
stepping
quickly
to
her
side
took
her
hand
in
his
this
child
is
sick
too
he
said
and
went
on
to
question
and
prescribe
for
her
directing
that
she
should
be
put
to
bed
at
once
oh
sighed
mildred
if
we
only
had
aunt
wealthy
here
i
wish
you
had
the
doctor
said
but
the
neighbors
here
are
always
very
kind
in
times
of
sickness
yes
we
have
had
experience
of
that
in
the
past
replied
keith
the
doctor
called
on
chetwood
and
mrs
prior
on
his
homeward
way
and
within
an
hour
both
were
at
keith
offering
their
services
in
nursing
or
any
thing
else
that
was
needed
you
are
very
kind
keith
said
but
i
think
we
can
manage
for
a
while
and
that
you
should
save
your
strength
for
those
who
need
it
more
the
little
ones
objected
to
being
waited
upon
by
strangers
and
celestia
ann
insisted
that
she
wanted
no
help
with
her
housework
or
cooking
so
the
ladies
departed
after
exacting
a
promise
that
they
should
be
sent
for
if
needed
that
time
came
soon
before
the
crisis
was
passed
with
annis
and
fan
three
more
of
the
children
zillah
cyril
and
don
were
taken
down
then
the
father
and
oh
what
a
weary
burden
of
care
anxiety
toil
and
grief
fell
upon
the
mother
and
sister
they
had
sore
need
now
of
all
the
faith
patience
and
hope
they
had
garnered
up
in
happier
days
of
all
the
great
and
precious
promises
they
had
learned
to
lean
upon
rupert
was
slowly
dressing
himself
one
august
morning
feeling
weak
and
ill
when
his
mother
pale
sorrowful
face
looked
in
at
his
door
he
tried
to
brighten
up
and
seem
strong
and
well
as
he
turned
to
meet
her
asking
how
are
you
mother
dear
and
the
sick
ones
i
hope
you
all
slept
not
much
she
said
vainly
striving
after
the
accustomed
cheery
tone
annis
and
fan
did
pretty
well
oh
i
am
thankful
that
the
doctor
considers
them
out
of
danger
now
if
we
can
only
give
them
the
good
nursing
they
need
but
poor
cyril
is
quite
delirious
very
very
sick
i
fear
and
zillah
not
much
better
besides
but
here
her
voice
broke
and
for
a
moment
she
was
unable
to
go
on
o
mother
not
another
one
down
he
cried
you
and
mildred
will
be
killed
with
so
much
nursing
rupert
it
is
your
father
now
she
sobbed
he
tries
to
makes
us
believe
it
is
not
much
that
he
sleep
it
off
in
an
hour
or
so
but
oh
i
can
see
that
he
very
sick
my
father
very
sick
he
echoed
aghast
poor
father
and
you
must
lose
his
help
with
the
others
and
have
him
to
nurse
too
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
he
is
suffering
and
perhaps
in
danger
celestia
ann
has
breakfast
nearly
ready
i
want
you
to
eat
at
once
then
go
for
the
doctor
he
did
not
come
last
night
and
call
and
tell
chetwood
and
mrs
prior
what
a
sick
household
we
are
and
that
now
if
they
can
give
me
help
in
nursing
i
shall
be
very
glad
and
thankful
keith
passed
on
into
the
kitchen

on
table
said
celestia
ann

sit
down
and
eat
mis
keith
fur
you

ready
to
drop
i
pour
you
out
a
cup
coffee
and
then
run
in
and

after

sick
till

thank
you
keith
said
though
i
have
no
desire

will

your
offer
for
i
do
feel
faint
and
empty
tell
mildred
to
come
too
as
soon
as
she
can
be
spared
rupert
and
ada
came
in
together
at
that
moment
and
took
their
places
at
the
table
only
three
of
us
this
morning
of
ten
ada
remarked
sadly
well
we
hope
the
others
will
all
be
back
soon
said
rupert
longing
to
comfort
and
cheer
his
mother
his
head
ached
and
chills
were
creeping
down
his
back
but
he
said
nothing
about
it
drank
his
coffee
forced
himself
to
eat
a
little
and
presently
declaring
himself
done
put
on
his
hat
and
hurried
away
on
his
errand
it
was
now
a
fortnight
since
annis
had
been
taken
ill
and
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
yet
the
nights
and
mornings
were
chilly
and
damp
then
the
sun
rose
and
shone
all
day
with
a
fierce
burning
heat
that
scorched
everything
it
touched
and
day
by
day
the
fever
had
found
new
victims
till
every
physician
hands
were
full
to
overflowing
how
chilly
it
is
thought
rupert
as
he
hastened
down
the
path
to
the
gate
but
it
be
hot
enough
presently
he
added
looking
up
at
the
sky
not
a
cloud
to
be
seen
and
the
sun
will
be
glaring
down
on
us
as
fiercely
as
ever
i
think
if
there
is
some
change
soon
we
all
sicken
and
die
he
walked
on
up
the
street
doors
and
windows
were
closed
scarcely
any
one
seemed
astir
they
sleeping
late
he
thought
well
who
can
blame
them
either
sick
themselves
or
worn
out
taking
care
of
the
sick
he
came
first
to
the
hotel
mrs
prior
was
very
busy
getting
breakfast
but
stepped
to
the
door
to
hear
his
message
i
dreadful
sorry
she
said
and
i
call
round

your
mother
just
as
soon
as

more
than
full
here
at
home
i
come
if
i
can
you
may
depend
she
answered
for
i
think
a
sight
of
your
mother
the
boy
sighed
heavily
as
he
turned
and
went
on
his
way
how
much
of
the
brightness
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
life
just
then
grange
house
was
a
few
steps
further
on
an
old
lady
the
mother
answered
his
knock
the
doctor
is
in
bed
and
asleep
just
now
she
said
he
has
had
very
little
rest
for
the
last
three
weeks
was
up
all
night
out
in
the
country
and
came
home
with
a
heavy
chill
and
the
rest
of
the
family
are
all
down
with
the
fever
except
myself
and
little
five
year
old
ellen
what
are
we
coming
to
exclaimed
the
lad
i
do
know
she
answered
but
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
said
rupert
looking
sadly
perplexed
and
anxious
mother
says
my
father
and
cyril
are
both
very
i
will
tell
the
doctor
when
he
wakes
and
perhaps
he
will
be
able
to
go
down
it
would
hardly
be
worth
while
to
send
you
for
another
for
they
all
equally
busy
thank
you
he
said
we
would
not
like
to
have
to
try
another
and
bidding
her
good
morning
he
went
on
his
way
to
the
squire
chetwood
put
on
her
bonnet
at
once
and
went
with
him
claudina
would
come
too
she
said
but
two
of
the
boys
are
sick
and
i
afraid
she
is
taking
the
fever
herself
it
seems
as
if
everybody
is
taking
it
said
rupert
chetwood
is
it
often
so
sickly
here
never
was
known
to
be
quite
so
bad
before
she
answered
they
say
the
oldest
inhabitant
does
remember
such
a
time
do
you
notice
how
quiet
and
empty
the
streets
are
yes
people
seem
to
be
very
late
in
getting
up
the
stores
are
all
shut
up
still
there
no
business
doing
at
all
she
returned
and
people
are
not
up
because
they
ill
too
ill
most
of
them
to
leave
their
beds
there
are
not
many
houses
in
town
where
more
than
one
or
two
are
able
to
crawl
about
to
help
themselves
or
wait
on
the
sick
and
grange
tells
me
it
is
just
as
bad
in
the
country
the
harvest
is
uncommonly
fine
but
there
nobody
to
gather
it
in
there
are
loads
of
wild
berries
ripe
on
the
bushes
but
nobody
able
to
pick
them
emmaretta
lightcap
died
yesterday
i
was
there
last
night
and
helped
to
lay
her
out
all
the
rest
of
the
family
are
in
bed
with
the
fever
except
poor
gotobed
and
his
mother
oh
it
a
sorrowful
time
effie
and
one
or
two
of
the
little
ones
are
sick
at
prescott
and
in
the
next
house
not
one
of
the
family
is
able
to
be
out
of
bed
keith
was
quite
as
ill
as
his
wife
feared
she
devoted
herself
principally
to
him
while
chetwood
and
mildred
together
nursed
the
others
rupert
had
had
a
chill
and
fever
followed
in
due
season
but
he
managed
to
keep
up
and
to
conceal
his
illness
from
all
but
celestia
ann
who
did
the
best
she
could
for
him
mrs
prior
came
in
for
an
hour
in
the
after
noon
and
taking
place
enabled
her
to
lie
down
for
a
little
greatly
needed
rest
and
sleep
chetwood
spent
the
day
and
night
with
them
but
then
went
home
to
return
no
more
her
own
family
being
no
longer
able
to
dispense
with
her
care
and
nursing
zillah
was
slightly
better
that
morning
but
keith
cyril
and
don
were
all
delirious
and
so
evidently
in
danger
that
the
hearts
of
mother
and
sister
were
very
heavy
keith
scarcely
left
her
husband
bed
side
except
occasionally
to
pass
into
the
next
room
and
bend
for
a
moment
over
her
little
boys
to
take
annis
or
fan
in
her
arms
to
caress
and
reluctantly
put
them
down
again
and
to
whisper
a
word
of
hope
and
encouragement
to
mildred
the
other
little
girls
and
rupert
celestia
ann
had
full
sway
in
the
kitchen
and
with
genuine
kindness
of
heart
took
charge
of
the
rest
of
the
house
so
far
as
she
could
and
prepared
delicacies
for
the
sick
she
was
a
great
help
in
looking
after
the
convalescing
had
always
a
cheery
word
ready
for
the
weary
anxious
nurses
and
in
short
proved
herself
invaluable
in
this
great
emergency
what
then
was
their
distress
and
despair
when
they
found
they
must
lose
her
glancing
from
the
window
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
that
which
chetwood
had
spent
with
them
mildred
saw
a
countryman
passing
round
toward
the
kitchen
and
in
a
moment
after
his
voice
and
celestia
ann
could
be
heard
in
earnest
colloquy
the
latter
interrupted
by
heavy
sobs
then
she
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
nursery
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
silently
beckoned
to
mildred
what
is
it
the
latter
asked
going
to
her
why
my
brother
come
to
fetch
me
home
and
i
have
to
go

mildred
sinking
into
a
chair
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
i
can
not
nurse
them
all
properly
and
cook

and
i
dreadful

sighed
celestia
ann
wiping

tears

streaming
over

cheeks

with

tears
celestia

it
was
to
mildred
celestia
ann
parting
words
were
spoken
mildred
sitting
in
dumb
despair
beside
the
bed
where
cyril
and
don
lay
tossing
and
moaning
in
a
burning
fever
her
heart
sank
like
lead
in
her
bosom
as
she
listened
to
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
that
was
bearing
away
her
late
efficient
helper
what
could
they
do
without
her
a
quiet
step
crossed
the
room
a
soft
hand
was
laid
caressingly
on
mildred
bowed
head
and
looking
up
she
saw
her
mother
sweet
pale
face
bending
over
her
a
worn
and
weary
face
but
with
a
strange
peacefulness
shining
through
its
care
and
sorrow
o
mother
mother
whatever
shall
we
do
cried
the
girl
in
a
broken
whisper
and
with
a
burst
of
tears
keith
had
a
small
bible
in
her
hand
her
finger
between
the
leaves
she
laid
it
open
before
mildred
pointed
to
a
passage
in
the
psalm
and
just
touching
her
lips
to
her
forehead
turned
away
to
the
little
sufferers
on
the
bed
mother
darlings
mother
poor
little
men

to
be
very
patient
and
good
like

soon
be

again
she
is
asking

make
you
well

uttered
some
incoherent
words
showing
that
his
mind
wandered

the
baby
voice

from

fan
and

we
asked
him

about

joined
in
fan
and
zillah
patiently
she
went
over
and
kissed
all
three
calling
them
dear
good
children
then
passed
on
into
the
kitchen
rupert
was
there
trying
to
make
a
custard
ada
washing
dishes
you
see
you
not
entirely
without
help
in
this
department
yet
mother
the
lad
said
laughingly
no
she
answered
with
a
smile
that
he
felt
was
ample
reward
for
his
efforts
how
are
you
succeeding
bravely
at
least
it
looks
nice
please
come
and
tell
me
if
is
ready
to
be
taken
off
it
will
be
in
a
moment
run
out
and
get
me
a
handful
of
leaves
from
that
young
peach
tree
to
flavor
it
with
he
obeyed
she
stirring
the
custard
and
commending
ada
industry
while
he
was
gone
here
they
are
mother
is
this
enough
he
asked
coming
back
quite
she
said
taking
them
from
him
then
as
her
hand
touched
his
rupert
she
cried
with
anguish
in
her
tones
you
are
sick
burning
up
with
fever
heated
over
the
stove
mother
he
said
trying
to
laugh
it
off
as
he
lifted
the
kettle
from
the
fire
and
poured
its
contents
into
a
bowl
no
i
am
not
to
be
deceived
she
answered
in
a
choking
voice
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
now
he
shook
his
head
somebody
must
keep
up
several
somebodies
to
take
anything
like
proper
care
of
the
sick
ones
and
mother
i
as
able
as
you
are
you
look
dreadfully
worn
and
she
was
all
that
she
felt
the
chills
creeping
over
her
at
that
moment
and
her
head
seemed
ready
to
burst
her
heart
also
oh
she
had
need
of
all
the
comfort
and
support
of
the
words
she
had
pointed
out
to
mildred
and
of
the
exhortation
contained
therein
my
soul
wait
thou
only
upon
god
for
my
expectation
is
from
him
he
only
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation
he
is
my
defense
i
shall
not
be
moved
in
god
is
my
salvation
and
my
glory
the
rock
of
my
strength
and
my
refuge
is
in
god
she
whispered
them
to
herself
as
with
clasped
hands
and
closed
eyes
she
sank
heavily
into
a
chair
half
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
rupert
sprang
to
her
side
thinking
she
was
about
to
faint
and
ada
with
the
same
thought
in
her
mind
set
down
the
plate
she
was
wiping
and
hurried
to
her
also
they
caught
the
last
words
rock
of
my
strength
and
my
refuge
is
in
god
yes
mother
dear
sobbed
the
lad
putting
his
arms
around
her
and
oh
you
know
it
a
refuge
that
will
never
fail
will
we
not
fear
though
the
earth
be
removed
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
extremity
is
god
opportunity
and
he
will
help
us
through
this
strait
somehow
yes
she
whispered
and
though
it
should
be
by
death
what
is
that
but
going
home
to
those
of
us
who
love
the
lord
and
trust
in
his
imputed
righteousness
she
added
looking
earnestly
questioningly
into
his
face
mother
i
believe
i
do
he
said
though
i
have
never
told
you
so
before
now
i
can
bear
it
she
whispered
closing
her
eyes
again
while
a
sweet
smile
played
about
her
lips
her
head
dropped
heavily
on
her
son
shoulder
oh
shrieked
ada
she
dying
mother
dying
hush
cried
rupert
sternly
thinking
of
the
mischief
her
cry
might
work
should
it
reach
the
ears
of
the
sick
ones
she
has
only
fainted
a
tumbler
of
water
quick
quick
ada
as
the
terrified
child
hastened
to
do
his
bidding
mildred
came
flying
from
the
inner
room
her
face
pale
her
whole
frame
trembling
with
affright
mother
the
word
came
in
tones
of
agony
from
her
pale
quivering
lips
it
only
a
faint
said
rupert
hoarsely
help
me
to
lay
her
down
and
loosen
her
clothes
and
have
you
hartshorn
or
something
whatever
there
is
yes
ada
quick
quick
the
bottle
of
smelling
salts
it
on
the
stand
by
father
bedside
o
mother
mother
you
too
what
to
become
of
us
o
rupert
she
just
killed
with
nursing
and
i
could
help
it
of
course
you
could
you
are
nearly
killed
yourself
he
said
his
tears
falling
almost
as
fast
as
hers
while
between
them
they
half
carried
half
dragged
the
insensible
form
into
the
adjoining
room
and
laid
it
tenderly
down
upon
a
lounge
poor
children
so
utterly
overwhelmed
were
they
by
their
helpless
condition
superadded
to
all
the
other
causes
for
anxiety
perplexity
and
distress
so
taken
up
with
efforts
for
her
restoration
to
consciousness
that
they
scarcely
heard
the
cries
of
the
sick
little
ones
who
could
not
understand
why
they
were
thus
left
alone
or
the
calls
of
their
father
who
had
roused
from
sleep
and
missed
his
gentle
nurse
nor
did
they
notice
who
it
was
that
came
in
through
the
open
kitchen
door
and
silently
assisted
them
raising
the
window
blind
and
sprinkling
water
on
the
still
white
face
at
last
keith
eyes
unclosed
and
she
started
up
asking
faintly
what
is
it
have
i
been
ill
then
fell
back
again
completely
exhausted
you
were
faint
mother
dear
said
mildred
vainly
striving
to
steady
her
voice
but
lie
still
for
a
while
and
i
hope
you
will
get
over
it
you
have
been
doing
too
much
and
must
rest
now
rest
child
how
can
i
there
is
your
father
calling
me
and
the
children
are
crying
she
started
up
again
but
with
the
same
result
as
before
my
poor
sick
husband
my
little
ailing
children
what
is
to
become
of
you
she
sighed
tears
stealing
from
beneath
the
closed
eyelids
and
trickling
down
the
pale
cheeks
mother
i
will
do
my
best
sobbed
mildred
only
lie
and
rest
yourself
and
i
am
here
to
assist
and
able
to
do
it
said
a
somewhat
harsh
discordant
voice
though
there
was
in
it
a
tone
of
kindness
too
then
they
looked
up
and
saw
standing
near
the
stiff
angular
figure
of
damaris
drybread
you
mildred
exclaimed
in
utter
surprise
yes
i
miss
keith
did
you
think
there
was
none
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
me
my
school
broke
up
by
this
pestilence
and
only
one
of
our
family
has
took
the
fever
yet
so
when
i
heard
that
you
were
nearly
all
down
sick
here
and
your
girl
had
gone
off
and
left
you
i
said
to
myself
a
duty
for
you
there
damaris
drybread
go
right
away
and
do
it
and
i
came
and
it
was
very
very
kind
in
you
mildred
said
extending
her
hand
i
have
hardly
deserved
it
from
you
for
i
judged
you
harshly
well
i
should
wonder
if
i
done
the
same
to
you
damaris
answered
coldly
taking
the
offered
hand
only
to
drop
it
again
instantly
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
and
i
do
ask
no
thanks
i
only
tryin
to
be
a
good
samaritan
to
you
because
we
told
and
do
thou
likewise
the
cries
of
the
children
had
become
so
piteous
and
importunate
that
mildred
rushed
away
to
attend
to
them
her
father
calls
had
ceased
and
as
the
little
ones
quieted
down
she
could
hear
a
manly
voice
speaking
to
him
in
gentle
soothing
tones
it
is
the
doctor
she
thought
with
an
emotion
somewhat
akin
to
pleasure
he
was
so
sorely
needed
and
had
not
called
since
the
previous
night
but
on
going
in
she
found
lord
by
the
bedside
he
turned
showing
a
face
full
of
sympathy
and
concern
and
held
out
his
hand
this
is
kind
she
said
putting
hers
into
it
my
poor
child
he
responded
feelingly
raising
the
hand
to
his
lips
in
his
absent
way
my
heart
aches
for
you
and
there
are
many
others
in
like
affliction
many
others
all
round
the
country
people
are
sick
dying
many
of
them
simply
for
lack
of
suitable
nourishment
the
tears
rolled
down
his
manly
cheeks
as
he
spoke
and
the
sight
of
them
did
not
lower
him
in
the
girl
esteem
and
what
can
i
do
he
went
on
i
know
nothing
of
cooking
i
can
only
carry
them
crackers
to
sustain
their
poor
bodies
and
try
to
feed
their
souls
with
the
bread
of
life
i
feel
for
them
all
but
for
you
o
mildred
dear
girl
what
can
i
do
to
help
and
comfort
you
in
this
extremity
we
have
need
of
nurses
mother
but
with
that
word
she
broke
into
uncontrollable
weeping
suppressed
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
father
who
had
fallen
into
a
doze
but
shaking
her
whole
frame
with
its
violence
it
distressed
her
listener
he
made
a
step
toward
her
a
gesture
as
if
he
would
fold
her
in
his
arms
but
drew
hastily
back
blushing
and
confused
as
the
door
opened
and
grange
came
in
illustration
chapter
all
love
is
sweet
given
or
returned
common
as
light
is
love
and
its
familiar
voice
wearies
not
ever
shelley
ah
good
morning
my
dear
child
good
morning
sir
the
doctor
said
in
an
undertone
giving
his
hand
to
mildred
and
the
minister
in
turn
then
with
an
anxious
glance
at
the
bed
how
is
he
sleeping
now
i
see
how
did
he
rest
through
the
night
not
very
well
and
your
mother
where
is
she
not
down
too
with
almost
a
groan
as
he
read
the
truth
in
the
young
girl
face
mildred
led
him
to
her
she
lay
on
the
lounge
still
with
closed
eyes
and
face
of
deathly
pallor
her
cheek
resting
against
the
dark
curls
of
rupert
who
had
thrown
himself
on
the
floor
by
her
side
and
laid
his
head
on
the
same
pillow
while
he
held
one
of
her
hands
caressing
it
tenderly
his
cheeks
were
burning
his
eyes
sparkling
with
fever
the
doctor
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
ought
to
be
in
bed
both
of
you
go
my
boy
at
once
you
are
not
fit
to
be
here
i
ca
sir
indeed
i
needed
to
take
care
of
the
others
you
will
help
most
by
giving
up
at
once
said
the
doctor
otherwise
you
will
make
yourself
so
sick
as
to
need
a
great
deal
of
attention
yes
go
my
dear
boy
whispered
keith
i
will
since
you
bid
me
darling
mother
he
answered
pressing
his
hot
lips
to
her
cheek
then
tottering
from
the
room
she
looked
after
him
with
sad
pitying
eyes
so
sick
and
your
mother
not
able
to
nurse
you
mildred
my
poor
dear
child
how
are
you
to
stand
it
she
sighed
turning
them
upon
her
daughter
face
as
she
bent
over
her
try
not
to
be
troubled
and
anxious
my
dear
madam
said
the
doctor
the
more
quiet
and
free
from
care
you
can
keep
your
mind
the
better
for
you
trust
the
lord
that
all
will
come
out
right
i
will
he
is
all
my
hope
and
trust
for
myself
and
for
my
dear
ones
she
answered
with
almost
her
accustomed
cheerfulness
things
look
very
dark
but
the
lord
hand
is
not
shortened
that
it
can
not
save
neither
his
ear
heavy
that
it
can
not
hear
and
he
has
sent
us
some
help
already
observed
mildred
from
a
most
unexpected
quarter
damaris
came
in
at
that
moment
from
the
kitchen
saluted
the
doctor
in
her
usual
formal
way
and
turning
to
keith
remarked
i
hope
you
not
going
to
be
very
sick
but
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
for
anyhow
do
you
say
so
doctor
i
do
most
emphatically
answered
the
physician
who
had
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
was
busied
in
measuring
out
medicines
and
i
very
glad
miss
damaris
to
see
you
here
it
appeared
to
be
my
duty
to
come
she
said
looking
not
i
no
great
nurse
but
i
can
do
housework
and
cook
for
sick
or
well
and
them
things
is
as
necessary
as
the
nursing
certainly
said
grange
and
went
on
to
give
directions
to
her
concerning
the
proper
food
for
his
patients
and
to
mildred
in
regard
to
the
administering
of
medicines
and
other
remedies
he
made
his
round
among
them
pronounced
zillah
much
better
keith
slightly
so
he
was
silent
as
to
the
little
boys
and
mildred
heart
was
full
of
anguish
as
she
perceived
from
his
countenance
or
thought
she
did
that
their
recovery
was
still
very
doubtful
lord
had
remained
at
keith
bedside
while
the
doctor
and
mildred
were
absent
from
the
room
and
was
still
there
when
they
returned
he
looked
perplexed
and
ill
at
ease
i
have
no
skill
in
nursing
he
said
never
have
had
any
experience
am
in
fact
a
very
unsuitable
person
for
the
task
being
very
absent
minded
as
you
both
know
but
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
i
miss
mildred
i
can
sit
here
and
hand
anything
he
asks
for
call
you
if
he
needs
your
assistance
and
give
the
medicines
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
remind
me
when
it
is
time
to
do
so
the
offer
was
gladly
accepted
and
the
new
nurse
entered
upon
his
duties
immediately
yet
even
with
these
new
and
unexpected
helps
it
was
clearly
impossible
for
the
weary
girl
to
give
proper
attention
to
five
very
sick
persons
and
two
who
were
barely
convalescent
her
heart
was
overwhelmed
the
burden
heavier
than
she
could
bear
but
blessed
be
god
the
god
of
israel
his
people
need
not
bear
their
griefs
and
anxieties
alone
he
bids
them
not
cast
thy
burden
upon
the
lord
and
he
shall
sustain
thee
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
these
and
other
like
great
and
precious
promises
were
brought
home
with
power
and
sweetness
to
mildred
mind
in
this
time
of
deep
distress
and
anguish
and
kept
her
from
sinking
beneath
the
load
o
lord
of
hosts
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
thee
for
thou
lord
wilt
bless
the
righteous
with
favor
wilt
thou
compass
him
as
with
a
shield
there
seemed
no
earthly
friend
left
to
come
to
mildred
aid
she
could
think
of
none
claudina
chetwood
and
lucilla
grange
were
both
themselves
lying
upon
sick
beds
so
were
all
her
lady
acquaintances
in
pleasant
plains
except
such
as
like
herself
had
their
hands
more
than
full
with
the
care
of
the
sick
in
their
own
families
and
aunt
wealthy
was
so
far
far
away
that
before
a
message
could
reach
her
they
might
all
be
in
their
graves
how
long
it
seemed
since
she
went
away
how
long
since
the
beginning
of
this
dreadful
sickly
season
that
had
as
it
were
shut
her
mildred
away
from
all
pleasant
social
intercourse
with
her
young
companions
into
her
own
little
world
of
trial
and
trouble
it
was
a
comfort
that
some
one
was
attending
to
domestic
affairs
some
one
sitting
with
her
sick
father
and
rupert
who
now
shared
his
bed
but
ah
she
could
not
more
than
half
attend
to
the
pressing
needs
of
the
others
the
day
was
intensely
hot
scarce
a
breath
of
air
stirring
though
every
door
and
window
stood
wide
open
the
little
boys
feverish
and
restless
wanted
to
be
fanned
every
moment
and
called
almost
incessantly
for
cold
fresh
water
the
others
craved
it
too
and
it
could
be
had
only
from
the
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
river
bank
and
ice
being
an
unknown
luxury
in
pleasant
plains
at
that
period
it
could
not
be
kept
cool
for
any
length
of
time
she
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
call
upon
either
miss
drybread
or
lord
for
this
service
and
as
the
one
judged
it
unnecessary
that
the
water
should
be
brought
frequently
and
the
other
was
too
to
think
of
offering
to
bring
it
and
she
could
not
leave
her
charges
to
go
herself
even
if
her
strength
had
been
equal
to
the
effort
in
addition
to
all
the
other
demands
upon
it
she
could
but
endure
the
pain
of
seeing
the
loved
ones
suffer
from
thirst
water
water
cold
water
milly
sobbed
little
don
this
is
cold
water
dear
she
said
holding
a
cup
to
his
lips
no
is
right
cold
he
fretted
pushing
it
away
it
does
taste
good
oh
send
somebody
to
bring
cold
water
she
set
down
the
cup
and
burst
into
tears
absorbed
in
her
grief
and
distress
she
did
not
hear
the
gate
gently
opened
and
shut
again
or
a
step
coming
up
the
path
across
the
porch
through
the
hall
and
into
the
room
where
she
sat
weeping
such
bitter
tears
as
she
had
never
wept
before
but
it
was
a
cautious
tread
as
of
one
who
feared
to
disturb
the
sick
as
was
the
fact
with
that
fear
before
his
eyes
wallace
ormsby
had
taken
thought
even
to
come
in
slippered
feet
he
should
have
paused
at
the
room
door
till
invited
to
enter
but
forgot
everything
else
at
sight
of
mildred
distress
and
never
stopped
till
he
was
close
at
her
side
o
mildred
dear
mildred
what
is
it
what
can
i
do
to
help
and
comfort
you
he
said
in
tones
tremulous
with
love
and
pity
as
he
bent
over
her
and
took
her
hand
in
his
she
started
with
surprise
but
the
hand
was
not
withdrawn
and
the
lips
and
eyes
smiled
faintly
through
the
rain
of
tears
as
she
looked
up
into
his
noble
face
and
read
there
ardent
affection
and
deep
sympathy
in
her
sorrow
surely
you
will
let
me
help
you
in
this
dreadful
time
when
there
no
more
proper
person
to
do
it
he
said
with
earnest
entreaty
why
should
we
care
for
conventionalities
now
you
are
weak
and
worn
out
in
sore
need
of
assistance
i
am
well
and
strong
able
and
more
than
willing
to
give
it
say
may
i
not
stay
here
by
your
side
and
help
with
this
nursing
water
cold
water
sobbed
don
oh
go
get
cold
water
for
me
and
cyril
yes
wallace
ormsby
mildred
said
the
tears
coursing
down
her
cheeks
i
can
not
sacrifice
them
to
conventionalities
and
so
gladly
accept
your
kind
offer
of
help
oh
do
talk
go
get
water
quick
fretted
don
i
ca
wait
milly
what
makes
you
so
naughty
to
me
wallace
seized
a
pitcher
standing
near
and
hastened
to
the
spring
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
premises
and
knew
the
way
for
the
next
fortnight
he
had
what
he
considered
the
blessed
privilege
of
sharing
mildred
burdens
griefs
and
cares
watching
with
her
over
each
of
those
dear
ones
as
they
passed
through
the
crisis
of
the
disease
and
the
first
stages
of
the
after
convalescence
for
they
all
recovered
a
fact
which
the
parents
and
older
children
recognized
with
deep
gratitude
to
him
to
whom
belong
the
issues
from
death
nor
did
they
forget
the
thanks
due
their
earthly
helpers
and
friends
the
minister
held
a
warmer
place
than
before
in
the
hearts
of
these
parishioners
and
damaris
drybread
received
a
substantial
reward
for
her
services
which
as
she
was
dependent
upon
her
own
exertions
for
a
livelihood
was
not
declined
that
fearful
sickly
season
passed
away
but
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
by
the
survivors
and
comparative
health
and
prosperity
again
dawned
upon
the
town
and
surrounding
country
the
keiths
returned
to
their
old
busy
cheerful
life
and
wallace
ormsby
beloved
by
the
whole
family
seemed
as
one
of
them
years
of
ordinary
social
intercourse
could
not
have
brought
him
into
so
close
an
intimacy
with
them
and
especially
with
mildred
as
those
two
weeks
in
which
they
two
shared
the
toils
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
those
who
watch
by
beds
of
sickness
that
may
end
in
death
they
had
learned
to
know
each
other
faults
and
weaknesses
strong
points
and
virtues
and
with
the
knowledge
their
mutual
esteem
and
admiration
had
but
increased
they
had
been
warm
friends
before
now
they
were
not
plighted
lovers
ormsby
had
not
spoken
yet
but
to
his
eye
there
was
but
one
beloved
face
on
earth
and
that
was
shining
on
him
