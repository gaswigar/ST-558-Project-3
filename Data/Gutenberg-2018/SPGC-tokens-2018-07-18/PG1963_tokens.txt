the
confession
by
mary
roberts
rinehart
i
i
am
not
a
susceptible
woman
i
am
objective
rather
than
subjective
and
a
fairly
full
experience
of
life
has
taught
me
that
most
of
my
impressions
are
from
within
out
rather
than
the
other
way
about
for
instance
obsession
at
one
time
a
few
years
ago
of
a
shadowy
figure
on
my
right
just
beyond
the
field
of
vision
was
later
exposed
as
the
result
of
a
defect
in
my
glasses
in
the
same
way
maggie
my
old
servant
was
during
one
entire
summer
haunted
by
and
considered
it
a
personal
summons
to
eternity
until
it
was
shown
to
be
in
her
inner
ear
yet
the
benton
house
undeniably
made
me
uncomfortable
perhaps
it
was
because
it
had
remained
unchanged
for
so
long
the
old
horsehair
chairs
with
their
shiny
mahogany
frames
showed
by
the
slightly
worn
places
in
the
carpet
before
them
that
they
had
not
deviated
an
inch
from
their
position
for
many
years
the
carpets
carpets
that
reached
to
the
very
baseboards
and
gave
under
one
feet
with
the
yielding
of
heavy
padding
beneath
were
bright
under
beds
and
wardrobes
while
in
the
centers
of
the
rooms
they
had
faded
into
the
softness
of
old
tapestry
maggie
i
remember
on
our
arrival
moved
a
chair
from
the
wall
in
the
library
and
immediately
put
it
back
again
with
a
glance
to
see
if
i
had
observed
her
it
nice
and
clean
miss
agnes
she
said
a
i
kind
of
feel
that
a
little
dirt
would
make
it
more
homelike
i
sure
i
do
see
why
i
replied
rather
sharply
i
lived
in
a
tolerably
clean
house
most
of
my
life
maggie
however
was
digging
a
heel
into
the
padded
carpet
she
had
chosen
a
sunny
place
for
the
experiment
and
a
small
cloud
of
dust
rose
like
smoke
germs
she
said
just
what
i
expected
we
better
bring
the
vacuum
cleaner
out
from
the
city
miss
agnes
them
carpets
have
been
lifted
for
years
but
i
paid
little
attention
to
her
to
maggie
any
particle
of
matter
not
otherwise
classified
is
a
germ
and
the
prospect
of
finding
dust
in
that
immaculate
house
was
sufficiently
thrilling
to
tide
over
the
strangeness
of
our
first
few
hours
in
it
once
a
year
i
rent
a
house
in
the
country
when
my
nephew
and
niece
were
children
i
did
it
to
take
them
out
of
the
city
during
school
vacations
later
when
they
grew
up
it
was
to
be
near
the
country
club
but
now
with
the
children
married
and
new
families
coming
along
we
were
more
concerned
with
dairies
than
with
clubs
and
i
inquired
more
carefully
about
the
neighborhood
cows
than
about
the
neighborhood
i
had
really
selected
the
house
at
benton
station
because
there
was
a
most
alluring
pasture
with
a
brook
running
through
it
and
violets
over
the
banks
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
cow
with
a
conscience
could
live
in
those
surroundings
and
give
colicky
milk
then
the
house
was
cheap
unbelievably
cheap
i
suspected
sewerage
at
once
but
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
best
possible
order
indeed
new
plumbing
had
been
put
in
and
extra
bathrooms
installed
as
old
miss
emily
benton
lived
there
alone
with
only
an
old
couple
to
look
after
her
it
looked
odd
to
see
three
bathrooms
two
of
them
new
on
the
second
floor
big
tubs
and
showers
although
little
old
miss
emily
could
have
bathed
in
the
washbowl
and
have
had
room
to
spare
i
faced
the
agent
downstairs
in
the
parlor
after
i
had
gone
over
the
house
miss
emily
benton
had
not
appeared
and
i
took
it
she
was
away
why
all
those
bathrooms
i
demanded
does
she
use
them
in
rotation
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
wished
to
rent
the
house
miss
blakiston
the
plumbing
but
she
is
giving
the
house
away
i
exclaimed
those
bathrooms
have
cost
much
more
than
she
will
get
out
of
it
you
and
i
know
that
the
price
is
absurd
he
smiled
at
that
if
you
wish
to
pay
more
you
may
of
course
she
is
a
fine
woman
miss
blakiston
but
you
can
never
measure
a
benton
with
any
but
their
own
the
truth
is
that
she
wants
the
house
off
her
hands
this
summer
i
do
know
why
it
a
good
house
and
she
has
lived
here
all
her
life
but
my
instructions
i
tell
you
frankly
are
to
rent
it
if
i
have
to
give
it
away
with
which
absurd
sentence
we
went
out
the
front
door
and
i
saw
the
pasture
which
decided
me
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
had
taken
the
house
for
my
grandnieces
and
nephews
it
was
annoying
to
find
by
the
end
of
june
that
i
should
have
to
live
in
it
by
myself
willie
boy
was
having
his
teeth
straightened
and
must
make
daily
visits
to
the
dentist
and
jack
went
to
california
and
took
gertrude
and
the
boys
with
him
the
first
curious
thing
happened
then
i
wrote
to
the
agent
saying
that
i
would
not
use
the
house
but
enclosing
a
check
for
its
rental
as
i
had
signed
the
lease
to
my
surprise
i
received
in
reply
a
note
from
miss
emily
herself
very
carefully
written
on
thin
although
it
was
years
since
i
had
seen
her
the
exquisite
neatness
of
the
letter
its
careful
paragraphing
its
margins
so
accurate
as
to
give
the
impression
that
she
had
drawn
a
faint
margin
line
with
a
lead
pencil
and
then
erased
it
all
these
were
as
indicative
of
emily
benton
as
well
as
the
letter
was
not
as
well
as
i
can
explain
it
the
letter
was
impulsive
almost
urgent
yet
the
little
old
lady
i
remembered
was
neither
of
these
things
my
dear
miss
blakiston
she
wrote
but
i
do
hope
you
will
use
the
house
it
was
because
i
wanted
to
be
certain
that
it
would
be
occupied
this
summer
that
i
asked
so
low
a
rent
for
it
you
may
call
it
a
whim
if
you
like
but
there
are
reasons
why
i
wish
the
house
to
have
a
summer
tenant
it
has
for
one
thing
never
been
empty
since
it
was
built
it
was
my
father
pride
and
his
before
him
that
the
doors
were
never
locked
even
at
night
of
course
i
can
not
ask
a
tenant
to
continue
this
old
custom
but
i
can
ask
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
will
you
forgive
me
for
saying
that
you
are
so
exactly
the
person
i
should
like
to
see
in
the
house
that
i
feel
i
can
not
give
you
up
so
strongly
do
i
feel
this
that
i
would
if
i
dared
enclose
your
check
and
beg
you
to
use
the
house
rent
free
faithfully
yours
emily
benton
gracefully
worded
and
carefully
written
as
the
letter
was
i
seemed
to
feel
behind
it
some
stress
of
feeling
an
excitement
perhaps
totally
out
of
proportion
to
its
contents
years
before
i
had
met
miss
emily
even
then
a
frail
little
old
lady
her
small
figure
stiffly
erect
her
eyes
cold
her
whole
bearing
one
of
reserve
the
bentons
for
all
their
open
doors
were
known
in
that
part
of
the
country
as
proud
i
can
remember
too
how
when
i
was
a
young
girl
my
mother
had
regarded
the
rare
invitations
to
have
tea
and
tiny
cakes
in
the
benton
parlor
as
commands
no
less
and
had
taken
the
long
from
the
city
with
complacency
and
now
miss
emily
last
of
the
family
had
begged
me
to
take
the
house
in
the
end
as
has
been
shown
i
agreed
the
glamor
of
the
past
had
perhaps
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
have
come
to
a
time
of
life
when
failing
intimate
interests
of
my
own
my
neighbors
interests
are
mine
by
adoption
to
be
frank
i
came
because
i
was
curious
why
aside
from
a
money
consideration
was
the
benton
house
to
be
occupied
by
an
alien
household
it
was
opposed
to
every
tradition
of
the
family
as
i
had
heard
of
it
i
knew
something
of
the
family
history
the
reverend
thaddeus
benton
rector
of
saint
bartholomew
who
had
forsaken
the
frame
rectory
near
the
church
to
build
himself
the
substantial
home
now
being
offered
me
miss
emily
his
daughter
who
must
now
i
computed
be
nearly
seventy
and
a
son
whom
i
recalled
faintly
as
hardly
bearing
out
the
benton
traditions
of
solidity
and
rectitude
the
reverend
benton
i
recalled
had
taken
the
stand
that
his
house
was
his
own
and
having
moved
his
family
into
it
had
thereafter
save
on
great
occasions
received
the
congregation
individually
or
en
masse
in
his
study
at
the
church
a
patriarchal
old
man
benevolent
yet
austere
who
once
according
to
a
story
i
had
heard
in
my
girlhood
had
horsewhipped
one
of
his
vestrymen
for
trifling
with
the
affections
of
a
young
married
woman
in
the
village
there
was
a
gap
of
thirty
years
in
my
knowledge
of
the
family
i
had
indeed
forgotten
its
very
existence
when
by
the
chance
of
a
newspaper
advertisement
i
found
myself
involved
vitally
in
its
affairs
playing
providence
indeed
and
both
fearing
and
hating
my
role
looking
back
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
appear
rather
curious
why
for
instance
did
maggie
my
old
servant
develop
such
a
dislike
for
the
place
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
house
she
had
not
seen
it
when
she
first
refused
to
go
but
her
reluctance
was
evident
from
the
beginning
i
just
got
a
feeling
about
it
miss
agnes
she
said
i
explain
it
any
more
than
i
can
explain
a
cold
in
the
head
but
there
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
blame
maggie
feeling
on
her
knowledge
that
the
house
was
cheap
she
knew
it
as
she
has
i
am
sure
read
all
my
letters
for
years
she
has
a
distrust
of
a
bargain
but
later
i
came
to
believe
that
there
was
something
more
to
maggie
distrust
as
though
perhaps
a
wave
of
uneasiness
spreading
from
some
unknown
source
had
engulfed
her
indeed
looking
back
over
the
two
months
i
spent
in
the
benton
house
i
am
inclined
to
go
even
further
if
thoughts
carry
as
i
am
sure
they
do
then
emotions
carry
fear
hope
courage
despair
if
the
intention
of
writing
a
letter
to
an
absent
friend
can
spread
itself
across
the
earth
so
that
as
you
write
the
friend
writes
also
and
your
letters
cross
how
much
more
should
big
emotions
carry
i
have
had
sweep
over
me
such
waves
of
gladness
such
gusts
of
despair
as
have
shaken
me
yet
with
no
cause
for
either
they
are
gone
in
a
moment
just
for
an
instant
i
have
caught
and
made
my
own
another
joy
or
grief
the
only
inexplicable
part
of
this
narrative
is
that
maggie
neither
a
psychic
nor
a
sensitive
type
caught
the
terror
as
i
came
to
call
it
before
i
did
perhaps
it
may
be
explainable
by
the
fact
that
her
mental
processes
are
comparatively
simple
her
mind
an
empty
slate
that
shows
every
mark
made
on
it
in
a
way
this
is
a
study
in
fear
maggie
resentment
continued
through
my
decision
to
use
the
house
through
the
packing
through
the
very
moving
itself
it
took
the
form
of
a
sort
of
watchful
waiting
although
at
the
time
we
neither
of
us
realized
it
and
of
dislike
of
the
house
and
its
surroundings
it
extended
itself
to
the
very
garden
where
she
gathered
flowers
for
the
table
with
a
ruthlessness
that
was
almost
vicious
and
as
july
went
on
and
miss
emily
made
her
occasional
visits
as
tiny
as
delicate
as
herself
i
had
a
curious
conclusion
forced
on
me
miss
emily
returned
her
antagonism
i
was
slow
to
credit
it
what
secret
and
even
unacknowledged
opposition
could
there
be
between
my
downright
maggie
and
this
little
old
aristocrat
with
her
frail
hands
and
the
soft
rustle
of
silk
about
her
in
miss
emily
it
took
the
form
of
how
strange
a
word
to
use
in
connection
with
her
of
furtive
watchfulness
i
felt
that
entrance
with
nothing
more
momentous
than
the
set
her
upright
in
her
chair
put
an
edge
to
her
soft
voice
and
absorbed
her
she
was
still
attentive
to
what
i
said
she
agreed
or
dissented
but
back
of
it
all
with
her
eyes
on
me
she
was
watching
maggie
with
maggie
the
antagonism
took
no
such
subtle
form
it
showed
itself
in
the
second
best
instead
of
the
best
china
and
a
tendency
to
weak
tea
when
miss
emily
took
hers
very
strong
and
such
was
the
effect
of
their
mutual
watchfulness
and
suspicion
such
perhaps
was
the
influence
of
the
staid
old
house
on
me
after
a
time
even
that
fact
of
the
strong
tea
began
to
strike
me
as
incongruous
miss
emily
was
so
consistent
so
consistently
frail
and
dainty
and
so
well
unspotted
seems
to
be
the
word
and
so
gentle
yet
as
time
went
on
i
began
to
feel
that
she
hated
maggie
with
a
real
hatred
and
there
was
the
strong
tea
indeed
it
was
not
quite
normal
nor
was
i
for
by
that
time
the
middle
of
july
it
was
before
i
figured
out
as
much
as
i
have
set
down
in
five
minutes
by
that
time
i
was
not
certain
about
the
house
it
was
difficult
to
say
just
what
i
felt
about
the
house
willie
who
came
down
over
a
sunday
early
in
the
summer
possibly
voiced
it
when
he
came
down
to
his
breakfast
there
how
did
you
sleep
i
asked
not
very
well
he
picked
up
his
and
smiled
over
it
rather
sheepishly
to
tell
the
truth
i
got
to
thinking
about
things
the
furniture
and
all
that
he
said
vaguely
how
many
people
have
sat
in
the
chairs
and
seen
themselves
in
the
mirror
and
died
in
the
bed
and
so
on
maggie
who
was
bringing
in
the
toast
gave
a
sort
of
low
moan
which
she
turned
into
a
cough
there
have
been
deaths
in
it
in
the
last
forty
years
willie
she
volunteered
that
according
to
the
gardener
and
more
than
half
died
in
that
room
of
yours
put
down
that
toast
before
you
drop
it
maggie
i
said
shaking
all
over
and
go
out
and
shut
the
door
very
well
she
said
with
a
meekness
behind
which
she
was
both
indignant
and
frightened
but
there
is
one
word
i
might
mention
before
i
go
and
that
is
cats
cats
said
willie
as
she
slammed
the
door
i
think
it
is
only
one
cat
i
observed
mildly
it
belongs
to
miss
emily
i
fancy
it
manages
to
be
in
a
lot
of
places
nearly
simultaneously
and
maggie
swears
it
is
a
dozen
willie
is
not
subtle
he
is
a
practical
young
man
with
a
growing
family
and
a
tendency
the
last
year
or
two
to
flesh
but
he
ate
his
breakfast
thoughtfully
do
you
think
it
rather
isolated
he
asked
finally
just
you
three
women
here
i
had
taken
delia
the
cook
along
we
have
a
telephone
i
said
rather
loftily
although
i
checked
myself
maggie
i
felt
sure
was
listening
in
the
pantry
and
i
intended
to
give
her
wild
fancies
no
encouragement
to
utter
a
thing
is
to
maggie
to
give
it
life
by
the
mere
use
of
the
spoken
word
it
ceases
to
be
supposition
and
becomes
fact
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
uneasiness
about
the
house
resolved
itself
into
an
uneasiness
about
the
telephone
it
seems
less
absurd
now
than
it
did
then
but
i
remember
what
willie
said
about
it
that
morning
on
our
way
to
the
church
it
rings
at
night
willie
i
said
and
when
i
go
there
is
no
one
there
so
do
all
telephones
he
replied
briskly
it
their
greatest
weakness
once
or
twice
we
have
found
the
thing
on
the
floor
in
the
morning
it
could
blow
over
or
knock
itself
down
probably
the
cat
he
said
with
the
patient
air
of
a
man
arguing
with
an
unreasonable
woman
of
course
he
added
we
were
passing
the
churchyard
then
dominated
by
what
the
village
called
the
benton
mosolem
there
a
chance
that
those
bentons
resent
anything
as
modern
as
a
telephone
it
might
be
interesting
to
see
what
they
would
do
to
a
victrola
i
going
to
tell
you
something
willie
i
said
i
am
afraid
of
the
telephone
he
was
completely
incredulous
i
felt
rather
ridiculous
standing
there
in
the
sunlight
of
that
summer
sabbath
and
making
my
confession
but
i
did
it
i
am
afraid
of
it
i
repeated
i
desperately
sure
you
will
never
understand
because
i
do
i
can
hardly
force
myself
to
go
to
it
i
hate
the
very
back
corner
of
the
hall
where
it
stands
i
i
saw
his
expression
then
and
i
stopped
furious
with
myself
why
had
i
said
it
but
more
important
still
why
did
i
feel
it
i
had
not
put
it
into
words
before
i
had
not
expected
to
say
it
then
but
the
moment
i
said
it
i
knew
it
was
true
i
had
developed
an
idee
fixe
i
have
to
go
downstairs
at
night
and
answer
it
i
added
rather
feebly
it
on
my
nerves
i
think
i
should
think
it
is
he
said
with
a
note
of
wonder
in
his
voice
it
does
sound
like
you
a
telephone
but
just
at
the
church
door
he
stopped
me
a
hand
on
my
arm
look
here
he
said
do
you
suppose
it
because
you
so
dependent
on
the
telephone
you
know
that
if
anything
goes
wrong
with
it
you
cut
off
in
a
way
and
there
another
point
you
get
all
your
news
over
it
good
and
bad
he
had
difficulty
i
think
in
finding
the
words
he
wanted
it
it
vital
he
said
so
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
it
and
it
gets
to
be
an
obsession
very
likely
i
assented
the
whole
thing
is
idiotic
anyhow
but
was
it
idiotic
i
am
endeavoring
to
set
things
down
as
they
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
not
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
for
if
this
narrative
has
any
interest
at
all
it
is
a
psychological
one
i
have
said
that
it
is
a
study
in
fear
but
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
it
is
a
study
of
the
mental
reaction
of
crime
of
its
effects
on
different
minds
more
or
less
remotely
connected
with
it
that
my
analysis
of
my
impressions
in
the
church
that
morning
are
not
colored
by
subsequent
events
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
under
cover
of
that
date
july
i
made
the
following
entry
why
do
maggie
and
miss
benton
distrust
each
other
i
realized
it
even
then
although
i
did
not
consider
it
serious
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
i
follow
it
with
a
recipe
for
fruit
gelatin
copied
from
the
newspaper
it
was
a
calm
and
sunny
sunday
morning
the
church
windows
were
wide
open
and
a
butterfly
came
in
and
set
the
choir
boys
to
giggling
at
the
end
of
my
pew
a
window
to
carlo
benton
the
name
came
like
an
echo
from
the
forgotten
past
sent
a
shower
of
colored
light
over
willie
turned
my
blue
silk
to
most
unspinsterly
hues
and
threw
a
sort
of
summer
radiance
over
miss
emily
herself
in
the
seat
ahead
she
sat
quite
alone
impeccably
neat
even
to
her
profile
she
was
so
orderly
so
well
balanced
one
stitch
of
her
organdy
collar
was
so
clearly
identical
with
every
other
her
very
seams
if
you
can
understand
it
ran
so
exactly
where
they
should
that
she
set
me
to
pulling
myself
straight
i
am
rather
casual
as
to
seams
after
a
time
i
began
to
have
a
curious
feeling
about
her
her
head
was
toward
the
rector
standing
in
a
sort
of
white
nimbus
of
sunlight
but
i
felt
that
miss
emily
entire
attention
was
on
our
pew
immediately
behind
her
i
find
i
can
not
put
it
into
words
unless
it
was
that
her
back
settled
into
more
rigid
lines
i
glanced
along
the
pew
face
wore
a
calm
and
slightly
somnolent
expression
but
maggie
in
her
far
end
she
is
very
high
church
and
always
attends
maggie
eyes
were
glued
almost
fiercely
to
miss
emily
back
and
just
then
miss
emily
herself
stirred
glanced
up
at
the
window
and
turning
slightly
returned
maggie
glance
with
one
almost
as
malevolent
i
have
hesitated
over
that
word
it
seems
strong
now
but
at
the
time
it
was
the
one
that
came
into
my
mind
when
it
was
over
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
it
had
happened
and
even
now
with
everything
else
clear
i
do
not
pretend
to
explain
attitude
she
knew
in
some
strange
way
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
knew
which
sounds
like
nonsense
and
is
as
near
as
i
can
come
to
getting
it
down
in
words
willie
left
that
night
the
and
we
settled
down
to
quiet
days
and
for
a
time
to
undisturbed
nights
but
on
the
following
wednesday
by
my
journal
the
telephone
commenced
to
bother
me
again
generally
speaking
it
rang
rather
early
between
eleven
and
midnight
but
on
the
following
saturday
night
i
find
i
have
recorded
the
hour
as
in
every
instance
the
experience
was
identical
the
telephone
never
rang
the
second
time
when
i
went
downstairs
to
answer
it
i
did
not
always
go
there
was
the
buzzing
of
the
wire
and
there
was
nothing
else
it
was
on
the
that
i
had
the
telephone
inspected
and
reported
in
normal
condition
and
it
is
possibly
significant
that
for
three
days
afterward
my
record
shows
not
a
single
disturbance
but
i
do
not
regard
the
strange
calls
over
the
telephone
as
so
important
as
my
attitude
to
them
the
plain
truth
is
that
my
fear
of
the
calls
extended
itself
in
a
few
days
to
cover
the
instrument
and
more
than
that
to
the
part
of
the
house
it
stood
in
maggie
never
had
this
nor
did
she
recognize
it
in
me
her
fear
was
a
perfectly
simple
although
uncomfortable
one
centering
around
the
bedrooms
where
in
each
bed
she
nightly
saw
dead
and
gone
bentons
laid
out
in
all
the
decorum
of
the
best
linen
on
more
than
one
evening
she
came
to
the
library
door
with
an
expression
of
mentally
looking
over
her
shoulder
and
some
such
dialogue
would
follow
mind
if
i
turn
the
bed
down
now
miss
agnes
it
very
early
eight
when
she
is
nervous
she
cuts
verbal
corners
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
dislike
having
the
beds
disturbed
until
nine
maggie
i
going
out
you
said
that
last
night
but
you
did
go
silence
now
see
here
maggie
i
want
you
to
overcome
this
feeling
of
i
hesitated
of
fear
when
you
have
really
seen
or
heard
something
it
will
be
time
enough
to
be
nervous
humph
said
maggie
on
one
of
these
occasions
and
edged
into
the
room
it
was
growing
dusk
it
will
be
too
late
then
miss
agnes
and
another
thing
you
a
brave
woman
i
do
know
as
i
seen
a
braver
but
i
notice
you
keep
away
from
the
telephone
after
dark
the
general
outcome
of
these
conversations
was
that
to
avoid
argument
i
permitted
the
preparation
of
my
room
for
the
night
at
an
earlier
and
yet
earlier
hour
until
at
last
it
was
done
the
moment
i
was
dressed
for
dinner
it
is
clear
to
me
now
that
two
entirely
different
sorts
of
fear
actuated
us
for
by
that
time
i
had
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
fear
in
the
house
even
delia
the
cook
had
absorbed
some
of
maggie
terror
possibly
traceable
to
some
early
impressions
of
death
which
connected
with
a
bedstead
of
the
two
sorts
of
fear
delia
and
maggie
symptoms
were
subjective
mine
i
still
feel
were
objective
it
was
not
long
before
the
beginning
of
august
and
during
a
lull
in
the
telephone
matter
that
i
began
to
suspect
that
the
house
was
being
visited
at
night
there
was
nothing
i
could
point
to
with
any
certainty
as
having
been
disturbed
at
first
it
was
a
matter
of
a
book
misplaced
on
the
table
of
my
open
when
i
always
leave
it
closed
of
a
burnt
match
on
the
floor
whereas
it
is
one
of
my
orderly
habits
never
to
leave
burnt
matches
around
and
at
last
the
burnt
match
became
a
sort
of
clue
for
i
suspected
that
it
had
been
used
to
light
one
of
the
candles
that
sat
in
holders
of
every
sort
on
the
top
of
the
library
shelves
i
tried
getting
up
at
night
and
peering
over
the
banisters
but
without
result
and
i
was
never
sure
as
to
articles
that
they
had
been
moved
i
remained
in
that
doubting
and
suspicious
halfway
ground
that
is
worse
than
certainty
and
there
was
the
matter
of
motive
i
could
not
get
away
from
that
what
possible
purpose
could
an
intruder
have
for
instance
in
opening
my
or
moving
the
dictionary
two
inches
on
the
center
table
yet
the
feeling
persisted
and
on
the
second
of
august
i
find
this
entry
in
my
journal
brass
eight
inches
brass
seven
inches
italian
five
and
three
quarter
inches
each
old
glass
on
mantelpiece
seven
inches
and
below
this
dated
the
third
last
night
between
midnight
and
daylight
the
candle
in
the
glass
holder
on
the
right
side
of
the
mantel
was
burned
down
one
and
inches
i
should
no
doubt
have
set
a
watch
on
my
nightly
visitor
after
making
this
discovery
and
one
that
was
apparently
connected
with
it
nothing
less
than
delia
report
that
there
were
over
the
border
of
the
library
carpet
but
i
have
admitted
that
this
is
a
study
in
fear
and
a
part
of
it
is
my
own
i
was
afraid
i
was
afraid
of
the
night
visitor
but
more
than
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
fear
it
had
become
a
real
thing
by
that
time
something
that
lurked
in
the
lower
back
hall
waiting
to
catch
me
by
the
throat
to
stop
my
breath
to
paralyze
me
so
i
could
not
escape
i
never
went
beyond
that
point
yet
i
am
not
a
cowardly
woman
i
have
lived
alone
too
long
for
that
i
have
closed
too
many
houses
at
night
and
gone
upstairs
in
the
dark
to
be
afraid
of
darkness
and
even
now
i
can
not
looking
back
admit
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
darkness
there
although
i
resorted
to
the
weak
expedient
of
leaving
a
short
length
of
candle
to
burn
itself
out
in
the
hall
when
i
went
up
to
bed
i
have
seen
one
of
willie
boys
waken
up
at
night
screaming
with
a
terror
he
could
not
describe
well
it
was
much
like
that
with
me
except
that
i
was
awake
and
horribly
ashamed
of
myself
on
the
fourth
of
august
i
find
in
my
journal
the
single
word
flour
it
recalls
both
my
own
cowardice
at
that
time
and
an
experiment
i
made
the
telephone
had
not
bothered
us
for
several
nights
and
i
began
to
suspect
a
connection
of
this
sort
when
the
telephone
rang
there
was
no
night
visitor
and
vice
versa
i
was
not
certain
delia
was
setting
bread
that
night
in
the
kitchen
and
maggie
was
reading
a
ghost
story
from
the
evening
paper
there
was
a
fine
sifting
of
flour
over
the
table
and
it
gave
me
my
idea
when
i
went
up
to
bed
that
night
i
left
a
powdering
of
flour
here
and
there
on
the
lower
floor
at
the
door
into
the
library
a
patch
by
the
table
and
going
back
rather
uneasily
one
near
the
telephone
i
was
up
and
downstairs
before
maggie
the
next
morning
the
patches
showed
trampling
in
the
doorway
they
were
almost
obliterated
as
by
the
trailing
of
a
garment
over
them
but
by
the
fireplace
there
were
two
prints
quite
distinct
i
knew
when
i
saw
them
that
i
had
expected
the
marks
of
miss
emily
tiny
foot
although
i
had
not
admitted
it
before
but
these
were
not
miss
emily
they
were
large
flat
substantial
and
one
showed
a
curious
marking
around
the
edge
that
it
was
my
own
the
marking
was
the
knitted
side
of
my
bedroom
slipper
i
had
so
far
as
i
could
tell
gone
downstairs
in
the
night
investigated
the
candles
possibly
in
darkness
and
gone
back
to
bed
again
the
effect
of
the
discovery
on
me
was
well
undermining
in
all
the
uneasiness
of
the
past
few
weeks
i
had
at
least
had
full
confidence
in
myself
and
now
that
was
gone
i
began
to
wonder
how
much
of
the
things
that
had
troubled
me
were
real
and
how
many
i
had
made
for
myself
to
tell
the
truth
by
that
time
the
tension
was
almost
unbearable
my
nerves
were
going
and
there
was
no
reason
for
it
i
kept
telling
myself
that
in
the
mirror
i
looked
white
and
anxious
and
i
had
a
sense
of
approaching
trouble
i
caught
maggie
watching
me
too
and
on
the
seventh
i
find
in
my
journal
the
words
insanity
is
often
only
a
formless
terror
on
the
sunday
morning
following
that
i
found
three
burnt
matches
in
the
library
fireplace
and
one
of
the
candles
in
the
brass
holders
was
almost
gone
i
sat
most
of
the
day
in
that
room
wondering
what
would
happen
to
me
if
i
lost
my
mind
i
knew
that
maggie
was
watching
me
and
i
made
one
of
those
absurd
hypotheses
to
myself
that
we
all
do
at
times
if
any
of
the
family
came
i
would
know
that
she
had
sent
for
them
and
that
i
was
really
deranged
it
had
been
a
long
day
with
a
steady
summer
rain
that
had
not
cooled
the
earth
but
only
set
it
steaming
the
air
was
like
hot
vapor
and
my
hair
clung
to
my
moist
forehead
at
about
four
maggie
started
chasing
a
fly
with
a
folded
newspaper
she
followed
it
about
the
lower
floor
from
room
to
room
making
little
harsh
noises
in
her
throat
when
she
missed
it
the
sound
of
the
soft
thud
of
the
paper
on
walls
and
furniture
seemed
suddenly
more
than
i
could
bear
for
heaven
sake
i
cried
stop
that
noise
maggie
i
felt
as
though
my
eyes
were
starting
from
my
head
it
a
fly
she
said
doggedly
and
aimed
another
blow
at
it
if
i
do
kill
it
we
have
a
million
there
it
on
the
mantel
now
i
never
i
felt
that
if
she
raised
the
paper
club
once
more
i
should
scream
so
i
got
up
quickly
and
caught
her
wrist
she
was
so
astonished
that
she
let
the
paper
drop
and
there
we
stood
staring
at
each
other
i
can
still
see
the
way
her
mouth
hung
open
do
i
said
and
my
voice
sounded
thick
even
to
my
own
ears
maggie
i
ca
stand
it
my
god
miss
agnes
her
tone
brought
me
up
sharply
i
released
her
arm
i
i
just
nervous
maggie
i
said
and
sat
down
i
was
trembling
violently
i
was
sane
i
knew
it
then
as
i
know
it
now
but
i
was
not
rational
perhaps
to
most
of
us
come
now
and
then
times
when
they
realize
that
some
act
or
some
thought
is
not
balanced
as
though
for
a
moment
or
an
hour
the
control
was
gone
from
the
brain
or
and
i
think
this
was
the
feeling
i
had
that
some
other
control
was
in
charge
not
the
agnes
blakiston
i
knew
but
another
agnes
blakiston
perhaps
was
exerting
a
temporary
dominance
a
hectic
craven
and
hateful
control
that
is
the
only
outburst
i
recall
possibly
maggie
may
have
others
stored
away
she
has
a
tenacious
memory
certainly
it
was
my
nearest
approach
to
violence
but
it
had
the
effect
of
making
me
set
a
watch
on
myself
possibly
it
was
coincidence
probably
however
maggie
had
communicated
with
willie
but
two
days
later
young
martin
sprague
freda
son
stopped
his
car
in
the
drive
and
came
in
he
is
a
nerve
specialist
and
very
good
although
i
can
remember
when
he
came
down
in
his
night
drawers
to
one
of
his
mother
thought
i
would
just
run
in
and
see
you
he
said
mother
told
me
you
were
here
by
george
miss
agnes
you
look
younger
than
ever
who
told
you
to
come
martie
i
asked
told
me
i
do
have
to
be
told
to
visit
an
old
friend
well
he
asked
himself
to
lunch
and
looked
over
the
house
and
decided
to
ask
miss
emily
if
she
would
sell
an
old
japanese
cabinet
inlaid
with
mother
of
pearl
that
i
would
not
have
had
as
a
gift
and
in
the
end
i
told
him
my
trouble
of
the
fear
that
seemed
to
center
around
the
telephone
and
the
he
listened
carefully
ever
get
any
bad
news
over
the
telephone
he
asked
one
way
and
another
i
said
i
had
had
plenty
of
it
he
went
over
me
thoroughly
and
was
inclined
to
find
my
experience
with
the
flour
rather
amusing
than
otherwise
it
rather
good
that
he
said
setting
a
trap
to
catch
yourself
you
better
have
maggie
sleep
in
your
room
for
a
while
well
it
all
pretty
plain
miss
agnes
we
bury
some
things
as
deep
as
possible
especially
if
we
do
want
to
remember
that
they
ever
happened
but
the
mind
a
queer
thing
it
holds
on
pretty
hard
and
burying
is
not
destroying
then
we
get
tired
or
nervous
maybe
just
holding
the
thing
down
and
pretending
it
is
not
there
makes
us
nervous
and
up
it
pops
like
the
ghost
of
a
buried
body
and
raises
hell
you
do
mind
that
do
you
he
added
anxiously
it
exactly
what
those
things
do
raise
but
i
demanded
irritably
who
rings
the
telephone
at
night
i
daresay
you
do
contend
that
i
go
out
at
night
and
call
the
house
and
then
come
back
and
answer
the
call
do
you
he
looked
at
me
with
a
maddening
smile
are
you
sure
it
really
rings
he
asked
and
so
bad
was
my
nervous
condition
by
that
time
so
undermined
was
my
that
i
was
not
certain
and
this
in
face
of
the
fact
that
it
invariably
roused
maggie
as
well
as
myself
on
the
eleventh
of
august
miss
emily
came
to
tea
the
date
does
not
matter
but
by
following
the
chronology
of
my
journal
i
find
i
can
keep
my
narrative
in
proper
sequence
i
had
felt
better
that
day
so
far
as
i
could
determine
i
had
not
walked
in
my
sleep
again
and
there
was
about
maggie
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
relief
which
showed
that
my
condition
was
more
nearly
normal
than
it
had
been
for
some
time
the
fear
of
the
telephone
and
of
the
back
hall
was
leaving
me
too
perhaps
martin
explanation
had
helped
me
but
my
own
theory
had
always
been
the
one
i
recorded
at
the
beginning
of
this
narrative
that
i
caught
and
well
registered
is
a
good
word
that
i
registered
an
overwhelming
fear
from
some
unknown
source
i
spied
miss
emily
as
she
got
out
of
the
hack
that
day
a
cool
little
figure
clad
in
a
thin
black
silk
dress
with
the
sheerest
possible
white
collars
and
cuffs
her
small
bonnet
with
its
crepe
veil
was
faced
with
white
and
her
carefully
crimped
gray
hair
showed
a
wavy
border
beneath
it
staley
the
station
hackman
helped
her
out
of
the
surrey
and
handed
her
the
without
which
she
was
seldom
seen
it
was
two
weeks
since
she
had
been
there
and
she
came
slowly
up
the
walk
looking
from
side
to
side
at
the
perennial
borders
then
in
full
august
bloom
she
smiled
when
she
saw
me
in
the
doorway
and
said
with
the
little
anxious
pucker
between
her
eyes
that
was
so
childish
do
you
think
peonies
are
better
cut
down
at
this
time
of
year
she
took
a
folded
handkerchief
from
her
bag
and
dabbed
at
her
face
where
there
was
no
sign
of
dust
to
mar
its
old
freshness
it
gives
the
lilies
a
better
chance
my
dear
i
led
her
into
the
house
and
she
produced
a
gay
bit
of
knitting
a
baby
afghan
by
the
signs
she
smiled
at
me
over
it
i
am
always
one
baby
behind
she
explained
and
fell
to
work
rapidly
she
had
lovely
hands
and
i
suspected
them
of
being
her
one
vanity
maggie
was
serving
tea
with
her
usual
grudging
reluctance
and
i
noticed
then
that
when
she
was
in
the
room
miss
emily
said
little
or
nothing
i
thought
it
probable
that
she
did
not
approve
of
conversing
before
servants
and
would
have
let
it
go
at
that
had
i
not
as
i
held
out
miss
emily
cup
caught
her
looking
at
maggie
i
had
a
swift
impression
of
antagonism
again
of
alertness
and
something
more
when
maggie
went
out
miss
emily
turned
to
me
she
is
very
capable
i
fancy
very
entirely
too
capable
she
looks
sharp
said
miss
emily
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
heard
the
word
so
used
but
it
was
very
apt
maggie
was
indeed
sharp
but
miss
emily
launched
into
a
general
dissertation
on
servants
and
sharpness
was
forgotten
it
was
i
think
when
she
was
about
to
go
that
i
asked
her
about
the
telephone
telephone
she
inquired
why
no
it
has
always
done
very
well
of
course
after
a
heavy
snow
in
the
winter
sometimes
she
had
a
fashion
of
leaving
her
sentences
unfinished
they
trailed
off
without
any
abrupt
break
it
rings
at
night
rings
i
am
called
frequently
and
when
i
get
to
the
phone
there
is
no
one
there
some
of
my
irritation
doubtless
got
into
my
voice
for
miss
emily
suddenly
drew
away
and
stared
at
me
but
that
is
very
strange
i
she
had
gone
pale
i
saw
that
now
and
quite
suddenly
she
dropped
her
when
i
restored
it
to
her
she
was
very
calm
and
poised
but
her
color
had
not
come
back
it
has
always
been
very
satisfactory
she
said
i
do
know
that
it
ever
she
considered
and
began
again
why
not
just
ignore
it
if
some
one
is
playing
a
malicious
trick
on
you
the
only
thing
is
to
ignore
it
her
hands
were
shaking
although
her
voice
was
quiet
i
saw
that
when
she
tried
to
tie
the
ribbons
of
the
bag
and
i
wondered
at
this
in
so
gentle
a
soul
there
was
a
hint
of
anger
in
her
tones
there
was
an
edge
to
her
voice
that
she
could
be
angry
was
a
surprise
and
i
found
that
she
could
also
be
obstinate
for
we
came
to
an
impasse
over
the
telephone
in
the
next
few
minutes
and
over
something
so
absurd
that
i
was
it
was
over
her
unqualified
refusal
to
allow
me
to
install
a
branch
wire
to
my
bedroom
but
i
expostulated
when
one
thinks
of
the
convenience
and
i
am
sorry
her
voice
had
a
note
of
finality
i
daresay
i
am
but
i
do
not
like
changes
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
not
to
interfere
with
the
telephone
i
could
hardly
credit
my
senses
her
tone
was
one
of
reproof
plus
decision
it
convicted
me
of
an
indiscretion
if
i
had
asked
to
take
the
roof
off
and
replace
it
with
silk
umbrellas
it
might
have
been
justified
but
to
a
request
to
move
the
telephone
of
course
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
said
i
shall
not
touch
it
i
dropped
the
subject
a
trifle
ruffled
i
confess
and
went
upstairs
to
fetch
a
box
in
which
miss
emily
was
to
carry
away
some
flowers
from
the
garden
it
was
when
i
was
coming
down
the
staircase
that
i
saw
maggie
she
had
carried
the
hall
candlesticks
newly
polished
to
their
places
on
the
table
and
was
standing
a
hand
on
each
one
staring
into
the
old
washington
mirror
in
front
of
her
from
where
she
was
she
must
have
had
a
full
view
of
miss
emily
in
the
library
and
maggie
was
bristling
it
was
the
only
word
for
it
she
was
still
there
when
miss
emily
had
gone
blowing
on
the
mirror
and
polishing
it
and
i
took
her
to
task
for
her
unfriendly
attitude
to
the
little
old
lady
you
practically
threw
her
muffins
at
her
i
said
and
i
must
speak
again
about
the
cups
what
does
she
come
snooping
around
for
anyhow
she
broke
in
we
paying
for
her
house
did
she
get
down
on
her
bended
knees
and
beg
us
to
take
it
is
that
any
reason
why
we
should
be
uncivil
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
maggie
said
truculently
what
right
has
she
to
come
back
and
spy
on
us
for
that
what
she
doing
miss
agnes
do
you
know
what
she
was
at
when
i
looked
in
at
her
she
was
running
a
finger
along
the
baseboard
to
see
if
it
was
clean
and
more
i
caught
her
at
it
once
before
in
the
back
hall
when
she
was
pretending
to
telephone
for
the
station
hack
it
was
that
day
i
think
that
i
put
fresh
candles
in
all
the
holders
downstairs
i
had
made
a
resolution
like
this
to
renew
the
candles
and
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
and
throw
the
key
over
the
transom
to
maggie
if
in
the
mornings
that
followed
the
candles
had
been
used
it
would
prove
that
martin
sprague
was
wrong
that
even
could
lie
and
that
some
one
was
investigating
the
lower
floor
at
night
for
while
my
reason
told
me
that
i
had
been
the
intruder
my
intuition
continued
to
insist
that
my
sleepwalking
was
a
result
not
a
cause
in
a
word
i
had
gone
downstairs
because
i
knew
that
there
had
been
and
might
be
again
a
night
visitor
yet
there
was
something
of
comedy
in
that
night
precautions
after
all
at
i
was
undressed
and
maggie
had
with
rebellion
in
every
line
of
her
locked
me
in
i
could
hear
her
afterwards
running
along
the
hall
to
her
own
room
and
slamming
the
door
then
a
moment
later
the
telephone
rang
it
was
too
early
i
reasoned
for
the
night
calls
it
might
be
anything
a
telegram
at
the
station
willie
boy
run
over
by
an
automobile
gertrude
children
a
dozen
possibilities
ran
through
my
mind
and
maggie
would
not
let
me
out
you
not
going
downstairs
she
called
from
a
safe
distance
maggie
i
cried
sharply
and
banged
at
the
door
the
telephone
was
ringing
steadily
come
here
at
once
miss
agnes
she
beseeched
you
go
to
bed
and
do
listen
be
nothing
there
for
all
your
trouble
she
said
in
a
quavering
voice
it
nothing
human
that
rings
that
bell
finally
however
she
freed
me
and
i
went
down
the
stairs
i
had
carried
down
a
lamp
and
my
nerves
were
vibrating
to
the
rhythm
of
the
bell
shrill
summons
but
strangely
enough
the
fear
had
left
me
i
find
as
always
that
it
is
difficult
to
put
into
words
i
did
not
relish
the
excursion
to
the
lower
floor
i
resented
the
jarring
sound
of
the
bell
but
the
terror
was
gone
i
went
back
to
the
telephone
something
that
was
living
and
moving
was
there
i
saw
its
eyes
lower
than
mine
reflecting
the
lamp
like
twin
lights
i
was
frightened
but
still
it
was
not
the
fear
the
twin
lights
leaped
forward
and
proved
to
be
the
eyes
of
miss
emily
cat
which
had
been
sleeping
on
the
stand
i
answered
the
telephone
to
my
surprise
it
was
miss
emily
herself
a
quiet
and
very
dignified
voice
which
apologized
for
disturbing
me
at
that
hour
and
went
on
i
feel
that
i
was
very
abrupt
this
afternoon
miss
blakiston
my
excuse
is
that
i
have
always
feared
change
i
have
lived
in
a
rut
too
long
afraid
but
of
course
if
you
feel
you
would
like
to
move
the
telephone
or
put
in
an
upstairs
instrument
you
may
do
as
you
like
she
seemed
having
got
me
there
unwilling
to
ring
off
i
got
a
curious
effect
of
reluctance
over
the
telephone
and
there
was
one
phrase
that
she
repeated
several
times
i
do
not
want
to
influence
you
i
want
you
to
do
just
what
you
think
best
the
fear
was
entirely
gone
by
the
time
she
rang
off
i
felt
instead
a
sort
of
relaxation
that
was
most
comforting
the
rear
hall
a
of
nervousness
in
the
daytime
and
of
horror
at
night
was
suddenly
transformed
by
the
light
of
my
lamp
into
a
warm
and
cheerful
refuge
from
the
darkness
of
the
lower
floor
the
purring
of
the
cat
comfortably
settled
on
the
was
as
cheering
as
the
singing
of
a
kettle
on
a
stove
on
the
rack
near
me
my
garden
hat
and
an
old
paisley
shawl
made
a
grotesque
human
effigy
i
sat
back
in
the
low
wicker
chair
and
surveyed
the
hallway
why
not
i
considered
do
away
now
with
the
fear
of
it
if
i
could
conquer
it
like
this
at
midnight
i
need
never
succumb
again
to
it
in
the
light
the
cat
leaped
to
the
stand
beside
me
and
stood
there
waiting
he
was
an
intelligent
animal
and
i
am
like
a
good
many
spinsters
i
am
not
more
fond
of
cats
than
other
people
but
i
understand
them
better
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
and
i
were
going
through
some
familiar
program
of
which
a
part
had
been
neglected
the
cat
neither
sat
nor
lay
but
stood
there
waiting
so
at
last
i
fetched
the
shawl
from
the
rack
and
made
him
a
bed
on
the
stand
it
was
what
he
had
been
waiting
for
i
saw
that
at
once
he
walked
onto
it
turned
around
once
lay
down
and
closed
his
eyes
i
took
up
my
vigil
i
had
been
the
victim
of
a
fear
i
was
determined
to
conquer
the
house
was
quiet
maggie
had
retired
shriveled
to
bed
the
cat
slept
on
the
shawl
and
then
i
felt
the
fear
returning
it
welled
up
through
my
tranquillity
like
a
flood
and
swept
me
with
it
i
wanted
to
shriek
i
was
afraid
to
shriek
i
longed
to
escape
i
dared
not
move
there
had
been
no
sound
no
motion
things
were
as
they
had
been
it
may
have
been
one
minute
or
five
that
i
sat
there
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
sat
with
fixed
eyes
not
even
blinking
for
fear
of
even
for
a
second
shutting
out
the
sane
and
visible
world
about
me
a
sense
of
deadness
commenced
in
my
hands
and
worked
up
my
arms
my
chest
seemed
flattened
then
the
telephone
bell
rang
the
cat
leaped
to
his
feet
somehow
i
reached
forward
and
took
down
the
receiver
who
is
it
i
cried
in
a
voice
that
was
thin
i
knew
and
unnatural
the
telephone
is
not
a
perfect
medium
it
loses
much
that
we
wish
to
register
but
also
it
registers
much
that
we
may
wish
to
lose
therefore
when
i
say
that
i
distinctly
heard
a
gasp
followed
by
heavy
difficult
breathing
over
the
telephone
i
must
beg
for
credence
it
is
true
some
one
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
struggling
for
breath
then
there
was
complete
silence
i
realized
after
a
moment
that
the
circuit
had
been
stealthily
cut
and
that
my
conviction
was
verified
by
central
demand
a
moment
later
of
what
number
i
wanted
i
was
at
first
unable
to
answer
her
when
i
did
speak
my
voice
was
shaken
what
number
please
she
repeated
in
a
bored
tone
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
so
bored
as
the
voice
of
a
small
town
you
called
i
said
beg
must
have
been
a
mistake
she
replied
glibly
and
cut
me
off
ii
it
may
be
said
and
with
truth
that
so
far
i
have
recorded
little
but
subjective
terror
possibly
easily
explained
by
my
occupancy
of
an
isolated
house
plus
a
few
unimportant
incidents
capable
of
various
interpretations
but
the
fear
was
and
is
today
as
i
look
back
a
real
thing
as
real
and
as
difficult
to
describe
as
a
chill
for
instance
a
severe
mental
chill
it
was
indeed
i
went
upstairs
finally
to
a
restless
night
and
rose
early
after
only
an
hour
or
so
of
sleep
one
thing
i
was
determined
on
to
find
out
if
possible
the
connection
between
the
terror
and
the
telephone
i
breakfasted
early
and
was
dressing
to
go
to
the
village
when
i
had
a
visitor
no
other
than
miss
emily
herself
she
looked
fluttered
and
perturbed
at
the
unceremonious
hour
of
her
visit
she
was
the
soul
of
convention
and
explained
between
breaths
as
it
were
that
she
had
come
to
apologize
for
the
day
before
she
had
hardly
slept
i
must
forgive
her
she
had
been
very
nervous
since
her
brother
death
and
small
things
upset
her
how
much
of
what
i
say
of
miss
emily
depends
on
my
later
knowledge
i
wonder
did
i
notice
then
that
she
was
watching
me
furtively
or
is
it
only
on
looking
back
that
i
recall
it
i
do
recall
it
the
hall
door
open
and
a
vista
of
smiling
garden
beyond
and
silhouetted
against
the
sunshine
miss
emily
frail
figure
and
searching
slightly
uplifted
face
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
that
i
had
not
seen
before
a
sort
of
exaltation
she
was
not
that
morning
the
miss
emily
who
ran
a
finger
along
her
baseboards
to
see
if
we
dusted
them
she
had
walked
out
and
it
had
exhausted
her
she
breathed
in
little
gasps
i
think
she
said
at
last
that
i
must
telephone
for
staley
i
am
never
very
strong
in
hot
weather
please
let
me
call
him
for
you
miss
emily
i
am
not
a
young
woman
and
she
was
at
least
but
because
she
was
so
small
and
frail
i
felt
almost
a
motherly
anxiety
for
her
that
morning
i
think
i
should
like
to
do
it
if
you
do
mind
we
are
old
friends
he
always
comes
promptly
when
i
call
him
she
went
back
alone
and
i
waited
in
the
doorway
when
she
came
out
she
was
smiling
and
there
was
more
color
in
her
face
he
is
coming
at
once
he
is
always
very
thoughtful
for
me
now
without
any
warning
something
that
had
been
seething
since
her
breathless
arrival
took
shape
in
my
mind
and
became
suspicion
what
if
it
had
been
miss
emily
who
had
called
me
the
second
time
to
the
telephone
and
having
established
the
connection
had
waited
breathing
hard
for
what
it
was
fantastic
incredible
in
the
light
of
that
brilliant
summer
day
i
looked
at
her
dainty
and
exquisite
as
ever
her
ruchings
fresh
and
white
her
very
face
indicative
of
decorum
and
order
her
wistful
old
mouth
still
rather
like
a
child
her
eyes
always
slightly
upturned
because
of
her
diminutive
height
so
that
she
had
habitually
a
look
of
adoration
one
of
earth
saints
the
rector
had
said
to
me
on
sunday
morning
a
good
woman
miss
blakiston
and
a
sacrifice
to
an
unworthy
family
suspicion
is
like
the
rain
it
falls
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
and
that
morning
i
began
to
suspect
miss
emily
i
had
no
idea
of
what
on
my
mentioning
an
errand
in
the
village
she
promptly
offered
to
take
me
with
her
in
the
staley
hack
she
had
completely
altered
in
manner
the
strain
was
gone
in
her
soft
low
voice
as
we
made
our
way
to
the
road
she
told
me
the
stories
of
some
of
the
garden
flowers
the
climbing
rose
over
the
arch
my
dear
she
said
my
mother
brought
from
england
on
her
wedding
journey
people
have
taken
cuttings
from
it
again
and
again
but
the
cuttings
never
thrive
a
bad
winter
and
they
are
gone
but
this
one
has
lived
of
course
now
and
then
it
freezes
down
she
chattered
on
and
my
suspicions
grew
more
and
more
shadowy
they
would
have
gone
i
think
had
not
maggie
called
me
back
with
a
grocery
list
a
sack
of
flour
she
said
and
some
green
vegetables
and
miss
agnes
that
woman
was
down
on
her
knees
beside
the
telephone
and
bluing
for
the
laundry
and
i
guess
that
all
the
telephone
it
was
always
the
telephone
we
drove
on
down
the
lane
eyed
somnolently
by
spotted
cows
and
incurious
sheep
and
all
the
way
miss
emily
talked
she
was
almost
garrulous
she
asked
the
hackman
about
his
family
and
stopped
the
vehicle
to
pick
up
a
peddler
overburdened
with
his
pack
i
watched
her
with
amazement
evidently
this
was
staley
miss
emily
but
it
was
not
mine
but
i
saw
mine
too
that
morning
it
was
when
i
asked
the
hackman
to
put
me
down
at
the
little
telephone
building
i
thought
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
although
the
next
moment
she
was
only
adjusting
the
ruching
at
her
neck
you
you
have
decided
to
have
the
second
telephone
put
in
then
i
hesitated
she
so
obviously
did
not
want
it
installed
and
was
i
to
submit
meekly
to
the
fear
again
without
another
effort
to
vanquish
it
i
think
not
dear
miss
emily
i
said
at
last
smiling
at
her
drawn
face
why
should
i
disturb
your
lovely
old
house
and
its
established
order
but
i
want
you
to
do
just
what
you
think
best
she
protested
she
had
put
her
hands
together
it
was
almost
a
supplication
as
to
the
strange
night
calls
there
was
little
to
be
learned
the
night
operator
was
in
bed
the
manager
made
a
note
of
my
complaint
and
promised
an
investigation
which
having
had
experience
with
telephone
investigations
i
felt
would
lead
nowhere
i
left
the
building
with
my
grocery
list
in
my
hand
the
hack
was
gone
of
course
but
i
may
have
imagined
it
i
thought
i
saw
miss
emily
peering
at
me
from
behind
the
bonnets
and
hats
in
the
milliner
window
i
did
not
investigate
the
thing
was
enough
on
my
nerves
as
it
was
maggie
served
me
my
luncheon
in
a
sort
of
strained
silence
she
observed
once
as
she
brought
me
my
tea
that
she
was
giving
me
notice
and
intended
leaving
on
the
afternoon
train
she
had
she
stated
holding
out
the
to
me
at
arm
length
stood
a
great
deal
in
the
way
of
irregular
hours
from
me
seeing
as
i
would
read
myself
to
sleep
and
let
the
light
burn
all
night
although
very
fussy
about
the
but
she
had
reached
the
end
of
her
tether
and
you
could
grate
a
lemon
on
her
most
anywhere
she
was
that
covered
with
about
what
i
demanded
and
either
throw
the
sugar
to
me
or
come
closer
i
do
know
about
what
she
said
sullenly
i
just
scared
and
for
once
maggie
and
i
were
in
complete
harmony
i
too
was
just
scared
we
were
however
both
of
us
much
nearer
a
solution
of
our
troubles
than
we
had
any
idea
of
i
say
solution
although
it
but
substituted
one
mystery
for
another
it
gave
tangibility
to
the
intangible
indeed
but
i
can
not
see
that
our
situation
was
any
better
i
for
one
found
myself
in
the
position
of
having
a
problem
to
solve
and
no
formula
to
solve
it
with
the
afternoon
was
quiet
maggie
and
the
cook
were
in
the
throes
of
and
i
had
picked
up
a
narrative
history
of
the
county
written
most
pedantically
although
with
here
and
there
a
touch
of
heavy
lightness
by
miss
emily
father
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
benton
on
the
she
had
inscribed
written
by
my
dear
father
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
and
published
after
his
death
by
the
parish
to
which
he
had
given
so
much
of
his
noble
life
the
book
left
me
cold
but
the
inscription
warmed
me
whatever
feeling
i
might
have
had
about
miss
emily
died
of
that
inscription
a
devoted
and
daughter
a
woman
both
loving
and
beloved
that
was
the
miss
emily
of
the
dedication
to
fifty
years
in
bolivar
county
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
maggie
appeared
with
a
saucer
and
a
teaspoon
in
the
saucer
she
had
poured
a
little
of
the
jelly
to
test
it
and
she
was
blowing
on
it
when
she
entered
i
put
down
my
book
well
i
said
do
tell
me
you
not
dressed
yet
you
just
got
about
time
for
the
afternoon
train
she
gave
me
an
imploring
glance
over
the
saucer
you
might
just
take
a
look
at
this
miss
agnes
she
said
it
jells
around
the
edges
but
in
the
middle
i
send
your
trunk
tomorrow
i
said
and
you
better
let
delia
make
the
jelly
alone
you
have
much
time
and
she
says
she
makes
good
jelly
she
raised
anguished
eyes
to
mine
miss
agnes
she
said
that
woman
never
made
a
glass
of
jelly
in
her
life
before
she
did
even
know
about
putting
a
silver
spoon
in
the
tumblers
to
keep
from
breaking
i
picked
up
bolivar
county
and
opened
it
but
i
could
see
that
the
hands
holding
the
saucer
were
shaking
i
not
going
miss
agnes
said
maggie
i
had
of
course
known
she
would
not
the
surprising
thing
to
me
is
that
she
never
learns
this
fact
although
she
gives
me
notice
quite
regularly
she
always
thinks
that
she
is
really
going
until
the
last
of
course
you
can
let
that
woman
make
the
jelly
if
you
want
it
your
fruit
and
sugar
but
not
going
to
desert
you
in
your
hour
of
need
what
do
i
need
i
demanded
jelly
but
she
was
past
sarcasm
she
placed
the
saucer
on
a
table
and
rolled
her
stained
hands
in
her
apron
that
woman
she
said
what
was
she
doing
under
the
telephone
stand
she
almost
immediately
burst
into
tears
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
caught
what
she
feared
for
she
was
more
concrete
than
i
and
she
knew
now
what
she
was
afraid
of
it
was
either
a
bomb
or
fire
mark
my
words
miss
agnes
she
said
she
going
to
destroy
the
place
what
made
her
set
out
and
rent
it
for
almost
nothing
if
she
is
and
i
know
who
rings
the
telephone
at
night
it
her
what
on
earth
for
i
demanded
as
ungrammatical
and
hardly
less
uneasy
than
maggie
she
wakes
us
up
so
we
can
get
out
in
time
she
a
daughter
more
than
likely
she
draws
the
line
at
bloodshed
that
one
reason
maybe
there
another
what
if
by
pressing
a
button
somewhere
and
ringing
that
bell
it
sets
off
a
bomb
somewhere
it
never
has
i
observed
dryly
but
however
absurd
maggie
logic
might
be
she
was
firm
in
her
major
premise
miss
emily
had
been
on
her
hands
and
knees
by
the
and
had
on
seeing
maggie
observed
that
she
had
dropped
the
money
for
the
hackman
out
of
her
glove
which
i
do
believe
her
gloves
were
on
the
stand
if
you
come
back
miss
agnes
i
show
you
how
she
was
we
made
rather
an
absurd
procession
maggie
leading
with
the
saucer
i
following
and
the
cat
appearing
from
nowhere
as
usual
bringing
up
the
rear
maggie
placed
the
jelly
on
the
stand
and
dropped
on
her
hands
and
knees
crawling
under
the
stand
a
confused
huddle
of
gingham
apron
and
suspicion
she
had
her
head
down
like
this
she
said
in
rather
a
smothered
voice
i
her
and
you
me
and
i
says
it
rolled
off
somewhere
i
find
it
next
time
i
sweep
and
give
it
back
to
you
well
what
think
of
that
here
it
is
my
attention
had
by
this
time
been
caught
by
the
jelly
now
unmistakably
solidifying
in
the
center
i
moved
to
the
kitchen
door
to
tell
delia
to
take
it
off
the
fire
when
i
returned
maggie
was
digging
under
the
telephone
with
a
and
muttering
to
herself
darnation
she
said
it
gone
under
if
you
do
get
it
i
reminded
her
it
belongs
to
miss
emily
there
is
a
curious
strain
of
cupidity
in
maggie
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
it
with
her
own
money
she
is
as
free
as
air
but
let
her
see
a
chance
for
illegitimate
gain
of
finding
a
penny
on
the
street
of
not
paying
her
fare
on
the
cars
of
passing
a
bad
quarter
and
she
is
filled
with
an
unholy
joy
and
so
today
the
jelly
was
forgotten
terror
was
gone
all
that
existed
for
maggie
was
a
cent
piece
under
a
suddenly
she
wailed
it
gone
miss
agnes
it
clear
under
good
heavens
maggie
what
difference
does
it
make
mind
if
i
got
the
and
unscrewed
the
box
my
menage
is
always
notoriously
short
of
tools
i
forbade
it
at
once
and
ordered
her
back
to
the
kitchen
and
after
a
final
squint
along
the
carpet
head
flat
she
dragged
herself
out
and
to
her
feet
i
get
the
jelly
off
she
said
and
then
maybe
a
hat
pin
reach
it
i
can
see
the
edge
of
it
a
loud
crack
from
the
kitchen
announced
that
cook
had
forgotten
the
silver
spoon
and
took
maggie
off
on
a
jump
i
went
back
to
the
library
and
bolivar
county
and
i
must
confess
to
a
nap
in
my
chair
i
was
roused
by
the
feeling
that
some
one
was
staring
at
me
my
eyes
focused
first
on
the
icepick
then
as
i
slowly
raised
them
on
face
set
in
hard
and
uncompromising
lines
i
thank
you
to
come
with
me
she
said
stiffly
come
where
to
the
telephone
i
groaned
inwardly
but
because
submission
to
maggie
tyranny
has
become
a
firm
habit
with
me
i
rose
i
saw
then
that
she
held
a
dingy
quarter
in
one
hand
without
a
word
she
turned
and
stalked
ahead
of
me
into
the
hall
it
is
curious
looking
back
and
remembering
that
she
had
then
no
knowledge
of
the
significance
of
things
to
remember
how
hard
and
inexorable
her
back
was
viewed
through
the
light
of
what
followed
i
have
never
been
able
to
visualize
maggie
moving
down
the
hall
it
has
always
been
a
menacing
figure
rather
shadowy
than
real
and
the
hail
itself
takes
on
grotesque
proportions
becomes
inordinately
long
an
infinity
of
hall
fading
away
into
time
and
distance
yet
it
was
only
a
moment
of
course
until
i
stood
by
the
telephone
maggie
had
been
at
work
the
wooden
box
which
covered
the
had
been
removed
and
lay
on
its
side
the
were
uncovered
giving
an
effect
of
mystery
unveiled
a
sort
of
shamelessness
of
destroyed
illusion
maggie
pointed
there
a
paper
under
one
of
the
jars
she
said
i
have
touched
it
but
i
know
well
enough
what
it
is
i
have
not
questioned
maggie
on
this
point
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
expected
to
find
a
sort
of
final
summons
of
death
for
one
or
the
other
of
us
the
paper
was
there
a
small
folded
scrap
partially
concealed
under
a
jar
them
prints
was
there
too
maggie
said
the
box
had
accumulated
the
flocculent
floating
particles
of
months
possibly
years
lint
from
the
hall
carpet
giving
it
a
reddish
tinge
and
in
this
light
and
evanescent
deposit
fluttered
by
a
breath
fingers
had
moved
searched
i
am
tempted
to
say
groped
although
the
word
seems
absurd
for
anything
so
small
the
imprint
of
maggie
coin
and
of
her
attempts
at
salvage
were
at
the
edge
and
quite
distinct
from
the
others
i
lifted
the
jar
and
picked
up
the
paper
it
was
folded
and
refolded
until
it
was
not
much
larger
than
a
a
rather
stiff
paper
crossed
with
faint
blue
lines
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
have
opened
it
it
had
been
so
plainly
in
hiding
and
was
so
obviously
not
my
affair
had
not
maggie
suddenly
gasped
and
implored
me
not
to
look
at
it
i
immediately
determined
to
examine
it
yet
after
i
had
read
it
twice
it
had
hardly
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
there
are
some
things
so
incredible
that
the
brain
automatically
rejects
them
i
looked
at
the
paper
i
read
it
with
my
eyes
but
i
did
not
grasp
it
it
was
not
note
paper
it
was
apparently
torn
from
a
tablet
of
glazed
and
ruled
paper
just
such
paper
for
instance
as
maggie
soaks
in
brandy
and
places
on
top
of
her
jelly
before
tying
it
up
it
had
been
raggedly
torn
the
scrap
was
the
full
width
of
the
sheet
but
only
three
inches
or
so
deep
it
was
undated
and
this
is
what
it
said
to
whom
it
may
concern
on
the
day
of
may
i
killed
a
woman
here
in
this
house
i
hope
you
will
not
find
this
until
i
am
dead
signed
emily
benton
maggie
had
read
the
confession
over
my
shoulder
and
i
felt
her
body
grow
rigid
as
for
myself
my
first
sensation
was
one
of
acute
discomfort
that
we
should
have
exposed
the
confession
to
the
light
of
day
neither
of
us
i
am
sure
had
really
grasped
it
maggie
put
a
trembling
hand
on
my
arm
the
brass
of
her
she
said
in
a
thin
terrified
voice
and
sitting
in
church
like
the
rest
of
us
oh
my
god
miss
agnes
put
it
back
i
whirled
on
her
in
a
fury
that
was
only
an
outlet
for
my
own
shock
once
for
all
maggie
i
said
i
ask
you
to
wait
until
you
are
spoken
to
and
if
i
hear
that
you
have
so
much
as
mentioned
this
piece
of
paper
out
you
go
and
never
come
back
but
she
was
beyond
apprehension
she
was
literal
too
she
saw
not
miss
emily
unbelievably
associated
with
a
crime
but
the
crime
itself
who
suppose
it
was
miss
agnes
i
do
believe
it
at
all
some
one
has
placed
it
there
to
hurt
miss
emily
it
her
writing
said
maggie
doggedly
after
a
time
i
got
rid
of
her
and
sat
down
to
think
in
the
library
rather
i
sat
down
to
reason
with
myself
for
every
atom
of
my
brain
was
clamoring
that
this
thing
was
true
that
my
little
miss
emily
exquisite
and
fine
as
she
was
had
done
the
thing
she
claimed
to
have
done
it
was
her
own
writing
thin
faintly
shaded
as
neat
and
as
erect
as
herself
but
even
that
i
would
not
accept
until
i
had
compared
it
with
such
bits
of
hers
as
i
possessed
the
note
begging
me
to
take
the
house
the
inscription
on
the
of
fifty
years
in
bolivar
county
and
here
was
something
i
could
not
quite
understand
the
writing
was
all
of
the
same
order
but
while
the
confession
and
the
inscription
in
the
book
were
similar
letter
for
letter
in
the
note
to
me
there
were
differences
a
change
in
the
t
in
benton
a
fuller
and
blacker
stroke
a
variation
in
the
terminals
of
the
letters
it
is
hard
to
particularize
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
the
library
going
out
for
dinner
of
course
but
returning
to
my
refuge
again
immediately
after
only
in
the
library
am
i
safe
from
maggie
by
virtue
of
her
responsibility
for
my
wardrobe
she
virtually
shares
my
bedroom
but
her
respect
for
books
she
never
reads
makes
her
regard
a
library
as
at
least
ground
she
dusts
books
with
more
caution
than
china
and
her
respect
for
a
family
bible
is
greater
than
her
respect
for
me
i
spent
the
evening
there
miss
emily
cat
on
the
divan
and
the
mysterious
confession
lying
before
me
under
the
lamp
at
night
the
variation
between
it
and
her
note
to
me
concerning
the
house
seemed
more
pronounced
the
note
looked
more
like
a
clumsy
imitation
of
miss
own
hand
or
perhaps
this
is
nearer
as
if
after
writing
in
a
certain
way
for
sixty
years
she
had
tried
to
change
her
style
all
my
logic
ended
in
one
conclusion
she
must
have
known
the
confession
was
there
therefore
the
chances
were
that
she
had
placed
it
there
but
it
was
not
so
simple
as
that
both
crime
and
confession
indicated
a
degree
of
impulse
that
miss
emily
did
not
possess
i
have
entirely
failed
with
my
picture
of
miss
emily
if
the
word
violence
can
be
associated
with
her
in
any
way
miss
emily
was
a
temple
clean
swept
cold
and
empty
she
never
acted
on
impulse
every
action
almost
every
word
seemed
the
result
of
thought
and
deliberation
yet
if
i
could
believe
my
eyes
five
years
before
she
had
killed
a
woman
in
this
very
house
possibly
in
the
very
room
in
which
i
was
then
sitting
i
find
on
looking
back
that
the
terror
must
have
left
me
that
day
it
had
for
so
many
weeks
been
so
much
a
part
of
my
daily
life
that
i
would
have
missed
it
had
it
not
been
for
this
new
and
engrossing
interest
i
remember
that
the
long
french
windows
of
the
library
reflected
the
room
like
mirrors
against
the
darkness
outside
and
that
once
i
thought
i
saw
a
shadowy
movement
in
one
of
them
as
though
a
figure
moved
behind
me
but
when
i
turned
sharply
there
was
no
one
there
and
maggie
proved
to
be
as
usual
after
nine
shut
away
upstairs
i
was
not
terrified
and
indeed
the
fear
never
returned
in
all
the
course
of
my
investigations
i
was
never
again
a
victim
of
the
unreasoning
fright
of
those
earlier
days
my
difficulty
was
that
i
was
asked
to
believe
the
unbelievable
it
was
impossible
to
reconstruct
in
that
quiet
house
a
scene
of
violence
it
was
equally
impossible
in
view
for
instance
of
that
calm
and
filial
inscription
in
the
history
of
bolivar
county
to
connect
miss
emily
with
it
she
had
killed
a
woman
forsooth
miss
emily
of
the
baby
afghans
of
the
weary
peddler
of
that
quiet
seat
in
the
church
yet
i
knew
now
that
miss
emily
knew
of
the
confession
knew
at
least
of
something
concealed
in
that
corner
of
the
rear
hall
which
housed
the
telephone
had
she
by
chance
an
enemy
who
would
have
done
this
thing
but
to
suspect
miss
emily
of
an
enemy
was
as
absurd
as
to
suspect
her
of
a
crime
i
was
completely
at
a
loss
when
i
put
out
the
lights
and
prepared
to
close
the
house
as
i
glanced
back
along
the
hall
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
the
telephone
having
given
up
its
secret
would
continue
its
nocturnal
alarms
as
i
stood
there
i
heard
the
low
growl
of
thunder
and
the
patter
of
rain
against
the
windows
partly
out
of
loneliness
partly
out
of
bravado
i
went
back
to
the
telephone
and
tried
to
call
willie
but
the
line
was
out
of
order
i
slept
badly
shortly
after
i
returned
i
heard
a
door
slamming
repeatedly
which
i
knew
meant
an
open
window
somewhere
i
got
up
and
went
into
the
hall
there
was
a
cold
air
coming
from
somewhere
below
but
as
i
stood
there
it
ceased
the
door
above
stopped
slamming
and
silence
reigned
again
maggie
roused
me
early
the
morning
sunlight
was
just
creeping
into
the
room
and
the
air
was
still
cool
with
the
night
and
by
the
storm
miss
agnes
she
demanded
standing
over
me
did
you
let
the
cat
out
last
night
i
brought
him
in
before
i
went
to
bed
humph
said
maggie
and
did
i
or
did
i
not
wash
the
doorstep
yesterday
you
ought
to
know
you
said
you
did
miss
agnes
maggie
said
that
woman
was
in
this
house
last
night
you
can
see
her
footprints
as
plain
as
day
on
the
doorstep
and
what
more
she
stole
the
cat
and
let
out
your
mother
paisley
shawl
which
statements
corrected
proved
to
be
true
my
old
paisley
shawl
was
gone
from
the
hallrack
and
unquestionably
the
cat
had
been
on
the
back
doorstep
that
morning
along
with
the
milk
bottles
moreover
one
of
my
fresh
candles
had
been
lighted
but
had
burned
for
only
a
moment
or
two
that
day
i
had
a
second
visit
from
young
martin
sprague
the
telephone
was
in
working
order
again
having
unaccountably
recovered
and
i
was
using
it
when
he
came
he
watched
me
quizzically
from
a
position
by
the
newelpost
as
i
rang
off
i
was
calling
miss
emily
benton
i
explained
but
she
is
still
troubled
with
telephobia
i
have
other
things
to
worry
me
martin
i
said
gravely
and
let
him
into
the
library
there
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
everything
i
omitted
nothing
the
fear
the
strange
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
the
gasping
breathing
over
it
the
night
before
miss
emily
visit
to
it
and
at
last
the
discovery
he
took
the
paper
when
i
offered
it
to
him
and
examined
it
carefully
by
a
window
then
he
stood
looking
out
and
whistling
reflectively
at
last
he
turned
back
to
the
room
it
an
unusual
story
he
said
but
if
you
give
me
a
little
time
i
explain
it
to
you
in
the
first
place
let
go
of
the
material
things
for
a
moment
and
let
deal
with
minds
and
emotions
you
a
sensitive
person
miss
agnes
you
catch
a
lot
of
impressions
that
pass
most
people
by
and
first
of
all
you
been
catching
fright
from
two
sources
two
sources
two
maggie
is
one
she
hates
the
country
she
is
afraid
of
old
houses
and
she
sees
in
this
house
only
the
ghosts
of
people
who
have
died
here
i
pay
no
attention
to
maggie
fears
you
only
think
that
but
to
go
further
you
have
been
receiving
waves
of
apprehension
from
another
source
from
the
little
lady
miss
emily
then
you
think
hold
on
he
said
smiling
i
think
she
wrote
that
confession
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
quite
sure
she
did
and
she
has
established
a
system
of
espionage
on
you
by
means
of
the
telephone
if
you
had
discovered
the
confession
she
knew
that
there
would
be
a
change
in
your
voice
in
your
manner
if
you
answered
very
quickly
as
though
you
had
been
near
the
instrument
perhaps
in
the
very
act
of
discovering
the
paper
do
you
get
it
and
ca
you
see
how
her
terror
affected
you
even
over
the
wire
do
you
think
that
if
thought
can
travel
untold
distances
fear
can
of
course
but
martin
i
exclaimed
little
miss
emily
a
murderess
he
threw
up
his
hands
certainly
not
he
said
you
a
shrewd
woman
miss
agnes
do
you
know
that
a
certain
type
of
woman
frequently
confesses
to
a
crime
she
never
committed
or
had
any
chance
of
committing
look
at
the
police
records
confessions
of
women
as
to
crimes
they
could
only
have
heard
of
through
the
newspapers
i
would
like
to
wager
that
if
we
had
the
newspapers
of
that
date
that
came
into
this
house
we
would
find
a
particularly
atrocious
and
mysterious
murder
being
featured
the
murder
of
a
woman
you
do
not
know
her
i
maintained
doggedly
and
drew
as
best
i
could
a
sketch
of
miss
emily
while
he
listened
attentively
a
pure
neurasthenic
type
was
his
comment
older
than
usual
but
that
is
accountable
by
the
sheltered
life
she
has
led
the
little
miss
emily
is
still
at
heart
a
girl
and
a
hysterical
girl
she
has
had
enough
trouble
to
develop
her
trouble
has
she
ever
had
a
genuine
emotion
look
at
this
house
she
nursed
an
old
father
in
it
a
bedridden
mother
a
paretic
brother
when
she
should
have
been
having
children
do
you
see
it
miss
agnes
all
her
emotions
have
had
to
be
mental
failing
them
outside
she
provided
them
for
herself
this
he
tapped
the
paper
in
his
hand
this
is
one
i
had
heard
of
people
confessing
to
crimes
they
had
never
committed
and
at
the
time
martin
sprague
at
least
partly
convinced
me
he
was
so
sure
of
himself
and
when
that
afternoon
he
telephoned
me
from
the
city
to
say
that
he
was
mailing
out
some
old
newspapers
i
knew
quite
well
what
he
had
found
i
thought
of
something
else
miss
agnes
he
said
if
you
look
it
up
you
will
probably
find
that
the
little
lady
had
had
either
a
shock
sometime
before
that
or
a
long
pull
of
nursing
something
anyhow
to
set
her
nervous
system
to
going
in
the
wrong
direction
late
that
afternoon
as
it
happened
i
was
enabled
to
learn
something
of
this
from
a
visiting
neighbor
and
once
again
i
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
he
might
be
right
the
neighbors
had
not
been
over
cordial
i
had
gathered
from
the
first
the
impression
that
the
members
of
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
congregation
did
not
fancy
an
interloper
among
the
sacred
relics
of
the
historian
of
bolivar
county
and
i
had
a
corroboration
of
that
impression
from
my
visitor
of
that
afternoon
a
graves
i
been
slow
in
coming
miss
blakiston
she
said
seating
herself
primly
i
do
suppose
you
can
understand
but
this
has
always
been
the
benton
place
and
it
seems
strange
to
us
to
see
new
faces
here
i
replied
with
some
asperity
that
i
had
not
been
anxious
to
take
the
house
but
that
miss
emily
had
been
so
insistent
that
i
had
finally
done
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
flashed
a
quick
glance
at
me
she
is
quite
the
most
loved
person
in
the
valley
she
said
and
she
loves
the
place
it
is
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
rented
the
house
she
is
far
from
comfortable
where
she
is
after
a
time
i
gathered
that
she
suspected
financial
stringency
as
the
cause
and
i
tried
to
set
her
mind
at
rest
it
can
not
be
money
i
said
the
rent
is
absurdly
low
the
agent
wished
her
to
ask
more
but
she
refused
she
sat
silent
for
a
time
pulling
at
the
fingers
of
her
white
silk
gloves
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
of
the
garden
but
before
she
left
she
returned
to
miss
emily
she
has
had
a
hard
life
in
a
way
she
said
it
is
only
five
years
since
she
buried
her
brother
and
her
father
not
long
before
that
she
has
broken
a
great
deal
since
then
not
that
the
brother
i
understand
he
was
a
great
care
graves
looked
about
the
room
its
shelves
piled
high
with
the
ecclesiastical
library
of
the
late
clergyman
it
was
not
only
that
she
said
when
he
was
all
right
he
was
an
atheist
imagine
in
this
house
he
had
the
most
terrible
books
miss
blakiston
and
of
course
when
a
man
believes
there
is
no
hereafter
he
is
apt
to
lead
a
wicked
life
there
is
nothing
to
hold
him
back
her
mind
was
on
miss
emily
and
her
problems
she
moved
abstractedly
toward
the
door
in
this
very
hall
she
said
i
helped
miss
emily
to
pack
all
his
books
into
a
box
and
we
sent
for
staley
the
hackman
at
the
station
you
know
and
he
dumped
the
whole
thing
into
the
river
we
went
away
with
him
and
how
she
cheered
up
when
it
was
done
martin
sprague
newspapers
arrived
the
next
morning
they
bore
a
date
of
two
days
before
the
date
of
the
confession
and
contained
rather
triumphantly
outlined
in
blue
pencil
full
details
of
the
murder
of
a
young
woman
by
some
unknown
assassin
it
had
been
a
grisly
crime
and
the
paper
was
filled
with
details
of
a
most
sensational
sort
had
i
been
asked
i
would
have
said
that
miss
emily
clear
slightly
upturned
eyes
had
never
glanced
beyond
the
merest
headlines
of
such
journalistic
reports
but
in
a
letter
martin
sprague
set
forth
a
precisely
opposite
view
you
will
probably
find
he
wrote
that
the
little
lady
is
pretty
well
fed
up
on
such
stuff
the
calmer
and
more
placid
the
daily
life
the
more
apt
is
the
secret
inner
one
in
such
a
circumscribed
existence
to
be
a
thriller
you
might
look
over
the
books
in
the
house
there
is
a
historic
case
where
a
young
girl
swore
she
had
tossed
her
little
brother
to
a
den
of
lions
although
there
were
no
lions
near
and
little
brother
was
subsequently
found
asleep
in
the
attic
after
reading
fox
book
of
martyrs
probably
the
old
gentleman
has
this
joke
book
in
his
library
i
put
down
his
letter
and
glanced
around
the
room
was
he
right
after
all
did
women
rational
truthful
devout
women
ever
act
in
this
strange
manner
and
if
it
was
true
was
it
not
in
its
own
way
as
mysterious
as
everything
else
i
was
for
a
time
that
day
strongly
influenced
by
martin
conviction
it
was
for
one
thing
easier
to
believe
than
that
emily
benton
had
committed
a
crime
and
as
if
to
lend
color
to
his
assertion
the
sunlight
falling
onto
the
dreary
bookshelves
picked
out
and
illuminated
dull
gilt
letters
on
the
brown
back
of
a
volume
it
was
fox
book
of
martyrs
if
i
may
analyze
my
sensations
at
that
time
they
divided
themselves
into
three
parts
the
first
was
fear
that
seems
to
have
given
away
to
curiosity
and
that
at
a
later
period
to
an
intense
anxiety
of
the
three
i
have
no
excuse
for
the
second
save
the
one
i
gave
myself
at
the
time
that
miss
emily
could
not
possibly
have
done
the
thing
she
claimed
to
have
done
and
that
i
must
prove
her
innocence
to
myself
with
regard
to
martin
sprague
theory
i
was
divided
i
wanted
him
to
be
right
i
wanted
him
to
be
wrong
no
picture
i
could
visualize
of
little
old
miss
emily
conceivably
fitted
the
type
he
had
drawn
on
the
other
hand
nothing
about
her
could
possibly
confirm
the
confession
as
an
actual
one
the
scrap
of
paper
became
for
the
time
my
universe
did
i
close
my
eyes
i
saw
it
side
by
side
with
the
inscription
in
fifty
years
of
my
bolivar
county
and
letter
for
letter
in
the
same
hand
did
the
sun
shine
i
had
it
in
the
light
examining
it
reading
it
to
such
a
point
did
it
obsess
me
that
i
refused
to
allow
maggie
to
use
a
tablet
of
glazed
paper
she
had
found
in
the
kitchen
table
drawer
to
tie
up
the
it
seemed
somehow
horrible
to
me
at
that
time
i
had
no
thought
of
going
back
five
years
and
trying
to
trace
the
accuracy
or
falsehood
of
the
confession
i
should
not
have
known
how
to
go
about
it
had
such
a
crime
been
committed
how
to
discover
it
at
this
late
day
whom
in
all
her
sheltered
life
could
miss
emily
have
murdered
in
her
small
world
who
could
have
fallen
out
and
left
no
sign
it
was
impossible
and
i
knew
it
and
yet
miss
emily
was
ill
the
news
came
through
the
grocery
boy
who
came
out
every
day
on
a
bicycle
and
teased
the
cat
and
carried
away
all
the
pears
as
fast
as
they
ripened
maggie
brought
me
the
information
at
luncheon
she
sick
she
said
there
was
only
one
person
in
both
our
minds
those
days
do
you
mean
really
ill
or
only
the
boy
says
she
breaking
up
if
you
ask
me
she
caught
cold
the
night
she
broke
in
here
and
took
your
paisley
shawl
and
if
you
ask
my
advice
miss
agnes
you
get
it
back
again
before
the
heirs
step
in
and
claim
it
they
do
make
them
shawls
nowadays
and
she
as
like
as
not
to
will
it
to
somebody
if
you
do
go
after
it
maggie
i
said
quietly
how
do
you
know
she
has
that
shawl
how
did
i
know
that
paper
was
in
the
she
countered
and
indeed
by
that
time
maggie
had
convinced
herself
that
she
had
known
all
along
there
was
something
in
the
telephone
i
a
sort
of
second
sight
miss
agnes
she
added
and
with
a
shrewdness
i
found
later
was
partially
correct
she
was
snooping
around
to
see
if
you
found
that
paper
and
it
came
on
to
rain
so
she
took
the
shawl
i
should
say
said
maggie
lowering
her
voice
that
as
like
as
not
she
been
in
this
house
every
night
since
we
came
late
that
afternoon
i
cut
some
of
the
roses
from
the
arch
for
miss
emily
and
wrapping
them
against
the
sun
carried
them
to
the
village
at
the
last
i
hesitated
it
was
so
much
like
prying
i
turned
aside
at
the
church
intending
to
leave
them
there
for
the
altar
but
i
could
find
no
one
in
the
parish
house
and
no
vessel
to
hold
them
it
was
late
afternoon
i
opened
a
door
and
stepped
into
the
old
church
i
knelt
for
a
moment
and
then
sat
back
and
surveyed
the
quiet
building
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
one
could
obtain
a
real
conception
of
the
benton
family
and
of
miss
emily
the
church
had
been
the
realest
thing
in
their
lives
it
had
dominated
them
obsessed
them
when
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
died
they
had
built
him
not
a
monument
but
a
parish
house
when
carlo
benton
died
however
did
such
an
ungodly
name
come
to
belong
to
a
benton
miss
emily
according
to
the
story
had
done
without
fresh
mourning
and
built
him
a
window
i
looked
at
the
window
it
was
extremely
ugly
and
very
devout
and
under
it
was
the
dead
man
name
and
two
dates
and
so
carlo
benton
had
died
the
year
miss
emily
claimed
to
have
done
a
murder
another
proof
i
reflected
that
martin
sprague
would
say
he
had
been
on
her
hands
for
a
long
time
both
well
and
small
wonder
if
little
miss
emily
had
fallen
to
imagining
things
or
to
confessing
them
i
looked
at
the
memorial
window
once
more
and
i
could
almost
visualize
her
gathering
up
the
dead
man
hateful
books
and
getting
them
as
quickly
as
possible
out
of
the
house
quite
possibly
there
were
unmentionable
volumes
among
them
de
maupassant
perhaps
boccaccio
i
had
a
distinct
picture
too
of
graves
lips
primly
set
assisting
her
with
hands
that
fairly
itched
with
the
righteousness
of
her
actions
i
still
held
the
roses
and
as
i
left
the
church
i
decided
to
lay
them
on
some
grave
in
the
churchyard
i
thought
it
quite
likely
that
roses
from
the
same
arch
had
been
frequently
used
for
that
purpose
some
very
young
grave
i
said
to
myself
and
found
one
soon
enough
a
bit
of
a
rectangle
of
fresh
earth
and
a
jarful
of
pansies
on
it
it
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
benton
mausoleum
that
was
how
i
found
that
carlo
benton
had
died
on
the
of
may
i
can
not
claim
that
the
fact
at
the
time
had
any
significance
for
me
or
that
i
saw
in
it
anything
more
than
another
verification
of
martin
sprague
solution
but
it
enabled
me
to
reconstruct
the
benton
household
at
the
date
that
had
grown
so
significant
the
would
have
probably
been
the
day
after
the
funeral
perhaps
the
nurse
was
still
there
he
had
had
a
nurse
for
months
according
to
graves
and
there
would
have
been
the
airing
that
follows
long
illness
and
death
the
opened
windows
the
packing
up
or
giving
away
of
clothing
the
pauses
and
silences
the
sense
of
strangeness
and
quiet
the
lowered
voices
and
there
would
have
been
too
that
remorseless
packing
for
destruction
of
the
dead
atheist
books
and
some
time
during
that
day
or
the
night
that
followed
little
miss
emily
claimed
to
have
committed
her
crime
i
went
home
thoughtfully
at
the
gate
i
turned
and
looked
back
the
benton
mausoleum
was
warm
in
the
sunset
and
the
rose
sprays
lay
like
outstretched
arms
across
the
tiny
grave
maggie
is
amazingly
efficient
i
am
efficient
myself
i
trust
but
i
modify
it
with
intelligence
it
is
not
to
me
a
vital
matter
for
instance
if
three
dozen
glasses
of
jelly
sit
on
a
kitchen
table
a
day
or
two
after
they
are
prepared
for
retirement
to
the
fruit
cellar
i
rather
like
to
see
them
marshaled
in
their
neat
rows
capped
with
sealing
wax
and
paper
and
armed
with
labels
but
maggie
has
neither
sentiment
nor
imagination
jelly
to
her
is
an
institution
not
an
inspiration
it
is
subject
to
certain
rules
and
rites
of
which
not
the
least
is
the
formal
interment
in
the
fruit
closet
therefore
after
much
protesting
that
night
i
agreed
to
visit
the
fruit
cellar
and
select
a
spot
for
the
temporary
entombing
of
jelly
tumblers
which
would
have
been
had
delia
known
the
efficacy
of
a
silver
spoon
i
can
recall
vividly
the
mental
shift
from
the
confession
to
that
domestic
excursion
my
own
impatience
grim
determination
and
the
curious
denouement
of
that
visit
iii
i
had
the
very
slightest
acquaintance
with
the
basement
of
the
benton
house
i
knew
it
was
dry
and
orderly
and
with
that
my
interest
in
it
ceased
it
was
not
cemented
but
its
hard
clay
floor
was
almost
as
solid
as
macadam
in
one
end
was
built
a
high
in
another
corner
two
or
three
old
pews
from
the
church
evidently
long
discarded
and
showing
as
though
they
had
once
served
as
garden
benches
were
against
the
whitewashed
wall
the
built
in
of
lumber
occupied
one
entire
end
and
was
virtually
a
room
with
a
door
and
no
windows
maggie
had
she
said
found
it
locked
and
had
had
an
itinerant
locksmith
fit
a
key
to
it
it
all
scrubbed
and
ready
she
said
i
found
that
preserved
you
had
for
lunch
in
a
corner
of
kept
much
longer
so
i
took
it
up
and
opened
it
she
probably
got
all
sorts
of
stuff
spoiling
in
the
locked
part
some
folks
like
that
most
of
the
shelves
were
open
but
now
holding
the
lamp
high
i
saw
that
a
closet
with
a
door
occupied
one
end
the
door
was
padlocked
at
the
time
i
was
interested
but
i
was
as
i
remember
much
more
occupied
with
maggie
sense
of
meum
and
tuum
which
i
considered
deficient
and
of
a
small
lecture
on
other
people
melon
rinds
which
i
delivered
as
she
sullenly
put
away
the
jelly
but
that
night
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
the
memory
of
that
padlock
became
strangely
insistent
there
was
nothing
psychic
about
the
feeling
i
had
it
was
perfectly
obvious
and
simple
the
house
held
or
had
held
a
secret
yet
it
was
above
stairs
as
open
as
the
day
there
was
no
corner
into
which
i
might
not
peer
except
why
was
that
portion
of
the
locked
at
two
finding
myself
unable
to
sleep
i
got
up
and
put
on
my
and
slippers
i
had
refused
to
repeat
the
experiment
of
being
locked
in
then
with
a
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
i
went
downstairs
i
had
as
i
have
said
no
longer
any
terror
of
the
lower
floor
the
cat
lay
as
usual
on
the
table
in
the
back
hall
i
saw
his
eyes
watching
me
with
their
curious
unblinking
stare
as
intelligent
as
two
brass
buttons
he
rose
as
my
light
approached
and
i
made
a
bed
for
him
of
a
cushion
from
a
chair
failing
my
paisley
shawl
it
was
after
that
that
i
had
the
curious
sense
of
being
led
it
was
as
though
i
knew
that
something
awaited
my
discovery
and
that
my
sole
volition
was
whether
i
should
make
that
discovery
or
not
it
was
there
waiting
i
have
no
explanation
for
this
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
i
might
have
had
it
to
find
at
the
end
nothing
more
significant
than
for
instance
or
bulbs
for
the
winter
garden
and
indeed
at
first
sight
what
awaited
me
in
the
locked
closet
amounted
to
for
when
i
had
broken
the
rusty
padlock
open
with
a
hatchet
and
had
opened
doors
with
nervous
fingers
nothing
more
startling
appeared
than
a
number
of
books
the
shelves
were
piled
high
with
them
a
motley
crew
of
all
colors
but
dark
shades
predominating
i
went
back
to
bed
sheepishly
enough
and
wrapped
my
chilled
feet
in
an
extra
blanket
maggie
came
to
the
door
about
the
time
i
was
dozing
off
and
said
she
had
heard
hammering
downstairs
in
the
cellar
some
time
ago
but
she
had
refused
to
waken
me
until
the
burglars
had
gone
if
it
was
burglars
she
added
you
that
miss
agnes
that
i
knew
if
i
waked
you
you
be
downstairs
after
them
what
a
bit
of
silver
to
a
human
life
i
got
her
away
at
last
and
she
went
muttering
something
about
digging
up
the
cellar
floor
and
finding
an
uneasy
spirit
then
i
fell
asleep
i
had
taken
cold
that
night
and
the
following
morning
i
spent
in
bed
at
noon
maggie
came
upstairs
holding
at
arm
length
a
book
she
kept
her
face
averted
and
gave
me
a
slanting
and
outraged
glance
this
is
a
nice
place
we
come
to
she
said
acidly
murder
in
the
telephone
and
in
the
fruit
cellar
why
maggie
i
expostulated
if
these
books
stay
i
go
and
that
flat
miss
agnes
was
her
ipse
dixit
she
dropped
the
book
on
the
bed
and
stalked
out
pausing
at
the
door
only
to
throw
back
if
this
is
a
clergyman
house
i
guess
i
be
better
out
of
the
church
i
took
up
the
book
it
was
and
in
the
front
in
a
heavy
masculine
hand
the
owner
had
written
his
name
written
it
large
a
bit
defiantly
perhaps
it
had
taken
both
courage
and
conviction
to
bring
such
a
book
into
that
devout
household
i
am
not
quick
mentally
especially
when
it
comes
to
logical
thought
i
daresay
i
am
intuitive
rather
than
logical
it
was
not
by
any
process
of
reasoning
at
all
i
fancy
that
it
suddenly
seemed
strange
that
there
should
be
books
locked
away
in
the
cellar
yet
it
was
strange
for
that
had
been
a
bookish
household
books
were
its
stock
in
trade
one
may
say
such
as
i
had
borrowed
from
the
library
had
been
carefully
tended
torn
leaves
were
neatly
repaired
the
reference
books
were
alphabetically
arranged
and
looking
back
on
my
visit
to
the
cellar
i
recalled
now
as
inconsistent
the
disorder
of
those
basement
shelves
i
did
not
reach
the
truth
until
that
afternoon
i
made
a
second
visit
to
the
cellar
graves
had
been
mistaken
if
not
all
carlo
proscribed
books
were
hidden
there
at
least
a
large
portion
of
his
library
was
piled
in
something
like
confusion
on
the
shelves
yet
she
maintained
that
they
had
searched
the
house
and
she
herself
had
been
present
when
the
books
were
packed
and
taken
away
to
the
river
that
afternoon
i
returned
graves
visit
she
was
at
home
and
in
a
sort
of
flurried
neatness
that
convinced
me
she
had
seen
me
from
far
up
the
road
that
conviction
was
increased
by
the
amazing
promptness
with
which
a
followed
my
entrance
i
had
given
her
tea
the
day
she
came
to
see
me
and
she
was
not
to
be
outdone
indeed
i
somehow
gained
the
impression
that
tray
and
teapot
and
even
little
cakes
had
been
waiting
day
by
day
for
my
anticipated
visit
it
was
not
hard
to
set
her
talking
of
carlo
benton
and
his
wickedness
she
rose
to
the
bait
like
a
hungry
fish
yet
i
gathered
that
beyond
his
religious
views
or
lack
of
them
she
knew
nothing
but
on
the
matter
of
the
books
she
was
firm
after
the
box
was
ready
she
said
we
went
to
every
room
and
searched
it
miss
emily
was
set
on
clearing
out
every
trace
at
the
last
minute
i
found
one
called
fallacy
of
christianity
slipped
down
behind
the
dresser
in
his
room
and
we
put
that
in
it
was
the
fallacy
of
christianity
that
maggie
had
brought
me
that
morning
it
is
a
most
interesting
story
i
observed
what
delicious
tea
graves
and
then
you
fastened
up
the
box
and
saw
it
thrown
into
the
river
it
was
quite
a
ceremony
my
dear
graves
said
solemnly
it
was
not
a
ceremony
it
was
a
rite
a
significant
rite
how
can
i
reconcile
the
thoughts
i
had
that
afternoon
with
my
later
visit
to
miss
emily
the
little
upper
room
in
the
village
dominated
and
almost
filled
by
an
bed
and
miss
emily
frail
and
delicate
and
beautifully
neat
propped
with
pillows
and
holding
a
fine
handkerchief
as
fresh
as
the
flutings
of
her
small
cap
in
her
hand
on
a
small
stand
beside
the
bed
were
her
bible
her
spectacles
and
her
quaint
gold
watch
and
miss
emily
herself
she
was
altered
shockingly
altered
a
certain
tenseness
had
gone
a
tenseness
that
had
seemed
to
uphold
her
frail
body
and
carry
her
about
only
her
eyes
seemed
greatly
alive
and
before
i
left
they
too
had
ceased
their
searching
of
mine
and
looked
weary
and
old
and
at
the
end
of
my
short
visit
i
had
reluctantly
reached
this
conclusion
either
miss
emily
had
done
the
thing
she
confessed
to
doing
incredible
as
it
might
appear
or
she
thought
she
had
done
it
and
the
thing
was
killing
her
she
knew
i
had
found
the
confession
i
knew
that
it
was
written
large
over
her
what
she
had
expected
me
to
do
god
only
knows
to
stand
up
and
denounce
her
to
summon
the
law
i
do
not
know
she
said
an
extraordinary
thing
when
at
last
i
rose
to
go
i
believe
now
that
it
was
to
give
me
my
chance
to
speak
probably
she
found
the
suspense
intolerable
but
i
could
not
do
it
i
was
too
surprised
too
perplexed
too
well
afraid
of
hurting
her
i
had
the
feeling
i
know
that
i
must
protect
her
and
that
feeling
never
left
me
until
the
end
i
think
you
must
know
my
dear
she
said
from
her
pillows
that
i
have
your
paisley
shawl
i
was
breathless
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
stumbled
it
was
raining
that
night
she
said
in
her
soft
delicate
voice
i
have
had
it
dried
and
pressed
it
is
not
hurt
i
thought
you
would
not
mind
she
concluded
it
does
not
matter
at
all
not
in
the
least
i
said
unhappily
i
am
quite
sure
now
that
she
meant
me
to
speak
then
i
can
recall
the
way
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
serene
and
expectant
she
was
waiting
but
to
save
my
life
i
could
not
and
she
did
not
had
she
gone
as
far
as
she
had
the
strength
to
go
or
was
this
again
one
of
those
curious
pacts
of
hers
if
i
spoke
or
was
silent
it
was
to
be
i
do
not
know
i
do
know
that
we
were
both
silent
and
that
at
last
with
a
quick
breath
she
reached
out
and
thumped
on
the
floor
with
a
cane
that
stood
beside
the
bed
until
a
girl
came
running
up
from
below
stairs
get
the
shawl
fanny
dear
said
miss
emily
and
wrap
it
up
for
miss
blakiston
i
wanted
desperately
while
the
girl
left
the
room
to
obey
to
say
something
helpful
something
reassuring
but
i
could
not
my
voice
failed
me
and
miss
emily
did
not
give
me
another
opportunity
she
thanked
me
rather
formally
for
the
flowers
i
had
brought
from
her
garden
and
let
me
go
at
last
with
the
parcel
under
my
arm
without
further
reference
to
it
the
situation
was
incredible
somehow
i
had
the
feeling
that
miss
emily
would
never
reopen
the
subject
again
she
had
given
me
my
chance
at
who
knows
what
cost
and
i
had
not
taken
it
there
had
been
something
in
her
i
can
not
find
words
for
it
but
it
was
perhaps
a
finality
an
effect
of
a
closed
door
that
i
felt
without
being
able
to
analyze
i
walked
back
to
the
house
refusing
the
offices
of
staley
who
met
me
on
the
road
i
needed
to
think
but
thinking
took
me
nowhere
only
one
conclusion
stood
out
as
a
result
of
a
mile
and
a
half
of
mental
struggle
something
must
be
done
miss
emily
ought
to
be
helped
she
was
under
a
strain
that
was
killing
her
but
to
help
i
should
know
the
facts
only
were
there
any
facts
to
know
suppose
just
by
way
of
argument
for
i
did
not
believe
it
that
the
confession
was
true
how
could
i
find
out
anything
about
it
five
years
was
a
long
time
i
could
not
go
to
the
neighbors
they
were
none
too
friendly
as
it
was
besides
the
secret
if
there
was
one
was
not
mine
but
was
miss
emily
i
reached
home
at
last
and
smuggled
the
shawl
into
the
house
i
had
no
intention
of
explaining
its
return
to
maggie
yet
small
as
it
was
in
its
way
it
offered
a
problem
at
once
for
maggie
has
a
penetrating
eye
and
an
inquiring
nature
i
finally
decided
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
hang
it
in
its
accustomed
place
in
the
hall
where
maggie
finding
it
at
nine
that
evening
set
up
such
a
series
of
shrieks
and
exclamations
as
surpassed
even
her
own
record
i
knitted
that
evening
it
has
been
my
custom
for
years
to
knit
for
an
old
ladies
home
in
which
i
am
interested
because
i
can
work
at
them
with
my
eyes
shut
through
long
practise
i
find
the
work
soothing
so
that
evening
i
knitted
at
eliza
klinordlinger
fifth
annual
right
slipper
and
tried
to
develop
a
course
of
action
i
began
with
a
major
premise
to
regard
the
confession
as
a
real
one
until
it
was
proved
otherwise
granted
then
that
my
little
old
miss
emily
had
killed
a
woman
who
was
the
woman
where
is
the
body
what
was
the
reason
for
the
crime
question
two
i
had
a
tentative
answer
for
however
horrible
and
incredible
it
seemed
it
was
at
least
possible
that
miss
emily
had
substituted
the
body
for
the
books
and
that
what
graves
described
as
a
rite
had
indeed
been
one
but
that
brought
up
a
picture
i
could
not
face
and
yet
i
called
up
the
local
physician
a
doctor
lingard
that
night
and
asked
him
about
miss
emily
condition
he
was
quite
frank
with
me
it
just
a
breaking
up
he
said
it
has
come
early
because
she
has
had
a
trying
life
and
more
responsibility
than
she
should
have
had
i
have
been
wondering
if
a
change
of
scene
would
not
be
a
good
thing
i
suggested
but
he
was
almost
scornful
change
he
said
i
been
after
her
to
get
away
for
years
she
leave
i
do
believe
she
has
been
twelve
miles
away
in
thirty
years
i
suppose
her
brother
was
a
great
care
i
observed
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
doctor
hearty
voice
was
a
trifle
less
frank
when
he
replied
but
when
i
rang
off
i
told
myself
that
i
too
was
becoming
neurasthenic
and
suspicious
i
had
however
learned
what
i
had
wanted
to
know
miss
emily
had
had
no
life
outside
bolivar
county
the
place
to
look
for
her
story
was
here
in
the
immediate
vicinity
that
night
i
made
a
second
visit
to
the
basement
it
seemed
to
me
with
those
chaotic
shelves
before
me
that
something
of
the
haste
and
terror
of
a
night
five
years
before
came
back
to
me
a
night
when
confronted
by
the
necessity
for
concealing
a
crime
the
box
upstairs
had
been
hurriedly
unpacked
its
contents
hidden
here
and
locked
away
and
some
other
content
inert
and
heavy
had
taken
the
place
of
the
books
miss
emily
in
her
high
bed
her
bible
and
spectacles
on
the
stand
beside
her
her
starched
pillows
her
soft
and
highbred
voice
or
another
miss
emily
panting
and
carrying
down
her
armfuls
of
forbidden
books
her
slight
figure
bent
under
their
weight
her
ears
open
for
sounds
from
the
silent
house
or
that
third
miss
emily
martin
sprague
a
strange
wild
creature
neither
sane
nor
insane
building
a
crime
out
of
the
fabric
of
a
nightmare
which
was
the
real
emily
benton
or
was
there
another
contingency
that
i
had
not
thought
of
had
some
secret
enemy
of
miss
emily
some
hysterical
girl
from
the
parish
suffering
under
a
fancied
slight
or
some
dismissed
and
revengeful
servant
taken
this
strange
method
of
retaliation
done
it
and
then
warned
the
little
old
lady
that
her
house
contained
such
a
paper
i
confess
that
this
last
thought
took
hold
on
me
it
offered
a
way
out
that
i
clutched
at
i
had
an
almost
frantic
feeling
by
that
time
that
i
must
know
the
truth
suspense
was
weighing
on
me
and
maggie
never
slow
to
voice
an
unpleasant
truth
said
that
night
as
she
brought
the
carafe
of
to
the
library
you
going
off
the
last
few
days
miss
agnes
and
when
i
made
no
reply
you
sagging
around
the
chin
there
nothing
shows
age
like
the
chin
if
you
rub
a
little
on
at
night
you
tighten
up
some
i
ignored
her
elaborately
but
i
knew
she
was
right
heat
and
sleepless
nights
and
those
early
days
of
fear
had
told
on
me
and
although
i
usually
disregard
maggie
cosmetic
suggestions
culled
from
the
beauty
columns
of
the
evening
paper
a
look
in
the
mirror
decided
me
i
went
downstairs
for
the
lemon
at
least
i
thought
it
was
for
the
lemon
i
am
not
sure
i
have
come
to
be
uncertain
of
my
motives
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
i
was
making
for
the
cellar
all
the
time
i
only
know
that
i
landed
there
with
a
lemon
in
my
hand
at
something
after
eleven
the
books
were
piled
in
disorder
on
the
shelves
their
five
years
of
burial
had
not
hurt
them
beyond
a
slight
dampness
of
the
leaves
no
hand
i
believe
had
touched
them
since
they
were
taken
from
the
box
where
graves
had
helped
to
pack
them
then
if
i
were
shrewd
i
should
perhaps
gather
something
from
their
very
disorder
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
not
i
would
quite
certainly
have
gone
away
as
i
came
clueless
had
i
not
attempted
to
straighten
a
pile
of
books
dangerously
sagging
like
my
chin
and
threatening
a
fall
my
effort
was
rewarded
by
a
veritable
niagara
of
books
they
poured
over
the
edge
a
few
first
then
more
until
i
stood
it
seemed
in
a
raging
sea
of
atheism
somewhat
grimly
i
set
to
work
to
repair
the
damage
and
one
by
one
i
picked
them
up
and
restored
them
i
put
them
in
methodically
this
time
glancing
at
each
title
to
place
the
volume
upright
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
of
unbelief
a
title
caught
my
eye
and
held
it
the
handwriting
of
god
i
knew
the
book
it
had
fallen
into
bad
company
but
its
theology
was
unimpeachable
it
did
not
belong
it
i
opened
it
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
had
written
his
own
name
in
it
in
the
cramped
hand
i
had
grown
to
know
evidently
its
presence
there
was
accidental
i
turned
it
over
in
my
hands
and
saw
that
it
was
closed
down
on
something
on
several
things
indeed
they
proved
to
be
a
small
black
a
pair
of
spectacles
a
woman
handkerchief
i
stood
there
looking
at
them
they
might
mean
nothing
but
the
accidental
closing
of
a
book
which
was
mistakenly
placed
in
bad
company
perhaps
by
graves
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
her
knowledge
of
religious
literature
or
they
might
mean
something
more
something
i
had
feared
to
find
armed
with
the
volume
and
the
lemon
forgotten
where
the
cook
found
it
the
next
day
and
made
much
of
the
mystery
i
went
upstairs
again
viewed
in
a
strong
light
the
three
articles
took
on
real
significance
the
spectacles
i
fancied
were
miss
emily
they
were
to
all
appearances
the
duplicates
of
those
on
her
tidy
bedside
stand
but
the
handkerchief
was
not
hers
even
without
the
scent
which
had
left
it
but
clung
obstinately
to
the
pages
of
the
book
i
knew
it
was
not
hers
it
was
florid
embroidered
and
cheap
and
held
close
to
the
light
i
made
out
a
in
ink
on
the
border
the
name
was
either
wright
or
knight
the
was
an
old
one
and
covered
a
period
of
almost
twenty
years
it
contained
dates
and
cash
entries
the
entries
were
nearly
all
in
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
hand
but
after
the
date
of
his
death
they
had
been
continued
in
miss
emily
writing
they
varied
little
save
that
the
amounts
gradually
increased
toward
the
end
and
the
dates
were
further
apart
thus
in
there
were
six
entries
aggregating
five
hundred
dollars
in
there
were
no
entries
at
all
but
in
there
was
a
single
memorandum
of
a
thousand
dollars
the
entire
amount
must
have
been
close
to
thousand
dollars
there
was
nothing
to
show
whether
it
was
money
saved
or
money
spent
money
paid
out
or
come
in
but
across
the
years
and
the
reverend
thaddeus
had
written
diagonally
the
word
australia
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
enlightenment
there
carlo
benton
had
been
in
australia
during
those
years
in
his
fifty
years
in
bolivar
county
the
father
had
rather
naively
quoted
a
letter
from
carlo
benton
in
melbourne
a
record
then
in
all
probability
of
sums
paid
by
this
harassed
old
man
to
a
worthless
son
only
the
handkerchief
refused
to
be
accounted
for
i
did
not
sleep
that
night
more
and
more
as
i
lay
through
the
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
miss
emily
must
be
helped
that
she
was
drifting
miserably
out
of
life
for
need
of
a
helping
hand
once
toward
morning
i
dozed
off
to
waken
in
a
state
of
terror
that
i
recognized
as
a
return
of
the
old
fear
but
it
left
me
soon
although
i
lay
awake
until
morning
that
day
i
made
two
resolves
to
send
for
willie
and
to
make
a
determined
effort
to
see
the
night
my
letter
to
willie
off
i
tried
to
fill
the
day
until
the
hour
when
the
night
was
up
and
about
late
in
the
afternoon
the
delay
was
simplified
by
the
arrival
of
graves
in
white
silk
gloves
and
a
black
cotton
umbrella
as
a
sunshade
she
had
lost
her
air
of
being
afraid
i
might
patronize
her
and
explained
pantingly
that
she
had
come
on
an
errand
not
to
call
i
at
my
christmas
presents
now
she
said
and
i
fixed
on
a
bedroom
set
for
miss
emily
i
suppose
you
wo
care
if
i
go
right
up
and
measure
the
will
you
i
took
her
up
and
her
sharp
eyes
roved
over
the
stairs
and
the
upper
hall
that
where
carlo
died
she
said
it
never
been
used
since
unless
you
she
had
paused
staring
into
miss
emily
deserted
bedroom
it
a
good
thing
i
came
she
said
the
eye
no
use
to
trust
to
especially
for
bureaus
she
looked
around
the
room
there
was
at
that
moment
something
tender
about
her
she
even
lowered
her
voice
and
softened
it
it
took
on
almost
comically
the
refinements
of
miss
emily
own
speech
whose
photograph
is
that
she
asked
suddenly
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
it
before
but
it
looks
familiar
too
she
reflected
before
it
it
was
clear
that
she
felt
a
sort
of
resentment
at
not
recognizing
the
young
and
smiling
woman
in
the
old
walnut
frame
but
a
moment
later
she
was
measuring
the
her
mind
set
on
christmas
benevolence
however
before
she
went
out
she
paused
near
the
photograph
it
queer
she
said
i
been
in
this
room
about
a
thousand
times
and
i
never
noticed
it
before
i
suppose
you
can
get
so
accustomed
to
a
thing
that
you
do
notice
it
as
she
went
out
she
turned
to
me
and
i
gathered
that
not
only
the
measurement
for
a
gift
had
brought
her
that
afternoon
about
those
books
she
said
i
run
on
a
lot
when
i
get
to
talking
i
suppose
i
should
have
mentioned
them
but
i
sure
you
keep
the
story
to
yourself
i
never
even
told
mr
graves
of
course
i
shall
i
assured
her
but
did
the
hackman
see
you
packing
the
books
no
indeed
we
packed
them
the
afternoon
after
the
funeral
and
it
was
the
next
day
that
staley
took
them
off
he
thought
it
was
old
bedding
and
so
on
and
he
hinted
to
have
it
given
to
him
so
miss
emily
and
i
went
along
to
see
it
was
done
right
so
i
discovered
that
the
box
had
sat
overnight
in
the
benton
house
there
remained
if
i
was
to
help
miss
emily
to
discover
what
had
occurred
in
those
dark
hours
when
the
books
were
taken
out
and
something
else
substituted
the
total
result
of
my
conversation
that
afternoon
on
the
front
porch
of
the
small
frame
house
on
a
side
street
with
the
night
was
additional
mystery
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
i
had
anticipated
resentment
and
possibly
insolence
but
i
had
not
expected
to
find
fright
yet
the
girl
was
undeniably
frightened
i
had
hardly
told
her
the
object
of
my
visit
before
i
realized
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
almost
panic
you
can
understand
how
i
feel
i
said
i
have
no
desire
to
report
the
matter
of
course
but
some
one
has
been
calling
the
house
repeatedly
at
night
listening
until
i
reply
and
then
hanging
up
the
receiver
it
is
not
accidental
it
has
happened
too
often
i
not
supposed
to
give
out
information
about
calls
but
just
think
a
moment
i
went
on
suppose
some
one
is
planning
to
rob
the
house
and
using
this
method
of
finding
out
if
we
are
there
or
not
i
do
remember
anything
about
the
calls
you
are
talking
about
she
parried
without
looking
at
me
as
busy
as
i
am
nonsense
i
put
in
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
am
talking
about
how
do
i
know
but
that
it
is
the
intention
of
some
one
to
lure
me
downstairs
to
the
telephone
and
then
murder
me
i
am
sure
it
is
not
that
she
said
for
almost
the
first
time
she
looked
directly
at
me
and
i
caught
a
flash
of
something
not
defiance
it
was
indeed
rather
like
reassurance
you
see
you
know
it
is
not
that
i
felt
all
at
once
that
she
did
know
who
was
calling
me
at
night
and
why
and
moreover
that
she
would
not
tell
if
as
i
suspected
it
was
miss
emily
this
girl
must
be
to
some
extent
in
her
confidence
but
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
think
i
know
who
is
calling
me
i
hesitated
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
an
amiable
face
and
more
than
a
suggestion
of
good
breeding
and
intelligence
about
her
i
made
a
quick
resolve
to
appeal
to
her
my
dear
child
i
said
i
want
so
very
much
if
i
can
to
help
some
one
who
is
in
trouble
but
before
i
can
help
i
must
know
that
i
can
help
and
i
must
be
sure
it
is
necessary
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about
why
do
you
go
back
to
the
city
she
said
suddenly
go
away
and
forget
all
about
us
here
that
would
help
more
than
anything
but
would
it
i
asked
gently
would
my
going
away
help
her
to
my
absolute
amazement
she
began
to
cry
we
had
been
sitting
on
a
cheap
porch
seat
side
by
side
and
she
turned
her
back
to
me
and
put
her
head
against
the
arm
of
the
bench
she
going
to
die
she
said
shakily
she
weaker
every
day
she
is
slipping
away
and
no
one
does
anything
but
i
got
nothing
more
from
her
she
had
understood
me
it
was
clear
and
when
at
last
she
stopped
crying
she
knew
well
enough
that
she
had
betrayed
her
understanding
but
she
would
not
talk
i
felt
that
she
was
not
unfriendly
and
that
she
was
uncertain
rather
than
stubborn
in
the
end
i
got
up
little
better
off
than
when
i
came
i
give
you
time
to
think
it
over
i
said
not
so
much
about
the
telephone
calls
because
you
really
answered
that
but
about
miss
emily
she
needs
help
and
i
want
to
help
her
but
you
tie
my
hands
she
had
a
sort
of
gift
for
silence
as
i
grew
later
on
to
know
anne
bullard
better
i
realized
that
even
more
so
now
she
sat
silent
and
let
me
talk
what
i
want
i
said
is
to
have
miss
emily
know
that
i
am
friendly
that
i
am
willing
to
do
anything
to
to
show
my
friendliness
anything
you
see
she
said
with
a
kind
of
dogged
patience
it
is
really
up
to
you
or
to
me
either
it
something
else
she
hesitated
very
obstinate
she
added
when
i
went
away
i
was
aware
that
her
eyes
followed
me
anxious
and
thoughtful
eyes
with
something
of
miss
emily
own
gaze
willie
came
late
the
next
evening
i
had
indeed
gone
to
retire
when
i
heard
his
car
in
the
drive
when
i
admitted
him
he
drew
me
into
the
library
and
gave
me
a
good
looking
over
as
i
thought
he
said
nerves
gone
looks
gone
i
told
you
maggie
would
put
a
curse
on
you
what
is
it
so
i
told
him
the
telephone
he
already
knew
about
the
confession
he
read
over
twice
and
then
observed
characteristically
that
he
would
be
eternally
i
think
the
word
is
hornswoggled
when
i
brought
out
the
handwriting
of
god
following
story
of
the
books
he
looked
thoughtful
and
indeed
by
the
end
of
the
recital
he
was
very
grave
sprague
is
a
lunatic
he
said
with
conviction
there
was
a
body
and
it
went
into
the
river
in
the
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
this
knight
or
wright
woman
who
owned
the
handkerchief
was
the
victim
however
that
for
later
on
the
plain
truth
is
that
there
was
a
murder
and
that
miss
emily
is
shielding
some
one
else
and
after
all
that
was
the
only
immediate
result
of
willie
visit
a
new
theory
so
that
now
it
stood
there
was
a
crime
there
was
no
crime
miss
emily
had
committed
it
miss
emily
had
not
committed
it
miss
emily
had
confessed
it
but
some
one
else
had
committed
it
for
a
few
hours
however
our
attention
was
distracted
from
miss
emily
and
her
concerns
by
the
attempted
robbery
of
the
house
that
night
i
knew
nothing
of
it
until
i
heard
willie
shouting
downstairs
i
was
deeply
asleep
relaxed
no
doubt
by
the
consciousness
that
at
last
there
was
a
man
in
the
house
and
indeed
maggie
slept
for
the
same
reason
through
the
entire
occurrence
stop
or
i
fire
willie
repeated
as
i
sat
up
in
bed
i
knew
quite
well
that
he
had
no
weapon
there
was
not
one
in
the
house
but
the
next
moment
there
was
a
loud
report
either
a
door
slamming
or
a
and
i
ran
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
there
was
no
light
below
but
a
current
of
cool
night
air
came
up
the
staircase
and
suddenly
i
realized
that
there
was
complete
silence
in
the
house
willie
i
cried
out
in
an
agony
of
fright
but
he
did
not
reply
and
then
suddenly
the
telephone
rang
i
did
not
answer
it
i
know
now
why
it
rang
that
there
was
real
anxiety
behind
its
summons
but
i
hardly
heard
it
then
i
was
convinced
that
willie
had
been
shot
i
must
have
gone
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
and
at
the
foot
i
ran
directly
into
willie
he
was
standing
there
only
a
deeper
shadow
in
the
blackness
and
i
had
placed
my
hand
over
his
as
it
lay
on
the
before
he
knew
i
was
on
the
staircase
he
wheeled
sharply
and
i
felt
to
my
surprise
that
he
held
a
revolver
in
his
hand
willie
what
is
it
i
said
in
a
low
tone
he
whispered
do
move
or
speak
we
listened
standing
together
there
were
undoubtedly
sounds
outside
some
one
moving
about
a
hand
on
a
and
finally
not
particularly
cautious
steps
at
the
front
door
it
swung
open
i
could
hear
it
creak
as
it
moved
slowly
on
its
hinges
i
put
a
hand
out
to
steady
myself
by
the
comfort
of
willie
presence
before
me
between
me
and
that
door
but
willie
was
moving
forward
crouched
down
i
fancied
and
the
memory
of
that
revolver
terrified
me
do
shoot
him
willie
i
almost
shrieked
shoot
whom
said
willie
cool
voice
just
inside
the
door
i
knew
then
and
i
went
sick
all
over
somewhere
in
the
hall
between
us
crouched
the
man
i
had
taken
for
willie
crouched
with
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
the
door
was
still
open
i
knew
and
i
could
hear
willie
fumbling
on
the
for
matches
i
called
out
something
incoherent
about
not
striking
a
light
but
willie
whistling
softly
to
show
how
cool
he
was
struck
a
match
it
was
followed
instantly
by
a
report
and
i
closed
my
eyes
when
i
opened
them
willie
was
standing
unhurt
staring
over
the
burning
match
at
the
door
which
was
closed
and
i
knew
that
the
report
had
been
but
the
bang
of
the
heavy
door
what
in
blazes
slammed
that
door
he
said
the
burglar
or
whatever
he
is
i
said
my
voice
trembling
in
spite
of
me
he
was
here
in
front
of
me
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
he
had
a
revolver
in
it
when
you
opened
the
door
he
slipped
out
past
you
willie
muttered
something
and
went
toward
the
door
a
moment
later
i
was
alone
again
and
the
telephone
was
ringing
i
felt
my
way
back
along
the
hall
i
touched
the
cat
which
had
been
sleeping
on
the
he
merely
turned
over
i
have
tried
in
living
that
night
over
again
to
record
things
as
they
impressed
me
for
after
all
this
is
a
narrative
of
motive
rather
than
of
incidents
of
emotions
as
against
deeds
but
at
the
time
the
brief
conversation
over
the
telephone
seemed
to
me
both
horrible
and
unnatural
from
a
great
distance
a
woman
voice
said
is
anything
wrong
there
that
was
the
first
question
and
i
felt
quite
sure
that
it
was
the
bullard
girl
voice
that
is
looking
back
from
the
safety
of
the
next
day
i
so
decided
at
the
time
i
had
no
thought
whatever
there
is
nothing
wrong
i
replied
i
do
not
know
why
i
said
it
surely
there
was
enough
wrong
with
willie
chasing
an
armed
intruder
through
the
garden
i
thought
the
connection
had
been
cut
for
there
was
a
buzzing
on
the
wire
but
a
second
or
so
later
there
came
an
entirely
different
voice
one
i
had
never
heard
before
a
plaintive
voice
full
i
thought
of
tears
oh
please
said
this
voice
go
out
and
look
in
your
garden
or
along
the
road
please
quickly
you
will
have
to
explain
i
said
impatiently
of
course
we
will
go
and
look
but
who
is
it
and
why
i
was
cut
off
there
definitely
and
i
could
not
get
central
attention
again
willie
voice
from
the
veranda
boomed
through
the
lower
floor
this
is
i
he
called
no
boiling
water
please
i
am
coming
in
he
went
into
the
library
and
lighted
a
lamp
he
was
smiling
when
i
entered
a
reassuring
smile
but
rather
a
sheepish
one
too
to
think
of
letting
him
get
by
like
that
he
said
the
cheapest
kind
of
a
trick
he
had
slammed
the
door
before
to
make
me
think
he
had
gone
out
and
all
the
time
he
was
inside
and
you
why
did
you
scream
i
thought
it
was
you
i
told
him
the
library
was
in
chaos
letters
were
lying
about
papers
books
the
drawer
of
the
large
in
the
center
of
the
room
had
been
drawn
out
and
searched
the
history
of
bolivar
county
for
instance
was
lying
on
the
floor
face
down
in
a
most
ignoble
position
in
one
place
books
had
been
taken
from
a
recess
by
the
fireplace
revealing
a
small
wall
cupboard
behind
i
had
never
known
of
the
but
a
glance
into
it
revealed
only
a
bottle
of
red
ink
and
the
manuscript
of
a
sermon
on
missions
standing
in
the
disorder
of
the
room
i
told
willie
about
the
he
listened
attentively
and
at
first
skeptically
probably
a
ruse
to
get
us
out
of
the
house
but
coming
a
trifle
late
to
be
useful
was
his
comment
but
i
had
read
distress
in
the
second
voice
and
said
so
at
last
he
went
to
the
telephone
i
verify
it
he
explained
if
some
one
is
really
anxious
i
get
the
car
and
take
a
scout
around
but
he
received
no
satisfaction
from
the
bullard
girl
who
he
reported
listened
stoically
and
then
said
she
was
sorry
but
she
did
not
remember
who
had
called
on
his
reminding
her
that
she
must
have
a
record
she
countered
with
the
flat
statement
that
there
had
been
no
call
for
us
that
night
willie
looked
thoughtful
when
he
returned
to
the
library
there
a
queer
story
back
of
all
this
he
said
i
think
i
get
the
car
and
scout
around
he
is
armed
willie
i
protested
he
does
want
to
shoot
me
or
he
could
have
done
it
was
his
answer
i
just
take
a
look
around
and
come
back
to
report
it
was
three
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
go
he
was
as
he
observed
rather
sketchily
clad
but
the
night
was
warm
i
saw
him
off
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
then
i
went
into
the
library
to
wait
and
to
put
things
to
rights
while
i
waited
the
dawn
is
early
in
august
and
although
it
was
not
more
than
four
when
willie
came
back
it
was
about
daylight
by
that
time
i
went
to
the
door
and
watched
him
bring
the
car
to
a
standstill
he
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
me
absolutely
nothing
he
said
it
was
a
ruse
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
of
course
i
run
the
whole
way
between
here
and
town
twice
but
that
could
not
have
taken
an
hour
i
protested
no
he
said
i
met
the
doctor
what
his
name
the
local
anyhow
footing
it
out
of
the
village
to
a
case
and
i
took
him
to
his
destination
he
has
a
car
it
seems
but
it
out
of
order
interesting
old
chap
he
added
as
i
led
the
way
into
the
house
did
know
me
from
adam
but
opened
up
when
he
found
who
i
was
i
had
prepared
the
coffee
machine
and
carried
the
tray
to
the
library
while
i
lighted
the
lamp
he
stood
whistling
softly
and
thoughtfully
at
last
he
said
look
here
aunt
agnes
i
think
i
a
good
bit
of
a
fool
but
some
time
this
morning
i
wish
you
would
call
up
thomas
jenkins
on
the
elmburg
road
and
find
out
if
any
one
is
sick
there
but
when
i
stared
at
him
he
only
laughed
sheepishly
you
can
see
how
your
suspicious
disposition
has
undermined
and
ruined
my
once
trusting
nature
he
scoffed
he
took
his
coffee
and
then
stripping
off
his
ulster
departed
for
bed
i
stopped
to
put
away
the
coffee
machine
and
with
maggie
in
mind
to
hang
up
his
it
was
then
that
the
flashlight
fell
out
i
picked
it
up
it
was
shaped
like
a
revolver
i
stopped
in
willie
room
on
my
way
to
my
own
and
held
it
out
to
him
where
did
you
get
that
i
asked
good
heavens
he
said
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
it
belongs
to
the
doctor
he
gave
it
to
me
to
examine
the
fan
belt
i
must
have
dropped
it
into
my
pocket
and
still
i
was
nowhere
suppose
i
had
touched
this
flashlight
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
mistaken
it
for
a
revolver
suppose
that
the
doctor
making
his
way
toward
the
village
and
finding
himself
pursued
had
faced
about
and
pretended
to
be
leaving
it
grant
in
a
word
that
doctor
lingard
himself
had
been
our
night
visitor
what
then
why
had
he
done
it
what
of
the
urging
me
to
search
the
road
did
some
one
realize
what
was
happening
and
take
this
method
of
warning
us
and
sending
us
after
the
fugitive
i
knew
the
thomas
jenkins
farm
on
the
elmsburg
road
i
had
indeed
bought
vegetables
and
eggs
from
jenkins
himself
that
morning
as
early
as
i
dared
i
called
the
jenkins
farm
jenkins
himself
would
bring
me
three
dozen
eggs
that
day
they
were
a
little
torn
up
out
there
as
jenkins
had
borne
a
small
daughter
at
seven
when
i
told
willie
he
was
evidently
relieved
i
glad
of
it
he
said
heartily
the
doctor
a
fine
old
chap
and
i
hate
to
think
he
was
mixed
up
in
any
shady
business
he
was
insistent
that
day
that
i
give
up
the
house
he
said
it
was
not
safe
and
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
but
although
i
did
not
tell
him
of
it
i
had
even
more
strongly
than
ever
the
impression
that
something
must
be
done
to
help
miss
emily
and
that
i
was
the
one
who
must
do
it
yet
in
the
broad
light
of
day
with
the
sunshine
pouring
into
the
rooms
i
was
compelled
to
confess
that
willie
theory
was
more
than
upheld
by
the
facts
first
of
all
was
the
character
of
miss
emily
as
i
read
it
sternly
conscientious
proud
and
yet
gentle
second
there
was
the
connection
of
the
bullard
girl
with
the
case
and
third
there
was
the
invader
of
the
night
before
an
unknown
quantity
where
so
much
seemed
known
where
a
situation
involving
miss
emily
alone
seemed
to
call
for
no
one
else
willie
put
the
matter
flatly
to
me
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
drawing
on
his
driving
gloves
do
you
want
to
follow
it
up
he
asked
is
it
better
to
let
it
go
after
all
you
have
only
rented
the
house
you
have
taken
over
its
history
or
any
responsibility
but
the
rent
i
think
miss
emily
needs
to
be
helped
i
said
rather
feebly
let
her
friends
help
her
she
has
plenty
of
them
besides
is
it
rather
a
queer
way
to
help
her
to
try
to
fasten
a
murder
on
her
i
could
not
explain
what
i
felt
so
strongly
that
miss
emily
could
only
be
helped
by
being
hurt
that
whatever
she
was
concealing
the
long
concealment
was
killing
her
that
i
felt
in
her
it
is
always
difficult
to
put
what
i
felt
about
miss
emily
into
words
that
she
both
hoped
for
and
dreaded
desperately
the
light
of
the
truth
but
if
i
was
hardly
practical
when
it
came
to
miss
emily
i
was
rational
enough
in
other
things
it
is
with
no
small
pride
but
without
exultation
for
in
the
end
it
cost
too
much
that
i
point
to
the
solution
of
one
issue
as
my
own
with
willie
gone
maggie
and
i
settled
down
to
the
quiet
tenure
of
our
days
she
informed
me
on
the
morning
after
that
eventful
night
that
she
had
not
closed
an
eye
after
one
she
came
into
the
library
and
asked
me
if
i
could
order
her
some
fiddlesticks
i
said
sharply
you
slept
all
night
i
was
up
and
around
the
house
and
you
never
knew
it
honest
to
heaven
miss
agnes
i
never
slep
at
all
i
heard
a
horse
galloping
like
it
was
runnin
off
and
it
waked
me
for
good
and
after
a
time
i
felt
that
however
mistaken
maggie
had
been
about
her
night
sleep
she
was
possibly
correct
about
the
horse
he
started
to
run
about
the
stable
somewhere
she
said
you
can
smile
if
you
want
that
the
heaven
truth
and
he
came
down
the
drive
on
the
jump
and
out
onto
the
road
we
can
go
and
look
for
i
said
and
rose
but
maggie
only
shook
her
head
it
was
no
real
horse
miss
agnes
she
said
you
find
nothing
anyhow
i
been
and
looked
there
not
a
mark
but
maggie
was
wrong
i
found
in
plenty
in
the
turf
beside
the
drive
and
a
track
of
them
through
the
in
the
garden
more
than
that
behind
the
stable
i
found
where
a
horse
had
been
tied
and
had
broken
away
a
piece
of
worn
strap
still
hung
there
it
was
sufficiently
clear
then
that
whoever
had
broken
into
the
house
had
come
on
horseback
and
left
afoot
but
many
people
in
the
neighborhood
used
horses
the
clue
if
clue
it
can
be
called
got
me
nowhere
iv
for
several
days
things
remained
in
statu
quo
our
lives
went
on
evenly
the
telephone
was
at
our
service
without
any
of
its
past
vagaries
maggie
eyes
ceased
to
look
as
if
they
were
being
pushed
out
from
behind
and
i
ceased
to
waken
at
night
and
listen
for
untoward
signs
willie
telephoned
daily
he
was
frankly
uneasy
about
my
remaining
there
you
know
something
that
somebody
resents
your
knowing
he
said
a
day
or
two
after
the
night
visitor
it
may
become
very
uncomfortable
for
you
and
after
a
day
or
two
i
began
to
feel
that
it
was
being
made
uncomfortable
for
me
i
am
a
social
being
i
like
people
in
the
city
my
neighborly
instincts
have
died
of
a
sort
of
brick
wall
apathy
but
in
the
country
it
comes
to
life
again
the
instinct
of
gregariousness
is
as
old
as
the
first
hamlets
i
daresay
when
prehistoric
man
ceased
to
live
in
trees
and
banded
together
for
protection
from
the
wild
beasts
that
walked
the
earth
the
village
became
unfriendly
it
was
almost
a
matter
of
a
night
one
day
the
postmistress
leaned
on
the
shelf
at
her
window
and
chatted
with
me
the
next
she
passed
out
my
letters
with
hardly
a
glance
graves
did
not
see
me
at
early
communion
on
sunday
morning
the
hackman
was
busy
when
i
called
him
it
was
intangible
a
matter
of
omission
not
commission
the
doctor
wife
who
had
asked
me
to
tea
called
up
and
regretted
that
she
must
go
to
the
city
that
day
i
sat
down
then
and
took
stock
of
things
did
the
village
believe
that
miss
emily
must
be
saved
from
me
did
the
village
know
the
story
i
was
trying
to
learn
and
was
it
determined
i
should
never
find
out
the
truth
and
if
this
were
so
was
the
village
right
or
was
i
they
would
save
miss
emily
by
concealment
while
i
felt
that
concealment
had
failed
and
that
only
the
truth
would
do
did
the
village
know
or
only
suspect
or
was
it
not
the
village
at
all
but
one
or
two
people
who
were
determined
to
drive
me
away
my
theories
were
rudely
disturbed
shortly
after
that
by
a
visit
from
martin
sprague
i
fancied
that
willie
had
sent
him
but
he
evaded
my
question
i
like
another
look
at
that
slip
of
paper
he
said
where
do
you
keep
it
by
the
way
in
a
safe
place
i
replied
and
he
laughed
the
truth
was
that
i
had
taken
out
the
removable
inner
sole
of
a
slipper
and
had
placed
it
underneath
an
excellent
but
one
i
did
not
care
to
confide
to
him
when
i
had
brought
it
downstairs
he
read
it
over
again
carefully
and
then
sat
back
with
it
in
his
hand
now
tell
me
about
everything
he
said
i
did
while
he
listened
attentively
afterward
we
walked
back
to
the
barn
and
i
showed
him
the
piece
of
broken
halter
still
tied
there
he
surveyed
it
without
comment
but
on
the
way
back
to
the
house
he
said
if
the
village
is
lined
up
as
you
say
it
is
i
suppose
it
is
useless
to
interview
the
he
has
probably
repaired
that
strap
or
sold
a
new
one
to
whoever
it
would
be
a
nice
clue
to
follow
up
i
am
not
doing
detective
work
i
said
shortly
i
am
trying
to
help
some
one
who
is
dying
of
anxiety
and
terror
he
nodded
i
get
you
he
said
but
his
tone
was
not
flippant
the
fact
is
of
course
that
the
early
theory
wo
hold
there
has
been
a
crime
and
the
little
old
lady
did
not
commit
it
but
suppose
you
find
out
who
did
it
how
is
that
going
to
help
her
i
do
know
martin
i
said
in
a
sort
of
desperation
but
i
have
the
most
curious
feeling
that
she
is
depending
on
me
the
way
she
spoke
the
day
i
saw
her
and
her
eyes
and
everything
i
know
you
think
it
nonsense
i
finished
lamely
i
think
you
better
give
up
the
place
and
go
back
to
town
he
said
but
i
saw
that
he
watched
me
carefully
and
when
at
last
he
got
up
to
go
he
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
think
you
are
right
after
all
he
said
there
are
a
good
many
things
that
ca
be
reasoned
out
with
any
logic
we
have
but
that
are
true
nevertheless
we
call
it
intuition
but
it
really
subconscious
intelligence
stay
by
all
means
if
you
feel
you
should
in
the
doorway
he
said
remember
this
miss
agnes
both
a
crime
of
violence
and
a
confession
like
the
one
in
your
hand
are
the
products
of
impulse
they
are
not
either
of
them
premeditated
they
are
not
the
work
then
of
a
calculating
or
cautious
nature
look
for
a
big
emotional
type
it
was
a
day
or
two
after
that
that
i
made
my
visit
to
miss
emily
i
had
stopped
once
before
to
be
told
with
an
air
of
finality
that
the
invalid
was
asleep
on
this
occasion
i
took
with
me
a
basket
of
fruit
i
had
half
expected
a
refusal
but
i
was
admitted
the
bullard
girl
was
with
miss
emily
she
had
i
think
been
kneeling
beside
the
bed
and
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
but
miss
emily
herself
was
as
cool
as
dainty
and
starched
and
fragile
as
ever
more
so
i
thought
she
was
thinner
and
although
it
was
a
warm
august
day
a
white
silk
shawl
was
wrapped
around
her
shoulders
and
fastened
with
an
amethyst
brooch
in
my
clasp
her
thin
hand
felt
hot
and
dry
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
she
said
simply
she
looked
at
anne
bullard
and
the
message
in
her
eyes
was
plain
enough
but
the
girl
ignored
it
she
stood
across
the
bed
from
me
and
eyed
me
steadily
my
dear
said
miss
emily
in
her
voice
if
you
have
anything
to
do
miss
blakiston
will
sit
with
me
for
a
little
while
i
have
nothing
to
do
said
the
girl
doggedly
perhaps
this
is
not
the
word
she
had
more
the
look
of
endurance
and
supreme
patience
there
was
no
sharpness
about
her
although
there
was
vigilance
miss
emily
sighed
and
i
saw
her
eyes
seek
the
bible
beside
her
but
she
only
said
gently
then
sit
down
dear
you
can
work
at
my
knitting
if
you
like
my
hands
get
very
tired
she
asked
me
questions
about
the
house
and
the
garden
the
raspberries
were
usually
quite
good
and
she
was
rather
celebrated
for
her
lettuces
if
i
had
more
than
i
needed
would
i
mind
if
staley
took
a
few
in
to
the
doctor
who
was
fond
of
them
the
mention
of
doctor
lingard
took
me
back
to
the
night
of
the
burglary
i
wondered
if
to
tell
miss
emily
would
unduly
agitate
her
i
think
i
would
not
have
told
her
but
i
caught
the
girl
eye
across
the
bed
raised
from
her
knitting
and
fixed
on
me
with
a
peculiar
intensity
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
miss
emily
was
surrounded
by
a
conspiracy
of
silence
and
it
roused
my
antagonism
there
are
plenty
of
lettuces
i
said
although
a
few
were
trampled
by
a
runaway
horse
the
other
night
it
is
rather
a
curious
story
so
i
told
her
of
our
night
visitor
i
told
it
humorously
lightly
touching
on
my
own
horror
at
finding
i
had
been
standing
with
my
hand
on
the
burglar
shoulder
but
i
was
sorry
for
my
impulse
immediately
for
i
saw
miss
emily
body
grow
rigid
and
her
hands
twist
together
she
did
not
look
at
me
she
stared
fixedly
at
the
girl
their
eyes
met
it
was
as
if
miss
emily
asked
a
question
which
the
girl
refused
to
answer
it
was
as
certain
as
though
it
had
been
a
matter
of
words
instead
of
glances
it
was
over
in
a
moment
miss
bullard
went
back
to
her
knitting
but
miss
emily
lay
still
i
think
i
should
not
have
told
you
i
apologized
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
of
course
nothing
whatever
was
taken
and
no
damage
done
except
to
the
lettuces
anne
said
miss
emily
will
you
bring
me
some
fresh
water
the
girl
rose
reluctantly
but
she
did
not
go
farther
than
the
top
of
the
staircase
just
beyond
the
door
we
heard
her
calling
to
some
one
below
in
her
clear
young
voice
to
bring
the
water
and
the
next
moment
she
was
back
in
the
room
but
miss
emily
had
had
the
opportunity
for
one
sentence
i
know
now
she
said
quietly
that
you
have
found
it
anne
bullard
was
watching
from
the
doorway
and
it
seemed
to
me
having
got
so
far
i
could
not
retreat
i
must
go
on
miss
bullard
i
said
i
would
like
to
have
just
a
short
conversation
with
miss
emily
it
is
about
a
private
matter
i
am
sure
you
will
not
mind
if
i
ask
you
i
shall
not
go
out
anne
said
miss
emily
sharply
the
girl
was
dogged
enough
by
that
time
both
dogged
and
frightened
i
felt
but
she
stood
her
ground
she
is
not
to
be
worried
about
anything
she
insisted
and
she
not
supposed
to
have
visitors
that
the
doctor
orders
i
felt
outraged
and
indignant
but
against
the
stone
wall
of
the
presence
and
her
distrust
i
was
helpless
i
got
up
with
as
much
dignity
as
i
could
muster
i
should
have
been
told
that
downstairs
the
woman
a
fool
said
anne
bullard
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
fierceness
she
stood
aside
as
having
said
to
miss
emily
i
went
out
and
i
felt
that
she
hardly
breathed
until
i
had
got
safely
to
the
street
looking
back
i
feel
that
emily
benton
died
at
the
hands
of
her
friends
for
she
died
indeed
died
in
the
act
of
trying
to
tell
me
what
they
had
determined
she
should
never
tell
died
of
kindness
and
misunderstanding
died
repressed
as
she
had
lived
repressed
yet
i
think
died
calmly
and
bravely
i
had
made
no
further
attempt
to
see
her
and
maggie
and
i
had
taken
up
again
the
quiet
course
of
our
lives
the
telephone
did
not
ring
of
nights
the
cat
came
and
went
spending
as
i
had
learned
its
days
with
miss
emily
and
its
nights
with
us
i
have
wondered
since
how
many
nights
miss
emily
had
spent
in
the
low
chair
in
that
back
hall
where
the
confession
lay
hidden
that
the
cat
should
feel
it
could
sleep
nowhere
else
the
days
went
by
warm
days
and
cooler
ones
but
rarely
rainy
ones
the
dust
from
the
road
settled
thick
over
flowers
and
shrubbery
the
lettuces
wilted
and
those
that
stood
up
in
the
sun
were
strong
and
bitter
by
the
end
of
august
we
were
gasping
in
a
hot
dryness
that
cracked
the
skin
and
made
any
but
cold
food
impossible
miss
emily
lay
through
it
all
in
her
hot
upper
room
in
the
village
and
my
attempt
through
doctor
lingard
to
coax
her
back
to
the
house
by
offering
to
leave
it
brought
only
a
negative
it
would
be
better
for
her
you
understand
the
doctor
said
over
the
telephone
but
she
is
very
determined
and
she
insists
on
remaining
where
she
is
and
i
believe
this
was
the
truth
they
would
surely
have
been
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
these
friends
of
miss
emily
i
have
wondered
since
what
they
thought
of
me
anne
bullard
and
the
doctor
to
have
feared
me
as
they
did
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
i
see
a
woman
with
a
determined
nose
slightly
inquisitive
and
what
i
trust
is
a
humorous
mouth
for
it
has
no
other
virtues
but
they
feared
me
perhaps
long
looking
for
a
danger
affects
the
mental
vision
anyhow
by
the
doctor
order
i
was
not
allowed
to
call
and
see
miss
emily
again
then
one
night
the
heat
suddenly
lifted
one
moment
i
was
sitting
on
the
veranda
lifeless
and
inert
and
the
next
a
cool
wind
with
a
hint
of
rain
had
set
the
shutters
to
banging
and
the
curtains
to
flowing
like
flags
of
truce
from
the
windows
the
air
was
life
energy
i
felt
revivified
and
something
of
the
same
sort
must
have
happened
to
miss
emily
she
must
have
sat
up
among
her
pillows
her
face
fanned
with
the
electric
breeze
and
made
her
determination
to
see
me
anne
bullard
was
at
work
and
she
was
free
from
observation
it
must
have
been
nine
when
she
left
the
house
a
shaken
little
figure
in
black
not
as
neat
as
usual
but
hooked
and
buttoned
for
all
that
with
no
one
will
ever
know
what
agony
of
old
hands
she
was
two
hours
and
a
half
getting
to
the
house
and
the
rain
came
at
ten
by
half
after
eleven
when
the
doorbell
rang
she
was
a
sodden
mass
of
wet
garments
and
her
teeth
were
chattering
when
i
led
her
into
the
library
she
could
not
talk
the
thing
she
had
come
to
say
was
totally
beyond
her
i
put
her
to
bed
in
her
own
room
and
two
days
later
she
died
i
had
made
no
protest
when
anne
bullard
presented
herself
at
the
door
the
morning
after
miss
emily
arrived
and
walking
into
the
house
took
sleepless
charge
of
the
sickroom
and
i
made
no
reference
save
once
to
the
reason
for
the
tragedy
that
was
the
night
miss
emily
died
anne
bullard
had
called
to
me
that
she
feared
there
was
a
change
and
i
went
into
the
sickroom
there
was
a
change
and
i
could
only
shake
my
head
she
burst
out
at
me
then
if
only
you
had
never
taken
this
house
she
said
you
people
with
money
you
think
there
is
nothing
you
can
not
have
you
came
and
now
look
anne
i
said
with
a
bitterness
i
could
not
conceal
miss
emily
is
not
young
and
i
think
she
is
ready
to
go
but
she
has
been
killed
by
her
friends
i
wanted
to
help
but
they
would
not
allow
me
to
toward
morning
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
and
we
sat
together
listening
to
the
stertorous
breathing
from
the
bed
maggie
who
had
been
up
all
night
had
given
me
notice
at
three
in
the
morning
and
was
upstairs
packing
her
trunk
i
went
into
my
room
and
brought
back
miss
emily
confession
is
it
time
i
said
to
tell
me
about
this
i
ought
to
know
i
think
before
she
goes
if
it
is
not
true
you
owe
it
to
her
i
think
but
she
shook
her
head
i
looked
at
the
confession
and
from
it
to
miss
emily
pinched
old
face
to
whom
it
may
concern
on
the
day
of
may
i
killed
a
woman
here
in
this
house
i
hope
you
will
not
find
this
until
i
am
dead
signed
emily
benton
anne
was
watching
me
i
went
to
the
mantel
and
got
a
match
and
then
standing
near
the
bed
i
lighted
it
and
touched
it
to
the
paper
it
burned
slowly
a
thin
blue
semicircle
of
fire
that
ate
its
way
slowly
across
until
there
was
but
the
corner
i
held
i
dropped
it
into
the
fireplace
and
watched
it
turn
to
black
ash
i
may
have
fancied
it
i
am
always
fancying
things
about
miss
emily
but
i
will
always
think
that
she
knew
she
drew
a
longer
quieter
breath
and
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
closed
i
think
she
died
in
the
first
sleep
she
had
had
in
hours
i
had
expected
anne
bullard
to
show
emotion
for
no
one
could
doubt
her
attachment
to
miss
emily
but
she
only
stood
stoically
by
the
bed
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
swiftly
went
to
the
wall
opposite
and
took
down
from
the
wall
the
photograph
graves
had
commented
on
anne
bullard
stood
with
the
picture
in
her
hand
looking
at
it
and
suddenly
she
broke
into
sobs
it
was
stormy
weeping
and
i
got
the
impression
that
she
wept
not
for
miss
emily
but
for
many
other
things
as
though
the
grief
of
years
had
broken
out
at
last
she
took
the
photograph
away
and
i
never
saw
it
again
miss
emily
was
buried
from
her
home
i
obliterated
myself
and
her
friends
who
were
i
felt
her
murderers
came
in
and
took
charge
they
paid
me
the
tribute
of
much
politeness
but
no
cordiality
and
i
think
they
felt
toward
me
as
i
felt
toward
them
they
blamed
me
with
the
whole
affair
she
left
her
property
all
to
anne
bullard
to
the
astonished
rage
of
the
congregation
which
had
expected
the
return
of
its
dimes
and
quarters
no
doubt
in
the
shape
of
a
new
altar
or
perhaps
an
organ
not
a
cent
to
keep
up
the
mausoleum
or
anything
graves
confided
to
me
and
nothing
to
the
church
all
to
that
who
comes
from
no
one
knows
where
it
enough
to
make
her
father
turn
over
in
his
grave
it
has
set
people
talking
i
can
tell
you
maggie
mental
state
during
the
days
preceding
the
funeral
was
curious
she
coupled
the
most
meticulous
care
as
to
the
preparations
for
the
ceremony
and
a
sort
of
loving
gentleness
when
she
decked
miss
small
old
frame
for
its
last
rites
with
suspicion
and
hatred
of
miss
emily
living
and
this
suspicion
she
held
also
against
anne
bullard
yet
she
did
not
want
to
leave
the
house
i
do
not
know
just
what
she
expected
to
find
we
were
cleaning
up
preparatory
to
going
back
to
the
city
and
i
felt
that
at
least
a
part
of
maggie
enthusiasm
for
corners
was
due
to
a
hope
of
locating
more
concealed
papers
she
was
rather
less
than
polite
to
the
bullard
girl
who
was
staying
on
at
my
invitation
because
the
village
was
now
flagrantly
unfriendly
and
suspicious
of
her
and
for
some
strange
reason
the
fact
that
miss
emily
cat
followed
anne
everywhere
convinced
maggie
that
her
suspicions
were
justified
it
like
this
miss
agnes
she
said
one
morning
leaning
on
the
handle
of
a
floor
brush
she
had
some
power
over
the
old
lady
and
that
how
she
got
the
property
and
i
am
saying
nothing
but
no
christian
that
girl
to
see
her
and
that
cat
going
out
night
after
night
both
snooping
along
on
their
tiptoes
it
ai
normal
i
had
several
visits
from
martin
sprague
since
miss
emily
death
and
after
a
time
i
realized
that
he
was
interested
in
anne
she
was
quite
attractive
in
her
mourning
clothes
and
there
was
something
about
her
not
in
feature
but
in
neatness
and
in
the
way
her
things
had
of
well
staying
in
place
that
reminded
me
of
miss
emily
herself
it
was
rather
surprising
too
to
see
the
way
she
fitted
into
her
new
surroundings
and
circumstances
but
i
did
not
approve
of
martin
attraction
to
her
she
had
volunteered
no
information
about
herself
she
apparently
had
no
people
she
was
a
lady
i
felt
although
with
the
exception
of
her
new
mourning
her
clothing
was
shabby
and
her
linen
even
coarse
she
held
the
key
to
the
confession
i
knew
that
and
i
had
no
more
hope
of
getting
it
from
her
than
i
had
from
the
cat
so
i
prepared
to
go
back
to
the
city
with
the
mystery
unsolved
it
seemed
a
pity
when
i
had
got
so
far
with
it
i
had
reconstructed
a
situation
out
of
such
bricks
as
i
had
the
books
in
the
cellar
graves
story
of
the
river
the
confession
possibly
the
and
the
handkerchief
i
had
even
some
material
left
over
in
the
form
of
the
night
intruder
who
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
doctor
and
then
having
got
so
far
i
had
had
to
stop
for
lack
of
other
bricks
a
day
or
two
before
i
went
back
to
the
city
maggie
came
to
me
with
a
folded
handkerchief
in
her
hand
is
that
yours
she
asked
i
disclaimed
it
it
was
not
very
fine
and
looked
rather
yellow
a
name
on
it
maggie
volunteered
wright
i
think
it
is
hers
unless
she
picked
it
up
somewhere
it
just
come
out
of
the
maggie
eyes
were
snapping
with
suspicion
there
ai
any
wrights
around
here
miss
agnes
she
said
i
sh
say
she
here
under
a
false
name
wright
likely
hers
in
tracing
the
mystery
of
the
confession
i
find
that
three
apparently
disconnected
discoveries
paved
the
way
to
its
solution
of
these
the
handkerchief
came
first
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
in
some
manner
the
handkerchief
i
had
found
in
the
book
in
the
cellar
had
got
into
the
wash
but
it
was
where
i
had
placed
it
for
safety
in
the
in
the
library
i
brought
it
out
and
compared
the
two
they
were
unlike
save
in
the
one
regard
the
name
wright
was
clear
enough
on
the
one
maggie
had
found
with
it
as
a
guide
the
other
name
was
easily
seen
to
be
the
same
moreover
both
had
been
marked
by
the
same
hand
yet
on
anne
bullard
being
shown
the
one
maggie
had
found
she
disclaimed
it
do
you
think
some
one
dropped
it
at
the
funeral
she
asked
but
i
thought
as
i
turned
away
that
she
took
a
step
toward
me
when
i
stopped
however
and
faced
about
she
was
intent
on
something
outside
the
window
and
so
it
went
i
got
nowhere
and
now
by
way
of
complication
i
felt
my
sympathy
for
anne
loneliness
turning
to
genuine
interest
she
was
so
stoical
so
repressed
and
so
lonely
and
she
was
tremendously
proud
her
pride
was
vaguely
reminiscent
of
miss
emily
she
bore
her
ostracism
almost
fiercely
yet
there
were
times
when
i
felt
her
eyes
on
me
singularly
gentle
and
appealing
yet
she
volunteered
nothing
about
herself
i
intended
to
finish
the
history
of
bolivar
county
before
i
left
i
dislike
not
finishing
a
book
besides
this
one
fascinated
me
the
smug
complacence
and
almost
loud
virtue
of
the
author
his
satisfaction
in
bolivar
county
and
his
small
hits
at
the
world
outside
his
patronage
to
those
not
of
it
and
always
when
i
began
to
read
i
turned
to
the
inscription
in
miss
emily
hand
the
hand
of
the
confession
and
i
wondered
if
she
had
really
believed
it
all
so
on
this
day
i
found
the
name
bullard
in
the
book
it
had
belonged
to
the
reverend
samuel
thaddeus
grandmother
and
he
distinctly
stated
that
she
was
the
last
of
her
line
he
inferred
indeed
that
since
the
line
was
to
end
it
had
chosen
a
fitting
finish
in
his
immediate
progenitor
that
night
at
dinner
i
said
anne
are
there
any
bullards
in
this
neighborhood
now
i
have
never
heard
of
any
but
i
have
not
been
here
long
it
is
not
a
common
name
i
persisted
but
she
received
my
statement
in
silence
she
had
as
i
have
said
rather
a
gift
for
silence
that
afternoon
i
was
wandering
about
the
garden
snipping
faded
roses
with
miss
emily
garden
shears
when
i
saw
maggie
coming
swiftly
toward
me
when
she
caught
my
eye
she
beckoned
to
me
walk
quiet
miss
agnes
she
said
and
do
say
i
did
warn
you
she
in
the
library
so
feeling
hatefully
like
a
spy
i
went
quietly
over
the
lawn
toward
the
library
windows
they
were
long
ones
to
the
floor
and
at
first
i
made
out
nothing
then
i
saw
anne
she
was
on
her
knees
following
the
border
of
the
carpet
with
fingers
that
examined
it
inch
by
inch
she
turned
as
if
she
felt
our
eyes
on
her
and
saw
us
i
shall
never
forget
her
face
she
looked
stricken
i
turned
away
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
that
made
me
think
of
miss
emily
lying
among
her
pillows
and
waiting
for
me
to
say
the
thing
she
was
dreading
to
hear
i
sent
maggie
away
with
a
gesture
there
was
something
in
her
pursed
lips
that
threatened
danger
for
i
felt
then
as
if
i
had
always
known
it
and
only
just
realized
i
knew
it
that
somewhere
in
that
room
lay
the
answer
to
all
questions
lay
miss
emily
secret
and
i
did
not
wish
to
learn
it
it
was
better
to
go
on
wondering
to
question
and
doubt
and
decide
and
decide
again
i
was
i
think
in
a
state
of
nervous
terror
by
that
time
terror
and
apprehension
while
miss
emily
lived
i
had
hoped
to
help
but
now
it
seemed
too
hatefully
like
accusing
when
she
could
not
defend
herself
and
there
is
another
element
that
i
am
bound
to
acknowledge
there
was
an
element
of
jealousy
of
anne
bullard
both
of
us
had
tried
to
help
miss
emily
she
had
foiled
my
attempt
in
her
own
endeavor
a
mistaken
endeavor
i
felt
but
there
was
now
to
be
no
blemish
on
my
efforts
i
would
no
longer
pry
or
question
or
watch
it
was
too
late
in
a
curious
fashion
each
of
us
wished
i
think
to
prove
the
quality
of
her
tenderness
for
the
little
old
lady
who
was
gone
beyond
all
human
tenderness
so
that
evening
after
dinner
i
faced
anne
in
the
library
why
not
let
things
be
as
they
are
anne
i
asked
it
can
do
no
good
whatever
it
is
and
i
do
not
know
why
not
let
things
rest
some
one
may
find
it
she
replied
some
one
who
does
not
care
as
i
as
we
care
are
you
sure
there
is
something
she
told
me
near
the
last
i
only
do
know
just
where
it
is
and
if
you
find
it
it
is
a
letter
i
shall
burn
it
without
reading
although
she
drew
a
long
breath
i
know
what
it
contains
if
in
any
way
it
comes
into
my
hands
i
assured
her
i
shall
let
you
know
and
i
shall
not
read
it
she
looked
thoughtful
rather
than
grateful
i
hardly
know
she
said
i
think
she
would
want
you
to
read
it
if
it
came
to
you
it
explains
so
much
and
it
was
a
part
of
her
plan
you
know
of
course
that
she
had
a
plan
it
was
a
sort
of
arrangement
she
hesitated
it
was
a
sort
of
pact
she
made
with
god
if
you
know
what
i
mean
that
night
maggie
found
the
letter
i
had
gone
upstairs
and
anne
was
i
think
already
asleep
i
heard
what
sounded
like
distant
hammering
and
i
went
to
the
door
some
one
was
in
the
library
below
the
light
was
shining
out
into
the
hall
and
my
discovery
of
that
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
faint
splintering
of
wood
rather
outraged
than
alarmed
i
went
back
for
my
and
as
i
left
the
room
i
confronted
maggie
in
the
hallway
she
had
an
envelope
in
one
hand
and
a
hatchet
in
the
other
i
found
it
she
said
briefly
she
held
it
out
and
i
took
it
on
the
outside
in
miss
emily
writing
it
said
to
whom
it
may
concern
it
was
sealed
i
turned
it
over
in
my
hand
while
maggie
talked
when
i
saw
that
girl
crawling
around
she
said
seems
to
me
i
remembered
all
at
once
seeing
miss
emily
that
day
i
found
her
running
her
finger
along
the
baseboard
says
i
to
myself
there
something
more
hidden
and
she
do
know
where
it
is
but
i
do
so
i
lifted
the
baseboard
and
this
was
behind
it
anne
heard
her
from
her
room
and
she
went
out
soon
afterward
i
heard
her
going
down
the
stairs
and
called
to
her
but
she
did
not
answer
i
closed
the
door
on
maggie
and
stood
in
my
room
staring
at
the
envelope
i
have
wondered
since
whether
miss
emily
had
she
lived
would
have
put
the
responsibility
on
providence
for
the
discovery
of
her
pitiful
story
so
many
of
us
blame
the
remorseless
hand
of
destiny
for
what
is
so
manifestly
our
own
doing
it
was
her
own
anxiety
surely
that
led
to
the
discovery
in
each
instance
yet
i
am
certain
that
old
emily
benton
died
convinced
that
a
higher
hand
than
any
on
earth
had
directed
the
discovery
of
the
confession
miss
emily
has
been
dead
for
more
than
a
year
now
to
publish
the
letter
can
do
her
no
harm
in
a
way
too
i
feel
it
may
be
the
fulfilment
of
that
strange
pact
she
made
for
just
as
discovery
was
the
thing
she
most
dreaded
so
she
felt
that
by
paying
her
penalty
here
she
would
be
saved
something
beyond
that
sort
of
spiritual
which
most
of
us
call
religion
anne
sprague
she
is
married
now
to
martin
has
i
think
some
of
miss
emily
feeling
about
it
although
she
denies
it
but
i
am
sure
that
in
consenting
to
the
recording
of
miss
emily
story
she
feels
that
she
is
doing
what
that
gentle
fatalist
would
call
following
the
hand
of
providence
i
read
the
letter
that
night
in
the
library
where
the
light
was
good
it
was
a
narrative
not
a
letter
strictly
speaking
it
began
abruptly
i
must
set
down
this
thing
as
it
happened
i
shall
write
it
fully
because
i
must
get
it
off
my
mind
i
find
that
i
am
always
composing
it
and
that
my
lips
move
when
i
walk
along
the
street
or
even
when
i
am
sitting
in
church
how
terrible
if
i
should
some
day
speak
it
aloud
my
was
a
catholic
she
was
a
bullard
perhaps
it
is
from
her
that
i
have
this
overwhelming
impulse
to
confession
and
lately
i
have
been
terrified
i
must
tell
it
or
i
shall
shriek
it
out
some
day
in
the
church
during
the
litany
battle
and
murder
and
from
sudden
death
good
lord
deliver
us
there
was
a
space
here
when
the
writing
began
again
time
had
elapsed
the
ink
was
different
the
writing
more
controlled
what
a
terrible
thing
hate
is
it
is
a
poison
it
penetrates
the
mind
and
the
body
and
changes
everything
i
who
once
thought
i
could
hate
no
one
now
find
that
hate
is
my
daily
life
my
getting
up
and
lying
down
my
sleep
my
waking
hatred
envy
and
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
good
lord
deliver
us
must
one
suffer
twice
for
the
same
thing
is
it
not
true
that
we
pay
but
one
penalty
surely
we
pay
either
here
or
beyond
but
not
both
oh
not
both
will
this
ever
be
found
where
shall
i
hide
it
for
i
have
the
feeling
that
i
must
hide
it
not
destroy
it
as
the
catholic
buries
his
sin
with
the
priest
my
father
once
said
that
it
is
the
healthful
humiliation
of
the
confessional
that
is
its
reason
for
existing
if
humiliation
be
a
virtue
i
have
copied
the
confession
to
this
point
but
i
find
i
can
not
go
on
she
was
so
merciless
to
herself
so
hideously
calm
so
exact
as
to
dates
and
hours
she
had
laid
her
life
on
the
table
and
dissected
it
for
the
almighty
i
heard
the
story
that
night
gently
told
and
somehow
i
feel
that
that
is
the
version
by
which
miss
emily
will
be
judged
if
humiliation
be
a
virtue
i
read
and
was
about
to
turn
the
page
when
i
heard
anne
in
the
hall
she
was
not
alone
i
recognized
doctor
lingard
voice
five
minutes
later
i
was
sitting
opposite
him
almost
knee
to
knee
and
he
was
telling
me
how
miss
emily
had
come
to
commit
her
crime
anne
bullard
was
there
standing
on
the
hearth
rug
she
kept
her
eyes
on
me
and
after
a
time
i
realized
that
these
two
simple
people
feared
me
feared
for
miss
emily
gentle
memory
feared
that
i
good
heaven
would
make
the
thing
public
first
of
all
miss
blakiston
said
the
doctor
one
must
have
known
the
family
to
realize
the
situation
its
pride
in
its
own
uprightness
the
virtue
of
the
name
what
it
stood
for
in
bolivar
county
she
was
raised
on
that
a
benton
could
do
no
wrong
because
a
benton
would
do
no
wrong
but
there
is
another
side
also
i
doubt
if
any
girl
was
ever
raised
as
miss
emily
was
she
well
she
knew
nothing
at
fifty
she
was
as
childlike
and
innocent
as
she
was
at
ten
she
had
practically
never
heard
of
vice
the
ugly
things
for
her
did
not
exist
and
all
the
time
there
was
a
deep
and
strong
nature
underneath
she
should
have
married
and
had
children
but
there
was
no
one
here
for
her
to
marry
i
he
smiled
faintly
i
asked
for
her
myself
and
was
forbidden
the
house
for
years
as
a
result
you
have
heard
of
the
brother
but
of
course
you
have
i
know
you
have
found
the
books
such
an
existence
as
the
family
life
here
was
bound
to
have
its
reactions
carlo
was
a
reaction
years
ago
he
ran
away
with
a
girl
from
the
village
he
did
not
marry
her
i
believe
he
was
willing
at
one
time
but
his
father
opposed
it
violently
it
would
have
been
to
recognize
a
thing
he
refused
to
recognize
he
turned
suddenly
to
anne
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
be
painful
he
asked
why
i
know
it
all
very
well
this
girl
the
one
carlo
ran
away
with
determined
to
make
the
family
pay
for
that
refusal
she
made
them
actually
pay
year
by
year
emily
knew
about
it
she
had
to
pinch
to
make
the
payments
the
father
sat
in
a
sort
of
detached
position
in
the
center
of
bolivar
county
and
let
her
bear
the
brunt
of
it
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
she
learned
there
was
a
child
it
well
it
sickened
her
she
had
not
known
about
those
things
and
i
imagine
if
we
could
know
that
that
was
the
beginning
of
things
and
all
the
time
there
was
the
necessity
for
secrecy
she
had
never
known
deceit
and
now
she
was
obliged
to
practice
it
constantly
she
had
no
one
to
talk
to
her
father
beyond
making
entries
of
the
amounts
paid
to
the
woman
in
the
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
bore
it
all
year
after
year
and
it
ate
like
a
cancer
remember
i
never
knew
i
who
would
have
done
anything
for
her
she
never
told
me
carlo
lived
hard
and
came
back
to
die
the
father
went
she
nursed
them
both
i
came
every
day
and
i
never
suspected
only
now
and
then
i
wondered
about
her
she
looked
burned
i
do
know
any
other
word
then
the
night
after
carlo
had
been
buried
she
telephoned
for
me
it
was
eleven
she
met
me
out
there
in
the
hall
and
she
said
i
have
killed
somebody
i
thought
she
was
out
of
her
mind
but
she
opened
the
door
and
he
turned
and
glanced
at
anne
please
she
said
it
was
anne
mother
you
have
guessed
it
about
anne
by
now
of
course
it
seems
that
the
funeral
had
taken
the
money
for
the
payment
that
was
due
and
there
had
been
a
threat
of
exposure
and
emily
had
reached
the
i
believe
what
she
said
that
she
had
no
intention
even
of
striking
her
you
ca
take
the
act
itself
you
have
to
take
years
into
account
anyhow
she
picked
up
a
chair
and
knocked
the
woman
down
and
it
killed
her
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
heavy
hair
it
should
not
have
killed
her
he
reflected
there
must
have
been
some
other
weakness
heart
or
something
i
do
know
but
it
was
a
heavy
chair
i
do
see
how
emily
his
voice
trailed
off
there
we
were
he
said
with
a
long
breath
poor
emily
and
the
other
poor
soul
neither
of
them
fundamentally
at
fault
both
victims
i
know
about
the
books
i
put
in
hastily
i
could
not
have
him
going
over
that
again
you
knew
that
too
he
gazed
at
me
poor
emily
he
said
she
tried
to
atone
she
brought
anne
here
and
told
her
the
whole
story
it
was
a
bad
time
all
round
but
at
last
anne
saw
the
light
the
only
one
who
would
not
see
the
light
was
emily
and
at
last
she
hit
on
this
confession
idea
i
suspected
it
when
she
rented
the
house
when
i
accused
her
of
it
she
said
have
given
it
to
providence
to
decide
if
the
confession
is
found
i
shall
know
i
am
to
suffer
and
i
shall
not
lift
a
hand
to
save
myself
so
it
went
through
the
hours
her
fear
which
i
still
think
was
the
terror
that
communicated
itself
to
me
the
various
clues
which
she
poor
victim
had
overlooked
the
articles
laid
carelessly
in
the
book
she
had
been
reading
and
accidentally
hidden
with
her
forbidden
literature
the
books
themselves
with
all
of
five
years
to
destroy
them
and
left
untouched
her
own
anxiety
about
the
confession
in
the
which
led
to
our
finding
it
her
espionage
of
the
house
by
means
of
the
telephone
the
doctor
night
visit
in
search
of
the
confession
the
daily
penance
for
five
years
of
the
dead
photograph
in
her
room
all
of
these
and
her
occasional
weakenings
poor
soul
when
she
tried
to
change
her
handwriting
against
discovery
and
refused
to
allow
the
second
telephone
to
be
installed
how
clear
it
was
how
in
a
way
inevitable
and
too
how
really
best
for
her
it
had
turned
out
for
she
had
made
a
pact
and
she
died
believing
that
discovery
here
had
come
and
would
take
the
place
of
punishment
beyond
martin
sprague
came
the
next
day
i
was
in
the
library
alone
and
he
was
with
anne
in
the
garden
when
maggie
came
into
the
room
with
a
saucer
of
jelly
i
wish
you
look
at
this
she
said
if
it
cooked
too
much
it
gets
tough
and
she
straightened
suddenly
and
stood
staring
out
through
a
window
i
thank
you
to
look
out
and
see
the
in
our
garden
she
said
sharply
in
broad
daylight
too
i
but
i
did
not
hear
what
else
maggie
had
to
say
i
glanced
out
and
martin
had
raised
the
girl
face
to
his
and
was
kissing
her
gently
and
very
tenderly
and
then
and
again
as
with
fear
it
is
hard
to
put
into
words
i
felt
come
over
me
such
a
wave
of
contentment
and
happiness
as
made
me
close
my
eyes
with
the
sheer
relief
and
joy
of
it
all
was
well
the
past
was
past
and
out
of
its
mistakes
had
come
a
beautiful
thing
and
like
the
fear
this
joy
was
not
mine
it
came
to
me
i
picked
it
up
a
thought
without
words
sometimes
i
think
about
it
and
i
wonder
did
little
miss
emily
know
