introductory
note
marcus
tullius
cicero
the
greatest
of
roman
orators
and
the
chief
master
of
latin
prose
style
was
born
at
arpinum
his
father
who
was
a
man
of
property
and
belonged
to
the
class
of
the
knights
moved
to
rome
when
cicero
was
a
child
and
the
future
statesman
received
an
elaborate
education
in
rhetoric
law
and
philosophy
studying
and
practising
under
some
of
the
most
noted
teachers
of
the
time
he
began
his
career
as
an
advocate
at
the
age
of
and
almost
immediately
came
to
be
recognized
not
only
as
a
man
of
brilliant
talents
but
also
as
a
courageous
upholder
of
justice
in
the
face
of
grave
political
danger
after
two
years
of
practice
he
left
rome
to
travel
in
greece
and
asia
taking
all
the
opportunities
that
offered
to
study
his
art
under
distinguished
masters
he
returned
to
rome
greatly
improved
in
health
and
in
professional
skill
and
in
was
elected
to
the
office
of
quaestor
he
was
assigned
to
the
province
of
lilybarum
in
sicily
and
the
vigor
and
justice
of
his
administration
earned
him
the
gratitude
of
the
inhabitants
it
was
at
their
request
that
he
undertook
in
the
prosecution
of
verres
who
as
praetor
had
subjected
the
sicilians
to
incredible
extortion
and
oppression
and
his
successful
conduct
of
this
case
which
ended
in
the
conviction
and
banishment
of
verres
may
be
said
to
have
launched
him
on
his
political
career
he
became
aedile
in
the
same
year
in
praetor
and
in
was
elected
consul
by
a
large
majority
the
most
important
event
of
the
year
of
his
consulship
was
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
this
notorious
criminal
of
patrician
rank
had
conspired
with
a
number
of
others
many
of
them
young
men
of
high
birth
but
dissipated
character
to
seize
the
chief
offices
of
the
state
and
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
pecuniary
and
other
difficulties
that
had
resulted
from
their
excesses
by
the
wholesale
plunder
of
the
city
the
plot
was
unmasked
by
the
vigilance
of
cicero
five
of
the
traitors
were
summarily
executed
and
in
the
overthrow
of
the
army
that
had
been
gathered
in
their
support
catiline
himself
perished
cicero
regarded
himself
as
the
savior
of
his
country
and
his
country
for
the
moment
seemed
to
give
grateful
assent
but
reverses
were
at
hand
during
the
existence
of
the
political
combination
of
pompey
caesar
and
crassus
known
as
the
first
triumvirate
clodius
an
enemy
of
cicero
proposed
a
law
banishing
any
one
who
had
put
roman
citizens
to
death
without
trial
this
was
aimed
at
cicero
on
account
of
his
share
in
the
catiline
affair
and
in
march
he
left
rome
the
same
day
a
law
was
passed
by
which
he
was
banished
by
name
and
his
property
was
plundered
and
destroyed
a
temple
to
liberty
being
erected
on
the
site
of
his
house
in
the
city
during
his
exile
cicero
manliness
to
some
extent
deserted
him
he
drifted
from
place
to
place
seeking
the
protection
of
officials
against
assassination
writing
letters
urging
his
supporters
to
agitate
for
his
recall
sometimes
accusing
them
of
lukewarmness
and
even
treachery
bemoaning
the
ingratitude
of
his
country
or
regretting
the
course
of
action
that
had
led
to
his
outlawry
and
suffering
from
extreme
depression
over
his
separation
from
his
wife
and
children
and
the
wreck
of
his
political
ambitions
finally
in
august
the
decree
for
his
restoration
was
passed
and
he
returned
to
rome
the
next
month
being
received
with
immense
popular
enthusiasm
during
the
next
few
years
the
renewal
of
the
understanding
among
the
triumvirs
shut
cicero
out
from
any
leading
part
in
politics
and
he
resumed
his
activity
in
the
his
most
important
case
being
perhaps
the
defence
of
milo
for
the
murder
of
clodius
cicero
most
troublesome
enemy
this
oration
in
the
revised
form
in
which
it
has
come
down
to
us
is
ranked
as
among
the
finest
specimens
of
the
art
of
the
orator
though
in
its
original
form
it
failed
to
secure
milo
acquittal
meantime
cicero
was
also
devoting
much
time
to
literary
composition
and
his
letters
show
great
dejection
over
the
political
situation
and
a
somewhat
wavering
attitude
towards
the
various
parties
in
the
state
in
he
went
to
cilicia
in
asia
minor
as
proconsul
an
office
which
he
administered
with
efficiency
and
integrity
in
civil
affairs
and
with
success
in
military
he
returned
to
italy
in
the
end
of
the
following
year
and
he
was
publicly
thanked
by
the
senate
for
his
services
but
disappointed
in
his
hopes
for
a
triumph
the
war
for
supremacy
between
caesar
and
pompey
which
had
for
some
time
been
gradually
growing
more
certain
broke
out
in
when
caesar
led
his
army
across
the
rubicon
and
cicero
after
much
irresolution
threw
in
his
lot
with
pompey
who
was
overthrown
the
next
year
in
the
battle
of
pharsalus
and
later
murdered
in
egypt
cicero
returned
to
italy
where
caesar
treated
him
magnanimously
and
for
some
time
he
devoted
himself
to
philosophical
and
rhetorical
writing
in
he
divorced
his
wife
terentia
to
whom
he
had
been
married
for
thirty
years
and
married
the
young
and
wealthy
publilia
in
order
to
relieve
himself
from
financial
difficulties
but
her
also
he
shortly
divorced
caesar
who
had
now
become
supreme
in
rome
was
assassinated
in
and
though
cicero
was
not
a
sharer
in
the
conspiracy
he
seems
to
have
approved
the
deed
in
the
confusion
which
followed
he
supported
the
cause
of
the
conspirators
against
antony
and
when
finally
the
triumvirate
of
antony
octavius
and
lepidus
was
established
cicero
was
included
among
the
proscribed
and
on
december
he
was
killed
by
agents
of
antony
his
head
and
hand
were
cut
off
and
exhibited
at
rome
the
most
important
orations
of
the
last
months
of
his
life
were
the
fourteen
philippics
delivered
against
antony
and
the
price
of
this
enmity
he
paid
with
his
life
to
his
contemporaries
cicero
was
primarily
the
great
forensic
and
political
orator
of
his
time
and
the
speeches
which
have
come
down
to
us
bear
testimony
to
the
skill
wit
eloquence
and
passion
which
gave
him
his
but
these
speeches
of
necessity
deal
with
the
minute
details
of
the
occasions
which
called
them
forth
and
so
require
for
their
appreciation
a
full
knowledge
of
the
history
political
and
personal
of
the
time
the
letters
on
the
other
hand
are
less
elaborate
both
in
style
and
in
the
handling
of
current
events
while
they
serve
to
reveal
his
personality
and
to
throw
light
upon
roman
life
in
the
last
days
of
the
republic
in
an
extremely
vivid
fashion
cicero
as
a
man
in
spite
of
his
the
vacillation
of
his
political
conduct
in
desperate
crises
and
the
whining
despondency
of
his
times
of
adversity
stands
out
as
at
bottom
a
patriotic
roman
of
substantial
honesty
who
gave
his
life
to
check
the
inevitable
fall
of
the
commonwealth
to
which
he
was
devoted
the
evils
which
were
undermining
the
republic
bear
so
many
striking
resemblances
to
those
which
threaten
the
civic
and
national
life
of
america
that
the
interest
of
the
period
is
by
no
means
merely
historical
as
a
philosopher
cicero
most
important
function
was
to
make
his
countrymen
familiar
with
the
main
schools
of
greek
thought
much
of
this
writing
is
thus
of
secondary
interest
to
us
in
comparison
with
his
originals
but
in
the
fields
of
religious
theory
and
of
the
application
of
philosophy
to
life
he
made
important
contributions
from
these
works
have
been
selected
the
two
treatises
on
old
age
and
on
friendship
which
have
proved
of
most
permanent
and
widespread
interest
to
posterity
and
which
give
a
clear
impression
of
the
way
in
which
a
roman
thought
about
some
of
the
main
problems
of
human
life
on
friendship
the
augur
quintus
mucius
scaevola
used
to
recount
a
number
of
stories
about
his
galus
laelius
accurately
remembered
and
charmingly
told
and
whenever
he
talked
about
him
always
gave
him
the
title
of
the
wise
without
any
hesitation
i
had
been
introduced
by
my
father
to
scaevola
as
soon
as
i
had
assumed
the
and
i
took
advantage
of
the
introduction
never
to
quit
the
venerable
side
as
long
as
i
was
able
to
stay
and
he
was
spared
to
us
the
consequence
was
that
i
committed
to
memory
many
disquisitions
of
his
as
well
as
many
short
pointed
apophthegms
and
in
short
took
as
much
advantage
of
his
wisdom
as
i
could
when
he
died
i
attached
myself
to
scaevola
the
pontifex
whom
i
may
venture
to
call
quite
the
most
distinguished
of
our
countrymen
for
ability
and
uprightness
but
of
this
latter
i
shall
take
other
occasions
to
speak
to
return
to
scaevola
the
augur
among
many
other
occasions
i
particularly
remember
one
he
was
sitting
on
a
semicircular
as
was
his
custom
when
i
and
a
very
few
intimate
friends
were
there
and
he
chanced
to
turn
the
conversation
upon
a
subject
which
about
that
time
was
in
many
mouths
you
must
remember
atticus
for
you
were
very
intimate
with
publius
sulpicius
what
expressions
of
astonishment
or
even
indignation
were
called
forth
by
his
mortal
quarrel
as
tribune
with
the
consul
quintus
pompeius
with
whom
he
had
formerly
lived
on
terms
of
the
closest
intimacy
and
affection
well
on
this
occasion
happening
to
mention
this
particular
circumstance
scaevola
detailed
to
us
a
discourse
of
laelius
on
friendship
delivered
to
himself
and
other
galus
fannius
son
of
marcus
fannius
a
few
days
after
the
death
of
africanus
the
points
of
that
discussion
i
committed
to
memory
and
have
arranged
them
in
this
book
at
my
own
discretion
for
i
have
brought
the
speakers
as
it
were
personally
on
to
my
stage
to
prevent
the
constant
said
i
and
said
he
of
a
narrative
and
to
give
the
discourse
the
air
of
being
orally
delivered
in
our
hearing
you
have
often
urged
me
to
write
something
on
friendship
and
i
quite
acknowledged
that
the
subject
seemed
one
worth
investigation
and
specially
suited
to
the
close
intimacy
that
has
existed
between
you
and
me
accordingly
i
was
quite
ready
to
benefit
the
public
at
your
request
as
to
the
in
the
treatise
on
old
age
which
i
dedicated
to
you
i
introduced
cato
as
chief
speaker
no
one
i
thought
could
with
greater
propriety
speak
on
old
age
than
one
who
had
been
an
old
man
longer
than
any
one
else
and
had
been
exceptionally
vigorous
in
his
old
age
similarly
having
learnt
from
tradition
that
of
all
friendships
that
between
gaius
laelius
and
publius
scipio
was
the
most
remarkable
i
thought
laelius
was
just
the
person
to
support
the
chief
part
in
a
discussion
on
friendship
which
scaevola
remembered
him
to
have
actually
taken
moreover
a
discussion
of
this
sort
gains
somehow
in
weight
from
the
authority
of
men
of
ancient
days
especially
if
they
happen
to
have
been
distinguished
so
it
comes
about
that
in
reading
over
what
i
have
myself
written
i
have
a
feeling
at
times
that
it
is
actually
cato
that
is
speaking
not
i
finally
as
i
sent
the
former
essay
to
you
as
a
gift
from
one
old
man
to
another
so
i
have
dedicated
this
as
a
most
affectionate
friend
to
his
friend
in
the
former
cato
spoke
who
was
the
oldest
and
wisest
man
of
his
day
in
this
laelius
speaks
on
friendship
laelius
who
was
at
once
a
wise
man
that
was
the
title
given
him
and
eminent
for
his
famous
friendship
please
forget
me
for
a
while
imagine
laelius
to
be
speaking
gaius
fannius
and
quintus
mucius
come
to
call
on
their
after
the
death
of
africanus
they
start
the
subject
laelius
answers
them
and
the
whole
essay
on
friendship
is
his
in
reading
it
you
will
recognise
a
picture
of
yourself
you
are
quite
right
laelius
there
never
was
a
better
or
more
illustrious
character
than
africanus
but
you
should
consider
that
at
the
present
moment
all
eyes
are
on
you
everybody
calls
you
the
wise
and
thinks
you
so
the
same
mark
of
respect
was
lately
paid
cato
and
we
know
that
in
the
last
generation
lucius
atilius
was
called
the
wise
but
in
both
cases
the
word
was
applied
with
a
certain
difference
atilius
was
so
called
from
his
reputation
as
a
jurist
cato
got
the
name
as
a
kind
of
honorary
title
and
in
extreme
old
age
because
of
his
varied
experience
of
affairs
and
his
reputation
for
foresight
and
firmness
and
the
sagacity
of
the
opinions
which
he
delivered
in
senate
and
forum
you
however
are
regarded
as
wise
in
a
somewhat
different
sense
not
alone
on
account
of
natural
ability
and
character
but
also
from
your
industry
and
learning
and
not
in
the
sense
in
which
the
vulgar
but
that
in
which
scholars
give
that
title
in
this
sense
we
do
not
read
of
any
one
being
called
wise
in
greece
except
one
man
at
athens
and
he
to
be
sure
had
been
declared
by
the
oracle
of
apollo
also
to
be
the
supremely
wise
man
for
those
who
commonly
go
by
the
name
of
the
seven
sages
are
not
admitted
into
the
category
of
the
wise
by
fastidious
critics
your
wisdom
people
believe
to
consist
in
this
that
you
look
upon
yourself
as
and
regard
the
changes
and
chances
of
mortal
life
as
powerless
to
affect
your
virtue
accordingly
they
are
always
asking
me
and
doubtless
also
our
scaevola
here
how
you
bear
the
death
of
africanus
this
curiosity
has
been
the
more
excited
from
the
fact
that
on
the
nones
of
this
month
when
we
augurs
met
as
usual
in
the
suburban
villa
of
decimus
brutus
for
consultation
you
were
not
present
though
it
had
always
been
your
habit
to
keep
that
appointment
and
perform
that
duty
with
the
utmost
punctuality
yes
indeed
laelius
i
am
often
asked
the
question
mentioned
by
fannius
but
i
answer
in
accordance
with
what
i
have
observed
i
say
that
you
bear
in
a
reasonable
manner
the
grief
which
you
have
sustained
in
the
death
of
one
who
was
at
once
a
man
of
the
most
illustrious
character
and
a
very
dear
friend
that
of
course
you
could
not
but
be
affected
anything
else
would
have
been
wholly
unnatural
in
a
man
of
your
gentle
nature
but
that
the
cause
of
your
at
our
college
meeting
was
illness
not
melancholy
thanks
scaevola
you
are
quite
right
you
spoke
the
exact
truth
for
in
fact
i
had
no
right
to
allow
myself
to
be
withdrawn
from
a
duty
which
i
had
regularly
performed
as
long
as
i
was
well
by
any
personal
misfortune
nor
do
i
think
that
anything
that
can
happen
will
cause
a
man
of
principle
to
intermit
a
duty
as
for
your
telling
me
fannius
of
the
honourable
appellation
given
me
an
appellation
to
which
i
do
not
recognise
my
title
and
to
which
i
make
no
claim
you
doubtless
act
from
feelings
of
affection
but
i
must
say
that
you
seem
to
me
to
do
less
than
justice
to
cato
if
any
one
was
ever
wise
of
which
i
have
my
doubts
he
was
putting
aside
everything
else
consider
how
he
bore
his
son
death
i
had
not
forgotten
paulus
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
gallus
but
they
lost
their
sons
when
mere
children
cato
his
when
he
was
a
man
with
an
assured
reputation
do
not
therefore
be
in
a
hurry
to
reckon
as
cato
superior
even
that
same
famous
personage
whom
apollo
as
you
say
declared
to
be
the
wisest
remember
the
former
reputation
rests
on
deeds
the
latter
on
words
now
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
speak
to
both
of
you
now
believe
me
the
case
stands
thus
if
i
were
to
say
that
i
am
not
affected
by
regret
for
scipio
i
must
leave
the
philosophers
to
justify
my
conduct
but
in
point
of
fact
i
should
be
telling
a
lie
affected
of
course
i
am
by
the
loss
of
a
friend
as
i
think
there
will
never
be
again
such
as
i
can
fearlessly
say
there
never
was
before
but
i
stand
in
no
need
of
medicine
i
can
find
my
own
consolation
and
it
consists
chiefly
in
my
being
free
from
the
mistaken
notion
which
generally
causes
pain
at
the
departure
of
friends
to
scipio
i
am
convinced
no
evil
has
befallen
mine
is
the
disaster
if
disaster
there
be
and
to
be
severely
distressed
at
one
own
misfortunes
does
not
show
that
you
love
your
friend
but
that
you
love
yourself
as
for
him
who
can
say
that
all
is
not
more
than
well
for
unless
he
had
taken
the
fancy
to
wish
for
immortality
the
last
thing
of
which
he
ever
thought
what
is
there
for
which
mortal
man
may
wish
that
he
did
not
attain
in
his
early
manhood
he
more
than
justified
by
extraordinary
personal
courage
the
hopes
which
his
had
conceived
of
him
as
a
child
he
never
was
a
candidate
for
the
consulship
yet
was
elected
consul
twice
the
first
time
before
the
legal
age
the
second
at
a
time
which
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
soon
enough
but
was
near
being
too
late
for
the
interests
of
the
state
by
the
overthrow
of
two
cities
which
were
the
most
bitter
enemies
of
our
empire
he
put
an
end
not
only
to
the
wars
then
raging
but
also
to
the
possibility
of
others
in
the
future
what
need
to
mention
the
exquisite
grace
of
his
manners
his
dutiful
devotion
to
his
mother
his
generosity
to
his
sisters
his
liberality
to
his
relations
the
integrity
of
his
conduct
to
every
one
you
know
all
this
already
finally
the
estimation
in
which
his
held
him
has
been
shown
by
the
signs
of
mourning
which
accompanied
his
obsequies
what
could
such
a
man
have
gained
by
the
addition
of
a
few
years
though
age
need
not
be
a
burden
as
i
remember
cato
arguing
in
the
presence
of
myself
and
scipio
two
years
before
he
died
yet
it
can
not
but
take
away
the
vigour
and
freshness
which
scipio
was
still
enjoying
we
may
conclude
therefore
that
his
life
from
the
good
fortune
which
had
attended
him
and
the
glory
he
had
obtained
was
so
circumstanced
that
it
could
not
be
bettered
while
the
suddenness
of
his
death
saved
him
the
sensation
of
dying
as
to
the
manner
of
his
death
it
is
difficult
to
speak
you
see
what
people
suspect
thus
much
however
i
may
say
scipio
in
his
lifetime
saw
many
days
of
supreme
triumph
and
exultation
but
none
more
magnificent
than
his
last
on
which
upon
the
rising
of
the
senate
he
was
escorted
by
the
senators
and
the
people
of
rome
by
the
allies
and
by
the
latins
to
his
own
door
from
such
an
elevation
of
popular
esteem
the
next
step
seems
naturally
to
be
an
ascent
to
the
gods
above
rather
than
a
descent
to
hades
for
i
am
not
one
of
these
modern
philosophers
who
maintain
that
our
souls
perish
with
our
bodies
and
that
death
ends
all
with
me
ancient
opinion
has
more
weight
whether
it
be
that
of
our
own
ancestors
who
attributed
such
solemn
observances
to
the
dead
as
they
plainly
would
not
have
done
if
they
had
believed
them
to
be
wholly
annihilated
or
that
of
the
philosophers
who
once
visited
this
country
and
who
by
their
maxims
and
doctrines
educated
magna
graecia
which
at
that
time
was
in
a
flourishing
condition
though
it
has
now
been
ruined
or
that
of
the
man
who
was
declared
by
apollo
oracle
to
be
most
wise
and
who
used
to
teach
without
the
variation
which
is
to
be
found
in
most
philosophers
that
the
souls
of
men
are
divine
and
that
when
they
have
quitted
the
body
a
return
to
heaven
is
open
to
them
least
difficult
to
those
who
have
been
most
virtuous
and
just
this
opinion
was
shared
by
scipio
only
a
few
days
before
his
death
as
though
he
had
a
presentiment
of
what
was
coming
he
discoursed
for
three
days
on
the
state
of
the
republic
the
company
consisted
of
philus
and
manlius
and
several
others
and
i
had
brought
you
scaevola
along
with
me
the
last
part
of
his
discourse
referred
principally
to
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
he
told
us
what
he
had
heard
from
the
elder
africanus
in
a
dream
now
if
it
be
true
that
in
proportion
to
a
man
goodness
the
escape
from
what
may
be
called
the
prison
and
bonds
of
the
flesh
is
easiest
whom
can
we
imagine
to
have
had
an
easier
voyage
to
the
gods
than
scipio
i
am
disposed
to
think
therefore
that
in
his
case
mourning
would
be
a
sign
of
envy
rather
than
of
friendship
if
however
the
truth
rather
is
that
the
body
and
soul
perish
together
and
that
no
sensation
remains
then
though
there
is
nothing
good
in
death
at
least
there
is
nothing
bad
remove
sensation
and
a
man
is
exactly
as
though
he
had
never
been
born
and
yet
that
this
man
was
born
is
a
joy
to
me
and
will
be
a
subject
of
rejoicing
to
this
state
to
its
last
hour
wherefore
as
i
said
before
all
is
as
well
as
possible
with
him
not
so
with
me
for
as
i
entered
life
before
him
it
would
have
been
fairer
for
me
to
leave
it
also
before
him
yet
such
is
the
pleasure
i
take
in
recalling
our
friendship
that
i
look
upon
my
life
as
having
been
a
happy
one
because
i
have
spent
it
with
scipio
with
him
i
was
associated
in
public
and
private
business
with
him
i
lived
in
rome
and
served
abroad
and
between
us
there
was
the
most
complete
harmony
in
our
tastes
our
pursuits
and
our
sentiments
which
is
the
true
secret
of
friendship
it
is
not
therefore
in
that
reputation
for
wisdom
mentioned
just
now
by
fannius
especially
as
it
happens
to
be
groundless
that
i
find
my
happiness
so
much
as
in
the
hope
that
the
memory
of
our
friendship
will
be
lasting
what
makes
me
care
the
more
about
this
is
the
fact
that
in
all
history
there
are
scarcely
three
or
four
pairs
of
friends
on
record
and
it
is
classed
with
them
that
i
cherish
a
hope
of
the
friendship
of
scipio
and
laelius
being
known
to
posterity
of
course
that
must
be
so
laelius
but
since
you
have
mentioned
the
word
friendship
and
we
are
at
leisure
you
would
be
doing
me
a
great
kindness
and
i
expect
scaevola
also
if
you
would
do
as
it
is
your
habit
to
do
when
asked
questions
on
other
subjects
and
tell
us
your
sentiments
about
friendship
its
nature
and
the
rules
to
be
observed
in
regard
to
it
i
shall
of
course
be
delighted
fannius
has
anticipated
the
very
request
i
was
about
to
make
so
you
will
be
doing
us
both
a
great
favour
i
should
certainly
have
no
objection
if
i
felt
confidence
in
myself
for
the
theme
is
a
noble
one
and
we
are
as
fannius
has
said
at
leisure
but
who
am
i
and
what
ability
have
i
what
you
propose
is
all
very
well
for
professional
philosophers
who
are
used
particularly
if
greeks
to
have
the
subject
for
discussion
proposed
to
them
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
is
a
task
of
considerable
difficulty
and
requires
no
little
practice
therefore
for
a
set
discourse
on
friendship
you
must
go
i
think
to
professional
lecturers
all
i
can
do
is
to
urge
on
you
to
regard
friendship
as
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
for
there
is
nothing
which
so
fits
in
with
our
nature
or
is
so
exactly
what
we
want
in
prosperity
or
adversity
but
i
must
at
the
very
beginning
lay
down
this
principle
can
only
exist
between
good
i
do
not
however
press
this
too
closely
like
the
philosophers
who
push
their
definitions
to
a
superfluous
accuracy
they
have
truth
on
their
side
perhaps
but
it
is
of
no
practical
advantage
those
i
mean
who
say
that
no
one
but
the
wise
is
good
granted
by
all
means
but
the
wisdom
they
mean
is
one
to
which
no
mortal
ever
yet
attained
we
must
concern
ourselves
with
the
facts
of
everyday
life
as
we
find
it
not
imaginary
and
ideal
perfections
even
gaius
fannius
manius
curius
and
tiberius
coruncanius
whom
our
ancestors
decided
to
be
wise
i
could
never
declare
to
be
so
according
to
their
standard
let
them
then
keep
this
word
wisdom
to
themselves
everybody
is
irritated
by
it
no
one
understands
what
it
means
let
them
but
grant
that
the
men
i
mentioned
were
good
no
they
wo
do
that
either
no
one
but
the
wise
can
be
allowed
that
title
say
they
well
then
let
us
dismiss
them
and
manage
as
best
we
may
with
our
own
poor
mother
wit
as
the
phrase
is
we
mean
then
by
the
good
whose
actions
and
lives
leave
no
question
as
to
their
honour
purity
equity
and
liberality
who
are
free
from
greed
lust
and
violence
and
who
have
the
courage
of
their
the
men
i
have
just
named
may
serve
as
examples
such
men
as
these
being
generally
accounted
good
let
us
agree
to
call
them
so
on
the
ground
that
to
the
best
of
human
ability
they
follow
nature
as
the
most
perfect
guide
to
a
good
life
now
this
truth
seems
clear
to
me
that
nature
has
so
formed
us
that
a
certain
tie
unites
us
all
but
that
this
tie
becomes
stronger
from
proximity
so
it
is
that
are
preferred
in
our
affections
to
foreigners
relations
to
strangers
for
in
their
case
nature
herself
has
caused
a
kind
of
friendship
to
exist
though
it
is
one
which
lacks
some
of
the
elements
of
permanence
friendship
excels
relationship
in
this
that
whereas
you
may
eliminate
affection
from
relationship
you
can
not
do
so
from
friendship
without
it
relationship
still
exists
in
name
friendship
does
not
you
may
best
understand
this
friendship
by
considering
that
whereas
the
merely
natural
ties
uniting
the
human
race
are
indefinite
this
one
is
so
concentrated
and
confined
to
so
narrow
a
sphere
that
affection
is
ever
shared
by
two
persons
only
or
at
most
by
a
few
now
friendship
may
be
thus
defined
a
complete
accord
on
all
subjects
human
and
divine
joined
with
mutual
goodwill
and
affection
and
with
the
exception
of
wisdom
i
am
inclined
to
think
nothing
better
than
this
has
been
given
to
man
by
the
immortal
gods
there
are
people
who
give
the
palm
to
riches
or
to
good
health
or
to
power
and
office
many
even
to
sensual
pleasures
this
last
is
the
ideal
of
brute
beasts
and
of
the
others
we
may
say
that
they
are
frail
and
uncertain
and
depend
less
on
our
own
prudence
than
on
the
caprice
of
fortune
then
there
are
those
who
find
the
chief
good
in
virtue
well
that
is
a
noble
doctrine
but
the
very
virtue
they
talk
of
is
the
parent
and
preserver
of
friendship
and
without
it
friendship
can
not
possibly
exist
let
us
i
repeat
use
the
word
virtue
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
and
meaning
of
the
term
and
do
not
let
us
define
it
in
language
let
us
account
as
good
the
persons
usually
considered
so
such
as
paulus
cato
gallus
scipio
and
philus
such
men
as
these
are
good
enough
for
everyday
life
and
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
those
ideal
characters
which
are
nowhere
to
be
met
with
well
between
men
like
these
the
advantages
of
friendship
are
almost
more
than
i
can
say
to
begin
with
how
can
life
be
worth
living
to
use
the
words
of
ennius
which
lacks
that
repose
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
mutual
of
a
friend
what
can
be
more
delightful
than
to
have
some
one
to
whom
you
can
say
everything
with
the
same
absolute
confidence
as
to
yourself
is
not
prosperity
robbed
of
half
its
value
if
you
have
no
one
to
share
your
joy
on
the
other
hand
misfortunes
would
be
hard
to
bear
if
there
were
not
some
one
to
feel
them
even
more
acutely
than
yourself
in
a
word
other
objects
of
ambition
serve
for
particular
ends
riches
for
use
power
for
securing
homage
office
for
reputation
pleasure
for
enjoyment
health
for
freedom
from
pain
and
the
full
use
of
the
functions
of
the
body
but
friendship
embraces
innumerable
advantages
turn
which
way
you
please
you
will
find
it
at
hand
it
is
everywhere
and
yet
never
out
of
place
never
unwelcome
fire
and
water
themselves
to
use
a
common
expression
are
not
of
more
universal
use
than
friendship
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
the
common
or
modified
form
of
it
though
even
that
is
a
source
of
pleasure
and
profit
but
of
that
true
and
complete
friendship
which
existed
between
the
select
few
who
are
known
to
fame
such
friendship
enhances
prosperity
and
relieves
adversity
of
its
burden
by
halving
and
sharing
it
and
great
and
numerous
as
are
the
blessings
of
friendship
this
certainly
is
the
sovereign
one
that
it
gives
us
bright
hopes
for
the
future
and
forbids
weakness
and
despair
in
the
face
of
a
true
friend
a
man
sees
as
it
were
a
second
self
so
that
where
his
friend
is
he
is
if
his
friend
be
rich
he
is
not
poor
though
he
be
weak
his
strength
is
his
and
in
his
friend
life
he
enjoys
a
second
life
after
his
own
is
finished
this
last
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
to
conceive
but
such
is
the
effect
of
the
respect
the
loving
remembrance
and
the
regret
of
friends
which
follow
us
to
the
grave
while
they
take
the
sting
out
of
death
they
add
a
glory
to
the
life
of
the
survivors
nay
if
you
eliminate
from
nature
the
tie
of
affection
there
will
be
an
end
of
house
and
city
nor
will
so
much
as
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
be
left
if
you
do
see
the
virtue
of
friendship
and
harmony
you
may
learn
it
by
observing
the
effects
of
quarrels
and
feuds
was
any
family
ever
so
well
established
any
state
so
firmly
settled
as
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
utter
destruction
from
animosities
and
factions
this
may
teach
you
the
immense
advantage
of
friendship
they
say
that
a
certain
philosopher
of
agrigentum
in
a
greek
poem
pronounced
with
the
authority
of
an
oracle
the
doctrine
that
whatever
in
nature
and
the
universe
was
unchangeable
was
so
in
virtue
of
the
binding
force
of
friendship
whatever
was
changeable
was
so
by
the
solvent
power
of
discord
and
indeed
this
is
a
truth
which
everybody
understands
and
practically
attests
by
experience
for
if
any
marked
instance
of
loyal
friendship
in
confronting
or
sharing
danger
comes
to
light
every
one
applauds
it
to
the
echo
what
cheers
there
were
for
instance
all
over
the
theatre
at
a
passage
in
the
new
play
of
my
friend
and
guest
pacuvius
where
the
king
not
knowing
which
of
the
two
was
orestes
pylades
declared
himself
to
be
orestes
that
he
might
die
in
his
stead
while
the
real
orestes
kept
on
asserting
that
it
was
he
the
audience
rose
and
clapped
their
hands
and
this
was
at
an
incident
in
fiction
what
would
they
have
done
must
we
suppose
if
it
had
been
in
real
life
you
can
easily
see
what
a
natural
feeling
it
is
when
men
who
would
not
have
had
the
resolution
to
act
thus
themselves
shewed
how
right
they
thought
it
in
another
i
do
think
i
have
any
more
to
say
about
friendship
if
there
is
any
more
and
i
have
no
doubt
there
is
much
you
must
if
you
care
to
do
so
consult
those
who
profess
to
discuss
such
matters
we
would
rather
apply
to
you
yet
i
have
often
consulted
such
persons
and
have
heard
what
they
had
to
say
with
a
certain
satisfaction
but
in
your
discourse
one
somehow
feels
that
there
is
a
different
strain
you
would
have
said
that
still
more
fannius
if
you
had
been
present
the
other
day
in
scipio
when
we
had
the
discussion
about
the
state
how
splendidly
he
stood
up
for
justice
against
philus
elaborate
speech
ah
it
was
naturally
easy
for
the
justest
of
men
to
stand
up
for
justice
well
then
what
about
friendship
who
could
discourse
on
it
more
easily
than
the
man
whose
chief
glory
is
a
friendship
maintained
with
the
most
absolute
fidelity
constancy
and
integrity
now
you
are
really
using
force
it
makes
no
difference
what
kind
of
force
you
use
force
it
is
for
it
is
neither
easy
nor
right
to
refuse
a
wish
of
my
particularly
when
the
wish
is
a
creditable
one
in
itself
well
then
it
has
very
often
occurred
to
me
when
thinking
about
friendship
that
the
chief
point
to
be
considered
was
this
is
it
weakness
and
want
of
means
that
make
friendship
desired
i
mean
is
its
object
an
interchange
of
good
offices
so
that
each
may
give
that
in
which
he
is
strong
and
receive
that
in
which
he
is
weak
or
is
it
not
rather
true
that
although
this
is
an
advantage
naturally
belonging
to
friendship
yet
its
original
cause
is
quite
other
prior
in
time
more
noble
in
character
and
springing
more
directly
from
our
nature
itself
the
latin
word
for
friendship
is
derived
from
that
for
love
and
love
is
certainly
the
prime
mover
in
contracting
mutual
affection
for
as
to
material
advantages
it
often
happens
that
those
are
obtained
even
by
men
who
are
courted
by
a
mere
show
of
friendship
and
treated
with
respect
from
interested
motives
but
friendship
by
its
nature
admits
of
no
feigning
no
pretence
as
far
as
it
goes
it
is
both
genuine
and
spontaneous
therefore
i
gather
that
friendship
springs
from
a
natural
impulse
rather
than
a
wish
for
help
from
an
inclination
of
the
heart
combined
with
a
certain
instinctive
feeling
of
love
rather
than
from
a
deliberate
calculation
of
the
material
advantage
it
was
likely
to
confer
the
strength
of
this
feeling
you
may
notice
in
certain
animals
they
show
such
love
to
their
offspring
for
a
certain
period
and
are
so
beloved
by
them
that
they
clearly
have
a
share
in
this
natural
instinctive
affection
but
of
course
it
is
more
evident
in
the
case
of
man
first
in
the
natural
affection
between
children
and
their
parents
an
affection
which
only
shocking
wickedness
can
sunder
and
next
when
the
passion
of
love
has
attained
to
a
like
strength
on
our
finding
that
is
some
one
person
with
whose
character
and
nature
we
are
in
full
sympathy
because
we
think
that
we
perceive
in
him
what
i
may
call
the
of
virtue
for
nothing
inspires
love
nothing
conciliates
affection
like
virtue
why
in
a
certain
sense
we
may
be
said
to
feel
affection
even
for
men
we
have
never
seen
owing
to
their
honesty
and
virtue
who
for
instance
fails
to
dwell
on
the
memory
of
gaius
fabricius
and
manius
curius
with
some
affection
and
warmth
of
feeling
though
he
has
never
seen
them
or
who
but
loathes
tarquinius
superbus
spurius
cassius
spurius
maelius
we
have
fought
for
empire
in
italy
with
two
great
generals
pyrrhus
and
hannibal
for
the
former
owing
to
his
probity
we
entertain
no
great
feelings
of
enmity
the
latter
owing
to
his
cruelty
our
country
has
detested
and
always
will
detest
now
if
the
attraction
of
probity
is
so
great
that
we
can
love
it
not
only
in
those
whom
we
have
never
seen
but
what
is
more
actually
in
an
enemy
we
need
not
be
surprised
if
men
affections
are
roused
when
they
fancy
that
they
have
seen
virtue
and
goodness
in
those
with
whom
a
close
intimacy
is
possible
i
do
not
deny
that
affection
is
strengthened
by
the
actual
receipt
of
benefits
as
well
as
by
the
perception
of
a
wish
to
render
service
combined
with
a
closer
intercourse
when
these
are
added
to
the
original
impulse
of
the
heart
to
which
i
have
alluded
a
quite
surprising
warmth
of
feeling
springs
up
and
if
any
one
thinks
that
this
comes
from
a
sense
of
weakness
that
each
may
have
some
one
to
help
him
to
his
particular
need
all
i
can
say
is
that
when
he
maintains
it
to
be
born
of
want
and
poverty
he
allows
to
friendship
an
origin
very
base
and
a
pedigree
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
far
from
noble
if
this
had
been
the
case
a
man
inclination
to
friendship
would
be
exactly
in
proportion
to
his
low
opinion
of
his
own
resources
whereas
the
truth
is
quite
the
other
way
for
when
a
confidence
in
himself
is
greatest
when
he
is
so
fortified
by
virtue
and
wisdom
as
to
want
nothing
and
to
feel
absolutely
it
is
then
that
he
is
most
conspicuous
for
seeking
out
and
keeping
up
friendships
did
africanus
for
example
want
anything
of
me
not
the
least
in
the
world
neither
did
i
of
him
in
my
case
it
was
an
admiration
of
his
virtue
in
his
an
opinion
may
be
which
he
entertained
of
my
character
that
caused
our
affection
closer
intimacy
added
to
the
warmth
of
our
feelings
but
though
many
great
material
advantages
did
ensue
they
were
not
the
source
from
which
our
affection
proceeded
for
as
we
are
not
beneficent
and
liberal
with
any
view
of
extorting
gratitude
and
do
not
regard
an
act
of
kindness
as
an
investment
but
follow
a
natural
inclination
to
liberality
so
we
look
on
friendship
as
worth
trying
for
not
because
we
are
attracted
to
it
by
the
expectation
of
ulterior
gain
but
in
the
conviction
that
what
it
has
to
give
us
is
from
first
to
last
included
in
the
feeling
itself
far
different
is
the
view
of
those
who
like
brute
beasts
refer
everything
to
sensual
pleasure
and
no
wonder
men
who
have
degraded
all
their
powers
of
thought
to
an
object
so
mean
and
contemptible
can
of
course
raise
their
eyes
to
nothing
lofty
to
nothing
grand
and
divine
such
persons
indeed
let
us
leave
out
of
the
present
question
and
let
us
accept
the
doctrine
that
the
sensation
of
love
and
the
warmth
of
inclination
have
their
origin
in
a
spontaneous
feeling
which
arises
directly
the
presence
of
probity
is
indicated
when
once
men
have
conceived
the
inclination
they
of
course
try
to
attach
themselves
to
the
object
of
it
and
move
themselves
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
their
aim
is
that
they
may
be
on
the
same
footing
and
the
same
level
in
regard
to
affection
and
be
more
inclined
to
do
a
good
service
than
to
ask
a
return
and
that
there
should
be
this
noble
rivalry
between
them
thus
both
truths
will
be
established
we
shall
get
the
most
important
material
advantages
from
friendship
and
its
origin
from
a
natural
impulse
rather
than
from
a
sense
of
need
will
be
at
once
more
dignified
and
more
in
accordance
with
fact
for
if
it
were
true
that
its
material
advantages
cemented
friendship
it
would
be
equally
true
that
any
change
in
them
would
dissolve
it
but
nature
being
incapable
of
change
it
follows
that
genuine
friendships
are
eternal
so
much
for
the
origin
of
friendship
but
perhaps
you
would
not
care
to
hear
any
more
nay
pray
go
on
let
us
have
the
rest
laelius
i
take
on
myself
to
speak
for
my
friend
here
as
his
senior
quite
right
therefore
pray
let
us
hear
well
then
my
good
friends
listen
to
some
conversations
about
friendship
which
very
frequently
passed
between
scipio
and
myself
i
must
begin
by
telling
you
however
that
he
used
to
say
that
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
was
for
a
friendship
to
remain
unimpaired
to
the
end
of
life
so
many
things
might
intervene
conflicting
interests
differences
of
opinion
in
politics
frequent
changes
in
character
owing
sometimes
to
misfortunes
sometimes
to
advancing
years
he
used
to
illustrate
these
facts
from
the
analogy
of
boyhood
since
the
warmest
affections
between
boys
are
often
laid
aside
with
the
boyish
toga
and
even
if
they
did
manage
to
keep
them
up
to
adolescence
they
were
sometimes
broken
by
a
rivalry
in
courtship
or
for
some
other
advantage
to
which
their
mutual
claims
were
not
compatible
even
if
the
friendship
was
prolonged
beyond
that
time
yet
it
frequently
received
a
rude
shock
should
the
two
happen
to
be
competitors
for
office
for
while
the
most
fatal
blow
to
friendship
in
the
majority
of
cases
was
the
lust
of
gold
in
the
case
of
the
best
men
it
was
a
rivalry
for
office
and
reputation
by
which
it
had
often
happened
that
the
most
violent
enmity
had
arisen
between
the
closest
friends
again
wide
breaches
and
for
the
most
part
justifiable
ones
were
caused
by
an
immoral
request
being
made
of
friends
to
pander
to
a
unholy
desires
or
to
assist
him
in
inflicting
a
wrong
a
refusal
though
perfectly
right
is
attacked
by
those
to
whom
they
refuse
compliance
as
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
friendship
now
the
people
who
have
no
scruples
as
to
the
requests
they
make
to
their
friends
thereby
allow
that
they
are
ready
to
have
no
scruples
as
to
what
they
will
do
for
their
friends
and
it
is
the
recriminations
of
such
people
which
commonly
not
only
quench
friendships
but
give
rise
to
lasting
enmities
in
fact
he
used
to
say
these
fatalities
overhang
friendship
in
such
numbers
that
it
requires
not
only
wisdom
but
good
luck
also
to
escape
them
all
with
these
premises
then
let
us
first
if
you
please
examine
the
question
how
far
ought
personal
feeling
to
go
in
friendship
for
instance
suppose
coriolanus
to
have
had
friends
ought
they
to
have
joined
him
in
invading
his
country
again
in
the
case
of
vecellinus
or
spurius
maelius
ought
their
friends
to
have
assisted
them
in
their
attempt
to
establish
a
tyranny
take
two
instances
of
either
line
of
conduct
when
tiberius
gracchus
attempted
his
revolutionary
measures
he
was
deserted
as
we
saw
by
quintus
tubero
and
the
friends
of
his
own
standing
on
the
other
hand
a
friend
of
your
own
family
scaevola
gains
blossius
of
cumae
took
a
different
course
i
was
acting
as
assessor
to
the
consuls
laenas
and
rupilius
to
try
the
conspirators
and
blossius
pleaded
for
my
pardon
on
the
ground
that
his
regard
for
tiberius
gracchus
had
been
so
high
that
he
looked
upon
his
wishes
as
law
even
if
he
had
wished
you
to
set
fire
to
the
capitol
said
i
that
is
a
thing
he
replied
that
he
never
would
have
wished
ah
but
if
he
had
wished
it
said
i
i
would
have
obeyed
the
wickedness
of
such
a
speech
needs
no
comment
and
in
point
of
fact
he
was
as
good
and
better
than
his
word
for
he
did
not
wait
for
orders
in
the
audacious
proceedings
of
tiberius
gracchus
but
was
the
head
and
front
of
them
and
was
a
leader
rather
than
an
abettor
of
his
madness
the
result
of
his
infatuation
was
that
he
fled
to
asia
terrified
by
the
special
commission
appointed
to
try
him
joined
the
enemies
of
his
country
and
paid
a
penalty
to
the
republic
as
heavy
as
it
was
deserved
i
conclude
then
that
the
plea
of
having
acted
in
the
interests
of
a
friend
is
not
a
valid
excuse
for
a
wrong
action
for
seeing
that
a
belief
in
a
virtue
is
the
original
cause
of
friendship
friendship
can
hardly
remain
if
virtue
he
abandoned
but
if
we
decide
it
to
be
right
to
grant
our
friends
whatever
they
wish
and
to
ask
them
for
whatever
we
wish
perfect
wisdom
must
be
assumed
on
both
sides
if
no
mischief
is
to
happen
but
we
can
not
assume
this
perfect
wisdom
for
we
are
speaking
only
of
such
friends
as
are
ordinarily
to
be
met
with
whether
we
have
actually
seen
them
or
have
been
told
about
them
men
that
is
to
say
of
everyday
life
i
must
quote
some
examples
of
such
persons
taking
care
to
select
such
as
approach
nearest
to
our
standard
of
wisdom
we
read
for
instance
that
papus
aemilius
was
a
close
friend
of
gaius
luscinus
history
tells
us
that
they
were
twice
consuls
together
and
colleagues
in
the
censorship
again
it
is
on
record
that
manius
curius
and
tiberius
coruncanius
were
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
them
and
with
each
other
now
we
can
not
even
suspect
that
any
one
of
these
men
ever
asked
of
his
friend
anything
that
militated
against
his
honour
or
his
oath
or
the
interests
of
the
republic
in
the
case
of
such
men
as
these
there
is
no
point
in
saying
that
one
of
them
would
not
have
obtained
such
a
request
if
he
had
made
it
for
they
were
men
of
the
most
scrupulous
piety
and
the
making
of
such
a
request
would
involve
a
breach
of
religious
obligation
no
less
than
the
granting
it
however
it
is
quite
true
that
gaius
carbo
and
gaius
cato
did
follow
tiberius
gracchus
and
though
his
brother
caius
gracchus
did
not
do
so
at
the
time
he
is
now
the
most
eager
of
them
all
we
may
then
lay
down
this
rule
of
friendship
neither
ask
nor
consent
to
do
what
is
wrong
for
the
plea
for
friendship
sake
is
a
discreditable
one
and
not
to
be
admitted
for
a
moment
this
rule
holds
good
for
all
but
more
especially
in
such
as
involves
disloyalty
to
the
republic
for
things
have
come
to
such
a
point
with
us
my
dear
fannius
and
scaevola
that
we
are
bound
to
look
somewhat
far
ahead
to
what
is
likely
to
happen
to
the
republic
the
constitution
as
known
to
our
ancestors
has
already
swerved
somewhat
from
the
regular
course
and
the
lines
marked
out
for
it
tiberius
gracchus
made
an
attempt
to
obtain
the
power
of
a
king
or
i
might
rather
say
enjoyed
that
power
for
a
few
months
had
the
roman
people
ever
heard
or
seen
the
like
before
what
the
friends
and
connexions
that
followed
him
even
after
his
death
have
succeeded
in
doing
in
the
case
of
publius
scipio
i
can
not
describe
without
tears
as
for
carbo
thanks
to
the
punishment
recently
inflicted
on
tiberius
gracchus
we
have
by
hook
or
by
crook
managed
to
hold
out
against
his
attacks
but
what
to
expect
of
the
tribuneship
of
caius
gracchus
i
do
not
like
to
forecast
one
thing
leads
to
another
and
once
set
going
the
downward
course
proceeds
with
velocity
there
is
the
case
of
the
ballot
what
a
blow
was
inflicted
first
by
the
lex
gabinia
and
two
years
afterwards
by
the
lex
cassia
i
seem
already
to
see
the
people
estranged
from
the
senate
and
the
most
important
affairs
at
the
mercy
of
the
multitude
for
you
may
be
sure
that
more
people
will
learn
how
to
set
such
things
in
motion
than
how
to
stop
them
what
is
the
point
of
these
remarks
this
no
one
ever
makes
any
attempt
of
this
sort
without
friends
to
help
him
we
must
therefore
impress
upon
good
men
that
should
they
become
inevitably
involved
in
friendships
with
men
of
this
kind
they
ought
not
to
consider
themselves
under
any
obligation
to
stand
by
friends
who
are
disloyal
to
the
republic
bad
men
must
have
the
fear
of
punishment
before
their
eyes
a
punishment
not
less
severe
for
those
who
follow
than
for
those
who
lead
others
to
crime
who
was
more
famous
and
powerful
in
greece
than
themistocles
at
the
head
of
the
army
in
the
persian
war
he
had
freed
greece
he
owed
his
exile
to
personal
envy
but
he
did
not
submit
to
the
wrong
done
him
by
his
ungrateful
country
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
acted
as
coriolanus
had
acted
among
us
twenty
years
before
but
no
one
was
found
to
help
them
in
their
attacks
upon
their
fatherland
both
of
them
accordingly
committed
suicide
we
conclude
then
not
only
that
no
such
confederation
of
evilly
disposed
men
must
be
allowed
to
shelter
itself
under
the
plea
of
friendship
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
must
be
visited
with
the
severest
punishment
lest
the
idea
should
prevail
that
fidelity
to
a
friend
justifies
even
making
war
upon
one
country
and
this
is
a
case
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
considering
how
things
are
beginning
to
go
will
sooner
or
later
arise
and
i
care
quite
as
much
what
the
state
of
the
constitution
will
be
after
my
death
as
what
it
is
now
let
this
then
be
laid
down
as
the
first
law
of
friendship
that
should
ask
from
friends
and
do
for
friends
only
what
is
but
do
not
let
us
wait
to
be
asked
either
let
there
be
ever
an
eager
readiness
and
an
absence
of
hesitation
let
us
have
the
courage
to
give
advice
with
candour
in
friendship
let
the
influence
of
friends
who
give
good
advice
be
paramount
and
let
this
influence
be
used
to
enforce
advice
not
only
in
terms
but
sometimes
if
the
case
demands
it
with
sharpness
and
when
so
used
let
it
be
obeyed
i
give
you
these
rules
because
i
believe
that
some
wonderful
opinions
are
entertained
by
certain
persons
who
have
i
am
told
a
reputation
for
wisdom
in
greece
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
by
the
way
beyond
the
reach
of
their
sophistry
well
some
of
them
teach
that
we
should
avoid
very
close
friendships
for
fear
that
one
man
should
have
to
endure
the
anxieties
of
several
each
man
say
they
has
enough
and
to
spare
on
his
own
hands
it
is
too
bad
to
be
involved
in
the
cares
of
other
people
the
wisest
course
is
to
hold
the
reins
of
friendship
as
loose
as
possible
you
can
then
tighten
or
slacken
them
at
your
will
for
the
first
condition
of
a
happy
life
is
freedom
from
care
which
no
mind
can
enjoy
if
it
has
to
travail
so
to
speak
for
others
besides
itself
another
sect
i
am
told
gives
vent
to
opinions
still
less
generous
i
briefly
touched
on
this
subject
just
now
they
affirm
that
friendships
should
be
sought
solely
for
the
sake
of
the
assistance
they
give
and
not
at
all
from
motives
of
feeling
and
affection
and
that
therefore
just
in
proportion
as
a
man
power
and
means
of
support
are
lowest
he
is
most
eager
to
gain
friendships
thence
it
comes
that
weak
women
seek
the
support
of
friendship
more
than
men
the
poor
more
than
the
rich
the
unfortunate
rather
than
those
esteemed
prosperous
what
noble
philosophy
you
might
just
as
well
take
the
sun
out
of
the
sky
as
friendship
from
life
for
the
immortal
gods
have
given
us
nothing
better
or
more
delightful
but
let
us
examine
the
two
doctrines
what
is
the
value
of
this
freedom
from
care
it
is
very
tempting
at
first
sight
but
in
practice
it
has
in
many
cases
to
be
put
on
one
side
for
there
is
no
business
and
no
course
of
action
demanded
from
us
by
our
honour
which
you
can
consistently
decline
or
lay
aside
when
begun
from
a
mere
wish
to
escape
from
anxiety
nay
if
we
wish
to
avoid
anxiety
we
must
avoid
virtue
itself
which
necessarily
involves
some
anxious
thoughts
in
showing
its
loathing
and
abhorrence
for
the
qualities
which
are
opposite
to
itself
as
kindness
for
for
licentiousness
courage
for
cowardice
thus
you
may
notice
that
it
is
the
just
who
are
most
pained
at
injustice
the
brave
at
cowardly
actions
the
temperate
at
depravity
it
is
then
characteristic
of
a
rightly
ordered
mind
to
be
pleased
at
what
is
good
and
grieved
at
the
reverse
seeing
then
that
the
wise
are
not
exempt
from
the
which
must
be
the
case
unless
we
suppose
all
human
nature
rooted
out
of
their
hearts
why
should
we
banish
friendship
from
our
lives
for
fear
of
being
involved
by
it
in
some
amount
of
distress
if
you
take
away
emotion
what
difference
remains
i
do
say
between
a
man
and
a
beast
but
between
a
man
and
a
stone
or
a
log
of
wood
or
anything
else
of
that
kind
neither
should
we
give
any
weight
to
the
doctrine
that
virtue
is
something
rigid
and
unyielding
as
iron
in
point
of
fact
it
is
in
regard
to
friendship
as
in
so
many
other
things
so
supple
and
sensitive
that
it
expands
so
to
speak
at
a
friend
good
fortune
contracts
at
his
misfortunes
we
conclude
then
that
mental
pain
which
we
must
often
encounter
on
a
friend
account
is
not
of
sufficient
consequence
to
banish
friendship
from
our
life
any
more
than
it
is
true
that
the
cardinal
virtues
are
to
be
dispensed
with
because
they
involve
certain
anxieties
and
distresses
let
me
repeat
then
the
clear
indication
of
virtue
to
which
a
mind
of
like
character
is
naturally
attracted
is
the
beginning
of
friendship
when
that
is
the
case
the
rise
of
affection
is
a
necessity
for
what
can
be
more
irrational
than
to
take
delight
in
many
objects
incapable
of
response
such
as
office
fame
splendid
buildings
and
personal
decoration
and
yet
to
take
little
or
none
in
a
sentient
being
endowed
with
virtue
which
has
the
faculty
of
loving
or
if
i
may
use
the
expression
loving
back
for
nothing
is
really
more
delightful
than
a
return
of
affection
and
the
mutual
interchange
of
kind
feeling
and
good
offices
and
if
we
add
as
we
may
fairly
do
that
nothing
so
powerfully
attracts
and
draws
one
thing
to
itself
as
likeness
does
to
friendship
it
wilt
at
once
be
admitted
to
be
true
that
the
good
love
the
good
and
attach
them
to
themselves
as
though
they
were
united
by
blood
and
nature
for
nothing
can
be
more
eager
or
rather
greedy
for
what
is
like
itself
than
nature
so
my
dear
fannius
and
scaevola
we
may
look
upon
this
as
an
established
fact
that
between
good
men
there
is
as
it
were
of
necessity
a
kindly
feeling
which
is
the
source
of
friendship
ordained
by
nature
but
this
same
kindliness
affects
the
many
also
for
that
is
no
unsympathetic
or
selfish
or
exclusive
virtue
which
protects
even
whole
nations
and
consults
their
best
interests
and
that
certainly
it
would
not
have
done
had
it
disdained
all
affection
for
the
common
herd
again
the
believers
in
the
interest
theory
appear
to
me
to
destroy
the
most
attractive
link
in
the
chain
of
friendship
for
it
is
not
so
much
what
one
gets
by
a
friend
that
gives
one
pleasure
as
the
warmth
of
his
feeling
and
we
only
care
for
a
friend
service
if
it
has
been
prompted
by
affection
and
so
far
from
its
being
true
that
lack
of
means
is
a
motive
for
seeking
friendship
it
is
usually
those
who
being
most
richly
endowed
with
wealth
and
means
and
above
all
with
virtue
which
after
all
is
a
man
best
support
are
least
in
need
of
another
that
are
most
openhanded
and
beneficent
indeed
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
friends
ought
at
times
to
be
in
want
of
something
for
instance
what
scope
would
my
affections
have
had
if
scipio
had
never
wanted
my
advice
or
at
home
or
abroad
it
is
not
friendship
then
that
follows
material
advantage
but
material
advantage
friendship
we
must
not
therefore
listen
to
these
superfine
gentlemen
when
they
talk
of
friendship
which
they
know
neither
in
theory
nor
in
practice
for
who
in
heaven
name
would
choose
a
life
of
the
greatest
wealth
and
abundance
on
condition
of
neither
loving
or
being
beloved
by
any
creature
that
is
the
sort
of
life
tyrants
endure
they
of
course
can
count
on
no
fidelity
no
affection
no
security
for
the
goodwill
of
any
one
for
them
all
is
suspicion
and
anxiety
for
them
there
is
no
possibility
of
friendship
who
can
love
one
whom
he
fears
or
by
whom
he
knows
that
he
is
feared
yet
such
men
have
a
show
of
friendship
offered
them
but
it
is
only
a
show
if
it
ever
happen
that
they
fall
as
it
generally
does
they
will
at
once
understand
how
friendless
they
are
so
they
say
tarquin
observed
in
his
exile
that
he
never
knew
which
of
his
friends
were
real
and
which
sham
until
he
had
ceased
to
be
able
to
repay
either
though
what
surprises
me
is
that
a
man
of
his
proud
and
overbearing
character
should
have
a
friend
at
all
and
as
it
was
his
character
that
prevented
his
having
genuine
friends
so
it
often
happens
in
the
case
of
men
of
unusually
great
means
their
very
wealth
forbids
faithful
friendships
for
not
only
is
fortune
blind
herself
but
she
generally
makes
those
blind
also
who
enjoy
her
favours
they
are
carried
so
to
speak
beyond
themselves
with
and
nor
can
anything
be
more
perfectly
intolerable
than
a
successful
fool
you
may
often
see
it
men
who
before
had
pleasant
manners
enough
undergo
a
complete
change
on
attaining
power
of
office
they
despise
their
old
friends
devote
themselves
to
new
now
can
anything
be
more
foolish
than
that
men
who
have
all
the
opportunities
which
prosperity
wealth
and
great
means
can
bestow
should
secure
all
else
which
money
can
buy
horses
servants
splendid
upholstering
and
costly
plate
but
do
not
secure
friends
who
are
if
i
may
use
the
expression
the
most
valuable
and
beautiful
furniture
of
life
and
yet
when
they
acquire
the
former
they
know
not
who
will
enjoy
them
nor
for
whom
they
may
be
taking
all
this
trouble
for
they
will
one
and
all
eventually
belong
to
the
strongest
while
each
man
has
a
stable
and
inalienable
ownership
in
his
friendships
and
even
if
those
possessions
which
are
in
a
manner
the
gifts
of
fortune
do
prove
permanent
life
can
never
be
anything
but
joyless
which
is
without
the
consolations
and
companionship
of
friends
to
turn
to
another
branch
of
our
subject
we
must
now
endeavour
to
ascertain
what
limits
are
to
be
observed
in
friendship
what
is
the
so
to
speak
beyond
which
our
affection
is
not
to
go
on
this
point
i
notice
three
opinions
with
none
of
which
i
agree
one
is
we
should
love
our
friend
just
as
much
as
we
love
ourselves
and
no
more
another
that
our
affection
to
them
should
exactly
correspond
and
equal
theirs
to
us
a
third
that
a
man
should
be
valued
at
exactly
the
same
rate
as
he
values
to
not
one
of
these
opinions
do
i
assent
the
first
which
holds
that
our
regard
for
ourselves
is
to
be
the
measure
of
our
regard
for
our
friend
is
not
true
for
how
many
things
there
are
which
we
would
never
have
done
for
our
own
sakes
but
do
for
the
sake
of
a
friend
we
submit
to
make
requests
from
unworthy
people
to
descend
even
to
supplication
to
be
sharper
in
invective
more
violent
in
attack
such
actions
are
nut
creditable
in
our
own
interests
but
highly
so
in
those
of
our
friends
there
are
many
advantages
too
which
men
of
upright
character
voluntarily
forego
or
of
which
they
are
content
to
be
deprived
that
their
friends
may
enjoy
them
rather
than
themselves
the
second
doctrine
is
that
which
limits
friendship
to
an
exact
equality
in
mutual
good
offices
and
good
feelings
but
such
a
view
reduces
friendship
to
a
question
of
figures
in
a
spirit
far
too
narrow
and
illiberal
as
though
the
object
were
to
have
an
exact
balance
in
a
debtor
and
creditor
account
true
friendship
appears
to
me
to
be
something
richer
and
more
generous
than
that
comes
to
and
not
to
be
so
narrowly
on
its
guard
against
giving
more
than
it
receives
in
such
a
matter
we
must
not
be
always
afraid
of
something
being
wasted
or
running
over
in
our
measure
or
of
more
than
is
justly
due
being
devoted
to
our
friendship
but
the
last
limit
proposed
is
the
worst
namely
that
a
estimate
of
himself
is
to
be
the
measure
of
our
estimate
of
him
it
often
happens
that
a
man
has
too
humble
an
idea
of
himself
or
takes
too
despairing
a
view
of
his
chance
of
bettering
his
fortune
in
such
a
case
a
friend
ought
not
to
take
the
view
of
him
which
he
takes
of
himself
rather
he
should
do
all
he
can
to
raise
his
drooping
spirits
and
lead
him
to
more
cheerful
hopes
and
thoughts
we
must
then
find
some
other
limit
but
i
must
first
mention
the
sentiment
which
used
to
call
forth
scipio
severest
criticism
he
often
said
that
no
one
ever
gave
utterance
to
anything
more
diametrically
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
friendship
than
the
author
of
the
dictum
you
should
love
your
friend
with
the
consciousness
that
you
may
one
day
hate
him
he
could
not
be
induced
to
believe
that
it
was
rightfully
attributed
to
bias
who
was
counted
as
one
of
the
seven
sages
it
was
the
sentiment
of
some
person
with
sinister
motives
or
selfish
ambition
or
who
regarded
everything
as
it
affected
his
own
supremacy
how
can
a
man
be
friends
with
another
if
he
thinks
it
possible
that
he
may
be
his
enemy
why
it
will
follow
that
he
must
wish
and
desire
his
friend
to
commit
as
many
mistakes
as
possible
that
he
may
have
all
the
more
handles
against
him
and
conversely
that
he
must
be
annoyed
irritated
and
jealous
at
the
right
actions
or
good
fortune
of
his
friends
this
maxim
then
let
it
be
whose
it
will
is
the
utter
destruction
of
friendship
the
true
rule
is
to
take
such
care
in
the
selection
of
our
friends
as
never
to
enter
upon
a
friendship
with
a
man
whom
we
could
under
any
circumstances
come
to
hate
and
even
if
we
are
unlucky
in
our
choice
we
must
put
up
with
it
according
to
scipio
in
preference
to
making
calculations
as
to
a
future
breach
the
real
limit
to
be
observed
in
friendship
is
this
the
characters
of
two
friends
must
be
stainless
there
must
be
complete
harmony
of
interests
purpose
and
aims
without
exception
then
if
the
case
arises
of
a
friend
wish
not
strictly
right
in
itself
calling
for
support
in
a
matter
involving
his
life
or
reputation
we
must
make
some
concession
from
the
straight
path
on
condition
that
is
to
say
that
extreme
disgrace
is
not
the
consequence
something
must
be
conceded
to
friendship
and
yet
we
must
not
be
entirely
careless
of
our
reputation
nor
regard
the
good
opinion
of
our
as
a
weapon
which
we
can
afford
to
despise
in
conducting
the
business
of
our
life
however
lowering
it
may
be
to
tout
for
it
by
flattery
and
smooth
words
we
must
by
no
means
abjure
virtue
which
secures
us
affection
but
to
return
again
to
scipio
the
sole
author
of
the
discourse
on
friendship
he
used
to
complain
that
there
was
nothing
on
which
men
bestowed
so
little
pains
that
every
one
could
tell
exactly
how
many
goats
or
sheep
he
had
but
not
how
many
friends
and
while
they
took
pains
in
procuring
the
former
they
were
utterly
careless
in
selecting
friends
and
possessed
no
particular
marks
so
to
speak
or
tokens
by
which
they
might
judge
of
their
suitability
for
friendship
now
the
qualities
we
ought
to
look
out
for
in
making
our
selection
are
firmness
stability
constancy
there
is
a
plentiful
lack
of
men
so
endowed
and
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
judgment
without
testing
now
this
testing
can
only
be
made
during
the
actual
existence
of
the
for
friendship
so
often
precedes
the
formation
of
a
judgment
and
makes
a
previous
test
impossible
if
we
are
prudent
then
we
shall
rein
in
our
impulse
to
affection
as
we
do
chariot
horses
we
make
a
preliminary
trial
of
horses
so
we
should
of
friendship
and
should
test
our
friends
characters
by
a
kind
of
tentative
friendship
it
may
often
happen
that
the
untrustworthiness
of
certain
men
is
completely
displayed
in
a
small
money
matter
others
who
are
proof
against
a
small
sum
are
detected
if
it
be
large
but
even
if
some
are
found
who
think
it
mean
to
prefer
money
to
friendship
where
shall
we
look
for
those
who
put
friendship
before
office
civil
or
military
promotions
and
political
power
and
who
when
the
choice
lies
between
these
things
on
the
one
side
and
the
claims
of
friendship
on
the
other
do
not
give
a
strong
preference
to
the
former
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
be
indifferent
to
political
power
and
if
the
price
men
have
to
pay
for
it
is
the
sacrifice
of
friendship
they
think
their
treason
will
be
thrown
into
the
shade
by
the
magnitude
of
the
reward
this
is
why
true
friendship
is
very
difficult
to
find
among
those
who
engage
in
politics
and
the
contest
for
office
where
can
you
find
the
man
to
prefer
his
advancement
to
his
own
and
to
say
nothing
of
that
think
how
grievous
and
almost
intolerable
it
is
to
most
men
to
share
political
disaster
you
will
scarcely
find
anyone
who
can
bring
himself
to
do
that
and
though
what
ennius
says
is
quite
true
the
hour
of
need
shews
the
friend
indeed
yet
it
is
in
these
two
ways
that
most
people
betray
their
untrustworthiness
and
inconstancy
by
looking
down
on
friends
when
they
are
themselves
prosperous
or
deserting
them
in
their
distress
a
man
then
who
has
shewn
a
firm
unshaken
and
unvarying
friendship
in
both
these
contingencies
we
must
reckon
as
one
of
a
class
the
rarest
in
the
world
and
all
but
superhuman
now
what
is
the
quality
to
look
out
for
as
a
warrant
for
the
stability
and
permanence
of
friendship
it
is
loyalty
nothing
that
lacks
this
can
be
stable
we
should
also
in
making
our
selection
look
out
for
simplicity
a
social
disposition
and
a
sympathetic
nature
moved
by
what
moves
us
these
all
contribute
to
maintain
loyalty
you
can
never
trust
a
character
which
is
intricate
and
tortuous
nor
indeed
is
it
possible
for
one
to
be
trustworthy
and
firm
who
is
unsympathetic
by
nature
and
unmoved
by
what
affects
ourselves
we
may
add
that
he
must
neither
take
pleasure
in
bringing
accusations
against
us
himself
nor
believe
them
when
they
are
brought
all
these
contribute
to
form
that
constancy
which
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
describe
and
the
result
is
what
i
started
by
saying
that
friendship
is
only
possible
between
good
men
now
there
are
two
characteristic
features
in
his
treatment
of
his
friends
that
a
good
which
may
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
a
wise
man
will
always
display
first
he
will
be
entirely
without
any
or
pretence
of
feeling
for
the
open
display
even
of
dislike
is
more
becoming
to
an
ingenuous
character
than
a
studied
concealment
of
sentiment
secondly
he
will
not
only
reject
all
accusations
brought
against
his
friend
by
another
but
he
will
not
be
suspicious
himself
either
nor
be
always
thinking
that
his
friend
has
acted
improperly
besides
this
there
should
be
a
certain
pleasantness
in
word
and
manner
which
adds
no
little
flavour
to
friendship
a
gloomy
temper
and
unvarying
gravity
may
be
very
impressive
but
friendship
should
be
a
little
less
unbending
more
indulgent
and
gracious
and
more
inclined
to
all
kinds
of
and
but
here
arises
a
question
of
some
little
difficulty
are
there
any
occasions
on
which
assuming
their
worthiness
we
should
prefer
new
to
old
friends
just
as
we
prefer
young
to
aged
horses
the
answer
admits
of
no
doubt
whatever
for
there
should
be
no
satiety
in
friendship
as
there
is
in
other
things
the
older
the
sweeter
as
in
wines
that
keep
well
and
the
proverb
is
a
true
one
you
must
eat
many
a
peck
of
salt
with
a
man
to
be
thorough
friends
with
him
novelty
indeed
has
its
advantage
which
we
must
not
despise
there
is
always
hope
of
fruit
as
there
is
in
healthy
blades
of
corn
but
age
too
must
have
its
proper
position
and
in
fact
the
influence
of
time
and
habit
is
very
great
to
recur
to
the
illustration
of
the
horse
which
i
have
just
now
used
every
one
likes
to
use
the
horse
to
which
he
has
been
accustomed
rather
than
one
that
is
untried
and
new
and
it
is
not
only
in
the
case
of
a
living
thing
that
this
rule
holds
good
but
in
inanimate
things
also
for
we
like
places
where
we
have
lived
the
longest
even
though
they
are
mountainous
and
covered
with
forest
but
here
is
another
golden
rule
in
friendship
yourself
on
a
level
with
your
for
it
often
happens
that
there
are
certain
superiorities
as
for
example
scipio
in
what
i
may
call
our
set
now
he
never
assumed
any
airs
of
superiority
over
philus
or
rupilius
or
mummius
or
over
friends
of
a
lower
rank
stilt
for
instance
he
always
shewed
a
deference
to
his
brother
quintus
maximus
because
he
was
his
senior
who
though
a
man
no
doubt
of
eminent
character
was
by
no
means
his
equal
he
used
also
to
wish
that
all
his
friends
should
be
the
better
for
his
support
this
is
an
example
we
should
all
follow
if
any
of
us
have
any
advantage
in
personal
character
intellect
or
fortune
we
should
be
ready
to
make
our
friends
sharers
and
partners
in
it
with
ourselves
for
instance
if
their
parents
are
in
humble
circumstances
if
their
relations
are
powerful
neither
in
intellect
nor
means
we
should
supply
their
deficiencies
and
promote
their
rank
and
dignity
you
know
the
legends
of
children
brought
up
as
servants
in
ignorance
of
their
parentage
and
family
when
they
are
recognized
and
discovered
to
be
the
sons
of
gods
or
kings
they
still
retain
their
affection
for
the
shepherds
whom
they
have
for
many
years
looked
upon
as
their
parents
much
more
ought
this
to
be
so
in
the
case
of
real
and
undoubted
parents
for
the
advantages
of
genius
and
virtue
and
in
short
of
every
kind
of
superiority
are
never
realized
to
their
fullest
extent
until
they
are
bestowed
upon
our
nearest
and
dearest
but
the
converse
must
also
be
observed
for
in
friendship
and
relationship
just
as
those
who
possess
any
superiority
must
put
themselves
on
an
equal
footing
with
those
who
are
less
fortunate
so
these
latter
must
not
be
annoyed
at
being
surpassed
in
genius
fortune
or
rank
but
most
people
of
that
sort
are
forever
either
grumbling
at
something
or
harping
on
their
claims
and
especially
if
they
consider
that
they
have
services
of
their
own
to
allege
involving
zeal
and
friendship
and
some
trouble
to
themselves
people
who
are
always
bringing
up
their
services
are
a
nuisance
the
recipient
ought
to
remember
them
the
performer
should
never
mention
them
in
the
case
of
friends
then
as
the
superior
are
bound
to
descend
so
are
they
bound
in
a
certain
sense
to
raise
those
below
them
for
there
are
people
who
make
their
friendship
disagreeable
by
imagining
themselves
undervalued
this
generally
happens
only
to
those
who
think
that
they
deserve
to
be
so
and
they
ought
to
be
shewn
by
deeds
as
well
as
by
words
the
groundlessness
of
their
opinion
now
the
measure
of
your
benefits
should
be
in
the
first
place
your
own
power
to
bestow
and
in
the
second
place
the
capacity
to
bear
them
on
the
part
of
him
on
whom
you
are
bestowing
affection
and
help
for
however
great
your
personal
prestige
may
be
you
can
not
raise
all
your
friends
to
the
highest
offices
of
the
state
for
instance
scipio
was
able
to
make
publius
rupilius
consul
but
not
his
brother
lucius
but
granting
that
you
can
give
anyone
anything
you
choose
you
must
have
a
care
that
it
does
not
prove
to
be
beyond
his
powers
as
a
general
rule
we
must
wait
to
make
up
our
mind
about
friendships
till
men
characters
and
years
have
arrived
at
their
full
strength
and
development
people
must
not
for
instance
regard
as
fast
friends
all
whom
in
their
youthful
enthusiasm
for
hunting
or
football
they
liked
for
having
the
same
tastes
by
that
rule
if
it
were
a
mere
question
of
time
no
one
would
have
such
claims
on
our
affections
as
nurses
and
not
that
they
are
to
be
neglected
but
they
stand
on
a
different
ground
it
is
only
these
mature
friendships
that
can
be
permanent
for
difference
of
character
leads
to
difference
of
aims
and
the
result
of
such
diversity
is
to
estrange
friends
the
sole
reason
for
instance
which
prevents
good
men
from
making
friends
with
bad
or
bad
with
good
is
that
the
divergence
of
their
characters
and
aims
is
the
greatest
possible
another
good
rule
in
friendship
is
this
do
not
let
an
excessive
affection
hinder
the
highest
interests
of
your
friends
this
very
often
happens
i
will
go
again
to
the
region
of
fable
for
an
instance
neoptolemus
could
never
have
taken
troy
if
he
had
been
willing
to
listen
to
lycomedes
who
had
brought
him
up
and
with
many
tears
tried
to
prevent
his
going
there
again
it
often
happens
that
important
business
makes
it
necessary
to
part
from
friends
the
man
who
tries
to
baulk
it
because
he
thinks
that
he
can
not
endure
the
separation
is
of
a
weak
and
effeminate
nature
and
on
that
very
account
makes
but
a
poor
friend
there
are
of
course
limits
to
what
you
ought
to
expect
from
a
friend
and
to
what
you
should
allow
him
to
demand
of
you
and
these
you
must
take
into
calculation
in
every
case
again
there
is
such
a
disaster
so
to
speak
as
having
to
break
off
friendship
and
sometimes
it
is
one
we
can
not
avoid
for
at
this
point
the
stream
of
our
discourse
is
leaving
the
intimacies
of
the
wise
and
touching
on
the
friendship
of
ordinary
people
it
will
happen
at
times
that
an
outbreak
of
vicious
conduct
affects
either
a
man
friends
themselves
or
strangers
yet
the
discredit
falls
on
the
friends
in
such
cases
friendships
should
be
allowed
to
die
out
gradually
by
an
intermission
of
intercourse
they
should
as
i
have
been
told
that
cato
used
to
say
rather
be
unstitched
than
toni
in
twain
unless
indeed
the
injurious
conduct
be
of
so
violent
and
outrageous
a
nature
as
to
make
an
instant
breach
and
separation
the
only
possible
course
consistent
with
honour
and
rectitude
again
if
a
change
in
character
and
aim
takes
place
as
often
happens
or
if
party
politics
produces
an
alienation
of
feeling
i
am
now
speaking
as
i
said
a
short
time
ago
of
ordinary
friendships
not
of
those
of
the
wise
we
shall
have
to
be
on
our
guard
against
appearing
to
embark
upon
active
enmity
while
we
only
mean
to
resign
a
friendship
for
there
can
be
nothing
more
discreditable
than
to
be
at
open
war
with
a
man
with
whom
you
have
been
intimate
scipio
as
you
are
aware
had
abandoned
his
friendship
for
quintus
pompeius
on
my
account
and
again
from
differences
of
opinion
in
politics
he
became
estranged
from
my
colleague
metellus
in
both
cases
he
acted
with
dignity
and
moderation
shewing
that
he
was
offended
indeed
but
without
tancour
our
first
object
then
should
be
to
prevent
a
breach
our
second
to
secure
that
if
it
does
occur
our
friendship
should
seem
to
have
died
a
natural
rather
than
a
violent
death
next
we
should
take
care
that
friendship
is
not
converted
into
active
hostility
from
which
flow
personal
quarrels
abusive
language
and
angry
recriminations
these
last
however
provided
that
they
do
not
pass
all
reasonable
limits
of
forbearance
we
ought
to
put
up
with
and
in
compliment
to
an
old
friendship
allow
the
party
that
inflicts
the
injury
not
the
one
that
submits
to
it
to
be
in
the
wrong
generally
speaking
there
is
but
one
way
of
securing
and
providing
oneself
against
faults
and
inconveniences
of
this
sort
not
to
be
too
hasty
in
bestowing
our
affection
and
not
to
bestow
it
at
all
on
unworthy
objects
now
by
worthy
of
friendship
i
mean
those
who
have
in
themselves
the
qualities
which
attract
affection
this
sort
of
man
is
rare
and
indeed
all
excellent
things
are
rare
and
nothing
in
the
world
is
so
hard
to
find
as
a
thing
entirely
and
completely
perfect
of
its
kind
but
most
people
not
only
recognize
nothing
as
good
in
our
life
unless
it
is
profitable
but
look
upon
friends
as
so
much
stock
caring
most
for
those
by
whom
they
hope
to
make
most
profit
accordingly
they
never
possess
that
most
beautiful
and
most
spontaneous
friendship
which
must
be
sought
solely
for
itself
without
any
ulterior
object
they
fail
also
to
learn
from
their
own
feelings
the
nature
and
the
strength
of
friendship
for
every
one
loves
himself
not
for
any
reward
which
such
love
may
bring
but
because
he
is
dear
to
himself
independently
of
anything
else
but
unless
this
feeling
is
transferred
to
another
what
a
real
friend
is
will
never
be
revealed
for
he
is
as
it
were
a
second
self
but
if
we
find
these
two
instincts
shewing
themselves
in
animals
whether
of
the
air
or
the
sea
or
the
land
whether
wild
or
tame
first
a
love
of
self
which
in
fact
is
born
in
everything
that
lives
alike
and
secondly
an
eagerness
to
find
and
attach
themselves
to
other
creatures
of
their
own
kind
and
if
this
natural
action
is
accompanied
by
desire
and
by
something
resembling
human
love
how
much
more
must
this
be
the
case
in
man
by
the
law
of
his
nature
for
man
not
only
loves
himself
but
seeks
another
whose
spirit
he
may
so
blend
with
his
own
as
almost
to
make
one
being
of
two
but
most
people
unreasonably
not
to
speak
of
modesty
want
such
a
friend
as
they
are
unable
to
be
themselves
and
expect
from
their
friends
what
they
do
not
themselves
give
the
fair
course
is
first
to
be
good
yourself
and
then
to
look
out
for
another
of
like
character
it
is
between
such
that
the
stability
in
friendship
of
which
we
have
been
talking
can
be
secured
when
that
is
to
say
men
who
are
united
by
affection
learn
first
of
all
to
rule
those
passions
which
enslave
others
and
in
the
next
place
to
take
delight
in
fair
and
equitable
conduct
to
bear
each
other
burdens
never
to
ask
each
other
for
anything
inconsistent
with
virtue
and
rectitude
and
not
only
to
serve
and
love
but
also
to
respect
each
other
i
say
respect
for
if
respect
is
gone
friendship
has
lost
its
brightest
jewel
and
this
shows
the
mistake
of
those
who
imagine
that
friendship
gives
a
privilege
to
licentiousness
and
sin
nature
has
given
us
friendship
as
the
handmaid
of
virtue
not
as
a
partner
in
guilt
to
the
end
that
virtue
being
powerless
when
isolated
to
reach
the
highest
objects
might
succeed
in
doing
so
in
union
and
partnership
with
another
those
who
enjoy
in
the
present
or
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
or
are
destined
to
enjoy
in
the
future
such
a
partnership
as
this
must
be
considered
to
have
secured
the
most
excellent
and
auspicious
combination
for
reaching
highest
good
this
is
the
partnership
i
say
which
combines
moral
rectitude
fame
peace
of
mind
serenity
all
that
men
think
desirable
because
with
them
life
is
happy
but
without
them
can
not
be
so
this
being
our
best
and
highest
object
we
must
if
we
desire
to
attain
it
devote
ourselves
to
virtue
for
without
virtue
we
can
obtain
neither
friendship
nor
anything
else
desirable
in
fact
if
virtue
be
neglected
those
who
imagine
themselves
to
possess
friends
will
find
out
their
error
as
soon
as
some
grave
disaster
forces
them
to
make
trial
of
them
wherefore
i
must
again
and
again
repeat
you
must
satisfy
your
judgment
before
engaging
your
affections
not
love
first
and
judge
afterwards
we
suffer
from
carelessness
in
many
of
our
undertakings
in
none
more
than
in
selecting
and
cultivating
our
friends
we
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
shut
the
stable
door
when
the
steed
is
stolen
in
defiance
of
the
old
proverb
for
having
mutually
involved
ourselves
in
a
intimacy
or
by
actual
obligations
all
on
a
sudden
some
cause
of
offence
arises
and
we
break
off
our
friendships
in
full
career
it
is
this
that
makes
such
carelessness
in
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
all
the
more
worthy
of
blame
i
say
supreme
importance
because
friendship
is
the
one
thing
about
the
utility
of
which
everybody
with
one
accord
is
agreed
that
is
not
the
case
in
regard
even
to
virtue
itself
for
many
people
speak
slightingly
of
virtue
as
though
it
were
mere
puffing
and
nor
is
it
the
case
with
riches
many
look
down
on
riches
being
content
with
a
little
and
taking
pleasure
in
poor
fare
and
dress
and
as
to
the
political
offices
for
which
some
have
a
burning
desire
how
many
entertain
such
a
contempt
for
them
as
to
think
nothing
in
the
world
more
empty
and
trivial
and
so
on
with
the
rest
things
desirable
in
the
eyes
of
some
are
regarded
by
very
many
as
worthless
but
of
friendship
all
think
alike
to
a
man
whether
those
have
devoted
themselves
to
politics
or
those
who
delight
in
science
and
philosophy
or
those
who
follow
a
private
way
of
life
and
care
for
nothing
but
their
own
business
or
those
lastly
who
have
given
themselves
body
and
soul
to
sensuality
they
all
think
i
say
that
without
friendship
life
is
no
life
if
they
want
some
part
of
it
at
any
rate
to
be
noble
for
friendship
in
one
way
or
another
penetrates
into
the
lives
of
us
all
and
suffers
no
career
to
be
entirely
free
from
its
influence
though
a
man
be
of
so
churlish
and
unsociable
a
nature
as
to
loathe
and
shun
the
company
of
mankind
as
we
are
told
was
the
case
with
a
certain
timon
at
athens
yet
even
he
can
not
refrain
from
seeking
some
one
in
whose
hearing
he
may
disgorge
the
venom
of
his
bitter
temper
we
should
see
this
most
clearly
if
it
were
possible
that
some
god
should
carry
us
away
from
these
haunts
of
men
and
place
us
somewhere
in
perfect
solitude
and
then
should
supply
us
in
abundance
with
everything
necessary
to
our
nature
and
yet
take
from
us
entirely
the
opportunity
of
looking
upon
a
human
being
who
could
steel
himself
to
endure
such
a
life
who
would
not
lose
in
his
loneliness
the
zest
for
all
pleasures
and
indeed
this
is
the
point
of
the
observation
of
i
think
archytas
of
tarentum
i
have
it
third
hand
men
who
were
my
seniors
told
me
that
their
seniors
had
told
them
it
was
this
if
a
man
could
ascend
to
heaven
and
get
a
clear
view
of
the
natural
order
of
the
universe
and
the
beauty
of
the
heavenly
bodies
that
wonderful
spectacle
would
give
him
small
pleasure
though
nothing
could
be
conceived
more
delightful
if
he
had
but
had
some
one
to
whom
to
tell
what
he
had
seen
so
true
it
is
that
nature
abhors
isolation
and
ever
leans
upon
something
as
a
stay
and
support
and
this
is
found
in
its
most
pleasing
form
in
our
closest
friend
but
though
nature
also
declares
by
so
many
indications
what
her
wish
and
object
and
desire
is
we
yet
in
a
manner
turn
a
deaf
ear
and
will
not
hear
her
warnings
the
intercourse
between
friends
is
varied
and
complex
and
it
must
often
happen
that
causes
of
suspicion
and
offence
arise
which
a
wise
man
will
sometimes
avoid
at
other
times
remove
at
others
treat
with
indulgence
the
one
possible
cause
of
offence
that
must
be
faced
is
when
the
interests
of
your
friend
and
your
own
sincerity
are
at
stake
for
instance
it
often
happens
that
friends
need
remonstrance
and
even
reproof
when
these
are
administered
in
a
kindly
spirit
they
ought
to
be
taken
in
good
part
but
somehow
or
other
there
is
truth
in
what
my
friend
terence
says
in
his
compliance
gets
us
friends
plain
speaking
hate
plain
speaking
is
a
cause
of
trouble
if
the
result
of
it
is
resentment
which
is
poison
of
friendship
but
compliance
is
really
the
cause
of
much
more
trouble
because
by
indulging
his
faults
it
lets
a
friend
plunge
into
headlong
ruin
but
the
man
who
is
most
to
blame
is
he
who
resents
plain
speaking
and
allows
flattery
to
egg
him
on
to
his
ruin
on
this
point
then
from
first
to
last
there
is
need
of
deliberation
and
care
if
we
remonstrate
it
should
be
without
bitterness
if
we
reprove
there
should
be
no
word
of
insult
in
the
matter
of
compliance
for
i
am
glad
to
adopt
terence
word
though
there
should
be
every
courtesy
yet
that
base
kind
which
assists
a
man
in
vice
should
be
far
from
us
for
it
is
unworthy
of
a
man
to
say
nothing
of
a
friend
it
is
one
thing
to
live
with
a
tyrant
another
with
a
friend
but
if
a
ears
are
so
closed
to
plain
speaking
that
he
can
not
hear
to
hear
the
truth
from
a
friend
we
may
give
him
up
in
despair
this
remark
of
cato
as
so
many
of
his
did
shews
great
acuteness
there
are
people
who
owe
more
to
bitter
enemies
than
to
apparently
pleasant
friends
the
former
often
speak
the
truth
the
latter
never
besides
it
is
a
strange
paradox
that
the
recipients
of
advice
should
feel
no
annoyance
where
they
ought
to
feel
it
and
yet
feel
so
much
where
they
ought
not
they
are
not
at
all
vexed
at
having
committed
a
fault
but
very
angry
at
being
reproved
for
it
on
the
contrary
they
ought
to
be
grieved
at
the
crime
and
glad
of
the
correction
well
then
if
it
is
true
that
to
give
and
receive
advice
the
former
with
freedom
and
yet
without
bitterness
the
latter
with
patience
and
without
irritation
is
peculiarly
appropriate
to
genuine
friendship
it
is
no
less
true
that
there
can
be
nothing
more
utterly
subversive
of
friendship
than
flattery
adulation
and
base
compliance
i
use
as
many
terms
as
possible
to
brand
this
vice
of
untrustworthy
men
whose
sole
object
in
speaking
is
to
please
without
any
regard
to
truth
in
everything
false
pretence
is
bad
for
it
suspends
and
vitiates
our
power
of
discerning
the
truth
but
to
nothing
it
is
so
hostile
as
to
friendship
for
it
destroys
that
frankness
without
which
friendship
is
an
empty
name
for
the
essence
of
friendship
being
that
two
minds
become
as
one
how
can
that
ever
take
place
if
the
mind
of
each
of
the
separate
parties
to
it
is
not
single
and
uniform
but
variable
changeable
and
complex
can
anything
be
so
pliable
so
wavering
as
the
mind
of
a
man
whose
attitude
depends
not
only
on
another
feeling
and
wish
but
on
his
very
looks
and
nods
if
one
says
no
i
answer
no
if
yes
i
answer
yes
in
fine
i
laid
this
task
upon
myself
to
echo
all
that
said
to
quote
my
old
friend
terence
again
but
he
puts
these
words
into
the
mouth
of
a
gnatho
to
admit
such
a
man
into
one
intimacy
at
all
is
a
sign
of
folly
but
there
are
many
people
like
gnatho
and
it
is
when
they
are
superior
either
in
position
or
fortune
or
reputation
that
their
flatteries
become
mischievous
the
weight
of
their
position
making
up
for
the
lightness
of
their
character
but
if
we
only
take
reasonable
care
it
is
as
easy
to
separate
and
distinguish
a
genuine
from
a
specious
friend
as
anything
else
that
is
coloured
and
artificial
from
what
is
sincere
and
genuine
a
public
assembly
though
composed
of
men
of
the
smallest
possible
culture
nevertheless
will
see
clearly
the
difference
between
a
mere
demagogue
that
is
a
flatterer
and
untrustworthy
citizen
and
a
man
of
principle
standing
and
solidity
it
was
by
this
kind
of
flattering
language
that
gaius
papirius
the
other
day
endeavoured
to
tickle
the
ears
of
the
assembled
people
when
proposing
his
law
to
make
the
tribunes
i
spoke
against
it
but
i
will
leave
the
personal
question
i
prefer
speaking
of
scipio
good
heavens
how
impressive
his
speech
was
what
a
majesty
there
was
in
it
you
would
have
pronounced
him
without
hesitation
to
be
no
mere
henchman
of
the
roman
people
but
their
leader
however
you
were
there
and
moreover
have
the
speech
in
your
hands
the
result
was
that
a
law
meant
to
please
the
people
was
by
the
people
votes
rejected
once
more
to
refer
to
myself
you
remember
how
apparently
popular
was
the
law
proposed
by
gaius
licinius
crassus
about
the
election
to
the
college
of
priests
in
the
consulship
of
quintus
maximus
scipio
brother
and
lucius
mancinus
for
the
power
of
filling
up
their
own
vacancies
on
the
part
of
the
colleges
was
by
this
proposal
to
be
transferred
to
the
people
it
was
this
man
by
the
way
who
began
the
practice
of
turning
towards
the
forum
when
addressing
the
people
in
spite
of
this
however
upon
my
speaking
on
the
conservative
side
religion
gained
an
easy
victory
over
his
plausible
speech
this
took
place
in
my
praetorship
five
years
before
i
was
elected
consul
which
shows
that
the
cause
was
successfully
maintained
more
by
the
merits
of
the
case
than
by
the
prestige
of
the
highest
office
now
if
on
a
stage
such
as
a
public
assembly
essentially
is
where
there
is
the
amplest
room
for
fiction
and
truth
nevertheless
prevails
if
it
be
but
fairly
laid
open
and
brought
into
the
light
of
day
what
ought
to
happen
in
the
case
of
friendship
which
rests
entirely
on
truthfulness
friendship
in
which
unless
you
both
see
and
show
an
open
breast
to
use
a
common
expression
you
can
neither
trust
nor
be
certain
of
anything
no
not
even
of
mutual
affection
since
you
can
not
be
sure
of
its
sincerity
however
this
flattery
injurious
as
it
is
can
hurt
no
one
but
the
man
who
takes
it
in
and
likes
it
and
it
follows
that
the
man
to
open
his
ears
widest
to
flatterers
is
he
who
first
flatters
himself
and
is
fondest
of
himself
i
grant
you
that
virtue
naturally
loves
herself
for
she
knows
herself
and
perceives
how
worthy
of
love
she
is
but
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
absolute
virtue
but
of
the
belief
men
have
that
they
possess
virtue
the
fact
is
that
fewer
people
are
endowed
with
virtue
than
wish
to
be
thought
to
be
so
it
is
such
people
that
take
delight
in
flattery
when
they
are
addressed
in
language
expressly
adapted
to
flatter
their
vanity
they
look
upon
such
empty
persiflage
as
a
testimony
to
the
truth
of
their
own
praises
it
is
not
then
properly
friendship
at
all
when
the
one
will
not
listen
to
the
truth
and
the
other
is
prepared
to
lie
nor
would
the
servility
of
parasites
in
comedy
have
seemed
humorous
to
us
had
there
been
no
such
things
as
braggart
captains
is
thais
really
much
obliged
to
me
it
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
answer
much
but
he
must
needs
say
immensely
your
servile
flatterer
always
exaggerates
what
his
victim
wishes
to
be
put
strongly
wherefore
though
it
is
with
those
who
catch
at
and
invite
it
that
this
flattering
falsehood
is
especially
powerful
yet
men
even
of
soldier
and
steadier
character
must
be
warned
to
be
on
the
watch
against
being
taken
in
by
cunningly
disguised
flattery
an
open
flatterer
any
one
can
detect
unless
he
is
an
absolute
fool
the
covert
insinuation
of
the
cunning
and
the
sly
is
what
we
have
to
be
studiously
on
our
guard
against
his
detection
is
not
by
any
means
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
he
often
covers
his
servility
under
the
guise
of
contradiction
and
flatters
by
pretending
to
dispute
and
then
at
last
giving
in
and
allowing
himself
to
be
beaten
that
the
person
hoodwinked
may
think
himself
to
have
been
the
now
what
can
be
more
degrading
than
to
be
thus
hoodwinked
you
must
be
on
your
guard
against
this
happening
to
you
like
the
man
in
the
how
have
i
been
befooled
no
drivelling
dotards
on
any
stage
were
so
upon
for
even
on
the
stage
we
have
no
grosser
representation
of
folly
than
that
of
and
credulous
old
men
but
somehow
or
other
i
have
strayed
away
from
the
friendship
of
the
perfect
that
is
of
the
wise
meaning
of
course
such
wisdom
as
human
nature
is
capable
of
to
the
subject
of
vulgar
unsubstantial
friendships
let
us
then
return
to
our
original
theme
and
at
length
bring
that
too
to
a
conclusion
well
then
fannius
and
mucius
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
it
is
virtue
virtue
which
both
creates
and
preserves
friendship
on
it
depends
harmony
of
interest
permanence
fidelity
when
virtue
has
reared
her
head
and
shewn
the
light
of
her
countenance
and
seen
and
recognised
the
same
light
in
another
she
gravitates
towards
it
and
in
her
turn
welcomes
that
which
the
other
has
to
shew
and
from
it
springs
up
a
flame
which
you
may
call
love
or
friendship
as
you
please
both
words
are
from
the
same
root
in
latin
and
love
is
just
the
cleaving
to
him
whom
you
love
without
the
prompting
of
need
or
any
view
to
advantage
though
this
latter
blossoms
spontaneously
on
friendship
little
as
you
may
have
looked
for
it
it
is
with
such
warmth
of
feeling
that
i
cherished
lucius
paulus
marcus
cato
galus
gallus
publius
nasica
tiberius
gracchus
my
dear
scipio
it
shines
with
even
greater
warmth
when
men
are
of
the
same
age
as
in
the
case
of
scipio
and
lucius
furius
publius
rupilius
spurius
mummius
and
myself
in
my
old
age
i
find
comfort
in
the
affection
of
young
men
as
in
the
case
of
yourselves
and
quintus
tubero
nay
more
i
delight
in
the
intimacy
of
such
a
very
young
man
as
publius
rutilius
and
aulus
verginius
and
since
the
law
of
our
nature
and
of
our
life
is
that
a
new
generation
is
for
ever
springing
up
the
most
desirable
thing
is
that
along
with
your
contemporaries
with
whom
you
started
in
the
race
you
may
also
teach
what
is
to
us
the
goal
but
in
view
of
the
instability
and
perishableness
of
mortal
things
we
should
be
continually
on
the
for
some
to
love
and
by
whom
to
be
loved
for
if
we
lose
affection
and
kindliness
from
our
life
we
lose
all
that
gives
it
charm
for
me
indeed
though
torn
away
by
a
sudden
stroke
scipio
still
lives
and
ever
wilt
live
for
it
was
the
virtue
of
the
man
that
i
loved
and
that
has
not
suffered
death
and
it
is
not
my
eyes
only
because
i
had
all
my
life
a
personal
experience
of
it
that
never
lose
sight
of
it
it
will
shine
to
posterity
also
with
undimmed
glory
no
one
will
ever
cherish
a
nobler
ambition
or
a
loftier
hope
without
thinking
his
memory
and
his
image
the
best
to
put
before
his
eyes
i
declare
that
of
all
the
blessings
which
either
fortune
or
nature
has
bestowed
upon
me
i
know
none
to
compare
with
scipio
friendship
in
it
i
found
sympathy
in
public
counsel
in
private
business
in
it
too
a
means
of
spending
my
leisure
with
unalloyed
delight
never
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
did
i
offend
him
even
in
the
most
trivial
point
never
did
i
hear
a
word
from
him
i
could
have
wished
unsaid
we
had
one
house
one
table
one
style
of
living
and
not
only
were
we
together
on
foreign
service
but
in
our
tours
also
and
country
sojourns
why
speak
of
our
eagerness
to
be
ever
gaining
some
knowledge
to
be
ever
learning
something
on
which
we
spent
all
our
leisure
hours
far
from
the
gaze
of
the
world
if
the
recollection
and
memory
of
these
things
had
perished
with
the
man
i
could
not
possibly
have
endured
the
regret
for
one
so
closely
united
with
me
in
life
and
affection
but
these
things
have
not
perished
they
are
rather
fed
and
strengthened
by
reflexion
and
memory
even
supposing
me
to
have
been
entirely
bereft
of
them
still
my
time
of
life
of
itself
brings
me
no
small
consolation
for
i
can
not
have
much
longer
now
to
bear
this
regret
and
everything
that
is
brief
ought
to
be
endurable
however
severe
this
is
all
i
had
to
say
on
friendship
one
piece
of
advice
on
parting
make
up
your
minds
to
this
virtue
without
which
friendship
is
impossible
is
first
but
next
to
it
and
to
it
alone
the
greatest
of
all
things
is
friendship
on
old
age
and
should
my
service
titus
ease
the
weight
of
care
that
wrings
your
heart
and
draw
the
sting
which
rankles
there
what
guerdon
shall
there
he
for
i
may
address
you
atticus
in
the
lines
in
which
flamininus
was
addressed
by
the
man
who
poor
in
wealth
was
rich
in
honour
gold
though
i
am
well
assured
that
you
are
not
as
flamininus
was
kept
on
the
rack
of
care
by
night
and
day
for
i
know
how
well
ordered
and
equable
your
mind
is
and
am
fully
aware
that
it
was
not
a
surname
alone
which
you
brought
home
with
you
from
athens
but
its
culture
and
good
sense
and
yet
i
have
an
idea
that
you
are
at
times
stirred
to
the
heart
by
the
same
circumstances
as
myself
to
console
you
for
these
is
a
more
serious
matter
and
must
be
put
off
to
another
time
for
the
present
i
have
resolved
to
dedicate
to
you
an
essay
on
old
age
for
from
the
burden
of
impending
or
at
least
advancing
age
common
to
us
both
i
would
do
something
to
relieve
us
both
though
as
to
yourself
i
am
fully
aware
that
you
support
and
will
support
it
as
you
do
everything
else
with
calmness
and
philosophy
but
directly
i
resolved
to
write
on
old
age
you
at
once
occurred
to
me
as
deserving
a
gift
of
which
both
of
us
might
take
advantage
to
myself
indeed
the
composition
of
this
book
has
been
so
delightful
that
it
has
not
only
wiped
away
all
the
disagreeables
of
old
age
but
has
even
made
it
luxurious
and
delightful
too
never
therefore
can
philosophy
be
praised
as
highly
as
it
deserves
considering
that
its
faithful
disciple
is
able
to
spend
every
period
of
his
life
with
unruffled
feelings
however
on
other
subjects
i
have
spoken
at
large
and
shall
often
speak
again
this
hook
which
i
herewith
send
you
is
on
old
age
i
have
put
the
whole
discourse
not
as
alisto
of
cos
did
in
the
mouth
of
tithonus
for
a
mere
fable
would
have
lacked
conviction
but
in
that
of
marcus
cato
when
he
was
an
old
man
to
give
my
essay
greater
weight
i
represent
laelius
and
scipio
at
his
house
expressing
surprise
at
his
carrying
his
years
so
lightly
and
cato
answering
them
if
he
shall
seem
to
shew
somewhat
more
learning
in
this
discourse
than
he
generally
did
in
his
own
books
put
it
down
to
the
greek
literature
of
which
it
is
known
that
he
became
an
eager
student
in
his
old
age
but
what
need
of
more
own
words
will
at
once
explain
all
i
feel
about
old
age
cato
publius
cornelius
scipio
africanus
the
younger
gaius
laelius
many
a
time
have
i
in
conversation
with
my
friend
gaius
laelius
here
expressed
my
admiration
marcus
cato
of
the
eminent
nay
perfect
wisdom
displayed
by
you
indeed
at
all
points
but
above
everything
because
i
have
noticed
that
old
age
never
seemed
a
burden
to
you
while
to
most
old
men
it
is
so
hateful
that
they
declare
themselves
under
a
weight
heavier
than
aetna
your
admiration
is
easily
excited
it
seems
my
dear
scipio
and
laelius
men
of
course
who
have
no
resources
in
themselves
for
securing
a
good
and
happy
life
find
every
age
burdensome
but
those
who
look
for
all
happiness
from
within
can
never
think
anything
had
which
nature
makes
inevitable
in
that
category
before
anything
else
comes
old
age
to
which
all
wish
to
attain
and
at
which
all
grumble
when
attained
such
is
folly
inconsistency
and
unreasonableness
they
say
that
it
is
stealing
upon
them
faster
than
they
expected
in
the
first
place
who
compelled
them
to
hug
an
illusion
for
in
what
respect
did
old
age
steal
upon
manhood
faster
than
manhood
upon
childhood
in
the
next
place
in
what
way
would
old
age
have
been
less
disagreeable
to
them
if
they
were
in
their
year
than
in
their
eightieth
for
their
past
however
long
when
once
it
was
past
would
have
no
consolation
for
a
stupid
old
age
wherefore
if
it
is
your
wont
to
admire
my
wisdom
and
i
would
that
it
were
worthy
of
your
good
opinion
and
of
my
own
surname
of
sapiens
it
really
consists
in
the
fact
that
i
follow
nature
the
best
of
guides
as
i
would
a
god
and
am
loyal
to
her
commands
it
is
not
likely
if
she
has
written
the
rest
of
the
play
well
that
she
has
been
careless
about
the
last
act
like
some
idle
poet
but
after
all
some
last
was
inevitable
just
as
to
the
berries
of
a
tree
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
there
comes
in
the
fulness
of
time
a
period
of
decay
and
fall
a
wise
man
will
not
make
a
grievance
of
this
to
rebel
against
nature
is
not
that
to
fight
like
the
giants
with
the
gods
and
yet
cato
you
will
do
us
a
very
great
favour
i
venture
to
speak
for
scipio
as
for
myself
if
since
we
all
hope
or
at
least
wish
to
become
old
men
you
would
allow
us
to
learn
from
you
in
good
time
before
it
arrives
by
what
methods
we
may
most
easily
acquire
the
strength
to
support
the
burden
of
advancing
age
i
will
do
so
without
doubt
laelius
especially
if
as
you
say
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
both
we
do
wish
very
much
cato
if
it
is
no
trouble
to
you
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
nature
of
the
bourne
which
you
have
reached
after
completing
a
long
journey
as
it
were
upon
which
we
too
are
bound
to
embark
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
laelius
it
has
often
been
my
fortune
to
bear
the
complaints
of
my
contemporaries
like
will
to
like
you
know
according
to
the
old
proverb
complaints
to
which
men
like
salinator
and
sp
albinus
who
were
of
consular
rank
and
about
my
time
used
to
give
vent
they
were
first
that
they
had
lost
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
without
which
they
did
not
regard
life
as
life
at
all
and
secondly
that
they
were
neglected
by
those
from
whom
they
had
been
used
to
receive
attentions
such
men
appear
to
me
to
lay
the
blame
on
the
wrong
thing
for
if
it
had
been
the
fault
of
old
age
then
these
same
misfortunes
would
have
befallen
me
and
all
other
men
of
advanced
years
but
i
have
known
many
of
them
who
never
said
a
word
of
complaint
against
old
age
for
they
were
only
too
glad
to
be
freed
from
the
bondage
of
passion
and
were
not
at
all
looked
down
upon
by
their
friends
the
fact
is
that
the
blame
for
all
complaints
of
that
kind
is
to
be
charged
to
character
not
to
a
particular
time
of
life
for
old
men
who
are
reasonable
and
neither
nor
churlish
find
old
age
tolerable
enough
whereas
unreason
and
churlishness
cause
uneasiness
at
every
time
of
life
it
is
as
you
say
cato
but
perhaps
some
one
may
suggest
that
it
is
your
large
means
wealth
and
high
position
that
make
you
think
old
age
tolerable
whereas
such
good
fortune
only
falls
to
few
there
is
something
in
that
laelius
but
by
no
means
all
for
instance
the
story
is
told
of
the
answer
of
themistocles
in
a
wrangle
with
a
certain
seriphian
who
asserted
that
he
owed
his
brilliant
position
to
the
reputation
of
his
country
not
to
his
own
if
i
had
been
a
seriphian
said
he
even
i
should
never
have
been
famous
nor
would
you
if
you
had
been
an
athenian
something
like
this
may
be
said
of
old
age
for
the
philosopher
himself
could
not
find
old
age
easy
to
bear
in
the
depths
of
poverty
nor
the
fool
feel
it
anything
but
a
burden
though
he
were
a
millionaire
you
may
be
sure
my
dear
scipio
and
laelius
that
the
arms
best
adapted
to
old
age
are
culture
and
the
active
exercise
of
the
virtues
for
if
they
have
been
maintained
at
every
period
if
one
has
lived
much
as
well
as
long
the
harvest
they
produce
is
wonderful
not
only
because
they
never
fail
us
even
in
our
last
days
though
that
in
itself
is
supremely
important
but
also
because
the
consciousness
of
a
life
and
the
recollection
of
many
virtuous
actions
are
exceedingly
delightful
take
the
case
of
fabius
maximus
the
man
i
mean
who
recovered
tarentum
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
he
an
old
one
i
was
as
much
attached
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
contemporary
for
that
great
man
serious
dignity
was
tempered
by
courteous
manners
nor
had
old
age
made
any
change
in
his
character
true
he
was
not
exactly
an
old
man
when
my
devotion
to
him
began
yet
he
was
nevertheless
well
on
in
life
for
his
first
consulship
fell
in
the
year
after
my
birth
when
quite
a
stripling
i
went
with
him
in
his
fourth
consulship
as
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
on
the
expedition
against
capua
and
in
the
fifth
year
after
that
against
tarentum
four
years
after
that
i
was
elected
quaestor
holding
office
in
the
consulship
of
tuditanus
and
cethegus
in
which
year
indeed
he
as
a
very
old
man
spoke
in
favour
of
the
cincian
law
on
gifts
and
fees
now
this
man
conducted
wars
with
all
the
spirit
of
youth
when
he
was
far
advanced
in
life
and
by
his
persistence
gradually
wearied
out
hannibal
when
rioting
in
all
the
confidence
of
youth
how
brilliant
are
those
lines
of
my
friend
ennius
on
him
for
us
down
beaten
by
the
storms
of
fate
one
man
by
wise
delays
restored
the
state
praise
or
dispraise
moved
not
his
constant
mood
true
to
his
purpose
to
his
country
good
down
avenues
of
fame
thus
shines
and
shall
shine
still
his
glorious
name
again
what
vigilance
what
profound
skill
did
he
show
in
the
capture
of
tarentum
it
was
indeed
in
my
hearing
that
he
made
the
famous
retort
to
salinator
who
had
retreated
into
the
citadel
after
losing
the
town
it
was
owing
to
me
quintus
fabius
that
you
retook
tarentum
quite
so
he
replied
with
a
laugh
for
had
you
not
lost
it
i
should
never
have
recovered
it
nor
was
he
less
eminent
in
civil
life
than
in
war
in
his
second
consulship
though
his
colleague
would
not
move
in
the
matter
he
resisted
as
long
as
he
could
the
proposal
of
the
tribune
flaminius
to
divide
the
territory
of
the
picenians
and
gauls
in
free
allotments
in
defiance
of
a
resolution
of
the
senate
again
though
he
was
an
augur
he
ventured
to
say
that
whatever
was
done
in
the
interests
of
the
state
was
done
with
the
best
possible
auspices
that
any
laws
proposed
against
its
interest
were
proposed
against
the
auspices
i
was
cognisant
of
much
that
was
admirable
in
that
great
man
but
nothing
struck
me
with
greater
astonishment
than
the
way
in
which
he
bore
the
death
of
his
son
a
man
of
brilliant
character
and
who
had
been
consul
his
funeral
speech
over
him
is
in
wide
circulation
and
when
we
read
it
is
there
any
philosopher
of
whom
we
do
not
think
meanly
nor
in
truth
was
he
only
great
in
the
light
of
day
and
in
the
sight
of
his
he
was
still
more
eminent
in
private
and
at
home
what
a
wealth
of
conversation
what
weighty
maxims
what
a
wide
acquaintance
with
ancient
history
what
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
science
of
augury
for
a
roman
too
he
had
a
great
tincture
of
letters
he
had
a
tenacious
memory
for
military
history
of
every
sort
whether
of
roman
or
foreign
wars
and
i
used
at
that
time
to
enjoy
his
conversation
with
a
passionate
eagerness
as
though
i
already
divined
what
actually
turned
out
to
be
the
case
that
when
he
died
there
would
be
no
one
to
teach
me
anything
what
then
is
the
purpose
of
such
a
long
disquisition
on
maximus
it
is
because
you
now
see
that
an
old
age
like
his
can
not
conscientiously
be
called
unhappy
yet
it
is
after
all
true
that
everybody
can
not
be
a
scipio
or
a
maximus
with
stormings
of
cities
with
battles
by
land
and
sea
with
wars
in
which
they
themselves
commanded
and
with
triumphs
to
recall
besides
this
there
is
a
quiet
pure
and
cultivated
life
which
produces
a
calm
and
gentle
old
age
such
as
we
have
been
told
was
who
died
at
his
in
his
year
or
like
that
of
isocrates
who
says
that
he
wrote
the
book
called
the
panegyric
in
his
year
and
who
lived
for
five
years
afterwards
while
his
master
gorgias
of
leontini
completed
a
hundred
and
seven
years
without
ever
relaxing
his
diligence
or
giving
up
work
when
some
one
asked
him
why
he
consented
to
remain
so
long
alive
i
have
no
fault
said
he
to
find
with
old
age
that
was
a
noble
answer
and
worthy
of
a
scholar
for
fools
impute
their
own
frailties
and
guilt
to
old
age
contrary
to
the
practice
of
ennui
whom
i
mentioned
just
now
in
the
lines
like
some
brave
steed
that
oft
before
the
olympic
wreath
of
victory
bore
now
by
the
weight
of
years
oppressed
forgets
the
race
and
takes
his
rest
he
compares
his
own
old
age
to
that
of
a
and
successful
and
him
indeed
you
may
very
well
remember
for
the
present
consuls
titus
flamininus
and
manius
acilius
were
elected
in
the
nineteenth
year
after
his
death
and
his
death
occurred
in
the
consulship
of
caepio
and
philippus
the
latter
consul
for
the
second
time
in
which
year
i
then
years
old
spoke
in
favour
of
the
voconian
law
in
a
voice
that
was
still
strong
and
with
lungs
still
sound
while
be
though
seventy
years
old
supported
two
burdens
considered
the
heaviest
of
all
poverty
and
old
age
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
all
but
fond
of
them
the
fact
is
that
when
i
come
to
think
it
over
i
find
that
there
are
four
reasons
for
old
age
being
thought
unhappy
first
that
it
withdraws
us
from
active
employments
second
that
it
enfeebles
the
body
third
that
it
deprives
us
of
nearly
all
physical
pleasures
fourth
that
it
is
the
next
step
to
death
of
each
of
these
reasons
if
you
will
allow
me
let
us
examine
the
force
and
justice
separately
old
age
withdraws
us
from
active
employments
from
which
of
them
do
you
mean
from
those
carried
on
by
youth
and
bodily
strength
are
there
then
no
old
men
employments
to
be
after
all
conducted
by
the
intellect
even
when
bodies
are
weak
so
then
maximus
did
nothing
nor
aemilius
our
father
scipio
and
my
excellent
so
with
other
old
men
the
fabricii
the
guru
and
coruncanii
when
they
were
supporting
the
state
by
their
advice
and
influence
they
were
doing
nothing
to
old
age
appius
claudius
had
the
additional
disadvantage
of
being
blind
yet
it
was
he
who
when
the
senate
was
inclining
towards
a
peace
with
pyrrhus
and
was
for
making
a
treaty
did
not
hesitate
to
say
what
ennius
has
embalmed
in
the
verses
whither
have
swerved
the
souls
so
firm
of
yore
is
sense
grown
senseless
can
feet
stand
no
more
and
so
on
in
a
tone
of
the
most
passionate
vehemence
you
know
the
poem
and
the
speech
of
appius
himself
is
extant
now
he
delivered
it
seventeen
years
after
his
second
consulship
there
having
been
an
interval
of
ten
years
between
the
two
consulships
and
he
having
been
censor
before
his
previous
consulship
this
will
show
you
that
at
the
time
of
the
war
with
pyrrhus
he
was
a
very
old
man
yet
this
is
the
story
handed
down
to
us
there
is
therefore
nothing
in
the
arguments
of
those
who
say
that
old
age
takes
no
part
in
public
business
they
are
like
men
who
would
say
that
a
steersman
does
nothing
in
sailing
a
ship
because
while
some
of
the
crew
are
climbing
the
masts
others
hurrying
up
and
down
the
gangways
others
pumping
out
the
bilge
water
he
sits
quietly
in
the
stern
holding
the
tiller
he
does
not
do
what
young
men
do
nevertheless
he
does
what
is
much
more
important
and
better
the
great
affairs
of
life
are
not
performed
by
physical
strength
or
activity
or
nimbleness
of
body
but
by
deliberation
character
expression
of
opinion
of
these
old
age
is
not
only
not
deprived
but
as
a
rule
has
them
in
a
greater
degree
unless
by
any
chance
i
who
as
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
as
military
tribune
as
legate
and
as
consul
have
been
employed
in
various
kinds
of
war
now
appear
to
you
to
be
idle
because
not
actively
engaged
in
war
but
i
enjoin
upon
the
senate
what
is
to
be
done
and
how
carthage
has
long
been
harbouring
evil
designs
and
i
accordingly
proclaim
war
against
her
in
good
time
i
shall
never
cease
to
entertain
fears
about
her
till
i
bear
of
her
having
been
levelled
with
the
ground
the
glory
of
doing
that
i
pray
that
the
immortal
gods
may
reserve
for
you
scipio
so
that
you
may
complete
the
task
begun
by
your
now
dead
more
than
years
ago
though
all
years
to
come
will
keep
that
great
man
memory
green
he
died
in
the
year
before
my
censorship
nine
years
after
my
consulship
having
been
returned
consul
for
the
second
time
in
my
own
consulship
if
then
he
had
lived
to
his
hundredth
year
would
he
have
regretted
having
lived
to
be
old
for
he
would
of
course
not
have
been
practising
rapid
marches
nor
dashing
on
a
foe
nor
hurling
spears
from
a
distance
nor
using
swords
at
close
quarters
but
only
counsel
reason
and
senatorial
eloquence
and
if
those
qualities
had
not
resided
in
us
our
ancestors
would
never
have
called
their
supreme
council
a
senate
at
sparta
indeed
those
who
hold
the
highest
magistracies
are
in
accordance
with
the
fact
actually
called
elders
but
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
read
or
listen
to
foreign
history
you
will
find
that
the
mightiest
states
have
been
brought
into
peril
by
young
men
have
been
supported
and
restored
by
old
the
question
occurs
in
the
poet
naevius
pray
who
are
those
who
brought
your
state
with
such
despatch
to
meet
its
fate
there
is
a
long
answer
but
this
is
the
chief
point
a
crop
of
orators
we
grew
and
foolish
paltry
lads
who
thought
they
knew
for
of
course
rashness
is
the
note
of
youth
prudence
of
old
age
but
it
is
said
memory
dwindles
no
doubt
unless
you
keep
it
in
practice
or
if
you
happen
to
be
somewhat
dull
by
nature
themistocles
had
the
names
of
all
his
by
heart
do
you
imagine
that
in
his
old
age
he
used
to
address
aristides
as
lysimachus
for
my
part
i
know
not
only
the
present
generation
but
their
fathers
also
and
their
grandfathers
nor
have
i
any
fear
of
losing
my
memory
by
reading
tombstones
according
to
the
vulgar
superstition
on
the
contrary
by
reading
them
i
renew
my
memory
of
those
who
are
dead
and
gone
nor
in
point
of
fact
have
i
ever
heard
of
any
old
man
forgetting
where
he
had
hidden
his
money
they
remember
everything
that
interests
them
when
to
answer
to
their
bail
business
appointments
who
owes
them
money
and
to
whom
they
owe
it
what
about
lawyers
pontiffs
augurs
philosophers
when
old
what
a
multitude
of
things
they
remember
old
men
retain
their
intellects
well
enough
if
only
they
keep
their
minds
active
and
fully
employed
nor
is
that
the
case
only
with
men
of
high
position
and
great
office
it
applies
equally
to
private
life
and
peaceful
pursuits
sophocles
composed
tragedies
to
extreme
old
age
and
being
believed
to
neglect
the
care
of
his
property
owing
to
his
devotion
to
his
art
his
sons
brought
him
into
court
to
get
a
judicial
decision
depriving
him
of
the
management
of
his
property
on
the
ground
of
weak
intellect
just
as
in
our
law
it
is
customary
to
deprive
a
paterfamilias
of
the
management
of
his
property
if
he
is
squandering
it
there
upon
the
old
poet
is
said
to
have
read
to
the
judges
the
play
he
had
on
hand
and
had
just
composed
the
and
to
have
asked
them
whether
they
thought
that
the
work
of
a
man
of
weak
intellect
after
the
reading
he
was
acquitted
by
the
jury
did
old
age
then
compel
this
man
to
become
silent
in
his
particular
art
or
homer
hesiod
simonides
or
isocrates
and
gorgias
whom
i
mentioned
before
or
the
founders
of
schools
of
philosophy
pythagoras
democritus
plato
xenocrates
or
later
zeno
and
cleanthus
or
diogenes
the
stoic
whom
you
too
saw
at
rome
is
it
not
rather
the
case
with
all
these
that
the
active
pursuit
of
study
only
ended
with
life
but
to
pass
over
these
sublime
studies
i
can
name
some
rustic
romans
from
the
sabine
district
neighbours
and
friends
of
my
own
without
whose
presence
farm
work
of
importance
is
scarcely
ever
performed
whether
sowing
or
harvesting
or
storing
crops
and
yet
in
other
things
this
is
less
surprising
for
no
one
is
so
old
as
to
think
that
he
may
not
live
a
year
but
they
bestow
their
labour
on
what
they
know
does
not
affect
them
in
any
case
he
plants
his
trees
to
serve
a
race
to
come
as
our
poet
statius
says
in
his
comrades
nor
indeed
would
a
farmer
however
old
hesitate
to
answer
any
one
who
asked
him
for
whom
he
was
planting
for
the
immortal
gods
whose
will
it
was
that
i
should
not
merely
receive
these
things
from
my
ancestors
but
should
also
hand
them
on
to
the
next
generation
that
remark
about
the
old
man
is
better
than
the
following
if
age
brought
nothing
worse
than
this
it
were
enough
to
mar
our
bliss
that
he
who
bides
for
many
years
sees
much
to
shun
and
much
for
tears
yes
and
perhaps
much
that
gives
him
pleasure
too
besides
as
to
subjects
for
tears
he
often
comes
upon
them
in
youth
as
well
a
still
more
questionable
sentiment
in
the
same
caecilius
is
no
greater
misery
can
of
age
be
told
than
this
be
sure
the
young
dislike
the
old
delight
in
them
is
nearer
the
mark
than
dislike
for
just
as
old
men
if
they
are
wise
take
pleasure
in
the
society
of
young
men
of
good
parts
and
as
old
age
is
rendered
less
dreary
for
those
who
are
courted
and
liked
by
the
youth
so
also
do
young
men
find
pleasure
in
the
maxims
of
the
old
by
which
they
are
drawn
to
the
pursuit
of
excellence
nor
do
i
perceive
that
you
find
my
society
less
pleasant
than
i
do
yours
but
this
is
enough
to
show
you
how
so
far
from
being
listless
and
sluggish
old
age
is
even
a
busy
time
always
doing
and
attempting
something
of
course
of
the
same
nature
as
each
man
taste
had
been
in
the
previous
part
of
his
life
nay
do
not
some
even
add
to
their
stock
of
learning
we
see
solon
for
instance
boasting
in
his
poems
that
he
grows
old
daily
learning
something
new
or
again
in
my
own
case
it
was
only
when
an
old
man
that
i
became
acquainted
with
greek
literature
which
in
fact
i
absorbed
with
such
avidity
in
my
yearning
to
quench
as
it
were
a
thirst
that
i
became
acquainted
with
the
very
facts
which
you
see
me
now
using
as
precedents
when
i
heard
what
socrates
had
done
about
the
lyre
i
should
have
liked
for
my
part
to
have
done
that
too
for
the
ancients
used
to
learn
the
lyre
but
at
any
rate
i
worked
hard
at
literature
nor
again
do
i
now
miss
the
bodily
strength
of
a
young
man
for
that
was
the
second
point
as
to
the
disadvantages
of
old
age
any
more
than
as
a
young
man
i
missed
the
strength
of
a
bull
or
an
elephant
you
should
use
what
you
have
and
whatever
you
may
chance
to
be
doing
do
it
with
all
your
might
what
could
be
weaker
than
milo
of
exclamation
when
in
his
old
age
he
was
watching
some
athletes
practising
in
the
course
he
is
said
to
have
looked
at
his
arms
and
to
have
exclaimed
with
tears
in
his
eyes
ah
well
these
are
now
as
good
as
dead
not
a
bit
more
so
than
yourself
you
trifler
for
at
no
time
were
you
made
famous
by
your
real
self
but
by
chest
and
biceps
sext
aelius
never
gave
vent
to
such
a
remark
nor
many
years
before
him
titus
coruncanius
nor
more
recently
crassus
all
of
them
learned
in
active
practice
whose
knowledge
of
their
profession
was
maintained
to
their
last
breath
i
am
afraid
an
orator
does
lose
vigour
by
old
age
for
his
art
is
not
a
matter
of
the
intellect
alone
but
of
lungs
and
bodily
strength
though
as
a
rule
that
musical
ring
in
the
voice
even
gains
in
brilliance
in
a
certain
way
as
one
grows
old
certainly
i
have
not
yet
lost
it
and
you
see
my
years
yet
after
all
the
style
of
speech
suitable
to
an
old
man
is
the
quiet
and
unemotional
and
it
often
happens
that
the
chastened
and
calm
delivery
of
an
old
man
eloquent
secures
a
hearing
if
you
can
not
attain
to
that
yourself
you
might
still
instruct
a
scipio
and
a
laelius
for
what
is
more
charming
than
old
age
surrounded
by
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
shall
we
not
allow
old
age
even
the
strength
to
teach
the
young
to
train
and
equip
them
for
all
the
duties
of
life
and
what
can
be
a
nobler
employment
for
my
part
i
used
to
think
publius
and
gnaeus
scipio
and
your
two
grandfathers
aemilius
and
africanus
fortunate
men
when
i
saw
them
with
a
company
of
young
nobles
about
them
nor
should
we
think
any
teachers
of
the
fine
arts
otherwise
than
happy
however
much
their
bodily
forces
may
have
decayed
and
failed
and
yet
that
same
failure
of
the
bodily
forces
is
more
often
brought
about
by
the
vices
of
youth
than
of
old
age
for
a
dissolute
and
intemperate
youth
hands
down
the
body
to
old
age
in
a
state
xenophon
cyrus
for
instance
in
his
discourse
delivered
on
his
and
at
a
very
advanced
age
says
that
he
never
perceived
his
old
age
to
have
become
weaker
than
his
youth
had
been
i
remember
as
a
boy
lucius
metellus
who
having
been
created
pontifex
maximus
four
years
after
his
second
consulship
held
that
office
years
enjoying
such
excellent
strength
of
body
in
the
very
last
hours
of
his
life
as
not
to
miss
his
youth
i
need
not
speak
of
myself
though
that
indeed
is
an
old
man
way
and
is
generally
allowed
to
my
time
of
life
do
you
see
in
homer
how
frequently
nestor
talks
of
his
own
good
qualities
for
he
was
living
through
a
third
generation
nor
had
he
any
reason
to
fear
that
upon
saying
what
was
true
about
himself
he
should
appear
either
over
vain
or
talkative
for
as
homer
says
from
his
lips
flowed
discourse
sweeter
than
honey
for
which
sweet
breath
he
wanted
no
bodily
strength
and
yet
after
all
the
famous
leader
of
the
greeks
nowhere
wishes
to
have
ten
men
like
ajax
but
like
nestor
if
he
could
get
them
he
feels
no
doubt
of
troy
shortly
falling
but
to
return
to
my
own
case
i
am
in
my
year
i
could
wish
that
i
had
been
able
to
make
the
same
boast
as
cyrus
but
after
all
i
can
say
this
i
am
not
indeed
as
vigorous
as
i
was
as
a
private
soldier
in
the
punic
war
or
as
quaestor
in
the
same
war
or
as
consul
in
spain
and
four
years
later
when
as
a
military
tribune
i
took
part
in
the
engagement
at
thermopylae
under
the
consul
manius
acilius
glabrio
but
yet
as
you
see
old
age
has
not
entirely
destroyed
my
muscles
has
not
quite
brought
me
to
the
ground
the
does
not
find
all
my
vigour
gone
nor
the
rostra
nor
my
friends
nor
my
clients
nor
my
foreign
guests
for
i
have
never
given
in
to
that
ancient
and
proverb
old
when
young
is
old
for
long
for
myself
i
had
rather
be
an
old
man
a
somewhat
shorter
time
than
an
old
man
my
time
accordingly
no
one
up
to
the
present
has
wished
to
see
me
to
whom
i
have
been
denied
as
engaged
but
it
may
be
said
i
have
less
strength
than
either
of
you
neither
have
you
the
strength
of
the
centurion
pontius
is
he
the
more
eminent
man
on
that
account
let
there
be
only
a
proper
husbanding
of
strength
and
let
each
man
proportion
his
efforts
to
his
powers
such
an
one
will
assuredly
not
be
possessed
with
any
great
regret
for
his
loss
of
strength
at
olympia
milo
is
said
to
have
stepped
into
the
course
carrying
a
live
ox
on
his
shoulders
which
then
of
the
two
would
you
prefer
to
have
given
to
you
bodily
strength
like
that
or
intellectual
strength
like
that
of
pythagoras
in
fine
enjoy
that
blessing
when
you
have
it
when
it
is
gone
do
wish
it
back
unless
we
are
to
think
that
young
men
should
wish
their
childhood
back
and
those
somewhat
older
their
youth
the
course
of
life
is
fixed
and
nature
admits
of
its
being
run
but
in
one
way
and
only
once
and
to
each
part
of
our
life
there
is
something
specially
seasonable
so
that
the
feebleness
of
children
as
well
as
the
high
spirit
of
youth
the
soberness
of
maturer
years
and
the
ripe
wisdom
of
old
age
all
have
a
certain
natural
advantage
which
should
be
secured
in
its
proper
season
i
think
you
are
informed
scipio
what
your
grandfather
foreign
friend
masinissa
does
to
this
day
though
ninety
years
old
when
he
has
once
begun
a
journey
on
foot
he
does
not
mount
his
horse
at
all
when
on
horseback
he
never
gets
off
his
horse
by
no
rain
or
cold
can
he
be
induced
to
cover
his
head
his
body
is
absolutely
free
from
unhealthy
humours
and
so
he
still
performs
all
the
duties
and
functions
of
a
king
active
exercise
therefore
and
temperance
can
preserve
some
part
of
one
former
strength
even
in
old
age
bodily
strength
is
wanting
to
old
age
but
neither
is
bodily
strength
demanded
from
old
men
therefore
both
by
law
and
custom
men
of
my
time
of
life
are
exempt
from
those
duties
which
can
not
be
supported
without
bodily
strength
accordingly
not
only
are
we
not
forced
to
do
what
we
can
not
do
we
are
not
even
obliged
to
do
as
much
as
we
can
but
it
will
be
said
many
old
men
are
so
feeble
that
they
can
not
perform
any
duty
in
life
of
any
sort
or
kind
that
is
not
a
weakness
to
be
set
down
as
peculiar
to
old
age
it
is
one
shared
by
ill
health
how
feeble
was
the
son
of
africanus
who
adopted
you
what
weak
health
he
had
or
rather
no
health
at
all
if
that
had
not
been
the
case
we
should
have
had
in
him
a
second
brilliant
light
in
the
political
horizon
for
he
had
added
a
wider
cultivation
to
his
greatness
of
spirit
what
wonder
then
that
old
men
are
eventually
feeble
when
even
young
men
can
not
escape
it
my
dear
laelius
and
scipio
we
must
stand
up
against
old
age
and
make
up
for
its
drawbacks
by
taking
pains
we
must
fight
it
as
we
should
an
illness
we
must
look
after
our
health
use
moderate
exercise
take
just
enough
food
and
drink
to
recruit
but
not
to
overload
our
strength
nor
is
it
the
body
alone
that
must
be
supported
but
the
intellect
and
soul
much
more
for
they
are
like
lamps
unless
you
feed
them
with
oil
they
too
go
out
from
old
age
again
the
body
is
apt
to
get
gross
from
exercise
but
the
intellect
becomes
nimbler
by
exercising
itself
for
what
caecilius
means
by
old
dotards
of
the
comic
stage
are
the
credulous
the
forgetful
and
the
slipshod
these
are
faults
that
do
not
attach
to
old
age
as
such
but
to
a
sluggish
spiritless
and
sleepy
old
age
young
men
are
more
frequently
wanton
and
dissolute
than
old
men
but
yet
as
it
is
not
all
young
men
that
are
so
but
the
bad
set
among
them
even
so
senile
folly
usually
called
imbecility
applies
to
old
men
of
unsound
character
not
to
all
appius
governed
four
sturdy
sons
five
daughters
that
great
establishment
and
all
those
clients
though
he
was
both
old
and
blind
for
he
kept
his
mind
at
full
stretch
like
a
how
and
never
gave
in
to
old
age
by
growing
slack
he
maintained
not
merely
an
influence
but
an
absolute
command
over
his
family
his
slaves
feared
him
his
sons
were
in
awe
of
him
all
loved
him
in
that
family
indeed
ancestral
custom
and
discipline
were
in
full
vigour
the
fact
is
that
old
age
is
respectable
just
as
long
as
it
asserts
itself
maintains
its
proper
rights
and
is
not
enslaved
to
any
one
for
as
i
admire
a
young
man
who
has
something
of
the
old
man
in
him
so
do
i
an
old
one
who
has
something
of
a
young
man
the
man
who
aims
at
this
may
possibly
become
old
in
body
in
mind
he
never
will
i
am
now
engaged
in
composing
the
seventh
book
of
my
i
collect
all
the
records
of
antiquity
the
speeches
delivered
in
all
the
celebrated
cases
which
i
have
defended
i
am
at
this
particular
time
getting
into
shape
for
publication
i
am
writing
treatises
on
augural
pontifical
and
civil
law
i
am
besides
studying
hard
at
greek
and
after
the
manner
of
the
pythagoreans
to
keep
my
memory
in
working
order
i
repeat
in
the
evening
whatever
i
have
said
heard
or
done
in
the
course
of
each
day
these
are
the
exercises
of
the
intellect
these
the
training
grounds
of
the
mind
while
i
sweat
and
labour
on
these
i
do
much
feel
the
loss
of
bodily
strength
i
appear
in
court
for
my
friends
i
frequently
attend
the
senate
and
bring
motions
before
it
on
my
own
responsibility
prepared
after
deep
and
long
reflection
and
these
i
support
by
my
intellectual
not
my
bodily
forces
and
if
i
were
not
strong
enough
to
do
these
things
yet
i
should
enjoy
my
sofa
imagining
the
very
operations
which
i
was
now
unable
to
perform
but
what
makes
me
capable
of
doing
this
is
my
past
life
for
a
man
who
is
always
living
in
the
midst
of
these
studies
and
labours
does
not
perceive
when
old
age
creeps
upon
him
thus
by
slow
and
imperceptible
degrees
life
draws
to
its
end
there
is
no
sudden
breakage
it
just
slowly
goes
out
the
third
charge
against
old
age
is
that
it
lacks
sensual
pleasures
what
a
splendid
service
does
old
age
render
if
it
takes
from
us
the
greatest
blot
of
youth
listen
my
dear
young
friends
to
a
speech
of
archytas
of
tarentum
among
the
greatest
and
most
illustrious
of
men
which
was
put
into
my
hands
when
as
a
young
man
i
was
at
tarentum
with
maximus
no
more
deadly
curse
than
sensual
pleasure
has
been
inflicted
on
mankind
by
nature
to
gratify
which
our
wanton
appetites
are
roused
beyond
all
prudence
or
restraint
it
is
a
fruitful
source
of
treasons
revolutions
secret
communications
with
the
enemy
in
fact
there
is
no
crime
no
evil
deed
to
which
the
appetite
for
sensual
pleasures
does
not
impel
us
fornications
and
adulteries
and
every
abomination
of
that
kind
are
brought
about
by
the
enticements
of
pleasure
and
by
them
alone
intellect
is
the
best
gift
of
nature
or
god
to
this
divine
gift
and
endowment
there
is
nothing
so
inimical
as
pleasure
for
when
appetite
is
our
master
there
is
no
place
for
nor
where
pleasure
reigns
supreme
can
virtue
hold
its
ground
to
see
this
more
vividly
imagine
a
man
excited
to
the
highest
conceivable
pitch
of
sensual
pleasure
it
can
be
doubtful
to
no
one
that
such
a
person
so
long
as
he
is
under
the
influence
of
such
excitation
of
the
senses
will
be
unable
to
use
to
any
purpose
either
intellect
reason
or
thought
therefore
nothing
can
be
so
execrable
and
so
fatal
as
pleasure
since
when
more
than
ordinarily
violent
and
lasting
it
darkens
all
the
light
of
the
soul
these
were
the
words
addressed
by
archytas
to
the
samnite
caius
pontius
father
of
the
man
by
whom
the
consuls
spurius
postumius
and
titus
veturius
were
beaten
in
the
battle
of
caudium
my
friend
nearchus
of
tarentum
who
had
remained
loyal
to
rome
told
me
that
he
had
heard
them
repeated
by
some
old
men
and
that
plato
the
athenian
was
present
who
visited
tarentum
i
find
in
the
consulship
of
camillus
and
appius
claudius
what
is
the
point
of
all
this
it
is
to
show
you
that
if
we
were
unable
to
scorn
pleasure
by
the
aid
of
reason
and
philosophy
we
ought
to
have
been
very
grateful
to
old
age
for
depriving
us
of
all
inclination
for
that
which
it
was
wrong
to
do
for
pleasure
hinders
thought
is
a
foe
to
reason
and
so
to
speak
blinds
the
eyes
of
the
mind
it
is
moreover
entirely
alien
to
virtue
i
was
sorry
to
have
to
expel
lucius
brother
of
the
gallant
titus
flamininus
from
the
senate
seven
years
after
his
consulship
but
i
thought
it
imperative
to
affix
a
stigma
on
an
act
of
gross
sensuality
for
when
he
was
in
gaul
as
consul
he
had
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
his
paramour
at
a
to
behead
a
man
who
happened
to
be
in
prison
condemned
on
a
capital
charge
when
his
brother
titus
was
censor
who
preceded
me
he
escaped
but
i
and
flaccus
could
not
countenance
an
act
of
such
criminal
and
abandoned
lust
especially
as
besides
the
personal
dishonour
it
brought
disgrace
on
the
government
i
have
often
been
told
by
men
older
than
myself
who
said
that
they
had
heard
it
as
boys
from
old
men
that
gaius
fabricius
was
in
the
habit
of
expressing
astonishment
at
having
heard
when
envoy
at
the
headquarters
of
king
pyrrhus
from
the
thessalian
cineas
that
there
was
a
man
of
athens
who
professed
to
be
a
philosopher
and
affirmed
that
everything
we
did
was
to
be
referred
to
pleasure
when
he
told
this
to
manius
curius
and
publius
decius
they
used
to
remark
that
they
wished
that
the
samnites
and
pyrrhus
himself
would
hold
the
same
opinion
it
would
be
much
easier
to
conquer
them
if
they
had
once
given
themselves
over
to
sensual
indulgences
manius
curius
had
been
intimate
with
decius
who
four
years
before
the
former
consulship
had
devoted
himself
to
death
for
the
republic
both
fabricius
and
coruncanius
knew
him
also
and
from
the
experience
of
their
own
lives
as
well
as
from
the
action
of
decius
they
were
of
opinion
that
there
did
exist
something
intrinsically
noble
and
great
which
was
sought
for
its
own
sake
and
at
which
all
the
best
men
aimed
to
the
contempt
and
neglect
of
pleasure
why
then
do
i
spend
so
many
words
on
the
subject
of
pleasure
why
because
far
from
being
a
charge
against
old
age
that
it
does
not
much
feel
the
want
of
any
pleasures
it
is
its
highest
praise
but
you
will
say
it
is
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
the
heaped
up
board
the
rapid
passing
of
the
well
then
it
is
also
free
from
headache
disordered
digestion
broken
sleep
but
if
we
must
grant
pleasure
something
since
we
do
not
find
it
easy
to
resist
its
charms
for
plato
with
happy
inspiration
calls
pleasure
bait
because
of
course
men
are
caught
by
it
as
fish
by
a
hook
yet
although
old
age
has
to
abstain
from
extravagant
banquets
it
is
still
capable
of
enjoying
modest
festivities
as
a
boy
i
often
used
to
see
gaius
duilius
the
son
of
marcus
then
an
old
mali
returning
from
a
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
frequent
use
of
torch
and
distinctions
which
he
had
assumed
though
unprecedented
in
the
case
of
a
private
person
it
was
the
privilege
of
his
glory
but
why
mention
others
i
will
come
back
to
my
own
case
to
begin
with
i
have
always
remained
a
member
of
a
club
clubs
you
know
were
established
in
my
quaestorship
on
the
reception
of
the
magna
mater
from
ida
so
i
used
to
dine
at
their
feast
with
the
members
of
my
club
on
the
whole
with
moderation
though
there
was
a
certain
warmth
of
temperament
natural
to
my
time
of
life
but
as
that
advances
there
is
a
daily
decrease
of
all
excitement
nor
was
i
in
fact
ever
wont
to
measure
my
enjoyment
even
of
these
banquets
by
the
physical
pleasures
they
gave
more
than
by
the
gathering
and
conversation
of
friends
for
it
was
a
good
idea
of
our
ancestors
to
style
the
presence
of
guests
at
a
seeing
that
it
implied
a
community
of
enjoyment
a
a
living
together
it
is
a
better
term
than
the
greek
words
which
mean
a
drinking
together
or
an
eating
together
for
they
would
seem
to
give
the
preference
to
what
is
really
the
least
important
part
of
it
for
myself
owing
to
the
pleasure
i
take
in
conversation
i
enjoy
even
banquets
that
begin
early
in
the
afternoon
and
not
only
in
company
with
my
contemporaries
of
whom
very
few
survive
but
also
with
men
of
your
age
and
with
yourselves
i
am
thankful
to
old
age
which
has
increased
my
avidity
for
conversation
while
it
has
removed
that
for
eating
and
drinking
but
if
anyone
does
enjoy
these
not
to
seem
to
have
proclaimed
war
against
all
pleasure
without
exception
which
is
perhaps
a
feeling
inspired
by
nature
i
fail
to
perceive
even
in
these
very
pleasures
that
old
age
is
entirely
without
the
power
of
appreciation
for
myself
i
take
delight
even
in
the
appointment
of
master
of
the
feast
and
in
the
arrangement
of
the
conversation
which
according
to
ancestral
custom
is
begun
from
the
last
place
on
the
couch
when
the
wine
is
brought
in
as
also
in
the
cups
which
as
in
xenophon
banquet
are
small
and
filled
by
driblets
and
in
the
contrivance
for
cooling
in
summer
and
for
warming
by
the
winter
sun
or
winter
fire
these
things
i
keep
up
even
among
my
sabine
countrymen
and
every
day
have
a
full
of
neighbours
which
we
prolong
as
far
into
the
night
as
we
can
with
varied
conversation
but
you
may
urge
there
is
not
the
same
tingling
sensation
of
pleasure
in
old
men
no
doubt
but
neither
do
they
miss
it
so
much
for
nothing
gives
you
uneasiness
which
you
do
not
miss
that
was
a
fine
answer
of
sophocles
to
a
man
who
asked
him
when
in
extreme
old
age
whether
he
was
still
a
lover
heaven
forbid
he
replied
i
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
that
as
though
from
a
boorish
and
insane
master
to
men
indeed
who
are
keen
after
such
things
it
may
possibly
appear
disagreeable
and
uncomfortable
to
be
without
them
but
to
jaded
appetites
it
is
pleasanter
to
lack
than
to
enjoy
however
he
can
not
be
said
to
lack
who
does
not
want
my
contention
is
that
not
to
want
is
the
pleasanter
thing
but
even
granting
that
youth
enjoys
these
pleasures
with
more
zest
in
the
first
place
they
are
insignificant
things
to
enjoy
as
i
have
said
and
in
the
second
place
such
as
age
is
not
entirely
without
if
it
does
not
possess
them
in
profusion
just
as
a
man
gets
greater
pleasure
from
ambivius
turpio
if
seated
in
the
front
row
at
the
theatre
than
if
he
was
in
the
last
yet
after
all
the
man
in
the
last
row
does
get
pleasure
so
youth
because
it
looks
at
pleasures
at
closer
quarters
perhaps
enjoys
itself
more
yet
even
old
age
looking
at
them
from
a
distance
does
enjoy
itself
well
enough
why
what
blessings
are
these
that
the
soul
having
served
its
time
so
to
speak
in
the
campaigns
of
desire
and
ambition
rivalry
and
hatred
and
all
the
passions
should
live
in
its
own
thoughts
and
as
the
expression
goes
should
dwell
apart
indeed
if
it
has
in
store
any
of
what
i
may
call
the
food
of
study
and
philosophy
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
than
an
old
age
of
leisure
we
were
witnesses
to
gallus
a
friend
of
your
father
scipio
intent
to
the
day
of
his
death
on
mapping
out
the
sky
and
land
how
often
did
the
light
surprise
him
while
still
working
out
a
problem
begun
during
the
night
how
often
did
night
find
him
busy
on
what
he
had
begun
at
dawn
how
he
delighted
in
predicting
for
us
solar
and
lunar
eclipses
long
before
they
occurred
or
again
in
studies
of
a
lighter
nature
though
still
requiring
keenness
of
intellect
what
pleasure
naevius
took
in
his
plautus
in
his
and
i
even
saw
livius
andronicus
who
having
produced
a
play
six
years
before
i
was
born
in
the
consulship
of
cento
and
tuditanus
lived
till
i
had
become
a
young
man
why
speak
of
publius
licinius
crassus
devotion
to
pontifical
and
civil
law
or
of
the
publius
scipio
of
the
present
time
who
within
these
last
few
days
has
been
created
pontifex
maximus
and
yet
i
have
seen
all
whom
i
have
mentioned
ardent
in
these
pursuits
when
old
men
then
there
is
marcus
cethegus
whom
ennius
justly
called
persuasion
marrow
with
what
enthusiasm
did
we
see
him
exert
himself
in
oratory
even
when
quite
old
what
pleasures
are
there
in
feasts
games
or
mistresses
comparable
to
pleasures
such
as
these
and
they
are
all
tastes
too
connected
with
learning
which
in
men
of
sense
and
good
education
grow
with
their
growth
it
is
indeed
an
honourable
sentiment
which
solon
expresses
in
a
verse
which
i
have
quoted
before
that
he
grew
old
learning
many
a
fresh
lesson
every
day
than
that
intellectual
pleasure
none
certainly
can
be
greater
i
come
now
to
the
pleasures
of
the
farmer
in
which
i
take
amazing
delight
these
are
not
hindered
by
any
extent
of
old
age
and
seem
to
me
to
approach
nearest
to
the
ideal
wise
man
life
for
he
has
to
deal
with
the
earth
which
never
refuses
its
obedience
nor
ever
returns
what
it
has
received
without
usury
sometimes
indeed
with
less
but
generally
with
greater
interest
for
my
part
however
it
is
not
merely
the
thing
produced
but
the
earth
own
force
and
natural
productiveness
that
delight
me
for
received
in
its
bosom
the
seed
scattered
broadcast
upon
it
softened
and
broken
up
she
first
keeps
it
concealed
therein
hence
the
harrowing
which
accomplishes
this
gets
its
name
from
a
word
meaning
to
hide
next
when
it
has
been
warmed
by
her
heat
and
close
pressure
she
splits
it
open
and
draws
from
it
the
greenery
of
the
blade
this
supported
by
the
fibres
of
the
root
little
by
little
grows
up
and
held
upright
by
its
jointed
stalk
is
enclosed
in
sheaths
as
being
still
immature
when
it
has
emerged
from
them
it
produces
an
ear
of
corn
arranged
in
order
and
is
defended
against
the
pecking
of
the
smaller
birds
by
a
regular
palisade
of
spikes
need
i
mention
the
starting
planting
and
growth
of
vines
i
can
never
have
too
much
of
this
pleasure
to
let
you
into
the
secret
of
what
gives
my
old
age
repose
and
amusement
for
i
say
nothing
here
of
the
natural
force
which
all
things
propagated
from
the
earth
possess
the
earth
which
from
that
tiny
grain
in
a
fig
or
the
in
a
grape
or
the
most
minute
seeds
of
the
other
cereals
and
plants
produces
such
huge
trunks
and
boughs
slips
cuttings
quicksets
layers
are
they
not
enough
to
fill
anyone
with
delight
and
astonishment
the
vine
by
nature
is
apt
to
fall
and
unless
supported
drops
down
to
the
earth
yet
in
order
to
keep
itself
upright
it
embraces
whatever
it
reaches
with
its
tendrils
as
though
they
were
hands
then
as
it
creeps
on
spreading
itself
in
intricate
and
wild
profusion
the
dresser
art
prunes
it
with
the
knife
and
prevents
it
growing
a
forest
of
shoots
and
expanding
to
excess
in
every
direction
accordingly
at
the
beginning
of
spring
in
the
shoots
which
have
been
left
there
protrudes
at
each
of
the
joints
what
is
termed
an
from
this
the
grape
emerges
and
shows
itself
which
swollen
by
the
juice
of
the
earth
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
at
first
very
bitter
to
the
taste
but
afterwards
grows
sweet
as
it
matures
and
being
covered
with
tendrils
is
never
without
a
moderate
warmth
and
yet
is
able
to
ward
off
the
fiery
heat
of
the
sun
can
anything
be
richer
in
product
or
more
beautiful
to
contemplate
it
is
not
its
utility
only
as
i
said
before
that
charms
me
but
the
method
of
its
cultivation
and
the
natural
process
of
its
growth
the
rows
of
uprights
the
for
the
tops
of
the
plants
the
tying
up
of
the
vines
and
their
propagation
by
layers
the
pruning
to
which
i
have
already
referred
of
some
shoots
the
setting
of
others
i
need
hardly
mention
irrigation
or
trenching
and
digging
the
soil
which
much
increase
its
fertility
as
to
the
advantages
of
manuring
i
have
spoken
in
my
book
on
agriculture
the
learned
hesiod
did
not
say
a
single
word
on
this
subject
though
he
was
writing
on
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
yet
homer
who
in
my
opinion
was
many
generations
earlier
represents
laertes
as
softening
his
regret
for
his
son
by
cultivating
and
manuring
his
farm
nor
is
it
only
in
cornfields
and
meadows
and
vineyards
and
plantations
that
a
farmer
life
is
made
cheerful
there
are
the
garden
and
the
orchard
the
feeding
of
sheep
the
swarms
of
bees
endless
varieties
of
flowers
nor
is
it
only
planting
out
that
charms
there
is
also
grafting
surely
the
most
ingenious
invention
ever
made
by
husbandmen
i
might
continue
my
list
of
the
delights
of
country
life
but
even
what
i
have
said
i
think
is
somewhat
over
long
however
you
must
pardon
me
for
farming
is
a
very
favourite
hobby
of
mine
and
old
age
is
naturally
rather
garrulous
for
i
would
not
be
thought
to
acquit
it
of
all
faults
well
it
was
in
a
life
of
this
sort
that
manius
curius
after
celebrating
triumphs
over
the
samnites
the
sabines
and
pyrrhus
spent
his
last
days
when
i
look
at
his
villa
for
it
is
not
far
from
my
own
i
never
can
enough
admire
the
man
own
frugality
or
the
spirit
of
the
age
as
curius
was
sitting
at
his
hearth
the
samnites
who
brought
him
a
large
sum
of
gold
were
repulsed
by
him
for
it
was
not
lie
said
a
fine
thing
in
his
eyes
to
possess
gold
but
to
rule
those
who
possessed
it
could
such
a
high
spirit
fail
to
make
old
age
pleasant
but
to
return
to
farmers
not
to
wander
from
my
own
metier
tn
those
days
there
were
senators
old
men
on
their
farms
for
quinctius
cincinnatus
was
actually
at
the
plough
when
word
was
brought
him
that
he
had
been
named
dictator
it
was
by
his
order
as
dictator
by
the
way
that
servilius
ahala
the
master
of
the
horse
seized
and
put
to
death
spurius
maelius
when
attempting
to
obtain
royal
power
curius
as
well
as
other
old
men
used
to
receive
their
summonses
to
attend
the
senate
in
their
from
which
circumstance
the
summoners
were
called
or
travellers
was
these
men
old
age
an
object
of
pity
who
found
their
pleasure
in
the
cultivation
of
the
land
in
my
opinion
scarcely
any
life
can
be
more
blessed
not
alone
from
its
utility
for
agriculture
is
beneficial
to
the
whole
human
race
but
also
as
much
from
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
thing
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
and
from
the
rich
abundance
and
supply
of
all
things
necessary
for
the
food
of
man
and
for
the
worship
of
the
gods
above
so
as
these
are
objects
of
desire
to
certain
people
let
us
make
our
peace
with
pleasure
for
the
good
and
and
as
well
as
his
larder
are
always
well
filled
and
his
whole
is
richly
furnished
it
abounds
in
pigs
goats
lambs
fowls
milk
cheese
and
honey
then
there
is
the
garden
which
the
farmers
themselves
call
their
second
flitch
a
zest
and
flavour
is
added
to
all
these
by
hunting
and
fowling
in
spare
hours
need
i
mention
the
greenery
of
meadows
the
rows
of
trees
the
beauty
of
vineyard
and
i
put
it
briefly
nothing
can
either
furnish
necessaries
more
richly
or
present
a
fairer
spectacle
than
land
and
to
the
enjoyment
of
that
old
age
does
not
merely
present
no
hindrance
it
actually
invites
and
allures
to
it
for
where
else
can
it
better
warm
itself
either
by
basking
in
the
sun
or
by
sitting
by
the
fire
or
at
the
proper
time
cool
itself
more
wholesomely
by
the
help
of
shade
or
water
let
the
young
keep
their
arms
then
to
themselves
their
horses
spears
their
foils
and
ball
their
swimming
baths
and
running
path
to
us
old
men
let
them
out
of
the
many
forms
of
sport
leave
dice
and
counters
but
even
that
as
they
choose
since
old
age
can
be
quite
happy
without
them
xenophon
books
are
very
useful
for
many
purposes
pray
go
on
reading
them
with
attention
as
you
have
ever
done
in
what
ample
terms
is
agriculture
lauded
by
him
in
the
book
about
husbanding
property
which
is
called
but
to
show
you
that
he
thought
nothing
so
worthy
of
a
prince
as
the
taste
for
cultivating
the
soil
i
will
translate
what
socrates
says
to
critobulus
in
that
book
when
that
most
gallant
lacedaemonian
lysander
came
to
visit
the
persian
prince
cyrus
at
sardis
so
eminent
for
his
character
and
the
glory
of
his
rule
bringing
him
presents
from
his
allies
he
treated
lysander
in
all
ways
with
courteous
familiarity
and
kindness
and
among
other
things
took
him
to
see
a
certain
park
carefully
planted
lysander
expressed
admiration
of
the
height
of
the
trees
and
the
exact
arrangement
of
their
rows
in
the
quincunx
the
careful
cultivation
of
the
soil
its
freedom
from
weeds
and
the
sweetness
of
the
odours
exhaled
from
the
flowers
and
went
on
to
say
that
what
he
admired
was
not
the
industry
only
but
also
the
skill
of
the
man
by
whom
this
had
been
planned
and
laid
out
cyrus
replied
it
was
i
who
planned
the
whole
thing
these
rows
are
my
doing
the
laying
out
is
all
mine
many
of
the
trees
were
even
planted
by
own
hand
then
lysander
looking
at
his
purple
robe
the
brilliance
of
his
person
and
his
adornment
persian
fashion
with
gold
and
many
jewels
said
are
quite
right
cyrus
to
call
you
happy
since
the
advantages
of
high
fortune
have
been
joined
to
an
excellence
like
yours
this
kind
of
good
fortune
then
it
is
in
the
power
of
old
men
to
enjoy
nor
is
age
any
bar
to
our
maintaining
pursuits
of
every
other
kind
and
especially
of
agriculture
to
the
very
extreme
verge
of
old
age
for
instance
we
have
it
on
record
that
valerius
corvus
kept
it
up
to
his
hundredth
year
living
on
his
land
and
cultivating
it
after
his
active
career
was
over
though
between
his
first
and
sixth
consulships
there
was
an
interval
of
six
and
forty
years
so
that
he
had
an
official
career
lasting
the
number
of
years
which
our
ancestors
defined
as
coming
between
birth
and
the
beginning
of
old
age
moreover
that
last
period
of
his
old
age
was
more
blessed
than
that
of
his
middle
life
inasmuch
as
he
had
greater
influence
and
less
labour
for
the
crowning
grace
of
old
age
is
influence
how
great
was
that
of
caecilius
metellus
how
great
that
of
atilius
calatinus
over
whom
the
famous
epitaph
was
placed
very
many
classes
agree
in
deeming
this
to
have
been
the
very
first
man
of
the
nation
the
line
cut
on
his
tomb
is
well
known
it
is
natural
then
that
a
man
should
have
had
influence
in
whose
praise
the
verdict
of
history
is
unanimous
again
in
recent
times
what
a
great
man
was
publius
crassus
pontifex
maximus
and
his
successor
in
the
same
office
lepidus
i
need
scarcely
mention
paulus
or
africanus
or
as
i
did
before
maximus
it
was
not
only
their
senatorial
utterances
that
had
weight
their
least
gesture
had
it
also
in
fact
old
age
especially
when
it
has
enjoyed
honours
has
an
influence
worth
all
the
pleasures
of
youth
put
together
but
throughout
my
discourse
remember
that
my
panegyric
applies
to
an
old
age
that
has
been
established
on
foundations
laid
by
youth
from
which
may
be
deduced
what
i
once
said
with
universal
applause
that
it
was
a
wretched
old
age
that
had
to
defend
itself
by
speech
neither
white
hairs
nor
wrinkles
can
at
once
claim
influence
in
themselves
it
is
the
honourable
conduct
of
earlier
days
that
is
rewarded
by
possessing
influence
at
the
last
even
things
generally
regarded
as
trifling
and
matters
of
course
being
saluted
being
courted
having
way
made
for
one
people
rising
when
one
approaches
being
escorted
to
and
from
the
forum
being
referred
to
for
advice
all
these
are
marks
of
respect
observed
among
us
and
in
other
states
always
most
sedulously
where
the
moral
tone
is
highest
they
say
that
lysander
the
spartan
whom
i
have
mentioned
before
used
to
remark
that
sparta
was
the
most
dignified
home
for
old
age
for
that
nowhere
was
more
respect
paid
to
years
was
old
age
held
in
higher
honour
nay
the
story
is
told
of
how
when
a
man
of
advanced
years
came
into
the
theatre
at
athens
when
the
games
were
going
on
no
place
was
given
him
anywhere
in
that
large
assembly
by
his
own
countrymen
but
when
he
came
near
the
lacedaemonians
who
as
ambassadors
had
a
fixed
place
assigned
to
them
they
rose
as
one
man
out
of
respect
for
him
and
gave
the
veteran
a
seat
when
they
were
greeted
with
rounds
of
applause
from
the
whole
audience
one
of
them
remarked
the
athenians
know
what
is
right
but
will
not
do
it
there
are
many
excellent
rules
in
our
augural
college
but
among
the
best
is
one
which
affects
our
subject
that
precedence
in
speech
goes
by
seniority
and
augurs
who
are
older
are
preferred
only
to
those
who
have
held
higher
office
but
even
to
those
who
are
actually
in
possession
of
imperium
what
then
are
the
physical
pleasures
to
be
compared
with
the
reward
of
influence
those
who
have
employed
it
with
distinction
appear
to
me
to
have
played
the
drama
of
life
to
its
end
and
not
to
have
broken
down
in
the
last
act
like
unpractised
players
but
it
will
be
said
old
men
are
fretful
fidgety
and
disagreeable
if
you
come
to
that
they
are
also
avaricious
but
these
are
faults
of
character
not
of
the
time
of
life
and
after
all
fretfulness
and
the
other
faults
i
mentioned
admit
of
some
excuse
not
indeed
a
complete
one
but
one
that
may
possibly
pass
muster
they
think
themselves
neglected
looked
down
upon
mocked
besides
with
bodily
weakness
every
rub
is
a
source
of
pain
yet
all
these
faults
are
softened
both
by
good
character
and
good
education
illustrations
of
this
may
be
found
in
real
life
as
also
on
the
stage
in
the
case
of
the
brothers
in
the
what
harshness
in
the
one
what
gracious
manners
in
the
other
the
fact
is
that
just
as
it
is
not
every
wine
so
it
is
not
every
life
that
turns
sour
from
keeping
serious
gravity
i
approve
of
in
old
age
but
as
in
other
things
it
must
be
within
due
limits
bitterness
i
can
in
no
case
approve
what
the
object
of
senile
avarice
may
be
i
can
not
conceive
for
can
there
be
anything
more
absurd
than
to
seek
more
journey
money
the
less
there
remains
of
the
journey
there
remains
the
fourth
reason
which
more
than
anything
else
appears
to
torment
men
of
my
age
and
keep
them
in
a
flutter
the
nearness
of
death
which
it
must
be
allowed
can
not
be
far
from
an
old
man
but
what
a
poor
dotard
must
he
be
who
has
not
learnt
in
the
course
of
so
long
a
life
that
death
is
not
a
thing
to
be
feared
death
that
is
either
to
be
totally
disregarded
if
it
entirely
extinguishes
the
soul
or
is
even
to
be
desired
if
it
brings
him
where
he
is
to
exist
forever
a
third
alternative
at
any
rate
can
not
possibly
be
discovered
why
then
should
i
be
afraid
if
i
am
destined
either
not
to
be
miserable
after
death
or
even
to
be
happy
after
all
who
is
such
a
fool
as
to
feel
certain
however
young
he
may
be
that
he
will
be
alive
in
the
evening
nay
that
time
of
life
has
many
more
chances
of
death
than
ours
young
men
more
easily
contract
diseases
their
illnesses
are
more
serious
their
treatment
has
to
be
more
severe
accordingly
only
a
few
arrive
at
old
age
if
that
were
not
so
life
would
be
conducted
better
and
more
wisely
for
it
is
in
old
men
that
thought
reason
and
prudence
are
to
be
found
and
if
there
had
been
no
old
men
states
would
never
have
existed
at
all
but
i
return
to
the
subject
of
the
imminence
of
death
what
sort
of
charge
is
this
against
old
age
when
you
see
that
it
is
shared
by
youth
i
had
reason
in
the
case
of
my
excellent
son
as
you
had
scipio
in
that
of
your
brothers
who
were
expected
to
attain
the
highest
honours
to
realise
that
death
is
common
to
every
time
of
life
yes
you
will
say
but
a
young
man
expects
to
live
long
an
old
man
can
not
expect
to
do
so
well
he
is
a
fool
to
expect
it
for
what
can
be
more
foolish
than
to
regard
the
uncertain
as
certain
the
false
as
true
an
old
man
has
nothing
even
to
hope
ah
but
it
is
just
there
that
he
is
in
a
better
position
than
a
young
man
since
what
the
latter
only
hopes
he
has
obtained
the
one
wishes
to
live
long
the
other
has
lived
long
and
yet
good
heaven
what
is
long
in
a
man
life
for
grant
the
utmost
limit
let
us
expect
an
age
like
that
of
the
king
of
the
tartessi
for
there
was
as
i
find
recorded
a
certain
agathonius
at
gades
who
reigned
eighty
years
and
lived
a
hundred
and
twenty
but
to
my
mind
nothing
seems
even
long
in
which
there
is
any
last
for
when
that
arrives
then
all
the
past
has
slipped
away
only
that
remains
to
which
you
have
attained
by
virtue
and
righteous
actions
hours
indeed
and
days
and
months
and
years
depart
nor
does
past
time
ever
return
nor
can
the
future
be
known
whatever
time
each
is
granted
for
life
with
that
he
is
bound
to
be
content
an
actor
in
order
to
earn
approval
is
not
bound
to
perform
the
play
from
beginning
to
end
let
him
only
satisfy
the
audience
in
whatever
act
he
appears
nor
need
a
wise
man
go
on
to
the
concluding
plaudite
for
a
short
term
of
life
is
long
enough
for
living
well
and
honourably
but
if
you
go
farther
you
have
no
more
right
to
grumble
than
farmers
do
because
the
charm
of
the
spring
season
is
past
and
the
summer
and
autumn
have
come
for
the
word
spring
in
a
way
suggests
youth
and
points
to
the
harvest
to
be
the
other
seasons
are
suited
for
the
reaping
and
storing
of
the
crops
now
the
harvest
of
old
age
is
as
i
have
often
said
the
memory
and
rich
store
of
blessings
laid
up
in
easier
life
again
all
things
that
accord
with
nature
are
to
be
counted
as
good
but
what
can
be
more
in
accordance
with
nature
than
for
old
men
to
die
a
thing
indeed
which
also
beliefs
young
men
though
nature
revolts
and
fights
against
it
accordingly
the
death
of
young
men
seems
to
me
like
putting
out
a
great
fire
with
a
deluge
of
water
but
old
men
die
like
a
fire
going
out
because
it
has
burnt
down
of
its
own
nature
without
artificial
means
again
just
as
apples
when
unripe
are
torn
from
trees
but
when
ripe
and
mellow
drop
down
so
it
is
violence
that
takes
life
from
young
men
ripeness
from
old
this
ripeness
is
so
delightful
to
me
that
as
i
approach
nearer
to
death
i
seem
as
it
were
to
be
sighting
land
and
to
be
coming
to
port
at
last
after
a
long
voyage
again
there
is
no
fixed
borderline
for
old
age
and
you
are
making
a
good
and
proper
use
of
it
as
long
as
you
can
satisfy
the
call
of
duty
and
disregard
death
the
result
of
this
is
that
old
age
is
even
more
confident
and
courageous
than
youth
that
is
the
meaning
of
answer
to
the
tyrant
pisistratus
when
the
latter
asked
him
what
he
relied
upon
in
opposing
him
with
such
boldness
he
is
said
to
have
replied
on
my
old
age
but
that
end
of
life
is
the
best
when
without
the
intellect
or
senses
being
impaired
nature
herself
takes
to
pieces
her
own
handiwork
which
she
also
put
together
just
as
the
builder
of
a
ship
or
a
house
can
break
them
up
more
easily
than
any
one
else
so
the
nature
that
knit
together
the
human
frame
can
also
best
unfasten
it
moreover
a
thing
freshly
glued
together
is
always
difficult
to
pull
asunder
if
old
this
is
easily
done
the
result
is
that
the
short
time
of
life
left
to
them
is
not
to
be
grasped
at
by
old
men
with
greedy
eagerness
or
abandoned
without
cause
pythagoras
forbids
us
without
an
order
from
our
commander
that
is
god
to
desert
life
fortress
and
outpost
solon
epitaph
indeed
is
that
of
a
wise
man
in
which
he
says
that
he
does
not
wish
his
death
to
be
unaccompanied
by
the
sorrow
and
lamentations
of
his
friends
he
wants
i
suppose
to
be
beloved
by
them
but
i
rather
think
ennius
says
better
none
grace
me
with
their
tears
nor
weeping
loud
make
sad
my
funeral
rites
he
holds
that
a
death
is
not
a
subject
for
mourning
when
it
is
followed
by
immortality
again
there
may
possibly
be
some
sensation
of
dying
and
that
only
for
a
short
time
especially
in
the
case
of
an
old
man
after
death
indeed
sensation
is
either
what
one
would
desire
or
it
disappears
altogether
but
to
disregard
death
is
a
lesson
which
must
be
studied
from
our
youth
up
for
unless
that
is
learnt
no
one
can
have
a
quiet
mind
for
die
we
certainly
must
and
that
too
without
being
certain
whether
it
may
not
be
this
very
day
as
death
therefore
is
hanging
over
our
head
every
hour
how
can
a
man
ever
be
unshaken
in
soul
if
he
fears
it
but
on
this
theme
i
do
think
i
need
much
enlarge
when
i
remember
what
lucius
brutus
did
who
was
killed
while
defending
his
country
or
the
two
decii
who
spurred
their
horses
to
a
gallop
and
met
a
voluntary
death
or
atilius
regulus
who
left
his
home
to
confront
a
death
of
torture
rather
than
break
the
word
which
lie
had
pledged
to
the
enemy
or
the
two
scipios
who
determined
to
block
the
carthaginian
advance
even
with
their
own
bodies
or
your
grandfather
lucius
paulus
who
paid
with
his
life
for
the
rashness
of
his
colleague
in
the
disgrace
at
cannae
or
marcellus
whose
death
not
even
the
most
bloodthirsty
of
enemies
would
allow
to
go
without
the
honour
of
burial
it
is
enough
to
recall
that
our
legions
as
i
have
recorded
in
my
have
often
marched
with
cheerful
and
lofty
spirit
to
ground
from
which
they
believed
that
they
would
never
return
that
therefore
which
young
men
not
only
uninstructed
but
absolutely
ignorant
treat
as
of
no
account
shall
men
who
are
neither
young
nor
ignorant
shrink
from
in
terror
as
a
general
truth
as
it
seems
to
me
it
is
weariness
of
all
pursuits
that
creates
weariness
of
life
there
are
certain
pursuits
adapted
to
childhood
do
young
men
miss
them
there
are
others
suited
to
early
manhood
does
that
settled
time
of
life
called
middle
age
ask
for
them
there
are
others
again
suited
to
that
age
but
not
looked
for
in
old
age
there
are
finally
some
which
belong
to
old
age
therefore
as
the
pursuits
of
the
earlier
ages
have
their
time
for
disappearing
so
also
have
those
of
old
age
and
when
that
takes
place
a
satiety
of
life
brings
on
the
ripe
time
for
death
for
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
not
venture
to
tell
you
my
personal
opinion
as
to
death
of
which
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
a
clearer
vision
in
proportion
as
i
am
nearer
to
it
i
believe
scipio
and
laelius
that
your
fathers
those
illustrious
men
and
my
dearest
friends
are
still
alive
and
that
too
with
a
life
which
alone
deserves
the
name
for
as
long
as
we
are
imprisoned
in
this
framework
of
the
body
we
perform
a
certain
function
and
laborious
work
assigned
us
by
fate
the
soul
in
fact
is
of
heavenly
origin
forced
down
from
its
home
in
the
highest
and
so
to
speak
buried
in
earth
a
place
quite
opposed
to
its
divine
nature
and
its
immortality
but
i
suppose
the
immortal
gods
to
have
sown
souls
broadcast
in
human
bodies
that
there
might
be
some
to
survey
the
world
and
while
contemplating
the
order
of
the
heavenly
bodies
to
imitate
it
in
the
unvarying
regularity
of
their
life
nor
is
it
only
reason
and
arguments
that
have
brought
me
to
this
belief
but
the
great
fame
and
authority
of
the
most
distinguished
philosophers
i
used
to
be
told
that
pythagoras
and
the
pythagoreans
almost
natives
of
our
country
who
in
old
times
had
been
called
the
italian
school
of
philosophers
never
doubted
that
we
had
souls
drafted
from
the
universal
divine
intelligence
i
used
besides
to
have
pointed
out
to
me
the
discourse
delivered
by
socrates
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
upon
the
immortality
of
the
soul
socrates
who
was
pronounced
by
the
oracle
at
delphi
to
be
the
wisest
of
men
i
need
say
no
more
i
have
convinced
myself
and
i
hold
in
view
of
the
rapid
movement
of
the
soul
its
vivid
memory
of
the
past
and
its
prophetic
knowledge
of
the
future
its
many
accomplishments
its
vast
range
of
knowledge
its
numerous
discoveries
that
a
nature
embracing
such
varied
gifts
can
not
itself
be
mortal
and
since
the
soul
is
always
in
motion
and
yet
has
no
external
source
of
motion
for
it
is
i
conclude
that
it
will
also
have
no
end
to
its
motion
because
it
is
not
likely
ever
to
abandon
itself
again
since
the
nature
of
the
soul
is
not
composite
nor
has
in
it
any
admixture
that
is
not
homogeneous
and
similar
i
conclude
that
it
is
indivisible
and
if
indivisible
that
it
can
not
perish
it
is
again
a
strong
proof
of
men
knowing
most
things
before
birth
that
when
mere
children
they
grasp
innumerable
facts
with
such
speed
as
to
show
that
they
are
not
then
taking
them
in
for
the
first
time
but
remembering
and
recalling
them
this
is
roughly
plato
argument
once
more
in
xenophon
we
have
the
elder
cyrus
on
his
deathbed
speaking
as
follows
do
not
suppose
my
dearest
sons
that
when
i
have
left
you
i
shall
be
nowhere
and
no
one
even
when
i
was
with
you
you
did
not
see
my
soul
but
knew
that
it
was
in
this
body
of
mine
from
what
i
did
believe
then
that
it
is
still
the
same
even
though
you
see
it
not
the
honours
paid
to
illustrious
men
had
not
continued
to
exist
after
their
death
had
the
souls
of
these
very
men
not
done
something
to
make
us
retain
our
recollection
of
them
beyond
the
ordinary
time
for
myself
i
never
could
be
persuaded
that
souls
while
in
mortal
bodies
were
alive
and
died
directly
they
left
them
nor
in
fact
that
the
soul
only
lost
all
intelligence
when
it
left
the
unintelligent
body
i
believe
rather
that
when
by
being
liberated
from
all
corporeal
admixture
it
has
begun
to
be
pure
and
undefiled
it
is
then
that
it
becomes
wise
and
again
when
man
natural
frame
is
resolved
into
its
elements
by
death
it
is
clearly
seen
whither
each
of
the
other
elements
departs
for
they
all
go
to
the
place
from
which
they
came
but
the
soul
alone
is
invisible
alike
when
present
and
when
departing
once
more
you
see
that
nothing
is
so
like
death
as
sleep
and
yet
it
is
in
sleepers
that
souls
most
clearly
reveal
their
divine
nature
for
they
foresee
many
events
when
they
are
allowed
to
escape
and
are
left
free
this
shows
what
they
are
likely
to
be
when
they
have
completely
freed
themselves
from
the
fetters
of
the
body
wherefore
if
these
things
are
so
obey
me
as
a
god
but
if
my
soul
is
to
perish
with
my
body
nevertheless
do
you
from
awe
of
the
gods
who
guard
and
govern
this
fair
universe
preserve
my
memory
by
the
loyalty
and
piety
of
your
lives
such
are
the
words
of
the
dying
cyrus
i
will
now
with
your
good
leave
look
at
home
no
one
my
dear
scipio
shall
ever
persuade
me
that
your
father
paulus
and
your
two
grandfathers
paulus
and
africanus
or
the
father
of
africanus
or
his
uncle
or
many
other
illustrious
men
not
necessary
to
mention
would
have
attempted
such
lofty
deeds
as
to
be
remaindered
by
posterity
had
they
not
seen
in
their
minds
that
future
ages
concerned
them
do
you
suppose
to
take
an
old
man
privilege
of
a
little
that
i
should
have
been
likely
to
undertake
such
heavy
labours
by
day
and
night
at
home
and
abroad
if
i
had
been
destined
to
have
the
same
limit
to
my
glory
as
to
my
life
had
it
not
been
much
better
to
pass
an
age
of
ease
and
repose
without
any
labour
or
exertion
but
my
soul
i
know
not
how
refusing
to
be
kept
down
ever
fixed
its
eyes
upon
future
ages
as
though
from
a
conviction
that
it
would
begin
to
live
only
when
it
had
left
the
body
but
had
it
not
been
the
case
that
souls
were
immortal
it
would
not
have
been
the
souls
of
all
the
best
men
that
made
the
greatest
efforts
after
an
immortality
of
fame
again
is
there
not
the
fact
that
the
wisest
man
ever
dies
with
the
greatest
cheerfulness
the
most
unwise
with
the
least
do
you
think
that
the
soul
which
has
the
clearer
and
longer
sight
sees
that
it
is
starting
for
better
things
while
the
soul
whose
vision
is
dimmer
does
not
see
it
for
my
part
i
am
transported
with
the
desire
to
see
your
fathers
who
were
the
object
of
my
reverence
and
affection
nor
is
it
only
those
whom
i
knew
that
i
long
to
see
it
is
those
also
of
whom
i
have
been
told
and
have
read
whom
i
have
myself
recorded
in
my
history
when
i
am
setting
out
for
that
there
is
certainly
no
one
who
will
find
it
easy
to
draw
me
back
or
boil
me
up
again
like
second
pelios
nay
if
some
god
should
grant
me
to
renew
my
childhood
from
my
present
age
and
once
more
to
be
crying
in
my
cradle
i
would
firmly
refuse
nor
should
i
in
truth
be
willing
after
having
as
it
were
run
the
full
course
to
be
recalled
from
the
winning
crease
to
the
barriers
for
what
blessing
has
life
to
offer
should
we
not
rather
say
what
labour
but
granting
that
it
has
at
any
rate
it
has
after
all
a
limit
either
to
enjoyment
or
to
existence
i
do
wish
to
depreciate
life
as
many
men
and
good
philosophers
have
often
done
nor
do
i
regret
having
lived
for
i
have
done
so
in
a
way
that
lets
me
think
that
i
was
not
born
in
vain
but
i
quit
life
as
i
would
an
inn
not
as
i
would
a
home
for
nature
has
given
us
a
place
of
entertainment
not
of
residence
oh
glorious
day
when
i
shall
set
out
to
join
that
heavenly
conclave
and
company
of
souls
and
depart
from
the
turmoil
and
impurities
of
this
world
for
i
shall
not
go
to
join
only
those
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
but
also
my
son
cato
than
whom
no
better
man
was
ever
born
nor
one
more
conspicuous
for
piety
his
body
was
burnt
by
me
though
mine
ought
on
the
contrary
to
have
been
burnt
by
him
but
his
spirit
not
abandoning
but
ever
looking
back
upon
me
has
certainly
gone
whither
he
saw
that
i
too
must
come
i
was
thought
to
bear
that
loss
heroically
not
that
i
really
bore
it
without
distress
but
i
found
my
own
consolation
in
the
thought
that
the
parting
and
separation
between
us
was
not
to
be
for
long
it
is
by
these
means
my
dear
scipio
for
you
said
that
you
and
laelius
were
wont
to
express
surprise
on
this
point
that
my
old
age
sits
lightly
on
me
and
is
not
only
not
oppressive
but
even
delightful
but
if
i
am
wrong
in
thinking
the
human
soul
immortal
i
am
glad
to
be
wrong
nor
will
i
allow
the
mistake
which
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
to
be
wrested
from
me
as
long
as
i
live
but
if
when
dead
as
some
insignificant
philosophers
think
i
am
to
be
without
sensation
i
am
not
afraid
of
dead
philosophers
deriding
my
errors
again
if
we
are
not
to
be
immortal
it
is
nevertheless
what
a
man
must
wish
to
have
his
life
end
at
its
proper
time
for
nature
puts
a
limit
to
living
as
to
everything
else
now
old
age
is
as
it
were
the
playing
out
of
the
drama
the
full
fatigue
of
which
we
should
shun
especially
when
we
also
feel
that
we
have
had
more
than
enough
of
it
this
is
all
i
had
to
say
on
old
age
i
pray
that
you
may
arrive
at
it
that
you
may
put
my
words
to
a
practical
test
